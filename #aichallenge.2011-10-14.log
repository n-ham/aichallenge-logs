2011-10-14T00:23:10  <jbroman> If the name is no longer Google AI Challenge, the /topic should probably be changed.
2011-10-14T00:23:23  <jbroman> The phrase "Official Google AI Challenge" is particularly misleading.

2011-10-14T00:24:14  <Zannick> is the site still the same?
2011-10-14T00:25:44  <jbroman> I'm not sure what's changing when; I just wanted to make sure it wasn't overlooked before launch.
2011-10-14T00:26:19  <jbroman> I'm sure amstan or j3camero knows where we finally landed, but I thought "AI Challenge (sponsored by Google)" was where we ended up last I heard.
2011-10-14T00:26:30  <Zannick> yes, that is what i've been told
2011-10-14T00:26:52  <Zannick> i will leave the site as is for now

2011-10-14T14:43:23  <antimatroid> more like fell on my face
2011-10-14T14:43:45  <antimatroid> spent 4 hours in hospitable, got stitches and had to get my uncle (dentist) out of bed in the middle of the night
2011-10-14T14:43:55  <antimatroid> i'm still not entirely sure as to what happened
2011-10-14T14:44:27  <Zannick> ouch
2011-10-14T14:45:19  * mcstar sends antimatroid an irc get well message
2011-10-14T14:47:45  <antimatroid> :)
2011-10-14T14:47:55  <antimatroid> she'll be right, i just wish I knew wtf happened aha
2011-10-14T14:49:16  <mcstar> seems to me a sex-changeing operation took place
2011-10-14T14:49:44  <antimatroid> hhehe :P
2011-10-14T14:50:14  <mcstar> excuse my curiosity, were you sober? or why else dont you know what happened?
2011-10-14T14:50:25  <antimatroid> no, i was blackout drunk :)
2011-10-14T14:50:37  <mcstar> ok, i am relieved
2011-10-14T14:50:58  <antimatroid> had to get stitches on my chin, big graze next to my eye and dental work on one of my teeth, very very poor form
2011-10-14T14:51:41  <mcstar> i guess you had a bad fall, friend of mine had a similar experience
2011-10-14T14:52:31  <mcstar> were you cycling?? i can imagine you were
2011-10-14T14:53:16  <antimatroid> i'm not sure aha
2011-10-14T14:53:21  <antimatroid> my bike was locked up at uni
2011-10-14T14:53:35  <antimatroid> i don't think this happened from the bike though, so hopefully that's still locked up at uni
2011-10-14T14:53:42  <antimatroid> i was at a barrel aha :)
2011-10-14T14:54:36  * mcstar finds a fitting definition of barrel
2011-10-14T14:55:34  <mcstar> doesnt make sense to me, unless you really mean that people found you in an iron barrel?
2011-10-14T14:56:14  <antimatroid> barrel is just a name for societies selling alcohol and people getting wasted
2011-10-14T14:56:25  <antimatroid> back in the day they would have had actual barrels of beer but not anymore
2011-10-14T14:56:48  <mcstar> i see
