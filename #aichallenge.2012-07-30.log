2012-07-30T11:20:45  <delt0r> wibble...
2012-07-30T11:22:28  <mcstar> wobble...
2012-07-30T11:24:02  <mleise> mcstar: hi. i implemented your proposed ternary search tree for comparison
2012-07-30T11:24:44  <mleise> it uses more memory and it is slower. i keep my trie -.-
2012-07-30T11:25:35  <mcstar> mleise: you are a lousy programmer, thats all
2012-07-30T11:25:39  <mleise> on the other hand I'll add a radix tree to the comparison
2012-07-30T11:26:07  <mcstar> XD
2012-07-30T11:26:21  <mleise> mcstar: or maybe I want to write the code in a biased way, so the trie is always the fastest ;)
2012-07-30T11:26:31  <mcstar> or that
2012-07-30T11:26:54  <mcstar> maybe D is inherently bad for ternary search trees
2012-07-30T11:27:07  <mcstar> (now you have to prove me wrong!)
2012-07-30T11:27:13  <mcstar> (reversed psychology)
2012-07-30T11:27:22  <mleise> yes, of course. the more pointers you use in your code the more difficult it is for the GC to collect garbage
2012-07-30T11:27:42  <mleise> so D is inherently bad for trees
2012-07-30T11:28:01  <mleise> but I didn't use the GC here, just manual memory allocation like in C
2012-07-30T11:29:00  <mleise> also you wouldn't believe how much the CPU cache can skew the results
2012-07-30T11:30:06  <mcstar> what i dont really understand, is that is uses more memory than the other one
2012-07-30T11:30:15  <mcstar> delt0r: how did the meetup go?
2012-07-30T11:34:59  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!~Miranda@31.144.253.171> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2012-07-30T11:39:27  <mleise> mcstar: easily explained: a node in the trie uses 16 bytes and a node in the ternary search tree uses 32 bytes
2012-07-30T11:40:26  <mcstar> 16?
2012-07-30T11:40:31  <mleise> plus i added additional nodes for the terminating 0 character in the TST
2012-07-30T11:41:50  <mleise> 16 bytes is the base line, yes. just a pointer to an array of sub-nodes aka children, 1 byte for the boolean data (i.e. contained/not contained), 2 bytes for first/last character in children list
2012-07-30T11:42:13  <mleise> so actually 7 bytes, but padded to 8
2012-07-30T11:42:31  <mleise> and 15 padded to 16 on 64-bit
2012-07-30T11:43:45  <mleise> and for the cache effects: querying the trie in sorted order: 12 ms (was ~80ms in the old impl.), querying in random order: 69 ms
2012-07-30T11:44:31  <mleise> so using a sorted dictionary for insertion/lookup is actually bad for a benchmark :D
2012-07-30T11:45:17  <mleise> the "real world" performance is much more likely the 69 ms
2012-07-30T11:46:14  <mleise> oh I also switched from 64-bit to 32-bit for smaller pointer sizes
2012-07-30T11:46:35  <mcstar> how?
2012-07-30T11:47:23  <mcstar> if you do memory management yourself, you can use pointers of arbitrary sizes
2012-07-30T11:47:31  <mleise> how i switched? compiled with -m32.
2012-07-30T11:47:46  <mcstar> like allocating a chunk of memory, and using it as a base address
2012-07-30T11:47:55  <mcstar> mleise: you are full of cheats
2012-07-30T11:48:11  <mleise> that would be an array access instead of pointers
2012-07-30T11:48:20  <mcstar> hm?
2012-07-30T11:48:28  <mcstar> memory is an array
2012-07-30T11:48:38  <mcstar> a linearly addressable structure
2012-07-30T11:48:48  <mleise> uh... yes... don't confuse me
2012-07-30T11:49:11  <mleise> still you need to calculate base + size * index
2012-07-30T11:49:27  <mleise> instead of just accessing the data through the pointer
2012-07-30T11:49:35  <mcstar> no
2012-07-30T11:49:54  <mcstar> (you can overload operators)
2012-07-30T11:50:45  <mcstar> it would be instructive for me to implement the tst in haskell
2012-07-30T11:50:50  <mcstar> but i dont have time for that
2012-07-30T11:51:20  <mleise> anyway it kinda artificially limits the data structure if i use pointer sizes of 16-bit for example
2012-07-30T11:51:33  <mcstar> same with 32
2012-07-30T11:51:36  <mleise> yes
2012-07-30T11:51:50  <mcstar> the difference is that you can set it with dmd
2012-07-30T11:51:52  <mleise> but on a 32-bit system you cannot have more memory anyway :p
2012-07-30T11:51:58  <mcstar> and dont have to write different code
2012-07-30T11:52:11  <mcstar> on a 32 bit system pointers are 32 bit long
2012-07-30T11:52:26  <mleise> Yes, the compiler helps me in cheating
2012-07-30T11:53:04  <mcstar> i dont understand this delt0r

2012-07-30T12:04:39  <mleise> but yeah, currant was new to me too
2012-07-30T12:05:09  <mleise> also there are lots of marketing names for old known fruits now
2012-07-30T12:06:03  <mleise> especially cassis
2012-07-30T12:07:46  <mleise> or rather the English names sound fresh and stylish over the native names.

2012-07-30T13:29:39  <delt0r> one it was expensive..
2012-07-30T13:29:51  <delt0r> two i now have run out of money
2012-07-30T13:30:01  <mcstar> heh
2012-07-30T13:30:11  <delt0r> and 3, i am shifting to Switzerland
2012-07-30T13:30:39  <mcstar> you should not have travelled by ship
2012-07-30T13:30:40  <delt0r> But i was pretty nice... really liked Quebec city
2012-07-30T13:30:53  <delt0r> ship would have been faster than plane!
2012-07-30T13:31:03  <mcstar> really?
2012-07-30T13:31:13  <mcstar> and i figure more expensive
2012-07-30T13:31:13  <delt0r> our outbound flights were very very delayed
2012-07-30T13:31:39  <mcstar> did you travel alone?
2012-07-30T13:31:40  <delt0r> many flights were canceled ... ours almost was
2012-07-30T13:31:57  <delt0r> My wife came with me this time... which was nice
2012-07-30T13:32:03  <delt0r> but 2x more expensive!
2012-07-30T13:33:05  <delt0r> anyway... as far as aichallenge is going... as long as jeff does the 20% thing or close I think it will pick up a lot of momentum

2012-07-30T18:34:10  <delt0r_> Got extra jalapeno's and xxx hot sauce... they thought that would be too hot

2012-07-30T18:35:05  <delt0r_> I figured it was something like that...
2012-07-30T18:35:11  <amstan> when you were there already
2012-07-30T18:35:50  <delt0r_> oh well...

2012-07-30T19:57:14  <amstan> antimatroid1: all the places i go have internet! why would a ton of money for a thing i won't use
2012-07-30T19:57:23  <amstan> the only reason i would want it is for moar internet
2012-07-30T19:57:34  <amstan> but i'm not going to pay 50 bucks a month for like a 3G cap
2012-07-30T20:22:22  <antimatroid1> similar to my thoughts, unless i'm already doing something with people, i'm already near both the net and some kind of landline
2012-07-30T20:22:38  <antimatroid1> and i don't like carrying excess crap in my pockets, don't even carry a wallet aroun
