2012-07-18T09:33:59  <mcstar> thestinger: getopt vs. argp?
2012-07-18T09:38:16  <thestinger> mcstar: in python?
2012-07-18T09:38:25  <mcstar> nah
2012-07-18T09:38:27  <mcstar> c++
2012-07-18T09:38:51  <mcstar> have you used any?
2012-07-18T09:38:54  <thestinger> oh
2012-07-18T09:38:57  <thestinger> I've used getopt in C
2012-07-18T09:39:06  <thestinger> haven't used argp
2012-07-18T09:39:07  <mcstar> impressions?
2012-07-18T09:39:38  <thestinger> I'm sure there's something better than getopt in C++
2012-07-18T09:39:40  <thestinger> it'
2012-07-18T09:39:42  <thestinger> it's pretty bad*
2012-07-18T09:40:14  <mcstar> argp seems better from a short description
2012-07-18T09:40:18  <mcstar> but it is still archaic
2012-07-18T09:40:41  <mcstar> i need to parameterize a simulation
2012-07-18T09:40:46  <thestinger> I dunno if there's an alternative other than the boost program_options one
2012-07-18T09:41:03  <mcstar> ill look into that
2012-07-18T09:41:30  <mcstar> thestinger: i have this program, that does fast opengl drawing, besides the simulation
2012-07-18T09:41:40  <mcstar> im thinking about making that part a standalone program
2012-07-18T09:42:02  <mcstar> and using some memory sharing technique to interface with it from othe rlanguages/runtimes
2012-07-18T09:43:06  <thestinger> you could expose a C API
2012-07-18T09:44:58  <mcstar> i was thinking of, memory mapping on the part of the caller
2012-07-18T09:45:08  <mcstar> and it would run as a separate thread
2012-07-18T09:45:22  <mcstar> and would incur minimal run-time overhead
2012-07-18T09:59:58  <mleise> worst of all getopt was ported to D in the standard library :D
2012-07-18T10:00:35  <mleise> I found the Python one much more powerful, from looking at it.
2012-07-18T10:00:55  <mleise> The included usage help for example is an obvious feature for a console application
2012-07-18T10:04:28  <mcstar> mawif:D
2012-07-18T10:04:31  <mcstar> fuck
2012-07-18T10:04:34  <mcstar> mleise:D
2012-07-18T10:05:04  <mleise> hey yo, whassup?
2012-07-18T10:05:22  <mleise> and what is mawif:D?
2012-07-18T10:05:32  <mcstar> mistabbed
2012-07-18T10:06:23  <mcstar> mleise:D is a little word-pun on D and :D
2012-07-18T10:07:30  <mleise> hey, I guess I could try to clone Python's ... whatever it is called
2012-07-18T10:08:02  <mleise> and then tell thestinger "hey, look what D has, that C++ doesn't have"
2012-07-18T10:08:40  <mcstar> hm?
2012-07-18T10:09:13  <mleise> You always lure people into using Haskell, so I thought I need something to lure some into using D.
2012-07-18T10:09:25  <mcstar> but D has already things that c++ doesnt
2012-07-18T10:09:36  <mcstar> and thestinger is a python expert
2012-07-18T10:09:53  <mleise> uh, that's a tough target audience
2012-07-18T10:10:44  <mleise> then again, he would probably like a Python feature in a native language
2012-07-18T10:11:23  <mcstar> FUCk
2012-07-18T10:11:51  <mcstar> im so fucked
2012-07-18T10:12:49  <mcstar> someone already applied monte carlo to pfc in 2008
2012-07-18T10:12:53  <mcstar> there goes my idea
2012-07-18T10:13:04  <mcstar> ill what i can save from it
2012-07-18T10:13:09  <mcstar> ill see*
2012-07-18T10:13:34  <mleise> pfc?
2012-07-18T10:14:05  <mcstar> a model im working on
2012-07-18T10:17:27  <mleise> was it your doctor thesis project?
2012-07-18T10:17:42  <mcstar> that is
2012-07-18T10:17:48  <mcstar> but not phd
2012-07-18T10:17:49  <mcstar> msc
2012-07-18T10:18:30  <mleise> oh well, i can imagine that is difficult

2012-07-18T10:19:22  <mleise> I would write about my special approach to Ants path finding. You know that one with the 10 pages of source code
2012-07-18T10:20:59  <mcstar> no i forgot
2012-07-18T10:21:06  <mcstar> j/k
2012-07-18T10:21:20  <mcstar> you never disclosed the whole code
2012-07-18T10:21:26  <mcstar> is it finished?
2012-07-18T10:21:42  <mleise> no, it makes my brain implode
2012-07-18T10:22:11  <mleise> it looks so simple on paper, but when I want to implement it, the code becomes longer and longer
2012-07-18T10:22:38  <mleise> as if it just wasn't made to be written in a programming language
2012-07-18T10:22:54  <mcstar> probably you should use continuation passing style
2012-07-18T10:23:09  <mleise> er.... heard that word before
2012-07-18T10:25:29  <antimatroid> errr... i go roped into something i don't think i should really be doing :|
2012-07-18T10:26:17  <antimatroid> i got asked the other day if i could do a 3 minute talk on my thesis stuff, which i thought was just to the maths faculty, then i get an email with me in the line up for some competition
2012-07-18T10:26:19  <mcstar> well, tell the other boys, you are not interested
2012-07-18T10:27:04  <antimatroid> i'll explain, the heat starts at 11am, it's 12:30am
2012-07-18T10:27:14  <antimatroid> then i was just checking the eligibility page from the email
2012-07-18T10:27:29  <antimatroid> "Competitors are requested to now do a reality check. Have you enough research material to compete?  The 3MT presentation is aimed at research students presenting their research findings. Do you have your supervisor’s, a mentor’s, your peer’s support?" I don't have any of those checked off
2012-07-18T10:27:35  <antimatroid> i wasn't told any of this before :|
2012-07-18T10:28:01  <mcstar> wait, i have a good adice
2012-07-18T10:28:03  <mcstar> it will fit

2012-07-18T10:33:46  <mcstar> which one?
2012-07-18T10:33:52  <antimatroid> mleise: well it was the maths office lady who asked me
2012-07-18T10:34:00  <mleise> lol
2012-07-18T10:34:01  <antimatroid> and the maths department did something like that last year, just because
2012-07-18T10:34:05  <antimatroid> so i assumed it was for that
2012-07-18T10:34:06  <mleise> go fuck yourself, office lady
2012-07-18T10:34:14  <antimatroid> haha, nah she's pretty cool
2012-07-18T10:34:18  <antimatroid> but what do i do?
2012-07-18T10:34:28  <antimatroid> they're only allowed to be one slide anyway
2012-07-18T10:34:37  <mleise> Tell them it was a misunderstanding
2012-07-18T10:34:41  <antimatroid> i might just make something but also email the guy saying err, probably shouldn't really be going in it
2012-07-18T10:34:47  <antimatroid> yeah i think i shall
2012-07-18T10:35:04  <antimatroid> wish i realised this earlier, i rescheduled plans cause of this thing :|
2012-07-18T10:35:05  <mleise> but 3 minutes wont kill you either
2012-07-18T10:35:13  <antimatroid> yeah, but i'll look like an idiot not having results
2012-07-18T10:35:22  <antimatroid> when it's clearly on that page they said to read in the email aha
2012-07-18T10:35:22  <mcstar> only for 3 minutes
2012-07-18T10:35:26  <mleise> no results is a show stopper ^^
2012-07-18T10:35:40  <mcstar> they cant figure out in 3 minutes that you dont have results
2012-07-18T10:35:51  <antimatroid> another alternative is to not talk about my thesis at all and talk about games instead aha
2012-07-18T10:36:07  <antimatroid> it'll take me three minutes just to explain words they wont understand
2012-07-18T10:36:16  <mleise> just talk gibberish with buzz words and after 3 minutes look at your clock and say "uh, i've got to go"
2012-07-18T10:36:16  <mcstar> here you go
2012-07-18T10:36:20  <mcstar> open with the glossary
2012-07-18T10:36:27  <mcstar> ooops, time up
2012-07-18T10:36:32  <mcstar> well, fellows, see you next time
2012-07-18T10:36:53  <antimatroid> an old friend hung himself yesterday too :|
2012-07-18T10:37:03  <antimatroid> i say old because i haven't talked to him in a while, but we weren't not friends
2012-07-18T10:37:19  <mcstar> i like the old not not friends of mine
2012-07-18T10:37:30  <mcstar> great persons an such
2012-07-18T10:37:34  <mcstar> and*
2012-07-18T10:37:36  <antimatroid> i mean, i would call him a friend
2012-07-18T10:37:43  <mcstar> oh
2012-07-18T10:37:50  <antimatroid> but it seems weird to say your friend passed away or whatever when you haven't really talked to them in a while
2012-07-18T10:37:58  <mcstar> yeah
2012-07-18T10:37:59  <antimatroid> it feels like you're taking away from those who are still quite close to them
2012-07-18T10:38:22  <mcstar> was it an accident?
2012-07-18T10:38:31  <mleise> he *hung* himself
2012-07-18T10:38:33  <mcstar> like, with carradine?
2012-07-18T10:38:34  <antimatroid> accidentally hung? :P
2012-07-18T10:38:51  <mcstar> well, you can hang yourself accidentally

2012-07-18T10:38:59  <mcstar> sry
2012-07-18T10:39:01  <mcstar> bondage
2012-07-18T10:39:13  <antimatroid> or just masterbating with a belt around your neck
2012-07-18T10:39:15  <mleise> you look the wrong movies man
2012-07-18T10:39:19  <mleise> *watch

2012-07-18T10:39:34  <mcstar> i knew it
2012-07-18T10:39:40  <antimatroid> i doubt it
2012-07-18T10:39:45  <antimatroid> but i have heard of that on the web
2012-07-18T10:39:47  <mcstar> you just said it
2012-07-18T10:39:55  <mcstar> ah, i see
2012-07-18T10:39:58  <antimatroid> i was adding to your bondage comment :P
2012-07-18T10:40:01  <mcstar> :)
2012-07-18T10:40:12  <mcstar> and im just twisting your words as always
2012-07-18T10:40:37  <mcstar> did he at least had a happy life?
2012-07-18T10:40:39  <mleise> antimatroid wonders if he could have talked him out of that
2012-07-18T10:40:46  <mcstar> stupid question
2012-07-18T10:41:08  <antimatroid> he never seemed like that kind of person
2012-07-18T10:41:14  <antimatroid> http://imgur.com/a/NoxHB#Rr9Xb
2012-07-18T10:41:16  <pairofdice> murder!
2012-07-18T10:41:21  <mcstar> one of my not not friend died at 19
2012-07-18T10:41:24  <antimatroid> those are old pics of him i dug up and put on fb
2012-07-18T10:41:42  <antimatroid> one of my friend's brother died a couple of years ago
2012-07-18T10:41:51  <antimatroid> he was found at the bottom of a drop/cliff
2012-07-18T10:42:02  <antimatroid> they say it wasn't suss, i've always been a bit iffy about it
2012-07-18T10:42:30  <mcstar> well, from the pictures, im not surprised
2012-07-18T10:42:41  <antimatroid> why not?
2012-07-18T10:42:47  <mcstar> kind of rebellious little guy
2012-07-18T10:42:56  <mleise> :)
2012-07-18T10:42:59  <antimatroid> what do you expect from skaters? :P
2012-07-18T10:43:01  <mleise> life loud, die young?
2012-07-18T10:43:02  <mcstar> and the whole skating act, scares me
2012-07-18T10:43:07  <mcstar> yeah
2012-07-18T10:43:18  <mcstar> i dont know these folks
2012-07-18T10:43:23  <mcstar> stayed far away from them
2012-07-18T10:43:34  <mcstar> (but then, it is true for almost any kind of group..)
2012-07-18T10:43:35  <antimatroid> i practically grew up at the skatepark
2012-07-18T10:44:18  <mcstar> rock out with your dick out!
2012-07-18T10:46:00  <mcstar> antimatroid: im not sure you were looking for this kind of treatment
2012-07-18T10:46:11  <mcstar> im sorry if i seem too insensitive
2012-07-18T10:46:27  <mcstar> my condolances, man
2012-07-18T10:46:29  <antimatroid> mcstar: dw, i'm fine
2012-07-18T10:47:02  <antimatroid> i care about intent of what people say, you should know i can be really offensive when people don't consider my intent :P
2012-07-18T10:47:49  <antimatroid> i dunno if the internet ruined me, but i don't really get affected by these kind of things, sure it sucks, but i am not oblivious to how life works
2012-07-18T10:49:05  <mcstar> well, it probably makes me a bad person, but i almost couldnt stop laughing at the funeral of my not not friend
2012-07-18T10:49:52  <pairofdice> Not bad, just strange :)
2012-07-18T10:50:00  <mcstar> the guy was always picked on, from elementrary, through high school, was an only child, and his parents were very protective of him
2012-07-18T10:50:13  <antimatroid> what was funny?
2012-07-18T10:50:19  <mcstar> maybe i was the closest thing to a friend to him in high school
2012-07-18T10:50:27  <mcstar> but hardly knew him
2012-07-18T10:50:37  <mcstar> anyway, after high school, he got a car
2012-07-18T10:50:48  <mcstar> 1 year later, comes the news, that he is dead
2012-07-18T10:50:56  <mcstar> and the old class was assembled to bury him
2012-07-18T10:51:10  <mcstar> he drove the car to a tree or something
2012-07-18T10:51:36  <mcstar> i remember that i didnt feel safe with him, when he drove, in his dad's old mustang
2012-07-18T10:51:53  <mcstar> so i wasnt surprised at all
2012-07-18T10:52:08  <mcstar> im not sure what was i laughing at
2012-07-18T10:52:10  <antimatroid> yeah, one of my friends used to drive unsafely
2012-07-18T10:52:12  <mcstar> probably the situation
2012-07-18T10:52:13  <antimatroid> he's grown up a bit now
2012-07-18T10:52:14  <pairofdice> mustangs aren't known for their safety
2012-07-18T10:52:24  <mcstar> he didnt die in the mustanf
2012-07-18T10:52:27  <mcstar> g
2012-07-18T10:52:35  <antimatroid> one of his good friends is now mentally and physically disabled from rolling his car
2012-07-18T10:52:40  <mcstar> he was given some modern city car
2012-07-18T10:52:42  <antimatroid> not with my good friend there
2012-07-18T10:53:38  <mcstar> a guy, couple of houses down the sreet, had a serious car accident
2012-07-18T10:53:45  <mcstar> at almost the same time, i had my fall
2012-07-18T10:53:59  <mcstar> poor guy still sits in the wheelchair, but he can talk now
2012-07-18T10:54:32  <mcstar> lol
2012-07-18T10:54:43  <mcstar> im running an doing pull/push ups
2012-07-18T10:54:51  <mcstar> all in all im so lucky
2012-07-18T10:55:12  <mleise> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMSI9kal5jg
2012-07-18T10:55:55  <antimatroid> yeah, i still consider myself pretty lucky from last october
2012-07-18T11:00:33  <antimatroid> bailing on that talk thing
2012-07-18T11:00:43  <antimatroid> sent the guy an email, not even going to turn up, meh :P
2012-07-18T11:01:06  <antimatroid> i'll check in the morning if my friend can still do our other plans otherwise go watch the other talks
