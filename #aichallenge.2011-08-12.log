2011-08-12T09:52:18  <rabidus> really.. i plugged in my usb gprs modem, started bearerbox and now whole server is acting like .. clown
2011-08-12T09:52:21  <rabidus> :D
2011-08-12T10:07:44  <antimatroid> oh gawd, notation is so complicated :\
2011-08-12T10:15:51  <mcstar> hm did you pass english grammar?
2011-08-12T10:16:02  <mcstar> its god for god's sake
2011-08-12T10:16:36  <mcstar> fsck, im soo busy
2011-08-12T10:16:42  <jbroman> mcstar: That's spelling, not grammar.
2011-08-12T10:16:55  <mcstar> jbroman: part of the joke
2011-08-12T10:17:12  <jbroman> mcstar: Hard to tell on IRC sometimes.
2011-08-12T10:17:13  <mcstar> does anyone keep improving his/her bot?
2011-08-12T10:17:56  <rabidus> stopped half a year ago
2011-08-12T10:17:58  <rabidus> :D
2011-08-12T10:18:04  <aerique> no
2011-08-12T10:18:16  <mcstar> oh, aerique didnt notice you
2011-08-12T10:18:31  <mcstar> did mcleo see the videos?
2011-08-12T10:19:10  <aerique> mcstar: yup
2011-08-12T10:19:36  <aerique> mcstar: just saw them on another machine.. sound's bad :-|
2011-08-12T10:19:57  <mcstar> well, not great, but its not bad
2011-08-12T10:20:15  <mcstar> you seem like wispering sometimes
2011-08-12T10:20:27  <aerique> yeah, first time for everything i guess
2011-08-12T10:20:34  <mcstar> (h)
2011-08-12T10:21:01  <aerique> mcstar: you've seen this already i guess?: http://www.indiegogo.com/SBCL-Threading-Improvements-1
2011-08-12T10:22:11  <mcstar> hehe
2011-08-12T10:22:17  <mcstar> no i havent seen it
2011-08-12T10:22:29  <mcstar> in fact i havent touched lisp/sbcl in a month
2011-08-12T10:22:39  <mcstar> im writing c/cuda nowadays
2011-08-12T10:22:51  <aerique> that's cool
2011-08-12T10:23:56  <mcstar> on the weekend ill read about posix threading
2011-08-12T10:24:27  <mcstar> i want two threads, one runs the simulation, the other one will provide some control over the first one's output
2011-08-12T10:26:30  <aerique> mcstar: what kind of sim?
2011-08-12T10:27:08  <mcstar> solidification, the phase field models
2011-08-12T10:27:49  <mcstar> theres production code for that, but now i have to make this study, to port the code for gpu, and see it it will be worth it
2011-08-12T10:28:08  <mcstar> to buy more gpus in the future, or to stay with cpu clusters
2011-08-12T10:30:01  <aerique> cool
2011-08-12T10:30:07  <mcstar> one of my collegues wrote a very succesful spectral solver for similar problems
2011-08-12T10:30:17  <mcstar> which runs over mpi
2011-08-12T10:30:29  <mcstar> but the spectral method limits the use of boundary conditions
2011-08-12T10:30:43  <mcstar> basically you can only have periodic bc
2011-08-12T10:31:02  <mcstar> and now im doing this with FD method, so this will be more flexible

2011-08-12T10:38:59  <antimatroid> i have 3 possible ordinal normal form game isomporphisms :\
