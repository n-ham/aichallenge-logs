2011-12-30T10:50:28  <UncleVasya> mcstar:  hah, it is definitely a Destiny. Look at the 7th topic ( starting from the top): http://queue.acm.org/index.cfm
2011-12-30T10:51:41  <ahow984_> UncleVasya: are you competint in that?
2011-12-30T10:52:00  <UncleVasya> no, just curious a little
2011-12-30T10:52:12  <ahow984_> why not compete?
2011-12-30T10:53:43  <UncleVasya> 1. will have no time for this; 2. seems hard to me.
2011-12-30T10:53:52  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i started reading it, and i realized its a long article
2011-12-30T10:54:25  <mcstar> ill give it a full read later
2011-12-30T10:54:28  <ahow984_> UncleVasya: no harm in trying, I doubt I'll be able to do it but there's no harm in trying :P
2011-12-30T10:54:34  <ahow984_> mcstar: are you going to do it?
2011-12-30T10:54:40  <mcstar> yes
2011-12-30T10:54:44  <mcstar> definitely
2011-12-30T10:54:57  <ahow984_> have you seen any more details apart from the homepage?
2011-12-30T10:54:58  <mcstar> seems to be an interesting article, with hands-on experience
2011-12-30T10:55:29  <mcstar> you dont know me yet, but this is part of my joke
2011-12-30T10:55:38  <mcstar> you talk about the challenge but im talking about the article
2011-12-30T10:55:51  <ahow984_> :P my bad
2011-12-30T10:56:09  <mcstar> theres little detail wrt the contest
2011-12-30T10:56:25  <mcstar> and Ants left me dead

2011-12-30T10:56:35  <ahow984_> if anyone is interested in it
2011-12-30T10:56:35  <mcstar> so no, im not going for it
2011-12-30T10:56:39  <ahow984_> kk
2011-12-30T10:58:05  <mcstar> im solidifying my c++ knowledge atm, to pass the tests
2011-12-30T10:58:15  <ahow984_> tests? In school?
2011-12-30T10:58:33  <ahow984_> did you not make your bot in C++?
2011-12-30T10:58:56  <UncleVasya> mcstar: I found a cool sentence about 'OCaml vs Haskell':
2011-12-30T10:59:05  <UncleVasya> 'A complete commitment to immutability is a commitment to never building anything real.'
2011-12-30T11:00:09  <UncleVasya> ahow984_: he did it in Lisp, then in something else, then in c++ and finally in C++11 :)
2011-12-30T11:00:32  <mcstar> there was no something else inbetween
2011-12-30T11:00:44  <UncleVasya> This time many guys decided to write their submissions in Lisp :D
2011-12-30T11:01:29  <UncleVasya> ahow984_:  I'll give you a A mark in history if you tell me why :D
2011-12-30T11:01:29  <mcstar> ahow984_: job interview/tests, i wrote it in c++, but that doesnt mean i know the details of its object oriented features
2011-12-30T11:02:24  <ahow984_> UncleVasya: if I tell you why what? :P

2011-12-30T11:03:17  <UncleVasya> GreenTead too, btw.
2011-12-30T11:03:22  <ahow984_> because Lisp is excellent at representing mathematical algorithims
2011-12-30T11:03:23  <mcstar> oh?
2011-12-30T11:03:34  <mcstar> ahow984_: your out
2011-12-30T11:03:41  <ahow984_> and historically it has always been used for AI
2011-12-30T11:03:48  <mcstar> wrong still
2011-12-30T11:03:50  <ahow984_> :P whats the answer?
2011-12-30T11:04:05  <mcstar> third try for a D?
2011-12-30T11:04:10  <UncleVasya> But he changed it back to Java after few weeks.
2011-12-30T11:04:24  <ahow984_> amm, because Lisp makes you sound smart? lol I dunno
2011-12-30T11:04:40  <ahow984_> what I have said is true though (point 1 and 2)
2011-12-30T11:04:51  <UncleVasya> In his blog he said he steped back to Java because Lisp was very slow for him.
2011-12-30T11:05:06  <mcstar> speed was ok for me
2011-12-30T11:05:13  <mcstar> i profiled and optimized
2011-12-30T11:05:17  <ahow984_> oh, ok
2011-12-30T11:05:22  <mcstar> (meaning, i declared some types)
2011-12-30T11:05:27  <ahow984_> I thought the question was why they chose Lisp in the first place
2011-12-30T11:05:32  <mcstar> yes
2011-12-30T11:05:37  <mcstar> and you still dont know the answer
2011-12-30T11:05:46  <ahow984_> no-one has answered me yet ;)

2011-12-30T11:07:55  <ahow984_> because some guy won it with Lisp?

2011-12-30T11:50:02  <ahow984_> is there much point in trying to predict opponents actions in a continuious game?
2011-12-30T11:50:26  <pairofdice> Of course
2011-12-30T11:50:42  <ahow984_> it would be a lot harder though....
2011-12-30T11:53:11  <mcstar> the consequences of actions can still be discrete and enumerable
2011-12-30T11:53:27  <mcstar> and you can calculate intervals too
2011-12-30T11:54:12  <mcstar> pairofdice: i dont quite follow, what do you mean by exact quote?
2011-12-30T11:54:51  <pairofdice> Exactly that

2011-12-30T11:56:09  <pairofdice> If you say 1234 and quote it as "1234." ?
2011-12-30T11:57:58  <UncleVasya> I think there is no much outcome from this. Because you have a very limited time (both, a time for compute one turn and time for the whole game - number of turns) and no way (imho) you gonna 'understand' patterns in behavior of your opponent.
2011-12-30T11:58:56  <janzert> the rule I was taught, was the punctuation stayed inside the quotes if it was part of the original quote
2011-12-30T11:59:05  <UncleVasya> And even if you figured out some of them right, still there is a chance of changing them by your opponent.
2011-12-30T11:59:28  <janzert> personally I still don't like it and tend to remove it from inside the quote and then add it outside the quote of required by the context
2011-12-30T11:59:36  <janzert> of -> if
2011-12-30T11:59:41  <UncleVasya> Like guys had a context-related score function for battle resolution in ants.
2011-12-30T12:00:03  <mcstar> janzert: i can agree with that, but a lot of times that i see that, they are not actual quotes
2011-12-30T12:00:13  <mcstar> let me explain
2011-12-30T12:00:42  <mcstar> they are trying to give emphasis to something
2011-12-30T12:01:03  <mcstar> or a not-quite-precise explanation
2011-12-30T12:01:15  <mcstar> like this example:
2011-12-30T12:01:26  <mcstar> in the ‚Äúsolution space,‚Äù which is the place where you‚Äôre modeling that problem
2011-12-30T12:01:33  <janzert> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes
2011-12-30T12:02:03  <janzert> ahh, I haven't noticed punctuation handling around those
2011-12-30T12:02:38  <mcstar> thanks for the article i meant exactly that
2011-12-30T12:04:11  <mcstar> janzert: i would prefer arch simply because its more up to date than ubuntu, whats your opinion?
2011-12-30T12:04:55  <mcstar> there were some complaints regarding the haskell platform version in this contest for example
2011-12-30T12:05:21  <UncleVasya> ahow984_: there was a little conversation about opponent prediction in Planet Wars (past challenge) on Russian chess programming forum. The outcome of the conversation was that prediction cannot be applied succesfully in one game. And one'd better assume that opponent will always make smart moves.

2011-12-30T12:08:08  <UncleVasya> mcstar: lol, janzert doesnt't even be in one room with those who propose Arch :D
2011-12-30T12:08:10  <janzert> stupid irc client :?
2011-12-30T12:08:22  <UncleVasya> *doesn't even want
2011-12-30T12:09:26  <janzert> anyway... the haskell platform in ants was an unfortunate situation where the ubuntu version we were using was broken and no one stepped up to provide an alternative build method before the contest started
2011-12-30T12:09:59  <janzert> I would postulate that this would actually be a more frequent occurrence under a distribution like arch
2011-12-30T12:10:52  * mcstar has a whole big bag of disagreement with that postulation
2011-12-30T12:10:53  <janzert> also I'd rather not use a distribution that uses source packages primarily as we do a lot of reinstalling and install time is actually a bit important
2011-12-30T12:11:11  <mcstar> what?
2011-12-30T12:11:22  <janzert> Also in particular I don't like arch's handling of python versions ;)
2011-12-30T12:13:02  <mcstar> anyway, i dont get that "that uses source packages primarily" part
2011-12-30T12:13:19  <mcstar> i only installed from sources when i wanted for some odd reason
2011-12-30T12:13:40  <mcstar> and abs is very handy and easy to use
2011-12-30T12:14:18  <janzert> ahh, I may misunderstand that then. I thought one of the advocates of arch main points was that packages were built from source at install for the specific environment being installed into
2011-12-30T12:14:28  <mcstar> no
2011-12-30T12:14:40  <mcstar> its binary for i686 and x86_64
2011-12-30T12:14:45  <mcstar> and theres a ppc fork
2011-12-30T12:15:25  <pairofdice> Gentoo is great fun, learned a lot about linux installing that...
2011-12-30T12:15:25  <janzert> ok, so one less strike against ;)
2011-12-30T12:16:21  <mcstar> one of its strong point is the package manager and package hierarch
2011-12-30T12:16:23  <mcstar> y
2011-12-30T12:16:27  <mcstar> it is very sane and usable
2011-12-30T12:16:48  <mcstar> you should at least give it a testdrive
2011-12-30T12:17:31  <mcstar> your 3rd point is valid, but its also personal
2011-12-30T12:18:07  <mcstar> as i am not familiar with other distros any longer, could you tell me how is it done?
2011-12-30T12:18:12  <janzert> and why should I think they don't make the same bad decisions for every other package ;)
2011-12-30T12:18:21  <mcstar> python is python2.7 and python3 is ...
2011-12-30T12:18:23  <mcstar> ?
2011-12-30T12:18:26  <janzert> python3
2011-12-30T12:18:34  <janzert> python is supposed to be latest python2
2011-12-30T12:18:35  <mcstar> ofc
2011-12-30T12:18:43  <mcstar> i just didnt want to repeat python3
2011-12-30T12:18:47  <mcstar> but now i did
2011-12-30T12:19:19  <janzert> http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/
2011-12-30T12:19:27  <mcstar> maybe the packagers thought that the transition will be faster to python3 than it is
2011-12-30T12:19:59  <mcstar> python should refer to the same target as python2 but may refer to python3 on some bleeding edge distributions
2011-12-30T12:20:17  <mcstar> so its a guide line
2011-12-30T12:20:28  <janzert> admittedly that pep was mostly a reaction to get official preference out after arch changed
2011-12-30T12:20:43  <mcstar> ok, all im saying, is that you try to give arch a try if you have time
2011-12-30T12:20:53  <janzert> ok :)

2011-12-30T16:19:24  <ahow984_> did you get my link for ICPC earlier?
2011-12-30T16:25:21  <cseyu01> nope
2011-12-30T16:25:36  <cseyu01> 2012 contest?
2011-12-30T16:25:40  <ahow984_> http://cm.baylor.edu/challenge/
2011-12-30T16:25:50  <ahow984_> I dunno tbh
2011-12-30T16:25:58  <cseyu01> I've seen this
2011-12-30T16:25:59  <ahow984_> its so confusing :/
2011-12-30T16:26:02  <ahow984_> oh
2011-12-30T16:26:07  <cseyu01> looks fun but i think it's over
2011-12-30T16:26:23  <ahow984_> so when will there be details for the 2012 one?
2011-12-30T16:26:37  <cseyu01> it shows the tournament image, already filled in
2011-12-30T16:26:48  <cseyu01> i dunnno, i hope soon :)
2011-12-30T16:26:53  <cseyu01> i like this stuff
2011-12-30T16:26:55  <ahow984_> yeah, same :)
2011-12-30T16:27:12  <cseyu01> i found out about this dec 5th tho :(
2011-12-30T16:27:17  <ahow984_> I think it'll be too difficult for me but at the least I'll just mess around with the starter bot
2011-12-30T16:27:29  <cseyu01> others worked on it since october
2011-12-30T16:28:13  <ahow984_> aichallenge.org?
2011-12-30T16:28:20  <cseyu01> ya
2011-12-30T16:28:25  <ahow984_> theres always the next one :)
2011-12-30T16:28:30  <cseyu01> I'm still working on my bot tho
2011-12-30T16:28:31  <cseyu01> http://tcpants.com/player/MettaWorldPeace_004
2011-12-30T16:28:39  <cseyu01> alot of bugs
2011-12-30T16:29:01  <cseyu01> worked ok locally, but finding little logic and off bby 1 type errors everywhere
2011-12-30T16:29:04  <ahow984_> yes, a lot of ants ;)
2011-12-30T16:29:18  <cseyu01> locally i had 1000ms
2011-12-30T16:29:31  <cseyu01> tcpants.com uses 500
2011-12-30T16:29:46  <ahow984_> yeah
2011-12-30T16:29:48  <ahow984_> pity
2011-12-30T16:30:02  <cseyu01> I allocate the first 200 ms and last 200ms for maintenance and map building
2011-12-30T16:30:08  <ahow984_> ah well, how did you place overall?
2011-12-30T16:30:18  <cseyu01> so instead of 600ms for moves i get 100
2011-12-30T16:30:27  <cseyu01> alot of adjustments needed
2011-12-30T16:30:55  <cseyu01> optimizing and cutting out unnessesary things
2011-12-30T16:31:21  <cseyu01> i think ppl using c++ have a timing edge
2011-12-30T16:31:31  <ahow984_> me :)
2011-12-30T16:31:34  <cseyu01> python may be a little slow
2011-12-30T16:31:44  <ahow984_> Java would be a lot worse though lol
2011-12-30T16:32:03  <ahow984_> I didn't have one timeout in any of my codes
2011-12-30T16:32:13  <ahow984_> all the way along with my tests, no timeout :)
2011-12-30T16:32:15  <UncleVasya> cseyu01: you can contact the owner of tcp-ants and ask him to increase the time limit.
2011-12-30T16:32:36  <cseyu01> I don't mind the challenge
2011-12-30T16:32:58  <cseyu01> things should've been done optimally in the 1st place
2011-12-30T16:33:10  <cseyu01> we need more bots on there tho
2011-12-30T16:33:30  <ahow984_> cseyu01: where did you come overall?
2011-12-30T16:33:41  <cseyu01> lefant is the only one who leaves his running 24/7
2011-12-30T16:33:52  <cseyu01> just under 600th
2011-12-30T16:33:55  <UncleVasya> Since it has a little number of people now who just ant to play around with ants, I think he will accept it for the comfort of users.
2011-12-30T16:34:21  <ahow984_> a lot better then me :P I was > 1000th :/
2011-12-30T16:34:23  <cseyu01> but old program was far from my best
