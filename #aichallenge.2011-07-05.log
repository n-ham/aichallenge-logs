2011-07-05T06:50:38  <mcstar> aerique: hi, are you available?
2011-07-05T06:54:15  <mcstar> @later tell aerique is the fasl only architecture dependent? im wondering if i could just upload a fasl, with a script to load and die, so that i wouldn have to mess with asdf on the server? what do you think?
2011-07-05T06:54:15  <contestbot> mcstar: Job's done.
2011-07-05T06:59:18  <mcstar> ok, should have checked first the manual: only compatible with the exact version the fasl was produced with

2011-07-05T07:01:37  <mcstar> antimatroid: whom should i ask about package versions in the server?
2011-07-05T07:01:45  <antimatroid> no idea
2011-07-05T07:01:57  <antimatroid> :)
2011-07-05T07:02:03  <antimatroid> amstan maybe?
2011-07-05T07:02:06  <mcstar> better than no answer
2011-07-05T07:02:16  <mcstar> hey, how are with the cleaning up?
2011-07-05T07:02:24  <mcstar> or where are you..
2011-07-05T07:05:32  <antimatroid> being lazy :P
2011-07-05T07:05:46  <antimatroid> cleaning up isn't fun :P
2011-07-05T07:07:08  <mcstar> i packaged and class-ified it its now 180 lines
2011-07-05T07:07:14  <mcstar> i can put it in my bot now
2011-07-05T07:07:49  <mcstar> but i still have to change a couple of things in my bot to make it path-aware, rather than ants based
2011-07-05T07:09:29  <aerique> mcstar: you could try running the same OS as the server in a VM and use that to produce the fasl
2011-07-05T07:10:01  <mcstar> aerique: i just downloaded the natty sbcl, ill see if i can run it to compile my fasl
2011-07-05T07:11:39  <aerique> mcstar: amstan's probably the man, or mcleo
2011-07-05T07:12:18  <aerique> mcstar: i might still have shell access to the beta server but i don't know if it's running the same setup as the official server will
2011-07-05T07:12:26  <mcstar> yeah, but neither is here atm. i remember people saying its ubuntu natty, but im not sure if its true in the first place
2011-07-05T07:12:58  <aerique> in the beginning it was 10.0x (maverick?) but lately i'm hearing natty as well
2011-07-05T07:13:00  <mcstar> that doesnt matter, if it works with beta, i can make it work with the production system
2011-07-05T07:13:11  <aerique> the wiki docs are out of sync on that matter as well
2011-07-05T07:16:02  <aerique> mcstar: why's asdf on the server a problem anyway?
2011-07-05T07:16:50  <mcstar> i use .config/common-lisp
2011-07-05T07:16:59  <mcstar> and i dont like messing with *central-registry*
2011-07-05T07:17:15  <mcstar> i know, im lame :)
2011-07-05T07:17:50  <mcstar> oh, and with the fasl, no one can know what the source was in the first place
2011-07-05T07:18:01  <mcstar> (at least not on that level)

2011-07-05T14:06:48  <eashoka> gobang : yea :-) actually, this has happened to me several times in the past. It also used to display a very old version line instead of the immediate past version, and then started to drop ghost lines altogether. any admins reading, please note. Oh well, may be you already have this in the bug data base... chill out in that case :-)
2011-07-05T14:08:22  <gobang> oh, i'm not one of the organizers, just playing around here, like you
2011-07-05T14:10:41  <eashoka> gobang : I know mate, was posting to organizers. BTW, saw you have updated as well. it gives a ghost line for everybody except me :-(
2011-07-05T14:11:39  <eashoka> anyway, this ghost thing is a cool feature they have some up with :-)
2011-07-05T14:19:13  <gobang> eashoka, seems, you don't need a ghost at all ;) (back at 40)
2011-07-05T14:21:49  <eashoka> gobang: yeah the server is quick today. normally it takes time, anyway coming back to first 40 is quick. going the next 20 is the hard bit. took me 60 games last time :-(

2011-07-05T17:23:00  <mcstar> hell i forgot, amstan what is the exact version of sbcl on the beta server?
2011-07-05T17:23:38  <amstan> the main server has SBCL 1.0.45.0.debian
2011-07-05T17:23:43  <amstan> the worker should be the same
2011-07-05T17:23:53  <mcstar> thx

2011-07-05T17:46:20  <jmcarthur> mcstar: btw, the llvm back end helped performance of all the versions of sqrt about equally, fyi
2011-07-05T17:47:12  <mcstar> jmcarthur: so how close are they to the stock sqrt?
2011-07-05T17:47:51  <jmcarthur> mcstar: the primop is in the range of 5-8 times faster
2011-07-05T17:48:44  <jmcarthur> probably says more about the primop than it does about the recursive versions
2011-07-05T17:49:04  <mcstar> well, iterative rather, no?
2011-07-05T17:49:13  <jmcarthur> sure, by the time it's compiled down
2011-07-05T17:50:01  <mcstar> im really interested in haskell, i was considering before i started coding for the contest, and decided to learn lisp instead, i think i made a good choice
2011-07-05T17:50:08  <mcstar> but i wont give up on haskell
2011-07-05T17:50:23  <mcstar> but i fear it takes very much time to understand it

2011-07-05T17:51:05  <jmcarthur> that's a problem if you need to get something working fast
2011-07-05T17:51:17  <jmcarthur> it's not a problem if you have the time and are doing it for fun
2011-07-05T17:51:34  <jmcarthur> but i agree, there is a steeper learning curve compared to other languages
2011-07-05T17:51:42  <jmcarthur> at least initially
