2011-02-15T03:25:09  <antimatroid> what year?
2011-02-15T03:25:24  <pyro-> starting 3rd
2011-02-15T03:25:31  <pyro-> of 5
2011-02-15T03:25:50  <antimatroid> my undergrad was 4, this will be my 5th (honours)
2011-02-15T03:26:20  <antimatroid> i did 39 units in those 4 years though to cover 3 majors :\ so close to 5 years worth
2011-02-15T03:26:36  <pyro-> after 5 i'll prolly have to do some work experience stuff as well before im done
2011-02-15T03:27:03  <pyro-> cant remmeber how it works exactly but you cant qualify as professional engineer until youve done a few months under another one

2011-02-15T03:27:32  <antimatroid> :)

2011-02-15T03:27:58  <pyro-> and its only going to get worse as i try to make the maps more cool
2011-02-15T03:28:25  <pyro-> accreditation is bad
2011-02-15T03:28:49  <antimatroid> larger maps with more smaller rectangles and you're onto a winer i think

2011-02-15T06:22:43  <delt0r___> antimatroid: you can't avoid rounding errors, but you can have consistent rounding.
2011-02-15T06:23:00  <delt0r___> in particular sqrt is not like sin and cos etc
2011-02-15T06:23:13  <delt0r___> just about every implementation is 2 ulp
2011-02-15T06:23:40  <delt0r___> so it should work across langs and compile options...
2011-02-15T06:23:45  <delt0r___> But generally rounding errors don't do that...
2011-02-15T06:24:41  <delt0r___> its most noticeable with trig functions...

2011-02-15T11:37:11  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: IMO, the best kind of haskell code for a beginner is idiomatic, taking advantage of the type system and the best libraries to write clear concise code. it may take longer for a beginner to understand, but it's *much* less time to start messing with it. tighter types, as you tend to get with specialized libraries, typically make the space of valid code much more traversable. i'm not
2011-02-15T11:37:13  <jmcarthur> even sure that there *is* any meaning for "beginner-friendly" in haskell
2011-02-15T11:38:14  <jmcarthur> after all, if "beginner-friendly" just means writing more imperative code, that means more monadic code, and we know how much that (irrationally) scares beginners...

2011-02-15T20:44:50  <McLeopold> so, I'm thinking that I want to stick with the input being changes only
2011-02-15T20:45:25  <McLeopold> and that means sticking with col, row
2011-02-15T20:45:47  <antimatroid1> why does that mean col,row?
2011-02-15T20:45:51  <antimatroid1> and why changes only?
2011-02-15T20:46:15  <antimatroid1> i think people updating information is complicated enough already without having to work out what information is only implicitly revealed to them
2011-02-15T20:46:59  <McLeopold> dude, clear the lists, recreate, it is *not* complicated
2011-02-15T20:47:00  <Prillicy> does updating somehow make the code less complex? Honestly it sounds notably more complicated
2011-02-15T20:47:02  <antimatroid1> i've pretty much decided if that does happen, i'll be constructing my own char map to then get info from anyway, otherwise it's just ridiciulously complicated and messy
2011-02-15T20:47:19  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: the point is you want to use information from the previous turns
2011-02-15T20:47:33  <McLeopold> that is a bot issue, not an engine issue
2011-02-15T20:48:02  <antimatroid1> i consider it unideal for the engine to pass information implicitly, particularly when it makes things significantly messier for everyone
2011-02-15T20:48:46  <antimatroid1> either way, that's just my opinion :)
2011-02-15T20:49:15  <McLeopold> I will consider passing land entries then
2011-02-15T20:49:48  <Prillicy> there's also a heavy risk of errors going unnoticed by the engine
2011-02-15T20:50:05  <McLeopold> what type of errors?
2011-02-15T20:50:38  <Prillicy> you won't be able to monitor errors if you don't know what you were working with the previous turn
2011-02-15T20:50:57  <Prillicy> and if the engine isn't monitoring what is happening, then it can't know
2011-02-15T20:51:02  <antimatroid1> yes you will, i write the state to a file every turn when debugging
2011-02-15T20:51:25  <McLeopold> engine errors or bot errors?
2011-02-15T20:51:30  <Prillicy> so then if the entire game is being built out, how is it easier to only pass changes?
2011-02-15T20:51:45  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: pass me land squares and i'm happy, but i don't think input will be any smaller then
2011-02-15T20:52:11  <McLeopold> Okay, I will put in land squares and recalc the average size of input.
2011-02-15T20:52:20  <antimatroid1> have you fixed the fog of war?
2011-02-15T20:52:21  <McLeopold> But so far, it is *way* smaller.
2011-02-15T20:52:22  <Prillicy> let's say your engine makes a mistake and places food on water, or worse, an ant
2011-02-15T20:52:51  <antimatroid1> Prillicy: storing old wall information is not complicated for either option
2011-02-15T20:53:08  <McLeopold> The engine will be perfect. :)
2011-02-15T20:53:28  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: yes, but I'm not sure if I put it on github yet.
2011-02-15T20:53:30  <Prillicy> except if you're storing it, then you have to build it anyway, so why avoid using it?
2011-02-15T20:53:39  <antimatroid1> i haven't been running your engine anyway
2011-02-15T20:54:01  <McLeopold> well, no one is, so, who cares if I fixed it?
2011-02-15T20:54:21  <McLeopold> I wrote the java bots today.
2011-02-15T20:54:31  <antimatroid1> nice
2011-02-15T20:54:33  <McLeopold> I may write a java engine as well.
2011-02-15T20:54:40  <Prillicy> geez
2011-02-15T20:54:44  <McLeopold> I not sure if it will be any faster.
2011-02-15T20:54:53  <McLeopold> java is always so class heavy.
2011-02-15T20:55:02  <antimatroid1> i'll see if i can't get io from processes working faster in c++ later
2011-02-15T20:55:24  <McLeopold> Most people will appreciate the java engine anyway
2011-02-15T20:55:47  <McLeopold> Prillicy: what languages do you use?
2011-02-15T20:55:54  <antimatroid1> yeah, but the server should possiby have whatever runs fastest
2011-02-15T20:56:00  <antimatroid1> to maximise games
2011-02-15T20:56:27  <Prillicy> the list is on the website
2011-02-15T20:58:04  <Prillicy> now, many of these are used for the same purpose, but I don't like to be incomplete

2011-02-15T20:58:47  <Prillicy> I usually use c# because it's what I use at work
2011-02-15T21:01:38  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: can I see you engine code?
2011-02-15T21:02:05  <Prillicy> why ask if you don't care
2011-02-15T21:02:07  <McLeopold> actually, amstan should put you on the committers list
2011-02-15T21:02:09  <Prillicy> you suck!
2011-02-15T21:02:25  <McLeopold> because you listed php ;)
2011-02-15T21:03:24  <Prillicy> you know you're message boards are in php right?
2011-02-15T21:03:40  <Prillicy> and that the anti-spam mod you're using I built (by the way, I"m about to release a new version)

2011-02-15T21:40:46  <flag> I'm just reading the debate with transmitting the entire map vs. updates, and I just want to point out that if you guys wanted to play with those 1000x1000 maps you'd be trasmitting 1MBps per user on the tcp server
2011-02-15T21:41:14  <flag> The planetwars server had upwards of 40 - 50 people playing at once.
2011-02-15T21:41:53  <flag> So you'd either need extremely fast connections, or extremely slow games
2011-02-15T21:42:35  <flag> the 1MBps per user is of course assuming 1 second moves too
2011-02-15T21:42:53  <flag> but there's also protocol overhead... I doubt it's practical
2011-02-15T21:43:05  <antimatroid> 1000x1000 maps are too large
2011-02-15T21:43:16  <antimatroid> i think 200x200 might be close to the upper bound of what's realistic
2011-02-15T21:43:17  <flag> wasn't that what you guys were considering?
2011-02-15T21:44:40  <antimatroid> not i
2011-02-15T21:44:53  <flag> I swear I read that somewhere
2011-02-15T21:44:57  <antimatroid> ideally you want most games to end not from the turn limit, which would need to be insanely high with 1000x1000
2011-02-15T21:45:06  <antimatroid> add that to the data per move, i just don't think it's realistic
2011-02-15T21:45:39  <flag> I don't think it's realisitc either honestly, but anyway

2011-02-15T21:48:39  <Prillicy> therefore bigger is awesomer
2011-02-15T21:57:38  <jbroman> flag: If we made 1000x1000 maps, surely we would take the trivial step of running the network protocol over zlib?
2011-02-15T22:00:25  <Prillicy> I was thinking you should build more gifs ;)
2011-02-15T22:00:50  <jbroman> ("##########" compresses very well.)
2011-02-15T22:01:55  <flag> I suppose we could do that
2011-02-15T22:02:44  <flag> I'm not sure whether or not it would compress 10x, or how ever much it would need to be compressed in order to be practical
2011-02-15T22:03:05  <flag> And it's still not practical simply because of how many turns the games would take to resolve
2011-02-15T22:03:24  <jbroman> flag: It would compress far, far, far better than 10x.
2011-02-15T22:04:00  <jbroman> Seeing as you'd likely have repeated instances of things like "50 empty spaces in a row" get compressed down to a single byte.
2011-02-15T22:04:31  <flag> Yeah, you're right
2011-02-15T22:04:40  <flag> I think I know where I got the 1000x1000 thing from though
2011-02-15T22:05:00  <flag> I think the discussion was on 200x200 and 1000 moves total, not 1000x1000 maps

2011-02-15T22:06:04  *** SheV0 <SheV0!~chatzilla@97.104.19.221> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-15T22:06:21  <Prillicy> I was just waiting for that
2011-02-15T22:06:25  <Prillicy> ;math 200*200
2011-02-15T22:06:26  <SheV0> 200*200=40000
2011-02-15T22:06:43  <Prillicy> that seems like a more reasonable number of moves
2011-02-15T22:07:06  <Prillicy> you must account for the number of times people can push forward and be beaten back
2011-02-15T22:07:29  <jbroman> Prillicy: What seems like a reasonable number of moves? 1000 or 40,000?
2011-02-15T22:07:34  <Prillicy> the only logical reason to restrict the moves would be if you had a limited number of food items on the map
2011-02-15T22:07:38  <jbroman> 40,000 would mean that each game would take days to complete.
2011-02-15T22:07:39  <Prillicy> 40k
2011-02-15T22:07:48  <Prillicy> days?
2011-02-15T22:07:50  <Prillicy> are you kidding me
2011-02-15T22:07:54  <Prillicy> bull crap
2011-02-15T22:07:56  <jbroman> Prillicy: We allow 1 second per player per turn, assume 2 turns. 80,000 seconds is almost 24 hours.
2011-02-15T22:08:01  <jbroman> 86400 seconds/day
2011-02-15T22:08:09  <jbroman> s/2 turns/2 players/
2011-02-15T22:08:20  <Prillicy> incorrect
2011-02-15T22:08:27  <Prillicy> players moves are simultaneous
2011-02-15T22:08:37  <flag> that's beside the point
2011-02-15T22:08:43  <Prillicy> that cuts your time in half
2011-02-15T22:08:45  <flag> it's still a rediculous amount of time
2011-02-15T22:08:47  <jbroman> Prillicy: Even if they are simultaneous, 11 hours/game is still ridiculous.
2011-02-15T22:08:51  <Prillicy> and that also assumes 1 second per move
2011-02-15T22:08:58  <flag> games from past contests were minutes long
2011-02-15T22:09:01  <Prillicy> which is what it might take to run, not what it would take to display
2011-02-15T22:09:04  <jbroman> Prillicy: Many players will use the full time.
2011-02-15T22:09:13  <antimatroid> i'm thinking time limit will be 2-3 seconds
2011-02-15T22:09:31  <flag> the point is what it takes to run, because 100s of games will be run for every bot
2011-02-15T22:09:46  <flag> display time is meaningless
2011-02-15T22:10:55  <Prillicy> you're going to have a lot of games that end incomplete and the winners will often be determined incorrectly
2011-02-15T22:11:20  <jbroman> Prillicy: Even allowing 5% of games to take half a day each is absurd.
2011-02-15T22:11:41  <antimatroid> i think more bots will use their time for this than planet wars
2011-02-15T22:11:55  <antimatroid> you very much need to do something tree like for fighting bots with this
2011-02-15T22:12:02  <antimatroid> well, i think you do
2011-02-15T22:12:32  <flag> are battles being resolved with option 1 or 2?
2011-02-15T22:13:19  <flag> or is it undecided?
2011-02-15T22:14:28  <antimatroid> undecided
2011-02-15T22:14:48  <antimatroid> i'd almost be keen to just work on option 1 anyway if option 2 is used
2011-02-15T22:14:52  <antimatroid> it's way more interesting
2011-02-15T22:16:11  <flag> I have a feeling it would just end up confusing everyone
2011-02-15T22:16:34  <flag> option 2 is more intuitive
2011-02-15T22:18:45  <antimatroid> i don't think 2 is more inuitive
2011-02-15T22:18:55  <antimatroid> it's more costly to calculate, and the results are far less intuitive
2011-02-15T22:25:44  <flag> wouldn't option 1 end
2011-02-15T22:26:34  <flag> with senerios where 2 ants meating 1 enemy ant only leaves the 1 enemy ant dieing, as oppose to one of each dieing?
2011-02-15T22:27:03  <flag> or 3 ants meeting 2 ants and only the 2 enemy ants dieing?
2011-02-15T22:28:46  <jbroman> flag: Yes, such scenarios are possible with that option. This is one of the reasons Jeff objects to it. And one of the reasons its proponents favour it. It allows bots which know how to leverage it to advance significantly.
2011-02-15T22:29:56  <antimatroid> it's not reasonable to have 2 enemy ants in range of 1 and have 1 die from both side
2011-02-15T22:30:37  <flag> it's not reasonable to assume that the 2 ants take no damage either, or 3 ants don't take damage from 2 ants
2011-02-15T22:30:45  <antimatroid> you either need to have ant ids and kill the earliest made or pick one with some stupid rule that would suck
2011-02-15T22:30:46  <Prillicy> I think I misinterpretted option 1
2011-02-15T22:31:05  <antimatroid> Prillicy: are you reading the specs page or forums?
2011-02-15T22:31:17  <antimatroid> i think the maths explanation on the specs page is clearest
2011-02-15T22:31:19  <Prillicy> no
2011-02-15T22:31:47  <antimatroid> ... ?
2011-02-15T22:31:52  <Prillicy> I thought option 1 was 1 to 1 exchange, always ant for ant
2011-02-15T22:31:53  <antimatroid> it wasn't really a yes or no question :P
2011-02-15T22:32:01  <antimatroid> no, none of the options do that
2011-02-15T22:32:11  <Prillicy> Prillicy: are you reading the specs page or forums? <---yes or no
2011-02-15T22:32:22  <antimatroid> option 2 encourages you to have less ants fighting more neighbours, option 1 encourages more ants fighting less neighbours
2011-02-15T22:32:24  <Prillicy> I present option 3 then
2011-02-15T22:32:39  <jbroman> Prillicy: The obvious problem with 1:1 elimination is this case: ABC. Who dies?
2011-02-15T22:32:49  <jbroman> Or ABA.
2011-02-15T22:33:31  <antimatroid> jborman: or the fact that there's no strategy for it
2011-02-15T22:33:37  <Prillicy> 1st, if they all attack, then 2 will die actually, and in 2, if they all attack, then all 3 because you killed yourself
2011-02-15T22:33:41  <pyro-> health + only ants that walk into each other fight solves all?
2011-02-15T22:33:45  <Prillicy> remember
2011-02-15T22:33:48  <Prillicy> abc is not an attack
2011-02-15T22:33:56  <flag> Actually, I take it back, I like option 1
2011-02-15T22:34:04  <Prillicy> when a moves to b, and c moves to b, then all 3 die
2011-02-15T22:34:14  <Prillicy> unless b moves to c
2011-02-15T22:34:18  <antimatroid> Prillicy: hold up, i'm lost
2011-02-15T22:34:20  <Prillicy> then a & c die and b survives
2011-02-15T22:34:30  <jbroman> Prillicy: If I'm not mistaken, fight radius > 0.
2011-02-15T22:34:41  <flag> read the spec Prillicy
2011-02-15T22:35:07  <antimatroid> yeah, i would ideally like the fight radius to be >=2 so enemies can't collide
2011-02-15T22:35:23  <Prillicy> I think you guys are overcomplicating something simple
2011-02-15T22:35:46  <pyro-> Prillicy: correct
2011-02-15T22:35:52  <antimatroid> how?
2011-02-15T22:35:58  <flag> What do you suggest then?
2011-02-15T22:36:10  <antimatroid> it's really boring if death is just by colliding ants
2011-02-15T22:36:23  <Prillicy> boring?
2011-02-15T22:36:36  <jbroman> Prillicy: If turns are simultaneous and ants only fight when they occupy the same space, it's possible for ants to swap places. AB <-> BA.
2011-02-15T22:36:38  <Prillicy> do you have any idea the number of strategies necessary to coordinate an army of ants
2011-02-15T22:36:46  <Prillicy> jbroman: correct
2011-02-15T22:36:51  <antimatroid> jbroman: you can already do that with friend ants
2011-02-15T22:36:53  <Prillicy> thus creating strategic ways out of fights
2011-02-15T22:37:03  <jbroman> antimatroid: Yeah, but it's weirder with enemies.
2011-02-15T22:37:11  <Prillicy> and the possibility of accidentally killing your own ants if you're stupid
2011-02-15T22:37:30  <antimatroid> Prillicy: "size" of the cartesian product of their non-wall adjacent squares with nothing less collisions
2011-02-15T22:37:38  <antimatroid> i know it's huge
2011-02-15T22:37:44  <antimatroid> but it's boring micro strategy wise
2011-02-15T22:38:02  <Prillicy> think about a funnel in the map
2011-02-15T22:38:18  <Prillicy> where there's one line of movable squares between you and the enemy
2011-02-15T22:38:32  <Prillicy> an enemy unprepared for this, could be wiping out his entire force coming after you

2011-02-15T22:39:05  <Prillicy> apparently I was mistaken about option 1, I am in favor of option 3 and have been since day one
2011-02-15T22:39:15  <antimatroid> have you read the specs page and looked at hte examples on the forums?
2011-02-15T22:39:24  <Prillicy> I already said no

2011-02-15T22:40:53  <antimatroid> we threw out that third option because it allowed for blocking of arbitrary width corridors
2011-02-15T22:42:10  <antimatroid> flag: what made you change your mind?
2011-02-15T22:43:45  <flag> There's no obvious way decide which ant dies in the second method in some situations
2011-02-15T22:44:46  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-02-15T22:44:57  <flag> Or perhaps I'm reading it incorrectly
2011-02-15T22:45:13  <flag> In the second method, 2 vs 1 results in a death on both sides, correct?
2011-02-15T22:45:17  <antimatroid> it's not always possible to correctly resolve option 2 with the fog of war, but it should always be possible to work out which ants die with all info
2011-02-15T22:45:26  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-15T22:45:33  <flag> Which of the 2 ants die?
2011-02-15T22:45:46  <antimatroid> oh sorry, a b a would have all three ants die
2011-02-15T22:45:55  <flag> oh
2011-02-15T22:46:07  <antimatroid> you basically go through and remove all enemies 1 distance appart, then rt2 distance apart, etc.
2011-02-15T22:46:20  <antimatroid> look at the images in the forum again

2011-02-15T22:46:53  <jbroman> (at least in FF4, the forum page clips the image)
2011-02-15T22:47:20  <Prillicy> yuck
2011-02-15T22:47:22  <flag> I've only read the spec, so the wording was a bit ambiguous
2011-02-15T22:47:23  <Prillicy> I like the input
2011-02-15T22:47:25  <Prillicy> but yuck
2011-02-15T22:48:13  <Prillicy> let me clarify
2011-02-15T22:48:30  <Prillicy> yes, if you sacrifice ants, you can block corridors
2011-02-15T22:48:42  <Prillicy> but this means you're sacrificing ants, presents an alternative strategy
2011-02-15T22:50:35  <antimatroid> option 1 is pretty easy to understand once you get it, fairly easy to program up and not very expensive, particularly compared to option 2
2011-02-15T22:51:02  <Prillicy> option 3 is easier to program, easier to understand, and what most people would expect
2011-02-15T22:51:19  <antimatroid> which option 3?
2011-02-15T22:51:25  <antimatroid> your "all colliding ants die" rule?
2011-02-15T22:51:32  <Prillicy> correct
2011-02-15T22:51:38  <flag> what if someone blocks a corridor?
2011-02-15T22:51:49  <antimatroid> it's basically 1:1 less stupidity
2011-02-15T22:51:49  <Prillicy> you kill the ants
2011-02-15T22:52:05  <Prillicy> not only that, but they're wasting ants blocking, while you're able ot gather resources
2011-02-15T22:52:16  <Prillicy> blocking a corridor is a strategy
2011-02-15T22:52:22  <Prillicy> nothing wrong with strategies
2011-02-15T22:52:48  <antimatroid> i think that'd be boring compared to 1
2011-02-15T22:54:38  <Prillicy> there are a number of flaws with your logic, but the most obvious is: the more you complicate the game, the more it descrourages beginners
2011-02-15T22:55:19  <flag> antimatroid: after looking at the image I'm not entirely sure, care to explain why you prefer option 1?
2011-02-15T23:01:04  <antimatroid> flag: it introduces benefits to good micro (rather than just punishing stupid micro), it encourages  "clumping up" which provides balance to the incentive to "spread" out to maximise visibility and claim replenished food fastest, option 2 just encourages spreading out again, it also encourages cooperation which the others do not, which is surely a point of having an n-player game
2011-02-15T23:01:30  <antimatroid> with option 1 you can work together to eliminate a third enemy, with the others, you want to let the others fight each other without you involved if possible
2011-02-15T23:01:39  <Prillicy> antimatroid: I really really get annoyed when people who don't understand eco try to pretend they do
2011-02-15T23:01:51  <antimatroid> understand eco?
2011-02-15T23:02:25  <Prillicy> unless you're refering to some other "micro" term
2011-02-15T23:02:29  <antimatroid> i have an economics degree :P
2011-02-15T23:02:46  <Prillicy> so do some members of Obama's cabinet
2011-02-15T23:03:03  <flag> micro is strategy on a unit-by-unit basis
2011-02-15T23:03:15  <antimatroid> i wasn't even referring to economics, but whatever :P
2011-02-15T23:04:01  <flag> the thing I don't really like about option 2 is that 1 ant can potentially result in the death of 2 ants
2011-02-15T23:04:02  <antimatroid> i even did a post grad microeconomics unit during undergrad
2011-02-15T23:04:09  <antimatroid> flag: or more
2011-02-15T23:04:16  <flag> or more
2011-02-15T23:04:21  <Prillicy> antimatroid: do not overvalue your degree?
2011-02-15T23:04:22  <antimatroid> but only if the enemy is stupid
2011-02-15T23:04:29  <antimatroid> hence my comment about punishing stupidity with micro
2011-02-15T23:04:43  <antimatroid> Prillicy: what do you mean?
2011-02-15T23:05:10  <Prillicy> I've met too many people who think they're something special because they can follow orders
2011-02-15T23:05:27  <antimatroid> i don't think i'm anything special, and i'm terrible at following orders :P
2011-02-15T23:05:29  <flag> Prillicy, nobodies trying to act special here
2011-02-15T23:05:47  <flag> s/nobodies/nobody's/g
2011-02-15T23:05:49  <Prillicy> it's not that
2011-02-15T23:06:02  <Prillicy> he's not the only one doing that
2011-02-15T23:06:09  <flag> doing what?
2011-02-15T23:06:32  <Prillicy> but I've heard 6 or 7 people mention "that option doesn't allow for good macro/micro" in order to degrade and destroy the possible ways of building this game
2011-02-15T23:06:46  <flag> what don't you like about that argument?
2011-02-15T23:06:52  <antimatroid> micro and macro are used to refer to things other than economics
2011-02-15T23:07:15  <Prillicy> I dare say that the people who are saying it, don't think that way
2011-02-15T23:07:29  <flag> I think they do
2011-02-15T23:07:49  <flag> The micro/macro terminology comes from starcraft doesn't it?
2011-02-15T23:07:57  <antimatroid> my opinions for this game are very much directed towards getting the most interesting game strategy wise
2011-02-15T23:08:19  * antimatroid doesn't play starcraft, i do actually think in short/long term when i say micro/macro with this
2011-02-15T23:08:54  <Prillicy> more than that, that argument implies that there could be any macro involved in game theory
2011-02-15T23:09:17  <antimatroid> there is
2011-02-15T23:09:24  <Prillicy> only in shitty schools
2011-02-15T23:09:42  <antimatroid> shitty schools what?
2011-02-15T23:10:03  <Prillicy> nevermind, I must just being a dick today
2011-02-15T23:10:07  <flag> stop associating the term macro with economics
2011-02-15T23:10:11  <Prillicy> I see I'm coming across rudely
2011-02-15T23:10:16  <flag> macro == long-term strategy
2011-02-15T23:10:21  <antimatroid> mostly not making any sense :P
2011-02-15T23:10:54  <antimatroid> macro encompases things like where to direct ants to fill the back line of fights or to claim different regions etc.
2011-02-15T23:11:23  <antimatroid> you can certainly think about that from a game theory perspective and try to work out who you should go after etc.
2011-02-15T23:11:30  <Prillicy> macro does not mean long term stategy
2011-02-15T23:11:36  <Prillicy> macro means large group strategy
2011-02-15T23:11:41  <antimatroid> it does when i say it for this
2011-02-15T23:11:54  <antimatroid> we're not talking about economics! :P
2011-02-15T23:12:06  <Prillicy> everything is about economics
2011-02-15T23:12:14  <flag> oh ffs
2011-02-15T23:12:15  <antimatroid> now who's feeling special :P
2011-02-15T23:12:17  <Prillicy> you should know that
2011-02-15T23:12:24  <Prillicy> with your degree
2011-02-15T23:12:31  <Prillicy> and I don't have a degree, I'm no one special
2011-02-15T23:12:40  <flag> define:macro in google has the second definition as of "very large in scale or scope or capability"
2011-02-15T23:12:53  <antimatroid> i think mostly anything from the social sciences is game theory, but i don't think everything is economics
2011-02-15T23:13:00  <flag> therefore, macro strategy is strategy that is large in scope
2011-02-15T23:13:01  <antimatroid> physics for example has very little use of economics
2011-02-15T23:13:10  <Prillicy> anyway, like I said, I"m going to shut up 'cause apparently I'm looking to pick a fight and I have no desire to make good people my enemies
2011-02-15T23:14:16  <antimatroid> i would say microeconomics is just game theory especially
2011-02-15T23:14:41  <antimatroid> particularly all the general equilibrium stuff

2011-02-15T23:16:39  <antimatroid> flag: so what about those reasons for preferring option 1?
2011-02-15T23:16:54  <flag> seems reasonable to me
2011-02-15T23:17:31  <antimatroid> i don't think exploiting the rule is anywhere near as easy as some people seem to think for the "leaders" and i think if people program to "get as many players as close to enemies as possible" with a simple strategy, it wouldn't be much different to just not sucking with option 2
2011-02-15T23:18:23  <antimatroid> jeff has had the best concerns about it, that of beginners both being tramples and clear brick walls in the leaderboard
2011-02-15T23:18:50  <antimatroid> if there's certain stages where there's a significant amount of work needed to progress anywhere, a lot of people will hit the wall then give up with frustration
2011-02-15T23:19:09  <flag> well you could set the starter pack bar low
2011-02-15T23:19:22  <antimatroid> that is always the plan
2011-02-15T23:19:38  <antimatroid> a beginner (that can at least program a bit) should be able to download a pack and actually improve the bot within the hour
2011-02-15T23:19:49  <antimatroid> it helps get them hooked
2011-02-15T23:20:13  <antimatroid> i am not disagreeing that the game should not be easy for people to understand and get started with, but i think i want to games to have more depth than some others beyond that
2011-02-15T23:20:25  <flag> ideally I think we should start with a bot that just follows walls or something, so they can make the step of actually going after food
2011-02-15T23:20:40  <antimatroid> that's the plan
2011-02-15T23:20:43  <antimatroid> :)
2011-02-15T23:20:56  <flag> well I'm not informed as to the plans :P
2011-02-15T23:21:57  <antimatroid> i do think it's important to keep the team for making games somewhat small in the future (like it is now)
2011-02-15T23:22:10  <antimatroid> not necessarily including me, people just tear each others throats out otherwise
2011-02-15T23:22:42  <flag> well it's kind of a do-opoly, anyone can pitch in, but if you don't pitch in you shouldn't get a say
2011-02-15T23:22:47  <flag> IMO

2011-02-15T23:23:13  <flag> engine*
2011-02-15T23:23:25  <antimatroid> mcleopold has pretty much been the engine writer
2011-02-15T23:23:44  <flag> Yeah it looks like all the code on the server is his
2011-02-15T23:23:49  <flag> Is he for option 1 or 2?
2011-02-15T23:24:01  <antimatroid> option 1, but more willing to budge than i
2011-02-15T23:24:23  <antimatroid> i just think option 1 makes for an awesome game that's still simple for people to get started with, it'd be a terrible shame to miss it
2011-02-15T23:24:36  <antimatroid> so i'll fight to the end
2011-02-15T23:24:41  <flag> :)
2011-02-15T23:26:30  <antimatroid> i still like my original ants game most :P
2011-02-15T23:27:52  <flag> what's the difference between yours and this one?
2011-02-15T23:28:01  <antimatroid> http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v3/
2011-02-15T23:28:23  <antimatroid> there was hp and harvest, you had to take harvest back home to get more ants and you could win by invading their base
2011-02-15T23:28:34  <antimatroid> and you had to "attack" an enemy ant, not just be near it
2011-02-15T23:29:02  <antimatroid> people didn't like the amount of information
2011-02-15T23:29:05  <pyro-> its the only sensible way i think :-)
2011-02-15T23:29:14  <antimatroid> what is?
2011-02-15T23:29:21  <pyro-> bot should have control of who he attack :-)
2011-02-15T23:29:40  <pyro-> then whole problem of who he attacking and who dies almost compeltly goes away
2011-02-15T23:29:44  <antimatroid> each ant dies if it gets attacked, each ant that "attacked" it gets an equal proportion of that ants value?
2011-02-15T23:30:04  <antimatroid> then you have ant collisions again
2011-02-15T23:30:16  <antimatroid> which is hard to pass information about
2011-02-15T23:30:32  <antimatroid> and it's a lot harder to work out who scored points from a kill
2011-02-15T23:30:54  <pyro-> why cant it be last one standing/most ants at ends win?
2011-02-15T23:30:58  <antimatroid> to me option 1 also has a very game of life appeal which is awesome
2011-02-15T23:31:08  <pyro-> hah
2011-02-15T23:31:10  <antimatroid> because it encourages long games
2011-02-15T23:31:22  <flag> I suppose the main problem with your ant-game is the new player appeal
2011-02-15T23:31:39  <antimatroid> it's very easy to store a "path home"
2011-02-15T23:31:55  <antimatroid> if you walk into a new square, add "direction home" as the direction to the square you just came from
2011-02-15T23:32:00  <antimatroid> a very bad naive path home algo
2011-02-15T23:32:13  <antimatroid> that's what the example bot is using
