2012-07-05T11:04:46  <citiral> Hello
2012-07-05T11:06:00  <citiral> I might be a little late to the party, but I started to create a bot for planet wars, but I seem to have a problem with getting the position of a planet.
2012-07-05T11:06:12  <citiral> (I'm using c#)
2012-07-05T11:06:16  <citiral> if I just enter:
2012-07-05T11:06:42  <citiral> Planet p = pw.GetPlanet(1);
2012-07-05T11:06:55  <citiral> Console.WriteLine( p.X() );
2012-07-05T11:07:10  <citiral> I get a huge number, suck as 80000
2012-07-05T11:07:26  <citiral> instead of the position the map file says.
2012-07-05T11:07:58  <citiral> And If I have 3 planets next to each other,:    P1   -----    P2   -----  P3
2012-07-05T11:08:31  <citiral> p1 gives an x value of about 50000 for example, p2 gives 10000 and then p3 suddenly gives 30000, meaning it should be in between p1 and p2

2012-07-05T11:12:11  <citiral> Hello.
2012-07-05T11:13:19  <citiral> You there?
2012-07-05T11:15:37  <mcstar> planet positions are small floats, not big integers
2012-07-05T11:16:12  <citiral> Even if I do
2012-07-05T11:16:19  <citiral> double x = p.x();
2012-07-05T11:16:24  <citiral> console.writelin(x);
2012-07-05T11:16:30  <citiral> it doesn't work :(
2012-07-05T11:16:38  <mcstar> .X() is the correct method
2012-07-05T11:16:55  <citiral> yes, I mean .X() , not .x()
2012-07-05T11:17:10  <mcstar> where did you get the code?
2012-07-05T11:17:46  <citiral> I wrote it myself, using the starter pack software.
2012-07-05T11:18:31  <mcstar> again, where did you get the code?
2012-07-05T11:19:19  <citiral> http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/starter_packages.php
2012-07-05T11:23:15  <citiral> http://pastebin.com/pJG12MyQ Here is the code of the AI (excluding the generic main function)
2012-07-05T11:23:49  <mcstar> im dont know c#, not sure what it calls when you do Planet p = pw.GetPlanet(1);
2012-07-05T11:24:05  <mcstar> could you put the whole thing in 1 expression?
2012-07-05T11:24:17  <citiral> it just returns the Planet instance with that ID.
2012-07-05T11:24:23  <mcstar> Console.WriteLine(pw.GetPlanet(1).X());
2012-07-05T11:24:28  <citiral> And I tried putting it all in one sentence.
2012-07-05T11:24:29  <mcstar> i know
2012-07-05T11:24:33  <citiral> That's what I first did :p
2012-07-05T11:24:34  <mcstar> but i dont know what it does with it
2012-07-05T11:25:08  <mcstar> where did you put the print statement?
2012-07-05T11:25:16  <citiral> It just does this:   return planets[planetID];
2012-07-05T11:25:24  <citiral> and I removed it there, I just added it for debugging purposes
2012-07-05T11:25:26  <mcstar> citiral: you dont understand me
2012-07-05T11:25:31  <mcstar> i see the code
2012-07-05T11:25:44  <mcstar> but still, i dont know how the = operator works in the language
2012-07-05T11:25:53  <mcstar> if you dont understand this, then you know less than me
2012-07-05T11:26:09  <citiral> You mean the difference between = and ==?
2012-07-05T11:26:14  <mcstar> no
2012-07-05T11:26:41  <mcstar> btw, this challenge took place ~2 years ago
2012-07-05T11:26:59  <citiral> I know, but beter late than never, I suppose.
2012-07-05T11:27:59  <mcstar> so, where did you put the writeline?
2012-07-05T11:28:28  <citiral> I added it at the top of DoTurn()
2012-07-05T11:29:24  <mcstar> add it to PlanetWars.cs after line 270
2012-07-05T11:29:52  <mcstar> just the compact one, possibly with some formatting to see the coordinates of the planets being parsed

2012-07-05T13:39:42  <citiral> Sorry, I was gone for a while.
2012-07-05T13:39:45  <citiral> I'm back now.
2012-07-05T13:41:34  <citiral> But I think i'm just gonna use Java, that works perfectly.
2012-07-05T13:41:59  <mcstar> citiral: this works too
2012-07-05T13:42:08  <mcstar> at least i made it work
2012-07-05T13:42:18  <citiral> How?
2012-07-05T13:42:31  <mcstar> what i dont understand is, how did you get an output in the first place?
2012-07-05T13:43:30  <citiral> I used the PlanetWarrior visualizer. That one has a log, that prints everything that is happening, so if I print to console, I can see it.
2012-07-05T13:43:53  <mcstar> ok, im not familiar with that
2012-07-05T13:44:15  <mcstar> what goes to stdout, supposed to go to the engine
2012-07-05T13:44:37  <mcstar> so, im not sure why would you want to output debugging info there

2012-07-05T13:44:55  <citiral> I know, so the game crashes when I print anything to the console on the end of the turn, but I just used it for quick and dirty debugging purposes.
2012-07-05T13:45:30  <mcstar> anyway, the engine seems to suppress the bots' stderr
2012-07-05T13:45:36  <mcstar> so you cant output there either
2012-07-05T13:45:47  <mcstar> so i wrote to a file
2012-07-05T13:46:46  <citiral> That works too :p. But how did you get it to properly get the coordinates?
2012-07-05T13:47:15  <mcstar> i didnt do anything special
2012-07-05T13:48:09  <citiral> So it might be my compiler screwing something up?

2012-07-05T13:53:01  <citiral> Nope, it doesn't work. It still outputs:  x: 337516,00, y: 16421,00
2012-07-05T13:54:01  <mcstar> citiral: what is the map file you run it with?
2012-07-05T13:54:06  <mcstar> im using map1.txt
2012-07-05T13:54:31  <mcstar> btw, what are those commas?
2012-07-05T13:54:46  <mcstar> x: 21.94, y: 14.28
2012-07-05T13:54:51  <mcstar> thats what i get
2012-07-05T13:55:06  <mcstar> are you on windows?
2012-07-05T13:55:10  <citiral> I was running map 21. map 1 gives: x: 219369,00, y: 142767,00
2012-07-05T13:55:23  <citiral> And yes, i'm on windows. I'm going to try the default visualizer.
2012-07-05T13:56:32  <mcstar> 21.9368952907 14.2766890117
2012-07-05T13:57:10  <mcstar> basically, they are multiplied by 10000
2012-07-05T13:57:53  <mcstar> obviously, the parsing causes this
2012-07-05T13:59:02  <mcstar> citiral: in the windows control something change the decimal notation to use . instead of ,
2012-07-05T13:59:09  <citiral> Probably. Maybe because my version of windows has the digit seperation symbol set to ,
2012-07-05T13:59:14  <mcstar> look for some locale settings
2012-07-05T13:59:22  <mcstar> or language and localization
2012-07-05T13:59:25  <mcstar> or somesuch
2012-07-05T13:59:28  <citiral> I know where to change that ;p.

2012-07-05T14:00:15  <citiral> Didn't change anything.
2012-07-05T14:02:45  <mcstar> you probably need to login again
2012-07-05T14:03:09  <mcstar> and you can ofc look at the parametrication of the parse function
2012-07-05T14:04:15  <citiral> I don't think I need to relog, I had trouble with the Decimal symbol before, and I didn't need a relog when I changed it.

2012-07-05T15:30:35  <mcstar> the input was ascii
2012-07-05T15:31:11  <thestinger> because that's how locales work
2012-07-05T15:31:17  <thestinger> they change sorting order and lots of things
2012-07-05T15:31:21  <mcstar> ok
2012-07-05T15:31:22  <thestinger> b"integer".upper() would be the same
2012-07-05T15:31:27  <mcstar> but i dont udnerstand this
2012-07-05T15:31:38  <mcstar> this obviously counter intuitive and sucks
2012-07-05T15:31:46  <thestinger> unicode sucks
2012-07-05T15:32:01  <thestinger> but it sucks because humans suck and came up with all these horrible languages
2012-07-05T15:32:06  <mcstar> its a codetable, how can it suck?
2012-07-05T15:32:11  <thestinger> unicode is pretty much as good as it can be to get the job done
2012-07-05T15:32:15  <thestinger> mcstar: it's not just a code table
2012-07-05T15:32:19  <thestinger> code point != character
2012-07-05T15:32:34  <thestinger> a character can be made of 10 code points
2012-07-05T15:32:50  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2012-07-05T15:32:52  <thestinger> python strings are code points, not characters
2012-07-05T15:32:56  <thestinger> same in most other languages
2012-07-05T15:33:02  <thestinger> so essentially, indexing them is useless
2012-07-05T15:33:03  <mcstar> what is a code point?
2012-07-05T15:33:19  <thestinger> "abc"[0] -> "a"
2012-07-05T15:33:26  <thestinger> that's indexing code points, not characters
2012-07-05T15:33:29  <thestinger> a code point is just a unicode unit
2012-07-05T15:33:39  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point
2012-07-05T15:33:53  <thestinger> utf-32 is just code points, but it doesn't mean you can just index it easily
2012-07-05T15:34:33  <thestinger> mcstar: for example, lots of characters cannot be represented by one code point
2012-07-05T15:34:42  <thestinger> and lots of characters have _many_ ways to represent them
2012-07-05T15:35:03  <thestinger> a == b -> False does not mean the strings are not 'equal' in the true sense (same characters)
2012-07-05T15:35:12  <thestinger> they could just use a different representation of the same characters
2012-07-05T15:35:14  <thestinger> it's a mess
2012-07-05T15:35:52  <thestinger> a 'grapheme' is the unicode unit for an actual visible character
2012-07-05T15:35:57  <thestinger> but that varies per locale
2012-07-05T15:36:18  <mcstar> so this is some overlapping indexing scheme?
2012-07-05T15:36:25  <thestinger> well, sort of
2012-07-05T15:36:42  <thestinger> mcstar: so at it's core, unicode is a 32-bit space indexed by code points
2012-07-05T15:36:46  <thestinger> except, language is not that simple
2012-07-05T15:36:52  <thestinger> you can combine these code points to make characters
2012-07-05T15:36:57  <thestinger> there are ligatures, combining characters
2012-07-05T15:37:04  <thestinger> there is left-to-right and right-to-left text
2012-07-05T15:37:13  <thestinger> it possibly needs to be embedded in other text
2012-07-05T15:37:35  <thestinger> mcstar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character for example
2012-07-05T15:37:52  <thestinger> lots of code points "a", "b", "c" are also graphemes (they're "pre-composed")
2012-07-05T15:37:54  <thestinger> but lots aren't
2012-07-05T15:37:54  <mcstar> i really dont care that much
2012-07-05T15:38:00  <thestinger> and ones that are pre-composed can still be combined
2012-07-05T15:38:33  <mcstar> i suggest you use your brainpower for more intelligent things
2012-07-05T15:39:00  <mcstar> or, are you planning to deliver multilingual applications in the near future?
2012-07-05T15:40:57  <thestinger> no :P
2012-07-05T15:41:11  <thestinger> human language just sucks
2012-07-05T15:41:21  <mcstar> thestinger: i asked 2 people of why would they use haiku
2012-07-05T15:41:22  <thestinger> stay far away from user-facing applications because you'll probably have to deal with it
2012-07-05T15:41:34  <mcstar> they reponded superficially
2012-07-05T15:41:40  <mcstar> i asked some deeper question
2012-07-05T15:41:44  <thestinger> human names are a similar clusterfuck :P
2012-07-05T15:41:44  <mcstar> so far no response...
2012-07-05T15:42:04  <thestinger> assuming people have a first and last name is a bug
2012-07-05T15:42:11  <thestinger> or even assuming they _have_ a name
2012-07-05T15:42:30  <mcstar> Welcome _!

2012-07-05T15:44:48  <thestinger> well, if you just have a single "name" field... then that's usually going to be fine
2012-07-05T15:44:59  <thestinger> but have "surname/forename" separate is ignorance
2012-07-05T15:45:02  <thestinger> lots of cultures don't have that
