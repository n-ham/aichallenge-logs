2011-08-23T04:44:29  <mleise> if it is an update you could look at a diff and check if the changes are sound
2011-08-23T04:44:36  <mleise> much like a peer review
2011-08-23T04:46:14  <antimatroid> but i don't know go? just check the semantics seems right?
2011-08-23T04:47:06  <mleise> Let's assume it compiles. Was this the fix for player_seed?
2011-08-23T04:47:43  <mleise> So, yes. If the changes make sense semantically then pull it :)

2011-08-23T04:51:51  <antimatroid> it assumes a max of 10 players i think in the debug.go file they've added
2011-08-23T04:52:39  <antimatroid> but i don't think it'd break with more players

2011-08-23T04:54:26  <mleise> I hadn't looked to deep into it. Just gave a hint that 'int' is too small for parameters like player_seed
2011-08-23T04:56:49  <antimatroid> it has PlayerSeed int64?
2011-08-23T04:57:01  <mleise> antimatroid: Oo *sure* !
2011-08-23T04:57:33  <antimatroid> sorry, I just looked at it, wasn't trying to be annoying :P
2011-08-23T04:57:50  <antimatroid> should I just pull it and then someone can revert it if someone complains?

2011-08-23T04:58:58  <mleise> between everyone working on the project. It is difficult to tell that the parameters are int64.
2011-08-23T04:59:31  <mleise> I don't know if the wiki has been updated and every starter bot programmer is aware of that
2011-08-23T04:59:48  <mleise> let me check the go usage count...
2011-08-23T05:00:17  <antimatroid> i doubt the wiki has been updated, as I haven't touched it and I was the only one doing it I think
2011-08-23T05:00:54  <antimatroid> I'm fairly busy with uni, but I could do that in a day or two once other stuff gets ready, but I don't think I'd be much help with the more vital stuff that needs fixing

2011-08-23T05:12:19  <Karlo_> I hadn't heard about any of this before tonight -- this bit with the ants, is that referring to a previous game rather than the current one?
2011-08-23T05:12:38  <antimatroid> b_jonas: no (t yet), last time someone made a visualiser locally that handled tcp games for people and allowed you to play your own bot
2011-08-23T05:12:50  <antimatroid> hopefully something like it is made again, it was by far the best debug tool I ever had
2011-08-23T05:13:09  <b_jonas> antimatroid: but does the server allow that, and is the game not too boring by hand?
2011-08-23T05:13:21  <antimatroid> Karlo_: the upcoming game is ants, but development has all but come to a stand still, eventually it should launch though
2011-08-23T05:13:38  <Karlo_> I see "Planet Wars" on the Web site.
2011-08-23T05:13:41  <antimatroid> you can't play as a human on the server, but locally you can make a program that would let you
2011-08-23T05:14:00  <antimatroid> Karlo_: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/index.php that's the beta site for ants

2011-08-23T05:14:41  <Karlo_> So what's the chronology here -- are *both* ants and planet wars in the queue as games that will be played between bots in the future?

2011-08-23T05:19:49  <antimatroid> well peoples bots are getting better, my one is down to 38th
2011-08-23T05:20:46  <b_jonas> so is this an annual contest somewhat similar to the ICFP contest?
2011-08-23T05:21:33  <antimatroid> there was 2 last year, this one was meant to start ages ago, but things have just sort of stalled
2011-08-23T05:21:48  <b_jonas> not necessarily annual then
2011-08-23T05:21:52  <antimatroid> yep
2011-08-23T05:22:52  <Karlo_> I see -- I hadn't noticed the dates on the schedule were 2010.

2011-08-23T05:26:51  <mleise> Planet Wars was a great challenge in deed :)
2011-08-23T05:27:17  <Karlo_> I recognize PW as being a relative of a game once known as Galaxy.

2011-08-23T05:27:55  <antimatroid> Karlo_: it was based on galcon, which you can play a multiplayer version of online
2011-08-23T05:28:03  <mleise> Karlo_: That's right and there are many Flash Player clones now as well
2011-08-23T05:28:06  <antimatroid> it's not exactly the same (asymmetric information) but still fun
2011-08-23T05:28:40  <antimatroid> n-player is very different to 2 player though
2011-08-23T05:28:50  <antimatroid> particularly with the complete graph
2011-08-23T05:29:14  <Karlo_> In fact, Galaxy is the game for which I wrote that n-player symmetry thing that I mentioned earlier.
2011-08-23T05:29:29  <antimatroid> that's pretty coincidental :D
2011-08-23T05:31:37  <Karlo_> So...  Maybe you already answered this...
2011-08-23T05:32:11  <Karlo_> The ai-contest.com page seems to be talking about Planet Wars exclusively.  How do I get to a page that talks about Ants?
2011-08-23T05:32:23  <antimatroid> with the link i gave above
2011-08-23T05:32:37  <antimatroid> it's the beta site, i'm not sure the ai-contest page links to it

2011-08-23T05:32:45  <contestbot> antimatroid: beta could be http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/.
2011-08-23T05:32:50  <antimatroid> or that :)
2011-08-23T05:33:06  <Karlo_> OK
2011-08-23T05:33:25  <antimatroid> i'm off to prepare some dinner, i'm starving
2011-08-23T05:35:22  <Karlo_> I haven't entered any sort of bot contest for years...
2011-08-23T05:36:30  <antimatroid> it's very fun, and very time consuming :)
2011-08-23T05:36:47  <Karlo_> The last one I did, I believe I had an unbeatable bot (as did several other players; the game was solvable), but the organizer said that mine aborted on one of my own bugchecks.
2011-08-23T05:36:51  <antimatroid> once it launches it should run for like 2 months or so
2011-08-23T05:37:04  <antimatroid> oh don't remind me :P
2011-08-23T05:37:17  <Karlo_> I later grabbed the referee source code and all bots, and tried it myself, and it seemed to work just fine.  I never did find out what happened.
2011-08-23T05:37:29  <antimatroid> i got disqualified in tron because of an arcane rule at the time which said that a single timeout was grounds for disqualification
2011-08-23T05:37:45  <antimatroid> i never even got to see the game i timed out on
2011-08-23T05:38:37  <antimatroid> http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/profile_games.php?user_id=2788 that was my (and my friends) bots run until timing out, we were ranked ~10th
2011-08-23T05:39:48  <antimatroid> timeouts just meant you lose in planet wars, in ants it means all your ants stop moving and you stop accumulating points (the still ants can spawn if food spawns next to them, the idea being to minimise the advantage to neighbouring bots)
2011-08-23T05:40:18  <antimatroid> the relative symmetric / 2-transitive maps could really fix that problem
2011-08-23T05:40:20  <Karlo_> How long is the timeout?
2011-08-23T05:40:42  <antimatroid> not sure what it currently is, 500 or 1000ms i think, it's passed to the bots at the start of the game as a parameter
2011-08-23T05:40:48  <b_jonas> wait... does the game spontanously add new food to the map after the start of the game? how about spontanously removing food (rotting)?
2011-08-23T05:41:05  <antimatroid> so that we can change it without people bitching about hard coding stuff, there's quite a few parameters like that because in the past people winge when things change
2011-08-23T05:41:16  <Karlo_> Right
2011-08-23T05:41:33  <antimatroid> b_jonas: no removal of food that doesn't spawn, but we symmetrically (from starting positions) spawn food
2011-08-23T05:41:58  <Karlo_> Did you ever play Core War?
2011-08-23T05:42:09  <antimatroid> we find a basis of land squares for the grid, randomly order them, then spawn food at a given rate to those cells, if a cell is "taken" then the food spawns there on the next turn that it isn't
2011-08-23T05:42:16  <antimatroid> nope, but it sounded sweet
2011-08-23T05:42:35  <antimatroid> basis/generating set
2011-08-23T05:42:37  <Karlo_> I'd read the CW rules and didn't like it -- it seemed that offense was way easier than defense.
2011-08-23T05:42:40  <b_jonas> I see, thanks
2011-08-23T05:42:42  <antimatroid> basis probably isn't the right word :P
2011-08-23T05:43:03  <b_jonas> it would be nice if the specification mentioned this
2011-08-23T05:43:27  <antimatroid> yes, eventually i'll add it sorry, it's in beta and stuff changes so I got sick of changing things all the time
2011-08-23T05:43:46  <antimatroid> once the game is pretty much good to launch I'll go through and make the specs more correct and complete
2011-08-23T05:44:14  <b_jonas> thank you
2011-08-23T05:44:22  <antimatroid> but I also have to limit the amount of maths terminology in the specs because the game is meant to be easy enough for beginner programmers but deep enough to be interesting to more experienced programmers
2011-08-23T05:44:42  <antimatroid> if you have any queries, i think I know most things to do with game mechanics, so just harrass me here
2011-08-23T05:44:54  <antimatroid> I should respond within 24 hours if no one else does

2011-08-23T05:46:47  <Karlo_> My understanding (possibly incorrect) is that Core War was invented when someone misremembered the rules to the older game Darwin.  I always thought Darwin was the better game, and I've created implementations of it a few times for different architectures.
2011-08-23T05:46:49  <Karlo_> My latest one runs as an emulator of an absurdly reduced instruction set; it requires a significant number of instructions to do anything useful at all.  I'm hoping this makes it challenging enough to avoid the problems of McIlroy's original game.
2011-08-23T05:47:23  <antimatroid> Karlo_: planet wars was probably the most interesting of "our" games mathematically, it was a sweet "problem" but it ended up being quite inpenetrable with respect to really good ai's, except bocsimaco who showed EVERYONE up
2011-08-23T05:47:34  <Karlo_> Interesting.
2011-08-23T05:47:54  <antimatroid> he had a "2 ply" minimax tree for the first turn then not entirely sure after that
2011-08-23T05:48:24  <Karlo_> I have a couple of games on my own machine that I've wanted to write AIs for.
2011-08-23T05:49:06  <antimatroid> the "long term" plan is to rewrite everything to handle multiple contests and have old ones set up sort of like project euler
2011-08-23T05:49:15  <Karlo_> Nice.
2011-08-23T05:49:27  <antimatroid> but at the current rate that isn't happening in the near future
2011-08-23T05:49:29  <Karlo_> Have you ever heard of the GGP project at Stanford?
2011-08-23T05:49:34  <antimatroid> nope?
2011-08-23T05:49:40  <Karlo_> GGP is General Game Playing.
2011-08-23T05:50:01  <antimatroid> oh, i would love to do something like that
2011-08-23T05:50:19  <Karlo_> The contestants write bots that are designed not for playing a specific game optimally, but for playing *any* game adequately.
2011-08-23T05:50:20  <antimatroid> i'm doing my honours thesis on structure properties of normal form games
2011-08-23T05:50:39  <Karlo_> So they have to be prepared to deal with games they've never seen before.
2011-08-23T05:50:45  <antimatroid> basically playing around with isomorphisms and symmetric games and filling in the few blank steps to set up a category
2011-08-23T05:51:13  <antimatroid> and I have a c++ library for game theory stuff, which I would love to use for a ggp type bot and have considered it
2011-08-23T05:51:20  <Karlo_> Cool.
2011-08-23T05:51:45  <antimatroid> if only I had infinite time to do all the things I want to :(
2011-08-23T05:51:54  <Karlo_> Agreed!
2011-08-23T05:53:30  <b_jonas> a game I wonder might be interesting to hold AI contests of is single player rubber's rummy where one player controls multiple hands (say four hands) and the goal is to quit in as few turns as possible
2011-08-23T05:54:45  <Karlo_> GGP does simultaneous or sequential play, solitaire or two-player or multi-player, cooperative or competitive.
2011-08-23T05:55:01  <antimatroid> the real problem I would enjoy tackling is filling in the blanks between obtaining the game rules and constructing a game to choose a (n equilibrium) strategy from
2011-08-23T05:55:57  <Karlo_> I programmed a few game descriptions but didn't actually test them on the GGP server with actual playerbots.
2011-08-23T05:56:02  <antimatroid> b_jonas: so far we've just dealt with simultaneous games for this, personally I think they're strategically more interesting, but others probably don't agree with me there
2011-08-23T05:56:31  <antimatroid> i do however enjoy extensive form games too and have the code for representing those, but it's not clean enough to have up on github
2011-08-23T05:56:33  <b_jonas> sure, I like multiplayer games as well
2011-08-23T05:56:47  <antimatroid> multiplayer games can be simultaneous :P
2011-08-23T05:56:54  <Karlo_> Indeed.
2011-08-23T05:58:19  <Karlo_> Liar's Dice would make a good AI testbed, I think.
2011-08-23T05:58:38  <antimatroid> one game people are quite interested in is something like risk
2011-08-23T05:58:45  <antimatroid> but i don't personally know much about the game
2011-08-23T05:58:57  <antimatroid> i think dots and boxes could be interesting too
2011-08-23T05:59:03  <Karlo_> Yeah
2011-08-23T05:59:29  <antimatroid> do you know anything about dynamical games (aka multiplayer optimal control theory if you ask me?)
2011-08-23T05:59:34  <antimatroid> a 3d chasing game would be interesting
2011-08-23T05:59:41  <b_jonas> dots and boxes require thinking. it's not the kind of game I like.
2011-08-23T05:59:48  <Karlo_> Cosmic Tag?
2011-08-23T05:59:55  <Karlo_> Just a sec, let me pull up my notes :-D
2011-08-23T06:00:08  <b_jonas> you mean a simple 3d fps?
2011-08-23T06:00:19  <antimatroid> well, i'm thinking planes in combat
2011-08-23T06:00:42  <antimatroid> so you have motion in 3d and you have to shoot your enemy down or something
2011-08-23T06:01:39  <Karlo_> Basic version of Cosmic Tag: Two ships, arbitrary Newtonian acceleration with maximum magnitude A.  Maintain position, velocity, acceleration data for each.  Tagger wins by getting within distance 1 of Runner.  Runner wins by getting within distance K of Origin.
2011-08-23T06:02:10  <b_jonas> that gets interesting with many players only, right?
2011-08-23T06:02:40  <Karlo_> There are no turns -- you submit orders whenever you like, and specify when they should take effect, if not immediately.
2011-08-23T06:03:05  <Karlo_> The original implementation of this concept was done in real time, over a period of months.
2011-08-23T06:03:44  <antimatroid> i imagine the solution to that in 3d isn't different to 2d?
2011-08-23T06:03:46  <antimatroid> just generalised?
2011-08-23T06:04:02  <antimatroid> the chaser/evader problem predator/prey whatever
2011-08-23T06:04:08  <b_jonas> also, how many walls?
2011-08-23T06:04:16  <Karlo_> A little trickier in 3d, I think.
2011-08-23T06:04:41  <antimatroid> although I don't think that puts constraints on change of angle / velocity (I don't know physics very well)
2011-08-23T06:04:42  <Karlo_> No walls in this game -- the *only* objects in the universe are the two ships, and the fixed origin.
2011-08-23T06:05:52  <antimatroid> ideally i'd want a symmetric game, but such a complicated game would never fly for an ai contest anyway
2011-08-23T06:05:57  <antimatroid> so isn't that important
2011-08-23T06:06:57  <Karlo_> Strange.  I was sure I had another file related to this game, somewhere.
2011-08-23T06:11:02  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-23T06:11:10  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-208-118.dynamic.chello.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-23T06:13:30  <Karlo_> Oh, here's a different (symmetric) game I've toyed with...
2011-08-23T06:14:22  <Karlo_> n players, arranged randomly in a circle; each simultaneously chooses either "Attack" or "Defend".
2011-08-23T06:14:46  <Karlo_> If someone attacks you and you're not defending, you're eliminated.
2011-08-23T06:15:41  <b_jonas> Karlo_: um no, the rules are a bit complicated than that
2011-08-23T06:15:46  <Karlo_> (In the original version, you could attack any other player; in the version I was analyzing mathematically, I restricted it only being able to attack the player to your immediate right.  So you're defending against the player to your left.)
2011-08-23T06:15:58  <b_jonas> Karlo_: you can choose to defend, attack, or charge
2011-08-23T06:16:03  <Karlo_> Different game.
2011-08-23T06:16:08  <b_jonas> but you can attack only if you have charged since your last attack
2011-08-23T06:18:08  <Karlo_> If there's only *one* attacker in some round, then that player wins immediately -- that's the only rule thwarting the "always defend" strategy.
2011-08-23T06:18:46  <Karlo_> Otherwise, the attacks are resolved, the circle closes up, it gets a new random ordering for the next round, and the game continues.
2011-08-23T06:19:30  <Karlo_> If some round eliminates everybody at once, then those who survived the longest (the participants in the final round) share the win equally.
2011-08-23T06:20:09  <antimatroid> that is neat
2011-08-23T06:20:33  <antimatroid> i like the graph game where one player tries to join two nodes by "fixing edges" and another tries to separate them by removing non-fixed edges
2011-08-23T06:20:39  <antimatroid> not simultaneous though
2011-08-23T06:20:47  <Karlo_> I came up with an approximately optimal strategy for n-player...
2011-08-23T06:21:11  <Karlo_> but a good AI would probably do opponent modeling, keeping track of what other players have done in the past.
2011-08-23T06:21:30  <Karlo_> If a mad attacker is behind you this round, you might just want to defend.
2011-08-23T06:22:01  <Karlo_> Ah yes -- that graph game has an unfortunate number of names.
2011-08-23T06:22:13  <Karlo_> Bird Cage, Gale, Shannon's Switching Game...
2011-08-23T06:22:42  <Karlo_> I rather liked "Short Circuit" as a name, but there's no point in adding another one to the collection.
2011-08-23T06:24:12  <antimatroid> in the games we've done so far you don't know who your enemy is
2011-08-23T06:24:23  <antimatroid> and you can't write to file on the main servers
2011-08-23T06:24:33  <antimatroid> you can of course locally for debugging purposes or training parameters
2011-08-23T06:24:40  <Karlo_> We can imagine the graph to be made of resistors; one player is joining the nodes (reducing the resistance to zero) while the other is cutting them (increasing the resistance to infinity).
2011-08-23T06:26:46  <antimatroid> Karlo_: a fun problem i had when I was playing around with ants was a* search with multiple sources and targets
2011-08-23T06:27:43  <antimatroid> it you use T as the set of targets (say food locations) then the heuristic h(x) = argmin_{* in L}mdist(x, *) is admissible
2011-08-23T06:28:12  <antimatroid> and you can just add all of your source locations to the search queue before you start searching
2011-08-23T06:29:35  <Karlo_> Do you know the game Arimaa?
2011-08-23T06:29:48  <Karlo_> It's like Chess, but better.  :-)
2011-08-23T06:29:56  <antimatroid> yes, janzert has (I think) the third best bot from the last few years
2011-08-23T06:30:07  <antimatroid> he has been one of the bigger contributers here
2011-08-23T06:30:09  <Karlo_> OK
2011-08-23T06:30:43  <antimatroid> i have thought a little bit about it, but haven't actually written a bot
2011-08-23T06:31:08  <antimatroid> i would like to try implementing it as a kind of graphical game (not the normal graphical game def)
2011-08-23T06:31:11  <Karlo_> I haven't even seriously considered writing one -- I don't play the game well enough, myself.
2011-08-23T06:31:26  <antimatroid> i don't really play games
2011-08-23T06:31:34  <antimatroid> i just like writing bots and game theory :P
2011-08-23T06:31:49  <Karlo_> Heh, OK
2011-08-23T06:31:59  <Karlo_> (I do both game theory and actual games.)
2011-08-23T06:32:12  <antimatroid> what kind of game theory stuff do you do?
2011-08-23T06:32:28  <Karlo_> Did you see my monolog about the game of Hi-Lo, a week or so ago?
2011-08-23T06:32:34  <antimatroid> nope?
2011-08-23T06:32:49  <Karlo_> That's my name for the simple number-guessing game, similar to Twenty Questions...
2011-08-23T06:32:53  <antimatroid> i'm lucky enough that my advisor will let me play around with game theory but nobody in my maths department really knows anything about it
2011-08-23T06:33:34  <antimatroid> have you heard of andy mclennan? i've contemplated trying to do a phd under him, but he's in an economics department, otherwise i might just do a phd where I am (tasmania)
2011-08-23T06:33:34  <Karlo_> Hider picks an integer 1 <= x <= n; Seeker guesses numbers one at a time.  After each incorrect guess, Hider replies with whether x is higher or lower.  The payoff is the number of guesses.
2011-08-23T06:33:50  <antimatroid> either on game theory stuff or just category theory/something algebraey
2011-08-23T06:34:15  <Karlo_> The naive strategies are (Hider) uniform on 1..n; (Seeker) binary search.  But neither one is optimal in the game theory sense.
2011-08-23T06:35:01  <antimatroid> what is optimal?
2011-08-23T06:35:13  <Karlo_> The smallest interesting case is n=3, where the game value is 1.8.
2011-08-23T06:35:38  <antimatroid> is that for the worst case of binary search or..?
2011-08-23T06:35:53  <Karlo_> Average case, under optimal play.
2011-08-23T06:36:05  <Karlo_> Hider's optimal strategy is ([1] 2/5, [2] 1/5, [3] 2/5).
2011-08-23T06:36:24  <Karlo_> Seeker's optimal strategy is ([2] 3/5, [1-3-2] 1/5, [3-1-2] 1/5).
2011-08-23T06:37:00  <Karlo_> Game value = 9/5.
2011-08-23T06:37:24  <antimatroid> i'm confused
2011-08-23T06:38:06  <Karlo_> Ask a question, and perhaps I can unconfuse.
2011-08-23T06:38:10  <antimatroid> wouldn't seeker go something like 3/2 -> etc.
2011-08-23T06:38:26  <Karlo_> The search space is {1, 2, 3}.
2011-08-23T06:38:27  <antimatroid> as in 1.5 -> 1.75 -> 1.875 -> ...
2011-08-23T06:38:48  <Karlo_> Hider is in one of those three positions.  No fractions.
2011-08-23T06:38:50  <antimatroid> oh, so mixed strategies?
2011-08-23T06:38:55  <Karlo_> Yes
2011-08-23T06:38:59  <antimatroid> okay
2011-08-23T06:39:38  <Karlo_> Binary search would be to start at 2; if Hider isn't there, then Seeker can definitely find him on the 2nd guess.
2011-08-23T06:39:46  <antimatroid> yep
2011-08-23T06:40:04  <antimatroid> fractions would make it a lot harder :P
2011-08-23T06:40:08  <Karlo_> But the mixed strategy reduces it to 9/5.
2011-08-23T06:40:30  <antimatroid> (countably) infinitely harder
2011-08-23T06:40:46  <Karlo_> And difficult to define the goal :-)
2011-08-23T06:41:03  <antimatroid> find p,q such that p/q \in [0, 3]?
2011-08-23T06:41:12  <antimatroid> and you get high or lower
2011-08-23T06:41:52  <Karlo_> With infinitely many hiding places available?  I think that every strategy is dominated.
2011-08-23T06:42:30  <antimatroid> what about if you constrain p and q?
2011-08-23T06:42:51  <Karlo_> I've already considered some other modifications to the game that I think are more interesting, actually.
2011-08-23T06:42:53  <antimatroid> it's not necessarily equivalent to  just increasing n i don't think?
2011-08-23T06:43:31  <Karlo_> (This would actually be more suitable to #math -- shall I go back there?)
2011-08-23T06:43:43  <antimatroid> no one will mind here
2011-08-23T06:43:45  <Karlo_> OK
2011-08-23T06:44:06  <antimatroid> (i hope :P)
2011-08-23T06:44:07  <Karlo_> First, let me finish what I found about the basic game.
2011-08-23T06:44:35  <Karlo_> For large n, the value is log_2(n) + O(1), as you might expect.
2011-08-23T06:46:23  <Karlo_> I have the optimal Hider strategies for 1 <= n <= 23.
2011-08-23T06:47:47  <Karlo_> For many of those n, it turns out that it's optimal for Hider to use a uniform distribution except for double-weighting the endpoints -- i.e., the mixed strategy (2 1 1 ... 1 1 2) / (n+2).
2011-08-23T06:48:15  <Karlo_> This is true for 3..4, 7..10, 17..23
2011-08-23T06:49:03  <antimatroid> that's pretty neat
2011-08-23T06:49:12  <Karlo_> And for several values of n, it's optimal for Hider to use a different near-uniform distribution proportional to (5 3 2 2 2 ... 2 2 2 3 5).
2011-08-23T06:49:31  <Karlo_> This is true for 4..6, 15..16
2011-08-23T06:50:29  <Karlo_> For 11..14, and also 24..31 which I haven't solved, neither of those is optimal.
2011-08-23T06:51:38  <b_jonas> Karlo_: this Hider/Seeker game you mention is funny
2011-08-23T06:51:41  <Karlo_> (If you were paying attention, you might notice that I listed n=4 in both of those sets -- n=4 is the only known case where there's more than one optimal strategy.)
2011-08-23T06:52:39  <Karlo_> Funny how?
2011-08-23T06:52:48  <b_jonas> also, it's natural that the value is log_2(n)+O(1) because (a) from the seeker any binary search wins within that much time, but (b) if the hider is uniform then the seeker surely can't be much smarter
2011-08-23T06:52:57  <Karlo_> Right
2011-08-23T06:53:58  <Karlo_> I conjecture lg(n) - 1 + 2s/(1+s) - lg(1+s) + lg(n)/n + O(1/n) for the asymptotic behavior, which is much more precise...
2011-08-23T06:54:31  <b_jonas> what's s ?
2011-08-23T06:54:59  <Karlo_> where s = n/2^floor(lg(n)) - 1, which is in [0,1)
2011-08-23T06:55:47  <Karlo_> I.e., the O(1) component has a "wobble" that depends on how close n is to being a power of two.
2011-08-23T06:56:13  <mleise> This was the first game I implemented at school when casio borrowed us those programmable calculators
2011-08-23T06:58:18  <Karlo_> So anyway, here are the variants I was considering:
2011-08-23T06:58:57  *** sigh_ <sigh_!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-23T06:59:22  <Karlo_> * Delay Hi-Lo: after each wrong guess, Hider reports the outcome of the *previous* guess rather than the current one.  This changes the asymptotic behavior from log_2(n) to log_phi(n).
2011-08-23T06:59:24  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-08-23T07:00:39  <Karlo_> * Liar Hi-Lo: after a wrong guess, Hider is permitted to lie about the direction of x, but only once per game.  (Inspired by Ulam's problem.)  Asymptotic behavior is log_b(n) for some phi <= b <= 2; I don't know the value yet.
2011-08-23T07:01:21  <Karlo_> (Oh, actually that last result is for *worst case* behavior rather than optimal play.)
2011-08-23T07:02:49  <Karlo_> * Mover Hi-Lo: after a wrong guess, Hider is permitted to either keep the current value of x, or add 1 to it.  (Yes, I know I could make it symmetric by also allowing him to subtract 1, but it turns out that this is already complex enough.)  Still asymptotically log_2(n).  Smallest interesting case is n=5; it was quite difficult to find the exact solution.
2011-08-23T07:03:01  <Karlo_> [end of list]
2011-08-23T07:03:16  <antimatroid> i'm interested in the dynamics of the liar version
2011-08-23T07:03:24  <antimatroid> how complicated can a contradiction become?
2011-08-23T07:03:47  <Karlo_> Seeker's knowledge state is encoded by a 4-tuple.
2011-08-23T07:04:17  <Karlo_> a <= x is certain; b <= x is claimed, x <= c is claimed; x <= d is certain.
2011-08-23T07:05:27  <Karlo_> Once a contradiction has been revealed -- q <= x and x <= p both asserted, where p < q -- Seeker just switches to binary search on the set of possible points.
2011-08-23T07:06:13  <antimatroid> :)
2011-08-23T07:08:31  <Karlo_> Maybe Liar Hi-Lo would make a good game for a bot competition?
2011-08-23T07:11:47  <antimatroid> not sure people would find it that interesting tbh
2011-08-23T07:12:14  <Karlo_> Challenging to program, but pretty boring to watch, I imagine.
2011-08-23T07:12:19  <antimatroid> i've found the types of games that interest mathematicians don't interest most people
2011-08-23T07:12:28  <Karlo_> Yep
2011-08-23T07:12:47  <antimatroid> they want it to be fun to play and watch, i mostly want it to be fun to think about
2011-08-23T07:12:50  <antimatroid> to each their own
2011-08-23T07:13:49  <Karlo_> During one of the GGP competitions, the bots were moving somewhat randomly, not seeming to make any progress; it was kind of annoying.
2011-08-23T07:14:10  <Karlo_> I felt like I was watching the Special Olympics.  :-)
2011-08-23T07:14:56  <antimatroid> qwopolympics?
2011-08-23T07:15:09  <antimatroid> one does not simply qwop anywhere
2011-08-23T07:16:07  <Karlo_> I don't know what that means
2011-08-23T07:16:40  <antimatroid> let me introduce you to the hardest game ever made
2011-08-23T07:16:43  <antimatroid> http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html
2011-08-23T07:17:54  <Karlo_> Liar Hi-Lo for n = 10^6 might actually be interesting to watch.]
2011-08-23T07:22:09  <antimatroid> Karlo_: would my relative symmetry thing be equivalent to requiring the game be symmetric for any subset of the players (eliminating the others) (with at least two players)
2011-08-23T07:23:54  <Karlo_> Possibly.
2011-08-23T07:25:01  <antimatroid> did you play qwop?
2011-08-23T07:25:14  <antimatroid> i can't play it to save my life, but... there's a hurdle at 50m
2011-08-23T07:25:41  *** dlila <dlila!~dlila@CPE0014d1c9243c-CM001bd71cede2.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-23T07:27:06  <Karlo_> Nope.  I have Flash disabled on this machine, and the one that can do it is currently in an awkward spot to use.
2011-08-23T07:27:19  <Karlo_> I read the description on Wikipedia, though.
2011-08-23T07:32:54  <Karlo_> I just scrolled back to my summary of Hi-Lo variants.  I misspoke: for Mover Hi-Lo, the first interesting case is n=3, and *that* was difficult to solve.
2011-08-23T07:34:25  <antimatroid> i take it you haven't solved greater then?
2011-08-23T07:34:33  <Karlo_> Correct.
2011-08-23T07:35:20  <Karlo_> Basic up to n=23; Liar up to n=5; Mover up to n=3.
2011-08-23T07:35:47  <antimatroid> solve all the things
2011-08-23T07:36:21  <Karlo_> Perhaps Delay-Liar-Mover Hi-Lo would make an interesting bot challenge :-D
2011-08-23T07:37:38  <antimatroid> same problem :P
2011-08-23T07:37:59  <Karlo_> In 3d, with a cool graphics display!!
2011-08-23T07:42:04  <Karlo_> There's a game I used to play in college -- and then taught to family members -- that I thought had an excellent fun/complexity ratio.  It seemed to me that it should be possible to write a bot for it, but it's yet another item that I never got around to doing.
2011-08-23T07:43:27  <Karlo_> My brother did write a bot for a simplified version of the game, and then claimed that the game was no longer playable because the bots always won -- but that was because their primary strategy was "team up with any other bots in the game, and attack the human"
2011-08-23T07:52:56  <mleise> antimatroid: I found QWOP can crawl on one knee, using the other leg to give little impulses forwards
2011-08-23T08:18:49  <antimatroid> mleise: with q and w? so did i, i got like 9 metres :P
2011-08-23T08:18:58  <antimatroid> i would have been screwed if i made it to the hurdle though
2011-08-23T08:19:16  <mleise> there is a hurdle? geez, that's impossible

2011-08-23T08:21:10  <antimatroid> seems you can just knock it over
2011-08-23T08:28:01  <Karlo_> OK, I'm off to bed now

2011-08-23T09:14:00  <Byteroot> I'm using windows XP and Python32 installed

2011-08-23T09:23:53  <Byteroot> Should I install 2.7.x version ?

2011-08-23T09:25:21  <Byteroot> Thank you. I will try it
2011-08-23T09:26:05  <berak> you could uncheck the 'install' option in the installer, so it won't override your 3.2 settings
2011-08-23T09:26:50  <Byteroot> thanks once more =) I never worked with python before
