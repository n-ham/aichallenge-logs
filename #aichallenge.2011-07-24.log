2011-07-24T00:59:36  <mleise> mmm
2011-07-24T01:01:09  <mleise> bhasker: like this: http://pastebin.com/qK0FG7xr
2011-07-24T01:04:05  <antimatroid> i suck at reading other peoples code :\
2011-07-24T01:04:27  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/gqCA8u5N  that's how i do vision, but i think sigh had a faster way
2011-07-24T01:04:38  <mleise> antimatroid: oh you will soon work for someone and read their code :)
2011-07-24T01:05:03  <antimatroid> might not, contemplating phd next year :P
2011-07-24T01:05:26  <antimatroid> ignore all the other people :)
2011-07-24T01:05:58  <mleise> to be fair i have a call to interpolate in it and render the fog into a huge 32-bit bitmap (120x120 x 20x20 = 5,760,000 Pixels)
2011-07-24T01:06:59  <mleise> interpolate calculates the properties of an ant at a given time (color, size, position, ...)
2011-07-24T01:07:07  <antimatroid> i'm still not over the fact that i have to index matrices of bools as visited[loc.row][loc.col] instead of visited[loc], stupid c++ :(
2011-07-24T01:07:33  <mleise> antimatroid: again, use byte as the datatype and you're done
2011-07-24T01:07:51  <antimatroid> but doesn't that slow it/take more space whatever? :P
2011-07-24T01:07:53  <mleise> add a typedef if you want a more fitting name, like bytebool
2011-07-24T01:08:23  <mleise> antimatroid: it takes 8x the space, but it should be faster (i think)
2011-07-24T01:08:30  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-07-24T01:08:37  <antimatroid> space is generally not really that much of a concern
2011-07-24T01:09:06  <mleise> it is a simple check for 0, whereas the bit-array includes some bitshifting
2011-07-24T01:09:46  <antimatroid> is it better to check is/n't 0 rather than is/n't 1?
2011-07-24T01:09:49  <mleise> at least i don't know how you could check for a set bit without bit shifting
2011-07-24T01:11:01  <bhasker> let me have a look
2011-07-24T01:11:27  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-24T01:11:28  <mleise> hmm. iirc after an arithmetic operation the result bits are updated (overflow, zero, parity, ...) so the compiler could use those. generally testing for zero or one... I don't know. That might not make a difference
2011-07-24T01:12:08  <mleise> It has bin some time since I last wrote in assembly
2011-07-24T01:12:16  <mleise> *been
2011-07-24T01:12:47  <bhasker> k that code will take some time to make sense of
2011-07-24T01:13:24  <mleise> antimatroid: I always check for == or != 0, just to be sure ;). It can't hurt anyway.
2011-07-24T01:13:42  <bhasker> can you explain is simple words how you are building the fog of war
2011-07-24T01:14:25  <bhasker> one way would be to just do a bfs around each ant and paint each visible square
2011-07-24T01:14:49  <antimatroid> that's what i do
2011-07-24T01:15:01  <bhasker> yea i looked at your code and modified it for other stuff that i do
2011-07-24T01:15:04  <mleise> bhasker: I first set all squares to fog, then I ... seem to prepare some sort of lookup table
2011-07-24T01:15:15  <antimatroid> another is to make a set of translate amounts that gives the vision squares and paint that around each ant
2011-07-24T01:15:22  <bhasker> another way would be to do some precalculation upfront
2011-07-24T01:15:31  <bhasker> just for each location build a set of visible locations up front
2011-07-24T01:15:41  <bhasker> then just sort + uniq the total
2011-07-24T01:16:02  <bhasker> then each iteration just extract a list of locations for each ant + sort + uniq it
2011-07-24T01:16:11  <bhasker> but doubt that will be faster than doing a bfs around each ant
2011-07-24T01:16:34  <antimatroid> i think my second one would be faster than bfs
2011-07-24T01:16:37  <mleise> no wait, i first set visible all squares on a + around the ant
2011-07-24T01:16:40  <antimatroid> it's essentially the same thing but without the bfs
2011-07-24T01:17:17  <bhasker> look at antimatroids C++ starter bot
2011-07-24T01:17:26  <bhasker> it has a function to paint the vision of a bot
2011-07-24T01:17:35  <bhasker> that should work for building a fog of war
2011-07-24T01:17:45  <mleise> and then there is a lookup for the wrapping, when I reach the top, bottom, left or right side of the map
2011-07-24T01:18:38  <bhasker> again look at antimatroid's c++ bot it does it without any lookups
2011-07-24T01:18:46  <bhasker> well not without any lookups
2011-07-24T01:18:50  <bhasker> there is a small lookup
2011-07-24T01:19:13  <antimatroid> what's a lookup?
2011-07-24T01:19:24  <mleise> a translation table
2011-07-24T01:19:27  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp/State.cc that has the starter bot updatevision function
2011-07-24T01:20:29  <mleise> "THE OBVIOUS WAY OF TRYING TO IMPROVE IT BREAKS USING THE EUCLIDEAN METRIC" Oo
2011-07-24T01:20:56  <antimatroid> i still think it's worth setting it up as a graph and removing neighbour information with water, the visualiser even knows all the water information at the start, so it doesn't need to worry about having to remove edges from the graph
2011-07-24T01:21:09  <antimatroid> mleise: yeah, i kinda wish we hadn't used euclidean for vision, but we did
2011-07-24T01:21:31  <antimatroid> it's because of:
2011-07-24T01:21:31  <antimatroid> a.*
2011-07-24T01:21:31  <antimatroid> .a.
2011-07-24T01:21:47  <antimatroid> both ants have the same "walk/search" distance to * but a different euclidean distance
2011-07-24T01:22:09  <bhasker> so you suggest we should have used manhattan?
2011-07-24T01:22:09  <antimatroid> and i think there was another problem too, cause my trivial idea to fix that didn't work
2011-07-24T01:22:10  <mleise> a graph in the visualizer? what are you talking about?
2011-07-24T01:22:17  <antimatroid> manhatten or chebyshev
2011-07-24T01:22:25  <bhasker> i have no idea what chebyshev is
2011-07-24T01:22:29  <mleise> squares?
2011-07-24T01:22:41  <antimatroid> melise: i store my grid in my actual bot with neighbour locations at each square, so i don't actually need to call get location after the first turn
2011-07-24T01:23:17  <mleise> so you are practically 'position independent'?
2011-07-24T01:23:19  <antimatroid> cdist(x,y) := min (|x.row-y.row|, |x.col-y.col|) i think
2011-07-24T01:23:30  <antimatroid> position independent?
2011-07-24T01:23:39  <mleise> hmm you still use coordinates -.-
2011-07-24T01:23:48  <mleise> I though you just have a graph :D
2011-07-24T01:23:54  <antimatroid> change that to max
2011-07-24T01:24:06  <antimatroid> i still have a matrix with my squares
2011-07-24T01:24:24  <antimatroid> and index the locations with that, but each square has a vector of neighbour locations that aren't water which i use for pathfinding etc.
2011-07-24T01:24:54  <antimatroid> although i've given up on having time to write a proper bot
2011-07-24T01:26:52  <antimatroid> basically, euclidean "circle" is a circle, manhatten "circle" is a diamond, and chebyshev "circle" is a square
2011-07-24T01:27:10  <mleise> wow this c++ code looks like it will be *slow* in JavaScript ;)
2011-07-24T01:27:27  <antimatroid> what from?
2011-07-24T01:28:09  <mleise> there are so many hash objects generated
2011-07-24T01:29:00  <antimatroid> mleise: what i think would make it faster is the have a get_translate_loc function, then at the start, generate the translate numbers to get every square within vision of a particular location, then just call that for each ant location and mark it as visible
2011-07-24T01:29:09  <antimatroid> to* have
2011-07-24T01:29:36  <mleise> I use that in my bot but what would the maximum memory use be?
2011-07-24T01:29:55  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-07-24T01:30:08  <mleise> how much RAM will this consume at max.
2011-07-24T01:30:08  <antimatroid> i wouldn't store vision information for every location, just the translate amounts to generate it for a location
2011-07-24T01:30:14  <mleise> ah ok
2011-07-24T01:30:54  <antimatroid> beyond that, sigh might have a faster way
2011-07-24T01:31:25  <mleise> how do you know about sigh's method?
2011-07-24T01:31:55  <sigh> my method for what?
2011-07-24T01:32:03  <antimatroid> because i was around when he found the error with searching from all ants simultaneously with euclidean and know he did waht the engine is using
2011-07-24T01:32:08  <antimatroid> sigh: calculating vision information
2011-07-24T01:32:23  <sigh> ah, i see
2011-07-24T01:32:28  <sigh> what language?
2011-07-24T01:32:33  <mleise> JavaScript :D
2011-07-24T01:33:24  * mleise should really not render full 2400x2400 pixel rgba bitmaps when zoomed in
2011-07-24T01:33:48  <sigh> you might want to look at how the engine does it, it might be appropriate
2011-07-24T01:33:57  <sigh> for the visualiser, where you have full state info
2011-07-24T01:36:24  <mleise> sigh: Deltas... I have a deja vu
2011-07-24T01:37:13  <mleise> I thought, if I talk about my vision code, people will propose deltas and then I'll have to say that my code is ... too flexible for deltas :p

2011-07-24T01:38:02  <mleise> I don't imply that ants move exaclty one square per turn in one of 4 directions
2011-07-24T01:41:07  <antimatroid> i'm interested in people writing code for luring enemy ants to places that you want
2011-07-24T01:41:41  <antimatroid> either leading them with a lone ant away from your "hive/base/whatever" or luring them in to one ant in the middle of a trap where your ants come in from outside the enemies vision on all sides
2011-07-24T01:43:29  <mleise> btw, I improved the attack lines a bit. They are now based on the final positions of the ants in the current turn and are visible during the whole turn. Often when one turn ends the lines are immediatly replaced by new ones which makes the ants look really busy.

2011-07-24T06:02:38  <humanfromearth> do coroutines(microthreads, fibers..) count as threads?
2011-07-24T06:03:03  <humanfromearth> specifically goroutines
2011-07-24T06:21:41  <antimatroid> i don't know much about that kind of stuff, green threads whatever they are are allowed
2011-07-24T06:21:51  <antimatroid> if that helps, great, otherwise no idea sorry :)
2011-07-24T06:28:58  <humanfromearth> antimatroid: I don't know about the design of goroutines. Here is a short definition: a function executing in parallel with other goroutines in the same address space.
2011-07-24T06:29:08  <humanfromearth> Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should block, such as while waiting for I/O, others continue to run. Their design hides many of the complexities of thread creation and management.
2011-07-24T06:29:29  <antimatroid> i don't really know anything to help you sorry, hopefully someone else will come along at some point who knows more

2011-07-24T06:37:09  <mcstar> it wont work if it uses multiple os level threads
2011-07-24T06:38:34  <mcstar> i guess you can somehow tune your system to not spawn other threads than a main one
2011-07-24T06:38:50  <mcstar> but you will use any parallel speedups of course

2011-07-24T06:48:34  <humanfromearth> mcstar: by default it uses just one. It can be adjusted by setting GOMAXPROCS to something bigger than 1. So if I use the default setting I should be fine?

2011-07-24T09:39:32  <jmcarthur> we could use something like cpulimit to limit the percent of cpu that bots can use. that would mean we don't have to have that rule about threads anymore
2011-07-24T09:40:47  <jmcarthur> this would mean that a process can only use up to one cpu's worth of resources: cpulimit <pid> -l 100
2011-07-24T09:41:00  <jmcarthur> hmm, i guess multithreading could still interfere with other bots though
2011-07-24T09:41:21  <jmcarthur> i guess that shoots down the idea then
2011-07-24T09:42:25  <jmcarthur> oh, a better alternative:
2011-07-24T09:42:30  <jmcarthur> taskset
2011-07-24T09:42:39  <jmcarthur> just assign a process to a particular core
2011-07-24T09:57:50  <humanfromearth> jmcarthur: I think that running bots on the server should be optional. Someone should be able to use it's own machine to run the bot. Like tcpserver for planet wars last year.
2011-07-24T10:00:14  <humanfromearth> this reduces a number of security concerns and makes the bot creators more free to use different techniques such as running a bot on a cluster, however that may be unfair for others that don't have a 'cluster'.
2011-07-24T10:06:42  <jbroman> humanfromearth: This probably gives an unfair advantage to people with more expensive computing hardware.
2011-07-24T10:07:01  <humanfromearth> jbroman: Yes, I pointed that out
2011-07-24T10:07:08  <humanfromearth> can someone take a look at my pull request? It solves a number of issues.
2011-07-24T10:08:42  <jmcarthur> it would also give an unfair advantage to people with really bad internet connections
2011-07-24T10:08:48  <jmcarthur> err
2011-07-24T10:08:51  <jmcarthur> disadvantage
2011-07-24T10:09:28  <jmcarthur> well i guess they could opt for the server if they wanted, but it probably wouldn't be worth it to support *two* ways to compete
2011-07-24T10:10:33  <humanfromearth> you're right, but then again.. 2mb zip files + 1 process/thread is very limiting in these days
2011-07-24T10:11:35  <_flag> It's less limiting then ever before. What do you mean?
2011-07-24T10:12:02  <_flag> It's millions and millions of instructions
2011-07-24T10:12:40  <humanfromearth> Maybe not all of them are instructions, maybe some are statistical data
2011-07-24T10:13:01  <_flag> I'm talking about the process/thread thing
2011-07-24T10:13:46  <_flag> I'm pretty sure you can create files within your directory and collect data on the server anyway (but I'm not 100% sure)
2011-07-24T10:14:03  <humanfromearth> _flag: you cannot write files on the server
2011-07-24T10:14:08  <humanfromearth> it's in the rulles
2011-07-24T10:14:33  <_flag> Then how were people able to create learning algorithms last contest?
2011-07-24T10:14:47  <humanfromearth> they didn't
2011-07-24T10:14:49  <humanfromearth> >)
2011-07-24T10:14:56  <_flag> They did
2011-07-24T10:15:27  <humanfromearth> maybe locally and then uploaded the results on the server, but you can't write files on the server.. you can just read them.
2011-07-24T10:15:53  <_flag> Hmmm..., I guess they must've used the tcp server to configure it
2011-07-24T10:16:17  <humanfromearth> probably, but during the actual contest tcpserver was not used
2011-07-24T10:16:38  <humanfromearth> see how people won last 2 times
2011-07-24T10:16:56  <_flag> All the games are played on the server, yes
2011-07-24T10:17:05  <humanfromearth> no GA, neural nets..
2011-07-24T10:17:07  <_flag> But everyone used the tcp server to test changes
2011-07-24T10:17:49  <humanfromearth> maybe people just don't know how to code them, or they didn't apply.. I'm not an expert myself..
2011-07-24T10:19:16  <_flag> I'm not sure how those would apply to either PlanetWars or Tron
2011-07-24T10:19:16  <humanfromearth> it still seems rather strange that standard AI stuff didn't help much
2011-07-24T10:21:38  <humanfromearth> but maybe, just maybe it's related to the fact that you can't really run a massively parallel bot on the contest server
2011-07-24T10:22:38  <humanfromearth> so that being the limitation people resorted to heuristic stuff
2011-07-24T10:22:46  <humanfromearth> I'm just speculating here...
2011-07-24T10:24:46  <_flag> I don't think people are limiting themselves to heuristic stuff
2011-07-24T10:25:26  <_flag> You couldn't really describe the strategies currently being employed on the server as "heuristic stuff"
2011-07-24T10:26:00  <_flag> Second, I don't think the idea is to suck as much processing power as possible, it's to be efficiant
2011-07-24T10:26:34  <_flag> It adds an extra constraint on the competition
2011-07-24T10:27:31  <jmcarthur> humanfromearth: for the record, zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2, and tar.xz are all supported now
2011-07-24T10:27:45  <jmcarthur> humanfromearth: so you can squeeze in quite a bit of stuff, especially with xz
2011-07-24T10:28:35  <jmcarthur> _flag: the learning bots just learned form replays available on the web site
2011-07-24T10:28:39  <jmcarthur> *from replays
2011-07-24T10:30:45  <jmcarthur> i'd be fine with allowing multithreading if we divided the time limit by the number of cores and gave each bot relatively exclusive access to machine resources, one at a time
2011-07-24T10:30:45  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-07-24T10:30:55  <jmcarthur> but then you're disadvantaged if you *don't* use parallelism
2011-07-24T10:31:18  <jmcarthur> and it turns the contest into a bit more of an efficiency contest, really
2011-07-24T10:32:20  <jmcarthur> arguably, though, since multicore is the modern thing, there isn't much harm in favoring modern optimizations like parallelism
2011-07-24T10:32:37  <jmcarthur> it also disadvantages some languages yet further though
2011-07-24T10:32:48  <jmcarthur> due to global locks and such that some runtimes have
2011-07-24T10:33:00  <humanfromearth> jmcarthur: you mean python?
2011-07-24T10:33:35  <jmcarthur> that would be an example, yeah
2011-07-24T10:33:48  <jmcarthur> i mean, you could always spawn multiple processes, but that kind of sucks
2011-07-24T10:34:23  <humanfromearth> to be more exact: cpython.. pypy would be a good alternative for that problem
2011-07-24T10:34:28  <jmcarthur> sure
2011-07-24T10:34:46  <jmcarthur> ocaml is another example. you can use multiple OS threads in ocaml, but it comes with risks due to the way the GC works
2011-07-24T10:36:09  <humanfromearth> jmcarthur: I think you're missing the point here.. it's not a language contest.. it's about making clever bots
2011-07-24T10:36:30  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-07-24T10:36:43  <humanfromearth> so if a language is disadvantaged then quite simply.. don't use it
2011-07-24T10:36:57  <humanfromearth> use something else that does the job
2011-07-24T10:37:21  <jmcarthur> i agree, but the majority may not
2011-07-24T10:38:19  <jmcarthur> but to further drive home our mutual agreement, languages *already* impose significant advantages/disadvantages on your, depending on the kind of AI you are writing
2011-07-24T10:38:24  <jmcarthur> *on you
2011-07-24T10:39:07  <humanfromearth> jmcarthur: :) true
2011-07-24T10:39:24  <jmcarthur> also, we want to attract programmers with all kinds of backgrounds
2011-07-24T10:40:23  <jmcarthur> many might not have much experience with C++. since the *main* point is to write good AI instead of competing in a number crunching contest, it's nice to eliminate language inadequacies when we can, at least
2011-07-24T10:40:39  <jmcarthur> otherwise we would just make everybody use fortran ;)
2011-07-24T10:41:03  <humanfromearth> jmcarthur: you wouldn't have a contest then..
2011-07-24T10:41:24  <jmcarthur> well, you would, but it wouldn't be an AI contest
2011-07-24T10:41:48  <jmcarthur> or maybe i'm misinterpreting what you are saying
2011-07-24T10:42:26  <humanfromearth> not many young people know fortran these days...
2011-07-24T10:42:40  <jmcarthur> my point is that if we design the contest to balance the different languages as much as possible then we will have a much greater turnout, that's all
2011-07-24T10:42:57  <jmcarthur> i think you are agreeing with me without realizing it
2011-07-24T10:44:09  <jmcarthur> all that said, i think parallelism is fun and i wish we were allowed to use it
2011-07-24T10:44:27  <jmcarthur> it's just that i see that there are some good reasons not to allow it
2011-07-24T10:46:21  <humanfromearth> jmcarthur: and I think that's a big limitation, I guess what I wanted to ask was how decides this?

2011-07-24T10:54:48  <jmcarthur> overall i see that as a positive, but it does have the downside that you never know who to talk to about various issues, and everybody is afraid to make certain kinds of major decisions

2011-07-24T11:01:57  <humanfromearth> that's right

2011-07-24T15:16:09  <mcstar> yeah, several weeks ago it solved itself

2011-07-24T17:49:12  <janzert> mleise amstan the output from the scheduler test started a while back http://pastebin.com/w8hc7yHy
2011-07-24T17:49:34  <janzert> no time stamps though so can't tell if they all happened in one burst or not
2011-07-24T17:49:47  <mleise> Shame on me.
2011-07-24T17:50:18  <janzert> I do know when I checked it the first couple times there had been no output though
2011-07-24T17:50:55  <mleise> At least there are no extreme values. That is good to know.
2011-07-24T17:51:12  <amstan> janzert: didn't i run it with time?
2011-07-24T17:51:13  <janzert> also I didn't stop it so it is still running
2011-07-24T17:51:27  <amstan> janzert: i think i forgot
2011-07-24T17:51:33  <janzert> doesn't appear to be
2011-07-24T17:51:41  <janzert> but that wouldn't help anything here anyway
2011-07-24T17:51:46  <amstan> janzert: can you restart it with time?
2011-07-24T17:51:58  <amstan> janzert: would be nice to know how many time errors we have in a time period
2011-07-24T17:52:23  <mleise> I can add time and date to the lines if you want
2011-07-24T17:52:23  <janzert> a timestamp per line would be much better
2011-07-24T17:52:28  * janzert nods
2011-07-24T17:52:29  <amstan> mleise: yes
2011-07-24T17:52:31  <mleise> :p
2011-07-24T17:52:39  <mleise> any ideas on the timestamp format?
2011-07-24T17:52:50  <amstan> mleise: just get the default one
2011-07-24T17:53:17  <janzert> date and time down to the millisecond would be great
2011-07-24T17:53:29  <janzert> exact format doesn't matter
2011-07-24T17:53:48  <mleise> the millisecond after the delay, ok
2011-07-24T17:53:52  <janzert> just down to the second is really going to be enough of course
2011-07-24T17:55:08  <mleise> I just have to look up date formatting...
