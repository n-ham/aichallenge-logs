2011-07-30T00:43:42  <agweber> I love you all
2011-07-30T00:45:03  <agweber> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/website/profile_submissions_widget.php
2011-07-30T00:45:20  <agweber> On line 107, could you not just add width=# to fix the expanding of the table due to errors?
2011-07-30T00:46:34  <agweber> Or would it be better/consistent to do this through the stylesheets
2011-07-30T00:46:35  <amstan> agweber: that means you have to hardcode the width in pixels
2011-07-30T00:46:44  <amstan> yes, there's a styleshoot
2011-07-30T00:46:47  <amstan> sheet*
2011-07-30T00:46:56  <amstan> but table's already width: 100%;
2011-07-30T00:47:17  <agweber> And the page isn't dynamically wide
2011-07-30T00:47:19  <amstan> there seems to be another thing overriding
2011-07-30T00:47:27  <amstan> ?
2011-07-30T00:47:46  <agweber> If you adjust the width of your window, pages with dynamically adjusting layouts will adjust with your window
2011-07-30T00:48:01  <agweber> I don't know the proper terms for such things
2011-07-30T00:48:13  <agweber> But hard-coding that with the current page setup wouldn't make a difference
2011-07-30T00:48:30  <amstan> yes, the only thing that's fixed is the columns
2011-07-30T00:48:36  <amstan> everything else is relative to that
2011-07-30T00:48:50  <amstan> no children should be hardcoded
2011-07-30T00:49:09  <amstan> so it's easy to change if you want to change stuff
2011-07-30T00:49:23  <amstan> anyway.. i can take a look with an inspector
2011-07-30T00:49:25  <amstan> but after i sleep
2011-07-30T00:49:32  <agweber> Hrmm... So it's something that's preventing the table from sticking to 100%.... grah
2011-07-30T00:49:38  <agweber> Understandable
2011-07-30T00:49:44  <amstan> probably a hardcoded width inside
2011-07-30T00:49:48  <amstan> get firebug and see
2011-07-30T01:09:20  <agweber> found the problem

2011-07-30T06:59:53  <ohCrivens> any devs around?
2011-07-30T07:03:51  <antimatroid1> depends what the problem is?
2011-07-30T07:04:47  <ohCrivens> is games ending prematurely a known issue? all bots are still eating food and moving around, but game still ends at turn 150 and the ranks get based on score. Ant count being 0 / 15 / 13 so that doesnt exactly count as 66% either. At a quick glance, theres roughly 100 food tiles on the map on start so that definitely counts as 66% and without good spreading, its not possible to decrease the amount considering the spawn rate
2011-07-30T07:05:05  <ohCrivens> not a bug but perhaps an issue in game rules
2011-07-30T07:06:24  <antimatroid1> there is something ending games early if it looks like the game is going nowhere, but i'm not sure what they are exactly sorry
2011-07-30T07:06:37  <ohCrivens> its a 179x164 map with 3 players
2011-07-30T07:06:42  <antimatroid1> i don't think i can be much help, amstan might be more helpful later
2011-07-30T07:06:45  <ohCrivens> afaik its the 66% control rule
2011-07-30T07:06:55  <ohCrivens> some maps start with an insane amount of food
2011-07-30T07:07:51  <ohCrivens> and its impossible to collect enough food to get food's control under 66% without a repelling spread in all teams
2011-07-30T07:08:02  <ohCrivens> I mean, in big maps with a few teams

2011-07-30T19:25:32  <Hjax> is the leaderboard messed up or are a lot of accounts missing?
2011-07-30T19:26:47  <amstan> idk, i don't spend that much time on the leaderboards
2011-07-30T19:27:28  <amstan> yeah, seems like there's less ppl
2011-07-30T19:27:46  <Hjax> there used to be a few pages, now there is only one

2011-07-30T19:34:01  <amstan> maybe janzert activated the timeout disqualifications

2011-07-30T20:30:41  <amstan> wtf?
2011-07-30T20:31:07  <amstan> that's not a timeout issue then
2011-07-30T20:32:10  <amstan> Hjax: when did this happen?
2011-07-30T20:32:35  <Hjax> just now, ive been too busy irl to do anything on AI challenge
2011-07-30T20:32:58  <Hjax> in fact my tests of the starter bots disappeared too
2011-07-30T20:33:08  <amstan> Hjax: do you have a link to your account page?
2011-07-30T20:33:34  <Hjax> my old one?
2011-07-30T20:33:39  <amstan> yes
2011-07-30T20:34:36  <Hjax> i made one of the first beta accounts, i should find one by playing with the profile url, 1 sec
2011-07-30T20:35:27  <amstan> mysql> select * from user where username like "Hjax";
2011-07-30T20:35:28  <amstan> Empty set (0.00 sec)
2011-07-30T20:35:42  <amstan> it would help to know at least the username
2011-07-30T20:36:25  <Hjax> one was _Hjax_ the underscores were to make it long enough
2011-07-30T20:36:56  <amstan> there.. fixed the rankings table
2011-07-30T20:37:07  <amstan> it was just the leaderboard script that crashed
2011-07-30T20:37:38  <amstan> Hjax: 10
2011-07-30T20:38:01  <Hjax> yeah, thats what i thought it was, i couldnt check because the server stopper responding
2011-07-30T20:38:04  <amstan> Hjax: maybe you forgot your pass or something
2011-07-30T20:38:12  <Hjax> let me see
2011-07-30T20:38:18  <amstan> Hjax: umm.. i could copy the pass from your new account
2011-07-30T20:38:44  <Hjax> could you get me a copy of my bot? i think i lost it
2011-07-30T20:39:23  <amstan> Hjax: send me your new user id
2011-07-30T20:39:31  <amstan> and tell me what number you have in your email to verify
2011-07-30T20:40:38  <Hjax> the site is being slow, 1 sec
2011-07-30T20:41:12  <amstan> Hjax: don't load the rankings page, it'll kill it
2011-07-30T20:41:29  <Hjax> im trying to log in with my new account, 1 sec
2011-07-30T20:41:30  <amstan> or at least the username.. i can do with that
2011-07-30T20:42:03  <Hjax> TheHjax is the new one, _Hjax_ is the old one
2011-07-30T20:42:38  <amstan> Hjax: and the number form the email address you used to make the first account?

2011-07-30T21:39:45  <amstan> sure..
2011-07-30T21:39:58  <amstan> so.. i'm trying to make this pov project
2011-07-30T21:40:11  <amstan> i got to the point where you can see letters if you can flick the board a lot
2011-07-30T21:40:26  <amstan> but i forgot that they'll also show backwards too when i move the board back
2011-07-30T21:40:46  <amstan> so i still have to implement the accelerometed data stuff, so it'll show the letters backwards on the down stroke
2011-07-30T21:42:12  * Hjax pulls hair out
2011-07-30T21:42:23  <Hjax> speak 15 year old please :)

2011-07-30T21:44:30  <amstan> except mine doesn't spin
2011-07-30T21:44:36  <amstan> mine is just supposed to move laterarly
2011-07-30T21:45:56  <Hjax> but when it returns to the original position its picture is getting messed up right? thats why spinning is more effective
2011-07-30T21:46:07  <amstan> well.. spinning only moves it one way
2011-07-30T21:46:22  <amstan> but when i move it left and right with my hand, i have to move it back too
2011-07-30T21:46:34  <amstan> so when i move it toward the left everything is backwards

2011-07-30T21:56:12  <hjax> wait, i misread what you wrote
2011-07-30T21:57:20  <hjax> wasnt it your idea to make a bot on ants beta that tried to spell words?
