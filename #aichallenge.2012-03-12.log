2012-03-12T10:56:30  <thestinger> I did that first
2012-03-12T10:57:02  <mcstar> i finished them on saturday or friday i dont remember
2012-03-12T10:57:12  <thestinger> I haven't touched the problem set thing though
2012-03-12T10:57:21  <mcstar> ah yeah
2012-03-12T10:57:31  <mcstar> did those on saturday
2012-03-12T10:57:40  <mcstar> and the progrmaming problems on firday
2012-03-12T10:58:12  <mcstar> thestinger: i made lisp fast
2012-03-12T10:58:22  <mcstar> it was around 20 seconds first
2012-03-12T10:58:23  <thestinger> what language did you do the first question in?
2012-03-12T10:58:43  <mcstar> the cipher?
2012-03-12T10:58:47  <mcstar> python
2012-03-12T10:58:56  <mcstar> cause it was easy to decode the string in it
2012-03-12T10:59:02  <mcstar> i mean hexa to ascii
2012-03-12T10:59:13  <thestinger> yeah
2012-03-12T10:59:20  <mcstar> python3 doesnt recognixe it though
2012-03-12T11:00:18  <thestinger> python3 cleans up strings
2012-03-12T11:00:32  <thestinger> "" is str (a string of unicode codepoints)
2012-03-12T11:00:56  <mcstar> i mean the .decode() method
2012-03-12T11:01:06  <thestinger> http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/binascii.html#binascii.b2a_hex
2012-03-12T11:01:30  <mcstar> ok
2012-03-12T11:01:32  <thestinger> mcstar: .decode is a method on bytes, but the hex codec is gone because it doesn't make sense
2012-03-12T11:01:36  <mcstar> i dont care much to be honest :)
2012-03-12T11:02:13  <mcstar> thestinger: so did you see that the recursive 'remainder' function in c actually makes things fater?
2012-03-12T11:02:16  <mcstar> faster*
2012-03-12T11:02:29  <mcstar> and in pypy the loop is very fast, and the modulo slows everything down
2012-03-12T11:03:04  <thestinger> gcc and llvm can both do TCO
2012-03-12T11:03:43  <mcstar> so?
2012-03-12T11:04:17  <mcstar> i'd expect a modulo function to be as fast as that
2012-03-12T11:05:22  <thestinger> ./crypto  1.25s user 0.00s system 99% cpu 1.253 total
2012-03-12T11:05:25  <thestinger> ./file  1.24s user 0.00s system 99% cpu 1.245 total
2012-03-12T11:05:28  <thestinger> same speed
2012-03-12T11:05:33  <thestinger> the old one and the new one
2012-03-12T11:05:39  <thestinger> gave them random names :P
2012-03-12T11:06:20  <mcstar> whats the difference?

2012-03-12T11:06:57  <thestinger> oh
2012-03-12T11:07:02  <mcstar> as you can see there are several codes in the code
2012-03-12T11:07:07  <mcstar> paste*
2012-03-12T11:07:14  <mcstar> i mean codepaths
2012-03-12T11:07:19  <mcstar> just need to uncomment them

2012-03-12T11:12:32  <mcstar> usually i'd expect a factor of 4 at least
2012-03-12T11:13:01  <thestinger> mcstar: I'm on my laptop atm
2012-03-12T11:13:07  <mcstar> hah
2012-03-12T11:13:48  <thestinger> TCO kicks in so there isn't actually recursion going on
2012-03-12T11:14:16  <thestinger> weird that it's faster though
2012-03-12T11:14:20  <thestinger> not sure I understand at all
2012-03-12T11:14:37  <mcstar> in pypy the same 'mymod' function slows it down
2012-03-12T11:14:42  <mcstar> like 20secs again
2012-03-12T11:15:00  <thestinger> mcstar: btw, ordering can matter for that
2012-03-12T11:15:24  <thestinger> `5 + a' vs `a + 5'
2012-03-12T11:15:40  <thestinger> due to how overloads work in python
2012-03-12T11:15:51  <mcstar> what?
2012-03-12T11:15:53  <mcstar> which is better?
2012-03-12T11:15:57  <mcstar> 5 + a
2012-03-12T11:16:01  <thestinger> yes
2012-03-12T11:16:11  <mcstar> but thats pypy
2012-03-12T11:16:14  <mcstar> shouldnt matter
2012-03-12T11:16:19  <mcstar> the jit must unbox it
2012-03-12T11:16:19  <thestinger> well cpython will always do a lookup for a + 5
2012-03-12T11:16:35  <thestinger> pypy is smart, but not necessarily that smart
2012-03-12T11:16:40  <mcstar> i think it is
2012-03-12T11:16:45  <thestinger> you can change the methods at runtime, it has to figure out you aren't doing that
2012-03-12T11:16:53  <thestinger> so it has to run through the code at least once

2012-03-12T11:20:18  <rwest> syntax of that language makes me want to slit my wrists
2012-03-12T11:20:33  <thestinger> oh, that's like J?
2012-03-12T11:20:53  <rwest> Never seen J, but it's an academic array language
2012-03-12T11:21:03  <thestinger> point free haskell is pretty hard to read too if you aren't used to it
2012-03-12T11:21:09  <rwest> for parallel programming
2012-03-12T11:21:14  <rwest> and it's a nightmare to read
2012-03-12T11:21:26  <rwest> especially since there are almost no docs
2012-03-12T11:21:34  <rwest> and I had to learn it by reading others code
2012-03-12T11:21:51  <rwest> it has no form too
2012-03-12T11:21:55  <rwest> so spacing is eratic
2012-03-12T11:21:57  <rwest> and ugh
2012-03-12T11:22:41  <rwest> however, it's pretty powerful lol
2012-03-12T11:22:49  <rwest> and compiles down to C with MPI
2012-03-12T11:25:27  <mcstar> then why not write c with mpi?
2012-03-12T11:26:20  <rwest> We did
2012-03-12T11:26:22  <rwest> it was for a class
2012-03-12T11:26:25  <rwest> we did it in both
2012-03-12T11:26:33  <rwest> ZPL code was so much easier for a lot of things
2012-03-12T11:26:38  <rwest> but learning it was a bitch
2012-03-12T11:27:16  <rwest> Array languages are easy to parallelize

2012-03-12T11:38:21  <mcstar> why?
2012-03-12T11:38:32  <mcstar> everything depends on the problem
2012-03-12T11:38:45  <mcstar> if some problem is easy to decompose, you can do it easily in any language
2012-03-12T11:39:01  <mcstar> array programming languages just give you some better primitives to operate with
2012-03-12T11:39:08  <mcstar> (often hide them)
2012-03-12T11:39:16  <mcstar> i mean they just work
2012-03-12T11:39:27  <mcstar> the problem is with the problem at ahnd

2012-03-12T14:31:49  <rwest> ugh do I hate trying to fix broken classes without breaking backwards compatibility
2012-03-12T14:32:04  <rwest> People are gonna look at my code and just facepalm
2012-03-12T14:32:52  <rwest> who writes a JSON document writer that doesn't support arrays?
2012-03-12T14:33:48  <mcstar> i read about json, it is pretty simple
2012-03-12T14:34:06  <rwest> it is, unless it's done wrong lol
2012-03-12T14:36:52  <rwest> I don't even know if this code is possible to write this way
2012-03-12T14:36:59  <rwest> I am using an array of references to references
2012-03-12T14:37:06  <rwest> to get around leaving it backwards compatible
2012-03-12T14:39:09  <rwest> nope didn't think so
2012-03-12T14:40:04  <mcstar> java?
2012-03-12T14:40:09  <rwest> php
2012-03-12T14:40:23  <rwest> basically I need to build an arbitrary depth array
2012-03-12T14:40:35  <mcstar> i not sure about this, but in c++ you have to initialize references, could that be the problem?
2012-03-12T14:40:35  <rwest> well it's basically a stack
2012-03-12T14:40:41  <rwest> no
2012-03-12T14:40:53  <rwest> I was basically doing references to references
2012-03-12T14:41:00  <rwest> it doesn't work and was ugly anyway
2012-03-12T14:41:07  <rwest> gotta think of a better way
2012-03-12T14:41:18  <mcstar> go for it
2012-03-12T14:41:34  <mcstar> meanwhile i just say that my handwriting is ugly

2012-03-12T19:10:22  <IAPepito> why registration is closed? Can I still download and make my own strategies for the next competition?
2012-03-12T19:10:37  <IAPepito> is there any server to test my strategy with other people?
2012-03-12T19:10:52  <mcstar> contest ended long ago
2012-03-12T19:11:00  <IAPepito> (actually is not just one question)
2012-03-12T19:11:08  <mcstar> that particular contest will not be repeated again

2012-03-12T19:13:23  <mcstar> you download the script, and you can run your bot with it
2012-03-12T19:13:28  <mcstar> against other connected bots
2012-03-12T19:13:40  <mcstar> but now there are a lot of quality bot source code available
2012-03-12T19:13:43  <mcstar> so you cn play locally
2012-03-12T19:15:09  <IAPepito> mcstar: can you provide me some interesting link?
2012-03-12T19:15:53  <mcstar> try googling for it
2012-03-12T19:16:26  <mcstar> these people released their code: xathis a1k0n antimatroid codetiger
2012-03-12T19:16:37  <mcstar> there are more
2012-03-12T19:16:41  <mcstar> i just done remember
2012-03-12T19:16:46  <IAPepito> do you play just IAChallange or is there some other interesting IA challenge?
