2011-11-16T00:01:00  <bmh> bugger. my old professor pulled down his lecture notes
2011-11-16T00:01:41  <bmh> Is there a cheaper way to do distance queries versus paths?
2011-11-16T00:02:36  <a1k0n> they are one in the same as far as i am concerned
2011-11-16T00:03:26  <bmh> it might be possible to get cheaper approximate distance queries with a single multi-source BFS
2011-11-16T00:06:53  <a1k0n> how is that approximate?
2011-11-16T00:07:46  <bmh> because I'm interested in all pairs, not just the pairs I'm BFSing from

2011-11-16T00:11:20  <bmh> oh. duh. This goes back to an earlier idea. I think I can exploit unit-ness and manhattan-ness and planarity to get exact all pairs queries with something like O(n^2) preprocessing work

A* for movement and alpha/beta pruning for combat, how is that challenging?", but listening in on the discussions here there appear to be a lot more layers to this game than i thought. i'm still waiting for someone to use combat teams to sneak up on enemy groups from behind ;)
2011-11-16T04:16:44  <bqf> (to break up formations, that is.)
2011-11-16T04:17:01  <digger3> bqf: don't forget to let you ant WALK insteadof of RUN for reduced sound footprint
2011-11-16T04:17:49  <digger3> bqf: biggest issue with state-space exploration is scalability. That drives the search for heuristics
2011-11-16T04:20:14  <bqf> digger3: i'm not actually writing a bot right now, so my ants are as stealthy as can be.
2011-11-16T04:20:23  <bqf> and yes, the search space gets huge very fast. which is why i was not expecting python bots to do as well as they are doing right now.

2011-11-16T04:42:43  <Nealefelaen> ... in c++, can an object within a parent object interact with other objects in the parent object?
2011-11-16T04:43:07  <Zao> Nealefelaen: Not implicitly.
2011-11-16T04:43:27  <Nealefelaen> dang =)
2011-11-16T04:43:50  <Zao> Nealefelaen: It needs a pointer to the parent, and if not in C++11, it needs to have sufficient access to the members it wishes to touch.
2011-11-16T04:44:25  <Zao> (in C++11 nested classes are allowed to touch anything in their parent type (through an explicit pointer/reference, of course))
2011-11-16T04:44:50  <Nealefelaen> cheers
2011-11-16T04:45:08  <Zao> Nealefelaen: You couldn't magically access your parent from a nested class as the instance of the nested class is not necessarily a member of an instance of the class it's defined in.
2011-11-16T04:45:23  <Zao> I can say  Foo::Bar b; without ever having a Foo instance.
2011-11-16T04:45:48  <Nealefelaen> everything is public, so that isn't a concern, I just have to pass in a reference to the parent object to the children objects...
2011-11-16T04:47:00  <Nealefelaen> I might just pass the addresses of the variables in to the functions that need them

2011-11-16T06:29:39  <Nealefelaen> making it dynamic and the ants able to switch classes situationally...
2011-11-16T06:31:16  <HaraKiri> hm yea they should be. my ants are considering every order all the time, so no specific classes. but it's not easy to weigh the possible orders against all others and especially combine them

2011-11-16T07:47:30  <bugnuts2> the throughput on tcpants.com is about 2x as high as fluxid plus the graphs and highlighting are nice
2011-11-16T07:48:07  <bugnuts2> downside is because there are only a few bots you only end up on 1-1 matches
2011-11-16T07:48:17  <digger3> high enough throughput for evolutionary algorithms? ;p
2011-11-16T07:48:47  <lericson> :D
2011-11-16T07:49:02  <lericson> that would be something
2011-11-16T07:49:30  <digger3> pretty easy too, for example when optimising particular values
2011-11-16T07:49:57  <digger3> but you would require a good sampling of various bots otherwise you'd overfit on a particular bot

2011-11-16T08:48:42  <sir_macelon> Garf: I should get the logs with previous turn times, but I don't get any, seems there is a bug with providing it
2011-11-16T08:49:23  <sir_macelon> amstan: so is there any way I could see those logs?
2011-11-16T08:50:16  <amstan> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/508643/
2011-11-16T08:50:52  <retybok> You're supposed to get debug information when your bug crashes? Where is that info supposed to be?
2011-11-16T08:51:35  <sir_macelon> retybok: under the game visualization
2011-11-16T08:51:53  <lericson> what.
2011-11-16T08:52:04  <retybok> I crashed in this game (http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=92518&user=4117), but I didn't get any info
2011-11-16T08:52:17  <retybok> Is it limited to a few languages?
2011-11-16T08:52:59  <sir_macelon> retybok: no, it was working previously, I am also not getting it any more, someone had broke it
2011-11-16T08:53:08  <amstan> sir_macelon: when did it work? i could do a revert
2011-11-16T08:53:43  <retybok> ok, thanks. I had always assumed that this was on purpose, that submitting a robust bot was part of the challenge :)
2011-11-16T08:53:50  <amstan> nov 2 is the last commit in that file
2011-11-16T08:54:09  <sir_macelon> amstan: I don't remember, but couple of months ago
2011-11-16T08:54:30  <amstan> ... we launched last month
2011-11-16T08:54:40  <sir_macelon> amstan: I didn't care about it for a long time, but I've noticed it pretty long time ago now
2011-11-16T08:54:52  <sir_macelon> amstan: it worked in beta
2011-11-16T08:55:16  <sir_macelon> amstan: maybe we should ask the involved dev?
2011-11-16T08:55:43  <amstan> sir_macelon: ok, let me try this
2011-11-16T08:56:16  <pairofdice> Massive breakage is soon to follow
2011-11-16T08:57:19  <mikewintermute> Any people know what this bit of code does in Ants.java? http://pastebin.com/eAaEVszD

2011-11-16T08:58:23  <sir_macelon> amstan: I don't get what do you mean
2011-11-16T08:58:28  <amstan> sir_macelon: did anything change?
2011-11-16T08:59:30  <sir_macelon> amstan: yes, previously, when you timed out or crashed you got the first and last 512B of stderr printed out under the game
2011-11-16T08:59:49  <amstan> sir_macelon: i'm talking about now
2011-11-16T08:59:51  <sir_macelon> amstan: and you didn't have to be logged in to see it, anyone could see it
2011-11-16T08:59:52  <amstan> i just made a change
2011-11-16T09:00:35  <sir_macelon> amstan: no, still the same
2011-11-16T09:00:51  <sir_macelon> amstan: probably you have to merge the change
2011-11-16T09:01:07  <amstan> sir_macelon: now?
2011-11-16T09:02:07  <sir_macelon> amstan: still nothing... :(
2011-11-16T09:02:43  <amstan> ok, nvm then
2011-11-16T09:02:49  <amstan> i'll just leave the issue up
2011-11-16T09:03:59  <sir_macelon> amstan: you should have some test account to test this
2011-11-16T09:06:13  <amstan> sir_macelon: i do, but i don't have any games on mine

2011-11-16T09:07:11  <sir_macelon> amstan: you could just try to upload a bot that either times out or crashes and writes something to stderr before
2011-11-16T09:08:15  <sir_macelon> amstan: anyway I would be very much asking to fix this soon or I will have to ask admins for my bots debug output
2011-11-16T09:08:27  <sir_macelon> amstan: is it a big issue?
2011-11-16T09:09:09  <amstan> you'll have to wait for mcleopold to fix this

2011-11-16T11:09:56  <thestinger> heh, using multi-source BFS to make my distance map for exploration is over 70x faster than how I do it now (adding each target with a BFS, but stopping when values would be higher or equal to the existing ones)
2011-11-16T11:10:08  <thestinger> all speed problems solved! :)
2011-11-16T11:10:31  <Conorach> nice :)

2011-11-16T11:10:34  <thestinger> and it creates the same 2d array all the time, I ran a few games and checked each time to make sure
2011-11-16T11:10:44  <thestinger> well, I mean it does the exact same thing as before
2011-11-16T11:10:46  <thestinger> just 70x faster
2011-11-16T11:11:20  <a1k0n> bring it to tcpants.com, it seems to need more players
2011-11-16T11:11:22  <thestinger> takes less than 1ms to add ~7000 targets to the map (yay exploration)
2011-11-16T11:11:42  <mcstar> thats great
2011-11-16T11:12:05  <mcstar> are you doing it prallel?
2011-11-16T11:12:45  <thestinger> well, instead of marking a target as 0, putting it onto the search queue and then iterating outwards
2011-11-16T11:12:51  <thestinger> and then redoing that for each target
2011-11-16T11:13:02  <thestinger> I put them all on the search queue, mark them all as 0, then run the BFS
2011-11-16T11:13:15  <pairofdice> Yeah, that's how I do it
2011-11-16T11:13:15  <a1k0n> yes, that's the way to do multi-source bfs
2011-11-16T11:13:22  <mcstar> you add all g_vertex==m all at once?
2011-11-16T11:13:24  <a1k0n> you also don't need a priority queue at all
2011-11-16T11:13:37  <thestinger> it's just a regular queue
2011-11-16T11:14:37  <mcstar> i dont think that is optimal though
2011-11-16T11:15:03  <a1k0n> it visits each square on the map once, so it's hard to see how much more optimal it could be
2011-11-16T11:15:15  <mcstar> not the pathfinding part
2011-11-16T11:15:22  <mcstar> the result, how it assigns food to ants
2011-11-16T11:15:30  <thestinger> oh, I don't use this for food
2011-11-16T11:15:38  <thestinger> this is for exploration and swarming at hills
2011-11-16T11:15:46  <mcstar> ah k

2011-11-16T11:21:48  <Minthos> I didn't mean my defending ants (although they were brave as usual), but the two ants sneaking into tyler's base when his recruitment stopped for a moment

2011-11-16T11:33:15  <praveen_> lower sigma - indicates it has not seen much of that bot? confidence is less?
2011-11-16T11:33:18  <pairofdice> Well...
2011-11-16T11:33:28  <lorill> on the contrary
2011-11-16T11:33:35  <lorill> lower sigma => more confidence in the rank
2011-11-16T11:33:49  <lorill> so the bot is chosen more often in the matchup process if I got it right
2011-11-16T11:33:52  <mcstar> why greater than or equal?
2011-11-16T11:33:53  <praveen_> if it has more confidence, then why should he get more games?
2011-11-16T11:34:20  <Nealefelaen> amstan: I suppose it would count if it then switched the numbers?
2011-11-16T11:34:20  <lorill> to help other bots to get a credible rank ?
2011-11-16T11:34:39  <praveen_> ya possible
2011-11-16T11:34:41  <amstan> Nealefelaen: sure, but all sorting algos do that
2011-11-16T11:34:43  <aarossig> Nealefelaen: it does switch the numbers... but there is no outer loop to make it operate repeatedly

2011-11-16T11:38:10  <Nealefelaen> ... all modern computers have an equality and a move command?
2011-11-16T11:38:12  <aarossig> I once asked a question relating to assembly (don't remember the question) and somehow intel and amd were suddenly involved
2011-11-16T11:38:18  <aarossig> and we're studying microcontrollers..
2011-11-16T11:38:44  <mcstar> a cmp operation must be in every set, i think, but it isnt necessarily called cmp
2011-11-16T11:38:55  <mcstar> adn i think there are many variants of that
2011-11-16T11:39:12  <Nealefelaen> mcstar: you'd use an assembler in any case?
2011-11-16T11:39:28  <jix> if you have an instruction like substract and skip if negative or similar it's enough to be turing complete when the instruction pointer is memory mapped
2011-11-16T11:39:31  <Nealefelaen> assembly code is still a step above machine code
2011-11-16T11:39:36  <mcstar> Nealefelaen: im just talking, i dont know anything about these matters

2011-11-16T11:51:46  <Nealefelaen> there is some probability that even when you outnumber the enemy ants you will lose ants, maybe that's what this case is?

2011-11-16T11:58:43  <a1k0n> now that i've fixed this bug i wonder how much worse my bot is
2011-11-16T11:59:12  <praveen_> what happened seems right according to this - "(enemies(of ant) in range of ant) >= (enemies(of enemy) in range of enemy)"
2011-11-16T11:59:30  <mcstar> Nealefelaen: https://github.com/liquid-phynix/ants-fight/blob/master/main.hh#L78
2011-11-16T11:59:33  <Nealefelaen> so if you have to lines of ants facing each other, of say 5 ants in one line and 3 ants in the other... the 3 ants will die, but so will 3 of the 5 ants?
2011-11-16T11:59:40  <mcstar> this is the code in c++ that resolves the battle
2011-11-16T11:59:48  <mcstar> maybe its clearer

2011-11-16T12:01:13  <Minthos> thinking in terms of "focus" seems wrong
2011-11-16T12:01:25  <Minthos> the pseudocode explains everything
2011-11-16T12:01:51  <a1k0n> hm, to resubmit or not
2011-11-16T12:02:19  <Minthos> both blue ants have 2 green ants in range, and both blue ants have at least one green ant in range that has only two blue ants in range
2011-11-16T12:02:55  <Nealefelaen> ah
2011-11-16T12:03:14  <janzert> @later tell amstan yeah, I actually already had cycled the workers as of the early morning hours
2011-11-16T12:03:14  <contestbot> janzert: As you wish.
2011-11-16T12:03:41  <Nealefelaen> Minthos: and what about the one green ant that has three in range?
2011-11-16T12:04:12  <a1k0n> janzert: so do the worker nodes really cost ~0.07/cpu-hour?
2011-11-16T12:04:18  <a1k0n> what's the maximum bid?
2011-11-16T12:04:19  <Nealefelaen> I'm still reading up to the pseudo code, and the c++ code, and reassessing the screencap as well
2011-11-16T12:04:45  <Minthos> Nealefelaen: what about it? why doesn't it magically make one less blue ant die?
2011-11-16T12:05:21  <janzert> a1k0n: the maximum bid is stepped so that we're never paying more than a little over a dollar per hour
2011-11-16T12:05:54  <a1k0n> huh, what are the current prices then?  i thought it was much cheaper than $1/hour
2011-11-16T12:05:54  <Nealefelaen> so all three blues have to be attacking both greens?
2011-11-16T12:06:12  <a1k0n> oh for all machines total?
2011-11-16T12:06:24  <Nealefelaen> one less blue ant should die because one of the greens is distracted =P
2011-11-16T12:06:33  <janzert> for the workers total
2011-11-16T12:06:39  <a1k0n> i see
2011-11-16T12:06:45  * Nealefelaen goes back to reading the page explaining it
2011-11-16T12:06:57  <janzert> actually 6 workers are up but the prices just came back down from a spike
2011-11-16T12:07:01  <Minthos> Nealefelaen: yes and no - since thinking in terms of 'focus' is misleading :)
2011-11-16T12:07:02  <a1k0n> it sure would be nice if jeff could accept the money google is giving the contest
2011-11-16T12:07:03  <mcstar> Nealefelaen: scroll down till the math definition
2011-11-16T12:07:05  <janzert> so they're still initializing
2011-11-16T12:07:08  <mcstar> that is the clearest of all
2011-11-16T12:07:12  <Nealefelaen> yeah, I'm doing that =)

2011-11-16T12:19:54  <a1k0n> i hate that map so much
2011-11-16T12:20:33  <Nealefelaen> lol, your ants can't get out?
2011-11-16T12:20:53  <Nealefelaen> there they go, at turn 250 =D
2011-11-16T12:21:18  <a1k0n> i can make it so they get out but if i do then nobody stays to defend the base
2011-11-16T12:21:46  <a1k0n> e.g.: http://tcpants.com/replay.3174
2011-11-16T12:22:04  <a1k0n> need to work on that
2011-11-16T12:22:16  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-16T12:22:37  <Nealefelaen> you can't split your ants somehow?
2011-11-16T12:22:42  <Nealefelaen> some stay and some go?
2011-11-16T12:22:48  <a1k0n> the only reason they left the base on the first one was because of the incoming attack, and then they followed it back to its source
2011-11-16T12:22:56  <mcstar> Nealefelaen: he want THEM to realize they should split
2011-11-16T12:23:01  <mcstar> s
2011-11-16T12:23:11  <a1k0n> i can, just not sure what the criterion should be.
2011-11-16T12:23:16  <a1k0n> have some ideas.
2011-11-16T12:23:32  <mcstar> im goona have hill defcon level
2011-11-16T12:23:33  <Nealefelaen> defend with at least x ants?
2011-11-16T12:23:36  <mcstar> halfway implemented
2011-11-16T12:23:41  <Yexo> McLeopold: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1549 <- the scoring in that game is interesting. Manwe56v05 keeps 1 point for his hill without having any ants
2011-11-16T12:23:55  <Yexo> if he had had one ant somewhere else on the map his hill would've been razed and he would end up with 0 points
2011-11-16T12:24:05  <Yexo> but since the game stops when he has no ants left it doesn't
2011-11-16T12:24:40  <Nealefelaen> I'm hoping to have levels of safety, with defenders defending choke points that stop enemy ants getting in
2011-11-16T12:24:48  <Nealefelaen> Yexo: yeah, I've seen that in a few games
2011-11-16T12:24:56  <a1k0n> yeah that would be good on this map
2011-11-16T12:25:22  <mikewintermute> a1k0n: are you running on a different server?
2011-11-16T12:25:26  <Nealefelaen> it should be good on all maps... I just have to figure out an optimum way of detecting choke points
2011-11-16T12:25:38  <Yexo> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1564 <- please point out the chokepoints
2011-11-16T12:25:53  <a1k0n> mikewintermute: ?  i'm running on both ants.fluxid.pl ant tcpants.com
2011-11-16T12:26:19  <Nealefelaen> Yexo: there are a couple, but it's more of a box around your hill
2011-11-16T12:27:46  <Nealefelaen> the definition of a choke point is a point where your ants can survive better against an endless amount of enemy

2011-11-16T16:05:10  <Yexo> there is a single ant there, so that's alright, only in turn 152 my bot ordered that ant to go north
2011-11-16T16:05:25  <Yexo> since it doesn't expect an ant there, it assers (hence the timeout)
2011-11-16T16:07:08  <Yexo> http://paste.aichallenge.org/CoKNs/raw/ Here is the input my bot received on turn 152, partial input from turn 153 (until the offending ant) and the output from turn 152
2011-11-16T16:07:43  <Yexo> Are there other people that implemented state in their ants and have come acros this problem?

2011-11-16T17:05:16  <janzert> amstan: the problem with the archive server seemed to be a combination of planetwars being the default site and the planetwars config was accepting any url and proxying it
2011-11-16T17:05:49  <amstan> how was planetwars accepting any url?
2011-11-16T17:06:15  <janzert> you can give it a try by re-enabling the site then set the http proxy in your browser to archive.aichallenge.org port 80
2011-11-16T17:06:46  <amstan> archive? we aren't using that yet
2011-11-16T17:06:55  <janzert> then visit say whatismyip.com and you'll see your traffic is going through that server
2011-11-16T17:07:04  <janzert> or just enter the ip directly
2011-11-16T17:07:16  <janzert> it didn't matter if we were using it someone found it :)
2011-11-16T17:07:28  <amstan> i don't remember setting up planetwars on the archive server
2011-11-16T17:07:29  <janzert> probably just scanning through ip addresses
2011-11-16T17:07:41  <amstan> i kinda gave up when mysql died
2011-11-16T17:07:42  <amstan> oh well

2011-11-16T17:07:58  <janzert> it looked like the config was just copied over from what is on the main server currently
2011-11-16T17:08:01  <amstan> u_: depends on how fast we develop
2011-11-16T17:08:12  <amstan> janzert: yeah.. ok, that's not that bad then, keep it off
2011-11-16T17:08:31  <amstan> i tought you were talking about the normal setup we have now on the main server
2011-11-16T17:08:32  <janzert> I got the directories rearranged now btw

2011-11-16T18:16:56  <janzert> yeah, ec2 is having some really weird spot prices this week
2011-11-16T18:17:15  <a1k0n> isn't it cheaper to just buy an instance?
2011-11-16T18:17:26  <magiik> right now it is
2011-11-16T18:17:41  <magiik> but i usually pay like $.02 for the spot instances cuz it's cheaper most of the time
2011-11-16T18:17:44  <a1k0n> i suppose not overall.  must be some big mapreduce
2011-11-16T18:17:46  <janzert> at times I'm pretty sure that no matter how high you bid recently it isn't going to give you an instance
2011-11-16T18:17:58  <magiik> if it's some big mapreduce - why use micro isntances? haha
2011-11-16T18:18:10  <a1k0n> because each one is small?  shrug

2011-11-16T18:18:36  <magiik> if your bid is higher than someone else who hsa an instane, it will eventually boot them off and give itto you

2011-11-16T18:19:25  <a1k0n> true
2011-11-16T18:19:29  <magiik> but god damnt i have to manually move my volume data
2011-11-16T18:19:47  <magiik> janzert: ahhh - i see what you are saying, just spot instances in general since they are the "leftovers"
2011-11-16T18:20:03  <janzert> right
2011-11-16T18:20:45  <janzert> it certainly has been causing havoc with our workers :(
2011-11-16T18:20:53  <magiik> man this server has been running as a spot instance with a .20 bid for like a year
2011-11-16T18:20:57  <magiik> and this last month or two spot pricing has been going crazy
2011-11-16T18:21:05  <magiik> is aichallenge on us-east too?
2011-11-16T18:21:11  <janzert> yep
2011-11-16T18:22:03  <magiik> i need some sort of management script, whenever my spot instance does come back up, it loses it's elastic ip
2011-11-16T18:22:28  <magiik> and i need a better way to keep that EBS volume linked up to the new instance too
2011-11-16T18:22:28  <janzert> yeah, I wish the ip tied to the spot request
2011-11-16T18:22:38  <janzert> and that as well :)
2011-11-16T18:23:26  <magiik> such a pain in the ass right now the way i do it - create a snapshot of the orphaned volume, then have to re-create the AMI with that snapshot, then re-request the spot
2011-11-16T18:24:19  <janzert> yeah, using ebs as a root volume for spot instances doesn't work well at all right now
2011-11-16T18:24:33  <janzert> at least not I haven't found a way for it to
2011-11-16T18:24:42  <magiik> yeah...
2011-11-16T18:24:49  <magiik> and i'm too entrenched in this server's config now
2011-11-16T18:25:29  <magiik> damn us-west cali is having some weird spot price ripples too, but not  breaking $1
2011-11-16T18:25:35  <NightExcessive> I simply store my configs on S3 and have my spot instances download them on start. :)
2011-11-16T18:26:18  <amstan> janzert: people on the forums are debating that we should keep the workers on during high prices
2011-11-16T18:26:43  <amstan> but i disagree, especially if it's 50 times more expensive, right?
2011-11-16T18:26:53  <magiik> more than 50....
2011-11-16T18:26:59  <amstan> yeah

2011-11-16T18:30:04  <janzert> yep :)
2011-11-16T18:30:06  <magiik> you guys have scripts to spool instances up and down? or you just go off the instance getting terminated when it crosses the bid threshold?
2011-11-16T18:30:23  <NightExcessive> magiik: The manager is capable of starting instances. I know that.
2011-11-16T18:30:48  <janzert> they're permanent spot requests at the threshold prices and the user_data script brings it up as worker
2011-11-16T18:31:21  <magiik> wonder if it's worth the effort to switch to regular instances if the spot price is exceeding that price
2011-11-16T18:32:08  <NightExcessive> Maybe. Though, the spot prices should go back down as soon as Amazon installs new physical nodes.

2011-11-16T18:47:41  <mikewintermute> magiik: thanks
2011-11-16T18:47:52  <magiik> i dont think there is any "auto-increment" built into the script
2011-11-16T18:48:00  <magiik> so you'd have to make your own wrapper around it if you wanted automatic functionality
2011-11-16T18:48:02  <McLeopold> there is -runs i think
2011-11-16T18:48:15  <magiik> ah -r
2011-11-16T18:48:23  <McLeopold> but not between runs
2011-11-16T18:48:25  <magiik> then yeah i gues it would auto-increment, starting from -g #
2011-11-16T18:48:34  <janzert> actually did go to regular instance for a while earlier this week
2011-11-16T18:49:06  <amstan> janzert: doesn't that mean a different cpu?
2011-11-16T18:49:12  <janzert> no
2011-11-16T18:49:17  <janzert> same instance type
2011-11-16T18:49:23  <janzert> just different pricing
2011-11-16T18:49:27  <McLeopold> amstan: heard from j3camero lately? about accepting donations?
2011-11-16T18:49:29  <magiik> yeah same number of compute units
2011-11-16T18:49:41  <magiik> they are exactly the same - except for price/availability
2011-11-16T18:50:02  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah, he wrote me earlier today and has paypal setup now
2011-11-16T18:50:15  <janzert> so hopefully he can get us a donate button soon

2011-11-16T18:51:03  <McLeopold> to spend the donated money as fast as possible :)

2011-11-16T18:52:01  <McLeopold> across users, so even if they upload a starter a second time, it wouldn't play
2011-11-16T18:52:21  <janzert> accross submissions you mean

2011-11-16T18:52:51  <mcstar> how can i remove a file from git?
2011-11-16T18:52:51  <McLeopold> how about detecting starters and setting the mu to 0?
2011-11-16T18:52:58  <mcstar> i.e. to tell it not to track it
2011-11-16T18:53:00  <McLeopold> "git rm <filename>"
2011-11-16T18:53:04  <mcstar> thx
2011-11-16T18:53:06  <janzert> how would you decide it was a starter as well?
2011-11-16T18:53:10  <McLeopold> you'll need to commit it as well
2011-11-16T18:53:20  <McLeopold> which is weird because you commit a non-existant file
2011-11-16T18:53:44  <mcstar> McLeopold: ok, and how can i list all tracked files?
2011-11-16T18:53:46  <McLeopold> janzert: assuming I can detect it of course, I'm going to try submission hashes then build a database
2011-11-16T18:53:51  <McLeopold> "git status"
2011-11-16T18:53:54  <mcstar> stupid questions, but i didnt find these
2011-11-16T18:53:56  <mcstar> ah
2011-11-16T18:54:37  <janzert> :( yeah, that seems so fragile but I'm not sure if there's a better way
2011-11-16T18:54:38  <mcstar> no, status doesnt list tracked files
2011-11-16T18:56:17  <janzert> Maybe set up an admin page that lists submissions with same hash and allow the admin to mark them as starter bots

2011-11-16T19:00:20  <mcstar> and have qt ready
2011-11-16T19:00:29  <NightExcessive> I don't see anything horrible the idea. Getting a hash of the starter zips and limiting it to 10 games/starter package/user seems reasonable.
2011-11-16T19:00:49  <amstan> NightExcessive: i just updated 2 starter packages today
2011-11-16T19:00:57  <amstan> not everyone updates
2011-11-16T19:01:19  <NightExcessive> amstan: It's simple enough to keep a hash list of old & current starter packages :)
2011-11-16T19:01:22  <mcstar> amstan: amstan, pls try it again, its much better
2011-11-16T19:01:24  <janzert> yeah, that's the fragility of it. there are going to be lots of starter bot hashes and more all the time

2011-11-16T19:02:38  <amstan> we keep making new starter packages, with different contents
2011-11-16T19:02:43  <amstan> all of them have different hashes
2011-11-16T19:03:22  <mcstar> a change of 1 characters throws off the hash, but it is still a starter bot
2011-11-16T19:03:26  <mcstar> -s
2011-11-16T19:03:32  <analyst74> is starter package a serious problem? how many starter bots are active?
2011-11-16T19:03:52  <mcstar> id say more than half of all bots
2011-11-16T19:03:53  <amstan> we already have a 3 day timeout, i seriously doubt any contestant keeps starter packages alive
2011-11-16T19:03:56  <NightExcessive> mcstar: Fair enough. Though, this would solve simple situations where it's the package just downloaded and re-uploaded.
2011-11-16T19:04:01  <janzert> mcstar: I doubt it
2011-11-16T19:04:08  <mcstar> janzert: how much then?
2011-11-16T19:04:12  <janzert> there are only ~900 bots active
2011-11-16T19:04:22  <janzert> and 2400 bots haven't played at all
2011-11-16T19:04:22  <mcstar> so you mean even more?
2011-11-16T19:04:28  <janzert> in the last day
2011-11-16T19:04:31  <NightExcessive> amstan: How large is the database of submissions? String comparison is fairly cheap, but I could see comparing (a few thousand strings)*20 being expensive.
2011-11-16T19:04:45  <janzert> so I have a feeling most starter bots already aren't playing
2011-11-16T19:05:02  <amstan> NightExcessive: why are you concerned about this?
2011-11-16T19:05:30  <NightExcessive> amstan: I was just curious about the size, as it limits the practicality of the idea.

2011-11-16T19:06:43  <mcstar> anyway, its sort of bad that it depends on qt
2011-11-16T19:06:54  <amstan> looks good though
2011-11-16T19:07:04  <mcstar> do you think a binary distribution is a problem?
2011-11-16T19:07:08  <amstan> yes
2011-11-16T19:07:18  <mcstar> even if its from github?
2011-11-16T19:07:22  <mcstar> i mean the binary
2011-11-16T19:07:22  <janzert> there have been 23,719 submissions so far. I doubt the computational load of implementing this is an impediment in any way
2011-11-16T19:07:28  <amstan> you shouldn't have binaries on github in the first place
2011-11-16T19:07:37  <mcstar> yeah, but i can have
2011-11-16T19:07:49  <mcstar> but seen this latest one?
2011-11-16T19:08:11  <mcstar> theres a transition effect, and you can more conveniently add/remove ants
2011-11-16T19:09:17  <NightExcessive> If it would really have an effect on the game rate I don't see a problem with using a simple hash and category system. Categorize the starter packs by language and look for matching hashes, then count them per category per user- and don't allow more than 10 games per category (from each user).
2011-11-16T19:09:37  <amstan> NightExcessive: you don't get it
2011-11-16T19:09:47  <amstan> NightExcessive: some starter packages have like 10 versions, so 10 different hashes
2011-11-16T19:09:47  <NightExcessive> Oh?
2011-11-16T19:10:02  <janzert> keeping the hash database up to date is what will be the pain
2011-11-16T19:10:05  <amstan> and i don't even think we can get the hashes of the old versions
2011-11-16T19:10:14  <amstan> the zips might have dates in them or something
2011-11-16T19:10:32  <amstan> unless we do hashes of the contents
2011-11-16T19:10:41  <NightExcessive> If they're in git, you can simply go back to the commit with them in it. I can see how it could be a pain keeping the hashes up-to-date.
2011-11-16T19:11:02  <janzert> ugh, currently we don't uncompress a submission on the main server at all
2011-11-16T19:11:06  <magiik> contents... you could zip it up different ways right?

2011-11-16T19:11:59  <janzert> but it does seem to add a lot of complexity for what looks like little gain
2011-11-16T19:12:02  <janzert> right
2011-11-16T19:12:17  <amstan> i really don't think begginers keep their starter bots active
2011-11-16T19:12:29  <amstan> they'll stay active at most 3 days
2011-11-16T19:12:29  <NightExcessive> janzert: I agree... it doesn't seem like a pressing issue, nor does it seem it would really speed up the games per second.
2011-11-16T19:12:32  <magiik> and if someone is activating their starter bot... it's not like they are activating another bot since you aren't supposed to have multi accounts
2011-11-16T19:12:43  <janzert> most users don't keep their submission active :/
2011-11-16T19:12:57  <magiik> i even lose my real submission's activity every once in a while
2011-11-16T19:12:58  <mcstar> amstan: doesnt it mean only that those cant be seeds,
2011-11-16T19:13:00  <janzert> there are currently 946 active
2011-11-16T19:13:05  <mcstar> they still play games
2011-11-16T19:13:11  <amstan> mcstar: sure, nothing wrong with that
2011-11-16T19:13:37  <mcstar> so isnt the issue of sparing resources?
2011-11-16T19:13:44  <mcstar> (i was late to join in)
2011-11-16T19:14:06  <janzert> oops, actually there 1016 active.
2011-11-16T19:14:08  <Minthos> you could hash all submissions, store the hashes, and reject any bots with hashes identical to more than just a few other bots - but the tutorial/intro thing tells players to upload the starting kit so maybe it's better to just let people do it and keep the current system
2011-11-16T19:14:23  <amstan> yes.. but i don't think it's worth implementing such a complicated system for such few speedups
2011-11-16T19:14:39  <janzert> Minthos: right we still want people to start with uploading a starter for sure
2011-11-16T19:14:41  <magiik> how about not letting inactive bots below a certain rank even play at all
2011-11-16T19:14:58  <janzert> 1/3rd of bots aren't playing now ;)
2011-11-16T19:15:31  <magiik> even as a new submission comes in with lowest rank?
2011-11-16T19:15:56  <janzert> yep, a little more than 1/3rd of bots have not played in the last day
2011-11-16T19:16:02  <mcstar> how about segmenting the ranking, and give higher cuts more time on the server?
2011-11-16T19:16:19  <magiik> i would think the inverse... give lower cuts more time heh
2011-11-16T19:16:23  <magiik> otherwise how are you going to get up there?
2011-11-16T19:16:26  <amstan> magiik: i don't think that's a good idea from a rankings perspective
2011-11-16T19:16:35  <janzert> remember even though a new submission is ranked at the bottom it starts off playing in the roughly the middle of the established rankings
2011-11-16T19:16:49  <janzert> and goes up from there so long as it wins
2011-11-16T19:16:49  <mcstar> well, thats the point: there are more bad bots than good ones, they need to play less
2011-11-16T19:17:08  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-16T19:17:14  <mcstar> not from the absolute end
2011-11-16T19:17:26  <janzert> we want people who are actively working on their bot to get games even if their bot isn't so good :}

2011-11-16T19:18:03  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-16T19:18:14  <magiik> how was it for the other competitions? is this the most popular so far?
2011-11-16T19:18:21  <mcstar> i celebrated the 10kth user with a rainbow

2011-11-16T19:18:42  <amstan> we had a pretty exponential growth since the first contest

2011-11-16T19:20:40  <janzert> besides ec2 being funky with its spot prices this week the rate of games a server can get out has gone down quite a bit (i.e. bots are using a lot more of their time on average now)
2011-11-16T19:21:11  <janzert> which also points to the probability that we're playing much fewer starter bots

2011-11-16T20:20:52  <gcflymoto> let me rephrase. an ant out by its lonesome self has a vision radius of sqrt(ants.viewradius2) .. the boundary would be the points along the circle of the view radius.. question is whether Bresenham's circle algorithm match those points.. probably not because of the rounding during sqrt()?
2011-11-16T20:21:31  <amstan> gcflymoto: i'm not familiar with that algorithm

2011-11-16T20:27:41  <Rinum> how does combat work? if distance between 2 ants is < attack radius?
2011-11-16T20:27:56  <mleise> There is no rounding during sqrt !
2011-11-16T20:28:19  <mleise> Rinum: yes, <= attack radius
2011-11-16T20:28:37  <Rinum> also, it seems attacks can happen diagonally? so the calculated distance is a little different
2011-11-16T20:28:48  <mleise> But use the squared radius and squared distance, it is faster that way
2011-11-16T20:29:31  <Rinum> what do you mean?
2011-11-16T20:29:32  <a1k0n> i'm sure bresenham would give you the same result

2011-11-16T21:19:42  <bmh> On a general graph, this wouldn't guarantee shortest pathes, but I believe (have not proven...) that it should give exact queries given the restricted graph we're working with

2011-11-16T21:21:49  <Antimony> I can find the closest target to each ant in only a couple ms
2011-11-16T21:22:05  <bmh> Antimony: The preprocessing cost should be O(#subdivisions * #subdivision_size * #neighbors)

2011-11-16T21:36:57  <a1k0n> oh, i see.  you make a kind of quadtree where the path through each cell in the quadtree is obvious
2011-11-16T21:37:15  <a1k0n> which you were sort of proposing before, but with more general open rectangles
2011-11-16T21:38:02  <a1k0n> you might have up to 2N-1 nodes in that graph

2011-11-16T21:40:51  <bmh> It really doesn't matter. The cost of stitching the supercells together is (#cells * #neighbors)
2011-11-16T21:41:14  <bmh> the danger is some pathological case where the number of edges explodes

2011-11-16T22:02:56  <bmh> mleise: I'm not sure about the point placement strategy (uniform, uniform random, poisson disk sampling, jittered grid) -- but I think it makes sense to construct the cells by BFS
2011-11-16T22:03:22  <mleise> ok, now i get the picture ;)
2011-11-16T22:03:51  <bmh> it would be cool to minimize the number of cells on edges.
2011-11-16T22:05:26  <mleise> You need to have cells consisting only of connected squares, else what would happen in a maze where two points are in the same cell, but not physically connected there.
2011-11-16T22:05:48  <bmh> if you constructed it by BFS, that isn't possible.
2011-11-16T22:06:05  <mleise> dito, so no random sampling
2011-11-16T22:07:05  <mleise> still you may end up with cell A being first and claiming an area that 'carves' out cell C
2011-11-16T22:07:34  <mleise> so the shortest path inside C for some points may be through that part of A
2011-11-16T22:08:14  <bmh> I'm not sure about convexity guarantees.
2011-11-16T22:08:58  <mleise> -> so you need to write a thesis, proof it and come up with an algorithm to guarantee it ;)
2011-11-16T22:10:12  <mleise> It does exist. If your cells are 1x1 they are all convex. So ... if you go from there you have a solid foundation, hehe
2011-11-16T22:10:29  <amstan> so.. i forgot about rotational symmetries

2011-11-16T22:16:47  <amstan> how would you label this map? http://paste.aichallenge.org/xqx7g/
2011-11-16T22:16:58  <amstan> it's not rotational
2011-11-16T22:17:05  <mleise> no it is ...
2011-11-16T22:17:09  <mleise> mirrored
2011-11-16T22:17:53  <amstan> yeah, it's point mirror
2011-11-16T22:18:26  <mleise> I don't think a point mirror exists :D
2011-11-16T22:19:14  <mleise> To me it looks like one horizontal and one vertical mirror
2011-11-16T22:19:36  <nickjohnson> Yes, it has two axes of reflective symmetry

2011-11-16T22:29:24  <mleise> I think talking about my path finding idea will motivate me to implement it, but I don't want someone else to try it out before I do ^^
2011-11-16T22:30:48  <amstan> if i were to make an irc server, i would have a filter for impacient people
2011-11-16T22:30:55  <mleise> So I rather listen to others talking about their A* or BFS approaches
2011-11-16T22:31:19  <amstan> the first few messages you send(if you're new), they'll be buffered, and only after like 2 minutes(if you haven't left) they'll be transmitted to the channel
2011-11-16T22:31:28  <amstan> that should filter out people
2011-11-16T22:31:36  <aarossig> amstan: no need to redefine irc for this, make an impatience detection algorithm and get a bot to the dirty work lol
2011-11-16T22:31:37  <mleise> amstan: that's cruel, but effective ;)
2011-11-16T22:31:54  <amstan> aarossig: yes, but what could a bot do though?
2011-11-16T22:31:56  <aarossig> amstan: nvm then lol
2011-11-16T22:32:07  <aarossig> amstan: you could have a metachannel
2011-11-16T22:32:16  <amstan> aarossig: by the time the bot gets mad at him because he signed out it's already too late
2011-11-16T22:32:22  <aarossig> amstan: in the words of mcstar.. the realaichallenge
2011-11-16T22:32:43  <aarossig> no.. just have 2 channels
2011-11-16T22:32:51  <aarossig> one for people with answers
2011-11-16T22:32:55  <aarossig> could be any random channel
2011-11-16T22:33:06  <aarossig> and then have a bot that relays the messages between the two
2011-11-16T22:33:15  <aarossig> any messages that come in the random channel are the patient people :D
2011-11-16T22:33:16  <aarossig> lol
2011-11-16T22:33:25  <amstan> sure, but that's more sketchy than modifying an irc server
2011-11-16T22:33:36  <aarossig> amstan: i suppose
2011-11-16T22:33:45  <aarossig> as if the entire idea isn't sketchy lol
2011-11-16T22:33:56  <nickjohnson> I like the idea. It alwas strikes me as bizarre when someone joins and leaves 2 minutes after answering a question
2011-11-16T22:34:15  <aarossig> amstan: awesome http://www.shopenzed.com/unearthed-kauri-boxed-mens-pen-xidp233496.html
2011-11-16T22:34:23  <amstan> nickjohnson: the funny part is that irc is like the absolute fastest to get answers from
2011-11-16T22:34:28  <aarossig> amstan: i feel like your dad would really like that for an xmas gift
2011-11-16T22:34:30  <amstan> nickjohnson: short of searching yourself
2011-11-16T22:35:15  <aarossig> amstan: i agree, but sometimes... if you're struggling for an hour you just need someone to give you a keyword or even say something totally unrelated that helps get you back on track and solve the issue
2011-11-16T22:35:38  <amstan> aarossig: yes, but that's no reason to leave after 2 minutes of silence
2011-11-16T22:35:46  <aarossig> agreed
2011-11-16T22:36:33  <mleise> 38 seconds in the last case

2011-11-16T22:38:12  <amstan> aarossig: what's the connection with people leaving before they get questions answered?
2011-11-16T22:38:32  <aarossig> amstan: nothing at all, that topic seemed like it was rounding completion
2011-11-16T22:40:49  <thestinger> well, I have _extremely_ basic combat now

2011-11-16T22:42:04  <thestinger> it's really crappy even for that though
2011-11-16T22:42:46  <thestinger> need to get them to strafe/circle if they aren't going to attack instead of just staying there
2011-11-16T22:43:11  <amstan> thestinger: have your tried mcstar's tool thing for combat simulations?

2011-11-16T22:44:06  <thestinger> so I know which ants/enemies will die (assuming enemies don't move)
2011-11-16T22:44:25  <Scryer> How can I tell which of my hills are still alive? Do I have to have an ant near enough to see them?
2011-11-16T22:44:32  <amstan> Scryer: yes
2011-11-16T22:44:41  <Scryer> Thanks.
2011-11-16T22:44:53  <amstan> Scryer: if not.. you can know for sure if you just had an ant spawn from one
2011-11-16T22:45:07  <thestinger> I rewrote a lot of my bot so that I do all regular movement and end up with a hash table with ants as keys and directions as values
2011-11-16T22:45:12  <thestinger> and then I change it around for combat
2011-11-16T22:45:53  <amstan> i should probably eat something more
2011-11-16T22:45:58  <Scryer> Roger - I thought about keeping track of how much food I've collected compared to how many hills should be spawning. Seems like a nuisance. :)

2011-11-16T23:37:35  <mleise> -use
2011-11-16T23:37:35  <Cowbandit> well the thing is
2011-11-16T23:37:51  <Cowbandit> i'm using bluej
2011-11-16T23:37:54  <Cowbandit> and for some reason
2011-11-16T23:38:06  <Cowbandit> it has like a 75 line maximum terminal window
2011-11-16T23:38:12  <Cowbandit> so i can't paste all the bot input int
2011-11-16T23:38:17  <Cowbandit> in* all at once
2011-11-16T23:39:02  <mleise> ok, then make your bot load the bot input file. (Add it as a command line parameter)
2011-11-16T23:39:22  <Cowbandit> o so how does one do that?
2011-11-16T23:39:33  <Cowbandit> lol sorry i'm a noob
2011-11-16T23:39:36  <mleise> you have the bot input file?
2011-11-16T23:39:40  <Cowbandit> yeah
2011-11-16T23:39:52  <mleise> ok, do you see the main() method?
2011-11-16T23:39:57  <mleise> in your Java bot?
2011-11-16T23:40:02  <Cowbandit> ya
2011-11-16T23:40:32  <mleise> ok the method signature should read something like main(String[] args), right?
2011-11-16T23:40:42  <Cowbandit> yeah it's that one
2011-11-16T23:40:47  <thestinger> still no strafing/encircling yet but I've improved combat a bit http://paste.aichallenge.org/o73GH/ :)
2011-11-16T23:40:53  <Cowbandit> and there's only one line it new MyBot().readSystemInput();
2011-11-16T23:41:17  <mleise> Cowbandit: ok, now check if args.length is != 0
2011-11-16T23:41:39  <thestinger> have them set to take no losses atm, but that's temporary
2011-11-16T23:41:42  <mleise> in that case load the file args[0] and read input from there
2011-11-16T23:41:52  <Cowbandit> oh
2011-11-16T23:42:04  <Cowbandit> so i just name my file args?
2011-11-16T23:42:07  <mleise> it would be best, if you added a MyBot().readFileInput();
2011-11-16T23:42:30  <mleise> new MyBot().readFileInput(args[0]);
2011-11-16T23:42:38  <Cowbandit> wait so how do i specify the file that I want to use?
2011-11-16T23:43:07  <mleise> then when you start the debugger, add "C:\Ants\game_logs\bot0.input" or something like that.
2011-11-16T23:43:32  <mleise> I *hope* BlueJ allows command-line arguments
2011-11-16T23:43:47  <Cowbandit> lol hopefully
2011-11-16T23:43:49  <Cowbandit> thanks for the help
2011-11-16T23:43:55  <Cowbandit> this should save me a lot of time
2011-11-16T23:44:43  <mleise> Since file and terminal input are both InputStreams in Java, you should be able to reuse all that code in the bot class.
