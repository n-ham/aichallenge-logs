2011-07-06T08:55:54  <mcstar> now i understand some people's frustration about the beta server: we need bigger resources even for beta :( , so annoying to wait for results, but i guess Kwai Chang Caine would say that: You need to learn patience, Young Grasshopper!
2011-07-06T09:03:27  <GreenTea> most annoyance is because lack of information. On Github last commit was 2011-07-04 Update Mono version description.  This means all is done? Or what? What are stopper taks. Why they are not resolved? Many questions and no info. Is it so hard to make some current status post on the formum? Now on formum the most active persons are spam bots. It's a shame..

2011-07-06T13:25:53  <Zalama> Can someone help me how to run tools in windows?
2011-07-06T13:33:12  <gobang> tell a bit more about the problem, someone will jump at it
2011-07-06T13:42:06  <smiley1983> does running play_one_game.cmd work?
2011-07-06T13:51:35  <Zalama> Well I have no idea what happens there.. command line just blinks fast
2011-07-06T13:51:43  <Zalama> and nothing really happens
2011-07-06T13:54:40  <a1k0n_> uh, try running it from cmd.exe rather than clicking on it?
2011-07-06T13:55:27  <Zalama> how the heck I'm supposed to run command script from there?
2011-07-06T13:56:51  <smiley1983> use "cd" and "dir" to navigate to the appropriate directory
2011-07-06T13:57:26  <smiley1983> however, it sounds like you might have the wrong version of Python installed, possibly
2011-07-06T13:57:49  <smiley1983> I think there may also be a "keep this window open" option somewhere, if you right click on the .cmd file
2011-07-06T13:58:00  <Zalama> Well.. I don't think I have any python installed
2011-07-06T13:58:09  <smiley1983> right, that would be the problem
2011-07-06T13:58:24  <Zalama> Since I have never had need for it anyway :)
2011-07-06T13:58:34  <Zalama> So where should I get the right version?
2011-07-06T13:58:39  <smiley1983> I think it's Python 2.7 they're using
2011-07-06T13:58:43  <gobang> you'll need 2.7
2011-07-06T13:58:59  <Zalama> thx

2011-07-06T14:32:54  <mleise> hi mcstar
2011-07-06T14:33:19  <mcstar> for a couple of days now im experiencing the "shadow" rpoblem with ff :)
2011-07-06T14:34:18  <mleise> haha, I have an angel and a devil sitting on my shoulders
2011-07-06T14:35:05  <mleise> angel: "come on, be kind and provide a workaround", devil: "that's not your job to fix, if firefox 5 sucks then why use it"
2011-07-06T14:35:32  <mcstar> i dont like ff
2011-07-06T14:35:44  <mcstar> but somehow it comes up when i play a game
2011-07-06T14:35:53  <mcstar> tell me where to change it to chromium :)
2011-07-06T14:36:13  <mcstar> (i guess i could find out myself but i was lazy...)
2011-07-06T14:36:28  <Zalama> could someone be so nice to give working command line for tools
2011-07-06T14:36:29  <mleise> which os?
2011-07-06T14:36:38  <Zalama> win
2011-07-06T14:36:42  <mcstar> you, know, the kind that works
2011-07-06T14:36:52  <mleise> macos?
2011-07-06T14:37:02  <mcstar> linux
2011-07-06T14:37:14  <mleise> sorry Zalama, i was talking to mcstar
2011-07-06T14:37:31  <mleise> which desktop? xfce4, gnome, kde, ...?
2011-07-06T14:37:34  <Zalama> oh
2011-07-06T14:38:34  <mcstar> mleise: awesome
2011-07-06T14:38:38  <mcstar> hehe
2011-07-06T14:38:56  <mleise> mcstar: in gnome it is control center -> preferred applications (roughly translated to english)
2011-07-06T14:38:59  <mcstar> i configure file associations with xdg-mime
2011-07-06T14:39:14  <mcstar> no gnome, sorry
2011-07-06T14:39:28  <mcstar> im askingif its xdg related, or the script has the browser hardwired
2011-07-06T14:39:34  <mcstar> but i guess its the first then
2011-07-06T14:39:34  <mleise> Oo you are doing arcane stuff
2011-07-06T14:39:42  <mcstar> arcane? as in old?
2011-07-06T14:39:52  <mcstar> this is state-of-the-art freedesktop.org
2011-07-06T14:39:59  <mleise> hehe, you see I'm not using Linux for a long time
2011-07-06T14:40:25  <mcstar> ok, then i just have to assoc. html with chromium
2011-07-06T14:40:26  <mcstar> thx
2011-07-06T14:40:29  <mleise> Only worked with Gnome and XFCE4 when it comes to Xorg
2011-07-06T14:40:35  <mcstar> anyway you could remove the shadow :)
2011-07-06T14:40:42  <mleise> the script doesn't hardwire anything, no
2011-07-06T14:41:13  <mleise> but it looks cool in .. hmm what browsers are left? Opera!
2011-07-06T14:41:26  <mcstar> mleise: and theres a pro to ff5, it feels noticeably faster to use your visualization
2011-07-06T14:42:12  <mleise> chromium is as fast as FF 4 in my tests did FF 5 change that?

2011-07-06T14:42:50  <mcstar> for me ff4 felt slower(the whole interface too) than ff5 now
2011-07-06T14:43:04  <mcstar> chromium was always faster, now too
2011-07-06T14:43:26  <mcstar> but i usually have like 40+ tabs open in chromium
2011-07-06T14:44:01  <UncleVasya> ZALAMA: you can use testing util
2011-07-06T14:44:16  <mleise> They changed it so that JavaScript timers in background tabs gets executed at most once per second

2011-07-06T14:46:53  <mleise> why do i see so many question marks?
2011-07-06T14:47:01  <mcstar> i dont

2011-07-06T14:47:34  <UncleVasya> buttons on My phone are broken.
2011-07-06T14:48:02  <UncleVasya> No, I mean...

2011-07-06T14:48:45  <mcstar> mleise: i wonder how much people are disappointed for not succeeding in using the tools...
2011-07-06T14:48:52  <mcstar> hell, how many
2011-07-06T14:48:55  <UncleVasya> Ants testing utilty for Win
2011-07-06T14:48:56  <gobang> Zalama, you made progress, just add the path to your bot
2011-07-06T14:49:30  <mleise> mcstar: What would help the situation?
2011-07-06T14:49:36  <UncleVasya> It builds a correct command line
2011-07-06T14:50:07  <mcstar> mleise: UncleVasya's graphicsal interface... i dont know, im kidding, its pretty simple now
2011-07-06T14:50:10  <UncleVasya> It creats file named test.cmd in the ants dir.
2011-07-06T14:50:23  <Zalama> Now when I add some sample bot to there as mybot.py
2011-07-06T14:50:27  <Zalama> Then happens nothing

2011-07-06T14:50:39  <Zalama> So something really is wrong with that tool
2011-07-06T14:50:56  <mleise> mcstar: no, the idea is good. it gets you going quickly without first learning the details of the engine
2011-07-06T14:51:34  <UncleVasya> You can use that file for examwle
2011-07-06T14:52:07  <mcstar> mleise: when the contest really starts, there wont be enough manpower to answer these questions
2011-07-06T14:52:47  <UncleVasya> I think you need to add non-exe bots with key for launch:
2011-07-06T14:53:16  <mleise> But I have some concerns about the quality at the moment, no offense. The copyrighted title picture, some rough layouting in the windows and it only runs *natively* on Windows.

2011-07-06T14:54:59  <mcstar> mleise: ive never seen it :)
2011-07-06T14:55:35  <mleise> you should download it! you only need to configure your github ants directory and are ready to go
2011-07-06T14:55:41  <UncleVasya> btw I'm in train now.
2011-07-06T14:55:46  <mcstar> ok ive got it: there should be a turorial video
2011-07-06T14:55:52  <mcstar> everyone loves watching videos
2011-07-06T14:56:04  <mcstar> maybe we can mix in some Matrix effects too

2011-07-06T14:58:28  <mcstar> mleise: why would o download it? first of all i dont need it, second of all i dont like gui's, and third, its for windows, oh and forth, its written in delphi
2011-07-06T14:59:14  <mleise> mcstar: right, a lot of pros for me! wow a gui! yeah good ol' Delphi!
2011-07-06T14:59:44  <gobang> .. and ppl reported running that on wine
2011-07-06T15:00:53  <mleise> mcstar: Ok look at it from the other side, UncleVasya is obviously still learning to program and create guis, so why not support him a little. He is looking at the download number in the forum and will be very happy to see it climb. Maybe you can give him some tips on how to improve it.
2011-07-06T15:01:32  <mcstar> im writing a dowload bot, wait a sec, how many downloads would he need?
2011-07-06T15:01:35  <mcstar> :D
2011-07-06T15:01:39  <mleise> gobang: Yes I helped him with making it compatible using relative paths and '/' instead of '\' which is supported since Windows 2000
2011-07-06T15:02:13  <mleise> Don't improve the number of downloads, but the program itself -.- haha
2011-07-06T15:02:21  <gobang> ;)
2011-07-06T15:02:38  <mcstar> turned out today, i will have to deal with graphics soon

2011-07-06T15:03:39  <Zalama> o'rly
2011-07-06T15:03:45  <mleise> go play myst to get your frustration level settled *g*
2011-07-06T15:04:02  <mleise> hmm, the commands you showed look right
2011-07-06T15:04:02  <mcstar> yeah, testing physics simaltions on tesla gpu's, i can get some money for it, ill have to share my time between this and Ants
2011-07-06T15:04:44  <mleise> nice, I met someone in a pub here that worked with cuda for video processing
2011-07-06T15:05:09  <mleise> i think it was for a surveillance monitor showing 16 cameras at once
2011-07-06T15:05:25  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-06T15:05:34  <mcstar> why do they need cuda?
2011-07-06T15:05:43  <mcstar> i mean, whats to process?
2011-07-06T15:06:08  <mcstar> for motion detection?
2011-07-06T15:06:18  <mleise> Maybe. I don't really remember.

2011-07-06T15:07:14  <mcstar> like this one?
2011-07-06T15:08:18  <mleise> that is a genetic experiment, right? tell me it is.
2011-07-06T15:08:39  <mcstar> the letters weren't on the hog, when it was born
2011-07-06T15:08:48  <mcstar> but i think thats a legit pircture
2011-07-06T15:10:39  <mcstar> This wild hog might set a new world record. And it was killed by a 11 year old Alabama boy using a .50 caliber pistol.
2011-07-06T15:11:23  <gobang> histogram orientaded gradients, or similar. used for detecting people in video
2011-07-06T15:11:24  <mleise> ouch, sounds like the poor hog might have suffered
2011-07-06T15:11:35  <Zalama> So no tips?
2011-07-06T15:11:42  <mcstar> here's 50cents
2011-07-06T15:11:43  <mleise> but world record, I understand :)
2011-07-06T15:12:14  <mcstar> Zalama: im tired, and hungry, i can only find gigantic hog pictures now
2011-07-06T15:12:34  <mleise> lol, a hungry hungarian
2011-07-06T15:13:01  <mcstar> well, dont mention that im hungry for Turkey
2011-07-06T15:14:32  <mleise> nice one ;), but what am I joking about 'german' means spear man, referring to the hurled spears that were used here several hundred years ago. which reminds me of hunting hogs again
2011-07-06T15:15:54  <mcstar> Zalama: why dont you use cygwin anyway?
2011-07-06T15:16:13  <mcstar> i mean it should work without it, but with it, you could use nice bash scripts
2011-07-06T15:16:31  <Zalama> And whats that?
2011-07-06T15:16:37  <mcstar> google?

2011-07-06T15:20:53  <Zalama> There is no output :)
2011-07-06T15:20:56  <Zalama> thats the thing

2011-07-06T15:21:16  <mcstar> how did they get there?

2011-07-06T15:21:23  <mleise> Zalama: does it hog cpu time?
2011-07-06T15:21:47  <mleise> or just exit immediatly

2011-07-06T15:22:11  <mleise> ???
2011-07-06T15:22:21  <mcstar> there some inconsistency here..
2011-07-06T15:22:29  <Zalama> ehm
2011-07-06T15:22:35  <Zalama> that is just windows commandline
2011-07-06T15:22:37  <Zalama> to give the output
2011-07-06T15:22:41  <mleise> mcstar: that is most probably the content of the script
2011-07-06T15:22:49  <Zalama> thats the one whats already in tool package
2011-07-06T15:23:10  <mcstar> yes, but playgame.py should start from a prompt, like play_one_game.cmd does
2011-07-06T15:23:11  <Zalama> but it doesn't matter.. same happens if I use playgame.py and syntax manually
2011-07-06T15:23:13  <mleise> this is windows, it prints commands on the console unless hidden by "@" in front of the line or "@echo off"
2011-07-06T15:23:16  <mcstar> after >
2011-07-06T15:23:24  <mcstar> hm?
2011-07-06T15:23:26  <mcstar> really?
2011-07-06T15:23:45  <mcstar> it echoes all commands from a script?
2011-07-06T15:24:02  <mcstar> ok, i didnt know that, my bad
2011-07-06T15:24:25  <Zalama> actually even those scripts have @echo on them :)
2011-07-06T15:25:03  <mleise> Zalama: they do have "@echo off" and still they print the command?
2011-07-06T15:25:06  <mleise> that's odd
2011-07-06T15:25:19  <mleise> but not the problem as you clearified
2011-07-06T15:25:19  <Zalama> no not @echo off

2011-07-06T15:28:25  <Zalama> anyway atleast that is working that way now
2011-07-06T15:28:46  <mleise> so is the .cmd file in github erroneous?
2011-07-06T15:28:47  <mcstar> Zalama: dont let problems like this put you off :)
2011-07-06T15:28:48  <Zalama> but someone should fix that tools package then :)
2011-07-06T15:28:54  <Zalama> mleise: yes
2011-07-06T15:29:28  <Zalama> Maybe I can debug my bot now :)
2011-07-06T15:29:44  <mcstar> Zalama: leave a few ants in there..
2011-07-06T15:30:00  <mleise> Zalama: It says "@echo off" for me
2011-07-06T15:31:21  <mleise> So the github version of play_one_game.cmd is correct
2011-07-06T15:31:38  <Zalama> Well I got mine from http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip to thats not the same one?
2011-07-06T15:31:53  <Zalama> *to=so
2011-07-06T15:32:16  <Zalama> since I'm really confused about these beta file locations and file system anyway :)
2011-07-06T15:32:55  <mleise> omg who created that tools package?!?
2011-07-06T15:33:27  <mleise> it contains compiled python files, unnesssecary source code etc...
2011-07-06T15:33:35  <mleise> even cvs files *g*
2011-07-06T15:34:05  <mleise> Zalama: the file in tools.zip is the same
2011-07-06T15:34:12  <mleise> "@echo off"
2011-07-06T15:34:12  <mleise> python %~dp0playgame.py --engine_seed 42 --player_seed 42 --end_wait=0.25 --verbose --log_dir game_logs --turns 1000 --map_file %~dp0maps\symmetric_maps\symmetric_10.map %* "python %~dp0sample_bots\python\HunterBot.py" "python %~dp0sample_bots\python\LeftyBot.py" "python %~dp0sample_bots\python\HunterBot.py" "python %~dp0sample_bots\python\LeftyBot.py"
2011-07-06T15:34:45  <Zalama> Ehm
2011-07-06T15:34:48  <Zalama> Not for me anyway
2011-07-06T15:34:58  <Zalama> Since I didn't touch to those until now
2011-07-06T15:35:03  <mleise> I assume that the tools.zip was created under linux with Unix line endings and windows cannot read them
2011-07-06T15:35:15  <Zalama> well it works now anyway
2011-07-06T15:35:18  <Zalama> :)
2011-07-06T15:36:25  <mleise> Zalama: It works because you fixed it for you, but it won't work for anyone else downloading the package on windows most probably
2011-07-06T15:36:25  <mcstar> Zalama: always use github, sometimes specifications change, and can lead to some surprises
2011-07-06T15:36:38  <mcstar> before you upload, always test with the latest
2011-07-06T15:36:55  <mleise> git has the ability to convert line-endings during checkout/commit
2011-07-06T15:37:06  <mleise> just like FTP in ASCII mode
2011-07-06T15:37:19  <mleise> (if anyone knows that :p )
2011-07-06T15:37:29  <mcstar> show me im a nub, i always download the tar,gz

2011-07-06T15:38:48  <mleise> ok so we need to keep windows scripts in CR/LF style. I hope we can trick git into accepting this without warnings
2011-07-06T15:40:39  <Zalama> now to problem to compile my bot
2011-07-06T15:40:48  <Zalama> maybe then I can start debugging :P
2011-07-06T15:41:17  <mleise> I have to launch gdb manually to debug :/
2011-07-06T15:53:14  <Zalama> Finally I was able to run my bot game locally

2011-07-06T15:58:36  <gobang> no
2011-07-06T15:59:43  <mleise> is there a tools.tar.gz?
2011-07-06T16:00:10  <mcstar> mleise: you can select on github what you want, zip or tar.gz
2011-07-06T16:01:14  <mleise> so the file on aichallengebeta is actually produced by github? then why is the folder name inside the zip file 'tools' in the path?
2011-07-06T16:01:24  <mleise> *remove "in the path" :p
2011-07-06T16:01:53  <mleise> and why are there temorary files in it?
2011-07-06T16:02:08  <mleise> no this was zipped up on someone's working copy
2011-07-06T16:02:20  <mcstar> sure
2011-07-06T16:02:30  <mcstar> who said it wasnt?
2011-07-06T16:02:52  <mleise> You said something about selection the compression filter on github :p
2011-07-06T16:02:58  <mleise> *selecting
2011-07-06T16:03:05  <mcstar> on github, not on the beta site
2011-07-06T16:03:27  <mcstar> i think the beta site should directly link to github
2011-07-06T16:03:31  <mleise> but I was clearly referring to the tools.zip on the beta site
2011-07-06T16:03:42  <mcstar> mleise: sorry then
2011-07-06T16:03:53  <mleise> mcstar: that's a good idea again

2011-07-06T16:09:26  <gobang> a version number for playgame/engine/sanddbox, etc would come handy
2011-07-06T16:09:29  <mcstar> now ill code and stop yapping
2011-07-06T16:09:38  <mleise> mcstar: you are probly right again, although I don't like the idea of php scripts, .gitignore, test cases etc to be in the zip
2011-07-06T16:10:49  <mcstar> mleise: yeah, use tar.gz instead
2011-07-06T16:11:04  <mleise> I'll write a little script that zips (windows) and tar.gzs (linux) the tools in a more slim fashion that can be used by whoever deploys the server software
2011-07-06T16:11:10  <mcstar> (yes, im  hilariously funny)
2011-07-06T16:11:35  <mcstar> that'd be fine
2011-07-06T16:11:53  <mleise> auto-updater client anyone? nah just kidding
2011-07-06T16:12:34  <mcstar> actually it would be super easy to implement with git
2011-07-06T16:12:53  <mleise> IF everyone participating had that installed.
2011-07-06T16:13:28  <mleise> Hey you can participate, but you need to install Python, Java and git. *g*
2011-07-06T16:13:40  <mcstar> not much
2011-07-06T16:13:56  <mcstar> for a contest, why not?
2011-07-06T16:14:05  <mcstar> you know you can unnstall things too :)
2011-07-06T16:14:10  <mleise> Have you never been a windows user mcstar?
2011-07-06T16:14:25  <mcstar> for 4? years?
2011-07-06T16:14:47  <mleise> hehe, didn't you feel the urge to just download that .exe and run it
2011-07-06T16:14:58  <mcstar> no :)
2011-07-06T16:15:14  <mleise> every game comes budled with Java and Python if they require it.
2011-07-06T16:15:29  <mleise> It's a crazy environment, same with gtk+
2011-07-06T16:15:57  <mcstar> i used cygwin briefly
2011-07-06T16:16:02  <mcstar> but it was ok
2011-07-06T16:16:06  <mleise> But yeah, this is a programmer's contest
2011-07-06T16:16:11  <mcstar> i used hte x server too i beleive
2011-07-06T16:16:51  <mleise> I installed either cygwin or mingw on my sister's laptop just to get the open source c++ compiler working for her uni projects
2011-07-06T16:17:08  <mleise> x server on windows?
2011-07-06T16:17:08  <mcstar> i used devc++
2011-07-06T16:17:48  <mcstar> cygwin has x server, for sure, you can start unix graphical programs
2011-07-06T16:17:57  <mleise> mcstar: Well, she only had to edit a few lines. I don't know if I installed any IDE
2011-07-06T16:18:16  <mleise> mcstar: so it is like wine?
2011-07-06T16:18:20  <mcstar> ah right, decpp needed a compiler
2011-07-06T16:18:46  <mcstar> i guess it was mingw if its gnu
2011-07-06T16:18:53  <mcstar> mleise: what do you mean?
2011-07-06T16:18:57  <mcstar> what is cygwin?
2011-07-06T16:19:21  <mcstar> it runs natively on windows, compiled to exe's
2011-07-06T16:19:22  <mleise> cygwin sounds like wine. exposing the other os' api to the host
2011-07-06T16:19:46  <mcstar> its like a ports system for windows
2011-07-06T16:19:58  <mcstar> but it doesnt compile from source, instead it has binaries
2011-07-06T16:20:17  <mcstar> like a little package manager for windows providing gnu sweetness
2011-07-06T16:21:21  <mleise> ok, its a bit mind twisting to imagine something like pidgin running either in windows or in windows through the ported xserver

2011-07-06T16:22:12  <mleise> i guess it's a matter of where you start to abstract. at the graphics server level or at the widget level
2011-07-06T16:22:20  <mcstar> how deep ssh tunnels did you use before? :)
2011-07-06T16:22:32  <mleise> 1 layer mcstar
2011-07-06T16:23:04  <mcstar> reverse ssh-ing with 3 machines is mind twisting
2011-07-06T16:23:12  <mleise> and I usually start to write up guis to automate mind twisting tasks quickly
2011-07-06T16:23:22  <mcstar> of course it isnt, i just forget the correct sequence
2011-07-06T16:23:42  <mcstar> i wrote a nice ssh tunnel and connection manager in bash
2011-07-06T16:23:53  <mcstar> but its lost now
2011-07-06T16:23:57  <mleise> hm can you connect from A to B to C to A to B to C to B to C to A?
2011-07-06T16:24:09  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-06T16:24:18  <mleise> i didn't want to know
2011-07-06T16:24:23  <mcstar> but not with 1 command
2011-07-06T16:24:45  <mcstar> but you could redirect input/output mltiple times
2011-07-06T16:26:18  <mleise> ok I think I'm going to work on my bot again, now that I beat Uru.
2011-07-06T16:26:59  <mcstar> Uruguay?

2011-07-06T16:40:21  <Zalama> yea but thing is that you use = to define something and == when comparing.. so you don't actually need them both

2011-07-06T16:44:46  <mcstar> ah sorry, flagcapper not janzert
2011-07-06T16:44:52  <mleise> Zalama: programmers need to proof that they are required by inventing their own layer of complicated over simple things

2011-07-06T16:46:47  <mcstar> are you House?
2011-07-06T16:46:51  <mleise> ^^
2011-07-06T16:47:08  <mleise> what is House?
2011-07-06T16:47:16  <mcstar> House, M.D.
2011-07-06T16:47:18  <mcstar> Dr. House?
2011-07-06T16:47:32  <mcstar> what is Uru? Uruguay :D
2011-07-06T16:47:32  <mleise> i have seen that only twice
2011-07-06T16:47:54  <mleise> I thought "at home", "listening to house music"
2011-07-06T16:47:58  <Zalama> Still cant get my random generator to work :(
2011-07-06T16:48:00  <mcstar> well, House knows everything, your reactions too

2011-07-06T16:48:45  <mcstar> Zalama: what is not working exactly?
2011-07-06T16:49:02  <Zalama> Honestly I have no idea
2011-07-06T16:49:10  <Zalama> It worked like charm seperatelly
2011-07-06T16:49:23  <mcstar> (the funny thing is that i have my headphones on my head, and theres no music for like an hour now)
2011-07-06T16:49:42  <Zalama> I guess I'm not implementing it to starter bot right
2011-07-06T16:50:07  <mcstar> Zalama: you are not making me understand your problem
2011-07-06T16:50:24  <Zalama> Well problem is I don't understand it either :)
2011-07-06T16:50:25  <mcstar> send the output to stderr
2011-07-06T16:50:39  <mcstar> use playgame.py with -e -E options
2011-07-06T16:50:43  <mcstar> and see what happends

2011-07-06T16:55:22  <mcstar> is there anything else in the loop?

2011-07-06T16:56:46  <mcstar> you keep opening up the same file?
2011-07-06T16:56:54  <mcstar> fopen should be outside of it
2011-07-06T16:57:04  <mcstar> do you close it?
2011-07-06T16:57:09  <Zalama> no
2011-07-06T16:57:16  <mcstar> put stderr into fprintf

2011-07-06T16:57:30  <mleise> mcstar: amstan wrote a makefile that creates tools.zip. But I think it is evil, trying to remove all downloaded stuff from the visualizer working copy. (Like external source code I use from mozilla, java script compiler etc)
2011-07-06T16:57:58  <mcstar> they often say, amstel is the root of all evil
2011-07-06T16:58:01  <escortkeel> I think i've found a bug in the engine.
2011-07-06T16:58:08  <escortkeel> i'm probly wrong though,
2011-07-06T16:58:31  <mcstar> escortkeel: dont keep us waiting what is it?
2011-07-06T16:58:42  <escortkeel> It times out after my bot prints "go" and finishes it's turn
2011-07-06T16:58:44  <escortkeel> that is
2011-07-06T16:58:51  <escortkeel> it will time out one
2011-07-06T16:58:53  <escortkeel> once
2011-07-06T16:59:01  <mleise> escortkeel: -.- flush your stdout
2011-07-06T16:59:21  <escortkeel> i'll check that, thanks
2011-07-06T16:59:27  <mleise> ;-)
2011-07-06T16:59:41  <Zalama> anyway.. doing that open outside for doesn't make any difference
2011-07-06T16:59:53  <Zalama> since there isn't yet anything to loop (only one ant)
2011-07-06T16:59:57  <sir_macelon> Zalama: you need first to seend the rng
2011-07-06T17:00:00  <mcstar> Zalama: didnt i say to change it to stderr?
2011-07-06T17:00:06  <sir_macelon> *seed
2011-07-06T17:00:08  <Zalama> I have seeded it
2011-07-06T17:00:22  <Zalama> srand(time(NULL));
2011-07-06T17:00:39  <sir_macelon> you should you player_seed for that
2011-07-06T17:00:43  <mcstar> sir_macelon: rand shouldnt produce the same numbers seeded/not seeded
2011-07-06T17:00:51  <mcstar> only the same sequence between runs
2011-07-06T17:00:56  <sir_macelon> mcstar: seed it can

2011-07-06T17:01:40  <escortkeel> Hey i've just come back from checking my bot's flush and it does:
2011-07-06T17:01:45  <escortkeel> System.out.println("go");System.out.flush();
2011-07-06T17:02:59  <mcstar> sir_macelon: come on, i just put it in a .c file, and it gives different numbers :)
2011-07-06T17:03:32  <sir_macelon> mcstar: unseeded?
2011-07-06T17:03:40  <mcstar> or seeded, doesnt matter

2011-07-06T17:04:01  <mcstar> the seed is only necessary to give different sequences
2011-07-06T17:04:16  <mcstar> so you need different numbers to seed, thats why you use time or wtf ever
2011-07-06T17:04:44  <mcstar> but any two subseqent calls to rand() should give different number

2011-07-06T17:05:18  <sir_macelon> oh, now i checked it, it happens if you seed it more than once
2011-07-06T17:05:32  <sir_macelon> Zalama: make sure you call srand only once
2011-07-06T17:05:39  <mcstar> if you seed it again and againwith the same number, yes
2011-07-06T17:05:49  <sir_macelon> not every turn, but only during the setup on turn 0
2011-07-06T17:06:17  <mcstar> seeded only 2 times? gives the same number over and over again?

2011-07-06T17:08:41  <sir_macelon> mcstar: what is not true?
2011-07-06T17:10:50  <jmreardon> sir_macelon: seeding the rng more than once should not generally cause the same number to be generated repeatedly
2011-07-06T17:11:33  <sir_macelon> jmreardon: but it can and it happens as you can see
2011-07-06T17:11:38  <jmreardon> the problem in that forum post was probably because the function was called multiple times in a single second
2011-07-06T17:12:24  <jmreardon> time(NULL) only gives you second resolution
2011-07-06T17:12:42  <mcstar> sir_macelon: the poster got the same SEQUENCE of numbers every time the called his random function
2011-07-06T17:13:04  <mcstar> and he was obviusly blind, cause he couldnt read the ansi specification
2011-07-06T17:13:33  <mcstar> using rand() together with srand() makes the both more like a "mathematical" function
2011-07-06T17:13:58  <mcstar> the same output, for the same arguments: the number of call, and the seed
2011-07-06T17:14:14  <escortkeel> obviously the seed was the same every time
2011-07-06T17:15:16  <mcstar> so i guess Zalman's problem lies somewhere in his loop, i guess he simply writes the same number out again and again
2011-07-06T17:15:24  <mcstar> but im not sure
2011-07-06T17:15:37  <mcstar> he doesnt want to provide us with the code
2011-07-06T17:16:16  <escortkeel> Well, i guess thats justified...

2011-07-06T17:23:59  <escortkeel> ?
2011-07-06T17:24:03  <escortkeel> is there any reason that it wouldn't be working

2011-07-06T17:28:07  <sir_macelon> you need to delete all those "%~dp" strings from the command manually

2011-07-06T17:45:44  <bhasker> hmm
2011-07-06T17:45:57  <bhasker> is the repository broken ?
2011-07-06T17:46:12  <bhasker> i just updated my aichallenge from upstream and ants.py flunks when trying to run the bot
2011-07-06T17:51:13  <mcstar> bhasker: you need a fresh python
2011-07-06T17:51:17  <mcstar> 2.7.X
2011-07-06T17:51:20  <bhasker> aah
2011-07-06T17:52:48  <bhasker> the bots have gotten quite sophisticated
2011-07-06T17:53:38  <bhasker> though i don't get it, rank on the profile page and the rankings page doesn't seem to match up
2011-07-06T17:53:41  <bhasker> my profile says 3
2011-07-06T17:53:42  <bhasker> oops
2011-07-06T17:53:43  <bhasker> 34
2011-07-06T17:53:50  <bhasker> but rankings page says 50 something
2011-07-06T17:54:34  <mcstar> profile says 34 are ahead of you
2011-07-06T17:54:45  <mcstar> means 34 players will play, before you come up for a game
2011-07-06T17:55:11  <bhasker> ooh
2011-07-06T17:55:18  <bhasker> it should probably not say rank* for that
2011-07-06T17:55:27  <bhasker> maybe like queue position or something
2011-07-06T17:55:34  <bhasker> or RankinQueue
2011-07-06T17:55:58  <bhasker> also how is the queue ordering being decided
2011-07-06T17:56:04  <bhasker> i see that some bots are getting more games than others
2011-07-06T17:56:27  <bhasker> how fast they defeat opponents/
2011-07-06T17:56:39  <bhasker> is that the criteria, so if a bot is in a game it doesn't get another game?
2011-07-06T17:56:53  <bhasker> since it looks like sir_macelon seems to get games way faster than anyone else
2011-07-06T17:58:06  <mcstar> bhasker: thats a lot of questions, and i dont know the answers, ill leave it for the others :)
2011-07-06T17:58:17  <bhasker> :)
2011-07-06T18:00:18  <bhasker> how is your bot doing mcstar
2011-07-06T18:00:39  <mcstar> i improved much upon it, so its now lower than ever
2011-07-06T18:00:43  <bhasker> haha
2011-07-06T18:00:46  <bhasker> always the problem
2011-07-06T18:01:04  <mcstar> i added some really good things to it
2011-07-06T18:01:18  <mcstar> but i didnt cover corner cases very much, so it sucks in general
2011-07-06T18:01:26  <mcstar> but in a couple of days i fix this
2011-07-06T18:01:39  <mcstar> then, i expect it to play quite good
2011-07-06T18:02:26  <mcstar> yesterday, i was doing it till 4 o'clock in the morning, and i left a bug somewhere, some ants still try to step on each other
2011-07-06T18:02:37  <mcstar> quite suicidal at the moment :S
2011-07-06T18:02:43  <bhasker> haha
2011-07-06T18:02:49  <bhasker> i forget your bots name
2011-07-06T18:03:24  <mcstar> thats ok

2011-07-06T19:53:01  <jmcarthur> any other compression formats i should add while i'm here?

2011-07-06T19:53:13  <jmcarthur> i've added tar.xz and tar.bz2
2011-07-06T19:53:29  <jbroman> jmcarthur: ar
2011-07-06T19:53:32  <jmcarthur> it already supports zip and tar.gz
2011-07-06T19:53:48  <jmcarthur> ar? don't think i've even heard of that
2011-07-06T19:53:53  <jbroman> jmcarthur: I'm kidding.
2011-07-06T19:54:05  <jbroman> It exists, but is not used for this purpose nowadays.
2011-07-06T19:54:07  <jmcarthur> oh old school

2011-07-06T19:54:37  <jmcarthur> honestly, these days tar can autodetect the compression
2011-07-06T19:54:49  <jmcarthur> i should just make it do that instead of having special cases
2011-07-06T19:55:01  <jmcarthur> well, i don't think it works for zip and such
2011-07-06T19:55:18  <jmcarthur> just things that you could theoretically make using the tar command

2011-07-06T20:09:43  <mleise> somehow the file-extension gets changed from tar.lzma to tar.tar
2011-07-06T20:09:48  <jmcarthur> o_O
2011-07-06T20:10:10  <jmcarthur> worksforme
2011-07-06T20:10:29  <jmcarthur> huh
2011-07-06T20:10:37  <jmcarthur> but untarring it isn't doing anything...
2011-07-06T20:11:21  <jmcarthur> err.... weird
2011-07-06T20:12:21  <mleise> jmcarthur: wtf? it created one of those xz archives you were talking about
2011-07-06T20:12:23  <jmcarthur> btw, what are the current resource constraints on the bots and are they / will they be listed anywhere?
2011-07-06T20:12:31  <jmcarthur> yes?
2011-07-06T20:12:33  <mleise> yes!
2011-07-06T20:12:43  <mleise> rename it to xz and see for yourself
2011-07-06T20:13:04  <jmcarthur> tar cJf foo.tar.xz [FILE]
2011-07-06T20:13:41  <jmcarthur> it won't decompress for me
2011-07-06T20:13:46  <jmcarthur> renamed or not
2011-07-06T20:14:51  <jmcarthur> tar xf foo.tar.xz
2011-07-06T20:14:58  <jmcarthur> the above two commands work for me with my own files
2011-07-06T20:15:12  <jmcarthur> just not with yours
2011-07-06T20:15:32  <jmcarthur> well, of course i just mean the second command, in the case of your file
2011-07-06T20:15:56  <mleise> tar xf tools.tar.xz works for me
2011-07-06T20:16:27  <jmcarthur> oh haha, it wrote into a directory i already had called "ants"
2011-07-06T20:16:32  <mleise> I should fall back to bzip if this is such an issue
2011-07-06T20:16:37  <jmcarthur> i hope it didn't destroy any of my stuff...
2011-07-06T20:16:56  <jmcarthur> for the record, it works without the rename too, i think
2011-07-06T20:17:00  <mleise> that's why I like gui file system explorers
2011-07-06T20:17:02  <jmcarthur> i just didn't realize it was doing this

2011-07-06T20:22:33  <mleise> hmm, what do MacOS X users download now?
2011-07-06T20:23:17  <jbroman> mleise: Typically .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 (or .dmg in some cases).
2011-07-06T20:23:34  <jbroman> I don't think the default unarchiver supports .tar.xz, but I've never tried.
2011-07-06T20:23:42  <mleise> ok so they can probably open the tar.xz file
2011-07-06T20:23:43  <jmcarthur> ^^ in fact, just make the linux one .tar.gz and you can use the same for both
2011-07-06T20:23:55  * jmcarthur has no idea about .xz
2011-07-06T20:24:50  <mleise> this looks like xz is supported, what do you think? http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBkQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fmacosx-binaries%2Fdownloads%2Fdetail%3Fname%3Dgpac-0.4.5.i386.bin.tar.xz&ei=svwUTsCxFJGPswbC1oywDw&usg=AFQjCNGvwQd-20OR-s7mNY_hkResRq78aQ

2011-07-06T20:26:56  <mleise> escortkeel: can you download the tools.zip again and tell me if it works for you now?
2011-07-06T20:27:03  <escortkeel> ok sure!
2011-07-06T20:27:05  <jmcarthur> dude, xz has special settings for various binary formats to preprocess them to increase redundancy
2011-07-06T20:27:05  <escortkeel> thanks
2011-07-06T20:27:06  <jbroman> Is use of xz widespread? I've almost never seen it.
2011-07-06T20:27:20  <jmcarthur> jbroman: well, it's the default for arch linux packages now
2011-07-06T20:27:49  <jmcarthur> jbroman: and i compress my initfs with it
2011-07-06T20:28:03  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't say it's widespread though
2011-07-06T20:28:08  <jmcarthur> just gaining in popularity
2011-07-06T20:28:18  <jbroman> I meant, do you often run across .tar.xz archives? I almost invariably see only gz and bz2.

2011-07-06T20:29:29  <jmcarthur> yeah gz and bz2 are vastly more popular
2011-07-06T20:29:58  <jbroman> I was just trying to ascertain whether I'm getting behind the times or not.

2011-07-06T20:30:29  <mleise> why am I putting Windows in front?
2011-07-06T20:31:20  <mleise> jbroman: can you use the tools package now? that would be awesome to know. I test Linux, you test MacOS X and escortkeel test the zip
2011-07-06T20:31:57  <jbroman> It extracts into a directory named ants.
2011-07-06T20:32:08  <jbroman> Which is mildly confusing (as convention is to match the name of the archive).
2011-07-06T20:32:16  <jbroman> Is that what it is supposed to do?
2011-07-06T20:32:54  <jmcarthur> i also found that confusing
2011-07-06T20:33:07  <jmcarthur> i was looking for a directory called tools
2011-07-06T20:33:08  <mleise> well that comes from exporting the git branch 'ants' I'll rename that back then.
2011-07-06T20:33:37  <jbroman> Anyhow, it extracts and I can run some Python scripts (though I've been busy and haven't bothered to learn the flags, the scripts run).
2011-07-06T20:34:56  <escortkeel> mleise: what is the visuliser.jar for?

2011-07-06T20:46:27  <escortkeel> oh ok, thanks
2011-07-06T20:46:35  <escortkeel> i think w_turn
2011-07-06T20:46:50  <escortkeel> is the turn the bot started winning at
2011-07-06T20:47:19  <mleise> ah that makes sense since it is also displayed on the web site
2011-07-06T20:47:23  <escortkeel> yeah
2011-07-06T20:47:40  <escortkeel> but r_turn says exatcly the same thing as w_trune
2011-07-06T20:47:54  <escortkeel> and c_turns always reads 0...

2011-07-06T21:42:49  <amstan> bug how?
2011-07-06T21:42:55  <amstan> the problem is that ant crashes

2011-07-06T21:43:10  <amstan> i had that happen
2011-07-06T21:43:16  <amstan> it's that java memory error again
