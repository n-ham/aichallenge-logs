2011-11-23T10:29:26  <g0llum> i'm still waiting for someone hacking the university network into a hive mind playing on tcp..
2011-11-23T10:31:26  <mcstar> most of us have access to clusters, so why hack?
2011-11-23T10:32:01  <g0llum> i have a cluster of 2 and a half.
2011-11-23T10:34:12  <mcstar> i have access to ~10 fermi gpu's and say 80 xenon core
2011-11-23T10:34:19  <userjjb> What's the max allowed memory usage for a bot?
2011-11-23T10:34:34  <mcstar> on a supermicro workstation ~ 48 gb
2011-11-23T10:34:39  <g0llum> mcstar , ;) go for it !
2011-11-23T10:35:05  <g0llum> userjjb, like 2 gb
2011-11-23T10:35:10  <userjjb> ok
2011-11-23T10:35:17  <mcstar> efficiently using such a system, would require way too much work
2011-11-23T10:35:38  <mcstar> and probably wouldnt let me to run a "bot" anyway
2011-11-23T10:36:05  <mcstar> 2? not 1 gb?
2011-11-23T10:36:10  <g0llum> k, ok, my thoughts just running wild there ..

2011-11-23T11:07:29  <mcstar> 0%max?
2011-11-23T11:07:31  <avdg> value should be in range max, but its allowed to be negative as positive
2011-11-23T11:07:44  <g0llum> advg, you never imagine, that all your hives aer gone ?
2011-11-23T11:07:50  <avdg> (and I don't want to keep it negative or positive)
2011-11-23T11:08:08  <avdg> meh, I don't care about bot performance atm
2011-11-23T11:08:15  <avdg> I'm more worried about my c++ skills
2011-11-23T11:09:00  <avdg> about the expression: looks like I still have that division by zero
2011-11-23T11:09:33  <mcstar> i think 0%anything is 0
2011-11-23T11:10:02  <avdg> yeah
2011-11-23T11:10:02  <pairofdice> Yea
2011-11-23T11:10:15  <mcstar> shouldnt you be more worried about max not being 0?
2011-11-23T11:10:19  * avdg checks his variables
2011-11-23T11:10:27  <g0llum> if anythinf is 0, that's dividing by zero
2011-11-23T11:10:41  <avdg> yeah, I got it...

2011-11-23T11:10:57  <g0llum> hehe
2011-11-23T11:11:01  <avdg> using it before its declared
2011-11-23T11:11:16  <avdg> and no errors
2011-11-23T11:11:27  <avdg> I'm probably relying too much on them atm
2011-11-23T11:11:40  <mcstar> declared?
2011-11-23T11:11:48  <mcstar> that throws a compile time error
2011-11-23T11:11:55  <avdg> bleh declared/defined
2011-11-23T11:11:59  <mcstar> not the same
2011-11-23T11:12:15  <mcstar> so x is not initilized before you use it?
2011-11-23T11:12:37  <avdg> max was not set
2011-11-23T11:12:44  <avdg> it doesn't matter for x

2011-11-23T12:12:36  <UncleVasya> Are bots on TCP much stronger than top20 on the official server?
2011-11-23T12:12:38  <thestinger> every day my bot goes down 10 in the tcp server rankings and I have to improve it to climb back up
2011-11-23T12:13:21  <thestinger> UncleVasya: well, it's where a lot of them test/run their new versions
2011-11-23T12:13:31  <thestinger> the bots on the site are mostly ancient
2011-11-23T12:13:45  <thestinger> and you get a huge amount of time for your turn on the tcp server
2011-11-23T12:14:12  <thestinger> so if people have some sort of game tree/payoff matrix thing they are going to be much stronger
2011-11-23T12:14:45  <g0llum> knapsack01 ?
2011-11-23T12:18:29  <thestinger> luckily most improvements to my bot just involve running a bunch of versions to find the best constant/equation for something

2011-11-23T13:50:30  <praveen> thestinger: Do you use game tree/minimax ?
2011-11-23T13:52:22  <thestinger> not atm
2011-11-23T13:52:29  <thestinger> rewriting combat right now though
2011-11-23T13:52:56  <thestinger> the current bots playing on the tcp server just assume the enemy doesn't move
2011-11-23T13:53:05  <thestinger> my combat branch knows they might move
2011-11-23T13:53:54  <praveen> Ok strcat_dense is really doing well, so was wondering if its using gametree
2011-11-23T13:54:12  <thestinger> nope, it's just a bugfix for movement
2011-11-23T13:54:12  <praveen> that really answers what proper foraging and little defense could do.
2011-11-23T13:54:37  <thestinger> well, my combat basically just rips apart the static defenses - if they are exposed
2011-11-23T13:54:58  <thestinger> in a small area where it can't surround them it will just result in a stalemate
2011-11-23T13:54:59  <praveen> what is the name of the bot, combat branch one
2011-11-23T13:55:06  <thestinger> not running on the server yet
2011-11-23T13:55:10  <praveen> ok
2011-11-23T13:55:12  <thestinger> all of them can deal with unmoving enemies tho
2011-11-23T13:55:39  <thestinger> strcat_combatzones was my old combat branch but it never worked
2011-11-23T13:55:47  <praveen> ok got to implement them, still in early stages
2011-11-23T13:55:51  <thestinger> it just took a lot longer to do the same thing as strcat_rewrite
2011-11-23T13:56:06  <thestinger> and I mean 300ms instead of 4ms to do the same thing xD
2011-11-23T13:56:42  <praveen> from 300ms to 4ms is impressive
2011-11-23T13:57:00  <Minthos> from 4 ms to 300 ms is not
2011-11-23T13:57:11  <thestinger> ^ yeah, that
2011-11-23T13:57:16  <praveen> oh sorry :)
2011-11-23T13:57:39  <praveen> we can still call that impressive

2011-11-23T14:14:35  <thestinger> well, I think the max size for the zip is 2MB
2011-11-23T14:14:51  <thestinger> and there's probably a compilation time limit
2011-11-23T14:15:54  <LouisMartin> ok, do you remember where you've read that or heard that from?
2011-11-23T14:16:05  <pairofdice> On this channel from the admins
2011-11-23T14:17:06  <thestinger> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py
2011-11-23T14:17:14  <thestinger> looks like the default timelimit is 600 secs (10 mins)
2011-11-23T14:17:47  <thestinger> so, don't include the linux kernel in your bot :P
2011-11-23T14:17:48  <pairofdice> 2MB compressed text is something like 8MB?

2011-11-23T14:19:17  <LouisMartin> thanks for the info thestinger
2011-11-23T14:19:57  <thestinger> iirc, you can get ask for more than 2MB if you need it (I think I read that on the forum)
2011-11-23T14:20:22  <LouisMartin> pairofdice: depends on many factors, but could be a lot. 8 mb sounds normal, yep

2011-11-23T15:56:23  <pairofdice> Not much
2011-11-23T15:56:39  <mcstar> i think its an umbrella for quite similar methods
2011-11-23T15:57:28  <Rinum> seems like that collaborative diffusion article is total bs
2011-11-23T15:57:35  <Rinum> just a rip off of influence maps

2011-11-23T16:00:04  <mcstar> but i came across some pretty old stuff on influence maps
2011-11-23T16:00:08  <mcstar> some decades old
2011-11-23T16:00:20  <Rinum> http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/artificial-intelligence/the-core-mechanics-of-influence-mapping-r2799
2011-11-23T16:00:21  <Rinum> right
2011-11-23T16:00:36  <Rinum> that one is fairly recent i think?
2011-11-23T16:00:39  <mcstar> and similar stuff appears in papers from 70's
2011-11-23T16:00:48  <mcstar> but i think they dont call it that
2011-11-23T16:01:24  <Rinum> yeah
2011-11-23T16:01:28  <mcstar> i linked that page in ~2 weeks ago?
2011-11-23T16:02:02  <mcstar> btw, the area graphs are more interesting in that article than the influence stuff
2011-11-23T16:02:10  <mcstar> no that it tells much about anything
2011-11-23T16:02:27  <mcstar> well, ok, it has a code snippet
2011-11-23T16:02:32  <mcstar> i forgot about that
2011-11-23T16:02:59  <mcstar> i stripped my bot of any kind of influence stuff weeks ago

2011-11-23T16:04:05  <mcstar> but for the precision stuff im doing now its unacceptable
2011-11-23T16:04:17  <mcstar> but i can imagine using it for some global stuff
2011-11-23T16:04:22  <Rinum> so I'm guessing you're sticking to good old fashioned path-finding?

2011-11-23T16:04:51  <mcstar> i always had pathfinding

2011-11-23T16:05:24  <mcstar> the tree is too shallow to call it anything like that

2011-11-23T16:05:36  <mcstar> but its outcome-enumeration, yes
2011-11-23T16:05:39  <Rinum> well right, it'd have to be some variation of it

2011-11-23T16:40:50  <mcstar> i got it
2011-11-23T16:41:01  <mcstar> it has much diagonal lines
2011-11-23T16:41:03  <pairofdice> That looks like the lower intestine
2011-11-23T16:41:09  <mcstar> thats why i like that map(the water)
2011-11-23T16:41:52  <mcstar> McLeopold: youre not kidding?
2011-11-23T16:42:06  <mcstar> what would be the purpose of that?
2011-11-23T16:42:24  <mcstar> its like before hills, when ants could spawn from anywhere
2011-11-23T16:42:26  <McLeopold> I am kidding, but it would be interesting
2011-11-23T16:42:40  <Minthos> McLeopold: the map would initially be filled with ants then, and most of them would die instantly
2011-11-23T16:42:51  <mcstar> no
2011-11-23T16:42:53  <mcstar> not most of them
2011-11-23T16:42:55  <McLeopold> all would
2011-11-23T16:42:57  <mcstar> only on boundaries
2011-11-23T16:43:04  <mcstar> why?
2011-11-23T16:43:07  <Minthos> depends how the hills are distributed
2011-11-23T16:43:21  <McLeopold> on every single square
2011-11-23T16:43:28  <mcstar> no heaans by hives
2011-11-23T16:43:31  <a1k0n> i like
2011-11-23T16:43:32  <mcstar> he means*
2011-11-23T16:43:34  <McLeopold> I guess you'd have to hope all ants around you collieded
2011-11-23T16:43:48  <Minthos> yes but teams together or randomly placed?
2011-11-23T16:44:14  <McLeopold> and that, if you had a chuck of your own hills together

2011-11-23T16:48:28  <amstan> like.. water blocks in a grid, 4x4 repeating grid
2011-11-23T16:48:53  <McLeopold> them we can fool the 2 bots that try to detect symmetry...
2011-11-23T16:49:09  <amstan> i'm sure quite a few detect symmetry
2011-11-23T16:49:37  <a1k0n> except they wouldn't be fooled as soon as they find a single inconsistency

2011-11-23T17:57:43  <BenJackson> whereas something like A* would be very hard to parallelize because of the interdependence of each step on the next

2011-11-23T18:01:17  <Rinum> that's true
2011-11-23T18:01:22  <avdg> I'm more probably more interested in learning the hardware atm :p

2011-11-23T18:03:02  <mcstar> the key is to find a way to use max processing power while maximizing memory throughput
2011-11-23T18:03:57  <mcstar> this sounds too general...
2011-11-23T18:04:12  *** treeform <treeform!~treeform@108.60.121.46> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-11-23T18:04:25  <mcstar> but really, you must consider memory efficiency very seriously
2011-11-23T18:04:41  <mcstar> you must do enough computations while memory is being fetched
2011-11-23T18:04:46  <avdg> pre-optimalization atm for me
2011-11-23T18:05:23  <Rinum> I'll remember that, thanks
2011-11-23T18:06:00  <BenJackson> I worked on early NUMA machines.  Those lead to some interesting algorithms due to memory cost
2011-11-23T18:06:02  <avdg> it would probably more efficient to make the code breakable into units
2011-11-23T18:06:15  <avdg> and each unit care about their own variables
2011-11-23T18:06:24  *** treeform <treeform!~treeform@108.60.121.46> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-23T18:06:41  <mcstar> i always forget that acronym
2011-11-23T18:06:53  <mcstar> nn uniform...
2011-11-23T18:06:58  <mcstar> mamemory access
2011-11-23T18:07:00  <mcstar> f
2011-11-23T18:07:05  <BenJackson> non uniform memory access
2011-11-23T18:07:57  <BenJackson> modern multi-chip intel stuff is actually all NUMA now (because the memory controller is in the CPU now) but the difference between remote and local memory access is small enough that most people don't care
2011-11-23T18:08:43  *** treeform <treeform!~treeform@108.60.121.46> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-11-23T18:08:47  <BenJackson> In the early days when the remote memory was truly remote (accessible across some kind of bus or ring) it could be 100x or even 1000x worse to access remote memory
2011-11-23T18:09:33  <BenJackson> so imagine algorithms where the answer you want is already in memory but it's actually cheaper to recompute it
2011-11-23T18:09:45  <Rinum> interesting
2011-11-23T18:10:18  <mcstar> gpu global memory has some hundred times latency of the on-chip mem
2011-11-23T18:10:58  <mcstar> BenJackson: i guess there was some kiind of cache still?
2011-11-23T18:11:05  <BenJackson> oh yeah
2011-11-23T18:11:19  <BenJackson> "cc-NUMA" is "cache coherent NUMA"
2011-11-23T18:11:20  <BenJackson> most people drop the cc
2011-11-23T18:11:53  <mcstar> gpu texture memory isnt coherent within kernel calls
2011-11-23T18:12:06  <BenJackson> coherency is expensive
2011-11-23T18:12:23  <BenJackson> for one thing if someone has your memory cached remotely now your invalidate incurs the remote access penalty
2011-11-23T18:12:56  <mcstar> BenJackson: are you familiar with clojure's concurrency solution?
2011-11-23T18:13:08  <BenJackson> no, not familiar with clojure
2011-11-23T18:13:31  <mcstar> it has a multi-version software concurrency control mechanism or whatnot
2011-11-23T18:13:49  <BenJackson> ah
2011-11-23T18:13:50  <mcstar> it manages to keep a consistent state of data among threads
2011-11-23T18:14:00  <BenJackson> I thought about doing something like that for another language
2011-11-23T18:14:11  <mcstar> it might not be "current" but its consistent
2011-11-23T18:14:13  <BenJackson> basically I wanted to make a bunch of threads think they were still alone
2011-11-23T18:14:30  <BenJackson> by determining when they did dependent things and then unwinding the lower
2011-11-23T18:14:32  <BenJackson> *loser
2011-11-23T18:14:49  <BenJackson> and if that happened a few times by actual locking
2011-11-23T18:14:50  <mcstar> BenJackson: just like in time warp os?
2011-11-23T18:15:19  <BenJackson> not familiar with that
2011-11-23T18:15:47  <BenJackson> ah, yes, exactly like that
2011-11-23T18:16:08  <mcstar> http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/reiher/Time_Warp.html
2011-11-23T18:16:21  <mcstar> i saw an interview with beckman
2011-11-23T18:16:56  <mcstar> i forgot his full name
2011-11-23T18:17:12  <BenJackson> the cleverest application I've heard about of that principle is the apple lisa
2011-11-23T18:17:18  <mcstar> brian beckman
2011-11-23T18:17:22  <BenJackson> it had a MC68000 which does not support the  68881 MMU
2011-11-23T18:17:33  <BenJackson> so if you fault it can't restart an instructino
2011-11-23T18:17:39  <BenJackson> (like a 68020+ could)
2011-11-23T18:17:50  <BenJackson> so they put in two and ran the same thing on both
2011-11-23T18:17:53  <BenJackson> with one 1 clock behind
2011-11-23T18:17:59  <mcstar> o if you fault it can't rest
2011-11-23T18:18:16  <BenJackson> when the frontrunner faulted they'd take the fault and resume execution on the one that was behidn
2011-11-23T18:18:19  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-11-23T18:18:19  <BenJackson> and then trade places
2011-11-23T18:18:32  <mcstar> was 1 intruction enough?
2011-11-23T18:19:23  <BenJackson> the problem was just that it couldn't restart the faulting instruction
2011-11-23T18:19:37  <BenJackson> so eg "load from 0x1000" causing a fault would resume at the next instruction not having loaded
2011-11-23T18:20:05  <BenJackson> ah it was th '010 that added vm support
2011-11-23T18:20:23  <BenJackson> oops the mmu was the 68851
2011-11-23T18:22:47  <mcstar> lol

2011-11-23T18:25:25  <BenJackson> somewhy.com?
2011-11-23T18:26:16  <mcstar> ah, no, i meant i couldnt find it in the dictionary
2011-11-23T18:26:30  <BenJackson> huh, somehow I went up to 18th on aichallenge.  I think some top bots must be resubmitting
2011-11-23T18:26:58  <mcstar> yeah, back to coding...

2011-11-23T18:35:25  <amstan> like some use tabs
2011-11-23T18:35:50  <amstan> and on empty lines, they do it like i do, they don't just leave the line empty, but keep the tabs in

2011-11-23T20:39:26  <BenJackson> I think there's a bit of RPS here
2011-11-23T20:39:52  <avdg> which rps?
2011-11-23T20:39:56  <BenJackson> "semi-ignorant aggression" (which is how I'd characterize my current aichallenge submission)  is pretty effective
2011-11-23T20:40:14  <BenJackson> if you gather well it's going to do well against any low-end bots or bots which make mistakes or lack strong defense
2011-11-23T20:40:27  <BenJackson> but it does poorly against near-perfect-combat bots which can absorb the attacks
2011-11-23T20:40:39  <BenJackson> but near-perfect-combat implies some timidity
2011-11-23T20:40:54  <BenJackson> and the timidity does poorly against everything else but other near-perfect-combat bots
2011-11-23T20:41:13  <roflmao> I've been trying to do the near-perfect-combat thing
2011-11-23T20:41:15  <roflmao> can't get it nailed down
2011-11-23T20:41:19  <roflmao> too difficult
2011-11-23T20:41:41  <BenJackson> so near-perfect-combat beats semi-ignorant-aggression in 1v1, but if you are on the same map together the aggressive bot will probably take other hills and score more points
2011-11-23T20:42:15  <BenJackson> I think the combat rules for this challenge are kind of poor
2011-11-23T20:42:27  <BenJackson> it would have been hard to see it when they were chosen
2011-11-23T20:42:45  <BenJackson> but I think the problem is that the problem isn't "hard" enough to prevent everyone from "solving" it
2011-11-23T20:43:06  <BenJackson> and two bots with "solved" combat just stalemate mostly
2011-11-23T20:43:21  <BenJackson> or they just have to suicide each other

2011-11-23T23:45:55  <rajanaresh> hey guys, I want to know what kind of algorithms are people using to explore. I mean I see the top player's bots and their ants seem to know what they are doing and where they are going right from the time they spawn. My bot is so naive I used brownian motion to explore unless you see a food or enemy ant hill in which case there is pick and attack strategy respectively. How do those top bot's ants know exactly where they are goin
2011-11-23T23:46:15  <rajanaresh> How are those bots keeping track of what is explored and what is to be explored in the map?
2011-11-23T23:46:55  <antimatroid> rajanaresh: i just have a "lastSeen" int in each square
2011-11-23T23:47:00  <roflmao> that's easy rajanaresh
2011-11-23T23:47:07  <roflmao> keeping track of what is explored and what is to be explored
2011-11-23T23:47:13  <roflmao> the algorithms the top bots use are more complex
2011-11-23T23:47:25  <roflmao> they use some sort of flood fill from the edges to keep the distribution even
2011-11-23T23:47:37  <roflmao> if you just hunt unexplored tiles you tend to get a kind of "directional" pattern
2011-11-23T23:47:43  <roflmao> like a snake that goes across the maze
2011-11-23T23:47:53  <roflmao> if you instead use some sort of edge flood fill system
2011-11-23T23:47:57  <antimatroid> i have a function to meet enemy ants as soon as possible on one of the enemies shortest paths to my hills
2011-11-23T23:48:01  <roflmao> you get a "dissipation" thing going on
2011-11-23T23:48:04  <antimatroid> i like that :P
2011-11-23T23:48:15  <Antimony> I tried telling my bots to explore the closest unexplored square to the hill to get more even coverage, but it didn't work very well
2011-11-23T23:48:37  <roflmao> what I do is I first explore never seen tiles
2011-11-23T23:48:38  <antimatroid> do you reuse ants that have been used for exploring food collecting?
2011-11-23T23:48:39  <a1k0n> i just try to minimize the distance between all squares on the map and the nearest ants
2011-11-23T23:48:57  <a1k0n> it's a very.. calculus approach
2011-11-23T23:49:07  <roflmao> so you basically just go to the nearest unseen tile?
2011-11-23T23:49:15  <Antimony> but it's not a continuous function
2011-11-23T23:49:27  <a1k0n> basically but it's more subtle
2011-11-23T23:49:29  <bmh> I don't have a strategy, but I will have one.
2011-11-23T23:49:38  <a1k0n> i assume the probability food is present is proportional to lastSeen-turn
2011-11-23T23:49:44  <a1k0n> er, turn-lastSeen
2011-11-23T23:50:07  <roflmao> aaah
2011-11-23T23:50:08  <roflmao> interesting
2011-11-23T23:50:12  <a1k0n> and i try to maximize the likelihood of finding new food
2011-11-23T23:50:13  <roflmao> so if turn last seen is greater
2011-11-23T23:50:21  <roflmao> then that tile has preference
2011-11-23T23:50:21  <Antimony> anyway, in my current bot I just made my ants try to stay at least at least 3 away from each other, so they naturally disperse
2011-11-23T23:50:23  <antimatroid> that's pretty neat
2011-11-23T23:50:27  <Antimony> it works well except on dense mazes

2011-11-23T23:52:30  <antimatroid> i did my best to make it hard to exploit
2011-11-23T23:52:30  <bmh> BenJackson has, I think
2011-11-23T23:52:33  <a1k0n> you know, i keep talking about doing it but i haven't
2011-11-23T23:52:39  <a1k0n> i'm just going to implement it
2011-11-23T23:52:43  <bmh> before I try symmetry, I'm going to add basic triangulation
2011-11-23T23:52:48  <roflmao> it sounds very difficult though
2011-11-23T23:52:55  <a1k0n> the triangulation idea is super clever
2011-11-23T23:52:59  <bmh> translational symmetry is easy
2011-11-23T23:53:07  <roflmao> triangulation?
2011-11-23T23:53:07  <bmh> a1k0n: I'm a super clever guy ;)
2011-11-23T23:53:09  <antimatroid> rajanaresh: in turn 0 i calculate the translation values to get locatins within the view radius of a square then just stamp vision at the start of each turn
2011-11-23T23:53:18  <a1k0n> it'd help more than symmetry detection in the early game
2011-11-23T23:53:25  <antimatroid> a1k0n: :D
2011-11-23T23:53:28  <Antimony> what's triangulation?
2011-11-23T23:53:30  <bmh> roflmao: If you see an ant on turn N, you know that the enemy hill is no more than N steps away from where that ant is
2011-11-23T23:53:39  <Antimony> nice
2011-11-23T23:53:47  <Antimony> could be useful on multihill maps
2011-11-23T23:53:52  <roflmao> hahaha that's extremely clever
2011-11-23T23:53:55  <a1k0n> and if you see three ants from player b on turn N at totally different spots...
2011-11-23T23:54:03  <antimatroid> lol
2011-11-23T23:54:10  <bmh> Antimony: and you know how many hills there are because you can count your own hills!
2011-11-23T23:54:28  <antimatroid> you don't know the number of players :P
2011-11-23T23:54:42  <roflmao> bmh: NO WAY!
2011-11-23T23:54:46  <bmh> antimatroid: whatever. model it.
2011-11-23T23:54:48  <Antimony> It sounds nice in theory, but I think it's too much effort ot be worth it
2011-11-23T23:55:10  <roflmao> that level of triangulation sounds ridicueasy
2011-11-23T23:55:20  <antimatroid> Antimony: exploiting symmetry is VERY useful for pathfinding
2011-11-23T23:55:24  <antimatroid> which is a large component of the game
2011-11-23T23:55:26  <roflmao> although I don't see much of the triangle in it
2011-11-23T23:55:32  <Antimony> I'm talking about triangulation, not symmetry
2011-11-23T23:55:35  <antimatroid> and knowing enemy hill locations is useful
2011-11-23T23:55:37  <antimatroid> oh
2011-11-23T23:55:53  <rajanaresh> antimatroid: and you do that for every ant. Don't you think it's computationally expensive? I mean does it scale with more ants? Consider radius approximately 7 so you have approx. 49 squares for each ant to update. Is that what's happening?
2011-11-23T23:55:54  <Antimony> I do plan on doing symmetry once I get rudimentary combat working, if ever
2011-11-23T23:55:55  <bmh> roflmao: like a1k0n said -- if you see a couple of ants early enough in the game and far enough apart, you can pin-point their hill (approximately)
2011-11-23T23:56:03  <roflmao> ah
2011-11-23T23:56:10  <antimatroid> rajanaresh: computers are fast :)
2011-11-23T23:56:20  <Antimony> I think that the cases in which triangulation would be useful are very limted
2011-11-23T23:56:24  <roflmao> is that really going to give a boost though? at least in my personal experience
2011-11-23T23:56:24  <roflmao> yeah
2011-11-23T23:56:33  <roflmao> in my personal experience I usually find hills BEFORE I'm ready to attack them
2011-11-23T23:56:47  <roflmao> finding hills isn't that much of an issue
2011-11-23T23:56:54  <antimatroid> it might be with better bots later
2011-11-23T23:57:06  <Antimony> symmetry is much more effective at finding hills
2011-11-23T23:57:13  <antimatroid> i haven't implemented it yet but i plan to add into my combat to avoid an enemy seeing a particular hill for the first time
2011-11-23T23:57:32  <Antimony> lol
2011-11-23T23:57:44  <Antimony> maybe I should keep track of which players have seen my hills
2011-11-23T23:57:51  <antimatroid> not hard to do
2011-11-23T23:58:08  <Antimony> how do you know they didn't sneak an ant in in a place you can't see?
2011-11-23T23:58:12  <antimatroid> just add a set of locations to each square and insert an ant player when it's in range at the start of each turn :)
2011-11-23T23:58:19  <antimatroid> shit :P
2011-11-23T23:58:20  <Antimony> unless you keep the entire radius of your hill visible every turn
2011-11-23T23:58:35  <antimatroid> i plan to keep the radius visible when possible, but obviously not always the case
2011-11-23T23:58:40  <antimatroid> i guess you just go on what you do know
2011-11-23T23:58:44  <bmh> Antimony: I'm going to politely ask my ants to sacrifice themselves to stop someone from seeing my hill
2011-11-23T23:59:01  <antimatroid> bmh: his point was an enemy might see a hill without you knowing
2011-11-23T23:59:03  <Antimony> arrrg, there are so many features I need to implement
2011-11-23T23:59:06  <antimatroid> but you just assume it hasn't seen it then
2011-11-23T23:59:12  <bmh> antimatroid: yeah...
2011-11-23T23:59:14  <Antimony> but I'm held back because I still have no combat
2011-11-23T23:59:35  <antimatroid> my source files are like 2500 lines worth now :|
