2011-07-04T00:32:25  <antimatroid> mleise: i just remembered sometihng about my a* compared to sir_macelons
2011-07-04T00:32:58  <antimatroid> i'm retrieving my heuristic location from a set every time i run that, because it's set up for multiple targets
2011-07-04T00:33:02  <antimatroid> that could be slowing it down
2011-07-04T00:33:05  <antimatroid> i'll play around later
2011-07-04T00:33:46  <mleise> i see
2011-07-04T00:37:57  <antimatroid> weighted a* or just ordering by min h seems really promising though
2011-07-04T00:38:09  <antimatroid> for speed increases and minimal loss of optimality

2011-07-04T03:27:31  <ibdknox> that *should* mostly work, the problem is mainly that I can't prove it won't unzip it
2011-07-04T03:28:10  <ibdknox> since it won't*
2011-07-04T03:28:17  <VilleH> Doesn't work for c# either. I'm stuck in same message as ibdknox
2011-07-04T03:32:30  <aerique> have both of you tried uploading, for example, the java starter package and see if that works?
2011-07-04T03:33:33  <VilleH> Wait a sec, I'll try
2011-07-04T03:34:51  <VilleH> Doh, I need to wait some time as it seems that someone has put the 10min limit on uploads
2011-07-04T03:35:01  <ibdknox> it hasn't reset
2011-07-04T03:35:08  <ibdknox> I've been waiting just shy of an hour
2011-07-04T03:35:11  <ibdknox> so I can't upload again
2011-07-04T03:35:20  <ibdknox> some process must not be running
2011-07-04T03:35:20  <VilleH> :D
2011-07-04T03:35:42  <VilleH> Like I said, worker.py is probably dead and its not unzipping / testing those uploads
2011-07-04T03:35:49  <ibdknox> yeah
2011-07-04T03:36:52  <VilleH> aerique: anyway c# hasn't worked at all since I started, so I don't have currently own bot running on beta server. :(

2011-07-04T03:54:32  <antimatroid> haven't got around to working out what happened yet
2011-07-04T03:55:39  <mcstar> oh?
2011-07-04T03:56:01  <mcstar> how long is the optimal?
2011-07-04T03:56:16  <mcstar> rather "an" optimal
2011-07-04T03:56:39  <antimatroid> dunno, but i could see where it obviously twisted suboptimally in open space
2011-07-04T03:56:49  <antimatroid> i think min f then min h got the optimal path
2011-07-04T03:56:51  <antimatroid> did you get my link?
2011-07-04T03:56:57  <mcstar> wehn?

2011-07-04T03:58:14  <antimatroid> weighted a* and just min h got really crap paths, but i'll try that again once i work out what went wrong with normal a*
2011-07-04T03:58:34  <mcstar> ill check it in a minute
2011-07-04T03:58:58  <mcstar> antimatroid: could you pls in the future use tha exact map encoding that ANts uses?
2011-07-04T03:59:01  <antimatroid> mcstar: i also made a "path generator"
2011-07-04T03:59:10  <antimatroid> which will make situations on my maze maps for you to path find
2011-07-04T03:59:17  <antimatroid> you can add your ants, food, and enemy ants
2011-07-04T03:59:39  <antimatroid> mcstar: the path generator outputs in the map format :)
2011-07-04T03:59:46  <mcstar> ok

2011-07-04T04:13:39  <antimatroid> are they different maps?

2011-07-04T04:18:33  <antimatroid> was your path not optimal too?

2011-07-04T06:26:05  <VilleH> I think that they aren't official sponsors yet
2011-07-04T06:26:48  <eashoka> hmm sorry if that's a boring subject which has already got asked in here many times before. I'm still new here. :-) just liked to see the game server up..
2011-07-04T06:27:43  <eashoka> villeH: thought they were the official sponsor even in last year.
2011-07-04T06:29:38  <eashoka> even the HTML title of every page says 'Google AI challenge'. hmm .....
2011-07-04T06:30:31  <antimatroid> google did provide some server money for pw and may again for ants
2011-07-04T06:30:49  <antimatroid> but they are mostly a sponsor because it looks good for both parties :)
2011-07-04T06:31:29  <eashoka> ah so  I thought.... :-)
2011-07-04T06:32:29  <eashoka> if they are gonna provide some server money they better do it quick I think. otherwise this (poor servers going down under load frequently) doesn't look good for their name... ;-)
2011-07-04T06:32:57  <aerique> eashoka: we're still on the beta server
2011-07-04T06:35:25  <eashoka> aerique : yea, we know. Just providing you guys some ammo to use next time any of you meet up a google person :-)
2011-07-04T06:35:34  <mcstar> and the beta is thanks to demerzel as the site suggests...
2011-07-04T06:40:55  <VilleH> Any idea how powerful server do you usually need for this kind of contests?
2011-07-04T06:41:29  <eashoka> mcstar : exactly! (thanks demerzel!) it would be nice if google can help the important beta work too isn't it ? This is a very nicely done competion (too good for running on inadequate resources). Hope thousends would play in this year. This could easily be 'THE programming competion" (if not already)
2011-07-04T06:44:32  <VilleH> Hmm, what does -end_wait parameter on playgame?
2011-07-04T06:44:50  <mcstar> playgame.py waits for the bots to clean up their mess
2011-07-04T06:44:59  <mcstar> earlier, it killed them instantly :)
2011-07-04T06:45:50  <mcstar> VilleH: it will run in "the cloud"
2011-07-04T06:45:54  <mcstar> there is no server
2011-07-04T06:46:17  <mcstar> you get a process with recources of a modern day processor
2011-07-04T06:46:17  <eashoka> villeH : let's see. (ur  first qsn) one turn could take 1 second. so a game could take upto 1500 seconds or 25 minutes!
2011-07-04T06:47:37  <mcstar> eashoka: wiki mentions a name who supposed to be doing the "gather money" task
2011-07-04T06:47:37  <eashoka> if every body has to play at least one game in every 25 minutes then that means the cloud has to running a game involving a player contantly. one immediately after the next etc ...
2011-07-04T06:47:46  <mcstar> maybe he isnt doing it too good... i dont know
2011-07-04T06:47:55  <eashoka> amstan ?
2011-07-04T06:47:58  <mcstar> no
2011-07-04T06:48:52  <VilleH> mcstar: yeap, but is the current beta running on some ubuntu box?
2011-07-04T06:49:23  <eashoka> so, if there are n players and a single game can get involved 10 players, (let's say) then the servers should be powerful enough to run n/10 games parally at all times.
2011-07-04T06:49:25  <mcstar> j3camero
2011-07-04T06:49:38  <mcstar> oops, i dont want to wake him
2011-07-04T06:49:49  <mcstar> cloud again
2011-07-04T06:50:01  <mcstar> but a different subscription
2011-07-04T06:50:39  <eashoka> if n becomes 1000 (very likely) that means 100 games in parellal. what's more ppl would like to get involved in more than 1 game in 25 minutes. so something like the cpu power to run 200 games in parellal at any given time.
2011-07-04T06:51:16  <eashoka> in EC2 terms, how many instances one would need to run 200 games smoothly ?
2011-07-04T06:51:18  <mcstar> eashoka: the resources are dynamically allocated in a cload
2011-07-04T06:51:19  <VilleH> eashoka You can run even more games parallel as the next match doesn't depend on previous one?
2011-07-04T06:51:48  <eashoka> next mathc would depend on previous isn't it ? (to calculate ratings properly)
2011-07-04T06:51:49  <mcstar> i think every bot-thread gets 1 thread
2011-07-04T06:52:19  <mcstar> i think rating simply accumulate, the order shouldnt matter
2011-07-04T06:52:28  <mcstar> hell, i miss the s's
2011-07-04T06:52:49  <eashoka> mcstar, villeh : true. but what ever, there should be enough CPU/memory capacity to run about 200 games symultanously I think
2011-07-04T06:53:17  <eashoka> that would need few EC2 instances on the cloud
2011-07-04T06:53:34  <eashoka> msstar : ratings are used to pairings.
2011-07-04T06:54:04  <eashoka> mcstar: so I guess the order is important.
2011-07-04T06:54:05  <VilleH> I think ratings could be also done so that they are calculated once / day
2011-07-04T06:54:31  <eashoka> villeh : nope, u need quick feedback on your new version
2011-07-04T06:54:45  *** locutus2 <locutus2!~locutus2@62.152.161.149> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-04T06:54:58  <eashoka> villeh : can't improve the bots if you don't get frequent games and rating updates
2011-07-04T06:56:13  <VilleH> You could still get the games and see wins / losses, but your opponents could be based on ratings calculated based on previously
2011-07-04T06:56:39  <VilleH> But of course real time updates are better for the players in this kind of competition
2011-07-04T06:57:19  <eashoka> villeH : yeah, and I guess running 200 games is not a big deal for the cloud
2011-07-04T06:57:38  <eashoka> villeH : IF there is a sponsor that is :-)
2011-07-04T06:57:43  <antimatroid> we don't let all bots make their moves in the same time block
2011-07-04T06:57:53  <antimatroid> we use sigstop or whatever to pause processes
2011-07-04T06:58:30  <eashoka> antimatroid : but that means each game take more time to finish ?
2011-07-04T06:58:50  <antimatroid> eashoka: yes, but it means we give people a better idea of how much time they actually have each turn
2011-07-04T06:58:57  <eashoka> theoratically 1 game could go upto 1500 cpu seconds right ?
2011-07-04T06:59:16  <antimatroid> we could always significantly reduce the turn time to achieve basically the same thing, but doing so significantly reduces the number of cool strategies people can reasonably try out
2011-07-04T06:59:45  <eashoka> antimatroid : yeah agreed. at least 1 second is a must.
2011-07-04T06:59:55  <antimatroid> eventually there will be a tcp server where you will basically be able to constantly run games :)
2011-07-04T07:00:13  <eashoka> antimatroid : cool
2011-07-04T07:00:33  <antimatroid> mcstar: i'ma fix up my path finding output

2011-07-04T07:20:31  <mcstar> antimatroid: i backtrack by simplywalking on the visited(close set) squares
2011-07-04T07:20:40  <mcstar> it a struct with parent coordinates
2011-07-04T07:20:46  <mcstar> s
2011-07-04T07:20:49  <antimatroid> mcstar: i used the g information, but it breaks :\
2011-07-04T07:21:09  <mcstar> what do you mean how valid?
2011-07-04T07:21:21  <mcstar> it always finds one optimal route
2011-07-04T07:21:34  <mcstar> it must, if it doesnt, thats our mistake
2011-07-04T07:22:12  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=itCC5c5c
2011-07-04T07:22:31  <antimatroid> it's hard to see here, below the "below here" the search path goes below the visited squares
2011-07-04T07:22:39  <antimatroid> then goes around it, which gives my suboptimal path
2011-07-04T07:23:01  <antimatroid> when adding a node to the search queue i can scan the neighbours for min g but i'm still not sure if that will always work?
2011-07-04T07:23:26  <antimatroid> the reason this is happening is because either direction can decrease the estimated distance i think
2011-07-04T07:23:52  <antimatroid> in other words, my problem ( i think) is that the g calculations aren't always the min path to a search square as i'm currently doing it
2011-07-04T07:25:03  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=DFYChChG i added my g information at the bottom
2011-07-04T07:27:30  <antimatroid> any path finding experts about? \
2011-07-04T07:27:40  <antimatroid> sigh: what's your knowledge on path finding like?
2011-07-04T07:27:50  <antimatroid> do you know if a* should work on toroidal maps?
2011-07-04T07:28:09  <mcstar> well, the optimal path has got to touch the outline of the close set(the open set) and any square in the open set always points back to the parent, which gives the shortest path to the origin, so by indcution this schemes always finds an optimal path
2011-07-04T07:28:23  <mcstar> antimatroid: absoulutely
2011-07-04T07:28:28  <sigh> antimatroid: sure, why not
2011-07-04T07:28:57  <mcstar> the only difference that the open set can meet with itslef but its not a problem at all
2011-07-04T07:29:03  <mcstar> is that*
2011-07-04T07:29:03  <antimatroid> sigh: when i am searching, it seems to be searching around the shortest paths to some places, then getting sub optimal g values
2011-07-04T07:29:20  <antimatroid> which i think is due to the fact that both directions from a square can look like the decrease the heuristic value
2011-07-04T07:29:28  <sigh> is your heuristic admissible?
2011-07-04T07:30:00  <antimatroid> yes, i'm doing a single source and single target search with manhatten dist as the heuristic value
2011-07-04T07:30:02  <sigh> your heuristic needs to care about the toroidalness
2011-07-04T07:30:07  <antimatroid> let me ant paste the path it gets
2011-07-04T07:30:19  <mcstar> yes, always calc. the min distance
2011-07-04T07:30:23  <antimatroid> the manhatten distance wraps obviously if that's what you mean?
2011-07-04T07:30:30  <mcstar> but you it this way..

2011-07-04T07:31:20  <sigh> if you get a suboptimal path, it should be easy to debug
2011-07-04T07:31:34  <sigh> just look at the data-structure at the end, and see why the optimal path is scoring less

2011-07-04T07:33:36  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=DFYChChG the bottom map there gives my "g" information, you'll see where it breaks to the left of a, and i think the first search map with 's' == searched and 'v' == added to search queue sort of explains why it's getting the g information wrong

2011-07-04T07:35:32  <antimatroid> if i sorted by min f, then max h, it seemed to get it right, but that might have just been this case
2011-07-04T07:36:06  <sigh> something is broken in your algorithm
2011-07-04T07:36:42  <sigh> you did math, you should be able to prove a* for yourself :P
2011-07-04T07:37:45  <antimatroid> should a location i'm adding to my search queue always be found from a minimum path from the source?
2011-07-04T07:39:15  <sigh> yes
2011-07-04T07:40:04  <sigh> in your output where is goes from 9 to 12, something is broken
2011-07-04T07:40:26  <antimatroid> do you understand the above map?
2011-07-04T07:40:55  <antimatroid> the s goes below the v when searching, because it looks just as close if it walked down, searching around the shortest path on the up side
2011-07-04T07:41:50  <sigh> but why did it go up from 11 to 12, instead of going left from 9
2011-07-04T07:42:09  <antimatroid> becuase it searched from the 9 below and to the right first
2011-07-04T07:42:14  <antimatroid> going along the left below
2011-07-04T07:42:23  <sigh> the h(x) from 12 is a constant, and g(x) is shorter from 9 than from 11
2011-07-04T07:42:27  <antimatroid> hence the 12 got added from the 11 below before the top 9 was removed from the search queue
2011-07-04T07:42:54  <antimatroid> i'll do some calculations and see if i still think somethings not broken my end
2011-07-04T07:43:04  <sigh> you are adding things in the wrong order
2011-07-04T07:43:42  <antimatroid> it's pulling stuff off the search queue if it has the minimum expected path from source to target
2011-07-04T07:43:46  <antimatroid> isn't that what it's meant to do?
2011-07-04T07:44:09  <antimatroid> through the current locaiton it's pulling off

2011-07-04T07:48:04  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm writing out something on paper so i can work this out
2011-07-04T07:52:42  <antimatroid> i have h = 30 for both g(x)=9 locations
2011-07-04T07:52:57  <antimatroid> so it's arbitrarily picking the bottom one (because i go n, e, s, w)
2011-07-04T07:54:08  <antimatroid> i don't think my algorithm is broken :\
2011-07-04T07:54:21  <sigh> the 9 should have been expanded before 12
2011-07-04T07:54:44  <antimatroid> but what about the 11 below the 12?
2011-07-04T07:54:46  <sigh> otherwise 9+h(9) > 12+h(12) ==> 9+1+h(12) > 12+h(12) ==> 10+h(12) > 12+h(12)
2011-07-04T07:54:54  <antimatroid> if i expand that, then the 12 is added to the search queue
2011-07-04T07:55:02  <sigh> sure, but it in the queue
2011-07-04T07:55:03  <antimatroid> should i also be adding it to the search queue again?
2011-07-04T07:55:13  <sigh> no, 12 is just in the queue
2011-07-04T07:55:18  <sigh> you haven't reached it yet
2011-07-04T07:55:36  <antimatroid> so i update the g value for that when i come across the location again from the second 9? even though it's in the queue?
2011-07-04T07:56:21  <sigh> hang on
2011-07-04T07:57:08  <antimatroid> i think that'd work
2011-07-04T07:57:18  <sigh> ok, I see what you are going
2011-07-04T07:57:37  <sigh> you are declaring that a node is reached once it's in the queue (the open set)
2011-07-04T07:57:53  <antimatroid> yep, and assuming i found the shortest path there already
2011-07-04T07:58:21  <sigh> the whole point of the queue is so that you can tell the shortest path by the elements that make it to the front
2011-07-04T07:58:30  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-07-04T07:58:45  <antimatroid> i'd need to add the location again and either leave the old one or remove it
2011-07-04T07:58:49  <antimatroid> which is a bit painful
2011-07-04T07:59:00  <antimatroid> i might have to do the whole open/closed set implementation, but would that save me?
2011-07-04T07:59:22  <sigh> why can't you just add it to the queue?
2011-07-04T07:59:33  <sigh> don't mark the node or anything until it is in the closed set
2011-07-04T07:59:34  <antimatroid> and leave the other copy of it in the queue?
2011-07-04T07:59:44  <sigh> sure
2011-07-04T08:00:06  <sigh> unless you muck around with fancier data-structures, that seems perfectly valid
2011-07-04T08:00:32  <sigh> otherwise you need a priority queue where you can change the values and stuff.... too much hassel

2011-07-04T08:05:24  <sir_macelon> seems like a bug
2011-07-04T08:05:36  <sigh> if you want to guarantee that your open set is optimal, then you are stuck with plain BFS

2011-07-04T08:06:24  <sir_macelon> antimatroid: haven't you used the original algorithm from wiki?
2011-07-04T08:06:46  <antimatroid> no, i just read the intro and implemented it how i thought it worked :P

2011-07-04T08:10:13  <antimatroid> i'm here to learn
2011-07-04T08:10:35  <sir_macelon> but there's more interesting stuff in here than just path finding :)
2011-07-04T08:10:48  <antimatroid> my favourite part of these contests is playing around with these problems, even if they're previously been solved
2011-07-04T08:11:06  <antimatroid> sure, but path finding i've never properly played with
2011-07-04T08:11:19  <sir_macelon> i've just implemented it as in the wiki one day and just forgot about it :P
2011-07-04T08:11:37  <antimatroid> ahh, i have lots of plans for my path finding :P
2011-07-04T08:11:57  <sir_macelon> that's why you are working on those maze maps, ha? :)
2011-07-04T08:12:14  <antimatroid> :P
2011-07-04T08:12:44  <antimatroid> (i was told to make mazes for reference, but :P)
2011-07-04T08:12:53  <sir_macelon> speaking of those, when they will be available to test on the beta?
2011-07-04T08:13:08  <antimatroid> i think mcleopold wants to save them for the main launch
2011-07-04T08:13:18  <antimatroid> make the launch a bit more special?

2011-07-04T08:16:37  <antimatroid> yeah, and they sort of make sense for the context of the game

2011-07-04T08:19:12  <antimatroid> i think it's a "bug" that causes almost entire lines of water on the edges of symmetry, often with 1 width holes, but it's a bug i'm quite fond of

2011-07-04T08:26:57  <antimatroid> the maze generator is way faster than the old one though
2011-07-04T08:27:27  <antimatroid> unless you ask it to make a symmetric tile map with a specific number of players

2011-07-04T08:31:06  <mcstar> i dont reorder
2011-07-04T08:31:13  <mcstar> its a priority queue

2011-07-04T08:31:32  <antimatroid> ahh okay
2011-07-04T08:31:54  <antimatroid> i think i might leave the duplicates in there then just ignore them if they're closed when i pull them off
2011-07-04T08:32:48  <mcstar> you mean after updating to a smaller g-value?
2011-07-04T08:32:55  <mcstar> so you leave the old in?

2011-07-04T08:34:00  <mcstar> when you didnt find a path from the top of the queue, you will eventually encounter a replica of the popped ones
2011-07-04T08:34:35  <mcstar> let me think
2011-07-04T08:34:40  <antimatroid> yes, but then it will be marked closed and i can just skip over it
2011-07-04T08:36:13  <mcstar> ah, but thats another thing to check
2011-07-04T08:36:45  <mcstar> it might be faster that to always check another value like node.kind or something

2011-07-04T08:44:17  <jmcarthur> to change the subject slightly, i don't really "get" the python philosophy
2011-07-04T08:44:25  <sir_macelon> does anyone know why there are no games running on beta now?
2011-07-04T08:44:42  <antimatroid> because that's what most of the original people are used to?

2011-07-04T08:45:10  <jmcarthur> i mean in general. the rationale behind python design decisions and coding conventions
2011-07-04T08:45:16  <antimatroid> oh, i can't stand python
2011-07-04T08:45:19  <antimatroid> i think it's really messy

2011-07-04T08:45:38  <jmcarthur> "..."
2011-07-04T08:45:39  <antimatroid> probably doesn't help that i know almost none of it
2011-07-04T08:45:45  <jmcarthur> or rather...
2011-07-04T08:45:49  <jmcarthur> "there's only one right way to do it"
2011-07-04T08:45:53  <mcstar> i hate python because indentation can break your code
2011-07-04T08:46:07  <jmcarthur> i love indentation aware syntax, but not python's
2011-07-04T08:46:14  <jmcarthur> python does it wrong wrong wrong
2011-07-04T08:46:22  <mcstar> i heard haskell has some rules tooo
2011-07-04T08:46:27  <mcstar> im afarid of it
2011-07-04T08:46:32  <jmcarthur> haskell's syntax is indentation aware, yes
2011-07-04T08:46:43  <jmcarthur> but it doesn't suck
2011-07-04T08:46:53  <jmcarthur> it works on "blocks" instead of "indentation levels"
2011-07-04T08:47:17  <jmcarthur> so it cares more about whether things are aligned than whether they have n spaces more than other lines
2011-07-04T08:47:41  <antimatroid> python does that doesn't it?
2011-07-04T08:47:45  <mcstar> its hard to follow indentation through multiple pages
2011-07-04T08:47:49  <antimatroid> provided a whole "block" is double indented, it's fine?
2011-07-04T08:47:58  <antimatroid> i prefer brackets

2011-07-04T08:48:51  <jmcarthur> python does not do the same thing
2011-07-04T08:48:55  <mcstar> i prefer syntax without infix notation
2011-07-04T08:49:04  <jmcarthur> in haskell i can start a block without being forced to do a new line, for example
2011-07-04T08:49:31  <jmcarthur> also, indentation sensitivity is optional in haskell. there's always a way to use semicolons and curly braces instead
2011-07-04T08:49:49  <mcstar> yeah i forgot
2011-07-04T08:49:52  <jmcarthur> although most people just use indentation because it's actually pretty nice
2011-07-04T08:51:51  <jmcarthur> anyway, the thing i don't get about python is the "there's only one way to do it" philosophy. it has led to strange decisions like removing switch statements and stuff
2011-07-04T08:52:26  <jmcarthur> yes, guido, i understand that switch statements in OO smell fishy sometimes, but sometimes they are just the nicest way to write the code you want
2011-07-04T08:53:31  <jmcarthur> also, given that python's motto seems to favor rigidity, i'm not sure why it's dynamically typed at all
2011-07-04T08:53:44  <aerique> I hate all single-paradigm languages with equal passion.
2011-07-04T08:54:05  <jmcarthur> i don't believe in the existence of paradigms
2011-07-04T08:55:08  <mcstar> i believe python is very well suited to many people, those who met it, love it, and forgot to look past it
2011-07-04T08:56:10  <jmcarthur> python was originally designed for teaching beginners how to program, and i think many of its design decisions are okay for that purpose
2011-07-04T08:56:32  <jmcarthur> it's just kind of dumbed down. that's why i don't understand its popularity
2011-07-04T08:56:40  <aerique> but like pascal it got lose in the wild :)
2011-07-04T08:56:50  <antimatroid> python's getting one hell of a bashing with no pythoners here to defend it :P
2011-07-04T08:56:51  <jmcarthur> and by dumbed down, i mean to the point of being less useful
2011-07-04T08:57:10  <jmcarthur> i'm not really trying to attack pythoners
2011-07-04T08:57:13  <jmcarthur> just python :)
2011-07-04T08:58:33  <mcstar> somebody wrote a wrong distance function, and some i remembered it( i dont use that one in my engine) and now it f'ed up my search alg.
2011-07-04T08:58:37  <jmcarthur> i was really just hoping a pythoner could maybe explain why they think these design decisions are worth it, and i wasn't going to argue about it, but i guess i'm the wrong channel at the wrong time
2011-07-04T08:58:37  <mcstar> where was it????

2011-07-04T09:19:06  <mcstar> ahhhh, with this correctly wrapped distance weighted a* behaves quite differently scan-pattern wise
2011-07-04T09:19:33  <mcstar> my testmaps were blocked on the edges, so for them , the non wrapping distance is better

2011-07-04T09:23:15  <mcstar> has a home-grown heuristic
2011-07-04T09:26:29  <mcstar> the previous heuristic in a nother situation:
2011-07-04T09:26:31  <mcstar> http://imgur.com/GcC1G
2011-07-04T09:28:09  <jmcarthur> so the weighting makes the heuristic overestimate the distance sometimes, i'm guessing?
2011-07-04T09:28:44  <aerique> yup
2011-07-04T09:29:05  <antimatroid> another option is to just order stuff my min h
2011-07-04T09:29:09  <jmcarthur> stinky
2011-07-04T09:29:14  <antimatroid> it's faster :P
2011-07-04T09:30:20  <mcstar> ok, since you all are very curious what heuristic im using ill share with you
2011-07-04T09:30:38  <mcstar> g+3*euclidean_d
2011-07-04T09:30:52  <mcstar> it works fabulously on open maps
2011-07-04T09:31:18  <mcstar> on maze maps g+2..10*manhattan_d works better
2011-07-04T09:32:39  <mcstar> so, since the map will look like an open map(sort of) because in the game planned paths will be short, ill be using euclidean distance for heuristics probably
2011-07-04T09:32:58  <antimatroid> why euclidean? :s
2011-07-04T09:34:49  <mcstar> have you seen the images?
2011-07-04T09:35:03  <mcstar> it's very nice as far as im concerned

2011-07-04T09:35:27  <antimatroid> they're not all the same map though yeah?
2011-07-04T09:35:36  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-04T09:35:44  <antimatroid> well, source and target?

2011-07-04T09:36:40  <mcstar> and then from left to right
2011-07-04T09:36:47  <mcstar> you see the green line
2011-07-04T09:36:57  <antimatroid> mcstar: is your euclidean metric wrapped?
2011-07-04T09:37:03  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-04T09:37:14  <mcstar> no
2011-07-04T09:37:15  <antimatroid> are you sure?
2011-07-04T09:37:17  <mcstar> not yet :)
2011-07-04T09:37:31  <mcstar> but for those maps its good this way

2011-07-04T09:37:40  <VilleH> mcstar: In the ants you cant see more than n distance so youll be moving short distances any way

2011-07-04T09:37:57  <antimatroid> VilleH: you can see from other ants

2011-07-04T09:38:17  <antimatroid> and you need to find a path to it
2011-07-04T09:38:42  <antimatroid> or food information out of view

2011-07-04T09:39:40  <mcstar> antimatroid: oh, i forget to tell, but now i see it cause im viewing the function: i take the square root of the euc. distance
2011-07-04T09:39:52  <antimatroid> mcstar: :P
2011-07-04T09:39:58  <antimatroid> VilleH: what do you mean?
2011-07-04T09:40:14  <antimatroid> blocking path finding?
2011-07-04T09:40:19  <antimatroid> i am going to build that in i think
2011-07-04T09:41:00  <VilleH> I mean do you consider other ants as a blocks in path as then you need to calculate routes on every step
2011-07-04T09:41:17  <antimatroid> i still don't understand?
2011-07-04T09:42:04  <antimatroid> i am considering having a set<pair<Location, int> > to indicate when a location is going to be "taken", and using that information while path finding
2011-07-04T09:42:12  <antimatroid> and other information depending on what i'm finding a path for
2011-07-04T09:44:07  <VilleH> When you have n+100 ants, do you calculate paths for each ant on every turn?
2011-07-04T09:45:56  <antimatroid> i do, but i limit how much time i allocate to each thing
2011-07-04T09:46:03  <VilleH> I'm trying to say that for me it seems that the problem isn't the water but other ants that are also moving on your paths
2011-07-04T09:46:56  <mcstar> antimatroid: he means the same thing i was telling you before: do you plan the paths so that ants dont step on each other
2011-07-04T09:47:13  <mcstar> VilleH: i guess its not a problem since he recalculates paths on every turn
2011-07-04T09:47:41  <antimatroid> i am considering doing that anyway
2011-07-04T09:47:46  <VilleH> mcstar: Yeah
2011-07-04T09:48:02  <antimatroid> but even then it'd be tough to recycle paths, i'd need to also check paths aren't going onto newly found water
2011-07-04T09:48:14  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: path finding with multiple units that aren't allowed to pass through each other is very hard
2011-07-04T09:48:30  <mcstar> jmcarthur: he isnt going for the best solution
2011-07-04T09:48:41  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: set<pair<Location, int> > :P
2011-07-04T09:48:58  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: so you mean that you are going to have each ant determine it's path one at a time?
2011-07-04T09:49:03  <jmcarthur> instead of concurrently?
2011-07-04T09:49:04  <antimatroid> yes
2011-07-04T09:49:06  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-07-04T09:49:09  <jmcarthur> that's much easier then
2011-07-04T09:49:14  <jmcarthur> although you might end up with some terrible paths
2011-07-04T09:49:34  <antimatroid> like when collecting food, i will collect a food item, then consider the moving ants new location and time available, as well as the new ant when that's available to collect the rest of the food
2011-07-04T09:49:45  <antimatroid> how will that get terrible paths?
2011-07-04T09:49:52  <jmcarthur> also, it still means you have to so your A* in a 3d space instead of a 2D space
2011-07-04T09:49:55  <jmcarthur> *to do
2011-07-04T09:50:02  <antimatroid> why?
2011-07-04T09:50:15  <jmcarthur> each position is now indexed by time, as well
2011-07-04T09:50:52  <jmcarthur> it also gives you another "direction" to move: stay still
2011-07-04T09:50:59  <antimatroid> yeah

2011-07-04T09:51:15  <antimatroid> i don't think that will be too painful though
2011-07-04T09:51:22  <VilleH> :D
2011-07-04T09:51:22  <jmcarthur> it will make it slower though
2011-07-04T09:51:29  <antimatroid> you just work out "stand still" moves while bracktracking your path
2011-07-04T09:51:41  <jmcarthur> no that's not what i mean
2011-07-04T09:52:00  <jmcarthur> i mean those are actual nodes in the algorithm
2011-07-04T09:52:35  <antimatroid> yeah, but say you come across a node that is taken with the g you have for it, then you just find the next highest g that it isn't taken then add that information to the search queue?
2011-07-04T09:52:38  <jmcarthur> if you extrude the map by time and include other ants' paths in it then you have essentially a 3d map, and "standing still" is the same as simply "going forward in time without moving"
2011-07-04T09:53:21  <jmcarthur> it's a 3D map where all moves or non-moves go in the same direction along one of the axes (time)
2011-07-04T09:53:23  <VilleH> Was it some ubuntu box currently running beta server? I could grab computer with me and put up own server to try to fix that annoying c# test bug..
2011-07-04T09:53:29  <mcstar> jmcarthur: his solution in 3d is more like a branching tree
2011-07-04T09:54:01  <mcstar> in time, it leaves behind leafes, and starts on another paths
2011-07-04T09:54:09  <mcstar> sorry, lefes->branches
2011-07-04T09:54:21  <jmcarthur> is that actually more efficient?
2011-07-04T09:55:13  <mcstar> i dont think its very efficient at all, but the wants to do it this way
2011-07-04T09:55:27  <antimatroid> :)
2011-07-04T09:55:29  <mcstar> i mean its a lot of wasted effort

2011-07-04T09:55:59  <antimatroid> how would you guys do it?
2011-07-04T09:56:01  <jmcarthur> IMO, if you already have A*, might as well just apply it to a more complicated map instead of complicating the algorithm itself
2011-07-04T09:56:27  <jmcarthur> i would literally do the 3D map version i was talking about
2011-07-04T09:56:28  <mcstar> antimatroid: i'd let antimatroid figure out a better solution, and then id make him tell me
2011-07-04T09:57:10  <jmcarthur> it would probably be lazily generated though, since i won't necessarily care about all time-space in the game
2011-07-04T09:57:42  <mcstar> i kind of make multiple tiers of the map, a node could have different g values with different parents, every node could be a stack of those
2011-07-04T10:02:33  <mcstar> no reactions? yeah, i should consider it myself not just spit it out into the open to let someone else analyze it

2011-07-04T11:51:23  <antimatroid> or that there was an "equivalent" alternative

2011-07-04T12:08:27  <antimatroid> i think it's a matter of it updating the g value after it's already been searched, and that not "proagating" through
2011-07-04T12:08:38  <jmcarthur> is there a way to download bot inputs from a replay?
2011-07-04T12:08:52  <antimatroid> not sure
2011-07-04T12:09:02  <mcstar> when you get the nbors of an open cell, you have to check to see if any of them is in the open set, if it is, then see, if the g value would be lower if you came from here, then from its current parent
2011-07-04T12:09:14  <mcstar> if so, update it and its parents too
2011-07-04T12:10:00  <mcstar> not its parents, but the variables, representing its parents' coordinates
2011-07-04T12:11:04  <mcstar> aham

2011-07-04T12:11:55  <mcstar> ? you have to store it
2011-07-04T12:12:07  <antimatroid> how else would i have it?
2011-07-04T12:12:40  <mcstar> so, where do you store the "closed" nodes, that you put away?
2011-07-04T12:12:58  <mcstar> the brown ones
2011-07-04T12:12:58  <jmcarthur> i think antimatroid is destructively mutating the nodes to say he has visited them

2011-07-04T12:14:59  <antimatroid> but you're right, that's better
2011-07-04T12:15:15  <antimatroid> i did the path back track as an afterthought for debugging
2011-07-04T12:15:25  <antimatroid> like i said, it's all a big mess :P
2011-07-04T12:15:38  <mcstar> aham, so you leave every node in the priority queue
2011-07-04T12:16:03  <mcstar> but still, it  must have information of its parents, i mean how else would you backtrack?
2011-07-04T12:16:20  <mcstar> this is what i dont understand
2011-07-04T12:16:37  <mcstar> if you didnt store the parents, what guides you?
2011-07-04T12:19:09  <mcstar> ok i got it
2011-07-04T12:19:29  <mcstar> so you simply search backwards, always choosing the node with the smaller g value
2011-07-04T12:19:37  <antimatroid> yep
2011-07-04T12:19:58  <mcstar> but, since you left duplicate elements in the queue, this scheme will collapse
2011-07-04T12:20:07  <antimatroid> why?
2011-07-04T12:20:26  <antimatroid> i just clear my queue once i find a target
2011-07-04T12:20:26  <mcstar> because 1 node will appear twice, for example, with different g values
2011-07-04T12:20:45  <antimatroid> no, i have a single matrix of g values, containing the smallest one i find for each location
2011-07-04T12:20:54  <mcstar> aham
2011-07-04T12:20:58  <antimatroid> i use that to extract the path
2011-07-04T12:21:20  <mcstar> actually this should work

2011-07-04T12:34:41  <jmcarthur> i am now making a significantly less complex starter, with fewer library dependencies
2011-07-04T12:35:08  <jmcarthur> still has a couple though :\
2011-07-04T12:36:53  <McLeopold> @later tell sir_macelon is your bot deterministic?
2011-07-04T12:36:53  <contestbot> McLeopold: OK
2011-07-04T12:37:09  * antimatroid thinks we need a later ask
2011-07-04T12:37:24  <McLeopold> @later tell _flag is your bot deterministic?
2011-07-04T12:37:24  <contestbot> McLeopold: Yes master!
2011-07-04T12:38:03  <antimatroid> mcleopold: deterministic irrelevant of starting position?
2011-07-04T12:38:07  <antimatroid> that is hard to achieve
2011-07-04T12:38:29  <McLeopold> I want to replay this game with a different cutoff setting http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/game/58696
2011-07-04T12:38:33  <jmcarthur> a function of starting position is still deterministic
2011-07-04T12:38:44  <McLeopold> sir_macelon was questioning if it was cutoff too early
2011-07-04T12:39:12  <McLeopold> right now if you can old 66% of the population(including food) for 150 turns, it will stop the game
2011-07-04T12:39:18  <McLeopold> so far only one complaint
2011-07-04T12:39:35  <McLeopold> I haven't seen evidence of games going the wrong way yet
2011-07-04T12:41:17  <jmcarthur> maybe it would also be good to look for a trend in a sliding window or something before cutting the game short
2011-07-04T12:41:27  <jmcarthur> starts to get complicated though
2011-07-04T12:41:43  <jmcarthur> makes it harder for bots to estimate the end of the game
2011-07-04T12:42:16  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: if you have verbose turned on in the latest playgame, you can see the logic of the cutoff
2011-07-04T12:42:36  <McLeopold> it displays the current bot with 66% or move, and counts the turns
2011-07-04T12:42:43  <McLeopold> /move/more/
2011-07-04T12:43:38  <McLeopold> also, with the cutoff logic, if there is 66% percent of food for 150 turns, the game gets stopped, this shortens games of bots that suck and can't find food
2011-07-04T12:43:46  <McLeopold> That's probably the biggest payoff
2011-07-04T12:43:57  <McLeopold> in games per minute, that is

2011-07-04T12:47:56  <mcstar> ok :)
2011-07-04T12:48:15  <mcstar> hey i noticed that from going either direction my alg. scans more squares than yours
2011-07-04T12:48:25  <mcstar> at least 2x much
2011-07-04T12:48:31  <mcstar> more not much
2011-07-04T12:48:51  <pcavs> So what's the current situation with Java bots? I read something along the lines of how the sandboxing really hinders performance, is that still accurate?
2011-07-04T12:48:55  <antimatroid> which image of mine are you going off?
2011-07-04T12:48:58  <mcstar> so, maybe the problem isnt with backtracking, i think that scheme should work
2011-07-04T12:49:08  <mcstar> http://ants.zeroviz.us/u2Fhj/
2011-07-04T12:49:14  <mcstar> the sub-suboptimal one
2011-07-04T12:49:29  <antimatroid> that's when i order my search queue based off min h
2011-07-04T12:49:33  <antimatroid> no minimising f at all
2011-07-04T12:49:37  <mcstar> aaaa
2011-07-04T12:49:44  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-04T12:49:55  <mcstar> so when you do, whats the problem then?
2011-07-04T12:50:00  <antimatroid> i do notice a smaller number of searched squares off min f then min h on a draw though
2011-07-04T12:50:20  <antimatroid> mcstar: my problem is that there is a better suboptimal path through the "Searched squares"
2011-07-04T12:50:31  <antimatroid> i have a feeling weighted a* is going to have hte same problem
2011-07-04T12:50:40  <antimatroid> and i don't think your backtrack method is going to be any better
2011-07-04T12:50:59  <mcstar> so when you use the normal a*, is there a problem or not?
2011-07-04T12:51:03  <antimatroid> no problem
2011-07-04T12:51:11  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-04T12:51:19  <antimatroid> try yours with normal a*, min f then min h, and min h
2011-07-04T12:51:25  <mcstar> is the path 76 long?
2011-07-04T12:51:32  <antimatroid> 77
2011-07-04T12:51:38  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-04T12:51:41  <antimatroid> i could have overestimated it though
2011-07-04T12:51:42  <antimatroid> so yeah
2011-07-04T12:51:56  <mcstar> 76 between targets :)
2011-07-04T12:52:30  <mcstar> than all is right, i thought there was a bigger problem
2011-07-04T12:52:44  <antimatroid> mcstar: http://ants.zeroviz.us/CgHBE/ i get that when i search with min f then min h
2011-07-04T12:53:04  <antimatroid> it's better than just plain min f

2011-07-04T14:07:22  <VilleH> what language are you using?

2011-07-04T14:07:34  <jmcarthur> i even got the server to show that by writing the wrapper in haskell

2011-07-04T14:14:36  <mcstar> srsly
2011-07-04T14:15:11  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-07-04T14:15:34  <jmcarthur> actually i guess that's not a bad idea. we are dealing with small enough numbers that a tiny lookup table is probably sufficient
2011-07-04T14:16:59  <jmcarthur> at first i just was wondering how you would improve over the standard sqrt function
2011-07-04T14:17:02  <mcstar> id use a small iteration
2011-07-04T14:17:15  <mcstar> well, i dont need full precision
2011-07-04T14:17:20  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-07-04T14:17:47  <jmcarthur> actually, why do you need to compute it at all?
2011-07-04T14:18:27  <mcstar> i like the way my a* works with euclidean heuristics
2011-07-04T14:18:37  <mcstar> and i need to take the sqrt
2011-07-04T14:19:19  <mcstar> it seems that my alg. faster than the call to sqrt

2011-07-04T14:23:24  <VilleH> For how big numbers you need the sqrt?
2011-07-04T14:24:01  <jmcarthur> that is larger than i would do with a lookup table, yes, so the iterative version is probably fine, especially if you don't care as much about precision and you can cut the iterations down
2011-07-04T14:25:38  <jmcarthur> in fact, i bet you could even get pretty fancy if you felt like doing through the trouble... perform the heuristic for each neighbor in lock step and short cut the evaluation as soon as you are sure enough about which one is most optimal
2011-07-04T14:25:47  <mcstar> (reduce (lambda (sofar s) (* 0.5 (+ sofar (/ s sofar)))) (make-list 8 :initial-element 1000))

2011-07-04T14:32:41  <jmcarthur> if it does it isn't named reduce
2011-07-04T14:32:51  <jmcarthur> is reduce a kind of fold?

2011-07-04T14:33:47  <jmcarthur> no initial value?
2011-07-04T14:33:50  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-07-04T14:33:56  <jmcarthur> that's foldl in haskell
2011-07-04T14:35:16  <jmcarthur> i'm guessing the result of that make-list expression would be  (1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000)  ?

2011-07-04T14:42:53  <jmcarthur> foldl expects a function and an initial value
2011-07-04T14:42:56  <jmcarthur> along with the list

2011-07-04T14:44:24  <jmcarthur> does reduce just use the first element of the list as the initial value?
2011-07-04T14:44:47  <jmcarthur> if so then the correct translation would use foldl1'

2011-07-04T14:48:16  <mcstar> i hate this
2011-07-04T14:48:17  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-07-04T14:48:23  <mcstar> wrong buffer
2011-07-04T14:48:24  <jmcarthur>  iterate (\n -> (*0.5) . (+n) . (/n) $ 1000) 1000 !! 8
2011-07-04T14:48:26  <jmcarthur> ^^ another version
2011-07-04T14:48:57  <mcstar> (defun sqrt-iter (val &key (iter 10))
2011-07-04T14:48:59  <mcstar>    (labels ((aux (sq times)

2011-07-04T14:49:07  <mcstar>      (aux val 0)))now thats it, the cl version
2011-07-04T14:49:31  <jmcarthur> iterate (\n -> (1000 / n + n) / 2) 1000 !! 8
2011-07-04T14:50:02  <mcstar> and is it fast?
2011-07-04T14:50:04  <jmcarthur> "<mcstar> ok, speed wise ill have to drop reduce obviously"  <-- why?
2011-07-04T14:50:20  <jmcarthur> yeah, in haskell that code should be pretty optimal, actually
2011-07-04T14:50:35  <jmcarthur> i could compile and check the core it generates if you'd like
2011-07-04T14:50:38  <mcstar> can you put it in a timer?
2011-07-04T14:50:46  <jmcarthur> or i could bench it, sure
2011-07-04T14:51:03  <mcstar> of course run it like a million times
2011-07-04T14:51:09  <jmcarthur> i'll use criterion
2011-07-04T14:52:18  <jmcarthur> okay, so i should stick with 8 iterations counting the initial value then?
2011-07-04T14:52:56  <mcstar> thats ok
2011-07-04T14:53:11  <jmcarthur> dang i didn't have criterion installed
2011-07-04T14:53:25  <jmcarthur> pardon me while i want for it to build

2011-07-04T14:58:18  <jmcarthur> should be acceptable though
2011-07-04T14:58:26  <jmcarthur> i'll compare it to the sqrt primop, too

2011-07-04T15:05:53  <mcstar> no
2011-07-04T15:05:53  <jmcarthur> haha
2011-07-04T15:05:57  <jmcarthur> actually i did
2011-07-04T15:06:04  <mcstar> really?
2011-07-04T15:06:16  <mcstar> ah, ok the inner blocks
2011-07-04T15:06:34  <jmcarthur> yeah the primop is much much faster
2011-07-04T15:06:58  <jmcarthur> 16.9ns instead of 301.6ns
2011-07-04T15:07:04  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-04T15:07:07  <mcstar> much better
2011-07-04T15:07:11  <jmcarthur> but let me check the core and make sure this compiled well
2011-07-04T15:07:14  <mcstar> i have similar results with cl

2011-07-04T15:10:55  <jmcarthur> i didn't realize that (!!) wouldn't fuse :\
2011-07-04T15:11:02  <stocha> jmcarthur: i totally agree with you about food spawn speed needing to be settled into stone somehow.
2011-07-04T15:12:18  <jmcarthur> mcstar: see the annotation: http://hpaste.org/48723
2011-07-04T15:12:19  <stocha> jmcarthur: because otherwise we simply can't design a good food collection (impossible to anticipate spawning)
2011-07-04T15:12:25  <jmcarthur> stocha: yeah
2011-07-04T15:12:41  <jmcarthur> mcstar: so the fold version goes about twice as fast as the iterate/!! version
2011-07-04T15:12:49  <jmcarthur> disappointing
2011-07-04T15:12:57  <jmcarthur> but the core for the fold is optimal at least
2011-07-04T15:13:35  <stocha> jmcarthur: i also totally agree about anything that affect the game or winning strategy should be speced.
2011-07-04T15:13:36  <jmcarthur> it's a tight, unboxed, recursive loop
2011-07-04T15:14:36  <jmcarthur> wtf, actually it's only unboxed on the accumulator
2011-07-04T15:14:38  <jmcarthur> grr
2011-07-04T15:14:39  <mcstar> ok, 1/30 speed
2011-07-04T15:14:44  <jmcarthur> that's i'm, i'm breaking out stream fusion
2011-07-04T15:14:47  <mcstar> thats not very bad
2011-07-04T15:15:09  <mcstar> stream fusion wtf are you talking about?
2011-07-04T15:15:14  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-04T15:15:18  <mcstar> noobie alert
2011-07-04T15:16:57  <jmcarthur> it's the big guns when it comes to fusion these days
2011-07-04T15:18:10  <mcstar> mine is like 1/60 of the speed of the original
2011-07-04T15:18:43  <jmcarthur> this one is down to 118ns
2011-07-04T15:19:15  <jmcarthur> so about 1/8 or 1/7 the speed of the original
2011-07-04T15:19:21  <mcstar> though the built in is using 2.58 ns
2011-07-04T15:19:46  <jmcarthur> that's pretty good compared to ghc's builtin
2011-07-04T15:19:56  <mcstar> yeah
2011-07-04T15:20:00  <jmcarthur> like i said, ghc is pretty bad at floating point :(
2011-07-04T15:20:02  <mcstar> but maybe you are on a phone
2011-07-04T15:20:16  <jmcarthur> it's the code generator, mainly
2011-07-04T15:20:16  <mcstar> kidding
2011-07-04T15:20:23  <jmcarthur> hmm, i'll the a different back end
2011-07-04T15:20:29  <mcstar> hey, they say lisp is bad for floating point
2011-07-04T15:20:46  <mcstar> but im not gonna code this up in c
2011-07-04T15:20:56  <mcstar> or will i?
2011-07-04T15:20:58  <jmcarthur> *try
2011-07-04T15:21:19  <jmcarthur> if i need speed badly enough i just write a little C for the main loop and bind to it from haskell
2011-07-04T15:21:33  <stocha> antimatroid: i'm very sorry that the main team doesn't even want to beta tests the maps. I would like maps to be part of the specification. Because they are the main rule.
2011-07-04T15:21:39  <mcstar> cl has cffi, i could do that too
2011-07-04T15:21:48  <mcstar> but the contest doesnt allow this
2011-07-04T15:22:04  <jmcarthur> it's not against the rules if you can make it work
2011-07-04T15:22:21  <mcstar> it could be easier
2011-07-04T15:22:38  <jmcarthur> dang, the llvm backend isn't working for some reason
2011-07-04T15:22:49  <mcstar> i dont understand why cant they make a compiler-extension for makefiles
2011-07-04T15:23:00  <mcstar> or is there one?
2011-07-04T15:23:10  <mcstar> can the compile script run scripts?

2011-07-04T15:26:30  <jmcarthur> i think it's just that arch has a bleeding edge llvm installed
2011-07-04T15:26:50  <jmcarthur> apparently ghc HEAD accounts for it now. i should get a copy of HEAD anyway
2011-07-04T15:26:54  <mcstar> look for an older one in the aur
2011-07-04T15:27:14  <mcstar> wth is llvm anyway?

2011-07-04T15:53:38  <mcstar> is it tail-recursive, or is it a loop of some kind?

2011-07-04T15:55:38  <jmcarthur> c compilers suck at recursion

2011-07-04T16:11:53  <mcstar> is it a virtual machine for haskell code?
2011-07-04T16:18:23  <jmreardon> for haskell I believe it just acts as an optimization phase for the compiler, it's supposed to be quite good
2011-07-04T16:18:47  <jmreardon> (in general, can't speak for how well it works with ghc)
2011-07-04T16:23:46  <jmcarthur> it's for many languages
2011-07-04T16:24:17  <jmcarthur> it can compile to machine code or to bytecode with a JIT interpreter
2011-07-04T16:24:25  <jmcarthur> in the case of ghc specifically it's only used to compile to machine code

2011-07-04T21:21:24  <amstan> jbrechtel: you potentially could, but it's not supported
2011-07-04T21:22:38  <jbrechtel> amstan: Ok, cool.  It's not against the rules though, just potentially not supported.
2011-07-04T21:23:09  <jbrechtel> With that in mind, is there any real reason I need to send my source?  Is it just because the compiler step would fail otherwise with no source files to compile?
2011-07-04T21:23:23  <amstan> as fas as i know, the only way to include precompiled things and then get the contest to execute them is python/ctypes
2011-07-04T21:23:24  <jbrechtel> s/potentially not supported/potentially won't work/
2011-07-04T21:24:02  <amstan> if the compiler step fails it won't let the bot in
2011-07-04T21:24:37  <jbrechtel> It *looks like* the Scala compiler code tries to support included jars.  Though the Scala compiler code seems to be broken anyways.

2011-07-04T23:10:30  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: why are you calculating square roots anyway?
2011-07-04T23:10:40  <antimatroid> if it's for the euclidean metric, just square it and all distances are integers
2011-07-04T23:14:11  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: that was mcstar, not me
2011-07-04T23:14:38  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: we got sidetracked by various ways to write sqrt
2011-07-04T23:15:06  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: but anyway, mcstar is using it for something in his heuristic for A* and says he can't get rid of it, so...
2011-07-04T23:15:12  <jmcarthur> i asked the same question
2011-07-04T23:15:34  <antimatroid> i don't understand why he can't get rid of it, but i'll ask him ;)
2011-07-04T23:26:29  <jmcarthur> amstan: that's not the only way. my current submission is a binary
2011-07-04T23:26:52  <jmcarthur> amstan: i just wrote a wrapper program to exec the binary. the server just compiles the wrapper and calls it a success
2011-07-04T23:27:19  <jmcarthur> oh, *libraries*
2011-07-04T23:27:28  <jmcarthur> well, that's possible outside of python, too
2011-07-04T23:28:10  <jmcarthur> so long as you can sneak it into the linking stage of your build system. tough to do with gcc, but not necessarily the case with other compilers

2011-07-04T23:32:03  <jmcarthur> the llvm backend helped a little across the board in my sqrt benchmarks, but didn't fundamentally change anything
