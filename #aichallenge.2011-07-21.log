2011-07-21T11:44:15  <sir_macelon> hi
2011-07-21T11:44:51  <sir_macelon> how come there's no food at start in this game? http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=99254
2011-07-21T11:45:19  <sir_macelon> i thought there's a guaranteed amount of food at start
2011-07-21T11:46:10  <sir_macelon> the game turned out to be who get luckiest to get close to food spawns
2011-07-21T11:46:48  *** ibdknox <ibdknox!~ibdknox@c-98-210-156-61.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-21T11:50:49  <eashoka> sir_macelon : good point!
2011-07-21T11:53:25  <sir_macelon> i saw also games where a very low food spawn rate lead to random/lucky results depending where you sent your ants for exploring
2011-07-21T11:54:18  <eashoka> sir_macelon : however, that can happen even in positions starting with food isn't it ? I think what needs to be done is to make sure food spawns are symmetrical(no food at all is symmatrical too :-)) at the start and then they should appear in entirely random spots.
2011-07-21T11:55:42  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I think it is already spawn symmetrically, depending on map symmetry
2011-07-21T11:55:57  <eashoka> sir_macelon : I too agree, low food spawn cases are definite lotteries. I may be mistaken, but I noticed in some maps there were high pobability for food to appear in certain places than others. this will favour certain bots which are programmed to give preference to certain directions over others.
2011-07-21T11:56:35  <eashoka> for instance, some of octagonal maps had a very high probability of food to appear in the center
2011-07-21T11:57:49  <sir_macelon> eashoka: that's because of their type of symmetry unfortunately
2011-07-21T11:58:04  <sir_macelon> eashoka: but i guess they were removed anyway
2011-07-21T11:59:46  <sir_macelon> eashoka: you've won here with me thanks to this move: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=99382&turn=55&row=46&col=33 :)
2011-07-21T12:01:25  <eashoka> aha! you analyze things in detail!
2011-07-21T12:01:40  <eashoka> tell me the turn number please.
2011-07-21T12:02:24  <eashoka> yeah I too saw that game. one of very few instances I managed to beat you.
2011-07-21T12:02:31  <eashoka> ah turn 55... let me see
2011-07-21T12:08:31  <eashoka> sir_macelon :further adding to your point, appearance of a large amount of food in one spot suddenly also can lead to lucky results. that too I have seen in some maps.
2011-07-21T12:10:46  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I always try to find the cause of my failure and see whether this was just luck or my bot has done something wrong
2011-07-21T12:11:53  <sir_macelon> eashoka: if you rewind that game, then you'll see that food hasn't appeared there in one turn
2011-07-21T12:12:43  <sir_macelon> eashoka: mcleopold has fixed already the issue with groups of food being spawn
2011-07-21T12:15:13  <eashoka> in that particular case (turn 55) I think I just got lucky the spawns were closer to me and made the natural and obvious move. your bot couldn't have done better there isn't it?uld you have

2011-07-21T12:23:33  <sir_macelon> eashoka: well i did expect that come anyway, I've just reached a level where it's hard to improve significantly and for others implementing battle tactics gives a big boost

2011-07-21T17:14:14  <janzert> it was the motivation for doing this :)
2011-07-21T17:20:08  <janzert> also I think all of this should be recorded in the game replay file (although I'm not completely sure that it isn't)

2011-07-21T19:13:20  <_flag> I'm not sure if this is intentional, but I'd just like to point out how low the per-turn food spawning rate is in this game: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=100140
2011-07-21T19:15:28  <_flag> Even after the maximum 1500 turns the game is clearly not resolved and the winner is decided based on a small number of early food spawns
2011-07-21T19:17:58  <mleise> _flag: You are only angry because you came in 2nd :p
2011-07-21T19:56:22  *** antimatroid <antimatroid!~nick@104.198.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-21T20:05:44  <_flag> mleise: That's part of it, but the point is that the low food rate encourages bots to avoid each other, occupy space and simply wait for food spawns. I'm pretty sure had the game gone on another few thousand turns I probably would've won, but games shouldn't have to be that long in order to be decided
2011-07-21T20:06:30  <mleise> Absolutly right. I agree with you.
2011-07-21T20:06:39  <janzert> some are pushing for all games to have a really low spawn rate like that
2011-07-21T20:07:00  <_flag> janzert: Then all you'll get is games decided by lucky food spawns and nobody ever attacking
2011-07-21T20:07:04  <janzert> personally I agree that it just lengthens the time to a natural resolution of the game
2011-07-21T20:07:57  <_flag> Personally I'd like to have a higher rate of food spawns as to encourage battle tactics and minimize the impact of random luck
2011-07-21T20:08:09  <_flag> However, that might leave people not using C/C++ at a disadvantage

2011-07-21T20:09:32  <janzert> I think the rate should be as fast as possible while still allowing good bots to get their ants into their optimal or preferred positions
2011-07-21T20:10:26  <janzert> i.e. there are problems with too slow or too fast of a rate
2011-07-21T20:15:57  <bhasker> i think food rate should be high
2011-07-21T20:16:02  <bhasker> low spaw rate is just boring as hell
2011-07-21T20:16:06  <bhasker> to watch too

2011-07-21T20:55:52  <amstan> pgpaskar_: oh.. you mean that you did the same thing?
2011-07-21T20:55:57  <amstan> nah.. that's fine
2011-07-21T20:56:16  <pgpaskar_> lol
2011-07-21T20:56:25  <pgpaskar_> At some point I enabled a labs extension that made the hotkey use reply all
2011-07-21T20:56:43  <amstan> reply all is best in most cases
2011-07-21T20:56:45  <amstan> except this one
2011-07-21T20:56:48  <pgpaskar_> this was not an issue since I rarely encounter such ... a situation
2011-07-21T20:56:50  <amstan> but that's fine..
2011-07-21T20:56:59  <amstan> idk, i don't hate for this
2011-07-21T20:57:16  <pgpaskar_> I'm kinda annoyed that Id id it though because people whose spam filters caught the original
2011-07-21T20:57:20  <pgpaskar_> now probably have my copy...
2011-07-21T20:57:25  <pgpaskar_> :(
2011-07-21T20:57:27  <amstan> pgpaskar_: but you're right.. if they were bccing everyone they would have got more replies
2011-07-21T20:57:48  <amstan> because they make you think you're special
2011-07-21T20:58:00  <pgpaskar_> It's not even that
2011-07-21T20:58:04  <pgpaskar_> if you have ana ctual priate mailing list
2011-07-21T20:58:10  <pgpaskar_> and you do that like Google did a few weeks ago
2011-07-21T20:58:13  <pgpaskar_> you leak everyone's email
2011-07-21T20:58:21  <pgpaskar_> You just need one person with malware on their computer
2011-07-21T20:58:28  <amstan> yep
2011-07-21T20:58:30  <amstan> and spam
2011-07-21T20:58:31  <pgpaskar_> And those emails are now circulated..
2011-07-21T20:58:55  <pgpaskar_> I kinda regret doing it now.  luckily it was from my uwaterloo account so only my school reputationis tarnished! :P
2011-07-21T20:59:11  <pgpaskar_> whoa this is the ai contst channel, hows this going LOL
