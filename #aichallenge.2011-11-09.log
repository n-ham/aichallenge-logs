When I upload my source code to the server, do I just have to provide the relevant library files, or is there something more complex that's necessary?

2011-11-09T03:30:39  <delt0r_> So i do this too. But i use a BufferedReader (java)

2011-11-09T03:31:02  <Garf> Java might make different promises regarding stdio buffering
2011-11-09T03:31:07  <delt0r_> while that seems to assume you will always get complete lines
2011-11-09T03:31:09  <Garf> with a C or C++ bot this isn't an issue
2011-11-09T03:31:15  <Garf> because stdio is line buffered by default (IIRC)
2011-11-09T03:31:20  <delt0r_> yea
2011-11-09T03:31:29  <delt0r_> on every OS i have used at least
2011-11-09T03:31:36  <Garf> node.js doesn't
2011-11-09T03:31:41  <delt0r_> odd
2011-11-09T03:31:59  <Garf> as far as I can tell, they broke it even further in 0.6.x
2011-11-09T03:32:52  <Garf> because they removed buffering control in favor of "guessing" that you want no buffering in a TTY but you do want it in a pipe
2011-11-09T03:33:08  <Garf> anyway, no point in rating about that
2011-11-09T03:33:11  * Garf fixes the bots

2011-11-09T04:09:12  <delt0r_> one trick is to do your init over say the first 5 turns
2011-11-09T04:09:31  <grom358> its just sometimes on first turn it timeouts
2011-11-09T04:09:56  <grom358> I actually put a bunch of init in setup function
2011-11-09T04:10:00  <delt0r_> i have not noticed any problems personally... but then my bot in not server side yet
2011-11-09T04:10:07  <grom358> doesn't the bot get more time for loading
2011-11-09T04:10:11  <delt0r_> yes
2011-11-09T04:10:17  <pairofdice> loadtime is 3000ms
2011-11-09T04:10:26  <pairofdice> Should be plenty

2011-11-09T04:10:34  <delt0r_> indeed
2011-11-09T04:10:45  <delt0r_> what about if the server is loaded?
2011-11-09T04:10:52  <grom358> idk.. it only happens on the odd occasion
2011-11-09T04:10:56  <delt0r_> or trashing... this may affect java bots first
2011-11-09T04:11:29  <delt0r_> since the virtual stuff does not like the way java uses lots of mapped memory and stuff

2011-11-09T04:20:00  <delt0r_> then someone deciends to put it into the offical comp
2011-11-09T04:20:00  <grom358> just sucks that randomly my bot flakes out.. when normally its fast as

2011-11-09T04:20:32  <Zao> It's easy to make things fast if they don't have to be correct :D
2011-11-09T04:20:32  <delt0r_> well virtulaizaion in our tests cost you a factor of 2 right off the bat
2011-11-09T04:20:46  <delt0r_> our here is me at work
2011-11-09T04:20:58  <delt0r_> then its openjdk
2011-11-09T04:21:17  <delt0r_> rather than the sun jdk 7 with tiered jit compilation
2011-11-09T04:21:21  * Zao slips in a "write once, debug everywhere"
2011-11-09T04:21:39  <grom358> lol.. well its too late to rewrite in C++
2011-11-09T04:21:47  <delt0r_> so that makes the warm up a little worse but throughput is a little higher
2011-11-09T04:22:09  <delt0r_> Zao is just being cheeky, or  a smart mouth
2011-11-09T04:22:21  <delt0r_> there really is nothing wrong with java.
2011-11-09T04:22:44  <delt0r_> just need to realize that this is *not* real time programing and the servers you run are different
2011-11-09T04:23:15  <grom358> yeah.. but I seriously don't see how I can work around this warmup problem
2011-11-09T04:23:16  <delt0r_> its not like C/C++ would also have different performance on different setups now is it?
2011-11-09T04:23:33  <delt0r_> I seriously doubt you have a big warm up problem
2011-11-09T04:23:34  <Garf> the issue here is that java has performance impacts you can't control
2011-11-09T04:23:47  <Garf> its one advantage of GC. in a situation like here, it can hit you hard
2011-11-09T04:23:58  <Garf> disadvantage of course
2011-11-09T04:24:02  <delt0r_> I think you have some large map issues... that second link with the smaller map... you didn't timeout
2011-11-09T04:24:05  <Garf> and JIT+GC rather than just GC
2011-11-09T04:24:24  <delt0r_> Garf: true java is *not* "real time"
2011-11-09T04:24:27  <grom358> but I don't timeout on 10 player maps either most of the time, http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=74783&user=4130

2011-11-09T04:24:33  <delt0r_> but then you just need to work with your tools
2011-11-09T04:24:51  <Garf> delt0r: unfortunately, in this challenge you can't control your JVM
2011-11-09T04:24:52  <delt0r_> java is a tool like C/C++/Lisp/Go/Okk!
2011-11-09T04:25:05  <Garf> I'd love to give a "--crankshaft" flag to the node.js runtime :P
2011-11-09T04:25:05  <delt0r_> Garf: that is a general problem
2011-11-09T04:25:16  <grom358> I play on plenty of big maps fine
2011-11-09T04:25:19  <delt0r_> not just for java... we can't control our hardware
2011-11-09T04:25:25  <Garf> not hardware
2011-11-09T04:25:26  <Garf> software
2011-11-09T04:25:31  <delt0r_> however we *know* the target JVM
2011-11-09T04:25:32  <Garf> your VM runtime

2011-11-09T04:25:37  <Garf> is not something you can reconfigure
2011-11-09T04:25:37  <delt0r_> so work with that target
2011-11-09T04:25:56  <delt0r_> Pretty standard
2011-11-09T04:26:16  <Garf> depending on what it guarantees exactly, you can be pretty SOL if you have to guarantee small GC pauses
2011-11-09T04:26:25  <Garf> though I agree in practise it should be manageable
2011-11-09T04:26:26  <delt0r_> grom358: yes, but not all the time... see green tea when there is a lot of ants... he times out
2011-11-09T04:26:50  <delt0r_> 500ms is a eternity
2011-11-09T04:27:10  <delt0r_> my Java games have no problems keeping smooth animations at 60fps
2011-11-09T04:27:36  <delt0r_> grom358: Also you can do stuff incrementally at the start
2011-11-09T04:27:37  <grom358> yeah I use Java for animations and what not.. never had problem with FPS either
2011-11-09T04:27:49  <delt0r_> since you don't need something that smart at the start
2011-11-09T04:27:56  <delt0r_> then everything is warmed up
2011-11-09T04:28:13  <grom358> the thing is though.. like I said.. I added a bunch of  ants.getTimeRemaining() checks in
2011-11-09T04:28:17  <delt0r_> still use the same code, but break out of loops early at the start
2011-11-09T04:28:30  <grom358> so I bail out of the turn if happen to be running out of time

2011-11-09T04:29:04  <grom358> I think it uses current millisecond one
2011-11-09T04:29:15  <delt0r_> you need to be a little more adaptive.... as we can see with time outs. its clearly not getting the job done
2011-11-09T04:29:23  <delt0r_> Both are expensive
2011-11-09T04:29:32  <delt0r_> ms or more... IIRC

2011-11-09T04:29:49  <delt0r_> no not that bad
2011-11-09T04:29:58  <delt0r_> but 1 ms is a really really slow
2011-11-09T04:30:00  <grom358> yeah I'm bailing out early as
2011-11-09T04:31:04  <grom358> its like it timeouts out before it even gets to doTurn
2011-11-09T04:31:27  <delt0r_> what about that first 3 seconds you do your first turn 2-4 times if you have the time... get the JIT to compile your stuff in the warm up time
2011-11-09T04:31:33  <grom358> I do allocate a lot of Set<Tile> structures
2011-11-09T04:31:40  <delt0r_> thinking out loud here btw
2011-11-09T04:32:11  <delt0r_> grom358: that could cause a stall.... but it shouldn't ... allocation is fast with GC.

2011-11-09T04:35:50  <grom358> yeah just added some logging with loading my bot on 5 player map.. and most of the time I take 60ms for my turn
2011-11-09T04:35:55  <delt0r_> just not bleading edge
2011-11-09T04:36:33  <delt0r_> grom358: have you tried getting the bot input of the maps that you do timeout on and seeing what happens?
2011-11-09T04:36:42  <Blkt> good morning everyone
2011-11-09T04:37:17  <delt0r_> grom358: its the BOT IN icon on the bottom right of the replay
2011-11-09T04:37:20  <grom358> what is weird though.. when I load my bot as the player multiple times.. only some of them timeout
2011-11-09T04:38:08  <grom358> I thinking its cause I only have dual core
2011-11-09T04:38:21  <delt0r_> ??
2011-11-09T04:38:31  <delt0r_> on the servers i think you only get a "single core
2011-11-09T04:38:41  <delt0r_> dual core makes java more responsive
2011-11-09T04:38:50  <grom358> yeah.. but locally I trying to ran my bot 4 times with only dual core CPU
2011-11-09T04:38:53  <delt0r_> for example the gc typically has its own thread
2011-11-09T04:38:59  <delt0r_> ic
2011-11-09T04:39:13  <delt0r_> should be fine at only 60ms per turn
2011-11-09T04:39:29  <delt0r_> I often run my one with 16 of my own bots a dual core here
2011-11-09T04:39:38  <delt0r_> an old dual core too
2011-11-09T04:40:01  <grom358> yeah I don't get this at all
2011-11-09T04:40:37  <delt0r_> I still really think there is a issue in the code. Would try the Bot in local debug
2011-11-09T04:41:00  <grom358> yeah.. i just don't see how when I got a bunch of checks whenever I do loops
2011-11-09T04:41:15  <grom358> checking the time remaining is > 100ms
2011-11-09T04:41:50  <delt0r_> well that is the thing about bugs... they are unexpected and unintended behavior
2011-11-09T04:41:52  <grom358> the ones timing out.. are timing out on setup
2011-11-09T04:41:53  <delt0r_> :D
2011-11-09T04:42:06  <delt0r_> progress
2011-11-09T04:42:08  <delt0r_> at last

2011-11-09T08:24:45  <Zao> (where "west" and "east" are relative a particular meridian.
2011-11-09T08:24:51  <Zao> (different standards among different people)
2011-11-09T08:26:51  <mcstar> no problem as the edges dont get degenerate
2011-11-09T08:26:55  <mcstar> as long as*

2011-11-09T08:29:14  <antimatroid> as long as he lives :P
2011-11-09T08:29:22  <mcstar> right
2011-11-09T08:32:22  <Zao> mcstar: They project a reasonably orthogonal coordinate system on the continent, with a fixed meridian as "east"
2011-11-09T08:32:52  <mcstar> yep?
2011-11-09T08:32:58  <mcstar> i mean whats your point?

2011-11-09T08:37:30  <RasmusL> i have a weird problem with my pathfinding again o.o
2011-11-09T08:39:36  <RasmusL> it can run through the same parent cell 5+ times in a single path
2011-11-09T08:39:44  <RasmusL> even though that cell is in the closed list :/
2011-11-09T08:39:58  <RasmusL> it almost seems to me as if it isn't hashing properly, but tuples should hash fine

2011-11-09T08:43:36  <delt0r_> did you do the hash function yourself?
2011-11-09T08:43:48  <delt0r_> did you also include a ==

2011-11-09T08:43:54  <delt0r_> you typically need to
2011-11-09T08:44:09  <delt0r_> oh... python does it automagic right?

2011-11-09T08:44:19  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-09T08:44:22  <RasmusL> self.cell is a tuple
2011-11-09T08:44:27  <mcstar> it hashes tuples fine
2011-11-09T08:45:00  <delt0r_> RasmusL: So you do write your own hash function? for python tuples you should no
2011-11-09T08:45:01  <delt0r_> not
2011-11-09T08:45:03  <delt0r_> sorry
2011-11-09T08:45:06  <mcstar> RasmusL: it is entirely possible that A* doesnt like you
2011-11-09T08:45:08  <RasmusL> anyway i do closedset.add(node) then later "if node in closedset" and it doesn't always evaluate to true :/
2011-11-09T08:45:11  <mcstar> you should try BFS first

2011-11-09T09:31:23  <mcstar> that shouldnt happen

2011-11-09T09:31:39  <mcstar> after you scanned all tiles, and no path is found, yo should stop

2011-11-09T09:55:12  <Emrys_> yea no problem

2011-11-09T09:56:43  <delt0r_> can be huge, can be small

2011-11-09T09:57:01  <delt0r_> also depends on how well the C is coded and the interpreted lang is coded
2011-11-09T09:57:05  <Emrys_> noone here used exe based bot ? im the only windows lamer i guess )

2011-11-09T09:57:26  <Anilm3> mcstar: you're great stating the obvious
2011-11-09T09:57:27  <underflow> right, but some language are better to perform some tasks
2011-11-09T09:57:33  <delt0r_> underflow: typically loops in C will be many times faster... outside of that it depends
2011-11-09T09:57:59  <mcstar> exe based bot

2011-11-09T09:58:14  <Emrys_> mcstar: you use one ?
2011-11-09T09:58:33  <mcstar> many people use binaries, that is compiled bots
2011-11-09T09:58:35  <g0llum> underflow, if your question was, do slower langs get more time ? then, no.
2011-11-09T09:58:44  <mcstar> what do you mean exe based?
2011-11-09T09:58:45  <delt0r_> underflow: yes some langs are better/worse at different things... tools in the tool box and all that
2011-11-09T09:58:46  <underflow> delt0r_ that's not my question, i'm talking about ai challenge
2011-11-09T09:58:51  <mcstar> you mean "i am on windows"?
2011-11-09T09:59:04  <Emrys_> i mean bot that works under windows has to be exwe file

2011-11-09T09:59:09  <Emrys_> yea
2011-11-09T09:59:10  <underflow> deltor: if you code in C you have an advantage right ?
2011-11-09T09:59:21  <delt0r_> underflow: it still depends... what are you going to do? a min max tree? neural net? GP?
2011-11-09T09:59:25  <delt0r_> it all depends
2011-11-09T09:59:30  <mcstar> Emrys_: there are many people still using windows, even in this age
2011-11-09T09:59:32  <mcstar> even here
2011-11-09T09:59:46  <MLM-NL> I develop on windows
2011-11-09T09:59:54  <Emrys_> so why noone can give me example command line to run my bot
2011-11-09T09:59:54  <delt0r_> underflow: not necessarily. Debugging in C is slower than "higher" level langs.
2011-11-09T10:00:08  <mcstar> Emrys_: the scripts are working
2011-11-09T10:00:12  <mcstar> which end in .cmd
2011-11-09T10:00:12  <Anilm3> Is there a way to know if a square is occupied on the C++ starter kit?
2011-11-09T10:00:21  <MLM-NL> Emrys_: compile your C or C++ prgram to an .exe
2011-11-09T10:00:39  <thestinger> Anilm3: look at the members of the Square struct, you can check if 'ant' is not -1, etc.
2011-11-09T10:00:41  <MLM-NL> Emrys_: then run the game script with one of the bot arguments set to the path of the .exe
2011-11-09T10:00:42  <Emrys_> so you tell me to just switch one of the bots to my exe thats it ?
2011-11-09T10:00:52  <delt0r_> Emrys_: nothing looks wrong with the command line... but there is a lot of context that we don't know
2011-11-09T10:00:55  <Anilm3> thestinger: thanks!
2011-11-09T10:00:57  <delt0r_> for example where is the exe
2011-11-09T10:01:06  <Emrys_> its there
2011-11-09T10:01:10  <mcstar> lol
2011-11-09T10:01:12  <delt0r_> where is there... etc...
2011-11-09T10:01:13  <mcstar> thats great
2011-11-09T10:01:16  <Emrys_> hhh
2011-11-09T10:01:16  <MLM-NL> Emrys_: replace one of the "python ""...""" lines with "path/to/exe"

2011-11-09T10:01:35  <delt0r_> what is the error

2011-11-09T10:01:55  <delt0r_> etc
2011-11-09T10:01:59  <Emrys_> no error my bot doesnt move the ant
2011-11-09T10:02:09  <Emrys_> sec im gonna try the -E
2011-11-09T10:02:09  <mcstar> Emrys_: first ditch the script, and just type that in to the cli, try that way
2011-11-09T10:02:17  <mcstar> after that if it works use the script
2011-11-09T10:02:25  <MLM-NL> Emrys_: do you get the visualizer display at the end?
2011-11-09T10:02:32  <Emrys_> yea
2011-11-09T10:02:43  <mcstar> than it is indeed working
2011-11-09T10:02:51  <Emrys_> not sure
2011-11-09T10:03:03  <mcstar> does it say your bot crashed?
2011-11-09T10:03:08  <mcstar> or timed out?
2011-11-09T10:03:26  <mcstar> look for those on the slider or int the cli
2011-11-09T10:03:34  <MLM-NL> Emrys_: then just get the bot input from the visualizer, and debug your .exe from vsiual studio (or smth) while inputting that file (use < on the debugging command line)
2011-11-09T10:03:52  <MLM-NL> or just start debug session and type over the input text :P
2011-11-09T10:04:03  <MLM-NL> see if it actually outputs a command

2011-11-09T10:05:29  <MLM-NL> alternatively, have the bot loop on "IsDebuggerPresent()" win API, manually attach debugger, during setup phase
2011-11-09T10:05:50  <MLM-NL> but you have to set the game script to allow a lot of setup time :P
2011-11-09T10:06:03  <MLM-NL> not sure what the cmdline switch was :P
2011-11-09T10:06:47  <MLM-NL> my question: is there any plan to have a "makefile" language added to the automake script?
2011-11-09T10:07:25  <MLM-NL> so I provide a MyBot.makefile instead of MyBot.cc, and I make it so the makefile builds from the first rule?
2011-11-09T10:08:19  <amstan> MLM-NL: makefiles are ignored by the workers
2011-11-09T10:08:38  <MLM-NL> I know
2011-11-09T10:08:42  <amstan> we looked at supporting build systems
2011-11-09T10:08:46  <amstan> i think there's an issue about it

2011-11-09T10:10:23  <MLM-NL> or maybe just a single -I. (add current directory to search path)
2011-11-09T10:10:26  <Emrys_> thanks man got the problem lol
2011-11-09T10:10:38  <Emrys_> buggy command line after all
2011-11-09T10:11:30  <MLM-NL> it would be really easy to add "-I." to the current python script I guess
2011-11-09T10:12:31  <MLM-NL> dunno if it would break anything though, but it's an easy workaround

2011-11-09T10:16:54  <thestinger> adds a directory the the search path for #include
2011-11-09T10:17:23  <thestinger> adding the compilation directory like MLM-NL suggested seems like a good solution

2011-11-09T10:22:05  <mcstar> if you want to use whole libs he's got a point
2011-11-09T10:22:18  <mcstar> but you could upload the .so too
2011-11-09T10:22:27  <mcstar> it might be smaller than the source code
2011-11-09T10:23:25  <amstan> for libraries, can't you just statically include it? as if you wrote it

2011-11-09T10:24:56  <MLM-NL> amstan: it uses paths relative to root, ie #include <lib/internal/config.h>
2011-11-09T10:25:15  <amstan> so you'll have to modify it
2011-11-09T10:25:25  <MLM-NL> that's what I did now :P
2011-11-09T10:25:35  <amstan> yeah...
2011-11-09T10:25:46  <mcstar> MLM-NL: can i ask what that is?
2011-11-09T10:26:11  <amstan> such a change(build systems) should be made well before the contest enters beta
2011-11-09T10:26:13  <MLM-NL> but the replacement is dependant on the path of the actual file, since "" is relative to current, whereas <> is relative to include root
2011-11-09T10:26:14  <mcstar> (what is the 2nd party anyway?)
2011-11-09T10:26:14  <amstan> since it's a big change
2011-11-09T10:26:47  <mcstar> "lib/internal/config.h"
2011-11-09T10:26:55  <MLM-NL> so a file in lib/internal would have to include "config.h" and a file in lib woudl have to include "internal/config.h"
2011-11-09T10:26:57  <mcstar> you just need to replace <> with ""
2011-11-09T10:27:01  <MLM-NL> so it's a not a straight find/replace
2011-11-09T10:27:27  <MLM-NL> my lib only has like 4 directories, so it's easy
2011-11-09T10:27:38  <MLM-NL> I did it manually with a regex
2011-11-09T10:28:08  <MLM-NL> but you can't just open up yoru IDE and "fix" a library
2011-11-09T10:28:13  <MLM-NL> that's why :P
2011-11-09T10:28:18  <MLM-NL> -I.
2011-11-09T10:28:40  <amstan> MLM-NL: what lib is it anyway?
2011-11-09T10:29:12  <MLM-NL> EASTL

2011-11-09T10:33:16  <amstan> MLM-NL: what if you were going to develop something on a platform where EASTL was not supported?
2011-11-09T10:33:19  <MLM-NL> at least add "-I,"

2011-11-09T10:33:44  <amstan> MLM-NL: can you guarantee that it won't break any bots by adding -I. ?
2011-11-09T10:33:58  <MLM-NL> amstan: don't know
2011-11-09T10:34:14  <MLM-NL> I'd say, do it for next contest
2011-11-09T10:34:16  <MLM-NL> as a workaround
2011-11-09T10:34:27  <amstan> for next contest i'm going to try pushing for build systems
2011-11-09T10:34:32  <amstan> see my comments in that issue
2011-11-09T10:34:40  <MLM-NL> or just add MyBot.makefile as a language :P
2011-11-09T10:34:49  <MLM-NL> so you can contorl it manually, if you need to
2011-11-09T10:35:00  <MLM-NL> for those 1% of ppl that care
2011-11-09T10:35:08  <amstan> MLM-NL: but then you get http://aichallenge.org/language_profile.php?language=Makefile
2011-11-09T10:35:28  <amstan> if it is to be implemented, it has to be done properly
2011-11-09T10:35:46  <MLM-NL> well, with a build system, you'd have to fix that as well
2011-11-09T10:36:05  <amstan> with build systems, the compiler will call a compile.sh that must be present
2011-11-09T10:36:09  <amstan> and will execute run.sh
2011-11-09T10:36:26  <mcstar> how can i convince a friend of mine to enter the contest?
2011-11-09T10:36:27  <amstan> if there's a non 0 exit, it'll log the stderr and show it in your profile
2011-11-09T10:36:31  <Minthos> upload a python script to build and execute your <obscure unsupported language with lots of libraries>
2011-11-09T10:36:46  <amstan> Minthos: all within 3 seconds
2011-11-09T10:37:14  <Minthos> amstan: I don't know what the time limit is on the build/test part of uploading something
2011-11-09T10:37:35  <Minthos> but you don't need to compile your bot each time it runs
2011-11-09T10:37:45  <amstan> Minthos: if you have a python script, that script only gets executed when you actually have to run the bot
2011-11-09T10:37:55  <amstan> so your compile time is during the game
2011-11-09T10:38:09  <Minthos> amstan: but you actually have to run the bot in the testing phase of uploading a submission
2011-11-09T10:38:17  <amstan> that too
2011-11-09T10:38:31  <MLM-NL> amstan: I'm just saying that support for libraries would be useful for C/C++, how it's actually done, I don't really care :P
2011-11-09T10:38:33  <amstan> but every end of the game you loose your data, so you have to start from scratch every time
2011-11-09T10:38:43  <amstan> MLM-NL: yes, but i do have to care, lol
2011-11-09T10:39:11  <MLM-NL> amstan: well, I proposed a really easy workaround with "-I."
2011-11-09T10:39:26  <MLM-NL> amstan: but it's a hack, and you seem to want something solid :)
2011-11-09T10:39:33  <MLM-NL> for next time anyway
2011-11-09T10:39:35  <amstan> MLM-NL: but it might break existing bots, i can't implement that right now
2011-11-09T10:39:35  <MLM-NL> for this time
2011-11-09T10:39:47  <amstan> MLM-NL: for next time it should be done properly, since there's time
2011-11-09T10:39:51  <Minthos> amstan: well.. not sure how the rules are and how it's actually implemented, but I'm pretty sure they don't compile your bot for each game
2011-11-09T10:40:19  <amstan> Minthos: they don't, but you're proposing compiling stuff yourself with a python script
2011-11-09T10:40:30  <amstan> Minthos: python scripts won't happen till runtime
2011-11-09T10:40:59  <Minthos> right, and runtime is when the tests get run
2011-11-09T10:41:09  <MLM-NL> dunno if I could compile in 3s
2011-11-09T10:41:13  <Minthos> so you can compile then and never again
2011-11-09T10:41:24  <amstan> Minthos: you don't get to keep files that you write to
2011-11-09T10:41:36  <Minthos> ok
2011-11-09T10:41:48  <MLM-NL> but well, support for makefiles/build system would allow for multi-stage compilation (using profiling data etc) I guess

2011-11-09T10:43:01  <MLM-NL> also, makefiles are an easy attack vector on server I guess
2011-11-09T10:43:18  <amstan> compiling is sandboxed right now

2011-11-09T10:44:27  <amstan> VxDeV: it's hard to get it going, because you do not have any access to build systems
2011-11-09T10:44:30  <Rinum> am I allowed to submit a multi-threaded version of my bot?

2011-11-09T10:44:46  <Minthos> Rinum: no
2011-11-09T10:44:52  <amstan> VxDeV: we were just talking about this, you esentially have to compile your C++ using python every time you start a match
2011-11-09T10:45:00  <VxDeV> well i mean i use python to manage the parsing
2011-11-09T10:45:10  <Rinum> awww, any particular reason why not?

2011-11-09T10:45:40  <amstan> MLM-NL: yes
2011-11-09T10:45:45  <mleise> Rinum: because then your bot would take away cpu cycles from other bots?

2011-11-09T10:46:07  <VxDeV> i thought like using python + subprocess to open an ants executable^^
2011-11-09T10:46:09  <Rinum> okay
2011-11-09T10:46:22  <amstan> VxDeV: that gets you multithreading, which is not allowed
2011-11-09T10:46:26  <VxDeV> it is an linux server isnt it?
2011-11-09T10:46:33  <VxDeV> oh damn it :'(
2011-11-09T10:46:37  <MLM-NL> in that case, maybe I should just compile my entire bot locally with -I. as a .so, then upload a dummy program source that executes the .so
2011-11-09T10:46:48  <amstan> MLM-NL: sure
2011-11-09T10:46:53  <Rinum> amstan: maybe for the next ai challenge it'll be allowed?
2011-11-09T10:47:00  <VxDeV> isnt that multithreading too?^^
2011-11-09T10:47:08  <amstan> Rinum: we're working on that
2011-11-09T10:47:13  <MLM-NL> amstan: but then the source code wouldn't be on your servers
2011-11-09T10:47:18  <Rinum> amstan: looking forward to it :)

2011-11-09T10:47:25  <MLM-NL> amstan: just some dummy code ;P
2011-11-09T10:47:29  <Minthos> VxDeV: not unless the .so creates new threads
2011-11-09T10:47:31  <amstan> MLM-NL: yeah.. we might specify that in the rules next time
2011-11-09T10:47:58  <MLM-NL> I'll try to build a .so first :P
2011-11-09T10:47:58  <mleise> Some languages will be in a big advantage then I think. Does JavaScript (NodeJS) support multi-threading?
2011-11-09T10:48:15  <amstan> Rinum: we should be allowing threads, they're useful and sometimes impossible to avoid(bash bots anyone?)
2011-11-09T10:48:22  <VxDeV> well im not that good in c++, but i want my bot to handle more ants, so i have to use a fast language
2011-11-09T10:48:22  <MLM-NL> not sure if MinGW actually supports .so output :P
2011-11-09T10:48:27  <amstan> Rinum: problem is that we must limit them to one cpu, which is rather hard
2011-11-09T10:48:34  <amstan> Rinum: so we just banned threads for now
2011-11-09T10:48:38  <VxDeV> thats why i want to use python to parse the input, send it to my executable and then send it back^^
2011-11-09T10:48:51  <thestinger> that's multiprocessing
2011-11-09T10:49:00  <Minthos> not necessarily
2011-11-09T10:49:02  <thestinger> using exec() and replacing your executable with another wouldn't be
2011-11-09T10:49:14  <Minthos> you can mix python and c++ in the same process
2011-11-09T10:49:16  <amstan> thestinger: he's just calling c++ functions
2011-11-09T10:49:18  <underflow> is asynchronous programing allowed ?
2011-11-09T10:49:18  <Rinum> amstan: okay, that's understandable... thanks
2011-11-09T10:49:22  <VxDeV> but like one thread
2011-11-09T10:49:33  <Minthos> yes underflow, as long as it's not parallell
2011-11-09T10:49:39  <amstan> underflow: if you mean threads? no, if you mean green-threads yes
2011-11-09T10:49:46  <thestinger> amstan: ah, I didn't realize he meant making a python module or using ctypes
2011-11-09T10:50:11  <VxDeV> me?
2011-11-09T10:50:28  <thestinger> making a C .so file and using ctypes would be really easy
2011-11-09T10:50:37  <VxDeV> never tried, but well its like engine -> python parser -> bot -> output to engine^^
2011-11-09T10:51:51  <mleise> thestinger: the problem with precompiled code is, that participants with AMD64 Linux machines are practically the only ones who can make use of it :(
2011-11-09T10:51:55  <amstan> VxDeV: i just don't get why you need python then
2011-11-09T10:52:17  <Minthos> mleise: the server should be able to run 32-bit linux binaries
2011-11-09T10:52:20  <mleise> And even then you need to be aware of the installed glibc version
2011-11-09T10:52:28  <thestinger> mleise: you can use a VM to compile if you're on windows
2011-11-09T10:52:30  <VxDeV> cos i didnt use c++ for a very long time and im afraid it would take too long^^
2011-11-09T10:52:38  <Minthos> and anyone can install 32-bit linux in a vm and compile stuff

2011-11-09T10:56:53  <VxDeV> so 64 bit is possible?
2011-11-09T10:57:02  <Minthos> VxDeV: yes
2011-11-09T10:57:05  <amstan> it runs on 64 bit

2011-11-09T11:17:40  <thestinger> I tried it :), there needs to be a good balance based on risk (if you and an enemy are the same distance from a food, why are you going to let them have it?)

2011-11-09T11:48:09  <mcstar> but how did it get into it?

2011-11-09T11:48:51  <thestinger> antimatroid: yeah, it's also a really slow way to mark squares as visible :P
2011-11-09T11:49:06  <antimatroid> what way are you doing it?
2011-11-09T11:49:23  <antimatroid> bfs from all ants simultaneously doesn't work
2011-11-09T11:49:28  <antimatroid> and it's messy to do it the other way aha
2011-11-09T11:49:32  <thestinger> well, I just switched it to viewradius2 and euclideandistance2 for now
2011-11-09T11:49:38  <thestinger> it's fast enough after that
2011-11-09T11:49:46  * avdg uses a diff algorithm
2011-11-09T11:49:53  <antimatroid> you mean squared your euclidean metric?
2011-11-09T11:49:57  <thestinger> I'm also marking attack radius stuff the same way, so I should really use one of the matrix ways of doing it
2011-11-09T11:49:58  <antimatroid> i did that for my bot anyway
2011-11-09T11:50:05  <pairofdice> I don't think you can get anywhere near 25 anymore with just gathering and hill attacking
2011-11-09T11:50:08  <thestinger> antimatroid: yeah, I just don't take the sqrt
2011-11-09T11:50:25  <antimatroid> did you turn your grid into a graph?
2011-11-09T11:50:30  <pairofdice> Unless it's otherwise very sophisticated ninja

2011-11-09T11:50:52  <antimatroid> ie. add a vector of neighbour locations to each square and remove appropriate ones as you get water info?
2011-11-09T11:50:57  <antimatroid> mleise: no need for pointers :P;
2011-11-09T11:51:20  <thestinger> not yet, all my BFS stuff is fast enough
2011-11-09T11:51:20  <mleise> oh so it is still in a compact array? neat :)
2011-11-09T11:51:26  <mcstar> then i wont tell you how fast mine is with POINTERS
2011-11-09T11:51:27  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-09T11:51:32  <thestinger> I wasted a bunch of time implementing A* but I'm not using it anymore...
2011-11-09T11:51:36  <antimatroid> it makes pathfinding code way more aesthetically pleasing imo :P
2011-11-09T11:51:42  <mcstar> no "location struct" and "vectors"

2011-11-09T11:53:21  <Antimony> I'm planning on rewriting it but haven't gotten around to it yet
2011-11-09T11:53:32  <Antimony> the annoying thing is how it forces inclusion of windows system headers everywhere
2011-11-09T11:53:38  <Antimony> with all the evil macros they have
2011-11-09T11:53:47  <antimatroid> you can strip all the windows stuff if you're not using windows :P

2011-11-09T11:58:17  <thestinger> something like ntpd can change the wall clock time, so you use the arbitrary CLOCK_MONOTONIC for timing

2011-11-09T12:22:39  <Antimony> the strategy is so different becasue it's a crazy freeforall at the beginning
2011-11-09T12:23:04  <lorill> sort of
2011-11-09T12:23:07  <lorill> I lose all my hills early, except one
2011-11-09T12:23:14  <lorill> so i can revert to my normal strategy
2011-11-09T12:23:17  <lorill> :)
2011-11-09T12:23:38  <conor_f> yeah, I was wondering about defense for multiple maps
2011-11-09T12:23:48  <conor_f> that seems like the best idea I've heard yet :P
2011-11-09T12:24:07  <lorill> looks hard, if you use ants to defend, you'll be way behind in term of population
2011-11-09T12:25:28  <conor_f> yeah

2011-11-09T12:26:21  <lorill> but i get killed by weak bots who don't care about their own ants
2011-11-09T12:26:23  <lorill> i think so
2011-11-09T12:26:35  <lorill> at least my bot is oblivious to it
2011-11-09T12:26:42  <conor_f> that seems like a good plan in that case...

2011-11-09T12:26:56  <pairofdice> You mean keeping an ant on top of the hill?
2011-11-09T12:27:00  <lorill> except you don't get food nor points this way
2011-11-09T12:27:02  <lorill> yes
2011-11-09T12:27:12  <conor_f> or else, I could just have * ants gathering food until the hill is pwned

2011-11-09T12:27:19  <conor_f> then have * ants go for hills
2011-11-09T12:27:36  <conor_f> maybe if they see them while gathering though, theyd need to raze them

2011-11-09T12:28:30  <lorill> that only works against bots that don't go for the kill anyway
2011-11-09T12:28:59  <conor_f> yeah
2011-11-09T12:29:10  <conor_f> so they'd need to attack the whole time so
2011-11-09T12:29:26  <lorill> no
2011-11-09T12:29:45  <lorill> you only need one dumbo to kill your hiding ant, then other players also see you
2011-11-09T12:29:46  <conor_f> I mean if they can see a hill, they should attack it
2011-11-09T12:30:28  <conor_f> I dunno
2011-11-09T12:30:50  <conor_f> I think I'll scrap defense altogether and hope that if I am attacked that I have enough ants spawning to protect it
2011-11-09T12:30:52  <lorill> yeah, back to the drawing board :(
2011-11-09T12:31:10  <mcstar> whoa: "lose all my hills early, except one"
2011-11-09T12:31:12  <mcstar> rly?
2011-11-09T12:31:19  <mcstar> you gonna lose a lot of points
2011-11-09T12:31:34  <mcstar> more importantly you give free points to the enemy
2011-11-09T12:31:36  <lorill> yes, that's why i'm not in the top ten :o

2011-11-09T12:33:21  <ikaros> thats not true.. a good bot will raze an unprotected hill for sure
2011-11-09T12:33:33  <lorill> I also have a problem with only one hill when I get rushed
2011-11-09T12:33:35  <mcstar> we are talking about losing the hills, just when you really encounter enemier
2011-11-09T12:33:44  <mcstar> you need time to evaluate their strenghts
2011-11-09T12:33:59  <lorill> I didn't find any way to defend against that

2011-11-09T12:38:17  <ikaros> check for enemies at your hill in a specified radius.. call 2 nearest ants to defend against each enemy e.g.
2011-11-09T12:40:08  <conor_f> chances are that your ants will be outside that radius though
2011-11-09T12:40:31  <ikaros> depends on how large the radius is :)
2011-11-09T12:40:32  <ikaros> brb

2011-11-09T12:47:47  <conor_f> I'm not exactly the best programmer :P
2011-11-09T12:48:34  <ikaros> do it in small steps. first calculate a distance map for your own hill(s)
2011-11-09T12:48:43  <ikaros> then check those squares for enemy ants
2011-11-09T12:48:52  <pairofdice> I'm the best programmer on opposite day
2011-11-09T12:48:54  <ikaros> its just a bfs
2011-11-09T12:49:44  <conor_f> ikaros: the bfs I have implemented doesn't work always for some reason
2011-11-09T12:50:04  <conor_f> and I can't even keep track of my own ants...
2011-11-09T12:50:13  <conor_f> so I still have a bit to go yet
2011-11-09T12:50:16  <thestinger> why do you need to keep track of your ants? :P
2011-11-09T12:50:20  <ikaros> too much problems at once
2011-11-09T12:50:32  <thestinger> every ant is the same, at the start of every turn it doesn't matter which ant was where last turn
2011-11-09T12:50:37  <ikaros> try to break it down and solve one after the other.. e.g. tracking ants first
2011-11-09T12:50:41  <thestinger> if you're doing stuff with leaders, you can just reassign them each turn
2011-11-09T12:50:50  <pairofdice> Yeah, why would you track your ants?
2011-11-09T12:51:04  <ikaros> but in fact.. im rewriting my whole bot and i think i can skip ant tracking completely
2011-11-09T12:51:07  <pairofdice> One ant is as good as the other
2011-11-09T12:51:28  <conor_f> I'm doing it so I can have some ants attackers, some gatherers
2011-11-09T12:51:35  <conor_f> and they each have different roles
2011-11-09T12:51:37  <thestinger> reassign them every turn
2011-11-09T12:51:41  <ikaros> yea
2011-11-09T12:51:43  <thestinger> based on their proximity to things, etc.
2011-11-09T12:51:45  <conor_f> why would I do that?
2011-11-09T12:51:54  <thestinger> why would you want an ant near an enemy hill to be a gatherer?
2011-11-09T12:51:56  <ikaros> because its easier and you dont need to track them :)
2011-11-09T12:52:00  <pairofdice> Because nothing makes one ant better at gathering food
2011-11-09T12:52:10  <conor_f> no
2011-11-09T12:52:18  <conor_f> ok
2011-11-09T12:52:19  <conor_f> hmmm
2011-11-09T12:52:32  <Savaron> saving the path for each ant is a good way to ensure not all paths need to be calculated again
2011-11-09T12:52:44  <thestinger> you don't need to calculate very many paths
2011-11-09T12:52:50  <conor_f> what about explored areas?
2011-11-09T12:52:53  <ikaros> i dont use a* so no need to remember the paths
2011-11-09T12:53:01  <thestinger> if you want to send 100 ants to a hill, you need one BFS from that hill to pathfind for every single ant
2011-11-09T12:53:26  <Savaron> not for that particular scenario, but generally
2011-11-09T12:53:36  <conor_f> thestinger: yeah
2011-11-09T12:53:43  <conor_f> Thats what I'm doing with food
2011-11-09T12:53:50  <conor_f> but for some reason it's not working :/
2011-11-09T12:54:03  <mcstar> well, my ant tracking code is 23 lines
2011-11-09T12:54:03  <conor_f> ants get stuck in corners and are indecisive
2011-11-09T12:54:05  <thestinger> so for exploration you do the same thing - BFS from unexplored areas (or the other way around)
2011-11-09T12:54:18  <mcstar> so you might as well do it for "just because"
2011-11-09T12:54:24  <ikaros> conor_f, did you try to print your bfs map?
2011-11-09T12:54:27  <ikaros> helps alot :)
2011-11-09T12:54:42  <thestinger> whenever I want to send 1 ant to 1 target (or more), I also need distance measurements to decide which ant to send
2011-11-09T12:55:06  <mcstar> i have an itelligent with c++11 lambda's
2011-11-09T12:55:07  <thestinger> so I don't use my A* implementation at all anymore, because I want a proper distance measurement (not just manhattan distance)
2011-11-09T12:55:15  <mcstar> can ask ants if they want to accept their targets
2011-11-09T12:55:21  <mcstar> if not, searches farther
2011-11-09T12:55:24  <conor_f> thestinger: I also need to implement that. not sending all ants to the one target
2011-11-09T12:55:31  <mcstar> intelligent bfs*
2011-11-09T12:55:41  <conor_f> mcstar: again, smart but difficult for me to code

2011-11-09T13:28:16  <ikaros> i guess we have a misunderstanding here
2011-11-09T13:28:18  <mcstar> "python tools/sample_bots/python/GreedyBot.php"
2011-11-09T13:28:29  <mcstar> joszs: you have to compile your source
2011-11-09T13:28:33  <ikaros> because .cc is your source file
2011-11-09T13:28:36  <ikaros> you cant start it
2011-11-09T13:28:37  <mcstar> than give your executable to the script
2011-11-09T13:28:50  <joszs> but I thought because of the site wanted it to be downloaded without a compile
2011-11-09T13:29:07  <NoxiaZ^> Hmm can anyone help me get this working: http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto ? - Im using C# and i have no idea how to get this running?

2011-11-09T13:31:42  <NoxiaZ^> i tried this?
2011-11-09T13:31:48  <ikaros> if you test it locally you need to compile it yourself and use the tools with the executable
2011-11-09T13:32:07  <NoxiaZ^> But just get an error with "USAGE"
2011-11-09T13:32:25  <joszs> I know now...
2011-11-09T13:32:34  <ikaros> fine :)
2011-11-09T13:32:37  <joszs> I also tried it with a php file
2011-11-09T13:32:46  <joszs> but it didn´t work
2011-11-09T13:32:58  <g0llum> NoxiaZ^ add your username and a password at the end
2011-11-09T13:33:02  <ikaros> paste how you start the tool
2011-11-09T13:33:03  <NoxiaZ^> i did

2011-11-09T13:33:48  <ikaros> the bot only reacts to stdin input.. it wont run on its own
2011-11-09T13:33:51  <mcstar> mono
2011-11-09T13:33:58  <mcstar> do you have mono installed
2011-11-09T13:34:00  <ikaros> you need to use playgame.py or how it is called
2011-11-09T13:34:01  <ikaros> wait
2011-11-09T13:34:09  <NoxiaZ^> no dont have mono installed
2011-11-09T13:34:11  <NoxiaZ^> should i?
2011-11-09T13:34:15  <ikaros> hrhr :)
2011-11-09T13:34:16  <ikaros> sorry
2011-11-09T13:34:18  <mcstar> then why do you expect it to work?

2011-11-09T13:34:30  <g0llum> mcsatr, he's on win
2011-11-09T13:34:41  <mcstar> im not a satire
2011-11-09T13:35:28  <ikaros> joszs, have a look at tools/play_one_game.sh
2011-11-09T13:35:30  <NoxiaZ^> First, i dont expect anything.. - Next g0llum is right im a windows guy, nothing more then that
2011-11-09T13:35:35  <ikaros> to see how to start a game locally
2011-11-09T13:35:43  <NoxiaZ^> But will it work if i install mono?
2011-11-09T13:35:55  <ikaros> it should
2011-11-09T13:36:02  <ikaros> because you call mono to run your program
2011-11-09T13:36:25  <g0llum> NoxiaZ^ no need for mono, you were just lacking username and password there
2011-11-09T13:36:28  <NoxiaZ^> ahh oki, just to know, why cant it just run the exe file?
2011-11-09T13:36:40  <NoxiaZ^> C:\Python32\python.exe "D:\\Programmering\\trunk\\Csharp-scripts\\Privat\\GoogleAIChallange\\LocalPlayTool\\tcpclient.py" ants.fluxid.pl 2081 "mono D:\\Programmering\\trunk\\Csharp-scripts\

2011-11-09T13:36:44  <NoxiaZ^> this is my totaly line
2011-11-09T13:36:49  <joszs> I have.. it is working with python files but not with other files.
2011-11-09T13:38:50  <ikaros> .exe is misleading because it is run by the c# runtime (cli?) and in this case mono instead because of the use of a linux server where M$ .net wont run
2011-11-09T13:39:22  <joszs> "python pythonbot/MyBot.py" is working but "php phpbot/MyBot.php" isn´t
2011-11-09T13:40:07  <ikaros> you probably compiled your code with the ms c# compiler.. you will probably need to compile with mono first
2011-11-09T13:40:22  <ikaros> but im not a mono/.net guy so im not sure about all this :)

2011-11-09T14:43:46  <mleise> maps of locations? but isn't the location the index into the location map?
2011-11-09T14:44:07  <mcstar> mleise: loc is a struct with 4 loc* -s
2011-11-09T14:44:39  <mcstar> and when i receive water, i delete the opposite pointer from the nboring loc
2011-11-09T14:45:28  <mcstar> ah, i mean i reset it to zero, not delete it per say
2011-11-09T14:45:59  <mleise> you null it out, so to say
2011-11-09T14:46:09  <mcstar> i invalidate it :D

2011-11-09T15:21:40  <amstan> maybe $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] is wonky?

I looks quite strange: some parts of "Ants Visualizer" window apper over others. And the bigger I stretch window, the more jitters occure. What could be the reason? I use the latest Java (Version 6 Update 29)? and have already tried to reinstall it. One more thing: there is no jitter after visualizing play_one_game.cmd/

2011-11-09T15:47:53  <Zannick> i inspect element to see <a href="maps.php">Official Maps</a>
2011-11-09T15:48:00  <Zannick> i change that to <a href="/maps.php">Official Maps</a>
2011-11-09T15:48:12  <Zannick> now it links to http://aichallenge.org/maps.php
2011-11-09T15:48:25  <amstan> Zannick: sure, but that's treating the symptoms

2011-11-09T15:48:53  <amstan> grep for Fix bad ghost markup
2011-11-09T15:49:21  <amstan> the ghost in the rankings did not use proper html entities
2011-11-09T15:49:26  <amstan> so some tags didn't get closed
2011-11-09T15:49:39  <amstan> so the robots got confused about the links and started asking for the wrong ones
2011-11-09T15:49:43  <Zannick> it's still correct to do it this way :P
2011-11-09T15:49:55  <amstan> now they keep requesting those wrong links, and they get stored in memcached

2011-11-09T16:01:21  <conor_f> do a bfs from the food outwards
2011-11-09T16:01:34  <jix> but then you'll find the closest ant for each food already

2011-11-09T16:04:53  <magiik> i'm doing something similar conor_f - i do a BFS starting form all the goal nodes

2011-11-09T16:05:01  <magiik> then you just follow the flow to the goals

2011-11-09T16:40:14  <Antimony> When analyzing a fight, do you try to predict what moves the opponent will make, or assume the enemies stay in place, or what?

2011-11-09T16:41:13  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-09T16:41:30  <Antimony> I'm trying to decide how to handle fighting, but it's hard because you don't know what the opponent will do
2011-11-09T16:41:40  <amstan> Antimony: try minimax
2011-11-09T16:41:43  <mcstar> amstan: with excessie logging, it seems the engine doesnt save all of it to the file
2011-11-09T16:41:50  <mcstar> i have a 500k log
2011-11-09T16:41:57  <Antimony> minimax is only for games where you take turns
2011-11-09T16:41:59  <mcstar> but its nowhere near the whole of it
2011-11-09T16:42:03  <Antimony> it doesn't work with uncertainty
2011-11-09T16:42:11  <Antimony> or simulatenous movement
2011-11-09T16:42:13  <mcstar> Antimony: easily extensible to this situation

2011-11-09T17:41:36  <LouisMartin> I'm wondering about something related to the game engine
2011-11-09T17:42:12  <LouisMartin> Does it request every player at once or sequentially?
2011-11-09T17:42:32  <LouisMartin> at once, I guess...
2011-11-09T17:43:02  <treeform> i don't know but if it did it at once would bots fight over CPU/
2011-11-09T17:43:08  <treeform> unless its 1 core per bot or some thing
2011-11-09T17:43:22  <treeform> but what about multi core bots?

2011-11-09T17:44:45  <treeform> haha to mess up the other bots?
2011-11-09T17:44:51  <LouisMartin> yep :)
2011-11-09T17:44:57  <LouisMartin> also,
2011-11-09T17:45:02  <treeform> in theory you could run the CPU at 100% all the time even when its not your turn

2011-11-09T17:45:56  <LouisMartin> if the engine process the players in serie, then you could have some processing between your turns to: 1. mess with others, 2. analyze your data further
2011-11-09T17:46:11  <treeform> yeah i have not though about that

2011-11-09T17:47:30  <treeform> oh here Use of multiple processes or OS threads are prohibited."
2011-11-09T17:47:31  <avdg> well, as long its not a physical threat

2011-11-09T17:47:51  <avdg> you can't create new threats anyway
2011-11-09T17:47:52  <treeform> well i am using nodejs
2011-11-09T17:48:00  <avdg> events are fine ;-)
2011-11-09T17:48:00  <LouisMartin> avdg: a physical threat?
2011-11-09T17:48:05  <treeform> every thing is async so i can use 100% cpu
2011-11-09T17:48:11  <treeform> and still do IO between them
2011-11-09T17:48:17  <Zannick> there are no multicore bots
2011-11-09T17:48:28  <Zannick> and no core contention, i believe
2011-11-09T17:48:30  <treeform> Zannick: you are in charge right?
2011-11-09T17:48:42  <Zannick> i'm not in charge of the workers
2011-11-09T17:48:44  <avdg> LouisMartin: as long its a "fake" threat, its fine
2011-11-09T17:49:01  <Zannick> but i know enough to answer your questions about multithreading
2011-11-09T17:49:42  <treeform> what about languages like erlang?
2011-11-09T17:49:45  <treeform> or go?
2011-11-09T17:49:54  <treeform> with green threads and default multi core things?
2011-11-09T17:50:01  <Zannick> green threads are fine
2011-11-09T17:50:14  <LouisMartin> avdg: you do mean threaD right?   cause you're having me confused with your threat
2011-11-09T17:50:25  <treeform> but don't the language itself grabs all cores?
2011-11-09T17:50:31  <avdg> LouisMartin: ah, srr
2011-11-09T17:50:35  <Zannick> i think how it works is that the running bot only sees one core
2011-11-09T17:50:39  <avdg> updated my dictionary :-)
2011-11-09T17:50:52  <treeform> Zannick: ok i guess that makes sence
2011-11-09T17:51:01  <Zannick> treeform: even if it does, we can tell the kernel that the program only gets one core
2011-11-09T17:51:35  <LouisMartin> avdg: haha   dict xp +1
2011-11-09T17:52:03  <treeform> Zannick: ok yeah that works
2011-11-09T17:52:37  <LouisMartin> Zannick: do you know if the game engine process the players in parallel or in serie?
2011-11-09T17:52:42  <treeform> hmm there is nothing in the rules about making TCP connection to EC2 or some thing and using hundreds of computers?
2011-11-09T17:53:08  <LouisMartin> treeform: yes, no remote connection whatsoever
2011-11-09T17:53:09  <Zannick> LouisMartin: the workers have two cores, so it runs two players on separate cores in parallel
2011-11-09T17:53:18  <Zannick> it pairs players up randomly each turn

2011-11-09T17:55:46  <Zannick> in a game of 4 players, each turn takes up to 2*turntime
2011-11-09T17:55:59  <Zannick> but yes, they'd be paused
2011-11-09T17:56:46  * avdg wonders if there was a game taking longer than 30 min
2011-11-09T17:57:10  <avdg> uh wait
2011-11-09T17:57:20  <avdg> wrong calculation
2011-11-09T17:57:33  <LouisMartin> ok. paused as in their thread froze or paused as in "waiting for their turn (update) in a cute loop" ?
2011-11-09T17:58:13  <LouisMartin> *Zannick
2011-11-09T17:58:52  <Zannick> froze
2011-11-09T17:59:05  <Zannick> if they're looping, they're paused somewhere in the loop
2011-11-09T17:59:24  <Zannick> realistically, they're blocked on turn input
2011-11-09T18:00:18  <LouisMartin> right, okay. makes sens.  for a second, I thought it may be possible to process data between turns while waiting.
2011-11-09T18:00:35  <LouisMartin> I guess that makes me an optimist
2011-11-09T18:00:57  <Zannick> yeah, you probably cannot

2011-11-09T18:12:29  <NoxiaZ^> You would only slow down you self then if you dont know what you are doing?

2011-11-09T18:20:44  <amstan> LouisMartin: the point of that rule is to not use more than one core, or to not execute more than one thread at the same time

2011-11-09T18:21:55  <treeform> NoxiaZ^: green threads are threads that don't use OS mechanism to do threads.
2011-11-09T18:22:42  <treeform> they are normally very cheap and languages that use them can create 1000's of them...

2011-11-09T18:51:42  <LouisMartin> there's already a dispatcher somewhere taking care of "events" .. maybe we can just hook up to this one as this one is sure to be in the mono implementation. the Dispatcher that I've looked up (the url) is marked v4 of the .net framework
2011-11-09T18:52:14  <NoxiaZ^> Ahh oki, then for sure it isnt in mono
2011-11-09T18:52:52  <LouisMartin> seems like there's a version in v3 and v3.5 as well, so mono probably support it.
2011-11-09T18:53:11  <amstan> ah come on! still not done
2011-11-09T18:54:07  <NoxiaZ^> What would happen if we use this method from ThreadPool

2011-11-09T19:00:43  <Extrarius> 'green threads' are like normal threads except that instead of being pre-empted by the OS after you run a while, you run until you tell the 'OS' to run a different thread
2011-11-09T19:00:58  <LouisMartin> there's no thread-confined concurrent execution in C#.   Not build out-of-the-box anyway.  the Dispatcher is neat if you want prioritize and run as much stuff in a certain timespan, but that's about it.

2011-11-09T20:47:02  <userjjb_> At first I thought I might slowly build up a database of optimal paths from each square to each other square, but in a 200x200 map this would require around 3.2 Gb of memory. What do people do in this respect?
2011-11-09T20:47:08  <nickjohnson> Also potentially of interest: http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2002/AAAI02-072.pdf

2011-11-09T20:47:45  <nickjohnson> userjjb_: You don't need to pathfind between every square and every other, though - your ants all have the same general goals, right? Collaborative Diffusion lets you use simple hill-climbing

2011-11-09T20:48:15  <Antimony> there's no need to store paths
2011-11-09T20:48:26  <Antimony> I do A* from food to ants every turn and it doesn't take much time

2011-11-09T20:49:44  <nickjohnson> For instance, you don't really need to be able to pathfind from any ant to any food, do you? You need to be able to pathfind from any ant to the _closest_ food

2011-11-09T21:03:58  * nickjohnson thinks the Python starter kit needs some serious improvement
2011-11-09T21:03:59  <amstan> roflmao: you might even be able to use the food spawns for predicting
2011-11-09T21:04:03  <roflmao> so then I can predict where enemy ant hills are
2011-11-09T21:04:08  <roflmao> and what the terrain looks like
2011-11-09T21:04:13  <amstan> idk if multiple foods can spawn at the same time, but if they do, it's super easy after that
2011-11-09T21:04:13  <roflmao> and all sorts of fun little things
2011-11-09T21:04:29  <roflmao> ah so even the food spawning is symmetric
2011-11-09T21:04:30  <Rinum> how many possible paths are there for, say, a 100x100 map.... hmmm
2011-11-09T21:04:37  <amstan> roflmao: yes, you need to get a function that gives you all the other symmetric points given one of them
2011-11-09T21:04:49  <amstan> roflmao: ala my symmetry vector functions
2011-11-09T21:05:01  <amstan> and once you have that to get the other hills is trivial
2011-11-09T21:05:02  <roflmao> ah I see where you're going
2011-11-09T21:05:13  <roflmao> so I can look at how you do it for mapgen
2011-11-09T21:05:15  <Rinum> each loc going to every other loc... so loc 1 has 100x100 paths.... with 100x100 locs.... 100^4 paths?
2011-11-09T21:05:15  <amstan> you just plug in the hill that you have and you'll get all opponent hills

2011-11-09T21:06:06  <userjjb_> nickjohnson: Thinking about it a ilttle more, I think an adaptive grid that oicks a point and expands a square outward until it hits a wall/other region and then moving it so it can continue to expand until it's constrained on all four sides would be a good way to fill the map since walls tend to be densely packed would be a perfect implementation since within any region there would be no obstacles
2011-11-09T21:06:21  <roflmao> so .. some maps ARE not identically symmetrical then?
2011-11-09T21:06:23  <nickjohnson> Rinum: Yes, but you don't really need shortest-path routes from every square to every other.

2011-11-09T21:07:00  <amstan> roflmao: it's essentially the same map, but the symmetry vector is not valid anymore without modification
2011-11-09T21:07:12  <roflmao> ah
2011-11-09T21:07:15  <roflmao> because it is offset
2011-11-09T21:07:16  <nickjohnson> I saw a great article a while ago on game pathfinding that showed how to avoid the need to expand the A* search for large areas of empty space, but I can't find it now

2011-11-09T21:07:27  <roflmao> so the map can be symmetrical in its proportions
2011-11-09T21:07:31  <nickjohnson> Rinum: The shortest representation is to store (current square, destination square, next direction) tuples
2011-11-09T21:07:31  <roflmao> but the symmetry might not "be complete"
2011-11-09T21:07:50  <nickjohnson> Rinum: You only ever need to store the next step, not the whole path

2011-11-09T21:08:04  <roflmao> it would be quite quite easy
2011-11-09T21:08:35  <nickjohnson> Rinum: But I'm pointing out that you don't need all-points pathfinding - your ants only need to find the closest food, for instance, and you can do that with a heatmap and hill-clibmign
2011-11-09T21:08:37  <nickjohnson> er,  climbing

2011-11-09T21:18:19  <datachomper> I thought I implemented CD, but then I read that thread on the forums and I think maybe I didn't
2011-11-09T21:18:30  <nickjohnson> How did you do it?
2011-11-09T21:19:20  <datachomper> Mark all my targets as 1, then increase by 1 for every space around each target bfs-like
2011-11-09T21:19:31  <magiik> i think there are different ways to implement and model CD
2011-11-09T21:19:36  <datachomper> Then have the ants just go to the lowest neighbor
2011-11-09T21:19:39  <nickjohnson> ah
2011-11-09T21:19:44  <magiik> mine is more like multiple BFSes with 1 start goal
2011-11-09T21:19:46  <nickjohnson> Yeah, that's different
2011-11-09T21:19:46  <magiik> then i add them all together
2011-11-09T21:19:48  <magiik> to get my diffusion map
2011-11-09T21:20:07  <nickjohnson> How do you determine the value of a square that isn't next to a source?
2011-11-09T21:20:11  <nickjohnson> Or sink,really
2011-11-09T21:20:17  <magiik> diffusion....
2011-11-09T21:20:29  <magiik> sort of like a BFS search, but instead of just incrementing - you do a diffusion of the score
2011-11-09T21:20:49  <magiik> i have mine set up so that different goals diffuse at different weights and rates
2011-11-09T21:21:09  <magiik> e.g. my explroe goals hardly drop off in value going from square to square
2011-11-09T21:21:11  <nickjohnson> So you do iterate over the whole map diffusing values from the previous step
2011-11-09T21:21:13  <datachomper> nickjohnson:  Two ways, first is a bfs for each sink if I have under x number of sinks, otherwise I'll iterate over the map a few times linerally because it's faster
2011-11-09T21:21:18  <nickjohnson> Rather than trying to do some sort of source-specific diffusion?
2011-11-09T21:21:19  <magiik> i don't iterate over the whole map
2011-11-09T21:21:30  <magiik> i start at a point, and "grow" and diffuse into the grown tiles
2011-11-09T21:21:44  <magiik> i also have some early exit conditions - like if the diffusion value gets below X, then just stop
2011-11-09T21:21:48  <nickjohnson> But how do you handle multiple paths to the same destination tile?
2011-11-09T21:22:02  <magiik> and i actually have negative and positive goals
2011-11-09T21:22:08  <magiik> i use doubles, with the map init'd to 0s
2011-11-09T21:22:38  <magiik> negative weights to repel, positive to attract
2011-11-09T21:22:46  <nickjohnson> The one thing that bothers me about 'proper' CD is that the stable state of it is with the map saturated at the temperature of the hottest source
2011-11-09T21:22:58  <nickjohnson> It seems like a good algorithm should stabilize to a nice hill-climb instead
2011-11-09T21:23:14  <magiik> hrm... my implemtation is the hill-climb
2011-11-09T21:23:31  <magiik> dunno how u get a "stable state" of all hot
2011-11-09T21:23:41  <magiik> i re-calculate the diffusion map every turn
2011-11-09T21:24:08  <magiik> i think i'm not doing CD... but what i imagine it to be
2011-11-09T21:24:18  <magiik> it seems like others are using some sort of iterative algorithm
2011-11-09T21:24:19  <nickjohnson> Collaborative Diffusion uses a persistent map, that gets updated with the diffusion equation each step
2011-11-09T21:24:29  <magiik> define step
2011-11-09T21:24:38  <magiik> when i say iterative, i mean over multiple turns

2011-11-09T21:26:39  <magiik> because i couldn't be arsed to implement it in a way to update the map
2011-11-09T21:26:46  <magiik> and i can do thousands of these calcs in C++ without a problem
2011-11-09T21:27:07  <nickjohnson> Hm, one way to make it stabilize more sensibly would be to make each tile 'lose' some heat to the environment
2011-11-09T21:27:09  <magiik> i guess my CD is a bit different
2011-11-09T21:27:14  <nickjohnson> Instead of making it totally conserved
2011-11-09T21:27:23  <nickjohnson> Yes, you're doing something almost-but-not-quite-like CD
2011-11-09T21:27:36  <magiik> i'm doing a map of "instant" diffusion
2011-11-09T21:27:40  <magiik> not diffusion over time
2011-11-09T21:27:49  <datachomper> Yea, same here I guess
2011-11-09T21:27:58  <magiik> http://pastebin.com/7HYfp30x
2011-11-09T21:28:03  <magiik> my maps turn out like that
2011-11-09T21:28:08  <magiik> too bad pastebin is wordwrapping it
2011-11-09T21:28:30  <magiik> so i get a "topographic" map pretty much every time ( for my far diffusing goals )
2011-11-09T21:28:40  <nickjohnson> magiik: You never said how you handled multiple paths to the same square
2011-11-09T21:28:41  <magiik> for my not far diffusing goals, i get lots of areas that are still 0 from init
2011-11-09T21:28:48  <magiik> multiple paths to the same square?
2011-11-09T21:28:50  <magiik> what u mean?
2011-11-09T21:28:58  <magiik> with this map, i can path from any tile
2011-11-09T21:29:08  <nickjohnson> Imagine a 2x2 rect. I can get from the top left to the lower right by two paths
2011-11-09T21:29:19  <Rinum> when you guys say 'CD', what do you mean?
2011-11-09T21:29:22  <magiik> yes, both would be "equal" in my diffusion map
2011-11-09T21:29:25  <nickjohnson> Do you take the min of them, or do you make squares with more paths to the destination more attractive?
2011-11-09T21:29:40  <nickjohnson> Rinum: http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf
2011-11-09T21:29:49  <magiik> the algorithm doesn't think like that
2011-11-09T21:29:59  <magiik> let me try to re-phrase how my algo works
2011-11-09T21:30:06  <magiik> let's say it's just 1 goal
2011-11-09T21:30:12  <Rinum> nickjohnson: thanks
2011-11-09T21:30:16  <nickjohnson> magiik: Well, you're doing something, if only by default - BFS will effectively take the min.
2011-11-09T21:30:35  <magiik> i give that goal an initial weight, let's say 1.0, and i give it a decay rate, let's say 0.5
2011-11-09T21:30:42  <magiik> in BFS with a 2x2 rect - both paths are equal
2011-11-09T21:30:51  <magiik> starting from top left, a move to top right or bottom left is the same score
2011-11-09T21:30:59  <magiik> i give that goal an initial weight, let's say 1.0, and i give it a decay rate, let's say 0.5
2011-11-09T21:31:11  <magiik> so on that map, i "diffuse" the goal out
2011-11-09T21:31:16  <magiik> each tile next to the 1.0 is 0.5
2011-11-09T21:31:20  <magiik> each tile out from that, is 0.25
2011-11-09T21:31:21  <magiik> etc...
2011-11-09T21:31:26  <magiik> then just follow the values up
2011-11-09T21:31:28  <magiik> to get to the goal
2011-11-09T21:31:39  <magiik> i make this more complicated by adding all of the maps together
2011-11-09T21:31:49  <magiik> well ( the ones iw ant to add together )
2011-11-09T21:32:01  <roflmao> is bfs a diffusion map?
2011-11-09T21:32:03  <magiik> and then you get a nice "topographic" map
2011-11-09T21:32:27  <magiik> roflmao: i think you could consider it one, it may not be implemented the same, but in the end yes
2011-11-09T21:32:43  <magiik> i see BFS as the other way around though
2011-11-09T21:32:53  <magiik> the goal is the "sink" and values increase from the sink, so you follow the values down
2011-11-09T21:32:58  <magiik> it's like diffusion in reverse kind of
2011-11-09T21:33:01  <roflmao> aaaah
2011-11-09T21:33:04  <roflmao> yea I get it
2011-11-09T21:33:11  <roflmao> now q, when would you use diffusion instead of bfs?
2011-11-09T21:33:19  <magiik> or in my model, it's diffusion with a positive decay rate ( meaning it grows )
2011-11-09T21:33:28  <roflmao> I assume diffusion has a more limited scope
2011-11-09T21:33:34  <magiik> i use diffusion to get finer grained control of a BFS
2011-11-09T21:33:41  <roflmao> makes sense
2011-11-09T21:34:13  <magiik> the way i see it, each "goal" is like a mountain, the slope exponential - but with different slopes as the decay rate is diff for each
2011-11-09T21:34:34  <magiik> so by doing my diffusion, i can add a bunch of mountains together of all different shapes and sizes to get emergent behavior
2011-11-09T21:34:49  <magiik> set my own ants as negative weights - means ants will try to get away from each other
2011-11-09T21:35:07  <magiik> limit food decay rate to 7 tiles - ants will only ever "see" food difussion from 7 tiles away
2011-11-09T21:35:10  <magiik> things like that
2011-11-09T21:36:07  <magiik> i didn't like BFS's "hard" set paths
2011-11-09T21:36:20  <magiik> and this allows me to sort of play with the paths based on current conditions
2011-11-09T21:36:42  <magiik> set an enemy hill as a positive weight, but enemy ants as negative = try to attack hills, but don't attack if lots of ants are next to it
2011-11-09T21:37:01  <magiik> it works nicely for exploration
2011-11-09T21:37:12  <magiik> but compared to other top bots, it is completely lacking in fine-tuning combat
2011-11-09T21:37:38  <magiik> almost need to do some sort of lookahead/minimax on a small scale around battles
2011-11-09T21:37:51  <magiik> but i havn't had the inspiration or time to implement something like that yet
2011-11-09T21:38:39  <magiik> aite gotta run, im out peace

2011-11-09T22:57:19  <Extrarius> select a random direction, then do random walk, except the options are forward, left, or right. You could also keep a history of the worm's movements like the tail in the "snake game" (nibbles) and don't let it cross its own path
2011-11-09T22:58:31  <Extrarius> you could also do something like make the worm's size start large (say equal to the vision radius) and decrease over time to make bases be in 'caverns' with 'caves' and 'tunnels' between them

2011-11-09T23:02:46  <Chris_0076> voronoi is good for valleys and natural forms
2011-11-09T23:04:23  <Extrarius> you can make good caves with triangulation/cellular algorithms, but I haven't seen any that generate the kind of symmetry needed
2011-11-09T23:04:34  <amstan> Extrarius: don't worry about that
2011-11-09T23:05:26  <Extrarius> well, in 200x200 there isn't a lot of room for the kind of detail triangulation/cellular algorithms generate that is their strength, much less when you split the space between players
