2011-07-15T07:09:17  <MikeTheAnt2> rabidus: Ok, so I should do nothing to my bot now?
2011-07-15T07:09:49  <rabidus> that was for the rankings
2011-07-15T07:10:04  <rabidus> you should check your source code and check that your bot doesn't do any illegal moves
2011-07-15T07:10:24  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it would be one way to do it, yes
2011-07-15T07:10:37  <rabidus> for ie. you are not trying to move someone others ant etc.
2011-07-15T07:10:50  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it would also make it a very hard game
2011-07-15T07:11:03  <jmcarthur> compared to now
2011-07-15T07:11:48  <mcstar> rabidus: i dont think that'd be a problem
2011-07-15T07:11:50  <jmcarthur> because it would be win/lose instead of scored, so you can't just look a few turns ahead to see what is locally best to do
2011-07-15T07:13:42  <MikeTheAnt2> rabidus: ok, thanks
2011-07-15T07:13:50  <rabidus> but that was just a guess
2011-07-15T07:14:53  <MikeTheAnt2> Difficult to debug as it works on my local game engine. Why is there different rules on the one you download than the one on the server?
2011-07-15T07:15:04  <mcstar> there arent
2011-07-15T07:15:09  <mcstar> you just dont have the latest
2011-07-15T07:15:20  <MikeTheAnt2> ok
2011-07-15T07:15:34  <MikeTheAnt2> So I sould update then
2011-07-15T07:15:36  <MikeTheAnt2> thanks
2011-07-15T07:17:26  <MikeTheAnt2> Is there a version indicated somewhere?
2011-07-15T07:17:44  <mcstar> i dont think so
2011-07-15T07:17:54  <MikeTheAnt2> ok
2011-07-15T07:18:01  <mcstar> judt download the archive from github
2011-07-15T07:18:54  <MikeTheAnt2> ok, will do, thanks
2011-07-15T07:19:24  <jmcarthur> we should version the tools
2011-07-15T07:20:42  <mcstar> jmcarthur: you like extra complications?
2011-07-15T07:20:59  <MikeTheAnt2> it would make it easier to knwo when you are out-of-date.
2011-07-15T07:21:41  <mcstar> then you'd have to read changelogs
2011-07-15T07:21:55  <mcstar> but this way, you always test with the lates, before you try uploding
2011-07-15T07:22:01  <mcstar> latestr
2011-07-15T07:22:03  <mcstar> helll
2011-07-15T07:22:41  <MikeTheAnt2> true, it is difficult when there are a lot of versions released all the time.

2011-07-15T07:30:51  <mcstar> lol
2011-07-15T07:30:57  <mcstar> what did you do?
2011-07-15T07:31:22  <MikeTheAnt2> I grabbed the Ants zip from the GIT. Probably not the way it should be done.. :)
2011-07-15T07:31:48  <mcstar> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-07-15T07:31:55  <mcstar> and click the download on the right side
2011-07-15T07:32:02  <mcstar> it this is what you did, thats alrgith
2011-07-15T07:32:29  <mcstar> (my fingers are dislexic it seems)
2011-07-15T07:33:00  <MikeTheAnt2> that's what I did..
2011-07-15T07:33:15  <MikeTheAnt2> ohh, wait, I went in to the ants folder and did just that
2011-07-15T07:33:17  <mcstar> so, how do you know something is missing?
2011-07-15T07:33:32  <MikeTheAnt2> It wont run
2011-07-15T07:33:45  <mcstar> did you extract the whole archive?
2011-07-15T07:33:52  <MikeTheAnt2> And the file "engine" is missing
2011-07-15T07:34:23  <mcstar> ?
2011-07-15T07:36:03  <MikeTheAnt2> sry, I'm probably doing it wrong. I just grabbed the zip, extracted it and then tried to start the "play_one_game" batch file.
2011-07-15T07:37:18  <MikeTheAnt2> c:\Projects\Antfarm\Tools2>play_one_game_custom.cmd Traceback (most recent call last):   File "c:\Projects\Antfarm\Tools2\playgame.py", line 18, in <module>     from engine import run_game Import  Error: No module named engine
2011-07-15T07:37:54  <MikeTheAnt2> and the file "engine", that I got earlier when I downloaded this, is missing in the new folder I just extracted
2011-07-15T07:38:32  <mcstar> waaaaait
2011-07-15T07:38:35  <mcstar> where are those files?
2011-07-15T07:38:53  <mcstar> thats why i was asking you "did you extract everything?"
2011-07-15T07:39:01  <mcstar> it needs its directory structure
2011-07-15T07:39:14  <mcstar> the playgame.py whihch is inside ants/
2011-07-15T07:39:26  <mcstar> needs the engine.py which is in worker/
2011-07-15T07:39:32  <mcstar> ok?
2011-07-15T07:39:40  <mcstar> dont pull those files out of their place
2011-07-15T07:40:00  <mcstar> just move the whole extracted folder
2011-07-15T07:40:06  <mcstar> wherever you like it
2011-07-15T07:43:36  <MikeTheAnt2> yeah, now I got it. thanks!
2011-07-15T07:44:00  <mcstar> np
2011-07-15T07:44:01  <MikeTheAnt2> And I also got the same problem with my bot, so it's time to do some debuging!  :)

2011-07-15T09:14:40  <eashoka> for the beta site no confirmation email will be sent (AFAIK) all you have to do is to click the link 'activate account' in the page appearing immediately after creating the user and you are set. but you have a problem now as you no longer have that page, suggest you create a new account and this time don't loose the reply page of user creation. :-)

2011-07-15T09:57:12  <bhasker> morning
2011-07-15T09:57:20  <mcstar> afternoon
2011-07-15T09:57:43  <mcstar> how is your bot doing?
2011-07-15T09:57:47  <bhasker> 72 ish!
2011-07-15T09:57:53  <bhasker> hanging out around that point
2011-07-15T09:58:07  <mcstar> are there enought games?
2011-07-15T09:58:13  <bhasker> yea
2011-07-15T09:58:14  <mcstar> i wasnt paying much attention to that
2011-07-15T10:00:00  <bhasker> i think my bot's basic strategy is now fine, need to add intelligence for it to make more intelligent decisions about whom to attack and when
2011-07-15T10:01:20  <bhasker> and i realized i need to make a few more changes when checking out moves as i move the ants serially one after the other and sometimes ants may move positions after i used them to resolve a battle
2011-07-15T10:01:25  <mcstar> antimat. said his bot is pretty simple, but still holds 11th, right?
2011-07-15T10:01:29  <bhasker> which makes for suboptimal moves
2011-07-15T10:01:38  <bhasker> i doubt his bot is as simple as he claims:)
2011-07-15T10:01:48  <mcstar> yo think? :D
2011-07-15T10:01:52  <bhasker> yea
2011-07-15T10:04:17  <bhasker> how is your bot doing?
2011-07-15T10:04:31  <bhasker> btw anyone here know where the tcp server code is
2011-07-15T10:04:36  <bhasker> i might take a stab at getting it working
2011-07-15T10:06:28  <mcstar> you can find it in mcleo's github repository, or a modded one in b.erak's
2011-07-15T10:06:35  <mcstar> as far as i know
2011-07-15T10:06:47  <mcstar> im writing a state-transition logic right now
2011-07-15T10:06:56  <mcstar> a sort of decision-table wtf

2011-07-15T10:10:03  <bhasker> i have mcleo's copy but thats for planetwars
2011-07-15T10:10:09  <bhasker> if berak has done some work to get it working for ants
2011-07-15T10:10:15  <bhasker> then i will use his as a base
2011-07-15T10:10:17  <bhasker> do you have a link
2011-07-15T10:10:47  <berak> put it down, wait a sec, goin to put it up again
2011-07-15T10:16:20  <bhasker> how far along are you in getting it working berak?
2011-07-15T10:16:40  <bhasker> if i get it up and running i am thinking we can set it to run on an AWS micro instance
2011-07-15T10:17:01  <bhasker> the free tier lets one setup a single micro instance, i can just host it there for now
2011-07-15T10:17:22  <bhasker> micro instance should be sufficient to run a few games
2011-07-15T10:17:31  <bhasker> we can setup a few of them with different aws accounts for people to play
2011-07-15T10:18:03  <bhasker> can you mail me the link to your repo at hbhasker at yahoo dot com
2011-07-15T10:18:17  <bhasker> i have to step out right now, but will take a stab at it and see if i can get some stuff done
2011-07-15T10:18:24  <berak> oh, got pretty lazy, let me put it on github again
2011-07-15T10:20:40  <bhasker> 73.29 oh goodie goodie
2011-07-15T10:20:48  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=86357&user=13
2011-07-15T10:20:53  <bhasker> mcstar a game that my bot just won
2011-07-15T10:24:26  <mcstar> bhasker: its kind of jittery, when ants are idle, you just move them around randomly?
2011-07-15T10:24:56  <bhasker> well they move to the oldest square around them
2011-07-15T10:25:01  <bhasker> each ant tracks its history
2011-07-15T10:25:08  <bhasker> and just moves to oldest square around it
2011-07-15T10:25:22  <bhasker> seems to work fine for exploring
2011-07-15T10:25:35  <mcstar> hm, i havent thought of that
2011-07-15T10:25:41  <bhasker> i had some complicated logic of figuring out frontlines etc
2011-07-15T10:25:51  <mcstar> i was doing some tests with a kind of potential method
2011-07-15T10:25:52  <bhasker> but that took too much cpu and just didnt work right
2011-07-15T10:25:59  <bhasker> yea i tried potential earlier too
2011-07-15T10:26:07  <mcstar> im gonna use it i think
2011-07-15T10:26:08  <bhasker> but that would get stuck in local maxima's etc
2011-07-15T10:26:18  <bhasker> ants would just sit and do nothing
2011-07-15T10:26:23  <mcstar> well, id use it for spreading
2011-07-15T10:26:33  <bhasker> well your potential calculations better be stable
2011-07-15T10:26:37  <bhasker> otherwise ants do stupid things
2011-07-15T10:26:50  <bhasker> this strategy seems to work fine for me
2011-07-15T10:26:51  <bhasker> for now
2011-07-15T10:27:06  <bhasker> ant expands pretty fast
2011-07-15T10:27:07  <mcstar> its not ONLY potential based, it just would give them a general direction, where are less ants of its own kind
2011-07-15T10:27:08  <bhasker> it could do better
2011-07-15T10:27:25  <bhasker> ah k
2011-07-15T10:27:30  <mcstar> you seem to move multiple ants for the same food though
2011-07-15T10:27:38  <bhasker> that can happen
2011-07-15T10:27:44  <bhasker> since i give orders serially
2011-07-15T10:27:55  <bhasker> sometimes the closest ant gets its orders later
2011-07-15T10:28:06  <bhasker> so you may see multiple ants move at the same time
2011-07-15T10:28:13  <bhasker> also i have a concept of adhoc squad formations
2011-07-15T10:28:22  <bhasker> when an enemy is encountered, ants will move as a squad
2011-07-15T10:28:28  <mcstar> you dont remove the food, that has an ant associated?
2011-07-15T10:28:38  <bhasker> i don't
2011-07-15T10:28:49  <bhasker> since my current code doesn't always find the closest ant for the food
2011-07-15T10:28:55  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-15T10:28:56  <bhasker> it just picks an ant and routes it to closest food to that ant
2011-07-15T10:29:01  <bhasker> so i track path lengths to each food
2011-07-15T10:29:07  <bhasker> from the closest ant
2011-07-15T10:29:17  <bhasker> and if i find another ant with a shorter path to the same food i let it go at it
2011-07-15T10:30:17  <mcstar> i dont see the squads
2011-07-15T10:30:22  <mcstar> or any formation
2011-07-15T10:30:30  <bhasker> well not technically formation let me show you
2011-07-15T10:30:42  <bhasker> they don't persist across turns
2011-07-15T10:32:05  <bhasker> this game is probably not the best
2011-07-15T10:32:07  <bhasker> let me find another
2011-07-15T10:33:28  <bhasker> the problem is my stupid bot is always coming 2nd or 3rd!
2011-07-15T10:33:30  <bhasker> rarely first
2011-07-15T10:33:39  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-15T10:33:51  <mcstar> coming first is a bitch, i dont want it
2011-07-15T10:33:52  <bhasker> you would thinkg that at 73 rating it would win at least 1-2 games every now and then
2011-07-15T10:35:40  <bhasker> if you watch this game http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=83495&user=13
2011-07-15T10:35:52  <bhasker> youw ill see occassionaly ants will cluster together kill an enemy ant
2011-07-15T10:35:54  <bhasker> and then spread out
2011-07-15T10:35:56  <bhasker> again
2011-07-15T10:36:05  <bhasker> thats usually a squad formed and disbandded
2011-07-15T10:38:00  <bhasker> anyway gotta run now
2011-07-15T10:38:03  <bhasker> l8rs

2011-07-15T14:04:59  <sir_macelon> hi
2011-07-15T14:07:34  <mleise> why do i see 2 amstan and 3 accoun?
2011-07-15T14:07:47  <amstan> mleise: there's only 1 amstan
2011-07-15T14:07:51  <mleise> i think my irc client is broken
2011-07-15T14:07:54  <amstan> reconnect?
2011-07-15T14:08:26  <mleise> mmm...no the chat is still working
2011-07-15T14:09:07  <sir_macelon> are there any news about the ranking page? it got stuck on some old data
2011-07-15T14:09:10  <mleise> amstan: what is the status of our little project?
2011-07-15T14:09:21  <amstan> little?
2011-07-15T14:09:41  <mleise> compared to kde yes
2011-07-15T14:10:42  <amstan> compared to kde everything is little
2011-07-15T14:11:54  <mleise> eclipse isn't little compared to kde, but what is the status mr project manager :p
2011-07-15T14:12:16  <amstan> well.. we still have a bunch of bugs
2011-07-15T14:12:21  <sir_macelon> i would even help you out with it, but you don't use java apparently
2011-07-15T14:12:30  <amstan> pretty big ones: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/rankings.php
2011-07-15T14:12:46  <mleise> that's a short list
2011-07-15T14:12:51  <amstan> yes
2011-07-15T14:13:02  <amstan> and i think janzert and mcleopold are busy for a week
2011-07-15T14:13:23  <mleise> ok that explains the problem with the ranking page
2011-07-15T14:14:11  <mleise> are there other blockers?
2011-07-15T14:14:24  <amstan> no, i think that's it
2011-07-15T14:15:17  <mleise> great :) so the workers don't die any more when there are http problems?
2011-07-15T14:16:03  <mleise> I had mercy with FF5 and disabled the button shadows there. And for Chrome 12 as well, since they weren't blurred there
2011-07-15T14:16:37  <amstan> oh yay.. gcc is done compiling
2011-07-15T14:16:54  <mleise> gcc is one hell of a compile :/
2011-07-15T14:17:21  <mleise> I use Gentoo you know... I compiled dozens of gcc releases :p
2011-07-15T14:17:47  <amstan> i need a special version for http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/MSP430_LaunchPad_(MSP-EXP430G2)
2011-07-15T14:18:02  <sir_macelon> just to give you a clue: the rankings page shows the status from midnight 12/13th July
2011-07-15T14:18:12  <amstan> sir_macelon: oh?
2011-07-15T14:18:43  <sir_macelon> check flags rating: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile_games.php?user=7&page=2
2011-07-15T14:18:56  <sir_macelon> and mine: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile_games.php?user=16&page=2
2011-07-15T14:18:56  <amstan> well that's why: OperationalError: (1242, 'Subquery returns more than 1 row')
2011-07-15T14:19:03  <mleise> amstan: is that a board with microcontroller and usb host?
2011-07-15T14:19:15  <mleise> or is it an usb client only?
2011-07-15T14:19:22  <amstan> mleise: nah.. the usb is just for programming
2011-07-15T14:19:27  <sir_macelon> you can check other 9 players also, but I am pretty sure somthing has happened then
2011-07-15T14:19:27  <amstan> it's a poor man's arduino
2011-07-15T14:19:30  <amstan> $4.30
2011-07-15T14:19:35  <amstan> sir_macelon: restarted worker/manager
2011-07-15T14:20:34  <mleise> yeah it is really cheap :). I used a simple LPT connected LCD once. It was quite nice for some system stats
2011-07-15T14:20:38  <sir_macelon> amstan: it may as well break again, I've seen mcleo commiting some change where he changed to return 2 rows instead of one, don't know why
2011-07-15T14:21:00  <amstan> sir_macelon: right now it's not saying anything
2011-07-15T14:21:02  <amstan> just processing

2011-07-15T14:21:28  <mleise> ok good luck with the ranking page i'm out for a while
2011-07-15T14:21:41  <amstan> sir_macelon: now we wait for the page to load
2011-07-15T14:21:45  <sir_macelon> amstan: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/6b00236f326557905eba8abc3e9da50804cd09f4
2011-07-15T14:22:07  <sir_macelon> line 179 in sql/2_generate_matchup.sql
2011-07-15T14:22:42  <sir_macelon> I am not sure where there should be the 'limit 2', but I don't know the background behind it
2011-07-15T14:22:55  <amstan> sir_macelon: he might have changed the python in another commit
2011-07-15T14:22:56  <sir_macelon> maybe this is the problem
2011-07-15T14:23:03  <amstan> i did a git pull too
2011-07-15T14:23:46  <amstan> hmm
2011-07-15T14:23:50  <amstan> maybe i should restart the server..
2011-07-15T14:24:39  <janzert> my guess is the ranking page problem has something to do with memcache getting jammed somehow
2011-07-15T14:24:40  <sir_macelon> amstan: dunno, do what you think is best
2011-07-15T14:24:57  <janzert> the generate_matchup query shouldn't have anything to do with it
2011-07-15T14:25:13  <amstan> janzert: i think the rankings died because the manager died
2011-07-15T14:25:14  <sir_macelon> <@amstan> well that's why: OperationalError: (1242, 'Subquery returns more than 1 row')
2011-07-15T14:25:16  <sir_macelon> so why amstan has found this error:
2011-07-15T14:25:28  <janzert> that limit 1 to limit 2 change has to do with excluding players from the previous 2 games instead of just the last one
2011-07-15T14:26:04  <sir_macelon> janzert: okay then you should check where did that error came from
2011-07-15T14:26:07  <janzert> amstan: that could be, the memcache was just a guess of mine that I haven't looked into at all
2011-07-15T14:26:25  <mcstar> as far as im concerned, im perfectly ok with not seeing my shitty bot
2011-07-15T14:26:27  <sir_macelon> seems to be written there in the logs
2011-07-15T14:26:47  <janzert> sir_macelon: that error should be tracked down but the manager never even calls that matchup query
2011-07-15T14:26:55  <janzert> that is done from php code
2011-07-15T14:27:27  <janzert> just trying to stop amstan from going down a blind alley in tracking the error down
2011-07-15T14:27:30  <sir_macelon> janzert: as I said, I don't know the impl details, just guessing to help
2011-07-15T14:28:11  <amstan> now.. how did mcleopold start a screen session as contest? sudo su contest then screen doesn't like me
2011-07-15T14:28:18  <janzert> amstan: we need to figure out what to do about a contest email address
2011-07-15T14:28:19  <amstan> is there a way to pass a screen session to another user or something?
2011-07-15T14:28:29  <mcstar> -S
2011-07-15T14:28:37  <amstan> janzert: you have to ask jeff about that, i have no control over the emails
2011-07-15T14:28:40  <sir_macelon> seems the rankings page is back up
2011-07-15T14:28:46  <amstan> mcstar: -S is just for naming, right?
2011-07-15T14:29:02  <sir_macelon> janzert: can't you use the same mail sending as for pw?
2011-07-15T14:29:05  <mcstar> ah yeah
2011-07-15T14:29:18  <mcstar> yo have to start it as that user
2011-07-15T14:29:26  <janzert> sir_macelon: we had many problems with email sending in pw
2011-07-15T14:29:35  <amstan> mcstar: i can't though, because i cannot login as contest unless i sudo su contest
2011-07-15T14:29:47  <janzert> amstan: I was wondering about maybe starting a google group the admins could be subscribed to
2011-07-15T14:29:48  <mcstar> why is that not good?
2011-07-15T14:30:13  <janzert> amstan: chmod your pts to go=rw before sudo su to contest
2011-07-15T14:30:32  <amstan> janzert: is that safe?
2011-07-15T14:30:36  <mcstar> janzert: tell me about that, why?
2011-07-15T14:31:00  <mcstar> amstan: you later want to access contest's screen? is that it?
2011-07-15T14:31:04  <janzert> amstan: depends on your definition of safe ;)

2011-07-15T14:31:28  <janzert> it allows other users on the machine to hijack your console yes, but that is what you want screen to do in this case
2011-07-15T14:31:48  <mcstar> thx, for teaching me this :)
2011-07-15T14:32:10  <janzert> specifically use who to find out your pts then "chmod go=rw /dev/pts/<your pts number>"

2011-07-15T14:41:05  <amstan> mcstar: rankings were always slow
2011-07-15T14:41:05  <sir_macelon> mcstar: we have a very similar word for this in polish, maybe in hungarian it is different
2011-07-15T14:41:17  <mcstar> does it have to do with the more and more players participating?
2011-07-15T14:41:36  <amstan> mcstar: of course..
2011-07-15T14:41:56  <amstan> 20 people should have been enough for beta testing
2011-07-15T14:42:09  <mcstar> youve got a bit more lol
2011-07-15T14:42:25  <amstan> also.. it's really killing the server to run the worker
2011-07-15T14:42:30  <amstan> janzert: do we have a solution for that?
2011-07-15T14:42:31  <janzert> The last two columns look to me like they may require a query/queries over the whole table of games.
2011-07-15T14:42:45  <janzert> don't run the worker on the server?
2011-07-15T14:42:55  <amstan> janzert: they have to run somewhere..
2011-07-15T14:43:01  <janzert> on worker servers
2011-07-15T14:43:03  <sir_macelon> amstan: maybe you could close some accounts that haven't been accessed for a longer time?
2011-07-15T14:43:08  <amstan> yes, but they're always off
2011-07-15T14:43:15  <amstan> janzert: could i manager them or something?
2011-07-15T14:43:38  <janzert> ? they've been up without any downtime at all for almost if not all week
2011-07-15T14:43:47  <amstan> janzert: oh.. ok
2011-07-15T14:43:56  <janzert> amstan: yeah, you do have access through the ai-contest.com server
2011-07-15T14:44:13  <amstan> but if they go down, i don't have any way to get their ips, right?
2011-07-15T14:44:19  <janzert> sure you do
2011-07-15T14:44:50  <amstan> weren't you saying that i have to go in the worker table and get their ip from there?

2011-07-15T14:45:18  <janzert> either through the beta server database (which won't tell you if the actual server is still running though) or through doing an ec2-describe-instances command on ai-contest.com
2011-07-15T14:45:55  <janzert> the former is probably slightly easier to do, but doesn't tell you if ec2 took the servers down of course

2011-07-15T14:47:24  <amstan> janzert: you were also saying something about they keys..
2011-07-15T14:47:29  <amstan> that i had the old keys or something
2011-07-15T14:48:25  <janzert> the correct ssh key is at /home/contest/workerkey on ai-contest.com
2011-07-15T14:49:37  <janzert> to run ec2 commands against jeff's account in order to control or query the worker instances, su to contest then cd /home/contest/ec2-check and run ./ec2-env.sh
2011-07-15T14:49:46  <amstan> janzert: so this should work? ssh -i workerkey ec2-72-44-43-134.compute-1.amazonaws.com
2011-07-15T14:49:59  <amstan> i still get Permission denied (publickey).

2011-07-15T14:51:53  <janzert> i.e. add the ubuntu username
2011-07-15T14:52:37  <amstan> is it supposed to take this long to ssh?
2011-07-15T14:52:41  <amstan> oh, nvm
2011-07-15T14:52:48  <amstan> got it, probably just reverse dns looking
2011-07-15T14:52:59  <janzert> something's really eating cpu
2011-07-15T14:53:04  <janzert> or was until just a second ago
2011-07-15T14:53:09  <amstan> nope, it's all 0
2011-07-15T14:53:20  <janzert> wasn't until a second ago ;)
2011-07-15T14:53:32  <amstan> janzert: keep in mind that i did reboot the server 20 min ago
2011-07-15T14:53:50  <janzert> ok, yeah looks like the workers died with that
2011-07-15T14:54:25  <amstan> why does the manager just quit on exception? same with the worker
2011-07-15T14:54:29  <amstan> they should continue doing stuff
2011-07-15T14:54:43  <amstan> janzert: anyway.. in case the worker process dies, how do i restart it?
2011-07-15T14:54:47  <janzert> McLeopold changed that a few weeks ago and it is a major pain
2011-07-15T14:55:24  <janzert> create a contest user screen session and run worker -t -n 0
2011-07-15T14:56:54  <amstan> janzert: wasn't there supposed to be a screen already running?
2011-07-15T14:57:00  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-15T14:57:03  <janzert> a fresh instance will run the worker script directly so there won't be a screen
2011-07-15T14:57:14  <janzert> I have been thinking about changing that
2011-07-15T14:57:26  <amstan> yes, that would be helpful
2011-07-15T14:57:42  <amstan> also a thing in bashrc for the ubuntu user to automatically attach to that screen
2011-07-15T14:58:02  <janzert> I don't think I'd want that
2011-07-15T14:58:24  <amstan> janzert: how about running a screen as ubuntu, then sudo su to contest inside it
2011-07-15T14:58:33  <amstan> it'll save us the trouble of chmodding ptys
2011-07-15T14:59:15  <janzert> well the startup scripts run as the contest user
2011-07-15T14:59:33  <amstan> no.. i mean till then
2011-07-15T14:59:50  <janzert> ?
2011-07-15T15:00:23  <amstan> till you make the change where the startup script makes a screen... when we need to start the screen manually we just start it as ubuntu, then sudo su contest inside it
2011-07-15T15:00:38  <janzert> I mean the scripts that run at server boot to start everything else, the installation runs as root and the boot scripts run as contest
2011-07-15T15:00:48  <janzert> ahh
2011-07-15T15:01:10  <janzert> we could, it shouldn't really matter
2011-07-15T15:01:26  <janzert> feel free to do it that way
2011-07-15T15:01:32  <amstan> janzert: just saying.. if you have to login, just screen -r on ububuntu
2011-07-15T15:01:40  <amstan> ubuntu*
2011-07-15T15:01:56  <janzert> yeah, it's simpler I suppose :)
2011-07-15T15:03:25  <amstan> k.. started the other workers
2011-07-15T15:05:00  <janzert> anyway I've been getting ready to implement the confirmation emails, but I need a valid from address to send through amazon. I could just use my own email for now during beta, but what do you think of creating a google groups list for admins only to use for it (this could also be used as a contact email on the web page).
2011-07-15T15:05:16  <janzert> heh, I think we've got two worker scripts running on both servers now
2011-07-15T15:05:44  <amstan> janzert: you sure? they were both 0%ing when i logged in
2011-07-15T15:06:01  <janzert> look at htop
2011-07-15T15:06:17  <janzert> or ps -Af | grep worker
2011-07-15T15:06:31  <janzert> ps -Af | grep screen too
2011-07-15T15:06:36  <amstan> which one? .23?
2011-07-15T15:07:12  <janzert> err, ps -Af | grep SCREEN
2011-07-15T15:07:19  <janzert> which on what?
2011-07-15T15:07:23  <janzert> one even
2011-07-15T15:07:41  <amstan> i'm on ip-10-218-37-61
2011-07-15T15:07:50  <amstan> there's 2 SCREENs
2011-07-15T15:07:52  <janzert> both worker instances
2011-07-15T15:07:57  <amstan> one's as contest, i think i forgot to remove that one
2011-07-15T15:08:01  <janzert> right the contest one I started
2011-07-15T15:08:10  <janzert> the ubuntu one you started :)
2011-07-15T15:08:15  <janzert> I'll go ahead and kill mine
2011-07-15T15:09:23  <janzert> hmm, I think you just killed yours as well
2011-07-15T15:09:32  <amstan> nope, i have it open now
2011-07-15T15:09:36  <janzert> at least on the one worker
2011-07-15T15:10:08  <amstan> janzert: you might want to disable the reverse dns lookup for the ssh
2011-07-15T15:10:12  <amstan> it makes ssh logins very very slow
2011-07-15T15:10:53  <janzert> meh, shouldn't be logging in much anyway ;)
2011-07-15T15:11:54  <janzert> actually it doesn't usually take long to login, I'm not really sure why it was so slow just now
2011-07-15T15:12:02  <amstan> it is always slow for me
2011-07-15T15:12:05  <amstan> like 10 seconds or more
2011-07-15T15:12:16  <janzert> hmm, weird
2011-07-15T15:12:25  <mcstar> i had the same issue with ubuntu at work
2011-07-15T15:12:25  <amstan> i do this on all my hosts
2011-07-15T15:12:31  <janzert> certainly generally under 5 for me
2011-07-15T15:12:38  <mcstar> i dont remember that it would solve it though
2011-07-15T15:12:45  <amstan> the only reason the dns lookup is enabled is for the auth log
2011-07-15T15:12:55  <amstan> mcstar: http://www.yaleman.org/2007/12/09/ssh-reverse-dns-lookup-disable/
2011-07-15T15:13:16  <mcstar> i kind of remember that i changed sshd.conf, but it didnt solve it
2011-07-15T15:13:35  <janzert> amstan: yep, and I rather like having the audit trail
2011-07-15T15:13:56  <mcstar> UseDNS no, ok i didnt change this maybe, thx :)
2011-07-15T15:13:57  <amstan> k
2011-07-15T15:14:27  <janzert> but if it's too much of a pain for you, I'm not that opposed to changing it either
2011-07-15T15:15:43  <janzert> anyway any thoughts on the admin mailing list to use for a contest contact email?
2011-07-15T15:16:17  <amstan> janzert: we already have google apps for your domain, we can make a pseudo address there that forwards stuff to all of us
2011-07-15T15:17:32  <janzert> that might work fine, the only advantage of an actual list I was thinking of was that when someone replied they could "reply to all" and then everyone else could see that a response had been sent
2011-07-15T15:17:52  <amstan> it works the same as a list
2011-07-15T15:18:09  <amstan> and it'll have a @ai-contest.com prefix
2011-07-15T15:18:12  <janzert> without the archives though I imagine?
2011-07-15T15:18:21  <amstan> yes, without the archives
2011-07-15T15:18:28  <amstan> but we already have our inboxes for that
2011-07-15T15:18:40  <janzert> we could of course use an @ai-contest.com email and have it forward to an actual list as well
2011-07-15T15:19:00  <janzert> so long as you don't throw 'em out, but sure
2011-07-15T15:19:36  <amstan> idk.. most people that email are really stressed out about their bots/passwords/accounts
2011-07-15T15:19:47  <amstan> idk if that kind of mails are worth archiving anyway
2011-07-15T15:21:21  <amstan> janzert: so.. what are you thinking? contact@ai-contest.com?
2011-07-15T15:21:59  <janzert> or admin@ai-contest.com were the two choices I had thought of
2011-07-15T15:23:04  <janzert> haven't put much thought into it though ;)
2011-07-15T15:27:12  <mcstar> a better solution is a helpdesk: have somebody assigned to taking skype calls
2011-07-15T15:27:42  <janzert> if you'll man it :P
2011-07-15T15:27:47  <mcstar> hehe
2011-07-15T15:27:58  <janzert> we still need an email address though
2011-07-15T15:28:21  <amstan> janzert: i pinged jeff about it, so it'll take a while
2011-07-15T15:28:30  <janzert> amstan: sounds good

2011-07-15T16:59:03  <bhasker_> wtf http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=87026&user=13
2011-07-15T16:59:13  <bhasker_> how is it that that i lose this game?
2011-07-15T16:59:20  <bhasker_> how come my score is lower the cyan's
2011-07-15T16:59:49  <bhasker_> this scoring model seems broken
2011-07-15T17:12:56  <sir_macelon> bhasker_ that is great news for me,  I don't see anything broken here, perfect exapmle for a rewarding win for fighting bot
2011-07-15T17:13:06  <bhasker_> but it lost...
2011-07-15T17:13:09  <bhasker_> he had 6 ants
2011-07-15T17:13:12  <bhasker_> i had 99% of the map
2011-07-15T17:13:17  <bhasker_> makes no sense?
2011-07-15T17:13:38  <bhasker_> how can he win when he clearly lost
2011-07-15T17:13:41  <sir_macelon> that's another story, if you would have killed it, you'd get the bonus
2011-07-15T17:13:56  <bhasker_> irrespective of the bonus
2011-07-15T17:14:01  <bhasker_> with such a large differential
2011-07-15T17:14:05  <bhasker_> i should have won
2011-07-15T17:14:22  <bhasker_> i can agree if we were close then him winning makes sense
2011-07-15T17:14:24  <sir_macelon> well yes indeed, the cutoff should be based on scores not on ants
2011-07-15T17:14:33  <sir_macelon> i've already stated that many times
2011-07-15T17:15:01  <bhasker_> as in the game should cutoff when the score difference remains stable?
2011-07-15T17:15:38  <sir_macelon> it should work just like for the ant counts now
2011-07-15T17:15:51  <sir_macelon> 66% advantage over 150 turns
2011-07-15T17:16:02  <sir_macelon> that's my opinion
2011-07-15T17:17:56  <CIA-48> aichallenge: janzert epsilon * r1e16bd6 / (4 files in 2 dirs): Get email confirmations working - http://bit.ly/mZlKBf
2011-07-15T17:18:48  <sir_macelon> bhasker_: but you should keep in mind, if game turn limit would be around 500, you wouldn't have won anyway
2011-07-15T17:19:29  <bhasker_> that is not the point here though right? we are talking about the current game limit
2011-07-15T17:19:45  <bhasker_> if/when we fix to a certain turn number one can optimize for that limit
2011-07-15T17:20:22  <bhasker_> i can conversely argue that if it was maybe 1600 i would have eventually wiped him out
2011-07-15T17:20:23  <bhasker_> and won
2011-07-15T17:23:05  <sir_macelon> not a point, but a side note
2011-07-15T17:23:22  <sir_macelon> but you are right, you should have won that game
2011-07-15T17:23:40  <sir_macelon> the cutoff is not fair sometimes
2011-07-15T17:27:57  <bhasker_> the problem is not the cutoff
2011-07-15T17:28:10  <bhasker_> the problem is how we are scoring

2011-07-15T20:54:23  <jmcarthur> personally i kind of agree. the scoring is shit
2011-07-15T20:56:43  <jmcarthur> i think we should have ant hills. you start with a hill, which has an ant on it, then as you eat more food ants spawn at your hill (one at a time, as you move ants off of it). we wouldn't even have to change the bot I/O protocol. you can just assume that your first ant marks the location of the hill and that eating food queues up ants to spawn from your hill
2011-07-15T20:57:10  <jmcarthur> this differs from the earlier ants game with hills in that you don't have to actually take food back to your hill (which i think slows things down too much)
2011-07-15T20:57:33  <jmcarthur> and of course also that combat is completely different (no hp, etc.)
2011-07-15T20:57:48  <jmcarthur> this would replace the scoring entirely. if you lose your hill, you lose
2011-07-15T20:58:10  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-07-15T20:58:26  <jmcarthur> the protocol might need to be changed slightly to tell you where opponents' hill are, i guess
2011-07-15T20:58:35  <jmcarthur> *hills
2011-07-15T21:00:24  <jmcarthur> the effect of this would be that expansion would initially be much slower (aside from sending out scouts i guess), yet there would be a tradeoff between defending your hill and getting more ants. then there would be some fairly big clusters of ants and some big fights, and then whoever managed the defense/offense/expansion balance best would win

2011-07-15T22:11:44  <janzert> jmcarthur: I rather like that game better than what we have; and scoring is purely by order of getting your hill taken over I assume?

2011-07-15T22:39:16  <antimatroid> i agree with janzert
2011-07-15T22:39:29  <antimatroid> i much prefer it, but i'm not sure about changing it, no change in protocol is good though
2011-07-15T22:40:26  <antimatroid> i would consider still having a scoring system like now, but giving people big points if they take out one players base, like wipe that players ants off the map and give the invading bot the number of points as the enemy bot had ants or whatever (plus say 20 for the base?)
2011-07-15T23:06:26  <jmcarthur> i think i'd rather make a major change, even now
2011-07-15T23:06:54  <jmcarthur> i'm not really happy with the game as it is :\
2011-07-15T23:07:32  <jmcarthur> but i'm not rushing to volunteer to make such a change, so i guess i don't really have much say it it, deservedly

2011-07-15T23:20:13  <antimatroid> yeah, we're stretched pretty thin on people left with time to do things and willing
2011-07-15T23:26:30  <janzert> one big advantage to me of going to hill capture would be getting rid of all indirect scoring, without that it's rather less appealing
2011-07-15T23:32:49  <antimatroid> so we would just score it based on the order of people being removed from the game?
2011-07-15T23:33:02  <antimatroid> would you take out a bots ants if their base is invade, or just stop them from spawning more ants?
2011-07-15T23:33:19  <janzert> remove them from the game
2011-07-15T23:33:38  <antimatroid> i think it would make the game much more interesting
2011-07-15T23:34:09  <antimatroid> spawning would need to be able to "back up" for when people collected more than one food item per turn
2011-07-15T23:34:50  <antimatroid> would ant hills block movement from friend ants? and would enemy ants invade by killing it like another ant or successfully residing on the ant hill after battle resolution?
2011-07-15T23:35:03  <janzert> right, jmcarthur said that in his first message on it ;)
2011-07-15T23:35:24  <janzert> I would say they don't block movement
2011-07-15T23:35:58  <janzert> I was thinking just having an enemy ant occupy the hill square at the end of a turn is what kills it
2011-07-15T23:36:32  <antimatroid> yep i agree
2011-07-15T23:36:33  <janzert> it would require an addition to the protocol in case you missed that earlier
2011-07-15T23:36:59  <antimatroid> what specifically?
2011-07-15T23:37:07  <antimatroid> a few minor things like scores would disappear
2011-07-15T23:37:18  <janzert> the engine would have to tell the bot about it when a hill first came into view
2011-07-15T23:37:25  <antimatroid> ah yes
2011-07-15T23:37:51  <antimatroid> i don't think adding/removing is so much a problem as changing the current protocol
2011-07-15T23:37:53  <janzert> the biggest changes required though are probably to the visualizer :(
2011-07-15T23:38:07  <antimatroid> provided the bots that are currently written only need minor adjustments i think it could be somewhat feasible
2011-07-15T23:38:28  <janzert> the protocol change is minor enough that I don't have a problem with it
2011-07-15T23:38:39  <antimatroid> i don't think it would be too much work for frontier to add an ant hill type thing on each location?
2011-07-15T23:38:50  <antimatroid> he would need to agree of course
2011-07-15T23:38:56  <antimatroid> just trying to think of what he'd need to do
2011-07-15T23:39:01  <janzert> well, the whole goal of the game changes so the current bots will need to change a lot more than just the way they handle the protocol
2011-07-15T23:39:18  <janzert> all the scoring stuff needs to go away in the visualizer
2011-07-15T23:39:27  <antimatroid> ah yeah
2011-07-15T23:39:34  <antimatroid> hmmmm
2011-07-15T23:40:03  <antimatroid> so strip the score bar, keep #ants, and add visualisation of ant hills?
2011-07-15T23:40:25  <janzert> I think changing the actual protocol parsing is extremely minor compared to changing the strategies, spawning behavior, etc
2011-07-15T23:40:27  <antimatroid> i will see what he thinks later, i wouldn't be surprised if he (understandably) doesn't want to
2011-07-15T23:41:13  <antimatroid> i would get my future cop lapd feature back :D
2011-07-15T23:41:51  <janzert> one advantage of making such a major change in the game play at this stage is people can't complain so much about beta testers getting such an advantage ;)
2011-07-15T23:43:21  <antimatroid> yep
2011-07-15T23:43:32  <antimatroid> and it adds some spice to the people who have already been working on it
2011-07-15T23:43:59  <antimatroid> i think i'm for it if mcleopold and frontier are
2011-07-15T23:44:37  <antimatroid> i
2011-07-15T23:45:02  <antimatroid> i'd be a little worried about people's ability to get to the base if a bot decides to just occupy the closest squares to it's base with the current battle option?
2011-07-15T23:45:43  <antimatroid> with a more goal oriented game i think we might be able to get away with less flooded maps though? but yeah, i'm just speculating now
