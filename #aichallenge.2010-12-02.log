2010-12-02T00:00:03  <antimatroid> it adds some kind of structure to it that simplifies things
2010-12-02T00:00:21  <burny> same here anti
2010-12-02T00:00:23  <antimatroid> although i'm not quite sure about n-player zero sum games
2010-12-02T00:00:33  <jmcarthur> n-player zero sum is hard, i know
2010-12-02T00:00:53  <antimatroid> i have a game theory library i'm making to solve for different refinements in different game classes
2010-12-02T00:01:08  <burny> cool
2010-12-02T00:01:13  <antimatroid> i pulled sections of that out for my simultaneous bot in this
2010-12-02T00:01:47  <burny> nice, your bot did quite well, considering it's frequency of fail plays
2010-12-02T00:01:47  <davidjliu> woah, some intense discussion going on
2010-12-02T00:02:31  <jmcarthur> always
2010-12-02T00:02:44  <sigh> everyone is wrong!
2010-12-02T00:02:47  <virdo> I keep rereading that solved game wiki page... I still don't see how the "outcome can be correctly predicted from any position when each side plays optimally" -- it cannot be predicted in RPS situations... I'm not sure how we can even dispute this, given it's the definition of a "solved game"?
2010-12-02T00:02:55  <antimatroid> burny: the tree i uploaded was so broken it's hilarious how well it did :P
2010-12-02T00:03:14  <sigh> virdo: that's what happens when you read one sentence and treat it as gospel
2010-12-02T00:03:22  <burny> virdo.. rps IS the prediction
2010-12-02T00:03:29  <antimatroid> the sentence is fine
2010-12-02T00:03:39  <virdo> sigh: you'
2010-12-02T00:03:46  <sigh> yes ?
2010-12-02T00:03:59  <antimatroid> virdo: consider a game of rock paper scissors, both players playing optimally is both players saying they will choose any optinion with equal probability
2010-12-02T00:04:01  <virdo> enter got pressed on the quote sign - ;)
2010-12-02T00:04:09  <antimatroid> then when the game runs, they use some random process to pick the move they play
2010-12-02T00:04:20  <antimatroid> you don't necessarily win or draw, but that is the optimal thing you can do
2010-12-02T00:04:26  <antimatroid> that is classified as "solved"
2010-12-02T00:04:32  <virdo> I'm not disputing the players playing optimally... just if a game is solvable...
2010-12-02T00:04:54  <jmcarthur> virdo: did you read up on mixed strategies yet?
2010-12-02T00:04:58  <antimatroid> my point is that that's the solution
2010-12-02T00:05:05  <burny> virdo, take tic-tac-toe for exmaple..
2010-12-02T00:05:10  <burny> that game is clearly solved..
2010-12-02T00:05:15  <sigh> the argument is that finding the optimal play *is* solving the game
2010-12-02T00:05:17  <burny> but can you tell me what move I'm going to make first?
2010-12-02T00:05:21  <jmcarthur> virdo: the game is solved when you have found the optimal strategy. it doesn't matter if the optimal strategy always wins
2010-12-02T00:05:26  <virdo> burny: tic tac toe doesn't have RPS...
2010-12-02T00:06:00  <sigh> virdo: what distintion do you make between optimal play and solving the game?
2010-12-02T00:06:02  <jmcarthur> virdo: and "outcome" in the quote you keep citing is "expected outcome over many games"
2010-12-02T00:06:03  <antimatroid> burny: bottom left
2010-12-02T00:06:07  <virdo> jmcarthur: how can you predict the outcome if there is a RPS situation? that's teh whole idea of this right?
2010-12-02T00:06:12  <jmcarthur> ^^
2010-12-02T00:06:23  <burny> virdo, RPS _IS_ the outcome
2010-12-02T00:06:26  <antimatroid> virdo: expected payoffs :)
2010-12-02T00:06:32  <sigh> jmcarthur: expected outcome of one game, if you are n the bayesian camp
2010-12-02T00:06:35  <sigh> :P
2010-12-02T00:07:08  <jmcarthur> sigh: heh
2010-12-02T00:07:11  <virdo> guys, there is a reason why RPS isn't part of the "solved games".. and no, I didn't remove it... assume two optimal players of RPS... go ahead, predict the outcome...
2010-12-02T00:07:23  <virdo> am I that dense? :(
2010-12-02T00:07:26  <burny> if rock beats everythign except for rock and paper.. and scissors beats everything except scissors and rock.. etc.

2010-12-02T00:07:41  <sigh> virdo: yes, I can give you a prediction of the expected outcome
2010-12-02T00:07:42  <jmcarthur> virdo: the expected outcome of RPS is that you win 50% of the time
2010-12-02T00:07:45  <antimatroid> dense in what?
2010-12-02T00:08:11  <virdo> sigh: what is your prediction?
2010-12-02T00:08:12  <burny> then that means, you can choose one of those 3 plays.. and have an at-worst, 33% chance of losing
2010-12-02T00:08:17  <sigh> you aren't dense, it's just that you are trying to approach this with no background knowledge
2010-12-02T00:08:24  <sigh> virdo: what jmcarthur said
2010-12-02T00:08:27  <burny> and then: if you opponent does NOT play one of those 3 strategys..
2010-12-02T00:08:30  <burny> you punish them, and win
2010-12-02T00:08:44  <jmcarthur> burny: are you talking about iterated games?
2010-12-02T00:08:59  <jmcarthur> actually, where did that 33% come from?
2010-12-02T00:09:04  <burny> jmcarthur, no.. I'm tlaking about an RPS situation, in a NON RPS game
2010-12-02T00:09:08  <jmcarthur> oh
2010-12-02T00:09:14  <burny> eg. planet wars
2010-12-02T00:09:17  <jmcarthur> okay
2010-12-02T00:09:38  <burny> if a map is RPS between.. attack near planet > waiting > attacing far planet..
2010-12-02T00:09:46  <burny> and your opponent is not aware of this
2010-12-02T00:10:08  <burny> then one of those 3 plays, will be more likely to win than others
2010-12-02T00:10:17  <sigh> virdo: the simple fact is that people have already thought about the issues that you brought up and have *generalised* the definition so that it works for games like rps
2010-12-02T00:10:42  <sigh> the problem is that you are refusing to consider that the definition can be generalised
2010-12-02T00:11:08  <virdo> nope, no longer do I refuse it... trying to read up as much on it in the background as I can... and I stand corrected :)
2010-12-02T00:11:26  <sigh> :)
2010-12-02T00:14:57  <antimatroid> virdo: let's break rps down, each player has the action sets {R, P, S}, {r, p, s} a mixed strategy over a players set is just something like (1/3,1/3,1/3) saying how likely you are to play each strategy, the pure strategy space is the Cartesian product of these {(R,r),..., (P, p)}, and the mixed strategy space is the Cartian product of all possible mixed strategies (note that set is infinite)
2010-12-02T00:14:58  <antimatroid> you are thinking a solution to the game is an element of the pure strategy space, where u(x,y) is an element of your payoff matrix, but what we're saying is a and b can be from the mixed strategy space and you then define eu(a,b) = sum   p(x,y).u(x,y)
2010-12-02T00:15:04  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if that'll help or hurt, :P
2010-12-02T00:15:56  <antimatroid> ah, i was late anyway :)
2010-12-02T00:21:54  <antimatroid> while the game wouldn't be easy, an ai contest with a differential game would be cool
2010-12-02T00:22:14  <antimatroid> differential games is like multiplayer optimal control theory
2010-12-02T00:23:18  <virdo> holy crap, it hit me (while reading wiki page for differential game and getting to the part of "a pursuer and an evader") -- team based capture the flag :P

2010-12-02T00:37:43  <jmcarthur> i think it's a joke. yegge has said before that haskell is in his top ten favorite languages or some crap like that
2010-12-02T00:37:52  <jmcarthur> according to a comment i read earlier today at least
2010-12-02T00:39:00  <burny> a multiplayer cross between dodgeball and tag could be cool
2010-12-02T00:39:19  <jmcarthur> i was kinda thinking ultimate frisbee could be neat if done right
2010-12-02T00:39:42  <sigh> jmcarthur: are we still talking about AI? o_O
2010-12-02T00:39:47  <burny> which is semi similar to soccer?
2010-12-02T00:39:57  <jmcarthur> well, you can't move while you're holding the frisbee
2010-12-02T00:40:27  <jmcarthur> and you can't steal it

2010-12-02T00:40:49  <antimatroid> with team based, i think it might almost be better to do 2 players per match, but each player has multiple communicating bots
2010-12-02T00:40:51  <burny> the problem with AI and that..
2010-12-02T00:41:02  <antimatroid> otherwise ranking gets insane
2010-12-02T00:41:08  <burny> is the best strategy, is for everyone on the team to stand still, so they can aim he throw well
2010-12-02T00:41:31  <antimatroid> i disagree
2010-12-02T00:41:33  <burny> I think mixing the bots together is way more interesting
2010-12-02T00:41:39  <antimatroid> they'd just go in and block all your paths
2010-12-02T00:41:56  <burny> oh, if you can't throw in the air, ya..
2010-12-02T00:42:09  <burny> then it's liek soccer, if it can't go in the air
2010-12-02T00:42:15  <antimatroid> hmmm yeah
2010-12-02T00:42:27  <antimatroid> wait not really
2010-12-02T00:42:31  <antimatroid> soccer can go in the air too
2010-12-02T00:42:35  <antimatroid> and frisbee can go low
2010-12-02T00:42:38  <burny> I think a simple RTS could be a neat idea though
2010-12-02T00:42:40  <antimatroid> it's the goal state
2010-12-02T00:42:52  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm out for a while
2010-12-02T00:42:58  <burny> like, each player starts with a base.. and each abse makes some unit, after X time
2010-12-02T00:43:09  <burny> and there's 3 or so different units
2010-12-02T00:43:39  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.84.57> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-02T00:44:54  <burny> but like planetwars, there should be some sort of neutral parties, that give units less often, or some such
2010-12-02T00:45:21  <burny> I think it'd be too much processing though, to make the game be interesting
2010-12-02T00:46:07  <burny> the whole thing that makes rts's interesting generally(for simialrly skileld players), is the paper/rock/scissors combination with reaction time
2010-12-02T00:47:39  <antimatroid> why not just do the starcraft tournament for rta?
2010-12-02T00:47:42  <antimatroid> rts*
2010-12-02T00:47:55  <burny> hm, what about car racing? have some randomness in it, so you can't mathematically predict the 'perfect' speed/turn rate, etc.
2010-12-02T00:48:25  <sigh> burny: antimatroid wanted mario kart
2010-12-02T00:48:50  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3765), _iouri_(3565), Slin-.-(3524), _Astek_(3501), jimrogerz(3500), Accoun(3498), george(3494), GreenTea(3489), asavis(3480), bix0r4ever(3476)
2010-12-02T00:49:27  <burny> I think car racing would be too simple(or hard) likely though
2010-12-02T00:51:02  <antimatroid> mario cart is cool because of the weapons

2010-12-02T03:45:35  <sigh> ah ok, sorry :)
2010-12-02T03:45:54  <Epona> boc said it was the basis of his one in the tron contest
2010-12-02T03:45:59  <Epona> although it failed
2010-12-02T03:46:13  <sigh> he got 11th in tron which is hardly failing, I think :P
2010-12-02T03:47:01  <Epona> its not 1st
2010-12-02T03:47:07  <sigh> :)
2010-12-02T03:47:13  <sigh> mega1: speaking of which, have you ever written a Go bot?
2010-12-02T03:47:50  *** nullkuhl <nullkuhl!~zero@196.221.228.108> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-12-02T03:48:29  <antimatroid> he didn't submit his uct bot for tron
2010-12-02T03:48:45  <mega1> sigh: no, I shopped for something with simpler rules and ended up with hex.
2010-12-02T03:48:58  <antimatroid> hex does seem fun
2010-12-02T03:49:10  <mega1> it is a good game for humans
2010-12-02T03:49:14  <sigh> mega1: fair enough :)
2010-12-02T03:49:43  <sigh> I wouldn't know where to start writing a go bot even starting with UCT :P
2010-12-02T03:50:37  <Epona> is UCT superior?
2010-12-02T03:51:38  <sigh> superior to what?
2010-12-02T03:52:01  <sigh> in something like Go, it is superior to minimax, because the branching factor is simply too large for minimax
2010-12-02T03:52:14  <Epona> im just trying to find the best algorithms to learn
2010-12-02T03:52:35  <sigh> what is your current background?
2010-12-02T03:52:38  <sigh> what do you know already>
2010-12-02T03:52:45  <antimatroid> start with minimax with alpha beta search if you haven't implemented that before
2010-12-02T03:52:54  <sigh> yes, this ^^
2010-12-02T03:53:32  <Epona> alright
2010-12-02T03:53:38  <Epona> ive been working with python'
2010-12-02T03:53:48  <antimatroid> that's fine
2010-12-02T03:54:01  <sigh> have you studied algorithms at all?
2010-12-02T03:54:21  <antimatroid> i don't think you really even need algorithms for minimax, it's that easy
2010-12-02T03:54:51  <Epona> djkstras algorithm, the napsack problem, neural nets, algebra, trig
2010-12-02T03:55:00  <sigh> then you should be fine with minimax
2010-12-02T03:55:27  <antimatroid> Epona: it would be easy to make one for tron
2010-12-02T03:55:42  <antimatroid> and all the starter packs/engines etc. are available online
2010-12-02T03:55:50  <sigh> don't try to implement minimax for planetwars ;)
2010-12-02T03:56:03  <sigh> at least, not as your first project, that will scar you :P
2010-12-02T03:56:08  <antimatroid> it's possibly, but you need to do a hell of a lot of pruning if you want to make many moves
2010-12-02T03:56:14  <antimatroid> possible*
2010-12-02T03:56:33  <Epona> ive been building my own algorithms
2010-12-02T03:56:40  <Epona> its pretty fun :)
2010-12-02T03:56:45  <sigh> :)

2010-12-02T03:57:14  <antimatroid> nah, projects are great for learning

2010-12-02T04:04:02  <sigh> literate
2010-12-02T04:04:10  <Epona> like how its taught in school
2010-12-02T04:04:29  <antimatroid> what is taught? sorry i'm lost now
2010-12-02T04:04:54  <antimatroid> i wish relations etc. were taught in middle school
2010-12-02T04:05:02  <antimatroid> and well, just proper maths in general
2010-12-02T04:05:15  <Epona> http://www.wolframalpha.com/ is the kind of math organization im talking about
2010-12-02T04:05:58  <antimatroid> i'm just going off what i've read on the net, but apparently wolfram is a dick
2010-12-02T04:06:31  <sigh> that's the general consensus :P
2010-12-02T04:06:46  <antimatroid> then again, i'm an arrogant little prick to people sometimes :P
2010-12-02T04:06:51  <Epona> Im not sure how you came to that
2010-12-02T04:06:58  <antimatroid> possibly remove that sometimes part too
2010-12-02T04:09:40  <Epona> FAIL
2010-12-02T04:09:42  <Epona> Dissapointingly, there was no learning, adapting to opponent behaviour, etc. All that made it to the todo list, but had to take second seat to more pressing concerns.

2010-12-02T04:20:57  <Epona> well
2010-12-02T04:21:13  <Epona> I found out some proper syntax for a python neural net
2010-12-02T04:21:19  <Epona> if you wanna see it
2010-12-02T04:24:07  <antimatroid> people seem to think neural nets suck
2010-12-02T04:24:18  <antimatroid> i've only ever had a brief introduction to them in a class, and a few worked examples by hand updating input thingys
2010-12-02T04:27:08  <mega1> as is obvious from my blog I'm a big fan of deep learning and boltzmann machines
2010-12-02T04:27:28  <mega1> that's a trendy kind of neural network with probabilistic roots

2010-12-02T04:57:32  <Frontier> mega1: I stumbled across "innovative algorithm" as well. After all with ~200 ELO points in the lead, you come to believe there MUST be an innovation under the hood ;).
2010-12-02T04:58:49  <Frontier> I even thought your bot is deliberately sending fleets forth and back randomly to confuse the enemy ai.

2010-12-02T07:34:06  <Mistmanov> do you think I can get one when I impress them with my awesome FIRST PLACE FINISH FOR THE NETHERLANDS?
2010-12-02T07:34:28  <Mistmanov> second place would've been a total turn-off ofcourse..
2010-12-02T07:34:37  <Error323> I hope she claws your eyes out
2010-12-02T07:34:40  <Error323> xD
2010-12-02T07:34:41  <Mistmanov> that's like
2010-12-02T07:34:47  <Mistmanov> "you tried really hard, but totally failed"
2010-12-02T07:34:52  <Mistmanov> ;)
2010-12-02T07:35:11  <Error323> grmbl grmbl
2010-12-02T07:35:20  <Mistmanov> I seriously had a nightmare that I would wake up to check the rankings, and both of us would've dropped to like 150 :p
2010-12-02T07:35:22  <Error323> :]
2010-12-02T07:35:29  <Error323> hahahhahah
2010-12-02T07:35:53  <Error323> I just needed one more game
2010-12-02T07:35:56  <Error323> one more win
2010-12-02T07:36:05  <Error323> it'll haunt me forever
2010-12-02T07:36:17  <Error323> or well.. till next contest
2010-12-02T07:36:23  <amstan> k.. so what about this contest..
2010-12-02T07:36:24  <Mistmanov> hmhm =)
2010-12-02T07:36:26  <amstan> what shall it be?
2010-12-02T07:36:40  <amstan> who's up for 2d minecraft on infinite sized maps
2010-12-02T07:36:45  <phreeza> ahahahah wtf i'm looking at the other videos
2010-12-02T07:36:48  <amstan> mmorts
2010-12-02T07:37:01  <phreeza> 8bit stick figure porn
2010-12-02T07:37:05  <Error323> well he had some brainstorming on soccer, towerdefense, rts and some kind of liquid game.
2010-12-02T07:37:23  * Error323 doesn't know minecraft
2010-12-02T07:37:37  <Mistmanov> I think an mmo kind of thing would be awesome, but hard to score, and maybe hard to actually make it an interesting problem for bots

2010-12-02T07:47:26  <antimatroid> that game looks quite cool actually
2010-12-02T07:47:52  <amstan> it has hexagons and math..
2010-12-02T07:47:57  <amstan> nobody likes math..
2010-12-02T07:48:20  <antimatroid> "The source code must consist of one single file" deal breaker
2010-12-02T07:48:24  <antimatroid> i'm not doing that, fuck that
2010-12-02T07:48:34  <antimatroid> amstan: i love math :(
2010-12-02T07:48:46  <amstan> you can always merge several of your source files just before submission
2010-12-02T07:48:56  <antimatroid> so much effort
2010-12-02T07:49:05  <sigh> just use #includes
2010-12-02T07:49:18  <amstan> use include guards..
2010-12-02T07:49:27  <amstan> then run gpp on your source files then cat them together
2010-12-02T07:49:53  <amstan> that should work, i think
2010-12-02T07:50:03  <Error323> gpp?
2010-12-02T07:50:14  <sigh> g++

2010-12-02T07:50:57  <amstan> wait.. that won't work... you have to cat them first.. then gpp it
2010-12-02T07:51:11  <amstan> the include guards will make sure you don't have duplicate declarations
2010-12-02T07:51:18  <antimatroid> :P i would just copy them from .h files i think
2010-12-02T07:51:48  <sigh> amstan: why would you need to cat them together if you are running it though the preprocessor

2010-12-02T07:52:16  <amstan> sigh: because those c files will not merge by themselves
2010-12-02T07:52:34  <amstan> unless you do evil stuff like #include <file.c>
2010-12-02T07:52:36  <sigh> they will if you are #including the .cpp files
2010-12-02T07:52:39  <sigh> yes :P
2010-12-02T07:52:55  <amstan> so sketchy..
2010-12-02T07:52:58  <sigh> I actually did that in this contest so that I could have src files in directories :P

2010-12-02T07:56:20  <antimatroid> i liked the idea of people submitting binaries
2010-12-02T07:56:36  <amstan> that too
2010-12-02T07:56:55  <amstan> one thing i don't like about it is that people will be able to submit closed source bots
2010-12-02T07:57:27  <amstan> and that might be a problem if we want to analyze a bot for security reasons
2010-12-02T07:57:39  <amstan> though, i don't think we had to do this yet
2010-12-02T07:58:43  <antimatroid> hmmm, i do think it's important the code can be accessed
2010-12-02T07:58:51  <Error323> and shared afterwards
2010-12-02T07:59:01  <Error323> imo its the most valuable aspect of the contest
2010-12-02T07:59:06  <antimatroid> maybe require people submit source as well, and state that if it's later tested and not the same as the binary, they get kicked
2010-12-02T07:59:40  <antimatroid> although then how do you know if it's the same if it's not determnistic

2010-12-02T08:00:06  <antimatroid> yeah i don't like binaries :P
2010-12-02T08:00:09  <amstan> by using a preset seed
2010-12-02T08:00:20  <amstan> given by the contest
2010-12-02T08:00:32  <Error323> I would much more prefer some I/O space per user
2010-12-02T08:00:52  <sigh> then Accoun will complain that you chose a chiting seed
2010-12-02T08:01:02  <antimatroid> amstan: one thing that is very important next time is very clear upper bounds on parameters
2010-12-02T08:01:11  <antimatroid> i really like the general rules, but i think they need to be a bit more clear
2010-12-02T08:01:19  <amstan> antimatroid: it would be nice to have a json communications protocol
2010-12-02T08:01:35  <amstan> and just include everything in there..
2010-12-02T08:02:00  <amstan> i had this awesome idea for the mmorts... let bots communicate
2010-12-02T08:02:05  <antimatroid> what is the plan at this point with fixing things up anyway?
2010-12-02T08:02:14  <amstan> antimatroid: fixing? define fixing
2010-12-02T08:02:21  <antimatroid> i've said before, but i'm happy to help so far as i can and i don't become ineligible to compete
2010-12-02T08:02:29  <antimatroid> improving*
2010-12-02T08:02:32  <antimatroid> might be a better work
2010-12-02T08:02:45  <amstan> antimatroid: as i said before, unless you get root, it won't matter
2010-12-02T08:03:04  <amstan> we'll probably do a rewrite
2010-12-02T08:03:07  <Error323> clear upper bounds and important changes should always be communicated directly via mail or sth. I stil don't understand why this didn't happen.
2010-12-02T08:03:07  <antimatroid> yeah, so how long do you plan to break for before getting to work on the framework stuff for next contest?
2010-12-02T08:03:20  <amstan> i'll probably start in jan
2010-12-02T08:03:27  <amstan> since i have exams till then

2010-12-02T08:04:01  <antimatroid> that was a very painful few weeks
2010-12-02T08:04:08  <antimatroid> i went through exams with like 3 weeks left in the contest

2010-12-02T08:23:14  <antimatroid> Error323: it wasn't that hard to work out what he was saying most of the time
2010-12-02T08:23:26  <antimatroid> and frankly, i'm willing to let people slip on poor english if it's not their native tongue
2010-12-02T08:23:37  <antimatroid> he as a person I got sick of though
2010-12-02T08:23:39  <Error323> well perhaps for native speakers it was more easy
2010-12-02T08:23:43  <antimatroid> :P
2010-12-02T08:23:47  <antimatroid> that probably helped
2010-12-02T08:23:50  <Error323> but some stuff I just couldn't parse
2010-12-02T08:24:03  <antimatroid> i can't talk, i know no other languages
2010-12-02T08:24:08  <amstan> yeah, that was the problem, i couldn't parse his posts
2010-12-02T08:24:37  <amstan> and if i do, they sometimes don't make sense
2010-12-02T08:24:45  <amstan> like the sentences do, but the thoughts don't
2010-12-02T08:25:14  <amstan> also, what's the obsesion with 100k-1 map count
2010-12-02T08:25:21  <amstan> where k in {4,9}
2010-12-02T08:25:29  <Error323> no idea
2010-12-02T08:25:55  <Error323> whilest i do agree on the more maps being better, i don't know why he wanted that much
2010-12-02T08:26:28  <medrimonia> amstan: It's because 500 maps are less accurate than 499 =P
2010-12-02T08:26:35  <amstan> he also suggested that pairs should play on all maps
2010-12-02T08:27:03  <Error323> he must have known that that's unfeasable
2010-12-02T08:27:04  <amstan> medrimonia: oh man... us chitting organizers introducing that one map..
2010-12-02T08:27:26  <Error323> he was stupid and not stupid at the same time
2010-12-02T08:27:29  <Error323> ^_^
2010-12-02T08:28:53  <sigh> to be fair, people in the channel were fanning the flames quite a bit
2010-12-02T08:29:52  * antimatroid raises his hand
2010-12-02T08:29:53  <Error323> me being one of them i admit
2010-12-02T08:30:06  <antimatroid> i can't help myself, it
2010-12-02T08:30:13  <antimatroid> s fun getting under peoples skin
2010-12-02T08:30:17  <Error323> but after trying normal conversations
2010-12-02T08:30:36  <antimatroid> i did try to be patient with him, i even had a pm convo with him once trying to get him to chill
2010-12-02T08:30:44  <Error323> some stuff was so absurd i seriously thought he was joking
2010-12-02T08:31:13  <sigh> yeah, me too
2010-12-02T08:31:27  <sigh> then I thought he was just trolling
2010-12-02T08:31:38  <antimatroid> then he just kept going D:

2010-12-02T11:53:36  <a1k0n_> evidently
2010-12-02T11:54:00  <a1k0n_> his lead was much more decisive.
2010-12-02T11:54:19  <a1k0n_> mine was pretty last-minute
2010-12-02T11:54:44  <mega1> that's why I added the third sentence to explain.
2010-12-02T11:54:49  <janzert> I am pretty amazed how long he held such a strong lead
2010-12-02T11:54:52  <a1k0n_> yeah i know.  i'm amused.
2010-12-02T11:55:21  <janzert> Hi mega1 :)
2010-12-02T11:55:45  <mega1> I found that what you wrote summed up pretty well how I feel.

2010-12-02T12:03:47  <mega1> I used this name first in the netflix contest.
2010-12-02T12:03:58  <a1k0n_> i've seen it many times.
2010-12-02T12:04:28  <janzert> mega1: thanks for the nice write up
2010-12-02T12:04:32  <a1k0n_> so, you have a bit vector of ship counts in your code, which i haven't fully understood
2010-12-02T12:05:01  <mega1> janzert: It's a pleasant obligation.
2010-12-02T12:05:18  <a1k0n_> i had a lot of trouble getting future moves scheduled and not generating incompatible orders subsequently
2010-12-02T12:05:25  <mega1> a1k0n_: it's not a bit vector. It's an integer vector.
2010-12-02T12:05:43  <a1k0n_> oh, right.
2010-12-02T12:05:53  <mega1> (16 bit wide)
2010-12-02T12:06:03  <a1k0n_> ohhh.
2010-12-02T12:06:15  <a1k0n_> i thought your comment was about the size of the array, not the width.
2010-12-02T12:06:37  <mega1> I'm confused now. Which comment?
2010-12-02T12:06:39  <a1k0n_> in that case i had the exact same thing.
2010-12-02T12:06:46  <mega1> ok
2010-12-02T12:07:01  <antimatroid> :s
2010-12-02T12:07:03  <a1k0n_> ;;; There are 23 planets, max growth is 5, 200 turns, 100 initial
2010-12-02T12:07:03  <a1k0n_> ;;; ships. (+ 100 (* 23 5 200)) is 23100 that fits into SHIP-COUNT.
2010-12-02T12:07:34  <a1k0n_> it's been a while since i'd written lisp; i thought you were implying the arrays were 23100 in size
2010-12-02T12:07:36  <mega1> yes, except the planet limit was raised and I forgot to update the code.
2010-12-02T12:07:40  <a1k0n_> yeah
2010-12-02T12:07:44  <a1k0n_> i had wondered.
2010-12-02T12:07:49  <a1k0n_> but i'm sure 16 bits sufficed nonetheless
2010-12-02T12:07:50  <mega1> a1k0n_: no it's calculating the width
2010-12-02T12:07:54  <mega1> yes

2010-12-02T12:59:27  <Frontier> I know. The comments on Reddit are as expected: "Do I need to continue reading it after he says Lisp isn't a compiled language?", :p
2010-12-02T12:59:46  <mega1> hey, that was an informed comment :-)

2010-12-02T13:00:40  <mega1> obscure fallout 2 reference
2010-12-02T13:00:42  <antimatroid> i was referring to people bitching about the comment on the homepage
2010-12-02T13:01:09  <antimatroid> i can't break the habit of checking my profile page
2010-12-02T13:01:25  <antimatroid> i've loaded it at least 10 times today
2010-12-02T13:04:35  <medrimonia> antimatroid: same for me... and each time I say to myself: "Nothing will change now, stop it"
2010-12-02T13:07:35  <a1k0n_> now i'm regretting not working hard enough to get into the top 100 at least
2010-12-02T13:07:57  <JamesMG> I'm regretting starting a rewrite around Nov 20 and never finishing
2010-12-02T13:08:52  <a1k0n_> at least one of my 10 branches was pretty close in approach; they all just suffered from some muddy thinking.  i had problems getting coordinated attacks working without constantly invalidating earlier coordinated attacks
2010-12-02T13:09:24  <a1k0n_> in the end i was a one-trick pony: i data mined an objective function and then greedily followed it.
2010-12-02T13:09:44  <mega1> and how did that objective function look like?
2010-12-02T13:09:46  <a1k0n_> (...on the early maps)
2010-12-02T13:10:00  <mega1> what was it a function of?
2010-12-02T13:10:02  <a1k0n_> it was a potential field sort of thing.
2010-12-02T13:10:44  <a1k0n_> the ships on each planet affected the 'potential' of the other planets by dist^-lambda falloff; lambda was optimized by observing a lot of games

2010-12-02T13:11:40  <a1k0n_> so basically any time i moved ships from a to b i would 'lose' the potential on a and gain it on b
2010-12-02T13:11:58  <a1k0n_> i of course plotted out the entire timeline of the game, etc, and used a fixed horizon to evaluate these things in the future

2010-12-02T13:12:20  <a1k0n_> the dynamic horizon approach hadn't occurred to me at all.. nor anyone else i think
2010-12-02T13:13:09  <a1k0n_> anyway, that was just one of my bots.  it did better than some others.  i don't really like the approach overall.  and changing the maps didn't help cuz i didn't retrain it
2010-12-02T13:13:29  <a1k0n_> (that was 0.5.1 i think)
2010-12-02T13:13:58  <mega1> were there many fundamentally different ones?

2010-12-02T13:14:14  <a1k0n_> i tried using simulated annealing over the future action space
2010-12-02T13:14:29  <a1k0n_> but that's where it would get completely destroyed by conflicting actions with no real way to resolve the conflict
2010-12-02T13:14:39  <a1k0n_> so it was useless in the end
2010-12-02T13:15:41  <a1k0n_> i also wrote a complete alpha-beta solver using all actions.  it was very, very, very slow.  i just wanted to know how slow, and what the optimal actions were on small games.

2010-12-02T13:17:59  <a1k0n_> i need to look into your code some more to figure out how you narrow the possible move space
2010-12-02T13:18:23  <mega1> all actions? that's not very slow, that's beyond the computational power of the universe?
2010-12-02T13:18:37  <a1k0n_> on very small maps with a low number of ships it isn't
2010-12-02T13:19:14  <mega1> did it handle simultaneous moves as well?
2010-12-02T13:19:18  <a1k0n_> yeah
2010-12-02T13:19:26  <a1k0n_> i had to truncate the search depth though
2010-12-02T13:19:34  <a1k0n_> come to think of it.
2010-12-02T13:19:40  <mega1> cool, that's a useful tool to test faster algos
2010-12-02T13:19:56  <a1k0n_> but yeah it's a lot of moves.
2010-12-02T13:20:27  <a1k0n_> do you actually separately decide how many ships to send, and later where to get them from?
2010-12-02T13:20:33  <mega1> yes
2010-12-02T13:20:49  <mega1> 'target step' is the vector of needed arrivals
2010-12-02T13:20:53  <a1k0n_> yeah
2010-12-02T13:21:11  <mega1> and I experimented with different ways of satisfying those needs
2010-12-02T13:21:17  <a1k0n_> but... how many potential sources do you generate for each target step?
2010-12-02T13:21:31  <mega1> in the final code only one
2010-12-02T13:21:44  <a1k0n_> oh, so it's a greedy fixup kind of thing more than an actual move generator
2010-12-02T13:21:51  <mega1> I mean one set of orders (= one 'step')
2010-12-02T13:22:11  <a1k0n_> but how many target steps do you generate and how?
2010-12-02T13:23:14  <a1k0n_> or step targets rather
2010-12-02T13:24:21  <mega1> a1k0n_: up to two in the final code
2010-12-02T13:24:25  <mega1> no, 3
2010-12-02T13:24:43  <mega1> one to defend against fleets in space
2010-12-02T13:25:20  <mega1> one to snipe

2010-12-02T14:56:11  <bhasker> isnt that like a bug, if the other bot had just sent all ships to the planet and not acquired more neutrals mega1s bot would have lost?
2010-12-02T14:59:05  <medrimonia> Smloh1: I hadn't seen the meaning of this moves by bocsimacko because I never expand if the ships spend can't be refund before turn 200, but it seems pretty effective yes
2010-12-02T15:04:33  <bhasker> i think my bot woud just go after his planet
2010-12-02T15:04:39  <bhasker> and not attack neutrals
2010-12-02T15:05:11  <bhasker> should try it out on that map against mega1s bot
2010-12-02T15:06:02  <medrimonia> bhasker: mega1 wouldn't have lost
2010-12-02T15:06:14  <bhasker> ah his ships can't reach
2010-12-02T15:06:18  <bhasker> it would still be a draw
2010-12-02T15:06:19  <medrimonia> I think he's sending his ships when num_turn+mindist=200
2010-12-02T15:06:20  <bhasker> at turn 200
2010-12-02T15:07:47  <bhasker> so basically launch and hope that the other bot does dumb stuff
2010-12-02T15:07:54  <bhasker> since there is nothing to lose?
2010-12-02T15:11:00  <lavalamp> I suspect that all moves evaluated the same and he just happened to pick that one
2010-12-02T15:14:50  <rebelxt> heh, just watched that game. nice move ;-) my bot would probably get screwed by that move as well
2010-12-02T15:15:40  <lavalamp> my bot starts using "total ship count at turn 200" as its eval function when it gets near the end
2010-12-02T15:16:01  <lavalamp> so it shouldn't do that particular stupid thing

2010-12-02T16:18:05  <janzert> bah, I want to make some database changes but before doing that I want a backup. It seems mysql will keep responding for only so long while the backup is in progress then decides to stop responding to queries.
2010-12-02T16:19:23  <janzert> anyway the backup is through 28G of 57G, maybe I'll just kill it and do it in the wee hours of the morning
2010-12-02T16:22:02  <Error323> janzert: well the wee hours in your morning are our afternoon :P
2010-12-02T16:22:05  <Error323> doesn't realy matter hehe
2010-12-02T16:22:59  <janzert> yeah, but overall traffic is still less in the wee hours of north america :}
2010-12-02T16:25:38  <politik> janzert: switching to InnoDB tables would probably help with that
2010-12-02T16:26:57  <janzert> politik: yeah, there are many reasons mysql w/ myisam aren't a good choice but that was all done before my time

2010-12-02T18:16:26  <Zannick> next contest will involve some sort of game
2010-12-02T18:16:37  <Zannick> players will enter by writing bots to play said game
2010-12-02T18:18:03  <Epona> or maybe itll be reverse, bots will program people to play games
2010-12-02T18:18:18  <Zannick> you will program a bot that will program a bot
2010-12-02T18:18:42  <sigh> or the games will play bots that will program people
2010-12-02T18:18:44  <sigh> what?
2010-12-02T18:19:21  <Epona> o.o
2010-12-02T18:19:23  <Zannick> we give players a bot and they have to program a game the bot wins at?
2010-12-02T18:19:25  <Epona> scariest game ever
2010-12-02T18:20:14  <lavalamp> it'd be interesting to do a related field of games... like at the beginning the server tells your bot what the rules are
2010-12-02T18:20:14  <sigh> Zannick: that could actually be an interesting exercise :P
2010-12-02T18:20:27  <sigh> like the dual problem of this contest
2010-12-02T18:20:52  <Zannick> better yet
2010-12-02T18:21:31  <Zannick> take an arbitrary top10 bot and generate a set of maps such that that bot wins the final
2010-12-02T18:21:38  <mega1> Zannick: thank you, I asked him to be polite.
2010-12-02T18:21:38  <Zannick> we could call it the Accoun AI contest

2010-12-02T18:21:52  <Zannick> mega1: cool
2010-12-02T18:22:05  <Epona> they need to make an ai contest exclusive to ai
