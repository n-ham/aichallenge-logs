2011-06-08T02:47:01  <stocha> it would be interesting to see how things go with 1vs1 also. Especially because there are not a lot of bots right now. Wen can then better understand how the multiplayer assymetry affect the game.

2011-06-08T05:18:58  <stocha> i can't get to the log.
2011-06-08T05:19:09  <stocha> chat log i mean.
2011-06-08T05:22:33  <antimatroid> you're a log :P
2011-06-08T05:22:53  <stocha> am i ?
2011-06-08T05:22:59  <stocha> any hope of a tcp server yet ?
2011-06-08T05:23:08  <antimatroid> don't think so sorry
2011-06-08T05:23:10  <stocha> some official words on the topic ?
2011-06-08T05:23:32  <stocha> i really think a tcp server should be an official goal.
2011-06-08T05:23:41  <antimatroid> my guess is that mcleopold is the only person currently up to working on it, and he's busy with other stuff
2011-06-08T05:23:50  <antimatroid> it is a goal, but not a top one atm i don
2011-06-08T05:23:51  <antimatroid> t think
2011-06-08T05:23:56  <antimatroid> it will happen
2011-06-08T05:24:10  <stocha> so there will be a tcp server before the end of the beta. good then.
2011-06-08T05:24:21  <antimatroid> i didn't say that
2011-06-08T05:24:30  <antimatroid> it would be nice, but i'm not claiming anything
2011-06-08T05:25:03  <stocha> what about the issus of top bots crashing on start 50% of the time ? (especially the java bot seems quite strong seeing they are in the top 10 and crash half of the time :p )
2011-06-08T05:25:21  <stocha> Will there be a beta with a lot of 1vs1 matches ?
2011-06-08T05:25:33  <stocha> are at least some.
2011-06-08T05:25:42  <antimatroid> the game isn't 1v1
2011-06-08T05:25:49  <antimatroid> the scoring doesn't work well with 1v1
2011-06-08T05:26:02  <stocha> it 1 vs Many. many raging from 1 to 10.
2011-06-08T05:26:26  <antimatroid> atm we can handle 1-25 enemies
2011-06-08T05:26:27  <stocha> what makes you think the scoring work well with one vs 2+ ?
2011-06-08T05:26:41  <antimatroid> but i suspect it'll be more like 3-5 enemies or so in the end
2011-06-08T05:26:57  <stocha> why does the jvm always crash ?
2011-06-08T05:27:00  <antimatroid> i can't say it will, but i can say it doesn't work for 1v1
2011-06-08T05:27:10  <antimatroid> because the beta server doesn't have enough memory?
2011-06-08T05:27:19  <stocha> how does it not work with 1vs1 ?
2011-06-08T05:27:21  <antimatroid> i think that's what i've seen be said, i'm in the middle of exams atm :P
2011-06-08T05:27:29  <stocha> why not start with 3 player games then ?
2011-06-08T05:27:38  <antimatroid> 3 player games i would be fine with
2011-06-08T05:27:57  <stocha> ah you are not active then :p
2011-06-08T05:28:11  <antimatroid> no, i have been watching mostly for a month or so
2011-06-08T05:28:23  <stocha> how is the exam doing fine ?
2011-06-08T05:28:32  <antimatroid> handed the first one in today
2011-06-08T05:28:42  <stocha> happy ?
2011-06-08T05:28:45  <stocha> confident
2011-06-08T05:28:51  <antimatroid> i thought it went not too well, but then i found out i was only meant to do 4/5 questions, so i'm much more confident
2011-06-08T05:28:58  <antimatroid> cause then my work question just gets thrown out
2011-06-08T05:29:08  <antimatroid> i enjoyed being able to study for an exam while i took it
2011-06-08T05:29:16  <antimatroid> worst**
2011-06-08T05:29:22  <stocha> ah okay :)
2011-06-08T05:29:27  <stocha> i was wondering what you meant :p
2011-06-08T05:29:36  <antimatroid> 48 hour take home exams <3
2011-06-08T05:29:46  <antimatroid> i have another one of those next week, then a normal 3 hour exam
2011-06-08T05:29:48  <stocha> You do some sport inbetween ?
2011-06-08T05:29:57  <antimatroid> sport?
2011-06-08T05:30:07  <antimatroid> i play (field) hockey, and ride a bike for commuting/wherever
2011-06-08T05:30:10  <stocha> yeah sport. football, tenis, water crawling etc.
2011-06-08T05:30:16  <antimatroid> except today, it's was windy, cold and raining, so i drove
2011-06-08T05:30:28  <stocha> it's said that it help to do some sport, before the exams.
2011-06-08T05:31:04  <stocha> I did a lot of jungling before the exams :). When i cared.
2011-06-08T05:31:29  <antimatroid> i usually get slack and then have to study on the night before
2011-06-08T05:32:42  <stocha> i've read it's not the best thing to do. Yet a lot of sucessfull exam people do that.
2011-06-08T05:33:05  <antimatroid> probably not the best, but it's the path of least amount of work :P
2011-06-08T05:33:17  <stocha> maybe exams are simply not worth optimizing too much the sucess rate :p
2011-06-08T05:33:34  <antimatroid> yeah, exams are a painful necessity
2011-06-08T05:33:51  <stocha> that seems weird then.
2011-06-08T05:33:54  <stocha> what are they for ?
2011-06-08T05:34:13  <antimatroid> testing ones knowledge of what was taught in a class, and knowing that you're testing that student
2011-06-08T05:35:00  <antimatroid> i don't like exams that the average person struggles to finish on time, or exams where it's just about memorising a bunch of crap, and multiple choice questions ridiculous
2011-06-08T05:35:09  <antimatroid> but otherwise they're not too bad

2011-06-08T05:36:18  <stocha> it's probably even worst not to have them. But it doesn't sound like very much effort was put into the subject. Although it seems quite important.
2011-06-08T05:37:01  <antimatroid> meh, i find if one goes to lectures and does the assignments one learns the material
2011-06-08T05:37:10  <stocha> Millions if not billions of people will be spending fifteen years of their life strugling with exam logic.
2011-06-08T05:37:18  <antimatroid> subjects i haven't cared about i just haven't gone to class for and done everything hte night before
2011-06-08T05:37:29  <antimatroid> i usually don't do well on those classes, but i get through
2011-06-08T05:37:54  <stocha> Was that the kind of behavior the exam builder are trying to encourage ?
2011-06-08T05:38:12  <antimatroid> depends on who writes the exam
2011-06-08T05:38:28  <stocha> i guess some simply do that to earn their salary :p
2011-06-08T05:38:50  <antimatroid> i'm at a small uni, so the lecturers are all actually pretty keen on the teaching side
2011-06-08T05:38:53  <antimatroid> which is nice
2011-06-08T05:38:55  <stocha> The world is a ship, with no one at the wheel. really.
2011-06-08T05:39:18  <stocha> they are very concerned with the subject they teach ?
2011-06-08T05:39:19  <antimatroid> bad thing is not much selection for pure maths, we've got one poor guy doing 3 classes for us this year on top of his undergrad classes
2011-06-08T05:39:37  <antimatroid> on that ship comment, you know of swarm intelligence yes?
2011-06-08T05:39:48  <stocha> i have heard of it. obviously.
2011-06-08T05:39:51  <antimatroid> i like to attribute a lot of the worlds problems to what i call swarm stupidity
2011-06-08T05:40:09  <antimatroid> the collective self interested actions of many individuals leading to worse outcomes for all
2011-06-08T05:40:14  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: can you show some questions or tasks examples?
2011-06-08T05:40:21  <stocha> and also about large group of human being  dumness. Panic dynamic and such.
2011-06-08T05:40:46  <stocha> It seems that when you put together dum ant or fish, you end up with some emerging cleverness.
2011-06-08T05:41:05  <stocha> and when you put together quite intelligent human being, you end up with emerging dumness.
2011-06-08T05:41:38  <stocha> maybe this is an oversimplification.
2011-06-08T05:42:40  <stocha> because there are some kind of clerverness to large group of human being. It is just not in par with expectations. And technological power.

2011-06-08T05:51:51  <mcstar> i did, it isnt really any different though
2011-06-08T05:51:57  <aerique> mcstar: the worker does "sbcl --script MyBot.lisp to compile it

2011-06-08T05:52:09  <mcstar> s
2011-06-08T05:53:49  <mcstar> is it possible that the worker doesnt update my files properly?

2011-06-08T05:55:57  <aerique> we needed to do that for planet wars
2011-06-08T05:56:10  <mcstar> ill try
2011-06-08T05:56:29  <mcstar> oh and the memory limit wasnt a porblem?
2011-06-08T05:56:29  <aerique> i assume (but haven't checked in the code) that when the worker sees output in stderr it assumes it fails
2011-06-08T05:56:46  *** Dlayne is now known as InsaneMalkavian
2011-06-08T05:57:02  <aerique> ofcourse it is. allocate less memory ;-)

2011-06-08T05:58:13  <mcstar> i see you had them too
2011-06-08T05:58:20  <mcstar> for the first submissions

2011-06-08T05:59:11  <aerique> mcstar: your bot only gets so much memory to use on the server, we were trying to find a good value for --dynamic-space-size
2011-06-08T05:59:15  <mcstar> sbcl says that it these options can be saved to the memory image
2011-06-08T05:59:32  <mcstar> and how much is it now?
2011-06-08T05:59:54  <aerique> mcstar: yeah, but i'm not sure if that's available in the sbcl used by the challenge (which is 1.0.40?)
2011-06-08T06:00:02  <aerique> mcstar: 256mb i think
2011-06-08T06:00:39  <mcstar> it isnt that old is it?
2011-06-08T06:00:44  <mcstar> i have 1.0.48
2011-06-08T06:00:49  <mcstar> and thats up to date
2011-06-08T06:01:21  <mcstar> all right, ill try redirecting
2011-06-08T06:01:30  <mcstar> thx aerique bon apetite
2011-06-08T06:01:57  <aerique> mcstar: it's not too old but the option to save the d-s-s limit to your image is pretty recent as well

2011-06-08T06:13:12  <UncleVasya> contestbot:  later tell McLeopold Please look at the line #344 of playgame.py. I believe it must be True there instead of False.
2011-06-08T06:13:12  <contestbot> UncleVasya: As you wish.
2011-06-08T06:16:08  <stocha> @later tell janzert you had your own ranking server up ?
2011-06-08T06:16:08  <contestbot> stocha: Aye, aye, sir
2011-06-08T06:16:47  <UncleVasya> stocha: yes, he had. For one day.
2011-06-08T06:23:20  <stocha> UncleVasya: what was the purpose ? to let people test their bot, or to test the server ?
2011-06-08T06:23:35  <UncleVasya> 2nd
2011-06-08T06:24:00  <stocha> I think it would be nice to have a place for people to test their bots also :)
2011-06-08T06:24:31  <stocha> tipically, people need to test serveral version of their bots at once. Trying to sort out features from one another.
2011-06-08T06:24:36  <UncleVasya> He was testing a server technology that will be used during the official contest.
2011-06-08T06:24:39  <stocha> and they need different kind of strong opposition for that.
2011-06-08T06:25:02  <mcstar> stocha: write your own engine
2011-06-08T06:25:28  <stocha> the trouble with tcp server (beside that there is none) is that people will need a machine to host their bot. Wich some won't be able to afford.
2011-06-08T06:25:43  <mcstar> the contest isnt started yet
2011-06-08T06:25:45  <stocha> why write my own engine, when there is already the official stuff ?
2011-06-08T06:26:20  <mcstar> i dont really understand whats the problem
2011-06-08T06:26:27  <stocha> what if my engine doesn't conform 100% with the official one (bug on either sides). Conclusions will be wrong then.
2011-06-08T06:26:52  <stocha> The testing different version of the bot problem ?
2011-06-08T06:28:17  <mcstar> the only real problem is the green banner/sidebar on that rust colored background
2011-06-08T06:36:56  <antimatroid> you run your bot locally for tcp
2011-06-08T06:42:39  <mcstar> this is getting ridiculous
2011-06-08T06:43:03  <mcstar> why does it keep compiling mybot???
2011-06-08T06:47:39  <UncleVasya> It found you bot's logic very interesting to learn.
2011-06-08T06:48:29  *** locutus2 <locutus2!~locutus2@62.152.161.149> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-08T06:50:50  <mcstar> i mean it shouldnt compile it
2011-06-08T06:51:07  <mcstar> the instructions are to load the files to memory and then to dump the image
2011-06-08T07:03:33  <aerique> it needs to compile to do that.  sbcl always compiles afaik
2011-06-08T07:03:48  <mcstar> Success: ready to play
2011-06-08T07:03:56  <mcstar> at last
2011-06-08T07:04:09  <mcstar> killing stderr helped
2011-06-08T07:04:32  <mcstar> the problem is that in that version the muffling had no effect
2011-06-08T07:04:48  <mcstar> it worked for me though
2011-06-08T07:05:44  <mcstar> and yes i read sbcl`s man page and it really always compiles
2011-06-08T07:07:14  <mcstar> so the conclusion is that it is not a good practice to muffle the warnings, because it might not work on the server, and the user is deceived
2011-06-08T07:07:57  <mcstar> and it should be noted somewhere explicitely to try to redirect stderr
2011-06-08T07:08:33  <mcstar> aerique: how about you put it in the .md for your starter pack?
2011-06-08T07:11:12  <aerique> mcstar: will do

2011-06-08T08:26:57  <UncleVasya> I am stiil watching my bot's PW games sometimes and give a links to an interesting ones to my friend.
2011-06-08T08:28:16  <UncleVasya> Who came with idea to use Galcon as a contest game that time?
2011-06-08T08:28:24  <antimatroid> someone on reddit
2011-06-08T08:28:40  <antimatroid> tron was awesome too

2011-06-08T08:30:57  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-08T08:31:04  <antimatroid> i expect a tron server to be quite popular

2011-06-08T08:31:35  <antimatroid> i "competed" in tron (:( bad memories)
2011-06-08T08:31:42  <antimatroid> the contests before that were waterloo based
2011-06-08T08:31:48  <UncleVasya> Stone-paper-scissors if I wrote it correctly.
2011-06-08T08:32:00  <antimatroid> i was sitting around 10th in tron before getting disqualified for timing out on one turn in one game
2011-06-08T08:32:12  <antimatroid> i didn't shut up until that rule was changed for pw, it was unecessarily harsh
2011-06-08T08:32:49  <antimatroid> really sucked working on a bot then not even getting a final ranking, especially when it looked so good :(

2011-06-08T08:54:13  <antimatroid> iteratively make a game tree, recycling what you have at the start of each turn, deleting the rest, then you have edge cases of lose/separate with less squares/draw/separate with at least as many squares/win, then otherwise rank "game states" based on the difference between the number of squares you can access first to what they can access first
2011-06-08T08:54:32  <antimatroid> then we had a "max path" heuristic thing for if the bots were in separated regions
2011-06-08T08:55:16  <antimatroid> if you can reach less squares, put that below draw, otherwise above etc.

2011-06-08T09:01:35  <antimatroid> it wont be good, but it'll be nice to watch
2011-06-08T09:01:50  <antimatroid> python's going to be pretty slow for this
2011-06-08T09:01:52  <guyverthree> the lanuage is so frustrating first time around
2011-06-08T09:02:02  <antimatroid> c++ <3 :P
2011-06-08T09:02:04  <mcstar> guyverthree: why didnt you try lisp?
2011-06-08T09:02:21  <olexs> I like how out of the top 10 bots, 7 are in C++...
2011-06-08T09:02:44  <antimatroid> look at that http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/rankings.php :P
2011-06-08T09:02:45  <guyverthree> i could try lisp
2011-06-08T09:03:05  <olexs> antimatroid: nice :)
2011-06-08T09:03:06  <antimatroid> top 10 was C++ for tron
2011-06-08T09:03:13  <guyverthree> mcstar i could try lisp
2011-06-08T09:03:26  <mcstar> yeah sure you could :D
2011-06-08T09:03:43  <olexs> I took part in the second contest, couldn't do anything in last 2 months before submission end though. finished in 400-ish place
2011-06-08T09:03:48  <antimatroid> guyverthree: use my c++ bot!
2011-06-08T09:03:48  <aerique> 11th was mega1 with lisp for tron :)
2011-06-08T09:03:52  *** BtbN <BtbN!btbn@btbn.de> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-08T09:03:52  <olexs> with java...
2011-06-08T09:03:58  <mcstar> hehe
2011-06-08T09:04:12  <antimatroid> aerique: yep, he had the worlds best hex bot a few years ago apparently
2011-06-08T09:04:16  <mcstar> i said lisp first, antimatroid
2011-06-08T09:04:22  <antimatroid> nah uh
2011-06-08T09:04:28  <antimatroid> (23:02:01) antimatroid: c++ <3 :P
2011-06-08T09:04:28  <antimatroid> (23:02:05) mcstar: guyverthree: why didnt you try lisp?
2011-06-08T09:04:42  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: I'm writing in functional language first time on this contest. Until that I even didn't see any code in OCaml.
2011-06-08T09:04:49  <mcstar> u said u love c++
2011-06-08T09:04:54  <mcstar> but i told him to try lisp
2011-06-08T09:04:57  <mcstar> hehe
2011-06-08T09:04:58  <antimatroid> it was implied
2011-06-08T09:05:03  <mcstar> ah sure implied
2011-06-08T09:05:06  <mcstar> >D
2011-06-08T09:05:08  <xQuasar> LOL my random bot obliterated a rank 25 bot - http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=17544
2011-06-08T09:05:24  <antimatroid> have you guys all got good food collection yet?
2011-06-08T09:05:31  <guyverthree> I am confused by the massive amonut of brackets
2011-06-08T09:05:43  <aerique> i haven't done anything except make a basic starter bot :-|
2011-06-08T09:05:44  <mcstar> thats parantheses not brackets
2011-06-08T09:05:46  <guyverthree> phython has no brackets
2011-06-08T09:05:47  <antimatroid> xQuasar: you're australian?
2011-06-08T09:05:49  <antimatroid> which state?
2011-06-08T09:05:54  <xQuasar> Yup! NSW - Sydney
2011-06-08T09:05:59  <guyverthree> yopu know what i mean....
2011-06-08T09:06:00  <antimatroid> tassie <3
2011-06-08T09:06:09  <olexs> mine can still be improved, but midgame the system seems to work fine. early game needs a lot of work
2011-06-08T09:06:24  <antimatroid> bloody everyone is nsw, you sigh and smiley
2011-06-08T09:06:35  <antimatroid> smiley might have been melbs
2011-06-08T09:06:39  <mcstar> guyverthree: give it some time, u will be able to parse it faster than python or c
2011-06-08T09:07:11  <xQuasar> antimatroid also my bot is completely random :P i'm gonna work on food collection tomorrow thoguh
2011-06-08T09:07:15  <antimatroid> i've got my food collection algorithm worked out
2011-06-08T09:07:23  <antimatroid> i just need to work out how to do fighting
2011-06-08T09:07:28  <xQuasar> antimatroid, keeping track of the changes is a bitch when all the information is sent every turn
2011-06-08T09:07:44  <antimatroid> worst is the implicit food information
2011-06-08T09:08:05  <olexs> antimatroid: what do you mean?
2011-06-08T09:08:11  <xQuasar> anyways i'm off
2011-06-08T09:08:12  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Every my food do BFS to find closest ant. I see some ways to optimise food gathering but now I having rest and dealing with testing aplication.
2011-06-08T09:08:12  <xQuasar> gnight
2011-06-08T09:08:18  <antimatroid> in that, if there was food on a square last time it was visible and it no longer is the next time it becomes visible, the only way you're told this is by not being told there's food there
2011-06-08T09:08:33  <xQuasar> UncleVasya: That's the way I'm planning to do my food collection!
2011-06-08T09:08:38  <xQuasar> UncleVasya: BFS from food :)
2011-06-08T09:09:16  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: are you restarting the search every time you collect a piece of food?
2011-06-08T09:09:23  <antimatroid> and are you reusing already used ants?
2011-06-08T09:09:23  <george1914> antimatroid:  hi, yes, i was the player george - i didnt think i got that many timeouts...   had timechecks almost everywhere...  i guess i was just unfortunate those times ...
2011-06-08T09:09:27  <guyverthree> well i'm off lunch now see you all later :)
2011-06-08T09:09:27  <xQuasar> antimatroid: in a way, the removal of 'r' is justified though - because it might be out of sight when it gets removed
2011-06-08T09:09:39  <xQuasar> and thus if 'r' was still there yo'd be effectively seeing out of your fog of war
2011-06-08T09:09:50  *** guyverthree <guyverthree!519182e7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.81.145.130.231> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-06-08T09:09:54  <antimatroid> xQuasar: you wouldn't have received the 'r' line until the square was visible
2011-06-08T09:10:03  <olexs> bfs from food makes most sense. however, it needs to be optimized; otherwise long distance from food to an ant can be preferred, although the ant in question might have food closer by
2011-06-08T09:10:09  <antimatroid> george1914: have you thought much about ants?
2011-06-08T09:10:20  <xQuasar> antimatroid: Oh. in that case, i think they should've kept 'r'
2011-06-08T09:10:24  *** xQuasar <xQuasar!xQuasar@123-243-2-159.static.tpgi.com.au> has quit IRC ()
2011-06-08T09:10:41  <antimatroid> i argued for 'r', but meh, just extra messy programming
2011-06-08T09:11:01  <antimatroid> olexs: there's better than simple bfs possible
2011-06-08T09:11:06  <antimatroid> i've described this a few times
2011-06-08T09:11:48  <olexs> antimatroid: i know, i also use something a bit different, that results in optimal distirbution of closest ants to all visible food
2011-06-08T09:11:55  <george1914> antimatroid: a little - my current bot just chases food it sees, and move randomly otherwise, with weights to make it explore, spread out etc ...
2011-06-08T09:12:03  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Currently yes. In future I'm planning not to stop but take attention to any food I'll find while do BFS and also mark ants in special way. So while doing one BFS I'll be able to deal with few pieces of food and few ants.
2011-06-08T09:12:17  <antimatroid> start with an "availability" grid, with ant locations at 0 and other squares as not available, then iteratively do a bfs from all non-collected food squares simultaneously until you find the ant that can get within the spawn radius of a food square fastest, update the availability information of that ants location, it's target location and the food location, remove the food and continue collecting
2011-06-08T09:12:40  <george1914> i have sketched a plan for a good one ...    but want to wait and see what the final settings are on eg  maps, combatradius, etc
2011-06-08T09:12:50  <olexs> something like that, yes
2011-06-08T09:12:57  <antimatroid> we're going for lots of variation on maps
2011-06-08T09:13:08  <george1914> dont want to craft specific rules for fighting, and then have the combatradius change ...
2011-06-08T09:13:25  <olexs> a good bot should work with any combat- or visibility-radius, taking those into account
2011-06-08T09:13:52  <antimatroid> yes, but a good bot might not necessarily win with the parameters used in the final contest
2011-06-08T09:13:59  <george1914> ok but eg corridors/maze would be worth having specific combat tactics for ...
2011-06-08T09:14:02  <antimatroid> optimising for parameters is something people want to do
2011-06-08T09:14:08  <antimatroid> ignoring it just places luck into the mix
2011-06-08T09:14:08  <olexs> also true
2011-06-08T09:14:17  <george1914> eg set 'trap' at some point - incoming ants always die
2011-06-08T09:14:27  <antimatroid> george1914: have you considered playing around with map generation?
2011-06-08T09:14:32  <UncleVasya> Also I'm planning to pay attention to the difference beetwen distances of ants and food so if one ant can gather few pieces of food on his way, these pieces are marked processed and they does not need to search for another ants.
2011-06-08T09:14:36  <george1914> but if those maps are rare/absent, then no need to spend time on that
2011-06-08T09:14:37  <antimatroid> i made the current map generator, we're planning another kind of symmetry
2011-06-08T09:14:47  <antimatroid> and if corridors become a problem, i will remove them
2011-06-08T09:14:55  <antimatroid> for the sake of an interesting contest
2011-06-08T09:15:00  <george1914> hm, map generation?  no
2011-06-08T09:15:06  <antimatroid> it's one of the funnest parts
2011-06-08T09:15:12  <george1914> :)
2011-06-08T09:15:22  <antimatroid> i was surprised when i could tesselate with odd/prime numbers of players
2011-06-08T09:15:32  <george1914> again - maybe i can figure out the map type, if i know size and that it has symmetry ...
2011-06-08T09:15:49  <antimatroid> the plan is to make that hard for you
2011-06-08T09:15:50  <george1914> can you do Penrose Tilings also?  :)
2011-06-08T09:15:58  <george1914> aha
2011-06-08T09:15:58  <antimatroid> hiding hte number of players and having more than one kind of symmetry
2011-06-08T09:16:10  * antimatroid goes to wikipedia
2011-06-08T09:16:20  <antimatroid> i tried doing the water with perlin noise, but never got anything nice
2011-06-08T09:16:30  <antimatroid> atm i just use a bunch of random walks to carve land out of water
2011-06-08T09:16:40  <george1914> basically, the competition looks great - most rule sets look ok, but i'd like to know which one is being used before i write too much code ...
2011-06-08T09:16:45  <UncleVasya> corridors seems to be interesting to me. Bots will be able to defend only few ways to their territory.
2011-06-08T09:17:08  <antimatroid> you should have been here when there was like 5 battle rules under consideration, let alone radiuses :P
2011-06-08T09:17:22  <george1914> i did watch that on the forums ...  :)
2011-06-08T09:17:29  <antimatroid> we didn't get the best option
2011-06-08T09:17:34  <antimatroid> apparently it wasn't intuitive enough
2011-06-08T09:18:31  <antimatroid> that was, let enemies(A) = no. enemies within attack radius of ant A, A lives if |enemies(A)| < |enemies(B)| for all B \in enemies(A)
2011-06-08T09:18:32  <UncleVasya> in case the whole map are the corridors then it might be interesting to see how ants are filling them.
2011-06-08T09:18:50  <antimatroid> it seems complicated, but once you understand it, it's the ultimate battle rule
2011-06-08T09:18:56  <mcstar> george1914: theres a limit of 2MB for an upload, pls dont exceed that limit with your code
2011-06-08T09:19:22  <george1914> the one that i am most unsure about is the multiplayer aspect ...    in eg risk - you gang up on the strong players, maintain balance of power - the best player often loses ...   will things like that happen here also?  :)
2011-06-08T09:19:28  <george1914> that would be hard to plan for
2011-06-08T09:19:37  <antimatroid> one option if corridors become a problem is doing random walks with random nxn blocks, so not as many corridors exist
2011-06-08T09:19:54  <antimatroid> george1914: i don't expect people to be able to gang up that well
2011-06-08T09:20:11  <antimatroid> and besides, you want to take out the person who is likely to possibly rank higher than you
2011-06-08T09:20:26  <antimatroid> the battle rules allow for cooperation, but i don't plan to count on it
2011-06-08T09:20:52  <antimatroid> it's going to be hard enough that you have n-players and non-zero sum, so you can't assume they're rational like you do with normal backward induction for example
2011-06-08T09:20:54  <antimatroid> wont work like that
2011-06-08T09:21:22  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: no, I do not reuse ants for another search. I mark them busy until the end of turn. But if on the next turn some another food will find this ant faster than his previous destination, he can change his task.
2011-06-08T09:21:27  <antimatroid> besides, game trees are pretty much out anyway, too many damn ants
2011-06-08T09:21:31  <george1914> mcstar: hi, did i exceed that?  i really thought not ... the zip files are a few k
2011-06-08T09:21:35  <dr-> you were talking about languages, but is there some kind of flexibility about the language used or not ?
2011-06-08T09:22:01  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: take a look at my description of mine, it's a pretty solid food collection algorithm
2011-06-08T09:22:05  * mcstar was joking, because you were worried about writing too much code
2011-06-08T09:22:10  <dr-> I mean, if I use python rather than c, which is slower, does it count for the timeout or resources ?
2011-06-08T09:22:15  <antimatroid> you can make minor tweaks in different places depending on how you want your bot to behave
2011-06-08T09:22:17  <george1914> ah, i see, thanks  :)
2011-06-08T09:22:37  <antimatroid> george1914: i updated the c++ bot the other day too btw
2011-06-08T09:22:42  <antimatroid> it was still processing 'r' lines
2011-06-08T09:22:54  <antimatroid> also, any hate on how i've done that?
2011-06-08T09:23:04  <antimatroid> ignoring the fact that i'm a communist programmer (everything is public)
2011-06-08T09:23:19  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: heheh, I've copypasted your description to the notepad a few days ago :)
2011-06-08T09:23:29  <UncleVasya> But didn't read it yet.
2011-06-08T09:23:37  <mcstar> dr-: all languages are treated the sae way
2011-06-08T09:23:39  <mcstar> same
2011-06-08T09:24:02  <mcstar> you dont get extra time just because you use python
2011-06-08T09:24:07  <mcstar> if that what u meant
2011-06-08T09:24:11  <dr-> okay, like I tought ...
2011-06-08T09:24:17  <antimatroid> you pick your language, you get the limitations/benefits that come with it
2011-06-08T09:24:19  <antimatroid> that's the deal
2011-06-08T09:24:28  <dr-> yeah, it was the question
2011-06-08T09:24:34  <dr-> understandable
2011-06-08T09:24:37  <antimatroid> yep, just stating hte official opinion :)
2011-06-08T09:25:09  <antimatroid> but, my favourite saying, you get to pick your language then go to town doing whatever the hell you want :)
2011-06-08T09:25:13  <mcstar> and now comes the part when antimatroid asks you to check out his c++ starter bot
2011-06-08T09:25:24  <george1914> it seemed ok to me, but then my c++ is not perfect ...  i maybe did change some things, eg make some fns const, remove 'using namespace std', but mainly my own preferences
2011-06-08T09:25:28  <antimatroid> mcstar: i shall convert everyone!
2011-06-08T09:25:39  <mcstar> godspeed
2011-06-08T09:25:52  <jbroman> All hail Stroustrop!
2011-06-08T09:25:53  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm far from being a good programmer
2011-06-08T09:25:57  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-08T09:26:08  <UncleVasya> dr-: You can write a faster code in some language only if you can write a faster code in this language.
2011-06-08T09:26:19  <antimatroid> i have my own "starter bot" that's a bit more complicated than the starter package one
2011-06-08T09:26:38  <antimatroid> the main target for those are people who aren't capable/not willing to write a bot from scratch themselves
2011-06-08T09:26:53  <antimatroid> i expect any serious competitor to pretty much start from scratch
2011-06-08T09:26:53  <dr-> it would be interesting to compare c++ and python (for example) with the same behaviour
2011-06-08T09:27:27  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: I think Greedy bot is pretty good for these people to look at.
2011-06-08T09:28:16  <antimatroid> the idea is to have it so easy that a complete beginner programmer (that can compile and run programs) can get started, yet still have enough depth that it's interesting for people at the top
2011-06-08T09:28:54  <dr-> antimatroid: what does your starter bot that the basic one don't ?
2011-06-08T09:29:07  <antimatroid> it doesn't do anything strategy wise more
2011-06-08T09:29:15  <antimatroid> i just structure things different for myself
2011-06-08T09:29:19  <antimatroid> more opeators, more structs etc.
2011-06-08T09:29:40  <antimatroid> and i like to put in little hax functions that make my life easier
2011-06-08T09:29:58  <UncleVasya> Here does everything that starter bot does but in very complicated mathematician way:)
2011-06-08T09:30:21  <UncleVasya> His bot proofs theoretically every move he wants to do.
2011-06-08T09:30:28  <antimatroid> you can all thank me for not having to use godawful x,y indexing too
2011-06-08T09:30:34  <antimatroid> that would have been ever so painful
2011-06-08T09:30:50  <UncleVasya> One proof = 2-3 log pages
2011-06-08T09:31:02  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: the state space for games is RIDICULOUSLY large, like larger than I would have though before playing around with ai game
2011-06-08T09:31:03  <antimatroid> ss
2011-06-08T09:31:25  <antimatroid> however, my honours thesis this year is on game theory :P
2011-06-08T09:31:27  <antimatroid> but theory side
2011-06-08T09:32:08  <UncleVasya> godawful x,y indexing?
2011-06-08T09:32:34  <antimatroid> you know when you write on a page/in a document you go to the line and then write/read along that?
2011-06-08T09:32:52  <antimatroid> if you use x,y indexing, you need to transpose your grid every time you read/write it to file
2011-06-08T09:32:57  <antimatroid> which is incredibly confusing
2011-06-08T09:33:18  <antimatroid> if you use row,col, you never ever have you think about that
2011-06-08T09:33:23  <antimatroid> it's just always consistent
2011-06-08T09:33:52  <mcstar> lol
2011-06-08T09:34:09  <antimatroid> besides, that's how you index matrices :P
2011-06-08T09:34:10  <mcstar> you can always associate y with row x with col
2011-06-08T09:34:34  <antimatroid> and then when you output your moves?
2011-06-08T09:34:40  <mcstar> i called my functions with (somefun rows cols y x)
2011-06-08T09:34:42  <antimatroid> you need to translate your 'n' values
2011-06-08T09:34:52  <antimatroid> i would advise you just use row,col
2011-06-08T09:35:04  <antimatroid> it might take a bit of getting used to, but then there is no confusion/stupid bugs
2011-06-08T09:35:10  <dr-> x and y always confused me ... I never know which corresponds to column :/
2011-06-08T09:35:15  <mcstar> it was no problem but for reasons of symmetry i now use row for y and col for x
2011-06-08T09:35:37  <antimatroid> yes, but are you also careful of which order you use them in?
2011-06-08T09:35:47  <antimatroid> people use x,y but row,col, they are swapped
2011-06-08T09:35:54  <antimatroid> which gives your translation
2011-06-08T09:35:55  <dr-> yeah, but my friend cannot understand my code
2011-06-08T09:36:08  <antimatroid> dr-: success then? :P
2011-06-08T09:36:18  <UncleVasya> In my starter pack I've renamed row variable to x and col to y (because it's a usual way i'm reading coordinates) but I didn't thought about the real difference beetwen these concepts.
2011-06-08T09:36:18  <dr-> natural obfuscation
2011-06-08T09:36:37  <mcstar> ??
2011-06-08T09:36:42  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: I recommend you use row,col and start thinking like that
2011-06-08T09:36:45  <antimatroid> it's confusing as hell otherwise
2011-06-08T09:36:46  <mcstar> wtf its the opposite
2011-06-08T09:36:56  <antimatroid> x,y , col,row
2011-06-08T09:36:58  <antimatroid> that is the same
2011-06-08T09:37:04  <antimatroid> but people use x,y then row,col
2011-06-08T09:37:14  <mcstar> UncleVasya just wrote it the opposite way
2011-06-08T09:37:21  <antimatroid> oh, then that's even more confusing :P
2011-06-08T09:37:50  <antimatroid> think of it like indexing the line, then word/character on a page
2011-06-08T09:38:28  <antimatroid> and matrix multiplication is easy, for A.B = C, C_ij = row i of A dot col j of B
2011-06-08T09:38:38  <mcstar> imagine nothing, thats my bots name, only think in rows/cols, u can really get rid of x,y
2011-06-08T09:39:11  <antimatroid> i almost went with a robot unicorn/charlie candy mountain theme with my planet wars bot
2011-06-08T09:39:25  <antimatroid> as in i renamed everything to fit that theme, then got sick of it within 2 days and swapped back
2011-06-08T09:39:41  <mcstar> :D
2011-06-08T09:39:46  <antimatroid> it would be funny to win the contest and then release the code
2011-06-08T09:39:51  <antimatroid> and everyone be like wtf are you on
2011-06-08T09:39:55  <mcstar> my bot-logic file is called illogical

2011-06-08T09:41:03  <antimatroid> oh, something you guys might not realise, if you have ants not moving, food will wait to spawn there until you move
2011-06-08T09:41:04  <mcstar> once you finish the code, you can always run it through an obfuscator
2011-06-08T09:41:09  <antimatroid> so leaving ants static can be a bad idea

2011-06-08T09:41:39  <antimatroid> that's how symmetric spawning works

2011-06-08T09:42:01  <mcstar> Frontier`s masterplan was based on sitting duck bots

2011-06-08T09:42:28  <antimatroid> my requirements for symmetry are that a deterministic bot (including coordinates) should always draw with itself
2011-06-08T09:43:20  <mcstar> you mean on average right?
2011-06-08T09:43:20  <UncleVasya> I thing I understood. In my county x always means horisontal coordinate of a matrix and y lways means vertical coordinate. So x in my country = row in your and my y = col of you.
2011-06-08T09:43:20  <Frontier> Is that behaviour documented antimatroid?
2011-06-08T09:43:33  <antimatroid> Frontier: not sure, sigh and i devised it a while ago
2011-06-08T09:43:46  <antimatroid> i for one would actually be interested in doing away with spawning of food
2011-06-08T09:44:01  <antimatroid> that way you can explore the map and have information about where no food is anymore
2011-06-08T09:44:11  <antimatroid> we don't really want long ass games anyway right?
2011-06-08T09:44:28  <Frontier> hmm, not sure :p
2011-06-08T09:44:34  <antimatroid> but i suspect it's too late to make such a change
2011-06-08T09:44:36  <mcstar> UncleVasya: the first part is correct, the second part is the opposite
2011-06-08T09:45:16  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: i don't believe any mathematicians anywhere index matrices with x,y

2011-06-08T09:47:44  <Frontier> UncleVasya: no, they are stored somewhere else in a playernames variable, take a look at the wiki. It is documented there.
2011-06-08T09:48:33  <antimatroid> my algebra lecturer will write like 1.3.5
2011-06-08T09:48:38  <antimatroid> or even 1.3
2011-06-08T09:48:40  <UncleVasya> So replay file never stores it?
2011-06-08T09:48:47  <antimatroid> although to be fair, i've never seen the man write a decimal
2011-06-08T09:49:35  <Frontier> UncleVasya: If you run a local game, no. On the test server the names are added after the game finishes, I think.
2011-06-08T09:50:11  <Frontier> UncleVasya: You can download a game from the server using /game/<id> as the url.
2011-06-08T09:50:45  <UncleVasya> I have a replay made by local game and before open it in browser I want to input player names instead of "Player1, Player2...". I thoght I can just edit replay-file.
2011-06-08T09:50:46  <Frontier> There you will find the playernames you are looking for.
2011-06-08T09:51:14  <UncleVasya> I'll try it now.
2011-06-08T09:52:09  <Frontier> You can add them to your local replay files in the same way. Maybe you want to use a JSON programming library for that.
2011-06-08T09:53:27  <UncleVasya> I am consider 0.replay as a textfile.

2011-06-08T09:59:22  <Frontier> I heard that you can install MacOS X on a PC with some hacks. That's interesting since I could write cross-platform apps then without Java, testing them on my own PC under Windows/Linux/MacOS
2011-06-08T09:59:24  <antimatroid> use c++ with mingw and code::blocks

2011-06-08T10:01:38  <berak> the one i got from git pull

2011-06-08T10:02:06  <Frontier> btw, you can now "python playgame.py ... | java -jar visualizer.jar". But since the orders are not in the streaming replay you see no movement yet.
2011-06-08T10:02:46  <Frontier> In other words: this is a live game preview that I had to write another 1000 lines of code for  :p

2011-06-08T11:55:56  * McLeopold already started that
2011-06-08T11:56:28  <McLeopold> janzert: there are 2 new milestones for launch and after launch
2011-06-08T11:56:49  <janzert> ok
2011-06-08T11:57:33  <janzert> redo favicon can be post launch ;)
2011-06-08T11:57:55  <McLeopold> yeah, but it should be done now
2011-06-08T11:58:05  <janzert> in either case I don't see that list happening within a week
2011-06-08T11:58:16  <McLeopold> computerwiz_222 doesn't seem to be very active here
2011-06-08T11:58:17  <janzert> that 2 a day :P
2011-06-08T11:58:52  <McLeopold> I'm thinking we should just launch and deal with the fallout
2011-06-08T11:59:20  <Frontier> so does the engine write out the bonus to the replay? I have a hacked replay that works nicely: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/stable/visualizer.php?game=8
2011-06-08T11:59:24  <janzert> btw, I ran an ec2 worker yesterday both without secure jails and disabling secure jail pause and resume seemed to be around the same speed as the current worker
2011-06-08T11:59:41  <McLeopold> that's good
2011-06-08T12:00:01  <McLeopold> so, then we need to try your other idea of a listener within the process?
2011-06-08T12:00:04  <janzert> McLeopold: well we really should get the launch milestone down to the minimal set of things that need to be done before launching
2011-06-08T12:00:04  *** okay is now known as okayzed
2011-06-08T12:00:18  <janzert> I know jails working and email are at least on that list
2011-06-08T12:00:29  <janzert> invalid replays
2011-06-08T12:00:36  <janzert> getting money?
2011-06-08T12:00:51  <janzert> at least a temporary source from somewhere
2011-06-08T12:01:19  <Frontier> temporary source is commonly called a credit
2011-06-08T12:01:26  <janzert> :)
2011-06-08T12:01:48  <McLeopold> Frontier: if food bonus isn't working, can you fix it?  or at least create an issue on github
2011-06-08T12:01:49  <janzert> in this case I'm thinking of Jeff's pocket ;)
2011-06-08T12:02:18  <McLeopold> He said that's what he would do, to motivate him to get money.
2011-06-08T12:02:26  <Frontier> McLeopold: You mean... I should edit Phyton code?
2011-06-08T12:02:43  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-06-08T12:03:28  <janzert> McLeopold: so if you want to push launch as soon as possible, mind if I get a little more ruthless on the milestone?
2011-06-08T12:03:40  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-06-08T12:03:57  <janzert> you do mind?
2011-06-08T12:05:21  <McLeopold> well, I'm not going to work any faster, or be able to create more time
2011-06-08T12:05:38  <janzert> by ruthless I mean remove things from it
2011-06-08T12:05:48  <McLeopold> just move to after launch
2011-06-08T12:05:55  <janzert> so it is a truer guide on when we can really launch
2011-06-08T12:06:02  <janzert> yep, that's my plan
2011-06-08T12:06:49  <janzert> there's a start :)
2011-06-08T12:08:15  <McLeopold> 3 month for the contest?
2011-06-08T12:08:40  <janzert> 2 is the number I've been hearing and rather favor except...
2011-06-08T12:09:05  <janzert> 3 would be rather nice to push us into the start of the north american school year
2011-06-08T12:09:20  <McLeopold> we do we want that?
2011-06-08T12:09:54  <McLeopold> I think trying to start a new contest after this in september would be better
2011-06-08T12:10:01  <janzert> yeah, especially if we could get into say around the 3rd week of september
2011-06-08T12:10:08  <Naktibalda> you are very optimistic
2011-06-08T12:10:19  <McLeopold> The game stuff is easy
2011-06-08T12:10:36  <McLeopold> It's the process handling and trueskill that's been killing us
2011-06-08T12:11:23  <janzert> I think there's very little chance we'll launch another before mid october
2011-06-08T12:11:26  <McLeopold> I've got a few ideas for new games I can code while this contest is running
2011-06-08T12:11:33  <janzert> more likely next january
2011-06-08T12:11:47  <McLeopold> I guess I am optimistic
2011-06-08T12:12:50  <Frontier> McLeopold: issue 159 looks interesting. what the heck is happening there?
2011-06-08T12:13:13  <McLeopold> I don't know
2011-06-08T12:13:40  <McLeopold> I could be anything from a bug in the engine to a corrupted replay to bad visualizer code
2011-06-08T12:16:04  <Frontier> wait... these are all cases of ant collisions
2011-06-08T12:17:36  <Frontier> It just looks odd because there is just one big brown area.

2011-06-08T12:19:10  <Frontier> no

2011-06-08T12:20:34  <Frontier> janzert: Take a close look. The ants that stand alone against two attackers die while the attackers (both receiving 1/2 damage) survive
2011-06-08T12:20:43  <janzert> right
2011-06-08T12:21:55  <McLeopold> oh, I see it now
2011-06-08T12:22:10  <janzert> I wonder if there's a way to better show two ants in a block of ants are stepping onto each other
2011-06-08T12:22:16  <McLeopold> Frontier: so, a collision x or something would be really helpful
2011-06-08T12:22:59  <janzert> maybe some sort of crosshatching where ants are overlapping?
2011-06-08T12:23:15  <McLeopold> Frontier: also, can you make the lines indicate if the attack worked both ways or not?  Maybe arrow heads?
2011-06-08T12:23:57  <McLeopold> Or light up ants that recieved over 1 damage, and something different for those that receive less?

2011-06-08T13:35:15  <Frontier> Is this Firefox?

2011-06-08T13:36:04  <McLeopold> The quick fix looks nice, but you still need to distiguish between a collision death and an attack death.
2011-06-08T13:36:09  <Frontier> other than that maybe the Json has illegal characters in it, like "

2011-06-08T16:02:54  <berak> hey, if the top notch bot did not kill the only other survivor(1 ant left)  in turn 200, it's pretty unlikely, it will happen anywhere from now till turn 20000. whykeep the game alive in this case till turn 2000 ? there was  a clear winner earlier on, keeping it alive further on, will just cause more entropy/global_warming/khattam_shud

2011-06-08T16:03:42  <McLeopold> that's why we have the food bonus to discourage this

2011-06-08T16:06:10  <McLeopold> @later tell janzert do you think we could come up with a simple way to call a game over early?

2011-06-08T16:06:25  <berak> isn't having like 300 turns enough ?

2011-06-08T16:07:08  <locutus2> McLeopold: which values have the trueskill parameters beta and draw prob currently?
2011-06-08T16:07:22  <McLeopold> I'm thinking 10 turns with spawning only going to 1 bot, or something like that
2011-06-08T16:07:46  <locutus2> because this game specific parameters, it might be useful to estimate this based on the played games yet
2011-06-08T16:08:16  <McLeopold> locutus2: I think draw_probability is at 1%, beta is calculated from that

2011-06-08T16:10:16  <locutus2> i would do the job if i get the appropiate tables of the database
2011-06-08T16:10:56  <locutus2> and it would be interesting to see sigma in the ranking, to see how variable the current skill is
2011-06-08T16:12:16  <locutus2> The displayed skill is the mean or mean-3*sigma (like the original trueskill version)?
2011-06-08T16:12:32  <McLeopold> -3*sigma
2011-06-08T16:13:01  <McLeopold> but the starter bots really throw off the draw probability

2011-06-08T16:14:08  <locutus2> yes the draw prob should be near zero, so i think 2% percent is ok
2011-06-08T16:15:52  <locutus2> the beta value instead stands aprox. for the needed strength-difference to reache a 80%/20% win ratio
2011-06-08T16:16:15  <locutus2> sorry i mean <1% for draw prob
2011-06-08T16:17:25  <locutus2> the less random a game is the lower beta

2011-06-08T16:31:18  <jmcarthur> something nice about tron was that the usable map gradually got smaller, so we didn't really need to artificially end a game. we should just make the map get smaller over time to force ants to fight ;)

2011-06-08T19:34:50  <janzert> so just leave it for the moment
2011-06-08T19:35:03  <janzert> if it's the last thing holding us up from launching we ca throw it out
2011-06-08T19:35:10  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-08T19:38:03  <janzert> amstan: did you see this actually cause a problem? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/117
2011-06-08T19:38:27  <janzert> it works for me everytime
2011-06-08T19:38:54  <McLeopold> janzert: I just remembered, you need to pass -Xmx100m to the popen stuff in manager
2011-06-08T19:39:11  <McLeopold> or less
2011-06-08T19:40:45  <janzert> so long as I'm not running a second worker against the beta server it doesn't cause a problem since it is called in between games
2011-06-08T19:40:54  <janzert> :/
2011-06-08T19:41:31  <davidjliu> is skill supposed to be an absolute measurement?
2011-06-08T19:41:40  <janzert> not really
2011-06-08T19:41:54  <davidjliu> are they greyed-out players former #1s?
2011-06-08T19:42:00  <McLeopold> more absolute than the bayeselo
2011-06-08T19:42:02  <janzert> it's not anchored in any way at all
2011-06-08T19:42:13  <davidjliu> k
2011-06-08T19:42:14  <McLeopold> anchored between 0 and 100
2011-06-08T19:42:17  <janzert> bayeselo actually was anchored for the latter half of the contest
2011-06-08T19:42:29  <McLeopold> it's trueskill
2011-06-08T19:42:33  <janzert> not anchored it's bounded
2011-06-08T19:42:38  <janzert> more or less at least
2011-06-08T19:42:53  <janzert> bounded with a high probability to 0 through 100
2011-06-08T19:42:55  <McLeopold> meh
2011-06-08T19:43:32  <McLeopold> so, the rankings look off because we never adjusted beta or tau for the different starting mu
2011-06-08T19:43:32  <janzert> it's a different thing though than anchored
2011-06-08T19:45:26  <janzert> btw, where do you get tau from? in the original paper it seems to be gamma
2011-06-08T19:45:56  <McLeopold> from here, aka, the dynamic http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html
2011-06-08T19:47:56  <janzert> ahh, in the comments?
2011-06-08T19:48:00  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-06-08T19:48:05  <McLeopold> I have a git issue...
2011-06-08T19:48:22  <janzert> weird I wonder why the name got changed. ahh well
2011-06-08T19:48:33  <McLeopold> git diff is showing no changes, but git status shows the files modified
2011-06-08T19:48:47  <McLeopold> I know there are changes there, and I'd like to see them
2011-06-08T19:48:48  <janzert> did git add the files already?
2011-06-08T19:48:53  <janzert> git diff HEAD
2011-06-08T19:49:15  <McLeopold> ding! problem solved
2011-06-08T19:49:40  <janzert> just cause I've had the same problem more than once :)

2011-06-08T20:03:06  <janzert> McLeopold: regarding game length, a way to cut off games early would be nice but I'm not sure of a fair way to do it. Someone needs to run some statistics on the beta server games ;)
2011-06-08T20:03:37  <janzert> e.g. average game length, average move the eventual winner took the lead, etc.
2011-06-08T20:03:56  <janzert> and histograms of both
2011-06-08T20:05:29  <janzert> histograms showing the move the eventual winner took the lead and the move that all bots were in their final ranks would be really great for determining an appropriate game length to use
