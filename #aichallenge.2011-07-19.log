2011-07-19T08:17:42  <mcstar> i just have a comment
2011-07-19T08:17:55  <mcstar> i think the best explanation is the Maht one
2011-07-19T08:18:01  <mcstar> it should  be way up
2011-07-19T08:18:31  <mcstar> and probably use \epsilon for enemies
2011-07-19T08:18:43  <mcstar> and write st out full, such that:
2011-07-19T08:18:56  <mcstar> do you agree?
2011-07-19T08:20:00  <antimatroid> the thing with the maths explanation is it only makes sense to those of us who are somewhat familiar with maths
2011-07-19T08:20:17  <antimatroid> those of us who understand it love it, but others are like what?
2011-07-19T08:20:31  <mcstar> argh, i find it far more understandable than that "story" and such
2011-07-19T08:20:49  <antimatroid> so do i
2011-07-19T08:21:02  <antimatroid> i like simple and neat
2011-07-19T08:21:30  <antimatroid> but i will abuse the hell out of notation to get something aesthetically pleasing if it suites me, so i'm a bad judge for general people
2011-07-19T08:22:16  <mcstar> i dont know any generals at all
2011-07-19T08:22:24  <mcstar> so i cant judge either

2011-07-19T19:23:03  <jbrechtel> Hi, my bot has been stuck on 'compiling and running test cases' for a few hours now.  Is there a problem with the worker or is it something wrong with just my bot?
2011-07-19T19:25:21  <amstan> is the worker on?
2011-07-19T19:26:52  <jbrechtel> Are you asking me?  It *seems* like it is because it's the worker that toggles submissions from 'Uploaded' to 'Compiling and running tests'
2011-07-19T19:27:00  <jbrechtel> and I'm in the latter status
2011-07-19T19:27:17  <jbrechtel> Though since I've been there for a few hours perhaps the worker was shut off in the middle of compiling my submission
2011-07-19T19:27:19  <amstan> see http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/server_stats.php
2011-07-19T19:27:55  <jbrechtel> Thanks, didn't know about that.
2011-07-19T19:29:20  <jbrechtel> That page doesn't tell me anything about worker status.  Though the games per minute for the last 5 minutes is 1.6 so it would seem that workers are active.
2011-07-19T19:30:06  <jbrechtel> I'll try to upload my code again...maybe the worker just died while compiling or testing.

2011-07-19T19:38:41  <janzert> congratulations, looks like the new scala code/bot manages to crash the sandbox ;)
2011-07-19T19:40:10  <janzert> it is using the maximum number of processes/threads allowed in a jail during the functional test, which then crashes the sandbox when it tries to sudo to the jailuser and execute the kill command

2011-07-19T19:53:37  <jbrechtel> janzert: Oops!  I don't understand why that's happening.  It certainly didn't happen when I tested it locally.
2011-07-19T19:54:22  <jbrechtel> Anything I can do to help?  Is it just the Scala compiler that's doing that?  I didn't *think* it was multithreaded by default.  And there is no threading going on in my bot.
2011-07-19T19:54:37  <janzert> I would guess you pretty certainly aren't testing in a secure sandbox locally, since it takes quite a convoluted machine setup to do so :/
2011-07-19T19:55:04  <jbrechtel> Hmm....so what exactly do you mean by secure sandbox?  My workers are running in jails.
2011-07-19T19:55:04  <janzert> I /fixed/ it temporarily by just upping the process limit again
2011-07-19T19:55:16  <janzert> working on a real fix now
2011-07-19T19:56:18  <janzert> the secure sandbox uses chroots and separate jail user accounts to run the programs under
2011-07-19T19:56:41  <jbrechtel> Yay!  My Scala bot is playing!  Thanks a lot
2011-07-19T19:56:57  <janzert> if you're doing a full worker setup then if you select secure jails you probably really are using them
2011-07-19T20:00:50  <jbrechtel> I selected the option to create bot jails when prompted...yes.  The script didn't mention secure jails so I don't know if there's a distinction there.  My jails do each have their own user as well.
2011-07-19T20:02:55  <janzert> ahh, you probably are using secure jails then. you can check that your worker/server_info.py is set to True for secure jails and you should see stuff on the console about changing the owner on the chroot directory when running anything that uses the sandbox
2011-07-19T20:03:51  <jbrechtel> Yes, secure_jail is true in server_info.py and it does mention chrooting directories when I run a worker.
2011-07-19T20:04:02  <jbrechtel> However, I'm not using the cron job to start workers...the script didn't seem to install it.
2011-07-19T20:04:04  <janzert> sounds like you are then
2011-07-19T20:04:11  <jbrechtel> I am just doing sh start_worker.sh as the contest user.
2011-07-19T20:04:39  <janzert> that shouldn't make any difference for the sandboxing
2011-07-19T20:05:15  <janzert> I've run into it before where the JVM used a different number of threads on my machine than the ec2 workers for some reason
2011-07-19T20:07:29  <jbrechtel> Ah.  Strange.  So what is using too many threads, scala or scalac?  I guess it'd be scala/actually running the bot...since my patch didn't change compilation.
2011-07-19T20:07:39  <janzert> scala
2011-07-19T20:07:49  <janzert> it was during the functional test itself

2011-07-19T21:18:23  <jmcarthur> maybe instead of limiting the number of threads we could just penalize bots that are observed to use >100% CPU

2011-07-19T22:36:17  <janzert> well, the number of threads(processes) has to be limited at something just so a bot can't fork bomb the worker
