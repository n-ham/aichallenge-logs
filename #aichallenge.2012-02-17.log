2012-02-17T12:16:43  <|UncleVasya|> you can type them only if you'll switch to the English layout
2012-02-17T12:16:44  <mleise> I see so many people using Pascal come from "Cyrillic" countries. And Pascal uses and and or instead of && and ||

2012-02-17T12:19:41  <|UncleVasya|> Yes, I'm sure. The real reason - our education system sux. Except few big cities where really good schools and universities.
2012-02-17T12:19:57  <|UncleVasya|> *educational

2012-02-17T12:22:14  <|UncleVasya|> Historicaly happened (from early 90-s) that we're learning  Turbo Pascal 7.0
2012-02-17T12:23:12  <mcstar> mleise: btw, i found more readable to use 'and' 'or' and such in c++ too
2012-02-17T12:23:14  <|UncleVasya|> It has no use but there is no any work in moving to the new technologies in education.

2012-02-17T12:24:24  <mleise> |UncleVasya|: when I was at school in the 90s we had computers with Turbo Pascal and no hard disk in one room.
2012-02-17T12:24:51  <mcstar> booted from a 5.25 floppy
2012-02-17T12:24:52  <mleise> the lesson was over when they finished booting and loading TP from floppy disks
2012-02-17T12:25:24  <mleise> mcstar: no, D doesn't have words for operators except for 'in'.
2012-02-17T12:25:52  <mleise> and some people want to introduce 'and' and 'or' and 'not', but it would mess up the language if there were alternatives

2012-02-17T12:27:14  <mleise> I just use it to have a 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integer depending on architecture
2012-02-17T12:27:16  <mleise> yes
2012-02-17T12:27:37  <mleise> not really a typedef as in 'new type' though

2012-02-17T12:29:06  <|UncleVasya|> Teachers of many universities are too lazy to learn something new (and moving to something new also requires making new  documentation, new educational tasks collections etc). And System is too stupid to require from teachers such  moving.
2012-02-17T12:29:24  <mcstar> such change

2012-02-17T12:31:09  <|UncleVasya|> But again, some unies have teacher that not just gaining salary but really want to teach their students. In this case students learn c++, java, python, and only sometimes Pascal (when good teacher really think it is best tool for his cource).

2012-02-17T12:44:20  <mleise> My sister learned Java with a turtle library that wouldn't call System.exit and keep old instances running after the window was closed
2012-02-17T12:44:48  <mcstar> not a problem on a mainframe..
2012-02-17T12:45:24  <mleise> it just annoyed me like hell, that a teacher would spread such crap ware :p
2012-02-17T12:45:47  <mcstar> you now know better, but back then..
2012-02-17T12:46:12  <mcstar> i was excited when i got hold of a lot of expired chip magazin's cds
2012-02-17T12:46:38  <mcstar> you see, we could get a day off from school, if we went to an Info Expo or something
2012-02-17T12:47:06  <mcstar> and for a little fee, we could buy a lot of these magazines
2012-02-17T12:47:11  <mcstar> by the dozen
2012-02-17T12:47:57  <mcstar> those were filled with all kinds of shareware and demos
2012-02-17T12:47:58  <mleise> I remember downloading stuff at night with that loud 65k modem.
2012-02-17T12:48:10  <mcstar> load?
2012-02-17T12:48:10  <mleise> We used to be AOL clients
2012-02-17T12:48:14  <mcstar> loud?
2012-02-17T12:48:30  <mleise> loud, it made sounds when it connected
2012-02-17T12:48:37  <mcstar> sure, but not after
2012-02-17T12:48:47  <mleise> e.g. you could wake your parents with it
2012-02-17T12:48:55  <mcstar> there were modems that gave off sounds always
2012-02-17T12:49:03  <mcstar> while the connection lasted
2012-02-17T12:49:31  <mleise> lol, no need for the MP3 player on streaming radio, huh?
2012-02-17T12:49:51  <mcstar> on->or?
2012-02-17T12:50:39  <mcstar> today's trance music is fortunately much better than a dialing modem XD

2012-02-17T13:13:26  <mcstar> i wasnt listening to it for some time
2012-02-17T13:13:27  <rwest> I been paying for di.fm since before .fm
2012-02-17T13:13:34  <rwest> so many channels

2012-02-17T13:13:53  <rwest> just not 256k
2012-02-17T13:13:58  <mcstar> 96k
2012-02-17T13:14:00  <rwest> yea
2012-02-17T13:14:03  <mcstar> good enough for me
2012-02-17T13:14:14  <rwest> I listen for 10+ hours per day
2012-02-17T13:14:19  <rwest> worth it to pay for it
2012-02-17T13:14:27  <rwest> if not to just support them
2012-02-17T13:14:43  <mcstar> you are making a fortune, so you can afford it
2012-02-17T13:14:49  <mcstar> XD
2012-02-17T13:15:29  <mcstar> rwest: i just hated that i couldnt listen to something again, that i liked
2012-02-17T13:15:38  <rwest> paying you can
2012-02-17T13:15:40  <mcstar> so i started to download mixes instead

2012-02-17T13:16:04  <mcstar> anyway, i found xtc always better than di
2012-02-17T13:16:07  <rwest> nvm
2012-02-17T13:16:14  <rwest> that feature isn't what I thought it was lol
2012-02-17T13:16:15  <mcstar> i listened to them for a couple of years
2012-02-17T13:16:18  <mcstar> back at uni
2012-02-17T13:16:40  <rwest> I have never heard of them

2012-02-17T14:18:24  <mleise> 32k AAC+ sounds surprisingly good
2012-02-17T14:19:07  <mleise> when I saw a station with that bandwith i thought it was a joke, but I could listen to it (with laptop speakers at least)
2012-02-17T14:20:12  <mleise> I prefer rock songs, but I don't mind some ambient music (trance, lounge) inbetween
2012-02-17T14:20:55  <rwest> mleise: I listen to it more that it is background noise while coding

2012-02-17T14:24:39  <mcstar> why of course?
2012-02-17T14:24:47  <pairofdice> Try flac for some small filesizes
2012-02-17T14:24:54  <mleise> ever listened to music at 32k?
2012-02-17T14:25:19  <mleise> even mp3 or ogg which are good lossy codecs sound like crap at that bit rate :)
2012-02-17T14:25:22  <mcstar> at 32k what?

2012-02-17T14:25:35  <rwest> 256k ftw
2012-02-17T14:26:02  <mcstar> mleise: it depends how much frequency you want to cram in
2012-02-17T14:26:14  <mcstar> and all kinds of other factors
2012-02-17T14:26:22  <mcstar> bit rate alone doesnt mean everything

2012-02-17T14:27:01  <mleise> no... a sine wave probably sounds good at 32k :p

2012-02-17T14:31:35  <mcstar> how many times can a record be played wo noticeable damage in the music?
2012-02-17T14:32:03  <pairofdice> Depends on the amount of small children in the household

2012-02-17T15:43:08  <mleise> mcstar: lol, actually there are usb devices that can hack your computer, but the danger is of course that a user space program messes with the graphics card without the driver or writes to memory regions occupied by other processes
2012-02-17T15:45:13  <mleise> On Linux there are two gfx drivers: one for the console (during boot) and the one for the X Server. when both aren't from the same developer they may end up crashing your computer. So usually you use a plain VGA driver for the console and for example the proprietary nVidia driver for X
2012-02-17T15:45:29  <mleise> that is the same as the old user space can write to hardware problem, lifted to kernel space

2012-02-17T15:48:08  <mcstar> all i know is that the terminal-X change is better with the nouveau driver

2012-02-17T15:54:10  <mcstar> what about the radeon?
2012-02-17T15:54:16  <mcstar> is it any good?

2012-02-17T15:55:51  <mcstar> (i mean the opensource ati driver)
2012-02-17T15:56:04  <mcstar> ah, and ati is amd now isnt it?
2012-02-17T15:57:14  <rwest> mcstar: yes
2012-02-17T15:57:29  <rwest> and yes the radeon drivers suck

2012-02-17T15:58:02  <rwest> mcstar: don't think so
