2011-01-13T02:56:02  <jmcarthur> https://gist.github.com/777544
2011-01-13T02:56:47  <jmcarthur> just a simple map with two static (always visible) walls plus four (not always visible) walls created by the bikes
2011-01-13T02:57:30  <jmcarthur> the map needs a border, woops
2011-01-13T03:11:35  <jmcarthur> and here we are from one bot's point a view as we step through a few turns: https://gist.github.com/777556

2011-01-13T13:16:19  <McLeopold> okay, read that, I'll read the irc logs
2011-01-13T13:16:27  <McLeopold> what time was the discussion?
2011-01-13T13:16:49  <jmcarthur> i forget. my client died between then and now
2011-01-13T13:16:53  <jmcarthur> lemme check the logs

2011-01-13T13:18:47  <amstan_irssi> McLeopold: i know eh?
2011-01-13T13:18:50  <amstan_irssi> we fed the ants
2011-01-13T13:20:12  <McLeopold> what does feed ant's do?
2011-01-13T13:20:19  <jmcarthur> btw, the ant feeding has broken the endgame checker
2011-01-13T13:20:25  <jmcarthur> i tested it out last night
2011-01-13T13:21:22  <amstan_irssi> jmcarthur: yep.. i know, you just have to watch the images and kill it
2011-01-13T13:21:33  <amstan_irssi> jmcarthur: but then the makefile will remove the first image
2011-01-13T13:21:34  <amstan_irssi> and..
2011-01-13T13:21:35  <amstan_irssi> yeah..
2011-01-13T13:21:38  <amstan_irssi> it's messed up
2011-01-13T13:21:40  <jmcarthur> yeah that sucks :)
2011-01-13T13:21:41  <amstan_irssi> someone should fix it
2011-01-13T13:23:39  <jmcarthur> amstan_irssi: it's not quite right yet, but here's a few steps of the tron game (from the point of view of just one player) from when i was testing it out: https://gist.github.com/777556
2011-01-13T13:23:44  <McLeopold> haha, minecraft is sponge bob...  That's all I got out of the logs.
2011-01-13T13:23:52  <jmcarthur> amstan_irssi: i forgot to put borders around the map, and that's only 1v1 instead of 3v3
2011-01-13T13:24:06  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-01-13T13:24:30  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I like the outnumbering idea.  I think it is good.
2011-01-13T13:24:48  <McLeopold> It really changes the game.
2011-01-13T13:25:06  <amstan_irssi> outnumbering?
2011-01-13T13:25:21  <McLeopold> 2 ants beat 1 ant.  the 2 both remain.
2011-01-13T13:25:36  <amstan_irssi> does that happen yet?
2011-01-13T13:25:36  <amstan_irssi> lol
2011-01-13T13:25:41  <McLeopold> That might be tough to implement, though.
2011-01-13T13:25:53  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: your idea sounds kind of like king of the hill, but with multiple hills. am i understanding it right?
2011-01-13T13:26:00  <McLeopold> Yes.
2011-01-13T13:26:06  <jmcarthur> amstan_irssi: no, we're suggesting that it *should* happen
2011-01-13T13:26:13  <amstan_irssi> ok
2011-01-13T13:26:17  <jmcarthur> amstan_irssi: it would mean you have to have good micro
2011-01-13T13:26:55  <McLeopold> So, figuring out which ants should be removed would be like playing a game of minesweeper.
2011-01-13T13:26:57  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: does being near *any* hill give you points, or only your own?
2011-01-13T13:27:14  <McLeopold> Any hill, so you just need hills, not specific hills.
2011-01-13T13:27:26  <McLeopold> An you just need more than the leader to pull ahead or catch up.
2011-01-13T13:27:55  <amstan_irssi> well.. the repo is up, feel free to fork it, play with it
2011-01-13T13:28:24  <McLeopold> Okay, feel free to think about it and comment on it. ;)
2011-01-13T13:28:37  <amstan_irssi> i like it
2011-01-13T13:28:52  <jmcarthur> i'll be thinking about it too while i work on the tron game
2011-01-13T13:28:59  <jmcarthur> :P
2011-01-13T13:29:12  <jmcarthur> but really, i think we're getting some decent ideas now
2011-01-13T13:29:16  <amstan_irssi> yeah
2011-01-13T13:30:05  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: can an ant be a support to a fellow ant even if he is out of range of the attackers?
2011-01-13T13:30:07  <jmcarthur> i'm still uncertain about the more than two bots in a game thing
2011-01-13T13:30:17  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: you mean like making a chain of ants?
2011-01-13T13:30:22  <jmcarthur> i think that would make it too easy
2011-01-13T13:30:39  <jmcarthur> the largest force would always win by simply not breaking up
2011-01-13T13:30:45  <McLeopold> I'm thinking about how to implement the kill_ant() function.
2011-01-13T13:31:28  <McLeopold> For each ant, total the number of friendlies and enemies in a radius.  If e > f, then you live.
2011-01-13T13:31:36  <jmcarthur> for each ant, count the number of enemy ants and friendly ants in range. if enemies > friendlies, kill the ant
2011-01-13T13:31:39  <jmcarthur> haha!
2011-01-13T13:31:52  <McLeopold> So, the ant doesn't help itself then.
2011-01-13T13:32:11  <McLeopold> It doesn't count toward it's own friendly total?
2011-01-13T13:32:19  <jmcarthur> it should
2011-01-13T13:32:21  <jmcarthur> that was an error
2011-01-13T13:32:26  <jmcarthur> IMO
2011-01-13T13:32:45  <McLeopold> Okay, so then an ant can support a friendly even if out of range of the 2 enemy ants.
2011-01-13T13:32:55  <jmcarthur> i think this formulation though because it's kind of an automata thing
2011-01-13T13:33:01  <jmcarthur> *i think i like
2011-01-13T13:33:08  <jmcarthur> makes it easy to reason about
2011-01-13T13:33:17  <jmcarthur> okay i see what you mean now
2011-01-13T13:33:25  <jmcarthur> i think that's fine as long as it's not a recursive thing
2011-01-13T13:33:27  <McLeopold> yes, the simpler the rules, the best the contest
2011-01-13T13:34:36  <jmcarthur> in fact, that also makes the strategies kind of interesting. as long as it has backup you can attack with just one unit and only risk that unit

2011-01-13T13:35:18  <jmcarthur> but due to space concerns you can only provide so much backup, so it won't just turn into a bunch of 1v1 battles
2011-01-13T13:35:22  <McLeopold> There might be some ant formations that work well...
2011-01-13T13:35:28  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-13T13:35:51  <McLeopold> Like giant dense block that moves in the same direction.
2011-01-13T13:36:36  <McLeopold> Now it would be like the game of life.
2011-01-13T13:36:56  <jmcarthur> sort of... except that the things actually move rather than just spawn and die occasionally
2011-01-13T13:39:29  <McLeopold> It think if a bot got an advantage it could just bunch it's ants together and be fairly invulnerable.  It which case you may need hills to make an incentive for not bunching.
2011-01-13T13:40:02  <amstan_irssi> oh man.. ant formations!! lol
2011-01-13T13:40:06  <amstan_irssi> this will be so epic

2011-01-13T13:43:13  <McLeopold> amstan_irssi: are you a chat bot?  because you're slightly irrelevant right now.
2011-01-13T13:43:52  <amstan_irssi> lol, sorry
2011-01-13T13:43:56  <McLeopold> :)
2011-01-13T13:45:27  <McLeopold> With PlanetWars, you had to balance your initial neutral acquisition with your defense.  Grow to fast and you are defenseless.  Grow to slow and you will be behind.  You had to react to the opponent.
2011-01-13T13:45:40  <McLeopold> An Ant game will need a similar balance to be fun.

2011-01-13T15:55:04  <Cyndre> like that hn article earlier this week about 8x8 pixel blocks
2011-01-13T15:56:10  <jmcarthur> resolution?
2011-01-13T15:59:57  <Cyndre> size of building bricks
2011-01-13T16:00:04  <Cyndre> by making them smaller it would increase the resolution of the game

2011-01-13T21:44:00  <amstan> pgpaskar_: idk, i kinda like the gfx
2011-01-13T21:45:04  <pgpaskar_> That doesn't mean it couldn't use an improvement
2011-01-13T21:46:58  <amstan> and there's already texture packers out there

2011-01-13T22:18:43  <antimatroid> pretty sure we would have been alright where we were, just stuck there :)
2011-01-13T22:19:09  <antimatroid> and possibly not with a dry tent inside
2011-01-13T22:22:06  <dmj111> I just skimmed that acm thing.  looks kind of neat.  good to see these kinds of things in more places.
2011-01-13T22:23:45  <antimatroid> amstan: what is wrong with the home base invasion to win idea for ants? it adds another layer to the strategies people need to employ
2011-01-13T22:24:13  <antimatroid> dmj111: i think i might at least have a play with the acm game
2011-01-13T22:25:14  <dmj111> i am going to look at it a little closer.  too many fun things to do.  "but its a learning experience", i keep telling myself, "not a game!"
2011-01-13T22:25:48  <antimatroid> they've already disheartened me on the first line
2011-01-13T22:25:59  <antimatroid> who the hell indexes grids x y instead of row col

2011-01-13T22:31:43  <antimatroid> it was right handed, but take your normal xyz 3d system indexed with (x,y,z), he would use (x,z,y) with y being the vertically drawn line, z being the horizontal one and x the nomal diagonal one
2011-01-13T22:32:13  <antimatroid> it would be annoying as hell if we met up with aliens and they had left handed coordinates

2011-01-13T22:32:57  <antimatroid> if you draw a 3d system on a 2d page, you're going to need a diagonal line somewhere

2011-01-13T22:34:06  <antimatroid> i didn't do top physics or chemistry

2011-01-13T22:34:19  <antimatroid> which was like half physics half chemistry
2011-01-13T22:34:26  <antimatroid> so i did a little bit, but the maths was minimal

2011-01-13T22:37:26  <antimatroid> you make snowballs of different sizes, try to make snowmen, crush snowballs, place them down etc. etc.
2011-01-13T22:37:38  <antimatroid> i haven't quite got to the point where they describe the actual objective yet

2011-01-13T23:41:17  <antimatroid> you get scores based on your domain (field of vision) which is based off what your kids and snowmen can see, and for hitting them with snowballs
2011-01-13T23:41:38  <antimatroid> movement is more complicated than necessary, but whatever
2011-01-13T23:41:52  <sigh> hmm... i see
