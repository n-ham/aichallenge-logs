2012-08-19T08:09:34  <mleise> mcstar: I watched Prometheus yesterday. It was a good watch, but is has the same problem as Matrix: How can the alien baby grow that much in an empty room? What did it feed on? If that albino freak is genetically a human being, how does it not die in the toxic atmosphere when it hunts down the last survivor in the survival pod?
2012-08-19T08:10:23  <mcstar> erm
2012-08-19T08:10:26  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-19T08:10:38  <mcstar> i can point out your mistake
2012-08-19T08:10:49  <mcstar> let me finish something
2012-08-19T08:10:49  <mleise> They have probably cut out a few scenes as well, like the one from the preview "why is that door open"
2012-08-19T08:11:35  <mleise> mcstar: mistake in my logic? i'm curious. unless you say my expectation on the movie was too high to begin with ^^
2012-08-19T08:18:32  <mcstar> mleise: first and foremost i was very disappointed in that movie
2012-08-19T08:18:57  <mcstar> couple of days ago i watched Alien and Aliens btw
2012-08-19T08:19:21  <mcstar> your first mistake, is that the same thing happens in those movies: the creatures grow wo eating!
2012-08-19T08:19:32  <pairofdice> Yup, which I find very strange
2012-08-19T08:19:43  <mcstar> yes me too
2012-08-19T08:19:59  <mcstar> but the movies are great, and after a little while, i didnt mind
2012-08-19T08:20:18  <mcstar> those 2 movies are near perfect
2012-08-19T08:20:20  <mleise> wowowow, wait. in alien 1 the creature was roaming freely
2012-08-19T08:20:29  <mcstar> really, the stage, the acting, the athmosphere..
2012-08-19T08:20:30  <mleise> it could eat cats, food rations etc
2012-08-19T08:20:41  <mcstar> no
2012-08-19T08:20:44  <mcstar> it didnt eat shit
2012-08-19T08:20:51  <mcstar> the creature left john hurt
2012-08-19T08:20:54  <mcstar> they let it go
2012-08-19T08:21:02  <mleise> and then it ate
2012-08-19T08:21:03  <mcstar> and couldnt eat anything
2012-08-19T08:21:17  <mleise> it ate cereals and honey and milk
2012-08-19T08:21:26  <mcstar> when the mechanic met him, it was full-grown
2012-08-19T08:21:42  <mcstar> the 'right' man
2012-08-19T08:21:47  <mcstar> that always said right..
2012-08-19T08:21:59  <mleise> oh i watched it in german
2012-08-19T08:22:20  <mleise> guess i missed out on that
2012-08-19T08:22:28  <mcstar> oh, i got to go have lunch
2012-08-19T08:22:33  <mcstar> ill be back like terminator
2012-08-19T08:27:52  <mleise> some people also suggest that the alien fed on inedible ship interiors, like glass or similar to build their silicon exosceleton.
2012-08-19T08:28:34  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-19T08:29:02  <mcstar> pure speculation
2012-08-19T08:29:13  <mcstar> there is no clue as to what do xenomorphs eat
2012-08-19T08:29:29  <pairofdice> Also the drool all the time
2012-08-19T08:29:34  <pairofdice> How do they keep that up
2012-08-19T08:29:36  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-19T08:29:51  <mcstar> when they are not being filmed, they dont drool
2012-08-19T08:30:03  <mcstar> anyway, noone said they have a silicon exoskeleton
2012-08-19T08:30:28  <mcstar> its the headgrabber that built up silicon in its system
2012-08-19T08:31:21  <mcstar> the xenomorph's teeth look like metal scales btw
2012-08-19T08:32:08  <mcstar> mleise: let me read your second objection, im sure i can explain it
2012-08-19T08:32:41  <mleise> hopefully better than the first
2012-08-19T08:32:49  <mcstar> hm?
2012-08-19T08:33:14  <mcstar> that movie has much bigger problems than those
2012-08-19T08:33:31  <mcstar> where did you watch it btw?
2012-08-19T08:33:53  <mleise> in the Kammerlichtspiele Celle
2012-08-19T08:34:10  <mcstar> is that a cinema?
2012-08-19T08:34:16  <mleise> a small local cinema. the picture was a bit blurry, but in 3d
2012-08-19T08:34:37  <mcstar> i read that the visuals and the 3d experience is great
2012-08-19T08:34:44  <mcstar> however bad the plot is...
2012-08-19T08:35:21  <mcstar> mleise: do you mean Shaw's 'child'?
2012-08-19T08:35:32  <mleise> yes, altough i noticed the human perception is in trouble in the sand storm scene. the images change to fast and there is the problem of missing depth sharpness.
2012-08-19T08:35:36  <mcstar> the squid like creature?
2012-08-19T08:35:47  <mleise> mcstar: yes, the squid grew like it ate a cow or two
2012-08-19T08:36:02  <mcstar> im focusing on your second objection...
2012-08-19T08:36:31  <mcstar> mleise: can you refresh my memories of that scene?
2012-08-19T08:36:49  <mcstar> i dont remember it hunting down the 'last survivor' of a pod
2012-08-19T08:36:55  <mleise> ok, Swan fled from the crashing alien ship into the safety pod
2012-08-19T08:36:58  <mcstar> i remember it killing the Engineer
2012-08-19T08:37:17  <mcstar> that was miss. Vickers' pod
2012-08-19T08:37:23  <mleise> then the head of the android contacted her and told her that the alien was after her
2012-08-19T08:37:34  <mcstar> no
2012-08-19T08:37:36  <mcstar> not alien
2012-08-19T08:37:37  <mleise> in this moment it came through the door, actually tearing it almost apart
2012-08-19T08:37:39  <mcstar> Engineer
2012-08-19T08:37:45  <mleise> well the ... yes Engineer
2012-08-19T08:37:52  <mcstar> the big humanoid
2012-08-19T08:37:56  <mleise> they labeled them Creator in the translation
2012-08-19T08:38:03  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-19T08:38:33  <mcstar> but the squid was in the escape pod
2012-08-19T08:38:46  <mcstar> i think it tried to attack Swan
2012-08-19T08:38:49  <mcstar> Shawn
2012-08-19T08:39:17  <mcstar> no, Shaw, no n
2012-08-19T08:39:21  <mcstar> i think
2012-08-19T08:39:23  <mcstar> anyway
2012-08-19T08:39:31  <mcstar> i think it tried to attack her, grabbed her foot or something
2012-08-19T08:39:51  <mcstar> when came the engineer, she opened the door, and the squid grabbed the engineer
2012-08-19T08:39:59  <mcstar> and shaw got out
2012-08-19T08:40:05  <mcstar> btw, i liked that scnene
2012-08-19T08:40:15  <mcstar> the struggle between the two
2012-08-19T08:41:00  <mcstar> i dont see a problem with the athmosphere there
2012-08-19T08:41:17  <mcstar> and why wouldnt it be breathable for the squid?
2012-08-19T08:41:33  <mcstar> just because it contains shaw's dna?
2012-08-19T08:41:43  <mcstar> not a strong argument i think
2012-08-19T08:42:38  <mleise> wut?
2012-08-19T08:42:52  <mleise> I meant the Engineer
2012-08-19T08:43:00  <mleise> how could it breathe outsides
2012-08-19T08:43:50  <mleise> It came in without it's suit
2012-08-19T08:44:27  <mleise> btw the suit reminded me much of the Predator and the alien reminded me of the Alien
2012-08-19T08:44:28  <mcstar> "If that albino freak is genetically a human being"
2012-08-19T08:44:33  <mcstar> i thought you meant the squid
2012-08-19T08:45:18  <mcstar> actually, there might not be much genetic connection between humans and the engineers
2012-08-19T08:45:25  <mcstar> they seeded life on earth
2012-08-19T08:45:30  <mcstar> but not human life
2012-08-19T08:45:31  <mcstar> life
2012-08-19T08:45:43  <mcstar> so we evolved from those fragmants
2012-08-19T08:45:58  <mcstar> and we could have ended up quite different from their dna
2012-08-19T08:46:21  <mcstar> probably humans are much much closer genetically to the squid than to the engineer
2012-08-19T08:47:08  <mleise> If I'm not mistaken, they compared the DNA from the decapitated Engineer with human DNA and got a 100% match
2012-08-19T08:47:33  <mleise> That in turn means that they need to breathe the same atmosphere, which they created in their base on that planet
2012-08-19T08:47:56  <mcstar> hm
2012-08-19T08:48:00  <mcstar> good point
2012-08-19T08:48:08  <mcstar> i would say thats the flaw
2012-08-19T08:48:29  <mleise> right
2012-08-19T08:48:43  <mcstar> theres 1.5 billion years of evolutino between humans and engineers
2012-08-19T08:48:59  <mleise> who said that?
2012-08-19T08:49:05  <mcstar> i say that
2012-08-19T08:49:09  <mleise> -.-
2012-08-19T08:49:13  <mcstar> what?
2012-08-19T08:49:21  <mcstar> remember how the film started?
2012-08-19T08:49:26  <mleise> the oldest paintings dated back 35,000 years they said
2012-08-19T08:49:30  <mcstar> on an empty planet, an engineer drunk something
2012-08-19T08:49:40  <mleise> yes
2012-08-19T08:49:40  <mcstar> his dna broke down, and seeded life
2012-08-19T08:49:53  <mleise> uh that scene puzzled me
2012-08-19T08:50:05  <mcstar> now life started 1.5 billion years ago on earth
2012-08-19T08:50:28  <mcstar> there is this disconnect of time scales
2012-08-19T08:50:45  <mcstar> the same engineer seeded life a massively long time ago
2012-08-19T08:50:49  <mleise> so was that planet in the beginning meant to be earth or what?
2012-08-19T08:51:09  <mcstar> and the same engineer tried to annihilate earth couple of thousand years ago
2012-08-19T08:51:27  <mcstar> (and their ship looked more advanced way back than in the recent past)
2012-08-19T08:51:38  <mcstar> not necessairly earth though
2012-08-19T08:51:50  <mcstar> but it hints at the fact, that they did the same to earth
2012-08-19T08:52:42  <mcstar> mleise: and there is this: the squid that came from Shaw, is like a head-grabber, it impregnates the engineer
2012-08-19T08:53:02  <mcstar> but all the xenimorphs that came from any other being are not able to procreate
2012-08-19T08:53:05  <mcstar> in this way
2012-08-19T08:53:15  <mcstar> only the queen could lay eggs
2012-08-19T08:53:21  <mcstar> from which the headgrabbers grew
2012-08-19T08:58:29  <mcstar> hm, they will release the film on dvd/blu ray on october, 8

2012-08-19T09:06:01  <mcstar> hm
2012-08-19T09:06:07  <mcstar> the first one is not lv-423
2012-08-19T09:06:14  <mcstar> lv-426 maybe
2012-08-19T09:06:29  <mcstar> same kind of ship*

2012-08-19T09:10:49  <mcstar> complete bullshit
2012-08-19T09:11:25  <mcstar> that doesnt explain anything, just states the well known plot
2012-08-19T09:11:49  <mleise> ...well it explains that the plot is bullshit
2012-08-19T09:12:04  <mleise> but the special effects were good
2012-08-19T09:12:14  <mcstar> unfortunately i didnt see those
2012-08-19T09:13:18  <mcstar> mleise: another problem is, why did the engineers tell mankind the location of one of their military bases?

2012-08-19T09:17:44  <mcstar> i thought about wathing that
2012-08-19T09:17:55  <mcstar> ive seen 1 and 2 i think, a long time ago
2012-08-19T09:18:08  <mcstar> i wondered how ass-kicking mila yovovich is
2012-08-19T09:18:28  <mleise> but yea, their ships on the military outpost didn't look like they carried any weapons, and they had trouble controlling their only real weapon there
2012-08-19T09:18:52  <mleise> that's not a good start to lay out a trap
2012-08-19T09:20:37  <mcstar> there is another hole

2012-08-19T09:21:32  <mcstar> did she have psichic abilities?

2012-08-19T10:33:31  <mcstar> when thestinger comes, ill tell him zsh sucks
2012-08-19T10:33:52  <mcstar> first i tried to add a new Konsole profile, with zsh, well, thats what crashed it
2012-08-19T10:34:07  <mcstar> and home/end/delete doesnt work in zsh
2012-08-19T10:34:32  <mcstar> (i hope it is clear that i mean ^^ as a humorous comment...)

2012-08-19T10:49:15  <mleise> mcstar: standing against a wall? ^^
2012-08-19T10:49:22  <mcstar> though, i doesnt sounds nearly as impressive when i tell you i didnt do it all at once
2012-08-19T10:49:25  <mcstar> it*
2012-08-19T10:50:09  <mcstar> the first 300 i did by 20, i frequently stood up from the computer and did them
2012-08-19T10:50:24  <mcstar> the last 100 i did in a short time
2012-08-19T10:50:28  <mcstar> that almost killed me
2012-08-19T10:51:07  <mleise> I can't do that anymore. I used to do 100 when I was a child.
2012-08-19T10:51:45  <mcstar> all you need is a little practice
2012-08-19T10:53:36  <mleise> In any case it is a respectable count :)

2012-08-19T12:01:06  <thestinger> mcstar: why?
2012-08-19T12:01:17  <thestinger> I can't think of a single thing bash does better :P
2012-08-19T12:01:17  <mcstar> it crashed my Konsole!
2012-08-19T12:01:21  <thestinger> mcstar: wat
2012-08-19T12:01:36  <mcstar> i was trying to add a new profile to Konsole, but it crashed
2012-08-19T12:01:49  <mcstar> just after i tryped /bin/zsh into the profile
2012-08-19T12:01:55  <mcstar> typed*
2012-08-19T12:01:58  <thestinger> doesn't seem related to zsh :P
2012-08-19T12:02:02  <mcstar> i know
2012-08-19T12:02:03  <thestinger> just chsh -s /bin/zsh
2012-08-19T12:02:11  <thestinger> and be cool and use termite
2012-08-19T12:02:13  <mcstar> but still, it is one reason it sucks
2012-08-19T12:02:19  <mcstar> i have another
2012-08-19T12:02:26  <mcstar> home/end/delete doesnt work

2012-08-19T12:02:41  <mcstar> haha
2012-08-19T12:02:46  <mcstar> ok, but still
2012-08-19T12:02:48  <mcstar> let me finish
2012-08-19T12:02:51  <thestinger> at least in vi mode
2012-08-19T12:02:58  <mcstar> and it sucks because of its name
2012-08-19T12:03:16  <mcstar> zhong shao? or what was the person called the shell is named after?
2012-08-19T12:03:19  <mcstar> how lame is that?
2012-08-19T12:03:28  <thestinger> mcstar: just be lazy and install grml-zsh-config to start off with
2012-08-19T12:03:32  <thestinger> the default config sucks
2012-08-19T12:03:44  <mcstar> :(
2012-08-19T12:03:46  <thestinger> doesn't have the nice completion enabled, etc
2012-08-19T12:03:50  <thestinger> or copy stuff from my config
2012-08-19T12:03:51  <mcstar> i didnt come across the way i wanted..
2012-08-19T12:04:07  <mcstar> i wanted to tell you some asinie reason why zsh sucks
2012-08-19T12:04:14  <thestinger> mcstar: I know :P
2012-08-19T12:04:18  <mcstar> but you are actually trying to help me
2012-08-19T12:04:18  <thestinger> I'm in a crappy mood atm
2012-08-19T12:04:22  <thestinger> my laptop's screen is fucked
2012-08-19T12:04:30  <thestinger> it's blue.
2012-08-19T12:04:34  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-19T12:04:40  <mcstar> meaning, it is sad?
2012-08-19T12:04:42  <thestinger> everything is blue
2012-08-19T12:04:44  <thestinger> pretty much
2012-08-19T12:04:52  <thestinger> it seems some of the columns of pixels have decided to go on vacation
2012-08-19T12:05:01  <mcstar> your laptop is sad, buy her some icecream
2012-08-19T12:05:05  <thestinger> so along with leaving black stripes down the screen, it's blue
2012-08-19T12:05:23  <mcstar> what model?
2012-08-19T12:05:29  <mcstar> i bet it is alienware
2012-08-19T12:05:31  <thestinger> thinkpad t530
2012-08-19T12:05:36  <thestinger> probably a loose cable.
2012-08-19T12:05:37  <mcstar> so close XD
2012-08-19T12:05:50  <thestinger> have to pick one of their partners in toronto and drive there
2012-08-19T12:07:07  <mcstar> thestinger: i dont understand one thing, in bash (~) . .bashrc works, but no in zsh, . .zsh
2012-08-19T12:07:14  <mcstar> not*
2012-08-19T12:07:29  <mcstar> why cant it find a file in the current directory?
2012-08-19T12:07:39  <mcstar> .zshrc
2012-08-19T12:07:58  <thestinger> mcstar: source .zshrc or . ./zshrc will work
2012-08-19T12:08:05  <mcstar> i know
2012-08-19T12:08:10  <mcstar> doesnt answer my quesiton
2012-08-19T12:08:46  <thestinger> mcstar: dunno
2012-08-19T12:08:47  <mcstar> but clearly, this is an incompatibility between zsh and bash
2012-08-19T12:08:54  <thestinger> mcstar: there are several
2012-08-19T12:08:58  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-19T12:09:01  <thestinger> there are config settings to make it more compatible
2012-08-19T12:09:13  <thestinger> (for example it has an emulate sh mode)
2012-08-19T12:09:28  <mcstar> thestinger: is zsh usually installed on linux/unix/osx?
2012-08-19T12:09:49  <thestinger> mcstar: installed by default on os x
2012-08-19T12:10:08  <thestinger> it's not GPL licensed so the BSDs like it a bit more, but they usually use ksh or similar as their default for some reaosn
2012-08-19T12:10:29  <mcstar> yeah, but is it installed?
2012-08-19T12:10:40  <mcstar> not very important, i am just curious
2012-08-19T12:10:54  <thestinger> mcstar: on os x yes
2012-08-19T12:11:04  <mcstar> afaik on linux distros it is not installed by default
2012-08-19T12:11:11  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah, bash is
2012-08-19T12:11:14  <thestinger> dunno about others, I don't think most bsds come with either zsh or bash
2012-08-19T12:13:37  <mcstar> hm, arch/core has dash
2012-08-19T12:14:01  <thestinger> mcstar: ah, figured out why
2012-08-19T12:14:18  <thestinger> . searches $PATH if you don't give a path
2012-08-19T12:14:27  <thestinger> source searches current dir
2012-08-19T12:14:52  <mcstar> aha
2012-08-19T12:19:09  <mleise> how do i enable ctrl+left in zshß
2012-08-19T12:19:11  <mleise> ?
2012-08-19T12:19:19  <mcstar> CD
2012-08-19T12:19:21  <mcstar> DC
2012-08-19T12:19:33  <mleise> direct current?
2012-08-19T12:19:39  <thestinger> mleise: well the good way is to find the terminfo name
2012-08-19T12:20:07  <mcstar> in weechat i cant use ctrl+left/right
2012-08-19T12:20:22  <mcstar> or maybe i solved it idk
2012-08-19T12:20:30  <mcstar> in zsh+weechat it is not working
2012-08-19T12:20:32  <mcstar> i get C and D
2012-08-19T12:20:46  <mcstar> but konsole adds another layer of complexity i think
2012-08-19T12:20:50  <thestinger> mcstar: ctrl-left/right work here in weechat
2012-08-19T12:20:54  <thestinger> mleise: is shift-left okay? :P
2012-08-19T12:21:10  <mcstar> that switches between konsole tabs
2012-08-19T12:21:11  <thestinger> well you can do it via a control code binding anyway for ctrl-left
2012-08-19T12:21:11  <mleise> thestinger: seriously ? mmm, ok
2012-08-19T12:22:10  <mcstar> there is some emacs-like keybinding that works though
2012-08-19T12:22:20  <mcstar> meta-B and meta-p or something
2012-08-19T12:22:26  <mleise> I'll try this:
2012-08-19T12:22:27  <mleise> bindkey “;5D” backward-word
2012-08-19T12:22:27  <mleise>  bindkey “;5C” forward-wordbindkey
2012-08-19T12:24:21  <thestinger> mleise: http://sprunge.us/DbKQ for example with shift-left/right
2012-08-19T12:24:25  <mleise> why does that beep?
2012-08-19T12:24:45  <thestinger> mleise: do ctrl-v and then ctrl-left to get the escape code
2012-08-19T12:24:59  <mcstar> alt-B alt-F
2012-08-19T12:25:01  <thestinger> or figure out what the terminfo name is (that's better because it's portable between terms)
2012-08-19T12:25:30  <mcstar> i like c-w, c-u, c-k
2012-08-19T12:25:53  <mcstar> i set emacs mode in my .inputrc
2012-08-19T12:26:06  <thestinger> mcstar: zsh doesn't use readline/inputrc
2012-08-19T12:26:14  <thestinger> it has it's own line editor that's nicer
2012-08-19T12:26:29  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-19T12:26:32  <thestinger> if you don't explicitly set vi or emacs mode it infers it from $EDITOR
2012-08-19T12:26:37  <thestinger> or falls back to emacs
2012-08-19T12:27:04  <mcstar> i think i kept EDITOR on vim
2012-08-19T12:27:16  <mcstar> but ofc, that was in .bashrc
2012-08-19T12:27:21  <mcstar> so now it is not set
2012-08-19T12:27:57  <mcstar> ill migrate my .bashrc
2012-08-19T12:28:09  <mcstar> later, probably
2012-08-19T12:28:23  <thestinger> you'll also want the basics like zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
2012-08-19T12:28:25  <mcstar> thestinger: i set the 'fire' prompt
2012-08-19T12:28:46  <thestinger> and loading complist, etc. for colors in completion
2012-08-19T12:29:05  <mcstar> thestinger: maybe ill read your .zshrc
2012-08-19T12:29:13  <thestinger> https://github.com/thestinger/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/zsh/.zshrc#L52 that stuff
2012-08-19T12:29:19  <mcstar> i know
2012-08-19T12:29:24  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-19T12:29:33  <thestinger> and the zmodload zsh/complist before it
2012-08-19T12:30:12  <mcstar> this is good, im eating stuffed eggplant
2012-08-19T12:31:00  <mcstar> thestinger: i have to confess something
2012-08-19T12:31:09  <mcstar> im using kde...
2012-08-19T12:31:18  <thestinger> I know :P
2012-08-19T12:31:26  <mcstar> how?
2012-08-19T12:31:34  <mcstar> did you hack my screen?
2012-08-19T12:31:37  <thestinger> well I know you like KDE applications
2012-08-19T12:31:45  <thestinger> I don't know if you're using kwin though
2012-08-19T12:31:50  <mcstar> well, konsole and dolphin
2012-08-19T12:31:57  <mcstar> mostly konsole
2012-08-19T12:32:05  <mcstar> but now im under full kde
2012-08-19T12:32:08  <thestinger> termite is better :P
2012-08-19T12:32:33  <mcstar> i need session restore, im working with a lot of open documents
2012-08-19T12:32:41  <mcstar> and i want them opened the next time i log in
2012-08-19T12:32:54  <thestinger> mcstar: you can still use i3 as the wm in kde
2012-08-19T12:32:57  <mcstar> i set up a nice environment though
2012-08-19T12:33:00  <mcstar> no
2012-08-19T12:33:05  <mcstar> i want kwin if im in kde
2012-08-19T12:33:41  <mcstar> they added osx like shortcuts for switching between the windows of an application
2012-08-19T12:33:59  <mcstar> and the present window effects are quite fast, even with  my integratd vide
2012-08-19T12:34:10  <mcstar> and there is a better taskbar now
2012-08-19T12:34:20  <mcstar> so, 4.9 is quite good
2012-08-19T12:34:30  <mcstar> and otherwise very stable, except that 1 konsole crash
2012-08-19T12:58:58  <mcstar> thestinger: are the {{{}}} comments for vim?
2012-08-19T12:59:07  <mcstar> some directive?
2012-08-19T12:59:08  <thestinger> mcstar: yes
2012-08-19T12:59:11  <thestinger> code folding
2012-08-19T12:59:15  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-19T13:00:14  <thestinger> I also have stuff in zprofile/zshenv though

2012-08-19T13:04:47  <mcstar> he is right

2012-08-19T13:05:10  <mcstar> i.e. the existing ways are probably more natural
2012-08-19T13:05:34  <mcstar> thestinger: which channel?
2012-08-19T13:05:40  <thestinger> mcstar: not a public one
2012-08-19T13:05:44  <mcstar> ok

2012-08-19T13:11:14  <mcstar> thestinger: why yell?
2012-08-19T13:11:22  <mcstar> just stoke him

2012-08-19T13:12:08  <mcstar> lighttable is not better than emacs
2012-08-19T13:12:23  <mcstar> the current lighttable probably sucks big balls
2012-08-19T13:13:05  <mcstar> for code editing, lighttable or something similar can be and probably will be better than emacs
2012-08-19T13:13:15  <mcstar> there is a similar haskell effort
2012-08-19T13:13:20  <mcstar> called bottle
2012-08-19T13:13:28  <mcstar> i tried that too
2012-08-19T13:13:52  <mcstar> https://github.com/Peaker/bottle
2012-08-19T13:14:20  <mcstar> ive been toying with a similar idea myself too
2012-08-19T13:14:34  <mcstar> but it wont be a 'structural editor'
2012-08-19T13:14:39  <mcstar> i have more grandiouse plans
2012-08-19T13:14:53  <thestinger> a mind reading editor?
2012-08-19T13:15:00  <mcstar> haha. no
2012-08-19T13:15:17  <mcstar> code editing would be one facet of it
2012-08-19T13:15:38  <mcstar> but the main feature would be to provide an interactive scientific notebook
2012-08-19T13:16:05  <mcstar> it would require a tablet
2012-08-19T13:16:29  <mcstar> i think theres a whole lot of places where editors can go
2012-08-19T13:16:37  <mcstar> we havent seen the half of it
2012-08-19T13:16:59  <mcstar> but sometimes, you just want to write text
2012-08-19T13:17:27  <mcstar> if you know what you want to write, and dont need any kind of help, emacs is enough
2012-08-19T13:17:36  <mcstar> lol, even notepad

2012-08-19T13:33:00  <thestinger> mcstar: he hates clojure and haskell too
2012-08-19T13:33:10  <thestinger> he also thinks static typing is evil, and math is stupid
2012-08-19T13:33:14  <thestinger> I don't think you'd like him
2012-08-19T13:33:28  <mcstar> no, i dont think either...
2012-08-19T13:33:43  <thestinger> he claims he can learn everything taught to a math major over their uni education in a week
2012-08-19T13:33:52  <thestinger> oh well
2012-08-19T13:34:13  <mcstar> that is obviously bullshit
2012-08-19T13:34:27  <mcstar> you need time to understand stuff
2012-08-19T13:34:46  <mcstar> it isnt enough to read about something, you dont truly understand it until you use it
2012-08-19T13:34:56  <mcstar> and that takes time
2012-08-19T13:35:06  <mcstar> there is a great quote about this
2012-08-19T13:35:23  <mcstar> i hear it and i forget it; i see it and i remember; i do it and i understand
2012-08-19T13:36:28  <mcstar> thestinger: you could ask him, well, didnt you have a spare week then?
2012-08-19T13:54:54  <thestinger> mcstar: can't be reasoned with

2012-08-19T15:53:06  <mcstar> thestinger: eh, i got used to that bash doesnt cycle on tab between possible completions, what can i do to accept a completion and complete the inner directory?
2012-08-19T15:53:41  <thestinger> well zsh won't cycle on the first tab if it's ambiguous
2012-08-19T15:53:43  <thestinger> it will list them
2012-08-19T15:53:49  <thestinger> and then tab/shift-tab cycle and arrow keys work too
2012-08-19T15:54:03  <thestinger> mcstar: you mean /foo/bar<TAB>/trailing/stuff
2012-08-19T15:54:31  <mcstar> like foo/bar1,bar2
2012-08-19T15:54:40  <mcstar> under foo, there is bar1 bar2
2012-08-19T15:54:54  <mcstar> zsh keeps cycling between the two
2012-08-19T15:55:14  <mcstar> and i cant go on, for completing the inner directories/files
2012-08-19T15:55:38  <thestinger> mcstar: enter
2012-08-19T15:55:49  <thestinger> ctrl-c to cancel completion totally
2012-08-19T15:55:53  <thestinger> (it won't cancel the command)
2012-08-19T15:56:06  <mcstar> erm, those dont work
2012-08-19T15:56:16  <mcstar> maybe im not clear on what i want
2012-08-19T15:56:51  <thestinger> mcstar: enter accepts the current completion
2012-08-19T15:56:54  <thestinger> and stops cycling
2012-08-19T15:57:22  <mcstar> first tab: if not unique, it wont get completed; second tab: the possibilities get listed; 3rd tab: first choice gets completed; further tabs: cycling
2012-08-19T15:58:11  <mcstar> thestinger: enter accepts it, and executes the command, but thats not what i want, i want to acceppt the completion, and go on to complete on the next level

2012-08-19T16:00:33  <thestinger> there's setopt bashautolist
2012-08-19T16:00:33  <mcstar> i have a bare config only....
2012-08-19T16:00:36  <thestinger> mcstar: oh
2012-08-19T16:00:46  <thestinger> mcstar: first try
2012-08-19T16:00:52  <thestinger> zmodload zsh/complist
2012-08-19T16:00:56  <thestinger> zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
2012-08-19T16:01:06  <thestinger> and see if you like that
2012-08-19T16:01:32  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-19T16:01:36  <mcstar> ok, better
2012-08-19T16:02:06  <thestinger> setopt bashautolist makes it take two tabs at the start (I think)
2012-08-19T16:02:21  <thestinger> but it will just list and not complete if it's ambiguous
2012-08-19T16:02:24  <thestinger> without it
2012-08-19T16:02:37  <thestinger> and it will clear the completion menu if you choose not to tab again
2012-08-19T16:03:34  <mcstar> thestinger: thanks, this will be all right
2012-08-19T16:03:46  <thestinger> also

2012-08-19T17:28:15  <thestinger> you're pardoned
2012-08-19T17:28:35  <mcstar> no, i mean what should i be looking for?
2012-08-19T17:28:38  <mcstar> whats the problem?
2012-08-19T17:28:57  <thestinger> mcstar: that a character can be an arbitrary number of code points or bytes
2012-08-19T17:29:10  <thestinger> so strings in most languages are broken
2012-08-19T17:29:50  <mcstar> im too stupid to comprehend this issue, im sorry
2012-08-19T17:30:10  <mcstar> i simply cannot express how deeply i dont give a fuck about unicode and code points
2012-08-19T17:30:17  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-19T17:30:19  <thestinger> heh
2012-08-19T17:30:41  <mcstar> in all seriousness, i dont understand the issue
2012-08-19T17:35:21  <mcstar> thestinger: have you tried fish?
2012-08-19T17:35:26  <thestinger> yes
2012-08-19T17:35:39  <thestinger> it's okay, the new fork seems good
2012-08-19T17:36:13  <thestinger> but parsing man pages doesn't really give the same quality as handwritten completion
2012-08-19T17:36:20  <thestinger> and zsh has other features not in fish
2012-08-19T17:36:39  <thestinger> fish is more forward-looking though so maybe it will pull ahead
2012-08-19T17:37:05  <mcstar> "Finally, a command line shell for the 90s"
2012-08-19T17:37:07  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-19T17:37:33  <thestinger> the arch linux iso actually ships with zsh by default now
2012-08-19T17:37:47  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-19T17:37:51  <mcstar> i wouldnt know
2012-08-19T17:37:56  <mcstar> i installed this years ago
2012-08-19T17:38:19  <thestinger> it's nicer now, the installer is gone
2012-08-19T17:38:31  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-08-19T17:38:32  <mleise> you are still discussing zsh?
2012-08-19T17:38:34  <thestinger> there's just a script that bootstraps pacman (pacstrap)
2012-08-19T17:38:37  <mcstar> mleise: yes!
2012-08-19T17:38:52  <mcstar> thestinger: so no more ncurses config?
2012-08-19T17:38:55  <mcstar> i loved that
2012-08-19T17:38:57  <thestinger> mcstar: no more ncurses :P
2012-08-19T17:39:11  <mcstar> reminded me to the old way of kernel configuration
2012-08-19T17:39:19  <thestinger> now just partition/format, arch-chroot and pacstrap
2012-08-19T17:39:57  <mcstar> fish uses a cutting-edge technology known as "threads," so it doesn't stutter even on sluggish filesystems.
2012-08-19T17:43:53  <mleise> wtf are you smoking guys?
2012-08-19T17:44:27  <mcstar> mleise: hey! i dont waste it by smoking it! i eat it!
2012-08-19T17:44:43  <mleise> is this 'fish' an actual program to install or what?
2012-08-19T17:44:52  <mcstar> its a shell
2012-08-19T17:45:06  <mcstar> which is quite obvious, since it ends with sh
2012-08-19T17:45:13  <mleise> in deed " fish is the Friendly Interactive SHell"
2012-08-19T17:45:41  <mleise> now the question is, are shells fish?
2012-08-19T17:45:51  <mleise> and what is a shellfish?
2012-08-19T17:46:57  <mcstar> do you keep starfish on the selfish shelf?

2012-08-19T17:50:06  <mleise> i was looking what lies beyond 'bash'

2012-08-19T17:50:26  <mcstar> yeah, lies
2012-08-19T17:51:09  <mleise> and people blogged about the qualities of zsh, so i tried it
2012-08-19T17:51:21  <mleise> but it was horrible to configure it until it was usable
2012-08-19T17:51:33  <mcstar> hm?
2012-08-19T17:51:34  <mleise> in a bash sense
2012-08-19T17:51:38  <mcstar> i almost did nothing to it
2012-08-19T17:51:39  <thestinger> it's not *that* bad :P
2012-08-19T17:51:41  <mcstar> and it is usable
2012-08-19T17:51:53  <thestinger> you just need to turn on menu complete and it's nicer than bash
2012-08-19T17:52:03  <mleise> like the history setting, ctrl+left/right colors etc.
2012-08-19T17:53:17  <thestinger> one day I'll remember how to use the fancy globbing without docs
2012-08-19T17:53:57  <thestinger> *(D.om[1,5]) for the 5 newest files for example...
2012-08-19T17:54:10  <mcstar> i hope i wont ever need to know that
2012-08-19T17:54:29  <thestinger> well I use some of them
2012-08-19T17:54:41  <thestinger> like *(@) for matching all symlinks, *(*) for executables
2012-08-19T17:54:49  <thestinger> *(/) for dirs
2012-08-19T17:54:50  <mleise> O.o
2012-08-19T17:55:09  <mleise> the high elvish of zsh
2012-08-19T17:55:27  <thestinger> *(.oL[1,3]) is the 3 smallest files
2012-08-19T17:55:32  <thestinger> you can mix them together too
2012-08-19T17:55:38  <thestinger> and ** makes it recursive
2012-08-19T17:55:39  <mcstar> click the file manager icon on the dock; navigate to the required directory; set file listing mode to details; set listing mode to 'by date'
2012-08-19T17:55:40  <mcstar> thats all
2012-08-19T17:55:46  <mcstar> what can be simpler than that?
2012-08-19T17:56:14  <mcstar> sorting mode*
2012-08-19T17:56:26  <thestinger> because that doesn't let you run a command on them
2012-08-19T17:56:41  <mcstar> ………
2012-08-19T17:57:27  <thestinger> a more useful example of a complicated feature is zmv :P
2012-08-19T17:57:36  <thestinger> for mass renames
2012-08-19T17:58:13  <mcstar> if something is complicated, i like to see first if it works
2012-08-19T17:58:23  <thestinger> zmv has a dry run switch
2012-08-19T17:58:34  <mcstar> thats good
2012-08-19T17:59:03  <mcstar> thestinger:  :(
2012-08-19T17:59:12  <thestinger> hmm? :P
2012-08-19T17:59:19  <mcstar> that come up at the end of my prompt
2012-08-19T17:59:26  <mcstar> i think it means the exit status
2012-08-19T17:59:31  <mcstar> not 0
2012-08-19T17:59:57  <mcstar> what a clever prompt...jesus christ
2012-08-19T18:00:29  <thestinger> I should start displaying the git branch in my prompt
2012-08-19T18:00:34  <thestinger> I always commit to the wrong branch
2012-08-19T18:00:59  <mleise> use Thunar from Xfce4 for mass renames!
2012-08-19T18:01:07  <thestinger> zmv is pretty damn nice
2012-08-19T18:01:30  <mcstar> what has got thunar to do with mass renames?

2012-08-19T18:09:07  <thestinger> Wildman: ants is over, next contest is still undecided
2012-08-19T18:09:18  <mcstar> for 3/4 year now
2012-08-19T18:09:20  <thestinger> although you can download the engine and try it
2012-08-19T18:09:27  <mcstar> Wildman: you can play your bot against the ones you can find on the net
2012-08-19T18:09:27  <thestinger> if it still works :P
2012-08-19T18:09:30  <mleise> but we are still holding out here
2012-08-19T18:09:57  <mleise> like three old men left in a ghost town with a lighthouse
2012-08-19T18:09:58  <Wildman> Ok thank's ;)

2012-08-19T18:12:52  * mcstar secretly hopes, that somebody will publish our conversations some day, he thinks the world would greatly benefit..
2012-08-19T18:13:18  <mcstar> actually, i feel like an animal in cage, that is being studied
2012-08-19T18:13:30  <mleise> i hope i'm not alive in the world that would benefit from our gossip
2012-08-19T18:13:40  <mcstar> there are 43 ppl connected, but 3 are talking, the others just watch us
2012-08-19T18:13:52  <mleise> oh right, now that you say it
2012-08-19T18:14:12  * mleise knocks on the suspicious reflective glass
2012-08-19T18:14:29  <mcstar> hehe
2012-08-19T18:15:27  <mleise> i was once drunk with a girl in a cellar and noticed a surveillance camera that was hidden between pipes on the ceiling
2012-08-19T18:15:53  <mleise> a strange guy there was stealing girls' trousers
2012-08-19T18:16:44  <mcstar> "was once drunk with a girl" << good for you
2012-08-19T18:17:05  <mcstar> i dont understand your last sentence
2012-08-19T18:17:16  <mcstar> stealing trousers? is that an aforizm?
2012-08-19T18:17:24  <mleise> the camera was installed there because trousers disappeared from that cellar
2012-08-19T18:17:35  <mleise> like a jeans
2012-08-19T18:18:18  <mleise> he was later caught on camera and ... actually i don't know what happened to him. he was a little simple minded
2012-08-19T18:18:56  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-19T18:19:01  <mcstar> so let me get this straight
2012-08-19T18:19:16  <mcstar> while you were doing nasty things to a girl in a cellar
2012-08-19T18:19:17  <mleise> but we two just laughed our asses of that night, and made faces
2012-08-19T18:19:26  <mcstar> some guy was stealing trousers
2012-08-19T18:19:33  <mcstar> maybe he stole yours too?
2012-08-19T18:19:44  <mleise> no the trousers were stolen earlier from some other girl
2012-08-19T18:19:52  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-19T18:20:00  <mcstar> must have been some expensive trousers
2012-08-19T18:20:07  <mcstar> to install a camera just for that
2012-08-19T18:20:21  <mleise> no, because the girls were scared
2012-08-19T18:20:48  <mleise> it was sort of a school
2012-08-19T18:20:51  <thestinger> maybe they were scared because someone was keeping them locked up in a cellar
2012-08-19T18:20:59  <mcstar> yeah, i would be scared to walk out on the streets in my undies
2012-08-19T18:21:51  <mcstar> thestinger: lol, so thats YOUR phantasm
2012-08-19T18:22:36  <mleise> Hey some stranger was lurking around where they put up their clothes to dry and stole trousers. That's reason enough to put up a camera.
2012-08-19T18:22:58  <thestinger> or the girl lost her pants and blamed it on an imaginary person :P
2012-08-19T18:23:08  <mcstar> Who are you? And where is my lower-case friend, MLeise?
2012-08-19T18:23:15  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-19T18:23:16  <mleise> or that, yes. but the jeans was later seen in his flat
2012-08-19T18:23:19  <mcstar> your name starts with ML

2012-08-19T18:23:55  <mcstar> or ML
2012-08-19T18:24:02  <mleise> oh, come on. that's far fetched
2012-08-19T18:24:07  <mcstar> what?
2012-08-19T18:24:09  <mleise> actually my acronym is MCL
2012-08-19T18:24:21  <mcstar> if you loved ML you would be happy to notice thats  your initials also

2012-08-19T18:30:08  <thestinger> daniel thompson micay
2012-08-19T18:30:09  <mleise> nooo lame name
2012-08-19T18:30:11  <mcstar> i dont follow
2012-08-19T18:30:18  <thestinger> micay was shortened from a ukrainian-jewish name
2012-08-19T18:30:33  <thestinger> because my grandfather needed to get into law school and they had quotas on jews
2012-08-19T18:30:42  <mcstar> oh, you are a secretly world-dominating jew?
2012-08-19T18:30:56  <thestinger> so google "daniel micay" (with the quotes)
2012-08-19T18:30:58  <thestinger> only me
2012-08-19T18:31:15  <mleise> i met a girl in a train once. her name was olga. she came from ukraine and when she moved to germany they told her she should change her name, because it sounds old.
2012-08-19T18:31:30  <thestinger> which means that someone made a google+ in my name, and I'm not happy about that :(
2012-08-19T18:32:22  <mcstar> thestinger: is micay that uniquq?
2012-08-19T18:32:25  <mcstar> unique
2012-08-19T18:32:27  <thestinger> mcstar: yup
2012-08-19T18:32:36  <mcstar> but you have a middle name
2012-08-19T18:32:36  <thestinger> people spell it wrong everywhere too
2012-08-19T18:32:40  <mleise> wow, you are even on the second page for watching a github repository O.o
2012-08-19T18:32:46  <thestinger> mcstar: my middle name is my mom's last name
2012-08-19T18:33:22  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-19T18:33:28  <mcstar> yeah it is a family name
2012-08-19T18:33:37  <mleise> so did you get Europa Universalis III to work with wine in the end, thestinger?
