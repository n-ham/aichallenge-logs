2011-01-10T07:54:31  <delt0r_> This is after atempting some JSON and other type formats for some work code btw
2011-01-10T08:10:01  <dmj111> i am on the fence about the format. If I recall, the idea was so game parameters could be passed to the bot.
2011-01-10T08:10:01  <dmj111> json/yaml may make that easier, but i am not sure it is worth the cost.
2011-01-10T08:10:01  <dmj111> if the target audience was more advanced, then sure.
2011-01-10T08:14:37  <delt0r_> I don't see how using plain simple text fields makes it harder

2011-01-10T08:15:28  <delt0r_> I add a game init record... or records..

2011-01-10T11:30:08  <jmcarthur> what's so much harder about json?
2011-01-10T11:30:19  <jmcarthur> i've used it before and it was pretty easy
2011-01-10T11:33:38  <jmcarthur> pretty much you just pass a string to a function and get back a data structure or pass a data structure to a function and get a string
2011-01-10T11:46:39  <delt0r> not really
2011-01-10T11:46:59  <delt0r> at least in java you need to have a good idea of the "type" before hand
2011-01-10T11:47:06  <delt0r> otherwise you get exceptions
2011-01-10T11:47:20  <jmcarthur> exceptions?
2011-01-10T11:47:20  <delt0r> or you are back at traversing a DOM type parse tree
2011-01-10T11:47:31  <delt0r> both don't seem like fun
2011-01-10T11:47:41  <jmcarthur> parsing is no more fun
2011-01-10T11:47:49  <delt0r> its plain trival
2011-01-10T11:47:55  <delt0r> without libarays
2011-01-10T11:47:58  <jmcarthur> and still requires traversing a parse tree
2011-01-10T11:48:02  <delt0r> why add something and get nothing bacl
2011-01-10T11:48:18  <delt0r> I don't traverse any parse tree
2011-01-10T11:48:23  <delt0r> its a few lines of code
2011-01-10T11:48:28  <delt0r> and its expandable
2011-01-10T11:48:35  <delt0r> and not extra 3rd party libs

2011-01-10T11:49:33  <jmcarthur> you must be using much harder json libraries and on much more complicated json than i am
2011-01-10T11:49:42  <delt0r> I tried googles one
2011-01-10T11:49:45  <delt0r> and 2 others
2011-01-10T11:49:49  <delt0r> all were the same
2011-01-10T11:50:01  <delt0r> since there is no real "type" info in a JSON format
2011-01-10T11:50:05  <jmcarthur> seriously, it's just a key-value store, which is fundamentally the same as our custom format except that it doesn't require you to write you own parser and supports more types of data
2011-01-10T11:50:23  <delt0r> I know what it is
2011-01-10T11:50:31  <delt0r> and after useing it
2011-01-10T11:50:43  <delt0r> I am against it...
2011-01-10T11:50:57  <jmcarthur> i just don't see how parsing is so much easier than querying a key-value mapping
2011-01-10T11:51:17  <delt0r> It really doesn't add anything--expect a lot of extra support for starter packages since getting libs to work will be a real hassel
2011-01-10T11:52:12  <jmcarthur> also, how does the map fit into all this? do you just require that it be at the end of everything?
2011-01-10T11:52:21  <delt0r> no
2011-01-10T11:52:23  <delt0r> what?

2011-01-10T11:52:30  <delt0r> what are you talking about>
2011-01-10T11:52:31  <delt0r> ?
2011-01-10T11:52:33  <jmcarthur> or give it its own key at the beginning o each row
2011-01-10T11:52:47  <jmcarthur> the map format is just a big chunk of text including newlines right now
2011-01-10T11:52:56  <delt0r> yea
2011-01-10T11:53:06  <delt0r> but was sugesting "records"
2011-01-10T11:53:17  <delt0r> lots of space catalogs have this type of thing
2011-01-10T11:53:19  <jmcarthur> so you propose we just stick a bunch of "m" keys at the beginning of each row of the map?
2011-01-10T11:53:24  <delt0r> works quite well
2011-01-10T11:53:44  <delt0r> a record starts with a char or whatever and tells you the format of the rest of the line
2011-01-10T11:53:52  <delt0r> ignore records you don't know about
2011-01-10T11:53:52  <jmcarthur> right. one line
2011-01-10T11:54:01  <jmcarthur> the map is more than one line
2011-01-10T11:54:13  <delt0r> have more that one map record
2011-01-10T11:54:21  <jmcarthur> okay that's all i was asking
2011-01-10T11:54:27  <jmcarthur> making sure i understood what you were getting at
2011-01-10T11:54:54  <jmcarthur> okay, so essentially, you're saying that a list of (char,string) pairs is better than a key-value mapping
2011-01-10T11:55:11  <delt0r> I just don't think using json + parsing libs adds anything
2011-01-10T11:55:18  <delt0r> not quite
2011-01-10T11:55:30  <delt0r> so in the last game
2011-01-10T11:55:33  <delt0r> we have fleets
2011-01-10T11:55:53  <delt0r> this was an "f" record... ie we now know the format of the rest of the line
2011-01-10T11:56:02  <delt0r> it can tell you anything.
2011-01-10T11:56:14  <jmcarthur> sure, but then you have to write a custom parser for it
2011-01-10T11:56:23  <jmcarthur> for every single type of record
2011-01-10T11:56:24  <delt0r> which is all of about 3 lines of code
2011-01-10T11:56:37  <delt0r> and does not require a 3rd party lib
2011-01-10T11:57:15  <delt0r> and is about the same amout of code as  JSON would give anyway
2011-01-10T11:57:55  <delt0r> since i will still either have to querry the "keys" or have a "class" that matches what the JSON object it
2011-01-10T11:57:56  <delt0r> is
2011-01-10T11:58:09  <jmcarthur> it depends on the format, but if your language makes JSON so difficult to use i doubt it would only be able to do this in only 3 lines of code without it
2011-01-10T11:58:20  <delt0r> I tried in 3 langs
2011-01-10T11:58:31  <delt0r> the different libs all behave differently
2011-01-10T11:58:47  <delt0r> pyton was the easiest
2011-01-10T11:58:50  <delt0r> C was the worst
2011-01-10T11:59:09  <delt0r> i mean C++
2011-01-10T11:59:52  <delt0r> but i am not a organizer... I am just voicing  my perhaps quite strong opinion...
2011-01-10T12:00:28  <delt0r> And i won't have to answer all the question about getting the starter packs going either... or why jsonXXX.lib is not supported
2011-01-10T12:01:03  <jmcarthur> the whole point of the starter packs is to work out of the box. they shouldn't require anything special on part of the end user
2011-01-10T12:01:31  <jmcarthur> that is, any necessary libs should be included with the starter pack
2011-01-10T12:01:36  <delt0r> If the have a non standard lib dependency... good luck with that...
2011-01-10T12:01:53  <delt0r> yea with linking and including and compiling...
2011-01-10T12:02:16  * janzert agrees with that the ease of parsing the ad-hoc format trumps the extensibility and portability of json in this case
2011-01-10T12:02:20  <jmcarthur> it's not hard to write a one-line makefile
2011-01-10T12:02:25  <jmcarthur> two-line
2011-01-10T12:02:30  <delt0r> we are talking about folk you trying to code for the first time
2011-01-10T12:02:58  <jmcarthur> people coding for the first time aren't going to care about the serialization format and aren't going to write their own starters
2011-01-10T12:03:00  <delt0r> the very idea of a linking step is not the same as a compiling step is a new concept
2011-01-10T12:03:08  <delt0r> not
2011-01-10T12:03:09  <delt0r> no
2011-01-10T12:03:18  <delt0r> but they will want to compile them
2011-01-10T12:03:23  <jmcarthur> "make"
2011-01-10T12:03:27  <delt0r> lol
2011-01-10T12:03:31  <jmcarthur> or whatever visual studio wants you to do
2011-01-10T12:03:42  <delt0r> as i said... good luck
2011-01-10T12:04:45  <jmcarthur> well, i can see that there is strong enough opposition that i'm not going to win this
2011-01-10T12:04:49  <jmcarthur> jeff is against it too
2011-01-10T12:04:56  <jmcarthur> and he carries a lot of weight of course
2011-01-10T12:05:24  <delt0r> I carry no weight --soo feel free to ignore
2011-01-10T12:05:47  *** nullkuhl__ is now known as nullkuhl
2011-01-10T12:08:13  <jmcarthur> nor do i, for that matter
2011-01-10T12:19:11  <amstan> jmcarthur: i think including our library in the starter package will work
2011-01-10T12:19:22  <amstan> as long as it's easy to tell the ide what to do
2011-01-10T12:26:06  <jmcarthur> well, i've never had to make a project buildable out of the box with no dependencies on multiple platforms before, so maybe i'm not even qualified to argue for it
2011-01-10T12:27:33  <delt0r> its not that...
2011-01-10T12:27:35  <jmcarthur> i personally am fine either way. i kind of like writing parsers, even
2011-01-10T12:27:51  <delt0r> its the totally newb nature of a lot of the first time coders
2011-01-10T12:28:00  <jmcarthur> i just usually think libraries are a lot nicer
2011-01-10T12:28:10  <delt0r> in many ways they are
2011-01-10T12:28:11  <jmcarthur> delt0r: but if the build scripts are already set up....
2011-01-10T12:28:18  <delt0r> yea--
2011-01-10T12:28:25  <delt0r> there is always a better fool
2011-01-10T12:29:06  <delt0r> I would expect a lot of "why doesn't this compile when i use IDE XX"
2011-01-10T12:29:38  <delt0r> and then a lot of --why did you use lame libXX rather than awesome libYY
2011-01-10T12:30:59  <delt0r> I guess i am also coming from the angle that the data should be small/simple enough that manual parsing is no big deal
2011-01-10T12:32:21  <jmcarthur> well honestly i don't think i would mind parsing simplified JSON even without a lib, but most people are not me
2011-01-10T12:32:47  <delt0r> if its that simple I would like less {}"" etc
2011-01-10T12:32:58  <delt0r> however i can filter through a regex
2011-01-10T12:33:18  <jmcarthur> unless the format uses nested objects
2011-01-10T12:33:31  <jmcarthur> then the {} are significant
2011-01-10T12:33:48  <delt0r> again simple does not equal nested in my assumed game world
2011-01-10T12:33:59  <delt0r> :/
2011-01-10T12:34:38  <jmcarthur> as i see it, simplicity is an ideal, not a criterion. that said, i also very strongly favor that ideal
2011-01-10T12:35:49  <jmcarthur> i'll just do a record-like format
2011-01-10T12:36:13  <delt0r> is this for tron "3D" ;)
2011-01-10T12:36:47  <jmcarthur> there's nothing 3d about it

2011-01-10T13:30:35  <jmcarthur> i'm just gonna go with a custom formet
2011-01-10T13:30:37  <jmcarthur> *format
2011-01-10T13:31:14  <jmcarthur> i'll expand slightly on the one suggested by delt0r though. allow multichar keys and stuff
2011-01-10T13:31:34  <jmcarthur> i think as long as we don't need nested data structures we'll be okay
2011-01-10T13:34:41  <delt0r> its something that can change to the official version easy enough
2011-01-10T13:35:38  <jmcarthur> here's what i'm toying around with looks like http://hpaste.org/paste/42914/simple_custom_format#p42930
2011-01-10T13:36:40  <jmcarthur> with lots of comments, anyway
2011-01-10T13:37:03  <delt0r> looks fine
2011-01-10T13:37:06  <Zannick> i like it
2011-01-10T13:37:07  <delt0r> mine is the same
2011-01-10T13:37:11  <delt0r> only
2011-01-10T13:37:14  <delt0r> map -> m
2011-01-10T13:37:48  <delt0r> which is a very small detail
2011-01-10T13:37:53  <jmcarthur> without comments http://hpaste.org/paste/42914/no_comments#p42931
2011-01-10T13:38:36  <delt0r> I have found that a "done" or "go"  makes many thing much easier --even with json
2011-01-10T13:38:38  <jmcarthur> i'm conflicted about the redundant information. currently has map dimensions, but also has an explicit border around the map
2011-01-10T13:39:08  <delt0r> I don't think it matters if the maps are not too big
2011-01-10T13:39:25  <delt0r> in my ant case however the IO was a big performance bottle neck
2011-01-10T13:39:37  <delt0r> for maps at the 1000x1000 sizes
2011-01-10T13:39:42  <jmcarthur> eek
2011-01-10T13:39:52  <delt0r> well with 1000 ants ...
2011-01-10T13:39:55  <jmcarthur> what kind of buffering were you using?
2011-01-10T13:39:59  <delt0r> each getting its own map...
2011-01-10T13:40:10  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-01-10T13:40:18  <jmcarthur> this was where each ant was a seperate AI?
2011-01-10T13:40:24  <delt0r> gloabal vision would have fixed this
2011-01-10T13:40:30  <delt0r> more or less
2011-01-10T13:40:30  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-10T13:40:49  <delt0r> so i think redundant is perhaps a good idea...
2011-01-10T13:40:50  *** perror <perror!~fleury@aldebaran.labri.fr> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye all !)
2011-01-10T13:41:08  <delt0r> and pretty much the whole game state each turn...
2011-01-10T13:41:08  <jmcarthur> redundant at least means that lower level programmers can preallocate an array
2011-01-10T13:41:15  <delt0r> indeed
2011-01-10T13:41:26  <delt0r> and you can add assertions etc
2011-01-10T13:41:30  <jmcarthur> okay, then that leaves the border. necessary?
2011-01-10T13:41:31  <delt0r> sanity checks
2011-01-10T13:41:40  <delt0r> up to you
2011-01-10T13:42:01  <jmcarthur> i kind of see this the way i see null terminated strings vs. storing the length at the front of the string
2011-01-10T13:42:01  <delt0r> I would make it wraping... then anding a border turns off wraping...
2011-01-10T13:42:12  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-01-10T13:42:17  <delt0r> but thats just because i like Tori topology
2011-01-10T13:42:23  <jmcarthur> i'm not a huge fan of wrapping
2011-01-10T13:42:28  <delt0r> anding->adding
2011-01-10T13:42:34  <delt0r> either way
2011-01-10T13:42:36  <jmcarthur> i find that it makes games harder for me to reason about
2011-01-10T13:42:44  <delt0r> My latest RTS does not have it
2011-01-10T13:42:59  <jmcarthur> also, i've already written most of the engine to not use wrapping and i'm lazy ;)
2011-01-10T13:43:03  <delt0r> but I have circular maps
2011-01-10T13:43:25  <delt0r> no "courner" cases... ;)
2011-01-10T13:43:40  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-01-10T13:43:54  <delt0r> also the whole map is know at the start --so its only sent once
2011-01-10T13:44:02  <delt0r> known
2011-01-10T13:45:25  <jmcarthur> the idea with this game is that the static parts of the map are known, just not the dynamic parts
2011-01-10T13:45:34  <delt0r> right
2011-01-10T13:46:17  <jmcarthur> i think it would be too hard if even static parts weren't known all the time
2011-01-10T13:47:10  <jmcarthur> the only thing i don't really like about this format is that the records are not commutative, but that's just being nitpicky i think
2011-01-10T13:48:08  <Zannick> it's better not being commutative, at least for the map part
2011-01-10T13:48:14  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-01-10T13:48:33  <jmcarthur> but that was kind of my point. the fact that the map isn't just a single record
2011-01-10T13:49:04  <Zannick> well, you could do, instead of "map" on each line, "beginmap" above it and "endmap" below it
2011-01-10T13:49:08  <Zannick> or "startmap"
2011-01-10T13:49:13  <delt0r> perhaps a map "record" could include the row number
2011-01-10T13:49:16  <delt0r> ie
2011-01-10T13:49:27  <delt0r> map 3 #...........bob...............#
2011-01-10T13:49:32  <Zannick> this is how it is actually done in some roguelikes
2011-01-10T13:49:38  <jmcarthur> i like delt0r's idea more than Zannick's
2011-01-10T13:50:10  <jmcarthur> not sure if i like it more than just not making it commutative
2011-01-10T13:51:26  <jmcarthur> it occurs to me that whitespace insensitivity after the record type would mean you can't have a map like apocalytptic
2011-01-10T13:51:47  <jmcarthur> (its borders weren't just vertical/horizontal)
2011-01-10T13:52:09  <jmcarthur> oh but i guess you could also just stick more walls around the outside anyway
2011-01-10T13:52:11  <jmcarthur> wouldn't hurt
2011-01-10T13:53:31  <delt0r> for getting a core game for ideas... i would just go with whats fastest to develop
2011-01-10T13:53:54  <Zannick> well, you could have L-shapes and indentations, but it would be easiest to just add the square walls anyway
2011-01-10T13:53:55  <delt0r> I say this as the guy who has not yet released his RTS demo game
2011-01-10T13:53:56  <jmcarthur> honestly it doesn't make a big difference to me for dev time
2011-01-10T13:54:39  <jmcarthur> i'm using a parser combinator library, so it's pretty easy to do most reasonable things
2011-01-10T13:54:54  <jmcarthur> the hard part is what other people would want to do

2011-01-10T13:55:53  <jmcarthur> also, i'm not just making a game here. i'm also making an engine that i plan to use for whatever game we ultimately use, and if we have a format in mind from the outset then i can build that into the engine to work for any game generically, as long as the format is used for other games as well
2011-01-10T13:56:11  <jmcarthur> roughly, at least
2011-01-10T13:56:15  <delt0r> right
2011-01-10T13:56:26  <jmcarthur> but... screw that, i'll just make the individual games have their own parsing
2011-01-10T13:56:40  <delt0r> I tried the generic code thing.
2011-01-10T13:56:57  <delt0r> but really the only code that got recycled was the IO process managing code
2011-01-10T13:57:02  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-01-10T13:57:12  <Zannick> i love generic coding in python
2011-01-10T13:57:23  <delt0r> but since that was still perhaps the bulk of the code... it was a win
2011-01-10T13:57:23  <jmcarthur> well, i've got a generic game running function too, which means i can also code in tournaments, network play, etc.
2011-01-10T13:57:52  <jmcarthur> so far the only IO i have is for local play though
2011-01-10T13:58:29  <delt0r> I found adding TCP very easy
2011-01-10T13:58:45  <delt0r> the turn structure makes it very easy
2011-01-10T13:59:05  <delt0r> instead of local processes with IO --you have sockets with IO

2011-01-10T13:59:32  <jmcarthur> yeah, handles make it easy
2011-01-10T14:20:47  <jmcarthur> hmm, i just remembered another thing that might be worth looking to. we currently just give a certain amount of time on each turn. i remember we have discussed many times whether it might be good to have a total amount of time that's permissible instead of a per turn time, or perhaps start with some total amount of time available and add a little bit to it on each turn
2011-01-10T14:21:19  <jmcarthur> *total amount of time to think, that is
2011-01-10T14:22:14  <jmcarthur> so if both players start with 100 seconds of time, then if player 1 uses 10 seconds on the first turn and player two uses 0.5 seconds on the first turn, they would then have 90 seconds and 99.5 seconds respectively to use on the next turn
2011-01-10T14:28:02  <janzert> the bad thing with giving just a fixed time for the full game is that every time a program locks up you have to wait the full game time before you can end the game, but some sort of hybrid might indeed be nice
2011-01-10T14:28:24  <jmcarthur> i think having a cumulative time and adding a small bit to it on each turn would be pretty good. could start with something like 10 seconds and then add something like 1 second on each turn. simple bots could just assume they have 1 second per turn and the 10 seconds could just be used to account for measurement inaccuracies
2011-01-10T14:29:19  <jmcarthur> most complex bots could try to use that extra 10 seconds more wisely
2011-01-10T14:29:23  <jmcarthur> *more complex
2011-01-10T14:29:53  <janzert> and if it uses .1 second for 100 moves then locks up?
2011-01-10T14:29:54  <Zannick> this is how a chess ai assignment was done in college
2011-01-10T14:30:24  <Zannick> started with X time and received y more after each turn
2011-01-10T14:30:29  <jmcarthur> janzert: could cap it as well?
2011-01-10T14:30:36  <jmcarthur> "use it or lose it"
2011-01-10T14:31:07  <janzert> since we play so many games, minimizing wasted time on locked up programs is an inordinately large concern compared to most other timecontrol situations
2011-01-10T14:31:49  <jmcarthur> how about the start time is also the maximum time?
2011-01-10T14:31:59  <jmcarthur> you never get more than 10 seconds saved up
2011-01-10T14:32:28  <jmcarthur> that could be lower, even
2011-01-10T14:32:45  <jmcarthur> but then the benefits of the system go down
2011-01-10T14:32:45  <janzert> a fixed pool of 1 second * max game length time for the whole game and say 5 second limit for any one turn would work well I think
2011-01-10T14:33:02  <jmcarthur> ah yeah that could work
2011-01-10T14:33:12  <janzert> or something along those lines anyway
2011-01-10T14:33:18  <jmcarthur> that may be equivalent, actually
2011-01-10T14:33:41  <jmcarthur> start with a 5 second pool, get a free second on every turn, but never save more than 5
2011-01-10T14:33:56  <janzert> that never lets you use 5 seconds two moves in a row
2011-01-10T14:34:13  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-01-10T14:34:17  <jmcarthur> not equivalent, you're right
2011-01-10T14:35:07  <janzert> yours may actually be better
2011-01-10T14:35:30  <janzert> mine would probably encourage top bots to use more time for early/more critical moves
2011-01-10T14:35:34  <jmcarthur> mine would have a more flat profile
2011-01-10T14:35:44  <janzert> so overall game times would probably be longer
2011-01-10T14:35:50  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure whether it's "better" that way
2011-01-10T14:36:25  <janzert> i.e. with mine average game time is probably closer to maximum game time which can be seen as a negative
2011-01-10T14:36:31  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-10T14:37:36  <jmcarthur> mine is basically good for cases where the bot needs a little extra "for emergencies"
2011-01-10T14:37:53  <janzert> yep
2011-01-10T14:38:07  <Zannick> i'd say 10/+1/max 5 as a start, maybe
2011-01-10T14:38:23  <jmcarthur> well, starting with 10 and having a max 5 is pointless ;)
2011-01-10T14:38:36  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-01-10T14:38:40  <jmcarthur> you mean mixing *all* the ideas
2011-01-10T14:38:52  <jmcarthur> 10 pool, add 1 each second, max 5 seconds per turn
2011-01-10T14:39:01  <Zannick> yes
2011-01-10T14:39:07  <jmcarthur> unlimited pool?
2011-01-10T14:39:16  <Zannick> this will end up with most bots averaging 1-2 seconds
2011-01-10T14:39:32  <janzert> Arimaa has quite a nice, flexible time control system
2011-01-10T14:39:49  <Zannick> there should be a fixed upper limit on the pool for implementation reasons
2011-01-10T14:39:51  <janzert> http://arimaa.com/arimaa/learn/matchRules.html
2011-01-10T14:39:59  <Zannick> but it doesn't need to be harsh
2011-01-10T14:40:01  <jmcarthur> Zannick: sounds pretty good
2011-01-10T14:41:39  <janzert> 1s/10s/100/5s is the Arimaa notation for that
2011-01-10T14:41:40  <jmcarthur> janzert: ah, arimaa rewards those who don't take the full time
2011-01-10T14:42:10  <jmcarthur> what's the 100?
2011-01-10T14:42:18  <Zannick> pool limit, i think
2011-01-10T14:42:23  <janzert> 1s per move / 10s initial reserve / 100 percent leftover is added to reserve
2011-01-10T14:42:29  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-01-10T14:42:30  <janzert> and oops I got the last part wrong
2011-01-10T14:42:31  <Zannick> oh, i see
2011-01-10T14:42:55  <janzert> it should be 1s/10s/100/0/0/5s
2011-01-10T14:43:39  <jmcarthur> arimaa time control looks complicated
2011-01-10T14:43:50  <janzert> 1s per move / 10s reserve / 100 percent leftover applied to reserve / no reserve cap / no game limit / 5s move limit

2011-01-10T19:22:27  <amstan_> nobody's up though, they were 2 hours ago
2011-01-10T19:22:35  <amstan_> jmcarthur's deving like crazy for this thing..
2011-01-10T19:22:51  <j3camero> So what's this about doing Tron again? Wouldn't people not like that since we did it less than a year ago?
2011-01-10T19:22:55  <amstan_> delt0r and Zannick are also coding/thinking if i'm not mistaken
2011-01-10T19:23:01  <j3camero> Oh really?
2011-01-10T19:23:12  <j3camero> I didn't know that. I should be on IRC more.
2011-01-10T19:23:21  <amstan_> j3camero: check the logs.. that's why i keep them
2011-01-10T19:23:28  <j3camero> I gotta start working with them as well.

2011-01-10T19:24:05  <j3camero> I should also ask them what they think about my proposed plan to do a stepping stone contest to give ourselves time to dev the next gen contest system.
2011-01-10T19:24:25  <janzert> woah, it's that j3 guy, what's his name Jay, Jeff something like that :P
2011-01-10T19:24:27  <amstan_> you should post such grand plans on the forums
2011-01-10T19:24:47  <j3camero> Hey janzert. I hope you've been well the last few weeks.
2011-01-10T19:25:06  * amstan_ just found twizzlers on his desk, woah!
2011-01-10T19:25:14  <janzert> yep, doing well thanks
2011-01-10T19:25:19  <j3camero> Yes amstan I should post the plan to the forums.
2011-01-10T19:25:24  <janzert> beating my Arimaa bot back into submission
2011-01-10T19:25:33  <amstan_> j3camero: i already did phase a of the rankings algo
2011-01-10T19:25:47  <j3camero> amstan: nice
2011-01-10T19:25:57  <j3camero> janzert: how is the Arimaa going anyways?
2011-01-10T19:26:51  <janzert> pretty well, really just tweaking what I got for this year since I'm working on a complete rewrite that won't be ready in time
2011-01-10T19:27:15  <janzert> so what's phase A for the ranking algo?
2011-01-10T19:28:49  <amstan_> janzert: we need a new algo.. if we're going to implement multi player games
2011-01-10T19:28:55  <amstan_> by multi i mean >2
2011-01-10T19:28:58  <janzert> btw, if the current backend is going to be used again I have a few pretty simple tweaks to make to help the pairing code a bit more
2011-01-10T19:29:01  <janzert> right
2011-01-10T19:29:21  * janzert points at Trueskill again :)
2011-01-10T19:29:43  <amstan_> j3camero: yeah, trueskill seems like an interesting idea
2011-01-10T19:30:27  <j3camero> Was it Janzert who did an experiment with Trueskill during Galcon?
2011-01-10T19:30:37  <jmcarthur> pong
2011-01-10T19:30:38  <j3camero> I thought it was an epic fail.
2011-01-10T19:31:03  <janzert> deltor or dmj111 ran the games from the galcon final through it recently
2011-01-10T19:31:15  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-fqmbilkcuihwmmge> has joined #aichallenge
2011-01-10T19:31:20  <jmcarthur> it was daniel, and the main failing was that the games weren't being scheduled optimally for trueskill, i think
2011-01-10T19:31:22  <janzert> it came up with pretty similiar results as bayeselo at least at the top end
2011-01-10T19:31:30  <jmcarthur> dmj111 has run it more recently with good results
2011-01-10T19:31:30  <j3camero> jmcarthur: hey amstan tells me you're laying down a bunch of code. This is really cool. I'm going to do a forum post soon tonight to try to set out a roadmap for the upcoming contest.
2011-01-10T19:31:44  <jmcarthur> j3camero: cool
2011-01-10T19:32:02  <jmcarthur> i'm not necessarily intending for my code to be anything official, but if it gets picked up then i won't complain
2011-01-10T19:32:18  <jmcarthur> it's all in haskell, which would be a limiter to contributions
2011-01-10T19:32:25  <j3camero> What is the advantage of Trueskill then? Will it handle >2 players?
2011-01-10T19:32:34  <jmcarthur> trueskill is designed to handle that
2011-01-10T19:32:49  <jmcarthur> but the main advantage is that it's more predictable than bayeselo for a running ladder
2011-01-10T19:32:53  <amstan_> j3camero: trueskill was designed to rank xbox players
2011-01-10T19:32:54  <j3camero> Interesting. It may be just what we're looking for then.
2011-01-10T19:32:59  <jmcarthur> while still keeping much of the accuracy
2011-01-10T19:33:03  <dmj111> yooo
2011-01-10T19:33:19  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't use trueskill for a final tournament
2011-01-10T19:33:24  <jmcarthur> only for the dev period
2011-01-10T19:33:51  <amstan_> jmcarthur: well... we need an algo..
2011-01-10T19:33:52  <j3camero> Okay I will refresh myself on Trueskill. I remember looking at it as one possibility back when I started using bayeselo for ranking.
2011-01-10T19:33:53  <janzert> I think trueskill should be fine for the final as well
2011-01-10T19:34:18  <janzert> but will take more work to use than bayeselo did
2011-01-10T19:34:28  <dmj111> like writing it :/
2011-01-10T19:34:40  <dmj111> i have two player implemented, kind of.
2011-01-10T19:34:43  <janzert> yep, that's the big thing :)
2011-01-10T19:34:48  <j3camero> We've been through a lot of ranking systems. What's most important is that it's widely perceived as being fair.
2011-01-10T19:34:52  <dmj111> multi-player, without teams, may not bee too bad.
2011-01-10T19:34:58  <jmcarthur> two player is all i care about. i hope we don't do a game for more than two players, personally
2011-01-10T19:35:06  <dmj111> multi-player, with teams is horrific.
2011-01-10T19:35:42  <amstan_> jmcarthur: ants will be interesting with >2
2011-01-10T19:35:49  <jmcarthur> j3camero: trueskill doesn't retroactively change your score, and your score gradually rises over time after submission rather than jumping around :)
2011-01-10T19:36:05  <jmcarthur> well, it can still jump around, but not as much as bayeselo
2011-01-10T19:36:08  <dmj111> and advantage of trueskill is that M$oft has a webpage you can use to verify that calculations, given the incoming player skill levels and the result.
2011-01-10T19:36:17  <amstan_> dmj111: +1, lol
2011-01-10T19:36:18  <dmj111> man, I cannot type.
2011-01-10T19:36:30  <jmcarthur> a big disadvantage of trueskill is lack of good implementations :\
2011-01-10T19:36:38  <amstan_> who's with me for making a python implementation... or... making python bindings for a c++ implementation
2011-01-10T19:36:53  <j3camero> Maybe this is our chance to contribute a good quality trueskill library to the FOSS community.
2011-01-10T19:37:07  <amstan_> in python!
2011-01-10T19:37:09  <jmcarthur> a C implementation, if i had my druthers. easily bindable to other languages
2011-01-10T19:37:23  <amstan_> what's a druther?
2011-01-10T19:37:39  <jmcarthur> "I'drather it be in C"
2011-01-10T19:38:06  <dmj111> this guys web page probably has the most complete explanation : http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html
2011-01-10T19:38:20  <jmcarthur> he has a link to a pdf with even a little more information
2011-01-10T19:38:31  <dmj111> yes, that part is probably the most important part.
2011-01-10T19:38:35  <dmj111> and a C# implementation.
2011-01-10T19:39:32  <amstan_> translate the c# one?
2011-01-10T19:39:44  <jmcarthur> well, my engine currently has 459 lines of code, according to sloccount, so i wouldn't say i've gone *too* crazy with the coding. this engine includes parallel implementations of tron and stratego
2011-01-10T19:39:48  <dmj111> maybe... it is definitely not written in a style I would like to emulate.
2011-01-10T19:39:59  <jmcarthur> ugh yeah, that C# code is pretty bad
2011-01-10T19:41:34  <jmcarthur> j3camero: regarding the tron game... this one is pretty different from the previous one
2011-01-10T19:41:48  <Zannick> i am mostly thinking at this point, no coding yet
2011-01-10T19:42:14  <Zannick> but i intend to when we get started
2011-01-10T19:42:20  <dmj111> I can take another look at the paper and C# code, and see what I think about a Python version.  (probably in a style that could be easily ported to C)
2011-01-10T19:42:55  <dmj111> ok, not probably, but more so than the C# code.
2011-01-10T19:43:06  <dmj111> i'll be back later.
2011-01-10T19:43:22  <jmcarthur> j3camero: tentative example of what a game state could look like:  http://hpaste.org/raw/42930/simple_custom_format
2011-01-10T19:43:28  <amstan_> dmj111: i want it to have a nice high level python interface
2011-01-10T19:43:29  <jmcarthur> with a bunch of comments
2011-01-10T19:43:32  <amstan_> that could be used to rank classes
2011-01-10T19:43:48  <Zannick> like, when the github repo is opened to contributors (and my account is Zannick, of course)
2011-01-10T19:43:54  <amstan_> jmcarthur: what is that?
2011-01-10T19:44:07  <amstan_> Zannick: you can dev on your own too, we can pull
2011-01-10T19:44:07  <j3camero> I guess if we used trueskill for multiplayer games we would have the option to not subtract 3 sigmas from people's scores. It seems like subtracting 3 sigmas would make people think that their bot earns points just by playing games. People may also come to believe that re-submitting your bot wipes out all your points.
2011-01-10T19:44:12  <jmcarthur> amstan_: tron
2011-01-10T19:44:31  <Zannick> yeah, but i'm less inclined to work on it while i have other things to work on :)
2011-01-10T19:44:34  <amstan_> jmcarthur: sorry.. i meant to say what file format is that? yaml?
2011-01-10T19:44:39  <jmcarthur> amstan_: custom
2011-01-10T19:45:03  <amstan_> j3camero: i agree
2011-01-10T19:45:19  <j3camero> jmcarthur: looks very cool. I like the multi-agent idea. People have been asking for a multi-agent game.
2011-01-10T19:45:23  <jmcarthur> amstan_: here's a YAMLy version http://hpaste.org/raw/42914/yaml
2011-01-10T19:45:27  <amstan_> jmcarthur: zomg, lasttime! that's interesting
2011-01-10T19:45:35  <jmcarthur> amstan_: i have a ton of ideas :)
2011-01-10T19:46:02  <jmcarthur> amstan_: a page full of a few versions: http://hpaste.org/42914/yaml
2011-01-10T19:46:15  <amstan_> suggestion for everyone, if you want things pasted that are slightly important, you can use github gists, they're git managed as well
2011-01-10T19:46:46  <janzert> that makes me think of one thing I think should possibly change for the next contest, along with simple functional tests for submissions, pairing should not use least recently played submission but least recently played user (i.e. resubmission shouldn't bump you to the head of the line)
2011-01-10T19:46:48  <jmcarthur> i'll roll with that for the sake of convention
2011-01-10T19:47:19  <jmcarthur> janzert: agreed
2011-01-10T19:47:54  <jmcarthur> we had a nicer conversation earlier about timing
2011-01-10T19:48:05  <amstan_> we need a place to share ideas, while we can all edit at the same time, a wiki would be ideal, but.. we don't have one at this point
2011-01-10T19:48:26  <amstan_> maybe gists can do that...
2011-01-10T19:48:40  <jmcarthur> i'm thinking something like each bot gets a 10 second "reserve" to start with, on each turn you gain 1 second to add to the reserve, and you may use up to 5 seconds of your reserve per turn
2011-01-10T19:49:21  <jmcarthur> or whatever concrete numbers we end up with
2011-01-10T19:49:42  <jmcarthur> janzert and Zannick both contributed to the idea a lot
2011-01-10T19:50:20  <jmcarthur> s/nicer conversation/nice conversation/
2011-01-10T19:51:18  <amstan_> can you guys test this? https://gist.github.com/773794
2011-01-10T19:51:34  <amstan_> yay or nay?
2011-01-10T19:51:54  <jmcarthur> i can comment...
2011-01-10T19:52:04  <jmcarthur> or fork
2011-01-10T19:52:06  <amstan_> yeah, but no editing..
2011-01-10T19:52:15  <amstan_> can you merge? hmm?
2011-01-10T19:52:22  <jmcarthur> i'll fork and we'll see
2011-01-10T19:52:51  <amstan_> i'm thinking a forum thread in the behind the scenes section might be a better idea
2011-01-10T19:52:58  <jmcarthur> i don't see a way to merge aside from pulling it down with git
2011-01-10T19:53:10  <jmcarthur> i've forked and edited it here: https://gist.github.com/773795
2011-01-10T19:53:23  <jmcarthur> i agree on the forum thread(s) idea
2011-01-10T19:53:46  <amstan_> yeah... ok..
2011-01-10T19:53:58  <amstan_> everyone here, if you don't have access to behind the scenes, here's your chance
2011-01-10T19:55:57  <amstan_> jmcarthur, janzert: http://www.ai-contest.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=1237
2011-01-10T19:56:22  <amstan_> j3camero: where's those ants? i wanna see them
2011-01-10T19:59:35  <j3camero> I was reading about Trueskill
2011-01-10T20:00:26  <j3camero> I think I'll go for a run. When I'm back I will hack out the Ants simulation and try to crank out a video before the end of the night.
2011-01-10T20:01:10  <j3camero> So two things I want to get done tonight: (1) produce a video of the ants simulation and (2) post a roadmap for the next two contests to the forums.
2011-01-10T20:01:58  <jmcarthur> i would prefer the latter over the former if you have to choose
2011-01-10T20:03:47  <j3camero> Okay I'll do that first. But I am going for a run now.
2011-01-10T20:04:19  <j3camero> I am excited that there are people around who want to help in the initial stages! This is so cool!
2011-01-10T20:05:28  <amstan_> j3camero: it's all about the time after the contest.. there shouldn't be huge breaks in between
2011-01-10T20:05:37  <jmcarthur> hear hear
2011-01-10T20:05:46  <jmcarthur> well, at least not huge *silent* breaks
2011-01-10T20:06:03  <jmcarthur> there should always be something happening
2011-01-10T20:06:25  <amstan_> jmcarthur: so.. what's your opinion on django and the move to git?
2011-01-10T20:06:45  <jmcarthur> moving to a distributed VCS is a *must*, IMO
2011-01-10T20:06:53  <j3camero> Agreed.
2011-01-10T20:07:00  <j3camero> Also Django seems to be awesome.
2011-01-10T20:07:15  <jmcarthur> which one doesn't matter quite as much to me. i have my preferences (darcs), but git would be fine
2011-01-10T20:07:21  <jmcarthur> django beats php
2011-01-10T20:07:29  <jmcarthur> i don't really like most web frameworks
2011-01-10T20:07:38  <jmcarthur> s/django/python/
2011-01-10T20:07:46  <jmcarthur> the fact that it's django doesn't matter much

2011-01-10T20:09:03  <jmcarthur> also, if my engine is to be supported in any *official* capacity, i'm going to insist on darcs since i'm already using it. but like i said, i find this scenario doubtful due to my language choice, and i don't really care ;)
2011-01-10T20:09:57  <jmcarthur> time to make dinner
2011-01-10T20:10:13  <amstan_> jmcarthur: that's not what i meant by small ideas, i meant that one liner that you said, same with zannick's
2011-01-10T20:10:40  <amstan_> the language has nothing to do with using it or not.. and aren't there darcs-git converters?
2011-01-10T20:10:54  <amstan_> i know the hg-git one is almost transparent

2011-01-10T20:47:19  <Zannick> i think i verified my email with github
2011-01-10T20:47:32  <amstan_> i still need it, so i can make your commits by you
2011-01-10T20:47:37  <amstan_> that's how github maps commits to users
2011-01-10T20:47:40  <Zannick> ah
2011-01-10T20:47:41  <amstan_> by the email address in the commit
2011-01-10T20:47:57  <amstan_> i got that wrong once and half my project was made by "invalid email address"
2011-01-10T20:48:14  <Zannick> sent email address in pm
2011-01-10T20:48:43  <amstan_> so.. this won't be very private mind you
2011-01-10T20:48:58  <Zannick> yeah, well :/
2011-01-10T20:49:03  <amstan_> anybody who clones the repo will see it
2011-01-10T20:49:10  <Zannick> my public repositories on bitbucket have my email in the clear
2011-01-10T20:49:16  <amstan_> ok
2011-01-10T20:49:40  <amstan_> should i keep your full name as Zannick or the real one?
2011-01-10T20:49:41  <Zannick> i'm not sure whether i have to put the +github in order to match in both my gitconfig or not
2011-01-10T20:49:51  <Zannick> hm.
2011-01-10T20:49:54  <amstan_> it should be the same one from gitconfig..
2011-01-10T20:50:23  <Zannick> yeah, my gitconfig will contain Benjamin S Wolf <jokeserver@gmail.com> so use that
2011-01-10T20:50:28  <amstan_> ok
2011-01-10T20:50:46  <amstan_> well.. i think that's all
2011-01-10T20:51:35  <amstan_> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/people/list -> https://gist.github.com/773851
2011-01-10T20:51:39  <amstan_> anyone that i missed?
2011-01-10T20:51:51  <amstan_> i mostly want to get the ppl that commited the most
2011-01-10T21:02:40  <janzert> janzert@janzert.com is the more common address for me and the one github knows
2011-01-10T21:03:15  <amstan_> i had you as gmail
2011-01-10T21:03:18  <amstan_> ok..
2011-01-10T21:03:24  <amstan_> the only one left is dmj
2011-01-10T21:03:26  <amstan_> i have his email
2011-01-10T21:03:31  <amstan_> i should get a name though
2011-01-10T21:03:37  <amstan_> should i just leave it as dmj?
2011-01-10T21:04:29  <janzert> I imagine he'll give you a reply by morning
2011-01-10T21:05:38  <amstan_> i wanna finish this by then
2011-01-10T21:09:28  <dmj111> hey... just saw this.
2011-01-10T21:09:44  <dmj111> I don't have github yet... I'll sign up now.
2011-01-10T21:10:03  <amstan_> dmj111: use your dave@ email
2011-01-10T21:10:23  <amstan_> and tell me a full name to use for the git commits
2011-01-10T21:10:28  <amstan_> it can be dmj if you want
2011-01-10T21:13:36  <jmcarthur> amstan_: what one-liner?
2011-01-10T21:13:53  <amstan_> jmcarthur: your timeout stuff
2011-01-10T21:14:01  <jmcarthur> oh i see
2011-01-10T21:14:12  <amstan_> and janzert's new submission ranking stuf
2011-01-10T21:14:15  <dmj111> dmj is fine with me, but if you are using full names its Dave Jones.
2011-01-10T21:14:31  <amstan_> depends how you want to appear in your git log
2011-01-10T21:14:37  <amstan_> should be teh same as your gitconfig setting
2011-01-10T21:14:44  <jmcarthur> amstan_: there are indeed (very crappy) darcs-git converters
2011-01-10T21:15:12  <dmj111> amstan_: i will probably put my name in, not initials.
2011-01-10T21:16:28  *** nullkuhl <nullkuhl!~nullkuhl@196.221.108.209> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2011-01-10T21:16:47  <jmcarthur> i just don't really want to move away from darcs because (1) i'm selfish and (2) there's not really any reason to, as they are both DVCSs anyway, which is the most important thing
2011-01-10T21:18:07  <jmcarthur> i mean, it's not something i'd cry about. i just think it's silly and pointless, and it would *kind of* slow me down for a while as i adjust to using git
2011-01-10T21:18:22  <jmcarthur> and it would force me to use a different development model than i'm used to
2011-01-10T21:21:23  <jmcarthur> amstan_: the hg-git one is nearly transparent because hg and git are very similar ;)
2011-01-10T21:21:32  <amstan_> yeah...
2011-01-10T21:21:43  <amstan_> grrrr
2011-01-10T21:21:45  <amstan_> Author: AlexRiedler not defined in ../authors file
2011-01-10T21:23:08  <amstan_> who's andymatuszewski?
2011-01-10T21:24:24  <amstan_> oh well @gmail.com it is
2011-01-10T21:25:08  <dmj111> j3camero: i think the confidence interval stuff is a good reason to use it.  It would add incentive to let your bot play a while, instead of add incentive to resubmit when you lose.
2011-01-10T21:25:36  <dmj111> but, there would need to be an explanation, I guess...

2011-01-10T21:26:58  <jmcarthur> i don't think any deep explanation would be necessary. people expect their visible scores to drop when they resubmit anyway
2011-01-10T21:34:15  <jmcarthur> amstan_: okay i deleted my other post and wrote a new one
2011-01-10T21:34:27  <amstan_> jmcarthur: good man
2011-01-10T21:38:58  <amstan_> i'm up to r 400
2011-01-10T21:39:09  <amstan_> still stopping from time to time to add someone to the list
2011-01-10T21:39:53  <jmcarthur> just added another idea to my post that i hadn't mentioned here before
2011-01-10T21:39:56  <amstan_> i hope it'll fit on github
2011-01-10T21:40:06  <janzert> shouldn't be anyone new past that I don't believe
2011-01-10T21:40:50  <janzert> most of them are just me iterating through problems :}
2011-01-10T21:41:09  <amstan_> janzert: put your idea too
2011-01-10T21:41:55  <janzert> yeah, I'm planning on posting a few tomorrow
2011-01-10T21:42:13  <amstan_> oh god.. how many maps do we have..
2011-01-10T21:42:15  <amstan_> gees
2011-01-10T21:42:21  <amstan_> omg, it's done
2011-01-10T21:42:26  <janzert> hehe
2011-01-10T21:42:39  <amstan_> 68MB
2011-01-10T21:42:43  <amstan_> the whole git repo
2011-01-10T21:42:56  <amstan_> before git gc
2011-01-10T21:43:47  <janzert> there is so much game specific stuff in there though I almost wonder if you don't want to try and strip out the game neutral stuff and start a new repo for the next contest
2011-01-10T21:43:49  <jmcarthur> aaaand i keep adding more
2011-01-10T21:43:57  <amstan_> 18MB
2011-01-10T21:44:07  <amstan_> 18MB is fine..
2011-01-10T21:44:13  <janzert> I guess 18MB of legacy isn't bad
2011-01-10T21:44:19  <amstan_> yeah, no
2011-01-10T21:44:27  <amstan_> and like.. we'll get the pretty graphs and everything as well
2011-01-10T21:45:30  <amstan_> hmm
2011-01-10T21:45:35  <amstan_> only one branch?? how does this work?
2011-01-10T21:45:55  <jmcarthur> what did you use to convert?
2011-01-10T21:46:17  <amstan_> git svn
2011-01-10T21:46:31  <jmcarthur> if you used git-svn you have to tell it what subdirectories branches and tags were supposed to be in
2011-01-10T21:46:37  <amstan_> git svn clone
2011-01-10T21:46:38  <amstan_> i did
2011-01-10T21:46:48  <amstan_> i used the -s flag
2011-01-10T21:46:59  <amstan_> git svn clone https://ai-contest.googlecode.com/svn/ -s --authors-file ../authors

2011-01-10T21:48:32  <j3camero> Okay roadmap for the next two contests is posted.
2011-01-10T21:48:43  <j3camero> It's just my opinion, it's not binding law or anything.
2011-01-10T21:48:56  <amstan_> "-s is for --stdlayout which presumes the svn recommended layout for tags, trunk, and branches."
2011-01-10T21:49:06  <j3camero> People can feel free to tell me to buzz off and keep doing what theyre doing.
2011-01-10T21:49:22  <amstan_> woah, codenames!
2011-01-10T21:50:46  <jmcarthur> oh i misread the manpage then
2011-01-10T21:51:06  <amstan_> jmcarthur: oh well.. w/e, it's not like we had any worthwhile branches
2011-01-10T21:51:26  <janzert> amstan: you really, really want the worker code branch
2011-01-10T21:51:38  <janzert> that's where all the actually used engine code is
2011-01-10T21:51:46  <amstan_> ugh.. ok
2011-01-10T21:51:54  <amstan_> how do i get it then? lol
2011-01-10T21:52:00  <amstan_> http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html
2011-01-10T21:52:06  <amstan_> i already used -s, didn't like me
2011-01-10T21:52:24  * janzert shrugs
2011-01-10T21:52:36  <jmcarthur> lemme just give it a shot myself
2011-01-10T21:52:48  <janzert> I have almost no experience with git nevermind converting an svn repo into it :/
2011-01-10T21:53:09  <amstan_> look at that page, grep for If more than one --branches (or --tags) option was given to the init or clone command, you must provide the location of the branch
2011-01-10T21:53:10  <amstan_> doing that
2011-01-10T21:53:23  <amstan_> wait.. nvm
2011-01-10T21:53:33  <amstan_> i'm confused
2011-01-10T21:54:02  * janzert is the guy with DVCS experience in inverse proportion to popularity
2011-01-10T21:54:17  <jmcarthur> janzert: so which one do you use?
2011-01-10T21:54:21  <janzert> well, at least for the big 3
2011-01-10T21:54:29  <janzert> I don't go off the deep end to darcs :P
2011-01-10T21:54:41  <jmcarthur> the big three are git, hg, and bazaar?
2011-01-10T21:54:48  <janzert> bzr more then hg more then git
2011-01-10T21:54:53  <janzert> jmcarthur: yeah
2011-01-10T21:54:54  <jmcarthur> heh, darcs isn't even the least popular :P
2011-01-10T21:55:05  <amstan_> csv?
2011-01-10T21:55:08  <amstan_> cvs*
2011-01-10T21:55:08  <janzert> yeah that's true
2011-01-10T21:55:10  <jmcarthur> it's probably number 4
2011-01-10T21:55:20  <jmcarthur> amstan_: the D is for distributed, which CVS is not ;)
2011-01-10T21:55:21  <janzert> cvs isn't a DVCS
2011-01-10T21:55:40  <janzert> although I did use it 15 years ago or so
2011-01-10T21:55:40  <amstan_> yeah, i was just trying to troll
2011-01-10T21:56:02  <jmcarthur> amstan_: git-svn is reporting that it's pulling branches, for me
2011-01-10T21:56:24  <janzert> and actually I still type DVCS as DCVS half the time because of that
2011-01-10T21:56:26  <amstan_> jmcarthur: same here.. but it didn't make any git branches
2011-01-10T21:56:36  <jmcarthur> okay i'll just wait until the end then
2011-01-10T21:56:48  <amstan_> it takes forever
2011-01-10T21:56:50  <jmcarthur> i pointed out all the paths manually instead of using -s
2011-01-10T21:56:59  <j3camero> amstan: hacking tomorrow?
2011-01-10T21:57:00  <jmcarthur> yeah i'm only on r142 right now
2011-01-10T21:57:09  <jmcarthur> svn is so sloooow
2011-01-10T21:57:13  <j3camero> amstan: gchat me to set it up so I get the message when I come back.
2011-01-10T21:57:28  * janzert is off to bed, have fun converting :)
2011-01-10T21:57:56  <amstan_> j3camero: yes, let's meet
2011-01-10T21:58:38  <amstan_> janzert: did you see the proposal?
2011-01-10T21:58:42  <j3camero> to the coffee shop with the mad cute barista?

2011-01-10T22:00:07  <janzert> the roadmap? haven't read it yet no, will check it out in the morning
2011-01-10T22:00:45  <janzert> but I don't expect to be very active for the next one anyway so just ignore me for now ;)
2011-01-10T22:01:01  <amstan_> janzert: ok.. so i have access to the branches now.. what do we need?
2011-01-10T22:01:30  <janzert> <some date>-in-the-cloud or something like that
2011-01-10T22:01:37  <amstan_> janzert: sure
2011-01-10T22:01:56  <janzert> that is the code that was actually running on the workers
2011-01-10T22:02:02  <amstan_> janzert: 20100929-games-in-the-cloud, can i rename it?
2011-01-10T22:02:11  <janzert> sure :)
2011-01-10T22:02:21  <amstan_> maybe i could even merge it..
2011-01-10T22:02:56  <amstan_> jmcarthur: it's all good, i can upload
2011-01-10T22:03:04  <janzert> the download script needs to be updated to at the very least use git anyway
2011-01-10T22:03:05  <jmcarthur> okay cool
2011-01-10T22:03:29  <jmcarthur> mine got them all, btw
2011-01-10T22:03:44  <amstan_> jmcarthur: i forgot to -a or -r
2011-01-10T22:03:46  <jmcarthur> so i don't know what you did wrong :P
2011-01-10T22:03:51  <jmcarthur> oh, on git branch?
2011-01-10T22:04:02  <amstan_> jmcarthur: yep.. didn't realize they were repote
2011-01-10T22:04:06  <amstan_> remote*
2011-01-10T22:04:19  <jmcarthur> amstan_: yeah. when you push to github i think you would need to add --all to it
2011-01-10T22:04:33  <amstan_> jmcarthur: hmm?
2011-01-10T22:04:40  <jmcarthur> amstan_: it won't push remotes by default
2011-01-10T22:04:44  <jmcarthur> because, well, they're remotes
2011-01-10T22:05:03  <janzert> actually just merging the backend directory of the worker branch into a worker directory of trunk would probably be fine
2011-01-10T22:05:59  <jmcarthur> amstan_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1584675/converting-svn-to-git-how-to-get-the-branches-not-to-be-just-remote-in-the-svn-r
2011-01-10T22:06:00  <amstan_> i'll keep 2 branches for now
2011-01-10T22:06:01  <amstan_> pw
2011-01-10T22:06:03  <amstan_> and pw/worker
2011-01-10T22:06:18  <amstan_> jmcarthur: i don't want to pollute the git with all the svn branches
2011-01-10T22:06:30  * jmcarthur shrugs
2011-01-10T22:06:32  <jmcarthur> alright
2011-01-10T22:08:22  <jmcarthur> i find myself not liking many of the ideas j3camero listed under Zeta, including the ones that i know have been talked about before. i disagree with having multiple contests at a time and allowing users to upload new games. and i find the idea to allow users to develop their bots in the browser kind of frivolous.
2011-01-10T22:08:35  <amstan_> pw-worker
2011-01-10T22:09:00  <amstan_> jmcarthur: yeah.. he has some wild ideas that might not work
2011-01-10T22:09:02  <jmcarthur> i mainly think any from-scratch effort should be to make what we already have awesome and more featureful
2011-01-10T22:09:29  <jmcarthur> and stable, well-specified, etc.
2011-01-10T22:09:57  <amstan_> another thing we were orgasming over was git repo integration..
2011-01-10T22:10:02  <jmcarthur> multiple contests at once sounds like a great way to make each contest individually meaningless
2011-01-10T22:10:12  <amstan_> make the contest linked to a git repo's branch
2011-01-10T22:10:17  <amstan_> and each commit is a submission
2011-01-10T22:10:20  <jmcarthur> ... integration? you mean like, git push to the server and it uses your code?
2011-01-10T22:10:23  <amstan_> yep!
2011-01-10T22:10:24  <jmcarthur> *each* commit?
2011-01-10T22:10:33  <amstan_> well.. from a specific branch
2011-01-10T22:10:36  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-01-10T22:10:48  <jmcarthur> well, i don't think the idea is all that bad, but i think it sounds frivolous too
2011-01-10T22:11:18  <jmcarthur> it would be easier to just include a script with the start packs to automatically zip and upload your bot
