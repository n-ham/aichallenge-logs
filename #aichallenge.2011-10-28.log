2011-10-28T00:01:59  <Dominater> Does anyone know how to get a different map than the tutorial working locally?
2011-10-28T00:02:02  <SharkMonkey> This is AI-CHALLENGE
2011-10-28T00:02:12  * SharkMonkey kicks bobbydroptable from the channel
2011-10-28T00:02:14  <Dominater> I changed the path in my shell script to a new map, it loads it but then crashed
2011-10-28T00:02:19  <Dominater> crashes*
2011-10-28T00:02:20  <SharkMonkey> Into #big bit
2011-10-28T00:02:28  <SharkMonkey> #bigpit
2011-10-28T00:03:05  <SharkMonkey> Dominater, Make exctra double sure the path is correct.
2011-10-28T00:03:06  <bobbydroptable> *falls*
2011-10-28T00:03:07  <bobbydroptable> hehe
2011-10-28T00:03:21  <SharkMonkey> Dominater, Are you getting any error message/output?
2011-10-28T00:03:47  <Dominater> nope nothing
2011-10-28T00:04:08  <Dominater> I changed the /example/tutorial1.map into /maze/maze_1.map
2011-10-28T00:04:22  <Dominater> It loads the map, but it crashes before any turns happen
2011-10-28T00:04:31  <bobbydroptable> well i wouldn't take the behavior of the top bots to be indicative of their final version... they're probably working on new versions and trialing it on tcp servers... they're come in and steamroll everyone else

2011-10-28T00:07:21  <SharkMonkey> Dominater, Is that exactly what you entered? Because there isn't a maze_1.map
2011-10-28T00:08:01  <Dominater> There is in mine, I downloaded the starter package before the contest started
2011-10-28T00:08:15  <Zannick> it may be a bad map, then
2011-10-28T00:08:20  <Dominater> actually the game finishes before it even starts "Lona Survivor"

2011-10-28T00:08:31  <Zannick> probably has no hills
2011-10-28T00:08:31  <SharkMonkey> Dominater, Why not use the latest version then?
2011-10-28T00:09:17  <Zannick> i'd guess it's more likely to have bugs if you are using a prelaunch version
2011-10-28T00:09:24  <grom358> okay.. i don't understand the wall punch example. i take it u can't attack pass your own ant

2011-10-28T02:14:43  <bobbydroptable> yeh for that you probably don't want to use a comparer on location that wouldn't do anything without a reference point

2011-10-28T02:38:14  <overburn> in the specs
2011-10-28T02:38:28  <overburn> it says it is like "f 2 5" etc

2011-10-28T02:38:44  <bobbydroptable> overburn
2011-10-28T02:38:48  <overburn> but when i read it in php , it is f 20  or f 28 , or such
2011-10-28T02:39:11  <bobbydroptable> should be as specs
2011-10-28T02:39:21  <bobbydroptable> bug with your input routines?

2011-10-28T08:12:35  <lericson> are you kidding me
2011-10-28T08:14:16  <GeorgeJ> Have you guys got any way of redirecting stdin and stdout? I wish to debug my bot with valgrind while playing a game
2011-10-28T08:18:34  <isbric> xathis: --nolaunch is exaxtly what it sounds like ;)
2011-10-28T08:19:14  <Minthos> GeorgeJ: can't you just redirect valgrind's output to a file and tail that file?
2011-10-28T08:21:01  <GeorgeJ> Minthos: Not really, I run the bot within valgrind, It takes input from stdin and outputs to stdout as usual, but, the bot worker will also get input from valgrind, since valgrind also outputs on stdout afaik
2011-10-28T08:21:46  <Minthos> you can tell valgrind to output to file instead, but it should output on stderr
2011-10-28T08:21:50  <Minthos> by default
2011-10-28T08:22:04  <GeorgeJ> I see

2011-10-28T08:22:41  <GeorgeJ> So I could output bot traces on stderr, valgrind also outputs on stderr, and stdin and stdout is used to communicate with the worker
2011-10-28T08:23:09  <GeorgeJ> Output stderr to a file, and tail that file for clarity
2011-10-28T08:23:26  <GeorgeJ> That's actually not too bad

2011-10-28T08:43:29  <liberforce> i'm doing C too
2011-10-28T08:43:39  <liberforce> but the starter project in C is a bit short
2011-10-28T08:43:49  <GeorgeJ> I didn't touch the C starter project
2011-10-28T08:43:51  <gerard_> GeorgeJ: I never had to implement my own data structures, but maybe I haven't done enough advanced AI programming
2011-10-28T08:43:55  <liberforce> so i still haven't written path finding either :)
2011-10-28T08:43:56  <dwins> GeorgeJ: heh, my ants have no memory (except about water squares) and they seem to do ok
2011-10-28T08:43:56  <GeorgeJ> Started from 0, read the specs
2011-10-28T08:44:11  <gerard_> usually the standard ones (vector,set,map) work fine for me
2011-10-28T08:44:13  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: maybe that's what I should have done
2011-10-28T08:44:30  <callahan> Me too.  I restrated in C after the python thing timed out regularly.
2011-10-28T08:44:42  <liberforce> instead i'm getting a hard time doing it right from what was given
2011-10-28T08:44:47  <GeorgeJ> Well, the more tools you've got when you're building the AI the more easier it is
2011-10-28T08:44:49  <gerard_> callahan: the servers are SLOW... somehow my bot keeps timing out
2011-10-28T08:45:08  <gerard_> currently overengineering a time manager
2011-10-28T08:45:18  <GeorgeJ> Besides, with a 1.5Gb of memory. I'm thinking of implementing some cacheing at some point
2011-10-28T08:45:26  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: do you reimplement linked lists, etc., or do you use external code ?
2011-10-28T08:45:28  <callahan> I haven't timed out in a while.  But my bot is pretty dumb.
2011-10-28T08:45:37  <GeorgeJ> liberforce: Reimplemented
2011-10-28T08:45:53  <GeorgeJ> Their so easy I don't need external code
2011-10-28T08:45:59  <GeorgeJ> They're*
2011-10-28T08:46:20  <GeorgeJ> Well, I've got an AntList linked-list, but I think I'll go with a general linked list
2011-10-28T08:46:39  <liberforce> well, depends, you can gain lots of time in using  code that has already been tested
2011-10-28T08:46:54  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.10299 i'm proud of my bot
2011-10-28T08:47:04  <liberforce> I thought in getting some GLib code, as i'm familiar with it
2011-10-28T08:47:19  <GeorgeJ> liberforce: A linked list is a pretty straightforward think

2011-10-28T08:48:02  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: a linked list sure, but binary trees, growableable array, queues, etc.
2011-10-28T08:48:06  <liberforce> all this take time
2011-10-28T08:48:18  <liberforce> takes time to implement
2011-10-28T08:48:39  <GeorgeJ> Yup, that's why I pondered switching to java
2011-10-28T08:48:43  <dwins> Fluxid: cool
2011-10-28T08:48:57  <GeorgeJ> But it's all a learning experience. I don't mind implementing
2011-10-28T08:49:04  <liberforce> and what is interesting in the challenge is the AI algorithms, not reimplementing basic stuff that python, java had right out of the box
2011-10-28T08:49:18  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: yeah, thought of python too
2011-10-28T08:49:28  <liberforce> but i'm better at optimizing C thant python :)
2011-10-28T08:49:39  <GeorgeJ> Besides, I've got linked list so I don't have to use dynamic arrays, and queues are just a simple layer on top of a list
2011-10-28T08:50:08  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: linked lists and growable arrays don't have the same algorithmic complexity
2011-10-28T08:50:59  <GeorgeJ> Ofcourse they don't, but having so many delete operations on a list makes it the better choice
2011-10-28T08:51:00  <liberforce> so i'm pretty sure i'll have to use both
2011-10-28T08:51:14  <GeorgeJ> Atleast so far, for me
2011-10-28T08:51:26  <liberforce> hum...
2011-10-28T08:51:34  <GeorgeJ> I don't really need traveral speed so far, perhaps for caches
2011-10-28T08:51:40  <liberforce> I don't understand your rationale on deletes ?
2011-10-28T08:51:56  <liberforce> oh, ok, i understand
2011-10-28T08:52:15  <liberforce> well, that depends if you need sorted things
2011-10-28T08:52:15  <GeorgeJ> How do you delete an item from the middle of an array? ^_^
2011-10-28T08:52:35  <GeorgeJ> Sure, you can mark it as deleted, but then, how do you add an item to the array? Traverse the whole array?
2011-10-28T08:52:42  <liberforce> you replace it by the last item, and decrement the length of the array
2011-10-28T08:53:06  <liberforce> to add, you just append it, and track you've an item more
2011-10-28T08:53:08  <liberforce> easy
2011-10-28T08:53:20  <liberforce> the trick is to make the array big enoug

2011-10-28T08:53:31  <liberforce> or resize it when needed
2011-10-28T08:53:38  <GeorgeJ> liberforce: replace it by the last item? I don't understand
2011-10-28T08:54:00  <liberforce> if you want to remove an item in the middle of an array:
2011-10-28T08:54:07  <GeorgeJ> If you delete an item from the middle of a simple array, you have an empty spot
2011-10-28T08:54:25  <liberforce> 1. copy the last item of the array on the item you want to delete
2011-10-28T08:54:27  <GeorgeJ> With a linked list, you do not
2011-10-28T08:54:36  <liberforce> 2. decrement the size of your array
2011-10-28T08:54:56  <liberforce> of course, the order changes

2011-10-28T08:55:13  <liberforce> but if order is not important, it's a better choice
2011-10-28T08:55:34  <GeorgeJ> I still don't understand, array[5] = array[count] copies values, is that what you mean?
2011-10-28T08:56:23  <liberforce> to delete item 5
2011-10-28T08:56:44  <liberforce> well, to delete array[5]:
2011-10-28T08:56:48  <thestinger> memmove :P
2011-10-28T08:57:09  <liberforce> array[5] = array[--count];
2011-10-28T08:57:36  <liberforce> yeah, or memmove
2011-10-28T08:57:41  <GeorgeJ> Yes, then array[5] would be empty, wouldn't it?
2011-10-28T08:57:55  <liberforce> nope
2011-10-28T08:58:07  <GeorgeJ> Oh I understand
2011-10-28T08:58:13  <liberforce> it is overwritten by the value of the last item
2011-10-28T08:58:24  <GeorgeJ> Yeah, I get it
2011-10-28T08:58:33  <barsandcat> omg. I was thinking to rewrite my python bot in C++, but now... I will not

2011-10-28T08:58:52  <GeorgeJ> Hmm, that's actually a good ideea
2011-10-28T08:58:56  <liberforce> but an array is better for non-ordered
2011-10-28T08:59:04  <thestinger> barsandcat: why not?
2011-10-28T08:59:24  <barsandcat> You can not implement your container in python
2011-10-28T08:59:34  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: hey, that's what GLib does ;-)
2011-10-28T08:59:36  <barsandcat> so you will not spend your time on it
2011-10-28T08:59:49  <GeorgeJ> I don't need ordering. I was just thinking that the overhead of reallocating an array would have more of an inpact than the time to traverse a linked list

2011-10-28T09:00:01  <thestinger> well, C++ has dynamic arrays (vector), lists, queues, deques, sets, maps, etc. just like python
2011-10-28T09:00:06  <thestinger> they're talking about C
2011-10-28T09:00:17  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: reallocationg is bad
2011-10-28T09:00:22  <liberforce> but there's ways to avoid it
2011-10-28T09:00:31  <thestinger> dynamic arrays and linked lists are pretty easy in C but I haven't ever really dealt with hash tables and stuff and I don't think I'd want to deal with that
2011-10-28T09:00:59  <liberforce> thestinger: yeah, hash tables are what worries me most
2011-10-28T09:01:04  <emilk> 14:59 < GeorgeJ> I don't need ordering. I was just thinking that the overhead of reallocating an array would have more of an inpact than the time to traverse a linked list
2011-10-28T09:01:05  <GeorgeJ> who needs hash tables anyway
2011-10-28T09:01:07  <emilk> you'd be surprised
2011-10-28T09:01:25  <GeorgeJ> liberforce: Glib? Gnome library?
2011-10-28T09:01:28  <liberforce> emilk: yeah, depends on the size of the list
2011-10-28T09:01:43  <emilk> doing push_back on a vector a million times compared to a std::list, its much quicker with a std::vector - even without .reserve
2011-10-28T09:01:46  <emilk> bench it
2011-10-28T09:01:49  <liberforce> GeorgeJ: GLib, yeah by GTK, which is used by GNOME
2011-10-28T09:01:57  <thestinger> if you make a proper append() function for your array reallocating isn't a big deal, because you double the size each time
2011-10-28T09:02:15  <emilk> mostly due to cache coherence
2011-10-28T09:02:16  <GeorgeJ> liberforce: Is it lightweight? Isn't there a 2Mb code limit on the bot?
2011-10-28T09:02:32  <liberforce> thestinger: you just need to make sure you won't timeout on that turn ;-)

2011-10-28T09:22:24  <LexHagan> I have kindof an annoying issue with my bot
2011-10-28T09:22:32  <LexHagan> When I issue my orders
2011-10-28T09:22:46  <LexHagan> it seems to accept it as valid
2011-10-28T09:22:53  <LexHagan> but the ant is not moved apparently
2011-10-28T09:22:54  <koh_h_h> can anyone please tell me how to use javascript for programming??
2011-10-28T09:23:07  <LexHagan> i don't really know where to look for the bug
2011-10-28T09:23:15  <Garf> koh_h_h: look at the starter package to get an idea
2011-10-28T09:23:20  <LexHagan> because the output seems to get there (the second order gets recognized as invalid)
2011-10-28T09:23:26  <LexHagan> and the syntax is correct
2011-10-28T09:23:29  <Garf> koh_h_h: basically, toy use node.js to get a commandline program that uses stdio
2011-10-28T09:23:30  <koh_h_h> but it can't load

2011-10-28T09:32:45  <Garf> can't expect it to be explained in every possible language
2011-10-28T09:33:14  <Garf> you still havent explained how you invoke the starter package

2011-10-28T11:07:48  <paulwal> I forked the aichallenge repo, cloned it locally, copied some files into it (did not use git to do this, am i supposed to?), then tried running "git push orgin master"
2011-10-28T11:08:01  <paulwal> $ git remote -v origin  git@github.com:paulwal/aichallenge.git (fetch) origin  git@github.com:paulwal/aichallenge.git (push) upstream        git://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge.git (fetch) upstream        git://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge.git (push)
2011-10-28T11:08:09  <avdg> there is no master ;-)
2011-10-28T11:08:13  <avdg> try git branch
2011-10-28T11:08:32  <paulwal> ah, is master supposed to be a remote?
2011-10-28T11:08:36  <avdg> master is just a branch, git doesn't care about the names of the branches
2011-10-28T11:08:54  <avdg> no, I'm talking here about branches
2011-10-28T11:09:11  <avdg> if I say origin though, its more likely I'm talking about remotes
2011-10-28T11:09:28  <avdg> but don't worry about that, these are some hidden conventions
2011-10-28T11:09:30  <dwins> paulwal: why does your push url differ from your fetch one?
2011-10-28T11:09:31  <paulwal> I'm trying to upload a new starter bot to my forked github repo so i can then send a pull request.  I'll have to read up on branches
2011-10-28T11:09:36  <avdg> just do "git branch"
2011-10-28T11:09:39  <avdg> and push the branch you see
2011-10-28T11:09:47  <dwins> github doesn't allow pushing over git://; you have to use ssh
2011-10-28T11:10:03  <dwins> which corresponds to the git@github... variant
2011-10-28T11:10:17  <paulwal> dwins: one is for 'origin' and the other is for 'upstream'
2011-10-28T11:10:42  <avdg> paulwal: can you repeat the command you tried last?
2011-10-28T11:10:46  <paulwal> I'm only trying to push to the origin
2011-10-28T11:10:57  <paulwal> sure
2011-10-28T11:11:06  <dwins> oh i see, that output is confusing without line breaks
2011-10-28T11:11:06  <avdg> origin is your repo, right?
2011-10-28T11:11:11  <paulwal> yes
2011-10-28T11:11:36  <avdg> just try "git push origin <the branch you see if you do "git branch">"
2011-10-28T11:11:58  <dwins> paulwal: you have committed before trying to push right?
2011-10-28T11:11:59  <paulwal> ok
2011-10-28T11:12:25  <avdg> dwins: in that case, git would tell you there is nothing to update

2011-10-28T11:14:13  <avdg> and didn't notify git about these changes?
2011-10-28T11:14:19  <paulwal> yea
2011-10-28T11:14:20  <avdg> paulwal: thats good
2011-10-28T11:14:32  <avdg> git branch gives you a list of available branches
2011-10-28T11:14:38  <avdg> so
2011-10-28T11:14:43  <avdg> if you want to add these files
2011-10-28T11:14:54  <avdg> do "git add <file>" for every file you want to add
2011-10-28T11:15:03  <paulwal> ahh
2011-10-28T11:15:14  <paulwal> how about directories and edited files?
2011-10-28T11:15:19  <avdg> then do 'git commit -m "<msg>"'
2011-10-28T11:15:23  <avdg> only files
2011-10-28T11:15:30  <paulwal> ok
2011-10-28T11:15:34  <avdg> and only the files you want in the next change or commit
2011-10-28T11:16:06  <avdg> after you ran commit, you can push ;-)
2011-10-28T11:17:02  <paulwal> thanks, I'll try that now.  should i cd into the directory i've copied the file into, or should i be in the project's root directory?
2011-10-28T11:17:21  <paulwal> or does it not matter?
2011-10-28T11:17:31  <avdg> you just cd in the git directory (you can see the .git directory from there)
2011-10-28T11:17:41  <avdg> if you are in a submap, its fine as well

2011-10-28T11:27:26  <Chirmaya> I am wondering when a timeout is occuring. I get these lines:

2011-10-28T11:27:42  <Chirmaya> score 1 3
2011-10-28T11:27:45  <avdg> its the way to notify the owner of the repo, so they can add the changes
2011-10-28T11:27:53  <Chirmaya> status timeout survived
2011-10-28T11:27:53  <bmh> avdg: pull request
2011-10-28T11:27:54  <mrshady1> any chance anyone can help with using VB.net, I have added vbc.exe to my app path but unshore where to put "vbc /define:DEBUG /out:MyBot.exe *.vb"
2011-10-28T11:27:59  <Garf> Chirmaya: if your bot doesnt reply in turntime ms
2011-10-28T11:28:29  <bmh> Is anyone actually peaking at the timer to make sure that they don't time out? I'm just trying to make it fast enough that I can disregard the clock.
2011-10-28T11:28:42  <bmh> %s/peak/peek/g
2011-10-28T11:28:46  <Chirmaya> The variable says I have 1000ms on this local test environment, and at this error my current is at 527ms

2011-10-28T11:29:48  <McLeopold> do you use vs 2010 express?
2011-10-28T11:30:01  <McLeopold> Garf: no, a crash is different from a timeout

2011-10-28T11:30:53  <Chirmaya> Oh
2011-10-28T11:31:09  <Chirmaya> That turn message shows right at the end of a turn, right?
2011-10-28T11:31:42  <Chirmaya> Would that show (assumedly) after the crash occurred?
2011-10-28T11:33:11  <avdg> paulwal: did you created 2 commits?
2011-10-28T11:33:39  <paulwal> Yeah, I just edited the readme file a couple of times and committed it
2011-10-28T11:33:46  <McLeopold> mrshady1: what is the path you used for vbc.exe?
2011-10-28T11:34:22  <avdg> oh well, don't worry about it too much (I know how to fix that though, but its a bit more advantaged)
2011-10-28T11:35:19  <mrshady1> McLeopold it was C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727
2011-10-28T11:36:03  <paulwal> avdg, what do you mean?
2011-10-28T11:36:15  <avdg> nvm
2011-10-28T11:36:48  <avdg> just do your pull request, I hope the pullers will ignore it
2011-10-28T11:36:54  <mrshady1> in the forums it mentions something about adding this to the top of the script ("vbc /define:DEBUG /out:MyBot.exe *.vb") would that be at the top of the bat file script or some other script???
2011-10-28T11:37:20  <McLeopold> I guess you should create a script, probably "make.cmd"
2011-10-28T11:37:34  <McLeopold> then you can just type "make" and it will compile
2011-10-28T11:38:54  <McLeopold> that command makes an exe for me that works

2011-10-28T12:54:17  <paulwal> GerogeJ, that's unfortunate... it'd be nice if we could use stderr for debugging.

2011-10-28T12:55:23  <GeorgeJ> paulwal: I never said you can't
2011-10-28T12:55:45  <GeorgeJ> You just have to stop debuging on the version of the bot you send to the worker
2011-10-28T12:56:03  <GeorgeJ> Have a compilation or runtime flag to toggle debuging or something

2011-10-28T12:56:56  <paulwal> i meant debugging on the server. there seems to be a lot of people saying "it works fine locally, but it crashes on the server and i have no idea why"
2011-10-28T12:57:29  <wilsone> Thanks for the info GeorgeJ, that is probably the issue
2011-10-28T12:58:07  <wilsone> why not just send stderr to /dev/null on the server, why does it even care tho?
2011-10-28T12:58:11  <GeorgeJ> paulwal: I believe you can use a tcp socket or something
2011-10-28T12:58:37  <GeorgeJ> wilsone: Because you usually send something to stderr when there's a problem
2011-10-28T12:59:12  <paulwal> the sandboxing allows opening sockets? wow

2011-10-28T13:00:57  <paulwal> it's be great to output to stderr. you could use it to see what your bot was thinking during important games... Are you sure it doesn't allow this? I haven't uploaded a bot yet, so I haven't tried.
2011-10-28T13:01:55  <GeorgeJ> paulwal: You can always use a tcp server

2011-10-28T13:26:30  <McLeopold> $120 per worker per month
2011-10-28T13:26:38  <antimatroid1> i think it's more people have suggested many times in the past that they're willing to contribute money for servers

2011-10-28T14:05:11  <McLeopold> janzert: I am correct to make the remember me cookie no transfer between computers?
2011-10-28T14:06:31  <janzert> what's the argument for that? I'm rather undecided
2011-10-28T14:07:05  <McLeopold> well, that's how the pull request was coded, pull the cookie from the database and set it if it doesn't exists
2011-10-28T14:07:09  <McLeopold> I'd rather not do that
2011-10-28T14:07:32  <McLeopold> If you sign in on a different machine and select remember me, it should invalidate all other browser cookies everywhere else
2011-10-28T14:07:39  <janzert> no, it should be an opt-in thing when you sign in
2011-10-28T14:07:49  <McLeopold> It was opt in
2011-10-28T14:07:52  <janzert> I don't think it should invalidate other ones though
2011-10-28T14:08:10  <McLeopold> then, the cookies would need to be synced
2011-10-28T14:08:27  <McLeopold> or we store a list of valid cookies for every machine/browser combo
2011-10-28T14:08:32  <janzert> they just should have the same info
2011-10-28T14:08:45  <McLeopold> that feels like a security hole
2011-10-28T14:08:57  <janzert> how?
2011-10-28T14:09:09  <janzert> the user has to trust each machine they're putting it on anyway
2011-10-28T14:09:12  <McLeopold> I said "feel", I don't have a technical answer :)
2011-10-28T14:09:38  <McLeopold> Because if the database was compromised, an attacker has a plain text password
2011-10-28T14:10:06  <janzert> yes, that's true in any case though
2011-10-28T14:10:22  <McLeopold> not if I encrypt the cookie like I do the password
2011-10-28T14:10:29  <janzert> that's why the user has to trust the computer it's on
2011-10-28T14:10:54  <McLeopold> a database compromise it outside the users control
2011-10-28T14:11:06  <janzert> oh you mean our database
2011-10-28T14:11:11  <McLeopold> yes :)
2011-10-28T14:11:14  <janzert> I thought you meant the users cookie database
2011-10-28T14:11:26  <McLeopold> I just assume that is compromised anyway :)
2011-10-28T14:11:50  <janzert> so store it bcrypted on our side the same as the regular password
2011-10-28T14:12:04  <janzert> ahh, ok it finally clicked :)
2011-10-28T14:12:08  <McLeopold> ok, but then I can't sync cookies across machines, which I'm okay with

2011-10-28T14:12:11  <janzert> hmm
2011-10-28T14:12:57  <McLeopold> unless I store mutiple cookies per user
2011-10-28T14:13:34  <janzert> of course compromising the cookie value is much less of a problem than compromising a users password
2011-10-28T14:13:55  <McLeopold> I think it's the same
2011-10-28T14:14:11  <janzert> if a compromise was discovered resetting it isn't a problem in anyway and there is no chance it's reused on another site
2011-10-28T14:14:16  <McLeopold> once your in, you could change the password (when we code it and a forgot password)

2011-10-28T14:25:31  <McLeopold> janzert: it would be nice if the 13 submissions could all vote on it
2011-10-28T14:25:49  <janzert> McLeopold: yes
2011-10-28T14:27:37  <isbric> http://ideone.com/UZ5E7
2011-10-28T14:27:44  <isbric> any ides of how to debug that?
2011-10-28T14:28:49  <McLeopold> isbric: if you logged the bot input files, then you can pipe it back into your bot without the playgame or sandbox framework
2011-10-28T14:28:51  <janzert> McLeopold: what do you think about, if more than half the number of people that have more than 1 submission in that language request the upgrade on the forum and less than 25% disagree then we'll do an upgrade (if and when we can)
2011-10-28T14:29:55  <McLeopold> maybe make a special board for language upgrade requests
2011-10-28T14:30:32  <janzert> amstan_: the above sound good to you?
2011-10-28T14:31:18  <amstan_> janzert: problem is that it's mostly us disagreeing with the upgrades
2011-10-28T14:31:22  <McLeopold> I would say a serious competitor would have to have non-upgradable code, or a beta would have to be proven unstable to prevent upgrading
2011-10-28T14:31:45  <McLeopold> amstan_: that's okay, but at least people have a place to go look at the status
2011-10-28T14:31:59  <McLeopold> we just tag each request with accepted or denied in the title
2011-10-28T14:32:10  <janzert> but mostly I'm disagreeing because of the fear of breaking current submissions
2011-10-28T14:32:38  <amstan_> janzert: the probem i see the most is that they demand an upgrade without any regard on how hard it is to get on ubuntu or stuff like that
2011-10-28T14:32:39  <McLeopold> the worker needs a language check mode
2011-10-28T14:32:58  <McLeopold> well, then a request needs to have that info to be valid
2011-10-28T14:33:20  <janzert> I just mean that if these conditions are met we'll look into doing the upgrade
2011-10-28T14:33:48  <janzert> no guarantee it will be done, just a guarantee it won't be done if the votes aren't met
2011-10-28T14:33:59  <DummySphere> janzert: luajit 2.0.0 beta 5 and beta 8 uses the same language specification Lua 5.1
2011-10-28T14:34:18  <amstan_> janzert: do we have to do this on the forums? what about github issues with the language support tag?
2011-10-28T14:34:21  <janzert> yeah, so do the recent D compilers theoretically ;)
2011-10-28T14:34:48  <janzert> amstan_: I think the forums are more likely to be seen and just seemed easier
2011-10-28T14:34:52  <isbric> McLeopold: would i have to log that myself or is there a lazy flag for that?
2011-10-28T14:35:25  <janzert> don't have anything specific against github issues though, just that it will come up on the forums anyway
2011-10-28T14:37:02  <amstan_> janzert: yeah, but it pretty much means that we'll have to do double the issue reporting work, one in github issues/comments the other as forum replies
2011-10-28T14:37:19  <amstan_> i was just thinking to post a link to the issues on the forums, maybe give some instructions on the procedures
2011-10-28T14:37:35  <janzert> well we can skip the github issues for the most part if we want, forums posts will come regardless
2011-10-28T14:37:37  <McLeopold> isbric: -I is the lazy flag
2011-10-28T14:37:48  <McLeopold> isbric: --log_input is the less lazy flag

2011-10-28T14:38:47  <janzert> but the specifics of how it is done don't really matter much to me, it just might be nice if we can come up with a way for users of a language to agree or disagree on an upgrade being done

2011-10-28T15:09:29  <oh_hi> should winning bots get more playtime?
2011-10-28T15:09:36  <oh_hi> there are so many simple submits
2011-10-28T15:09:50  <oh_hi> and it seems my bots never gets to play a second match
2011-10-28T15:09:54  <Zannick> there was a python3 bug fixed in ~2009
2011-10-28T15:09:55  <oh_hi> -s

2011-10-28T15:10:06  <Zannick> i looked it up when someone reported it earlier
2011-10-28T15:10:12  <oh_hi> well, think about it.
2011-10-28T15:10:13  <Fluxid> i think more gametime get player with higher sigma?
2011-10-28T15:10:15  <janzert> ah

2011-10-28T15:18:29  <janzert> mleise, McLeopold: speaking of the visualizer something I was thinking would be handy is if clicking an "# of ants" could toggle it to show percentage of ants
2011-10-28T15:19:01  <mleise> i was thinking of that too, about 4 weeks ago or so :D
2011-10-28T15:19:08  <janzert> yay :)
2011-10-28T15:19:46  <avdg> could someone tell from where the packages are downloaded? (aka where I can get var download_base)
2011-10-28T15:20:21  <mleise> janzert: there is even a button icon prepared for that case: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer/img/graph_options.png
2011-10-28T15:20:29  <janzert> avdg: hmm, in setup_worker.py?
2011-10-28T15:20:40  <avdg> yeah
2011-10-28T15:20:57  <avdg> (I would like to know how these packages are build)
2011-10-28T15:21:00  <janzert> it's basically the server url /langs
2011-10-28T15:21:22  <janzert> they are prepared by the setup/retrieve_languages.py script
2011-10-28T15:21:38  <McLeopold> janzert: just confirming, but signing out should invalidate a cookie, right
2011-10-28T15:21:59  <janzert> avdg: they're just straight downloads of the various languages distributions
2011-10-28T15:22:08  <janzert> yes
2011-10-28T15:22:13  <avdg> janzert: ty
2011-10-28T15:22:24  <McLeopold> mleise: I was trying to debug when the cutoff counter started, which is why I wanted it
2011-10-28T15:23:00  <McLeopold> It would make the bars when starting a game less jumpy
2011-10-28T15:23:10  <janzert> McLeopold: a debug mode adding food to the ant count displays would probably be best then?
2011-10-28T15:23:34  <McLeopold> I think it is enough of the game that it should be there always
2011-10-28T15:23:45  <McLeopold> I agree with mleise that we are close to too much clutter
2011-10-28T15:24:15  <janzert> that's why having it  a debug mode thing only
2011-10-28T15:24:23  <Xunie`> Is 0,0 the first square in the left top corner or is 1,1?
2011-10-28T15:24:33  <cyphase> (0,0)
2011-10-28T15:24:36  <janzert> by debug mode I mostly mean triggering it with a special url parameter
2011-10-28T15:24:57  <mleise> Well I am busy inventing a new algorithm, so I wont have time for the visualizer :D
2011-10-28T15:25:19  <Xunie`> cyphase, awesome, you're from Vilnius. Just like Ramius from the Hunt for Red October. >_>

2011-10-28T15:46:15  <janzert> it takes about half a dozen game to make it all the way to the top of the rankings, so just give it a day and you'll be in similiar ranked bots

2011-10-28T17:27:22  <savaron> is anyone working on https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/336 ?
2011-10-28T17:28:07  <Zannick> caches are very important
2011-10-28T17:28:58  <mleise> Yes, you don't want to recalculate the paths every turn. You could also distribute them over many turns like some people do.
2011-10-28T17:29:36  <thestinger> yeah, I'm trying to find a good way to do that at the moment
2011-10-28T17:30:00  <mleise> Of course my new algorithm will be so cool and so fast that it can calculate thousands of paths in 500 ms.
2011-10-28T17:30:58  <mleise> Today I had the break through I think. Didn't implement anything, but I have a good feeling.
2011-10-28T17:31:38  <mleise> The experiment with the L1 cache made me start from scratch and that was good :)

2011-10-28T17:35:09  <thestinger> how do you measure distance though? something could be "close" but is really behind a river and you have to navigate a maze to get there :P
2011-10-28T17:35:17  <fasteddie_> not all the ants will need long target path finding all the time
2011-10-28T17:35:23  <mleise> One note about A*: It works best when the costs are different for each graph edge. But in Ants they all cost 1, so there are dozens of equally valued paths that slow down the search.

2011-10-28T17:42:02  <mleise> if any path contains the water square, recalculate it
2011-10-28T17:42:40  <lambdanaut> oic!
2011-10-28T17:43:13  <mleise> lambdanaut: fog is easy: you only get sent information on what is within (or on) the view radius.
2011-10-28T17:43:29  <swinejihad> basically everything except water gets cleared after each turn
2011-10-28T17:43:35  <mleise> (excluding water - that is only sent once because it never changes)
2011-10-28T17:43:57  *** Flort is now known as Sheeple
2011-10-28T17:43:59  <swinejihad> then you have to read the input again to put it back

2011-10-28T17:44:14  <lambdanaut> are other player's bases cleared after each turn?
2011-10-28T17:44:28  <thestinger> you are only sent information about what you see
2011-10-28T17:44:45  <mleise> it's as easy as that, really
2011-10-28T17:44:57  <thestinger> so if you see an enemy hill and die, you don't know if the hill still exists until you can see that square again

2011-10-28T17:45:53  <mleise> of course a hill is so important that you cache that information somewhere and use your A* to move your ants there :)
2011-10-28T17:46:30  <swinejihad> for right now I just disabled clearing the hill information
2011-10-28T17:46:38  * Fluxid didn't use A* at all...
2011-10-28T17:46:48  <mleise> Fluxid: omg, how does that work???
2011-10-28T17:47:06  <swinejihad> it's kinda dumb, but not as dumb as only sending one ant to to attack each hill ;)
2011-10-28T17:47:08  <Fluxid> i think it has a name
2011-10-28T17:48:19  <Fluxid> dunno, maybe it's BFS, but i simply flood-fill starting from destination
2011-10-28T17:48:22  *** Fleem <Fleem!~jerque@i577B44D1.versanet.de> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-28T17:49:16  <mleise> BFS is usually when you first search the closest squares

2011-10-28T17:49:42  <mleise> cyphase: how is that Ants related? :)
2011-10-28T17:49:44  <Fluxid> destination is 0, and then neighouring cells are 1, next are 2 etc
2011-10-28T17:49:47  <cyphase> i wonder if there's comparison of comparison of file comparison tools articles
2011-10-28T17:49:52  <Fluxid> and ants goes to the lower numbers
2011-10-28T17:50:03  <cyphase> mleise, only that i came across it while doing something ants related :)
2011-10-28T17:50:23  <mleise> oh right that article is sooo meta
2011-10-28T17:50:27  <cyphase> lol
2011-10-28T17:50:46  <Fluxid> so i have a map of number which i can cache
2011-10-28T17:50:54  <thestinger> https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Comparison_of_file_comparison_tools&action=historysubmit&diff=457867254&oldid=456368766
2011-10-28T17:50:56  <thestinger> :p
2011-10-28T17:51:35  <Fluxid> i can add few destinations, for example edges of visited cells, so ants always gos to nearest unseen cell
2011-10-28T17:52:41  <Fluxid> every turn i refresh different map
2011-10-28T17:52:47  <fasteddie_> fluxid you can also reuse that for multiple ants with the same destination
2011-10-28T17:52:52  <Fluxid> yup
2011-10-28T17:53:04  <Fluxid> one map directing to hills for all ants
2011-10-28T17:53:38  <mleise> i think this is then called "hill climbing"
2011-10-28T17:53:56  <Fluxid> because hill doesnt move, i don't hve to refresh them so often
2011-10-28T17:54:08  <Fluxid> every fourth turn
2011-10-28T17:54:19  <Fluxid> if map is being discovered

2011-10-28T18:01:19  <thestinger> very cool
2011-10-28T18:01:30  <thestinger> that's way better than doing pathfinding for each ant like I do now
2011-10-28T18:01:38  <Fluxid> and no matter where ant is, it goes to the closest one, i don't have to "find path"
2011-10-28T18:02:35  <bearoff> Fluxid, and what about water? there is not water at your map vision
2011-10-28T18:02:52  <Fluxid> bearoff: ## is either unseen cell or water

2011-10-28T18:11:25  <mleise> i'm not opposed to caching. it's just that I don't want to delay using any new information, that is all
2011-10-28T18:11:28  <Fluxid> because visible radius is 8, i can regenerate map every 4 turns, because map wont outdate in such short time, ant won't be able to reach the edge
2011-10-28T18:11:41  <Fluxid> thestinger: python
2011-10-28T18:12:44  <thestinger> I think for food I'll just do a BFS from the food up to a certain number of steps and send the nearest idle ant it finds to it

2011-10-28T18:17:50  <thestinger> no
2011-10-28T18:17:59  <thestinger> because you need to do a graph search to get the real distance
2011-10-28T18:18:07  <thestinger> he's getting that for free
2011-10-28T18:18:22  <bearoff> no, as your ants are close to visible food
2011-10-28T18:18:34  <bearoff> and bird's distance is a good model
2011-10-28T18:18:42  <Fluxid> bearoff: i tried it
2011-10-28T18:18:48  <bearoff> i use it )
2011-10-28T18:18:51  <Fluxid> but it sucks, because food can be on the other side of water
2011-10-28T18:19:10  <bearoff> yes, this is minus
2011-10-28T18:19:19  <Fluxid> it is close in the straight line, but pathfind may be the longest possible on the map
2011-10-28T18:19:29  <bearoff> I'll do smth with this
2011-10-28T18:19:33  <Fluxid> i tried it at the beginning
2011-10-28T18:20:26  <Fluxid> and some other food may be actually closer, even if int straight line it is farther
2011-10-28T18:21:37  <bearoff> but, if the food is really far from you (over water) and you play with strong player - he will colect it, and it will compensate the problem
2011-10-28T18:22:11  <Fluxid> bearoff: until then my ant thinks about this food and how to get there ;)
2011-10-28T18:22:16  <bearoff> or you will loose it from your look and so can forget about it
2011-10-28T18:22:46  <bearoff> as you can't control it's presence
2011-10-28T18:22:48  <thestinger> bearoff: http://aichallenge.org/strategy_guide.php look at the example they give here in the pathfinding section
2011-10-28T18:23:06  <Fluxid> and i remove food only when location where it should be is visible and this food is no longer there (i remember invisible food)
2011-10-28T18:23:14  <thestinger> if you use euclidean/manhattan distance you end up going to food that is really actually further away
2011-10-28T18:23:29  <thestinger> and then when you move, your ant might end up going back the other way

2011-10-28T19:02:07  <doricatron> web simulator question here. does the "play one move/attach phase" button plays out 1 full turn on 1 click or does it require multiple clicks for 1 turn depending on the situation (attack, gather food etc)
2011-10-28T19:02:11  <thestinger> I'm just doing a BFS from the destination and filling out a map atm

2011-10-28T19:25:13  <analyst74> that's pretty impressive, without combat logic!
2011-10-28T19:25:28  <thestinger> the pathfinding bugs cause weird clumping behavior

2011-10-28T20:44:22  <Fluxid> czxcz i explained my way few screens ago

2011-10-28T20:46:18  <Islacrusez> that's pretty interesting
2011-10-28T20:46:26  <Islacrusez> trippy almost
2011-10-28T20:46:39  <czxcz> yea I agree, thank you, I will ponder about it :)
2011-10-28T20:47:16  <thestinger> yeah, I implemented it (using BFS from targets, and setting each new node to 1 more than the parent) and it works really well

2011-10-28T20:58:32  <Islacrusez> just uploaded a new bot, to see if tutbot>samplebot xD
2011-10-28T20:58:49  <cyphase> Islacrusez, yes
2011-10-28T20:58:56  <Islacrusez> one would really hope so, lol
2011-10-28T20:59:24  <thestinger> Islacrusez: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2255 <- that's basically just what you get from the tutorial + A* pathfinding, dunno why it's doing so well since it doesn't know about enemy ants/combat
2011-10-28T20:59:27  <Islacrusez> while I wait for that game, I'm trying to figure out how to record positions of my ants, and store the information for 2 turns
2011-10-28T20:59:56  <cyphase> what do you mean store it for two turns?
2011-10-28T21:00:24  <Fluxid> Islacrusez: if you move your ant in given direction, you know where your ant will be next, right?
2011-10-28T21:00:50  <Fluxid> what information do you want to store.. for just two turns?
2011-10-28T21:01:07  <McLeopold> mleise: http://aichallenge.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1630 this seems to be a common problem, can you shed some light on this?
2011-10-28T21:01:20  <Islacrusez> I need to know where my ant was last turn, as well as where it will be the next turn, and I simply want to compare the two
2011-10-28T21:02:14  <Fluxid> why
2011-10-28T21:02:26  <Fluxid> have class Ant with attributes row, col
2011-10-28T21:02:33  <Fluxid> first you schedule the moves
2011-10-28T21:02:38  <Fluxid> in directions
2011-10-28T21:02:47  <Fluxid> after you resolve the collisions, you send commands
2011-10-28T21:03:09  <Fluxid> and after sending commands, you change positions in your ant intstances to new
2011-10-28T21:03:24  <McLeopold> I guess I should have made the tutorial worse...

2011-10-28T22:11:39  <lahwran> so this looks really fun, but I don't want to spend a whole bunch of time writing a bot just to lose to other people who are way better at this than me
2011-10-28T22:11:41  <Fluxid> thougc debbuging is hard, without stdin/stdout for pdb

2011-10-28T22:12:24  <Islacrusez> Fluxid: my problem doesn't need a debugger, it needs an idiot less at the keyboard ^^
2011-10-28T22:12:29  <Fluxid> i learned something, that' enough
2011-10-28T22:12:51  <lahwran> also, the website is horribly unclear about what conditions cause what

2011-10-28T22:15:47  <bobbydroptable> its no fun if your bots just wander around in circles

2011-10-28T22:16:19  <Fluxid> bobbydroptable: and my ants literally did circles about hive
2011-10-28T22:16:29  <bobbydroptable> sounds like a sound defense strategy

2011-10-28T22:16:37  <Fluxid> more like squares, but still, running clockwise around
2011-10-28T22:17:20  <Islacrusez> I've written 8 lines of code... I started off with 4, but by the time I debugged them there were 7 and they did nothing

2011-10-28T22:21:29  <avdg> what does that word actually mean?
2011-10-28T22:21:31  <Fluxid> when you gather food and hive is blocked, the number on the right will increase

2011-10-28T22:56:50  <jcdny> yes it works with the flag from the command line, also works via playgame.py if called w/o flags
2011-10-28T22:57:20  <avdg> then its because there is an error with that flag
2011-10-28T22:57:23  <jcdny> It says: File "/Volumes/raid/HD/Users/davis/src/ai/tools/sandbox.py", line 389, in start
2011-10-28T22:57:24  <jcdny>     raise SandboxError('Failed to start {0}'.format(shell_command))
2011-10-28T22:57:24  <jcdny> SandboxError: Failed to start ['MyBot', '-d', '1']
2011-10-28T22:57:34  <avdg> hmm
2011-10-28T22:57:48  <thestinger> doing a BFS from a food on a the _whole_ map is faster for me than doing manhattan distance to each ant (and of course, more accurate)
2011-10-28T22:57:59  <thestinger> from a food across the whole map*
2011-10-28T22:58:09  <avdg> could you put the executable between escaped quotes as well?
2011-10-28T22:58:25  <avdg> "\"./MyBot -d 1\""
2011-10-28T22:58:45  <avdg> I'm just saying something
2011-10-28T22:58:51  <avdg> but lets see
2011-10-28T22:59:29  <avdg> in the other case you have to create a debug executable witch doesn't require flags
2011-10-28T22:59:39  <avdg> *which
2011-10-28T22:59:43  <avdg> bleh
2011-10-28T23:00:43  <jcdny> Nah that does not work either.  andboxError: Failed to start ['./MyBot -d 1']

2011-10-28T23:01:43  <avdg> not sure what the problem is
2011-10-28T23:01:53  <callahan> jcdny: Make a little script with the flag in it
2011-10-28T23:01:58  <jcdny> It does work if I wrap the bot in a shell script and then pass the flags but it's annoying and I was hoping it was something easy
2011-10-28T23:03:08  <avdg> I hope you are using build files
2011-10-28T23:03:28  <avdg> so you don't have to care about the problem

2011-10-28T23:12:29  <Craklyn> Does anyone have tcp servers working on OSX using an AI agent written in Java?
2011-10-28T23:12:49  <Fluxid> server or client?
2011-10-28T23:12:52  <Craklyn> client
2011-10-28T23:13:02  <Fluxid> how do you run it?
2011-10-28T23:13:12  <Craklyn> python tcpclient.py ants.fluxid.pl 2081 'java MyBot' craklyn pword 1
2011-10-28T23:13:24  <Craklyn> or    python tcpclient.py ants.fluxid.pl 2081 'java -jar MyBot.jar' craklyn pword 1
2011-10-28T23:13:29  <Fluxid> what error does it give?
2011-10-28T23:13:32  <Craklyn> your bot (java MyBot) failed to start!
2011-10-28T23:13:41  <Craklyn> Is the only information it gives >.<
2011-10-28T23:13:45  <avdg> heh, my bot finally won http://paste.aichallenge.org/ZXpqV/
2011-10-28T23:13:57  <Fluxid> Craklyn: replace print( 'your bot ('+str(bot_command)+') failed to start!' )
2011-10-28T23:14:00  <Fluxid> with raise
2011-10-28T23:14:09  <Fluxid> and see what error does it give
2011-10-28T23:14:18  <Fluxid> in tcpclient.py
2011-10-28T23:15:08  <Craklyn> Kind of messy, can't tell what the important part is..
2011-10-28T23:15:14  <Fluxid> last line
2011-10-28T23:15:20  <Craklyn> OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
2011-10-28T23:15:32  <Fluxid> duh
2011-10-28T23:15:45  <Fluxid> Craklyn: try to give absolute path to java binary
2011-10-28T23:15:56  <Fluxid> to find it use which java
2011-10-28T23:16:54  <Craklyn> same result
2011-10-28T23:17:12  <Craklyn> sorry, one sec
2011-10-28T23:17:21  <Craklyn> I typo'd.  But after fixing typo, same result too :P
2011-10-28T23:17:40  <Fluxid> :|
2011-10-28T23:18:03  <Fluxid> what command again?
2011-10-28T23:18:07  <xar0l> Craklyn: I had similar problems, do bot_command = bot_command.split()
2011-10-28T23:18:20  <xar0l> seems popen expects a list of arguments
2011-10-28T23:18:25  <Craklyn> My command is:  python tcpclient.py ants.fluxid.pl 2081 '/usr/bin/java MyBot' craklyn pword 1
2011-10-28T23:18:31  <Fluxid> xar0l: it should when shell=False
2011-10-28T23:18:34  <Craklyn> I'll try xar01's suggestion.  One sec..
2011-10-28T23:18:49  <Fluxid> maybe i'm fogeting something

2011-10-28T23:47:48  <bobbydroptable> oooh question question
2011-10-28T23:48:11  <bobbydroptable> does anyone here keep track of the number of food they have in surplus?
2011-10-28T23:48:40  <bobbydroptable> like, if you have 50 food in surplus there really isn't much priority for food
2011-10-28T23:48:59  <bobbydroptable> but that would be quite difficult to track.
2011-10-28T23:50:00  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.11091 wtf
2011-10-28T23:50:20  <Fluxid> bobbydroptable: no, i don't keep track of food... no need, the more food, the more ants
2011-10-28T23:51:08  <Fluxid> anyway, i wonder what happened to my bot in replay above... not attacking at all, wtf
2011-10-28T23:51:16  <bobbydroptable> but if you have lots of food already wouldn't you want to priority attack over more food
2011-10-28T23:51:28  <bobbydroptable> after all, the goal of the game is to raze hills, not get more ants
2011-10-28T23:51:42  <Fluxid> ah no, it was attacking... but bad route!
2011-10-28T23:51:43  <Fluxid> wtf
2011-10-28T23:52:39  <bobbydroptable> guess it would be too late to modify the engine to give clients the number of food they have
2011-10-28T23:53:21  <thestinger> you could try keeping track of it yourself - add one when you get food, subtract one if an ant is on one of your hills at the start of the turn?

2011-10-28T23:53:33  <thestinger> for each hill ofc
2011-10-28T23:53:37  <bobbydroptable> there's a few assumptions that need to be made though
2011-10-28T23:53:45  <bobbydroptable> that you actually were able to get the food
2011-10-28T23:54:11  <bobbydroptable> and that the ant of the hill was actually one that spawned
2011-10-28T23:54:13  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-28T23:54:24  <thestinger> well, I prevent my ants from stepping onto my own hills
2011-10-28T23:54:43  <bobbydroptable> ah
2011-10-28T23:54:50  <thestinger> it would be hard to figure out if you actually got the food though
2011-10-28T23:54:59  <bobbydroptable> yeh
2011-10-28T23:55:08  <bobbydroptable> i was thinking, since the information is already in the visualizer/engine
2011-10-28T23:55:14  <bobbydroptable> maybe we could just pass the information to the client
2011-10-28T23:55:29  <bobbydroptable> but i'm not sure if that will crash existing clients that aren't coded to take that information
2011-10-28T23:55:38  <thestinger> does food spawn faster if it's being eaten?
2011-10-28T23:56:07  <thestinger> right now I stop getting food if I know I have no hills left, but I'm not sure if that's helping my opponents a lot
2011-10-28T23:56:09  <Fluxid> 05:54:12 < bobbydroptable> and that the ant of the hill was actually one that spawned ← if you keep track of your ants, you know if new ant appeared on the hill
2011-10-28T23:57:52  <thestinger> ugh c++
2011-10-28T23:58:27  <thestinger> I've been prototyping in python and it takes 3-5x as many lines to get the same stuff done in C++ :P
