2010-10-16T00:05:34  <krokkrok> hi
2010-10-16T00:05:43  <yellowseed> here.
2010-10-16T00:06:18  <yellowseed> maybe honolulu-18 is the 18th patriotic representative honolulu?
2010-10-16T00:06:47  <yellowseed> i don't know.  my bot has dropped rank from 100 to 900 since i submitted it.
2010-10-16T00:06:59  <krokkrok> doh
2010-10-16T00:07:38  <krokkrok> i was wondering about honolulu-18 since I am here in waikiki right now
2010-10-16T00:08:16  <krokkrok> ooh i just beat oldman5, i hate that old guy always stomping on my dreams
2010-10-16T00:11:11  <yellowseed> yeah, teach him a lesson!
2010-10-16T00:11:41  <krokkrok> i just peeled out on his lawn! hahahaah!!

2010-10-16T00:24:36  <krokkrok> well, its oldman
2010-10-16T00:25:53  <rwa> oldman is a tough bot
2010-10-16T00:26:05  <krokkrok> mean mean oldman
2010-10-16T00:26:05  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-16T00:26:24  <bhasker> though my new version is doing quite well i must say
2010-10-16T00:26:34  <rwa> if he jumps out to an early lead on me - which is most of the time, I never recover
2010-10-16T00:26:57  <bhasker> what is your bots name rwa?
2010-10-16T00:26:58  <rwa> I have big plans.  Big plans I tell you!!
2010-10-16T00:27:01  <rwa> vortex
2010-10-16T00:27:09  <bhasker> aah
2010-10-16T00:27:18  <bhasker> interesting bot, i learnt quite a bit from watching your bot
2010-10-16T00:27:23  <rwa> so we meet again.. bwahahah
2010-10-16T00:27:43  <bhasker> my bot is renamed now
2010-10-16T00:27:48  <bhasker> runs under the codename of malazan!
2010-10-16T00:28:00  <rwa> ah, yeah, that's a strong bot
2010-10-16T00:28:22  <bhasker> yea i rewrote the core of my bot
2010-10-16T00:28:28  <McLeopold> I might have AntBot 2 up in a few minutes.
2010-10-16T00:28:40  <bhasker> nice want to see how my bot does against antbot now
2010-10-16T00:28:49  <bhasker> crowbot i think it holds its own quite well
2010-10-16T00:28:59  <McLeopold> Yeah, but it's stupid.
2010-10-16T00:29:24  <bhasker> how is antbot smarter?
2010-10-16T00:29:29  <McLeopold> Once it starts attacking a planet, it just keeps going.

2010-10-16T00:29:58  <bhasker> punch through eh?
2010-10-16T00:30:12  <McLeopold> Yeah, it usually works, but not always.
2010-10-16T00:30:46  <bhasker> yeah
2010-10-16T00:30:54  <krokkrok> who's bot is honolulu?
2010-10-16T00:30:58  <bhasker> mostly if the other bot gives up for a second and the planet flips to you
2010-10-16T00:31:04  <bhasker> it usually is enough to turn the tide
2010-10-16T00:32:08  <rwa> well that was cool
2010-10-16T00:32:16  <rwa> one line of code just doubled the speed of my bot
2010-10-16T00:33:29  <rwa> I might not timeout 75% of the games on main server now :p
2010-10-16T00:33:31  <krokkrok> beat up by an oldman again :(
2010-10-16T00:34:12  <krokkrok> my bot spends almost no time thinking. its retarded
2010-10-16T00:35:24  <foucist> sounds like it's thinking-cycles challenged
2010-10-16T00:35:27  <bhasker> if you are not searching game tree there really isn't much thinking to do
2010-10-16T00:35:45  <bhasker> its just like can i get this planet-> yes/no, attack
2010-10-16T00:35:56  <bhasker> can i hold this planet -> yes/no attack
2010-10-16T00:36:09  <bhasker> and if i have ships left over where should i send them
2010-10-16T00:36:14  <bhasker> thats pretty much the core of my bot
2010-10-16T00:36:57  <foucist> throw in some strategy!
2010-10-16T00:37:01  <krokkrok> my bot isnt even that clever, its more about action than determine who kills who
2010-10-16T00:37:16  <foucist> strategy = constraining your opponents actions so their choices are predictable!
2010-10-16T00:38:50  <Epona> aka code in more situations
2010-10-16T00:39:37  <yellowseed> my submission, mid september, did only one thing correctly: if at all possible, protect a planet that is under attack from being taken.  everything else it does is stupid.
2010-10-16T00:40:25  <yellowseed> now i keep trying small tweaks to make it beat itself, but it really needs some proper future-tree (bhasker: "game tree"?)
2010-10-16T00:40:44  <yellowseed> i'm not sure i can call it "state space", but maybe that's what it is.
2010-10-16T00:41:33  <krokkrok> every time i try to make my bot look into the future, it becomes too defensive and loses more :(
2010-10-16T00:42:21  <yellowseed> the only way to consistently beat my bot is to be smart about which enemy planets you attack - and approximately 900 bots are doing that.
2010-10-16T00:44:00  <yellowseed> krokkrok: i haven't used future-looking for anything other than defending the planets i already have, so i may have fallen into the same strategic flaw as yourself.
2010-10-16T00:44:52  <yellowseed> we both need more sophisticated ways of deciding how to respond to future states than just "don't let the enemy take what's mine."
2010-10-16T00:46:44  <krokkrok> i took out my code that made a planet defend *itself* and my win ratio goes up.  i dont know why
2010-10-16T00:47:38  <jesionaj`> overcounting needed ships?
2010-10-16T00:47:45  <yellowseed> do you make neutral or enemy planets conquer themselves?
2010-10-16T00:49:47  <krokkrok> i think the math is correct, but, logic says it cant be because abandoning a planet when there is a very strong enemy plant close by seems like a bad idea

2010-10-16T01:06:38  <yellowseed> from you McLeopold? yes :-)
2010-10-16T01:07:00  <McLeopold> You said earlier "don't let the enemy take what's mine."
2010-10-16T01:07:18  <McLeopold> It's all yours.  Every planet.
2010-10-16T01:07:24  <yellowseed> yes, that's what my last submission tries to do.
2010-10-16T01:07:27  <yellowseed> ah-
2010-10-16T01:07:29  <yellowseed> -nice.
2010-10-16T01:07:41  <McLeopold> Defense code is attack code.
2010-10-16T01:08:00  <yellowseed> so... suddenly it's tricky again: to decide which planets get priority.
2010-10-16T01:08:46  <yellowseed> it's not as simple as growth_rate or proximity,
2010-10-16T01:08:56  <McLeopold> My official submission just tries to growth.  It doesn't know who's who, just what it hasn't taken yet.
2010-10-16T01:09:10  <yellowseed> some sort of ... i don't know.  it's fun to think about different ways to approach-

2010-10-16T01:10:54  <McLeopold> No, it's not.  It knows how a planet switching hands effect the growth difference.
2010-10-16T01:10:54  <yellowseed> thanks!  i hope to meet you in the top 100 some day soon.
2010-10-16T01:11:23  <McLeopold> are you on tcp?
2010-10-16T01:11:28  <yellowseed> oh.. ok..
2010-10-16T01:11:57  <yellowseed> i played once on tcp, just to see that the new planetwars kit (thanks ulope and apinkin) tcp script works.
2010-10-16T01:12:02  <yellowseed> (it does)
2010-10-16T01:12:28  <yellowseed> you play a few different strategies under different names on tcp, right?
2010-10-16T01:12:33  <McLeopold> Keep playing on it.  You should run into one of my bots.

2010-10-16T01:16:15  <yellowseed> yes, the most legible language will trump all others!
2010-10-16T01:16:43  <McLeopold> I can develop quickly in python.  I'm not slowed down by type checks.
2010-10-16T01:16:56  <McLeopold> I just toss lists and dictionaries around like...
2010-10-16T01:17:05  <McLeopold> something...

2010-10-16T01:26:04  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: are you trying a different approach in your new bot? i need some inspiration to re-do my bot again
2010-10-16T01:26:30  <Epona> layers
2010-10-16T01:27:09  <McLeopold> what does your current bot do, at a high level
2010-10-16T01:27:11  <rwa> I'm reworking my bot significantly...
2010-10-16T01:27:54  <rebelxt_> current production bot is pretty simple - simulation of the future
2010-10-16T01:28:24  <rwa> huge design space around that idea though...
2010-10-16T01:28:36  <rebelxt_> calculating ships needed, surplus, etc and making decisions on what to do next
2010-10-16T01:28:51  <McLeopold> you could rewrite your forwarding logic
2010-10-16T01:29:30  <rebelxt_> i have 4 versions of forwarding/funneling logic ;-) but yeah, there is another idea in the works
2010-10-16T01:29:42  <McLeopold> Have you solved close starts?
2010-10-16T01:30:46  <McLeopold> You could find better openings to some of your games?
2010-10-16T01:31:13  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: mostly. i normally win close starts but there is still an issue
2010-10-16T01:31:48  <rwa> as far as simulating the future, the real question is:  what does the future hold?
2010-10-16T01:32:16  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: yeah openings need attention. using knapsack plus greedy (like most people probably do)
2010-10-16T01:32:52  <McLeopold> what's greedy?
2010-10-16T01:34:08  <rebelxt_> greedy is no dynamic programming. just pick best move, execute, then see if there are many enough ships left for next best move, etc
2010-10-16T01:34:36  <McLeopold> oh
2010-10-16T01:34:50  <McLeopold> and dp is rearranging until you got the most
2010-10-16T01:34:57  <rebelxt_> right
2010-10-16T01:35:11  <McLeopold> those are the bots I snipe :)
2010-10-16T01:35:56  <rebelxt_> my bot is pretty simple.. there are a bunch of heuristics though to handle sniping, anti-sniping, close starts, early funneling, etc, etc
2010-10-16T01:36:01  <Epona> whats napsack
2010-10-16T01:36:03  <McLeopold> You could try and play positionally
2010-10-16T01:36:27  <McLeopold> Epona: given 100 ships, which planets should you choose to give you the most growth
2010-10-16T01:36:34  <rebelxt_> what i'm Epona, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem
2010-10-16T01:36:55  <rebelxt_> err merged two sentences into one ;)
2010-10-16T01:37:59  <Epona> ah
2010-10-16T01:38:17  <Epona> so its a way of looking at your tactics
2010-10-16T01:39:15  <rebelxt_> Epona, knapsack just helps you solve ship allocation problem a bit better than greedy algorithms
2010-10-16T01:42:24  <Epona> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
2010-10-16T01:42:28  <Epona> another good one^
2010-10-16T01:43:07  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: good ideas. i'm experimenting in most of these directions. too bad there is not enough time with work/etc. maybe i will take a couple of days vacation in November and drill into this
2010-10-16T01:45:51  <rebelxt_> Epona: yeah shortest path is useful when funneling through intermediate hops (which i could not make work as good as direct funneling)
2010-10-16T01:46:30  <Epona> summation is the key
2010-10-16T01:46:34  <Epona> imo

2010-10-16T01:58:27  <McLeopold> You might consider rolling your own framework
2010-10-16T01:58:43  <McLeopold> That's how I can get new bots built really fast.
2010-10-16T01:58:51  <jukkerknott> keep a template?
2010-10-16T01:59:17  <jukkerknott> i do have a generic one i just copy... so I guess I sort of do?
2010-10-16T01:59:58  <McLeopold> Well, push stuff to functions that you can mix a match.

2010-10-16T02:00:40  <McLeopold> I've got a few funneling routines.  I can switch them in and out.
2010-10-16T02:00:46  <jukkerknott> then just switch between different functions (enable/disable) for different behaviours
2010-10-16T02:00:47  <jukkerknott> right
2010-10-16T02:01:14  <McLeopold> Plus, then you can start turning pieces on or off depending on the situation of the game.
2010-10-16T02:01:20  <jukkerknott> how are you guys doing funnelling? atm I'm just doing some dot-products to keep within a set deviation from course
2010-10-16T02:01:32  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3561), MariusCG(3472), deepblue(3409), Hazard(3357), felixcoto(3315), ofrias(3311), Alvraro(3307), ruilov(3298), savchenko(3298), fglider(3278)
2010-10-16T02:01:43  <jukkerknott> A* or dijkstra's?
2010-10-16T02:01:53  <McLeopold> dot product?
2010-10-16T02:01:59  <jukkerknott> yeah
2010-10-16T02:02:10  <jukkerknott> just to make sure that my angles are below a limit
2010-10-16T02:02:12  <McLeopold> isn't that for adding vectors?
2010-10-16T02:02:17  <jukkerknott> no
2010-10-16T02:02:22  <jukkerknott> but
2010-10-16T02:02:39  <jukkerknott> you can calculate the cosine between two vectors easily
2010-10-16T02:03:19  <jukkerknott> then i just make sure that my potential path nodes are in the limit
2010-10-16T02:03:21  <McLeopold> I struggled with how not to send fleets at a 90 degree angle, instead of forward.
2010-10-16T02:03:54  <jukkerknott> hmm

2010-10-16T02:04:30  <McLeopold> Well, if you know the direction you want them to go, then just go there.
2010-10-16T02:04:51  <McLeopold> Use A*
2010-10-16T02:05:01  <McLeopold> That should find the shortest path.
2010-10-16T02:05:04  <Epona> can ships change direction

2010-10-16T02:22:51  <antimatroid> yes, that would be horrible
2010-10-16T02:22:56  <antimatroid> strategy wise
2010-10-16T02:23:06  <jukkerknott> yeah
2010-10-16T02:23:08  <rwa> the space is so wide open already
2010-10-16T02:23:28  <antimatroid> it would kind of be cool if growth proportional rather than constant
2010-10-16T02:23:48  <jukkerknott> proportional to what?
2010-10-16T02:23:53  <rwa> current pop I guess
2010-10-16T02:23:56  <antimatroid> number of ships on the planet
2010-10-16T02:24:06  <antimatroid> but i think you might end up with close starts always being draws
2010-10-16T02:24:07  <jukkerknott> that would give a huge disadvantage to the trailer though..
2010-10-16T02:24:12  <rwa> well that would certainly change things...
2010-10-16T02:25:29  <antimatroid> this tree bot is giving me worlds of pain to even get it up and running
2010-10-16T02:25:47  <antimatroid> it wont even generate the tree without crashing at this point :|
2010-10-16T02:26:13  <jukkerknott> damn
2010-10-16T02:26:14  <jukkerknott> that sucks
2010-10-16T02:26:32  <antimatroid> i only started it yesterday, i'll get it there, i just hate fixing things
2010-10-16T02:26:45  <rwa> a tree bot will take a few days...
2010-10-16T02:27:29  <rwa> I had an epic idea for how to improve my tree bot, but I doubt I can finish the calcs in 1 sec...
2010-10-16T02:28:06  <antimatroid> i think the code is to the point of testing once i get bugs ironed out
2010-10-16T02:28:22  <antimatroid> it's a complete mess from me changing things to calculate it for either player though
2010-10-16T02:28:47  <rwa> ah, are you modeling the opponent on a tree too?
2010-10-16T02:29:02  <antimatroid> i'm doing minimax, i need them to make moves :P
2010-10-16T02:29:21  <antimatroid> well, approximate minimax, can't check every move at every turn
2010-10-16T02:29:25  <rwa> right
2010-10-16T02:29:43  <rwa> so the the question is what level of approx to choose for the opponent so things don't get out of hand...
2010-10-16T02:29:58  <antimatroid> to start with each player will be doing under 10 turns each
2010-10-16T02:30:01  <antimatroid> i will see how that goes
2010-10-16T02:31:11  <antimatroid> i may even just run 2 layers (moves for each player in each layer) then run those terminal nodes with one move per player to try and evaluate those nodes

2010-10-16T04:53:50  <rabidus> i mean ... hmm
2010-10-16T04:53:51  <antimatroid> then how?
2010-10-16T04:54:06  <antimatroid> you wont know who your opponent is during the final contest, so not updating for specific players

2010-10-16T04:54:29  <antimatroid> any estimation of the opponent really needs to be done per game

2010-10-16T07:30:32  <antimatroid> i'm ready to rage quite the universe

2010-10-16T07:31:03  <bhasker> the usual work day and couldn't sleep
2010-10-16T07:31:06  <bhasker> so fixing bugs in my bot
2010-10-16T07:31:36  <antimatroid> delt0r_: no idea sorry, tcp <3

2010-10-16T07:31:52  <delt0r_> thx
2010-10-16T07:32:25  <antimatroid> it will make a move now tough, which was better than no moves before

2010-10-16T07:36:07  <Migi32> 5 games per minute is actually quite alright for 1 server, considering if everyone would use the 1 second we'd end up with 2000 seconds cpu time, which is 33 minutes
2010-10-16T07:36:56  <delt0r_> Migi32: yes... but with more than 1000 players... its not really enough... eps with mulitcore and all that...
2010-10-16T07:36:59  <Migi32> so as the contest progresses and people use more cpu time, I guess it's more logical that the number of games per minute drops
2010-10-16T07:37:56  <Bobng> the one server is also the web server
2010-10-16T07:38:00  <Bobng> running very modest hardware
2010-10-16T07:38:07  <Bobng> so don't blame it if it is slow.
2010-10-16T07:38:10  <delt0r_> which is a problem
2010-10-16T07:38:16  <Migi32> delt0r, so what do we do? deactivate everyone who hasn't logged in for > 2 weeks? buy more servers?
2010-10-16T07:38:33  <delt0r_> Migi32: perhaps both?
2010-10-16T07:38:46  <delt0r_> Its not a personal attack
2010-10-16T07:38:57  <delt0r_> I undersand universitys... i work at one
2010-10-16T07:39:06  <Bobng> You need to remove all bots that crash a lot
2010-10-16T07:39:21  <Bobng> and you need j3camero to be around
2010-10-16T07:39:26  <Bobng> so i can offer him a vps.
2010-10-16T07:39:31  <antimatroid> hmmm, i just did a rather depressing calculation
2010-10-16T07:39:34  <delt0r_> and i think some kind of "login" keep alivie counter
2010-10-16T07:39:47  <Migi32> antimatroid, what is that?
2010-10-16T07:40:14  <antimatroid> if you branch 5 moves per turn, by the end of the third layer you have 5^(25) terminal nodes
2010-10-16T07:40:35  <antimatroid> that's almost 3*10^(17) nodes
2010-10-16T07:40:42  <antimatroid> that's never going to happen
2010-10-16T07:40:43  <sigh> welcome to exponential growth!@
2010-10-16T07:41:09  <delt0r_> Its just at this point with so few games played, i won't prioritize my bot... and do other things instead
2010-10-16T07:41:10  <Migi32> 5^25? Isn't it more like 5^6?
2010-10-16T07:41:12  <antimatroid> wait, i may have been retarded
2010-10-16T07:41:25  <Migi32> or what do you mean by "third layer"?
2010-10-16T07:41:29  <sigh> oh yeah, here did you get 5^25 from?
2010-10-16T07:41:40  <antimatroid> yeah, nevermind
2010-10-16T07:41:50  <antimatroid> i went over the top aha
2010-10-16T07:42:02  <sigh> haha
2010-10-16T07:42:09  <Migi32> yea, it's 5^6, which is "only" 15625
2010-10-16T07:43:18  <antimatroid> i am getting less than 1000 processes of states each turn atm, but i haven't gone through and fixed stupid passing of data either
2010-10-16T07:43:35  <sigh> only 1000?
2010-10-16T07:43:36  <antimatroid> i'm also only picking 1 turn per state atm too
2010-10-16T07:43:50  <antimatroid> yes, i think it's due to passing data around stupidly though
2010-10-16T07:44:01  <sigh> ah fair enough

2010-10-16T07:45:12  <antimatroid> it didn't feel right though, cause of chess ai's etc.
2010-10-16T07:45:21  <sigh> why on earth were you raising anything to the 25th power?
2010-10-16T07:45:34  <antimatroid> 5^(5^5)
2010-10-16T07:45:41  <Migi32> lol

2010-10-16T07:46:17  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-10-16T07:46:25  <sigh> this is what happens to pure maths students, they forget how to work with actual numbers
2010-10-16T07:46:51  <antimatroid> i'm not even allowed calculators in most of my maths exams anymore :|

2010-10-16T07:47:20  <sigh> well, makes sense for some subjects
2010-10-16T07:47:31  <antimatroid> yep, not really any numerical questions
2010-10-16T07:47:33  <delt0r_> I let students have cals in my exams... but if they think they need them... they did it wrong
2010-10-16T07:47:44  <sigh> delt0r_: what do you teach>
2010-10-16T07:47:46  <sigh> ?
2010-10-16T07:47:56  <delt0r_> Physics and undergrad math
2010-10-16T07:48:00  <delt0r_> programming
2010-10-16T07:48:02  <antimatroid> dlet0r: that's the way exams should be (possibly minus the allowing the calculator)
2010-10-16T07:48:11  <Migi32> yea, here too. In my first year as an undergrad, we could use computers for the exams of almost every course (and do algebraic stuff the easy way), but as time progresses we can use them less and less
2010-10-16T07:48:12  <delt0r_> these days just population genetics
2010-10-16T07:48:18  <sigh> wow, that's quite a broad range
2010-10-16T07:48:21  <antimatroid> although i'm talking analysis and algebra classes where the calculator is just useless
2010-10-16T07:48:52  <delt0r_> its what happens to physici folk that don't do global warming or LHC

2010-10-16T07:51:24  <sigh> not to mention programmable ones
2010-10-16T07:51:29  <delt0r_> Migi32: My tests (if the universty will let me) are all open book
2010-10-16T07:51:38  <delt0r_> I don't like testing memory
2010-10-16T07:51:59  <delt0r_> however network phones are an issue
2010-10-16T07:52:33  <delt0r_> using friends on online networks to cheat is becoming a problem
2010-10-16T07:52:59  <Migi32> do calcs have wireless networks nowadays?
2010-10-16T07:53:06  <delt0r_> Iphones doo
2010-10-16T07:53:10  <delt0r_> etc
2010-10-16T07:53:20  <Migi32> you shouldn't allow iphones then
2010-10-16T07:53:25  <Migi32> or any phone for that matter
2010-10-16T07:53:32  <delt0r_> well that is a university policiy problem
2010-10-16T07:53:45  <delt0r_> they are baning them now
2010-10-16T07:53:56  <gat3way> when I was at the university
2010-10-16T07:54:03  <gat3way> a student was caught cheating
2010-10-16T07:54:13  <gat3way> with a very small speaker stuck into his ear

2010-10-16T07:54:25  <delt0r_> but some students claim they need it for the "language" to English dictionary
2010-10-16T07:54:25  <antimatroid> wtf, i have never heard of a university allowing a phone as a calculator
2010-10-16T07:54:26  <gat3way> he went into the hospital because he was unable to get it out of his ear
2010-10-16T07:54:41  <antimatroid> my uni allows lecturers to specify different kinds of calculators that students are allowed
2010-10-16T07:54:52  <antimatroid> you wont get much more than a scientific calc in a maths exam if that

2010-10-16T07:55:08  <sigh> delt0r_: if they need one, then it should be a paper dictionary
2010-10-16T07:55:26  <delt0r_> anyway... university's that i worked for are pretty slack at taking undergrad cheating seriously
2010-10-16T07:55:26  <sigh> having an ipone for that is completely ridiculous
2010-10-16T07:55:32  <sigh> :(
2010-10-16T07:55:34  <delt0r_> sigh: thats what i said
2010-10-16T07:56:28  <delt0r_> the uni get the fees either from the government or from the students for each student in the class... so they don't want to throw them out
2010-10-16T07:56:41  <sigh> yeah, that sucks
2010-10-16T07:56:54  <Migi32> same here.
2010-10-16T07:57:05  <Migi32> we used to have entrance exams before you could enter

2010-10-16T07:57:13  <delt0r_> but I always make it a point to fail them and not let them into my classes...

2010-10-16T08:00:57  <antimatroid> have you got very far at implementing the mixed strategy nash equilibria idea?
2010-10-16T08:01:19  <sigh> who's doing that? Migi32?
2010-10-16T08:01:23  <Migi32> antimatroid, simplex: done. nash equilibria: done. However, turns out it's way too slow...
2010-10-16T08:01:31  <antimatroid> ah, bugger

2010-10-16T08:01:45  <antimatroid> simplex is too slow?
2010-10-16T08:01:51  <antimatroid> i was still considering that for move selection
2010-10-16T08:02:04  <Migi32> ah yes for small problem's it's quite fast
2010-10-16T08:02:21  <antimatroid> first move? :P
2010-10-16T08:02:22  <Migi32> so for nodes where each player has like < 20 options, it's fast enough
2010-10-16T08:02:38  <gat3way> how many games do my bot play daily on the average?
2010-10-16T08:03:00  <antimatroid> hundreds if you play on tcp

2010-10-16T08:03:07  <Migi32> for each 50 options however, it uses about 0.15 seconds, for 150 you hit 1 second

2010-10-16T08:42:51  <phreeza> it would be cool if there were a tcp server with say 30s timeout
2010-10-16T08:42:58  <phreeza> would like to see how it plays then
2010-10-16T08:43:11  <bhasker> so why do you even consider partial moves phreeza
2010-10-16T08:43:18  <bhasker> i see that your tree searching bot
2010-10-16T08:43:24  <bhasker> is sending a few ships at neutrals
2010-10-16T08:43:39  <phreeza> bhasker: yea as i said its a very dumb first shot
2010-10-16T08:43:48  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-16T08:43:53  <bhasker> so no pruning of bad moves?
2010-10-16T08:43:54  <phreeza> it just draws random numbers
2010-10-16T08:43:55  <bhasker> i guess
2010-10-16T08:43:59  <bhasker> ah
2010-10-16T08:44:08  <phreeza> and sees what is the best one...
2010-10-16T08:44:17  <sigh> yeah, next step should give smarter random moves :)
2010-10-16T08:44:25  <phreeza> i was just stress testing my tree implementation ;)
2010-10-16T08:44:31  <sigh> :)
2010-10-16T08:44:44  <phreeza> just found out about transposition tables this morning though...
2010-10-16T08:44:56  <phreeza> but i think maybe its not worth it in this case
2010-10-16T08:45:06  <sigh> I wouldn't think so
2010-10-16T08:46:26  <sigh> how many game simulations does it run in a second?
2010-10-16T08:47:16  <phreeza> right now about 10k but i think i have a way of making it about 10 times faster
2010-10-16T08:47:28  <phreeza> thats on a 2GHz C2D
2010-10-16T08:47:38  <gat3way> my bot is too weak :(
2010-10-16T08:47:47  <sigh> i see... that's a bit lower than I would have expected :(
2010-10-16T08:48:46  <phreeza> i was hoping for more, too...
2010-10-16T08:49:53  <phreeza> right now the game engine i use for simulations is just a 1:1 translation of the official Java engine... i think i can tweak it a bit, but i have serious doubts i will ever get more than maybe 200k nodes
2010-10-16T08:50:56  <sigh> oh, so each fleet is an object and all that?
2010-10-16T08:51:03  <phreeza> yea :)
2010-10-16T08:51:22  <sigh> yeah, you'll get a lot more performance if you improve your data structures
2010-10-16T08:52:28  *** otherAntimatroid <otherAntimatroid!~Jet@ppp118-208-202-50.lns20.hba1.internode.on.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-10-16T08:52:35  <phreeza> another cool thing would be if i could reuse branches from previous rounds, but that only works if i guessed the opponents moove exactly, of course
2010-10-16T08:53:10  <sigh> branching factor is so high that the benefit will be negligible, imo
2010-10-16T08:54:39  <sigh> if I was running a simulation, to store fleets I would set up an array indexed [planet][turn][player]... one off allocation of array size [NUM_PLANETS][MAX_TURNS][2]
2010-10-16T08:56:03  <sigh> (where the elements of the array are ship counts)
2010-10-16T08:56:37  <phreeza> yea that sounds about right...
2010-10-16T08:57:02  <sigh> that should be way more than 10x improvement

2010-10-16T09:34:56  <bhasker> yea was just watching that game
2010-10-16T09:35:00  <Bobng> sends ships in a triangle, routing them through 3 planets to get to a planet which is closer
2010-10-16T09:35:03  <Bobng> top left
2010-10-16T09:35:29  <bhasker> hmm hold on let me see
2010-10-16T09:35:30  <Bobng> from turn 56 onwards
2010-10-16T09:35:58  <Bobng> otherwise its pretty good
2010-10-16T09:36:18  <bhasker> i am not sure which routing you are talking about
2010-10-16T09:36:32  <bhasker> at turn 56 i have a bunch of ships headed to the top left
2010-10-16T09:36:34  <bhasker> planet
2010-10-16T09:36:55  <Bobng> yeah, the bot routes ships up to the top planet
2010-10-16T09:37:03  <Bobng> from the bottomish one
2010-10-16T09:37:06  <Bobng> through another one
2010-10-16T09:37:14  <Bobng> then the top planet sends them down to a smaller planet
2010-10-16T09:37:22  <Bobng> which is close to the original planet
2010-10-16T09:37:32  <Bobng> making the round trip pointless?
2010-10-16T09:37:58  <bhasker> ah thats because i stage to that planet
2010-10-16T09:38:03  <bhasker> those ships were on their way
2010-10-16T09:38:11  <bhasker> before i figured that i needed to save that corner planet
2010-10-16T09:38:22  <Bobng> ahh
2010-10-16T09:38:34  <bhasker> it works well mostly
2010-10-16T09:38:37  <bhasker> but in some split maps
2010-10-16T09:38:39  <bhasker> like this
2010-10-16T09:38:44  <bhasker> it does stupid things like that

2010-10-16T13:15:51  <Azrathud> Which one is harder?

2010-10-16T13:18:13  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure this will work quite well once i get it going
2010-10-16T13:18:20  <antimatroid> i have built the heuristic side in quite well
2010-10-16T13:18:22  <a1k0n> in fact i've written about five revisions to my bot since 0.4.1 and abandoned them before running them
2010-10-16T13:18:51  <antimatroid> although the new dmj bot looks damn fierce
2010-10-16T13:19:02  <antimatroid> i had a hard enough time getting over the older versions
2010-10-16T13:21:05  <antimatroid> it takes a lot longer to see the result of a game now
2010-10-16T13:21:14  <antimatroid> and i'm only giving it 0.3 seconds of tree generation :|
2010-10-16T13:23:00  <phreeza> I just finished my first tree searching bot but it is incredibly bad
2010-10-16T13:23:10  <phreeza> the stuff it does makes no sense at all
2010-10-16T13:23:11  <phreeza> :)
2010-10-16T13:24:17  <antimatroid> i look forward to these results :P
2010-10-16T13:25:33  <phreeza> how many nodes do you get with 0.3s?
2010-10-16T13:25:42  <Azrathud> Maybe it's so incredibly artificially intelligent that you can't pick out its reasons for making the moves it does.
2010-10-16T13:26:30  <phreeza> Azrathud: If it has become self aware and decided to commit suicide, then it is extremely efficient
2010-10-16T13:26:50  <phreeza> it just has a major but
2010-10-16T13:27:38  <Azrathud> Uh, there's not but in your statement.
2010-10-16T13:27:43  <Azrathud> no*
2010-10-16T13:29:53  <Azrathud> Implied but?
2010-10-16T13:33:02  <antimatroid> phreeza: i literally just got the tree working without crashing :P
2010-10-16T13:33:21  <antimatroid> i have it making only 2 moves per node atm, one of which is to do nothing
2010-10-16T13:33:53  <phreeza> Azrathud: should there be a but?
2010-10-16T13:34:14  <phreeza> antimatroid: ah ok, for me every node is a move
2010-10-16T13:34:20  <phreeza> or rather, every edge
2010-10-16T13:34:42  <phreeza> or you mean every node has 2 children?
2010-10-16T13:35:33  <Azrathud> phreeza: it just has a major but <- I think 'but' should refer to an actual 'but' in a sentence.
2010-10-16T13:36:04  <phreeza> oh... s/but/bug/
2010-10-16T13:36:20  <Azrathud> Ah.
2010-10-16T13:36:59  <antimatroid> phreeza: yeah, current branching of 2 children per node
2010-10-16T13:37:03  <antimatroid> but that will be ramped up
2010-10-16T13:37:11  <antimatroid> i'm not sure i can really go above 5 if even that
2010-10-16T13:37:25  <antimatroid> i can run "terminal" nodes if necessary
2010-10-16T13:37:40  <Azrathud> I guess vi is popular around here, unless s/but/bug/ is a general regular expression. When I typed your name out, I realized it was probably fron dragon ball.
2010-10-16T13:38:22  <phreeza> s/but/bug/ is originally a sed command, i think
2010-10-16T13:38:35  <phreeza> but works in vim too
2010-10-16T13:39:14  <phreeza> i've been asked that about my nick before... came up with it before i had heard of dragonball
2010-10-16T13:39:24  <Azrathud> Ah.
2010-10-16T13:40:46  <phreeza> antimatroid: i grow my tree probabilistically, sounds good in theory but turns out to suck, so far at least
2010-10-16T13:42:04  <phreeza> we should set up a tcp server for searching bots with a 30s time limit just to see what they come up with
2010-10-16T13:42:47  <Azrathud> Why 30s? Is the other 30 required for something else?
2010-10-16T13:42:52  <antimatroid> i'm not touching anything like that till i get this up and running
2010-10-16T13:43:03  <antimatroid> i am happy with 1 second for the moment
2010-10-16T13:46:39  <Gudradain> yea tree searching :)
2010-10-16T13:46:55  <Gudradain> I would love to have an idea how to do one right
2010-10-16T13:49:19  <Gudradain> anyone tried genetic?
2010-10-16T13:49:42  <phreeza> theres a forum post, but don't know if that ever went anywhere
2010-10-16T13:50:58  <Gudradain> I did a genetic program once before, it was to separate a series of weight equally I think
2010-10-16T13:52:17  <Gudradain> but well, for each iteration it found a solution and used some of the best solution with some mutation to get a new one. but I just don't see how this method can be applied to this game
2010-10-16T13:52:42  <Gudradain> would it have to run the game to the end? or just 1 or a few turn is enough?

2010-10-16T13:53:27  <phreeza> i think he is doing genetic programming to develop the actual bot
2010-10-16T13:53:49  <phreeza> Java, shocking...
2010-10-16T13:54:14  <Zannick> well, C/C++ is just one behind...
2010-10-16T13:54:20  <foucist> people code what they know

2010-10-16T14:06:27  <yellowseed> Azrathud: you mean you have one bot written in a combination of python and c++?  or you have two bots, and you use the tcp server to test them out?
2010-10-16T14:09:17  <Azrathud> yellowseed: I have two bots, but it's more like I'm just playing around on the c++ one and working on the python one.
2010-10-16T14:15:28  <antimatroid> i just beat my normal heuristic bot without having even done much of what i want for move selection yet

2010-10-16T20:08:38  <antimatroid> i'm still working on stuff but here's some test games http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=testbot
2010-10-16T20:08:58  <bhasker> uploaded my current tcp version to official servers now that cloud servers are up
2010-10-16T20:09:01  <bhasker> lets see how high it can go
2010-10-16T20:09:13  <antimatroid> that bot is using minimax
2010-10-16T20:09:23  <antimatroid> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=524797 is probably the better win so far
2010-10-16T20:09:26  <gerald512k> what is this server ? it is unofficial ?
2010-10-16T20:09:32  <antimatroid> yes
2010-10-16T20:09:52  <bhasker> very nice antimatroid
2010-10-16T20:09:58  <bhasker> its already beating 300+ elo rated bots
2010-10-16T20:10:11  <gerald512k> it is kind agressive
2010-10-16T20:10:15  <bhasker> heck it even beat honolulu-19
2010-10-16T20:10:18  <bhasker> #1 rated bot
2010-10-16T20:10:19  <contestbot> bhasker: I have no idea what you mean.
2010-10-16T20:10:35  <antimatroid> it will still get a fair bit better
2010-10-16T20:10:44  <gerald512k> have you a lot of experience in programing?
2010-10-16T20:11:38  <gerald512k> kinda crazy gam

2010-10-16T20:12:56  <gerald512k> ok
2010-10-16T20:12:59  <phreeza> antimatroid: nice!
2010-10-16T20:13:13  <phreeza> my searching one is working now, too... more or less
2010-10-16T20:13:15  <gerald512k> i decided to make this bot because i wanted to learn a programing language so i am learning java
2010-10-16T20:13:21  <phreeza> looks a lot less organized than yours
2010-10-16T20:13:28  <phreeza> and a lot weaker

2010-10-16T20:26:17  <yellowseed> you don't upload (as far as i know) but play through a network connection from your own computer.
2010-10-16T20:33:08  <bhasker> hmm antimatrioid but i guess it doesn't do anything if its already winning
2010-10-16T20:33:13  <bhasker> so it will just wait out the 200 turns?
2010-10-16T20:33:31  <bhasker> cause a lot of games seem to run to 200 turns
2010-10-16T20:39:54  <antimatroid> yeah, i tried to tell the payoff function not to do that, but its difficult
2010-10-16T20:39:59  <antimatroid> it still loses stupid games anyway
2010-10-16T20:40:21  <antimatroid> and it's really grumpy about redistributing

2010-10-16T20:45:32  <bhasker> but its interesting to watch it
2010-10-16T20:45:45  <bhasker> it does things that seem illogical when you look at it,but it wins
2010-10-16T20:46:17  <bhasker> the weird part is it does partial moves
2010-10-16T20:46:21  <bhasker> why burn ships against neutrals?
2010-10-16T20:46:54  <bhasker> how does that factor into a minimax system?
2010-10-16T20:47:47  <bhasker> won't it be better to prune moves that don't result in any kind of increase in growth or ships?
2010-10-16T20:50:06  <antimatroid> when it made the move it would have thought it was going to take the neutral

2010-10-16T23:05:38  <deepblue> will probably let something run on the tcp later tonight

2010-10-16T23:15:08  <Sorian> Fixed my issue. C++ files require a blank line at the end of the file on Unix apparently.
2010-10-16T23:18:46  <Blkt> yes
2010-10-16T23:18:56  <Blkt> that's specified on some standard I don't remember
2010-10-16T23:18:58  <Blkt> maybe POSIX?

2010-10-16T23:21:14  <deepblue> more like C++ standard?
2010-10-16T23:21:46  <Blkt> the blank line at the end of the stuff?
2010-10-16T23:22:25  <deepblue> yep
2010-10-16T23:22:57  <Blkt> I remembered it was on some sort of standard
2010-10-16T23:23:13  <Blkt> also, emacs puts a blank line at the end of whatever file you create
2010-10-16T23:24:02  <deepblue> it has todo with the include
2010-10-16T23:24:20  <deepblue> if you include the file content just gets inserted there without an additional new line after the content
2010-10-16T23:24:55  <deepblue> so that's why there should be a new line at the end of every file :)
