2012-04-25T15:50:27  <pairofdice> GRRR
2012-04-25T15:50:43  <pairofdice> who is this mysterious GR
2012-04-25T15:50:57  <mcstar> amstan: i read all the interesting books from this village's library when i was a kid
2012-04-25T15:51:08  <mcstar> pairofdice: general relativity
2012-04-25T15:52:22  <mcstar> anyway, im not going near people when it is not absolutely necessary
2012-04-25T15:52:24  <mcstar> so no library
2012-04-25T15:52:34  <mcstar> i have plenty of books here at home
2012-04-25T15:53:37  <mcstar> amstan: is this john carter the same as the movie?
2012-04-25T15:53:48  <mcstar> ah, you were asking about it some time ago werent you?
2012-04-25T15:53:53  <amstan> mcstar: there's a bunch of changes
2012-04-25T15:54:04  <mcstar> some guy from mars right?
2012-04-25T15:54:07  <amstan> yes
2012-04-25T15:54:19  <amstan> k, this mango sucks
2012-04-25T15:54:20  <amstan> it's all sour
2012-04-25T15:54:37  <mcstar> tango
2012-04-25T15:54:53  <mcstar> tango and cash, excellent choice for an evening movie
2012-04-25T15:56:17  <mcstar> amstan: did you see my screenshots from yesterday?
2012-04-25T15:56:41  <amstan> no
2012-04-25T15:56:59  <mcstar> amstan: i did a 8x12 widget benchamrk
2012-04-25T15:57:30  <amstan> i have something like that for another widget i had
2012-04-25T15:57:37  <mcstar> it wasnt bad, but as time passed, and more and more line segments needed to be redrawn, it became a bit slow to response
2012-04-25T15:57:46  <amstan> it was just a composite widget(it had 1 button and 3 scrollbars in a layout)
2012-04-25T15:57:53  <amstan> 8x12 widgets is slow
2012-04-25T15:58:22  <mcstar> i added new points every 123ms
2012-04-25T15:58:30  <mcstar> so yeah, it became slow
2012-04-25T15:59:14  <mcstar> maybe you will need to draw offline, and show parts of an image
2012-04-25T16:08:52  <mcstar> amstan: or you can just sacrifice a bit of interactivity, and having buttons around to pan and zoom in larger steps
2012-04-25T16:09:11  <amstan> ?
2012-04-25T16:09:53  <mcstar> it wont feel slow that way
2012-04-25T16:10:21  <mcstar> you dont have to redraw everything for pixel-wise panning
2012-04-25T16:10:23  <mcstar> or zooming
2012-04-25T16:10:40  <mcstar> you zoom/pan 10 pixels at a time
2012-04-25T16:13:25  <mleise> what are you both working on, amstan and mcstar? I've seen some graphs in a window
2012-04-25T16:14:05  <mcstar> mleise: we are both working on a bit similar jobs
2012-04-25T16:18:57  <mleise> In Ants, I didn't redraw everything on panning
2012-04-25T16:19:34  <amstan> mleise: yeah, i'm going to be reconding this sometime
2012-04-25T16:19:45  <amstan> i tried to keep the code clear instead of speedboosts

2012-04-25T16:20:22  <mleise> but those nasty ants were moving every frame, so it was difficult to cache the image
2012-04-25T16:21:54  <mcstar> mleise: how did you cache?
2012-04-25T16:22:20  <mleise> I cached the static stuff, like the map
2012-04-25T16:22:54  <mleise> zooming slowed down a bit, because at high zoom levels the redraw of the whole map took a while
2012-04-25T16:23:36  <mcstar> ok, so you had a background and foreground

2012-04-25T17:57:06  <thestinger> the xfce one is probably a lot lighter
