2012-01-23T13:56:48  <amstan> i started a second instance of contestbot without realizing it, so they were ghosting eachother

2012-01-23T14:00:13  <Zannick> perhaps
2012-01-23T14:04:37  <McLeopold> amstan: the contestbot pages doesn't have a link to the logs
2012-01-23T14:05:12  <amstan> McLeopold: i installed arch on my server this weekend, still haven't finished doing all the permissions
2012-01-23T14:05:20  <amstan> only the folder listing is broken
2012-01-23T14:05:28  <amstan> but if you go in /channellogs i think they're all there
2012-01-23T14:05:28  <McLeopold> oh
2012-01-23T14:05:47  <amstan> yeah: http://contestbot.aichallenge.org/channellogs/%23aichallenge/
2012-01-23T14:05:50  <McLeopold> I've been debating moving my system from gentoo to arch/ubuntu
2012-01-23T14:06:06  <amstan> arch seems nice
2012-01-23T14:06:17  <McLeopold> I like minimalizm
2012-01-23T14:06:57  <McLeopold> But ubuntu would match the contest server, so I might just do that so I only have to memorize one setup
2012-01-23T14:16:05  <amstan> it doesn't really matter
2012-01-23T14:16:15  <amstan> just get a ubuntu vm
2012-01-23T14:16:25  <thestinger> arch just ships the upstream configs so there isn't really anything to learn
2012-01-23T14:17:08  <thestinger> figuring out the debian way of doing things can be annoying :P
2012-01-23T14:17:28  <amstan> thestinger: that's not exactly true, you have to learn every single small tool that you never bothered to learn in ubuntu
2012-01-23T14:17:56  <amstan> like.. i found out the hard way that an unpatched grub cannot boot from an mdadm raid array
2012-01-23T14:18:14  <amstan> or that getting hibernate and suspend working is a fairly involved task
2012-01-23T14:18:39  <thestinger> echo mem > /sys/power/state
2012-01-23T14:18:41  <thestinger> :P
2012-01-23T14:19:10  <thestinger> grub sucks a lot
2012-01-23T14:19:34  <thestinger> fedora is basically the only other distro using grub-legacy by default and they patch the hell out of it

2012-01-23T14:26:11  <amstan> so the only way for me to install grub2 is to repartition my drive
2012-01-23T14:26:21  <amstan> and i wasn't about to do that after the installer finished
