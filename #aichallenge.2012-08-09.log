2012-08-09T09:04:22  <Arieta> could someone fill me in about the next contest, I remember reading in the forum that it was planned for this Fall right?
2012-08-09T09:10:12  <antimatroid1> Arieta: there are currently no plans sorry
2012-08-09T09:10:44  <Arieta> Oh... that's too bad :(
2012-08-09T09:10:54  <antimatroid1> eventually something will happen
2012-08-09T09:11:06  <antimatroid1> some stuff to do with being a non-profit etc. needs to be sorted first
2012-08-09T09:11:09  <antimatroid1> and at present nothing is happening
2012-08-09T09:18:55  <mcstar> ofc, in the meantime you could write a general purpose AI, so you could handle any problem when the next contest is out
2012-08-09T09:21:08  <Arieta> Actually I've been making a talking clock for the past few months while waiting :D
2012-08-09T09:21:39  <mcstar> what did it say?
2012-08-09T09:23:08  <mcstar> a talking clock that motivates you to get out of bed is probably a great business idea
2012-08-09T09:23:23  <Arieta> I tried to make it sounds like my mom when I didn't wake up for work
2012-08-09T09:23:36  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-09T09:24:10  <Arieta> but it didn't seem to be very... convincing. Well a real mother pulling the sheet out of your half naked body morning sure serve as a better alarm clock
2012-08-09T09:24:19  <Arieta> xD
2012-08-09T09:24:40  <mcstar> 'howard! get out of the bed already! your little friends are waiting for you in the institute!' << imagine this in wolowitz's mother's tone
2012-08-09T09:25:03  <Arieta> lol
2012-08-09T09:27:53  <Arieta> btw, the idea of a talking clock that motivates you every morning is already implemented by the japanese I think
2012-08-09T09:28:14  <Arieta> heck they even have a doll that would bow and say "welcome home, master" everytime you come back...
2012-08-09T09:32:09  <mcstar> lets make rubik cube, that has a massive loudspeaker in it
2012-08-09T09:32:34  <mcstar> you activate it, by sufficiently scramlbling it
2012-08-09T09:32:51  <mcstar> and in the morning you have to solve it to deactive it
2012-08-09T09:33:07  <mcstar> deactivate*
2012-08-09T09:33:36  <mcstar> i dont think you go back to bed after solving such a puzzle
2012-08-09T09:34:26  <mcstar> and ofc, make it from an 'unbreakable' material
2012-08-09T09:34:27  <Arieta> I... can't solve rubik cubes T_T
2012-08-09T09:34:45  <mcstar> then, it sucks to be you in the morning
2012-08-09T09:35:07  <Arieta> xD
2012-08-09T10:07:20  <antimatroid1> i can't solve them either
2012-08-09T10:08:57  <antimatroid1> well that was an interesting bmx race
2012-08-09T10:09:00  <antimatroid1> all but one person fell
2012-08-09T10:09:59  <mcstar> bmx racing became an olympic game?
2012-08-09T10:10:04  <antimatroid1> yeah
2012-08-09T10:10:08  <antimatroid1> and that was hilarious
2012-08-09T10:10:18  <antimatroid1> one guy got to finish the track casual as fuck
2012-08-09T10:11:01  <mcstar> did he get the silver and bronze medal too, beside the gold?
2012-08-09T10:20:58  <mcstar> 'its the laplace transform of the density of states' << class starts to laugh

2012-08-09T12:22:39  <mcstar> antimatroid1: did you make your graphs?
2012-08-09T12:22:44  <mcstar> just asking...
2012-08-09T12:22:51  <antimatroid1> what?
2012-08-09T12:22:55  <antimatroid1> i haven't programmed anything
2012-08-09T12:22:58  <antimatroid1> if that's what you mean
2012-08-09T12:23:03  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-09T12:23:11  <mcstar> dont be upset, i was just curious
2012-08-09T12:23:38  <antimatroid1> yeah s'all good
2012-08-09T12:23:43  <antimatroid1> i've been busy doing other stuff
2012-08-09T12:23:56  <antimatroid1> i've been counting the number of diagrams
2012-08-09T12:24:10  <antimatroid1> i get 1, 4, 18, 73, 294 i think
2012-08-09T12:24:31  <mcstar> yeah, ok, but those numbers dont mean anything to me
2012-08-09T12:24:50  <antimatroid1> me either yet
2012-08-09T12:24:59  <mcstar> i dont exactly grasped how you 'multiply' the diagrams, if thats what you called it
2012-08-09T12:25:15  <mcstar> didnt/grasp
2012-08-09T12:25:53  <antimatroid1> http://sketchia.com/draw.html#tNJG7XY
2012-08-09T12:25:54  <antimatroid1> as follows
2012-08-09T12:25:59  <antimatroid1> just forget the middle dots
2012-08-09T12:26:04  <antimatroid1> and all loops just get removed
2012-08-09T12:27:06  <antimatroid1> make sense?
2012-08-09T12:27:06  <antimatroid1> it
2012-08-09T12:27:09  <antimatroid1> it's really simple
2012-08-09T12:27:19  <mcstar> ah, ok, i tried to put 2 of these beside each other, not on top of..
2012-08-09T12:28:57  <antimatroid1> so yeah, if i have 3 dots then there's one diagram generated by the one generator (itself), if there's 4 dots along the top then the 2 generators generator 4 diagrams (including themselves)
2012-08-09T12:29:10  <antimatroid1> for 5 i get 18, for 6 i get 73 and for 7 i get 294

2012-08-09T12:35:19  <mcstar> why is that a ball
2012-08-09T12:35:21  <mcstar> ?
2012-08-09T12:36:35  <antimatroid1> field hockey
2012-08-09T12:36:43  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-09T12:36:49  <mcstar> i thought ice hockey
2012-08-09T12:36:59  <mcstar> do you call the gate gate?
2012-08-09T12:37:10  <mcstar> i have no idea, it sounds really out of place
2012-08-09T12:38:18  <antimatroid1> goal?
2012-08-09T12:38:28  <mcstar> thats weird too
2012-08-09T12:38:41  <mcstar> we call the action of the ball passing the goal-line a goal
2012-08-09T12:39:28  <mcstar> i added 2 more balls
2012-08-09T12:39:30  <mcstar> find them
