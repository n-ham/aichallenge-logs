2012-05-06T14:09:33  <thestinger> I found the cs212 unit really easy
2012-05-06T14:09:38  <pairofdice> I went through it yea
2012-05-06T14:09:58  <thestinger> I just used a binary search for the inverse though

2012-05-06T14:10:24  <pairofdice> It's not hard but Norvig's style just confuses me
2012-05-06T14:10:43  <thestinger> ?
2012-05-06T14:10:56  <pairofdice> And it's a bit hard
2012-05-06T14:10:59  <pairofdice> D:
2012-05-06T14:11:20  <thestinger> well, he codes pythonic python
2012-05-06T14:11:26  <thestinger> the other courses haven't used python well
2012-05-06T14:11:31  <thestinger> cs373 especially
2012-05-06T14:11:37  <thestinger> I think that was intentional though
2012-05-06T14:15:02  * thestinger loves for-else
2012-05-06T14:18:33  <thestinger> I was amused by how easy it was to pass the tests for the unit 3 of the web course
2012-05-06T14:19:28  <thestinger> it accepts it if you store ids and redirect
2012-05-06T14:19:38  <thestinger> it doesn't care about the content of the pages at all
2012-05-06T14:19:49  <thestinger> you don't even need to have any html :P
2012-05-06T14:20:36  <thestinger> pairofdice: I've found that the language course is the most challenging due to the somewhat tricky graph searches you have to do
2012-05-06T14:21:10  <thestinger> at least that's how I've implemented my solutions to these things
2012-05-06T14:23:03  <pairofdice> Yeah, I had some difficulties with the graphs
2012-05-06T14:26:15  <pairofdice> But at least there's labels

2012-05-06T14:59:29  <thestinger> no
2012-05-06T14:59:42  <mcstar> what kind of tools then?
2012-05-06T14:59:51  <thestinger> well it's really just a general programming course
2012-05-06T14:59:54  <thestinger> it's actually really good
2012-05-06T15:00:00  <thestinger> mcstar: that unit teaches how to write parsers
2012-05-06T15:00:04  <thestinger> among other things

2012-05-06T15:35:15  <thestinger> decorators aren't recursion
2012-05-06T15:35:22  <thestinger> they're seriously just
2012-05-06T15:35:27  <thestinger> g = f(g)
2012-05-06T15:35:30  <pairofdice> yeah
2012-05-06T15:35:52  <thestinger> lambdas just save you from having to name a nested function

2012-05-06T15:36:02  <thestinger> until python 3, python doesn't have proper closures though
2012-05-06T15:36:09  <thestinger> (the nonlocal keyword)
2012-05-06T15:42:10  <Zannick> python 2 does have closures
2012-05-06T15:42:36  <thestinger> Zannick: yes, but not proper ones
2012-05-06T15:42:46  <Zannick> not sure what you mean
2012-05-06T15:43:14  <thestinger> they can't change stuff in the outer scope
2012-05-06T15:43:21  <thestinger> unless it's mutable
2012-05-06T15:43:23  <Zannick> why would you want to do that
2012-05-06T15:43:40  <Zannick> well
2012-05-06T15:43:50  <Zannick> you can make a closure out of self.func eg.
2012-05-06T15:43:53  <thestinger> because that's what a closure is
2012-05-06T15:44:06  <thestinger> Zannick: yeah, but then it's like java "closures" :P
2012-05-06T15:44:28  <Zannick> no, java closures are Closure<Foo.Bar.Fuckthis>
2012-05-06T15:44:33  <Zannick> :)
2012-05-06T15:44:41  <thestinger> you can get around the lack of nonlocal in py2 though
2012-05-06T15:44:55  <thestinger> just have to use a dict to hold your local vars, and then modify the dict in the nested function
2012-05-06T15:45:20  <Zannick> d = 0
2012-05-06T15:45:24  <Zannick> def f(x):
2012-05-06T15:45:30  <Zannick>     d += x
2012-05-06T15:45:34  <Zannick> ^
2012-05-06T15:45:39  <mcstar> (let ((x 0)) (lambda (y) (incf x y) (format nil "~&~d~%" y)))
2012-05-06T15:46:04  <mcstar> thestinger: or list
2012-05-06T15:46:55  <Zannick> so i've always thought of closures as functions that can be called eventually, where some arguments are filled and maybe touches other things
2012-05-06T15:47:03  <Zannick> eg. functools.partial
2012-05-06T15:47:16  <mcstar> Zannick: you exmaple is not closed over d
2012-05-06T15:47:27  <mcstar> your
2012-05-06T15:47:49  <Zannick> but yeah, python scoping doesn't let you assign because it overwrites in a more local scope
2012-05-06T15:47:57  <Zannick> no?
2012-05-06T15:48:01  <mcstar> not at all
2012-05-06T15:48:19  <thestinger> Zannick: http://sprunge.us/HHcF
2012-05-06T15:48:36  <mcstar> (ofc i can be wrong cause i dont know python that well)
2012-05-06T15:48:48  <mcstar> (but still, that doesnt look like a closure)
2012-05-06T15:48:56  <mcstar> (more like d is a dynamically bound variable)
2012-05-06T15:48:58  <thestinger> without nonlocal it won't work
2012-05-06T15:49:11  <thestinger> x is part of the state of the f function, but g can't modify it
2012-05-06T15:49:27  <thestinger> x += 5 won't work (it will throw an exception, since it's not defined locally)
2012-05-06T15:49:37  <thestinger> x = 10 will make a local var and won't change the outer scope
2012-05-06T15:49:40  <Zannick> ah, yes
2012-05-06T15:49:48  <thestinger> but this will work

2012-05-06T15:50:40  <thestinger> or a dict
2012-05-06T15:50:44  <thestinger> it's just a hack though

2012-05-06T15:51:46  <thestinger> functools.lru_cache is a good example of it
2012-05-06T15:53:42  <mcstar> (lambda x: lambda y: x+y)(2)(4)
2012-05-06T15:53:57  <mcstar> unfortunately x is not mutable from the second lambda
2012-05-06T15:54:15  <thestinger> python lambdas are so bad :P

2012-05-06T16:18:16  <thestinger> you can make recursive list comprehensions
2012-05-06T16:18:29  <thestinger> in python2
2012-05-06T16:19:24  <thestinger> oh I think it was removed in 2.7

2012-05-06T16:22:40  <mcstar> ah yeah, ive seen the local() trick before
2012-05-06T16:22:43  <mcstar> locals*
2012-05-06T16:23:01  <mcstar> im not sure in what kind of problem though
2012-05-06T16:23:05  <thestinger> locals() and globals() are for metaprogramming hacks
2012-05-06T16:24:34  <mcstar> why not just use a language that supports metaprogramming...
2012-05-06T16:25:02  <mcstar> im just saying this is stuff im not supposed to know about python
2012-05-06T16:25:34  <thestinger> well they're in the language for the same reason as eval, being able to compile/decompile to the AST of python, etc.
2012-05-06T16:26:06  <thestinger> http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/ast.html scary
2012-05-06T16:27:02  <mcstar> thestinger: lol, looks much like haskell
2012-05-06T16:31:39  <thestinger> here, something more evil

2012-05-06T16:33:31  <thestinger> with the ast module you can actually change any source code though
2012-05-06T16:33:47  <thestinger> without relying on it having source available

2012-05-06T16:38:58  <mcstar> but yeah, funny
2012-05-06T16:39:13  <thestinger> yeah, ast is for proper self-modifying code though
2012-05-06T16:39:16  <thestinger> that's just a silly hack
2012-05-06T16:40:45  <mcstar> thestinger: if you really want to learn about macros take a look at Paul Graham's On Lisp, and be enlightened
2012-05-06T16:41:08  <mcstar> no, dont just take a look at it, read it!
2012-05-06T16:41:13  <thestinger> later
