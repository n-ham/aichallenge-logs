2010-09-29T00:09:10  <Cyndre> very nice
2010-09-29T00:09:37  <bhasker> and looks like my bot is doing much better on tcp as well
2010-09-29T00:09:41  <bhasker> @36 position now
2010-09-29T00:09:42  <contestbot> bhasker: No!
2010-09-29T00:09:51  <bhasker> ...
2010-09-29T00:11:02  <sigh> haha, shut down
2010-09-29T00:12:57  <a1k0n> _iouri_'s presence doesn't surprise me.  his bot was strong last time
2010-09-29T00:13:07  <a1k0n> bhasker: get a lot done working from home today?  :)
2010-09-29T00:13:46  <bhasker> haha actually my current bot is barely changed:(
2010-09-29T00:13:50  <bhasker> i have to rewrite it
2010-09-29T00:13:59  <bhasker> i just fixed a couple of heuristics
2010-09-29T00:14:03  <bhasker> and a bug i had in the code
2010-09-29T00:14:04  <Sylph> nice, hasker
2010-09-29T00:14:29  * Sylph nods
2010-09-29T00:14:42  <sigh> Sylph nods a lot :P
2010-09-29T00:14:57  <a1k0n> i went through a lot of revisions on my bot with nothing to show for it yet

2010-09-29T00:15:05  <bhasker> though i believe that my current bot is doing okay on tcp only because a lot of the bots in the top 30 are not playing right now
2010-09-29T00:15:06  <a1k0n> but i think i have an idea of what i want to do now at least
2010-09-29T00:15:46  <Sylph> I'm a very very agreeable person, sigh. :D
2010-09-29T00:15:47  <bhasker> i wish i had a more mathematical bent of mind:(
2010-09-29T00:15:50  <Sylph> hrm
2010-09-29T00:15:50  <sigh> a1k0n: it took you this long to figure out you wanted to win? :D
2010-09-29T00:15:56  <Sylph> nm
2010-09-29T00:16:09  <Sylph> i meant more someone who like to agree and stuff :P
2010-09-29T00:16:12  <a1k0n> heh.  i was drawing a blank on an actual approach for a while
2010-09-29T00:16:19  <Sylph> mmm
2010-09-29T00:17:01  <Sylph> what rank are oyu now a1kon ?
2010-09-29T00:17:16  <Sylph> omg wednesday already :|
2010-09-29T00:17:17  <Sylph> hrm
2010-09-29T00:17:22  <Sylph> how am i going to get time to code my bot >.<
2010-09-29T00:17:24  <Cyndre> when you upload a new bot why doesnt it fight someone around the level of your old bot?
2010-09-29T00:17:32  <Sylph> not sure
2010-09-29T00:17:34  <Sylph> that'll be helpful
2010-09-29T00:17:39  <Sylph> not wasting time :/
2010-09-29T00:17:44  <Cyndre> yea
2010-09-29T00:17:56  <a1k0n> Sylph: dunno, it keeps bouncing around like crazy
2010-09-29T00:18:01  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-29T00:18:04  <Sylph> it don't stabilize ?
2010-09-29T00:18:06  <a1k0n> i haven't uploaded since the day the contest started
2010-09-29T00:18:06  <sigh> that's on the list of stuff to be fixed, I think
2010-09-29T00:18:11  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-29T00:18:12  <a1k0n> not... really
2010-09-29T00:18:24  <Sylph> mine seems to staabilize at slightly above 300
2010-09-29T00:18:29  <sigh> (playing bots your own level for new submission)
2010-09-29T00:18:30  <Sylph> and stays around there
2010-09-29T00:18:58  <sigh> a1k0n is sandbagging, he was in the top 10 earlier
2010-09-29T00:19:10  <a1k0n> dude i wish
2010-09-29T00:19:16  <sigh> :P
2010-09-29T00:19:33  <a1k0n> there is no rational explanation for why a1k0n-0.2 is any good
2010-09-29T00:19:41  <a1k0n> but that's what's up there
2010-09-29T00:20:13  <a1k0n> i just realized this morning that october comes before november
2010-09-29T00:20:22  <a1k0n> and thus we have a lot of time left
2010-09-29T00:20:28  <sigh> :)
2010-09-29T00:20:52  <antimatroid> :P
2010-09-29T00:20:58  <antimatroid> so much more time
2010-09-29T00:21:52  <sigh> I need to make something so that my bot can optimise parameters by itself and leave it going for a few weeks
2010-09-29T00:23:28  <Cyndre> whats with the invalid input on the server
2010-09-29T00:24:48  <antimatroid> sigh: we're planning to do something like that, still not entirely sure how
2010-09-29T00:25:04  <antimatroid> as in how to update the parameters, pretty obvious "how" to do it
2010-09-29T00:25:25  <sigh> that's the trouble with all these ideas, isn't it?
2010-09-29T00:25:26  <antimatroid> that didn't make any sense, we know how to change them, not how to "optimally" update them
2010-09-29T00:25:45  <bhasker> hah http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=214639
2010-09-29T00:25:46  <sigh> I know what you mean
2010-09-29T00:25:59  <antimatroid> not always, still struggling to find ways to do things, let alone refining the heuristics side of it
2010-09-29T00:26:11  <sigh> well there are a gazillion algorithms out there to search through arbitrary state-spaces
2010-09-29T00:26:45  <antimatroid> yeah, but most aren't going to help for this
2010-09-29T00:26:51  <antimatroid> you need to reduce the search space a buttload
2010-09-29T00:26:56  <sigh> never claimed it would :P
2010-09-29T00:27:50  <antimatroid> i think i might do some programming this afternoon, now that my test is out of hte way
2010-09-29T00:27:55  <antimatroid> i got owned on a linear operators question :(

2010-09-29T00:30:14  <bhasker> wtf http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4939011 :(
2010-09-29T00:30:23  <bhasker> how did i lose that one:-\
2010-09-29T00:30:53  <sigh> ah, the timeout of DOOM
2010-09-29T00:31:07  <bhasker> my bot doesn't timeout for sure
2010-09-29T00:31:11  <bhasker> at that level
2010-09-29T00:31:31  <antimatroid> nah, server problem, not yours
2010-09-29T00:31:33  <bhasker> there aren't even enough fleets going around
2010-09-29T00:31:38  <sigh> lots of people having the same problem: http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=807
2010-09-29T00:31:58  <antimatroid> yet as far as I know timeout is still disqualification in final tournament
2010-09-29T00:32:18  <sigh> antimatroid: j3camero said it was just a loss
2010-09-29T00:32:20  <sigh> yesterday
2010-09-29T00:32:33  <antimatroid> ah, well i'm glad that has changed

2010-09-29T00:44:34  <antimatroid> how do vectors work in c++? is it a really bad idea to be removing elements from the front of one?
2010-09-29T00:44:43  <antimatroid> computation time wise
2010-09-29T00:48:43  <sigh> antimatroid: I think so, I think you want queue instead
2010-09-29T00:49:04  <medice> or some linked list
2010-09-29T00:49:24  <sigh> "Vector containers are implemented as dynamic arrays; Just as regular arrays, vector containers have their elements stored in contiguous storage locations"
2010-09-29T00:49:29  <jmcarthur> deque has constant time access to the ends, iirc
2010-09-29T00:49:40  <jmcarthur> but i could be remembering wrong
2010-09-29T00:49:51  <antimatroid> hmmm, a lot of people are just allocating memory for all turns at the start aren't they?
2010-09-29T00:49:59  <jmcarthur> in haskell i would reach for a finger tree
2010-09-29T00:49:59  <medice> double ended queue, yeah
2010-09-29T00:50:03  <antimatroid> i would do that, but i'm reluctant to with the number of turns potentially changing
2010-09-29T00:50:29  <Zannick> circular buffers :D
2010-09-29T00:51:07  <antimatroid> i would be a big fan of the band of radius for games
2010-09-29T00:51:08  <jmcarthur> i really hope that we at least get the number of turns specified as part of the game state
2010-09-29T00:51:22  <antimatroid> i was hoping we wouldn't but understand why you would want it
2010-09-29T00:51:30  <jmcarthur> why not?
2010-09-29T00:51:32  <sigh> a c++ queue uses deque by default, it seems
2010-09-29T00:51:36  <Janzert> I how not too :)
2010-09-29T00:51:47  <jmcarthur> i don't mean a static number
2010-09-29T00:51:49  <antimatroid> cause i don't like players optimising for the end of the game, it should be a battle to the death
2010-09-29T00:51:50  <Janzert> just tell the bots the length
2010-09-29T00:51:56  <jmcarthur> i mean what you mean, Janzert
2010-09-29T00:52:01  <Janzert> ahh, ok
2010-09-29T00:52:02  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: but we can't do that
2010-09-29T00:52:14  <antimatroid> you could have a band of radius
2010-09-29T00:52:27  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: without a specified number of turns, what would you say the goal you are optimizing for should be?
2010-09-29T00:52:31  <jmcarthur> "band of radius"?
2010-09-29T00:52:36  <antimatroid> say after t turns, then if distance between growth and ships is greater than x then one player wins
2010-09-29T00:52:46  <jmcarthur> else?
2010-09-29T00:52:48  <antimatroid> otherwise keep playing and reduce the size of x till it gets to like 50 ships or so
2010-09-29T00:52:51  <antimatroid> then it's a draw
2010-09-29T00:53:10  <jmcarthur> that'd be okay maybe, but complicated
2010-09-29T00:53:21  <antimatroid> not that complicated
2010-09-29T00:53:35  <antimatroid> and leaves the game as one of trying to eliminate the enemy, rather than just beat them on ship coutns
2010-09-29T00:53:45  <jmcarthur> you'd still end up with the best bots superoptimizing for the endgame condition and it would effectively be the same as having a turn limit, i predict

2010-09-29T00:54:36  <jmcarthur> i did like the suggestion on the mailing list that would make games where one player is winning on ship count but the other on growth makes the game a draw
2010-09-29T00:54:36  <antimatroid> frankly, i care less about which way these decisions go than actually getting a definitive answer

2010-09-29T00:56:31  <jmcarthur> i mainly just don't want the scenario that j3camero suggested on the mailing list, where we have an entirely unknown endgame condition...
2010-09-29T00:56:38  <jmcarthur> *almost entirely
2010-09-29T00:56:47  <sigh> jmcarthur: what was that?
2010-09-29T00:56:52  <antimatroid> i am fine with that, provided we know before hand what it is
2010-09-29T00:56:55  <jmcarthur> intentionally unspecified turn count
2010-09-29T00:57:00  <jmcarthur> sigh ^^
2010-09-29T00:57:06  <sigh> ah
2010-09-29T00:57:16  <antimatroid> before hand that that's how it's going to be, that is :P
2010-09-29T00:57:20  <bhasker> antimatroid use a priority Q
2010-09-29T00:57:24  <bhasker> implemented using a min heap
2010-09-29T00:57:25  <sigh> move 1, DRAW, move 1, DRAW, move 1, DRAW!
2010-09-29T00:57:30  <Janzert> unspecified in the specification but given to the bot in the game is fine with me
2010-09-29T00:57:35  <jmcarthur> me too
2010-09-29T00:57:40  <jmcarthur> but that didn't seem to be the proposal
2010-09-29T00:57:41  <antimatroid> bhasker: for what? storing future states?
2010-09-29T00:57:43  <sigh> c++ stl has priority queue
2010-09-29T00:57:54  <Janzert> which is what I thought j3camero meant but maybe not
2010-09-29T00:58:02  <bhasker> well i use it a lot in my bot to prioritize stuff
2010-09-29T00:58:02  <antimatroid> yes, i'm using one for potential moves in my naive version

2010-09-29T00:58:43  <antimatroid> i love being able to just define an operator on a struct and then just throw them into a prique, makes my life so much easier
2010-09-29T00:58:43  <davidjliu> ha, I'm catching back up to you sigh
2010-09-29T00:58:45  <jmcarthur> Janzert: my impression is that a lot of people think that having a turn limit at all is a bad thing and a few people are suggesting that making the turn count an unknown would force people to code as if there is no turn count
2010-09-29T00:58:57  <jmcarthur> Janzert: but i disagree with that idea
2010-09-29T00:59:09  <sigh> davidjliu: 3 elo points!
2010-09-29T00:59:16  <antimatroid> you can't not have a turn limit, as some games will go infinitely
2010-09-29T00:59:21  <antimatroid> not even trivially
2010-09-29T00:59:36  <jmcarthur> agreed, which is why people are suggesting an unknown turn limit rather than no turn limit
2010-09-29T00:59:45  <antimatroid> yep, that's what I want
2010-09-29T00:59:54  <antimatroid> and i tihnk the band of radius with that would be best
2010-09-29T01:00:02  <antimatroid> cause you could allow longer games when necessary
2010-09-29T01:00:18  <jmcarthur> we could actually settle this pretty easily by declaring any game which ends without complete dominance to be a draw
2010-09-29T01:00:23  <Janzert> hmm, yeah. There has to be a length limit somehow and I think it is certainly best for the bot to be able to tell what it is
2010-09-29T01:00:27  <jmcarthur> even if it's 10000 vs 1 on the last turn
2010-09-29T01:00:40  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: that's crappy idea
2010-09-29T01:00:48  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: at least it's not arbitrary
2010-09-29T01:00:50  <Janzert> even then I'd want a bot to be able to tell what the limit is
2010-09-29T01:00:55  <antimatroid> band of radius!!!
2010-09-29T01:01:02  <jmcarthur> Janzert: yeah
2010-09-29T01:01:35  <sigh> is there any plan to pass that info into bots?

2010-09-29T01:01:36  <Janzert> and if the length of the games could be significantly longer I think making them all draws would be fine too
2010-09-29T01:01:48  <antimatroid> you could even have another inner band saying if you're within this, it's a draw
2010-09-29T01:01:50  <jmcarthur> meh whatever. i strongly disagree with an unknown turn limit, and only mildly disagree with most other suggestions

2010-09-29T01:03:11  <jmcarthur> oh, and i strongly agree with telling the bots about any turn counts
2010-09-29T01:03:35  <Zannick> ahahaha, contestbot sounds like he's tired of posting that link
2010-09-29T01:03:51  <antimatroid> hmmmm.. what about if we had a longer turn limit with no bots knowing it and if you make it there without a definitive answer then it's a draw? that way your optimal strategy is to win no matter what time it is, and it's still reasonable to make "long term" moves if that's what would eventually win, as presumably that also keeps you alive?
2010-09-29T01:04:18  <antimatroid> but adds a large emphasis on finishing your games fast
2010-09-29T01:04:26  <sigh> I'm in favor of command line arguments
2010-09-29T01:04:41  <Janzert> I should really respond to that comment
2010-09-29T01:04:42  <sigh> that will have the least impact on existing bots
2010-09-29T01:05:03  <Janzert> the problem is there are bots known to use command line arguments so they can change there behaviour when run locally
2010-09-29T01:05:06  <antimatroid> hmmm depends, mine is set up assuming we wouldn't know such information
2010-09-29T01:05:10  <Janzert> such as creating a log file and such
2010-09-29T01:05:40  <Janzert> all the starter kits that I've seen seem to handle comments correctly
2010-09-29T01:05:42  <sigh> hmm... yeah, it's a problem if they throw an error because of unknown option
2010-09-29T01:05:45  <antimatroid> from the last competition i took that it was best not to assume anything not explicitly stated for these comps
2010-09-29T01:05:55  <sigh> actually, mine will do that right now
2010-09-29T01:05:59  <sigh> ignore me, I'm stupid
2010-09-29T01:06:09  <Janzert> and comments have been in the spec from the beginning
2010-09-29T01:06:14  <antimatroid> and i really dislike being unsure about game specifics, it's alright for rules to be as general as possible, provided they are definitive from the start
2010-09-29T01:06:29  <antimatroid> but now i'm repeating myself, so i'll leave this now :)

2010-09-29T01:10:54  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: but that's not optimal if the turn limit is approaching
2010-09-29T01:11:14  <antimatroid> it is irrelevant if that's expected to keep you alive and reaching the end condition is a draw
2010-09-29T01:11:25  <antimatroid> and you wouldn't make the move ever if it wasn't expected to keep you alive
2010-09-29T01:11:28  <jmcarthur> oh, i missed the draw part
2010-09-29T01:11:39  <antimatroid> that would be assuming a much longer draw length
2010-09-29T01:11:43  <jmcarthur> but presumably it could still mean the difference between a win/lose and a draw
2010-09-29T01:11:52  <jmcarthur> which is significant
2010-09-29T01:11:55  <antimatroid> how?
2010-09-29T01:12:14  <jmcarthur> if making a move means i win whereas not making it means i draw
2010-09-29T01:12:22  <jmcarthur> the win is still more valuable
2010-09-29T01:12:37  <jmcarthur> but how do i know that it's actually beneficial?
2010-09-29T01:12:43  <antimatroid> yes, but you don't know when the turn limit is to say it will prevent you from winning, same as the other bot
2010-09-29T01:12:55  <antimatroid> and it's not going to cause you to lose
2010-09-29T01:13:02  <jmcarthur> when will i *ever* know to make such a move?
2010-09-29T01:13:07  <antimatroid> it adds more draws, but removes unecessary losses
2010-09-29T01:13:17  <jmcarthur> a draw still counts negatively against a top ranking bot
2010-09-29T01:13:35  <sigh> scenario: bot is losing, two options: 1) high risk, high reward strategy where fail is quick loss, 2) long drawn out game but sure draw
2010-09-29T01:13:36  <antimatroid> not if all top bots would have drawn in that situation
2010-09-29T01:13:55  <jmcarthur> i don't mean that particular situation is the problem
2010-09-29T01:14:03  <jmcarthur> the problem is not *knowing* whether you are in that situation
2010-09-29T01:14:09  <jmcarthur> it screws up your entire strategy
2010-09-29T01:14:09  <antimatroid> yeah, okay, it's rather retarded :)
2010-09-29T01:14:10  <sigh> fair enough
2010-09-29T01:14:47  <antimatroid> my number 1 vote would be with band of radius then, otherwise pass the number of turns in as a parameter
2010-09-29T01:15:00  <antimatroid> but an upper limit on the number of turns would be desirable
2010-09-29T01:15:07  <antimatroid> if that's going to be the case
2010-09-29T01:15:15  <jmcarthur> you mean a static number?
2010-09-29T01:15:23  <jmcarthur> like the number of turns is guaranteed to be less than x?
2010-09-29T01:15:24  <antimatroid> no, just a maximum that it can be
2010-09-29T01:15:28  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-09-29T01:15:43  <jmcarthur> i don't object to it, but i wonder about why?
2010-09-29T01:15:57  <McLeopold> I still like x turns past last neutral takeover.  Kinda like 50 moves after last capture or pawn advance in chess.
2010-09-29T01:16:05  <antimatroid> well atm i can probably change to allocating room for all future states now
2010-09-29T01:16:12  <antimatroid> whereas if that got too large, you couldn't
2010-09-29T01:16:28  <antimatroid> if it wasn't specified and you assumed you could do that, your bot might fall over in the finals, which is undesirable for those reasons
2010-09-29T01:16:29  <sigh> what is too large?
2010-09-29T01:16:30  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: heh, i would have to redesign my bot from scratch for that one :P
2010-09-29T01:16:48  <jmcarthur> eh, i guess there would still be an upper bound
2010-09-29T01:16:50  <jmcarthur> so nevermind
2010-09-29T01:17:04  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: you would just have to track the trigger that added more moves.
2010-09-29T01:17:07  <antimatroid> sigh: not sure, but there's a limit :P

2010-09-29T01:18:52  <antimatroid> would you guys hate that?
2010-09-29T01:19:03  <McLeopold> I would need more CPU time.

2010-09-29T01:20:10  <antimatroid> seriously, how are you using up memory already?
2010-09-29T01:20:14  <antimatroid> i'm using like 1.2mb
2010-09-29T01:20:43  <antimatroid> is anyone exhausting time limit yet?
2010-09-29T01:20:44  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i'm not, and probably won't be using much. i just meant that memory usage will increase more quickly than cpu usage for me
2010-09-29T01:20:56  <antimatroid> one could raise turn limit much more with like 0.5 second moves?
2010-09-29T01:21:03  <jmcarthur> although now that i think about it, they will probably increase at about the same rate
2010-09-29T01:21:20  <McLeopold> I've got a bunch of crashes on the new cloud servers.  Maybe I'm at my time limit?

2010-09-29T01:22:47  <antimatroid> hmmm, i might tell my bot to act retardedly on the main server before the comp if it ever exceeds 0.9 seconds on a move
2010-09-29T01:23:05  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I read the chapter in "Beautiful Code" about haskell.  It looks weird.

2010-09-29T01:23:29  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I couldn't get my brain around it other than it's suppose to help you write thread safe code.
2010-09-29T01:23:40  <jmcarthur> oh was it about STM or something?
2010-09-29T01:23:56  <McLeopold> I'm looking it up...
2010-09-29T01:23:57  * Janzert wishes the contest was using a dvcs, any dvcs even.
2010-09-29T01:24:13  <jmcarthur> Janzert: it's on github now, but i'm thinking maybe that was unofficial
2010-09-29T01:24:44  <Janzert> yeah, as far as I know the official development is still supposed to be through svn
2010-09-29T01:24:47  <McLeopold> Beautiful Concurrency.  He solves the Santa Claus problem.
2010-09-29T01:24:58  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: ah, i bet it was STM indeed
2010-09-29T01:25:07  <jmcarthur> that seems familiar now
2010-09-29T01:25:10  <jmcarthur> i may have read it
2010-09-29T01:25:34  <McLeopold> Yep, STM.  Gates and Groups.
2010-09-29T01:26:33  * sigh googles "Santa Claus problem"
2010-09-29T01:26:44  <jmcarthur> i like stm, but i've never really used it in any real programs. i think stm solved the problem it set out to solve, but haskell's parallelism abstractions made the need for explicit thread management a bit obsolete for many uses anyway
2010-09-29T01:26:51  <McLeopold> sigh: don't do it.  It's a trap!

2010-09-29T01:27:56  <McLeopold> It seemed more useful for big enterprise systems where you don't have one programmer.
2010-09-29T01:27:59  <jmcarthur> so while stm is a very good alternative to most locking strategies in multithreaded programs, it's not such a great alternative when the problem is for parallelism
2010-09-29T01:28:19  <sigh> hey, this problem sounds familiar :P
2010-09-29T01:28:26  <jmcarthur> i tend to just use MVars in multithreaded programs
2010-09-29T01:28:38  <McLeopold> Hmm... I should rewrite my bot in the map/reduce style...
2010-09-29T01:29:22  <jmcarthur> my bot is using a library that provides shape polymorphic, regular, multi-dimensional arrays, and if i wanted i could flip a switch and make it all run in glorious parallel
2010-09-29T01:29:30  <McLeopold> I may try haskell out some day.  Alot of euler fans use it for problems.
2010-09-29T01:29:37  <jmcarthur> but alas the rules say i may only use one OS thread
2010-09-29T01:29:45  <jmcarthur> ugh, euler is the worst, IMO
2010-09-29T01:29:54  <jmcarthur> fun little exercises, but horrible for demoing or learning a language
2010-09-29T01:29:55  <McLeopold> Really? why?
2010-09-29T01:30:21  <jmcarthur> i like euler for the thinking problems, but not for the code or coding
2010-09-29T01:30:41  <jmcarthur> and of course people tend to use it for the latter more than the former
2010-09-29T01:31:06  <sigh> i used it to learn maths

2010-09-29T02:46:20  <Janzert1> yep
2010-09-29T02:46:55  <Janzert1> you can keep uploading as many new versions as you want until the deadline
2010-09-29T02:47:07  <niknik1200> Thank you, Janzert1

2010-09-29T03:30:02  <Cyndre> antimatroid - cyndrebot only speaks when spoken to.  but silently judges you
2010-09-29T03:30:13  <Cyndre> yea that was wierd
2010-09-29T03:30:50  <Sylph> yeah sigh
2010-09-29T03:31:12  <Sylph> not sure what's up with them sending all those units  to enemy home planet
2010-09-29T03:31:20  <Sylph> not even close distance
2010-09-29T03:31:24  <Cyndre> did good defending :)
2010-09-29T03:31:26  <Sylph> it's easier to defend than to attack at that
2010-09-29T03:32:07  <sigh> don't underestimate rage tactics!
2010-09-29T03:32:18  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T03:32:22  <Sylph> yeah, but this one....
2010-09-29T03:32:45  <Cyndre> he actualy does a good job
2010-09-29T03:32:49  <Sylph> you get like 100 spare ships compared to red because red wasted so many units attacking your far away base from the begining. Your main base can just spawn units while taking 2-3 planets while waiting :/
2010-09-29T03:33:08  <Sylph> close by that would be better
2010-09-29T03:33:17  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-29T03:33:30  <Cyndre> I need more games
2010-09-29T03:33:31  <Cyndre> lol

2010-09-29T03:40:42  <Sylph> well, also that they only attack one planet at a time :/

2010-09-29T03:45:43  <mega1> I think the original server was 64bit
2010-09-29T03:45:57  <mega1> but in this modern distributed world the architectures differ
2010-09-29T03:46:06  <mega1> not sure exactly how.
2010-09-29T03:46:46  <aerique> mega1: ok, i've made an sbcl-1.0.42 package for ubuntu hardy but i only have a 32bit machine.  would you still like me to file an issue to update sbcl and point them to that package?
2010-09-29T03:48:08  <mega1> aerique: is it just 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot' to build it?
2010-09-29T03:49:26  <aerique> mega1: i did "dpkg -b dir package-name" but it probablt comes down to the same
2010-09-29T03:50:21  <mega1> I have access to x86-64 so I can build one if you supply me with the ingredients.

2010-09-29T08:23:17  <pgpaskar_> Well if you only want to compete within your groups it is possible to download the game engine and viewier and simply pit bots against eachother with that
2010-09-29T08:23:38  <pgpaskar_> The contest itself will probably play you against eachother but it will also play you against everyone else
2010-09-29T08:26:59  <mrSpec> pgpaskar_: ok, thanks. So we'll play on server, if it didnt work we'll think about download game engine. Thanks!

2010-09-29T11:45:13  <DanielVF> Janzert Doing that today, before I start on error coding
2010-09-29T11:45:29  <DanielVF> Janzert I should have done it earlier
2010-09-29T11:45:49  <Janzert> ok, thanks. Just a little worried to work on much without knowing what has changed
2010-09-29T11:46:17  <DanielVF> Yeah - sorry about holding you up. :(
2010-09-29T11:46:58  <Janzert> no problem, I can certainly understand how it goes
2010-09-29T11:48:02  <DanielVF> I've nailed down which cloud server's we'll be using
2010-09-29T11:48:11  <Janzert> great

2010-09-29T11:49:55  <Janzert> interesting, I've never done it but I've been tempted to use those for distributed testing of an arimaa playing program
2010-09-29T11:50:17  <Janzert> arimaa = chess like game but much harder for computers

2010-09-29T11:50:54  <Janzert> yeah
2010-09-29T11:51:02  <DanielVF> "spot .... yeah
2010-09-29T11:51:08  <DanielVF> For us, works great
2010-09-29T11:51:24  <Janzert> yeah, it does seem perfect for this situation
2010-09-29T11:52:11  <DanielVF> Lets us get a $120/m server for $43/m
2010-09-29T11:53:38  <Janzert> wow, that is great. I hadn't ever figured out the monthly cost difference before
2010-09-29T11:54:02  <Janzert> a little more impressive than cents per hour :)
2010-09-29T11:54:17  <DanielVF> Yeah

2010-09-29T12:14:41  <dhartmei> even if the map didn't include an enemy, and all you had to find was the orders that produced the most ships at the end of the 200th turn, that alone would be NP complete, would you agree?
2010-09-29T12:17:29  <Janzert> hmm, I'm not sure. But I don't think it would follow that a simple strategy that dominates all other strategies to eliminate the enemy is ruled out by that
2010-09-29T12:19:22  <antimatroid> gah, it's so tempting to mess around with parameters when you put together a new bot
2010-09-29T12:19:25  <Janzert> although I'm growing more reassured all the time that such a "super strategy" is going to be simple and easy to find
2010-09-29T12:19:25  <antimatroid> then it quickly turns messy

2010-09-29T13:05:03  <Zannick> i don't really know if there is anything in graph theory close enough to this
2010-09-29T13:06:50  <bhasker> question
2010-09-29T13:06:58  <bhasker> do your bots always draw against themselves
2010-09-29T13:07:20  <bhasker> logically i would expect them to given mirror matchups
2010-09-29T13:07:28  <krokokrusa> good question!
2010-09-29T13:07:40  <krokokrusa> I have no random in the bot, but it wins itself on some maps
2010-09-29T13:07:57  <edcba> it shouldn't
2010-09-29T13:07:59  <krokokrusa> the only explanation I have is that some maps are not symmetrical...
2010-09-29T13:08:09  <krokokrusa> but I'm too lazy to check it
2010-09-29T13:08:12  <bhasker> yea i can't understand it either
2010-09-29T13:08:14  <jesionaj> they are symmetrical
2010-09-29T13:08:20  <edcba> and/or a bug
2010-09-29T13:08:21  <krokokrusa> I mean since distance is calculated as an integer
2010-09-29T13:08:44  <krokokrusa> it's possible that for some pair of planets it will be +-1 compared to symmetrical pair
2010-09-29T13:08:55  <bhasker> thats possbile
2010-09-29T13:08:58  <edcba> maybe some rounding poblems
2010-09-29T13:09:03  <krokokrusa> there are n^2 pairs, so I figure there is a possibility
2010-09-29T13:09:23  <krokokrusa> maybe rounding problem
2010-09-29T13:09:30  <krokokrusa> but it exists in the engine too
2010-09-29T13:09:40  <edcba> of course
2010-09-29T13:09:55  <krokokrusa> don't you think it should be fixed if so? :)
2010-09-29T13:10:12  <krokokrusa> it's bad to have advantage for one side of the map, even such miniscule one
2010-09-29T13:10:22  <edcba> :)
2010-09-29T13:10:42  <Zannick> i think it's more likely that your bot isn't symmetrical
2010-09-29T13:10:54  <Zannick> after all, the planets aren't numbered the same on each side :)
2010-09-29T13:10:54  <krokokrusa> how it can be ?
2010-09-29T13:10:59  <bhasker> hmm why would my bot not be symmetrical if the map is?
2010-09-29T13:11:03  <krokokrusa> I ignore numbers :)
2010-09-29T13:11:08  <krokokrusa> I don't have random
2010-09-29T13:11:17  <Zannick> do you iterate through the list of planets?
2010-09-29T13:11:25  <Zannick> often they are in a certain order
2010-09-29T13:11:30  <krokokrusa> always sorted by distance or other metric
2010-09-29T13:11:38  <krokokrusa> which should be symmetrical in essense
2010-09-29T13:11:44  <bhasker> same here
2010-09-29T13:11:49  <Zannick> some planets are equidistant from other planets
2010-09-29T13:12:08  <krokokrusa> hm, good point

2010-09-29T13:37:45  <iouri_> there are assymmetries in the maps, but not the way you think.  The planet's IDs are what creates a bit of an asymmetry.  If two planets (say id=4 and id=5) are equidistant from both players, when sorting planets by distance the planet with id=4 will always appear before planet with id=5 in both players' lists
2010-09-29T13:38:21  <iouri_> but positionally, the first planet might offer advantage to first player while the second planet might offer advantage to the second player
2010-09-29T13:38:56  <iouri_> but because they're equidistant from both players and have the same # of ships and growth rates, both players will go for that planet, and the first player will end up with advantage
2010-09-29T13:39:17  <dwchandler> or not
2010-09-29T13:39:32  <iouri_> yep
2010-09-29T13:40:03  <Naktibalda_> first player is in disatvantage, because second captures cheaper
2010-09-29T13:40:06  <krokokrusa> yeah I missed the point with uncertain ordering in some cases
2010-09-29T13:40:43  <iouri_> Naktibalda_: not when the planets are equidistant
2010-09-29T13:40:55  <Naktibalda_> then they should come at the same turn
2010-09-29T13:40:58  <iouri_> yeah
2010-09-29T13:41:07  <Naktibalda_> no disatvantage for either player
2010-09-29T13:41:08  <iouri_> hm
2010-09-29T13:41:10  <iouri_> true
2010-09-29T13:41:34  <iouri_> ok, that's probably not a good example then
2010-09-29T13:41:44  <Naktibalda_> in ideal draw both players should attack central planet at the same time with same amount of ships and never capture it
2010-09-29T13:41:58  <McLeopold> iouri_: I've had bugs due to planet ordering.  I've worked through them now.
2010-09-29T13:41:58  <Zannick> ragebot is pretty symmetrical
2010-09-29T13:42:05  <Zannick> and silly to watch
2010-09-29T13:42:07  <krokokrusa> better example is when both bots have 2 equidistant (or equal by another metric) planets
2010-09-29T13:42:28  <krokokrusa> 1st bot goes for its' 1st planet, 2nd for it's second, creating assymetry
2010-09-29T13:42:35  <iouri_> ahh
2010-09-29T13:42:45  <Naktibalda_> krokokrusa: it's a simetry
2010-09-29T13:42:51  <krokokrusa> it's mirror symmetry
2010-09-29T13:42:53  <iouri_> hm.  I should probably consider that in my bot then
2010-09-29T13:42:59  <krokokrusa> but maps have central symmetry, not mirror
2010-09-29T13:43:12  <krokokrusa> hence assymetry ensues
2010-09-29T13:43:26  <hellman> the problem is that loop (pw.MyPlanets() or  pw.Planets() or etc)  goes thorigh id's
2010-09-29T13:43:34  <iouri_> yep
2010-09-29T13:44:09  <hellman> or, emulator can send mirrored coordinates to player 2 :)
2010-09-29T13:44:25  <hellman> in a way he replaces player id's
2010-09-29T13:44:27  <krokokrusa> actually, this theory can be tested :)
2010-09-29T13:44:46  <krokokrusa> you need to re-number all planets for 2nd bot, make decisions, then re-number back when issuing orders :)
2010-09-29T13:45:34  <Cyndre> or use more then 1 distance measurement
2010-09-29T13:45:52  <Cyndre> ie: first turn check the distance to target planet from your planet and your enemys planet

2010-09-29T15:01:02  <jmcarthur> man i love reducing a function from 10 lines down to just 1
2010-09-29T15:01:14  <DanielVF> jmcarthur Yup!
2010-09-29T15:01:48  <jmcarthur> the way i normally work is i bash out a solution and then clean it up before moving on, so i get to do this a lot
2010-09-29T15:02:03  <jmcarthur> but it's normally not a 90% reduction
2010-09-29T15:02:34  <antimatroid> i go to great lengths to put stuff on one line

2010-09-29T15:02:51  <jmcarthur> to be honest though this is because i removed some extra responsibility from the code and placed it on the client code
2010-09-29T15:02:51  <antimatroid> you should see my declarations and instantiations of multidimensional vectors
2010-09-29T15:03:02  <jmpespxoreax> how many lines of compiled code was that reduction? it depends on the expressiveness of the language how much goes to cycle saving. also, increased readability is its own benefit
2010-09-29T15:03:09  <jmcarthur> but i personally prefer giving responsibility to client code anyway
2010-09-29T15:03:41  <jmcarthur> jmpespxoreax: this was 10 lines of dense haskell reduced to one line of simple haskell
2010-09-29T15:03:46  <jmpespxoreax> neat
2010-09-29T15:04:39  <jmcarthur> cycle saving wasn't even a consideration in this reduction (and rarely is anyway)
2010-09-29T15:05:25  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: ha, you should see mine :P
2010-09-29T15:06:06  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: the implementation for this function is one line, but the type signatures is six lines if i remove my type synonyms

2010-09-29T15:14:33  <Migi32> (which is true, right?)
2010-09-29T15:15:13  <Naktibalda_> right
2010-09-29T15:15:16  <Migi32> these kinds of things should be in the specification
2010-09-29T15:15:19  <Naktibalda_> do you use 1 bit per planet?
2010-09-29T15:15:44  <Migi32> for some things I'll use bitfields

2010-09-29T15:22:34  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't use a 32bit bitfield for planets. i see no reason we can't have more than 32 planets
2010-09-29T15:22:56  <jmcarthur> and anyway.... what can you actually *do* with a bitfield for planets? .... i guess you can stored whether you own it or not?
2010-09-29T15:23:02  <jmcarthur> *can store

2010-09-29T15:23:11  <jmpespxoreax> from the irc logs, stating what CPU the ai-contest server has
2010-09-29T15:23:18  <Migi32> jmcarthur, another reason I use C++ over java is that I can just typedef my bitsets
2010-09-29T15:23:21  <jmpespxoreax> for Migi32, who was asking about the bit width
2010-09-29T15:23:40  <jmcarthur> Migi32: but what's the point? you can only store one bit per planet that way
2010-09-29T15:23:41  <Sylph> <Naktibalda_> javabots are using >700M :)
2010-09-29T15:23:46  <Sylph> yeah i saw that in the forum, pretty ridiculous lol
2010-09-29T15:23:52  <Zannick> jmcarthur: basically any yes or no condition about a planet
2010-09-29T15:24:04  <delt0r> Sylph: its not "real" usage however

2010-09-29T15:24:08  <Sylph> okay
2010-09-29T15:24:20  <delt0r> its addressable vers real vers shared etc
2010-09-29T15:24:22  <Migi32> jmcarthur can't go into that, it's part of the reason I will win this contest ^^
2010-09-29T15:24:34  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T15:24:36  <Sylph> good luck :p
2010-09-29T15:24:41  <Zannick> is it a 5-growth planet, is it a 4-growth planet...
2010-09-29T15:24:45  <Migi32> but to give an answer, it's to store one boolean value per planet
2010-09-29T15:24:47  <Zannick> :)
2010-09-29T15:24:56  <jmcarthur> Zannick: sure, but as soon as you have 8 of those (not unrealistic) you might as well just store a byte for each planet instead of a word for each property
2010-09-29T15:25:19  <Zannick> sure
2010-09-29T15:25:20  <jmcarthur> at least my suggestion would scale up with number of planets
2010-09-29T15:25:59  <Zannick> i'm actually only using bitfields for debug conditions, at the moment
2010-09-29T15:26:01  <jmcarthur> and i really don't think that cache coherency is an issue for these low numbers
2010-09-29T15:26:13  <Migi32> ok so it's 32-bit, making the answer to this question somewhat more important
2010-09-29T15:26:30  <Migi32> when they're doing the finals will they use the same maps?
2010-09-29T15:26:34  <jmcarthur> Migi32: personally i wouldn't assume the number of planets to be <= 32

2010-09-29T15:28:27  <jmcarthur> Migi32: does stl provide a packed bit vector or anything?
2010-09-29T15:28:37  <jmcarthur> Migi32: 200 is not specified
2010-09-29T15:28:42  <Migi32> jmcarthur, yeah it's called int

2010-09-29T15:29:08  <jmcarthur> Migi32: int has a very small limit :P
2010-09-29T15:29:21  <jmcarthur> i mean something that can actually store more than 32 or 64 bools
2010-09-29T15:29:40  <Migi32> ah yes, then it's std::bitset or something
2010-09-29T15:29:50  <Sylph> a lot of codes might choke on the competition if you suddenly increase it from 30-40 planets to 200 planets
2010-09-29T15:29:50  <Sylph> lol

2010-09-29T15:31:06  <Sylph> evening
2010-09-29T15:31:29  <jmcarthur> Migi32: the turn limit is under active debate, for the record
2010-09-29T15:32:37  <Migi32> if I were running this tournament, I'd just fix it at some value asap, because if you change it late in the tournament it's like we've been training for running a marathon by training sprinting
2010-09-29T15:32:52  <jmcarthur> Migi32: there is a patch waiting to be merged to include the turn count in the game state reported by the engine as a comment, but i don't think it's been decided whether we will even have a concrete turn limit or something more dynamic anyway...
2010-09-29T15:33:01  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i agree
2010-09-29T15:33:30  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i think including it as a comment in the game state is reasonable too though
2010-09-29T15:34:26  <Migi32> well I'm going to assume there are <= 32 planets, if they ever change it I'm out of the tournament

2010-09-29T15:38:12  <Sylph> rewriting it now to something proper
2010-09-29T15:38:21  <Migi32> I am rewriting a good framework as well
2010-09-29T15:38:23  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-29T15:38:28  <jmcarthur> i am always rewriting
2010-09-29T15:38:31  <jmcarthur> it's the haskell way
2010-09-29T15:38:33  <Sylph> I switched language a few times lol
2010-09-29T15:39:14  <Sylph> I went to java because I wasn't sure how the visualizer I had interpret the bot codes, but now I know so I went back. >.>
2010-09-29T15:39:17  <jmcarthur> i am writing way too much untested code
2010-09-29T15:39:20  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T15:39:21  <Sylph> same
2010-09-29T15:39:57  <Sylph> tempting to log everything
2010-09-29T15:40:22  * jmcarthur exponentiates everything instead

2010-09-29T15:40:45  <Migi32> I also have a problem with testing code
2010-09-29T15:41:19  <Sylph> i'm not used to unit testing :/
2010-09-29T15:41:22  <jmcarthur> i would write tests, but it's hard to come up with meaningful properties to test for a game like this
2010-09-29T15:41:29  <jmcarthur> i'm still going to try i guess
2010-09-29T15:41:31  <Sylph> like tthat'll take my coding time for something this simple that should instantly owrk >.>
2010-09-29T15:41:43  * Sylph nods at jmcarthur
2010-09-29T15:43:12  <Migi32> in theory: "I will write unit tests covering every line of code!" in practice: "Ok done. Let's see how it does. Ok, looks good, next function."
2010-09-29T15:43:17  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T15:43:26  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-29T15:43:54  <justin_pdx> My problem is that since I don't understand the game well enough, and I'm not sure what I want my bot to do, it's hard to spec out a behavior.
2010-09-29T15:43:54  <delt0r> Migi32: Then there is a bug in the test code...
2010-09-29T15:44:00  <jmcarthur> i don't care about code coverage in unit tests at all
2010-09-29T15:46:15  <boegel> any admins in here?
2010-09-29T15:46:20  <Migi32> what I also don't know yet is how to properly debug my code. I can't use gdb or valgrind because they don't work together with the PlayGame.jar
2010-09-29T15:46:30  <Sylph> do you play galcon at all, justin_pdx?
2010-09-29T15:46:40  <Sylph> you should try the flash game if you don't, that'll give you ideas.
2010-09-29T15:46:51  <justin_pdx> Sylph: I played the flash game on the website a few times.
2010-09-29T15:46:54  <Sylph> ah

2010-09-29T15:51:52  <justin_pdx> It's true.  If I was in the top ten I'd make sure people knew it by having a matching identifier.
2010-09-29T15:52:09  <Sylph> my bot will be omniscient.
2010-09-29T15:52:17  <Sylph> that's my idea for my 2nd major iteration of bot
2010-09-29T15:52:28  <justin_pdx> lol, my bot keeps saying that the only winning move is not to play.
2010-09-29T15:52:32  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T15:52:40  <Sylph> okay, yours is more omniscient than mine
2010-09-29T15:53:53  <Sylph> don't think i can beat that :D

2010-09-29T15:54:33  <Migi32> how about a game of chess?
2010-09-29T15:54:58  <Sylph> chess is so 80s, Go is the way to go :D

2010-09-29T15:55:47  <mightybyte> Go is so 3rd century BC
2010-09-29T15:55:48  <Sylph> and let them fight some premade bot

2010-09-29T15:56:23  <Migi32> oh it would be so awesome if bots could chat and flame each other

2010-09-29T15:57:01  <Sylph> make it so much more immersive

2010-09-29T16:22:39  <Zannick> they're very rare
2010-09-29T16:22:49  <boegel> ah
2010-09-29T16:22:53  <boegel> I have a question
2010-09-29T16:23:04  <Zannick> unless you play ragebot against itself or something
2010-09-29T16:23:14  <boegel> say there's a neutral planet with 4 ships
2010-09-29T16:23:30  <boegel> and both P1 and P2 send a fleet containing 5 ships, which arrive in the same turn
2010-09-29T16:23:34  <boegel> who gets the planet?
2010-09-29T16:23:46  <Naktibalda_> neutral
2010-09-29T16:23:49  <boegel> yeah
2010-09-29T16:24:00  <Migi32> with 0 ships left
2010-09-29T16:24:02  <Naktibalda_> I mean that it remains neutral
2010-09-29T16:24:04  <boegel> and what happens if the planet was owned by player 1
2010-09-29T16:24:15  <Migi32> P0 can't send fleets
2010-09-29T16:24:15  <Naktibalda_> owner doesn't change
2010-09-29T16:24:19  <Zannick> if ships become 0, control doesn't change
2010-09-29T16:24:29  <boegel> Naktibalda_: hmmk
2010-09-29T16:24:33  <boegel> I should fix that then :)
2010-09-29T16:24:46  <Zannick> the number of ships left is the largest force minus the second largest force
2010-09-29T16:24:54  <Migi32> also, if P1 and P2 attack with each 2 ships and P0 has 5 ships, not 1 but 3 ships remain
2010-09-29T16:24:58  <boegel> Zannick: owner can only change after processing all the fleets that arrive in that particular turn, right?
2010-09-29T16:25:19  <boegel> Migi32: ah, really?
2010-09-29T16:25:22  <Zannick> like i said, largest force minus second largest force
2010-09-29T16:25:38  <Zannick> where force is the sum of all ships arriving/already there
2010-09-29T16:25:48  <Zannick> s/ships/fleets/
2010-09-29T16:26:00  <boegel> Zannick: of one particular player then?
2010-09-29T16:26:10  <Zannick> of one player, yes
2010-09-29T16:26:18  <Naktibalda_> each side loose the same amount of ships
2010-09-29T16:26:52  <Zannick> only if they sent the same number of ships or one of them won
2010-09-29T16:27:14  <Zannick> P0 has 5 ships, P1 sends 3, P2 sends 2. the result is P0 with 2.

2010-09-29T16:33:22  <boegel> Naktibalda_: it's not mentioned there, hence my question
2010-09-29T16:33:54  <boegel> Naktibalda_: there are some forum posts on Scheme though, but it's unclear whether it's supported on the server
2010-09-29T16:34:06  <Naktibalda_> if it's not here, it's not supported
2010-09-29T16:34:21  <Naktibalda_> of course you can try to upload it :)

2010-09-29T16:36:25  <Naktibalda_> isn't scheme a dialect of List?

2010-09-29T16:37:15  <boegel> I think it is, yeah

2010-09-29T16:37:27  <Zannick> Bobng: mostly i think people just avoid some of the issues list or are lazy

2010-09-29T16:41:10  <Bobng> Zannick: it might need a little testing though
2010-09-29T16:41:18  <Zannick> not terribly much, and i can probably fix it up
2010-09-29T16:41:25  <Bobng> If its out of date

2010-09-29T16:41:52  <Bobng> thats the advantage of it, rather than having lots of if's and the same code
2010-09-29T16:41:56  <Zannick> yeah :)
2010-09-29T16:42:03  <Bobng> it abstracts it out. maybe a little too much abstraction, byt meh
2010-09-29T16:42:12  <Zannick> i like abstraction
2010-09-29T16:42:18  <Zannick> it occurs in a lot of my own python programming
2010-09-29T16:42:28  <Bobng> yeah, thats why I love twisted so much
2010-09-29T16:42:32  <aerique> boegel: fwiw Common Lisp is supported, but if your colleague is a rabid schemer he won't have anything to do with it :)
2010-09-29T16:42:37  <Zannick> so i'll feel right at home
2010-09-29T16:42:49  <aerique> but yeah Scheme is part of the Lisp family of languages
2010-09-29T16:42:56  <Zannick> i actually plan on abstracting the game engine sometime later
2010-09-29T16:42:58  <Bobng> Is the test machine running 64 bit or 32 bit?

2010-09-29T16:43:19  <Bobng> by that I mean does it have support for psyco or not?
2010-09-29T16:43:22  <Bobng> yeah that would be good
2010-09-29T16:43:25  <Zannick> it's 32 bit
2010-09-29T16:45:02  <boegel> aerique: I'm not sure how rabid he is, but I'll find out :)
2010-09-29T16:45:45  <aerique> boegel: he can always use a minor subset of CL and pretend it's Scheme ;-)

2010-09-29T16:59:58  <Sylph> there are so few C# programmer on the site...

2010-09-29T17:00:07  <Sylph> wonder what's up
2010-09-29T17:00:25  <u1tr0n> now im down to 402 :)
2010-09-29T17:00:25  <Sylph> like everyone use java, C++, or python
2010-09-29T17:00:42  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-29T17:00:45  <Naktibalda_> so c# is the last of 4 main languages
2010-09-29T17:00:53  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T17:00:56  <Zannick> hahaha
2010-09-29T17:01:04  <Zannick> i'm tempted to finish my bot really soon and get way up there
2010-09-29T17:01:10  <Zannick> just to add C to that list :P
2010-09-29T17:01:17  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T17:01:35  <u1tr0n> need to add brainf#ck language to list ;)
2010-09-29T17:01:39  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T17:01:41  <Sylph> or ook
2010-09-29T17:02:01  <Zannick> malbolge
2010-09-29T17:02:18  <Zannick> i practically guarantee no one will use it, though
2010-09-29T17:02:21  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T17:02:50  <Naktibalda_> u1tr0n: Gemini and NickStupich uploaded new versions soon after your game, probably they had fatal bugs
2010-09-29T17:03:29  <Sylph> yea, his games kept getting losses
2010-09-29T17:03:30  <Sylph> all 6
2010-09-29T17:03:33  <Sylph> so it's likely his fault
2010-09-29T17:03:35  <Sylph> nickstupich
2010-09-29T17:04:49  <Naktibalda_> u1tr0n: you lost a few games on second turn :)
2010-09-29T17:05:04  <u1tr0n> at nignt i made good version of bot but in morning rewrite it with bad one :( this bot didnt win any fight and im back to previos version wich work not so good but work, and now im on 402 place :D
2010-09-29T17:05:14  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T17:05:35  <Sylph> yeah i think my fixes a few days ago made my bot about as good as before the rewrite
2010-09-29T17:05:39  <Sylph> same ranks
2010-09-29T17:07:31  <Sylph> athis game is more fun than civ , lost my interest in civ >.>
2010-09-29T17:07:43  <Sylph> so may not even bother playing it, even if its just released not long ago...

2010-09-29T17:47:20  <justin_pdx> Yeah weighting potential targets is a tricky process.
2010-09-29T17:47:32  <justin_pdx> Lots of stuff you can take into account.  It's a rabbit hole for sure.
2010-09-29T17:48:48  <Naktibalda_> but you can start simple and improve it gradually
2010-09-29T17:50:07  <Naktibalda_> it's a goal of contest to find the best targets on each turn

2010-09-29T17:51:39  <u1tr0n> agree with you but i try to make first step different from others
2010-09-29T17:52:37  <Naktibalda_> what can you do differently?
2010-09-29T17:52:38  <justin_pdx> I think that would be a mistake.  There is no difference between turn one and turn two.
2010-09-29T17:52:57  <justin_pdx> In terms of the game state simply being a collection of fleets and planets and factions.
2010-09-29T17:53:00  <Naktibalda_> on turn 1 there aren't any fleets
2010-09-29T17:53:27  <Naktibalda_> I used my new formula to choose targets on the first move
2010-09-29T17:53:39  <Naktibalda_> but I used it for all turns 30 minutes later
2010-09-29T17:53:41  <justin_pdx> There is a set of fleets it's just empty.  It could easily be a state that is found later in the game.
2010-09-29T17:56:51  <jmcarthur> i said nothing special about the first turn in the spec
2010-09-29T17:57:13  <jmcarthur> because technically fleets are a part of the map format, and i see no reason why there couldn't be a map with fleets already on the move on the first turn
2010-09-29T17:58:00  <jmcarthur> a1k0n has mentioned a desire to try a map with a reinforcement fleet arriving later in the game
2010-09-29T17:58:05  <jmcarthur> as an example
2010-09-29T17:58:12  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3769), sequoh(3705), _iouri_(3669), davidjliu(3650), felixcoto(3640), Arekku(3597), sighbot(3577), kcm1700(3545), Mistmanovx(3543), Hazard(3532)
2010-09-29T18:00:24  <Sylph> yep, i don't see anything special on first turn that the bot shouldn't have considered
2010-09-29T18:00:40  <Sylph> myself
2010-09-29T18:01:39  * u1tr0n hate you all and went to delete few millions lines of first step code...

2010-09-29T18:02:18  <Sylph> lol justin
2010-09-29T18:02:26  <Zannick> i am doing special case for first turn because it is when i memoize everything that won't change
2010-09-29T18:02:40  <Zannick> and besides, i know we only have one planet each :)
2010-09-29T18:02:40  <Sylph> my bot got like no lines yet, but I added like 200+ lines already on the other files xd
2010-09-29T18:02:54  <Sylph> but i did take out 200+ overly verbose and cpu wasting lines too
2010-09-29T18:03:01  <justin_pdx> That's true, I added a bunch of methods to planets.
2010-09-29T18:03:28  <Sylph> that's the only difference really, Zannick
2010-09-29T18:03:39  <Zannick> yeah
2010-09-29T18:03:41  <Sylph> minimizing wasteful counting later down the line.
2010-09-29T18:03:54  <Zannick> oh, and no fleets
2010-09-29T18:03:56  <justin_pdx> In my model the planets talk with each other first they send out reinforcement requests, then work out what to do with the rest of their ships on their own.
2010-09-29T18:03:56  <Sylph> But you know, if your bot works for first turn, it should work for the rest anyway...
2010-09-29T18:04:04  <Sylph> so it probably isn't a big deal to recount stuff
2010-09-29T18:04:09  <Zannick> that's partially why i'm programming the first turn first
2010-09-29T18:04:13  <Zannick> i may fold that in later
2010-09-29T18:04:15  <Sylph> not good coding, but it don't matter for competition :P
2010-09-29T18:04:22  <Sylph> like this
2010-09-29T18:05:27  <Sylph> Yeah I may not do that, justin. considered that, but meh.
2010-09-29T18:05:43  <Sylph> I'm doing it through simpler method
2010-09-29T18:05:53  <Sylph> like just pulling fleets, rather than requesting them
2010-09-29T18:05:56  <justin_pdx> It prevents me also from sending too many ships, since the planet knows how many it is capable of sending, that's all encapsulated.
2010-09-29T18:06:14  <Sylph> there are many ways to do that

2010-09-29T18:11:00  <joeb_> for every configuration of planets?
2010-09-29T18:11:01  <jmcarthur> i'm actually a little skeptical, to be honest
2010-09-29T18:11:08  <Sylph> the time limit kinda limits that
2010-09-29T18:11:15  <Sylph> makes that unlikely
2010-09-29T18:11:23  <joeb_> if there's a finite number of planet arrangements why not
2010-09-29T18:11:38  <Sylph> not finite anymore once you take into account taking planets
2010-09-29T18:11:40  <jmcarthur> time limit is the only real limiter
2010-09-29T18:11:40  <Sylph> and retaking them

2010-09-29T18:11:58  <jmcarthur> Sylph: it's finite with memoization over the state of the game
2010-09-29T18:12:04  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-29T18:12:17  <jmcarthur> actually, maybe not
2010-09-29T18:12:24  <jmcarthur> since fleets can grow without bound
2010-09-29T18:12:30  <jmcarthur> *ship count
2010-09-29T18:12:31  <Sylph> well, bounded by 200 turns
2010-09-29T18:12:35  <jmcarthur> ah right
2010-09-29T18:12:36  <jmcarthur> nevermind then
2010-09-29T18:12:44  <Sylph> still going to get crazy though
2010-09-29T18:12:46  <jmcarthur> (although technically 200 isn't set in stone)
2010-09-29T18:12:54  <Sylph> true
2010-09-29T18:13:04  <Sylph> but just alter the number :D
2010-09-29T18:13:07  <Sylph> if they change it
2010-09-29T18:13:07  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T18:13:16  <Zannick> the number of possible orders at each time step is finite
2010-09-29T18:13:22  <Sylph> and if you can project 200 turns into the future, that's a lot still.
2010-09-29T18:13:29  <justin_pdx> I think it is solvable for example in the simplest case, two starting planets and no neutral planets, you can solve that one pretty quick.
2010-09-29T18:13:35  <Zannick> but then again, so are chess moves
2010-09-29T18:13:41  <jmcarthur> well, i'm already projecting the entire game, just not every possible game
2010-09-29T18:13:52  <a1k0n> justin_pdx: actually i tried that.  couldn't solve it for more than 8 moves out, maybe 12 if i let my computer run for a long time
2010-09-29T18:13:55  <Sylph> in that case don't send any unit, justin_pdx :/
2010-09-29T18:14:04  <a1k0n> branching factor is way too huge
2010-09-29T18:14:12  <Sylph> yeah a1kon
2010-09-29T18:14:13  <justin_pdx> Exactly.  Now do the experiment with one neutral planet.

2010-09-29T18:14:27  <a1k0n> er, i did it with one neutral planet.
2010-09-29T18:14:34  <a1k0n> two starting planets, well, there's not much of a game there
2010-09-29T18:14:53  <jmcarthur> but it's still a good test of feasibility of traversing an entire game tree
2010-09-29T18:15:00  <jmcarthur> if you can't do it for just two planets...
2010-09-29T18:15:18  <jmcarthur> branching factor increases by growth rates every turn
2010-09-29T18:15:24  <a1k0n> i'm sure that a few simplifications can be made rather than testing every single combination of ships though.
2010-09-29T18:15:27  <jmcarthur> well
2010-09-29T18:15:31  <jmcarthur> not quite what i just said
2010-09-29T18:15:36  <jmcarthur> definitely
2010-09-29T18:15:44  <jmcarthur> linear programming is still deceptively tempting
2010-09-29T18:15:49  <justin_pdx> I think the ideal strategy for the game can be determined by analyzing a system of two starting planets and one neutral planet.  All rules and strategies should be applicable in that system.
2010-09-29T18:15:50  <a1k0n> but i wasn't 100% certain, so i tried it
2010-09-29T18:15:53  <jmcarthur> but i don't think that would be possible
2010-09-29T18:16:04  <McLeopold> I suspect every symmetrical map is a draw, with perfect play.
2010-09-29T18:16:17  <a1k0n> it turns out to be very... game-theoretic.  predicting your opponent's move is probably key more than anything.
2010-09-29T18:16:20  <justin_pdx> McLeopold: I think so too.
2010-09-29T18:16:21  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: maybe a draw over an infinite number of games
2010-09-29T18:16:33  <jmcarthur> i don't think perfect play is deterministic though
2010-09-29T18:16:40  <jmcarthur> therefore, it won't be a draw every time
2010-09-29T18:16:45  <a1k0n> right, it is not
2010-09-29T18:17:01  <McLeopold> If each bot took turns moving, then it would be.
2010-09-29T18:17:12  <a1k0n> i've demonstrated to my own satisfaction that it requires making an assumption about your opponent's move before you see it, so there are mutual exclusion events
2010-09-29T18:17:15  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: right
2010-09-29T18:17:16  <justin_pdx> What do you mean by "perfect play is deterministic" jmcarthur?
2010-09-29T18:17:20  <a1k0n> but yes, if they took turns, then player 1 loses
2010-09-29T18:17:22  <Sylph> it'll be deterministic if the assumptions, etc are the same :/
2010-09-29T18:17:27  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: i think perfect play is a mixed strategy
2010-09-29T18:17:30  <Sylph> so it'll be draw
2010-09-29T18:17:47  <Sylph> since the maps are symmetric xd
2010-09-29T18:17:52  <jmcarthur> Sylph: nope. perfect play is often going to be a mixed strategy, i suspect
2010-09-29T18:17:52  <McLeopold> a1k0n: not so in checkers
2010-09-29T18:18:06  <Sylph> there's no 'perfect play' in that case xd
2010-09-29T18:18:10  <Sylph> perfect in the first place is deterministic
2010-09-29T18:18:16  <a1k0n> right, well, i meant in galcon with "simultaneous turns" but with player 1's moves revealed to player 2
2010-09-29T18:18:17  <jmcarthur> Sylph: not true
2010-09-29T18:18:27  <Sylph> really good play
2010-09-29T18:18:29  <jmcarthur> Sylph: by that criteria there is no perfect play
2010-09-29T18:18:29  <justin_pdx> I think the game requires absolutely zero assumptions about your opponents likely moves.
2010-09-29T18:18:35  <Sylph> is not the same as perfect where there's no more improvement to be made
2010-09-29T18:18:39  <Sylph> ever
2010-09-29T18:18:44  <McLeopold> "Perfect play" in r/p/s should result in 33% win/loss/draw ratio.
2010-09-29T18:18:50  <McLeopold> I think planet wars in the same.
2010-09-29T18:18:50  <Zannick> a1k0n: i think of it in terms of alpha-beta, where you consider what your opponent can do *now*
2010-09-29T18:19:17  <a1k0n> yes but you have to marginalize over your opponent's possible moves
2010-09-29T18:19:26  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: repeated games of rps can have one opponent trying to guess the other opponent's PRNG of course ;)
2010-09-29T18:19:36  <McLeopold> Check out my strategy post on close positions.  There is some "more perfect play" than others.
2010-09-29T18:19:36  <Zannick> so you end up maximizing your value over that
2010-09-29T18:19:55  <a1k0n> well, definitely
2010-09-29T18:20:10  <McLeopold> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=819
2010-09-29T18:20:14  <jmcarthur> my bot is taking a very game theoretic approach to this, but i don't know how well it will work in practice
2010-09-29T18:21:24  <jmcarthur> Sylph: if one accepts a mixed strategy as a strategy rather than a single game played according to that strategy, then the mixed strategy can be "perfect"
2010-09-29T18:21:37  <Sylph> as long as you keep the 'quote' in there :D
2010-09-29T18:21:55  <jmcarthur> Sylph: where "perfect" just means that there is no other strategy you would want to use
2010-09-29T18:22:08  <Sylph> chess games have perfect moves, with every turn calculated to the end. xd
2010-09-29T18:22:18  <Sylph> forgot when they managed that
2010-09-29T18:22:18  <jmcarthur> Sylph: but that perfection also relies on your opponent being perfect

2010-09-29T18:22:45  <jmcarthur> Sylph: a different strategy could be better than a "perfect" strategy if you know an imperfection in your opponent
2010-09-29T18:22:46  <Sylph> that's 'perfect' xd
2010-09-29T18:22:54  <Sylph> then its not perfect. :/
2010-09-29T18:22:58  <Sylph> if it got 'imperfection'
2010-09-29T18:23:01  <Sylph> wth >.<
2010-09-29T18:23:05  <Sylph> you're confusing me
2010-09-29T18:23:23  <jmcarthur> perfection just has to be defined, is all i'm saying
2010-09-29T18:23:39  <justin_pdx> Perfection is "not beatable".
2010-09-29T18:23:49  <justin_pdx> You can draw against it, but that's it.
2010-09-29T18:23:49  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: not the case, IMO
2010-09-29T18:23:56  <McLeopold> The prisoner's dilemma is an example of a game with "more perfect" strategies with both players making moves at the same time.  But winning is more of a meta game.
2010-09-29T18:24:03  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: even a perfect bot can be beaten in rock paper scissors
2010-09-29T18:24:14  <jmcarthur> in a particular instance of the game
2010-09-29T18:24:23  <justin_pdx> Space Wars is not rock paper scissors.
2010-09-29T18:24:25  <McLeopold> You strategy has to beat the majority of other strategies in play.
2010-09-29T18:24:28  <Zannick> we should have a contest where we make bots to play the meta game
2010-09-29T18:24:32  <Sylph> rock paper scissor is all about luck. :|
2010-09-29T18:24:42  <Sylph> how can you do a 'perfect' bot on it >.>
2010-09-29T18:24:43  <Zannick> they go into an irc channel to discuss the bots they're writing for the game
2010-09-29T18:24:58  <Itkovian> I understand with perfect move we mean the move that leads to a win when simulated all possible following moves by the player and the oponnent to the end of the game
2010-09-29T18:24:59  <jmcarthur> Sylph: an imperfect bot would be easily predictable :P
2010-09-29T18:24:59  <Sylph> luck and subjective analysis of opponent moves
2010-09-29T18:25:07  <Sylph> or a bad bot
2010-09-29T18:25:15  <Sylph> don't need to throw out words like 'perfect' in a game of chance. xd
2010-09-29T18:25:22  <Sylph> better vs worse is good enough
2010-09-29T18:25:24  <jmcarthur> Itkovian: i don't believe that such a move necessarily exist in planet wars
2010-09-29T18:25:28  <justin_pdx> Space Wars is not a game of chance.
2010-09-29T18:25:28  <jmcarthur> *exists
2010-09-29T18:25:43  <Sylph> it exist, planet wars isn't about chance
2010-09-29T18:25:50  <Sylph> whether it can be calculated quickly is a different matter
2010-09-29T18:25:54  <Itkovian> jmcarthur: that would be my guess too, but having proof would be nice
2010-09-29T18:25:54  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: i disagree
2010-09-29T18:26:01  <a1k0n> but it's a prisoner's dilemma kind of thing
2010-09-29T18:26:05  <justin_pdx> For example, tic tac toe is solveable.  It is possible to never lose.
2010-09-29T18:26:22  <Sylph> Though I might be wrong
2010-09-29T18:26:23  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: it's a deterministic engine, but when there are two equally valuable moves to make that you must choose between, that introduces nondeterminism
2010-09-29T18:26:37  <Zannick> tic tac toe is solvable because the game space is very small
2010-09-29T18:26:43  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: true, but planet wars is simultaneous play
2010-09-29T18:26:49  <Zannick> checkers is solved because the game space is relatively small
2010-09-29T18:26:57  <Itkovian> Zannick: for a perfect move you;d assume the resources to be unlimited, of course.
2010-09-29T18:27:00  <a1k0n> say you have a map with two starting planets and one central neutral planet.  you can attempt to take the neutral if your opponent sends his ships to you then you lose.  you can send your ships to your opponent but he might send them to you (nash equilibrium)
2010-09-29T18:27:05  <Sylph> thanks to the game being symmetrical, that don't really matter, jmcarthur.
2010-09-29T18:27:12  <jmcarthur> Sylph: yes it does
2010-09-29T18:27:16  <Itkovian> The fact that it exists does not mean you can compute it any time soon
2010-09-29T18:27:18  <justin_pdx> I think that space wars has equilibrium.
2010-09-29T18:27:27  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: over an infinite number of games, i agree
2010-09-29T18:27:28  <Sylph> I suppose the enemy could send to teh same planet or the other planet
2010-09-29T18:27:31  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: over a single game, no
2010-09-29T18:28:24  <a1k0n> it's easy to construct prisoners' dilemma situations in planet wars, really
2010-09-29T18:28:25  <jmcarthur> Sylph: consider a map with two home planets and two neutrals, both neutrals being equal distances from both home planets. it's symmetrical, but the game will be necessarily nondeterministic between two perfect players
2010-09-29T18:28:36  <McLeopold> a1kon: that 2 planet scenario is solvable.  but the solution only garrentees a draw.
2010-09-29T18:28:38  <Sylph> not necessarily hrm
2010-09-29T18:28:43  <Sylph> just turns into a draw
2010-09-29T18:28:45  <jmcarthur> nope
2010-09-29T18:28:49  <Sylph> whether they take one planet each
2010-09-29T18:28:51  <Sylph> or attack same planet
2010-09-29T18:28:52  <a1k0n> McLeopold: right, but there are two equilibria
2010-09-29T18:28:52  <Sylph> it's same thing
2010-09-29T18:28:56  <Sylph> they stay at the same
2010-09-29T18:28:58  <a1k0n> depending on the size of the neutral planet anyway

2010-09-29T18:29:20  <a1k0n> generally any solvable symmetric scenario guarantees a draw :)
2010-09-29T18:29:21  <Sylph> but the moves with least chance to lose
2010-09-29T18:29:21  <jmcarthur> or defend
2010-09-29T18:29:54  <McLeopold> a1kon: as long as the neutral force to takeover is more than the growth rate, it's a draw
2010-09-29T18:29:55  <jmcarthur> Sylph: i don't believe such single moves (pure strategies) necessarily exist
2010-09-29T18:29:59  * Sylph nods
2010-09-29T18:30:12  <jmcarthur> Sylph: i don't believe that planet wars will always have a pure, dominant strategy, is what i mean
2010-09-29T18:30:13  <Sylph> it may not, i think it might exist.
2010-09-29T18:30:18  * Sylph nods
2010-09-29T18:30:23  <a1k0n> McLeopold: it's a draw even if not, because both players can choose to send all their ships to the neutral on the first turn
2010-09-29T18:30:51  <jmcarthur> anyway time to make dinner
2010-09-29T18:31:02  <McLeopold> a1kon: then if the second player waits 1 turn, they steal the planet.
2010-09-29T18:31:21  <Sylph> yup
2010-09-29T18:31:54  <Zannick> McLeopold: right, but then why wouldn't the first player wait a turn, too?
2010-09-29T18:31:57  <a1k0n> hmm, true.  yeah i guess the only stable point is attacking directly
2010-09-29T18:32:06  <a1k0n> ...or sitting there indefinitely
2010-09-29T18:32:08  <McLeopold> Zannick: they would, thus perfect play is a draw
2010-09-29T18:32:33  <Zannick> even attacking directly isn't guaranteed to work, thanks to growth rates and distance
2010-09-29T18:32:39  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-29T18:32:55  <McLeopold> Seriously, look at all my games on map 30.
2010-09-29T18:32:56  <Sylph> well, if you calculate the growth rate and distance
2010-09-29T18:33:04  <Sylph> and the size of the neutral planets
2010-09-29T18:33:13  <Sylph> you can decide whether attacking directly is good or not, at least
2010-09-29T18:33:18  <justin_pdx> In a one-neutral-planet system the neutral planet is a poison pill, assuming it's inhabited.  If it has zero population, then both players should instantly attack it.
2010-09-29T18:33:27  <Sylph> see how many units the enemy will get extra due to your attacking directly xd
2010-09-29T18:33:31  <a1k0n> yeah, so there has to be neutrals closer to you than to your opponent for any sort of attack to make sense
2010-09-29T18:33:34  <Sylph> you can still make it neutral :D
2010-09-29T18:33:38  <Sylph> a draw
2010-09-29T18:33:40  <Sylph> mm
2010-09-29T18:33:50  <Sylph> but a perfect game would mean both bots do the same thing :/
2010-09-29T18:33:58  <McLeopold> justin_pdx: yes, neutral force must be greater than growth rate for draw condition
2010-09-29T18:34:14  <justin_pdx> They wouldn't have to do the same thing, Sylph.
2010-09-29T18:34:39  <Sylph> maybe
2010-09-29T18:34:40  <Sylph> hrm
2010-09-29T18:34:44  <justin_pdx> For example, a bot in that situation that did nothing but ragebot would still draw.

2010-09-29T18:35:11  <McLeopold> You can easily create these test maps.
2010-09-29T18:35:24  <Sylph> yeah, but not the 200 turns projection :p

2010-09-29T18:36:51  <Zannick> custom maps like that are a good way to test edge cases
2010-09-29T18:37:01  <Zannick> yeah
2010-09-29T18:37:07  <a1k0n> haha albert's visualizer is hilarious on that map
2010-09-29T18:37:10  <justin_pdx> What language do you work with, McLeopold
2010-09-29T18:37:16  <McLeopold> python
2010-09-29T18:37:43  <a1k0n> a1k0n-0.4.1 beats ragebot on that map after 7 planet captures
2010-09-29T18:37:44  <McLeopold> my data structures change around so much, it's a good thing it's typeless
2010-09-29T18:38:54  <Sylph> I lose to ragebot
2010-09-29T18:38:56  <Sylph> :|
2010-09-29T18:38:59  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T18:39:04  <McLeopold> I'm planning to rewrite in javascript. :)
2010-09-29T18:39:04  <Sylph> my old bot anyway
2010-09-29T18:39:22  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-29T18:39:24  <Sylph> crazy
2010-09-29T18:39:30  <Sylph> just kidding
2010-09-29T18:39:36  <Sylph> at least its not ook
2010-09-29T18:40:20  <McLeopold> I takes me 31 turns with my current bot.
2010-09-29T18:40:35  <Sylph> I only have the bot I wrote on the day I joined with fixes the day after :/
2010-09-29T18:40:45  <McLeopold> (I might write a bot in whitespace)
2010-09-29T18:40:53  <Sylph> well, working on one from scratch atm
2010-09-29T18:40:56  <Sylph> still working on frameworks :|
2010-09-29T18:40:58  <Sylph> before the bot itself
2010-09-29T18:41:16  <Itkovian> Do you have an URL for that visualiser?
2010-09-29T18:41:44  <a1k0n> so anyway that map is a perfect example.  the equilibrium strategy is a draw, and ragebot uses that strategy, but if you have a predictive model of ragebot's moves you can win
2010-09-29T18:42:00  <a1k0n> or rather ragebot doesn't use that strategy
2010-09-29T18:42:06  <McLeopold> a1k0n: I don't predict anything. ;)
2010-09-29T18:42:24  <a1k0n> i don't either.  i guess you just have to be able to exploit a situation.
2010-09-29T18:42:43  <McLeopold> ...and have good defence.
2010-09-29T18:43:14  <McLeopold> a1k0n: this contest was more fun when you were the top bot.
2010-09-29T18:43:23  <a1k0n> so a "perfect" bot would have to wait for its opponent to do something on that map.
2010-09-29T18:43:28  <a1k0n> heh.  yeah, i agree!
2010-09-29T18:43:53  <Sylph> yea
2010-09-29T18:43:55  <McLeopold> Nope: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=819
2010-09-29T18:44:05  <Sylph> the opponent would waste their units on something and you can steal it
2010-09-29T18:44:13  <a1k0n> no, i mean, on the 3-planet map example
2010-09-29T18:44:16  <Sylph> yup
2010-09-29T18:44:16  <Sylph> i know
2010-09-29T18:44:20  <McLeopold> still no
2010-09-29T18:44:25  <a1k0n> obviously on maps where there are neutrals closer to you than to your enemy then there's a better way to do it
2010-09-29T18:44:32  * Sylph nods
2010-09-29T18:44:42  <McLeopold> That's my second map!
2010-09-29T18:44:49  <a1k0n> McLeopold: what does your bot do on turn 1 on the 3-planet map?
2010-09-29T18:45:11  <McLeopold> P 5 5 0 29 4
2010-09-29T18:45:11  <McLeopold> P 0 5 1 100 5
2010-09-29T18:45:11  <McLeopold> P 11 5 2 100 5
2010-09-29T18:45:17  <Sylph> many of your opponents are wasteful there, McLeopold
2010-09-29T18:45:32  <Sylph> dumping all their units unnecessarily on their main planet
2010-09-29T18:45:44  <Sylph> much more than they need
2010-09-29T18:45:58  <Sylph> hrm, or attacking you directly >.>
2010-09-29T18:46:05  <a1k0n> (i mean the symmetric 3 planet map)
2010-09-29T18:46:10  * Sylph nods
2010-09-29T18:46:38  <McLeopold> 51 to the center

2010-09-29T18:47:25  <a1k0n> in that case why can't an opponent send 50+5*diameter+1 to you and diameter/2*5+1 to the center on turn 2?
2010-09-29T18:47:56  <a1k0n> then you have to abandon your planet and take theirs
2010-09-29T18:48:06  <McLeopold> because that's too many ships?
2010-09-29T18:48:44  <a1k0n> depends on how far away they are i guess
2010-09-29T18:48:47  <McLeopold> what's diameter?  on the small map it is 10?
2010-09-29T18:48:58  <a1k0n> on your map it is.  i was using a diameter of like 4
2010-09-29T18:49:20  <McLeopold> so both planets are 4 from the neutral?
2010-09-29T18:49:28  <a1k0n> 2 from the neutral.
2010-09-29T18:49:34  <McLeopold> hold on...
2010-09-29T18:50:22  <McLeopold> 20 to the enemy planet, I draw against Ragebot
2010-09-29T18:50:50  <McLeopold> given that the neutral is 29
2010-09-29T18:51:00  <McLeopold> If it was less than 20, I might do something different

2010-09-29T18:51:46  <Zannick> how do you draw if you lose 20 ships first?
2010-09-29T18:51:51  <Zannick> oh wait, nvm
2010-09-29T18:52:02  <a1k0n> he loses them too
2010-09-29T18:52:04  <Zannick> misread enemy as neutral
2010-09-29T18:52:09  <Zannick> -_-
2010-09-29T18:52:10  <McLeopold> Attacking the enemy doesn't lose you ships.  Ever.
2010-09-29T18:52:16  <McLeopold> oh
2010-09-29T18:52:47  <a1k0n> it does if your metric is your ships/total ships and you're behind in ships
2010-09-29T18:52:59  <a1k0n> if your metric is yours-his, then no
2010-09-29T18:53:20  <McLeopold> a1k0n: oh... I better code that in.
2010-09-29T18:53:24  <a1k0n> haha.
2010-09-29T18:53:34  <justin_pdx> Nice observation, a1k0n.
2010-09-29T18:53:48  <Zannick> haha
2010-09-29T18:53:56  <a1k0n> that is why my bot, when ahead, will draw the enemy down with a stream of attacks
2010-09-29T18:54:03  <a1k0n> prevents neutral takeovers, etc.
2010-09-29T18:54:19  <McLeopold> Mine does that too, but I never thought to not do that when I'm behind.
2010-09-29T18:54:29  <McLeopold> This changes everything!
2010-09-29T18:54:33  <a1k0n> yw
2010-09-29T18:54:45  <justin_pdx> I've seen some of the advanced bots have that kind of "I'm ahead, stall 'em" mode.  It's interesting to watch them swicth from a growth/defend strategy to an attrition strategy.
2010-09-29T18:54:50  <a1k0n> so far each improvement like that has brought me a weaker bot
2010-09-29T18:55:30  <McLeopold> maybe you need to fight for a few extra turns before you turn off the hose?
2010-09-29T18:55:30  <Zannick> "improvement"
2010-09-29T18:55:56  <a1k0n> let's call it a nonimproving innovation.  i have many of those.
2010-09-29T18:56:15  <McLeopold> If you watch my official games, it appears my bot does that switch.
2010-09-29T18:56:17  <a1k0n> i've basically been cranking up the accuracy with which i forecast a completely fictional future.
2010-09-29T18:56:22  <Zannick> i may have had some of those
2010-09-29T18:56:24  <McLeopold> It's actually just gone catatonic.
2010-09-29T18:56:55  <McLeopold> It's a bug.

2010-09-29T18:59:39  <Itkovian> I think a good strategy when ahead is wear down the enemy by attacking each planet with its growth and save the rest to take over neutrals
2010-09-29T18:59:47  <Itkovian> I still have to implement it though
2010-09-29T18:59:55  <Itkovian> and get ahead to actually test it :-)
2010-09-29T19:00:25  <Naktibalda_> it'sa better strategy to capture enemy planets
2010-09-29T19:00:33  <Itkovian> McLeopold: When behind, you need to be aggressive but also save enough ships to take over planets with a single or a few fleets

2010-09-29T19:00:45  <Itkovian> Naktibalda: the win is determined by the number of ships
2010-09-29T19:01:18  <Itkovian> well, yes, but if there are neutrals that are easily taken ...
2010-09-29T19:01:24  <Naktibalda_> capturing enemy planet doesn't change difference in number of ships
2010-09-29T19:01:31  <Naktibalda_> neutrals make it worse
2010-09-29T19:01:45  <Itkovian> the point is you need to save the extra ships to take a planet, not to steadily wear down the enemy
2010-09-29T19:01:53  <McLeopold> Itkovain: I'm implementing that next.
2010-09-29T19:01:54  <Itkovian> I think.
2010-09-29T19:02:15  <McLeopold> I call it my "anti-dmj" code.

2010-09-29T19:30:50  <bhasker> i am slowly climbing towards the top 100 ... but taking its own sweet time
2010-09-29T19:31:09  <bhasker> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=5822
2010-09-29T19:31:50  <bhasker> sigh i have a question, do you implement look ahead and if so how, one thing i have been considering is my heuristic based approach works fine in some, but in some the bot just gets stupid and selects the wrong starting
2010-09-29T19:31:51  <bhasker> planets
2010-09-29T19:31:58  <bhasker> and then its just downhill from there
2010-09-29T19:32:20  <bhasker> so either a) i need to come up with different heuristics for different variations of the maps or implement some sort of lookahead
2010-09-29T19:32:35  <sigh> well, my bots knows the future states of the planets based on current ships, but that's about it
2010-09-29T19:32:43  <bhasker> yea that my bot does too
2010-09-29T19:32:47  <sigh> it doesn't do any searching of the game tree
2010-09-29T19:33:00  <bhasker> neither does mine but i am wondering if its good to do it at start
2010-09-29T19:33:04  <bhasker> like in the first move
2010-09-29T19:33:11  <bhasker> identify all available planets
2010-09-29T19:33:24  <bhasker> and look ahead 5-6 turns and see which maximizes your ships
2010-09-29T19:33:52  <sigh> I just haven't figured out a good way to do it
2010-09-29T19:34:11  <bhasker> hmm
2010-09-29T19:35:43  <sigh> there's a lot of stuff I keep trying and failing, and a lot of other stuff I want to do, but don't know how yet
2010-09-29T19:36:51  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-29T19:38:06  <bhasker> i think my current heuristic is a bit better than before
2010-09-29T19:38:07  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=229848
2010-09-29T19:38:18  <bhasker> but it still gets kinda stupid in maps when starting positions are close by

2010-09-29T19:59:47  <Janzert> I know some that were timing out found it to be a problem in the bot, but I don't think server problems have been ruled out for sure as well
2010-09-29T20:01:27  <Zannick> there's often a reason for it, like a noncompiled program being unable to run due to incompatibility
2010-09-29T20:04:08  <FlagCapper> Well my program runs perfectly fine on my computer, and 1/5th of the games on the server
2010-09-29T20:04:23  <FlagCapper> Sorry, 4/5ths
2010-09-29T20:04:31  <FlagCapper> It timeouts randomly occasionally

2010-09-29T20:05:51  <Zannick> probably a freak error, then.
2010-09-29T20:06:18  <FlagCapper> On my part or thiers?
2010-09-29T20:06:48  <Zannick> either, i don't know
2010-09-29T20:07:03  <FlagCapper> Ok, thanks
2010-09-29T20:07:14  <davidjliu> when my bot times out, it usually does it two games in a row or something
2010-09-29T20:07:48  <FlagCapper> The oddest part is I have my bot set to quit at 1/40th of a second
2010-09-29T20:07:54  <FlagCapper> I can't possibly see how it would timeout
2010-09-29T20:07:55  <Zannick> when we get error indications, we might be able to narrow it down further
2010-09-29T20:08:20  <Zannick> if it's a server issue, then it's either not letting you run, or not reading "go" correctly
2010-09-29T20:10:03  <Zannick> i was actually testing a bug report yesterday and i found that i needed to flush the output stream in order to not timeout from python on the first turn
2010-09-29T20:14:54  <FlagCapper> I'm using C++, so I don't know if that matters
2010-09-29T20:15:10  <Janzert> you should still flush stdout at the end of your turn
2010-09-29T20:15:39  <Janzert> I thought the starter bot already did if you're building off that but I may be remembering wrong
2010-09-29T20:15:49  <FlagCapper> It does
2010-09-29T20:16:08  <Zannick> the starterbot flushes after each order
2010-09-29T20:16:16  <Zannick> and the "go"
2010-09-29T20:16:21  <Janzert> doesn't hurt :)
2010-09-29T20:16:58  <Janzert> well technically I suppose it could take a little bit of unnecessary time

2010-09-29T20:34:40  <Sylph> I want to submit new bot to test out if my C# code will compile on the server... but don't want to lose all my previous fights:/

2010-09-29T20:35:04  <amstan> Sylph: so... keep the version that you have on the server
2010-09-29T20:35:06  <amstan> upload thins one
2010-09-29T20:35:11  <amstan> then upload the other one back
2010-09-29T20:35:15  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-29T20:35:21  <Sylph> but lose all the current fights
2010-09-29T20:35:28  <Sylph> can't watch them anymore coz they get removed from my page xd
2010-09-29T20:36:13  <sigh> yeah, I find that annoying too... it would be nice to have a compile test

2010-09-29T20:37:14  <Sylph> i guess I can like 'save the page

2010-09-29T21:08:34  <DanielVF> Yeah, if you don't do this, your bot won't play
2010-09-29T21:09:04  <DanielVF> C standard lib, and most standard IO libs buffer output on the bot side
2010-09-29T21:09:16  <DanielVF> until you've generated 4K of output
2010-09-29T21:09:42  <DanielVF> So flush on go, or die.

2010-09-29T21:17:08  <DanielVF> Like that

2010-09-29T21:17:15  <FlagCapper> Ok
2010-09-29T21:18:16  <DanielVF> It's possible that later on we could do something like timeout or crash X games in a row, and stop playing that submission
2010-09-29T21:20:14  <sigh> maybe for first move crash/timeout for really broken bots, but otherwise it should just be a loss I suggest

2010-09-29T21:20:57  <DanielVF> Gonna try to make a distintion between first move timeouts and later ones
