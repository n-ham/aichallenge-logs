2011-11-30T00:23:43  <antimatroid> sweet
2011-11-30T00:23:55  <antimatroid> janzert: what are you up to these days? you're very quiet :P
2011-11-30T00:24:33  <antimatroid> wow, over 7000 submissions
2011-11-30T00:24:56  <janzert> ? just fixing the breaks and keeping it all running along :)
2011-11-30T00:25:42  <antimatroid> i meant other than the ai contest :P you used to be involved in strategy conversations more
2011-11-30T00:25:54  <antimatroid> or maybe i'm just involved less (been busier than previously)
2011-11-30T00:27:16  <janzert> ahh, yeah I haven't been talking strategy much
2011-11-30T00:27:34  <janzert> the guts of the contest have been keeping me occupied enough
2011-11-30T00:30:43  <cuademon> Oh, heh, ChrisH kept an ant on top of his hill
2011-11-30T00:31:59  <McLeopold> I'm only going to be able to write a post-mortem about map gen :(
2011-11-30T00:32:27  <cuademon> Looks like he has time issues
2011-11-30T00:33:12  <janzert> McLeopold: :) coming slowly I take it?
2011-11-30T00:34:32  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm cleaning up my crappy cell maze code so I can do the inverse
2011-11-30T00:34:37  <McLeopold> which I will call "caverns"
2011-11-30T00:35:00  <janzert> cool
2011-11-30T00:35:17  <McLeopold> maybe tonight I'll get some maps on paste...
2011-11-30T00:35:21  <thestinger> McLeopold: awesome
2011-11-30T00:35:23  <thestinger> I love the cell mazes
2011-11-30T00:35:34  <thestinger> the regular mazes lead to stalemates too easily
2011-11-30T00:35:45  <McLeopold> is there really a big difference?
2011-11-30T00:36:05  <thestinger> yeah, because the cell mazes usually have a wider end to the chokepoints
2011-11-30T00:36:23  <thestinger> the regular boxy mazes end up having stalemates in 4x4 pathways etc.
2011-11-30T00:36:37  <McLeopold> so, the choke points are longer
2011-11-30T00:37:26  <thestinger> yeah, and usually you can put more ants along one side than the other because of the curves
2011-11-30T00:38:00  <McLeopold> I think that was the intention of the decayed walls in antimatroid's design
2011-11-30T00:38:07  <thestinger> the fact that they're really long means you can actually trade ants with someone without the ratio being really uneven
2011-11-30T00:38:35  <thestinger> like the 1x1 chokepoints in some of the random walks :P
2011-11-30T00:38:51  <thestinger> well
2011-11-30T00:38:58  <thestinger> the 1 wide or 2 wide tunnels
2011-11-30T00:39:00  <antimatroid> yeah my maze maps suck compared to the newer ones
2011-11-30T00:39:37  <antimatroid> what type of symmetry do people like most?
2011-11-30T00:39:48  <janzert> the stats don't seem to be about even for stalemates between the two map types
2011-11-30T00:39:56  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I think you have more symmetry types than me
2011-11-30T00:39:56  <antimatroid> the translational/tessellation ones or the rotational ones?
2011-11-30T00:40:02  <McLeopold> I didn't do any diagonals, yet...
2011-11-30T00:40:21  <janzert> do seem to be about even rather
2011-11-30T00:40:39  <McLeopold> janzert: how about just for thestinger? :)
2011-11-30T00:40:40  <antimatroid> McLeopold: for "rigid rotations" of the board, there's 5 types of 2 player, 3 types of 4 player and 1 type of 8 player
2011-11-30T00:40:59  <McLeopold> rigid?
2011-11-30T00:41:13  <antimatroid> pick the grid up, flip/rotate it and put it back down
2011-11-30T00:41:28  <antimatroid> that's a "rigid rotation" in this case :P
2011-11-30T00:42:03  <McLeopold> rotate 90 or 270?
2011-11-30T00:42:21  <antimatroid> depends on the situation
2011-11-30T00:42:38  <McLeopold> diagonal is different
2011-11-30T00:42:52  <antimatroid> you have vertical/horizontal/diaonal "flips", and n.90 degree rotations
2011-11-30T00:43:11  <McLeopold> diagonal only works with squares
2011-11-30T00:43:23  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-30T00:43:38  <McLeopold> seems like it might be a give away in the map size :)
2011-11-30T00:44:32  <antimatroid> a valid symmetry is basically just one of those rigid rotations such that after n repeated rotations the grid ends up being back to the same place
2011-11-30T00:44:51  <antimatroid> that's why i call all of those rotational symmetry
2011-11-30T00:45:48  <antimatroid> that's not quite worded right, something meeting that condition is a valid symmetry but a valid symmetry doesn't necessarily need to meet that
2011-11-30T00:46:34  <McLeopold> I wondering how I should pick a random symmetry, what the "correct" probabilities should be for each type
2011-11-30T00:46:40  <antimatroid> of course then you take the rotations these form and they would make a group under composition :P but now i'm just being silly
2011-11-30T00:46:57  <antimatroid> McLeopold: don't ask me, if you look in my map gen you'll see something awful :P
2011-11-30T00:47:00  <cuademon> How about a sierpinski rectangle map
2011-11-30T00:47:39  <McLeopold> I think all my symmetries ensure ant orientations are all vertical or all horizontal
2011-11-30T00:47:56  <McLeopold> If I had diagonals, I could fix that, but I need to ensure square maps
2011-11-30T00:48:06  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-30T00:48:28  <antimatroid> i wonder if people doing symmetry detection are doing it for all possible symmetries
2011-11-30T00:49:58  <McLeopold> antimatroid: have you looked at my symmetry code?
2011-11-30T00:50:10  <antimatroid> nope

2011-11-30T00:50:39  <McLeopold> basically, you can pick from 4 types for each direction (with some limitations) mirror, rotate180, copy, shear
2011-11-30T00:51:01  <McLeopold> you can't shear in 2 directions (I found out the hard way)
2011-11-30T00:51:15  <McLeopold> you can shear after a rotate or mirror either

2011-11-30T00:52:00  <antimatroid> mirror?
2011-11-30T00:52:01  <antimatroid> why?
2011-11-30T00:52:09  <McLeopold> so, I basically tileing the map
2011-11-30T00:52:27  <McLeopold> uh...
2011-11-30T00:52:31  <antimatroid> oh, i'm thinking of mirror as like a horizontal flip
2011-11-30T00:52:35  <McLeopold> it is
2011-11-30T00:52:47  <McLeopold> horizontal or verticle

2011-11-30T00:55:39  <cuademon> Oh, you could of course do the sierpinski triangle too with symmetry
2011-11-30T00:56:03  <antimatroid> a.b, mirrored is b.a
2011-11-30T00:56:03  <McLeopold> cuademon: I think you'd just have one map then?  No variations?
2011-11-30T00:56:13  <antimatroid> it has width 3
2011-11-30T00:56:14  <antimatroid> odd
2011-11-30T00:56:18  <cuademon> Well yea, one-off's
2011-11-30T00:56:39  <McLeopold> oh, I see, but I generate tiles of NxM and a grid size of XxY
2011-11-30T00:56:49  <antimatroid> what?
2011-11-30T00:57:07  <antimatroid> you do know m comes before n right? :P
2011-11-30T00:57:15  <McLeopold> so, my tile size is 5x5 and with 2 players a choose a grid size of 1x2, so the map size is 5x10
2011-11-30T00:57:21  <McLeopold> whatever :P
2011-11-30T00:58:06  <McLeopold> so the grid dimension needs to be even
2011-11-30T00:58:18  <antimatroid> why?
2011-11-30T00:58:26  <antimatroid> oh
2011-11-30T00:58:35  <antimatroid> no, still don't see why
2011-11-30T00:58:52  <McLeopold> try doing a mirror with 1x3 grid
2011-11-30T00:59:02  <McLeopold> 2 will be facing 2 the right, 1 to the left
2011-11-30T00:59:11  <McLeopold> >><>><>><
2011-11-30T00:59:52  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-11-30T01:00:18  <McLeopold> so, I could mirror a 5x5 tile, remove a column and get a 5x9, just for kicks
2011-11-30T01:00:53  <McLeopold> or add a special column for 5x11
2011-11-30T01:02:18  <McLeopold> I could probably do that with rotate180 and copy as well...
2011-11-30T01:02:30  <McLeopold> and shear...

2011-11-30T01:32:50  <thestinger> nice, I broke movement again
2011-11-30T01:34:50  <bmh> thestinger: *where*? I see you winning
2011-11-30T01:35:06  <thestinger> when my ants move forwards to attack, they leave a gap
2011-11-30T01:35:10  <BenJackson> I need tips for low-food maps
2011-11-30T01:35:12  <thestinger> I just need to rerun my movement code after combat
2011-11-30T01:35:22  <bmh> BenJackson: collect the most food?
2011-11-30T01:36:02  <BenJackson> I do ok at that
2011-11-30T01:36:04  <BenJackson> but I lose
2011-11-30T01:36:26  <thestinger> BenJackson: do you try to control territory?
2011-11-30T01:36:31  <thestinger> I've been thinking about implementing that
2011-11-30T01:36:38  <bmh> BenJackson: abandon your blasphemous ways and try rolling some Haskell?
2011-11-30T01:36:46  <BenJackson> well I "cover" it more than I "control" it
2011-11-30T01:36:52  <thestinger> like having a boundary which I expand - inside the boundary ants are spread evenly to gather food, and fighters will be around the edges
2011-11-30T01:37:06  <BenJackson> I like those kind of concepts
2011-11-30T01:37:11  <thestinger> atm I just fill up space with ants looking for food, but I don't have packs around the edges to hunt down enemies
2011-11-30T01:37:13  <BenJackson> but they're meaningless when you have 20 ants at turn 100
2011-11-30T01:37:31  <BenJackson> you can't turtle, but someone might go all-in on you
2011-11-30T01:37:40  <thestinger> well, I send a certain number of foragers out alone
2011-11-30T01:37:47  <thestinger> but my remaining ants explore in packs
2011-11-30T01:37:53  <BenJackson> I don't distinguish ants like that
2011-11-30T01:37:58  <thestinger> I don't either
2011-11-30T01:38:03  <thestinger> the ants are all equal at the start of a turn
2011-11-30T01:38:11  <thestinger> but I'll only send a certain number to "forage"
2011-11-30T01:38:24  <antimatroid> how do you decide how many ants to sent to enemies etc?
2011-11-30T01:38:30  <antimatroid> or do you just send them to the closest?
2011-11-30T01:38:39  <antimatroid> send*
2011-11-30T01:38:41  <BenJackson> I don't really decide directly
2011-11-30T01:38:42  <thestinger> I don't really decide on specific numbers
2011-11-30T01:38:48  <BenJackson> I optimize for various things and it just happens
2011-11-30T01:38:48  <thestinger> it's emergent based on where the targets are
2011-11-30T01:38:52  <BenJackson> hi51
2011-11-30T01:38:54  <BenJackson> hi5! rather
2011-11-30T01:39:09  <thestinger> like I don't set a limit to the number of foragers
2011-11-30T01:39:24  <thestinger> but it's basically impossible for all my ants to do foraging
2011-11-30T01:39:31  <antimatroid> i collect food after battling ants, invading enemy hills and protecting my own
2011-11-30T01:39:35  <BenJackson> I think I'm going to expand my unit testing
2011-11-30T01:39:41  <BenJackson> to test my bot against cheating versions of my bot
2011-11-30T01:39:50  <antimatroid> then i explore, then i'm not really sure what to do with the rest
2011-11-30T01:39:57  <antimatroid> ie. how many to sent towards enemies etc.
2011-11-30T01:40:31  <antimatroid> ie. can just send them to the nearest "target" but that seems unintelligent :P
2011-11-30T01:42:22  <BenJackson> I think what I messed up in this game is that a lone ant attacking my hill is normally killed by the defenders
2011-11-30T01:42:28  <BenJackson> but I had too few ants to have any defenders
2011-11-30T01:42:36  <BenJackson> and apparently didn't send someone over to investigate
2011-11-30T01:44:31  <thestinger> my bot is actually really good now that I finally have half-working combat
2011-11-30T01:44:57  <BenJackson> my bot does well on fluxid and tcpants but it's not doing that well on the challenge site
2011-11-30T01:45:09  <bmh> I certainly hope I don't run out of time for implementing combat. That would be disappointing
2011-11-30T01:45:11  <thestinger> it's a huge improvement over just dealing with unmoving enemies, which was a huge improvement over not dealing with enemies
2011-11-30T01:45:32  <BenJackson> bmh: it took me a week of pondering and tinkering to get anything going
2011-11-30T01:45:35  <BenJackson> and another week to refine it
2011-11-30T01:45:37  <thestinger> bmh: it's really easy if you just pretend enemies don't move, and it can't really make your bot worse
2011-11-30T01:45:37  <BenJackson> so get going :)
2011-11-30T01:46:01  <thestinger> I'm glad I started with the easy way
2011-11-30T01:46:29  <thestinger> I'm just doing incremental improvements, rather than trying to implement something perfectly
2011-11-30T01:46:51  <bmh> BenJackson: after burning diffusionBot, I'm trying to make something that actually works.
2011-11-30T01:47:36  <BenJackson> diffusion still provides general goal information that's useful to have around
2011-11-30T01:47:59  <bmh> it's too slow in Haskell. I tried to make it workable.
2011-11-30T01:48:11  <thestinger> I just use distance maps with lots of hacks
2011-11-30T01:48:28  <BenJackson> basically
2011-11-30T01:48:29  <thestinger> like treating nearby food as a cluster
2011-11-30T01:49:39  <bmh> I'm adopting the BFS approach. Each ant labels its food, bots without food go for unseen squares, and so on
2011-11-30T01:49:59  <BenJackson> the only good news in this game is that although I let my hill get capped at about turn 200 with only 24 ants I still took an enemy hill later
2011-11-30T01:51:28  <thestinger> bmh: yeah, I pretty much do that and it works very well
2011-11-30T01:51:42  <thestinger> BFS and multi-source BFS to make distance maps for various purposes
2011-11-30T01:51:43  <bmh> has anyone tried hill triangulation yet?
2011-11-30T01:51:54  <thestinger> and the distances are used to decision making and picking targets
2011-11-30T01:52:03  <thestinger> then for pathfinding to the targets
2011-11-30T01:52:20  <thestinger> and spreading is just hacked into the BFS for some things
2011-11-30T01:52:51  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/YZVP my whole bot is seriously based on that
2011-11-30T01:53:10  <thestinger> and it's 11 lines of code
2011-11-30T01:54:40  <thestinger> I looked at the collaborative diffusion stuff, but it seems like it just overcomplicates everything
2011-11-30T01:55:15  <bmh> thestinger: https://gist.github.com/1408291 there's my 'who owns what?' code
2011-11-30T01:56:01  <thestinger> so the closest ant to something owns it?
2011-11-30T01:56:16  <bmh> yes
2011-11-30T01:56:25  <thestinger> yeah, that's what I do for food and foraging

2011-11-30T02:06:21  <BenJackson> jeez, I bumped something while I was in my editor
2011-11-30T02:06:27  <BenJackson> I think I wordwrapped a bunch of python
2011-11-30T02:07:44  <thestinger> set undofile undodir=~/.vim/undo
2011-11-30T02:07:51  <thestinger> that has saved me from so many stupid editor mistakes
2011-11-30T02:08:03  <thestinger> persistent undo history, with undo trees (yay vim 7.3)
2011-11-30T02:08:07  <BenJackson> hah, a new test
2011-11-30T02:08:16  <BenJackson> all enemy ants get to know where my hill is
2011-11-30T02:08:21  <thestinger> I could almost live without git
2011-11-30T02:08:31  <thestinger> I basically have the entire editing history of my bot, and all the branches :P
2011-11-30T02:08:59  <thestinger> I think if I edit the file without vim I would lose it all tho
2011-11-30T02:09:21  <BenJackson> honestly I don't like vim that much
2011-11-30T02:09:25  <BenJackson> I'm a huge fan of vi
2011-11-30T02:09:39  <thestinger> vim takes a lot of configuration before it's sane
2011-11-30T02:09:45  <BenJackson> vim to me is like "color ls"
2011-11-30T02:09:51  <BenJackson> or maybe I should say "color ls by default"
2011-11-30T02:09:56  <BenJackson> that shit is not unix, man
2011-11-30T02:09:58  <thestinger> you should see my shell :P
2011-11-30T02:10:16  <BenJackson> if you can't do it on a z29 it doesn't belong on my terminal :)
2011-11-30T02:10:30  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vYmlyNQ process name completion
2011-11-30T02:10:30  <BenJackson> I like mutt (the mailreader) but I wish it didn't want to control the colors
2011-11-30T02:10:41  <BenJackson> I use it monochrome anyway, but it insists on setting the background and fg colors
2011-11-30T02:11:03  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vYmlyNg pid completion :)
2011-11-30T02:11:48  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vYmlyNw documentation for commands is nice, I'm too lazy to use man and too stupid to remember all the git switches
2011-11-30T02:11:59  <BenJackson> http://ompldr.org/iYmlyOA
2011-11-30T02:12:02  <BenJackson> there's my new unit test
2011-11-30T02:12:03  <thestinger> and ofc, completion for files uses LS_COLORS
2011-11-30T02:12:15  <BenJackson> http://ompldr.org/vYmlyOA
2011-11-30T02:12:22  <thestinger> nice
2011-11-30T02:12:50  <BenJackson> that last clause is '.. or it's player 0's hill and this isn't player 0'
2011-11-30T02:12:59  <thestinger> you really don't like vim? xD
2011-11-30T02:13:08  <thestinger> but vi doesn't have nice text-object stuff :(
2011-11-30T02:13:20  <BenJackson> I've never gotten any of the really advanced vim stuff to work anyway
2011-11-30T02:13:22  <thestinger> ciw, caw, ci{, ci(, ci"
2011-11-30T02:13:24  <BenJackson> like cscope integration
2011-11-30T02:13:30  <BenJackson> what is ciw?
2011-11-30T02:13:35  <thestinger> change inner word
2011-11-30T02:13:42  <thestinger> so you can cw for the whole word without being at the start
2011-11-30T02:13:47  <BenJackson> huh
2011-11-30T02:13:50  <thestinger> ci" is the same thing for something like "some horrible string"
2011-11-30T02:13:57  <thestinger> ci( ci{ are the same idea
2011-11-30T02:14:11  <BenJackson> I might use those
2011-11-30T02:14:12  <thestinger> caw is "change a word", it just gets the space at the end too
2011-11-30T02:14:27  <BenJackson> how's that different from cW ?
2011-11-30T02:14:37  <thestinger> cause you can be in the middle of the word, like ciw
2011-11-30T02:14:41  <BenJackson> ah
2011-11-30T02:15:58  <thestinger> and = is nice to autoindent stuff

2011-11-30T02:16:18  <BenJackson> before vim I used nvi mostly
2011-11-30T02:16:27  <BenJackson> it's just that vim is installed everywhere now so I've given in
2011-11-30T02:16:29  <BenJackson> sort of like using bash
2011-11-30T02:16:34  <BenJackson> I prefer zsh but bash is everywhere
2011-11-30T02:16:39  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T02:17:00  <thestinger> readline is used everywhere too (bash, python, ruby, etc...)
2011-11-30T02:17:09  <thestinger> so I had to figure out readline keybinds
2011-11-30T02:17:10  <BenJackson> the thing that made me sure the vim was "wrong" is that it does multi-undo differently than nvi
2011-11-30T02:17:17  <thestinger> you can change the setting
2011-11-30T02:17:23  <BenJackson> and as a long time vi (att vi) user when I wanted multi-undo in nvi I just.. did it
2011-11-30T02:17:25  <thestinger> you can make u incremental or just go back and forth between two things
2011-11-30T02:17:26  <BenJackson> I didn't even know how
2011-11-30T02:17:27  <BenJackson> but it did it right
2011-11-30T02:17:30  <BenJackson> vim does not
2011-11-30T02:17:38  <thestinger> vim has awesome undo/redo :P
2011-11-30T02:17:40  <thestinger> it makes trees
2011-11-30T02:17:42  <BenJackson> I still couldn't tell you what vim does without trying it
2011-11-30T02:17:52  <thestinger> u just does 1 incremental undo
2011-11-30T02:17:57  <thestinger> C-R does 1 incremental redo
2011-11-30T02:18:01  <thestinger> in the current branch
2011-11-30T02:18:24  <BenJackson> in nvi u undoes, and u undoes the undo (just like old skool) but u . . . undose multiple
2011-11-30T02:18:45  <thestinger> you can 'set compatible' in vim and it works pretty much like vi
2011-11-30T02:18:56  <BenJackson> (so I thought I'd have to write an extra suicidal bot to ensure early attacks for this setup, but one of my old bots happily does it already)
2011-11-30T02:19:17  <thestinger> clang_complete is also something I couldn't live without now
2011-11-30T02:19:24  <BenJackson> oh yeah the first thing I had to learn about vim was "syn off"

2011-11-30T02:19:29  <thestinger> having to refer to docs is horrible :P
2011-11-30T02:19:44  <BenJackson> based on what people do with ls --color and default vim you'd think everyone uses only one terminal background color
2011-11-30T02:19:50  <BenJackson> I color code terminals with background
2011-11-30T02:19:59  <thestinger> I use zenburn everything
2011-11-30T02:20:02  <BenJackson> so typically with syn on I can't read one class of things (whatever matches the background)
2011-11-30T02:20:10  <thestinger> not really because I like it, but because it's good enough and I like the consistency
2011-11-30T02:20:18  <BenJackson> I should try clang_complete
2011-11-30T02:20:22  <BenJackson> the cscope stuff never worked well
2011-11-30T02:21:17  <BenJackson> oh I should unbind whatever key it is that puts you in "record macro" mode because I get there a lot by accident
2011-11-30T02:21:30  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vYmlyYw clang complete does this
2011-11-30T02:21:37  <thestinger> BenJackson: q, just hit q again to get out :P

2011-11-30T02:34:31  <antimatroid> what do you guys mean by that?
2011-11-30T02:34:32  <bhasker> with ants/food and edge squares
2011-11-30T02:34:39  <bhasker> as the source
2011-11-30T02:34:45  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I posted pics of that :)
2011-11-30T02:34:46  <bhasker> and move ant to closest point
2011-11-30T02:34:56  <thestinger> antimatroid: http://sprunge.us/OiPF
2011-11-30T02:35:03  <antimatroid> are you doing multiple bfs? or simultaneous bfss? or just one bfs to move all ants and not letting two ants search the same location for a path?
2011-11-30T02:35:05  <thestinger> the basis of my entire bot is just distance maps like that now
2011-11-30T02:35:10  <bhasker> just one BFS
2011-11-30T02:35:17  <bhasker> no pathing
2011-11-30T02:35:23  <thestinger> I make _many_ distance maps every turn though
2011-11-30T02:35:36  <thestinger> foraging uses one, searching for/attacking enemy hills uses another
2011-11-30T02:35:40  <bhasker> right now it does something like this
2011-11-30T02:35:54  <bhasker> add any enemy hills as sources, add my hill as source
2011-11-30T02:35:55  <antimatroid> or is it path find from targets and move an ant every time you come across one?
2011-11-30T02:35:58  <bhasker> if its in danger
2011-11-30T02:36:15  <bhasker> if queue is still empty then add all known food/enemyAnts and edge locations as sources
2011-11-30T02:36:26  <bhasker> do a BFS
2011-11-30T02:36:42  <bhasker> for each ant pick the lowest number around it and move to it
2011-11-30T02:36:56  <bhasker> so ants will route to food/enemy or edge whichever is closest to them
2011-11-30T02:37:01  <thestinger> yeah, that's what I started with and I've just built up on that
2011-11-30T02:37:07  <bhasker> if enemy hills are visible they move to that
2011-11-30T02:37:13  <bhasker> if my hill is in danger they should move to my hill
2011-11-30T02:37:20  <antimatroid> do you order the ants before picking their moves?
2011-11-30T02:37:23  <bhasker> no
2011-11-30T02:37:26  <antimatroid> so you move the ants closest to a target first?
2011-11-30T02:37:35  <bhasker> ah that i used to do that
2011-11-30T02:37:37  <antimatroid> i would have thought that would be worthwhile, hence just searching from the targets to ants
2011-11-30T02:37:41  <bhasker> not anymore
2011-11-30T02:37:54  <bhasker> though my main problem right now seems to be combat
2011-11-30T02:37:57  <bhasker> my bot is horrible at it
2011-11-30T02:38:01  <antimatroid> why not anymore?
2011-11-30T02:38:01  <bhasker> keeps losing ants
2011-11-30T02:38:02  <bhasker> :(
2011-11-30T02:38:12  <bhasker> this bfs seems to decently in most maps
2011-11-30T02:38:18  <bhasker> so i will work one xploration once i fix combat a bit
2011-11-30T02:38:28  <thestinger> bhasker: do you revisit locations you've already explored to look for food?
2011-11-30T02:38:29  <antimatroid> how does everyone work out not visible info?
2011-11-30T02:38:38  <bhasker> yes it will do that
2011-11-30T02:38:40  <antimatroid> just go through the entire grid and add the locations to the search queue?
2011-11-30T02:38:51  <bhasker> i basically add the following locations
2011-11-30T02:38:53  <bhasker> as sources
2011-11-30T02:39:03  <bhasker> namely a square which has no water squares adjacent to it
2011-11-30T02:39:10  <thestinger> antimatroid: I have a list of unseen locations and I just pass it into my templated 'make a map for these targets' function
2011-11-30T02:39:12  <bhasker> and has at least one square that has is not currently visible adjacent
2011-11-30T02:39:24  <antimatroid> thestinger: but what about seen but not recently seen? :P
2011-11-30T02:39:29  <BenJackson> I do something similar to thestinger but I compute the frontier of that set first
2011-11-30T02:39:34  <bhasker> if it meets these two criteria its considered an edge square
2011-11-30T02:39:39  <thestinger> antimatroid: well, I have two categories of exploration
2011-11-30T02:39:45  *** kire <kire!~kire@78-22-125-201.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-30T02:39:55  <thestinger> I have "foraging" which sends 1 ant to a target, and revisits last_seen locations
2011-11-30T02:40:06  <thestinger> and then exploration with the purpose of finding hills
2011-11-30T02:40:31  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.5554
2011-11-30T02:40:39  <thestinger> you can see that some ants go off by themselves and others go in groups
2011-11-30T02:40:54  <thestinger> that's just emergent
2011-11-30T02:41:03  <thestinger> strcat_flock is an attempt to encourage the packs of ants
2011-11-30T02:41:31  <bmh> sweet. Timeout Bot v1 is complete. I'm going to bed.
2011-11-30T02:41:38  <thestinger> getting foraging right just took tons of tweaking
2011-11-30T02:41:39  *** bmh <bmh!ada4e181@fsf/member/bmh> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-11-30T02:41:52  <thestinger> I had to run bots against each other in big open maps to get the right values for things
2011-11-30T02:42:05  <thestinger> still not perfect :)
2011-11-30T02:42:20  <bhasker> what i do as a preprocess step is to buildSquads
2011-11-30T02:42:27  <BenJackson> http://paste.aichallenge.org/UkIGk/
2011-11-30T02:42:30  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-30T02:42:31  <bhasker> if there are enemyAnts nearby i build squads
2011-11-30T02:42:31  <BenJackson> just go to the very end
2011-11-30T02:42:36  <bhasker> otherwise each squad is just one ant
2011-11-30T02:42:44  <BenJackson> I'm not proud of that
2011-11-30T02:42:45  <bhasker> so when they encounter enemies they tend to bunch up
2011-11-30T02:43:35  <thestinger> I think my flocking code actually screws up combat
2011-11-30T02:43:40  <thestinger> because they don't form a nice line of combat
2011-11-30T02:43:52  <BenJackson> yup, same thing happened to me
2011-11-30T02:44:24  <thestinger> the spreading behavior I have is what causes the lines to actually form, and _flock reduces the effect of that
2011-11-30T02:45:54  <BenJackson> http://paste.aichallenge.org/UkIGk/?row=74&col=133&turn=1499
2011-11-30T02:45:56  <BenJackson> there, direct link
2011-11-30T02:46:29  <thestinger> BenJackson: will your ants try to take alternate routes?
2011-11-30T02:46:53  <BenJackson> not that specifically
2011-11-30T02:46:55  <BenJackson> obviously
2011-11-30T02:46:57  <thestinger> I get pile ups like that, but not when there's a somewhat longer alternate route
2011-11-30T02:47:04  <thestinger> if it's much longer, they'll still pile up
2011-11-30T02:47:38  <BenJackson> if you back the turns up you'll see I make some progress on the other side
2011-11-30T02:48:41  <thestinger> http://paste.aichallenge.org/UkIGk/?row=46&col=7&turn=1499
2011-11-30T02:48:50  <thestinger> my ants would take that route and form another pile up :)
2011-11-30T02:48:58  <thestinger> I hate that map
2011-11-30T02:48:58  <BenJackson> it's funny that this happened because every ant knew where red's base was at the start
2011-11-30T02:49:03  <BenJackson> I was going to debug that scenario
2011-11-30T02:49:05  <BenJackson> but it won anyway
2011-11-30T02:49:39  *** epicmonkey <epicmonkey!~epicmonke@178.130.5.103> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2011-11-30T02:50:04  * BenJackson turns the food down even more
2011-11-30T02:50:53  <thestinger> gcc doesn't implement std::array properly :(
2011-11-30T02:50:59  <BenJackson> at the moment I'm like this ninja 300th place bot on aichallenge
2011-11-30T02:51:04  <BenJackson> I keep having these wtf games and losing
2011-11-30T02:51:11  <bhasker> std::vector you mean?
2011-11-30T02:51:13  <BenJackson> meanwhile I cause other bots to have wtf games where they lose to me
2011-11-30T02:51:24  <thestinger> bhasker: no, std::array (C++11, fixed size stack allocated array)
2011-11-30T02:51:51  <BenJackson> what's wrong with it?
2011-11-30T02:51:53  <thestinger> std::array<std::array<int, 2>, 4> a; is a 4x2 array for example
2011-11-30T02:52:01  <BenJackson> I saw someone complaining about the alignment on stackoverflow
2011-11-30T02:52:08  <thestinger> {{0, 0}, {0, 0} ... }
2011-11-30T02:52:14  <thestinger> gcc treats it like a struct
2011-11-30T02:52:26  <thestinger> so you need an extra pair of curly braces, and it does something really weird with 2d ones
2011-11-30T02:52:36  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-11-30T02:52:48  <bhasker> i haven't really looked at the C++11 stuff
2011-11-30T02:52:54  <thestinger> lots of it is amazing
2011-11-30T02:53:02  <thestinger> unordered_set and unordered_map (hash tables)
2011-11-30T02:53:05  <bhasker> hmm maybe i should look at it sometime
2011-11-30T02:53:14  <bhasker> most of it is just boost being folded in?
2011-11-30T02:53:20  <thestinger> tr1 and boost
2011-11-30T02:53:24  <bhasker> yea
2011-11-30T02:53:27  <thestinger> std::array is boost::array
2011-11-30T02:53:42  <thestinger> for {auto &v : container } { std::cout << v << std::endl; }
2011-11-30T02:53:50  <thestinger> range-based for loops, auto is type inference now
2011-11-30T02:53:56  <bhasker> ah yea i read that
2011-11-30T02:54:03  <bhasker> makes it easy to type C++ !
2011-11-30T02:54:08  <thestinger> gcc 4.5 doesn't actually have the ranged based for, so you have to use the old iterator syntax for now
2011-11-30T02:54:12  <thestinger> on the server
2011-11-30T02:54:17  <bhasker> instead of map<int,vector<Location> >::const_iterator!
2011-11-30T02:54:23  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T02:54:40  <bhasker> hmm my mac comes with 4.2.1
2011-11-30T02:54:40  <thestinger> there's .cbegin() and .cend() for getting the const_iterator instead of an iterator
2011-11-30T02:54:48  <thestinger> bhasker: yeah, apple hates the GPLv3
2011-11-30T02:54:48  <bhasker> i doubt it supports most of the c++11x syntax
2011-11-30T02:54:58  <thestinger> just install gcc
2011-11-30T02:55:00  <thestinger> that's not 10 years old
2011-11-30T02:55:01  <bhasker> a lot of people hate gplv4
2011-11-30T02:55:02  <thestinger> :P
2011-11-30T02:55:04  <bhasker> gplv3
2011-11-30T02:55:15  <bhasker> freebsd moved to clang for its core because of that
2011-11-30T02:55:17  <thestinger> it means they can't sue you for using their code
2011-11-30T02:55:18  <bhasker> from gcc
2011-11-30T02:55:26  <thestinger> like if they had a patent on some compiler thing
2011-11-30T02:55:33  <thestinger> and they distributed GPLv3 software using it
2011-11-30T02:55:46  <thestinger> they couldn't sue something for using their code which uses the patent
2011-11-30T02:55:53  <thestinger> and apple likes suing people :)
2011-11-30T02:55:59  <bhasker> heh
2011-11-30T02:56:10  <thestinger> clang 2.9 supports some C++11 stuff
2011-11-30T02:56:11  <bhasker> damn implementing minmax for combat is going to be painful
2011-11-30T02:56:12  <thestinger> not enough
2011-11-30T02:56:17  <thestinger> I think 2.9 is like a year old
2011-11-30T02:56:36  <thestinger> lambdas are the thing I really like in C++11 :)
2011-11-30T02:56:41  <bhasker> all this is moot anyway nodejs is the new fancy way of writing stuff
2011-11-30T02:56:52  <bhasker> javascript 4tw
2011-11-30T02:56:56  <thestinger> auto f = [](int i) { return i * 2; }
2011-11-30T02:57:05  <thestinger> it infers the return type but you can explicitly add ->int
2011-11-30T02:57:26  <thestinger> auto f = [this](int i) { this->number = i * 2; }
2011-11-30T02:57:26  <bhasker> a year from now c++ will be a completly new language
2011-11-30T02:57:35  <thestinger> and then pass f into a function
2011-11-30T02:57:38  <bhasker> then people will dump javascript and goback to c++
2011-11-30T02:57:58  <bhasker> any of you done any nodejs programming
2011-11-30T02:57:59  <BenJackson> thestinger: I'd be curious to see an example of your lambda-based bot stuff
2011-11-30T02:58:08  <BenJackson> I've never had occasion to use c++11
2011-11-30T02:58:11  <BenJackson> but I like Scala a lot
2011-11-30T02:58:15  <bhasker> same here Ben
2011-11-30T02:58:19  <thestinger> I like haskell a lot :)
2011-11-30T02:58:28  <bhasker> i like c++ everything else is annoying
2011-11-30T02:58:30  <antimatroid> some of you are bfsing from the targets to sources yeah?
2011-11-30T02:58:31  <thestinger> I couldn't figure out how to do a generic BFS implementation without lambdas for example
2011-11-30T02:58:34  <bhasker> javascript is the worst of the lot
2011-11-30T02:58:40  <antimatroid> that works really nicely if you just want to move each ant to the closest target
2011-11-30T02:59:09  <thestinger> BenJackson: one of the things I've ended up doing is passing a lambda which sets something in an object to a generic function
2011-11-30T02:59:20  <thestinger> so I can have a generic algorithm which is used for completely different things
2011-11-30T02:59:43  <thestinger> like the lambda could be passed the Location and the distance for each step of a BFS
2011-11-30T03:00:02  <thestinger> and set something based on that using references it has to objects the generic function doesn't need to know about
2011-11-30T03:00:13  <BenJackson> thestinger I get it, I'd just be curious to see what it looks like in c++11
2011-11-30T03:00:16  <BenJackson> maybe after the contest
2011-11-30T03:00:22  <BenJackson> what I did was write a bfs iterator
2011-11-30T03:00:43  <BenJackson> bfs(state, start_loc) ... bfs != end, *bfs is a loc
2011-11-30T03:00:56  <antimatroid> bhasker: if you search from targets to ants you don't need to order them :P
2011-11-30T03:01:05  *** Conorach <Conorach!~cono@150.pool85-61-56.dynamic.orange.es> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-30T03:01:17  <thestinger> one of the things I have is a function which sets radius info (for setting last_seen with viewradius around my ants, etc.)
2011-11-30T03:01:35  <thestinger> so I basically pass it a "setter" using a lambda
2011-11-30T03:01:44  <antimatroid> yeah i have bombVisionInfo and bombPathVisionInfo
2011-11-30T03:02:01  * antimatroid shuts up now :P
2011-11-30T03:02:05  <thestinger> I use it to mark attackradius around enemies, attackradius+1, etc.
2011-11-30T03:02:14  <thestinger> before I had to have the same code written out 4 times
2011-11-30T03:02:30  <McLeopold> bhasker: I really like javascript
2011-11-30T03:02:36  <thestinger> not sure how to do code reuse like that without higher-order functions
2011-11-30T03:02:40  <BenJackson> yeah, I've done similar things with functors
2011-11-30T03:02:48  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T03:02:49  <BenJackson> but lambdas would be nicer in some ways
2011-11-30T03:02:56  <thestinger> my higher-order functions take std::function as an argument
2011-11-30T03:03:04  <BenJackson> but I like functors because I know my inner loop isn't going to invoke a function pointer
2011-11-30T03:03:04  <thestinger> which is generic - it can be a function pointer, functor or lambda :)
2011-11-30T03:03:11  <BenJackson> it's going to inline my trivial "seen" test or whatever
2011-11-30T03:03:25  <BenJackson> yeah I'm not hip to std::function
2011-11-30T03:03:30  <thestinger> std::function<void(int)> f;
2011-11-30T03:03:35  <BenJackson> I rarely get to write C++ this freeform
2011-11-30T03:03:45  <BenJackson> usually I'm stuck inside a 10 year old framework of cruft
2011-11-30T03:03:50  <thestinger> the C++11 stuff is really nice, and it's mostly in boost
2011-11-30T03:03:52  <BenJackson> working with people who are slightly scared of std::vector
2011-11-30T03:03:58  <thestinger> lol :)
2011-11-30T03:03:59  *** g0llum <g0llum!~g0llum@89.204.153.54> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-30T03:04:13  <thestinger> another C++11 thing I use is emplace
2011-11-30T03:04:16  <BenJackson> in fairness they may well be putting the contents of their array into FPGA registers
2011-11-30T03:04:21  <BenJackson> so I can understand wanting precise control
2011-11-30T03:04:32  <thestinger> so vec.emplace_back(row, col) instead of vec.push_back(Location(row, col)) which has to move/copy it
2011-11-30T03:04:57  <BenJackson> ehhh I bet the assembly is the same
2011-11-30T03:04:59  <thestinger> nope
2011-11-30T03:05:02  <thestinger> not at all
2011-11-30T03:05:18  <BenJackson> keep in mind vec.push_back(Location(r,c)) is going to be entirely inlined
2011-11-30T03:05:25  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T03:05:30  <thestinger> it still ends up using more instructions
2011-11-30T03:05:36  <thestinger> not sure why
2011-11-30T03:05:47  <thestinger> like .insert() isn't optimized to the same code as .push_back()
2011-11-30T03:05:56  <thestinger> I think gcc must have special cases for everything
2011-11-30T03:06:16  <thestinger> like memset() turns into the same code as a for loop for a tiny array
2011-11-30T03:06:16  <BenJackson> I've hacked on gcc internals a few times
2011-11-30T03:06:28  <BenJackson> it's scary in there
2011-11-30T03:06:52  <BenJackson> what's special cased is crazy complex and what's "generic" is so generic you can't tell what it does or when it's invoked
2011-11-30T03:06:57  <thestinger> lol
2011-11-30T03:07:05  <BenJackson> gdb is the worst
2011-11-30T03:07:10  <thestinger> I hate gdb
2011-11-30T03:07:16  <thestinger> I've tried using it, it's not helpful
2011-11-30T03:07:21  <BenJackson> half the functions in there are just wrappers that permute the arguments and call through some other function pointer
2011-11-30T03:07:26  <BenJackson> and that will go on 8 layers deep
2011-11-30T03:07:36  <thestinger> I would rather stick print statements everywhere than use gdb
2011-11-30T03:07:47  <thestinger> anyway I haven't had any weird problems in C++ like I have in C
2011-11-30T03:07:51  <BenJackson> more than once I've modified gdb, recompiled, and found that I didn't even remotely modify the right code
2011-11-30T03:07:59  <BenJackson> also have you ever tried to run gdb under gdb?
2011-11-30T03:08:13  <thestinger> lol
2011-11-30T03:08:13  <BenJackson> luckily they made a movie about that so I don't have to explain it...  INCEPTION
2011-11-30T03:08:46  <BenJackson> yeah I do mostly concurrent programming (and/or realtime) and so I find gdb pretty useless
2011-11-30T03:08:58  <thestinger> I like how most libraries completely spam valgrind output
2011-11-30T03:08:59  <BenJackson> if I stop at a breakpoitn usually the world is totally fucked
2011-11-30T03:09:35  <BenJackson> ok to repro this game on aichallenge I lost I basically have to set min food
2011-11-30T03:09:35  <thestinger> GNU cat isn't even capable of running under valgrind without 300 errors

2011-11-30T03:12:18  <thestinger> I guess they rely on crazy hacks for speed
2011-11-30T03:15:22  <BenJackson> I think after freebsd unified the vm and buffercache there was a version of copy that was mmap, mmap, memcpy

2011-11-30T03:16:34  <thestinger> gcc is hit or miss on even basic stuff
2011-11-30T03:16:48  <thestinger> but gcc must be full of special cases and hacks because it makes faster code
2011-11-30T03:17:02  <thestinger> clang has a long way to go before they catch up

2011-11-30T03:22:58  <bhasker> hmm what is --scenario?
2011-11-30T03:23:05  <bhasker> is that an option to the map maker?
2011-11-30T03:23:11  <a1k0n> no, to the game engine
2011-11-30T03:23:15  <thestinger> it lets you run maps with food/ants preplaced
2011-11-30T03:23:17  <g0llum> no, to playgame
2011-11-30T03:23:18  <a1k0n> you can run a non-symmetrical map with some pre-positioned ants/etc
2011-11-30T03:23:30  <a1k0n> a scenario, if you will
2011-11-30T03:23:35  <bhasker> oh
2011-11-30T03:23:40  <bhasker> didn't know that
2011-11-30T03:23:52  <thestinger> I found it extremely useful for getting combat working
2011-11-30T03:23:55  <a1k0n> so all my improvements suck.  i think i've had enough of this contest for a while
2011-11-30T03:24:36  <bhasker> how does that work , if you give that option does it just tell playgame to not spawn new food etc?
2011-11-30T03:24:48  <a1k0n> well you have to say --food none to tell it not to spawn new food
2011-11-30T03:24:58  <thestinger> a1k0n: now you can write a bot in brainfuck :)
2011-11-30T03:25:00  <a1k0n> but if you include 'a's and 'b's on your map it will put ants there
2011-11-30T03:25:06  <a1k0n> thestinger: haha.  is it supported?
2011-11-30T03:25:18  <bhasker> oh nice
2011-11-30T03:25:22  <bhasker> so easy to test combat then
2011-11-30T03:25:24  <a1k0n> i think the default brainfuck only has 64k memory
2011-11-30T03:25:24  <bhasker> in a sandbox
2011-11-30T03:25:28  <thestinger> a1k0n: you can compile it to C
2011-11-30T03:25:49  <a1k0n> well i'd be doing source lang->brainfuck->C so that'd just be silly
2011-11-30T03:26:01  <thestinger> well you could make a starter package xD
2011-11-30T03:26:28  <thestinger> http://www.hamsterfestdestiny.org/hamster/
2011-11-30T03:27:20  <thestinger> I bet the brainfuck -> LLVM -> machine code way turns into something almost reasonable

2011-11-30T03:31:41  <a1k0n> i should fix the bug where sometimes my ants are indecisive about collecting food
2011-11-30T03:31:44  <thestinger> maybe the rankings are screwed up somehow
2011-11-30T03:31:49  <a1k0n> but i need a break for a while
2011-11-30T03:31:58  <a1k0n> pguillory hasn't come back top the top yet either
2011-11-30T03:32:16  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2255 finally dropped from 20 to 27
2011-11-30T03:32:21  <a1k0n> i guess his go bot isn't as good
2011-11-30T03:32:41  <BenJackson> he's doing way better than me
2011-11-30T03:33:01  <antimatroid> has anyone tried an expanding perimeter around their bot for defense?
2011-11-30T03:33:05  <BenJackson> I also had an early matchup with xathis but lost mine
2011-11-30T03:33:13  <thestinger> wow, ChrisH is shooting to the top
2011-11-30T03:33:38  <cuademon> ChrisH has time trouble
2011-11-30T03:34:29  <a1k0n> he does?
2011-11-30T03:34:40  <cuademon> Seems to max out somewhere around 120 ants
2011-11-30T03:34:45  <thestinger> the plan9-like Go compilers aren't very good
2011-11-30T03:34:49  <BenJackson> a1k0n beat him in the second to last game, no prob ;-)
2011-11-30T03:34:54  <cuademon> Atleast in the couple games I looked at
2011-11-30T03:35:05  <antimatroid> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=4852
2011-11-30T03:35:13  <antimatroid> how did that person win the game against chrisH etc?
2011-11-30T03:35:42  <thestinger> they rushed and got more points
2011-11-30T03:35:45  <a1k0n> points
2011-11-30T03:35:52  <thestinger> stupid random walks.
2011-11-30T03:35:55  <a1k0n> a lot of the top bots are almost too cautious
2011-11-30T03:36:06  <BenJackson> that's been a big problem for me
2011-11-30T03:36:12  <BenJackson> my old one was aggressive because it was stupid
2011-11-30T03:36:13  <a1k0n> mine isn't cautious and probably doesn't deserve to be a top bot but it does get a lot of points
2011-11-30T03:36:18  <thestinger> a1k0n: yeah, that's why my ancient bot climbed so high
2011-11-30T03:36:26  <thestinger> it's terrible, but it gets points early on
2011-11-30T03:36:47  <a1k0n> yeah.  if you're only up against good bots, you lose.  if there are less-good bots thrown in the mix you win.
2011-11-30T03:36:55  <a1k0n> a very noisy game.
2011-11-30T03:37:11  <antimatroid> ahh, so upsets aren't as uncommon as i thought they would be
2011-11-30T03:37:21  <antimatroid> you had to be careful about who your competition was with planet wars
2011-11-30T03:37:30  <BenJackson> antimatroid: they are if you accept my premise that my bot should be ranked higher ;-)
2011-11-30T03:37:41  <antimatroid> :p
2011-11-30T03:37:47  <a1k0n> yeah, and here you can't really model your opponents until later in the game as you don't have too much information

2011-11-30T03:50:16  <sf17k> your tron postmortem inspired some ideas
2011-11-30T03:50:35  <sf17k> particularly the voronoi stuff
2011-11-30T03:50:52  <Fluxid> 01:16:17 < BenJackson> @seen fluxid ← were you looking for me?
2011-11-30T03:51:21  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-11-30T03:51:21  <Fluxid> thestinger: i dived into reorganizing the code and ended up going to sleep with unfixed segfaults
2011-11-30T03:51:37  <BenJackson> while I was making those bfs animations I relized how you could subtly make a bfs extra slow
2011-11-30T03:51:40  <BenJackson> but you don't have that bug
2011-11-30T03:52:23  <Fluxid> :)
2011-11-30T03:53:08  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.5622 ouch
2011-11-30T03:54:43  <BenJackson> why those airholes by the wall?
2011-11-30T03:54:49  <sf17k> I like how blue progressively stopped moving
2011-11-30T03:55:21  <BenJackson> you do some nice work against orange
2011-11-30T03:55:23  <thestinger> BenJackson: the 2 holes in the pile up?
2011-11-30T03:55:28  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-11-30T03:55:39  <thestinger> that's just an artifact of my spreading code
2011-11-30T03:55:47  <thestinger> they spread by taking alternate paths
2011-11-30T03:55:52  <thestinger> they had no reason to move to those tiles
2011-11-30T03:56:24  <thestinger> I can adjust a constant by +1 and they would have filled those
2011-11-30T03:57:02  <thestinger> I'm not sure why they don't attack the orange ant
2011-11-30T03:57:16  <thestinger> that's a bug
2011-11-30T03:57:29  <sf17k> guys, I know how to combat. I juts don't feel like implementing it yet
2011-11-30T03:59:05  <thestinger> somehow the blue ant on the other side of the wall makes them not attack the orange ant :\
2011-11-30T03:59:11  <thestinger> that's going to be fun to debug...
2011-11-30T03:59:38  <a1k0n> sf17k: are you using the voronoi stuff for this?  i thought about it, but haven't
2011-11-30T03:59:55  <sf17k> I will be
2011-11-30T04:00:00  <a1k0n> also i don't think i know how to combat
2011-11-30T04:00:12  <sf17k> it seems like it'd be useful in cornering ants
2011-11-30T04:00:25  <thestinger> maybe that would be a good way to do territory control
2011-11-30T04:00:26  <a1k0n> yeah, very possibly
2011-11-30T04:00:32  <thestinger> I'm trying to implement that atm
2011-11-30T04:00:34  <sf17k> thestinger: exactly
2011-11-30T04:00:55  <a1k0n> i guess if you need a tiebreaker for a move in the presence of enemies, it would help
2011-11-30T04:01:05  <thestinger> strcat_nationalism will be ready in a few days :)
2011-11-30T04:01:24  <a1k0n> also the whole... counting the edges thing can also help, as you don't want to go into a corner or a dead-end
2011-11-30T04:02:22  <thestinger> I beat A :)
2011-11-30T04:02:36  <sf17k> a1k0n: for combat, you find the pixels currently under attack by the enemy, and go around their border looking for the shortest straight horizontal/vertical/diagonal stretches
2011-11-30T04:02:41  <thestinger> but then BenJackson murdered me
2011-11-30T04:02:54  <sf17k> one ant has stretches of 2 on the corners, and stretches of 3 on the sides
2011-11-30T04:02:55  <BenJackson> the old standby
2011-11-30T04:03:12  <sf17k> the goal is to place your ants on the shortest ones
2011-11-30T04:03:14  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.5659 that map is kind of annoying
2011-11-30T04:03:16  <BenJackson> I'm starting to hink my dumb old bot on fluxid is the only thing keeping us honest ;-)
2011-11-30T04:03:33  <sf17k> as that will always give you the most optimal loss ratio
2011-11-30T04:03:40  <BenJackson> I've playtested that map a lot
2011-11-30T04:03:40  <sf17k> because it's the "greatest concave"
2011-11-30T04:04:17  <thestinger> BenJackson: if you started next to A maybe I could have won :P
2011-11-30T04:04:17  <sf17k> you rally your forces 2 steps away, then move in all at once
2011-11-30T04:04:28  <BenJackson> yes, that map is like that
2011-11-30T04:04:35  <BenJackson> that's one reason it's a good test map
2011-11-30T04:04:55  <BenJackson> you can bias things so that your old versions get a boost against your new version
2011-11-30T04:04:59  <BenJackson> by pairing them against a weaker bot
2011-11-30T04:05:22  <a1k0n> sf17k: yeah but the enemy ants can move
2011-11-30T04:05:34  <sf17k> yes. 1 step away is the "hold line", which you want to attack all at once in case they move forward
2011-11-30T04:05:35  <a1k0n> but yeah i agree that's probably a good way to do it
2011-11-30T04:05:37  <sf17k> which is why you rally 2 steps away
2011-11-30T04:06:52  <sf17k> I guarantee it's the best way to do it without predicting your enemy's movements
2011-11-30T04:07:20  <a1k0n> i just predict my enemy's movements badly
2011-11-30T04:07:41  <sf17k> heh nice
2011-11-30T04:08:21  <a1k0n> i basically just try random things from both sides, and bias the sampling distribution towards moves that tend to be better on average
2011-11-30T04:08:33  <sf17k> ah interesting
2011-11-30T04:08:56  <sf17k> yeah I've been studying mechanics intently
2011-11-30T04:09:00  <a1k0n> of course it makes my advancing an entire line of ants at once extremely improbable
2011-11-30T04:09:08  <a1k0n> and so i tend to get a lot of suicides
2011-11-30T04:09:16  <BenJackson> my ant does totally unexpected things
2011-11-30T04:09:24  <BenJackson> I didn't code it to try to make it execute some battle plan
2011-11-30T04:09:27  <BenJackson> just to maximize some function
2011-11-30T04:09:32  <a1k0n> (same here)
2011-11-30T04:09:33  <sf17k> I wish I was as good at implementation as I think I am at theory
2011-11-30T04:09:36  <BenJackson> I often boggle at how it does it
2011-11-30T04:10:37  <sf17k> I'll be trying to win :P

2011-11-30T04:11:51  <a1k0n> the problem with combat in this game is it's complicated definition where you basically have to check each ant against its opponents to determine whether it's dead
2011-11-30T04:12:05  <a1k0n> can't just add stuff up
2011-11-30T04:12:07  <thestinger> I kind of have hardcoded battle plans and then I try variations of them to make them better
2011-11-30T04:12:34  <thestinger> I was worried at speed so I don't really do very much atm
2011-11-30T04:12:44  <thestinger> so it finishes too quickly :)
2011-11-30T04:15:02  <thestinger> ~20-30ms turns with 80 ants in battles
2011-11-30T04:15:59  <sf17k> I figure it's always good to attack if you can trade losses 1:1 or better, because you gain area which means more food
2011-11-30T04:16:11  <BenJackson> only in a 1:1 game
2011-11-30T04:16:22  <BenJackson> in a many player game you and your opponent both get weaker vs everybody
2011-11-30T04:16:31  <sf17k> ah yeah
2011-11-30T04:16:35  <BenJackson> your theory was exactly m y original theory :)
2011-11-30T04:16:38  <thestinger> I tried to take into account the number of enemies but I screwed it up :)
2011-11-30T04:16:39  <sf17k> also I thought it might be less true if there's less food
2011-11-30T04:16:48  <thestinger> _foodfight is just _jedimindtricks with ~100 lines deleted
2011-11-30T04:16:55  <BenJackson> yes, less food is a huge pita
2011-11-30T04:17:03  <BenJackson> I am testing that even now
2011-11-30T04:17:16  <thestinger> some games there's just barely any food :(
2011-11-30T04:17:33  <thestinger> really screws up my bot because my ants end up too far from my hill
2011-11-30T04:17:36  <BenJackson> I've gone beyond the normal low limit for testing
2011-11-30T04:17:41  <thestinger> I rely on a constant food supply for defense

2011-11-30T04:18:23  <sf17k> less ants have to cover more area so they have to move more
2011-11-30T04:18:53  <thestinger> I end up with 10 ants spread around the map looking for food and not finding any
2011-11-30T04:18:58  <sf17k> and maybe try to go around enemies to get to their hills
2011-11-30T04:19:06  <thestinger> and then a pack of 4 ants will take my hill
2011-11-30T04:19:19  <BenJackson> low food games are just extra random
2011-11-30T04:19:23  <BenJackson> like high player count games
2011-11-30T04:20:05  <BenJackson> so I'm working on 6-player low-food right now

2011-11-30T04:21:43  <thestinger> I have types of targets
2011-11-30T04:21:56  <sf17k> food, hills, unvisible squares, enemy fronts
2011-11-30T04:22:11  <thestinger> some I send 1 ant to, some get a few ants, some take any number to satisfy

2011-11-30T04:25:42  <BenJackson> nooo
2011-11-30T04:26:46  <sf17k> haha oh no
2011-11-30T04:27:08  <BenJackson> I had too few ants for attacking to be a priority
2011-11-30T04:27:27  <sf17k> maybe you should just give up your hill and march around attacking other ones
2011-11-30T04:28:20  <thestinger> that's what my old bot did :)
2011-11-30T04:28:47  <thestinger> it works really well on maps with the hills close together

2011-11-30T04:40:05  <thestinger> _next is now _foodfight, and dense/flock will be based on that
2011-11-30T04:41:28  <BenJackson> my aichallenge is t the top of the queue
2011-11-30T04:41:37  <BenJackson> I deactivated so I might upload and get a quick game

2011-11-30T04:44:51  <BenJackson> wow
2011-11-30T04:45:01  <BenJackson> I did a bunch of tuning at food 3/37
2011-11-30T04:45:07  <BenJackson> I ran batches of test games
2011-11-30T04:45:22  <BenJackson> V9 was only keeping its hill for 250 turns in 1/10 games
2011-11-30T04:45:30  <BenJackson> (with all enemies knowing it immediately)
2011-11-30T04:45:57  <BenJackson> improvements got me to 2/10 or 3/10 but also lived much longer and scored a lot more points before losing hills
2011-11-30T04:46:35  <BenJackson> that version tested again at 5/37 (min contest food) won 7, tied 1
2011-11-30T04:47:03  <BenJackson> ahh crap my aichallenge bot played a game anyway

2011-11-30T05:25:17  <thestinger> I dunno how Fluxid managed without using C
2011-11-30T05:25:32  <Surya> yeah, but pathfinding isn't linked to an ant. In my mind it was great to avoid computing again paths
2011-11-30T05:25:33  <BenJackson> my first C++ bot in python would have worked
2011-11-30T05:25:39  <BenJackson> it was much more efficient
2011-11-30T05:25:45  <BenJackson> using the bfs influence maps basically

2011-11-30T05:27:08  <thestinger> s/late/early/ here :)
2011-11-30T05:27:19  <McLeopold> yes, the map is all symmetrical, including hills
2011-11-30T05:28:10  <BenJackson> no way
2011-11-30T05:28:44  <McLeopold> yes, totally :)
2011-11-30T05:29:07  <BenJackson> you're telling me that the orange and the blue hills would be accepted by the food symmetry code?
2011-11-30T05:29:23  <BenJackson> there is nothing on front of the orange hills to resemble what's in front of blue
2011-11-30T05:29:24  <McLeopold> I'm using the food symmetry code to place hills :D
2011-11-30T05:29:28  <BenJackson> nor what's behind
2011-11-30T05:29:44  <BenJackson> place hills based on WHAT HILLS though?
2011-11-30T05:29:56  <BenJackson> I don't doubt there's someplace you could put hills on there
2011-11-30T05:29:56  <McLeopold> ant orientations and offsets
2011-11-30T05:29:58  <BenJackson> just not where you did
2011-11-30T05:30:14  <McLeopold> each ant has 4 hills, not 2
2011-11-30T05:30:23  <BenJackson> oh, fine
2011-11-30T05:30:35  <BenJackson> then it's obviously symmetric :)
2011-11-30T05:30:53  <BenJackson> you could make that more clear by using only 2 colors
2011-11-30T05:31:12  <McLeopold> but it is a 4 player map
2011-11-30T05:31:27  <McLeopold> 16 hills total
2011-11-30T05:31:32  <McLeopold> 4 for each
2011-11-30T05:32:09  <BenJackson> OH

2011-11-30T05:32:37  <BenJackson> I thought that was the map tiling in the viewer

2011-11-30T06:14:39  <thestinger> mleise: yeah
2011-11-30T06:15:33  <mleise> Fluxid: does the server use some sort of Python ➪ machine code compiler?
2011-11-30T06:16:02  <thestinger> pypy is available now and uses a JIT compiler
2011-11-30T06:16:12  <thestinger> but he's somehow getting by with the CPython interpreter
2011-11-30T06:16:48  <mleise> how does the server discriminate between CPython and pypy?
2011-11-30T06:17:03  <thestinger> an extension I guess
2011-11-30T06:17:17  <thestinger> like with C++11 (.cpp uses -std=c++0x)
2011-11-30T06:17:48  <thestinger> http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=1835#p11853 yup
2011-11-30T06:18:00  <thestinger> also it's pypy 1.7 which is the shiny new release
2011-11-30T06:18:18  <thestinger> stackless support enabled by default iirc (lightweight threads and coroutines)
2011-11-30T06:18:32  <thestinger> but I think you give up JIT compilation if you use stackless
2011-11-30T06:18:44  <thestinger> for now
2011-11-30T06:19:19  <mleise> I wonder if I could use this pypy by default on my Linux to run some applets or applications written in Python :D
2011-11-30T06:19:31  <thestinger> yeah, you can
2011-11-30T06:19:38  <mleise> but it's probably not worth the hassle
2011-11-30T06:19:39  <thestinger> it's fully compatible with python2
2011-11-30T06:19:44  <thestinger> no changes needed
2011-11-30T06:19:50  <mleise> 0.0
2011-11-30T06:19:55  <thestinger> the support for c extensions is experimental though
2011-11-30T06:20:02  <thestinger> but most python libs are pure python anyway
2011-11-30T06:20:34  <thestinger> they have 2.7.2 support atm and are raising funds for developing py3 support
2011-11-30T06:20:37  <mleise> how about bindings to xorg or libxml2?
2011-11-30T06:20:52  <mleise> would that fall under the c extension category?

2011-11-30T06:24:01  <thestinger> I just reuploaded so I guess so :P
2011-11-30T06:24:32  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2255 ancient version made it to skill 81.76
2011-11-30T06:24:33  <mleise> Fluxid, yes it says 24
2011-11-30T06:24:38  <thestinger> we'll see how high my new one gets
2011-11-30T06:24:46  <Fluxid> i was 5th for few days with pure python bot, but that was pure luck - many top bots reuploaded at that time. but still felt good
2011-11-30T06:25:13  <thestinger> pypy + ctypes would be nice
2011-11-30T06:25:18  <mleise> Fluxid: so your bot is no longer pure python ?
2011-11-30T06:26:05  <mleise> you are a cheater then :(

2011-11-30T06:27:29  <Fluxid> afair, maybe less python and more C ;)
2011-11-30T06:27:42  <thestinger> that's a lot of code
2011-11-30T06:27:47  <Fluxid> but most logic is still in py
2011-11-30T06:28:04  <thestinger> my bot is 1557 LOC atm
2011-11-30T06:28:10  <Fluxid> cool
2011-11-30T06:28:16  <thestinger> and it's C++ :P
2011-11-30T06:28:18  <mleise> some say it all depends on algorithmic complexity, big-O notation and that you can use any language, as long as you chose the right algorithms. But with all the pretty fixed numbers (map size, time, typical ant and food counts) you really have to look at the overhead of interpreters or garbage collectors.
2011-11-30T06:28:32  <Fluxid> but i have tendencies to unroll long lines into many lines, with one argument per line
2011-11-30T06:28:39  <thestinger> ah
2011-11-30T06:29:03  <thestinger> I've given up at keeping my code pretty with C++
2011-11-30T06:29:17  <mleise> functional programming has the tendency to produce longer lines than imperative programming
2011-11-30T06:29:39  <delt0r> mleise: over of GC is a funny thing... its throughput can be (an in may cases) is faster than C++ new/delete and C malloc
2011-11-30T06:29:40  <Fluxid> i didn't really care about prettiness either, but py code is still better than ugly c code
2011-11-30T06:29:45  <delt0r> overhead
2011-11-30T06:30:23  <thestinger> static SimulateResult simulate(std::vector<std::vector<int>> ant_grid, const std::unordered_map<Location, Direction> &test_orders);
2011-11-30T06:30:27  <thestinger> I have crap like that
2011-11-30T06:30:35  <mleise> delt0r: true, that is. malloc isn't 'realtime' either
2011-11-30T06:30:37  <thestinger> C++ :(
2011-11-30T06:30:46  <mleise> ha ha !
2011-11-30T06:31:21  <thestinger> C++11 type inference with auto helps a lot with line length
2011-11-30T06:31:23  <thestinger> still pretty bad.
2011-11-30T06:32:31  <mleise> static SimulateResult simulate(int[][] ant_grid, const Direction[Location] test_orders) {...}
2011-11-30T06:34:58  <mleise> it is better than, say JavaScript where you don't know the parameter types unless you add a big JSDoc block above the function because it has no declared types.
2011-11-30T06:35:34  <thestinger> type signatures in haskell are so much nicer
2011-11-30T06:35:58  <mleise> thestinger: you could give your template instances other, shorter names. what about haskell?
2011-11-30T06:36:20  <mleise> Doesn't #define or typedef or something work there?
2011-11-30T06:36:52  <thestinger> well, in haskell all the types are inferred for you
2011-11-30T06:36:59  <thestinger> type signatures are optional
2011-11-30T06:37:38  <thestinger> templates in C++ aren't very verbose, but they aren't very informative either
2011-11-30T06:37:54  <thestinger> you have to rely on massive compiler errors because there aren't concepts/type classes
2011-11-30T06:37:54  <mleise> thestinger: I don't know... it seems I would always like to declare my parameter types for documentation purposes.
2011-11-30T06:38:16  <thestinger> mleise: yeah, you usually do
2011-11-30T06:39:00  <mleise> and use "auto x = new SomeClass();"
2011-11-30T06:39:37  <thestinger> haskell has ghci though
2011-11-30T06:39:48  <mleise> never heard of that
2011-11-30T06:40:06  <thestinger> it's just a REPL like irb (ruby) or the interactive python interpreter
2011-11-30T06:40:09  <thestinger> Prelude> :type map
2011-11-30T06:40:11  <thestinger> map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
2011-11-30T06:40:25  *** avdg <avdg!~avdg@78-22-168-200.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-30T06:40:35  <thestinger> Prelude> map (*2) [1..10]
2011-11-30T06:40:37  <thestinger> [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
2011-11-30T06:40:46  <mleise> ok, that is nice to have
2011-11-30T06:41:42  <thestinger> Prelude> let sum xs = foldl (+) 0 xs
2011-11-30T06:41:44  <thestinger> Prelude> :t sum
2011-11-30T06:41:46  <thestinger> sum :: Num b => [b] -> b
2011-11-30T06:41:52  <thestinger> so you can see the type of a function whenever you want
2011-11-30T06:42:58  <thestinger> usually haskell is compiled, ghci is kind of crippled
2011-11-30T06:43:38  <thestinger> I don't think you can define data types in ghci (but you can define them in a file and load it dynamically)
2011-11-30T06:44:48  <mleise> sounds like it would almost be easier to just place some compile time message in your code quickly to print return types
2011-11-30T06:45:05  <thestinger> well you can put the type signature in the code (and usually you do)
2011-11-30T06:45:40  <mleise> i guess for some prototyping it is quite nice to omit them
2011-11-30T06:45:55  <thestinger> it's also nice because your function might be more generic than you thought it was
2011-11-30T06:46:11  <thestinger> and the compiler will infer the most generic type signature
2011-11-30T06:46:30  <thestinger> so a common haskell thing is to write a function, check the type signature and paste it at the top :P
2011-11-30T06:46:34  <mleise> Sure, templated functions can have arbitrary return types
2011-11-30T06:46:51  <thestinger> well, they aren't templates
2011-11-30T06:47:29  <mleise> does that have to do with type classes?
2011-11-30T06:47:36  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T06:47:52  <mleise> so a function takes bytes, ints or doubles and returns double in general?
2011-11-30T06:47:59  <thestinger> well like
2011-11-30T06:48:07  <thestinger> sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
2011-11-30T06:48:12  <thestinger> that's the type signature for sum
2011-11-30T06:48:31  <thestinger> so it takes a list of a type (a) and returns 1 value (of the same type as a)
2011-11-30T06:48:43  <thestinger> and a must be in the Num type class
2011-11-30T06:48:58  <mleise> does Num include types that aren't supported by the machine? like big integers?
2011-11-30T06:49:04  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T06:49:13  <thestinger> and you can make your own type and have it be in that type class
2011-11-30T06:49:46  <thestinger> for example being in the Show type class means something can be turned into a string
2011-11-30T06:49:46  <mleise> wtf? how does the compiler even know how many copies it has to create of that function?
2011-11-30T06:49:56  *** TheLinker <TheLinker!~TheLinker@host59.190-227-155.telecom.net.ar> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-30T06:50:04  <thestinger> dunno
2011-11-30T06:50:15  <thestinger> haskell has a crazy smart compiler though
2011-11-30T06:50:30  <thestinger> it has to deal with laziness vs strictness and stuff other compilers don't have to worry about
2011-11-30T06:50:30  <mleise> I guess I'll stick with the template image though
2011-11-30T06:50:42  <thestinger> well, it works sort of like templates
2011-11-30T06:50:59  <thestinger> but you get sane compile time errors and you can restrict the types allowed to be used
2011-11-30T06:51:52  <mleise> It is like saying "this function takes a parameter T[] and returns T" and then adding some guard conditions like "it has to be byte, int, float, .... or offer the add() method"
2011-11-30T06:52:33  <thestinger> other types are inferred too
2011-11-30T06:52:37  <mleise> This is how it is generally done in D, which lacks type classes.
2011-11-30T06:52:43  <thestinger> Prelude> :t 0
2011-11-30T06:52:45  <thestinger> 0 :: Num a => a
2011-11-30T06:52:50  <thestinger> 0 is just a Num
2011-11-30T06:53:02  <thestinger> Int is a hardware int, Integer is a big integer, etc.
2011-11-30T06:53:30  <mleise> hmm the compiler can say it is a Num, but why isn't it a Show ?! :D
2011-11-30T06:53:39  <thestinger> let i = 0 basically makes a function always returning 0, and you can add a type signature if you want an explicit integer type
2011-11-30T06:54:40  <mleise> if types can belong to multiple classes, then why is there a default for 0 ?
2011-11-30T06:56:49  <thestinger> Nums might just be special, I dunno
2011-11-30T06:56:59  <thestinger> cause it's a literal
2011-11-30T06:57:22  <thestinger> Int and Integer are in the Show type class though
2011-11-30T06:59:57  <thestinger> yeah, I guess numeric literals are just in the Num type class, because that's the only restriction on them
2011-11-30T07:00:03  <thestinger> you could have an unprintable Num type
2011-11-30T07:00:49  <thestinger> like there's a Fractional type class, which is what '5.5' is under before the actual type is inferred
2011-11-30T07:02:52  <mleise> ok, but looking at haskell code really gives me headaches ^^
2011-11-30T07:03:18  <thestinger> the syntax is from math notation mostly instead of previous programming langs
2011-11-30T07:03:27  <mleise> I'm so used to BASIC/Pascal/C like syntaxes.
2011-11-30T07:03:28  <thestinger> pretty much all other languages are just Algol/C :P
2011-11-30T07:04:59  <mleise> i wonder what the next contest could be like. maybe image recognition? "this is a banana" - no stupid bot, it is a pencil
2011-11-30T07:06:28  <mleise> everyone loves strategy games, but isn't there more to A.I.? :)
2011-11-30T07:07:06  <thestinger> it has to be something fun to watch
2011-11-30T07:07:39  <thestinger> well I guess it doesn't _have_ to be, but it's nice if it is
2011-11-30T07:07:44  <mleise> so that excludes anything that just gives an answer

2011-11-30T07:18:17  <mleise> antimatroid: the structure has changed several times, most recently because of some CPU cache measurements i did ^^
2011-11-30T07:18:34  <antimatroid> i'm confused
2011-11-30T07:18:42  <antimatroid> i'm starting to wish i knew more about programming :P
2011-11-30T07:18:52  <antimatroid> not sure if i'll get phd funding so also looking at jobs
2011-11-30T07:19:04  <mleise> basically there are parts of the map that are not considered in path finding unless the start/target is there -> dead ends
2011-11-30T07:19:18  <antimatroid> oh
2011-11-30T07:19:22  <antimatroid> yeah okay, that's a good idea
2011-11-30T07:19:46  <mleise> the dead ends or 'cavities' are 'areas' as well as the rest of the map.
2011-11-30T07:19:58  <mleise> then there are portals
2011-11-30T07:20:09  <antimatroid> portals for known paths?
2011-11-30T07:20:20  <mleise> no
2011-11-30T07:20:27  <antimatroid> that's a nice idea though?

2011-11-30T07:20:49  <mleise> portals delimit 'convex' areas
2011-11-30T07:21:08  <mleise> they can be vertical or horizontal
2011-11-30T07:21:22  <antimatroid> so rectangles?
2011-11-30T07:21:50  <antimatroid> otherwise it's not convex when discrete right?
2011-11-30T07:22:06  <antimatroid> if treated in a continuous sense, i've never really thought about convexity in the discrete case :\
2011-11-30T07:22:16  <mleise> moving towards a portal - like moving to any point - can have 2 options (like right and up). The portals are placed in a way that I can always move without getting blocked, so either up or right works.
2011-11-30T07:22:55  <antimatroid> path finding is pretty fast already if done right
2011-11-30T07:24:13  <mleise> maybe. but the portals reduce the number of queries onto the map
2011-11-30T07:24:58  <mleise> add the dead end elimination to it and pathfinding is no longer something you have to cache or use sparingly.
2011-11-30T07:25:25  <thestinger> BenJackson: your new version doesn't defend?
2011-11-30T07:27:07  <mleise> antimatroid: take a look at this experimental version of multi_hill_maze/maze_02p_02: http://codepad.org/00sViSnL
2011-11-30T07:28:48  <mleise> It suggests that the whole map will consist of ~100 portals rather than several thousand connected squares
2011-11-30T07:30:40  <mleise> This was my L1 cache test: http://codepad.org/pp4FRmn8
2011-11-30T07:31:50  <mleise> It lead to the conclusion that using packed arrays of data vs. pointers to structs/objects (that can be anywhere in memory) is a very big win.
2011-11-30T07:32:42  <thestinger> unless the packed array doesn't fit in cache and the array of pointers does :)
2011-11-30T07:33:11  <p_l> mleise: no shit sherlock
2011-11-30T07:33:26  <mleise> thestinger: the pointers have to hold the data, the packed array would have held. where is the gain?
2011-11-30T07:33:31  <p_l> thestinger: except you pay the price for dereferencing
2011-11-30T07:34:21  <mleise> dereferencing itself (may be a single instruction anyway) and loading from an arbitrary memory location
2011-11-30T07:34:41  <p_l> thestinger: what *can* work better than pure array is a segmented array with individual segments' size tailored for computation & cache line size

2011-11-30T07:54:31  <xyxan> yup i heard that it might be around 18 dec
2011-11-30T07:54:38  <xyxan> but i just wanna confirm?

2011-11-30T08:08:59  <Ruuhkis> Hello guys again! :) Can i make gallup? :D how many times have you COMPLETELY started over with your bots? :)
2011-11-30T08:09:16  <thestinger> once, I switched from python to C++
2011-11-30T08:09:19  <ikaros> 4 or 5 times :)
2011-11-30T08:09:34  <thestinger> I've rewritten most of my bot several times, but that's been incremental
2011-11-30T08:10:06  <Ruuhkis> Just going to start over because wasn't too familiar with this when started this so there's so much to write over that its just better to completely start over :D

2011-11-30T08:11:36  <juststarted> I'm trying to implement a pathfinding algorithm into my bot, but i cant figure out how to get the graph.. anyone got a tip for me ?

2011-11-30T08:14:42  <thestinger> juststarted: you don't really need a graph, just a way to find connected tiles (nodes)
2011-11-30T08:15:23  <thestinger> usually you would do something a hash table with a node as the key and connected nodes (edges) as the value
2011-11-30T08:15:44  <juststarted> Ok, i found this website http://codethissite.blogspot.com/2011/11/ai-challenge-pathfinding.html now and im doing this in java. but if i convert this to java am i going in the right direction :P ?
2011-11-30T08:15:49  <juststarted> trying to implement A*
2011-11-30T08:15:54  <thestinger> but for this you could just use a 2D array since it's a grid, or you could just find the neighbouring nodes as you go
2011-11-30T08:16:47  <thestinger> juststarted: implement BFS first before you consider A*
2011-11-30T08:17:01  <Ruuhkis> juststarted, gl :)
2011-11-30T08:17:22  <thestinger> if you do a BFS from a target and store the distances from every node to that target as you go, you get paths/distances for every tile to the target
2011-11-30T08:17:31  <Ruuhkis> I have couple of questions about BFS, anyone willing to answer?
2011-11-30T08:17:51  <juststarted> Ok and if i have BFS implemented will it be easier to convert that to A* ?
2011-11-30T08:18:06  <thestinger> you could convert it to A* but they're good for different things
2011-11-30T08:18:21  <thestinger> Ruuhkis: sure :)
2011-11-30T08:18:44  <juststarted> Ok, ill look into BFS first :) thanks!

2011-11-30T08:19:13  <thestinger> Ruuhkis: you basically have a first-in first-out queue, and you put 1 or more sources into it
2011-11-30T08:19:50  <Surya> How is c# slower than c++? (considering astar execution)
2011-11-30T08:19:52  <thestinger> then you iterate until the queue is empty, popping a node off the queue and sticking unvisited neighbours of that node onto the queue
2011-11-30T08:20:22  <Ruuhkis> So basically you loop through nodes until you find the target? but what after that?
2011-11-30T08:20:30  <thestinger> there isn't a target
2011-11-30T08:20:35  <Ruuhkis> oh
2011-11-30T08:20:38  <Ruuhkis> thats what i thought!
2011-11-30T08:20:39  <thestinger> BFS traverses the whole graph
2011-11-30T08:20:48  <thestinger> I use it to build distance maps (2d arrays of ints)
2011-11-30T08:20:51  <Ruuhkis> But after I have whole graph "BFSED" what I do?
2011-11-30T08:20:52  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/PNXg
2011-11-30T08:20:55  <juststarted> Oh by the way, is there a place where i can get bot examples from other people? just to get an idea of how other people make their bots?
2011-11-30T08:21:19  <antimatroid> juststarted: we prefer it if people don't share code until after the contest
2011-11-30T08:21:28  <thestinger> Ruuhkis: so then I have distances from every tile to a source, and the shortest paths are implicit
2011-11-30T08:21:29  <antimatroid> that way people know how they go relative to the other people who decided to compete
2011-11-30T08:21:38  <juststarted> ok :) i get that
2011-11-30T08:21:50  <thestinger> Ruuhkis: to send an ant on the shortest path to a target you just need to have it go "downhill" on the distance map
2011-11-30T08:21:54  <antimatroid> we encourage people to share ideas more generally though :)

2011-11-30T08:22:24  <juststarted> it's just im quite new to programming, but maybe this project is a little to high reached for me than ;)
2011-11-30T08:22:24  <Ruuhkis> but you have to generate bfs map for each ant?
2011-11-30T08:22:28  <thestinger> no
2011-11-30T08:22:33  <thestinger> from targets across the map
2011-11-30T08:22:51  <antimatroid> juststarted: it should be a great place for you to have fun while learning
2011-11-30T08:22:55  <thestinger> so lets say you want to send a bunch of ants to attack an enemy hill
2011-11-30T08:23:02  <antimatroid> you might not be able to compete at the top but you can still learn a lot while having fun
2011-11-30T08:23:06  <thestinger> you do a BFS from that hill, marking off the distances in a 2D array
2011-11-30T08:23:18  <antimatroid> juststarted: start by learning how to explore the map and collect food using a breadth first search
2011-11-30T08:23:21  <Ruuhkis> ooh
2011-11-30T08:23:24  <thestinger> then you know how far every ant you have is from that hill, and the shortest path to take them there
2011-11-30T08:23:28  <Ruuhkis> then you can use that map for each ant attacking, right?
2011-11-30T08:23:36  <thestinger> yeah :)
2011-11-30T08:23:45  <juststarted> ok, i'll do that :) thanks again
2011-11-30T08:23:46  <Ruuhkis> but on everyaction you generate new map, right?
2011-11-30T08:23:57  <thestinger> well, you can put multiple sources on one map if you want
2011-11-30T08:24:07  <thestinger> and you don't have to start them off at 0 distance
2011-11-30T08:24:47  <Ruuhkis> about exploring the map, can I use BFS with it? so ants wont get stuck on their way to explore new worlds?
2011-11-30T08:25:09  <thestinger> for exploration, you could just stick all unseen locations onto the search queue
2011-11-30T08:25:15  <thestinger> and then run the BFS which makes a distance map
2011-11-30T08:25:25  <thestinger> and you'll end up with shortest paths to any unexplored location
2011-11-30T08:25:58  <thestinger> there are many ways to do it though
2011-11-30T08:26:37  <Ruuhkis> yeah :P
2011-11-30T08:27:31  <Ruuhkis> thanks for help :3

2011-11-30T08:29:30  <Ruuhkis> You sent that link "http://sprunge.us/PNXg", you have two targets on it, wont the ants mess up when having two targets? :D
2011-11-30T08:29:42  <thestinger> well, the ants just go "down" on the map
2011-11-30T08:30:19  <thestinger> so they can just pick a direction which leads to a tile with a lower value
2011-11-30T08:30:22  <Ruuhkis> the lower number the more likely they will go, right?
2011-11-30T08:30:25  <Ruuhkis> yeah :)
2011-11-30T08:30:51  <Ruuhkis> I am going to try implement this, but I am curious to test python even if I don't like its syntax, but what can you do about it
2011-11-30T08:32:47  <Ruuhkis> that code you sent was written in python, right?
2011-11-30T08:34:02  <thestinger> you mean this? http://sprunge.us/PNXg
2011-11-30T08:34:42  <Ruuhkis> http://codethissite.blogspot.com/2011/11/ai-challenge-pathfinding.html
2011-11-30T08:34:43  <Ruuhkis> this
2011-11-30T08:34:53  <Ruuhkis> oh, you dind't link that
2011-11-30T08:35:00  <Ruuhkis> didn't*
2011-11-30T08:35:07  <thestinger> that's A*, BFS is a lot simpler
2011-11-30T08:35:47  <Ruuhkis> I know, but isn't that python? :3 And the weird thing is, I can perfectly do A* but didn't understand BFS lol
2011-11-30T08:35:56  <Ruuhkis> Maybe because i thought it was much more similar to A*
2011-11-30T08:36:00  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search wikipedia has a good explanation and pseudo-code
2011-11-30T08:36:05  <Ruuhkis> I like A* but i want my code to be QUICK
2011-11-30T08:36:33  <Ruuhkis> mm, wikipedia, my favorite resource, especially for school works!
2011-11-30T08:37:30  <thestinger> A* is usually faster for 1 source -> 1 target but you get much more reusable data out of a single BFS (like distances to a target for all tiles)
2011-11-30T08:37:43  <Ruuhkis> Yeah, that's what i heard :)
2011-11-30T08:38:05  <Ruuhkis> my a* implementation worked.. and "performed" on tutorial map but lets think about map with 100 ants?

2011-11-30T08:38:43  <Ruuhkis> but i could have A* for emergency as its more reliable, isn't it?
2011-11-30T08:38:57  <thestinger> well, you can get shortest paths from both
2011-11-30T08:39:44  <Ruuhkis> yeah, but with BFS i wouldn't have to give each ant id or make they have state which got my code into complete mess
2011-11-30T08:40:01  <Ruuhkis> as I didn't know first the ant objects was recreated for each turn :(

2011-11-30T13:03:34  <avdg> because more maps with less hills were added to the game?
2011-11-30T13:04:10  <thestinger> praveen_: there are a whole bunch of cell mazes, so everything else is diluted :)
2011-11-30T13:04:33  <thestinger> and I don't think the multi hill mazes are on Fluxid's server anymore
2011-11-30T13:04:55  <praveen_> Ya I am looking for multi hill map matches and I could not find any
2011-11-30T13:05:33  <praveen_> Even on aichallenge its very rare, thought whether they have removed that fully - so that we dont need to worry about multi hill at all?
2011-11-30T13:05:47  <Fluxid> are multihill maps still on official server?

2011-11-30T13:39:18  <Fluxid> apart from that second time i run it it segfaults
2011-11-30T13:39:19  <Fluxid> argh
2011-11-30T13:40:33  <thestinger> well, I'm actually measuring the whole run time of a program, not sure how much of that is allocation
2011-11-30T13:41:29  <Fluxid> i tested allocation, it takes as little as nothing
2011-11-30T13:42:17  <Fluxid> at least it is insignifficant as filling takes like 3s
2011-11-30T13:42:29  <Fluxid> i must've screwed something hard again
2011-11-30T13:43:26  <thestinger> well by allocation I meant filling it with -1
2011-11-30T13:43:53  <thestinger> and I think the C++ vector constructor is pretty stupid
2011-11-30T13:43:59  <Fluxid> ah
2011-11-30T13:44:30  <Fluxid> i don't remember how long cleaning took, some 4ms i think
2011-11-30T13:45:25  <Fluxid> so it makes about 15ms in total

2011-11-30T13:58:20  <Fluxid> good
2011-11-30T13:58:36  <Fluxid> i must remember to memset
2011-11-30T14:00:47  <Fluxid> shit takes 3,6s

2011-11-30T14:00:54  <Antimony> wtf
2011-11-30T14:01:00  <Antimony> my new bot is doing badly on the server
2011-11-30T14:01:12  <thestinger> Fluxid: what are you using memset for?
2011-11-30T14:01:38  <Antimony> What am I doing wrong? http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=148212&user=3845
2011-11-30T14:01:49  <Fluxid> thestinger: to zero array of pointers
2011-11-30T14:01:58  <thestinger> are you using C99?
2011-11-30T14:02:04  <Fluxid> yeah
2011-11-30T14:02:14  <thestinger> I think you can just use {} to zero initialize in C99
2011-11-30T14:02:25  <BenJackson> Antimony: wasting moves by moving back and forth
2011-11-30T14:02:27  <thestinger> or {0} (I forget)
2011-11-30T14:02:46  <BenJackson> then attacking Parasprites desipte having few ants

2011-11-30T14:03:32  <thestinger> use calloc then
2011-11-30T14:03:39  <Antimony> hmmm
2011-11-30T14:03:43  <Antimony> I wonder why it's doing so badly
2011-11-30T14:04:16  <Fluxid> arscan: i do height map of many targets at once, and then many ants can move by a gradient descent to the target
2011-11-30T14:04:23  <Antimony> The previous version of my bot was ranked 57th and rising
2011-11-30T14:04:43  <Fluxid> i like the term gradient descent, i learned this thanks to this channel :D
2011-11-30T14:04:46  <BenJackson> Antimony: I think the aichallenge site has a thermocline
2011-11-30T14:05:34  <BenJackson> I don't think the top 250 or so bots would settle the same way if they all got reset
2011-11-30T14:06:26  <thestinger> Fluxid: is this the array you're using for the queue?
2011-11-30T14:06:54  <Antimony> yeah but my old bot was a recent submission
2011-11-30T14:07:01  <Antimony> it worked it's way up over the last week
2011-11-30T14:07:16  <Fluxid> no, i use this array to check if node i check is already in the queue. if it is i pop it from the queue and reuse
2011-11-30T14:07:33  <Fluxid> i mean at given position
2011-11-30T14:08:10  <Fluxid> of course only if this node has been put with larger distance
2011-11-30T14:11:14  <Fluxid> oh wait, simple 1000x1000 takes 56ms not 10ms, 10ms took 200x200, sorry

2011-11-30T14:13:03  <thestinger> mine scales exactly at O(rows * cols)
2011-11-30T14:13:05  <Fluxid> 56ms takes the simplest fifo
2011-11-30T14:13:14  <thestinger> with 1 source?
2011-11-30T14:13:54  <Fluxid> yeah
2011-11-30T14:14:28  <thestinger> what are you using for the queue now?
2011-11-30T14:14:33  <thestinger> like the data structure
2011-11-30T14:14:51  <Fluxid> single linked list with reference to tail
2011-11-30T14:14:57  *** dvladim <dvladim!~dvladim@85.113.131.65> has quit IRC (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
2011-11-30T14:15:13  <Fluxid> for priority double linked with tail
2011-11-30T14:15:22  <Fluxid> because i need pop faster than O(n)
2011-11-30T14:15:30  <Fluxid> i mean any pop from middle
2011-11-30T14:16:00  <thestinger> std::queue uses a std::deque by default, which is a segmented array
2011-11-30T14:16:21  <besh_> fluxid: I think binary heap is the best for priority queues
2011-11-30T14:16:22  <thestinger> a linked list is probably a lot slower because you keep doing allocation
2011-11-30T14:16:44  <Fluxid> besh_: i wanted the simplest approach as start
2011-11-30T14:17:21  <besh_> java has it. Probably c++ stl too.
2011-11-30T14:17:22  <Fluxid> i'll try traversing queue from tail
2011-11-30T14:18:32  <thestinger> Fluxid: using a list makes it take 67ms for 1000x1000 and 269ms for 2000x2000 (compared to 30ms and 120ms with std::queue)
2011-11-30T14:18:43  <thestinger> 'list' is a doubly-linked list though

2011-11-30T14:22:47  <besh_> I understand. Me on the other hand have been doing so much c & fortran, now I find java, c# and all those modern languages exciting.
2011-11-30T14:23:02  <thestinger> java is modern? :P
2011-11-30T14:23:11  <besh_> modern enough for me :)
2011-11-30T14:23:27  <besh_> it has too much library in it.

2011-11-30T14:35:09  <UncleVasya> Maybe it's because my bot isn't smart enough to use an advantage of some of them :)
2011-11-30T14:35:21  <pairofdice> Yeah, I set the interval to check unseen tiles way too low
2011-11-30T14:35:32  <pairofdice> So they oscillate around the hill

2011-11-30T14:51:03  <rwest> oh nvm
2011-11-30T14:51:07  <amstan> is there a way to echo that now?

2011-11-30T14:51:49  <rwest> I must have done a regexp-replace that caught that
2011-11-30T14:51:58  <ikaros> so you choose the highest values no matter how far they are away from your current ants?
2011-11-30T14:52:18  <ikaros> or do you just flood to the invisble area and choose best
2011-11-30T14:52:20  <rwest> ikaros: I use diffusion

2011-11-30T14:52:55  <ikaros> i wasnt so convinced but probably i was doing it wrong lol

2011-11-30T14:53:03  <ikaros> UncleVasya, yea call it influence maps
2011-11-30T14:53:11  <Conorach> I've had a bunch of mixed results.
2011-11-30T14:53:25  <rwest> besh_: let me figure out which one was the latest hah
2011-11-30T14:53:26  <Conorach> you have to add a lot of extra details to make it work well I guess.

2011-11-30T14:54:17  <Fluxid> no
2011-11-30T14:54:24  <ikaros> ok just wondered
2011-11-30T14:54:26  <Fluxid> i think
2011-11-30T14:54:32  <rwest> besh_: rossxwest3, is the newest on fluxid, but it's a lil broken atm
2011-11-30T14:54:38  <rwest> ikaros: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.5063

2011-11-30T14:55:27  <thestinger> 'less -R' if you don't have that aliased already
2011-11-30T14:55:31  <amstan> i tried pasting it in a file then catting it
2011-11-30T14:55:38  <amstan> it wouldn't even show me anything
2011-11-30T14:55:40  <thestinger> -R interprets the color escape codes
2011-11-30T14:55:54  <amstan> oh
2011-11-30T14:55:59  <ikaros> thx rwest you use diffusion for combat too?
2011-11-30T14:56:06  <amstan> thestinger: close.. but not there yet
2011-11-30T14:56:08  <rwest> ikaros: yes
2011-11-30T14:56:14  <thestinger> amstan: newlines are screwed up?
2011-11-30T14:56:39  <besh_> rwest: yeah it seems to do pretty good.
2011-11-30T14:56:41  <Fluxid> i think i screwed up something again, because now the complicated flood takes only 2x more than simple one...

2011-11-30T15:05:03  <amstan> that's because of      ├─gta_sa.exe───7*[{gta_sa.exe}]

2011-11-30T15:09:34  <thestinger> 1 thread per tty or whatever

2011-11-30T15:13:44  <Fluxid> an ant*
2011-11-30T15:13:54  <Fluxid> and i do fill from 10,20
2011-11-30T15:14:43  <thestinger> nice
2011-11-30T15:15:26  <Fluxid> it got faster because i search from tail when looking for a place to put node in priority queue
2011-11-30T15:15:55  <Fluxid> a little less than 100ms on 1000x1000 is nice imo
2011-11-30T15:16:06  <Fluxid> feels good man, now is the time to test it
2011-11-30T15:16:16  <Fluxid> in action
2011-11-30T15:16:19  <thestinger> using a priority queue is a good idea
2011-11-30T15:16:47  <thestinger> there's a drop-in template in the STL so I'll try that later :)
2011-11-30T15:17:32  <Fluxid> thestinger: if you just fill with no speciall effects priority queue is useless, you always get larger distances so you can always put at the end of queue
2011-11-30T15:18:07  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T15:18:28  <thestinger> I do weighting and stuff though
2011-11-30T15:18:38  <Fluxid> :)
2011-11-30T15:18:42  <thestinger> so it has to repaint areas

2011-11-30T15:19:17  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/ORDI?pycon syntax highlighting like pocoo.org :)
2011-11-30T15:19:49  <thestinger> they should put the numbers in a div though
2011-11-30T15:20:17  <Fluxid> yeah, selecting is not nice

2011-11-30T17:11:56  <thestinger> does that old version have any combat?
2011-11-30T17:13:31  <Fluxid> nope
2011-11-30T17:13:33  <Fluxid> ;D
2011-11-30T17:14:31  <Fluxid> it generally sucks, but i've uploaded it after night of coding, on third day of challenge and it got into 20 place anyway, lol
2011-11-30T17:14:45  <pairofdice> Not bad
2011-11-30T17:14:56  <Fluxid> i put all food into flood file there and that's why ants go for food in groups, lol
2011-11-30T17:15:04  <Fluxid> fill*
2011-11-30T17:15:26  <Fluxid> with current one i get strange artifacts when ants enter "=" in the middle
2011-11-30T17:15:33  <Fluxid> the start to dance in place
2011-11-30T17:15:36  <thestinger> you should play on your server again :P
2011-11-30T17:15:52  <Fluxid> nah, it still segfaults
2011-11-30T17:15:57  <thestinger> valgrind
2011-11-30T17:16:01  <Fluxid> somehow it didn't in this game
2011-11-30T17:16:07  <thestinger> hm
2011-11-30T17:16:18  <thestinger> can you run it with valgrind since it's a cpython ext?
2011-11-30T17:16:31  <thestinger> I guess you can run the python interpreter with valgrind?
2011-11-30T17:16:45  <Fluxid> it apparently depends on what i write in python. even i add print after filling it can stop segfaulting...
2011-11-30T17:16:49  <Fluxid> yeah
2011-11-30T17:17:13  <thestinger> gcc also has some neat stuff you can compile with that will do bounds checking etc.
2011-11-30T17:17:14  <Fluxid> i'll try
2011-11-30T17:17:22  <Fluxid> oh?
2011-11-30T17:17:28  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Mudflap_Pointer_Debugging
2011-11-30T17:17:49  <thestinger> clang has some awesome stuff too
2011-11-30T17:18:16  <thestinger> there's clang_analyzer which does static analysis and can find some null pointer dereferences etc.
2011-11-30T17:18:28  <Fluxid> will it work with shared lib?
2011-11-30T17:19:01  <thestinger> I think so
2011-11-30T17:19:26  <thestinger> it just uses an env variable
2011-11-30T17:19:57  <Fluxid> i see

2011-11-30T17:22:18  <thestinger> yeah, -Wextra adds a lot
2011-11-30T17:23:17  <thestinger> -Wall warnings should basically always be fixed, the -Wextra ones are sometimes picky (but easy to silence without turning them off)
2011-11-30T17:23:45  <Fluxid> uh, unused parameters and missing initializer in pythons stuff

2011-11-30T17:24:16  <Fluxid> okay, valgrind then
2011-11-30T17:24:51  <thestinger> make sure to build with -g
2011-11-30T17:24:57  <thestinger> for debugging symbols
2011-11-30T17:25:25  <Fluxid> yup
2011-11-30T17:25:32  <Fluxid> and -O0?
2011-11-30T17:25:34  <thestinger> no
2011-11-30T17:25:36  <thestinger> -O2
2011-11-30T17:26:01  <thestinger> turning off optimization might stop the bug from happening :)
2011-11-30T17:26:04  <Fluxid> gdb whined that some variables were optimized out when tried to print them
2011-11-30T17:26:14  <Fluxid> but ok, let's see
2011-11-30T17:28:35  <thestinger> well, -O0 is probably best for gdb
2011-11-30T17:28:40  <Fluxid> aww, valgrind is whining about function redirection
2011-11-30T17:28:46  <thestinger> but not really for valgrind
2011-11-30T17:28:55  <Fluxid> so i need to recompile glibc?

2011-11-30T17:29:26  <Fluxid> or just disable stripping
2011-11-30T17:29:39  <thestinger> maybe try gdb first
2011-11-30T17:29:47  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/segfault.html that looks like a good tutorial
2011-11-30T17:29:53  <thestinger> I've tried gdb before and it was awful tho
2011-11-30T17:30:17  <Fluxid> i can fix if segfaults in my code
2011-11-30T17:30:42  <Fluxid> but i can't work it out if it crashes in other code because i scribbled over the memory
2011-11-30T17:30:49  <thestinger> oh
2011-11-30T17:31:00  <Fluxid> in this case it crashes after i exit my code
2011-11-30T17:31:01  <Fluxid> :|
2011-11-30T17:31:20  <Fluxid> maybe it is possible with gdb but my brain is too smal for this
2011-11-30T17:31:21  <BenJackson> then yes, you scribbled over memory :)
2011-11-30T17:31:28  <thestinger> libmudflap might be good for finding that
2011-11-30T17:31:39  <Fluxid> how do you say that in english?
2011-11-30T17:31:54  <Fluxid> in polish i heard they use term "scribbling over memory"
2011-11-30T17:32:01  <Fluxid> drawing or something
2011-11-30T17:32:04  <BenJackson> that's how I'd say it in English
2011-11-30T17:32:07  <thestinger> clobbering?
2011-11-30T17:32:16  <BenJackson> scribble implies a reckless disregard
2011-11-30T17:32:40  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-11-30T17:33:03  <thestinger> I'm terrible at using C strings
2011-11-30T17:33:18  <thestinger> so I always have to use valgrind non-stop when I'm using them...
2011-11-30T17:33:33  <thestinger> at least you're not doing that :P
2011-11-30T17:33:41  <BenJackson> dealing with strings in C is terrible
2011-11-30T17:33:53  <BenJackson> that's why some of the worst C (or C++) I've ever seen is in SNMP agents
2011-11-30T17:34:02  <BenJackson> making me twitch just thinking about it
2011-11-30T17:34:17  <thestinger> http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/2/string
2011-11-30T17:34:46  <thestinger> it's a shame the plan9 C stuff didn't make it into ISO C
2011-11-30T17:34:51  <thestinger> lots of it is pretty nice
2011-11-30T17:35:05  <thestinger> like UTF-8 ofc, which was made for plan9
2011-11-30T17:35:07  <Fluxid> i'll try mudflap but also recompile glibc and python with ggdb and nostrip
2011-11-30T17:35:14  <Fluxid> <3 gentoo
2011-11-30T17:35:31  <BenJackson> if you're crashing inside glibc the bug is probably in your code
2011-11-30T17:35:40  <BenJackson> and knowing where it crashes in glibc probably won't help you
2011-11-30T17:35:50  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-11-30T17:35:55  <BenJackson> usually in that case knowing WHEN it happens is more useful
2011-11-30T17:35:59  <BenJackson> because it's likely you just did it
2011-11-30T17:36:02  <Fluxid> but valgrind whines about glibc
2011-11-30T17:36:08  <BenJackson> if there's some glibc call (eg print) that crashes, start calling it from everywhere
2011-11-30T17:36:12  <BenJackson> to narrow it down
2011-11-30T17:36:23  <Fluxid> ah
2011-11-30T17:37:07  <BenJackson> given that you wrote a relatively small amount of C code and integrated with Python I'd guess it's more likely that you are managing your own small amount of memory properly
2011-11-30T17:37:17  <BenJackson> but you're messing up the python refs and causing python to step on something
2011-11-30T17:38:00  <Fluxid> i'll see

2011-11-30T17:39:48  <thestinger> I think so

2011-11-30T18:10:22  <Fluxid> sigsegv is uncatchable :(
2011-11-30T18:10:30  <BenJackson> it's totally catchable
2011-11-30T18:10:37  <Fluxid> seriously?
2011-11-30T18:10:52  <BenJackson> yes, but you can't *ignore* it
2011-11-30T18:10:57  <Fluxid> ah!
2011-11-30T18:11:03  <BenJackson> so what are you going to do in the handler is the question
2011-11-30T18:11:22  <Fluxid> can i do a longjump?
2011-11-30T18:11:25  <BenJackson> yes
2011-11-30T18:11:29  <Fluxid> just to make things worse
2011-11-30T18:11:57  <BenJackson> fixing your bug is probably better
2011-11-30T18:12:02  <Fluxid> but when i do a longjump then it's like i ignored it, right?
2011-11-30T18:12:15  <BenJackson> what I mean is that SIG_IGN won't ignore segv
2011-11-30T18:12:22  <Fluxid> ok
2011-11-30T18:12:37  <BenJackson> it will act like SIG_DFL
2011-11-30T18:12:45  <BenJackson> but if you catch it you can longjmp
2011-11-30T18:12:50  <thestinger> Fluxid: separate out all your C code and use ctypes :P
2011-11-30T18:13:04  <BenJackson> it's like MMU fault handling:
2011-11-30T18:13:11  <BenJackson> when you return from SEGV the instruction that faulted will restart
2011-11-30T18:13:17  <BenJackson> if it still faults it will SEGV again
2011-11-30T18:13:36  <BenJackson> but if you longjmp that will change pc and that instruction won't matter
2011-11-30T18:13:42  <Fluxid> thestinger: how will it work, when my own almost-pure-c code is buggy... it will still scribble over memory ;P
2011-11-30T18:13:56  <thestinger> if it's pure C you'll actually be able to debug it
2011-11-30T18:14:16  <BenJackson> I would just use C++
2011-11-30T18:14:19  <BenJackson> wait I *did* just use C++
2011-11-30T18:14:29  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T18:14:56  <BenJackson> with STL types the high level C++ that would replace your python isn't that much worse than python
2011-11-30T18:16:03  <Fluxid> BenJackson: it's like learning new language, i don't want to play with c++ and its libraries now

2011-11-30T18:16:59  <BenJackson> what's the symptom again?  I came in late
2011-11-30T18:17:04  <thestinger> libmudflap will definitely find the problem if you can separate out the C code into a program
2011-11-30T18:17:08  <thestinger> BenJackson: segfault
2011-11-30T18:17:13  <BenJackson> you invoke your C extension a bunch and then your program crashes NOT in your extension?
2011-11-30T18:17:33  <Fluxid> yeah
2011-11-30T18:17:52  <BenJackson> and you're sure of your python value ref/deref?
2011-11-30T18:18:20  <BenJackson> I guess one trick (if you can repro) is to take out all deref and accept the memory leak
2011-11-30T18:18:31  <BenJackson> if it doesn't crash then start putting them back
2011-11-30T18:18:48  <BenJackson> else make sure all your malloc/free are balanced and your mallocs are big enough
2011-11-30T18:18:50  <thestinger> the problem is that his program doesn't always crash

2011-11-30T18:19:11  <thestinger> worst kind of bug ever

2011-11-30T18:31:59  <thestinger> they're just features I haven't discovered yet
2011-11-30T18:32:09  <BenJackson> what I'm really optimizing is the process of not taking random losses in the first few games

2011-11-30T18:47:17  <Surya> But I really want to have a good exploration system before implementing attack moves
2011-11-30T18:47:22  <Surya> And I can't make it right
2011-11-30T18:47:56  <Surya> So far I'm sending my ants where the visibility is low

2011-11-30T18:48:20  <Surya> But I enconter patterns, and my ants start doing cycles

2011-11-30T18:52:32  <Surya> No pb, ur right, I got to fix that.
2011-11-30T18:52:46  <Surya> Hum, I assume some people tried my strategy
2011-11-30T18:53:03  <Surya> So maybe 4 people will come and say "hey it sucks because blablabla"
2011-11-30T18:53:04  <ikaros> you need to explain more accurately
2011-11-30T18:53:08  <ikaros> what you are doing
2011-11-30T18:53:10  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-30T18:53:31  <ikaros> what means "where visibility is low"
2011-11-30T18:53:55  <Surya> Ok, every turn I create a "visibility map". Every tile contains a "score" which is how many ants see it
2011-11-30T18:54:09  <Surya> When I have done all the food/attacking hills order
2011-11-30T18:54:16  <Surya> I go into the exploration part
2011-11-30T18:54:54  <Surya> For every ant, I check on 8 different position( North -north/east - east ...)
2011-11-30T18:55:19  <Surya> X tiles from my ant, and I send it to the less visible spot
2011-11-30T18:55:38  <Surya> The problem is that I encounter cycles
2011-11-30T18:55:44  <ikaros> they probably jitter?
2011-11-30T18:55:46  <Surya> because of all the water
2011-11-30T18:56:24  <Surya> Yeah, the jitter exactly
2011-11-30T18:56:27  <Surya> they*
2011-11-30T18:56:58  <ikaros> instead of only looking at the neighborhood8 you could try to search in a larger radius or flood until you find invisible area
2011-11-30T18:57:19  <ikaros> but i think only searching the direct neighborhood is bad if there are many ants around
2011-11-30T18:57:34  <Surya> I look the radius + 1 so far
2011-11-30T18:57:42  <ikaros> oh ok
2011-11-30T18:57:54  <Surya> and if I encounter a water, I check an available spot around it
2011-11-30T18:57:56  <Surya> but still
2011-11-30T18:58:00  <Surya> my ants jitter
2011-11-30T18:58:08  <Surya> and can't really explore properly
2011-11-30T18:58:09  <ikaros> you only consider invisible tiles or visibles too?
2011-11-30T18:58:25  <Surya> visibles as "earth"
2011-11-30T18:58:39  <Surya> visible + invisible
2011-11-30T18:59:19  <Surya> (I answered too quickly, I consider both: if it's invisible I say it's not a water Tile)

2011-11-30T19:00:31  <ikaros> what you can do is increase all tiles you see each turn by one and then do a bfs search from all invisble tiles to your ants or vice versa.. depending on how you have everything set up
2011-11-30T19:01:05  <Surya> I'm using only Astar so far
2011-11-30T19:01:46  <Surya> (thank you for being interested btw :))

2011-11-30T19:06:01  <Surya> besh: Without spoling too much, towards which solution did you go? Something similar or you just erased everything and built up a whole new system?
2011-11-30T19:06:55  <besh> Ok what i tried was to keep the number of visits of each square.
2011-11-30T19:07:18  <besh> Then send my ants to the least visited square (visible or not)
2011-11-30T19:07:57  <besh> getNearestLeastVistiedTileAtViewRadiusPlusOne
2011-11-30T19:08:29  <besh> but in one turn many ants move to same square and they did not distriubute that well

2011-11-30T19:30:14  <pairofdice> That description makes it sound like magic is happening. The Pacman is just sending a hill for the ghosts to climb and the ghosts are sending an anti-hill
2011-11-30T19:30:41  <pairofdice> The diffusion is basically a BFS, it just average the surrounding tiles
2011-11-30T19:31:03  <pairofdice> So it takes a few iterations for it to spread

2011-11-30T19:31:39  <besh> yes I understnad that but it says the 5 ghosts go 5 different ways to nail down the pacman
2011-11-30T19:31:55  <pairofdice> Yeah, that's the anti-hill part
2011-11-30T19:32:00  <besh> I would expect , with A* f.i, there would only be one optimal path (the middle one problably)
2011-11-30T19:32:13  <pairofdice> It's not A*
2011-11-30T19:32:51  <besh> yes, so what is so different that introduces this collaborative phenomenon. That is what i miss.
2011-11-30T19:32:55  <pairofdice> The ghosts repel each other
2011-11-30T19:32:57  <ThiagoRRamos> pairofdice: What do you mean by average?
2011-11-30T19:33:54  <pairofdice> I mean, the values of the tiles is 0.2 * (tiles surrounding it) or something
2011-11-30T19:33:55  <besh> With a simple diffusion scheme (bfs) there is one path. How do they repel ? Is there an extra step
2011-11-30T19:34:22  <pairofdice> BFS is not diffusion
2011-11-30T19:34:58  <pairofdice> The Pacman has a value of let's say 1000 that gets diffused over the map
2011-11-30T19:35:00  <ThiagoRRamos> pairdfdice: Hmm, I see. then I made it different :P
2011-11-30T19:35:20  <pairofdice> The ghosts have a value of -200 that gets diffused
2011-11-30T19:35:54  <pairofdice> Or something pretty similar
2011-11-30T19:35:59  <Minthos> Next game should be within 1333 minutes.
2011-11-30T19:36:02  <Minthos> yaaaay..
2011-11-30T19:37:37  <besh> If only the pacman diffuses its value then it would be bfs (i.e with many iterations). Does the diffusion values from the ghosts and pacman add up or something ?
2011-11-30T19:37:38  <Minthos> oh well, time to get some sleep
2011-11-30T19:37:52  <ikaros> besh, the ghosts block the scent
2011-11-30T19:38:09  <ikaros> so behind the there is nothing to propagate further

2011-11-30T19:39:33  <ikaros> could be like pairofdice said.. that you just have an anti value to decrease the scent but not totally kill it
2011-11-30T19:39:33  <besh> Oh so they bring down the gradient ?
2011-11-30T19:39:41  <pairofdice> Yea

2011-11-30T19:40:24  <pairofdice> But if you completely block it then if you have ants in a corridor...
2011-11-30T19:40:38  <ikaros> and im wondering if i could replace all diffusion steps by one large bfs
2011-11-30T19:41:04  <ikaros> would be more accurate and probably even faster

2011-11-30T21:28:50  <avdg> its at least 1000 times faster than my js implementation atm
2011-11-30T21:29:28  <avdg> and at almost no memory
2011-11-30T21:29:29  <pairofdice> ChrisH, yeah, your bot seems to have trouble with time on the official server
2011-11-30T21:30:52  * antimatroid looks forward to seeing what information people have calculated to make use of
2011-11-30T21:30:59  <ChrisH_> pairofdice: that depends on how you look at it.  It a late game scenario with lots of combat and lots of ants there is a lot of work to do, so my bot will do the most important work first.
2011-11-30T21:31:10  <ChrisH_> but I'm sure it could be faster.
2011-11-30T21:31:11  <antimatroid> i've found a bunch of neat little tricks to get some information which i've kept private and i imagine others have done the same
2011-11-30T21:31:41  <bugnuts> ChrisH_ is that why you sit on your hills in the end game e.g. http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=145336&user=10
2011-11-30T21:31:48  <ChrisH_> still, my current code is several orders of magnitude faster than when I started, which just means I can put more features in.
2011-11-30T21:31:49  <antimatroid> i've got some fairly complicated searching things going on too
2011-11-30T21:32:20  <ChrisH_> bugnuts: not entirely, I also stop moving ants near the end of the game if their target is too far away to get there in the remaining turns.
2011-11-30T21:32:25  * avdg has 1 goto he can't get rid of :/
2011-11-30T21:33:06  <avdg> at least in a clean way
2011-11-30T21:33:28  <ChrisH_> bugnuts: so on a map like that an ant on a hill far from the action knows it can't make it there in the last few turns, so what's the point.

2011-11-30T21:33:30  <bugnuts> yeah although in that game the nearest hill is 84 steps from yours but you stop about 98 turns before the end
2011-11-30T21:33:49  <pairofdice> Ahh, that explains it
2011-11-30T21:35:11  <ChrisH_> bugnuts: which hills?
2011-11-30T21:35:34  <bugnuts> 73,11 to 73,90

2011-11-30T21:39:12  <ChrisH_> bugnuts: well, looking at that game more carefully I think it is probably time constrained, lots of long paths to compute and combat and a moderate ant count.
2011-11-30T21:39:40  <ChrisH_> the good news (IMHO) is that my code handled it gracefully without timing out like it used to :)

2011-11-30T21:40:35  <avdg> ChrisH_: which language are you using?
2011-11-30T21:40:41  <antimatroid> go
2011-11-30T21:41:56  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: it kinda looked like it, didn't it, then I lost to xathis in a 1-on-1 game, but part of the reason for that loss was a known bug in my combat code (which I'm fixing tonight), even so, I don't know if I would have won without that bug, maybe pulled off a draw though
2011-11-30T21:42:40  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: i'm curious about what people are doing outside of combat
2011-11-30T21:42:54  <antimatroid> ie. are you willing to share what you do generally for food collection?
2011-11-30T21:43:43  <antimatroid> i iteratively collect non-collected food with an a* search from all movable ants to all uncollected food, then if an ant can't possibly land in a battle with an enemy on it's path I'll even reuse it next to it's collected food item and just note when it'll be available to move
2011-11-30T21:43:50  <ChrisH_> sure, in fact you can read the IRC logs from a few weeks ago where I was discussing my path finding ideas here.
2011-11-30T21:43:59  <antimatroid> reading irc logs sucks :P

2011-11-30T21:44:21  <avdg> searching is a bit better than reading ;-)
2011-11-30T21:44:37  <antimatroid> but you have to both search and then read then :P
2011-11-30T21:44:57  <ChrisH_> at the time I had a nicely working multi-source BFS technique and was trying out A* to see how it would compare and was a bit surprised to learn that A* was slower.
2011-11-30T21:45:17  <antimatroid> what?
2011-11-30T21:45:19  <ChrisH_> so I was sharing that surprise here
2011-11-30T21:45:32  <avdg> I wonder how a modified A* would do
2011-11-30T21:45:42  <antimatroid> any details on that?
2011-11-30T21:45:47  <McLeopold> A* should just be a directed bfs
2011-11-30T21:45:47  <antimatroid> i've found it faster when collecting food
2011-11-30T21:45:59  <ChrisH_> yeah, it turned out that my heuristic function cost exceeded the saving due to fewer neighbor expansions.
2011-11-30T21:46:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold: my heuristic function with multiple targets leaves me a bit iffy
2011-11-30T21:46:07  <McLeopold> so the F calc was taking more time than searching extra nodes?
2011-11-30T21:46:18  <ChrisH_> yep
2011-11-30T21:46:25  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: was this with multi target or single target?
2011-11-30T21:46:40  <ChrisH_> multi source BFS looking for multi target
2011-11-30T21:46:46  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I need a fast nearest neighbors query
2011-11-30T21:46:52  <antimatroid> i wont use multi target a* with lots of targets, but i'm still convinced it's worth it for food collection
2011-11-30T21:47:11  <ChrisH_> depends how you collect food i guess
2011-11-30T21:47:24  <antimatroid> will you send more than one ant to the same food item?
2011-11-30T21:47:35  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/cell_maze.py#L309
2011-11-30T21:47:39  <ChrisH_> I throw all the food, enemy hills, exploration points and anything else I'm looking for into the same search
2011-11-30T21:47:48  <antimatroid> oh
2011-11-30T21:47:54  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm checking distances to every point, not just the closest
2011-11-30T21:47:55  <antimatroid> then just bfs from the targets and move an ant as you come across it?
2011-11-30T21:48:02  *** jstrong is now known as roflmao
2011-11-30T21:48:03  <antimatroid> that's my really fast just move all the ants at the end code
2011-11-30T21:48:57  <antimatroid> i find doing that from the targets is better otherwise you really want to order your ants based on their closest target to move them surely? otherwise collision avoidance would be a pita
2011-11-30T21:49:26  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what about a bfs from all targets to get closest target information across the board?
2011-11-30T21:49:27  <ChrisH_> then I bfs to the first ant, record the match, and do some tricks to erase the expanded nodes for that source and restart my BFS to get the next match, repeat until either sources or targets are exhausted

2011-11-30T21:50:01  <antimatroid> ahhh, i think i implemented something like that
2011-11-30T21:50:29  <antimatroid> when you move an ant you stop using their search nodes and add in new search nodes for any ants that can move into the positions that moved ant searched into first move?
2011-11-30T21:50:49  <antimatroid> i didn't like that :P
2011-11-30T21:50:52  <antimatroid> if that's what you mean
2011-11-30T21:50:52  <ChrisH_> and the other trick is that I remember where ants will be in the future so they can satisfy multiple nearby targets, and i don't send three ants for food when one will due
2011-11-30T21:51:01  <antimatroid> yeah i do that
2011-11-30T21:51:36  <ChrisH_> not sure what you mean by "stop using their search nodes"
2011-11-30T21:52:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I just need eulidian distance, not path distance
2011-11-30T21:52:25  <antimatroid> say you remove a source, then you don't want to use any search items you pull of the queue that were from that ant
2011-11-30T21:52:32  <antimatroid> if you want to continue using hte same search queue
2011-11-30T21:53:02  <antimatroid> McLeopold: shouldn't that be reasonably fast?
2011-11-30T21:53:45  <ChrisH_> oh, yeah, I remove them from the queue and also erase the data about completed nodes from the map so a more distant target can refill that area.
2011-11-30T21:55:22  <ChrisH_> also, I'm not using just a BFS, but it's really a Djikstra's because I use node traversal costs to control some behaviors
2011-11-30T21:58:33  <ChrisH_> plus there is the idea that a target may need more than one ant to go there to satisfy the current strategy
2011-11-30T21:58:50  <ChrisH_> and several other customizations
2011-11-30T22:00:00  <antimatroid> when moving towards ants do you just sent an ant to where they are now? or where you think they might be in the future?
2011-11-30T22:00:01  <ChrisH_> but when I tried A* I found that computing the board wrapped Manhattan distance at every step of the search was just too costly
2011-11-30T22:00:09  <antimatroid> send*
2011-11-30T22:00:19  <ChrisH_> you mean towards enemy ants?
2011-11-30T22:00:23  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-30T22:00:56  <antimatroid> that's a big hint towards one of the best parts of my bot :P
2011-11-30T22:01:28  <ChrisH_> I don't want to give away too much, because that was the big improvement that got me to the top 10, but I will say that I assume they are headed towards my nearest hill
2011-11-30T22:02:21  <ChrisH_> and if not, that's ok, the hills are what's important, right

2011-11-30T22:04:40  <antimatroid> i know, but i doubt everyone has implemented it
2011-11-30T22:04:46  <ChrisH_> true
2011-11-30T22:05:01  <ChrisH_> or done it well
2011-11-30T22:05:18  <antimatroid> yeah i worked out how to do it better than i previously was last night
2011-11-30T22:05:27  <ChrisH_> good

2011-11-30T23:22:57  <thestinger> lol, C++
2011-11-30T23:23:44  <thestinger> maybe I should just give up on 80 col long lines
2011-11-30T23:24:53  <BenJackson> I did by accident
2011-11-30T23:25:02  <BenJackson> I happened to start workign on this challenge in a wide window
2011-11-30T23:25:05  <BenJackson> now I'm too lazy to fix it
2011-11-30T23:26:32  <antimatroid> thestinger: 80 cols is not enough
2011-11-30T23:26:49  <antimatroid> some of my lines end up on two and i have a 24" wide screen monitor :P
2011-11-30T23:26:55  <BenJackson> anyone else playing skyrim?  because Lydia is a fucking tool

2011-11-30T23:28:31  <rohant> what's up with the servers??
2011-11-30T23:28:32  <thestinger> I have like 5 of those function calls in a row
2011-11-30T23:28:39  <thestinger> do not want to break them onto multiple lines :P
2011-11-30T23:29:43  <antimatroid> thestinger: why are you doing grid[loc.row][loc.col]? overload [] for Location!
2011-11-30T23:30:13  <BenJackson> neat
2011-11-30T23:33:26  <BenJackson> I didn't realize it did closures like that
2011-11-30T23:34:11  <BenJackson> antimatroid: the stock grid is a vector<vector<>>
2011-11-30T23:34:21  <BenJackson> I did override it because I made a custom grid

2011-11-30T23:34:33  <thestinger> antimatroid: that's not an overload
2011-11-30T23:34:37  <thestinger> it's a lambda
2011-11-30T23:34:54  <BenJackson> he meant grid[loc]
2011-11-30T23:34:58  <antimatroid> BenJackson: i wrote the c++ bot, i know, but that was to keep it simple for people :P
2011-11-30T23:35:11  <BenJackson> good to know, I'll quit badmouthing it ;-)

2011-11-30T23:35:58  <antimatroid> grid[loc].stuff is way better that grid[loc.row][loc.col].stuff
2011-11-30T23:36:03  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-30T23:36:57  <thestinger> BenJackson: lambdas actually mix really well with the other stuff in C++
2011-11-30T23:37:29  <rohantt> anyone knows why the servers died all of a sudden?
2011-11-30T23:38:00  <thestinger> letting them capture references is awesome
2011-11-30T23:38:56  <yoden> if you capture a shared_ptr with a lambda, does that increase the ref count of the ptr?
2011-11-30T23:40:33  <thestinger> not sure, I'm not actually returning functions anywhere though
2011-11-30T23:42:00  <yoden> i have a ridiculous queue of pauseable functions
2011-11-30T23:42:17  <yoden> because i'm trying to cache things at the start when there's lots of free CPU
2011-11-30T23:42:19  <yoden> :(
2011-11-30T23:42:31  <BenJackson> I considered that
2011-11-30T23:42:36  <BenJackson> but I wasn't sure what I'd... pre-do
2011-11-30T23:42:55  <yoden> i'm just caching ordered radial lists for each square
2011-11-30T23:43:05  <yoden> so i can ask for "what can see here" or "what can attack here"
2011-11-30T23:43:33  <yoden> it's not usually a too slow, unless ec2 is being slower than usual
2011-11-30T23:43:41  <yoden> which is like 15% of the time I guess

2011-11-30T23:48:07  <Falcon256> Okay, thanks.
2011-11-30T23:48:11  <BenJackson> well it's not entirely abnormal
2011-11-30T23:48:17  <BenJackson> just much worse than usual
2011-11-30T23:48:31  <yoden> well, because the main server is lagged out like every other day :P
2011-11-30T23:48:40  <yoden> TCP servers much better for testing

2011-11-30T23:56:40  <yoden> the main downside to fluxid is that everyone on there is super pro :(
2011-11-30T23:56:43  <BenJackson> there's another one if you find that level of competition too high to learn from
2011-11-30T23:57:42  <Falcon256> well, I would rather die badly then watch ants run over eachother.. we will see how it goes.
2011-11-30T23:59:38  <Kommander> why is the list for dead ants in the python package using defaultdict?
