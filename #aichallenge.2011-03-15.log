2011-03-15T17:12:29  <janzert> 10,000 is probably a safe number. I think we ran into problems at 32,768 before

2011-03-15T17:27:09  <Frontier> Should you manage to store replays as files on the same machine that runs the web server, please let me know. It's no big deal then to  change the visualizer.php into a static html file and download the replay through JavaScript
2011-03-15T17:28:50  <janzert> Frontier: what if the visualizer html and js came from a separate subdomain, could the visualizer be completely static html then as well?
2011-03-15T17:29:08  <janzert> or is some information still needed dynamically from the database?
2011-03-15T17:29:55  <janzert> that is probably phrased rather badly, in regards to the subdomain
2011-03-15T17:30:12  <Frontier> janzert: I'm not 100% sure about sub-domains, but every detail the visualizer needs can be stored in the replay file.
2011-03-15T17:30:35  <janzert> I mean the visualizer and replays are served from a common subdomain of ai-contest.com
2011-03-15T17:30:43  <janzert> say replay.ai-contest.com or some such
2011-03-15T17:31:20  <janzert> hmm, and js could use say a #! anchor to download the correct replay I suppose?
2011-03-15T17:36:44  <Frontier> janzert: It looks like XmlHttpRequests work only on the exact same hostname. If both the html and the replays are on replay.ai-contest.com that works. An anchor is one possibility, although I currently use the anchor to center the visualizer. ;-) The current scheme which uses a parameter (?game_id=xyz) is working here, too. The script can parse the adress and get the information.

2011-03-15T17:43:07  <janzert> I could set it back up but it would take a couple hours for the dns changes to propagate again

2011-03-15T19:03:02  <McLeopold1> janzert: what do you think about older submission getting less games?
2011-03-15T19:05:27  <janzert> I have mixed feelings about it but in any case I don't think jeff would ever go for it
2011-03-15T19:05:38  <janzert> I could be surprised though
2011-03-15T19:06:20  <McLeopold1> well, with truescore, old submissions should stabalize
2011-03-15T19:06:25  <McLeopold1> trueskill
2011-03-15T19:07:11  <janzert> if there the servers were to stay up after the finals I think it should be done for sure at that point
2011-03-15T19:07:21  <McLeopold1> My thought is that a submission gets to be a seed if the sigma is above a certain value
2011-03-15T19:07:54  <McLeopold1> When a submission is submitted, all submissions get an increase in sigma
2011-03-15T19:08:12  <McLeopold1> so, if enough are submitted, then even old submissions will be seeded again
2011-03-15T19:08:27  <McLeopold1> but if not, then they only get games when chosen to sort out the new submissions
2011-03-15T19:09:29  <janzert> that might work fine, I'm not sure all the side effects are immediately apparent though
2011-03-15T19:09:48  <McLeopold1> resubmitting the same thing to get more games
2011-03-15T19:10:00  * janzert nods
2011-03-15T19:10:08  <McLeopold1> but we could check the submission hash

2011-03-15T19:10:58  <janzert> what hack is that?
2011-03-15T19:10:59  <McLeopold1> If we gear the system to give them a few game right away on a new submit, we may prevent that from happening as much.
2011-03-15T19:11:24  <McLeopold1> uh, hack as in gaming the system
2011-03-15T19:11:45  <janzert> oh resubmitting constantly
2011-03-15T19:11:48  <McLeopold1> yeah
2011-03-15T19:12:13  <janzert> wouldn't giving more games to a new resubmit encourage it more?
2011-03-15T19:12:30  <McLeopold1> I'm thinking it would be the opposite
2011-03-15T19:12:39  <McLeopold1> Why would someone want more games?
2011-03-15T19:13:00  <janzert> so they can see their submission play more games

2011-03-15T19:14:20  <McLeopold1> Well, this is more turning off old submission.
2011-03-15T19:14:22  <janzert> I don't understand how more games would ever be something people wouldn't want
2011-03-15T19:14:42  <janzert> right, so long as it takes a reasonable time to kick in
2011-03-15T19:14:47  <McLeopold1> So, if everyone resubmits constantly, we are back to normal.
2011-03-15T19:15:03  *** Frontier <Frontier!~marco@dslb-088-070-132-011.pools.arcor-ip.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-15T19:15:05  <janzert> before it kicks in just be sure to rotate through the players
2011-03-15T19:15:34  <McLeopold1> rotate how?
2011-03-15T19:15:37  <janzert> and I wouldn't mind seeing it but I still have a feeling jeff will be opposed
2011-03-15T19:16:08  <janzert> always choose the seed to be the player least recently used as a seed
2011-03-15T19:16:39  <McLeopold1> What I'm suggesting is to stop using old submissions as a seed, but still allow it to be matched.
2011-03-15T19:16:51  * janzert nods
2011-03-15T19:17:19  <McLeopold1> Okay, the userid, id still gets chosen, but they don't have a new submissions, so they get passed.
2011-03-15T19:17:52  <janzert> right, only use the userids that have a submission that is eligible
2011-03-15T19:19:08  <janzert> I think I'd just leave it out for now though and then after the contest has run for a few weeks check what the sigma is for submissions that are still active and were submitted at the beginning
2011-03-15T19:19:27  <janzert> then use that as the cutoff

2011-03-15T19:45:43  <bss03> I'm pretty sure the choose the seed based on the person who played a game least recently.
2011-03-15T19:46:08  <bss03> So, that should roughly equalize the games, even when truskill just wants to play the middle of the field over and over.
2011-03-15T19:46:49  <bss03> Plus, I'm not sure we'll ever reduce to "just" trueskill.  That doesn't happen until the graph is fully connected.

2011-03-15T19:53:24  <janzert> McLeopold was proposing to change it so old submissions would never be chosen as the seed
2011-03-15T19:55:15  <McLeopold1> janzert: do you know php?
2011-03-15T19:55:53  <janzert> not proficiently
2011-03-15T19:56:08  <janzert> enough to read and stumble through writing it though
2011-03-15T19:56:20  <McLeopold1> I'm struggling with the dumbest thing.  I can't get a php page to write a file.
2011-03-15T19:57:09  <McLeopold1> I can't tell if it's windows, apache or php that's got the safety on.
2011-03-15T19:57:36  <janzert> I guess I can't remember ever directly writing to a file from php myself
2011-03-15T19:58:00  <McLeopold1> I want to take the posted game result and create a replay file.
2011-03-15T19:58:12  * janzert nods
2011-03-15T19:58:34  <janzert> hmm, actually I guess the old code should have done that as well
2011-03-15T19:58:43  <McLeopold1> it put it in the database
2011-03-15T19:58:52  <McLeopold1> so, no permission issues there
2011-03-15T19:58:54  <janzert> oh yeah :}
2011-03-15T19:59:04  <McLeopold1> but here's the kicker, I can create a directory
2011-03-15T19:59:10  <McLeopold1> just not a file
2011-03-15T19:59:46  <janzert> just as a double check, you're opening the file in a write mode correct?
2011-03-15T20:00:16  <janzert> e.g. fopen(filename, "w")
2011-03-15T20:00:52  <McLeopold1> yea
2011-03-15T20:01:06  <McLeopold1> And I've tried relative and absolute as well.
2011-03-15T20:01:19  <McLeopold1> I'm doing absolute for the mkdir() call, which works.
2011-03-15T20:02:13  <janzert> hmm, I see in safe mode the directory must have the same owner as the script being executed
2011-03-15T20:02:21  <janzert> not sure how that works out on windows though
2011-03-15T20:02:41  <janzert> maybe try disabling safe mode once just to see
2011-03-15T20:03:10  <janzert> hmm, I see safe mode is actually deprecated now
2011-03-15T20:04:14  <McLeopold1> yeah, and I don't think it is on...
2011-03-15T20:05:01  <janzert> do you get any error or the file just doesn't get written?

2011-03-15T21:24:17  <amstan> bss03: so i changed the links from epsilon-new-schema
2011-03-15T21:24:24  <amstan> bss03: ok.. in that case
2011-03-15T21:24:55  <bss03> I can cerntainly do that (match an interface) though.  The SQL is useable right now, just not ideal.
2011-03-15T21:26:26  <amstan> bss03: well.. there's a file from elo, that should be replaced with your stuff
2011-03-15T21:27:18  <bss03> create_matchups.py?
2011-03-15T21:27:28  <amstan> bss03: yes
2011-03-15T21:29:09  <bss03> I'm not exactly sure I can match that API or that we want to.
2011-03-15T21:29:23  <amstan> ok, that's fine
2011-03-15T21:29:36  <amstan> we can do a new api if it's needed
2011-03-15T21:29:39  <bss03> But, I can implement an add_matches that's at least mostly the same, modulo necessarily schema changes.
2011-03-15T21:30:59  <bss03> But, yeah, that's what I'm gonna replace eventually.  I can prioritize that over getting the SQL just right.
2011-03-15T21:31:25  <bss03> That should make it easier for people with larger data sets or a full-fledge test server to look at the results of the matching algo.
2011-03-15T21:34:25  <bss03> No promises on when; I never seem to have enough time after work.

2011-03-15T22:04:14  <amriedle> the comma error

2011-03-15T22:05:00  <amriedle> i have gotten to the point where commas are stupid :P
2011-03-15T22:05:03  <janzert> I was rather surprised that the schema wasn't the actual output from a mysqldump command

2011-03-15T22:56:01  <amstan_> McLeopold: woot
2011-03-15T22:56:20  <bss03> Python has zip?  Where?
2011-03-15T22:56:22  <McLeopold> so, I need to update the schema file, I forgot to include that in the push
2011-03-15T22:56:29  <McLeopold> python has everything
2011-03-15T22:56:49  <McLeopold> import zipfile
2011-03-15T22:57:01  <bss03> I need to zip current_players [1..]
2011-03-15T22:57:08  <bss03> I mean the functional programming zip.
2011-03-15T22:57:29  <McLeopold> oh
2011-03-15T22:57:36  <bss03> zip [1,2,3] ['a','b','c'] = [(1,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'c')]
2011-03-15T22:57:53  <McLeopold> how come you're in python?
2011-03-15T22:58:08  <janzert> zip([1,2,3], ['a','b','c'])
2011-03-15T22:58:16  <bss03> McLeopold: Working on the matchups stuff.
2011-03-15T22:58:47  <bss03> McLeopold: I think amstan wants be to wrap the existing code in an API so it easier to test.
2011-03-15T22:58:48  <janzert> it's a builtin function btw
2011-03-15T22:58:48  <McLeopold> I though we were going all sql?
2011-03-15T22:58:52  <amstan_> McLeopold: so how stable/complete is the code?
2011-03-15T22:58:59  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2011-03-15T22:59:20  <McLeopold> once I get the sql change pushed, it's stable, but not complete
2011-03-15T22:59:36  <McLeopold> todos...

2011-03-15T23:00:18  <McLeopold> janzert: I pulled, so I've got them
2011-03-15T23:00:21  <bss03> I need to add the player_id column; it's not in my temporary table.
2011-03-15T23:00:41  <amstan> McLeopold: how do you install it?
2011-03-15T23:00:45  <bss03> That's why need the zip([0..],current_players)

2011-03-15T23:01:54  <sigh> enumerate(current_players) is more idomatic, if anyone cares
2011-03-15T23:01:56  <bss03> McLeopold: Speaking of mu and sigma, are our initial values for those available from python?
2011-03-15T23:02:06  <bss03> I know they are defaults for the resp. columns.
2011-03-15T23:02:09  * janzert was about to say the same as sigh
2011-03-15T23:02:18  <McLeopold> defaults in sql
2011-03-15T23:02:30  <McLeopold> amstan: no install, I just keep working on my system
2011-03-15T23:02:56  <bss03> But, I need to use BETA which is derived from initial sigma.
2011-03-15T23:03:11  <McLeopold> Todo: get a submission to add a counter to the database, every so often increment all the sigma's by the counter
2011-03-15T23:03:21  <amstan> McLeopold: well.. what are the steps required to install, assuming i have all dependencies already
2011-03-15T23:03:27  <amstan> McLeopold: just add the cronjobs?
2011-03-15T23:03:47  <McLeopold> amstan: I haven't worked on cron jobs at all, janzert has done all the install scripts
2011-03-15T23:04:05  <McLeopold> So, the latest thing I've done is create worker.py
2011-03-15T23:04:18  <amstan> ok, i guess i should be "interogating" him then
2011-03-15T23:04:27  <McLeopold> for install, yes
2011-03-15T23:04:41  <janzert> the install script don't do anything with cron jobs on the main server yet since I don't know what needs to be run with the new structure
2011-03-15T23:04:53  <bss03> McLeopold, so is there are way to SELECT the default?  Like should I just query sys_tables to get the initial sigma?
2011-03-15T23:05:02  <janzert> it just installs all the packages and points apache at the right spot basically
2011-03-15T23:05:20  <McLeopold> bss03: we will put values in server_info.py then
2011-03-15T23:05:27  <amstan> janzert: so it installs the website pretty much?

2011-03-15T23:06:23  <bss03> McLeopold.  Okay.  I'll add Beta there, too.  It is independently tunable, but the TrueSkill paper suggested initial_sigma / 2 as an example.
2011-03-15T23:06:26  <amstan> oh wow: "src_repo": "git://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge.git",
2011-03-15T23:06:26  <janzert> gets the source repository if needed and sets up the directories and server_info.(py, php) files
2011-03-15T23:06:48  <janzert> creates the contest user
2011-03-15T23:07:00  <janzert> creates the database loads the schema and initial data
2011-03-15T23:07:03  <McLeopold> wow, I like ubuntu desktop :)
2011-03-15T23:07:08  <janzert> I think that's about it :)
2011-03-15T23:07:33  <amstan> janzert: pretty cool
2011-03-15T23:07:45  <amstan> janzert: and what do you mean by "Do NOT run this on a machine that you use for anything else"
2011-03-15T23:08:00  <amstan> what kind of invasive changes?
2011-03-15T23:08:12  <janzert> well, the default is better now but initially the default was what is now --take-over-server
2011-03-15T23:08:28  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-03-15T23:08:29  <janzert> meaning it creates users, points apache default website at the contest site,...
2011-03-15T23:09:00  <janzert> the default may still be a little invasive though so I haven't changed the comment yet
2011-03-15T23:09:39  <amstan> hmm
2011-03-15T23:09:52  <amstan> how invasive? it'
2011-03-15T23:10:10  <janzert> the big thing might be if mysql isn't installed on the server it will install it with a blank root password
2011-03-15T23:10:17  <janzert> not sure how people would feel about that
2011-03-15T23:10:19  <amstan> oh, that's fine
2011-03-15T23:10:26  <amstan> for my case..
2011-03-15T23:10:55  <amstan> i'm just wondering if i can run this on my server for deving without breaking my other sites
2011-03-15T23:11:00  <amstan> or.. anything else
2011-03-15T23:11:02  <janzert> it set up a http://ai-contest.com website with apache
2011-03-15T23:11:12  <janzert> but it won't take over the default site
2011-03-15T23:11:20  <amstan> cool
2011-03-15T23:12:02  <janzert> you can change that url with the website_hostname option but it's not exposed on the command line yet
2011-03-15T23:12:44  <janzert> I think other than that so long as it's run from a full git repo it shouldn't do anything really invasive anymore
2011-03-15T23:13:14  <janzert> it does expect to be run as root still and will try and pick up the username that you sudo'd from
2011-03-15T23:14:24  <amstan> janzert: so it doesn't really do anything that i don't already have installed
2011-03-15T23:14:48  <amstan> as in this: http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/aichallenge/website/
2011-03-15T23:14:49  <janzert> not if you already have the database set up and apache configured
2011-03-15T23:15:04  <janzert> yep, probably not
2011-03-15T23:15:06  <amstan> :( ok, lol
2011-03-15T23:15:14  <amstan> McLeopold: k.. so back to you, how do i install these?
2011-03-15T23:15:24  <janzert> I'm not sure there is anything beyond that that is currently working
2011-03-15T23:15:35  <McLeopold> what do you mean by "these"?
2011-03-15T23:15:45  <amstan> McLeopold: manager+worker
2011-03-15T23:15:55  <McLeopold> they just kinda sit there
2011-03-15T23:16:05  <McLeopold> for the worker, play with worker.py
2011-03-15T23:16:24  <McLeopold> it does compiles and games
2011-03-15T23:16:38  <McLeopold> \o/ for compiling on workers
2011-03-15T23:16:59  <amstan> what's with https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/0_schema.sql ?
2011-03-15T23:16:59  <McLeopold> python worker.py -h
2011-03-15T23:17:17  <McLeopold> that can be removed when we get the jail users going
2011-03-15T23:17:40  <McLeopold> It needs to be added back into sandbox.py
2011-03-15T23:17:59  <amstan> McLeopold: do i have to execute that or something?
2011-03-15T23:18:20  <McLeopold> sandbox? no, it would be called by engine.py, which is called by worker.py
2011-03-15T23:18:44  <bss03> McLeopold: Will transactions work properly in this MySQL DB?  If not, I guess we are fine with a race condition where match is populated before match_player is ready?
2011-03-15T23:18:47  <McLeopold> engine.py modifies the sys.path to get the ants.py game, which I'm not thrilled with, but it works
2011-03-15T23:19:01  <bss03> McLeopold: If not, is there are status flag I'm missing?
2011-03-15T23:19:32  <janzert> amstan: that file is the schema used for the worker database, currently only used to track what jailusers are actively in use
2011-03-15T23:19:35  <McLeopold> bss03: I think we should use transactions, I'm attempting it when I move the matchup data to the game data
2011-03-15T23:19:58  <McLeopold> janzert: have we agreed on jail user management yet?
2011-03-15T23:20:09  <amstan> well.. do i need to set that up if i'm using it?
2011-03-15T23:20:16  <janzert> :) not really, but I was leaving it up to you basically
2011-03-15T23:20:25  <McLeopold> amstan: jail users aren't hooked up, so no
2011-03-15T23:20:40  <janzert> although I did think of another reason for central control of the jailusers
2011-03-15T23:20:45  <McLeopold> do tell
2011-03-15T23:20:51  <bss03> McLeopold: Okay, I'll call commit just before inseting into match/match_player and then again after I am done with them.
2011-03-15T23:20:55  <amstan> janzert: do you do any sort of schema setup in your setup.py?
2011-03-15T23:21:12  <McLeopold> bss03: btw, in a few minutes, it will become matchup/matchup_player
2011-03-15T23:21:21  <janzert> I was looking into a chroot environment for the jailusers and we won't want to create hundreds of those I don't think
2011-03-15T23:21:32  <janzert> amstan: yes
2011-03-15T23:21:42  <McLeopold> janzert: oh, that link I sent a few days ago?
2011-03-15T23:21:52  <janzert> McLeopold: actually no
2011-03-15T23:22:02  <janzert> just ubuntu chroot in general
2011-03-15T23:22:03  <McLeopold> I think chroot is probably the way to go, anyway
2011-03-15T23:22:39  <janzert> yep
2011-03-15T23:23:13  <bss03> McLeopold: Okay.  I'm not gonna commit anything tonight.  It's already past bedtime.

2011-03-15T23:23:53  <McLeopold> janzert: I think sqlite3 would work, mysql is a big hammer to use for the workers, and sqlite3 comes with python
2011-03-15T23:24:02  <bss03> McLeopold: There's two commits in my branch that could be merged (they work) the rest of my local tree is not ready.
2011-03-15T23:24:17  <janzert> that would be fine or just go to a file based lock of some sort
2011-03-15T23:24:28  <janzert> I think zeta already implemented that actually
2011-03-15T23:24:28  <McLeopold> bss03: are you working in epsilon, and not epsilon-new-schema?
2011-03-15T23:24:35  <bss03> McLeopold: I'll probably rebase tomorrow evening before I start work on this anyway.
2011-03-15T23:24:46  <McLeopold> janzert: would you be willing to do the jail user stuff?
2011-03-15T23:24:57  <bss03> McLeopold: Just rebased onto epsilon from where I was.  No confilcts or anything.
2011-03-15T23:25:08  <McLeopold> bss03: cause epsilon-new-schema is not used anymore
2011-03-15T23:25:08  <janzert> ehh, don't count on me doing it but I may be able to if no one else gets to it first
2011-03-15T23:25:48  <McLeopold> amstan: what about you? are you comfortable with setting up jail users with chroot?
2011-03-15T23:26:09  <amstan> McLeopold: nope, i have no idea what i'm doing yet
2011-03-15T23:26:40  <McLeopold> hmm... what about jbroman?

2011-03-15T23:27:19  <bss03> Do we have a target date yet?  I heard something about Fri + 2 weeks?
2011-03-15T23:27:46  <amstan> bss03: would be nice
2011-03-15T23:27:56  <amstan> but probably won't happen

2011-03-15T23:31:28  <amstan> McLeopold: it pretty much is a forum, with tags
2011-03-15T23:31:43  <McLeopold> can they be "closed"
2011-03-15T23:32:37  <amstan> McLeopold: yes
2011-03-15T23:32:53  <McLeopold> but not by anyone, right?
2011-03-15T23:33:00  <amstan> McLeopold: not sure

2011-03-15T23:46:09  <McLeopold> can we start a todo list on etherpad?

2011-03-15T23:58:42  * janzert wonders if api_* should move to api/*
2011-03-15T23:58:55  <amstan> McLeopold: well, what about the build systems? are we gonna support that?
2011-03-15T23:58:58  <amstan> janzert: +1
2011-03-15T23:58:59  <janzert> would make my directory listing easier to find stuff in :P
2011-03-15T23:59:50  <janzert> actually probably worker_api/* would be even better
