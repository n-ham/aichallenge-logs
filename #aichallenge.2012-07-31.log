2012-07-31T05:24:05  <mcstar> mleise: i couldnt resist, i implemented the ternary search tree too :(
2012-07-31T05:24:27  <mleise> i knew you would :p and what is the result?
2012-07-31T05:24:37  <mcstar> it is working
2012-07-31T05:24:37  <mleise> it uses more memory right?
2012-07-31T05:24:54  <mcstar> 13 secs for 200K load/reread
2012-07-31T05:25:15  <mleise> 13 secs hmm. not too convincing :/
2012-07-31T05:25:17  *** kilae <kilae!~chatzilla@catv-161-018.tbwil.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2012-07-31T05:25:52  <mcstar> well, used max 5.5% of my memory
2012-07-31T05:26:01  <mcstar> thats really low
2012-07-31T05:26:14  <mcstar> with the strict ocaml prefix trie i couldnt even load the whole dict up
2012-07-31T05:26:19  <mcstar> >4.5 gigs
2012-07-31T05:26:46  <mcstar> this uses <300MB
2012-07-31T05:27:00  <mcstar> and it is faster than the prefix trie
2012-07-31T05:27:09  <mcstar> since that was like 16 seconds
2012-07-31T05:27:29  <mcstar> if i turn on the performance governor, the time is half of this, 13 secs
2012-07-31T05:27:41  <mcstar> ah, i said 13 in the first place ok
2012-07-31T05:27:54  <mcstar> 26-27 with powersave governor
2012-07-31T05:28:17  <mcstar> (i dont want to overheat unnecessarily my cpu...)

2012-07-31T05:28:46  <mcstar> mleise: and this is a naive, fully-lazy implementation
2012-07-31T05:28:52  <mcstar> everything is boxed, and so on
2012-07-31T05:28:57  <mcstar> very ineffective
2012-07-31T05:29:44  <mcstar> http://hpaste.org/72376
2012-07-31T05:29:48  <mleise> ok, so the algorithm is actually working out positive for you. how about the ondemand governor?
2012-07-31T05:30:09  <mleise> oh ... it is so short again
2012-07-31T05:30:45  <mcstar> mleise: thats 13 secs, ~3 secs better than the prefix one
2012-07-31T05:30:48  <mcstar> ah fuck
2012-07-31T05:30:49  <mcstar> sry
2012-07-31T05:30:57  <mcstar> ondemand == performance
2012-07-31T05:31:10  <mcstar> since it switches on to full throttle immediately
2012-07-31T05:31:43  <mleise> but most of the time it clocks your cpu down
2012-07-31T05:32:01  <mcstar> mleise: the first thing i wrote looked similar, but it wasnt a correct implementation
2012-07-31T05:32:08  <mcstar> i had to actually understand the algorithm
2012-07-31T05:32:14  <mcstar> not that trivial as i first thought
2012-07-31T05:32:28  <mleise> yes, it is easy to make mistakes when you don't understand corner cases
2012-07-31T05:32:33  <mcstar> no
2012-07-31T05:32:39  <mcstar> i didnt uderstand the algorithm
2012-07-31T05:32:43  <mcstar> not a corner case
2012-07-31T05:32:52  <mcstar> i didnt understand why it worked at all
2012-07-31T05:34:53  <mleise> how did you mark the end of string?
2012-07-31T05:35:34  <mcstar> end
2012-07-31T05:35:46  <mcstar> data TST = Empty | Node Char Bool TST TST TST
2012-07-31T05:35:49  <mcstar> the Bool here
2012-07-31T05:36:01  <mleise> ah i see
2012-07-31T05:38:56  <mcstar> 5 seconds with strict constructor fields
2012-07-31T05:39:03  <mcstar> thats 2.5s in reality
2012-07-31T05:39:25  <mcstar> data TST = Empty | Node !Char !Bool !TST !TST !TST
2012-07-31T05:39:34  <mcstar> all i changed, is i added the !s
2012-07-31T05:40:51  <mleise> oh, that's more than twice as fast?!
2012-07-31T05:41:03  <mcstar> 13 -> 2.5
2012-07-31T05:41:20  <mleise> oh because of the cpu speed, right
2012-07-31T05:41:48  <mleise> so 5 times faster??? are you kidding me? all for a few !s?
2012-07-31T05:41:50  <mcstar> real    0m2.459s
2012-07-31T05:42:21  <mcstar> vs.
2012-07-31T05:42:31  <mcstar> real    0m13.355s
2012-07-31T05:42:44  <mcstar> a few !s can make a big difference
2012-07-31T05:42:53  <mcstar> when the system doesnt have to thunk the constructor fields
2012-07-31T05:43:17  <mcstar> imagine, that instead of having unevaluated functions in the fields, you have actual data
2012-07-31T05:44:03  <mcstar> if making a data structure strict doesnt change the semantics, then you should make it stricit
2012-07-31T05:44:41  <mcstar> i like this very much
2012-07-31T05:44:44  <mcstar> this tree*
2012-07-31T05:45:03  <mcstar> mleise: what is you overall timing for a load/check cycle for 200K words?
2012-07-31T05:46:33  <mcstar> %GC     time      52.8%
2012-07-31T05:46:34  <UncleVasya> You are doing something smart or I can join?
2012-07-31T05:46:41  <mcstar> thats pretty bad still
2012-07-31T05:46:56  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you can join either way
2012-07-31T05:47:25  <mleise> mcstar: 689 ms for the whole program, but I'm loading the dictionary twice now
2012-07-31T05:47:34  <UncleVasya> OK, to join and be able to do something :D
2012-07-31T05:47:35  <mleise> once for the dictionary and once as the words to look up
2012-07-31T05:48:32  <mleise> lookup is around 217 ms
2012-07-31T05:48:40  <mcstar> mleise: was your computer faster than mine?
2012-07-31T05:48:44  <mcstar> i guess it was
2012-07-31T05:48:48  <mcstar> do you have ghc?
2012-07-31T05:48:50  <mleise> yes, 2,00 Ghz
2012-07-31T05:49:02  <mcstar> no, i meant it was an intel
2012-07-31T05:49:05  <mcstar> core2 or something
2012-07-31T05:49:16  <mleise> core 2 duo
2012-07-31T05:49:17  <mcstar> iirc you had ghc
2012-07-31T05:49:22  <mleise> i have ghc, yes
2012-07-31T05:49:29  <mcstar> do you want to try it?
2012-07-31T05:49:34  <mcstar> ill send the full code
2012-07-31T05:49:59  <mcstar> though, i cant seprate the load from the check
2012-07-31T05:50:08  <mcstar> since the computation is still lazy
2012-07-31T05:50:22  <mleise> ok, send me the code :)

2012-07-31T05:54:21  <mcstar> isnt really necessary
2012-07-31T05:54:26  <mcstar> doesnt make it faster
2012-07-31T05:54:45  <mcstar> if the code was more optimized, it could make a difference
2012-07-31T05:55:08  <mcstar> llvm doest really make lazy code faster
2012-07-31T05:55:25  <mleise> ok, because my GHC doesn't understand that flag
2012-07-31T05:55:32  <mcstar> oh

2012-07-31T05:57:51  <mleise> I'll install 4.7.1 anyway...
2012-07-31T05:58:14  <mcstar> i lot happens to ghc in 2 years
2012-07-31T05:59:41  <mcstar> UncleVasya: implement the ternary tree in ocaml
2012-07-31T05:59:54  <mcstar> you can translate the haskell version
2012-07-31T06:00:11  <mcstar> (well, a suggestsion, if you want to do that...)
2012-07-31T06:00:19  * UncleVasya is going to wiki

2012-07-31T06:01:30  <mcstar> are you building ghc from source?
2012-07-31T06:01:34  <mleise> when i install GHC with llvm enabled, LLVM is pulled in
2012-07-31T06:01:39  <mcstar> ok
2012-07-31T06:01:49  <mcstar> if you build it, then you need it
2012-07-31T06:01:52  <mleise> and there is a flag for OCaml, but I don't need that right?
2012-07-31T06:02:03  <mcstar> oh
2012-07-31T06:02:10  <mcstar> i guess not
2012-07-31T06:02:18  <mleise> just because you mentioned Ocaml somewhere earlier
2012-07-31T06:02:28  <mcstar> yeah, cause i like that as well
2012-07-31T06:02:35  <mcstar> but these has nothing to do with each other afaik

2012-07-31T06:02:56  <mcstar> perl  gmp>=5.0  gcc
2012-07-31T06:03:07  <mcstar> these are the dependecies of a packaged ghc
2012-07-31T06:03:21  <mleise> yeah gmp is pulled in by gcc afaik
2012-07-31T06:04:07  <mleise> they are also all "system" packages that aren't even mentioned as explicit dependencies
2012-07-31T06:04:24  <mleise> that sucks sometimes when you want to create a thumb drive installation

2012-07-31T08:32:51  <mleise> mcstar: with the new GHC it seems to be marginally faster. for the sorted word list i get 1.4 seconds even
2012-07-31T08:33:09  <mcstar> great
2012-07-31T08:33:12  <UncleVasya> mcstar, I've just read that dark-coloured IDE is better for eyes. Is your IDE dark-coloured? :)
2012-07-31T08:33:30  <mcstar> UncleVasya: my eye is dark colored, does that count?
2012-07-31T08:33:57  <mcstar> my color scheme is quite light

2012-07-31T10:13:29  <mcstar> mleise: i fiddled with it some more, 2.45 -> 1.35
2012-07-31T10:14:03  <mleise> holy shit, you get close to systems programming languages with haskell
2012-07-31T10:14:13  <mcstar> yeah
2012-07-31T10:14:23  <mcstar> i didnt even do any serious optimizations
2012-07-31T10:14:32  <mcstar> just changed from list based strings to bytestring
2012-07-31T10:14:43  <mcstar> which are arrays basically
2012-07-31T10:14:57  <mleise> so you have a lot of low hanging fruits when it comes to optimization
2012-07-31T10:15:36  <mcstar> you have choices thats for sure
2012-07-31T10:16:08  <mleise> did you use a sorted list of words?
2012-07-31T10:16:09  <mcstar> very comfortable/slow -> less comfortable but quite fast -> ugly/fast as C
2012-07-31T10:16:26  <mcstar> mleise: i used the file i always have
2012-07-31T10:16:56  <mleise> yes, but a sorted list is faster than a real world example
2012-07-31T10:17:03  <mcstar> ok
2012-07-31T10:17:31  <mcstar> i dont i will ever use that data structure in real life
2012-07-31T10:17:33  <mcstar> so i dont mind
2012-07-31T10:17:37  <mcstar> dont think*
2012-07-31T10:18:13  <mleise> ok, then do it for the sake of clean benchmarks :D
2012-07-31T10:18:37  <mcstar> i told you to benchmark with the same file
2012-07-31T10:18:40  <mcstar> as me
2012-07-31T10:18:56  <mcstar> how am i supposed to scramble the file?
2012-07-31T10:19:06  <mleise> sort -R
2012-07-31T10:19:22  <mcstar> but that wont be the same order as yours
2012-07-31T10:20:12  <mleise> hmm, but at least close
2012-07-31T10:20:35  <mcstar> 1.35
2012-07-31T10:20:44  <mleise> the same speed, hm
2012-07-31T10:21:16  <mleise> i didn't expect this. ternary search trees are sensitive to insertion order
2012-07-31T10:21:23  <mleise> the more random, the more even the tree
2012-07-31T10:21:33  <mcstar> hm
2012-07-31T10:21:45  <mcstar> well, the structure is definitely sensitive
2012-07-31T10:21:53  <mcstar> but im not sure about the speed
2012-07-31T10:22:26  <mcstar> how does your behave wrt sorted input?
2012-07-31T10:22:28  <mcstar> yours*
2012-07-31T10:22:36  <mleise> let me check
2012-07-31T10:23:39  <mleise> random: 181 ms insert / 179 ms lookup
2012-07-31T10:23:51  <mleise> sorted: 82 ms insert / 69 ms lookup
2012-07-31T10:24:26  <mcstar> you said it took ~700ms total
2012-07-31T10:24:31  <mleise> oh wait, that was the radix tree, but we are talking TST right?
2012-07-31T10:24:36  <mcstar> right
2012-07-31T10:25:10  <mleise> sorted: 218 ms insert / 139 ms
2012-07-31T10:25:34  <mleise> random: 311 ms insert / 236 ms lookup
2012-07-31T10:26:36  <mleise> (+ loading the files, + cleaning up afterwards)
2012-07-31T10:27:09  <mcstar> oh fuck
2012-07-31T10:27:20  <mcstar> i did it with the sorted file
2012-07-31T10:27:28  <mcstar> 2.4 vs. 1.25
2012-07-31T10:27:31  <mcstar> 2.4 vs. 1.35
2012-07-31T10:27:47  <mcstar> similar slowdown afterall

2012-07-31T10:29:21  <mcstar> i dont like it

2012-07-31T10:33:50  <UncleVasya> I'm on a stage:  'Found out how to bound compilers to Notepad++ in the right way. Ready to make it and start OCaml coding'.
2012-07-31T10:34:19  <mcstar> UncleVasya: have you tried utop?
2012-07-31T10:34:23  <mcstar> nice ocaml toplevel
2012-07-31T10:34:29  <mcstar> and use batteries
2012-07-31T10:34:37  <mcstar> really good standard library replacement
2012-07-31T10:34:46  <mcstar> and try out tuareg or typerex
2012-07-31T10:34:57  <mcstar> great ocaml modes for eamcs
2012-07-31T10:35:01  <mcstar> emacs*
2012-07-31T10:35:15  <UncleVasya> For I am at notebook now I have to setup my dev environment. Decided to move from Geany to Notepad++.
2012-07-31T10:35:32  <mcstar> whats the difference?
2012-07-31T10:35:36  <mcstar> neither of them is emacs
2012-07-31T10:35:55  <UncleVasya> tuareg or typerex are Emacs enhancement, I don't have emacs.
2012-07-31T10:36:25  <mcstar> yeah, but you should have it :)
2012-07-31T10:36:40  <UncleVasya> And I still typing too slow so sometimes it seems I answer not the right question :)
2012-07-31T10:36:53  <UncleVasya> I'm on Win.
2012-07-31T10:37:55  <UncleVasya> batteries is a replacement, not an additional thing?
2012-07-31T10:38:28  <mcstar> http://hpaste.org/72392
2012-07-31T10:38:36  <UncleVasya> And how do you know about batteries? You've tried OCaml? :D
2012-07-31T10:38:57  <mcstar> UncleVasya: check this out, if you need to polar integrate some numerical data on a grid
2012-07-31T10:39:07  <mcstar> UncleVasya: ofc

2012-07-31T10:41:32  <mcstar> mleise: i think i managed to separate the two phases
2012-07-31T10:41:45  <mcstar> 1.13 to load, 0.180 to check
2012-07-31T10:41:49  <mcstar> thats the sorted file
2012-07-31T10:42:09  <mcstar> unsorted: 2.06 vs  0.297
2012-07-31T10:42:16  <mleise> I find that somewhat impressive for Haskell :)
2012-07-31T10:42:30  <mleise> not the load, but the lookup
2012-07-31T10:42:37  <mcstar> i should extract the real load time from the first values
2012-07-31T10:42:57  <mcstar> i guess you dont count in file load time, right?
2012-07-31T10:43:56  <UncleVasya> arghh, I had to write down how I made ocamlopt work on my system several months ago... So today is the day of making OCaml work :)
2012-07-31T10:45:00  <mcstar> UncleVasya: use ocamlfind
2012-07-31T10:45:15  <mcstar> i was strongly suggested by members of the community to use it
2012-07-31T10:46:13  <UncleVasya> So you now have far more knowledge in OCaml than I do. Smiley turned you to the Dark side? :D
2012-07-31T10:46:24  <mcstar> i like haskell better
2012-07-31T10:46:36  <mcstar> but ocaml is better than some other languages
2012-07-31T10:46:39  <mcstar> so i like it too
2012-07-31T10:47:11  <mcstar> smilye doesnt have much to do with me turning anywhere
2012-07-31T10:47:55  <mleise> mcstar: yes, file load time is extra
2012-07-31T10:50:07  <UncleVasya> So would you tell me a story about you and OCaml. A story of times when I wasn't here :)
2012-07-31T10:50:15  <UncleVasya> *?
2012-07-31T10:50:36  <mcstar> theres not much to tell
2012-07-31T10:50:56  <mcstar> i just made myself familiar a bit, with the ecosystem
2012-07-31T10:50:59  <mcstar> thats all
2012-07-31T10:51:21  <mcstar> what i pasted, was my first useful program, that i actually use
2012-07-31T10:51:50  <mcstar> mleise: load time is a couple of miliseconds
2012-07-31T10:52:07  <mcstar> however i noticed, it takes some time for the ghc RTS to stand up
2012-07-31T10:52:38  <mcstar> like !0.2 seconds
2012-07-31T10:52:41  <mcstar> like ~0.2 seconds
2012-07-31T10:53:47  <mcstar> i try increasing stack and heap allocation
2012-07-31T10:54:50  <mleise> O.o ...ok
2012-07-31T10:55:37  <mcstar> doesnt help, it doesnt allocate that much
2012-07-31T10:55:48  <mcstar> it helped a lot with the prefix trie
2012-07-31T10:56:09  <mcstar> mleise: ah, and whats your peak memory usage? you forgot to mention that XD
2012-07-31T10:57:12  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2012-07-31T10:58:12  <mleise> I built a counter right into the data structure. It is not 'accurate' as in OS memory pages used by process, but reflects exactly how many bytes of memory I requested: 17499492 bytes
2012-07-31T10:58:15  <mcstar> 101 MB total memory in use
2012-07-31T10:58:38  <mcstar> aha, thats quite nice
2012-07-31T10:59:03  <mcstar> but then, i dont understand why did you say that it uses more memory than the prefix trie?
2012-07-31T10:59:15  <mcstar> that one really used gigabytes!
2012-07-31T10:59:39  <mcstar> and this one used 17MB for you? thats nothing
2012-07-31T11:00:08  <mleise> because my prefix trie uses only 17206176 bytes :p
2012-07-31T11:00:43  <mcstar> your prefix trie must store the nodes in the ether
2012-07-31T11:00:58  <mleise> remember that I trimmed the arrays from char[256] to char[first .. last]
2012-07-31T11:01:12  <mcstar> yeah
2012-07-31T11:01:17  <mleise> so the terminal nodes usually are a char[1]
2012-07-31T11:01:18  <mcstar> ether
2012-07-31T11:01:26  <mleise> right ;)
2012-07-31T11:01:55  <mleise> a small variation of the prefix trie, actually pretty simple but very effective
2012-07-31T11:02:48  <mcstar> in a situtaion
2012-07-31T11:03:00  <mleise> I think it isn't fair to say that "prefix tries use so much more memory than ternary search trees" when such a simple fix can remedee the situation
2012-07-31T11:03:06  <mcstar> but when you take average and worst case performance, it will be the same
2012-07-31T11:03:23  <mcstar> it is a correct statement
2012-07-31T11:03:57  <mcstar> but in practice, your improvement can be significant
2012-07-31T11:04:14  <mcstar> i cant implement that optimization in my haskell one
2012-07-31T11:04:32  <mcstar> that used a double allocation scheme of linear arrays
2012-07-31T11:04:44  <mleise> it can be? it makes ternary search trees superfluous for this use cas
2012-07-31T11:04:46  <mcstar> and to resize them is not feasible
2012-07-31T11:05:18  <mcstar> the ternary tree is much simpler
2012-07-31T11:05:23  <mleise> ok, so computer sience has to go the safe way and define a prefix trie the way it is
2012-07-31T11:05:33  <mcstar> ok, thats an exaggeration, but a bit simpler
2012-07-31T11:05:55  <mcstar> mleise: you can call yours an adaptive prefix trie

2012-07-31T11:06:36  <mleise> hehe, I don't think that it deserves a name of its own. A new programming language may apply this optimization by itself.
2012-07-31T11:06:59  <mcstar> hm?
2012-07-31T11:07:04  <mcstar> i dont understand that last part
2012-07-31T11:07:17  <mcstar> anyway, to not store the whole array is not a new idea
2012-07-31T11:07:26  <mleise> some language may have http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array
2012-07-31T11:07:29  <mcstar> there are variations, when the nodes are little hashtables
2012-07-31T11:07:36  <mcstar> or little balanced trees
2012-07-31T11:07:54  <mleise> HAT-trie?
2012-07-31T11:08:23  <mcstar> mleise: i still dont understand what does a language have to do with any of this
2012-07-31T11:08:40  <mleise> I mean, a language may already offer arrays that do what I did manually

2012-07-31T11:09:05  <mleise> e.g. an array type that limits itself to the set slots
2012-07-31T11:09:33  <mleise> well, one could always use a hash with char lookup
2012-07-31T11:09:39  <mcstar> yes
2012-07-31T11:09:58  <mcstar> there are libraries of generic indexable collections
2012-07-31T11:10:06  <mleise> so i think I didn't use a different algorithm in the first place
2012-07-31T11:10:28  <mleise> it is an implementation detail
2012-07-31T11:11:00  <mcstar> well, it isnt, if it changes the complexity of the algorithm
2012-07-31T11:11:04  <mcstar> imho
2012-07-31T11:11:11  <mcstar> anyway, this is moot
2012-07-31T11:11:13  <mleise> does it change the complexity?
2012-07-31T11:11:22  <mcstar> it does
2012-07-31T11:11:31  <mcstar> oh, one question
2012-07-31T11:11:39  <mcstar> how do you resize the array?
2012-07-31T11:11:49  <mcstar> you allocate a new, longer one?
2012-07-31T11:11:56  <mcstar> and copy over from the old one?
2012-07-31T11:12:10  <mleise> I use the standard function 'realloc'
2012-07-31T11:12:44  <mleise> it asks the OS to extend the memory and if that fails allocates a new memory block and copies over the data
2012-07-31T11:12:56  <mcstar> aha
2012-07-31T11:13:18  <mcstar> i think D stands for Devil
2012-07-31T11:13:32  <mleise> but it is a C function :D
2012-07-31T11:13:46  <mleise> actually I write C if I look at my code

2012-07-31T11:35:59  <UncleVasya> heheh, it needs 43mb to be downloaded. So no,  dont have emacs now :) Will download at the late August.
2012-07-31T11:38:13  * UncleVasya is praying to find MinGW on some of his drives. Without mingw I will find something instead of ocaml.
2012-07-31T11:41:47  <mcstar> UncleVasya: even if you dont have mingw you can use ocaml

2012-07-31T11:53:16  <antimatroid> i dosed off, didn't intend to go to sleep aha
2012-07-31T11:53:26  <antimatroid> i have a bit more work to do then bed

2012-07-31T11:55:26  <mcstar> i guess its too late for that
2012-07-31T11:58:19  <antimatroid> i don't drink coffee
2012-07-31T11:58:21  <antimatroid> hate the taste
2012-07-31T12:20:47  <mleise> just made me a cup of cappuchino
2012-07-31T12:22:15  <mcstar> no h
2012-07-31T12:22:32  <mcstar> cappuccino
2012-07-31T12:22:58  <mcstar> i hope it tastes better after i corrected you
2012-07-31T12:23:02  <mcstar> XD
2012-07-31T12:23:12  <mcstar> i know, im a retard
2012-07-31T12:23:24  <mcstar> anyway, i started to translate the program to ocaml

2012-07-31T12:49:22  <mcstar> yes
2012-07-31T12:49:39  <mleise> i see why it is so rarely used ;)

2012-07-31T12:50:40  <mcstar> UncleVasya: ^^
2012-07-31T12:50:46  <mcstar> mleise: what is rarely used?
2012-07-31T12:51:08  <mleise> OCaml
2012-07-31T12:51:23  <mleise> nothing but trouble with the stack
2012-07-31T12:51:45  <mcstar> because of heavy use of non tail recursive algorithms in a strict language?
2012-07-31T12:51:53  <mcstar> how is that any different from D?
2012-07-31T12:52:01  <mleise> and I remember the everlasting bug in MLDonkey, where it the CPU usage would increase over time
2012-07-31T12:52:24  * mleise looks up what tail recursive means on Wikipedia
2012-07-31T12:53:51  <mleise> so tail recursive means, I can reuse the stack of the first call into the recursive function, because the actual recursion is the very last instruction in it
2012-07-31T12:54:58  <mcstar> yeah, recursion in constant space
2012-07-31T12:55:09  <mcstar> well, when it is optimized
2012-07-31T12:56:49  <mleise> it has technical similarities with continuation passing
2012-07-31T13:04:05  <mcstar> weird
2012-07-31T13:04:19  <mcstar> the so happens in a tail rec. fuction
2012-07-31T13:05:03  <mcstar> maybe List.rev isnt tail rec.

2012-07-31T13:54:24  <mcstar> the problem was, that i used exception handling in a way, so that tail recursion didnt happen
2012-07-31T13:54:25  <mleise> good good
2012-07-31T13:54:59  <mcstar> no more benchmarking for a week!
2012-07-31T13:56:13  * mcstar wonders if UncleVasya will show his code, maybe his will be even faster
2012-07-31T13:56:34  <mcstar> well, he wrote his game tree evalution in ocaml, and that must be fast
2012-07-31T13:57:48  * UncleVasya is trying to make ocamlopt work :D
2012-07-31T14:00:39  <UncleVasya> in fact, I managed it to compile my Ants bot. And compiled version even works. But during compilation there were odd warnings from linker and bot file size differs from the one I compiled at home pc (now it 70kb less).
2012-07-31T14:05:06  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you can compile with ocamlc too
2012-07-31T14:05:09  <mcstar> it is even faster
2012-07-31T14:05:14  <mcstar> (to compile..)
2012-07-31T14:06:11  <UncleVasya> yep, I used it in the very beginning. So now for me it's a step back :p
2012-07-31T14:06:40  <mcstar> step back?
2012-07-31T14:06:46  <mcstar> it is for testing your code
2012-07-31T14:07:10  <mcstar> you dont need native compilation every time
2012-07-31T14:07:14  <mcstar> just like with haskell
2012-07-31T14:07:21  <mcstar> you can load your code up into ghci
2012-07-31T14:07:25  <mcstar> test it, whatever
2012-07-31T14:07:33  <mcstar> and compile when ready
2012-07-31T14:17:48  <UncleVasya> okay, I'm accepting the presence of these warnings for now. At least executables seem to work :)
2012-07-31T14:18:14  <mcstar> UncleVasya: can you paste a warning?
2012-07-31T14:18:15  <UncleVasya> btw, mcstar, is my English better than before? :D
2012-07-31T14:18:37  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i spotted some errors
2012-07-31T14:18:44  <mcstar> but overall, i would say yes
2012-07-31T14:21:31  <UncleVasya> I think the issue is that I don't have a cygwin which is the requirement. Strange, but on home PC I have no cygwin too, but haven't seen these warnings.  I can past them but I think it is too small thing to waste your time on it.
2012-07-31T14:22:17  <UncleVasya> >  but overall, i would say yes     and it is strange, because I did nothing to improve it :D
2012-07-31T14:22:42  <mcstar> maybe, you just pay more attention to it
2012-07-31T14:22:59  <UncleVasya> okay, so now I finish setuping  work environment and tomorrow I'll try to start coding your tree.
2012-07-31T14:23:25  <mcstar> UncleVasya: well, i have my tree
2012-07-31T14:23:33  <mcstar> it is going to be yours
2012-07-31T14:23:50  <mcstar> so, do it if you like, but im not pushing you :)
2012-07-31T14:24:04  <mcstar> UncleVasya: have you seen my code?

2012-07-31T14:27:04  <UncleVasya> No, I must to write from scratch. Because if I see your code I'll understand that writing own totally pointless, for my crap will be really crap comparing to your program :)
