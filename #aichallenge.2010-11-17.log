2010-11-17T00:00:03  <janzert> which group are you using for it?
2010-11-17T00:00:10  <amstan> janzert: global moderators
2010-11-17T00:00:28  <amstan> janzert: like.. if they have a say in here, they should have mod powers too
2010-11-17T00:00:29  <McLeopold> Accoun: yes, with the radius at 17
2010-11-17T00:00:50  <bhasker> heh my bot is too conservative
2010-11-17T00:00:51  <janzert> amstan: makes sense I suppose
2010-11-17T00:01:06  <bhasker> and this version even more so
2010-11-17T00:01:08  <bhasker> and loses a lot more
2010-11-17T00:01:09  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-17T00:01:24  <Accoun> McLeopold> pleaze use 12 like on official
2010-11-17T00:01:42  <McLeopold> janzert: Are you willing to nail down the map specs yet?
2010-11-17T00:02:00  <janzert> amstan: aikon
2010-11-17T00:02:02  <janzert> ?
2010-11-17T00:02:12  <amstan> @seen a1k0n
2010-11-17T00:02:12  <contestbot> amstan: a1k0n was last seen in #aichallenge 2 days, 22 hours, 12 minutes, and 6 seconds ago: <a1k0n> right, they announced immediately the final tournament would be on bigger maps for tron
2010-11-17T00:02:20  <amstan> k, decent
2010-11-17T00:02:31  <janzert> McLeopold: hope to do some work on it tonight and get it up tomorrow
2010-11-17T00:02:48  <McLeopold> So you're going to modify the code?
2010-11-17T00:03:07  <janzert> McLeopold: the only functional change I know of is going to be the radius of the maps
2010-11-17T00:03:15  <janzert> the other is bug fixing
2010-11-17T00:03:18  <McLeopold> I see a bug in the current
2010-11-17T00:03:26  <McLeopold> It's generating planets over 100 ships.
2010-11-17T00:03:30  <janzert> right
2010-11-17T00:03:44  <davidjliu> McLeopold: cool, thanks
2010-11-17T00:04:04  <janzert> that's what I meant by bug fixing, none of the maps actually generated ended up with that problem did they?
2010-11-17T00:04:13  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-17T00:04:19  <janzert> ahh, didn't realize that
2010-11-17T00:04:28  <McLeopold> http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=1657
2010-11-17T00:04:34  <McLeopold> It's one I generated
2010-11-17T00:04:45  <McLeopold> 151 +5 neutrals
2010-11-17T00:04:46  <janzert> ahh, yeah I meant on the contest server
2010-11-17T00:04:59  <janzert> but yes I do plan on fixing that
2010-11-17T00:05:46  <janzert> amstan: how about bocsimacko/mega?
2010-11-17T00:06:03  <amstan> janzert: we can add them as we go
2010-11-17T00:06:11  <mega1> McLeopold:  is this the bug: 5*distance(p1, p2)-1 ?
2010-11-17T00:06:14  <Mjothitnir> map 30 has a 106 pair
2010-11-17T00:06:18  <mega1> what about me?
2010-11-17T00:06:18  <janzert> uh oh, user defined groups disappeared?
2010-11-17T00:06:39  <amstan> mega1: we're moving away from the mailing list system
2010-11-17T00:06:40  <Mjothitnir> make that "map_r528_30.txt"
2010-11-17T00:06:43  <janzert> mega1: added for posting access and moderator on theforums
2010-11-17T00:06:54  <janzert> Mjothitnir: ahh, ok
2010-11-17T00:07:00  <amstan> mega1: we'll just have a forum, and we were wondering if we should give you posting access to that special forum
2010-11-17T00:07:14  <McLeopold> honestly, I don't know why ship count should be anything other than a random number between 1 and 100
2010-11-17T00:08:09  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm, yeah. antimatroid might be able to clarify that although I think may just be something left from the original generator
2010-11-17T00:08:48  <mega1> :-o
2010-11-17T00:09:06  <amstan> mega1: such people also become global moderators
2010-11-17T00:09:24  <mega1> McLeopold: that's probably the rage bot thingy
2010-11-17T00:09:30  <janzert> amstan: did all the user defined groups just disappear? They seem to have here
2010-11-17T00:09:33  <McLeopold> janzert: I have my own map generator.  I'll share it on bitbucket.
2010-11-17T00:09:38  <amstan> janzert: yeah, removed them
2010-11-17T00:09:40  <mega1> I think that can be pretty important.
2010-11-17T00:09:44  <janzert> amstan: ok
2010-11-17T00:09:47  <amstan> janzert: contest organizer vs admin was redundant
2010-11-17T00:09:51  <amstan> and the others too
2010-11-17T00:10:03  <McLeopold> mega1: yes, but the entire map should be checked after generation and kept or discarded.
2010-11-17T00:10:18  <McLeopold> Otherwise you'll introduce weird bias
2010-11-17T00:10:22  <janzert> McLeopold: I really only want to make the absolute minimum changes I can to fix the stuff that cropped up with this one if possible
2010-11-17T00:10:34  <mega1> McLeopold: sure
2010-11-17T00:10:44  <mega1> janzert: then revert it
2010-11-17T00:10:50  <McLeopold> janzert: I got to say, alot of the generation stuff doesn't make sense to me.
2010-11-17T00:11:01  <McLeopold> I think it's maps are not random enough
2010-11-17T00:11:07  <antimatroid> the neutrals with more than 100 ships are from line 184
2010-11-17T00:11:10  <janzert> well I'm the wrong one to ask about it :)
2010-11-17T00:11:16  <antimatroid> the bug mega1 was talking aobut
2010-11-17T00:11:57  <antimatroid> you want to min the number with 100
2010-11-17T00:12:08  <McLeopold> no, that's not good enough
2010-11-17T00:12:20  <antimatroid> why?
2010-11-17T00:12:26  <McLeopold> It makes lots of planets at exatly 100.
2010-11-17T00:12:34  <antimatroid> it only does it for 1 planet
2010-11-17T00:12:40  <antimatroid> the non-snipable one
2010-11-17T00:12:40  <McLeopold> pick a number between 1 and 10, then trim to no more than 2
2010-11-17T00:12:45  <McLeopold> that is not a 50/50 split
2010-11-17T00:12:47  <antimatroid> no sorry, can be snipable,
2010-11-17T00:12:52  <antimatroid> claimable without losing home planet
2010-11-17T00:13:17  <mega1> does one such planet in any way help to avoid draws?
2010-11-17T00:13:17  <antimatroid> well that was a little hack put in for other people, feel free to work out a nicer solution :P
2010-11-17T00:13:36  <antimatroid> mega1: only just, i think it'd work even better if it was non-snipable
2010-11-17T00:14:07  <antimatroid> well, it reduces the set of obvious draw maps anyway, and doesn't really exclude any exciting ones
2010-11-17T00:14:19  <antimatroid> although it does then assume all bots wont play stupidly
2010-11-17T00:14:19  <krokkrok> you know guys, all this fuss about maps is a waste of time.  the final contest will not be able to run but a handful of maps, and it will necessarily be biased in a random unknown way
2010-11-17T00:14:37  <antimatroid> you need more than 5 maps
2010-11-17T00:14:41  <antimatroid> i think
2010-11-17T00:14:53  <janzert> McLeopold: it shouldn't introduce any skew just limiting it to 100
2010-11-17T00:14:53  <mega1> krokkrok: I'm wasting my time precisely to control the way it's biased.
2010-11-17T00:15:13  <krokkrok> chess tournaments are run on one map.
2010-11-17T00:15:23  <antimatroid> that's different

2010-11-17T00:15:45  <krokkrok> yes it is different. for one thing, it is much easier to judge
2010-11-17T00:15:48  <janzert> but not a lot :/
2010-11-17T00:16:04  <antimatroid> all future contest games should be picked just so it's easy to judge?
2010-11-17T00:16:08  <antimatroid> doesn't sound overly exciting
2010-11-17T00:16:10  <krokkrok> yes
2010-11-17T00:16:27  <krokkrok> otherwise, the outcome is random

2010-11-17T00:16:38  <TEAM_AI> hi
2010-11-17T00:16:39  <antimatroid> it's not completely random
2010-11-17T00:16:43  <antimatroid> there is a random factor yes
2010-11-17T00:16:57  <krokkrok> can you calculate how large that random factor is?
2010-11-17T00:17:12  <krokkrok> if you can't, you don't really know what it is you just judged
2010-11-17T00:17:25  <antimatroid> can you do that for anything?
2010-11-17T00:17:31  <krokkrok> of course
2010-11-17T00:17:37  <janzert> actually it's easy to fix correctly http://pastebin.ca/1994156
2010-11-17T00:17:38  <krokkrok> a foot race, nothing random at all
2010-11-17T00:17:38  <mega1> let's trade a 100 little random factors that add up to near zero value to a single random value 100x the magnitude
2010-11-17T00:17:39  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3641), bix0r4ever(3572), asavis(3514), protocolocon(3501), davidjliu(3470), dmj111(3435), shangas(3434), thedreamer(3433), _iouri_(3424), george(3417)
2010-11-17T00:17:46  <antimatroid> there is randomness

2010-11-17T00:18:41  <antimatroid> very bad
2010-11-17T00:18:50  <antimatroid> you just changed the max ships for every neutral
2010-11-17T00:18:58  <krokkrok> team_ai i think its 1 sec
2010-11-17T00:19:10  <antimatroid> unless i'm mistaken?
2010-11-17T00:19:22  <mega1> remove the dependency of population on the distance
2010-11-17T00:19:49  <TEAM_AI> thx krokkrok, that's very little :D
2010-11-17T00:19:49  <janzert> it's a poorly chosen variable name and completely untested yes
2010-11-17T00:20:07  <janzert> mega1: that dependency is only done for 1 pair of planetes
2010-11-17T00:20:09  <mega1> it can still be over 100 for starters
2010-11-17T00:20:15  <rebelxt_> we really need to get a closure on this map generator situation...
2010-11-17T00:20:27  <antimatroid> it's fairly closed
2010-11-17T00:20:34  <antimatroid> it's mostly aesthetics being worked out atm
2010-11-17T00:20:50  <krokkrok> will each bot play on the exact same maps as all other bots in the final tournament?
2010-11-17T00:20:59  <janzert> antimatroid: there is no other max_ships variable
2010-11-17T00:21:02  <amstan> janzert: how's that?
2010-11-17T00:21:09  <janzert> the constant is maxShips
2010-11-17T00:21:15  <antimatroid> ah yeah, that'd be it, sorry :P
2010-11-17T00:21:19  <antimatroid> i saw that and was like ahhh
2010-11-17T00:21:27  <amstan> janzert: can you help me test it? click on people and there's a test user permissions and test if they can/cannot post in there
2010-11-17T00:21:30  <janzert> like I said bad variable name choice though
2010-11-17T00:22:00  <janzert> yep, gotta find it first
2010-11-17T00:22:24  <McLeopold> antimatroid: where does 5 * the home planets distance come from?  what's the logic?
2010-11-17T00:22:29  <krokkrok> will each bot play on the exact same maps as all other bots in the final tournament?
2010-11-17T00:22:41  <antimatroid> McLeopold: so that you can take it without losing your home planet to rage bot
2010-11-17T00:22:43  <mega1> McLeopold: five is the growth of the home planet
2010-11-17T00:23:28  <mega1> You cannot lose your base if you take this planet.
2010-11-17T00:23:30  <McLeopold> oh! I know how to fix it
2010-11-17T00:23:38  <TEAM_AI> happy coding @all & cya l8ter

2010-11-17T00:24:55  <amstan> i have to do that too then
2010-11-17T00:24:57  <amstan> sigh
2010-11-17T00:24:57  <antimatroid> mega1: he's asking for a round robin
2010-11-17T00:25:00  <McLeopold> num_ships = random.randint(minShips, min(maxShips,5*distance(p1, p2))-1)
2010-11-17T00:25:16  <mega1> antimatroid: he didn't
2010-11-17T00:25:19  <McLeopold> don't cap the final result, cap the range
2010-11-17T00:25:37  <amstan> janzert: try now
2010-11-17T00:25:38  <mega1> that's what janzert did
2010-11-17T00:25:50  <antimatroid> mega1: what do you think every bot playing every other bot on a map is? :P
2010-11-17T00:25:51  <McLeopold> yeah, ok, next issue
2010-11-17T00:26:05  <mega1> antimatroid: read it again
2010-11-17T00:26:13  <krokkrok> what i asked for just now is that every bot gets to play on the same map  as every other bot, otherwise, the outcome is randomly biased
2010-11-17T00:26:31  <janzert> amstan: looks like it still works
2010-11-17T00:26:35  <amstan> janzert: darn.. wtf?
2010-11-17T00:26:35  <antimatroid> oh, okay, it's still random
2010-11-17T00:26:50  <antimatroid> sorry :)
2010-11-17T00:26:59  <amstan> janzert: any ideas?
2010-11-17T00:27:10  <mega1> krokkrok: I hope it is like what you suggest and it's going to be random still because the player you get to play on map X is not the same as for other bots.
2010-11-17T00:27:24  <antimatroid> mcleopold is right about that change too
2010-11-17T00:27:28  <krokkrok> mega1: but it could be
2010-11-17T00:28:00  <mega1> krokkrok: for an N player round robin that can be N*N*M matches
2010-11-17T00:28:15  <antimatroid> i think idealy you want to play on the same map many times
2010-11-17T00:28:15  <mega1> where M is the number of maps
2010-11-17T00:28:26  <krokkrok> in chess, M is 1
2010-11-17T00:28:32  <mega1> antimatroid: that's the best way to increase variance
2010-11-17T00:28:33  <janzert> amstan: not really, I haven't done a lot with phpbb
2010-11-17T00:28:34  <krokkrok> works for them
2010-11-17T00:28:58  <antimatroid> gah, there's like 3 different conversations in here now :|
2010-11-17T00:29:11  <krokkrok> also it doesnt have to be N*N, simply, 100*100

2010-11-17T00:29:34  <mega1> sarcasm ^^^
2010-11-17T00:30:16  <mega1> in other words you introduce a huge random value when choosing that simple map
2010-11-17T00:30:18  <mega1> *single
2010-11-17T00:30:20  <Mjothitnir> you'd still have the problem of choosing the 100
2010-11-17T00:30:37  <krokkrok> if all players new what map it was, like in chess, nothing would be random at all

2010-11-17T00:32:58  <antimatroid> varying maps are way more interesting than solving a given map
2010-11-17T00:33:28  <burny> for sure
2010-11-17T00:33:30  <mega1> yes
2010-11-17T00:33:33  <krokkrok> a game that cannot be judged fairly is not a game anymore, its just a beauty pageant
2010-11-17T00:33:42  <Mjothitnir> playing a "solved" game is not AI, its a table lookup
2010-11-17T00:33:43  <amstan> janzert: you have to click test users permissions in their profile, then on top of the page next to "User Control Panel (0 new messages) • View your posts ]" there should be a "revert permissions" link too
2010-11-17T00:33:53  <antimatroid> so all sports are beauty pagents?
2010-11-17T00:33:54  <burny> a single unknown map, isn't fair, for sure
2010-11-17T00:34:00  <krokkrok> anitimatroid: indeed
2010-11-17T00:34:07  <krokkrok> do you even follow sports???
2010-11-17T00:34:12  <mega1> krokkrok: I sympathize with that statement but you can still do measurements with some uncertainty
2010-11-17T00:34:17  <antimatroid> depends on the sport
2010-11-17T00:34:25  <antimatroid> i skateboard and play what you would probabyl call field hockey
2010-11-17T00:34:27  <burny> fairest would be if every pair of bots, played on a list of 100ish different maps
2010-11-17T00:34:47  <mega1> burny: that's the N*N*M solution that infeasible
2010-11-17T00:34:52  <mega1> that's
2010-11-17T00:34:57  <mega1> can't type at all
2010-11-17T00:35:27  <janzert> amstan: hmm, yeah I do that (click on the test users permissions) and it sends me to the information page with successfully transferred permissions... but before I didn't get the link for restore permission for some reason
2010-11-17T00:35:32  <janzert> this time it worked
2010-11-17T00:35:36  <mega1> the system that stands a chance is N*N on a random map
2010-11-17T00:35:37  <krokkrok> what is feasible is use random match ELO to find an appromiation of the top 100 bots, then 100*100*m.
2010-11-17T00:35:43  <amstan> janzert: now there should be no post button
2010-11-17T00:35:53  <Mjothitnir> not to be picky but isn't that n(n-1)/2
2010-11-17T00:35:56  <janzert> yep, it went away
2010-11-17T00:36:02  <amstan> janzert: decent
2010-11-17T00:36:10  <antimatroid> what are the chances of us getting a top x round robin right at the end amstan and janzert?
2010-11-17T00:36:10  <amstan> janzert: now we have to transfer a bunch of discussions in there
2010-11-17T00:36:19  <amstan> antimatroid: we'll probably do it
2010-11-17T00:36:23  <amstan> antimatroid: we did it before
2010-11-17T00:36:28  <mega1> Mjothitnir: yes, but that's a constant in my big-O
2010-11-17T00:36:31  <janzert> amstan: yep looks like it's working now
2010-11-17T00:36:31  <mega1> almost
2010-11-17T00:36:40  <krokkrok> however, my point is really this, as I said on the forums: next time, pick a game that can be perfectly and fairly judged, make that a criteria of the game choice
2010-11-17T00:36:41  <antimatroid> ah okay, i totally don't remember it
2010-11-17T00:36:51  <janzert> antimatroid: I don't think it will be necessary but we'll see
2010-11-17T00:37:17  <mega1> krokkrok: there is value in the random maps even if they just totally dropped the ball on this one
2010-11-17T00:37:17  <Mjothitnir> we are not dealing with billion+ n's and m's so big-o is a pile of crap
2010-11-17T00:37:36  <burny> or for bot's different in ELO rank by X, have them play min(3, 100-x/2) maps, or so

2010-11-17T00:38:09  <janzert> I hope to run the main tournament until the likelihood of superiority is above 95% for at least each adjoining pair of bots
2010-11-17T00:38:18  <janzert> but we'll see how that goes
2010-11-17T00:38:19  <mega1> krokkrok: what's your M?

2010-11-17T00:38:42  <krokkrok> hello my friend!
2010-11-17T00:38:47  <mega1> hell, no
2010-11-17T00:38:50  <antimatroid> it would be good if a few different ranking methods were tried following the contest to see how each seems to do
2010-11-17T00:38:51  <mega1> better? ;-)
2010-11-17T00:39:12  <mega1> the fewer the maps the greater the variance
2010-11-17T00:39:29  <krokkrok> only if they are kept secret
2010-11-17T00:39:39  <antimatroid> and i mean more about map variety than anything
2010-11-17T00:39:47  <Mjothitnir> at the current servers rate/24hrs (~120000) 100 players eat through ~12 maps per day
2010-11-17T00:39:53  <krokkrok> but again, i think this contest is already hosed, so I am more concerned about the next
2010-11-17T00:40:11  <antimatroid> krokkrok: your idea of a perfect competition sounds very dull to me :)
2010-11-17T00:40:54  <krokkrok> why is correct judging dull? you want bias? isnt that what you are trying to remove from the maps?? why bother??
2010-11-17T00:41:20  <mega1> Mjothitnir: I'm not sure that's better than generating a new random map for each match
2010-11-17T00:41:22  <antimatroid> i want general
2010-11-17T00:41:29  <antimatroid> i will try to minise bias around that

2010-11-17T00:41:49  <krokkrok> it *cannot* be general animatroid.  this is the crux of my point.  this contest is entirely subjective
2010-11-17T00:42:04  <sigh> krokkrok: the dullness comes from optimizing for a special case
2010-11-17T00:42:13  <mega1> krokkrok: it wasn't until they started tuning the generator
2010-11-17T00:42:49  <krokkrok> the problem is built into the nature of the contest, it cannot be avoided.  the ordering is objectively unstable
2010-11-17T00:42:52  <mega1> true, the final results are a bit random but it wasn't subjective
2010-11-17T00:43:08  <mega1> the ranking is stable in the limit
2010-11-17T00:43:19  <burny> the randomess of maps, is part of the contest

2010-11-17T00:43:34  <antimatroid> not everyone was working under restrictions of the old generator, so the rankings would have again been "subjective"
2010-11-17T00:43:37  <krokkrok> it is subjective, it depends on the exact bots that enter the contest; there are always bots not entered that can radically change the outcome
2010-11-17T00:43:45  <burny> the only thing I don't like about this, is that I think it would actually be semi easy to write a 'perfect' AI
2010-11-17T00:43:55  <antimatroid> you're wrong :P
2010-11-17T00:43:57  <mega1> krokkrok: yes, as with chess
2010-11-17T00:44:12  <krokkrok> yes, as with chess!
2010-11-17T00:44:34  <antimatroid> any contest is always going to be subjective yes?
2010-11-17T00:44:36  <janzert> krokkrok: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subjective that's really what you mean?
2010-11-17T00:44:37  <krokkrok> what we are doing, actually, is acting like elks in their mating ritual hehe
2010-11-17T00:44:41  <mega1> I thought that kind of shoots down your argument.
2010-11-17T00:44:44  <burny> krok, the winning bot is that one that should probably win the most games, on any unknown random map
2010-11-17T00:44:56  <krokkrok> no, any contest is not subjective, a footrace is not subjective
2010-11-17T00:45:06  <antimatroid> it doesn't help that everyone has a different meaning of what "ai" means
2010-11-17T00:45:30  <antimatroid> meaning/understanding whatever
2010-11-17T00:45:34  <sigh> krokkrok: so basically ruling out any contest where your opponent's actions affect your outcome?
2010-11-17T00:45:37  <burny> for my definition: the rules make ai not possible to do
2010-11-17T00:45:39  <mega1> krokkrok: please come up with a fair way to create rankings in absence of a total order between players
2010-11-17T00:46:14  <krokkrok> dont play games that dont have total order
2010-11-17T00:46:14  <burny> I want to program in the rules, some huristics, and make the ai learn how it's opponents play, to balance the huristics
2010-11-17T00:46:26  <antimatroid> sigh: those are not games
2010-11-17T00:46:33  <antimatroid> they're decision problems and performance rankings
2010-11-17T00:46:34  <sigh> antimatroid: I know
2010-11-17T00:46:47  <sigh> *I agree
2010-11-17T00:46:54  <antimatroid> krokkrok: mario ai challenge would probably do you well
2010-11-17T00:46:55  <krokkrok> the list of possible future games does list a game that fits this critera, so, yeah, these are games too
2010-11-17T00:47:04  <sigh> but that is what krokkrok is advocating
2010-11-17T00:47:06  <antimatroid> that's a decision problem for you :)
2010-11-17T00:47:14  <burny> krok, if there are 5 players, and player1 beats 3 people, but the person who beats player1 losesr to everyone else.. who should win?
2010-11-17T00:47:45  <krokkrok> no r/s/p..like a footrace, absolute numbers
2010-11-17T00:47:56  <antimatroid> a footrace is not a game
2010-11-17T00:48:04  <krokkrok> sure it is
2010-11-17T00:48:07  <antimatroid> no it's not
2010-11-17T00:48:20  <krokkrok> semantics
2010-11-17T00:48:21  <burny> how could this contest possibly be changed, to be footrace like?
2010-11-17T00:48:24  <antimatroid> well, okay, but it's not a game where players actions affect the others
2010-11-17T00:48:34  <krokkrok> this contest cannot be changed.  the next one can
2010-11-17T00:48:44  <antimatroid> to a decision problem?
2010-11-17T00:48:47  <burny> assuming it OCULD be changed.. how could it?
2010-11-17T00:48:47  <antimatroid> that's so boring
2010-11-17T00:48:50  <sigh> burny: single player, conquer all planets as fast as possible with a known planet
2010-11-17T00:48:54  <sigh> but yes, not as intersting
2010-11-17T00:48:59  <sigh> *known map
2010-11-17T00:49:00  <krokkrok> correct, if players actions can affect others, you get cheating and collusion and occlusion
2010-11-17T00:49:11  <burny> conquer all planets as fast as possible can be solved with brute force
2010-11-17T00:49:13  <antimatroid> you don't get collusion for 2 player zreo sum games
2010-11-17T00:49:15  <burny> very easily
2010-11-17T00:49:15  <antimatroid> there is no point

2010-11-17T00:51:21  <burny> how so?
2010-11-17T00:51:28  <antimatroid> bumps your win percentage
2010-11-17T00:51:32  <krokkrok> i can feed ELO to my friends
2010-11-17T00:51:39  <burny> not in a meaningful way

2010-11-17T00:51:52  <McLeopold_> actually, with bayeselo, it's harder to do that than you think
2010-11-17T00:51:57  <antimatroid> krokkrok: you can't have an interesting game where that isn't really possible
2010-11-17T00:52:00  <krokkrok> easy as pie man
2010-11-17T00:52:14  <krokkrok> antimatroid; yes you cna
2010-11-17T00:52:16  <krokkrok> *can
2010-11-17T00:52:16  <antimatroid> when the game is "pretty much decided" you message each other, then give the desired result
2010-11-17T00:52:17  <antimatroid> pretty easy
2010-11-17T00:52:18  <burny> if you have a 10th place bot.. and you have a friend submit the exact same bot(with some minor frig-ups to throw hte game for you)..
2010-11-17T00:52:22  <krokkrok> it can be done. just think about it.
2010-11-17T00:52:25  <burny> that bot won't be top 100 most likely
2010-11-17T00:52:53  <burny> and you gettignto beat that 100th place bot for free.. won't help your ranking, cause everyone else(that matters) will also beat it
2010-11-17T00:53:16  <antimatroid> burny: you "message" each other once the match is already winnable by someone, then whoever has the higher ranking forfeits the game
2010-11-17T00:53:20  <krokkrok> ok, I cannot teach you right now how to properly cheat, I can only inform you that indeed, collusion can be used and it can easily change the outcome
2010-11-17T00:53:21  <antimatroid> it would be pretty easy to implement
2010-11-17T00:53:31  <sigh> yeah, just encode signal in first move order
2010-11-17T00:53:37  <virdo> contest organizers can inspect the source code ;)
2010-11-17T00:53:37  <antimatroid> no, first move is too important
2010-11-17T00:53:42  <antimatroid> do it once the game is "decided"
2010-11-17T00:53:45  <burny> how do they know what their ranking is?

2010-11-17T00:54:11  <krokkrok> they dont need to know what  their ranking is
2010-11-17T00:54:11  <antimatroid> the one with the highest gets to win
2010-11-17T00:54:17  <antimatroid> people have been over this in the forums
2010-11-17T00:54:25  <burny> no... how do you know YOUR ranking?
2010-11-17T00:54:26  <burny> oh..
2010-11-17T00:54:31  <krokkrok> you dont
2010-11-17T00:54:32  <burny> you mean like.. to submit 10 of the same bot?
2010-11-17T00:54:36  <krokkrok> its not necessary
2010-11-17T00:54:40  <antimatroid> the rankings are prespecified
2010-11-17T00:54:40  <krokkrok> or a thousand!
2010-11-17T00:54:47  <burny> and instead of getting 10th place..
2010-11-17T00:54:48  <Mjothitnir> if the two bots areexactly the same shouldn't they be making the same moves (and so are decernable with out special "bad moves")
2010-11-17T00:54:54  <burny> you'll get 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, etc.?
2010-11-17T00:55:09  <krokkrok> the question is this: can someone cheat without being detected?
2010-11-17T00:55:22  <antimatroid> Mjorthitnir: you could have large groups of people colluding, with a defined preference ordering of who gets to win
2010-11-17T00:55:25  <antimatroid> it's very unlikely
2010-11-17T00:55:37  <antimatroid> and the source can be inspected for the winning bots
2010-11-17T00:55:37  <antimatroid> it'
2010-11-17T00:55:37  <virdo> antimatroid: how large? that's the question ;)
2010-11-17T00:55:38  <burny> my proposition.. is that someone can't cheat in a meaningful way, without being detected
2010-11-17T00:55:50  <sigh> krokkrok: even then, people put up with that risk for a more interesting competition
2010-11-17T00:55:51  <burny> the only way I can see of, to cheat without being detected..
2010-11-17T00:55:53  <antimatroid> i'm just pointing out that it can be one, i don't think it'd work very well
2010-11-17T00:56:04  <krokkrok> think evil.  lets say you wanted to win an ai contest.  be a judge. then, run the bots in secret [like this contest] and then only show the ones where your bot wins!
2010-11-17T00:56:19  <burny> is to have a very good bot, that throws the match to all weak players, and plays well against top100 players.. but also throws it against you
2010-11-17T00:56:22  <krokkrok> antimatroid: i know it can work well, this is how WOW players get gladiator titles
2010-11-17T00:56:27  <antimatroid> krokkrok: if you don't trust the organisers of any contest, there's no point being there
2010-11-17T00:56:38  <antimatroid> i don't really play video games
2010-11-17T00:56:44  <antimatroid> excluding flash games and minesweeper
2010-11-17T00:56:57  <krokkrok> yes i can tell, you are not a gamer and thus don't know all the ways to cheat
2010-11-17T00:57:20  <sigh> krokkrok: the simple fact is that there is a very large class of interesting games that people want to play, which you wish to exclude
2010-11-17T00:57:34  <krokkrok> ah, well, the definition of interesting comes into play
2010-11-17T00:57:39  <burny> krok, if the top 10 people beat you.. then they'll also beat your colluders
2010-11-17T00:57:46  <burny> so it doesn't REALLY matter
2010-11-17T00:58:03  <krokkrok> it does matter
2010-11-17T00:58:12  <krokkrok> because its not a>b>c, its hightest ELO score
2010-11-17T00:58:15  <sigh> that is subjective, but the point is that we want a competition that will cater to these type of games
2010-11-17T00:58:23  <burny> unless you cheat in a HUGE way.. it won't make much difference
2010-11-17T00:58:36  <krokkrok> when cheating, go big, thats what I say
2010-11-17T00:58:36  <burny> ELO score is NOT being used for final score krok
2010-11-17T00:58:56  <Mjothitnir> what is then
2010-11-17T00:58:59  <krokkrok> it doesnt even have to be ELO, simply win ratio

2010-11-17T00:59:31  <krokkrok> i have to go now, but I ask you this; can you create a game that meets our monkey-brain desire for 'interesting' and yet is still mathematically sound?
2010-11-17T00:59:34  <antimatroid> it would be very hard to cheat in a way that actually placed you right at the top
2010-11-17T00:59:40  <antimatroid> and be undetected
2010-11-17T00:59:47  <krokkrok> it is not hard to cheat undetected. trust me

2010-11-17T01:01:13  <burny> and who cares.. without hard-core cheating.. you can't bump up your rank by more than about 10%
2010-11-17T01:02:07  <burny> unless you like.. enter 10million bots that play mostly randomly.. and hope one of them gets real lucky

2010-11-17T01:03:08  <burny> it's fairly easy to detect cheating though, with huristics
2010-11-17T01:03:43  <burny> stuff like.. is there any 2 bots that have more than 90% similarity in the compiled byte code?
2010-11-17T01:03:50  <sigh> I'm tempted to try this theory out on tcp :)
2010-11-17T01:04:03  <antimatroid> hehe
2010-11-17T01:04:09  <burny> what theory? my theory about it not mattering?
2010-11-17T01:04:09  <antimatroid> i'd be interested to see the games
2010-11-17T01:04:13  <antimatroid> signaling
2010-11-17T01:04:18  <sigh> tcp it is easier, you are told who are playing before the game
2010-11-17T01:04:46  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm going out to socialise for a few hours, it's been a while
2010-11-17T01:04:59  <sigh> actually
2010-11-17T01:05:05  <burny> unless the level of randomness in your AI is fairly high..
2010-11-17T01:05:07  <Mjothitnir> what is "socialise"
2010-11-17T01:05:21  <burny> you're going to beat the same 80 people, and lose to the same 20 people, on both(or very nearly the same)..
2010-11-17T01:05:43  <burny> and so having one of them throw the game to your other one.. doesn't increase your rank in any substantial way
2010-11-17T01:05:49  <antimatroid> $10 beer and burger
2010-11-17T01:05:57  <Mjothitnir> :)
2010-11-17T01:07:32  <burny> I hope for final though, if it is using a ranking like ELO.. that it will be a multi-pass ranking

2010-11-17T01:07:47  <burny> since bots won't be 'getting better and worse' as per real life people,
2010-11-17T01:07:57  <antimatroid> i'd be fairly happy with the way rankings are done now tbh
2010-11-17T01:08:38  <burny> if someone loses their second game, to a weak player(who got lucky in their first game), it will lower their rank
2010-11-17T01:08:55  <burny> similarly the other way around
2010-11-17T01:09:10  <burny> all you have to do, is have multi-pass ranking..
2010-11-17T01:09:36  <burny> after preliminary rankings are made: re-apply the same game's from the preliminary ranking..
2010-11-17T01:09:57  <burny> and tell every opponent that their rank is prelim(but adjust their new 'real' rank)
2010-11-17T01:10:07  <burny> repeat until the ranks don't change
2010-11-17T01:10:15  <janzert> burny: all the games are taken into account each time the rankings are run
2010-11-17T01:10:30  <burny> yes, but the order the games happen in, matters
2010-11-17T01:10:32  <janzert> bayeselo isn't a simple iterative elo calculation
2010-11-17T01:10:35  <burny> which is fine in RL
2010-11-17T01:10:49  <janzert> only in that it effects who you play next
2010-11-17T01:11:12  <burny> if a crummier bot beat a good bot, when they were all ranked 1000..
2010-11-17T01:11:26  <burny> then the crummy bot's ranking will not have gone up significantly
2010-11-17T01:11:27  <janzert> you can feed it the same set of games in any order you want and it will turn out the same rankings
2010-11-17T01:12:03  <burny> ok, 4 people 4 games...

2010-11-17T01:17:25  <McLeopold_> game order does not matter
2010-11-17T01:17:36  <burny> yes it does

2010-11-17T01:18:01  <McLeopold_> In regular Elo it does, In glicko, it does, but not in BayesElo
2010-11-17T01:18:10  <burny> the order doesn't matter in conjunction with the opponents ranking AT THE TIME..
2010-11-17T01:18:27  <burny> but the opponents ranking 'at the time' in this contest.. is wrong, quite often
2010-11-17T01:19:12  <McLeopold_> it appears that way because they aren't showing the confidence ranges.
2010-11-17T01:19:38  <burny> if my 3500rank bot takes 5 games to climb from 1000 to 3500(winning 4/5).. the person who beat me, will not be credited with a 3500point win

2010-11-17T01:20:54  <burny> the reason ELO works for something like.. chess.. and car racing... is because people "get better".. or have "off days" etc.
2010-11-17T01:21:00  <McLeopold_> I repeat, it does not matter what your rank is when you play someone.  The entire result set is calculated every time.
2010-11-17T01:21:01  <janzert> burny: can you give me a corrected above example that you think causes the problem?
2010-11-17T01:21:07  <janzert> x
2010-11-17T01:21:27  <McLeopold_> Elo for chess is different, rank does matter at the time of match.
2010-11-17T01:21:35  <burny> I don't think the differences will be significant.. but they could be
2010-11-17T01:21:35  <McLeopold_> This is BayesElo, not the same.

2010-11-17T01:39:17  <janzert> btw, burny here is how bayeselo comes out with your example above http://pastebin.ca/1994212
2010-11-17T01:39:58  <janzert> it seems ok even though there are really too few games to really tell much there of course :)
2010-11-17T01:40:24  <janzert> but it should help demonstrate that bayeselo doesn't care about the order of games

2010-11-17T01:42:41  <McLeopold_> Accoun: and I can't tell when there is a new submission based on name.
2010-11-17T01:43:35  <Accoun> McLeopold_> yes, if all users will be change name for new versions
2010-11-17T01:43:53  <janzert> burny: also note that this is the competition version of bayeselo that is modified not to give a first player advantage by default
2010-11-17T01:43:55  <McLeopold_> Accoun: but I can't enforce that
2010-11-17T01:44:11  <janzert> if you download a standard bayeselo you need to set advantage to 0
2010-11-17T01:44:17  <McLeopold_> Accoun: I could rank by elo - the lower confidence
2010-11-17T01:44:29  <McLeopold_> Then only established bots will be ranked high.
2010-11-17T01:44:48  <janzert> Whole History Rating would be better for TCP servers
2010-11-17T01:44:59  <janzert> but someone would have to implement it of course
2010-11-17T01:45:13  <McLeopold_> janzert: do you know the bayeselo commands for that?
2010-11-17T01:45:31  <janzert> IIRC, it's just "advantage 0" in the elo mode

2010-11-17T01:47:04  <janzert> I'd try it without, after mm and before mm to see what difference it makes if any
2010-11-17T01:47:43  <janzert> advantage with no number after it should show you what the current setting is
2010-11-17T01:51:30  <janzert> McLeopold_: did you get a chance to test the radius distribution?
2010-11-17T01:51:46  <McLeopold_> yeah, I'm still looking at the graph
2010-11-17T01:51:49  <janzert> ok
2010-11-17T01:51:53  <McLeopold_> I'm pretty sure a log is more correct
2010-11-17T01:51:59  <McLeopold_> I just have to find the best formula
2010-11-17T01:52:28  <Accoun> need to generate new map for eath game
2010-11-17T01:52:34  <janzert> we basically need a linear distribution right?
2010-11-17T01:52:48  <Accoun> or genetate over 999 map as alternative
2010-11-17T01:53:17  <janzert> Accoun: I'm pretty sure I went over that with you the other day, so I'm not going to rehash it again now
2010-11-17T01:53:31  <Zannick> janzert: i'd suggest just doing the same random selection as the original generator, then convert to r, theta
2010-11-17T01:54:31  <janzert> Zannick: I'm debating whether to even make a distribution change :/
2010-11-17T01:54:52  <janzert> maxRadius and fixing maximum planets are the only sure changes

2010-11-17T01:56:18  <burny> janz, I think it should be that way because A lost to a better player, and C beat a better player
2010-11-17T01:56:42  <Zannick> overall, but there are a good handful of starting clusters
2010-11-17T01:57:20  <burny> but from the looks of that page you linked, adn the lack of math on the internet.. I think the bayesan is working basically the way I was sugesting
2010-11-17T01:57:31  <janzert> the overall is probably because the radius is too small I would think right?
2010-11-17T01:57:43  <Zannick> i suspect that plays a factor
2010-11-17T01:57:48  <mega1> I check the sqrt random radius thing and it's correct
2010-11-17T01:57:51  <mega1> *checked
2010-11-17T01:57:59  <janzert> the maps are basically only 1/4 the size
2010-11-17T01:58:05  <janzert> with up to twice the planets
2010-11-17T01:58:07  <Zannick> really?
2010-11-17T01:58:12  <janzert> Zannick: yes
2010-11-17T01:58:21  <Zannick> i thought it was only slightly more than 3/4 the size

2010-11-17T01:59:49  <burny> where the olny way to beat it, is to add some randomness, or to make your bot, assume it is playing against that particular bot?
2010-11-17T01:59:52  <mega1> when was it?
2010-11-17T02:00:02  <janzert> Zannick: you're right, they're 1/4 smaller :P
2010-11-17T02:00:36  <janzert> mega1: The number of maps thing?
2010-11-17T02:00:40  <mega1> yes
2010-11-17T02:01:03  <janzert> mega1: probably somewhere in this past Friday to Saturday
2010-11-17T02:01:32  <janzert> although I'm pretty sure I've seen antimatroid going over it since then as well
2010-11-17T02:01:53  <janzert> so it might have been earlier and I'm remembering that one as the recent one
2010-11-17T02:02:01  <mega1> yes we had a discussion too. What Accoun says makes sense to me.
2010-11-17T02:02:54  <mega1> depends on how many games we can expect to play in the finals
2010-11-17T02:03:40  <janzert> basically having a small set of maps keeps a large number of different bots playing on it so you get a good rating across those games basically
2010-11-17T02:04:26  <McLeopold_> janzert: power( rand() , 0.630929 )
2010-11-17T02:04:41  <McLeopold_> so closer to sqrt than log
2010-11-17T02:04:52  <mega1> small set of maps is the best way to introduce a lot of randomness into the ratings
2010-11-17T02:04:55  <janzert> McLeopold_: is there any math behind that number or just testing?
2010-11-17T02:05:01  <McLeopold_> just testing
2010-11-17T02:05:08  <McLeopold_> but kinda math
2010-11-17T02:05:22  <McLeopold_> the number is trial and error, but I don't understand it
2010-11-17T02:06:09  <McLeopold_> It means that the set of radii from 0 - 0.5 are 1/3 as likely as the set from 0.5 - 1
2010-11-17T02:06:34  <McLeopold_> that property holds with with any 0-x and x - 3x
2010-11-17T02:06:40  <mega1> There are maps on which I lose very often. The fewer maps there are the greater the chance of getting a very favorable or very bad set of maps.
2010-11-17T02:06:56  <McLeopold_> mega1: yes, it shouldn't be purely random
2010-11-17T02:07:21  <McLeopold_> There should be a good analysis of different map types so there is a good set of different types of maps
2010-11-17T02:07:24  <janzert> yes, there is a tension with that and the rating between a large number and a small number
2010-11-17T02:07:44  <mega1> I'm sorry?
2010-11-17T02:07:56  <mega1> large and small number?
2010-11-17T02:08:07  <burny> of maps
2010-11-17T02:08:20  <McLeopold_> basically, we want uniform randomness

2010-11-17T02:08:23  <burny> small number of maps = not accurate ratings, large number = takes long time
2010-11-17T02:08:32  <janzert> large number of maps to ensure a good distribution over all possible maps and small number of maps to help the ratings otu
2010-11-17T02:08:40  <McLeopold_> yep
2010-11-17T02:08:56  <McLeopold_> But, how do you make sure you don't have different map types?
2010-11-17T02:09:03  <McLeopold_> or, do have different map types
2010-11-17T02:09:07  <mega1> I believe the maps are the bigger source of randomness.
2010-11-17T02:09:45  <mega1> It's hard to make a representative sample with 30 maps.
2010-11-17T02:10:09  <McLeopold_> if we could take 2 maps, and calc their similarity
2010-11-17T02:10:20  <McLeopold_> we could ensure no 2 maps are too similar in style
2010-11-17T02:10:36  <McLeopold_> kinda like making sure planets are not too close
2010-11-17T02:10:37  <mega1> you can cluster them by results
2010-11-17T02:10:39  <janzert> mega1: I admit the 30 maps was a bit of a test, it's what I consider the extreme low end
2010-11-17T02:10:52  <burny> if 'most' maps end up having the starting locations be far from each other, I think that should have been part of the original problem description.. although I also think stating planets near each other is nearly always a draw
2010-11-17T02:11:19  <mega1> as Mjothitnir calculated at the current rate 12 maps for a top 100 round robin takes a day
2010-11-17T02:11:43  <burny> shouldn't need a full 100
2010-11-17T02:11:50  <McLeopold_> we need to calculate a few different dimensions of maps, then ensure no 2 maps have the same values for all dimenseions
2010-11-17T02:12:01  <McLeopold_> starting distance is a big factor, so that should be one
2010-11-17T02:12:23  <burny> doing a full round robin with the nearest 10 should be sufficient.. and half of the maps for nearest 20, and 30% for nearest 30, etc.
2010-11-17T02:12:39  <mega1> you must take a representative sample from the generator
2010-11-17T02:12:43  <McLeopold_> the cluster factor of a map could be another
2010-11-17T02:12:59  <mega1> if you start applying heuristics you're very likely to distort it significantly
2010-11-17T02:13:22  <McLeopold_> mega1: but if we can think of the most important factors, it will help
2010-11-17T02:13:43  <burny> the best way to get a representative sample from a infintely large random population..
2010-11-17T02:13:52  <burny> is to take a large random sample
2010-11-17T02:13:54  <McLeopold_> umm: I'm trying to take a representative sample from the generator
2010-11-17T02:14:07  <mega1> that's almost infinite
2010-11-17T02:14:46  <burny> with no huristics
2010-11-17T02:15:04  <burny> or: use huristics just to determine how large that sample should be
2010-11-17T02:15:54  <janzert> McLeopold_: going back to radius distribution, the chance of a number should be weighted by the number itself gives the correct distribution.
2010-11-17T02:16:17  <McLeopold_> ?
2010-11-17T02:16:18  <burny> if player A is vastly better than player B.. but B always beats A on a certain type of map.. and that map type only shows up say, 3% of the time. if it exists 3times in a set of 30.. is that bad?
2010-11-17T02:16:32  <Mjothitnir> or you create a list of the possible "types" and have the generator create maps of each type.
2010-11-17T02:16:34  <mega1> the current code sqrt(random.random()) code is correct
2010-11-17T02:17:05  <mega1> we already have types: line a point symmetric
2010-11-17T02:17:12  <mega1> and
2010-11-17T02:17:17  <McLeopold_> mega1: I think it is power( rand() , 0.63.. )
2010-11-17T02:17:25  <burny> is it against the rules to abuse known facts about the RNG being used, and the map generation code?
2010-11-17T02:17:29  <McLeopold_> mega1: what's your reasoning?

2010-11-17T02:17:47  <mega1> McLeopold_: I plotted a sample of 1000 random points generated by it
2010-11-17T02:17:58  <Accoun> stupid rules if u can change winer without changing rules
2010-11-17T02:18:02  <mega1> looked at a roughly uniform distribution in a circle
2010-11-17T02:18:15  <burny> eg. there's 4billion possible seeds, and I know that 7% of those 4billion maps have some trait(even though only 3% of the total population has that), then the AI should favor that trait slightly
2010-11-17T02:18:22  <mega1> trivially follows from ratios of areas of circles
2010-11-17T02:18:54  <McLeopold_> it think it should be circumference, not area
2010-11-17T02:19:01  <mega1> why?
2010-11-17T02:19:10  <mega1> what kind of uniform distribution do we want?
2010-11-17T02:19:18  <McLeopold_> because we are dealing with points, not area
2010-11-17T02:19:41  <janzert> this is the chance of placing it on any particular circumference
2010-11-17T02:19:58  <burny> circle has smaller area, smaller average distance, and smaller maximum distance, than a square of equal circumfrance
2010-11-17T02:20:10  <mega1> what I think we want that the expected number of planets in any region is linearly proportional to its area
2010-11-17T02:20:15  <Mjothitnir> "types" is more than just symmetry (point/line), but number of planets, radius, spacing, etc
2010-11-17T02:20:28  <burny> er, no it doesn't..
2010-11-17T02:20:41  <janzert> mega1: right so we need the chance of placing at radius to be half that of placing it at radius 2
2010-11-17T02:20:48  <mega1> no
2010-11-17T02:20:52  <burny> ya, I agree.. circumfrance is likely better over all(for preserving traits of the old maps dimensions)
2010-11-17T02:21:18  <mega1> take two circles
2010-11-17T02:21:33  <janzert> if the map is quantized to integer radius I'm positive that is right
2010-11-17T02:21:43  <mega1> one with r1=r and with r2=2*r
2010-11-17T02:21:52  <janzert> I'm not quite sure it holds for a smooth radius
2010-11-17T02:22:01  <mega1> the area of the larger is 4 times that of the smaller
2010-11-17T02:22:17  <Accoun> need add ELO + - field in "Current Rankings"
2010-11-17T02:22:32  <mega1> hence you want 1/4 chance of producing a radius < r1
2010-11-17T02:22:39  <mega1> that's it.
2010-11-17T02:23:57  <McLeopold_> hmm
2010-11-17T02:24:15  <janzert> mega1: say they can be placed at r 1-4
2010-11-17T02:24:17  <mega1> but as I said I had also plotted the generated points
2010-11-17T02:25:53  <janzert> placing 10 planets on it on average by my method above places the same number of planets on each radii as the radius is
2010-11-17T02:26:04  <janzert> your property also holds
2010-11-17T02:26:13  <janzert> for r1=2
2010-11-17T02:26:38  <janzert> so I think what we said is equivalent for the property you and I want
2010-11-17T02:27:15  <mega1> possibly, I haven't fully internalized your version

2010-11-17T02:54:33  <janzert> http://pastebin.ca/1994268
2010-11-17T02:54:39  <janzert> is my current version
2010-11-17T02:55:10  <mega1> is there no do-while loop in python
2010-11-17T02:55:10  <mega1> ?
2010-11-17T02:55:18  <janzert> no
2010-11-17T02:55:27  <mega1> other than that it's good
2010-11-17T02:55:46  <janzert> it'll break if min_r is less than 0 of course, but I'm not worried about that right now
2010-11-17T02:55:55  <McLeopold_> mega1: for radius 0.5 to radius 1.0, you want about 1/4 of the numbers below 0.5 and 3/4 above?
2010-11-17T02:56:05  <mega1> yes
2010-11-17T02:56:58  <burny> the easiest way to generate a equally-distributed random point in a circle..
2010-11-17T02:57:13  <burny> is to generate 2 points, until x*x+y*y < r*r
2010-11-17T02:57:16  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.91.14> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-17T02:57:33  <McLeopold_> so, a random number of 0.25 should map to 0.5
2010-11-17T02:58:16  <mega1> yes, conveniently sqrt(0.25)=0.5 :-)
2010-11-17T02:59:35  <McLeopold_> okay then, sqrt it is
2010-11-17T02:59:48  <janzert> Yay. One last thing to sort out
2010-11-17T02:59:59  <janzert> Unfortunately this truly is a bit subjective
2010-11-17T03:00:12  <mega1> uh-oh
2010-11-17T03:00:20  * burny is the master of removing subjection frm subjective topics
2010-11-17T03:00:21  <janzert> mega1: yeah no kidding
2010-11-17T03:00:38  <Mjothitnir> muh-hahahahaha
2010-11-17T03:00:43  <mega1> (lavalamp's map gen: http://pastebin.com/zBafpvuM, just to diff against)
2010-11-17T03:01:02  <janzert> Should the new maps have the same average density of planets (i.e. same area) or the same maximum distance or a compromise between the two?
2010-11-17T03:01:28  <McLeopold_> so, box or circle?
2010-11-17T03:01:29  <burny> it depends on the original problem description
2010-11-17T03:01:38  <mega1> what did the original generator do?
2010-11-17T03:01:39  <janzert> burny: it wasn't specified at all
2010-11-17T03:01:57  <mega1> uniform in a square?
2010-11-17T03:02:02  <janzert> the original generator fit all maps within a square with 24 distance on a side
2010-11-17T03:02:05  <burny> then: it should be what creates the most interesting maps..
2010-11-17T03:02:14  <janzert> yes, I believe uniform within that square
2010-11-17T03:02:24  <burny> interesting being: not an obivous stalemate
2010-11-17T03:02:38  <janzert> the new generator does uniform within a circle. currently with max diameter of 24
2010-11-17T03:02:43  <McLeopold_> mega1: that pastebin didn't work for me?
2010-11-17T03:03:01  <janzert> this means the new maps currently are smaller both in area and maximum distance
2010-11-17T03:03:12  <McLeopold_> mega1: because I kept the comma (whoops)
2010-11-17T03:03:12  <mega1> strange, it works for me. Maybe remove the comma at the end
2010-11-17T03:03:13  <janzert> and correspondingly have a higher density
2010-11-17T03:03:36  <burny> janz, I think the squared average distance, should be maintained, rather than the maximum
2010-11-17T03:03:46  <mega1> and for this was the 12->17 change proposed, right?
2010-11-17T03:03:56  <janzert> mega1: yes
2010-11-17T03:04:18  <janzert> maxRadius 17 restores approximately the same maximum distance
2010-11-17T03:04:19  <McLeopold_> well, do we want square or circle?  that has to be answered first
2010-11-17T03:04:22  *** grog <grog!4c58a69c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.76.88.166.156> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-17T03:04:27  <mega1> if I wanted to be "correct" I'd balance the non-overlapping areas of the square and the circle
2010-11-17T03:04:34  <janzert> McLeopold_: I'm not changing it from the current system for that
2010-11-17T03:04:43  <McLeopold_> so circle then?
2010-11-17T03:04:47  <burny> 15.3 would be my recommended radius
2010-11-17T03:04:55  <janzert> McLeopold_: yes
2010-11-17T03:04:56  <mega1> so compute the area of the square that isn't covered by the circle
2010-11-17T03:05:02  <Mjothitnir> changing from circle bound in square (12), to square bound in circle (17)
2010-11-17T03:05:04  <burny> to get the same squared average distance
2010-11-17T03:05:10  <mega1> and compute the area of the circle that isn't covered by square
2010-11-17T03:05:32  <McLeopold_> I think you want the circle with area 24*24
2010-11-17T03:05:33  <Mjothitnir> (same square)
2010-11-17T03:05:36  <janzert> mega1: doesn't that work out to making the same area?
2010-11-17T03:05:37  <mega1> choose R to minimize the difference between the two areas (i.e. make them equal)
2010-11-17T03:06:22  <burny> r=17 circle has more area than a side=24 square
2010-11-17T03:06:37  <janzert> burny: right
2010-11-17T03:06:43  <burny> 13.5 would give same area
2010-11-17T03:06:47  <mega1> janzert: hmm, that's a less scientific way to put it :-)
2010-11-17T03:06:49  <janzert> that's what we are discussing
2010-11-17T03:07:14  <janzert> mega1: just a different way of looking at it again :P
2010-11-17T03:07:23  <mega1> sorry, for overcomplicating it
2010-11-17T03:07:39  <burny> 13.5 would increase the overall relative-density of the planets
2010-11-17T03:07:59  <mega1> I'd also make it a square
2010-11-17T03:08:00  <McLeopold_> for a 23 planet map, it should be the same
2010-11-17T03:08:10  <burny> 15.3 would maintain relative density
2010-11-17T03:08:31  <janzert> I guess I really meant to maintain the density for a 23 planet map sorry
2010-11-17T03:08:35  <McLeopold_> ha, yes square!  Janzert is out voted!
2010-11-17T03:08:49  <mega1> I even know of such a generator.
2010-11-17T03:08:59  <janzert> you'll have to appeal to Jeff to get that change made
2010-11-17T03:09:20  <burny> if you choose 3 random points in a square and circle of equal surface area.. the triangle forced in the square will probably have a larger surface area than teh triangle formed in the circle
2010-11-17T03:09:41  <mega1> but if it has to stay a circle then it is really unclear how to balance distances and area
2010-11-17T03:09:42  <janzert> i.e. I'm not making any wholesale changes of the generator past or future that Jeff doesn't force on me :)
2010-11-17T03:10:29  <McLeopold_> you could do half sqaure, half circle
2010-11-17T03:10:34  <janzert> to be fair to him though he didn't insist on this particular generator at the last change
2010-11-17T03:10:41  <janzert> McLeopold_: heh
2010-11-17T03:10:59  <burny> or oval
2010-11-17T03:11:39  <mega1> so I'd make it slightly larger in area than the square to allow distances to get closer
2010-11-17T03:11:50  <mega1> to the distances in the square.
2010-11-17T03:11:55  <burny> I think that what should be maximized, is the standard deviation, of number of plants captured, on games by top100 bots
2010-11-17T03:12:12  <janzert> mega1: that's the direction I'm leaning
2010-11-17T03:12:19  <mega1> cool
2010-11-17T03:12:33  <burny> whatever radius results in maps having inconsistent number of captured planets, is the best radius for me
2010-11-17T03:12:59  <janzert> in which case 15 may make sense
2010-11-17T03:13:47  <janzert> it's about in the middle of old area and distance as well as overall average density
2010-11-17T03:13:55  <McLeopold_> 14.5
2010-11-17T03:14:03  <McLeopold_> 12 + 17 / 2
2010-11-17T03:14:07  <janzert> and is a nice integer
2010-11-17T03:14:19  <janzert> McLeopold_: farther from average density though
2010-11-17T03:14:21  <McLeopold_> geeze, your generating reals
2010-11-17T03:14:24  <burny> sqrt((12*12+17*17)/2)
2010-11-17T03:14:27  <mega1> but since the number of planets varies asymmetrically around 23
2010-11-17T03:14:30  <mega1> hmm, is that right?
2010-11-17T03:14:47  <McLeopold_> can you make radius a function of number of planets?
2010-11-17T03:14:58  <McLeopold_> or was the point to have different densities?
2010-11-17T03:15:07  <burny> that would cause less variation in density
2010-11-17T03:15:08  <mega1> 15 and 30, almost symmetrical
2010-11-17T03:15:13  <janzert> I think different density was the point
2010-11-17T03:15:33  <McLeopold_> actually, it doesn't matter
2010-11-17T03:15:54  <McLeopold_> unless everything is in the unit circle
2010-11-17T03:16:09  <McLeopold_> for bot tactics that is
2010-11-17T03:16:27  <mega1> it does I think
2010-11-17T03:16:36  <McLeopold_> it just makes the games develop slower with less density
2010-11-17T03:16:47  <McLeopold_> and you want fast games right?
2010-11-17T03:16:53  <burny> density is the same as changes to stating population and growth
2010-11-17T03:17:17  <mega1> since bots may not look ahead until the end of the game this may be a factor
2010-11-17T03:17:21  <burny> if everythign is twice as far away, it's the same as if you had double growth
2010-11-17T03:17:40  <contestbot> Top 10 players: SUA.khb(3680), bocsimacko(3654), bix0r4ever(3552), asavis(3535), protocolocon(3472), dmj111(3457), shangas(3440), _iouri_(3427), george(3416), Xrillo(3410)
2010-11-17T03:17:41  <mega1> but there are more important ones.

2010-11-17T03:18:35  <burny> double distance = double growth and half game duration
2010-11-17T03:18:41  <McLeopold_> hmm, it does matter because of the minimum distances
2010-11-17T03:19:08  <burny> oh yes, double average distance also halves the minimum distance
2010-11-17T03:19:16  <McLeopold_> yep

2010-11-17T03:19:56  <McLeopold_> janzert: so I would go closer to 17 than 12
2010-11-17T03:20:12  <burny> need it to win atleast one, so I have a clue of what lvl it's at
2010-11-17T03:20:38  <janzert> McLeopold_: so 15 right? :P
2010-11-17T03:20:44  <burny> I vote 15.3
2010-11-17T03:20:55  <janzert> mega1: the generator you posted earlier is the one in svn?
2010-11-17T03:20:58  <McLeopold_> Yeah...I take my time.  15 is probably good
2010-11-17T03:21:01  <burny> if you want new maps to be as similar as possibel to old maps: but be round instead of square
2010-11-17T03:21:01  <janzert> at least it seems to be
2010-11-17T03:21:27  <McLeopold_> janzert: what about the clustering of planets.  Isn't there a bias in the generator?
2010-11-17T03:21:29  <mega1> no, it's the svn version + two fixes suggested by antimatroid and implemented by lavalamp
2010-11-17T03:21:35  <mega1> as far as I know
2010-11-17T03:21:46  <McLeopold_> I implemented the same changes on my server.
2010-11-17T03:21:47  <mega1> (there is another one below it)
2010-11-17T03:22:31  <mega1> fantistic, just lost to aibot_current_dev -93 elo
2010-11-17T03:23:36  <janzert> Oh, I see it does have the max planet fix and changes the radius to 17
2010-11-17T03:23:39  <burny> so I lose 3/3, and another bot loses 5/15.. but I'm ranked above it(it beat me)
2010-11-17T03:24:05  <McLeopold_> the max planet fix was wrong though
2010-11-17T03:24:11  <burny> nm, my ratign just droped more(without playing more games)
2010-11-17T03:24:30  <janzert> burny none of the servers update rating after every game
2010-11-17T03:24:33  <burny> for sure the ELO re-adjusts as games are played
2010-11-17T03:24:33  <McLeopold_> which we already discussed tonight
2010-11-17T03:24:55  <McLeopold_> burny: are you on zeroviz?
2010-11-17T03:24:56  <janzert> but only every so often after a fixed interval
2010-11-17T03:25:02  <burny> zeroviz?
2010-11-17T03:25:12  <McLeopold_> the tcp server
2010-11-17T03:25:17  <burny> jan: ahhh
2010-11-17T03:25:38  <burny> it seemed to change after each game, but maybe it was laged behind(and the first one, was what it was before any game)
2010-11-17T03:26:10  <janzert> although I guess I haven't actually looked at the tcp code
2010-11-17T03:26:25  <janzert> it's just my understanding that it operates that way the same as the contest server
2010-11-17T03:26:34  <McLeopold_> mine does once a minute
2010-11-17T03:26:52  <McLeopold_> dhartmei wrong a script that I assume runs at a similar interval
2010-11-17T03:26:55  <McLeopold_> wrote
2010-11-17T03:27:19  <burny> roughly what rank does ragebot get?
2010-11-17T03:27:25  <McLeopold_> bad
2010-11-17T03:27:55  <burny> no clue how bad?
2010-11-17T03:28:09  <McLeopold_> -237 on my server
2010-11-17T03:28:32  <burny> I would expect it to beat the sample bot nearly 100% of the time
2010-11-17T03:28:39  <janzert> McLeopold_: I don't see anything that would obviously cause clustering. Also remember true random tends to be more clustered than humans generally think it should be
2010-11-17T03:28:52  <McLeopold_> yes
2010-11-17T03:29:36  <janzert> Is there something specific in the code that is causing skew or is it just from looking at generated maps?
2010-11-17T03:30:03  <McLeopold_> it's the line symmetry ones that looked skewed to me.  I'm reviewing the code
2010-11-17T03:30:22  <McLeopold_> It seems like stuff is always too close to the line
2010-11-17T03:30:24  <mega1> they are always on one side of the center
2010-11-17T03:30:33  <mega1> all of them
2010-11-17T03:30:43  <burny> the center ones you mean?
2010-11-17T03:30:51  <burny> ya.. they're always on the same side of the center
2010-11-17T03:30:56  <burny> as per the code
2010-11-17T03:30:57  <mega1> on one side of the center planet
2010-11-17T03:30:57  <janzert> mega1: that just means center is really the edge right?
2010-11-17T03:31:02  <mega1> no
2010-11-17T03:31:11  <mega1> otherwise it's the center :-)
2010-11-17T03:31:28  <mega1> but the equidistant neutral are thrown to one side
2010-11-17T03:31:34  <burny> it generates in teh range of 0 to r
2010-11-17T03:31:38  <burny> instead of -r to r
2010-11-17T03:32:14  <janzert> mega1: ahh
2010-11-17T03:32:15  <burny> it seems deliberate
2010-11-17T03:32:25  <burny> but I can't imagine why
2010-11-17T03:33:09  <mega1> probably it's the most fair solution
2010-11-17T03:33:11  <burny> unless maybe.. it was intended that the angle is re-generated for each planet
2010-11-17T03:33:28  <mega1> and most general.
2010-11-17T03:33:41  <janzert> mega1: what is?
2010-11-17T03:33:50  <mega1> joking
2010-11-17T03:34:12  <burny> you need to learn to express sarasims on the internet better :P
2010-11-17T03:34:12  <janzert> well stop it :)
2010-11-17T03:34:43  <janzert> I'm just trying to get this done so I can go to bed and let the community bash it before I generate more maps
2010-11-17T03:34:52  <McLeopold_> mega1: yeah, that's it, the center neutrals are always one side of the actual center
2010-11-17T03:35:09  <burny> think my bot will almost always go to 200turns if it wins.. it has no clue how to attack
2010-11-17T03:35:32  <mega1> but even if they are distributed evenly on the line section they will still tend to build clusters
2010-11-17T03:35:34  <McLeopold_> it should randomly choose a side
2010-11-17T03:35:40  <mega1> it does
2010-11-17T03:36:02  <janzert> McLeopold_: the center neutrals are mirrored either side of center aren't they?

2010-11-17T03:36:17  <burny> it randomly choose a side.. and then generates all middle plants on that side
2010-11-17T03:36:22  <janzert> look at thetaA and thetaB
2010-11-17T03:36:38  <burny> theta a/b are the NON middle ones
2010-11-17T03:36:47  <janzert> oops, wrong symmetry

2010-11-17T03:37:28  <McLeopold_> it seems to me that you should choose an angle and radius, then, if the two planets are too close, merge them into one
2010-11-17T03:37:29  <burny> also: do to rounding errors.. it's possible for symetry to result in one side having a distance of 2.00000 and the other 1.9999999
2010-11-17T03:37:37  <burny> that might be important to fix
2010-11-17T03:37:57  <McLeopold_> the epsilon is suppose to fix that
2010-11-17T03:37:59  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.91.14> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2010-11-17T03:38:10  <janzert> yeah, epsilon is to prevent that
2010-11-17T03:38:28  <burny> so if 2 planets have a distance that is real close to an integer, it throws one away?
2010-11-17T03:38:29  <janzert> it's used in the function not_valid
2010-11-17T03:38:36  <janzert> yes
2010-11-17T03:38:39  <burny> ok
2010-11-17T03:39:28  <burny> woot, 0for 4!
2010-11-17T03:39:34  <janzert> ugh, so yeah the unbalanced center planets is definitely purposeful
2010-11-17T03:39:43  <janzert> wish I knew why
2010-11-17T03:40:39  <janzert> but I guess I don't see a pressing need to change it now
2010-11-17T03:40:39  <mega1> it's the spice I tell you
2010-11-17T03:40:46  <mega1> no, it's ok
2010-11-17T03:43:03  <burny> sleepy times for me
2010-11-17T03:43:05  <burny> laters
2010-11-17T03:43:12  <McLeopold_> well, picking 0-5 centers just because throws of the uniform densidty

2010-11-17T03:43:50  <McLeopold_> it would be better to merge if it was too close to the line
2010-11-17T03:44:46  <janzert> yeah, that may be but too large of a change for too little benefit for me to consider now
2010-11-17T03:45:02  <McLeopold_> except for last week?
2010-11-17T03:45:07  <mega1> heh
2010-11-17T03:45:21  <McLeopold_> janzert: no, I think that is a big deal
2010-11-17T03:45:21  <mega1> let's try to finalize it
2010-11-17T03:45:39  <McLeopold_> the line symetry maps put too much on the center line
2010-11-17T03:45:57  <janzert> remember I wasn't in favor of changing last week either
2010-11-17T03:46:10  <janzert> my vote was to use the original generator
2010-11-17T03:46:23  <grog> do you guys really think is right for people with bots in the game to be desiging the maps???
2010-11-17T03:46:34  <mega1> no
2010-11-17T03:46:48  <mega1> I'm tainted and withdraw.
2010-11-17T03:46:50  <janzert> grog: the overall properties sure
2010-11-17T03:46:52  <McLeopold_> if it is an open process, then yes
2010-11-17T03:47:08  <mega1> grog: seriously, you are right
2010-11-17T03:47:25  <janzert> the organizers don't have experience on the maps
2010-11-17T03:47:47  <McLeopold_> we are not hand designing maps
2010-11-17T03:47:59  <McLeopold_> we are trying to produce a system that does not have bias
2010-11-17T03:47:59  <mega1> I don't I ever had 900 elo on tcp
2010-11-17T03:48:03  <mega1> +think
2010-11-17T03:48:08  <mega1> it's getting close
2010-11-17T03:49:34  <mega1> who is "a" and "aibot_current_dev"?
2010-11-17T03:49:46  <McLeopold_> a is flagcapper
2010-11-17T03:50:25  <McLeopold_> janzert: if 0-5 is a number that maintains uniform density, then great, otherwise, it is a bais
2010-11-17T03:50:29  <mega1> changed his name generator
2010-11-17T03:51:27  <grog> this is not an open process, there are 4000 players and about 4 here
2010-11-17T03:51:29  <janzert> McLeopold_: what is the big problem with non-uniform density? also I doubt it's lost in the noise density variation anyway
2010-11-17T03:52:26  <McLeopold_> well, yeah, it's nit picky, but I think overall, you'll have more planets on the line with all the line symmetrical maps
2010-11-17T03:53:01  <mega1> grog: we are just cleaning up. Neither of us wanted to change the generator.
2010-11-17T03:53:04  <McLeopold_> so, I think the probabilty of a planet on the line is higher than anywhere else
2010-11-17T03:53:17  <janzert> isn't that the point?
2010-11-17T03:53:21  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.83.154> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-17T03:53:28  <McLeopold_> Well, I suppose it might be.
2010-11-17T03:53:32  <janzert> other wise you could just rip that code out
2010-11-17T03:53:50  <McLeopold_> you'd still want to merge if you generated near the line
2010-11-17T03:53:59  <Accoun> http://zeroviz.us:8080/ down?
2010-11-17T03:54:00  <McLeopold_> otherwise you'd have to little on the line

2010-11-17T03:55:17  <Accoun> IP the same?

2010-11-17T03:55:21  <McLeopold_> Except from people from china...
2010-11-17T03:55:23  <janzert> for me that is
2010-11-17T03:55:29  <Accoun> 98.247.248.39 995 ?
2010-11-17T03:56:02  <McLeopold_> Accoun: that's correct
2010-11-17T03:56:34  <Accoun> down for me now

2010-11-17T03:57:50  <McLeopold_> janzert: i suppose the other thing is that the clusters never seem to be in the center
2010-11-17T03:57:59  <McLeopold_> just the edges

2010-11-17T03:58:23  <Accoun> and http down
2010-11-17T03:59:14  <McLeopold_> mega1: I mean the edges of the line
2010-11-17T03:59:22  <McLeopold_> so around 2 points
2010-11-17T03:59:48  <mega1> hmm, I haven't noticed
2010-11-17T04:00:23  <Accoun> from proxi worck well
2010-11-17T04:00:25  <McLeopold_> I think I know why
2010-11-17T04:01:07  <McLeopold_> If you pick a theta near the line, you have to have a large radius so the two planets are the minimum distance
2010-11-17T04:01:22  <McLeopold_> so for those theta, only large radius will qualify
2010-11-17T04:01:52  <McLeopold_> to compensate, extra center neutrals should be generated, but they should be closer to the center
2010-11-17T04:02:15  <McLeopold_> so, the end points of the line will have higher density
2010-11-17T04:02:21  <janzert> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1094&p=7397#p7397
2010-11-17T04:02:23  <McLeopold_> which is where the clusters usually are

2010-11-17T04:05:37  <McLeopold_> so, are you too tired to think?
2010-11-17T04:05:56  <Accoun> McLeopold_> is up
2010-11-17T04:06:06  <Accoun> strange
2010-11-17T04:06:11  <McLeopold_> just read above and give me a quick impression, that's all I ask
2010-11-17T04:06:36  <janzert> to me that is at least a medium sized change and I really don't want to change it unless it is really going to cause major problems, well at least semi-major ones ;)

2010-11-17T04:07:31  <McLeopold_> okay, it's medium size, but it make sense?
2010-11-17T04:07:38  <amstan> McLeopold_: it's clearly that though.. lol, it's magically up after i gave him the link
2010-11-17T04:07:57  <McLeopold_> I think it was magically up after I unbanned him/
2010-11-17T04:08:08  <McLeopold_> jk
2010-11-17T04:08:12  <amstan> McLeopold_: you banned him? lol
2010-11-17T04:08:15  <McLeopold_> no
2010-11-17T04:08:30  <janzert> McLeopold_: I'm not sure one way or the other
2010-11-17T04:08:34  <McLeopold_> He's a good bot.  I need to know how to beat him.
2010-11-17T04:08:46  <McLeopold_> janzert: okay, thanks for looking.
2010-11-17T04:09:39  <janzert> to expand a little bit, I think *some* clustering is actually good but I can see where too much could cause problems
2010-11-17T04:09:50  <McLeopold_> oh, clustering is fine
2010-11-17T04:09:57  <McLeopold_> I just don't want it to be predictable
2010-11-17T04:10:02  <amstan> janzert: oh.. what do you think about my framework redesign post?
2010-11-17T04:10:07  <janzert> but like I said before, I think the players have a much better feel for this than I do
2010-11-17T04:10:28  <janzert> amstan: mostly that I don't want to think about it yet :/
2010-11-17T04:10:33  <amstan> lol
2010-11-17T04:10:34  <McLeopold_> :)
2010-11-17T04:10:42  <janzert> but overall it looked good
2010-11-17T04:10:46  <McLeopold_> okay, but I've got the fix if you want it
2010-11-17T04:11:13  <McLeopold_> if I get antimatroid to agree?
2010-11-17T04:11:25  <janzert> post about it in the forums and I'll see what the responses are by tomorrow

2010-11-17T09:22:27  <antimatroid> oh, i first read that as you were depressed that bix0r's bot is getting beaten by the ones he wrote months ago, hence my confusion :P
2010-11-17T09:22:29  <eburnette> Most programs, let's say for example a sorting algorithm, if I write a new version I can tell if it's better or not. This is not like that.

2010-11-17T09:24:22  <eburnette> I haven't figured a way to do iterative improvements. Maybe if I had a supercomputer and could run 1000 games a second after every change...

2010-11-17T12:05:15  <McLeopold> yeah, so, sometimes you're not calculating off the true home planets
2010-11-17T12:05:22  <McLeopold> see my line up code above
2010-11-17T12:05:26  <antimatroid> i may be riding across the state in january with a couple of friends, if we can get a date we're all free
2010-11-17T12:05:43  <antimatroid> yeah, okay
2010-11-17T12:05:44  <antimatroid> hmmm
2010-11-17T12:06:12  <McLeopold> I'm putting a change on pastebin in a minute
2010-11-17T12:06:17  <antimatroid> save distp1p2 in a variable or something?
2010-11-17T12:06:48  <antimatroid> what are your thoughts on making the "special" neutrals non-snipable?
2010-11-17T12:06:53  <antimatroid> i think that's a good idea
2010-11-17T12:07:01  <antimatroid> but it does let stupid bots off easy at the end
2010-11-17T12:07:04  <McLeopold> yes, I'm writing the code, one minute
2010-11-17T12:07:05  <antimatroid> particularly for the lower ranked bots

2010-11-17T12:07:17  <McLeopold> no, they will still not win. :)
2010-11-17T12:07:40  <antimatroid> yes, but you might have two shit bots that are otherwise equal, but one doesn't handle those cases well
2010-11-17T12:07:48  <antimatroid> excluding those maps will make them appear identical
2010-11-17T12:08:27  <antimatroid> i generally care about the top 20 or so, but i can understand why people that have spent time but aren't up there would possibly want that
2010-11-17T12:08:30  <antimatroid> if that makes sense at all?
2010-11-17T12:08:53  <McLeopold> what we don't want is a top bot to draw against a horrible bot
2010-11-17T12:09:21  <antimatroid> bocsimackos current upload lost to a 600+ ranked bot the other day
2010-11-17T12:09:27  <McLeopold> because we can't guarantee a full round robin, that would be devistating if you drew the wrong map early on
2010-11-17T12:09:40  <McLeopold> well, a loss is different
2010-11-17T12:09:50  <antimatroid> wouldn't that be worse?
2010-11-17T12:10:02  <McLeopold> for the ratings, yes, but you deserve a loss
2010-11-17T12:10:13  <McLeopold> a map where there are no options is different
2010-11-17T12:10:32  <antimatroid> i do agree ranking the top bots is most important
2010-11-17T12:10:36  <antimatroid> add the change :)
2010-11-17T12:10:45  <McLeopold> okay, hold on...
2010-11-17T12:10:47  <antimatroid> i'm just trying to think of people other than myself
2010-11-17T12:10:54  <antimatroid> i don't do it often :P

2010-11-17T12:24:42  <antimatroid> looks good to me
2010-11-17T12:24:51  <antimatroid> it was a bad bug too
2010-11-17T12:24:54  <mega1> McLeopold: what is the bug?
2010-11-17T12:25:30  <McLeopold> the RageBot check
2010-11-17T12:25:48  <McLeopold> It wasn't always calculating from the home planets, because the variables sometimes got overwritten
2010-11-17T12:26:13  <McLeopold> plus, you should read the logs from 10 minutes ago
2010-11-17T12:26:31  <McLeopold> and my two posts
2010-11-17T12:26:58  <McLeopold> I don't think I'll convince everyone, but I won't feel better if it was you that rejected me. :)
2010-11-17T12:27:12  <McLeopold> I mean, I would feel better.
2010-11-17T12:27:39  <antimatroid> yep, well for any of those things i'm indifferent
2010-11-17T12:27:48  <antimatroid> although your solutions do seem better
2010-11-17T12:29:38  <McLeopold> just not my bot :(

2010-11-17T12:39:39  <antimatroid> who is phil hassey?
2010-11-17T12:40:35  <McLeopold> mega1: #1, make the special neutrals unsnipable.
2010-11-17T12:40:58  <McLeopold> mega1: #2, fix the bias toward putting planets and the end points of the line in line symmetric maps
2010-11-17T12:41:34  <McLeopold> mega1: the math on both should be checked
2010-11-17T12:41:48  <mega1> #1, I don't know whether the single planet is effective at reducing the number of draws, so no idea
2010-11-17T12:42:00  <McLeopold> since I suck at circle distribution. :)
2010-11-17T12:42:25  <McLeopold> mega1: but at least the obvious move isn't to sit there
2010-11-17T12:42:39  <McLeopold> I think that is enough to make a difference between a good bot and a bad one
2010-11-17T12:42:40  <jmcarthur> d0ugal: it's the one called galcon
2010-11-17T12:42:58  <mega1> McLeopold: if it's obvious then even a bad bot will find it
2010-11-17T12:43:00  <jmcarthur> d0ugal: it's just the official galcon ai, essentially. not really a competitor
2010-11-17T12:43:13  <McLeopold> mega1: true
2010-11-17T12:44:09  <mega1> I can't tell without actually looking at games and measuring draw rates.
2010-11-17T12:44:20  <mega1> #2 sounds good
2010-11-17T12:44:37  <mega1> although I forgot what the bug was
2010-11-17T12:44:47  <mega1> or what caused it
2010-11-17T12:44:56  <mega1> the minimum distance check, right?
2010-11-17T12:45:03  <McLeopold> check draw rates here:  http://zeroviz.us:8080/by_Map.html
2010-11-17T12:45:11  <McLeopold> uh yeah
2010-11-17T12:45:14  <McLeopold> no
2010-11-17T12:45:25  <McLeopold> the minimim distance check was already implemented
2010-11-17T12:45:43  <McLeopold> but minimum distance plays a role in this other bias
2010-11-17T12:46:57  <antimatroid> it might also be a bad first move
2010-11-17T12:47:10  <antimatroid> i think it's worth having it be non-snipable
2010-11-17T12:47:16  <antimatroid> but i'm clambering in to bed now
2010-11-17T12:47:17  <antimatroid> night
2010-11-17T12:47:55  <McLeopold> cya
2010-11-17T12:48:43  <McLeopold> hmm, the radius wasn't fixed right...
2010-11-17T12:48:43  <mega1> McLeopold: the greater the minimum distance the greater the emptiness in the middle
2010-11-17T12:48:50  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-17T12:49:05  <McLeopold> but more so on line symmetry
2010-11-17T12:49:28  <mega1> why? this is that I can't recall
2010-11-17T12:49:28  <McLeopold> and the greater density at the end points of the line
2010-11-17T12:49:58  <McLeopold> we didn't discuss it last night, which is why you can't recall?
2010-11-17T12:50:28  <McLeopold> for a theta close to the center line, small radius will be thrown out, large ones will be kept
2010-11-17T12:51:01  <McLeopold> That's why I think merging the two planets into 1 for small radii is best
2010-11-17T12:51:25  <McLeopold> so the radius still has an even chance of being selected near the center line
2010-11-17T12:52:05  <McLeopold> This doesn't change the fairness of the maps.  It's a pretty small nitpick.
2010-11-17T12:53:01  <bhasker> mcleopold those fancy tables on your servers slow the page load down a lot:-\
2010-11-17T12:53:06  <mega1> McLeopold: the code in question is 181-203, right?
2010-11-17T12:53:27  <McLeopold> um..
2010-11-17T12:54:23  <McLeopold> yeah, the not valid check produces the bias
2010-11-17T12:54:38  <McLeopold> line 197
2010-11-17T12:55:07  <mega1> and if it fails it takes another random theta and r
2010-11-17T12:55:32  <McLeopold> I think it should merge, not fail
2010-11-17T12:55:46  <mega1> what would merging do?
2010-11-17T12:56:13  <McLeopold> it would mean a planet still has an even chance of being generated anywhere on the center line
2010-11-17T12:56:15  <McLeopold> not just the ends
2010-11-17T12:58:46  <mega1> wait, the center line is not any more problematic than the others?
2010-11-17T12:59:09  <McLeopold> what others?  other lines?
2010-11-17T12:59:13  <mega1> yes
2010-11-17T12:59:22  <McLeopold> which lines?
2010-11-17T12:59:43  <mega1> the ones that go through the center
2010-11-17T12:59:57  <McLeopold> for radial?
2010-11-17T12:59:59  <mega1> the center of the circle
2010-11-17T13:00:16  <mega1> for either?
2010-11-17T13:00:26  <McLeopold> for radial, it's okay
2010-11-17T13:00:43  <McLeopold> for line, it's more of a problem the closer you get to the center line
2010-11-17T13:00:55  <McLeopold> because of the minimum distance
2010-11-17T13:01:16  <McLeopold> radial, the twin planet is always on the other side of the map, so doesn't get rejected
2010-11-17T13:01:57  <mega1> the same thing happens with radial: the closer you are to the central point density goes down
2010-11-17T13:02:43  *** Migi32 <Migi32!~migi@d54C1291C.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-17T13:02:45  <McLeopold> but the rejection area is only a circle of the minimum distance in the center
2010-11-17T13:03:06  <mega1> it a small circle around each already generated planet
2010-11-17T13:03:07  <McLeopold> for line, it's a box the whole length of the map
2010-11-17T13:03:19  <mega1> a box?!
2010-11-17T13:03:30  <mega1> what makes you think that?
2010-11-17T13:03:37  <McLeopold> yes, or half the minimum distance to the center line
2010-11-17T13:03:56  <mega1> sorry, I can't see that in the code
2010-11-17T13:04:12  <mega1> please point me to the right place
2010-11-17T13:04:24  <McLeopold> okay...
2010-11-17T13:04:40  <McLeopold> well, line 197
2010-11-17T13:04:50  <McLeopold> not_valid checks the minimum distance
2010-11-17T13:05:12  <McLeopold> it checks against all planets, but...
2010-11-17T13:05:37  <McLeopold> it is also going to check against the 2 twin planets just created
2010-11-17T13:05:52  <McLeopold> in line, they will always be on other sides of the line...
2010-11-17T13:06:18  <McLeopold> so if they are within half the minimum distance, they will be rejected
2010-11-17T13:06:25  <mega1> yes, so far
2010-11-17T13:06:33  <mega1> no
2010-11-17T13:07:32  <mega1> so they are rejected, but I still can't see the bias
2010-11-17T13:08:02  <McLeopold> Okay, I'm thinking now there isn't a bias toward the ends...
2010-11-17T13:08:32  <McLeopold> the 0-5 center line neutrals is suppose to compensate for the void in the center
2010-11-17T13:08:47  <McLeopold> just like the center planet compensates for the void on a radial map
2010-11-17T13:09:17  <mega1> yeah, that's a good point
2010-11-17T13:09:23  <McLeopold> 0-5 seems arbitrary, that's why I prefer a merge if a point was picked near the center line
2010-11-17T13:10:10  <mega1> you still haven't said how you merge and what
2010-11-17T13:10:15  <mega1> two planets?
2010-11-17T13:10:19  <mega1> add their growths?
2010-11-17T13:10:36  <McLeopold> no, just pick one planet and move it onto the line
2010-11-17T13:10:41  <McLeopold> same growth and ships
2010-11-17T13:10:50  <McLeopold> remove the second planet
2010-11-17T13:10:57  <McLeopold> center line neutral created!
2010-11-17T13:11:25  <mega1> why is it desirable?
2010-11-17T13:11:43  <McLeopold> so the center area has the same probability of being picked as the rest
2010-11-17T13:11:57  <McLeopold> in radial, it 100% :)
2010-11-17T13:12:31  <McLeopold> if, on average, there is really 0-5 center planets created with my method, then the code is fine
2010-11-17T13:14:12  <mega1> the "center area" is the min distance wide box around the center line?
2010-11-17T13:14:50  <McLeopold> yes

2010-11-17T13:16:15  <mega1> What you propose does fix the proportion of planets in that box.
2010-11-17T13:16:47  <mega1> It does not fix it in the half boxes on either side of the line.
2010-11-17T13:17:28  <McLeopold> it kinda pulls planets toward the center, due to the minimum distance

2010-11-17T13:35:25  <mega1> sorry for the dealy
2010-11-17T13:35:41  <mega1> my point is that there are still region where the distribution is uneven
2010-11-17T13:36:32  <mega1> the practical aspect is how many planets are equal distant from the players
2010-11-17T13:36:46  <mega1> how many are 1 step closer to one of them
2010-11-17T13:37:28  <mega1> there is more sniping opportunity as we approach the center line
2010-11-17T13:37:28  <McLeopold> 1 step won't happend in line symmetry?
2010-11-17T13:38:08  <mega1> I think it can happen.
2010-11-17T13:38:38  <McLeopold> not if a planet can't be within 1 of the center line
2010-11-17T13:38:56  <mega1> because the line connecting the player to the planet comes from an angle unrelated to angle of the line connecting the pair of planets
2010-11-17T13:39:44  <mega1> so I must say again, this time for #2, that I have no idea how it would work out
2010-11-17T13:40:28  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-17T13:44:28  <McLeopold> yep, 1 step does happen

2010-11-17T13:50:55  <bhasker> i think all the sorting it tries to do
2010-11-17T13:50:57  <bhasker> slows it down
2010-11-17T13:50:59  <bhasker> at load
2010-11-17T13:51:09  <McLeopold> oh, I don't limit the result set
2010-11-17T13:51:18  <bhasker> i think you send it sorted by time upfront
2010-11-17T13:51:21  <McLeopold> sorting is client side
2010-11-17T13:51:24  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-17T13:51:30  <bhasker> but i think it does a sort anyway
2010-11-17T13:51:31  <bhasker> at load
2010-11-17T13:51:39  <McLeopold> yes, double sort the same way.
2010-11-17T13:51:44  <McLeopold> @rainbow
2010-11-17T13:51:44  <contestbot> McLeopold: (rainbow <text>) -- Returns <text> colorized like a rainbow.
2010-11-17T13:51:46  <bhasker> yea that slows the load a lot
2010-11-17T13:52:08  <McLeopold> no, it doesn't execute until the jquery document load fires
2010-11-17T13:52:32  <McLeopold> so, you may not see it as fast, but the browser loaded it just the same
2010-11-17T13:52:46  <McLeopold> I can turn off the initial sort, it's not a big deal
2010-11-17T13:53:56  <bhasker> yea probably the initial sort turned off is better
2010-11-17T13:55:20  <McLeopold> bhasker: looks like I build the table upside down. :)
2010-11-17T13:55:46  <bhasker> hmm something i weird with its building, isee some old games first at page load
2010-11-17T13:55:50  <bhasker> i guess the upside down explains it
2010-11-17T13:55:56  <bhasker> then it resorts
2010-11-17T13:56:17  <bhasker> err now its in reverse
2010-11-17T13:56:24  <bhasker> you need to order by time desc maybe?
2010-11-17T13:56:27  <bhasker> in your sql
2010-11-17T13:56:36  <bhasker> now all the latest games are at the bottom
2010-11-17T13:59:16  <Mistmanov> question: this visualizer has the option of creating a mapfile out of any turn in a game. really handy for testing http://spz.nofate.com/planetwars/visualizer/?game_id=7707441&server=Official
2010-11-17T13:59:31  <Mistmanov> any chance of incorporating that into the tcp server?
2010-11-17T13:59:35  <McLeopold> bhasker: fixed
2010-11-17T13:59:59  <McLeopold> Mistmanov: let me check
2010-11-17T14:01:21  <bhasker> thanks
2010-11-17T14:07:46  <bhasker> much better now mcleopold doesn't take forever to load
2010-11-17T14:07:58  <McLeopold> cool
2010-11-17T14:08:08  <McLeopold> I'm halfway to the game state extractor

2010-11-17T14:09:00  <Mistmanov> cool =)
2010-11-17T14:10:12  <bhasker> i wonder if it would be possible to build an visualizer which can overlay custom data
2010-11-17T14:10:13  <bhasker> per turn
2010-11-17T14:10:16  <bhasker> on the graph
2010-11-17T14:10:19  <bhasker> or on the canvas
2010-11-17T14:10:36  <bhasker> i should brush up my javascript skillz
2010-11-17T14:11:03  <Mistmanov> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=751&start=40
2010-11-17T14:11:07  <Mistmanov> was working on something like that
2010-11-17T14:11:39  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-17T14:12:32  <Mistmanov> but having a visualizer that automatically displays all the logging for a turn would also be nice
2010-11-17T14:12:40  <Mistmanov> but should be done locally ofcourse
2010-11-17T14:15:07  <McLeopold> Mistmanov: game state is now there
2010-11-17T14:15:16  <Mistmanov> thanks, gonna try it out =)
2010-11-17T14:16:10  <bhasker> in the visualizer what does the first number indicate
2010-11-17T14:16:13  <bhasker> i see like 2+5
2010-11-17T14:16:16  <bhasker> 16+5
2010-11-17T14:16:17  <bhasker> etc
2010-11-17T14:16:21  <McLeopold> planet id, growth rate
2010-11-17T14:16:26  <bhasker> ah doh
2010-11-17T14:16:31  <McLeopold> it could look better
2010-11-17T14:17:07  <Mistmanov> mcleopold: works like a charm =) many thanks

2010-11-17T14:27:46  <Error323> I think the growthrate isn't necessary

2010-11-17T14:28:06  <Error323> as the radius already visualizes that and it bloats it a bit

2010-11-17T15:15:12  <janzert> McLeopold: Without code to add center line planets and instead merging planets too close, maps would average just under 1 planet on the line
2010-11-17T15:15:21  <Error323> bhasker: this is my heuristic function, not alphabeta or anything
2010-11-17T15:15:27  <Error323> I gave up on that given the time left
2010-11-17T15:15:45  <bhasker> yea mine is heuristic too, i am not doing any minmaxing
2010-11-17T15:15:52  <bhasker> i am just scoring my moves
2010-11-17T15:15:56  <bhasker> and executing the best ones
2010-11-17T15:15:59  <McLeopold> janzert: mega1 and I hashed it out earlier, there is a slight bais, but it's not worth the change
2010-11-17T15:16:06  <janzert> yeah, ok
2010-11-17T15:16:07  <bhasker> i take my available ships and run through the plaents and see what moves i can do
2010-11-17T15:16:16  <bhasker> and score each one based on the end state after the move is executed
2010-11-17T15:16:18  <McLeopold> janzert: and my fix just introduces a different bias
2010-11-17T15:16:31  <McLeopold> but check out the unsnipable fix
2010-11-17T15:16:50  <McLeopold> even if we don't use the, there is still the incorrect home planet bug

2010-11-17T15:18:10  <janzert> incorrect home planet? you mean the off by one in calculating safety from ragebot?
2010-11-17T15:18:57  <McLeopold> no, I mean bad code with overloaded variables
2010-11-17T15:19:20  <McLeopold> the variables p1 and p2 are not always the home planets
2010-11-17T15:19:28  <McLeopold> it needs to be planet[1] planet[2]
2010-11-17T15:19:40  <janzert> where?

2010-11-17T15:21:06  <janzert> ahh, I see in the ragebot safe planet calc
2010-11-17T15:21:34  <McLeopold> antimatroid was for the antisnipe code
2010-11-17T15:21:55  <McLeopold> I think mega1 was too...
2010-11-17T15:22:15  <janzert> hmm, no that doesn't have anything to do with sniping that I can see
2010-11-17T15:22:18  <McLeopold> No, mega1 was indifferent
2010-11-17T15:22:24  <janzert> oh, nm
2010-11-17T15:22:27  <janzert> misunderstood
2010-11-17T15:22:40  <janzert> I don't think I'll add antisniping
2010-11-17T15:22:56  <janzert> I'd rather not add additional constraints
2010-11-17T15:23:01  <janzert> to the generator
2010-11-17T15:23:17  <McLeopold> I already wrote it, and it stays within spec
2010-11-17T15:23:21  <janzert> instead watch actual map statistics and remove ones that do bad
2010-11-17T15:23:28  <McLeopold> That would work too
2010-11-17T15:23:46  <McLeopold> But what about when you do the final?  Will bad maps be removed then too?
2010-11-17T15:23:56  <janzert> yes, that is what I'm hoping
2010-11-17T15:24:07  <McLeopold> Oh, then who cares?
2010-11-17T15:24:13  <janzert> right :)
2010-11-17T15:24:42  <McLeopold> Okay.  If you make the change to the p1 and p2 variables.  We can call it good and I can regenerate.
2010-11-17T15:24:44  <janzert> but of course I don't have anything written to actually monitor draw percentages and such yet so...
2010-11-17T15:25:05  <McLeopold> Ha!  I do.
2010-11-17T15:25:52  <janzert> yeah but not integrated with the contest server :)
2010-11-17T15:25:54  <McLeopold> You'll need some type of criteria.
2010-11-17T15:26:10  <McLeopold> X percent draws with only the top 100 or something
2010-11-17T15:26:24  <janzert> and is there anything other than draw percentage that should be watched
2010-11-17T15:26:35  <janzert> yeah, that's my basic idea at the moment

2010-11-17T15:27:01  <McLeopold> You're really just trying to remove maps that skew results.
2010-11-17T15:27:14  <McLeopold> Because not everyone will play every map
2010-11-17T15:27:19  <McLeopold> against everyone
2010-11-17T15:27:42  <McLeopold> There is the part about getting a fair sampling
2010-11-17T15:28:00  <McLeopold> But unless we can agree on map metrics, that's a hugh argument to be had.
2010-11-17T15:28:25  <janzert> yes, and that is somewhat separate from the 'online' monitoring anyway
2010-11-17T15:28:50  <McLeopold> Okay, waiting for r538...

2010-11-17T15:32:52  <McLeopold> ?
2010-11-17T15:33:01  <janzert> just translate by maxRadius instead of maxRadius + 2 would be the simplest
2010-11-17T15:33:08  <McLeopold> is there a problem with that?
2010-11-17T15:33:12  <janzert> function translate_planets
2010-11-17T15:33:30  <janzert> no real problem I suppose more cosmetic
2010-11-17T15:33:37  <McLeopold> is that to center it so everything is a positive coord?
2010-11-17T15:33:49  <janzert> the smallest x or y we can get is 2 right now instead of 0
2010-11-17T15:33:50  <janzert> yes
2010-11-17T15:34:08  <McLeopold> well, that's a quick fix

2010-11-17T15:35:32  <janzert> hmm, whether to do it anyway or just leave it now

2010-11-17T15:50:06  <janzert> Error323: these changes are just to fix 'bugs' introduced by the replacement map generator, so you can consider the feature freeze as being last Saturday
2010-11-17T15:50:22  <medrimonia> If the changes were that the size was four times bigger, it would have been very annoying, but here, there's nothing that changes too much from before
2010-11-17T15:50:43  <lavalamp__> how do you guys figure out how many ships to hold back to defend against hypothetical threats (e.g. ragebot)?
2010-11-17T15:50:46  <iamluck> Create a vote for extending the contest till January? :)
2010-11-17T15:51:09  <Error323> janzert: I understand, but still I have to regenerate with the mapgen and see how the bot is doing now :]
2010-11-17T15:51:10  <lavalamp__> That's just killing my bot right now :(
2010-11-17T15:51:35  <janzert> iamluck: I really don't think any extension is going to happen
2010-11-17T15:51:37  <Error323> janzert: so is the latest in svn yet?
2010-11-17T15:51:40  <medrimonia> No don't extend the contest until January, I've got to work and sleep!!!!
2010-11-17T15:51:44  <janzert> Error323: yes
2010-11-17T15:52:06  <iamluck> lavalamp_: 100 - distance * growth? :)
2010-11-17T15:52:10  <janzert> also see above McLeopold posted a zip with a fresh run
2010-11-17T15:52:41  * lavalamp__ rolls eyes
2010-11-17T15:52:54  <medrimonia> lavalamp_: I'm just verifying for the planet how much ships the enemy can send to my planets, and how much I can send
2010-11-17T15:53:02  <janzert> McLeopold: be great if you could post about it in the forums as well

2010-11-17T15:53:50  <McLeopold> map generator finalized
2010-11-17T15:54:42  <medrimonia> The hard part is to find a way to keep free_ships, without taking too much risks
2010-11-17T15:55:03  <lavalamp__> what's free_ships to you?
2010-11-17T15:55:28  <medrimonia> Ships that you can send without taking the risk of loosing a planet

2010-11-17T15:56:48  <lavalamp__> hmm... how do you calculate that? every one of their planets vs every one of yours?
2010-11-17T15:57:29  <medrimonia> I've a matrix with the state of every planet during the next SIZEMAP turns
2010-11-17T15:57:52  <lavalamp__> same here
2010-11-17T15:58:31  <medrimonia> And I look at the number of ship of all the planets I will own at distance(source_id,dest_id)
2010-11-17T15:58:33  <lavalamp__> I can defend against ships in flight no problem... the problem is defending against ships that haven't been launched yet
2010-11-17T15:58:48  <medrimonia> And the same for the enemy
2010-11-17T15:59:23  <lavalamp__> hmmm that's exactly what I was trying to do, maybe I have a bug :/
2010-11-17T15:59:51  <mega1> regarding maps: aren't the ones with fewer planets more likely to be drawish?
2010-11-17T16:00:18  <McLeopold> I don't think so.
2010-11-17T16:00:30  <McLeopold> There is less opportunity for error, I suppose.
2010-11-17T16:00:42  <lavalamp__> a two planet map is very likely to be a draw
2010-11-17T16:01:02  <McLeopold> true, but min is 15
2010-11-17T16:01:25  <McLeopold> Janzert mentioned they would monitor maps with lots of draws and remove them.
2010-11-17T16:01:33  <lavalamp__> 3-planet map ought to always be a draw, too. After that I think it depends on the map.
2010-11-17T16:01:50  <mega1> I've read that. It can be a subjective process.

2010-11-17T16:05:52  <amstan> so.. i deleted the old groups

2010-11-17T16:12:21  <lavalamp__> amstan: what you're doing is a good idea, but you may want to do it by placing peolpe in a group other than mods, if possible. Some (not me) could percieve that as some sort of favoritism, esp. if a lot of peolpe with high-ranking bots end up there.
2010-11-17T16:12:46  <Zannick> someone made me not a moderator?
2010-11-17T16:13:07  <amstan> Zannick: hmm?
2010-11-17T16:13:18  <Zannick> eh
2010-11-17T16:13:27  <pgpaskar> amstan: why are you restricting this to moderators
2010-11-17T16:13:29  <Zannick> i want to have a different name on the forums anyway
2010-11-17T16:13:33  <amstan> lavalamp__: the thing is that we need to assume the same ammount of trust for both people
2010-11-17T16:13:43  <pgpaskar> create a new permission group for that forum and put people in thar rather than giving them administrator powers over the forums
2010-11-17T16:13:53  <pgpaskar> You can set existing mods/admins to inherit those permissions
2010-11-17T16:14:17  <lavalamp__> That's fine, but there's no need for them to be mods, is there?
2010-11-17T16:14:23  <amstan> pgpaskar: i know.. but if they're allowed to post in there it means we care enough about them to consider their suggestions
2010-11-17T16:14:42  <amstan> pgpaskar: there's also a need for mods, i think those 2 groups intersect
2010-11-17T16:14:45  <pgpaskar> what does that have to do with moderators
2010-11-17T16:15:02  <amstan> mods are also people that you trust
2010-11-17T16:15:18  <pgpaskar> no, mods are people who clean up and take care of spam/bad users in the forums

2010-11-17T17:30:19  <lavalamp__> what kind of error are we talking about here? battle outcome or something else?
2010-11-17T17:30:29  <burny> if you resubmit your bot: do the old games still remain in history?(just not effect rank?)
2010-11-17T17:30:56  <Zannick> curious.
2010-11-17T17:31:00  <lavalamp__> they will show up in the history of the people you played but not yours, I think
2010-11-17T17:31:12  <Zannick> are you talking about opposing fleets arriving at the same time at a planet?

2010-11-17T17:31:40  <lavalamp__> that logic is tricky to get correct
2010-11-17T17:31:45  <lavalamp__> yes they do.
2010-11-17T17:31:45  <Zannick> yeah, the result is highest player's total minus second highest player's total
2010-11-17T17:32:17  <Zannick> it seems weird, but that's the way that case was settled on a month and a half ago
2010-11-17T17:32:20  <burny> ok, cool. going to resubmit my proper bot now.. just didn't want to lose the history links
2010-11-17T17:32:25  <lavalamp__> there is no way the organizers could change the engine now, even if there were a bug

2010-11-17T17:36:50  <burny> attacking an 85 in teh middle on first turn is a foresure loss
2010-11-17T17:37:04  <lavalamp__> 30 is in the middle, 85 nearby
2010-11-17T17:37:17  <burny> attacking a 30 in mid on first move isn't a good move either
2010-11-17T17:37:36  <lavalamp__> JamesMG: no tools with me atm
2010-11-17T17:37:50  <burny> the 85 would have to be atleast 8units from the middle to be a good move
2010-11-17T17:38:06  <burny> and starting positions atleast 20units apart
2010-11-17T17:38:11  <JamesMG> mine goes for the 85
2010-11-17T17:38:21  <lavalamp__> yeah going for the 85 is correct on that map
2010-11-17T17:38:37  <lavalamp__> didn't look right to me at first
2010-11-17T17:38:39  <JamesMG> http://pastebin.com/579Ys0KG
2010-11-17T17:38:45  <JamesMG> in case anyone else wants it
2010-11-17T17:38:54  <lavalamp__> ^^
2010-11-17T17:39:12  <lavalamp__> JamesMG do you knapsack it?
2010-11-17T17:39:27  <JamesMG> no, ordered list of planets
2010-11-17T17:39:31  <lavalamp__> k
2010-11-17T17:39:44  <JamesMG> I can run it through my knapsack minimax bot...
2010-11-17T17:39:54  <lavalamp__> eh, it's ok
2010-11-17T17:40:07  <lavalamp__> it's pretty clearly better, I think
2010-11-17T17:40:35  <JamesMG> knapsack bot goes 85 and 10
2010-11-17T17:40:44  <burny> the 9cost and 10cost 3growth are very likely to be better choices, depending on the placement of stuff
2010-11-17T17:41:08  <burny> I don't see any 30population planets though
2010-11-17T17:41:17  <JamesMG> middle planet is
2010-11-17T17:41:48  <burny> oh.. that one is shorter lol
2010-11-17T17:41:52  <JamesMG> yeah
2010-11-17T17:41:57  <JamesMG> planetID 0
2010-11-17T17:42:14  <burny> best bet on that map, is to wait 1frame, and then take the 30
2010-11-17T17:42:31  <lavalamp__> haha
2010-11-17T17:42:34  <burny> unless opponent takign hte 9 or the 10, prevents you from safely taking hte 85
2010-11-17T17:42:39  <McLeopold> http://zeroviz.us:8080/map_r528_28.txt.html
2010-11-17T17:43:53  <lavalamp__> nice, dmj made exactly my move ^^
2010-11-17T17:44:05  <JamesMG> ouch, shows my bot's incompentance after turn 1 for sure
2010-11-17T17:44:34  <burny> oh, nver mind.. the 85 isn't near the middle
2010-11-17T17:44:40  <burny> the 85 is best move for sure
2010-11-17T17:44:58  <burny> it's like 10steps from middle
2010-11-17T17:45:23  <burny> and 3ish from starting point
2010-11-17T17:45:38  <lavalamp__> lol, Error323 lets a +3 planet with 0 ships on it sit there in one of those games
2010-11-17T17:46:28  <JamesMG> is the math on that correct?  wow
2010-11-17T17:46:33  <lavalamp__> I wish there was a pairing of dmj and E323 on that map, I'd like to see their moves go head to head
2010-11-17T17:46:47  <JamesMG> I guess it is..., but weird
2010-11-17T17:47:07  <McLeopold> I go for the neutral 10 on the side
2010-11-17T17:47:41  <burny> actually ya.. the 10 and the 85 both on first turn is best
2010-11-17T17:47:50  <McLeopold> not the 85
2010-11-17T17:48:17  <lavalamp__> burny: yeah and that's what I do :)
2010-11-17T17:48:21  <burny> and the 9 on 3rd frame
2010-11-17T17:48:38  <JamesMG> wish I could request that map on TCP now
2010-11-17T17:48:39  <lavalamp__> McLeopold, do you do knapsack or priority list or something else?
2010-11-17T17:48:45  <JamesMG> made a change that should make my bot slightly less dumb on it
2010-11-17T17:48:49  <burny> actually.. second frame for the 9
2010-11-17T17:48:56  <McLeopold> A weird combination of both
2010-11-17T17:49:01  <lavalamp__> haha
2010-11-17T17:51:27  <JamesMG> kind of interesting that on zeroviz most games by far go to 200 turns
2010-11-17T17:51:42  <McLeopold> yeah, bots are better
2010-11-17T17:51:48  <McLeopold> or really dumb :)
2010-11-17T17:52:54  <burny> bah, my bot gives a compile error when I submit it..
2010-11-17T17:53:02  <burny> it will Email me the compiler output?
2010-11-17T17:54:12  <burny> takes like an hour though?
2010-11-17T17:54:34  <lavalamp__> burny: I don't get those emails :/
2010-11-17T17:54:56  <burny> how do you fix it then?
2010-11-17T17:55:01  <McLeopold> @pastewars

2010-11-17T17:55:38  <lavalamp__> if janzert show up you can ask him... check your spam folder though
2010-11-17T17:55:54  <burny> like.. guess that it can't use C++ style comments..
2010-11-17T17:56:03  <burny> or that you can't declare a non namespaced class..
2010-11-17T17:56:05  <burny> or some such?
2010-11-17T17:56:15  <McLeopold> http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt/573
2010-11-17T17:56:23  <McLeopold> ^^ my openings
2010-11-17T17:56:33  <McLeopold> 11 to the neutral only, wait to snipe
2010-11-17T17:56:52  <burny> do you take the 30 on frame2 then?
2010-11-17T17:57:03  <McLeopold> only because I'm reacting
2010-11-17T17:57:28  <McLeopold> My older bot didn't have antisniping code, so it took it with some extra
2010-11-17T17:57:53  <burny> anti sniping?
2010-11-17T17:58:03  <JamesMG> yeah, looks like antbot likes to snipe scotty
2010-11-17T17:58:10  <McLeopold> :)
2010-11-17T17:58:38  <McLeopold> burny: anti sniping is the same as "don't go for the 30 in the center, that's a bad move"
2010-11-17T17:58:38  <burny> if you go to middle on first frame, and opponent doesn't take the 85(or do something stupid).. you lose
2010-11-17T17:59:04  <burny> ahhh
2010-11-17T17:59:07  <McLeopold> yeah, that's why the 85 is bad, you give your opponent the opportunity to take the center
2010-11-17T17:59:22  <lavalamp__> yeah I need to put in some that-planet-can-be-sniped code...
2010-11-17T17:59:31  <JamesMG> same
2010-11-17T17:59:39  <JamesMG> after I fix so many other problems
2010-11-17T17:59:46  <lavalamp__> JamesMG: like this one: http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=1457
2010-11-17T17:59:47  <burny> the 85 should beat the 30 though, due to distances
2010-11-17T17:59:49  <McLeopold> I wrote that code for the map generator
2010-11-17T18:00:04  <JamesMG> oh god lavalamp__ :(
2010-11-17T18:00:22  <lavalamp__> ^^ ragebot fail
2010-11-17T18:00:27  <JamesMG> how long ago was that?
2010-11-17T18:00:35  <JamesMG> I bugged my code this morning and fixed it about an hour ago
2010-11-17T18:00:49  <lavalamp__> yesterday night?

2010-11-17T18:00:56  <McLeopold> look for the snipable function

2010-11-17T18:01:43  <JamesMG> p1 and p2 are your planet/closest enemy planet?
2010-11-17T18:01:55  <McLeopold> p1 and p2 are the home planets
2010-11-17T18:01:59  <McLeopold> p3 is the neutral
2010-11-17T18:02:17  <McLeopold> it returns true if it is a bad target
2010-11-17T18:02:27  <JamesMG> ah
2010-11-17T18:03:00  <McLeopold> assuming the enemy hits 1 turn later with the same amount of ships
2010-11-17T18:03:10  <McLeopold> so it is only useful for the first turn
2010-11-17T18:03:21  <McLeopold> You would need a more generic function throughout the game
2010-11-17T18:03:41  <McLeopold> err...not 1 turn later
2010-11-17T18:03:48  <McLeopold> but 1 turn or later
2010-11-17T18:03:56  <lavalamp__> hm... I wonder if my bot would do the same thing if the payoff table engine were on...
2010-11-17T18:03:57  <McLeopold> depending on how much closer you are
2010-11-17T18:06:26  <McLeopold> JamesMG: remember my center fail?
2010-11-17T18:06:31  <JamesMG> yeah McLeopold
2010-11-17T18:06:43  <McLeopold> That's were some of my formulas break down
2010-11-17T18:06:52  <JamesMG> ah
2010-11-17T18:06:53  <McLeopold> somehow my bot thought those planets were snipable

2010-11-17T18:08:15  <McLeopold> that map is tough
2010-11-17T18:08:15  <JamesMG> oh, yeah I see
2010-11-17T18:08:27  <McLeopold> Perhaps 100 to the good side of the map?
2010-11-17T18:08:32  <JamesMG> if you don't make the leap out to those good planets...
2010-11-17T18:08:40  <JamesMG> which looks really like a bad move at first glance
2010-11-17T18:08:50  <lavalamp__> wow that is a massive center fail :/
2010-11-17T18:08:54  <McLeopold> yeah, it's almost worth losing your home planet
2010-11-17T18:09:22  <McLeopold> Turn 1: it looks snipable, Turn 2: oops too late, go for other stuff

2010-11-17T18:13:07  <JamesMG> whoa what, my old bot makes different moves depending on which starter planet it gets
2010-11-17T18:13:10  <McLeopold> which means you have a planet id bias?
2010-11-17T18:13:34  <JamesMG> http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=4262
2010-11-17T18:13:53  <JamesMG> I suppose I must, strange
2010-11-17T18:14:05  <McLeopold> I still have it in some places
2010-11-17T18:14:07  <lavalamp__> wow I do have a lot of 200 turn games
2010-11-17T18:14:25  <McLeopold> planet 25 and 26 are the same distance
2010-11-17T18:14:28  <JamesMG> planetID bias explains why I hit 25 instead of 26
2010-11-17T18:14:32  <McLeopold> so, which is better?
2010-11-17T18:14:37  <JamesMG> but I don't hit either from the top starting position

2010-11-17T18:21:22  <lavalamp__> so you can figure out if you're "really" player 2 based on which planet you start out with?
2010-11-17T18:21:43  <burny> so roughly a thousand people have entered the default bot with zero changes?

2010-11-17T18:25:39  <burny> usually with this kind of thing, you don't get 'real' maps

2010-11-17T18:27:34  <lavalamp__> burny: no but the generator that made them is
2010-11-17T18:27:43  <McLeopold> burny: no, the generator is final.  The maps will look like the ones on my server
2010-11-17T18:28:08  <Error323> McLeopold: you are absolutely positive?
2010-11-17T18:28:26  <burny> did they fix the "line symetry, has all the 'middle' planets being on same side?" bug?
2010-11-17T18:28:31  <McLeopold> I'm 99% sure.  Review the logs here with me a Janzert
2010-11-17T18:28:50  <McLeopold> burny: I started that theory, and I think I was wrong.
2010-11-17T18:28:56  <McLeopold> burny: so no fix needed
2010-11-17T18:29:01  <burny> no, you aren't wrong
2010-11-17T18:29:48  <burny> unless it was fixed since the code I was shown
2010-11-17T18:30:06  <McLeopold> burny: we've reviewed the code extensivly and had many a math argument.  I positive it's a good, fair generator.
2010-11-17T18:30:22  <burny> ya, it's fair regardless
2010-11-17T18:30:25  <McLeopold> burny: any bias left is too small to worry about
2010-11-17T18:30:39  <burny> the bias is in the middle.. so it's equal for both teams
2010-11-17T18:30:42  <McLeopold> burny: the code was updated about 4 hours ago

2010-11-17T18:34:27  <IADaveMark> Figures.
2010-11-17T18:34:49  <IADaveMark> What's the easiest way to either log or debug a C++-based bot?
2010-11-17T18:35:09  <IADaveMark> Just for the helluvit I tried cout but that caused a timeout
2010-11-17T18:35:20  <Error323> IADaveMark: well i wrote my own assert functions with a logger
2010-11-17T18:35:29  <McLeopold> log4cpp ?
2010-11-17T18:35:32  <burny> dave, what level of debuging?
2010-11-17T18:35:49  <IADaveMark> Best case, I would love to step through my code. *hmpf*

2010-11-17T18:36:08  <burny> the 'best' way, is to write your own game emulator, and run AI vs AI locally, and have a graphical viewer, which includes visual metrics of the descision process

2010-11-17T18:36:43  <IADaveMark> I don't want to bother writing something new like an emulator
2010-11-17T18:36:43  <burny> same lol
2010-11-17T18:37:11  <IADaveMark> It's taken me this long to get around to writing a bot because I'm too busy writing AI for a living.
2010-11-17T18:37:18  <burny> I just changed/added like 20lines to the default AI, just to see how good/bad that will do
2010-11-17T18:37:38  <dmj111> IADaveMark: you can write a test driver to pass in one game state to your bot, and then catch it in the debugger.
2010-11-17T18:37:39  <Mjothvitnir> I just write to stderr and use planetwarrior (which shows stderr) or as sujjested you use a logger and write to a file
2010-11-17T18:37:58  <IADaveMark> PlanetWarrior is that thing I see on the forums that someone wrote?
2010-11-17T18:38:09  <Mjothvitnir> it is one of them yes
2010-11-17T18:38:21  <burny> well, I would wager that there exists a bot which consists of a variety of functions that just give huristics on planets/fleets. and plays a near perfect game in under 50lines
2010-11-17T18:38:32  <IADaveMark> So no way that people have found to simply step through the code, eh?
2010-11-17T18:38:42  <IADaveMark> Ack... brb... pizza
2010-11-17T18:38:59  <burny> "ack".. "pizza"?.. those words don't go together..
2010-11-17T18:39:09  <javagamer> Oh wow. The problem I'd been looking for the past half hour or so was I had int i = 0 when I meant to have i = 0 in a loop since I checked i after the loop.  I kept getting the value i previously was once the i I wanted went out of scope.
2010-11-17T18:39:32  <burny> ouch
2010-11-17T18:40:16  <Mjothvitnir> you need to make that error more often os it will rise higher on your list of things to check. ;-)
2010-11-17T18:40:52  <burny> or.. neer ever, make loop counter be outside of scope
2010-11-17T18:41:01  <burny> and explicitly set teh value inside the loop

2010-11-17T18:41:34  <Mjothvitnir> well, yeah, never making the error works too, I guess.
2010-11-17T18:41:40  <amstan> burny: hmm?
2010-11-17T18:42:33  <IADaveMark> Back... the "ack" was because I had to jump up to receive the aforementioned pizza
2010-11-17T18:43:00  <burny> <burny> but analyzing the play, there seems to be a counting error
2010-11-17T18:43:00  <burny> <burny> should I attempt to make my bot utilize this error: or give details to someone, so it can be fixed?
2010-11-17T18:43:07  <IADaveMark> So what do you use to log to a file? Any suggestions?
2010-11-17T18:43:35  <Zannick> burny: the three-way battle code? i thought i told you that was fine

2010-11-17T18:46:55  <Zannick> so, if you're okay with reading python, the engine code is here: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/engine.py
2010-11-17T18:47:19  <Zannick> you want lines 154-180, fight_battle
2010-11-17T18:47:57  <Zannick> landing fleets and defending fleets are added together by player, and the biggest fleet wins, subtracting the second biggest fleet
2010-11-17T18:48:10  <Zannick> if tied, result is 0 ships and owner doesn't change
2010-11-17T18:48:31  <Zannick> in short, yes, you can take advantage of knowledge of the game engine

2010-11-17T19:30:56  <bhasker_> need to find a way to figure out how to swap planets
2010-11-17T19:31:11  <bhasker_> there should be some way to make my bot say hey his planet has higher growth
2010-11-17T19:31:13  <bhasker_> let me swap
2010-11-17T19:31:13  <McLeopold> if growth > my_growth: do it
2010-11-17T19:31:23  <bhasker_> yea but sadly the way i decide available ships

2010-11-17T20:55:18  <antimatroid> no, i work out my net gain in ships from the move to the planet, so say i take a neutral, all growht is a gain, if i take the enemy, i double all growth i get for the payoff
2010-11-17T20:55:39  <antimatroid> but if it was already going to be owned by me at some times, i don't add that to the payoff for the move
2010-11-17T20:55:58  <antimatroid> that way i'm picking the moves that give the biggest change in net ships
2010-11-17T20:56:15  <antimatroid> it's fairly messy to implement it like that though
2010-11-17T20:59:43  <antimatroid> although, when i evaluate the bottom nodes of my tree, i just do that as a simple check of who would win if no more moves were made
2010-11-17T21:00:02  <antimatroid> and by how much
2010-11-17T21:00:21  <antimatroid> if a win/loss is certain, those get the extremal payoffs obviously

2010-11-17T21:03:14  <eburnette> I've tried trees of various heights from 1 to 99 and it seems the shorter the better. Maybe because enemy model is flawed.

2010-11-17T22:59:13  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm trying to do a map analysis to produce a nice even spread of map types.
2010-11-17T22:59:54  <McLeopold> eburnette + and - are the confidence interval for the elo score
2010-11-17T23:00:10  <McLeopold> so, your elo is the number give or take those 2 numbers

2010-11-17T23:00:52  <McLeopold> When someone plays 1 game and shoots to the top of the list, you'll see very high +/- numbers, indicating that there isn't high confidence that is the proper elo
2010-11-17T23:01:10  <McLeopold> score is percentage of wins
2010-11-17T23:01:16  <antimatroid> cool
2010-11-17T23:01:30  <McLeopold> oppo might be the average elo of opponents? not sure
2010-11-17T23:01:42  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so I've got a math question for you

2010-11-17T23:02:00  <McLeopold> if you have random numbers in the range 1-10...
2010-11-17T23:02:18  <eburnette> Ok, but I have a bot with elo72 +/- 34/35, and I play it a few games and watch the elo range from approx 200 to -100
2010-11-17T23:02:23  <McLeopold> the set of (2,5,8) would seem more evenly spread than the set (8,9,10)
2010-11-17T23:02:55  <burny> they're both equally evenly spread, and equally likely
2010-11-17T23:03:11  <McLeopold> Houndour.8a?

2010-11-17T23:04:25  <McLeopold> :)
2010-11-17T23:04:33  <burny> if they arne't equaly likely.. then one must be more probably
2010-11-17T23:04:45  * lavalamp_ facepalm
2010-11-17T23:04:47  <lavalamp_> ugh what a bug
2010-11-17T23:04:48  <McLeopold> what's the best way to return a value that indicates eveness?
2010-11-17T23:05:06  <eburnette> Chi squared?
2010-11-17T23:05:17  <burny> probably to just shape it, with standard deviation constraints
2010-11-17T23:05:32  <eburnette> stdev doesn't indicate evenness
2010-11-17T23:05:50  <McLeopold> eburnette: thx, I'll try that
2010-11-17T23:06:17  <McLeopold> once I understand it
2010-11-17T23:06:36  <burny> chi square is only a measure of randomness isn't it?
2010-11-17T23:06:43  <McLeopold> eburnette: your +/- is 147/138
2010-11-17T23:07:30  <eburnette> I was looking at a page I hadn't refreshed in a few min
2010-11-17T23:07:31  <McLeopold> plus, I think map types play so much of a role with so few games, that it is going to be diffucult to pin down an elo
2010-11-17T23:08:00  <Mjothvitnir> McL when you say "evenness" what do you mean?
2010-11-17T23:08:07  <burny> really though.. if you want to make maps conform to some sort of pattern..
2010-11-17T23:08:17  <McLeopold> well, for planet count, which is 15-30
2010-11-17T23:08:24  <burny> things like: the average, and std-dev of planet distances from each other
2010-11-17T23:08:32  <mega1> McLeopold: what do you want to do with it?
2010-11-17T23:08:33  <McLeopold> if we only had 16 maps, I would want 1 map with each number
2010-11-17T23:08:36  <burny> and surface area of largest non-planeted region, etc.
2010-11-17T23:09:04  <eburnette> McLeopold look at Infernape.8.1, it says +/- 34/35 but I guarantee you it will vary a lot more than that if I start it up
2010-11-17T23:09:12  <McLeopold> burny: those are great ideas for metrics
2010-11-17T23:09:23  <burny> the 15-30 are suposed to be equally likely?
2010-11-17T23:09:41  <antimatroid> bah, we needed to think about maps way earlier
2010-11-17T23:09:51  <McLeopold> eburnette: yeah, like I said, low game count and map types really mess with the math
2010-11-17T23:10:05  <McLeopold> eburnette: if this was tic-tac-toe, it would be a little more stable
2010-11-17T23:10:23  <antimatroid> if this was tic tac toe everyone would draw :P
2010-11-17T23:10:37  <McLeopold> I'm not going to push any maps stuff for the official contest.  This is just for my fun server.
2010-11-17T23:10:56  <McLeopold> Except RageTicTacToe
2010-11-17T23:11:00  <antimatroid> nxn tic tac toe ai might be interesting?
2010-11-17T23:11:12  <eburnette> I played 350 games on 100 maps, if it's not settling for that then how many does it take?
2010-11-17T23:11:49  <antimatroid> actually, that'd be pretty cool i think
2010-11-17T23:11:55  <McLeopold> eburnette: idk
2010-11-17T23:11:57  <McLeopold> sry
2010-11-17T23:11:58  <burny> from the way planets are generated.. about 20% of planets are useless
2010-11-17T23:12:11  <antimatroid> burny: yeah, often more too
2010-11-17T23:12:19  <burny> due to map size vs density vs regrowth
2010-11-17T23:12:19  <lavalamp_> antimatroid, that game exists, it's called gomoku or five in a row
2010-11-17T23:12:33  <burny> would expect more, half the time
2010-11-17T23:12:36  <antimatroid> isn't 5 in a row no more general than tic tac toe?
2010-11-17T23:12:39  <antimatroid> just a larger board?

2010-11-17T23:15:02  <burny> if it's nxn it's impossible to win above size2(unless the other perosn screws up), and 2 or less is imposible to lose

2010-11-17T23:18:46  <eburnette> Multi-threading should be allowed in future game
2010-11-17T23:19:05  <burny> multithreading is way harder for system admin
2010-11-17T23:19:24  <McLeopold> maybe 2 threads
2010-11-17T23:19:29  <burny> and is barely worth while(especially if you only get around 1second to make descision
2010-11-17T23:20:00  <McLeopold> they should just setup a bunch of ps3's with yellow dog and we each get 4 processors
2010-11-17T23:20:27  <eburnette> I think it would add another level to the challenge, and besides everybody needs to learn it

2010-11-17T23:28:27  <burny> the primary thing that this contest prevents 'real' AI from.. is you aren't allowed to write to files, or have any persistent data between games
