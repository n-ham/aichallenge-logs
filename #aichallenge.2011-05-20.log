2011-05-20T13:42:55  <demerzel> c/c++/c# that is
2011-05-20T13:42:59  <demerzel> or did you drop .net this year
2011-05-20T13:43:07  <amstan> demerzel: we have both c and c++
2011-05-20T13:43:16  <amstan> nobody succeeded in finishing a c# this year
2011-05-20T13:43:26  <demerzel> meaning you still need a starter package for C#?
2011-05-20T13:43:27  <amstan> we had volunteers, but they all lost interest after their first commit
2011-05-20T13:43:30  <amstan> yes
2011-05-20T13:43:48  <demerzel> what mono are you using?  same?
2011-05-20T13:43:55  <demerzel> heard there was a new one that supports 3.5
2011-05-20T13:43:56  <amstan> and most of them did not understand that we won't be using visual c# and they must test with mono
2011-05-20T13:44:08  <amstan> idk, latest in ubuntu 11.04
2011-05-20T13:44:18  <amstan> if you want another one, find a ppa
2011-05-20T13:44:34  <demerzel> i'm not that fluent in linux lol
2011-05-20T13:44:41  <demerzel> i'll just assume its the same as last year

2011-05-20T14:08:41  <amstan> maybe you can find the info on the wiki
2011-05-20T14:09:22  <demerzel> im reading that it just says damage is distributed and 1+ points is death
2011-05-20T14:10:16  <demerzel> im guessing its not cumulative and any battle has to beat 1+ points but i could be wrong

2011-05-20T15:01:37  <amstan> i was wondering what paint, lol
2011-05-20T15:02:49  <demerzel> amstan: i made account although you might not have wanted that any more

2011-05-20T15:03:10  <demerzel> you asked me to make an account
2011-05-20T15:03:12  <demerzel> i did
2011-05-20T15:03:16  <amstan> what about python?
2011-05-20T15:03:24  <demerzel> oh i am giving you shit
2011-05-20T15:03:25  <demerzel> i hate python
2011-05-20T15:03:44  <amstan> dude.. if you have something to deal with python, you have something to deal with me and mcleopold
2011-05-20T15:03:46  <amstan> lol
2011-05-20T15:03:57  <demerzel> specifically debugging python
2011-05-20T15:04:08  <jbroman> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THROWDOWN
2011-05-20T15:04:12  <amstan> debugging python is the easiest thing
2011-05-20T15:04:16  <McLeopold> demerzel: is it the enfored indentation, or the loose typing?
2011-05-20T15:04:21  <amstan> you don't even need a debugger for it
2011-05-20T15:04:22  <demerzel> loose typing
2011-05-20T15:04:25  <demerzel> and lack of dec
2011-05-20T15:04:30  <demerzel> oh look a variable
2011-05-20T15:04:32  <demerzel> it could be anything
2011-05-20T15:04:34  <demerzel> how NEAT
2011-05-20T15:05:04  <demerzel> i didn't know about enforced indentation
2011-05-20T15:05:06  <demerzel> how the helld oes that work
2011-05-20T15:05:11  <demerzel> replaces brackets?
2011-05-20T15:05:18  <McLeopold> yep
2011-05-20T15:05:22  <demerzel> wow
2011-05-20T15:05:25  <amstan> demerzel: what programming languages do you know?
2011-05-20T15:05:27  <demerzel> that seems unnecessarily annoying
2011-05-20T15:05:31  <demerzel> anything that starts with c
2011-05-20T15:05:38  <demerzel> except cobol
2011-05-20T15:05:38  <McLeopold> I think haskell does that as well to some extent
2011-05-20T15:05:39  <jbroman> demerzel: COBOL?
2011-05-20T15:05:43  <jbroman> (darn, too late)
2011-05-20T15:05:45  <demerzel> haha
2011-05-20T15:05:53  <demerzel> and java i guess
2011-05-20T15:06:02  <McLeopold> COBOL has enforced indentation too :p
2011-05-20T15:06:03  <amstan> that would explain it..
2011-05-20T15:06:04  <demerzel> i want to do a js bot but i don'tk now node
2011-05-20T15:06:16  <demerzel> does it really haha
2011-05-20T15:06:34  <demerzel> i am a bracket freak tho so thats fine by me
2011-05-20T15:06:37  <McLeopold> be careful, javascript is loosly typed too
2011-05-20T15:06:38  <jbroman> demerzel: Some people like indentation for scope (most people indent anyways, no need for closing braces), some people don't (it may conflict with your indentation style, it may be less easy to see when a block ends.
2011-05-20T15:06:41  <amstan> demerzel: you know javascript does the same thing with variables
2011-05-20T15:06:43  <demerzel> yea i like js though it's so amazing
2011-05-20T15:06:53  <demerzel> just the variety of ways you can use it always astounds me
2011-05-20T15:06:58  <jbroman> amstan: No, it doesn't.
2011-05-20T15:06:58  <demerzel> and every way works
2011-05-20T15:07:04  <jbroman> What JavaScript does is different (and stupider).
2011-05-20T15:07:16  <demerzel> its also more flexible
2011-05-20T15:07:20  <jbroman> If you refer to an undeclared variable, it is a property of the global object ("window" in browsers).
2011-05-20T15:07:32  <jbroman> Do not forget "var" in your JavaScript â it's not sugar.
2011-05-20T15:07:56  <jbroman> Other than that and a few other things, JavaScript is actually a rather nice language.
2011-05-20T15:07:58  <demerzel> i tend to just make everything an object attached to document
2011-05-20T15:08:02  <demerzel> it's an amazing language
2011-05-20T15:08:17  <jbroman> demerzel: It's dynamically-typed, you know. ;)
2011-05-20T15:08:20  <demerzel> yes i know
2011-05-20T15:08:25  <demerzel> but in a different way
2011-05-20T15:08:44  <demerzel> ie you can always expect it to be an object unless you specifically cast it to something
2011-05-20T15:09:02  <jbroman> demerzel: Huh? Numbers are not objects by default.
2011-05-20T15:09:14  <demerzel> operator casts it
2011-05-20T15:09:16  <demerzel> parseint
2011-05-20T15:09:18  <demerzel> iirc
2011-05-20T15:09:28  <McLeopold> O_o someone needs read a javascript spec
2011-05-20T15:09:43  <demerzel> its been a while since my web dev days i'm probably wrong then
2011-05-20T15:10:01  <McLeopold> you can't hate loose typing in one language, and love it in another, that's not consistent

2011-05-20T15:10:16  <demerzel> javascript is amazing in other ways though
2011-05-20T15:10:23  <amstan> demerzel: so far the only thing that's valid in your hate is indenting
2011-05-20T15:10:45  <demerzel> its also slow :p
2011-05-20T15:10:57  <McLeopold> the indenting is what drew me to python in the first place
2011-05-20T15:11:00  <amstan> why does it have to be fast? you don't understand its purpose then
2011-05-20T15:11:22  <McLeopold> haha, writing fast python just means making it a c library
2011-05-20T15:11:23  <amstan> if you want fast, use c, they're a great pair
2011-05-20T15:11:35  <demerzel> i dont' see the point in learning another syntax for the slowest compiled language just so you don't have to type
2011-05-20T15:11:38  <demerzel> what other advantages does it have
2011-05-20T15:11:59  <amstan> it's clean, easy to understand, fast to code in
2011-05-20T15:12:26  <demerzel> thats all subjective
2011-05-20T15:12:38  <demerzel> it's hard to read for me and fast to code in is completely dependent on the person
2011-05-20T15:12:45  <McLeopold> python
2011-05-20T15:12:45  <McLeopold> >>> import this
2011-05-20T15:13:10  <demerzel> i can hate on python all day don't engage me
2011-05-20T15:13:12  <amstan> demerzel: the subjective part is just familiarity, i get that
2011-05-20T15:13:33  <demerzel> the jquery of languages
2011-05-20T15:13:50  <amstan> anyway..

2011-05-20T15:14:27  <demerzel> should i just translate the c++ bot?
2011-05-20T15:14:34  <demerzel> iirc last year you tried to make all the functions etc the same
2011-05-20T15:15:00  <amstan> demerzel: last year, and the years before that c# was pretty much the java bot
2011-05-20T15:15:05  <demerzel> yea i could see that
2011-05-20T15:15:07  <McLeopold> demerzel: I hate on php, but when it comes down to it, every language has it's niche.  You should learn to appreciate what each one can do well.
2011-05-20T15:15:11  <amstan> with some changes so it would compiled
2011-05-20T15:15:14  <amstan> compile*
2011-05-20T15:15:21  <demerzel> yea i know i just still see zero value in python tbh
2011-05-20T15:15:23  <amstan> McLeopold: and in the case of php.... lol
2011-05-20T15:15:28  <demerzel> oh yea i c/p java into c# all the time
2011-05-20T15:15:33  <jbroman> McLeopold: Yay for the Switzerland position.
2011-05-20T15:15:34  <demerzel> is there a java bot that will be easy
2011-05-20T15:15:51  <amstan> demerzel: you should like us then, we're getting rid of php for the next contest, it'll be pure python
2011-05-20T15:16:04  <McLeopold> amstan: php is good for beginners who don't need to learn mvc :[
2011-05-20T15:16:12  <demerzel> php is ok
2011-05-20T15:16:31  <demerzel> it's annoying to jump back into because of remembering all the symbols and syntax again sucks
2011-05-20T15:16:49  <demerzel> but i respect it
2011-05-20T15:16:53  <demerzel> is there a java bot?
2011-05-20T15:17:08  <demerzel> oh nm there is
2011-05-20T15:17:12  <demerzel> hey cool ok i'll just translate it

2011-05-20T15:17:38  <McLeopold> Written by me, a python lover.  are you sure you want that as your base?
2011-05-20T15:17:48  <demerzel> i won't use it
2011-05-20T15:17:53  <amstan> lol!
2011-05-20T15:17:54  <demerzel> not going c#
2011-05-20T15:18:34  <demerzel> a python lover ugh
2011-05-20T15:18:43  <demerzel> rewriting from scratch then
2011-05-20T15:19:14  <McLeopold> Jython?
2011-05-20T15:19:16  <amstan> demerzel: also, your c# code is going to have to interface through stdio to a python program
2011-05-20T15:19:46  <demerzel> are you giving me shit about python or is this different than the stdio from last year
2011-05-20T15:20:00  <amstan> nah, it's the same
2011-05-20T15:20:01  <jbroman> demerzel: stdio is stdio.
2011-05-20T15:20:18  <demerzel> yea i know i wasn't sure what 'interface thorugh stdio' meant there
2011-05-20T15:20:26  <demerzel> last year it was python too haha i rewrote the engine in c
2011-05-20T15:20:40  <demerzel> the engine was anyway
2011-05-20T15:20:41  <amstan> oh, so you're one of those ppl
2011-05-20T15:21:17  <demerzel> only so i could readi t better
2011-05-20T15:21:23  <amstan> ok, :)
2011-05-20T15:21:24  <demerzel> idk what it is about python but it is really hard to read for me
2011-05-20T15:21:45  <McLeopold> that's strange, because one of the goals is readability
2011-05-20T15:21:54  <demerzel> something about the way it flows makes it hard for me to instantly recognize functionality
2011-05-20T15:22:16  <demerzel> its just different prob but i haven't had that problem with any other language
2011-05-20T15:22:45  <McLeopold> what editor do you use?  syntax highlighting makes a big difference
2011-05-20T15:24:17  <demerzel> for python?  notepad++ i guess
2011-05-20T15:24:28  <McLeopold> well, for anything
2011-05-20T15:24:36  <demerzel> vs usually except intellij for php/java
2011-05-20T15:24:51  <demerzel> umm mcleopold the java is your bot right?
2011-05-20T15:24:55  <amstan> how do i disable the jails?

2011-05-20T15:26:02  <demerzel> can just be a static class

2011-05-20T15:28:39  <demerzel> how weird actually loking at it
2011-05-20T15:28:46  <demerzel> so you refer to a class instance and the enum simultaneously
2011-05-20T15:28:50  <McLeopold> amstan: add --debug

2011-05-20T15:34:12  <demerzel> your java usage is too language-specific i'm just gonna write it off cpp

2011-05-20T16:10:42  <McLeopold> (which is inconsistent with manager.py....)
2011-05-20T16:11:04  <McLeopold> -n is number of tasks, which defaults to 1
2011-05-20T16:11:09  <McLeopold> 0 means forever
2011-05-20T16:12:23  <McLeopold> amstan: you should get compterwiz_222 to style the tables now...
2011-05-20T16:12:33  <amstan> nah, i should be the one doing them
2011-05-20T16:12:47  <amstan> he was doing mostly the high level design

2011-05-20T16:18:24  <McLeopold> this is only 5 players...
2011-05-20T16:18:34  <antimatroid> i don't mind longer games personally, but it may require a slightly longer contest
2011-05-20T16:18:49  <McLeopold> maybe if we take off serialization, it would be faster?
2011-05-20T16:19:03  <antimatroid> i think we're kidding ourselves trying maps larger than like 120x120 though, just because you need to give sufficient time for a game to reasonably play out
2011-05-20T16:19:53  <antimatroid> i also have a problem with my timer in the c++ bot, in that it seems most windows compilers don't have gettimeofday :(
2011-05-20T16:19:59  <antimatroid> it used to work for me on windows with mingw
2011-05-20T16:20:18  <McLeopold> windows won't give you the time of day? how rude

2011-05-20T16:21:26  <McLeopold> I think play_game is much faster.

2011-05-20T17:09:52  <demerzel> oh wow it's 4 players?  i didn't know that
2011-05-20T17:09:57  <amstan> demerzel: yes, the tables are not expected to work
2011-05-20T17:09:58  <demerzel> thought it would be 1v1
2011-05-20T17:10:07  <demerzel> figured but thought i'd tell you anyway
2011-05-20T17:11:04  <demerzel> those maps are huge too wow
2011-05-20T17:11:08  <demerzel> neato visualizer
2011-05-20T17:11:11  <antimatroid> it's not 4 players
2011-05-20T17:11:11  <antimatroid> it
2011-05-20T17:11:14  <antimatroid> s n players
2011-05-20T17:11:27  <demerzel> no max?
2011-05-20T17:11:34  <antimatroid> 26 is a hard limit
2011-05-20T17:11:38  <demerzel> interesting
2011-05-20T17:11:39  <antimatroid> cause of the map format
2011-05-20T17:11:50  <antimatroid> but i don't expect to use anywhere near that many
2011-05-20T17:11:58  <demerzel> i thought this would be much simpler than planetwars but it appears to be much more complex lol
2011-05-20T17:12:15  <demerzel> does the engine tell the players whose ants are whose other than mine/notmine?
2011-05-20T17:12:20  <demerzel> i assume nto judging by starter bots but not sure
2011-05-20T17:12:24  <antimatroid> yes
2011-05-20T17:12:30  <antimatroid> first enemy you see is player one, and so on
2011-05-20T17:12:30  <demerzel> oh damn ok
2011-05-20T17:12:42  <demerzel> dynamic players even interesting
2011-05-20T17:12:45  <demerzel> sheesh
2011-05-20T17:15:50  <antimatroid> you realise the edges are wrapped too yeah?
2011-05-20T17:15:57  <antimatroid> so you're essentially playing on a discrete torus

2011-05-20T17:43:17  <okayzed> demerzel_, simpler in mechanics or writing an AI?
2011-05-20T17:43:29  <demerzel_> writing an ai
2011-05-20T17:43:55  <demerzel_> mechanics are not too bad considering we had to keep track of distances and varying spawns etc in planetwars
2011-05-20T17:44:09  <demerzel_> the ai will probably be much more 'real ai' friendly in this though
2011-05-20T17:44:14  <demerzel_> as opposed to heuristic
2011-05-20T17:44:39  <demerzel_> not that heuristics wont work i just could actually see an organic ai attempt
2011-05-20T17:44:46  <demerzel_> i couldn't see that in planetwars

2011-05-20T18:06:17  <demerzel_> i guess it would just send 'go' since nothing is visible if you have 0 ants
2011-05-20T18:06:26  <McLeopold> so it kills it

2011-05-20T20:02:19  <McLeopold> well, meant I needed to get more test bots, but I wasn't refering to writing more

2011-05-20T22:02:45  <amstan> yes
2011-05-20T22:02:46  <demerzel> i did notice that games were only playing to like 20 turns or something
2011-05-20T22:02:49  <amstan> was it working or something?
2011-05-20T22:02:56  <demerzel> yea it was working up until a minute ago
2011-05-20T22:03:06  <demerzel> i was trying to upload the C# starter package to see if it would work this time
2011-05-20T22:03:10  <demerzel> keep getting 'failed tests'
2011-05-20T22:03:30  <amstan> demerzel: did mcleopold did something to it to make it work?
2011-05-20T22:03:37  <demerzel> do something to what
2011-05-20T22:03:43  <demerzel> C# was compiling it said
2011-05-20T22:03:52  <amstan> when i left the worker was broken
2011-05-20T22:03:55  <demerzel> said it compiled successfully but failed tests
2011-05-20T22:04:03  <amstan> and not only that, but it's not made to start automatically
2011-05-20T22:04:24  <demerzel> idk what worker's scope is
2011-05-20T22:04:37  <amstan> the workers compile and run games
2011-05-20T22:04:43  <amstan> yeah.. ok
2011-05-20T22:04:46  <amstan> my bad
2011-05-20T22:04:50  <amstan> apparently mcleopold had it running
2011-05-20T22:04:51  <demerzel> oh now it's just sitting there
2011-05-20T22:04:55  <demerzel> ready to be compiled
2011-05-20T22:05:00  <demerzel> but it was running earlier
2011-05-20T22:05:52  <demerzel> do you have an offline tester
2011-05-20T22:05:56  <demerzel> how did you vet teh starter packages
2011-05-20T22:06:38  <demerzel> or just start worker when you feel like it ;)
2011-05-20T22:06:41  <ahmedhelal> amstan: hey
2011-05-20T22:06:50  <amstan> ahmedhelal: yes?
2011-05-20T22:07:16  <ahmedhelal> seems like you are almost done with game, i'hve been away for a while, when i came today i saw the visualizer and website
2011-05-20T22:07:37  <amstan> ahmedhelal: yes, i also noticed that you hate the design?
2011-05-20T22:08:29  <ahmedhelal> yeah i was just gonna ask if thats final design
2011-05-20T22:08:43  <amstan> ahmedhelal: mostly
2011-05-20T22:08:51  <amstan> demerzel: k, i think it's up
2011-05-20T22:09:16  <ahmedhelal> amstan: is there any chance that i could work on a new design ? at least same layout (so that i dont waste any work done)..
2011-05-20T22:09:29  <amstan> ahmedhelal: come up with a mockup and we'll see
2011-05-20T22:09:37  <amstan> i've been asking ppl for months about a new design
2011-05-20T22:09:49  *** Blkt`` <Blkt``!~Blkt@dynamic-adsl-94-34-39-183.clienti.tiscali.it> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-05-20T22:09:49  <amstan> eventually i got the current one, people around here liked it
2011-05-20T22:10:07  <ahmedhelal> i was away really , but when i saw current one i was shocked, if anyone see the title "google ai contest" and those colors he will most probably think its a fake website
2011-05-20T22:10:42  <ahmedhelal> i mean from design point of view, it looks amateur or more of a personal website, not a contest one , with all do respect :)
2011-05-20T22:11:14  <amstan> ahmedhelal: the old one wasn't much better, is was downloaded from a "free professional designs" website
2011-05-20T22:11:24  <amstan> we were happy that we got a theme
2011-05-20T22:11:53  <qacek> amstan: I wrote a haskell starter bot from scratch, I commented on the issue on github, but no one responded. If you think it's up to snuff I'd be willing to submit it.
2011-05-20T22:12:15  <ahmedhelal> well i think a pro design could take the contest to a new level, attracing more ppl to compete, universities, etc..
2011-05-20T22:12:23  <amstan> qacek: link?
2011-05-20T22:12:30  <amstan> ahmedhelal: sure, fire away

2011-05-20T22:12:53  <ahmedhelal> amstan: any deadlines for me ? i know you need it asap but just give me a line to organize my schedule based on it
2011-05-20T22:12:55  <demerzel> amstan: can you give me more detail on this?  May 20th 22:04:18 	compiled successfully but failed test cases 	C#
2011-05-20T22:13:01  <demerzel> i really have no idea
2011-05-20T22:13:11  <demerzel> looked at my c# i put out last year and it does the same shit
2011-05-20T22:13:18  <amstan> ahmedhelal: we did the current one in like 3 days
2011-05-20T22:13:19  <demerzel> works fine when i feed it the sample input
2011-05-20T22:13:22  <amstan> ahmedhelal: you probably have a week
2011-05-20T22:13:35  <amstan> demerzel: hmm
2011-05-20T22:13:44  <demerzel> i tried just typing
2011-05-20T22:13:52  <demerzel> ready\ngo\n and it fed back go\n
2011-05-20T22:13:54  <demerzel> so i have no idea
2011-05-20T22:14:09  <demerzel> then i fed it that sample data and it gave back good data
2011-05-20T22:14:20  <demerzel> so i thoguht maybe it's a linux linefeed thing and made all the lineends manual

2011-05-20T22:15:21  <demerzel> hmm
2011-05-20T22:15:28  <demerzel> so is there just not a test case for C# yet
2011-05-20T22:15:33  <demerzel> or a condition for it?
2011-05-20T22:15:34  <amstan> demerzel: k.. pausing the worker
2011-05-20T22:15:36  <computerwiz_222> I've been away for a while, how are things?

2011-05-20T22:16:05  <amstan> demerzel: hopefully the next task the worker will compile yours

2011-05-20T22:16:43  <amstan> probably crashed or something
2011-05-20T22:16:50  <amstan> demerzel: are you testing your bot locally?
2011-05-20T22:16:53  <amstan> against others?
2011-05-20T22:17:02  <demerzel> no i don't know where offline stuff is
2011-05-20T22:17:08  <amstan> the contest framework is really not designed to debug your bot
2011-05-20T22:17:18  <amstan> demerzel: see play_one_game.sh/bat

2011-05-20T22:18:07  <amstan> Nebri: seems to be doing ok
2011-05-20T22:18:12  <demerzel> what python version are you using
2011-05-20T22:18:21  <amstan> demerzel: 2.7, but should work with 2.6  fine
2011-05-20T22:18:26  <demerzel> ty
2011-05-20T22:18:35  <amstan> computerwiz_222: yo
2011-05-20T22:18:45  <computerwiz_222> amstan: you made the "Sign Up" bigger?
2011-05-20T22:18:46  <amstan> ahmedhelal: computerwiz_222 did the current design
2011-05-20T22:18:52  <amstan> computerwiz_222: that was mcleopold
2011-05-20T22:18:53  <Nebri> amstan: obviously no dates have been announced yet, around what date would you guys like to be up and running at?
2011-05-20T22:18:54  <computerwiz_222> looks cool
2011-05-20T22:18:56  <amstan> computerwiz_222: i agree, it's annoying
2011-05-20T22:19:00  <computerwiz_222> no, i like it
2011-05-20T22:19:01  <amstan> computerwiz_222: aww
2011-05-20T22:19:01  <computerwiz_222> well..
2011-05-20T22:19:02  <amstan> ok
2011-05-20T22:19:03  <computerwiz_222> wait.
2011-05-20T22:19:10  <computerwiz_222> yeah, fine
2011-05-20T22:19:13  <computerwiz_222> i agree with amstan
2011-05-20T22:19:14  <computerwiz_222> lol
2011-05-20T22:19:20  <amstan> it seems a little in the eyes, but it's ok
2011-05-20T22:19:27  <amstan> Nebri: no idea, honestly
2011-05-20T22:19:48  <computerwiz_222> it seems like "you could sign in.. but there is this way better thing called signing up, and it's bigger so it must be better"
2011-05-20T22:19:49  <amstan> Nebri: i'm just trying to get the contest in a usable state thus far
2011-05-20T22:20:15  <amstan> demerzel: got it working?
2011-05-20T22:20:26  <Nebri> amstan: fair enough :)
2011-05-20T22:20:29  <demerzel> not yet still trying
2011-05-20T22:20:33  <amstan> qacek: ok.. sorry, i forgot about you, did you test your bot?
2011-05-20T22:20:58  <amstan> qacek: here, this should actually work: zip everything and upload it here: http://hypertriangle.com:13080/rankings.php
2011-05-20T22:21:07  <demerzel> the .cmd points to .py files
2011-05-20T22:21:10  <demerzel> ie hunterbot.py
2011-05-20T22:21:14  <demerzel> can i chagne to .exe?
2011-05-20T22:21:28  <amstan> demerzel: yes, remove one of the python ones and replace with your exe
2011-05-20T22:21:33  <demerzel> ok ty
2011-05-20T22:22:43  <qacek> amstan: I tried it with the play_one_game.sh and it behaved as the starter guide specifies
2011-05-20T22:22:58  <amstan> qacek: well, aren't you curious on how it does on the server?
2011-05-20T22:23:05  <amstan> qacek: it's the real deal, without the sandbox!
2011-05-20T22:23:12  <amstan> nobody hack in pls!
2011-05-20T22:23:20  <qacek> amstan: I wasn't aware of the server?
2011-05-20T22:23:38  <amstan> qacek: anyway, you can play with it, while i add your submodule in the contest repo
2011-05-20T22:23:42  <qacek> I suppose I should make sure it works with your version of ghc
2011-05-20T22:23:44  * computerwiz_222 TIME TO HACK
2011-05-20T22:26:05  <computerwiz_222> amstan: is this server running on your htpc still?
2011-05-20T22:26:08  <amstan> computerwiz_222: yes
2011-05-20T22:26:15  <amstan> computerwiz_222: where else? lol
2011-05-20T22:27:03  <computerwiz_222> amstan: i dunno, i thought you had sponsored servers
2011-05-20T22:27:11  <amstan> computerwiz_222: yeah.. tell me about it
2011-05-20T22:27:21  * amstan looks at j3camero
2011-05-20T22:27:22  <computerwiz_222> i sponsor my pentium 4 :D
2011-05-20T22:27:31  <amstan> computerwiz_222: i doubt it could do better than my htpc
2011-05-20T22:27:37  <computerwiz_222> probably can't
2011-05-20T22:27:52  <computerwiz_222> amstan: but it can definitely store more stuff :D
2011-05-20T22:28:04  <computerwiz_222> never fear, let your mysql database grow to 2.5TB, should be fine
2011-05-20T22:28:13  <qacek> if i'm not a student can I select my alma mater :P
2011-05-20T22:28:24  <computerwiz_222> your elementary school?
2011-05-20T22:28:26  <amstan> qacek: probably
2011-05-20T22:28:30  <computerwiz_222> oh
2011-05-20T22:28:31  <Nebri> amstan: what stage in development is the ants competiton at currently? do you guys have a beta/working prototype yet?
2011-05-20T22:28:32  <computerwiz_222> ic

2011-05-20T22:28:55  <demerzel> getting a python error :(
2011-05-20T22:29:10  <amstan> demerzel: if you could pastebin it... that would help
2011-05-20T22:29:23  <computerwiz_222> amstan: yes! Mohawk College!

2011-05-20T22:29:59  <demerzel> i don't know jack about python
2011-05-20T22:30:18  <amstan> qacek: so i'm going to be adding your repo as a submodule, that means that the main repo will like your repo at a specific commit number, it won't update automatically
2011-05-20T22:30:29  <amstan> whenever you update it, i'll have to know if it is to update in the main repo
2011-05-20T22:30:33  <Nebri> hehe I'm currently attending Mohawk College right now
2011-05-20T22:30:46  <Nebri> amstan: if your at mohawk college, did you make an entry for amazebot 2011?
2011-05-20T22:31:01  <amstan> Nebri: yes, i do remember your name on those forums
2011-05-20T22:31:08  <computerwiz_222> Nebri: amstan and myself did
2011-05-20T22:31:35  <Nebri> hehe, now I'm really curious which bot did you guys put in? I'm one of the creators of Robotnik :)
2011-05-20T22:31:38  <demerzel> amstan: nm i got it it's just it didn't like the relative directory
2011-05-20T22:31:41  <amstan> Nebri: pathfinder
2011-05-20T22:31:43  <computerwiz_222> Nebri: we created pathfinder
2011-05-20T22:31:44  <demerzel> amstan: ok it appears to be working??
2011-05-20T22:31:58  <Nebri> ah okies! now I know exactly who you guys are :P
2011-05-20T22:32:09  <computerwiz_222> Nebri: mostly amstan, but I helped come up with some concepts that saved us (kind of..)
2011-05-20T22:32:10  <qacek> amstan: is irc the best way to let you know if I make an update?
2011-05-20T22:32:10  <amstan> demerzel: at the end of it, you should get a browser pop up
2011-05-20T22:32:29  <amstan> qacek: or issues or pull requests if you want them to be in writing
2011-05-20T22:32:37  <qacek> ok
2011-05-20T22:32:54  <computerwiz_222> Nebri: we had an awful bug.. it just happened to affect the maps that were selected. Next year, we are entering again.
2011-05-20T22:33:05  <Nebri> excellent, I'm currently in talks with Aravin to bring a new AI contest to mohawk.
2011-05-20T22:33:14  <computerwiz_222> very cool
2011-05-20T22:33:16  <demerzel> amstan: i did - apparently my bot sucks but it is working http://pastebin.com/k3uU02bX
2011-05-20T22:33:32  <demerzel> amstan: although the popup didn't point to anywhere useful lol
2011-05-20T22:33:42  <amstan> demerzel: didn't you see the game?
2011-05-20T22:33:50  <Nebri> good to hear. We've already scrapped Robotnik and we're working on a completely new solution that is performing loads better, we'll be entering again under a new bot name :)
2011-05-20T22:34:02  <demerzel> oh nm noscript blocked it haha
2011-05-20T22:34:05  <demerzel> yea i do now
2011-05-20T22:34:14  <amstan> demerzel: if it crashes, that would do
2011-05-20T22:34:31  <demerzel> amstan: what do you mean?  it would sit there?
2011-05-20T22:34:39  <amstan> maybe, i'm not sure
2011-05-20T22:34:47  <demerzel> it sat there for 58 turns in the replay haha
2011-05-20T22:34:50  <demerzel> but it was there
2011-05-20T22:34:54  <amstan> that could be the problem them
2011-05-20T22:34:55  <amstan> then*
2011-05-20T22:34:57  <amstan> make it work!
2011-05-20T22:36:33  <demerzel> it doesn'th elp i have zero feedback mechanisms
2011-05-20T22:36:36  <demerzel> even with the local
2011-05-20T22:36:56  <demerzel> i would assume if it didn't at least say 'go\n' it would get booted in 2000 ms
2011-05-20T22:37:21  <computerwiz_222> the current instructions on getting started seem to be very focused on java, are there plans to expand these?
2011-05-20T22:38:23  <CIA-48> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * r519a90d / (.gitmodules ants/dist/starter_bots/haskell): added haskell starter bot - http://bit.ly/l1AijS
2011-05-20T22:38:32  <amstan> computerwiz_222: yes, they're old
2011-05-20T22:38:35  <qacek> amstan: looks like the server is able to run my bot
2011-05-20T22:38:36  <amstan> qacek: there we go
2011-05-20T22:39:22  <demerzel> amstan: can any of that test stuff tell me what is actually going stdin/stdout or do i have to roll my own
2011-05-20T22:39:33  <amstan> demerzel: you should roll your own
2011-05-20T22:39:39  <demerzel> crappo
2011-05-20T22:39:50  <demerzel> ok then
2011-05-20T22:39:51  <amstan> demerzel: actually.. you can use tee
2011-05-20T22:40:07  <demerzel> its ok i would have rolled my own at some point anyway haha
2011-05-20T22:40:09  <amstan> demerzel: you on linux?
2011-05-20T22:40:11  <demerzel> no
2011-05-20T22:40:15  <amstan> demerzel: nvm ten
2011-05-20T22:40:28  <demerzel> i'll make an offline visualizer/debugger
2011-05-20T22:40:29  <demerzel> why not
2011-05-20T22:40:33  <qacek> wouldn't cygwin work?
2011-05-20T22:40:42  <amstan> demerzel: there is an offline visualizer
2011-05-20T22:40:43  <demerzel> i deal with enough cygwin linux shelling at work
2011-05-20T22:40:49  <demerzel> where is it
2011-05-20T22:40:53  <antimatroid> is this with c++?
2011-05-20T22:40:55  <amstan> demerzel: ants/visualizer
2011-05-20T22:41:04  <antimatroid> the timer for the c++ bot wont work for all windows compilers
2011-05-20T22:41:08  <amstan> antimatroid: he's making c#
2011-05-20T22:41:09  <antimatroid> i'm not sure what i'm going to do about that yet
2011-05-20T22:41:13  <antimatroid> ah okay, sorry :P
2011-05-20T22:41:13  <demerzel> no i'm writing a c# cuz they didn't have one
2011-05-20T22:41:15  <amstan> antimatroid: and wants to debug it
2011-05-20T22:41:16  <demerzel> my actual bot will be c haha
2011-05-20T22:41:40  <antimatroid> demerzel: want to work out how i can do a timer that is os agnostic in c++ for me? :P
2011-05-20T22:41:51  <amstan> demerzel: see visualize_locally.py
2011-05-20T22:41:58  <demerzel> yea that's replay only
2011-05-20T22:42:00  <demerzel> oh well
2011-05-20T22:42:03  <amstan> demerzel: you give it a game on stdin, and opens a ..

2011-05-20T22:42:14  <amstan> yes, replay, how else?
2011-05-20T22:42:20  <demerzel> antimatroid: i used a pretty simple one last year
2011-05-20T22:42:32  <demerzel> amstan: realtime visualizer/debugger is what i meant
2011-05-20T22:42:36  <amstan> oh, yeah
2011-05-20T22:42:48  <amstan> we were thinking about streaming support for the visualizer, but eventually gave up
2011-05-20T22:42:55  <amstan> since json wouldn't work well in that situation
2011-05-20T22:42:58  <demerzel> antimatroid: but honestly you don't need a timer if you're using c++
2011-05-20T22:43:02  <antimatroid> yes you do
2011-05-20T22:43:11  <demerzel> what kind of math are you pulling lol
2011-05-20T22:43:19  <antimatroid> a stupid food collection algorithm will eat a second up this time
2011-05-20T22:43:27  <demerzel> i did some ungodly amounts of calcs most of which i didn't even use in under a second
2011-05-20T22:43:31  <demerzel> oh
2011-05-20T22:43:37  <antimatroid> the bot i have doing some basic things already needs to stop calculating once it reaches a second
2011-05-20T22:43:39  <demerzel> yea i haven't even looked at strat yet
2011-05-20T22:43:48  <demerzel> amstan: i can make one but it will be .NET hahaha
2011-05-20T22:43:55  <demerzel> i'll be damned if i'm making an os-agnostic gui
2011-05-20T22:44:02  <demerzel> too much work
2011-05-20T22:44:10  * amstan pulls up analytics
2011-05-20T22:44:20  <antimatroid> i just need an os agnostic timer :P
2011-05-20T22:44:39  <demerzel> hrm lemme see if the timer function is still in mine
2011-05-20T22:44:43  <demerzel> it worked fine last year
2011-05-20T22:44:48  <antimatroid> :)
2011-05-20T22:45:07  <amstan> demerzel: you'll be missing out on 33% of the users
2011-05-20T22:45:11  <antimatroid> gettimeofday always worked for me on windows, but i used mingw which is more linuxy i think (i'm a complete noob about that kind of thing)
2011-05-20T22:45:14  <demerzel> i still have my vanilla C socket code from dhartmei's server
2011-05-20T22:45:31  <demerzel> amstan: i wouldn't say i am missing out on them more like they arem issing out
2011-05-20T22:45:36  <demerzel> unless i'm secretly farming their data haha
2011-05-20T22:45:46  <amstan> demerzel: including a bunch of organizers
2011-05-20T22:45:57  <antimatroid> a jbotmanager equivalent would be mega
2011-05-20T22:46:02  <demerzel> mono could probably run it
2011-05-20T22:46:13  <demerzel> i had people running some utility i made for mount&blade in linux
2011-05-20T22:46:13  <amstan> i'm not installing that stuff, lol
2011-05-20T22:46:19  <amstan> test server, i'll allow
2011-05-20T22:46:21  <demerzel> well i'm not pandering to your os :P
2011-05-20T22:46:29  <amstan> you could if you were coding in python
2011-05-20T22:46:36  <demerzel> if i was coding in python i wouldn't be me
2011-05-20T22:46:42  <demerzel> might as well do it on my macbook
2011-05-20T22:47:22  <antimatroid> amstan: is there still an 8 character limit on passwords?
2011-05-20T22:47:28  <amstan> computerwiz_222: we must make these prettier: http://hypertriangle.com:13080/profile.php?user=7
2011-05-20T22:47:37  <amstan> computerwiz_222: same with the rankings page, any ideas?
2011-05-20T22:47:41  <amstan> antimatroid: there is???
2011-05-20T22:47:46  <antimatroid> there was last week
2011-05-20T22:48:18  <amstan> antimatroid: works just fine for 12
2011-05-20T22:48:23  <amstan> last week was the same
2011-05-20T22:48:29  <antimatroid> it required me to have at least 8
2011-05-20T22:48:33  <antimatroid> i wasn't allowed 7
2011-05-20T22:48:40  <amstan> oh.. at least, probably
2011-05-20T22:48:44  <amstan> i tought you said at most
2011-05-20T22:48:52  <amstan> i would support removing least though
2011-05-20T22:49:48  <demerzel> antimatroid: sorry don't see it must have removed it
2011-05-20T22:49:59  <demerzel> iirc it was clock_t with some kind of ifdef
2011-05-20T22:50:18  <demerzel> but it's been too long i'd have to google
2011-05-20T22:50:38  <amstan> computerwiz_222: want a task?
2011-05-20T22:51:57  <demerzel> why does the js visualizer wrap the map
2011-05-20T22:52:03  <demerzel> i mean it literally makes a mirror
2011-05-20T22:52:12  <amstan> demerzel: it's not mirror, it's wrapping
2011-05-20T22:52:14  <demerzel> i see 3 maps
2011-05-20T22:52:26  <amstan> and that's because the actual map is wrapped
2011-05-20T22:52:31  <antimatroid> demerzel: it's a tesselation on a torus
2011-05-20T22:52:34  <demerzel> yea but it looks very weird
2011-05-20T22:52:39  <antimatroid> also, i think c_time might be using cpu time?
2011-05-20T22:52:43  <demerzel> i don't know what that means but i am guessing its intentinoal now
2011-05-20T22:52:49  <demerzel> time.h clock_t
2011-05-20T22:52:53  <amstan> demerzel: have you seen a 4d cube? they're weird eh?
2011-05-20T22:52:55  <antimatroid> ergh, that
2011-05-20T22:53:00  <antimatroid> i googles the reference :P
2011-05-20T22:53:02  <jbroman> demerzel: The game is played on a torus (i.e. the left side wraps to the right, and the top to the bottom)
2011-05-20T22:53:22  <jbroman> Or, if you prefer, the ants are on a donut.
2011-05-20T22:53:24  <antimatroid> if you translate a map r_translate and c_translate times, you get the same map again
2011-05-20T22:54:20  <ahmedhelal> amstan: McLeopold had nicer looking tables http://tcp.zeroviz.us/
2011-05-20T22:54:21  <amstan> qacek: http://hypertriangle.com:13080/starter_packages/haskell_starter_package.zip
2011-05-20T22:54:42  <amstan> ahmedhelal: yes, that's because i have a reset and no other markup on that table
2011-05-20T22:54:45  <demerzel> i think there's some kind of 'ticks per second' cosntant in both unix-based and win-based
2011-05-20T22:54:47  <amstan> except make th's cool
2011-05-20T22:54:54  <demerzel> you just clock_t with that and you're os-agnostic
2011-05-20T22:54:58  <demerzel> i don't remember what it is
2011-05-20T22:55:37  <antimatroid> amstan: why is there no food on hypertriangle? :P
2011-05-20T22:55:41  <ahmedhelal> amstan: ill work on some sketches for that in my mockup
2011-05-20T22:55:49  <amstan> antimatroid: there should be
2011-05-20T22:55:53  <amstan> ahmedhelal: ok, decent
2011-05-20T22:56:44  <antimatroid> amstan: It would be really awesome if you could remove "(Australia)" off the end of the organisation "University of Tasmania (Australia)" :P
2011-05-20T22:56:53  <amstan> antimatroid: interesting... no food
2011-05-20T22:56:54  <antimatroid> it's there from a miscommunication when i asked for the orgnisation from tron :P

2011-05-20T22:58:12  <amstan> antimatroid: test server won't get updated right away though
2011-05-20T22:58:21  <antimatroid> cheers :)
2011-05-20T22:58:49  <amstan> antimatroid: you could have done that yourself you know.. lol
2011-05-20T22:58:53  <amstan> you have push access
2011-05-20T22:59:07  <antimatroid> if i knew how :P
2011-05-20T22:59:08  <qacek> amstan: just curious but is the server still using ghc 6.8.2 or is that a relic from planetwars?
2011-05-20T22:59:26  <amstan> server does something weird
2011-05-20T22:59:34  <amstan> wait... how does the server work?
2011-05-20T22:59:41  <amstan> it should have crashed with haskell
2011-05-20T22:59:44  <amstan> oh, nvm
2011-05-20T22:59:47  <amstan> it's not using the sandbox
2011-05-20T23:00:02  <qacek> my bot isn't sandboxed?
2011-05-20T23:00:03  <amstan> qacek: yes, the haskell story is long
2011-05-20T23:00:07  <antimatroid> am i meant to upload the make file with my bot?
2011-05-20T23:00:14  <qacek> ok
2011-05-20T23:00:15  <amstan> qacek: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/haskell-on-natty/INSTALL_haskell.md
2011-05-20T23:00:17  <antimatroid> it's saying compilling submissions :P
2011-05-20T23:00:24  <amstan> qacek: the default haskell in ubuntu is broken
2011-05-20T23:00:33  <amstan> antimatroid: it's running a game now
2011-05-20T23:00:43  <antimatroid> :)
2011-05-20T23:00:45  <amstan> antimatroid: no compilations
2011-05-20T23:00:48  <amstan> so idk
2011-05-20T23:01:02  <antimatroid> oh wait, nevermind
2011-05-20T23:01:23  <amstan> antimatroid: there's food now: http://hypertriangle.com:13080/
2011-05-20T23:02:07  <antimatroid> cool
2011-05-20T23:02:10  <antimatroid> i am compiled
2011-05-20T23:02:13  <ahmedhelal> amstan: can i use google's logo in my design ? or should i write google plainly ?
2011-05-20T23:02:15  <antimatroid> let's see how my collector bot does
2011-05-20T23:02:21  <qacek> cool looks like you guys are using the same version as me
2011-05-20T23:02:25  <amstan> ahmedhelal: apparently we cannot
2011-05-20T23:02:30  <amstan> ahmedhelal: write it plainly
2011-05-20T23:02:59  <jbroman> Using the logo would imply more association than actually exists, even if the legal issues didn't exist.
2011-05-20T23:04:28  <antimatroid> ergh, wth :s

2011-05-20T23:08:45  <antimatroid> although my starter is slightly altered
2011-05-20T23:08:53  <antimatroid> but only because i removed the r lines
2011-05-20T23:09:04  <amstan> did you zip right?
2011-05-20T23:09:07  <antimatroid> i was waiting to reupload until i worked out how to fix the timer too
2011-05-20T23:09:08  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-05-20T23:09:12  <antimatroid> should have
2011-05-20T23:09:13  <amstan> it has to be in this format: http://hypertriangle.com:13080/starter_packages/cpp_starter_package.zip
2011-05-20T23:09:29  <amstan> the one there doesn't have a folder inside
2011-05-20T23:11:22  <antimatroid> okay that worked
2011-05-20T23:11:31  <antimatroid> strange, with the past contests i always zipped the folder up
2011-05-20T23:11:50  <amstan> submit a bug report
2011-05-20T23:11:53  <amstan> that should have worked
2011-05-20T23:12:38  <antimatroid> bah, now i have to wait 10 minutes to upload my collector bot :(
2011-05-20T23:12:41  <antimatroid> :p

2011-05-20T23:20:09  <amstan> antimatroid: why is tehre so many games with no food?
2011-05-20T23:20:15  <antimatroid> i don't know?
2011-05-20T23:20:18  <amstan> and why do the games just end?
2011-05-20T23:20:52  <antimatroid> crash?
2011-05-20T23:21:30  <antimatroid> the games might be a lot slower in a minute :P
2011-05-20T23:21:40  <antimatroid> i'll get rid of it after a couple of games
2011-05-20T23:22:09  <amstan> oh man
2011-05-20T23:22:11  <antimatroid> it shouldn't be mega slow when there's no food/lots of ants at least
2011-05-20T23:22:13  <amstan> the game that's playing right now

2011-05-20T23:25:50  <amstan> antimatroid: what happened there?
2011-05-20T23:26:01  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-05-20T23:26:09  <antimatroid> i need to get the current visualiser, hang on
2011-05-20T23:26:51  <amstan> antimatroid: it's one of those foodless games
2011-05-20T23:27:15  <antimatroid> i get an error?
2011-05-20T23:27:40  <amstan> antimatroid: idk, it's about the engine
2011-05-20T23:27:44  <amstan> why is the engine not spawning food
2011-05-20T23:28:00  <mcstar> these ants remind me of sand stuck behind objects in heavy wind
2011-05-20T23:28:52  <amstan> it reminds me of warcraft characters not being able to pathfind around a forest
2011-05-20T23:29:08  <amstan> and just getting stuck while trying a direct path
2011-05-20T23:31:34  <amstan> contestbot: later tell janzert is this done? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/15
2011-05-20T23:31:34  <contestbot> amstan: As you wish.
2011-05-20T23:32:21  <antimatroid> there's something wrong with my bot :\
2011-05-20T23:32:29  <antimatroid> it can't past whatever the test cases are
2011-05-20T23:32:36  <amstan> antimatroid: what were the problems then?
2011-05-20T23:32:45  <antimatroid> failed test cases
2011-05-20T23:32:55  <amstan> no food, problem with unpacking(u sure of this?), failed test case when you upload
2011-05-20T23:35:51  <antimatroid> compiled successfully but failed test cases
2011-05-20T23:35:56  <antimatroid> that's the message
2011-05-20T23:36:32  <amstan> but it goes back to successful after the test case, right?
2011-05-20T23:37:35  <demerzel> antimatroid: i have the same problem haha
2011-05-20T23:37:44  <antimatroid> amstan: what do you mean?
2011-05-20T23:37:47  <antimatroid> it's just stuck like that
2011-05-20T23:37:50  <demerzel> although i think my bots logic is broken
2011-05-20T23:37:57  <demerzel> it should still be go'ing
2011-05-20T23:38:11  <demerzel> i don't wanna put more effort into it than necessry for a starter
2011-05-20T23:38:17  <amstan> antimatroid: i'm trying to figure out what to bugreport
2011-05-20T23:38:18  <demerzel> is there a starter logic idea?
2011-05-20T23:38:28  <amstan> when you upload a valid bot, what's the status messages that you get?
2011-05-20T23:39:14  <demerzel> uploaded sucessfully or something
2011-05-20T23:39:14  <demerzel> o
2011-05-20T23:39:24  <demerzel> on that note when you hit 'View More' on submissions the page blanks
2011-05-20T23:39:28  <amstan> before that, i think it shows as error or something
2011-05-20T23:40:16  <demerzel> haha Current Rank: 1
2011-05-20T23:40:18  <demerzel> woop
2011-05-20T23:40:49  <demerzel> why are all the games ending at 30 turns with no food?
2011-05-20T23:40:54  <demerzel> that seems problematic
2011-05-20T23:41:52  <amstan> yes: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/114
2011-05-20T23:43:13  <Nebri> do you guys have a listing of all games taken place so far? I'd love to see a few examples of this game run through.
2011-05-20T23:43:41  <demerzel> i would like a full replay
2011-05-20T23:43:42  <amstan> Nebri: yes, that would be nice
2011-05-20T23:43:43  <demerzel> somewhere
2011-05-20T23:43:52  <demerzel> do you have one on pastebin amstan
2011-05-20T23:44:26  <amstan> Nebri: hold on, i'll try to find you a working game
2011-05-20T23:44:29  <Nebri> the new visualizer on the website looks good :). Just found one searching through your issues listings
2011-05-20T23:44:31  <amstan> most of them have no food
2011-05-20T23:44:34  <amstan> and they starve
2011-05-20T23:44:44  <Nebri> amstan: awesome thanks :)
2011-05-20T23:45:14  <amstan> Nebri: the latest one.. will be cool
2011-05-20T23:45:31  <demerzel> latest what
2011-05-20T23:45:35  <Nebri> amstan: ah so the one I just found is a WIP?
2011-05-20T23:45:47  <amstan> Nebri: http://hypertriangle.com:13080/visualizer.php?game=2938
2011-05-20T23:46:00  <amstan> Nebri: the ones where they just end in 30 turns is a bug
2011-05-20T23:46:03  <amstan> idk why it's happening
2011-05-20T23:47:14  <antimatroid> does anyone know what these test case things are?
2011-05-20T23:47:37  <demerzel> im not 100% certain i was trying to pin it down
2011-05-20T23:47:39  <amstan> antimatroid: no
2011-05-20T23:48:26  <Nebri> what language is the engine coded in?
2011-05-20T23:48:32  <demerzel> the greatest language
2011-05-20T23:48:37  <demerzel> ever
2011-05-20T23:48:45  <Nebri> kobol? :P
2011-05-20T23:48:56  <demerzel> i'm sure it's python like everythign else
2011-05-20T23:48:59  <demerzel> i haven't actually located it
2011-05-20T23:49:11  <Nebri> kk :)
2011-05-20T23:49:31  <amstan> Nebri: mostly python
2011-05-20T23:49:56  <demerzel> where is the actual engine
2011-05-20T23:50:32  <amstan> demerzel: i'm pretty sure this would be it: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/haskell-on-natty/ants/playgame.py
2011-05-20T23:50:42  <amstan> though it includes ants
2011-05-20T23:50:50  <amstan> which is this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/haskell-on-natty/ants/ants.py
2011-05-20T23:50:54  <demerzel> yea i looked at that
2011-05-20T23:50:56  <demerzel> ahhh ok include
2011-05-20T23:51:02  <demerzel> i was gonna say playgame doesn't seem to have any logic in it

2011-05-20T23:52:51  <demerzel> do i have to hack js or is there a simple way to get the replay data
2011-05-20T23:53:33  <demerzel> surprised one of those buttons doesn't do it
