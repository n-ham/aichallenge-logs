2011-03-24T01:44:51  <Frontier> The version of Rhino that ships with the JRE, runs in interpreted mode. Parsing a replay took >20 seconds. After optimizing a subroutine it went down to 14 seconds. The separate release from Mozilla contains a JavaScript-to-Java compiler, that cannot compile to 100% clean Java because of the dynamic nature of JS, but does a fairly good job! The parsing takes only 3 seconds now. This is faster than Opera JS engine with 5 sec.
2011-03-24T01:48:32  <Frontier> So *technically* it works, but this compiler is a big blackbox that takes js files, adds a main method and compiles to a class with the same name. It also needs attributes and methods of objects defined before first use. I'm not sure yet if it is flexible enough.

2011-03-24T05:08:23  <antimatroid> i think i found a neat little solution to an issue i had with game trees
2011-03-24T05:15:14  <antimatroid> sigh: you will do
2011-03-24T05:15:28  <antimatroid> you know how in a game tree you don't link two nodes to the same child?
2011-03-24T05:15:45  <sigh> what will i do now?
2011-03-24T05:15:58  <antimatroid> do instead of janzert
2011-03-24T05:16:38  <sigh> what do you mean, don't link two nodes to the same child?
2011-03-24T05:16:46  <sigh> you mean, create a DAG?
2011-03-24T05:16:52  <antimatroid> hang on, i'll do a paint drawing
2011-03-24T05:20:03  <antimatroid> http://i.imgur.com/8X45j.png
2011-03-24T05:20:23  <antimatroid> the first is the main way to do it, but if it lead to the same "state", then you're really calculating the same stuff twice
2011-03-24T05:20:38  <antimatroid> you can still perform backward induction on the second tree somewhat like you would the first and always get the same result
2011-03-24T05:21:06  <sigh> yup, so you have a DAG instead of a tree
2011-03-24T05:21:27  <antimatroid> directed acyclic graph?
2011-03-24T05:21:34  <sigh> yes
2011-03-24T05:21:39  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-24T05:21:55  <antimatroid> you need to make sure a node doesn't preceed yours before adding the link for that
2011-03-24T05:21:56  <sigh> in games like chess you use a transposition table to detect repeated positions
2011-03-24T05:22:00  <antimatroid> otherwise it wouldn't be acyclic
2011-03-24T05:22:09  <sigh> sure
2011-03-24T05:22:28  <sigh> alpha-beta becomes a tad more complex too, but not much
2011-03-24T05:22:37  <antimatroid> although you could do such a game and it'd be like a game on a graph with terminal nodes indicating the end of the game
2011-03-24T05:23:18  <sigh> depends what the rules are on the game if there is a repeating board position

2011-03-24T05:23:56  <sigh> but what is your question?
2011-03-24T05:24:08  <antimatroid> if it's acyclic then you get a partial order from a preceeds relation on nodes
2011-03-24T05:24:12  <antimatroid> i have no question
2011-03-24T05:24:16  <antimatroid> i just thought it was neat :P
2011-03-24T05:24:27  <phirenz> lol
2011-03-24T05:24:54  <sigh> :)
2011-03-24T05:25:34  <sigh> antimatroid: just be aware that you can't apply alpha-beta naively, because you won't have the same window when coming form two different paths
2011-03-24T05:26:04  <antimatroid> sigh: i don't use alpha beta
2011-03-24T05:26:11  <antimatroid> it doesn't work for the way i do game trees in this contest
2011-03-24T05:26:23  <sigh> ok, then you don't need to worry :)
2011-03-24T05:26:31  <antimatroid> i shall play around with it anyway though
2011-03-24T05:26:40  <antimatroid> if i do a library, it'd be nice to include such functions
2011-03-24T05:27:14  <antimatroid> i could use alpha beta for my evaluation at the end of my turn actually, i should do that
2011-03-24T05:27:25  <antimatroid> ideally one would like to use it while making the tree, but that just doesn't work
2011-03-24T05:27:42  <sigh> heh

2011-03-24T05:30:56  <phirenz> well, except for hunting the wumpus
2011-03-24T05:32:50  <antimatroid> phirenz: i expect some pretty good bots in this
2011-03-24T05:32:57  <antimatroid> and a tight contest in the top 100
2011-03-24T05:33:29  <phirenz> Yeah
2011-03-24T05:33:56  <antimatroid> it's a much more penetrable game than planet wars was i think
2011-03-24T05:34:10  <phirenz> Right now I haven't decided if I should use python or c
2011-03-24T05:34:32  <antimatroid> i suspect you may want the speed boost for this one
2011-03-24T05:34:36  <antimatroid> it didn't matter so much with planet wars
2011-03-24T05:34:52  <antimatroid> but that's just my opinion, and a very biased one on that :P
2011-03-24T05:34:56  <phirenz> Yeah, I'm getting the same feeling
2011-03-24T05:35:14  <antimatroid> why not c++?
2011-03-24T05:35:27  <antimatroid> i wrote the c++ starter bot, although i need to clean it a bit

2011-03-24T05:37:01  <sigh> antimatroid: not that simple
2011-03-24T05:37:09  <antimatroid> yeah it is
2011-03-24T05:37:13  <sigh> because the search window is different
2011-03-24T05:37:26  <sigh> so you can't just use the eval that you got from a different branch
2011-03-24T05:37:50  <sigh> you have to store if you got the exact eval, or if you hit the alpha or beta cutoff
2011-03-24T05:37:53  <antimatroid> ahh yeah
2011-03-24T05:38:04  <phirenz> I like c better as a language
2011-03-24T05:38:05  <antimatroid> wait nah
2011-03-24T05:38:08  <antimatroid> it works fine
2011-03-24T05:38:12  <sigh> if you don't have the exact, then you stil need to search a bit mow
2011-03-24T05:38:13  <antimatroid> the tree below is the same tree
2011-03-24T05:38:36  <sigh> same tree, but different search window
2011-03-24T05:38:51  <antimatroid> if you mark a child to be deleted, when deleting if the number of parents goes to zero, delete that section of the tree
2011-03-24T05:39:13  <antimatroid> otherwise just remove the child link
2011-03-24T05:39:14  <sigh> ok, I don't know what deleting has got to do with it
2011-03-24T05:39:31  <antimatroid> well, you could just skip over it
2011-03-24T05:39:44  <sigh> no, you can't
2011-03-24T05:39:48  <antimatroid> in a game like tron, you wanted to recycle your tree across turns
2011-03-24T05:39:59  <sigh> just because you searched it, doesn't mean you got the exact eval out of it
2011-03-24T05:40:14  <sigh> because you might have terminated early by hitting an alpha or beta cutoff
2011-03-24T05:40:18  <antimatroid> if you have a tree that's not going to change for the decision you make
2011-03-24T05:40:26  <sigh> yes, it will
2011-03-24T05:40:30  <sigh> :P
2011-03-24T05:40:48  <antimatroid> no, you reach the end of your turn, so you stop generating and evaluate your tree
2011-03-24T05:40:53  <sigh> because if you use alpha-beta you did NOT search the entire subtree
2011-03-24T05:41:06  <antimatroid> no, but you will search it later if necessary
2011-03-24T05:41:15  <sigh> sure, but then you can't delete
2011-03-24T05:41:27  <antimatroid> you don't need to
2011-03-24T05:41:34  <antimatroid> you just don't go searching down there now
2011-03-24T05:42:16  <antimatroid> you're still avoiding searching sections of the tree that are not going to change your decision
2011-03-24T05:43:55  <sigh> the only parts of the tree you can avoid searching down are the ones where you got an exact eval out of, or the alpha-beta window was tighter than the current one (with some qualifications)
2011-03-24T05:44:33  <antimatroid> yes, but if you have a large tree, that might be lots
2011-03-24T05:45:15  <sigh> sure, but my point is that you still need to remember what the previous window was
2011-03-24T05:45:33  <sigh> techinically, only one side of the window, the side that caused the early termination
2011-03-24T05:45:59  <sigh> if you don't remember that, then you can't prune at all
2011-03-24T05:46:12  <antimatroid> i don't need to prune the tre
2011-03-24T05:46:27  <sigh> prune/skip/whatever
2011-03-24T05:46:57  <antimatroid> take that example image i gave you, but suppose player 2's second node linked to the middle node
2011-03-24T05:47:10  <sigh> ok
2011-03-24T05:47:13  <antimatroid> it might need to be bigger :\

2011-03-24T05:47:44  <antimatroid> but yeah, suppose you got to that node, and from evaluating the first (old second) child you realised 1 wouldn't move there, then you don't need to search the common path
2011-03-24T05:47:56  <antimatroid> which might not have linked to one you've already searched
2011-03-24T05:48:03  <antimatroid> so you could just move on yeah?
2011-03-24T05:49:02  <sigh> but that decision was a function of the alpha-beta window you were using
2011-03-24T05:49:25  <sigh> if you come from a different path, you will have a different window, and might come to a different decision
2011-03-24T05:49:50  <antimatroid> hmm yeah okay
2011-03-24T05:50:13  <sigh> antimatroid: here's a page describing how to update alpha-beta to deal with this: http://web.archive.org/web/20070822204120/www.seanet.com/~brucemo/topics/hashing.htm
2011-03-24T05:50:41  <sigh> as you can see, the changes are huge, but certainly not trivial
2011-03-24T05:50:48  <sigh> *changes are NOT huge
2011-03-24T05:51:19  <sigh> (scroll down to the part where there's code)
2011-03-24T05:51:41  <phirenz> So, I'm looking over the rules from the planet wars competition...
2011-03-24T05:52:06  <phirenz> And it says that the usage of multiple threads and processes is prohibited
2011-03-24T05:52:17  <sigh> yes
2011-03-24T05:52:26  <phirenz> Is that just kernel threads?
2011-03-24T05:52:42  <phirenz> or userspace threads too?
2011-03-24T05:53:44  <antimatroid> phirenz: you realise that is the old contest yes?
2011-03-24T05:53:51  <phirenz> yes
2011-03-24T05:54:01  <antimatroid> if i recall correctly, they aren't actually checking whether people are using multiple threads
2011-03-24T05:54:13  <sigh> antimatroid: this contest will likely have the same rules :P
2011-03-24T05:54:13  <antimatroid> and "green threads" (whatever they are) are allowed
2011-03-24T05:54:17  <antimatroid> i don't really know much about that stuff
2011-03-24T05:54:30  <antimatroid> sigh: yeah, was just making sure :)
2011-03-24T05:55:37  <antimatroid> although you would be up for disqualification if they realised
2011-03-24T05:55:43  <antimatroid> so one would advise against it :P
2011-03-24T05:55:54  <antimatroid> plus, it's more fun to do well fairly
2011-03-24T05:56:26  <phirenz> yes
2011-03-24T05:56:30  <sigh> yeah, userthreads should be alright
2011-03-24T05:57:02  <sigh> but either way that should be clarified in the rules
2011-03-24T05:57:16  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-24T05:57:54  <antimatroid> sigh: want to do that for me at some point?

2011-03-24T11:54:40  <McLeopold> If you had to guess what it was for planet wars, what would that guess be?
2011-03-24T11:55:04  <jmcarthur> whether ants is high-skill or low-skill might depend on the combat resolution we choose
2011-03-24T11:55:09  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-03-24T11:55:18  <McLeopold> janzert provided a list of how far up or down the rankings you were likely not to win when expected.

2011-03-24T12:00:58  <jmcarthur> i'm trying to parse this likelihood-of-superiority output. looks like the values range from 0 to 1000. i guess i'll check the bayeselo docs
2011-03-24T12:01:20  <McLeopold> trueskill wants an 80/20 value
2011-03-24T12:01:32  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure these results are exactly applicable
2011-03-24T12:01:54  <jmcarthur> this is likelihood of superiority, but for coming up with the beta value we want to have a ratio
2011-03-24T12:02:02  <jmcarthur> wins:losses
2011-03-24T12:02:05  <McLeopold> no, but if we can figure out a way to get a beta out of this, we can run initial results through beyeselo and get one for ants
2011-03-24T12:02:30  <jmcarthur> we might be able to estimate one
2011-03-24T12:02:56  <McLeopold> I was thinking we wanted to try to get the average bayeselo score different between each players high and low mark

2011-03-24T12:03:31  <McLeopold> and that would be the beta if we had trueskill ranking on whatever scale this list is on
2011-03-24T12:05:50  <jmcarthur> LOS is calculated using some given draw ratio, normally
2011-03-24T12:06:15  <McLeopold> so, for my bot, if I go up 8, the rating difference is 30, if I go down 18, the rating difference is 33
2011-03-24T12:06:30  <McLeopold> so, beta could be about 30 for this scale

2011-03-24T12:08:05  <jmcarthur> but this is still for a given draw ratio. maybe janzert used the statistics from the tournament to come up with that though?
2011-03-24T12:08:32  <McLeopold> the list shows draw percent
2011-03-24T12:08:36  <jmcarthur> if it was given a high percentage for the draw ratio then the numbers on the table would generally be lower, i think
2011-03-24T12:08:39  <jmcarthur> oh? /me checks
2011-03-24T12:09:38  <jmcarthur> i see draws % for each bot, but not overall
2011-03-24T12:09:46  <jmcarthur> i guess it could be inferred too
2011-03-24T12:10:18  <McLeopold> that
2011-03-24T12:10:35  <McLeopold> that's probably high due to being a 2 player game with some bad maps
2011-03-24T12:10:59  <McLeopold> I would think ants would be a 0 draw chance
2011-03-24T12:11:37  <jmcarthur> very small chance, at least
2011-03-24T12:12:16  <McLeopold> If I scale this list to 0-100, that makes the 30 beta scale down to 0.075
2011-03-24T12:12:21  <McLeopold> which seems a bit small
2011-03-24T12:12:46  <McLeopold> maybe we could do the scale as 0-1000
2011-03-24T12:13:27  <jmcarthur> if we make the scale too large then people might mistake it for elo points
2011-03-24T12:13:39  <McLeopold> does that matter?

2011-03-24T12:14:24  <jmcarthur> but elo has more absolute meaning than trueskill, and people in the know might try to infer information that isn't really there. i guess it's not a big deal though
2011-03-24T12:14:53  <McLeopold> absolute as in your skill value doesn't change if you keep the same ability?

2011-03-24T12:15:33  <jmcarthur> absolute as in if you are X points above another player then that means you beat that player Y% of the time (which of course is maybe an overly liberal assumption on elo's part)
2011-03-24T12:15:36  <McLeopold> I though elo and glicko high water marks depended on the number of players in the pool
2011-03-24T12:15:47  <McLeopold> oh
2011-03-24T12:15:59  <McLeopold> that's what the beta should be
2011-03-24T12:16:02  <jmcarthur> right
2011-03-24T12:16:09  <jmcarthur> it's basically fixed in elo, not in trueskill
2011-03-24T12:16:21  <McLeopold> beta is fixed, isn't it?
2011-03-24T12:16:31  <jmcarthur> i mean it's not even configurable in elo
2011-03-24T12:16:36  <jmcarthur> because the range is free
2011-03-24T12:17:01  <McLeopold> but they always saw 200 elo is a 75% chance?
2011-03-24T12:17:04  <McLeopold> say
2011-03-24T12:17:11  <jmcarthur> yeah something like that
2011-03-24T12:17:15  <amstan> ello
2011-03-24T12:17:17  <jmcarthur> whereas in trueskill it depends on the parameters
2011-03-24T12:17:39  <McLeopold> okay, yes, we have an epsilon as well
2011-03-24T12:17:51  <McLeopold> that is the draw percentage

2011-03-24T12:17:59  <jmcarthur> but like you said earlier, i think it's not a huge deal if somebody mistakes it for elo anyway
2011-03-24T12:18:06  <McLeopold> ok
2011-03-24T12:18:38  <McLeopold> so, in planet wars, the likely hood of superiority is a very small piece of the rankings
2011-03-24T12:18:54  <jmcarthur> i'm concerned, though, that if we add more precision to the scale then people might assume that it means the scores are more accurate than they actually are
2011-03-24T12:20:22  <jmcarthur> the implementation stores a higher precision anyway. i think it's fine if we just scale to 100 and round to ones
2011-03-24T12:20:32  <jmcarthur> *set the scale to
2011-03-24T12:20:44  <jmcarthur> round to ones for display, i mean
2011-03-24T12:20:50  <McLeopold> ok, I'll stick with 100
2011-03-24T12:21:10  <McLeopold> actually, the los is really small at the top and bottom of the pw rankings
2011-03-24T12:21:23  <McLeopold> beta for that would probably be much higher
2011-03-24T12:21:37  <jmcarthur> yeah, i was noticing that as well
2011-03-24T12:21:47  <jmcarthur> seems to be a downside for having a global beta
2011-03-24T12:22:20  <jmcarthur> upside is that if you know the parameters to trueskill and have a relative score difference then it's a meaningful value, though

2011-03-24T12:25:12  <amstan> how about warlight+communication for next contest?
2011-03-24T12:25:13  <McLeopold> I'm emailing him now...
2011-03-24T12:25:20  <jmcarthur> i like basing our games on existing ones, especially with support :)
2011-03-24T12:25:21  <amstan> nah.. let's keep it on the forums
2011-03-24T12:25:30  <amstan> email him with a ping
2011-03-24T12:25:50  <amstan> or.. use the mailing list!
2011-03-24T12:25:55  <amstan> that would be appropirate too
2011-03-24T12:25:55  <antimatroid> that looks cool
2011-03-24T12:26:07  <antimatroid> amstan: i'm here
2011-03-24T12:26:08  *** woudshoo <woudshoo!~user@ipleiden.intellimagic.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-03-24T12:26:18  <amstan> antimatroid: so.. how's it going?
2011-03-24T12:26:38  <antimatroid> alright... i wanted to know what the plans are for packaging?
2011-03-24T12:26:46  <antimatroid> a lot of the wiki is hard to fix up without that
2011-03-24T12:26:59  <antimatroid> like quick start guides, how to improve your bot etc.
2011-03-24T12:27:24  <amstan> antimatroid: as a contestant, you'll have to download 2 zips
2011-03-24T12:27:28  <amstan> - your starter package
2011-03-24T12:27:37  <amstan> - the tools(visualizer, playgame.py, ...)
2011-03-24T12:27:48  <antimatroid> tools will be os specific?
2011-03-24T12:28:02  <amstan> probably not, since they're in python, html and so on
2011-03-24T12:28:35  <antimatroid> we're including the shell/bat scripts for running a game?
2011-03-24T12:28:45  <antimatroid> we can just include both, just it needs to be mentioned etc.
2011-03-24T12:28:50  <amstan> i think we'll make the python part better
2011-03-24T12:28:56  <amstan> that way there's no need for bat or sh
2011-03-24T12:29:13  <antimatroid> ah okay, i'll leave the "getting a game running" stuff for the moment
2011-03-24T12:29:41  <janzert> McLeopold, jmcarthur: btw, if you're looking at the actual LoS output from bayeselo the likelihood's are given as percentages
2011-03-24T12:29:41  <antimatroid> can you put something on the wiki about not using new os processes but green ones are fine too?
2011-03-24T12:29:46  <antimatroid> i don't really know what i'm saying there
2011-03-24T12:30:02  <amstan> antimatroid: the README.md file from tools.zip should be the same as Using the Tools page on the site
2011-03-24T12:30:03  <janzert> but bayeselo never includes the decimal point (for formatting reasons I believe)
2011-03-24T12:30:31  <amstan> antimatroid: oh... right.. what page? i can do it now
2011-03-24T12:30:39  <antimatroid> specs would be best
2011-03-24T12:30:42  <jmcarthur> janzert: yeah that's the assumption i was running with. thanks
2011-03-24T12:30:46  <antimatroid> but not really sure where to put it either :P
2011-03-24T12:30:57  <amstan> antimatroid: specs is game specific, this is more about rules
2011-03-24T12:31:09  <amstan> it's a rule regarding the sandbox
2011-03-24T12:31:10  <antimatroid> janzert: did you see my conversation with sigh about doing extensive form games with a DAG?
2011-03-24T12:31:18  <janzert> also as far as draw percentage, yes I was having bayeselo calculate it from the actual game data
2011-03-24T12:31:19  <antimatroid> amstan: perhaps there needs to be a rules page?
2011-03-24T12:31:25  <amstan> there is a rules page
2011-03-24T12:31:35  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-24T12:31:36  <janzert> antimatroid: yes, I skimmed over it at least
2011-03-24T12:31:37  <amstan> idk if on the wiki or not
2011-03-24T12:31:39  <amstan> lol
2011-03-24T12:32:02  <McLeopold> janzert: any though on what beta should be for ants, with a scale of 0-100?
2011-03-24T12:32:02  <janzert> one thing, generally when doing alpha-beta the tree isn't actually built at any time
2011-03-24T12:32:10  <janzert> McLeopold: no idea
2011-03-24T12:32:20  <amstan> blizzard.com? hmm
2011-03-24T12:32:24  <McLeopold> if it were planetwars?
2011-03-24T12:32:29  <janzert> I think we'll probably have to just watch what happens
2011-03-24T12:32:29  <amstan> isn't that warcraft blizzard?
2011-03-24T12:32:49  <amstan> it is... we have someone from blizzard join the mailing list, interesting
2011-03-24T12:32:50  <McLeopold> oh come on, make a guess :P
2011-03-24T12:32:58  <janzert> not really there either, since I'd have to go back and read what beta actually meant :P
2011-03-24T12:33:03  <antimatroid> 3.1415926535
2011-03-24T12:33:15  <janzert> I remember it has something to do with the available skill range
2011-03-24T12:33:18  <janzert> I think
2011-03-24T12:33:28  <McLeopold> beta is the difference in skill that give you an 80% chance of winning
2011-03-24T12:34:19  <janzert> so it sets the equivalent of 241 elo
2011-03-24T12:35:12  <janzert> look at what 241 elo gets you in the PW rankings then remembering that the elo differences aren't linear accross the rankings though :)
2011-03-24T12:35:17  <amstan> are we using this? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Dependencies
2011-03-24T12:35:25  <amstan> or should that be in the worker install?
2011-03-24T12:36:16  <janzert> yes, the worker installs sbcl
2011-03-24T12:36:26  <amstan> so i can delete that page then
2011-03-24T12:36:40  <janzert> I would think so
2011-03-24T12:37:28  <janzert> specifically it's there at line 97 of worker_setup.py
2011-03-24T12:38:12  <janzert> McLeopold: so beta is just a scaling factor right?
2011-03-24T12:38:25  <amstan> contestbot: seen Frontier
2011-03-24T12:38:25  <contestbot> amstan: Frontier was last seen in #aichallenge 10 hours, 18 minutes, and 50 seconds ago: <Frontier> ah, my fault. it doesn't need stuff defined before use; at least not more than any other implementation.
2011-03-24T12:38:41  * janzert should really go look at the trueskill paper again
2011-03-24T12:41:21  <amstan> contestbot: later tell Frontier About your replay format: i'm pretty impressed. 2 questions: Can i get who won in that json, or the scores(for contestbot and scrapers)? What happens to replaydata when replayformat is streaming?
2011-03-24T12:41:21  <contestbot> amstan: As you wish.
2011-03-24T12:42:52  <amstan> antimatroid: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification shouldn't bot i/o be on the other page?
2011-03-24T12:44:10  <antimatroid> amstan: sigh wanted to keep the specs all on  one page
2011-03-24T12:44:33  <amstan> antimatroid: so what's happening with the other page then? is it up to date or.. ?
2011-03-24T12:45:05  <antimatroid> looks up to date to me
2011-03-24T12:45:16  <amstan> well.. shouldn't it be deleted then?
2011-03-24T12:45:26  <antimatroid> i personally think it might be a bit easier if it was broken up like that, but sigh disagreed
2011-03-24T12:45:29  <antimatroid> i dunno what others think
2011-03-24T12:45:50  <antimatroid> it's not easy to add a table of contents to the specs page
2011-03-24T12:45:56  <antimatroid> you pretty much have to do it manually
2011-03-24T12:47:41  <amstan> antimatroid: we can figure something out, i think there's a way to do it automated(outside github, on the main site)
2011-03-24T12:47:58  <antimatroid> yeah okay cool
2011-03-24T12:48:10  <antimatroid> apparently it's a requested feature for github wikis
2011-03-24T12:48:27  <antimatroid> i imagine it'll happen eventually, it'd be a pretty common want

2011-03-24T13:47:01  <Frontier> amstan: Any meta data can be added to the meta data section. McLeopold is, I think, the one who is going to add this metadata to the engine's output. "streaming" format is what the engine stores in .stream files. I don't currently support it. It would also defeat the purpose of the streaming format if it was wrapped into a JSON object first, as you need the complete object first to be able to simulate a single turn.
2011-03-24T13:48:28  <McLeopold> I don't think we need json
2011-03-24T13:49:04  <amstan> McLeopold: look at how much data we already have, why would we not use json?
2011-03-24T13:49:24  <McLeopold> we don't gain anything
2011-03-24T13:49:50  <Frontier> McLeopold: At first I disagreed with JSON, but I think this could be the future proof way to add meta data to aichallenge replays.
2011-03-24T13:49:56  <amstan> we make it easier for tools to work with it
2011-03-24T13:50:05  <janzert> McLeopold: we don't need to do all our own parsing in the visualizer?
2011-03-24T13:51:49  <McLeopold> janzert: we would still need to parse the replay data
2011-03-24T13:52:08  <McLeopold> our custom format is essentially a key/value store
2011-03-24T13:52:09  <janzert> yes, but not everything else that is being sent

2011-03-24T14:02:37  <McLeopold> Frontier: we could still wrap the streaming format in json if needed.
2011-03-24T14:03:01  <McLeopold> you would just need to be able to display a turn as soon as you received the turn info.
2011-03-24T14:04:10  <McLeopold> another reason I would ignore json is that we really don't want to make our information set so complicated that we need nested layers of info

2011-03-24T14:04:24  <Frontier> McLeopold: I don't think I'll get around to writing a streaming visualizer. I'm happy if I get the current thing into a standalone jar. And the JSON parsers in browsers process all at once.

2011-03-24T14:05:42  <McLeopold> you would essentially need to open up a web socket and get once turn at a time, then adding that data to the list a frame you currently have.
2011-03-24T14:06:09  <Frontier> McLeopold: To get the raw data you just need to "JSON.parse(json).replaydata". That's not all that complicated
2011-03-24T14:07:58  <Frontier> McLeopold: I want the browser to cache the replays and the streaming format is ~10 times bigger. I really see it's use in local runs.
2011-03-24T14:08:17  <Frontier> where you just pipe the output of the engine into a visualizer
2011-03-24T14:08:39  <McLeopold> And hopefully the tcp server as well
2011-03-24T14:09:10  <McLeopold> I wouldn't cache streaming.
2011-03-24T14:09:48  <Frontier> no, just the sotrage format. streaming formats are volatile.

2011-03-24T14:15:12  <Frontier> Streaming playback is just not my priority and I doubt I get it done. I signed up for the html canvas renderer that naturally shows completed games. (Although it sounds fun to watch games in progress ^^). The slow situation in IE and the browser security issues with offline.html made me look into running the whole JavaScript inside Java (applet or standalone). At the end I want to have a good looking reference implementation.

2011-03-24T15:45:39  <amstan> antimatroid: so you have commit  5e48653e390dc3e8778e: added in tools
2011-03-24T15:45:51  <amstan> both local and remote have that
2011-03-24T15:46:18  <amstan> then you added updated things to the remote one
2011-03-24T15:46:25  <amstan> however the local one was not aware of this
2011-03-24T15:46:50  <antimatroid> :|
2011-03-24T15:46:57  <amstan> so it let you commit just fine, but when you wanted to push... you either have to create a branch, or merge with the current master branch in remote
2011-03-24T15:47:26  <amstan> because your new commit can't really be added to the end of the history, since the current end of the history is not a descendant of what you want to push
2011-03-24T15:47:38  <antimatroid> what's the easiest/cleanest?
2011-03-24T15:47:43  <amstan> merge?
2011-03-24T15:47:50  <antimatroid> just git merge?
2011-03-24T15:47:59  <amstan> the pull already did that
2011-03-24T15:48:01  <antimatroid> (i am still learning wtf i'm doing with git :P)
2011-03-24T15:48:02  <amstan> you're supposed to merge it now
2011-03-24T15:48:20  <amstan> basically.. you need to merge the commit from remote, with the commit from your local repo
2011-03-24T15:48:38  <amstan> sometimes there's conflicts.. because git is not a human, so you have to solve it manually
2011-03-24T15:49:07  <antimatroid> ... how do i do that?
2011-03-24T15:49:23  <antimatroid> or is there a page that explains git?
2011-03-24T15:49:32  <antimatroid> there intro pages go through a couple of things then stop :\
2011-03-24T15:49:37  <antimatroid> their***
2011-03-24T15:49:41  <dwchandler> antimatroid: http://progit.org/book/ is pretty good
2011-03-24T15:50:11  <amstan> antimatroid: The error message explains it: "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result."
2011-03-24T15:50:23  <amstan> antimatroid: you fix conflicts by oppening the file and looking for <<< >>> lines
2011-03-24T15:50:43  <antimatroid> and what? deleting my new code?
2011-03-24T15:51:00  <amstan> antimatroid: that's up to you..
2011-03-24T15:51:07  <antimatroid> how else do you fix a conflict?
2011-03-24T15:51:09  <amstan> http://progit.org/book/ch3-2.html > Basic Merge Conflicts
2011-03-24T15:51:37  <amstan> it's up to you... a conflict is nothing more than 2 modifications to the same data, that git doesn't know how to make them back to one
2011-03-24T15:51:38  <dwchandler> for conflict, you can choose old, new, or fix it yourself
2011-03-24T15:52:03  <amstan> antimatroid: read that page.. it explains stuff
2011-03-24T15:52:04  <dwchandler> fixing it yourself onlys *sounds* hard
2011-03-24T15:52:19  <amstan> antimatroid: open the file, then put it on pastebin
2011-03-24T15:52:32  <amstan> i can guide you through if you're that scared... but like.. it's pretty obvious
2011-03-24T15:53:10  <dwchandler> amstan: as someone who was once afraid of this... it's only obvious once you've done it once
2011-03-24T15:53:40  <dwchandler> then, of course, it's easy
2011-03-24T15:54:13  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/WnfPfn94
2011-03-24T15:54:44  <amstan> dwchandler: i went through this too
2011-03-24T15:54:53  <amstan> antimatroid: ok, let's start from the begining
2011-03-24T15:55:09  <amstan> antimatroid: you probably edited this code from 2 comps at once, correct?
2011-03-24T15:55:29  <antimatroid> no
2011-03-24T15:55:35  <antimatroid> it's all been done on this machine
2011-03-24T15:56:04  <amstan> i'm confused.. how did you get a merge then? did you go back to a previous version or something?
2011-03-24T15:56:31  <antimatroid> oh crap, maybe
2011-03-24T15:56:47  <amstan> antimatroid: did you do something like git reset HEAD^1?
2011-03-24T15:56:52  <antimatroid> i did, but i thought it was from after my previous commit
2011-03-24T15:57:16  <amstan> antimatroid: ok.. that's the problem then
2011-03-24T15:57:35  <amstan> you sent that version to github already, so it's there
2011-03-24T15:57:37  <amstan> let me think..
2011-03-24T15:57:47  <antimatroid> :)
2011-03-24T15:57:58  <antimatroid> i try my best to get your retarded situations :P

2011-03-24T16:01:50  <amstan> anyway, in your repo, do this: git reset --hard(cleans your folder of the merge stuff)
2011-03-24T16:02:05  <amstan> git pull :master(deletes the remote branch), git push master(uploads it back again)
2011-03-24T16:02:11  <amstan> wait..
2011-03-24T16:02:15  <amstan> you need origin in there
2011-03-24T16:02:23  <amstan> git pull origin :master and so on
2011-03-24T16:03:44  <antimatroid> ergh, things might be even more messed up :P
2011-03-24T16:04:10  <antimatroid> i'm thinking i should delete the repo and make a new one, this is just turning into a ball of mess
2011-03-24T16:05:03  <antimatroid> i'll see if i can fix it from ^^ first
2011-03-24T16:05:36  <amstan> antimatroid: no need, that should fix it
2011-03-24T16:05:56  <antimatroid> nah, i did more stuff locally that's given it another branch or something :P
2011-03-24T16:06:50  <amstan> git branch pls
2011-03-24T16:07:31  <antimatroid> whatever i've done it just uploaded stuff
2011-03-24T16:08:35  <antimatroid> what's branch? master?
2011-03-24T16:08:57  <amstan> ok... i'm going blind here, i need "git branch", "git log", "git status" from you
2011-03-24T16:09:49  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/bwD0iBuv
2011-03-24T16:10:05  <antimatroid> it committed with those extra lines, but i assume i can now delete those, commit and it'll be fixed?
2011-03-24T16:11:42  <amstan> oh.. ok
2011-03-24T16:12:10  <amstan> git reset 33549eb24759e20382b32e9b4ee809921283c7c4
2011-03-24T16:12:17  <amstan> that'll clean your log
2011-03-24T16:12:25  <amstan> make your last commit to be 33549eb24759e20382b32e9b4ee809921283c7c4
2011-03-24T16:13:45  <amstan> then push :master, then push master

2011-03-24T16:18:59  <antimatroid> a similar thing happens if i add origin :\
2011-03-24T16:20:20  <amstan> antimatroid: paste me the output of git remote
2011-03-24T16:20:32  <amstan> and yes.. origin is required
2011-03-24T16:21:34  <antimatroid> git remote is just origin

2011-03-24T16:21:57  <amstan> so.. git push origin :master should work
2011-03-24T16:22:31  <antimatroid> oh wait, do i want to pull?
2011-03-24T16:23:03  <amstan> no
2011-03-24T16:23:14  <amstan> pulling would bring those changes you don't want

2011-03-24T16:32:44  <antimatroid> amstan: can i just fork to a new one? otherwise i can just delete the whole thing and make a new repo
2011-03-24T16:32:54  <antimatroid> it's probably less effort and leaves everything clean

2011-03-24T18:16:34  <McLeopold> It could be.
2011-03-24T18:17:02  <McLeopold> it runs off of apache, I think
2011-03-24T18:17:03  <Anders____> I just wonder if is OK to have it running, or if it is a pain
2011-03-24T18:17:33  <Anders____> I guess the user support is the biggest pain
2011-03-24T18:17:35  <McLeopold> I can keep it up.  Let me know when you hit critical mass and I'll see if I can get you a setup.

2011-03-24T20:06:06  <sigh> Ants kills the player if there are any invalid moves
2011-03-24T20:06:22  <sigh> the engine processes it if there are any valid moves

2011-03-24T20:07:10  <McLeopold> I still think it was you, just that I did the merge and didn't notice :P
2011-03-24T20:07:24  <sigh> I haven't touched that part of the code
2011-03-24T20:07:29  <McLeopold> dang
2011-03-24T20:07:40  <sigh> I've commented and tweaked a lot of the code to make it clearer though, because other people are starting to look at it
2011-03-24T20:07:48  <McLeopold> well, for any given game, a parse error is different from an invalid order
2011-03-24T20:08:36  <sigh> ok, firstly, is the current functionality right?
2011-03-24T20:08:41  <McLeopold> for recording game replays, I separated valid lines from invalid lines for the engine to record, regardless of parse/invalid status
2011-03-24T20:08:51  <McLeopold> No
2011-03-24T20:09:01  <McLeopold> bots should not be killed for bad orders
2011-03-24T20:09:34  <sigh> is that the only change required?
2011-03-24T20:09:39  <McLeopold> Yes
2011-03-24T20:10:06  <sigh> bad orders are what? badly formatted? invalid moves?
2011-03-24T20:10:14  <McLeopold> when I hook up the tcp server, I want it to report all invalid and parse orders to the bot
2011-03-24T20:10:56  <McLeopold> bad orders are both
2011-03-24T20:11:37  <sigh> ok cool, I will fix it up later to do that, and either comment or reorg code to make that clear
2011-03-24T20:12:12  <McLeopold> I did keep do_orders separate from do_moves, to keep a clear separation from the "interface" and the ants game specific stuff
2011-03-24T20:12:44  <McLeopold> and I kept parse_orders separate from do_orders to keep parsing logic separate from checking for logical error in the orders
2011-03-24T20:12:44  <sigh> I'm thinking of getting rid of do_orders and moving it into resolve orders
2011-03-24T20:13:04  <sigh> yes, keeping parse_orders separate is good
2011-03-24T20:13:17  <McLeopold> yeah, at the time I "resolved" orders as they came in, but I think you cache them all now, then resolve later.
2011-03-24T20:13:49  <sigh> yeah, now do_orders and resolve_orders are heavily coupled
2011-03-24T20:14:00  <sigh> anyway, thanks for your input... gtg now, got to interview people to see if they can code or if they are noobs
2011-03-24T20:14:11  <McLeopold> ask the fizzbuzz question
2011-03-24T20:14:22  <McLeopold> actual, binary search is my favorite question
2011-03-24T20:14:45  <sigh> I'm asking a simple question involving callbacks
2011-03-24T20:15:06  <McLeopold> half the fun is making them skirm...
2011-03-24T20:15:15  <McLeopold> squirm?
2011-03-24T20:15:25  <sigh> haha... this question makes people squirm more than I imagined it would
2011-03-24T20:15:26  <McLeopold> it's a good thing I'm a programmer and not an author
2011-03-24T20:15:43  <sigh> :)

2011-03-24T21:52:33  <moongrass> ok, something completely unrelated to the contest and off the wall: if i do a google image search for a random common noun (e.g. "pencil"), and i scrape the thumbnails of the first few thousand image results, apply some generic pattern recognition algorithms on them (feature extraction etc.), do i have a chance of obtaining something of semantic relevance to said search query?
2011-03-24T21:54:41  <moongrass> how are succesful are known methods of doing stuff like this?
2011-03-24T21:55:11  <moongrass> *(how are succesful -> how succesful)
2011-03-24T21:55:52  <Frontier> moongrass: If get it working, please write the AI I'm always dreaming of. That understands how a horse or a beach ball looks like.
2011-03-24T21:56:34  <moongrass> lol ...i wont give up on those same dreams though ;)
2011-03-24T21:58:57  <moongrass> but in the case of simple objects (like a pencil), looking for basic spatial proportions should go a long way though, right?
2011-03-24T22:02:23  <moongrass> ...i imagine finding a proper "spatial grammar" onto which natural langauge grammars can be mapped, and which is designed with probabilistic learning algorithms in mimd, would be crucial...
2011-03-24T22:02:52  <moongrass> *mind...
2011-03-24T22:02:54  <Frontier> how do we learn to distinguish the horse from the dog in our childhood? I guess a first we recognize a pencil as something "about the size of a hand" which is "lengthy", "with a flat surface" and has "details on one end"
2011-03-24T22:03:07  <moongrass> right

2011-03-24T22:04:02  <moongrass> which is not that hard to express in logical/mathematical notation i think
2011-03-24T22:04:14  <Frontier> but is the human grammar the best for a computer, or do we ultimately /have/ to use it to avoid constand misunderstandings
2011-03-24T22:05:06  <moongrass> computers need to be able to parse human grammars in order to do what we want them to do, right?
2011-03-24T22:06:16  <moongrass> how else will it understand "make me a million bucks!" or "take over the world!"? :P
2011-03-24T22:06:18  <Frontier> yeah, but maybe a computer would like to learn pencil as something with 100x more yellow pixels than gray pixels or something
2011-03-24T22:06:46  <moongrass> but that's insignificant in (our human) semantic sense
2011-03-24T22:06:47  <Frontier> *would like* ... man I need to stop personalizing AI.
2011-03-24T22:08:06  <moongrass> using the internet, software agents should be able to filter out what properties of image or other media we humans consider important and which not
2011-03-24T22:08:16  <Frontier> moongrass: The 'pattern recognition' may be a black box, optimized for speed. All the human observer needs from the machine is to recognize the pencil *somehow*.
2011-03-24T22:09:05  <moongrass> yes, but humans are the "jury", when it comes to deciding which blob is a pencil and which isn't
2011-03-24T22:09:53  <moongrass> therefore software agents need to be able to approximate human semantic models, no?

2011-03-24T22:10:30  <moongrass> i suppose, yes
2011-03-24T22:12:09  <Frontier> It may be fun to try modularize the human brain and extract the basics of semantic in speech, pattern recognition, etc without touching motivations, introspection etc.
2011-03-24T22:12:54  <moongrass> it's essential i believe ...but probably only for basic vocabulary
2011-03-24T22:13:52  <moongrass> the rest of our vocab could be deduced recursively from "primitive semantics", perhaps
2011-03-24T22:14:56  <Frontier> like a dictionary, yes. but somehow i feel that we learn differently. it is not definition by definition, but more sort of a refinement and differentiation process
2011-03-24T22:15:23  <moongrass> i'm think about something WordNet-like, but on an entirely probabilistic basis open to unsupervised learning
2011-03-24T22:15:42  <Frontier> never heard of that
2011-03-24T22:16:30  <moongrass> WordNet is like a hierarchical net of english vocabulary
2011-03-24T22:16:47  <moongrass> a tree, basically
2011-03-24T22:19:01  <Frontier> a tree is not sufficient to store "transport", "flying", "duck", "car" and "airplane" :)
2011-03-24T22:20:16  <moongrass> have a look yourself then how they are classified: http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn :)
2011-03-24T22:20:21  <Frontier> when I think "wing" will I think of the duck or of the plane? it depends on the current context of thoughts in my task or short term menory
2011-03-24T22:21:08  <moongrass> which is why a dictionary will have multiple entries for some words
2011-03-24T22:21:13  <moongrass> aka: homonyms
2011-03-24T22:21:27  * antimatroid sucks enough at good english already
2011-03-24T22:21:39  <antimatroid> let alone trying the reverse engineer how i do it
2011-03-24T22:22:26  <moongrass> when you have multiple options, you assign probabilities to each option that are altered depending on context
2011-03-24T22:22:54  <moongrass> it's complex, but mostly readily solveable with known algo
2011-03-24T22:22:57  <antimatroid> i have my own problem
2011-03-24T22:23:30  <antimatroid> i need a concise name for a function that iteratively removes pure strategies that are strictly/weakly dominated by a pure/mixed strategy
2011-03-24T22:23:48  <antimatroid> there will possibly be 4 functions per game with the /s
2011-03-24T22:24:01  <antimatroid> per type of game*
2011-03-24T22:25:33  <antimatroid> nevermind got one
2011-03-24T22:25:56  <antimatroid> [P/M]IE[S/W]DS
2011-03-24T22:26:15  <Frontier> So I know your problems now. thx. I have just solved my problem: Rhino can compile and execute single JavaScript files one at a time and I can trigger the process from within my own Java class.
2011-03-24T22:35:47  <sigh> antimatroid: is [P/M]IE[S/W]DS supposed to be a function name?
2011-03-24T22:36:15  <sigh> :P
2011-03-24T22:37:25  <moongrass> ...i was too scared to ask :P
2011-03-24T22:38:15  <sigh> no, he's giving a pattern for 4 functions, but I wouldn't put it past him to want to name a function [P/M]IE[S/W]DS
2011-03-24T22:39:03  <moongrass> and he started off with "i need a concise name for"...
2011-03-24T22:40:03  <sigh> well, PIESDS is pretty concise, although completely opaque
2011-03-24T22:40:31  <moongrass> hence my fear :P

2011-03-24T22:52:11  <antimatroid> it's like "pure iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies"
2011-03-24T22:52:56  <antimatroid> although i may not do the weak versions, they don't really do much for you (it can eliminate nash equilibria and is not independent of the order in which you remove strategies)
2011-03-24T22:55:00  <antimatroid> i have PSNE, MSNE etc. for pure/mixed strategy nash equilibria
2011-03-24T22:55:51  <sigh> why do they have to be four letter names?

2011-03-24T23:49:42  <sigh> simple examples of features are corners and edges, but feature detection can get pretty sophisicated
2011-03-24T23:50:09  <moongrass> hm, right
2011-03-24T23:50:54  <sigh> in short, you match your unknown sample to the best match in your training sample in the "feature space"
2011-03-24T23:51:50  <sigh> if you want to experiment with computer vision try OpenCV: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
2011-03-24T23:52:21  <moongrass> cool, thanks
2011-03-24T23:52:54  <moongrass> maybe i just need to experiment more
2011-03-24T23:53:06  <moongrass> ...to see what the features really boil down to
2011-03-24T23:53:42  <sigh> start by learning how to detect edges and corners
2011-03-24T23:54:07  <moongrass> will do :)
2011-03-24T23:54:58  <sigh> without getting more into detail, features don't get much more complex than that, it's just figuring out which ones are representative that becomes complex
2011-03-24T23:55:36  <sigh> oh look, a quick google brought up this: http://blog.damiles.com/?p=93 - Basic OCR in OpenCV
2011-03-24T23:56:05  <moongrass> i was thinking along the lines of how to express how different kinds of features combine to make more complicated shapes/patterns
2011-03-24T23:57:15  <moongrass> nice links, thx
2011-03-24T23:57:22  <sigh> hmmm... in that example he talks about feature extraction, but doesn't actually do it
2011-03-24T23:58:17  <sigh> anyway, opencv has a whole module dedicated to feature detection, so have a look at that: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/imgproc_feature_detection.html
2011-03-24T23:58:33  <sigh> it's open source so you can see the implementation too
2011-03-24T23:59:28  <moongrass> definitely will, i guess the python version is as complete as the others?
