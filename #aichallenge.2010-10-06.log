2010-10-06T00:38:24  <sigh> wow... dmj is back to 2nd and it's still his bot from weeks ago
2010-10-06T00:38:59  <sigh> either the rankings are really unstable, or the exact players that you are playing against matters A LOT
2010-10-06T00:40:47  <amstan> sigh: can you find a game where dmj beat david?

2010-10-06T00:41:17  <Janzert> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5508876
2010-10-06T00:42:02  <amstan> you have your answer then..
2010-10-06T00:47:33  <Janzert> the other thing is that even though that bot has been up for a long time and is approaching 600 games, as of the ratings.txt that was posted earlier only 114 of them were able to count for the current scoring because of resubmissions of other bots
2010-10-06T00:47:58  <Janzert> so its elo confidence interval can't get all that tight

2010-10-06T05:28:52  <sigh> Meatkat: not that I know of. Why?
2010-10-06T05:31:03  <Meatkat> sigh: I'm not exactly sure but it seems like my bot is taking forever to 'level-up', maybe it's just the luck of the draw but I've usually started in the 500s and this time I got paired with some guy at 2600 and have had to work my way up from there. And at less than one game an hour that takes forever
2010-10-06T05:32:35  <sigh> seems like that was the just an unlucky choice for first opponent
2010-10-06T05:32:49  <Meatkat>  aka QQ
2010-10-06T05:33:50  <sigh> after the first game the ranking system is supposed to match you up with people close to your level more often.
2010-10-06T05:34:38  <sigh> if my first game was against rank 2600, I would probably resubmit :P probably faster... haha
2010-10-06T05:34:58  <Meatkat> I've noticed that, it would be nice if the system matched you up against someone near your old rank first instead of someone completely random
2010-10-06T05:35:19  <sigh> agree, I think that is on the todo list for the admins
2010-10-06T05:35:24  <Meatkat> Yeah I'm thinking about resubmitting, I think it'll be another 12 hours before I get anywhere at this rate.
2010-10-06T05:36:09  <Meatkat> I came in on them discussing how to post the range of ELO ratings, do you know if they are planning to add that to our profiles?
2010-10-06T05:38:11  <sigh> range? like the confidence interval for a given user?
2010-10-06T05:40:30  <Meatkat> Yeah
2010-10-06T05:40:39  <Meatkat> Something like 3200 (+128/-260)
2010-10-06T05:40:50  <sigh> no idea
2010-10-06T05:40:55  <sigh> @url issues
2010-10-06T05:40:55  <contestbot> sigh: issues = http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/list
2010-10-06T05:41:03  <Meatkat> That would be really helpful to have on your profile so that you know when your bot has about leveled out
2010-10-06T05:41:31  <sigh> that is the issues tracker, might find what you are looking for in there
2010-10-06T05:44:11  <Meatkat> Wow, they have a lot on their plates!
2010-10-06T05:44:52  <sigh> yup
2010-10-06T05:46:25  <Meatkat> How is your bot coming along? You used to be in the top10, right?
2010-10-06T05:47:05  <sigh> yeah, I was in the top 10 during the previous week... currently doing a big refactor/rewrite
2010-10-06T05:47:17  <sigh> mostly to facilitate exploring more advanced ideas
2010-10-06T05:47:38  <sigh> the current bot that is up is just a mess of heuristics :P
2010-10-06T05:48:15  <Meatkat> same here...
2010-10-06T05:48:21  <sigh> :)
2010-10-06T05:48:29  <Meatkat> but mine is a bit messier than yours I would imagine
2010-10-06T05:48:31  <sigh> where was your bot ranked before you resubmitted?
2010-10-06T05:48:57  <Meatkat> I've usually come in on the tail end of the first 100
2010-10-06T05:49:11  <Meatkat> but I don't really keep them in long enough to really settle
2010-10-06T05:49:29  <sigh> fair enough
2010-10-06T05:49:50  <Meatkat> Once I get heuristics down where I want them I'm probably going to something more tree-like
2010-10-06T05:49:54  <sigh> keeping them there can be helpful though... get some games to see what your bots strength and weaknesses are
2010-10-06T05:50:11  <sigh> Meatkat: same, that's what I want to start looking at
2010-10-06T05:50:57  <Meatkat> I image that's what most of the top dogs are running at the moment, though it would be interesting to know
2010-10-06T05:51:23  <sigh> nah, everyone is still mostly heuristics atm, I think
2010-10-06T05:51:48  <sigh> more advanced search is easy enough to talk about but implementing it effectivly is another matter
2010-10-06T05:52:50  <Meatkat> Definately, just thinking about trying to implement it with my current mess is giving me ulcers =p
2010-10-06T05:53:14  <sigh> a few things I've noticed from hanging out in the channel:
2010-10-06T05:53:20  <sigh> - Everyone is having the same problems
2010-10-06T05:53:34  <sigh> - People think the bots above them are much more sophisticated than they actually are
2010-10-06T05:54:15  <sigh> - There are some key ideas that are obvious or commonly talked about, the better bots just implement them more effectivly
2010-10-06T05:57:33  <Meatkat> Good to know, thanks

2010-10-06T07:17:03  <sigh> dmj111: I'm doing well... I'm trying to convince myself that rewriting my bot is worth it :D
2010-10-06T07:17:06  <sigh> how are you?
2010-10-06T07:17:49  <dmj111> ok.  I spent three days or more rewritting mine... and now I am trying to convince myself to erase the new one.  its baaad.
2010-10-06T07:18:08  <sigh> ahhh... that's what I'm afraid of :(
2010-10-06T07:18:28  <sigh> what did you try? or is that secret?
2010-10-06T07:19:04  <dmj111> my brain is almost too worn out to remember, but....
2010-10-06T07:19:53  <dmj111> basically, I was trying to make sure I keep enough stuff around at each planet, accounting for the fact that they can defend each other.
2010-10-06T07:20:09  <sigh> ah yes... that is difficult!

2010-10-06T07:20:52  <dmj111> It gave me some entertaining results, and beats my current version 50% of the time.  But it makes really weird decissions.
2010-10-06T07:21:03  <dmj111> Glad I am not the only one who thinks it is difficult!
2010-10-06T07:21:06  <sigh> :)
2010-10-06T07:21:32  <sigh> I've tried modelling it as a graph and applying various closeness measures... but I couldn't get it to give me nice results
2010-10-06T07:22:59  <sigh> *more accuratly: centrality measures
2010-10-06T07:23:21  <sigh> dmj111: at least your current bot is still very competitive at the top!
2010-10-06T07:23:42  <dmj111> yeah... I am content, if possibly misled by that.
2010-10-06T07:23:52  <sigh> :)
2010-10-06T07:24:12  <dmj111> I declared that bot an evolutionary dead end a week ago... but I laid in bed last night trying to think of how to beat ragebot with it :)
2010-10-06T07:24:40  <dmj111>  -- for everyone watching... I have no special first move logic.... I am hoping my heuristics figure it out on their own.
2010-10-06T07:25:18  <sigh> ah ok, I wasn't sure if you had done that intentionally to be more aggressive
2010-10-06T07:25:45  <sigh> which I think is a valid tactic, no one is going to act like ragebot around your level :P
2010-10-06T07:26:59  <dmj111> ha.  I wish it was intentional...  It just works ok on many maps.  I am pretty sure it is one of my two critical errors though.  The other being too cautious to take neutrals.
2010-10-06T07:27:53  <sigh> my bot loves neutrals... it often grabs them in dubious situations
2010-10-06T07:27:54  <dmj111> The 'RageBot' error occurs in other situations later in the game.
2010-10-06T07:28:12  <sigh> fair enough
2010-10-06T07:28:46  <dmj111> Yeah, any fix I have done for the neutral thing just goes way too far in the other direction.  I was hoping this new bot would only take stuff that it realized it could defend.  In fact, it does that ok.  It just does other stuff way wrong.

2010-10-06T07:29:01  <dmj111> There are only a few games there... maybe I will put it back online for fun.
2010-10-06T07:30:21  <sigh> ah yeah, that bot loves neutrals :)
2010-10-06T07:30:43  <sigh> the hardest part for me is creating an evaluation function that can effectively compare neutrals to enemy planets
2010-10-06T07:31:26  <dmj111> Ok, here is possibly my biggest secret....
2010-10-06T07:31:38  <dmj111> in the current bot, I don't compare enemy to neutrals.
2010-10-06T07:31:48  <dmj111> I alternately attack one and then the other.
2010-10-06T07:32:05  <sigh> yeah, that's an interesting strategy
2010-10-06T07:32:09  <dmj111> ok maybe not the biggest secret.
2010-10-06T07:32:40  <dmj111> I couldn't figure out how to compare them, so I gave up.
2010-10-06T07:33:05  <sigh> I score all planets that I want to attack, and just start attacking the best scores
2010-10-06T07:33:50  <sigh> If my planet will be owned by the enemy in the future, I count sending reinforcements as an attack as well
2010-10-06T07:34:06  <dmj111> Yep, sounds similar.
2010-10-06T07:34:19  <sigh> so all three of those situations are handled by just scoring and sorting :)
2010-10-06T07:34:39  <dmj111> That is what my new bot was supposed to do, but my scoring is all wonked up.
2010-10-06T07:35:56  <sigh> my scoring is essentially the same since day 1... I'm suprised that it's worked so well, but other than trivial changes I haven't been able to make it much better

2010-10-06T07:37:55  <sigh> I mean it is so *obvious* that we can do so much better
2010-10-06T07:38:21  <dmj111> I agree.
2010-10-06T07:38:31  <dmj111> i put the new bot back on the tcp server.  Let it live a little before I put it out of its misery.  That, and the games can be entertaining, but I think it is optimized to beat my official bot.
2010-10-06T07:39:05  <dmj111> Some of the games are a real beat-down too.  Maybe I will post a couple on Naktibalda's pastebin.

2010-10-06T07:40:05  <sigh> oooooh...  nice
2010-10-06T07:40:29  <sigh> what is the idea? store interesting games?
2010-10-06T07:44:09  <dmj111> my take was just to share interesting games.  It seems that there is no list of all of the games, so it is only good as long as you have the link
2010-10-06T07:44:23  <dmj111> Which is still extremely useful.
2010-10-06T07:44:36  <dmj111> _still_ is probably not the right word there.
2010-10-06T07:45:53  <sigh> cool... useful for tcp games which don't stay up very long
2010-10-06T07:48:19  <dmj111> http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt/94 the first easy example I can find where the new bot trounces the old bot.
2010-10-06T07:49:01  <sigh> yeah, very nice
2010-10-06T07:49:12  <sigh> is dmg1.8 the bot on the main contest?
2010-10-06T07:49:46  <dmj111> yeah.
2010-10-06T07:50:00  <dmj111> http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt/95 and here, the new bot pretends its ragebot.
2010-10-06T07:50:36  <sigh> that's not ragebot, it waited a turn :D
2010-10-06T07:51:11  <dmj111> true :)
2010-10-06T07:51:19  <sigh> but it seems you are having the same problem that I'm facing... you are creating a bot that is good against your previous version by exploiting their weaknesses
2010-10-06T07:51:32  <sigh> but not necessarily better overall
2010-10-06T07:52:07  <sigh> well, the problem most people are facing, I suppose
2010-10-06T07:53:18  <dmj111> I am happy, since these went about 50/50 against each other, I can have a new bot play both of them.  That may be delusional, but beating two different bots should be better than beating one.
2010-10-06T07:53:33  <dmj111> Of course, that assumes I have _any_ new ideas to try.

Also, I am starting to think it does better on the maps that the attack forms front  to back instead of around the perimeter.
2010-10-06T08:13:15  <dmj111> Maybe I could build a meta-bot that chooses which bot to use based on the map.  bwahahaha... I am sure that would fail in other spectacular ways.

2010-10-06T09:01:12  <bartwe> that it should be possible to have weights for a neural network to curve fit that function

2010-10-06T09:04:23  <antimatroid1> i still think i'll end up with some kind of approximate good move tree with minimax and some attempt at guessing characteristics of the opponent bot maybe
2010-10-06T09:04:58  <antimatroid1> then some testing to try and optimise parameters, and some classy way of picking optimal moves once a chosen feasible move has been selected

2010-10-06T09:05:26  <bartwe> i think i should look for solutions using dynamic programming

2010-10-06T09:06:19  <bartwe> antimatroid1: maybe work with some log power of units instead of precise unit counts ?
2010-10-06T09:07:33  <antimatroid1> maybe, i think one could possibly just reduce the number of fleets on cares to consider

2010-10-06T09:07:56  <antimatroid1> especially once you have like 10 planets and a few thousand ships
2010-10-06T09:08:49  <antimatroid1> i think linear programming could possible be good

2010-10-06T09:40:02  <Florian95> You can open a serv if you want

2010-10-06T09:41:42  <cfaftw> problem with the TCP server is the other people have to be "online"
2010-10-06T09:41:55  <Florian95> no pb :)
2010-10-06T09:42:22  <cfaftw> the official server is great because it plays all the bots automatically, even with people afk or with their computers off
2010-10-06T09:44:53  <Florian95> 30 users simultany on TCP :)
2010-10-06T09:44:56  <cfaftw> also... where are servers 1 - 12?
2010-10-06T09:44:57  <Florian95> Is enough
2010-10-06T09:45:15  <Florian95> and, on TCP there are hard bots, it better for training
2010-10-06T09:46:31  <cfaftw> the only hard bots on there are dmj1.8 and CCCF-mof3-asbp8-caf12

2010-10-06T09:48:56  <cfaftw> rebelxt, i was just asking about it
2010-10-06T09:49:09  <cfaftw> Florian95 gave me this link, http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-10-06T09:49:19  <cfaftw> you can see that there are only two servers, and one is crawling
2010-10-06T09:50:12  <cfaftw> rebelxt_, does somebody on freenode already have rebelxt?
2010-10-06T09:50:22  <rebelxt_> doh server #0 is too slow
2010-10-06T09:50:44  <cfaftw> i just want to know where servers 1 through 12 went ;)
2010-10-06T09:50:55  <cfaftw> (assuming they ever existed)\
2010-10-06T09:51:18  <rebelxt_> cfaftw, i'm logged on from work computer as rebelxt. this one is home laptop ;)
2010-10-06T09:51:26  <cfaftw> gotcha
2010-10-06T09:52:50  <rebelxt_> there used to be more servers for sure.. i recall seeing 40+ games per minute on the stats page
2010-10-06T09:53:46  <cfaftw> i resubmitted last night around 9 (i think) and my new bot just now played its 6th game
2010-10-06T09:53:51  <cfaftw> 9est
2010-10-06T09:55:29  <rebelxt_> i re-submitted at 10pm est last night - 4 games only
2010-10-06T09:55:43  <cfaftw> on another note... my bot does things that make me think "I don't remember programming it to do that..."
2010-10-06T09:56:09  <rebelxt_> lol
2010-10-06T09:56:24  <drodil>  :D
2010-10-06T09:57:09  <cfaftw> sometimes i feel like it thinks for itself... "i know you made me to do this thing, but i have a better idea!"
2010-10-06T09:57:51  <rebelxt_> after submitting my last bot, i found a cool bug which was fixed weeks before - it really likes to capture 0-growth planets, such as 119 planet in the middle of map1. lol
2010-10-06T09:58:00  <cfaftw> hahaha
2010-10-06T09:58:14  <cfaftw> shhhh... don't blow your strategy
2010-10-06T09:58:27  <drodil> 0 growth planets ftw :>
2010-10-06T09:58:39  <rabidus> :o
2010-10-06T09:58:43  <rebelxt_> yeah! center planet is the most important one, so whatever it takes!
2010-10-06T09:58:48  <delt0r> 0 growth planets that cost 119 ships for the win
2010-10-06T09:58:53  <drodil> :)
2010-10-06T09:59:26  <cfaftw> all the "smart" bots that do look aheads would never expect your bot to make such a move!

2010-10-06T10:00:14  <rabidus> they probably ignore that planet first place, so its safe planet to group your ships and attack

2010-10-06T10:07:11  <rebelxt_> funny i re-write a big chunk of the algorithm last night. 100% sure it's going to dominate my previous bot (by design!). and then it fails the tests miserably ;-)
2010-10-06T10:07:28  <cfaftw> Meatkat, or "return", or whatever else you need to do to make the script terminate
2010-10-06T10:07:46  <cfaftw> rebelxt_, yeah it happens... i've done the same
2010-10-06T10:08:13  <rebelxt_> Meatkat, did you try running a java bot against tcp server? just to rule out connection issue
2010-10-06T10:09:54  <rebelxt_> cfaftw: hehe glad i'm not alone. "highly sophisticated" algorithm loses to a simple heuristic approach ;-)

2010-10-06T10:41:00  <cfaftw> Meatkat, put "try:  ... except EOFError, e:  break"  around the raw_input() call in your bot
2010-10-06T10:41:15  <rebelxt_> Meatkat: what cfaftw said. also try running a java sample bot against TCP server first - to rule out connection or TCP client issue
2010-10-06T10:41:42  <cfaftw> raw_input() raises EOFError when EOF is encountered... so your bot still works with the TCP client, it just doesn't exit nicely :)
2010-10-06T10:42:42  <rebelxt_> cfaftw: are you using python too?
2010-10-06T10:42:49  <cfaftw> rebelxt_, yes

2010-10-06T11:14:28  <thearchangel> anyone?
2010-10-06T11:14:43  <cfaftw> other people have complained... not sure if it's working right now
2010-10-06T11:14:48  <cfaftw> it worked last night when i  submitted
2010-10-06T11:14:53  <thearchangel> ohk
2010-10-06T11:14:59  <thearchangel> mine's not working
2010-10-06T11:15:07  <jmcarthur> god
2010-10-06T11:15:11  <jmcarthur> how can it be so hard?
2010-10-06T11:15:18  <thearchangel> what?
2010-10-06T11:15:31  <jmcarthur> the reason it's not working is because they are keeping too many old bots around
2010-10-06T11:15:37  <jmcarthur> old versions and stuff
2010-10-06T11:15:40  <thearchangel> oh
2010-10-06T11:15:43  <jmcarthur> all they have to do is not keep them
2010-10-06T11:15:49  <thearchangel> dint kno that
2010-10-06T11:15:57  <rabidus> i think they know what they are doing
2010-10-06T11:16:18  <jmcarthur> there's a patch in the queue to fix it, but it's nt merged in yet
2010-10-06T11:16:40  <jmcarthur> in the meantime, jeff made a script to delete old submissions, but it only deletes a certain amount of bots per time
2010-10-06T11:16:41  <cfaftw> well currently when you resubmit, your ranking is reset and  your games list is cleared
2010-10-06T11:16:45  <jmcarthur> it's obviously not keeping up
2010-10-06T11:16:53  <jmcarthur> why that limit was put there in the first place is beyond me
2010-10-06T11:16:57  <cfaftw> so there's no real reason to keep any old submission around
2010-10-06T11:17:02  <jmcarthur> right
2010-10-06T11:17:11  *** fawek <fawek!~faw@chello089079023212.chello.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-06T11:17:30  <jmcarthur> the patch in the queue just moves old bots to a nested directory structures
2010-10-06T11:17:34  <jmcarthur> *structure
2010-10-06T11:17:39  <jmcarthur> so that filesystem limit isn't hit
2010-10-06T11:18:05  <jmcarthur> i think the main reason jeff wants to keep the old ones around is "just in case"
2010-10-06T11:18:13  <cfaftw> sure
2010-10-06T11:18:28  <cfaftw> i'm more curious about the server slowdown
2010-10-06T11:18:43  <jmcarthur> it's going slow?
2010-10-06T11:18:56  <cfaftw> bots are getting about 1 game every 3 hours or so
2010-10-06T11:19:02  <cfaftw> 2-3 hours
2010-10-06T11:20:56  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: looks like we lost some servers http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-10-06T11:21:05  <cfaftw> yeah i saw the stat page
2010-10-06T11:21:23  <cfaftw> but, it was the first time i'd seen it, so i don't know how many there were originally
2010-10-06T11:21:46  <jmcarthur> some of them were just for testing, but i think there were four or five at once point
2010-10-06T11:21:56  <jmcarthur> either way, we did have a huge game rate at one point
2010-10-06T11:23:34  <cfaftw> yeah we did... back in the golden days
2010-10-06T11:23:49  <cfaftw> bots were getting like 5-6 games per hour
2010-10-06T11:23:50  <cfaftw> amazing
2010-10-06T11:24:01  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: this wasn't long ago http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=837&p=5345#p5345
2010-10-06T11:24:13  <jmcarthur> 5 days i guess
2010-10-06T11:24:29  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, maybe they didn't pay their bills :(

2010-10-06T11:29:40  <cfaftw> Shane, i hope you're ready to devote all of your free time to this addiction

2010-10-06T11:30:13  <cfaftw> yeah... now that you've started the bot :)
2010-10-06T11:30:43  <ShaneHudson> before I start properly.. is there any disadvantages to using any language for this particular case?

2010-10-06T11:30:57  <ShaneHudson> I see most are java and python, anything wrong with using c# for it?
2010-10-06T11:30:58  <cfaftw> Shane, as a general rule, no
2010-10-06T11:31:07  <cfaftw> use whatever you are comfortable with
2010-10-06T11:31:14  <ShaneHudson> Ah good
2010-10-06T11:31:28  <ShaneHudson> I shall use C# then, my Java is fine, but my computer is set up for C# at the moment lol
2010-10-06T11:31:50  <cfaftw> if you plane on doing some algorithm that is insanely expensive computationally, then you might want to use C++ or some equivilantly fast language
2010-10-06T11:32:00  <krokokrusa> there are some minor issues with C# version on the server
2010-10-06T11:32:01  <cfaftw> but... i use python and have no problem keeping way under the 1s rule
2010-10-06T11:32:07  <krokokrusa> like versions incompatibility
2010-10-06T11:32:12  <optimum> anyone know when submissions will be back up?
2010-10-06T11:32:25  <ShaneHudson> I know no algorithms, I suppose I have a disadvantage in that field lol

2010-10-06T11:41:35  <Meatkat> (that's in West Africa)
2010-10-06T11:41:39  <ShaneHudson> riiight I go to install and it says its already installed, thats strange
2010-10-06T11:41:41  <cfaftw> oh :\
2010-10-06T11:41:43  <Meatkat> its* my connection
2010-10-06T11:42:23  <ShaneHudson> How do you fight the bots online? I have only done it locally so far (or do you need a bot uploaded?)
2010-10-06T11:42:49  <cfaftw> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=424
2010-10-06T11:42:58  <cfaftw> there's a TCP server you can use to spar with other bots more quickly
2010-10-06T11:43:01  <cfaftw> and keep debugging info
2010-10-06T11:43:06  <Meatkat> I'm looking into implementing that psyco thing now, maybe that will help though I haven't had problems timing out locally ever, it would be nice to be down to 10ms like you though
2010-10-06T11:43:15  <ShaneHudson> ok, stupid me.. following a java tutorial would explain why I am trying to compile java when I am doing c#! Oh deary me lol
2010-10-06T11:43:16  <cfaftw> or you can submit your bot to the official server, but it's playing games very slowly right now
2010-10-06T11:43:44  <ShaneHudson> ah ok thanks
2010-10-06T11:44:20  <cfaftw> Meatkat, how long do your turns take right now?
2010-10-06T11:44:49  <Meatkat> I'm not sure, how would I find out?
2010-10-06T11:45:47  <cfaftw> i just use time.time()
2010-10-06T11:46:11  <cfaftw> save the time at the beginning of my turn, then log the time diff in a debug message at the end of my turn
2010-10-06T11:46:14  <Meatkat> and just calculate it in-turn?
2010-10-06T11:46:36  <Meatkat> right-o, give me a sec

2010-10-06T12:21:40  <ShaneHudson> I mean to compile it etc. for java it goes to .jar, what does c# go to? exe or project? there is little documentation
2010-10-06T12:21:58  <cfaftw> ShaneHudson, why are you using C# if you don't know how to use it?
2010-10-06T12:22:49  <cfaftw> it sounds like you know Java; you should probably use the Java starter kit
2010-10-06T12:22:52  <ShaneHudson> I do lol, I have made loads of things in it.. I just have never used it with the engine etc
2010-10-06T12:23:19  <ShaneHudson> Ye I shall do java instead, more documentation for a start lol
2010-10-06T12:23:58  <cfaftw> and as a general rule, language specific questions should be directed to the appropriate channel
2010-10-06T12:25:01  <ShaneHudson> oh? I didn't realise there were other channels, sorry!
2010-10-06T12:25:16  <Error323> o_O
2010-10-06T12:26:36  <cfaftw> haha, it's ok... FreeNode is a large IRC server with a channel for just about any programming language or compsci topic
2010-10-06T12:27:19  <krokokrusa> yeah I imagine everybody at c# channel helping like crazy after "why can I not figure out how to get a c# bot working lol" question :)
2010-10-06T12:28:32  <cfaftw> haha, good point
2010-10-06T12:28:37  <ShaneHudson> Oh general c#, thought you meant there were language specific channels for ai-contest.com
2010-10-06T12:29:08  <ShaneHudson> Which is what confused me, as I had read nothing about it haha

2010-10-06T12:52:36  <cfaftw> hopefully it will prevent you from timing out on the TCP server
2010-10-06T12:53:04  <Meatkat> One hopes, mais je panse mon connection est toujours la merde
2010-10-06T12:53:06  <rabidus> umm... if your previous avg time was 100ms, then your drop was 200%
2010-10-06T12:53:46  <Meatkat> 100ms to 50ms... ?
2010-10-06T12:53:49  <cfaftw> rabidus, he meant dropped TO 50%, i think
2010-10-06T12:53:54  <rabidus> yeah, 2 times faster, 200%
2010-10-06T12:54:11  <rabidus> but if you say like TO 50%, then thats true :)
2010-10-06T12:54:24  <rabidus> nvrmnd, everybody understood
2010-10-06T12:54:33  <krokokrusa> la merde - I understood that! :)
2010-10-06T12:54:43  <cfaftw> i feel like using percentages causes so much confusion
2010-10-06T12:54:43  <Meatkat> My speed-up was 200% yes...
2010-10-06T12:54:58  <Meatkat> or... ? whatever

2010-10-06T12:57:58  <ShaneHudson> Hmm according to the simple strategy guide, planet size matters? How come the size matters? Surely it depends how many fleets are on each planet
2010-10-06T12:58:01  <Meatkat> So I resubmitted my bot and got paired up with a 2600, I think at this rate I'll reach my old rank sometime this weekend
2010-10-06T12:58:36  <Meatkat> ShaneHudson: The size of the planet in the visualizer matters because it tells you the planets regen rate - the bigger the planet the faster the regen rate
2010-10-06T12:59:02  <Error323> you can submit to the server Meatkat ? I still get php errors
2010-10-06T12:59:10  <Meatkat> but from the in game perspective planets don't have sizes, just positions, populations, and regen rates
2010-10-06T12:59:37  <Meatkat> Nope, I submitted mine about 6 or so hours ago, I've got 4 games in! Score

2010-10-06T13:02:08  <Meatkat> Work on your neutral selection algorithms then

2010-10-06T13:03:13  <Meatkat> Hmm... well first you want to see if you CAN take a neutral planet, as in your have more troops in teh area
2010-10-06T13:03:34  <Error323> lol
2010-10-06T13:03:52  <Meatkat> then you have to figure out if you want to take it, considering where you would be pulling the resources from and if the enemy could snipe, etc...
2010-10-06T13:04:57  <Meatkat> Then ... and profit!

2010-10-06T13:15:41  <Meatkat> McLeopold Yeah, cfaftw just told me about installing psyco and that dropped my times from about 100ms to 50ms, I also changed the code to handle the EOFError, you were the one that posted that on the forums weren't you?

2010-10-06T13:22:44  <cfaftw> eesh
2010-10-06T13:22:55  <Janzert> so you still have them if they are ever needed. sounded like j3camero didn't like the idea of deleting them
2010-10-06T13:23:26  <Meatkat> ShaneHudson Fun.... :(  That sucks
2010-10-06T13:23:26  <Janzert> it could easily be changed to delete them of course
2010-10-06T13:23:55  <amstan> we have a delete script already..
2010-10-06T13:23:57  <Janzert> I'm not sure how the current one works, but it will also never delete a submission that is still in use
2010-10-06T13:24:01  <cfaftw> janzert, amstan, any word on when more servers will be back up?

2010-10-06T13:24:58  <amstan> if we move them we'll have the same problem in the destination..
2010-10-06T13:24:59  <Janzert> cfaftw: I think danielvf has to deal with that
2010-10-06T13:25:01  <amstan> exactly the same problem
2010-10-06T13:25:13  <Janzert> it moves them to a different directory each time it is run
2010-10-06T13:25:24  <Janzert> basically old_submissions/date-time/
2010-10-06T13:27:52  <Janzert> one problem it does have is once there are around 10000 active participants it will allow the active submissions directory to start hitting the limit again because it keeps the 3 latest submissions for each participant in the submissions directory

2010-10-06T13:28:08  <amstan> the problem is with this supid delete script..
2010-10-06T13:28:49  <amstan> it deletes the old ones
2010-10-06T13:28:58  <amstan> except.. it doesn't mark them deleted in any way
2010-10-06T13:29:07  <amstan> so next time you run it, it deletes the same ones

2010-10-06T13:32:09  <Janzert> the other reason I liked moving them instead of deleting is that if it somehow did mess up and move the wrong submissions they can always just be moved back
2010-10-06T13:32:26  <amstan> Janzert: idk about the performance of your script
2010-10-06T13:32:33  <amstan> there's over 40000 rows in that table
2010-10-06T13:32:38  <amstan> not a good idea to do a select without a limit

2010-10-06T13:35:12  <Janzert> I've pulled from tables with over a million lines without a problem before on sqlite and postgres
2010-10-06T13:35:24  <Janzert> million rows that is

2010-10-06T13:40:14  <amstan> but then we need schema changes
2010-10-06T13:40:17  <amstan> this is so fucked up
2010-10-06T13:40:24  <Janzert> right
2010-10-06T13:40:25  <amstan> lol
2010-10-06T13:41:06  <amstan> oh man.. i wish we could just redesign
2010-10-06T13:42:47  <Error323> are the maps in the starterpackages equal to those on the server?
2010-10-06T13:43:16  <Zannick> amstan: um
2010-10-06T13:43:24  <Zannick> the script can just test to see if the files exist
2010-10-06T13:43:39  <Zannick> rather than simply try to rm them
2010-10-06T13:44:04  <Zannick> why would you need a column?
2010-10-06T13:44:41  <Janzert> the added column was just so the script can skip pulling the submission from the database at all
2010-10-06T13:44:50  <Zannick> ah
2010-10-06T13:45:36  <Janzert> something like select * from submissions where submissions.old = 0;
2010-10-06T13:45:40  <Janzert> or whatever

2010-10-06T14:00:38  <Meatkat> Remember the good old days when you could have an Elo of 3200 and be #1? I was very dissapointed when I hit 3200 and was barely on the first page!

2010-10-06T14:33:58  <cfaftw> agreed
2010-10-06T14:34:04  <hexsprite> yeah my expeience has been that the likely problem when faced with either hardware or your code... is your code ;)

2010-10-06T15:24:50  <Migi32> oh ok so it's supposed to keep rising
2010-10-06T15:25:10  <McLeopold> Migi32: I wouldn't worry about it.  We don't need to rank today's bots with bots in 50 years or anything.
2010-10-06T15:25:51  <McLeopold> Migi32: it might shrink too.  Watch the tcp server ratings.  The top spot will rise and fall depending on the total number of bots remembered.

2010-10-06T15:29:34  <ShaneHudson> Are there any plans to be able to submit multiple bots?
2010-10-06T15:30:29  <amstan> ShaneHudson: why?
2010-10-06T15:30:32  <Migi32> I hope not
2010-10-06T15:30:54  <Zannick> you can submit as many bots as you like on your account, only one will run
2010-10-06T15:31:07  <Zannick> you can't have multiple accounts participating
2010-10-06T15:31:41  <amstan> we will ban them if there's multiple active accounts
2010-10-06T15:32:05  <amstan> if you want to test your bots, either do them offline, or use the tcp server
2010-10-06T15:33:42  <cfaftw> i wish more people used the TCP server
2010-10-06T15:33:53  <amstan> why?
2010-10-06T15:35:12  <ShaneHudson> @amstan: Well I was just thinking it would be good to be able to submit ones that work different ways, but I suppose it is not important. Another question though, will the server etc still work after the challenge ends?
2010-10-06T15:35:13  <contestbot> ShaneHudson: User error -- Replace user.
2010-10-06T15:35:40  <amstan> ShaneHudson: ideally just work on one
2010-10-06T15:35:42  <ShaneHudson> Pardon? "ShaneHudson: User error -- Replace user" whats that mean lol
2010-10-06T15:35:50  <ShaneHudson> Ok thats fine
2010-10-06T15:36:04  <amstan> if we were to allow multiple entries, people could code bots that loose to some people intentionally
2010-10-06T15:36:07  <amstan> to boost their rank

2010-10-06T15:39:45  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-06T15:39:48  <cfaftw> good
2010-10-06T15:40:43  <cfaftw> McLeopold, just so you know, you were my inspiration
2010-10-06T15:40:49  <cfaftw> starting out i studied many of your games
2010-10-06T15:40:52  <Migi32> McLeopold, with wormbot?
2010-10-06T15:41:20  <McLeopold> I feel so good now.
2010-10-06T15:41:38  <McLeopold> Okay, WormBot and MoldBot are running.
2010-10-06T15:41:48  <cfaftw> ew
2010-10-06T15:41:49  <McLeopold> The real bot will be there this afternoon
2010-10-06T15:41:53  <Migi32> there's a MoldBot? I got to see :D
2010-10-06T15:41:59  <McLeopold> Oh, it's bad
2010-10-06T15:42:08  <McLeopold> First attempt at positional play
2010-10-06T15:42:16  <cfaftw> WormBot, MoldBot, DirtBot, Poop Bot
2010-10-06T15:42:43  <McLeopold> Well, mold because it's suppose to spread like spores...
2010-10-06T15:43:08  <McLeopold> Version 2 will be frog
2010-10-06T15:43:47  <McLeopold> My inspiration was deepblue, but now where is he?
2010-10-06T15:44:27  <cfaftw> yeah he dropped off the map
2010-10-06T15:45:16  <Migi32> yeah McLeopold your MoldBot sucks bad
2010-10-06T15:45:23  <Migi32> what was the idea?

2010-10-06T15:46:23  <McLeopold> ask cfaftw, it's his idea
2010-10-06T15:46:40  <cfaftw> :P
2010-10-06T15:47:05  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=342734
2010-10-06T15:47:16  <McLeopold> Here is a win.  You can see the idea I was going for.
2010-10-06T15:47:38  <McLeopold> It's an attempt to value planets on more than just growth rate.
2010-10-06T15:47:58  <cfaftw> you definitely have to value planets on more than growth rate in this contest
2010-10-06T15:48:25  <McLeopold> Actually, not too much...
2010-10-06T15:48:30  <McLeopold> Yet...
2010-10-06T15:48:52  <ShaneHudson> Do many bots currently work by distance?
2010-10-06T15:49:04  <McLeopold> The best ones do.
2010-10-06T15:49:12  <cfaftw> distance and growth rate
2010-10-06T15:49:22  <McLeopold> Obviously a close planet is faster than one across the map.
2010-10-06T15:49:47  <ShaneHudson> Precisely, yes I kept seeing my fleets go across the maps.. so next time I am working on it I shall change that
2010-10-06T15:50:02  <ShaneHudson> But for now I have a website due in
2010-10-06T15:50:15  <cfaftw> another thing to consider, there's a higher risk when sending your ships further to hit a planet
2010-10-06T15:51:06  <Migi32> btw cfaftw, what does cfa stand for?
2010-10-06T15:51:12  <ShaneHudson> That the planet would have more fleets there by the time you got there? And less time to renew
2010-10-06T15:51:22  <cfaftw> cfaftw == chick-fil-a, for the win
2010-10-06T15:51:24  <McLeopold> cfaftw: thus my relay system on my official bot
2010-10-06T15:51:25  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-10-06T15:51:30  <jmcarthur> now i want chick-fil-a
2010-10-06T15:51:49  <cfaftw> i always want chick-fil-a
2010-10-06T15:51:56  <ShaneHudson> One good thing about sending fleets a long way is that if they are your last fleets, it gives you a last chance
2010-10-06T15:52:07  <cfaftw> shanehudson, not really
2010-10-06T15:52:10  <McLeopold> ShaneHudson, it really doesn't
2010-10-06T15:52:18  <ShaneHudson> so perhaps having "if fleets are low, send to furthest away that has low population"
2010-10-06T15:52:21  <ShaneHudson> no?
2010-10-06T15:52:25  <cfaftw> nah
2010-10-06T15:52:25  <ShaneHudson> Ah ok, I am new to this :P
2010-10-06T15:52:34  <cfaftw> enemy can easily reinforce that planet your ships are drifting toward
2010-10-06T15:52:35  <jmcarthur> opponent has *plenty* of time to attack the planet you are headed toward
2010-10-06T15:52:41  <McLeopold> Every planet that fleet flies across can respond.
2010-10-06T15:53:02  <cfaftw> my bot keeps losing against that CCCF bot
2010-10-06T15:53:04  <cfaftw> so fail
2010-10-06T15:53:04  <ShaneHudson> Can you make bots that sensor where the opponents fleets are?
2010-10-06T15:53:30  <ShaneHudson> *in terms of ones that are moving
2010-10-06T15:53:32  <cfaftw> shanehudson, you can do anything you want :)
2010-10-06T15:53:44  <Error323> the game is fully observable
2010-10-06T15:53:46  <Error323> so yes
2010-10-06T15:54:03  <ShaneHudson> Haha that would involve changing the actual game files rather than just the bot... but certinally something to think about!
2010-10-06T15:54:15  <Migi32> ShaneHudson, use fleet.DestinationPlanet() and fleet.TurnsRemaining()

2010-10-06T15:57:57  <Migi32> I'ma make a VortexBot which only sends ships clockwise :P
2010-10-06T15:58:04  <a1k0n> wut
2010-10-06T15:58:06  <EfTwelve> is there a known bug that causes you to lose on the first turn because you have no starting planet?
2010-10-06T15:58:07  <Migi32> oh wait there's already a guy named vortex
2010-10-06T15:58:33  <McLeopold> cfaftw: you built faster, but allowed him to pass you up.
2010-10-06T15:58:33  <Migi32> should make for some really cool base-trades
2010-10-06T15:58:36  <jmcarthur> Migi32: vortexbot. that's awesome
2010-10-06T15:58:52  <McLeopold> you can't just sit there.  push your advantage or grow bigger
2010-10-06T15:59:01  <cfaftw> mcleopold, yeah i'm aware that my bot plays rather conservatively
2010-10-06T15:59:25  <jmcarthur> EfTwelve: the java visualizer does that if one of the players timed out on the first turn, iirc
2010-10-06T15:59:25  <a1k0n> i made an extremely advanced bot which basically spams everything randomly and dies
2010-10-06T15:59:32  <McLeopold> If I'm your inspiration, I expect 2nd place.
2010-10-06T15:59:37  <contestbot> Top 10 players: ruilov(3914), dmj111(3855), davidjliu(3820), bix0r4ever(3808), Hazard(3790), felixcoto(3766), DocBot(3712), Arekku(3696), EBraun(3677), sequoh(3661)
2010-10-06T15:59:46  <a1k0n> but it does it with a very thorough monte-carlo search
2010-10-06T15:59:47  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-06T15:59:51  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: the bot you've been working on secretly?
2010-10-06T15:59:56  <a1k0n> yeah it fucking sucks
2010-10-06T15:59:58  <jmcarthur> aw
2010-10-06T16:00:01  <McLeopold> monte-carlo?
2010-10-06T16:00:05  <jmcarthur> i hope mine doesn't do that :\
2010-10-06T16:00:17  <McLeopold> Is it worse than MoldBot?
2010-10-06T16:00:22  <a1k0n> yeah that's why you need to start running it and spend less time on the backend
2010-10-06T16:00:24  <jmcarthur> i tink mine should at least do better than monte carlo
2010-10-06T16:00:30  <jmcarthur> *think
2010-10-06T16:00:40  <EfTwelve> strange, because there is no delay, it says 'turn1' and 'player 1 wins' immediatly, in the viewer on startup there is no player 2 planet.
2010-10-06T16:01:34  <ShaneHudson> Hmm a question
2010-10-06T16:01:38  <ShaneHudson> You say that we can do anything
2010-10-06T16:01:45  <ShaneHudson> Is it possible to freeze a fleet mid flight
2010-10-06T16:01:48  <ShaneHudson> or is that cheating
2010-10-06T16:01:49  <ShaneHudson> lol
2010-10-06T16:01:58  <jmcarthur> you can see anything happening in the game, not *do* anything
2010-10-06T16:02:03  <cfaftw> i guess i was thinking of a more limited "anything"
2010-10-06T16:02:06  <ShaneHudson> Ah right
2010-10-06T16:02:09  <ShaneHudson> :p
2010-10-06T16:02:25  <amstan> you can't freeze\
2010-10-06T16:02:29  <ShaneHudson> I guessed it was not possible, but always worth asking
2010-10-06T16:03:50  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: so you are simulating many games fully to completion? i'm curious how many simulations per turn you are able to do, if so

2010-10-06T17:05:27  <agweber> [Java] So I'm trying to make a basic script where each planet attacks the nearest planet to it. But all my planets are attacking the same planet, and I can't figure out why   http://pastebin.com/6MfLdQ0x

2010-10-06T17:08:23  <Zannick> agweber: you're calculating the distance between the enemy planets, not between your planet and the enemy planet
2010-10-06T17:08:40  <Zannick> so the first planet in the list is set to target, and then it has a distance of 0 from itself...
2010-10-06T17:09:46  <agweber> Ah! Thanks, not sure how I overlooked that
2010-10-06T17:09:48  <Zannick> you probably want p.X() - q.X() etc.
2010-10-06T17:10:28  <agweber> Yep, that fixed it, thanks
2010-10-06T17:15:27  <agweber> "Failed to move file from temporary to permanent location." When trying to upload. Is this a serverside or clientside problem?
2010-10-06T17:16:34  <Zannick> this is a known problem with uploading
2010-10-06T17:16:48  <Zannick> you probably won't be able to do so for a while
2010-10-06T17:17:12  <Meatkat> serverside
2010-10-06T17:17:53  <agweber> That's fine, just wanted to make sure I didn't screw up =]
2010-10-06T17:18:09  <agweber> So what's the scale on these distances? How wide/long is a map typically?
2010-10-06T17:18:38  <Meatkat> They keep all the entries in folders in the main folder, even the old ones. When the number of folders hits the filesystem limit (32000) it doesn't allow anymore to be added. They've patched this by making a script that takes the old entries out, and periodically they move the old ones over and you can submit.
2010-10-06T17:19:50  <Meatkat> agweber: There are some maps that are relatively tightly packed, maybe 30x30 and some are much bigger, maybe 100x100

2010-10-06T17:53:03  <Janzert> right, hence needing quality playouts better than pure random so a reasonable part of the game space is explored
2010-10-06T17:53:07  <a1k0n> so maybe beam search with some kind of smart heuristic.  which might just be no better than greedily picking from your smart heuristic.
2010-10-06T17:53:25  <Error323> a1k0n: i had exactly the same thoughtprocess :P
2010-10-06T17:54:41  <a1k0n> 122 choose 22 is the number of ways to choose 22 items from 122 of them
2010-10-06T17:54:49  <a1k0n> permutations/combinations
2010-10-06T17:55:26  <Error323> ah 122 over 22 we call that

2010-10-06T22:44:21  <Frontier> Hey Lua could make for a good addition to a C++ bot during the tunig phase. One could tweak scoring funtions on the fly and repeat a certain turn without recompiling or even stopping the debugger. But it would be a lot of work to get something useful.

2010-10-06T23:30:35  <Frontier> You could simply edit a .lua file and have your bot check the modification date of the file. I have only used lua once for something very simple (parsing a formula from stdin), but it should be easy to exchange the code.
2010-10-06T23:31:53  <amstan_> meh
2010-10-06T23:32:05  <amstan_> i don't see how that's simpler than having any other code compile
2010-10-06T23:32:08  <Frontier> You could do this in Java as well if you are crazy enough. As long as the JDK is installed you can compile strings that resemble valid Java code to new classes (in memory!) and load them into the VM. Any script language can do this I guess.
2010-10-06T23:32:28  <amstan_> even C can do this, you read a file for a variable.. then remember it
2010-10-06T23:32:59  <MarcAndrePC> new bot nearly done... O_O
2010-10-06T23:33:07  <Frontier> Sure, but lua can read formulas not only values
2010-10-06T23:33:25  <jmcarthur> so can C, actually :P
2010-10-06T23:33:36  <jmcarthur> but you have to write an interpreter
2010-10-06T23:33:55  <jmcarthur> or use TCC or something :D
2010-10-06T23:34:21  <Frontier> jmcarthur: Sure, thats much simpler and faster ^^.
2010-10-06T23:34:59  <Frontier> I think most of us developers have once written a simple math parser for the standard operators + - * /
2010-10-06T23:35:36  <jmcarthur> a scheme interpreter isn't much harder
2010-10-06T23:35:53  <jmcarthur> well, a subset of scheme, of course

2010-10-06T23:36:42  <Frontier> I just want to share my idea of an ideal world. Keep the debugger running, change a script, replay the turn. See how the change turns out.
2010-10-06T23:36:59  <sigh> in my ideal world my bot writes itself
2010-10-06T23:37:26  <MarcAndrePC> me too
2010-10-06T23:37:28  <Frontier> You are one of those genetic programming guys, huh?
2010-10-06T23:37:35  <MarcAndrePC> I shout the idea and it write the code
2010-10-06T23:37:45  <sigh> preferably it would also proves some theroems like P=NP along the way
2010-10-06T23:37:53  <bhasker> sigh : better version now http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=bhaskerv20.10
2010-10-06T23:37:55  <jesusaurus> that would be impossible, it reduces to the halting problem
2010-10-06T23:38:02  <McLeopold> I'm writing my bot with a backdoor.  If you send 25 fleets to my home on turns 1 & 2, I shut down and do nothing.
2010-10-06T23:38:02  <bhasker> solved some basic problems with my previous iterations
2010-10-06T23:38:07  <Zannick> in my ideal world my bot improved itself to the point where it was bored with the contest
2010-10-06T23:38:16  <jesusaurus> so it has to write a second bot that competes in the competition
2010-10-06T23:38:17  <bhasker> still need to make it a little more conservative when acquiring neutrals

2010-10-06T23:41:03  <sigh> nope, c++
2010-10-06T23:41:11  <McLeopold> bhasker: how do you explain this?
2010-10-06T23:41:11  <bhasker> hmm here let me give you some java code
2010-10-06T23:41:12  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=349075
2010-10-06T23:41:16  <bhasker> http://jhave.org/learner/misc/knapsack/knapsack.shtml
2010-10-06T23:41:41  <bhasker> my bot is stupid in someways, i have some if then's that screw up
2010-10-06T23:41:43  <McLeopold> Surley the 60 in the center was better than the 79 at the back?
2010-10-06T23:41:47  <sigh> bhasker: yeah, the algorithm itself is easy... just haven't been bothered
2010-10-06T23:42:10  <bhasker> my profit function probably
2010-10-06T23:42:21  <bhasker> i calculate profit as # of ships it can generate 20 turns from now
2010-10-06T23:42:30  <bhasker> or so
2010-10-06T23:42:37  <bhasker> the 79 was probably a bit closer
2010-10-06T23:42:49  <bhasker> i have to adjust the cost function
2010-10-06T23:42:49  <bhasker> a bit
2010-10-06T23:42:57  <bhasker> rather the profit function
2010-10-06T23:43:03  <bhasker> but the basic algo is in place
2010-10-06T23:43:22  <bhasker> earlier it would do much worse and pick weird planets
2010-10-06T23:43:25  <sigh> McLeopold: can you reveal the logic behind scotbot?
2010-10-06T23:43:26  <bhasker> when it was purely heuristic based
2010-10-06T23:44:29  <bhasker> let me see why it picked those planets mcleopold
2010-10-06T23:45:32  <MarcAndrePC> McLeopold: when will you send a new bot to the main server?
2010-10-06T23:45:44  <McLeopold> sigh: you mean the reason I send invalid order in half my games?
2010-10-06T23:45:50  <bhasker> hah there is a bug in my code !:(
2010-10-06T23:45:52  <bhasker> need to fix that
2010-10-06T23:46:15  <sigh> McLeopold: no, just the general idea behind how scotbot works, if you willing to say
2010-10-06T23:46:45  <sigh> *if you are

2010-10-06T23:46:54  <bhasker> thanks for pointing it out McLeopold ...i shal endeavour to fix it!
2010-10-06T23:47:00  <McLeopold> grow fast.  I've got a homebrew knapsack solution
2010-10-06T23:47:29  <sigh> ah, yup... makes sense, thanks
2010-10-06T23:48:03  <sigh> it was slightly less obvious than worm or snake :P
2010-10-06T23:48:03  <McLeopold> the official version is to dumb to know it's behind on growth
2010-10-06T23:48:21  <sigh> McLeopold: same
2010-10-06T23:48:23  <McLeopold> worm is doing quite well, I'm surprised

2010-10-06T23:48:55  *** Arthur_ <Arthur_!~Arthur@203-100-216-90.callplus.net.nz> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-06T23:49:06  <McLeopold> There something to be said for throwing caution to the wind and going for the throat
2010-10-06T23:49:21  <amstan_> McLeopold: why?
2010-10-06T23:49:22  <sigh> that's should be obvious to everyone from looking at rage :)
2010-10-06T23:50:10  <McLeopold> well, sometimes the maps are such that you should just go for the opponent
2010-10-06T23:50:19  <McLeopold> worm does well on those
2010-10-06T23:50:32  <bhasker> i am also planning to do some convex hull detection
2010-10-06T23:50:36  <bhasker> to identify edge planets
2010-10-06T23:50:43  <sigh> does it ever beat your main bot, McLeopold?
2010-10-06T23:50:45  <bhasker> wondering if it will be useful
2010-10-06T23:50:52  <McLeopold> worm also doesn't get it's planets poached
2010-10-06T23:51:05  <McLeopold> cause it's always sending more if it needs it or not
2010-10-06T23:51:24  <McLeopold> sigh, it won't when i fix my bugs
2010-10-06T23:51:56  <McLeopold> right now it does on some close start maps or linear maps
2010-10-06T23:52:08  <sigh> i see
2010-10-06T23:52:59  <McLeopold> bhasker: that sound complicated
2010-10-06T23:53:44  <bhasker> well the idea is if i can identify a convex hull i would detect planets being taken over by enemy in middle of my base
2010-10-06T23:53:58  <bhasker> case in point this game http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=349165
2010-10-06T23:54:11  <bhasker> i reacted too slowly to an enemy planet in middle of my base
2010-10-06T23:54:14  <bhasker> and lost the game
2010-10-06T23:54:50  <McLeopold> so, your just looking for enemy planets within you borders?

2010-10-06T23:55:07  <bhasker> pretty much
2010-10-06T23:55:53  <McLeopold> at turn 26 you launch 55 fleets away from the battle
2010-10-06T23:55:59  <McLeopold> after his launch started
2010-10-06T23:56:18  <McLeopold> at didn't even take the neutral
2010-10-06T23:56:51  <bhasker> well i do synced launches so the 55 was probably to be followed
2010-10-06T23:56:55  <bhasker> but since he attacked
2010-10-06T23:56:59  <bhasker> it aborted the remaining attack
2010-10-06T23:57:08  <McLeopold> at turn 42, you can see a 42 and 10 fleet taking a neutral on the back line
2010-10-06T23:57:09  <bhasker> or probably didnt have enough ships to follow through
2010-10-06T23:57:41  <McLeopold> I've had so much trouble with my synced launches as well
2010-10-06T23:57:51  *** Arthur_ <Arthur_!~Arthur@203-100-216-90.callplus.net.nz> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-06T23:57:54  <bhasker> yea those are all synced launches which had to be aborted
2010-10-06T23:58:00  <bhasker> because he probably attacked and i lost the ships to complete it
2010-10-06T23:58:20  <bhasker> the 2 problems i am having are a) when not to take aneutral
2010-10-06T23:58:27  <bhasker> my bot is just too aggresive and will do stupid things
2010-10-06T23:58:41  <bhasker> and 2) first turn planet selection
2010-10-06T23:58:55  <bhasker> problem 2) is more or less solved with a couple of bugs that you pointed out with the knapsack algo
2010-10-06T23:59:11  <McLeopold> yea, that game you started out strong
2010-10-06T23:59:12  <bhasker> 1) is much harder to solve, still trying to devise a good heuristic to decide when not to take a neutral
2010-10-06T23:59:36  <bhasker> also trying to see if i should just tell my bot not to acquire neutrals too rapidly once it gets to midgame
