2011-08-24T15:35:22  <aklt> jbroman: Yeah, I agree, but It seems that most popular languages have taken their fair inspiration from lisp anyway

2011-08-24T15:36:07  <jbroman> mcstar: This only means that your brain is also weird.

2011-08-24T15:38:39  <mcstar> my point is: to what are you comparing its weirdness?

2011-08-24T15:39:42  <jbroman> mcstar: Never said it was irrational.
2011-08-24T15:39:45  <jbroman> Merely unusual.
2011-08-24T15:39:51  <mcstar> you said weird
2011-08-24T15:39:56  <mcstar> weird is somewhat irrational
2011-08-24T15:40:05  <mcstar> because its not the natural thing you think of
2011-08-24T15:40:17  <jbroman> I did not mean to imply irrational.
2011-08-24T15:40:34  <jbroman> Merely that it seems alien to a programmer of C, BASIC or Java.
2011-08-24T15:40:50  <mcstar> jbroman: i could accept your first sentence provided you change weird to unusual
2011-08-24T15:41:31  <mcstar> and yeah, now i see the inside of the parantheses

2011-08-24T15:45:41  <jbroman> So very concise but incredibly opaque.

2011-08-24T15:49:08  <mcstar> hides the inner workings?
2011-08-24T15:49:24  <mcstar> i like more transparent languages than
2011-08-24T15:49:32  <jbroman> mcstar: I meant opaque as in code, once written, is impossible to interpret at a later date.
2011-08-24T15:49:36  <jbroman> (Your code becomes a black box.)
2011-08-24T15:49:47  <mcstar> why is that good?
2011-08-24T15:49:52  <jbroman> It's not.
2011-08-24T15:49:55  <jbroman> This happens often with Perl (good Perl coders can avoid it, but most Perl coders are not good).
2011-08-24T15:50:09  <mcstar> you look at the code later, and its like a brain teaser to understand what it does
2011-08-24T15:50:39  <jbroman> Regular expressions also have this property.
2011-08-24T15:51:05  <jbroman> I call this "opacity" of a language, but that may be a definition of the term that's not widely used.
2011-08-24T15:51:17  <jbroman> I wouldn't put it past myself to make up terms.
2011-08-24T15:51:51  <mcstar> now i need to figure out what exactly did you mean by that
2011-08-24T15:52:08  <mcstar> does it mean: you are inclined to make up terms?
2011-08-24T15:52:48  <mcstar> aha, you describe yourself as someone who often makes up new terms
2011-08-24T15:52:50  <mcstar> right?
2011-08-24T15:53:01  <jbroman> Yeah.

2011-08-24T15:54:10  <jbroman> I don't mean to say things in unnecessarily confusing ways. If this becomes a problem, let me know. :)
2011-08-24T15:54:14  <mcstar> oh, yeah, what i didnt like about J is the csyntax for comments
2011-08-24T15:54:19  <mcstar> .NB comment
2011-08-24T15:54:27  <mcstar> sry
2011-08-24T15:54:31  <mcstar> NB. comment
2011-08-24T15:55:13  <mcstar> jbroman: i usually understand english, but now im tired, and  it was an unusual figure of speech
2011-08-24T15:55:44  <jbroman> It is an unusual figure of speech. And I could see how it would seem to make no sense if you tried to parse it word-by-word.
2011-08-24T15:56:13  <mcstar> yeah, you got to flow with the words, let them in, understand the whole at once
2011-08-24T15:58:26  <mcstar> i spotted an error of yours
2011-08-24T15:58:35  <mcstar> Your a Lisp coder...
2011-08-24T15:58:39  <mcstar> its Youre a...
2011-08-24T15:58:58  <mcstar> yeah, im a bugger
2011-08-24T15:59:00  <jbroman> mcstar: You're quite correct; it should have been "You're".
2011-08-24T15:59:10  <jbroman> I usually don't make that mistake too often.
2011-08-24T15:59:13  <jbroman> I hang my head in shame.
2011-08-24T15:59:20  <mcstar> no need for that
