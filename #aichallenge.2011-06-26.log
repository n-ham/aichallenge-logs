2011-06-26T01:19:38  <stocha> _flag: i'm not a ranking algorithm. I do watch games. And can spot a clear superiority.
2011-06-26T01:19:41  <_flag> Either that or it hasn't played macelon on smaller maps yet, so I'm not sure how it'll do there
2011-06-26T01:19:59  <stocha> ah smaller map. i forgot about that one.
2011-06-26T01:20:30  <stocha> but i guess there a suficiently few of them, that normal map superiority (90% win) will make out for them.
2011-06-26T01:20:36  <stocha> even if they are loosing.
2011-06-26T01:20:48  <stocha> so i guess you have first for now :p

2011-06-26T01:20:51  <_flag> One of the things macelon does wronge (IMO) is he clumps up his ants too much allowing for me to run around and capture more food until I can overwhelm him
2011-06-26T01:21:18  <stocha> _flag: yeah, i was wondering how his bot feeded so well with that.

2011-06-26T01:21:41  <stocha> it seems that escaping on open maps is good strategy
2011-06-26T01:22:16  <stocha> it would be interesting to see how tings goes on a tiny corridor map though
2011-06-26T01:22:39  <antimatroid> stocha: this was a complete fluke, but i really like this map http://ants.zeroviz.us/wPk4p/
2011-06-26T01:22:42  <_flag> We'd probably both just block off the corridors and it would come down to food spawns
2011-06-26T01:23:04  <antimatroid> i'm trying to make a faster more mazey generator
2011-06-26T01:23:19  <stocha> antimatroid: did you used the big room trick ?
2011-06-26T01:23:42  <sigh> antimatroid: there are a lot of maze algorithms out there, are you looking at those, or rolling your own?
2011-06-26T01:23:45  <antimatroid> that was using voronoi diagrams to order the squares then adding water while it was still valid
2011-06-26T01:23:49  * sigh is back in australia
2011-06-26T01:23:49  <antimatroid> a terrible way of generating maps

2011-06-26T01:24:44  <antimatroid> and i have looked at a few other maze algorithms
2011-06-26T01:24:46  <stocha> are you the google guy ? i'm a bit lost. who was the google guy
2011-06-26T01:25:06  <stocha> i have no memory for speudonyms it seems
2011-06-26T01:25:10  <antimatroid> there are lots of google guys
2011-06-26T01:25:12  <antimatroid> sigh is one of them yes
2011-06-26T01:25:16  <sigh> I don't know about *the* google guy, but I do work at google
2011-06-26T01:25:31  <stocha> but he is THE (new) google guys that can play go also.
2011-06-26T01:25:36  <antimatroid> sigh: how was mtv overall?
2011-06-26T01:25:38  <stocha> i think. if i don't mess up things a bit :p
2011-06-26T01:25:47  <antimatroid> you have the right person
2011-06-26T01:25:58  <stocha> sigh: so how is your bot doing ? :p

2011-06-26T01:26:52  <stocha> the programming language.
2011-06-26T01:27:01  <sigh> haven't used it
2011-06-26T01:28:44  <sigh> why the sudden interest in verilog?
2011-06-26T01:29:17  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Lost terminal)
2011-06-26T01:29:55  <stocha> sigh i don't know. I want to learn it. I want to understand a low level language. Seem more stable(universal) than assembler beside it.
2011-06-26T01:30:16  <stocha> although i'm clearly lacking the base :'(
2011-06-26T01:30:18  <sigh> but verilog is a hardware description language?
2011-06-26T01:30:25  <stocha> sigh: yeah.
2011-06-26T01:30:32  <stocha> a low level language if there is one :)
2011-06-26T01:30:45  <stocha> I never tryed to dig beyond assembly, for 20 years !
2011-06-26T01:31:03  <stocha> i'm a bit ashamed all of sudden. Especially when i feel that it answers so much.
2011-06-26T01:31:21  <sigh> ah ok, sure
2011-06-26T01:31:23  <stocha> hardware is inerently parallel it seems.And it has interesting primitives.
2011-06-26T01:31:31  <sigh> I used VHDL in uni a bit, but I don't remember much
2011-06-26T01:31:53  <stocha> I've always go like : Why are there so many useless stuff in assembly language atoms ?
2011-06-26T01:32:21  <stocha> it seems that hardware is indeed a lot cleaner.
2011-06-26T01:32:36  <stocha> Lastly, i do most my thinking with bit manipulation.
2011-06-26T01:32:51  <stocha> (high level language thinking that is)
2011-06-26T01:32:54  <sigh> depends, at the transistor level, hardware is very messy :P
2011-06-26T01:33:05  <stocha> yeah ? how so ?
2011-06-26T01:33:20  <stocha> you mean it's physics and chemicals etc ?
2011-06-26T01:33:41  <stocha> so the transistor would be the key to straightforward "high level" language then.
2011-06-26T01:33:44  <sigh> it's a step above physics, you are dealing with electronics
2011-06-26T01:33:52  <stocha> i know so few about electronic.
2011-06-26T01:34:09  <stocha> i don't even know where to begin. i only need whatever is usefull for verilog and such though.
2011-06-26T01:34:13  <sigh> but going from transistor to logic gates is messy (from my view)
2011-06-26T01:34:22  <stocha> but i simply have the level of a 8 years old boy. (or girl)
2011-06-26T01:35:00  <stocha> Yeah, but logic gates seems clean. Although their seems to be some electricity concept.
2011-06-26T01:35:36  <stocha> Do many is taken for granted. Because verilog is tought only to people that have high electronic background.
2011-06-26T01:35:53  <stocha> I don't even know where to look to have the base.
2011-06-26T01:36:02  <sigh> yeah, once you have logic gates then the rest is "easy" to reason about
2011-06-26T01:36:04  <stocha> if you have a suggestion ...
2011-06-26T01:36:28  <sigh> have you looked at something like this: http://mines.humanoriented.com/proposals/nand-to-tetris/
2011-06-26T01:36:32  <stocha> i think i have seen signal transmission stuff talken about.

2011-06-26T08:02:22  <carlop> see this example in one of your maze map: http://ants.zeroviz.us/dDw5p/
2011-06-26T08:02:25  <antimatroid> i don't mind having paths between regions which are 1 width wide, provided there is a work around
2011-06-26T08:02:41  <antimatroid> a 2x2 block can traverse every land square of that
2011-06-26T08:03:20  <antimatroid> carlop: yeah, you need to have a 3x3 block that can traverse the map
2011-06-26T08:03:32  <antimatroid> it was just an example map
2011-06-26T08:04:04  <carlop> yes, the problem is that i have not think of a method for guarantee non-blockable map
2011-06-26T08:04:18  <antimatroid> a 3x3 block being able to traverse all land?
2011-06-26T08:04:25  <antimatroid> why doesn't that work?
2011-06-26T08:04:29  <carlop> 3x3 block traversing work
2011-06-26T08:04:34  <carlop> but limit a lot the possible map
2011-06-26T08:05:21  <antimatroid> i want to do simple random dfs walks on a stack to generate a map
2011-06-26T08:05:42  <antimatroid> but it's hard to do it with a large block moving around in a smaller grid
2011-06-26T08:05:54  <carlop> i think that few 1-corridor or 2-corridor can be a good thing, but i can not understand how to check if the map is blockable or not
2011-06-26T08:06:24  <antimatroid> carlop: notice the "openings" in the above map which are 1 width?
2011-06-26T08:06:28  <antimatroid> those will still be possible
2011-06-26T08:06:32  <carlop> yes, that is the problem, cause i think a lot of 2x2 traversable map are non blockable, but is hard to guarantee that a map is non-blockable
2011-06-26T08:06:34  <antimatroid> so you can block off paths
2011-06-26T08:06:50  <antimatroid> but you can't block yourself into a region
2011-06-26T08:06:52  <carlop> yes, but blocking path don't seem a problem for me
2011-06-26T08:09:52  <carlop> my problem is "find afast proof that a map do not have a blockable region, without limiting too much the possible pattern"

2011-06-26T09:04:08  <smiley1983> That's correct, if you have ocamlbuild then it will calculate what it needs to compile

2011-06-26T09:10:51  <UncleVasya> I wrote a function that works very slow and I think  it isn't a correct way to do what I need.
2011-06-26T09:12:21  <UncleVasya> It gets 2 lists and adds to the 2nd list all items from 1st list except ones that already in the 2nd list.

2011-06-26T09:13:41  <UncleVasya> For example:  1 2 4 6  and  2 4 5   -->  1 2 4 5 6

2011-06-26T09:19:33  <smiley1983> replace ([head] @ lst_2) with (head :: lst_2)
2011-06-26T09:20:18  <antimatroid> smiley1983: how many types of rotational symmetry did you have? i have 5 types for 2 player maps, 3 types for 4 player maps and 1 for 8 player maps
2011-06-26T09:21:29  <smiley1983> antimatroid: make a grid of cells. They are all closed. Pick a random cell and mark it as open. Put all of its closed neighbors into the closed list. Iteratively remove an item from the closed list, connect it to a random open neighbor, and add its closed neighbors to the list
2011-06-26T09:21:49  <smiley1983> When there are no more closed cells, stop :)
2011-06-26T09:22:19  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i'll play around thanks
2011-06-26T09:22:48  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: ([head] @ lst_2) builds a new list containing one item, and then adds the items of the two lists together. head :: lst_2 just adds the item to lst_2
2011-06-26T09:22:54  <antimatroid> i also have the problem of wanting to make them while moving say a 3x3 block around in a grid, moving only 1 n/s/e/w at a time, which complicates stuff :\
2011-06-26T09:23:01  <smiley1983> antimatroid: I only used one sort of rotational symmetry

2011-06-26T13:02:23  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: I've seen another optimization which can be applied to the code you posted earlier
2011-06-26T13:03:44  <smiley1983> If lst_1 is already free of duplicates within itself, you can replace line 6 with:
2011-06-26T13:03:58  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: I found a problem in program logic.There was a possibility to deal without merging lists.
2011-06-26T13:04:16  <smiley1983> head :: merge_unique tail lst_2
2011-06-26T13:04:33  <UncleVasya> But it always interesting to learn better way, so thanks again.
2011-06-26T13:04:43  <smiley1983> Right, merging lists like this is always going to be costly, so is best avoided
2011-06-26T13:05:26  <smiley1983> no problem :) Does the "head :: merge_unique tail lst_2" make sense?
2011-06-26T13:08:01  <UncleVasya> currently line 6 is   merge_unique tail (lst_2 @ [head])  because  head must be added to the end of lst_2.
2011-06-26T13:08:48  <smiley1983> yes - but that means that when you check for duplicates in the next pass, you are checking against the newly added items as well
2011-06-26T13:09:52  <smiley1983> The way I'm suggesting, you build the list of results as you go, without the double-checking, which would have been a large reason why it was slow
2011-06-26T13:10:55  <smiley1983> since merge_unique returns a list, "head :: merge_unique ..." builds the item onto the result of the next call to merge_unique
2011-06-26T13:12:48  <UncleVasya> I think I've got it.
2011-06-26T13:13:33  <smiley1983> it's a useful structure to understand, because it appears often
2011-06-26T13:15:09  <smiley1983> oh, though I now realise that this adds the items to the beginning of the list.
2011-06-26T13:15:49  <smiley1983> If they must be added to the end, you probably have to use List.rev on lst_2 before passing it in, and then List.rev again on the result - but there's usually a way to avoid this

2011-06-26T13:28:42  <antimatroid> carlop, GreenTea: the idea is that you guys don't really need to understand all of grid.py, just be able to use the needed functions
2011-06-26T13:29:19  <antimatroid> it's messy, but i think it makes it easy to write general map generation functions for all symmetry types at once
2011-06-26T13:29:27  <carlop> yes, currently i'm working on grid.py... i found more interesting the part about generating symmetry,,,
2011-06-26T13:30:09  <carlop> but later i can look at how build random walk that seem interesting (what parameter are needed, etc)

2011-06-26T23:49:35  <antimatroid> if i have 4/8 players, then you just get all land
2011-06-26T23:49:59  <amstan> antimatroid: what?
2011-06-26T23:50:03  <amstan> why?
2011-06-26T23:50:31  <antimatroid> notice with the first map how every second square is land
2011-06-26T23:50:36  <antimatroid> plus some extra land joining them all?
2011-06-26T23:50:39  <amstan> yes
2011-06-26T23:51:00  <antimatroid> that's how the maze gets generated, when the symmetry flips back on itself or whatever, every second square becomes the other every seocnd square
2011-06-26T23:51:06  <antimatroid> making the entire row/col land
2011-06-26T23:51:43  <amstan> can't you just generate half of the map? and then do it that way with the symmetry
2011-06-26T23:53:48  <antimatroid> i have to work out how to pick out which part of the map to rotate then
2011-06-26T23:54:33  <antimatroid> amstan: http://pastebin.com/GvdeXjdb that's my grid.py file for making maps :P
