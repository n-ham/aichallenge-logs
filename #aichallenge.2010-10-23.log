2010-10-23T00:19:01  <Zannick> yep
2010-10-23T00:19:33  <janzert> ok, I'll probably get rid of it unless you need for some more changes then
2010-10-23T00:21:10  <Zannick> i doubt there's anything left to do for it
2010-10-23T00:21:38  <janzert> yeah, just thought I'd double check with you

2010-10-23T00:27:49  <janzert> anyone know a better way than trial and error to find out what the maximum arguments length sudo will allow for a command? apparently the maximum length xargs calculates is longer than sudo allows
2010-10-23T00:28:23  <Mathnerd314> janzert: can you sudo xargs?
2010-10-23T00:28:40  <foucist> janzert: if it's so long, why not encapsulate it in a script file and then sudo run that script
2010-10-23T00:29:10  <foucist> i imagine the limit is somewehre around 513 characters
2010-10-23T00:29:52  <janzert> foucist: we could but it's a command run pretty frequently by the tournament

2010-10-23T00:30:19  <janzert> hoping to avoid the overhead of a script, but maybe I'm worried for nothing
2010-10-23T00:30:37  <foucist> janzert: all the more reason to encapsulate it ? what overhead of a script?
2010-10-23T00:30:46  <foucist> janzert: you running the comman within your code?
2010-10-23T00:31:28  <janzert> yes, it is to clean up after a bot runs a game basically
2010-10-23T00:32:14  <janzert> it is doing a straight sudo -u botuser rm -rf /botdirectory/* basically
2010-10-23T00:32:41  <janzert> but if the bot has too many files sudo errors out
2010-10-23T00:33:14  <foucist> try sudo -u botuser rm -rf /botdirectory/\*
2010-10-23T00:33:44  <foucist> \* stops bash/etc from loading all the files into the args

2010-10-23T00:34:04  <foucist> but it will still behave the same
2010-10-23T00:34:13  <janzert> hmm, yeah I assume something will still do the expansion after the sudo
2010-10-23T00:34:28  <janzert> sounds like a much better fix
2010-10-23T00:35:53  <janzert> bah, nope doesn't look like anything expands the glob then
2010-10-23T00:36:26  <Mathnerd314> put an sh in? sudo -u botuser "sh rm -rf /botdirectory/\*"

2010-10-23T00:41:15  <amstan> janzert: what is that?
2010-10-23T00:41:56  <janzert> a paraphrased fix for line 112 of user_sadbox.py in the cloud branch
2010-10-23T00:42:28  <amstan> janzert: i assume this is for you: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=877&start=30
2010-10-23T00:42:32  <janzert> some bots leave enough files around that the current command has an error instead of cleaning up
2010-10-23T00:42:56  <janzert> :) thanks
2010-10-23T00:43:09  <amstan> yeah, they seem all happy
2010-10-23T00:43:11  <janzert> I'm trying to keep at least two running
2010-10-23T00:43:15  <amstan> it was all dark and gloomy for a while
2010-10-23T00:44:01  <janzert> running my own when Jeff's go down, which unfortunately is about 6 hours after they get started lately
2010-10-23T00:44:48  <amstan> janzert: so.. why do they go down?
2010-10-23T00:45:21  <janzert> instability of ubuntu 8.04 on ec2 :(
2010-10-23T00:45:50  <amstan> can't a script be done that does this?
2010-10-23T00:45:51  <janzert> unfortunately I don't think he can give me access to restart them properly without completely opening his AWS account to me
2010-10-23T00:46:14  <janzert> yes, but jeff will have to run it somewhere that he is comfortable putting his credentials
2010-10-23T00:46:32  <amstan> for i in $(cat serverlist); do ssh $i hostname; done
2010-10-23T00:47:01  <amstan> i can probably do it on hypertriangle
2010-10-23T00:47:02  <janzert> when they crash the only way to get them back is a reboot from amazon interface itself
2010-10-23T00:47:06  <amstan> he can kill me if i take them away
2010-10-23T00:47:12  <janzert> there is no ssh or anything
2010-10-23T00:47:20  <amstan> yeah, but at least you know they crashed..
2010-10-23T00:47:23  <amstan> or..
2010-10-23T00:47:25  <amstan> do we already know that?
2010-10-23T00:47:53  <janzert> well, a glance at game_stats.php shows what is up
2010-10-23T00:47:59  <amstan> i see
2010-10-23T00:48:13  <amstan> well, you have to communicate with jeff, see what can happen

2010-10-23T00:48:38  <amstan> and i'm online most of the time
2010-10-23T00:48:57  <janzert> yeah. I am hoping to create a script that will do it so it can watch my instances
2010-10-23T00:49:03  <janzert> then he could use it as well
2010-10-23T00:49:14  <amstan> yeah
2010-10-23T00:49:23  <amstan> there's a few people that want golang support
2010-10-23T00:49:31  <janzert> got a bit distracted fixing other bugs in our code
2010-10-23T00:49:32  <amstan> as far as I saw, compile anything already has it
2010-10-23T00:49:35  <rwa> man this competition is getting fierce
2010-10-23T00:49:49  <amstan> janzert: all that's left to do is actually install golang
2010-10-23T00:50:12  <janzert> install it on main server and add it to the instance setup script
2010-10-23T00:50:23  <janzert> just trying to get instances sort of stable first
2010-10-23T00:50:42  <janzert> well and actually I should probably try and sort out c# as well
2010-10-23T00:50:57  <janzert> since it's suppose to be one of our primary languages
2010-10-23T00:51:02  <amstan> yeah
2010-10-23T00:53:08  <janzert> if jeff will give you access to his AWS account so you could reboot instances that would be great
2010-10-23T00:53:27  <amstan> yeah, that might be possible
2010-10-23T00:53:46  <janzert> one of the things that I feel bad about it is that since they are still running he is still getting charged even though they're doing nothing usefull
2010-10-23T00:55:37  <amstan> i still don't get why we picked amazon clouds
2010-10-23T00:55:45  <amstan> we have perfectly good comps in so many other places
2010-10-23T00:55:53  <amstan> that really are spinning uselessly
2010-10-23T00:55:55  <amstan> and they're free
2010-10-23T00:56:32  <janzert> if we can get clean installs of ubuntu 8.04 and root access it would be easy to set them up now
2010-10-23T00:57:01  <janzert> it's not completely automatic but I've done locally
2010-10-23T00:57:29  <amstan> we just need a virtualbox image
2010-10-23T00:57:48  <amstan> and we can deploy it on as many comps as possible
2010-10-23T00:57:52  <amstan> @repo
2010-10-23T00:57:53  <contestbot> amstan: repo = http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/
2010-10-23T00:58:10  <amstan> here were my ideas: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/Decentralization
2010-10-23T00:58:58  <janzert> yeah, running just the bots remotely runs into lag issues though
2010-10-23T00:59:21  <amstan> well.. w/e, how it's done now is fine too
2010-10-23T00:59:34  <amstan> i just think it should be more modular
2010-10-23T00:59:57  <janzert> there's not really anything in the current set up tied to amazon
2010-10-23T01:00:18  <amstan> so why can't we do this on more servers?
2010-10-23T01:00:33  <amstan> i have 3 comps doing nothing

2010-10-23T01:01:26  <amstan> i just need an ubuntu image to deploy, and instructions on how to do stuff
2010-10-23T01:02:07  <janzert> ok, I'll try write up step by step instructions from a fresh 8.04 install tomorrow
2010-10-23T01:02:50  <amstan> janzert: while you do those, can you actually do them in a virtualbox vm?
2010-10-23T01:02:59  <amstan> it would be much easier to deploy
2010-10-23T01:03:44  <amstan> janzert: also.. what happens when a cloud server goes down?
2010-10-23T01:03:49  <amstan> janzert: score wise
2010-10-23T01:03:57  <amstan> do the bots loose? or is the match just ignored?
2010-10-23T01:04:01  <janzert> it won't report any game result
2010-10-23T01:04:04  <amstan> good

2010-10-23T01:04:44  <janzert> yeah, should be able to
2010-10-23T01:04:48  <amstan> great
2010-10-23T01:05:02  <amstan> so..
2010-10-23T01:05:17  <amstan> please do that, we have so many sources of comps, and we're not using them
2010-10-23T01:05:49  <janzert> something we will need soon is a way to update cloud servers rather than just set them up from scratch
2010-10-23T01:05:54  <amstan> we got donations from portland, at greghaynes' university
2010-10-23T01:06:05  <amstan> janzert: update?
2010-10-23T01:06:07  <janzert> if this takes off with many sources running them
2010-10-23T01:06:08  <amstan> what do you mean?
2010-10-23T01:06:16  <amstan> oh.. well
2010-10-23T01:06:18  <janzert> update to the latest code
2010-10-23T01:06:34  <janzert> you'll notice the code base isn't really static :)
2010-10-23T01:06:36  <amstan> those ubuntu vms, get them setup so you can ssh into them as soon as they're deployed
2010-10-23T01:06:51  <amstan> isn't that enough?
2010-10-23T01:06:58  <janzert> one other problem I noticed this morning
2010-10-23T01:07:18  <janzert> yeah, technically at least. doing manual updates over many servers will be painful
2010-10-23T01:07:44  <janzert> the main server was getting overloaded with 5 instances requesting games
2010-10-23T01:08:06  <janzert> of course once we have stable instances we can shut the games on the main server off
2010-10-23T01:08:15  <janzert> which should help a lot
2010-10-23T01:08:15  <amstan> yeah
2010-10-23T01:08:47  <amstan> janzert: tell me if you need help with anything, i can do stuff, as long as i know what's going on
2010-10-23T01:09:14  <amstan> janzert: also.. another thing.. will you support rewriting the codebase from scratch for the next contest?

2010-10-23T04:38:41  <amstan> hmm
2010-10-23T04:38:44  <amstan> so..
2010-10-23T04:39:07  <amstan> i think we're getting golang tomorrow, janzert said he'll look into it
2010-10-23T04:39:13  <amstan> same with C#
2010-10-23T04:40:22  <amstan> lavalamp_: 2010-10-23T00:49:23 @ http://contestbot.hypertriangle.com/channellogs/%23aichallenge/%23aichallenge.2010-10-23.log
2010-10-23T04:41:00  <lavalamp_> oh, awesome!
2010-10-23T04:41:02  <amstan> lavalamp_: i'm not exactly sure what andrew could do for us, he should contact Jeff about participating in administration
2010-10-23T04:42:09  <lavalamp_> amstan, I don't know if you could use money for more servers or anything... it might not hurt to ask if so. I don't know what resources he has.
2010-10-23T04:42:31  <amstan> lavalamp_: what we lack is organization, and time
2010-10-23T04:42:43  <lavalamp_> And I'm still not convinced Jeff actually exists :)
2010-10-23T04:42:57  <amstan> we have lots of problems with the design, we should of planned this much better before launching
2010-10-23T04:42:59  <amstan> and yeah..

2010-10-23T04:44:23  <lavalamp_> OK I will respond to him then. I guess if janzert needs any assitance setting golang up I can put them in touch.
2010-10-23T04:44:31  <amstan> it's me and janzert
2010-10-23T04:44:46  <amstan> it's not hard... it's just installing it
2010-10-23T04:44:53  <lavalamp_> it's so odd that they seem to have skipped out on you like that
2010-10-23T04:45:03  <amstan> for not the cloud servers are going down for no reason at all
2010-10-23T04:45:33  <amstan> i would like to help, but i really don't like the organization, how it's svn, how i can't communicate to jeff and all that
2010-10-23T04:45:52  <lavalamp_> ah
2010-10-23T04:46:08  <amstan> for this reason i don't feel like actually coding and stuff, since what i'll do will probably be useless
2010-10-23T04:46:29  <lavalamp_> Yeah I think I understand
2010-10-23T04:47:13  <amstan> like it's an awesome contest.. but..
2010-10-23T04:47:16  <amstan> it's jeff's thing
2010-10-23T04:47:25  <lavalamp_> ...and he vanished
2010-10-23T04:47:53  <amstan> we need a good talk to him
2010-10-23T04:48:14  <amstan> but yeah, it's not about cpu time, or resources, or people to help
2010-10-23T04:48:25  <lavalamp_> ok, makes sense
2010-10-23T04:49:15  <amstan> aw, come on!

2010-10-23T04:50:00  <lavalamp_> I've been to bed and up already
2010-10-23T04:50:14  <amstan> you wake up at 5am?
2010-10-23T04:50:51  <lavalamp_> earlier, I sleep only a few hours at night and take a few naps during the day.
2010-10-23T04:51:01  <amstan> lavalamp_: polyphasic?
2010-10-23T04:51:05  <amstan> lavalamp_: how is that?
2010-10-23T04:51:38  <lavalamp_> amstan, yeah, it's interesting. Not easy to maintain a napping schedule, unfortunately.
2010-10-23T04:52:05  <amstan> i'm not a schedule kinda guy, i don't think i could do it
2010-10-23T04:52:26  <amstan> also, i'm not confident that it'll work during school and work
2010-10-23T04:52:33  <lavalamp_> neither was I, but the extra time is worth a lot of inconvienience to me...
2010-10-23T04:53:02  <amstan> but most work places have this 8 hour block of working
2010-10-23T04:53:17  <amstan> and polyphasic will require you to have a nap in the middle of that somewhere
2010-10-23T04:53:18  <lavalamp_> Yeah, I take a nap instead of lunch, it works for me but not everyone could pull that off, I'm sure...
2010-10-23T04:53:30  <amstan> where do you nap?
2010-10-23T04:53:37  <lavalamp_> A supply closet :)
2010-10-23T04:54:16  <amstan> what about physical rest?
2010-10-23T04:54:30  <amstan> well, nvm, i guess this is not an issue with us computer types
2010-10-23T04:54:55  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-10-23T04:55:05  <amstan> idk, i'm just scared
2010-10-23T04:55:40  <lavalamp_> I am still not convinced the more extreme schedules are actually doable, I certainly couldn't do them.
2010-10-23T04:56:27  <lavalamp_> Or actually, my current theory is that they are doable only by those who naturally have low SWS requirements.

2010-10-23T05:33:11  <antimatroid> i'm curious as to whether anyone is correctly doing future states with future moves from both players
2010-10-23T05:33:16  <antimatroid> i have no idea how the fuck to do it
2010-10-23T05:33:36  <Error323> its impossible
2010-10-23T05:33:52  <raedwulf> antimatroid: thats the idea of minimax
2010-10-23T05:34:01  <Error323> yup
2010-10-23T05:34:08  <raedwulf> but the branching factor is massive
2010-10-23T05:34:12  <raedwulf> which causes loads of problems
2010-10-23T05:34:14  <antimatroid> yes, but i need it to do minimax :P
2010-10-23T05:34:20  <raedwulf> it makes Go look simpler
2010-10-23T05:34:42  <raedwulf> minimax on Go has been pretty much dismissed

2010-10-23T05:35:14  <raedwulf> the only way minimax could work is if you prune the search tree early enough and not lose the benefits of minimax
2010-10-23T05:35:46  <raedwulf> and its *very easy to lose* the benefits if you do prune early
2010-10-23T05:35:48  <Error323> the pruning is the problem
2010-10-23T05:35:58  <raedwulf> because you need to prune correctly
2010-10-23T05:36:00  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-10-23T05:36:08  <Error323> =]
2010-10-23T05:36:52  <raedwulf> no doubt ill try a minimax approach after this one
2010-10-23T05:36:56  <raedwulf> which im still doing ugh
2010-10-23T05:37:01  <raedwulf> wish i could code fast
2010-10-23T05:37:03  <raedwulf> faster*
2010-10-23T05:37:06  <raedwulf> i need louder music
2010-10-23T05:37:23  <raedwulf> thats better
2010-10-23T05:37:34  <Error323> mmm coding with music is distracting
2010-10-23T05:37:35  <Error323> =)
2010-10-23T05:37:39  <raedwulf> nein
2010-10-23T05:37:53  <raedwulf> helps me focus
2010-10-23T05:38:04  <antimatroid> even if you want to do coordinated attacks on minimax
2010-10-23T05:38:12  <antimatroid> it breaks unless you can do future moves in your data
2010-10-23T05:38:24  <antimatroid> is it actually not possible? or just really fucking hard
2010-10-23T05:38:37  <raedwulf> what do you mean *future moves in your data*
2010-10-23T05:38:44  <raedwulf> im not entirely sure whats the problem
2010-10-23T05:38:56  <antimatroid> say i want to send fleets from 5 planets to planet j, not all the same distance and arrive at the same time
2010-10-23T05:39:01  <antimatroid> i have to make some of those moves in the future
2010-10-23T05:39:22  <antimatroid> but then dependent on future moves that get made, that planet may not have that many ships or even be owned by the player
2010-10-23T05:39:34  <raedwulf> oh
2010-10-23T05:39:36  <antimatroid> one can try and add outgoing fleet information all over the place, but it still breaks down i think
2010-10-23T05:39:59  <raedwulf> im not going to do that, i recalculate every move
2010-10-23T05:40:04  <raedwulf> i move and *forget*
2010-10-23T05:40:08  <raedwulf> when i get a new state
2010-10-23T05:40:10  <antimatroid> yeah so do i
2010-10-23T05:40:24  <raedwulf> IMO, keeping ideas what you're going to do in the future is wrong
2010-10-23T05:40:34  <antimatroid> i don't want to keep them
2010-10-23T05:40:40  <raedwulf> this is not chess
2010-10-23T05:40:40  <antimatroid> but i want to make a tree, with players alternating turns
2010-10-23T05:40:50  <antimatroid> if i make a future turn, that can be rendered useless, it causes issues
2010-10-23T05:41:01  <antimatroid> each turn i recreate my information
2010-10-23T05:41:01  <raedwulf> yea, don't create future moves
2010-10-23T05:41:16  <antimatroid> how else do you make sure it works?
2010-10-23T05:41:43  <antimatroid> say you need to send ships to the planet, but they can't arrive any time but the same time
2010-10-23T05:42:04  <antimatroid> then you must send some in the future at a point in time
2010-10-23T05:42:08  <antimatroid> it's unavoidable
2010-10-23T05:42:20  <raedwulf> oh easy, basically you see where your other fleets are heading and see if they need help
2010-10-23T05:42:39  <raedwulf> and send them off in that turn if you exactly that distance away
2010-10-23T05:42:48  <raedwulf> you=that planet
2010-10-23T05:43:39  <antimatroid> that doesn't make any sense
2010-10-23T05:43:45  <raedwulf> it doesn't?
2010-10-23T05:44:16  <antimatroid> an example that makes sense, you want to take a neutral just after the opponent, you can't send some of the ships to arrive early, otherwise you just make it cheaper for the opponent to take the planet
2010-10-23T05:44:37  <antimatroid> but if you add those moves into the future to information, you run into the problems i mention above and it all falls to pieces
2010-10-23T05:44:37  <raedwulf> yes
2010-10-23T05:45:13  <raedwulf> well it really depends on your implementation
2010-10-23T05:45:21  <raedwulf> but one way is to store future moves

2010-10-23T05:45:37  <antimatroid> yeah, but then finding out when to delete them is just messy
2010-10-23T05:45:39  <raedwulf> and add constraints that if planet sends x ships away, do not violate future move
2010-10-23T05:45:43  <antimatroid> and i'm not sure how i'd do it even works well
2010-10-23T05:45:50  <raedwulf> if future move is violated, remove future move
2010-10-23T05:46:17  <raedwulf> i.e. if the enemy attacks your planets and you don't have enough resources for that future move
2010-10-23T05:46:33  <raedwulf> but there's better ways of doing this
2010-10-23T05:46:58  <antimatroid> have you actually implemented something like this yet?
2010-10-23T05:47:05  <antimatroid> it seemed easier to me before i tried doing it
2010-10-23T05:48:07  <lavalamp_> antimatroid: I'm solving this by considering future moves but not actually adding them to my state
2010-10-23T05:48:33  <antimatroid> i've considered that, but then how do you evaluate your final state?
2010-10-23T05:48:39  <raedwulf> antimatroid: im implementing it differently
2010-10-23T05:48:45  <raedwulf> so that situation would not crop up
2010-10-23T05:48:56  <raedwulf> i only consider what i see now, and not what i don't need to see :P
2010-10-23T05:49:16  <lavalamp_> yeah, well, my bot is terrible currently XP

2010-10-23T05:52:57  <raedwulf> well no doubt my first bot version is going to fail ^^
2010-10-23T05:55:36  <raedwulf> at least i've written lots of debugging code

2010-10-23T07:49:41  <raedwulf> oh ok, where do you hail from?

2010-10-23T07:50:39  <raedwulf> oh right ^^
2010-10-23T07:50:45  <raedwulf> << UK
2010-10-23T07:52:22  <raedwulf> the bots are weird, its like they have a massive winning streak then suddenly fail with a losing streak
2010-10-23T07:52:54  <raedwulf> well not exactly a losing *streak* but enough loses to shift the ranking again
2010-10-23T07:54:17  <raedwulf> interesting, a miscalculation?: http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=6068264
2010-10-23T07:56:08  <javagamer> I think that's how the rankings work, you'll face people worse than you until you move up and start facing people better than you
2010-10-23T07:57:18  <raedwulf> oh ok
2010-10-23T07:58:42  <javagamer> Just a guess though, I haven't read up much on how ELO works, spending all my free time trying to get something worth submitting

2010-10-23T11:24:10  <Zalma> Hi. I'm really noob on coding but how do I compile my bot done with c++? =)
2010-10-23T11:25:12  <Zalma> I'm currenly using visual studio 2010 pro...
2010-10-23T11:30:04  <lavalamp_> Zalma, look for the build command
2010-10-23T11:30:30  <lavalamp_> I'm on an older version at work so I can't say exactly where it is
2010-10-23T11:31:26  <Zalma> well I cant even debug.. even that is gray
2010-10-23T11:33:20  <lavalamp_> you may need to set up a project
2010-10-23T11:33:45  <lavalamp_> try making a new command line app and adding your files
2010-10-23T11:34:00  <lavalamp_> ...if you already did that, ignore me
2010-10-23T11:34:41  <Naktibalda> use gcc instead :)
2010-10-23T11:35:55  <Zalma> no I haven't done that..
2010-10-23T11:36:05  <Zalma> how do I actually add the files to project? =)
2010-10-23T11:37:19  <Zalma> I have used c++ last time in dos age ;)

2010-10-23T11:39:25  <raedwulf> Zalma: mingw gcc is another compiler - thats similar to the one used on the server. Of course, it might take some familiarity to set up.
2010-10-23T11:39:38  <raedwulf> have you any experience with unix?
2010-10-23T11:39:45  <Zalma> nope =)
2010-10-23T11:39:54  <raedwulf> ok
2010-10-23T11:40:12  <Zalma> I've been banging my head today for 10 hours already
2010-10-23T11:40:45  <raedwulf> technically you can use any C compiler (although the msvc c compiler doesn't support modern standards of C as well)
2010-10-23T11:40:52  <Zalma> I wish visual basic would work.. :P
2010-10-23T11:40:56  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-10-23T11:41:04  <raedwulf> you could put in a request
2010-10-23T11:41:08  <raedwulf> they have c#
2010-10-23T11:41:13  *** rebelxt <rebelxt!~apinkin@24-155-144-5.static.grandenetworks.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-10-23T11:41:21  <raedwulf> if you ask nicely, they could add visual basic .net
2010-10-23T11:41:58  <Zalma> Thou visual basic .net would be quite similar.. I'm more familiar on old visual basic (without .net) =P
2010-10-23T11:41:59  <raedwulf> note they use the mono version of .net, which is compatible with an older version of .net
2010-10-23T11:42:05  <raedwulf> oh ok
2010-10-23T11:42:24  <Zalma> atleast I did read doing C# isn't worth doing.. compiling is hard or something
2010-10-23T11:42:43  <raedwulf> yes, its because the age of the version of mono being used
2010-10-23T11:42:58  <raedwulf> if you're  using msvs.net its a bitch to get it to work with the server
2010-10-23T11:43:31  <raedwulf> a lot of people are using python and java
2010-10-23T11:43:59  <raedwulf> lua works too, but no one has written a starter package for that
2010-10-23T11:44:26  <Zalma> I'm just trying to get even some language to work
2010-10-23T11:44:28  <raedwulf> i stand corrected, http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=615
2010-10-23T11:44:49  <Zalma> got like 50x error while compiling submission today already
2010-10-23T11:44:59  <Zalma> only ones that really work were started packets..
2010-10-23T11:45:18  <Zalma> I have already tried java, C# and C++
2010-10-23T11:45:27  <Zalma> getting pretty much frustrated
2010-10-23T11:45:41  <Zalma> especially java versions work well locally
2010-10-23T11:45:49  <Zalma> and compile without errors
2010-10-23T11:46:21  <raedwulf> sorry you're using C++ (msvc 2010 support for c++ is excellent) heh
2010-10-23T11:46:31  <Zalma> and finally when I got it to compile it crashed at first turn.. (even thou it did work well at locally)
2010-10-23T11:46:48  <raedwulf> im not very familiar with java
2010-10-23T11:46:55  <raedwulf> i am quite familiar with C# though
2010-10-23T11:47:19  <raedwulf> but i prefer C... i like being close to metal :P
2010-10-23T11:47:20  <Zalma> Well it doesn't matter what I get working easiest... I
2010-10-23T11:47:24  <Zalma> I'm bad in them all
2010-10-23T11:47:25  <foucist> Zalma: can't you get someone else's java/c++ program that doesn't crash
2010-10-23T11:47:27  <foucist> and modify?
2010-10-23T11:47:51  <Zalma> well as soon as I start to modify something it doesn't work anymore in server ;)
2010-10-23T11:47:58  <raedwulf> well he's on windows and unfamiliar with C++, so it doesn't plug and play
2010-10-23T11:49:07  <Zalma> raed: ehm?
2010-10-23T11:49:51  <raedwulf> well, the start package is only useful if you can compile it on a unix environment; you can compile it on msvc 2010 as well, but you need to create the project files yourself
2010-10-23T11:49:55  <raedwulf> and a solution file
2010-10-23T11:50:20  <raedwulf> on unix, its extract, and run "make"
2010-10-23T11:50:22  <raedwulf> and it works
2010-10-23T11:50:24  <raedwulf> :P
2010-10-23T11:50:54  <Zalma> Well I do have ubuntu on my virtual box..
2010-10-23T11:51:02  <Zalma> if compiling with that is easier
2010-10-23T11:51:08  <raedwulf> in that case, yep it would
2010-10-23T11:51:19  <raedwulf> basically you can extract it on there
2010-10-23T11:51:23  <raedwulf> open a terminal
2010-10-23T11:51:32  <raedwulf> into that directory - then run "make"
2010-10-23T11:51:42  <raedwulf> it should compile to give you "MyBot"
2010-10-23T11:51:45  <raedwulf> which you can then run
2010-10-23T11:51:58  <raedwulf> well using the java tool
2010-10-23T11:54:00  <Zalma> need to learn using that virtual box first :P
2010-10-23T11:54:15  <Zalma> well atleast that I can access to my files

2010-10-23T15:32:24  <gerald512kk> hi all :)
2010-10-23T15:33:49  <janzert> askinAround: it /should/ work but there seems to be some errors around, try resubmitting and it will probably work that time
2010-10-23T15:34:55  <janzert> lavalamp_: it seems boost is already installed on the servers so it seems like the only thing stopping it from being used is that it's not getting linked in
2010-10-23T15:35:32  <lavalamp_> janzert: good luck with that, I have only ever set it up on a windows machine
2010-10-23T15:35:34  <janzert> lavalamp_: my question is what is the correct command line for linking with boost
2010-10-23T15:35:41  <janzert> ok
2010-10-23T15:35:53  <lavalamp_> yeah sorry I don't know that :(
2010-10-23T15:36:33  <lavalamp_> my guess would be you just have to get the include paths right but boost is friggin' complicated so there might be something special you need to do...
2010-10-23T15:36:58  <janzert> yeah, I was hoping it was as simple as adding -lboost or some such :)
2010-10-23T15:37:13  <a1k0n> it's probably -lboost1.36.53.2358
2010-10-23T15:37:24  <janzert> ahh, well I've got more pressing things anyway :/
2010-10-23T15:37:25  <a1k0n> depending on which of the many mutually-incompatible versions out in the wild you have installed
2010-10-23T15:37:54  <janzert> it's the ubuntu hardy libboost-dev package if someone wants to investigate

2010-10-23T15:47:08  <p4p4> janzert, i think they're generating a makefile (prbly from python) based on the files you submit, so if it's that header-only part of boost, it might work with just adding them to your zip
2010-10-23T15:47:41  <janzert> no makefile is generated in the compilation of your bots :)

2010-10-23T15:56:13  <lavalamp_> askinAround: it probably crashed. feed it some test data over stdin and see what it does

2010-10-23T15:56:56  <askinAround> but why does it crash? it's the one I downloaded from the site and I didn't modify it at all
2010-10-23T15:57:17  <janzert> hopefully soon though I can work on adding a few more languages, but I hate to promise anything right now
2010-10-23T15:57:23  <lavalamp_> askinAround, oh then I don't know. maybe it couldn't find the exe?
2010-10-23T15:57:24  <askinAround> shouldn't the site have a version that doesn't crash?
2010-10-23T15:57:40  <lavalamp_> janzert anything you can do is greatly appreciated :))
2010-10-23T15:57:52  <janzert> askinAround: if you run the bot directly does it start up
2010-10-23T15:57:59  <lavalamp_> askinAround, they don't, there's something wrong with your setup

2010-10-23T17:39:08  <jkl__> Regarding tracking future states with future moves for both players, there is simple equation based on the battle rules that tells you how many ships you must have on-planet on turn t - 1 if you want to have s free ships on turn t.
2010-10-23T17:40:58  <jkl__> s(t) = s(t-1) + g + f(t-1) + maxE(t-1)

2010-10-23T17:43:03  <jkl__> that should be - maxE(t-1) not +
2010-10-23T17:44:01  <jkl__> you use that equation to keep track of how many free and how many reserved ships you have on each planet on each future turn
2010-10-23T17:44:19  *** Zalma <Zalma!50dd5eb7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.80.221.94.183> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-10-23T17:45:00  <jkl__> So if on turn 3 you send 100 ships from planet 1, you will have 10 free and 90 reserved ships on turn 1, 10 free and 95 reserved ships on turn 2, and 0 free and 0 reserved ships on turn 3.
2010-10-23T17:47:32  <jkl__> That should be 10 free and 0 reserved on 3.
2010-10-23T17:48:10  <jkl__> The problem is what happens when you make a future plan at this stage of the analysis, and then you consider an enemy counter-move that invalidates the plan.
2010-10-23T17:49:43  <jkl__> What you have to do is separate the planning from execution.
2010-10-23T17:50:10  <jkl__> So you have your current plan, and you want to add some more moves to it.
2010-10-23T17:50:22  <jkl__> Execute the plan, and examine the resulting game state.
2010-10-23T17:51:05  <jkl__> Now look for new opportunities, taking into account ships that ended up getting reserved when your plan was executed.
2010-10-23T17:52:28  <jkl__> Now take the enemy's side, and build a response.
2010-10-23T17:53:01  <jkl__> However, when you evaluate the game result, you have to start with a fresh game state
2010-10-23T17:53:36  <jkl__> So you have to sort all the moves by turn, and execute those which actually happen first, first
2010-10-23T17:54:13  <jkl__> If a move is invalid because it assumes a game state that does not hold, it cannot be executed
2010-10-23T17:57:13  <jkl__> I have found that minimax works well for actual combat but not so well for maintaining field position
2010-10-23T17:58:56  <jkl__> In other words, it finds good short-term tactical moves but does poorly with long-term strategy

2010-10-23T18:01:39  <jkl__> It's much easier to evaluate combat
2010-10-23T18:04:14  <jkl__> So what I've tried is running minimax to find tactical moves, and then running a separate reinforcements heuristic to handle the leftover ships.

2010-10-23T20:18:23  <rwa> janzert?
2010-10-23T20:19:49  <rwa> jkl_?
2010-10-23T20:21:41  <janzert> yes?
2010-10-23T20:23:10  <rwa> the 10 minute delay - what's the purpose of that?
2010-10-23T20:23:33  <janzert> in order to stop constant resubmition
2010-10-23T20:23:47  <rwa> makes sense
2010-10-23T20:24:47  <janzert> and if the submission fails there is no delay so on a compilation error you can fix and resubmit right away
2010-10-23T20:25:33  <rwa> before it was rational to keep resubmitting until your first game was against a decent bot if you expected a high rank
2010-10-23T20:26:26  <janzert> actually even that probably wouldn't have triggered putting in the delay
2010-10-23T20:26:48  <janzert> someone was just constantly resubmitting sometimes multiple times per minute
2010-10-23T20:27:12  <antimatroid> me? :P
2010-10-23T20:27:24  <janzert> hehe, don't think so

2010-10-23T20:30:50  <janzert> I've got the build script about generalized so it should work on any bare ubuntu 8.04 install
2010-10-23T20:31:44  <janzert> but it lead to seeing another error with the worker tournament manager and I need to track that down

2010-10-23T20:36:51  <rommel> not in the stone age anymore lol
2010-10-23T20:37:22  <jkl__> I want to help with issue 189, which addresses the problem of incorrect error messages.  Can anyone explain how the error table gets populated?  I see api_record_game.php, but what uses it?
2010-10-23T20:37:36  <janzert> hmm, I thought wave was shutting down end of september. guess I got the wrong date
2010-10-23T20:37:59  <janzert> the cloud tournament_manager.py
2010-10-23T20:38:13  <janzert> found in the 2010....cloud... branch :)

2010-10-23T20:40:03  <jkl__> in the Web interface
2010-10-23T20:40:04  <janzert> yep look in the backend code in there
2010-10-23T20:40:13  <jkl__> thanks
2010-10-23T20:40:18  <janzert> that is the code running on the worker instances
2010-10-23T20:40:28  <janzert> trunk is running on the main server
2010-10-23T20:41:00  <janzert> it really should be merged back together, but that's something to do later :/

2010-10-23T20:56:32  <jkl__> OK, so you have a try/except pair around engine.play_game, but all the except code does is some logging, it sleeps (?), and then it falls through to the code that handles the game result.  Shouldn't the game result be abandoned?
2010-10-23T20:58:19  <janzert> not super familiar with that code, let me look at it and see if anything different jumps out to me
2010-10-23T20:59:12  <janzert> hmm, that does look pretty suspicious
2010-10-23T21:00:12  <jkl__> I don't think that is what is causing 189, but it may cause the tournament manager to crash
2010-10-23T21:00:30  <janzert> yeah, I was just going to say it should cause the manager to crash
2010-10-23T21:00:32  <jkl__> outcome will be None
2010-10-23T21:00:51  <janzert> actually worse than that
2010-10-23T21:00:58  <janzert> read before assignment isn't it?
2010-10-23T21:01:07  <janzert> either way crash
2010-10-23T21:01:25  <jkl__> You're probably right
2010-10-23T21:01:29  <jkl__> outcome will just be undefined
2010-10-23T21:01:37  <janzert> an explicit sys.exit would be better though
2010-10-23T21:01:52  <janzert> or probably can even just continue
2010-10-23T21:02:16  <jkl__> I'll submit a patch

2010-10-23T21:03:01  <janzert> I'll change the sleep to sys.exit unless you see something that is definitely better
2010-10-23T21:05:57  <jkl__> I don't know right now.  I'm still trying to understand what is going on.
2010-10-23T21:06:28  <rebelxt_> mega1 is just killing us on the tcp server. 94% win 469 games wow
2010-10-23T21:06:50  <janzert> ok, in all my test running I've never seen the tournament_manager crash with outcome undefined so if that code is getting triggered it's very rare
2010-10-23T21:07:27  <jkl__> why catch an error condition you can't handle?
2010-10-23T21:07:52  <jkl__> If the program is just going to fail, let it fail
2010-10-23T21:08:07  <janzert> yeah, I was just wondering that as well unless he was logging sys.stdout at the time or something and wanted the traceback
2010-10-23T21:08:24  <jkl__> But wouldn't you get that anyway?
2010-10-23T21:08:25  <janzert> but it does look almost like debugging code that got left
2010-10-23T21:08:36  <janzert> not if he was throwing away stderr
2010-10-23T21:08:58  <janzert> since many of the bots print tons of trash to stderr
2010-10-23T21:09:18  <jkl__> OK, that makes sense
2010-10-23T21:09:23  <janzert> at this point though the way it is set up both stdout and stderr are just fed to /dev/null
2010-10-23T21:10:05  <janzert> tournament_manager_runner.sh is used to run tournament_manager.py in a loop

2010-10-23T21:11:31  <janzert> but yeah I think just getting rid of the whole try except clause at this point is probably best

2010-10-23T22:20:25  <janzert> just make sure you take it over at the end of the game if it's the only one your opponent has left

2010-10-23T22:41:21  <janzert> where?
2010-10-23T22:41:38  <jkl__> line 121
2010-10-23T22:41:46  <jkl__> look at the players array
2010-10-23T22:41:49  <janzert> tournament_manager?
2010-10-23T22:41:53  <jkl__> yes
2010-10-23T22:41:56  <jkl__> on the cloud branch
2010-10-23T22:42:10  <jkl__> {"path" : player_two_path, "command" : player_two["command"], "submission_id": player_one["submission_id"]}
2010-10-23T22:42:15  <janzert> ouch
2010-10-23T22:42:19  <jkl__> player two's path, player 1's id
2010-10-23T22:42:38  <jkl__> serious bummer
2010-10-23T22:42:54  <jkl__> checking trunk
2010-10-23T22:42:57  <janzert> so is it used for anything other than error reporting?
2010-10-23T22:43:06  <jkl__> I don't know
2010-10-23T22:43:16  <jkl__> there are i's and i+1's in a lot of places
2010-10-23T22:43:17  <janzert> ok, looking now
2010-10-23T22:43:30  <jkl__> and you also have player_one and player_two
2010-10-23T22:43:38  <jkl__> lots of different ways to refer to the players

2010-10-23T22:44:46  <jkl__> trunk doesn't have that code
2010-10-23T22:44:59  <jkl__> it doesn't do any error reporting to the DB
2010-10-23T22:45:19  <janzert> luckily the submission id there seems to only be used for the error reporting
2010-10-23T22:45:35  <janzert> yeah, that's why worker 0 never has a error shown in the visualizer
2010-10-23T22:45:55  <janzert> yay, thanks for finding it
2010-10-23T22:48:24  <jkl__> One down, two to go.
2010-10-23T22:48:57  <janzert> you're jklandis on the tracker I take it?

2010-10-23T22:50:11  <janzert> hope so since that's who I attributed it to in the commit message :)
2010-10-23T22:50:49  <jkl__> Yes
2010-10-23T22:51:05  <jkl__> I wrote a note about the fix on the bug tracker.
2010-10-23T22:51:30  <jkl__> Can you close it?
2010-10-23T22:51:50  <janzert> yes, I will just getting the server updated
2010-10-23T22:53:17  <jkl__> Great.  I wrote a note on 199 about what you just said about reporting.  That explains why some games just end.
2010-10-23T22:55:49  <janzert> yep
2010-10-23T22:56:06  <janzert> I didn't realize 199 was specifically about worker 0 before
2010-10-23T22:56:31  <jkl__> I just noticed that myself.
2010-10-23T22:56:56  <jkl__> I'm satisfied at least knowing that it is expected behavior
2010-10-23T22:57:12  <jkl__> Even if it isn't perfect behavior
2010-10-23T22:57:25  <janzert> yeah, it really does need to get fixed soon
2010-10-23T22:57:43  <janzert> just wish there were a few more people active in the code :)
2010-10-23T22:57:49  <janzert> thanks for taking a look at it
2010-10-23T22:58:12  <jkl__> So let's see
2010-10-23T22:58:18  <jkl__> how hard it would be

2010-10-23T22:58:54  <jkl__> I guess you would have to merge engine.py, since that is what actually tracks the errors
2010-10-23T22:59:04  <jkl__> Then you have to get the data into the db
2010-10-23T22:59:25  <janzert> right and the main server tournament manager deals directly with the db of course

2010-10-23T23:00:27  <jkl__> So it's some Python and SQL work
2010-10-23T23:02:10  <janzert> right

2010-10-23T23:06:31  <jkl__> The plan is to port just the error stuff from the cloud engine, and then copy the error-reporting SQL from the PHP submission relay into the trunk tournament manager.
2010-10-23T23:07:31  <janzert> I haven't looked at the changes made to the cloud engine, but can it be brought back over whole?
2010-10-23T23:07:59  <janzert> i.e. so trunk and the cloud branch will be back to the same engine.py?
2010-10-23T23:08:31  <jkl__> Maybe.  Trunk is doing something with selectable I/O
2010-10-23T23:08:44  <janzert> oh, yeah I remember that now.
2010-10-23T23:09:05  <janzert> I saw that when I was bringing svn back into sync with the server
2010-10-23T23:09:10  <jkl__> I don't understand what is going on.  There are threads, non-blocking reads, and now select
2010-10-23T23:09:38  <janzert> I really think that is just a failed experiment actually but it is what was in use so I decided just to stick it into svn for now at least

2010-10-23T23:10:22  <jkl__> I'm still convinced that a scheduling issue is at the heart of 202, and overzealous polling may be part of the problem.  But one bug at a time...
2010-10-23T23:11:14  <janzert> I really want to rewrite it leave the threads and blocking reads in place and just have the i/o threads signal the main thread with an event
2010-10-23T23:11:28  <janzert> seems like the easiest way to clean it up from where we are now
2010-10-23T23:11:29  <contestbot> Top 10 players: Hazard(3949), rsergio(3932), felixcoto(3927), bocsimacko(3916), cfaftw(3883), davidjliu(3858), dmj111(3811), sin_sun(3802), jambachili(3775), savchenko(3745)
2010-10-23T23:11:51  <janzert> but yeah for now probably best just to merge the error reporting back in
2010-10-23T23:12:05  <jkl__> I was just about to change my mind.
2010-10-23T23:12:10  <janzert> another case of trying to fix one bug and butting into another
2010-10-23T23:12:26  <jkl__> If the cloud and trunk run exactly the same code, it will be much easier to track down problems
2010-10-23T23:12:35  <jkl__> In the diff I see the error code and the selector code
2010-10-23T23:12:36  <janzert> whichever you feel up to then
2010-10-23T23:12:59  <jkl__> also, outcome["engine_stats
2010-10-23T23:13:02  <jkl__> "]
2010-10-23T23:13:05  <janzert> I'm going to try and finish up a fix in the worker submission download code
2010-10-23T23:13:39  <jkl__> OK
2010-10-23T23:14:00  <janzert> then go back to figuring out why workers are sometimes requesting submissions that no longer exist :P
2010-10-23T23:14:26  <janzert> I'm not sure how many layers of bugs deep I'm working on any more :(
2010-10-23T23:14:46  <jkl__> You're 3 levels deep.  You could spend your whole life down there.
2010-10-23T23:14:57  <jkl__> Here's the kick

2010-10-23T23:32:56  <jkl__> Threads in the game server engine
2010-10-23T23:33:11  <jkl__> You have two bots running at the same time, and you have to multiplex I/O somehow
2010-10-23T23:33:24  <jkl__> one approach is to use blocking I/O in threads
2010-10-23T23:33:43  <jkl__> Another approach is to poll using non-blocking reads
2010-10-23T23:34:37  <jkl__> Right now the code does... both.
2010-10-23T23:36:14  <janzert> ok, one more pain point in setting up test servers assuaged. the countries and user_status_code database info is now in svn
2010-10-23T23:36:40  <jkl__> I have the engine patch ready
