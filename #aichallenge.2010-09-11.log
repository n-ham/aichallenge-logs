2010-09-11T00:04:39  <amstan> j3camero: you know you can use the vactoids
2010-09-11T00:04:51  <amstan> Zannick: match is not done yet
2010-09-11T00:05:14  <amstan> j3camero: factoids* : contestbot: learn key as value
2010-09-11T00:05:27  <amstan> j3camero: then you use contestbot: what key , and it replies value
2010-09-11T00:05:29  <Zannick> amstan: kk
2010-09-11T00:05:36  <amstan> Zannick: game is though..
2010-09-11T00:06:02  <amstan> contestbot: game 4434405
2010-09-11T00:06:03  <contestbot> amstan: Game played at 2010-09-10 22:14:54, on map 700, dmj111 beat albert. http://ai-contest.com/visualizer_canvas.php?game_id=4434405
2010-09-11T00:07:08  <jmcarthur> are we going to be able to use usernames in place of ids for the match command?
2010-09-11T00:07:21  <amstan> jmcarthur: yes, once i get the json done
2010-09-11T00:07:24  <jmcarthur> awesome
2010-09-11T00:07:35  <j3camero> amstan: thanks
2010-09-11T00:07:36  <amstan> jmcarthur: ids won't work anyway, same problem
2010-09-11T00:07:49  <Zannick> hm
2010-09-11T00:07:55  <amstan> jmcarthur: gameinfo was easy because game_info.php already exists
2010-09-11T00:08:15  <Zannick> shall i change the link for games on the profile page to visualizer_canvas?
2010-09-11T00:08:39  <amstan> Zannick: idk about that yet, i think there was a reason we didn't just replace the java one directly

2010-09-11T00:15:30  <Zannick> amstan: sure, so someone is reminded to change it when you've decided?
2010-09-11T00:18:35  <Zannick> okay, done.
2010-09-11T00:18:46  <j3camero> Okay I am going to bed. I will be back at it pretty much all day tomorrow.
2010-09-11T00:18:48  <Zannick> i am now going to work on my bot

2010-09-11T00:22:16  <sigh> :)
2010-09-11T00:22:29  <Zannick> depends on your definition of "is", contestbot
2010-09-11T00:23:26  <RobotCaleb> since contestbot always replies to sigh with "sigh: " I am reminded of Marvin the depressed robot
2010-09-11T00:24:06  <sigh> well, everything he's told me so far has been very negative :P
2010-09-11T00:24:27  <Zannick> sigh. Error: "doesn't" is not a valid command.

2010-09-11T00:29:13  <amstan> now it totally failed
2010-09-11T00:29:20  <sigh> amstan: the visualiser is broken for that game too
2010-09-11T00:29:26  <millertime> server is taking a 5 minute break.
2010-09-11T00:29:34  <RobotCaleb> Might as well take contestbot out back
2010-09-11T00:29:38  <millertime> it's having a smoke out by the shed.
2010-09-11T00:29:56  <amstan> aha.. this time it couldn't parse it..
2010-09-11T00:30:57  <antimatroid1> oh god, rewriting planetwars is painful
2010-09-11T00:31:04  <RobotCaleb> I just want to note that a1k0n is insane. :)
2010-09-11T00:31:06  <amstan> antimatroid1: rewriting?
2010-09-11T00:31:10  <amstan> RobotCaleb: how so?
2010-09-11T00:31:34  <RobotCaleb> I worked on the MarioAI challenge with him and then another failed project after that. He's intimidating. :)
2010-09-11T00:31:48  <amstan> RobotCaleb: lol
2010-09-11T00:31:56  <amstan> he's a pretty awesome guy
2010-09-11T00:32:04  <j3camero> a1k0n is the bomb, just so you know.
2010-09-11T00:32:14  <RobotCaleb> I'm not arguing any of that.
2010-09-11T00:32:25  <amstan> Ode to a1k0n
2010-09-11T00:32:26  <j3camero> a1k0n: he is probably 4 to 7 times better than me at... everything.
2010-09-11T00:32:37  <j3camero> hehe
2010-09-11T00:32:54  <amstan> j3camero: that's why we host... not play
2010-09-11T00:32:58  <amstan> lol
2010-09-11T00:33:45  <amstan> j3camero: where do the numbers come from? lol
2010-09-11T00:34:54  <sigh> woohoo... broke into the top 10

2010-09-11T00:37:28  <millertime> been seeing a common strategy: sending just enough ships to neutral planets to be able to take them
2010-09-11T00:37:44  <amstan> millertime: isn't that a very bad idea?
2010-09-11T00:38:02  <millertime> well ideally it gets you a lot of planets...
2010-09-11T00:38:18  <millertime> but you're right. the downside would be when the enemy hits it at the same time
2010-09-11T00:38:21  <dstufft> amstan: id say it depends, it allows you to spread yourself out more to get lots of planets, but each of those are more vulnerable
2010-09-11T00:38:55  <antimatroid1> amstan: pretty much, I can't stand private variables/functions (I'm a communist in that respect), and I want to set fleets and planets up better
2010-09-11T00:39:25  <sigh> millertime: downside is when your enemy hits the turn *after*
2010-09-11T00:39:42  <millertime> exactly [what i meant]
2010-09-11T00:39:58  <sigh> ah
2010-09-11T00:40:10  <bss03> Well, RageBot still beats my bot. :(  I guess I just don't apply enough pressure. :(
2010-09-11T00:40:21  <sigh> RageBot is suprisingly good
2010-09-11T00:40:37  <bss03> I beat him on 43 of the example maps.  (Both bots are deterministic, so that's an always.)
2010-09-11T00:41:08  <sigh> with RageBot you need to learn to defend
2010-09-11T00:41:28  <sigh> the starter pack strategies have nothing to do with defence, so it lets you down there
2010-09-11T00:41:45  <bss03> Hrm, okay.  That's what I was gonna work on next anyway.
2010-09-11T00:42:02  *** phreeza <phreeza!~phreeza@f054171092.adsl.alicedsl.de> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-09-11T00:42:12  <antimatroid1> hmmm, if i have external variables in my bot, and it plays against itself, is that going to be a problem?
2010-09-11T00:42:29  <amstan> antimatroid1: ... no
2010-09-11T00:42:35  <millertime> sigh: ragebot has been my main tough point.. and i agree with you but just dont know good defense tactics
2010-09-11T00:42:38  <dstufft> antimatroid1: each bot runs it's own instance to my knowledge
2010-09-11T00:42:41  <bss03> Right now, I never send fleets to my own planets, and rarely leave many defenders. >:)
2010-09-11T00:42:59  <antimatroid1> okay, just wasn't entirely sure how external varialbes work
2010-09-11T00:43:05  <amstan> antimatroid1: the 2 bots and the engine don't share any variables
2010-09-11T00:43:26  <antimatroid1> external variable in that i intend it to be indexible across files
2010-09-11T00:43:28  <amstan> antimatroid1: they're external processes, and communicate with stdin and stdout
2010-09-11T00:43:51  <antimatroid1> i will just do it and see how I go :)
2010-09-11T00:43:53  <antimatroid1> cheers
2010-09-11T00:43:58  <millertime> sigh: maybe buffing up weak planets when you're being beaten?
2010-09-11T00:44:10  <bss03> animatroid1: I think you'd have to work hard to share data between your bots.
2010-09-11T00:44:29  <sigh> bss03, millertime: I just treat my planets that are under attack the same way I treat enemy planets
2010-09-11T00:44:43  <antimatroid1> i don't want to share data between bots, just files, i want to avoid the accessing those variables across files from happening across bots
2010-09-11T00:44:51  <antimatroid1> the more i think about it the more my worry seems retarded ;)
2010-09-11T00:44:56  <sigh> The only tricky bit is projecting how many ships will be need to keep it under my control
2010-09-11T00:45:02  <bss03> antimatroid1: Like use something persistent but not a file -- maybe persisent shared memory segment or something.
2010-09-11T00:45:23  <antimatroid1> i can use external variables in c++
2010-09-11T00:45:30  <millertime> sigh: is there available data about incoming attacks?
2010-09-11T00:45:34  <antimatroid1> i will test whether they affect each other, i don't think they will
2010-09-11T00:45:46  <dstufft> millertime: you can get a list of all the fleets in the universe from what ive seen
2010-09-11T00:45:46  <antimatroid1> millertime: fleets vector
2010-09-11T00:45:54  <sigh> yes, look at the destination planet in the fleets
2010-09-11T00:46:00  <dstufft> source, destination, owner, turns till they reach
2010-09-11T00:46:09  <dstufft> atleast in the python project i have
2010-09-11T00:46:15  <millertime> wow, that sounds like it gets complex
2010-09-11T00:46:48  <sigh> I know the c++ pack has a GetFleets() method in the PlanetWars class, other langages should be similar
2010-09-11T00:47:00  <sigh> millertime: If it wasn't complex, it wouldn't be fun :P
2010-09-11T00:47:28  * bss03 agrees with sigh.  Complexity = fun.
2010-09-11T00:47:43  <millertime> complexity = debug time
2010-09-11T00:48:01  <millertime> took me long enough to fix the 50 bugs i had in my current bot :P
2010-09-11T00:48:04  <sigh> oops sorry, the functions are MyFleets() and EnemyFleets()
2010-09-11T00:48:13  <bss03> I love watching the really good bots kick the crap outta me.  Always gives me ideas on how to improve things.
2010-09-11T00:48:19  <sigh> stop writing bugs then :D
2010-09-11T00:48:28  <bss03> Wins are also fun to watch, but they just don't seem to have as much information.

2010-09-11T00:48:53  <millertime> well thank you, i will do more research/tweaking and possibly try to incorporate some sort of defense
2010-09-11T00:48:57  <millertime> gotta beat this stupid ragebot
2010-09-11T00:49:07  <millertime> but first -- taco bell!
2010-09-11T00:49:15  <RobotCaleb> blech

2010-09-11T00:49:41  <RobotCaleb> The letters are so close to each other
2010-09-11T00:49:59  * bss03 hands millertime my last $5.
2010-09-11T00:50:46  <bss03> RobotCaleb: My "typos" are mostly my brain getting ahead of my hands, and my lack of grounding in touch-typing.
2010-09-11T00:51:03  <Zannick> um
2010-09-11T00:51:12  <RobotCaleb> Totally. Sometimes if I don't pay attention I'll type whole sentences that I didn't mean
2010-09-11T00:51:33  <Zannick> www.ai-contest.com/visualizer_canvas.php?game_id=4433459 appears to have trouble displaying turn 33
2010-09-11T00:51:52  <bss03> I have a bad habit or leaving out the "not" or "n't" in a sentence.  Screws up my meaning badly. :(
2010-09-11T00:52:04  <Zannick> ...and turn 65
2010-09-11T00:52:19  <Zannick> i think it has problems displaying turns without fleets
2010-09-11T00:52:51  <bss03> I saw that with my early bot.  It'll "stop" on turns without fleets, which is sorta wierd.
2010-09-11T00:53:21  <dstufft> maybe it assumes fleets and get's struck trying to render nothing
2010-09-11T00:54:39  <sigh> Zannick's link is not even loading for me :(
2010-09-11T00:56:28  <RobotCaleb> the java planet wars visualizer needs variable speed playback
2010-09-11T00:57:14  <sigh> it would also be nice if they allowed you to skip to an arbitrary point in the game
2010-09-11T00:57:26  <RobotCaleb> a scrubber!
2010-09-11T00:57:58  <sigh> scrubber?
2010-09-11T00:58:57  <RobotCaleb> video players have sliders that move through the video
2010-09-11T00:59:00  <RobotCaleb> that's a scrubber
2010-09-11T00:59:07  <sigh> ah, hadn
2010-09-11T00:59:14  <sigh> hadn't heard that term before
2010-09-11T00:59:37  <RobotCaleb> TIL the term macroblocking
2010-09-11T01:00:25  <sigh> are you from reddit? :P
2010-09-11T01:00:38  <rwa> is there hope in sight for server relief?
2010-09-11T01:00:40  <RobotCaleb> heh
2010-09-11T01:01:10  <sigh> I haven't heard the term TIL outside of reddit
2010-09-11T01:01:18  <RobotCaleb> nor I, but it works quite well
2010-09-11T01:01:27  <sigh> :)
2010-09-11T01:01:29  <RobotCaleb> I use it outside of reddit, but haven't heard anyone else
2010-09-11T01:01:40  <sigh> fair enough
2010-09-11T01:01:43  <RobotCaleb> I try to keep it out of spoken conversation
2010-09-11T01:01:53  <RobotCaleb> As with most acronyms
2010-09-11T01:02:08  <RobotCaleb> rather, as with most internet acronyms
2010-09-11T01:02:08  <sigh> haha, yeah... that would be as stupid has saying "lol" out loud
2010-09-11T01:02:15  <sigh> (yes i've heard it being done)
2010-09-11T01:02:18  <rwa> I've heard people do that
2010-09-11T01:02:22  <RobotCaleb> :(
2010-09-11T01:03:06  <sigh> haha, RobotCaleb.faith_in_humanity--
2010-09-11T01:03:25  <Zannick> lol
2010-09-11T01:03:36  <Zannick> loll
2010-09-11T01:03:42  <Zannick> loll is a word :P
2010-09-11T01:03:55  <sigh> indeed
2010-09-11T01:04:12  <RobotCaleb> I can't say I've ever seen it used in a non-past tense form, though
2010-09-11T01:04:24  <RobotCaleb> well, maybe "lolling", but never "loll"
2010-09-11T01:06:17  <PurplePanda> i heard some one say "i lolled out loud" out loud on the train last week
2010-09-11T01:06:32  <antimatroid1> i laughed out loud out loud
2010-09-11T01:06:56  <Zannick> you heard someone say they laughed out loud out loud out loud on the train?

2010-09-11T01:12:04  <sigh> hmmm... the match pairings seem random, wouldn't it be better if bots were matched up with opponents closer to their rank?
2010-09-11T01:12:34  <dstufft> sigh: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=23
2010-09-11T01:12:37  <Zannick> we're waiting on j3camero to push that change to trunk
2010-09-11T01:13:01  <sigh> ah, cool
2010-09-11T01:13:31  <antimatroid1> how many moves are there? if i give the engine 50 turns, it does 0, 1, ..., 50, so 51 turns?
2010-09-11T01:13:32  <Zannick> dstufft: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=68
2010-09-11T01:13:47  <antimatroid1> i know the thing is set at 200
2010-09-11T01:13:50  <antimatroid1> but is that 200 or 201
2010-09-11T01:14:29  <Zannick> 200
2010-09-11T01:14:55  <Zannick> the server engine starts at 1 and goes to 200
2010-09-11T01:15:20  <Mathnerd314> Say someone has 0 ships on a planet w/ 0 growth. If you send 1 ship, you take it over and have... how many ships?
2010-09-11T01:15:25  <Zannick> 1
2010-09-11T01:15:45  <Zannick> if you see something else, you have an unpatched engine
2010-09-11T01:15:51  <dstufft> trying to navigate the issues page, why are all issue trackers terrible
2010-09-11T01:16:45  <Mathnerd314> Zannick: say I instead send 0 ships. Do I now own the planet with 0 ships? :p
2010-09-11T01:16:59  <dstufft> i think 0 ships is illegal
2010-09-11T01:17:03  <dstufft> a fleet w/ 0 ships i mean
2010-09-11T01:17:36  <Zannick> it should be illegal or ignored
2010-09-11T01:17:47  <Zannick> but since 0 is not greater than 0 you won't conquer it
2010-09-11T01:17:51  <sigh> is it possible to own a planet with 0 ships?
2010-09-11T01:18:05  <rwa> sigh: no
2010-09-11T01:18:09  <Zannick> yes
2010-09-11T01:18:30  <Zannick> if, after growth, you are attacked with the exact number of ships on your planet
2010-09-11T01:18:31  <rwa> 0 is not neutral by def?
2010-09-11T01:18:42  <sigh> fair enough, thanks
2010-09-11T01:19:11  <Zannick> reducing a planet to 0 does not change its ownership
2010-09-11T01:19:45  <Mathnerd314> most actual games I've played have minimum ship count 1 to avoid this
2010-09-11T01:20:07  <rwa> bug, imo.  0 pop cannot grow.
2010-09-11T01:20:22  <PurplePanda> yes it can
2010-09-11T01:20:40  <rwallace> Is it anywhere documented, what protocol a bot must follow for input and output? Not the format, that is straightforward enough, but the actual sequence of reads and writes that must take place?
2010-09-11T01:20:41  <rwa> yeah, that's the bug
2010-09-11T01:21:06  <rwallace> I've spent the last two hours trying to debug input/output code, and I can't make any bloody sense of what's going on
2010-09-11T01:21:07  <Mathnerd314> rwa: the planet is still allied to you, despite you having "abandoned" it
2010-09-11T01:21:18  <PurplePanda> if you own a factory it will keep going even when there are no soldiers there :-)
2010-09-11T01:21:37  <Zannick> rwallace: the format is simple, like you said
2010-09-11T01:21:55  <Zannick> a bot does not have to read at all
2010-09-11T01:22:21  <a1k0n> hey sup
2010-09-11T01:22:28  <PurplePanda> it does if it wants to know the state of the universe
2010-09-11T01:22:29  <Zannick> output is orders, followed by a line that just says "go"
2010-09-11T01:22:40  <Zannick> there isn't a sequence
2010-09-11T01:22:45  <rwallace> Zannick, oh doesn't it? Try taking the Java starter pack and replacing the code with just plain output of the 'go' line, and watch the engine reporting the result as having crashed
2010-09-11T01:22:46  <a1k0n> did anyone ever figure out what's up with playgame.jar in some subset of configurations not working?
2010-09-11T01:23:06  <Zannick> since they are two separate pipes on the server
2010-09-11T01:23:07  <a1k0n> (my two year old says "playgame playgame playgame" all the time btw, and i can't help but think of that)
2010-09-11T01:23:28  <Zannick> rwallace: i'm sorry
2010-09-11T01:23:55  <Zannick> java is borked on my computer for some stupid reason and i don't feel like fixing it
2010-09-11T01:24:01  <a1k0n> yeah, if you try to run a bot that's "yes go" it totally doesn't work
2010-09-11T01:24:14  <a1k0n> i think the input parsing on that thing is just totally bonkers
2010-09-11T01:24:29  <dstufft> contestbot: what sampledb
2010-09-11T01:24:29  <contestbot> dstufft: sampledb = http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/sample.sql
2010-09-11T01:24:32  <Zannick> and the client engine is still buggy
2010-09-11T01:24:37  <a1k0n> yeah?
2010-09-11T01:24:40  <rwallace> a1k0n, so at least I'm not hallucinating :-) I don't suppose you have any idea what the actual story is?
2010-09-11T01:24:47  <a1k0n> haven't figured it out
2010-09-11T01:24:59  <rwallace> I'll try posting a question on the forum
2010-09-11T01:25:03  *** dhartmei <dhartmei!~dhartmei@106-30.3-213.fix.bluewin.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-11T01:25:06  <a1k0n> but it seems work on my actual bot isn't really necessary at this point so i'll just work on that
2010-09-11T01:25:15  <a1k0n> (man i'm such a dick)
2010-09-11T01:25:17  <rwallace> I mean, presumably whoever wrote the Java starter pack, must have figured out what the protocol was
2010-09-11T01:25:50  <Zannick> the author of the protocol
2010-09-11T01:26:20  <millertime> bss03: haha, sorry! i left too quick :P
2010-09-11T01:26:27  <Zannick> most starter bots go: read input until 'go', parse, output orders, output 'go', repeat
2010-09-11T01:26:29  <millertime> now i have to spend your $5 on beer
2010-09-11T01:26:48  <rwallace> Zannick, yes, that's what I'm doing, but it gets reported as having crashed
2010-09-11T01:27:21  <Zannick> as actually crashed?
2010-09-11T01:27:29  <Zannick> as opposed to "timed out"?
2010-09-11T01:27:53  <rwallace> Yes. Timed out happens when you try to read past the last line of input, which is annoying, but at least comprehensible
2010-09-11T01:28:00  <rwallace> This is different
2010-09-11T01:28:27  <Zannick> the engine reports "crashed" when there's an error on it reading from the pipe
2010-09-11T01:28:44  <Zannick> you might be throwing an exception?
2010-09-11T01:29:16  <rwallace> nope, I wrapped my code in an exception handler that writes to a log file. And verified that the log file writing is working correctly
2010-09-11T01:29:31  <Zannick> copy a map to testmap.txt, put "go" on the last line, then run java MyBot < testmap.txt
2010-09-11T01:29:49  <Zannick> this will simulate your bot for one turn and its output will be shown

2010-09-11T01:31:54  <Zeiris> Security issues?
2010-09-11T01:41:41  <Mathnerd314> Zeiris: difficulties updating; if you can get a recent GHC on Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 server, then go for it
2010-09-11T01:42:56  <Zeiris> How about the latest Haskell platform?
2010-09-11T01:43:14  <Zeiris> I recall that being fairly easy to install, as long as you ensure the new binaries are in your path, not old ones.
2010-09-11T01:43:41  <Zeiris> Benefit of the Platform is you'd get many of the common libraries installed as well :)
2010-09-11T01:45:16  <Mathnerd314> I don't remember much of the details; ping jmcarthur. But I think he wants to use GHC head and submit binaries.

2010-09-11T02:02:04  <antimatroid1> is it possible to be told the average time each bot took to make their moves in a game?
2010-09-11T02:02:12  <antimatroid1> i think that'd be interesting to see among the top bots
2010-09-11T02:02:35  <antimatroid1> Zannik: :D
2010-09-11T02:02:53  <a1k0n> mine takes like 10ms
2010-09-11T02:03:02  <antimatroid1> yeah, i mean like later in the competition
2010-09-11T02:03:05  <a1k0n> yeah
2010-09-11T02:03:14  <antimatroid1> would be interesting to see what top bots are taking what time
2010-09-11T02:03:25  <a1k0n> well i expect it'll be either like, 995ms or 50ms
2010-09-11T02:03:36  <a1k0n> e.g. searching vs heuristics
2010-09-11T02:03:43  <a1k0n> s/e.g./i.e./
2010-09-11T02:03:54  <antimatroid1> i think you can easily use up a decent chunk of time with heuristics
2010-09-11T02:03:59  <antimatroid1> dependent on how good they are
2010-09-11T02:04:54  <Cyndre> wow, been trying to submit for so long :(
2010-09-11T02:05:32  <antimatroid1> i wonder how many people will seriously enter this time
2010-09-11T02:05:34  <bss03> I want to submit before I go to bed.  I made a lot of changes since my last submission.
2010-09-11T02:05:40  <antimatroid1> i hope it's at least reasonably competitive for top 100
2010-09-11T02:05:58  <antimatroid1> imo if you put a decent search one in last time you ranked fairly high
2010-09-11T02:06:02  <bss03> I can sometimes beat RageBot, which didn't happen at all before.
2010-09-11T02:06:26  <bss03> Website down-ish again?
2010-09-11T02:07:01  <Cyndre> anyone have a batch already written for running through a bunch of bots on all the maps?
2010-09-11T02:07:40  <dstufft> Cyndre: i have a python script but atm it only supports python/java bots
2010-09-11T02:07:41  <bss03> I have all the maps vs. one bot.
2010-09-11T02:07:53  <bss03> So it could be an inner part of your loop.
2010-09-11T02:07:57  <dstufft> it does a list of bots vs that list + example bots
2010-09-11T02:08:10  <Cyndre> I have a python bot :)
2010-09-11T02:08:19  <dstufft> it takes a long fucking time though

2010-09-11T02:25:25  <amstan> and it's only going to get worse
2010-09-11T02:25:59  <sigh> really, having the website up is more important than having the bots run, atm
2010-09-11T02:26:01  <sigh> imo
2010-09-11T02:26:20  <amstan> i agree..
2010-09-11T02:26:30  <dstufft> is it to late to split the www to it's own server
2010-09-11T02:26:32  <Cyndre> could you do like a google cloud thing and just have the server run bots and accept uploads and then submit results to google cloud?
2010-09-11T02:26:45  <pgpaskar_> apache just sent me the css
2010-09-11T02:26:47  <pgpaskar_> for aicontest.com
2010-09-11T02:26:48  <pgpaskar_> lmfao
2010-09-11T02:26:50  <bss03> dstuft: Really?  It's tied together than closely?
2010-09-11T02:26:55  <pgpaskar_> pageload! :D
2010-09-11T02:27:03  <dstufft> bss03: no i'm am asking
2010-09-11T02:27:06  <dstufft> if it's too late
2010-09-11T02:27:12  <pgpaskar_> w/e im going to sleep
2010-09-11T02:27:13  <rwa> amstan: what's the limiting factor here?  if you had some money to get server time would that fix it, or are there issues in that everything was set up to work on the same machine?
2010-09-11T02:27:16  <amstan> dstufft: maybe not, we had it split last term
2010-09-11T02:27:20  <pgpaskar_> hopefully you guys can figure this out amstan :P
2010-09-11T02:27:30  <amstan> rwa: i have no idea, jeff is doing all of this
2010-09-11T02:27:44  <dstufft> is jeff j3camero ?
2010-09-11T02:27:51  <dstufft> or is that someone else
2010-09-11T02:27:56  <amstan> yes
2010-09-11T02:28:22  <bss03> I'm broke, but it seems like if 20 of us pitched in 20 bucks we could get a slice somewhere that would be beefy enough to handle the www stuff.
2010-09-11T02:28:23  <dstufft> ok
2010-09-11T02:28:27  <amstan> the server that runs hypertriangle.com is more powerful than what he has..
2010-09-11T02:28:39  <amstan> and i brought it at a surplus sale for $30
2010-09-11T02:28:42  <dstufft> lol
2010-09-11T02:28:53  <bss03> At least until Dec. 1 or so.
2010-09-11T02:29:02  <dstufft> any idea how much www trafic there is?
2010-09-11T02:29:17  <Cyndre> dstufft: should make the script put the winners name after each match
2010-09-11T02:29:26  <amstan> dstufft: it's not the traffic, it has 2 logical cpus, and they're both at 100%
2010-09-11T02:29:56  <dstufft> amstan: yea i understand, i'm just rolling thoughts around in my head about the possiblities of splitting www off to it's own
2010-09-11T02:29:58  <bss03> I think the goal is something like 20*10^6 page views or smth like that for the whole contest.
2010-09-11T02:30:01  <rwa> a phone call needs to go into google to gently remind them that their name is on this server which is sputtering...
2010-09-11T02:30:09  <amstan> but seriously, compare ai-challenge.com: http://pastebin.com/E4Zjdcs3
2010-09-11T02:30:21  <amstan> with hypertriangle.com, from surplus sale: http://pastebin.com/kEucBPTX
2010-09-11T02:31:10  <bss03> My 5 year old desktop is faster than that! :P
2010-09-11T02:31:12  <dstufft> amstan: you said it's the bot's holding things up? Not apache at all?
2010-09-11T02:31:12  <sigh> what is hypertriangle.com?
2010-09-11T02:31:27  <amstan> dstufft: bots, mysqld, and then apache
2010-09-11T02:31:33  <amstan> sigh: a server that i run
2010-09-11T02:31:41  <amstan> sigh: from my residential dsl line

2010-09-11T02:32:10  <bss03> Jeff did mention that maybe he wanted to limit the bots to 500ms or even 200ms maybe.  I guess that might take some load off. *shrug*
2010-09-11T02:32:38  <bss03> @rank

2010-09-11T02:32:43  <bss03> @alias rank
2010-09-11T02:32:45  <dstufft> well honestly the www should be split off to it's own server
2010-09-11T02:32:47  <dstufft> lol
2010-09-11T02:32:54  <contestbot> bss03: Error: There was a problem accessing the interface to ai-contest.com
2010-09-11T02:33:04  <dstufft> that would be a better solution then limiting the bots
2010-09-11T02:33:10  <antimatroid1> do planet id's start from 0 or 1?
2010-09-11T02:33:15  <rwa> dstufft: yes
2010-09-11T02:33:19  <amstan> dstufft: it's not exactly the bots..
2010-09-11T02:33:27  <amstan> dstufft: they can be slowed down..
2010-09-11T02:33:28  <bss03> antimatroid: in the Haskell version they start at 0.
2010-09-11T02:33:39  <amstan> dstufft: they'll still get their cpu time, just less matches played
2010-09-11T02:33:48  <rwa> which we don't want either
2010-09-11T02:33:50  <amstan> dstufft: problem is priorities
2010-09-11T02:34:03  <bss03> antimatroid: It's not in the wire protocol, so it'll probably be whatever array base your PL uses.
2010-09-11T02:34:04  <amstan> how can i renice all the apache workers?
2010-09-11T02:34:05  <Zaphus> limiting the bots would be bad...  especially after the rules were set at 1 second  - but limiting them wouldnt help if it still ran full steam ahead.  maybe he needs to throw a few seconds rest for the server in between each match
2010-09-11T02:34:07  <rwa> priority: more server!
2010-09-11T02:34:36  <Zaphus> or hit Google up for some help
2010-09-11T02:35:11  <bss03> ps -ef | awk '/apache/ { print $2} | xargs -l1 -- renice 10 -p
2010-09-11T02:35:28  <bss03> Change /apache/ to whatever regex matches them all.
2010-09-11T02:35:44  <dstufft> i think if you renice the parent process of apache, that should get transfered to any new child processes
2010-09-11T02:35:47  <amstan> can i get a second oppinion on that? is it wise?
2010-09-11T02:36:21  <amstan> problem is:
2010-09-11T02:36:22  <amstan> alex@alex-desktop:~$ ssh ai-contest.com -l amstan

2010-09-11T02:36:25  <bss03> dstufft is correct, processes inherit the priority of their parent.
2010-09-11T02:36:26  <amstan> alex@alex-desktop:~$
2010-09-11T02:36:40  <amstan> can't even ssh into it.. lol
2010-09-11T02:36:45  <sigh> :(
2010-09-11T02:37:11  <amstan> fun stuff
2010-09-11T02:37:12  <amstan> lol
2010-09-11T02:37:15  <dstufft> ouch
2010-09-11T02:37:24  <bss03> My xargs arguments are wrong -- it's "-n1" not "-l1".
2010-09-11T02:37:27  <Cyndre> its opening for me
2010-09-11T02:37:27  <amstan> yeah, screw this
2010-09-11T02:37:40  <amstan> if jeff doesn't get more servers there's very little hope
2010-09-11T02:37:46  <amstan> now.. what should i watch tonight?
2010-09-11T02:38:02  <dstufft> amstan: does there happen to be an ipkvm on the server?
2010-09-11T02:38:18  <amstan> dstufft: how would that make a difference?
2010-09-11T02:38:37  <dstufft> an ipkvm would let you get into the console out of band
2010-09-11T02:38:42  <dstufft> since ssh isn't working
2010-09-11T02:39:19  <amstan> dstufft: it probably needs a restart
2010-09-11T02:39:29  <amstan> to kill the tournament engine
2010-09-11T02:39:37  <dstufft> that would work too
2010-09-11T02:39:47  <amstan> what good is ipkvm if bash won't even start
2010-09-11T02:39:58  <bss03> amstan: Install memlockd and make sure the ssh binary, your shell binary, and the .sos the link with are locked in memory.
2010-09-11T02:40:33  <bss03> amstan: Then, you can at least (ssh box 'remote command here'), even under heavy swappage.
2010-09-11T02:40:42  <amstan> it's not swappage
2010-09-11T02:40:50  <amstan> ram usage is 600mb/2GB
2010-09-11T02:40:58  <a1k0n> it only has 2 gigs?!
2010-09-11T02:41:03  <amstan> it's the 100% of each of the logical..... cpus
2010-09-11T02:41:03  <bss03> LOL
2010-09-11T02:41:35  <kirkeby> amstan: You know if you're running apache with it's default configuration. There's usually a lot of room for improvement right there, like throwing a MaxChildren in to keep it from swamping your server with 250 PHP-MySQL-bound processes?
2010-09-11T02:41:35  <sigh> oh speaking on which, what are the memory constraints on the bots?
2010-09-11T02:41:46  <bss03> Seriously, I'm going to put $20 in an envelope.  Where can I mail it so we can get a real server?
2010-09-11T02:41:48  <amstan> kirkeby: but if i can't even ssh..
2010-09-11T02:42:14  <kirkeby> Yeah, then that won't help right now, but if you get into the box at some point...
2010-09-11T02:42:33  <amstan> idk what jeff was thinkings
2010-09-11T02:42:36  <amstan> thinking*
2010-09-11T02:43:23  <bss03> Stamps are ready; as are from-address mailing-labels; $s are in the envelope.
2010-09-11T02:43:29  <bss03> Address? :P
2010-09-11T02:43:43  <Zannick> do you guys have actual contacts at google?
2010-09-11T02:43:49  *** bss03 is now known as bss03-AFK
2010-09-11T02:44:23  <amstan> Zannick: jeff does
2010-09-11T02:44:58  <dstufft> is tournament_manager.sh executed by a cron or something
2010-09-11T02:45:26  <amstan> dstufft: i think he can turn it on and off
2010-09-11T02:45:42  <amstan> so.. idk
2010-09-11T02:45:46  <dstufft> (trying to get the flow of the program figured out)
2010-09-11T02:45:48  <amstan> i think it's in a screen session
2010-09-11T02:46:30  <amstan> we need more servers..
2010-09-11T02:47:20  <dstufft> i guess it's running more then one game at a time or something
2010-09-11T02:47:47  <Zannick> doubtful
2010-09-11T02:48:04  <amstan> pretty sure it is.. somehow
2010-09-11T02:48:10  <Zannick> but depending on the frequency tournament_manager.py is restarting, it's issuing a lot of large selects
2010-09-11T02:48:46  <Zannick> tournament_manager.py can only run one game at a time
2010-09-11T02:48:49  <dstufft> it looks like tournament_manager.py is started once per game
2010-09-11T02:48:54  <Zannick> there would have to be multiple instances
2010-09-11T02:49:00  <dstufft> yea
2010-09-11T02:49:14  <Zannick> not necessarily restarted each time, though
2010-09-11T02:49:44  <dstufft> looking at tournament_manager.py, atleast on the svn, it appears it is
2010-09-11T02:49:46  <Zannick> there's a while loop that it stays in for the commandline-given duration
2010-09-11T02:51:08  <Zannick> granted, each game can take up to 200 seconds, so if that number is small it's restarted every time
2010-09-11T02:51:26  <Zannick> er, it would be, depending on how it is run
2010-09-11T02:51:59  <Zannick> i assume it does restart every so often, because the select query is only done once per run, and it is necessary to grab new submissions regularly
2010-09-11T02:53:21  <dstufft> i'm really confused what this code is trying to do, while time.time() - start_time < time_limit: suggests that this loop is going to keep running until this particular game runs out of time
2010-09-11T02:53:37  <dstufft> but then in each iteration of the loop, it selects a new match up
2010-09-11T02:53:52  <dstufft> unless timeout is just supposed to be how long until this script itself dies
2010-09-11T02:53:56  <dstufft> to prevent memory leaks or w/e
2010-09-11T02:54:01  <dstufft> well not prevent

2010-09-11T02:55:32  <dstufft> yea that's what it's doing
2010-09-11T02:55:43  <dstufft> that timeout is like maxrequests for apache
2010-09-11T02:55:47  <dstufft> np Cyndre
2010-09-11T02:55:59  <Cyndre> that rage bot is a beast
2010-09-11T02:56:14  <rwa> rage bot on map 30 is interesting...
2010-09-11T02:56:59  <dstufft> so then my question would be, what timeout is tournament_manager.sh being called with, and how often is it being called with that
2010-09-11T02:57:12  <Cyndre> ouch - that was nasty
2010-09-11T02:57:24  <Cyndre> 12 turns player2  wins
2010-09-11T02:58:20  <dstufft> Cyndre: you can mod it to provide that output fairly easily, i mostly plan on making test.py run automatically with github hooks and publish results to a webpage
2010-09-11T02:58:44  <dstufft> so i havn't added a ton of useful output other then some basic stuff
2010-09-11T02:59:46  <Cyndre> nice
2010-09-11T03:00:58  <Palmik> dstufft, is the script publicly available? :)
2010-09-11T03:01:37  <dstufft> Palmik: sort of, i made a gist for it, but it's not "done", it does work for running tests and displaying the output on the shell
2010-09-11T03:01:58  <dstufft> output similar to what Cyndre pasted
2010-09-11T03:02:03  <dstufft> sec i'll get the gist link
2010-09-11T03:02:23  <dstufft> http://gist.github.com/574904
2010-09-11T03:02:33  <Palmik> Thank you very much :)
2010-09-11T03:02:58  <dstufft> test.py runs all the bots in bots.json against all the bots in bots.json + example.json (currently it only works for java and python bots)
2010-09-11T03:03:13  <dstufft> though adding in other bots would be easy
2010-09-11T03:03:31  <dstufft> just add a new elif to get_command for the language
2010-09-11T03:04:18  <dstufft> it's really slow though, since it runs every combination against all 100 maps
2010-09-11T03:04:47  <dstufft> (it's atleast smart enough to know that Bot1 vs Bot2 is the same as Bot2 vs Bot1)
2010-09-11T03:06:14  <Cyndre> made some changes and survived to turn 57 on map30 against ragebot
2010-09-11T03:06:23  <Cyndre> rerunning tests
2010-09-11T03:07:07  <dstufft> i also have a run.py that makes running bots easy lol
2010-09-11T03:07:15  <dstufft> but it only really makes it easier for python bots
2010-09-11T03:07:30  <Cyndre> 5/10 on ragebot now
2010-09-11T03:08:04  <dstufft> ./run.py stupidbot RageBot much easier then that long ass command

2010-09-11T03:11:34  <Palmik> Hmm, why does not it like this as the location? : "location": ["../example_bots", "DualBot.jar"]
2010-09-11T03:13:05  <dstufft> where is test.py in relation to example_bots/
2010-09-11T03:13:13  <dstufft> location is relative to test.py
2010-09-11T03:13:30  <Palmik> in /aaa/ directory :D
2010-09-11T03:14:01  <Palmik> well, I will have it in the same direcotory as /example_bots/ then
2010-09-11T03:14:53  <dstufft> ["..", "example_bots", "DualBot.jar"]
2010-09-11T03:14:56  <dstufft> try that
2010-09-11T03:15:03  <Palmik> ok
2010-09-11T03:15:13  <dstufft> it's using os.path.join(*location)
2010-09-11T03:15:23  <dstufft> well for java files anyways, forgot to didn't make it check
2010-09-11T03:15:32  <dstufft> forgot i*
2010-09-11T03:16:41  <dstufft> gotta run to the store (i have the script at /, my python bot at /botname.py, and /example_bots/DualBot.Jar) so that's the only thing i've tested

2010-09-11T03:20:46  <Cyndre> and DualBot?
2010-09-11T03:20:52  <bss03> Cyndre: That's a marked improvemnt from my current bot, which beats it on 0/100 maps.
2010-09-11T03:21:17  <bss03> Cyndre: I don't have a DualBot implementation, 'cause I'm using the unofficial Haskell starter package.
2010-09-11T03:21:32  <rwa> dualbot is much easier to beat consistently
2010-09-11T03:21:47  <bss03> Cyndre: I've got some more improvements to try and get 100/100 on RageBot.  After that, ...
2010-09-11T03:21:49  <Cyndre> 8/10
2010-09-11T03:22:16  <bss03> Cyndre: Or when I run out of simple improvements, I'll code up some more example bot implementations in Haskell and ...
2010-09-11T03:22:33  <Cyndre> how is everyone approaching this
2010-09-11T03:22:35  <bss03> Cyndre: Sumbit them to the guy that started the unofficial Haskell starter kit.
2010-09-11T03:22:44  <rwa> Cyndre: very carefully ;)
2010-09-11T03:23:07  <jerkface03> Anyone have a copy of the java starter package that they'd be able to forward me?
2010-09-11T03:23:08  <Cyndre> 5/10 on rage bot, 114 turns, 7/10 on dual bot 161 turns and others area all wins
2010-09-11T03:23:14  <bss03> Cyndre: Can you read Haskell?  My bot is Free Software.
2010-09-11T03:23:39  <Cyndre> I can give it a shot
2010-09-11T03:23:40  <bss03> Cyndre: http://github.com/stephen-smith/ai-contest-2010
2010-09-11T03:25:02  <bss03> Cyndre: Basically, I substract attackers from my available ships, then find some juicy planets to attack using a fairly simple heuristic...
2010-09-11T03:26:13  <bss03> Cyndre: I draw attackers from virtually all my planets, in proportion to how many ships they have available.
2010-09-11T03:26:24  <kirkeby> Great. The Java visualizer doesn't work on my netbook :/
2010-09-11T03:27:10  <bss03> Cyndre: Repating this each turn results in rapid expansion and some aggresion, but leaves my planets ill defended.
2010-09-11T03:27:13  <Cyndre> nice, currently Im only attacking if I can kill it all at once
2010-09-11T03:27:26  <Cyndre> and I look for best loss to growth rate gain
2010-09-11T03:27:37  <Cyndre> then check if I have a fleet incomming and dont send those ships off
2010-09-11T03:28:10  <bss03> Cyndre: There's still some pretty "easy" optimizations to my strategy, plus I need to add code to reinforce planets that are being attacked, if I can save them.
2010-09-11T03:28:11  <Cyndre> working on reinforcements or abandonment - not sure which is best - and deciding how to handle attacks
2010-09-11T03:28:17  <Cyndre> lmao
2010-09-11T03:29:01  <Cyndre> Im thinking sending them to my toughest planet and sending every ship from toughest to attacking planet
2010-09-11T03:29:26  <rwa> everybody should go to bed... so I can get my code uploaded
2010-09-11T03:29:30  <bss03> One thing is that even though I might attack 2-5 planets in a turn, I don't divvy up the fleet to my planets based on distance from the target.
2010-09-11T03:29:32  <Cyndre> lmao
2010-09-11T03:29:33  <dstufft> using 1 planet as your attack staging point?
2010-09-11T03:29:47  <Cyndre> bss03: thats something I want to work on as well
2010-09-11T03:29:51  <dstufft> that sounds like it'd end up wasting turns
2010-09-11T03:30:29  <bss03> Also, I think some of the maps might benefit from a "waypoint" system, and calculating that on the first turn shouldn't east up too much time.

2010-09-11T03:31:38  <bss03> Like if A -> C = 8, A -> B = 4, B -> C =4, then, at least most of the time, if you own A and B, you want to send troops from A to C via B.
2010-09-11T03:32:00  <bss03> That way, you can redirect them half-way if the situation changes.

2010-09-11T03:33:57  <Cyndre> do you only test against the ragebot and dualbot?
2010-09-11T03:34:13  <Cyndre> ie am I wasting time on the others?
2010-09-11T03:34:14  <bss03> It vastly overcommits to conquering a single planet, never attacks more than one planet in a turn, and may still completely miscalculate how many ships it takes to conquer an enemy planet.
2010-09-11T03:35:02  <bss03> I test against RandomBot first.  If I can't beat it 100/100, then I'm probably crashing, timing out, or sending illegal commands.
2010-09-11T03:35:28  <bss03> Against RageBot I don't know if a loss is a error like that or just bad play.
2010-09-11T03:35:46  <Cyndre> can anyone beat him often?
2010-09-11T03:35:50  <Cyndre> let alone all the time?

2010-09-11T03:36:21  <rwa> I can beat RageBot 95% of the time

2010-09-11T03:41:33  <Edgewort1> Is it just me, or is the website down?
2010-09-11T03:41:37  <dstufft> it's down
2010-09-11T03:41:37  <bss03> Still, I think being able to reinforce is going to be critical to breaking into the top.

2010-09-11T03:42:10  <vikhyat> Cyndre: i don't think abandoning is a good idea
2010-09-11T03:42:14  <bss03> I don't think abandoning is really a good idea.
2010-09-11T03:42:21  <dstufft> abandoning can be i think
2010-09-11T03:42:41  <bss03> For each ship you leave, it takes out one of theirs, so having them fly away is mostly a wash.
2010-09-11T03:42:44  <Cyndre> vikyat: Im thinking of sending ships from dead planet to toughest planet, and sending all ships from toughest back to retake
2010-09-11T03:43:03  <vikhyat> Cyndre: that would probably be a waste of turns
2010-09-11T03:43:19  <dstufft> oh i took abandoning to mean "let them kill the defense and take the planet"
2010-09-11T03:43:27  <dstufft> not get as many ships away as possible
2010-09-11T03:44:01  <Cyndre> reinforce if possible, but if its dead, why leave ships to die?
2010-09-11T03:44:14  <vikhyat> Cyndre: to make it easier to take back
2010-09-11T03:44:15  <bss03> Cyndre: Because they kill your opps ships.
2010-09-11T03:44:35  <bss03> Cyndre: If you are already ahead, it's a higher percentage of their fleet, so it hurts them more.
2010-09-11T03:44:59  <bss03> Cyndre: If you are behind, well, then maybe abandoning is good, but you are slipping further behind.
2010-09-11T03:45:16  <Cyndre> not abandoning but moving them somewhere more useful

2010-09-11T03:45:48  <millertime> to the devs: is there a dev server included in the ai-contest source?

2010-09-11T03:46:03  <dstufft> millertime: dev server?
2010-09-11T03:46:10  <Edgewort1> IMHO, it's better to try to keep the planet, because they lose the same amount of ships as you do, but you get to keep your 'income' -- If you can't save it however, you should take any planet you can with your ships on there.
2010-09-11T03:46:11  <dstufft> there is a localserver in the starter packs
2010-09-11T03:46:20  <bss03> When I say "abandoning" I mean abandoning the planet by removing all your ships.  Not abandoning your ship by leaving them on the planet but not sending reinforcements.

2010-09-11T03:55:41  <Palmik> btw, if you calculate all your spare ships first, and then you select some nasty planet to redirect them to, how do you go about distance? do you take average distance? Right now, all of my coordination happens only by chance, because I take planets with spare ships, sort planets, which would not be mine in the time the ships from the planet arrive there and then sort them by myGian + hisLoss / distance

2010-09-11T04:45:23  <Appleman1234> greghaynes, I think this is university of waterloo comp sci club
2010-09-11T04:45:35  <Edgeworth> Appleman1234: Well, I could reply in a overly literal fashion, but I'm not going to.
2010-09-11T04:45:36  <greghaynes> Yea, had to say it though
2010-09-11T04:45:51  <Appleman1234> with some sponsoring by google, to the tune of you can use our name on your competiton
2010-09-11T04:46:03  <greghaynes> I bet they sponsor more than that
2010-09-11T04:46:06  <greghaynes> I would hope...
2010-09-11T04:46:12  <Appleman1234> I don't know ...
2010-09-11T04:46:25  <Appleman1234> all I know is I tried to signup a week ago and it didn't let me
2010-09-11T04:46:46  <greghaynes> At least the test system is much better this year, so you can still work on your bot with the servers down
2010-09-11T04:46:55  <Appleman1234> I signed up today , about one day late, then I go to a birthday for cousins and come back and the site is down
2010-09-11T04:47:08  <Appleman1234> I haven't even taken a look at the starter package yet
2010-09-11T04:47:18  <greghaynes> Ah, maybe someone here has a vanilla one
2010-09-11T04:47:18  <Appleman1234> but thanks for the information regarding the test system
2010-09-11T04:47:20  <rwa> Appleman1234: also check out the tcp server...
2010-09-11T04:47:26  <Palmik> well, you can test you bot on benzedrine in the meantime
2010-09-11T04:47:33  <rwa> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/
2010-09-11T04:47:44  <Appleman1234> I have a vanilla starter package

2010-09-11T04:47:45  <greghaynes> Appleman1234: All the starter packs have a test app for running the bot
2010-09-11T04:47:47  <Appleman1234> thanks
2010-09-11T04:52:00  <Appleman1234> I wonder if the www site is being hosted by same site that hosts jpcameron.com
2010-09-11T04:52:14  <Appleman1234> as that also seems to be down

2010-09-11T05:39:33  <antimatroid1> wtf, i can get a debug statement out just before returning 1 on a function, but not directly after the call of it
2010-09-11T05:41:03  <vikhyat> returning 1 will exit the function
2010-09-11T05:41:51  <antimatroid1> yes that would explain it
2010-09-11T05:41:56  <antimatroid1> i changged to void return types
2010-09-11T05:41:59  <antimatroid1> errr :P
2010-09-11T05:42:12  <antimatroid1> i just rewrote planet wars, i hope that is my only issue :P
2010-09-11T05:43:05  <antimatroid1> hmmm, no that was a different function that was void, poop
2010-09-11T05:43:32  <antimatroid1> vikhyat: it's directly after where I called the function that I can't output anything
2010-09-11T05:44:52  <vikhyat> hmm...
2010-09-11T05:45:37  <McLeopold> anybody up on the rules for multiple fleets?
2010-09-11T05:46:12  <McLeopold> It looks like the tcp server will combine 2 orders if they come from the same source to the same dest and the same time.
2010-09-11T05:46:23  <vikhyat> antimatroid1: the function might be doing something to your program flow
2010-09-11T05:46:47  <Palmik> McLeopold, it does
2010-09-11T05:46:55  <Palmik> combine indeed

2010-09-11T05:47:02  <antimatroid1> it's happening from passgamestate in planetwars :|
2010-09-11T05:47:08  <danielvf> Working on the website
2010-09-11T05:47:12  <McLeopold> Is that for the official server as well?
2010-09-11T05:47:42  <McLeopold> I was hoping I could mess up lazy programmers. :)
2010-09-11T05:48:17  <greghaynes> What was the link for that tcp contest host?

2010-09-11T05:48:47  <Palmik> McLeopold, it would be against the rules imo, if you do taht
2010-09-11T05:49:07  <Palmik> if it combines it, you are fine though
2010-09-11T05:49:32  <phreeza> morning danielvf

2010-09-11T05:50:05  <Palmik> would be sweet if the tcp server would tell you why the order is invalid :)
2010-09-11T05:50:17  <greghaynes> Very sad

2010-09-11T05:50:34  <McLeopold> I'm sure it does.  I was accidentally sending it console logging with dates.
2010-09-11T05:50:40  <Appleman1234> just to clarify something
2010-09-11T05:50:47  <Appleman1234> you can issue multiple orders a turn
2010-09-11T05:50:49  <McLeopold> It still played my games, but it sure did complain alot.
2010-09-11T05:51:02  <Palmik> McLeopold, it reports in format You issued an invalid order: src 2, dst 19, ships 1

2010-09-11T06:24:24  <antimatroid1> www.reddit.com/r/math, /r/compsci, /r/askreddit, /r/programming, go have a read ;)

2010-09-11T06:25:03  <vikhyat> phreeza: thanks!
2010-09-11T06:25:53  <Edgeworth> How do we find where our bot is ranked? (-- do we have to just ctrl-f on all ranking pages?)
2010-09-11T06:27:19  <greghaynes> Not anymore, no
2010-09-11T06:27:30  <Zaphus> ok r/math  etc  is pretty cool   might have to pay more attention'
2010-09-11T06:27:41  <antimatroid1> Edgeworth: does it say on your profile?
2010-09-11T06:27:50  <antimatroid1> or write a better bot :P
2010-09-11T06:27:56  <Edgeworth> antimatroid1: It says 'profile temporarily disabled'
2010-09-11T06:28:26  <Edgeworth> antimatroid1: Oh wait,
2010-09-11T06:28:37  <Edgeworth> antimatroid1: Now it says 'lost connection to mysql server' :)
2010-09-11T06:28:50  <Appleman1234> hmm , strategies and decisions
2010-09-11T06:29:04  <danielvf> Edgeworth: now it's back to profile disabled. :P
2010-09-11T06:29:04  <antimatroid1> i think i've made most of my big decisions
2010-09-11T06:29:13  <antimatroid1> it's a matter of implementing and working out the dirty details
2010-09-11T06:29:35  <antimatroid1> my DoTurn function is still empty :|
2010-09-11T06:29:44  <phreeza> danielvf: so rankings are gone too now? :D
2010-09-11T06:30:11  <Appleman1234> mine is currently collecting comments, and once I have my strategies and metastragies sorted out I will start implementing
2010-09-11T06:30:12  <danielvf> No, just restarted mysql. Some non website code hammered it
2010-09-11T06:30:18  <Edgeworth> antimatroid1: I've coded up a bot. It seems to beat the example bots
2010-09-11T06:30:50  <phreeza> Appleman1234: whats a metastragtegy? oO
2010-09-11T06:30:53  <antimatroid1> i don't construct the god damn planets/fleets and planet wars objects every god damn turn anymore either
2010-09-11T06:31:22  <Appleman1234> phreeza, a strategy to choose when to use other strategies or combinations of strategies
2010-09-11T06:31:25  <Edgeworth> antimatroid1: Do you think that will impact a lot on the time?
2010-09-11T06:31:25  <antimatroid1> and no more getter/setter methods, communist programming <3
2010-09-11T06:31:41  <antimatroid1> Edgeworth, not really, but it's also made everything a lot simpler for me
2010-09-11T06:32:00  <antimatroid1> it was a bit of a fuckaround changing up all of planetwars and the main function in mybot
2010-09-11T06:32:11  <Appleman1234> I learnt my lesson last year, with my quick hacked up solution having less planning and my c++ rewrite having less bugs but peforming worse
2010-09-11T06:32:18  <antimatroid1> and i haven't looked at how long construction takes with fuckloads of fleets
2010-09-11T06:32:37  <antimatroid1> i learnt my lesson last year, I am being maticulous about not timing out
2010-09-11T06:32:42  <antimatroid1> well this year*
2010-09-11T06:32:49  <Edgeworth> antimatroid1: New plan: Make thousands of fleets. Timeout those who use the starter packages
2010-09-11T06:33:03  <antimatroid1> Edgeworth: I think the game engine now merges them
2010-09-11T06:33:12  <antimatroid1> but you still have quite a few in motion
2010-09-11T06:33:18  <antimatroid1> i only need to worry about processing new ones now
2010-09-11T06:33:31  <antimatroid1> you sitll have to read it from the game state string though
2010-09-11T06:33:43  <Appleman1234> it wouldn't be hard to implement timer code
2010-09-11T06:34:06  <Appleman1234> or even a stop hammer time condition after you have done truncation of relevant sorted lists / graphs
2010-09-11T06:34:10  <antimatroid1> no, but making sure you don't go too long without checking it is easy apparently
2010-09-11T06:34:25  <Zaphus> timer code is easy.. I have it, but I wonder if I should disable it to find out if I am actually potentially timing out or not - can't tell if you dont let it happen
2010-09-11T06:34:39  <antimatroid1> I debug how long each turn takes
2010-09-11T06:34:46  <antimatroid1> as well as set up, update times etc.
2010-09-11T06:35:02  <antimatroid1> all goes into one file showing whatever I want each turn
2010-09-11T06:35:04  <antimatroid1> works quite well
2010-09-11T06:35:07  <Zaphus> how do you do that on the target hardware?  we get no info back
2010-09-11T06:35:18  <antimatroid1> you don't
2010-09-11T06:35:23  <antimatroid1> although you run your bot locally on tcp server
2010-09-11T06:35:37  <Zaphus> so you don't really know if you have twice as much time, or half, on the real server
2010-09-11T06:35:45  <antimatroid1> nope
2010-09-11T06:35:47  <Zaphus> cycles, not time
2010-09-11T06:36:01  <antimatroid1> i try to optimise strategy
2010-09-11T06:36:15  <antimatroid1> and just figure everyone gets fair number of cpu cycles on the server
2010-09-11T06:36:16  <Zaphus> does the server still let fleets of 0 through ?
2010-09-11T06:36:21  <antimatroid1> not sure
2010-09-11T06:36:30  <antimatroid1> there was a simple proposed fix
2010-09-11T06:36:41  <antimatroid1> as in < == <= 0 for an illegal move or whaever
2010-09-11T06:36:47  <Zaphus> I've been using those for debugging - sending fleets of 0 to planets I wanted to avoid, then I can see it in the replay :-)
2010-09-11T06:37:31  <evgenius> nice trick)
2010-09-11T06:39:32  <phreeza> is anyone trying global optimization yet?
2010-09-11T06:39:35  <Edgeworth> What port should I connect to for http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/
2010-09-11T06:39:38  <phreeza> or thinks it can be done?
2010-09-11T06:39:47  <antimatroid1> global optimization?
2010-09-11T06:39:53  <Palmik> Edgeworth, it's 9999
2010-09-11T06:39:59  <Palmik> and it's in the comments
2010-09-11T06:39:59  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure I have a decent heristic at least
2010-09-11T06:40:01  <Edgeworth> Palmik: Thanks.
2010-09-11T06:40:06  <antimatroid1> i think searching is mostly out
2010-09-11T06:40:08  <Palmik> np
2010-09-11T06:40:14  <phreeza> antimatroid1 ya some form of actually searching the decision tree
2010-09-11T06:40:29  <phreeza> instead of just making decisions on the spot
2010-09-11T06:40:38  <antimatroid1> i can't seem to reduce the number of strategies enough while thinking i'll still get reasonable results
2010-09-11T06:40:40  <phreeza> based on some heuristic
2010-09-11T06:40:52  <antimatroid1> that is not to say I don't completely ignore the future
2010-09-11T06:41:08  <phreeza> yea theres so many choices...
2010-09-11T06:41:16  <antimatroid1> yep, that's what I like most aobut it
2010-09-11T06:41:27  <antimatroid1> and should be lots of competitors
2010-09-11T06:41:40  <phreeza> yea it makes it more diverse i guess
2010-09-11T06:41:48  <phreeza> there will be a lot of strategies
2010-09-11T06:41:53  <Zaphus> theres a bit of Rock-Paper-Scissors about it, most strategies have a weakness.

2010-09-11T06:43:32  <Appleman1234> phreeza, I haven't tried it yet, and will probably do some of it using dp and various state based behaviours in a similar style to my tron bot last year

2010-09-11T06:45:26  <phreeza> ah i wonder if state is neccesary/desirable here

2010-09-11T07:38:45  <Racko> javagamer_Cpp: well ... either way: as printing the result with %ld prints a pretty (and correct) 64bit integer I guess size_t is big enough for both v.x and v.y so that your hash function doesn't have to do anything but put them next to each other in the size_t result. Better use << 32 and || rather than multiplicationand addition though.

2010-09-11T07:52:54  <Racko> to hash a long to an int you would use (int)(this.longValue()^(this.longValue()>>>32))
2010-09-11T07:53:16  <javagamer_Cpp> I mean, rather than using a point as my key I could just convert it to a long first and use that

2010-09-11T07:57:05  <javagamer_Cpp> I'm still trying to organize all my data as efficiently as I can, my strategy is just a slightly modified version of the starter pack
2010-09-11T07:57:20  <s_denchev> does someone have decent code for testing Mybot versus exaplmebots on windows ?
2010-09-11T07:58:10  <Obeleh> just a batch script
2010-09-11T07:59:00  <Obeleh> All I did was put a compile line in it first then remove my old log file and then play one round
2010-09-11T07:59:55  <s_denchev> I am trying to made a batch to play on all maps vs all example bots but I don`t know how to parse results well :(
2010-09-11T07:59:56  <phreeza> i'm looking forward to seeing the first haskell bots :) are there any playing on the tcp server yet?

2010-09-11T08:02:10  <danielvf> phreeza: I don't know how the elo scores work
2010-09-11T08:03:04  <phreeza> but theres no cutoff or anything? 339 contestants at the moment?
2010-09-11T08:03:19  <danielvf> phreeza: I think the ranking shows everyone who submitted a bot, and the bot has played games
2010-09-11T08:03:30  <phreeza> aha
2010-09-11T08:05:12  <phreeza> maybe the ones with no games yet are counted as -9999 and thats why the elo scores are so high
2010-09-11T08:05:30  <danielvf> phreeza: they boosted the elo scores yesterday
2010-09-11T08:05:36  * danielvf afk for mo

2010-09-11T08:05:55  <phreeza> ah ok :) psychological reasons?
2010-09-11T08:05:58  <antimatroid1> yep :P
2010-09-11T08:06:17  <antimatroid1> i figured it'd be better for the new comers and people who aren't as great at programming
2010-09-11T08:06:17  <phreeza> by how much?
2010-09-11T08:06:27  <antimatroid1> no idea, too much in the end

2010-09-11T08:14:33  <phreeza> ah found it, nvm
2010-09-11T08:14:42  <phreeza> its 2000

2010-09-11T08:16:18  <PurplePanda> a good thing would be to add the lowest score to everyone. then 0 is always the worst

2010-09-11T08:18:54  <javagamer_Cpp> PurplePanda, you mean subtract?
2010-09-11T08:19:04  <phreeza> elo = int(elo) + 2000
2010-09-11T08:19:14  <PurplePanda> well they used to be negative
2010-09-11T08:19:14  <phreeza> thats what i was looking for :) but i found it
2010-09-11T08:19:15  <antimatroid1> Appleman1234: I originally planned to have my code resemble a bot for an isomorphic problem with candy mountains, rainbow attacks, unicorns etc. but it was too confusing, so I got ofer that
2010-09-11T08:19:20  <PurplePanda> so that would be add
2010-09-11T08:19:52  <javagamer_Cpp> Still, subtracting a negative from the same negative will give you zero, adding would just double the lower score ;)
2010-09-11T08:20:13  <antimatroid1> erm
2010-09-11T08:20:16  <PurplePanda> yeah, i mean subtract :P

2010-09-11T08:30:42  <Palmik> I would rather find out why am I sending invalid orders in the first place, but i guess some "send only if valied" function will do for now
2010-09-11T08:31:05  <antimatroid1> i would recommend such a function in your final bot

2010-09-11T09:14:10  <antimatroid1> every planet can reach every other one

2010-09-11T09:14:49  <javagamer_Cpp> The problem is giving each planet a vector or pointers to the other planets though.
2010-09-11T09:14:54  <Palmik> I sort them by distance with no problem, but I guess my method is not optimal
2010-09-11T09:15:12  <antimatroid1> you already have a vector of planets right?
2010-09-11T09:15:13  <Palmik> By distance to some point, that is
2010-09-11T09:15:18  <antimatroid1> just use your index for that index value

2010-09-11T09:19:56  <phreeza> who has ObligatoryShampoo?
2010-09-11T09:21:09  <rwa> not me
2010-09-11T09:21:15  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, if planets is array / vector of Planet it should work if closestPlanets is of appropriate size that is

2010-09-11T09:22:01  <javagamer_Cpp> closestPlanets is a std::vector<Planet *> so it should just resize to fit everything I put in, right?
2010-09-11T09:22:19  <Palmik> you have to use push_back
2010-09-11T09:22:21  <Palmik> afaik
2010-09-11T09:22:25  <javagamer_Cpp> Oh yeah!
2010-09-11T09:24:11  <rwa> is the server running games at the moment?
2010-09-11T09:24:13  <javagamer_Cpp> That should just be copying a pointer right?  b/c it looks like it's copying the object itself (which will result in an infinite loop since the objects will have a reference to themselves)

2010-09-11T09:26:24  <javagamer_Cpp> Alright b/c it's copying the first object fine, then spending forever on the second, so clearly I've messed something up
2010-09-11T09:27:07  <rwa> woohoo, finally won a game against a1k0n
2010-09-11T09:27:14  <javagamer_Cpp> O_O nice!
2010-09-11T09:28:05  <evgenius> how do you see which games you won if profiles are disabled?
2010-09-11T09:28:24  <Palmik> evgenius, he is probably talking about tcpserver
2010-09-11T09:28:43  <td> Would anyone mind helping me get started?
2010-09-11T09:29:03  <rwa> on the tcp server...

2010-09-11T09:29:44  <td> I've downloaded the C# starter package, and i'm trying to test this bot against itself...
2010-09-11T09:29:56  <td> the readme states: The tools directory contains a game engine and visualizer. This is meant     to be used to test your bot. See the relevant tutorials on the website for     information about how to use the tools.

2010-09-11T09:30:52  <Palmik> td, here is the command for running the bot http://ai-contest.com/starting_your_own.php
2010-09-11T09:32:06  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, btw... you loop right now is calculating the size of the vector for each iteratin
2010-09-11T09:32:29  <rwa> except where it says "java MyBot", probably not going to use java to start a C# bot...
2010-09-11T09:32:56  <td> ty rwa
2010-09-11T09:33:12  <javagamer_Cpp> Palmik, I'm only running this code once, but I still probably should set the size once I know how big of a vector I'll be storing in it
2010-09-11T09:33:36  <Palmik> you are running it just once, but for each iteration of the loop the size is calculated gaian
2010-09-11T09:33:44  <Palmik> *again
2010-09-11T09:34:30  <javagamer_Cpp> Oh, I meant something different, thanks for catching that
2010-09-11T09:34:37  <jmcarthur> hey the web site is going fast!
2010-09-11T09:34:37  <javagamer_Cpp> I did it that a few times in my code already
2010-09-11T09:34:43  <jmcarthur> what did you guys do?
2010-09-11T09:35:04  <Palmik> whoever is using shredder, he timed out with me for  the third time
2010-09-11T09:35:13  <jmcarthur> i see profiles are disabled
2010-09-11T09:35:18  <Palmik> jmcarthur, steroids!
2010-09-11T09:35:21  <jmcarthur> were they the big slowdown?
2010-09-11T09:35:55  <JensT1> probably a part of
2010-09-11T09:36:29  <Palmik> how long did it take for your bot to show up on the ladder? :)
2010-09-11T09:37:29  <JensT1> 20-30mins
2010-09-11T09:37:36  <JensT1> before it play's it first match
2010-09-11T09:37:44  <antimatroid1> what is wrong with the c++ starter package?
2010-09-11T09:37:45  <JensT1> but the results are highly unstable
2010-09-11T09:37:48  <antimatroid1> i started off a fresh one earlier
2010-09-11T09:37:51  <JensT1> for the first hour
2010-09-11T09:38:18  <JensT1> could take longer as more people are joining
2010-09-11T09:38:48  <antimatroid1> fyi, once people have had their bots up for a while and you re-upload a new one, you will get lots of games quite fast as the server assigns you higher priority for games to work out your score
2010-09-11T09:38:56  <antimatroid1> only thing atm is everyone is trying to upload
2010-09-11T09:39:10  <Palmik> :)
2010-09-11T09:39:31  <antimatroid1> although having said that, games take longer for this than tron i think

2010-09-11T09:41:11  *** JensT1 <JensT1!~jens@91.182.1.232> has left #aichallenge
2010-09-11T09:42:01  <javagamer_Cpp> Palmik, how did the size function take so long?! That was my problem, apparently the second time I ran that loop it took > 0.99 seconds.  Now that I fixed it, the whole thing is <0.02 seconds
2010-09-11T09:42:03  <javagamer_Cpp> thanks
2010-09-11T09:42:29  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: a lot of bots this time around use hueristics instead of search, so they go surprisingly fast
2010-09-11T09:42:44  <antimatroid1> that's a good point
2010-09-11T09:42:44  <bartwe> its early in the contest
2010-09-11T09:42:55  <jmcarthur> it is
2010-09-11T09:42:55  <bartwe> search will happen soon enough
2010-09-11T09:42:56  <antimatroid1> i still expect a lot less bots to be trying to search
2010-09-11T09:43:08  <antimatroid1> but i still expect to be using a fair chunck
2010-09-11T09:43:08  <jmcarthur> i'm doing... psuedo-search
2010-09-11T09:43:21  <antimatroid1> yeah, try to most the most of what i know
2010-09-11T09:43:30  <jmcarthur> half-assed-search
2010-09-11T09:43:31  <bartwe> search is difficult in this case because the choice space per step is alot wider i guess
2010-09-11T09:43:32  * javagamer_Cpp is still working on organizing all the data
2010-09-11T09:43:42  <jmcarthur> *much* wider
2010-09-11T09:43:56  <jmcarthur> how many planets do most maps have?
2010-09-11T09:43:56  <bartwe> also, waiting i find difficult to model
2010-09-11T09:43:57  <antimatroid1> WAY WIDER
2010-09-11T09:44:06  <antimatroid1> 23
2010-09-11T09:44:18  <antimatroid1> i think i could handle more
2010-09-11T09:44:58  <jmcarthur> so there could be 529 new fleets per turn if there are enough ships and all planets are currently owned
2010-09-11T09:45:11  <jmcarthur> oh, not that many
2010-09-11T09:45:17  <jmcarthur> 506
2010-09-11T09:45:21  <bartwe> geh
2010-09-11T09:45:24  <bartwe> 'only' 506
2010-09-11T09:45:27  <jmcarthur> yeah...
2010-09-11T09:45:42  <antimatroid1> that's fine
2010-09-11T09:45:43  <bartwe> so how many inflight fleets does that make ?
2010-09-11T09:46:43  <bartwe> i guess its possible to bring that down to numplanets*maxnumstepsbetweentwoplanets
2010-09-11T09:47:07  <jmcarthur> my bot doesn't really have a limitation based on that number
2010-09-11T09:47:31  <antimatroid1> bartwe: :)
2010-09-11T09:47:58  <antimatroid1> even better, i don't have planet wars setting up planets and fleet vectors every god damn turn
2010-09-11T09:48:32  <bartwe> reading that into object shouldn't cost much of anything
2010-09-11T09:49:04  <jmcarthur> but being able to retain that information without creating it anew means you can have a running analysis rather than having to start over each turn
2010-09-11T09:49:24  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, dunno :D no problem :)
2010-09-11T09:49:25  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: careful, if planets are distances 1 appart, moves happen before you see it
2010-09-11T09:49:56  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: dangit i thought of that but the reasoning in my head told me that i would still see the fleet...
2010-09-11T09:50:04  <antimatroid1> you wont
2010-09-11T09:50:09  <jmcarthur> dangit dangit dangit
2010-09-11T09:50:18  <antimatroid1> that's why i rewrote the entire planet wars thing
2010-09-11T09:50:31  <jmcarthur> why couldn't the engine just send diffs? why does it have to recreate the world? so annoying
2010-09-11T09:50:46  <jmcarthur> yeah i'm rewriting it anyway
2010-09-11T09:50:51  <jmcarthur> but the protocol still works that way
2010-09-11T09:50:59  <antimatroid1> then in that instance it's not too  hard to account for
2010-09-11T09:51:00  <jmcarthur> so its equivalent to adding another wrapper to an existing starter anyway
2010-09-11T09:51:18  <antimatroid1> otherwise it was a nightmare
2010-09-11T09:51:19  <Scrap> I have updated my bot longtime ago. it's not in the ratings yet..
2010-09-11T09:51:42  <rwa> number of rated bots is steadily dropping...

2010-09-11T09:53:18  <Palmik> when you time out, you are removed from the ladder?

2010-09-11T09:53:24  <jmcarthur> Palmik: yeah
2010-09-11T09:53:26  <Palmik> I thought you would just lose a game

2010-09-11T09:53:59  <rwa> has the reason for that rule been explained?  it's terribad
2010-09-11T09:54:05  <Scrap> how do I know if my bot has been disqualified?
2010-09-11T09:54:06  <antimatroid1> i think dc should be reserved for bots suspected/known of cheating
2010-09-11T09:54:24  <antimatroid1> rwa: the reason I was given was that they didn't want bots up there that waste time
2010-09-11T09:54:24  <Palmik> antimatroid1, I see
2010-09-11T09:54:37  <antimatroid1> but in reality they would have shorter games on average if they just time out all the time
2010-09-11T09:54:45  <rwa> exactly
2010-09-11T09:54:50  <antimatroid1> Scrap: once profiles are working again it will say there
2010-09-11T09:55:28  <jmcarthur> to play the other side, i do think it's annoying to have a lot of your wins be timeouts and errors on your opponents' parts
2010-09-11T09:55:28  <antimatroid1> I didn't even know time out resulted in dc till it happened during the last comp
2010-09-11T09:55:35  <antimatroid1> i had always expected it to be a lost game
2010-09-11T09:55:55  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: at least allow a few timeouts before kicking them
2010-09-11T09:56:09  <antimatroid1> mine was the first in hundreds and hundreds of other games
2010-09-11T09:56:39  <rwa> what's annoying about that?  I'll take a win any way my opponent wants to give it to me
2010-09-11T09:57:02  <antimatroid1> it's not fun and everyone else got that win, so you're no better off

2010-09-11T10:00:37  <rwa> some bots seem to use a very similar strategy to mine - we get into pretty symmetric stalemates
2010-09-11T10:01:14  <phreeza> rwa: can you post a link? i haven't seen a real stalemate so far i think
2010-09-11T10:01:29  <javagamer_Cpp> I have sort(closestPlanets.begin(), closestPlanets.end(), this->sortByDistance); where the object which contains this code has a function called sortByDistance I want this sort to use.  The function is dependent on variables specific to the instance of the class.
2010-09-11T10:01:36  <jmcarthur> i've given the patch to use the canvas viz a positive score, but i have reservations since it rules out IE users and i don't know how many IE users we have
2010-09-11T10:02:08  <RobotCaleb> How long does the contest run?
2010-09-11T10:02:08  <antimatroid1> there were some cool stalemates the other day where both bots were simultaneously sending the same amounts to a planet
2010-09-11T10:02:14  <antimatroid1> once with 4 planets doing this
2010-09-11T10:02:23  <antimatroid1> 20 november entries close

2010-09-11T10:03:32  <antimatroid1> does the game engine merge fleets with the same start time, source and destination yet?

2010-09-11T10:08:40  <phreeza> I love some of the names on the tcp server
2010-09-11T10:08:46  <phreeza> OminousBirthdayCake
2010-09-11T10:08:59  <rwa> yeah
2010-09-11T10:09:07  <rwa> probably cousin to ObligatoryShampoo
2010-09-11T10:09:20  <rwa> I can relate
2010-09-11T10:09:50  <rwa> antimatroid1:  because it's early or for some other reason?
2010-09-11T10:10:29  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: issue 112 if you want to track it
2010-09-11T10:10:35  <antimatroid1> because it's early and people haven't had time to really implement anything yet
2010-09-11T10:10:42  <rwa> yeah, me either
2010-09-11T10:10:57  <td> Scrap: how are you compiling the java one... javac *.java ?
2010-09-11T10:11:05  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: got it, thanks
2010-09-11T10:11:12  <Scrap> td: yes sure

2010-09-11T10:11:35  <Scrap> td: what does it say?
2010-09-11T10:11:36  <rwa> wtfbbq is pretty funny, too
2010-09-11T10:11:47  <td> not recognized command

2010-09-11T10:12:18  <evgenius> what timezone does the server reside in?
2010-09-11T10:12:24  <antimatroid1> canada
2010-09-11T10:12:26  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, I can send you my distance sorting functor if you wish
2010-09-11T10:12:32  <rwa> the canada timezone
2010-09-11T10:12:41  <rwa> ;)
2010-09-11T10:12:45  <antimatroid1> :D
2010-09-11T10:12:57  <javagamer_Cpp> Palmik, I want to get it working w/ the normal sort code, it seems my only problem is getting it to accept my function
2010-09-11T10:12:58  <jmcarthur> i think the server is running on GMT though
2010-09-11T10:13:00  <evgenius> can you show up the current time somewhere on the site?
2010-09-11T10:13:02  <jmcarthur> despite its location
2010-09-11T10:13:09  <jmcarthur> i heard that, anyway
2010-09-11T10:13:20  <Palmik> jmcarthur, I!m using normal sort code :D
2010-09-11T10:13:35  <jmcarthur> Palmik: wrong nick ;)
2010-09-11T10:13:35  <rwa> last night it was determined they were running the server on Voyager 2
2010-09-11T10:13:53  <antimatroid1> i was lazy and just used a priority queue for finding closest neighbours aha
2010-09-11T10:13:57  <jmcarthur> rwa: oh, so it's just relativistic effects making it appear to go slow
2010-09-11T10:14:06  <Palmik> jmcarthur, sorry :D
2010-09-11T10:14:13  <rwa> long round trip time, too
2010-09-11T10:14:33  <jmcarthur> rwa: sure, if you want to state the more obvious explanation :P
2010-09-11T10:15:18  <Obeleh> Profiles are starting to work again :D
2010-09-11T10:15:27  <jmcarthur> starting?
2010-09-11T10:15:33  <antimatroid1> they are working again :p
2010-09-11T10:15:42  <jmcarthur> they've been up for about 25 minutes :P
2010-09-11T10:15:57  <jmcarthur> oh, less than that
2010-09-11T10:16:00  <jmcarthur> a bit under 20, my bad
2010-09-11T10:16:03  <Obeleh> My bot is supposed to play some matches first before I can see that thats working too
2010-09-11T10:16:27  <Obeleh> When I uploaded my bot the first time it took only 15 mins to get a match
2010-09-11T10:16:52  <rwa> Obeleh: currently over an hour and counting for me
2010-09-11T10:16:52  <antimatroid1> Obeleh: lots of people are uploading their bots, the server is trying to give them all games
2010-09-11T10:16:54  <antimatroid1> takes time
2010-09-11T10:17:07  <Obeleh> I know
2010-09-11T10:17:12  <Obeleh> And I understand ;)
2010-09-11T10:18:35  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, the problem is, that you have the sort function made in way that it sorts objects, but you need it to take pointers to objects as arguments
2010-09-11T10:20:03  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, http://pastebin.com/hetF8Eti might work
2010-09-11T10:20:42  <javagamer_Cpp> Palmik, wow, I feel kind of good b/c I just tried before I saw the pastebin :)
2010-09-11T10:20:48  <javagamer_Cpp> but it still doesn't work :/
2010-09-11T10:21:01  <danielvf> jmcarthur: It doesn't rule out IE users, it falls back to the java applet if canvas is not supported
2010-09-11T10:23:13  <jmcarthur> danielvf: oh? i didn't see that in the patch
2010-09-11T10:23:26  <jmcarthur> oh it was already in there?
2010-09-11T10:23:29  <danielvf> Yeah
2010-09-11T10:23:31  <jmcarthur> maybe that's why
2010-09-11T10:23:34  *** aerique <aerique!~euqirea@aerique.xs4all.nl> has quit IRC (Quit: ...)
2010-09-11T10:23:37  <jmcarthur> i should look more closely
2010-09-11T10:23:39  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, what does the error look like with the modified code?
2010-09-11T10:23:44  <Palmik> *error
2010-09-11T10:24:55  <javagamer_Cpp> Palmik, identical as far as I can tell
2010-09-11T10:26:15  <jmcarthur> danielvf: okay i see. i haven't tested it in IE, but if its already tested than i approve
2010-09-11T10:26:30  <danielvf> test it again, just so we are sure. :D
2010-09-11T10:26:42  <Palmik> Well, I sort like this http://codepad.org/c8ki3lEt and if I was sorting containers of Planet* I would sort like this http://codepad.org/qRltq5oY

2010-09-11T10:28:11  <jmcarthur> Bobng: do that in IE
2010-09-11T10:28:16  <jmcarthur> Bobng: do you see the java applet?
2010-09-11T10:28:18  <bartwe> ha, i fear haskell bots
2010-09-11T10:28:22  <Bobng> eww IE. one sec
2010-09-11T10:28:35  <javagamer_Cpp> Palmik, I guess I can go with something like that
2010-09-11T10:28:40  <bartwe> thats one nice visualizer....
2010-09-11T10:28:42  <javagamer_Cpp> Palmik, thanks for your help
2010-09-11T10:28:47  <jmcarthur> Bobng: ha, i just realized you're completely out of context here :)
2010-09-11T10:28:47  <Bobng> works in chrome
2010-09-11T10:28:56  <Bobng> works in IE
2010-09-11T10:29:02  <jmcarthur> Bobng: we need to make sure that in IE that falls back to the java applet
2010-09-11T10:29:03  <Palmik> javagamer_Cpp, np
2010-09-11T10:29:04  <Bobng> wait
2010-09-11T10:29:05  <Bobng> no
2010-09-11T10:29:23  <Bobng> jmcarthur: it works, but its not very good
2010-09-11T10:29:31  <kirkeby> jmcarthur: Why not use http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/?
2010-09-11T10:29:36  <JensT1> where can I get runtime info about all suported languages?
2010-09-11T10:29:42  <JensT1> like, what version of python you have etc
2010-09-11T10:29:47  <jmcarthur> Bobng: as in it's the ugly java applet? yeah we know :(
2010-09-11T10:29:50  <JensT1> especialy for ruby and perl or go
2010-09-11T10:29:58  <evgenius> canvas visualizer is great, but why blue instead of green? it's hard to distinguish from grey neutral planets
2010-09-11T10:30:11  <Bobng> yeah, the canvas is much nicer. But yeah it works in IE jmcarthur
2010-09-11T10:30:16  <jmcarthur> danielvf: kirkeby brought this up http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/
2010-09-11T10:30:17  <danielvf> kirkeby: Because I've heard it's uber slow
2010-09-11T10:30:18  <kirkeby> evgenius: I know colorblind people why disagree with you on that.
2010-09-11T10:30:19  <jmcarthur> danielvf: have we tried that
2010-09-11T10:30:21  <jmcarthur> oh
2010-09-11T10:30:24  <Bobng> one small bug though
2010-09-11T10:30:31  <kirkeby> danielvf: Have you ever used Java? Nothing is as slow as an applet.
2010-09-11T10:30:40  <Bobng> it finishes but the play button does not appear again if you rewind the simulation
2010-09-11T10:30:52  <jmcarthur> Bobng: ah that sounds like it's the java applet's fault
2010-09-11T10:30:58  <Bobng> sorry, disregard that
2010-09-11T10:31:04  <Bobng> it just doesn't play when you rewind it.
2010-09-11T10:31:08  <jmcarthur> ah okay
2010-09-11T10:31:09  <danielvf> kirkeby: I think explorer canvas is about 20x slower
2010-09-11T10:31:10  <jmcarthur> Bobng: thanks!
2010-09-11T10:31:17  <Palmik> I guess I!m ok if the java applet does not even load :P
2010-09-11T10:31:21  <Palmik> *I'm
2010-09-11T10:31:23  <jmcarthur> danielvf: we have verification from Bobng that the applet load in IE now at least :)
2010-09-11T10:31:24  <danielvf> Which is okay for drawing something once
2010-09-11T10:31:26  <jmcarthur> *loads
2010-09-11T10:31:28  <danielvf> Okay
2010-09-11T10:31:40  <danielvf> I'll see if I can make it live
2010-09-11T10:31:44  <Bobng> oh no wait, it does play, but the buttons are messed up.
2010-09-11T10:31:45  <kirkeby> danielvf: Oh, well. You're probably right, especially if you've actually tried it :)
2010-09-11T10:31:57  <Bobng> the skip to the start/end buttons are squashed into the corner and only a few pixels wide
2010-09-11T10:32:00  <jmcarthur> Bobng: the ones on the left and right are cut off largely? they do that in mine too
2010-09-11T10:32:06  <Bobng> yeah ^
2010-09-11T10:32:10  <rwa> anybody on the board that submitted in the last few hours?
2010-09-11T10:32:11  <jmcarthur> Bobng: that's the same situation that we already have publicly though
2010-09-11T10:32:17  <jmcarthur> Bobng: so this is now worse at least :)
2010-09-11T10:32:20  <jmcarthur> *no worse
2010-09-11T10:32:42  <jmcarthur> at least now *most* users won't see that
2010-09-11T10:33:07  <jmcarthur> Bobng: currently we just have this http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4435964 for *all* browsers :(
2010-09-11T10:33:26  <jmcarthur> (that link might suddenly be nicer if danielvf gets it integrated before you click it)
2010-09-11T10:33:29  <Bobng> eww
2010-09-11T10:33:31  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-11T10:33:48  <Bobng> can I make one comment about the contest?
2010-09-11T10:33:51  <Bobng> or rather about the site
2010-09-11T10:33:55  <jmcarthur> Bobng: thanks for your help. you accelerated the integration of the improved visualizer :)
2010-09-11T10:34:00  <jmcarthur> sure, please, any feedback
2010-09-11T10:34:07  <danielvf> going afk again
2010-09-11T10:34:30  <Bobng> well i'm a new user and this contest looks cool, it should focus my python skills into something constructive
2010-09-11T10:34:38  <Bobng> but I can't find any info on the game mechanics
2010-09-11T10:35:00  <jmcarthur> yeah we need a spec. there are a few informal things hanging around. let me find some stuff for you
2010-09-11T10:35:21  <Bobng> for example I don't know the rate at which planets create extra points
2010-09-11T10:35:39  <Bobng> just stuff like that. its no big deal
2010-09-11T10:36:31  <jmcarthur> Bobng: this isn't actually a spec of the engine at all, but it can give you some idea of what's happening http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/PlanetWarsFileFormats
2010-09-11T10:36:42  <jmcarthur> Bobng: i'll file a ticket to make a specification for the game though
2010-09-11T10:36:48  <jmcarthur> i think it's important
2010-09-11T10:37:07  <jmcarthur> Bobng: you can get some idea of the game by checking out Galcon, by the way
2010-09-11T10:37:22  <jmcarthur> although there are some differences
2010-09-11T10:37:29  <Bobng> just like how the game actually works. I understand it now, but when I first found the site there was no info on how the game actually works - the site seems to focus on how to create a bot and upload it
2010-09-11T10:37:38  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-11T10:37:40  <Bobng> yeah I had a peek at that, and the video helped a lot
2010-09-11T10:37:47  <jmcarthur> i agree 100% with you
2010-09-11T10:37:54  <jmcarthur> mentioned it before, but didn't file a ticket and forgot
2010-09-11T10:38:03  <jmcarthur> i'll do that now
2010-09-11T10:38:23  <phreeza> i'm going to run some games on *much* bigger maps just for fun
2010-09-11T10:38:35  <danielvf> Planets make ships at their growth rate
2010-09-11T10:38:41  <danielvf> so a 5 planet makes 5 per turn
2010-09-11T10:38:44  <Bobng> alright, thanks. When I get back from work I will bash out a bot and have a play
2010-09-11T10:38:48  <jmcarthur> yeah he figured it out, but it took a while
2010-09-11T10:38:49  <danielvf> Go for it.
2010-09-11T10:39:08  <phreeza> because so far my algorithm still scales well with number of planets :) probably won't be like that forever
2010-09-11T10:39:37  <antimatroid1> lol triple j are playing that song from the montake of the guys pretending to kill each other in slow motion
2010-09-11T10:39:45  <antimatroid1> i can't not think of that video when i hear it
2010-09-11T10:39:49  <antimatroid1> montage*
2010-09-11T10:40:32  <phreeza> tripple j?

2010-09-11T10:41:14  <Palmik> radio station?

2010-09-11T10:41:28  <Palmik> :))
2010-09-11T10:41:28  <Obeleh> anyone know what includes I can use  in MSVC instead of these ?  <inet.h> <netinet/in.h>  <sys/socket.h> <unistd.h>
2010-09-11T10:43:40  <Palmik> quick search game be Winsock2.h
2010-09-11T10:43:48  <Palmik> for sys/socket.h
2010-09-11T10:43:57  <Palmik> *gave me...
2010-09-11T10:44:11  <JensT1> oh, profiles work again
2010-09-11T10:44:13  <JensT1> cool
2010-09-11T10:45:08  <antimatroid1> I think we should be grateful we even have a website :P
2010-09-11T10:46:32  <danielvf> JensT1: and fast even
2010-09-11T10:46:42  <JensT1> indeed
2010-09-11T10:46:51  <JensT1> antimatroid1: true true
2010-09-11T10:47:00  <danielvf> Server load average is "1.39"
2010-09-11T10:47:09  <JensT1> how much cpu's?
2010-09-11T10:47:10  <danielvf> Not bad for a multi core box

2010-09-11T11:00:31  <evgenius> canvas visualizer gives a JavaScript exception for me
2010-09-11T11:00:59  <JensT1> what's the rationale behind the canvas vs java visualiser?
2010-09-11T11:01:05  <JensT1> the java visualiser worked way faster for me :p
2010-09-11T11:01:06  <evgenius> and buttons don't work
2010-09-11T11:01:19  <jmcarthur> evgenius: you mean java?
2010-09-11T11:01:22  <jmcarthur> evgenius: canvas is javascript
2010-09-11T11:01:31  <jmcarthur> JensT1: it did?
2010-09-11T11:01:33  <jmcarthur> that's amazing
2010-09-11T11:01:51  <JensT1> yeah, it only took like 2% cpu
2010-09-11T11:01:51  <jmcarthur> the canvas one is *drastically* faster and *drastically* nicer than the java one for me
2010-09-11T11:01:59  <JensT1> where the canvas is taking an enitre core
2010-09-11T11:02:05  <Guest77645> try using safari or chrome
2010-09-11T11:02:06  <jmcarthur> weird
2010-09-11T11:02:26  <JensT1> it still takes 100% cpu on chromium, but works faster indeed
2010-09-11T11:02:37  <JensT1> slower in ff
2010-09-11T11:02:39  <danielvf> JensT1: You on old firefox?
2010-09-11T11:02:45  <JensT1> 3.6.9
2010-09-11T11:02:57  <danielvf> It's coded to use 100% ish.
2010-09-11T11:03:07  <danielvf> Just does smother animation up to 30fps
2010-09-11T11:03:08  <JensT1> oh, 3.6.8

2010-09-11T11:04:05  <JensT1> it had less frames/sec probably, but that's what it was made like

2010-09-11T11:33:37  <JensT1> danielvf: oh, could be more

2010-09-11T11:36:06  <gilaniali> What are the possible maximum and minimum values for Distance, GrowthRate and total_trip_length?
2010-09-11T11:36:39  <JensT1> distance 0-sqrt(1000^2*1000^2)
2010-09-11T11:36:43  <JensT1> growthrate 0-5
2010-09-11T11:36:55  <JensT1> total trip length about the same as distance I think?
2010-09-11T11:37:11  <antimatroid1> max growth of 5 is boring
2010-09-11T11:37:48  <bartwe> hardly matters
2010-09-11T11:38:08  <bartwe> with a too high rate it gets a boring game of 'highest growth rate wins'
2010-09-11T11:38:22  <Palmik> yeah, I go for planets with 0 growthrate, they are cool

2010-09-11T11:39:05  <Palmik> aren't they? :P
2010-09-11T11:39:05  <JensT1> in my random created maps I have a map with a neutral planet growthrate of 0 and 180troops in the middle
2010-09-11T11:39:14  <JensT1> it gets ignored by all bots :(
2010-09-11T11:39:27  <bartwe> inverse proportional would be somethign too

2010-09-11T11:50:13  <jmcarthur> that's pretty long, actually

2010-09-11T11:51:58  <JensT1>  math.sqrt(24**2 + 24**2)

2010-09-11T11:53:14  <td> is there a way to detect the destination of enemy ships?
2010-09-11T11:53:18  <JensT1> depends on what distance function you choose
2010-09-11T11:53:20  <jmcarthur> nice
2010-09-11T11:53:35  <JensT1> but ingame it's the euclidian distance
2010-09-11T11:53:35  <phreeza> td: yes
2010-09-11T11:53:45  <Palmik> td, yes... in starters it's something like fleetObject.destinationPlanet
2010-09-11T11:53:48  <JensT1> the creator can use a taximetric if it chooses to :p
2010-09-11T11:54:06  <jmcarthur> i was thinking that circular maps might be nice, as opposed to rectangular
2010-09-11T11:54:06  <td> ok.. thanks
2010-09-11T11:54:27  <td> getting a bit confused with all this stuff... so a "fleet" is the number when it's travelling towards a planet, right?
2010-09-11T11:54:41  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-11T11:54:49  <jmcarthur> the number is the number of ships in the fleet

2010-09-11T11:55:55  <Cyndre> is everything working today?
2010-09-11T11:56:10  <jmcarthur> anyway, the max possible distance in a single flight is 34, so a single ship would have time to make that trip 5 times (one way) and then have 30 turns left. that's not many
2010-09-11T11:56:27  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: "everything" is a strong word
2010-09-11T11:56:37  <jmcarthur> many things are working today that were not working yesterday though :)

2010-09-11T11:57:22  <coventry`> Just want to check my reading of engine.py: In a given round, the 1s durations of computation allowed to both players occur concurrently based on the same board state, correct?  It's not player1 moves, then player2 moves in response, etc...
2010-09-11T11:57:23  <JensT1> jmcarthur: a planet has radius of at least 1 I think, so it could make the trip 6 times?
2010-09-11T11:57:38  <jmcarthur> JensT1: the radius of the planet matters?
2010-09-11T11:57:38  <JensT1> oh, no, it's 0
2010-09-11T11:57:42  <jmcarthur> i thought it was center to center
2010-09-11T11:57:44  <JensT1> for the growthrate
2010-09-11T11:58:04  <jmcarthur> yeah, but not for travel time
2010-09-11T11:58:37  <JensT1> jmcarthur: yeah, but like on turn 0 you already see fleets at distance 0 of the planet
2010-09-11T11:58:48  <JensT1> distance1 from the planet*
2010-09-11T11:58:54  <jmcarthur> umm
2010-09-11T11:59:17  <jmcarthur> there shouldn't be any fleets on the move on turn 0 should there be?
2010-09-11T12:00:01  <JensT1> oh yes, the old visualiser starts at turn 1
2010-09-11T12:00:07  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-11T12:00:32  <jmcarthur> coventry`: correct

2010-09-11T12:01:41  <bartwe> it has a big influence on possible endgame tactics
2010-09-11T12:01:42  <jmcarthur> bartwe: but it can change for now

2010-09-11T13:15:36  <j3camero> danielvf: we are not using the VM-based sandboxing anymore. All the untrusted code is run as jailuser1, jailuser2, jailuser3, etc... These users are created by the script planet_wars/backend/create_jail_users.py and have very few priviledges.
2010-09-11T13:15:50  <a1k0n> we could drop all these individual keys

2010-09-11T13:17:08  <j3camero> a1k0n: you probably can do fork right now. But the user that's running your4 code has a very low process limit. After a short while, it will stop giving you new processes.
2010-09-11T13:17:23  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-09-11T13:17:31  <a1k0n> ah, so you're using limit
2010-09-11T13:17:39  <a1k0n> weren't you using ptrace last time?
2010-09-11T13:17:44  <jmcarthur> so i guess i should just close that kvm ticket i made?
2010-09-11T13:18:01  <j3camero> ptrace and systrace are not being used. The contestants' code is just running on bare metal as a user with very few privileges. Low memory limit, low process limit, no internet access, limited file system access, etc.
2010-09-11T13:18:13  <jmcarthur> eek
2010-09-11T13:18:21  <j3camero> It's scary I know.
2010-09-11T13:18:26  <jmcarthur> i would be hesitant about running arbitrary binaries too then
2010-09-11T13:18:32  <j3camero> Believe it or not, it seems to catch most of the ugly things people can do.
2010-09-11T13:18:35  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-11T13:18:49  <jmcarthur> but.... my last job was in bare metal security, and that sounds no good
2010-09-11T13:19:01  <a1k0n> it can open sockets then too
2010-09-11T13:19:02  <j3camero> It seems fairly resistant to forkbombing, deleting all the files, calling home, etc.
2010-09-11T13:19:18  <a1k0n> or does the jail have an internal ip
2010-09-11T13:19:32  <ulope> j3camero: are you using chroot?
2010-09-11T13:20:06  <j3camero> jmcarthur: security is something we have really struggled with. There is really no good way to sandbox untrusted code on a Linux box... VMs would have been great if qemu didn't suck so much. If someone can get it working for sandboxing propramatically, you would be a god.
2010-09-11T13:20:15  <j3camero> ulope: no chroot.
2010-09-11T13:20:31  <a1k0n> isn't the ptrace solution pretty much ideal?
2010-09-11T13:20:36  <jmcarthur> ptrace would work
2010-09-11T13:20:36  <j3camero> I will be the first to admit that we are shaky on security this time around.
2010-09-11T13:20:44  <jmcarthur> kind of slows things down slightly, but not as much as qemu
2010-09-11T13:20:55  <j3camero> On the wiki I wrote an article on why we abandoned ptrace/systrace.
2010-09-11T13:20:58  <ulope> j3camero: waht were your main paint points with qemu?
2010-09-11T13:21:07  <jmcarthur> if we were using ptrace i would be confidence running arbitrary binaries. if i had known that we weren't i wouldn't have been pushing it
2010-09-11T13:21:12  <jmcarthur> okay i'll read it
2010-09-11T13:21:43  <j3camero> There are some deep issues with security code with ptrace. Namely, it completely breaks Java. That's why Java sucked last time.
2010-09-11T13:22:06  <jmcarthur> it wouldn't break if we could just limit according to cpu time... :\
2010-09-11T13:22:23  <dolphin278> you use physical servers for contest, or some cloud nodes?
2010-09-11T13:22:33  <jmcarthur> just one server, dolphin278
2010-09-11T13:22:34  <ulope> because I have quite a few production servers running on qemu/kvm with no major problems
2010-09-11T13:22:48  <a1k0n> ahhh
2010-09-11T13:22:49  <jmcarthur> ulope: kvm being the key there
2010-09-11T13:22:51  <dolphin278> ouch
2010-09-11T13:22:58  <jmcarthur> ulope: i think j3camero was trying it without kvm
2010-09-11T13:23:18  <ulope> jmcarthur: ahh... yeah i can see how that would suck indeed
2010-09-11T13:23:24  <jmcarthur> if we could use another machine we could try bsd jails. they are very secure
2010-09-11T13:23:31  <jmcarthur> but then that would be changing the build target and everything
2010-09-11T13:23:37  <j3camero> ulope: the model with qemu was to have a saved VM image. When we want to run a bot, we kick off the VM from that saved state (takes a few ms at most), use scp to send the files into the VM, then exec the bot inside the vm using the ssh command from the host. This allows the engine (running on the host) to communicate with the bot (running on the guest) through its stdin/stdout channels.
2010-09-11T13:23:45  <jmcarthur> well, not necessarily. freebsd has linux binary compatibilty

2010-09-11T13:25:15  <j3camero> ulope: I did build this up, and it worked okay. It was slow (no kvm due to Ubuntu). The latest problem I was having was that when I kicked off the VM from a saved state, I could not SSH into it. For some reason saving the state then loading the state back would break its connectivity.

2010-09-11T13:27:21  <ulope> j3camero: Hm another reason to upgrade to a recent ubuntu release then. In 10.4 kvm is quite pleasant to setup and use
2010-09-11T13:27:30  <j3camero> ulope: if you're interested in security, I encourage you to produce a proof of concept of a sandboxing method that scales up well, and show it to everyone. We still don't have a truly satisfying answer for sandboxing. We're going to need it though.

2010-09-11T13:29:59  <a1k0n> :|
2010-09-11T13:30:18  <j3camero> ulope: one thing that will help a lot is getting rid of our current engine/bot communication model. Ideally, the engine and bot would talk through TCP.
2010-09-11T13:30:20  <phreeza_mobile> A1k0n resubmitted?
2010-09-11T13:30:23  <dolphin278> i am wondering - can contest be spreaded around several machines? maybe we can just move it to cloud?
2010-09-11T13:30:23  <a1k0n> yep
2010-09-11T13:30:28  <a1k0n> and games aren't running.  haha.
2010-09-11T13:30:36  <phreeza_mobile> Hehe
2010-09-11T13:30:38  <a1k0n> i changed one number which improves my bot on benzedrine.cx
2010-09-11T13:31:01  <j3camero> dolphin278: we want to do this. Want to help build it? It would be great to start doing this.
2010-09-11T13:31:05  <phreeza_mobile> Yea i saw that
2010-09-11T13:31:35  <ulope> j3camero: I was wondering about that. Was this sdin/out model just born out of the qemu necessities?
2010-09-11T13:31:39  <dolphin278> ok, i'll try, and get back if i would have some working stuff.
2010-09-11T13:32:16  <j3camero> I think it would be cool to have many worhorse servers that just run bots. The engine would run on one server, and accept TCP connections from bots running on all the child servers. That way we could scale massively, and we would get so many games per minute.
2010-09-11T13:32:52  <a1k0n> do you have the machines to scale like that?  it wouldn't be hard to implement at all if everything comes through mysql
2010-09-11T13:33:01  <j3camero> ulope: nope, the stdin/stdout communication model was just a carryover from the first ever contests that I ran. It was inspired by the way that chess engines work, with programs like winboard.
2010-09-11T13:33:22  <amstan> j3camero: do you still intend to use that server for general bot running?
2010-09-11T13:33:23  <j3camero> a1k0n: we don't have the machines right at the moment, but we could get them pretty fast.
2010-09-11T13:33:39  <Palmik> with google sticker :D
2010-09-11T13:33:46  <amstan> j3camero: seriously: ai-contest.com server: http://pastebin.com/E4Zjdcs3 , hypertriangle.com surplus sale server($30) http://pastebin.com/kEucBPTX
2010-09-11T13:33:46  <phreeza_mobile> I think youd need more than one instance of the engine though
2010-09-11T13:34:22  <j3camero> phreeza_mobile: sure. But the current bottleneck is definitely finding more CPU for the bots.
2010-09-11T13:34:32  <ulope> j3camero: but would you change the communication method at this point?
2010-09-11T13:34:52  <j3camero> ulope: yes. We would probably do TCP based communication at that point.
2010-09-11T13:35:02  <ulope> j3camero: I mean for the current contest
2010-09-11T13:35:08  <phreeza_mobile> I think benzedrine slows down with 5 games i think but i can run 3 bots with hardly any cpu load
2010-09-11T13:35:21  <phreeza_mobile> -i think
2010-09-11T13:35:59  <dhartmei> it's the internet pipe that is the problem, not the cpu
2010-09-11T13:36:06  <danielvf> FYI: server is playing games again.
2010-09-11T13:36:13  <j3camero> the neat thing about distributing the bots is that we could even use servers at different sites. If someone has an extra server in their basement, it could be used as a remote workhorse node.
2010-09-11T13:36:14  <phreeza_mobile> Woot
2010-09-11T13:36:15  <danielvf> And recording them
2010-09-11T13:36:38  <jmcarthur> j3camero: that possibility is precisely why i think each of those servers should run their own engine
2010-09-11T13:36:40  <a1k0n> j3camero: yeah, but there would have to be a minimum/maximum spec to keep things fair
2010-09-11T13:36:54  <a1k0n> (and yeha they'd have to run their own engines and just send results back)
2010-09-11T13:36:59  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: or find a way to use CPU time, then specs don't matter
2010-09-11T13:37:04  <j3camero> danielvf fixed the engine, I can only assume?
2010-09-11T13:37:08  <zerd> dhartmei: your pipe?
2010-09-11T13:37:09  <a1k0n> (unless you don't trust them, in which case you're just doomed anyway)
2010-09-11T13:37:09  <jmcarthur> well, CPU specs don't
2010-09-11T13:37:24  <danielvf> jail_users table was full of locks
2010-09-11T13:37:47  <phreeza_mobile> J3camero that could be done already with the tcp.c and the benzedrine server,right?
2010-09-11T13:38:13  <j3camero> danielvf: oh of course. It's amazing I didn't think of that. Every few days it fills up, and has to be cleared manually. I am not sure why those locks arent' being released.
2010-09-11T13:38:41  <j3camero> danielvf: there is a script, planet_wars/backend/release_all_jail_users.py. Just run that if this happens again.
2010-09-11T13:38:45  <danielvf> We could put the submissions up on S3

2010-09-11T13:39:14  <danielvf> The master server would have an https api to hand out a game
2010-09-11T13:39:25  <ulope> Even if time measurement was switched to CPU time (and it really should IMHO) different CPUs would still induce a bit of "unfairness"

2010-09-11T13:45:36  <danielvf> is playing a bunch of games roundrobin better at ranking people than playing individual random opponents?
2010-09-11T13:45:47  <j3camero> The message has been removed from the leaderboard. a1k0n, you are good to go! I bet you're pretty pissed about being number 2, huh? :-P
2010-09-11T13:46:36  <danielvf> Hah! I've moved up to #4
2010-09-11T13:46:45  <jmcarthur> the best way to find your rank is to play similarly ranked bots
2010-09-11T13:46:54  <FlagCapper> Are the bots still playing games or has that been halted?
2010-09-11T13:46:55  <jmcarthur> we need the scheduler to encourage that

2010-09-11T13:47:32  <j3camero> danielvf: neither is optimal. We have found the best way to schedule is to play bots against other bots of like strength. So the main server would take bots ranked 60 to 69, send them off to a worker node, which would play them all against one another, then send back the game results. The master would periodically re-rank. This means bots would get a lot of play against bots of like strength, and we would be making best use of bandwidth
2010-09-11T13:47:47  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i like that
2010-09-11T13:47:57  <a1k0n> but i'm not even #2 now that i resubmitted until games start being played
2010-09-11T13:48:05  <danielvf> j3camero: Yes, that sounds best
2010-09-11T13:48:23  <a1k0n> oh i got a game yay
2010-09-11T13:48:31  <jmcarthur> so, are we planning to try something like that for *this* contest, or just for the *next* one?
2010-09-11T13:48:36  <ermau> So what's the deal with games ending as a draw on the first turn?
2010-09-11T13:48:38  <ulope> danielvf, j3camero sorry I'm harping on about this but if the measurememt on the nodes would be measuring cpu time, one ,achine should easily be able to run 10 or more matches at once
2010-09-11T13:48:45  <jmcarthur> ermau: maybe both bots crashed?
2010-09-11T13:48:54  <jmcarthur> or timed out
2010-09-11T13:48:56  <a1k0n> oh hey canvas is the default vis now
2010-09-11T13:49:00  <j3camero> Given that you spend the bandwidth to send a bunch of bots to a worker node, you might as well have the node play as many games as it can (a full roundrobin). This is based on the assumption that bandwidth is more precious than CPU time.
2010-09-11T13:49:18  <jmcarthur> j3camero: so far that has not been the case ;)
2010-09-11T13:49:21  <ermau> jmcarthur: Is there any way to know what map a game was so I can test locally?
2010-09-11T13:49:28  <ermau> jmcarthur: Because I really doubt mine is crashing or timing out
2010-09-11T13:49:34  <airhorns> would you organizers be able to get someone at google to give you free app engine credits?
2010-09-11T13:49:39  <jmcarthur> ermau: replace visualizer in the url with game_info, iirc
2010-09-11T13:49:39  <a1k0n> j3camero: but response time on games is important too and anyway the bandwidth to report 'player A won' is miniscule
2010-09-11T13:49:53  <ulope> airhorns: App engine wont do much good
2010-09-11T13:49:56  <ermau> jmcarthur: Ah thanks
2010-09-11T13:50:01  <danielvf> j3camero: if all games were on amazon ec2, then all servers would be identical, and bandwidth from and to s3 is free
2010-09-11T13:50:27  <ermau> At least the site is speedy today :)
2010-09-11T13:50:29  <jmcarthur> yeah ec2 would be the best for this
2010-09-11T13:50:31  <airhorns> ulope shit i donno what i was thinking nvm
2010-09-11T13:50:55  <j3camero> I ahve looked into EC2. I found it was pretty pricey. If we wanted to spend the money, it would definitely be great. I agree.
2010-09-11T13:51:03  <jmcarthur> pricey? really?
2010-09-11T13:51:14  <jmcarthur> http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing
2010-09-11T13:51:29  <j3camero> Okay I gotta go now. These are all great ideas. I think we should pursue all of them to make the next contest 20X bigger than this one.
2010-09-11T13:51:42  <danielvf> Although playing multiple games with the same bots would work will to even out statistical things before updating the rankings.
2010-09-11T13:51:49  <danielvf> j3camero: laters
2010-09-11T13:51:49  <j3camero> I will be back around 4 PM EST and I will do a bunch of work on stuff.
2010-09-11T13:52:14  <jmcarthur> how many CPU hours do you think we would have to buy from ec2?

2010-09-11T13:58:35  <Palmik> airhorns, what advanced strategy page? :)
2010-09-11T13:58:42  <braddunbar> Palmik: Ah, ok...just so long as i'm not the only one =)
2010-09-11T13:58:48  <airhorns> the issue for it on the google issue tracker, not the page itself

2010-09-11T14:03:53  <bartwe> serious bug in the c# code regarding the parsing of floats
2010-09-11T14:03:58  <jmcarthur> ermau: it's possible that the engine (stupidly) does that if the bots error out. it's hard to tell :\
2010-09-11T14:04:06  <jmcarthur> ermau: could check the source to the engine, i guess
2010-09-11T14:04:08  <bartwe> it should be fixed to a culture that uses '.' as a decimal seperator
2010-09-11T14:05:38  <ulope> Wouldn't it be great if stderr output of the bots was saved and could be viewed from the "my profile" page?

2010-09-11T14:09:49  <AJC> to file?
2010-09-11T14:10:19  <phreeza_mobile> Ajc i redirect stderr to a file
2010-09-11T14:10:41  <AJC> OK, thanks.
2010-09-11T14:10:45  <braddunbar> AJC: I posted an update to PlayGame.jar on the forums that forwards stderr to the console - lemme get the url

2010-09-11T14:12:56  <ulope> AJC: tracebacks oyu mean?
2010-09-11T14:13:12  <AJC> yeah
2010-09-11T14:13:56  <ulope> AJC: yes. If logging is enabled (--logfile on the commadn line) it catches any exception your bot code throws and writes it (including traceback) to the logfile
2010-09-11T14:14:27  <AJC> braddunbar: thanks... I guess it's not official yet.
2010-09-11T14:14:36  <ulope> I'm going to update the repo with an example bot that uses logging

2010-09-11T14:29:36  <jmcarthur> i've begun a draft of the game specification on the wiki. if anybody would like, it's ready for review up to the end of the "The Map" section. i am obviously still working on it below that, and things are still subject to change, but here's an early preview: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/GameSpecification
2010-09-11T14:29:37  <ulope> AJC: Yeah I should probably document that one a bit better. Another way would be: .find_planets(owner=player.EVERYBODY)
2010-09-11T14:29:49  <AJC> ulope: and the distance calculation?
2010-09-11T14:30:15  <ulope> planet1.distance(planet2) or planet1 - planet2
2010-09-11T14:30:34  <AJC> ulope: thanks!
2010-09-11T14:30:36  <dstufft> ulope: you made the unoffical python starter kit didnt you?
2010-09-11T14:30:44  <ulope> dstufft: yes
2010-09-11T14:30:52  <dstufft> ulope: just fyi it doesn't run on windows
2010-09-11T14:30:56  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: might want to clarify that if a player loses all ships in both fleets and planets he loses
2010-09-11T14:30:58  <dstufft> windows doesn't have SIGALRM
2010-09-11T14:31:16  <tapwater> jmcarthur: do you know if was a final decision made about neutral planet battle resolutions?
2010-09-11T14:31:18  <ulope> dstufft: Ah.. ok that for letting me know. Will fix it
2010-09-11T14:31:20  <dstufft> wrapping the signal.signal in  try: except AtrributeError fixed it
2010-09-11T14:31:27  <jmcarthur> tapwater: yes
2010-09-11T14:31:42  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: it currently says "The game may also end earlier if one of the players loses all his ships, in which case the player that has ships remaining wins instantly." but there may be a better way to word it
2010-09-11T14:31:43  <antimatroid1> woah bot count has exploded agian
2010-09-11T14:31:48  <antimatroid1> i am so sick of debugging aha
2010-09-11T14:32:15  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: right.  unfortunately it's before fleets are explained.
2010-09-11T14:32:27  <jmcarthur> tapwater: we have opted for the "all three sides fight at once" method
2010-09-11T14:32:32  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i will be restating it later
2010-09-11T14:32:39  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: that's just the overview section
2010-09-11T14:32:53  <blkperl> any news on ruby being added to the server?
2010-09-11T14:32:53  <antimatroid1> we can assume maps wont start with fleets yeah?
2010-09-11T14:32:58  <ulope> AJC: Another thing that not really documented well: Everything that comes back from find_planets() or find_fleets() is a set, so you can do set "arithmentic" (i.e. intersection and the like) with it
2010-09-11T14:33:02  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: there will be a whole section for endgame conditions
2010-09-11T14:33:13  <a1k0n> yeah fleets are probably not even valid in map files
2010-09-11T14:33:23  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: oh i see, yeah
2010-09-11T14:33:25  <braddunbar> woot!  just won my first game!
2010-09-11T14:33:26  <AJC> ulope: ah, thanks. I'm going for brute force so I just need all planets :-)
2010-09-11T14:33:32  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: fleets are valid in map files according to the spec that j3camero wrote a long time ago
2010-09-11T14:33:33  <AJC> ulope: how about that logging?  how do I set it up?
2010-09-11T14:33:36  <antimatroid1> AJC: good luck with that
2010-09-11T14:33:41  <antimatroid1> you're going to need it
2010-09-11T14:33:43  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: but only because it shares format with state updates
2010-09-11T14:33:47  <AJC> antimatroid1: let's see :-)
2010-09-11T14:33:51  <a1k0n> right-o
2010-09-11T14:33:54  <ulope> AJC: I'm just about to post an update to the repo which will ahve sample code
2010-09-11T14:33:54  <jmcarthur> i may want to mention that
2010-09-11T14:34:00  <tapwater> jmcarthur: ah ok thanks
2010-09-11T14:35:10  <jmcarthur> i will also be adding a nav bar to it
2010-09-11T14:35:23  <jmcarthur> of course that would have to be redone if it's ported over to the main web site
2010-09-11T14:35:31  <jmcarthur> but whatever
2010-09-11T14:35:59  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i may actually remove some of the details from the overview section when i add them to later sections
2010-09-11T14:36:13  <rwa> is there any hope of moving to a distributed system for game evaluation?  Or does existing investment in code make that unlikely?
2010-09-11T14:36:41  <jmcarthur> rwa: we might eventually do that, but i don't know the likelyhood for this particular contest. maybe just a later contest
2010-09-11T14:36:45  <AJC> ulope: cool, let me know!
2010-09-11T14:37:18  <rwa> jmcarthur: thanks.  I am willing to put money towards hardware if it becomes feasible
2010-09-11T14:37:24  <dstufft> rwa imo should probably use something like celery and distribute game evaluation like that
2010-09-11T14:38:07  <dstufft> then adding a new game node is easy
2010-09-11T14:38:14  <dstufft> so is removing

2010-09-11T14:41:14  <jmcarthur> *runs
2010-09-11T14:41:26  <ermau> Ah, it was just weird because I had a rank right after the first game.. and then it went away
2010-09-11T14:41:32  <jmcarthur> oh, that is weird
2010-09-11T14:41:51  <Palmik> nice, I beat some with 4 wins which gave me a lot of rating :)
2010-09-11T14:43:04  <jmcarthur> okay, since it looks like nobody has any more feedback for me, i will continue with the spec now
2010-09-11T14:44:54  <phreeza> i think theres something wrong with the canvas, it stops playing for me on this game http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4436648

2010-09-11T14:52:00  <AJC> ulope: thanks!  I just found the --log parameter and that's working great.
2010-09-11T14:53:09  <ulope> AJC: Hm yeah I should probably fix that. .planets is a dict so you can do for id, planet in self.universe.planets:
2010-09-11T14:53:33  <AJC> ulope: thanks, that's OK if it's documented...
2010-09-11T14:53:36  <ulope> AJC: Ah sorry that should be: for id, planet in self.universe.planets.items()

2010-09-11T14:56:42  <AJC> I have my_planets, looping over it, getting the ids as well.
2010-09-11T14:57:18  <AJC> ulope: I should look it up myself in .planets
2010-09-11T14:57:40  <ulope> AJC: the result from .my_planets should be a set

2010-09-11T15:01:52  <rwa> Zannick: as in the data used to visualize past games.  Data mining that is fair game?
2010-09-11T15:02:53  <Zannick> yeah, i think
2010-09-11T15:03:30  <Zannick> you're not allowed to condition on the name of your opponent, but using old game data to train your bot is okay
2010-09-11T15:03:55  <bartwe> hmz, why is sending a single unit to a neutral planet with no ships not enough to capture it ?
2010-09-11T15:04:20  <Zannick> bartwe: because you need to get a newer version of that jar file
2010-09-11T15:04:23  <dhartmei> to provoke the opponent into taking out the rest of the neutral ships? :)
2010-09-11T15:04:54  <bartwe> Zannick: how new isthe new version ? i down graded because the version of 5 hours ago did not work
2010-09-11T15:05:32  <Zannick> well, the version of 5 hours ago i guess still has problems
2010-09-11T15:05:42  <Zannick> the off-by-one thing was fixed on, like, tuesday
2010-09-11T15:06:01  <bartwe> ehhh

2010-09-11T15:24:13  <jmcarthur> clarification needed: in the map format, are planet IDs numbered from 0 or from 1? the wiki says 0 but it looks to me like the engine actually uses 1?
2010-09-11T15:24:51  <Palmik> yeah... it seems to be 1, not sure though
2010-09-11T15:25:05  <Palmik> I never seen 0 that is and I always start at 1
2010-09-11T15:25:38  <jmcarthur> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/PlanetWarsFileFormats says "Planets are implicitly numbered starting from zero, in the order that they are encountered in the file."

2010-09-11T15:28:03  <Zannick> 0 is always the center planet
2010-09-11T15:28:17  <jmcarthur> ah okay
2010-09-11T15:28:21  <Palmik> *differ
2010-09-11T15:28:21  <jmcarthur> now it makes sense
2010-09-11T15:28:26  <jmcarthur> it starts at0
2010-09-11T15:28:29  <jmcarthur> * at 0
2010-09-11T15:28:37  <Zannick> then 1 and 2 are the starting planets
2010-09-11T15:29:12  <Zannick> and maps are 180-degree rotationally symmetric about the center planet
2010-09-11T15:29:36  <jmcarthur> game spec updated up through the I/O section: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/GameSpecification
2010-09-11T15:29:55  <jmcarthur> still working on that later stuff, and might have to give it a once over to make sure everything in there
2010-09-11T15:30:14  <Palmik> so planets 4 and 5 for example are "clones" of each other?
2010-09-11T15:30:30  <jmcarthur> Palmik: at least in the generator
2010-09-11T15:30:38  <Palmik> nice :)
2010-09-11T15:30:42  <jmcarthur> i'm not assuming anything like that though in case we end up adding some handmade maps
2010-09-11T15:30:50  <Palmik> of course :)
2010-09-11T15:31:06  <Palmik> but that would make copybot cry

2010-09-11T15:31:49  <Zannick> that would make copybot do a lot of silly things

2010-09-11T15:32:20  <Zannick> actually, my copybot wouldn't crash

2010-09-11T16:24:53  <dhartmei> but the official engine doesn't check that condition, either
2010-09-11T16:25:08  <dhartmei> so, maybe drop it, and adjust the problem description page?

2010-09-11T16:27:08  <coventry`> Yes, the problem description page is wrong.  You win if you have more ships than your opponent at round 200.  You don't have to wipe them out or take over all the planets.
2010-09-11T16:27:17  <jmcarthur> dhartmei: you being one who has reimplemented the engine, i'd especially like it if you skimmed over it, if you have the time

2010-09-11T16:39:34  <jmcarthur> np
2010-09-11T16:39:48  <jmcarthur> now i just want to have it reviewed heavily before we declare it canon
2010-09-11T16:40:45  <ulope> jmcarthur: So is 200 going to be THE-NUMBER then? I'm stillhoping for it to be raised
2010-09-11T16:40:46  <jmcarthur> then we can work out what to do with it. i'm thinking we could perhaps integrate it in with Problem Description or something
2010-09-11T16:41:05  <jmcarthur> ulope: i wrote in the spec that it's subject to change but will be hardened later
2010-09-11T16:41:21  <jmcarthur> i should say that everywhere that the number 200 is mentioned though
2010-09-11T16:41:26  <jmcarthur> doing that now
2010-09-11T16:41:51  <bartwe> jmcarther: if two planet occupy the same coordinate, is the totalTipTime then 1 or 0

2010-09-11T16:42:02  <jmcarthur> ulope: oh, i already do that. :)
2010-09-11T16:42:11  <mistabell> now that I've played a bunch, I think 200 isn't too bad
2010-09-11T16:42:24  <jmcarthur> bartwe: two planets should not occupy the same coordinates, i think, but i don't know
2010-09-11T16:42:25  <coventry`> On the tcpserver, games under a given name are aggregated even if the client disconnected from the server in between games, right?
2010-09-11T16:42:38  <jmcarthur> coventry`: should be
2010-09-11T16:42:40  <bartwe> jmcarthur: put it in the spec then :)
2010-09-11T16:42:54  <jmcarthur> bartwe: i'm going to check the source of the map generator first
2010-09-11T16:43:29  <jmcarthur> bartwe: ah, there is a function for making sure planets are not too close
2010-09-11T16:43:34  <jmcarthur> adding to the spec
2010-09-11T16:45:06  <coventry`> Thanks, jmcarthur.  It makes it a little harder to assess a bot's strategies, because it's presumably under development between games.
2010-09-11T16:45:40  <jmcarthur> bartwe: oh, apparently that can happen in the generator
2010-09-11T16:46:02  <ulope> jmcarthur: Maybe you should add a part about planet ids (i.e. will always be send in the same order, numbered from 0 to n...)
2010-09-11T16:46:05  <bartwe> jmcarthur: i think it can then underflow the 'turns remaining'
2010-09-11T16:46:10  <jmcarthur> bartwe: if two planets have zero growth rate that could theoretically be on top of each other and pass that check

2010-09-11T16:48:43  <Zannick> the current map generator, however, makes only symmetric maps
2010-09-11T16:48:56  <Zannick> and only the center planet may have growth 0
2010-09-11T16:49:08  <jmcarthur> Zannick: oh, if that's true then there is no bug
2010-09-11T16:49:29  <Zannick> some might say the bug is allowing that planet to have 0 growth :)
2010-09-11T16:49:36  <jmcarthur> it's just a subtle detail that might creep in later if we modify the generator
2010-09-11T16:49:52  <jmcarthur> i don't think 0 growth is so bad
2010-09-11T16:50:02  <jmcarthur> i suspect that 5 growth may be too high though

2010-09-11T16:50:30  <tapwater> growth in general is crazy fast compared to galcon
2010-09-11T16:51:29  <RobinB> the maximum growth rate doesn't really change the competition-problem though
2010-09-11T16:51:56  <RobinB> except if you hard-code them in your solution, which would be somewhat dumb

2010-09-11T17:02:54  <jmcarthur> wvdschel: yes. i'll try to clarify that. at what point in the document did it occur to you that it didn't say that?
2010-09-11T17:03:19  <wvdschel> jmcarthur, the part where it said how to issue orders
2010-09-11T17:03:19  <jmcarthur> wvdschel: actually, it does say how many turns it takes to get from one planet to another
2010-09-11T17:03:38  <wvdschel> ah right
2010-09-11T17:03:40  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-09-11T17:03:48  <jmcarthur> but i can't find it. maybe i should say it redundantly
2010-09-11T17:03:49  <RobinB> you shouldn't mention the speed, it's implicit
2010-09-11T17:03:55  <jmcarthur> RobinB: right
2010-09-11T17:03:57  <RobinB> also, it's not exactly 1

2010-09-11T17:05:54  <danielvf> I'm going to go away and code for a few

2010-09-11T17:39:31  <coventry`> greghaynes: There are a lot of function calls in that code.  It's one of the drawbacks of the python starter kit.  It appears to have been written by a Java/C++ refugee.
2010-09-11T17:39:52  <coventry`> greghaynes: (Function calls are relatively expensive in python.)
2010-09-11T17:39:58  <jmcarthur> that's sad
2010-09-11T17:40:13  <greghaynes> Yeaa, ive noticed.  Its on my to-do list to fix
2010-09-11T17:40:15  <ermau> coventry`: heh, so does the C# kit

2010-09-11T17:43:48  <deepblue> hehe I think not possible to kill a1k0n faster than that ;)
2010-09-11T17:43:58  <coventry`> deepblue: If you're CPU-constrained, you probably want to test your code on the server itself.  It is probably substantially slower than the hardware you're running on with the tcpserver.
2010-09-11T17:44:10  <deepblue> yeah

2010-09-11T17:48:20  <Naktibalda> multiply by 100
2010-09-11T17:48:28  <deepblue> ^^
2010-09-11T17:48:31  <javagamer_Cpp> Then just cast to ints?

2010-09-11T17:55:19  <javagamer_Cpp> Oh, thanks for the suggestion about my hash table, seems to be working
2010-09-11T17:55:29  <dolphin278> The more improvements in my bot i made, the worse is result... :) Kind of "over-educated".
2010-09-11T17:55:37  <antimatroid1> although it depends what counts as searching

2010-09-11T18:00:25  <antimatroid1> if my profile isn't even recognising me uploading something a while ago, is that because it fucked it up or because it's just not even showing that yet?

2010-09-11T18:25:01  <zaph> Jmcarthur , the rankings look ok. Daniel is in 5th after about 24hrs - hasn't lost a game, that feels believable
2010-09-11T18:25:01  <jmcarthur> dolphin278: are you talking about actually crashing or just doing something invalid
2010-09-11T18:25:40  <ratatata> dolphin278: your ships suddently disappearing is usually not crash but getting dropped if that is the case with you
2010-09-11T18:26:01  <dolphin278> i am talking about games, where i have more that 3/4 of map, and game suddently stops at turn, say 43, and i am lose :)
2010-09-11T18:26:07  <RobinB> if i send two fleets from a to b in the same tick, will they get merged into one on the server?
2010-09-11T18:27:30  <jmcarthur> RobinB: ideally
2010-09-11T18:27:35  <jmcarthur> RobinB: that is a ticket

2010-09-11T18:29:11  <ermau> jmcarthur: Well, the command is "mono bin/Debug/MyBot.exe"
2010-09-11T18:29:37  <jmcarthur> ermau: ah, n/m then
2010-09-11T18:29:40  <dhartmei> make a MyBot.bat script. which contains that line. then run tcp with just "MyBot.bat" as argument
2010-09-11T18:30:18  <ermau> I did that with a bash script already

2010-09-11T18:33:15  <zaph> We really need to show why a game ended. I cannot believe the #1 bot did an illegal move on the first turn, along with his opponent - I have seen other cases of this too.

2010-09-11T18:43:22  <jmcarthur> it requires features from a newer version of ghc

2010-09-11T19:22:55  <Bobng> I ran a pretty cpu intensive site/app once upon a time, and I ran it on quite modest hardware that didn't scale to 400+ users, so I simply loaded up a half decent amazon vps to ease the load. worked pretty well.

2010-09-11T19:24:34  <JensT1> they planed to run each one in their own vm
2010-09-11T19:24:42  <Bobng> haha
2010-09-11T19:24:48  <JensT1> but I think that's to much overhead

2010-09-11T19:25:35  <JensT1> but it uses ssh to connect to each bot, so starting vm's on different machines could scale if you have enought machines
2010-09-11T19:25:52  <dstufft> not that expensive really, you get a VM solution with snapshots, boot up the VM, take a snapshot, deploy submission, compile, run it, get results, rollback, repeat minus the bootup
2010-09-11T19:26:00  <Bobng> whats the github url again?

2010-09-11T19:31:45  <JensT1> jmcarthur: yeah, your users can still read and write outside their own dir?
2010-09-11T19:31:55  <JensT1> you should just perform a chroot command before starting them
2010-09-11T19:31:58  <jmcarthur> JensT1: i doubt that
2010-09-11T19:32:02  <jmcarthur> can they really?
2010-09-11T19:32:07  <JensT1> would make it more secure
2010-09-11T19:32:22  <jmcarthur> yeah chroot would be good, but i wasn't aware that they could do that anyway

2010-09-11T19:44:00  <jmcarthur> does mono even work on the bsds?
2010-09-11T19:44:06  <caytchen> FlagCapper: didn't happen to me yet
2010-09-11T19:44:17  <FlagCapper> k
2010-09-11T19:44:17  <jmcarthur> i think ghc on openbsd is still at version 6.6
2010-09-11T19:44:32  <jmcarthur> basically the situation is even worse than this old version of ubuntu
2010-09-11T19:44:34  <dstufft> mono works on freebsd
2010-09-11T19:44:35  <dwchandler> ghc on open recently got an update
2010-09-11T19:44:40  <dstufft> atleast
2010-09-11T19:44:43  <jmcarthur> dwchandler: to what?
2010-09-11T19:44:48  <FlagCapper> It was working fine for me yesterday and making a move takes almost no time on my machine :(
2010-09-11T19:44:50  <caytchen> FlagCapper: also, i've lost a bunch of games to you with my insanely sophisticated bot.
2010-09-11T19:44:51  <dwchandler> let me check for sure...
2010-09-11T19:45:01  <caytchen> but then it also fails on the example bots /sad
2010-09-11T19:45:22  <dwchandler> jmcarthur: 6.12.3
2010-09-11T19:45:22  <FlagCapper> :(
2010-09-11T19:45:24  *** jaspervdj <jaspervdj!~jaspervdj@zeus.ugent.be> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
2010-09-11T19:45:27  <jmcarthur> dwchandler: nice!
2010-09-11T19:45:39  <dwchandler> yeah, thanks to kili
2010-09-11T19:45:40  <jmcarthur> you're sure that's openbsd, not freebsd?
2010-09-11T19:45:43  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-11T19:46:02  <dwchandler> jmcarthur: http://openports.se/lang/ghc
2010-09-11T19:46:14  <jmcarthur> +1 for openbsd then
2010-09-11T19:46:50  <jmcarthur> dstufft: either way, if we already VM the bots there isn't much reason to use a hardened kernel in the vm
2010-09-11T19:46:57  <dstufft> although you'd still be fine running a linux as a VM too, since the point of  aVM is to isolate so you can blow away anything the bot did anyways
2010-09-11T19:47:00  <dstufft> lol
2010-09-11T19:47:03  <dstufft> great minds
2010-09-11T19:47:54  <dwchandler> is there a way to run wars localy w/out java, or with java 1.5?
2010-09-11T19:47:58  <ulope> If we go for kvm the guest should be using a recent kernel (i.e. ubuntu 10.04) sonce thay support virtio out of the box
2010-09-11T19:50:16  <danielvf> dwchandler: you could modify the official python engine.
2010-09-11T19:50:17  <jmcarthur> ulope: hey, and if we did the compilation on it we could use recent versions of these languages!
2010-09-11T19:50:36  <ulope> jmcarthur: thats the idea :)
2010-09-11T19:51:47  <jmcarthur> of course, then we could just use arbitrary binaries anyway
2010-09-11T19:51:55  <caytchen> next step: start two vms, create some pipe between them to relay the stdout stuff, have windows apps run against linux apps. ultimate profit ;p
2010-09-11T19:52:01  <Bobng> how fast do fleets move?
2010-09-11T19:52:16  <jmcarthur> Bobng: it's not quite like that
2010-09-11T19:52:16  <caytchen> Bobng: one turn a turn i think.
2010-09-11T19:52:16  <danielvf> 1 unit of distance per turn
2010-09-11T19:52:26  <jmcarthur> Bobng: the distance between planets is given in "turns"
2010-09-11T19:52:36  <jmcarthur> Bobng: euclidean distance rounded up
2010-09-11T19:52:39  <Zannick> it takes ceil(distance(a)(b)) turns to travel between a and b
2010-09-11T19:53:18  <dwchandler> aha, I see dhartmei is on it. prolly all I need then :D
2010-09-11T19:53:21  <jmcarthur> Bobng: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/GameSpecification
2010-09-11T19:54:21  <jmcarthur> Bobng: you were the one wanting a spec earlier today right? :)
2010-09-11T19:54:34  <Bobng> yep :)
2010-09-11T19:54:47  <a1k0n> You WIN against copybot
2010-09-11T19:54:51  <Bobng> so its possible to plan a trip to a planet beforehand and work out how many turns until the fleet reaches it?
2010-09-11T19:54:52  <a1k0n> man that rules.  whose is copybot?
2010-09-11T19:55:07  <Zannick> still mine
2010-09-11T19:55:15  <a1k0n> nice work.
2010-09-11T19:55:23  <Zannick> heh
2010-09-11T19:55:27  <Bobng> Oh, I see a distance function -_-
2010-09-11T19:55:28  <Zannick> i haven't touched it since tuesday
2010-09-11T19:55:29  <a1k0n> does it just add the planet's growth before sending a fleet if it's an opponent's planet?
2010-09-11T19:55:34  <jmcarthur> there you go
2010-09-11T19:55:44  <a1k0n> i somehow didn't notice it
2010-09-11T19:55:55  <Zannick> i only got it on tcp today
2010-09-11T19:56:03  <Zannick> and it always adds the growth
2010-09-11T19:56:08  <a1k0n> ah
2010-09-11T19:56:09  <Zannick> so it's not quite a copybot exactly
2010-09-11T19:56:48  <Zannick> hm
2010-09-11T19:56:52  <Zannick> i should remove that
2010-09-11T19:56:55  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~scott@c-76-121-152-123.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-11T19:57:17  <Zannick> cause copybot really fails when it launches multiple fleets from the same planet in one turn
2010-09-11T19:57:49  <a1k0n> you mean cuz it doesn't have enough ships?
2010-09-11T19:57:59  <Zannick> like, it sent 57 to a 60-planet in response to you sending 61 to a 60-planet
2010-09-11T19:58:02  <Zannick> yeah
2010-09-11T19:58:25  <a1k0n> yeah but it'll just be extra-ineffective without that.  dunno.
2010-09-11T19:58:33  <Zannick> except if i do change that, it'll be guaranteed to lose
2010-09-11T19:59:02  <Zannick> well, unless the opponent hits the center for less than its starting ships
2010-09-11T19:59:16  <a1k0n> actually it could work, i mean, if your opponent wipes out all the neutral ships and you arrive one turn later with just as many you're probably going to take it
2010-09-11T19:59:29  <Zannick> er, also for just the center
2010-09-11T19:59:37  <Zannick> hm
2010-09-11T19:59:48  <a1k0n> but my bot will always respond with extra reinforcements on the following turn so it'll just be taking turns adding ships onto the pile
2010-09-11T20:00:45  <a1k0n> oh right, just for the center.  duh.
2010-09-11T20:01:10  <Zannick> well, there are some odd cases
2010-09-11T20:01:22  <a1k0n> have it just not add the extra ships if the target is neutral, and leave everything else alone
2010-09-11T20:01:37  <j3camero> Okay I am back. Time to clear some issues!
2010-09-11T20:01:44  <a1k0n> yey
2010-09-11T20:01:49  <j3camero> I see we have had quite a lot of new contestants joining us.
2010-09-11T20:01:50  <a1k0n> we need more games scheduled *whine*
2010-09-11T20:02:09  <a1k0n> also new starter packs, and please put version numbers on them
2010-09-11T20:02:10  <jmcarthur> we have a spec!
2010-09-11T20:02:22  <Appleman1234> j3camero, welcome back
2010-09-11T20:02:25  <j3camero> Yeah, I want to fix the scheduler so it also plays you against people of like skill. So I am going to basically ignore the IRC channel for a while and not get distracted. I wanna fix these issues.
2010-09-11T20:02:26  <a1k0n> j3camero: so did you want to allow me to commit to trunk?  cuz there are some merges that should go in
2010-09-11T20:02:26  <Zannick> okay, new copybot is running

2010-09-11T20:03:23  <j3camero> a1k0n: yes, go ahead. The new policy is that any committer can approve a code review (except your own), and potentially contentious ones need to be discussed and approved by some sort of consensus.
2010-09-11T20:03:43  <j3camero> a1k0n: yeah I will start with their patch for the scheduler, and get it working right.

2010-09-11T20:05:57  <dstufft> j3camero: are you guys sending email out through gmail?
2010-09-11T20:05:58  <a1k0n> word.  i'm going to once again request that you start putting version numbers on starter packs.
2010-09-11T20:06:24  <a1k0n> people are very confused about the two versions out ther ein the wild already
2010-09-11T20:06:29  <j3camero> a1k0n: how should I do that? Just ascending integers in the file name? Like python_starter_package_1.zip?
2010-09-11T20:06:53  <Zaphus> date and time would be a start !  maybe a revision history text file ?
2010-09-11T20:06:59  <j3camero> dstufft: we were using gmail for outbound mail until yesterday, when we got blacklisted.
2010-09-11T20:07:00  <a1k0n> j3camero: i suggest python_starter_package-1.2.zip, and retroactively calling the last two 1.0 and 1.1.
2010-09-11T20:07:28  <j3camero> a1k0n: cool. Will do.
2010-09-11T20:07:30  <Naktibalda> my latest revision is PhpStarterpackage-1.1.1.zip :)
2010-09-11T20:07:31  <dstufft> j3camero: ah i saw the gmail.py, I was going to say that you know that gmail silently stops sending email if you send out X number of emails per day
2010-09-11T20:07:34  <a1k0n> and also put a blurb on the page saying "Starter packages 1.2 released 10/11/2010; including fixes for x y and z)
2010-09-11T20:07:36  <dstufft> without logging into the web interface
2010-09-11T20:08:33  <sigh> how do users know when there is a start pack update?
2010-09-11T20:08:40  <sigh> *starter
2010-09-11T20:08:51  <a1k0n> right now, they have no idea, leading to the aforementioned confusion
2010-09-11T20:09:01  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-11T20:09:07  <j3camero> Ideally we would just avoid releasing any more shitty starter packages.
2010-09-11T20:09:16  <a1k0n> well, too bad, it's going to happen again.
2010-09-11T20:09:17  <Naktibalda> does it really matters? any bot should be improved a lot
2010-09-11T20:09:34  <a1k0n> Naktibalda: the ShowGame.jar and PlayGame.jar are really the things that are changing
2010-09-11T20:09:39  <j3camero> Okay, I am off to start fixing issues.
2010-09-11T20:09:42  <a1k0n> not the crummy code to start from necessarily
2010-09-11T20:09:44  <Naktibalda> ah, right
2010-09-11T20:09:46  <Zannick> mostly the problems are with the engine and visualizer that are put in the packs
2010-09-11T20:10:08  <a1k0n> also last time a whole bunch of extra maps were put into the starter packs and i had no idea
2010-09-11T20:10:14  <Naktibalda> maybe you should separate them from starting code?
2010-09-11T20:10:43  <a1k0n> Naktibalda: yeah, maybe an 'engine and map pack' or something
2010-09-11T20:12:37  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  new maps ?   when did that happen ?
2010-09-11T20:12:49  <a1k0n> Zaphus: in the tron challenge
2010-09-11T20:12:59  <Zaphus> a1k0n: oh, ok :-)
2010-09-11T20:13:40  <j3camero> a1k0n: haha, I was gonna say.
2010-09-11T20:13:45  <sigh> I think even keeping the engine and maps seperate would be good... engine shouln't be updated often, maps might be
2010-09-11T20:13:50  <a1k0n> i would put it within the realm of possibility that really interesting maps exist somewhere out there in the design space and that it might be a good idea to include them
2010-09-11T20:14:03  <Zeiris> Speaking of maps, assuming there's no successful monte-carlo bots, and variations in turn run times don't end up affecting lookahead depth significantly... Won't that mean game outcomes between two bots are deterministic in the map?
2010-09-11T20:14:38  <Zannick> they mostly are already, perhaps
2010-09-11T20:14:53  <sigh> currently all the games I've played locally are deterministic
2010-09-11T20:14:54  <a1k0n> Zeiris: i dunno, on the closed set of tron maps, the turn run time was the only nondeterministic thing and there was a lot of nondeterministic behavior as a result
2010-09-11T20:14:58  <antimatroid1> j3camero: please please please extend the time for which you're planning to run the final contest for
2010-09-11T20:14:59  <Zeiris> Wouldn't it then be best to have hundreds of slightly different maps?
2010-09-11T20:15:16  <antimatroid1> a week + with a live leaderboard throughout would best imo
2010-09-11T20:15:32  <antimatroid1> Zeiris: you also want to rank the bots

2010-09-11T20:18:03  <Zaphus> Zeris:  the map choice is pretty critical, I hope they are able to run a round robin on all maps for the finals, e.g. map 30 has a completely different strategy to map1  (well, it can have)
2010-09-11T20:18:31  <dstufft> or just run through all 100 maps !
2010-09-11T20:18:47  <canihazbacon> google could sponsor some servers ;-)
2010-09-11T20:18:53  <sigh> map30 is a bit insane
2010-09-11T20:19:08  <Zaphus> Just run the finals over a week, keep the scoreboard updating, it would actually be fun to watch
2010-09-11T20:20:00  <Zannick> round-robin the top n, where every match is all the maps
2010-09-11T20:21:35  <canihazbacon> Zannick: sounds like a good compromise
2010-09-11T20:21:51  <Zeiris> It's fascinating that Python' seems to be doing well.
2010-09-11T20:21:54  <j3camero> a1k0n: can you find a committer (or recommend one) to review and merge some of your changes? Also, can you review and merge some of the other code reviews? Let's make some big improvements today.
2010-09-11T20:21:59  <Zaphus> yeah, wouldnt take too long if n is kept under control   50 players would be 245,000 matches, which wouldnt take as long as it sounds, just a few days
2010-09-11T20:22:09  <j3camero> a1k0n: and fire emails out to the mailing list whenever you need something.
2010-09-11T20:22:30  <a1k0n> sure.  um, which mailing list?
2010-09-11T20:22:34  <dstufft> Zaphus: you could speed it up by running more of them concurrently
2010-09-11T20:22:57  <antimatroid1> +1 for round robin tob x
2010-09-11T20:22:58  <Zaphus> dstufft: indeed, or just let it run over several days because it would be fun to watch as it progresses, not just a final score

2010-09-11T20:23:36  <j3camero> I just got Zaphus' earlier messages about issues 68 and 96. Will take a look at those before starting with the scheduler.
2010-09-11T20:23:46  <Zannick> well, we could have a page with the match results of x vs y in the final tourney
2010-09-11T20:23:49  <sigh> If that was the case, people ca precomute and store strategies
2010-09-11T20:23:49  <jmcarthur> one of them is the scheduler
2010-09-11T20:23:54  <Zannick> j3camero: 68 is the scheduler
2010-09-11T20:23:57  <Zannick> ...and that was me :)
2010-09-11T20:24:49  <Zeiris> Anyone got links to "good" games between good bots?
2010-09-11T20:25:06  <Zeiris> I'm tired of looking for stuff that doesn't involve the default one-at-a-time bots.
2010-09-11T20:25:25  <Zaphus> zeiris: whats the definition of 'good' ?
2010-09-11T20:25:26  <caytchen> Zeiris, just check out benzedrine.cx/planetwars/ hehe
2010-09-11T20:25:45  <Zeiris> Zaphus, where the opponent isn't firing one fleet at a time.
2010-09-11T20:25:52  <a1k0n> j3camero: join requested
2010-09-11T20:25:55  <RobinB> i usually look at the matches where the top bots lose
2010-09-11T20:26:12  <Zaphus> yeah, top bots losing is very interesting to look at
2010-09-11T20:26:28  <Zaphus> found one of mine where I had a clear lead and managed to throw it away through bad choices
2010-09-11T20:26:30  <a1k0n> that formed the basis of my analysis last time
2010-09-11T20:26:42  <sigh> Zaphus: link?
2010-09-11T20:26:45  <ratatata> QuickStart Guide shouldn't encourage people to upload starter packages.. too much clutter, wasted processing power, less games for actual bots etc
2010-09-11T20:26:54  <jmcarthur> ratatata: i agree
2010-09-11T20:27:05  <caytchen> didn't the last challenge "garbage collect" these?
2010-09-11T20:27:07  <jmcarthur> we already know starter packs upload fine. we don't have to have other people do it
2010-09-11T20:27:09  <jmcarthur> caytchen: yeah
2010-09-11T20:27:20  <greghaynes> My not just md5 the starter packages, put them in their own 'sandbox' land
2010-09-11T20:27:52  <dstufft> alternatively, hash the starter packages and fake the output to the end user for those
2010-09-11T20:27:52  <greghaynes> er, why
2010-09-11T20:27:54  <caytchen> i'd say take out the "upload starter package" and replace the sloooow, bad video on the front page with some action videos
2010-09-11T20:27:54  <Cyndre> or if md5 = starter package max games = 1
2010-09-11T20:28:12  <Zaphus> greghaynes:  why not allow peoples first version to be the starter pack ?  they will update it anyway, and then it will be gone
2010-09-11T20:28:12  <Cyndre> allowing them to see a result instantly and get into it

2010-09-11T20:28:20  <j3camero> Okay guys I am going to take down the contest backend to test the fixes for issues 68 and 96. They both relate to improving the backend.
2010-09-11T20:28:30  <greghaynes> w00t
2010-09-11T20:28:45  <jmcarthur> do it
2010-09-11T20:29:24  <Zaphus> j3camero:  68 and 96 - awesome, I like those two fixes
2010-09-11T20:29:35  <jmcarthur> j3camero: any chance of switching to the adjusted elo while we're at it?
2010-09-11T20:29:53  <jmcarthur> j3camero: did you see my more up to date comparison with a bunch of new bots?
2010-09-11T20:30:43  <ratatata> greghaynes: there is not much point in letting starter bots run many games.. I mean.. I bet loads of people will never update the starter pack.. = waste

2010-09-11T20:32:00  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i'd try it if somebody could give me a ratings.txt
2010-09-11T20:32:16  <greghaynes> ratatata: Yes, maybe my suggestion wasnt worded so well: I meant just hash them and dont have them be full participants in the tourney on upload
2010-09-11T20:32:17  <a1k0n> really we could define an objective function to find the next matches based on increasing the overall probability of the model

2010-09-11T20:33:21  <Zaphus> ratatata:  yeah, thats a good reason - but its not going to differ much from someone who edits one line then abandons their bot
2010-09-11T20:34:05  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  I dont think fix 68 does close-ranked matching, just helps those who havent played in a while
2010-09-11T20:34:23  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: ah
2010-09-11T20:34:26  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: well, no, it's bots with not enough games to decide their ranking, and narrowing that down narrows down the rankings of everyone else who played against them
2010-09-11T20:34:28  <caytchen> oh lol, my first win!
2010-09-11T20:34:29  <caytchen> hah.
2010-09-11T20:34:50  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: at least thats from what I could figure reading the patch file.  It also tries to avoid repeat matches

2010-09-11T20:35:00  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: that's kind of what the new scheduler should do if what Zaphus says is true
2010-09-11T20:35:31  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: well, yeah, but it's more of a 30-game threshold kind of thing iirc
2010-09-11T20:35:35  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-11T20:35:45  <a1k0n> repeat matches can also be good
2010-09-11T20:35:52  <caytchen> also, does anyone know if the mono version was updated on the official contest servers?
2010-09-11T20:36:05  <jmcarthur> caytchen: doubtful
2010-09-11T20:36:07  <caytchen> my stuff is full of LINQ.
2010-09-11T20:36:07  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  I know nothing about how the confidence range stuff works, but if a scheduler could choose an opponent that would help increase confidence, while making sure everyone gets a game every X minutes, that would be awesome
2010-09-11T20:37:04  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: i think the idea is to give some priority to bots with a wide confidence interval
2010-09-11T20:37:05  <a1k0n> right now it's totally random?
2010-09-11T20:37:11  <jmcarthur> yeah. horrible
2010-09-11T20:37:26  <a1k0n> so you get binomial(x;rate,time) games per time
2010-09-11T20:37:51  <a1k0n> where rate is games per second/number of players
2010-09-11T20:37:58  <Zeiris> Whoever wrote the visualiser: good job, it's sexy.
2010-09-11T20:38:00  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: basically instead of focusing on bots with few recent games, you focus on bots that we are less certain about their scores
2010-09-11T20:38:06  <a1k0n> which is like 1/2000
2010-09-11T20:38:14  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: those overlap a lot, but not completely
2010-09-11T20:38:33  <Zannick> yeah, programming is hard
2010-09-11T20:38:37  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: I like it, as long as it doesnt keep playing A vs B, or ignoring bots for a long time - everyone needs a game every X hours
2010-09-11T20:39:02  <a1k0n> yeah, the objective could just be optimized under that constraint as long as it's a realistic constraint
2010-09-11T20:39:23  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: for example, if A, B, C, D, and E have all played a few round robins and then E resubmits, A, B, C, and D will all have a wider confidence interval and might get to play a little more again. plus E will get to play a lot
2010-09-11T20:39:26  <ulope> Also newly uploaded bots should get at least one game eraly on

2010-09-11T20:39:57  <jmcarthur> actually, no, A-D won't get a wider interval
2010-09-11T20:39:59  <jmcarthur> n/m
2010-09-11T20:40:08  <jmcarthur> they keep their matches against older bots, don't they?
2010-09-11T20:40:08  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  Question on bayeselo,   for your own bot it uses just the matches since you last uploaded, right ?   what does it do with the older results when scoring other peoples bots ?  eg. jmcarthur played zaphus yesterday, I upload a new bot, is your old result modified in some way ?
2010-09-11T20:40:09  <a1k0n> they will
2010-09-11T20:40:19  <a1k0n> actually hmm, not sure
2010-09-11T20:40:33  <Zannick> hm
2010-09-11T20:40:47  <Zannick> the repo isn't sending notifications anymore
2010-09-11T20:40:50  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i think you're right, but maybe just because there is a new E and they haven't played it yet, not because the old E is gone
2010-09-11T20:40:50  <a1k0n> no, because when it has to re-do the bayeselo thing, it doesn't have a "user-from-some-previous-submission" in there
2010-09-11T20:40:59  <jmcarthur> oh?
2010-09-11T20:41:00  <jmcarthur> okay
2010-09-11T20:41:01  <a1k0n> so their games just disappear to bayeselo
2010-09-11T20:41:05  <jmcarthur> then their intervals will get wider
2010-09-11T20:41:11  <Zannick> nearly 11 hours behind a important comment
2010-09-11T20:41:35  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  so if I resubmit, I can destroy the ranking of the top bot just by pretending I didnt exist when it beat me?
2010-09-11T20:41:42  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: i think my old result would become less certain
2010-09-11T20:41:44  <a1k0n> Zaphus: to some extent yes
2010-09-11T20:42:03  <jmcarthur> it's not as bad as it sounds
2010-09-11T20:42:18  <jmcarthur> and under the proposed kind of scheduler, the top bots would then play a little more and fix it up again
2010-09-11T20:42:19  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: really, it does sound bad :-)
2010-09-11T20:42:27  <a1k0n> it could feed "username-submissionid" into bayeselo actually and get better results
2010-09-11T20:42:32  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: it wouldn't *destroy* their scores
2010-09-11T20:42:41  <a1k0n> maybe it's still even doing that, i haven't actually looked
2010-09-11T20:42:42  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: that could be a good idea
2010-09-11T20:42:53  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: ratings.txt doesn't show old bots
2010-09-11T20:42:58  <jmcarthur> so it's not doing that
2010-09-11T20:43:04  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  agreed, that would be a good way to handle it - you beat the 'old' zaphus but not the new one
2010-09-11T20:43:05  <a1k0n> yeah
2010-09-11T20:43:06  <jmcarthur> but i'm thinking maybe it should, now
2010-09-11T20:43:27  <a1k0n> and each submission is independent, so it's fair, and it gives a lot more data
2010-09-11T20:43:32  <Zannick> except then you might have ten versions of your bot in the top fifty
2010-09-11T20:43:48  <a1k0n> but it might actually add too many parameters to the model and just be crazy bad.
2010-09-11T20:43:49  <Zannick> you'd have to exclude them from rankings even while giving them ratings
2010-09-11T20:44:02  <a1k0n> Zannick: well right, it'd filter out old submissions on the output
2010-09-11T20:44:09  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: there's also trueskill instead of elo. trueskill accounts for skills changing over time. then we could just count them all as the same bot
2010-09-11T20:44:22  <Zaphus> a1k0n: the other option is simple, dont reset the scores at all - just let them move as you win/lose
2010-09-11T20:44:34  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: i wouldn't want a buggy old version of my bot biasing my final results
2010-09-11T20:44:36  <Zannick> also yeah, not sure how bayeselo would like having similar players that never play against each other
2010-09-11T20:44:46  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: it wouldn't bias them. that's the design of trueskill
2010-09-11T20:44:50  <phreeza> i like this game http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284230364|phreeza-0.2|hsBot10.01
2010-09-11T20:44:57  <phreeza> even though my bot lost
2010-09-11T20:44:58  <jmcarthur> as soon as there is a change in your skill, your old result become suspect
2010-09-11T20:45:02  <Zaphus> trueskill doesnt cater for you resetting every few days though

2010-09-11T20:46:43  <phreeza> yea... a lot to learn from that... i'm never sure which calculations to make just exactly right and where i should include tolerances
2010-09-11T20:47:42  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: elo doesn't handle it
2010-09-11T20:47:49  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: oh you mean board resetting?
2010-09-11T20:48:08  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: yeah that's necessary for (bayes)elo, but wouldn't be necessary for trueskill
2010-09-11T20:48:21  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: I mean elo handles human beings who change in skill over time, we dont reset the chess leaderboards every time someone reads a book to improve their skill
2010-09-11T20:48:33  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: real elo does, but i doubt bayeselo does
2010-09-11T20:48:46  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: real elo takes a long time to hone in on, too
2010-09-11T20:49:45  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: actually, elo doesn't do well for people *dropping* in skill, either. it's really only okay with people *rising* in skill. (this is all "if i recall correctly")
2010-09-11T20:49:58  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  does bayeselo get used for anything that human beings do ?
2010-09-11T20:50:54  <Zaphus> Elo handles dropping in skill very well, you lose heaps of points for losing to someone down the ladder that you were supposed to beat 9/10 times
2010-09-11T20:51:19  <jmcarthur> okay you're right, but here's something i know elo handles badly: uncertainty. that's why we are using bayeselo in the first place
2010-09-11T20:51:30  <jmcarthur> trueskill handles uncertainty natively though

2010-09-11T20:53:42  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: trueskill even has a matching system included!
2010-09-11T20:54:07  <Zaphus> it just feels wrong to throw everything away from your old historical matches when you resubmit.    trueskill sounds like the winner to me :-)
2010-09-11T20:55:15  <jmcarthur> trueskill actually shares a lot in common with bayeselo in that it actually keeps a mean and standard deviation associated with each player rather than just a single number like elo does
2010-09-11T20:56:03  <Zaphus> yeah, I really like trueskill - I remember reading a bit about it way back when working on some xbox games
2010-09-11T20:56:04  <jmcarthur> if i could get a bunch of historical data i could play around with it some

2010-09-11T21:01:29  <Zaphus> caytchen: I think thats the only option, rewrite the code to compile under win32
2010-09-11T21:01:31  <caytchen> now that i think of it, i might just turn my c# stuff for the tcp server into some standalone
2010-09-11T21:01:48  <jmcarthur> god just install a linux vm. so much easier than rewriting the whole thing
2010-09-11T21:02:07  <ermau> the tcp client code isn't that complicated, be pretty easy to replicate in C#

2010-09-11T21:27:08  <amstan> j3camero: i restarted it

2010-09-11T21:27:25  <j3camero> amstan: nice. Okay, let's see how long it takes to get crushed.
2010-09-11T21:27:43  <amstan> j3camero: crushed why?
2010-09-11T21:28:09  <j3camero> amstan: I already stop/start apache a few minutes ago. The site was available for a moment, then became unavailable again.
2010-09-11T21:28:29  <amstan> j3camero: well.. we'll see
2010-09-11T21:28:39  <j3camero> amstan: seems to be staying up...
2010-09-11T21:28:42  <amstan> j3camero: how about another restart, see if it still fails?
2010-09-11T21:28:46  <hornairs> anyone have any tips about how to redirect sterr to my term?
2010-09-11T21:28:58  <hornairs> so i can get any stack traces
2010-09-11T21:29:12  <amstan> hornairs: there's an issue about that
2010-09-11T21:29:19  <j3camero> hornairs: we are working on that. For now, I would recommend writing debug messages into a log file and then looking at the log file after the crash.
2010-09-11T21:29:20  <amstan> hornairs: even a patch if i'm not mistaken
2010-09-11T21:29:31  <amstan> j3camero: he wants stack traces, he can't use logs for that
2010-09-11T21:29:46  <j3camero> Yep, but at least you can debug
2010-09-11T21:29:49  <amstan> hornairs: did you try using tee?
2010-09-11T21:29:52  <j3camero> It's a decent workaround
2010-09-11T21:29:59  <hornairs> no never heard of it
2010-09-11T21:30:00  <bss03> I thought PlayGame.java was fixed to dump stderr from the bots to the console now.
2010-09-11T21:30:23  <hornairs> are there better debugging facilities in the tcp server or is it the same deal?
2010-09-11T21:30:37  <hornairs> and amstan, j3camero, thanks for the help and all your hard work
2010-09-11T21:30:38  <caytchen> hornairs: with the tcp server, you host your bot yourself
2010-09-11T21:30:46  <amstan> hornairs: http://pastebin.com/FMrN0U41
2010-09-11T21:30:47  <caytchen> so you got all the debugging you could possibly think of heh
2010-09-11T21:31:08  <amstan> hornairs: so.. add 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 | tee stderr.txt at the end of the bot command
2010-09-11T21:31:43  <amstan> j3camero: so.. wanna try restarting?
2010-09-11T21:32:16  <amstan> j3camero: if it happens again you do ps aux|grep apache
2010-09-11T21:32:23  <amstan> j3camero: then kill -9 all the processes there
2010-09-11T21:33:16  <hornairs> amstan, thanks, tried it and nothing new came up and no file was created but i think it might be me
2010-09-11T21:33:51  <amstan> hornairs: what do you use to run the tournament?
2010-09-11T21:34:07  <hornairs> a ruby system call which i think is swallowing something
2010-09-11T21:34:27  <j3camero> amstan: thanks. Is that what you did?
2010-09-11T21:34:39  <amstan> j3camero: yeah, to solve that port 80 is used error

2010-09-11T21:36:28  <j3camero> amstan: why did this happen do you think? What was the initial cause? Did apache run out of connections or something?
2010-09-11T21:36:52  <amstan> j3camero: well.. the restart failed, something's fishy with that..

2010-09-11T21:37:47  <j3camero> amstan: let me know before you do a restart or whatever.
2010-09-11T21:37:55  <Zaphus> ok, got my first match on benzedrine - java code works on win32 (if you ignore the fact that it asks for one more argument than it needs)

2010-09-11T21:39:31  <antimatroid1> i tried cigwin before but it wouldn't pick up gcc, tried adding it to my environment variables to no avail
2010-09-11T21:39:42  <Zaphus> grabbed the java code from the forum,  then just   javac TCP.java   then   java TCP  arguements
2010-09-11T21:40:01  <antimatroid1> onto it, thanks
2010-09-11T21:40:04  <Zannick> well, i just got an email for a comment made on an issue...some few hours ago
2010-09-11T21:40:05  <Zaphus> throw in a spare arguement at the end, it asks for 5 but only uses 4
2010-09-11T21:41:11  <antimatroid1> wait, are you writing your bot in java?
2010-09-11T21:41:35  <amstan> j3camero: [Sat Sep 11 20:30:11 2010] [error] server reached MaxClients setting, consider raising the MaxClients setting
2010-09-11T21:42:23  <j3camero> amstan: ah okay, that's what I thought. We will have to watch out. If you decide to change anything configuration-wise, please let the mailing list know so that Daniel knows.\
2010-09-11T21:42:33  <amstan> j3camero: can i raise it?
2010-09-11T21:43:02  <Zaphus> antimatroid1:  nope, C++  just launching it from Java just like running planetwars frmo java
2010-09-11T21:44:37  <Zaphus> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284254966|a1k0n-0.2|Zaphus  great battle over the center planet :-)
2010-09-11T21:45:39  <j3camero> amstan: yeah go ahead and raise it. The only downside would be that it might start using too much memory and start thrashing to disk. We'll know if that happens because the site will get slower and slower, rather suddenly.
2010-09-11T21:46:01  <j3camero> But let Daniel know what you're doing, and why. Use the mailing list before you make changes.
2010-09-11T21:46:04  <amstan> j3camero: so like... it's either raising or people start getting page denials
2010-09-11T21:46:17  <amstan> j3camero: it's not an issue of not raising it, it's an issue of server power
2010-09-11T21:46:26  <amstan> j3camero: if we reach the limits for the hardware no config will help
2010-09-11T21:46:57  <j3camero> amstan: yeah that's why we should raise it. But if we raise it too high then we will go overboard on ram usage and start thrashing. Then we would get page denials as well. It's a balancing act. Don't raise it by ten times. Just double it, maybe.
2010-09-11T21:47:21  <j3camero> If it turns out we need a bigger server, we can do that.
2010-09-11T21:47:30  <ulope> j3camero: what kind of specs does this server have?
2010-09-11T21:47:37  <bss03> amstan: How much RES ram does each Apache process have?
2010-09-11T21:47:45  <j3camero> Or if we get some help from someone more experienced, we could even get many servers and start load balancing.
2010-09-11T21:47:46  <amstan> j3camero: ok.. new commands: /etc/init.d/apache2 stop, killall apache2; /etc/init.d/apache2 start
2010-09-11T21:47:47  <bss03> amstan: How much free RAM does the server have?
2010-09-11T21:47:52  <amstan> j3camero: it does this all the time
2010-09-11T21:47:56  <bss03> amstan: Divide, increase by that amount.
2010-09-11T21:47:57  <j3camero> ulope: shitty specs. It's a cheap server.
2010-09-11T21:48:12  <amstan>              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

2010-09-11T21:48:34  <j3camero> amstan: fuck. yeah, we don't too much extra memory to play with.
2010-09-11T21:48:45  <bss03> So, assuming all that used is apache, you can only raise by about 15%.
2010-09-11T21:48:49  <bss03> amstan ^^
2010-09-11T21:48:54  <amstan> j3camero: i don't understand why you didn't do this earlier
2010-09-11T21:49:00  <j3camero> amstan: don't raise the client limit, then.
2010-09-11T21:49:19  <amstan> bss03, j3camero: that's ram usage after raising and restarting

2010-09-11T21:49:57  <j3camero> amstan: okay we have two options. (1) get a server with more memory (2) get one or two more shitty servers, switch to database-based sessions for PHP, and do poor-mans load balancing using the DNS entries. What do you think?
2010-09-11T21:50:31  *** ath888 <ath888!5738334a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.87.56.51.74> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2010-09-11T21:50:34  <amstan> j3camero: i think we should decentralize the tournament
2010-09-11T21:50:47  <amstan> j3camero: have the games on corn-syrup, my server and a few others
2010-09-11T21:50:53  *** Nessphoro <Nessphoro!4b98d0ee@gateway/web/freenode/ip.75.152.208.238> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2010-09-11T21:50:55  <amstan> j3camero: then buy the best server you can find for http
2010-09-11T21:51:14  <ulope> j3camero: my offer still stands (about the root server i have that not doing anything)
2010-09-11T21:51:21  <jmcarthur> holy crap
2010-09-11T21:51:46  <amstan> j3camero: it's not only memory that's the problem
2010-09-11T21:52:08  <dstufft> Why not switch to something like nginx
2010-09-11T21:52:33  <jmcarthur> that would be a temporary solution at best wouldn't it?
2010-09-11T21:52:40  <dstufft> sort of
2010-09-11T21:52:41  <ulope> dstufft: Yes. I would have suggested taht as well. but with the ancient ubuntu on the box that all much hardern than it needs
2010-09-11T21:52:41  <amstan> dstufft: games use most of the cpu actually
2010-09-11T21:53:08  <j3camero> Decentralizing the tournament is something we should think about later. Imagine the problems associated with updating the contest software on five different servers whenever we make a change. Let's just move to a bigger server to fix the crisis, then we will try to make a more lasting fix after that.
2010-09-11T21:53:09  <dstufft> amstan: doesn't mean you can't give the games more cpu/memory by getting rid of the highly ineffecient apache
2010-09-11T21:53:15  <jmcarthur> the games should certainly be decentralized
2010-09-11T21:53:44  <amstan> j3camero: you already use sftp and scp for stuff
2010-09-11T21:53:47  <jmcarthur> aren't there tools designed to make distributing changes to multiple servers easy?
2010-09-11T21:53:55  <amstan> j3camero: we can just have the sandboxing installed on the other servers
2010-09-11T21:54:09  <amstan> j3camero: and ssh into them on a different port for the sandboxes
2010-09-11T21:54:26  <amstan> so.. ssh hypertriangle.com -p 4201 will access sandbox1
2010-09-11T21:54:45  <amstan> tournament manager can still run on the http server
2010-09-11T21:54:45  <j3camero> amstan: yeah, the decentralization could probably be set up fairly quickly. It's pretty much ready to go.
2010-09-11T21:55:00  <amstan> j3camero: so.. is the TM on right now?
2010-09-11T21:55:12  <amstan> looks like it..
2010-09-11T21:55:34  <j3camero> The tM is not on
2010-09-11T21:55:36  <Cyndre> why not do it like the tcp server with submitting the code
2010-09-11T21:55:37  <amstan> it's doing fairly well now, cpu wise
2010-09-11T21:55:57  <amstan> Cyndre: how can you be sure you don't have human players?
2010-09-11T21:56:01  <greghaynes> About the tools for making distributed server changes - we use puppet for that where im at
2010-09-11T21:56:15  <Cyndre> amstan: because when you goto do the final round the code will lose instantly
2010-09-11T21:56:17  <jmcarthur> greghaynes: any good?
2010-09-11T21:56:24  <j3camero> amstan: how are we doing on memory right now?
2010-09-11T21:56:32  <amstan> j3camero: 200mb left
2010-09-11T21:56:34  <greghaynes> Supposedly, I dont know anything else
2010-09-11T21:56:34  <amstan> pretty bad
2010-09-11T21:57:02  <amstan> greghaynes: volunteers won't be comfortable giving root access to their private servers
2010-09-11T21:57:07  <jmcarthur> is this a physical access server?
2010-09-11T21:57:16  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: llame, claims it can't find the main class in the java file
2010-09-11T21:57:28  <jmcarthur> amstan: i'd give a vm in a heartbeat if i had the horsepower
2010-09-11T21:57:33  <j3camero> amstan: is that margin shrinking? We have to avoid running out of memory, even if it means putting the maxclients back to 150.
2010-09-11T21:57:41  <dstufft> j3camero: if you want nginx I'm familar it uses a lot less memory then apache
2010-09-11T21:57:52  <greghaynes> amstan: Possibly, I think my uni could work something out if youall had specific needs to request
2010-09-11T21:58:00  <jmcarthur> if this is a physical access server i would buy a stick of extra ram and pop it in immediately
2010-09-11T21:58:23  <amstan> jmcarthur: it's a PVS, rented
2010-09-11T21:58:27  <jmcarthur> dang
2010-09-11T21:58:29  <Zaphus> antimatroid1:   make sure the filename is TCP.java (upper case probably matters),   then run    javac TCP.java     does that work ?
2010-09-11T21:59:10  <antimatroid1> nope, hates it still
2010-09-11T21:59:14  <amstan> j3camero: yeah.. ram is getting less and less
2010-09-11T21:59:16  <antimatroid1> always had capitals
2010-09-11T21:59:28  <amstan> wait..
2010-09-11T21:59:30  <amstan> nvm
2010-09-11T21:59:36  <Zaphus> javac  not java
2010-09-11T21:59:39  <jmcarthur> you might be seeing bots stop and start
2010-09-11T21:59:54  <antimatroid1> claims it doesn;t have javac
2010-09-11T21:59:58  <j3camero> amstan: can you keep watching the ram? update us with the general trend.
2010-09-11T21:59:59  <antimatroid1> maybe i need a java compiler?

2010-09-11T22:00:44  <Zaphus> it's a .java

2010-09-11T22:01:09  <greghaynes> Not 100% on .javas though
2010-09-11T22:01:12  <Zaphus> or, can I send him my .jar over IRC ?
2010-09-11T22:01:30  <greghaynes> dcc
2010-09-11T22:01:36  <caytchen> just that never works heh
2010-09-11T22:01:49  <greghaynes> Yea, who knows, you could get lucky ;)
2010-09-11T22:01:54  <antimatroid1> Zaphus i could send you my email via pm? :P
2010-09-11T22:01:59  <Zaphus> sure
2010-09-11T22:02:10  <Zaphus> all I have to do is figure out how to make a .jar now :-)
2010-09-11T22:02:19  <Zaphus> oh, the .class will work , that should do it
2010-09-11T22:04:10  <greghaynes> Are matches not currently being run?
2010-09-11T22:04:24  <antimatroid1> i'm not getting any
2010-09-11T22:04:35  <antimatroid1> although could just be taking that long to give each person a game
2010-09-11T22:04:37  <greghaynes> Yes, but im talking about the competition ;)
2010-09-11T22:04:46  <antimatroid1> i know
2010-09-11T22:04:49  <greghaynes> (zing)
2010-09-11T22:05:03  <amstan> j3camero: zerd here reminded me that most of the memory is cached
2010-09-11T22:05:18  <amstan> j3camero: so.. there's only like 300mb used
2010-09-11T22:05:25  <greghaynes> Yep, so youre a ways from swapping
2010-09-11T22:05:33  * amstan 's an idiot
2010-09-11T22:05:35  <amstan> lol
2010-09-11T22:05:58  <jmcarthur> haha
2010-09-11T22:06:01  <greghaynes> That will swap before the cache hits 0 though, beware
2010-09-11T22:06:13  <dstufft> what version of ubuntu is the server running on?
2010-09-11T22:06:18  <jmcarthur> 8.04
2010-09-11T22:06:32  <ulope> amstan: how much memory does that server have in total?
2010-09-11T22:06:34  <dstufft> kk
2010-09-11T22:06:44  <amstan> amstan@ltfs1110:/etc/apache2$ free -m
2010-09-11T22:06:46  <amstan>              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
2010-09-11T22:06:47  <amstan> Mem:          2026       1818        208          0         14       1595
2010-09-11T22:06:48  <amstan> -/+ buffers/cache:        208       1818
2010-09-11T22:06:50  <amstan> Swap:         2055        105       1950
2010-09-11T22:07:43  <ulope> So mybe you could put a varnish instance before it. There memory for that would be there
2010-09-11T22:09:15  <antimatroid1> woo, won first match
2010-09-11T22:09:36  <greghaynes> You got put in a match?
2010-09-11T22:09:37  <caytchen> you on tcp now?
2010-09-11T22:09:41  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-09-11T22:09:48  <antimatroid1> all thanks to Zaphur
2010-09-11T22:09:55  <j3camero> amstan: could you explain this cached memory issue to me? I don't udnerstand.
2010-09-11T22:10:09  <j3camero> How do we not have only 208 MB free?
2010-09-11T22:10:27  <Cyndre> our bots fighting each other right now?
2010-09-11T22:10:41  <caytchen> Cyndre: just done :/
2010-09-11T22:10:47  <greghaynes> j3camero: Free = unused, linux will take unused mem and case random disk data in RAM so its not wasted, it then is put in cached instead of free
2010-09-11T22:11:00  <greghaynes> j3camero: When more mem is needed that cached mem is free'd up
2010-09-11T22:11:06  <Cyndre> You WIN against caytchen   hehe
2010-09-11T22:11:12  <jmcarthur> j3camero: when linux reads things from the filesystem and then closes them, it doesn't necessarily free that memory immediately in case the files get read again
2010-09-11T22:11:27  <jmcarthur> basically
2010-09-11T22:11:48  <zerd> free memory = wasted memory
2010-09-11T22:11:52  <jmcarthur> exactly
2010-09-11T22:11:58  <j3camero> I understand.
2010-09-11T22:12:04  <jmcarthur> disk is the new tape
2010-09-11T22:12:12  <amstan> lol
2010-09-11T22:12:22  <jmcarthur> technically ram is the new disk, as well
2010-09-11T22:12:28  <greghaynes> NVRam is the new disk!
2010-09-11T22:12:36  <greghaynes> ...I wish
2010-09-11T22:12:39  <j3camero> If we cut down the amount of memory available for the filesystem cache by having apache soak up more ram, what other side effects would that have? Is this relatively safe?
2010-09-11T22:12:42  <Cyndre> not sure how I turned it around caytchen http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284256946|caytchen|Cyndre
2010-09-11T22:13:02  <amstan> j3camero: file reads will be slower
2010-09-11T22:13:05  <greghaynes> j3camero: Definitely, just dont hit the limit where you use of so much of the ram you start swapping
2010-09-11T22:13:10  <jmcarthur> http://i.imgur.com/X1Hi1.gif
2010-09-11T22:13:19  <Cyndre> sugestion for the visiualizer - a line that runs across the graph while the game plays back
2010-09-11T22:13:29  <greghaynes> That generally happens with ~85% mem usage depending on your swapiness value
2010-09-11T22:13:36  <caytchen> heh whenever i look at one of my games i have no freaking idea whats going on because there are just crazy amounts of fleets
2010-09-11T22:13:53  <caytchen> and with most of them i just seem to move ships from a to b and back again lol..
2010-09-11T22:13:54  <j3camero> How slowly/quickly will that cache shrink in the short term if we immediately boost the maxclient setting for apache? Will be start swapping if apache starts using more memory before Linux has time to reduce the amount of ram being used for cache?
2010-09-11T22:14:01  <bss03> Cyndre: Suggestion for the visualizer: Use the graph at the bottom as a scrubber.
2010-09-11T22:14:02  <Cyndre> the graph at the bottom really help
2010-09-11T22:14:04  <Cyndre> s
2010-09-11T22:14:05  <jmcarthur> interestingly, that diagram i linked to shows exactly why my language of choice doesn't always perform on par with C

2010-09-11T22:14:11  <bss03> For jumping to a particular position in the game.
2010-09-11T22:14:18  <Cyndre> yea, was going to say that but thought I was asking to much as it was
2010-09-11T22:14:39  <jmcarthur> its ram:cache ratio is often much higher than good C code
2010-09-11T22:14:42  <greghaynes> j3camero: Itll drain cache for use until it it reaches near 15% of ram usage then itll start swapping
2010-09-11T22:15:08  <greghaynes> You can tweak the limits by setting swapiness lower if you notice it swapping
2010-09-11T22:15:26  <jmcarthur> IMO, when you hit swap, you might as well just turn the whole machine off
2010-09-11T22:15:44  <greghaynes> Yea, youre pretty hosed especially if its due to something like apache
2010-09-11T22:15:48  <jmcarthur> i often don't even run my machines with swap
2010-09-11T22:15:54  <jmcarthur> not servers, mind you
2010-09-11T22:15:58  <ulope> greghaynes: Or swapoff'ing it if you can live with suddenly killed proceses
2010-09-11T22:16:03  <greghaynes> Well, then youre REALLY hosed when it happens ;)
2010-09-11T22:16:09  <jmcarthur> you're hose anyway
2010-09-11T22:16:12  <caytchen> remember your friend the oom killer
2010-09-11T22:16:14  <j3camero> Okay, so we raised maxclients from 150 to 250 a few minutes ago. What could we safely raise it to right now without risking any problems in the short term (as it ramps up) or the long term?
2010-09-11T22:16:21  <jmcarthur> you're gonna have to reboot or kill something either way
2010-09-11T22:16:29  <j3camero> amstan: are you following this?
2010-09-11T22:16:42  <jmcarthur> i hate the OOM killer. seriously linux, why do you have to do it that way?
2010-09-11T22:17:07  <greghaynes> I dont know how the apache memory usage curve goes...remember the mem usage from before, plot now, extrapolate
2010-09-11T22:17:23  <jmcarthur> extrapolating isn't very useful either :(
2010-09-11T22:17:41  <greghaynes> Well, you can at least try and see if its linear-ish
2010-09-11T22:17:46  <greghaynes> I suspect it may not be
2010-09-11T22:17:52  <jmcarthur> very few things are
2010-09-11T22:17:53  <amstan> greghaynes: that means a restart for each point
2010-09-11T22:18:24  <amstan> contestbot: rankings
2010-09-11T22:18:25  <contestbot> amstan: Top 10 players: dmj111(2829), albert(2810), seigen(2776), Kavish(2746), strank(2711), drewrobb(2702), danielvf(2699), sighbot(2681), cheese_bot(2665), vortex(2649)
2010-09-11T22:18:32  <amstan> seems pretty instant right now
2010-09-11T22:18:34  <jmcarthur> if we had a reverse proxy in front of this we could reroute to a temporary server and a message while we play with this one
2010-09-11T22:18:39  <amstan> except the TM is off
2010-09-11T22:18:44  <greghaynes> amstan: Most web server have a method to reload config without denying requests while it happens
2010-09-11T22:18:46  <bss03> jmarthur: That diagram is impressive... especiall since I had to zoom in a dozen times in my igame viewer to see what it WAS.
2010-09-11T22:19:02  <amstan> greghaynes: i don't think a simple reload will be able to change maxclients
2010-09-11T22:19:04  <jmcarthur> bss03: it's actually become even worse since that diagram was made
2010-09-11T22:19:06  <bss03> jmcarthur: Turn off the OOM killer.
2010-09-11T22:19:11  <jmcarthur> bss03: CPUs got a bit faster and HDs didn't
2010-09-11T22:19:19  <jmcarthur> bss03: yeah, then you just freeze
2010-09-11T22:19:20  <bss03> jmcarthur: Force all allocations to be reserved.
2010-09-11T22:19:24  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-11T22:19:33  <jmcarthur> if only processes were so disciplined
2010-09-11T22:19:39  <bss03> jmcarthur: That's how I run my servers, desktop, and laptop.
2010-09-11T22:19:49  <bss03> jmcarthur: It's a /proc/sus option.
2010-09-11T22:20:08  <bss03> jmcarthur: Then the malloc() call fails.  The program might crash or just write a log message.
2010-09-11T22:20:26  <bss03> jmcarthur: logcheck mails me the log messages every hour (after filtering for ignorable ones).
2010-09-11T22:20:45  <jmcarthur> bss03: that does seem nicer, but would suck if the program that crashes was *not* the program taking all the memory
2010-09-11T22:20:58  <bss03> /proc/sus -> /proc/sys -> /etc/sysctl.conf
2010-09-11T22:21:06  <greghaynes> Then you glaze over the logcheck messages while reading your email until someone yells at you to fix it. ;)
2010-09-11T22:21:31  <jmcarthur> i am a fan of fail hard, but that only works if you have a good recovery strategy
2010-09-11T22:21:35  <bss03> Yeah, that happens.  But, I at least know there's a memory issue an can check on it, rather than trusting the OOM killer to get it right.
2010-09-11T22:21:40  <jmcarthur> on my desktop... i don't really :)
2010-09-11T22:21:46  <greghaynes> Yep
2010-09-11T22:21:47  <bss03> Too often I've seen the OOM killer enter a process killing loop.

2010-09-11T22:22:33  <bss03> graghaybes: Nah, I'm pretty active at fixing logcheck issues, or writing rules so I don't see that message, normally.
2010-09-11T22:22:36  <caytchen> like a game of this ai challenge heh
2010-09-11T22:22:42  <jmcarthur> sometimes i wish malloc was just blocking
2010-09-11T22:23:01  <j3camero> amstan: leave the maxclients at 250 for now. I think we may be relatively safe there. Any higher and we risk more serious problems with RAM.
2010-09-11T22:23:09  <bss03> greghaynes: Drupal is a bit verbose in it's logging of small-ish errors, so I don't have rules for all of those yet. :(
2010-09-11T22:23:13  <amstan> j3camero: check the mail
2010-09-11T22:24:00  <bss03> jmcarthur: Blocking malloc sounds potentially bad.  I can see why you'd want it for certain applications though.
2010-09-11T22:24:31  <bss03> jmcarthur: If your program seriously can't do anythign else until it gets some memory, it's appropriate for the kernel to block it and wait for memory to free up, I think.
2010-09-11T22:24:32  <jmcarthur> bss03: blocking by default, is perhaps what i mean
2010-09-11T22:24:46  <jmcarthur> bss03: but where a program could opt out of that for critical things

2010-09-11T22:25:01  <jmcarthur> or perhaps it should be the other way around...
2010-09-11T22:25:05  <bss03> jmcarthur: Yeah, as long as there was a try_malloc() that didn't block, I'd be *fine* with malloc blocking.
2010-09-11T22:25:14  <caytchen> remember linux overallocates anyway
2010-09-11T22:25:25  <caytchen> it's like blocking malloc just better ;o
2010-09-11T22:25:26  <bss03> caytchen: Not *my* linux.
2010-09-11T22:25:29  <jmcarthur> caytchen: not if you do reserved allocations like bss03 does
2010-09-11T22:25:40  <bss03> caytchen: I trun off the overcommit and OOM killer.
2010-09-11T22:26:31  <j3camero> amstan: good mail message. Thanks.
2010-09-11T22:27:06  <bss03> The heuristic the OOM killer uses is actually very good, but I've had cases where the results were... not so good... and I prefer malloc() to fail-fast.

2010-09-11T22:27:18  <ckoehler> hi there
2010-09-11T22:27:26  <ckoehler> how would i go about debugging my python bot?
2010-09-11T22:27:39  <ckoehler> what do you guys do to get debug output etc?
2010-09-11T22:27:40  <caytchen> use the tcp server
2010-09-11T22:27:45  <amstan> ckoehler: print to file
2010-09-11T22:27:45  <bss03> Use the tcp server, write messages and crap to stderr.
2010-09-11T22:27:47  <jmcarthur> "[...] reading from L1 cache is like grabbing a piece of paper from your desk (3 seconds), L2 cache is picking up a book from a nearby shelf (14 seconds), and main system memory is taking a 4-minute walk down the hall to buy a Twix bar. [...] waiting for a hard drive seek is like leaving the building to roam the earth for one year and three months."
2010-09-11T22:28:15  <bss03> I'm not sure exactly how the tcpserver works, but you may even be able to tee stdout so that it gets sent to the server and a file, too.
2010-09-11T22:28:18  <greghaynes> Actually, I dont think that does it justice
2010-09-11T22:28:29  <jmcarthur> the analogy?
2010-09-11T22:28:43  <greghaynes> I think its more like leaving your office, developing your own form of space travel, going to a distant planet, and returning
2010-09-11T22:28:57  <Zannick> hahaha
2010-09-11T22:29:22  <bss03> jmcarthur: L1 = from memory; L2 = look it up on your phone, RAM = look it up at the library, HD = undiscovered information that a Ph.D. might think about next decade or so.

2010-09-11T22:32:54  <Zaphus> just noticed the canvas playback seems to miss the final result (i.e. you dont see yourself take that final planet to end the game) if there is nothing in flight :-(  might be the engine itself not sending it out
2010-09-11T22:33:06  <amstan> j3camero: where did you get that?
2010-09-11T22:33:20  <j3camero> amstan: perhaps if something slows down a little bit, then each page requests takes a little longer, so they stack up. If our page requests took 3 times as long, we would be at 150.

2010-09-11T22:34:46  <j3camero> amstan: this suggests that we may be much higher than 50, if each worker is serving many pages at ocne.

2010-09-11T22:48:58  <iFire> jmcarthur so am I out of luck?
2010-09-11T22:49:07  <jmcarthur> iFire: and 6.8.2 also generates relatively slow binaries

2010-09-11T22:49:52  <jmcarthur> iFire: i'm currently coding for a recent version in the hopes that we can get sandboxing to work well enough to trust binaries
2010-09-11T22:50:08  <jmcarthur> iFire: if that doesn't work, well, i could port my code to work in 6.8.2 if i needed to i guess

2010-09-11T22:59:52  <amstan> jmcarthur: what?
2010-09-11T23:00:02  <dstufft> question re the tm, what timeout are you running it with, and how often are you starting it from cron?
2010-09-11T23:00:05  <j3camero> amstan: the issue with decentralizing right now is that we might use a shit ton of bandwidth sending people's bots across the internet, which might put us over our allowed bandwidth of 4 TB per month. We could get a second server inside the same DC in the next day or so, and use that one as a worker node. Intrad-DC bandwidth is free.
2010-09-11T23:00:06  <jmcarthur> nicing won't help ram
2010-09-11T23:00:10  <jmcarthur> and it would make bots suck more

2010-09-11T23:01:02  <j3camero> amstan: but one extra server will basically fix the problem in the short term, right?
2010-09-11T23:01:10  <amstan> j3camero: if we do decentralize we can have limitless number of matches
2010-09-11T23:01:15  <amstan> j3camero: volunteers and all that
2010-09-11T23:01:34  <dstufft> amstan: you have to worry about the validity of data then
2010-09-11T23:01:35  <j3camero> Yeah, but bandwidth limits are bandwidth limits.
2010-09-11T23:01:50  <amstan> j3camero: have a way to store bots
2010-09-11T23:01:54  <j3camero> amstan: I will do some calculations to see what sort of bandwidth we would be using. Give me a few minutes.
2010-09-11T23:02:02  <ulope> If you guys have 4TB free that means you can use about 135 GB/day... that should be enough for a few bots
2010-09-11T23:02:02  <jmcarthur> dstufft: not a big deal if we just cycle the bots around so that no one machine can control the fate of a bot
2010-09-11T23:02:08  <Cyndre> dstufft: not really, at the end of the day the final bots are the submitted ones representing the one you have running
2010-09-11T23:02:17  <amstan> ulope: each match the bots have to be reuploaded

2010-09-11T23:02:52  <amstan> Cyndre: that's how it works.. for each match, start the 2 VMS, upload the bots, run them
2010-09-11T23:02:54  <j3camero> Cyndre: because that's just the way it is right now. It would take more time to design it another way.

2010-09-11T23:03:57  <Cyndre> amstan: let people run their own bots on their machine
2010-09-11T23:04:03  <jmcarthur> depends on if you do binaries or source
2010-09-11T23:04:13  <jmcarthur> amstan: the compressed java starter package is over 2 megs
2010-09-11T23:04:25  <j3camero> amstan: okay I will be AFK for about 1/2-hour. When I come back I will see if it's safe to send bots over the network by estimating the average size of a compiled bot. Can you start to find volunteers and get credentials on their boxes? Can you see if the CSC will lend us corn-syrup for the contest? Probably want to talk to hat guy and spang about that.
2010-09-11T23:04:29  <amstan> jmcarthur: umm... nvm then
2010-09-11T23:04:31  <ulope> amstan: so you can send out about 140 tousand bots per day
2010-09-11T23:04:35  <bss03> Cyndre: I think there may be a lot of cheating possible that way... maybe.
2010-09-11T23:04:56  <Cyndre> bss03: but the final results will be based on submitted bot, maybe 1 or 2 cheats, but the true winners will stand out
2010-09-11T23:04:58  <j3camero> amstan: keep in mind that anyone running a worker node would be ineligible for the whole rest of the contest.
2010-09-11T23:04:59  <jmcarthur> bss03: i think for this particular game most bots will beat most humans
2010-09-11T23:05:13  <jmcarthur> bss03: the only cheating could be unfair amount of computing resources
2010-09-11T23:05:14  <bss03> jmcarthur: I agree.
2010-09-11T23:05:21  <j3camero> bbiab
2010-09-11T23:05:28  <jmcarthur> and without authentication, identity theft
2010-09-11T23:05:28  <amstan> j3camero: this can be done even on desktop comps
2010-09-11T23:05:38  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: which would fail on final contest ranking when they do it themselves
2010-09-11T23:05:55  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: yeah, which makes the tcp server even less reliable for testing anyway
2010-09-11T23:06:02  <bss03> jmcarthur: I suppose that's true.  I'm just thinking huge amount of pre-computed data, but it's possible the random maps make that too hard.

2010-09-11T23:06:30  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: unreliability?
2010-09-11T23:06:55  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: if your bot works for the tcp server and not the official because the official server has less resources then the tcp server fails to be a good testing device
2010-09-11T23:07:22  <dstufft> for what it's worth
2010-09-11T23:07:29  <Cyndre> meant cheating
2010-09-11T23:07:32  <Cyndre> wise
2010-09-11T23:07:39  <jmcarthur> don't even care about cheating, honestly
2010-09-11T23:07:43  <Cyndre> same
2010-09-11T23:07:48  <dstufft> i could probably donate some resources server wise
2010-09-11T23:07:50  <jmcarthur> except for the final tournament
2010-09-11T23:08:17  <Cyndre> at which point they could use 3 machines - 2 clients and 1 main server
2010-09-11T23:08:22  <jmcarthur> the main issue i see with distributed TM is that hosts can see the source code, especially of bots written in interpreted languages
2010-09-11T23:08:33  <j3camero> amstan: cool. Can you find a few servers? Maybe even hypertriangle and corn-syrup would do for now.
2010-09-11T23:08:52  <Cyndre> I agree with you on that
2010-09-11T23:09:03  <amstan> hypertriangle is pretty much unused, it has 2 cpus that your main server has
2010-09-11T23:09:19  <j3camero> amstan: how much ram? We are currently ram-bound
2010-09-11T23:09:31  <ckoehler> hm my bot times out when i try to write stuff to a file
2010-09-11T23:09:32  <amstan> j3camero: we're ram bound because of http and mysql
2010-09-11T23:09:40  <amstan> j3camero: 2GB
2010-09-11T23:09:41  <jmcarthur> if you're just running bots the ram is a nonissue
2010-09-11T23:09:48  <j3camero> amstan: oh yeah of coruse you're right. The bots would be CPU bound

2010-09-11T23:10:39  <dstufft> might be able to use celery
2010-09-11T23:11:00  <zerd> j3camero: how was the computer setup on the tron challenge? did you run the bots on the web-server then too?
2010-09-11T23:11:08  <jmcarthur> amstan: i'm a little skeptical of the distributed idea now unless volunteers are disqualified from the contest
2010-09-11T23:11:13  <amstan> dstufft: i think that any root people for the comps that will get used for bots should be disqualified
2010-09-11T23:11:24  <jmcarthur> yeah...
2010-09-11T23:11:28  <amstan> jmcarthur: yes.. but there's about 4 volunteers
2010-09-11T23:11:31  <amstan> that might be enough
2010-09-11T23:11:32  <caytchen> i'd say just copy the benzedrine tcp server model... sure you'd have to run your comp for it to get battles but still it completely circumvents all the other problems: * stolen source code, * incompatible dev. tools version, * resources, * unsafe native code etc.
2010-09-11T23:11:34  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-09-11T23:11:36  <jmcarthur> yeah, could be
2010-09-11T23:11:57  <jmcarthur> if we run this on volunteer machines we should definitely fix up the sandbox
2010-09-11T23:12:04  <jmcarthur> qemu+kvm for sure
2010-09-11T23:12:11  <jmcarthur> or virtualbox, maybe

2010-09-11T23:12:52  <jmcarthur> both need kernel exts, so i guess the choice is arbitrary. we already have qemu in the repo though
2010-09-11T23:12:53  *** bss03 is now known as bss03-AFK
2010-09-11T23:12:53  <amstan> have it easy to deploy
2010-09-11T23:12:56  <antimatroid1> that was a close match for a while :(
2010-09-11T23:13:02  <jmcarthur> oh, you mean vb the entire setup
2010-09-11T23:13:06  <jmcarthur> that could work too
2010-09-11T23:13:08  <j3camero> Anybody who is running a worker node would not be able to compete any more. makes sure people know this, amstan.
2010-09-11T23:13:10  <jmcarthur> but doesn't help the sandbox
2010-09-11T23:13:21  <antimatroid1> actually not really aha
2010-09-11T23:13:26  <ulope> jmcarthur: Not really the kernel modules for kvm are already in the latest ubuntu
2010-09-11T23:13:47  <jmcarthur> ulope: yeah, so we'd just need to upgrade the bot servers.... not a problem for me :D
2010-09-11T23:14:22  <jmcarthur> so does kvm inside another vm actually work?

2010-09-11T23:15:54  <jmcarthur> in 2008
2010-09-11T23:15:58  <jmcarthur> lemme find something newer
2010-09-11T23:17:02  <a1k0n> j3camero: if someone supplies a patch, and i test and review it, can i just commit it to trunk?
2010-09-11T23:17:16  <Cyndre> still don't understand the problem with the tcp server - couldnt you have a wrapper for the bot that limits the avaliable resources to it?
2010-09-11T23:17:18  <rogue780__> amstan, the issue isn't listed
2010-09-11T23:17:22  <ulope> But the question is. Is nested virt. even needed? Why not just run the vms on a normal account
2010-09-11T23:17:46  <amstan> rogue780__: make one
2010-09-11T23:17:46  <Queue29> Cyndre, then it'd have to be close source, else it would be pointless
2010-09-11T23:18:04  <amstan> rogue780__: sorry about this, but we're having a few problems with server load, that should be fixed first
2010-09-11T23:18:04  <jmcarthur> ulope: i think amstan was thinking we could just have a vm image to distribute to the hosts so they don't have to be set up individually
2010-09-11T23:18:12  <jmcarthur> but that may be unnecessary
2010-09-11T23:18:16  <jmcarthur> there are tools for this kind of thing
2010-09-11T23:18:22  <ulope> jmcarthur: Yeah well true
2010-09-11T23:18:31  <Cyndre> Queue29: no, only to make sure your final code will run on final server

2010-09-11T23:33:28  <a1k0n> another random idea: why not use something less sucky than apache?  like nginx?

2010-09-11T23:34:42  <a1k0n> i can make a sandbox on app.a1k0n.net; it'll be extremely limited in RAM though

2010-09-11T23:36:05  <rogue780__> amstan, nevermind about that problem. It was PBKAC

2010-09-11T23:37:39  <amstan> stop trying to offer nodes
2010-09-11T23:37:44  <dstufft> i don't use mysql for my projects, so im installing the mysql server
2010-09-11T23:37:53  <dstufft> i'll offer a node b/c i don't care if i compete :p
2010-09-11T23:37:58  <a1k0n> i'm not offering a node, i'm offering a site sandbox to test patches on

2010-09-11T23:38:10  <amstan> a1k0n: why do you call it sandbox?
2010-09-11T23:38:23  <jmcarthur> because it's a place to play around
2010-09-11T23:38:25  <a1k0n> i dunno, that's the term that's typically used.
2010-09-11T23:38:30  <jmcarthur> sandbox is overloaded

2010-09-11T23:39:44  <a1k0n> making a branch for someone else's code, then reviewing it, and then committing it to trunk seems to be within the rules but is silly

2010-09-11T23:42:36  <drewrobb> deepblue: your bot is really nice

2010-09-11T23:42:49  <dstufft> amstan: off hand how do i configure the site to point to a certain db
2010-09-11T23:43:07  <jmcarthur> caytchen: you just made me wtf
2010-09-11T23:43:15  <deepblue> now i have to teach him to know the enemies move before he knows it himself #include <timemachine.h>
2010-09-11T23:43:21  <drewrobb> i must have overfitted my bot, it wins %90 against v0.2
2010-09-11T23:43:58  <td123> anyone using any ml algorithms?
2010-09-11T23:44:00  <deepblue> i have the problem that my current version looses against my older version but my older version looses against many other bots Oo
2010-09-11T23:44:07  <a1k0n> drewrobb: well 0.31 does seem objectively better than 0.2
2010-09-11T23:44:07  <drewrobb> just use pw.GoBackATurn()
2010-09-11T23:44:16  <deepblue> hehe
2010-09-11T23:44:36  <deepblue> yeah while I was gone 0.31 did some great games against my bot
2010-09-11T23:44:44  <a1k0n> td123: thinking about it!  no code yet.
2010-09-11T23:44:45  <amstan> dstufft: in www/ http://pastebin.com/VyqrVaDz
2010-09-11T23:44:47  <drewrobb> a1k0n: yeah, but it gets destroyed by you and deepblue
2010-09-11T23:44:53  <JensT1> td123: not yet, but planning for a reservoir
2010-09-11T23:44:55  <Zannick> jmp_buf delorean;
2010-09-11T23:45:03  <amstan> dstufft: you have to create it
2010-09-11T23:45:10  <deepblue> lol
2010-09-11T23:45:15  <a1k0n> drewrobb: not necessarily against mine..
2010-09-11T23:45:28  <td123> are you guys that planning on implementing ml going to use neural networks?
2010-09-11T23:45:32  <a1k0n> no way
2010-09-11T23:46:10  <JensT1> td123: yep, as I just said, planning on using a reservoir to predict the oponents next move and countermove it
2010-09-11T23:46:20  <deepblue> I don't think neural networks will be a good approach here
2010-09-11T23:46:36  <antimatroid1> i think many things will be a good approach
2010-09-11T23:46:37  <a1k0n> JensT1: what do you mean by a reservior?
2010-09-11T23:46:37  <antimatroid1> i love it
2010-09-11T23:46:49  <a1k0n> i've never heard that term in this context
2010-09-11T23:47:04  <drewrobb> i wonder what win percentage the final bots will have against these current top bots
2010-09-11T23:47:29  <amstan> i can't believe i just did this to count users in here: http://pastebin.com/AGbQNc58
2010-09-11T23:47:30  <jmcarthur> who's doing ml?
2010-09-11T23:47:35  <JensT1> a1k0n: it's a recurrent neural network with random internal weights, with 1 or 2 output layers. where you train the output layer
2010-09-11T23:47:36  <a1k0n> my ML thought is determining a probability distribution that an enemy will send N ships to planet X on turn Y
2010-09-11T23:47:47  <JensT1> http://www.reservoir-computing.org/
2010-09-11T23:47:58  <a1k0n> JensT1: huh, interesting
2010-09-11T23:47:59  <jmcarthur> amstan: your client doesn't report that dor you?
2010-09-11T23:48:06  <deepblue> mmh
2010-09-11T23:48:11  <deepblue> quite interesting
2010-09-11T23:48:12  <caytchen> are neural nets and other things really a option here?
2010-09-11T23:48:14  <JensT1> it's good at time prediction
2010-09-11T23:48:14  <amstan> jmcarthur: idk how, you're welcome to tell me, i use konversation
2010-09-11T23:48:24  <jmcarthur> ah, not familiar with it
2010-09-11T23:48:25  <caytchen> i mean it doesn't look like you'll be able to keep persistent data
2010-09-11T23:48:31  <jmcarthur> i'm not a KDE/Qt guy
2010-09-11T23:48:35  <Appleman1234> amstan, rofl, my client tells me that information
2010-09-11T23:48:43  <deepblue> well you have to train it before you submit it
2010-09-11T23:49:02  <a1k0n> and you can train it by downloading other peoples' games.
2010-09-11T23:49:11  <deepblue> true
2010-09-11T23:49:12  <caytchen> ah okay
2010-09-11T23:49:14  <caytchen> didn't think of that
2010-09-11T23:49:23  <amstan> caytchen: also.. tcp server
2010-09-11T23:49:30  <deepblue> you could download all my games and train it to play perfect against me

2010-09-11T23:50:04  <ulope> amstan: I just had an idea re. people running nodes not beeing allowed to compete: What if the nodes run inside a vm that the organizers choose a root pw for and the bot files only get uploaded to /dev/shm (i.e. "ram disk") this way the server owner can't access the files and also mounting the image outside of the vm doesn't help because the bots are not stored on disk

2010-09-11T23:50:33  <JensT1> deepblue: yep, and the organisers wouldn't really be able to tell we do player specific behaviour
2010-09-11T23:50:44  <jmcarthur> ulope: i hacked vms at my last job. it's easy

2010-09-11T23:50:58  <deepblue> well it's not about player specific behaviour
2010-09-11T23:51:07  <jmcarthur> ulope: even (especially) to read stuff in memory
2010-09-11T23:51:09  <JensT1> since it's a bit to complicated to trac back where what decision came from
2010-09-11T23:51:15  <deepblue> it's just to counter good strategie
2010-09-11T23:51:24  <amstan> computerwiz_222: you're probably the lowest class compwiz here
2010-09-11T23:51:27  <amstan> computerwiz_222: lol
2010-09-11T23:51:34  <JensT1> deepblue: just training for 1bot would make it very specific
2010-09-11T23:51:36  <jmcarthur> ulope: (the project was in-memory forensics on a live system)
2010-09-11T23:51:38  <dstufft> nginx: http://ai.dstufft.com/
2010-09-11T23:51:40  <computerwiz_222> amstan: scum
2010-09-11T23:51:41  <ulope> jmcarthur: Hm... yeah I guess you could use a debugger to peek into the process memory
2010-09-11T23:51:45  <amstan> computerwiz_222: tims?
2010-09-11T23:51:45  <JensT1> it would fail hard against any other probably ifyou really over fit it
2010-09-11T23:51:51  <deepblue> yes
2010-09-11T23:51:58  <deepblue> you would only be able to beat me :)
2010-09-11T23:52:06  <computerwiz_222> amstan: YOUR THE LOWEST CLASS OF COMPUTERWIZ! lol :P
2010-09-11T23:52:14  <amstan> computerwiz_222: #hypertriangle if you want some quiet
2010-09-11T23:52:19  <ulope> amstan: But then the question is: what is people running nodes stopping from simply signing up under a different name
2010-09-11T23:52:19  <deepblue> which would give you a nice elo score on the tcp server right now ;)
2010-09-11T23:52:44  <amstan> ulope: what is stopping me from singing up under a different name?
2010-09-11T23:52:45  <deepblue> what do you guys mean with 'nodes'?
2010-09-11T23:52:49  <jmcarthur> ulope: the basic assumption that anybody in the field of security has to make is that if they have the hardware and it's running, you can't do anything to stop it
2010-09-11T23:53:01  <JensT1> amstan: nothing, you can even reuse your mail adress
2010-09-11T23:53:02  <amstan> deepblue: decentralization
2010-09-11T23:53:05  <amstan> deepblue: see topic
2010-09-11T23:53:11  <dstufft> j3camero: still here?
2010-09-11T23:53:18  <amstan> dstufft: he'll be back in 30 min
2010-09-11T23:53:24  <jmcarthur> even non-running hardware can be cracked if you have *all* the hardware
2010-09-11T23:53:34  <dstufft> amstan: ok, the site is up and running on my vps under nginx
2010-09-11T23:53:41  <ulope> amstan: Exactly thats my point. If you have to trust that people don't sign up under another name whats the point of excluding them in the first place
2010-09-11T23:53:42  <jmcarthur> dstufft: that was fast!
2010-09-11T23:53:42  <caytchen> okay whats that http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284262763|caytchen|drewrobb0.31 heh

2010-09-11T23:53:46  <deepblue> uh
2010-09-11T23:53:48  <deepblue> ok
2010-09-11T23:53:57  <dstufft> jmcarthur: i do it for a living :p
2010-09-11T23:54:02  <dstufft> well sort of
2010-09-11T23:54:05  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-11T23:54:10  <amstan> ulope: that rule is in place mostly because of winners
2010-09-11T23:54:12  <deepblue> i don't want my code on other peoples server :/
2010-09-11T23:54:16  <dstufft> i techincally write web apps for a living
2010-09-11T23:54:42  <amstan> ulope: if you're contributing somehow we will have your identity, and if you win we will as well(if you want prizes)
2010-09-11T23:54:48  <amstan> ulope: if those match, you're disqualified
2010-09-11T23:54:57  <jmcarthur> when your server is under heavy load, there's nothing quite like a userbase of developers
2010-09-11T23:55:03  <JensT1> dstufft: this is how I did it
2010-09-11T23:55:04  <JensT1> https://zeus.ugent.be/wiki/Aichallenge
2010-09-11T23:55:13  <JensT1> maybe put something like that on the wiki?
2010-09-11T23:55:23  <ulope> amstan: Sure. I'm just hypothesizing here
2010-09-11T23:55:40  <dstufft> JensT1: ?
2010-09-11T23:55:56  <JensT1> seting up a seperate site
2010-09-11T23:55:58  <dstufft> but yea techinally a web dev, but since i run my own business i do the sys admining too
2010-09-11T23:56:04  <amstan> JensT1: he's done already, also:
2010-09-11T23:56:10  <dstufft> JensT1: oh this site is just a test site to make sure it all works fine on nginx
2010-09-11T23:56:11  <amstan> contestbot: @what sampledb
2010-09-11T23:56:12  <contestbot> amstan: Error: "@what" is not a valid command.
2010-09-11T23:56:18  <drewrobb> caytchen: the center means nothing to me!
2010-09-11T23:56:20  <amstan> contestbot: where sampledb
2010-09-11T23:56:20  <contestbot> amstan: sampledb = http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/sample.sql
2010-09-11T23:56:26  <amstan> JensT1: that ^^^
2010-09-11T23:56:31  <dstufft> amstan: is there a user/pw in the sampledb i can login with
2010-09-11T23:56:35  <JensT1> that would have been handy

2010-09-11T23:56:48  <JensT1> since I reverse engineerd the db scheme and contents
2010-09-11T23:57:02  <dstufft> amstan: ok
2010-09-11T23:57:13  <dstufft> fwiw that nginx server is using apc cache too
2010-09-11T23:57:24  <dstufft> which is a speed up if you arnt using an opcode cache
2010-09-11T23:57:37  <amstan> JensT1: i think i did it after you've setup your site
2010-09-11T23:57:53  <dstufft> and suhosin patch too
2010-09-11T23:58:00  <amstan> dstufft: ok.. good work, can you write a wiki article about it?
2010-09-11T23:58:02  <dstufft> security++
2010-09-11T23:58:04  <amstan> dstufft: and then make an issue?
2010-09-11T23:58:21  <amstan> dstufft: also.. what's suhosin patch? i never found out what it meant
