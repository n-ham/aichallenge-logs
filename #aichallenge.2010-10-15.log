2010-10-15T00:01:36  <Azrathud> Congrats dmj.
2010-10-15T00:02:05  <amstan_> dmj111: ya!
2010-10-15T00:03:28  <dmj111> amstan_: thanks guys.

2010-10-15T00:03:37  <dmj111> Azrathud: both...
2010-10-15T00:03:38  <amstan_> dmj111: new bot version?
2010-10-15T00:04:17  <dmj111> kind of.  it is a little experimental.  it even crashes (look at its first loss :/ )
2010-10-15T00:04:47  <amstan_> any hints on how it works?
2010-10-15T00:05:12  <dmj111> its not too complicated...
2010-10-15T00:05:15  * dmj111 is typing more
2010-10-15T00:05:17  <amstan_> wow! second place guy is romanian
2010-10-15T00:05:35  <amstan_> yes! http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5881697
2010-10-15T00:05:37  <amstan_> epic battle
2010-10-15T00:06:32  <dmj111> yeah, that one is pretty amusing.  I almost feel bad getting a win for it though.
2010-10-15T00:07:11  <amstan_> a1k0n is nowhere to be seen?
2010-10-15T00:07:16  <amstan_> a1k0n: did you give up?
2010-10-15T00:07:16  <dmj111> My bot does little more than only take what it can take, and defend what it can defend.   One of its weaknesses is that it is too conservative on the attack.
2010-10-15T00:07:55  <dmj111> So, this version has some code it in to realize that it doesn't need to defend each planet with only the ships at the planet.  They can defend each other.
2010-10-15T00:08:19  <dmj111> but, the code is ugly, and it is not clear I got it right.
2010-10-15T00:08:26  <amstan_> lol
2010-10-15T00:08:50  <amstan_> aww, there's no way to get submission id from the website
2010-10-15T00:08:51  <dmj111> i am waiting for a1k0n to unleash a monster at some point.  although, I am thankful for minecraft.
2010-10-15T00:08:54  <amstan_> phpmyadmin is too much work
2010-10-15T00:09:06  <amstan_> lol
2010-10-15T00:09:18  <amstan_> dmj111: i have a hunch he gave up
2010-10-15T00:09:24  <amstan_> maybe he does not want more glory
2010-10-15T00:09:49  <dmj111> once you've won one... what more do you need to prove :)
2010-10-15T00:09:58  <amstan_> yeah, pretty much
2010-10-15T00:10:17  <dmj111> he just dominated that final tournament... it was amazing.
2010-10-15T00:10:40  <amstan_> i wish we had contestbot then
2010-10-15T00:10:43  <amstan_> to log everything
2010-10-15T00:11:06  <amstan_> maybe i can digg up my logs from #googleai
2010-10-15T00:11:15  <amstan_> dmj111: did you participate in the other one?
2010-10-15T00:11:19  <dmj111> i never even lurked back then.  I wish I would have... listening/talking on irc has been the best part of this.
2010-10-15T00:11:46  <dmj111> I did.  I even led, briefly.  I think I was one of the earlier voronoi adopters.
2010-10-15T00:11:54  <dmj111> Then, everyone else figured it out better.
2010-10-15T00:11:56  <dmj111> and boom.
2010-10-15T00:13:06  <amstan_> yeah, actually.. last term the channel was 1/3 of the size
2010-10-15T00:13:13  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2010-10-15T00:13:54  <dmj111> ohh... tell me you aren't going to do this each term.  I have spend too much time on this ...
2010-10-15T00:14:11  <amstan> it would be cool
2010-10-15T00:15:26  <dmj111> well, take it easy. I haven't slept much the last few weeks... so I better head off.
2010-10-15T00:15:38  <amstan> good night

2010-10-15T00:22:57  <amstan> dmj111: you know what should be done for the next contest? something that will have to get you addicted to minecraft first..
2010-10-15T00:23:01  <amstan> like a minecraft AI
2010-10-15T00:23:24  <amstan> so contestants will have to deal with the addiction to minecraft while making their bot
2010-10-15T00:23:27  <amstan> that is diabolical
2010-10-15T00:23:37  <bhasker> evening folks
2010-10-15T00:23:49  <amstan> bhasker: it's just me actually, talking to myself
2010-10-15T00:23:58  <bhasker> lol
2010-10-15T00:23:58  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-15T00:26:12  <Zannick> o/
2010-10-15T00:26:25  <amstan> so.. let's talk! everyone! lol
2010-10-15T00:26:54  <Zannick> i was going to work a lot on my bot today...
2010-10-15T00:27:02  <amstan> aww
2010-10-15T00:27:07  <amstan> i'm lonely then
2010-10-15T00:27:17  <Zannick> but then i sat down at the computer and was like...ugh...
2010-10-15T00:27:28  <Zannick> maybe saturday
2010-10-15T00:27:31  <Zannick> :P
2010-10-15T00:28:08  <Zannick> if i don't have a working bot by november it'll be my fault
2010-10-15T00:28:08  <amstan> Zannick: did you see "the social network"?
2010-10-15T00:28:24  <Zannick> i think i'm going to see it tomorrow
2010-10-15T00:28:39  <Zannick> i've heard some things already
2010-10-15T00:28:39  <amstan> Zannick: make sure you watch it at the beginning of the day
2010-10-15T00:28:53  <amstan> after you watch it, you'll be in perfect mood to program
2010-10-15T00:28:56  <amstan> it's magical
2010-10-15T00:29:00  <Zannick> heh
2010-10-15T00:29:08  <amstan> you'll be like, zomg! code code!
2010-10-15T00:29:14  <Zannick> program what, is the question
2010-10-15T00:29:21  <amstan> that's your problem, lol
2010-10-15T00:29:25  * Zannick has so many projects besides this one :P
2010-10-15T00:29:35  <amstan> like what?
2010-10-15T00:30:05  <Azrathud> The current rankings don't show up on Firefox but they do on Chromium.
2010-10-15T00:30:13  <amstan> Azrathud: fun stuff
2010-10-15T00:30:23  <amstan> they work in contest bot, so it's all good
2010-10-15T00:30:24  <Zannick> my own irc bot, a roguelike, and some other things
2010-10-15T00:30:36  <amstan> Zannick: irc bot you say?
2010-10-15T00:31:00  <Zannick> aye
2010-10-15T00:31:06  <amstan> tell me more
2010-10-15T00:31:08  <amstan> #moar
2010-10-15T00:31:09  <contestbot> amstan: Error: You haven't asked me a command; perhaps you want to see someone else's more.  To do so, call this command with that person's nick.
2010-10-15T00:31:59  <Zannick> it is a pretty basic thing acting as a joke repository
2010-10-15T00:32:31  <amstan> you should work on bot technologies then
2010-10-15T00:32:36  <antimatroid> Zannick: I have 5 units on top of this and my side project
2010-10-15T00:32:49  <amstan> bot technologies i say!
2010-10-15T00:32:52  <Zannick> i am very much interested in ai
2010-10-15T00:32:53  <antimatroid> plus i've been audting post grad measure theory :|
2010-10-15T00:33:19  <amstan> everyone needs to have a bot!
2010-10-15T00:33:23  * amstan looks at contestbot
2010-10-15T00:33:33  <antimatroid> i'm going to implement a minimax bot this weekend and see how it goes
2010-10-15T00:33:49  <amstan> antimatroid: was the feasible then?
2010-10-15T00:33:49  <antimatroid> i need to rewrite a lot of my backend to do it properly though
2010-10-15T00:34:02  <antimatroid> was the feasible what?
2010-10-15T00:34:07  <amstan> minimax
2010-10-15T00:34:20  <antimatroid> it's not going to be an exhaustive tree at each layer
2010-10-15T00:34:22  <amstan> s/the/that/
2010-10-15T00:34:23  <Zannick> maybe i should implement the simpler idea before the more complicated one...
2010-10-15T00:34:25  <antimatroid> but i expect to to do well if set up properly
2010-10-15T00:34:34  <antimatroid> too simple and it'll suck
2010-10-15T00:34:47  <Zannick> at least it'll be something that runs!
2010-10-15T00:35:05  <Zannick> copybot doesn't count
2010-10-15T00:35:16  <amstan> i was thinking about abstracting ships and stuff
2010-10-15T00:35:21  <amstan> don't think of such low levels
2010-10-15T00:35:37  <amstan> abstract to things like, waves, attacks
2010-10-15T00:35:49  <amstan> don't leave planets undefended
2010-10-15T00:35:50  <amstan> and all that
2010-10-15T00:35:52  <antimatroid> nah, you need to handle the micro side of things
2010-10-15T00:35:55  <antimatroid> or else you'll get trampled
2010-10-15T00:36:12  <Zannick> i had an idea wherein i would program a bot that knew nothing but would learn from watching games and analyzing strategies
2010-10-15T00:36:24  <amstan> Zannick: been done, neural networks
2010-10-15T00:36:33  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-15T00:36:45  <Zannick> but really hard for me since i have no experience in that sort of thing
2010-10-15T00:36:47  <amstan> topic for it: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=486
2010-10-15T00:36:54  <amstan> i was thinking about it
2010-10-15T00:37:10  <amstan> could be done
2010-10-15T00:37:15  <amstan> with proper inputs and outputs
2010-10-15T00:37:34  <antimatroid> i have never been able to find a decent coverage of neural networks
2010-10-15T00:37:47  <amstan> inputs could be... major incoming fleets, enemy planet size, closest enemy planet
2010-10-15T00:37:50  <antimatroid> do you guys know anywhere on the net that would satisfy the standards expected of a maths student?
2010-10-15T00:38:01  <amstan> outputs could be: attack biggest enemy planet, defent base being attacked
2010-10-15T00:38:04  <amstan> defend*
2010-10-15T00:38:20  <amstan> antimatroid: i saw a guide somewhere
2010-10-15T00:38:22  <amstan> idk about guides
2010-10-15T00:38:25  <amstan> hold on
2010-10-15T00:39:13  <antimatroid> i don't want a guide, i want to know the maths behind nueral networks
2010-10-15T00:39:31  <amstan> http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs486/
2010-10-15T00:39:35  <antimatroid> cheers
2010-10-15T00:39:38  <amstan> there's a book on it
2010-10-15T00:39:43  <amstan> maybe you can aquire it
2010-10-15T00:39:53  <amstan> pretty sure it has neural networks

2010-10-15T00:41:16  <amstan> the mutation part seems the most complicated

2010-10-15T00:48:19  <antimatroid> pitty the guy goes easy on the maths, it's very hard to find a coverage of neural networks with the maths, everyone seems to want to do it without it :|

2010-10-15T01:04:09  <rwa> antimatroid:  that maths... there isn't much
2010-10-15T01:04:19  <rwa> the maths...
2010-10-15T01:04:34  <antimatroid> rwa: i still prefer to do things properly
2010-10-15T01:04:47  <rwa> NN are little more than a function fitting procedure
2010-10-15T01:05:03  <sigh> the only non-trivial part is the back propagation, no?
2010-10-15T01:05:08  <sigh> I can't recall it being that hard
2010-10-15T01:05:13  <antimatroid> i've never really looked at them
2010-10-15T01:05:16  <foucist> antimatroid: nn isn't about math, not really
2010-10-15T01:06:25  <sigh> foucist: that's an odd statement... what do you mean?
2010-10-15T01:06:26  <antimatroid> from wikipedia "The perceptron is essentially a linear classifier for classifying data  specified by parameters  and an output function f = w'x + b. Its parameters are adapted with an ad-hoc rule similar to stochastic steepest gradient descent. Because the inner product is a linear operator in the input space"
2010-10-15T01:06:32  <antimatroid> along those lines is what i'm looking for
2010-10-15T01:08:31  <antimatroid> i think i have a pretty good idea of how to do my game tree anyway, hopefully that will work well
2010-10-15T01:08:31  <sigh> how about this (I just followed links from wikipedia): http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol4/cs11/report.html#Appendix%20B%20-%20The%20back-propagation%20Algorithm%20-%20a%20mathematical%20approach
2010-10-15T01:08:42  <antimatroid> i'm still going to work out how to try and train the parameters though
2010-10-15T01:09:41  <Zannick> good luck
2010-10-15T01:09:44  <rwa> I'm not quite ready to try to train parameters yet, but when I am, I know exactly how I'm going to do it
2010-10-15T01:09:51  <Zannick> i am :o at the entire idea
2010-10-15T01:10:05  <Zannick> no idea how to do it without running millions of games
2010-10-15T01:10:22  <sigh> what's wrong with running millions of games?
2010-10-15T01:10:36  <rwa> nothing unless you can do the same with thousands of games
2010-10-15T01:10:41  <antimatroid> we're intending to do it once we have the tree etc. going, i suspect we'll take parameters as inputs from a file and just update them there, then write a program to just test lots of parameters etc. against each other, the fine details are still very vague though
2010-10-15T01:10:42  <sigh> sure
2010-10-15T01:10:43  <Zannick> i'm just going to entertain myself watching these minesweeper tanks
2010-10-15T01:11:13  <antimatroid> minesweeper is one of my favourite games, it's incredibly underated

2010-10-15T01:19:26  <antimatroid> terrible idea
2010-10-15T01:19:34  <Zannick> it was an interesting idea
2010-10-15T01:19:45  <sigh> it worked well when no one else was redistributing ships
2010-10-15T01:19:57  <antimatroid> someone else mentioned building convex hulls that kept trying to increase their area
2010-10-15T01:20:00  <sigh> any sort of supply chain is better than none
2010-10-15T01:20:05  <sigh> bhasker I think
2010-10-15T01:20:07  <antimatroid> that was sort of cool, but again i don't think it would work very well
2010-10-15T01:20:23  <bhasker> i was thinking of it
2010-10-15T01:20:26  <bhasker> but didnt do it
2010-10-15T01:20:29  <sigh> I was right!
2010-10-15T01:20:47  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be surprised if there was quite a few :P
2010-10-15T01:20:58  <sigh> quite a few what?
2010-10-15T01:20:59  <bhasker> i was not really looking at using a convex hull to increase the area but more as an influence area
2010-10-15T01:21:01  <rwa> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=495698
2010-10-15T01:21:06  <bhasker> to identify the edges where i should flow my ships too
2010-10-15T01:21:07  <rwa> this is sort of a tree bot
2010-10-15T01:21:32  <antimatroid> what makes you say that?
2010-10-15T01:21:39  <antimatroid> oh wait, nevermind
2010-10-15T01:21:50  <antimatroid> so is it working reasonable well?
2010-10-15T01:21:54  <rwa> eh
2010-10-15T01:22:00  <antimatroid> are you using A*? and what about alpha-beta?
2010-10-15T01:22:06  <antimatroid> i'm not sure about the second
2010-10-15T01:22:08  <rwa> it is beating some strong bots, but also losing to weak bots
2010-10-15T01:22:09  <antimatroid> intend to use the first
2010-10-15T01:22:25  <antimatroid> are you going lots of moves at each layer? that's my intention
2010-10-15T01:23:01  <antimatroid> and i'm storing states for extendable nodes, and a whole tree, but not game state info for already processed nodes, despite what people on here advised :P
2010-10-15T01:23:20  <rwa> I am not using either right now
2010-10-15T01:23:37  <antimatroid> is memory an issue too? it wasn't for tron even when storing the tree, i think it is for this though
2010-10-15T01:23:47  <sigh> I'm not sure how A* is applicable for searching the game state
2010-10-15T01:23:54  <rwa> no, my tree is not big enough to be a problem with mem

2010-10-15T01:36:25  <antimatroid> i have to start getting ready for exams soon, so if i don't get it up and running before the end of the weekend, it's going to take me a while
2010-10-15T01:37:31  <sigh> exams are only what, 3hrs? plenty of time left for working on your bot
2010-10-15T01:37:40  <antimatroid> i have 5 of them :P
2010-10-15T01:38:03  <antimatroid> and analysis, pdes, and topics in adv. maths aren't going to be walks in the park
2010-10-15T01:38:24  <antimatroid> the other two, yeah probably
2010-10-15T01:38:30  <sigh> :P
2010-10-15T01:39:07  <sigh> PDEs is a final year subject?
2010-10-15T01:39:32  <antimatroid> yeah, and it was very much more of an applied physics unit, have hated it
2010-10-15T01:39:47  <antimatroid> i can't stand applied maths, it's a lot of grunt work for no fun, i'm doing all pure units for honours
2010-10-15T01:39:53  <sigh> haha
2010-10-15T01:40:16  <antimatroid> yet i constantly do the most tedious things for fun while programming stuff, go figure
2010-10-15T01:40:57  <sigh> well, a computer is closer to pure maths than the physical world
2010-10-15T01:41:03  <rwa> I'm the opposite.  Any article that starts with something like "Consider a compact operator on a Hilbert space" goes directly into the round file.
2010-10-15T01:41:32  <antimatroid> i've only just learnt about hilbert spaces this semester, so still a bit shaky
2010-10-15T01:41:53  <rwa> Don't waste my time with that sh7t, what problem are you trying to solve?  I don't care about your pseudo-art.
2010-10-15T01:41:56  <antimatroid> i'm constantly amazed at how much von neumann did
2010-10-15T01:42:12  <antimatroid> rwa: analysis and algebra were my two favourite undergrad units :P
2010-10-15T01:42:18  <rwa> Von Neumann was an absolute genius for sure
2010-10-15T01:42:33  <antimatroid> he did two degrees simultaneously
2010-10-15T01:43:01  <antimatroid> i swear that's impossible, i have done 5 officially this semester, plus lectures and some assignments for measure and ai, and i have not had a spare second
2010-10-15T01:43:07  <antimatroid> he did that for a good 3 years
2010-10-15T01:43:43  <sigh> you still have enough time for this contest... your work load is not very high
2010-10-15T01:43:45  <sigh> :P
2010-10-15T01:44:01  <antimatroid> you should see the quality of some of the assignments i handed in :P
2010-10-15T01:44:13  <sigh> :)
2010-10-15T01:44:14  <antimatroid> here's for high weighted exams saving my life
2010-10-15T01:44:24  <sigh> how much do the exams count for/
2010-10-15T01:44:41  <antimatroid> 70-80%
2010-10-15T01:44:47  <sigh> yeah, that's not too bad
2010-10-15T01:45:23  <antimatroid> i shouldn't even be passing computer graphics, haven't been to a class since first week and my assignments were dreadful, but our school for that here is that terrible
2010-10-15T01:46:50  <sigh> meh, if you are a math student computer graphics should be easy
2010-10-15T01:47:02  <sigh> it's just basic linear algebra
2010-10-15T01:47:47  <antimatroid> you haven't seen what i handed in as assignments, they were all about using a pre written engine like a black box, the school sucks, they're entirely math averse
2010-10-15T01:48:06  <sigh> ah :(
2010-10-15T01:48:13  <antimatroid> an exam question is likely to be write a function for multiplying two 3x3 matrices, i mean a third year unit, come on
2010-10-15T01:48:24  <sigh> anyway, I've been informed there's free food nearby... cya

2010-10-15T02:27:38  <antimatroid> yeah, don't think i've done single digits yet, well done
2010-10-15T02:27:43  <antimatroid> i have done under 20
2010-10-15T02:28:06  <McLeopold_> So, because of a logging error, I have a lot of losses with games under 10 turns.
2010-10-15T02:28:27  <antimatroid> i was referring to legitimate wins :P
2010-10-15T02:28:38  <McLeopold_> My bot looks very impressive against who I'm playing.

2010-10-15T02:28:58  <antimatroid> is this the knapsack like bot?

2010-10-15T02:29:20  <McLeopold_> Kinda?
2010-10-15T02:29:31  <McLeopold_> Not really.
2010-10-15T02:29:40  <antimatroid> i've just cleaned out a copy of mine for a complete clean then minimax attempt
2010-10-15T02:30:03  <McLeopold_> The knapsack problem is fun to solve, but not totally applicable to this game.
2010-10-15T02:30:30  <antimatroid> yeah, but it's similar in concept to picking planets to send ships too
2010-10-15T02:30:38  <antimatroid> if not entirely the same

2010-10-15T02:30:44  <McLeopold_> This bot has growth management and super defense.
2010-10-15T02:30:59  <McLeopold_> It's meant to barely win.
2010-10-15T02:31:11  <antimatroid> yeah, i prioritise defense over anything in my heuristic got, and i have tried to cut back on expanding
2010-10-15T02:31:58  <McLeopold_> This bot also tries really hard to steal planets.

2010-10-15T02:33:34  <antimatroid> my official entry atm seems to suck
2010-10-15T02:34:16  <McLeopold_> if you hammer their front lines, they make more mistakes, or overcommit to defense.
2010-10-15T02:35:20  <McLeopold_> At first I though abandoning planets was a bad idea, but I'm beginning to think it may be useful.  I have to do more calculations.

2010-10-15T05:56:36  <davidd> hello
2010-10-15T06:00:26  <davidd> According to http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php, there are no cloud servers running at the moment. All cloud servers "died" yesterday and never came back up, so there is only a single slow server playing games (only 5-6 games per minute for thousands of bots).
2010-10-15T06:00:37  <davidd> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=926 <- any news on this"?

2010-10-15T06:02:17  <davidd> why after reuploading your code is your ranking reset to unranked, instead of leaving it around the level of your last upload?

2010-10-15T06:24:29  <Frontier> davidd: The way the elo score works it seemed straight forward to put every new entry in the middle and watch it climb or fall. Someone said he might be doing something about it. But with the recent rate of changes I don't think that will happen ^^.

2010-10-15T06:27:07  <Frontier> I bet if they made it so you start at say 30 your entry will still jump a lot, maybe even far above rank 1 for a while until the score becomes more reliable.

2010-10-15T08:50:35  <antimatroid> i'm making game tree atm
2010-10-15T08:50:52  <antimatroid> but i'm setting it up to only pick a certain number of moves at each node

2010-10-15T08:53:22  <phreeza> antimatroid: if that works it would be really cool... the tricky thing is which moves to choose i guess
2010-10-15T08:54:44  <phreeza> i was thinking of doing that and just choosing moves at random but i have a feeling that won't do...

2010-10-15T08:56:44  <antimatroid> it's basically trying to do a mix of good moves favouring different things, and mixing up selections of some
2010-10-15T08:59:12  <phreeza> I have the skeleton of a c++ bot with game tree search, but it doesn't really do anything at the moment. and i have my python bot which is a bag of heuristics. maybe i'll work some more on the game tree one, too
2010-10-15T08:59:53  <phreeza> and try to come up with a smarter selection criterion
2010-10-15T09:01:23  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3488), MariusCG(3474), felixcoto(3419), Hazard(3384), rsergio(3374), deepblue(3373), evja08(3349), EBraun(3347), ruilov(3291), ofrias(3290)
2010-10-15T09:01:36  <antimatroid> yeah, mine is in c++, it's like 3/4 constructed, but i expect to have a huge amount of debugging too
2010-10-15T09:01:46  <antimatroid> i can't really incrementally code it other than check that it compiles
2010-10-15T09:01:52  <davidd> i have watched a few games of deepblue
2010-10-15T09:02:00  <davidd> i think it is the favorite atm
2010-10-15T09:02:07  <davidd> at the moment rabidus
2010-10-15T09:02:25  <antimatroid> i don't think much can be said yet, i'm pretty sure all bots are still heuristic based
2010-10-15T09:02:48  <antimatroid> some people seem to be testing out some ideas finally though
2010-10-15T09:02:53  <davidd> have you watched the top bots?
2010-10-15T09:03:00  <phreeza> albert is doing game tree search i think but it sucks a lot more than his old heuristics bot
2010-10-15T09:03:04  <antimatroid> not recently admitidly
2010-10-15T09:03:15  <Error323> so am I :(
2010-10-15T09:03:19  <rabidus> if i just could write into file @ server......
2010-10-15T09:03:22  <Error323> its not working out yet lalala
2010-10-15T09:03:32  <davidd> i decided against alpha beta because it assumes you have a small number of possible moves
2010-10-15T09:03:37  <phreeza> Error323: searching the tree?
2010-10-15T09:03:46  <Error323> phreeza: yeah, alpha beta
2010-10-15T09:04:18  <sigh> if you are thinking of choosing moves at random you might want to look at the UCT algorithm
2010-10-15T09:04:21  <phreeza> how deep do you get?
2010-10-15T09:04:38  <phreeza> sigh: yea thats what i am planning to do
2010-10-15T09:04:45  <Error323> well, a more interesting and difficult question is how many actions are there :P
2010-10-15T09:04:53  <Error323> the branching factor is massive
2010-10-15T09:04:58  <sigh> phreeza: cool, interesting to see how it turns out
2010-10-15T09:05:07  <sigh> phreeza: have you used that algorithm before?
2010-10-15T09:05:11  <phreeza> sigh: with some offline knowledge though, i think vanilla will still not work
2010-10-15T09:05:14  <Error323> but atm depth 2-3
2010-10-15T09:05:22  <phreeza> nope
2010-10-15T09:05:32  <Error323> however i'm ranked somewhere around 3K lol cuz the timer is set too agressive
2010-10-15T09:05:38  <Error323> but I'm rethinking some stuff
2010-10-15T09:05:42  <phreeza> Error323: ah thats a shame
2010-10-15T09:05:52  <aerique> delt0r___: JBotManager replays have become visually very pleasing :)
2010-10-15T09:06:09  <phreeza> so you time out mostly or don't calculate enough?
2010-10-15T09:06:22  <Error323> i currently timeout every time
2010-10-15T09:06:27  <phreeza> sigh: have you used it before?
2010-10-15T09:06:32  <antimatroid> Error323: how many moves are you considering at each node?
2010-10-15T09:06:58  <Error323> well that is a good question ;)
2010-10-15T09:07:00  <antimatroid> a1k0n was getting like 30 layers with tron, albeit less moves still quite deep
2010-10-15T09:07:07  <Error323> but I cant share everything :P
2010-10-15T09:07:20  <phreeza> sigh: theres an open source Go engine that uses it... was consdering maybe using some of their code
2010-10-15T09:07:52  <phreeza> or at least see what optimizations they have

2010-10-15T11:35:35  <rebelxt> quote on runner-up bot: "The bot uses primarily states machines to make decisions and it can recognize the strategy of its opponent."
2010-10-15T11:36:03  <amstan> i have no idea about cloud servers
2010-10-15T11:36:14  <phreeza> rebelxt: pdf you mean the presentation?
2010-10-15T11:36:28  <phreeza> or the UCT paper i posted earlier?
2010-10-15T11:36:35  <rebelxt> phreeza: yeah, linked on the page you posted a link to
2010-10-15T11:37:04  <phreeza> aha, well yea the info was a bit sparse, haven't had any time to look for more detailed descriptions
2010-10-15T11:38:02  <phreeza> i think many of the top heuristic bots now also use state machines, perhaps implicitly
2010-10-15T11:38:04  <rebelxt> yeah, slide 8 of http://eis.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/AIIDECompetition.pdf is a great list of AI techniques bots had to use

2010-10-15T11:40:56  <phreeza> so sniping for example would be a script in our case?

2010-10-15T12:46:28  <phreeza> That map is to produce an RPS situation?

2010-10-15T12:46:46  <McLeopold> phreeze: yes, or close to it
2010-10-15T12:47:18  <McLeopold> it's more of an odd/even contest
2010-10-15T12:47:40  <McLeopold> with the option to not throw a number
2010-10-15T12:48:34  <jmcarthur> i'm gonna spend a little time on this
2010-10-15T12:49:03  <phreeza> wow
2010-10-15T12:49:27  <McLeopold> I may need to put a neutral in the center
2010-10-15T12:49:29  <phreeza> i'm not familiar with that game exactly
2010-10-15T12:49:49  <phreeza> but i can imagine
2010-10-15T12:49:57  <phreeza> very interesting
2010-10-15T12:49:59  <McLeopold> odd/even?  just like rps, but you hold out 1 or 2 figures...
2010-10-15T12:50:20  <McLeopold> ...and someone calls odd or even at the beginning...
2010-10-15T12:50:33  <McLeopold> ...then you total the numbers and see if it is odd or even.

2010-10-15T12:59:58  <McLeopold> I do think I need to add a neutral to make it perfect...
2010-10-15T13:00:03  <McLeopold> in the center
2010-10-15T13:00:19  <McLeopold> but that means I have to tamper with the growth rates and starting ships...
2010-10-15T13:00:34  <jmcarthur> ah snap you're right. you can lose by taking your neutral and being attacked
2010-10-15T13:00:39  <McLeopold> :)
2010-10-15T13:01:00  <McLeopold> attack beats neutral, neutral beats hold, hold sucks...
2010-10-15T13:01:23  <McLeopold> That's why I need a neutral, so that holding can beat an attack.
2010-10-15T13:01:26  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3417), MariusCG(3391), deepblue(3328), Hazard(3304), EBraun(3289), felixcoto(3272), ruilov(3253), ofrias(3246), Manwe56(3243), savchenko(3228)
2010-10-15T13:01:30  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: so it looks like the best strategy for both players is to pick randomly between staying and attacking the other's home planet
2010-10-15T13:01:55  <McLeopold> Well, attacking guarantees a draw, but not a win.
2010-10-15T13:01:59  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: and i think all combinations of those result in a draw
2010-10-15T13:02:12  <jmcarthur> right. there is no win if both play optimally
2010-10-15T13:02:35  <McLeopold> If I can get hold to beat attack, I've got it.
2010-10-15T13:02:47  *** Migi32 <Migi32!~migi@d54C1252E.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-15T13:03:28  <jmcarthur> yeah, that would put the optimal strategy at picking randomly between holding, attacking, or taking neutral
2010-10-15T13:03:46  <jmcarthur> and the winner would be nondeterministic
2010-10-15T13:04:17  <McLeopold> Only on some maps.  If I can figure this out, I wonder if a map generator could always produce these types.
2010-10-15T13:04:42  <jmcarthur> it would be a draw 1 out of 3 times
2010-10-15T13:06:36  <jmcarthur> i don't see how you could make holding beat attacking
2010-10-15T13:07:35  *** hellman <hellman!~hellman@nat232-248-205-109.tvoe.tv> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-10-15T13:10:35  <jmcarthur> hmm... i guess with a neutral in the middle you could have a sniping strategy of some sort take over if your opponent attacks while you hold
2010-10-15T13:10:37  <McLeopold> holding leaves you with 5 free ships
2010-10-15T13:10:53  <jmcarthur> yes, but your opponent also gains 5
2010-10-15T13:11:09  <jmcarthur> so you're back at square one
2010-10-15T13:11:18  <McLeopold> but his won't be available until turn 5, yours are available now
2010-10-15T13:11:28  <jmcarthur> unless he's streaming
2010-10-15T13:12:09  <jmcarthur> which he should do if he sees you holding, i think
2010-10-15T13:12:22  <McLeopold> a neutral 4 would still go to the person that holds, it just messes up the other scenarios.
2010-10-15T13:12:49  <jmcarthur> at one point can the holder take a center neutral if the opponent is streaming?
2010-10-15T13:13:01  <jmcarthur> *at what point

2010-10-15T13:13:20  <McLeopold> maybe a 4 neutral for both sides, that's far away
2010-10-15T13:13:52  <jmcarthur> seems like taking that would become the dominant strategy then
2010-10-15T13:14:07  <McLeopold> no, it should still lose to an attack
2010-10-15T13:14:30  <McLeopold> sorry, 2 neutrals, 1 each side, behind the 7 neutral
2010-10-15T13:14:39  <jmcarthur> right
2010-10-15T13:14:48  <McLeopold> I think that would work!
2010-10-15T13:14:57  <jmcarthur> what growth and distance, and how many neutral ships?
2010-10-15T13:16:00  <McLeopold> no, it won't work
2010-10-15T13:16:10  <jmcarthur> also, i still don't see when you would get a chance to take that after holding
2010-10-15T13:16:15  <McLeopold> if you can hold against an attack and get a neutral, that is always best
2010-10-15T13:16:34  <McLeopold> it would have to be 1 in the center
2010-10-15T13:17:15  <jmcarthur> have to adjust all the distances for that now
2010-10-15T13:18:17  <jmcarthur> i think it might work though

2010-10-15T13:18:44  <jmcarthur> but the center neutral needs a big growth
2010-10-15T13:19:50  <jmcarthur> it works because it's *only* worth taking the center if you hold and your opponent either attacks or tries to take the center
2010-10-15T13:19:55  *** Bobng <Bobng!~T@84.13.164.95> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-10-15T13:20:05  <McLeopold> no, the center neutral would have to have less growth than the others
2010-10-15T13:20:05  <jmcarthur> otherwise you can just get stung

2010-10-15T13:20:25  <McLeopold> So, I need everything else to have more growth, then I can add the center neutral
2010-10-15T13:20:38  <jmcarthur> it would have to be enough to counter an attack though
2010-10-15T13:20:56  <McLeopold> ?

2010-10-15T13:21:28  <jmcarthur> enough to counter an attack at home
2010-10-15T13:21:46  <McLeopold> with a center neutral, there is a forth strategy, which I need to make sure has the same outcome as holding
2010-10-15T13:21:48  <jmcarthur> especially if your home or neutral have a larger growth
2010-10-15T13:22:42  <McLeopold> going for the center has to be less desireable than going for the back neutral, thus, the back neutral must have larger growth
2010-10-15T13:23:01  <jmcarthur> the center is fairly undesirable anyway due to sniping
2010-10-15T13:23:23  <jmcarthur> regardless of growth
2010-10-15T13:23:24  <McLeopold> right, but I need to make sure that neutral beats hold/center
2010-10-15T13:23:56  <jmcarthur> it doesn't take all your ships to take your near neutral, so you could still snipe an attempt to take the center
2010-10-15T13:24:16  <McLeopold> on turn 1?
2010-10-15T13:24:22  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.178.148> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2010-10-15T13:24:31  <McLeopold> sniping only works on turn 2
2010-10-15T13:24:46  <jmcarthur> if the center is two turns from each home then you can snipe on turn 2 after moving to take your near neutral on turn 1
2010-10-15T13:25:00  <jmcarthur> so there is still no motivation to take the center unless your opponent attacks
2010-10-15T13:25:04  <McLeopold> so, your left over ships if you take the back neutral must be less than a snipe attempt
2010-10-15T13:25:16  <jmcarthur> less?
2010-10-15T13:25:32  <jmcarthur> no i think the snipe is what makes the center neutral feasible for this
2010-10-15T13:25:51  <McLeopold> the center of this map would be 3 from each start
2010-10-15T13:25:54  <jmcarthur> since it makes the neutral only desireable after you hold and your opponent attacks
2010-10-15T13:26:21  <McLeopold> I think it might should be offset up or down enough to keep it out of the way
2010-10-15T13:28:42  <McLeopold> you have 2 left after taking neutral, if you opponent attacks, you are dead, no sniping
2010-10-15T13:28:59  <McLeopold> if your opponent doesn't attack, you can send 2 for a snipe
2010-10-15T13:29:22  <McLeopold> which would beat the opponent going straight for the center neutral
2010-10-15T13:29:25  <McLeopold> with 5
2010-10-15T13:29:44  <McLeopold> If he went with 6 or more? we need that to be a loss
2010-10-15T13:30:13  <McLeopold> so the neutral needs to be far enough away that taking the back neutral is faster
2010-10-15T13:30:44  <jmcarthur> i'm saying we can make center/hold be a loss, center/attack be a win, center/near be a loss, and center/center of course be a draw
2010-10-15T13:30:48  <McLeopold> but not so far that holding and taking it would hurt
2010-10-15T13:30:59  <jmcarthur> where win/loss/draw is for the first player in those combos
2010-10-15T13:31:58  <jmcarthur> and if it's that far, it needs a reasonably nice growth to be worth it i think
2010-10-15T13:32:27  <McLeopold> no, just 1 more than opponent so you have more ships
2010-10-15T13:33:09  <McLeopold> it needs to be not worth it at all, unless you opponent tries an all out attack
2010-10-15T13:33:09  <jmcarthur> your opponent would have both homes and access to both near neutrals if you can't counterattack after taking center

2010-10-15T14:18:11  <bhasker> or send too many ships on their way too early
2010-10-15T14:18:16  <bhasker> so most of my ships are in flight
2010-10-15T14:18:23  <bhasker> while he happily snipes my neutrals
2010-10-15T14:18:27  <bhasker> then it just goes downhill
2010-10-15T14:19:20  <bhasker> and my bot doesn't do too well on split maps where planets are really far apart
2010-10-15T14:19:29  <bhasker> it sends too many ships back and forth

2010-10-15T14:52:28  <Migi32> McLeopold, in that last game sending 100 to the small neutral with 3 ships wasn't the best opening move I think

2010-10-15T16:10:27  <rebelxt> phreeza_: true. first few turns decide games on "simple" maps where you don't have to split forces over 2-3 different regions

2010-10-15T16:14:33  <rebelxt> phreeza_: exactly in 99% cases it takes me 15 seconds to come up with opening much better than what my bot does... on virtually every map
2010-10-15T16:15:55  <phreeza_> once i have my tree search working, maybe i can build it using that, even if it doesn't work as a real bot due to time constraints

2010-10-15T16:17:47  <rebelxt> phreeza_: if you get tree search to work, it's going to be awesome

2010-10-15T16:25:47  <phreeza_> actually he says its A* but i'm not sure how that is supposed to work in the context of a tree search
2010-10-15T16:26:13  <rebelxt> i tried - it was too slow and too buggy. begging for another attempt
2010-10-15T16:26:45  <phreeza_> its fun to watch actually... very erratic in the openings but sometimes it actually works

2010-10-15T17:08:23  <bhasker__> yup
2010-10-15T17:08:59  <McLeopold> that map was a build fast map for sure.  I need to detect that.
2010-10-15T17:10:11  <bhasker__> hmm i don't do any such detection, i have to add some map intelligence into the bot
2010-10-15T17:10:18  <bhasker__> so that it alters strategy based on map
2010-10-15T17:10:59  <McLeopold> I think, if the middle sucks, build fast.  Otherwise, throw to the center.
2010-10-15T17:11:17  <Migi32> I have this rule: take what you can hold
2010-10-15T17:11:34  <Migi32> McLeopold, you seem to be sending your first 100 ships to 1 planet a lot, is that intentional?
2010-10-15T17:11:55  <McLeopold> Migi32: yes, because I want to react to the enemy and steal stuff.
2010-10-15T17:11:58  <bhasker__> migi it makes sense when you have a strong centre
2010-10-15T17:12:05  <bhasker__> and to protect your most valuable planet
2010-10-15T17:12:06  <JamesMG> it's pretty effective when the planet he throws to is cheap enough and central enough to snipe enemy expansion
2010-10-15T17:12:18  <bhasker__> my bot does that too
2010-10-15T17:12:30  <bhasker__> though not as aggresive as mcleopolds
2010-10-15T17:12:41  <JamesMG> mine had that at one point, but it misused it so I took it away

2010-10-15T17:12:57  <bhasker__> the basic idea is if X turns from now the planet is going to be long to you , you might as well send your ships there
2010-10-15T17:12:59  <bhasker__> in advance
2010-10-15T17:13:04  <bhasker__> rather than waiting for it to convert
2010-10-15T17:13:07  <bhasker__> and then sending
2010-10-15T17:13:21  <bhasker__> s/long/belong
2010-10-15T17:13:34  <JamesMG> plus, if most of your strength is in the center, the enemy can't expand there without being sniped
2010-10-15T17:13:46  <rebelxt> right, but only if that's one of the planets you are going to be funneling ships to
2010-10-15T17:14:19  <bhasker__> well the way i pick that planet is by an average of distance to enemy planets and mine
2010-10-15T17:14:29  <bhasker__> so its usually well located

2010-10-15T17:14:36  <bhasker__> sometimes it can get messed up
2010-10-15T17:14:41  <bhasker__> if i end up losing that planet and i stop sending ships there
2010-10-15T17:14:46  <bhasker__> and now i have a skewed setup
2010-10-15T17:15:10  <rebelxt> yeah you might want a more complex function. did you try center of mass calculation?
2010-10-15T17:15:19  <bhasker__> hmm should try that
2010-10-15T17:15:23  <bhasker__> good idea
2010-10-15T17:15:24  <bhasker__> thanks rebel
2010-10-15T17:15:31  <bhasker__> didn't think of center of mass
2010-10-15T17:15:40  <Migi32> rebelxt, center of mass is always the center of the map
2010-10-15T17:15:42  <bhasker__> i replaced some of the other average stuff with an exponential decay function
2010-10-15T17:15:52  <bhasker__> well center of mass of contrlled planets
2010-10-15T17:15:54  <bhasker__> which can change
2010-10-15T17:15:58  <McLeopold> the maps are symmetric, center of mass is always planet 0
2010-10-15T17:16:04  <bhasker__> not all planets
2010-10-15T17:16:19  <rebelxt> Migi32, no, center of mass is the point where enemy has the most forces
2010-10-15T17:16:29  <rebelxt> so it depends on how the ships are allocated
2010-10-15T17:16:30  <bhasker__> ah hmm
2010-10-15T17:16:36  <Migi32> ah, the enemy's center of mass
2010-10-15T17:16:41  <Migi32> mass being ships
2010-10-15T17:16:48  <rebelxt> yep
2010-10-15T17:17:00  <rebelxt> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass
2010-10-15T17:17:08  <McLeopold> like cultural influence in civ
2010-10-15T17:17:12  <Migi32> I think you can get skewed results when the enemy has two "groups" of planets
2010-10-15T17:17:31  <bhasker__> any statistic can get skewed
2010-10-15T17:17:39  <bhasker__> the questions is how resistant it is to skewing
2010-10-15T17:17:46  <bhasker__> average is very susceptible
2010-10-15T17:18:03  <rebelxt> Migi32, correct, but you can detect clusters of planets. it does not have to be a single center of masss
2010-10-15T17:18:39  <Migi32> rebelxt, I don't think cluster recognition is as easy as in Tron
2010-10-15T17:18:56  <McLeopold> it's not hard
2010-10-15T17:19:01  <bhasker__> should be easy to do
2010-10-15T17:19:06  <McLeopold> test on map5
2010-10-15T17:19:07  <bhasker__> just start from a planet
2010-10-15T17:19:08  <rebelxt> Migi32, it's doable
2010-10-15T17:19:09  <bhasker__> and grow it
2010-10-15T17:19:17  <bhasker__> tillthe next planet is > dist
2010-10-15T17:19:24  <bhasker__> then do the same from another random planet not in a cluster
2010-10-15T17:19:54  <Migi32> oh. like that.
2010-10-15T17:20:54  <bhasker__> my bot can't seem to break the 300 elo rating barrier:(
2010-10-15T17:20:56  <bhasker__> :((
2010-10-15T17:21:07  <bhasker__> keeps going upto 285 then back down to 270
2010-10-15T17:21:44  <Migi32> perhaps because your true ELO is only ~280? No offense, I don't really know your bot very well.
2010-10-15T17:22:11  <bhasker__> it probably is 280 :)
2010-10-15T17:22:17  <bhasker__> though i was hoping it would do better:(
2010-10-15T17:22:29  <bhasker__> will have to analyze more games and fix bugs^
2010-10-15T17:22:37  <a1k0n> the trick is to be good against all players, not just the ones ranked on top :)

2010-10-15T17:44:34  <boegel> hmm, code im jar file says differently
2010-10-15T17:44:37  <boegel> wtf
2010-10-15T17:49:09  <boegel> heh, weird bug
2010-10-15T17:49:54  <boegel> if my last planet (growth 5), has 95 ships, and in the next turn an enemy fleet of 100 ships hits, what should happen?
2010-10-15T17:50:10  <McLeopold> boegel: 0, you own
2010-10-15T17:50:25  <boegel> McLeopold: yeah, I figured as much
2010-10-15T17:50:39  <boegel> McLeopold: doesn't matter if it's my last planet, right?
2010-10-15T17:50:43  <McLeopold> no
2010-10-15T17:50:52  <boegel> k, thx
2010-10-15T17:51:09  <boegel> so, that's a bug somewhere in this game engine, beuh
2010-10-15T17:51:26  <McLeopold> unless you sent an invalid order?
2010-10-15T17:51:41  <bhasker__> if it was your last planet i would look for a divide by zero
2010-10-15T17:52:06  <bhasker__> usually when my bot crashes at last turn its usually because i was dividing by something without checking
2010-10-15T17:52:41  <McLeopold> Yeah, I was plagued with divide by zero errors for awhile.
2010-10-15T17:53:03  <boegel> hmm, right
2010-10-15T17:53:24  <boegel> I should check and make sure
2010-10-15T17:53:27  <boegel> thx
2010-10-15T17:53:37  <rebelxt> dmj111, tnx. i had to shut mine down - laptop battery ran out. we got one game though

2010-10-15T18:17:31  <boegel> hmm
2010-10-15T18:17:43  <boegel> when is a game *lost*
2010-10-15T18:17:51  <boegel> if you have zero ships at sone point?
2010-10-15T18:18:14  <boegel> or if you have no more planets left (or the max turn count is reached, of course)?
2010-10-15T18:18:24  <boegel> what if I have one (empty) planet
2010-10-15T18:18:32  <boegel> at some turn
2010-10-15T18:18:36  <boegel> do I lose instantly?
2010-10-15T18:19:56  <Migi32> "Provided that neither player performs an invalid action, the player with the most ships at the end of the game wins. The game may also end earlier if one of the players loses all his ships, in which case the player that has ships remaining wins instantly."
2010-10-15T18:20:28  <boegel> ah
2010-10-15T18:20:34  <Migi32> so yes, only empty planets = lost
2010-10-15T18:20:35  <boegel> so losing all ships is enough to lose
2010-10-15T18:20:58  <boegel> Migi32: which is kind of sad, because your planets will regain ships in the next turn...
2010-10-15T18:21:16  <boegel> anyway, glad that's cleared out
2010-10-15T18:21:22  <Migi32> boegel, if you'd win after that it'd be the most insane comeback ever
2010-10-15T18:21:22  <boegel> Migi32: how's your bot doing?
2010-10-15T18:21:33  <boegel> Migi32: it would be cool though
2010-10-15T18:21:45  <boegel> Migi32: also, it depends on the game state I guess
2010-10-15T18:22:15  <Migi32> boegel, turns out the kind of things I wanted to use for my bot are far too cpu-expensive
2010-10-15T18:22:37  <Migi32> 1 second is not much

2010-10-15T18:23:18  <mager> my AI crashes everytime :/
2010-10-15T18:23:21  <boegel> hey, my bot runs in like 100ms each turn now :)
2010-10-15T18:25:31  <mager> i think the AI's should run until the battles are over instead of stopping at 200 turns :P
2010-10-15T18:26:04  <JamesMG> would be forever in some cases
2010-10-15T18:26:35  <jmcarthur> Migi32, boegel: actually, the spec as i wrote it is wrong on that point
2010-10-15T18:26:56  <jmcarthur> the game isn't necessarily over just because you have no ships left. possession of a planet keeps the game going
2010-10-15T18:27:17  <mager> YAY!! my AI beat the prospector! :P
2010-10-15T18:27:30  <Migi32> congraturlations mager! :D
2010-10-15T18:27:31  <mager> now if only it would quit crashing against everything else....
2010-10-15T18:27:42  <mager> thanks Migi :)
2010-10-15T18:27:54  <mager> but it won after 642 turns :/
2010-10-15T18:28:06  <Migi32> mager, some games would never end
2010-10-15T18:28:35  <Migi32> and we only have 1 server that can do about 1000 turns per minute
2010-10-15T18:28:36  <mager> yeah, but 200 turns isn't long enough for the tables to turn :P

2010-10-15T18:33:18  <bhasker__> my bot on the official server is at rank 100 odd
2010-10-15T18:33:19  <bhasker__> stuck there
2010-10-15T18:34:43  <mager> Zannick - Most colleges have moved into Java programming and in the field I intend to head into, i don't really care for it :/ I'm having a lot of trouble finding a school that still teaches C++
2010-10-15T18:35:01  <Zannick> many don't
2010-10-15T18:35:22  <Zannick> i went to cmu, they did java, c, and sml while i was there
2010-10-15T18:35:31  <mager> i dont see why...they stopped teaching C++ to make it easier, but computer science is supposed to be a challenge :/
2010-10-15T18:35:35  <Zannick> they have added python to the intro courses
2010-10-15T18:35:59  <Zannick> but there are classes that use c++, like the graphics course
2010-10-15T18:36:02  <mager> I think we need to start a movement to go back to C++! :)
2010-10-15T18:36:07  <Zannick> plus you can always teach yourself
2010-10-15T18:36:12  <bhasker__> k i think i should treat myself to coffee
2010-10-15T18:36:14  <bhasker__> rank 5 now
2010-10-15T18:36:15  <bhasker__> !!
2010-10-15T18:36:15  <contestbot> bhasker__: No!
2010-10-15T18:37:08  <mager> but i'd rather have someone help me.  Im 16 and live in the most rural area possible, i practically run my schools technology district.  I've taught myself a lot - but somethings you just need someone with experience, you know?
2010-10-15T18:37:49  <Zannick> i still recommend CMU, even if you only want C++
2010-10-15T18:38:15  <mager> whats CMU?
2010-10-15T18:38:26  <Zannick> Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh
2010-10-15T18:39:07  <Zannick> you'll see it pop up if you go looking for good cs schools
2010-10-15T18:39:35  <mager> i'll check them out - i kinda like full sail university, anyone know anything about them?
2010-10-15T18:39:56  <mager> btw - 688 turns takes forever to load the viewr :/

2010-10-15T18:41:01  <Zannick> it really depends on what you want, cs at cmu is not a lot of game programming but it's very good for programming in general and there's even a club dedicated to making computer games in your free time
2010-10-15T18:41:38  <Zannick> i don't know anything about full sail but i think they're a little more specific in studies
2010-10-15T18:42:27  <mager> i'd like to get a game programming degree specifically - thats generally focused directly on C++ unless its called Web game programming.

2010-10-15T19:34:34  <bhasker__> hmm
2010-10-15T19:34:39  <bhasker__> oh well time will tell :)
2010-10-15T19:34:59  <bhasker__> a couple more hours of running and i should know where it will settle down

2010-10-15T19:37:07  <Migi32> that's the problem with ELO, it never really settles down...
2010-10-15T19:37:11  <rebelxt> ELO does not mean much though - it really depends on who and how many people are running their bots at the moment, so only relate ELO matter
2010-10-15T19:37:31  <Migi32> bhasker__, what's your bot's name on TCP?
2010-10-15T19:37:39  <bhasker__> malazan
2010-10-15T19:37:44  <bhasker__> malazan-0.2 is the new one
2010-10-15T19:37:49  <rebelxt> i.e. once it settles in a couple of hours, how does its ELO compare to other usual suspects you compare ELO rating with
2010-10-15T19:37:58  <Migi32> ah yes nice ELO indeed :P
2010-10-15T19:38:04  <a1k0n> haha http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=506942

2010-10-15T19:51:30  <bhasker__> yup
2010-10-15T19:53:12  <phreeza> does the tcp server do any kind of swiss tournament or just first come first served matching?
2010-10-15T19:53:52  <McLeopold> first come, first server... but there are often more than 2 people trying to connect at the same time, so it does match by elo
2010-10-15T19:54:11  <McLeopold> but the choice is usually very limited
2010-10-15T19:56:09  <phreeza> ok
2010-10-15T19:56:52  <McLeopold> right now, if I connect, it says 33 con, 16 games
2010-10-15T19:57:03  <McLeopold> 16*2 is 32 connection in games, only me left
2010-10-15T19:57:12  <phreeza> yea so just one choice probably
2010-10-15T19:57:13  <McLeopold> So, I probably get matched with the next person
2010-10-15T19:57:40  <McLeopold> I've looked at the code, and it does elo matching, but I don't think it waits for more than one choice
2010-10-15T19:57:42  <phreeza> but it does seem to have some kind of mechanism to stop you from just being matched up with the same person forever?
2010-10-15T19:57:48  <McLeopold> nope
2010-10-15T19:57:52  <bhasker__> just random draw
2010-10-15T19:58:02  <phreeza> ah
2010-10-15T19:58:05  <bhasker__> my bot went up against the same guy almost 9 in a row
2010-10-15T19:58:07  <McLeopold> best bet is to run a loop and randomize your wait timer
2010-10-15T19:58:25  <McLeopold> that's because you both finished, the both get in the queue right away
2010-10-15T19:58:30  <a1k0n> it does actually try to match you up with someon enear you in ELO
2010-10-15T19:58:30  <rebelxt> looking at tcp server source, it just picks first user from the FIFO queue, then finds another user in the queue that has the closest ELO, then starts the game
2010-10-15T19:58:39  <a1k0n> but it doesn't wait in the "lobby" long enough for such a match to usually occur
2010-10-15T19:59:00  <McLeopold> yeah, i wish it would wait 60 seconds or so
2010-10-15T19:59:20  <McLeopold> If dmj111 and I ever get a python server going, we'll add that.
2010-10-15T19:59:52  <McLeopold> CrowBot's back up.
2010-10-15T20:00:04  <McLeopold> I'm fixing bugs in AntBot
2010-10-15T20:00:14  <bhasker__> lets see how my bot does against crowbot
2010-10-15T20:00:35  <McLeopold> It should win.  Unless you're weak on close starts.
2010-10-15T20:00:41  <McLeopold> Or unless we draw map1

2010-10-15T20:01:55  <bhasker__> yea i do that
2010-10-15T20:02:04  <McLeopold> do you do it on turn 2?
2010-10-15T20:02:09  <bhasker__> need to do that
2010-10-15T20:02:16  <McLeopold> :)
2010-10-15T20:02:28  <bhasker__> actually i added it at turn 2
2010-10-15T20:02:29  <McLeopold> It's fun to watch dhartmei's bot break down on turn 10.
2010-10-15T20:02:32  <bhasker__> then removed it don't remember
2010-10-15T20:02:37  <bhasker__> why i did that 6
2010-10-15T20:03:53  <bhasker__> actually my bot will break down in certain close situations i think i am going to change it so that it keeps doing that till both of us have a couple of planets
2010-10-15T20:03:59  <bhasker__> then switch to a different heuristic
2010-10-15T20:04:00  <bhasker__> or something
2010-10-15T20:04:16  <bhasker__> rather than do it based on turn numbers
2010-10-15T20:04:31  <McLeopold> yeah, any code based on turn number is bad
2010-10-15T20:04:46  <McLeopold> any magic number is bad too
