2011-08-10T18:06:45  <JamesMG> hey, at least we know it won't cause issues like the contest servers last year did
2011-08-10T18:08:41  <mleise> Let's talk about compilers that interpret the code they compile to generate more code to compile. I like that topic.
2011-08-10T18:10:17  <mleise> Can any compiler to date compile regular expressions to machine code?
2011-08-10T18:12:17  <JamesMG> it seems interpreters using something vaguely similar to the bitap algorithm can get close to that
2011-08-10T18:12:59  <mleise> JamesMG: I just googled this line up from Wikipedia: "In 1968, Thompson presented a method to automatically compile regular expressions to machine code, which is then executed in order to perform the matching on an input text."
2011-08-10T18:13:11  <mleise> Now THAT has come a long way
2011-08-10T18:14:02  <JamesMG> yeah I was just reading that
2011-08-10T18:18:12  <mleise> JamesMG: A guy named Dmitry Olshansky is working on a Google Summer Of Code project to create a new regex module for D. It looks like he was able to let the compiler translate the regex into D code and compile that.
2011-08-10T18:19:48  <mleise> It's pretty awesome if you think of the applications. Pretty much every domain specific language could be translated into the languages own syntax and compiled in one go, just using the language's syntax and compile time string manipulation capabilities.
2011-08-10T18:20:42  <mleise> Well, at least the simple ones you tend to write some times for your projects :p
2011-08-10T18:25:14  <mleise> And since you can also import external files I guess there is nothing stopping me from loading the visualizer JavaScript source code and write some compile-time function that turns it into D code to be compiled. Except for lack of understanding of both languages and real life.
2011-08-10T18:29:06  <JamesMG> It would've been extremely useful to me a year ago

2011-08-10T19:53:54  <bhasker> unity is interesting but i am having a hard time dealing with the scenebased approach to game dev
2011-08-10T19:54:58  <bhasker> except the free version is quite limited and its license is quite expensive
2011-08-10T19:55:10  <bhasker> jmonkey otoh is not as polished but is free
2011-08-10T19:56:27  <JamesMG> I ended up doing an iOS project in Unity, the scene thing is strange
2011-08-10T19:56:46  <JamesMG> luckily it being relatively simple and actually mostly 2d I do most things through code instead anyways
2011-08-10T19:56:58  <bhasker> yea
2011-08-10T19:57:14  <bhasker> i saw some tutorials and i get the basic idea
2011-08-10T19:57:21  <bhasker> the interesting thing about unity is the asset store
2011-08-10T19:57:27  <mleise> I saw a guy talk about engines today and he said noone today writes an engine from sratch. That would take several years to do! Well, among the 20 people working on and off on Gothic III there were some coders and among the coders were some working on their own engine. So I guess it is still the case even for small teams to write their own engines when the standard packages just don't work.
2011-08-10T19:57:29  <bhasker> pretty awesome stuff available for free and off the bat
2011-08-10T19:57:48  <bhasker> mostly engines are too extensive
2011-08-10T19:57:56  <bhasker> most people don't need to write their own rendering engines though
2011-08-10T19:58:00  <bhasker> game engine is different
2011-08-10T19:58:11  <bhasker> like a lot of folks pick up ogre3d as the rendering
2011-08-10T19:58:22  <bhasker> jmonkey is a game engine though
2011-08-10T19:58:47  <JamesMG> really the only Unity functionality I am using is asset management and its rendering pipeline
2011-08-10T19:58:56  <mleise> Well you can collect stuff like path finding algorithms, physics engines, audio libs, model loaders and still call the final product your own engine
2011-08-10T19:59:05  <bhasker> yes that is what a lot of people do
2011-08-10T19:59:13  <bhasker> i would rather not go down that route, though very interesting
2011-08-10T19:59:18  <bhasker> i would rather get the game done
2011-08-10T19:59:36  <bhasker> once you down the route of writing everything from scratch
2011-08-10T19:59:44  <bhasker> its a never ending project
2011-08-10T19:59:54  <mleise> oh SpeedTree is of course the one library that made all games look the same at one point :p
2011-08-10T20:00:05  <bhasker> heh
2011-08-10T20:00:17  <bhasker> did you know that avatar trees were generated using speedtree?
2011-08-10T20:00:30  <mleise> no, really? that's awesome
2011-08-10T20:00:34  <bhasker> all the vegetation in Avatar was generated using speedtree
2011-08-10T20:00:39  <bhasker> check out their website
2011-08-10T20:00:58  <bhasker> they ahve an article on how ILM studios used Speedtree
2011-08-10T20:01:05  <mleise> I believe you, but what was used in real-time games did not quite match that
2011-08-10T20:01:40  <bhasker> http://www.speedtree.com/downloads/Avatar_User_Profile.pdf
2011-08-10T20:02:03  <mleise> you always had trees made of usually one sprite turning towars the viewer and waving in the wind a bit. The color had a gradient and was darker in the center of the tree.
2011-08-10T20:02:23  <bhasker> most tree support was /is still using billboards?
2011-08-10T20:03:23  <mleise> I haven't played recent titles, but what I knew from Gothic III or Elder Scrolls looked pretty much the same for a lot of people. You could just see that a game used SpeedTree
2011-08-10T20:03:30  <bhasker> heh
2011-08-10T20:03:50  <bhasker> you should check out allods online free-to-play mmo the game has pretty awesome art
2011-08-10T20:03:52  <mleise> That was bad for RPGs that are supposed to look otherworldly
2011-08-10T20:03:54  <bhasker> similar to wow in playstyle
2011-08-10T20:04:02  <bhasker> but pretty neat artwork
2011-08-10T20:04:04  <JamesMG> I didn't realize it was all actually the same, interesting
2011-08-10T20:06:27  <bhasker> btw james have you looked at recast and detour?
2011-08-10T20:06:38  <bhasker> pretty awesome pathfinding libraries
2011-08-10T20:07:08  <JamesMG> nope, I was going to go with a really simple a* implementation for this project
2011-08-10T20:07:47  <JamesMG> all I actually need is for sim city style people to not walk through buildings
2011-08-10T20:07:47  <bhasker> ah k
2011-08-10T20:07:57  <bhasker> you should check out recast/detour
2011-08-10T20:08:33  <bhasker> the authors blog http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/
2011-08-10T20:08:42  <JamesMG> awesome, will have to read up on that
2011-08-10T20:13:49  <JamesMG> I like that blog, fun read
2011-08-10T20:15:31  <bhasker> yea its pretty amazing read
2011-08-10T20:15:39  <bhasker> this library is being used in quite a few games now
2011-08-10T20:15:40  <bhasker> killzone3
2011-08-10T20:15:43  <bhasker> resistance 3
2011-08-10T20:15:44  <bhasker> etc
2011-08-10T20:16:00  <bhasker> pretty much the best pathfinding open source library you can find right now
