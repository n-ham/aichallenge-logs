2012-02-04T11:40:10  <ic4rus> Hi
2012-02-04T11:40:30  <ic4rus> is there anything already known about the next AI challange?
2012-02-04T11:43:20  <UncleVasya> I've heard admins want to do a major framework rewritment before they will do something specific for the next challenge.
2012-02-04T11:43:48  <ic4rus> hmmm
2012-02-04T11:45:17  <ic4rus> so it will be a while?
2012-02-04T11:45:49  <ic4rus> more like a "once a year" thing?
2012-02-04T11:46:17  <UncleVasya> I think they will not start any work until April because usually several months after finals is a Dead Time for contest development.

2012-02-04T11:48:56  <UncleVasya> And if I'm right, nobody knows yet.
2012-02-04T11:50:02  <UncleVasya> There was activity in preparing Asteroids game but not much.

2012-02-04T11:51:55  <UncleVasya> Also I've heard once that admins wanna make website with Joomla instead of current php one.php
2012-02-04T11:59:15  <pairofdice> Joomla? I thought it was  Django
2012-02-04T12:04:06  <mcstar> they mentioned django i remember
