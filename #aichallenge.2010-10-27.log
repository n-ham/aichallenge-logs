2010-10-27T00:00:03  <antimatroid1> it seemed to do more harm than good
2010-10-27T00:00:17  <McLeopold> When you find the magic formula, it will do a lot of good.
2010-10-27T00:00:41  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@112.135.81.44> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-27T00:01:49  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-10-27T00:01:59  <antimatroid1> i want to get a good bot before i start trying to train parameters
2010-10-27T00:02:09  <McLeopold> so, I decided to run my official version (#5) on tcp again with a couple of tweaks
2010-10-27T00:02:12  <antimatroid1> i still have a lot of things to iron out before i can add moves back in from the other player
2010-10-27T00:02:16  <bhasker> mcleopold
2010-10-27T00:02:23  <bhasker> which bot are you running
2010-10-27T00:02:27  <antimatroid1> my bot currently crashes on the main site, i need to address that too
2010-10-27T00:02:30  <McLeopold> I think I lost 50 before I realized I had special code to make it lose.
2010-10-27T00:03:07  <McLeopold> bhasker: closer to official than anything
2010-10-27T00:03:20  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-10-27T00:03:39  <bhasker> scotbot5?
2010-10-27T00:03:42  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-10-27T00:03:51  <McLeopold> did you see that epic win early in the day
2010-10-27T00:03:55  <bhasker> which one?
2010-10-27T00:04:01  <McLeopold> the first one
2010-10-27T00:04:09  <McLeopold> when you played my handicapped version
2010-10-27T00:04:25  <bhasker> ah
2010-10-27T00:04:30  <bhasker> i think i did
2010-10-27T00:04:30  <McLeopold> and my bot looked like a sprinkler watering the lawn
2010-10-27T00:04:38  <bhasker> though http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=723418 :)
2010-10-27T00:04:44  <McLeopold> I really hate that map
2010-10-27T00:05:10  <McLeopold> no, it was the map with 2 giant globs of planets separated by space
2010-10-27T00:05:11  <Frontier> I can't tell one map from another.
2010-10-27T00:05:41  <bhasker> i think i pasted that in irc chat today
2010-10-27T00:05:45  <bhasker> earler in the tday
2010-10-27T00:05:51  <McLeopold> hmm
2010-10-27T00:06:04  <bhasker> right now my bot's are busy playing each other
2010-10-27T00:06:07  <bhasker> 0.11 vs 0.12
2010-10-27T00:06:15  <bhasker> 0.12 is a bit more aggresive
2010-10-27T00:06:25  <bhasker> 0.11 seems to be doing better overall though
2010-10-27T00:06:39  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=715285
2010-10-27T00:06:58  <bhasker> ah yea saw that one
2010-10-27T00:07:03  <bhasker> it kept oscillating
2010-10-27T00:07:06  <bhasker> between two planets
2010-10-27T00:07:17  <bhasker> i think its an effect of my bots behaviour
2010-10-27T00:07:23  <McLeopold> I though it was funny
2010-10-27T00:07:26  <bhasker> my bot tends to shuttle
2010-10-27T00:07:28  <bhasker> ships
2010-10-27T00:07:31  <bhasker> its actually a bug
2010-10-27T00:07:37  <bhasker> i tend to overestimate ships needed
2010-10-27T00:07:44  <bhasker> so i keep shuttling them back and forth
2010-10-27T00:07:53  <bhasker> thats what is probably causing your bot to behave like that
2010-10-27T00:08:07  <bhasker> if you see closely you will see ship counts keep going up and down between the two planets
2010-10-27T00:08:18  <McLeopold> actually, I think yours was reacting to mine
2010-10-27T00:08:23  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-27T00:08:29  <bhasker> i do know my bot over sends ships
2010-10-27T00:08:37  <bhasker> i basically try to account for rate of flow of ships
2010-10-27T00:08:42  <bhasker> but when there are spikes
2010-10-27T00:08:48  <bhasker> that calculation is way offo
2010-10-27T00:08:49  <bhasker> off*
2010-10-27T00:08:55  <bhasker> so i tend to send more than required
2010-10-27T00:08:58  <bhasker> has costed me games
2010-10-27T00:09:15  <bhasker> but i sadly haven't been able to come up with a good way to estimate that
2010-10-27T00:10:13  <bhasker> if i try to be exact i lose planets when enemy is closer than my main support planet
2010-10-27T00:10:35  <bhasker> if i overestimate i tend to sometimes keep shuttling ships back and forth and lose
2010-10-27T00:10:35  <McLeopold> I'm usually the other way, not sending enough
2010-10-27T00:10:52  <bhasker> basically i am thinking maybe i will send 2x the ships
2010-10-27T00:12:04  <contestbot> Top 10 players: rsergio(3814), protocolocon(3762), dmj111(3759), Slin-.-(3685), felixcoto(3665), jambachili(3662), Hazard(3643), george(3603), sin_sun(3590), Simplex(3589)
2010-10-27T00:13:22  <bhasker> i have the attack part mostly figured out
2010-10-27T00:13:29  <bhasker> defense is where i am still having trouble
2010-10-27T00:13:31  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-27T00:14:33  <TheMacca> 17 wins in a row.
2010-10-27T00:14:39  <bhasker> nice
2010-10-27T00:15:02  <TheMacca> It is nice to watch his bot in action :)
2010-10-27T00:15:13  <bhasker> whose bot?
2010-10-27T00:15:30  <TheMacca> bocsimacko's
2010-10-27T00:15:40  <bhasker> ah
2010-10-27T00:15:41  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-27T00:15:42  <TheMacca> his latest on he official is 17/17
2010-10-27T00:16:01  <bhasker> his bot is like a time travelling bot
2010-10-27T00:16:48  <TheMacca> Yeah, there's some pretty impressive forecasting going on there.
2010-10-27T00:17:32  <TheMacca> I like the cases where he uses planets that he doesn't own yet in his fleet calcs
2010-10-27T00:21:00  <McLeopold> TheMacca: can you give an example?
2010-10-27T00:21:35  <TheMacca> McLeopold: I'd have to go looking, it was on the TCP server, but basically
2010-10-27T00:21:42  <TheMacca> there was a cluster of three planets
2010-10-27T00:21:45  <TheMacca> far to one side
2010-10-27T00:21:52  <TheMacca> he sent three fleets
2010-10-27T00:22:04  <TheMacca> the largest fleet wasn't big enough to take the largest planet
2010-10-27T00:22:12  <TheMacca> they all arrived roughly same time (ish)
2010-10-27T00:22:24  <TheMacca> and he used the smaller two to augment the larger fleet
2010-10-27T00:22:28  <TheMacca> and rolled over the cluster like a wave
2010-10-27T00:22:29  <TheMacca> was cool
2010-10-27T00:22:34  <TheMacca> will see if I can find, if you like
2010-10-27T00:22:42  <McLeopold> I think accoun does that too.
2010-10-27T00:22:47  <TheMacca> but it might have rolled off the list by now
2010-10-27T00:22:57  <TheMacca> it was at that exact moment I knew I might be out of my depth :)
2010-10-27T00:23:05  <McLeopold> Actually, AntBot does as well.
2010-10-27T00:23:41  <TheMacca> I haven't seen Accoun do it
2010-10-27T00:23:42  <bhasker> i need to factor that in somehow
2010-10-27T00:23:46  <bhasker> accoun doesn't do it
2010-10-27T00:23:49  <TheMacca> but haven't watched as many of his
2010-10-27T00:23:58  <bhasker> my bot has gone up a lot against accoun
2010-10-27T00:24:05  <bhasker> and his doesn't do that for sure
2010-10-27T00:24:44  <McLeopold> bhasker: he absolutely does it for sure, I watched tonight.
2010-10-27T00:24:52  <bhasker> hmm let me watch
2010-10-27T00:24:56  <McLeopold> if we are talking about the same thing...
2010-10-27T00:25:11  <TheMacca> Hey Mc, http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=705835
2010-10-27T00:25:22  <TheMacca> there's an example in here, it's not quite as clean
2010-10-27T00:25:41  <McLeopold> nw or se?
2010-10-27T00:25:53  <bhasker> i think nw
2010-10-27T00:25:56  <bhasker> he launches 15
2010-10-27T00:26:02  <TheMacca> E edge
2010-10-27T00:26:03  <bhasker> adds 1 from the neutral he cpatures 2-3 turns later
2010-10-27T00:26:05  <TheMacca> south ish
2010-10-27T00:26:11  <McLeopold> yeah, account does that too.
2010-10-27T00:26:15  <TheMacca> he sends a fleet of 7 to attack a 15
2010-10-27T00:26:20  <McLeopold> My ant bot does as well.
2010-10-27T00:26:30  <TheMacca> and picks up more from planets he doesn't own yet (at the time he sends the 7)
2010-10-27T00:26:50  <TheMacca> McLeopold: do you have an example in one of your games?
2010-10-27T00:26:52  <bhasker> ah you are right mc
2010-10-27T00:26:54  <bhasker> he does it
2010-10-27T00:26:56  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=723450
2010-10-27T00:27:01  <bhasker> watch the top planet with 41 ships
2010-10-27T00:27:27  <TheMacca> nice
2010-10-27T00:27:54  <bhasker> i shouldn't have lost that game though
2010-10-27T00:27:54  <bhasker> this version is aggresive
2010-10-27T00:28:00  <McLeopold> ouch, and he left himself open
2010-10-27T00:28:16  <McLeopold> bhasker: why didn't you take the center from him?
2010-10-27T00:28:29  <bhasker> not sure lol
2010-10-27T00:28:33  <bhasker> will have to look at the logs
2010-10-27T00:28:44  <bhasker> why my bot didnt attack is weird
2010-10-27T00:28:48  <McLeopold> that was some prime cherry picking you missed
2010-10-27T00:29:11  <bhasker> actually let me run it with logging enabled
2010-10-27T00:29:11  <bhasker> and see
2010-10-27T00:29:38  <bhasker> oh i think i know why
2010-10-27T00:29:43  <bhasker> my bot is too conservative
2010-10-27T00:29:44  <McLeopold> TheMacca, I'm looking for an example of AntBot doing it
2010-10-27T00:30:03  <bhasker> it calculates at start of turn how many ships it can spare without losing planet
2010-10-27T00:30:20  <bhasker> and as a result with 48 ships near it, it probably calculated it could only spare X ships
2010-10-27T00:30:28  <bhasker> where X<48+growth
2010-10-27T00:30:37  <bhasker> this is a bug i need to fix
2010-10-27T00:31:04  <d3c1ph3r> I'm doing an Human computer interface class and were redesigning youtube, if anybody can comment on my youtube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hWPTGEaZcE saying what they like or dont like about youtube interface and if their is anything to add or take away from it.!! thanks guys
2010-10-27T00:31:09  <bhasker> i never revisit or adjust my queue of available ships if the planet i am attacking could be affect my availability
2010-10-27T00:31:26  <bhasker> that is the reason i never attacked it
2010-10-27T00:31:34  <bhasker> if the balance of ships had been different i would have taken it
2010-10-27T00:31:40  <McLeopold> :D http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=715238
2010-10-27T00:32:00  <McLeopold> oh wait, no, that didn't count
2010-10-27T00:32:40  <bhasker> interesting you are doing it too
2010-10-27T00:32:53  <McLeopold> no, that 1 was extra at the beginning.
2010-10-27T00:33:11  <bhasker> no but you did launch 34 ships
2010-10-27T00:33:19  <bhasker> which got supplanted from your planet 3 turns later
2010-10-27T00:33:27  <bhasker> oh wait
2010-10-27T00:33:30  <bhasker> you launched it later
2010-10-27T00:33:44  <bhasker> hmm actually i should maybe try it out
2010-10-27T00:33:46  <TheMacca> the sw corner
2010-10-27T00:33:50  <bhasker> time to tinker with my code
2010-10-27T00:34:06  <TheMacca> you use it to attack the 60 in the center
2010-10-27T00:34:12  <TheMacca> before you own the sw corner
2010-10-27T00:34:30  <Frontier> d3c1ph3r: Only one thing - on the side bar I wish they would give a hint on wether a video is enabled for my country or not. I hate to click through 10 music videos and every one turns out to be locked by BMG or Sony.
2010-10-27T00:34:47  <bhasker> interesting i wonder how i can rework my code to do that
2010-10-27T00:35:34  <d3c1ph3r> please post your comments on the youtube page so my professor can see it
2010-10-27T00:35:41  <d3c1ph3r> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hWPTGEaZcE

2010-10-27T00:36:30  <bhasker> ouch
2010-10-27T00:36:46  <bhasker> running two bots is a bad idea
2010-10-27T00:36:52  <bhasker> my laptop gets too busy
2010-10-27T00:36:56  <bhasker> just lost a bunch of games to timeouts
2010-10-27T00:37:03  <McLeopold> d3c1ph3r: how is this related to PlanetWars?
2010-10-27T00:37:05  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=malazanbot0.12
2010-10-27T00:37:06  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-27T00:39:09  <McLeopold> I'd fire up AntBot so you could see the technique, but it's broken right now. :(
2010-10-27T00:40:23  <bhasker> i think i understand how to do it
2010-10-27T00:40:30  <bhasker> its just hard to work it into the way my code is written
2010-10-27T00:40:59  <McLeopold> it's worth the effort
2010-10-27T00:41:05  <bhasker> yea i can see that
2010-10-27T00:41:48  <bhasker> its probably easier for me to work it into the setup for planets already under my control
2010-10-27T00:42:42  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2010-10-27T00:42:43  <Frontier> bhasker: I've seen people send flleets sufficient for one neutral + another that has incoming enemy ships to the former. Then they launch ships from there to capture the second neutral which is then too close for the enemy to even react.
2010-10-27T00:43:26  <McLeopold> that's fun too
2010-10-27T00:43:32  <bhasker> that is not hard to do, just need to see how many ships you need to capture bot planets
2010-10-27T00:43:35  <bhasker> basically
2010-10-27T00:43:37  <Frontier> It works as long as your opponent does only see incoming fleets and can't estimate what the enemy is about to do.
2010-10-27T00:43:39  <bhasker> ships to capture neutral A
2010-10-27T00:43:45  <bhasker> + ships to capture neutral B from A
2010-10-27T00:43:49  <bhasker> and send that many to A
2010-10-27T00:44:08  <McLeopold> what's tricky is choosing the targets
2010-10-27T00:44:14  <Frontier> bhasker: but it takes a lot of record keeping.
2010-10-27T00:44:21  <bhasker> not it doesn't
2010-10-27T00:44:34  <bhasker> once enemy has launched his ships at that neutral
2010-10-27T00:44:39  <bhasker> you have perfect information
2010-10-27T00:44:45  <bhasker> to know how many to launch at A
2010-10-27T00:44:54  <bhasker> to capture A&B
2010-10-27T00:45:07  <McLeopold> prediction is different from record keeping
2010-10-27T00:45:22  <McLeopold> if you can program array, you can keep records
2010-10-27T00:45:28  <Frontier> ok, so I would write on special code path just for "snipe neutral from secondary planet after enemy has launched an attack". I dont like the idea ^^
2010-10-27T00:45:35  <bhasker> no frontier
2010-10-27T00:45:45  <bhasker> what i do is
2010-10-27T00:45:53  <bhasker> i calculate how many ships i need to take the neutral
2010-10-27T00:46:08  <bhasker> as neutral  + nearbyPlanets that are owned by enemy or will be in future
2010-10-27T00:46:10  <bhasker> and ships on them
2010-10-27T00:46:14  <McLeopold> Frontier: how about this.  You see 2 neutrals you would like to take,  They are near each other.  So send the amount needed to 1 planet only.
2010-10-27T00:46:43  <McLeopold> You lose a bit of time, but if the worst happens, you'll be okay.
2010-10-27T00:47:46  <Frontier> McLeopold: I would still need to keep record of the fact that planet 2 doesn't need ships in the next turns as long as the ships to planet 1 are commited to it somehow. so the fleets would be split up somehow.
2010-10-27T00:47:51  <McLeopold> Oh, wait, I think in your original description you should have said "later".

2010-10-27T00:48:13  <McLeopold> Frontier: yep.  you need that.
2010-10-27T00:48:32  <McLeopold> You can do it!
2010-10-27T00:48:44  <bhasker> frontier in most cases you would not have enough ships on the next turn
2010-10-27T00:48:47  <bhasker> to double launch
2010-10-27T00:49:06  <Frontier> That puts me on the safe side I guess, haha
2010-10-27T00:49:06  <bhasker> or next few turns
2010-10-27T00:49:22  <bhasker> so i wouldn't worry too much about double launches
2010-10-27T00:49:37  <bhasker> at least early game it won't be an issue
2010-10-27T00:49:43  <bhasker> late game you can probably disable it
2010-10-27T00:49:49  <bhasker> since you may have enough ships to double launch
2010-10-27T00:49:57  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=724118
2010-10-27T00:50:05  <McLeopold> bhasker: your bot is so boring
2010-10-27T00:50:10  <bhasker> lol
2010-10-27T00:50:11  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-27T00:50:13  <bhasker> its very conservative
2010-10-27T00:50:19  <bhasker> if it has an advantage
2010-10-27T00:50:21  <bhasker> it just sits
2010-10-27T00:50:28  <bhasker> till the advantage is large enough
2010-10-27T00:50:41  <bhasker> it won't acquire new neutrals
2010-10-27T00:50:52  <bhasker> and it will attack only when it can take the planet for sure
2010-10-27T00:51:05  <bhasker> a more interesting match for you
2010-10-27T00:51:05  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=724095
2010-10-27T00:51:08  <bhasker> i lost this one
2010-10-27T00:51:14  <bhasker> because i oversent to the back planet
2010-10-27T00:51:21  <bhasker> and then you launched at middle while my ships were in flight
2010-10-27T00:52:08  <McLeopold> and routed them through the +5
2010-10-27T00:52:29  <bhasker> well it didnt route through them
2010-10-27T00:52:36  <bhasker> i have some logic which looks for closest enemy
2010-10-27T00:52:39  <bhasker> and sends towards it
2010-10-27T00:52:47  <bhasker> so it sent them there before you launched
2010-10-27T00:52:52  <bhasker> so ...
2010-10-27T00:52:58  <bhasker> you had a top right planet
2010-10-27T00:53:01  <bhasker> so it sent towards it
2010-10-27T00:53:04  <bhasker> instead of back to center
2010-10-27T00:53:39  <bhasker> let me find you an interesting one to watch though
2010-10-27T00:54:12  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=704540
2010-10-27T00:54:14  <bhasker> i lost this one
2010-10-27T00:54:18  <bhasker> but its a fun one to watch
2010-10-27T00:55:54  <McLeopold> bhasker: funneling logic is very important, more important than bocsimacko's trick
2010-10-27T00:56:12  <bhasker> my funnelling logic works reasonably well
2010-10-27T00:56:19  <bhasker> the main problem though is overdefending
2010-10-27T00:56:32  <bhasker> when i defend accurately i lose when enemy has a planet closer
2010-10-27T00:56:35  <bhasker> when i over defend
2010-10-27T00:56:42  <bhasker> i get screwed like the game with you
2010-10-27T00:56:54  <bhasker> the real problem was i sent more ships to the back than required
2010-10-27T00:56:59  <TheMacca> lol - I have to figure out how to stop underdefending
2010-10-27T00:57:05  <McLeopold> next week when RamBot is done, well have to duel so you can see good funneling logic
2010-10-27T00:57:28  <bhasker> yea i have tried various combinations mc but none of them seem to work very reliabily
2010-10-27T00:57:35  <bhasker> the current one seems best
2010-10-27T00:57:40  <bhasker> seems to funnel reasonably correctly

2010-10-27T00:58:50  <bhasker> my funnel logic is reasonably good
2010-10-27T00:59:02  <bhasker> if i could get my defense right i think the bot would do much better
2010-10-27T00:59:17  <Frontier> I wonder if "Monty" codes in Python
2010-10-27T00:59:25  <McLeopold> my official just sends to the closest enemy as well.  It does work "good", but it can be better.

2010-10-27T00:59:51  <bhasker> frontier
2010-10-27T00:59:55  <bhasker> watch my attack on the central planet
2010-10-27T01:00:03  <bhasker> i should have won that
2010-10-27T01:00:15  <bhasker> but i guess my stupid laptop keeps doing stupid stuff and time out my bot at times
2010-10-27T01:01:11  <Frontier> bhasker: Well, you sent EVERYTHING to the center planet. I can't tell if you had some ships already designated to capture the second planet ^^
2010-10-27T01:01:27  <bhasker> the biggest launch is 134 ships
2010-10-27T01:01:28  <McLeopold> at least you can claim you reacted at the right time
2010-10-27T01:01:28  <bhasker> or so

2010-10-27T01:02:53  <Frontier> That's true, Monty didn't see the fleet coming or just didn't have any spare ships to support the center at that time.
2010-10-27T01:03:33  <McLeopold> bhasker: have you though of defending with just the right amount to see how that does?
2010-10-27T01:04:23  <bhasker> i tried that
2010-10-27T01:04:24  <Frontier> McLeopold: The right amount = the amount of incoming fleets on any specific turn?
2010-10-27T01:04:28  <bhasker> i lose when bots stream ships
2010-10-27T01:04:38  <bhasker> cause sometimes my planets are further away
2010-10-27T01:04:49  <bhasker> and i lose a critical planet
2010-10-27T01:04:53  <bhasker> and it goes downhill
2010-10-27T01:05:14  <bhasker> pretty much that frontier
2010-10-27T01:05:30  <bhasker> and to adjust for any growth if you are going to lose the planet
2010-10-27T01:05:40  <bhasker> i.e enemy was closer and launched massive fleet
2010-10-27T01:05:51  <Frontier> bhasker: It doesn't work there... you should have more ships on the front line anyway.
2010-10-27T01:06:05  <bhasker> well i don't redistribute ships
2010-10-27T01:06:15  <bhasker> so sometimes my edge planets don't have the optimum number
2010-10-27T01:06:17  <Frontier> bhasker: That is bad :p
2010-10-27T01:06:21  <bhasker> ^
2010-10-27T01:06:33  <bhasker> haven't figured out a good heuristic for that :-\
2010-10-27T01:06:55  <Frontier> Oh you can imagine the planets as some kind of web.
2010-10-27T01:07:09  <bhasker> well the problme is everytime you redistribute ships
2010-10-27T01:07:12  <bhasker> you lose travel time
2010-10-27T01:07:15  <bhasker> and those ships are lost
2010-10-27T01:07:17  <Frontier> You have to figure out how you can defend every node from as few nodes as possible
2010-10-27T01:07:21  <bhasker> flying between your planets
2010-10-27T01:07:31  <bhasker> yea so i do that via my staging code
2010-10-27T01:07:32  <Frontier> :( true again...
2010-10-27T01:07:42  <bhasker> since i stage to edge planets
2010-10-27T01:07:54  <bhasker> and most of my edge planets are close to the main central one
2010-10-27T01:08:04  <bhasker> so usually my central planet can send ships to support my edge
2010-10-27T01:08:20  <bhasker> but sometimes two nodes happen at extremeties of the map
2010-10-27T01:08:27  <bhasker> thats when my bot goes a bit nutty
2010-10-27T01:08:31  <bhasker> sending ships back and forst
2010-10-27T01:08:32  <bhasker> forth*
2010-10-27T01:08:39  <bhasker> from one edge to the other
2010-10-27T01:08:44  <bhasker> because it oversends ships
2010-10-27T01:08:58  <Frontier> Funny thing is: You shouldn't get into a situation where you have to stage to multiple planets from a tactical point of view.
2010-10-27T01:09:26  <bhasker> actually it makes complete sense to do so
2010-10-27T01:09:38  <bhasker> if enemy is closer then sending to central is pointless
2010-10-27T01:09:51  <bhasker> because if enemy attacks
2010-10-27T01:10:00  <bhasker> your central will never be able to reach the planet in time
2010-10-27T01:10:06  <bhasker> so its better to hold ships there
2010-10-27T01:10:08  <bhasker> and wait
2010-10-27T01:10:10  <McLeopold> bhasker: if you already can funnel to planets closer to the enemy, then you can defend exactly to planets further from the enemy.
2010-10-27T01:10:23  <bhasker> oh the problem is never for planets further
2010-10-27T01:10:27  <TheMacca> bocsimacko: 18/18
2010-10-27T01:10:30  <bhasker> the problem is for the edge planets
2010-10-27T01:10:36  <McLeopold> it was in our game
2010-10-27T01:10:49  <bhasker> hmm maybe i should do that
2010-10-27T01:11:00  <bhasker> if its not an edge planet
2010-10-27T01:11:03  <bhasker> defend exactly
2010-10-27T01:11:07  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=724095 turn 49
2010-10-27T01:11:30  <bhasker> yea cause right now i don't differentiate
2010-10-27T01:11:36  <bhasker> i was talking when i do exact defense
2010-10-27T01:11:41  <bhasker> i never have a problem defending my back planets
2010-10-27T01:11:49  <bhasker> its always the edge planets that i have trouble with
2010-10-27T01:11:53  <bhasker> since i don't redistribute

2010-10-27T01:12:13  <Frontier> Once you have to defend 2 planets and the enemy only has to defend 1 planet you lose an the advantage. I would go into offense from there as soon as possible to avoid beeing caught in a situation where my enemy sends a huge fleet to one of those half secured planets.

2010-10-27T01:59:51  <janzert> btw, I think I found the race condition that allowed a few people to end up with double entries. Basically if a second entry was made before the first was compiled they could both end up playing.
2010-10-27T02:00:10  <janzert> So the 10 minute delay had the side effect of basically fixing it.

2010-10-27T02:02:26  <amstan> new language support is kinda more important

2010-10-27T02:13:49  <amstan> it didn't go well with the sandbox and timed out..
2010-10-27T02:13:56  <janzert> yeah, I had that thought cross my mind more than once
2010-10-27T02:13:57  <amstan> you're using java, it's a risk you have to take
2010-10-27T02:14:23  <amstan> these kind of problems happen in real life too
2010-10-27T02:14:32  <janzert> at least the timeouts aren't disqualifiers now
2010-10-27T02:14:52  <amstan> it was fun when it was
2010-10-27T02:15:19  <janzert> heh, yep. pushed me into using C++ for tron

2010-10-27T05:39:24  <SamothRefoe> I'm logged in from work on my mobile phone and am thus likely to miss replies, please don't hod it against me! ;)
2010-10-27T05:41:23  <SamothRefoe> I was wondering if anyone had any news regarding possible Scala support, and what more I could do to make it more likely to happen!
2010-10-27T05:45:36  <rabidus_> i would like to play galcon as turn based
2010-10-27T05:45:50  <rabidus_> human can 30 seconds time to think own move
2010-10-27T05:47:59  <delt0r___> rabidus_: you can
2010-10-27T05:48:06  <delt0r___> agaist your own bot too
2010-10-27T05:48:51  <rabidus_> wut, how?
2010-10-27T05:49:02  <delt0r___> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=751
2010-10-27T05:49:31  <delt0r___> its not polished...
2010-10-27T05:49:34  <delt0r___> but it works
2010-10-27T05:49:42  <delt0r___> mostly
2010-10-27T05:49:44  <delt0r___> ;)
2010-10-27T05:49:48  <rabidus_> hmm.. wow
2010-10-27T05:49:53  <rabidus_> is there human vs human version?
2010-10-27T05:50:25  <delt0r___> I didn't do one... no. However if you look at the code, such a thing could be done quite easily
2010-10-27T05:50:41  <delt0r___> depending on how/if you want a network layer
2010-10-27T05:50:59  <rabidus_> it would be fantastic if it is like tcp server
2010-10-27T05:51:24  <antimatroid1> it would be cool if you could challenge the bots on the official server to a human match
2010-10-27T05:51:32  <rabidus_> yep
2010-10-27T05:51:33  <rabidus_> :)
2010-10-27T05:51:34  <antimatroid1> although that would be awesome for debugging actually
2010-10-27T05:51:44  <rabidus_> "play against THIS ONE!"
2010-10-27T05:52:02  <delt0r___> I used my play human for debug.. that was the motive
2010-10-27T05:52:27  <delt0r___> but it could easily be used to play on TCP... but without long timeouts... its very hard to win
2010-10-27T05:53:08  <lavalamp_> I think humans will suck at this game for interface reasons-- it's so hard to direct all your ships
2010-10-27T05:53:38  <delt0r___> yea
2010-10-27T05:53:52  <delt0r___> even bad bots kick my human arse...
2010-10-27T05:54:04  <delt0r___> as bender would say... stupid humans

2010-10-27T10:30:03  <cfaftw> and i love that it's written in Lisp
2010-10-27T10:30:27  <cfaftw> figures the crazy Lisp AI guy would come in at the last minute and humble everyone :)

2010-10-27T10:30:52  <cfaftw> (last minute meaning one month left :)
2010-10-27T10:31:22  <cfaftw> how's your bot coming, James?
2010-10-27T10:31:47  <JamesMG> not well, it only works if I leave in a bug in my move generation code
2010-10-27T10:31:59  <JamesMG> otherwise it generates too many possible moves and times out :)
2010-10-27T10:32:41  <JamesMG> I might go rewrite my basic heuristics bot this weekend and step away from minimax
2010-10-27T10:33:20  <cfaftw> ah
2010-10-27T10:33:27  <cfaftw> i'm still struggling with neutral selection
2010-10-27T10:34:04  <cfaftw> which... is pretty important -_-
2010-10-27T10:34:17  <JamesMG> haha, yeah
2010-10-27T10:35:03  <antimatroid1> yeah i think everyone is
2010-10-27T10:35:09  <antimatroid1> except the above mentioned person :P
2010-10-27T10:35:34  <antimatroid1> i tried to come up with a simple rock paper scissors example yesterday and even that wasn't so straigth forward
2010-10-27T10:35:39  <antimatroid1> http://i.imgur.com/p2XGG.png
2010-10-27T10:35:42  <antimatroid1> that was what i knocked up
2010-10-27T10:36:06  <JamesMG> did anyone go through lavalamp's scenario on there?
2010-10-27T10:36:15  <boegel> antimatroid1: can you elaborate on this?
2010-10-27T10:36:36  <JamesMG> I think he said 46 to the enemy planet, 27 to each neutral, but I didn't spend any time coming up with a counter to that
2010-10-27T10:36:36  <boegel> antimatroid1: what's so rock paper scissors about this example?
2010-10-27T10:36:55  <antimatroid1> i created it with it being rock paper scissors if you consider each player just picking "wait", "expand to my neutral", "expand to their neutral"
2010-10-27T10:37:05  <antimatroid1> if you consider JUST those moves from each player, it's rock paper scissors
2010-10-27T10:37:15  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure if there are any strategies that dominate those though
2010-10-27T10:37:29  <antimatroid1> yeah i never got around to it, hold on i'll run th enumbers
2010-10-27T10:37:55  <JamesMG> it would be easy to counter on turn2, but that would depend on you waiting on turn1 I think
2010-10-27T10:38:16  <antimatroid1> that counts as dominating it
2010-10-27T10:39:17  <antimatroid1> so you want to send 24 to their neutral turn 1 and 24 to your neutral turn 2
2010-10-27T10:39:45  <antimatroid1> leaving you with 54 + 10*5 = 104 when they get to you
2010-10-27T10:39:54  <antimatroid1> which is more than what they sent at you, so you'd win
2010-10-27T10:40:05  <antimatroid1> so it's not a "perfect" strategy
2010-10-27T10:41:48  <antimatroid1> i think closer starts (but not too close) are most interesting
2010-10-27T10:41:54  <antimatroid1> i also do quite badly on them so far
2010-10-27T10:41:59  <mega1> I do struggle too with neutral selection and will lose most games with a dominant middle planet.
2010-10-27T10:42:04  <JamesMG> certainly have a very "sudden death" feeling to them
2010-10-27T10:42:21  <antimatroid1> mega1: what are your thoughts on the above map?
2010-10-27T10:43:30  <mega1> attack the closer neutral with 100
2010-10-27T10:43:50  <antimatroid1> if they attack that planet first move you lose
2010-10-27T10:44:05  <antimatroid1> i agree it's better on average with imperfect bots though :P
2010-10-27T10:44:29  <mega1> then compute the mixed strategy
2010-10-27T10:44:35  <mega1> as in nash equilibrium.
2010-10-27T10:44:43  <antimatroid1> as in good luck :P
2010-10-27T10:45:06  <antimatroid1> is that why you're doing so well :P
2010-10-27T10:45:15  <antimatroid1> big numerical msne approximations? :P
2010-10-27T10:45:27  <mega1> no, nothing special I swear :-)
2010-10-27T10:45:51  <mega1> I only have plans.
2010-10-27T10:45:59  <antimatroid1> don't say that :P
2010-10-27T10:46:03  <antimatroid1> you're already miles ahead
2010-10-27T10:46:05  <mega1> that's why "Simplex" scares me so
2010-10-27T10:46:21  <antimatroid1> i don't think he's using simplex
2010-10-27T10:46:28  <antimatroid1> he was in last contest as same name
2010-10-27T10:46:35  <mega1> really?
2010-10-27T10:46:38  <antimatroid1> and someone else said they tried and was far too slow for them
2010-10-27T10:46:48  <mega1> was it jmcarthur?
2010-10-27T10:46:55  <antimatroid1> i tried doing a dynamic programming approach a while ago but that was far too slow
2010-10-27T10:46:57  <antimatroid1> not sure
2010-10-27T10:48:29  <antimatroid1> what would be cool about simplex is if you found a feasible solution that you wanted to use, you can iterate towards the optimal getting ever closer to it up to your time limit

2010-10-27T11:31:16  <antimatroid1> i don't think it's ready for it yet though
2010-10-27T11:33:29  <JamesMG> This is a new low for me, I think: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=732199
2010-10-27T11:34:04  <JamesMG> considering my old code did close starts fairly well
2010-10-27T11:35:02  <lavalamp_> JamesMG, ouch!
2010-10-27T11:35:09  <cfaftw> haha, awesome
2010-10-27T11:35:10  <antimatroid1> the "better" i make my bot the worse it gets a lot of the time
2010-10-27T11:35:14  <antimatroid1> it's very frustrating
2010-10-27T11:35:31  <cfaftw> yeah, thinks that you know should work, but in practice they don't seem to
2010-10-27T11:35:33  <cfaftw> things*
2010-10-27T11:35:48  <lavalamp_> I thought of a way to set up regression tests for for my eval function
2010-10-27T11:35:53  <JamesMG> oh yeah?
2010-10-27T11:36:11  <lavalamp_> yeah, I'll feed it two positions and test that it considers the correct one superior
2010-10-27T11:36:46  <JamesMG> I'd like to gather a mess of "turning point" game states for that at some point
2010-10-27T11:37:31  <JamesMG> need a decent number of them due to my tendancy to modify algorithms to work perfectly on my example cases... only
2010-10-27T11:37:49  <lavalamp_> my bot is going to be made of win if I can get it to stop throwing its ships at a neutral right before it loses a planet
2010-10-27T11:39:07  <antimatroid1> i just set up slack ships i can send from each planet at each point in time
2010-10-27T11:39:52  <lavalamp_> antimatroid1, I do that too

2010-10-27T11:40:22  <lavalamp_> problem is if the defense goal fails, it frees up all those ships that almost defended the planet to go do something incredibly stupid
2010-10-27T11:40:43  <lavalamp_> this is why my minimax bot is not running right now...
2010-10-27T11:41:04  <antimatroid1> i just through my stuff back into a minimax tree, but it wont do very well
2010-10-27T11:41:08  <antimatroid1> i did it in like 10 minutes
2010-10-27T11:41:24  <antimatroid1> (it was already set up previously, but i went back to heuristics cause it was so buggy)
2010-10-27T11:42:12  <lavalamp_> currently my "minimax" bot actually does something more like running a tournament between the various goals my generator comes up with
2010-10-27T11:42:43  <lavalamp_> and it's not even a minimax bot, I think it was janzert that said the term is "recursive payoff tables"
2010-10-27T11:43:18  <JamesMG> payoff matrix is kinda what I'm leaning towards now
2010-10-27T11:43:49  <lavalamp_> yeah... and mine's not very recursive since it only gets one level deep...
2010-10-27T11:44:06  <antimatroid1> atm i'm making individual moves for each player and not incrementing states
2010-10-27T11:44:11  <antimatroid1> it doesn't work very well though
2010-10-27T11:44:42  <JamesMG> when I tried to duplicate my decision process to predict the next enemy move
2010-10-27T11:44:52  <JamesMG> it played itself pretty well, but nothing else acts like it
2010-10-27T11:45:02  <jmcarthur> it certainly wasn't me saying that simplex was too slow
2010-10-27T11:45:19  <jmcarthur> i was planning to use simplex for this contest too before i decided to drop out
2010-10-27T11:45:30  <jmcarthur> and in fact had already implemented it

2010-10-27T11:50:06  <jmcarthur> so winning this contest might get me a few interviews, but not necessarily with companies i really want to deal with
2010-10-27T11:50:09  <raedwulf> ^^

2010-10-27T11:50:35  <jmcarthur> lately i've been mostly looking at research positions at unis

2010-10-27T11:50:49  <raedwulf> yea thats always a lot nicer hehe :P
2010-10-27T11:50:51  <antimatroid1> but i very rarely work as i never find the time
2010-10-27T11:50:54  <cfaftw> i feel like even being in the top 10 is resume-worthy... considering the scale of the contest

2010-10-27T11:52:12  <antimatroid1> the research i am paid to do isn't so fun (macroeconomics/programming lots of stats crap)

2010-10-27T12:36:24  <amstan> antimatroid1: yeah, maybe
2010-10-27T12:37:34  <cfaftw> oh man... i don't know if i'll have recovered by then

2010-10-27T12:58:36  <jmcarthur> me too, for the record
2010-10-27T12:58:43  <jmcarthur> although i think maybe splitting the difference would be better
2010-10-27T12:59:04  <jmcarthur> 2 months. 1 is too short. 3 seems a bit long, to me
2010-10-27T12:59:25  <antimatroid1> i dunno, this game can certainly take the 3 months
2010-10-27T12:59:29  <jmcarthur> considering how much of my productivity in other areas it tends to steal
2010-10-27T12:59:33  <antimatroid1> all the bots have a lot of improvements to be made yet
2010-10-27T12:59:35  <jmcarthur> this game could take 3 years
2010-10-27T12:59:40  <antimatroid1> :D
2010-10-27T12:59:47  <jmcarthur> but i don't want it to
2010-10-27T13:00:56  <jmcarthur> i only mean the actual contest deadline. i still think it would be nice to continue accepting entries even after the contest deadline just for fun and casual competition
2010-10-27T13:01:13  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-10-27T13:01:21  <antimatroid1> and people should be able to challenge bots to a dual
2010-10-27T13:01:30  <antimatroid1> where the human gets as long as they want to make each turn
2010-10-27T13:01:40  <antimatroid1> could even let them reverse and remake their moves maybe
2010-10-27T13:01:41  <jmcarthur> oh you mean human vs bot?
2010-10-27T13:01:44  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-10-27T13:01:58  <jmcarthur> eek, reversal means bots either can't be stateful or have to know how to rewind
2010-10-27T13:02:18  <antimatroid1> my bot resets information up each turn
2010-10-27T13:02:29  <antimatroid1> you could start my bot at any point in any game and it'd be good to go
2010-10-27T13:02:30  <jmcarthur> yeah mine wasn't going to do that at all
2010-10-27T13:02:41  <antimatroid1> mine wasn't, but then it's so messy i decided it was easier
2010-10-27T13:02:48  <antimatroid1> given i had to process the string anyway
2010-10-27T13:02:50  <jmcarthur> it was critical to retain information from turn to turn because it was going to be doing a full game analysis the whole time
2010-10-27T13:03:07  <antimatroid1> ha, there is way too much information for that
2010-10-27T13:03:12  <jmcarthur> well yeah
2010-10-27T13:03:16  <antimatroid1> we had a self updating tree for tron
2010-10-27T13:03:23  <jmcarthur> by "full game" i mean "to completion" not "all possibilities"
2010-10-27T13:03:25  <antimatroid1> but you could start generating the whole tree for that
2010-10-27T13:03:46  <antimatroid1> each turn it'd just throw out what wasn't used then keep generating from where it was at
2010-10-27T13:04:05  <jmcarthur> it was going to be an iterative algorithm that refines the "game plan" over time
2010-10-27T13:04:50  <jmcarthur> it differed from tree search in that it also refined far future moves almost independently of near future moves
2010-10-27T13:05:11  <antimatroid1> yeah fair enough
2010-10-27T13:05:23  <jmcarthur> choice of near future moves would affect the desirability of far future moves, but the search was otherwise independent
2010-10-27T13:05:25  <antimatroid1> i've considered trying to predict the other bots characteristics, but i can't see it working very well
2010-10-27T13:05:32  <jmcarthur> yeah i wasn't trying that at all
2010-10-27T13:05:44  <jmcarthur> i was just searching for an equilibrium, and then it doesn't really matter what the other bot does
2010-10-27T13:05:56  <antimatroid1> at the moment i'm making future moves at each turn, and making one move per node, so it will in a way look into the future
2010-10-27T13:06:01  <jmcarthur> i could just update the search with the actual game state as it progresses and it could adapt
2010-10-27T13:06:32  <antimatroid1> but to throw it into minimax i'm having to only execute moves to be sent at time 0
2010-10-27T13:07:06  <antimatroid1> i haven't dealt with the mess that is doing minimax with future moves
2010-10-27T13:07:12  <jmcarthur> i'm certain that tree search is pretty much completely impractical for this
2010-10-27T13:07:31  <jmcarthur> even with the most awesome pruning or opponent prediction algorithms
2010-10-27T13:07:32  <antimatroid1> i don't think so, i have built the heuristics in pretty well
2010-10-27T13:07:49  * jmcarthur shrugs
2010-10-27T13:07:59  <jmcarthur> if you say so. i abandoned tree search pretty early
2010-10-27T13:08:00  <antimatroid1> i'm basically just picking my moves, throwing each in as a child, then repeating the process
2010-10-27T13:08:17  <antimatroid1> so it will sort of chain moves together in the tree and see if that works
2010-10-27T13:10:07  <jmcarthur> basically my idea was to use particle swarm optimization to determine, for each turn of the game, what proportion of my currently available ships do i want to send to each planet. it would be a separate swarm for each player. it would simulate an entire game for each pair of particles, one from each player, making a game matrix. then it solves the game matrix and advances the particles in each
2010-10-27T13:10:09  <jmcarthur> swarm according to the weights in the result
2010-10-27T13:10:33  <jmcarthur> then repeat
2010-10-27T13:10:56  <jmcarthur> so the swarms would tend to converge on an equilibrium
2010-10-27T13:11:41  <jmcarthur> i wasn't sure how fast i could get my simulation to run. that's why i was trying to so hard to write really efficient code
2010-10-27T13:11:46  <jmcarthur> it's a lot of simulations!
2010-10-27T13:12:10  <jmcarthur> it ended up being pretty fast, although i never actually benchmarked it

2010-10-27T13:12:40  <jmcarthur> then i quit because i was spending too much time on it
2010-10-27T13:13:05  <antimatroid1> yeah fair enough
2010-10-27T13:13:39  <jmcarthur> there were lots of little details i had to get right too. the idea itself could be fragile without exactly the right heuristics, etc.
2010-10-27T13:13:47  <antimatroid1> i've considered trying to do it as a flow problem, but couldn't work out how
2010-10-27T13:13:55  <antimatroid1> same with a kind of supply/demand type thing
2010-10-27T13:14:18  <jmcarthur> the most important heuristic being: given that i have this many total ships available and these proportions to send to each planet, from which planets do i send these ships?
2010-10-27T13:15:13  <jmcarthur> "send to" also could mean "keep on" as well. like if i had 100 ships on planet A and i wanted to send 100 ships to planet A that could be a no-op
2010-10-27T13:16:28  <jmcarthur> i was also thinking of making it such that the swarm would converge more quickly on turns that are coming up soon than on turns that are still a good distance away and other little tweaks like that
2010-10-27T13:16:47  <jmcarthur> anyway, i think i have now explained most of how my bot was intended to work here
2010-10-27T13:17:53  <jmcarthur> the particle update algorithm was also slightly tweaked to favor this mixed strategy approach too. normally partical swarm assumes there is one best position, but that doesn't hold in this case
2010-10-27T13:18:15  <jmcarthur> so i had a more probabilistic update algorithm
2010-10-27T13:20:15  <jmcarthur> even if the game turns out to always have pure best strategies i think using mixed strategies in the core of my algorithm was a good idea just because it was an approximation in the first place
2010-10-27T13:20:42  <jmcarthur> any mixed strategy that comes up as a result of a poor set of games to choose from would be quickly corrected in a future iteration
2010-10-27T13:21:01  <jmcarthur> but the mixed strategy would still ensure that it doesn't try to converge on something stupid
2010-10-27T13:33:23  <raedwulf> antimatroid1: that was my initial approach
2010-10-27T13:33:27  <raedwulf> somewhat

2010-10-27T13:33:45  <raedwulf> i got so far, then realised i was complicating it too much
2010-10-27T13:34:29  <raedwulf> meh, i can't think atm, whats the initial branching factor if you start off with 100 ships and have 23 planets
2010-10-27T13:34:44  <raedwulf> i.e. how many different ways can you allocate 100 into 23
2010-10-27T13:35:57  <Zannick> 122 choose 22
2010-10-27T13:36:44  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'm not making moves like that
2010-10-27T13:37:04  <antimatroid1> each node is making like 5 moves max, and each move has a single destination planet/time
2010-10-27T13:37:17  <raedwulf> Zannick: ah... how do you work that out? :P
2010-10-27T13:37:56  <Zannick> it's something i was taught as "pirates and gold"

2010-10-27T13:38:25  <raedwulf> oh ok :P
2010-10-27T13:38:37  <raedwulf> its 9.41*10^23
2010-10-27T13:38:42  <raedwulf> interesting :D
2010-10-27T13:38:43  <Zannick> but basically, if you have k pirates, and n gold, the number of ways to parcel out the gold such that each pirate gets >= 0 pieces,
2010-10-27T13:38:56  <Zannick> it's (n + k - 1) choose (k - 1)
2010-10-27T13:39:03  <raedwulf> ah ok
2010-10-27T13:39:11  <raedwulf> nice thanks
2010-10-27T13:39:14  <Zannick> sure
2010-10-27T13:39:36  <raedwulf> 9.41*10^23 is gonna take a while hmm lol :P

2010-10-27T14:01:06  <antimatroid1> see how that goes
2010-10-27T14:01:09  <raedwulf> particularly because i sometimes want to talk to yankees and canadians which are not usually on during normal sleeping hours

2010-10-27T14:04:04  <raedwulf> maybe because it was easy

2010-10-27T14:36:31  <example> and all games stayed in that range... now all my games are against rank 100-220
2010-10-27T14:37:05  <example> it's the same for the top 100 bots... they pretty much only fight each other
2010-10-27T14:37:27  <antimatroid1> yeah, pairings are biasing like that this time
2010-10-27T14:37:35  <antimatroid1> not sure what they're planning for the final tournament

2010-10-27T14:40:37  <JamesMG> Welp, time to revert to yesterday morning again
2010-10-27T14:41:56  <Zannick> for some reason i thought you were talking about something else...
2010-10-27T14:42:12  <Zannick> real life revert to yesterday
2010-10-27T14:42:22  <JamesMG> I'd be ok with that, but Monday morning would be better
2010-10-27T14:44:24  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-10-27T14:45:25  <JamesMG> lost a table that hadn't been backed up since Oct 13th on Monday at work
2010-10-27T14:45:31  <antimatroid1> don't say that
2010-10-27T14:45:33  <JamesMG> real professional like
2010-10-27T14:45:34  <antimatroid1> i had an exam tuesday
2010-10-27T14:45:42  <JamesMG> oh ok, you can stay in the future then
2010-10-27T14:46:14  <Zannick> no, don't worry, you'll still have only taken it once ;)
2010-10-27T14:47:15  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i wonder if one could set it up as a cooperative game
2010-10-27T14:47:25  <antimatroid1> where each planet is a separate player
2010-10-27T14:47:31  <antimatroid1> then form coalitions etc.
2010-10-27T14:47:53  <JamesMG> writing bots for that would be insane
2010-10-27T14:48:04  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-10-27T14:48:07  <JamesMG> private void BackstabFriendlies(){}
2010-10-27T14:49:00  <antimatroid1> no, no, i mean same two player game
2010-10-27T14:49:05  <Zannick> no, that should be written in c++
2010-10-27T14:49:12  <Zannick> so you can have "friend" classes :D
2010-10-27T14:49:16  <JamesMG> haha
2010-10-27T14:49:16  <antimatroid1> your bot represents it's planets as separate players
2010-10-27T14:50:01  <Zannick> i've heard suggested that each planet is its own bot
2010-10-27T14:50:19  <antimatroid1> i don't like that though
2010-10-27T14:50:23  <antimatroid1> i think coordination is important
2010-10-27T14:50:29  <JamesMG> my old code almost works like that, except it coordinates for multiplanet attacks
2010-10-27T14:50:32  <Zannick> that's more or less the same thing
2010-10-27T14:50:38  <JamesMG> which really hamstrung it
2010-10-27T14:50:42  <Zannick> you have them coordinate
2010-10-27T14:50:51  <Zannick> you could even have another bot be a "general" type
2010-10-27T14:51:06  <JamesMG> a bot to plan grand strategy?
2010-10-27T14:51:29  <McLeopold> My official bot is essentially every planet for itself.
2010-10-27T14:51:32  <JamesMG> "Left flank, weaken your front planet to draw his ships in... ok, right flank strike!"
2010-10-27T14:53:01  <example> that would require enemies intelligent enough to fall for you trap - >90% aren't...

2010-10-27T14:53:53  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=734399 I really like the finish on this game.
2010-10-27T14:54:03  <McLeopold> It just looks cool.
2010-10-27T14:54:05  <amstan> sigh.. all good usernames on youtube are taken
2010-10-27T14:54:50  <JamesMG> I like the borderline pincer attack you put on there McLeopold
2010-10-27T14:54:53  <amstan> McLeopold: get a fireworks mode
2010-10-27T14:54:57  <antimatroid1> yeah i wanted to do that, once you can win, move to the centre planet then fire off
2010-10-27T14:55:03  <amstan> McLeopold: at the end, when you're about to win, yeah
2010-10-27T14:55:03  <antimatroid1> in a cirlce
2010-10-27T14:55:14  <antimatroid1> pew pew pew pew
2010-10-27T14:55:25  <antimatroid1> finish him
2010-10-27T14:55:48  <amstan> you could even do patterns with 1 sized fleets
2010-10-27T14:55:54  <amstan> during the game
2010-10-27T14:56:02  <McLeopold> voidptr already did the fireworks thing
2010-10-27T14:56:04  <amstan> it would surely confuse the enemy
2010-10-27T14:56:04  <antimatroid1> voidptr already did fireworks
2010-10-27T14:56:11  <amstan> antimatroid1: link?
2010-10-27T14:56:15  <Zannick> i saw a couple of people with fireworks
2010-10-27T14:56:16  <antimatroid1> too old
2010-10-27T14:56:22  <antimatroid1> a star would be cool
2010-10-27T14:56:24  <Zannick> a while ago
2010-10-27T14:56:37  <Zannick> but from each planet separately
2010-10-27T14:56:55  <antimatroid1> i think the centre winning sequence would be cool
2010-10-27T14:57:01  <amstan> i want links!
2010-10-27T14:57:05  <antimatroid1> i'm not doing well enough to spend time on such things yet
2010-10-27T14:57:24  <amstan> i have an idea for a good flashy thing to show people
2010-10-27T14:57:32  <amstan> get a huge map, 100 planets maybe
2010-10-27T14:57:38  <amstan> let them play for 5000 rounds
2010-10-27T14:57:39  <antimatroid1> my bot would die
2010-10-27T14:57:52  <amstan> any bot that grep 200 returns nothing
2010-10-27T14:58:27  <antimatroid1> amstan did you see this map?
2010-10-27T14:58:34  <antimatroid1> http://i.imgur.com/p2XGG.png
2010-10-27T14:58:36  <amstan> no, what map?
2010-10-27T14:58:40  <antimatroid1> try working out a best strategy for that
2010-10-27T14:59:26  <antimatroid1> i think it's isomorphic to rock paper scissors
2010-10-27T14:59:28  <antimatroid1> but i could be wrong
2010-10-27T14:59:29  <amstan> antimatroid1: send 100 ships, first turn to planet a
2010-10-27T14:59:34  <amstan> i mean to middle planet
2010-10-27T14:59:43  <antimatroid1> if the opponent sends all their ships their first move then you lose
2010-10-27T14:59:43  <McLeopold> that's easy, 100 to the closest and hold for a draw
2010-10-27T14:59:56  <amstan> if they try to attack you, you're closest so you can get there first
2010-10-27T15:00:03  <antimatroid1> yeah, but it costs you 9
2010-10-27T15:00:12  <antimatroid1> if you both move there first turn and send all growth you lose
2010-10-27T15:00:16  <antimatroid1> if they wait and you do that, you win
2010-10-27T15:00:24  <Zannick> opp sends 100 to your neutral first turn.
2010-10-27T15:00:25  <antimatroid1> etc. etc.
2010-10-27T15:00:39  <McLeopold> so, follow up with a 5 and you hold
2010-10-27T15:00:47  <antimatroid1> not if they follow up too
2010-10-27T15:01:02  <Zannick> wait, no McLeopold's right.
2010-10-27T15:01:21  <antimatroid1> no he's not
2010-10-27T15:01:23  <Zannick> you land with 91
2010-10-27T15:01:36  <antimatroid1> then you have 96 when they land
2010-10-27T15:01:36  <McLeopold> Oh, yes I am.  Growth happens before the battle.
2010-10-27T15:01:46  <Zannick> opp is 1 turn out with 100, you are one turn out with 5 and growth of 5
2010-10-27T15:01:49  <McLeopold> If it was an 11, then it would be tricky.
2010-10-27T15:02:07  <antimatroid1> no, you don't get growth when you claim a planet
2010-10-27T15:02:14  <Zannick> no, this is the next turn
2010-10-27T15:02:19  <McLeopold> you get it the next turn, before the incoming
2010-10-27T15:02:26  <antimatroid1> you claim it at turn 4 with 91 ships there, then you arrive at turn 5 when they then have 96 planets
2010-10-27T15:02:32  <antimatroid1> oh wait
2010-10-27T15:02:35  <antimatroid1> yeah, you're right :P
2010-10-27T15:02:46  <antimatroid1> add 1-4 to middle planets
2010-10-27T15:03:02  <McLeopold> at 10, it's still even.
2010-10-27T15:03:08  <McLeopold> at 11 it's tricky
2010-10-27T15:03:17  <antimatroid1> yeah shit :P
2010-10-27T15:03:19  <antimatroid1> it's late
2010-10-27T15:03:43  <antimatroid1> okay, put it at 11, then what do you do? :P
2010-10-27T15:03:50  <amstan> either way.. moving all your ships in first turn would be best bet
2010-10-27T15:03:59  <amstan> since you'll still have growth on the planet you left
2010-10-27T15:04:08  <antimatroid1> not if it's 11
2010-10-27T15:04:14  <amstan> what?
2010-10-27T15:04:16  <antimatroid1> then they can snipe you by moving there first turn
2010-10-27T15:04:31  <amstan> how though?
2010-10-27T15:04:41  <amstan> they can attack your homebase
2010-10-27T15:04:47  <amstan> but they'll loose a few ships
2010-10-27T15:04:52  <amstan> then you can send all your ships back
2010-10-27T15:04:54  <antimatroid1> no, if you both go for the neutral closest to you
2010-10-27T15:04:55  <amstan> and conquer him
2010-10-27T15:04:56  <antimatroid1> they win
2010-10-27T15:04:56  <McLeopold> if it's 11, then you can abandon to the furthur planet and you gain 5 ships overall
2010-10-27T15:05:13  <antimatroid1> change distances? :P
2010-10-27T15:05:33  <antimatroid1> my example is crumbling aha
2010-10-27T15:06:13  <McLeopold> if they attack the home base, they lose time.  You would take the center and hold with 25-35 extra ships.
2010-10-27T15:08:11  <McLeopold> Holy crap!  That's a great example.  I just thought of something!

2010-10-27T15:38:59  <JamesMG> my code is around 170 on TCP and 600s on official
2010-10-27T15:39:27  <JamesMG> 147/695 now actually

2010-10-27T17:15:07  <mega1> Mathnerd314: I'm interested in the map generator for the finals.
2010-10-27T17:15:22  <amstan> mega1: what about it?
2010-10-27T17:15:31  <Mathnerd314> indeed... constraints on the map. I know that there are <500 planets
2010-10-27T17:15:33  <lavalamp_> how are finals going to be done? will it be a tournament or based off the rankings on the server?
2010-10-27T17:15:36  <mega1> Let's declare that the current one will be used or something.
2010-10-27T17:15:53  <mega1> We need something to optimize for.
2010-10-27T17:15:58  <amstan> lavalamp_: let the servers run for a while without new submissions, then same as before
2010-10-27T17:16:05  <lavalamp_> wait, my program depends on there being no more than 23 planets...
2010-10-27T17:16:11  <mega1> And changing the map generator favors heavily certain styles.
2010-10-27T17:16:20  <lavalamp_> I wasn't here for the last one, what was it?
2010-10-27T17:16:43  <Mathnerd314> mega1: I think the point is that the bot can handle anything; specifically, it can do maps made after submissions are over
2010-10-27T17:16:59  <Mathnerd314> but... added to THE LIST
2010-10-27T17:17:19  <mega1> Mathnerd314: that's why I said "in the map _generator_" and not the maps themselves
2010-10-27T17:17:41  <lavalamp_> I really hope janzert is ok with my additions to his build script... *bites nails*
2010-10-27T17:19:05  <lavalamp_> if the generator is decent it should make maps of all kinds...
2010-10-27T17:19:29  <Zannick> the map generator is probably fine
2010-10-27T17:19:40  <Mathnerd314> yay, angry email sent.
2010-10-27T17:20:02  <lavalamp_> maybe you can do some statistics or something and choose an eval function that's best for the map
2010-10-27T17:20:03  <Zannick> unless you mean changing it by changing the number of planets, growth sizes, or max dimensions
2010-10-27T17:20:32  <lavalamp_> if number of planets changes (well, grows) it will totally screw my bot
2010-10-27T17:21:05  <mega1> Mathnerd314: oh, forgot the computational limits
2010-10-27T17:21:08  <mega1> memory/cpu

2010-10-27T17:25:50  <Mathnerd314> check the old forums; I think it was some rankings followed by a round-robin on the top n
2010-10-27T17:30:45  <mega1> judging from the results on the tcp server
2010-10-27T17:30:58  <mega1> ... with 500 games you get +-30 elo

2010-10-27T17:32:24  <mega1> last time around it was a round robin for the top 100
2010-10-27T17:32:25  <lavalamp_> eek if planet count will change for the final I need to know now... :/
2010-10-27T17:33:06  <mega1> but playing only about 100 games is +-70 elo
2010-10-27T17:33:34  <mega1> what kind of confidence interval is that?
2010-10-27T17:33:47  <lavalamp_> I don't think you can get it much lower than +/- 30...
2010-10-27T17:34:14  <Zannick> a round robin of 100 is 4950 games
2010-10-27T17:34:50  <Zannick> each player has 99 games, though
2010-10-27T17:34:56  <Zannick> so that's not quite the same
2010-10-27T17:35:04  <mega1> that's going to be pretty random
2010-10-27T17:35:17  <mega1> considering just how close scores are
2010-10-27T17:35:22  <Zannick> i was advocating round robin matches, where a match is multiple games
2010-10-27T17:35:37  <Zannick> eg 100 maps
2010-10-27T17:35:51  <Zannick> that's incredibly extreme, though
2010-10-27T17:35:55  <lavalamp_> yeah you have to settle this with a tournament, you can't choose a winner based on rating
2010-10-27T17:35:56  <mega1> with the same amount of games in total?
2010-10-27T17:36:25  <Zannick> well, it's kinda weird when you throw elo in there
2010-10-27T17:36:47  <Zannick> you could do a tournament (single/double-elim) like that
2010-10-27T17:36:57  <Zannick> but with elo it'd just be better to keep the games separate
2010-10-27T17:37:08  <Zannick> and then everyone has 9900 games
2010-10-27T17:37:20  <Zannick> or 99n games for given n

2010-10-27T17:40:39  <mega1> And we are to optimize for a certain distributions of maps.
2010-10-27T17:41:11  <mega1> that's why I'd like the map generator set in stone.
2010-10-27T17:42:05  <Zannick> well, the optimize for certain distributions isn't a requirement, it's a good idea for the tournament, though
2010-10-27T17:42:13  <Zannick> where tournament = contest

2010-10-27T18:05:15  *** Apophis <Apophis!~apophis@80-219-211-230.dclient.hispeed.ch> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2010-10-27T18:06:56  <javagamer_cpp> My planets are stored in a hash table and several vectors have references to them
2010-10-27T18:07:15  <Zannick> references or copies?
2010-10-27T18:07:23  <lavalamp_> or pointers?
2010-10-27T18:07:51  <lavalamp_> hm, I don't think you need a hash table for 23 planets :)
2010-10-27T18:07:57  <javagamer_cpp> Aren't pointers references?  I have several vectors of pointers to the planets
2010-10-27T18:08:10  <Zannick> okay
2010-10-27T18:08:19  <Zannick> and no, they're not the same :)
2010-10-27T18:08:22  <lavalamp_> confusingly, no not in the technical sense
2010-10-27T18:08:41  <lavalamp_> int *p = &i // p is a pointer
2010-10-27T18:08:47  <Zannick> but pointers are fine.
2010-10-27T18:08:51  <lavalamp_> int& r = i; //r is a reference
2010-10-27T18:10:23  <Zannick> unfortunately, it isn't going to be clear where your problem is. it could be that the declaration is doing something funky to your planets, but it's just as possible that something else is happening with your stack
2010-10-27T18:10:46  <lavalamp_> agree-- this bug will be hard to find
2010-10-27T18:11:12  <javagamer_cpp> :/
2010-10-27T18:11:23  <lavalamp_> welcome to C++
2010-10-27T18:11:37  <Zannick> common reasons for blowing your stack include: declaring large arrays in functions, recursing too deeply, some combination of both
2010-10-27T18:12:01  <javagamer_cpp> Could it be related to code like this: http://pastebin.com/DRrAEVxJ
2010-10-27T18:12:12  <lavalamp_> I spent my morning fixing a heap corruption...

2010-10-27T18:12:30  <javagamer_cpp> I did stuff like that a few times and I felt really worried it would break something
2010-10-27T18:13:05  <Zannick> hm
2010-10-27T18:13:23  <Zannick> planet->incomingOrders.begin() + i
2010-10-27T18:13:26  <Zannick> seems suspect to me
2010-10-27T18:13:28  <javagamer_cpp> The idea there is to remove all orders from the vector that meet a certain qualification
2010-10-27T18:13:49  <Zannick> that doesn't quite work like you'd expect, i think, though i'm not sure it's the same problem
2010-10-27T18:13:55  <a1k0n> Mathnerd314: you missed a perfect opportunity for 'WHAT is your favorite colour?'
2010-10-27T18:13:58  <javagamer_cpp> Zannick, that seems to be how it's done, http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/erase/
2010-10-27T18:14:16  <Mathnerd314> a1k0n: yeah, was wondering if anyone would catch that :p
2010-10-27T18:14:18  <a1k0n> also lol i'm famous
2010-10-27T18:14:25  <lavalamp_> it looks weird, yeah, but I think it will work
2010-10-27T18:14:34  <Mathnerd314> a1k0n: famous? where and how?
2010-10-27T18:14:47  <a1k0n> 16:14 < JamesMG> and a1k0n is pretty famous now
2010-10-27T18:14:54  <lavalamp_> maybe not efficiently, but I think it will work
2010-10-27T18:15:03  * Zannick shrug
2010-10-27T18:15:26  <javagamer_cpp> lavalamp_, I'd love to hear if you know of a more efficient way to accomplish the same thing
2010-10-27T18:15:57  <javagamer_cpp> I'd considered sorting first, but I figured it would result in a net loss of time, though the code would certainly look nicer
2010-10-27T18:16:05  <lavalamp_> if it's a short list, it doesn't matter
2010-10-27T18:16:25  <javagamer_cpp> Yeah, I assumed it should stay rather short
2010-10-27T18:16:26  <Zannick> but i don't think that is the problem
2010-10-27T18:16:41  <lavalamp_> then don't worry about it
2010-10-27T18:16:54  <lavalamp_> "it's easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code"
2010-10-27T18:17:11  <javagamer_cpp> I'm pretty sure it has to do with the two vectors of orders b/c afaik it was working before that
2010-10-27T18:17:23  <javagamer_cpp> I'll try commenting them out and seeing if it starts working then
2010-10-27T18:17:24  <lavalamp_> this is not your corruption source, agreed
2010-10-27T18:17:50  <Zannick> with stack corruption, any modification will tear something new
2010-10-27T18:18:32  <lavalamp_> yeah that may not be a good test.
2010-10-27T18:19:03  <lavalamp_> you could try moving the int x=0; line around in your code, try to narrow down where you can place it and still cause the issue
2010-10-27T18:19:28  <Zannick> are you using recursion anywhere?
2010-10-27T18:20:23  <javagamer_cpp> Zannick, not purposefully, but I might be accidentally, I'll check for that
2010-10-27T18:20:57  <Zannick> well, i mean functions that call themselves (or other functions that call them back...)
2010-10-27T18:21:29  <Zannick> every function call adds to the stack, so it's a very easy way to blow it
2010-10-27T18:21:38  <Zannick> (i used to do that often in java)
2010-10-27T18:21:41  <javagamer_cpp> Zannick, I have lots of functions calling lots of other functions, I didn't plan any recursion yet, but I might accidentally have something calling something that recalls the original thing or something

2010-10-27T18:22:46  <javagamer_cpp> I originally found this when I noticed one thing would time out when it should go really quickly, so something like that could very well be happening
2010-10-27T18:23:04  <lavalamp_> my guess is it's an out of bound array access to something on the stack...

2010-10-27T18:25:09  <lavalamp_> you might consider using indexes to an array of planets instead of direct pointers... easier to catch if you do something wrong.
2010-10-27T18:25:19  <javagamer_cpp> lavalamp_, could that be caused with vectors as well b/c I'm using very few arrays
2010-10-27T18:25:44  <lavalamp_> std::vector should catch that but who knows what exactly you're doing...
2010-10-27T18:26:09  <lavalamp_> anyway I gotta go... good luck

2010-10-27T19:17:21  <Mathnerd314> and... out of the blue, he changes turn limit to 400 :p
2010-10-27T19:17:39  <Zannick> unfortunately, though, he isn't.
2010-10-27T19:17:54  <Zannick> though we would like him to be if he's going to change things like that
2010-10-27T19:19:09  <a1k0n> yeah what the hell, 400 turns?  i hope i just talked him out of that
2010-10-27T19:19:43  <a1k0n> data: http://a1k0n.net/temp/galcon_histogram.png
2010-10-27T19:19:58  <a1k0n> (i actually have since accumulated a lot more games and so i guess i could re-run that)
2010-10-27T19:22:03  <Mathnerd314> what was the turn limit for Tron? IIRC the maps were 20x20, so... 400/2 = 200
2010-10-27T19:22:27  <a1k0n> the initial maps were 15x15
2010-10-27T19:23:01  <a1k0n> and they all had border walls
2010-10-27T19:23:06  <Mathnerd314> a1k0n: how did you make that histogram? scraping the site again?
2010-10-27T19:23:22  <Zannick> is the vertical axis number of games?
2010-10-27T19:23:25  <amstan> Mathnerd314: keep in mind that we have 7 times more people and crappier servers
2010-10-27T19:23:33  <a1k0n> well, it's scraped from benzedrine.cx so it could arguably be biased
2010-10-27T19:23:34  <amstan> Zannick: number of games ending
2010-10-27T19:23:44  <Zannick> yeah, what i thought
2010-10-27T19:23:56  <a1k0n> yeah the green line is on a separate scale
2010-10-27T19:24:05  <amstan> a1k0n: this is decent, benzedrine players would be more concerned with it
2010-10-27T19:24:12  <a1k0n> right, that's what i figured
2010-10-27T19:24:18  <Zannick> oh
2010-10-27T19:24:26  <amstan> so yeah, 90% games end before 200 turns
2010-10-27T19:24:48  <a1k0n> and of the remainder, probably a good 5-8% of them would just go on forever

2010-10-27T19:25:09  <a1k0n> there are games where they clearly would have ended on ilke turn 250

2010-10-27T19:25:29  <amstan> good point
2010-10-27T19:25:30  <Zannick> i don't think the benefits of 400 turns outweight the costs
2010-10-27T19:25:37  <amstan> they don't
2010-10-27T19:25:38  <a1k0n> i don't think it's even possible to turn the game around after, say, turn 100

2010-10-27T19:41:39  <amstan> lavalamp_: he ran away when he saw it
2010-10-27T19:42:08  <amstan> he said something among the lines "nooooooo!"

2010-10-27T19:51:23  <amstan> and it's not that easy to setup, the bot actually dumps the log in real time
2010-10-27T19:51:35  <amstan> unless i have a cronjob to convert all of them every 5 minutes
2010-10-27T19:51:54  <Mathnerd314> right.. you just run the script. (and daily works fine IMO)

2010-10-27T22:48:32  <antimatroid> hmm, i'm not sure representing it as a normal form zero sum game is any different to usign the tree
2010-10-27T22:48:38  <antimatroid> unless chasing after mixed strategies to sue
2010-10-27T22:51:16  <davidjliu> how's the treebot coming along?
2010-10-27T22:51:21  <dmj111> yeah, it is not real clear.
2010-10-27T22:51:53  <antimatroid> tree bot sucks
2010-10-27T22:51:57  <antimatroid> i'm rethinking aha
2010-10-27T22:53:18  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure minimax on the tree will get you all psne anyway wont it?

2010-10-27T23:02:06  <antimatroid> pure strategy nash equilibrium
2010-10-27T23:04:26  <dmj111> If one exists, then the minimax tree should find it.  The simultaneous moves makes things confusing though.
2010-10-27T23:05:34  <dmj111> Maybe a payoff matrix would make sense, just for the simul moves.  But, searching multiple ply with full payoff matrices seems harder.
2010-10-27T23:06:05  <dmj111> I tried figuring out a way to to alpha-beta pruning of mixed strategies for tron.  Every now and then I got my hopes up.  And then dashed them to pieces.
2010-10-27T23:07:27  <antimatroid> actually, you can go through and eliminate pure dominated strategies before finding mixed strategy nash equilibria
2010-10-27T23:07:29  <antimatroid> that might help
2010-10-27T23:08:58  <eburnette_> I don't think this game has NE because there's no best unchanging strategy
2010-10-27T23:10:00  <lavalamp_> eburnette_, individual moves do though, probably most of the time
2010-10-27T23:10:37  <eburnette_> Argh: INFO You LOSE against bocsimacko-b0.30

2010-10-27T23:14:48  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: oh, you are assuming that mix strategies are a superset of pure strategies?
2010-10-27T23:14:52  <jmcarthur> (mixed
2010-10-27T23:14:55  <antimatroid> every finite normal form game has a mixed strategy nash equilibria
2010-10-27T23:14:55  <jmcarthur> **mixed
2010-10-27T23:14:57  <jmcarthur> gah
2010-10-27T23:15:03  <antimatroid> yeah, well they are :P
2010-10-27T23:15:24  <jmcarthur> normally i say mixed strategy to mean "not a pure strategy"
2010-10-27T23:15:31  <jmcarthur> but i suppose that is incorrect
2010-10-27T23:15:31  <antimatroid> finding it is not so easy, that's my intended honours thesis topic next year, hello grobner bases
2010-10-27T23:15:44  <antimatroid> although gambit uses newtons method for getting ne
2010-10-27T23:16:06  <antimatroid> pure strategies are mixed strategies in a way
2010-10-27T23:16:20  <jmcarthur> yeah, a degenerate form of mixed strategy
2010-10-27T23:16:28  <antimatroid> still a mixed strategy :P
2010-10-27T23:16:34  <jmcarthur> no disagreement

2010-10-27T23:29:20  <McLeopold> on turn 40, you sent 59 ships backwards to take a neutral
2010-10-27T23:29:32  <McLeopold> twice
2010-10-27T23:31:02  <McLeopold> on turn 36, you send 49 to your main planet, which opened a small hole, but would have been recoverable
2010-10-27T23:32:07  <McLeopold> so, in a matter of 2 turns (39, 40) you attempt to take 2 back line neutral and an enemy planet far away.
2010-10-27T23:32:16  <eburnette_> I sent the 70 because the planet looked vulnerable
2010-10-27T23:32:44  <McLeopold> Yeah, maybe, but you can't leave yourself open when it's that close.
2010-10-27T23:33:01  <McLeopold> Maybe just taking 1 planet at a time would've worked.
2010-10-27T23:34:09  <McLeopold> If that 70 had done up to the 8+4 planet that just sent the 89, that might have been better
2010-10-27T23:34:13  <McLeopold> It was closer
2010-10-27T23:36:17  <eburnette_> Or if I hadn't sent either of the 59's
2010-10-27T23:37:04  <McLeopold> Those were really bad.  You might have still lost the center because of that 70.
2010-10-27T23:37:17  <eburnette_> Ooh I think I know why I did the 59's, I can fix that
2010-10-27T23:37:44  <McLeopold> You also need a simple check to make sure you don't capture a planet twice.
2010-10-27T23:37:57  <McLeopold> Actually, my official bot does that. :(
2010-10-27T23:39:27  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=741025
2010-10-27T23:40:46  <McLeopold> turn 49, you give up the center again by sending 142 across the map
2010-10-27T23:41:02  <McLeopold> lucky for you, my bot was dumber. :P
2010-10-27T23:41:02  <eburnette_> I don't think you're doing dup moves because I keep taking back
2010-10-27T23:42:01  <davidjliu> So, I re-uploaded my bot, and it's... rank 3674. oh yeah
2010-10-27T23:42:11  <McLeopold> and climbing?
2010-10-27T23:42:17  <davidjliu> heh, well it played one game
2010-10-27T23:42:30  <davidjliu> a clutch first-turn timeout victory
2010-10-27T23:42:42  <davidjliu> I'm thinking a quick reupload is in order in another 10 minutes...
2010-10-27T23:42:45  <McLeopold> that probably dropped you rank alot...
2010-10-27T23:42:58  <McLeopold> That just means you start over
2010-10-27T23:43:09  <davidjliu> heh, yeah
2010-10-27T23:43:12  <eburnette_> I hate the official server, sooooo sloooow
2010-10-27T23:44:19  <antimatroid> my bot crashes on the main server at the moment
2010-10-27T23:44:23  <antimatroid> i need to fix that at some point
2010-10-27T23:44:30  <antimatroid> the main server has been horrible this time around

2010-10-27T23:44:49  <davidjliu> heh, sounds like a plan
2010-10-27T23:45:04  <McLeopold> I'd be willing to fire up AntBot if you do.
2010-10-27T23:45:07  <eburnette_> be sure you get delt0r's viewer
2010-10-27T23:45:19  <McLeopold> I should check that out.
2010-10-27T23:45:35  <antimatroid> i'm trying a new approach
2010-10-27T23:45:52  <antimatroid> so it'll be a while, i'll throw the horrible thing i made last night up though
2010-10-27T23:45:55  <davidjliu> it's goin up.. .probably just for 10-15 minutes-ish
2010-10-27T23:46:23  <davidjliu> hopefully my changes didn't make it suck
2010-10-27T23:46:31  <McLeopold> hmm... let's see of AntBot can play a game without a timeout...
2010-10-27T23:46:39  <antimatroid> there you go :P
