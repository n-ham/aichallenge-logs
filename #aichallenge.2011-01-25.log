2011-01-25T09:41:26  <delt0r_> since it didn't sound like it would be taken seriously
2011-01-25T09:41:46  <delt0r_> So i have been polishing it more for a comercial release

2011-01-25T11:21:40  <delt0r_> what are your thoughts?
2011-01-25T11:22:21  <delt0r_> i mean even with stratego begin a hard sell i can't imagin a 3 ship type rts getting any consideration time
2011-01-25T11:29:44  <aerique> i don't know, it would have my preference
2011-01-25T11:29:58  <aerique> and it's less units types than stratego :)
2011-01-25T11:30:14  <aerique> anyway, i've got to go

2011-01-25T11:49:55  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: i don't know many details about your rts, actually. is there a writeup anywhere?
2011-01-25T11:50:08  <delt0r_> no
2011-01-25T11:50:12  <delt0r_> other than irc
2011-01-25T11:51:17  <delt0r_> you have fighters, gunships, artillery and destroyers. The goal is to destory the other guys mother ship
2011-01-25T11:51:51  <delt0r_> you have crude physics for movement
2011-01-25T11:52:02  <delt0r_> and you are fighting in a nebular
2011-01-25T11:52:37  <delt0r_> so all terrian is passable... but a bit of A* would help a lot since "clouds and dust" make you go slower
2011-01-25T11:53:03  <delt0r_> you only can see things within visual range and not occluded by too much dust
2011-01-25T11:53:08  <delt0r_> thats about it
2011-01-25T11:53:12  <delt0r_> oh and 2d
2011-01-25T12:04:50  <jmcarthur> it sounds fun to me
2011-01-25T12:05:03  <jmcarthur> i can see why some might not be in favor of it though
2011-01-25T12:05:11  <jmcarthur> sounds like it would be difficult to get started with
2011-01-25T12:05:37  <jmcarthur> i personally would love it though, from the sound of it

2011-01-25T12:11:22  <delt0r_> I think that a basic random bot and a rage bot are not so bad..
2011-01-25T12:11:31  <delt0r_> Its very little code for either
2011-01-25T12:11:46  <delt0r_> but if you wan't to do something fancy with the terrain...
2011-01-25T12:12:19  <delt0r_> or I could simplify it by only having fighters... then its space cowboy dogfight
2011-01-25T12:12:20  <delt0r_> !
2011-01-25T12:12:58  <delt0r_> but the basic physics does make it a bit harder... rather than turn based movement.
2011-01-25T12:13:06  <delt0r_> I mean grid based
2011-01-25T12:13:24  <delt0r_> its turn based... just not grid based.
