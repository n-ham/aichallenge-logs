2012-06-27T10:01:21  <Girffe> safe to assume it's kind of dead at the moment?
2012-06-27T10:03:33  <ronchamon> afaik the last challenge was last year.
2012-06-27T10:03:47  <ronchamon> And I should know, since I took part.
2012-06-27T10:05:58  <mleise> Griffe: The last two constest were "Planet Wars" and "Ants", and both were a lot of fun :D

2012-06-27T10:07:25  <ronchamon> I missed the Planet Wars. :(
2012-06-27T10:07:32  <mleise> But it is correct, that the contest is on hold until further notice.
2012-06-27T10:07:34  <ronchamon> I noticed it when there was 3 days remaining.
2012-06-27T10:08:19  <mleise> ronchamon: I came late for it, too. But I made got an acceptable place in the end ~300 I think
2012-06-27T10:09:49  <mleise> I liked it so much, that I helped with the development of Ants in the next year.
2012-06-27T10:10:39  <mleise> That said, the more people volunteer to help the better. But that's not the hold up at the moment I think. I have not followed it much recently

2012-06-27T10:31:36  <delt0r> mleise: is sort of on hold since putting a lot of time into things that don't get used is not going to help
2012-06-27T10:32:27  <mleise> delt0r: what does not get used?
2012-06-27T10:32:41  <mleise> You sound like there wont be another contest
2012-06-27T10:33:17  <delt0r> I hope there will be... but unless jeff comes out from what ever rock he is under... it will be hard to have another one at all
2012-06-27T10:33:36  <delt0r> really we need him to pass the mantel over as it were
2012-06-27T10:33:56  <mleise> So... let's just say "Hi Jeff. We take over the contest from you, k? thx."
2012-06-27T10:34:19  <mleise> with me I mean amstan and company
2012-06-27T10:34:23  <delt0r> we tried that ---he doesn't like it then makes everything different
2012-06-27T10:34:24  <mleise> sorry, *we
2012-06-27T10:34:40  <delt0r> I thought you tried it
2012-06-27T10:34:46  <delt0r> as ants
2012-06-27T10:35:06  <mleise> I wasn't involved. Amstan would know better.
2012-06-27T10:35:10  <delt0r> k
2012-06-27T10:35:24  <mleise> where is HE nowadays?
2012-06-27T10:35:33  <delt0r> ?
2012-06-27T10:35:39  <delt0r> who knows...
2012-06-27T10:35:49  <delt0r> well amstan does turn up now and then
2012-06-27T10:35:50  <mleise> all the regulars disappear
2012-06-27T10:35:57  <mleise> k
2012-06-27T10:36:36  <delt0r> I am keen to help a bit, but not if means getting railroaded at the last min because someone finally decieded to check their email
2012-06-27T10:36:52  <mleise> fair enough :)
2012-06-27T10:37:14  <delt0r> I was hoping to run into Amstan and co face to face, will be in Toronto next month
2012-06-27T10:37:41  <mleise> do you live far from there?
2012-06-27T10:37:48  <delt0r> Austria?
2012-06-27T10:37:50  <delt0r> is that far?
2012-06-27T10:37:52  <delt0r> :D
2012-06-27T10:38:09  <mleise> oh right, I remember you were german speaker
2012-06-27T10:38:11  <delt0r> I am from NZ and only got back from a trip a few weeks ago... now that is far
2012-06-27T10:38:42  <delt0r> Me? no i can't speak a word of the language... unless i am ording a beer
2012-06-27T10:38:56  <delt0r> Even so i have lived here for 6 years now
2012-06-27T10:39:04  <mleise> really? then I only remembered the austria in the back of the attic
2012-06-27T10:39:13  <delt0r> will be moving to Switzerland soon
2012-06-27T10:39:35  <mleise> oh, maybe your french or italian is better then?
2012-06-27T10:39:44  <mleise> :p
2012-06-27T10:40:02  <delt0r> no yet anyway... but since i know i will be there for 4 years... i will put a bit more effort into it
2012-06-27T10:40:16  <delt0r> I have only had one year contracts here...
2012-06-27T10:40:48  <mleise> ok, it would be nice if the contest continued, but it looks like with no Jeff or official Google sponsoring it is difficult to get things planned and done.

2012-06-27T10:41:23  <delt0r> If we could get the "jeff is standing down" i think there is more than enough of us to make it work personally
2012-06-27T10:41:35  <mleise> so you moved to europe for one year contracts? did you work for the same company in NZ?
2012-06-27T10:41:42  <delt0r> or if jeff would just i don't know ---answer a bloody email...
2012-06-27T10:41:55  <delt0r> mleise: I work at uni
2012-06-27T10:41:59  <delt0r> PostDoc
2012-06-27T10:42:17  <mleise> ok, i get the picture
2012-06-27T10:42:56  <mleise> is jeff even alive? maybe he got kidnapped or thrown into a river with a block of concrete around his feet
2012-06-27T10:43:00  <delt0r> For example i think we can easily wrangle up enough support for servers and things...It does take time however
2012-06-27T10:43:26  <mleise> enough *monetary* support for servers? or just people to run them?
2012-06-27T10:43:27  <delt0r> mleise: They did have a meeting a few months ago i was told
2012-06-27T10:43:52  <delt0r> the result was "we should have a more serious meeting soon" ... it never did happen
2012-06-27T10:44:00  <mleise> *sigh*
2012-06-27T10:44:03  <delt0r> cash is just for the servers
2012-06-27T10:44:14  <delt0r> EC2 instances and the web server
2012-06-27T10:44:17  <mleise> of course
2012-06-27T10:44:54  <delt0r> I think i could get a uni behind it, and then use some of the cluster resources we have
2012-06-27T10:45:19  <delt0r> Case in point i would be willing to *try* and get a uni behind it
2012-06-27T10:45:22  <mleise> that would be really nice. they are often unused I've been told
2012-06-27T10:45:43  <delt0r> well some are, some are not. the 6k core one is pretty full a lot of the time
2012-06-27T10:45:55  <delt0r> the 500core one i have is often empty
2012-06-27T10:46:00  <delt0r> esp in summer
2012-06-27T10:46:12  <mleise> You know if you got the Minecraft inventor behind the challenge, everyone would suddenly want to support it
2012-06-27T10:46:24  <delt0r> well i do know him from IRC
2012-06-27T10:46:38  <delt0r> he kinda a bit aloft these days...
2012-06-27T10:46:55  <mleise> even github proudly supports DCPU16 assembly, it *is* rediculous :p
2012-06-27T10:47:03  <delt0r> lol
2012-06-27T10:47:15  <delt0r> yea--use the fame luke
2012-06-27T10:47:21  <delt0r> stupid force
2012-06-27T10:47:55  <delt0r> I think the ai challenge is pretty popular as is... and 2x a year it would get very popular
2012-06-27T10:48:12  <delt0r> at least more popular than there cash/servers
2012-06-27T10:48:38  <delt0r> mleise: how much of that is having googles name in the comp do you think?
2012-06-27T10:48:54  <mleise> no idea, but I think a lot
2012-06-27T10:49:16  <delt0r> I am inclined to agree...
2012-06-27T10:49:17  <mleise> People associate quality of service with the name
2012-06-27T10:49:24  <delt0r> that is really jeff;s bit
2012-06-27T10:49:27  <mleise> fairness, good uptime
2012-06-27T10:49:54  <delt0r> I could do EU ai challenge --but without the google..... hard to know if anyone would give a crap
2012-06-27T10:50:04  <mleise> Even with the "Google is the new Microsoft" phrases, it is a strong "brand"
2012-06-27T10:50:19  <delt0r> indeed
2012-06-27T10:50:56  <delt0r> either way. It would be better to not split off...
2012-06-27T10:51:24  <delt0r> i just can't shake the feeling that its the only way to get this as responsive as the players want it to be
2012-06-27T10:52:12  <delt0r> say 2 comps a year. One major and one minor
2012-06-27T10:52:27  <mleise> We need a solid framework for this
2012-06-27T10:52:44  <mleise> if we keep reinventing as much, we cannot keep up with this rate
2012-06-27T10:52:48  <delt0r> we do have people who want to work on that. ie me
2012-06-27T10:52:50  <mleise> like the scoring system
2012-06-27T10:53:17  <delt0r> and really its not much of a frame work... what was it last time.. less than 10k people
2012-06-27T10:53:18  <mleise> we used a lot of time in the past to find algorithms and test
2012-06-27T10:54:01  <delt0r> yea... and that will kinda always be a point of "conflict" or change
2012-06-27T10:54:08  <mleise> a framework for contests, I mean. so you can quickly replace the game engine and parts of the visualizer and get the next contest up and running
2012-06-27T10:54:28  <delt0r> with a basic framework however the new things can be rolled forward slowly and reliably.
2012-06-27T10:55:06  <delt0r> yea... seriously its not a hard web project. Its something i would give a competent summer student to do
2012-06-27T10:55:16  <delt0r> also something that could be done with a uni backing it
2012-06-27T10:56:04  <delt0r> mleise: I was ready to do such a framework when even amstan? said to wait and see what is up with jeff
2012-06-27T10:56:06  <mleise> I've been told that the "cost" of software has several dimensions, like interfaces, scalability etc.
2012-06-27T10:56:20  <delt0r> it was going to use one of the python web frameworks
2012-06-27T10:56:36  <delt0r> since that seems like what most would want
2012-06-27T10:56:57  <mleise> if one student coded it up as a sumer project, it would have one interface, it won't scale and the Jeff dimension isn't even talked about :p
2012-06-27T10:57:01  <delt0r> mleise: i use to work on some very large web/network things
2012-06-27T10:57:22  <mleise> ok I trust you on that
2012-06-27T10:57:55  <mleise> although I already feel this urge to look at what you are coding up and do the usual bike shedding ^^
2012-06-27T10:58:01  <delt0r> something like this is not so hard. Since only the web server needs fancy multi stuff and something like is been done to death
2012-06-27T10:58:20  <delt0r> I didn't code anything in the end
2012-06-27T10:58:56  <delt0r> the idea was to keep it pretty simple.. scaling was to be achieved by adding game servers
2012-06-27T10:59:00  <mleise> don't forget the offline stuff, TCP server/client, local testing and visualization, installers
2012-06-27T10:59:30  <delt0r> yea. again we have people who want to do this... for whatever game gets decided on..
2012-06-27T10:59:30  <mleise> I see, I know too little about web servers
2012-06-27T11:00:04  <delt0r> I really don't know why so many companies stuff up web serving... we have been doing a really long time now
2012-06-27T11:00:20  <mleise> what does stuff up mean?
2012-06-27T11:00:25  <delt0r> either way... clean readable code... that is where it all start
2012-06-27T11:00:56  <delt0r> stuff up means there server dies when they get a few 100 people using the web site at the same time...
2012-06-27T11:01:15  <delt0r> say when they do a product release at a big press conference
2012-06-27T11:01:17  <mleise> ah ok. i have an idea

2012-06-27T11:01:47  <delt0r> really getting /. or digged should not bring a server down
2012-06-27T11:01:56  <mleise> their frameworks are uber productive, but a "little" slower than others
2012-06-27T11:02:01  <delt0r> perhaps a little slower... but not down
2012-06-27T11:02:12  <mleise> no
2012-06-27T11:02:29  <mleise> and anything they buy should be pretty secure already
2012-06-27T11:03:05  <delt0r> security is another thing... at least don't use any of the crap php forum software and your a winner...
2012-06-27T11:03:07  <mleise> although our TCP server for ants had security issues as well as I pointed out by downloading /bin/bash :p
2012-06-27T11:03:20  <thestinger> the tcp server was pretty bad
2012-06-27T11:03:24  <delt0r> only everyone uses the php fourm software
2012-06-27T11:03:34  <delt0r> thestinger: yea... but it is just for testing
2012-06-27T11:03:49  <mleise> thestinger: hehe, it was fun anyway and nothing happened
2012-06-27T11:05:05  <delt0r> but non of these things matter as much as sorting out the Jeff issue... he is the boss and he won't answer the phone
2012-06-27T11:05:26  <delt0r> I really think we have more than enough people to make it work
2012-06-27T11:05:39  <mleise> I'm following the D news group and found this to be interesting: http://vibed.org/ . They basically go back to native code execution for the web server.
2012-06-27T11:06:10  <mleise> delt0r: and I guess out of this frustration you imagined the EU ai challenge?
2012-06-27T11:06:21  <delt0r> yea
2012-06-27T11:06:32  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-239-61.dynamic.chello.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2012-06-27T11:06:39  <mleise> oh and maybe because of the EM ;)
2012-06-27T11:06:40  <delt0r> but i don't want to upset anyone...
2012-06-27T11:06:45  <delt0r> or do I?
2012-06-27T11:06:53  <delt0r> ? EM
2012-06-27T11:06:57  <thestinger> mleise: does that use libuv?
2012-06-27T11:07:09  <mleise> soccer champions league
2012-06-27T11:07:19  <thestinger> oh, it doesn't atm but the author plans on adding a driver for it
2012-06-27T11:08:06  <delt0r> mleise: the only thing with different web servers etc is that we kinda decided to stick with python for the sake of consistency
2012-06-27T11:08:46  <delt0r> but yea, there are a lot of quite solid, scalable solutions out there.
2012-06-27T11:08:56  <mleise> That's not what I wanted to hint to :). It's just an example of how to make web servers as responsive as possible
2012-06-27T11:09:46  <delt0r> oh right... yea a lot of enterprise more or less does that
2012-06-27T11:10:26  <mleise> I only know of ... Facebook? that compile to PHP to C (again: ?) code.
2012-06-27T11:10:49  <delt0r> well that is a different scale again...
2012-06-27T11:11:07  <thestinger> mleise: well, they compile it to C++ but afaik they also have a lot of actual C++ code
2012-06-27T11:11:16  <thestinger> and they're probably moving towards that and away from php
2012-06-27T11:11:57  <thestinger> https://github.com/facebook/folly/tree/master/folly they released that a while ago (some random internal C++11 stuff they use)
2012-06-27T11:12:04  <delt0r> web apps are IO bound thou... can see a big advantage of C++ over say Java, or scala or some other cache compiled lang
2012-06-27T11:12:58  <mleise> @author Andrei Alexandrescu. I see him often on the D news group and IRC
2012-06-27T11:12:58  <contestbot> mleise: Error: 'Andrei' is not a valid plugin.
2012-06-27T11:12:58  <delt0r> perhaps some fancy C kernal calls in linux could get some big gains... aka git
2012-06-27T11:13:28  *** mcstar <mcstar!~mcstar@adsl-89-135-199-85.monradsl.monornet.hu> has joined #aichallenge
2012-06-27T11:13:43  <mleise> He is one of those C++ gurus
2012-06-27T11:13:56  <thestinger> mleise: and apparently works for facebook now :P
2012-06-27T11:14:02  * thestinger finds that funny
2012-06-27T11:14:09  <mleise> he never hid that
2012-06-27T11:14:32  <delt0r> mleise: do you use D a bit?
2012-06-27T11:14:33  <mleise> but he pitties that he doesn't have enough time for his projects
2012-06-27T11:14:41  <thestinger> delt0r: a bit? :)
2012-06-27T11:14:49  <delt0r> lol
2012-06-27T11:14:51  <mleise> Yes, I used it bit by bit
2012-06-27T11:14:59  <thestinger> D is a pretty nice language
2012-06-27T11:15:02  <mleise> I manage the package for Gentoo currently
2012-06-27T11:15:12  <delt0r> right...
2012-06-27T11:15:12  <mleise> D2, that is
2012-06-27T11:15:44  <delt0r> well i do a lot of R too ... we could combine the packages and have R2D2
2012-06-27T11:15:45  <mleise> I couldn't go back to using "vector<vector<int>>"
2012-06-27T11:15:56  <mleise> delt0r: lol
2012-06-27T11:16:32  <mleise> "R2D2 - the fine programming languages pack"
2012-06-27T11:16:39  <delt0r> hehe
2012-06-27T11:17:17  <mleise> It does have rough corners, like the missing implementation of the "shared" attribute
2012-06-27T11:17:34  <mleise> Some things that look great on paper, prove difficult to implement
2012-06-27T11:18:03  <delt0r> every lang has some rough edges ... its just how close to those edges you need to when solving what ever it is your doing
2012-06-27T11:18:15  <delt0r> in C++ is seems like all rough edges...
2012-06-27T11:18:33  <delt0r> C feels like glorified Assembly
2012-06-27T11:18:47  <mleise> Actually I like how Java stayed true to its concept for many years
2012-06-27T11:18:52  <delt0r> Java is neither, and a master of none.
2012-06-27T11:18:53  <thestinger> well, C++ just has too much legacy stuff and backwards compatibility
2012-06-27T11:19:00  <thestinger> D is basically a clean break from that
2012-06-27T11:19:06  <thestinger> and Rust is a similar idea
2012-06-27T11:19:38  <mleise> Java is the master of OOP :)
2012-06-27T11:20:10  <mleise> the API is intuitive, methods got renamed if they could be misinterpreted
2012-06-27T11:20:10  <delt0r> Java is the master of group OOP... in that you don't break other peoples code when you be a dick
2012-06-27T11:20:27  <delt0r> C++, not so much
2012-06-27T11:21:36  <mleise> C++ has a comfortable position: there are compilers for it on every platform and OS
2012-06-27T11:21:42  <delt0r> well i like lisp... and either way... i often think there still must be a better way
2012-06-27T11:22:01  <mcstar> DONT
2012-06-27T11:22:03  <mleise> what does one like about forests of parenthesis?
2012-06-27T11:22:06  <mcstar> i just finished reading the logs
2012-06-27T11:22:54  <delt0r> mleise: yes and no... the standard libs are pathetic... its 2012 and i have to use different code to write/read sockets on differnt platforms with the same hardware!
2012-06-27T11:23:17  <thestinger> delt0r: for C++? there are a _lot_ of nice libs though
2012-06-27T11:23:25  <thestinger> libraries definitely isn't a weakness for C++
2012-06-27T11:23:30  <mleise> LISP
2012-06-27T11:23:33  <delt0r> mleise: syntax seen and unseen. Python its spaces, C/C++/Java its different brackets and ; and stuff
2012-06-27T11:23:51  <thestinger> delt0r: you could always use clojure though
2012-06-27T11:24:02  <delt0r> thestinger: yea but cross platform code is still a total bitch and by now it shouldn't be
2012-06-27T11:24:19  <delt0r> in any lang... the standard libs should be way better by now
2012-06-27T11:24:19  <mcstar> bleh, language wars
2012-06-27T11:24:29  <mcstar> (use clojure if you want a modern lisp)
2012-06-27T11:24:31  <delt0r> mcstar: where?
2012-06-27T11:24:33  <mleise> mcstar: not really
2012-06-27T11:24:43  <mcstar> keep telling that
2012-06-27T11:25:13  <mcstar> started with 'what will happen with the contest', but now its about 'i like this language more than that, but all suck'
2012-06-27T11:25:20  <delt0r> mcstar: well otherwise its rag on jeff
2012-06-27T11:25:48  <delt0r> mcstar: also good summary --its how i feel about programing langs
2012-06-27T11:26:06  <mleise> Yes, we discuss languages, but we don't trench ourselves in one language. :)
2012-06-27T11:26:10  <delt0r> so what do you think about breaking off a new comp mcstar
2012-06-27T11:26:18  <mcstar> yeah, but this sort of talk repeat itself, sort of boring to hear it from time to time again
2012-06-27T11:26:33  <mcstar> delt0r: great
2012-06-27T11:26:38  <delt0r> really?
2012-06-27T11:26:42  <mleise> mcstar: you need a break from computers that's all
2012-06-27T11:28:10  <mcstar> mleise: im studying math atm, little break from physics, stopped computer stuff weeks ago
2012-06-27T11:28:12  <delt0r> I was thinking if i can't get a hold of jeff/amstan etc next month then... well perhaps. Will try with getting the uni behind it
2012-06-27T11:28:25  <mleise> ok, I'm afk. Now starts the talk that *I* heard before ;)
2012-06-27T11:28:51  <mcstar> mleise: sry, im silent
2012-06-27T11:28:51  <delt0r> mleise: we all have... the jeff issue is a old one... like 3 years old
2012-06-27T11:29:35  <mleise> no, the "EU ai challenge" talk
2012-06-27T11:29:48  <mcstar> oh
2012-06-27T11:30:11  <mleise> just go ahead, I wanted to go running ... if it doesn't rain
2012-06-27T11:30:55  <mleise> damn weather these days, i hope the public vewing tomorrow will be better :D
2012-06-27T11:31:12  <delt0r> mleise: well you didn't say if you think its a good idea?
2012-06-27T11:31:36  <mleise> I didn't want to crush your idea.
2012-06-27T11:31:59  <mcstar> its soo annoying, where i run, the vegetation has grown quite a bit, and spiders tend to have their webs on the lower branches, usually im the one whose face collects the webs
2012-06-27T11:32:00  <mleise> It's nice, but I am a pessimist
2012-06-27T11:32:05  <delt0r> well i want to know what others are thinking... i know a lot of competitors just want a comp
2012-06-27T11:32:23  <mleise> and that could get things rolling
2012-06-27T11:32:41  <mleise> on the otherhand noone knows the new adress, it looks unofficial, no google etc...
2012-06-27T11:32:50  <mleise> sorry for my spelling
2012-06-27T11:33:27  <delt0r> oh, i would do something about that...start with a uni affiliation etc. get some sponsor on board...
2012-06-27T11:33:36  <mcstar> ok, first things first
2012-06-27T11:33:51  <delt0r> yea... try to get this one working first....
2012-06-27T11:34:00  <mleise> mcstar: I had a cellar spider (called Zitterspinne here) crawling right through the air over 5 meters
2012-06-27T11:34:17  <mcstar> the contest needs to identify itself, people have to be able to differentiate it from everything else, we need branding
2012-06-27T11:34:23  <mcstar> we need a name and a good logo
2012-06-27T11:34:36  <mcstar> probably should keep Ai Challenge
2012-06-27T11:34:40  <mleise> it hang from a door frame for a while and then disappeared in the room, like it just created a rope to the other wall
2012-06-27T11:34:50  <mcstar> since google had nothing to do with the contest except funding
2012-06-27T11:35:09  <mcstar> mleise: thats a HUGE spider
2012-06-27T11:35:25  <mleise> uh, a string then?
2012-06-27T11:35:29  <delt0r> Ideally we keep this one... its great... but its bloody frustrating as well
2012-06-27T11:35:30  <mcstar> 5m spider
2012-06-27T11:35:49  <mcstar> delt0r: we would really need a professional logo
2012-06-27T11:35:54  <delt0r> mcstar: in fact some years google gave no funding
2012-06-27T11:36:26  <delt0r> just permitted us to use the name... at least that was what i was told
2012-06-27T11:36:43  * mleise agrees
2012-06-27T11:37:08  <delt0r> mcstar: not sure if i buy that. what does professional mean in this context...because i don't think expensive gets the job done
2012-06-27T11:38:16  <mleise> At greenpeace we had some supporters that helped us out, like a photographer. maybe there is a graphics artist amongst us, like the one amstan knowns
2012-06-27T11:38:48  <mcstar> another thing, iirc this was mentioned when the Core last talked, that it might be possible to write a distributed engine, i thought about this some weeks before that, so the idea is that contestants would donate as much CPU power as they can, buy running the engine in a secure distributed environment, the only thing im not sure how to manage, is language diversity. this contest is great for being to use
2012-06-27T11:38:50  <mcstar> any language you like(within reason), and i dont want to see that taken away
2012-06-27T11:39:16  <mleise> mcstar: I fancied this idea for a while, too
2012-06-27T11:39:21  <mcstar> delt0r: something, that looks good enough, and wouldnt need changing
2012-06-27T11:39:50  <mcstar> i mean over time
2012-06-27T11:40:13  <mcstar> so as to establish the quality of the contest, and its independence
2012-06-27T11:40:41  <delt0r> yea... i really would want to keep language diversity and accessibility for very green coders
2012-06-27T11:41:52  <delt0r> as for the distribution part...quite a few contestants where alarmed that it would make cheating easier. But otherwise i think something could be make to work
2012-06-27T11:41:56  <mleise> The trouble is, that the clients need to run, say, PHP code from other people
2012-06-27T11:42:07  <delt0r> even if is something like a live boot DVD
2012-06-27T11:42:34  <delt0r> there would be some serious trust involved. either way
2012-06-27T11:42:41  <mleise> ok, rebooting your computer into a clean OS is a bad requirement ;)
2012-06-27T11:42:47  <delt0r> it is
2012-06-27T11:42:55  <mcstar> i dont mean anything like that
2012-06-27T11:42:56  <mleise> i thought more of a virtual machine in the host
2012-06-27T11:43:04  <delt0r> but i think the kind of "donation" we are talking about are spare machines
2012-06-27T11:43:07  <pairofdice> That's a bit heavy requirement
2012-06-27T11:43:16  <delt0r> ie i have 4 at home
2012-06-27T11:43:23  <mleise> delt0r: wut ?
2012-06-27T11:43:38  <delt0r> we are not talking about seti@home
2012-06-27T11:43:47  <mleise> ok, i have a spare 866 Mhz CPU
2012-06-27T11:43:47  <mcstar> you can run a self contained virtual machine on top of the os, the problem is having all the diferent runtimes on that virtual OS
2012-06-27T11:43:57  <delt0r> that just won't work without forcing language requirements
2012-06-27T11:44:10  <mcstar> delt0r: it could
2012-06-27T11:44:21  <delt0r> mcstar: and if its not configured exactly right then half the bots don't run
2012-06-27T11:44:29  <mcstar> but it would need a larger download on the part of the donatee
2012-06-27T11:44:34  <mcstar> ergh
2012-06-27T11:44:42  <mcstar> donor
2012-06-27T11:44:44  <delt0r> not to mention that configuring would be nightmare to do properly
2012-06-27T11:45:01  <mcstar> delt0r: you would need to configure it only once
2012-06-27T11:45:11  <mleise> what mcstar said
2012-06-27T11:45:12  <delt0r> most will be fairly new to even the idea of a virtual OS
2012-06-27T11:45:26  <mleise> otherwise you need to set it up on every donated computer
2012-06-27T11:45:27  <mcstar> they basically wouldnt need to touch a thing
2012-06-27T11:45:49  <mleise> one virtual machine is better than 20 language packs
2012-06-27T11:45:51  <delt0r> ?? what?
2012-06-27T11:46:16  <delt0r> yea and try and get 100 people to configure there machines to have the vos ?
2012-06-27T11:46:17  <mleise> ah i see a confusion
2012-06-27T11:46:34  <delt0r> nothing but 5 years of support emails
2012-06-27T11:46:43  <mcstar> mleise: try to sort this out then
2012-06-27T11:46:52  <mcstar> i dont see what deltor doesnt get
2012-06-27T11:47:03  <thestinger> delt0r: you don't need to configure anything
2012-06-27T11:47:09  <mleise> I see what I didn't get
2012-06-27T11:47:17  <thestinger> you install virtualbox and use the image that would be distributed
2012-06-27T11:47:20  <thestinger> no configuration needed
2012-06-27T11:47:21  <delt0r> mcstar: you think most people will be able to configure a virtual os...
2012-06-27T11:47:24  <thestinger> all the languages already there
2012-06-27T11:47:29  <delt0r> thestinger: why not...
2012-06-27T11:47:30  <thestinger> and you can have the same environment as the server will
2012-06-27T11:47:41  <mleise> donated PC vs. donated CPU time / VM vs. no VM
2012-06-27T11:47:51  <delt0r> how do you get a vos on these machines without the user configuring one
2012-06-27T11:48:04  <mleise> The live DVD for donated PCs seems the easiest solution
2012-06-27T11:48:09  <thestinger> delt0r: they just have to install it
2012-06-27T11:48:16  <thestinger> same as if they want to download a language pack
2012-06-27T11:48:30  <delt0r> have you done this before?
2012-06-27T11:48:57  <delt0r> because i don't belevie that for one second... given the issues even the offical servers had with some compatablity issues
2012-06-27T11:48:59  <mleise> I have never created a live DVD, no
2012-06-27T11:49:13  <thestinger> delt0r: what do you mean?
2012-06-27T11:49:18  <delt0r> mleise: its quite easy..
2012-06-27T11:49:50  <thestinger> delt0r: well, a live install could be an alternative to a VM
2012-06-27T11:49:51  <delt0r> thestinger: i mean there is no VOS that just downloads and installs and just works the same everywhere...
2012-06-27T11:49:57  <mcstar> delt0r: imagine, i make a virtual disk, maybe in several flavors for several VirtualMachines, this disk would have a small linux kernel, with all the runtimes of al the languages there are, not the donor downloads this, and fires up his favorite VM with the disk image, after that, he doenst need to do anything
2012-06-27T11:50:21  <mcstar> not -> then
2012-06-27T11:50:27  <mleise> ok, so we would offer a VM image + a live DVD
2012-06-27T11:50:28  <mcstar> not -> now
2012-06-27T11:50:36  <delt0r> mcstar: i think you underestimate how different a VM is from the real thing
2012-06-27T11:50:57  <delt0r> for example the memory issues with java...
2012-06-27T11:51:04  <thestinger> how is it different? just slower
2012-06-27T11:51:07  <mcstar> delt0r: i used virtualbox, qemu, qemu-kvm, vmware
2012-06-27T11:51:20  <thestinger> delt0r: it can be given any amount of memory
2012-06-27T11:51:35  <mcstar> and you just provide the config file
2012-06-27T11:51:45  <mcstar> te user imports the virtual environment and thats all
2012-06-27T11:51:48  <delt0r> shared memory and Vmemory is not handled well at lest by some --hell its handled wrong
2012-06-27T11:51:50  <mcstar> the
2012-06-27T11:52:11  <mcstar> im sorry, who cares/
2012-06-27T11:52:12  <delt0r> for example all the java issues for the last 2 comps...
2012-06-27T11:52:14  <mcstar> ?
2012-06-27T11:52:23  <mleise> delt0r: what was the VM on the server called? OpenVM?
2012-06-27T11:52:42  <mcstar> come on, java runs on cell phones from the 1980's at least
2012-06-27T11:53:30  <delt0r> I don't recall... but it borked some virtual memory stuff. For example the JVM uses memory mapped files... the true amount of ram used is really low, but not to the VM used
2012-06-27T11:53:34  <mleise> mcstar: it is Java for mobile devices that runs there ;)
2012-06-27T11:53:53  <delt0r> this is just an example
2012-06-27T11:53:55  <mcstar> yeah, im kidding the point is it isnt impossible
2012-06-27T11:54:31  <mleise> but the current implementations expect to get gigabytes of virtual memory
2012-06-27T11:54:33  <delt0r> so mapped files and other allocation tricks do trip up a lot of virtual solutions
2012-06-27T11:54:57  <mcstar> jvm just like sbcl can allocate more than physical ram
2012-06-27T11:55:02  <mcstar> but thats not a problem
2012-06-27T11:55:16  <mcstar> linux by default permit overallocation
2012-06-27T11:55:20  <thestinger> or C... everything uses vmem and memory mapped files
2012-06-27T11:55:33  <mcstar> IF the linux kernel is configure to not allow that, youre fucked
2012-06-27T11:55:35  <mleise> C programs usually behave ;)
2012-06-27T11:56:01  <mcstar> (excuse my typos, this new keyboard is killing me)
2012-06-27T11:56:20  <mleise> well, the point is that some virtual machines have problems with some virtual machines
2012-06-27T11:56:33  <delt0r> mcstar: it was a problem in the last comp... that is my point... its not all "just run that" otherwise there would have less issues last time around
2012-06-27T11:57:06  <mcstar> delt0r: were they in control of the OS?
2012-06-27T11:57:21  <mleise> it was a problem with the specific virtual machine used by the beta test servers
2012-06-27T11:57:27  <mleise> no control of the host os
2012-06-27T11:57:34  <mcstar> right
2012-06-27T11:57:36  <thestinger> EC2?
2012-06-27T11:57:41  <mleise> but we had 1 GB of ram
2012-06-27T11:57:45  <mleise> no EC2 iirc
2012-06-27T11:57:48  <mcstar> the one donated by demerzel?
2012-06-27T11:57:51  <mleise> maybe
2012-06-27T11:57:55  <mleise> i don't know
2012-06-27T11:57:58  <mcstar> i think it was that
2012-06-27T11:57:59  <delt0r> yea... but then you don't control the hardwere here either
2012-06-27T11:58:29  <mcstar> delt0r: the VM could have allocated 1GB real ram, while a program inside it 8GB
2012-06-27T11:58:30  <delt0r> Either way it could be done both ways
2012-06-27T11:58:35  <mleise> so Java allocates 1 GB of virtual memory and the virtual server went hay wire
2012-06-27T11:59:24  <mleise> we could blacklist virtual machines where virtual memory equals RAM
2012-06-27T11:59:28  <mcstar> and, take into account, that probably, there wouldnt be as many running instances of the bots on a donor PC than on a cloud instance
2012-06-27T11:59:40  <delt0r> well its not really virtual if it can't handle what is considered best practice for many applications (aka memory mapped files for example)
2012-06-27T11:59:49  <mleise> mcstar: one game with 8 bots = 8 GB RAM
2012-06-27T12:00:08  <delt0r> well i do have 16 gig here :D
2012-06-27T12:00:22  <mcstar> obviously, you cant allow 1GB real ram per bot
2012-06-27T12:00:22  <mleise> delt0r: are there VMs that don't support memory mapped files at all?
2012-06-27T12:00:38  <mcstar> and it isnt necessary anyway
2012-06-27T12:00:41  <mleise> mcstar: so you need to modify the Java start up parameters
2012-06-27T12:00:42  <delt0r> no... they just try to allocate real ram...
2012-06-27T12:00:54  <delt0r> so a 1TB mapped file... is not going to wokr
2012-06-27T12:00:56  <delt0r> work
2012-06-27T12:01:05  <mleise> ok, but who *does* that?
2012-06-27T12:01:11  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2012-06-27T12:01:28  <delt0r> well for this comp apparently the jvm..
2012-06-27T12:01:40  <mleise> i thought it was just virtual memory?
2012-06-27T12:01:51  <delt0r> but we do it here all the time.. for large files with random access its the standard way to be fast
2012-06-27T12:01:53  <mleise> are you sure it was a memory mapped file?
2012-06-27T12:01:53  <mcstar> im not sure how memory mapped files are relevant
2012-06-27T12:02:20  <mleise> delt0r: that's bad practise. allocate in windows of a few MB instead
2012-06-27T12:02:26  <delt0r> its the same thing... the number of pages, or VM is *not* the same as the amount of real RAM
2012-06-27T12:02:28  <mcstar> delt0r: its not like you need to visualize tons of gigabytes in bit
2012-06-27T12:02:29  <mleise> e.g. "move" the mapping
2012-06-27T12:02:30  <mcstar> s
2012-06-27T12:03:01  <delt0r> but for some reason (can't think of any good ones) some VM treat them as the same...
2012-06-27T12:03:24  <mleise> yes, let's black list those!
2012-06-27T12:03:37  <delt0r> I understood that VM allocation was largely for mapped files. But i could be wrong
2012-06-27T12:03:45  <mcstar> lets defer this conversation up until we face saomething like this IRL
2012-06-27T12:04:02  <delt0r> In Real Life
2012-06-27T12:04:05  <mleise> mcstar: we kinda did on the beta test server
2012-06-27T12:04:07  <delt0r> what that
2012-06-27T12:04:21  <mleise> it was a horrible experience
2012-06-27T12:04:24  <mcstar> mleise: im talking about this proof of concept virtual something
2012-06-27T12:04:36  <mcstar> if and when it comes up we discuss it
2012-06-27T12:04:41  <delt0r> well both options can be provided... bootable DVD image and a VM DVD image
2012-06-27T12:04:53  <mcstar> delt0r: not really
2012-06-27T12:05:04  <delt0r> why not?
2012-06-27T12:05:07  <mcstar> for a bootable thingy you need to support more hardware
2012-06-27T12:05:22  <mcstar> if you have a vm image you only need to support the common virtualized hardware
2012-06-27T12:05:40  <delt0r> that really is not hard...aka start with a standard linux boot
2012-06-27T12:06:14  <delt0r> what exotic hardware needs to be supported..?
2012-06-27T12:06:32  <mleise> LPT Zip drive hard disks
2012-06-27T12:06:39  <mcstar> yeah, so a 5.5GHz 12Core machine will eat 500Watts of power, because the live cd doesnt support frequency scaling
2012-06-27T12:06:59  <delt0r> mcstar: WTF... they all bloody do? its not 1995
2012-06-27T12:07:12  <mleise> hehe
2012-06-27T12:07:42  <delt0r> generic kernals do fine..and would support anything the VM gunna work on
2012-06-27T12:07:55  <mcstar> i know i wouldnt boot a PC just for that, but i'd run it on my OS
2012-06-27T12:08:26  <delt0r> I think there are few like me that could put hardware online for quite long periods of time
2012-06-27T12:08:55  <mleise> It is kinda nice to have the main computer free.
2012-06-27T12:08:57  <mcstar> delt0r: so are you going to tell me, you gonna boot up a cluster from a live cd i provided?
2012-06-27T12:09:00  <mcstar> noway in hell
2012-06-27T12:09:07  <delt0r> i mean an extra 3-4 4 core machines would have gone a long way last time
2012-06-27T12:09:28  <delt0r> mcstar: i am going to check that dvd first... but sure, why not?
2012-06-27T12:09:42  <delt0r> I download linux images and boot them on that
2012-06-27T12:09:57  <mcstar> i dont intend to provide infiniband drivers..
2012-06-27T12:10:10  <delt0r> why would you need to
2012-06-27T12:10:16  <mleise> The competition files should be downloaded from the web though, in case we need to update something
2012-06-27T12:10:24  <delt0r> yes...
2012-06-27T12:10:25  <mcstar> delt0r: partly joking
2012-06-27T12:10:28  <delt0r> oh
2012-06-27T12:10:30  <delt0r> missed it
2012-06-27T12:10:31  <delt0r> hehe
2012-06-27T12:10:36  <delt0r> :P
2012-06-27T12:10:45  <mcstar> but commodity clusters use infiniband, at least around here
2012-06-27T12:11:27  <mcstar> (probably they work just fine with some common driver in 100th of the nominal throughput)
2012-06-27T12:11:53  <delt0r> just to be clear--these are just machines i am running at home...
2012-06-27T12:12:09  <mcstar> anyway, should we consider this distributed game engine notion seriously?
2012-06-27T12:12:23  <delt0r> if a real cluster would be put to use i would assume the cluster admins would deal with everything
2012-06-27T12:12:31  <delt0r> mcstar: yes... i suggested so...
2012-06-27T12:12:58  <delt0r> even with the cheating "issues" it can work in the run up phase where the ranking are not offical
2012-06-27T12:13:07  <mleise> yes, but only if no servers can be bought
2012-06-27T12:13:11  <delt0r> this is where most complain about the lack of game rate
2012-06-27T12:13:23  <mleise> someone still has to convince some poeple that their source code would be on other peoples computers
2012-06-27T12:13:34  <mcstar> only binary
2012-06-27T12:13:40  <mleise> lol ;)
2012-06-27T12:13:42  <delt0r> since the offical rank is offline... and extra few days is no biggie
2012-06-27T12:13:43  <mcstar> and it would be secure
2012-06-27T12:13:48  <mleise> binary PHP?
2012-06-27T12:13:48  <mcstar> in principle
2012-06-27T12:13:57  <mcstar> mleise: you got me there
2012-06-27T12:14:05  <mcstar> is that a computer language?
2012-06-27T12:14:13  <mcstar> :)
2012-06-27T12:14:20  <mleise> i whish it wasn't
2012-06-27T12:14:30  <mcstar> i forgot for a moment that not everything compiles to native code
2012-06-27T12:14:30  <mleise> it is the worst, second to brainfuck
2012-06-27T12:15:05  <delt0r> well i always though that we could just submit binary. Why do we need to submit source anyway?
2012-06-27T12:15:35  <mleise> hmm, the binaries would have to be distributed as Intel 586 Linux 32-bit?
2012-06-27T12:16:18  <mleise> delt0r: we need the source to determine the source language for the statistics overview
2012-06-27T12:16:42  <delt0r> well i would expect the servers to be multilib --both 64bit and 32bit.
2012-06-27T12:16:55  <mleise> and because windows binaries have a hard time running on linux
2012-06-27T12:16:55  <mcstar> what??
2012-06-27T12:16:56  <mcstar> nono
2012-06-27T12:17:04  <delt0r> mleise: right...there is always the "can get caught with evil code" too
2012-06-27T12:17:04  <mcstar> the user would upload the code to the site
2012-06-27T12:17:20  <mcstar> and 1 server would distribute the binary in a secure way among the donor pcs
2012-06-27T12:17:30  <mcstar> or the source...
2012-06-27T12:17:32  <delt0r> well windows source files had a hard time compiling too :D
2012-06-27T12:18:06  <delt0r> mcstar: use public keys. etc. something like github... bit of work however
2012-06-27T12:18:07  <mcstar> the code would run in a kernel sandbox
2012-06-27T12:18:24  <mcstar> im only in this, if it could be made secure
2012-06-27T12:18:29  <mcstar> as in secure
2012-06-27T12:18:40  <mcstar> not hand-wavin security
2012-06-27T12:18:44  <delt0r> mcstar: of course...
2012-06-27T12:18:46  <mleise> mcstar: as in "noone can read my PHP code"?
2012-06-27T12:18:52  <mcstar> yes
2012-06-27T12:19:00  <delt0r> but real security is only true when your machine is turned off...
2012-06-27T12:19:00  <mleise> :(
2012-06-27T12:19:27  <mcstar> delt0r: you can provide real life security against tampering and evasdropping
2012-06-27T12:20:05  <delt0r> well this is where the cheating arguments came from... players would run servers to cheat by looking at source or decompiling or whatever
2012-06-27T12:20:09  <mleise> mcstar: anyone can modify the live DVD to send a copy of the incoming bot code to some email address
2012-06-27T12:20:13  <mcstar> ofc, if someone decides to debug the VM's instructions and reverse engineer the stuff...
2012-06-27T12:20:37  <delt0r> mcstar: like i said... just turn your computer off... BEFORE you write any code :D
2012-06-27T12:21:24  <delt0r> there is a trust case... or only non combatants can donate server time... Still hard to do.
2012-06-27T12:22:02  <mcstar> im sure something could be worked out, that would work in real life situations(assuming not computer geniuses with a 180 IQ attack the engine)
2012-06-27T12:22:21  <mleise> that counts me out :/
2012-06-27T12:22:58  <delt0r> having some way that some offical person/company can provide offical servers would be nice... but we are probably ahead of ourselfs...
2012-06-27T12:23:16  <delt0r> better to just get a cluster....
2012-06-27T12:23:18  <delt0r> :D
2012-06-27T12:23:28  <mcstar> not necessairly, it must be clear from the start where would we want to run the engine
2012-06-27T12:24:06  <delt0r> if servers are not something the general public provide, where is the problem?
2012-06-27T12:24:18  <delt0r> read general public== people who enter
2012-06-27T12:24:35  <mcstar> delt0r: maybe we should opt for some EU fund: 'Teaching programming hands-on'
2012-06-27T12:24:58  <delt0r> yea... they are pretty good with that sort of stuff
2012-06-27T12:25:01  <mleise> right, the EU likes to spend billions on hopeless cases ;)
2012-06-27T12:25:15  <delt0r> well i wouldn't ask for billions the first time...
2012-06-27T12:25:28  <mcstar> couple thousand would do
2012-06-27T12:25:31  <delt0r> but i may ask to borrow billons
2012-06-27T12:25:55  <mleise> sure all the billions are "borrowed"
2012-06-27T12:26:08  <mleise> ha!
2012-06-27T12:26:10  <mcstar> well, all the money is borrowed
2012-06-27T12:26:28  <mcstar> private banks loan money for governments

2012-06-27T12:26:34  <delt0r> its a known fact that if you live in a nice sunny climate... you don't need to pay it back
2012-06-27T12:27:35  <mleise> mcstar just made me wonder
2012-06-27T12:27:44  <mleise> I have to think this trhough
2012-06-27T12:29:46  <antimatroid> so much chatter
2012-06-27T12:29:53  <mcstar> i dont cheat!
2012-06-27T12:29:55  <delt0r> antimatroid: long time no chant
2012-06-27T12:29:58  <delt0r> chat
2012-06-27T12:30:04  <mcstar> oh, chat
2012-06-27T12:30:16  <delt0r> typos are my middle name
2012-06-27T12:30:17  <mcstar> i hate when people accuse me of cheating
2012-06-27T12:30:19  <antimatroid> delt0r delt0r delt0r delt0r|!!!
2012-06-27T12:30:22  <antimatroid> there we go :)
2012-06-27T12:33:06  <delt0r> antimatroid: so did you hear anything about what is happening
2012-06-27T12:33:15  <antimatroid> nope?
2012-06-27T12:33:23  <delt0r> just checking
2012-06-27T12:33:41  <antimatroid> phew, secret kept
2012-06-27T12:33:46  <antimatroid> :\ :P
2012-06-27T12:34:43  <mcstar> antimatroid: we know you overheard the whole conversation
2012-06-27T12:34:50  <antimatroid> oh from in here?
2012-06-27T12:34:52  <mcstar> we know there is nowhere you can hide
2012-06-27T12:34:52  <antimatroid> i haven't read up
2012-06-27T12:34:58  <mcstar> we come and get you
2012-06-27T12:35:52  <mcstar> antimatroid: btw, it is a really realy bad idea, to read-up, from the bottom
2012-06-27T12:36:04  <mcstar> just scroll up, and read from the beginning
2012-06-27T12:36:14  <mcstar> my 2 cents
2012-06-27T12:36:48  <mleise> yeah, it is not like there is any unrelated chat from the past days here ;)
2012-06-27T12:39:00  <antimatroid> yeah, i have started reading
2012-06-27T12:39:03  <antimatroid> although i should be marking :P
2012-06-27T12:39:16  <delt0r> antimatroid: the question i have (yes it is above), what do you think of a separate new comp
2012-06-27T12:42:17  <antimatroid> delt0r: i don't think we'll get the same support without "Google"
2012-06-27T12:42:23  <delt0r> yea
2012-06-27T12:42:34  <antimatroid> there are people who at least visit here with Google affiliation though
2012-06-27T12:42:37  <antimatroid> which aren't jeff
2012-06-27T12:42:58  <antimatroid> i think we'd be better off telling jeff to htfu or pass on responsibilities
2012-06-27T12:42:58  <delt0r> but right now we are having a hard time even saying when we will have the next comp
2012-06-27T12:43:21  <antimatroid> i like the project euler type aim too
2012-06-27T12:43:28  <mcstar> ?
2012-06-27T12:43:29  <antimatroid> have old contests up that people can continue working on
2012-06-27T12:43:32  <mcstar> which is what?
2012-06-27T12:43:34  <antimatroid> i suspect with just tcp servers
2012-06-27T12:43:53  <antimatroid> i want that more than new contests
2012-06-27T12:43:58  <antimatroid> i want tron :P
2012-06-27T12:44:14  <mcstar> but you can do that already, cant you?
2012-06-27T12:44:15  <delt0r> I did like watching tron games...
2012-06-27T12:44:19  <mcstar> play offline against the top bots?
2012-06-27T12:44:42  <delt0r> and i dont really like games that degenerate into min/max trees
2012-06-27T12:44:58  <antimatroid> i want to play against people online
2012-06-27T12:45:25  <mcstar> hm
2012-06-27T12:45:25  <delt0r> I think human playable is nice
2012-06-27T12:45:26  <antimatroid> delt0r: those tron bots were awesome to watch and i want to play with a proper min/max tree again
2012-06-27T12:45:31  <antimatroid> i've only ever done it with tron
2012-06-27T12:45:46  <delt0r> i found it boring
2012-06-27T12:45:47  <antimatroid> while my other bots used a horrible bastardisation of min/max, tron really lets you explore the game tree
2012-06-27T12:46:00  <antimatroid> i want to see what works best for pruning etc.
2012-06-27T12:46:06  <antimatroid> i want to try out a bunch of different things
2012-06-27T12:47:31  <mcstar> running past contests is secondary
2012-06-27T12:47:44  <mcstar> challange==new problem==rush of adrenaline
2012-06-27T12:47:51  <antimatroid> i disagree to some degree
2012-06-27T12:48:02  <mcstar> the contestant has to believe he can be the one to one
2012-06-27T12:48:10  <mcstar> to win *
2012-06-27T12:48:13  <antimatroid> if past contests have people actively working with them we have a larger pool of volunteers to get other shit done with
2012-06-27T12:48:59  <antimatroid> all i want is a nice official tcp server
2012-06-27T12:49:08  <antimatroid> smiley1983 was working on a tcp server for a bit
2012-06-27T12:50:06  <delt0r> that is really just the framework problem
2012-06-27T12:50:24  <delt0r> I was/will work on that once the jeff thing is sorted
2012-06-27T12:56:29  <mcstar> lol, captain archer sliced the antenna off of the head of the andorian commander in the duel
