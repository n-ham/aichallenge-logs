2010-09-17T00:00:08  <Cyndre> its like, this state pleases me
2010-09-17T00:00:27  <odinsbane> amstan: so I can have my bot scrape html pages when its running on the ai-contest server?
2010-09-17T00:00:35  <amstan> odinsbane: no
2010-09-17T00:00:40  <Cyndre> amstan: I take the shell access back, but leave the db there
2010-09-17T00:00:56  <Cyndre> amstan: cpanels just a cheap solution
2010-09-17T00:00:59  <amstan> odinsbane: you have to make a system to change the bot, upload it, let it cook, then download results
2010-09-17T00:01:09  <amstan> Cyndre: huh?
2010-09-17T00:01:11  <Cyndre> amstan: probably an open source one for splitting up mysql dbs though
2010-09-17T00:01:19  <odinsbane> For that tcp should work, anyway see y'll around
2010-09-17T00:01:24  <amstan> Cyndre: so like... you're free to try it
2010-09-17T00:01:33  <amstan> Cyndre: ideas are cheap, implementing them is hard

2010-09-17T00:39:36  <naglijo> hi, can i do webservice calls? what is the max file size of what i can submit?
2010-09-17T00:40:39  <Janzert> Baphomet: are you sure one of the bots isn't crashing after turn 1?
2010-09-17T00:40:43  <Baphomet> very sure
2010-09-17T00:40:53  <Baphomet> it works perfectly with the normal visuliser

2010-09-17T00:41:15  <Baphomet> and they both work on the offical server and on tcp svr

2010-09-17T00:41:38  <Baphomet> and the game does actually finish
2010-09-17T00:41:59  <Baphomet> also its not always after turn 1
2010-09-17T00:42:10  <Baphomet> but it always happens before the game ends
2010-09-17T00:42:51  <naglijo> you cant write to files but you can read, correct?
2010-09-17T00:42:53  <Janzert> sorry, no other idea then
2010-09-17T00:43:00  <Janzert> naglijo: yes
2010-09-17T00:43:15  <naglijo> is there a max file size of your submission?
2010-09-17T00:43:48  <Janzert> I heard a 10MB rumor but I don't really know
2010-09-17T00:44:00  <Baphomet> Your zip file may not exceed 2 MB in size. If you need to submit a bigger file for some reason, that's fine. Post on the forums and we'll work something out.
2010-09-17T00:44:11  <pjreddie> odinsbane & rogue780: I use TCP but i time out or dc all the time. and no i use a mac.
2010-09-17T00:44:12  <naglijo> are the rules for what is considered a security violation made public?
2010-09-17T00:44:25  <Baphomet> yea
2010-09-17T00:44:28  <rogue780> silly macs
2010-09-17T00:44:33  <Baphomet> stop tryign to hack and cheat lol
2010-09-17T00:44:47  <naglijo> not cheating, want to know the full rules
2010-09-17T00:44:53  <Baphomet> http://ai-contest.com/rules.php
2010-09-17T00:45:00  <Baphomet> probbly should take a read?
2010-09-17T00:45:03  <naglijo> ive only been shown the spec
2010-09-17T00:45:06  <Baphomet> everything is on there
2010-09-17T00:45:21  <Janzert> Rule: don't do anything malicious :)
2010-09-17T00:46:06  <pjreddie> tcp is ok but you can't repeat trials and debug stuff easily.
2010-09-17T00:46:10  <Baphomet> you could actually do a LOT of damage if you wanted to
2010-09-17T00:46:19  <Baphomet> considering the code is being executed locally
2010-09-17T00:46:20  <naglijo> ive seen that, im wondering about this point in the endgame conditions: #
2010-09-17T00:46:20  <naglijo> # A bot attempts to do something that the tournament manager deems a security issue and is disqualified.
2010-09-17T00:46:53  <Baphomet> lil' bita buffer overflow here and there, some shell code injections and your all set ;)
2010-09-17T00:47:27  <Janzert> It is at least run sandboxed under a VM so it should take a *bit* of work to do real damage :/
2010-09-17T00:48:10  <naglijo> im not looking to do damage or subvert the tournament
2010-09-17T00:48:14  <Baphomet> i remember once someone made an exploit to vmware server where you could take control over all of the other vms on the same box
2010-09-17T00:48:46  <Janzert> yeah, I'm sure it's possible to break out
2010-09-17T00:49:12  <naglijo> you can spawn child processes, correct?
2010-09-17T00:49:17  <Queue29> no
2010-09-17T00:49:28  <naglijo> but your bot can be in java?
2010-09-17T00:49:29  <Janzert> no forking or threading
2010-09-17T00:49:33  <naglijo> oh..

2010-09-17T01:16:56  <naglijo> bots on the tcp server do not have the conform to the same rules as the offical challenge, no?

2010-09-17T01:20:03  <naglijo> your bot runs locally so you do not have to conform to the rules of no network calls, file writes, or bot size
2010-09-17T01:20:09  <naglijo> etc
2010-09-17T01:20:13  <rwa> correct
2010-09-17T01:20:33  <rwa> that's one of the points of it, I think, is so that you can log/debug, etc.
2010-09-17T01:22:07  <naglijo> the engine used is different than in the official challenge tho, correct?
2010-09-17T01:22:35  <rwa> technically yes but I think it is designed to have the same rules
2010-09-17T01:22:56  <rwa> certainly bots doing well on the tcp server are also doing well on the main server

2010-09-17T01:35:37  <rwa> antimatroid1: whoa, dropping cs major maybe not a winning strategy
2010-09-17T01:35:39  <antimatroid1> i have done data storage and simple heuristics, this weekend i'm trying to actually implement something decent

2010-09-17T01:51:38  <rwa> I need dmj and deepblue to get on here to see if my latest bot has the right stuff
2010-09-17T01:51:59  <camedee> Can your bot make web service calls?
2010-09-17T01:53:21  <rwa> my bot plays tetris
2010-09-17T01:53:29  <rwa> kidding.  why?
2010-09-17T01:54:07  <camedee> I just wish there was a way to record how the matches went.
2010-09-17T01:54:14  <rwa> on the main server?
2010-09-17T01:54:23  <camedee> yup
2010-09-17T01:54:38  <rwa> I say just play on the tcp server, it's SO much faster and more productive
2010-09-17T01:54:49  <rwa> and you can log the heck out of it if you want
2010-09-17T01:56:02  <camedee> Sounds like a plan.
2010-09-17T01:57:00  <camedee> Thanks

2010-09-17T02:13:27  <rwa> is that a bot parameter you're encoding in the name?
2010-09-17T02:13:31  <rwa> or just a version #
2010-09-17T02:14:18  <whiteside> just some simple increments with the numbers, and "general idea" in the colors
2010-09-17T02:15:44  <whiteside> I'm still in the 8-color crayonbox in practice, but I've been writing down enough junk to get well into mauve-saffron-chartreuse-coquelicot territory eventually
2010-09-17T02:17:19  <rwa> I'm still on my first general idea
2010-09-17T02:17:32  <rwa> mostly because I only really have one general idea...lol
2010-09-17T02:18:13  <whiteside> hey, it obviously works
2010-09-17T02:18:32  <rwa> so far so good
2010-09-17T02:19:10  <whiteside> you're the one unleashing all those vortices right?
2010-09-17T02:19:14  <rwa> yes
2010-09-17T02:19:33  <rwa> oh, .5 just took a hit
2010-09-17T02:21:19  <whiteside> ahh yes... I made a comment the other day when you fired your bot up again, something about my ranking swirling down the crapper
2010-09-17T02:21:30  <whiteside> not that that's what you meant by "vortex" but the imagery certainly stuck with me
2010-09-17T02:22:13  <rwa> I was thinking more swirling tornado, but yea
2010-09-17T02:22:51  <rwa> pjreddie seems to either timeout or win
2010-09-17T02:23:03  <rwa> unfortunately for his ranking he times out 80% of the time

2010-09-17T02:26:25  <whiteside> oh ouch, I see what you mean with pjreddie
2010-09-17T02:26:39  <rwa> yeah, he's the only non-vortex bot which has beat vortex.5
2010-09-17T02:27:27  * whiteside makes a mental note to "offer him free hosting on my personal machine" just because he's such a swell guy/gal

2010-09-17T02:31:47  <whiteside> you see Cyndre, once your bot ceases worrying excessively and nitpicking about every single little thing in its life, the stress and self-defeating ideas leave, and it is truly free to do its best
2010-09-17T02:32:23  <Cyndre> 98 out of 100 on dual bot but 94/100 on rage bot

2010-09-17T02:42:20  <whiteside> what? you guys stopped at some point, and then continued to stop doing coding for a significant length of time afterwards?
2010-09-17T02:42:43  <whiteside> the thought is... terrifying...
2010-09-17T02:42:56  <Cyndre> work, daily
2010-09-17T02:43:17  <whiteside> :)
2010-09-17T02:43:28  <whiteside> the main reason I want to do respectably
2010-09-17T02:43:32  <rwa> yes, I went to work and sat there with graph paper for 8 hours working out strategies before going home to code some more ;)
2010-09-17T02:44:41  <whiteside> so that next year, I'm too busy with a job to spend all of my time trying to do well enough on it that I don't have to spend all my time doing well on it so that I don't have to spend all my time doing well on it so that I don't have to spend all of my time doing...

2010-09-17T02:48:11  <atmz443> yeah, guys, if you have time try to make sure your bots finish people off when they're winning, it'll save time for you and everyone you crush :)
2010-09-17T02:48:12  <rwa> Cyndre:  playing defense, eh?
2010-09-17T02:48:28  <atmz443> (in this case I assume your bot was supossed to do that)
2010-09-17T02:48:51  <Cyndre> rwa: well my evaulation code on whose winning excludes fleets in air so I removed it
2010-09-17T02:49:54  <atmz443> rwa: I had a fun bot going earlier which only defended and snatched planets that had *just* been taken by the enemy; it wasn't very good, but very amusing when it won
2010-09-17T02:50:07  <whiteside> Cyndre: ooh, that would be entirely fatal against my bot... it keeps most of its ships in flight intentionally
2010-09-17T02:50:11  <Cyndre> rwa: and other then a few tricks I want to try (scan censored for censored to figure out blackout within cut out of paper
2010-09-17T02:50:34  <whiteside> Cyndre: hahahaha
2010-09-17T02:50:56  <Cyndre> whiteside: well only the part that decides if it should switch to attack mode
2010-09-17T02:51:05  <Cyndre> ty
2010-09-17T02:51:06  <whiteside> (the hahaha was regarding the "declassified" documents)
2010-09-17T02:51:39  <rwa> ships in flight can't be attacked... but they also can't be directed to attack or defend

2010-09-17T02:55:08  <antimatroid1> i still have a lot of work to do before my current idea is all implemented
2010-09-17T02:55:40  <atmz443> hmmm maybe I should check to make sure I own planets I send fleets from
2010-09-17T02:55:56  <antimatroid1> atmz443: and that you have enough ships there to send ;)
2010-09-17T02:56:14  <antimatroid1> it takes pretty much no time, and ensures you don't lose a game like that
2010-09-17T02:56:51  <antimatroid1> hence why people say update a planets ship count as you send fleets off each turn
2010-09-17T02:56:55  <atmz443> (I changed my defense code to use pre-calculated nearest-neighbor lists instead of randomly picking planets to defend from)
2010-09-17T02:57:10  <atmz443> (and precalculated lists obviously dont include just my planets)
2010-09-17T02:57:17  <Cyndre> lmao
2010-09-17T02:57:20  <atmz443> (fixed now, but i lost 5 games to invalid input :p)
2010-09-17T02:58:23  <Cyndre> the first 9 bots are really only 2 different ones
2010-09-17T02:58:23  <antimatroid1> i have a terrible habbit of getting near something new, chopping it together till it works, then spending the next 2-3 days cleaning wtf i did up
2010-09-17T02:58:31  <Cyndre> well different versions of those 2
2010-09-17T02:59:08  <whiteside> it's at times hilarious to have little imaginary moments where you pretend the little ships are in an actual war, with some dudes flying around... "Go defend that planet." "B-but.. sir! It's the enemy's stronghold now! It hasn't been our planet si--" "I SAID GO"
2010-09-17T02:59:12  <antimatroid1> the mess i had after rewriting planet wars was horrible to sort through aha
2010-09-17T03:00:00  <Cyndre> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=13501  why would it stop and let the enemy catch up
2010-09-17T03:00:06  <boegel> I'm only winning games when the other bot crashes, that's no good, is it?
2010-09-17T03:00:39  <Cyndre> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=13478
2010-09-17T03:01:10  <boegel> Cyndre: collecting ships?
2010-09-17T03:01:34  <Cyndre> boegel: no - its supposed to just expand
2010-09-17T03:01:37  <Cyndre> its very simple
2010-09-17T03:01:56  <whiteside> you'd be surprised how much sadism a bot can implement with technologies these days
2010-09-17T03:02:13  <Cyndre> and my only loss's should have been wins
2010-09-17T03:02:15  <boegel> Cyndre: well, it's not, for some reason :P
2010-09-17T03:02:41  <Cyndre> and turn 6 it does it as well
2010-09-17T03:03:33  <atmz443> how do you guys figure out why you won/lost? I see stuff happening but mostly its a very fine line between winning and losing and I'm not sure what i'm doing right/wrong
2010-09-17T03:03:40  <atmz443> e.g. i have no idea why i won http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=13488
2010-09-17T03:03:53  <Cyndre> those ones were pretty obvious
2010-09-17T03:04:38  <Cyndre> dont use the way points for moving ships around
2010-09-17T03:05:31  <Cyndre> the enemy gains ground while you have the majority of your fleet in flight
2010-09-17T03:06:05  <Cyndre> at turn 61 the game changes hands
2010-09-17T03:06:56  <Cyndre> ie turn 66, 586 ships, 162 on planets and 424 in aitr
2010-09-17T03:06:59  <Cyndre> er air
2010-09-17T03:07:35  <boegel> atmz443: the enemy seems to be more interest in enforcing it's own planets
2010-09-17T03:08:00  <boegel> atmz443: you could be more aggressive at the end though, it takes you a while before you're actually winning

2010-09-17T03:24:38  <rwa> yes
2010-09-17T03:24:42  <antimatroid1> and did you rewrite planetwars?

2010-09-17T03:25:05  <rwa> is there reason to?  I haven't really looked in there yet
2010-09-17T03:25:07  <antimatroid1> i'm generating expected states for each planet for max distance in each turn
2010-09-17T03:25:43  <antimatroid1> i found it horrible, rewrote it to update stuff as it passed the game state and use just one pw variable in MyBot for the whole game
2010-09-17T03:25:54  <antimatroid1> everything became public too

2010-09-17T03:34:39  <atmz443> i had problems (with java) when it wasn't named the same as the starter pack zip
2010-09-17T03:35:05  <antimatroid1> yeah, yelled at me for changing MyBot.cc to Bot.cc
2010-09-17T03:35:34  <rwa> justin_pdx:  I don't think so, mine is named after my bot's name.  But I did have a problem with some files being accidentally included, that persisted after multiple submissions even though I removed them from the zipfile.
2010-09-17T03:36:04  <rwa> it's like it was unzipping to an existing directory and leaving stuff that was already there
2010-09-17T03:36:32  <sigh> rwa: wow that sucks, have they fixed that?
2010-09-17T03:36:53  <rwa> sigh: dunno, I haven't repeated the mistake.
2010-09-17T03:37:30  <justin_pdx> I named my directory "MyBot" and the zip was "MyBot.zip" and it worked.

2010-09-17T03:55:07  <justin_pdx> How do I use my bot with the tcp program?  It's in ruby.  Does it have to be in C?
2010-09-17T03:55:51  <rwa> shouldn't matter
2010-09-17T03:56:04  <rwa> as long as you can run the bot from the cmd line
2010-09-17T03:57:21  <rwa> you have to compile tcp.c tho
2010-09-17T03:57:24  <rwa> then
2010-09-17T03:57:51  <rwa> ./tcp 213.3.30.106 9999 botname ./botprog
2010-09-17T03:57:58  <rwa> you on a windows box or linux box?
2010-09-17T03:59:59  <justin_pdx> I got it working.  I had to put #!/usr/bin/ruby at the top of my file.

2010-09-17T04:25:44  <ratatata> I wonder if it's a connection thing

2010-09-17T04:25:52  <rwa> I think so, I'm suddenly having the same problem
2010-09-17T04:26:00  <Naktibalda> looks like server has some issues
2010-09-17T04:26:43  <rwa> who is tcp server writer guy?

2010-09-17T04:28:39  <rwa> right now it seems to hang and I hit ^C to get out
2010-09-17T04:28:50  <rwa> maybe there's another way?

2010-09-17T07:13:43  <speedway> And against other people?
2010-09-17T07:14:03  <Naktibalda> find a link to Galcon in contest site
2010-09-17T07:14:10  <delt0r_> speedway: Why would you want to?
2010-09-17T07:14:25  <delt0r_> our bots don't play like people do
2010-09-17T07:14:33  <speedway> Is it exactly the same game?
2010-09-17T07:14:37  <delt0r_> no
2010-09-17T07:14:48  <Naktibalda> game mechanics are  the same

2010-09-17T07:15:18  <delt0r_> But then galcon has a lot of variants too
2010-09-17T07:15:28  <speedway> I believe learning to play can help me write a better cot
2010-09-17T07:15:34  <Naktibalda> do you want to buy one for your iphone? :)
2010-09-17T07:15:37  <speedway> Bot
2010-09-17T07:15:51  <Naktibalda> I played it for learning too
2010-09-17T07:16:00  <danielvf> Me too
2010-09-17T07:16:03  <delt0r_> speedway: at any rate i do have a player that would let you play agaist local bots
2010-09-17T07:16:26  <HakanD> Playing for learning is a good idea
2010-09-17T07:16:32  <speedway> Is it available anywhere?
2010-09-17T07:16:38  <delt0r_> I am working on it now
2010-09-17T07:16:48  <HakanD> Yep
2010-09-17T07:16:51  <HakanD> On galcon site
2010-09-17T07:16:57  <speedway> Very nice, thanks
2010-09-17T07:17:01  <HakanD> Real time version
2010-09-17T07:17:19  <HakanD> Not the same, but still geliÅ
2010-09-17T07:17:24  <delt0r_> I permit "turn finished" and "real time" where you set a timer.
2010-09-17T07:17:26  <HakanD> Helps*
2010-09-17T07:17:37  <delt0r_> Its for debug more than anything else
2010-09-17T07:19:01  <HakanD> delt0r_: Will it be ready on weekend?
2010-09-17T07:19:10  <delt0r_> thats the plan
2010-09-17T07:19:19  <delt0r_> just doing a refactor now
2010-09-17T07:19:29  <HakanD> Hope so (:
2010-09-17T07:19:32  <speedway> If I can learn to beat my bot I can probably learn to improve it
2010-09-17T07:20:08  <delt0r_> speedway: It will be hard without the "turn finished " button.. ie the human gets as long as needed
2010-09-17T07:20:10  <Naktibalda> what if you fail? :)
2010-09-17T07:21:13  <Naktibalda> I think that it would be a good idea to run another instance of bot as target advisor
2010-09-17T07:21:38  <Naktibalda> hmm, it's stupid
2010-09-17T07:21:56  <Naktibalda> err, no

2010-09-17T09:00:26  <dhartmei_> it's just a buggy bot reconnecing immediately again
2010-09-17T09:00:35  <dhartmei_> not a problem for the server, but annoying for the other users
2010-09-17T09:01:00  <dhartmei_> he gets paired with himnself most of the time, but sometimes with stronger users (if nobody else is available in that second)
2010-09-17T09:01:23  <dhartmei_> maybe a genetic algorithm learning the very basics still? :)
2010-09-17T09:02:15  <amstan> dhartmei_: probably
2010-09-17T09:02:36  <amstan> dhartmei_: perhaps you should make your tcp client be multithreaded
2010-09-17T09:02:41  <amstan> so it can run more bots at once
2010-09-17T09:04:52  <dhartmei_> several people are running multiple instances concurrently, that's fine, it increases the games-played-per-minute rate, server and bandwidth are still ok. but it's annoying to die on first turn 1000 times :)

2010-09-17T10:20:35  <mega1> now that we are all [remote] friends, how come f# is there before CL?!
2010-09-17T10:21:11  <aerique> mega1: probably because there was already C# support
2010-09-17T10:21:47  <mega1> nay, I suspect personal biases and conspiracy.
2010-09-17T10:21:49  <Naktibalda> where do you see that it was added?

2010-09-17T10:30:57  <mega1> I take back my ill advised outburst on F# vs CL ... for now.
2010-09-17T10:31:22  <aerique> mega1: since they're not using make-clisp we should figure out the best commandline for compiling MyBot.lisp (like f.e. Haskell, C and Go in compile_anything.py)
2010-09-17T10:31:26  <Naktibalda> I think that they may have an incompatible version of Mono
2010-09-17T10:31:52  <aerique> mega1: or a script they can call
2010-09-17T10:32:04  <mega1> aerique: I guess the most flexible would be to run 'make'
2010-09-17T10:32:08  <mega1> or a script.
2010-09-17T10:32:27  <aerique> mega1: i don't think they want Makefiles in bot submissions
2010-09-17T10:32:42  <mega1> How is a script better?
2010-09-17T10:33:04  <aerique> mega1: they can check that and need to install it only once, all bots will use it
2010-09-17T10:33:49  <mega1> aerique: I'll strive to make that script almost empty.
2010-09-17T10:34:15  <mega1> as in "./bin/run-sbcl.sh --load compile-for-server.lisp"
2010-09-17T10:34:56  <mega1> There is nothing to be gained here by not using make.
2010-09-17T10:35:14  <mega1> Or is there?
2010-09-17T10:35:44  <aerique> mega1: perhaps we should continue on the forums, i have to do some more work before heading home :)
2010-09-17T10:36:11  <mega1> that's fine, I'll try to keep an eye on the forum

2010-09-17T10:53:41  <bartwe_> geee, thanks
2010-09-17T10:54:34  <bartwe_> it tends to make moves even it thinks has a negative expected value
2010-09-17T10:54:48  <bartwe_> bad cost prediciton
2010-09-17T10:54:48  <Naktibalda> this map is a deadlock
2010-09-17T10:55:23  <Naktibalda> you need 21 ships to capture a corner planet, but if you send out that much, you lose a home planet
2010-09-17T10:55:44  <sigh> you have 25 ship leaway, so you can afford 21 ships
2010-09-17T10:55:47  <bartwe_> all maps are deadlocked if you look at it like that
2010-09-17T10:55:53  <Naktibalda> isn't it a 4 distance?
2010-09-17T10:55:54  <sigh> problem is that opponent might then attack the planet you took
2010-09-17T10:55:54  <bartwe_> unless homes are seriously far apart
2010-09-17T10:56:16  <Naktibalda> bartwe_: they aren't if you can capture a neutral cheaply
2010-09-17T10:56:22  <bartwe_> best ev+ move here seems to take the enemy regardless
2010-09-17T10:56:45  <sigh> Naktibalda: looks like 5 to me
2010-09-17T10:56:50  <bartwe_> if he stays its ev0, if he returns the favor its ev0, goes anywhere else its ev+
2010-09-17T10:57:15  <Naktibalda> then it's solvable :)
2010-09-17T10:57:25  <pjreddie> what's all this ev stuff?

2010-09-17T10:57:38  <pjreddie> *oh
2010-09-17T10:58:17  <bartwe_> sure its solvable this is also precisely what im working on for bartwe.10

2010-09-17T11:00:20  <bartwe_> assuming a strong enemy makes it possible to win against strong enemies, but lose against weak enemies
2010-09-17T11:00:42  <bartwe_> because you completely mispredict reactions
2010-09-17T11:00:42  <sigh> like ragebot?

2010-09-17T11:03:01  <Naktibalda> what's wrong with server? it's at least the 4th game of this kind today
2010-09-17T11:03:05  <bartwe_> is that the server timing out maybe ?
2010-09-17T11:03:10  <sigh> both timeout at the same time?
2010-09-17T11:03:20  <bartwe_> highly unlikely
2010-09-17T11:03:24  <pjreddie> hm, are players equidistant from the 20's?
2010-09-17T11:03:30  <Naktibalda> must be an issue in server's network
2010-09-17T11:03:42  <sigh> pjreddie: I haven't checked
2010-09-17T11:04:07  <sigh> I remember someone mentioning that the server occasionally sent bad data causing both bots to timeout
2010-09-17T11:04:14  <sigh> I don't know if that has been fixed yet
2010-09-17T11:04:22  <bartwe_> aparently not
2010-09-17T11:04:44  <bartwe_> hope it doesn't interfere with the elo too much
2010-09-17T11:04:46  <Naktibalda> data causing a bot to timeout? what does it send? 1GB of rubish?
2010-09-17T11:04:53  <bartwe_> i gues slonger games are more likely to have this problem
2010-09-17T11:05:24  <sigh> Naktibalda: no just badly formatted such the the bot doesn't recognise that hte server is waiting for a response
2010-09-17T11:05:47  <Naktibalda> ah, like broken go

2010-09-17T13:05:24  <Naktibalda> you get invalid input error then you send something wrong, for example more ships than are left in planet, or negative number of ships
2010-09-17T13:06:30  <ulope> Naktibalda: Yes I understand that. But it would be nice to know which order was considered invalid since there are games that play  to completion and still show the "I" marker

2010-09-17T13:09:32  <tobiassjosten> Why are people generally splitting their fleets up? Isn't that inefficient? If your opponent nicks the neutral planet you've been wearing down, for example.
2010-09-17T13:10:23  <Naktibalda> I think that they are lazy to calculate so they send random fleets until it's enough
2010-09-17T13:10:54  <jamii_> it also makes it easy to calculate stuff as flow on a graph rather than making discrete decisions
2010-09-17T13:11:40  <hakand> flexibility, confusing the opponent

2010-09-17T13:15:40  <a1k0n> it's inefficient to split fleets up when attacking neutrals but when attacking the enemy it makes no difference

2010-09-17T13:16:24  <tobiassjosten> jamii_: No problem.
2010-09-17T13:16:33  <jamii_> think of your fleets as liquid flowing around on pipes between the planets.
2010-09-17T13:16:42  <a1k0n> my bot does have an explicit "don't send fewer than N+1 ships to an N-size neutral" rule in it
2010-09-17T13:17:24  <jamii_> you can specify quite complex strategies in terms of changing pressure
2010-09-17T13:17:30  <Naktibalda> sounds funny
2010-09-17T13:17:43  <Naktibalda> my bot has a rule "send n+1 ship to neutral"
2010-09-17T13:17:48  <jamii_> i havent actually tried it yet, i only started yesterday
2010-09-17T13:18:01  <tobiassjosten> jamii_: I grasp the idea and that's kind of what I'm doing.

2010-09-17T13:18:13  <tobiassjosten> jamii_: Though I have that rule that a1k0n decided not to use. :)
2010-09-17T13:18:13  <jamii_> but i think it will be easier to train a machine learning program on pressure rather than discrete fleets
2010-09-17T13:18:17  <jamii_> less variables
2010-09-17T13:18:34  <a1k0n> tobiassjosten: hm?  i am using that rule
2010-09-17T13:18:41  <dhartmei> it can make sense to send fewer than N+1, when you can't gather all N in the same turn (only from different sources at different distances), BUT you can get all of them there before the opponent can....

2010-09-17T13:21:55  <dhartmei> it's equally efficient: no growth for neutral. it's only less optimal because you don't gain growth for between your first shipment and completion...
2010-09-17T13:21:56  <tobiassjosten> But then you'd still have to wait for the second (or third) wave to take the planet. No difference in terms of growth. And you might risk wasting ships if you need to change your mind and defend instead.

2010-09-17T13:37:28  <dhartmei> and there are no fleets initially...
2010-09-17T13:37:50  <jamii_> i think they posted the code for generating maps. will go look for ti
2010-09-17T13:38:30  <a1k0n> would be interesting to make some maps with fleets initially, since there's nothing preventing that
2010-09-17T13:39:26  <dhartmei> if no different maps are introduced within the first weeks, people will assume those are givens, and it will be unpopular to change it at all before the finals
2010-09-17T13:39:29  <a1k0n> like you get 500 reinforcements 100 turns out
2010-09-17T13:39:34  <jamii_> the script places 23 but it looks like they plan to make it vary
2010-09-17T13:39:59  <jamii_> it goes:
2010-09-17T13:40:03  <jamii_> done = False
2010-09-17T13:40:08  <jamii_> while not done:
2010-09-17T13:40:10  <jamii_> stuff....
2010-09-17T13:40:13  <jamii_> done = True
2010-09-17T13:41:03  <Lafi> 23 planets so there is always 1 planet right in the middle ?
2010-09-17T13:41:05  <dhartmei> can elo deal with unfair maps that must be played twice with reversed positions?
2010-09-17T13:41:27  <Lafi> aren't maps mirror maps ?

2010-09-17T13:41:52  <a1k0n> dhartmei: bayeselo lets you set an advantage for one side but that would apply to all maps
2010-09-17T13:42:07  <dhartmei> ah, so we're stuck with symmetric maps, i guess.
2010-09-17T13:42:19  <pjreddie>  Aaaagh rage bot i will kill you! who invented this psycho masterpiece??
2010-09-17T13:42:22  <kcn1700> using only mirror maps for the contest is pretty fair.
2010-09-17T13:42:30  <a1k0n> i wonder if anyone submitted ragebot
2010-09-17T13:43:05  <pjreddie> it just dominates me when bases are close by

2010-09-17T13:47:31  <a1k0n> heyyy i just made a bot which can utterly dominate ragebot

2010-09-17T13:57:42  <pjreddie> seems unlikely
2010-09-17T13:58:05  <danielvf> Naktibalda: It is on the server, just not in subversion
2010-09-17T13:58:08  <dhartmei> how's the performance on the official server? has someone already submitted a cpu benchmark that communicates the measurement back as orders of ships or such?
2010-09-17T13:58:47  <danielvf> dhartmei: FYI, the server only runs at 80% of it's CPU
2010-09-17T13:59:16  <dhartmei> so it should run one bot at about the same speed (if not faster) than a stock desktop machine?
2010-09-17T13:59:41  <a1k0n> hahahah ragebot chases me all over the map on 30
2010-09-17T14:00:06  <a1k0n> wow this bot is hilarious, i'm gonna run it on benzedrine.cx
2010-09-17T14:00:12  <dhartmei> please do :)
2010-09-17T14:00:55  <dhartmei> i'm thinking about adding a feature to tcp.c that let's you specify a desired opponent (via a regex) for a game
2010-09-17T14:01:22  <dhartmei> so you could play against a specific opponent if he becomes available, or immediately, if he, too, specifies you
2010-09-17T14:02:19  <amstan> a1k0n: ok.. nvm, i'm bored, you can do it if you want

2010-09-17T14:06:08  <a1k0n> it does that already doesn't it?
2010-09-17T14:06:17  <a1k0n> it's just that most of the time all other opponents are tied up
2010-09-17T14:06:31  <a1k0n> a longer "lobby" waiting time would help

2010-09-17T16:01:30  <justin_pdx> Your root folder should be named MyBot.  At least mine did.
2010-09-17T16:01:49  <jmcarthur> any compiled languages that require a specific linking step will have to have all sources in the same directory

2010-09-17T16:16:06  <ratatata> I'm at 106, was around 80s 2 hours ago.. and my bot is not that sophisticated
2010-09-17T16:16:19  <danielvf> did sysadmin stuff after that
2010-09-17T16:16:25  <danielvf> and so can't compete anymore

2010-09-17T17:02:38  <Janzert> yeah, might want to talk to danielvf too. I seem to recall a comment from him that led me to believe that he has manually changed some files on the server so a svn update might overwrite some of his changes as well.
2010-09-17T17:03:06  <Janzert> although it should cause a conflict first :}
2010-09-17T17:03:10  <Zannick> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/diff?spec=svn310&old=233&r=361&format=side&path=/trunk/planet_wars/backend/engine.py
2010-09-17T17:03:21  <Zannick> here is the diff for the engine
2010-09-17T17:03:51  <Zannick> it is possible to update only one file with svn update backend/engine.py, *i believe*
2010-09-17T17:04:07  <Zannick> but yeah, talk to the others first, good plan
2010-09-17T17:04:09  <jmcarthur> my MyBot.hs file currently contains 4 lines of code and 222 lines of notes and ideas
2010-09-17T17:04:20  <jmcarthur> i have more code in other files though, at least
2010-09-17T17:04:32  <jamii_> 4 lines of haskell code can contain a lot of ai
2010-09-17T17:04:42  <jmcarthur> indeed, but not in this case ;)

2010-09-17T17:05:26  <rogue780> McLeopold, congrats
2010-09-17T17:05:36  <McLeopold> Thanks. :)
2010-09-17T17:05:43  <jmcarthur> i'm glad i took this much time to refine my idea though. i think it might actually stand a chance, and it will be very unique
2010-09-17T17:06:21  <McLeopold> I've already found some bugs in my official entry though...
2010-09-17T17:06:24  <jmcarthur> and taking the time to refine it has led to several orders of magnitude efficiency improvement too
2010-09-17T17:06:33  <jamii_> jmcarthur: do you have any replays yet?
2010-09-17T17:06:43  <jmcarthur> jamii_: not yet
2010-09-17T17:07:06  <jmcarthur> i'm taking my time to get this right because i can afford to
2010-09-17T17:07:08  <amstan> k, sent an email to the mailing list, this should be done sson
2010-09-17T17:07:14  <jmcarthur> we have so much time this time around :o
2010-09-17T17:07:34  <McLeopold> How long was it last year?
2010-09-17T17:07:43  <jmcarthur> a month
2010-09-17T17:07:55  <jmcarthur> i don't remember if an extra week was added or not
2010-09-17T17:08:04  <jmcarthur> i think there was an extra week though...
2010-09-17T17:08:10  <jamii_> there might be an advantage to entering late as well, if your strategy is unique
2010-09-17T17:08:12  <McLeopold> That is still a lot of time.
2010-09-17T17:08:33  <jmcarthur> jamii_: it being a search algorithm i don't think anybody will be able to infer it from watching replays
2010-09-17T17:08:33  <amstan> McLeopold: nice relay technique you got there
2010-09-17T17:08:52  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i also was completely loaded down at work around that time
2010-09-17T17:08:53  <McLeopold> Which game?
2010-09-17T17:10:27  <McLeopold> I'll credit barwe and his chain lightning of death for that idea.
2010-09-17T17:10:37  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-17T17:11:29  <McLeopold> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4537465
2010-09-17T17:11:40  <McLeopold> Would this game be a case for longer matches?
2010-09-17T17:12:55  <Zannick> why?
2010-09-17T17:13:30  <McLeopold> It feels unresolved.  I think beanhome would still have one, but it needed to go longer.
2010-09-17T17:13:32  <jmcarthur> because it looks too close to call
2010-09-17T17:13:44  <amstan> lol
2010-09-17T17:13:45  <jamii_> im gonna have to boot into windows. i cant resist tweaking my bot and the rank will never settle down
2010-09-17T17:13:55  <Zannick> there can always be games where it was too close to call at the turn limit
2010-09-17T17:14:03  <Zannick> regardless of the actual turn limit
2010-09-17T17:14:37  <McLeopold> True, but there has to be some type of metric on whether to extend or not.
2010-09-17T17:14:43  <jmcarthur> maybe it should end n turns after the last "crossover point" in forces with some minimum and maximum bound
2010-09-17T17:15:24  <jmcarthur> or it could be related to the ratio of forces perhaps
2010-09-17T17:15:26  <McLeopold> Maybe a percentage of total?
2010-09-17T17:15:33  <Naktibalda> it's a case for better bots :)
2010-09-17T17:16:01  <jmcarthur> it's not a situation i'm *too* worried about
2010-09-17T17:16:01  <McLeopold> If a lot of top bots are good at defense, it may be an issue.
2010-09-17T17:16:23  <Naktibalda> beanhome kept defending for a long time when it could capture another planet
2010-09-17T17:16:37  <McLeopold> He tried, I stole them.
2010-09-17T17:16:37  <jmcarthur> i think if we see a large proportion of games looking like this in the future we could consider some change in turn-count policy, but for now this is pretty rare and probably going to be rarer as we go (i'm guessing)
2010-09-17T17:16:59  <jmcarthur> it's just statistical noise for now
2010-09-17T17:18:04  <jmcarthur> i do agree that that game could have been completely different with a longer turn count
2010-09-17T17:18:08  <McLeopold> Maybe I should care about turns left...
2010-09-17T17:18:47  <jmreardon> the latest iteration of my bot has gotten 3/30 draws at the turn limit so far

2010-09-17T17:27:45  <jmcarthur> seriously, i think that 0 ship thing should just be silently absorbed by the engine
2010-09-17T17:27:47  <jmreardon> dhartmei: that usually means something like "won by lack of opposition", ie. the other team didn't show up
2010-09-17T17:28:13  <jmcarthur> then it's only penalizing the spammer for wasting the time on I/O
2010-09-17T17:28:31  <jmcarthur> but wouldn't kill bots making sloppy decisions

2010-09-17T17:41:21  <Zannick> 0 is ignored, not invalid
2010-09-17T17:41:26  <jmcarthur> Zannick: good :)
2010-09-17T17:41:27  <Zannick> negative is invalid
2010-09-17T17:41:36  <Zannick> that is not the live version, though
2010-09-17T17:41:46  <jmcarthur> Naktibalda: did i divide by zero because i have 0 cups of coffee on my desk? :P
2010-09-17T17:41:58  <Naktibalda> :)
2010-09-17T17:42:15  <Janzert> the example bots will sometimes send 0 sized fleets so I think it may be too late to change that to an invalid order

2010-09-17T19:20:34  <Zannick> ragebot is pretty easy to detect, though
2010-09-17T19:21:03  <Zannick> sends 100 fleets at your head on the first turn
2010-09-17T19:21:30  <a1k0n> yeah so my bot basically just expects that to happen
2010-09-17T19:25:05  <genericbob> I do a test to see if the enemy ever attacks a neutral planet.
2010-09-17T19:25:26  <justin_pdx> I see a number of people on the site registered with my old college, Portland State in Portland, OR, USA.
2010-09-17T19:25:44  <jmcarthur> genericbob: that's interesting! what do you do with that information?
2010-09-17T19:25:45  <justin_pdx> I'd really like to meet up with them.  Is there a way to email the members of an organization?

2010-09-17T19:47:40  <Naktibalda> yes, it was changed ~12h ago
2010-09-17T19:47:58  <sigh> makes sense, since that seems to be the official move limit
2010-09-17T19:48:09  <a1k0n> yeah.  good to know
2010-09-17T19:48:29  <sigh> anyone have any idea if that is going to be reviewed, or is it set in concrete?
2010-09-17T19:50:18  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: taking my time
2010-09-17T19:51:09  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: also, mine won't work with the version of ghc on the server anyway. i'm hoping we can get one of these sandbox ideas going so we can just run binaries
2010-09-17T19:51:51  <jmcarthur> failing that, i'll have to backport my code and it will probably be too slow to be competitive

2010-09-17T19:53:12  <a1k0n> bummer
2010-09-17T19:53:51  <jmcarthur> although... with my efficiency improvements of today it might still be okay...
2010-09-17T19:54:35  <jmcarthur> to backport it with any sort of efficiency i'd have to manually fuse a bunch of loops and stuff. would be very annoying and C-like, and in such a case might as well just port to C
2010-09-17T19:55:01  <genericbob> jmcarthur: sorry for the late reply... I use that to give more weight to the risk of attacking a neutral planet. Basically if I attack a neutral planet that is in a dangerous location, they could take it from me and thus expand.
2010-09-17T19:55:29  <jmcarthur> genericbob: ah! but if you attack a neutral then it's not going to be neutral when they attack anyway
2010-09-17T19:56:14  <genericbob> jmcarthur: true, but if it is closer to their planets then mine, I may not be able to keep it defended.
2010-09-17T19:56:47  <sigh> At the moment, I just refrain from attacking neutrals that are closer to my enemy
2010-09-17T19:57:49  <sigh> can't think of many situations where that is a good idea
2010-09-17T19:58:05  <justin_pdx> Yeah, the sniping recently conquered neutrals is a deadly strategy.
2010-09-17T19:58:41  <jmcarthur> it can be a good start to a finishing move if you can keep a stream of forces toward it while still building forces up for a final attack
2010-09-17T19:59:01  <jmcarthur> since then your opponent has to focus on that planet right next to him
2010-09-17T19:59:28  <jmcarthur> but you have to be pretty much winning already
2010-09-17T19:59:33  <sigh> jmcarthur: yeah, makes sense but if you can do that, you probably have the forces to attack the enemy directly?
2010-09-17T19:59:34  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-17T19:59:56  <jmcarthur> well it could be that you want to prevent the enemy from expanding to an easier neutral
2010-09-17T20:00:12  <jmcarthur> by making him have to focus on that one
2010-09-17T20:00:22  <sigh> well, if it is so easy for you to take then you WANT him to expand there
2010-09-17T20:00:34  <jmcarthur> no i mean a different neutral
2010-09-17T20:00:45  <jmcarthur> one closer to you and maybe having fewer forces there
2010-09-17T20:01:02  <sigh> hmm... that sort of strategy is too high level for me right now :)
2010-09-17T20:01:06  <jmcarthur> by attacking the neutral near the enemy you make it illogical to attack the nicer neutral
2010-09-17T20:01:24  <jmcarthur> it's still a finishing move though
2010-09-17T20:01:31  <jmcarthur> you still have to have a strong advantage already
2010-09-17T20:01:35  <jmcarthur> just finishes the game quicker
2010-09-17T20:01:37  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-17T20:01:37  <a1k0n> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=23879
2010-09-17T20:01:38  <Zannick> or attack the neutral near him, wait for him to attack it, and attack him directly
2010-09-17T20:02:13  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: jeez
2010-09-17T20:02:18  <a1k0n> dhartmei: you should put 'avg # turns' on the map statistics
2010-09-17T20:02:24  <a1k0n> that map seems to get decided quickly
2010-09-17T20:02:29  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: granted that's on one of those crazy maps that start you right next to your opponent
2010-09-17T20:02:37  <a1k0n> yeah.  that's the only thing this bot is good at
2010-09-17T20:02:53  <Zannick> hm
2010-09-17T20:02:57  <jmcarthur> that's the kind of map that i think my bot will be the worst at
2010-09-17T20:03:12  <Zannick> i've been thinking about that kind of map
2010-09-17T20:03:44  <Zannick> namely, something like what a1k0n is doing
2010-09-17T20:04:00  <a1k0n> steamrolling the opponent?
2010-09-17T20:04:18  <Zannick> no, being patient, not sending everything out on the first turn
2010-09-17T20:04:25  <Zannick> then grabbing his 5g planet
2010-09-17T20:04:37  <jmcarthur> yeah, slow expansion is wiser in that situation
2010-09-17T20:05:10  <sigh> a1k0n: mine is quicker: http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=19655
2010-09-17T20:05:40  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-17T20:06:07  <Zannick> lol
2010-09-17T20:06:17  <Zannick> the center planet is such a bad idea to go for first
2010-09-17T20:06:46  <Zannick> 7-turn win is pro
2010-09-17T20:07:07  <sigh> I wonder what the shortest valid game is
2010-09-17T20:07:25  <jmcarthur> both attack each other full force in one turn
2010-09-17T20:07:40  <Zannick> you mean without disconnects/invalid commands/timeouts?
2010-09-17T20:07:47  <sigh> yup
2010-09-17T20:07:57  <jmcarthur> actually not full force
2010-09-17T20:08:07  <jmcarthur> i guess it would have to be two turns
2010-09-17T20:08:20  <Zannick> so one person sends all their fleets to neutral planets to leave them at zero and the other sends to capture them
2010-09-17T20:08:32  <jmcarthur> one freak out and attack the other, lose, then the other attack back and win
2010-09-17T20:08:47  <Zannick> that doesn't work, since they'd have the same number of ships
2010-09-17T20:08:57  <sigh> yup, one of them has to take a neutral
2010-09-17T20:09:05  <Zannick> not take, even :)
2010-09-17T20:09:10  <sigh> :D
2010-09-17T20:09:13  <Zannick> just discard their ships without conquering

2010-09-17T20:10:08  <Zannick> can be two turns if the opponent and a 11-or-more ship neutral are 2 away
2010-09-17T20:10:46  <jmcarthur> that might be the minimal game there
2010-09-17T20:11:01  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-17T20:11:08  <Zannick> SuicideBot sends 11 ships to a neutral, RageBot sends 100 to SuicideBot's planet
2010-09-17T20:11:14  <jmcarthur> we should have that map
2010-09-17T20:11:15  <Zannick> Turn 2: RageBot takes the planet with 1.
2010-09-17T20:11:25  <Zannick> and suicidebot's ships die
2010-09-17T20:11:32  <Zannick> game over
2010-09-17T20:12:16  <jmcarthur> actually, the two starting planets have to start right next to each other for that
2010-09-17T20:12:22  <jmcarthur> not two away
2010-09-17T20:12:22  <Zannick> yes

2010-09-17T20:12:34  <Naktibalda> game starts on turn 0

2010-09-17T20:12:44  <sigh> hmm... can two planets be 0 distance?
2010-09-17T20:12:46  <Zannick> remember you never see fleets with turns remaining of 0 or total turns
2010-09-17T20:12:55  <Zannick> two planets can't be 1 apart
2010-09-17T20:13:07  <sigh> ah, ok
2010-09-17T20:13:08  <Zannick> so planets that are two apart, you'll see fleets between them for exactly 1 turn
2010-09-17T20:13:29  <jmcarthur> oh i see. i was thinking the winner waits for the loser to send ships first
2010-09-17T20:13:33  <jmcarthur> that would have made it three
2010-09-17T20:13:38  <Zannick> so the starting planets have to be two away from the center planet
2010-09-17T20:13:42  <jmcarthur> but if he moves speculatively then it's two, right
2010-09-17T20:13:48  <sigh> jmcarthur: RageBot doesn't know what "wait" means
2010-09-17T20:13:49  <Zannick> which means the shortest distance they could be is three
2010-09-17T20:13:51  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-17T20:14:17  <jmcarthur> Zannick: doesn't have to be a center planet
2010-09-17T20:14:22  <Zannick> no
2010-09-17T20:14:31  <Zannick> but the map generator makes one, then makes the map symmetric
2010-09-17T20:14:31  <jmcarthur> the planets could form an equilateral triangle
2010-09-17T20:14:47  <jmcarthur> that would be mirror symmetry
2010-09-17T20:15:03  <Zannick> sure
2010-09-17T20:15:11  <genericbob> I made a map generator for mirror symetric maps
2010-09-17T20:15:13  <jmcarthur> i guess you could say the origin is on the neutral anyway
2010-09-17T20:15:22  <Naktibalda> * * . * *  planets can be in a line
2010-09-17T20:15:23  <Zannick> the origin is neutral, yes
2010-09-17T20:15:28  <genericbob> also 3fold and 4fold rotational symatry
2010-09-17T20:15:35  <genericbob> sorry spelling

2010-09-17T20:19:58  <sigh> does your bot treat the other players independently or as one large enemy?
2010-09-17T20:22:14  <genericbob> most decisions are made assuming they are one army. But the weight adjustments (based on how I'm doing) recognise the difference between the players.
2010-09-17T20:23:34  <genericbob> Wow, I went from rank 194 to rank 152 without playing a 4th game ;)

2010-09-17T22:07:05  <rogue780> likewise, people usually don't want to give up too much about the inner workings of their bot, and that tends to go hand in hand with strategy
2010-09-17T22:09:20  <blbrown_win3> they had a guide for the tron bot challenge

2010-09-17T23:23:20  <Zannick> okay, i have written my own ceilsqrt function
2010-09-17T23:24:44  <Zannick> it...uh...binary searches for the smallest integer x such that x^2 is greater than the value given

2010-09-17T23:25:23  <Janzert> if I remember correctly last contest STL was added to the C++ linking so I would think libm shouldn't be a problem to get added for C. Especially since it would seem like any serious bot is going to want it
2010-09-17T23:25:33  <Zannick> eh
2010-09-17T23:25:46  <Zannick> i wonder if this is an optimization on ceil(sqrt())
2010-09-17T23:26:25  <Zannick> oh wait
2010-09-17T23:26:27  <Janzert> possibly, even better since there is such a small number of distances in use just build a table at program startup
2010-09-17T23:26:32  <Zannick> oh
2010-09-17T23:26:34  <Zannick> they do link it
2010-09-17T23:27:08  <Zannick> the linking command includes '-lm'
2010-09-17T23:27:11  <Zannick> for both c and c++
2010-09-17T23:27:17  <Janzert> ahh :)
2010-09-17T23:28:15  <Zannick> also, explicitly linking stl isn't necessary with g++, i believe
2010-09-17T23:30:04  <Janzert> oh, maybe not. I thought I remembered someone needing to request it last time but I'm probably wrong
