2011-02-27T00:15:55  <jmcarthur> for each ant it attempts north, east, south, west, or no move, in that order
2011-02-27T00:16:09  <jmcarthur> it doesn't move into walls, but it doesn't bother checking for collisions with other ants

2011-02-27T00:17:42  <antimatroid1> there's 3 very rough asymmetric maps
2011-02-27T00:17:55  <jmcarthur> woah crazy
2011-02-27T00:18:37  <antimatroid1> each person has an equal number of walls and food squares in their "starting region"
2011-02-27T00:18:52  <antimatroid1> that isn't centered though
2011-02-27T00:18:56  <antimatroid1> that might be unfair
2011-02-27T00:18:59  <antimatroid1> i might beed to change that

2011-02-27T00:19:36  <jmcarthur> not everybody has
2011-02-27T00:19:48  <jmcarthur> i think it's just that we're open to experiment with it early on

2011-02-27T00:21:38  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty opposed to them, but i'm happy to play around with them

2011-02-27T00:41:29  <antimatroid1> the map gen is slow as hell too
2011-02-27T00:41:58  <jmcarthur> ah the latter is a result of the former i think
2011-02-27T00:42:09  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/jQHl9ZSv
2011-02-27T00:42:11  <antimatroid1> that's the code atm
2011-02-27T00:42:56  <flag> I think it would be interesting to have a few different types of maps. Some like the ones you're making now, some that are more "maze-like" and others that are just conventional hand-made maps
2011-02-27T00:43:01  <antimatroid1> is valid kills efficiency, i think there's a better way to try and find a loop with walls from what you just added
2011-02-27T00:45:08  <jmcarthur> a map gen that uses perlin noise in some way would be awesome
2011-02-27T00:45:59  <antimatroid1> what's perlin noise?
2011-02-27T00:46:07  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't mind making an actual maze map gen
2011-02-27T00:46:25  <antimatroid1> there are some cool algorithms for making mazes that i've never actually implemented
2011-02-27T00:46:37  <amstan> antimatroid1: is that in the repo?
2011-02-27T00:46:55  <antimatroid1> amstan: no, i just threw it together from my other generator then
2011-02-27T00:47:02  <antimatroid1> i want to clean both up and provide both
2011-02-27T00:47:20  <amstan> you should put it in the repo, that way we have old versions of it too
2011-02-27T00:47:26  <amstan> that's the purpose of the repo..
2011-02-27T00:47:32  <amstan> it doesn't have to be clean
2011-02-27T00:48:16  <antimatroid1> i also can't use github to save my life, i need to fix that :P
2011-02-27T00:48:35  <amstan> you don't have to know how to use github, you have to know how to use git
2011-02-27T00:48:40  <jmcarthur> perlin noise is a pseudo random noise with details that have some uniformity
2011-02-27T00:49:08  <jmcarthur> it's gradient noise, but you can adapt it to a lot of things
2011-02-27T00:49:25  <jmcarthur> it's often used for things like terrain generation and stuff
2011-02-27T00:49:43  <amstan> chris___0076: you might want to look into that
2011-02-27T00:49:49  <amstan> you have experience with that
2011-02-27T00:50:42  <antimatroid1> perlin noise looks awesome
2011-02-27T00:54:24  <antimatroid1> the problem is it is meant to scale values between -1 and 1, not give me a 0 or 1 value
2011-02-27T00:55:03  <amstan> you mean int((floatoutput+1)/2)
2011-02-27T00:55:44  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: just pick a threshold. above the threshold is 1 and below is 0
2011-02-27T00:55:57  <antimatroid1> hmm, okay, i'll play
2011-02-27T00:56:36  <jmcarthur> you could even pick two thresholds. the lowest end of the range could be water, the middle land, and the top food
2011-02-27T00:56:58  <jmcarthur> that would put food at some distance from water, overall
2011-02-27T00:57:22  <jmcarthur> and there would tend to be more food in large chunks of land relative to smaller chunks of land
2011-02-27T00:57:47  <jmcarthur> the only thing to be concerned about is connectivity, i think
2011-02-27T00:59:18  <antimatroid1> yeah, that sounds cool
2011-02-27T00:59:25  <antimatroid1> not sure how it's going to deal with connectivity

2011-02-27T00:59:44  <amstan> antimatroid1: flood fill
2011-02-27T01:00:04  <antimatroid1> amstan: yes, but you essentially want to generate the map and then check, that's very expensive when you're throwing most out
2011-02-27T01:00:44  <amstan> so?
2011-02-27T01:00:53  <amstan> it doesn't have to be that fast
2011-02-27T01:01:01  <antimatroid1> that would be unbearably slow
2011-02-27T01:01:06  <amstan> you could throw away like 10 maps if they don't meet the guideline
2011-02-27T01:01:14  <amstan> 9 out of 10 sorry
2011-02-27T01:01:57  <amstan> if they're not connected you could even try detecting a choke point in the walls and make it a tunnel
2011-02-27T01:02:17  <jmcarthur> i would generate the gradient, generate a map with some thresholds, check the map, adjust thresholds, check again, and so on until it passes the check. that way you can at least guarantee that you're moving in the right direction
2011-02-27T01:02:48  <jmcarthur> that is, if the map isn't connected enough, adjust so that it generates less water from the same gradient
2011-02-27T01:03:53  <jmcarthur> probably can find a decent map within 2-4 passes most of the time, that way
2011-02-27T01:04:04  <jmcarthur> if the threshold ajustments are reasonable
2011-02-27T01:04:09  <jmcarthur> *adjustments
2011-02-27T01:12:29  <antimatroid1> alright, i've got my project for the night
2011-02-27T01:16:51  <antimatroid1> that would have been even cooler if we went with "heights" for squares that you could only walk onto if the height difference was <=h
2011-02-27T01:18:11  <jmcarthur> yeah perlin would have been ideal for that
2011-02-27T01:26:41  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: I know how to do it
2011-02-27T01:27:14  <antimatroid1> do perlin thing, sort locations based on "lowest" heigh, then incrementally add walls up to what one wants while they're valid, then add in food from the top end
2011-02-27T01:29:01  <jmcarthur> that works
2011-02-27T01:29:09  <antimatroid1> it gets a little bit messy
2011-02-27T01:29:26  <antimatroid1> ideally you want each player to have an equal amount of food near their starting location yeah?
2011-02-27T01:29:39  <jmcarthur> yeah. the food thing might not work out
2011-02-27T01:29:48  <antimatroid1> i could do it like now and force the required number of walls/food squares to be places in each players "starting" region like now
2011-02-27T01:29:58  <jmcarthur> unless you placed the players at the top four locations in the gradient
2011-02-27T01:30:07  <jmcarthur> oh, no
2011-02-27T01:30:13  <jmcarthur> that would probably stick them right next to each other
2011-02-27T01:30:18  <jmcarthur> don't do that ;)
2011-02-27T01:30:25  <antimatroid1> yeah, i can make it as fair as it is now i think
2011-02-27T01:32:06  <antimatroid1> i think this could even be done for symmetric maps almost hte same way
2011-02-27T01:32:11  <antimatroid1> i'm doing it in c++ first time though
2011-02-27T01:32:16  <jmcarthur> hmm... now i have to figure out why my starter is timing out on turn 0
2011-02-27T01:32:26  <jmcarthur> i've checked obvious things like buffer mode
2011-02-27T01:32:33  <antimatroid1> are you looking for "ready" or "go"?
2011-02-27T01:32:34  <jmcarthur> and it works if i feed it static input via command line
2011-02-27T01:32:52  <jmcarthur> looking for "ready" on turn 0
2011-02-27T01:33:48  <antimatroid1> do you know if mcleopold is sending a turn line when end comes?
2011-02-27T01:33:58  <antimatroid1> or end will come when one expects "turn turnno"?
2011-02-27T01:35:40  <jmcarthur> http://tcp.zeroviz.us/0.bot0.input  seems to have end\nscore 0 0 0 0\n<final state>
2011-02-27T01:37:04  <antimatroid1> hmm, i don't see why bots are being sent a state after end
2011-02-27T01:37:17  <antimatroid1> and i'd like to be told the number of players on the score line
2011-02-27T01:37:39  <jmcarthur> isn't the number of players implicit by the number of scores on that line?
2011-02-27T01:37:51  <antimatroid1> yeah, but i'd like to know how many i'm reading
2011-02-27T01:38:02  <jmcarthur> eh
2011-02-27T01:38:05  <jmcarthur> i don't care ;)
2011-02-27T01:38:08  <antimatroid1> i don't read a line and then process it, i read stuff straight into variables
2011-02-27T01:38:39  <antimatroid1> i could do it into a stringstream, but i imagine it means effort with c
2011-02-27T01:38:44  <jmcarthur> i read incrementally, but i'm using a parser combinator library, so it's still pretty simple
2011-02-27T01:39:15  <antimatroid1> it would be easier for some to have it and indifference to everyone else, so i don't see why not add it :P
2011-02-27T01:39:45  <jmcarthur> string "score" *> skipHSpace *> manyTill (decimal <* skipHSpace) endOfLine
2011-02-27T01:54:58  <antimatroid1> hmmm with testing fairness of asymetrical maps, if food replenishment isn't the same every game that will just throw everything out?

2011-02-27T05:11:34  <antimatroid> Frontier: is there a "link" to where i can view the current state of your visualiser?
2011-02-27T05:11:42  <antimatroid> bonus points if it doesn't crash :P
2011-02-27T05:18:41  <Frontier> well I disabled the error checking for now, so the invalid map loads :)
2011-02-27T05:19:18  <antimatroid> http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v4/ i have that link, which doesn't load a visualiser :P
2011-02-27T05:19:18  <Frontier> btw McLeopolds bot input is the same format as the replay files. That way he can feed it back into the bot and analyse the decisions.
2011-02-27T05:19:35  <antimatroid> i just got perlin noise working, now i need to turn that into a map
2011-02-27T05:19:57  <antimatroid> i'm just going to use it for water placement, otherwise food is clumped together
2011-02-27T05:20:36  <Frontier> Well here is a link, but it is not v4, it is my work in progress. So this state is usually not working until I do a commit ;)

2011-02-27T05:21:21  <Frontier> I am looking forward to the new not-so-random maps
2011-02-27T05:21:52  <Frontier> next on my todo are playback controls
2011-02-27T05:22:04  <antimatroid> it still only does 2 moves :P
2011-02-27T05:22:25  <antimatroid> i like your score bar
2011-02-27T05:22:46  <Frontier> me too, I stole the idea from Total War.
2011-02-27T05:23:16  <antimatroid> could i suggest a black border around everything with water being blue? it doesn't quite look like the top wraps
2011-02-27T05:23:52  <Frontier> but it just has to be horizontal (the score bar). border... wait a moment... that is point 3 on my todo list
2011-02-27T05:24:42  <Frontier> 11 is animated single steps because i have no clue how i should make it work with the arrow keys
2011-02-27T05:25:13  <antimatroid> can't arrow key be "hit play with a trigger to self hit pause after one turn"?
2011-02-27T05:25:45  <Frontier> I always use the arrow key to skip through the turns in fast forward
2011-02-27T05:26:10  <antimatroid> hmm, i see the problem
2011-02-27T05:26:29  <antimatroid> can the speed at which it fast forwards be relative to how recently it was pressed?
2011-02-27T05:26:34  <Frontier> Firefox is the only browser that fires only a single event for onkeydown
2011-02-27T05:27:54  <Frontier> Well I could accelerate the playback, the longer the key is held down :p
2011-02-27T05:28:50  <Frontier> But first I would write a class for that, that keeps track of the states (speed, single stepping, time, etc..)

2011-02-27T05:31:12  <antimatroid> that's me just making stuff <-.8 a wall and >0.9 a food square
2011-02-27T05:35:12  <Frontier> hmm, it still looks random to me. How much weight do the octaves have?
2011-02-27T05:36:11  <Frontier> You could try with less octaves or give the first one more strength.
2011-02-27T05:38:25  <antimatroid> yeah, i literally ripped that from a website, i'll play around
2011-02-27T05:39:52  <Frontier> I once ripped that from a web site to implement it on my graphics card. but it was horribly slow.
2011-02-27T05:43:00  <antimatroid> this is running fast enough
2011-02-27T05:43:14  <antimatroid> compared to how slow checking validity of an added wall

2011-02-27T06:16:34  <antimatroid> haha wtf, on the radio they're like "where was god when the churches fell down" referring to nz
2011-02-27T06:16:43  <antimatroid> and the fact that the minister person over there is a chick
2011-02-27T06:22:18  <Frontier> no that is still some wall pixels on land. but this time there are large free areas :)
2011-02-27T06:23:26  <antimatroid> wall pixels on land what?
2011-02-27T06:25:26  <Frontier> but I don't get the connection - the prime minister is a woman and that has something todo with god and the church? You are crazy down under. I met an Australian here who told a few people his name was Penez and he's from Mexico. His actual name is Peter. Then he claimed to have a doctor in physics. That's where he could talk to my hand.
2011-02-27T06:26:00  <Frontier> Ther is a lot of land in your maps and no big block of walls
2011-02-27T06:26:01  <antimatroid> not the prime minister, some religious lady
2011-02-27T06:26:12  <antimatroid> is that bad?
2011-02-27T06:26:48  <Frontier> religious people are called minister? ok didn't know.
2011-02-27T06:27:00  <antimatroid> i have another idea for making a map without perlin noise, i'll try that
2011-02-27T06:27:12  <antimatroid> i could have got it wrong, i don't know religious stuff very well
2011-02-27T06:27:17  <Frontier> Maybe it is ok, but the maps wont have landmarks this way and keep looking random :)

2011-02-27T07:05:24  <antimatroid> if i randomise the direction it scans out from each time, that might make some cool maps
2011-02-27T07:06:59  <Frontier> haha, that looks funny
2011-02-27T07:07:04  <antimatroid> it's cool
2011-02-27T07:07:53  <antimatroid> the idea is going to be to "grow a tree" but wrapped inside each players starting region
2011-02-27T07:08:17  <antimatroid> one can grow a tree everywhere for non-symmetric, but i think it's harder to make that fair
2011-02-27T07:13:08  <antimatroid> is there an easy way to get the size of a list in python?
2011-02-27T07:13:58  <Frontier> you ask the wrong person
2011-02-27T07:15:37  <Frontier> just append .len .length or .size. One will work

2011-02-27T07:38:32  <sigh> also, and this is mostly an aesthetic consideration, mixing a rigid grid layout for the positions with a more organic layout for the walls seems to clash
2011-02-27T07:39:07  <antimatroid> the mean the lattice look?
2011-02-27T07:39:08  <sigh> this becomes more obvious with a larger number of players
2011-02-27T07:39:13  <sigh> yeah
2011-02-27T07:39:25  <antimatroid> it's impossible to avoid for symmetric maps, even when the wall generation is completely random
2011-02-27T07:40:40  <sigh> I mean, the lattice look matches better with walls that also look artificial, like in a building
2011-02-27T07:42:27  <sigh> not a huge deal, just looks a bit odd

2011-02-27T18:42:52  <jmcarthur> i just need to document the library and make that little tutorial i've been meaning to make, now
2011-02-27T18:43:00  <j3camero> What is that?
2011-02-27T18:43:21  <jmcarthur> the haskell starter
2011-02-27T18:43:26  <j3camero> Oh okay it's referring off to another module somewhere.
2011-02-27T18:43:31  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-27T18:43:33  <j3camero> I was like.... how is this so short?
2011-02-27T18:43:33  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-27T18:43:36  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-02-27T18:43:45  <j3camero> Fucking Haskell. How does it work?
2011-02-27T18:44:06  <jmcarthur> 'Game' is a monad handling
2011-02-27T18:44:09  <jmcarthur> -- all the I/O with the engine and managing some of the game state for
2011-02-27T18:44:11  <jmcarthur> -- you.
2011-02-27T18:44:20  <jmcarthur> bah, stupid --s
2011-02-27T18:45:19  <jmcarthur> this starter will require `cabal install ants-bot` to be run on the server (once the package is up, that is)
2011-02-27T18:45:56  <jmcarthur> but i think having a package on hackage would be a good experience for getting into it
2011-02-27T18:46:21  <j3camero> Could we instead distribute the dependency as part of the starter package? That way people could change it if they want.
2011-02-27T18:46:44  <j3camero> People could get confused if they make changes, submit, then their code fails because the server doesn't have their changes.
2011-02-27T18:47:08  <jmcarthur> trust me, there's basically no reason to change it, and if people *really* want to change it they can pull it from hackage and stick it in themselves
2011-02-27T18:47:57  <jmcarthur> i don't see that scenario happening. if somebody goes through the trouble to change the library locally i don't see how they would get confused about the server not incorporating those changes
2011-02-27T18:49:19  <jmcarthur> well, okay, i don't *quite* offer enough yet that there's absolutely no reason to change it, but i will end up exposing enough in the interface that they can get the same sort of stuff as if they were doing raw I/O anyway, if they want
2011-02-27T18:49:34  <jmcarthur> so at that point there won't be any reason to change it
2011-02-27T18:49:50  <jmcarthur> unless it's a bug fix, in which case we want it in the official library anyway
2011-02-27T18:50:41  <jmcarthur> and like i said, even *if* there's some scenario i'm overlooking, they can just do what i did in the tron contest and stick a copy of the module in with their bot
2011-02-27T18:51:04  <jmcarthur> but if anybody does that, they are hardcore and know what to do anyway
2011-02-27T18:51:29  <Zannick> what if they don't pull the bugfix changes
2011-02-27T18:53:09  <jmcarthur> as long as the bugfix doesn't change the library's interface, they would still benefit from the fixes on the server even if they don't locally, and that would be safe to do
2011-02-27T18:53:48  <j3camero> It's actually a pretty common question from what I've seen: "can I change the starter package?" Usually the answer has been "yes". But now the answer will be "yes, unless you're using Haskell". I am nervous about that.
2011-02-27T18:53:59  <jmcarthur> j3camero: that's not the answer, actually
2011-02-27T18:54:38  <jmcarthur> j3camero: the answer is "yes, you can change the starter package." and also "yes, you can include your own version of the library"
2011-02-27T18:55:41  <jmcarthur> it's as simple 'cabal unpack ants-bot; cp -R ants-bot/AI my-bot/AI'
2011-02-27T18:55:48  <jmcarthur> *as simple as
2011-02-27T18:55:59  <j3camero> I see.
2011-02-27T18:56:34  <jmcarthur> hmm...
2011-02-27T18:56:57  <j3camero> I mean, it's pretty complicated I think. Generally the pattern has been that a starter package is a zip file containing a few source files. If you change any of the source files then resubmit, then your changes show up in your bot on the server.
2011-02-27T18:57:22  <jmcarthur> and that would still be the case
2011-02-27T18:57:32  <j3camero> With this it sounds like there is a dependency involving some external package system. You can over-ride it, but it's not as simple.
2011-02-27T18:57:54  <j3camero> Is there a problem with just having it laid out the same way as all the other starter packages, for consistency?
2011-02-27T18:58:02  <jmcarthur> yes. the dependency basically handles the I/O and stuff
2011-02-27T18:58:14  <jmcarthur> there is no problem except that this library is kind of hardcore
2011-02-27T18:58:36  <jmcarthur> i designed it to be ideal for both newbs and advanced programmers that need to squeeze everything they can out of it
2011-02-27T18:58:56  <jmcarthur> including the library might just confuse newbs even more because it's complex
2011-02-27T18:59:06  <j3camero> Alright. I don't like the idea of having this non-self-contained package. But it's Haskell, so I think there will be 0% of the users who are upset about the starter package being a little more hardcore.
2011-02-27T18:59:27  <j3camero> So I guess that's cool.
2011-02-27T18:59:58  <j3camero> Especially if it's consistent with the way other Haskell stuff works. Being idiomatic is important, especially with a group of people like Haskell users.
2011-02-27T19:00:11  <jmcarthur> that's the idea
2011-02-27T19:00:53  <jmcarthur> there's one potential issue that i still need to think through though
2011-02-27T19:01:33  <jmcarthur> i will not require users to have a cabal project. that would be silly. however, it might be a bit inconvenient if somebody wants to specify a particular version of the library without a cabal project
2011-02-27T19:01:55  <j3camero> Oh haha. Would anybody really do that?
2011-02-27T19:01:57  <jmcarthur> the only way to prevent that scenario would be to lock down the interface and behavior of the library
2011-02-27T19:02:10  <jmcarthur> well i just mean... what if we put some enhancements in the library?
2011-02-27T19:02:18  <jmcarthur> potentially backward incompatible ones
2011-02-27T19:02:22  <j3camero> Also, the aim here is really to get it right the first time. With all the other starter packages especially, we can't recall them. So releasing a broken starter package is terrible.
2011-02-27T19:02:39  <jmcarthur> right, that's actually a reason the library is perfect for this
2011-02-27T19:03:09  <jmcarthur> it means if there are problems we can roll out fixes and anybody that runs 'cabal update; cabal install ants-bot' can benefit from the fixes without merging them into their bot
2011-02-27T19:04:32  <jmcarthur> that's great as long as we never change the interface
2011-02-27T19:05:49  <jmcarthur> okay, i thought of a way to work out that kink pretty elegantly
2011-02-27T19:06:00  <jmcarthur> i'll just expose different modules for different major versions if i have to
2011-02-27T19:06:15  <jmcarthur> that way there will never be a backward incompatible change to an existing module

2011-02-27T19:09:38  <j3camero> I dunno man. This is sounding like a pretty complicated starter package.
2011-02-27T19:10:01  <jmcarthur> the starter package is exactly what you just looked at
2011-02-27T19:10:07  <jmcarthur> and that's it
2011-02-27T19:10:18  <j3camero> That's not the complicated part I'm talking about.

2011-02-27T19:10:58  <jmcarthur> i mean, i could make a newb friendly starter with no libraries, but most haskellers will throw it out
2011-02-27T19:11:26  <j3camero> I think we should just do that.
2011-02-27T19:11:37  <j3camero> I mean, the main purpose here is to get more people coding for fun.
2011-02-27T19:11:47  <jmcarthur> brb

2011-02-27T19:13:00  <jmcarthur> "the main purpose here is to get more people coding for fun."  <-- and i don't think most of those people are interested in fiddling with boring I/O stuff anyway
2011-02-27T19:13:20  <j3camero> If a novice is trying to take this opportunity to learn Haskell, I can see that we are potentially throwing extra roadblocks in the way. We should make it work the way that people expect by default. What a novice expects is that there are a bunch of files in the package containing Haskell source code. If any of them are changed and saved, the changes take effect. The cabal stuff is another moving piece.
2011-02-27T19:13:36  <jmcarthur> err
2011-02-27T19:13:45  <jmcarthur> i see it the exact opposite way
2011-02-27T19:13:53  <jmcarthur> to me, more code in the starter is more moving pieces
2011-02-27T19:14:24  <jmcarthur> all these other properties you said are desireable still apply
2011-02-27T19:14:33  <jmcarthur> "What a novice expects is that there are a bunch of files in the package containing Haskell source code. If any of them are changed and saved, the changes take effect."

2011-02-27T19:15:54  <j3camero> I am thinking of what's going to happen when someone downloads the package. The problem with the cabal way is that the package actually does not work when you download it. In order to get it to work, you have to put one or two commands into your command line and then it starts working. I think that it's going to deter novices if we're making them chase down the starter package's dependencies manually. The starter package should be self-contained, and sho

2011-02-27T19:17:08  <jmcarthur> j3camero: the starter package isn't self-contained anyway. they still have to at least install the haskell platform
2011-02-27T19:17:34  <jmcarthur> j3camero: and they still have to learn how to build and run the bot. this is just an extra line
2011-02-27T19:19:28  <j3camero> That's fine for seasoned Haskellers. The problem is that novices or newcomers to Haskell don't know what cabal is. They might not necessarily come in with a deep understanding of what package managers are or how they work. So that extra line is a magic line that makes everything work, but which they don't understand.
2011-02-27T19:19:48  <j3camero> I mean, I think it's cool to have this library so that all the seasoned Haskellers can benefit from the obvious benefits.
2011-02-27T19:20:28  <jbroman> j3camero: As if a newbie Java programmer understands what "jar cfe" does.
2011-02-27T19:20:39  <jmcarthur> j3camero: they don't have to understand what it is. they just have to run the command. they already have performed this process in installing the platform, and they will also have to perform this process to build and run the bot anyway
2011-02-27T19:21:20  <jbroman> I'm not even sure I buy the argument that anyone who could not run a command would understand Haskell at all.
2011-02-27T19:21:26  <j3camero> jbroman: granted, but there's no way around that. I reject logic of the form "Java is inherently hard, therefore we need not make an effort to make anything easy ever"
2011-02-27T19:21:50  <jbroman> j3camero: Do you think running that magic command actually deterred people significantly?
2011-02-27T19:21:51  <jmcarthur> IMO this makes it easier, not harder
2011-02-27T19:21:59  <j3camero> We're not saying that they are unable to run a one line command.
2011-02-27T19:22:43  <jbroman> j3camero: They don't need to understand it – why can't they just treat it like the standard library (as a black box)?
2011-02-27T19:22:47  <jmcarthur> i'd rather present a newbie with 8-10 lines of code to edit than 300-ish lines of code to navigate through
2011-02-27T19:23:06  <jmcarthur> exactly. black box is what i'm going for for newbies
2011-02-27T19:23:16  <j3camero> I just observe that many people modify the file with the helper functions in it. With this outside dependency, that is still technically possible, but it's not as simple as "open file, save changes, resubmit".
2011-02-27T19:23:42  <jmcarthur> j3camero: the modifications are usually a result of them not being very useful out of the box, which is usually because we were afraid to add too much to them
2011-02-27T19:23:57  <jbroman> Maybe include a file that mentions how to do it if you really want to. But the kind of newbie we're talking about is unlikely to need to modify the library, unless it is seriously deficient in some way.
2011-02-27T19:24:03  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i still don't see your argument about "open file, save changes, submit." you can still do that
2011-02-27T19:24:35  <jmcarthur> j3camero: open the main, edit it, submit. done.
2011-02-27T19:25:38  <jmcarthur> and i intend for the library to have *very* good documentation, btw
2011-02-27T19:25:47  <jmcarthur> and i'm including a tutorial, as well
2011-02-27T19:25:47  <j3camero> Yeah, I guess it's not going to be a huge in-practice issue. We just have to always be careful to smooth as many rough edges as we can, especially with the starter packages. The rough edge I see here is teh introduction of the magic of a package manager (which I believe cabal is sort of?)
2011-02-27T19:26:09  <jmcarthur> j3camero: yeah, the cabal command is a bit of a package manager. it comes with the platform
2011-02-27T19:26:11  <j3camero> Ah that is good.
2011-02-27T19:26:22  <j3camero> Tutorials are wicked.
2011-02-27T19:26:33  <jmcarthur> i might even make a screencast
2011-02-27T19:26:41  <j3camero> That would be sexy.
2011-02-27T19:26:47  <jmcarthur> yes, yes it would :)
2011-02-27T19:26:54  <j3camero> Get some embedded YouTube action going on.
2011-02-27T19:29:21  <j3camero> The starter packages are so fussy. What we need to understand and respect is that most people are supremely lazy. 50% of people who create accounts don't ever bother to submit a starter package. Think about that. That's a new kind of lazy. So if something happens that does not instantly fit into the contestant's pre-existing mental model of how the world works will cause them to instantly give up. If we make them learn something new, that's a risk.
2011-02-27T19:30:32  <j3camero> Like, the tutorial from Galcon was pretty successful in that respect. It asked you to open the main code file, change *one character*, then resubmit. Any more than that, and we would have seen the attrition rate go up.
2011-02-27T19:32:56  <jmcarthur> i dunno, i just see this as *way* less stuff to learn than having to figure out 300 or so lines of code
2011-02-27T19:33:10  <j3camero> They don't have to open the file though.
2011-02-27T19:33:32  <j3camero> The tutorial just says "open the file main.java and change the following line to be this instead"
2011-02-27T19:33:33  <jmcarthur> they don't have to modify the library either
2011-02-27T19:34:02  <jmcarthur> and the tutorial works the same way
2011-02-27T19:34:13  <j3camero> Yeah but there's an extra step, because they have to open up a command prompt, put in the magic command for a reason they don't undestand.
2011-02-27T19:34:20  <jmcarthur> they have to do that anyway
2011-02-27T19:34:54  <j3camero> Nope they don't.
2011-02-27T19:34:59  <jmcarthur> building and running?
2011-02-27T19:35:05  <j3camero> Don't need to.
2011-02-27T19:35:11  <jmcarthur> then they don't need the library either
2011-02-27T19:35:23  <j3camero> Yeah I guess that's true.
2011-02-27T19:35:27  <j3camero> Good point.
2011-02-27T19:53:49  <jmcarthur> yay, the main is even a little more simple now http://hpaste.org/paste/44377/ants_starter_annotation#p44381

2011-02-27T21:47:56  <Mathnerd314> depends on your definition of importance.
2011-02-27T21:48:16  <Mathnerd314> but the answer is probably no, since you can read the logs

2011-02-27T23:20:39  <antimatroid> persin noise was fail for me, it just looked random still
2011-02-27T23:21:07  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: http://codepad.org/eqwskQ8d those are my very early "tree generated water" maps
2011-02-27T23:23:33  <jmcarthur> ah i did see those
2011-02-27T23:23:46  <jmcarthur> weird that perlin didn't work out. maybe it needs a smoothing pass or something
2011-02-27T23:24:15  <jmcarthur> before quantizing it
2011-02-27T23:24:31  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-02-27T23:24:39  <jmcarthur> actually i bet you could fix it by zooming into it a bit more
2011-02-27T23:24:48  <jmcarthur> so that the features are larger
2011-02-27T23:25:16  <jmcarthur> s/zooming into/scaling/
2011-02-27T23:25:51  <antimatroid> yeah, i imagine the code i had was just awful
2011-02-27T23:26:13  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/TscjZQgU
2011-02-27T23:26:17  <antimatroid> there's some more tree like ones
2011-02-27T23:27:06  <antimatroid> it's hard to get it to branch our
2011-02-27T23:27:10  <antimatroid> out*
2011-02-27T23:27:26  <antimatroid> i might need to pick some more "starting" squares
2011-02-27T23:29:30  <jmcarthur> i'm finding that lattice pattern kind of annoying
2011-02-27T23:29:44  <antimatroid> everyone seems to think that
2011-02-27T23:29:50  <antimatroid> it's impossible to avoid with symmetric maps
2011-02-27T23:29:51  <jmcarthur> i think some sheering is called for
2011-02-27T23:29:57  <jmcarthur> at the least
2011-02-27T23:30:39  <jmcarthur> it would at least make the lattice appear less regular while still keeping things symmetrical
2011-02-27T23:30:55  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-02-27T23:31:42  <jmcarthur> e.g. each column gets rotated one square downward every n squares or something
2011-02-27T23:31:57  <jmcarthur> including initial positions of the players
2011-02-27T23:32:29  <jmcarthur> where n is chosen such that it's done a full rotation or two by the time it wraps around to the beginning again
2011-02-27T23:32:57  <antimatroid> hmm, that's an idea
2011-02-27T23:32:58  <jmcarthur> or something like that
2011-02-27T23:33:01  <antimatroid> i'll play around with it
2011-02-27T23:33:11  <jmcarthur> it would work better if you started with something having more precision and then quantizing it
2011-02-27T23:33:17  <jmcarthur> e.g. perlin noise
2011-02-27T23:37:26  <antimatroid> what i need is a "translation" amount for each row,col pos such that after n translations you get back to the starting position
2011-02-27T23:37:29  <antimatroid> that would be cool

2011-02-27T23:40:59  <McLeopold> ?
2011-02-27T23:41:18  <McLeopold> I might be a little behind
2011-02-27T23:41:23  <antimatroid> it's not exactly matching everywhere, and i'm not sure on some bits
2011-02-27T23:41:28  <McLeopold> right
2011-02-27T23:41:39  <McLeopold> My goal tonight is to get everything straight
2011-02-27T23:41:56  <McLeopold> But, it is straight in  my mind.
2011-02-27T23:42:24  <McLeopold> The reply files will be slightly different from the bot input, so I can't just run the replay through a bot.
2011-02-27T23:42:35  <antimatroid> yeah, i think it's a matter of just making stuff match up
2011-02-27T23:42:42  <McLeopold> The engine will be able to be in replay mode, so it will be easy.
2011-02-27T23:43:18  <McLeopold> Okay, don't worry about it right now.  I'll try to have stuff cleaned up with good examples in about 4 hours.
2011-02-27T23:43:24  <antimatroid> okay cool
2011-02-27T23:43:26  <McLeopold> Then, we can worry about the wiki
2011-02-27T23:43:45  <antimatroid> i have been playing around with maps
2011-02-27T23:44:43  <antimatroid> i failed miserably at doing perlin noise well, i've been trying to grow trees of water atm, but it creates tight choke holes which we don't want
2011-02-27T23:45:18  <McLeopold> It might be good to create some basic map filters
2011-02-27T23:45:32  <McLeopold> So, one could be removing choke points of a certain size
2011-02-27T23:45:45  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/TscjZQgU
2011-02-27T23:45:52  <McLeopold> Anyway, I'm going to program for awhile now...
2011-02-27T23:46:00  <antimatroid> yep, enjoi
2011-02-27T23:47:40  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: what do you think about that idea for better translating points?

2011-02-27T23:58:33  <antimatroid> that for example allows a symmetric map with no player starting in the same row or col
2011-02-27T23:59:16  <antimatroid> i think you really want to do teh "sheering" as you generate, as you're checking whether the map is feasible while adding in the water
