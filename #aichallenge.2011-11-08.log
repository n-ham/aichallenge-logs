2011-11-08T00:02:48  <datachomper1> What's a pretty basic enemy avoidance? Just stay 3 squares away from other ants?
2011-11-08T00:03:56  <roflmao> yeah
2011-11-08T00:04:00  <roflmao> however that's kind of basic
2011-11-08T00:04:16  <roflmao> I just implemented a system where when an ant is in combat with another one
2011-11-08T00:04:20  <roflmao> it counts nearby allies and nearby enemis
2011-11-08T00:04:25  <roflmao> if allies > enemies, attack
2011-11-08T00:04:29  <roflmao> if enemies > allies, run away

2011-11-08T00:05:27  <datachomper1> What the performance on your dfs?
2011-11-08T00:05:53  <datachomper1> I just implemented one for a basic 2d array and i'm getting about 25ms to dfs a 200x200 grid with no obstacles
2011-11-08T00:06:14  <roflmao> not sure
2011-11-08T00:06:19  <roflmao> but it's just a 5 step dfs
2011-11-08T00:06:23  <roflmao> so it's very minimal
2011-11-08T00:06:37  <Extrarius> datachomper1: what language is that?
2011-11-08T00:06:38  <datachomper1> err I mean bfs
2011-11-08T00:06:42  <roflmao> yea my bfs is fine
2011-11-08T00:06:46  <datachomper1> Extrarius:  python
2011-11-08T00:06:50  <LouisMartin> hey, do you know if we can have folders in the source we upload?
2011-11-08T00:06:53  <roflmao> takes maybe about 8 ms per bfs
2011-11-08T00:06:58  <roflmao> I use a lot of bfs maps
2011-11-08T00:07:04  <datachomper1> roflmao:  for how many squares?

2011-11-08T00:07:50  <roflmao> I'm using java which is faster than py
2011-11-08T00:08:06  <Extrarius> datachomper1: I have a whole-map bfs that takes about 1ms in python, so there is plenty of room for optimization.
2011-11-08T00:08:34  <Extrarius> datachomper1: but even 25 ms is fine if you run it the minimal number of times (once for food, once for enemies, once for hills, once for unseen)
2011-11-08T00:08:36  <janzert> LouisMartin: it depends on the language
2011-11-08T00:08:39  <datachomper1> Extrarius:  I thought so, but i'm unsure how I could optimize further
2011-11-08T00:08:49  <janzert> you can always try it and see if the server can handle it
2011-11-08T00:09:53  <LouisMartin> janzert: I'm in C#
2011-11-08T00:10:23  <janzert> really don't know for C#
2011-11-08T00:11:19  <LouisMartin> janzert: okay, I'll try something
2011-11-08T00:11:32  <Extrarius> datachomper1: One thing to realize is that for whole-map bfs, you don't need to do a "real" bfs, you just need to set each cell to the minimum of itself or 1+any of it's neighbors
2011-11-08T00:12:24  <Extrarius> I set all cells to some max value (255), then set each cell with food to 0, then iteratively set every cell to min(self, min(neighbors)+1)
2011-11-08T00:12:42  <Extrarius> then any ant can pick the minimum nearest cell to go toward food
2011-11-08T00:13:10  <datachomper1> Extrarius:  But you still have to set your cells in a bfs pattern, right?
2011-11-08T00:13:26  <Extrarius> define bfs pattern?
2011-11-08T00:13:38  <datachomper1> radiating out from the target cell
2011-11-08T00:14:13  <Extrarius> datachomper1: It happens automatically if you set each cell to min(self, min(neighbors)+1) over the whole map a few times
2011-11-08T00:14:40  <datachomper1> Ah so you iterate, interesting
2011-11-08T00:15:25  <Extrarius> I have a function expandmap that basically does "while bChanged: bChanged = false; for row;   for col;   value = min(self, min(neighbors)+1); if value < cell: bchanged = true; cell = value

2011-11-08T00:17:50  <Extrarius> and actually, I have a further optimization: I added code to keep track of land (default turn update does't) and walls in a map called 'terrain' then during each turn before doing BFS, i expand that map by pretending the outline of 'unseen' tiles is really 'land'. Then, I only iterate over cells that are marked as 'land'

2011-11-08T03:58:59  <antimatroid> praveen: depends on your language, implementation and number of ants/food
2011-11-08T03:59:18  <antimatroid> you can also just not collect all the food and only spend .x proportion of your time collecting food for example
2011-11-08T03:59:35  <antimatroid> or cache paths if you want etc.

2011-11-08T04:02:03  <praveen> antimatroid: yes, am implementing in Java, so I think its not that fast enough
2011-11-08T04:02:46  <retybok> praveen: I use something similar, in Go, with absolutely no caching, and it's fast enough
2011-11-08T04:02:53  <retybok> I think it's doable in Java, with care
2011-11-08T04:03:31  <pairofdice> BFS from all foods to all ants? That's fast and simple ;)

2011-11-08T04:03:38  <praveen> retybok: Ok let me try. To my knowledge, c++ is 2 times faster than Java
2011-11-08T04:03:55  <retybok> praveen: that depends on the way you write your code
2011-11-08T04:04:00  <praveen> pairofdice: thanks that will remove the necessity to track
2011-11-08T04:04:33  <praveen> retybok: Exact same implementation, c++ is faster than java - Do you agree?
2011-11-08T04:04:53  <retybok> praveen: you can't have the same implementation since the languages are different
2011-11-08T04:05:00  <retybok> in particular, the GC makes a difference
2011-11-08T04:05:08  <praveen> retybok: I mean the same algorithm
2011-11-08T04:05:17  <retybok> but yes, usually C++ ends up being faster than Java
2011-11-08T04:06:12  <praveen> have participated in some programming competitions and have observed that java is very slow. for instance check spoj , every problem has java solution but its no way close to the c++ one
2011-11-08T04:06:30  <praveen> Ok if it times out, then I should move to some other language may be

2011-11-08T08:43:05  <merkas> i want to test
2011-11-08T08:43:07  <merkas> it
2011-11-08T08:43:11  <bobbydroptable> try this

2011-11-08T08:43:14  <mcstar> just give the exe as the argument to that script
2011-11-08T08:43:28  <hkraal> Hi all, does anyone know any means to contact the organisation directly?
2011-11-08T08:43:29  <mcstar> btw, you dont need to use .exe
2011-11-08T08:43:45  <merkas> what i have to do/?
2011-11-08T08:43:59  <mcstar> boobydroptable already told you
2011-11-08T08:44:07  <bobbydroptable> would ubuntu recognise .exe as a binary ?
2011-11-08T08:44:13  <merkas> ok

2011-11-08T08:44:38  <bobbydroptable> oh you mean he doesn't need to put .exe for the filename
2011-11-08T08:44:43  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-08T08:44:50  <mcstar> no need to compile it that way

2011-11-08T08:51:13  <retybok> it's a four-line shell script...
2011-11-08T08:51:15  <merkas> haha
2011-11-08T08:51:25  <bobbydroptable> or is it because i'm using python

2011-11-08T08:52:07  <MoleM> any admin around?
2011-11-08T08:52:11  <mcstar> bobbydroptable: yes, the script takes 1 parameter, $1, and you need to give your script WITH your interpreter
2011-11-08T08:52:18  <mcstar> thats why you need quotes there
2011-11-08T08:52:24  <bobbydroptable> understood
2011-11-08T08:52:28  <mcstar> otherwise $1 would by python, $2 your bot
2011-11-08T08:52:47  <mcstar> merkas: is it working?
2011-11-08T08:52:58  <bobbydroptable> i think he was waiting for us to give him the commandline

2011-11-08T08:53:41  <mcstar> then i scratch my head

2011-11-08T09:10:36  <merkas> on gcc
2011-11-08T09:10:44  <merkas> because i used dev-cpp
2011-11-08T09:10:53  <merkas> mcstar
2011-11-08T09:11:01  <mcstar> merkas: c++ is a standard
2011-11-08T09:11:02  <merkas> if a want to change my code
2011-11-08T09:11:06  <p_l> dev-cpp uses GCC
2011-11-08T09:11:09  <mcstar> you dont need to know the compiler
2011-11-08T09:11:13  <merkas> ok

2011-11-08T09:11:28  <mcstar> devcpp uses whatever you give it to
2011-11-08T09:11:40  <oprs> are the server specs available ?
2011-11-08T09:11:41  <mcstar> its just an ide
2011-11-08T09:11:42  <merkas> if i want to make some changes in mybots code
2011-11-08T09:11:48  <oprs> I'm concerned with turn times
2011-11-08T09:11:50  <merkas> what i type
2011-11-08T09:11:54  <merkas> only to compile it
2011-11-08T09:11:56  <retybok> merkas: use any text editor
2011-11-08T09:12:01  <retybok> try "gedit" for instance
2011-11-08T09:12:03  <merkas> and see if i have anny error
2011-11-08T09:12:03  <oprs> 500ms alone doesn't mean anything
2011-11-08T09:12:08  <mcstar> oprs: yes, you get it when your bot starts, and they are on the site too
2011-11-08T09:12:08  <p_l> merkas: to compile or to get an executable?
2011-11-08T09:12:18  <merkas> ionly compile
2011-11-08T09:12:24  <p_l> cc -c file.c
2011-11-08T09:12:25  <oprs> oh, I must have missed that then, thanks mcstar
2011-11-08T09:12:26  <merkas> to see if it good the  code syntax
2011-11-08T09:12:31  <merkas> and the link it
2011-11-08T09:12:42  <p_l> or better, cc -Wall -pedantic -c file.c
2011-11-08T09:12:52  <p_l> that will show you all warnings and such
2011-11-08T09:12:53  <mcstar> g++ -c
2011-11-08T09:13:04  <merkas> good
2011-11-08T09:13:06  <merkas> thanks
2011-11-08T09:13:18  <merkas> and the n i compile the three files
2011-11-08T09:13:19  <mcstar> merkas: do yuo know what makefiles are?
2011-11-08T09:13:24  <p_l> merkas: if your file has .cpp extension, GCC will automatically switch on C++ mode
2011-11-08T09:13:30  <merkas> yes
2011-11-08T09:13:31  <p_l> or you can call it by c++
2011-11-08T09:13:36  <p_l> (options stay the same)
2011-11-08T09:13:39  <merkas> makefiles do all the job
2011-11-08T09:13:42  <mcstar> p_l: cpp is c++11 on the server
2011-11-08T09:13:47  <merkas> compiling and then  linking

2011-11-08T09:14:00  <mcstar> merkas: use .cc extension for c++03
2011-11-08T09:14:02  <p_l> mcstar: oh? no 'c++' as well?
2011-11-08T09:14:20  <p_l> oh well, C++ is a mess I am not touching :)
2011-11-08T09:14:51  <merkas> mcstar:can you tell me the procedure in the manual compiling and linking
2011-11-08T09:14:53  <merkas> the file
2011-11-08T09:14:54  <merkas> s
2011-11-08T09:14:55  <mcstar> i didnt either, but after couple of weeks im wuite confortable with it
2011-11-08T09:14:57  <merkas> in mybot
2011-11-08T09:15:29  <mcstar> g++ MyBot.cc -o MyBot
2011-11-08T09:16:05  <mcstar> merkas: you must have a MyBot.cc file, for the sever's compiler to recognize your language
2011-11-08T09:16:27  <mcstar> otherwise, it just compiles all *.cc into *.o and than links them together into MyBot
2011-11-08T09:16:43  <merkas> ok
2011-11-08T09:16:47  <merkas> thanks
2011-11-08T09:16:56  <merkas> and what i upload to server
2011-11-08T09:16:57  <merkas> ?
2011-11-08T09:17:12  <oprs> okay, let me put it another way ;)  500ms on a Pentium II with 128MB or RAM and 1000 processes running  !=  500ms on a core i7 with 16GB and only 20 processes running
2011-11-08T09:17:13  <mcstar> zip sub.zip *.cc *.hh
2011-11-08T09:17:23  <oprs> the time unit should be CPU cycles, not ms
2011-11-08T09:17:42  <oprs> or something even remotely consistent across architectures
2011-11-08T09:17:44  <bobbydroptable> oprs: just gotta wing it. lol
2011-11-08T09:17:50  <mcstar> oprs: why not micor-lightyears?

2011-11-08T09:18:21  <oprs> well, I think you missed my point
2011-11-08T09:18:23  <mcstar> btw 500ms == 500ms
2011-11-08T09:18:31  <mcstar> no matter on what machine you measure it
2011-11-08T09:18:37  <pairofdice> :>
2011-11-08T09:18:53  <oprs> I can do a whole lot more in 500ms on a core i7 than on a i386
2011-11-08T09:18:56  <bobbydroptable> don't mind mcstar he's very very pedantic
2011-11-08T09:18:58  <bobbydroptable> ^^
2011-11-08T09:19:18  <mcstar> oprs: why do you think it matters?
2011-11-08T09:19:32  <mcstar> you always know what the time is, so you can see how much you have done
2011-11-08T09:20:10  <mcstar> all the bots run on the same specs
2011-11-08T09:20:17  <mcstar> you are not in a worse position than others
2011-11-08T09:21:01  <bobbydroptable> aichallenge runs on EC2, i believe?
2011-11-08T09:21:21  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-08T09:21:39  <pairofdice> Though I would like an approximation of how much faster it runs on the server than on my pos computer
2011-11-08T09:21:51  <bobbydroptable> so are the "cores" allocated to each bot actual cores, or virtual cores?
2011-11-08T09:21:54  <oprs> pairofdice: that's the point
2011-11-08T09:22:36  <pairofdice> I'm running wildly liberal timelimits locally
2011-11-08T09:22:49  <bobbydroptable> if it was cloud computing, it may be virtually impossible to tell the spec of a "virtual core" in that case.
2011-11-08T09:23:22  <bobbydroptable> though i'm not familiar with the nitty gritty details of how the architecture works.
2011-11-08T09:23:40  <oprs> ok, so we do need to track time
2011-11-08T09:24:00  <oprs> because the target architecture/environement could be virtually anything
2011-11-08T09:24:13  <pairofdice> Yeah
2011-11-08T09:24:37  <oprs> thanks.  that answers my question.
2011-11-08T09:25:17  <bobbydroptable> i'm not sure if that was an answer at all, but if it leads you in the right direction... lol =)

2011-11-08T09:59:07  <Belerafon_L> Hi. There are question about attack. I think that the result of the battle depends only on the position of the ants on the map. There are no other factors?

2011-11-08T10:01:49  <pairofdice> Umm?
2011-11-08T10:02:02  <pairofdice> 2 ants kill eachother? Or am I missing something
2011-11-08T10:02:26  <avdg> an ant with enough coverage support won't die, an ant with equal opponents as coverage support will do suicide, an ant with not enough coverage support from his own team dies
2011-11-08T10:02:39  <Belerafon_L> Yes, but on 96 turn position of the ants is the same turn 98
2011-11-08T10:02:46  <avdg> (suicide, but still have a kill)
2011-11-08T10:02:50  <pairofdice> Belerafon_L: the visualizer shows the line before the ants move to the position where they died
2011-11-08T10:03:07  <pairofdice> If you click on the arrow that takes you step by step you notice this

2011-11-08T11:12:33  <userjjb> C++ question: I have a class whose constuctor creates a dynamic array, and destructor deletes it. I create an instance, foo, of this class inside a function, Setup(). This function is in turn in my main(). I still would like to be able to manipulate the array in fo with it's foo's functions after my Setup() function is finished. I suspect that because foo is created inside Setup() that
2011-11-08T11:12:33  <userjjb> after it ends, foo will be destructed, right? If so, is there a way to preserve foo outside the scope of Setup()?

2011-11-08T11:23:09  <delt0r_> just kidding btw

2011-11-08T11:27:50  <delt0r_> tl;dr
2011-11-08T11:28:32  <ikaros> i dont see how you profit from having a stl::pair instead of an own container for 2 values.. with template or without
2011-11-08T11:29:08  <ikaros> but i dont see any need for this anyways :)
2011-11-08T11:29:33  <delt0r_> ikaros: which is not the same as there is no need :)
2011-11-08T11:29:43  <delt0r_> but meh whatever
2011-11-08T11:29:53  <ikaros> hehe
2011-11-08T11:29:55  <delt0r_> I am glad to less C++ these days...
2011-11-08T11:30:06  <delt0r_> mind you i did lots of CORBA with telecos
2011-11-08T11:30:20  <delt0r_> not a fan
2011-11-08T11:30:36  <mcstar> ikaros: youre right, i could probably just change every std::pair to my pair
2011-11-08T11:30:54  <mcstar> the thingis that i did a hashing function for an std::pair
2011-11-08T11:31:05  <mcstar> probably i just need to change that to apply to my pair
2011-11-08T11:31:27  <ikaros> yea sounds easiest at least
2011-11-08T11:31:29  <delt0r_> hashing functions are not a lot of work---are they
2011-11-08T11:31:33  <delt0r_> ?
2011-11-08T11:31:49  <mcstar> return hash<long long>()(((long long)key.first) << 32 ^ ((long long) key.second));
2011-11-08T11:31:56  <mcstar> this is mine
2011-11-08T11:31:59  <mcstar> for a pair
2011-11-08T11:32:00  <Zao> delt0r_: A bunch of bitwise operations, maybe some arith.
2011-11-08T11:32:13  <ikaros> well for row col you can just do row*width + col
2011-11-08T11:32:16  <ikaros> should be good
2011-11-08T11:32:26  <delt0r_> yea.. easily duplicated

2011-11-08T11:32:56  <a1k0n> more than you ever need to know: http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/evahash.html
2011-11-08T11:33:23  <mcstar> Zao: good question
2011-11-08T11:33:44  <mcstar> yep, since those are all zero, OR is good
2011-11-08T11:33:53  <a1k0n> or +, which might allow slightly better instruction encodings
2011-11-08T11:34:05  <a1k0n> (or might not)
2011-11-08T11:34:15  <Zao> mcstar: Also, why a signed quantity?

2011-11-08T11:35:43  <delt0r_> oh right
2011-11-08T11:35:46  <delt0r_> didn't see that
2011-11-08T11:35:47  <mcstar> what im not sure about, is weather  need to provide an == predicate
2011-11-08T11:35:57  <mcstar> wheather I*
2011-11-08T11:36:07  <delt0r_> typically yes i would expect
2011-11-08T11:36:11  <Zao> mcstar: You do, as hashes have a tendency to collide.
2011-11-08T11:36:19  <mcstar> if the hashed values match, stl needs a way to distinguish them
2011-11-08T11:36:23  <Zao> mcstar: If you do not use the element-extraction parts of the container, you might be good wihtout.
2011-11-08T11:36:30  <Zao> (that is, just grab buckets)
2011-11-08T11:36:30  <delt0r_> if you do a hash function you need a ==
2011-11-08T11:36:43  <Zao> I'd have to hit n3290 to be sure though.
2011-11-08T11:37:40  <mcstar> a1k0n: thx for the link, pretty elaborate
2011-11-08T11:37:44  <delt0r_> I always do it even if its not needed now, since i may come back to the code and expect == to work on the same fields as hash
2011-11-08T11:38:10  <a1k0n> mcstar: as to your first question... just use first and second. :)
2011-11-08T11:38:21  <Zao> I'm pretty sure that EqualityComparable is a required concept, just not if it's for the whole container or just individual member functions.
2011-11-08T11:38:36  <mcstar> a1k0n: im gonna make a new class, that has accessors to first and second, called row() col()
2011-11-08T11:39:08  <a1k0n> why does it have to be a pair<> then?
2011-11-08T11:39:13  <Zao> mcstar: You require std::equal_to<Key> or an alternative Pred template parameter.

2011-11-08T12:10:52  <jix> mcstar: yeah but even to get that you have to look at isolated groups of ants
2011-11-08T12:10:56  <mcstar> im debugging my such tree right now
2011-11-08T12:11:02  <mcstar> thats right
2011-11-08T12:11:15  <mcstar> thats was my first point
2011-11-08T12:11:17  <mcstar> -s
2011-11-08T12:11:42  <mleise> That's probably fine, because not all ants can affect each other within 1-2 ply :p
2011-11-08T12:12:29  <mcstar> oh, i thought we will have tachyon-ants
2011-11-08T12:13:04  <mleise> oh only in the next contest. did noone tell you?

2011-11-08T12:13:54  <ajf> oh also
2011-11-08T12:14:05  <ajf> the next contest will use quantum randomness
2011-11-08T12:14:12  <mcstar> mleise: can i have time-loops also?
2011-11-08T12:14:17  <ajf> and will confirm to actual quantum mechanics
2011-11-08T12:14:23  <ajf> but locally uses string theory

2011-11-08T12:14:46  <mleise> mcstar: I think there *was* even a real time strategy game with time-loops in it. Pretty weird for the AI as well.
2011-11-08T12:15:21  <mcstar> i dont even know what that can be :D

2011-11-08T12:22:23  <mleise> I bet this game would give me headaches
2011-11-08T12:23:00  <mcstar> what are the conservation laws in that game?
2011-11-08T12:23:11  <mleise> where are my troops? oh the factory was destroyed by my enemy 20 minutes in the past with troops he just produced
2011-11-08T12:23:14  <mcstar> is matter a conserved quantity in time?
2011-11-08T12:23:18  <mcstar> energy? momentum?
2011-11-08T12:23:27  <mcstar> in time->across time
2011-11-08T12:23:57  <mleise> I have no idea
2011-11-08T12:24:10  <mcstar> if not, you can have positive gain loops

Would it have disappeared if I kept it in the present? Will it stay alive in the past?

2011-11-08T12:39:08  <Minthos> you can find out if you track them

2011-11-08T12:39:39  <delt0r_> or do you just not see them anymore after that?
2011-11-08T12:39:42  <Minthos> you need to scout the location before and after the destruction

2011-11-08T14:06:23  <Savaron> it's apparently "google sponsored" but that does not mean very much

2011-11-08T14:06:40  <Huun> Well, i only have python 3.2 on my computer and my bot runs fine. But when i upload my bot, it fails test if it's named MyBot.py3 but runs fine as a .py... Any idea?

2011-11-08T14:08:42  <mcstar> actually, you can try using binaries
2011-11-08T14:08:52  <mcstar> if it was compiled on a similar system it could run
2011-11-08T14:09:03  <mcstar> a c# binary might even be more compatible
2011-11-08T14:09:07  <mcstar> since its clr

2011-11-08T14:42:51  <ikaros> guess im giving it two days to try and tune it
2011-11-08T14:42:53  <timmaxw> Does the contest specify what machine architecture the bots will be run on? I'm considering attempting some low-level assembly magic but it might be platform-dependent.
2011-11-08T14:43:10  <ikaros> why assembly? =)
2011-11-08T14:43:22  <timmaxw> Specifically, I'm considering using coroutines.
2011-11-08T14:43:29  <timmaxw> (In C++)
2011-11-08T14:43:48  <ikaros> embed lua.h and use those coroutines :)
2011-11-08T14:43:53  <Zannick> lu4: actually if you're still logged in to your old account, could you edit your about me to have a link to your new account
2011-11-08T14:44:29  <ikaros> at least this would be a less painful way i guess
2011-11-08T14:44:34  <timmaxw> Does Lua actually use multiple OS-level stacks? I thought it just swapped out the Lua stack.
2011-11-08T14:44:56  <timmaxw> I guess if it did that it couldn't switch coroutines from within a cfunction...
2011-11-08T14:45:23  <thestinger> timmaxw: setcontext, makecontext, etc.?
2011-11-08T14:45:53  <conor_f> a destructer doesn't get run after the constructer, does it?
2011-11-08T14:46:26  <mcstar> strictly after it
2011-11-08T14:46:31  <conor_f> I thought what happened was a new class instance and the constructer is run. then when it's deleted, the destructer?
2011-11-08T14:46:34  <conor_f> amirite?

2011-11-08T14:49:38  <conor_f> I suppose something similar in the push_back:
2011-11-08T14:49:40  <timmaxw> ikaros: I can't find any information online about the platform that the code will be run on. That's why I'm asking here. Maybe I should email the contest admins.
2011-11-08T14:49:53  <ikaros> yea
2011-11-08T14:50:05  <ikaros> i guess i read it was ubuntu 11.04 64 bit

2011-11-08T14:50:43  <ikaros> yea conor_f do you have the standard constructor implemented?

2011-11-08T14:51:18  <ikaros> where do you init that vector?

2011-11-08T15:35:19  <yassya> but the sigma also might increase.

2011-11-08T15:38:59  <conor_f> don't think so tbh
2011-11-08T15:39:11  <conor_f> it's global so it can't be really
2011-11-08T15:39:29  <conor_f> and the only other scope is within a class which has only 1 instance
2011-11-08T15:39:33  <conor_f> so no, not scoping
2011-11-08T15:39:55  <conor_f> maybe it's with push_back/erase

2011-11-08T15:42:46  <conor_f> destructers are getting called randomly lol and variables are decrementing when they should be incrementing

2011-11-08T15:46:19  <Zannick> this is a global variable
2011-11-08T15:46:22  <Zannick> ?

2011-11-08T15:47:29  <thestinger> conor_f: so, what are you doing with these objects?
2011-11-08T15:47:46  <conor_f> I have a vector of them

2011-11-08T15:47:53  <conor_f> I push_back when theres a new ant
2011-11-08T15:47:59  <conor_f> erase() when one dies
2011-11-08T15:48:06  <conor_f> and skip it when it's still alive
2011-11-08T15:48:07  <thestinger> is the vector a local variable?
2011-11-08T15:48:17  <Zannick> vector copies objects when you add them, doesn't it?
2011-11-08T15:48:18  <conor_f> it's local to the State struct
2011-11-08T15:48:35  <Zannick> and/or destroys one
2011-11-08T15:48:49  <Zannick> been awhile, sorry
2011-11-08T15:48:57  <conor_f> Zannick: when you add them?
2011-11-08T15:49:03  <conor_f> I don't understand this
2011-11-08T15:49:05  <Zannick> or push_back
2011-11-08T15:49:14  <conor_f> it creates a new one
2011-11-08T15:49:29  <Zannick> yeah
2011-11-08T15:50:16  <thestinger> conor_f: it sounds like you're using the wrong data type :P
2011-11-08T15:50:19  <Zannick> and when you erase it calls the destructor
2011-11-08T15:50:38  <thestinger> conor_f: that's not what's causing the problem though ofc
2011-11-08T15:51:11  <conor_f> thestinger: you say I should use what data type?
2011-11-08T15:51:20  <thestinger> a vector is a dynamic array, it's laid out as a single block of memory
2011-11-08T15:51:22  <conor_f> Zannick: yes
2011-11-08T15:51:38  <thestinger> if you delete something in the middle it basically has to do memmove() under the hood and move everything that's after it

2011-11-08T15:53:18  <thestinger> if you have random side effects in there, you're going to have random side effects when stuff is being constructed/deconstructed
2011-11-08T15:53:22  <conor_f> thestinger: no reason I can't use them for vars though...

2011-11-08T15:55:11  <conor_f> mcstar: that would be an issue...
2011-11-08T15:55:17  <mcstar> since erase will get it, but after it will have it+1
2011-11-08T15:55:39  <mcstar> but as far as maps and sets are concerned i could delete from them wo problems
2011-11-08T15:55:54  <conor_f> so a for loop with an iter being incremented
2011-11-08T15:55:55  <mcstar> like in a simple for loop
2011-11-08T15:56:11  <conor_f> with an erase inside, needs vec.erase(it++); ?

2011-11-08T16:09:59  <conor_f> to check if its the last loop using a vector, will this work?

2011-11-08T16:10:54  <mcstar> --vec.end();

2011-11-08T16:11:25  <conor_f> huh?
2011-11-08T16:11:30  <conor_f> what does that mean?
2011-11-08T16:11:35  <mcstar> you definitely shouldnt do that
2011-11-08T16:11:42  <mcstar> it might not be modifiable at all
2011-11-08T16:11:51  <mcstar> i dont think its an lvalue
2011-11-08T16:11:52  <TheLinker> (iter+1) == vec.end();
2011-11-08T16:11:55  <TheLinker> maybe
2011-11-08T16:12:03  <mcstar> no
2011-11-08T16:12:09  <mcstar> 1 is not an iterator
2011-11-08T16:12:20  <mcstar> only ++ and -- are overloaded for them

2011-11-08T16:13:08  <mcstar> btw what do you want?
2011-11-08T16:13:16  <mcstar> .end() points over the end actually
2011-11-08T16:13:19  <mcstar> not at the last element

2011-11-08T17:08:04  <Antimony> I think they may actually be trying to explore, but they only do one square at a time, and then choose a square on the other side of the map
2011-11-08T17:08:10  <Antimony> so they mostly go back and forth
2011-11-08T17:09:08  * p_l so far only did some planning. Things like formation movement, influence map, etc.
2011-11-08T17:09:26  <conor_f> p_l: that's a lot :O
2011-11-08T17:09:50  <p_l> conor_f: triangle formation was obvious to me after seeing some games
2011-11-08T17:10:07  <conor_f> but implementing it, well done :)

2011-11-08T17:10:26  <conor_f> I'm still stuck on defense system, which I'm going to need a formation of some sort for

2011-11-08T17:10:35  <conor_f> oh, well gl

2011-11-08T17:11:22  <conor_f> thestinger: static defense > no defense :P
2011-11-08T17:11:27  <thestinger> no, it was worse
2011-11-08T17:11:36  <conor_f> p_l: that is true, have until dec 18th though
2011-11-08T17:11:46  <thestinger> it slowed down food gathering enough that it was actually an inferior defense :P
2011-11-08T17:12:07  <p_l> I'm thinking of food gatherers forming reserve defense network
2011-11-08T17:12:12  <thestinger> I'm going to just make a certain number of ants stay between the hill and enemy ants

2011-11-08T17:13:58  <thestinger> when you see a single ant kill a hill in a game, it's misleading
2011-11-08T17:14:11  <thestinger> they've found your hill, so they'll probably be sending an army anyway if that ant dies
2011-11-08T17:14:37  <thestinger> and they usually have enough ants nearby (they only need 2 ants to kill any static unmoving defense)
2011-11-08T17:15:06  <thestinger> your defense will always have corners
2011-11-08T17:15:31  <thestinger> it needs to move around at least a bit or it's too easy to kill off

2011-11-08T17:25:03  <amstan> hi
2011-11-08T17:26:00  <mnstrspeed> quick question: the C# starter package implements an update with the format "r <row> <col>" indicating the removal of a food, but this isn't listed in the game specification?
2011-11-08T17:26:41  <amstan> i think we took out those a long time ago

2011-11-08T18:25:52  <maysam> i got error loging and i know my code finishes on time, but I get timeout on first turn
2011-11-08T18:26:30  <Rinum_> are you sure it finishes on time?
2011-11-08T18:26:34  <maysam> even when i set the waiting time too long, still happens
2011-11-08T18:26:58  <Rinum_> maybe it never sends the Go command?
2011-11-08T18:27:16  <maysam> go command comes from the play, not from the bot
2011-11-08T18:27:45  <maysam> also when it times out on one turn, does it get a chance to run next round or is it out?
2011-11-08T18:27:53  <Rinum_> no, your bot sends the orders and ends with sending "go"
2011-11-08T18:28:04  <Rinum_> it's out
2011-11-08T18:28:16  <Zannick> no, once you time out on one turn, your bot is done for the whole game
2011-11-08T18:28:46  <Rinum_> have a timer in your code... if the timer is close to the turn time, send "go"

2011-11-08T18:43:50  <amstan> janzert: why not?
2011-11-08T18:44:15  <amstan> janzert: as far as 64 bit player_seeds go, it's not really a problem if it overflows as long as it doesn't crash
2011-11-08T18:44:27  <janzert> right, but that's the question
2011-11-08T18:44:34  <amstan> you still have the same type of deterministic behavoir if it overflows
2011-11-08T18:44:38  <janzert> if it just overflows then it's no problem
2011-11-08T18:44:57  <amstan> i'm sure he would have noticed by now if that were a problem
2011-11-08T18:45:11  <janzert> several other starter bots have had a problem with it causing a crash though so I just wanted to make sure it really did work
2011-11-08T18:45:17  <janzert> hope so :)
2011-11-08T18:45:51  <amstan> yeah, i'm a little worried when doing merges for starter packages, but this one seemed simple enough
2011-11-08T18:45:57  <Extrarius> I've been using pypy for a while now, what is the issue?
2011-11-08T18:46:58  <janzert> Extrarius: none known with the latest release it just needs to get integrated with the contest infrastructure to install and use it
2011-11-08T18:47:16  <mcstar> lets use paronomasia instead of pun from now on, ok?
2011-11-08T18:47:59  <janzert> there was a bug fixed since the latest release that may cause problems but I don't know if it would for sure and am hoping they cut the next release in time to use that for the contest
2011-11-08T18:49:21  <Extrarius> what was the bug?
2011-11-08T18:49:33  <janzert> slow handling of stdio
2011-11-08T18:50:13  <Extrarius> I've found the faster just-about-everything-else by far overshadows that
2011-11-08T18:50:22  <janzert> amstan: I'm working on the rules update; how do you feel about the current law enforcement clause in the rules?
2011-11-08T18:50:41  <amstan> janzert: most of those were made by jeff
2011-11-08T18:50:49  <janzert> yeah, I know
2011-11-08T18:50:50  <amstan> in a jokingly manner

2011-11-08T18:51:01  <janzert> ahh
2011-11-08T18:51:05  <amstan> i wouldn't mind making them more serious
2011-11-08T18:51:09  <janzert> ok
2011-11-08T18:51:51  <janzert> since my first reaction to that is the same as I've seen repeated more than once elsewhere is that it is rather stupid and over the top
2011-11-08T18:52:09  <Zannick> that was a joke?
2011-11-08T18:52:29  <Zannick> you mean i shouldn't have called the cops on that one guy?

2011-11-08T19:14:05  <janzert> why I rewrote it say the information outside of the bot protocol
2011-11-08T19:14:28  <janzert> I edited my comment to include the "manipulating rankings by"
2011-11-08T19:14:36  <amstan> they can still encode information in the ants
2011-11-08T19:14:40  <amstan> so they can talk that way

2011-11-08T19:17:43  <janzert> guessing by looking at OS level information that is
2011-11-08T19:17:58  <amstan> i've heard some funny stories about guessing seeds
2011-11-08T19:18:02  <amstan> in RPS
2011-11-08T19:18:19  <janzert> trying to guess by in game information is allowed but I would consider a bug in the engine if possible :)
2011-11-08T19:18:31  <janzert> heh
2011-11-08T19:18:39  <amstan> is our algo complicated enough that someone who detects the seed should be awarded for his troubles?
2011-11-08T19:18:52  <janzert> he'd be able to predict all future food spawns
2011-11-08T19:19:01  <janzert> would be pretty handy I'd say
2011-11-08T19:19:11  <Extrarius> just use /dev/urandom or cryptrandgen for the seeds
2011-11-08T19:19:13  <amstan> yes, but not everything
2011-11-08T19:19:13  <roflmao> how do you invert a bfs map easily?
2011-11-08T19:19:20  <amstan> and that yes.. use /dev/random
2011-11-08T19:19:43  <roflmao> 1 / cost?
2011-11-08T19:19:55  <Extrarius> roflmao: what do you mean by "invert"?
2011-11-08T19:19:58  <janzert> Extrarius: but just having a strong seed source isn't sufficient, if you're generator then leaks that seed
2011-11-08T19:20:09  <roflmao> so I have a map that draws attention towards enemy ants
2011-11-08T19:20:12  <roflmao> enemyAntsCostMap
2011-11-08T19:20:16  <roflmao> lower cost = enemy ants
2011-11-08T19:20:22  <roflmao> ants move to lower cost squares
2011-11-08T19:20:30  <Extrarius> janzert: I don't mean use it as a source seed, but to use it as your RNG
2011-11-08T19:20:33  <roflmao> I was wondering if there is a simple way to just invert that
2011-11-08T19:20:38  <roflmao> without redoing a whole bfs
2011-11-08T19:20:49  <janzert> ahh, that can be quite slow
2011-11-08T19:21:02  <janzert> also means the game is non-reproducible
2011-11-08T19:21:25  <janzert> which is something that we require
2011-11-08T19:21:35  <Extrarius> ok, then use MT or CMWC4096 and use 512 bits of output hashed down for each generated number
2011-11-08T19:21:41  <amstan> "On a side note, the starter kit tries to use psyco which is not supported on 64-bit systems. IIRC the game servers are all 64-bit linux machines."
2011-11-08T19:21:43  <amstan> umm
2011-11-08T19:21:49  <amstan> isn't that bad?
2011-11-08T19:22:01  <janzert> you'll notice the engine seed is written to the replay file
2011-11-08T19:22:24  <janzert> amstan: yeah I have no idea why it has the psycho import
2011-11-08T19:22:51  <janzert> it certainly can't be used on the contest servers
2011-11-08T19:23:01  <thestinger> amstan: it just catches the import exception anyway
2011-11-08T19:23:07  <Extrarius> if anybody running the contest wants some help working out 'secure seeds', I'd be glad to offer advice
2011-11-08T19:23:21  <amstan> thestinger: yes, but it gives people a false impression about what the game servers have
2011-11-08T19:23:30  <thestinger> yeah, it's misleading :P
2011-11-08T19:23:31  <janzert> Extrarius: I think we're good but feel free to review the code if you want
2011-11-08T19:24:08  <thestinger> does psyco even work with python 2.7?
2011-11-08T19:24:12  <janzert> nope
2011-11-08T19:24:25  <janzert> doesn't work for 2.7 or 64bit :/
2011-11-08T19:24:37  <userjjb_> janzert: Is there an absolute limit on map sizes?

2011-11-08T19:30:46  <Extrarius> janzert: Is the ants\ants.py in github the official contest file that randomizes things?
2011-11-08T19:30:55  <janzert> if they come up with a starter bot and the command line to run it would be sufficient
2011-11-08T19:31:10  <amstan> Extrarius: i think that's the file that uses the seed
2011-11-08T19:31:24  <amstan> Extrarius: worker/engine.py might be the one with the seed generator
2011-11-08T19:31:57  <amstan> janzert: what about places to get it from? give them the deb preferred talk?
2011-11-08T19:32:14  <janzert> Extrarius: if that's where the engine_seed is being used that would be it but I've not been involved much with that code so don't know how it is layed out off hand
2011-11-08T19:32:27  <janzert> amstan: there is a natty package

2011-11-08T19:36:00  <amstan> caution: as in.. there's not many modules you'll find on the worker anyway
2011-11-08T19:36:19  <amstan> so stuff like django compatibility or stuff like that is irrelevant
2011-11-08T19:36:30  <caution> I was talking about standard library modules
2011-11-08T19:36:39  <amstan> oh, nvm then
2011-11-08T19:37:47  <Extrarius> pypy also seems to handle some modules extremely slowly (such as the array.array class), but using more basic types (eg list) is faster than python's specialized types so it's still a win
2011-11-08T19:39:37  <treeform> from my tests with python is that array.array saves on memory not speed
2011-11-08T19:39:55  <treeform> if your arrays are multi megabytes big then arrays are faster because of memory access
2011-11-08T19:40:26  <treeform> but more importantly your programs acctually fits in memory
2011-11-08T19:40:28  <caution> "PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code. It supports ctypes and can run popular python libraries like twisted and django."
2011-11-08T19:40:41  <caution> apparently it supports django amstan :P
2011-11-08T19:40:52  <amstan> caution: bad example, lol
2011-11-08T19:41:10  <Extrarius> caution: I noticed something like a 10x increase in runtime when using pypy on a ctypes-heavy app
2011-11-08T19:41:11  <amstan> caution: you're the one who said it has a restricted set of modules

2011-11-08T19:42:32  <Extrarius> amstan: looks like ants\ants.py is the only py file that references engine_seed, and it seems to use python's random.randint, which is not difficult to predict. Though in this case, the bot never directly sees the values, so it might not be easy in this case
2011-11-08T19:43:17  <amstan> Extrarius: feed free to make it use /dev/random for the engine_seed, just make sure it's nice code

2011-11-08T19:45:25  <janzert> Extrarius: it uses random.randint to get a seed so is basically using the default python seed which in python > 2.4 is from /dev/urandom if available
2011-11-08T19:46:03  <p_l> Extrarius: that's quite obvious - PyPy doesn't have to manually construct the data, and I suspect PyPy includes custom compilable PyPy...
2011-11-08T19:46:29  <janzert> see the explanation of the seed method in http://docs.python.org/library/random.html
2011-11-08T19:46:30  <p_l> ... or it might be the lisper in me not accepting that someone in such position wouldn't get rid of indirection at compile-time
2011-11-08T19:47:09  <Extrarius> janzert: the random generator is seeded from /dev/random, but from a sequence of output values, you can calculate the orignial seed
2011-11-08T19:47:11  <thestinger> ctypes is slow in CPython too, that's why people use the extension API
2011-11-08T19:47:57  <janzert> Extrarius: right, but the analysis I did of it several months ago I don't think a bot can see enough output values
2011-11-08T19:48:06  <Extrarius> ok
2011-11-08T19:48:34  <janzert> I wouldn't mind seeing it reanalysed by someone else though :)
2011-11-08T19:48:35  <Extrarius> I think I'm just stalling so I don't have to figure out how to get my bot's median score above 0

2011-11-08T20:47:12  <bobbydroptable> how could it be more costly over multiple passes?
2011-11-08T20:47:23  <mcstar> well, because of the access pattern

2011-11-08T21:01:02  <magiik> anyone know if there's a way to make the code attach to the debugger in visual studio? ( c++ )
2011-11-08T21:01:14  <magiik> i know of a way with C#, but i'm not sure if there is a similar solution for c++
2011-11-08T21:02:29  <magiik> hrm... mebe an assertion?
2011-11-08T21:06:34  <magiik> hrm... damnt that doesn't work. for some reason if i through the VS assert in there, it just crashes when i hit retry to debug
2011-11-08T21:06:42  <magiik> i guess infinite loop and attach to process it is
2011-11-08T21:12:38  <magiik> hrm.... anyone know if the C++ starter pack Timer.h is broken?

2011-11-08T21:19:06  <magiik> snip me some source code?

2011-11-08T21:20:09  <magiik> pastebin?
2011-11-08T21:20:19  <Adam_> Aim(int rowDelta, int colDelta, char symbol) {         this.rowDelta = rowDelta;         this.colDelta = colDelta;         this.symbol = symbol;     }
2011-11-08T21:20:28  <Adam_> that's what I'm really interested in
2011-11-08T21:20:44  <magiik> that looks like the initializer/constructor ?
2011-11-08T21:20:56  <magiik> just passing the params to the class so it can store them locally?
2011-11-08T21:21:13  <Adam_> yeah, but I can't figure out where this is being initialized
2011-11-08T21:21:32  <Adam_> meh
2011-11-08T21:21:40  <Adam_> let me ask a better question
2011-11-08T21:22:04  <magiik> yeah just looking at the Aim class itself
2011-11-08T21:22:05  <Adam_> Ants.java has a method called getTile
2011-11-08T21:22:07  <magiik> doesn't really tell me much about it haha
2011-11-08T21:22:21  <magiik> oh nm
2011-11-08T21:22:31  <magiik> i see it now i think
2011-11-08T21:22:41  <magiik> the Aim class represents an "aim" from a specific tile
2011-11-08T21:22:51  <Adam_> Do you have Ants.java in front of you?
2011-11-08T21:22:56  <magiik> yeah i can pull it up
2011-11-08T21:22:59  <magiik> i just downloaded the starter pack
2011-11-08T21:23:02  <Adam_> sweet.
2011-11-08T21:23:06  <Adam_> alright
2011-11-08T21:23:12  <Adam_> I'm trying to figure out
2011-11-08T21:23:15  <Adam_> why that method
2011-11-08T21:23:19  <Adam_> getTile
2011-11-08T21:23:24  <Adam_> is not returning the tile
2011-11-08T21:23:40  <Adam_> when the tile is on the right bound border of the map
2011-11-08T21:24:20  <magiik> ok so getTile will get the tile from the current location in the directino you pass it
2011-11-08T21:24:33  <Adam_> yeah
2011-11-08T21:24:40  <Adam_> so I'm doing that in my method
2011-11-08T21:24:49  <magiik> Aim just has the cardinal directions stored as characters AND as the delta x/y coords
2011-11-08T21:24:51  <Adam_> and somehow, that tile is not being added to my list
2011-11-08T21:25:09  <magiik> what is the Aim you are passing to getTile?
2011-11-08T21:25:18  *** Antimony <Antimony!~chatzilla@lawn-143-215-54-21.lawn.gatech.edu> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-08T21:25:19  <Adam_> east
2011-11-08T21:25:25  <Adam_> Aim.EAST
2011-11-08T21:26:00  <Adam_> So I was wondering if there is a bug when you ask for a tile on the edge
2011-11-08T21:26:09  <magiik> no
2011-11-08T21:26:14  <magiik> that's what the % is for
2011-11-08T21:26:17  <magiik> in getTile
2011-11-08T21:26:40  <magiik> so lets say the map has 100 columns
2011-11-08T21:26:43  <Adam_> col = 111
2011-11-08T21:26:45  <magiik> your ant is at 99,0
2011-11-08T21:26:49  <magiik> ok 111 cols
2011-11-08T21:26:53  <magiik> ur ant is at 110,0
2011-11-08T21:26:59  <magiik> east is (1,0)
2011-11-08T21:27:00  <Adam_> right
2011-11-08T21:27:04  <magiik> add those together u get 111,0
2011-11-08T21:27:09  <magiik> but 111 % 111 = 0
2011-11-08T21:27:12  <magiik> so u get 0,0
2011-11-08T21:28:04  <Adam_> shouldn't I get 111,0 returned to me?
2011-11-08T21:28:15  <magiik> no if the map has 111 columns, then 110 is the last column
2011-11-08T21:28:18  <magiik> after 110 it wraps to 0
2011-11-08T21:28:26  <magiik> 1st columns is column 0
2011-11-08T21:28:35  <Adam_> right
2011-11-08T21:28:43  <Adam_> so this map I'm looking at has
2011-11-08T21:28:46  <Adam_> 112 cols
2011-11-08T21:28:55  <Adam_> my ant is on 110
2011-11-08T21:29:02  <Adam_> I want the tile 111,0
2011-11-08T21:29:09  <magiik> so then yeah you should be getting 111,0
2011-11-08T21:29:13  <magiik> from an east move
2011-11-08T21:29:58  <magiik> the only thing I can think that might be happening is Aim is wrong?
2011-11-08T21:30:12  <magiik> what value do you get back from that function?

2011-11-08T21:37:08  <magiik> no, because eventually i will explore them all ;)
2011-11-08T21:37:10  <roflmao> all my other bfs maps are ULTRA fast
2011-11-08T21:37:17  <roflmao> well unseen tiles :P

2011-11-08T21:37:38  <magiik> i use lastseen values of tiles loosely to generate goals
2011-11-08T21:38:09  <magiik> so basically i generate explore goals for older seen tiles, and update the goals as the lastseens change
2011-11-08T21:38:13  <Adam_> Is there anything wrong with throwing all of the Aims into a set ?

2011-11-08T21:38:28  <Adam_> multiple times?
2011-11-08T21:38:36  <magiik> Adam_: i think u need to debug a little bit, i doubt the Java starter pack has a bug in it's Aim or wrap calculations
2011-11-08T21:38:54  <Adam_> I've been debugging for a week :(
2011-11-08T21:39:00  <magiik> get some debug output going somewhere, and print out things you think may be suspect, validating that what you think is going on is goign on
2011-11-08T21:39:06  <magiik> or use a remote debugger and get inside the program
2011-11-08T21:39:18  <magiik> are you using an IDE?
2011-11-08T21:39:26  <Adam_> Netbeans
2011-11-08T21:39:38  <magiik> never used netbeans, but I know eclipse allows you to remote debug
2011-11-08T21:40:20  <Adam_> Well let's talk about some of my code then, maybe I'm using the classes wrong
2011-11-08T21:40:20  <magiik> that's what i'm doing for visual studio and C++ - i put huge wait times on the playgame.py options, then put an infinite loop near the start, load it up, attach the debugger, break out of the infinite loop

2011-11-08T21:41:02  <Adam_> well, until then
2011-11-08T21:41:29  <Adam_> is there anything wrong with re-using a previously iterated set of Aims?
2011-11-08T21:41:40  <magiik> not that I can think of
2011-11-08T21:41:43  <magiik> unless you changed the set
2011-11-08T21:41:59  <Adam_> nah.
2011-11-08T21:42:04  <Adam_> but that gives me an Idea
2011-11-08T21:42:13  <Adam_> thanks for your time though :)
2011-11-08T21:42:36  <magiik> Adam_: i would recommend lots of debug/stderr/log outputs
2011-11-08T21:42:53  <magiik> print out all kidns of crap just for debugging the one problem, then you can nuke all those outputs
2011-11-08T21:43:13  <magiik> when all my debugging is turned on, my logs turn into megabytes
2011-11-08T21:43:33  <roflmao> hey Adam
2011-11-08T21:43:40  <Adam_> Hi

2011-11-08T23:29:32  <Adam__> ...java
2011-11-08T23:33:53  <Antimony> did the starter kit provide a timer?
2011-11-08T23:36:12  <Adam__> never mind, figured it out
2011-11-08T23:36:15  <Adam__> thanks though
2011-11-08T23:36:29  <Adam__> although...any tips on how that should be used?

2011-11-08T23:37:41  <bobbydroptable> well the easiest thing is to just check the time remaining
2011-11-08T23:37:55  <bobbydroptable> and not do anything computationally expensive if there isn't a lot of time left
