2011-04-09T01:18:11  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold where did Timer come from in sandbox.py? the sandbox under the planetwars tag uses an infinite loop in a threading.Thread() to do the same thing, which one was used in planetewars? should I use the Thread() method for ants?
2011-04-09T01:18:11  <contestbot> sigh: Aye, aye, sir
2011-04-09T01:19:47  <janzert> sigh: the current sandbox was a complete rewrite from planetwars
2011-04-09T01:19:58  <janzert> also the Timer just delays the start of a thread
2011-04-09T01:20:13  <janzert> I don't have any idea why it is being used though
2011-04-09T01:20:24  <sigh> ah, i see.. yeah... I got a it confused
2011-04-09T01:21:16  <janzert> it's certainly weird but it shouldn't cause any actual problem so long as the startup time for bots is kept longer than 1 second
2011-04-09T01:27:14  <antimatroid> hmmm here's an idea
2011-04-09T01:27:52  <antimatroid> we could make players starting positions "home bases" where an ant spawns every x turns, then you can also spawn using food as normal, so really every player is a part of the game until the game "has played long enough"
2011-04-09T01:28:00  <antimatroid> then the winner is just based off the current scoring
2011-04-09T01:28:50  <antimatroid> too complicated, but would be neat
2011-04-09T01:30:54  <janzert> I'd rather "overwhelming victories" end quickly

2011-04-09T01:33:38  <antimatroid> i'm not sure how quick games will be in this
2011-04-09T01:34:06  <antimatroid> even with a top bot against a half decent one it will take them a little while to whither them down to nothing
2011-04-09T01:38:08  <janzert> yes, certainly much longer than the same scenario in planetwars
2011-04-09T01:39:05  <antimatroid> there were games with less than 10 moves in that
2011-04-09T01:39:14  <antimatroid> i don't think tron even managed that without crashes?
2011-04-09T01:39:22  <janzert> I do still expect we'll need a good size gap between that scenario's length and the max turn limit so we have good ordering for close games
2011-04-09T01:39:46  <antimatroid> i think we need to start the turn limit at 1000+
2011-04-09T01:40:10  <janzert> yeah, a half decent bot could keep a tron game going for a while as well
2011-04-09T01:40:32  <antimatroid> i wish we'd used larger maps for that
2011-04-09T01:40:40  <janzert> :)

2011-04-09T01:56:08  <Stocha> so far the games i've seen between my reference bot and another average bot was lighting fast.
2011-04-09T01:56:18  <Stocha> less than 300 moves in most cases i think
2011-04-09T01:56:47  <Stocha> same goes for my bot vs himself in assymetrical settings
2011-04-09T01:57:10  <Stocha> that may be an argument for assymetrical :p But it may be the same on assymetric
2011-04-09T01:57:56  <Stocha> anyway some bots will be willing to take their time. And thoses were 1vs1
2011-04-09T01:58:18  <Stocha> @seen phire
2011-04-09T01:58:18  <contestbot> Stocha: phire was last seen in #aichallenge 3 days, 14 hours, 36 minutes, and 4 seconds ago: <phire> I'm seeing some large delays

2011-04-09T05:43:11  <Stocha> Antimatroid posted on github that 3 month felt long to him.
2011-04-09T05:43:19  <Stocha> when i though you would have like 6 month

2011-04-09T09:10:10  <janzert> last number I heard was 2 months
2011-04-09T09:13:04  <antimatroid> 2 months has always been at my suggestion i think
2011-04-09T09:13:09  <antimatroid> i am oepn to that being different
2011-04-09T09:13:15  <sigh> now the last number I've heard is also 2 months
2011-04-09T09:13:17  <antimatroid> i got that using goldy locks
2011-04-09T09:13:59  <sigh> although it's a funny number, it looks almost like a duration
2011-04-09T09:14:40  <antimatroid> duration?
2011-04-09T09:14:54  <antimatroid> i got that from tron being one month and too short, planet wars being 3 months and long
2011-04-09T09:15:01  <sigh> "2 months" is not a number :P
2011-04-09T09:15:15  <antimatroid> it's a length :P
2011-04-09T09:15:58  * antimatroid is pretty sure time would work as a norm
2011-04-09T09:16:11  <sigh> hmmm?
2011-04-09T09:16:33  <antimatroid> norms give you distance
2011-04-09T09:16:44  <antimatroid> no length
2011-04-09T09:16:48  <antimatroid> distance is metric ergh
2011-04-09T09:17:46  <sigh> in relativity time is almost equivalent to a distance, except it has a negative sign
2011-04-09T09:18:05  <sigh> ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 - dt^2
2011-04-09T09:18:14  <sigh> special relativity that is
2011-04-09T09:18:27  <antimatroid> hmm okay, i know almost nothing about physics
2011-04-09T09:19:16  <sigh> the point is that different observers in different frames of reference will disagree on dt, dx, dy, dz but will always agree on ds
2011-04-09T09:20:41  <antimatroid> i once had people arguing with me that there simply does not exists any notion of absolute reference inside the universe
2011-04-09T09:21:15  <antimatroid> i still think that's bullshit, even if what's in the universe is constantly expanding/moving, there would still be at some level, a notion of location inside that big black open space we call the universe
2011-04-09T09:22:24  *** Stocha <Stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-09T09:23:31  <sigh> well depends on what you mean by absolute reference, I guess
2011-04-09T09:24:09  <sigh> things like locations can't be absolute because different observers can't even agree on the spatial distance between things
2011-04-09T09:24:29  <antimatroid> just because two entities inside the system can't focalise on it, does it mean it doesn't exist?
2011-04-09T09:24:41  <Stocha> so it will be relative 2 month then ?
2011-04-09T09:24:49  <antimatroid> Stocha: i imagine so
2011-04-09T09:25:07  <antimatroid> everyone was getting pretty tired of planet wars at the end i'm pretty sure
2011-04-09T09:25:26  <Stocha> how long have you ben anting yourself ?
2011-04-09T09:25:43  <antimatroid> i started an actual bot like yesterday/ day before
2011-04-09T09:25:52  <sigh> the point is there is no privileged frame of reference... I mean you can claim that your own frame of reference is absolute and work from there, but that is hardly universal
2011-04-09T09:26:01  <Stocha> no i mean working on the ant framework / rules
2011-04-09T09:26:27  <antimatroid> not sure exactly, a few months
2011-04-09T09:26:45  <Stocha> one you can work on it only 3 hours / week, 2 month is pretty short :p
2011-04-09T09:27:12  <Stocha> so time management will be critical
2011-04-09T09:27:25  <antimatroid> sigh: i don't mind that, i still think when it comes down to it, there would be a 3d absolute frame of reference for the universe, i don't see how that can not be the case
2011-04-09T09:27:57  <antimatroid> Stocha: different people are going to have different time availability, different abilities etc.
2011-04-09T09:28:08  <antimatroid> some people aren't even born yet! what about them? :P
2011-04-09T09:28:51  <Stocha> i think there are absolute reference when you look at it fro the perspective of mecanum quantics. no ?
2011-04-09T09:29:12  <antimatroid> I know no physics
2011-04-09T09:29:37  <Stocha> nor i
2011-04-09T09:29:44  <antimatroid> my opinion on what should be the case with physics is usually based off what i know from maths and how that works
2011-04-09T09:29:52  <sigh> antimatroid: all inertial frames of reference are equivalent... there is no way to distinguish between them
2011-04-09T09:30:10  <sigh> that makes it kind of hard to come up with some absolute frame of reference
2011-04-09T09:30:29  <Stocha> is there a finite set of inertial frames of reference ?
2011-04-09T09:30:38  <sigh> infinite set
2011-04-09T09:30:43  <Stocha> how can you be sure ?
2011-04-09T09:30:55  <sigh> can't be sure
2011-04-09T09:30:59  <Stocha> ah okay then :)
2011-04-09T09:31:05  <antimatroid> sigh: i'm not saying we actually have to be able to say what it is and use it, hell there's an optimal solution to chess, I don't know it, but there is one
2011-04-09T09:31:37  <Stocha> chess is very restrictive compared to go :p
2011-04-09T09:31:54  <antimatroid> go has an optimal strategy too
2011-04-09T09:32:14  <Stocha> go depends on the komi you chose.
2011-04-09T09:32:24  <Stocha> there is no komi when you play chess.
2011-04-09T09:32:43  <antimatroid> meh, you know what i mean, each 2 player (zero sum?) game like that has an optimal solution
2011-04-09T09:33:00  <antimatroid> it's a bit tricker with more complicated games, but each one has at least one mixed strategy nash equilibrium at least
2011-04-09T09:33:13  <Stocha> yeah there is way of following the maximum score theoricall strategy for both player
2011-04-09T09:33:27  <Stocha> however depending on komi that might not be "perfect" play
2011-04-09T09:33:56  <Stocha> go is perfect information game.
2011-04-09T09:34:03  <Stocha> no mixed strategy in there.
2011-04-09T09:34:05  <sigh> antimatroid: well I'm finding it hard to figure out how you assign significance to a frame of reference if it can't be distinguished from others
2011-04-09T09:34:06  <Stocha> in theory
2011-04-09T09:34:29  <antimatroid> Stocha: you use a mixed strategy to pick a pure strategy, you can still use it for a single instance of a game
2011-04-09T09:34:32  <sigh> Stocha: komi is a given for a game
2011-04-09T09:34:44  <sigh> I'm not sure what your point is for that
2011-04-09T09:35:13  <Stocha> the point is, let's suppose the komi make it so that there is no sure winning strategy for black
2011-04-09T09:35:19  <Stocha> then what is "perfect" play ?
2011-04-09T09:35:40  <antimatroid> my point is that really there would be an absolute reference, that our galaxy etc. might have an orbit like our planet does etc. etc.
2011-04-09T09:35:41  <sigh> sure, then black has no winning strategy
2011-04-09T09:35:48  <sigh> that's the same problem for chess
2011-04-09T09:36:01  <antimatroid> but really, there would be a way to describe all of that if we weren't tiny specs on one of those lumps trying to work stuff out
2011-04-09T09:36:06  <Stocha> yeah. the difference with go, is that for a given value of komi, you just don't know :)
2011-04-09T09:36:27  <Stocha> god may know. But for the time being no human can be sure.
2011-04-09T09:36:38  <antimatroid> an optimal strategy doesn't necessarily mean you win
2011-04-09T09:36:52  <antimatroid> hell, if player 2 can force a win, your optimal strategy as player 1 may involve losing
2011-04-09T09:36:57  <sigh> komi just adds another "rule" to the game, it doesn't make it fundamentally different from chess
2011-04-09T09:37:18  <Stocha> Well, from i what i have seen it does.
2011-04-09T09:37:32  <sigh> in what way?
2011-04-09T09:37:38  <Stocha> the fact that the go game is "point based" rather than suddent death based.
2011-04-09T09:38:04  <sigh> sure... but we are talking from the point of view of perfect play
2011-04-09T09:38:17  <sigh> go has different strategy and objectives to chess, sure
2011-04-09T09:38:23  <Stocha> Well, there are things between go and chess that are alike. Like each player play once every turn :p
2011-04-09T09:38:55  <Stocha> Depending on komi, go might be with or without draws also.
2011-04-09T09:39:01  <sigh> yes, and they both have perfect information, so they can both (theoretically) be solved by the same algorithm
2011-04-09T09:39:06  <sigh> chess can have draws too
2011-04-09T09:39:36  <Stocha> One thing that has become evident with modern go bots, is that "perfect" play is not always the best strategy
2011-04-09T09:39:55  <Stocha> pro go payers have known that since long.
2011-04-09T09:40:00  <sigh> forget go bots, even humans are no where near perfect play
2011-04-09T09:40:03  <antimatroid> perfect play the way i describe it assumes rational opponents
2011-04-09T09:40:16  <antimatroid> and like sigh said, you aren't going to get perfect play with go
2011-04-09T09:40:20  <Stocha> no it assumes godly opponent antimatroid
2011-04-09T09:40:20  <antimatroid> so it's complicated
2011-04-09T09:40:31  <Stocha> which is opposed to devil opponent :p
2011-04-09T09:40:34  <antimatroid> rational opponents are able to play perfectly
2011-04-09T09:41:19  <antimatroid> although if you do a 2 player zero sum game, you can do no worse than what your "optimal strategy" picks out as the outcome of the game
2011-04-09T09:41:45  <antimatroid> with normal games that's not the case, which is why i'm saying people will have more room for playing around with game trees
2011-04-09T09:41:59  <antimatroid> and actually poses some cool situations for cooperating based on their past play etc.
2011-04-09T09:43:15  <sigh> and obviously if you are losing you can take risks that knowingly deviate from "optimal" strategy but which has a greater chace at winning through sub-optimal play of the opponent
2011-04-09T09:43:36  <sigh> Stocha: do you play go much?
2011-04-09T09:43:38  <antimatroid> sigh: harder to "calculate" but sure
2011-04-09T09:43:45  * antimatroid has never played go
2011-04-09T09:43:48  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-208-118.dynamic.chello.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-09T09:44:33  <Stocha> i'm an average go player.
2011-04-09T09:44:44  <Stocha> and weak go bot maker :p
2011-04-09T09:45:03  <sigh> that's a very vague statement :)
2011-04-09T09:45:08  <Stocha> yeah sure.
2011-04-09T09:45:19  <Stocha> what do you want to know exactly then ?
2011-04-09T09:45:41  <sigh> oh I don't mind if you don't want to say
2011-04-09T09:45:47  <Stocha> let's player 1000 games against a variety of opponent with exact same setting, and i'll answer.
2011-04-09T09:46:11  <sigh> just I've heard people from double digit kyu all the way up to 9d saying they are average players
2011-04-09T09:46:25  <sigh> :)
2011-04-09T09:46:33  <Stocha> i've beaten guyes that said they where 1d strength. And i have lost against game that said they where 8 kyu strength.
2011-04-09T09:46:37  <Stocha> that's about it :p
2011-04-09T09:47:08  <sigh> that's fair... average on most go servers work out to about 5k or so
2011-04-09T09:47:10  <Stocha> I have played against my iphone also.
2011-04-09T09:47:14  <Stocha> igo from iphone.
2011-04-09T09:47:21  <sigh> :)
2011-04-09T09:47:25  <Stocha> it says i'm 1 kyu. And sometime it says i'm 4d
2011-04-09T09:47:28  <Stocha> it depends
2011-04-09T09:47:38  <Stocha> probably more reliable i guess.
2011-04-09T09:47:51  <sigh> ah, I don't trust what go apps say
2011-04-09T09:47:57  <Stocha> Although it's hard to translate to 19x19
2011-04-09T09:48:08  <Stocha> well, at least there are some regularity in the setting of the games.
2011-04-09T09:48:13  <Stocha> they are 9x9 games.
2011-04-09T09:48:18  <Stocha> what about you ?
2011-04-09T09:48:27  <sigh> haven't played in a while
2011-04-09T09:48:33  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-09T09:48:34  <sigh> was low-mid dan
2011-04-09T09:48:36  <Stocha> so ?
2011-04-09T09:48:42  <Stocha> what's that ?
2011-04-09T09:48:46  <Stocha> what country also ?
2011-04-09T09:48:57  <Stocha> dans have been know to largely depends on where they are from :p
2011-04-09T09:49:01  <sigh> australia, but also on KGS
2011-04-09T09:49:20  <Stocha> low dan would be like 1d kgs from 100 games ?
2011-04-09T09:49:33  <sigh> 100 games?
2011-04-09T09:49:52  <Stocha> yeah. you can play 10 games, and say you are 8 dan. i have seen that. The guy was 8kyu.
2011-04-09T09:49:59  <Stocha> or maybe 4 kyu but well.
2011-04-09T09:50:04  <sigh> :)
2011-04-09T09:50:24  <Stocha> so i say that 100 games is more smooth for rating.
2011-04-09T09:50:33  <Stocha> but there are big differences in settings
2011-04-09T09:50:46  <sigh> I should still be able to confidently beat a KGS 1d
2011-04-09T09:50:47  <Stocha> ultra blitz might show that you have  a good speed adsl for example :p
2011-04-09T09:50:57  <sigh> haha
2011-04-09T09:51:02  <sigh> I used to play blitz on dialup
2011-04-09T09:51:09  <Stocha> so let's say you are kgs 4 dans then ?
2011-04-09T09:51:36  <Stocha> if you tell me you can confidently win against kgs 4 dans, then somehting is wrong :p
2011-04-09T09:51:44  <Stocha> because i have seen very strong kgs 4 dans :p
2011-04-09T09:51:59  <sigh> 4d on KGS gets wierd
2011-04-09T09:52:01  <Stocha> I know one that has beaten i pro with two stones.
2011-04-09T09:52:13  <sigh> I could easiy hold a 3d rank when I was in practice though
2011-04-09T09:52:47  <Stocha> i think i would be able to easilly hold 4k +
2011-04-09T09:53:32  <sigh> fair enough
2011-04-09T09:53:49  <sigh> now I feel like playing again
2011-04-09T09:53:56  <Stocha> and i certainly would have difficulty holding 2d :p
2011-04-09T09:54:02  <sigh> :)
2011-04-09T09:54:04  <Stocha> bah go is too long.
2011-04-09T09:54:12  <Stocha> ant is better. at least it's new.
2011-04-09T09:54:20  <sigh> I play fast... even with long time limits

2011-04-09T09:57:26  <sigh> :)
2011-04-09T09:57:31  <Stocha> but still he used up all it's time in the official games.
2011-04-09T09:57:40  <Stocha> he is pretty strong now
2011-04-09T09:58:30  <Stocha> go is easier when you know what your opponent thinks is his best response to your best move :p
2011-04-09T09:58:57  <antimatroid> replace go with game and yeah :P
2011-04-09T09:59:06  <sigh> yeah, I take longer against stronger players
2011-04-09T09:59:29  <Stocha> oh i saw him do that against a french 4 dan too
2011-04-09T09:59:30  <antimatroid> it must be time to cook dinner soon
2011-04-09T09:59:35  <Stocha> in unofficial games.
2011-04-09T09:59:41  <antimatroid> sigh: :P

2011-04-09T09:59:57  <antimatroid> i fell asleep earlier, there goes my semi normal sleep pattern
2011-04-09T10:00:00  <sigh> :)
2011-04-09T10:00:03  <antimatroid> Stocha: it's midnight in australia
2011-04-09T10:00:18  <Stocha> who lives in australia these days.
2011-04-09T10:00:24  <Stocha> it's radioactive isn't it ?
2011-04-09T10:00:28  <sigh> o_O
2011-04-09T10:00:33  <antimatroid> australia is awesome excepting the political climate
2011-04-09T10:00:47  <Stocha> It's close to japan.
2011-04-09T10:00:47  <jbroman> Where is there a good political climate?
2011-04-09T10:00:49  <antimatroid> and the racists

2011-04-09T10:01:30  <Stocha> okay i might be overstretching it a bit.
2011-04-09T10:01:50  <Stocha> problem with politics, is in the motivation you have to be involved in it.
2011-04-09T10:01:57  <antimatroid> our last prime minister had a law degree ffs, we wouldn't let someone become a doctor of a lawyer with a chinese degree, no matter how pure their intentions were, yet you think you can run the country, sure go for it
2011-04-09T10:02:09  <antimatroid> chinese** not law
2011-04-09T10:02:11  <antimatroid> current has law
2011-04-09T10:03:03  <antimatroid> oh you need a position don't you, we'll make you education/foreign/environment minister, you have no idea about it, but you need a position as you're on our party (RAGE!!!!)
2011-04-09T10:03:58  <Stocha> i think it's the same in just every area.
2011-04-09T10:04:15  <antimatroid> yes, and i hate it :P
2011-04-09T10:04:35  <Stocha> what would they do, if only those who fit a task are allowed to do it ?
2011-04-09T10:04:47  <antimatroid> it's a ridiculous popularity contest rather than an informed choice by the populace
2011-04-09T10:04:49  <Stocha> 99% of humanity would have nothing to do.
2011-04-09T10:05:17  <Stocha> maybe i wouldn't be trying to play ant :p
2011-04-09T10:05:27  <jbroman> antimatroid: Yup. Because even the people who DO vote don't care enough to educate themselves.
2011-04-09T10:05:27  <Stocha> at least i don't do that for money.
2011-04-09T10:05:37  <antimatroid> i would like to see people choosing among the most qualified people to fill positions, that's not clear i know, but that'd have to work better
2011-04-09T10:05:58  <Stocha> yeah. not clear indeed.
2011-04-09T10:06:09  <Stocha> how do they choose at the moment ? By emotions.
2011-04-09T10:06:23  <jbroman> antimatroid: Meritocracy. Has as many problems as democracy, sadly.
2011-04-09T10:06:25  <Stocha> it' hard to disproof that it is optimal
2011-04-09T10:06:46  <Stocha> Most really efficient team or bound by strong emotions.
2011-04-09T10:07:04  <Stocha> although they might not be the best individual players.
2011-04-09T10:07:10  <jbroman> And what emotion do politicians love to appeal to? Fear.
2011-04-09T10:07:12  <antimatroid> the ideal solution would be educating people enough that they can make an informed choice, but that isn't realistic either
2011-04-09T10:07:39  <jbroman> antimatroid: Nah, we're much too busy learning about what Kate Middleton thinks about Justin Bieber.
2011-04-09T10:07:42  <Stocha> i don't think that you can educate people
2011-04-09T10:07:58  <Stocha> you can merely encourage them strongly to educate themselves. a bit.
2011-04-09T10:08:18  <Stocha> Cheating others emotions is bad.
2011-04-09T10:08:28  <Stocha> thoses who do that should go to jail.
2011-04-09T10:08:42  <Stocha> i guess that would be 100% of the earth population :p
2011-04-09T10:09:09  <antimatroid> i also think the world would be a much nicer place if everyone would adopt the philosophy "you are free to do what you want provided you don't impede on someone elses right to do what they want without sufficient compensation that the person being impeded on doesn't actually feel like they're being impeded on"
2011-04-09T10:09:12  <Stocha> if we are sufficiently numerous or there is sufficient radioactives leaks, that dream may come true.
2011-04-09T10:09:39  <Stocha> what's compensation in this case ?
2011-04-09T10:09:47  <antimatroid> could be anything
2011-04-09T10:09:50  <antimatroid> it's a very general notion
2011-04-09T10:09:58  <Stocha> there should be no compensation
2011-04-09T10:10:11  <Stocha> it's like saying : you can polute all you want. But you'll give compensation.
2011-04-09T10:10:24  <Stocha> the only compensation is not polluting in the first place.
2011-04-09T10:10:38  <antimatroid> the idea is say you are impeding on a neighbour with noise, you are expected to provide something to the neighbour that the neighbour values at least as high as dealing with the noise
2011-04-09T10:11:05  <Stocha> you can build all the atomic stuff you want, and let them explode. But you have to give compensation once they do.
2011-04-09T10:11:07  <antimatroid> but the catch is it's not what you think will compensate them, the actual person being impeded on has to say they aren't affected netly
2011-04-09T10:11:25  <antimatroid> that gets very messy, but i'm more referring to different religions fighting over what different people believe
2011-04-09T10:11:29  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-09T10:11:31  <jbroman> Stocha: There are few things I would accept as compensation for being nuked.
2011-04-09T10:11:44  <antimatroid> or trying to limit other peoples actions based on their own beliefs like for transgenders, gay marriage etc.
2011-04-09T10:12:11  <Stocha> jbroman : that's now. But once you are, you 'll be happy to be compensated for that.
2011-04-09T10:12:42  <antimatroid> if everyone would chill out and live their live by their beliefs (you can't hold the belief that killing is good) and let others hold their own beliefs, we'd all be better off
2011-04-09T10:13:00  <antimatroid> Stocha: the party has to agree that the trade was worthwhile
2011-04-09T10:13:07  <Stocha> i though ant was an hard game. But it's simpler than reality. Reality is defficient.
2011-04-09T10:13:12  <Frontier> antimatroid: we would be in the stoneage then -.-
2011-04-09T10:13:24  <Frontier> the earth is a disk and so on
2011-04-09T10:13:34  <antimatroid> Frontier: what do you mean?
2011-04-09T10:13:51  <Stocha> some cultures have been known for valorizing death.
2011-04-09T10:13:58  <Stocha> Japan has done that.
2011-04-09T10:14:04  <Frontier> There are some false beliefs I can remember that were good to overcome.
2011-04-09T10:14:08  <Stocha> where killing could become good.
2011-04-09T10:14:15  <antimatroid> i really like japans at least stereotyped culture
2011-04-09T10:14:24  <Stocha> well any system that allow to kill criminal also.
2011-04-09T10:14:47  <antimatroid> most countries allow killing
2011-04-09T10:14:55  <antimatroid> maybe not of their own people
2011-04-09T10:14:57  <antimatroid> but they do
2011-04-09T10:15:19  <Stocha> so why do you put that killing should be forbiden ?
2011-04-09T10:15:44  <Stocha> There is no real free market if you are forbiden to kill your competitors :p
2011-04-09T10:15:49  <antimatroid> it depends on the circumstances, i was referring to an individual living in a country
2011-04-09T10:16:01  <antimatroid> it's not going to work to have people going around killing based of their judgements
2011-04-09T10:16:09  <antimatroid> i don't hold the opinion that no one deserves to be killed
2011-04-09T10:16:19  <Stocha> The only good system, is the system where there is no external rules.
2011-04-09T10:16:30  <Stocha> well that's the system humanity use i guess :p
2011-04-09T10:16:53  <antimatroid> what counts as an external rule?
2011-04-09T10:17:05  <antimatroid> is the game ending conditions to go an external rule to being an elephant?
2011-04-09T10:17:09  <Stocha> well, you get the idea :p
2011-04-09T10:17:53  <Stocha> 2 month is short. I should be coding. Although i' have no idea what i'm doing :p
2011-04-09T10:18:05  <antimatroid> i have been thinking about food collection
2011-04-09T10:18:07  <antimatroid> it's a tricky beast
2011-04-09T10:18:20  <antimatroid> i can only really think of a good way to do it with a game tree, but i want that for battles
2011-04-09T10:18:30  <Frontier> did the contest start already?
2011-04-09T10:18:31  <antimatroid> i may need to trigger one or the other based on how many ants are near enemies
2011-04-09T10:18:35  <antimatroid> Frontier: no
2011-04-09T10:19:57  <antimatroid> i have a notion of using an ant to collect more than one food item, but do you send an ant to the closest food square first, or the closest ant to the food square you can reach first and is closest to an enemy or any variation etc.
2011-04-09T10:20:20  <Stocha> it's never too soo to start understanding what the ant game is about
2011-04-09T10:20:38  <Stocha> even if you don't know the fighting rule, and the scoring rule. And the ant generation rule. And the food generation rule.
2011-04-09T10:21:06  <antimatroid> fighting is the only thing of real importance not decided
2011-04-09T10:21:19  <antimatroid> and i am waiting on jeff to come in so i can talk to him and get him to make a decision there
2011-04-09T10:21:26  <Stocha> Then there is nothing of real importance not decide.
2011-04-09T10:21:40  <Stocha> you can make people make bots.
2011-04-09T10:21:54  <Stocha> and they 'll discover the rules, when they see their official rankings games.
2011-04-09T10:23:15  <Stocha> i'm still wondering if uknown map at start is a good or a bad thing
2011-04-09T10:23:23  <Stocha> it make the game rule dependent
2011-04-09T10:23:33  <Stocha> for example, you then depend on the rule for generation the map
2011-04-09T10:23:47  <Stocha> you depend on it as much, if the map is known from start
2011-04-09T10:23:56  <antimatroid> anyone want to chime in on current strategy preferences?
2011-04-09T10:24:03  <Stocha> (although there still is a depency obviously)
2011-04-09T10:24:20  <antimatroid> i want to get damage, but otherwise what's the best simple rule? I think the support method with the battle radius reduced to sqrt(4 )
2011-04-09T10:24:27  <Stocha> what's current strategy preference ?
2011-04-09T10:24:58  <Stocha> I would go for either damage, or for radius 0/1
2011-04-09T10:25:29  <Stocha> it seems that people dislike the idea of ant swaping places withoug fighting O_o
2011-04-09T10:25:39  <antimatroid> problem with radius 0/1 is battle is essentially removed as a strategic component to the game
2011-04-09T10:25:54  <Stocha> i don't know that for sure.
2011-04-09T10:26:06  <antimatroid> the micro side of battling is
2011-04-09T10:26:09  <Stocha> but i agree that damage will give some fun things to try.
2011-04-09T10:26:12  <antimatroid> you just have to not get two ants in one fight
2011-04-09T10:26:31  <Stocha> with radius 0, you have the choice
2011-04-09T10:26:41  <Stocha> you can put one ant at a time, or several
2011-04-09T10:26:42  <antimatroid> the power method with radius 1
2011-04-09T10:26:49  <antimatroid> is that still too hard for people to understand?
2011-04-09T10:27:06  <Stocha> the jeff criterion seems very drastic
2011-04-09T10:27:16  <Stocha> to the point i'm not sure that "ant die on same squares" fits in :p
2011-04-09T10:27:47  *** berak_ <berak_!~chatzilla@82.113.106.31> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-09T10:27:48  <Stocha>  because of the swaping property
2011-04-09T10:28:10  <Stocha> still i can't think of anything simpler than that. Both for implementation and explanation
2011-04-09T10:28:26  <antimatroid> it's boring micro battle wise
2011-04-09T10:28:37  <Stocha> So let's say i support damage , and then ant die on same square.

2011-04-09T10:28:47  <Stocha> they game will still be hard anyway
2011-04-09T10:28:48  <antimatroid> my favourite part about this game is having interesting micro battle strategies to play around with
2011-04-09T10:28:59  <Stocha> but you'll have to focus on more technical things
2011-04-09T10:29:09  <Stocha> and i'm not sure it'll make it fun
2011-04-09T10:29:17  <antimatroid> yes, that's fun to me
2011-04-09T10:29:28  <Stocha> i'm talking about ant die on same square :p
2011-04-09T10:29:34  <Stocha> the damage rule, make it widder
2011-04-09T10:29:41  <antimatroid> i'm a fan of smaller things i can fully understand, rather than general larger scope things
2011-04-09T10:29:45  <Stocha> so you can choose to focus lightly on more things
2011-04-09T10:30:24  <Stocha> If you go with damage, and ant dies if it takes more than 0.7 damage. Then you got some interesting rule :p
2011-04-09T10:30:36  <antimatroid> by that i mean i like microeconomics (consumer theory mostly) to macroeconomics, algebra/analysis to applied maths etc.
2011-04-09T10:30:36  <Stocha> because you can't do anything easilly fighting wise :p
2011-04-09T10:31:09  <Stocha> I still think damage (dies if damage >=1) is the most consensual thing.
2011-04-09T10:31:20  <antimatroid> damage > 1 is silly
2011-04-09T10:31:25  <Stocha> but it doesn't fit in jeff criterion
2011-04-09T10:31:30  <antimatroid> you can potentially kill more ants than you had in the battle
2011-04-09T10:31:40  <antimatroid> damage =1 is ideal i tihnk
2011-04-09T10:31:45  <Stocha> mm
2011-04-09T10:31:56  <Stocha> i use X for ant dies if damage taken is > 1
2011-04-09T10:32:00  <Stocha> all ant do 1 damage.
2011-04-09T10:32:05  <Stocha> i think you go the reverse :p
2011-04-09T10:32:13  <antimatroid> yes, but say you have a.b.a
2011-04-09T10:32:13  <Stocha> arr
2011-04-09T10:32:18  <antimatroid> both a's only get 0.5 damage
2011-04-09T10:32:27  <Stocha> i use X for ant dies if damage taken is >= X
2011-04-09T10:32:37  <Stocha> all ant do 1 damage total.
2011-04-09T10:33:01  <Stocha> i think you use X for ant dies if damage taken is >=1
2011-04-09T10:33:07  <Stocha> and ant do X damage total :p
2011-04-09T10:33:19  <antimatroid> wtf are you on about? :P
2011-04-09T10:33:39  <Stocha> well doesn't matter :p
2011-04-09T10:33:54  <Stocha> but there are two variable. The damage ants do, and the damage ant can sustend.
2011-04-09T10:34:03  <Stocha> so you have to give both in order to discuss maters :p
2011-04-09T10:34:08  <antimatroid> damage ants can do is fixed at 1
2011-04-09T10:34:19  <antimatroid> and damage it can sustain is fixed at 1
2011-04-09T10:34:32  <antimatroid> there is no real debate there i don't think, except from you :P
2011-04-09T10:34:38  <Stocha> yeah, that's the most consensual
2011-04-09T10:34:51  <antimatroid> it's simple to understand
2011-04-09T10:34:57  <Stocha> still, if you do 1 damage, and 0.7 sustain, you end with something tricky
2011-04-09T10:35:29  <Stocha> that jeff will never agree on.
2011-04-09T10:35:46  <antimatroid> wait, that gives less ants the ability to kill more
2011-04-09T10:35:52  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-09T10:35:56  <antimatroid> that's silly
2011-04-09T10:36:00  <Stocha> but that also gives more the ability to kill less
2011-04-09T10:36:05  <Stocha> it's realistic.
2011-04-09T10:36:16  <Stocha> good formation should allow few to kill more.
2011-04-09T10:36:18  <Stocha> that's the point
2011-04-09T10:36:31  <Stocha> even (1,1) does that :p
2011-04-09T10:36:40  <Stocha> in a different sort of way.
2011-04-09T10:36:55  <Stocha> well there is no real debate anwyay.
2011-04-09T10:37:09  <antimatroid> i agree that it encourages better formations not to get owned
2011-04-09T10:37:11  <Stocha> it's hard enough to get damage(1,1) as it is.
2011-04-09T10:37:44  <antimatroid> i'm planning to try and avoid any battle where i don't kill more than i lose, at least towards the beginning of games
2011-04-09T10:38:11  <Stocha> well if scoring system make it live then you'll never want to loose more than you win
2011-04-09T10:38:12  <antimatroid> then i'll play around with when to reduce that back down to just don't lose more than you kill
2011-04-09T10:38:23  <Stocha> unless you are certain to be the only still alive at the end.
2011-04-09T10:38:25  <antimatroid> even that's tricky with multiplayer
2011-04-09T10:38:38  <antimatroid> if you fight too hard too early, you will diminish yourself to be easily taken out
2011-04-09T10:38:45  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-09T10:38:58  <Stocha> and if you loose more than you kill, you have almost certain failure
2011-04-09T10:39:05  <Stocha> be it multiplayer or 1vs1
2011-04-09T10:39:09  <Stocha> because of the scoring.
2011-04-09T10:39:25  <antimatroid> and because by definition someone has done better than you :P
2011-04-09T10:39:27  <Stocha> the scoring favors defending :p
2011-04-09T10:39:32  <antimatroid> it does
2011-04-09T10:39:42  <antimatroid> but lasting long enough to continue scoring favours expanding
2011-04-09T10:39:53  <Stocha> i hope jeff will agree on damage rule, and disagree on scoring :p
2011-04-09T10:39:57  <Stocha> and multiplayer
2011-04-09T10:40:04  <antimatroid> multiplayer is not changing
2011-04-09T10:40:28  <Stocha> yeah, but until the thing go live, i'll have room for hope.
2011-04-09T10:40:38  <antimatroid> and the scoring option doesn't make any sense for 1v1
2011-04-09T10:40:52  <Stocha> more things in favor of 1vs1 then.
2011-04-09T10:41:14  <antimatroid> how is that in favour of 1v1?
2011-04-09T10:41:38  <Stocha> i think the scoring doesn't make any sense period. 1vs1 in only a particular case of the more general rule.

2011-04-09T10:42:16  <Stocha> it's in favor of 1vs1, because it avoids to have to deal with scoring rules :p
2011-04-09T10:44:42  <antimatroid> with 1v1, ignoring the food bonus, the scoring only evaluates how well you fought against the opponent, not at all how well you expanded (so say the game ends where one bot has 90% of the ants, the score would depend just off how well they fought)
2011-04-09T10:45:00  <antimatroid> with multiplayer, as bots get eliminated, it matters that you have had enough ants to still be alive
2011-04-09T10:45:21  <antimatroid> hence you aren't just looking at how well you fought against one opponent
2011-04-09T10:51:04  <Stocha> you are also looking of how lucky you where that the opponent has chosent to fight against themselves, leaving you to take out the remainings with a good ant ratio
2011-04-09T10:51:44  <antimatroid> ?
2011-04-09T10:52:28  <Stocha> i can't understand how you can not think that in multiplayer luck will be paramount compared to 1vs1. Strategy in multiplayer will favor not making any assumption about anything.

2011-04-09T10:53:03  <antimatroid> i am very against people making assumptions :P
2011-04-09T10:53:18  <Stocha> they don't publish the rules.
2011-04-09T10:53:21  <antimatroid> multiplayer will still require skill with repeated games
2011-04-09T10:53:57  <Stocha> maps will be small. Ranking will be fuzzy.
2011-04-09T10:54:05  <antimatroid> if something is not explicitly stated in the specs, people should make no assumptions
2011-04-09T10:54:12  <Stocha> games will take lots of cpu.
2011-04-09T10:54:53  <Stocha> so they won't make any assumption about what minimal cpu they will get, nor minimal memory ? or will that be in the specs ?
2011-04-09T10:55:31  <antimatroid> that is going to be fairly unknown for a while
2011-04-09T10:55:39  <Stocha> specs should give as much information as humanly possible :p
2011-04-09T10:55:52  <antimatroid> people will be able to get a decent idea once the maximum number of players has been decided
2011-04-09T10:56:39  <Stocha> but that won't be in the specs ?
2011-04-09T10:56:57  <antimatroid> possibly
2011-04-09T10:57:14  <antimatroid> if it's a number most people will never have a problem with, probably not
2011-04-09T10:57:22  <antimatroid> if it's going to be quite restrictive, then definitely
2011-04-09T10:57:39  <antimatroid> i think everyone would agree it's better to not be too restrictive there
2011-04-09T10:58:04  <Stocha> but it would be easier to give value if the game was 1vs1 :p
2011-04-09T10:58:13  <antimatroid> we could do 4 player games where each player got the same resources as previously
2011-04-09T10:58:48  <antimatroid> although i don't know about having bots running on different cpus
2011-04-09T10:58:58  <antimatroid> i think they should all have their own or all be on the same
2011-04-09T10:59:19  <antimatroid> actually, that doesn't matter with the sigwait stuff
2011-04-09T10:59:29  <antimatroid> i think cpu will be fine, it's memory that will matter
2011-04-09T11:00:23  <antimatroid> so yeah, a 4 player game can be done with similar memory amounts to the last contest
2011-04-09T11:01:19  <antimatroid> what do people think about making it a strictly 4 player game?
2011-04-09T11:01:29  <antimatroid> would allow HEAPS of types of symmetry
2011-04-09T11:01:51  <Stocha> i certainly didn't anticipating that multiplayer will be more than 4 players :p
2011-04-09T11:02:03  <Stocha> even showing the game will be quite hard then
2011-04-09T11:02:14  <Stocha> not to mentions cascades of problems
2011-04-09T11:02:15  <antimatroid> i at least want crazy maps on tcp with 10+ players
2011-04-09T11:02:33  <antimatroid> and 200x200+ maps
2011-04-09T11:02:49  <antimatroid> just to see what happens

2011-04-09T11:03:16  <Stocha> from the spec, you'll have to have random numbers of players
2011-04-09T11:03:28  <Stocha> else there no point hiding how many players are in the game
2011-04-09T11:03:39  <Stocha> well. there probably is not point anyway.
2011-04-09T11:04:12  <Stocha> 200x200 map, with 10 000 ants might pose a problem to even basic bots.

2011-04-09T12:32:40  <Frontier> I talked with someone about object recognition from photos in this chat and got the idea that we could have a set of photos + a reference photo and the bots should select the photo from the set that matches the object on the reference photo.
2011-04-09T12:33:53  <Frontier> Just for the sake of having a different type of game, you know ^^
2011-04-09T12:35:49  <Frontier> Anyway we are still missing a mapping tool. It should support all the kinds of symmetry we can currently have from the generator.

2011-04-09T16:18:42  <Stocha> path finding is hard to break when you only move one ant.
2011-04-09T16:18:56  <Stocha> but when you are moving plenty through corridor that's another story :p
2011-04-09T16:19:28  <Stocha> sigh: what would your kgs pseudonym be ?
2011-04-09T16:20:00  <Stocha> as long as the contestbot is in here, i'm never truly gone.
2011-04-09T16:20:40  <Stocha> @later tell sigh what is your kgs pseudonym then ?
2011-04-09T16:20:40  <contestbot> Stocha: Ready to serve.
2011-04-09T16:21:39  <Stocha> I think the current engine use 2 for the sqdist of food spawning
2011-04-09T16:21:53  <Stocha> i don't see the point in having food distance spawning be more than 1
2011-04-09T16:22:26  <Stocha> i mean, it's already too easy to have chain fooding. You don't want to make it so that we can get food without even trying
2011-04-09T16:22:32  <Stocha> (like while fleeing)
2011-04-09T16:22:54  <Naktibalda> sqrt(2) is just a bit longer 1
2011-04-09T16:23:11  <Stocha> it's 2 times longer :)
2011-04-09T16:23:17  <Stocha> square wise
2011-04-09T16:23:24  <Stocha> you have all diagonals
2011-04-09T16:23:25  <Naktibalda> no, it's 1.4 - diagonal spawning
2011-04-09T16:24:02  <Stocha> yeah instead of all 4 directions, you have all 4 plus all 4 corners
2011-04-09T16:24:08  <Stocha> that makes 8 square instead of 4
2011-04-09T16:24:28  <Stocha> it's two time bigger if you wander at random
2011-04-09T16:24:35  <Naktibalda> IMO it makes calculations a bit more complicated
2011-04-09T16:24:49  <Stocha> it's two time longer to calculate
2011-04-09T16:25:00  <Stocha> :p
2011-04-09T16:25:39  <Stocha> the parameter is passed to the engine. So it may be variable
2011-04-09T16:25:50  <Stocha> maybe it will randome between 1 and 96
2011-04-09T16:26:14  <Stocha> i don't see the point for any value other than 1.
2011-04-09T16:33:13  <amstan> contestbot: uptime
2011-04-09T16:33:13  <contestbot> amstan: I have been running for 5 weeks, 4 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, and 27 seconds.
2011-04-09T16:33:22  <amstan> aww
2011-04-09T16:33:38  * amstan was hoping it would have the same uptime as the host(119 days)
2011-04-09T16:42:21  <Stocha> it bugged and died
