2011-05-15T20:15:11  <qacek> ok I guess that makes tracking state easier
2011-05-15T20:15:25  <McLeopold> for the engine, yes
2011-05-15T20:15:42  <McLeopold> you can still get what you need if you calculate your own vision

2011-05-15T20:18:49  <McLeopold> amstan: can you tell me what you did to resolve the jailkeeper issue?
2011-05-15T20:19:05  <amstan> i didn't?
2011-05-15T20:19:13  <qacek> McLeopold: does the engine still send the dead ant lines?
2011-05-15T20:19:21  <McLeopold> qacek: yes
2011-05-15T20:19:28  <qacek> thanks
2011-05-15T20:19:55  <McLeopold> we are going to make a small changed to the vision so a dead ant can still see around it for 1 turn
2011-05-15T20:22:54  <qacek> in that case it doesn't matter if the dead ant is visible by a live ant?
2011-05-15T20:23:27  <McLeopold> a dead ant line is only a dead ant, so you know who died
2011-05-15T20:23:37  <McLeopold> vision is something else entirely
2011-05-15T20:24:09  <McLeopold> although, the vision around a ant, just before it dies, is still sent to you
2011-05-15T20:24:42  <qacek> it seems the bot input wiki might be slightly outdated, but it said that a bot will only receive information about a dead ant if it is visible by a live ant
2011-05-15T20:24:59  <qacek> I assume this is no longer relevant?
2011-05-15T20:25:16  <McLeopold> it isn't relevant, and the wiki is a bit old
2011-05-15T20:25:33  <McLeopold> but we haven't implemented that part of the vision code yet, just know that it is comming
2011-05-15T20:25:43  <qacek> ok
2011-05-15T20:26:08  <McLeopold> amstan: so, I can't remember what the issue was, I'm getting a can't lock jail in my vm
2011-05-15T20:26:27  <McLeopold> I thought we added contest to the jailkeeper group, but he is already there
2011-05-15T20:26:28  <amstan> no, the test bot wasn't working somehow
2011-05-15T20:26:49  <McLeopold> I'm getting the error before that
2011-05-15T20:26:55  <McLeopold> test bot was the next thing
2011-05-15T20:29:24  <amstan> well
2011-05-15T20:29:30  <amstan> we can try it now
2011-05-15T20:29:46  <McLeopold> your system seemed to be down
2011-05-15T20:29:47  * amstan is booting the server
2011-05-15T20:29:59  <amstan> yeah, i don't like keeping it up, it gets hot in there
2011-05-15T20:37:00  <McLeopold> amstan: your server gets farther than mine, you have the jails setup properly
2011-05-15T20:37:17  <McLeopold> amstan: I just can't remember how you got past the lock dir creation issue
2011-05-15T20:37:19  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, the group
2011-05-15T20:37:20  <amstan> we added it
2011-05-15T20:38:26  <McLeopold> But I have the group, and contest is a member?
2011-05-15T20:38:38  <amstan> yes
2011-05-15T20:39:03  <McLeopold> I mean, But I have the group and contest is a member. wtf?
2011-05-15T20:39:20  <McLeopold> jailkeeper:x:1002:contest
2011-05-15T20:39:36  <amstan> yes?
2011-05-15T20:39:44  <amstan> sudo adduser contest jailkeeper
2011-05-15T20:40:14  <McLeopold> already a member
2011-05-15T20:42:22  <amstan> did you restart the shell?
2011-05-15T20:42:29  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-15T20:42:29  <amstan> the group changes don't take effect until you do
2011-05-15T20:43:02  <McLeopold> dang
2011-05-15T20:44:06  <McLeopold> could not change owner on /srv/chroot/jailuser30/scratch
2011-05-15T20:50:08  <McLeopold> amstan: should the jailkeeper be the group for the files inside the jailuser# dir?
2011-05-15T20:50:20  <amstan> i'm not sure
2011-05-15T20:50:24  <amstan> maybe

2011-05-15T21:17:18  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I didn't know we got vision for dead ants?
2011-05-15T21:17:25  <antimatroid> i've  been telling people all this time we don't :\
2011-05-15T21:39:16  <McLeopold> it was an idea that jmcarthur agreed with
2011-05-15T21:39:33  <McLeopold> haven't told sigh yet, but I want to implement it
2011-05-15T21:40:23  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if an ant moves, you should see what it just discovered, even if it dies

2011-05-15T23:27:58  <janzert> in case you read this later and haven't solved your "could not change owner" problem. I would be looking more at the permissions on the jail_own program than the permissions of the jail itself
2011-05-15T23:28:27  <janzert> jail_own is supposed to be owned by root:contest and have its setuid bit set
2011-05-15T23:36:40  <McLeopold> janzert: that was my issue
2011-05-15T23:37:29  <janzert> running a current setup script now to make sure it is still getting set correctly
2011-05-15T23:37:53  <janzert> although from looking at the code it looks like it should be

2011-05-15T23:38:15  <McLeopold> I might be the interaction between a worker *and* server setup
2011-05-15T23:38:42  <McLeopold> but every way I do it, my chown's never stick
2011-05-15T23:39:00  <janzert> ahh, yeah. in particular if the server_setup was run second
2011-05-15T23:39:38  <McLeopold> It would be nice if they didn't clobber each other, so we can run the script again to repair things
2011-05-15T23:39:42  <janzert> I was just thinking about 10 minutes ago about narrowing the chown's done
2011-05-15T23:40:24  <janzert> worker_setup would clobber itself still though
2011-05-15T23:46:38  <McLeopold> janzert: we might need a "clean_jails" function for worker startup
2011-05-15T23:46:58  <janzert> what is it suppose to do?
2011-05-15T23:47:13  <McLeopold> cleanup leftover jail stuff incase of a crash
2011-05-15T23:48:07  <janzert> ahh, yes although it's just an "unlock_jails"
2011-05-15T23:48:38  <janzert> the contents of a jail are purposefully left untouched until the jail is about to be used
2011-05-15T23:49:22  <McLeopold> ok
