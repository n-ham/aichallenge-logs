2011-06-13T00:55:26  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Maybe you can solve blocking with rule like in the Life Game:  if many ants stay near each other for a long time than some of them die.
2011-06-13T00:55:40  <antimatroid> rules should be stateless
2011-06-13T00:55:51  <antimatroid> as in, it should only depend on the current location of ants etc.
2011-06-13T01:01:53  <janzert> I'm thinking we need a radius with both a nib and a convex shoulder (completely unexplained terms I know ;) )
2011-06-13T01:05:58  <janzert> i.e. only the shape in the top middle of this image is immune from blocking by either a diagonal or straight line of ants http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9140666/ant-blocking-shapes.png
2011-06-13T01:06:43  <antimatroid> i like the idea of going back to attack2 = 5
2011-06-13T01:06:49  <antimatroid> i think that makes the blocking harder
2011-06-13T01:06:49  <janzert> I don't know if any actual radius as currently defined fulfills that shape ;)
2011-06-13T01:07:30  <antimatroid> janzert: try the attack2 = 5 radius, you have the first one with knight moves
2011-06-13T01:09:00  * janzert isn't understanding the second half of that sentence
2011-06-13T01:09:21  <antimatroid> the top right image in your link, you have that, plus where a "knight" could move from red in chess
2011-06-13T01:09:50  <antimatroid> or the bottom one without the edges :P
2011-06-13T01:09:54  <antimatroid> corners***
2011-06-13T01:11:14  <janzert> so the top right one without the "nibs" points at the very tip north, east, south and west
2011-06-13T01:12:02  <janzert> the top right already contains the knight moves from chess
2011-06-13T01:12:48  <antimatroid> ah yes
2011-06-13T01:12:54  <antimatroid> that without the n,e,s,w tips
2011-06-13T01:13:10  <janzert> reload the image, should show it in the bottom left now
2011-06-13T01:13:29  <antimatroid> yep, that's what it was previously set at
2011-06-13T01:13:58  <janzert> I think the problem with that shape, is a vertical or horizontal line will block right?
2011-06-13T01:14:14  <antimatroid> don't think so, could be wrong
2011-06-13T01:14:35  <janzert> i.e. you need the nibs to break a straight line and the convex shoulder to break a diagnol
2011-06-13T01:14:38  <antimatroid> oh wait yeah?
2011-06-13T01:14:47  <antimatroid> but the ants can walk onto each other
2011-06-13T01:15:18  <antimatroid> McLeopold: would love to have you chime in on this :P
2011-06-13T01:16:06  <janzert> i.e. when radius2=5 approaches a line of ants at a right angle to the direction of travel it will step into the radius of 3 enemy ants at once
2011-06-13T01:16:36  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-13T01:17:01  <antimatroid> alright, i think i like your top middle one too then
2011-06-13T01:17:09  <janzert> which is where I can to the conclusion about needing both nibs and convex shoulders
2011-06-13T01:17:18  <antimatroid> that is view2 = 9 yeah?
2011-06-13T01:17:27  <antimatroid> attack2*
2011-06-13T01:17:41  <janzert> let me figure it out, not sure if any radius with euclidean distance provides it or not
2011-06-13T01:18:19  <antimatroid> yeah, it's just attack2 = 9
2011-06-13T01:18:24  <janzert> yep
2011-06-13T01:18:49  <janzert> so that is the smallest radius that works out to prevent trivial blocking

2011-06-13T02:02:38  <antimatroid> games go for too long
2011-06-13T02:02:40  <antimatroid> it gets boring :\
2011-06-13T02:02:49  <antimatroid> and there's too many ants
2011-06-13T02:03:45  <janzert> it takes that many ants to end a game with the current skill level of bots, if you reduce the spawn rate it just means the game will take even longer for these bots to eliminate each other
2011-06-13T02:05:14  <janzert> btw, with attack2=9 blocking of 1 and 2 width corridors are still possible of course but it looks like a 3 width gets 3 ants for 2 is the best a static block can do
2011-06-13T02:05:36  <janzert> working out the 4 width now, will post a picture when I'm done :)

2011-06-13T02:07:00  <antimatroid> surely some of the better bots are at least able to search out and attack enemy ants, even if not very strategically
2011-06-13T02:07:30  <antimatroid> i prefer the idea of a game where there are way less ants, because it's more interesting and easier computationally :P
2011-06-13T02:08:27  <janzert> or it just takes longer to get to the density of ants you see now for interesting things to happen

2011-06-13T02:29:29  <janzert> they are a distance 2 rows and cols away

2011-06-13T04:50:23  <Zaphus> can you give me a version that logs what commands it is doing to a file, or the screen or something ?
2011-06-13T04:51:57  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: I saw the conversation yesterday about timeouts, and had a look at the time_remaining function; it turns out that the Sys.time function is wrong, I should be using Unix.gettimeofday. However, this requires an extra argument in ocamlbuild, so I need to update compiler.py first. Just letting you know.
2011-06-13T04:53:01  <UncleVasya> I haven't such a version.
2011-06-13T04:53:02  <UncleVasya> You get error message when you just pressed Start button?

2011-06-13T04:54:16  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: ok
2011-06-13T04:54:17  <antimatroid> i like attack2 = 9
2011-06-13T04:54:31  <antimatroid> as per janzerts analysis
2011-06-13T04:55:02  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  ok, I'll start with the first noticable bug:  If I open it a second time, it is in the Testing tab, and the map and bot lists are blank, I need to flip between the tabs to waken it up
2011-06-13T04:55:40  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  I'm willing to give it a try.   9 means up to 3 squares away in a straight line, right ?  and vision is still way more than that
2011-06-13T04:55:53  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-13T04:56:12  <antimatroid> it makes blocking way harder
2011-06-13T04:56:28  <antimatroid> i don't mind defensive structures, but it's lame if they can't even be broken down with largish corridors
2011-06-13T04:56:45  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: I think there are only few places in my code where your error can happen. I'll add some checks and message explaining where problem is.
2011-06-13T04:56:50  <smiley1983> was the conversation with janzert's analysis earlier today (about to go and read the log)
2011-06-13T04:56:57  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  How hard is it to flip the Beta over to 9 and we give it a try ?

2011-06-13T04:58:03  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  it also makes attacking different, because you can now attack from a larger circumfrance  (thats not how it's spelt!)

2011-06-13T05:03:33  <sir_macelon> so i guess the launch is delayed right? the milestone has passed yesterday
2011-06-13T05:03:46  <janzert> smiley1983: no, I doubt makefiles for submissions of any sort will be added for this contest
2011-06-13T05:03:56  <janzert> at least I've not heard of anyone working on it
2011-06-13T05:04:15  <smiley1983> okay, I should be submitting another pull request later this evening... sorry :|
2011-06-13T05:05:58  <janzert> sir_macelon: my best guess is that time till launch is still measured in weeks not days
2011-06-13T05:07:09  <Zaphus> Perhaps July 1st should be the new target date ?
2011-06-13T05:07:26  <Zaphus> (choosing an arbitrary date thats easy to remember)
2011-06-13T05:07:59  <mleise> HELP! My bot errors out on the test server. It tries to convert 5,346,615,871 to an unsigned int
2011-06-13T05:08:06  <sir_macelon> are you sure the ranking is working right? it's hard to test it with all those java bot crashes
2011-06-13T05:08:25  <sir_macelon> there are too big oscillations and it's hard to detect possible bugs

2011-06-13T05:08:58  <smiley1983> mleise: is that from the player_seed value still being passed into the bot, or something else?
2011-06-13T05:09:09  <sir_macelon> mleise: you have to add proper parsing of the player_seed value
2011-06-13T05:09:20  <Zaphus> sir_macelon: I'd agree... it does make it hard - but the top 4-5 have consistantly been up there in similar order (apart from me tanking my latest version on purpose to test timeouts)
2011-06-13T05:09:35  <mleise> So the seed is a 64 bit int?
2011-06-13T05:09:58  <smiley1983> however, player_seed is scheduled for removal (if I understand correctly)
2011-06-13T05:10:18  <janzert> player_seed is the replacement for the old seed
2011-06-13T05:10:29  <smiley1983> oh, I was wrong, sorry
2011-06-13T05:10:46  <janzert> player_seed is different for each player unlike the old seed parameter was
2011-06-13T05:11:07  <smiley1983> So the bot should actually parse this value and make it available to the player somehow?
2011-06-13T05:11:47  <janzert> if they want, it would mostly be to seed the bots random number generator so it could replay the game the same way later
2011-06-13T05:12:03  <smiley1983> great, that's very useful :)
2011-06-13T05:12:10  <mleise> ok, I simply relied on 32 bit ints as game parameters that was my fault.
2011-06-13T05:12:22  <janzert> or just make your bot deterministic :)
2011-06-13T05:12:36  <smiley1983> mleise: I did too, and I think for all the others it's okay...
2011-06-13T05:14:24  <Zaphus> janzert: Wait, what ?   so you're saying you're going to hand the bots the seed for the random number generator.. plus the code to do the map+food ?   i.e. the bot has all the info to predict where the food and enemies will be ?
2011-06-13T05:14:24  <janzert> hmm, actually it looks like every player is given the same player_seed, it just differs from the engine seed
2011-06-13T05:14:35  <mleise> btw, I changed my nick from my Planet Wars bot name 'Frontier' since I frequent other channels on freenode now :)

2011-06-13T05:14:46  <janzert> Zaphus: no, that was the problem with the seed parameter before
2011-06-13T05:14:55  <antimatroid> what is the seed parameter for?
2011-06-13T05:15:01  <janzert> player_seed is not the same as the engine seed
2011-06-13T05:15:07  <antimatroid> but what's it for?
2011-06-13T05:15:19  <janzert> so players can seed their rng with it I assume
2011-06-13T05:15:28  <janzert> so they can replay the game the same way later on
2011-06-13T05:15:37  <janzert> but not use a fixed seed for every game
2011-06-13T05:15:41  <Zaphus> very odd.. since it wont replay the same because they aren't told the engine seed

2011-06-13T05:15:58  <smiley1983> but it will be the same if the engine uses the same seed it used last time
2011-06-13T05:16:02  <janzert> but the replay has it so you can set the engine to use the same seed
2011-06-13T05:16:24  <janzert> or at least the replay is suppose to record it, I haven't verified that
2011-06-13T05:16:26  <Zaphus> seems far fetched in usefulness, you dont have the other bots either :-)
2011-06-13T05:17:01  <janzert> the other thing you can do is simply reconstruct the input to your bot from the replay

2011-06-13T05:17:16  <janzert> which is the more realistic useful scenario
2011-06-13T05:19:55  <janzert> of course from my experience with arimaa even this is often not enough to get a bot to replay things the same since small differences in processing power and timing will change a moderately complex bot's decision for a move
2011-06-13T05:20:37  <Zaphus> janzert:  You made the image for the attack2=9 blocking, right ?
2011-06-13T05:20:44  <janzert> yes
2011-06-13T05:21:00  <janzert> at least this one http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9140666/ants-r2-9-corridors.png
2011-06-13T05:21:10  <Zaphus> the 1 corridoor case can remove the ant sitting further back, it's not required
2011-06-13T05:21:20  <janzert> true
2011-06-13T05:21:59  <Zaphus> in fact, no matter what the radius is, that combo of two on the end is always going to block a 1-corridoor
2011-06-13T05:22:16  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i worked out how to do a* with multiple sources/targets, just not sure if it will be more efficient than normal bfs
2011-06-13T05:22:21  <Zaphus> apart from being attacked from the side/back obviously, which is where he increased radius really kicks in
2011-06-13T05:22:25  <janzert> yep
2011-06-13T05:22:26  <antimatroid> or more importantly when it will/wont
2011-06-13T05:23:18  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: You're getting error when you press Start or when appliacation starts?

2011-06-13T05:23:39  <Zaphus> UncleVasya: Press start, wait a short time, then the error
2011-06-13T05:23:46  <janzert> we've known for a long time that the current attack method blocks 1 and 2 wide corridors
2011-06-13T05:23:48  <Zaphus> probably the end of the first game they play
2011-06-13T05:24:47  <Zaphus> attackradius2=9 will mean you are more likely to get snipered across the water from the side, which is good.   There will always be some places that can be defended more strongly than others
2011-06-13T05:24:58  <smiley1983> antimatroid: I still haven't worked out exactly what I
2011-06-13T05:25:16  <smiley1983> 'll be doing for pathfinding, but I'm pretty sure it will be based on bfs
2011-06-13T05:25:18  <janzert> what didn't become apparent until the last few days was that for many radius settings almost any width corridor could be blocked
2011-06-13T05:27:39  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i was intending to just use bfs, but same paper examples last night convinced me otherwise i think
2011-06-13T05:30:40  <smiley1983> I'd be curious to know what the examples illustrated :)
2011-06-13T05:30:43  <janzert> you could simply store a complete distance map, it's less than 270MB for a 128*128 map ;)
2011-06-13T05:30:45  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/pJ95bqfC
2011-06-13T05:30:53  <antimatroid> it's hard to do example illistrations
2011-06-13T05:31:47  <antimatroid> g(x) := distance from a to x, h(x) := min dist(x, *) for all *, f := g + h
2011-06-13T05:32:25  <antimatroid> i think i'd be inclined to order my queue of searchable squares by min f, then min h for a draw
2011-06-13T05:33:03  <antimatroid> the calculation of h is what might make it less efficient than normal bfs, depending on number of targets
2011-06-13T05:33:16  <antimatroid> and to some degree the number of sources
2011-06-13T05:33:56  <janzert> actually if you store the distances in nibbles, you can fit a 200x200 map in ~800MB
2011-06-13T05:34:18  <antimatroid> i thought that was to me :P
2011-06-13T05:34:28  <antimatroid> i was like where the hell am i going to get 800mb of memory
2011-06-13T05:34:41  <antimatroid> for a part of my bots move making :P
2011-06-13T05:35:01  <Zaphus> janzert:  halve that, because the distance from A-B is the same as B-A
2011-06-13T05:35:04  <janzert> I'm being rather facetious but it was to you :)
2011-06-13T05:35:19  <janzert> Zaphus: ahh, yes
2011-06-13T05:35:35  <antimatroid> you calculate h once you come across a square, and you can just traverse the target set to find the min distance
2011-06-13T05:35:36  <janzert> so you're down to 400MB less than half of your bots limit :P
2011-06-13T05:35:50  <Zaphus> and, you dont need to include the ones that start or end in water, that will save some too :-)
2011-06-13T05:36:19  <antimatroid> you don't calculate h for all locations before the search, as you might not search all locations, so why bother?
2011-06-13T05:36:20  <janzert> well, then you need a more complex representation and probably can't do a simple table lookup to get your distances
2011-06-13T05:36:20  <smiley1983> antimatroid: that makes sense. I think I'm going to be wanting to use bfs for other reasons anyway, and it will incidentally cover most of the pathfinding I need - but it might be useful to implement A* for some special cases
2011-06-13T05:36:46  <antimatroid> no, that's my point, h could be expensive, there's some trade off to when bfs would actually be better i think
2011-06-13T05:37:03  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i want to speed food collection up
2011-06-13T05:37:14  <antimatroid> and "matching up" my ants to enemy ants
2011-06-13T05:37:52  <antimatroid> i want to maximise teh time i have for working out battle moves basically :P
2011-06-13T05:38:45  <smiley1983> I'm still deciding about whether I can cover food and enemy matching with one search, or if I need two (or more) separate searches.
2011-06-13T05:39:00  <antimatroid> meh, i want to collect food first
2011-06-13T05:39:12  <antimatroid> otherwise just make your target set the food/enemies
2011-06-13T05:39:43  <antimatroid> it's a bit more complicated once you add in reusing already moved/future ants, but it still works
2011-06-13T05:40:01  <smiley1983> I'm curious; if 3 of 4 bots return their orders within 100ms, does the 4th bot get more processing time than it would have if the other three had used 900ms?
2011-06-13T05:40:16  <antimatroid> previously yes
2011-06-13T05:40:18  <antimatroid> currently yes
2011-06-13T05:40:29  <antimatroid> on the proper server once we launch, no
2011-06-13T05:40:49  <janzert> antimatroid: for that exact scenario it would still be yes ;)
2011-06-13T05:41:03  <janzert> well, slightly possibly yes
2011-06-13T05:41:09  <smiley1983> I thought so :) My planetwars bot was very fast, I think it would never have used more than 300ms on the maps in that contest.
2011-06-13T05:41:15  <antimatroid> janzert: aren't we going to be pausing the processes of bots while others make their moves?
2011-06-13T05:41:35  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i used > 0.9 seconds every turn :P
2011-06-13T05:41:38  <janzert> we'll be running one bot per core on the machine
2011-06-13T05:41:39  <smiley1983> they are multi-core machines...
2011-06-13T05:42:02  <Zaphus> how many cores ?
2011-06-13T05:42:06  <antimatroid> 2
2011-06-13T05:42:07  <janzert> so while much better, there will still be a bit of 'interference'
2011-06-13T05:42:15  <antimatroid> okay sure
2011-06-13T05:42:18  <janzert> Zaphus: probably 2, maybe 8
2011-06-13T05:42:19  <antimatroid> i'm still much happier
2011-06-13T05:42:28  <Zaphus> barely 'mult-core' at 2 :-)
2011-06-13T05:43:00  <Zaphus> so a 10-bot map will have some cores with 1 bot and some with 2,  hope I get lucky!
2011-06-13T05:43:29  <janzert> ? it will have 5 pairs of two to start with
2011-06-13T05:43:41  <janzert> the pairs are shuffled on each move
2011-06-13T05:43:57  <smiley1983> that is a good feature :)
2011-06-13T05:43:59  <Zaphus> oh, so it wont go 4 pairs of 2 and 4 singles
2011-06-13T05:44:27  <janzert> no
2011-06-13T05:44:42  <antimatroid> smiley1983: http://pastebin.com/6Dh9Jdxg i think that's the order of searching squares
2011-06-13T05:44:56  <antimatroid> note the .'s adjacent to numbers are in the search queue
2011-06-13T05:45:37  <antimatroid> that's the order of squares being pulled off the search queue ***
2011-06-13T05:45:38  <Zaphus> antimatroid: what happened to #3 ?
2011-06-13T05:45:43  <antimatroid> i did 2 twice
2011-06-13T05:45:47  <antimatroid> because it was a draw
2011-06-13T05:45:47  <janzert> of not though, the correct pairing and dispatching isn't quite completely implemented yet
2011-06-13T05:45:52  <Zaphus> ah
2011-06-13T05:46:01  <janzert> and not in use on the beta server at all
2011-06-13T05:47:22  <janzert> current code will continue to schedule all bots throughout the game even after they've been eliminated so as the game goes on the likelihood is the remaining bots will be paired with a bot that is eliminated and won't actually be run for the time slot
2011-06-13T05:47:52  <Zaphus> should there be some beta testing on the real server (once it's close to launch time)?   given that it's going to have different behaviour/code ?
2011-06-13T05:48:02  <janzert> the engine code around this part is really icky right now and I'm slowly refactoring it to be nicer :)
2011-06-13T05:48:20  <antimatroid> Zaphus: there's a point where you've gotta just go for it and clean up any necessities
2011-06-13T05:48:24  <janzert> Zaphus: I agree or at least the beta server needs to slowly change to match the real settings
2011-06-13T05:48:44  * antimatroid shuts up
2011-06-13T05:48:48  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  Yes, but that point should be after you've tried at least once to see if it works !
2011-06-13T05:48:55  <antimatroid> janzert is much more knowledgeable about this stuff :P
2011-06-13T05:49:00  <janzert> btw, current game settings are completely unworkable from a resource use point of view
2011-06-13T05:49:13  <antimatroid> ?
2011-06-13T05:49:20  <smiley1983> yes, I thought the 2000 turn games, while nice, were not sustainable
2011-06-13T05:49:29  <antimatroid> oh resource constraints?
2011-06-13T05:49:33  <janzert> right
2011-06-13T05:49:35  <antimatroid> yeah, i want less food and shorter games
2011-06-13T05:49:38  <antimatroid> possibly smaller maps
2011-06-13T05:49:52  <antimatroid> i like the idea of ants getting to somewhat choose where in the map their battles take place
2011-06-13T05:49:59  <janzert> less food means the natural game length is longer though :P
2011-06-13T05:50:06  <antimatroid> not necessarily
2011-06-13T05:50:17  <janzert> in almost all cases I've seen
2011-06-13T05:50:18  <antimatroid> lots of bots continually growing takes ages
2011-06-13T05:50:39  <antimatroid> i haven't seen any games with way less food?
2011-06-13T05:50:49  <Zaphus>   2000 turns x 10 bots x 1000ms each means up to 5.5 CPU hours per game  (if I did that math correctly)
2011-06-13T05:51:32  <antimatroid> so how do we make the games go for less time?
2011-06-13T05:51:38  <antimatroid> reduce the map size? is that it?
2011-06-13T05:51:49  <janzert> I'm hoping max turns can go way down
2011-06-13T05:51:58  <antimatroid> we want the number of turns to allow for games to reasonably play out
2011-06-13T05:52:01  <janzert> it seems like it can from looking at games with better bots
2011-06-13T05:52:01  <Zaphus> no, if you let people have 1000 ms for 2000 turns, they can take that long on a 3x3 map if they want
2011-06-13T05:52:06  <janzert> antimatroid: right
2011-06-13T05:52:26  <Zaphus> (was answering the map size question)
2011-06-13T05:52:28  <antimatroid> Zaphus: the point is to make it so that max turns can reasonably be reduced
2011-06-13T05:52:32  <janzert> but most of the good bots seem to often wrap things up in less than 1000 turns
2011-06-13T05:52:40  <antimatroid> does a smaller map size allow the game to play out faster?
2011-06-13T05:52:46  <antimatroid> if the amount of food doesn't
2011-06-13T05:52:47  <janzert> someone needs to really make a few histograms from the beta server games
2011-06-13T05:52:59  <antimatroid> a1k0n_ : i believe you have been summoned!
2011-06-13T05:53:05  <janzert> yeah, smaller bots would generally shorten game length as well
2011-06-13T05:53:09  <janzert> smaller maps rather
2011-06-13T05:53:11  <janzert> :)
2011-06-13T05:53:15  <Zaphus> janzert: agreed, are there different map sizes on the Beta ?
2011-06-13T05:53:44  <Zaphus> the ones I have seen seem to range from 80x100 to 110x120 or something like that
2011-06-13T05:54:03  <janzert> a histogram showing the game lengths and a histogram showing the move number that all bots would have finished in their actual final rankings from the beta server games would be really nice
2011-06-13T05:54:21  <janzert> I'm not sure what the map size range is on beta
2011-06-13T05:54:26  <antimatroid> alright, things to do 1. change attack2 to 9, 2. add more variety in the map sizes, 3. add more variety in the amount of food spawned?
2011-06-13T05:54:39  <antimatroid> i'm guessing it's like 80-120 dimensions?
2011-06-13T05:54:47  <antimatroid> that rings a bell as the dimensions i used with the example map gen
2011-06-13T05:55:29  <janzert> food spawn settings really should change to be relative to number of players or map area instead of the absolute range it is now
2011-06-13T05:55:46  <antimatroid> agreed
2011-06-13T05:55:49  <Zaphus> 60*60 has 1/3 the squares of 100*100 - might be worth making some down that direction (even down to 40x40 for craziness)
2011-06-13T05:55:54  <antimatroid> mcleopold made some new function for spawning the other week
2011-06-13T05:56:24  <antimatroid> anyway, i should get back to my exam :P
2011-06-13T05:57:07  <Zaphus> there will always be the case where two similar bots get half the map each (regardless of size) and the lead flip-flops about, they'll always want more turns
2011-06-13T05:57:52  <janzert> yep, but in that case of course it basically doesn't matter what the actual length is
2011-06-13T05:58:04  <antimatroid> hence the existence of max turns
2011-06-13T05:58:40  <janzert> that's where a histogram of move the final ranking is achieved on would be great, so we can see what the max move could be cut down to without effecting outcomes too often
2011-06-13T05:58:42  <Zaphus> janzert: agreed.  just settle on the max before things start, or have variable max - dont have live server running at 2000 and then changing to 500 for the finals (or vice versa)
2011-06-13T05:58:58  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: you're the graphs man if i recall correctly :P
2011-06-13T05:59:08  <janzert> the settings definitely have to stay the same for the finals
2011-06-13T05:59:19  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-13T05:59:36  <janzert> and we'll here endless complaining if they change much into the actual contest too
2011-06-13T05:59:36  <antimatroid> we need to be clear as to what they are too
2011-06-13T05:59:46  <Zaphus> do what you like to the poor Beta bots though, thats their job :-)
2011-06-13T05:59:48  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-13T06:01:45  <Zaphus> if you are looking at the graphs, - maybe just graphs with at least 2 from the top end of the table ?  assume that thats where the issues will arise (or at least the major arguments!)  possibly ignore matches with several bots crashing too
2011-06-13T06:02:49  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: maybe there are some changes in the replay-file format.  I can't imagine another cause of the problem.
2011-06-13T06:03:10  <Zaphus> FYI - my testing which is running right now (doing hundreds of games) is set to 1000 turns, and almost never has a result between my various bots, the lead is often less than 10% (i.e. 20 when their score is 200, 80 when it is 800)   then again, they are all very similar
2011-06-13T06:03:26  <smiley1983> I think actually it would be great to add a small variable to the number of turns between games - just 5 or 10, so that people don't get the idea that they can hardcode the defaults at the time
2011-06-13T06:03:42  <Zaphus> UncleVasya: want me to zip up my environment and send it ?  it should be self contained
2011-06-13T06:03:43  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: Here is version wich may show message to you about problem's place: http://www.filefactory.com/file/ccc9178/n/AntsTesting_0.3_RC_2_testing.7z
2011-06-13T06:06:07  <Zaphus> smiley1983:  there were arguments in PW that people would code for the end of the game, and for some reason that was regarded as bad.  if you supply the number of turns to the bot (which we do) then some people will code for it.   endgame, so be it
2011-06-13T06:06:53  <antimatroid> i wont games in planet wars because my bot knew when the game would end
2011-06-13T06:06:55  <smiley1983> Oh, I'm entirely in support of bots knowing that the game will end
2011-06-13T06:07:08  <antimatroid> the other bot would claim a neutral when it wouldn't payoff in a close match, and i would win
2011-06-13T06:07:17  <smiley1983> What happened last time, though, was that some people hardcoded the "fact" that there were 28 planets
2011-06-13T06:07:24  <smiley1983> or 29, or whatever the number was
2011-06-13T06:07:41  <janzert> in PW I think the problem was that we didn't give the bot a way to know the max turn limit so people had to assume it would stay the same
2011-06-13T06:07:47  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  "Retrieving places info:                   "

2011-06-13T06:09:29  <Zaphus> Do we pass in the total number of players in the init info to the bots, or do they have to get lucky and find them all (or the highest numbered one) ?
2011-06-13T06:09:50  <smiley1983> they aren't told, and bot numbers are set in the order you encounter them
2011-06-13T06:10:10  <smiley1983> so the first enemy you encounter is always player 1
2011-06-13T06:10:26  <Zaphus> interesting

2011-06-13T06:10:38  <carlop> Zaphus: the bot should reverse the map generator from the column/row pair....
2011-06-13T06:10:54  <Zaphus> so you never really know how many (until you can see every square simultaneously)
2011-06-13T06:11:20  <janzert> so just came across a different distance metric, "octagonal distance" it seems to be a combination of chebyshev and manhattan distance
2011-06-13T06:11:35  <Zaphus> carlop:  thats a big assumption :-)
2011-06-13T06:12:10  <carlop> no, I think that if you see an enemy ant his team is numbered 1, the you see another enemy ant and his team numbered 2

2011-06-13T06:14:49  <carlop> I think that the map generator can be a problem, cause I can be able to know information for square out of sight, but this is another problem, I don't think i'm going to do assumption, but on later stage can be a good thing
2011-06-13T06:15:38  <Zaphus> carlop:  match the water pattern to a known map, load your "best settings for this map" values.  it could be a smart move
2011-06-13T06:15:48  <antimatroid> carlop: we're going to add more symmetries
2011-06-13T06:16:05  <antimatroid> and you don't necessarily know row and column translate or the number of players at the start of the game
2011-06-13T06:16:35  <Zaphus> I had rules like that for my PW bot,  not exact matches but "if we both start within X moves of each other, use totally different heuristics to a normal game"  (same for really really far apart)
2011-06-13T06:19:58  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-4d01447a.pool.mediaWays.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-13T06:20:29  <carlop> i think more something like: "hey, this map has rotational symmetry (given the square that i can see), so maybe i can assume that is likely that the whole map have rotational symmetry, so I can made some tactical decision (better go with my army there) without having information"
2011-06-13T06:21:10  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!kvirc@31.144.176.30> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-13T06:24:03  <Zaphus> carlop:  well, everyone has that info, so at least it's fair.   we all know the exact attack radius as well, but only some will properly use that to their advantage
2011-06-13T06:24:16  <smiley1983> Does anyone know if player_seed is guaranteed to be a 64-bit integer, or is it just an int which is sometimes on a 64-bit system?
2011-06-13T06:24:20  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: I have one replay from the site and it has another format. If this is the only problem than app should work if you download a tools.zip. Can you chek it please?
2011-06-13T06:24:34  <janzert> smiley1983: I would assume the latter
2011-06-13T06:25:03  <smiley1983> great, thanks
2011-06-13T06:25:21  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  ok, I'll have to set up another set of directories - tools.zip is out of date and should be updated in the near future to map to the Beta servers data
2011-06-13T06:25:25  <janzert> actually I'm rather positive it is currently the latter
2011-06-13T06:29:21  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: I'm going to work on the correct replay processing so app will be able to retrieve info from different replay formats.

2011-06-13T06:35:27  <stocha> janzert: nice of you to have found rad2=9  let's put the info somewhere people can see it. So people will be able to proofread your conclusions.
2011-06-13T06:36:33  <stocha> Also you guys should activate the strong java bots, so we can look at some real games. if you don't like getting bored :p
2011-06-13T06:36:35  <janzert> feel free ;)
2011-06-13T06:37:03  <Zaphus> what strong java bots ?
2011-06-13T06:37:06  <stocha> i though you could put it in the message up there in the irc channel ? and then also the forum. Could be still someone read it.
2011-06-13T06:37:19  <stocha> there are four or five java bot that seem acceptable
2011-06-13T06:37:27  <stocha> i didn't dig to much into it though.
2011-06-13T06:37:45  <stocha> but i think currently they would provide some good opponents.
2011-06-13T06:38:00  <Zaphus> where are they ?
2011-06-13T06:38:33  <stocha> stocha is not there anymore for sure. i didn't find any use to have it there, when it just go "jvm no loaded" about 70% of the games :p
2011-06-13T06:39:10  <stocha> i don't know for the other, let's say sir_macelon and greentea
2011-06-13T06:39:41  <stocha> and parsley
2011-06-13T06:39:42  <janzert> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/language_profile.php?language=Java
2011-06-13T06:39:50  <janzert> they're playing
2011-06-13T06:40:23  <stocha> so let's assume stocha, sir_macelon, parsley, greentea are good bots.
2011-06-13T06:40:28  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: ok, I'll go to my relatives soon and there I'll be able to download ants from github.
2011-06-13T06:40:50  <Zaphus> ah, yes - they are good bots, if they get to play :-)
2011-06-13T06:40:59  <stocha> java bots i mean. there may be other, using vm, i didn't dig too much into it.
2011-06-13T06:41:35  <Zaphus> they are still crashing out, heres one from a couple of hours ago:   http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=22419&user=21
2011-06-13T06:42:02  <stocha> i know for sure stocha has nasty bug. but i don't feel like i'll fix them when i can't see it play :p
2011-06-13T06:42:48  <stocha> Zaphus: is the jvm load crashing supposed to be cared for yet ?
2011-06-13T06:43:14  <janzert> the jvm crashing won't change until the beta server is changed
2011-06-13T06:43:28  <janzert> most likely anyway
2011-06-13T06:44:02  <stocha> it would suffice to put in a normal jvm, that can launch with -Xmx=100m
2011-06-13T06:44:07  <stocha> -Xmx100m
2011-06-13T06:44:25  <janzert> that is already done
2011-06-13T06:44:29  <janzert> didn't fix it
2011-06-13T06:44:45  <stocha> they are loaded with 100m and still crash ? damn
2011-06-13T06:45:06  <janzert> actually I believe it is 500 but yes
2011-06-13T06:45:15  <stocha> 500 is too much then
2011-06-13T06:45:17  <janzert> 100 was tried as well I believe
2011-06-13T06:45:19  <stocha> try with 100.
2011-06-13T06:45:22  <stocha> okay.
2011-06-13T06:45:31  <stocha> forbid jvm based bots then :
2011-06-13T06:45:51  <stocha> so at least we can look at the ranking system. if some bot are left after that :p
2011-06-13T06:46:07  <janzert> might as well let them play what they can if people want to play around with them, there will always be bots that crash randomly
2011-06-13T06:46:19  <stocha> unless you want to see how the ranking goes with wild bot with vastly varying strength
2011-06-13T06:46:31  <Zaphus> thats pretty insane.  I know nothing about JVM, but they can't manage to run in 500mb ?!

2011-06-13T06:46:48  <stocha> Zaphus: they can.
2011-06-13T06:46:51  <janzert> Zaphus: or less than about 15 threads
2011-06-13T06:47:07  <stocha> janzert: console mode shouldn't have many threads
2011-06-13T06:47:11  <Zaphus> can java be compiled or something, to not require the jvm ?
2011-06-13T06:47:17  <janzert> stocha: it does though
2011-06-13T06:47:31  <stocha> it can be compiled once it is in bytecode form
2011-06-13T06:47:40  <stocha> i've seen it done with comercial programes at least.
2011-06-13T06:48:00  <janzert> gcj can be used to compile it but has lots of problems from what I understand
2011-06-13T06:48:19  <stocha> (bytecode is a compile form, that can execute pretty fast with just in time native compilation of the bytecode)
2011-06-13T06:48:19  <Zaphus> how did it work on PW ?  truckloads more resources ?
2011-06-13T06:48:33  <janzert> stocha: yes, that is what the jvm runs
2011-06-13T06:48:34  <stocha> it was 2 player
2011-06-13T06:48:42  <stocha> there they are trying with 10 players.
2011-06-13T06:48:50  <janzert> Zaphus: yes, the ec2 servers have much more ram available
2011-06-13T06:49:23  <Zaphus> of course, 10 players...  that compounds it (if there happens to be a lot of java ones)
2011-06-13T06:49:24  <stocha> 10 players need 5 time more ressources. not to mention that ant is a quite bigger game than pw was.
2011-06-13T06:49:33  <janzert> and yes for PW it didn't have as many players at once, although still 8 per server
2011-06-13T06:49:52  <janzert> or rather it was 4 I guess
2011-06-13T06:50:40  <stocha> i'm trying to port buggy stocha to a c version. but i'm quite lazy lately. it goes very slow. (it did made me find some very severe bugs though :p)

2011-06-13T06:51:16  <stocha> c seems so dangerous with silent write overflow looming at making your life miserable
2011-06-13T06:52:05  <Zaphus> yep, C is riding a motorbike without a helmet.   Java is more like you are wrapped in bubble wrap, can barely move but you are safe :-)    of course I'm biased :-)
2011-06-13T06:52:56  <stocha> i like java for two things : write overflow safety. And then they have a huge ubiquitous standard library.
2011-06-13T06:53:10  <stocha> i think write overflow safety is paramount though.
2011-06-13T06:54:01  <stocha> in c, depending where you compile your stuff, you might have or not have write overflow. think of *int for example.
2011-06-13T06:54:03  <Zaphus> yes, it is pretty good.   of course I just write code not to do write overflows myself, and have compilers that put checks into the code as well
2011-06-13T06:54:56  <stocha> my nightmare is writing into a *int only to silently overflow it because of 32bits 64bits confusion.
2011-06-13T06:55:00  <stocha> C is lame.
2011-06-13T06:55:52  <Zaphus> yeah, that will get you...  32 v 64 v 128   does Java define each of those ints seperately ?
2011-06-13T06:56:10  <stocha> yeah java has fixed sizes.
2011-06-13T06:56:12  <janzert> if you're overflowing a pointer because of 32/64 bit confusion there are probably larger issues
2011-06-13T06:56:19  <stocha> there are drawback to it.
2011-06-13T06:56:40  <stocha> some silly guys said a int[] could only have 2^32 elements.
2011-06-13T06:56:59  <stocha> it will make life miserable in twenty years :p
2011-06-13T06:57:25  <stocha> unless mankind bomb/overheat itself to death before that.
2011-06-13T06:57:27  <Zaphus> of course in C a quick  sizeof(int) test in your code will alert you to if you are on different hardware/env.  and there are __int64 and __int128 keywords on most platforms
2011-06-13T06:57:54  <stocha> Zaphus: "most platform"
2011-06-13T06:58:09  <stocha> then you have to add a #include too ?
2011-06-13T06:58:14  <stocha> different for each platform ?
2011-06-13T06:58:44  <stocha> you need a whole library only to have an idea with operand size you are using :p
2011-06-13T06:58:50  <Zaphus> I'm older than C, so I'm stuck in my ways  (I do write some java, it's just too fiddly to get simple code up and running)
2011-06-13T06:59:06  <stocha> fiddly ?
2011-06-13T06:59:25  <stocha> i don't now the english meaning of it
2011-06-13T06:59:30  <stocha> what's fiddly ?
2011-06-13T06:59:38  <stocha> i find java very good for quick prototyping.
2011-06-13T06:59:38  <Zaphus> i.e. I don't know it as well as I know C, so anything I forget is annoying even if it's small...
2011-06-13T06:59:57  <stocha> mm. java is pretty friendly to c users.
2011-06-13T07:00:06  <stocha> especially with a ice ide :p
2011-06-13T07:00:09  <Zaphus> fiddly == "small and awkward to do or handle"
2011-06-13T07:00:12  <stocha> but maybe you don't need ide.
2011-06-13T07:00:27  <janzert> btw, sizeof is actually an unary operator in C. no library involved :)
2011-06-13T07:00:31  <stocha> ide are maybe the biggest revolution in 50 years of programming.
2011-06-13T07:00:44  <stocha> sizeof is standard yes :)
2011-06-13T07:00:48  <Zaphus> Oh, I need an IDE !   I just hate eclipse with a passion, which is a problem when I do Android/Java code :-)
2011-06-13T07:01:10  <stocha> try to write something for iphone then.
2011-06-13T07:01:23  <stocha> apple is a developer nightmare i think.
2011-06-13T07:01:53  <stocha> i bought a macbook, in order to toy with iphone/ipad. i don't want to by an apple any more in my *** life
2011-06-13T07:01:54  <Zaphus> Nothing compared to Sony,   PS2/PS3 were nightmares to work on (at least initially)
2011-06-13T07:02:11  <stocha> i doubt it's nastyer than macos
2011-06-13T07:02:20  <stocha> in macos : 1/ keyboard is wrong
2011-06-13T07:02:46  <stocha> 2/ all you usual keybinding are already used by the system, for useless junk functions.
2011-06-13T07:02:59  <stocha> 3/ all binding will use other keys.

2011-06-13T07:03:56  <stocha> 6/ i stoped there, but it's enough for me
2011-06-13T07:04:05  <stocha> 7/ everything need to by paid for
2011-06-13T07:04:51  <stocha> for example, you pay your iphone. you need a mac for writing application to it. Their developpement environnement is not free anymore. When you want to install your program into iphone, you have to pay a annual fee for that also.
2011-06-13T07:04:56  <stocha> it's really madness.
2011-06-13T07:05:18  <stocha> in 10 years, apple will not exists anymore.

2011-06-13T07:06:09  <stocha> if they loose customers as efficiently they lost me :p  But maybe only people who write code will hate them hard.
2011-06-13T07:06:59  <stocha> I built an archive .zip with standard mac stuff. it would add an unasked directory that would make compilation on the test server failed
2011-06-13T07:07:19  <stocha> i had to go with the jar maker utility in order to provide a clean zip. madness i tell you.
2011-06-13T07:07:50  <george1914> stocha:  hi, so how has your c experimentation gone?
2011-06-13T07:08:12  <george1914> sounds like you should have followed my advice and gone with c++?
2011-06-13T07:08:19  <stocha> george1914: i spent a whole day trying to build a shared lib, for linking with my java ant tester.
2011-06-13T07:08:40  <stocha> george1914: i'm quite lazy lately also :p
2011-06-13T07:09:07  <stocha> george1914: so far i found two killer bug. so in some way it's going well. (the bug are inside the java version)
2011-06-13T07:09:24  <george1914> ah well, hopefully you learned some stuff ...
2011-06-13T07:09:53  <stocha> i guess if stocha bot plays on a 65 width or 129 width, it will suddenly drop serverly in strength :p
2011-06-13T07:10:18  <stocha> george1914: i have still quite some work. and am worrying like hell about write overflows
2011-06-13T07:10:20  <george1914> i agree with you about not liking using apple for coding ...  but for sure the company will keep doing well ...
2011-06-13T07:10:54  <stocha> george1914: i'm not conviced. look what happened to internet explorer. and it was not as broken as apple is for developpers.
2011-06-13T07:11:30  <stocha> arguably ie still have some market share. but it doesn't look to good from the perspective of having had 99% :)
2011-06-13T07:11:55  <george1914> well, we will see...   but it will take longer for me to say 'i told you so...' in this case  :)        (though i'd like to be wrong)
2011-06-13T07:12:04  <stocha> then apple has the steve job problem. if the guy dies, what will become of the thing ?
2011-06-13T07:12:48  <stocha> maybe 10 years is a bit optimistic for it to disapear. especially since it's one of the powefullest hightech brand right now.
2011-06-13T07:13:21  <stocha> but i don't want to by any share. steve jobs dies, you loose half your money in less than a week.
2011-06-13T07:13:43  <stocha> then it will continually drop possibly to 0.01 dollars.
2011-06-13T07:14:04  <stocha> unless the christ himself become ceo or something.$
2011-06-13T07:14:45  <stocha> it's fully headed at short term.
2011-06-13T07:14:56  <george1914> anyway, back to ants ...             i was about to write some 'combat' code,  but it seems the fight-radius will change?
2011-06-13T07:15:08  <stocha> it will go to 9 it seems.
2011-06-13T07:15:16  <george1914> hm
2011-06-13T07:15:22  <stocha> radius2=9
2011-06-13T07:15:28  <stocha> so radius = 3 i guess.
2011-06-13T07:15:47  <george1914> i think i will get better results from hardcoding for a certain range, than trying to be ok-ish at any range
2011-06-13T07:16:36  <stocha> george1914: same goes for me
2011-06-13T07:17:02  <stocha> george1914: i want most probably to spot/build some premade (possibly handmade) patterns.
2011-06-13T07:17:18  <stocha> if i'm not lazy as to skip combat all together :p
2011-06-13T07:17:36  <stocha> first thing would be to see how my old stocha greedy bot do.
2011-06-13T07:18:16  <stocha> then i would have to remake most tests i did, when i'll have corected the deadly bugs. (wich i can't do, because i ran out of found for my hosting server :p )
2011-06-13T07:18:21  <george1914> well, i will always have some 'free parameters'  for eg when to enact combat function - i cant hope to optimise for several ranges simultaneously ...
2011-06-13T07:19:08  <stocha> george1914: i always advocated for everything to bet set in stone when the game launch. And then for any freedom to be fully present in real cases
2011-06-13T07:19:43  <george1914> well, it is good to be clear what the rules are at the start of competition ...
2011-06-13T07:19:43  <stocha> for example, let's say there is a maximum of 4000 ants per player. Then constests will HAVE to provide situations where it happens that some players have 4000 ants.
2011-06-13T07:20:07  <george1914> but i guess they want/need tyo be able to change small things if they find changes are needed
2011-06-13T07:20:11  <stocha> and i want the map generation rules to be final when contest start also.
2011-06-13T07:20:20  <Zaphus> I want to see what happens on a totally blank map (or one that is an 'arena' - all the four walls are water)
2011-06-13T07:20:30  <stocha> then there is the beta test for twinking small values.
2011-06-13T07:20:51  <stocha> Zaphus: i think they accept map generators right now.
2011-06-13T07:21:03  <george1914> Zaphus: i think that in arena, you really want to start in a corner - fewer enemies ...
2011-06-13T07:21:28  <stocha> george1914: what about a round arena ?
2011-06-13T07:21:30  <george1914> and in general, you want to start next to weaker enemies, and your main opponents to start next to each other ....
2011-06-13T07:21:40  <Zaphus> stocha: problem with changing the rules during the live version is it is unfair on those people who don't find out about the rule change, or do not update after the rule change.  a bot submitted on day 1 should be capable of competing in the finals (if coded well)
2011-06-13T07:21:46  <george1914> round?  still on the edge is best
2011-06-13T07:22:14  <stocha> Zaphus: i agree with that.
2011-06-13T07:22:22  <george1914> me too -
2011-06-13T07:22:48  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!5c707e0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.92.112.126.14> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-13T07:22:49  <stocha> george1914: you can make them all spawned on edge, then. you can have quite efficent radial symetry also :p
2011-06-13T07:22:56  <stocha> even with a bit of water.
2011-06-13T07:23:04  <george1914> but i think the organisers are busy, and will be needed to test/change small things during the competition - not ideal, but i imagine it will happen a little?
2011-06-13T07:23:19  <george1914> stocha: i guess so
2011-06-13T07:23:54  <stocha> george1914: organisers are simply absent. But there a beta period. It should settle everything from my point of view. So it has to go for a while if needed.
2011-06-13T07:24:27  <stocha> some people like antimatroid, janzert, etc are mandated to make decisions.
2011-06-13T07:24:40  <stocha> but they are not organizers i think.
2011-06-13T07:24:56  <antimatroid> george1914: i think you mean my advice!
2011-06-13T07:25:00  <stocha> they will participate.
2011-06-13T07:25:55  <stocha> a lot of people like me have strong feeling about the game, but don't want to participate beside the chat :p
2011-06-13T07:25:56  <antimatroid> :p
2011-06-13T07:26:05  <stocha> it's too much arguing.
2011-06-13T07:26:18  <george1914> anyway, just want to ask yours opinions on my opinion .... :   i think that once competition starts, and good bots are written, the game will become like this ... :  people will have fronts, and framland in their safe areas.    then there will be fighting just on the 'front' regions
2011-06-13T07:26:25  <antimatroid> i don't understand why people dislike arguments so much
2011-06-13T07:26:29  <george1914> and then it will become strategic game theory ...
2011-06-13T07:26:40  <george1914> do i target the weakest of my neightbours?
2011-06-13T07:26:55  <george1914> (i dont want to fight the same against all neighbours - would just weaken me)
2011-06-13T07:27:06  <stocha> my hope is : once there will be strong bots, they will astonish everyone.
2011-06-13T07:27:06  <antimatroid> george1914: I would go for the weaker neighbours first
2011-06-13T07:27:12  <george1914> do i just sit, and let the others weaken each other?
2011-06-13T07:27:17  <antimatroid> and that
2011-06-13T07:27:23  <antimatroid> but that's a balancing act
2011-06-13T07:27:43  <antimatroid> george1914: what do you think about attack2 = 9?
2011-06-13T07:27:49  <george1914> the game might well change from an   'exploring ant' game    into a diplomacy/strategic game
2011-06-13T07:27:50  <stocha> george1914: i think you are right for some map settings. But depending on maps, things will differs.
2011-06-13T07:28:14  <george1914> as long as i face more than 1 enemy, i think it will probably come up
2011-06-13T07:28:30  <george1914> antimatroid:  9?  i am just drawing a grid...
2011-06-13T07:28:36  <george1914> looks interesting
2011-06-13T07:28:40  <stocha> there computer ressources of bots are very limited. I will bet for all agressive bot to be the most stable strategy overall.
2011-06-13T07:28:48  <george1914> i guess you did it to remove blocking?
2011-06-13T07:28:57  <antimatroid> it doesn't remove blocking
2011-06-13T07:28:59  <antimatroid> makes it harder though
2011-06-13T07:29:06  <george1914> does it allow for cleverer tactics in multiant combat as well?  i hope so
2011-06-13T07:29:16  <antimatroid> i think it makes fighting more strategic
2011-06-13T07:29:16  <stocha> it renders blocking acceptable (back to 2-width corridor block)
2011-06-13T07:29:21  <antimatroid> as more ants can end up in the same battle
2011-06-13T07:29:21  <george1914> i guess it will be an improvement
2011-06-13T07:29:42  <antimatroid> it makes evaluating states more expensive though
2011-06-13T07:30:01  <george1914> sounds good - you guys seem to make good choices (eg on the games etc)  so i would anyway believe you that it improves it  :)
2011-06-13T07:30:16  <antimatroid> we're only really guessing that it improves anything
2011-06-13T07:30:30  <antimatroid> but yeah, generally the rules/etc. are picked to make the game more interesting
2011-06-13T07:30:34  <stocha> it's mainly a wild guess, seeing that there was so much easy ways to block large corridor with 4 and 5
2011-06-13T07:30:52  <george1914> so, when will the beta server change to 9?
2011-06-13T07:30:58  <antimatroid> dunno
2011-06-13T07:31:05  <antimatroid> i want to talk to mcleopold about it
2011-06-13T07:31:12  <stocha> it won't change the bot strength to much anyway.
2011-06-13T07:31:34  <george1914> (for my beta bot, it is irrelevent atm - it doesnt know about fighting ...)
2011-06-13T07:31:35  <stocha> clustering might become more efficient though (4 is really small)
2011-06-13T07:32:33  <stocha> so full spreaders might be hit quite hard on their ranking. While bloby low ant count bots might do slitly better.
2011-06-13T07:32:49  <stocha> i think i saw both sort of bots.
2011-06-13T07:33:43  <george1914> i am spreader ...   but i seem to do ok because i kill 1for1
2011-06-13T07:42:28  <antimatroid> george1914: have you got a good food collection heuristic yet?
2011-06-13T07:42:50  <george1914> er, my bot is dead simple:
2011-06-13T07:43:09  <george1914> every ant the same instructions:
2011-06-13T07:43:32  <stocha> m
2011-06-13T07:43:35  <george1914> if you see food nearby:  use breadthfirstsearch to pick the closest (in terms of moves), and go there
2011-06-13T07:43:41  <george1914> else
2011-06-13T07:43:46  <george1914> move randomly
2011-06-13T07:43:52  <antimatroid> will you collect the same piece of food with more than one ant?
2011-06-13T07:43:52  <george1914> BUT i weight the moves
2011-06-13T07:44:00  <george1914> i have a 'potential'
2011-06-13T07:44:03  <stocha> grape of ants will go at the same food then ?
2011-06-13T07:44:15  <george1914> and random moves are weighted to move to lower 'energies'
2011-06-13T07:44:20  <antimatroid> and will you use ants that have already collected food or will spawn once you've  collected food to collect food?
2011-06-13T07:44:24  <george1914> yes - all to the same :(
2011-06-13T07:44:42  <antimatroid> ah, i'm surprised your bot is first :P
2011-06-13T07:44:59  <stocha> what i call the greedy strategy is : closest ant to food go to that food, then remove the ant and the food, rince and repeat.
2011-06-13T07:45:03  <george1914> the 'potential' is:  move away from own ants
2011-06-13T07:45:07  <antimatroid> george1914: i worked out how to do a* with multiple sources/targets
2011-06-13T07:45:11  <george1914> move towards enemy ants
2011-06-13T07:45:12  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/6Dh9Jdxg
2011-06-13T07:45:23  <george1914> move towards open space
2011-06-13T07:45:25  <stocha> spreading is a powerfull heuristic. especially if you get the 1:1 ratio.
2011-06-13T07:45:31  <george1914> move towards unexplored space
2011-06-13T07:45:41  <antimatroid> that somewhat shows an example, the numbers are the order in which that location is taken out of the search queue, the search queue has any . squares adjacent to numbers
2011-06-13T07:46:00  <george1914> i was pleasantly surprised that this quick hack could compete with the other bots ...    :)
2011-06-13T07:46:12  <george1914> reading it ...
2011-06-13T07:46:20  <stocha> greedy gathering. not strategy.
2011-06-13T07:46:28  <antimatroid> it has g(x) = current search distance from a to x, h(x) = min edist(x, *) for all *, f = g + h
2011-06-13T07:46:42  <stocha> i don't think you would do well against buggy stocha with radius 9
2011-06-13T07:46:56  <antimatroid> and you sort the search queue first by min f, and then min h if there is a tie
2011-06-13T07:47:08  <george1914> yes - i have no 'central controller'   and no messaging (except that ants avoid crashing into each otehr)
2011-06-13T07:47:12  <stocha> but then most bot won't do well against it until fighting kicks in :p
2011-06-13T07:47:25  <antimatroid> the question is, does the calculation of h for every search square added to the queue cost more than the saving in searching less squares
2011-06-13T07:47:54  <george1914> but eg liviathan has fighting - he slaughters my ants :(   but my weight of numbers (from good production) seems to overwhelm him ...
2011-06-13T07:49:05  <george1914> antimatroid: hm - so i saw you talking about a* and wondered ...   i thought it just found a 'computationally efficient' path.  (ie quick search)   but not always the shortest path ...   ?
2011-06-13T07:49:14  <antimatroid> it finds the shortest
2011-06-13T07:49:23  <george1914> BFS would guarantee shortest
2011-06-13T07:49:24  <antimatroid> it's a heuristic that is bfs in the worst case
2011-06-13T07:49:58  <antimatroid> it's still an algorthm for the shortest path pretty sure
2011-06-13T07:50:19  <stocha> empty map path finding doesn't take that much ressources in all my tests.
2011-06-13T07:50:42  <antimatroid> george1914: it uses heuristics to increase the speed of bfs, not heuristics to get the shortest path
2011-06-13T07:50:43  <george1914> how you mean pretty sure?   the algo is 'pretty sure' it is usually shortest path?
2011-06-13T07:50:54  <george1914> or you are pretty sure it is always shortest path?  :)
2011-06-13T07:50:57  <antimatroid> nah, i'm pretty sure my thoughts are right
2011-06-13T07:51:04  <george1914> oh
2011-06-13T07:51:07  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure that it does give the shortest path always
2011-06-13T07:51:13  <george1914> ok
2011-06-13T07:51:21  <george1914> then that is interesting and useful
2011-06-13T07:51:48  <antimatroid> yes, i originally dismissed it because i thought you needed a single source and destination
2011-06-13T07:52:00  <antimatroid> but it seems i can generalise it with a bit of cost
2011-06-13T07:52:19  *** stocha <stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-06-13T07:52:31  <antimatroid> for each square added to the search queue, you need to cycle through your set of target squares and find the smallest manhatten distance, otherwise the heuristic isn't admissible
2011-06-13T07:53:01  <antimatroid> there is a potential way to speed that up, but the heuristic function could be WAY off
2011-06-13T07:53:52  <antimatroid> hash the min distance between rows/cols to the target squares from a given row/col, then have your h(x) = min dist(x_row, *_row) + min dist(x_col, *_col) for all *
2011-06-13T07:53:55  <antimatroid> if that makes sense?
2011-06-13T07:53:56  <george1914> ah, ok, having re-read a* in book, you are right that it is always shorest path (at least in our case here)
2011-06-13T07:54:05  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
2011-06-13T07:54:19  <antimatroid> i learnt what a* is from the description paragraph there
2011-06-13T07:54:27  <antimatroid> then just did a couple of examples with pacer and paper
2011-06-13T07:54:44  <george1914> so your new part is that you find the shortest of 2 shortest paths - 1 to each nearby food?
2011-06-13T07:55:02  <antimatroid> no, i find one of the shortest paths from one of the sources to one of the targets
2011-06-13T07:55:12  <antimatroid> oh, so yeah? :P
2011-06-13T07:55:21  <antimatroid> here you have a single source and 2 targets
2011-06-13T07:55:25  <george1914> you find the shortest of the 2 ?
2011-06-13T07:55:31  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-13T07:55:41  <george1914> ok, nice work  :)
2011-06-13T07:55:46  <antimatroid> generally i find one of the shortest paths from one of the sources to one of the targets
2011-06-13T07:56:51  <antimatroid> you can tweak it to have sources that are available in the future

2011-06-13T07:57:10  <antimatroid> and to find the shortest path to a square that maximises the number of adjacent targets :P
2011-06-13T07:58:03  <antimatroid> that is, take the set of shortest paths to squares adjacent to targets, then the shortest path that maximises the number of adjacent targets (food squares)
2011-06-13T07:59:16  <guyverthree> hello all
2011-06-13T07:59:28  <george1914> hi guy
2011-06-13T07:59:30  <guyverthree> so your thinking about targets ahead of time
2011-06-13T07:59:33  <antimatroid> there's so many neat problems with this game
2011-06-13T07:59:39  <antimatroid> yes of course :P
2011-06-13T07:59:51  <guyverthree> I'm still figuring out simple path solving
2011-06-13T08:00:10  <guyverthree> i mean i have the most basic algorithm
2011-06-13T08:00:47  <antimatroid> are you doing a bfs with a queue?
2011-06-13T08:00:57  <antimatroid> that's where you should be starting with path finding
2011-06-13T08:00:59  <guyverthree> bfs ???
2011-06-13T08:01:08  <george1914> if it finds you the shortest path, then that is all you need for now -
2011-06-13T08:01:12  <antimatroid> breadth first search
2011-06-13T08:01:26  <antimatroid> yeah, but bfs is simple and semi decent
2011-06-13T08:02:32  <antimatroid> guyverthree: a bfs would place all source locations onto a queue of locations, then while the queue isn't empty, remove the front location, check it's adjacent non-checked locations for a target, adding non-targets to the end of the queue
2011-06-13T08:03:54  <antimatroid> sources and targets can really be interchanges, you can search from the targets back to the sources if you really want
2011-06-13T08:06:41  <guyverthree> so create a queue of all ants
2011-06-13T08:06:59  <guyverthree> then check the first ant for all the grid squares next to it for food
2011-06-13T08:07:06  <antimatroid> of their locations yeah
2011-06-13T08:07:31  <guyverthree> and add non-food to the end of the queue
2011-06-13T08:07:48  <antimatroid> you can either mark a grid of integers the number of moves it took to get there in your search and track the path back from that, or store in your queue items the path
2011-06-13T08:07:59  <antimatroid> but yeah, that's the general idea
2011-06-13T08:07:59  <guyverthree> so you end up with moves that will take your ants closer to food
2011-06-13T08:08:05  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-13T08:08:19  <guyverthree> right i see
2011-06-13T08:08:23  <antimatroid> you can just keep track of the move for the queue items instead of the path too :P
2011-06-13T08:08:36  <antimatroid> then once you've got that start considering a*
2011-06-13T08:08:49  <antimatroid> but bfs is sufficient imo
2011-06-13T08:09:02  <antimatroid> a* is if you're really wanted to squeeze every last bit of time for other things
2011-06-13T08:09:11  <guyverthree> i have some preprocessing ideas for the map
2011-06-13T08:09:31  <guyverthree> that will cut down processing of some locations
2011-06-13T08:09:51  <antimatroid> bear in mind your bot receives parameters once the process has started
2011-06-13T08:10:00  <antimatroid> post compilation
2011-06-13T08:10:42  <antimatroid> you have 3 seconds "start up time" before the game even starts though where you are given the map dimensions and game parameters, so use that time to calculate stuff if you want to
2011-06-13T08:10:51  <guyverthree> yeah
2011-06-13T08:11:03  <antimatroid> like the translations to get locations in the attack radius etc.
2011-06-13T08:11:28  <guyverthree> i was going to look at the map and consider dead ends
2011-06-13T08:15:07  <guyverthree> and then remove them from possible movement locations
2011-06-13T08:15:19  <guyverthree> as you should never mvoe there
2011-06-13T08:15:28  <guyverthree> there is no need to ever
2011-06-13T08:16:14  <antimatroid> you might want to go back and see if food has spawned there
2011-06-13T08:18:00  <guyverthree> yeah true but you have a spawn distance and an attack distance and a vision distance
2011-06-13T08:18:40  <guyverthree> so if you only ever go around thing at the smallest distance you'll reap the benfits without havign to move alot

2011-06-13T09:21:04  <carlop> I've red now the discussion about change attackrange2 to 9. seem better to me, still possible to do huge block (5-corridor perfect block) but 4-5 block are possible only in rare setting (they require a lot of space, so it's difficult to find map where is possible to do a 5-block) and they require a lot of ant
2011-06-13T09:21:42  <carlop> i love the discussion, and the requirement of non-convex pattern for attack

2011-06-13T11:21:39  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: maybe you will find this interesting.. have you every played with a* when you have multiple sources and targets in the one search?
2011-06-13T11:21:59  <a1k0n_> not with A* but dijkstra, certainly
2011-06-13T11:22:02  <antimatroid> and you want a path that minimises the distance from a source to a destination
2011-06-13T11:22:10  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/6Dh9Jdxg
2011-06-13T11:22:32  <antimatroid> if you define h(x):= min dist (x, target) for all targets, then that is admissible
2011-06-13T11:23:00  <antimatroid> the numbers there are the order in which the location would be taken off the search queue
2011-06-13T11:23:04  <a1k0n_> if it's admissible, then why didn't you get the right answer?
2011-06-13T11:23:09  <antimatroid> i did
2011-06-13T11:23:17  <antimatroid> oh erm
2011-06-13T11:23:18  <a1k0n_> isn't the * on top 8 steps away from a?
2011-06-13T11:23:21  <antimatroid> i copied it from paper
2011-06-13T11:23:22  <UncleVasya> amstan: Do you know when tools.zip will be updated?
2011-06-13T11:23:30  <antimatroid> let me see what i messed up :P
2011-06-13T11:23:34  <antimatroid> you're the first to point that out
2011-06-13T11:23:39  <amstan> UncleVasya: updated how?
2011-06-13T11:23:52  <antimatroid> hmmm crap
2011-06-13T11:24:15  <a1k0n_> i agree, in general it should work but in my experience having a discontinuous A* heuristic doesn't necessarily work
2011-06-13T11:24:37  <a1k0n_> though minimum of distance should be continuous, it just has flat spots
2011-06-13T11:25:01  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: it is the correct answer
2011-06-13T11:25:04  <McLeopold> antimatroid: let's try radius 9
2011-06-13T11:25:05  <antimatroid> the numbers are deceiving
2011-06-13T11:25:16  <antimatroid> McLeopold: :)
2011-06-13T11:25:20  <a1k0n_> oh, duh, you're right
2011-06-13T11:25:30  <a1k0n_> that's the order it's searching, not the distance
2011-06-13T11:25:35  <UncleVasya> amstan: In the latest version of ants repository on the github some cganges can be found: no --seed comand, but --player_seed and --engine_seed, also a little different replay format.
2011-06-13T11:25:45  <antimatroid> it's the order it's taking locations off the search queue to be precise
2011-06-13T11:25:56  <amstan> UncleVasya: you know you can make your own tools.zip right?
2011-06-13T11:26:07  <a1k0n_> yeah, ok.  so it reaches the goal in 10 steps.
2011-06-13T11:26:20  <antimatroid> one has to cycle through all targets to calculate h when adding a location to the search queue, which is where i'm not sure if it's better/worse than normal bfs
2011-06-13T11:26:28  <amstan> UncleVasya: updated\
2011-06-13T11:26:41  <janzert> playgame.py defaults are not used on the server
2011-06-13T11:26:44  <a1k0n_> yes, it's O(X*Y) to solve for the whole map
2011-06-13T11:26:50  <carlop> antimatroid: the h(x) if you have multiple target should be min (distance(x, target)) over each target
2011-06-13T11:26:58  <a1k0n_> (with regular bfs i mean)
2011-06-13T11:27:10  <janzert> I believe for game settings what is actually used are the settings in website/server_info.php
2011-06-13T11:27:23  * antimatroid is terrible at complexity/whatever stuff :P
2011-06-13T11:27:44  <McLeopold> actually, changing the beta server to 9 won't really tell us much, since there are no blocking bots yet
2011-06-13T11:27:48  <antimatroid> there is an alternative heurstic function that can severely underestimate the distance
2011-06-13T11:28:02  <a1k0n_> let me put it this way: if you "expand" from each food source using two lists (one to pop from, one to push onto), you will visit every square only once
2011-06-13T11:28:04  <UncleVasya> amstan: if people use my testing app with tools.zip from the site it's working. But if they use the updates it doesn't.
2011-06-13T11:28:19  <amstan> ic
2011-06-13T11:28:20  <antimatroid> (min dist(x_row, target_row)) + (min dist(x_col, target_col)
2011-06-13T11:28:23  <amstan> well.. i just updated it
2011-06-13T11:28:27  <antimatroid> but you could hash information to make it faster
2011-06-13T11:28:28  <amstan> should be in sync with the git over there
2011-06-13T11:28:37  <UncleVasya> So I need to do one of these things:  1. ask users to define which format to use  and  2. support only one format.
2011-06-13T11:29:24  <McLeopold> janzert: for worker games, it comes from the task info, which comes from server_info.php, otherwise it comes from server_info.py in the worker dir

2011-06-13T11:30:37  <a1k0n_> the point is, you can solve the problem of routing every square to its nearest food by visiting every square on the map once
2011-06-13T11:30:40  <carlop> antimatroid: i think distance should be dist(x_row, target_row)+dist(y_row, target_row)  (manhattan metric, the same of movement), but H function should be computed as minimum over each possible target
2011-06-13T11:30:54  <a1k0n_> so it doesn't matter how many ants you have

2011-06-13T11:31:26  <a1k0n_> that is a lot of ants
2011-06-13T11:32:01  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: well, yes; that's true.  it should be possible to do local fixups though.

2011-06-13T12:09:24  <carlop> these two block are perfect, but it's hard to find a lot of space where put all these ant
2011-06-13T12:09:33  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-13T12:10:05  <antimatroid> and even if you have a good defensive structure that isn't perfectly blocked, after some smart suicides it might/should be possible to break it down
2011-06-13T12:10:25  <antimatroid> depending on how many ants they have ready to rebuild the defensive strucutre
2011-06-13T12:11:01  <carlop> so it's almost impossible to do perfect block, in normal situation perfect defense vs perfect attack have a huge boost (eg 1:3, 1:2 instead of 1:1) but an huge army should win in the end

2011-06-13T12:19:08  <amstan_> i really think we should integrate the food spawner into the mapgenerator
2011-06-13T12:19:10  <mleise> antimatroid: Classical symmetries will be nice and the attack radius of 3 seems to be acceptable. I expected it to look wrong
2011-06-13T12:19:24  <antimatroid> i have been asking for that for ages
2011-06-13T12:19:35  <amstan_> antimatroid: well.. it's your department, why don't you do it?
2011-06-13T12:19:38  <antimatroid> not the food spawner, but the maps should have a parameter indicating the type of symmetry
2011-06-13T12:19:53  <antimatroid> i just need the engine to read the symmetric type and use the right spawn method
2011-06-13T12:20:08  <antimatroid> then the default can be set back to asymmetric
2011-06-13T12:20:28  <mleise> We have map generators in Java and OCaml, so it would be nice if it didn't have to be coupled with Python directly.
2011-06-13T12:20:42  <antimatroid> does that mean I can finally write my map gens in c++ :P

2011-06-13T12:26:55  <carlop> just a suggestion, I don't have read a lot of map generation/food spawning code, but a possible solution is that the map file should have a list of group of cell that are all symmetrical, eg: rotational symmetry the four corner are in the same group, and so on, so the spawing code should only choose between a group of cell, then spawning in all cell of that group

2011-06-13T12:34:25  <McLeopold> for symmetric food spawning
2011-06-13T12:34:34  <McLeopold> I suggest this
2011-06-13T12:34:38  <antimatroid> why can't the maps just have a paramater "symmetry none/tiled/radial"
2011-06-13T12:34:46  <antimatroid> then the engine uses that to pick the spawn method?
2011-06-13T12:34:49  <McLeopold> s row col [ns][ew]
2011-06-13T12:35:03  <McLeopold> s for symmetry
2011-06-13T12:35:21  <amstan_> antimatroid: no... bad terms
2011-06-13T12:35:27  <antimatroid> terms are irrelevant
2011-06-13T12:35:30  <antimatroid> the method is important
2011-06-13T12:35:53  <amstan_> antimatroid: translation(yours), rotation(like smiley), mirror(like the java one)
2011-06-13T12:36:04  <antimatroid> yep sure
2011-06-13T12:36:09  <antimatroid> McLeopold: ?
2011-06-13T12:36:14  <McLeopold> right now the current one assumes (correctly) that all ants face the same way, so when spawning food 2 squares above, it does 2 squares above all starting spots
2011-06-13T12:36:39  <McLeopold> this would allow the engine to know 2 squares above one ant is 2 below another, and 2 right of yet another, etc
2011-06-13T12:36:40  <antimatroid> it's more complicated than that
2011-06-13T12:36:57  <antimatroid> it partitions the squares on "first access" for a basis to one ant then orders them randomly
2011-06-13T12:37:02  <antimatroid> then spawns those locations symmetrically
2011-06-13T12:38:10  <McLeopold> my info would still work for describing the symmetric, regardless of the type of symmetry
2011-06-13T12:38:13  <carlop> for me the simpler option should be that the map file should be:
2011-06-13T12:38:15  <carlop> rows #row
2011-06-13T12:38:17  <carlop> cols #col
2011-06-13T12:38:19  <carlop> player #player
2011-06-13T12:38:21  <carlop> m .......
2011-06-13T12:38:23  <carlop> m ......
2011-06-13T12:38:25  <carlop> m .....
2011-06-13T12:38:27  <carlop> (other map line)
2011-06-13T12:38:29  <carlop> 1: (1,1) (1+row/2, 1) (1, 1+col/2) (1+row/2, 1+col/2)
2011-06-13T12:38:30  <carlop> 2: other cell that are symmetrical to each other
2011-06-13T12:38:32  <carlop> 3: other cell that are symmetrical
2011-06-13T12:38:34  <carlop> ....
2011-06-13T12:38:35  <carlop> so the food spawning code should only choose one of the group of cell
2011-06-13T12:38:56  <McLeopold> carlop: use pastebin.com next time
2011-06-13T12:39:41  <carlop> sorry, my idea is that the map should not tell what kind of symmetry have, only what cell are symmetrical to each other
2011-06-13T12:39:42  <antimatroid> making the maps files complicated makes it really hard to make simple test maps
2011-06-13T12:40:02  <amstan_> McLeopold: i think we should merge the mapgen and the food spawner, then we get to have 2 types of classes, one for generating a part of the map, and the other for keeping stuff symmetric(either kind)

2011-06-13T12:47:03  <antimatroid> then extra symmetries require an extra food spawning method if required, then the engine knows how to handle the different types of symmetries?
2011-06-13T12:47:21  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: engine_seed is for the engine only and used for food_spawning, player_seed is passed to the bots and they can use it to make their bot deterministic

2011-06-13T12:54:59  <antimatroid> the starter bots (at least my one does :P) ignore unknown lines
2011-06-13T12:55:21  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: why aren't you using c++?
2011-06-13T12:55:41  <antimatroid> nevermind, you're using ocaml

2011-06-13T12:58:57  <UncleVasya> It's about game theory.

2011-06-13T13:03:46  <mleise> shh antimatroidm, if you piss him off I'll never learn about that game theory secret
2011-06-13T13:04:36  <antimatroid> i'm not trying to piss anyone off :P
2011-06-13T13:04:45  <UncleVasya> I am not doing chess programming, just like to read sites where smart people have their conversation. I can't understand much from this conversations but it's makes me proud of myself like "I don't play online games, I am reading smar sites *cool_boy*"
2011-06-13T13:05:55  <McLeopold> antimatroid: okay, does the ant orientation stuff make sense in that paste?
2011-06-13T13:06:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold: no :P
2011-06-13T13:06:10  <mleise> no
2011-06-13T13:06:19  <UncleVasya> So, I found the contest very interesting. I had watching replays and reading talking about different strategies.

2011-06-13T13:06:41  <antimatroid> why are there large gaps of no dots?
2011-06-13T13:06:49  <UncleVasya> But I didn't think about participiating because I didn't think I can do something.
2011-06-13T13:07:06  <antimatroid> and what if the other ants aren't perfectly n/e/s/w/ne/nw/se/sw?
2011-06-13T13:07:06  <McLeopold> so you can see the 4 sections of the map, just assume the map is correctly defined
2011-06-13T13:07:44  <McLeopold> the orientation describes how food will spawn, not a true direction, you always need 2 components
2011-06-13T13:07:59  <antimatroid> oh
2011-06-13T13:08:08  <antimatroid> that is the +ve direction when translating?
2011-06-13T13:08:13  <McLeopold> for a ant, spawn a food and then determine the n/s distance and the e/w distance
2011-06-13T13:08:39  <McLeopold> yes, i think
2011-06-13T13:08:43  <antimatroid> yeah i think i'm with you now
2011-06-13T13:08:46  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-13T13:09:03  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-06-13T13:09:16  <antimatroid> i'll do that to my map gen on wednesday
2011-06-13T13:09:20  <UncleVasya> Also, from all these languages I had touch only to c++. A very very little touch like "define the maximal element of this 1-dimentional array of integers".
2011-06-13T13:09:20  <janzert> couldn't you land on water sometimes on a rotational symmetry map, with that method?
2011-06-13T13:09:22  <McLeopold> you always need 1 of [ns] and 1 of [ew], which can be in either order
2011-06-13T13:09:24  <carlop> 2 direction are right, but some of your example seem wrong
2011-06-13T13:09:40  <antimatroid> janzert: yes, the engine deals with that
2011-06-13T13:09:44  <janzert> ok
2011-06-13T13:09:48  <McLeopold> antimatroid: all you have to do is add nw for everythine :p
2011-06-13T13:09:57  <carlop> es rotation should be NW, EN, SE, WS
2011-06-13T13:10:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yeah, but i'll be doing other symmetries at some point
2011-06-13T13:10:35  <McLeopold> carlop: yes, you're right
2011-06-13T13:10:36  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: where's the game theory? :)
2011-06-13T13:10:37  <UncleVasya> Once I found unofficial Delphi starter pack on the forums. I decided: "It's destiny!"
2011-06-13T13:10:47  <UncleVasya> In the end of the story :)
2011-06-13T13:10:49  <McLeopold> what I did was 4 player mirror, oops
2011-06-13T13:12:24  <amstan> what about a mirror that's diagonal?
2011-06-13T13:12:47  <carlop> my major problem why we should limit the symmetry type ? why just not integrate map and spawing code OR make the map file contain every possible information ?
2011-06-13T13:12:49  <McLeopold> janzert: we could do a check to match the starting orientation with the map to ensure it was properly symmetric, according to the maps own definition
2011-06-13T13:13:01  <UncleVasya> I've started to improve starter bot. I had found it not so hard how I had to think before.
2011-06-13T13:13:27  <McLeopold> amstan: I think nw on one ant and wn on another would work
2011-06-13T13:13:46  <amstan> ok
2011-06-13T13:13:50  <UncleVasya> But Delphi package didn't became an officialone so I could play only locally.
2011-06-13T13:14:13  <McLeopold> actually nw ws
2011-06-13T13:14:46  <mleise> UncleVasya: Do you want to buy my Turbo Delphi 2006?
2011-06-13T13:15:05  <antimatroid> lol
2011-06-13T13:15:13  <antimatroid> oh, it's pie time
2011-06-13T13:15:15  <antimatroid> pi*
2011-06-13T13:15:18  <antimatroid> 3 14
2011-06-13T13:15:20  <McLeopold> carlop: I think this method doesn't limit symmetry type
2011-06-13T13:15:35  <amstan> antimatroid: nope.. 1 minute late
2011-06-13T13:15:56  <antimatroid> (03:14:51) antimatroid: 3 14
2011-06-13T13:15:57  <McLeopold> 7 hours late...
2011-06-13T13:16:10  <amstan> [13:15] <antimatroid> oh, it's pie time
2011-06-13T13:16:14  <UncleVasya> I have a friend who likes C++. I've downloaded a C++ starter pack and with a lot of questions to this friend started to translate Delphi bot into the c++ one.
2011-06-13T13:16:15  <antimatroid> flip that 51 to 15
2011-06-13T13:16:18  <antimatroid> then we're good
2011-06-13T13:16:42  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah, that might be a good double check in any case
2011-06-13T13:16:49  <antimatroid> why not just use the current c++ starter bot?
2011-06-13T13:16:56  <McLeopold> okay, let's bake this into the spec then
2011-06-13T13:17:19  <mleise> anyway 13:37 is the leetest time of day
2011-06-13T13:17:28  <antimatroid> nah, 3:26
2011-06-13T13:17:39  <McLeopold> janzert: I hope to have the manager generate a set of about 20 new maps per day after we launch.  It can to the symmetric check.
2011-06-13T13:18:33  <UncleVasya> Then goes very-very interesting time of participiating to the Planet Wars. Loved it. It's definitely one of the best 1.5 monthes of my life.
2011-06-13T13:18:39  <UncleVasya> STL is cool.
2011-06-13T13:19:06  <UncleVasya> I've ended previous contest on the place 310.
2011-06-13T13:19:43  <UncleVasya> Which I think very good for me since it was my first serious program.
2011-06-13T13:19:44  <mleise> McLeopold: Btw, I'm glad we still store the maps in the replay. I think it was the right decision.
2011-06-13T13:20:21  <antimatroid> tron was my first serious program, did not finish :(
2011-06-13T13:20:42  <a1k0n_> that is pretty good.  it beat my planetwars entry
2011-06-13T13:21:03  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: like that was hard :P
2011-06-13T13:21:07  <a1k0n_> haha
2011-06-13T13:21:11  <UncleVasya> I can say I've learned programming while was developing bot for Planed Wars (almost everything before - simple Delphi programs for studying).
2011-06-13T13:21:20  <mleise> Was noone of the regulars below 479 in Planet Wars?
2011-06-13T13:21:39  <antimatroid> i beat smiley, that's what I cared about
2011-06-13T13:22:13  <antimatroid> it's nice being able to link this http://ai-contest.com/country_profile.php?country_id=25 to people (particularly in australia) :P

2011-06-13T13:26:28  <antimatroid> my bot?
2011-06-13T13:26:37  <antimatroid> the tree had a HUGE bug
2011-06-13T13:26:37  <UncleVasya> yep
2011-06-13T13:26:40  <antimatroid> like memory leak worthy
2011-06-13T13:27:11  <UncleVasya> I've downloaded only C++ bots because I couldn't understand another languages that time.
2011-06-13T13:27:15  <mleise> congrats for not writing obfuscated code ... well with lisp that was a first ((((grade (((problem)) (i guess))))))
2011-06-13T13:27:57  <antimatroid> i wouldn't describe my planet wars code as readable, it's nice to hear someone else describe it as such, thanks :)
2011-06-13T13:28:14  <antimatroid> i guess it was just saying it was more readable than the others, which isn't necessarily saying it was readable
2011-06-13T13:28:34  <UncleVasya> yes, comparing to other's code.
2011-06-13T13:28:48  <UncleVasya> And only comparing to the strong bots.
2011-06-13T13:29:58  <UncleVasya> But I'm too lazy! Very soon I'd returned to my usual life: serial movies, videogames, etc.
2011-06-13T13:30:22  <UncleVasya> So to the Ants I come without any skill improvemennts.
2011-06-13T13:30:53  <UncleVasya> Without any game thery stuff. :(
2011-06-13T13:31:37  <antimatroid> you don't really need much game theory for these contests
2011-06-13T13:31:43  <carlop> a possible problem of food spawning code is that if someone keep his ant waiting (if they have nothing to do) he lose food that can't be placed, so this code favor ant that keep moving (maybe only back and forth)
2011-06-13T13:32:01  <antimatroid> carlop: you say that like it's a bad thing :P
2011-06-13T13:32:17  <antimatroid> well known problem, it's the best symmetric spawning method we could come up with
2011-06-13T13:32:28  <mleise> carlop: Unnessecary movement is bad
2011-06-13T13:32:33  <UncleVasya> So my bot will be weak and very likely I'll end Ants competition in the worse position than PW one.
2011-06-13T13:32:38  <antimatroid> otherwise ants positions can affect the spawn location of food at another part of the map
2011-06-13T13:32:53  <antimatroid> mleise: this encourages you to keep moving
2011-06-13T13:32:54  <mleise> But doesn't the food just get held back until the square is free?
2011-06-13T13:32:59  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-13T13:33:01  <UncleVasya> I found a justification for myself:
2011-06-13T13:33:11  <carlop> maybe food can be spawned in the nearest unoccupied land
2011-06-13T13:33:18  <carlop> almost symmetric
2011-06-13T13:33:26  <UncleVasya> My bot will be weak because I'll write it in the very hard language :)
2011-06-13T13:33:29  <antimatroid> i'm not a fan of almost symmetric
2011-06-13T13:33:38  <antimatroid> even though this is as well
2011-06-13T13:33:41  <antimatroid> but i prefer this
2011-06-13T13:33:54  <UncleVasya> This is the end.
2011-06-13T13:33:56  <mleise> carlop: Your ants build up a grid, right? :p
2011-06-13T13:34:05  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: :)
2011-06-13T13:35:02  <carlop> can be a good to favor moving ant, just I noticed that thing only reading the code
2011-06-13T13:35:03  <UncleVasya> Not much game theory in my story but I wanted someone to hear it :)
2011-06-13T13:35:23  <UncleVasya> antimatroid:  Do you regret you'd listeningto it?

2011-06-13T13:37:41  <george1914> UncleVasya's fireside stories ...
2011-06-13T13:37:41  <UncleVasya> You'll dream about UncleVasya who trie to talk with you in the ugly English:)
2011-06-13T13:37:41  <george1914> should there not be a moral to the tale?
2011-06-13T13:39:24  <UncleVasya> george1914:  Are you asking me to add morale or to call that a story instead of a tale?
2011-06-13T13:39:48  <a1k0n_> so is there a uniform distribution of food-spawning throughout the map?  or does it depend on where ants are?
2011-06-13T13:40:15  <george1914> i was just asking ...    nice story btw.
2011-06-13T13:40:21  <a1k0n_> cool story bro
2011-06-13T13:40:41  <UncleVasya> I'll try to talk less until learn some language :)
2011-06-13T13:40:56  <a1k0n_> ants has plenty of game theory to it.
2011-06-13T13:41:06  <carlop> if you keep moving all your ant, there is uniform distribution
2011-06-13T13:41:21  <a1k0n_> i don't understand why it matters whether your ants are moving
2011-06-13T13:41:56  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: what game theory?
2011-06-13T13:41:57  <carlop> cause if food should spawn in an occupied cell, spawn when this cell become free
2011-06-13T13:42:12  <mleise> Isn't it best to seperate your ants as much as possible without losing sight on some squares?
2011-06-13T13:42:14  <george1914> a1k0n_ it does?   - i see GT for combat i guess.    and for global strategy (who/should i choose to attack).  these are what you refer to?
2011-06-13T13:42:22  <antimatroid> mleise: not for battles
2011-06-13T13:42:45  <a1k0n_> george1914/antimatroid: not only that, but just where to station your ants so as to provide the maximum likelihood of obtaining food next turn
2011-06-13T13:42:45  <sigh> antimatroid, I remember you saying you were going to sleep when I first logged in :P
2011-06-13T13:42:49  <carlop> so if you have a large portion of your territory always occupied you lose a lot of food
2011-06-13T13:42:51  <mleise> antimatroid: Sure, not for battles, but the rest? I see a lot of ants still going around in bunches ;p
2011-06-13T13:43:03  <antimatroid> sigh: you should know me better

2011-06-13T13:44:44  <antimatroid> not condescending
2011-06-13T13:44:45  <a1k0n_> UncleVasya: lol
2011-06-13T13:44:48  <george1914> Margusja: hm, maybe putt all files in the zip,  BUT NOT in dirwectories?
2011-06-13T13:45:01  <a1k0n_> i'm not being condescending at all
2011-06-13T13:45:06  <carlop> mleise: yes, I know this can be a solution
2011-06-13T13:45:10  <george1914> me neither
2011-06-13T13:45:17  <a1k0n_> but i'm laughing that you think 20 isn't young
2011-06-13T13:45:25  <a1k0n_> so now i *am* being condescending
2011-06-13T13:45:30  <antimatroid> you shut up, i'm 22 and young!
2011-06-13T13:45:36  <berak> Margusja, you had an MyBot.o file in that zip, the compiler got confused there, upload the cc and h files only

2011-06-13T13:46:39  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: to be fair, their comment more implies 20 isn't young :P
2011-06-13T13:46:41  <UncleVasya> I mean that programmer at 20 already should know programming and English.
2011-06-13T13:46:42  <Margusja> berak, so I have to remove all .o files? Or only MyBot.o ?
2011-06-13T13:47:26  <antimatroid> margusja: just select the .h and .cc files and zip those
2011-06-13T13:47:28  <berak> better stick to only the cc and h files
2011-06-13T13:47:29  <antimatroid> not in a filder

2011-06-13T13:47:37  <Margusja> Ok, I;ll try only with cc and h. files.
2011-06-13T13:47:53  <Margusja> tnx, I'll try
2011-06-13T13:48:14  <antimatroid> Margusja: have you got the newest c++ starter bot?
2011-06-13T13:48:31  <antimatroid> if the timer file has two structs, you're good, otherwise download it again ;)
2011-06-13T13:48:38  <a1k0n_> UncleVasya: anyways, i think applying for instance alpha-beta search, which is what i think you wanted to do when you said game theory is the way to go, will be very difficult for ants as it was difficult for planetwars; but it was easy for Tron, and it might be fun for you to try making a Tron-playing bot
2011-06-13T13:48:57  <a1k0n_> UncleVasya: not that you should give up on ants!
2011-06-13T13:49:03  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: did you use alpha-beta while generating your tree?
2011-06-13T13:49:07  <antimatroid> or only when evaluating it?
2011-06-13T13:49:20  <Margusja> antimatroid: I dont now. I have that one i downloaded from http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/starter_packages.php
2011-06-13T13:49:27  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: er.. alpha-beta implies a cutoff when generating the tree
2011-06-13T13:49:33  <antimatroid> Margusja: it changed recently
2011-06-13T13:49:49  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: i don't trust that at all
2011-06-13T13:49:54  <a1k0n_> ?!
2011-06-13T13:50:11  <Margusja> Ok, I'll download i again.
2011-06-13T13:50:17  <a1k0n_> well, if your evaluation function is to be believed then you don't lose anything by doing it.  i guess that's the rub.
2011-06-13T13:50:23  <UncleVasya> a1k0n_: I didn't think about alpha-beta because I thought it is better for board games and games with not simulultaneously moves.
2011-06-13T13:50:34  <a1k0n_> UncleVasya: it doesn't actually matter very much for tron.
2011-06-13T13:50:35  <antimatroid> yeah but your evaluation of a state is not complete :P

2011-06-13T13:50:46  <antimatroid> it's possible for it to miss an optimal move

2011-06-13T13:51:12  <antimatroid> i cry
2011-06-13T13:51:34  <antimatroid> games have a ridiculous state size
2011-06-13T13:51:53  <george1914> i did full tree, simultaneous moves, and calculated the Nash payoff matrix +mixed strategy at each node
2011-06-13T13:51:59  <george1914> (for tron)
2011-06-13T13:52:01  <a1k0n_> and, in the case of planet wars and ants, a ridiculous action cardinality

2011-06-13T13:53:03  <george1914> well, i got only 1/2 the search depth of alpha-beat,
2011-06-13T13:53:27  <antimatroid> george1914: a complete game tree?
2011-06-13T13:53:30  <antimatroid> erm?
2011-06-13T13:53:31  <george1914> and the cost of finding mixed strategy reduced the depth possible also
2011-06-13T13:54:04  <george1914> so, i had some state evaluation function,  and then i searchd to some depth, eg 10moves (each) ahead
2011-06-13T13:54:21  <antimatroid> i can't wait to redo tron
2011-06-13T13:54:51  <a1k0n_> never!
2011-06-13T13:55:06  <McLeopold> amstan: Is your graphic designer going to do stuff?  If he's not doing it now, let's not bother and I'll close the issue.
2011-06-13T13:55:13  <a1k0n_> there should be a mode in ants where your ants leave a trail of water behind
2011-06-13T13:55:20  <antimatroid> it'll be the first game up on zeta
2011-06-13T13:55:30  <amstan> McLeopold: well.. we need to tell him what to do
2011-06-13T13:55:39  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: i considered a variation where every move left an ant
2011-06-13T13:55:47  <McLeopold> we need people that just do
2011-06-13T13:56:00  <a1k0n_> that would be insane; you'd have 2^n ants on turn n
2011-06-13T13:56:06  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-13T13:56:11  <a1k0n_> (except you wouldn't)
2011-06-13T13:56:13  <antimatroid> i also want to play flood fill wars
2011-06-13T13:56:19  <a1k0n_> heh
2011-06-13T13:56:22  <antimatroid> not sure how to do it, but it'd be awesome
2011-06-13T13:56:49  <antimatroid> start with a randomly partitioned grid, then flood fill wars on that would make sense
2011-06-13T13:59:19  <a1k0n_> that would be... tron
2011-06-13T14:03:29  <antimatroid> how?

2011-06-13T14:04:46  <antimatroid> you pick a square and that and every connected square of that character becomes your player number

2011-06-13T18:40:16  <guyverthree> hey guys this might seem like a stupid question but how do you tell what ant is your ant ???
2011-06-13T18:40:36  <olexs1> when you get an "a" line with ID 0, it's yours
2011-06-13T18:40:48  <olexs1> any other ID is enemy
2011-06-13T18:41:03  <guyverthree> ah i see
2011-06-13T18:41:18  <olexs1> first enemy you encounter in a game gets ID 1, second 2, and so on
2011-06-13T18:41:28  <guyverthree> thanks very much i was having an odd case of ants smacking into each other

2011-06-13T18:42:27  <george1914> olexs1: hi - you're leviathan right?  i'm enjoying watching your bot exchange places with mine alll the time ...    :)
2011-06-13T18:42:43  <george1914> seems yo-u have implemented fighting tactics?
2011-06-13T18:42:56  <olexs1> some fairly simple ones, yes
2011-06-13T18:43:23  <george1914> well, i've watched your ants slaughter my ants many times ...
2011-06-13T18:43:24  <george1914> :/
2011-06-13T18:43:26  <olexs1> they'll probably break if attack radius gets changed, as people discuss around here
2011-06-13T18:43:27  <Zaphus> yeah, cool to see some smart fighting, I have none of it :-)
2011-06-13T18:43:49  <guyverthree> me either i just push ants together
2011-06-13T18:43:58  <Zaphus> wow, nice to see my BlockTest program has leapt up the leaderboards to 7th now that it is attackradius2=9
2011-06-13T18:44:00  <guyverthree> your close i kil you
2011-06-13T18:44:07  <olexs1> so far the "tactics" are just hardcoded situations and responses
2011-06-13T18:44:11  <george1914> aye - i was/am aiming to add it, but might delay until after radius etc is fixed ...
2011-06-13T18:44:15  <guyverthree> attack radius 9 ??
2011-06-13T18:44:44  <george1914> 9 was the latest story, but doesnt seem to be quite fixed yet, and isnt in production ...
2011-06-13T18:44:45  <Zaphus> well, squared=9
2011-06-13T18:44:52  <olexs1> so 3
2011-06-13T18:45:09  <Zaphus> that's live on the beta server right now, isnt it ?
2011-06-13T18:45:30  <george1914> olexs1: hardcoded?  i am impressed/surprised - i had assumed it was eg a 2 more lookahead
2011-06-13T18:45:48  <george1914> plus a 'retreat and get the enemy to follow into a trap'  :)
2011-06-13T18:46:04  <olexs1> george1914: I don't do any simulation yet. retreat is implemented, yes :)
2011-06-13T18:46:12  <george1914> ...checking latest games ....
2011-06-13T18:46:31  <olexs1> retreating to safest direction and crying for help is what my ants will do a lot
2011-06-13T18:46:39  <george1914> :)
2011-06-13T18:47:05  <Zaphus> I'm waking 'Zaphus' up again, should be more competitive, I'm done with timeout testing for now
2011-06-13T18:47:14  <olexs1> and when help comes, a formation will spring up most of the times, a predefined situation comes up, and the killing begins :)
2011-06-13T18:47:17  <george1914> ok, see you at the top :)
2011-06-13T18:47:39  <Zaphus> website isnt responding for me right now...
2011-06-13T18:47:48  <olexs1> I must go now, will work on my bot some more this week. see you guys around
2011-06-13T18:47:55  <Zaphus> cya
2011-06-13T18:48:03  <george1914> hm.  i am really looking forwqard to seeing the bots evolve and improve - we will likely look back at this simple stage with nostalgia, in a few weeks/months   :)

2011-06-13T18:48:19  <george1914> ok, i look forward to seeing it in action, bye.
2011-06-13T18:48:50  <george1914> website was slow, but i go it eventually
2011-06-13T18:49:26  <Zaphus> yep, current server has attackradius at 3 (i.e. attackradius2=9), at least thats what I'm seeing in the battles, kills from 3 squares away
2011-06-13T18:50:17  <george1914> you are right   (a few hours ago it wasnt in)   tyhanks for the info, i should start coding ...
2011-06-13T18:50:54  <Zaphus> I just modified mine to check the radius and use it, for simple avoidance - it's a shy bot :-)
2011-06-13T18:51:07  <george1914> btw, you dont happen to know who owns the beta website do you?  and whether he will read my code and get ideas from it?   :)
2011-06-13T18:51:39  <george1914> (nothing secreat in my current bot, but there might be soon)
2011-06-13T18:51:50  <Zaphus> no idea, I hope he doesnt, I like to think I've got some smarts in there that others wont think of and I'd hate for it to be stolen.   was trying to find a free obfuscator just to be safe but found nothing so far
2011-06-13T18:52:19  <Zaphus> crap, gotta go sorry, just saw the time !   see you on the leaderboard!
2011-06-13T18:52:39  <george1914> see you

2011-06-13T20:14:37  <mleise> amstan: It came to my ears that Facebook is using a tool called hiphop to convert PHP into C++ code and compile that.
2011-06-13T20:15:17  <amstan> mleise: yes, i know
2011-06-13T20:17:15  <jbroman> mleise: In fact, they wrote it themselves. It's useful on Facebook's scale, but I don't think most people would benefit as much from HPHP.
2011-06-13T20:23:15  <mleise> I just talked with someone who is writing a persistence framework that uses the compiler to create prepared statements for db table <-> struct associations. It even supports limiting the result set through 'LIMIT' when you use only a slice of the db table rows.
2011-06-13T20:24:50  <mleise> It looks awesome. You just instanciate the Persistence template with your struct and can do "posts[9..0]" to query the posts table for the first 10 entries in reverse order.
2011-06-13T20:25:54  <mleise> If I had that in Java a few years ago that would have helped me some.
