2010-10-05T01:40:48  <sigh> ?
2010-10-05T01:41:09  <sigh> that explains the jump in scores at the top then
2010-10-05T01:41:10  <antimatroid2> i thought it would be nicer for the lower ranked people to at least have a positive score, even if any reaction based off that is somewhat irrational
2010-10-05T01:41:18  <antimatroid2> i expect they're just + 2000 or something

2010-10-05T01:41:39  <sigh> antimatroid2: nah, my point is that even with the 2000 offset it is getting close to zero
2010-10-05T01:42:07  <antimatroid2> yeah, perhaps some will drop below 0 then
2010-10-05T01:42:13  <antimatroid2> given 4000+ was breached
2010-10-05T01:42:22  <sigh> yup
2010-10-05T01:43:04  <antimatroid2> i decided the best strategy in the second my of my examples this morning was to send all of your ships for whatever moves into the future to your closest neutral
2010-10-05T01:43:15  <antimatroid2> but i think you can increase the ship size of the neutrals so that no longer works
2010-10-05T01:43:23  <antimatroid2> giving the kind of example i was originally aiming ofr
2010-10-05T01:43:26  <antimatroid2> if that makes any sense?
2010-10-05T01:43:33  <sigh> antimatroid2: my current bot does something similar

2010-10-05T01:47:54  <antimatroid2> but 100000 is a LOT
2010-10-05T01:48:00  <rabidus> 08:36 < antimatroid2> i'd even be happy for lots of well picked 3-4 planet maps being in the final tournament
2010-10-05T01:48:04  <rabidus> lol
2010-10-05T01:48:20  <sigh> that's because he wants to solve with his game theory
2010-10-05T01:48:28  <rabidus> aah
2010-10-05T01:48:41  <sigh> and by "well-picked" means "solved by antimatroid2"
2010-10-05T01:48:44  <sigh> *where
2010-10-05T01:48:49  <rabidus> :p
2010-10-05T01:49:29  <antimatroid2> but everyone else would be expected to do the same, i just consider it interesting to see what the best strategies are
2010-10-05T01:49:37  <antimatroid2> not what sort of did well on randomly generated maps against people
2010-10-05T01:49:39  <antimatroid2> why not both?
2010-10-05T01:50:05  <rabidus> actually 100 games with each randomly generated maps are something like 23000 planet map :)
2010-10-05T01:50:22  <sigh> wh?
2010-10-05T01:50:24  <sigh> *eh?
2010-10-05T01:50:24  <antimatroid2> rabidus: you aren't accounting for all those planets at once
2010-10-05T01:51:58  <rabidus> yes, not. but. if you use imagination you can count them as... 'partial win'.. or something. When you win a map, and new map begins, you can think that new planet in new map as old galaxy
2010-10-05T01:52:09  <rabidus> :p

2010-10-05T03:34:59  <rwa> tried that a bit
2010-10-05T03:36:18  <antimatroid2> didn't work well?
2010-10-05T03:36:28  <antimatroid2> i started, but don't really have time to work on ai for at least a week
2010-10-05T03:36:43  <rwa> was tough to find a way to model things in a way that was tractable but gave useful results
2010-10-05T03:37:02  <antimatroid2> yeah, it's going to be messy, but i don't see how else to look ahead
2010-10-05T03:37:21  <antimatroid2> i think it's better to do lots of moves per layer and less layers rather than try to penetrate very far
2010-10-05T03:37:31  <rwa> agree 100%
2010-10-05T03:37:37  <antimatroid2> have you considered even letting current terminal nodes running for a certain number of games themselves?
2010-10-05T03:37:48  <antimatroid2> possibly even trying to somewhat predict characteristics of their bot?
2010-10-05T03:38:15  <antimatroid2> it's tricky business working out how to evaluate the payoff for a given gamestate
2010-10-05T03:38:22  <rwa> antimatroid2: pondered those ideas some, yes, but no impl. yet
2010-10-05T03:38:58  <rwa> if you're going to try to be predictive, what you should do against good vs bad bots varies wildly.
2010-10-05T03:39:19  <antimatroid2> although, you can just do well against good bots, and assume that will beat a bad bot
2010-10-05T03:39:23  <antimatroid2> that is my general approach
2010-10-05T03:40:28  <rwa> antimatroid2: generally, yes
2010-10-05T03:40:57  <antimatroid2> it hasn't really failed me on this yet either

2010-10-05T06:07:34  <tty1> ya know what would be cool... if this game had humans and bots playing eachother with each knowing if the other is a player or bot, this way the bot could learn from the humans, and the best ranked bot wins. Also would be interesting to see how the bots compare to the humans overall.

2010-10-05T07:52:54  <rabidus> wish i could write in to file...
2010-10-05T07:52:58  <sigh> all bots must have heuristics of some sort
2010-10-05T07:52:59  <rabidus> so bot would actually learn

2010-10-05T12:10:51  <jmcarthur> i've been wanting to make a visualization of the leaderboard. some sort of box and whisker plot maybe
2010-10-05T12:10:59  <Janzert> now I wonder why, since I have seen bayeselo give nonsymmetric ones before
2010-10-05T12:11:05  <jmcarthur> i'd need more data than is currently shown though
2010-10-05T12:11:12  <jmcarthur> Janzert: different parameters
2010-10-05T12:11:23  <jmcarthur> bayeselo has like 50 different ways to compute stuff
2010-10-05T12:11:45  <Janzert> yeah
2010-10-05T12:12:01  * Janzert goes to dig into the specific way bayeselo is being called
2010-10-05T12:12:12  <jmcarthur> i believe it's a .sh script
2010-10-05T12:13:03  <Janzert> yes, although it is just feeding the output of readgames.py into bayeselo

2010-10-05T12:25:03  <Janzert> hmm, bayeselo is being used completely with just the defaults. If I remember right these give a small boost to the second player in a game because of the first mover advantage chess has.
2010-10-05T12:25:35  <Janzert> on the other hand the winner is always fed to bayeselo as the first player

2010-10-05T12:39:00  <anoek> meh
2010-10-05T12:41:28  <jmcarthur> Janzert: you mean you think the server is not hurting the rank of the loser as much as it should?

2010-10-05T12:42:53  <Janzert> That's what I was thinking, but now I'm pretty sure it is in fact ok. There is no first mover advantage by default, it's just something that can be set.
2010-10-05T12:43:05  <Janzert> in bayeselo that is
2010-10-05T12:44:41  <Janzert> I'm now trying to find an old post by the bayeselo author that explained many of the options and what he considered the best way to use it

2010-10-05T12:47:26  <jmcarthur> Janzert: what do you think of my suggestion on the ticket by the way? to show the mean and range rather than the mean and distances from the mean?
2010-10-05T12:47:26  <Janzert> hmm, the default confidence intervals are not terribly accurate
2010-10-05T12:47:28  <Janzert> http://talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?topic_view=threads&p=306627&t=30677
2010-10-05T12:48:35  <Janzert> that makes sense to me, the only reservation I have is it doesn't seem to be the "standard" way to present the intervals
2010-10-05T12:49:13  <Janzert> but I'm leaning towards it given the usefullness of it
2010-10-05T12:49:41  <jmcarthur> "In general, it is not a good idea to infer anything from confidence intervals when trying to compare two programs. Use LOS is better. "
2010-10-05T12:49:45  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure what to take out of that
2010-10-05T12:49:55  <jmcarthur> not sure what LOS is, either way.
2010-10-05T12:50:15  <Janzert> this was in a discussion testing changes to chess programs
2010-10-05T12:50:15  <jmcarthur> oh likelihood of superiority
2010-10-05T12:50:19  <Janzert> yeah
2010-10-05T12:50:42  <Janzert> so it's better to decide if your change is an improvement by using the LOS
2010-10-05T12:50:53  <jmcarthur> i see

2010-10-05T12:51:10  <jmcarthur> things like this are why i really really want tarballs from the server
2010-10-05T12:51:41  <jmcarthur> stuff that it may be impractical for the site to show, but would still be occasionally useful or interesting
2010-10-05T12:51:49  <Janzert> yeah

2010-10-05T12:52:19  <Janzert> I started to work on that then decided displaying CI's was more immediately useful... and probably easier to do as well :)
2010-10-05T12:52:46  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-10-05T12:53:12  <Janzert> so I'm thinking that we should feed bayeselo "exactdist" as well before we start displaying the intervals on the site
2010-10-05T12:53:27  <jmcarthur> that may be a good idea
2010-10-05T12:53:54  <Janzert> I have a feeling the covariance method will be to expensive to use
2010-10-05T12:54:46  <jmcarthur> yeah, n^3
2010-10-05T12:55:06  <jmcarthur> actually, n is only in number of players, not in number of games
2010-10-05T12:55:11  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure how expensive that would be
2010-10-05T12:55:19  <Janzert> hmm, maybe
2010-10-05T12:55:45  <jmcarthur> maybe a local test can crack this
2010-10-05T12:56:50  <Janzert> I think I'll add a note in the source and maybe danielvf can test it on the server to see what the actual cost is
2010-10-05T12:57:50  <Janzert> so in the rankings showing <lower> <mean> <upper> is probably best
2010-10-05T12:58:18  <jmcarthur> i do think that would be the most immediately informative
2010-10-05T12:58:19  <Janzert> what do you think about the profile page? show +/- or upper/lower?
2010-10-05T12:58:32  <jmcarthur> does the profile page even show elo score?
2010-10-05T12:58:42  <Janzert> I added that yes
2010-10-05T12:58:44  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-10-05T12:58:45  <jmcarthur> nice
2010-10-05T12:59:10  <jmcarthur> on the profile page i would probably show it the same way
2010-10-05T12:59:20  <Janzert> also called it estimated elo so it would hopefully help give people the idea that it isn't an exact score
2010-10-05T12:59:23  <contestbot> Top 10 players: ruilov(3878), cfaftw(3842), davidjliu(3838), Hazard(3821), dmj111(3783), felixcoto(3754), Arekku(3728), rsergio(3693), sequoh(3678), DocBot(3662)
2010-10-05T13:00:05  <jmcarthur> Janzert: do you know what the oppo. column in ratings.txt is?
2010-10-05T13:00:18  <Janzert> average elo of opponents
2010-10-05T13:00:22  <jmcarthur> ah!
2010-10-05T13:00:31  <jmcarthur> now it makes sense
2010-10-05T13:02:19  <Janzert> heh, now that I look at it "exactdist" used to be fed to bayeselo but is commented out with the note "we don't really need this", which is true as long as the confidence intervals aren't being used
2010-10-05T13:02:19  <jmcarthur> hmm... i want a way to sort the leaderboard by different criteria now
2010-10-05T13:02:34  <jmcarthur> ha!
2010-10-05T13:03:20  <jmcarthur> now that we will have a patch to show the lower confidence bound and stuff, if we could sort the leaderboard by whatever column we want then i could finally have my "rank by lower confidence bound" idea without imposing it on anybody else
2010-10-05T13:03:47  <Janzert> ooh, yeah. I hadn't thought of that
2010-10-05T13:06:02  <amstan> anyone here know redditalien? the bot?
2010-10-05T13:06:13  <amstan> they stole my error message! from contestbot, the one with dave!
2010-10-05T13:06:29  <amstan> well.. i'm not mad, i just wanna know if they have any association with us

2010-10-05T13:09:48  <amstan> maybe it's just coincidence

2010-10-05T13:10:09  <jmcarthur> i've seen other bots say that

2010-10-05T13:29:48  <Janzert> hmm, I'm not sure what the best/most intuitive way to display the actual upper and lower bounds on the profile page is. Using the +/- interval is fairly obvious with "Estimated Elo: 1234 (+123/-123)", maybe "Estimated Elo (lower/mean/upper): 1111/1234/1345"?
2010-10-05T13:30:14  <Janzert> but that still looks rather ugly
2010-10-05T13:30:25  <Meatkat> Will the +/- always be the same?
2010-10-05T13:30:30  <Janzert> no
2010-10-05T13:30:58  <Janzert> especially as you get to the top and bottom of the rankings
2010-10-05T13:31:10  <Meatkat> Right
2010-10-05T13:31:46  <Meatkat> "Estimated Elo (l/m/u) : 1111/1234/1345"?
2010-10-05T13:31:56  <jmcarthur> i wish we could show a little box and whisker plot
2010-10-05T13:32:18  <jmcarthur> with the mean written to the side or something
2010-10-05T13:32:33  <Janzert> Meatkat: think anyone will really understand l/m/u without having it explained?

2010-10-05T13:42:07  <Janzert> hmm, I'll play with it a bit
2010-10-05T13:42:17  <jmcarthur> or are you not really testing?
2010-10-05T13:42:20  <Janzert> sure

2010-10-05T14:07:32  <jmcarthur> Janzert: mean is the usual term for it, but i don't know if that word still applies with non-symmetric bounds
2010-10-05T14:07:48  <jmcarthur> it is usually true when it's a normal probability distribution
2010-10-05T14:08:04  <area> maximum likelihood?
2010-10-05T14:08:19  <jmcarthur> that seems accurate, but a bit of a mouthful
2010-10-05T14:08:27  <jmcarthur> most likely?
2010-10-05T14:08:37  <Janzert> yeah, accurate but a little long for a tooltip
2010-10-05T14:08:41  <Migi32> jmcarthur, is it not a normal probability distribution?
2010-10-05T14:08:54  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i don't think it is once we are computing non-symmetric confidence bounds
2010-10-05T14:09:10  * Janzert needs something that fits in between Lower/blah/Upper :)
2010-10-05T14:09:51  <Migi32> I seem to remember something like "greatest likelihood estimation"
2010-10-05T14:09:52  <Janzert> sticking with Mean might be best even though it's not quite right
2010-10-05T14:10:00  <jmcarthur> Lower/Guess/Upper
2010-10-05T14:10:02  <Migi32> but that's too long of a name
2010-10-05T14:10:06  <jmcarthur> Lower/Estimate/Upper
2010-10-05T14:10:15  <Migi32> yeah
2010-10-05T14:10:24  <Migi32> if you can't call it mean call it estimate
2010-10-05T14:11:17  <Janzert> that might be better although of course all 3 are estimates
2010-10-05T14:12:28  <jmcarthur> Janzert: http://i.imgur.com/5Vabz.png
2010-10-05T14:12:32  <Migi32> well, if anyone will complain about the inaccuracy of the term he should have a better name
2010-10-05T14:12:58  <boegel> Migi32: little progress with your bot? :)
2010-10-05T14:13:07  <Janzert> jmcarthur: sweet
2010-10-05T14:13:08  <jmcarthur> Janzert: of course those are high scores and i set the range of that plot to 0-3000, so they are kind of small
2010-10-05T14:13:22  <jmcarthur> and i set it to 100 pixels wide
2010-10-05T14:13:30  <jmcarthur> not sure if that is too wide or twoo narrow
2010-10-05T14:13:33  <jmcarthur> *too
2010-10-05T14:14:04  <Janzert> not sure either
2010-10-05T14:14:09  <Migi32> boegel, still coding utility functions, but in my mind my bot has made great progress
2010-10-05T14:14:25  <cfaftw> migi32, have you submitted yet? what's your bot's name?
2010-10-05T14:14:51  <jmcarthur> we could always set the range dynamically (via php), so we can be sure not to make it too big or two small in that sense
2010-10-05T14:14:55  <boegel> Migi32: but, have you tested it!
2010-10-05T14:15:03  <jmcarthur> but i am not sure about the rendering width

2010-10-05T14:15:18  <Janzert> on another note I found that you can have bayeselo anchor the elo and wonder if we should change to an anchor with the lowest elo being 0 or 100 instead of just adding 2000 to all of them
2010-10-05T14:15:32  <jmcarthur> Janzert: that would be awesome and i fully support that
2010-10-05T14:15:40  <jmcarthur> i hate the artificial score inflation
2010-10-05T14:15:46  <Janzert> yeah

2010-10-05T14:16:40  <Migi32> boegel, since I can't use many libraries there are a lot of functions/classes I have to program myself
2010-10-05T14:16:42  <Janzert> I think I would still want to see the numbers
2010-10-05T14:16:50  <jmcarthur> maybe the numbers could be a tooltip?
2010-10-05T14:16:51  <cfaftw> migi32, what language?
2010-10-05T14:16:52  <Migi32> I'm currently working on a simplex algorithm
2010-10-05T14:16:55  <Migi32> c++
2010-10-05T14:17:07  <Janzert> the plots do add a nice at a glance understanding

2010-10-05T14:17:33  <jmcarthur> yeah that would be nice

2010-10-05T14:18:57  <Janzert> hmm, just realised I should change the database to store the upper/lower bound instead of +/- so it can be an easy sort later
2010-10-05T14:20:22  <Migi32> boegel, oh it was thursday? I don't have classes on thursday, and I don't have a "kot" (what's the English for that?) in Ghent...

2010-10-05T14:21:43  <jmcarthur> Janzert: the nice thing about the plot is when you can actually see how good an estimate is. it may even be as useful as sorting by lower bound when it's easy to see visually: http://i.imgur.com/bTGU4.png
2010-10-05T14:22:23  <jmcarthur> heh i intended for testplayer2 to actually have a lower lower bound than testplayer3 in that, but i didn't set it low enough
2010-10-05T14:23:00  <Janzert> :)
2010-10-05T14:23:24  <Migi32> jmcarthur, I would draw a 1px black border around that, and also a line indicating the mean ELO

2010-10-05T14:31:09  <prowler> its a common topic i guess on the forum
2010-10-05T14:31:14  <boegel> Migi32: 30 is *a lot* though
2010-10-05T14:32:13  <justin_pdx> prowler: What do you mean "
2010-10-05T14:32:19  <justin_pdx> to bug an issue" ?
2010-10-05T14:32:35  <prowler> well it seems that some times games just randomly stop
2010-10-05T14:32:46  <justin_pdx> That is usually bad input.
2010-10-05T14:32:46  <prowler> i dont see any mention of timeout or invalid commands
2010-10-05T14:32:47  <Migi32> boegel, oh so it's more something for people who already are FP experts rather than to convince people into using FP?
2010-10-05T14:33:04  <justin_pdx> You either: sent an order for zero ships, sent more ships than a planet had in a turn, or sent ships to yourself.
2010-10-05T14:33:04  <prowler> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5486971
2010-10-05T14:33:09  <justin_pdx> That's usually what does it for me.
2010-10-05T14:33:21  <justin_pdx> Or sent ships FROM a planet you didn't own.
2010-10-05T14:33:25  <prowler> humm i have checks for all of that

2010-10-05T14:33:34  <boegel> Migi32: I'm by no means an expert

2010-10-05T14:35:02  <justin_pdx> Benzedrine is more strict than your local parser, too.  For example, the playgame in the starter package allows you to send ships to yourself and issue orders for zero ships.

2010-10-05T14:36:02  <justin_pdx> Cool, well if you lose it will have an I or D next to your loss to tell you if it was a disconnect or invalid input.
2010-10-05T14:36:26  <justin_pdx> But a game stop like that is DEFINITELY invalid input.

2010-10-05T14:42:10  <Janzert> yeah
2010-10-05T14:42:52  <Janzert> would it be hard to scale it by the highest and lowest values on the page?
2010-10-05T14:43:39  <Janzert> if they can't be derived in the script easily the php should be able to supply them
2010-10-05T14:43:47  <jmcarthur> that would just need to be added to the php, yeah
2010-10-05T14:44:01  <jmcarthur> i personally think i'd rather it be scaled by all bot scores though
2010-10-05T14:44:23  <irchs> hhmmmm.... does it bother anyone else that you can just crash out whilst you are ahead and win?

2010-10-05T14:46:43  <irchs> So ben issued an invalid order and won the game
2010-10-05T14:47:02  <irchs> Does it go on ships total or on ships on a planet?
2010-10-05T14:47:07  <justin_pdx> That's weird.

2010-10-05T14:47:28  <justin_pdx> The crasher won.
2010-10-05T14:47:29  <Janzert> but the visualizer shows the wrong name for invalid orders

2010-10-05T15:02:24  <bhasker> irchs: use the c++ visualizer
2010-10-05T15:02:33  <bhasker> its much faster and lighter
2010-10-05T15:02:57  <cfaftw> man my bot sucks at choosing planets to attack -__
2010-10-05T15:02:59  <cfaftw> -_-
2010-10-05T15:03:00  <bhasker> and i rewrote the basic bots in python so that i don't have to deal with Java
2010-10-05T15:03:08  <bhasker> welcome to the club cfat
2010-10-05T15:03:15  <bhasker> i need to fix my turn 1 logic
2010-10-05T15:03:22  <bhasker> my current heuristic is horrible
2010-10-05T15:03:29  <bhasker> going to change it into a 0-1 knapsack
2010-10-05T15:03:44  <bhasker> midgame it still does a decent job of selecting planets
2010-10-05T15:03:49  <cfaftw> what's a 0-1 knapsack?
2010-10-05T15:04:05  <emtles> someone writing in perl? i have a problem with getting fleet's destination
2010-10-05T15:04:18  <cfaftw> my bot is actually worse with end-game decisions...
2010-10-05T15:04:23  <bhasker> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem
2010-10-05T15:04:35  <cfaftw> meaning, i'll ahve more ships and more planets
2010-10-05T15:04:38  <cfaftw> then it does something dumb
2010-10-05T15:04:59  <bhasker> happens sometimes to my bot too, basically would send ships to acquire neutral ^
2010-10-05T15:05:01  <bhasker> and die
2010-10-05T15:05:16  <bhasker> so i have added a few checks to not do stuff like that
2010-10-05T15:05:30  <bhasker> and sometimes my heuristics will overestimate the number of ships i can send out
2010-10-05T15:05:42  <bhasker> and bot will send out a few more than i should and lose a critical planet
2010-10-05T15:06:01  <cfaftw> definitely the most difficult heuristic is "how many ships do i have available"
2010-10-05T15:06:13  <bhasker> well i do a few things to calculat ethat
2010-10-05T15:06:20  <cfaftw> ditto
2010-10-05T15:06:23  <cfaftw> but it's still hard to balance
2010-10-05T15:06:26  <bhasker> a) is the planet under attack, if no then its much simple
2010-10-05T15:06:30  <prowler> you need to get the .. send out what I can send based upon what's attacking me in the future.. working
2010-10-05T15:06:50  <bhasker> well you need to take care also of how many enemy ships are parked close to you
2010-10-05T15:07:01  <cfaftw> bhasker, yeah that's the hard part
2010-10-05T15:07:01  <bhasker> and how many can you expect to get from your planets in the time the enemy sends his ships at you
2010-10-05T15:07:02  <prowler> you should be able to be under constant attack and keep the planet at 0 without losing it
2010-10-05T15:07:19  <bhasker> well prowler that is easy when enemy is streaming ships at you
2010-10-05T15:07:28  <bhasker> but some bots don't do that
2010-10-05T15:07:35  <bhasker> they send a huge attack all of a sudden
2010-10-05T15:07:49  <prowler> right.. i take into account the 'planet future'
2010-10-05T15:07:51  <cfaftw> look at this loss to hazard
2010-10-05T15:07:53  <prowler> and if I'll lose it..
2010-10-05T15:07:53  <bhasker> that is a hard one to counter
2010-10-05T15:07:53  <cfaftw> http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5486684
2010-10-05T15:08:01  <prowler> then it becomes another planet that needs to be attacked etc
2010-10-05T15:08:05  <cfaftw> i had the advantage
2010-10-05T15:08:19  <cfaftw> but i underestimate the threat of his two largest planets
2010-10-05T15:08:31  <bhasker> your mistake was to go after a middle planet
2010-10-05T15:08:37  <bhasker> what i do to prevent that now is
2010-10-05T15:08:41  <bhasker> i queue up orders
2010-10-05T15:08:48  <bhasker> and if there are closer planets than the one i am attacking
2010-10-05T15:08:50  <bhasker> i cancel the order
2010-10-05T15:08:58  <cfaftw> is it alwasy a mistake, though?
2010-10-05T15:09:04  <bhasker> in most cases yes
2010-10-05T15:09:06  <cfaftw> going for a middle planet has actually won me games
2010-10-05T15:09:14  <bhasker> well not in the middle of 7 of his
2010-10-05T15:09:17  <bhasker> and yours so far
2010-10-05T15:09:17  <cfaftw> (not that i specifically target middle planets... it just happens sometimes)
2010-10-05T15:10:05  <bhasker> he can reinforce it much faster than you can
2010-10-05T15:10:14  <bhasker> so unless you send a really really big force
2010-10-05T15:10:18  <bhasker> and capture 2-3 at the same time
2010-10-05T15:10:24  <bhasker> or within next 2-3 turns
2010-10-05T15:10:29  <bhasker> you won't be able to hold it
2010-10-05T15:10:33  <cfaftw> true
2010-10-05T15:10:57  <cfaftw> but the realy problem there was i overestimated how many ships i could send and still have that planet be safe
2010-10-05T15:11:01  <cfaftw> real*
2010-10-05T15:11:05  <bhasker> yes thats true
2010-10-05T15:11:51  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=324181
2010-10-05T15:11:55  <bhasker> my bot doing dumb stuff
2010-10-05T15:12:06  <bhasker> at turn 34 we are roughly even
2010-10-05T15:12:27  <cfaftw> yeah
2010-10-05T15:12:28  <bhasker> at rather at  turn 24 ish
2010-10-05T15:12:35  <bhasker> my bot decided to take 3 neutrals at the same time
2010-10-05T15:12:38  <bhasker> and burnt 200 ships
2010-10-05T15:12:40  <bhasker> ...
2010-10-05T15:12:52  <bhasker> setting it at a disadvantage of 50% in ships
2010-10-05T15:13:09  <bhasker> need to add some checks so that it doesn't commit more than a certain fraction at any time to acquiring neutrals midgame
2010-10-05T15:13:28  <bhasker> right now its greedy
2010-10-05T15:13:33  <bhasker> it just takes it if it can
2010-10-05T15:13:56  <cfaftw> actually, the main mistake there looks like it has to do with the first planet of yours that he takes
2010-10-05T15:14:30  <cfaftw> looks like it was abandoned
2010-10-05T15:15:44  <cfaftw> actually, haha
2010-10-05T15:15:48  <Frontier> cfaftw: Just looked at that match. Yeah it was interesting to see. I really wonder what my bot would have done there. How can I check that?
2010-10-05T15:15:48  <cfaftw> you're right about the neutral planet thing
2010-10-05T15:16:00  <cfaftw> you went for the center planet... that was a mistake
2010-10-05T15:16:18  <cfaftw> frontier, you mean my match against hazard?
2010-10-05T15:17:37  <cfaftw> frontier, and how can you check what?
2010-10-05T15:17:49  <Frontier> exactly. You are rank 4 and still your bot has some funny flaws.
2010-10-05T15:18:16  <Frontier> I'd like to check how my bot would have decided in this situation
2010-10-05T15:18:42  <Frontier> Can I put the replay in a map file or something?

2010-10-05T15:21:28  <cfaftw> frontier, the map data is in the page source... you can easilly convert it to a regular map file
2010-10-05T15:21:28  <Janzert> looks nice
2010-10-05T15:21:41  <Frontier> But how do I get it out of the JavaScript mangling into something readable ^^?
2010-10-05T15:22:31  <cfaftw> i copy/paste, then replace all ':' with '\n', all ',' with ' ' and put a 'P
2010-10-05T15:22:34  <cfaftw> 'P
2010-10-05T15:22:40  <cfaftw> 'P ' at the beginning of each line
2010-10-05T15:23:00  <cfaftw> use a regex replace, replace '^' with 'P '
2010-10-05T15:23:16  <jmcarthur> i won't bother writing a proper patch until we actually have the necessary data in the database
2010-10-05T15:23:44  <jmcarthur> unless you want to just include it with your branch, Janzert... but i have a feeling you'd still rather stick with the raw numbers
2010-10-05T15:23:52  <Frontier> And will that expand it to a complete maps (planets fleets) for each round?

2010-10-05T15:28:38  <Frontier> a mock bot? You use replays to debug your bot or did I get that wrong?
2010-10-05T15:29:08  <bhasker> Frontier there is a python script
2010-10-05T15:29:12  <bhasker> that can take the url of the page
2010-10-05T15:29:16  <bhasker> and feed the map data to your bot
2010-10-05T15:29:28  <bhasker> so you can see how your bot will react.

2010-10-05T15:38:20  <Arekku> if I have spare ships and the planet is closer to me

2010-10-05T15:40:58  <bhasker> where it does stupid stuff?
2010-10-05T15:41:05  <Arekku> yep
2010-10-05T15:41:09  <cfaftw> the problem with neutrals is that you can often expect others to snipe them
2010-10-05T15:41:16  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=324411
2010-10-05T15:41:28  <bhasker> i overcommitted ships
2010-10-05T15:41:31  <bhasker> to acquiring neutrals
2010-10-05T15:41:35  <bhasker> which shifted the balance to the enemy
2010-10-05T15:41:43  <bhasker> i was actually leading
2010-10-05T15:41:47  <bhasker> and bam it reversed
2010-10-05T15:42:21  <bhasker> and my planet selection strategy is certainly not optimal
2010-10-05T15:42:24  <bhasker> it went for a 1 growth planet
2010-10-05T15:42:32  <bhasker> with 60 ships
2010-10-05T15:42:45  <cfaftw> i generally try to keep my bot from going for neutrals in the demilitarized zone
2010-10-05T15:42:47  <justin_pdx> You snagged the wrong neutrals, yeah, that growth_rate 1 planet was a poor choice.
2010-10-05T15:42:49  <bhasker> instead of the 58 with 2 growth 4-5 turns away
2010-10-05T15:43:05  <bhasker> or heck even the 71
2010-10-05T15:43:09  <bhasker> as i said my bot is a bit greedy
2010-10-05T15:43:18  <bhasker> if there is a planet that it can acquire it doesn't hold back
2010-10-05T15:43:22  <bhasker> it will send ships to acquire it
2010-10-05T15:43:23  <justin_pdx> The 77 and the 71 near your home were much better choices.

2010-10-05T15:43:46  <bhasker> or something
2010-10-05T15:44:45  <jmcarthur> there must be a ton of inlining going on here:  Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) = 235  ...  cabal build  10.59s user 0.47s system 99% cpu 11.121 total  ...  33M -rwxr-xr-x 1 jake users 33M Oct  5 14:35 dist/build/planet-wars-jmcarthur/planet-wars-jmcarthur
2010-10-05T15:45:11  <Arekku> yeah
2010-10-05T15:45:22  <Arekku> about the same change I tried to implement
2010-10-05T15:45:42  <Arekku> unfortunately it blew WAY above the time limit
2010-10-05T15:46:01  <Arekku> so I had to restore my backup
2010-10-05T15:46:10  <cfaftw> arekku, really?
2010-10-05T15:47:08  <Arekku> well I did a really stupid implementation of it with a order 4 or so algorithm
2010-10-05T15:47:20  <cfaftw> so far i haven't come anywhere close to the time limit
2010-10-05T15:47:35  <cfaftw> and i have a LOT of o(n^2) loops
2010-10-05T15:47:49  <cfaftw> some n^3
2010-10-05T15:47:51  <Arekku> either that or extremely buggy code (ie infinitive loops)
2010-10-05T15:48:22  <bhasker> hmm my code is python
2010-10-05T15:48:26  <bhasker> and it take less than 300ms per turn
2010-10-05T15:48:51  <Arekku> I guess it could be reserving 0 ships for a mission
2010-10-05T15:48:51  <Migi32> cfaftw, I have an O(n^5) loop and I'm fine
2010-10-05T15:49:01  <Arekku> fine, but I'm a smeghead :D
2010-10-05T15:49:35  <justin_pdx> My bot takes > 5 or 6 seconds per turn.  I'm working on paring that down.
2010-10-05T15:49:44  <bhasker> 5-6 seconds??
2010-10-05T15:49:55  <bhasker> are you doing like a game tree search or something
2010-10-05T15:49:56  <rabidus> lol :D
2010-10-05T15:49:58  <bhasker> thats a lot of time per turn
2010-10-05T15:49:58  <justin_pdx> I need to cache common lookups, like planet distances.
2010-10-05T15:50:08  <rabidus> wtf
2010-10-05T15:50:11  <Migi32> that takes like 0.01 seconds
2010-10-05T15:50:15  <Migi32> at most
2010-10-05T15:50:19  <rabidus> that takes like 0.0000000000000001 seconds
2010-10-05T15:50:25  <cfaftw> woowwwww
2010-10-05T15:50:51  <justin_pdx> Yeah but if you do it for every planet for every OTHER planet, 20 times, it adds up.
2010-10-05T15:50:53  <Zannick> ouch

2010-10-05T15:51:09  <bhasker> why recompute
2010-10-05T15:51:13  <bhasker> its static for next 200 turns
2010-10-05T15:51:14  <justin_pdx> Laziness.
2010-10-05T15:51:21  <rabidus> every planet distance to every planet is still under 0.0000000001 seconds, really
2010-10-05T15:51:24  <justin_pdx> I don't care about computation time right now.
2010-10-05T15:51:25  <rabidus> depends language tho
2010-10-05T15:51:36  <cfaftw> mine's in python
2010-10-05T15:51:45  <cfaftw> each turn takes about 15ms
2010-10-05T15:51:47  <jmcarthur> did you actually profile for this?
2010-10-05T15:51:50  <Zannick> my first turn takes 1.3 seconds or so
2010-10-05T15:51:52  <Arekku> oh, I speak python! hssss hssss sssss
2010-10-05T15:51:58  <Zannick> when i repeat it several million times
2010-10-05T15:52:03  <cfaftw> usually my elapsed time is 0ms
2010-10-05T15:52:18  <justin_pdx> I actually should profile.
2010-10-05T15:52:19  <amstan> Arekku: del snake.sound
2010-10-05T15:52:24  <jmcarthur> i will be taking the full 1 sec per turn, hopefully no more and no less
2010-10-05T15:52:30  <justin_pdx> I wonder where I spend all my time.
2010-10-05T15:52:35  <cfaftw> (of course, we're all using very different system configurations)
2010-10-05T15:52:39  <jmcarthur> of course, i will have to make it less to be safe :\
2010-10-05T15:52:44  <Arekku> browsing pr0n?
2010-10-05T15:52:51  <cfaftw> justin_pdx, maybe your bot is actually smart :)
2010-10-05T15:52:54  <rabidus> 5-6 seconds.... sick
2010-10-05T15:52:55  <Migi32> perhaps I will provide my c++ comrades with a c++ starter package that already caches all the common things
2010-10-05T15:52:58  <bhasker> hmm actually i might need to fix a few things
2010-10-05T15:53:04  <bhasker> mine is taking now close to 800ms total
2010-10-05T15:53:07  <bhasker> by mid game
2010-10-05T15:53:20  <Migi32> and doesn't copy-construct every planet whenever you call pw.Planets()
2010-10-05T15:53:32  <justin_pdx> I think my bot is pretty smart.  It can play in under a second if I reduce the maximum look-forward.
2010-10-05T15:53:54  <justin_pdx> Also, the maps in the example map directory don't match the server maps.  Where do I get the server map package?
2010-10-05T15:54:08  <Arekku> justin_pdx: I think my bot is retarded :P
2010-10-05T15:54:25  <justin_pdx> The maps in the starter packages are bigger, it seems, than the server maps, am I wrong?
2010-10-05T15:54:52  <cfaftw> justin_pdx, it varies
2010-10-05T15:55:14  <cfaftw> they seem to all be cut from the same mold...
2010-10-05T15:55:14  <justin_pdx> I code in ruby so I imagine I'm already at an itty bitty runspeed disadvantage over c++ etc.
2010-10-05T15:55:27  <jmcarthur> itty bitty? :P
2010-10-05T15:55:45  <justin_pdx> Yeah, itty bitty.
2010-10-05T15:55:48  <justin_pdx> :p
2010-10-05T15:55:57  <Arekku> java ftw :D
2010-10-05T15:56:05  <jmcarthur> ruby has one of the slowest interpreters i know of :P
2010-10-05T15:56:20  <jmcarthur> java has an awesome VM. too bad its warmup time is so long
2010-10-05T15:56:23  <bhasker> java blows
2010-10-05T15:56:29  <bhasker> takes forever to load
2010-10-05T15:56:30  <jmcarthur> i hate java the language
2010-10-05T15:56:32  <bhasker> annoying as hell
2010-10-05T15:56:43  <Arekku> yeah well the tutorial is for java
2010-10-05T15:56:44  <bhasker> and yes the language is not very nice either
2010-10-05T15:56:54  <jmcarthur> it is my opinion that java makes for poor interactive programs
2010-10-05T15:57:00  <bhasker> i am writing in python for now, if when i start hitting timeouts i will recode it in c++

2010-10-05T15:57:53  <Migi32> no you won't :P
2010-10-05T15:58:05  <justin_pdx> Is there a spec for what kind of hardware the server is running?
2010-10-05T15:58:22  <justin_pdx> So we can guess at runspeeds?
2010-10-05T15:58:28  <jmcarthur> but i don't think it will be a big problem this time. in the tron contest i was trying to make a point that haskell could run nearly as fast as c. i think i showed that. this time, i'm also certain to reach the same goal
2010-10-05T15:58:37  <justin_pdx> Is it more powerful than my laptop or not?
2010-10-05T15:58:45  <Arekku> probably
2010-10-05T15:58:46  <Migi32> justin_pdx, there was. Let me scroll up and see if I can find it back.
2010-10-05T15:58:47  <jmcarthur> i worked hard in the tron contest to do that. i think it won't be as much work this time if i can use GHC HEAD
2010-10-05T15:58:53  <cfaftw> at my job, our server code-base is all python and C, but we will be refactoring soon and my supervisor really wants to do it all in java

2010-10-05T16:02:02  <Migi32> cftawtw, I share your dislike for Java. Imho, any programming language that doesn't offer multiple inheritance is not worth looking at :P
2010-10-05T16:02:11  <jmcarthur> o_O
2010-10-05T16:02:45  <Migi32> you can o_O me all you want until you find a case where you'll actually need multiple inheritance.
2010-10-05T16:02:51  <jmcarthur> i think multiple inheritance is a bad solution to a real problem. language without a solution to that problem claim it does not exist, and C++ just mutilates it :P
2010-10-05T16:02:58  <cfaftw> haha, that's... not the reason i don't like java
2010-10-05T16:03:36  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i can tell you all kinds of such cases. i just don't like multiple inheritance as a solution
2010-10-05T16:03:45  <Janzert> java is too much like a straitjacket
2010-10-05T16:03:51  <jmcarthur> it's only needed because the language is retarded in other ways
2010-10-05T16:04:11  <Janzert> other than that it's a fine language, just don't make me use it :P
2010-10-05T16:04:15  <justin_pdx> I dislike java cause it's very clunky with things that should be easy, like sorting an array.
2010-10-05T16:04:35  <jmcarthur> yeah, nothing quite like [a,b,c].sort  or  sort [a,b,c]
2010-10-05T16:04:48  <justin_pdx> Iterators and parsers and extra objects, and collections, and buffers and blah blah blah.
2010-10-05T16:04:57  <Arekku> Janzert: Agreed
2010-10-05T16:05:01  <justin_pdx> jmcarthur: Exactly.
2010-10-05T16:05:50  <jmcarthur> i have no problem with the existence of iterators and parsers and extra objects, and collections, and buffers

2010-10-05T16:05:56  <Migi32> I have to std::binary_sort(my_array.begin(), my_array.end()); but having to type much is not a reason to dislike a language
2010-10-05T16:06:04  <jmcarthur> i just don't think java provides good interfaces for them
2010-10-05T16:06:16  <jmcarthur> and i don't like that java requires you to write them out fully for every single little thing
2010-10-05T16:06:35  <jmcarthur> Migi32: yeah, having to read much is a better reason ;)
2010-10-05T16:07:14  <Migi32> what really was a deal-breaker for Java was the fact that an interface has to know all the types of exceptions any of its implementations can throw
2010-10-05T16:07:25  <jmcarthur> that's not true
2010-10-05T16:07:30  <Migi32> it's not?
2010-10-05T16:07:34  <jmcarthur> that's only true for checked exceptions

2010-10-05T16:10:48  <Migi32> did the Tron contest do that?
2010-10-05T16:10:54  <jmcarthur> it did for a little while on the tcp server for the tron one
2010-10-05T16:11:02  <cfaftw> you can figure out what other bots are doing just by watching, but only to a limited extent

2010-10-05T16:13:06  <Frontier> I like Java. It is an easy to learn and read language. That's why supervisors love it. Practically everyone uses the same code style.
2010-10-05T16:13:16  <jmcarthur> easy to learn. not, IMO, easy to read
2010-10-05T16:13:27  <Janzert> my thought right now is if we don't show columns for upper and lower bound then clicking on the elo column would toggle through elo, lower bound and upper bound
2010-10-05T16:13:58  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-10-05T16:14:35  <jmcarthur> i suppose that could work
2010-10-05T16:15:22  <Frontier> jmcarthur: Compared to C code with lots of macros and conditional defines it is easy to read. But they introduced templates and annotations a while back so it becomes more and more obscure like any other language. ^^
2010-10-05T16:15:49  <jmcarthur> Frontier: C and Java are for very different domains though
2010-10-05T16:16:03  <jmcarthur> Frontier: and doesn't Java have generics, not templates?
2010-10-05T16:16:04  <Janzert> first though I really want to get started recording and displaying the bounds the rest is <frosting/gravy/sprinkles on top> :)
2010-10-05T16:16:13  <jmcarthur> Janzert: agreed
2010-10-05T16:16:41  <jmcarthur> i really want to see the whiskers on the leaderboard though. i've been secretly wanting that for a long time now
2010-10-05T16:16:56  <Frontier> jmcarthur: Right, Java cannot do as much as C++ with templates. I just tend to call them so.
2010-10-05T16:17:23  <Janzert> yeah, they will be cool

2010-10-05T16:17:32  <jmcarthur> generics and templates aren't really so bad semantically. they just suck syntactically in Java and C++
2010-10-05T16:17:47  <cfaftw> arekku, your bot has been gaining a lot of traction
2010-10-05T16:18:14  <Janzert> btw, feeding the javascript the highest and lowest values on the page in a hidden div after the table should be really simple.
2010-10-05T16:18:15  <Migi32> Frontier, no language can do as much as c++. Just look at the c++0x standard. I bet there are less than 100 people on this planet who know every detail of c++
2010-10-05T16:18:28  <Janzert> if that works for the javascript to get the values
2010-10-05T16:18:32  <Frontier> I also like how everything is an object in Java with no exception. That makes for some awesome features like arrays of classes, having methods as objects or constructors so you can pass them around
2010-10-05T16:18:44  <cfaftw> my current bot is going to slip to 5 or 6, most likely

2010-10-05T16:19:48  <Frontier> Migi32: I just tried to get a function pointer out of a share library... did you know you cannot do that with C++? You cant just cast the returned void* into a function pointer. It is rediculous ^^

2010-10-05T16:36:52  <jmcarthur> lovely how the parameter doesn't even specify the number to delete. what is it even for?
2010-10-05T16:37:12  <amstan> i actually ran the 100 2 times, then the 1000
2010-10-05T16:37:13  <Zannick> i assume that it does
2010-10-05T16:37:15  <Janzert> hehe, would a script that deletes all but say any users last 3 submissions be wanted?
2010-10-05T16:37:19  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-10-05T16:37:33  <jmcarthur> that would be pretty reasonable, Janzert
2010-10-05T16:38:04  <Naktibalda> wouldn't it better to have 1 directory per user, and keep only the latest submission here?
2010-10-05T16:38:33  <jmcarthur> even having a directory per user and keeping all of that user's submissions would be fine
2010-10-05T16:38:42  <jmcarthur> i doubt a user would upload 32000 submissions, after all
2010-10-05T16:38:51  <jmcarthur> although that could be a DOS maybe
2010-10-05T16:38:54  <Janzert> yes, but would require a lot of changes in the current code base
2010-10-05T16:39:04  <Zannick> you can't keep all of a user's submissions in one directory
2010-10-05T16:39:20  <Zannick> that either overwrites, or you have subdirectories

2010-10-05T17:53:48  <jmcarthur> i think it's because it's creating a fusion point in my code
2010-10-05T17:54:10  <jmcarthur> so all the intermediate loops between uses of that function are being fused into one
2010-10-05T17:55:01  <Sluf> I started on my loop, of a loop, of a loop of a loop, and thought to myself.. I should rethink this.
2010-10-05T17:55:15  <jmcarthur> heh, yeah, that happens
2010-10-05T17:55:35  <jmcarthur> ghc is handling this nested stuff for me. that's where the compilation overhead is coming from
2010-10-05T17:56:07  <jmcarthur> i'm saying "loop, then loop, then loop, then loop" and ghc is translating that into "loop of loop of loop of loop"
2010-10-05T17:56:56  <jmcarthur> or actually, i'm saying "loop a, then loop b, then loop c, then loop d" and ghc is tranlating is into "loop of a b c and d"
2010-10-05T17:57:13  <jmcarthur> and there are nested loops where needed
2010-10-05T17:57:23  <Zannick> when i was taught sml, i remember a series of functions that would take it exponentially long to determine the types of

2010-10-05T18:06:43  <sigh> there are plenty of code implementations around on the net

2010-10-05T18:09:40  <sigh> yeah, that would be best... assuming that you can get it compile on the contest servers
2010-10-05T18:09:51  <sigh> that's the main thing with libraries

2010-10-05T18:35:48  <Migi32> Zannick, what is duplex? Can't find much about it on google
2010-10-05T18:36:04  <Zannick> it's a method of printing on both sides of a piece of paper
2010-10-05T18:36:08  <Zannick> simplex uses only one side
2010-10-05T18:36:10  <Zannick> ;)
2010-10-05T18:36:26  <Migi32> haha :D
2010-10-05T18:36:30  <jmcarthur> so simplex is half duplex?
2010-10-05T18:36:37  <Migi32> that joke went totally over my head :P
2010-10-05T18:37:03  <Migi32> I was already reading the wikipedia on "Vedic duplex method for extracting a square root"
2010-10-05T18:37:09  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-10-05T18:37:12  <Zannick> simplex is duplex with every other page blank
2010-10-05T18:38:14  <jmcarthur> i guess i should be more honest. my search algorithm is tree search if you squint really really hard
2010-10-05T18:38:26  * sigh squints

2010-10-05T19:43:33  <amstan> so.. the functions work, they were tested..
2010-10-05T19:44:25  <jfrank> amstan: the first qry in addupdateorg is not an org query
2010-10-05T19:44:26  <cfaftw> how do you use that qtcp client with a python bot

2010-10-05T19:44:58  <jfrank> amstan: shouldnt the first of the two queries be select orgname....

2010-10-05T19:46:06  <amstan> copy and paste wrong.. anyway, now it should be fine
2010-10-05T19:46:09  <amstan> i'll be running that test
2010-10-05T19:46:28  <amstan> jfrank: k.. orgname searching works.. adding org was not tested..
2010-10-05T19:46:32  <amstan> but like.. it should kinda work..
2010-10-05T19:46:40  <amstan> well.. let's try it
2010-10-05T19:46:45  <amstan> jfrank: what's your org name?
2010-10-05T19:47:00  <jfrank> my new one is mentor graphics
2010-10-05T19:47:06  <jfrank> currently its waterloo

2010-10-05T19:48:48  <amstan> 244*
2010-10-05T19:49:23  <amstan> jfrank: k.. so.. can i run it then, was the rest of the script tested?
2010-10-05T19:50:06  <jfrank> i think the rest of the data should be good. there is the case that the username can't be found, which prints stuff, you'll have to not include that 'other issues'
2010-10-05T19:51:07  <amstan> there was an issue about special chars..
2010-10-05T19:51:09  <jfrank> in failure of lookup playerLookup returns None, which causes line 55 to not be that helpful

2010-10-05T20:02:01  <jfrank> i realized that, they can have typos. Obeleh is in that list though

2010-10-05T20:02:37  <jfrank> so some of those errors are real, but it looks like that function is not finding ids for real users, which is a problem

2010-10-05T21:00:14  <Frontier> Is anyone here running tests on all 100 maps agains the 5 starter bots?
2010-10-05T21:00:51  <sigh> Frontier: don't bother with anything otehr than rage and dual
2010-10-05T21:01:18  <sigh> I used to, but now I beat them all on all maps, so it is pointless
2010-10-05T21:01:30  <Frontier> How long did it take for one run?
2010-10-05T21:02:21  <sigh> I can run about 200 games a minute, that's parallel across 4 cores though and my bot uses hardly any time
2010-10-05T21:03:03  <sigh> the games don't run the full 200 turns either, so that helps :)
2010-10-05T21:03:27  <Frontier> 200 a minute with the java local server?
2010-10-05T21:03:34  <sigh> yup
2010-10-05T21:03:45  <sigh> on 2.83 GHz quad core
2010-10-05T21:05:24  <Frontier> crazy speed. for me it took around 15 minutes with all 5 bots i think
2010-10-05T21:06:02  <sigh> as I said, my bot doesn't use much time... it's getting slower though
2010-10-05T21:07:25  <sigh> if I run my bots against each other the games are often longer so they take more time
2010-10-05T21:07:33  <sigh> but still only a few seconds per game

2010-10-05T21:09:06  <Frontier> Well I have a notebook with a 2.0 Ghz dual core and just ran RageBot against itself and the other 4 on all maps in 1,4 seconds :)
2010-10-05T21:09:59  <Frontier> thats about 3ms per game ^^
2010-10-05T21:12:11  <Frontier> I rewrote the server and the bots in C++ and let them all run in one process and communicate directly through C++-objects without using stdout and stdin. That will be fun when I start to test different versions of my bot on all maps.

2010-10-05T21:29:04  <a1k0n> yes, PlayGame.jar is terrible
2010-10-05T21:29:10  <a1k0n> i use albert's C++ engine thing
2010-10-05T21:29:15  <Frontier> sigh: You contradict yourself ^^ - "I can run about 200 games a minute" - "only a few seconds per game"
2010-10-05T21:29:37  <sigh> 200 games is across 4 cores
2010-10-05T21:29:43  <Frontier> a1k0n: is it open source?
2010-10-05T21:29:49  <sigh> I mentioned that :P
2010-10-05T21:29:49  <a1k0n> yep, it's on the forum
2010-10-05T21:30:13  <Frontier> sigh: shame on me. I never get used to this parallel running stuff
2010-10-05T21:30:35  <sigh> haha... 200 games in series would be nice though :P
2010-10-05T21:30:40  <Frontier> When I look at the output of 'top' I never know if it is 40% of BOTH cpus or just one
2010-10-05T21:30:57  <sigh> parallel was easy, I'm just using a forking version of map I found on the net
2010-10-05T21:31:07  <sigh> (python)
2010-10-05T21:32:05  <Frontier> Ok, you can fork any shell script as well I guess and run 25 maps on each core or so.
2010-10-05T21:34:11  <Frontier> a1k0n: There is only one good thing about PlayGame.jar - it should run out of the box on most setups.

2010-10-05T23:44:41  <jmcarthur> sneilan: made by the galcon creator himself
2010-10-05T23:44:54  <Janzert> bleh, can't remember the passwords I used for the testaccounts on my test server :P
2010-10-05T23:45:44  <jmcarthur> sneilan: http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=3907
2010-10-05T23:46:31  <sneilan> yes, but, what i meant to say is if it's possible to replay matches in the galcon fusion game itself (not the java simulator). it looks cooler with all the graphics and all that
2010-10-05T23:48:03  <jmcarthur> ah i see
2010-10-05T23:48:09  <jmcarthur> i agree. i'm not sure
2010-10-05T23:48:28  <jmcarthur> sneilan: the canvas visualizer is pretty nice though
2010-10-05T23:50:02  <sneilan> it is and i'm fine with it. i was just curious if I could use galcon fusion as the visualizer instead, but, it looks like i can't
2010-10-05T23:52:31  <sneilan> thank you for your time tho!
2010-10-05T23:52:35  <Janzert> I've never heard of it being possible so I would assume it's probably not
2010-10-05T23:52:40  <Janzert> would be cool if it was though
