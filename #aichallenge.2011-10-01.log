2011-10-01T00:18:37  <McLeopold> howdy janzert
2011-10-01T00:18:59  <janzert> hey
2011-10-01T00:19:13  <McLeopold> so, just starting your saturday?
2011-10-01T00:20:02  <McLeopold> http://ants.zeroviz.us/eVWC5/
2011-10-01T00:20:10  <McLeopold> I'll be working on the map gen stuff tonight
2011-10-01T00:20:32  <McLeopold> I will probably put some new tables in the database to support keeping track of what has been generated
2011-10-01T00:20:33  <mleise> McLeopold: my first reaction was a smile
2011-10-01T00:20:34  <janzert> interesting
2011-10-01T00:21:22  <McLeopold> btw, that is not an indication of how many hills I want, just used them to show points for generating the voronoi :)
2011-10-01T00:21:41  <janzert> :)
2011-10-01T00:22:16  <McLeopold> I should also have the min/max distance between hills working tonight, so I'll be playing with acceptable param
2011-10-01T00:22:31  <McLeopold> If you have any more ideas on what they should be, let me know
2011-10-01T00:23:19  <mleise> I still hope someone will create a map editor
2011-10-01T00:23:46  <janzert> I was thinking about trying to get a map list page and also having it display number of games and game end types per map, maybe avg and median game lengths as well
2011-10-01T00:24:09  <janzert> so we could get a better overview on the difference between various maps
2011-10-01T00:24:09  <mleise> but compared to tron, the maps we have no are already much more diverse and interesting
2011-10-01T00:24:54  <mleise> *now
2011-10-01T00:28:38  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, I have the link, just no page yet :)
2011-10-01T00:29:36  <janzert> I noticed that and was excited until I tried it out ;)
2011-10-01T00:33:53  <mleise> :( http://ants.zeroviz.us/PaDyp/

2011-10-01T13:48:30  <UncleVasya> IsJAntManager going to be ready in few weeks? If so I'll say my friend who asking for a new version of AntsTesting to wait,  otherwise I'll do it for him.
2011-10-01T14:04:08  <delt0r_> UncleVasya: Wow just got of the train from one week in Germany only 5 min ago
2011-10-01T14:04:17  <delt0r_> so that was a quick ping
2011-10-01T14:04:51  <delt0r_> Unfortunatly probably not. I have a eye infection, and its slowing me down. Not even keeping up with work
2011-10-01T14:04:56  <UncleVasya> I'm lucky :)
2011-10-01T14:05:26  <delt0r_> I swear Okoberfest had nothing to do with it... Really it didn't --only had 2 mass
2011-10-01T14:06:12  <UncleVasya> sorry for your eyes :(
2011-10-01T14:07:30  <delt0r_> and crap --ants is now different
2011-10-01T14:07:39  <delt0r_> so i need to update the engine anyways
2011-10-01T14:11:20  <UncleVasya> Thanks for your response. Wish your eyes become healthy as soon as possible (not because of JAntManager).

2011-10-01T14:43:57  <delt0r_> well that cus there are no explosions
2011-10-01T14:44:17  <delt0r_> ask Michal Bay just how good that works
2011-10-01T14:44:25  <delt0r_> aka it really works
2011-10-01T14:45:04  <McLeopold> and beta was too long
2011-10-01T14:46:09  <UncleVasya> yep, the 2nd reason is that some guys (McLeopold) try to "even the battlefield between betatesters and new contestants".
2011-10-01T14:46:36  <McLeopold> plus, we thought the game was "broken"
2011-10-01T14:46:52  <McLeopold> the best strategy seemed to be to just spread out and avoid conflict
