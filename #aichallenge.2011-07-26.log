2011-07-26T11:55:52  <mcstar> bhasker: hi
2011-07-26T11:56:09  <bhasker> morning
2011-07-26T11:56:20  <mcstar> i need a filesystem advice
2011-07-26T11:57:04  <jbroman> mcstar: FAT16
2011-07-26T11:57:14  <mcstar> sorry, im not in the mood
2011-07-26T11:57:47  <mcstar> but yeah, fat16 is a nice option for digital cmaras
2011-07-26T11:57:52  <mcstar> cameras
2011-07-26T11:58:08  <jbroman> Seriously, though, on Linux ext4 seems fairly stable and modern. btrfs is fairly unstable from what I've heard, and the support behind the extX series can come in handy.
2011-07-26T11:58:39  <mcstar> at work, i booted my computer after close to half a year out of operation
2011-07-26T11:58:53  <mcstar> the xfs module died, xfs_check said there was error
2011-07-26T11:59:05  <mcstar> and basically hanged the system afterwards
2011-07-26T11:59:19  <mcstar> i preferred xfs in the past, but i think ill try something different
2011-07-26T12:00:04  <mcstar> what about reiser? jbroman
2011-07-26T12:00:22  <mcstar> isnt it a killer filesystem?
2011-07-26T12:01:22  <mcstar> its gonna be ext4 then

2011-07-26T12:06:56  <jbroman> mcstar: Reiser was good, but my impression is that it's less maintained nowadays. Haven't looked too closely recently, though.
2011-07-26T12:07:13  <jbroman> The differences between these filesystems is not a limiting factor for my use cases.
2011-07-26T12:07:39  <mcstar> my only requirement is reliability
2011-07-26T12:08:36  <jbroman> ext4 is probably good; ext3 if you want something older
2011-07-26T12:08:39  <mcstar> now i only have to decide whether i want a 1.5tb partition or split it
2011-07-26T12:08:54  <jbroman> mcstar: If Linux, you could do the LVM magics.
2011-07-26T12:09:09  <mcstar> yeah, but im lazy now
2011-07-26T12:09:15  <mcstar> id have to read about it
2011-07-26T12:09:45  <mcstar> ill have one big partition
