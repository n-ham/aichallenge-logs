2011-06-29T06:04:42  <antimatroid> aerique: just say what's happening"?
2011-06-29T06:04:54  <antimatroid> what moves are you making with the left and right b ant?
2011-06-29T06:04:59  <antimatroid> and what's happening?
2011-06-29T06:05:16  <antimatroid> giving me rows and columns on a grid i'm looking at doesn't really help :P
2011-06-29T06:05:21  <aerique> antimatroid: ants 14,11 and 13,11 collide (due to 14,11 moving north and 13,11 having newly spawned)
2011-06-29T06:05:29  <antimatroid> which ants, left and right
2011-06-29T06:05:39  <antimatroid> locations in a grid aren't helpful when i'm not a computer :P
2011-06-29T06:05:40  <aerique> antimatroid: right / b
2011-06-29T06:05:52  <aerique> antimatroid: they move left
2011-06-29T06:05:59  <aerique> antimatroid: towards the food
2011-06-29T06:06:09  <antimatroid> sure.. then?
2011-06-29T06:06:11  <aerique> antimatroid: new ant spawns, it moves north
2011-06-29T06:06:25  <aerique> antimatroid: (towards the food above it)
2011-06-29T06:06:40  <aerique> antimatroid: newly ant has spawned there already so they collide
2011-06-29T06:06:47  <aerique> antimatroid: this is all as it is supposed to
2011-06-29T06:06:51  <antimatroid> wait waht?

2011-06-29T06:06:59  <antimatroid> you move the new ant onto the food location?
2011-06-29T06:07:14  <antimatroid> either that ant will die, or it's move will be considered invalid and not processed
2011-06-29T06:07:22  <antimatroid> that's what should happen anyway
2011-06-29T06:07:33  <aerique> antimatroid: yeah, so far so good
2011-06-29T06:07:44  <antimatroid> which does it do though?
2011-06-29T06:07:50  <antimatroid> does it cancel the move or kill it?
2011-06-29T06:07:55  <aerique> antimatroid: kill
2011-06-29T06:08:03  <antimatroid> so what's the problem?
2011-06-29T06:08:21  <aerique> so the most left 'b' ant move w,w,w,n and dies colliding with the newly spawned ant
2011-06-29T06:08:38  <aerique> eh no
2011-06-29T06:08:40  <antimatroid> wait, why does it go w, w, w, n?
2011-06-29T06:08:50  <antimatroid> you go w, w, then the new ant goes north?
2011-06-29T06:08:53  <antimatroid> and new ant dies?
2011-06-29T06:08:56  <aerique> antimatroid: don't ask why, that's not the point
2011-06-29T06:09:10  <aerique> reset
2011-06-29T06:09:17  <antimatroid> let me make a slideshow...
2011-06-29T06:09:20  <aerique> the most left b ant moves w, w, w
2011-06-29T06:09:39  <aerique> or rather w, w at which point a new ant spawns
2011-06-29T06:10:04  <aerique> that new ant moves n and collides with the new ant that has spawned north of it
2011-06-29T06:10:20  <antimatroid> aerique: http://pastebin.com/72gF6g97
2011-06-29T06:10:23  <aerique> sigh.. yeah do a slide show, this sucks in words
2011-06-29T06:10:27  <antimatroid> that's what i'm getting from your explanation?
2011-06-29T06:10:59  <antimatroid> erm, does the food die when you collide with it?
2011-06-29T06:11:01  <antimatroid> or survive?
2011-06-29T06:11:03  <aerique> can i add to it?  that's not what's happening
2011-06-29T06:11:20  <antimatroid> give me something like that :P
2011-06-29T06:11:31  <aerique> yeah, moment
2011-06-29T06:13:59  <aerique> http://pastebin.com/Lwqt8Gy2
2011-06-29T06:14:21  <aerique> changed them to numbers for clarity but they all belong to the same player
2011-06-29T06:14:45  <antimatroid> it's blocking your move i suspect
2011-06-29T06:14:55  <antimatroid> like if you try to move an ant onto water, it will just ignore your move
2011-06-29T06:15:13  <antimatroid> then after it's processed the moves, your ant failed to move, so it's still adjacent to the food, so an ant spawns
2011-06-29T06:15:15  <antimatroid> does that make sense?
2011-06-29T06:15:23  <sYnfo> Yea, it depends on how you picture the death by merging I guess...
2011-06-29T06:15:31  <aerique> yeah, that's what i think is happening but should it?
2011-06-29T06:15:38  <antimatroid> imo we shouldn't block moves like that, an ant should walk onto water and die
2011-06-29T06:15:48  <antimatroid> otherwise it's hard to pick up on a bug where ants try to walk onto water
2011-06-29T06:15:57  <antimatroid> but that's what has been done, so meh :)
2011-06-29T06:16:59  <aerique> i just like the issue to be out there :)
2011-06-29T06:17:09  <aerique> but thanks for having me clarify it

2011-06-29T07:16:56  <mcstar> hi
2011-06-29T07:17:12  <mcstar> yes, you use it like this: ($ (+ $1 $2))
2011-06-29T07:17:27  <mcstar> its equivalent to (lambda ($1 $2) (+ $1 $2))
2011-06-29T07:17:39  <mcstar> and, it can be nested too
2011-06-29T07:18:44  <aerique> mcstar: i can't see me using it right away but it could be nice to have around.  i like args for self-documentation though
2011-06-29T07:19:43  <mcstar> in mathematica you can have a lambda by saying: (#1 + #2)&
2011-06-29T07:19:54  <mcstar> and im quite fond of that
2011-06-29T07:20:37  <mcstar> when you dont want to specify a full-blown lambda-list as an argument to (lambda) i guess its handy that you dont have to write the arguments explicitely
2011-06-29T07:21:06  <mcstar> but its a matter of taste i guess, what im interested in is how would you have written it?
2011-06-29T07:21:17  <aerique> mcstar: i'm not used to mathematica, but it's great to extend your Lisp like that :)
2011-06-29T07:21:42  <aerique> mcstar: i very rarely write macros, so better ask on #lisp
2011-06-29T07:21:52  <mcstar> :(

2011-06-29T07:22:06  <mcstar> i guess you dont write reader macros either?

2011-06-29T07:28:23  <mcstar> i guess in your case, since you already use globals, you could just have the value, for example turn as a special, dont you?

2011-06-29T07:30:49  <mcstar> so i use it to bind functions to symbols, so that i dont have to use funcall
2011-06-29T07:31:26  <mcstar> im wondering if setf can be extended, that when it detects a function, it behaves accordingly
2011-06-29T07:31:46  <aerique> mcstar: something like this?: https://github.com/aerique/okra/blob/master/src-common/common.lisp#L29
2011-06-29T07:32:17  <aerique> that could perhaps be turned into a defsetf
2011-06-29T07:32:42  <mcstar> like that, but my parameters are exchanged :)
2011-06-29T07:32:57  <aerique> fail ;-)
2011-06-29T07:33:43  <mcstar> why is it good to have it as a defun?
2011-06-29T07:34:06  <mcstar> i mean theres a difference regarding free variables
2011-06-29T07:34:07  <aerique> why make it more complicated than necessary?
2011-06-29T07:34:23  <mcstar> you know what i mean?
2011-06-29T07:34:39  <aerique> no :)
2011-06-29T07:35:43  <mcstar> yeah, no difference
2011-06-29T07:36:28  <mcstar> but with macros. you can eliminate the +1 function call :)
2011-06-29T07:36:41  <mcstar> lame, i know
2011-06-29T07:37:40  <aerique> i haven't got a good solution for lugging around global state though :-(
2011-06-29T07:39:05  <mcstar> you can pass certain variables as arguments all the time
2011-06-29T07:39:13  <mcstar> i pass rows, cols most of the time
2011-06-29T07:40:30  <mcstar> define-symbol-macro is good for you isnt it? makes those accesses easier
2011-06-29T07:41:00  <aerique> yup, a little less flexible than the @macro, but probably faster
2011-06-29T07:42:19  <aerique> if i don't have a global state i get some functions with a great amount of arguments, which is basically the same (and still hard to unit test) except more hidden from view
2011-06-29T07:42:48  <aerique> guess i should read some books about game programming and see how they solve it
2011-06-29T07:44:00  <mcstar> what i do in my engine, is that i store most of the game variables in a class, and the only important global variable is only that class
2011-06-29T07:44:37  <mcstar> and i initialize it, and after the start-engine returned, i.e. the game terminated for some reason i can still access anything
2011-06-29T07:45:16  <mcstar> i dont think theres a better solution, i guess they use global classess too
2011-06-29T07:45:58  <aerique> mcstar: same here with the global class
2011-06-29T07:48:27  <mcstar> most of the functions that really depend on that class, are defmethods anyway, so they dont use the global variable, they use their first argument, and other, less connected functions are given the necessary variables as arguments
2011-06-29T07:48:55  <mcstar> only while i prototype something i might use the *board* global, but soon ill modularize it(or functionalize)
2011-06-29T07:50:30  <mcstar> of course this isnt new to you, either :)
2011-06-29T07:50:40  <mcstar> i better start incorporating the new code into my bot
2011-06-29T07:52:46  <mcstar> i see, you are incorporating the utility functions from On Lisp into okra
2011-06-29T07:53:10  <aerique> yeah :)

2011-06-29T09:41:04  <stocha> j3camero: i'd like to propose 128x128 as a upper bound for maps. So people that need this upper bound can start to build their bots.
2011-06-29T09:41:27  <stocha> j3camero: i think that higher than 128x128 will get the visualizer into trouble in a lot of cases.
2011-06-29T09:42:04  <stocha> j3camero: in any way, i'd like an official upper bound for map.
2011-06-29T09:45:29  <stocha> @later tell McLeopold: hi. I think you were the one to propose 256x256 as a upper bound for maps. What about making 128x128 the official upper bound ? I don't think the visualizer will be able to handle much more in many situations.

2011-06-29T10:06:21  <mcstar> glad that i helped
2011-06-29T10:06:52  <mcstar> i finished my pathfinding
2011-06-29T10:07:02  <mcstar> i mean i finished the prototype
2011-06-29T10:07:34  <mcstar> guess what: unfortunately it involves a little-tiny-bit of bfs
2011-06-29T10:08:03  <mcstar> are you interested?
2011-06-29T10:08:55  <mcstar> yeah, i can understand, i wouldnt be either

2011-06-29T10:11:39  <antimatroid> what are you doing?
2011-06-29T10:11:48  <antimatroid> is this for collecting food? enemies? exploration?

2011-06-29T10:12:01  <mcstar> now it makes sense
2011-06-29T10:12:17  <mcstar> whatever, going from A to B
2011-06-29T10:12:34  <mcstar> so, first i compute the outline of water
2011-06-29T10:13:13  <mcstar> basically i get the 8 nbors of every water tile, add it to a set, and in the end i extract the water tiles
2011-06-29T10:14:33  *** aerique <aerique!310225@xs8.xs4all.nl> has quit IRC (Quit: ...)
2011-06-29T10:14:53  <mcstar> when theres no obstacle i use this basic alg.: compute the relative position of the target, and choose randomly from the directions that point toward the target
2011-06-29T10:16:23  <mcstar> when an ant steps into the outline of a water-block, AND the previous logic would make it step on water
2011-06-29T10:16:35  <mcstar> it changes behavior
2011-06-29T10:16:54  <mcstar> it generates a path in the outline, which brings it closer to the target
2011-06-29T10:17:21  <mcstar> and when i generate the possible paths in the outline i use a bit of bfs
2011-06-29T10:17:57  <mcstar> the ant is on a tile next to water, and the bfs computes the tiles in the outline seccesively away from it
2011-06-29T10:18:02  <mcstar> 1,2,3,4...
2011-06-29T10:18:26  <mcstar> until no tile left untouched in the outline ,or similary the paths merge
2011-06-29T10:18:46  <mcstar> basically thats it
2011-06-29T10:18:53  <antimatroid> (reddit distracts me :P, reading now..)
2011-06-29T10:19:45  <antimatroid> why don't you just use a* already? :p
2011-06-29T10:19:50  <mcstar> naw
2011-06-29T10:20:34  <mcstar> this way im deling with a minimum number of squares
2011-06-29T10:20:37  <mcstar> dealing
2011-06-29T10:20:51  <antimatroid> i don't know about that
2011-06-29T10:21:35  <mcstar> and the bfs isnt really a full-blown bfs, i exit immediately when i find the one tile i was looking for in the outline, the one closest to the target
2011-06-29T10:21:53  <mcstar> oh, and of course the water-blocks are separated
2011-06-29T10:22:21  <mcstar> so im only dealing with an outline which is the outline of a single connected pond, the one the ant tried to walk on
2011-06-29T10:23:12  <antimatroid> that sounds both more complicated than a* and worse :P
2011-06-29T10:23:14  <mcstar> and when the ant is not on one of them, theres no searching at all
2011-06-29T10:23:34  <mcstar> i dont think its much worse
2011-06-29T10:24:02  <mcstar> i agree that this isnt as robust as a standard graph searching alg.
2011-06-29T10:24:33  <antimatroid> i have converted to being a really big fan of a* now that i understand it
2011-06-29T10:24:52  <mcstar> hey, i told it before, i like it too, its nice
2011-06-29T10:25:02  <mcstar> but i didnt invent it, so ...

2011-06-29T10:26:29  <mcstar> and it wasnt you
2011-06-29T10:32:26  <mcstar> antimatroid: what do you mean exactly by multiple target A*?
2011-06-29T10:33:16  <antimatroid> mcstar: say you take an ant as a source and the set of food locations as your targets and you want to find a minimum lengthed path to a food square
2011-06-29T10:33:21  <antimatroid> then you have multiple targets
2011-06-29T10:33:57  <mcstar> yes, but does the algorithm guarantees that no two ants try to step on the same tile at the same time?
2011-06-29T10:34:23  <mcstar> ah, sorry
2011-06-29T10:34:30  <mcstar> 1 ant multiple food ok
2011-06-29T10:34:38  <antimatroid> i do use multiple sources too
2011-06-29T10:34:43  <antimatroid> but i move 1 ant per search
2011-06-29T10:34:47  <mcstar> im more interested in that
2011-06-29T10:34:57  <antimatroid> multiple sources is really easy
2011-06-29T10:35:05  <mcstar> how do you make sure of the above?
2011-06-29T10:35:08  <antimatroid> just add all ants locations to your queue when you start searching

2011-06-29T10:35:36  <antimatroid> then when you find a shortest path to food, move the ant and start searching again

2011-06-29T10:35:50  <stocha> everyone same distance to food ? so the one with an opponent that don't want to suicide wins ?
2011-06-29T10:36:08  <stocha> antimatroid: it has the interesting property of how much a map can affect bot strength
2011-06-29T10:36:31  <stocha> here the suicidal bots have an advantage.
2011-06-29T10:36:39  <stocha> but if there all are, the game result in a draw.

2011-06-29T10:37:45  <antimatroid> mcstar: I think it's quicker to use multiple sources than not to
2011-06-29T10:37:49  <stocha> still a very interesting case of a map breaking most good features in bots.
2011-06-29T10:37:52  <smiley1983> I like the new symmetric maps
2011-06-29T10:37:55  <antimatroid> because you will find the shortest path with the one search

2011-06-29T10:38:30  <antimatroid> i'm with _flag, they're too "closed off"
2011-06-29T10:38:32  <smiley1983> is there a reason they're all keeping the four walls around the edge, though? I think it would be better if there were some breaks
2011-06-29T10:38:40  <antimatroid> needs wider corridors and i like toroidalness
2011-06-29T10:38:48  <mcstar> antimatroid: so you add the new locations of previous ants' to a ban-list?
2011-06-29T10:38:48  <stocha> i don't know about the rest. But the half distance to bot starting food is nasty :p
2011-06-29T10:38:49  <antimatroid> ask mcleopold

2011-06-29T10:39:08  <smiley1983> oh yes, they need some work on the actual generator to make them playable
2011-06-29T10:39:10  <mcstar> yeah, but thats not enough
2011-06-29T10:39:11  <stocha> the nash equlibra seems to go straight at the food, and commit suicide in most cases.
2011-06-29T10:39:29  <antimatroid> mcstar: i was thinking yesterday... you could hash information about paths for ants to food they are collecting
2011-06-29T10:39:29  <mcstar> you must tell the alg. that it must exclude those tiles where you already sent an ant
2011-06-29T10:40:10  <stocha> will the beta use random maps soon ? (rather than a fixed set of generated one)
2011-06-29T10:40:25  <antimatroid> then at the start of each turn, collected food that isn't expecting to be collected including your ants you're expecting to move, then after that collect ants with previous paths if a new one hasn't been found, then recollect food for what you expected to have collected but a new path was found..
2011-06-29T10:40:31  <mcstar> antimatroid: there are a gigantic number of paths..
2011-06-29T10:40:57  <mcstar> lol, let me read that again
2011-06-29T10:41:01  <antimatroid> i don't mean paths between locations, i mean once you collect food, store that path
2011-06-29T10:41:18  <stocha> antimatroid: what about pushing 128x128 maps as upper bound for map size ?
2011-06-29T10:41:19  <antimatroid> and unless you find a closer food square in the time it takes to get there, keep using that path
2011-06-29T10:41:22  <antimatroid> and don't recollect that food item
2011-06-29T10:41:40  <mcstar> ah

2011-06-29T10:42:10  <mcstar> bye stocha
2011-06-29T10:43:04  <antimatroid> another problem i've been thinking about is hunting down enemy ants at the end of a game for a kill
2011-06-29T10:43:24  <antimatroid> better bots are going to try and avoid you and if the maps have long paths, they might be able to evade your vision with mazey maps
2011-06-29T10:43:39  <antimatroid> so you really need to track information about where enemy ants out of vision might be
2011-06-29T10:43:51  <antimatroid> i already track such information for food, that's easy
2011-06-29T10:44:34  <antimatroid> doing it for enemies is slightly more complicated, you want to try and match up ants that you see die so you don't carry that information then flood the map slowly from the square to not-visible squares
2011-06-29T10:45:13  <antimatroid> it will be cool to watch the chaser/evader tactics of bots here
2011-06-29T10:45:17  <antimatroid> particularly the better bots
2011-06-29T10:45:40  <antimatroid> this game is really awesome for ai
2011-06-29T10:45:49  <mcstar> its like in the beginning, searching for food, in the end you search for hiding enemies
2011-06-29T10:46:13  <antimatroid> yeah, but you can use information
2011-06-29T10:46:21  <antimatroid> like if you see them running down a corridor across water
2011-06-29T10:46:29  <antimatroid> you can use that information to hunt them down
2011-06-29T10:46:34  <mcstar> so you want to estimate the remaining number of enemy ants?
2011-06-29T10:46:45  <antimatroid> no, i want to estimate where ants will be
2011-06-29T10:46:51  <carlop> antimatroid: i think one should store a bool[r][c] that say if an enemy can be there, and at every turn make possible_enemy[r][c] = (is visible AND an enemy is there ) OR (is not visible AND near to a cell such that possible_enemy was true the turn before)
2011-06-29T10:47:22  <antimatroid> carlop: i will have something saying the last turn an enemy ant seen could have reached a square
2011-06-29T10:47:27  <mcstar> but i think this logic must be activated factoring in the number of enemies, number of own ants, and remaining turn and controlled territory
2011-06-29T10:47:59  <antimatroid> like if an enemy ant information is outside of view, that information will be made the current turn
2011-06-29T10:48:08  <antimatroid> and that information will "propagate" outwards every turn
2011-06-29T10:48:15  <antimatroid> to non-visible squares
2011-06-29T10:48:18  <mcstar> you can associate a number whith every such turn and decrease it as the time you visited it goes by
2011-06-29T10:48:28  <mcstar> such turn- >such tile
2011-06-29T10:48:48  <antimatroid> then you can do a search based off this information
2011-06-29T10:49:10  <mcstar> yeah, you weight the edges by this number
2011-06-29T10:49:13  <carlop> basically i'm doing the same thing of you, assuming that at the beginning each un-seen cell can be an enemy
2011-06-29T10:49:13  <antimatroid> also, if you want to avoid enemies because you have a small army, you can use information about where enemy ants are to avoid them in your searches
2011-06-29T10:49:37  <mcstar> of course this info can be TOTALLY wrong
2011-06-29T10:49:52  <antimatroid> well, more importantly make information about how the minimum turns it would take an enemy ant to get to each location, which you can do with a single pass of the map
2011-06-29T10:50:18  <mcstar> more so if the enemy likes to coagulate
2011-06-29T10:50:30  <mcstar> (that sounds weird)
2011-06-29T10:52:12  <mcstar> does anyone except stocha have a snake bot?
2011-06-29T10:52:32  <mcstar> except->besides
2011-06-29T10:52:39  <antimatroid> no, but i was thinking of how easy it would be to do success patterns
2011-06-29T10:52:50  <mcstar> i want a snake with attack-heads
2011-06-29T10:53:12  <antimatroid> make a list of target squares that is your success pattern, fill those targets with ants first, then attack enemies with the rest of your ants
2011-06-29T10:53:12  <mcstar> and its body could swipe to collect food
2011-06-29T10:53:19  <antimatroid> success pattern done
2011-06-29T10:53:37  <antimatroid> so something like "come at me bro"
2011-06-29T10:53:40  <antimatroid> written on the map
2011-06-29T10:53:55  <mcstar> thats a lot of ants
2011-06-29T10:53:59  <antimatroid> or a star
2011-06-29T10:54:04  <antimatroid> but come at me bro would be cooler :P
2011-06-29T10:54:10  <mcstar> ive seen a map with penises
2011-06-29T10:54:16  <mcstar> it was gross
2011-06-29T10:54:26  <mcstar> one of these new symmetric ones
2011-06-29T10:54:35  <antimatroid> i will never get sick of poorly drawn penises
2011-06-29T10:54:39  <antimatroid> whether intentional or not
2011-06-29T10:55:01  <mcstar> yeah, i wonder if the ants get distracted
2011-06-29T10:55:17  <antimatroid> one type of four player symmetry seems to be a communist
2011-06-29T10:55:42  <mcstar> really? hammer and sickle-something?
2011-06-29T10:55:53  <mcstar> whats that called?
2011-06-29T10:55:58  <antimatroid> by communist i mean nazi :P
2011-06-29T10:56:02  <antimatroid> don't ask me how i got that :P
2011-06-29T10:56:07  <mcstar> ah, ok ive seen that
2011-06-29T10:56:19  <mcstar> that barbeque is pretty awesome

2011-06-29T12:46:00  <McLeopold1> The skill levels really dropped
2011-06-29T12:46:14  <antimatroid> my bot rose in rankings
2011-06-29T12:46:14  <antimatroid> a lot
2011-06-29T12:46:26  <antimatroid> i swear it was back past like 10th
2011-06-29T12:46:51  <McLeopold1> antimatroid I'm thinking an official minimum like we did for pw
2011-06-29T12:47:12  <antimatroid> yeah sure
2011-06-29T12:47:14  <antimatroid> any idea what?
2011-06-29T12:47:19  <antimatroid> i try to make it as large as i can
2011-06-29T12:47:44  <antimatroid> but then again, a good bot should know not to just die immediately
2011-06-29T12:47:49  <McLeopold1> 2 * viewradius
2011-06-29T12:48:01  <antimatroid> my bot wont chase enemies unless it thinks it has a clear majority, but it doesn't necessarily avoid at this point
2011-06-29T12:48:04  <McLeopold1> so, 14 right now
2011-06-29T12:48:19  <antimatroid> you could get away with more i think
2011-06-29T12:48:27  <antimatroid> 3*view you could probably get away with
2011-06-29T12:48:31  <antimatroid> i'm thinking max players 8?
2011-06-29T12:48:37  <McLeopold1> min, not max
2011-06-29T12:48:49  <antimatroid> including tile maps
2011-06-29T12:49:12  <McLeopold1> tile maps don't really need a min
2011-06-29T12:49:19  <antimatroid> min what?
2011-06-29T12:49:35  <McLeopold1> or, the min is also the min map dimensions
2011-06-29T12:49:43  <McLeopold1> min distance between starting ants
2011-06-29T12:49:50  <antimatroid> i think it's needed anyway
2011-06-29T12:49:57  <antimatroid> it might not be with the conditions i put on it
2011-06-29T12:50:09  <antimatroid> but otherwise one of the enemy ants might end up close
2011-06-29T12:53:05  <antimatroid> um, go with 2*vision for the moment
2011-06-29T12:55:08  <McLeopold1> y
2011-06-29T12:55:40  <McLeopold1> that way you have some food you can always get to first
2011-06-29T12:55:56  <McLeopold1> because we spawn 2 to 4 food in the starting vision radius

2011-06-29T13:54:53  <carlop> McLeopold1: i prefer that min_distance is greater than 14, cause small min_distance can cause that 2 team should fight for the same area, and the result are influenced by the starting position (who is the bot near to you..).

2011-06-29T13:55:17  <mcstar> my linux just froze
2011-06-29T13:55:32  <mcstar> i havent had this for years
2011-06-29T13:56:27  <mcstar> maybe its time to switch...
2011-06-29T13:56:42  <mcstar> ... to freebsd
2011-06-29T13:57:44  <carlop> with bigger min_distance the nearest enemy and second nearest enemy (and maybe 3rd nearest) are at the same distance, so it's easier to have a balanced start position for every team (eg. have 1 strong and 1 basic bot, instead of drawing on who have a good aggressive bot near to him)
2011-06-29T13:57:54  <McLeopold1> olexs: as long as the command "javac MyBot.java" works, then you are good
2011-06-29T13:58:13  <McLeopold1> carlop: I'm not opposed to close starting positions
2011-06-29T13:59:01  <McLeopold1> I think it is a reasonable game where 2 bots are forced to fight first, then the winner take on the winner of the fight at the other side of the map
2011-06-29T13:59:09  <carlop> but who have a bot that timeout near to him have a big boost
2011-06-29T13:59:29  <carlop> so there is more chance involved
2011-06-29T13:59:32  <McLeopold1> you could make that argument for any map
2011-06-29T13:59:58  <carlop> no, if you have 3 enemy at almost the same distance
2011-06-29T14:00:32  <McLeopold1> okay, almost any map, but not 3 player equidistant
2011-06-29T14:00:50  <carlop> if a bot timeout, his 3 neighbour eat his territory, but have only 1/3 advantage over (1v1) v (1v1)
2011-06-29T14:02:06  <McLeopold1> what if all bots start close together at the center of an open map
2011-06-29T14:02:13  <antimatroid> what about the rankings if you do "multiples games on one"
2011-06-29T14:02:58  <antimatroid> we rank bots based on their relative ranking in the game, if the two strongest bots play off right at the start, one might get knocked out right before crapper bots have time to increase their score
2011-06-29T14:03:01  <McLeopold1> maybe the metric should be average starting distance to each other ant must be within a reasonable range
2011-06-29T14:03:15  <antimatroid> i think overall it should even out, but personally i'm in preference of starting them further away
2011-06-29T14:04:00  <antimatroid> like, i have tried to design my maze maps so that enemies only path doesn't lead directly to a symmetric junction for an opponent
2011-06-29T14:04:07  <McLeopold1> so the closest ant shouldn't be less the half the distance to the furthest ant
2011-06-29T14:04:18  <antimatroid> i imagine it'd be a lot like some pw maps, where only a few planets ended up being relevant to the game
2011-06-29T14:04:41  <antimatroid> bots* only path
2011-06-29T14:04:47  <McLeopold1> distance as the crow flies
2011-06-29T14:05:02  <McLeopold1> path distance would be tougher to enforce
2011-06-29T14:05:09  <antimatroid> perhaps a better idea is to maximise the starting distance locations if we can?
2011-06-29T14:05:09  <carlop> for the same reasoning I think is better a map like this: http://ants.zeroviz.us/cTf4T/ (the pattern suck, just look at the distance between team) so many enemy are almost in the same range, and if a bot timeout (or do stupid things) don't favor a singe team
2011-06-29T14:05:24  <antimatroid> carlop: not sure how hard it would be to find those locations?
2011-06-29T14:05:35  <antimatroid> a translation of the maps will make finding symmetry harder and should hide that
2011-06-29T14:06:38  <carlop> maximize starting distance can be a good thing, that basically impose that 1st distance and 2nd distance are similar
2011-06-29T14:07:11  <carlop> maybe just look at 10 random starting position, and choose the one that have min_distance maximized
2011-06-29T14:08:05  <carlop> so we have map where there are nearby enemy, but most of time map are balanced
2011-06-29T14:09:10  <McLeopold1> http://ants.zeroviz.us/OOAku/
2011-06-29T14:12:23  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: did you ever get the map stats thing going?  can we get a distance table from a  map?
2011-06-29T14:13:35  <antimatroid> map stats, like for asymmetric maps?
2011-06-29T14:13:36  <antimatroid> no
2011-06-29T14:13:43  <antimatroid> what do you mean by distance table?
2011-06-29T14:16:48  <carlop> McLeopold1: a problem with this game is that map is symmetric but food generation is not....
2011-06-29T14:17:08  <carlop> now i have to go, I'm back later for other map generation/strategy discussion
2011-06-29T14:18:05  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: I mean a matrix of players with starting distances between them, for straight and path finding

2011-06-29T14:19:06  <McLeopold1> if a map is symmetric, then each ant should have an equal space they can reach first
2011-06-29T14:19:30  <McLeopold1> so, maybe we should remove 1 ant and check the starting space

2011-06-29T14:21:32  <antimatroid> and if that's too small compared to land/no_players, reject map?

2011-06-29T14:37:21  <antimatroid> McLeopold: a different idea..
2011-06-29T14:37:40  <antimatroid> find the squares that a player can reach in less moves than the closest square at equal access to an enemy
2011-06-29T14:37:54  <antimatroid> no, that's silly
2011-06-29T14:38:17  <antimatroid> i'm thinking of a case of block mazes with the one path to each other, but more generally that is ridiculous
2011-06-29T14:38:37  <McLeopold1> so, that 8 player map can't be right?
2011-06-29T14:39:56  <antimatroid> what why?

2011-06-29T16:13:05  <mcstar> do you keep ants in between turns?
2011-06-29T16:13:19  <crashing> that -e -E was all i needed
2011-06-29T16:13:24  <UncleVasya> mcstar: what did you asked me about?
2011-06-29T16:13:27  <UncleVasya> ah, ok
2011-06-29T16:13:33  <UncleVasya> no, I don't.
2011-06-29T16:13:39  <mcstar> thx :)
2011-06-29T16:13:58  <crashing> play_one_game.sh has dist/sample, but there is no dist.  should just be sample_bots/python/...
2011-06-29T16:14:06  <crashing> rather than dist/sample_bots/...
2011-06-29T16:14:16  <UncleVasya> But I was thinking about it.
2011-06-29T16:14:16  <crashing> error was bot not found
2011-06-29T16:14:36  <UncleVasya> I want to keep ants directions between turns.
2011-06-29T16:14:44  <McLeopold1> yeah, the dist directory fix is on the todo list
2011-06-29T16:15:00  <mcstar> McLeopold1: dont you want to add -e by default to playgame.py in play_one_game?
2011-06-29T16:15:04  <crashing> is it on github?  i can chekc it in :)

2011-06-29T16:20:03  <UncleVasya> mcstar: For now my bot is pretty basic and I'm not going to implement some advanced staff because I have no time :( July 6 is my deadline.
2011-06-29T16:20:44  <mcstar> you mean you dont have time for it until july 6?
2011-06-29T16:20:50  <UncleVasya> I think a very basic battle mechanism is the last thing I will do for ants.
2011-06-29T16:21:08  <mcstar> ah, ok, sorry to hear that
2011-06-29T16:21:20  <UncleVasya> no, I mean I will not have a computer from July 6 to end of the august.
2011-06-29T16:21:39  <mcstar> may i ask why?
2011-06-29T16:22:11  <UncleVasya> And also better food gathering and spreading I  hope to make.
2011-06-29T16:23:36  <UncleVasya> mcstar:  My real home and my place for studying are the very different towns. I have computer only in my studying place.

2011-06-29T16:26:44  <mcstar> is the computer the problem or internet access?
2011-06-29T16:27:06  <mcstar> sorry that i ask soo many questions, feel free to not answer them :)
2011-06-29T16:29:33  <UncleVasya> I had a computer there but when grandmother (I have no parents and live with her from 11 (now I'm 20)). bought a computer for studying here she said that 2 computers are to much for one person and my old one went to my uncle.
2011-06-29T16:30:11  <UncleVasya> But I will have an internet connection.

2011-06-29T16:36:02  <mcstar> i can understand then
2011-06-29T16:36:55  <mcstar> try buying a laptop, i loved mine very much
2011-06-29T16:37:08  <mcstar> i had an old powerbook g4 from work
2011-06-29T16:37:17  <sYnfo> Russia's big. Where you study if I may ask?
2011-06-29T16:37:20  <mcstar> but it died, i miss it very much

2011-06-29T16:38:36  <sYnfo> No. :) Czech Rep. but, eh... We had our share of Russian in the past. :)
2011-06-29T16:38:47  <mcstar> say no more :D
2011-06-29T16:39:06  <mcstar> we need to put that behind..
2011-06-29T16:39:26  <sYnfo> Mos def, I'm already behind that honestly, it didn't hit my generation at all.
2011-06-29T16:39:52  <sYnfo> Same with german, really.
2011-06-29T16:39:58  <mcstar> well, we had to attend the '56 ceremonies in school
2011-06-29T16:39:59  <sYnfo> I mean even more so.
2011-06-29T16:40:07  <sYnfo> Really? How old are you?
2011-06-29T16:40:13  <mcstar> 25
2011-06-29T16:40:31  <mcstar> thats not the point, we celebrate those things
2011-06-29T16:40:36  <sYnfo> Oh, 20 here, I guess our 25s had to do the same.
2011-06-29T16:40:39  <sYnfo> I see
2011-06-29T16:40:42  <mcstar> failed revolutions and such...
2011-06-29T16:40:42  <UncleVasya> mcstar: The problem with laptop is that I want a expensive one. An I decided to accumulate money for few years and buy Lenovo ThinkPad T5xx  (I love the name - ThinkPad :D)
2011-06-29T16:41:21  <sYnfo> UncleVaysa: That's the way to go pal. I'm gettin my own TP soon, I my summer job works out. :)
2011-06-29T16:41:24  <mcstar> UncleVasya: im the exact opssite: i think theres no point in buying an expensive latop, only if you have a big vallet
2011-06-29T16:41:45  <sYnfo> We're not so rich as to buy cheap things :P
2011-06-29T16:41:55  <mcstar> wtf :)

2011-06-29T16:43:36  <mcstar> they say that turists will go there instead of Budapest
2011-06-29T16:43:36  <sYnfo> I going to study there next year. :)
2011-06-29T16:44:02  <sYnfo> Could be, honestly I've never *really* been to Prague
2011-06-29T16:45:24  <UncleVasya> I'm considering a laptom as a alternative for PC.Not as an additional thing. For me, I mean.
2011-06-29T16:46:06  <sYnfo> But won't your granny say the same thing? I mean from her point of view it's gonna be just another PC right.
2011-06-29T16:46:21  <sYnfo> I see
2011-06-29T16:46:23  <sYnfo> Oh
2011-06-29T16:48:20  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you study computer science right? i think you need more than one computer
2011-06-29T16:48:27  <mcstar> your granny will understand
2011-06-29T16:49:41  <amstan> ugh.. someone remind me to never delete a git copy of the kernel
2011-06-29T16:49:50  <amstan> it might be useful later on

2011-06-29T16:50:52  <amstan> i can, but it's a 800mb download
2011-06-29T16:51:02  <amstan> i'm to 102MB and it's only at 12%
2011-06-29T16:51:39  <mcstar> i have downloaded kernels before but i remember they were around a 100 Mbs
2011-06-29T16:51:53  <amstan> git clones are bigger, they contain the whole history
2011-06-29T16:52:06  <amstan> they're much easier to update later on though
2011-06-29T16:52:07  <mcstar> and you need it i take it, but why?
2011-06-29T16:52:27  <mcstar> why are you compiling kernels?
2011-06-29T16:52:29  <amstan> you can just git pull and it'll only get the differences
2011-06-29T16:52:37  <amstan> i need it to make a distro for my arm board

2011-06-29T17:31:44  <mcstar> its my opinion after watching movies
2011-06-29T17:31:59  <sYnfo> Sure, just saying :)
2011-06-29T17:32:22  <mcstar> for example i just watched Undisputed III
2011-06-29T17:32:39  <hacklash> all the ghetto soviet excercise equipment in the apartment building courtyards was cool
2011-06-29T17:32:41  <sYnfo> hacklash: No doubt, I was just wondering where you stand on that "american" ban of public drinking
2011-06-29T17:32:48  <mcstar> the story takes place in east-european prisons
2011-06-29T17:34:29  <mcstar> i dont know about you guys, do you have much garbage where you live?
2011-06-29T17:34:34  <hacklash> sYnfo: I think it comes from prohibition and speak easy's, while communism didn't encourage the building of bars, so people drink at home or on park benches
2011-06-29T17:35:00  <hacklash> i think the rules work pretty well for the places they were designed
2011-06-29T17:35:09  <mcstar> when i was crossing the border to romania, in my childhood, i was always surprised by the amount of garbage they had near the rails
2011-06-29T17:35:25  <mcstar> and now you can see similar things coming from Budapest
2011-06-29T17:35:25  <sYnfo> hacklash: So you mean that public drinking never really was a problem around here, so no-one had to ban it? Could be I guess.
2011-06-29T17:35:28  <hacklash> oh also nobody cared about littering which was weird to me
2011-06-29T17:36:03  <hacklash> i saw somebody litter literally 5 feet from a trash can
2011-06-29T17:36:17  <sYnfo> heh
2011-06-29T17:36:23  <mcstar> and those homeless guys
2011-06-29T17:36:34  <hacklash> oh, sorry 2 meters
2011-06-29T17:36:38  <mcstar> they spread in the city, and they mess up the rails
2011-06-29T17:36:50  <mcstar> almost the same
2011-06-29T17:37:15  <mcstar> (of course not, when youre talking about peoples height :))
2011-06-29T17:37:42  <hacklash> i forgot that some people don't use feet very often
2011-06-29T17:38:05  <mcstar> im kind of accustomed to it, cause i read celebheights.com
2011-06-29T17:38:08  <mcstar> :D

2011-06-29T17:39:54  <hacklash> my guess for heart of Europe would have been germany, but hen i looked at the map
2011-06-29T17:40:17  <sYnfo> heh
2011-06-29T17:41:01  <mcstar> well, im in central europe i know that for sure

2011-06-29T17:41:39  <hacklash> that depends on how much of russia you count, right?
2011-06-29T17:41:41  <mcstar> russia is not europe

2011-06-29T17:42:54  <mcstar> yes, whats happening to greece?
2011-06-29T17:43:23  <sYnfo> I should correct myself. It may not be a good thing to be in EU
2011-06-29T17:44:25  <hacklash> are you talking a bout a possible cave in of the the euro  in order to support the greek debts?
2011-06-29T17:44:28  <mcstar> the big brass here tries to pay off the national debt too

2011-06-29T17:45:18  <mcstar> what does that mean cave in here?
2011-06-29T17:45:32  <mcstar> i mean financially
2011-06-29T17:45:50  <hacklash> i wanted to use collapse, but that seems to be too strong
2011-06-29T17:45:51  <mcstar> does greece have euro?
2011-06-29T17:46:21  <sYnfo> Greece is a part of EU, that's the point
2011-06-29T17:46:24  <mcstar> i guess they do, so it means they switch back? or what?
2011-06-29T17:48:02  <sYnfo> Well, if Euro fails, EU won't be there for too long, and frankly, as I see it, we need EU just to have a say in what's happening in the world

2011-06-29T17:51:13  <sYnfo> Well, I'm not exactly an economist
2011-06-29T17:51:14  <sYnfo> But
2011-06-29T17:51:43  <sYnfo> When a nation has it's own currency and gets in a deep debt, what does it do?
2011-06-29T17:52:58  <sYnfo> Hell, yeah, I sure am not an economist, I'm not sure I can explain that :D
2011-06-29T17:53:19  <sYnfo> Thing is, if greece goes down, everyone who uses Euro has to go too
2011-06-29T17:53:26  <sYnfo> In a way
2011-06-29T17:53:45  <sYnfo> That's how I understand it anyway :)
2011-06-29T17:53:55  <mcstar> first of all i dont really understand the credit-dept network
2011-06-29T17:54:07  <mcstar> i mean who exactly own who
2011-06-29T17:54:09  <mcstar> and such
2011-06-29T17:54:40  <mcstar> but i guess when a coutry reaches colapse it asks for money from the IMF
2011-06-29T17:55:22  <mcstar> f, im kind of tired to write this in english now
2011-06-29T17:55:34  <sYnfo> I feel your pain buddy
2011-06-29T17:56:24  <sYnfo> I should be doing things for my college anyway, just can't get myself to do it.
2011-06-29T17:57:29  <mcstar> so i guess, it really depends on the footnotes of the treaty that we all signed when we joined to the eu
2011-06-29T17:57:42  <mcstar> i guess those circumstances are dealt with properly
2011-06-29T17:58:27  <mcstar> so im not sure how far will the eu go to save a country, but i dont think it will collapse, just because 1 country sits in shat
2011-06-29T17:59:40  <mcstar> i probably should look it up, but i think that for example a big part of out national dept is from times close to ww2
2011-06-29T17:59:49  <mcstar> out->our
2011-06-29T18:00:15  <mcstar> its kind of ridiculous that we still pay for those times
2011-06-29T18:00:16  <sYnfo> Well, if CZ were to collapse, I don't think anyone would mind, really. The difference here is, that Greece uses Euro. Now what you do when you have a debt you can't pay back is you devaluate your currency, basically you print the money you need right, but Greece cannot really do that.
2011-06-29T18:00:21  <sYnfo> Heh, yeah

2011-06-29T18:01:27  <mcstar> yes, you introduce huge inflation, and give out money without backing it up
2011-06-29T18:01:32  <sYnfo> Yea
2011-06-29T18:01:33  <mcstar> but thats not really a solution
2011-06-29T18:01:50  <sYnfo> Well, depend on how you look at things
2011-06-29T18:01:54  <sYnfo> It is for the country
2011-06-29T18:01:59  <mcstar> as far as i know russia was considered to be COLLAPSED
2011-06-29T18:02:03  <mcstar> economically
2011-06-29T18:03:02  <sYnfo> Could be, I don't really now much about the 98

2011-06-29T18:04:19  <sYnfo> Look at USA
2011-06-29T18:04:24  <mcstar> they have a bad attitude towards these things
2011-06-29T18:04:54  <sYnfo> To some extend, yes, but they certainly don't expect their government to take care of them

2011-06-29T18:39:52  <mcstar> the poor kid cant do anything else except being racist too
2011-06-29T18:40:14  <mcstar> it takes education and communication to break those preconceptions
2011-06-29T18:41:19  <sYnfo> Sure, but I'm not saying it was necessarily stupid from their point of view, but from our, arguably more developed one, it is.

2011-06-29T18:41:33  <mcstar> of course there will be groups of people who hate other groups of people simple because they do something different than the others

2011-06-29T18:43:24  <mcstar> lol, as if ppl from the us cant be ateists
2011-06-29T18:43:43  <sYnfo> I'm not saying they can't, just asking :)
2011-06-29T18:44:09  <mcstar> whatever their answer is, its not gonna be representative

2011-06-29T18:44:29  <McLeopold1> religion is way older than the US
2011-06-29T18:44:53  <mcstar> thats true
2011-06-29T18:44:54  <McLeopold1> and everywhere
2011-06-29T18:44:57  <sYnfo> Then any other country I'd dare to say
2011-06-29T18:45:15  <sYnfo> But you personally?
2011-06-29T18:45:17  <mcstar> do you consider pagans religious?
2011-06-29T18:45:42  <McLeopold1> I think by a dictionary definition of peganism, they are.
2011-06-29T18:45:44  <sYnfo> Sure
2011-06-29T18:45:58  <mcstar> in that case it predates countries
2011-06-29T18:46:20  <mcstar> but organized religion is linked with the founding of countries
2011-06-29T18:47:37  <mcstar> but educated and not blind people know that religion is a snake biting its own tail
2011-06-29T18:47:43  <McLeopold1> Both religion and governments are concerned with establishing a set of morals and values for its members.  They go well together.
2011-06-29T18:48:16  <mcstar> religion was the motivation, to make people behave
2011-06-29T18:48:46  <mcstar> young countries cant afford a "police"
2011-06-29T18:49:18  <mcstar> they relied on religion to make people abide the law
2011-06-29T18:49:33  <mcstar> but
2011-06-29T18:49:37  <mcstar> my main point
2011-06-29T18:50:00  <sYnfo> McLeopold1: I'm not sure goverment is really concerned with morality to be honest. Legality, sure, but that is hardly the same thing.
2011-06-29T18:50:10  <mcstar> is that religion teaches you about a force, god, that you cant have a sensory verification of its existance
2011-06-29T18:50:30  <mcstar> a->e
2011-06-29T18:51:11  <mcstar> and why would you even consider something you cant be sure of?
2011-06-29T18:51:26  <mcstar> just because they made up "afterlife"?
2011-06-29T18:51:29  <mcstar> and hell?
2011-06-29T18:51:53  <mcstar> i think today those things have lost their power
2011-06-29T18:52:27  <mcstar> so today, religion is more like phylosophy
2011-06-29T18:52:49  <mcstar> but for one, im sure im not interested in qestions that by definition cannot be answered
2011-06-29T18:53:10  <mcstar> (not totally true, im sort of interested in godel's work)
2011-06-29T18:54:55  <mcstar> sYnfo: another thing i think future generations will consider stupid is using computers
2011-06-29T18:55:17  <mcstar> imagine how many hours you sit in front of your machine staring a scree?
2011-06-29T18:55:19  <mcstar> n
2011-06-29T18:55:29  <mcstar> typing??? on a keyboard?
2011-06-29T18:55:42  <mcstar> i already laugh at myself
2011-06-29T18:55:58  <mcstar> neural interfaces will change all of this
2011-06-29T18:56:21  <mcstar> imagine writing a program in your head, while youre running on the beach
2011-06-29T18:56:21  <sYnfo> mcstar: yea, no doubt
2011-06-29T18:56:50  <mcstar> i think some kind of brain multi-tasking will happen not too far
2011-06-29T18:57:29  <mcstar> at some point they will laugh at us, how badly did we recycle garbage, poisonos materials
2011-06-29T18:57:42  <mcstar> how badly did we pollute our biosphere
2011-06-29T18:57:58  <mcstar> oh, and hunger
2011-06-29T18:58:12  <mcstar> they wont understand why didnt we solve that one before
2011-06-29T18:58:29  <mcstar> in the future it will be seen as trivial
2011-06-29T18:59:06  <sYnfo> Could be, provided civilization survives that long
2011-06-29T18:59:14  <mcstar> from a pure scientific point of view, i dont think that they will see anything as stupid, or laughable
2011-06-29T18:59:45  <mcstar> science doesnt make previous resuls incorrect, it generalizes things
2011-06-29T19:00:30  <mcstar> the only way they would think of previous results as trivial if they had just like i said before, neural implants
2011-06-29T19:00:41  <mcstar> which helps of abstract thinking
2011-06-29T19:01:01  <mcstar> making those results more easily comprehensible, even for the uninitiated
2011-06-29T19:01:43  <mcstar> or some kind of collective knowledge, which empower you with many other person's memories/feelings/understandings at once
2011-06-29T19:02:23  <mcstar> oh, and lets not forget diseases
2011-06-29T19:02:49  <mcstar> future me will scratch his head why the f didnt they cure aids a long time ago?
2011-06-29T19:03:04  <mcstar> its soo simple now, they teach it in primary school
2011-06-29T19:03:06  <mcstar> :D
2011-06-29T19:04:17  <sYnfo> Good point I guess. But I'm off to bed now, gn .)
