2011-07-29T14:17:37  <agweber> There's not a way to get rid of past submissions is there? My failed to compile ones make my recent submissions list stretch out horizontally and otherwise makes my page look bad
2011-07-29T14:19:56  <amstan> agweber: if you know html, you could fix this
2011-07-29T14:20:31  <agweber> Yeah, how would I go about that

2011-07-29T14:28:26  <agweber> I do believe you'd have to have access to the database to change data for an individual user since profile.php pulls from one.
2011-07-29T14:29:13  <agweber> I could look into changing the profile to allow users to remove submissions, but that's more than I want to commit for such a petty thing, but it may be something someone else may want to do
2011-07-29T14:33:19  <amstan> agweber: it's not about removing the submission
2011-07-29T14:33:28  <amstan> the problem is the html breaking when there's too many
2011-07-29T14:33:36  <amstan> they shouldn't have to remove submissions
2011-07-29T14:34:02  <agweber> Ah, it's a width thing I'm concerned about.. I'll look at fixing that later, gotta go to work now
