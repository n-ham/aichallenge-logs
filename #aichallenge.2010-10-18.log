2010-10-18T00:20:59  <antimatroid> rebelxt_: it's hard to get the tree to make good choices
2010-10-18T00:21:28  <antimatroid> atm it's sort of randomly picking expansionary and offensive moves while filling in the rest each turn
2010-10-18T00:23:13  *** Olathe <Olathe!~Olathe@unaffiliated/olathe> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2010-10-18T00:23:36  <rebelxt_> 250 ELO for a first revision of tree search bot is a great start. i assume you are mixing in some heuristics from your official bot
2010-10-18T00:24:22  <antimatroid> yeah quite a lot of the heuristic side stuff has been moved in
2010-10-18T00:24:28  <antimatroid> still quite a few bugs i see in games too
2010-10-18T00:25:14  <rebelxt_> should you try multi-attacking on first turn? i.e. avoid tree search and use usual algorithm you used before, then switch to minimax
2010-10-18T00:25:15  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.83.182> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-18T00:27:29  <antimatroid> i think minimax works well first turn
2010-10-18T00:27:33  *** Olathe <Olathe!~Olathe@unaffiliated/olathe> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-18T00:27:44  <antimatroid> just try a combination of planets to take for each player
2010-10-18T00:28:04  <antimatroid> you can change up what moves are picked dependent on the state of the game etc. too
2010-10-18T00:28:06  <rwa> as long as your search tree considers 1-N moves, minimax is good for start because it handles close/far automatically
2010-10-18T00:28:07  <antimatroid> it's fairly flexible
2010-10-18T00:28:09  <rebelxt_> true, but branch factor is huge since bots normally attack 4-6 planets on first turn
2010-10-18T00:28:30  <antimatroid> i have it checking just up to 4 to take atm
2010-10-18T00:28:37  <antimatroid> and it usually seems to pick just 1 or 2
2010-10-18T00:28:45  <antimatroid> but it will then back them up and expand when they get tehre
2010-10-18T00:29:42  <antimatroid> as soon as we got our minimax bot up and running for tron it was making it into first place on the official server towards the end of the comp
2010-10-18T00:29:59  <antimatroid> but it was a lot easier to get that right
2010-10-18T00:30:35  <rebelxt_> yeah, tron was so much simpler

2010-10-18T00:33:51  <antimatroid> i was drawing out trees to debug with tron, that was painful enough
2010-10-18T00:35:19  <rebelxt_> i will generate some really simple maps - hopefully easier to debug

2010-10-18T17:11:38  <javagamer> rebelxt, seems a little odd to be using a closed source IDE on linux, but obviously open source doesn't always have everything a closed source product does
2010-10-18T17:11:45  <javagamer> rebelxt, yeah, as far as I can tell
2010-10-18T17:12:04  <lavalamp_> jedit's highlighting is at least easy to fix if it needs it

2010-10-18T18:55:33  <bhasker> the problem is with how i changed when i send ships forward

2010-10-18T18:56:05  <McLeopold> hmm... that corner planet would be tough to hold since he is much closer.
2010-10-18T18:56:46  <SkyDream> you lose on turn 14 when attaking first the central planet ...

2010-10-18T18:59:24  <McLeopold> 76 is a bit steep for the first turn
2010-10-18T19:00:50  <rebelxt> bhasker: you might have mis-calculated how much aid opponent can send to the neutral vs your max reinforcement (including time to make profit into account)
2010-10-18T19:00:51  <McLeopold> RamBot wins against voidptr. :)  It's must not be too bad.
2010-10-18T19:01:16  <rebelxt> is it a python bot? it can't be bad by definition!
2010-10-18T19:01:33  <McLeopold> You haven't watched MoldBot, have you?
2010-10-18T19:01:34  <bhasker> probably
2010-10-18T19:01:39  <SkyDream> is it better to first arrange planets in trees to make faster search ?
2010-10-18T19:01:43  <bhasker> will have to check the logs later
2010-10-18T19:02:59  <rebelxt> i recall crow and ant, but not mold ;)
2010-10-18T19:03:15  <rebelxt> RamBot's games are fun to watch on fast forward
2010-10-18T19:03:41  <McLeopold> MoldBot looked like a drunk deepblue.
2010-10-18T19:03:49  <rebelxt> rofl
2010-10-18T19:04:08  <McLeopold> fast forward? what viewer are you using?
2010-10-18T19:04:35  <SkyDream> is it any way to test my bot on windows ?
2010-10-18T19:04:51  <rebelxt> i just keep right button pushed down in the stock canvas visualizer
2010-10-18T19:04:57  <McLeopold> SkyDream: all the java tools should work the same.

2010-10-18T20:55:34  <phreeza> my tree searching experiments
2010-10-18T20:55:45  <phreeza> phreeza is my heuristic bot
2010-10-18T20:56:33  <cfaftw> i can't believe it [would have] lost that match
2010-10-18T20:56:48  <cfaftw> on turn 12 it had a /huge/ advantage
2010-10-18T20:57:48  <phreeza> yea... it is a dimwit, as the name says :)
2010-10-18T20:58:04  <phreeza> its good at that type of opening
2010-10-18T20:58:19  <phreeza> but as soon as the game gets more complex, its lost
2010-10-18T20:58:48  <cfaftw> maybe have it switch to heuristic-bot at a certain threshold

2010-10-18T21:00:20  <phreeza> but for now i'm going to see how far i can push this search by itself... later on i will try and merge the best aspects of my bots into one
2010-10-18T21:00:41  <phreeza> i'm also thinking about a case based reasoning variant

2010-10-18T21:48:07  <rebelxt_> c++ is too slow! ;-) development time, not runtime
2010-10-18T21:48:24  <cfaftw> and i don't know C++, so it must be bad!

2010-10-18T21:49:05  <dmj111> McLeopold: good to hear about the tcp client.  its pretty barebones.  I have been working on other stuff lately, and haven't gotten to mess with anything else in a while.
2010-10-18T21:49:11  <cfaftw> i probably should learn C++ one of these days...
2010-10-18T21:49:30  <dmj111> it has it's nice points.
2010-10-18T21:49:54  <dmj111> mostly making me like Python more :P  (sorry c++ guys, I am mostly kidding...)
2010-10-18T21:50:13  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-18T21:50:26  <dmj111> i have still probably written more C++ than Python code in my life.
2010-10-18T21:50:49  <rebelxt_> if tree search is not a dead end, then porting to c++ will help performance a lot.. but it's always possible to do it in the last few days in Nov
2010-10-18T21:51:37  <dmj111> i tried porting my tron bot to c++, but gave up.  It was not fun.
2010-10-18T21:51:58  <rebelxt_> cfaftw: i'm using psyco now (either you or dmj suggested this to me), it helped a bit
2010-10-18T21:52:24  <cfaftw> who won the tron contest? is he in this contest?
2010-10-18T21:52:28  <dmj111> a1k0n
2010-10-18T21:52:39  <cfaftw> oh
2010-10-18T21:53:06  <dmj111> he is in the contest, but I am not sure he is really working on it.  I am hoping he is playing minecraft instead.
2010-10-18T21:53:38  <rebelxt_> dmj111: it is pure torture. have you used shedskin for python to c++ translation? it works well when it works - i could not use it for my bot :(
2010-10-18T21:53:59  <rebelxt_> dmj111: lol
2010-10-18T21:54:28  <cfaftw> i've been playing minecraft
2010-10-18T21:54:49  <cfaftw> but it hasn't detracted from my work on this contest
2010-10-18T21:54:50  <rebelxt_> i hear about minecraft more and more, but still resisting getting into it
2010-10-18T21:54:54  <cfaftw> ... yet
2010-10-18T21:55:21  <dmj111> cfaftw: here is the leaderboard from tron.  a1kon was 90 points ahead of second place at the end.

2010-10-18T21:59:37  <dmj111> rebelxt_: I have not used shedskin.  I used to use SWIG a lot so I could test my C++ from python.
2010-10-18T21:59:38  <antimatroid> dmj111: down to 5th on main site :P
2010-10-18T21:59:46  <cfaftw> man
2010-10-18T21:59:55  <cfaftw> i want to do the tr0n contest
2010-10-18T22:00:10  <dmj111> yeah.  I do not put a lot of faith in the rating system.  So few games.
2010-10-18T22:00:36  <dmj111> I could easily be 20th, or 50th, in reality, not 5th.
2010-10-18T22:00:42  <antimatroid> tron was an awesome game for ai
2010-10-18T22:00:44  <rebelxt_> yeah elo fluctuates too much when playing 2-5 games per day
2010-10-18T22:00:51  <antimatroid> although in the end a little boring that minimax reined

2010-10-18T22:02:40  <dmj111> depth first searches to find connected components and longest paths was _not_ fun in python.  I love recursive functions, but had to unwind a bunch of graph algorithms to fit in the stack limit.
2010-10-18T22:02:56  <dmj111> That was the reason I was thinking of switching to C++ then.
2010-10-18T22:03:08  <rebelxt_> dmj111: shedskin only works if program is implicitly statically typed :(
