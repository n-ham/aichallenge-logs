2011-06-09T01:50:33  <stocha> @later tell janzert it would be interesting to have an official test server, where multiple submissions are possible. For testing ideas and features against a variety of opponents. I think after all, it is better than the tcp thing for real condition testing.
2011-06-09T01:50:33  <contestbot> stocha: Aye, aye, sir

2011-06-09T02:04:11  <stocha> rabidus: the usual way i guess.
2011-06-09T02:04:56  <stocha> you spend 10 days building each test case, only to find out after a minor modification, no test case make sense anymore. usual stuff.
2011-06-09T02:05:53  <stocha> the other strategy is to build your own implementation of the game server and graphical view, and test on those. (i did just that)
2011-06-09T02:07:14  <stocha> who has the knowledge and access to the test serveur, and can help with all thoses bot that do not load properly ?

2011-06-09T03:59:52  <janzert> simply redirecting stderr is going to hide genuine errors as well
2011-06-09T04:03:18  <aerique> janzert: yeah, you're right.
2011-06-09T04:03:38  <aerique> i kinda copied the blunt method we used for planet wars
2011-06-09T04:04:26  <aerique> i'm always fighting with disabling the right warnings in sbcl, but i guess i'll have to dive into it
2011-06-09T04:04:26  <janzert> and maybe it really is the best option, it'd be nice if it wasn't though ;)
2011-06-09T04:05:06  <janzert> is there a simple command line switch to disable all of them?
2011-06-09T04:05:12  <aerique> no :(
2011-06-09T04:05:20  <janzert> too bad :(
2011-06-09T04:05:57  <aerique> i'm not actually running into it with the starter bot, i added the note at mcstar's request.  i think he build his own package
2011-06-09T04:06:15  * janzert nods
2011-06-09T04:06:17  <aerique> i'm using a build system which avoids most of the problems
2011-06-09T04:07:17  <aerique> i keep the note for now.  i'll start testing my own bot soon and see what i'll run into and fix it properly
2011-06-09T04:07:33  <janzert> maybe include in the note the downside and mention that if the build fails it would probably be best to resubmit with the redirection disabled so there is the possibility of getting a helpful error message

2011-06-09T06:37:07  <sir_macelon> now ants will tend to forget about food when they lose vision over it?
2011-06-09T06:38:13  <sir_macelon> this introduces some new shitty calculations to keep that information...
2011-06-09T06:40:06  <sir_macelon> i will have to update the java starter bot as well
2011-06-09T06:41:12  <antimatroid> sir_macelon: i made these arguments, apparently it's not that much work :\
2011-06-09T06:41:18  <sigh> the r is easy to compute for the bot, and it was really confusing to explain to people
2011-06-09T06:41:35  <sigh> the second point was the main thing
2011-06-09T06:41:50  <antimatroid> just make the starter bots forget food information once they go out of view though

2011-06-09T06:50:58  <sir_macelon> hopefully i can keep the food which i don't see
2011-06-09T06:51:25  <sir_macelon> but can i rely on that 'a' lines are always send before 'f' lines?
2011-06-09T06:51:38  <sir_macelon> *sent
2011-06-09T06:52:37  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2011-06-09T06:53:45  <sir_macelon> i can calulate the vision at the time of parsing then
2011-06-09T06:54:56  <sir_macelon> when i read the information about all ants then i know which of them doesn't see the food and then keep it
2011-06-09T06:55:12  <sir_macelon> before starting processing the food information
2011-06-09T06:55:15  <antimatroid1> oh, i wouldn't count on it
2011-06-09T06:55:23  <antimatroid1> read all data before doing anything
2011-06-09T06:55:41  <antimatroid1> it's messy to do well
2011-06-09T06:56:09  <antimatroid1> i didn't like moving to the format partially because of that reason, came up with the 'r' lines to avoid it and lost the argument for keeping them :P
2011-06-09T06:57:38  <sir_macelon> i would have kept it...
2011-06-09T06:57:44  <antimatroid1> same :P
2011-06-09T06:58:01  <antimatroid1> but, it's not the worst thing that could have happened
2011-06-09T06:58:10  <antimatroid1> once you've handled it, it's done
2011-06-09T06:58:38  <sir_macelon> yeah, well :)
2011-06-09T06:59:07  <sir_macelon> wanted to focus on more fancy things :)
2011-06-09T06:59:15  <Frontier> So this weekend we are finally starting the contest?
2011-06-09T06:59:22  <antimatroid1> we are?
2011-06-09T06:59:30  <Frontier> are we?
2011-06-09T06:59:31  <antimatroid1> crap, i need to do something about the c++ timer
2011-06-09T06:59:40  <antimatroid1> bloody windows
2011-06-09T07:00:07  <antimatroid1> bloody non mingw using windows users*
2011-06-09T07:01:34  <Frontier> Well even under Linux & MacOS there are more accurate functions for timing now that aren't compatible with each other
2011-06-09T07:02:29  <antimatroid1> i'm tempted to just take the timer out and tell individual users to deal with it
2011-06-09T07:02:45  <antimatroid1> i could even just a couple of timers in the forums, one for mac/linux another for windows
2011-06-09T07:04:31  <antimatroid1> lol, would it be terrible if i defined a different Timer structure depending on whether windows32 was defined?
2011-06-09T07:04:42  <antimatroid1> and have each one with the same functions ?
2011-06-09T07:08:57  <sir_macelon> bloody c++ :)
2011-06-09T07:10:31  <antimatroid1> it's all fun and games until you worry about operator precedence, templates and cross platformability :P
2011-06-09T07:10:42  <Frontier> antimatroid1: That would not be terrible at all. That's what I would expect anyway
2011-06-09T07:11:04  <antimatroid1> alright, i have a new task for the night
2011-06-09T07:16:49  <berak> antimatroid1, please throw out the timer. and the buglog, too, since the engine is already logging stderr perfectly
2011-06-09T07:17:15  <antimatroid1> berak: it's easy to throw out yourself
2011-06-09T07:17:22  <antimatroid1> it's there to make life easier for people who probably couldn't write it themselves

2011-06-09T07:21:48  <berak> sorry, did not want to sound that harsh.
2011-06-09T07:22:28  <antimatroid1> s'all good
2011-06-09T07:22:32  <antimatroid1> it is annoying when they use the same file
2011-06-09T07:22:39  <antimatroid1> it was annoying in planet wars with just 2 of them :P
2011-06-09T07:30:36  <berak> antimatroid1: you posted some c++ game library to the forum, did you ever try to hook that up to a general game player ?
2011-06-09T07:31:35  <antimatroid1> berak: it's possible to use a State with comparison operations if one wanted, but it'd be much more efficient to rewrite your own specific game object
2011-06-09T07:31:44  <antimatroid1> it's more for general game theory stuff
2011-06-09T07:32:47  <berak> k, i see

2011-06-09T07:35:08  <antimatroid1> are you familiar with game theory?
2011-06-09T07:35:49  <berak> no, i just got interested during pw, and started collecting stuff
2011-06-09T07:37:58  <berak> remember the big black hole, after pw finished ? ;)
2011-06-09T07:38:43  <Frontier> Wow there must be 100 parodies on different topics over a scene from the movie "Der Untergang" on YouTube. I whish I couldn't understand what they talk and just rely on the sub-titles.
2011-06-09T07:39:05  <antimatroid1> ah okay, well feel free to play with my game theory library some time anyway :P
2011-06-09T07:39:22  <antimatroid1> i need to upload the most recent stuff, i added back in two templates for game structures

2011-06-09T09:16:55  <smiley1983> If you're still using the first version of the ocaml starter, your bot might be susceptible to this bug
2011-06-09T09:17:05  <smiley1983> I can explain how to make it ignore the bad input
2011-06-09T09:18:36  <smiley1983> Also, does anyone know: is player_seed going to be official, or is it temporary? Does not seem to be mentioned in the spec.
2011-06-09T09:19:09  <antimatroid> in the parameters?
2011-06-09T09:19:13  <antimatroid> that is a bug if it's still being sent to players

2011-06-09T09:19:30  <antimatroid> smiley1983: was that ^^ how you were referring to do the timer in windows?
2011-06-09T09:19:43  <antimatroid> i am a little worried now about windows users stripping the second half out
2011-06-09T09:19:52  <UncleVasya> smiley1983:  You can give me a link to the page with colored changes in the file.
2011-06-09T09:20:26  <smiley1983> antimatroid: No, sorry, this was not connected to the timer problem
2011-06-09T09:20:44  <antimatroid> i know, but a week or two ago you said something to me about timers yeah?
2011-06-09T09:20:52  <antimatroid> i meant my previous link too sorry :P
2011-06-09T09:20:53  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: it's a one line change, easier to give it here, but I can pastebin the section if you prefer
2011-06-09T09:21:09  <UncleVasya> ok, give it here
2011-06-09T09:21:27  <smiley1983> Ants.ml, in function add_line
2011-06-09T09:21:48  <smiley1983> near the end, there is a line "failwith (blah)"
2011-06-09T09:22:00  <UncleVasya> You said it's only in the first version so I thought this fix already on the github.
2011-06-09T09:22:23  <smiley1983> Oh, yes, I'll go and find the line there. Sorry :)
2011-06-09T09:22:37  <smiley1983> antimatroid: yes, it was just a source code implementation of a timer function
2011-06-09T09:22:41  <UncleVasya> failwith (Printf.sprintf "unable to parse '%s'" line))))
2011-06-09T09:23:02  <smiley1983> Yes, it should be "Ants.ddebug (blah); gstate" instead
2011-06-09T09:23:12  <smiley1983> I'll go and find it on github
2011-06-09T09:23:37  <UncleVasya> Don't worry

2011-06-09T09:25:10  <smiley1983> The one on github replaces the whole debug output with just "gstate" - that is, it silently ignores the input and returns the game state unmodified

2011-06-09T09:26:55  <UncleVasya> But I've change my decision and came here to cry "rankings is broken!". And never thought to look at the bot and find an issue :(

2011-06-09T09:30:36  <smiley1983> does it use A* ?
2011-06-09T09:30:42  <berak> but my local ranking is always: stocha cellular antstar hungry
2011-06-09T09:30:44  <berak> yes
2011-06-09T09:30:48  <antimatroid> meh, i'm still out on A*
2011-06-09T09:30:49  <smiley1983> :)
2011-06-09T09:31:49  <smiley1983> I can see how it might be useful. My ants will follow a sub-optimal path if sent on a long journey using my current pathfinding system.
2011-06-09T09:32:25  <antimatroid> none of my intended strategies involve a single target for something
2011-06-09T09:33:24  <antimatroid> pretty good representation from antarctica so far :P
2011-06-09T09:33:46  <stocha> the ranking are mostly random right now.
2011-06-09T09:35:40  <stocha> berak : what is your local ranking ?
2011-06-09T09:35:51  <stocha> how is it done
2011-06-09T09:36:30  <berak> haven't got trueskill working yet, so i just average scores
2011-06-09T09:36:47  <stocha> but where the bots come from ?
2011-06-09T09:37:01  <berak> ?
2011-06-09T09:37:13  <stocha> The ranking on the test server is broken, because a lot of bot randomly crash at the start of the game.
2011-06-09T09:37:22  <smiley1983> Am I right in thinking it's okay to include open source library code with your bot?
2011-06-09T09:37:48  <stocha> berak: are your running the bots on your own machine ? Are you using stats from the test server ?
2011-06-09T09:38:00  <antimatroid> smiley1983: pretty sure
2011-06-09T09:38:04  <berak> on my machine
2011-06-09T09:38:08  <stocha> smiley1983: it is as long as your bot is open source :)
2011-06-09T09:38:25  <stocha> are cellular and hungry form git maybe ?
2011-06-09T09:38:29  <stocha> from
2011-06-09T09:38:57  <stocha> smiley1983: so when you submit it, doesn't forget to join the source hehe :p
2011-06-09T09:39:16  <berak> no, mine, and yours is sto003_AdaptToContestbotLk , from the forum
2011-06-09T09:39:25  <stocha> okay.
2011-06-09T09:39:44  <smiley1983> Hm, that's a good point. GPL code might be problematic, fortunately the Mersenne library I want is LGPL :)
2011-06-09T09:39:49  <stocha> at this point stocha bot and a few other always win (1 or 2) when they do not crash.
2011-06-09T09:40:07  <stocha> and they crash randomly about 50% of the time.
2011-06-09T09:40:31  <stocha> java bot mostly crash because the jvm doesn't want to launch.
2011-06-09T09:41:01  <antimatroid> berak: what's your opinion on the scoring for the games in general?
2011-06-09T09:41:04  <antimatroid> does it work/make sense?
2011-06-09T09:41:04  <berak> so, seems you have to do your own ranking calculatzion, excluding those
2011-06-09T09:41:12  <stocha> Anyway, in the submission, we do join the code. because we submit the code. So open source is okay :)
2011-06-09T09:41:34  <berak> if i only knew !
2011-06-09T09:41:42  <stocha> scoring seems to make sense, in that it follow the number of ant most of time :p
2011-06-09T09:41:57  <stocha> and the order of elimination also.
2011-06-09T09:42:48  <stocha> berak : it's hard to compare java bots together (and other crashing bots) because they very rarely play each other without on crashing
2011-06-09T09:43:35  * antimatroid makes yet another random poke at java
2011-06-09T09:43:56  <smiley1983> I think it's impossible to get a good sense of how well the ranking system works with so many crashes
2011-06-09T09:44:10  <berak> also, if i look at antstars latest games, it had a long streak of luck mostly against starterbots.
2011-06-09T09:44:33  <smiley1983> Also, even the non-crashbots can be pretty random at the moment.
2011-06-09T09:44:51  <berak> pairing is coupled to ranking, some kind of feedback loop
2011-06-09T09:44:57  <stocha> smiley1983: i'm afraid you are right. But for that it show that the ranking is hardly consistent when bots are randomly very strong/very weak :)
2011-06-09T09:44:58  <stocha> some are at least
2011-06-09T09:46:49  <stocha> what option do you launch the jvm with ?
2011-06-09T09:46:57  <stocha> if somebody knows.
2011-06-09T09:47:08  *** Eruonen <Eruonen!~Its@e198153.upc-e.chello.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-09T09:49:14  <stocha> my guess is the jvm is launch with asking too much memory. so it doesn't load.
2011-06-09T09:49:32  <stocha> but for the first bots, wich have access to enough memory
2011-06-09T09:49:34  <berak> server has not enough ram
2011-06-09T09:49:42  <berak> known issue
2011-06-09T09:49:42  <stocha> so one fix would be to reduced the asked memory for jvm.
2011-06-09T09:49:58  <stocha> and then they would either not crash, or they would crash when allocating memory.
2011-06-09T09:50:13  <stocha> i guess at this point few bot will use very much memory anyway.
2011-06-09T09:50:30  <stocha> and if those crash, they will crash with consistency. wich is better.
2011-06-09T09:50:56  <stocha> so make it the max jvm memory like 100 mb
2011-06-09T09:51:11  <stocha> and then they will either work, or crash with consistency.
2011-06-09T09:51:39  <stocha> i have no idea who can do this though. who is in charge of the server, and has access to it ?
2011-06-09T09:52:35  <janzert> stocha: that has already been tried, in fact 100mb was exactly tried, it seems the jvm doesn't strictly obey it
2011-06-09T09:52:50  <janzert> and refuses to start with less than 800mb anyway
2011-06-09T09:52:54  <stocha> can i have a look at the params ?
2011-06-09T09:53:08  <janzert> they're in compiler.py
2011-06-09T09:53:09  <stocha> jvm silently ignore params if they are not right.
2011-06-09T09:53:23  <stocha> i'll try to have a look
2011-06-09T09:53:47  <stocha> janzert: do you have access to test server ?
2011-06-09T09:54:53  <janzert> yes
2011-06-09T09:54:55  <berak> janzert, and the runtime settings are where ?
2011-06-09T09:55:36  <janzert> berak: not sure which you mean, but server_info files
2011-06-09T09:55:56  <janzert> is where the server configuration is stored
2011-06-09T09:57:09  <berak> because you invoke java once for compiling, and another time for running the bot in the sandbox,
2011-06-09T09:57:57  <stocha> isn't compiler.py for compiling ?
2011-06-09T09:58:16  <stocha> ah i see berak is already inquiring :p
2011-06-09T09:58:23  <stocha> so i'll leave it to berak :p
2011-06-09T09:58:42  <janzert> compiler.py has the full language definitions
2011-06-09T09:59:00  <janzert> including the command line to run the submission after compilation
2011-06-09T09:59:06  <Zaphus> Does the ranking get recalculated for a bot even if it doesnt enter any matches ?    mine hasnt seen a game for 11 hours and has dropped from 54 to 48
2011-06-09T10:00:53  <Zaphus> 'George' was in a similar position, no games for 15 hours and dropped 4 points in that time (has now played a game that scored 0.00 so can't really judge after that)
2011-06-09T10:04:06  <janzert> Zaphus: yes, the sigma will gradually increase which will cause a decline in the displayed skill
2011-06-09T10:10:53  <Zaphus> that's going to be annoying, even if correct - because you have no control over it.   would love to see a matchmaking system that doesnt leave one bot with no games while others play 10 in the same time period
2011-06-09T10:11:59  <stocha> especially when the ranking is not demonstrated not to be random yet.

2011-06-09T10:14:51  <stocha> janzert: what i would do, is try to launch a simple looping java program, and aknoledge how small the jvm process can be (trying 100m seems fine though)

2011-06-09T10:15:40  <antimatroid> if you add an "oldFood" vector/set, then after processing vision information you can just check those locations for whether they're visible and if not make that location food
2011-06-09T10:15:43  <stocha> can i have an access to the server ? or someone that know jvm stuff well
2011-06-09T10:15:57  <stocha> i'm not a master at the thing to say the least.
2011-06-09T10:16:10  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: If I'll need to use an A* i think I can use "when a free ant was in this cell last time" as a cost heuristic function.
2011-06-09T10:16:10  <berak> antimatroid:  do not eat old food! ( what was that ? )
2011-06-09T10:16:23  <antimatroid> what?
2011-06-09T10:16:40  <berak> ah, seems you pinged the wrong one
2011-06-09T10:16:41  <antimatroid> oldFood is my food vector/set from the last turn
2011-06-09T10:17:04  <antimatroid> it's probably not the most efficient, but at the start of the turn it's fairly negligable
2011-06-09T10:18:06  <janzert> stocha: also it only has actually about 13mb resident but it has over 700mb of virtual space
2011-06-09T10:18:30  <antimatroid> lol virtual space with 1sec time limits?
2011-06-09T10:19:04  <antimatroid> i think the engine should send the bots a time limit just under what it actually uses
2011-06-09T10:19:05  <janzert> normally I'd say the virtual space is unimportant anyway but I guess for some reason with the virtualization method the server is running under it takes it all into account
2011-06-09T10:19:32  <janzert> antimatroid: virtual space is basically the address space a program uses
2011-06-09T10:19:49  <antimatroid> have you guys tried upping the start time limit for the beta server for java bots?
2011-06-09T10:20:03  <antimatroid> or is jvm literally crashing/not having enough memory?
2011-06-09T10:20:08  <janzert> antimatroid: it crashes instantally, more time wouldn't do much
2011-06-09T10:20:13  <antimatroid> ah yeah okay
2011-06-09T10:20:32  <janzert> instantly even
2011-06-09T10:21:03  <antimatroid> who is antimatter?
2011-06-09T10:21:07  <stocha> can you trying launching any looping java program (let's say a bot) without any parameter for the jvm ?
2011-06-09T10:21:23  <stocha> and report how much memory the jvm process take ?
2011-06-09T10:21:31  <stocha> then try to play a bit with parameter.
2011-06-09T10:22:10  <stocha> i expect the single -Xmx100m single parameter to give a Jvm that take about 100m of real memory.
2011-06-09T10:22:20  <stocha> or less.
2011-06-09T10:22:47  <antimatroid> berak knocked out of first place :P
2011-06-09T10:22:53  <stocha> then we can digin in why the tournament have it wrong, once we know the server default are okay.

2011-06-09T10:26:19  <Zaphus> stocha:  Ranking isnt random, it's the lack of balance in the matchups  (plus the inequity in starting positions on some maps, but thats another story).   I'm reading the matchup code and I'm struggling with i
2011-06-09T10:28:17  <Zaphus> there's a line in the player selection that implies every player gets to be the seed before it starts the list again, which means you'd be getting 4+ games every 60 games right now (once as seed, the rest as opponents)... but I'm seeing gaps of over 200 games for some bots, so thats not doing what I'd imagine it was meant to do

2011-06-09T10:30:59  <berak> someone here, who uses the same setup as the server does ( i mean not starting playgame.py, but worker ) ?
2011-06-09T10:32:29  <stocha> Zaphus: the random is random. Even if the ranking algorithm works. Because some bot are strong enougth to win against the number 1. in rank if they launch, and loose agains the weakest, when they do not launch (about 50% of the time)
2011-06-09T10:32:35  <stocha> ranking is random
2011-06-09T10:32:56  <janzert> stocha: I don't have a looping java program available, I can tell you "java -Xmx100m" crashes when there is 1851 of 2048MB of memory in use
2011-06-09T10:33:18  <janzert> stocha: if that's what you mean by ranking is random then it's not a fault of the ranking system
2011-06-09T10:33:22  <Zaphus> stocha:  ranking algorithm isnt random then, the bots behaviour is random
2011-06-09T10:35:19  <stocha> It may not be the fault of the ranking system true. at this point :p
2011-06-09T10:35:35  <stocha> but the raking page show random results. That's what i meant.

2011-06-09T10:36:06  <stocha> you have a looping java programe : the starter java bot.
2011-06-09T10:36:06  <janzert> I'd say it is correct results though :)
2011-06-09T10:36:18  <janzert> for the way the bots are actually performing
2011-06-09T10:36:27  <stocha> correct, but non converging at the moment.
2011-06-09T10:36:48  <Zaphus> stocha: the ranking is not useful, but it's accurate :-)  if the bots were allowed to behave properly, it would be better.
2011-06-09T10:36:58  <Zaphus> anyone understand the SQL code for matches ?
2011-06-09T10:36:59  <stocha> i take it a good ranking algorithm would converge, somehow. maybe that's utopia :p
2011-06-09T10:38:29  <Zaphus> stocha:  It converges to a point (a confidence level if you like) - beyond that it would only converge if every single game went with predictable results - and sometimes games dont go the way you expect
2011-06-09T10:38:32  <deltOr> stocha: Only if there is a "true" ranking
2011-06-09T10:38:42  <deltOr> generally there is not
2011-06-09T10:39:04  <deltOr> ie A>B B>C does not imply A>C
2011-06-09T10:39:22  <deltOr> while a rank does imply this

2011-06-09T10:53:51  <stocha> a > b | a< c | b > c
2011-06-09T10:54:06  <stocha> doesn't have to be transitive
2011-06-09T10:54:14  <deltOr> but that is not a rankl
2011-06-09T10:54:16  <deltOr> rank
2011-06-09T10:54:25  <stocha> ah. i though it was :)
2011-06-09T10:54:26  <deltOr> rank implies a ordered list
2011-06-09T10:54:45  <stocha> For me a rank is a probability of winning for one player against each other player.
2011-06-09T10:54:45  <deltOr> at least that is what everyone else is typically talking about
2011-06-09T10:55:02  <deltOr> ie i am ranked 1st
2011-06-09T10:55:09  <deltOr> not ranked [matrix]
2011-06-09T10:55:14  <stocha> i think what i call rank is a good way of ranking bots :p
2011-06-09T10:56:06  <stocha> although it assumes there exists a static probability of winning for each pair of players.
2011-06-09T10:57:00  <stocha> when its transitive, you can build a list. and when it has cycles, they player should have the same rank i guess.
2011-06-09T10:57:08  <deltOr> and if the matrix has over 1000 rows and columns its really isn't a rank even in the most abstract mathematical sense
2011-06-09T10:57:34  <stocha> well the rank can be deduced straight forward from above method :p
2011-06-09T10:57:52  <stocha> if transitive, rank them, if cycle, rank all the same for the cycle.
2011-06-09T10:58:18  <stocha> every good ranking should converge to that.
2011-06-09T10:58:53  <deltOr> have more than 3 players... and cycles does not even begin to cover the possibilities
2011-06-09T10:59:07  <stocha> arguably you can have more complex method for cycles but well.
2011-06-09T10:59:14  <antimatroid> berak: why don't you use namespace std in .cc files?
2011-06-09T10:59:32  <stocha> i think i have read something about ranking multiple features (aka players)
2011-06-09T10:59:43  <deltOr> antimatroid: because about 60% of C++ coders don't know about or don't like namespaces
2011-06-09T10:59:58  <antimatroid> but it makes life much easier
2011-06-09T11:00:07  <berak> antimatroid: what ? how would you know ?

2011-06-09T11:00:15  <antimatroid> std::cout << "hello" << std::endl; is gross

2011-06-09T11:01:31  <antimatroid> i will accept people's argument for not putting them in .h, although really you shouldn't be overloading std names anyway, but why not in .cc?
2011-06-09T11:01:37  <berak> can't remember saying that. but 'using namespace std;' in a header is bad
2011-06-09T11:01:45  <antimatroid> yes, but in .cc it's fine
2011-06-09T11:02:23  <antimatroid> you don't force people using your library to use it if it's in .cc
2011-06-09T11:02:37  <stocha> basically it assumes he want to know the probability of winning of each players against every other. and use match of team vs team.
2011-06-09T11:03:03  <stocha> it then apply i didn't understood what algorithm, and voilà. Seems to work well.
2011-06-09T11:03:11  <janzert> stocha: it's a sort of seminal/classic? work now about ranking go board features by having them compete in a tournament, several of the top tier bots use it now
2011-06-09T11:03:43  <stocha> it should work for ranking bots. if it works for team of bot features.
2011-06-09T11:03:54  <stocha> i mean rank team of bots.
2011-06-09T11:04:13  <janzert> pretty sure it'd be way to compute intensive for us
2011-06-09T11:04:16  <stocha> ah maybe we don't have teams in the contests. mmm, okay i'm probably wrong then :p
2011-06-09T11:04:32  <stocha> ah yeah, it may be compute intensive too :p
2011-06-09T11:04:42  <stocha> although i'm not sure of that.
2011-06-09T11:04:47  <stocha> because there will not be many matches anyway.
2011-06-09T11:05:02  <stocha> not many game played i mean.
2011-06-09T11:05:20  <stocha> per hour.
2011-06-09T11:05:49  <stocha> still it's not straight forward to apply it to the tournament setting.
2011-06-09T11:06:08  <janzert> off the top of my head I recall it being a global minorization/maximization bradley-terry model
2011-06-09T11:06:44  <janzert> basically what bayeselo uses too
2011-06-09T11:07:09  <janzert> which isn't surprising since it's the same author :)
2011-06-09T11:07:11  <stocha> yeah. but it uses more sofisticated algorithm to have team of features
2011-06-09T11:07:34  <stocha> wich enable efficiency
2011-06-09T11:07:59  <stocha> maybe we should ask him what ranking system he would propose for the contest ? :)

2011-06-09T11:10:53  <stocha> really look neardy yes :p
2011-06-09T11:11:24  <janzert> I rather wish he would start entering crazystone in the monthly kgs tournaments, zen has just been dominating all year
2011-06-09T11:11:56  <stocha> i didn't follow computer go for like two years.
2011-06-09T11:12:04  <stocha> it was getting dispressing :p
2011-06-09T11:12:19  <janzert> for the humans?
2011-06-09T11:12:20  <smiley1983> berak: you asked if I was here, I think. I am now, and yes, I've got a server running games with worker
2011-06-09T11:13:34  <stocha> i mean there was the mogo revolution (with Amaf and stuff). and crazystone was on par with it. And then it was all engineering, and nothing really new.
2011-06-09T11:13:39  <stocha> so i got bored.
2011-06-09T11:13:46  <janzert> hehe
2011-06-09T11:14:12  <berak> i had this theory, that the java bots are called with different params when compiling, and when being run in a sandbox, but could not test it.
2011-06-09T11:14:46  <stocha> it would be good to see the exact launching command
2011-06-09T11:15:03  <stocha> and try it independently of the contest
2011-06-09T11:15:21  <stocha> can't someone modify the script, so it log the launching command for bots ? :p
2011-06-09T11:15:41  <janzert> berak: line 227/228 of compiler.py is the compilation command and line 309 is the command when running for a game
2011-06-09T11:15:51  <stocha> janzert: what was the exact command that crashed with -Xmx100m ?
2011-06-09T11:15:54  <janzert> stocha: just look at them in compiler.py
2011-06-09T11:16:04  <janzert> "java -Xmx100m"
2011-06-09T11:16:13  <stocha> i understand nuts to compiler.py
2011-06-09T11:16:24  <stocha> java -Xmx100m should show you the java syntax
2011-06-09T11:16:40  <janzert> right it should print the usage/help stuff and exit
2011-06-09T11:16:42  <janzert> it doesn't
2011-06-09T11:17:00  <janzert> it crashes with messages about not being able to allocate memory
2011-06-09T11:17:08  <stocha> try java -version
2011-06-09T11:17:17  <stocha> or
2011-06-09T11:18:10  <deltOr> that should be a big M
2011-06-09T11:18:17  <deltOr> java -Xmx500M
2011-06-09T11:18:27  <stocha> try -Xms50m -Xmx100m -Xmn50m
2011-06-09T11:18:33  <janzert> deltOr: I tried it both ways
2011-06-09T11:18:43  <stocha> java -Xms50m -Xmx100m -Xmn50m
2011-06-09T11:19:06  <deltOr> java --help works
2011-06-09T11:19:20  <deltOr> but by the sounds you may be using openjdk
2011-06-09T11:19:25  <stocha> i mean try to set memory for the three at the same time.
2011-06-09T11:19:37  <janzert> yes, openjdk
2011-06-09T11:19:45  <stocha> java -Xms100m -Xmx100m -Xmn50m
2011-06-09T11:19:56  <stocha> with 50m i got an error message too
2011-06-09T11:20:13  <stocha> 100/100/50 work there
2011-06-09T11:20:19  <deltOr> you would save yourself quite a bit of pain by using the jdk from sun/oracle
2011-06-09T11:20:34  <deltOr> there are still a lot of bugs in openjdk
2011-06-09T11:20:36  <stocha> i never had problem with open jdk though.
2011-06-09T11:21:01  <stocha> assuming it is the default on unbuntu
2011-06-09T11:21:23  <janzert> I'm really not too interested in putting much time into it since it works fine on a server with enough memory
2011-06-09T11:21:39  <deltOr> janzert: yea--
2011-06-09T11:21:41  <stocha> then give access to someone.
2011-06-09T11:21:56  <janzert> talk to amstan about it
2011-06-09T11:22:06  <stocha> beta testing with bot randomly loosing playing seems a bit hard :p
2011-06-09T11:22:29  <stocha> i don't want to have the access myself. i'm not really good at solving those stuff after all.
2011-06-09T11:22:38  <janzert> it's not really meant to be bot beta testing though, it's server beta testing
2011-06-09T11:22:52  <stocha> yeah. but you need it to work to conclude anything.
2011-06-09T11:23:04  <stocha> don't tell me that every bot crashing is not a problem :)
2011-06-09T11:23:17  <janzert> I did with an ec2 worker and they were running fine
2011-06-09T11:23:27  <stocha> ec2 ?
2011-06-09T11:23:28  <janzert> it ran for most of monday
2011-06-09T11:23:42  <janzert> the amazon servers that will be used for the contest
2011-06-09T11:23:43  <deltOr> amazon instance
2011-06-09T11:24:35  <janzert> I'll probably bring another one up once I get the new sandbox code working well

2011-06-09T11:29:07  <berak> hmm, i'm still not convinced, that those params are actually used. worker.game() first recompiles the bot, then calls compiler.get_run_cmd(), which parses a run.sh for the actual cmdline
2011-06-09T11:30:11  <berak> (gave me a headache, and i'm probably wrong)
2011-06-09T11:31:02  <janzert> berak: see line 444 where run.sh is written
2011-06-09T11:31:25  <janzert> it writes out the language name and command line given in the language definition
2011-06-09T11:31:29  <berak> 444 of what file ?
2011-06-09T11:31:36  <janzert> of compiler.py
2011-06-09T11:31:52  <janzert> 445 is the actual write I guess

2011-06-09T11:38:44  <janzert> one thing that I am a surprised at looking at the server, I see it is set to 500MB for the memory limit at this point , java still showing 786M use dthough
2011-06-09T11:39:08  <janzert> not sure when or why that changed from 100MB

2011-06-09T11:44:45  <janzert> also something I'd like way more than finding a way to run java with less memory is a way to run it with less threads/processes
2011-06-09T11:46:07  <janzert> that does effect the real server setup and configuration
2011-06-09T11:47:51  <smiley1983> do most programs spawn multiple threads or processes without being asked, or is it just Java?
2011-06-09T11:48:05  <smiley1983> programs written in Java, that is
2011-06-09T11:48:17  <janzert> it's the java runtime itself doing it
2011-06-09T11:48:34  <smiley1983> ah, I see
2011-06-09T11:48:41  <janzert> and yes it's pretty much just java or at least java is the worst offender
2011-06-09T11:49:25  <janzert> it needs to be able to start at least 11 or 12 processes or it just crashes
2011-06-09T11:49:54  <smiley1983> lol
2011-06-09T11:50:23  <janzert> I can see a separate thread for GC and maybe JIT but a dozen seems rather ridiculous
2011-06-09T11:53:35  <Frontier> Sun must have a reason for that and I'd really like to know it now.

2011-06-09T11:57:16  <berak> but that stems from times, where the alternative was forking another process
2011-06-09T12:01:27  <sir_macelon> wtf? my submission does not compile due to jvm error?
2011-06-09T12:01:42  <sir_macelon> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=16
2011-06-09T12:02:21  <Frontier> berak: You are right, altough I tried to pick it out of context so people think it was the main design principle at Sun :p
2011-06-09T12:02:55  <janzert> sir_macelon: looks like the same memory problem java bots are having at game time
2011-06-09T12:02:59  <Frontier> sir_macelon: Why are you surprised? There is not enough memory available to run many JVMs
2011-06-09T12:03:27  <sir_macelon> But it didn't happen for the submissions yet
2011-06-09T12:03:48  <Frontier> That is an exception that is proof for the rule!
2011-06-09T12:04:14  <janzert> compilation happens between games so usually there is more memory available at that point

2011-06-09T12:04:41  <Frontier> I cannot compile the visualizer on that machine for example, because it uses Java. I have to do it on my PC and copy the compiled files over to the test server, hehe
2011-06-09T12:05:25  <Frontier> janzert: I didn't know that. Do the compiles run in parallel?
2011-06-09T12:05:32  <sir_macelon> so this means no new submissions for java, heh?
2011-06-09T12:05:41  <janzert> Frontier: no
2011-06-09T12:05:55  <Frontier> Maybe someone set a global memory limit for Java recently?
2011-06-09T12:06:04  <janzert> a worker gets one task at a time, either running a game or compiling/testing a new submission
2011-06-09T12:06:14  <sir_macelon> 5 failed submissions in a row. should i wait for my lucky moment? ;)
2011-06-09T12:07:53  <janzert> Frontier: or something else grew in usage, say mysql or apache started another worker process or something
2011-06-09T12:08:49  <Frontier> what is the "node" process???
2011-06-09T12:08:57  <janzert> javascript bot?
2011-06-09T12:09:24  <Frontier> ah ok. >600 mb virtual memory for that :)
2011-06-09T12:09:49  <sir_macelon> kill it! :)
2011-06-09T12:10:36  <Frontier> the apache processes,  ~10 of them use 130 mb vram each. since we only have 1024 mb that is a lot :)
2011-06-09T12:11:54  <sir_macelon> my bot also crashes all the time for about two hours now...
2011-06-09T12:12:04  <sir_macelon> something is wrong here...
2011-06-09T12:12:19  <Frontier> hmm something must be wrong in my math. if in openvz ram == virtual memory, then 10*130mb should already be more than available, but the server keeps running
2011-06-09T12:12:40  <sir_macelon> all last 7 games played crashed
2011-06-09T12:12:48  <Frontier> janzert: are the processes for low submission ids spawned first?
2011-06-09T12:13:05  <Frontier> that would depend on the sql result ordering of course
2011-06-09T12:13:59  <berak> Frontier: more work: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=18644
2011-06-09T12:14:54  <Frontier> omg the server uses 2 GB of memory while there is only 1 GB available and the other 1 GB is burst memory that can be taken back by openvz and crash apps randomly Oo
2011-06-09T12:15:36  <Frontier> It's good that we are almost ready to launch the contest on a /real/ server :)
2011-06-09T12:16:25  <Frontier> lol berak, were that 5 java processes spawning at once?
2011-06-09T12:16:56  <Frontier> c'mon, use a language with no virtual machine already :p
2011-06-09T12:17:32  <berak> no, another one http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=18636 console is not defined
2011-06-09T12:22:06  <Frontier> oh sorry, I forgot to upload something yesterday
2011-06-09T12:24:36  <berak> there was this other error, went like 'replaydata.map.data.61.length should be within [72 .. 72], but was found to be 68!' due to map-lines in the replay being truncated. did that get resolved ?

2011-06-09T12:28:06  <Frontier> But I am glad that the visualizer catches all the errors
2011-06-09T12:28:32  <berak> it's not the fault of the visualizer, the  map in the replay seems truncated
2011-06-09T12:29:13  <Frontier> Yeah row 61 is obviously missing 4 characters
2011-06-09T12:30:35  <Frontier> That is a very strange bug though. What should have stopped the engine or map generator from writing these last 4 bytes?

2011-06-09T12:47:22  <jmcarthur> janzert: umm... the sigma for all bots goes up every time there is a new submission?
2011-06-09T12:47:23  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold JSKill is crashing on some skill updates now because of an iteration limit being hit, not sure if it's because of the low draw probability it seems to have correlated with the new settings though

2011-06-09T12:47:34  <jmcarthur> janzert: shouldn't it just be for the newly submitted bots?
2011-06-09T12:47:52  <janzert> jmcarthur: yes, because you're less sure of how the bot performs against the overall population
2011-06-09T12:48:06  <jmcarthur> janzert: surely they don't increase everybody's sigma on xbox live just because they have a new subscriber...
2011-06-09T12:48:18  <janzert> no, they increase it constantly over time :)
2011-06-09T12:48:36  <jmcarthur> janzert: i thought it was just once between each game the player plays

2011-06-09T12:49:22  <janzert> it may actually be done just once, but the amount is a function of time
2011-06-09T12:49:27  <jmcarthur> sure
2011-06-09T12:49:55  <jmcarthur> but i'm pretty sure it's not a function of how many new players there are in the system
2011-06-09T12:49:59  <janzert> we could technically do the same thing, it's just the way mcleopold implemented and probably easier this way
2011-06-09T12:50:32  <janzert> for us since the bots don't vary in performance over time it makes more sense to do by number of different submissions it faces
2011-06-09T12:50:48  <janzert> think of it as a different measure of time ;)
2011-06-09T12:51:18  <jmcarthur> aren't new submissions supposed to have high sigma anyway? i don't see why their opponents must also increase sigma just because they are there
2011-06-09T12:51:26  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-09T12:51:47  <janzert> remember the skill number is just a relative measure against the rest of the population
2011-06-09T12:52:05  <janzert> since the population changes your relative skill is less certain
2011-06-09T12:52:15  <janzert> and yes new submissions are always given a large sigma
2011-06-09T12:52:44  <janzert> s/skill number/mu above
2011-06-09T12:54:11  <jmcarthur> i unfortunately don't have the time to check up on it right now, but it just seems to me that since new opponents have high sigma anyway then raising everybody else's sigma too is just redundant
2011-06-09T12:55:41  <janzert> slightly yes, we could set the initial sigma higher and probably make it work out
2011-06-09T12:55:54  <janzert> this seems more straightforward and logical to me
2011-06-09T12:56:16  <jmcarthur> not to me, but i'm just an onlooker at this point
2011-06-09T12:56:25  <janzert> one problem that I don't like currently is ghosts never go away and don't have sigma increases
2011-06-09T12:56:49  <janzert> something there needs to change
2011-06-09T12:57:12  <jmcarthur> well they certainly need to go away after a while
2011-06-09T12:57:26  <McLeopold> the ghosts are helping us determine if trueskill is working like we want
2011-06-09T12:57:28  <janzert> right now they only go away if a later submission passes them in rank
2011-06-09T12:57:52  <jmcarthur> the lack of sigma increase wouldn't be a problem if everybody else didn't have redundant (IMO) sigma increases
2011-06-09T12:58:23  <McLeopold> the fact that ghosts retain a high rank inforces the need for increasing sigma for each submission
2011-06-09T12:58:59  <jmcarthur> hypothetical attack: i submit my bot repeatedly in order to increase everybody's sigma and destabilize the skills
2011-06-09T12:59:17  <McLeopold> perhaps the amount of sigma increase is too high?  I just guessed at a number, 0.1 for each new submission
2011-06-09T12:59:51  <janzert> I really think ghosts should disappear after the new submission reaches a stable rating (say the sigma crosses some threshold value)
2011-06-09T12:59:58  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: we can reduce the count of new submissions to unique user_ids?
2011-06-09T13:00:11  <jmcarthur> IMO, if there is to be any sigma added for each new opponent then it should be a very very small amount
2011-06-09T13:00:32  <janzert> McLeopold: did you see my message about the JSKills crash?
2011-06-09T13:00:33  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, that is the idea at some point, after we find the correct sigma cutoff value
2011-06-09T13:00:35  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: so basically never count resubmissions?
2011-06-09T13:00:45  <jmcarthur> sounds like that would defeat the purpose
2011-06-09T13:01:08  <McLeopold> janzert: yes on jskills
2011-06-09T13:01:18  <McLeopold> I don't know why it would do that.
2011-06-09T13:01:29  <jmcarthur> another thing i really don't like about this is that a bot's sigma will be adjusted pretty heavily even if they never actually play against the newly submitted bots
2011-06-09T13:01:49  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: we need some way of reducing mu for old submissions if new ones are constantly better
2011-06-09T13:02:05  <jmcarthur> g2g
2011-06-09T13:02:12  <jmcarthur> i will argue later maybe :)
2011-06-09T13:02:26  <McLeopold> good :)
2011-06-09T13:04:20  <janzert> also so you know the current secure sandbox is fast but slightly broken (in such a way that it breaks compiler.py) :/
2011-06-09T13:04:23  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@64.1.211.248.ptr.us.xo.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-09T13:05:35  <janzert> the good news is that once/if I can fix it, it is just as fast and non-secure running
2011-06-09T13:05:43  <McLeopold> what's the issue?
2011-06-09T13:06:14  <janzert> the jailguard doesn't exit when the child process does until it receives another line of input
2011-06-09T13:06:33  <janzert> basically I need to change how it reads stdin
2011-06-09T13:06:46  <McLeopold> oh
2011-06-09T13:07:10  <McLeopold> zaphus has a lot of good suggestions, I wonder if he'd be willing to do some php?
2011-06-09T13:07:15  <janzert> I'm not sure if moving it into its own thread will be enough or if I need to go to a nonblocking read
2011-06-09T13:07:31  <janzert> either way I just need some more time to work on it
2011-06-09T13:08:02  <janzert> that'd be great
2011-06-09T13:08:36  <janzert> so did you start that PySkills implementation yet? :P
2011-06-09T13:09:03  <janzert> I'm getting frustrated with the lack of a good stable trueskill implementation :(

2011-06-09T15:01:19  <UncleVasya> rabidus: You can do nothing.
2011-06-09T15:01:25  <UncleVasya> It's a server issue
2011-06-09T15:01:49  <rabidus> ok. too bad :<
2011-06-09T15:01:59  <rabidus> does it help that i reupload?

2011-06-09T15:02:37  <rabidus> not the same code tho
2011-06-09T15:02:55  <rabidus> but nothing big has changed
2011-06-09T15:03:01  <UncleVasya> hmm, you are writing in C++...
2011-06-09T15:03:05  <rabidus> yes
2011-06-09T15:03:40  <UncleVasya> I don't know what is wrong in this case. So I can not say  re-uploading will not work.
2011-06-09T15:03:57  <rabidus> yeah well i tried, same thing happened..
2011-06-09T15:04:06  <rabidus> i think i have to just test this locally
2011-06-09T15:04:10  <rabidus> thx anyway for help
2011-06-09T15:04:41  <UncleVasya> Maybe you have an old starter pack.

2011-06-09T15:06:02  <UncleVasya> For examlpe, my own bot (written in Ocaml) was playing well for a week or so but became crashing yesterday because server's input format has been changed.
2011-06-09T15:06:09  <berak> rabidus, compiled, but failed test cases
2011-06-09T15:06:37  <rabidus> what are those test cases
2011-06-09T15:07:30  <UncleVasya> chek you do enough cheks before proceed issue orders.
2011-06-09T15:08:01  <UncleVasya> Test cases are check your bot does not try to send ants to the water
2011-06-09T15:08:15  <rabidus> hmmh.. well, i don't do much that. ok, i might send them to the water.
2011-06-09T15:08:21  <rabidus> ok, thx.
2011-06-09T15:08:22  <UncleVasya> and things like that
2011-06-09T15:09:53  <UncleVasya> Or to the cell with another ant or (maybe) two or more ants into the same cell.
2011-06-09T15:10:43  <UncleVasya> Or to the cell with food.

2011-06-09T20:17:05  <mcstar> so locally my bot doesnt crash
2011-06-09T20:17:19  <antimatroid> no idea then sorry
2011-06-09T20:17:20  <mcstar> can that be a problem that it makes blocked moves?
2011-06-09T20:17:30  <antimatroid> you'll need to talk to mcleopold/janzert probably
2011-06-09T20:17:58  <mcstar> i just wanted my little critter to play through the nite while i sleep
2011-06-09T20:18:10  <mcstar> hell
2011-06-09T20:21:08  <mcstar> it seems it eats up hunterbot
2011-06-09T20:21:14  <mcstar> thats a good sign
2011-06-09T20:26:52  <mcstar> runs fine against test_bot.sh
2011-06-09T20:31:35  <mcstar> ok
2011-06-09T20:31:38  <mcstar> i think i got it
2011-06-09T20:32:10  <mcstar> in the meantime, seed was removed and theres player_seed now
2011-06-09T20:32:38  <mcstar> but my bot throws an error if it sees an unknown parameter
2011-06-09T20:36:23  <mcstar> Frontier: cant you make a cookie to make this setting permanent?
2011-06-09T20:36:25  <mcstar> A script from "file://" is requesting enhanced abilities that are UNSAFE and could be used to compromise your machine or data:
2011-06-09T20:37:37  <mcstar> firefox always ask this, and its getting annoying
2011-06-09T20:37:42  <mcstar> asks
2011-06-09T20:37:51  <Frontier> mcstar: This is not a setting I can simply store in a cookie I think.
2011-06-09T20:37:59  <mcstar> ok
2011-06-09T20:38:06  <mcstar> does chromium asks this>
2011-06-09T20:38:08  <mcstar> ?
2011-06-09T20:38:09  <Frontier> Is there no check box like 'always allow' ?
2011-06-09T20:38:16  <mcstar> but its not permanent
2011-06-09T20:38:49  <mcstar> well thx for the attention, bot runs a-okay

2011-06-09T21:09:29  <Pyronaut> Sorry to burst in and start asking questions immediately, but for ants, is there a C# starter package already done? On the staging server (triangle) it is linked to a non-existant file. Not sure if that is because it is not completed yet, or the html link is just wrong.
