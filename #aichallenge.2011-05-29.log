2011-05-29T00:23:02  <Frontier> So here is the offending ant the replay amstan posted: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=5009&debug=true&row=49&col=1&turn=69&config={%22label%22:2}
2011-05-29T00:23:23  <Frontier> It is not the bot that timed out this time.
2011-05-29T00:26:32  <Frontier> The replay seems to have some data for a turn 69 that isn't actually played. Only my bot that times out seems to run longer than the others.
2011-05-29T00:28:08  <Frontier> ah no, the cyan marker is also at "end - 1".
2011-05-29T00:39:57  <Frontier> Since the game went for 68 turns and the particular ant (0) survived. It should have a command length of 69 instead of 68. And the whole game should be one turn shorter.

2011-05-29T02:10:51  <McLeopold> Hi Frontier
2011-05-29T02:11:22  <McLeopold> Any clues on the incorrect game replays?
2011-05-29T02:11:55  <Frontier> Yes, what I wrote above. It happens when the current game ends by the last opponent crashing/timing out
2011-05-29T02:12:36  <Frontier> somehow the turn count gets messed up then
2011-05-29T02:15:07  <Frontier> Let's say we have two players in a game, and player 1 crashes right away in the first turn. What would the resulting replay look like? is there 1 turn or 0 turns?
2011-05-29T02:15:50  <Frontier> because you can argue that the game was decided /before/ one turn was played

2011-05-29T02:28:47  <McLeopold> yeah, I saw that a functional test with an ErrorBot would cause the visualizer to error out
2011-05-29T02:29:35  <McLeopold> Frontier: I would say the game would be 1 turn.  The crashed bots "moves" where all holds.
2011-05-29T02:31:00  <Frontier> ok, and the score array for player 1 has one entry, and for player 2 it has two entries
2011-05-29T02:32:28  <McLeopold> Both would have 2
2011-05-29T02:32:49  <McLeopold> [score after turn 1, bonus at end of game]
2011-05-29T02:33:40  <Frontier> but player one crashed right at the start, it didn't score anything
2011-05-29T02:33:54  <McLeopold> so it would have [0,0]
2011-05-29T02:34:19  <Frontier> in the visualizer you would see player one crash @ turn 1 and player 2 win @ turn 2 (end turn)
2011-05-29T02:34:22  <McLeopold> I guess it could have just one...
2011-05-29T02:35:06  <Frontier> if you give both players two score values then the visualizer would never show a crash at the first turn, which would seem right
2011-05-29T02:35:20  <McLeopold> so, if a player crashes at a turn, they don't get a score
2011-05-29T02:35:33  <McLeopold> so if you crash right away, you should have a blank score list
2011-05-29T02:35:36  <Frontier> yes, that would be good
2011-05-29T02:36:05  <McLeopold> what about the ant lines?  they do have an ant
2011-05-29T02:36:07  <Frontier> wait, would ther not be at least one element in the list?
2011-05-29T02:36:55  <Frontier> the score for each player at the start of the match? i.e. [1] if everyone has 1 starting ant
2011-05-29T02:37:14  <McLeopold> score is accumulated after each turn, so I would say no elements in list
2011-05-29T02:37:35  <Frontier> but I display something before turn 1
2011-05-29T02:37:45  <McLeopold> all zeros?
2011-05-29T02:38:00  <Frontier> right
2011-05-29T02:38:26  <McLeopold> so, we can put a starting score in, but that would mean the surviving player would have 3 elements in the list
2011-05-29T02:38:44  <Frontier> ??
2011-05-29T02:38:52  <McLeopold> [start, after turn 1, end bonus]
2011-05-29T02:39:33  <Frontier> currently there is no such thing as an additional end bonus in the replay files if i am not mistaken
2011-05-29T02:40:21  <Frontier> 'after turn 1' and 'end bonus' are simply added
2011-05-29T02:40:35  <McLeopold> They should be separated
2011-05-29T02:41:01  <McLeopold> but only surviving players would have the extra list element
2011-05-29T02:41:43  <McLeopold> the visualizer should also indicate how much bonus each surviving player got
2011-05-29T02:41:57  <Frontier> how much more can I pack in? :p
2011-05-29T02:42:18  <McLeopold> :)
2011-05-29T02:43:20  <Frontier> ok, how about an additional array property 'bonus' next to 'scores'
2011-05-29T02:43:40  <McLeopold> Now we need to be able to click on a spot on the map, and get the auto-zoom querystring copied to the clipboard. :p
2011-05-29T02:43:59  <McLeopold> I'm okay with a bonus property
2011-05-29T02:44:05  <Frontier> and after the last turn i display <running score> + <bonus> in the bar graph
2011-05-29T02:44:29  <McLeopold> with a slightly darker color for the bonus?
2011-05-29T02:45:02  <Frontier> McLeopold: We also need to lay waypoints and create automated playbacks with the camera following ants or moving to a row/col
2011-05-29T02:45:31  <Frontier> ...with a slightly darker color
2011-05-29T02:45:32  <McLeopold> and then show it in 3d?
2011-05-29T02:46:04  <Frontier> *sigh* yes, with WebGL and Opera 3D canvas. Using ShaderModel 3.0.
2011-05-29T02:46:14  <McLeopold> :P
2011-05-29T02:46:49  <Frontier> and a Java hack for IE
2011-05-29T02:47:27  <McLeopold> So this is minor, but can you make the text "Scores, #of ants, # of ants | turn" black, and make the rounded boxes grey?  So, reverse the coloring?
2011-05-29T02:48:09  <Frontier> hmm. would that look better?
2011-05-29T02:48:39  <McLeopold> I think it might.  You only want black to mean something.  Usually you want to fade dividing lines.
2011-05-29T02:49:26  <McLeopold> I'm a fan of not using true black on websites
2011-05-29T02:49:35  <McLeopold> So there is less contrast
2011-05-29T02:51:32  <Frontier> Now the text is black and looks like you can click on it.
2011-05-29T02:52:39  <McLeopold> link?
2011-05-29T02:53:23  <Frontier> http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer.php?game=8
2011-05-29T02:54:06  <Frontier> It is too heavy in my eyes. I'll keep the old color scheme there.
2011-05-29T02:55:11  <Frontier> btw the food bonus is going to crazy values on 5000 turn matches that end early.
2011-05-29T02:56:15  <Frontier> When two ants kill each other, do both players ger 1 score point?
2011-05-29T02:56:45  <McLeopold> a 1v1?  both would get 1 for the kill, and 1 for having an ant
2011-05-29T02:57:20  <McLeopold> yeah, the black text is too dark, but I would still lighten the border up
2011-05-29T02:58:35  <Frontier> 1 for having an ant? but that would only be on turn 1, right?

2011-05-29T06:28:39  <mcstar> have you implemented some kind of path minimization?
2011-05-29T06:35:42  <GreenTea> cool, works with python 2.7..
2011-05-29T06:43:21  <antimatroid1> mcstar: hello, yeah, i'm just heading into exam season
2011-05-29T06:43:26  <antimatroid1> classes ended friday
2011-05-29T06:43:40  <antimatroid1> path minimization for hwat?
2011-05-29T06:43:53  <antimatroid1> i did a fairly decent food collection algorithm a while ago
2011-05-29T06:43:58  <antimatroid1> it was far better than hunterbot
2011-05-29T06:44:27  <antimatroid1> it would collect all visible food, but also consider ants that I had already moved to collect food, if that makes sense? I expect a lot of people are doing that now?
2011-05-29T06:45:17  <antimatroid1> it's reasonably costly though, if you have lots of food it can take over 200ms
2011-05-29T06:45:44  <antimatroid1> but you are also probably planning too far ahead by then, as you collect the closest food first you can just do it for as long as you want each turn and just ignore the rest of the food
2011-05-29T06:46:33  <antimatroid1> i'm very curious about people's ideas for fighting though

2011-05-29T06:56:01  <mcstar> by path minimization i meant computing the shortest path between food cubes, obviously but since a food cube becomes an ant i guess this is not that important
2011-05-29T07:01:13  <antimatroid1> i don't get what you mean? between food cubes?
2011-05-29T07:02:41  <antimatroid1> i start with all squares containing an ant being available in 0 turns, then do a bfs from all food squares simultaneously until i've found the ant that can make it within the food radius of a food square, then update the availability values of the ants original location, it's target location and the food square location, then repeat that until all food is collected

2011-05-29T07:02:59  <antimatroid1> if you want, you can also pseudo collect food with their ants if you don't want to be going for some food that is closer to them

2011-05-29T07:05:34  <antimatroid1> GreenTea: i'm curious about your ideas if you're willing to share :P
2011-05-29T07:05:56  <antimatroid1> i would be surprised if your food collection isn't similar to above
2011-05-29T07:07:19  <antimatroid1> mcstar: i don't think i'm doing to manage much better than above, it's not optimal and there's a few little messy things you can tweak to your liking, but basically i expect the top bots to be collecting food like that
2011-05-29T07:07:33  <antimatroid1> which leaves the real contest being who can battle best and manage a good macro strategy
2011-05-29T07:08:43  <antimatroid1> my macro strategy will basically be along the lines of assigning a friend ant to every enemy ant and moving in their direction, spreading out and maximising visibility
2011-05-29T07:09:22  <antimatroid1> somebody with their username starting with k had a neat little spread out function, but they didn't publicise the example games that showed it
2011-05-29T07:09:47  <GreenTea> now i have no mature ideas) for now it is important to prepare environment..
2011-05-29T07:10:00  <antimatroid1> yeah, i've mostly done that
2011-05-29T07:10:17  <antimatroid1> i wrote the c++ bot a lot like an easy version of my normal bots, then made a separate "starter bot" for myself
2011-05-29T07:10:35  <antimatroid1> i'm not doing more programming for it till after exams though
2011-05-29T07:11:16  <mcstar> wel i think i will send the ant that seen the given food cube first, and then send it to eat it
2011-05-29T07:11:53  <antimatroid1> what's a food cube?
2011-05-29T07:12:01  <mcstar> food tile
2011-05-29T07:12:04  <antimatroid1> square?
2011-05-29T07:12:08  <mcstar> whatecer u want to cal it
2011-05-29T07:12:09  <antimatroid1> a cube is three dimensional :P
2011-05-29T07:12:12  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-29T07:12:24  <mcstar> obviously ants cant exist in 2 dimensions
2011-05-29T07:12:42  <mcstar> im imagining this in 2.5 dimensions
2011-05-29T07:12:43  <antimatroid1> i'm a mathematician, whatever i say is so in the given context :P
2011-05-29T07:12:53  <mcstar> 1 pixel in height
2011-05-29T07:13:17  <antimatroid1> half a dimension doesn't make any sense
2011-05-29T07:13:27  <mcstar> its a convention
2011-05-29T07:13:35  <antimatroid1> for what?
2011-05-29T07:13:45  <mcstar> u havent heard of 2.5D games?
2011-05-29T07:13:45  <antimatroid1> physicists annoy me to buggery with the way they do maths :P
2011-05-29T07:13:49  <antimatroid1> no?
2011-05-29T07:13:58  <antimatroid1> is that a 2d game with a 3d visualiser?
2011-05-29T07:14:22  <mcstar> u have a 2d map, but u look at it sort of from an angle, and object can shadow one another
2011-05-29T07:14:27  <mcstar> old strategy games....
2011-05-29T07:14:27  <antimatroid1> especially their index gymnastics and insistence to call what should be called a tensor field tensors :P
2011-05-29T07:14:58  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-29T07:15:07  <antimatroid1> you know what a vector field is yeah?
2011-05-29T07:15:09  <antimatroid1> and a vector?
2011-05-29T07:15:11  <sigh> antimatroid1: fraction dimensions are perfectly valid
2011-05-29T07:15:11  <mcstar> no i dont
2011-05-29T07:15:13  <mcstar> lol
2011-05-29T07:15:18  <antimatroid1> sigh: how?
2011-05-29T07:15:26  <sigh> although 2.5D in games is something else entirly
2011-05-29T07:15:27  <antimatroid1> mcstar: oh sorry, ignore me then :)
2011-05-29T07:15:33  <sigh> antimatroid1: every heard of fractals :P
2011-05-29T07:15:42  <antimatroid1> yes, although i've never studied them
2011-05-29T07:15:49  <mcstar> antimatroid1, im kidding of course i know what that is
2011-05-29T07:15:50  <antimatroid1> but keep going...
2011-05-29T07:16:11  <antimatroid1> mcstar: well physicst call tensors what are pretty much n-dimensional vector fields
2011-05-29T07:16:21  <antimatroid1> so in my opinion, logically they should be called tensor fields
2011-05-29T07:16:41  <sigh> fractals are called as such because they have fractional dimentionality
2011-05-29T07:16:43  <antimatroid1> and mathematicians use of tensor should be standard, a multilinear map, ie. f:R^n->R
2011-05-29T07:17:03  <sigh> here's a good starting point: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension
2011-05-29T07:17:11  <mcstar> antimatroid1, a tensor becomes a tensor field when it makes sense for it to be defined pointwise
2011-05-29T07:18:14  <antimatroid1> mcstar: hmmm okay, i admittedly know very little about the tensors physicists use
2011-05-29T07:18:18  <mcstar> and physicists have another kind of dimension lol, like a real dimension but we can even write power-series in the dimension
2011-05-29T07:18:41  <mcstar> as in the value of the dimension
2011-05-29T07:18:56  <antimatroid1> it just annoys me to no end when they try to tell people online that not just any n-dimensional cube of numbers say isn't a tensor because it doesn't necessarily adhere to some coordinate transformation laws, but that's all bs
2011-05-29T07:19:50  <mcstar> but its true
2011-05-29T07:20:10  <mcstar> a matrix isnt a collection of nxn numbers
2011-05-29T07:20:21  <mcstar> its a representation of a matrix
2011-05-29T07:20:33  <antimatroid1> sigh: hmmm okay :P
2011-05-29T07:20:49  <antimatroid1> i can't be bothered reading through all that though :P
2011-05-29T07:21:02  <antimatroid1> yeah, that gets iffy
2011-05-29T07:21:17  <mcstar> antimatroid1, you must have heard hausdorff dimensions
2011-05-29T07:21:17  <antimatroid1> i used to call an mxn table of say chars as a matrix, but it's not really
2011-05-29T07:21:21  <sigh> antimatroid1: the intro is enough to get an idea :P
2011-05-29T07:21:23  <antimatroid1> nope?
2011-05-29T07:21:43  *** sir_macelon <sir_macelon!~sir_macel@78.8.136.33> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-29T07:22:00  <mcstar> actually there are several definitions of fractal dimensions
2011-05-29T07:22:16  <sigh> yeah, the one I linked seems to be the most common, though
2011-05-29T07:22:39  <mcstar> it might be ahrd to compute
2011-05-29T07:22:43  <antimatroid1> there is way too much maths, it's both nice and bad
2011-05-29T07:23:12  <sigh> there was an easier one which only required you to understand what logs were
2011-05-29T07:23:15  <sigh> I'll try find it
2011-05-29T07:23:19  <mcstar> antimatroid1, so do you know now what i meant by 2.5D?
2011-05-29T07:23:58  <antimatroid1> yeah sort of
2011-05-29T07:24:18  <antimatroid1> an interesting example i can think of was that icpc ai contest earlier in the year
2011-05-29T07:24:33  <antimatroid1> it could be represented in 2d, but really it was 3d sort of
2011-05-29T07:24:39  <antimatroid1> there was even a 3d visualiser for it
2011-05-29T07:24:54  <antimatroid1> http://queue.acm.org/icpc/
2011-05-29T07:24:59  <mcstar> type it in google 2.5d game
2011-05-29T07:25:07  <mcstar> first pic is what i meant
2011-05-29T07:25:21  <sigh> antimatroid1: this page seems to be a good introduction to fractional dimensions, less math the wiki :P http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/cogsci/chaos/workshop/Fractals.html
2011-05-29T07:25:43  <UncleVasya> I quess first pic will be a Diablo screnshot :)
2011-05-29T07:25:44  <antimatroid1> mcstar: yeah okay, like pokemon?
2011-05-29T07:25:53  <antimatroid1> that should be the obvious trivial example :P
2011-05-29T07:25:57  <mcstar> what is pokemon :D
2011-05-29T07:26:02  <sigh> haha
2011-05-29T07:26:10  <antimatroid1> no, it's "there are only 151 pokemon"
2011-05-29T07:26:19  <antimatroid1> i refuse to hear otherwise
2011-05-29T07:26:30  <sigh> no love for missingno? :P
2011-05-29T07:27:18  <antimatroid1> no idea what that is :P
2011-05-29T07:27:36  <antimatroid1> oh, yes i do
2011-05-29T07:27:53  <antimatroid1> i think, i forgot about tht
2011-05-29T07:27:56  <sigh> I was about to ask if you actual played the originals :P
2011-05-29T07:27:58  <antimatroid1> and mew was 152 yeah?
2011-05-29T07:28:07  <sigh> new was 151
2011-05-29T07:28:12  <sigh> *mew
2011-05-29T07:28:14  <antimatroid1> i only ever played red
2011-05-29T07:28:26  <antimatroid1> so mewtwo was 150?
2011-05-29T07:28:30  <sigh> yes
2011-05-29T07:28:33  <antimatroid1> ah okay
2011-05-29T07:28:46  <antimatroid1> okay, there are 152 pokemon
2011-05-29T07:28:54  <sigh> haha
2011-05-29T07:29:00  <mcstar> sigh, its easy to calculate hausdorff with recursive patterns, but what do u do with something like julai/mandelbrot?
2011-05-29T07:29:18  <antimatroid1> ask euler
2011-05-29T07:29:33  <mcstar> euler know shit bout fractals
2011-05-29T07:29:50  <antimatroid1> http://benisawesome.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/457x457-missingno-has-anyone-really.jpg errr what?
2011-05-29T07:29:59  <sigh> mcstar, dunno... I don't know much about this stuff other than the basics
2011-05-29T07:30:19  <antimatroid1> does that make sense?
2011-05-29T07:30:34  <mcstar> yes no right soon
2011-05-29T07:31:09  <sigh> "The Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set equals 2 as determined by a result of Mitsuhiro Shishikura." from wikipedia
2011-05-29T07:31:34  <mcstar> lol
2011-05-29T07:31:41  <mcstar> i guess its not easy then
2011-05-29T07:31:44  <sigh> references Mitsuhiro Shishikura, The Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets, Ann. of Math. 147 (1998) p. 225-267.
2011-05-29T07:31:54  <sigh> so I guess that's a good place to look :)
2011-05-29T07:32:00  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-29T07:32:11  <sigh> http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DS/9201282
2011-05-29T07:32:54  <sigh> I meant to paste the link before, copied the wrong bit of text :P
2011-05-29T07:33:19  <sir_macelon> hi, how can i check why my bot crashed on the beta server? i see only replay is available and no err logs
2011-05-29T07:33:38  <mcstar> i found it
2011-05-29T07:33:58  <GreenTea> map "world" =))
2011-05-29T07:34:23  <mcstar> sir_macelon, you should ask sir mcleopold
2011-05-29T07:35:43  <mcstar> i guess who understands fractals really understands calculus
2011-05-29T07:35:46  <sir_macelon> seems he;s not around, anyone else?
2011-05-29T07:36:08  <antimatroid1> sir_macelon: try running your bot locally with the test thing
2011-05-29T07:36:32  <antimatroid1> i think you want to use your bot in test_bot.sh
2011-05-29T07:36:40  <antimatroid1> something like "./playgame.py --food none -o viewer -t 30 -v -m submission_test/test.map "python dist/sample_bots/python/LeftyBot.py" "python submission_test/TestBot.py""
2011-05-29T07:36:59  <sir_macelon> i already did that many times and it never crashed
2011-05-29T07:37:06  <antimatroid1> hmm, not sure then sorry
2011-05-29T07:37:30  <sir_macelon> and on this beta server sometimes it crashes and i don't know why
2011-05-29T07:37:51  <antimatroid1> is it timing out maybe?
2011-05-29T07:38:12  <sir_macelon> no, the status is crashed and it is always on first turn
2011-05-29T07:39:21  <antimatroid1> hmmm no idea sorry :)
2011-05-29T07:39:25  <sir_macelon> for me it is some problem with the running script on the server
2011-05-29T07:39:39  <sir_macelon> can anyone check that?
2011-05-29T07:43:10  <mcstar> sigh, that article is very complicated
2011-05-29T07:43:28  <sigh> mcstar: I can't help you there, it's well over my head :)
2011-05-29T07:43:34  <mcstar> maybe when brain augmentation becomes possible i will try to understand it
2011-05-29T07:43:58  <sir_macelon> for example in game 5400 i would like to check what happaned
2011-05-29T07:44:40  <mcstar> sir_macelon, there was a similar problem in the last couple of days discussed here, maybe u should check irc logs
2011-05-29T07:46:03  <sigh> or you can message McLeopold
2011-05-29T07:46:24  <mcstar> hell i cant stand this, my fan annoys me, speedfan cant control my fanspeed
2011-05-29T07:49:01  <sir_macelon> mcstar: thanks, i'll check that
2011-05-29T08:01:38  <antimatroid1> ffffffffff

2011-05-29T09:24:47  <antimatroid1> if that helps
2011-05-29T09:24:53  <antimatroid1> otherwise you probably know more than i

2011-05-29T09:25:02  <mcstar> you guys play go?
2011-05-29T09:25:07  <mcstar> i want to learn too
2011-05-29T09:25:09  <antimatroid1> not i
2011-05-29T09:25:15  <mcstar> i see
2011-05-29T09:25:16  <smiley1983> I haven't played in a while, but I have a bit
2011-05-29T09:25:25  <janzert> mostly just track the state of computer go myself
2011-05-29T09:25:34  <sigh> I used to play go a lot...
2011-05-29T09:25:47  <antimatroid1> sigh is the resident go specialist
2011-05-29T09:25:49  <sigh> now I just keep track of interesting events :P
2011-05-29T09:25:52  <antimatroid1> at least atm :P
2011-05-29T09:25:55  <mcstar> i read they gice computers high handicaps
2011-05-29T09:25:59  <mcstar> give
2011-05-29T09:26:30  <mcstar> how many moves is that today?
2011-05-29T09:26:43  <smiley1983> this bot would still probably lose to relatively weak professional players (just judging by its rank)
2011-05-29T09:27:24  <smiley1983> I mean with handicap
2011-05-29T09:27:31  <smiley1983> up to 9 stones is normal
2011-05-29T09:27:57  <mcstar> at least a game computers suck in
2011-05-29T09:28:33  <mcstar> sigh: did you learn to play against bots or humans?
2011-05-29T09:28:36  <smiley1983> they're getting better though: this one would slaughter me, and it doesn't play like a monte carlo bot
2011-05-29T09:28:45  <sigh> mcstar: humans
2011-05-29T09:29:05  <sigh> when I started playing bots were only about 10k, so it only took about half a year for me to beat them
2011-05-29T09:29:12  <mcstar> maybe ill get my friends to play this instead of fps
2011-05-29T09:29:29  <mcstar> i see
2011-05-29T09:29:40  <janzert> mcstar: good luck ;)
2011-05-29T09:29:58  <mcstar> im gonna need it :)
2011-05-29T09:30:24  <sigh> the bots now are at a respectable rank... I wouldn't call you a weak player if you were 5d :)
2011-05-29T09:30:35  <sigh> but yeah, they will still lose easily to a professional
2011-05-29T09:30:53  <smiley1983> I see you do not play for rank :)
2011-05-29T09:31:03  <sigh> me?
2011-05-29T09:31:05  <smiley1983> I'm guessing that means you're better than me
2011-05-29T09:31:13  <smiley1983> Assuming it's the same KGS username
2011-05-29T09:31:27  <sigh> yeah... I'm logged in as pulsar though
2011-05-29T09:31:49  <sigh> sigh is an admin account, and I haven't done any admin stuff for a while and hate users messing me :P
2011-05-29T09:32:00  <smiley1983> Right, that makes sense
2011-05-29T09:32:41  <smiley1983> my account there is jedwardh, but hasn't been used in a while
2011-05-29T09:33:18  <sigh> still got more recent games than me :P
2011-05-29T09:33:39  <smiley1983> seeing the mention of the bot made me want to play again

2011-05-29T09:35:37  <smiley1983> ha, yes, and will get harder as they get closer to professional standard and people throw more processing power at them

2011-05-29T09:37:33  <UncleVasya> I have found some student executed in writing his bot for Planet Wars as his course-ending project.
2011-05-29T09:38:07  <sigh> executed?
2011-05-29T09:38:10  <smiley1983> I'm not sure I understand...

2011-05-29T09:39:07  <janzert> hope he got a good grade out of it :)
2011-05-29T09:39:17  <UncleVasya> I'll try to find better words or expalin it.
2011-05-29T09:39:21  <sigh> :)
2011-05-29T09:41:27  <UncleVasya> When you're doing a studying project, you're going to give to your teacher not only a program but also many A4 letters. What is properly word for it?
2011-05-29T09:41:47  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: are you saying that someone's execution (as in death penalty) was arranged, or are you just saying that he wrote such a bot for a final project?

2011-05-29T09:42:23  <janzert> thesis, possibly?
2011-05-29T09:42:35  <mcstar> no, thesis is a bigger thing
2011-05-29T09:42:40  <mcstar> right?
2011-05-29T09:43:07  <janzert> yes, but could fit what UncleVasya means possibly
2011-05-29T09:43:18  <mcstar> UncleVasya: means a semester ending assignment
2011-05-29T09:43:39  <janzert> ahh, then thesis would not fit
2011-05-29T09:43:59  <mcstar> but ty UncleVasya u made me laugh
2011-05-29T09:44:07  <mcstar> no offfense
2011-05-29T09:44:36  <mcstar> i instantly imagined china

2011-05-29T09:55:30  <mcstar> lol i just noticed that on the lower part of my favourite glass cup, 42 is printed on it
2011-05-29T09:56:06  <mcstar> its not printed, its a relief actually
2011-05-29T10:01:56  <sir_macelon> what happened to the official ai-contest.com web page?
2011-05-29T10:02:28  <UncleVasya> mcstar, clean it up :)

2011-05-29T10:08:12  <hjax> is there a way to test my bot locally without having to specify 8 bots for play_game.py?
2011-05-29T10:08:47  <sigh> use a map which requires less players?
2011-05-29T10:09:44  <hjax> which map requires less?
2011-05-29T10:10:43  <sigh> well the default one used by play_one_game.sh is a 4 player map
2011-05-29T10:10:51  <sigh> let me see if there's anythign less
2011-05-29T10:11:36  <hjax> when i didnt specify a map it told me to choose one :/
2011-05-29T10:13:02  <sigh> I'm talking about the play_one_game.sh script which shows you how to run an example game
2011-05-29T10:13:12  <sigh> the map that it uses is maps/symmetric_maps/symmetric_10.map which is a 4 player game
2011-05-29T10:13:35  <hjax> ah, but it wouldnt let me specify my own bot as it said that there was 5/4
2011-05-29T10:13:38  <sigh> antimatroid1: someone is asking about maps, this is your specialty :P
2011-05-29T10:14:11  <antimatroid1> you can adjust the min_players parameter in the map generators and generate 2 player maps
2011-05-29T10:14:12  <sigh> hjax, oh you'll need to actually edit the command it uses... it's only an example :)
2011-05-29T10:15:12  <hjax> sigh: lets see
2011-05-29T10:16:33  <sigh> antimatroid1: maybe you should generate some 2 player maps and commit them, some people might find them easier during development
2011-05-29T10:16:36  <antimatroid1> UncleVasya: did you have a question?
2011-05-29T10:16:43  <antimatroid1> sigh: they're shit for testing on
2011-05-29T10:16:49  <sigh> ok :)
2011-05-29T10:16:49  <antimatroid1> i'd rather people had to do it themselves
2011-05-29T10:17:01  <antimatroid1> the scoring makes no real sense for 2 player games imo
2011-05-29T10:17:57  <antimatroid1> lol, what did happen to the contest website?
2011-05-29T10:18:04  <antimatroid1> jeff didn't let the domain expire did he?
2011-05-29T10:18:46  <UncleVasya> <antimatroid1> No, I haven't. Why do you think so?

2011-05-29T10:41:31  <aeter> Hi, I know it can be a stupid question - I have created a coffeescript started package, and I'd like to test it - how can I?
2011-05-29T10:41:59  <smiley1983> have you downloaded the repository from github?
2011-05-29T10:42:11  <aeter> nope, not yet
2011-05-29T10:42:15  <hjax> heres all it contains:   turn    1 bot 0 timed out
2011-05-29T10:42:24  <smiley1983> that's the first step
2011-05-29T10:42:39  <aeter> ok, thanks - I'll clone it then
2011-05-29T10:42:57  <smiley1983> hjax: and your bot is supposed to be outputting to stderr?
2011-05-29T10:44:07  <smiley1983> aeter: once you have the repo, go to aichallenge/ants, and run play_one_game.sh
2011-05-29T10:44:11  <smiley1983> or .cmd if Windows
2011-05-29T10:44:26  <aeter> smiley1983: awesome, thanks!
2011-05-29T10:44:27  <hjax> i told it to output to stderr right before it starts its first move, which never makes it to the log
2011-05-29T10:44:45  <smiley1983> if that works, try test_bot.sh "command to run/MyBot.ext"
2011-05-29T10:45:18  <smiley1983> okay, try running your bot directly from the command line, then type "ready" into it
2011-05-29T10:46:40  <aeter> it actually runs quite ok against the "cat test.txt | coffee mybot.coffee", test.txt being the bot I/O in the wiki - but I'm starting the tests. Thanks!

2011-05-29T10:58:28  <aeter> a maybe stupid question, is the map round - that is, crossing the top makes ants appear at the bottom of map?

2011-05-29T11:23:14  <smiley1983> okay, so that'll be why the comparison wasn't going the way your expected
2011-05-29T11:23:41  <smiley1983> s/your/you
2011-05-29T11:24:19  <hjax> wait a second :/ i added more trackers, an if loop is acting weird
2011-05-29T11:26:53  <hjax> it works right for the first ant, and updates the "bestscore" to the first ants distance to the food
2011-05-29T11:27:57  <hjax> but the second ant isnt as close, and when it fails the if loop, it *should* move on to the next ant
2011-05-29T11:37:18  <hjax> also most it working :D
2011-05-29T11:37:42  <hjax> almost got it working (dont you love spell check?)

2011-05-29T11:43:50  <aeter> I'm sorry, the starter package I'm preparing is almost always crashing or receiving a timeout. Is there a way to see what error message makes it crashing?
2011-05-29T11:44:06  <aeter> what does a timeout mean?

2011-05-29T11:48:01  <smiley1983> aeter: add -E to the playgame.py args and the errors should appear in game_logs/0.bot?.error
2011-05-29T11:48:09  <aeter> awesome! thanks
2011-05-29T11:52:36  <aeter> wow, now it even seems to work with play_one_game.sh
2011-05-29T11:52:46  <aeter> How can I make a submit request for a new language?
2011-05-29T11:57:18  <aeter> btw the code is at https://github.com/aeter/google-ai-2011
2011-05-29T11:58:28  <smiley1983> standard method is to fork the repo, clone your fork, commit your changes, push your changes, then submit a pull request
2011-05-29T11:58:50  <smiley1983> I've done all that so I can probably help if you get stuck, though I won't be here much longer
2011-05-29T11:59:15  <aeter> thanks - I'll try to do it as fast as I;m able to
2011-05-29T11:59:22  <aeter> btw, the code may be full of bugs...
2011-05-29T11:59:27  <aeter> :)
2011-05-29T11:59:40  <smiley1983> the github help pages are very good, though, that's mostly what I used
2011-05-29T12:00:38  <smiley1983> Based on my experience, I think it's worth pushing the changes and then sleeping on it before submitting a pull request - after just about every request, I thought of something the next morning which should be changed
2011-05-29T12:01:36  <aeter> thanks - I'm reading the docs - probably will send a pull request in about 24 hours then
2011-05-29T12:01:39  <aeter> Thanks very much!
2011-05-29T12:02:08  <smiley1983> no worries :)

2011-05-29T12:41:26  <smiley1983> they're not sending emails yet - there's a "click here" at the bottom of the page which tells you to expect an email

2011-05-29T12:45:14  <aeter> btw, is mybot.js OK, or should it be changed to MyBot.js?
2011-05-29T12:46:48  <smiley1983> ... compiler.py seems to be expecting MyBot.js
2011-05-29T12:48:04  <smiley1983> also, it will fail if the files are inside a directory (unless they've fixed that)
2011-05-29T12:48:41  <aeter> thanks
2011-05-29T12:50:01  <aeter> it says it will send e-mails if it failed to compile
2011-05-29T12:50:46  <smiley1983> I think that's also not true (yet)

2011-05-29T12:51:26  <aeter> found it -> compiled but failed test cases
2011-05-29T12:51:39  <aeter> it needs more playing with :)
2011-05-29T12:52:23  <smiley1983> I think that might be the error people were getting when the files were zipped inside a dir
2011-05-29T12:55:04  <aeter> it seems to try to move to a blocked squares
2011-05-29T12:55:10  <aeter> will this fail the test cases?
2011-05-29T12:55:24  <aeter> turn    1 bot 0 ignored actions: o 1 18 e # move blocked o 3 18 n # move blocked
2011-05-29T12:55:49  <aeter> My package doesn't (yet) try to avoid moving to water
2011-05-29T12:56:03  <aeter> or - it does actually, but maybe it's buggy
2011-05-29T12:56:05  <aeter> :)
2011-05-29T12:57:17  <aeter> nice there were tests - I'll improve it and resubmit. thanks!
2011-05-29T13:07:21  <smiley1983> aeter: I believe the test cases are run with --strict, meaning valid moves are enforeced.
2011-05-29T13:07:53  <smiley1983> However, it must allow attempts to move onto food tiles, because the starter bot logic requires this behaviour
2011-05-29T13:08:33  <aeter> There was an error with the logic of my package; I'm tyring to move squares which are not ants
2011-05-29T13:08:50  <aeter> :) which may not be possible
2011-05-29T13:10:32  <smiley1983> yes, I imagine that would fail the test case :)

2011-05-29T15:00:52  <bhasker> its able to go across a 1 square wide corridor not bad without getting blocked
2011-05-29T15:01:06  <bhasker> some did get blocked but it still somehow made it across
2011-05-29T15:01:34  <bhasker> i still need to improve the bots tactics, the broad strategy is decent
2011-05-29T15:01:37  <mcstar> ive seen this map somewhere....
2011-05-29T15:01:37  <Frontier> I tried to kick off some mapping hype. Maybe when people see my world map they start creating maps on their own that are more recognizable than randomly generated ones
2011-05-29T15:01:39  <bhasker> but its very poor tectically

2011-05-29T18:58:59  <hjax> hey Frontier :)
2011-05-29T18:59:23  <amstan> hjax: too busy playing minecraft, lol
2011-05-29T18:59:34  <Frontier> hi, I see your bot has improved, but it times out often
2011-05-29T18:59:51  <hjax> amstan, fun game :)
2011-05-29T19:00:06  <Frontier> amstan: no, I just watch mincraft videos. have you seen the cute dogs?
2011-05-29T19:00:13  <amstan> yes, they're annoying
2011-05-29T19:00:16  <amstan> i kill them regularly
2011-05-29T19:00:23  <hjax> Frontier, i know :/ im not sure if its because my code is too slow or something else random
2011-05-29T19:00:29  <Frontier> hehe, they can hunt pigs for you
2011-05-29T19:01:11  <Frontier> hjax, deep are your loops nested?
2011-05-29T19:01:39  <hjax> for every food i loop through all my ants, which can be time consuming
2011-05-29T19:03:28  <Frontier> I know, my code is slow because of that as well
2011-05-29T19:04:31  <hjax> would that be whats casuing my timeout?
2011-05-29T19:05:01  <hjax> causing*
2011-05-29T19:07:52  <hjax> btw i love how the site returned the error message if your bot fails to enter contest now :D
2011-05-29T19:10:04  <bhasker> why would you iterate over every food
2011-05-29T19:10:09  <bhasker> iterate over every ant
2011-05-29T19:10:21  <Frontier> but i want to eat all the food, not just one
2011-05-29T19:10:49  <hjax> i know i did it backwards, but i wanted to see the results
2011-05-29T19:10:53  <bhasker> well you can't eat all the food
2011-05-29T19:10:58  <bhasker> if you don't have enough ants?
2011-05-29T19:11:06  <bhasker> so at start iterating over food is pointless?
2011-05-29T19:11:22  <bhasker> when ants > food maybe the other way makes sense
2011-05-29T19:11:22  <Frontier> but i need to know which food is closest to my start ant
2011-05-29T19:11:33  <bhasker> you can do that with a bfs search from the ant
2011-05-29T19:12:09  <bhasker> it will give you the shortest path to the closest food as well
2011-05-29T19:12:10  <Frontier> Oo So you actually walk all the squares around your ant until you find something edible?
2011-05-29T19:12:17  <bhasker> pretty much
2011-05-29T19:12:23  <bhasker> within a certain radius
2011-05-29T19:12:31  <bhasker> you can solve it for all ants/food at the same time
2011-05-29T19:12:38  <bhasker> a1kon has a way to do that too
2011-05-29T19:12:42  <hjax> it is more effective to find the closest food to an ant than vice-versa
2011-05-29T19:14:11  <bhasker> i just do it within the view radius ofthe ant
2011-05-29T19:14:16  <bhasker> so that i don't go exploring the whole map
2011-05-29T19:14:22  <hjax> one favors ant population growth, the other favors area of influence
2011-05-29T19:14:22  <bhasker> so each ant just looks for food close to it
2011-05-29T19:14:37  <bhasker> cause routing to a food 10 miles away is kinda pointless anyway
2011-05-29T19:15:00  <bhasker> by the time you get to the food it might be gone
2011-05-29T19:15:08  <bhasker> my bot's logic is pretty simple
2011-05-29T19:15:37  <bhasker> its like per ant ( find closest food () route to food, if no food ( find closest enemy ant() route to ant ()) if neither move to the front
2011-05-29T19:15:57  <bhasker> where front is all the squares which have unseen squares next to them as well as squares with dead ants and enemy ants
2011-05-29T19:16:08  <bhasker> so it will randomly route to a frontline squares
2011-05-29T19:17:04  <hjax> thats the basic strategy :)
2011-05-29T19:17:04  <bhasker> i added some rudiementary logic to a) not suicide b) form adhoc squads out of close by ants and route them as a single unit c) battle resolution to avoid dumb moves ( but it doesn't work very well)
2011-05-29T19:17:29  <hjax> i want to try flanking enemy lines
2011-05-29T19:17:46  <bhasker> so i make some moves, do battle resolution, if it looks like i lose more than enemy then i don't make that move
2011-05-29T19:17:59  <bhasker> right now it doesn't do smarter things ike retreat if in a losing situation etc
2011-05-29T19:18:40  <hjax> what about flooding one point of the enemies line? do a "Picket's charge"
2011-05-29T19:19:40  <hjax> but you are still looping through all the foods and ants, and your bot doesnt time out :/
2011-05-29T19:20:01  <bhasker> for that the bot has to build more awareness of maps spatial layout
2011-05-29T19:20:05  <bhasker> well my bot is in c++
2011-05-29T19:20:09  <bhasker> so that alone makes it much faster
2011-05-29T19:20:17  <bhasker> main reason why i wrote it in c++
2011-05-29T19:20:43  <bhasker> cause i had these issues when i wrote planetwars bot, speed was a major issue when coding in python
2011-05-29T19:21:09  <hjax> i agree :/
2011-05-29T19:21:26  <bhasker> also the fact that in python objets are slow as hell
2011-05-29T19:21:34  <bhasker> you need to keep using tuples to make it reasonably fast
2011-05-29T19:21:35  <hjax> but python is the only programming language that im even slightly good at :/
2011-05-29T19:21:46  <bhasker> and its annnoying as hell to code with indexes all over the place
2011-05-29T19:21:57  <bhasker> copying python objects is so sloooooow
2011-05-29T19:22:10  <bhasker> i had the issue when i wanted to copy state of the map and make/unmake moves
2011-05-29T19:22:32  <bhasker> it took too long to copy maps, then i had to rewrite my whole code without too much object based stuff
2011-05-29T19:22:37  <hjax> yay my bot did what is was supposed to do!
2011-05-29T19:22:38  <hjax> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=6232
2011-05-29T19:23:04  <bhasker> hjax your bot is not routing to closest food
2011-05-29T19:23:05  <bhasker> why is that
2011-05-29T19:23:26  <hjax> because of what we talked about before
2011-05-29T19:23:51  <hjax> i routes foods to the ants, so if a farther away food comes up before a closer one...
2011-05-29T19:23:57  <bhasker> ah
2011-05-29T19:24:07  <bhasker> also the other thing with this game is that initial growth is exponential
2011-05-29T19:24:11  <Frontier> hjax, you get 2 extra food items for holding south america -.-
2011-05-29T19:24:22  <bhasker> not grabbing food on time will slow the bot down too much

2011-05-29T19:25:50  <Frontier> like mine outgrows yours bhasker ^^
2011-05-29T19:25:58  <Frontier> until it times out of course
2011-05-29T19:26:17  <bhasker> yours outgrows mine because mine is too aggresive in fighting
2011-05-29T19:26:50  <bhasker> and it depends on the map
2011-05-29T19:26:55  <olexs1> is there a way to get crash messages from a server game? my bot crashes on the server and I can't reproduce it locally -.-
2011-05-29T19:26:56  <bhasker> i don't think on symmetric maps
2011-05-29T19:27:00  <bhasker> my bot will do worse than yours
2011-05-29T19:27:04  <bhasker> on growth intially
2011-05-29T19:27:09  <hjax> anyone else seeing an error message here? : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=6240
2011-05-29T19:27:10  <Frontier> load the replay like this: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=6240&debug=true  There is a bug in the replay generation when the last enemy times out or crashes
2011-05-29T19:27:27  <hjax> ah thanks :0
2011-05-29T19:28:06  <hjax> thats my bots fault, it timed out at the end :/
2011-05-29T19:28:44  <bhasker> also the food is not spawning symmetrically
2011-05-29T19:28:48  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=6210
2011-05-29T19:28:51  <bhasker> check this game
2011-05-29T19:28:57  <bhasker> your bot has food closer than mine
2011-05-29T19:29:01  <Frontier> i think that is an engine option possibly chosen at random
2011-05-29T19:29:03  <bhasker> thats what slows my bot down
2011-05-29T19:29:49  <Frontier> lol, it stands 80:10 and I still lose :p
2011-05-29T19:29:56  <hjax> Frontiers bot blows it on that one :/
2011-05-29T19:30:08  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=6244
2011-05-29T19:30:22  <bhasker> yup
2011-05-29T19:30:27  <bhasker> your bot is too defensive
2011-05-29T19:30:32  <bhasker> it just shuts down
2011-05-29T19:31:15  <bhasker> my bot controls over 80% of that map though
2011-05-29T19:31:21  <bhasker> and thats why its able to grow and recover
2011-05-29T19:31:34  <bhasker> more map control == more food == more ants
2011-05-29T19:31:47  <hjax> frontiers bot needs to stand back and maintain land it already owns
2011-05-29T19:31:55  <bhasker> it loses because of that
2011-05-29T19:32:00  <bhasker> cause once you start doing that
2011-05-29T19:32:05  <bhasker> you are not getting enough food to grown
2011-05-29T19:32:13  <bhasker> unless you control a large proportion of the land
2011-05-29T19:32:16  <bhasker> you will eventually lose
2011-05-29T19:32:23  <bhasker> unless you control > 50%
2011-05-29T19:33:17  <bhasker> this game wil be a lot of territory control as well
2011-05-29T19:33:36  <hjax> my bot keeps timing out :/
2011-05-29T19:33:44  <bhasker> write it in c++ :)
2011-05-29T19:33:54  <hjax> i dont know c++ ;/
2011-05-29T19:33:58  <bhasker> 2) restrict your bfs search
2011-05-29T19:34:00  <Frontier> you also need to keep space between your ants if food just spwans randomly on any free square
2011-05-29T19:34:02  <bhasker> to a view radius around the ant
2011-05-29T19:34:12  <bhasker> yes  that too frontier
2011-05-29T19:34:25  <bhasker> all the more reason to spread out
2011-05-29T19:34:33  <bhasker> that way the central area is used to spawn new food
2011-05-29T19:34:41  <bhasker> and your bots always have a closer path to the food than others
2011-05-29T19:34:46  <bhasker> if you spread circularly
2011-05-29T19:34:53  <bhasker> though are control gets harder
2011-05-29T19:34:59  <bhasker> as it increases quadratically
2011-05-29T19:35:29  <bhasker> i think the really good bots though will be the ones which have good tactics
2011-05-29T19:35:33  <bhasker> than just strategy
2011-05-29T19:35:46  <bhasker> being able to use formations to minimize losses would be key
2011-05-29T19:36:25  <bhasker> this bot ain't doing too bad for a week's worth of work on it
2011-05-29T19:36:58  <_flag> Anyone know what's the ETA until the contest starts?
2011-05-29T19:37:03  <Frontier> I don't want to use a bfs now, just because YOU do :p
2011-05-29T19:37:25  <bhasker> well bfs is the easiest way to find shortest path on an unweighted graph
2011-05-29T19:37:28  <_flag> If it makes you feel any better Frontier, I don't use bfs and my bot > bhaskers bot (hehe)

2011-05-29T19:37:45  <_flag> It's not on the server yet
2011-05-29T19:37:50  <_flag> That's a starter pack
2011-05-29T19:37:56  <bhasker> ah
2011-05-29T19:37:59  <bhasker> put it up
2011-05-29T19:38:10  <Frontier> so how do you know it is better than bhasker's?
2011-05-29T19:38:19  <_flag> "Please do not use to test your newest and most secret bot, since there might be security issues. Have fun testing."
2011-05-29T19:38:33  <bhasker> meh i am not putting more work on that code anyway
2011-05-29T19:38:36  <_flag> Although I suppose I should test it
2011-05-29T19:38:41  <bhasker> i will probably share this version of the code anyway
2011-05-29T19:39:16  <hjax> im taking out everything that can slow my bot down
2011-05-29T19:39:25  <Frontier> i *could* just download you submissions from the server, but I keep myself from doing that.
2011-05-29T19:39:50  <hjax> all the logging and maintaining lists for logging probably at least slows it down some
2011-05-29T19:40:25  <Frontier> we need a tcp server :)
2011-05-29T19:40:42  <hjax> anyone skilled enough to make one?
2011-05-29T19:41:23  <hjax> a tcp would make testing easier by so much
2011-05-29T19:42:26  <_flag> The problem with making a tcp server is the way all the previous ones were done was by re-implementing the engine, which is a lot of work
2011-05-29T19:45:22  <hjax> i think i just sped up my bot
2011-05-29T20:06:34  <bhasker> the number of bots on the server  are increasing
2011-05-29T20:08:31  <hjax> ive uploaded my code more times than any other person
2011-05-29T20:08:43  <hjax> yes, can we go back to 1000 turn games?
2011-05-29T20:12:00  <hjax> grr i want my new bot version to play a game :/, i think timeout is fixed and it should be smarter about gathering food
2011-05-29T20:23:36  <bhasker> 40 versions hjax
2011-05-29T20:24:22  <hjax> yes lol
2011-05-29T20:24:55  <hjax> hmmm i messed something up again, my bot runs in circles but collects no food
2011-05-29T20:25:04  <bhasker> :)
2011-05-29T20:25:08  <bhasker> try it locally first
2011-05-29T20:25:15  <bhasker> against an older version of your bot
2011-05-29T20:25:20  <bhasker> thats what i do
2011-05-29T20:25:23  <bhasker> before i upload
2011-05-29T20:25:33  <bhasker> that way you know its not doing anything stupid
2011-05-29T20:26:34  <hjax> it takes me a while to do that :/, plus do any maps support 2 plays?

2011-05-29T20:35:35  <bhasker> you can create your own maps
2011-05-29T20:35:41  <bhasker> just check out the code for the challenge
2011-05-29T20:35:45  <bhasker> it has the map generator
2011-05-29T20:35:57  <bhasker> or you can always hand code maps the way frontier did
2011-05-29T20:36:25  <Frontier> -.- i used an ascii art converter
2011-05-29T20:36:32  <hjax> did he make the one called world?
2011-05-29T20:36:55  * Frontier nods
2011-05-29T20:37:02  <hjax> awesome :F
2011-05-29T20:37:04  <hjax> :D
2011-05-29T20:37:30  <Frontier> The map generator is quite awesome, too.
2011-05-29T20:38:01  <hjax> i showed a friend of mine this game today, he couldnt figure out why someone would make a game that you were supposed to bot
2011-05-29T20:38:33  <hjax> i also showed him my source code, which he said that i had to have a guide or had copied it from someone else
2011-05-29T20:39:20  <hjax> i was laughing at him :P

2011-05-29T20:46:03  <amstan> or like.. the map id
2011-05-29T20:46:08  <hjax> i should make one :)
2011-05-29T20:46:36  <bhasker> frontier you should take some of the maps from RTS games and convert them
2011-05-29T20:46:42  <bhasker> like sc2 maps or TA maps or something:)
2011-05-29T20:46:54  <hjax> there should be a map with no water at all, it would be interesting,

2011-05-29T20:50:58  <jbroman> (That said, the other bots are often sitting still or oscillating, so:))
2011-05-29T20:50:58  <hjax> i know, my anti suicide code doent appear to work
2011-05-29T20:51:36  <hjax> but Parsley is a very strong bot, it had a bigger population, i still outscored it

2011-05-29T21:16:23  <computerwiz_222> hello
2011-05-29T21:18:05  <_flag> amstan: do you think you could convince him to give you control over the site?
2011-05-29T21:18:40  <amstan> _flag: i do have controll over the site, but i can't do domain, also, i need money for new servers, also, janzert knows more about this
2011-05-29T21:20:39  <_flag> amstan: So are the servers still up somewhere and the domain just isn't pointing to them?
2011-05-29T21:20:50  <amstan> server is up, domain points to the ip
2011-05-29T21:21:07  <amstan> either apache is broken and i didn't point it right
2011-05-29T21:21:13  <amstan> or there's something else
2011-05-29T21:21:30  <_flag> Did you update it recently then?
2011-05-29T21:21:55  <_flag> I thought something might have just expired
2011-05-29T21:29:28  <amstan> it might be expired, that's what i meant by something else
2011-05-29T21:29:43  <amstan> idk though, jeff knows more about the host, i don't wanna smell around
2011-05-29T21:30:31  <amstan> yeah, that's besides the point anyway, we're not even going to keep that server for next contest, since it's an outdated ubuntu
2011-05-29T21:32:58  <computerwiz_222> _flag: i'm using your C starter package and I'm confused why you have #define DOWN Info->cols and then you have int offset = Game->my_ants[i].row*Info->cols + Game->my_ants[i].col;
2011-05-29T21:33:37  <computerwiz_222> could that line not have been int offset = Game->my_ants[i].row*DOWN + Game->my_ants[i].col; ?
2011-05-29T21:33:52  <_flag> It could have, but it doesn't make sense in context
2011-05-29T21:33:53  <amstan> also, what's info->cols?
2011-05-29T21:34:11  <_flag> Why would you mutliply the row number by a downwards direction?
2011-05-29T21:34:34  <computerwiz_222> _flag: fair enough, I was just a little confused, thanks
2011-05-29T21:34:39  <_flag> The DOWN is just to make it easier to understand how I'm traversing the map
2011-05-29T21:34:59  <_flag> computerwiz_222: no problem, it always makes more sense when you write it anyway :P
2011-05-29T21:35:09  <amstan> _flag: why is down defined as such?
2011-05-29T21:35:15  <_flag> What makes sense to me might confuse someone else
2011-05-29T21:35:31  <_flag> I have an array of characters that represents the map
2011-05-29T21:35:59  <_flag> If I want an ant to go down I add DOWN to the current offset
2011-05-29T21:36:17  <computerwiz_222> ah okay, makes sense
2011-05-29T21:38:40  <_flag> computerwiz_222: In my bot I have four functions, North, East, South and West which take an offset as their parameter and output a new offset (and handles map wrap arounds). If that's a more convenient abstraction for you you might want to try that.

2011-05-29T22:09:56  <amstan> how are you running your bot on your iphone?
2011-05-29T22:10:19  <hjax> I'm not, I'm emailing it to myself for on the go editing
2011-05-29T22:10:48  <smiley1983> amstan: to answer the question from before, no easter eggs in this version, it's all random.
2011-05-29T22:11:20  <hjax> I could run it if your code worked on python 2.5, but sadly playgame crashes always on 2.5
2011-05-29T22:11:35  <amstan> yes, it's designed for 2.6/2.7
2011-05-29T22:11:58  <hjax> 2.5 is the newest version packaged for a jailbroken iPhone
2011-05-29T22:12:17  <amstan> may i suggest not trying to program on an iphone?
2011-05-29T22:12:45  <hjax> I don't, most if the time, just when I'm not near my laptop
2011-05-29T22:13:18  * hjax should type slower to avoid all too common mistakes
2011-05-29T22:13:38  <amstan> hjax: ok, let's go back on topic, what's your error? where is it?
2011-05-29T22:13:40  <amstan> line 13?
2011-05-29T22:13:59  <hjax> Yes it says global name ants is not defined
2011-05-29T22:14:01  <amstan> you can't use ants over there, as the error says, it's not defined
2011-05-29T22:14:17  <amstan> ants is only defined in do_turn, since it's an argument to that function
2011-05-29T22:14:29  <amstan> if you wanna use it in fixeddir you'll have to pass it there too
2011-05-29T22:14:57  <hjax> Whoops O.O
2011-05-29T22:15:07  <amstan> or do something smarter
2011-05-29T22:15:50  <amstan> like make ants a member of the class you're in, and update it in do_turn
2011-05-29T22:16:56  * hjax would like to remind everyone that he is 14 and should not be confused unless necessary  
2011-05-29T22:17:26  <amstan> ok, then do what i said the first time
2011-05-29T22:17:40  <amstan> with passing ants to the smaller function
2011-05-29T22:18:01  <hjax> Yeah I know, was being stupid >.<
2011-05-29T22:18:52  <hjax> The good news is my not shouldn't get hung up on water anymore and I might have fixed the suicide problem
2011-05-29T22:19:13  <hjax> *bot (stupid iPhone)
2011-05-29T22:24:10  <hjax> I think I'll go add some code to auto attack enemies, my bot is blind to them atm
