2012-03-17T18:19:33  <thestinger> are you doing that algorithms course on coursera?
2012-03-17T18:19:38  <mcstar> yeah
2012-03-17T18:19:45  <thestinger> is it any good?
2012-03-17T18:19:49  <mcstar> yeah
2012-03-17T18:20:02  <mcstar> it is CRAZY GOOD
2012-03-17T18:20:07  <mcstar> changed my life
2012-03-17T18:20:07  <thestinger> udacity has a whole bunch starting on the 16th (one by peter norvig) but they look too easy
2012-03-17T18:20:10  <thestinger> lol
2012-03-17T18:20:34  <mcstar> it was all about sorting
2012-03-17T18:20:38  <mcstar> divide and conquer
2012-03-17T18:20:50  <mcstar> i dont know whats next
2012-03-17T18:21:50  <thestinger> after I do this programming assignment for the cs373 course I'll start that
2012-03-17T18:22:51  <mcstar> Tim roughgarden's?
2012-03-17T18:23:05  <thestinger> no, the udacity one
2012-03-17T18:23:11  <mcstar> ah
2012-03-17T18:23:16  <thestinger> this week's stuff was just BFS, A* and 'dynamic programming for planning'
2012-03-17T18:23:18  <thestinger> boring :P
2012-03-17T18:23:38  <mcstar> not to a newcomer
2012-03-17T18:23:41  <mcstar> python?
2012-03-17T18:23:49  <thestinger> yes
2012-03-17T18:23:55  <thestinger> doesn't really take advantage of python though
2012-03-17T18:24:01  <thestinger> the course would be similar in java
2012-03-17T18:24:25  <thestinger> this homework assignment does look interesting though
2012-03-17T18:26:36  <mcstar> im up to my arse in work
2012-03-17T18:28:11  <thestinger> I am paranoid about their stupid autograder now
