2010-10-19T00:20:05  <jmcarthur> bhasker: the way to stay out of the git/hg debate is to use darcs ;)
2010-10-19T00:20:17  <bhasker> svn 4tw
2010-10-19T00:20:21  <jmcarthur> ugh
2010-10-19T00:20:25  <bhasker> svn works for me:)
2010-10-19T00:20:38  <bhasker> for managing 5 files i don't need anyting more than svn/cvs
2010-10-19T00:20:54  <jmcarthur> yeah, where "works" is "does what it's designed to do" and not "makes your life easier"
2010-10-19T00:21:14  <bhasker> well all i really wanted was to be able to revision the code so that i can take major releases and go back and forth
2010-10-19T00:21:19  <bhasker> i am not branching/merging my code
2010-10-19T00:21:20  <jmcarthur> svn and cvs are a lot heavier than the distributed ones
2010-10-19T00:21:41  <bhasker> for the bot its not complicated enough to justify a debate:)
2010-10-19T00:21:44  <jmcarthur> so "don't need anything more" isn't really an argument there :P

2010-10-19T00:22:17  <jmcarthur> bhasker: that's the same argument people use against version control entirely
2010-10-19T00:22:22  <a1k0n> i have like 7 branches of my code, all of which are abandoned
2010-10-19T00:22:32  <bhasker> maybe i should branch my code
2010-10-19T00:22:34  <jmcarthur> "all i need is 'Save As'"
2010-10-19T00:22:40  <a1k0n> i use git-svn at work, heh
2010-10-19T00:22:44  <bhasker> been lazy to branch code
2010-10-19T00:22:52  <bhasker> i almost always develop on head
2010-10-19T00:23:02  <bhasker> unless i am making major changes
2010-10-19T00:23:25  <jmcarthur> i have probably about 10 "faux" branches
2010-10-19T00:23:25  <a1k0n> i do too, kinda, but once you get used to git and git-svn i'm technically always working on my own branch, and selectively commit things to trunk
2010-10-19T00:23:41  <jmcarthur> which is just patches that i'm tentatively using but may remove at any time
2010-10-19T00:23:44  <a1k0n> reordering commits and stuff is kinda nifty
2010-10-19T00:23:46  <bhasker> goes against the whole work code commit philosophy:)
2010-10-19T00:23:59  <bhasker> you should read the CI pages:)
2010-10-19T00:24:19  <a1k0n> not really... anything that's "ready" for other people to see gets committed to trunk.  anything experimental does not.
2010-10-19T00:24:31  <a1k0n> it's not like i hold onto branches for months at a time... usually..
2010-10-19T00:24:43  <bhasker> :)
2010-10-19T00:24:49  <a1k0n> also phsaw, CI.  who does that?
2010-10-19T00:24:53  <jmcarthur> even branches that are many months old aren't necessarily bad
2010-10-19T00:25:16  <jmcarthur> especially if your VCS makes it really easy to keep in sync with upstream anyway
2010-10-19T00:25:36  <jmcarthur> if it's not ready for trunk, it definitely shouldn't be in trunk
2010-10-19T00:25:38  <a1k0n> frickin' yinst_create w/ srcdirs though.  can't do that from a git repo cuz it wants svnzip
2010-10-19T00:26:02  <bhasker> :D
2010-10-19T00:26:06  <jmcarthur> i have no idea what you're talking about now

2010-10-19T00:27:15  <a1k0n> i am now downloading data from dhartmei faster than i can process it with my mapper/reducer
2010-10-19T00:27:17  <jmcarthur> i worked with an ex-yahoo guy once. he never intentionally said anything negative about it, but his tales nonetheless convinced me that i would probably much rather continue to work at smaller companies

2010-10-19T01:28:02  <rwa> not at all
2010-10-19T01:28:12  <rwa> just mentioning something relatively close by global standards
2010-10-19T01:28:36  <Epona666> whats a good version of linux to dl
2010-10-19T01:28:39  <antimatroid> ah yes okay, we have a mutual rivalry with new zealand, and frankly i think we win
2010-10-19T01:28:47  <rwa> gotcha
2010-10-19T01:28:47  <Zannick> most likely i will do one of three things: give up on my c bot and become an admin to fix problems, give up on my c bot and write a new one in python, finish the c bot and stop
2010-10-19T01:29:20  <Epona666> isn't there something called cpython
2010-10-19T01:29:24  <amstan> Zannick: you don't have to give up on a bot

2010-10-19T01:29:34  <rwa> If my wife doesn't divorce me first, I am going to finish my C++ bot.  And hell, if she does I'll have more time to finish it.
2010-10-19T01:29:40  <amstan> Epona666: cpython is the standard implementation for python
2010-10-19T01:30:00  <amstan> Epona666: there is a thing called cython, which is basically python compiled to c
2010-10-19T01:30:05  <amstan> Epona666: which becomes a lot faster
2010-10-19T01:30:17  <rwa> Epona:  I would say ubuntu is a nice linux to dl

2010-10-19T01:31:21  <Epona666> im gonna torrent it
2010-10-19T01:31:45  <rwa> I've settled on ubuntu for my linux installations for my home boxes
2010-10-19T01:32:05  <antimatroid> amstan: i didn't sleep on saturday night, i blame you
2010-10-19T01:32:20  <amstan> Epona666: torrenting linux is a very good idea, it's usually as fast as normal downloads
2010-10-19T01:32:33  <amstan> and it increases security too, if you get the torrent file from the official site
2010-10-19T01:32:41  <amstan> antimatroid: what did i do?
2010-10-19T01:33:01  <rwa> anti: what kind of job in ai?  I really don't know wha kind of jobs in ai there are.
2010-10-19T01:33:22  <sigh> ooh... I want a job as an AI

2010-10-19T06:48:43  <codefun> Bye
2010-10-19T06:50:31  <antimatroid> it was easy to make ones bot minimise the number of turns till it won with the payoff function
2010-10-19T06:50:35  <antimatroid> that's a lot harder this time
2010-10-19T06:50:46  <antimatroid> for tron****
2010-10-19T06:51:08  <codefun> I've never done tron... thought if I knew about the contest I would've entered.
2010-10-19T06:51:15  <codefun> It looks like an interesting project.
2010-10-19T06:51:23  <antimatroid> it was pretty cool
2010-10-19T06:51:27  <antimatroid> much simpler
2010-10-19T06:51:42  <codefun> Meh then it can't have been THAT cool ;)
2010-10-19T06:52:08  <antimatroid> just because something is easier doesn't necessarily make it less fun or interesting
2010-10-19T06:52:22  <codefun> I know it was just a joke.
2010-10-19T06:52:24  <antimatroid> you had more options open to you to try
2010-10-19T06:52:33  <antimatroid> although minimax reined
2010-10-19T06:54:05  <codefun> Odd...
2010-10-19T06:54:11  <codefun> I have an embarassing perl problem.
2010-10-19T06:54:30  <codefun> Apparently it doesn't like me using variables in "if" statements, anymore....
2010-10-19T06:55:01  <antimatroid> c++ lets me do almost everything (doesn't have operator precedence overloading ffs)
2010-10-19T06:55:21  <codefun> Hmm, nice
2010-10-19T06:55:39  <codefun> I WAS using C# until I heard about the glitches, and realized perl would be way easier for most tasks.
2010-10-19T06:56:24  <codefun> oh BAH I found the problem
2010-10-19T06:56:47  <codefun> Strict and warnings. My least favorite modules, prevented my bot from running :D
2010-10-19T06:59:03  <antimatroid> i have a language question of my own for someone, is it better to pass and return a reference or return an object/vector of objects?
2010-10-19T06:59:24  <antimatroid> i'm trying to clean things up to see how far I can actually generate my tree
2010-10-19T06:59:27  <antimatroid> atm it's not very far
2010-10-19T07:00:56  <codefun> Not sure, to be honest I'm a perl guy and hate object oriented programming, mostly...

2010-10-19T07:23:52  <dmj111> antimatroid: i always hate creating an empty object just to have a reference to use.  But, if you return a new object, you have to make sure you are not copying a new one.  So.... it comes down to which one looks cleaner :/
2010-10-19T07:33:06  <antimatroid> dmj111: yeah it's annoying, i've gone with passing in a reference, just in case it makes any performance difference

2010-10-19T07:35:46  <antimatroid> yeah, it's where i can test and update
2010-10-19T07:35:59  <antimatroid> rather than upload, wait 5 hours, make change, upload, wait 25 hours, etc.
2010-10-19T07:38:17  <Error323> yea

2010-10-19T07:46:16  <Error323> dmj111: dare I ask, do you use sth beyond heuristics?
2010-10-19T07:46:38  <dmj111> Error323: you may dare, and I don't really.
2010-10-19T07:47:14  <dmj111> since I cannot predict what the opponent can do, I do things they cannot stop.
2010-10-19T07:47:30  <dmj111> I also do some things that open my position up in a bad way too :(
2010-10-19T07:48:40  <dmj111> I am trying something new, which will go a little further than I have been doing, but it is still not searching a game tree.
2010-10-19T07:48:47  <dmj111> but it sucks at the moment.
2010-10-19T07:49:37  <dmj111> antimatroid: another advantage of python -- anything I do is likely to be slower than C++, so I can pick what looks best.
2010-10-19T07:50:08  <Error323> cool
2010-10-19T07:50:22  <Error323> I implemented alphabeta in an old approach
2010-10-19T07:50:45  <Error323> but its not that effective, I need very very well defined action
2010-10-19T07:50:48  <Error323> actions*
2010-10-19T07:51:00  <Error323> which is quite a hassle hehe
2010-10-19T07:51:08  <Error323> so i got back to heuristics aswell

2010-10-19T08:18:18  <dmj111> Ahh, I remember the ranking thing.  They eventually took that down, didn't they?
2010-10-19T08:21:06  <antimatroid> yep
2010-10-19T08:21:10  <antimatroid> might have been costing them too much

2010-10-19T08:44:10  <antimatroid> i have a different approach now
2010-10-19T08:44:16  <antimatroid> still using a tree though
2010-10-19T08:44:28  <antimatroid> going to take a few more hours at least to get it up and running though
2010-10-19T08:47:49  <gerald512k> i was wondering yesterday about one thing. It would have been a great idea that the problem of finding the best algorithm in planetwars would be the same that a problem of finding an algorythm in an other domain, like trading for example :) so our work could be usefull for other purposes
2010-10-19T08:48:14  <gerald512k> maybe it is already the case? :)
2010-10-19T08:58:25  <antimatroid> ha, i no longer even get a consistent result when running my tree bot against another one on the same map with same starting positions
2010-10-19T09:00:32  <Error323> heh i had that exact same problem ^_^

2010-10-19T09:16:05  <bhasker> morning folks
2010-10-19T09:20:53  <mega1> morning
2010-10-19T09:22:19  <rabidus> evening
2010-10-19T09:23:32  <bhasker> how goes it
2010-10-19T09:24:18  <bhasker> my latest upload seems to be doing decenly on the official servers, though rank gain is so slow:-\
2010-10-19T09:28:06  <mega1> is a bot allowed to write junk to stderr?
2010-10-19T09:29:48  <mega1> "It silently absorbs your stderr stream"
2010-10-19T09:32:12  <rabidus> afaik: you can't write anything, anywhere in the file system
2010-10-19T09:32:51  <antimatroid> yep, i just debug to a file
2010-10-19T09:35:58  <bhasker> mega1: enable logging on your system to stderr, when uploading to server just disable the logs
2010-10-19T09:36:11  <bhasker> the java viewer/c++ viewer both capture your log stream
2010-10-19T09:36:20  <mega1> the spec says that "It silently absorbs your stderr stream"
2010-10-19T09:36:25  <mega1> so it should be fine.
2010-10-19T09:36:35  <bhasker> it might be, but disabling is better
2010-10-19T09:36:39  <bhasker> since logging costs cpu
2010-10-19T09:36:48  <bhasker> and since you can't really get the logs
2010-10-19T09:36:51  <bhasker> might as well disable it

2010-10-19T11:18:42  <phreeza> antimatroid: is antimatroid your tree searching bot on the tcp server?
2010-10-19T11:18:44  <phreeza> websmith: sorry i have no clue...
2010-10-19T11:20:46  <JamesMG> websmith: I've gotten by just uploading a handful of times before it works
2010-10-19T11:20:55  <JamesMG> so it's possible, if frustrating
2010-10-19T11:21:56  <antimatroid> phreeza: it is, but it's a fairly crappy one
2010-10-19T11:22:04  <antimatroid> i'm working on a different one atm
2010-10-19T11:22:48  <phreeza> it anihilated mine, but it really sucks... i'm still trying to tweak it but i think i will have to change concepts soon, this is not going anywhere

2010-10-19T11:25:20  <JamesMG> how did you score a logistics move like that, if you don't mind sharing?
2010-10-19T11:25:26  <antimatroid> it's basically picking some feasible pure strategies and making a tree with them
2010-10-19T11:25:58  <antimatroid> ourShips - theirShips + timeRemaining(ourGrowth - theirGrowth)
2010-10-19T11:26:04  <antimatroid> i didn't come up with that so i shall share
2010-10-19T11:26:24  <antimatroid> keeps things zero sum as well
2010-10-19T11:26:40  <JamesMG> yeah, that's how I scored mine as well
2010-10-19T11:27:03  <antimatroid> although, i am going a fairly different approach with a tree atm as i couldn't get it winning consistently that way
2010-10-19T11:27:04  <JamesMG> so each "move" is more like a plan across turns, or multiple orders on one turn?
2010-10-19T11:27:35  <JamesMG> I tried doing a tree using subsets of individual potential orders but it ended up slow and dumb, hehe :)
2010-10-19T11:27:54  <antimatroid> each node has a player moving, it increments states on player 1's turns and starts at a player 1 turn, then each child involves the player having picked a number of moves
2010-10-19T11:28:20  <antimatroid> it can't do more than like 300 states like that though, but i think i'm doing stupid amounts of calculation too
2010-10-19T11:29:51  <Error323> i got 30K nodes per second
2010-10-19T11:30:02  <Error323> a node being a move of a player
2010-10-19T11:30:23  <Error323> this was on a quadcore 2.66 ghz though
2010-10-19T11:30:25  <phreeza> my number of nodes depends a lot on the number of fleets... somewhere around 10K/s
2010-10-19T11:30:42  <antimatroid> i think i'm doing something very wrong somewhere
2010-10-19T11:30:54  <JamesMG> mine was starting to have issues when it owned a significant number of planets, 10+
2010-10-19T11:30:56  <antimatroid> or my functions to pick moves are just doing too many calculations
2010-10-19T11:31:06  <antimatroid> i did a pretty decent clean before though, so i think it's the later
2010-10-19T11:31:08  <JamesMG> since it was basing it's potential move base on it's owned planets
2010-10-19T11:31:45  <phreeza> antimatroid: do you advance time until no fleets are left when you evaluate a leaf node?
2010-10-19T11:32:51  <phreeza> thats what costs most time for me

2010-10-19T11:50:23  <TrilceAC> Hi
2010-10-19T11:50:47  <JamesMG> hi
2010-10-19T11:51:25  <TrilceAC> Hi James.
2010-10-19T11:51:52  <TrilceAC> I was trying to use the TCP server to test my bot, but I'm stuck
2010-10-19T11:52:14  <TrilceAC> I uploaded it yesterday and it has only played one match.
2010-10-19T11:53:59  <Naktibalda> you don't upload to TCP
2010-10-19T11:54:05  <Naktibalda> you must have it running in your computer
2010-10-19T11:54:09  <JamesMG> You need to continually run your bot locally using whichever TCP client you have
2010-10-19T11:54:30  <JamesMG> think of it more as a matchmaking/bridge service
2010-10-19T11:55:49  <TrilceAC> ./tcp 72.44.46.68 995 TrilceAC -p somepasswd "python MyBot.py"
2010-10-19T11:56:45  <TrilceAC> But noway to run it: execv: python MyBot.py: No such file or directory
2010-10-19T11:57:14  <TrilceAC> I'm trying to use this: http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/
2010-10-19T11:57:48  <phreeza> TrilceAC: try adding a shebang in the head of you python file and chmod +x it
2010-10-19T11:57:49  <JamesMG> that looks correct, but you can't run your bot in that location?
2010-10-19T11:58:12  <phreeza> thats how i do it

2010-10-19T12:04:13  <TrilceAC> I tried the shebang, but still stuck. I must see what does "\r" means
2010-10-19T12:05:59  <TrilceAC> I uploaded my bot yesterday, 18 hours ago. It has only played 1 match. Does the server go so slow usually?

2010-10-19T14:56:48  <mega1> I mean using a non-stable sort can depend on memory addresses
2010-10-19T14:57:18  <rebelxt> ok, but you can easily make it deterministic by making sorts stable
2010-10-19T14:57:21  <mega1> and the timeouts can change things drastically
2010-10-19T14:57:25  <mega1> yes
2010-10-19T14:57:52  <mega1> I'll test using mixed strategies at some point
2010-10-19T14:58:26  <mega1> ... after actually getting around to searching two plies deep.

2010-10-19T15:00:47  <rebelxt> yeah - that's the reason i was asking. using random factor to pick diff strategies is bad for debugging :(

2010-10-19T15:01:50  <mega1> are you now UCTing?
2010-10-19T15:03:05  <rebelxt> yes - but not getting any promising results at this point
2010-10-19T15:03:39  <mega1> why? too few playouts?
2010-10-19T15:04:24  <mega1> or is it because like tron this is another game that' about balancing on a knife edge?
2010-10-19T15:05:00  <rebelxt> bad data structures, weak pruning, can't analyze deep enough
2010-10-19T15:05:28  <mega1> pruning?
2010-10-19T15:05:33  <mega1> move selection?
2010-10-19T15:06:07  <rebelxt> currently trying only up to 2 moves per turn per player
2010-10-19T15:06:08  <lavalamp_> mega1 is your bot a bunch of heuristics or something else?
2010-10-19T15:06:30  <mega1> I'm always confused what people mean by that.
2010-10-19T15:06:40  <mega1> it's not scripted
2010-10-19T15:06:48  <lavalamp_> do you do minimax or anything like that?
2010-10-19T15:06:58  <mega1> but has an evaluation function that I tune.
2010-10-19T15:07:31  <mega1> one ply minimax :-)
2010-10-19T15:07:35  <lavalamp_> ah
2010-10-19T15:07:37  <mega1> or alpha-beta.
2010-10-19T15:07:48  <lavalamp_> I'm working on one like that
2010-10-19T15:08:08  <JamesMG> how is it coming along lavalamp_?
2010-10-19T15:08:13  <lavalamp_> how do you come up with move candidates if you don't mind me asking?
2010-10-19T15:08:33  <lavalamp_> JamesMG: not much progress since yesterday... :(
2010-10-19T15:08:51  <JamesMG> mine infinitely loops on turn1 now
2010-10-19T15:08:55  <JamesMG> I'm calling that progress
2010-10-19T15:09:15  <rebelxt> haha
2010-10-19T15:09:18  <lavalamp_> I did fix my crashes and assertions, so I guess that's progress
2010-10-19T15:09:38  <mega1> lavalamp_: nothing special, just looking at the simulated future
2010-10-19T15:09:57  <Error323> you must be pruning on the actionspace
2010-10-19T15:10:00  <Error323> surely
2010-10-19T15:10:07  <lavalamp_> mega1: cool, hopefully my bot will turn out that well then :)
2010-10-19T15:10:33  <mega1> sure, I'm not consider hopeless attacks.

2010-10-19T15:14:07  <rebelxt> weird since it's pounding bots to death on tcp with no forfeits
2010-10-19T15:14:14  <rebelxt> what language?
2010-10-19T15:14:49  <mega1> lisp
2010-10-19T15:15:03  <mega1> they have an ancient sbcl installed
2010-10-19T15:15:07  <a1k0n> probably not letting sbcl use enough heap

2010-10-19T15:15:24  <rebelxt> ahh
2010-10-19T15:15:43  <mega1> a1k0n: but sbcl mmaps at the beginning and later doesn't grow
2010-10-19T15:15:53  <mega1> and it loses at random points
2010-10-19T15:16:06  <a1k0n> yeah it overcommits but it's probably the physical pages that it's running out of
2010-10-19T15:16:23  <a1k0n> i forgot how danielvf set the limits
2010-10-19T15:16:32  <mega1> ???
2010-10-19T15:16:36  <mega1> did he set it?
2010-10-19T15:16:39  <lavalamp_> at least lisp runs at all on the server :(
2010-10-19T15:17:09  <a1k0n> they were limiting address space for a while but it immediately broke java (obviously - for the same reason)
2010-10-19T15:17:58  <mega1> a1k0n: and now they limit resident size?
2010-10-19T15:19:13  <mega1> that would likely result in a timeout when the gc is swapping
2010-10-19T15:19:31  <mega1> but then a lot of java folks would see it too, I guess
2010-10-19T15:20:22  <Zannick> you also are not doing stderr output, right?

2010-10-19T15:21:34  <mega1> Zannick: I think I tried without stderr output too although the spec allows it.
2010-10-19T15:21:59  <Zannick> i'll have to reread the spec on that
2010-10-19T15:22:17  <Zannick> but the engine does not read from your bot's stderr, so you can deadlock if the pipe fills
2010-10-19T15:22:37  <mega1> grrr
2010-10-19T15:22:59  <Zannick> i saw one person with that problem a month or so ago

2010-10-19T15:25:28  <Zannick> looks like there's even a function "read_error_line" for the Sadbox
2010-10-19T15:25:53  <Zannick> i guess something should call that
2010-10-19T15:25:56  <a1k0n> haha
2010-10-19T15:26:09  <Zannick> maybe the monitor_input_channel thread
2010-10-19T15:27:05  <mega1> I'll double check stderr usage.

2010-10-19T15:29:27  <Zannick> that won't look suspicious at all
2010-10-19T15:30:17  <Error323> is there any chance of more servers activating again these days?

2010-10-19T15:37:47  <janzert> not sure on j3camero but I know danielvf said he was going to be gone for the rest of the month
2010-10-19T15:38:42  <lavalamp_> what do you think my chances are of having one of them install golang before the end of the contest?
2010-10-19T15:38:43  * janzert tried to start some new instances but it seems there is a problem on the main server that is preventing it right now and I don't have that access atm

2010-10-19T18:59:45  <bhasker> was just watching my games have one more bug to fix was wondering whats a good way to do it

2010-10-19T19:03:58  <McLeopold> what's the game?
2010-10-19T19:04:33  <McLeopold> bhasker...
2010-10-19T19:04:43  <bhasker> here
2010-10-19T19:04:49  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=575935
2010-10-19T19:04:52  <bhasker> basically i wa sahead
2010-10-19T19:04:56  <bhasker> but acquired two neutrals at the same time
2010-10-19T19:04:57  <bhasker> and died
2010-10-19T19:05:07  <bhasker> i know why the bug is happening
2010-10-19T19:05:15  <bhasker> i try to make up any loss in production
2010-10-19T19:05:18  *** Itkovian <Itkovian!~Itkovian@vpnd187.ugent.be> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-19T19:05:31  <bhasker> and don't keep track of which planets i am acquiring in the current turn
2010-10-19T19:05:39  <bhasker> so ended up double launching to make up a production difference of one
2010-10-19T19:05:49  <bhasker> and lost the ship advantage
2010-10-19T19:06:06  <McLeopold> I had that "bug".
2010-10-19T19:06:24  <bhasker> need to add stuff to track planets in acquisition
2010-10-19T19:06:34  <McLeopold> After every order issued, I recalculate the growth to see if I still need to acquire.
2010-10-19T19:06:35  <bhasker> especially this happens because i do coordinated launches
2010-10-19T19:06:52  <McLeopold> coordinated launches are tough.

2010-10-19T19:07:02  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-19T19:07:06  <bhasker> thats what complicates the issue
2010-10-19T19:07:08  <McLeopold> I still have small fleets flying into neutral with no effect.
2010-10-19T19:07:25  <bhasker> i don't have that unless i use it as a staging
2010-10-19T19:07:32  <bhasker> since i stage to planets that will belong to me in future
2010-10-19T19:07:36  <McLeopold> I'm wondering if coordinating is even worth it.
2010-10-19T19:07:39  <bhasker> sometimes small fleets arrive before the coordinated launch
2010-10-19T19:07:49  <bhasker> actually my bot is doing much better since i added that
2010-10-19T19:08:26  <McLeopold> I've seen really good bots that stream into neutrals and enemies.
2010-10-19T19:08:32  <bhasker> i added a bunch of other stuff and changed my cost function
2010-10-19T19:08:41  <bhasker> for knapsack at start
2010-10-19T19:08:49  <bhasker> it looks counterintuitive but works quite well
2010-10-19T19:09:03  <McLeopold> You seem to have really good starts now.
2010-10-19T19:09:47  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-19T19:09:54  <bhasker> changing my cost function did that

2010-10-19T19:10:16  <bhasker> also i changed stuff like don't do anything if you are ahead
2010-10-19T19:10:26  <bhasker> basically as long as i am ahead my bot doesn't acquire any neutrals
2010-10-19T19:10:34  <contestbot> Top 10 players: rsergio(3911), cfaftw(3898), dmj111(3872), deepblue(3825), savchenko(3802), DocBot(3796), Rexxar(3723), oldman(3710), sequoh(3701), chotting(3698)
2010-10-19T19:10:42  <McLeopold> that's what CrowBot did, and it worked.
2010-10-19T19:10:44  <bhasker> also i changed my logic of how/when to forward ships
2010-10-19T19:10:54  <bhasker> but i make up the moment enemy launches
2010-10-19T19:11:03  <bhasker> either i will acquire a safe neutral or attack the one enemy is attacking

2010-10-19T19:16:44  <bhasker> another interesting game
2010-10-19T19:17:26  <tty2> hey guys hows the AI going?
2010-10-19T19:17:54  <McLeopold> bhasker: even if you did want to take that last neutral, you should have known you needed more than ships+1
2010-10-19T19:18:17  <bhasker> hmm which game are you referring to
2010-10-19T19:18:21  <McLeopold> the first one
2010-10-19T19:19:35  <bhasker> the one against dhartmei?
2010-10-19T19:19:53  <McLeopold> 	jambachili4
2010-10-19T19:20:18  <bhasker> ah that one
2010-10-19T19:20:31  <McLeopold> or at least know that it would take you ship count below the enemies
2010-10-19T19:21:22  <bhasker> so the thing is the way i make up for production ignores the fact that i might drop below in ships
2010-10-19T19:21:37  <bhasker> mostly though if i hadn't launched the center one
2010-10-19T19:21:41  <bhasker> it would have been fine
2010-10-19T19:21:43  <McLeopold> well, if you thought you were behind, then that's an issue
2010-10-19T19:22:04  <bhasker> the issue was at turn 50
2010-10-19T19:22:12  <McLeopold> but yeah, one growth more and a thousand ships down is bad
2010-10-19T19:22:13  <bhasker> he tries to acquire the 14 growth planet
2010-10-19T19:22:15  <bhasker> oops
2010-10-19T19:22:25  <bhasker> i mean 14 size
2010-10-19T19:22:35  <McLeopold> 14+?
2010-10-19T19:22:38  <McLeopold> what was the growth
2010-10-19T19:22:51  <bhasker> it would have brought him level i think
2010-10-19T19:23:00  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-19T19:23:01  <bhasker> actually
2010-10-19T19:23:05  <bhasker> i shouldnt have done anything
2010-10-19T19:23:15  <McLeopold> nope, if you have more ships, you can just sit there
2010-10-19T19:23:20  <bhasker> yea mistake
2010-10-19T19:23:21  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-19T19:23:24  <bhasker> will have to look at the code
2010-10-19T19:23:40  <bhasker> didnt realize i was going to be level without doing anything
2010-10-19T19:24:13  <bhasker> time to look at logs

2010-10-19T19:33:37  <bhasker> figured out why my bot did that  at turn 44 i was low on ships but ahead on production and my check was only when i was ahead on both that i don't acquire
2010-10-19T19:33:47  <bhasker> so when i fell behind on ships it went through its usual acquisition process
2010-10-19T19:34:01  <bhasker> added a check to not acquire stuff when ahead on production but low on ships

2010-10-19T19:46:42  <gerald5122k> sorry i got disconnection !
2010-10-19T19:49:23  <McLeopold> I wish they would take RageBot off of tcp.
2010-10-19T19:49:31  <bhasker> why?
2010-10-19T19:49:43  <McLeopold> It's a waste of my time.
2010-10-19T19:50:03  <bhasker> heh true
2010-10-19T19:50:07  <a1k0n> the number of games played on tcp is truly staggering
2010-10-19T19:50:30  <McLeopold> 576707 so far...
2010-10-19T19:50:53  <a1k0n> i've captured 85382 since friday afternoon
2010-10-19T19:51:13  <McLeopold> wow, CrowBot sucks now?
2010-10-19T19:51:33  <bhasker> yea looks like it
2010-10-19T19:51:34  <bhasker> lol
2010-10-19T19:51:50  <bhasker> thats one thing i have seen, bots are getting better faster than i can improve mine:-\
2010-10-19T19:52:07  <bhasker> so my bot is like either in same place or constantly dropping ^
2010-10-19T19:52:34  <McLeopold> I think I did something to it...
2010-10-19T19:53:10  <McLeopold> hmm...
2010-10-19T19:54:41  <gerald5122k> The letter D when i loose means i got DCed ?
2010-10-19T19:55:35  <Zannick> crowbot is making some pretty poor decisions with regard to neutrals
2010-10-19T19:56:09  <bhasker> D means probably you have a coding error
2010-10-19T19:56:11  <bhasker> and your bot crashed
2010-10-19T19:56:13  <bhasker> probably
2010-10-19T19:56:18  <McLeopold> yeah, I did something bad...
2010-10-19T19:56:23  <bhasker> maybe divide by zero?
2010-10-19T19:56:32  <Zannick> d= disconnected

2010-10-19T19:57:18  <McLeopold> good thing I've got svn :)
2010-10-19T19:57:18  <gerald5122k> yes my isp is sleeping like me mayB. are you all workin on your bot at this time?
2010-10-19T19:59:41  <gerald5122k> level is so imba on tcp server, it is good for training :)

2010-10-19T20:01:36  <McLeopold> I've reverted, hopefully that fixes it.
2010-10-19T20:01:40  <bhasker> you are spreading your attacks
2010-10-19T20:01:54  <bhasker> far too much to little effect
2010-10-19T20:02:06  <bhasker> and not defending your planets
2010-10-19T20:02:46  <bhasker> i think that did the trick mcleopold
2010-10-19T20:02:52  <bhasker> crowbot seems to be winning now
2010-10-19T20:03:08  <McLeopold> gerald5122k: the opening looked good, but yes, you need defense.
2010-10-19T20:03:19  <McLeopold> It's pretty easy to get basic defense.
2010-10-19T20:03:39  <McLeopold> Calculate the incoming enemy and check if you go negative.
2010-10-19T20:03:50  <McLeopold> If so, send that many fleets as soon as possible.

2010-10-19T20:51:22  <smloh1> i'm trying to shift my bot over to a cleaner, more OO set of data structures, but it is a real pain...
2010-10-19T20:51:41  <amstan> smloh1: do it anyway, it's good experience
2010-10-19T20:52:45  <smloh1> amstan: yeah, that's what i get for growing my code organically instead of sitting down and planning it out.  should help with further development too
2010-10-19T20:53:12  <amstan> idk..
2010-10-19T20:53:15  <amstan> what i generally do
2010-10-19T20:53:22  <amstan> is plan the code when i'm not at a computer
2010-10-19T20:53:28  <amstan> then code and rewrite code when i am
2010-10-19T20:53:45  <amstan> works fairly well, and i don't get bored at other times
2010-10-19T20:55:29  <smloh1> that's a good process.  i just need to be less impatient in getting ideas out to test.
2010-10-19T20:57:25  <bhasker> smloh1 first version of my bot was a mess becuase i just used the starter kit and built on it
2010-10-19T20:57:32  <bhasker> without thinking where what function should go
2010-10-19T20:57:44  <bhasker> i rewrote the core completely with better abstraction
2010-10-19T20:57:48  <bhasker> and it has helped a lot
2010-10-19T20:57:52  <bhasker> less bugs
2010-10-19T20:58:00  <bhasker> and better logging etc etc

2010-10-19T20:59:56  <smloh1> yeah it is hard to catch bugs among a mess.  i'm looking forward to the new version working properly
2010-10-19T21:00:19  <bhasker> yup i had bugs with my defense code
2010-10-19T21:00:28  <bhasker> and i tried to fix it multiple times
2010-10-19T21:00:43  <bhasker> finally decided it was easier to start again and rewrote my state management code
2010-10-19T21:00:54  <bhasker> so its clear what state the map is in at any point
2010-10-19T21:01:30  <smloh1> bhasker did you also rewrite the starter package's non-bot code?  like, for me in java, planetwars.java etc
2010-10-19T21:01:42  <bhasker> not much but i added a bunch of stuff to it
2010-10-19T21:01:52  <bhasker> like finding planets within a certain distance etc
2010-10-19T21:02:06  <bhasker> and changed it so that it doesn't walk the arrays again and again to build lists
2010-10-19T21:02:08  <bhasker> etc
2010-10-19T21:02:25  <bhasker> also looked at ulopes starter kit and changed the internal planet ids to be stable
2010-10-19T21:02:33  <bhasker> and not use the server id
2010-10-19T21:02:58  <smloh1> i thought the planet ids were supposed to be stable?
2010-10-19T21:03:09  <smloh1> the specification says they would be in the same order i think
2010-10-19T21:03:09  <bhasker> they
2010-10-19T21:03:11  <bhasker> are
2010-10-19T21:03:14  <bhasker> but since you iterate over them
2010-10-19T21:03:23  <bhasker> you play differently whether you start as player 1 or player 2
2010-10-19T21:03:48  <bhasker> sometimes you would end up picking one planet over the other depending on the order in which you iterate over them
2010-10-19T21:03:51  <smloh1> ah i see what you mean
2010-10-19T21:04:23  <smloh1> i tried to avoid that by sorting them by "centrality"
2010-10-19T21:04:55  <bhasker> yea i do that too,but there are some places where sort them and iterate etc
2010-10-19T21:05:16  <bhasker> anyway i don't think that is very important
2010-10-19T21:05:47  <smloh1> probably mainly something to keep in mind if debugging why one planet over the other
2010-10-19T21:06:00  <bhasker> i looked at ulope's python starter kit , it was very nice but i had trouble following his code ^
2010-10-19T21:06:06  <bhasker> so i just cleaned up mine
2010-10-19T21:06:10  <amstan> anyone here a perl guy?
2010-10-19T21:06:28  <bhasker> well i do know a bit of perl but not very fond of it
2010-10-19T21:06:41  <amstan> do you know how to explicitly delete objects?
2010-10-19T21:06:50  <amstan> kinda like how del in python works
2010-10-19T21:07:04  <bhasker> undef $?
2010-10-19T21:07:08  <bhasker> undef $var
2010-10-19T21:07:08  <bhasker> ?
2010-10-19T21:07:15  <bhasker> i think that should work
2010-10-19T21:07:21  <amstan> will that deallocate the memory too?
2010-10-19T21:07:33  <amstan> i have this script, and it memory leaks: http://bitbucket.org/songexe/jobmine-checker/src/6049174c5786/jobmine-interviews.pl
2010-10-19T21:07:34  <bhasker> well in perl or python you can't guarantee that
2010-10-19T21:07:43  <amstan> it's probably in the check function
2010-10-19T21:07:50  <bhasker> that will happen when garbage collector runs
2010-10-19T21:08:45  <bhasker> i don't se why that script will leak memory
2010-10-19T21:08:51  <bhasker> almost all the variables are function local
2010-10-19T21:09:00  <bhasker> so it should get deallocated
2010-10-19T21:09:02  <amstan> that mechanize thingy maybe
2010-10-19T21:09:19  <amstan> so.. it loads a hideous website, it might have some javascript in there that leaks
2010-10-19T21:09:22  <bhasker> maybe it has some close/destroy functions you need to call?
2010-10-19T21:09:31  <bhasker> thats possible too?
2010-10-19T21:09:35  <amstan> i couldn't find any..
2010-10-19T21:09:39  <bhasker> i am not very familiar with Mechanize module

2010-10-19T21:10:56  <bhasker> i think you might be leaking in the TreeBuilder code
2010-10-19T21:11:01  <bhasker> you probably need to call some function on that
2010-10-19T21:11:04  <bhasker> to release the dom tree
2010-10-19T21:11:19  <amstan> i put some dels in there, before every -> new call
