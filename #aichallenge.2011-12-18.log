2011-12-18T00:00:24  <Antimony> I haven't tried to write up anything yet becasue my bot is still changing a lot

2011-12-18T00:01:01  <_flag> One of my biggest worries is actually that my bot may be too patient, eg. http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=264114&user=31
2011-12-18T00:01:10  <_flag> But I suppose that's a good problem to have
2011-12-18T00:03:13  <ChrisH_> Antimony: regarding turn 80, I think you are right, but here is what I think probably happened: Initially my bot wanted to spawn at 30, 63 for two consecutive turns, but when it got to turn 81 it changed is mind because of  a moved target somewhere, so it spawned the second ant at 41,62 instead

2011-12-18T00:04:45  <Gnome> Ahhh man.. hours of fail on my part. My python bot still randomly crashes 5 rounds in.
2011-12-18T00:05:07  <ChrisH_> Antimony: my bot will spawn multiple ants on a turn if there is enough food in the hive and the destinations it wants the ants to go to are distributed in such a way that spawning at different hills is better than spawning at one hill for two turns

2011-12-18T00:05:45  <ChrisH_> but in the case you pointed out it must have changed its mind about where the ants were needed between turns
2011-12-18T00:08:20  <ChrisH_> _flag: that is a tough game you posted.  My bot always has trouble with lazarant and I haven't been able to pin down why

2011-12-18T00:17:56  <hacklash> is there an easy way to query how many ants you have waiting to spawn?

2011-12-18T00:18:28  <ChrisH_> hacklash: no
2011-12-18T00:18:40  <_flag> Interestingly, lazarant did fairly poorly in that game as far as ant count, but won by a large margin
2011-12-18T00:19:12  <hacklash> ok, then what is a good what to calculate/approximate it?
2011-12-18T00:19:26  <ChrisH_> _flag: like I said, I haven't been able to figure out why lazarant does so well
2011-12-18T00:19:46  <Gnome> Anyone in here write their bot in python?
2011-12-18T00:19:51  <ChrisH_> hacklash: hold on a sec and I'll explain
2011-12-18T00:21:08  <ChrisH_> hacklash: 1. you need to remember where all the food you knew about was on the previous turn.
2011-12-18T00:21:39  <ChrisH_> 2. on the current turn check if any of your ants are adjacent to where a food was on the previous turn
2011-12-18T00:22:51  <ChrisH_> and don't count them if an enemy is also adjacent to the same food, because in that case the food is destroyed, but this doesn't happen often since usually the ants die from combat before it can happen
2011-12-18T00:23:16  <ChrisH_> now you know how much food was added to your hive this turn
2011-12-18T00:23:44  <ChrisH_> 3. count how many of your ants died last turn (the server tells you this)
2011-12-18T00:25:13  <ChrisH_> 4. you will also need to remember how many ants you had on the previous turn
2011-12-18T00:25:51  <ChrisH_> Now the forumla for number of ants in the hive is:
2011-12-18T00:26:41  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: _flag: nice to see you guys on tcpants

2011-12-18T00:27:08  <BenJackson> I gave up on fluxid because you have to look at ever game to know if it's a win or an enemy timeout (or loss vs self timeout)
2011-12-18T00:27:30  <BenJackson>     return myInitialAnts + myFoodEaten - state.myAnts.size() - myDeadAnts;
2011-12-18T00:27:55  <ChrisH_> ants_added this turn = food_eaten - current_ant_count + prev_ant_count - dead_ant
2011-12-18T00:28:05  <BenJackson> where shouse values (other than myAnts.size()) can reset any time I go several turns without seeing a spawn
2011-12-18T00:28:36  <BenJackson> and if I do a reset (due to no spawn) when I think I have food I increment a "suspect I'm dead" counter
2011-12-18T00:28:56  <ChrisH_> also, start the hive count at 0 on the first turn and don't do any of this until turn 2
2011-12-18T00:29:11  <hacklash> hmm, ok
2011-12-18T00:29:36  <ChrisH_> then add the results of the formula to the hive count each turn
2011-12-18T00:29:38  <hacklash> it seems strange to me that the visualizer shows this and yet we have to calculate it too
2011-12-18T00:29:59  <ChrisH_> yes, that is strange, but that's the facts
2011-12-18T00:30:08  <hacklash> thanks
2011-12-18T00:30:40  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I just wish I didn't time out so much on tcpants.
2011-12-18T00:30:53  <BenJackson> ditto but on fluxid
2011-12-18T00:30:58  <Antimony> ug, how do I keep having so many bugs?
2011-12-18T00:31:05  <BenJackson> where are you, network wise, relative to tcpants?
2011-12-18T00:31:24  <BenJackson> McLeopold: ah the counter dropped below a day, slick how it dropped the leading box
2011-12-18T00:31:36  <ChrisH_> i have the same problem on fluxid, although more so recently than a week or two ago
2011-12-18T00:31:36  <BenJackson> McLeopold: also looked fine on my android phone when I checked from the ballet :)
2011-12-18T00:32:34  <BenJackson> Antimony: I was really upset when I realized my bot was doing something stupid last night and I was going to have to fix it and resubmit
2011-12-18T00:32:48  <BenJackson> luckily tcpants has provided some validation that I did the right thing
2011-12-18T00:33:10  <Antimony> I just don't get how I can keep making so many stupid mistakes
2011-12-18T00:33:24  <Antimony> I guess the complexity makes it easy to get thigns wrong

2011-12-18T00:33:39  <Antimony> like just now I discovered I ws incorrectly countign enemy threats when determining death
2011-12-18T00:33:54  <Antimony> and before that I was incorrectly generating posisble enemy moves
2011-12-18T00:34:12  <BenJackson> that's one reason I like to methodically break all my changes into commit sets in git
2011-12-18T00:34:17  <BenJackson> that gives me an opportunity to review each one
2011-12-18T00:34:19  <BenJackson> and describe it
2011-12-18T00:34:23  <BenJackson> and if I can't, I've probably messed up
2011-12-18T00:35:01  <Antimony> I doubt that would have helped me much
2011-12-18T00:35:06  <Antimony> maybe it would have caught one or two bugs
2011-12-18T00:35:58  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I tried a traceroute to tcpants.com and got nothing but * * *.  Ping is giving me times in the range of 77 - 97 ms
2011-12-18T00:36:04  <BenJackson> pretty sweet come from behind:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=263978&user=3473
2011-12-18T00:36:11  <BenJackson> although delineate poached one kill
2011-12-18T00:36:23  <BenJackson> those make me think I should be more careful about weakening hill defenses when I might not be able to take
2011-12-18T00:36:44  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: mtr is a good tool
2011-12-18T00:36:59  <Antimony> by the way ChrisH, I'm pretty sure step 2 is impossible
2011-12-18T00:37:24  <BenJackson> Antimony: I do step 2
2011-12-18T00:37:38  <BenJackson> I've tested my hive counter and it's accurate
2011-12-18T00:37:40  <hacklash> ChrisH_: let's see if i got this right: hiveAnts = prevHiveAnts + (foodEaten - antsSpawned) where antsSpawned = curAnts - shouldHaveAnts where shouldHaveAnts = prevAnts - killed
2011-12-18T00:37:43  <BenJackson> I just don't use it
2011-12-18T00:38:07  <BenJackson> hacklash: I think it's a mistake to define it as a recurrence relation
2011-12-18T00:38:14  <BenJackson>     return myInitialAnts + myFoodEaten - state.myAnts.size() - myDeadAnts;

2011-12-18T00:38:17  <BenJackson> that's my function
2011-12-18T00:38:23  <ChrisH_> hacklash: sounds right
2011-12-18T00:38:47  <BenJackson> (myInitialAnts - state.myAnts.size()) cancels out initially
2011-12-18T00:38:48  <ChrisH_> Antimony: no, #2 is entirely possible
2011-12-18T00:38:54  <Antimony> how?
2011-12-18T00:38:57  <BenJackson> then myFoodEaten cancels state.myAnts.size() as you eat and spawn
2011-12-18T00:39:03  <Antimony> they always die first
2011-12-18T00:39:07  <hacklash> BenJackson: its just three local variables
2011-12-18T00:39:09  <BenJackson> and finally myDeadAnts picks up when ants drop off of state.myAnts.size()
2011-12-18T00:39:43  <BenJackson> you don't need to account for spawning at all
2011-12-18T00:40:10  <BenJackson> the only reason I monitor spawning is so that after a period of not spawning I can reset "initial" in case of drift due to some exceptional case
2011-12-18T00:40:14  <ChrisH_> Antimony: oh, the part about enemy ants next to the same food, that might be impossible, but that's what the game spec happens, so I coded it
2011-12-18T00:41:01  <ChrisH_> sorry, should have been: "that's what the game spec says"
2011-12-18T00:41:41  <Antimony> that bit of the game spec is a legacy from when it was actually possible in teh beta, apaprently
2011-12-18T00:42:07  <BenJackson> what's the resolution order?  is eat before combat?
2011-12-18T00:42:24  <ChrisH_> no, move, combat, eat, spawn I believe
2011-12-18T00:42:37  <Antimony> yeah
2011-12-18T00:42:48  <ChrisH_>     * move (execute orders)     * attack     * raze hills     * spawn ants     * gather food     * spawn food
2011-12-18T00:43:53  <ChrisH_> the game spec is also written that way because it isn't assuming the attackradius2 and spawnradius2 have any specific values.
2011-12-18T00:43:59  <ChrisH_> and neither does my code
2011-12-18T00:44:19  <ChrisH_> so if the spawnradius was bigger and the attack radius smaller then it could happen
2011-12-18T00:44:34  <BenJackson> mine doesn't other than nonlinearities in things like combat size would make it blow up if you made combat radius bigger
2011-12-18T00:44:48  <Antimony> ok, hopefully I got rid of all the bugs in my bot
2011-12-18T00:44:52  <Antimony> time to make new ones!
2011-12-18T00:44:53  <BenJackson> actually I don't allow for spawnradius -- is that the food eat distance?
2011-12-18T00:44:58  <ChrisH_> yes
2011-12-18T00:45:13  <Antimony> I ignore spawn rad too
2011-12-18T00:45:15  <ChrisH_> got that name back before hills were introduced
2011-12-18T00:45:41  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: has spawn control done anything amazing lately?
2011-12-18T00:45:42  <ChrisH_> I already had my base code written that way during beta, so I had no reason to change it
2011-12-18T00:45:52  <ChrisH_> hmmm, let me look
2011-12-18T00:46:39  <antimatroid> is that timer on the home page correct?
2011-12-18T00:46:56  <antimatroid> i thought there was less time than that
2011-12-18T00:47:01  <BenJackson> yes
2011-12-18T00:47:11  <ChrisH_> well, this is my most recent multi-hill on main, and it is a negative case for spawn control (as I have done it) I think:  but it could just be because I was fighting xathis:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=258985&user=10
2011-12-18T00:47:19  <ChrisH_> and the hills were so evenly distributed
2011-12-18T00:48:39  <BenJackson> also a case where low food maps are that much more sensitive to initial moves
2011-12-18T00:48:47  <ChrisH_> and here is another one where I didn't do so well: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=258370&user=10  (remember that map BenJackson?)
2011-12-18T00:49:27  <BenJackson> I used to say those maps were totally random
2011-12-18T00:49:33  <BenJackson> you convinced me that there's a strategy
2011-12-18T00:49:45  <Antimony> I still say they're totally random
2011-12-18T00:49:52  <BenJackson> but all it has to do is increase your percentage
2011-12-18T00:49:55  <antimatroid> multi hill maps?
2011-12-18T00:50:03  <antimatroid> i hate maps where ants start too close together
2011-12-18T00:50:03  <BenJackson> you're not always going to beat the guy who starts with the weak neighbor
2011-12-18T00:50:07  <antimatroid> my bot isn't great at those
2011-12-18T00:50:38  <BenJackson> lazarant does not look elegant but it wins
2011-12-18T00:51:28  <ChrisH_> yeah, but here's the thing, all of those games were with my V9 which had a change in it that I have since reverted because I think it was making my bot worse, so we'll see when V10 gets playing better opponents if I was right.
2011-12-18T00:51:29  <antimatroid> how far do you protest your hills from?
2011-12-18T00:51:39  <antimatroid> i'm just trying to max path of current turn
2011-12-18T00:52:01  <ChrisH_> Yeah, I don't understand lazarant, but it does well.
2011-12-18T00:53:24  <BenJackson> maybe 16 more games before the deadline
2011-12-18T00:53:34  <BenJackson> I guess they won't reset until they're ready for the finals
2011-12-18T00:53:39  <BenJackson> janzert: what say you
2011-12-18T00:55:44  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I'm trying mtr tcpants.com and I get nothing.
2011-12-18T00:56:08  <BenJackson> huh, works for me
2011-12-18T00:56:40  <ChrisH_> maybe because I'm running in a VM, because mtr shows my box's IP as 0.0.0.0
2011-12-18T00:56:57  <BenJackson> oh, yeah, raw sockets through a vm bridge might not work
2011-12-18T00:57:02  <BenJackson> are you bridging or nating the vm?
2011-12-18T00:57:11  <ChrisH_> let me check
2011-12-18T00:57:36  <ChrisH_> looks like NAT, which is probably the problem
2011-12-18T00:59:20  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: Did you see this game from tcpants?  http://tcpants.com/replay.3627  Love the map.  ;)
2011-12-18T01:00:49  <BenJackson> oh god did I lose on the tutorial?

2011-12-18T01:14:23  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I don't think I will timeout on the TCP servers (due to my code) anymore.
2011-12-18T01:15:22  <BenJackson> how much memory do you use?
2011-12-18T01:16:01  <BenJackson> mine only uses like 5M
2011-12-18T01:16:24  <ChrisH_> well, that depends on how big the combats get.  but right now the game I'm in is using 102M
2011-12-18T01:16:47  <ChrisH_> but keep in mind I am using a language with a GC, so I don't have as much control over memory.
2011-12-18T01:16:47  <BenJackson> that must be a tiny vm

2011-12-18T01:17:33  <antimatroid> my state can be over 100mb if the grid is large enough
2011-12-18T01:17:38  <ChrisH_> It's only got 1G of RAM, and due to other stuff on the machine my bot runs out of memory if it tries to use more than about 500M
2011-12-18T01:18:24  <ChrisH_> and since Go has a simple mark and sweep GC, that means I probably am only using 250M when that happens
2011-12-18T01:19:17  <BenJackson> has this challenge influenced your opinion of Go?
2011-12-18T01:19:52  <ChrisH_> yes, because I had to actually code in it more than before.
2011-12-18T01:20:31  <ChrisH_> and the performance tuning aspect was both easy to do because of the nice profiler they have, but also surprising what was slow
2011-12-18T01:21:32  <ChrisH_> but assuming the compilers and GC get improved over time, just talking about the language itself, I like a lot of things about it.
2011-12-18T01:21:44  <ChrisH_> It has a few annoyances that aren't too bad overall
2011-12-18T01:21:57  <ChrisH_> it needs more good libraries
2011-12-18T01:22:01  <ChrisH_> (duh, new language)
2011-12-18T01:22:40  <antimatroid> are others stealing chris h's multi hill idea?
2011-12-18T01:22:40  <BenJackson> maybe I'll try it for the next challenge
2011-12-18T01:22:57  <BenJackson> I was tempted
2011-12-18T01:23:07  <BenJackson> then I realized a big part of my multi-hill bug was my exploration code
2011-12-18T01:23:07  <ChrisH_> and I'm not sure I'm completely sold on interfaces in the language, but I still have a bunch to learn there because I haven't used them much

2011-12-18T01:23:38  <_flag> What multi hill idea?
2011-12-18T01:23:40  <BenJackson> one of my attempts to avoid indecisive ants made a change to the bfs from the explore frontier so it only propagates toward my hills
2011-12-18T01:23:43  <ChrisH_> but Go has been a lot more productive for this contest than Java was for PW.
2011-12-18T01:23:55  <BenJackson> some maps then have voids where no exploration path reaches
2011-12-18T01:24:01  <antimatroid> _flag: piss off :P your bot's already good enough
2011-12-18T01:24:04  <BenJackson> so last night I finally switched to using cost rather than passability for that
2011-12-18T01:24:11  <BenJackson> which I had implemented some time ago but forgot to use
2011-12-18T01:24:15  <_flag> antimatroid: Don't you want xathis to lose? :(
2011-12-18T01:24:18  <Antimony> the tutorial map does not meet specifications. My symmetry code would have an aneurism.
2011-12-18T01:24:36  <antimatroid> i don't mind who wins :)
2011-12-18T01:24:56  <_flag> Is it by any chance the idea that you can cover up hills in order to redirect ants?
2011-12-18T01:25:01  <BenJackson> Antimony: you sure?
2011-12-18T01:25:08  <BenJackson> _flag: yes
2011-12-18T01:25:14  <antimatroid> _flag: yes
2011-12-18T01:25:18  <antimatroid> woah, way too slow
2011-12-18T01:25:23  <_flag> Oh, I tried that a while ago and decided I didn't really get anything out of it
2011-12-18T01:25:33  <Antimony> the tutorial map is too small. it should have a min area of 1800
2011-12-18T01:26:13  <_flag> You either spend too much time trying to save a hill that's doomed because it's surrounded, or you waste ants that are sitting around on hives
2011-12-18T01:26:30  <_flag> If used right it could be really powerful, but it's really difficult to use right imo

2011-12-18T01:28:03  <Antimony> my pathing is dumb
2011-12-18T01:28:17  <antimatroid> do you guys try to collect uncontested food with ants closer to your hills/
2011-12-18T01:28:19  <ChrisH_> here is a decent example of my bot using it on tcpants:  http://tcpants.com/replay.3700
2011-12-18T01:28:24  <_flag> To be fair though, I just lost a multi hill game to Chris on tcpants, so I'll grant that it at least works a bit :)
2011-12-18T01:28:29  <antimatroid> so the starting ants can actually go out and explore?

2011-12-18T01:29:50  <ChrisH_> _flag: I agree, it has to be done right, and it took me a while to figure out how to use it effectively, but I am pretty sure it helps more ofthen than not, so I'm keeping it.
2011-12-18T01:30:19  <xyxan> any admin here???
2011-12-18T01:30:27  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I noticed it has some of the benefits my old static defense had on multi-hill mazes
2011-12-18T01:30:27  <ChrisH_> It might be my only advantage over the top bots with combat better than mine.
2011-12-18T01:30:33  <_flag> ChrisH_: Okay, sounds good to me. Maybe I'll try to renable mine and see if it isn't detrimental
2011-12-18T01:30:35  <BenJackson> since often 1 ant is enough to defend a hill for quite a while

2011-12-18T01:31:13  <ChrisH_> especially early in the game, but the advantage is that you can put more ants on the spot quickly if you need them (and there is food to be had)
2011-12-18T01:31:14  <Antimony> static defences are dumb

2011-12-18T01:32:25  <_flag> ChrisH_: How do you decide when an ant is more useful out exploring rather than sitting on a hill? That was my biggest problem, because early game I felt that every ant counted, and late game the redirection thing wasn't as big of a deal
2011-12-18T01:32:37  <xyxan> Next game should be any time now - 2 players ahead
2011-12-18T01:32:38  <BenJackson> xyxan: at the top of the page it will say how long until you play
2011-12-18T01:32:43  <xyxan> since last 30 mins
2011-12-18T01:32:56  <BenJackson> are there servers up?  check server stats (link at very bottom left)

2011-12-18T01:38:41  <BenJackson> my game finished.  bad news is it wasn't a good game for me
2011-12-18T01:38:45  <BenJackson> so games ARE playign
2011-12-18T01:39:10  <BenJackson> the end of that game is crazy, too.  teapotahedron dominated but too late to take points
2011-12-18T01:39:45  <antimatroid> "dominated but too late to take points", story of my bots life
2011-12-18T01:40:13  <BenJackson> game rate is down, though, if it's really going to be 120m to my next
2011-12-18T01:40:28  <antimatroid> i'm readjusting my hopes to top 30 again

2011-12-18T01:42:13  <BenJackson> xyxan: patience.  no admins are active right now
2011-12-18T01:42:33  <antimatroid> xyxan: you could try resubmitting in the meantime if you don't mind the version hit
2011-12-18T01:43:07  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: Game rate is 6+ games/min, which is decent, I think the time estimate you get right after you play a game is usually too conservative.
2011-12-18T01:43:09  <xyxan> ok
2011-12-18T01:43:45  <BenJackson> hard to translate 6gpm without knowing how many are in the queue
2011-12-18T01:43:47  <ChrisH_> It will probably be sooner as long as you are near active bots in the rankings.
2011-12-18T01:43:54  <antimatroid> ChrisH: within reason, too conservative is good
2011-12-18T01:43:57  <BenJackson> I always hope for a flurry of games
2011-12-18T01:44:15  <BenJackson> but I got one early in this submit so my "recent games" count is probably keeping me from being pulled into non-seeded matches
2011-12-18T01:44:17  <ChrisH_> a littel over 700 active bots right now
2011-12-18T01:44:41  <ChrisH_> I just finished a game too and I see 715 players ahead of me in the queue.

2011-12-18T02:11:15  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  meh, I think my version 18 might have been the best against a range of bots, and fixing some weaknesses might have made it more vulnerable to other bots now :-)     I was hoping for top 100, was in the 60's with v18 for a while, but can't judge now that so many more people have good combat - wish we could have a real and a 'test' version submitted at the same time :-)
2011-12-18T02:12:17  <TL_> my latest combat code makes my bot afraid to kill a single ant. had some collision problems also. wish to fix this in the next 20 hours: http://tcpants.com/replay.3735
2011-12-18T02:12:34  <Zaphus> against my own older versions, the latest is about 8% better, wins 8 more games per 100 than the other versions
2011-12-18T02:12:49  <Zaphus> actually thats 10% better, wins 88/100 compared to 80/100

2011-12-18T02:34:26  <Zaphus> just spotted a bug in my current version (been there a while):  In combat situations, if a food spawns next to a combat ant, it may try to move there but it will be stopped by the system, then another ant may suicide on to the one that failed to move...

2011-12-18T02:36:55  <a1k0n> it doesn't know it's not supposed to step on occupied hills for one
2011-12-18T02:39:17  <a1k0n> Zaphus: yeah i got bitten by that "food is impassible" thing before too
2011-12-18T02:39:54  <ChrisH_> a1k0n: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=247705&user=432
2011-12-18T02:40:25  <a1k0n> wtf?  oops
2011-12-18T02:40:44  <ChrisH_> pretty bad outcome from that bug. it has to do with not wanting to step on your own hill and having food on the opposite side, or something like that perhaps
2011-12-18T02:40:47  <a1k0n> yeah that definitely shouldn't have happened
2011-12-18T02:41:08  <a1k0n> there's not even food there though
2011-12-18T02:41:22  <a1k0n> the ant that wandered off to the right should have 1-1d your attacker
2011-12-18T02:41:23  <ChrisH_> but you do move out of there later in the game when an enemy ant gets nearby, so it may not be what I thought
2011-12-18T02:41:25  <a1k0n> er memetix's
2011-12-18T02:41:37  <a1k0n> ohh
2011-12-18T02:41:46  <a1k0n> somehow i missed the obvious bug there
2011-12-18T02:42:10  <a1k0n> yep, didn't want to step on the hill to get to the food, plus the arrangement of food created a bad local minima
2011-12-18T02:42:21  <a1k0n> i added a thing to tiebreak to keep it from standing still
2011-12-18T02:42:25  <ChrisH_> yeah, that's what i thought it might be
2011-12-18T02:42:39  <a1k0n> as soon as one of the food is eaten it breaks it
2011-12-18T02:42:56  <a1k0n> yeah, i don't plan, well, anything.  my ants are hill climbing a scoring function.
2011-12-18T02:43:54  <a1k0n> i was going to do a little brute-force best-food planner for each ant instead but never got around to it.  oh well.
2011-12-18T02:44:34  <a1k0n> still, what the hell.  my ants weren't supposed to wander away from the base either.

2011-12-18T03:32:02  <Kettling> My guys will slog through the hard yards bashing up the guards around some other guy's hill and a sneaky third player will send in a single ant to snatch the hill at the last minute
2011-12-18T03:32:26  <Zaphus> I plan on being that sneaky player, less bloodshed

2011-12-18T03:38:30  <Belerafon> It is strange, but under linux my bot run about 3 times faster then on windows

2011-12-18T03:40:30  <Belerafon> I do not check versions... I think v.3.something
2011-12-18T03:41:48  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: yes, of course.
2011-12-18T03:42:22  <UncleVasya> I'll ask my friend who has my exe-s upload them somewhere (still have crappy connection).
2011-12-18T03:42:58  <janzert> hmm, it always worries me when I see new people who have uploaded and then immediately deactivated their bot

2011-12-18T04:03:22  <UncleVasya> it's agains rules 20 hours more
2011-12-18T04:03:28  <UncleVasya> *against
2011-12-18T04:04:19  <Zaphus> Impressive, on a simple 2 player test your bot rips mine to shreds in ~150 moves, every time :-)
2011-12-18T04:05:20  <Zaphus> I know my bots main weakness, which means it does pretty good on maze maps but not so much on the open ones, and open ones seem to be happening more often now (2 players) which is a pity !
2011-12-18T04:06:31  <Zaphus> and at this point there's nothing I can do about it, I wouldnt get enough testing done to make it worth the risk
2011-12-18T04:08:04  <BenJackson> wise
2011-12-18T04:08:55  <Zaphus> I have one last change - a fix for a bug that costs me 2 ants once in a while (bad move) - not even sure if I'm game to upload that, will watch how I do on tcpants over the next few hours
2011-12-18T04:10:27  <Zaphus> I wish someone would come up with a unit-test framework so we could feed in situations and somehow check if our bot behaves right (e.g. map with no food and 2 ants at the start, can properly wipe out other single ant colonies without suicide or standoff)
2011-12-18T04:10:40  <BenJackson> you can do that
2011-12-18T04:10:41  <BenJackson> I do
2011-12-18T04:10:55  <BenJackson> make a .map (they're trivial) and run playgame with --scenario and --food none
2011-12-18T04:11:01  <Zaphus> can, perhaps... did I do it, no :-)
2011-12-18T04:12:53  <Kettling> Yeah plays over ssh just fine... if anyone sends me a public key (and the IP address they are coming from) I can open up network access to my bot. You have to set "--loadtime 10000" because of the slow ssh handshake, and overall the game is a bit laggy
2011-12-18T04:13:10  <BenJackson> oh that's an interesting way to do it
2011-12-18T04:13:16  <BenJackson> I was thinking about putting something like that up earlier in the contest
2011-12-18T04:13:37  <BenJackson> you could probably just put MyBot right in inetd if you were trusting
2011-12-18T04:13:48  <Zaphus> I suppose you can also do things like a map with pre-seeded food and check that you get to an particular number of ants by a particular turn
2011-12-18T04:13:51  <BenJackson> just using a dummy account with ssh is a better idea
2011-12-18T04:13:59  <BenJackson> Zaphus: I've also done that
2011-12-18T04:14:08  <BenJackson> to quickly iterate on exploration
2011-12-18T04:14:22  <BenJackson> I made a --forever option so when my bot kills "holdbot" it keeps running
2011-12-18T04:15:01  <Kettling> Yeah, I created an aichallenge account and use command="/home/aichallenge/ants/MyBot" in front of the line in /home/aichallenge/.ssh/authorized_keys
2011-12-18T04:15:35  <Kettling> should be plausibly safe
2011-12-18T04:16:23  <BenJackson> not seen a 3-player stalemate work out quite like this:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=265672&user=3473
2011-12-18T04:16:25  <Zaphus> BenJackson: I guess that's why you're a top 20-ish bot and I'm not :-)  next time for sure!
2011-12-18T04:16:43  <BenJackson> me, xathis, flag, largely a stalemate except I give one (of two) hills to flag which determines the entire outcome
2011-12-18T04:17:23  <BenJackson> Kettling: it's a good idea.  I would have opened something like that up early in the contest if I'd thought of it

2011-12-18T04:18:10  <Kettling> Seem incompatible with ssh-agent for some reason, probably they strip away the environment vars *shrug* just generate a new key for this particular purpose and don't put a password on the key. Throw it away after
2011-12-18T04:18:52  <Kettling> Well I've got one open now... I could do with some last minute training sessions

2011-12-18T04:37:00  <Kettling> Might help with the obvious stuff... has anyone seen the attackrange variable change?
2011-12-18T04:38:01  <BenJackson> it won't
2011-12-18T04:38:20  <BenJackson> they're variable because there was a beta/tuning phase, but they haven't changed since the contest started
2011-12-18T04:38:23  <BenJackson> and won't change in the finals
2011-12-18T04:38:41  <BenJackson> Kettling: I considered similar ideas before I had combat
2011-12-18T04:38:54  <BenJackson> I sketched a lot of things out and counted it up
2011-12-18T04:38:59  <BenJackson> there are a lot of configurations
2011-12-18T04:39:06  <BenJackson> like 2^80 even with rotational symmetry
2011-12-18T04:39:53  <Kettling> Yeah well it doesn't need to do a perfect job, just avoid total blunders
2011-12-18T04:40:26  <BenJackson> the memetix combat description in the forum would be good for 'avoid blunders'
2011-12-18T04:40:40  <BenJackson> he basically describes how to identify all the dangerous/non dangerous squares
2011-12-18T04:40:50  <BenJackson> but he didn't say how you should use the info
2011-12-18T04:41:06  <Kettling> Also, if the ants know a few good moves, they will be attracted toward those moves (like a three in a wall, etc) which probably gets you out of trouble 80% of the time

2011-12-18T05:42:31  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: You still need to have 'Bot' in your bot name :D
2011-12-18T05:42:35  <Zaphus> trying 4-player test, 22_2_5 vs my last 3 versions - one of mine won the first battle, but it was 3 v 1 kind of :-)
2011-12-18T05:45:13  <Zaphus> 20 minutes until my next game, I might just upload the latest code to get that one extra game for comparison.  I can revert in 12h if I think it was a mistake

2011-12-18T05:53:50  <Zaphus> lol
2011-12-18T05:54:05  <UncleVasya> At least vs 22_1
2011-12-18T05:54:20  <UncleVasya> Because 22_1 hates big battles
2011-12-18T05:54:40  <Zaphus> in my 4 player tests, my latest bot has won 3 of them, and 22_2_5 won 1 (and my other two have not won a match, only 4 so far)

2011-12-18T06:11:26  * janzert cries
2011-12-18T06:11:47  <Murashka> yep and hard decision waiting for us
2011-12-18T06:11:50  <Kettling> So how's this for a cheap and cheesy battle algorithm? I already have a map giving the number of steps to the nearest enemy (Manhattan style) so suppose I just made a move (let's ignore why I made that move) and then I have 8 squares around me, I subtract away
2011-12-18T06:12:00  <janzert> I just discovered an error in my cost calculation spreadsheet
2011-12-18T06:12:13  <Kettling> the square I move to and just consider "+" or "0" or "-" for the 8 squares around me.
2011-12-18T06:12:20  <antimatroid> janzert: isn't it good that this is noticed now rather than later? :P
2011-12-18T06:12:21  <Zaphus> you have a "cost calculation spreadsheet" ?
2011-12-18T06:12:28  <antimatroid> janzert: did you see the comments about match making?
2011-12-18T06:12:37  <Kettling> That's less than 7000 possible values... fine for a LUT.
2011-12-18T06:12:39  <janzert> the good news is we'll have lots of workers available for the finals, the bad news we could have had a couple more workers running for the last week or so
2011-12-18T06:13:09  <antimatroid> :)
2011-12-18T06:13:39  <janzert> I think I saw the only match making problem discussion

2011-12-18T06:39:23  <antimatroid> it's always quite lonely for the aussies
2011-12-18T06:39:39  <Zaphus> I'm intrigued to see how the new pairing cutoff code works... I see it got updated earlier today, I hope it's been properly tested!
2011-12-18T06:40:27  <antimatroid> we had no top 100 in tron, and 2 top 100 in planet wars
2011-12-18T06:40:37  <antimatroid> although i still claim i should have had top 10 in tron :P
2011-12-18T06:41:13  <Zaphus> I could have been in the top 100 in planet wars, but lost my job right in the middle and wasnt in the mood to finish it, was doing OK up until then  (job stuff worked out OK in the end though)
2011-12-18T06:41:38  <antimatroid> oh man, how can we convince like 50 people to enter the contest in under a day?
2011-12-18T06:41:44  <antimatroid> we're that close to 8000 submissions
2011-12-18T06:42:24  <antimatroid> we should inspire redditors to do the 17 hour challenge :P under an organisation name that they can rank themselves with
2011-12-18T06:42:50  <Zaphus> lol, you'd get 50 if you tried it
2011-12-18T06:43:31  <antimatroid> very unlikely
2011-12-18T06:43:42  <Zaphus> I wish they would scrap the 2-player maps, this contest is all about multiplayer maps and 2 just isnt as interesting...  plus my bot sucks at them :-)
2011-12-18T06:43:51  <antimatroid> no, i like the 2 player maps :P
2011-12-18T06:44:09  <Zaphus> I like 4 player maze maps, thats all I've tested on !

2011-12-18T06:46:08  <Zaphus> yeah, me too... my game is still running though
2011-12-18T06:46:27  <antimatroid> i wonder if it's against me
2011-12-18T06:46:41  <antimatroid> i have lots of ants, but i don't think i started out well
2011-12-18T06:46:58  <antimatroid> but there's a game from before that i think i did badly in
2011-12-18T06:47:00  <antimatroid> i want to see why
2011-12-18T06:47:39  <Kettling> Hey, now I look at combat closely... I don't quite get it, in as much as moves don't seem to be evaluated simultaneously
2011-12-18T06:48:16  <antimatroid> Kettling: what do you mean?
2011-12-18T06:48:19  <UncleVasya> Zaphus:  '3 days in a locked room with infinite red bull'  <-- this is the way to make at least some entry to the ICFPC. And 2-3 friends in your team to make your entry do something.
2011-12-18T06:48:32  <Zaphus> hey, here's a 'trick' for the TCP servers - at the end of the turn put   "# comment about turn" in your output, the server ignores it and it gets repeated on your console output
2011-12-18T06:48:46  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: it's always on when i have exams :(
2011-12-18T06:48:50  <antimatroid> wond be a problem in the future though
2011-12-18T06:48:53  <antimatroid> wont*
2011-12-18T06:49:18  <Kettling> So for example, if one ant steps in, and the other and steps off to one side then (by simultaneous move) the one that steps to one side was never in the attack radius, but anyhow combat is triggered
2011-12-18T06:49:50  <antimatroid> Kettling: check the attack radius :P
2011-12-18T06:49:52  <antimatroid> it's 5
2011-12-18T06:50:06  <UncleVasya> I've read tasks for few of them. I think no way I can make something with it. Very advanced for me :(
2011-12-18T06:50:11  <antimatroid> or sqrt(5) depending on your metric
2011-12-18T06:51:18  <antimatroid> damnit, i want to see games
2011-12-18T06:52:07  <Zaphus> 24 servers on the main contest site now, game times coming down again - I might get 4 more games in before breakfast :-)
2011-12-18T06:52:56  <antimatroid> i wonder if anyone else has a last minute main site entry like me
2011-12-18T06:53:23  <pairofdice> Probably not at the rate I'm managing to fail
2011-12-18T06:54:12  <Zaphus> antimatroid: you mean a 'better than the starter bot' entry ?  I'd guess you're almost alone out there

2011-12-18T06:54:59  <antimatroid> they're still on their first version
2011-12-18T06:55:27  <pairofdice> Over a month to when I last looked at this code
2011-12-18T06:55:33  <Zaphus> I think Momo will fall in the final rankings, Trueskill seems to hold you up high once you have enough games under your belt
2011-12-18T06:55:45  <Kettling> Yeah, I'm single stepping through historic combats in the visualizer... I have ant at (41,41) who moves w to (41,40) and I have enemy at (43,38) who moves s to (44,38) and in the first position the r^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 11, in the second position the r^2 = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 11
2011-12-18T06:56:02  <Kettling> The second move shows a combat linkage in the visualizer and they both die
2011-12-18T06:57:14  <antimatroid> Zaphus: i think tcpants is actually down now
2011-12-18T06:57:36  <Zaphus> well, the last game mine was in ended on turn 666 - an omen perhaps ?
2011-12-18T06:58:08  <Kettling> If you presume that "attackradius2":actually goes with what the docs say then they should not be in combat at all, but even on a longer attackradius the distance did not change (unless the advancing ant moved first)
2011-12-18T06:58:24  <janzert> Kettling: hit step forward again in the visualizer, they should be moving into the attack radius on the turn the linkage is shown
2011-12-18T06:58:45  <pairofdice> Don't use your keyboard
2011-12-18T06:59:15  <BenJackson> janzert: when will the reset be?
2011-12-18T06:59:19  <BenJackson> are you guys ready to go right at 0-hour?
2011-12-18T06:59:42  <Zaphus> Kettling:  the visualiser does two updates per turn, the linkage shows up before the move happens
2011-12-18T06:59:55  <janzert> BenJackson: submissions will close at 0-hour, it will take me some time to get everything setup and ready to start the finals
2011-12-18T07:00:10  <BenJackson> Kettling: this confuses some people because keyboard arrow keys go turn-at-a-time but the screen buttons go half
2011-12-18T07:00:19  <janzert> last year it was about 3 hours, I expect it could be somewhere around the same this year
2011-12-18T07:00:35  <BenJackson> so maybe a couple extra games under the old regime
2011-12-18T07:00:52  <BenJackson> wow, ai-class textbook prices just plummeted
2011-12-18T07:00:55  <BenJackson> muahaha
2011-12-18T07:00:57  <janzert> there will be some games played after submissions actually close yes
2011-12-18T07:00:58  <Zaphus> janzert: Has the format for the finals been decided ?  (maps, map sizes, number of games, etc)
2011-12-18T07:01:08  <BenJackson> down from about $105 a few days ago to $75-80
2011-12-18T07:01:36  <pairofdice> heh
2011-12-18T07:01:55  <janzert> maps will be from the same generators as are currently in the repo, which I believe are the same as what are currently running on the server except for maybe I think amstan added another one
2011-12-18T07:02:15  <janzert> I'm not really happy about that either so don't complain to me ;)
2011-12-18T07:02:34  <janzert> the brand spanking new map type that will only appear in the finals that is

2011-12-18T07:03:18  <Zaphus> yeah, I know, just echoing :-)
2011-12-18T07:03:35  <BenJackson> janzert: ChrisH pasted me a tcpants game where I lost to him on the tutorial map
2011-12-18T07:03:38  <BenJackson> which is apparently in that rotation
2011-12-18T07:03:42  <janzert> hehe
2011-12-18T07:03:47  <BenJackson> so my nightmare scenario is FINALS ALL TUTORIAL MAP
2011-12-18T07:03:51  <pairofdice> I would like a maptype tailored for my stupidBot
2011-12-18T07:04:03  <Zaphus> strikes me as something that amstan/etc thinks would be 'fun' but isn't thinking about the thousands of people who would disagree :-)
2011-12-18T07:04:17  <BenJackson> it would be "fun" to see on the side
2011-12-18T07:04:21  <janzert> well finals hasn't started yet so... ;)
2011-12-18T07:04:40  <BenJackson> janzert: ballpark how many games the top 10-100 will play in finals?
2011-12-18T07:05:05  <BenJackson> or I guess: how long with the final mu cutoff phase be and how many bots will it take?
2011-12-18T07:05:10  <janzert> this is pretty much a WAG, but around 200
2011-12-18T07:05:19  <BenJackson> cool
2011-12-18T07:05:21  <Zaphus> 200 would be awesome
2011-12-18T07:05:45  *** nha <nha!~prefect@5-74.104-92.cust.bluewin.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-18T07:05:47  <Zaphus> does the pairing cutoff use mu or skill ?
2011-12-18T07:05:55  <janzert> rank
2011-12-18T07:06:10  <Zaphus> oh, just drop the bottom X each time it tightens the group ?
2011-12-18T07:06:55  <janzert> pretty much, the cutoff will adjust smoothly over a given time period (usually several hours) when it is adjusted
2011-12-18T07:07:22  <Kettling> Oh I see, those guys stepped towards each other, but the keyboard single-stepper just deleted them. It shows the pre-combat, not the actual combat. Yeah... that's confusing. Now you explained it, less so
2011-12-18T07:07:27  <BenJackson> hm, so top 100-200 could play 200 games (together) in a day
2011-12-18T07:07:32  <BenJackson> seems reasonable
2011-12-18T07:07:56  <janzert> the bottom bots will probably play 15-20 games btw
2011-12-18T07:07:57  <BenJackson> Kettling: it's possible that the keyboard full steps will go from half step to half step if you start from a half step
2011-12-18T07:08:01  <BenJackson> I've always found it confusing
2011-12-18T07:08:30  <Zaphus> The finals go for ~1 week, so you could just drop the last placed person every minute, after they've reached the minimum games :-)
2011-12-18T07:08:57  <janzert> anyway time to take a few hours of sleep again, later
2011-12-18T07:08:58  <BenJackson> the cutoff is not by person
2011-12-18T07:09:05  <BenJackson> it's by skill (or mu)
2011-12-18T07:09:11  <janzert> BenJackson: no it's not
2011-12-18T07:09:12  <BenJackson> so you can have people go in or out at the bottom
2011-12-18T07:09:25  <janzert> it's by rank but you can still go in and out of course
2011-12-18T07:09:32  <Zaphus> it's going to suck if you draw Xathis+Flag+Memetix in your first round though :-)
2011-12-18T07:09:34  <BenJackson> rank = skill, so ok
2011-12-18T07:09:41  <BenJackson> I see what you mean, though

2011-12-18T07:09:45  <BenJackson> skill indirected through rank
2011-12-18T07:09:49  <Kettling> Na, it's OK. The tools are actually very impressive. It's just learning to drive them.
2011-12-18T07:09:50  <BenJackson> but not a cutoff where you missed it and you're out
2011-12-18T07:09:51  <janzert> yeah, for that it is completely equivalent
2011-12-18T07:10:15  <Zaphus> oh, so if you are on the border and a few above lose their games, you might get another game
2011-12-18T07:10:27  <BenJackson> zaphus: funny my second to last game was with flag and xathis
2011-12-18T07:10:30  <BenJackson> lost that
2011-12-18T07:10:31  * janzert nods
2011-12-18T07:10:38  <BenJackson> game before was with memetix, cumbuz, pguillory, greentea
2011-12-18T07:10:40  <BenJackson> won that
2011-12-18T07:10:44  <BenJackson> so, yay
2011-12-18T07:10:57  <BenJackson> sadly tea timed out but I don't think it affected other players that much
2011-12-18T07:11:19  <Zaphus> BenJackson: nicely done, are you hoping for a top 10 finish ?
2011-12-18T07:11:24  <BenJackson> hoping
2011-12-18T07:11:41  <BenJackson> seems plausible based on some individual games and aggregate tcpants results
2011-12-18T07:11:56  <BenJackson> but I've been resubmitting without stabilizing the last few times
2011-12-18T07:12:13  <Zaphus> I'm aiming for 99th place :-)
2011-12-18T07:12:18  <BenJackson> the top 10 has a serious stratification
2011-12-18T07:12:31  <BenJackson> xathis, then about 4 people close to each other but with a gap
2011-12-18T07:12:38  <BenJackson> but then out to about 15th it's close again
2011-12-18T07:12:52  <BenJackson> I *think* I'm about between the top 5-6 and the pack behind that out to 15
2011-12-18T07:12:54  <BenJackson> but we'll see
2011-12-18T07:12:55  <Zaphus> wish someone would kick the tcpants webserver and get it running again!
2011-12-18T07:13:03  <BenJackson> it's playing games!
2011-12-18T07:13:23  <Zaphus> yes, but you can't see the results
2011-12-18T07:13:33  <BenJackson> you can see each game's results if you see it scroll by :)
2011-12-18T07:13:43  <BenJackson> knowing what I do now I'd log all the info from the server so I could have it
2011-12-18T07:13:48  <Zaphus> you cant tell if you won or not, just how many points you finished with
2011-12-18T07:13:57  <Belerafon> tcpants.com is down?
2011-12-18T07:14:06  <BenJackson> not the games, but the web front
2011-12-18T07:14:15  <Zaphus> I modified my tcp script to show the game count in the title bar, would add win/loss if I could see that too

2011-12-18T07:14:31  <BenJackson> janzert: would it be ok to post a wanted ad for the ai-class book on the forums?
2011-12-18T07:15:41  <Zaphus> Anyone know the difference between C++ and C++11 - any performance benefits ? or just the new language stuff
2011-12-18T07:16:44  <artart78> new stuff
2011-12-18T07:16:53  <artart78> it's just a programming language specification
2011-12-18T07:17:04  <artart78> the specification doesn't contain how the compiler should interpret / compile things
2011-12-18T07:17:21  <artart78> so it can't have performance benefits; those depend on the compiler
2011-12-18T07:17:23  <Zaphus> meh, so it's a fair bet the compiler is no better and probably a little less optimised
2011-12-18T07:17:29  <Zaphus> simply because it's new
2011-12-18T07:17:39  <BenJackson> it can have performance benefits
2011-12-18T07:17:47  <BenJackson> because the spec has been changed to clarify cases that can now be optimized
2011-12-18T07:18:01  <artart78> oh, yeah, true
2011-12-18T07:18:13  <Zaphus> not that it really matters - I'm not about to resubmit to pick up the language, but maybe for next year :-)
2011-12-18T07:18:15  <artart78> but some new things are really slow
2011-12-18T07:18:34  <BenJackson> thestinger has strong opinions on c++11 for this contest
2011-12-18T07:18:38  <BenJackson> largely pro
2011-12-18T07:18:58  <BenJackson> he'll be #1 for that "language" so I was suggesting I should switch from c++ at the last minute

2011-12-18T07:22:03  <Zaphus> I've spotted it 3 times already hence the fix

2011-12-18T08:27:08  <smiley1983> The last sentence referred to mine
2011-12-18T08:27:35  <antimatroid> you might know me as testbot
2011-12-18T08:27:51  <smiley1983> antimatroid: Ah, I had wondered which was you :)
2011-12-18T08:28:04  <antimatroid> i'm trying to improve the ants general movement
2011-12-18T08:28:11  <antimatroid> they get too caught up going back and forth
2011-12-18T08:28:26  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: Can this crasy staff lead to timeout? http://pastebin.com/qvpqqLak
2011-12-18T08:29:27  <smiley1983> Mine also sometimes get stuck in loops where they keep swapping objectives, and so two ants oscillate until another comes and breaks the cycle
2011-12-18T08:30:02  <antimatroid> hmmm, interesting idea
2011-12-18T08:30:07  <UncleVasya> *stuff
2011-12-18T08:30:19  <antimatroid> if you wanted to place bets with people on who ranks highest, odds should be previously rankings
2011-12-18T08:30:33  <antimatroid> previous* for past contests
2011-12-18T08:30:39  <smiley1983> antimatroid: I remember testbot as being strong :)

2011-12-18T08:33:07  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: depends how long those lists are. You've got two List.exists nested inside a List.filter, so it'll time out on very long lists
2011-12-18T08:33:32  <UncleVasya> define very long
2011-12-18T08:34:07  <smiley1983> However, they're fast operations, and I generally find that nested to a depth of 2 (rather than 3) they take 2-3 milliseconds for the longest lists I generate in my bot
2011-12-18T08:34:17  <smiley1983> haha, as for very long...
2011-12-18T08:34:34  <UncleVasya> ok, so this is not the reason thanks.
2011-12-18T08:34:48  <UncleVasya> And I have no more ideas why it times out :(
2011-12-18T08:35:06  <smiley1983> but if your list is 150 long and then you nest to a depth of three, it might take 450ms
2011-12-18T08:35:25  <smiley1983> rather than 3ms
2011-12-18T08:36:19  <smiley1983> If you put line before and after the function call which prints something to stderr, you can verify where the timeout occurs
2011-12-18T08:36:40  <UncleVasya> right!
2011-12-18T08:36:52  <smiley1983> s/put line/put a line
2011-12-18T08:37:16  <UncleVasya> I forget I can write more then 1 line inside the exists and filter functions!
2011-12-18T08:37:37  <Murashka> UncleVasya get input data from game with timeout. Launch yours bot with this data and log time before and after code with possible problem.
2011-12-18T08:38:21  <Murashka> while i'm writing smiley said the same thing.

2011-12-18T08:39:28  <smiley1983> yes, or even just have a line before and after the List.filter, since putting it inside the lambdas will repeat it for every iteration of an item in the list (which might be useful too, sometimes)
2011-12-18T08:39:56  <UncleVasya> So as this is only one place in the my code where I don't have the timecheck (The idea to insert this check inside the function never came to my mind, thank you so much!) I have no time outs anymore (I hope) :)
2011-12-18T08:41:07  <smiley1983> Best of luck!
2011-12-18T08:41:30  <UncleVasya> Murashka: thank you too. I tried to to write debug info before and after function calls but it  calls to often...
2011-12-18T08:41:42  <UncleVasya> *is called
2011-12-18T08:41:46  <smiley1983> Oh, I see, you can raise an exception on timeout within the lambda, and then it will exit the filter early - I hadn't thought of doing that :)
2011-12-18T08:41:57  <UncleVasya> heheh, few several hours left.
2011-12-18T08:42:25  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: Your caming here can be a diversion agains strong OCaml opponent...

2011-12-18T09:27:49  <Extrarius> hrmm, is it too late to get my map generator polished up and used in the finals?
2011-12-18T09:28:26  <Extrarius> it does seem kinda unfair to have map types in the finals that people couldn't practice against, but then again, that might turn out some interesting games
2011-12-18T09:28:48  <pairofdice> Makes it more interesting imo
2011-12-18T09:29:26  <pairofdice> And it's perfectly fair :>
2011-12-18T09:29:39  <xyxan> It would be much more intersting if they change parameters as well in tournament games
2011-12-18T09:29:49  <xyxan> like viewradius and attack radius :D
2011-12-18T09:30:46  <Extrarius> xyxan: It would probably be immensely detrimental to play for most bots, since from what I've heard in hear, it sounds like very few bots are using 'real' 'robust' AI algorithms
2011-12-18T09:30:58  <besh> I think attack radius will not be changed.
2011-12-18T09:31:24  <Extrarius> it'd probably lead to 99%+ timeouts if they increased attack radius
2011-12-18T09:31:26  <xyxan> yup because AI algotithms takes too much time to give results
2011-12-18T09:32:00  <Extrarius> xyxan: not if you do it in efficient C. I had planned to perfect a bot in python and then port it to C, but I moved and ran out of time so I decided to do a map generator instead
2011-12-18T09:32:38  <xyxan> yeah i coded in c++ for efficiency
2011-12-18T09:33:56  <xyxan> Do anyone know AI algorithms for partially observable adversarial environments??
2011-12-18T09:34:34  <Extrarius> xyxan: there are many algorithms for different parts of the problem. I had planned on using D* lite for pathfinding, which is a much better fit than plain A*

2011-12-18T10:00:58  <nha> ah fuck
2011-12-18T10:01:06  <nha> no, it's something else entirely
2011-12-18T10:01:13  <nha> I have several different versions of my tactical code
2011-12-18T10:01:30  <xyxan> lol ok
2011-12-18T10:01:30  <nha> and I forgot to rename one sub-class in one of the copies
2011-12-18T10:01:36  <pairofdice> This one has the "play dead" tactic
2011-12-18T10:01:44  <nha> now it looks like the linker behaves differently depending on which order the .o files are presented in

2011-12-18T10:28:41  <Extrarius> I think the winner is going to come down to whichever bot best does 'sacrifices' to take hills instead of reaching stalemate with well-guarded hills
2011-12-18T10:28:53  <matthewd> Fluxid: Looks like a soft timeout
2011-12-18T10:29:24  <Extrarius> it seems like many bots have reasonable combat code, but most will also stalemate against a wall of opponents even when equal losses would lead to a win
2011-12-18T10:29:29  <nha> Fluxid: what are you using for combat? no breaking through the enemy ants?

2011-12-18T11:51:38  <ikaros> yea i assumed that
2011-12-18T11:51:50  <ikaros> still like how your ants swarm :)
2011-12-18T11:51:54  <conor_f> its really simple really, I just had them all go to the nearest piece of food ;) more of a lucky accident
2011-12-18T11:52:02  <ikaros> ohh lol
2011-12-18T11:52:09  <conor_f> haha, yeah

2011-12-18T11:52:21  <UncleVasya> m not sure

2011-12-18T11:52:59  <conor_f> yeah, it was surprisingly effective at stopping my ants from killing themselves, instead of some complicated strategy
2011-12-18T11:53:43  <conor_f> which bot is yours btw?
2011-12-18T11:53:49  <ikaros> same name

2011-12-18T11:55:14  <conor_f> no, but wow, you've got a strong bot :O

2011-12-18T12:04:54  <conor_f> ofc QuirionPt
2011-12-18T12:05:20  <avdg> if you're good in coding (in not writing bugs) and you have a model to do it, it should be still possible
2011-12-18T12:05:23  <QuirionPt> everything else is done ! Hope it's not too buggy

2011-12-18T12:06:24  <dmj111> they close down submissions, and let the bots play for a few days.  not sure of the exact schedule this time.
2011-12-18T12:07:00  <conor_f> yeah, ok
2011-12-18T12:09:18  <avdg> hmm, the submissions are higher, but not as high as I expect
2011-12-18T12:09:49  <avdg> 730 -> still around 10% of the people who submitted a bot?
2011-12-18T12:10:14  <Garf> I just found I submitted the wrong version :P
2011-12-18T12:10:27  <avdg> :D
2011-12-18T12:10:50  <Garf> I fixed a bug in a version that was well-tested, and then went on to make several improvements that backfired
2011-12-18T12:11:04  <conor_f> bad luck Garf :/
2011-12-18T12:11:06  <Garf> when I dropped those improvements, I dropped the fix :P
2011-12-18T12:11:24  <avdg> well, lucky you, you could at least detect the error :p
2011-12-18T12:11:53  * avdg wonders how many people will upload the wrong version without realizing it until the deadline or later
2011-12-18T12:11:57  <Garf> Murphy now says that that bug was probably a positive influence :P

2011-12-18T12:43:01  <Migi32> antimatroid: take into account that on the site, your bot might run about 2x slower
2011-12-18T12:43:02  <antimatroid> Migi32: are you at about turn 320?
2011-12-18T12:43:18  <antimatroid> Migi32: i don't have an amazing computer
2011-12-18T12:43:24  <antimatroid> i'm hoping it's not that much difference
2011-12-18T12:43:31  <avdg> hmm, you can see the bots at the start right?

2011-12-18T12:51:04  <antimatroid> <3 janzert
2011-12-18T12:51:12  <mcstar> i like the design
2011-12-18T12:51:22  <Blindsniper5> When is the next challenge going to be then ?
2011-12-18T12:51:43  <mcstar> UncleVasya: did he mention any specifics?
2011-12-18T12:51:48  <UncleVasya> Blindsniper5: no such info yet
2011-12-18T12:52:00  <Blindsniper5> But what is the deadline for then ?
2011-12-18T12:52:06  <antimatroid> protocolocon resubmitted
2011-12-18T12:52:06  <Migi32> antimatroid: ok looks like we weren't in the same game after all. I'll get you next time ;)
2011-12-18T12:52:24  <mcstar> Migi32: you must be very confident
2011-12-18T12:52:29  <antimatroid> i didn't raze any hills in my game aha
2011-12-18T12:52:36  <mcstar> no submission since nov. 2nd
2011-12-18T12:52:50  <UncleVasya> Blindsniper5: after deadline you cannot resubmit. Bots will play for a few days and then it is over
2011-12-18T12:53:40  <Blindsniper5> ok, I just discovered the website yesterday and I didn't want to start if the challenge was going to end.
2011-12-18T12:54:15  <Vaenom> aside tcpants.com and fluxid.pl, any other good game server?
2011-12-18T12:54:16  <mcstar> Blindsniper5: you have time to submit a starterbot
2011-12-18T12:54:32  <UncleVasya> <UncleVasya> smiley1983: mcstar decided to learn OCaml .But few days ago re-decided and now wanna learn haskell. I said you'll come here and return him to the Way of Right by pointing out why he must learn Ocaml instead of Haskell.
2011-12-18T12:54:37  <UncleVasya> 
2011-12-18T12:54:37  <UncleVasya> <smiley1983> UncleVasya: I intend to learn haskell myself, so I can hardly tell mcstar not to :)
2011-12-18T12:54:53  <mcstar> XD
2011-12-18T12:55:32  <mcstar> i have not decided to learn ocaml the first time, i just checked it out
2011-12-18T12:55:52  <mcstar> but yeah, smiley has some good arguments against haskell
2011-12-18T12:56:16  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you are like salt to me
2011-12-18T12:56:43  <UncleVasya> salt?
2011-12-18T12:57:33  <mcstar> you know the story with the king, his son, and salt right?
2011-12-18T12:57:54  <UncleVasya> no, I don't.
2011-12-18T12:58:23  <UncleVasya> But i wish to be king or at least his son, not a salt! :D
2011-12-18T12:58:31  <mcstar> the king asked his sone how he feels about his father
2011-12-18T12:58:41  <mcstar> the son answered: you are to me like salt to you!
2011-12-18T12:58:56  <mcstar> the king banished his son, beacuse he didnt understand his answer
2011-12-18T12:59:12  <mcstar> later the son secretly told the chief not to put salt into the king's soup
2011-12-18T12:59:26  <mcstar> time passed, the king felt theres something wrong with the food
2011-12-18T12:59:37  <mcstar> his mood became worse and worse
2011-12-18T12:59:43  <mcstar> the story goes on
2011-12-18T12:59:50  <mcstar> the son comes back
2011-12-18T12:59:58  <Antimony> In the version of that I heard it was the kings daughter
2011-12-18T13:00:00  <mcstar> and tell the king: look, i told the chief to leave salt out
2011-12-18T13:00:07  <mcstar> tell->told
2011-12-18T13:00:27  <mcstar> after that, the king understood what his son meant by "you are like salt to em"
2011-12-18T13:00:30  <mcstar> or wth
2011-12-18T13:00:36  <mcstar> i dont know that story well
2011-12-18T13:00:46  <Antimony> I'm sure there are tons of versions
2011-12-18T13:01:04  <UncleVasya> so why am I like salt to you?
2011-12-18T13:01:15  <mcstar> fuck
2011-12-18T13:01:20  <mcstar> not chief, chef!
2011-12-18T13:01:35  <mcstar> i dont know, figure it out man
2011-12-18T13:02:53  <Belerafon> Who is   BuggyCode ?
2011-12-18T13:03:07  <pairofdice> salt is the most important condiment
2011-12-18T13:03:25  <NotABug> Belerafon: Not me ;)
2011-12-18T13:03:30  <mcstar> pairofdice: thx!, condiment
2011-12-18T13:04:04  <conor_f> how long would one be waiting for the first game on a fresh bot?

2011-12-18T13:10:45  <mcstar> i implemented a cluster detector and a priority system on top of them
2011-12-18T13:10:57  <antimatroid> "Server will shutdown shortly after submission deadline passes. Thanks for using this server and good luck on finals!"

2011-12-18T13:12:02  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you detect clusters of ants?
2011-12-18T13:12:14  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-12-18T13:12:30  <antimatroid> i just move ants towards battle borders
2011-12-18T13:12:46  <antimatroid> and not through them
2011-12-18T13:13:00  <mcstar> but separate battles into clusters, and i have a condition number which tells me how well i matched enemy forces

2011-12-18T13:14:19  <mcstar> i have to figure out how to make my ants very aggresive when i can overpower the enemy

2011-12-18T13:17:42  <UncleVasya> Migi32: when you have few hiils but want ants to be spawned only in one of them.
2011-12-18T13:18:13  <UncleVasya> You step on the top of hills where you don't need reinforcments
2011-12-18T13:18:31  <Migi32> ah, ok. Well, is it worth it? I mean, you have to keep an ant on top of all your other hills
2011-12-18T13:18:35  <Belerafon> maybe surround enemy hill on multihill map and eat enemy then it spawn :)
2011-12-18T13:20:13  <avdg> I think it only pays of with a small hive count or to raise the hive

2011-12-18T13:21:49  <Antimony> but ChrisH's bot is awesome. So much for that idea

2011-12-18T13:25:37  <Migi32> Antimony: most defense things I've tried turned out to be bad for me. Like always keeping a small % of your ants around each hill for defense
2011-12-18T13:26:07  <Migi32> no matter how small that %, it was always pretty much useless, and those ants are better spent exploring/fighting elsewhere
2011-12-18T13:26:08  <Antimony> I use a 5th of my ants for defence, but it often fails
2011-12-18T13:26:14  <mcstar> i have an override that pulls the closest ant back if it tries to leave my hill
2011-12-18T13:26:31  <Antimony> but my defence ants are supposed to gather and explore too
2011-12-18T13:28:18  <mcstar> prebattle, gatherer, preattacker, attacker, defender, wanderer, preattackercautious, dispatched, introuble
2011-12-18T13:28:25  <Migi32> hmm that could work. I just kept them in a very small radius (like 3 or something) around my hills
2011-12-18T13:28:26  <mcstar> thats my enum :D
2011-12-18T13:28:57  <Migi32> Dear ant: you have been assigned the task of being in trouble :p

2011-12-18T13:31:53  <Blindsniper5> When I upload code, do I need to include project files like .snl and .vbproj or do I only upload code files ?

2011-12-18T13:32:08  <avdg> I hope that number will continue to rise
2011-12-18T13:32:14  <Migi32> Blindsniper5: only upload your code files
2011-12-18T13:32:36  <antimatroid> Migi32: do you zip it in a folder or just the source files?
2011-12-18T13:32:45  <mcstar> no fulder
2011-12-18T13:32:57  <conor_f> you need to zip the version and all the other misc. stuff too...
2011-12-18T13:33:02  <Migi32> it's all explained here: http://aichallenge.org/submit.php
2011-12-18T13:33:06  <Migi32> one zip, just the source files.

2011-12-18T13:34:04  <bmh> given that my bot is destine to never run on the server, I think I'll submit a bot that just prints the text to Joyce's ulysses ;)

2011-12-18T13:56:38  <avdg> hmm, its a hard fight at the first position, now more bots are abusing weak spots
2011-12-18T13:56:43  <xathis> mcstar, conor_f: stop bashing java! :P
2011-12-18T13:56:56  <ikaros> :))
2011-12-18T13:57:07  <mcstar> xathis: im not against java, im pro some other language
2011-12-18T13:57:24  <conor_f> nah, xathis I'm impressed by your bot. you really put in a lot of effort. congrats :)
2011-12-18T13:57:28  * avdg hates almost like every language he codes in
2011-12-18T13:57:40  <mcstar> im just saying, your winning could only be topped by using a nicer language for example
2011-12-18T13:57:46  <mcstar> (purely subjective)
2011-12-18T13:57:55  <conor_f> nicer as in C btw ;)
2011-12-18T13:58:01  <conor_f> or C++ for that matter
2011-12-18T13:58:15  <avdg> meh, I wish our brain was designed to code in asm
2011-12-18T13:58:31  <yoden> i feel like you shouldn't criticize his language choice considering how much better he is than everyone :P
2011-12-18T13:58:34  <conor_f> yes, I do to. I really want to learn it but its so hard :/
2011-12-18T13:58:44  <mcstar> i wish abstraction didnt have the practical penalties sometimes
2011-12-18T13:58:53  <xathis> mcstar: haha, but i think i won't win, GreanTee's bot looked better than mine before he resubmitted and flag is doing very good as well
2011-12-18T13:59:04  <avdg> meh, asm isn't a hard language, but I still need to learn how to code in it
2011-12-18T13:59:15  <mcstar> xathis: the one playing is your last version?
2011-12-18T13:59:16  <_flag> xathis: Don't kid yourself, I don't have much of a chance :)
2011-12-18T13:59:24  <avdg> the model in details and getting it worked are hard for me
2011-12-18T13:59:24  <Garf> if you're not hand-writing SIMD, there's little reason to use assembler

2011-12-18T13:59:51  <conor_f> avdg: I find it difficult
2011-12-18T13:59:56  <xathis> mcstar: i will upload a v3 but it has only very small fixes
2011-12-18T13:59:58  <conor_f> especially the different processors shit
2011-12-18T14:00:00  <Extrarius> Garf: If you ARE hand-writing SIMD, there isn't much reason for asm. These days just about every compiler exposes simd as intrinsics
2011-12-18T14:00:24  <avdg> conor_f: maybe I find it easy, because I already designed a very simple processor (but I didn't had to build an alu)
2011-12-18T14:00:25  <Garf> Extrarius: true, and it's even required unless you want to integrate NASM or friends, and are on x64

2011-12-18T14:00:57  <conor_f> heh, avdg, you have some years experience on me I'd imagine ;)
2011-12-18T14:01:18  <avdg> nah, I had more interest than learning and, or and not gates in classes
2011-12-18T14:01:18  * mcstar wonders why are we talking about asm and such when AI wont come to those who stick to low-level languages
2011-12-18T14:01:44  <Extrarius> the next AI challenge should include the option of programming in LLVM "asm"
2011-12-18T14:02:05  <bmh> Extrarius: if you provide a starter kit, I believe they'll support it
2011-12-18T14:02:31  <avdg> other people got stuck by the behavior of the ports, but I understand it already and tried to figure out the next board (clocks, counters and memories)
2011-12-18T14:02:47  <mcstar> Extrarius: you can program in anything tha can be installed/provided for the server configuration with not much trouble
2011-12-18T14:02:55  <avdg> just few registries, an alu and you have a processor
2011-12-18T14:02:59  <Extrarius> sure, but I have to finish my map generator, then maybe try to make my bot not suck, etc.

2011-12-18T14:04:23  <Extrarius> I really wish the contest didn't overlap with me buying a house and moving into it. I would have loved to really develop a bot. Hopefully the next challenge will be as interesting as this one (the previous ones don't sound as interesting to me as this one)
2011-12-18T14:04:41  <conor_f> when will it be, the next one?
2011-12-18T14:04:42  <avdg> sad my ants don't panic :/
2011-12-18T14:06:09  <avdg> 10 hours
2011-12-18T14:07:25  <mcstar> what?
2011-12-18T14:07:41  <mcstar> it grabs the time from my computer?
2011-12-18T14:07:54  <Garf> Extrarius: There's JavaScript backend for LLVM. So that already works :P

2011-12-18T14:11:49  <mcstar> i just got 1 free hour till the contest ends lol
2011-12-18T14:11:53  <avdg> I wonder if there are languages that won't trigger the gc if they don't get the time to idle
2011-12-18T14:12:27  <avdg> js looks fine
2011-12-18T14:12:46  <Garf> all languages without a GC, obviously
2011-12-18T14:12:56  <avdg> :p
2011-12-18T14:13:50  <Extrarius> you can control the GC in python
2011-12-18T14:14:03  <avdg> in node.js you can't :/
2011-12-18T14:15:07  <yoden> theoretically, G1 can take that sort of hinting
2011-12-18T14:15:17  <yoden> never really got it to be usable though

2011-12-18T14:21:19  <avdg> meh, mine contains a lot of bugs ;-)
2011-12-18T14:21:29  <Extrarius> one change I would have liked to see in this challenge was better bots in the starter kit. Maybe I'll write some for the next challenge if I find it interesting
2011-12-18T14:21:35  <avdg> I probably should blame my brain
2011-12-18T14:21:40  <avdg> but oh well
2011-12-18T14:22:17  <Extrarius> mine has no bugs and no AI
2011-12-18T14:22:30  <mcstar> Extrarius: nonono come on, starter bots are too good as they are
2011-12-18T14:22:36  <Garf> I'd prefer to see *less* in the starter kit

2011-12-18T14:23:48  <Extrarius> Garf: I'd be ok with a rule that would diff the submitted code against starter bots and reject it if the simmilarity ratio is too high

2011-12-18T14:24:24  <mcstar> too messy

2011-12-18T15:05:08  <conor_f> yeah, I know
2011-12-18T15:05:17  <conor_f> I think I have an off by one somewhere :/
2011-12-18T15:05:27  <mcstar> maybe you trim the path
2011-12-18T15:05:48  <conor_f> and I never noticed it with the food (its the same algorithm) because you don't have to be _on_ the food to get it
2011-12-18T15:05:49  <mcstar> or just cant handle paths with 1 length
2011-12-18T15:06:01  <mcstar> you have to step on the hill
2011-12-18T15:06:05  <conor_f> yeah
2011-12-18T15:06:07  <mcstar> food is different
2011-12-18T15:06:15  <conor_f> thats why I think I never noticed before
2011-12-18T15:06:17  <mcstar> you just have to step on the side of it
2011-12-18T15:06:42  <conor_f> hmm, weird :/
2011-12-18T15:06:43  <mcstar> you just make your bot aware of hills?
2011-12-18T15:06:51  <mcstar> *just*
2011-12-18T15:06:52  <conor_f> :P
2011-12-18T15:06:52  <janzert> @later tell bugnuts I wouldn't mind that and can't think of a problem with it offhand so long as it is the user that decides

2011-12-18T15:07:29  <conor_f> lol, I think I actually had a good idea XD I'll wait to see if it'll work first

2011-12-18T15:27:59  <thestinger> so it leaks a socket now and then
2011-12-18T15:28:16  <thestinger> sometimes it leaks them in a loop and crashes
2011-12-18T15:28:28  <Antimony> I have the buggy client too. I wrote a script which calls the client in a loop. So after each iteration, the client should be terminated and cleaned up

2011-12-18T15:29:26  <Zaphus> yay, the version I uploaded last night got to a Skill of 75 faster than any bot I've previously uploaded, and that includes the 'dud' double game which didnt alter ratings...  10 games, or 9 that count - I'l happy with that.
2011-12-18T15:29:32  <thestinger> wow, it's empty.
2011-12-18T15:29:39  <mcstar> oh, there are racket and scheme separately
2011-12-18T15:29:59  <thestinger> well, if you submit a MyBot.ss you can just submit a precompiled MyBot binary
2011-12-18T15:30:12  <thestinger> and it counts as a scheme bot
2011-12-18T15:30:27  <Zaphus> I just hope they don't make 1-on-1 maps a big part of the finals, my bot specialises in more players than that!
2011-12-18T15:30:34  <mcstar> i never checked the scheme category, cause i saw racket, and thought there is only one

2011-12-18T16:06:14  <yoden> hah, that was what i added yesterday
2011-12-18T16:06:23  <yoden> and then i discovered my pathfinding is very very slow when paths are blocked :X

2011-12-18T16:07:20  <Kommander> anyone has any times for debugging a werid python timeout?
2011-12-18T16:07:48  <thestinger> I need to adjust how much my ants block goals, because pile ups are the biggest issue in my bot

2011-12-18T16:52:32  <avdg> lol
2011-12-18T16:52:35  <thestinger> and then I'll have under 500 ants again
2011-12-18T16:52:37  <BenJackson> my bot's ant value function drops over 200 and again over 250 ants
2011-12-18T16:52:49  <BenJackson> so it will start with the battering ram tactics and thus never get overloaded
2011-12-18T16:52:59  <thestinger> BenJackson: oh, that's something I should implement
2011-12-18T16:53:13  <BenJackson> I should probably have changed it
2011-12-18T16:53:17  <avdg> I hate to implement stuff like that tbh
2011-12-18T16:53:20  <thestinger> I should adjust the score to make my ants proper barbarians if I have a lot of them
2011-12-18T16:53:23  <BenJackson> I found a better knob to make my ants more aggressive than lowering their value
2011-12-18T16:53:26  <thestinger> just a line of code to change it
2011-12-18T16:53:57  <avdg> but oh well, my bot was also just nothing more than an experiment
2011-12-18T16:54:01  <BenJackson> judging by how many ants V13 is moving on bhickey right now I think it's winning :)
2011-12-18T16:54:21  <Murashka> xathis back to fluxid :)
2011-12-18T16:54:24  <thestinger> well, regardless of what rank I get in the finals it was worth it :P
2011-12-18T16:54:31  <BenJackson> totally
2011-12-18T16:54:38  <thestinger> I learned C++ and really got to know git well
2011-12-18T16:54:46  <avdg> Murashka: hmm, so xathis is still testing his bot?
2011-12-18T16:54:53  <mcstar> lol, your bots are fine, of course it was worth it
2011-12-18T16:55:04  <BenJackson> in my last game I lost to memetix (who is at #2?!) and beat a1k0n (at 5) so clearly my bot is good for #3 or #4!
2011-12-18T16:55:07  <antimatroid> i wonder if greentea scared xathis
2011-12-18T16:55:26  <thestinger> I think I should learn a new language for the next contest too :)
2011-12-18T16:55:28  <xathis> avdg: i made some really small fixes, will upload v3 in a few hours
2011-12-18T16:55:29  <avdg> meh, if it wasn't greentea, it would be someone else
2011-12-18T16:55:30  <thestinger> clojure looks fun
2011-12-18T16:55:42  <Murashka> maybe it's very hard to test bot now...very strange results
2011-12-18T16:55:48  <antimatroid> xathis: ohhhh :)
2011-12-18T16:56:12  <antimatroid> xathis: greentea was doing well against you yesterday
2011-12-18T16:56:22  <avdg> there are many good bots around atm
2011-12-18T16:56:42  <xathis> antimatroid: GreenTea really scares me, he won more than half of the games we were both in
2011-12-18T16:56:52  <antimatroid> and then resubmittied :)
2011-12-18T16:57:05  <BenJackson> it's weird to see bots I still think of as "really good" slipping down and down the ranks

2011-12-18T17:05:41  <antimatroid> thestinger: I just added a similar thing to my battle thing

2011-12-18T17:07:47  <conor_f> that would take me a week to implement
2011-12-18T17:07:49  <thestinger> the # of enemies per battle is already there
2011-12-18T17:07:54  <thestinger> and I have a function to find nearby ants
2011-12-18T17:08:12  <thestinger> and my combat is based on a score
2011-12-18T17:08:24  <thestinger> so I can adjust the value of a kill or a death

2011-12-18T17:12:33  <Antimony> ug, one of the maps on fluxid violated specifications
2011-12-18T17:12:33  <amstan> or #aiclass

2011-12-18T17:12:56  <Antimony> I need to figure out a way to make my bot do at least decent on broken maps

2011-12-18T17:13:13  <BenJackson> conor_f: I think I should post an inner loop like ... while(true) { if (state.grid(loc).opponent == XATHIS) { antiXathisMove(loc) } else if ...
2011-12-18T17:13:28  <amstan> BenJackson: that was my rps bot
2011-12-18T17:13:33  <amstan> s/xathis/greenberg
2011-12-18T17:13:59  <Antimony> it violates specifications
2011-12-18T17:14:06  <amstan> Antimony: which ones?
2011-12-18T17:14:22  <Antimony> this map has 7 players and area of only 6174 http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.41801
2011-12-18T17:14:35  <Antimony> Minimum area per player is 900
2011-12-18T17:14:41  <amstan> that's not that bad

2011-12-18T17:15:09  <Antimony> well it is if you assume that the map is compliant when writing your code
2011-12-18T17:15:11  <amstan> your bot should work in those situations, it's just a fairness thing
2011-12-18T17:15:39  <amstan> the rules that are more binary in nature is that anti-blocking rule, where you need 3 wide corridors
2011-12-18T17:15:42  <amstan> there's no way around that
2011-12-18T17:16:00  <amstan> but stuff like map area is not that essential
2011-12-18T17:16:07  <amstan> especially if we're talking about 20 squares under the limit
2011-12-18T17:16:23  *** jstemmer <jstemmer!~cheetah@mrpwn.stemmertech.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-18T17:16:27  <BenJackson> btw janzert said you were in favor of a new map type for the finals
2011-12-18T17:16:34  <BenJackson> I will join him in being against that
2011-12-18T17:16:39  <Antimony> But the thing is that it breaks symmettry detection
2011-12-18T17:16:44  <Antimony> and my bot uses that to infer water
2011-12-18T17:16:51  <amstan> yes, i was hoping to get them earlier
2011-12-18T17:16:53  <Antimony> so it thinks there's water where there isn't and vice versa
2011-12-18T17:17:07  <BenJackson> amstan: even if you introduced them now it's too late
2011-12-18T17:17:07  <amstan> BenJackson: they're the cave maps i was working on
2011-12-18T17:17:13  <BenJackson> lots of people would never play them before the finals
2011-12-18T17:17:44  <amstan> well, it's in the repo, nobody's stopping you from testing your bot against them
2011-12-18T17:18:17  <BenJackson> if those new maps appear to change the outcome of the finals I think people will complain bitterly and with good cause
2011-12-18T17:18:53  <amstan> i really don't understand the people complaining though
2011-12-18T17:19:02  <BenJackson> personally I think after random walks, mazes and cell mazes I can probably handle anything legal
2011-12-18T17:19:07  <BenJackson> caves are probably similar enough to cell mazes
2011-12-18T17:19:09  <amstan> a lot of other contests don't even give you a chance to practice with other bots

2011-12-18T17:19:17  <amstan> you get a submission at the end and that's the result
2011-12-18T17:19:44  <amstan> we might be adding other maps to play in 10% of the time, it really shouldn't affect your bot that much
2011-12-18T17:20:17  <BenJackson> there are already over 300 maps (or last time I looked) and janzert estimated the top cut of bots would each play about 200 games
2011-12-18T17:20:23  <Scryer> I pulled the maps from the repo a bit ago to do my local tournaments against -- not that it's helped me all that much. :)
2011-12-18T17:20:24  <BenJackson> so there's already inevitable map imbalance
2011-12-18T17:20:26  <Migi32> amstan: well, nothing in the contest rules says you won't set the turntime on those maps to 1 millisecond, etc ;)

2011-12-18T17:20:54  <avdg> well, there is kind of such a guarantee
2011-12-18T17:20:56  <amstan> but there's pretty big warnings on map types and stuff

2011-12-18T17:21:07  <avdg> bots should not brake after an update

2011-12-18T17:21:27  <thestinger> per-battle
2011-12-18T17:21:31  <thestinger> so it's not perfect atm
2011-12-18T17:21:31  <avdg> *break
2011-12-18T17:21:48  <BenJackson> n_enemies + 2
2011-12-18T17:21:53  <BenJackson> (in my case :)
2011-12-18T17:22:07  <Migi32> amstan: I know, I like the fact that we have new maps for the final results, it makes preprocessing and some kinds of cheating impossible. But maybe I would change the maps more often, like once every day or so
2011-12-18T17:22:10  <conor_f> thats still an implementation, mightn't work the best but it does something
2011-12-18T17:22:16  <thestinger> BenJackson: well, n_enemies is the whole partition of enemies
2011-12-18T17:22:25  <thestinger> nearby_friends is just a method I had lying around
2011-12-18T17:22:35  <BenJackson> yeah I did connected-area-coloring to partition battles for performance
2011-12-18T17:22:35  <amstan> Migi32: that's kinda hard given that we need to code new map generators
2011-12-18T17:22:36  <thestinger> it's the # of ants with the same player within attackradius
2011-12-18T17:22:42  <BenJackson> but it turned out to yield important strategic data

2011-12-18T17:23:59  <antimatroid> they are my favourite

2011-12-18T17:31:20  <thestinger> _line makes them more willing to take alternate routes and form long lines, and hopefully they are more confident when the enemy is outnumbered now
2011-12-18T17:31:41  <BenJackson> so I don't know about you guys but I've flipflopped:  I love random walk now
2011-12-18T17:31:45  <antimatroid> who's in this big game with me atm?
2011-12-18T17:32:03  <antimatroid> BenJackson: for ants nowhere near anything?
2011-12-18T17:32:08  <antimatroid> or joking?
2011-12-18T17:32:20  * avdg wonders if he was refering to my ant
2011-12-18T17:32:22  <antimatroid> i actually considered that is why, but decided that's mental
2011-12-18T17:32:22  <thestinger> BenJackson: I love big maps
2011-12-18T17:32:23  <BenJackson> the open space for surface area for big fights
2011-12-18T17:32:28  <thestinger> big random walks are fun
2011-12-18T17:32:32  <thestinger> I just hate the little ones
2011-12-18T17:32:34  <BenJackson> mazes and cell mazes are just variations on various bottleneck themes
2011-12-18T17:32:35  <conor_f> I prefer mazes
2011-12-18T17:32:39  <avdg> my ants love food, its their passion :p
2011-12-18T17:32:47  <BenJackson> I really should have optimized my combat for 3 and 4-wide mazes
2011-12-18T17:32:49  <conor_f> especially the non-square ones
2011-12-18T17:32:53  <nha> my ants have trouble dealing with those tiny passages on randomwalk maps
2011-12-18T17:32:53  <BenJackson> put in some kind of special case
2011-12-18T17:33:02  <thestinger> big cell mazes (not the ones with really thick walls) and big random walks are the ones I like now
2011-12-18T17:33:08  <nha> they tend to stupidly cluster there when an enemy is holed in
2011-12-18T17:33:13  <antimatroid> it probably is worth spreading ants out in the middle isn't it?
2011-12-18T17:33:15  <thestinger> the problem with some of the big cell mazes is that 1k turns is barely enough
2011-12-18T17:33:16  <antimatroid> i don't at all
2011-12-18T17:33:22  <antimatroid> i could try that, or just go with what i have
2011-12-18T17:33:39  <antimatroid> i'm pretty keen to submit and make sure i don't need to do a last minute scramble to make it compile
2011-12-18T17:33:40  <BenJackson> reload bhickey (slow), ok reload tcpants (failed last time, still not succeeding), ok reload aichallenge profile (slow)
2011-12-18T17:33:47  <BenJackson> then I feel bad about hounding all those servers
2011-12-18T17:34:42  <antimatroid> everything is dying today

2011-12-18T17:34:58  <BenJackson> nope
2011-12-18T17:35:06  <thestinger> bmh: I think we killed your server :(
2011-12-18T17:35:08  <Antimony> I did, but I'm not sure if it helped or not
2011-12-18T17:35:27  <BenJackson> if I had I was going to constrain it to low-food, multi-hill maps
2011-12-18T17:35:39  <BenJackson> since the lower the food and the more hills the more random it was anyway
2011-12-18T17:35:40  <antimatroid> did we kill bhickey?
2011-12-18T17:35:47  <Antimony> I don't bother trying to estimate food rate

2011-12-18T17:36:16  <BenJackson> thestinger: not drand48(), though, those turn out to be really slow

2011-12-18T17:40:54  <BenJackson> hahaha
2011-12-18T17:40:55  <thestinger> if only I had more time to come up with the perfect set of numbers...
2011-12-18T17:40:59  <BenJackson> that must be why ChrisH uses so much mem
2011-12-18T17:41:10  <BenJackson> use setup time and early turns to make a huge rand() buffer to save on rand later
2011-12-18T17:41:15  <nha> just use a stupid linear congruential generator?
2011-12-18T17:41:34  <BenJackson> bmh: like magic
2011-12-18T17:41:47  <bmh> BenJackson: looking into it
2011-12-18T17:41:50  <thestinger> nha: that's what rand() does with glibc :P
2011-12-18T17:42:01  <antimatroid> how expensive is rand()?
2011-12-18T17:42:02  <BenJackson> bmh: given other faults of the tcp code you may be out of file descriptors/sockets

2011-12-18T17:42:05  <BenJackson> due to some leak
2011-12-18T17:42:15  <BenJackson> rand() is pretty fast
2011-12-18T17:42:19  <BenJackson> drand48() is not
2011-12-18T17:42:23  <BenJackson> it's like 10x slower
2011-12-18T17:42:27  <bmh> BenJackson: I'm going to bounce the server

2011-12-18T17:42:52  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random I could use the C++11 mersenne twister on turn 0
2011-12-18T17:42:54  <BenJackson> do you see how many ants I'm moving?
2011-12-18T17:43:02  <bmh> I hate Mersenne Twister.
2011-12-18T17:43:16  <Migi32> if you had boost you could use taus88

2011-12-18T17:57:03  <McLeopold> not from me
2011-12-18T17:57:14  <antimatroid> how long have they been around?

2011-12-18T17:57:28  <Wraithan> I like the cell maze maps
2011-12-18T17:57:30  <Wraithan> they are interesting
2011-12-18T17:58:30  <McLeopold> @later tell amstan: I can only get your map generator to produce 4 player maps.  Given only 6 hours left, I'm thinking we should just stick with the 3 types we have.
2011-12-18T17:58:30  <contestbot> McLeopold: Yep.
2011-12-18T17:58:57  <_flag> McLeopold: What will be the ratios of the map types in the final contest?

2011-12-18T18:07:10  <UncleVasya> :)
2011-12-18T18:07:44  <thestinger> I'll just tweak some stuff to convince myself I made an improvement

2011-12-18T18:08:47  <mcstar> after the contest pls run another one: which bot does what it doesn faster
2011-12-18T18:08:55  <mcstar> in that category i might stand a chance
2011-12-18T18:08:58  <antimatroid> bmh: no idea who i'm playing
2011-12-18T18:09:02  <mcstar> its not much, but its really fast
2011-12-18T18:09:05  <Migi32> I wonder if the server will be able to handle all the last-second submissions in time. And how many people will submit 1 second past the deadline. :)

2011-12-18T18:15:38  <Migi32> well 5s turntime is just too much imho. Also, you shouldn't send 5s to the clients, make them think it's 500 ms but modify the server so the real timeout check is actually more than that
2011-12-18T18:16:13  <yoden> is it actually sending 5s?  because fluxid doesn't

2011-12-18T18:24:31  <dragonfyre13> It's not perfect, but the starting point is memetix stuff
2011-12-18T18:24:42  <dragonfyre13> or rather, what I had before that (what he posted was somewhat flawed)
2011-12-18T18:24:55  <antimatroid> right, my bot is not changing
2011-12-18T18:25:29  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Basically, it assumes they are going to be smart, then adjusts appropriately to where thier good moves could potentially be, then assumes they might do the same, so refines further, etc.
2011-12-18T18:26:04  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Real trick is knowing when to go in for the kill. This is my conservative version, aggressive ends up getting creamed since I don't have good coverage code (thus few bots)
2011-12-18T18:26:11  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: I have something similar (and also had this before he posted it). But I have no idea how my old bot (currently #18 on the server) does nice coordinated attacks with it, but my new version doesn't...

2011-12-18T18:47:35  <antimatroid> no idea

2011-12-18T18:52:09  <antimatroid> i'm still on game 1/5 :(
2011-12-18T18:52:39  <besh> Really? my bot seem to pile up ants.
2011-12-18T18:52:44  <besh> antimatroid:^
2011-12-18T18:53:34  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-18T18:53:59  <thestinger> besh: you mean the encirclement?
2011-12-18T18:54:05  <thestinger> by changing +3 to +6
2011-12-18T18:54:09  <thestinger> I should change it to +10 now
2011-12-18T18:54:38  <thestinger> well, I used to make paths 3 longer (instead of 1) when going through one of my ants (for certain goals)
2011-12-18T18:54:52  <thestinger> so I'm just playing with that
2011-12-18T18:54:59  <thestinger> my combat could use some tweaks too
2011-12-18T18:55:12  <besh> i had it at at +3 yesterday and still piled up a lot. Let me look up a typical game from fluxid...
2011-12-18T18:55:15  <thestinger> need to make them more willing to strafe
2011-12-18T18:55:22  <Vaenom> there's 21 ranked players at bhickey and the last one has -1.6986 as skills

2011-12-18T19:19:34  <antimatroid> avdg: i suspect most still interested are worrying about what to submit
2011-12-18T19:19:45  <avdg> still :-)
2011-12-18T19:19:53  <antimatroid> i'm in now, so i can sit back and relax a bit
2011-12-18T19:20:01  <avdg> :-)
2011-12-18T19:20:20  <antimatroid> i'm not even going to play on tcp again (maybe after submissions close)
2011-12-18T19:20:25  <antimatroid> it will only tempt me to change things
2011-12-18T19:20:34  <antimatroid> i will watch my profile for timeouts/crashes though
2011-12-18T19:20:38  <antimatroid> considering :P
2011-12-18T19:20:39  <Migi32> ah, finally found the off-by-1 error that screwed up my combat
2011-12-18T19:20:44  <Migi32> let's see if things go better now
2011-12-18T19:20:52  <avdg> fluxid is closed after the deadline ;-)

2011-12-18T19:21:41  <antimatroid> hopefully at least one stays up until interest dies down
2011-12-18T19:21:47  <antimatroid> it usually does within a week or two anyway
2011-12-18T19:21:59  <antimatroid> i will run my bot for the sake of others later
2011-12-18T19:22:00  <avdg> meh, I need another challenge before I'm interested again
2011-12-18T19:22:16  <antimatroid> avdg: this is why i want tcp servers for past contests
2011-12-18T19:22:19  <antimatroid> so people are always hooked
2011-12-18T19:22:29  <avdg> and I probably need to learn more libraries (but I still have to learn the low lvl mechanics, because my brain works that way)
2011-12-18T19:22:41  <avdg> hmm
2011-12-18T19:22:47  <Migi32> antimatroid: why don't you run one yourself? Not so many people will play on it anyway, so it probably won't cost much
2011-12-18T19:22:50  <antimatroid> i don't use any libraries
2011-12-18T19:22:55  <antimatroid> other than like std
2011-12-18T19:23:08  <antimatroid> Migi32: i might look into it later
2011-12-18T19:23:17  <antimatroid> i'm a poor student though :P
2011-12-18T19:23:28  <antimatroid> i have no experience with web development stuff either too
2011-12-18T19:23:47  <antimatroid> i imagine tron would get a small following for a while
2011-12-18T19:23:48  * avdg is probably more broke, since he can't study (the official way) atm
2011-12-18T19:24:09  <antimatroid> i'm actually not a student atm :P
2011-12-18T19:24:15  <Migi32> I missed tron, so I would be interested, I think. Maybe just for a little while
2011-12-18T19:24:22  <antimatroid> i'm waiting to find out if i am getting funded for phd, otherwise i have to go find a job
2011-12-18T19:30:33  <antimatroid> i'm half expecting my bot to start timing out/crashing
2011-12-18T19:30:37  <antimatroid> just cause that'd serve me right :P

2011-12-18T19:48:06  <antimatroid> my bot is very rushed
2011-12-18T19:48:17  <antimatroid> although still probably a good months worth
2011-12-18T19:48:59  <BenJackson> it's bad for me that "Memetix combat" is the well publicized version because it's probably particularly strong against my slightly randomized combat
2011-12-18T19:49:18  <BenJackson> it is perfect for sitting there and waiting for me to make mistakes or inadvisable breakout attempts
2011-12-18T19:49:22  <antimatroid> i dunno how my combat compares to others?

2011-12-18T19:49:52  <antimatroid> thestinger: sure, but the heuristics used to pick moves are quite important
2011-12-18T19:49:59  <antimatroid> and i'm not sure how used our method is

2011-12-18T20:09:45  <antimatroid> i can't imagine the map checker isn't checking it for new maps, but it is a new map so i dunno
2011-12-18T20:09:46  <bmh> and if you don't mind me capriciously killing/lagging the server
2011-12-18T20:09:54  <thestinger> I guess I should try _longline :)

2011-12-18T20:14:44  <thestinger> bmh: it's probably not possible
2011-12-18T20:14:51  <thestinger> if ghc requires the new glibc
2011-12-18T20:15:00  <thestinger> I don't think there's any way to really statically link the locale stuff
2011-12-18T20:15:03  <bmh> Yeah. GHC 7.x requires glibc >= 2.7
2011-12-18T20:15:16  <antimatroid> what about what janzert suggested?
2011-12-18T20:15:44  <bmh> antimatroid: which suggestion?
2011-12-18T20:15:56  <antimatroid> dunno, weren't you talking to him yesterday?
2011-12-18T20:16:00  <thestinger> bmh: I think it's possible to have another libc in /opt, but then that would have to be done on the server
2011-12-18T20:16:01  <antimatroid> something to make it appear as scheme
2011-12-18T20:16:32  <bmh> antimatroid: yeah. The server will atempt to execute my binary, which then explodes due to a glibc mismatch.
2011-12-18T20:16:41  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-12-18T20:18:30  <Antimony> I figured out one possible reason why my spawn control wasn't helping - my bot was expecting hills to spawn in the opposite order of how they should

2011-12-18T20:54:00  <thestinger> I try to figure out which is the weaker neighbour
2011-12-18T20:54:02  <thestinger> and rush them
2011-12-18T20:54:15  <thestinger> I don't really keep track of 'score'
2011-12-18T20:54:18  <thestinger> more like 'threat'
2011-12-18T20:54:28  <BenJackson> what's metric for weaker?
2011-12-18T20:54:34  <BenJackson> and would you quit rushing me!  I'm not weak
2011-12-18T20:54:37  <BenJackson> until you rush me
2011-12-18T20:54:46  <avdg> heh, strcat loves building walls and escaping in no time as the next move
2011-12-18T20:55:15  <BenJackson> only my latest versions fixed the "escaping walls" bug
2011-12-18T20:55:18  <BenJackson> that was really gratifying
2011-12-18T20:55:18  <thestinger> yeah, my bot has issues with commitment :P

2011-12-18T20:55:53  <thestinger> I might remove it
2011-12-18T20:55:53  <BenJackson> I considered death "heatmaps" but never did it
2011-12-18T20:55:54  <dragonfyre13> by the way, just so you're aware, wingide is AWESOME for it's slick remote debugging stuff that I wouldn't be able to do without in this. And of course piping a replay to stdin to reproduce conditions.
2011-12-18T20:55:56  <amstan> contestbot: seen McLeopold
2011-12-18T20:55:56  <contestbot> amstan: McLeopold was last seen in #aichallenge 2 hours, 28 minutes, and 54 seconds ago: <McLeopold> geeze, why can the tcp admins use acceptable maps ?
2011-12-18T20:56:07  <avdg> meh, my vcs says I have (accidently) 100 commits for my js bot
2011-12-18T20:56:15  <thestinger> BenJackson: strcat_line doesn't use that, because it screwed everything up
2011-12-18T20:56:18  <thestinger> like, they'll form a line
2011-12-18T20:56:27  <thestinger> and then decide to attack a different enemy because an ant diedc
2011-12-18T20:56:29  <BenJackson>  $ git log --pretty=oneline | wc -l
2011-12-18T20:56:29  <BenJackson>      178
2011-12-18T20:56:53  <thestinger> lol, all my tiny tweaks of constants are in the git history
2011-12-18T20:57:19  <BenJackson> e51cddf073b457e66dd520ae21992262fd5aedb4 Add combat!  It was glorious!!!
2011-12-18T20:57:28  <thestinger> I have like 200 commits where I change a number from 2 to 3 and back again
2011-12-18T20:57:38  <BenJackson> and with that sha you know my bot as of V5 if you can figure out what made that hash..
2011-12-18T20:57:49  <avdg> meh, I had such good commits at the start until I hit problems

2011-12-18T21:00:04  <antimatroid> thestinger: what we should have done is looked a few moves ahead
2011-12-18T21:00:05  <avdg> and 1050 submissions
2011-12-18T21:00:13  <thestinger> antimatroid: too late :P
2011-12-18T21:00:23  <BenJackson> I'd love to start over with all different priorities
2011-12-18T21:00:29  <thestinger> I would have done a lot of things if I hadn't wasted so much time
2011-12-18T21:00:36  <bmh> Best outcome from the AI Competition: meeting people.
2011-12-18T21:00:38  <antimatroid> i know
2011-12-18T21:00:39  <antimatroid> just sayin
2011-12-18T21:00:42  <BenJackson> but unlike ChrisH I decided to tread water to try and stay in top 10
2011-12-18T21:00:50  <BenJackson> rather than make hail-marys trying for #1
2011-12-18T21:00:57  <antimatroid> :P
2011-12-18T21:01:03  <antimatroid> i prefer the ChrisH approach
2011-12-18T21:01:08  <antimatroid> try all the things
2011-12-18T21:01:11  <antimatroid> but i didn't have time for this one
2011-12-18T21:01:45  <dragonfyre13> hey neat. I run REALLY quick when my ants only see a water cell as the only viable move.
2011-12-18T21:01:48  <thestinger> I think I've used every container (other than strings) in the C++ standard lib now :)
2011-12-18T21:01:53  <antimatroid> still waiting on my second official game, not much i could do if it crashed/timed out now anyway though
2011-12-18T21:02:00  <thestinger> oh, I used multiset but not multimap
2011-12-18T21:02:17  <BenJackson> antimatroid: cry
2011-12-18T21:02:26  <thestinger> and forward_list wasn't very useful
2011-12-18T21:02:29  <antimatroid> BenJackson: pretty much
2011-12-18T21:02:35  * avdg needs to learn how to deal with memory allocation in c++ for pools
2011-12-18T21:02:51  <BenJackson> avdg: the std containers all take allocator functors as template args

2011-12-18T21:04:36  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: yes, V11 is the final one. posted it a couple hours ago, just a minor tweak from V10 to address a little but
2011-12-18T21:04:41  <ChrisH_> s/but/bug
2011-12-18T21:04:58  <antimatroid> Greentea submitted again
2011-12-18T21:05:17  <antimatroid> xathis is planning another submission
2011-12-18T21:05:22  <antimatroid> i think, he's cutting it fine
2011-12-18T21:05:23  <ChrisH_> interesting
2011-12-18T21:05:29  <thestinger> antimatroid: I kept using C++11 features that aren't in gcc 4.5 so I ended up reuploading like 40 times to fix compiler errors
2011-12-18T21:05:41  <BenJackson> if xathis knocks himself out of 1st we can all point at the follies of youth
2011-12-18T21:05:42  <antimatroid> thestinger: glad I didn't have such issues :P
2011-12-18T21:05:48  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: I see you won your first game, that's a good sign ;)
2011-12-18T21:05:49  <avdg> just these 2 people I expect another submission left :/ (xathis and migi32)
2011-12-18T21:06:04  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: yeah, i was REALLY nervous when it was compiling etc.
2011-12-18T21:06:10  <ChrisH_> hehe
2011-12-18T21:06:23  <BenJackson> I'm nervous every time I see "now playing in a game"
2011-12-18T21:06:29  <antimatroid> how old is xathis?
2011-12-18T21:06:29  <BenJackson> even if I know I'm playing #1000 bots
2011-12-18T21:06:35  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-18T21:06:39  <antimatroid> another 16a? :P
2011-12-18T21:06:47  <ChrisH_> I am once my mu is over 85
2011-12-18T21:07:00  <antimatroid> so am i, but this was a bigger level of nervous :P
2011-12-18T21:07:50  <ChrisH_> Memetix really came on strong recently, his latest bot has a shot at a top 5 finish i think
2011-12-18T21:08:07  <bmh> I bet a1k0n will accidentally win :)

2011-12-18T21:15:12  <antimatroid> :)
2011-12-18T21:15:18  <BenJackson> oh I like that map from your second game
2011-12-18T21:15:20  <BenJackson> I tested with it a lot
2011-12-18T21:15:21  <besh> i think i should call it it dshawul_line
2011-12-18T21:15:32  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: possibly :P
2011-12-18T21:15:38  <antimatroid> i hope to be top ranked first version
2011-12-18T21:16:03  <antimatroid> i've never seen it befre  i don't think
2011-12-18T21:16:10  <BenJackson> so weird to watch games vs 1000 place bots where no defensive lines form and the good bots don't even slow down
2011-12-18T21:16:20  <BenJackson> I'm used to tightly contested games now
2011-12-18T21:16:23  <antimatroid> yeah aha
2011-12-18T21:17:17  <BenJackson> besh I did come in second :)
2011-12-18T21:17:29  <ChrisH_> a couple days ago I went back and was watching some of MomoBot's very first games.  kinda funny to see a bot with a skill in the 50's be ranked in the top ten back then
2011-12-18T21:17:55  <BenJackson> besh: that game is probably an example of where code like strcat's to find the weaker neighbor would have helped

2011-12-18T21:18:27  <BenJackson> probabyl could have had rwest "cheap"

2011-12-18T21:19:02  <ChrisH_> that's why I was looking at his early games, he was the #1 bot before xathis submitted
2011-12-18T21:19:06  <BenJackson> yoden: yeah, I somewhat doomed us both
2011-12-18T21:19:18  <BenJackson> if I'd gone for purple I probably would have won overall and you would have gotten points

2011-12-18T21:27:34  <thestinger> the server has decided that strcat_line has to play an endless chain of games against xathis
2011-12-18T21:28:06  <BenJackson> tcpserver has stupid matchmaking

2011-12-18T21:32:07  <Migi32> _flag: on the contrary, if xathis was in the game, it's ok if you lose :p
2011-12-18T21:32:09  <BenJackson> no way I'm trying that now!
2011-12-18T21:32:16  <amstan> BenJackson: when did you submit?
2011-12-18T21:32:31  <amstan> i'm just wondering, because a guy just doesn't seem to be in luck
2011-12-18T21:32:33  <thestinger> amstan: I just resubmitted at what the server called 2am on dec 19th

2011-12-18T21:34:46  <thestinger> yeah it still works
2011-12-18T21:35:33  <avdg> meh, I'm now looking shamed at my lower bound implementation in js, gives me proof that I'm bad in implementation
2011-12-18T21:35:48  <amstan> do you guys know the rules about the folders? i don't remember what we improved on anymore
2011-12-18T21:35:59  <amstan> he has a zip, inside the zip he has a folder called newclean
2011-12-18T21:36:05  <amstan> and inside the folder he has the MyBot.cc
2011-12-18T21:36:09  <amstan> is that ok?
2011-12-18T21:36:14  <avdg> probably not
2011-12-18T21:36:34  <amstan> so folders don't work at all?
2011-12-18T21:36:46  <antimatroid> amstan: i submitted a few hours ago
2011-12-18T21:36:54  <amstan> antimatroid: ok, thanks

2011-12-18T21:36:58  <thestinger> I just do that
2011-12-18T21:37:04  <thestinger> so, no folder inside it
2011-12-18T21:37:09  <avdg> I just select the files, not the folder
2011-12-18T21:37:16  <avdg> then right click (on osx) and zip it

2011-12-18T21:38:58  <jaman4dbz> Sorry, I use irc so infrequently I forget a lot of things, like how to whisper or say to someone =P. How does one do that again?
2011-12-18T21:39:00  <_Lone_Wolf_> not me :D
2011-12-18T21:39:07  <thestinger> jaman4dbz: /msg or /query
2011-12-18T21:39:16  <thestinger>  /query probably opens up a new tab/window/pane

2011-12-18T21:39:22  <amstan> jaman4dbz: you can probably talk in here about everything that's not about your bot code, other people could help too
2011-12-18T21:40:23  *** xathis_ is now known as xathis

2011-12-18T21:43:32  <BenJackson> amstan: I didn't use folders
2011-12-18T21:43:35  <BenJackson> the starer kits don't either
2011-12-18T21:43:40  <thestinger> well, it's the supybot fork from sourceforge or w/e

2011-12-18T21:43:47  <BenJackson> amstan: also I saw j3camero connect and disconnect recently
2011-12-18T21:43:50  <BenJackson> but he didn't say anything
2011-12-18T21:43:54  <amstan> Wraithan: i'm the one happening to manage that bot actually
2011-12-18T21:46:36  <Wraithan> amstan: so implement it and I'll have my bot leave. I don't get why anyone would care at all that someone has a bot in a channel
2011-12-18T21:47:08  <BenJackson> are you kidding? bots are the most contentiuos element of irc and always have been
2011-12-18T21:47:20  <Wraithan> Most of my channels have 3-4 bots at least
2011-12-18T21:47:29  <BenJackson> most hosting providers include "no running irc bot" clauses
2011-12-18T21:47:35  <amstan> Wraithan: just relax.. i didn't say your bot was crappy, it's just standard irc practice to ask an op if you want a bot in the channel
2011-12-18T21:47:41  * avdg would expect a lot of bots in this channels as this is an ai challenge
2011-12-18T21:47:56  <ChrisH_> I am a bot.
2011-12-18T21:48:17  <Wraithan> amstan: been IRCing for 10+ years, if a channel has rules they are posted in the topic. If there are no rules then only server rules apply.
2011-12-18T21:48:18  <BenJackson> I was debating saying that but my bayes network decided not to

2011-12-18T21:55:40  <janzert> ChrisH_: yep, the ones yesterday I fixed last night and the ones today just now.
2011-12-18T21:55:54  <Antimony> At least one of the maps on the server doesn't meet the specifications
2011-12-18T21:55:55  <janzert> two different causes actually

2011-12-18T21:56:48  <besh> Is MomoBot going to resubmit eveeerrr ?
2011-12-18T21:56:52  <janzert> Antimony: which and why?
2011-12-18T21:56:57  <BenJackson> your game rate is 14!
2011-12-18T21:56:58  <BenJackson> wow
2011-12-18T21:57:38  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I thought you had some runtime on your last submit
2011-12-18T21:57:41  <BenJackson> last minute tweak?
2011-12-18T21:57:42  <antimatroid> what are they normally?
2011-12-18T21:57:42  <Antimony> This one is too small. http://aichallenge.org/map.php?map=cell_maze/cell_maze_p07_03.map
2011-12-18T21:57:48  <BenJackson> antimatroid: 60-90
2011-12-18T21:58:10  <antimatroid> what does it mean?
2011-12-18T21:58:16  <BenJackson> minutes per game
2011-12-18T21:58:21  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I don't follow you.
2011-12-18T21:58:22  <antimatroid> ah yeah
2011-12-18T21:58:35  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: runtime on my last submit?
2011-12-18T21:58:37  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: you're not in the top 20 by mu, so you must have resubmitted
2011-12-18T21:58:44  <mcstar> it is done
2011-12-18T21:58:50  <Antimony> this isn't a good sign. My bot randomly crashed, and I have no replay to test it
2011-12-18T21:59:07  <ChrisH_> Oh, yeah, a few hours ago, just a small bug fix and one little tweak to my previous version.
2011-12-18T21:59:20  <thestinger> Antimony: on tcp?
2011-12-18T21:59:23  <Antimony> yeah
2011-12-18T21:59:47  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be too worried about time outs on tcp
2011-12-18T21:59:52  <antimatroid> if your bot actually crashes on the other hand
2011-12-18T22:00:05  <Antimony> So Janzert are the invalid maps going to be removed before the finals start?
2011-12-18T22:00:19  <Antimony> it wasn't a timeout, it actually crashed
2011-12-18T22:00:33  <janzert> all new maps will be generated but using the same generators as the current set
2011-12-18T22:00:39  <janzert> so what current ones are invalid?
2011-12-18T22:00:42  <antimatroid> janzert: where's the code that tests if a map is valid?
2011-12-18T22:00:48  <amstan> that's not cool then
2011-12-18T22:00:56  <Antimony> Well cell_maze_p07_03.map is, I'm not sure if there are others
2011-12-18T22:00:57  <amstan> antimatroid: map.py i think does it
2011-12-18T22:01:04  <thestinger> http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.151 best victory ever :P
2011-12-18T22:01:12  <janzert> antimatroid: map.py mostly I believe but McLeopold has been working on that
2011-12-18T22:01:38  <thestinger> so many bugs that I never fixed
2011-12-18T22:01:39  <amstan> thestinger: that is a gorgeous map
2011-12-18T22:02:20  <besh> Highest number of submissions I found so far : 125  -> pwendel
2011-12-18T22:02:26  <janzert> Antimony: what's illegal about that map? hill density?
2011-12-18T22:02:31  <ChrisH_> No, I saw someone with >200 once
2011-12-18T22:02:36  <Antimony> minimum area per player is 900
2011-12-18T22:02:39  <antimatroid> yeah, players don't have enough territory
2011-12-18T22:02:54  <antimatroid> i'm guessing map.py isn't actually chekcing the players territories?
2011-12-18T22:02:56  <amstan> oh man.. xathis resubmitted
2011-12-18T22:03:07  <antimatroid> and if that's the case i'm guessing we might be able to fix that?
2011-12-18T22:03:10  <Antimony> area per player must be betweeen 900 and 5000
2011-12-18T22:03:34  <amstan> why would you crash if that is not met though?
2011-12-18T22:03:50  <janzert> McLeopold: ping
2011-12-18T22:03:57  <amstan> contestbot: seen mcstar
2011-12-18T22:03:57  <contestbot> amstan: mcstar was last seen in #aichallenge 5 minutes and 12 seconds ago: <mcstar> it is done
2011-12-18T22:03:59  <amstan> contestbot: seen McLeopold
2011-12-18T22:03:59  <contestbot> amstan: McLeopold was last seen in #aichallenge 3 hours, 36 minutes, and 57 seconds ago: <McLeopold> geeze, why can the tcp admins use acceptable maps ?
2011-12-18T22:04:02  <BenJackson> amstan: that's why I jokingly asked for a quick top 20 by mu without him
2011-12-18T22:04:19  <mcstar> yep?
2011-12-18T22:04:26  <amstan> mcstar: sorry :)
2011-12-18T22:04:27  <ChrisH_> raver1975 has 228 submissions:  http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=6113
2011-12-18T22:04:34  <besh> ChrisH_: Yes I found raver1975 with 228 submissions
2011-12-18T22:04:49  <antimatroid> ouch, 2 bad outcomes :(
2011-12-18T22:04:49  <thestinger> ChrisH_: I have a ton of submissions
2011-12-18T22:04:51  <amstan> are you guys having a who did the most submissions contest?
2011-12-18T22:05:02  <thestinger> I used a lot of lambdas and std::arrays and gcc 4.5 wasn't happy
2011-12-18T22:05:12  <thestinger> so it took quite a few resubmissions to fix it all :)
2011-12-18T22:05:28  <amstan> janzert: i haven't talked to him today
2011-12-18T22:05:34  <besh> i wonder who has the most versions on fluxid ;)
2011-12-18T22:05:38  <thestinger> they let you do slightly different things with lambdas in 4.6
2011-12-18T22:05:39  <amstan> janzert: so.. how do you feel about this? ready?
2011-12-18T22:06:01  <besh> probably strcat :) but don't underestimate carlos_guia
2011-12-18T22:06:16  <antimatroid> amstan: i'm doing the opposite :P
2011-12-18T22:06:19  <thestinger> I didn't really have that many, I just named them all memorable things
2011-12-18T22:06:21  <janzert> yep, I the only part I don't know for sure about is map generation but McLeopold had that handled
2011-12-18T22:06:30  <ChrisH_> I had a lot of submissions in beta until i realized that the compiler engine on the server didn't work right for Go, so I submitted a code fix.  :)
2011-12-18T22:06:35  <a1k0n> whoa, xathis version 3?
2011-12-18T22:06:36  <thestinger> besh: http://ants.fluxid.pl/search?name=strcat
2011-12-18T22:07:15  <besh> Aha indeed yours are not that much. carlos_guia had 70=80 versions at one time
2011-12-18T22:07:29  <xathis> v3 is only some really small fixes, probably you won't see any difference
2011-12-18T22:07:30  <amstan> janzert: the only issues i've seen so far are the duplicate matchmakings and timeouts all at the same time, or at the beggining
2011-12-18T22:09:10  <_flag> xathis: Nice games on tcp

2011-12-18T22:10:12  <_flag> xathis: I still had some hope for first, but you seem to have that covered. How much time did you spend on your bot?
2011-12-18T22:10:22  <ChrisH_> xathis: did you see the forum topic regarding your hill siphon idea?
2011-12-18T22:10:35  <amstan> a1k0n: that blue_iris guy... he's like the starter pack champion
2011-12-18T22:10:41  <janzert> hmm, I see nothing recent to test maps with
2011-12-18T22:10:45  <amstan> a1k0n: i think he's the official google language promoter guy
2011-12-18T22:10:50  <avdg> poor dart :p
2011-12-18T22:10:52  <a1k0n> oh really?
2011-12-18T22:11:01  <a1k0n> did he make the dart starter pack?
2011-12-18T22:11:11  <janzert> ahh, found it
2011-12-18T22:11:22  <xathis> _flag: i don't know... during beta i had a lot of time but the last two month i did not do that much
2011-12-18T22:11:24  <amstan> a1k0n: he made javascript(tron), go(tron) and dart(ants) starter packs
2011-12-18T22:11:29  <a1k0n> oh wow
2011-12-18T22:11:30  <janzert> right where I said it was initially, map.py
2011-12-18T22:11:51  <bmh> does anyone know blue_iris's meatspace identity?
2011-12-18T22:11:57  <amstan> janzert: mcleopold might have them in a local copy of the repo
2011-12-18T22:12:04  <amstan> if not... we're screwed, lol
2011-12-18T22:12:07  <xathis> ChrisH_: what topic do you mean on the forum?
2011-12-18T22:12:19  <amstan> bmh: i could try poking around for his email
2011-12-18T22:12:26  <ChrisH_> xathis: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=2158

2011-12-18T22:14:02  <bmh> damn, he's far away
2011-12-18T22:14:26  <janzert> ahh, he's checking the maximum area per player but not the minimum
2011-12-18T22:14:46  <amstan> well, that's an easy fix then

2011-12-18T22:17:18  <_flag> antimatroid: How'd you convince the match schedualer to let you play so many games?
2011-12-18T22:17:19  <ChrisH_> xathis: Yeah, I was just watching aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=272061&user=398, and he doesn't always step on a hill right away, but he doesn't siphon them either, so inconclusive perhaps
2011-12-18T22:17:30  <antimatroid> janzert: is that cause of my first submission?

2011-12-18T22:17:57  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: most likely because your games within last 24 is lower than everyone else
2011-12-18T22:18:03  <janzert> antimatroid: at least partially yes, it is catching your 24 hour game rate up
2011-12-18T22:18:14  <antimatroid> sweet :)
2011-12-18T22:18:20  <dragonfyre13> awesome
2011-12-18T22:18:26  <mcstar> antimatroid: why did you tell me you uploaded at last?
2011-12-18T22:18:30  <amstan> janzert: are we going to be using both servers then?
2011-12-18T22:18:34  <avdg> wow 1111 submissions
2011-12-18T22:18:40  <antimatroid> mcstar: why not? (i don't remember doing this? :P)
2011-12-18T22:18:42  <amstan> both server farms*
2011-12-18T22:18:44  <thestinger> http://bhickey.net:2080/ranking well.. xathis is dominating on tcp :)
2011-12-18T22:18:45  <dragonfyre13> 1 hour, 41 minutes before the competion, I got emergent line approach to hills
2011-12-18T22:18:46  <mcstar> didnt
2011-12-18T22:18:47  <dragonfyre13> very nice

2011-12-18T22:18:54  <janzert> amstan: yes, that's what I was planning
2011-12-18T22:19:00  <xathis> ChrisH_: i don't think that he doesn't step on the hills right away by purpose. one time there are enemies and one time he goes for the food first
2011-12-18T22:19:03  <mcstar> im sorry, i alway write did why i mean didnt
2011-12-18T22:19:20  <amstan> janzert: do we have the cutoff code and submission stoppage code ready?

2011-12-18T22:19:35  <janzert> yes
2011-12-18T22:19:36  <Antimony> wow, just had a stupid divide by 0 error
2011-12-18T22:19:36  <dragonfyre13> okey dokey, I think I improved the map domination stuff, we'll see
2011-12-18T22:19:40  <ChrisH_> xathis: yeah, that could be it. I know my bot would be all over those hills if it had an opening though
2011-12-18T22:19:59  <dragonfyre13> waiting on a tcp slot. Migi32 you still here?
2011-12-18T22:20:00  <BenJackson> it's like a hospital scene with 3 people working on the aichallenge site live
2011-12-18T22:20:03  <amstan> janzert: i think we should manually inspect the maps just to be sure
2011-12-18T22:20:08  <BenJackson> CLAMP!  I need a CLAMP!  I've got submissions cmoing in!
2011-12-18T22:20:09  <mcstar> Antimony: already 83 skill? impressive
2011-12-18T22:20:13  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: yes, why?

2011-12-18T22:20:25  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: you upload your final version to the server?
2011-12-18T22:20:26  <amstan> BenJackson: lol
2011-12-18T22:20:31  <antimatroid> mcstar: :)
2011-12-18T22:20:32  <dragonfyre13> just wondering.
2011-12-18T22:20:35  <Antimony> aww man you got my hopes up
2011-12-18T22:20:42  <thestinger> fatal: Not a git repository
2011-12-18T22:20:43  <thestinger> nice.
2011-12-18T22:20:44  <dragonfyre13> I wanna see if I can face you via tcp at some point
2011-12-18T22:20:46  <thestinger> I broke my git repo
2011-12-18T22:20:51  <amstan> BenJackson: we used to do this in person or via gtalk(only allowed for 2 ppl)
2011-12-18T22:20:59  <dragonfyre13> that's assuming I didn't screw anything serious up
2011-12-18T22:21:07  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: I might just not resubmit. I'm running my old bot on the TCP servers now (Migi_old) and it seems to do much better...
2011-12-18T22:21:20  <janzert> amstan: If any illegal maps are found they can be thrown out, but I'd really rather we not get more selective than that
2011-12-18T22:21:21  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: which servers?
2011-12-18T22:21:28  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: thought only bhickey was up?
2011-12-18T22:21:32  <Migi32> Fluxid and bhickey
2011-12-18T22:21:50  <dragonfyre13> oh that's just nice.... My bot is doing quite well if the number of ants I have is any indication
2011-12-18T22:21:52  <Migi32> Fluxid is up. It's not as slow any more as a few hours ago
2011-12-18T22:21:53  <thestinger> Migi32: yeah, I have fancy new versions but they don't perform well when they're actually tested
2011-12-18T22:21:55  <ChrisH_> amstan: a G+ hangout could work well now
2011-12-18T22:21:56  <BenJackson> tcpants is playing games
2011-12-18T22:21:58  <amstan> antimatroid, janzert: do you guys know why we have a no island rule?
2011-12-18T22:21:59  <BenJackson> but you cant' see the server
2011-12-18T22:22:07  <amstan> ChrisH_: we're not that high tech, lol
2011-12-18T22:22:12  <thestinger> strcat_line makes nice lines, but it seems to be inferior for some reason...
2011-12-18T22:22:21  <BenJackson> how did you force lines?
2011-12-18T22:22:22  <antimatroid> amstan: you mean separated regions?
2011-12-18T22:22:23  <antimatroid> dunno
2011-12-18T22:22:28  <BenJackson> I actually worked out some clever line data structures
2011-12-18T22:22:31  <amstan> and irc works well, since we have a lot of other people too
2011-12-18T22:22:32  <thestinger> BenJackson: I didn't force them
2011-12-18T22:22:32  <BenJackson> but never employed them
2011-12-18T22:22:42  <dragonfyre13> starting a match on fluxid
2011-12-18T22:22:54  <thestinger> BenJackson: I just made my ants add more cost to paths than they already do
2011-12-18T22:23:05  <BenJackson> @rankings
2011-12-18T22:23:08  <contestbot> BenJackson: Top 10 players: Memetix(93.3), lazarant(92.5), pguillory(91.1), delineate(90.6), a1k0n(90.3), FlagCapper(89.4), itzkow(88.8), cheeser(88.4), BenJackson(88.0), teapotahedron(88.0)
2011-12-18T22:23:11  <amstan> antimatroid: yeah.. like.. why is it wrong to have a small island that's not accessible by anyone? pretty much it acts like water for all intensive purposes, except that food might spawn there and never be eaten
2011-12-18T22:23:13  <BenJackson> been a long time!
2011-12-18T22:23:22  <janzert> amstan: I think it is left over from before hills so you couldn't get ants to spawn on an island then not be reachable by other players
2011-12-18T22:23:51  <BenJackson> thestinger: oh, the lines form by ants trying to walk around combat?
2011-12-18T22:23:53  <janzert> it's rather nice having all land reachable anyway
2011-12-18T22:23:55  <dragonfyre13> janzert: that and I can imagine it would screw people doing very immature pathfinding up. Though that would likely be a lot of other things too
2011-12-18T22:24:01  <thestinger> BenJackson: well, they try to walk around my other ants
2011-12-18T22:24:03  <thestinger> that are in combat
2011-12-18T22:24:08  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-18T22:24:13  <BenJackson> I sort of do that
2011-12-18T22:24:20  <BenJackson> when I call for reinforcements I pick one end of the enemy ants

2011-12-18T22:24:25  <BenJackson> ...the end nearest my hills!
2011-12-18T22:24:35  <ChrisH_> thestinger: that's sounds like the same thing my bot does to form lines
2011-12-18T22:24:44  <amstan> janzert: is there a map.py check for that? my mapgen might produce some islands(if we end up using it)
2011-12-18T22:25:11  <thestinger> BenJackson: http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.213 it works, but it doesn't seem to help
2011-12-18T22:25:17  <thestinger> I think I'll just upload it anyway cause it's cool :)
2011-12-18T22:25:36  <ChrisH_> thestinger: I add some extra travel cost to each tile covered by one of my ant's attack zone, but only for ants used to attack enemy ants
2011-12-18T22:26:00  <BenJackson> does anyone else load random tcp replays and first check if THEY are also in the game and then check the graph to see the outcome?
2011-12-18T22:26:07  <thestinger> ChrisH_: yeah, that's basically exactly what I'm doing, but just for the tiles the ants are in (when they are near enemies)
2011-12-18T22:26:14  <thestinger> I'm going to make one final tweak
2011-12-18T22:26:18  <BenJackson> every time it's "oh shit I hope if I'm in that I didn't do something stupid"
2011-12-18T22:26:29  <dragonfyre13> just got spanked by torr15
2011-12-18T22:26:31  <dragonfyre13> is that good?
2011-12-18T22:26:38  <ChrisH_> thestinger: I also add an even higher cost to the tile the combat ants are on, but that applies for all of my ants
2011-12-18T22:26:42  <dragonfyre13> anyone in the room I guess I'm asking
2011-12-18T22:26:54  <BenJackson> never heard of torr15
2011-12-18T22:26:55  <besh> dragonfyre13: torr15 is strong
2011-12-18T22:27:03  <thestinger> ChrisH_: yeah I usually increment distance by +1, but +3 for a tile with ant, +6 for a tile with a combat ant
2011-12-18T22:27:11  <thestinger> a combat ant meaning one in a combat partition
2011-12-18T22:27:15  <dragonfyre13> besh: oh good. Was afraid I sucked. I scored at least. Took one of his hills
2011-12-18T22:27:31  <mcstar> 7636th
2011-12-18T22:27:40  <thestinger> so now I have a branch called newline :)
2011-12-18T22:28:10  <besh> I submitted with a +6 for paths through my ants and enemy ants as well. Not tested well but looks ok.
2011-12-18T22:28:17  <Extrarius> so, how do I get a "pull request" for my map generated?
2011-12-18T22:28:22  <BenJackson> I didn't figure pathing mattered because my reinforcements aren't trying to go through the line anyway
2011-12-18T22:28:23  <Extrarius> map generator
2011-12-18T22:28:37  <dragonfyre13> blarrrg I timed out on a very nice fight on bhickey
2011-12-18T22:28:44  <BenJackson> my explorers do finally cost around blockages
2011-12-18T22:28:50  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, you have all the fancy territory stuff implemented, I'm just trying to get proper combat to emerge as my ants head to enemy hills
2011-12-18T22:29:03  <a1k0n> the dart starter pack is buggy
2011-12-18T22:29:22  <a1k0n> takes sqrt of viewradius2, compares squared dist to it
2011-12-18T22:29:26  <BenJackson> thestinger: like I said, I reinforce the end near my hill to try to prevent the combat becoming unbalanced and twisting to let things by
2011-12-18T22:29:30  <BenJackson> I am sooo glad that's fixed
2011-12-18T22:29:31  <a1k0n> bit late to fix that
2011-12-18T22:29:42  <BenJackson> how many dart entries?
2011-12-18T22:29:46  <a1k0n> 2
2011-12-18T22:29:48  <besh> antimatroid: the server seems happy to have you on board.  You are getting games every 5 minutes or so.
2011-12-18T22:30:02  <a1k0n> 1 starter pack, one by starter pack author
2011-12-18T22:30:16  <BenJackson> starter pack author deserves what he gets I guess!
2011-12-18T22:30:20  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I flip flopped on having food and exploring ants avoid enemy ants, and decided to go with NOT avoiding because my defenses worked better that way.  But my hill destroying ants do avoid enemies and I've gotten some nice ninja action out of it.
2011-12-18T22:30:22  <a1k0n> heh yep

2011-12-18T22:31:03  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: but my own ants will block exploring ants, so they don't just pile up behind a wall of my own ants
2011-12-18T22:31:13  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: good ninja action was a feature of my earlier bots which perhaps I shuold have monitored more closely
2011-12-18T22:31:28  <antimatroid> besh: i think i'm back in the normal queue now though
2011-12-18T22:31:31  <mcstar> anyway guys, this talk is useless, i want CODE

2011-12-18T22:31:52  <mcstar> everyone can come up with these ideas, but not everyone can implement them
2011-12-18T22:31:56  <BenJackson> My Gpath template is so generic it's practically a bot building toolkit
2011-12-18T22:31:57  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yeah, I lost if for a few versions too, and when i got it back it definetly helped my bot score earlier in many games
2011-12-18T22:31:58  <dragonfyre13> oh god, the adderall is wearing off.... coding now is not going to be a good thing. Hope what I've got is good enough
2011-12-18T22:32:04  <avdg> meh, 90 shitty minutes for some I guess
2011-12-18T22:32:11  <BenJackson> takes two functors: a passability test and a per-square cost
2011-12-18T22:32:31  <mcstar> dragonfyre13: there are better drugs than adderral
2011-12-18T22:32:31  <ChrisH_> nice
2011-12-18T22:32:32  <avdg> (hmm, I should be careful with my words)
2011-12-18T22:32:55  <besh> antimatroid: your last three games are 1 minute apart. I think it will keep on going until your rank stabilizes. (mu = 91)
2011-12-18T22:33:00  <dragonfyre13> mcstar: this one was actually perscribed for ADD though. Fully aware there's better out there, but this one works for daily use.
2011-12-18T22:33:01  <ChrisH_> my pathing code is pretty generic as well
2011-12-18T22:33:10  <Antimony> ok hopefully final submission done!
2011-12-18T22:33:10  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I'm realizing too late that I really should have special case code for fighting someone over a 3rd party's hill
2011-12-18T22:33:16  <mcstar> dragonfyre13: have you tried modafiniL?
2011-12-18T22:33:20  <BenJackson> my bot doesn't distinguish
2011-12-18T22:33:31  <dragonfyre13> nope, but gonna look it up in a sec
2011-12-18T22:33:31  <antimatroid> besh: it's been a while now though, and it says i'm back in queue
2011-12-18T22:33:43  <BenJackson> but two evenly matched bots with a slightly weaker guy between them will often interact right at the enemy hill
2011-12-18T22:33:51  <dragonfyre13> derivative?
2011-12-18T22:34:19  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I had that implemented but it is commented out because my code structure made it hard to tell which enemy owned the ants in a hypothetical future combat state, so my bot thought almost all enemy ants were about to take down their own hills.  :(
2011-12-18T22:34:26  <mcstar> no
2011-12-18T22:34:36  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: and i didn't have time to rework that part of my data structures to make it possible

2011-12-18T22:35:55  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: but my combat code does work very hard to wedge my ants into a position to get the hill and it has been working pretty well in those situations, so I'm not to upset about that lack of feature
2011-12-18T22:36:03  <dragonfyre13> oh yeah, definately my final version of code. My little dudes are acting like they have a modicom of intelligence. http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.42429

2011-12-18T22:37:52  <janzert> antimatroid: a reddit post would be fine with me but there won't be anything to see for a while
2011-12-18T22:37:53  <dragonfyre13> k, maybe someone can tell me how to save a competition?
2011-12-18T22:37:54  <antimatroid> amstan: only if i can still watch my games!

2011-12-18T22:38:31  <thestinger> so... my bot really can't kill itself
2011-12-18T22:38:38  <thestinger> one has 750 ants, the other has 530
2011-12-18T22:38:42  <thestinger> oh, it's ending now
2011-12-18T22:38:49  <BenJackson> antimatroid: hey we just played together on the real site
2011-12-18T22:38:58  <antimatroid> yeah, you owned me :P
2011-12-18T22:39:35  <BenJackson> you were definitely the 2nd strongest but took no points
2011-12-18T22:39:44  <janzert> hmm, McLeopold last change for checking hill placement legality is broken
2011-12-18T22:39:45  <BenJackson> time for last minute tuning ;-)
2011-12-18T22:39:59  <antimatroid> BenJackson: don't tempt me :P
2011-12-18T22:40:00  <dragonfyre13> wow, ok. The aichallenge site is hella fast right now.
2011-12-18T22:40:15  <BenJackson> dragonfyre13: I know, I'm sure it means something quit running
2011-12-18T22:40:25  <antimatroid> BenJackson: who your neighbours are can make a big difference
2011-12-18T22:40:28  <BenJackson> in a sec it will turn out no more matchups are being generated or something
2011-12-18T22:40:34  <antimatroid> i just want top 30 now :)
2011-12-18T22:40:40  <avdg> my bot has to play a game very soon, probably th elast one
2011-12-18T22:40:43  <BenJackson> antimatroid: yeah I don't recognize any of those players besides you
2011-12-18T22:40:43  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: yeah, unfortunately. That or they put 1 of thier search algorithm clusters on it... :D

2011-12-18T22:42:01  <thestinger> alright, the sha1sums match, I was actually testing the right version this time :)
2011-12-18T22:42:04  <BenJackson> antimatroid: watch orange on that game
2011-12-18T22:42:07  <ChrisH_> i recognize boreus and r-bit
2011-12-18T22:42:19  <BenJackson> he's got static defenses and dark green gets very close
2011-12-18T22:42:25  <antimatroid> amstan: second time in a row you left Google out of the title :P
2011-12-18T22:42:37  * avdg likes the 100% likes it (only 1 vote) system
2011-12-18T22:42:39  <ChrisH_> r-bit used to slot in just below me in the early days and we had many games
2011-12-18T22:42:45  <BenJackson> then around turn 635 I show up and pick them apart with 4 ants
2011-12-18T22:43:21  <thestinger> there, my final reupload
2011-12-18T22:43:26  <amstan> antimatroid: the title doesn't have google anymore
2011-12-18T22:43:31  <amstan> it's intentional
2011-12-18T22:43:41  <antimatroid> sponsored by
2011-12-18T22:43:57  <amstan> that would be too long of a title
2011-12-18T22:44:44  <thestinger> I should save the diff of the last change so I can remember not to make a stupid change like this at the last minute when it does horribly
2011-12-18T22:45:03  <antimatroid> BenJackson: ah well, i'm not changing anything now
2011-12-18T22:45:09  <ChrisH_> thestinger: what did you change?
2011-12-18T22:45:15  <antimatroid> i used to just push enemies away from my hills from the start
2011-12-18T22:45:19  <antimatroid> but it was such a waste of ants
2011-12-18T22:45:36  <antimatroid> so now i just move an ant towards a hill if necessary then push them away later if i still h ave ants to move
2011-12-18T22:45:47  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I think you did pretty well, really.  neither of us took hills proportional to our "skills" in that game
2011-12-18T22:45:52  <thestinger> ChrisH_: changed the constants used for getting the lines to form :)
2011-12-18T22:45:57  <BenJackson> ChrisH is much better at mopping up points
2011-12-18T22:46:20  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: where did that come from?
2011-12-18T22:46:43  <BenJackson> that wasn't TO you, just part of what I was saying to antimatroid
2011-12-18T22:46:50  <thestinger> +2 and +4 instead of +3 and +6

2011-12-18T22:49:07  <thestinger> just no time to see if it's really an improvement over strcat_line
2011-12-18T22:49:17  <BenJackson> still not strcat_final?
2011-12-18T22:49:34  <BenJackson> that was thwr ong map for testing that for sure
2011-12-18T22:49:39  <BenJackson> no lines formed for the most part
2011-12-18T22:49:59  <thestinger> lol, yeah
2011-12-18T22:50:18  <thestinger> well, strcat is supposed to the be the version I have on the site - so that's the 'final' one
2011-12-18T22:50:23  <BenJackson> http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.239?turn=539
2011-12-18T22:50:24  <thestinger> atm _newline is what I have on the site
2011-12-18T22:50:28  <BenJackson> a line formed there, but I don't think it was due to pathing
2011-12-18T22:50:36  <BenJackson> and it got pnwed
2011-12-18T22:51:06  <avdg> hmm, it looks like that I can reach the top 1500, but I need a bit luck for that
2011-12-18T22:51:09  <BenJackson> you need something inside yoru combat that holds the line as well
2011-12-18T22:51:21  <BenJackson> even after making some bad moves that line was ok until it scattered
2011-12-18T22:51:44  <thestinger> yeah, they prefer to just go eat
2011-12-18T22:51:56  <thestinger> my bot is based off that hedonismbot experiment
2011-12-18T22:52:03  <thestinger> eating is what it does best

2011-12-18T22:54:36  <hacklash> when you do see a players ant it has anumber, as far as I can tell. Are those in order (my ants are A0, next players are a1, etc)? or do they skip (mine A0 and the only other visible ant is A2)?
2011-12-18T22:54:41  <BenJackson> hacklash: the server goes out of its way to keep you in the dark
2011-12-18T22:54:52  <BenJackson> the first enemy you see will be 1
2011-12-18T22:54:53  <BenJackson> then 2, etc
2011-12-18T22:54:56  <BenJackson> no matter what order
2011-12-18T22:55:02  <hacklash> persistent across turns?

2011-12-18T22:55:22  <hacklash> ok, very cool thanks
2011-12-18T22:55:29  <BenJackson> as soon as you see an enemy it assigns a number for you

2011-12-18T22:56:44  <BenJackson> it should be noted that any idea I can think of for truly estimating number of player is way too complex to do in the next hour :)
2011-12-18T22:56:58  <thestinger> http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.248?turn=418&row=54&col=2 I deserve a peacekeeping award for this

2011-12-18T22:57:04  <jaman4dbz> I noticed I still had this chat up. Interesting to see some people still trying to throw in last minute things. I recently realized my next change is too large to add in time, so I've given up. Good luck to you people.
2011-12-18T22:57:07  <antimatroid> there's a few simple ones

2011-12-18T22:57:26  <antimatroid> maybe a bit messy in an hour i guess
2011-12-18T22:57:29  <jaman4dbz> that is awesome stinger
2011-12-18T22:58:10  <BenJackson> then at turn 655 strcat's peacekeeping effort suffers mission creep
2011-12-18T22:58:18  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: nice.
2011-12-18T22:58:19  <BenJackson> then the warring factions eat him alive
2011-12-18T22:59:25  <thestinger> my combat was probably saying "we're all going to die!" for that whole thing

2011-12-18T23:09:35  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: well, it still won 14-4. And I don't know why! It just happens to walk in on undefended bases. I can't really explain why this old bot is 10 mu higher than the new one on both TCP servers
2011-12-18T23:09:42  <avdg> and every ant tries to pull outside

2011-12-18T23:10:30  <thestinger> bmh: your tcp server was a life saver :P
2011-12-18T23:10:42  <bmh> thestinger: don't thank me, just send cash ;)
2011-12-18T23:10:54  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: checkout turn 100 - 120. You take mine while I'm focused on yours (already lost my other one)
2011-12-18T23:11:01  <Vaenom> no, I'm testing it right now. I can see the others (Vaenom_ )  but not this one.  I need to pick one to submit for the contest and E2 was what seemed the best to me, but wanted to comfirm
2011-12-18T23:11:11  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: you just walk right up behind me and snatch it, I don't even notice...

2011-12-18T23:11:46  <besh> Migi32: bhickey match making is not good. If you don't have bugs and the new one is better head to head i would prefer the new one.
2011-12-18T23:11:50  <thestinger> http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.274 seems to somewhat work
2011-12-18T23:12:00  <bmh> Vaenom: go for it. 'fraid I didn't write the server

2011-12-18T23:13:27  <avdg> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=8660 <- poor bot
2011-12-18T23:13:42  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: pretty much from the start of the game, I keep defending (quite effectively if I do say so) against everyone on the board. WIth a handful of ants. Against veritable hoards sometimes.....
2011-12-18T23:14:08  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: but that might be kinda exaggerating a bit.
2011-12-18T23:14:14  <avdg> * http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=273570&user=8660
2011-12-18T23:14:42  <bmh> Vaenom: I was under the impression that tcpants is on fire
2011-12-18T23:14:52  <Vaenom> antimatroid: yep, that's what I'll do
2011-12-18T23:15:02  <Vaenom> bmh: it seems
2011-12-18T23:15:09  <antimatroid> i want more server games :(
2011-12-18T23:16:06  <besh> what happens at 0:00:00 ?
2011-12-18T23:16:09  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: yeah, not bad. But for example on turn 140 you defend your base in the middle very nicely, then on turn 150 if all enemies are dead you just walk away
2011-12-18T23:16:33  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: and on turn 160, there's a lone enemy ant wandering by :)
2011-12-18T23:16:36  <besh> will santa say "let the games begin" or something :)
2011-12-18T23:16:45  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: yeah, there's not really any defense code in there....

2011-12-18T23:17:13  <Migi32> yup :)
2011-12-18T23:17:17  <janzert> So here's a list of the current maps that are illegal http://pastebin.com/5GihjTXg
2011-12-18T23:17:19  <a1k0n> i wonder why the rankings on fluxid are so unrepresentative compared to the official contest
2011-12-18T23:17:29  <janzert> anyone see any others that were missed by the current checks
2011-12-18T23:17:33  <a1k0n> i guess the matches go differently without matchmaking
2011-12-18T23:18:12  <ChrisH_> and a lot more timeouts
2011-12-18T23:18:30  <ChrisH_> in addition, not everyone has the same computing resources when running on their own machines
2011-12-18T23:18:44  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: but hey, my ant's combat logic was very, very confused by you here: http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.270?turn=461
2011-12-18T23:19:00  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: watch a couple more turns. You move one space, and they all move in at once.
2011-12-18T23:19:37  <Migi32> hmm that page isn't loading for me...

2011-12-18T23:23:24  <bmh> I'm going to eat dinner, if it explodes uh.. call a1k0n and tell him to drive to my house :-P
2011-12-18T23:23:27  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: darn. I just figured out how to do the defense code....
2011-12-18T23:24:01  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: you have 35 more minutes :)
2011-12-18T23:24:05  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: yeah, I never had time to implement proper defense
2011-12-18T23:24:08  <QuirionPt> a1k0n, I was implementing something similar to your algorithm for combat
2011-12-18T23:24:09  <dragonfyre13> Antimony: Mine are mostly "this is stupid" "pay no attention to this" "bad form" or "try not to step on yourself with this"
2011-12-18T23:24:29  <thestinger> my proper defense code basically sorted all enemy ants my distance to my hills
2011-12-18T23:24:31  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: I'm getting to work.... don't worry.
2011-12-18T23:24:35  <thestinger> then assigned ants to block the path to my hill
2011-12-18T23:24:35  <bmh> (pro-tip: he doesn't know where I live)
2011-12-18T23:24:39  <a1k0n> QuirionPt: it sorta works, though i think more deterministic methods are better
2011-12-18T23:24:50  <a1k0n> that's what you thik
2011-12-18T23:24:56  <QuirionPt> a1k0n, but using some "bias" to attempt to make them move together

2011-12-18T23:25:27  <thestinger> and... I've killed strcat_line
2011-12-18T23:25:50  <a1k0n> i want to see strcat_live, which is just him playing by hand
2011-12-18T23:25:57  <thestinger> that would be neat

2011-12-18T23:26:44  <thestinger> and combat/movement is done by the bot
2011-12-18T23:26:45  <mcstar> you place koreans

2011-12-18T23:27:29  <thestinger> antimatroid: 500ms :)
2011-12-18T23:27:31  <antimatroid> i could kick my planet wars bots ass
2011-12-18T23:27:33  <anarrr> hi folks, whether anybody knows jvm params used for bots on oficial servers?
2011-12-18T23:27:34  <antimatroid> my tron bot would kick my ass
2011-12-18T23:27:35  <mcstar> come on bots finish turns in miliseconds
2011-12-18T23:27:50  <a1k0n> mine doesn't
2011-12-18T23:27:55  <antimatroid> assuming i had an extended turn limit
2011-12-18T23:27:56  <besh> Hmm that is tough. I think as long as he wishes
2011-12-18T23:28:02  <Migi32> besh: I wonder about this, and for planets wars too. Could we humans beat xathis (or bocsimacko)?

2011-12-18T23:28:18  <besh> it will be tiresome to move all your ants
2011-12-18T23:28:27  <mcstar> you have to ask whether the human is aided, and how much time he has
2011-12-18T23:28:29  <thestinger> a1k0n: I tried that :)
2011-12-18T23:28:34  <antimatroid> planet wars had ridiculously complicated scenarios even with just 3 planets

2011-12-18T23:29:11  <Migi32> mcstar: no aids, no time limit (well, the practical limit of how much time you *want* to put in it).
2011-12-18T23:29:22  <antimatroid> mcstar; and?
2011-12-18T23:29:39  <mcstar> antimatroid: maybe you can get used to it like leaning chess

2011-12-18T23:40:51  <amstan> Extrarius: pull request..

2011-12-18T23:40:58  <McLeopold> janzert: also, for the matchmaking, I'd like to just backup the tables and clean them out

2011-12-18T23:42:10  <antimatroid> Extrarius: the maps are cool, but it's way too close to the deadline to introduce a new map gen
2011-12-18T23:42:16  <McLeopold> My idea would be to move the data to a secondary table while finals are running, then move the data back
2011-12-18T23:42:26  <antimatroid> people write their bots testing on specific types of maps
2011-12-18T23:42:37  <antimatroid> 20 minutes before the deadline is not sufficient time to test :P
2011-12-18T23:42:57  <rebelxt> janzert: sorry if this has been asked many times, when do you guys plan to start the tourney?
2011-12-18T23:43:06  <janzert> That has such a huge potential to accidentally break or lose something, that really scares me
2011-12-18T23:43:08  <Extrarius> antimatroid: Doesn't that make a good test of who created good AI instead of just a hack that happens to work?
2011-12-18T23:43:19  <thestinger> janzert: I've just tweaked constants today :)
2011-12-18T23:43:20  <amstan> rebelxt: midnight+epsilon
2011-12-18T23:43:27  <rebelxt> antimatroid: did you submit?
2011-12-18T23:43:32  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: cutting it close, but the code is testing on the tcp servers now. Passes the unittests though'
2011-12-18T23:43:35  <rebelxt> amstan: great, thanks ;-)
2011-12-18T23:43:39  <janzert> thestinger: my last comment was to McLeopold
2011-12-18T23:43:40  <antimatroid> Extrarius: "good ai" is a very ill defined term, there has to be limits to what peole can expect
2011-12-18T23:43:46  <amstan> Extrarius: yes, but people complain a lot, so..
2011-12-18T23:43:48  <thestinger> janzert: oh xD
2011-12-18T23:43:54  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: oh, unit tests? nice :)
2011-12-18T23:43:54  <antimatroid> it's been made fairly clear by the majority of people that they prefer to have tested with the map gen
2011-12-18T23:43:58  <Extrarius> well, here is my map gen if anybody wants to play with it: http://pastebin.com/2pgD8mj2

2011-12-18T23:44:29  <avdg> anyone some thoughts about the last 15 minutes?
2011-12-18T23:44:29  <janzert> rebelxt: we'll be getting the finals going after submissions close but will probably take a few hours
2011-12-18T23:44:30  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: defense is now VERY rudimentary, but it's kinda there. At least one won't slip in behind me while I walk away. If I'm engaged elsewhere I probably won't care though....
2011-12-18T23:44:36  <antimatroid> Extrarius: stick around when the next game is being made and you can make map gens for that
2011-12-18T23:44:45  <antimatroid> and whatever else picks your fancy
2011-12-18T23:44:52  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Needed the unit tests to make sure I didn't screw up the logic messing with something
2011-12-18T23:44:58  <thestinger> avdg: srand(42), then use rand() for everything
2011-12-18T23:45:16  <McLeopold> janzert: how many maps do you want of each type?  I'm thinking around 50?
2011-12-18T23:45:18  <bmh> ok, my server looks alive.
2011-12-18T23:45:21  <Extrarius> antimatroid: yeah, I would have had a reasonable bot and an awesome map generator if only I'd found out about this whole thing any time other than right before I moved =-/
2011-12-18T23:45:30  <antimatroid> bmh: want to put some more maps on your server?
2011-12-18T23:45:31  <McLeopold> janzert: the 3 types being, maze, cell_maze and random_walk
2011-12-18T23:45:35  <bmh> antimatroid: no.
2011-12-18T23:45:38  <janzert> McLeopold: how many types are there now? I was thinking around 150 to 200 total

2011-12-18T23:46:55  <Migi32> heh, I don't think the universe likes me. As the deadline draws closer and closer, the difference in rating between my old version and my new version becomes smaller and smaller :)
2011-12-18T23:47:04  <Migi32> still not resubmitting with my new version though
2011-12-18T23:47:09  <antimatroid> rebelxt: i want to a.) get first in aus again (seems tougher this year) and b.) improve on my previous ranking :)
2011-12-18T23:47:13  <Extrarius> is it correct that you won't be releasing bot's code after the contest?
2011-12-18T23:47:16  <McLeopold> janzert: okay, I'm heads down generating maps

2011-12-18T23:56:22  <dragonfyre13> Extrarius: your generator doesn't allow for 1 wide hallways does it? (where they deadend after a while in water)
2011-12-18T23:56:24  <avdg> its like 50 in the last 10 min
2011-12-18T23:56:27  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: oh it was specifically designed against me? :)
2011-12-18T23:56:27  <UncleVasya> Bom! Bom! Bom! 12:00 O'Clock,. happy Deadline :D
2011-12-18T23:56:28  <rebelxt> old proven bot vs new fancy but buggy bot - who wants to make a call? ;-)

2011-12-18T23:56:50  <avdg> make it 60
2011-12-18T23:56:54  <Extrarius> dragonfyre13: Not as written. Because of the '3x3 passage' rule, I make my worms have a minimum diameter of 2.5 units
2011-12-18T23:56:55  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Well, to protect against ants like yours. Sneaky little bastards.
2011-12-18T23:57:02  <Vaenom> Andddddddd... Uploaded  :)
2011-12-18T23:57:09  <dragonfyre13> Extrarius: that's good. I "smooth" the water a bit...

2011-12-18T23:57:29  <praveen_> rebelxt: old proven bot
2011-12-18T23:57:35  <Extrarius> yeah, mine roughs up the map then smooths it to make the results a little 'more interesting'
2011-12-18T23:57:37  <Murashka> pguillory not resubmit strange
2011-12-18T23:57:40  <dragonfyre13> Extrarius: If a cell is water on 3 sides, I ignore that cell. Sometimes screws things up, but means I don't back into a "stupid cell"
2011-12-18T23:57:45  <avdg> heh http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=273965
2011-12-18T23:58:04  <Antimony> avdg where do you find the submission number?
2011-12-18T23:58:10  <rebelxt> praveen_: agreed... even though it's a bit weeker
2011-12-18T23:58:11  <avdg> server stats
2011-12-18T23:58:20  <avdg> and time ;-)
2011-12-18T23:58:21  <Extrarius> theoretically the rough/smoothing step could produce a cell with water on 3 sides, but it isn't very likely

2011-12-18T23:58:57  <Extrarius> so how do I get into the 'core group' that runs the contests so I get a heads up and can work on the starter kit for the next contest announcement?

2011-12-18T23:59:26  <a1k0n> Extrarius: follow the top part of the forum
2011-12-18T23:59:36  <avdg> hmm 80 in the last 15 min
2011-12-18T23:59:48  <avdg> count down
2011-12-18T23:59:51  <avdg> 10
2011-12-18T23:59:52  <dragonfyre13> avdg: wow. I'm pretty sure someone beat someone there, but for the life of me I can't figure out who won that god awful fight.
