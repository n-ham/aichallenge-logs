2011-04-08T01:36:33  <antimatroid> re allowing bots to write to file in the final contest
2011-04-08T01:36:47  <antimatroid> the ranking algorithm assumes the bots have constant "ability" yeah?
2011-04-08T01:36:55  <antimatroid> janzert: ^?
2011-04-08T01:37:33  <janzert> no the ranking algorithm does fine with varying ability
2011-04-08T01:37:34  <amstan> it does?
2011-04-08T01:37:38  <amstan> yeah
2011-04-08T01:37:58  <janzert> there are huge technical hurdles to make file writing work though
2011-04-08T01:38:21  <janzert> since a bot plays games on different workers, possibly simultaneously
2011-04-08T01:38:49  <janzert> well... huge might be exaggerating a bit
2011-04-08T01:39:09  <antimatroid> i don't see what people would need to write to file that they couldn't already have done locally
2011-04-08T01:39:44  <amstan> antimatroid: it could make true learning bots
2011-04-08T01:39:54  <amstan> without having the need to reupload
2011-04-08T01:40:08  <antimatroid> you are really going to want to do that on tcp anyway
2011-04-08T01:40:13  <antimatroid> then just once it's "trained" upload
2011-04-08T01:40:28  <janzert> yeah, I believe what they are wanting is a way to let the bot learn independently
2011-04-08T01:40:36  <amstan> idk, if people want to make it cool like that, they should
2011-04-08T01:41:08  <janzert> but I think it is much over rated to have it for the bot after upload
2011-04-08T01:41:15  <antimatroid> so if someone beat bocsi last contest near the start, later it wouldn't have counted as though they beat the best bot?
2011-04-08T01:41:35  <antimatroid> because at the time bocsi wasn't considered to be of the ability of the best bot
2011-04-08T01:42:26  <antimatroid> or at least, with trueskill if bayeslo did assume constant ability
2011-04-08T01:42:32  <antimatroid> otherwise i'm not really sure how it works :s
2011-04-08T01:43:03  <janzert> bayeselo does make an assumption of constant ability
2011-04-08T01:43:32  <antimatroid> so if with trueskill you beat the best bot at the start, you wouldn't get the real gain of beating the best bot?
2011-04-08T01:43:33  <antimatroid> i don't like that
2011-04-08T01:44:38  <antimatroid> imo that's almost like saying all past game data is not as useful as current data, because the bots are no longer the same

2011-04-08T02:01:28  <sigh> janzert: so if they are allowed to write to disk, won't that violate that assumption?
2011-04-08T02:01:45  <antimatroid> what sigh said
2011-04-08T02:01:53  <janzert> yes, we would need to make a small change in the way we are using trueskill
2011-04-08T02:02:01  <janzert> but that is probably a line or two of code
2011-04-08T02:02:09  <antimatroid> but do we want to drop that assumption?
2011-04-08T02:02:13  <janzert> and trivial compared to the rest of making it work
2011-04-08T02:02:30  <antimatroid> i would say most bots are going to be of constant ability in the finals
2011-04-08T02:02:43  <janzert> if it's invalid ;)

2011-04-08T02:09:38  <antimatroid> ergh my internet is annoying
2011-04-08T02:09:46  <antimatroid> but does the benefit of allowing people to write to files in the finals outweigh the cost of dropping the assumption?
2011-04-08T02:10:08  <antimatroid> that is my biggest reservation about allowing file writing in the actual contest
2011-04-08T02:11:35  <janzert> my thought is that the cost of implementing it isn't offset by the benefit it brings, so I'm not giving much thought about how to make the rankings work with it
2011-04-08T02:12:29  <janzert> there are too many technical hurdles to do it and we already are having a hard time reaching the finish line of an up and running contest

2011-04-08T02:21:37  <sigh> if anything, just give people read access... although that doesn't give anyone the ability to do anything they couldn't already
2011-04-08T02:22:15  <janzert> yeah, they already are allowed to read anything they upload with the bot
2011-04-08T02:26:19  <antimatroid> janzert: i agree, i was just trying to clarify what exactly the implications were :)
2011-04-08T02:54:15  <Keth> What happens if a bot creates a seperate thread?
2011-04-08T02:54:24  <Keth> and messes stuff up?
2011-04-08T02:55:36  <janzert> the bots have a hard limit in the OS on creating threads
2011-04-08T02:55:39  <Keth> I'm kind of afraid of enemy bots cheating in number of ways like running away, crashing the engine, creating tcp connections or like 1000 threads
2011-04-08T02:55:49  <Keth> e.g. all of those things can be done bot detects "I'm losing"
2011-04-08T02:56:02  <Keth> when bot*
2011-04-08T02:56:19  <janzert> that's what the sandbox is meant to prevent
2011-04-08T02:56:29  <Keth> by sandbox you mean the engine?
2011-04-08T02:56:35  <janzert> no
2011-04-08T02:56:46  <Keth> What does sandbox do?
2011-04-08T02:56:48  <janzert> the bots are basically run in a restricted environment
2011-04-08T02:57:34  <Keth> And what the approach briefly would be?
2011-04-08T02:58:20  <janzert> quite a few things are combined but basically not allowing it to access or use resources it shouldn't
2011-04-08T02:58:42  <Keth> i see
2011-04-08T02:59:38  <janzert> it's almost certainly not perfect and a concern is of course that bot finds a way to do something it shouldn't, fortunately so far no has done that
2011-04-08T03:00:07  <Keth> yeah I see
2011-04-08T03:01:04  <antimatroid> if a lot of bots were crashing to a specific bot, it would be looked at, and the bot potentially thrown out of the contest
2011-04-08T03:01:26  <antimatroid> if they were purposely doing something to crash other bots etc.
2011-04-08T03:01:57  <antimatroid> there are no longer draconian rules like disqualification if you timeout in the final contest
2011-04-08T03:02:05  <antimatroid> that happened to me in tron D: i will never forget
2011-04-08T03:02:43  <janzert> I did throw one submission out last year that accidently crashed the workers, I think it was trying to include and build the whole haskell runtime if I remember right
2011-04-08T03:05:17  <sigh> why would they do that?
2011-04-08T03:05:31  <janzert> he wanted a different version than we had
2011-04-08T03:05:36  <sigh> haha
2011-04-08T03:06:07  <janzert> I probably stated it wrong above, I mean he was building haskell from scratch
2011-04-08T03:06:47  <janzert> of course compilation also wasn't sandboxed then so this wasn't a break out from the sandbox
2011-04-08T03:07:29  <sigh> what's happening in regard to compilation in this contest?
2011-04-08T03:08:02  <janzert> it's been a while but I think McLeopold may have already sandboxed it
2011-04-08T03:08:29  <janzert> it has been moved solely to the workers I know
2011-04-08T03:08:41  <sigh> ahhh
2011-04-08T03:09:36  <sigh> I think McLeopold has made an issue with your name on it regarding that
2011-04-08T03:09:49  <sigh> well, regarding jails and workers
2011-04-08T03:10:07  <janzert> I think that is the addition of chroot to the sandbox process
2011-04-08T03:10:19  <sigh> i see
2011-04-08T03:10:38  <janzert> yeah, looks like
2011-04-08T03:11:24  <janzert> hmm, I do see that "sandboxed compilation" issue is still open though
2011-04-08T03:11:47  <sigh> a lot of stuff is open
2011-04-08T03:12:15  <sigh> hmm... I'm going to close the leap second issue as WONTFIX so it feels like I

2011-04-08T07:42:41  <antimatroid> and i can collapse all of their nodes into one layer
2011-04-08T07:43:19  <antimatroid> my bot wouldn't be able to cooperate then

2011-04-08T07:44:25  <antimatroid> are you willing to assume that in ants?
2011-04-08T07:44:42  <antimatroid> like when evaluating what might happen with your turns, are you willing to assume the other players will do what is best for them?
2011-04-08T07:44:54  <antimatroid> there is a neat alternative backward induction you can use if you are willing to assume that
2011-04-08T07:45:01  <antimatroid> which is different to actual nash equilibria
2011-04-08T07:45:17  <antimatroid> i was originally going to do my thesis based off that last idea, but then this gsoc thing came up
2011-04-08T07:45:22  <sigh> assume that they are or aren't rational?
2011-04-08T07:45:54  <antimatroid> if you assume they are, then when doing backward induction, each player will bring up their best possible payoff, while every other player will always pull up their worst
2011-04-08T07:46:10  <sigh> yeah
2011-04-08T07:46:44  <antimatroid> normally you pull up the worst of the drawing best for the player
2011-04-08T07:48:13  <sigh> hmm... reddit is down
2011-04-08T07:49:14  <antimatroid> reddit gets more awful every week
2011-04-08T07:49:29  <sigh> content or uptime?
2011-04-08T07:49:47  <antimatroid> content
2011-04-08T07:49:59  <antimatroid> and more youtube quality comments
2011-04-08T07:50:25  <sigh> yeah, that's been happening for a while though
2011-04-08T07:51:04  <antimatroid> it always happens
2011-04-08T07:51:07  <antimatroid> it always has happened
2011-04-08T07:51:10  <antimatroid> since before the internet
2011-04-08T07:51:12  <antimatroid> i hate it though
2011-04-08T07:51:20  <antimatroid> it makes me rage :P
2011-04-08T07:51:22  <sigh> eternal september :P

2011-04-08T07:52:01  <antimatroid> i was born in september
2011-04-08T07:52:27  <antimatroid> oh, cause that's when america starts back from summer vacation?
2011-04-08T07:52:39  <sigh> yup
2011-04-08T07:52:39  <antimatroid> ah, should have kept reading
2011-04-08T07:52:42  <antimatroid> yeah i hate that time of year

2011-04-08T07:53:11  <sigh> well, that was a quick change of heart
2011-04-08T07:53:28  <antimatroid> i'm flexible with my opinions
2011-04-08T07:53:35  <sigh> :)
2011-04-08T07:53:37  <antimatroid> except for battle

2011-04-08T07:55:51  <sigh> I think I have :)
2011-04-08T07:55:53  <antimatroid> i don't often go on those things, but that one is mega
2011-04-08T07:56:21  <sigh> :)
2011-04-08T07:57:07  <antimatroid> i think i've worked out my macro strategy
2011-04-08T07:57:18  <antimatroid> now i just need to implement it and iron out all the micro
2011-04-08T07:57:18  <sigh> kill everyone?
2011-04-08T07:57:37  <antimatroid> nah, i think i'm going to try and avoid battles unless the kill/death ratio > 1
2011-04-08T07:57:57  <antimatroid> then i need to play around with then appropriate time to reduce that back to 1
2011-04-08T07:58:08  <sigh> you want more kills than deaths? o_O
2011-04-08T07:58:13  <antimatroid> >=1 that is
2011-04-08T07:58:19  <antimatroid> yes, for multiplayer near the start
2011-04-08T07:58:53  <sigh> by death I guess you mean your own bots
2011-04-08T07:58:59  <sigh> that makes a bit more sense
2011-04-08T07:58:59  <antimatroid> 1. collect food (using heuristics), 2. search non-battle ants incrementally from all locations at once 3. game tree for battles
2011-04-08T07:59:17  <antimatroid> yep

2011-04-08T13:38:32  <janzert> I'm not sure why the timer call is used, but all it does is delay the start of the input thread by 1 second. The input is read continuously after that and operates correctly.

2011-04-08T18:21:31  <ahmedhelal> amstan: k so it either, 1- not to offer games data any more and just have an archive of the problem statement, ranking list.           2- keep all current stuff along with the db and just move it to a sub domain, and have a new separate db for the new contest.
2011-04-08T18:21:43  <ahmedhelal> it's*
2011-04-08T18:21:50  <amstan> ahmedhelal: 1 is not cool
2011-04-08T18:22:04  <amstan> 2 is .. simple but ... might break in the future, it's a delicate setup
2011-04-08T18:22:17  <amstan> 3 will be future proof, but it'll take some work to convert
2011-04-08T18:22:25  <ahmedhelal> exactly
2011-04-08T18:22:25  <amstan> 3 as in... make a static copy of the website
2011-04-08T18:22:51  <ahmedhelal> yeah i get it, but it will take more work than creating the new website for the new contest, which isnt fair :)
2011-04-08T18:23:16  <amstan> also.. 2 might require some cpu
2011-04-08T18:23:21  <amstan> for looking in the database and stuff
2011-04-08T18:23:30  <amstan> 3 is faster
2011-04-08T18:23:46  <ahmedhelal> shouldnt, as ppl would be more interested in the latest contest
2011-04-08T18:23:54  <jbroman> amstan: That's less of a concern than the fragility because archived copies won't be accessed that much.
2011-04-08T18:23:56  <amstan> ok, i guess so
2011-04-08T18:24:03  <ahmedhelal> for instance if you check the visits for the challenge right before planet wars,  i believe not too much traffic would be in there
2011-04-08T18:24:22  <amstan> jbroman: yes.. but i imagine us updating php or whatever, and then the archived copy breaks
2011-04-08T18:24:28  <amstan> or it needs new db access
2011-04-08T18:24:32  <jbroman> amstan: Yeah, that's the fragility.
2011-04-08T18:24:46  <jbroman> The CPU power is not the concern.
2011-04-08T18:24:49  <amstan> oh.. right, ok
2011-04-08T18:25:03  <amstan> still fragility will make it annoying to get 2
2011-04-08T18:25:14  <ahmedhelal> amstan: why would it be touched anyway ?, i mean why dont you  totally separate between the file system and the db of the old challenge and the new one
2011-04-08T18:25:34  <jbroman> ahmedhelal: If you mean a separate instance, it costs money.

2011-04-08T18:25:42  <amstan> jbroman: we could vm it
2011-04-08T18:25:56  <ahmedhelal> jbroman: for hosting fees, etc ?
2011-04-08T18:25:59  <jbroman> amstan: You'd also have to reverse-proxy HTTP requests.
2011-04-08T18:26:11  <amstan> nah.. just use a subdomain
2011-04-08T18:26:22  <jbroman> amstan: Even with a subdomain.
2011-04-08T18:26:33  <jbroman> unless it has a separate public IP
2011-04-08T18:26:39  <amstan> yeah, ok, you're right
2011-04-08T18:26:46  <jbroman> (EC2, for instance, will not allocate >1 public IPs/instance.)
2011-04-08T18:27:17  <amstan> well, archiving them statically is a lot of work, and i don't think anybody wants to do that
2011-04-08T18:27:35  <amstan> so we might as well make sure we get all the data to run it(before it's lost) and have something up already
2011-04-08T18:28:41  <amstan> jbroman: speaking of lost data... any idea where the db for http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~j3camero/contest/fall2009/results.php is at?
2011-04-08T18:29:07  <amstan> jeff might know.. but you're syscom, you could look around
2011-04-08T18:33:09  <jbroman> amstan: I'm pretty sure it's either contest or contest2 on caffeine.

2011-04-08T18:33:50  <jbroman> If Jeff wants to, I can probably grab an SQL dump.
2011-04-08T18:34:18  <amstan> well.. you know jeff these days
2011-04-08T18:39:43  <jbroman> Actually, looks like it's running out of j3camero's own DB.
2011-04-08T18:39:49  <jbroman> Assuming mysql_login.php is correct.
2011-04-08T18:40:07  <amstan> jbroman: it is, but i think there's a login problem or something
2011-04-08T18:40:10  <amstan> check the http error logs
2011-04-08T18:40:17  <amstan> or the db doesn't exist anymore
2011-04-08T18:40:25  <amstan> which would suck
2011-04-08T18:40:29  <amstan> it worked a few months ago
2011-04-08T18:42:12  <jbroman> Yeah, tables are gone from j3camero.
2011-04-08T18:42:44  <amstan> well.. that's annoying
2011-04-08T18:44:37  <ahmedhelal> amstan: i think i have a found  away to archive the stored games
2011-04-08T18:44:47  <amstan> ahmedhelal: ok?
2011-04-08T18:45:04  <ahmedhelal> amstan: let me go offline first to make sure its not a cached copy or grabbing anything from ur db or so

2011-04-08T18:53:31  <amstan> ahmedhelal: it doesn't like your zip: need PK compat. v6.3 (can do v4.6)
2011-04-08T18:53:49  <ahmedhelal> urgh 1 sec
2011-04-08T18:54:34  <ahmedhelal> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15722463/visualized.zip
2011-04-08T18:50:51  <ahmedhelal> works ?
2011-04-08T18:50:59  <ahmedhelal> amstan: ^^
2011-04-08T18:51:53  <amstan> ahmedhelal: yes, problem is that you're downloading a css and a js file for each file
2011-04-08T18:51:58  <amstan> even though they're all the same
2011-04-08T18:52:52  <ahmedhelal> so its a storage problem now ? :)
2011-04-08T18:55:25  <amstan> well.. you don't want to waste space on such things

2011-04-08T18:58:09  <ahmedhelal> ill try to see if i can fix that, but if not i think this would be the best option so far, wasting few megabytes and saving alot of work and effort
2011-04-08T18:58:25  <amstan> it's a small thing, it could be potentially fixed
2011-04-08T18:58:33  <amstan> it's probably a setting of your downloader
2011-04-08T18:59:14  <ahmedhelal> yeah it might not be fixable though, due to the way that php page returns the data
2011-04-08T18:59:47  <amstan> the js file does not change, yet your script makes a new js file for every game
2011-04-08T19:00:10  <amstan> also.. what about the links from other places, do they get rewritten?
2011-04-08T19:00:24  <ahmedhelal> what links ?
2011-04-08T19:00:56  <amstan> from this page for example: http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=8565
2011-04-08T19:04:06  <ahmedhelal> will investigate the whole thing tonight
2011-04-08T19:05:35  <amstan> ahmedhelal: yes.. the server setup is public, see the topic

2011-04-08T19:48:57  <antimatroid> i don't think so, what do you want to be ready?

2011-04-08T19:49:16  <amstan> well.. we have to finalize the rules then
2011-04-08T19:49:22  <amstan> what's the hold on that, jeff?
2011-04-08T19:50:54  <antimatroid> i think we'd pretty much be right with a fighting rule
