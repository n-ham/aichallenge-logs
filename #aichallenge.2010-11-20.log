2010-11-20T00:01:05  <Zannick> janzert: really? i thought waterloo and the main server were in est
2010-11-20T00:01:26  <Zannick> i mean, they were edt at the start of the tournament, which would explain why it seems like cst now...
2010-11-20T00:02:13  <janzert> nope it did the switch at the daylight savings time like it should
2010-11-20T00:02:18  <Zannick> ah
2010-11-20T00:02:22  <Zannick> i dunno then
2010-11-20T00:02:22  <janzert> messed up the averages when it did :)
2010-11-20T00:02:39  <janzert> yeah, I don't know where it's actually located but I do know it has been CST all along
2010-11-20T00:03:09  <Zannick> you should see what happens with monitoring graphs when daylight savings occurs
2010-11-20T00:03:13  <Zannick> it's hilarious
2010-11-20T00:03:15  <janzert> hehe
2010-11-20T00:03:17  <janzert> yeah

2010-11-20T01:38:13  <antimatroid1> why would c++ cout characters for me as i like, but the moment i put them in an output file, they're completely messed up jumble?
2010-11-20T01:56:51  <bhasker> are you interleaving to the file
2010-11-20T01:57:02  <bhasker> as in are two processes writing tot he same file
2010-11-20T01:57:14  <antimatroid1> no, i have two different files
2010-11-20T01:57:23  <bhasker> if you could paste some code
2010-11-20T01:57:26  <antimatroid1> i've given up, i'll do that once ai is done
2010-11-20T01:57:27  <bhasker> i can help you
2010-11-20T01:57:31  <antimatroid1> k, hold up
2010-11-20T01:57:34  <bhasker> though if this is for logging
2010-11-20T01:57:54  <bhasker> i would just log everything to stdout
2010-11-20T01:57:59  <bhasker> sorry stderr
2010-11-20T01:58:04  <bhasker> and redirect to file
2010-11-20T01:58:08  <bhasker> to capture the logs:)

2010-11-20T01:58:35  <antimatroid1> that seems to almost do it, but it's still not working quite right :\
2010-11-20T01:58:58  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to strip uesless rows and columns from a file
2010-11-20T01:59:05  <antimatroid1> but that should just be respitting it out

2010-11-20T01:59:22  <bhasker> the code looks fine to me
2010-11-20T01:59:26  <bhasker> let me try and run it
2010-11-20T01:59:42  <smloh1> how is it messed up? no end-of-lines?
2010-11-20T02:00:42  <antimatroid1> hang on, i'm doing a paste of input and output now
2010-11-20T02:00:48  <antimatroid1> it's a fairly large maze
2010-11-20T02:00:49  <bhasker> that looks just fine
2010-11-20T02:00:52  <bhasker> i don't see any issues
2010-11-20T02:01:01  <bhasker> the file got recreated just fine
2010-11-20T02:02:10  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/e7oicJR6
2010-11-20T02:02:19  <antimatroid1> that's the first 6 lines of my input
2010-11-20T02:02:50  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/eWQRENdj
2010-11-20T02:03:06  <antimatroid1> that's the first 6 lines of my output, the mazee stuff is wrong and there is crap at the end of lines
2010-11-20T02:04:49  <bhasker> i think its newlines
2010-11-20T02:04:54  <bhasker> are you on windows?
2010-11-20T02:05:05  <antimatroid1> i am
2010-11-20T02:05:12  <antimatroid1> i'm using notepad++ though
2010-11-20T02:05:15  <antimatroid1> that usually does me well
2010-11-20T02:06:16  <bhasker> i have a feeling its reading beyond end of line
2010-11-20T02:06:33  <bhasker> rather writing
2010-11-20T02:06:41  <Zannick> what you code in won't save you from the horrors of \r\n
2010-11-20T02:07:12  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-20T02:07:26  <bhasker> though c++ on windows should deal with \r\n correctly
2010-11-20T02:07:35  <antimatroid1> bah, i'll worry about it in a weeks time
2010-11-20T02:07:37  <bhasker> the problem might be your input file is \n delimited
2010-11-20T02:07:49  <bhasker> so getline is reading more than it should
2010-11-20T02:07:51  <antimatroid1> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/MAZE.png
2010-11-20T02:08:01  <antimatroid1> i was going to try and get all paths through and and highlight the shortest
2010-11-20T02:08:02  <bhasker> and you are getting junk as a result
2010-11-20T02:08:03  <medrimonia> hi
2010-11-20T02:08:25  <bhasker> do the following
2010-11-20T02:08:31  <bhasker> do you have emacs installed?
2010-11-20T02:08:35  <antimatroid1> nope :P
2010-11-20T02:08:41  <bhasker> or does notepad++ have a mode to show end of lines
2010-11-20T02:08:55  <bhasker> if so then make sure every line is terminated by a \r\n
2010-11-20T02:09:04  <bhasker> which in ctrl chars should be like ^M^D
2010-11-20T02:09:08  <bhasker> if its just ^D
2010-11-20T02:09:16  <smloh1> could he just open it and save it again?
2010-11-20T02:09:19  <bhasker> then you need to replace all line terminators with a ^M^D
2010-11-20T02:09:23  <bhasker> might work
2010-11-20T02:09:38  <bhasker> sometimes editors try to retain files original terminators
2010-11-20T02:09:44  <smloh1> or maybe cut and paste it into notepad and save it
2010-11-20T02:09:57  <antimatroid1> already tried resaving
2010-11-20T02:10:00  <bhasker> try to tell the editor to save the file in DOS mode
2010-11-20T02:10:07  <bhasker> if it supports that
2010-11-20T02:10:24  <Mjothvitnir> view|show end of line
2010-11-20T02:10:30  <Zannick> no, if it read past the \n it would read the whole file, not random jun
2010-11-20T02:10:31  <Zannick> junk
2010-11-20T02:10:50  <Zannick> it's reading fine, it's writing wrong
2010-11-20T02:11:09  <bhasker> i don't see why it should be writing wrong though
2010-11-20T02:11:47  <bhasker> but zannick what you say is right
2010-11-20T02:11:54  <antimatroid1> when i tell it to show line ends i just get LF in a black box there
2010-11-20T02:11:55  <bhasker> it will just read the file into a single line
2010-11-20T02:12:43  <bhasker> that is not right i think, on windows it should be a LF followed by a NL
2010-11-20T02:12:46  <amstan> antimatroid1: that's easy..
2010-11-20T02:12:49  <amstan> antimatroid1: flood fill
2010-11-20T02:12:54  <Zannick> what if you output maze[i].c_str() instead of just maze[i]?
2010-11-20T02:13:09  <bhasker> Zannick that should not be required though with a c++ string
2010-11-20T02:13:10  <bhasker> and cout
2010-11-20T02:13:13  <Zannick> i know
2010-11-20T02:13:16  <amstan> antimatroid1: implement a tron bot using flood fill, that should give you shortest
2010-11-20T02:13:38  <Zannick> i'm guessing it's outputting part of the vector container rather than just the string
2010-11-20T02:13:41  <antimatroid1> amstan: i was going to just turn it into a graph
2010-11-20T02:13:44  <amstan> wait..
2010-11-20T02:13:46  <amstan> nvm
2010-11-20T02:13:49  <amstan> will it? hmm
2010-11-20T02:14:03  <bhasker> that would be a bug in the string output code , what compiler are you using antimatroid?
2010-11-20T02:14:43  <antimatroid1> migi32 i think
2010-11-20T02:14:58  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure i would have been lazy and just got it with codeblocks
2010-11-20T02:15:54  <antimatroid1> amstan: it would be interesting to see two tron bots play in a connected maze
2010-11-20T02:16:06  <amstan> antimatroid1: did that, wasn't that fun
2010-11-20T02:16:17  <antimatroid1> bots were too stupid?

2010-11-20T04:20:02  <antimatroid1> the errors were from it not liking my old bot being spread over multiple folders, then i haven't got the rewrite to state to upload :P
2010-11-20T04:20:09  <antimatroid1> in fact there's stil a lot of work to do :\
2010-11-20T04:20:26  <Mistmanov> Error323: shall we reupload our old bots and pretend nothing has happened -_-
2010-11-20T04:20:46  <Error323> Mistmanov: :/
2010-11-20T04:20:57  <Mistmanov> me at 40 and you at 80 was better than me at 158 and you at 8 :p
2010-11-20T04:21:16  <Error323> well... no :P
2010-11-20T04:21:28  <Mistmanov> :(
2010-11-20T04:21:36  <Error323> but the fact that ur dropped that hard is quite harsh
2010-11-20T04:21:40  <Error323> how did that happen?
2010-11-20T04:21:58  <Mistmanov> I seriously just lost from #800...
2010-11-20T04:22:16  <Mistmanov> I think I made some calculation errors in me expansion calculator
2010-11-20T04:22:26  <Mistmanov> that made it way to conservative
2010-11-20T04:22:29  <Mjothvitnir> contestbot @rainbow 158!! who do I kill to get that ranking?
2010-11-20T04:22:30  <contestbot> Mjothvitnir: Run as fast as you can and don't look back.
2010-11-20T04:22:34  <Error323> janzert, amstan I'm wondering how important it is to win the first 3 games instead of losing the first 3. Will you always climb back up or can you be trapped in local minima/maxima
2010-11-20T04:22:38  <Mjothvitnir> oops
2010-11-20T04:22:43  <Mjothvitnir> @rainbow 158!! who do I kill to get that ranking?
2010-11-20T04:22:43  <contestbot> Mjothvitnir: !! who do I kill to get that ranking?
2010-11-20T04:22:49  <antimatroid1> mistmanov: why is there mixtmaov, mistmanov2 and mistmanovx users for you? :P
2010-11-20T04:23:05  <Mistmanov> mixtmaov? shouldn't be me :p
2010-11-20T04:23:12  <antimatroid1> oh, yeah :P
2010-11-20T04:23:16  <antimatroid1> just went into them
2010-11-20T04:23:37  <janzert> Error323: Say on resubmit you win 3 lose 3 then win the rest or lose 3 then win all the rest
2010-11-20T04:23:52  <janzert> Error323: in the limit you should end up in the same place
2010-11-20T04:24:02  <Mistmanov> ah, and mistmanov2 was something about entering a non-existing email adress -_-
2010-11-20T04:24:18  <Error323> well in theory janzert yes... but I wonder what happens in practice :/
2010-11-20T04:24:30  <Error323> I wonder what would happen to Mistmanov if he won the first 3
2010-11-20T04:24:30  <Mistmanov> (got a whole bunch of different aliases coupled to different domains for my university email... something I pick a combination that doesn't exist)
2010-11-20T04:25:10  <antimatroid1> it changes who you play against if you lose early yeah
2010-11-20T04:25:19  <janzert> I'd say his recent loss to the 812 rank was much more important than the first loss to th 92 rank
2010-11-20T04:25:31  <janzert> well not just say, I'm quite sure
2010-11-20T04:26:05  <Mistmanov> if you lose against a 800, you don't desrve a spot in the top 100 I think =)
2010-11-20T04:26:27  <Error323> well
2010-11-20T04:26:32  <Error323> it happens
2010-11-20T04:26:34  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-20T04:26:40  <janzert> give me a bit and I can give you what his ranking would be without either of those games
2010-11-20T04:26:59  <Mistmanov> although you're right that my bot performs better against better opponents
2010-11-20T04:27:10  <Mistmanov> it doesn't handle players who expand recklessly very well
2010-11-20T04:27:25  <Mistmanov> (at least, on the tcp server it didn't get utterly destroyed..)
2010-11-20T04:27:38  <Error323> janzert: well my point is the probability of him facing an 800 player when winning first 3 would have been reduced drastically
2010-11-20T04:27:44  <Error323> but yeah 800 is pretty low...
2010-11-20T04:28:06  <Error323> Mistmanov: tcp server requires atleast 10 hours of play or so
2010-11-20T04:28:13  <Error323> you can't say a lot after 2 hours
2010-11-20T04:28:16  <Error323> its too random
2010-11-20T04:29:16  <Mistmanov> yeah but still, I sometimes win from you on the TCP for example
2010-11-20T04:29:20  <janzert> but he hasn't beat a player ranked higher than 134 and lost to 4 of them
2010-11-20T04:29:38  <Mistmanov> losing against 800 and winning against 6 :P it still dependso n the map ofcourse
2010-11-20T04:29:46  <Error323> but he does win of me (don't know with what ratio though)
2010-11-20T04:30:25  <Error323> well its just something to be scared about :P
2010-11-20T04:30:26  * lavalamp_ <--- place 150 on main, yay
2010-11-20T04:30:48  <janzert> Error323: yeah, and I don't think he should likely be below 800 rank either
2010-11-20T04:30:49  <Mistmanov> ah it doesn't really matter. the winner of the contest shouldn't lose because his enemy is not good enough -_-
2010-11-20T04:31:13  <antimatroid1> people in the top 100 will still be playing lower ranked bots yeah?
2010-11-20T04:31:20  <janzert> yes
2010-11-20T04:31:40  <Mjothvitnir> it is pretty funny that the "top bots" would be so fragile that they can't handle an opponent that doesn't make "the best move"
2010-11-20T04:31:45  <Error323> janzert: if I keep hoovering in the top 20 and after lets say 300 games I meet an opponent from rank 800 that beats me, i would barely drop at all
2010-11-20T04:31:57  <janzert> right
2010-11-20T04:32:12  <antimatroid1> Error323: bocsimacko lost to someone in the 600s the other day and stayed in first
2010-11-20T04:32:15  <janzert> but you'll have faced many opponents near that rank in that time
2010-11-20T04:32:27  <Error323> janzert: that's true
2010-11-20T04:33:00  <antimatroid1> my worry is with playing better bots once you win the first few games and then having to play less games against bad bots than an equally good bot that lost some of its first games
2010-11-20T04:33:12  <Error323> i'm also losing quite a few matches against lavalamp for instant lol
2010-11-20T04:33:26  <Mistmanov> oh the shame ;)
2010-11-20T04:33:36  <medrimonia> Error323: Hmmm it's good to waking up and see that I've taken my revenge
2010-11-20T04:33:48  <Error323> medrimonia: I hate you =)
2010-11-20T04:34:01  <antimatroid1> but i don't really care, that's just something i don't see as not being independent of order in which one wins
2010-11-20T04:34:08  <Error323> seriously your bot beats mine nearly everytime X_X
2010-11-20T04:34:11  <medrimonia> I've lost against #111 and I'm still in top 10^^
2010-11-20T04:34:23  <Error323> ... :P
2010-11-20T04:34:33  <Error323> viv la france et hollandia :P
2010-11-20T04:34:36  <medrimonia> I'm snipping you !!!!!
2010-11-20T04:34:50  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-20T04:34:58  <Error323> quite often indeed.
2010-11-20T04:35:03  <Error323> i should fix that :P
2010-11-20T04:35:13  <medrimonia> The funnier is that two of the five first in france at least are not really french
2010-11-20T04:35:47  <Mjothvitnir> elo code and opponent picker don't play well together :)
2010-11-20T04:35:55  <medrimonia> I just put french because I'm studying in France
2010-11-20T04:36:01  <Error323> raschi has a strategy where he just reuploads until he wins the first 4 games lol
2010-11-20T04:36:10  <Error323> but it seems to work to some extend ...
2010-11-20T04:36:39  * janzert thinks he should force resubmits to pair from the middle of rankings again so people can see that they climb back up :P
2010-11-20T04:37:02  <Mistmanov> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8048495 yay, my "bail out" code is working (see turn 152.. made me keep the planet in the bottom left corner for an extra turn)
2010-11-20T04:37:47  <Error323> haha
2010-11-20T04:37:52  <Mistmanov> (spectacular feature, I know ;))
2010-11-20T04:37:55  <medrimonia> The funnier is that Iwasn't expecting my bot to be ranked even in the top 20
2010-11-20T04:38:06  <Error323> yea same here
2010-11-20T04:38:15  <Error323> cuz i had quite some alcohol yesterday
2010-11-20T04:38:23  <medrimonia> And sometimes it's the opposite^^
2010-11-20T04:38:30  <Error323> but the marges are really small in the top 100
2010-11-20T04:38:38  <Error323> except for one dude ofc -_-
2010-11-20T04:39:02  <medrimonia> I'm thinking "oh that's good, I've made an huge improve" and I'm losing ranking^^
2010-11-20T04:39:39  * lavalamp_ grins about Error323's games with me
2010-11-20T04:39:47  <medrimonia> hmmm my new bot on tcp seems to be better than the official one =P
2010-11-20T04:39:58  <Error323> medrimonia: indeed
2010-11-20T04:40:33  <lavalamp_> this game is pretty exciting: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1103394
2010-11-20T04:40:35  <Error323> but the userspace is really small
2010-11-20T04:40:53  <Error323> lavalamp_: nice work
2010-11-20T04:41:04  <lavalamp_> yeah I'm pretty happy
2010-11-20T04:41:13  <Error323> good victory
2010-11-20T04:41:13  <lavalamp_> I'm terribly inconsistent though
2010-11-20T04:41:27  <Error323> well apparently... so am i ^_^
2010-11-20T04:41:40  <lavalamp_> george obviously has the rule that it's ok if he loses a planet for a turn
2010-11-20T04:41:46  <Error323> oh just won against smloh1 :
2010-11-20T04:43:34  <Error323> but ye medrimonia your sniping is quite annoying
2010-11-20T04:43:44  <lavalamp_> I have a sniping problem
2010-11-20T04:43:46  <lavalamp_> :(
2010-11-20T04:44:00  <medrimonia> hahaha It's because you're not conservative enough
2010-11-20T04:44:08  <lavalamp_> I need to fix it, I get sniped in every game
2010-11-20T04:44:22  <medrimonia> I had the same problem has you before Error323
2010-11-20T04:44:25  <lavalamp_> I thought my defense code woud take care of it but no :(
2010-11-20T04:45:31  <Error323> medrimonia: I'll work it out just you wait :P
2010-11-20T04:45:50  <lavalamp_> my new defensive code is working so well otherwise :(
2010-11-20T04:46:15  <medrimonia> Error323: Now I've other issues, but... my main issue on tcp server is BAD CONNECTION!!!!!!
2010-11-20T04:46:42  <Error323> lavalamp_: make sure your defense code also defends neutrals that you attack along with the enemy
2010-11-20T04:46:48  *** tim_ <tim_!~tim@77-21-13-43-dynip.superkabel.de> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-20T04:47:20  <medrimonia> haha beat you on tcp Error323:
2010-11-20T04:47:28  * lavalamp_ *checks*
2010-11-20T04:47:39  <Error323> medrimonia: ur beating me a lot on tcp
2010-11-20T04:47:49  <Error323> more than i beat you it seems >_<
2010-11-20T04:48:01  <Error323> however
2010-11-20T04:48:07  <medrimonia> Yes, I've changed some thing to expand more
2010-11-20T04:48:15  <Error323> its also about being effective against others :P
2010-11-20T04:48:20  <lavalamp_> yeah it definitely already is
2010-11-20T04:48:34  <medrimonia> I won 5 games against dmj in a stroke^^
2010-11-20T04:48:50  <Error323> yeah I saw that
2010-11-20T04:49:02  <lavalamp_> it's possible that my eval function thinks the position is so good it doesn't matter if I get sniped
2010-11-20T04:49:13  <Error323> chances of that happening are really slim when ur less good, so gratz ur probably better :D
2010-11-20T04:49:50  <lavalamp_> dmj and bocsi I have never beaten yet I don't think
2010-11-20T04:49:51  <Error323> i think they are (1/2)^5 ?
2010-11-20T04:50:14  <medrimonia> Beat mega1 or die trying!
2010-11-20T04:50:18  <Error323> i did, also bocsi but its raaaaaaare
2010-11-20T04:50:52  <medrimonia> My new bot hasn't played really against him
2010-11-20T04:51:09  <medrimonia> But his 0.70 version is really good
2010-11-20T04:51:36  <Error323> You LOSE against medrimonia
2010-11-20T04:51:37  <medrimonia> a month ago, I was winning more against him than now I think
2010-11-20T04:51:45  <Error323> I love how that just screams in my face
2010-11-20T04:51:54  <janzert> I have an idea for an experiment to check first game effect, but I'm not sure I can actually carry it out. Basically start to ragebots in the contest and artificially give one a win and one a loss against the current ragebot. Then you can watch what happens
2010-11-20T04:52:17  <rabidus> who wants to sell me logitech g25/g27 racing wheel?
2010-11-20T04:52:45  <Error323> janzert: good idea, but i think you need a real bot with a clear non-transitive relation vs other bots
2010-11-20T04:52:58  <Error323> or well it might work with ragebot also... not sure
2010-11-20T04:53:25  <janzert> actually I think whatever I do you'll still have doubts ;)
2010-11-20T04:53:45  <Error323> lol nah its a good test imo
2010-11-20T04:53:48  <medrimonia> janzert: Will we be able to see the games we're playing after the 27th?
2010-11-20T04:53:55  <antimatroid1> i was going to say, i'd prefer it to be done with a higher ranked bot :P
2010-11-20T04:53:56  <janzert> I believe so yes
2010-11-20T04:54:12  <medrimonia> Cool
2010-11-20T04:54:15  <janzert> Jeff hasn't said anything about shutting it off and I did not mention it in the proposed checklist
2010-11-20T04:54:17  <lavalamp_> Error323: did you see this game? http://tcp.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=14717
2010-11-20T04:54:18  <Error323> indeed that is cool
2010-11-20T04:54:50  <medrimonia> I have the feeling that I'll be thinking "gosh I've made a very bad mistake and I can't correct it. Damn!"
2010-11-20T04:54:52  <Error323> lavalamp_: ouch
2010-11-20T04:55:02  <Error323> hahah
2010-11-20T04:55:09  <lavalamp_> I gues it counts growth on the last turn?
2010-11-20T04:55:27  <Error323> lavalamp_: no it counts ships
2010-11-20T04:55:27  <lavalamp_> it claims I won even though you have 4 more ships at the end
2010-11-20T04:55:37  <janzert> two things I don't have a higher ranked bot and whatever bot is used for the first game needs to not be resubmitted soon or the first game won't be counted in the rating calculation for either of the experiment bots anyway
2010-11-20T04:55:43  <lavalamp_> no I mean it adds on growth before comparing
2010-11-20T04:56:20  <Error323> mja dunno, but i'm quite sure its correct in the game itself
2010-11-20T04:56:26  <Mjothvitnir> state info is for start of turn, winner is end of turn
2010-11-20T04:56:30  <Error323> i'm very conservative with neutral capping
2010-11-20T04:56:39  <Error323> i only take them when losing or drawing
2010-11-20T04:56:46  <lavalamp_> ah yeah
2010-11-20T04:56:57  <lavalamp_> I was going to say your expansion is not rapid enough
2010-11-20T04:58:15  <Error323> myes well I haven't figured out a way to properly fix that
2010-11-20T04:58:31  <Error323> but i've got more important antisnipe issues in front of me
2010-11-20T04:58:39  <Error323> or above that even...
2010-11-20T04:58:40  <Error323> i need food

2010-11-20T06:49:07  <Migi32> hi everyone
2010-11-20T06:49:26  <Migi32> Error323, is that your minimax bot on the main server or still the heuristic bot?
2010-11-20T06:49:46  <Error323> Migi32: heuristics
2010-11-20T06:49:51  <Error323> i gave up on minimax
2010-11-20T06:50:01  <Error323> because of time mostly
2010-11-20T06:50:08  <Migi32> k. Doesn't give me good hopes as I'm working on mine now
2010-11-20T06:51:24  <Error323> action generation and eval function
2010-11-20T06:51:33  <Error323> are the huge issues

2010-11-20T06:51:41  <Error323> and of those, mostly eval function in my experience
2010-11-20T06:51:56  <Migi32> eval function is less important if you can search deeper
2010-11-20T06:52:13  <Migi32> and I think I've figured out a way to search really deep (like maybe 50 turns) that makes some simplified but not ridiculous assumptions
2010-11-20T06:53:30  <Migi32> like that it's always a bad move to take a planet if you could've taken it the turn before and did nothing

2010-11-20T06:54:47  <Error323> going 50 deep is impossible when probing all good actionsets

2010-11-20T06:55:20  <Error323> which means you'll base ur decisions on the assumption that the enemy can also only make those actions
2010-11-20T06:55:26  <Error323> which will fail :>
2010-11-20T06:55:45  <antimatroid1> Migi32: i'm giving minimax one last go
2010-11-20T06:55:47  <Migi32> yes. I know I won't win but it's my best shot :P
2010-11-20T06:55:55  <antimatroid1> but it's striggling to make much of a tree
2010-11-20T06:56:15  <lavalamp_> I  really hope I can get my move gen fast enough to add back in the minimax :/
2010-11-20T06:56:38  <antimatroid1> i'm lucky to get past layer 4 if i only consider like 4-5 moves per turn
2010-11-20T06:56:48  <antimatroid1> and some of the nodes wont have that many possible moves left
2010-11-20T06:57:00  <Migi32> also, 50 may have been exaggerated but if you look at the first turn the branching factor is really high but if you look at turns 1 to 5(ish) the branching factor is 0
2010-11-20T06:57:12  <Migi32> on most maps
2010-11-20T06:57:34  <antimatroid1> first turn isn't usually so bad
2010-11-20T06:57:34  <Error323> no its not
2010-11-20T06:57:41  <antimatroid1> as you don't have much to do when calculating future states
2010-11-20T06:57:58  <lavalamp_> mine bogs down when I own a lot of planets
2010-11-20T06:58:03  <antimatroid1> it's once all the planets are owned and fleets are flying everywhere that i have most issues
2010-11-20T06:58:18  <Error323> you get ships each timestep, which you can distribute any way you want
2010-11-20T06:58:29  <Migi32> Error323, yes I know, I'm not streaming planets to the frontline.
2010-11-20T06:58:42  <antimatroid1> i don't think my new bot is going to need it
2010-11-20T06:58:46  <antimatroid1> just redirection
2010-11-20T06:59:29  <Migi32> streaming ships*, not planets :P
2010-11-20T06:59:43  <antimatroid1> i always make that mistake, i didn't even read it as planets :P
2010-11-20T06:59:45  <Error323> now that would be awesome :P
2010-11-20T06:59:47  <Migi32> and I'm assuming the enemy won't stream ships to the frontline also, which is probably an even worse assumption
2010-11-20T07:00:27  <Error323> yeah assuming things like that is lethal
2010-11-20T07:00:41  <Error323> you need highly compound actions for evaluation
2010-11-20T07:01:03  <Migi32> (planet, turn) is quite compound :)
2010-11-20T07:01:17  <Migi32> oh well, we'll see how it goes. I don't have much time left to start something new now
2010-11-20T07:01:38  <Error323> no i mean an action being a set of orders
2010-11-20T07:01:47  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-11-20T07:02:00  <antimatroid1> a single action for me still has a single destination, then a vector of fleets
2010-11-20T07:02:24  <antimatroid1> and i make a single action per node child
2010-11-20T07:02:54  <lavalamp_> an action for me (that I feed to the minimax engine) is a sequence of moves for the next (max distance) turns
2010-11-20T07:03:32  <antimatroid1> but a single destination?
2010-11-20T07:03:36  <antimatroid1> my fleets can arrive whenever

2010-11-20T07:07:16  <Migi32> what's the big benefit of that?
2010-11-20T07:07:25  <Error323> but you lose global scope
2010-11-20T07:07:40  <Error323> i don't have time for those type of experiments :/
2010-11-20T07:07:50  <lavalamp_> global scope? what do you mean?
2010-11-20T07:08:07  <lavalamp_> Migi32: benefit is that all my moves should make a lot of sense already
2010-11-20T07:08:21  <lavalamp_> so engine is just choosing between good options
2010-11-20T07:08:21  <Error323> well iirc you only take nearby planets into account for your actions?
2010-11-20T07:08:28  <lavalamp_> me?
2010-11-20T07:08:30  <lavalamp_> no
2010-11-20T07:08:38  <Error323> oh than i misunderstood
2010-11-20T07:08:39  <Error323> srry
2010-11-20T07:08:44  <Migi32> lavalamp_, with that kind of moves, how are you going to implement an evaluation function?
2010-11-20T07:09:03  <lavalamp_> I have a search order in which disntance is a factor
2010-11-20T07:09:23  <lavalamp_> eval function looks at the state of the board after I apply both player's moves
2010-11-20T07:09:40  <lavalamp_> it's also used to rate the moves as I generate them
2010-11-20T07:09:58  <Migi32> ok. And then? Let it fight out for 200 turns and see who has more ships?
2010-11-20T07:11:40  <lavalamp_> no I just look at the board at that point and apply heuristics
2010-11-20T07:13:06  <lavalamp_> if it gets close enough to the end I just use final ship count
2010-11-20T07:15:56  <lavalamp_> yeah if I realllllly restrict my move gen I can still do depth 2
2010-11-20T07:16:15  <lavalamp_> but no point in that until my move gen stops getting sniped
2010-11-20T07:16:24  <Error323> i was able to do 3.5K branching factor with 2 ply
2010-11-20T07:16:40  <Error323> but only on my local machine :P

2010-11-20T09:03:38  <dmj111> morning :)
2010-11-20T09:04:09  <dmj111> bhasker: i haven't read all the logs... you figure out your peformance problems?
2010-11-20T09:04:13  <Error323> howdy
2010-11-20T09:04:19  <dmj111> hi Error323
2010-11-20T09:04:29  <dmj111> nice work lately!
2010-11-20T09:05:57  <bhasker> oh yea
2010-11-20T09:06:06  <bhasker> i replaced all object lookups with tuples
2010-11-20T09:06:15  <bhasker> much much faster
2010-11-20T09:06:21  <bhasker> takes <2ms to update state for all planets
2010-11-20T09:06:23  <Error323> hey dmj111 thanks :)
2010-11-20T09:06:43  <bhasker> e323 is that your heuristic bot
2010-11-20T09:06:46  <bhasker> or your minmax
2010-11-20T09:07:00  <bhasker> and dmj is your bot pure heuristic?
2010-11-20T09:07:18  <dmj111> bhasker:  I always default to tuples for less than 5 items, at least at the start.
2010-11-20T09:07:24  <Migi32> bhasker are you using the entire 1 second per turn?
2010-11-20T09:07:28  <bhasker> nope
2010-11-20T09:07:38  <bhasker> for heuristics i barely need any time
2010-11-20T09:07:39  <dmj111> bhasker: it is not longer pure heurisitic, but it isn't really minimax either.
2010-11-20T09:07:57  <dmj111> i use my heuristics, and a bunch of hacks to explore a game tree.
2010-11-20T09:08:01  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-20T09:08:31  <dmj111> so, i am limited to only seeing move that I think are good, even for the opponent, which isn't the best plan.
2010-11-20T09:08:34  <bhasker> i am still very confused on how to implement a game tree for something like this
2010-11-20T09:08:56  <dmj111> me too.
2010-11-20T09:08:58  <Error323> its not that difficult
2010-11-20T09:08:58  <bhasker> so lets say i can make 5 simultaneous moves
2010-11-20T09:09:06  <bhasker> do i explore each move independently
2010-11-20T09:09:13  <bhasker> or do the 5 together make one state?
2010-11-20T09:09:29  <Error323> into recursion: move a, move b, simulate, move a, move b, simulate
2010-11-20T09:09:44  <bhasker> but what about when i can do move a,b,c,d
2010-11-20T09:09:46  <bhasker> at the same time
2010-11-20T09:09:47  <Error323> out of recursion: remove move b, restore state
2010-11-20T09:10:08  <bhasker> its not like i am limited to one move,
2010-11-20T09:10:46  <antimatroid1> at each node i pick a bunch of moves, then each child adds one of them
2010-11-20T09:10:54  <antimatroid1> then i do the same for the other player, and keep repeating
2010-11-20T09:11:04  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@112.134.123.202> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2010-11-20T09:11:08  <bhasker> hmm not sure i understand
2010-11-20T09:11:21  <bhasker> so lets say at top of the tree you could attack upto 3 planets at the same time
2010-11-20T09:11:28  <antimatroid1> a move has a single destination but a whole bunch of fleets that have different sources and different arrival times
2010-11-20T09:11:28  <bhasker> how does the game tree build out
2010-11-20T09:11:43  <bhasker> k so lets assume you have enough ships to attack 3 at the same time
2010-11-20T09:11:52  <antimatroid1> each child would have me take just one of the planets, and i'd also add a child to "do nothing"
2010-11-20T09:11:52  <bhasker> how will you explore the game tree for something like that
2010-11-20T09:12:13  <antimatroid1> then i'd let them make a move for each child, then for each of those children, see what i'd want to do then
2010-11-20T09:12:56  <antimatroid1> i don't model the opponent expanding at all
2010-11-20T09:12:59  <dmj111> bhasker: I think I am thinking the same thing as you.  In that case, you have to check attacking none, (a), (b), (c), (a,b,) ..... (a,b,c)..,  So you have 8 states for just three planets.  And that is a simple case.
2010-11-20T09:13:09  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-20T09:13:13  <antimatroid1> which is bad, but its too hard to have them expand and me not try to attack what they haven't already tried to claim
2010-11-20T09:13:34  <antimatroid1> dmj111: i tried that at first, but that blows out very fast
2010-11-20T09:13:45  <bhasker> yea but if you don't do that
2010-11-20T09:13:50  <antimatroid1> and even picking a, b st a and b are valid together seems tricky to me
2010-11-20T09:13:52  <bhasker> won't your solution be always suboptimal
2010-11-20T09:14:09  <bhasker> like if you could really capture two at same time
2010-11-20T09:14:11  <dmj111> yep, that is the problem.
2010-11-20T09:14:14  <antimatroid1> no, cause the game tree will have (a, nothing, b)
2010-11-20T09:14:33  <bhasker> hmm but what if capturing a or b is good
2010-11-20T09:14:36  <bhasker> but the combination is not
2010-11-20T09:14:39  <bhasker> because you overextend
2010-11-20T09:14:51  <antimatroid1> (a, nothing, nothing), (b, nothing, nothing)
2010-11-20T09:15:01  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-20T09:15:16  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure minimax picks that up though properly now that i think about it
2010-11-20T09:15:31  <antimatroid1> but otherwise, how do you pick a,b s o that a and b are feasible together?
2010-11-20T09:15:53  <bhasker> so what i am doing for 1 ply max is basically looking at all available ships
2010-11-20T09:16:07  <bhasker> and i build out all combinations which can be executed simultaneously
2010-11-20T09:16:13  <bhasker> basically i build a list of all single planet orders
2010-11-20T09:16:17  <bhasker> and combine them recursively
2010-11-20T09:16:25  <bhasker> and now i have alist of combined orders
2010-11-20T09:16:27  <antimatroid1> one option is to pick say, starting at best planet 1, can i take it? if so add move, can i take 1 and 2? if so add move, move onto 2, can i take 2? etc.
2010-11-20T09:16:29  <bhasker> which i then score
2010-11-20T09:16:56  <dmj111> antimatroid1: that is basically what I did.
2010-11-20T09:17:02  <bhasker> so then i can get a score for, a,b,c, (a,b),(b,c) etc
2010-11-20T09:17:18  <bhasker> yup thats what i am going to do now
2010-11-20T09:17:24  *** Zoost <Zoost!lestat@ihq.in> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-20T09:17:37  <antimatroid1> yeah, i think i might do that now
2010-11-20T09:17:38  <dmj111> after considering each planet, if i can take it, I launch the ships, update my game state, and loop again, like it was the beginning of the turn.
2010-11-20T09:18:04  <dmj111> sorry, I break after attacking to update the state, and then start all over.
2010-11-20T09:18:07  <antimatroid1> dmj111: do you still have them attacking you with their ships each turn?
2010-11-20T09:18:07  <bhasker> dmj what i do is
2010-11-20T09:18:15  <antimatroid1> how do you do that and work out which neutrals can safely be taken
2010-11-20T09:18:15  <bhasker> lets say the move is
2010-11-20T09:18:22  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3382), Raschi(3273), _iouri_(3250), _Astek_(3196), bix0r4ever(3164), felixcoto(3139), wagstaff(3128), protocolocon(3088), medrimonia(3086), george(3064)
2010-11-20T09:18:30  <bhasker> launch from a at time t, b at t+2,c at t+3
2010-11-20T09:18:51  <bhasker> i just change it so that all of them launch at t and just resolve for end state
2010-11-20T09:18:52  <antimatroid1> i can't work out how to do both of those things together, without literally generating states, having them attack, making planets safe, removing their moves, generating states, then making my moves
2010-11-20T09:18:55  <antimatroid1> which is way too much
2010-11-20T09:19:04  <dmj111> antimatroid1: i just caculated how long it would take me to get the neutral, how long it would take them to take it away, and see if it is a net benefit.
2010-11-20T09:20:01  <bhasker> do you guys think that is a good idea to assume that all ships launched at t
2010-11-20T09:20:06  <bhasker> and resolve?
2010-11-20T09:20:14  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2010-11-20T09:20:22  <bhasker> so lets say the complete move was
2010-11-20T09:20:30  <antimatroid1> my fleets have tadded, tsent and tarrive :)
2010-11-20T09:20:35  <bhasker> launch from planet A at t, planet B at t+2 and planet C at t+3
2010-11-20T09:20:42  <bhasker> so that they all reach at the same time
2010-11-20T09:20:48  <bhasker> i change the order
2010-11-20T09:20:49  <antimatroid1> although, i normally just use the tsent for neutrals, i'll just defend/attack as soon as possible
2010-11-20T09:20:55  <bhasker> so that all launches go from a,b,c at time t
2010-11-20T09:21:06  <bhasker> since i don't take into account future ships
2010-11-20T09:21:17  <bhasker> usually for an order to be executed i do have ships to fill the order
2010-11-20T09:21:36  <bhasker> so i just artificially increase distance between B and the target to be t instead of t+2
2010-11-20T09:21:43  <bhasker> oops t-2
2010-11-20T09:21:54  <bhasker> and C to be t instead of t-3
2010-11-20T09:21:57  <dmj111> i have done that, but wonder if it is good or not.
2010-11-20T09:22:13  <bhasker> if you are not taking future ships into account
2010-11-20T09:22:17  <bhasker> i think its equivalent
2010-11-20T09:22:28  <dmj111>  If I have to launch fleets in the future, I actually put fleets with negative ships landing at the source planet at the launch turn, and ships landing at the dest at the right time.
2010-11-20T09:22:33  <bhasker> but if you are executing orders assuming you wil have some ships on a planet at time t +3
2010-11-20T09:22:35  <bhasker> then its hard
2010-11-20T09:22:48  <antimatroid1> oh, the other thing about doing the game tree my way, cause it doesn't really take into account "when" a move is made, it will also consider your ability to make a move based on your first move, if that makes sense at all
2010-11-20T09:22:59  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@112.134.127.246> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-20T09:23:04  <antimatroid1> so you might be able to pick b, then a with benefits from b, but not a and b to begin with
2010-11-20T09:23:05  <dmj111> ahh, and here is a neutral fail for me: Components.classes["@mozilla.org/login-manager;1"].getService(
2010-11-20T09:23:06  <dmj111>            Components.interfaces.nsILoginManager);
2010-11-20T09:23:09  <dmj111> oops.
2010-11-20T09:23:25  <dmj111> http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8078226
2010-11-20T09:23:32  <dmj111> turn 39
2010-11-20T09:24:08  <dmj111> maybe turn 27 too..
2010-11-20T09:24:24  <bhasker> that was an expensive neutral for the growth
2010-11-20T09:24:33  <antimatroid1> are you just removing infeasible outgoing fleets?
2010-11-20T09:25:02  <dmj111> i was losing a lot of games by not taking neutrals, so I took out the safeties.
2010-11-20T09:25:07  <antimatroid1> i considered trying to remove the entire sections of the tree that become invalidated, but then i figured it might actually then continue trying to make the moves to that planet, whilst cancelling the "bad" fleets already sent
2010-11-20T09:25:43  <dmj111> i am not thinking about infeasible fleets, I belive.
2010-11-20T09:25:46  <antimatroid1> although, now that i think about it, the way i get moves, i'm not removing the invalid fleets from there, hmmm
2010-11-20T09:26:20  <antimatroid1> djm111: when you model both players, it's possible that you decided to send x ships from a planet at time t, but they then sent a fleet giving that planet less than x ships at time t
2010-11-20T09:26:44  <antimatroid1> working out how to handle that has probably been my biggest issue
2010-11-20T09:27:11  <antimatroid1> right now i have queues for outgoing fleets, and i just delete all the outgoing fleets that become infeasible
2010-11-20T09:27:46  <dmj111> ahh, yes.  I don't worry about that, though I should.
2010-11-20T09:28:17  <antimatroid1> i'm beginning to wonder if it's more expensive to handle than it's worth
2010-11-20T09:28:21  <dmj111> In fact, I tried worrying about it, and had code in place to cover for it, but it just mucked everything up.
2010-11-20T09:28:39  <antimatroid1> it probably doesn't happen very often
2010-11-20T09:28:40  <dmj111> I _hope_ since I mostly attack stuff I can get to first, that it won't happen often.
2010-11-20T09:28:44  <bhasker> i really wonder what is mega1's secret sauce
2010-11-20T09:29:05  <antimatroid1> we'll find out in a bit over a week
2010-11-20T09:29:08  <dmj111> yes, it will be fun to learn what he is doing.
2010-11-20T09:29:29  <bhasker> i just hope its something really fancy and not like a "now why didn't i think about that"
2010-11-20T09:29:35  <bhasker> cause then i will feel really dumb
2010-11-20T09:30:12  <antimatroid1> i don't think it's got anything overly fancy from what he's said
2010-11-20T09:30:13  <dmj111> hmmm.  I hear ya.  But  if it is something easy, maybe I'll be able to use it later for something else ;)
2010-11-20T09:30:15  <antimatroid1> but it could be a cover
2010-11-20T09:30:40  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty keen to see his nash bot too
2010-11-20T09:30:57  <dmj111> time to debug some neutral code, I guess....
2010-11-20T09:31:06  <bhasker> have fun dmj
2010-11-20T09:31:21  <bhasker> i think that neutral was simply a bad idea, its cost to recover was almost 23 turns
2010-11-20T09:31:29  <bhasker> actually 30 including travel time
2010-11-20T09:32:02  <antimatroid1> i have reverted to finalgrowthme-finalgrowthtehm for evaluation
2010-11-20T09:32:03  <dmj111> yes.... i agree.  i had code to think like that before, but it never took anything, so I was always losing solitaire games.
2010-11-20T09:32:20  <antimatroid1> it seems to stupid moves when i estimate the final number of ships for each player
2010-11-20T09:32:22  <dmj111> i took it out, and it does better sometimes, but this was a obvious dumb move.
2010-11-20T09:32:24  <bhasker> antimatroid i use a combination of two things
2010-11-20T09:32:28  <bhasker> ship count at end
2010-11-20T09:32:39  <bhasker> and growth at end state
2010-11-20T09:32:47  <bhasker> and initially the scoring will weight growth more
2010-11-20T09:32:55  <bhasker> as time goes by it will start weighting having ships more
2010-11-20T09:33:02  <dmj111> clever.
2010-11-20T09:33:09  <antimatroid1> that's probably a pretty good idea
2010-11-20T09:33:09  <bhasker> so towards then end my eval becomes a pure ship count
2010-11-20T09:33:10  <dmj111> mine is unaware of the turn still.
2010-11-20T09:33:31  <bhasker> so as game progresses it will favour states which give me higher ship counts
2010-11-20T09:33:35  <bhasker> than new growth
2010-11-20T09:33:43  <dmj111> that is the most useful idea I have stolen from here for a while :)
2010-11-20T09:33:50  <antimatroid1> i wont expand if my final growth is more than double theirs
2010-11-20T09:34:07  <antimatroid1> otherwise i just take forever to take people out
2010-11-20T09:34:13  <bhasker> though i realized i am evaluating beyond 200 turns
2010-11-20T09:34:21  <bhasker> since i was just checking the last state for each planet
2010-11-20T09:34:23  <bhasker> i need to fix that
2010-11-20T09:34:37  <antimatroid1> yeah, that's not hard to fix though
2010-11-20T09:34:39  <bhasker> though my bot that scores orders does worse overall
2010-11-20T09:34:44  <antimatroid1> i used to have that, don't at the moment but plan to re add it
2010-11-20T09:35:11  <bhasker> i am just coding in my order Combining logic
2010-11-20T09:35:15  <bhasker> to score combined orders
2010-11-20T09:35:22  <bhasker> lets see how it does after that
2010-11-20T09:35:31  <bhasker> right now its pretty dumb
2010-11-20T09:35:37  <bhasker> execute order with highest score
2010-11-20T09:35:49  <bhasker> then keep executing lower scored orders if i have neough ships
2010-11-20T09:35:55  <bhasker> so its a suboptimal solution
2010-11-20T09:36:54  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i'm going to try stripping out some of the not overly importnat computationally expensive stuff and see if it still does about the same
2010-11-20T09:37:56  <antimatroid1> i changed to just having states maxdist+1 for each planet and only making moves up to maxdist
2010-11-20T09:38:11  <antimatroid1> i figure the games often changes too much for those old moves to still be valid anyway
2010-11-20T09:38:18  <antimatroid1> and it halved the number of states almost
2010-11-20T09:38:49  <antimatroid1> bhasker: you're using 2*maxD + 1 yeah?
2010-11-20T09:38:57  <bhasker> yes
2010-11-20T09:39:43  <bhasker> the only reason i was doing till maxD+1
2010-11-20T09:39:47  <bhasker> oops 2*maxD+1
2010-11-20T09:39:53  <bhasker> was to account for ships in flight
2010-11-20T09:39:55  <bhasker> between planets
2010-11-20T09:40:01  <antimatroid1> yeah, i did that
2010-11-20T09:40:05  <bhasker> when i was looking far into the future
2010-11-20T09:40:10  <bhasker> i actually don't do that anymore
2010-11-20T09:40:13  <antimatroid1> but i cap finishing times for new fleets at maxD now
2010-11-20T09:40:15  <bhasker> i have an exponential drop off
2010-11-20T09:40:20  <bhasker> i don't even do that
2010-11-20T09:40:26  <bhasker> i stop at like 5 turns or something
2010-11-20T09:40:40  <bhasker> i weight the fleets at next 3-4 turns at full value
2010-11-20T09:40:41  <antimatroid1> is that for adding fleets or them finishing?
2010-11-20T09:40:44  <bhasker> adding
2010-11-20T09:40:58  <bhasker> and then i just exponentially drop off the new fleets
2010-11-20T09:41:02  <bhasker> from growth etc
2010-11-20T09:41:11  <antimatroid1> yeah, i use a prioirity queue and pick the ones that were added soonest, but keep using any fleets at any time
2010-11-20T09:41:27  <bhasker> taking too much of future into account just stalls my bot completely
2010-11-20T09:41:55  <bhasker> in fact now i am going with a zero defense code except when its under attack and when its in the initial stages of growth
2010-11-20T09:42:14  <bhasker> so it will launch ships even if it loses the planet it launched from due to a counter attack
2010-11-20T09:42:42  <bhasker> though with a 1 ply scoring its not optimal
2010-11-20T09:43:00  <bhasker> basically my available ships calculation is something like
2010-11-20T09:43:17  <bhasker> if planetUnderAttack: calculate Available ships else: availableShips = p.NumShips
2010-11-20T09:43:41  <bhasker> though it doesn't work out very well in all circumstances
2010-11-20T09:43:53  <bhasker> i have also been thinking of having multiple availability lists
2010-11-20T09:44:03  <bhasker> one for having ships that are free to attack neutrals
2010-11-20T09:44:20  <bhasker> and one for ships that are free to defend/attack mine/enemy plantes
2010-11-20T09:44:30  <bhasker> the first one will be calculated more strictly than the other
2010-11-20T09:44:41  <bhasker> but not sure how to do it
2010-11-20T09:47:23  <antimatroid1> hmm, i think i should be able to make it way more efficient than it is now without actually losing much information, bah, back in a few hours :)
2010-11-20T09:59:09  <dmj111> antimatroid1: funny enough... _one_ of my current problems is that I ignore that the enemy can stop my plans....

2010-11-20T10:19:01  <Error323> Mistmanov: ur comming back :D
2010-11-20T10:19:06  <Error323> #66 now
2010-11-20T10:19:10  <Error323> nice
2010-11-20T10:19:37  <antimatroid1> dmj111: I'm not sure what I'm doing does an amazing job at that
2010-11-20T10:22:02  <antimatroid1> i'd be keen for another contest almost straight away
2010-11-20T10:22:12  <antimatroid1> but i'm on holidays, i assume that'd almost kill some people?
2010-11-20T10:23:08  <dmj111> i am looking forward to the end of this.  my other hobbies have suffered.
2010-11-20T10:23:39  <dmj111> but it has been fun
2010-11-20T10:23:42  <dmj111> and, I wish it ended when I was doing better ;-)
2010-11-20T10:23:58  <dmj111> but learning how bocsimacko's bot works will be interesting.
2010-11-20T10:24:19  <antimatroid1> i haven't had any other hobbies while this is on aha
2010-11-20T10:26:38  <medrimonia> Gosh I'm starting a loosing streak!

2010-11-20T10:28:48  <medrimonia> Error323: You resubmit?
2010-11-20T10:28:52  <dmj111> medrimonia, bhasker : have you guys used pdb very much?  I should have used it sooner, but have been depending on logging instead.  pdb _is_ pretty nice.
2010-11-20T10:29:03  <bhasker> hmm not using pdb
2010-11-20T10:29:05  <dmj111> (not to leave out any other python users here)
2010-11-20T10:29:06  <Error323> medrimonia: yeah... but two lossess >_<
2010-11-20T10:29:11  <Error323> though its doing much better on tcp
2010-11-20T10:29:21  <Error323> so i figured it'll do better there heh
2010-11-20T10:29:22  <bhasker> i just rely on extensive logging right now
2010-11-20T10:29:32  <dmj111> that is what I was doing too.
2010-11-20T10:29:44  <dmj111> i had a frustrating bug that logging just wasn't handling.
2010-11-20T10:29:55  <bhasker> hmm i haven't run into something like that yet
2010-11-20T10:30:01  <bhasker> since my bot is pretty simple
2010-11-20T10:30:07  <bhasker> i am not doing minmax etc
2010-11-20T10:30:19  <bhasker> so its a pretty simple set of steps to identify issues
2010-11-20T10:30:31  <dmj111> yeah.  that is true... it was in the code where I was considering enemy responses, so I was losing track of who was doing what.
2010-11-20T10:30:51  <bhasker> though i might use it to track my stupid invalid orders code

2010-11-20T10:31:24  <dmj111> but in pdb, you have access to everything, and can dig through objects, call functions, etc.
2010-11-20T10:31:28  <bhasker> s/code/bug
2010-11-20T10:31:35  <bhasker> yea i have used it a little before
2010-11-20T10:31:57  <dmj111> I rarely do, so that is why I am a little spun up about it.  usually isn't necessary.
2010-11-20T10:34:08  <Error323> guys is the number of ships on a neutral ever smaller than its growthrate?
2010-11-20T10:35:22  <dmj111> it has happened.
2010-11-20T10:35:27  <dmj111> not sure about the new generator though.
2010-11-20T10:37:05  <medrimonia> dmj111: I don't even know what's pdb^^^
2010-11-20T10:37:19  <medrimonia> I'm still a rookie in programmation so...
2010-11-20T10:38:25  <dmj111> ahhh, I wouldn't have guessed.
2010-11-20T10:38:30  <dmj111> it is the python debugger.

2010-11-20T10:38:59  <dmj111> i tend to use logging instead most of the time, but sometimes it is useful to have access to stuff whie it is running.
2010-11-20T10:39:46  <antimatroid1> Error323: it can start like that
2010-11-20T10:39:55  <antimatroid1> and it can most certainly happen from someone attacking it

2010-11-20T10:42:23  <Error323> well it can make some things go faster

2010-11-20T10:42:30  <Error323> i sometimes use it

2010-11-20T10:43:07  <antimatroid1> ha yeah, so much information being used
2010-11-20T10:44:32  <medrimonia> Does someone knows a good tcp client on windows?
2010-11-20T10:44:46  <antimatroid1> what's wrong with jbotmanager?

2010-11-20T11:22:14  <Mjothvitnir> it should just be adding "python MyBot.py" in the bot tab
2010-11-20T11:22:24  <medrimonia> doesn't work =(
2010-11-20T11:22:28  <Error323> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1107134 omg the fail
2010-11-20T11:22:32  <Mjothvitnir> is python in your path?
2010-11-20T11:23:01  <Mjothvitnir> try "fulpath\python MyPot.py"
2010-11-20T11:23:01  <medrimonia> hum the MyBot is in my path
2010-11-20T11:23:32  <medrimonia> I'll try
2010-11-20T11:26:43  <antimatroid1> what do you guys do when you make moves and add them to your states? do you recalculate everything afterwards? or update the states you change, and if updating, what happens when a move has multiple fleets leaving the same source at the same or different times?
2010-11-20T11:27:24  <medrimonia> grrr hate windows....
2010-11-20T11:28:11  <Mjothvitnir> does the python starter_pack work out of the box?
2010-11-20T11:29:43  <Mjothvitnir> I guess I'm about to find out
2010-11-20T11:29:47  <Mistmanov> Error323: yay, the bailing out thing is again working as intended :p
2010-11-20T11:30:07  <Mistmanov> 2 days ago, my bot would've just sat still when it's being attacked..
2010-11-20T11:30:16  <Error323> yeah Mistmanov nice work
2010-11-20T11:30:23  <Error323> but i consider this a major flaw on my end
2010-11-20T11:30:29  <Mistmanov> ofcourse :p
2010-11-20T11:30:43  <Error323> capping neutrals in stupid places.

2010-11-20T11:35:45  <Mjothvitnir> I can start the python bot but it gives me an error "File"..." line X in main[;]   current_line = raw_input()    [;] EOFError: EOF when reading a line
2010-11-20T11:36:17  <Mjothvitnir> I would guess it is not happy about the LF/NL/CR thing
2010-11-20T11:37:16  <medrimonia> Hmmm still trying but...
2010-11-20T11:39:03  <Mjothvitnir> Did you fire up the jbotmanager from a dos box?
2010-11-20T11:39:08  <medrimonia> Hmmm maybe I'm in python 3.1.2 too
2010-11-20T11:39:09  <medrimonia> Yes
2010-11-20T11:39:34  <Mjothvitnir> does it give you an error when you try to use the python bot in the combat tab?
2010-11-20T11:41:17  <Mjothvitnir> looks like OpenOffice uses 2.6.1 (that is where I'm get python from) :)
2010-11-20T11:42:13  <medrimonia> no, it's not giving me anything in the dos box when I launch a combat
2010-11-20T11:42:46  <medrimonia> not even an error
2010-11-20T11:43:01  <Mjothvitnir> and nothing happens combatwise, weird
2010-11-20T11:43:32  <medrimonia> yes^^
2010-11-20T11:43:40  <lavalamp_> virtualbox
2010-11-20T11:43:51  <lavalamp_> it's how I get things done on windows
2010-11-20T11:44:21  <Mjothvitnir> when combat happens I get nothing until a winner is decided then in the window it tells me who won... wait what version of the manager?
2010-11-20T11:44:57  <medrimonia> I just downloaded it an hour ago
2010-11-20T11:45:21  <medrimonia> But I think I'll keep working with my linux computer
2010-11-20T11:45:35  <medrimonia> Even if it's not as effective

2010-11-20T12:20:30  <j3camero> Oh maybe not
2010-11-20T12:20:37  <j3camero> Sup amstan.
2010-11-20T12:20:42  <amstan> nm
2010-11-20T12:20:43  <amstan> wait..
2010-11-20T12:20:44  <j3camero> I wanna learn Django today.
2010-11-20T12:20:47  <amstan> when's launch day?
2010-11-20T12:20:53  <amstan> j3camero: oh ya, good choice
2010-11-20T12:20:58  <j3camero> Launch day for what?
2010-11-20T12:21:10  <amstan> j3camero: end* day
2010-11-20T12:21:15  <amstan> next week, good
2010-11-20T12:21:23  <j3camero> Yeah 7 days left I believe.
2010-11-20T12:21:34  <antimatroid1> yikes

2010-11-20T12:21:48  * antimatroid1 would be down for another contest almost immediately :P
2010-11-20T12:21:53  <antimatroid1> hint hint j3camero
2010-11-20T12:23:47  <j3camero> Yeah man so would I
2010-11-20T12:23:58  <j3camero> But it takes so much work to get one off the ground.
2010-11-20T12:24:11  <j3camero> I am hoping that the move to open source will reduce the time to market on the next one.

2010-11-20T12:28:30  <McLeopold> j3camero: I'd like to be a contributor to the framework
2010-11-20T12:28:53  <Gromgull> Hi all - am I right in assuming that for a java contribution all classes must be in the default package?
2010-11-20T12:28:54  <McLeopold> I'm willing to do anything that doesn't prevent me from competing. :)
2010-11-20T12:28:59  <Appleman1234> j3camero, haven't had the chance to participate as much as I would like, real life too much of a blocker
2010-11-20T12:29:20  <j3camero> I hear that.

2010-11-20T12:30:10  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'm happy to contribute, but i think i'd be more of a hindrance than help with the framework
2010-11-20T12:30:17  <Appleman1234> j3camero, I also found tron a more approachable task,but that is probably because when ever I see galaga I think of netrek

2010-11-20T12:30:29  <j3camero> McLeopold you can contribute as much code as you want. It won't stop you from competing. The only thing that stops you from competing is if you've got root on a contest server, or you're a forum admin (not mod) or have some other kind of priviledged access to the contest.
2010-11-20T12:30:40  <McLeopold> j3camero: Specifically, I'd like to focus on an open-source tcp server.
2010-11-20T12:31:09  <McLeopold> I'm envisioning something that can be setup as a server, like usual, or run as a peer-to-peer.
2010-11-20T12:31:09  <j3camero> McLeopold: I forget, are you the one running the "main" TCP server right now?
2010-11-20T12:31:18  <McLeopold> no, the secondary
2010-11-20T12:31:23  <j3camero> Ah okay.
2010-11-20T12:31:37  <antimatroid1> it's much nicer though
2010-11-20T12:31:45  <Appleman1234> also the stability issues regarding the game server (which are probably fixed now) were another factor
2010-11-20T12:31:47  <McLeopold> until you see the code...
2010-11-20T12:32:13  <j3camero> Yeah there has been an idea to set up an official TCP server next time, or at least have the code for one ready-to-go in the code repo. I think it's a good idea. If you want to become the owner of that initiative that would be great.
2010-11-20T12:32:27  <McLeopold> alright.
2010-11-20T12:33:01  <antimatroid1> official tcp would be ideal i think
2010-11-20T12:33:17  <j3camero> I think the move to github will make this process even easier. Somebody like McLeopold could run his own github repo and also send us push requests.
2010-11-20T12:33:20  <McLeopold> yea, something that anyone can download and get running right away
2010-11-20T12:33:33  <antimatroid1> it would probably be worth asking dhartmei if he wanted to help, although i have the feeling he might be lucky to have that lifted off his chest
2010-11-20T12:33:52  <antimatroid1> lucky == happy
2010-11-20T12:33:55  <McLeopold> I really should talk to him.  I'd hate to steal his thunder.
2010-11-20T12:33:57  <j3camero> My original aim was to make the whole contest software package like that. Anyone with an Ubuntu laptop should be able to build and launch a contest instance in minutes, in my opinion.
2010-11-20T12:34:06  <McLeopold> I'm just standing on his shoulders
2010-11-20T12:34:22  <McLeopold> j3camero: yes, I agree
2010-11-20T12:34:28  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure on your idea of anyone being able to put up a new contest
2010-11-20T12:34:43  <antimatroid1> you'd need LOTS of servers, and there's going to be so many contests people would be spread out everywhere
2010-11-20T12:34:49  <McLeopold> j3camero: if I do the tcp server right, 2 or more could get a tcp server going and connect them
2010-11-20T12:34:58  <McLeopold> distributed tcp
2010-11-20T12:34:59  <dmj111> and, probably, to easily put up a new game / engine.
2010-11-20T12:35:02  <j3camero> I tried this time around. It's way easier to set up a PW instance than it was to set up a Tron isntance, that's for sure. But it's not as easy as I would like.
2010-11-20T12:36:02  <Appleman1234> would be interesting to see if a general framework is developed
2010-11-20T12:36:18  <Appleman1234> for deploying judgement servers, testing servers, tcp servers etc
2010-11-20T12:36:28  <antimatroid1> j3camero: have you looked at anywhere for funding recently? i would expect the number of competitors to continue increasing, so the number of servers is going to have to increase
2010-11-20T12:36:33  <antimatroid1> and some prize money would be awesome
2010-11-20T12:36:59  <j3camero> antimatroid1: you make a good point, that we might fragment the community by accident. I was thinking it would make things easier for developers to test their changes, and create new game engines. Development would be a lot faster if it was easy to launch a new instance on a test server to see the changes live in action.
2010-11-20T12:37:09  <jmcarthur> omg i take back all my complaints about how old the ghc version we are using is. i just found out about somebody whose university uses ghc 5
2010-11-20T12:37:18  <jmcarthur> i'm so glad we aren't them

2010-11-20T12:38:06  <antimatroid1> j3camero: i like the idea of having old contest servers available, and possibly even multiple servers with different maps sets for each "kind of game"
2010-11-20T12:38:28  <antimatroid1> but the thought of anyone adding an extra contest seems like it'd just blow out of control till nobody knew what to "enter" anymore
2010-11-20T12:38:30  <j3camero> antimatroid1: Yes funding could be an issue. I am hoping that the Google people will be receptive to giving this thing serious funding. I would like to have, say, 10 servers and maybe $10,000 in prize money. That would be the ideal scenario.
2010-11-20T12:39:09  <antimatroid1> that would be awesome, $10k would be way over what I would have originally been thinking
2010-11-20T12:39:23  <jmcarthur> i don't want to have more than one contest active at any single time

2010-11-20T12:39:48  <jmcarthur> in fact, i kind of like that this isn't a year-round thing at all
2010-11-20T12:39:53  <j3camero> antimatroid1: if we let people submit new contests (say, by subclassing a Game class or something), then we would have to have a ranking of contests. You would not have to wade through 5000 shitty contests to find the good ones. They would be constantly ranked by participation.
2010-11-20T12:39:57  <jmcarthur> that there are gaps in between makes it more like an *event*
2010-11-20T12:40:19  <jmcarthur> events build hype. continuous contests build project euler

2010-11-20T12:40:56  <antimatroid1> 2 a year would be reasonable
2010-11-20T12:41:05  <antimatroid1> 3 months has been very grueling
2010-11-20T12:41:13  <jmcarthur> ranking by participation doesn't seem to solve the problem in my mind

2010-11-20T12:41:45  <boegel> for some reason, it seems to think I'm issueing invalid commands
2010-11-20T12:41:46  <antimatroid1> not at the moment sorry, i'm about to head to bed
2010-11-20T12:41:48  <jmcarthur> i'm of the opinion that the contests should be thought up and organized centrally, not introduced ad hoc
2010-11-20T12:41:49  <boegel> which I'm not...
2010-11-20T12:42:02  <j3camero> There's a middle ground I think. Even though the old contests would stay open, the most recently launched contest would be "the main one", and it would have a submission deadline and a final tournament and such. Those would only happen 2 to 4 times a year, with spaces between them.
2010-11-20T12:42:02  <McLeopold> Maybe some "off season" contests.  Like a re-run of the tron contest to see if people can do better.
2010-11-20T12:42:10  <jmcarthur> yes
2010-11-20T12:42:14  <jmcarthur> off season sounds good
2010-11-20T12:42:24  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'd be down for a tron re run
2010-11-20T12:42:26  <Appleman1234> jmcarthur, what about programming games as a platform ?
2010-11-20T12:42:32  <medrimonia> boegel: Have you verified that you don't send flights with 0 or negative ships?
2010-11-20T12:42:38  <boegel> medrimonia: I did
2010-11-20T12:42:45  <jmcarthur> Appleman1234: i don't understand the question
2010-11-20T12:42:51  <boegel> medrimonia: my debug log says this is my last order:
2010-11-20T12:43:00  <antimatroid1> j3camero: one thing that would be nice in the future is maximums on paramters to do with map sizes
2010-11-20T12:43:03  <Gromgull> In the FAQ it says you can read from files - but it does not look like they get packaged into the jar durin gcompile?
2010-11-20T12:43:07  <boegel> medrimonia: [Order {orderSource = 10, orderDestination = 9, orderShips = 3},Order {orderSource = 2, orderDestination = 9, orderShips = 5},Order {orderSource = 9, orderDestination = 9, orderShips = 5}]
2010-11-20T12:43:08  <antimatroid1> at the start of the contest
2010-11-20T12:43:14  <McLeopold> boegel: 11 active people
2010-11-20T12:43:18  <boegel> medrimonia: all planets have the required number of ships in the current state
2010-11-20T12:43:24  <antimatroid1> i do like the idea of waiting to see what types of maps will be most interesting before finalising anything there
2010-11-20T12:43:26  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1, j3camero: actually, what would be nice is a *complete* specification from the very beginning
2010-11-20T12:43:32  <McLeopold> boegel: and I'll be using it today
2010-11-20T12:43:34  <j3camero> Anybody interested in creating a browser-based IDE? That's all we need before the entire cotnest happens in the browser.
2010-11-20T12:43:42  <boegel> no-one has seen games being counted as invalid when it's really not on there?
2010-11-20T12:43:43  <jmcarthur> allowing variable parameters is fine though
2010-11-20T12:43:56  <boegel> I'm not even getting a "You LOSE" message in that case
2010-11-20T12:43:56  <jmcarthur> as long as the range is defined at the beginning
2010-11-20T12:44:05  <antimatroid1> yeah, general rules are good, but they need to be very clear, and stuck to the generality specified
2010-11-20T12:44:06  <medrimonia> boegel: hum strange, do you write something to stdout?
2010-11-20T12:44:12  <jmcarthur> and as long as there is a way for the bot to know them dynamically
2010-11-20T12:44:20  <boegel> medrimonia: ah, hmm... my debugging might be on
2010-11-20T12:44:23  <jmcarthur> that's actually the main thing, i think
2010-11-20T12:44:29  <jmcarthur> variable parameters should be communicated to the bots
2010-11-20T12:44:40  <medrimonia> boegel: maybe ctrl-c: When you stop the game like that it's percieved like an invalid orders
2010-11-20T12:44:42  * boegel tries without debugging
2010-11-20T12:44:57  <jmcarthur> a generic key-value mapping would be plenty flexible i think
2010-11-20T12:45:08  <Appleman1234> http://phonons.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/cells-a-massively-multi-agent-python-programming-game/ and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game/
2010-11-20T12:45:10  <antimatroid1> yeah, my life would have been a lot easier for this too if the map passed me a value at the start saying how many planets there are and the maximum distance of the map
2010-11-20T12:45:31  <jmcarthur> i'm thinking things like number of turns. things you can't compute from the map state alone
2010-11-20T12:46:02  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I think a general contest language could be defined for all types of contests.
2010-11-20T12:46:05  <antimatroid1> yeah, but even then, it's sort of annoying to have to process the whole state, then set some things up, rather than allocate memory right at the start then fill the information in
2010-11-20T12:46:11  <boegel> medrimonia: same issue if I disable my debugging output ;(
2010-11-20T12:46:12  <jmcarthur> j3camero: why a browser based IDE? i would never use it...
2010-11-20T12:46:27  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i'm afraid of going "the xml way"
2010-11-20T12:46:33  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-qdaihlfipjonxghk> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-20T12:46:35  <j3camero> Yes, clarity has been an issue with the Planet Wars contest. Part of the cause of that is that I did not think people would take the contest so seriously. I'm glad they have, don't get me wrong. I am still in the mode where the contest only had 2 dozen people all in the same room and we could change the rules with a quick vote and it was no big deal. It's an issue we need to fix before the next contest so people don't get so frustrated.
2010-11-20T12:46:35  <McLeopold> NO XML!
2010-11-20T12:46:59  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: well, that's what begins to happen when you try to make generic protocols
2010-11-20T12:47:04  <medrimonia> boegel: strange... I haven't any invalid order that was false...
2010-11-20T12:47:08  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: simple stuff, like A-Z is game specific, # is comment, ! is variable
2010-11-20T12:47:10  <antimatroid1> what do you mean by a contest language?
2010-11-20T12:47:17  <boegel> medrimonia: strange indeed
2010-11-20T12:47:24  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: markup/protocol stuff
2010-11-20T12:47:31  <jmcarthur> for game state, orders, etc.
2010-11-20T12:47:38  * boegel tries benzedrine
2010-11-20T12:47:49  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: or just use json
2010-11-20T12:47:56  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: yeah i was just typing that
2010-11-20T12:47:58  <antimatroid1> but it's often so different depending on the game?
2010-11-20T12:48:04  <McLeopold> or yaml
2010-11-20T12:48:04  * boegel tries benzedrine
2010-11-20T12:48:07  <jmcarthur> json would be fine
2010-11-20T12:48:13  <boegel> (woops)
2010-11-20T12:48:17  <jmcarthur> yaml is tougher to parse if you for some reason have to do it by hand
2010-11-20T12:48:39  <McLeopold> because indention matters?
2010-11-20T12:48:44  <jmcarthur> partly
2010-11-20T12:48:53  <jmcarthur> it also just have several specific syntax rules for various types of data
2010-11-20T12:48:56  <jmcarthur> *has
2010-11-20T12:49:01  <McLeopold> there are good libraries for both, but I think json is more popular right now
2010-11-20T12:49:18  <j3camero> It's hard to create a general contest language. It would inevitably want to turn into XML, haha. What about games with more than 2 players? Games with only one player? Games that happen in one big persistent world shared by all players? What about games where state is carried between games? We can't anticipate everythign we would ever want to do.
2010-11-20T12:49:28  <jmcarthur> i love reading yaml. i just don't think i would mandate it when we have no idea what languages will be used in future contests for the bots
2010-11-20T12:49:40  <jmcarthur> json would be great in general though
2010-11-20T12:49:44  <jmcarthur> extensible, simple
2010-11-20T12:49:55  <jmcarthur> s/extensible/flexible/
2010-11-20T12:50:07  <j3camero> json is also very trendy, hehe
2010-11-20T12:50:18  <Appleman1234> hmmm
2010-11-20T12:50:23  <jmcarthur> key-value stores are the best way to be able to change the protocol as the contest progresses if necessary, too
2010-11-20T12:50:36  <McLeopold> j3camero: i think practically, it would be simpler than we can imagine
2010-11-20T12:50:40  <jmcarthur> this is kind of bike shedding though
2010-11-20T12:50:50  <jmcarthur> i'm more concerned with the big picture right now
2010-11-20T12:50:51  <Migi32> didn't read everything you all said so far, but what is wrong with the way the contest works now? What would json add to that?
2010-11-20T12:51:13  <jmcarthur> i want to see this taken seriously
2010-11-20T12:51:21  <jmcarthur> Migi32: it was a tangent, really
2010-11-20T12:51:27  <Migi32> oh ok
2010-11-20T12:51:32  <jmcarthur> Migi32: the main topic is the future of these contests
2010-11-20T12:51:39  <McLeopold> Migi32: a way to parse the game state consistantly, allowing for additions without breaking older bots
2010-11-20T12:51:48  <antimatroid1> j3camero: one player "games" are more decisions problems than games
2010-11-20T12:51:52  *** amriedle <amriedle!~amriedle@CPE0013f7f2be12-CM0013f7f2be0e.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
2010-11-20T12:51:55  <Migi32> ah ok McLeopold that makes sense
2010-11-20T12:52:04  <antimatroid1> and n>2 players gets really messy when people start thinking about coalitions in the game
2010-11-20T12:52:17  <antimatroid1> i would be down for an n-player game though
2010-11-20T12:52:21  <jmcarthur> messy is not necessarily bad
2010-11-20T12:52:22  <antimatroid1> not so much a 1 player game
2010-11-20T12:52:30  <jmcarthur> it means there's room for more interesting ideas
2010-11-20T12:52:37  <McLeopold> n-player planet wars is going to happen...
2010-11-20T12:52:42  <burny> I think TEAM games(2vs2) would be interesting though
2010-11-20T12:52:45  <j3camero> If I might add, I believe the biggest issue with future contests is labor shortage. It always has been. I find that once a new contest is launched, it's easy to get people to help work on it. But up until that point, it's a very lonely task. I am hoping that there will be more help now that it's open-sourced.
2010-11-20T12:52:49  <burny> but.. that requires totally different AI
2010-11-20T12:53:05  <burny> not nearly AS different as the a FFA game would require though
2010-11-20T12:53:09  <jmcarthur> i'm curious what n vs. n team games might be like, especially if we were to leave any interplayer communication protocol left unspecified and teams were random
2010-11-20T12:53:10  <boegel> medrimonia: hmm, I'm now seeing it on benzendrine too
2010-11-20T12:53:18  <jmcarthur> would require some self-organization on part of the contestants
2010-11-20T12:53:18  <antimatroid1> i'm happy to work on anything that i can do anything helpful with
2010-11-20T12:53:28  <boegel> medrimonia: really strange, because I'm *not* seeing it on the official server
2010-11-20T12:53:29  <antimatroid1> i'd be happy to do say c++ start packages etc.
2010-11-20T12:53:31  <jmcarthur> as in a channel is provided with no protocol
2010-11-20T12:53:53  <antimatroid1> and map generators etc. although they may not be the prettiest things ever
2010-11-20T12:54:06  <j3camero> Teams would be so cool.
2010-11-20T12:54:07  <Migi32> another big cause of the "labor shortage" is according to me the fact that you can't both help and participate in the contest
2010-11-20T12:54:10  <medrimonia> boegel: The only thing that I know which is different between official server and tcp is the 0-flights...
2010-11-20T12:54:17  <jmcarthur> teams would require a new ranking algorithm
2010-11-20T12:54:29  <jmcarthur> *cough* trueskill *cough*
2010-11-20T12:54:37  <antimatroid1> i like the idea of people being able to join user made groups in the contests
2010-11-20T12:54:47  <j3camero> Migi32: you are right. The rules around that have been drastically relaxed. Now you can contribute code and all that and still win the contest.
2010-11-20T12:54:51  <antimatroid1> say up to like 5 groups per user
2010-11-20T12:54:59  <antimatroid1> and you can look at the leaderboards for your groups
2010-11-20T12:55:37  <j3camero> Self-created groups (and commenting on game replays, and friending, following, etc) would be a huge driver of interest, I am sure.
2010-11-20T12:57:00  <j3camero> There is no good library or tool for adding commenting to the site. We have to build it ourselves.
2010-11-20T12:57:15  <Migi32> maybe also another simple addition: a Java webchat client on the website, there's a bit of a split between people who use the forum and those who use IRC
2010-11-20T12:57:21  <jmcarthur> we *really* need to come up with a good sandbox and loosen the restrictions on what bots can do, e.g. logging
2010-11-20T12:57:53  <Migi32> logging (and being able to see your bot's logs afterwards) would be amazing
2010-11-20T12:58:18  <antimatroid1> j3camero: you aren't going to have any objections to the leaderboard being live this time?
2010-11-20T12:58:24  <jmcarthur> also, tarballs of various things
2010-11-20T12:58:39  <antimatroid1> i think most competitors are in favour of it being live
2010-11-20T12:59:01  <Gromgull> ANyone? The rules say "You may not write to files. You may however read from files within your     submission directory, which will be the current directory." but at least for a java bot this is impossible as any data files is not jarred up in the compile step?
2010-11-20T12:59:34  <antimatroid1> meh, i could read from files easily with c++
2010-11-20T12:59:40  <antimatroid1> streams <3
2010-11-20T12:59:43  <jmcarthur> it would be cool if contestants could keep little dev blogs or at least notes on their profile pages
2010-11-20T12:59:55  <antimatroid1> just allow people to alter about me
2010-11-20T13:00:10  <antimatroid1> or add a text box on strategy description
2010-11-20T13:00:39  <Migi32> jmcarthur, trying to centralise dev blogs would be a step too far, I think
2010-11-20T13:00:42  <Gromgull> antimatroid1: Really? So there is no jar step during compile?
2010-11-20T13:00:43  <jmcarthur> maybe the dev blogs could be kept private until after the contest is over
2010-11-20T13:00:54  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i don't think too far, but maybe low priority
2010-11-20T13:01:05  <antimatroid1> Gromgull: what do you mean?
2010-11-20T13:01:21  <jmcarthur> i do think it would be nice to be able to click on a bot and see a dev log right there
2010-11-20T13:01:21  * antimatroid1 can't stand java and doesn't know how it works
2010-11-20T13:01:38  <McLeopold> It could be an option.
2010-11-20T13:01:51  <antimatroid1> i like the idea of being able to download peoples code off their profile once the contest is finished (should the user have wanted to share)
2010-11-20T13:01:53  <McLeopold> You can toss a wiki in with Django, no problem
2010-11-20T13:01:58  <j3camero> Setting up dev blogs we could maybe do with relatively zero effort. I was toying with the idea of building the website on top of an exiting CMS like wordpress or somesuch.
2010-11-20T13:01:59  <antimatroid1> doing it in the forums is so messy
2010-11-20T13:02:14  <Gromgull> antimatroid1: for java everything was compiled, then only the binaries generated zipped up - it seems any other file was not there at runtime
2010-11-20T13:02:16  <Migi32> jmcarthur, if you could easily change your description on your profile, you could use that to link to your blog
2010-11-20T13:02:17  <Gromgull> I think
2010-11-20T13:02:20  <jmcarthur> IMO bots should be set up however you want and you should be expected to provide shell scripts for compilation and for running
2010-11-20T13:02:25  <Gromgull> since I cannot see the output it's hard to say :)
2010-11-20T13:02:26  <burny> so how exactly does 'google' fit into this?.. they just donating spare processing power?
2010-11-20T13:02:36  <jmcarthur> burny: name only right now :(
2010-11-20T13:02:40  <jmcarthur> it's silly
2010-11-20T13:02:45  <McLeopold> but it worked
2010-11-20T13:02:50  <Migi32> lol, true
2010-11-20T13:02:51  <antimatroid1> would binaries be doable in the future?
2010-11-20T13:02:58  <antimatroid1> that seemed like a good idea
2010-11-20T13:03:01  <Gromgull> there is a ticket for this - but I guess it wont be solved now
2010-11-20T13:03:10  <Gromgull> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=75
2010-11-20T13:03:13  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: they better be. we just need a better sandbox
2010-11-20T13:03:14  <burny> who is payng for the processing then?
2010-11-20T13:03:27  <j3camero> jmcarthur burny: they also give money.
2010-11-20T13:03:50  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: in combination with my shell scripts suggestion above we could accept pretty much anything, modulo support libraries and compilers for those who want to compile on the server and stuff
2010-11-20T13:04:06  <j3camero> burny: its a combination of Google, UWaterloo, and me.
2010-11-20T13:04:12  <jmcarthur> j3camero: oh? first i've heard of it
2010-11-20T13:05:08  <j3camero> Yup they pitched a nice wad of cash. They are very nice.
2010-11-20T13:05:26  <j3camero> But we've spent it all because of the need for more workhorse servers haha.
2010-11-20T13:06:02  <Migi32> binaries would be awesome. We could statically link libraries that wouldn't otherwise be available on the server.
2010-11-20T13:06:19  <j3camero> I agree. Binary submissions would be ballin.
2010-11-20T13:07:14  <Migi32> but keep the "no threads" rule. I don't know if that was for a technical reason or not but I like it :)
2010-11-20T13:07:25  <antimatroid1> how enforcable is that?
2010-11-20T13:07:36  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't even know how to use mutliple threads properly aha
2010-11-20T13:07:48  <j3camero> We had a really shady sandbox this time around. I am surprised that nobody has managed to crush the contest yet. When we have a better sandbox then binary submissions will be a 100% great idea.
2010-11-20T13:08:04  <j3camero> It's easy to enforce no threads.
2010-11-20T13:08:08  <j3camero> We do it now.
2010-11-20T13:08:23  <jmcarthur> if we use a sandbox that virtualizes a single core then that threading rule is irrelevant
2010-11-20T13:08:34  <j3camero> This is true.
2010-11-20T13:08:45  <j3camero> The ideal is to have a VM-based sandbox.
2010-11-20T13:09:07  <j3camero> If anybody here can solve that problem, that will be probably the single biggest contribution to the next contest. It's a really hard problem.
2010-11-20T13:09:14  <jmcarthur> even without a VM, the threading rule could be make irrelevant with control groups
2010-11-20T13:09:37  <jmcarthur> control groups allow you to impose resource constraints on a hierarchy
2010-11-20T13:09:37  * antimatroid1 doesn't have the first clue about that kind of stuff :)
2010-11-20T13:09:47  <jmcarthur> *process hierarchy
2010-11-20T13:10:28  <j3camero> I was working on a sandbox based on VMs (nick-named "sadbox"). It's kind of cool. You just run "./sadbox some_other_command" and it runs the command inside a fresh VM. Invincible security!
2010-11-20T13:10:49  <jmcarthur> j3camero: if we took in some more money (e.g. Google, donations, etc.) we could use slower sandboxes and just allow for more time per turn, making up for the slower execution speed with more servers
2010-11-20T13:11:02  <jmcarthur> the best sandboxes appear to be fairly slow, is my point
2010-11-20T13:11:35  <McLeopold> j3camero: If you allow binaries, then you need to make sure different binaries can compete.  A problem which a tcp server can solve.
2010-11-20T13:11:44  <antimatroid1> what the hell, now there's anothe rufes band person at like 32
2010-11-20T13:11:49  <antimatroid1> what the hell is rufes band/
2010-11-20T13:12:09  <McLeopold> j3camero: if every bot was wrapped to communicate via tcp to a contest server, you don't even need to run them on the same vm
2010-11-20T13:12:17  <j3camero> Yeah amstan what the fuck is Rufes band?
2010-11-20T13:12:27  <amstan> j3camero: no idea, lol
2010-11-20T13:12:39  <j3camero> You must have created the group?
2010-11-20T13:12:53  <j3camero> What did they say it was? A university?
2010-11-20T13:12:57  <antimatroid1> people just demand a name and he adds i suspect
2010-11-20T13:13:01  <j3camero> I should just fucking google it.
2010-11-20T13:13:05  <antimatroid1> already tried that
2010-11-20T13:13:27  <antimatroid1> i just think of date rape when i see rufes
2010-11-20T13:14:10  <j3camero> aha top result on google is their organization ranking page
2010-11-20T13:14:12  <mega1> rufus band exists
2010-11-20T13:15:06  <j3camero> They seem to be mostly from Spain.
2010-11-20T13:16:23  * janzert waves
2010-11-20T13:17:17  <j3camero> Hey janzert.
2010-11-20T13:17:22  <antimatroid1> BaronTrozo will be up into like second soon too :\
2010-11-20T13:17:33  <j3camero> People were just brainstorming all their ideas for improving the next contests.
2010-11-20T13:17:44  <janzert> great
2010-11-20T13:17:48  <antimatroid1> j3camero: a lot of that was regurgitated :)
2010-11-20T13:17:56  <j3camero> Yes definitely.
2010-11-20T13:18:07  <janzert> although I probably won't be able to contribute much until next fall again
2010-11-20T13:18:23  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3395), Raschi(3258), _Astek_(3210), bix0r4ever(3195), _iouri_(3179), BaronTrozo(3167), wagstaff(3148), felixcoto(3138), protocolocon(3075), george(3053)
2010-11-20T13:18:23  <j3camero> We should probably get a Wiki page going for all these ideas so we can order them and get people working on all them.
2010-11-20T13:18:52  <j3camero> Janzert are you busy with stuff for the next 8 months?
2010-11-20T13:18:56  <j3camero> In school, or working?
2010-11-20T13:19:17  <antimatroid1> pretty sure he's well past school
2010-11-20T13:19:35  <janzert> working on my Arimaa bot and working working after that
2010-11-20T13:19:42  <antimatroid1> i could be very wrong, i should stop answering other peoples questions aha
2010-11-20T13:19:55  <janzert> antimatroid1: you're correct though
2010-11-20T13:20:25  <j3camero> Nice.
2010-11-20T13:20:49  <antimatroid1> is arimaa that chess like game?
2010-11-20T13:20:58  <j3camero> I like this Arimaa sport. I should take a crack at it. I used to be huge into comp chess. My bot could beat GNU Chess :-D
2010-11-20T13:21:13  <antimatroid1> what kind of strategy do you use for picking your starting location?
2010-11-20T13:21:19  <janzert> yes, although about the only chess likeness of it is that you can use a chess board and pieces to play it ;)
2010-11-20T13:22:00  <janzert> antimatroid1: currently I think all bots just choose randomly from a few known good starting positions
2010-11-20T13:22:49  <j3camero> janzert: how are the best bots now? Are they even close to beating a human? How many weeks do I have to practice before I can beat the best bot?
2010-11-20T13:23:15  <burny> the best bots beat typical humas..
2010-11-20T13:23:18  <janzert> if you seriously study the game maybe around 2 months of work
2010-11-20T13:23:21  <antimatroid1> hmm, i may take a look at it after this ends
2010-11-20T13:23:29  <burny> and beat good humans in reaction time, but are only competitive in logic
2010-11-20T13:24:19  <j3camero> Is it something that would be any good as an AI contest? Or is it like chess where you have to do 5 solid days of work before you even have something that can play?
2010-11-20T13:24:26  <janzert> burny: what do you mean by typical humans? best bots are ranked around 2100 elo or so but I don't think it is that hard for a human to get there either
2010-11-20T13:25:01  <janzert> j3camero: yeah, I think the games are too cpu intensive and it takes too much work to get really competitive
2010-11-20T13:25:15  <antimatroid1> i like 2 player simtultaneous games for these
2010-11-20T13:25:16  <burny> janzart.. I mean that, a typical human would make mistakes
2010-11-20T13:25:26  <antimatroid1> and newish games like planet wars are awesome
2010-11-20T13:25:35  <antimatroid1> where it's a completely new problem for people to look at
2010-11-20T13:25:45  <antimatroid1> simultaneous*
2010-11-20T13:26:04  <janzert> burny: yes, but fortunately bots make more because they don't understand the strategic consequences :)
2010-11-20T13:26:52  <janzert> yeah for this contest we need something that can have reasonably quick games, have nice visuals, fairly simple to get started in, etc.
2010-11-20T13:26:58  <burny> I think that on average, the human programming a bot, would be about 200-500points above their bot
2010-11-20T13:27:27  <janzert> burny: nah, my bot is stronger than me
2010-11-20T13:27:41  <burny> ps: 'average'
2010-11-20T13:28:03  <janzert> maybe I don't really know
2010-11-20T13:28:25  <janzert> but yeah I'm probably the weakest player of all the programmers
2010-11-20T13:28:37  <janzert> I don't actually play hardly at all
2010-11-20T13:29:02  <antimatroid1> janzert: I take it you use minimax?
2010-11-20T13:29:07  <Migi32> well if the bot is a heuristic bot the maker will probably be better than their bot. But for minimax searches this is probably not so.
2010-11-20T13:29:10  <janzert> and I'm pretty sure with a couple weeks practice I could climb past it in strength
2010-11-20T13:29:20  <mega1> Error323: 7/1/92 and 5/1/94 for the "-test"
2010-11-20T13:29:29  <janzert> antimatroid1: yeah, all the best bots are alpha/beta of some sort
2010-11-20T13:29:41  <Error323> mega1: thanks!!!
2010-11-20T13:29:52  <Migi32> mega1, what are those numbers?
2010-11-20T13:29:53  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i'm going to give that a go i think
2010-11-20T13:29:53  <mega1> it's not what you expected
2010-11-20T13:30:12  <antimatroid1> Migi32: wins/draws/losses
2010-11-20T13:30:17  <Migi32> against?
2010-11-20T13:30:17  <j3camero> janzert: it's all about the negascout and MTD(f) :-)
2010-11-20T13:30:23  <mega1> Migi32: Error323's bots playing against bocsimacko-b0.70
2010-11-20T13:30:36  <Migi32> ok :)
2010-11-20T13:30:43  <Migi32> 7 wins, not bad :)
2010-11-20T13:30:58  <janzert> j3camero: I don't think MTD(f) is used at all, although I did test it
2010-11-20T13:31:08  <j3camero> How did it do?
2010-11-20T13:31:11  <janzert> lots of pruning going on of course
2010-11-20T13:31:20  <Migi32> MTD(f) is totally silly if you can only go 2 plies deep, I think
2010-11-20T13:31:26  <janzert> MTD(f) was quite a bit worse
2010-11-20T13:31:26  <j3camero> Oh yeah
2010-11-20T13:31:44  <j3camero> So you have to prune using some kind of heuristic?
2010-11-20T13:31:55  <j3camero> Rather than using strictly beta cutoffs?
2010-11-20T13:32:37  <janzert> Migi32: well remember all the searchers go step wise instead of turn wise as well so 2 ply is 8 steps and I generally reach 12 steps or 3 ply in most positions
2010-11-20T13:32:56  <janzert> well more on average I guess than most
2010-11-20T13:33:35  <Migi32> janzert, what's a step again?
2010-11-20T13:33:37  <janzert> j3camero: yeah, there are several pruning heuristics in place. A lot of the from the chess world
2010-11-20T13:33:59  <j3camero> I see I see
2010-11-20T13:34:02  <janzert> Migi32: moving 1 piece 1 square. you get 4 steps per turn
2010-11-20T13:34:13  <j3camero> Would you ever get a win from using something like the null move heuristic?
2010-11-20T13:34:21  <burny> how many people's bots aren't susceptible to being 'faked out'?
2010-11-20T13:34:30  <Migi32> janzert, are you talking about Arimaa all of a sudden?
2010-11-20T13:34:55  <janzert> j3camero: yes, although I don't specifically remember how much it helped it is in use
2010-11-20T13:35:05  <medrimonia> Actually, the best bot beats the best player
2010-11-20T13:35:06  <janzert> Migi32: well not all of a sudden :)
2010-11-20T13:35:09  <medrimonia> In chess
2010-11-20T13:35:10  *** Appleman1234 <Appleman1234!~Appleman1@CPE-60-226-176-19.qld.bigpond.net.au> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2010-11-20T13:35:10  <Migi32> oh, you are. I thought we were still talking about PlanetWars XD
2010-11-20T13:35:16  <janzert> hehe
2010-11-20T13:35:29  <medrimonia> But it's not really ai it's just brutal force
2010-11-20T13:35:33  <Migi32> I actually have a really good idea about how to make a bot for Arimaa
2010-11-20T13:35:39  <janzert> medrimonia: yeah, in chess the bots have well surpassed the humans
2010-11-20T13:35:52  <janzert> not in arimaa though
2010-11-20T13:36:08  <jmcarthur> i want to see an ai contest for game that involves shooting at each other, perhaps with a very large number of somewhat slow bullets so you can dodge them
2010-11-20T13:36:12  <burny> go is the game I'm most interested in, for writing AI
2010-11-20T13:36:15  <boegel> does anyone know which map this is, and where I can get it?
2010-11-20T13:36:16  <boegel> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1108405
2010-11-20T13:36:16  <medrimonia> I thought you were speaking about chess^^
2010-11-20T13:36:25  <janzert> Migi32: great come compete with us there after this is done :)
2010-11-20T13:36:32  <jmcarthur> it would have some things in common with tron in that you will want to trap your opponent without getting trapped
2010-11-20T13:36:34  <boegel> the server marks this as an invalid move on the first turn
2010-11-20T13:36:37  <Migi32> janzert, that's exactly what I was planning to do
2010-11-20T13:36:43  <boegel> and I have no idea why
2010-11-20T13:36:48  <Mistmanov> boegel: if you press "show game state" at the bottom of the screen, you get the mapfile
2010-11-20T13:36:54  <boegel> Mistmanov: ah, great, thx
2010-11-20T13:37:38  <burny> for a game like glacon.. I think the most interesting way to play, would be if you don't get to see exactly what the opponent does
2010-11-20T13:37:41  <jmcarthur> maybe with some sort of momentum so you can't just weave around the bullets so freely
2010-11-20T13:37:53  <boegel> Mistmanov: doesn't seem to work in this case, probably because there's no single turn being completed?
2010-11-20T13:38:01  <Mistmanov> it does for me?
2010-11-20T13:38:04  <jmcarthur> burny: yes! fog of war would be awesome :)
2010-11-20T13:38:05  <antimatroid1> "If a program wins the Arimaa challenge, it must be described in a paper submitted to the ICGA technical journal after winning the challenge in order to receive any prize." lame
2010-11-20T13:38:06  <boegel> hmm, weird
2010-11-20T13:38:10  <Mistmanov> I can see the list of planets
2010-11-20T13:38:18  <Error323> wut i'm owning on tcp
2010-11-20T13:38:18  <burny> eg. you can only see how many ships are on an enemy planet by owning a planet near it
2010-11-20T13:38:21  <jmcarthur> burny: things like that are what make me like poker IRL (not sure i want to do a poker bot though)
2010-11-20T13:38:26  <janzert> c# main file is MyBot.cs correct?
2010-11-20T13:38:37  <burny> and you don't get to see how many ships are attackign a planet(just know that SOMEthign is attacking)
2010-11-20T13:38:51  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: i want something like that too
2010-11-20T13:38:52  <Mistmanov> boegel: oh, it stopped working like right now
2010-11-20T13:38:56  <boegel> Mistmanov: :D
2010-11-20T13:39:01  <boegel> Mistmanov: wtf
2010-11-20T13:39:06  <Mistmanov> first time I looked at that map it worked, now it doesn't
2010-11-20T13:39:12  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: which thing? the shooter idea?
2010-11-20T13:39:27  <boegel> Mistmanov: maybe it can't be done by two people at the same time? :P
2010-11-20T13:39:33  <Mistmanov> could be =)

2010-11-20T13:40:01  <boegel> Zannick: ah, great, thx
2010-11-20T13:40:03  <antimatroid1> 3d would be awesome
2010-11-20T13:40:05  <janzert> antimatroid1: I'm not sure why that is still listed it hasn't been done for a few years
2010-11-20T13:40:07  <antimatroid1> but i'd settle for 2d
2010-11-20T13:40:08  <burny> excet, that you can't KNOW what the 'best' move it
2010-11-20T13:40:09  <burny> is
2010-11-20T13:40:24  <jmcarthur> 3d would be too hard to win unless there was like a maze to navigate as well... and then it gets hard to view
2010-11-20T13:40:32  <antimatroid1> janzert: what hasn't been done?
2010-11-20T13:40:35  <janzert> burny: hmm? arimaa?
2010-11-20T13:40:47  <janzert> antimatroid1: the ICGA journal article
2010-11-20T13:41:06  <janzert> although I think it would be great if it was started back up again
2010-11-20T13:41:08  <burny> no.. galcon
2010-11-20T13:41:16  <jmcarthur> a shooter with many players in a game would be even cooler
2010-11-20T13:41:21  <antimatroid1> people seem to spit out so many unecessary articles these days :|
2010-11-20T13:41:30  <jmcarthur> a FFA or something :)
2010-11-20T13:41:41  <burny> oh.. team based shooter could be neat actually
2010-11-20T13:42:00  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-11-20T13:42:08  <Error323> you know what's stupid
2010-11-20T13:42:08  <jmcarthur> harder to manage
2010-11-20T13:42:11  <jmcarthur> but cool
2010-11-20T13:42:18  <Error323> that ur rating drops when winning from low ranked people
2010-11-20T13:42:29  <antimatroid1> http://www.teagames.com/games/topdog/play.php
2010-11-20T13:42:39  <antimatroid1> that is a half decent 2d shooter game
2010-11-20T13:43:44  <jmcarthur> i was thinking more top-down style
2010-11-20T13:44:17  <janzert> I'd kind of like to see a game with partial information
2010-11-20T13:44:17  <jmcarthur> hmm...
2010-11-20T13:44:25  <jmcarthur> janzert: me too
2010-11-20T13:44:39  <jmcarthur> i'm half tempted to write up this idea i have in my head
2010-11-20T13:44:52  <jmcarthur> maybe with some diagrams to show things a little more clearly
2010-11-20T13:45:13  <burny> anim, as is, that game is way too trivial though
2010-11-20T13:46:28  <Migi32> how about stratego :P
2010-11-20T13:46:34  <Migi32> I really liked that game as a kdi
2010-11-20T13:46:36  <Migi32> kid*
2010-11-20T13:46:58  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-11-20T13:47:00  <Migi32> it's with impartial information yet not with too complex rules
2010-11-20T13:47:03  <jmcarthur> kind of simple though
2010-11-20T13:47:16  <jmcarthur> okay, i'm gonna write up some ideas...
2010-11-20T13:47:26  <janzert> Mistmanov: the accounts Mistmanov and Mistmanov2 are ones you lost the password for and are no long in use right?
2010-11-20T13:47:27  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2010-11-20T13:47:42  <antimatroid1> stratego? man, that's totally called guess who in australia
2010-11-20T13:47:47  <janzert> If that's the case I'm just going to disable the bot playing under Mistmanov
2010-11-20T13:47:57  <burny> guess who is a different game
2010-11-20T13:47:59  <Mistmanov> no problem
2010-11-20T13:48:01  <antimatroid1> jznaert: only 2
2010-11-20T13:48:13  <antimatroid1> oh wait, don't pay attention to me
2010-11-20T13:48:16  <antimatroid1> i thought you were talking to x
2010-11-20T13:48:24  <Migi32> jmcarthur, simple? I wouldn't be too sure. I thought planetwars was simple
2010-11-20T13:48:24  <antimatroid1> the two of you existing confuses the hell out of me
2010-11-20T13:49:12  <j3camero> Yeah we have to pick a game for the next contest.
2010-11-20T13:49:15  <j3camero> Hold em?
2010-11-20T13:49:18  <Migi32> it's as hard as the #1 bot makes it
2010-11-20T13:49:40  <jmcarthur> i'm just not a huge board/card game fan for ai
2010-11-20T13:49:42  <jmcarthur> not interesting to watch
2010-11-20T13:49:50  <j3camero> Some games have an upper limit to how good you can really get. Rock Paper Scissors was a big mistake for that reason.
2010-11-20T13:49:53  <jmcarthur> and i think interestingness to watch is important for getting attention
2010-11-20T13:50:13  <antimatroid1> well yeah, rps is a terrible idea for an ai contest :P
2010-11-20T13:50:14  <j3camero> You're right jmcarthur
2010-11-20T13:50:29  <j3camero> There are so many factors, and it rules out all games, haha.
2010-11-20T13:50:41  <j3camero> I have a wiki page on the criteria for good game choices
2010-11-20T13:50:54  <antimatroid1> i agree with jmcarthur about bored games
2010-11-20T13:51:02  <Migi32> jmcarthur, "was" a big mistake? You actually did a contest on RPS?
2010-11-20T13:51:19  <antimatroid1> i think it was just uw based then
2010-11-20T13:51:22  <j3camero> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/GameCriteria
2010-11-20T13:51:22  <burny> is team games a posible consideration?
2010-11-20T13:51:27  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i didn't. j3camero did :P
2010-11-20T13:51:42  <j3camero> hehe yeah my bad
2010-11-20T13:51:47  <Migi32> sorry, I get your names confused all the time :)
2010-11-20T13:52:10  <Mistmanov> I personally wouldn't like teamgames for the main competition, especially if it involves actual cooperation with other coders
2010-11-20T13:52:20  <foucist> Migi32: yeah there was a RPS contest
2010-11-20T13:52:21  <boegel> do the test servers consider multiple orders to/from the same planet a problem?
2010-11-20T13:52:28  <jmcarthur> okay, there's more than one way to do a "team" game. one way is to have each team be made up of many bots. another is to have each team be made up of multiple instances of the same bot. another is to have all the agents of each team be controlled by a single instance of each competing bot
2010-11-20T13:52:28  <burny> the teams would be random(and change each game)
2010-11-20T13:52:31  <jmcarthur> Mistmanov: ^^
2010-11-20T13:52:34  <McLeopold> j3camaro: San Juan, the card game
2010-11-20T13:52:35  <Mistmanov> having to work with others in order to climb the rankings is exactly not what i'm looking for in a contest
2010-11-20T13:52:40  <j3camero> With team games pairing would be important. I think we have to match people of similar strength.
2010-11-20T13:53:23  <jmcarthur> i think doing a team game would have a lot of subtle issues that would be difficult to solve well
2010-11-20T13:53:24  <janzert> implement trueskill for that, it is the situation it was designed for
2010-11-20T13:53:28  <burny> I think straight-up ELO scoring with random teams would be sufficient for simple team games
2010-11-20T13:53:32  <j3camero> Good point jmcarthur.
2010-11-20T13:53:40  <antimatroid1> i'd prefer to do n-player each for themseves
2010-11-20T13:53:43  <jmcarthur> team games also don't converge your rank anywhere near as quickly as, say, FFA
2010-11-20T13:54:07  <j3camero> What about a simple RTS?
2010-11-20T13:54:11  <Migi32> a team game with each team member being the player's bot that could only communicate when they're close to each other in the game-world would be interesting
2010-11-20T13:54:12  <burny> FFA generally doesn't have a meaningly useful 'best' AI though
2010-11-20T13:54:15  <j3camero> Either 1v1 or FFA
2010-11-20T13:54:18  <antimatroid1> RTS?
2010-11-20T13:54:19  <jmcarthur> j3camero: there's no such thing as a simple rts
2010-11-20T13:54:22  <j3camero> Or... MMO...
2010-11-20T13:54:31  <jmcarthur> i tried to come up with a simple rts for this one and gave up
2010-11-20T13:54:40  <j3camero> It's tough
2010-11-20T13:54:45  <j3camero> Balance would be a huge issue.
2010-11-20T13:54:46  <jmcarthur> galcon was the closest i could think of
2010-11-20T13:54:50  <Mistmanov> as in real time strategy? Isn't galcon an rts?
2010-11-20T13:54:51  <Mistmanov> yeah
2010-11-20T13:55:04  <j3camero> I'm talking more starcraft-like.
2010-11-20T13:55:04  <burny> well... an easy way to test the feasability of my idea..
2010-11-20T13:55:19  <jmcarthur> j3camero: yeah, there are so many elements to that...
2010-11-20T13:55:25  <jmcarthur> resources, building, units, etc.
2010-11-20T13:55:28  <burny> would be to take all the galcon AI bots as-is, and toss them into a random 2vs2 tournament
2010-11-20T13:55:43  <jmcarthur> cutting out any of those things, IMO, destroys it
2010-11-20T13:56:07  <burny> if the elo of 1on1, compared to the ELO of random teams, is generally fairly consistent.. then my idea clearly works
2010-11-20T13:56:12  <antimatroid1> i like the idea of people being able to execute moves when their bot is ready to
2010-11-20T13:56:15  <antimatroid1> then having no time limits
2010-11-20T13:56:23  <antimatroid1> so you'd need RTS for that
2010-11-20T13:56:24  <burny> if random team elo comes out fairly random.. then I am wrong
2010-11-20T13:56:34  <j3camero> One way to deal with the balance issue is this. There is only one type of unit, but with many parameters. It has range, damage, health, etc. This unit could be made into a tank, melee, archer, whatever. It's just different parameters. We could change the unit types and evolve it over the life of the contest to achieve balance.
2010-11-20T13:57:38  <j3camero> burny: it's not a bad idea. Try to collect people's bots after this ends and you can test it out using the contest endinge and ranking scritp.
2010-11-20T13:57:47  <jmcarthur> yeah... i thought of that too
2010-11-20T13:58:00  <antimatroid1> bots aren't written to do that
2010-11-20T13:58:11  <antimatroid1> i think mcleopold is keen to do n-player games though
2010-11-20T13:58:12  <McLeopold> Some units use a rock as a weapon, some use sissors, other go for paper cuts...
2010-11-20T13:58:13  <burny> anti: it doesn't matter.. none of them are written to do that
2010-11-20T13:58:15  <j3camero> I think buildings and resources could be cut out. It would just be a "micro" contest.
2010-11-20T13:58:30  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-20T13:58:34  <jmcarthur> rock paper scissors units aren't interesting units though :\
2010-11-20T13:58:39  <jmcarthur> that's essentially random
2010-11-20T13:59:03  <jmcarthur> j3camero: see i think that kills it right there
2010-11-20T13:59:05  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: not if you have to arrange them into effective groups
2010-11-20T13:59:12  <Migi32> jmcarthur, I watch professional starcraft games sometimes and even battles with 1 type of unit can be very interesting
2010-11-20T13:59:22  <j3camero> The big advantage that RTS has is it's sexy. It would make for some awesome game playbacks and fierce competition.
2010-11-20T13:59:23  <jmcarthur> as soon as you remove something like resource gathering then the game might as well just be micro
2010-11-20T13:59:24  <Migi32> it's about trying to surround the enemy's army
2010-11-20T13:59:34  <janzert> j3camero: Oh while you're here, I've been making the assumption that the cutoff time to start the final tournament is based on server time for the timezone
2010-11-20T13:59:37  <janzert> is that right?
2010-11-20T13:59:38  <jmcarthur> units only would be all about micro
2010-11-20T13:59:45  <burny> to make the game work as teams.. all you gota do is make your teammate appear as a neutral planet that has an extra few hundred ships on it
2010-11-20T14:00:04  <j3camero> janzert: sure :-)
2010-11-20T14:00:04  <janzert> server time is CST btw and is what displays on all the profile times and such
2010-11-20T14:00:05  <jmcarthur> burny: and what about "neutral" fleets?
2010-11-20T14:00:15  <burny> neutrals show up as is..
2010-11-20T14:00:16  <janzert> j3camero: Ok, I'll make that official then
2010-11-20T14:00:21  <burny> enemys all show up as 1
2010-11-20T14:00:25  <jmcarthur> burny: fleets
2010-11-20T14:00:29  <burny> and ally shows up as heavily populated neutrals
2010-11-20T14:00:30  <jmcarthur> burny: teammate fleets, i mean
2010-11-20T14:00:30  <Migi32> jmcarthur, allied fleets could be your fleets, there'd be no difference
2010-11-20T14:00:45  <jmcarthur> that completely changes the quality of your ai
2010-11-20T14:00:51  <burny> hm, ya.. teammate fleets could be awkward
2010-11-20T14:00:54  <jmcarthur> because you can't actually control them
2010-11-20T14:01:03  <j3camero> janzert: your plan on the forums is tight. Let's do it that way.
2010-11-20T14:01:03  <Migi32> you can't control your fleets either
2010-11-20T14:01:11  <jmcarthur> Migi32: but you can plan to when they land
2010-11-20T14:01:14  <McLeopold> maybe divide the planets up
2010-11-20T14:01:14  <burny> teammate fleets, can show up as being your own fleets
2010-11-20T14:01:18  <janzert> j3camero: great
2010-11-20T14:01:29  <burny> and if you do attack your ally.. you just give your fleets to your ally
2010-11-20T14:01:39  <Migi32> jmcarthur, no you can only control when you *send* fleets, which is the same as controlling planets only
2010-11-20T14:01:39  <burny> it clearly wouldn't be perfect..
2010-11-20T14:01:45  <j3camero> janzert: do you want to be the operator in the last few hours before the deadline, or do you want me to do it?
2010-11-20T14:01:51  <burny> but it would be a good approximation, that requires very little effort
2010-11-20T14:02:14  <jmcarthur> Migi32: when there is a fleet on the way to planet it's normally perfectly fine to plan to send them off again as soon as they land...
2010-11-20T14:02:28  <Migi32> jmcarthur, ah you mean like that. Good point
2010-11-20T14:02:52  <janzert> j3camero: I don't mind doing it and since I've had my head buried in the code for the last month plus I feel fairly confident around it
2010-11-20T14:02:56  <jmcarthur> there's also the issue of what happens when you move your own fleets to a planet owned by a teammate
2010-11-20T14:03:08  <janzert> j3camero: not that I won't forget something anyway :P
2010-11-20T14:03:15  <burny> I already said jmc.. it gives your fleets to your ally
2010-11-20T14:04:19  <j3camero> janzert: excellent. I will also be around for backup. I guess I can focus more on forums then. After last contest I thought it would be good to nominate one single "systems guy" for the last few horus, since we were all stepping all over each other inside the server.
2010-11-20T14:04:23  <jmcarthur> ah... that seems like it would throw most AIs off then
2010-11-20T14:04:41  <j3camero> janzert: im sure you'll do fine. And we all make mistakes, it's cool.
2010-11-20T14:04:42  <burny> ya, it would throw them off.. but it would be fair, and easy
2010-11-20T14:04:45  <janzert> j3camero: yeah, having one person do the transition is certainly best
2010-11-20T14:05:05  <j3camero> And I guess we'll all switch our watches to CST.
2010-11-20T14:05:06  <janzert> too many moving parts to have multiple people poking at it :)
2010-11-20T14:05:09  <j3camero> That's probably good
2010-11-20T14:05:41  <j3camero> Last contest I left it open a couple minutes past the deadline to reduce frustration. This will be basically the same deal, since many people will assume it's 11:59 PM EST.
2010-11-20T14:05:59  <antimatroid1> yeah i was going to make a comment about that
2010-11-20T14:06:02  <janzert> I'm going to change the front page to give the timezone now
2010-11-20T14:06:02  *** smloh1 <smloh1!4786e1ca@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.134.225.202> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-20T14:06:20  <antimatroid1> it's possibly worth suggesting on the main page that people upload at least a few hours before the deadline too
2010-11-20T14:06:44  <j3camero> Cool
2010-11-20T14:08:12  <foucist> what is the simplest absolute way to start generating rules or heuristics for a bot to use in this?
2010-11-20T14:08:21  <foucist> i don't want to waste my time building an engine..
2010-11-20T14:08:28  *** p4p4 <p4p4!~chatzilla@82.113.106.30> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-20T14:08:31  <antimatroid1> think about simple examples
2010-11-20T14:08:37  <antimatroid1> and work out what ships you would want to send
2010-11-20T14:08:38  <jmcarthur> foucist: download a starter pack and edit it
2010-11-20T14:08:54  <foucist> jmcarthur: yeah but then i have to code all sorts of stuff on top of that
2010-11-20T14:09:00  <jmcarthur> foucist: like what?
2010-11-20T14:09:04  <foucist> just to start generating rules/heuristics
2010-11-20T14:09:06  <jmcarthur> foucist: it gives you a working bot from the start
2010-11-20T14:09:11  <foucist> jmcarthur: i know
2010-11-20T14:09:21  <antimatroid1> i model a move with a single destination and multiple fleets, from numerious sources with different sending times
2010-11-20T14:09:26  <j3camero> foucist: have you seen the tutorials?
2010-11-20T14:09:35  <foucist> jmcarthur: well lets say i want to generate many different rules and test them..
2010-11-20T14:09:45  <foucist> j3camero: yes i have, i've gone through all that
2010-11-20T14:09:45  <janzert> front page updated
2010-11-20T14:09:54  <Migi32> foucist, you want to have a good bot without spending the time writing one?
2010-11-20T14:09:59  <foucist> j3camero: looking for a starting point to do some proper EA with this
2010-11-20T14:10:27  <foucist> Migi32: no, i just want a solid starting point to do EA/GP etc with this, but it seems that i'd have to code up an engine to handle it or something
2010-11-20T14:10:50  <j3camero> Ah okay so you are looking for a genome representation basically.
2010-11-20T14:10:53  <foucist> i want to be able to generate different rules/heurstics for the bot
2010-11-20T14:10:57  <boegel> ah, notification of who wins is a lot sooner now?
2010-11-20T14:11:04  <foucist> and mutate/etc so on
2010-11-20T14:11:05  <boegel> will the rankings be public during the testing?
2010-11-20T14:11:14  <antimatroid1> foucist: you're expected to do that stuff for yourself
2010-11-20T14:11:19  <j3camero> boeggel: not telling haha
2010-11-20T14:11:26  <foucist> antimatroid1: yeah that's what i figure
2010-11-20T14:11:28  <boegel> j3camero: ? :)
2010-11-20T14:11:29  <foucist> i thought i'd ask though
2010-11-20T14:11:32  <burny> if the bots in the 1on1 contest are ranked with ELO of x(n), and with randomly chosen teams, their ELO is y(n).  if the standard deviation of x(n) vs y(n) is less then something like.. 10-20%.. then if the AI's were properly deisgned to work in teams.. the contest would work real well
2010-11-20T14:11:37  <antimatroid1> j3camero: it would be good if they are live
2010-11-20T14:12:10  <foucist> j3camero: what do you think is there an easy way to deal with generating rules/heuristics, any proto-genome-like thing i can do etc...
2010-11-20T14:12:28  <antimatroid1> foucist: you have a week :)
2010-11-20T14:12:31  <j3camero> antimatroid1: I like the not live idea. It means more suspense.
2010-11-20T14:12:39  <foucist> antimatroid1: yep!
2010-11-20T14:12:50  <antimatroid1> j3camero: it's nowhere near as exciting as watching the leaderboard evolve
2010-11-20T14:12:51  <Migi32> foucist, I don't believe many people have explored this direction so far.
2010-11-20T14:12:53  <j3camero> foucist: let me think about that while I fry a steak for lunch.
2010-11-20T14:12:54  <foucist> antimatroid1: which is why i want to figure out something super simple
2010-11-20T14:12:55  <antimatroid1> and watching the games as they're played
2010-11-20T14:13:15  <janzert> j3camero: from what I can tell there is pretty overwhelming support in the community to leave the leaderboard live during the finals
2010-11-20T14:13:27  <janzert> and I do think it helps keep the community active while they run
2010-11-20T14:13:40  <boegel> does anyone know if the zeroviz and benzendrine server consider order sets with multiple orders to and from the same planets invalid?
2010-11-20T14:13:41  <antimatroid1> ^^ what he said
2010-11-20T14:13:59  <antimatroid1> boegel: pretty sure that's fine on both
2010-11-20T14:14:12  <janzert> on the other hand I do understand the suspense aspect but I think the negatives out way it when hiding the leaderboard
2010-11-20T14:14:22  <dmj111> boegel: i am certain that I send those kinds of orders on both.
2010-11-20T14:14:29  <boegel> antimatroid1: my experiences seem to suggest problems on the test servers
2010-11-20T14:14:46  <boegel> then I have no clue why my order sets is considered wrong :(
2010-11-20T14:14:51  <antimatroid1> let me put it this way, is it more interesting to hear the result of a *place sports name here* match, or actually watch the game and see it unfold
2010-11-20T14:15:11  <boegel> oh
2010-11-20T14:15:13  <boegel> wait
2010-11-20T14:15:16  <j3camero> Yes I think I am the only one who likes taking the leaderboard down during the finals.
2010-11-20T14:15:25  <boegel> same source/destination is probably not a good idea...
2010-11-20T14:15:32  <dmj111> yep, that is the problem :)
2010-11-20T14:15:35  <boegel> seems like the official server doesn't check on that?
2010-11-20T14:16:12  <janzert> boegel: I actually updated the spec last night since the official engine doesn't do anything about that
2010-11-20T14:16:21  <boegel> ah, k
2010-11-20T14:16:30  <boegel> janzert: so, it's OK on the official server?
2010-11-20T14:16:35  <janzert> yes
2010-11-20T14:16:37  <boegel> it's dumb though, I should fix it
2010-11-20T14:17:04  <janzert> although it won't have *any* visible effect since they just land later on the same move
2010-11-20T14:17:25  <j3camero> Honestly I think it should be up to the community to decide whether to leave the leaderboard up or down. I don't think it makes sense for me to decide that. So it looks like it will probably stay up.
2010-11-20T14:17:26  <boegel> janzert: well, you do waste budget you can spend otherwise in that turn...
2010-11-20T14:17:46  <antimatroid1> j3camero: :)
2010-11-20T14:17:53  <antimatroid1> right, i'm going to bed with that good news
2010-11-20T14:18:10  <janzert> yeah, I meant there is no way to tell from the game state afterward that those fleets existed
2010-11-20T14:18:24  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3378), Raschi(3195), _Astek_(3178), BaronTrozo(3168), _iouri_(3156), bix0r4ever(3146), wagstaff(3142), felixcoto(3125), protocolocon(3053), george(3043)
2010-11-20T14:18:37  <Migi32> how about a vote on the forums?
2010-11-20T14:18:42  <antimatroid1> boegel: i assumed you sent them to yourself because you wanted to use them there in the future?
2010-11-20T14:18:47  <j3camero> There is a bit of funny history here. The biggest reason I took it down in the past is because if I did not, there would be constant accusations of rigging. Once the final is under way, people get so sensitive about any change in their ranking. I think Accoun was a big factor in that :-)
2010-11-20T14:19:15  <antimatroid1> they have more reasons to question cheating if it's hidden i think
2010-11-20T14:19:33  <antimatroid1> because then they can't even screen shot all the gams they've had and see that they don't get removed
2010-11-20T14:19:42  <boegel> antimatroid1: no, it's a bug in my bot
2010-11-20T14:19:56  <j3camero> You're right in a sense antimatroid1. But it was all emotional. Once we took it down, people just relaxed.
2010-11-20T14:20:10  <antimatroid1> lies, it was horrible! :P
2010-11-20T14:20:35  <j3camero> And we had some peace for a few days to generate the best rankings we could.
2010-11-20T14:20:35  <antimatroid1> i had to sit around twiddling my thumbs
2010-11-20T14:21:32  <McLeopold> maybe you could show results without ranking?
2010-11-20T14:21:35  <j3camero> There was also a bit of "art" in the way we ran the tournament for Tron. I didn't want people to see that and get the wrong idea. For example, I temporarily banned all the bots except the top 50 so that they would play a round robin. It was a good idea and it worked well, but it would have casused massive panic.
2010-11-20T14:21:40  <janzert> heh, well just so everyone is forewarned once the finals start I plan on inserting ear plugs and ignoring anything everyone says until the finals are finished. :P
2010-11-20T14:22:19  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: i really liked the idea of watching the rankings evolve as well
2010-11-20T14:22:39  * janzert is afk for a while
2010-11-20T14:22:41  <j3camero> janzert we have that luxury this time around, since the tournament system is stable enough to just run by itself. We don't have to do anything heavy-handed with it that would be mistaken for rigging if it was publicly visible.
2010-11-20T14:28:00  <Migi32> how about this: we let the rankings evolve and then when the top 8 best players are known, play a regular tournament with them to determine the final winners, with matches that can be watched live,
2010-11-20T14:28:33  <Migi32> a regular tournament with winner advances to the next round, semifinals, finals and then the eventual winner
2010-11-20T14:29:14  <antimatroid1> migi32: that's a terrible idea :P
2010-11-20T14:29:37  <antimatroid1> if anything, a top x round robin will be run i think
2010-11-20T14:30:29  <antimatroid1> i think idealy the top 10 bots should play each other quite a few times each though
2010-11-20T14:30:57  <j3camero> That would be sort of like flipping a coin to choose the winner
2010-11-20T14:31:02  <Migi32> well yea the type of tournament doesn't matter I just want to watch a series of matches that end in a nail-biting finish of the first and second best bot against each other :P
2010-11-20T14:31:12  <burny> the thing that I think would be neat about 2vs2 instead of 1vs1 for a game like glacon: is it makes it so there is no 'perfect play'.. because you don't know what 50% of your team is going to do
2010-11-20T14:31:18  <antimatroid1> Migi32: that isn't fair on who had the best bot
2010-11-20T14:31:24  <j3camero> That would be really cool yes. Suspenseful. Also, the web server would be crushed.
2010-11-20T14:31:38  <antimatroid1> burny: you make it sound like 1v1 is trivial
2010-11-20T14:32:42  <burny> it nearly is
2010-11-20T14:32:44  <Migi32> burny, have you played Galcon? Even with optimal play you can lose an FFA just by having bad enemies
2010-11-20T14:32:56  <burny> yes, ffa glacon is lame
2010-11-20T14:33:20  <Migi32> 2v2 would be more or less the same if your ally is a random bot
2010-11-20T14:33:25  <burny> FFA glacon would be way better if when someone dies, whoever killed the most of their ships, gains 100 ships
2010-11-20T14:33:53  <burny> migi: different bots have different behavious though, that may or may not work well, with/against other bot types
2010-11-20T14:35:30  <burny> so, a large component of the bot.. would be making it work with the teammate
2010-11-20T14:35:49  <j3camero> How is 1v1 Galcon trivial?
2010-11-20T14:35:57  <j3camero> If this is true then you should be winning.
2010-11-20T14:36:27  <burny> because there is basically a 'perfect' strat
2010-11-20T14:36:35  <j3camero> Really?
2010-11-20T14:36:38  <j3camero> What is it?
2010-11-20T14:37:36  <j3camero> I mean, there must be a perfect strat. In principle, you could minimax this game up (accounting for the simulateneous moves). But that is not computationally feasible.
2010-11-20T14:37:40  <boegel> would you guys say the competition is more fierce on benzendrine or zeroviz?
2010-11-20T14:38:10  <burny> on teh first move, it's pretty easy to figure out what the best planets to take is
2010-11-20T14:38:30  <jmcarthur> okay, a quick sketch of my idea for a future contest: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B3_Nay8FIDhVMWMwZTZlYzYtMDI2My00ODIxLWE0NGYtOGJlMDRiYmUzZTM4&hl=en
2010-11-20T14:38:32  <burny> and if the opponent takes the same mirror'd ones.. then it's not hard to also figure out the best ones to take next
2010-11-20T14:38:34  <jmcarthur> pretty simple, really
2010-11-20T14:39:12  <jmcarthur> of course it still needs details and polish

2010-11-20T14:39:51  <jmcarthur> wat
2010-11-20T14:39:57  <jmcarthur> lemme just make it completely public
2010-11-20T14:40:05  <jmcarthur> i had set it to make the link work, but whatev
2010-11-20T14:40:22  <jmcarthur> try again
2010-11-20T14:41:08  <jmcarthur> i didn't put how you "win" in it. it could be last man standing, but i think a frag count might be more fun (along with respawns, of course)
2010-11-20T14:41:24  <Migi32> ah, works now
2010-11-20T14:41:27  <jmcarthur> that of course depends on how fast kills are in the game anyway
2010-11-20T14:41:40  <jmcarthur> if they are slow enough then last man standing might be better
2010-11-20T14:42:17  <burny> maybe making it be frags, with last man standing getting the win in case of a tie.. or an extra 1frag, or some such
2010-11-20T14:42:26  <j3camero> jmcarthur: lemme read this
2010-11-20T14:42:28  *** fmeyer <fmeyer!~fmeyer@189.100.228.254> has joined #aichallenge

2010-11-20T14:43:07  <jmcarthur> Migi32: yeah
2010-11-20T14:43:10  <jmcarthur> that's the idea
2010-11-20T14:43:16  <Zannick> it looks like latex
2010-11-20T14:43:39  <jmcarthur> Zannick: i used pandoc. it can convert between many formats. in this case i just used its markdown2pdf command, which uses latex in the backend
2010-11-20T14:43:45  <Zannick> cool
2010-11-20T14:43:56  <Migi32> I like
2010-11-20T14:44:06  <jmcarthur> Zannick: i also used pandoc to write the spec and my haskell starter thing
2010-11-20T14:44:23  <Migi32> now if every bot had a squad of shooters it'd be even more interesting
2010-11-20T14:44:27  <Zannick> i remember the spec

2010-11-20T14:45:24  <Zannick> hm
2010-11-20T14:45:32  <Migi32> not sure though
2010-11-20T14:45:37  <Zannick> i'm trying to think this through
2010-11-20T14:46:33  <Zannick> and i want to say that i'm not sure it'll be easy or fast for bots to get kills
2010-11-20T14:46:53  <Migi32> I think you have to carefully decide how fast bullets can be fired. Just setting it to 1 per turn would not work, I think
2010-11-20T14:46:58  <Zannick> it depends on how fast the bullets move
2010-11-20T14:47:02  <Migi32> exactly
2010-11-20T14:47:11  <burny> wish I could see the thing :(
2010-11-20T14:47:11  <Zannick> that's slightly different
2010-11-20T14:47:45  <j3camero> jmcarthur: how is it different from Robocode?

2010-11-20T14:50:36  <Migi32> lol, "which would be uber fun" :P
2010-11-20T14:51:25  <burny> so for bots that lose on first turn.. is there any way to tell why?
2010-11-20T14:51:53  <jmcarthur> j3camero: for one i don't think robocode has any sort of inertia or hidden information, does it?
2010-11-20T14:52:16  <Zannick> have you ever played a board game called robo rally?
2010-11-20T14:52:22  <jmcarthur> sounds familiar
2010-11-20T14:52:38  <lavalamp_> RPS map: http://tcp.zeroviz.us/zeroviz_538_19.txt.html
2010-11-20T14:52:45  <Zannick> you are racing to a series of points on a grid
2010-11-20T14:53:14  <Zannick> each bot is facing a certain direction and fires a laser in that direction after every move
2010-11-20T14:54:04  <Zannick> that's only part of it, but we could make which angle is agent is facing be the only angle they can shoot
2010-11-20T14:54:10  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-11-20T14:54:24  <Zannick> so they can accelerate, rotate, and fire
2010-11-20T14:54:31  <jmcarthur> could be tough with continuous space. might make more sense for discrete space
2010-11-20T14:54:39  <Zannick> yeah
2010-11-20T14:55:05  <jmcarthur> i really think continuous space would be cooler though because it makes game search tougher and also is more fun to watch
2010-11-20T14:55:32  <foucist> j3camero: eat your steak yet?  what if i made a BNF grammar for rules/strategies (no friggin clue here, just brainstorming), kinda like this guy did for some music generation: http://compusition.com/web/news/2008/04/23
2010-11-20T14:56:27  <Migi32> wow the zeroviz.us visualiser is really laggy on my PC
2010-11-20T14:59:46  <janzert> j3camero: You do agree that it is way too late to change the turn limit right? I just want final official word from you on it so we can put it to rest. :)
2010-11-20T15:01:06  <Zannick> there was official word from amstan already :)

2010-11-20T15:03:44  <foucist> janzert: seems like it's fixed to 200 according to topic
2010-11-20T15:04:00  <foucist> nobody would want it suddenly changed at this point would they?
2010-11-20T15:04:25  <foucist> except downwards if their ai dominates early on
2010-11-20T15:04:45  <foucist> i wonder if anyone here has an ai that would always win if only they had 500 turns?
2010-11-20T15:05:00  <janzert> foucist: yeah, I don't think we can change it at this point without major problems. I just want to hear j3camero say that. ;)
2010-11-20T15:05:18  <janzert> Since his is really the final word on it
2010-11-20T15:05:33  <foucist> "my ai may have lost to you on turn 200, but if it had been allowed infinite time it would've soundly beat yours, mwahaha!"
2010-11-20T15:05:35  <j3camero> janzert: yeah let's leave it at 200 fixed.
2010-11-20T15:05:40  <j3camero> that should be fine
2010-11-20T15:06:02  <j3camero> ...or we could change it to 50 some time this week just to mess with people :-)
2010-11-20T15:06:03  <janzert> yep, even if we could change it 200 seems to work fairly well
2010-11-20T15:06:12  <janzert> j3camero: heh, no thank you
2010-11-20T15:06:24  <j3camero> Yeah a1k0n demostrated that 200 is probably sufficient.
2010-11-20T15:06:33  <foucist> guess the issue that i'm dealing with right now is to figure out a system to represent strategies/decisions and code that up for the bot :(
2010-11-20T15:07:13  <j3camero> janzert: by the way, we just passed 5 million pageviews. *high five*
2010-11-20T15:07:15  <burny> the only 'problem' with 200.. is bots that don't take 200 into consideration
2010-11-20T15:07:28  <janzert> woot
2010-11-20T15:08:01  <burny> eg. if bot 1 has 280units and 43growth, and bot2 has 310units and 47growth, on turn 180.. bot2 might spend 100units to get a 5growth planet
2010-11-20T15:08:18  <j3camero> First it was 2500 pageviews, then 50,000, then 1.3 million, now probably 6 million or so.
2010-11-20T15:08:25  <j3camero> That's growth for you.
2010-11-20T15:08:39  <janzert> yeah, very nice
2010-11-20T15:08:54  <j3camero> Next time we have to get past 20M
2010-11-20T15:09:15  <j3camero> But that will take work, and some more creative thinking on how to turn the "Awesome" dial up to 11.

2010-11-20T15:11:23  <janzert> we're probably passing the inflection point of the sigmoid I would imagine
2010-11-20T15:11:24  <j3camero> We gotta do something crazy that nobody expects, and that everybody wants to be part of. Like if we make some sort of strategic MMO that also has an API. That could get pretty intense.
2010-11-20T15:12:53  <j3camero> Yeah the growth really slowed down this time. After a couple 20X multiples, we only grew by probably 6 times this contest. But I don't think we're anywhere close to saturating yet. In theory, why could we not have 2 million participants? There's gotta be 2 million people in the world with internet access, free time, and a bit of CS knowledge who would want to take part.
2010-11-20T15:13:54  <boegel> j3camero: I doubt the free time part :)
2010-11-20T15:14:08  <boegel> actually, I don't have (enough) free time, but I'm still competing
2010-11-20T15:14:27  <burny> because.. why bother participating, if you have no chance of coming close to winning?
2010-11-20T15:15:00  <Mistmanov> yeah this contest required quite a bit of work before you got to the point where you could be "proud" of your creation
2010-11-20T15:15:10  <boegel> burny: I'm having fun, but no chance of winning (unless the tuning of my bot that I'm doing now goes surprisingly well)
2010-11-20T15:15:20  <j3camero> I think most people who join dont have any intention of winning. But in any case, we can eliminate that factor by allowing users to create groups. So they could win their group and be a big fish in a little pond, rahter than shooting to win the global rankings.
2010-11-20T15:15:52  <Mistmanov> most users will give up if they don't get something nice within the first hour; when you can clearly see that the past 10 hours of work has given you a bot that completely and utterly sucks, it's demotivational
2010-11-20T15:16:11  <j3camero> Hmm what if we did not show the global rankings, only your ranking with respect to the people you have friended on the site. Then the global rakings are only revealed after the deadline?
2010-11-20T15:16:12  <Mistmanov> (like, if after 10 hours a human can still easily beat your bot)
2010-11-20T15:18:05  <jmcarthur> actually i disagree with that
2010-11-20T15:18:24  <jmcarthur> i think that the longer a human can beat your bot the longer it is more "obvious" how you can improve it
2010-11-20T15:18:25  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3393), _Astek_(3222), BaronTrozo(3199), Raschi(3185), _iouri_(3159), bix0r4ever(3155), wagstaff(3133), smloh1(3125), felixcoto(3091), protocolocon(3053)
2010-11-20T15:18:35  <jmcarthur> tron benefited from that property a lot
2010-11-20T15:18:47  <j3camero> Yeah Tron was a winning idea.
2010-11-20T15:18:47  <jmcarthur> it was pretty obvious where the flaws in your bot were
2010-11-20T15:18:52  <Mistmanov> sure, for people with the mindset of "I want to keep improving my thing" that's beneficial
2010-11-20T15:19:00  <Mistmanov> but if you want 20x as many participants..
2010-11-20T15:19:03  <j3camero> But now I am scared to put on Tron again, since Disney is releasing a Tron movie and we would probably get sued.
2010-11-20T15:19:25  <jmcarthur> Mistmanov: well the other thing is that when it's obvious what you need to change it's more motivating to make that change
2010-11-20T15:19:37  <jmcarthur> "just a little more" the whole time
2010-11-20T15:19:45  <burny> I thoguht the tron movie was like 2years ago?
2010-11-20T15:19:54  <jmcarthur> always feeling like you are on the verge of being the best bot ever
2010-11-20T15:20:02  <jmcarthur> burny: it's not out yet...
2010-11-20T15:20:10  <Mistmanov> true, but there's a difference between "well my bot is pretty awesome but does a dumb thing now and then" and "ok, I ain't getting anywhere"
2010-11-20T15:20:20  <jmcarthur> Mistmanov: were you around for the tron contest?
2010-11-20T15:20:23  <Mistmanov> nope
2010-11-20T15:20:36  <j3camero> IT was pretty addictive
2010-11-20T15:20:37  <jmcarthur> Mistmanov: most bots felt like they were getting somewhere, IMO
2010-11-20T15:20:50  <burny> a game that is real easy to play, could be good..
2010-11-20T15:20:51  <jmcarthur> i'd say galcon has not quite done that
2010-11-20T15:20:54  <burny> like, battleship
2010-11-20T15:21:28  <jmcarthur> battleship seems too solvable and trivial
2010-11-20T15:21:29  <j3camero> Battleship is a good idea on some criteria. Unfortunately it is trivially solvable (I think)
2010-11-20T15:21:44  <Zannick> the original tron movie is from the 80s
2010-11-20T15:21:49  <burny> it's easy to make small modifications to battleship, to make it non trivial
2010-11-20T15:21:50  <j3camero> There is an efficient and perfect strategy.
2010-11-20T15:22:00  <burny> eg. every turn, you can make 1 shot, and move 1 boat, 1 space
2010-11-20T15:22:21  <burny> or rather, make 2 or 3 shots, and move 1boat 1space
2010-11-20T15:22:46  <j3camero> Hmm what about a game where you direct a naval fleet on a large ocean, with continuous coordinates, and fog of war?
2010-11-20T15:22:56  <jmcarthur> we should do spy vs. spy! :P
2010-11-20T15:23:16  <j3camero> Part of the challenge would be to try to find your opponent without him seeing you, stalk their boats, and attack in a coordinated fashion.
2010-11-20T15:24:03  <burny> ya, that could be neat too..
2010-11-20T15:24:05  <jmcarthur> how would you see your opponent without him seeing you?
2010-11-20T15:24:26  <burny> when 2 boats are near the same co-ordinates.. it tells both players, that there is an enemy spotted near that boat
2010-11-20T15:24:34  <j3camero> Oh man. Simple RTS with fog of war, sea units, land units, varying sight ranges... ohhh boy.
2010-11-20T15:25:40  <j3camero> Or take that same naval combat idea, make it 3 dimensional instead of 2 dimensional, and set it in space.
2010-11-20T15:25:54  <j3camero> Multi-agent space naval combat.
2010-11-20T15:26:04  <Mistmanov> eh..
2010-11-20T15:26:09  <j3camero> You have fast weak ships, and slow strong ones...
2010-11-20T15:26:11  <Mistmanov> not very accessible I think.
2010-11-20T15:26:20  <Zannick> whoever programs the visualizer will hate you
2010-11-20T15:26:31  <jmcarthur> i think 3d is best avoided
2010-11-20T15:26:34  <j3camero> We can use VRML. It will be so easy.
2010-11-20T15:26:52  <jmcarthur> it unnecessarily adds so much extra complication
2010-11-20T15:26:54  <jmcarthur> boring maths and stuff
2010-11-20T15:27:00  <j3camero> Yeah true.
2010-11-20T15:27:06  <j3camero> 2D would be just as good.
2010-11-20T15:27:13  <jmcarthur> and it also makes the game feel more "open". tight quarters make it faster paced
2010-11-20T15:27:37  <jmcarthur> which is my objection to something slow like a naval fleet, too ;)
2010-11-20T15:27:49  <Mistmanov> completely unrelated question that I just thought of: are the organizers students or employees of the university of waterloo?
2010-11-20T15:27:54  <jmcarthur> not that it has to be *fast* of course
2010-11-20T15:28:14  <j3camero> It's all undergrad students (or was, until I graduated).
2010-11-20T15:28:23  <Mistmanov> ah k =)
2010-11-20T15:28:40  <j3camero> amstan is a student. he was in 1st year when he won the first GAIC
2010-11-20T15:28:53  <jmcarthur> hmm... variation of my earlier idea...
2010-11-20T15:29:25  <burny> simple old games, that aren't traditionally AI playable.. with some twists
2010-11-20T15:29:29  <burny> like, missle command..
2010-11-20T15:29:33  <jmcarthur> you can only fire in the direction you are facing, but it's a continuous laser. it won't necessarily kill you until you spend some time stuck in it
2010-11-20T15:29:43  <burny> one palyer shoots at the town, while the other player defends
2010-11-20T15:30:00  <jmcarthur> and you have a very limited speed of rotation

2010-11-20T15:31:17  <j3camero> Yeah man.
2010-11-20T15:31:37  <j3camero> If we did the visualizer a certain way, it would give whole new meaning to the expression "pissing contest"
2010-11-20T15:31:42  <jmcarthur> i think inertia would be very important
2010-11-20T15:31:50  <jmcarthur> since it would be the only way to move one way and fire another
2010-11-20T15:32:03  <jmcarthur> i guess like the way they fight in battlestar galactica

2010-11-20T15:36:20  <j3camero> And then just give it an API so people can easily bot it. Then it's all over.
2010-11-20T15:36:25  <burny> where making friends is both positive and negative..
2010-11-20T15:36:35  <burny> because you improve faster, but you also help opponents improve
2010-11-20T15:36:45  <j3camero> Yeah.
2010-11-20T15:37:29  <j3camero> I imagine people who find themselves in the same region in this huge world map would likely try to form federations, and have their bots work together. Could be pretty epic if it's well-balanced.
2010-11-20T15:38:03  <j3camero> The risk is that the best bot grows and just takes over the whole map, and instantly crushed newly spawned players.
2010-11-20T15:38:52  <burny> just make it not be pvp

2010-11-20T15:51:10  <jmcarthur> i had some novel ideas to try with it, but never got around to it
2010-11-20T15:52:33  <foucist> jmcarthur: any idea how to apply something like that to this challenge?  build a set of strategies with the grammar stuff?
2010-11-20T15:52:54  <jmcarthur> that would be part of the challenge, you know
2010-11-20T15:53:38  <foucist> how's that?  you mean it'll take work to do
2010-11-20T15:54:02  <foucist> when you say challenge there, you odn't mean 'ai challenge'
2010-11-20T15:54:23  <foucist> ?
2010-11-20T15:54:40  <jmcarthur> sure i do
2010-11-20T15:54:51  <jmcarthur> part of the challenge is inventing how the ai works
2010-11-20T15:58:27  <foucist> gotcha
2010-11-20T15:58:49  <j3camero> Maybe we should do an ai challenge about stock market trading. I basically give out a bunch of raw market tick data for testing purposes, and whoever's bot makes the most money over some test period wins!
2010-11-20T15:59:11  <j3camero> That would be great, because then I would have automated my job :-)
2010-11-20T15:59:13  <burny> lol
2010-11-20T15:59:22  <j3camero> Well, not really automated, as much as crowdsourced.
2010-11-20T15:59:24  <burny> why not just simplify it more..
2010-11-20T15:59:34  <burny> make it the "guess a number between1 and 10" game
2010-11-20T15:59:37  <burny> :P
2010-11-20T16:00:07  <lavalamp_> "Guess 1/3 of the average of everybody's guess"
2010-11-20T16:00:15  <j3camero> Haha yes some people view trading that way. Efficient market hypothesis and all that. Meh, their loss.
2010-11-20T16:00:22  <Mistmanov> isn't much of the stockmarket already done by AI?
2010-11-20T16:00:34  <j3camero> In some sense yes, in many ways no.
2010-11-20T16:00:37  <burny> j3, 'real' trading requires info other than numbers
2010-11-20T16:00:45  <Mistmanov> I remember reading something about the dow jones collapsing a while ago because all the computers went crazy
2010-11-20T16:01:01  <Mistmanov> (well, going down a bunch of points)
2010-11-20T16:01:02  <burny> mist, that was in like.. 87
2010-11-20T16:01:28  <j3camero> Most trading is done by algos these days. But that algo is under the command of a human manager. A manager will decide that wants to buy 100k shares of whatever, then the algo will do that in a way that mininmzes the market impact. So it's not really the algo that's making the market moving decisions, still a human.
2010-11-20T16:01:38  <Mistmanov> http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/business/07markets.html?_r=1&ref=global-home
2010-11-20T16:01:45  <j3camero> Also in May o this year.
2010-11-20T16:01:50  <Mistmanov> hm ok
2010-11-20T16:01:56  <mega1> j3camero: that's not the only way
2010-11-20T16:02:14  <mega1> optimizing execution is important but it's just part of the picture
2010-11-20T16:03:02  <j3camero> The idea behind the stock market AI contest would be to create the smartest money-making trading program, not to carry out someone else's order in an optimal way.
2010-11-20T16:03:26  <j3camero> Basically it would be prop trading, not agency.
2010-11-20T16:03:51  <mega1> that's the most boring game possible
2010-11-20T16:04:01  <j3camero> Not if you find something that works :-)
2010-11-20T16:04:24  <mega1> I worked a couple of years on this.
2010-11-20T16:04:25  <jmcarthur> IM a good AI contest needs competition
2010-11-20T16:04:30  <jmcarthur> *IMO
2010-11-20T16:04:38  <jmcarthur> directly competition
2010-11-20T16:05:21  <j3camero> I was talking with some of my coworkers. The idea would be to take the top 10 bots at any given time, and actually be running them in the real market in real time using real money. But we figured that the regulators would not be too happy with us if we did this! :-)
2010-11-20T16:05:56  <Mistmanov> Using someone else's code to make money would also be a bit shaky I think :p
2010-11-20T16:06:07  <Mistmanov> (assuming the bots make money..)
2010-11-20T16:06:10  <j3camero> I could just picture that meeting: "we don't actually know how the strategies work. They were submitted over the internet by anonymous people."
2010-11-20T16:07:24  <Mistmanov> but yeah, a big part of the competition is that you have direct battles between competitors
2010-11-20T16:07:41  <Mistmanov> just a big leaderboard of who made the most money is less satisfying than "I just defeated the #1 guy!"
2010-11-20T16:07:50  <Mistmanov> or "I just defeated that punk from the forums!"
2010-11-20T16:07:55  <j3camero> Yes, thats true.
2010-11-20T16:08:27  <j3camero> Maybe create a simulated market with 20 different stocks. Each bot can put bids and offers into the market.
2010-11-20T16:08:57  <j3camero> That could actually work really well if each different "stock" had some actual underlying.
2010-11-20T16:10:22  <mega1> j3camero: simulation is not easy
2010-11-20T16:10:26  <mega1> I'd say impossible.
2010-11-20T16:10:27  <j3camero> hmm is there some quantitative real-world phenomenon that we could create derivative contracts for, that the bots could trade in real time?
2010-11-20T16:10:48  <Mistmanov> sunshine!
2010-11-20T16:10:49  <j3camero> Like maybe the temperatures of major US cities or something.
2010-11-20T16:11:24  <foucist> j3camero: which regulators? i don't think SEC would have a problem with AI playing the stockmarket, since it already happens for the most part
2010-11-20T16:11:32  <foucist> s/most part/to some extent/g
2010-11-20T16:11:32  <j3camero> Or the number of pageviews each hour on the ai contest website!

2010-11-20T16:12:12  <foucist> since that's another way to make money

2010-11-20T16:12:55  <jmcarthur> also i wouldn't want to be uploading something that could be potentially making money to a server where those with access to the server could use it as they please
2010-11-20T16:13:03  <j3camero> If we're just running a strategy in the real market submitted by some random person from the internet without vetting it or knowing who they are... that would be big fines.
2010-11-20T16:13:28  <Mjothvitnir> where do you think the prize money is gonna come from
2010-11-20T16:14:03  <j3camero> Their strategy could be making money by committing all sorts of crimes, or manipulating market prices, or whatever. There's a lot of rules in the market, and they have to be respected. You have to be able to prove to the regulators that you're following the rules.

2010-11-20T16:14:37  <burny> I'm going to make my bot buy all stocks of "ABC ice cream"..

2010-11-20T16:14:59  <burny> but I've been trying to sell it for 50k$ for a few weeks now..
2010-11-20T16:15:04  <j3camero> Yeah that's just one thing that could go wrong!
2010-11-20T16:15:33  <j3camero> There's a lot of ways to make money by trading in the market. Many of them are not legal haha.
2010-11-20T16:16:21  <foucist> uh how much do you know about the stock market?
2010-11-20T16:16:41  <foucist> well i mean, what about market makers
2010-11-20T16:16:48  <foucist> anyone can make the market
2010-11-20T16:16:52  <foucist> if they have the clout
2010-11-20T16:17:21  <foucist> altho yeah there are rules around making the market
2010-11-20T16:18:24  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3395), _Astek_(3206), Raschi(3169), bix0r4ever(3160), _iouri_(3147), wagstaff(3108), felixcoto(3074), BaronTrozo(3069), protocolocon(3050), davidjliu(3042)
2010-11-20T16:19:09  <j3camero> not anyone really
2010-11-20T16:19:26  <j3camero> broker dealers have a huge advantage
2010-11-20T16:19:49  <burny> if you were going to make stock market AI.. obviously the thing to do, would be to make the ai's descisions, not effect the value..
2010-11-20T16:19:58  <j3camero> they have much lower costs (like 1/3 cent per share max, usually much less than that) vs the average joe who pays $10 per trade.
2010-11-20T16:20:15  <burny> and impose strict limits on trades(like you can't sell/buy more than 1% of a companys value in a 10minute period
2010-11-20T16:20:22  <burny> and can't own more than 25% total
2010-11-20T16:20:23  <burny> etc.

2010-11-20T16:21:35  <j3camero> I think the best thing to do with an AI trading contest would be to not use real stocks. Like I said, we could create derivatives based on some real-world indicator that updates every few minutes (like the temperatures in major US cities) and have the bots trade those. That could end up being very realistic!

2010-11-20T16:22:33  <j3camero> foucist: yeah that's pretty much the idea. Basically we would make our own version of InTrade.com, but trade things that update really often.
2010-11-20T16:22:41  <Gromgull> AIs already constitute 50% of real traded stocks today - why not just join them? :)
2010-11-20T16:23:11  <foucist> j3camero: yeah that might be interesting
2010-11-20T16:23:56  <j3camero> There would be two components: (1) how well can you predict the underlying quantity, and (2) how good is your bot at trading.
2010-11-20T16:24:07  <Mjothvitnir> can the bot access the internet (lookup forcast highs/lows) :)
2010-11-20T16:24:12  <j3camero> Yeah why not.
2010-11-20T16:24:36  <j3camero> It would have to work kind of like the TCP server model. You would run your bot on your own computer, and it would connect to the market over the internet.

2010-11-20T16:49:56  <Mjothvitnir> thanks
2010-11-20T16:50:00  <burny> are there any contendors with mersenne, for medium to high quality RNG?
2010-11-20T16:50:27  <delt0r___> burny: Lots, and are faster.... but ask tomorrow
2010-11-20T16:50:33  <delt0r___> ;_
2010-11-20T16:50:36  <delt0r___> ;)
2010-11-20T16:50:54  <burny> why tomorrow? busy?
2010-11-20T16:52:14  <Mistmanov> can you run multiple bots with the same name on the tcp server?
2010-11-20T16:52:35  <Mistmanov> compare http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=flanders.28b and http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=mistmanov
2010-11-20T16:52:41  <Naktibalda> yes, you can
2010-11-20T16:52:50  <Mistmanov> I've got a solid block of flanders as opponent, but he has loads of other opponents in between
2010-11-20T16:53:03  <Mistmanov> ah ok. Well, that explains why I'm constantly playing against him -_-
2010-11-20T16:53:21  <foucist> does anyone here know much or deal much with generating grammars of player actions with this ai challenge?
2010-11-20T16:53:44  <foucist> FSMs? BNF? transducers? :P

2010-11-20T17:34:03  <burny> and it's at just 12 right now
2010-11-20T17:34:12  <burny> and it's climbing up super slow

2010-11-20T17:38:15  <burny> it's low cause I had a bunch of broken code before
2010-11-20T17:38:19  <burny> so I lost like 200 in a row
2010-11-20T17:38:48  <McLeopold> use a new name
2010-11-20T17:38:51  <janzert> yeah, I'd like to watch it climb actually
2010-11-20T17:38:55  <medrimonia> I think that you'll climb up "fast enough" with the system
2010-11-20T17:39:00  <janzert> please don't
2010-11-20T17:39:01  <burny> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=13271
2010-11-20T17:39:24  <McLeopold> oh, on official?, nvm
2010-11-20T17:39:25  <burny> ya.. it's 'fast enough'.. but I'd rather not have to wait a couple hours lol
2010-11-20T17:39:53  <medrimonia> hmmm in fact...
2010-11-20T17:40:00  <McLeopold> janzert: put up a paypal site, allow donation's of $10 to reset an elo
2010-11-20T17:40:20  <janzert> ahh, heh you've removed our 0 elo anchor :P
2010-11-20T17:40:33  <medrimonia> I think that the problem is that you're playing against people with very low elo
2010-11-20T17:41:16  <burny> med.. obviously..
2010-11-20T17:41:20  <burny> thus the desire to 'reset it'
2010-11-20T17:41:34  <foucist> burny: but your bot will get stronger beating up the weak
2010-11-20T17:41:35  <janzert> you've already gain about 100 ranks :)
2010-11-20T17:41:42  <foucist> and it'll be warmed up for teh stronger opponents
2010-11-20T17:41:51  <burny> lol foucist
2010-11-20T17:41:56  <burny> if only that were the case
2010-11-20T17:42:09  <foucist> what! your bot doesn't operate on anime principles? ;)
2010-11-20T17:42:27  <burny> not until it's ELO get's high enough..
2010-11-20T17:42:28  <McLeopold> janzert: he's not getting real games?
2010-11-20T17:42:33  <burny> has to be atleast 9000
2010-11-20T17:42:45  <foucist> heh
2010-11-20T17:42:59  <foucist> isn't the highest 3400 right now?
2010-11-20T17:43:04  <burny> so I'm 3 for 3.. beat someone who's ranked 4289.. and I'm 4307?
2010-11-20T17:43:08  <McLeopold> I don't think those should count against his last played time.
2010-11-20T17:43:19  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm?
2010-11-20T17:43:26  <McLeopold> nikiburny
2010-11-20T17:43:32  <McLeopold> 3 games, all crashes
2010-11-20T17:44:33  <janzert> they have to though or all the ones just above the crash bots will be playing a huge number of games
2010-11-20T17:44:44  <McLeopold> and that's bad?
2010-11-20T17:44:49  <janzert> yes
2010-11-20T17:44:58  <janzert> it'll starve the rest of the bots
2010-11-20T17:45:04  <McLeopold> I don't think it will
2010-11-20T17:45:11  <medrimonia> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1111418
2010-11-20T17:45:16  <McLeopold> the play who didn't crash get's a game right away
2010-11-20T17:45:24  <medrimonia> I almost losted this one, really funny
2010-11-20T17:45:27  <McLeopold> if they get a real game, then they are out of the queue
2010-11-20T17:45:40  <McLeopold> it wouldn't affect the pairings too much
2010-11-20T17:46:02  <janzert> why skew it
2010-11-20T17:46:27  <janzert> but I am wondering why it is taking so long for him to get paired again
2010-11-20T17:46:43  <burny> make it skew, only until 10 games are played(or there's atleast 2losses and 2wins)
2010-11-20T17:46:50  <McLeopold> it should be skewed for working bots
2010-11-20T17:47:12  <McLeopold> a bot that crashes all the time, should only play half the time, which this would do
2010-11-20T17:47:12  <janzert> but it will be skewed toward partially working and really low ranked working bots
2010-11-20T17:47:24  <janzert> no it wouldn't
2010-11-20T17:47:30  <McLeopold> if a bot crashes 50%, then they won't play as much, maybe 75%, but it's still better.
2010-11-20T17:47:30  <burny> my recomendation would be..
2010-11-20T17:47:41  <janzert> even the crash all the time bots would play more than the top of the rankings
2010-11-20T17:47:48  <burny> when a new bot enters: let it play more often, until it has won2 games, and lost 2 games: or played a total of 10games
2010-11-20T17:47:51  <medrimonia> a bot that has more than 50% crashes shouldn't play more than 10 games I thinks
2010-11-20T17:47:57  <McLeopold> janzert: I don't think we are on the same page with my idea
2010-11-20T17:48:19  <medrimonia> more than 10 games at all
2010-11-20T17:48:23  <McLeopold> janzert: crash bot does not replay, his opponent does
2010-11-20T17:48:39  <janzert> yes, but chances are better than average that he will play another crash bot
2010-11-20T17:48:52  <McLeopold> so if both crash, then no replay
2010-11-20T17:48:58  <McLeopold> they still get their turns
2010-11-20T17:49:09  <McLeopold> It's just bots that don't crash get a real turn
2010-11-20T17:49:11  <janzert> since if you were likely to play a crash bot to start with you are still likely to play one again
2010-11-20T17:49:15  <burny> I agree, about not making low rank bots play more... but when they(and anyone else also), re-submit.. they should get more plays, at first
2010-11-20T17:49:27  <McLeopold> no, the rank would go up into the good bot range
2010-11-20T17:49:27  <medrimonia> (maybe I don't see something, but I can't see what's the interest of letting bot who crashes every game play)
2010-11-20T17:49:43  <burny> leo.. really bad bots that don't crash, wouldn't go up
2010-11-20T17:49:52  <McLeopold> true
2010-11-20T17:49:58  <janzert> ranks only recalculate every 15 minutes so not likely if you are playing these games back to back
2010-11-20T17:50:01  <McLeopold> but at least they would get some good games
2010-11-20T17:50:19  <burny> and how do you tell the difference?.. the only way I see, is that bots with low total games played, get favoued in playing matches in general
2010-11-20T17:50:24  <McLeopold> then schedule the bot for after the next rank change
2010-11-20T17:51:03  <janzert> burny: a burst of games at resubmit would tend to incentivize people to resubmit as frequently as possible and starve the long term submissions
2010-11-20T17:51:05  <burny> really, if someone has a crummy bot, and loses 3/4 good games, and wins 6 crash bots.. they have enough info to improve themselves
2010-11-20T17:51:35  <burny> jan: they would only get 4 games bursted
2010-11-20T17:51:42  <burny> and would lose all their history
2010-11-20T17:51:52  <burny> or heck, make it be until they have 1win and 1loss
2010-11-20T17:51:59  <janzert> yes, and it's 4 times more than they would get otherwise
2010-11-20T17:52:11  <burny> well, still.. so what?
2010-11-20T17:52:23  <burny> if someoen is actively participating, and wants to see what it's doing..
2010-11-20T17:52:36  <medrimonia> But isn't it possible to simply get out of the schedule the bots who crashed 10 times in a row?
2010-11-20T17:52:38  <McLeopold> janzert: i would suggest getting a game against a crashed bot is not getting a game
2010-11-20T17:52:39  <burny> why not let them get more games played, than someone who is waiting until tomorrow to see what's up?
2010-11-20T17:53:21  <burny> how does winning against someone ranked 4289, make me be 4307 though?
2010-11-20T17:53:22  <janzert> I want to incentivize resubmission only when the player thinks he has made real changes, even the pairing of new submission at there old levels is kinda shaky
2010-11-20T17:53:24  <McLeopold> janzert: I think the definition of "garenteed a game" should be a game that is actually played.
2010-11-20T17:54:03  <burny> what if the bot sucks REAL bad.. and can't come close to beating any other non-crash bot?
2010-11-20T17:54:33  <burny> or, heck..

2010-11-20T17:54:44  <janzert> we're going to have to disagree on it, but for sure in the next contest hopefully crash bots will be eliminated before they make it into the main competition
2010-11-20T17:54:44  <burny> only allow the burst to happen up to once per hour
2010-11-20T17:54:51  <janzert> i.e. they will be failed submissions
2010-11-20T17:55:44  <janzert> burny: yeah, there are a lot of complexities that would need to be added on to make it work fairly and it's certainly not something I'm going to dig into now
2010-11-20T17:56:02  <janzert> it's definitely a realm fraught with unintended consequences
2010-11-20T17:56:04  <burny> ya, I wasn't sugesting it happen 'right now' :P
2010-11-20T17:56:26  <McLeopold> janzert: I'll suggest a scheme on the behind the scenes forum later, but I think I could get something to be fair and work.

2010-11-20T17:58:00  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, with that paypal site, a $10 donations gets you 5 extra games instantly. :P
2010-11-20T17:58:07  <janzert> hehe
2010-11-20T17:58:09  <burny> lol leo
2010-11-20T17:58:53  <burny> I think that anything that allows people who are actually LOOKING at the resuls of current games, to get more current games.. is a good thing
2010-11-20T17:58:57  <janzert> btw, burny your bot last game is 2 minutes more recent than the current least recent submission so should play any time now
2010-11-20T17:59:20  <janzert> and there it went
2010-11-20T17:59:24  <McLeopold> can we see that?
2010-11-20T17:59:36  <janzert> and you got 3 turns :/
2010-11-20T17:59:39  <McLeopold> that would be nice. "1000 people ahead of you in the queue"
2010-11-20T18:00:14  <McLeopold> for what it's worth, I would have called the game for him at 2 turns
2010-11-20T18:00:25  <janzert> hmm, except you will get an "early" game half the time
2010-11-20T18:00:50  <McLeopold> who will?
2010-11-20T18:00:51  <burny> so I get a game roughly every 25mins?
2010-11-20T18:00:55  <janzert> everyone
2010-11-20T18:01:02  <burny> and it'll take about.. 8hours, before I have a 'real' game?

2010-11-20T18:02:18  <burny> goody
2010-11-20T18:02:28  <McLeopold> it get the rank thing though, you would have to start climbing instantly to pull yourself out of the "crash zone"
2010-11-20T18:02:38  <janzert> burny: you've climbed over 100 ranks already
2010-11-20T18:02:49  <janzert> you were dead last right?
2010-11-20T18:02:52  <burny> no
2010-11-20T18:02:59  <burny> lots of other bots were crashing all the time too
2010-11-20T18:02:59  <McLeopold> Maybe truescore until the final contest, then bayeselo?
2010-11-20T18:03:11  <janzert> oh, you must have bumped up before the resubmission
2010-11-20T18:03:34  <janzert> I remember seeing you as last at one point
2010-11-20T18:04:02  <McLeopold> janzert: how about 24 hours results to produce elo for rankings, but 72 hour results shown?
2010-11-20T18:04:23  <McLeopold> then you can select better matches because of faster rank updates?
2010-11-20T18:04:51  <janzert> McLeopold: the database isn't really setup for it
2010-11-20T18:05:13  <burny> jan, any chance you can manually reset my rank?
2010-11-20T18:05:13  <McLeopold> :(
2010-11-20T18:05:29  <janzert> but yeah, there are other reasons I'd like to split the ranking calculation for display and the calculation for pairing
2010-11-20T18:05:59  <McLeopold> janzert: I suppose the "fix" to make good bots play near their last rank is bad for bad bots?
2010-11-20T18:06:00  <janzert> I would like to include LOS in display but it takes another 15 minutes to calculate
2010-11-20T18:06:09  <McLeopold> LOS?
2010-11-20T18:06:14  <janzert> McLeopold: yes, basically
2010-11-20T18:06:40  <janzert> well, bad in the sense that their author's won't like it
2010-11-20T18:06:49  <McLeopold> you could cap it a zero
2010-11-20T18:06:49  <janzert> likelihood of superiority
2010-11-20T18:07:10  <burny> bad bots should play against bad bots.. but if they become non-bad, they should be able to climb ranks hella faster than currently
2010-11-20T18:07:35  <McLeopold> Okay, well, I think burny not getting a full game is really unfair.  Even though I'm not sure the best way to fix it.
2010-11-20T18:08:09  <janzert> I really don't think the current rate is that bad although I can understand your frustration and I think you'll be getting full games within the next few cycles
2010-11-20T18:08:30  <burny> even if it's a full round against a suck bot.. it tells me nothing
2010-11-20T18:08:49  <McLeopold> other than you don't suck
2010-11-20T18:09:00  <McLeopold> which we still can't tell :P
2010-11-20T18:09:11  <burny> well.. in my opinion it sucks..
2010-11-20T18:09:24  <burny> but subjectively, it sucks WAY less than it used to
2010-11-20T18:09:51  <burny> assuming my bot is perfect, and NEVER loses..
2010-11-20T18:09:58  <burny> how long is it gona take to get up to rank 1?
2010-11-20T18:10:03  <burny> 7weeks?
2010-11-20T18:10:24  <janzert> no, you're rate of climb won't be linear if you don't lose ever

2010-11-20T18:10:41  <burny> I recall someone saying something about beating a bot with a lower rating then themselves, and that reducing their elo
2010-11-20T18:11:06  <burny> isn't the begining suposed to be the easiest?
2010-11-20T18:11:28  <McLeopold> yeah, but they skewed the bots you start against
2010-11-20T18:11:34  <janzert> burny: it shouldn't although there can be that appearance depending on what past games happen to get removed in the same ranking cycle
2010-11-20T18:11:43  <medrimonia1> I've seen some players getting into top top 50 without having play a game against someone of the top50.
2010-11-20T18:12:16  <medrimonia1> I think that once you'll be playing real games, if you don't lose too much, you'll start climbing fast enough
2010-11-20T18:12:36  <burny> I anticipate being around a 1200-1400elo
2010-11-20T18:13:10  <burny> maybe more like 160.. I duno

2010-11-20T20:00:00  <burny> Most likely to play next game within the next 4377 games.  (approximately 280games per minute)
2010-11-20T20:00:30  <janzert> the games per minute regularly varies between 40 and 170 for the 5 minute running average
2010-11-20T20:01:37  <janzert> so telling them what it happens to be now can be quite misleading
2010-11-20T20:01:38  <burny> well, it looks like roughly 35minutes per 2200games to me

2010-11-20T20:05:11  <burny> oh, it processes it in order, top to bottom?
2010-11-20T20:05:11  <janzert> no but game times do
2010-11-20T20:05:28  <janzert> sort of
2010-11-20T20:05:53  <janzert> it always takes the player that has played least recently for the first player and then pairs them with someone else
2010-11-20T20:06:18  <janzert> which is basically a virtual queue
2010-11-20T20:06:29  <burny> isn't that order fairly random?
2010-11-20T20:07:11  <janzert> it sorts itself out since you are more likely to play someone near your rank for the second player
2010-11-20T20:07:25  <janzert> so people in rank will tend to have played around the same times last

2010-11-20T21:04:29  <burny> when did that change?
2010-11-20T21:04:42  <medrimonia> That was like that from the beginning
2010-11-20T21:04:43  <burny> swear I rmember someone saying growthrate is always >=1 and <=5
2010-11-20T21:05:07  <medrimonia> The central planet can have a growth_rate of zero
2010-11-20T21:05:15  <burny> k..
2010-11-20T21:05:21  <medrimonia> but for the others it's between 1 and five
2010-11-20T21:05:21  <burny> gona fix that then
2010-11-20T21:05:23  <Mjothvitnir> center planet can have 0, rest are 1-5
2010-11-20T21:05:33  <medrimonia> I hope that helps^^

2010-11-20T21:16:14  <foucist> defend, act, do nothing, etc
2010-11-20T21:16:21  <burny> divide by 0 should generat a exception error.. which is silently ignored

2010-11-20T21:20:41  <burny> java I'm sure does also
2010-11-20T21:23:22  <Mjothvitnir> ah, well if you turn off exceptions then there you go.  The server doesn't use your makefile
2010-11-20T21:23:30  <j3camero> I am looking into the possibility of creating a contest that is based on prediction markets. Sort of like InTrade.com except with play money. The bot that makes the most money during the tournament period wins. However, I need something to make the prediction markets about. I was thinking weather, but that's crappy because it's so well-predicted already. It would be non-trivial to beat the existing predictions.
2010-11-20T21:24:07  <j3camero> I was also thinking the Hourly Ontario Energy Price, but that's also pretty well-studied in terms of prediction.
2010-11-20T21:24:29  <burny> 100 random stocks?
2010-11-20T21:24:48  <burny> let the contest run for 2 days...
2010-11-20T21:25:01  <burny> oen day, it gets to record info about performance..
2010-11-20T21:25:05  <burny> day2, it gets to buy+sell
2010-11-20T21:25:17  <j3camero> That's another idea. My big problem with stocks is that all the free data is delayed by 15 or 20 minutes. You can pay for real-time data. Also, it's really non-trivial to get any kind of predictive accuracy for stocks.
2010-11-20T21:25:49  <burny> it doesnt have to be live
2010-11-20T21:25:52  <j3camero> So I could kick the dick off of everybody just by paying for real-time data.
2010-11-20T21:26:31  <burny> why would predictive info matter?
2010-11-20T21:26:45  <j3camero> Still the issue with stock prices is that they're so hard to predict. I would like to choose something that is a little more tractable. Weather and energy prices are good that way, but they have been studied a lot, and there are good froecasts available already.
2010-11-20T21:26:45  <burny> you can even run it on 50year old data.. who cares
2010-11-20T21:27:35  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.85.83> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2010-11-20T21:27:41  <burny> but ya.. I agree the randomness makes it a semi non-interesting problem for doing in a week or less
2010-11-20T21:27:46  <j3camero> We could use old data. But if people are runnign their own bots and connecting in to the market over the internet, there's not much to stop them from cheating.
2010-11-20T21:28:00  <Mjothvitnir> Ah, just type jeff's info into one of those biorythm generators and use that
2010-11-20T21:28:10  <j3camero> aha
2010-11-20T21:28:22  <burny> oh...
2010-11-20T21:28:31  <burny> I thought you were gona run it on a server
2010-11-20T21:28:40  <j3camero> Like, I am looking for something live which has some predictibility, but which would be interesting to have more accurate predictions for.
2010-11-20T21:29:13  <j3camero> And which occasionally deviates from its predited behavior, you know, to give the market a bit of a kick.
2010-11-20T21:29:20  <burny> ANY live update info, can be cheated easily
2010-11-20T21:29:28  <burny> just by having a better connection than the server
2010-11-20T21:29:53  <burny> not to mention.. if it's run not on the server..
2010-11-20T21:29:59  <burny> then you don't even need ai
2010-11-20T21:31:01  <j3camero> So the way I think I'll make it work is to have a market for, say, the temperature in downtown Toronto at 11 AM sharp. We would have a seperate market for each hour. The markets would each open 48 hours before their event deadline, and close a few minutes after the true figure gets reported by the weather network.
2010-11-20T21:31:27  <j3camero> So you can actually make money by having a better predeiction algorithm.

2010-11-20T21:33:21  <j3camero> MAybe something to do with Twitter?
2010-11-20T21:33:23  <foucist> so something unique that would be fun to predict that work hasn't really been done in before
2010-11-20T21:33:26  <foucist> ooh
2010-11-20T21:33:29  <j3camero> Like, how many people tweet about X each hour?

2010-11-20T21:33:41  <foucist> and do what?
2010-11-20T21:34:01  <foucist> predict how many ppl will predict in hour 10 based on how many tweets in the first hour and the second hour?
2010-11-20T21:34:01  <j3camero> Ideally, it would also be something that would produce a reasonably disorderly market at some times, just to spice it up.
2010-11-20T21:34:09  <foucist> er
2010-11-20T21:34:11  <foucist> twweet*
2010-11-20T21:34:13  <foucist> in hour 10
2010-11-20T21:34:35  <Mjothvitnir> pump&dump!!
2010-11-20T21:34:50  <j3camero> What about how many blog posts will be published on Blogger.com for each day? That's easy to measure using their firehose.
2010-11-20T21:35:00  <j3camero> Yeah I want to see pump and dumps. Exactly.
2010-11-20T21:35:19  <j3camero> I want this market to be like the wild west. People just trying to take each other's moeny away. But it has to have some sort of underlying.
2010-11-20T21:35:44  <j3camero> Like weather, tweets, energy prices, etc...
2010-11-20T21:36:06  <j3camero> If there was some good source for how many murders there are in the USA each day, that would be the best thing.
2010-11-20T21:36:18  <foucist> tweet would be easy to artifciially inflate though
2010-11-20T21:36:30  <foucist> if there was money on the line
2010-11-20T21:36:32  <j3camero> People would be crawling news sites looking for stories about murders to try to get an idea how many murders there will be today.
2010-11-20T21:36:41  <foucist> trivial to add a thousand tweet accounts and tweet about X
2010-11-20T21:36:42  <Mjothvitnir> I ain't gonna pump&dump that one...
2010-11-20T21:37:22  <j3camero> foucist: and if this market causes the disorderly behavior to spill over to the rest of the internet, that would be kind of fun to watch too :-)
2010-11-20T21:37:23  <burny> numbe rof murders?..
2010-11-20T21:37:28  <burny> that's gota be the easiest oen to cheat
2010-11-20T21:37:38  <foucist> j3camero: i'd be surprised there isn't some semi-decent source of the daily death rate for some portion of usa or some other country..
2010-11-20T21:38:00  <Mjothvitnir> HEADLINE NEWS: "Muder Contest Owner Murdered" "In a strange twist of fate today....."
2010-11-20T21:38:05  <j3camero> It's gotta be something we can measure pretty much live, or at regular intervals of at most a day.
2010-11-20T21:38:13  <j3camero> ahaha
2010-11-20T21:38:21  <j3camero> Yeah k so maybe not murders.
2010-11-20T21:38:44  <j3camero> But some other daily reported number that you need to crawl news to predict/measure in real time.\
2010-11-20T21:39:11  <foucist> how about the number of tachyons that get measured by that detector
2010-11-20T21:39:24  <j3camero> Is it published?
2010-11-20T21:39:24  <foucist> iirc there's only a few tachyons measured daily or something
2010-11-20T21:39:29  <foucist> nah no idea
2010-11-20T21:39:32  <j3camero> Ooo that would be good.
2010-11-20T21:39:48  <j3camero> Is there any kind of pattern, or is it the world's best random number generator?
2010-11-20T21:40:08  <foucist> i think it's tied to the sun's behavior to some extent
2010-11-20T21:40:16  <foucist> or maybe not

2010-11-20T21:40:35  <j3camero> Oh that could be cool.
2010-11-20T21:40:47  <j3camero> I did some work on predicting solar activity when I was at CNRC.
2010-11-20T21:41:00  <foucist> maybe i was htining neutrinos actually
2010-11-20T21:41:04  <foucist> thinking*
2010-11-20T21:41:23  <foucist> yeah
2010-11-20T21:42:25  <j3camero> I was just reading about Tachyons on Wikipedia and it was not clear if they even exist haha.
2010-11-20T21:42:35  <burny> oi.. like 12/13 now, and still uber low elo
2010-11-20T21:42:42  <foucist> j3camero: yeah i meant neutrinos :P
2010-11-20T21:43:00  <foucist> not seeing any online source for daily measurements
2010-11-20T21:43:31  <foucist> what else to measure/predict
2010-11-20T21:43:40  <foucist> i guess there's seismic measurements out there
2010-11-20T21:43:40  <burny> it seems like the games prior to a submission, count
2010-11-20T21:44:32  <j3camero> seismic stuff would be great actually. It's probably pretty well-studied.
2010-11-20T21:44:42  <foucist> yeah
2010-11-20T21:45:02  <j3camero> Think of what open APIs we know of.
2010-11-20T21:45:18  <j3camero> I was thinking traffic on a couple major highways in Los Angeles might do it.
2010-11-20T21:45:29  <foucist> hmm
2010-11-20T21:45:46  <foucist> and do what with that kind of info?
2010-11-20T21:46:05  <foucist> traffic control is pretty well studied as well..
2010-11-20T21:46:11  <j3camero> So you have a market for a contract about traffic on a certain highway at a certain time in the future. At that moment, it pays the amount of traffic (in play dollars) to anyone who is long the contract, and people who are short the contract have to pay the same amount.
2010-11-20T21:46:17  <burny> prediction stuff isn't very 'fun' for most people :P
2010-11-20T21:46:36  <foucist> yeah true
2010-11-20T21:46:45  <foucist> what about something else altogether..
2010-11-20T21:47:05  <j3camero> That's true burny. I am just playing with the idea, in case we can think of a good way to put together some kind of totally disorderly crazy market for people to trade in.
2010-11-20T21:47:15  <j3camero> And have an API for these markets as well so people can bot it.
2010-11-20T21:47:51  <burny> if anything.. I'd say what to do is..
2010-11-20T21:47:54  <Zannick> i'd honestly rather keep seeing more games :/
2010-11-20T21:47:56  <foucist> AI can solve other types of problems, like answering questions about some knowledge base, or generating a human competitive algorithm or mechanical design etc
2010-11-20T21:48:03  <burny> blend together competing bot's supply vs demand, and RL values
2010-11-20T21:48:15  <Zannick> like individual competitions
2010-11-20T21:48:19  <foucist> burny: good idea
2010-11-20T21:48:23  <foucist> sort of like an economic game
2010-11-20T21:48:34  <foucist> hmm
2010-11-20T21:48:38  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~quassel@cpc5-heme9-2-0-cust144.9-1.cable.virginmedia.com> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-11-20T21:48:43  <j3camero> Like it would be awesome if there was a contest where people could write trading algorithms. People would try pump and dumps, they would try to corner markets, spread false rumors, it would be nuts. And also fun for me to watch given that I work in finance. But before it can be any fun, there needs to be some sort of real-world thing that the cotnracts are linked to.
2010-11-20T21:48:54  <burny> so, stock market for instance.. if it's at 54$ and going to go to 56$.. and most people can predict that.. make it go up, as people buy it.. then down as people sell it
2010-11-20T21:49:46  <burny> and instead of 'real' stocks.. it can be based on a shaped RNG
2010-11-20T21:50:04  <burny> use an RNG to control specific types of changes in the value
2010-11-20T21:50:12  <j3camero> burny yeah thats how a real stock market works. People put in orders, and trade with each other, and the price is formed that way.
2010-11-20T21:50:22  <burny> eg. rate of increase or decrease, spike's, etc.
2010-11-20T21:50:37  <j3camero> But what's the fun if the prices move about randomly?
2010-11-20T21:50:54  <j3camero> Then there's no use buying or selling. There's no way to predict it.
2010-11-20T21:51:05  <lavalamp_> please do the trading thing... that way I won't be tempted to particiapte and can have my life back...
2010-11-20T21:51:11  <burny> j3, I mean.. that if RL says "it went from 54 to 56".. and in game, people buy it at 100.. it will go up to 120 instead of 114
2010-11-20T21:51:30  <j3camero> Oh okay I see.
2010-11-20T21:52:03  <Mjothvitnir> (lavalamp_, my wife is thinking the same thing)
2010-11-20T21:52:20  <j3camero> Yeah we always get people saying that their wives hate the contest.
2010-11-20T21:52:23  <burny> so it's an artificial combination, of RL data(or randomly generated data).. and the supply+demand of competing bots
2010-11-20T21:52:56  <j3camero> burny have you seen prediction markets?
2010-11-20T21:52:57  <burny> j3, if the data is generated randomly..
2010-11-20T21:53:18  <burny> you make it be SHAPED random.. shaped according to a specific set of functions, that are public knowledge
2010-11-20T21:54:12  <j3camero> I see I see.
2010-11-20T21:54:26  <j3camero> So people would still take bets.
2010-11-20T21:54:39  <burny> eg.   random controllers r# are pure random.. Value[n+1] = value[n] + rate_of_change[n]  rate_of_change[n] += r0
2010-11-20T21:54:44  <burny> would be a super easy to predict method
2010-11-20T21:55:03  <burny> and maybe.. after r1 seconds.. the direction changes
2010-11-20T21:55:05  <burny> etc.
2010-11-20T21:55:59  <burny> so they know the TYPE of behaviour, but don't know what competing bots are doing, and don't know what the state of the functions are
2010-11-20T21:56:06  <j3camero> So this is a market where the price for buyers and sellers is controlled by the market itself. There is "a price" at which anyone can buy or sell?
2010-11-20T21:56:35  <burny> yes, but that price goes up according to some combination of 'value' and 'demand'
2010-11-20T21:56:47  <j3camero> Gotcha.
2010-11-20T21:56:56  <j3camero> So sort of like the real stock market.
2010-11-20T21:57:44  <j3camero> Why not just make it work like the actual stock market though? People put in their orders and the price emerges as an emergent property.
2010-11-20T21:57:55  <burny> maybe make SOME info about the stocks be public..
2010-11-20T21:57:57  <lavalamp_> my bot lost its mind: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1115066
2010-11-20T21:57:58  <lavalamp_> :/
2010-11-20T21:58:03  <burny> like, the total numbe rof stocks traded
2010-11-20T21:58:13  <burny> but no indication of wether people are buyign or selling
2010-11-20T21:58:24  <j3camero> Right.
2010-11-20T21:58:39  <antimatroid1> j3camero: why are you so interested in a prediction contest?
2010-11-20T21:59:08  <antimatroid1> and ideally, shouldn't it be something non completely random if you want people to win not just by pure luck
2010-11-20T21:59:19  <j3camero> So still, it's ultimately the RNG that makes the underlying value of the contracts go up and down, even if supply and demand pushes around the price in the short term. Why not link the value to some real-world process like weather?
2010-11-20T21:59:22  <burny> yes.. shaped random
2010-11-20T22:00:15  <burny> the only problem with weather, is it's a highly known/predictable thing
2010-11-20T22:00:25  <burny> we would want something that's only semi predictable
2010-11-20T22:00:50  <j3camero> antimatroid1: yeah I want to create instruments that have an underlying value, and then let people connect to the market electornically and trade in it. So you would have a market for a contract that pays the temperature in downtown Toronto at 11 AM on a certain date. The expected value of the contract would fluctuate as people's predictions change.
2010-11-20T22:01:14  <burny> eg. if the formula says that when a stock is going up, it can be anywhere from 30seconds to 25minutes before it goes down..
2010-11-20T22:01:14  <j3camero> Although not weather. Something non-boring.
2010-11-20T22:01:31  <antimatroid1> alright, i'll put some thought into something like that
2010-11-20T22:01:43  <antimatroid1> although weather prediction sounds boring as well to me :)
2010-11-20T22:01:49  <burny> then you have to determine, better thene everyone else.. both when it will go down, and when everyone else thinks it will go down
2010-11-20T22:01:58  <antimatroid1> hell*
2010-11-20T22:02:35  <antimatroid1> hmm, have you guys played guess half the average?
2010-11-20T22:02:43  <j3camero> One idea I had was to have hourly contracts for the Ontario Hourly Energy Price. They pay out the reported value when the contracts expire. So you have to decide what you think the reported value will be based on real-world information, and then trade it in a double-auction market (just like the real stock market)
2010-11-20T22:02:45  <burny> no
2010-11-20T22:02:47  <antimatroid1> it's fairly trivial in the end, but something like that?
2010-11-20T22:03:10  <antimatroid1> burny: you take n people, they each guess a number, the person closest to half the average wins
2010-11-20T22:03:32  <j3camero> Does this not encourage people to guess as low as possible?
2010-11-20T22:03:39  <antimatroid1> the equilibrium is for everyone to say 0
2010-11-20T22:03:46  <j3camero> Yeah
2010-11-20T22:03:52  <Mjothvitnir> after the first couple of rounds.
2010-11-20T22:03:52  <antimatroid1> j3camero: yeah, like i said that example is trivial, but the concept is cool
2010-11-20T22:03:58  <j3camero> Then if someone defects and says 1 then they pretty much insta-lose.
2010-11-20T22:03:59  <burny> no constraints atall on the range?
2010-11-20T22:04:11  <antimatroid1> i think people usually cap it at 100
2010-11-20T22:04:15  <antimatroid1> and 0 min
2010-11-20T22:04:27  <j3camero> I could see it.
2010-11-20T22:04:31  <antimatroid1> would it be harder if you removed 0?
2010-11-20T22:04:42  <burny> so.. if you pick non 0, you lose.. unless more than half the people decide to lose?
2010-11-20T22:04:57  <j3camero> A similar game is LUPI. Least unique positive integer. You take n people people and every says a natural number. Whoever says the lowest *unique* number wins the round.
2010-11-20T22:05:05  <Mjothvitnir> depends on what half of one is
2010-11-20T22:05:33  <lavalamp_> [15:00] <lavalamp_> "Guess 1/3 of the average of everybody's guess"
2010-11-20T22:06:27  <burny> anti: no, it wouldn't
2010-11-20T22:06:41  <lavalamp_> it would have to be iterated to make sacrificing a round worth it ocasionally
2010-11-20T22:06:59  <lavalamp_> that game also would make my wife happy ^^
2010-11-20T22:07:07  <j3camero> Anyway yeah. Predictions market would be wild. I think this would probably attract a different crowd (maybe not). I would probably do it out of the stream of the normal ai challenges.
2010-11-20T22:07:12  <burny> the only way to make that be interesting I can think of..
2010-11-20T22:07:17  <burny> is if you pick TWO numbers..
2010-11-20T22:07:21  <Mjothvitnir> if half one = 1 and half two = 1, then you get more ones, if half of one = 0, then if "everybody picks one, you loose
2010-11-20T22:07:36  <burny> your actual number that contributes towards the average.. and your wager on what you think the average will be
2010-11-20T22:07:48  <Zannick> predictions market is a little outside the normal 1v1 game setup we have with the recent contests
2010-11-20T22:08:08  <j3camero> It came from my desire to create a "one big world" sort of game.
2010-11-20T22:08:14  <j3camero> One world, where all the players interact.
2010-11-20T22:08:25  <antimatroid1> i would love to play around with trying to approximate equlibria methods in large general games
2010-11-20T22:08:29  <Zannick> how do you rank people, then?
2010-11-20T22:08:39  <j3camero> $$
2010-11-20T22:08:51  <j3camero> It's all about the banjamins
2010-11-20T22:08:56  <burny> yay, my bot finally passed 4200rank
2010-11-20T22:09:06  <Zannick> either it becomes too volatile or earlier players are rewarded
2010-11-20T22:09:24  <Zannick> until the finals when everything is reset
2010-11-20T22:09:28  <j3camero> Yeah you would have to put everyone back at some starting number when the official contest starts.

2010-11-20T22:10:03  <antimatroid1> what about literally trying to simulate some kind of market
2010-11-20T22:10:13  <antimatroid1> and have people start in equal positions, then let the "market run"
2010-11-20T22:10:19  <j3camero> When I was at Google we had an internal prediction market. It had things like "will gmail leave beta this quarter" or "will facebook ipo this quarter" and other stuff. I totally botted it.
2010-11-20T22:10:20  <antimatroid1> and bots interact trading resources etc.
2010-11-20T22:10:21  <Mjothvitnir> if the contest ran a "week" then reseting every week during the run up would be perfect
2010-11-20T22:10:54  <j3camero> antimatroid1: what sort of resources would underly the market?
2010-11-20T22:11:02  <antimatroid1> not sure, i'd have to think about it
2010-11-20T22:11:15  <antimatroid1> ony of my economics lecturers said they tried to set a program up somewhat like that at some point
2010-11-20T22:11:37  <j3camero> antimatroid1: if we had some sort of MMO RTS game with a couple different resouces, you could see how a little market could get going on the side, and people would try to bot it.
2010-11-20T22:12:16  <antimatroid1> i'm curious as to whether algorithmic traders treat their jobs like a big ai contest
2010-11-20T22:12:23  <antimatroid1> it sounds like a lot of fun when i think about it like that
2010-11-20T22:12:33  <j3camero> Haha that is what I do for a living actually. :-)
2010-11-20T22:12:55  <antimatroid1> is it fun? or just grueling?
2010-11-20T22:13:10  <j3camero> It's like a big AI contest yeah. Except I am always aware that it's real people that we're interacting with, and there are real consequences.
2010-11-20T22:13:18  <j3camero> Oh it's terrific fun.
2010-11-20T22:13:40  <j3camero> Tons of data.
2010-11-20T22:13:58  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i'm torn between running off and doing that in a couple of years or a phd
2010-11-20T22:14:08  <j3camero> What do you do now?
2010-11-20T22:14:18  <j3camero> And in what country?
2010-11-20T22:14:35  <antimatroid1> just finished undergrad with cs, eco and maths majors, honours and then masters in maths the next two years and I live in australia

2010-11-20T22:16:58  <antimatroid1> yeah, i shall have to think about it, i have a while to decide things yet anyway
2010-11-20T22:17:06  <j3camero> Anyways my girlfriend is feeling neglected. I should probably go watch a movie with her. Catch you guys later. If anybody thinks of something that we could use to underly a wild prediction market let me know. Preferably somethign that people can tell each other lies about :-)
2010-11-20T22:17:31  <antimatroid1> hehe, i bluffed my whole game theory class on a cooperation game once, it was awesome
2010-11-20T22:17:40  <burny> why does it matter if people tell each other lies?
2010-11-20T22:17:46  <j3camero> antimatroid1: you can usually combine a PhD with working on a trading desk. The stuff I am doing is definitely novel economic research, for example.
2010-11-20T22:17:48  <Mjothvitnir> ha, my wife and I watched Tremors last night
2010-11-20T22:17:52  <burny> it's suposed to be an AI contest
2010-11-20T22:18:25  <antimatroid1> you could either put money into a private or shared fund, i convinced my whole class to put the money into the shared fund and put mine in the private (what people did was private information, but you knew aggregate results)
2010-11-20T22:18:27  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3447), Raschi(3191), bix0r4ever(3183), _Astek_(3167), _iouri_(3166), smloh1(3120), felixcoto(3110), wagstaff(3095), davidjliu(3089), dmj111(3086)
2010-11-20T22:18:39  <Mjothvitnir> and "Last Man on Earth"
2010-11-20T22:19:16  <burny> anti: I don't get it
2010-11-20T22:19:34  <burny> what money/fund?
2010-11-20T22:20:54  <antimatroid1> burny: in my game theory class, in workshops we'd play games either against other people or the whole class, one of them involved people starting with an amount of money to distribute between the public and shared funds, it worked out that on average people got more by cooperating and putting money in the shared fund, but you individually did best by putting your money into the private fund
2010-11-20T22:21:14  <antimatroid1> i convinced my workshop class to share their money as otherwise the other classes might beat us, but i also screwed my entre class over :)

2010-11-20T22:23:12  <antimatroid1> there was a running leaderboard of people through semester, bonus marks were handed out at incremental levels to people near the top
2010-11-20T22:23:43  <antimatroid1> i ended up with 10% added to my final mark, possibly because of that
2010-11-20T22:23:56  <antimatroid1> and that is to say, if i got 90% overall, my mark was then 100%
2010-11-20T22:24:03  <burny> can't go aboeve 100% anyway
