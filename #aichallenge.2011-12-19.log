2011-12-19T00:03:22  <antimatroid> it depends on when we can organise another game by
2011-12-19T00:03:31  <antimatroid> the more people who help out the faster it will be

2011-12-19T00:04:03  <Scryer> I think my first AI contest was the 1971 or 1972 Computer Chess Championship. :)
2011-12-19T00:04:31  <UncleVasya> Extrarius: In fact, starter pack that I use was made by a non-core person. He rewrote a previous starterpack.
2011-12-19T00:04:32  <antimatroid> Extrarius: pick a game (which is mostly a democratic thing where we try to work out what people are most interested in), build game specs, build the game etc.

2011-12-19T00:19:27  <rwest_> dragonfyre13: https://github.com/rossxwest/Ants-AI/blob/master/AMap.java <-- pretty much all I wrote, half my weights are 0 at the top lol
2011-12-19T00:19:30  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yeah, that's because of the added constraints on path distances
2011-12-19T00:19:36  <bmh> amstan: yes.

2011-12-19T00:20:05  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: not really, it went from being this: first send ants to food, then send ants to hills, then explore. The new version just assigned a score to all possible "targets".

2011-12-19T00:21:49  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: that's the part of my bot that I kind of liked. :) The basic idea is a w*h*w*h array, with in each cell the distance from (x,y) to (x2,y2)
2011-12-19T00:22:00  <Migi32> obviously that array is way too big to fit in memory

2011-12-19T00:22:14  <Migi32> so there are many optimizations to get an approximate solution
2011-12-19T00:22:18  <Migi32> but still O(1) lookup
2011-12-19T00:22:32  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: and you?
2011-12-19T00:22:35  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: very nice.  That's pretty slick.
2011-12-19T00:22:49  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: I went with a modified BFS, sort of...
2011-12-19T00:22:53  <hacklash> Is there a definite time that results will be released, or at least an rss feed I can follow to be  notified when they are?
2011-12-19T00:23:15  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Basically, build hills (depending on rate of change, could generate every turn, to every few, to only a handful of times per game)
2011-12-19T00:23:51  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Then, it ends up summing all hills together, building a composite, in some places taking max of either hill, in some places taking sum, and in some places taking average
2011-12-19T00:23:51  <thestinger> bmh: tuplify :)
2011-12-19T00:24:20  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: what do you mean with "hill"?
2011-12-19T00:24:25  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: depending on situations at a given location. In battle for example, the "call for help" flags which are the center of the hill are respected only outside the bounds of battle.
2011-12-19T00:24:27  <erij> I had a problem with starting with Java, developing it, then going to Scala, developing it, then going to Java again and trying a bunch of things like potential fields and influence maps, and then to C++ to try bitboards for performance reasons which turned out not being needed at all...

2011-12-19T00:25:36  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Think reverse BFS, so it counts from 0 everywhere, up a (in the end purely linear) gradient to peak. Peaks are defined as the goals, and may or may not be arbitrary. So "call for help" is at full flag value, but degrades quickly, wheras "unseen" flag is at half value but degrades very slowly.
2011-12-19T00:25:45  <a1k0n> oh oops.  i'm not running my current submission on fluxid/bhickey, haha
2011-12-19T00:26:00  <thestinger> I can actually turn off my computer tonight
2011-12-19T00:26:04  <thestinger> xD
2011-12-19T00:26:05  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Basically, linear gradients up to peaks, but in the generation it doesn't traverse water.

2011-12-19T00:26:20  <xar0l> Since we can share now ... https://github.com/jdthomas/aichallenge-ants <-- didn't get to spend as much time on it as would have liked .. but somehow was top100 for a while before the last minute re-submission :)
2011-12-19T00:26:21  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: yeah, I know what you mean. Lots of people use this kind of reverse BFS. It's also used in my pathfinding for building up that array
2011-12-19T00:26:22  <mcstar> thestinger: good call, i might win a couple of games over tcp finally
2011-12-19T00:26:35  <thestinger> yeah, I shut off my bots already

2011-12-19T00:26:47  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: also, it has "dampers" for things like my ants locations, or areas surrounding my ants (areas are their own hills, just reversed)

2011-12-19T00:27:38  <kincody> thx a1kon
2011-12-19T00:27:42  <mcstar> dunno
2011-12-19T00:27:46  <Migi32> oh, we actually reached 8000 submissions
2011-12-19T00:27:47  <Migi32> cool
2011-12-19T00:28:06  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: So it generates these "hills" to the goals, or to the flags which might be simply drawing you towards battle or away from battle to a safe place. Depending on your ant (in battle, out of battle, "bored" being at an all 0 location) they may or may not climb a parituclar hill. But in the end, it's all generated onto the same board
2011-12-19T00:28:07  <a1k0n> oh yeah i even have notes i forgot to finish
2011-12-19T00:28:31  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: The ants then do a simple "where's the next highest point" from that composite of hills, and move there.
2011-12-19T00:28:52  <rwest_> a1k0n: // does this even belong here?
2011-12-19T00:28:53  <rwest_> lol
2011-12-19T00:29:10  <hacklash> what
2011-12-19T00:29:13  <a1k0n> Score.h is a minefield
2011-12-19T00:29:17  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: but, because that wasn't intelligent enough to overcome "swirls" of high points that weren't goals, I ended up doing a multi move lookahead to find the highest point within 5 moves, and moving towards that
2011-12-19T00:29:34  <thestinger> bmh: nice, Arch has weird haskell stuff going on so there isn't a working vector package anymore...
2011-12-19T00:29:46  <thestinger> with [testing] enabled at least
2011-12-19T00:29:46  <antimatroid> a1k0n: min(9, something), those are familiar :P
2011-12-19T00:29:55  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: ah ok, was that still fast enough?
2011-12-19T00:29:56  <bmh> thestinger: derp.
2011-12-19T00:29:58  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: in the end, it worked out OK, though expensive to generate the hills. Had to go C, which was a pain to get on the server working with python (which most of it is written in)
2011-12-19T00:30:07  <bmh> thestinger: the real magic is in Searches.hs and BFS.hs
2011-12-19T00:30:16  <thestinger> bmh: I have ghc 7.2.2 atm
2011-12-19T00:30:21  <thestinger> so haskell platform doesn't work :)
2011-12-19T00:30:23  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: The C code is tuned to a T, pretty fraking fast.
2011-12-19T00:30:41  <thestinger> bmh: yeah, searches has stuff similar to what I use
2011-12-19T00:30:52  <Vaenom> mcstar: what's your bot name for the contest?
2011-12-19T00:30:55  <hacklash> what's the deal with the finals and results release? I want to get an analysis and writeup about the contest up as soon as possible after its actually over
2011-12-19T00:30:56  <erij> a1k0n: I like your movegen approach and usage of dirichlet
2011-12-19T00:31:04  <thestinger> bmh: did you get combat working?
2011-12-19T00:31:04  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: Generates about 20 odd maps on a 200 by 200 board, most complicated maze I could think of, fills the whole board, and does it within 400 ms
2011-12-19T00:31:08  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: how did you get it to work on the server actually? load it as a dynamic library at runtime?

2011-12-19T00:32:15  <kincody> thx
2011-12-19T00:32:15  <bmh> instead I started writing a roguelike in haskell
2011-12-19T00:32:20  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: thought of just building the whole thing in C, but that would be WAY to much work for very little benefit.
2011-12-19T00:32:41  <rwest_> I can't wait for the next contest
2011-12-19T00:32:48  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: I did have a slightly slower (by about a factor of 1.4) way in python, but it didn't take into account dampers properly
2011-12-19T00:32:48  <Migi32> dragonfyre13: use c++ then :p best of both!
2011-12-19T00:32:58  <rwest_> I will have more than 3 weeks to work on my bot
2011-12-19T00:33:09  <erij> dragonfyre13: yeah, I did Java, Scala, and C++...I should have stuck with Java for the simplicity...I went with C++ for my final version and it ended up being way too much work....

2011-12-19T00:35:04  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: I also get that my opinion of C++ is likely very flawed, but it's served me well recently, forcing me to choose either python (very easy to maintain) or C (very, very, very fast)

2011-12-19T00:35:11  <BenJackson> but if you grok C++ you can do some nice metaprogramming that you just can't do in C

2011-12-19T00:37:09  <dragonfyre13> kincody: I don't know about others, but my code kept track of my timings (I wrote a pure python profiler that actually runs with my code locally) and tracks how long a given action takes. As complexity increases, some things were O(1) and some things were O(n). It accomedates, and was written to scale up or down based on that.
2011-12-19T00:37:10  <Migi32> well, all I can say is that in writing my bot, I wasn't at all hindered by the fact that I used c++11. If I have a bad bot, it's because my algorithms weren't really that great
2011-12-19T00:37:13  <bmh> thestinger: want to add combat to my bot? :)

2011-12-19T00:39:16  <tmseiler> I'll see you in heck, Tim
2011-12-19T00:39:21  <dragonfyre13> Migi32: The python was a very conscious choice, would have used it even if there was no smarter bot.
2011-12-19T00:39:23  <thestinger> bmh: oh and the attack() function doesn't send ants to places where memetix style combat says they will die for sure
2011-12-19T00:39:26  <dragonfyre13> tmseiler: yes, yes you will.

2011-12-19T00:39:44  <dragonfyre13> tmseiler: I wanted to beat you in particular, but boutcher said he was doing it too.
2011-12-19T00:39:59  <mcstar> lol, perusing a1k0n's notes, im realizing my bot is infinitely less complicated

2011-12-19T00:42:31  <bmh> amstan: yeah. I use GitHub a lot, so I figured I'd shell out $20 to have a private account throughout the competition.

2011-12-19T00:42:40  <BenJackson> I *like* that I don't need a server for git otherwise
2011-12-19T00:42:41  <dragonfyre13> ChrisH_: I've never done GO before, but it looked like something I would really like.

2011-12-19T00:43:48  <bmh> thestinger: shekari (eric) was solid. He fixed my stupid mistakes.
2011-12-19T00:43:55  <rwest_> BenJackson: need private repos
2011-12-19T00:43:56  <Scryer> I've been looking at Go also, but for something that needs to be really efficient I'm not sure it would be my first choice.  Maybe it'll be more mature with the official release, though.
2011-12-19T00:43:59  <dragonfyre13> ChrisH_: that scares me a bit. There's nothing screwy like erlang types is there?
2011-12-19T00:44:13  <thestinger> bmh: your mistake was using haskell, because the ghc version on the site is so ancient
2011-12-19T00:44:18  <bmh> rwest_: I would never put private source I cared about on someone else's server
2011-12-19T00:44:20  <BenJackson> rwest_: but you can clone your own repos just fine
2011-12-19T00:44:20  <bmh> thestinger: yep.
2011-12-19T00:44:33  <BenJackson> no git repo is any "better" than any other
2011-12-19T00:44:35  <thestinger> bmh: also, pretty hard to get haskell really fast

2011-12-19T00:44:47  <ChrisH_> dragonfyre13: no, Go's interfaces are more like python classes in the sense that you get a sort of duck typing, but it is statically typed, unlike python
2011-12-19T00:44:48  <dragonfyre13> anyone know if xathis threw his code up anywhere?
2011-12-19T00:44:54  <bmh> thestinger: the bot is fast enough. We use Data.Vector with bulk updates.
2011-12-19T00:45:00  <BenJackson> were there any teams competing?  I only talked to/heard about individuals
2011-12-19T00:45:02  <dragonfyre13> ChrisH_: Kinda like cython? Or strongly typed?
2011-12-19T00:45:02  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: basically, it's C with methods for structs
2011-12-19T00:45:05  <amstan> i like looking at punchcards: https://github.com/bhickey/skynet/graphs/punch_card
2011-12-19T00:45:11  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: gotcha.
2011-12-19T00:45:15  <BenJackson> is it going to turn out that xathis isn't 19 *years old* he's *19 people*
2011-12-19T00:45:16  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: and if a struct implements the methods for an interface, it can be used for that
2011-12-19T00:45:24  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: so it's like duck-typing based on method names (like python)
2011-12-19T00:45:25  <amstan> i see you still coded on it at work
2011-12-19T00:45:36  <bmh> amstan: I did not. I don't know what those punches are. Time zones?

2011-12-19T00:45:49  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: and it also has concurrency, built-in hash tables and slices (dynamic arrays), nice strings, etc.
2011-12-19T00:45:56  <amstan> bmh: probably local, based on browser time
2011-12-19T00:45:58  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: hmmmmm
2011-12-19T00:45:59  <thestinger> it's a better C, but it's missing a lot of stuff that's in C++
2011-12-19T00:46:07  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: Darn it, another language to learn.
2011-12-19T00:46:16  <thestinger> well, it also has higher-order functions and lambdas/closures
2011-12-19T00:46:25  <ChrisH_> dragonfyre13: i don't know cython, it is strongly typed like C (even more so since integer types don't implicitly convert), a variable has one type for it's lifetime, but that type may be an interface type in which case any object that satisfies the interface by implementing all of it's methods can be assigned to the variable

2011-12-19T00:46:41  <BenJackson> McLeopold: seems to be a preponderance of thin-walled maps?
2011-12-19T00:46:47  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: My concern with it in that case is going to be library support. Python has the advent of a lot of C libraries being used, and being exposed to it. What about GO?
2011-12-19T00:46:53  <amstan> there we go people! the 50 cell maze maps
2011-12-19T00:47:02  <McLeopold> BenJackson: random is as random does
2011-12-19T00:47:25  <ChrisH_> dragonfyre13: but types don't have to declare that they implement interfaces, they just implement the methods and any interface with those methods is satisfied, even if the interface gets written after the fact

2011-12-19T00:48:03  <ChrisH_> thestinger: yes
2011-12-19T00:48:09  <BenJackson> Scala is type crazy and it still offers "duck typing"
2011-12-19T00:48:14  <ChrisH_> thestinger: but not horribly so for this project

2011-12-19T00:48:21  <BenJackson> as in you can require a class that implements some method
2011-12-19T00:48:26  <BenJackson> without naming the class
2011-12-19T00:48:31  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: scala is crazy. That is all. :D
2011-12-19T00:48:36  <bmh> Duck Typing is an awful idea.
2011-12-19T00:48:46  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: Go is really nice if you want to code a server
2011-12-19T00:48:53  <bmh> The only thing worse than duck typing is probably dynamic scope.
2011-12-19T00:48:54  <Scryer> I must be getting tired -- my eyeballs are parsing dirty words in the water patterns of the new maps. :)
2011-12-19T00:48:58  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: Scala kinda scares me a bit.
2011-12-19T00:49:08  <BenJackson> I like scala
2011-12-19T00:49:14  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: lightweight threads are awesome, and the standard lib has nice stuff for a server/client-type program
2011-12-19T00:49:14  <BenJackson> some of its collection stuff is amazingly clever
2011-12-19T00:49:19  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: Which I do sometimes for work. Sometimes. That might be an interesting use.
2011-12-19T00:49:29  <bmh> er.. maybe I'm mixing up dynamic scope with something that sounds very similar but is actually terrible.

2011-12-19T00:49:48  <thestinger> you can make 200k of them
2011-12-19T00:49:52  <thestinger> they don't have a big C stack
2011-12-19T00:49:52  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: a lot of what I do is networking and data parsing.
2011-12-19T00:49:57  <thestinger> so like
2011-12-19T00:50:05  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: hmmmmm that sounds like greenthreads.
2011-12-19T00:50:07  <thestinger> a Go http server spawns a new goroutine (lightweight thread) for each client
2011-12-19T00:50:11  <thestinger> yeah, they are green threads
2011-12-19T00:50:12  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: coroutine based?
2011-12-19T00:50:13  <thestinger> by default
2011-12-19T00:50:13  <Scryer> Be nice if those new concurrent process thingies would integrate with CUDA.
2011-12-19T00:50:22  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: you use channels (message passing)
2011-12-19T00:50:31  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: and in that case, I'm guessing they don't split across cores/CPUs.
2011-12-19T00:50:38  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: they can :)
2011-12-19T00:50:48  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: they get multiplexed over OS threads - 1 by default
2011-12-19T00:50:59  <ChrisH_> dragonfyre13: yes, coroutine inspired, but a little bit more because they can be multiplexed across multiple OS threads for parallelism as well
2011-12-19T00:51:05  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: oh good. That's part of my issue with python, for multithreading I need to basically use multiprocess
2011-12-19T00:51:11  <thestinger> channels can be unbuffered, but they can also be buffered
2011-12-19T00:51:16  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: check out stackless python
2011-12-19T00:51:32  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: already have. I prefer alternatives, but stackless is very cool in design
2011-12-19T00:51:40  <Antimony> BenJackson, that was basically my attempt to implement spawn blocking. Not sure how effective it is
2011-12-19T00:51:48  <ChrisH_> i have to say that the channels idea in Go is very pleasant to work with once you get the hang of it
2011-12-19T00:51:51  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: most of the python greenthread implimentations are built on top of stackless work.
2011-12-19T00:52:01  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: yeah, pypy supports stackless now too :)
2011-12-19T00:52:03  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: eventlet in particular is interesting

2011-12-19T00:52:29  <ChrisH_> my bot uses a goroutine for combat and another for noncombat and the main goroutine just sits and waits for orders on the channles

2011-12-19T00:56:40  <thestinger> interfaces are really slow atm
2011-12-19T00:56:48  <thestinger> and goroutines/channels still have a bit too much overhead
2011-12-19T00:56:56  <thestinger> so you're kind of locked out from using the interesting stuff
2011-12-19T00:57:00  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: darn

2011-12-19T00:57:15  <ChrisH_> i definitely had to take interfaces out of any time critical code
2011-12-19T00:57:28  <thestinger> interfaces are virtual methods
2011-12-19T00:57:39  <dragonfyre13> so, anyone else use AI "cheating" where you try to predict what moves the other guy is going to make, then counteract with yours, then counteract with theirs, etc. until you come out with an "all optimal moves" situation?

2011-12-19T00:57:40  <thestinger> so... it's slow :)
2011-12-19T00:58:18  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: that's basically what I do, the code is really messy though
2011-12-19T00:58:29  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: oh so is mine...
2011-12-19T00:58:32  <ChrisH_> dragonfyre13: I do that one level deep for combat
2011-12-19T00:58:43  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: though in the time given, I certainly couldn't have done better IMHO
2011-12-19T00:58:45  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: http://sprunge.us/YcaW I do that for myself and the enemy, to pick out offensive moves
2011-12-19T00:58:48  <ChrisH_> but there isn't enough time (with my code) to go more than that

2011-12-19T00:59:26  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: oh, yeah that's quite simplistic
2011-12-19T00:59:44  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: and then I cancel moves for myself and the "enemy" for ants that the simulation says would die

2011-12-19T01:00:06  <thestinger> and I compare that to the old scores
2011-12-19T01:00:17  <thestinger> I compare against both an offensive enemy move and a defensive one
2011-12-19T01:00:41  <thestinger> the defensive one just runs the same offense code, but it does it per ant (not coordinated)
2011-12-19T01:00:43  <dragonfyre13> I kinda assume my enemies are doing exactly that (canceling my moves that follow memetix style combat) and attempt to take that into account. Though I have to be quite careful because a lot of bots don't.

2011-12-19T01:01:20  <Antimony> Ok the writeup of my bot is up in excruciating detail. http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=2169
2011-12-19T01:01:25  <thestinger> originally I generated a bunch of enemy moves
2011-12-19T01:01:28  <thestinger> but it didn't help
2011-12-19T01:01:38  <thestinger> just coming up with an "optimal" set turned out to be better
2011-12-19T01:01:49  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: I'm doing everything per bot, but I predict both my enemies optimal moves, and mine according to combat. THEN I go into the actual combat code to get the best move in a given situation assuming that the pre-information is correct (works most of the time)

2011-12-19T01:01:58  <thestinger> I do it per-battle
2011-12-19T01:02:21  <thestinger> my battle partitioning is pretty simple :P
2011-12-19T01:02:28  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: I never did get my "backout" code working for moves though, so my ants may potentially step on each other if there's only one good move for multiple ants.
2011-12-19T01:02:43  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: and there's ants stepping there from outside combat.
2011-12-19T01:02:56  <BenJackson> all of my potential moves have a pointer into a grid of "occupied" booleans
2011-12-19T01:02:59  <thestinger> I don't have collisions, but collision detection definitely limits my combat stuff a lot, due to how I cancel moves
2011-12-19T01:03:06  <BenJackson> so I never try to make moves that are obstructed
2011-12-19T01:03:15  <thestinger> so I have to rerun my movement code post-combat to get the gap that can open up if my ants attack to be filled
2011-12-19T01:03:41  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: me too, but problem is I need to allow ants stepping on to current ant locations within combat at least, since they are bunched up.
2011-12-19T01:03:54  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/NjeP I make one of these for each ant
2011-12-19T01:04:03  <BenJackson> dragonfyre13: the poitn of the poitner is that if I choose a potential move for one ant the grid is updated
2011-12-19T01:04:04  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: I have a lot of swaps of position due to this
2011-12-19T01:04:11  <TL_> Scryer: are you still in computer chess? what's the name of your chess engine?
2011-12-19T01:04:13  <thestinger> directions that can bring them closer to targets, and ones that are just an equal distance
2011-12-19T01:04:29  <thestinger> then then I sort the directions based on tie breakers (second node distances, allies in range to get flocking, etc.)
2011-12-19T01:04:35  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: ah, gotcha. But if you pick for one ant, then the next one can pick current spot for that ant and so on
2011-12-19T01:04:44  <amstan> lol, from a bot repo: "The final changes I chose not to submit as I was unable to do much testing with the even diffusion fix. Just hoping the final tournament doesn't have a lot of non-square maps."
2011-12-19T01:04:48  <thestinger> and then I just brute-force through a list of Steps until I'm not moving crap anymore :P
2011-12-19T01:04:57  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: which means you tend to end up with a hole somewhere if you don't choose ants in the correct order.
2011-12-19T01:05:10  <BenJackson> dragonfyre13: I pick ants in a random order
2011-12-19T01:05:15  <BenJackson> sometimes the first moves get undone
2011-12-19T01:05:15  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: that was my first attempt, it didn't work well (I didn't have a lot of things covered)
2011-12-19T01:05:31  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: it's that "undone" code that I didn't ever finish
2011-12-19T01:05:40  <BenJackson> my code uses simulated annealing
2011-12-19T01:05:43  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: I decided that at some point, it's acceptable losses
2011-12-19T01:05:45  <BenJackson> "undo" is the next thing after "do"

2011-12-19T01:06:19  <BenJackson> it makes moves by picking a random move and scoring the entire result.  if it's good enough (read about SA to see what that means) we keep it, else undo
2011-12-19T01:06:25  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: retreat from battle, or undo a move if it ends up someone down the line gets squished?
2011-12-19T01:06:26  <thestinger> my ants kind of just start moving away from the enemy and some stragglers get left behind to die...
2011-12-19T01:06:34  <thestinger> dragonfyre13: retreat from battle as a group
2011-12-19T01:06:39  <thestinger> it's not coordinated, I was too lazy to code it
2011-12-19T01:06:40  <Scryer> TL - I don't do computer chess any longer. My program was TECH - it was the predecessor to the other C-MU programs, including Deep Thought (later Deep Blue).
2011-12-19T01:06:51  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: ah, yeah mine leave thier friends behind as they start to get overwhelmed.
2011-12-19T01:07:07  <thestinger> I retreat individual ants
2011-12-19T01:07:37  <kincody_> reinforment is a better idea than retreate
2011-12-19T01:07:41  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: but I actually started working that into the strategy, leaving the best positioned ones there to ensure the enemy has to think before moving, or to move around those guys (leave the ones that give mutual death, move out the ones that assure my death)

2011-12-19T01:09:01  <Scryer> Advance toward the rear!
2011-12-19T01:09:28  <dragonfyre13> thestinger: my retreat from battle code is somewhat flawed still though, in that if the enemy does move forward most of my guys move into a position to ensure greatest enemy losses, since they generally would retreat towards something they don't want to, or there's not a good target other than behind the enemy.
2011-12-19T01:09:52  <BenJackson> my bots don't really retreat, they just move back in unison twoard the supporting ants that better be coming from behind

2011-12-19T01:11:24  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: i have a small factor in my combat logic that breaks ties between otherwise equal moves to maximize available moves on the next turn

2011-12-19T01:11:55  <BenJackson> my combat has a bunch of small "tiebreaks" but not that one
2011-12-19T01:12:04  <amstan> Kommander: i think you'll have lots of competition in here for that

2011-12-19T01:13:05  <BenJackson> the one that turned out to be key was to like to step into the "combat+1" radius squares that are between my ants and my hills
2011-12-19T01:13:11  <BenJackson> that's how I finally got them to quit sliding by

2011-12-19T01:14:37  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I just have a term that reduces a combat position's value if the enemy is closer to one of my hills than the other positions.
2011-12-19T01:14:44  <BenJackson> then label the combat+2 neighborhoods of participating enemies and my ants
2011-12-19T01:14:46  <thestinger> I paint on attackradius for each place an enemy ant could move

2011-12-19T01:15:20  <BenJackson> after that you just iterate through the groups and look at the labels to know which ants are in each group
2011-12-19T01:15:20  <thestinger> so that stops it from spreading over water
2011-12-19T01:15:24  <McLeopold> did anyone value ants by distance from hill?
2011-12-19T01:15:30  <BenJackson> oh, *my* ants are agumented by neighbors

2011-12-19T01:16:26  <thestinger> well, razing an enemy hill or getting close to it counts as score for combat resolution
2011-12-19T01:16:27  <dragonfyre13> McLeopold: I valued ants in a few classes. Close to known enemy hill, close to my hill with an enemy nearby (engaged in battle) and "other"
2011-12-19T01:16:31  <Scryer> kincody: food flooding for me took about 0.4 ms in C.  Is LISP really 200 times slower?  Ouch!
2011-12-19T01:16:33  <BenJackson> I don't precompute too much
2011-12-19T01:16:43  <BenJackson> I Have a "neighborhood" function that does euclidean radii
2011-12-19T01:16:52  <BenJackson> then a "dialate" that increases that by 1 move
2011-12-19T01:17:01  <BenJackson> so combat is euclidean(r) dialated twice

2011-12-19T01:17:51  <thestinger> ChrisH_: I think he means adjusting how you do combat based on distance from your hill
2011-12-19T01:17:55  <BenJackson> dragonfyre13: well, technically combat doesn't care about water
2011-12-19T01:18:07  <thestinger> ChrisH_: like allowing desperate sacrifices right next to the hill
2011-12-19T01:18:11  <BenJackson> practically speaking I do have bugs with thinking I can fight ants with 2 water between them
2011-12-19T01:18:17  <BenJackson> doesn't come up too much
2011-12-19T01:18:26  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: I figure that the time to replace an ant is the same as the distance from the nearest hill
2011-12-19T01:18:33  <BenJackson> it only really blew up when I tried to use the frontier of enemy attack radii to project a threat map
2011-12-19T01:18:37  <BenJackson> and that crossed water
2011-12-19T01:18:45  <antimatroid> i only just added in "food collection" to my combat evaluation this morning
2011-12-19T01:18:46  <McLeopold> so, if you take the time to make it to an enemy hill, you'd rather not lose that ant
2011-12-19T01:18:56  <Scryer> kincody: My testes would be pretty tired if I ran them over a 255x255 map also, I guess.  Do you stop the BFS after touching your first ant, or do you fill the entire map each time?
2011-12-19T01:18:59  <kincody_> dman
2011-12-19T01:19:05  <antimatroid> but it doesn't try to move near food next turn, still tie breaks eventually off closest friend hill
2011-12-19T01:19:07  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: oh, but that's not really true because you probably already have ants on the way, so in assembly line fashion the cost to replace is just the distance to the next closest ant
2011-12-19T01:19:14  <thestinger> Scryer: I do tons of flood fills for the entire map
2011-12-19T01:19:15  <BenJackson> McLeopold: I found it was tricky to get that right
2011-12-19T01:19:28  <BenJackson> you could think of it in terms of reducing YOUR ant values or increasing TARGET ant values
2011-12-19T01:19:35  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: Never could figure out a good way of going "hey I'm this far from here, assuming I don't cross water" without doing an A* search (or derivitive) and since my code already kinda does BFS....
2011-12-19T01:19:36  <BenJackson> or unwillingness to retreat
2011-12-19T01:19:38  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: i have a problem for you ....
2011-12-19T01:19:39  <thestinger> Scryer: most just mark distances to a tile from every tile, but some also propagate the location that is closest
2011-12-19T01:19:49  <BenJackson> dragonfyre13: combat works across (thin) water though
2011-12-19T01:20:03  <BenJackson> assumptions about how many steps you can take are wrong though
2011-12-19T01:20:03  <kincody_> i ddo have a radius cut off code but never got it uploded though
2011-12-19T01:20:05  <_flag> Sorry, if this has been mentioned and I'm just not paying attention to irc, but is the final round going to start soon? I'm debating going to bed or watching my first game or two
2011-12-19T01:20:09  <thestinger> so my foraging code assigns ants to the nearest location and then marks off everything in viewradius/2 as taken
2011-12-19T01:20:12  <Scryer> thestinger - I reran my food floods if there was interference among foods. Typically it didn't take more than 3 or 4 floods to assign each food to an ant.
2011-12-19T01:20:16  <BenJackson> _flag: they got the maps up
2011-12-19T01:20:26  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: I kept running into that. My ants would try to defend against ants that were across a 1 wide strip of water. And pile up on my hill. And not let anyone out
2011-12-19T01:20:33  <thestinger> Scryer: it's so fast for 1 target that I do a flood fill per food :)
2011-12-19T01:20:44  <BenJackson> the important part of my food gathering is first putting all food (and I include food I remember having seen) into a priority queue by score
2011-12-19T01:20:50  <ChrisH_> here is an interesting tidbit about my combat, I value my first three ants in any combat at 2x enemy ants, and after the first three my ants are equal value to enemies
2011-12-19T01:20:51  <thestinger> Scryer: a multi-source one with 10k targets at different weights takes less than 1ms
2011-12-19T01:20:52  <BenJackson> then I bfs from each food in its score order
2011-12-19T01:20:56  <BenJackson> and assign ants
2011-12-19T01:21:00  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: But it generally worked out, because another of my ants walked up and killed them, then I got this massive flood that dominated anyone coming towards me streaming out of my hill.
2011-12-19T01:21:01  <_flag> BenJackson: Can I see them somewhere?
2011-12-19T01:21:18  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: waiting for your problem
2011-12-19T01:21:22  <BenJackson> _flag: you ahve sb?  amstan just linked
2011-12-19T01:21:28  <Scryer> thestinger - yes, that fits with what I was seeing.  I seldom spent more than 10ms total on my moves. Given more programming time I would have used up more on combat.

2011-12-19T01:22:30  <antimatroid> the bottom right 'a' should go south and around (not east!), the "trapped" a should push another 'a' out of line to walk around, and the a above the gap should go south
2011-12-19T01:22:36  <dragonfyre13> ChrisH_: Though I can generally work out a way not to trade, or keep "advancing to the rear" into a wall and die if their's to many enemies

2011-12-19T01:23:31  <BenJackson> so my movement assignment takes into account what every ant will gain/lose in vision
2011-12-19T01:23:35  <antimatroid> my compromise was to move a trapped 'a' inside its trapped region until it couldn't go closer to the target, randomly search to get trapped ones out and to just make the bottom right a wait

2011-12-19T01:23:56  <thestinger> kincody_: to look for enemy hills I just flood fill from unseen locations and send ants to the nearest ones (only spare ants are used for that)
2011-12-19T01:23:58  <_flag> BenJackson: I'm going to be working on a writeup that you may want to read, but basically I just push outwards by practical distance from all my hills, and leave just enough ants behind to be in vision of all the area
2011-12-19T01:24:20  *** bearoff <bearoff!~bear@95.69.156.5> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-19T01:24:30  <kincody_> what my ants do is it chooses random points on the map... the vieve radius of the points never overlap
2011-12-19T01:24:45  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I track the last turn I saw every tile on the map, then I look for circles the size of viewRad that have the most stale information and put an exploration point in the middle. mark that circle as done and repeat until the map is covered
2011-12-19T01:24:55  <kincody_> send any non busy ants to the random points..
2011-12-19T01:24:57  <Scryer> My last version did that, BJ, but I didn't get to the point where the outer ones keep moving out leaving the inner ones to take their place with the vision thing.
2011-12-19T01:25:04  <antimatroid> _flag: how do you deal with using too many ants for defense when ant hills start close?
2011-12-19T01:25:07  <kincody_> tsp seems useless with so lil time
2011-12-19T01:25:17  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: I just run headlong for the closest unseen position that I haven't seen in a while. That naturally leaves ants behind because they keep going back to check previous positions (but generally there aren't any, since the ants coming from the hill see that first
2011-12-19T01:25:25  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: aha, interesting.  I tried various methods of assigning points to explore but I never liked any of them
2011-12-19T01:25:30  <antimatroid> i had that issue, so now I move an ant towards it's closest hill if it has to to meet an enemy, otherwise i later push enemies away from hills
2011-12-19T01:25:45  <amstan> so.. let's say there was an infinite map size, all land
2011-12-19T01:25:50  <amstan> and you had a hill and one ant
2011-12-19T01:25:56  <_flag> antimatroid: I'm not sure what you mean. Why would I not want to defend my hill. Do you mean in multi hill maps?
2011-12-19T01:25:56  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I didn't think of your way of assigning a point though
2011-12-19T01:26:02  <amstan> food was spawning at a defined rate per area
2011-12-19T01:26:07  <Antimony> my bot doesn't have exploration code
2011-12-19T01:26:12  <amstan> how fast would the ant count grow
2011-12-19T01:26:15  <amstan> exponentially?
2011-12-19T01:26:17  <antimatroid> _flag: there's making sure the ant can't get to your hill, then there's actively pushing the ant away
2011-12-19T01:26:35  <dragonfyre13> Antimony: you just sit at your base waiting for someone to come kill you?
2011-12-19T01:26:37  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: I don't think I understand the question you posed to me.
2011-12-19T01:26:37  <antimatroid> if you let it go past near the start to closer friends, you can kill it off with them and expand out to collect food in the open spaces
2011-12-19T01:26:38  <BenJackson> amstan: I think only quadratically
2011-12-19T01:26:41  <dragonfyre13> Antimony: :D
2011-12-19T01:26:45  <antimatroid> i'm basically banking on that being useful to me
2011-12-19T01:26:46  <BenJackson> amstan: imagine the linear case
2011-12-19T01:26:46  <Antimony> I explore by accident
2011-12-19T01:26:53  <BenJackson> just start with a strip of land entirely filled with food
2011-12-19T01:26:55  <antimatroid> cause i now push enemies away like after collecting food etc.
2011-12-19T01:26:57  <BenJackson> ant can only move so fast
2011-12-19T01:27:06  <dragonfyre13> Antimony: Ah, gotcha. You push towards some other objective?
2011-12-19T01:27:12  <amstan> BenJackson: yes, but he gets more ants  to help
2011-12-19T01:27:13  <Antimony> food and hills
2011-12-19T01:27:15  <BenJackson> so it moves left, gets food, new ant, repeat, growth is n in n turns
2011-12-19T01:27:19  <kincody_> my chekpoints on the map are constant thoughtout the game
2011-12-19T01:27:44  <thestinger> Antimony: so your food gatherers expand your viewradius outwards basically?
2011-12-19T01:27:54  <thestinger> and then you have more area to cover
2011-12-19T01:27:59  <_flag> antimatriod: I have priorities. Exploring unknown area is often ranked higher than going towards enemies, but when my area is under control, then my ants go towards the unknown area beyond the enemies, and by virtue of my battle resolution, push the enemies back
2011-12-19T01:28:04  <BenJackson> amstan: oh duh I'm wrong: even in the 2d case the answer is *linear*
2011-12-19T01:28:05  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: an ant in line should step out of line for the trapped ant to get out, the bottom right a is going to be stuck being stationary for ages if he waits in line, he would be better off taking a step south and moving along
2011-12-19T01:28:12  <BenJackson> amstan: only one ant spawn per turn!
2011-12-19T01:28:15  <_flag> I'm not sure if that answers your question or not, it's tough to explain in an irc comment
2011-12-19T01:28:17  <dragonfyre13> I had plenty of cycles left, given more time my next thing (after I got the stuff I was working on right, which it wasn't) would have been symmetry calculation to determine new goals.
2011-12-19T01:28:17  <Antimony> has anyone taken a look at the writeup of my bot?
2011-12-19T01:28:18  <antimatroid> i wanted to do all this when doing a single bfs from targets to sources

2011-12-19T01:28:56  <kincody_> i dont belive a single bfs can solve it
2011-12-19T01:29:04  <BenJackson> I kind of want to write a new bot now that has no time limit but figure out *everything* you can infer from the state you can see
2011-12-19T01:29:04  <amstan> BenJackson: what if you could spawn more?
2011-12-19T01:29:10  <BenJackson> symmetry detection, backtracking ants to hills, etc
2011-12-19T01:29:15  <dragonfyre13> kincody_: it kinda can, but trust me it's not a great solution.

2011-12-19T01:29:41  <_flag> Why are there so many two player maps and so few maps with many players?

2011-12-19T01:29:51  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: I have a very small amount of backtracking stuff in there, but my ants mostly ignore it since they don't take it into account during combat
2011-12-19T01:29:52  <_flag> Does that mean the finals will have a focus on two player games?
2011-12-19T01:29:53  <BenJackson> amstan: with enough food you'd just have a conga line of ants covering every land
2011-12-19T01:30:08  <amstan> BenJackson: let's say the terrain is not a grid, but floating point, and you can find at many ants as you want in one area
2011-12-19T01:30:15  <amstan> and the one hill can spawn as many ants as it wants
2011-12-19T01:30:51  <dragonfyre13> BenJackson: it pretty much just assumes if an ant is moving away from an area, that's likely towards their base. Once I kill them I head that way (mildly more likely) by simply increasing the unseen flag in that area. But it doesn't work very well
2011-12-19T01:31:25  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: in my case all the ants in line increase the cost of traversing their tile so that other ants will try to avoid those spaces, but I haven't tested a scenario like that and my bot doesn't tend to form lines of movement that dense, so I haven't had to think about it too hard
2011-12-19T01:31:38  <dragonfyre13> ok, I should go to bed. I have work in the morning, and I'm exhausted.
2011-12-19T01:31:46  <dragonfyre13> and my eyes are swimming
2011-12-19T01:31:49  <BenJackson> amstan: well the area covered by ants radiating from the hill grows quadratically, to food consumption grows quadratically
2011-12-19T01:31:52  <_flag> McLeopold: Why are there more two and three player maps than say, eight, nine and ten player maps? Take the random walk maps for instance.
2011-12-19T01:31:54  <dragonfyre13> night all.
2011-12-19T01:31:57  <BenJackson> so I'd say integral of quadratic or cubic
2011-12-19T01:32:12  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: actually my bot only increases the cost for ant tiles if the ants are in combat, so I'm not sure what my bot would do in that case exactly
2011-12-19T01:32:21  <Vaenom> has anyone tried to encode data with their ants?
2011-12-19T01:32:24  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: if your hive is large enough and it's the only shortest path to anything else on the grid, not much else can happen
2011-12-19T01:32:31  <McLeopold> _flag: it's all random

2011-12-19T01:33:13  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: older versions of my bot would have issues like that on maze maps because my bot used to send lots of ants to the same goal, but it doesn't do that any more so my ants tend to spread out enough to avoid that case.
2011-12-19T01:33:13  <_flag> McLeopold: Perhaps two and three player maps are more likely to be valid?
2011-12-19T01:33:30  <McLeopold> _flag: perhaps
2011-12-19T01:33:51  <Scryer> amstan: do you assume that every ant can find food everywhere on your floating point terrain? If so, then there are 2 ants at the beginning of move 2, 4 at the beginning of move 3, and 2^(k-1) at the beginning of move k.
2011-12-19T01:34:13  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: you could be right, good think most maps don't look like that.  ;)
2011-12-19T01:35:06  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: in the drawing you pasted, I would only send 3 ants over to the food, the rest of them would be moving out the big opening at the bottom to explore
2011-12-19T01:35:20  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: i get that, the food is just to indicate targets
2011-12-19T01:35:24  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: actually only one ant would go to the food because they are close enough together
2011-12-19T01:35:32  <amstan> Scryer: yes
2011-12-19T01:35:36  <antimatroid> the idea is that you want to move all ants in that direction, what's the optimal way to do it
2011-12-19T01:35:46  <amstan> Scryer: well.. wait
2011-12-19T01:35:56  <amstan> Scryer: no.. they only find food where it has spawned
2011-12-19T01:35:58  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: good question, I haven't solved it
2011-12-19T01:36:06  <amstan> it spawns at a constant rate/area
2011-12-19T01:36:26  <Scryer> Welp - then the 2^(k-1) is the limit depending on the food spawn rate, right?
2011-12-19T01:36:47  <BenJackson> Scryer: I was assuming constant rate per area
2011-12-19T01:36:53  <BenJackson> so all that matters is the area covered by ants
2011-12-19T01:37:04  <BenJackson> so if they radiate outward uniformly in a circle their area is pi*r^2
2011-12-19T01:37:30  <BenJackson> thus at each time t they consume all food in that area, k*pi*r^2
2011-12-19T01:37:52  <BenJackson> so number of ants is sum over t of k*Pi*r^2
2011-12-19T01:38:02  <BenJackson> dt
2011-12-19T01:38:29  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: but moves can't go diagonal, so they radiate outward in a 45deg rotated square
2011-12-19T01:38:42  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: amstan amended to floating point ants and infinite hive spawn
2011-12-19T01:38:47  <ChrisH_> oh
2011-12-19T01:38:49  <BenJackson> otherwise the answer is linear because hills are liniear

2011-12-19T01:40:14  <Scryer> Vaenom - I proposed on the forum doing an ant dance to convey handshaking data to another (potential ally) ant you just meant.
2011-12-19T01:40:17  <Scryer> *met.

2011-12-19T01:40:34  <ChrisH_> it seems like it might not be exactly quadratic though because the frontier circle has only one ant to cover a larger and larger radius

2011-12-19T01:40:59  <BenJackson> amstan: I was wondering if anyone thought about the influence of game order on it
2011-12-19T01:41:06  <a1k0n> all i did was remove an utterly crazy block of code from my scoring function
2011-12-19T01:41:21  <BenJackson> especially in the finals where everyone is reset I'm sure you'd get different results if you took all game results and re-applied them in other orders
2011-12-19T01:41:30  <BenJackson> like worst case all your losses followed by all your wins
2011-12-19T01:41:31  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i'm kirby on bhickey
2011-12-19T01:41:40  <Vaenom> Scryer: I thought of that, then I've read somewhere that it was against the rule. lol
2011-12-19T01:41:45  <amstan> BenJackson: we'll have a cutoff later for the top ranking people
2011-12-19T01:41:51  <amstan> BenJackson: so they'll have more games than the lower end
2011-12-19T01:41:59  <amstan> if that's what you're asking

2011-12-19T01:42:16  <BenJackson> amstan: I mean right now you play a game, invoke trueskill, repeat
2011-12-19T01:42:29  <Scryer> Vaenom - it's against the rules to intentionally lose a game, but I don't recall anything about intentionally ganging up on the other players with a confederate.
2011-12-19T01:42:31  <BenJackson> but if you just took all the game results again in another order and invoked trueskill serially on all of those
2011-12-19T01:42:34  <BenJackson> you'd get different results
2011-12-19T01:42:38  <BenJackson> but I'm not sure how different
2011-12-19T01:43:02  <amstan> BenJackson: yeah, something like that
2011-12-19T01:43:11  <amstan> BenJackson: the api php thing does it i think
2011-12-19T01:43:33  <kincody_> a1kon: i rember one of your bots used to time out after it explored a certain number of  tiles ?  how did you solve that?
2011-12-19T01:43:36  <antimatroid> BenJackson: i think janzert was hoping to just match the first few rounds randomly, not sure if he had the time to do that
2011-12-19T01:43:37  <ChrisH_> it's like if you take a number and add 10% then subtrace 10% of that you get a different result than subracting 10% and then adding 10% of the new number
2011-12-19T01:44:09  <a1k0n> kincody_: did it?  all of my timeouts were debug-output-related
2011-12-19T01:44:12  <ChrisH_> or not
2011-12-19T01:44:23  <antimatroid> this is a problem you can't avoid though right?
2011-12-19T01:44:24  <a1k0n> kincody_: i solved it by #undeffing my debug fprintf(stderr, ...)
2011-12-19T01:44:48  <antimatroid> even if trueskill was order independent, the match making algorithm will skew it in favour of bots who win early
2011-12-19T01:44:50  <a1k0n> (notice all the #ifdef VERBOSE0 and BLAH and whatever)
2011-12-19T01:44:51  <kincody_> oh so it was not a bfs timeout...
2011-12-19T01:44:51  <antimatroid> but what else can we do?
2011-12-19T01:45:04  <a1k0n> heh, no.  bfs takes a couple hundred microseconds.

2011-12-19T01:45:29  <Vaenom> Scryer: nice.  low ranker have very little odd of meeting in a game, but top 10 does and what a shocker it would be to see a Top 5 gang with a Top 7 to gain the Top 3   :P
2011-12-19T01:45:39  <a1k0n> i do bfs up front for various things, and then i do incremental bfs replanning for each ant's possible move, then i start sampling
2011-12-19T01:45:53  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: the only solution is to always rerank based on entire game history, but that is unpractical
2011-12-19T01:45:56  <kincody_> damn i should have got myself a better bfs..
2011-12-19T01:46:01  <ChrisH_> with this many entries
2011-12-19T01:46:08  <ChrisH_> and the number of games to be played
2011-12-19T01:46:14  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: but what about match making?
2011-12-19T01:46:33  <antimatroid> you're still going to on average play better bots if you won games earlier rather than later right?
2011-12-19T01:46:33  <a1k0n> mine isn't even as good as BenJackson's explanation on the forums
2011-12-19T01:46:39  <a1k0n> i have an unnecessary extra vector copy

2011-12-19T01:48:22  <ChrisH_> first game running: woot!
2011-12-19T01:48:26  <antimatroid> say you have bots A and B of equal strength, A wins the first game and B loses, so A is more likely to play better bots than B in the second game right? doesn't B have a harder path to their correct ranking due to having to play possibly worse bots?

2011-12-19T01:48:59  <BenJackson> antimatroid: the wy I was thinking about it:  bot loses game 2 to xathis, that counts for something.  20 games lather xathis is #1 and that barely counts for anything
2011-12-19T01:49:05  <amstan> first game done!

2011-12-19T01:51:18  <a1k0n> trueskill works on each individual game ranking
2011-12-19T01:51:21  <BenJackson> he only let 13 ants out and stored 247

2011-12-19T02:03:39  <Scryer> Nice win, Zaphus - I think you may be the first real bot to play. :)
2011-12-19T02:03:45  <Zaphus> amstan: my bot didnt get credited with it's win:  http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2253   should be on 28.08 skillz but it's not there
2011-12-19T02:03:47  <amstan> thestinger: and i'm not just talking about bots that might be in between the rankings in tcp
2011-12-19T02:04:02  <BenJackson> Zaphus: I already registered that complaint for you but janzert says it's ok
2011-12-19T02:04:05  <amstan> thestinger: i'm talking about the score you get when you have to play against other bots, that might affect your ranking too

2011-12-19T02:06:17  <a1k0n> isn't your bot ranked higher than 95 anyway?
2011-12-19T02:06:19  <antimatroid> i saw solifigud there before
2011-12-19T02:06:33  <BenJackson> What IS the secondary key for the rankings?
2011-12-19T02:06:37  <BenJackson> not name or UID
2011-12-19T02:06:42  <ChrisH_> a1k0n: i'm just goofing off.
2011-12-19T02:07:32  <ChrisH_> I hope I end up higher than 95.
2011-12-19T02:08:08  <Antimony> aww man, no longer in the top 100 :(
2011-12-19T02:08:10  <BenJackson> I hope I end up higher than 9.5
2011-12-19T02:08:26  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: it could be uid because RVeerdonk was just above me and he's uid 5 i think, I'm uid 10
2011-12-19T02:08:29  <Zaphus> I hope I end up higher than 9^5
2011-12-19T02:08:40  * BenJackson snorts coke out his nose
2011-12-19T02:08:55  <RedTurtle> I wonder how much the finals will change the rankings
2011-12-19T02:09:11  <BenJackson> RedTurtle: none of the top players were "settled" in the final days
2011-12-19T02:09:19  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yep, uid is the secondary sort key, hover over the rankings in order and the uid in the URL goes up
2011-12-19T02:09:38  <BenJackson> all I can do to guess my rank is count players I *know* can beat me and then those that maybe can
2011-12-19T02:10:29  <RedTurtle> I have a general question for those of you who wrote your bots in C
2011-12-19T02:10:30  <ChrisH_> So where do you think that puts you BenJackson
2011-12-19T02:10:41  <xar0l> Antimony: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=2169 <--- impressive, you actually got symmetry detection working!
2011-12-19T02:10:55  <RedTurtle> 500ms seems like an eternity in C, do you actually use all that time?
2011-12-19T02:11:20  <thestinger> enumerating moves for combat takes a long time
2011-12-19T02:11:29  <thestinger> I could have used all the time up on that
2011-12-19T02:11:30  <Scryer> RedTurtle - nope. About 10ms average. Highest I saw was about 40 ms.  I have crappy combat, though.
2011-12-19T02:11:42  <thestinger> my pre-combat takes 4ms to 20ms
2011-12-19T02:12:04  <ChrisH_> thestinger: resolving the results of all the combat possitions and scoring them is what my bot spends most of it's time on, enumerating the possible moves is trivial by comparison
2011-12-19T02:12:07  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: last time I counted it off I got about 5 people I know I won't beat and a handful of maybes so I think top 10 is possible, probably 7+ or 8+
2011-12-19T02:12:28  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: Am I above you or below you?
2011-12-19T02:12:29  <thestinger> ChrisH_: yeah, I meant going through a bunch of moves and evaluating a score
2011-12-19T02:12:36  <bearoff> tell me please, I see the rank changing in profile, but games shown are past. How to see last my bot's games?
2011-12-19T02:12:36  <ChrisH_> thestinger: oh
2011-12-19T02:12:37  <BenJackson> 99.9% <25, 99% < 20, 90% < 15, say about 60% < 10
2011-12-19T02:13:03  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: xathis, pguillory, you, flag are ones I remember off the top of my head that are definitely above
2011-12-19T02:13:15  <Zaphus> They should have triggered a resubmit for all bots, so the version number increased and it was easier to spot when the finals started.
2011-12-19T02:13:18  <BenJackson> xathis #1 for sure, then I think 2-5 or 6 are pretty tight
2011-12-19T02:13:27  <BenJackson> but then there's a gap before another close stretch out to about 15 or 20
2011-12-19T02:13:29  <ChrisH_> I would put memetix and greentea above me lately as well
2011-12-19T02:13:30  <BenJackson> I think I'm in the gap
2011-12-19T02:13:36  <kincody> y are there only 3 servers up?
2011-12-19T02:13:36  <BenJackson> oh I forgot lazarant
2011-12-19T02:13:42  <BenJackson> and memetix
2011-12-19T02:13:59  <BenJackson> lazarant is good at beating me 1v1.  whatever he does my bot does not keep him out of my territory
2011-12-19T02:14:01  <Scryer> Memetix' last version looked very strong.
2011-12-19T02:14:06  <BenJackson> I don't know if that will translate into beating me overall
2011-12-19T02:14:07  <ChrisH_> lazarant beats me in many games, but I think I do better against the other bots than it does so I rank higher
2011-12-19T02:14:08  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-12-19T02:14:55  <ChrisH_> delineate is strong too
2011-12-19T02:14:56  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I may end up disappointed if I've lost track of too many top 10 players in my head :)

2011-12-19T02:21:27  <a1k0n> Vaenom: he waited until the last minute to submit to the contest site.  he's been very stealthy.
2011-12-19T02:21:31  <thestinger> but there were a lot of reuploads going on, so it's hard to know how packed it is at the top

2011-12-19T02:23:00  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: there will be a little shuffling due to the sigmas being more equal, but the mu scores weren't that out of line for most top bots near the end.
2011-12-19T02:23:01  <a1k0n> i suspect janzert just ran that one game through trueskill again as zaphus and fofand have 2 games now
2011-12-19T02:23:01  <antimatroid> i think we killed bhicket.net again
2011-12-19T02:23:08  <Zaphus> a1k0n: just realised what you were saying, the rankings do indeed claim I've played two games when it's 1... better than 0 games when it was 1

2011-12-19T02:23:36  <antimatroid> a1k0n: probably not as important anymore
2011-12-19T02:23:39  <antimatroid> bots are in
2011-12-19T02:23:55  <Vaenom> I did too. I didn't want others to know there was a trick to have the ants to reproduce.   O 10 10 10.5 10.5     O 11 11 10.5 10.5
2011-12-19T02:24:09  <ChrisH_> Minthos: I think all the early matches are random, so the scheduler isn't really turned on yet, thus the 0 players ahead.
2011-12-19T02:24:23  <Zaphus> Minthos: Games paused while Janzert checks a bug
2011-12-19T02:24:40  <antimatroid> Vaenom: what?

2011-12-19T02:25:18  <antimatroid> just before i think it dropped down to 6
2011-12-19T02:25:22  <thestinger> Vaenom: he barely played any games, so his sigma didn't drop much
2011-12-19T02:25:26  <antimatroid> but it didn't have much competition
2011-12-19T02:25:48  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: a1k0n: I guess I noticed Hammerok in particular was 10th or 11th and didn't seem that strong
2011-12-19T02:26:01  <kincody_> porbably the queue is implemented as a priority q... based on the last played game..thats probably the reason for o in queue
2011-12-19T02:26:10  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: i agree, but he was strong enough for top 25 probably
2011-12-19T02:26:15  <BenJackson> 23:23 < antimatroid> i think we killed bhicket.net again

2011-12-19T02:29:12  <BenJackson> divided by players per game
2011-12-19T02:29:16  <BenJackson> so more like 3-4 hours
2011-12-19T02:29:23  <ChrisH_> yeah, that sounds about right
2011-12-19T02:29:31  <ChrisH_> assuming server capacity is similar to before

2011-12-19T02:30:17  <a1k0n> and i am illegitimately in 2nd place on it
2011-12-19T02:30:20  <Minthos> that's still just one game per bot, meaning any good bot will beat the crap out of a bunch of crap bots and stats will be meaningless for at least half a day or so
2011-12-19T02:30:29  <ChrisH_> was just looking at my old games and was reminded of itzkow being a pretty good bot
2011-12-19T02:30:44  <a1k0n> yeah, itzkow is good
2011-12-19T02:30:57  <ChrisH_> and fourmidable

2011-12-19T02:31:25  <a1k0n> memetix, fourmidable, lazarant, and me were roughly neck-and-neck for a while
2011-12-19T02:31:25  <Vaenom> you run everyone's first game in a "special" map where there's only  1 ant and his hill,  12 food and a very little water in a 30 x 30 map.

2011-12-19T02:35:17  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I think that's a harder problem than playing ants itself
2011-12-19T02:35:24  <thestinger> antimatroid: piratepad?
2011-12-19T02:35:30  <ChrisH_> etherpad
2011-12-19T02:35:35  <amstan> BenJackson: ?
2011-12-19T02:35:36  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: heck I thought it would be hard to deliberately write a bot to hit any spot, not just a high spot

2011-12-19T02:35:48  <BenJackson> like when I ranked up past 500 bots a while ago
2011-12-19T02:35:51  <delineate> was the distribution of the map types for the finals the same as what was running before?
2011-12-19T02:35:58  <BenJackson> I couldn't figure out exactly what I'd do to make sure I broke even against them
2011-12-19T02:36:06  <BenJackson> amstan: just like extending the contest
2011-12-19T02:36:14  <BenJackson> amstan: now we need more room in the top 10 for all the "top 10" players
2011-12-19T02:36:28  <BenJackson> amstan: you're not used to unreasonable requests??

2011-12-19T02:44:15  <BenJackson> a1k0n: 4th
2011-12-19T02:44:19  <BenJackson> I played him in my last game
2011-12-19T02:44:22  <a1k0n> word

2011-12-19T02:44:30  <BenJackson> also I won that game :)
2011-12-19T02:44:37  <BenJackson> so pencil me in for 3rd
2011-12-19T02:44:49  <BenJackson> that's all minus xathis
2011-12-19T02:44:59  <a1k0n> teapotahedron was 9th last i played him
2011-12-19T02:45:29  <a1k0n> okay so now we've got a pretty good handicap, let's open betting
2011-12-19T02:45:38  <BenJackson> so we don't actually have too much of an excess in the top 10
2011-12-19T02:45:39  <delineate> a1k0n: I think I was somewhere between 5th-8th, although looking at those mus, teapotahedron and FlagCapper will also be above me, so I'll probably be lower
2011-12-19T02:46:12  <a1k0n> oh yeah he had a pretty high sigma
2011-12-19T02:46:19  <a1k0n> hmm, hard to call!
2011-12-19T02:46:31  <BenJackson> a1k0n: what's the format?
2011-12-19T02:46:36  <BenJackson> no one is going to bet against xathis in 1
2011-12-19T02:46:43  <a1k0n> heh, i dunno i was just kidding
2011-12-19T02:47:02  <antimatroid> BenJackson: what about novelty bets?
2011-12-19T02:47:04  <moduspwned> maybe he didnt get to test v3 much and xathisv3 will just crash

2011-12-19T02:50:00  <antimatroid> if you search for green trea, xathis probably beat him in just over half

2011-12-19T02:50:11  <_flag> He's actually more vulnerable in 1v1 than in larger games
2011-12-19T02:50:17  <_flag> For some odd reason

2011-12-19T02:53:12  <moduspwned> multi-hill mazes are hard. wtf do you do?

2011-12-19T02:54:33  <ChrisH_> and what's been interesting is that I used to do poorly on many player random walk maps, but my recent versions have done much better on them, which is very encouraging

2011-12-19T02:57:23  <ChrisH_> the ninja moves work best on the more open areas around hills on most random walks
2011-12-19T02:57:26  <Scryer> Ninja work has saved me on several maps.
2011-12-19T02:57:27  <moduspwned> Does he accept bribes?
2011-12-19T02:57:28  <antimatroid> BenJackson: executing each bots code line by line
2011-12-19T02:57:40  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: in my case it was having a map of where enemy ants could be and projecting that back towards my hills, "shadowed" by my ants, and then scoring highly for positioning ants to block those things
2011-12-19T02:57:45  <_flag> moduspwned: I accept bribes on his behalf
2011-12-19T02:57:53  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: which amounts to saying it doesn't just intercept actual ants, it intercepts potential ants
2011-12-19T02:58:01  <Zaphus> (back) - how badly did I break things ?  I see no games have been played in almost an hour
2011-12-19T02:58:14  <Scryer> I love when my ninja waits for somebody to break through a defense, then zip in and snap up the hill.

2011-12-19T02:58:23  <antimatroid> i didn't try and intercept potential ants
2011-12-19T02:58:33  <antimatroid> i just collected the border like the unseen border
2011-12-19T02:58:42  <Zaphus> amstan: At least it happened now and wasnt something spotted in 24hrs time
2011-12-19T02:58:49  <amstan> Zaphus: though.. it could have been an undetected bug
2011-12-19T02:59:09  <amstan> that we never saw before because nobody checks ranking changes after every game
2011-12-19T02:59:10  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: my BFS code takes a passability function, and one which I use in a few places is that it can only travel toward some targets (which are from a previous bfs from those targets)
2011-12-19T02:59:19  <ChrisH_> my theory since the beginning is that the entire map rightfully belongs to me, so my bot tries to cover the map with visible area
2011-12-19T02:59:22  <Zaphus> I guess the server just couldnt comprehend my bot winning the game, and refused to believe it :-)
2011-12-19T02:59:35  <amstan> Zaphus: in theory we could recalculate the trueskill stuff
2011-12-19T02:59:42  <amstan> given the games
2011-12-19T02:59:48  <amstan> but in practice.. it's not implemented
2011-12-19T02:59:52  <a1k0n> i dunno, back when we got a game every 8 hours or whatever i think it would have been noticed
2011-12-19T02:59:52  <janzert> Zaphus: basically the situation you have triggered should be impossible :/
2011-12-19T03:00:01  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I have a map of booleans about where enemies could be which I push back by seeing space.  if I manage to pinch off an entire area I can know it's "safe"
2011-12-19T03:00:02  <antimatroid> i don't maximise vision
2011-12-19T03:00:03  <Zaphus> janzert: woohoo !
2011-12-19T03:00:14  <antimatroid> i go back to stuff that isn't recently seen, but it's of low priority
2011-12-19T03:00:17  <amstan> Zaphus: read: you shouldn't have won the game, lol
2011-12-19T03:00:24  <BenJackson> so I take the frontier of the "true" spots and bfs from that frontier toward my hills,

2011-12-19T03:00:49  <Zaphus> I get a certificate for effort and attendance :-)
2011-12-19T03:01:01  <BenJackson> where the first one is less than my ants that means a potential ant could reach some area before my ant

2011-12-19T03:01:41  <a1k0n> janzert: did the wiping of standings break it?  possibly the entry being missing initially?
2011-12-19T03:01:48  <BenJackson> after it has the map of those squares it does a few diffusions (the only place I actually diffuse) and uses that to draw in ants
2011-12-19T03:01:57  <Scryer> Sort of like doing last-minute fixes to your bot, eh?  But with everybody watching!
2011-12-19T03:02:05  <a1k0n> or like, if _everyone_ in the game has no current mu/sigma entries it doesn't work?
2011-12-19T03:02:08  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: ok, i get it, but I'll one up you, I do that for visible enemy with a single BFS.
2011-12-19T03:02:13  <BenJackson> you can see in the visualization how when it's working there are no potential ants anywhere that would reach my hill before hitting one of my ants
2011-12-19T03:02:16  <janzert> a1k0n: shouldn't be anything with that from what I can see

2011-12-19T03:03:30  <BenJackson> like one where I found the isosurface of my ants and enemy combat frontiers
2011-12-19T03:03:36  <BenJackson> and tried to walk to them
2011-12-19T03:03:41  <BenJackson> basically an intercept path
2011-12-19T03:03:42  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: when I'm searching for my ants to intercept an enemy ant, I do a search starting at the enemy ant, but it the search is constrained to not go outside the set of tiles equidistant from the nearest of my hills as the enemy ant

2011-12-19T03:05:40  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: so we are similar in that I do one BFS for each of my hills at the beginning of the turn to find the searchable areas, then another BFS from the enemy ant with the contraint provided by the first BFS, the first one of my ants I find is the closest of my ants that can intercept the enemy before it gets to my hill
2011-12-19T03:05:51  <a1k0n> you're claiming it sometimes updates everyone and sometimes doesn't?

2011-12-19T03:06:35  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: and the downhill values of the second search provide the path for the found ant to move in order to intercept
2011-12-19T03:06:36  <janzert> a1k0n: usually updates everyone, sometimes misses one
2011-12-19T03:06:39  <BenJackson> based on an initial set from the contest rules (no hills within 20 of mine)
2011-12-19T03:06:48  <peerai> janzert: only if it are diffrent transactions
2011-12-19T03:07:00  <BenJackson> when I can't see a square the "maybe ant" can advance in all directions
2011-12-19T03:07:12  <BenJackson> the nice offshoot of this is that my bot can be totally uninterested in known-safe areas
2011-12-19T03:07:16  <BenJackson> like big cul-de-sacs
2011-12-19T03:07:54  <janzert> peerai: so a later transaction can have missing inserts from a transaction that completed before starting that one?
2011-12-19T03:07:56  <BenJackson> antimatroid suggested the idea of the potential ant function
2011-12-19T03:08:05  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: that's cool, my bot doesn't know that explicitly
2011-12-19T03:08:25  <peerai> janzert: check if you do the commits correctly

2011-12-19T03:08:59  <BenJackson> the first time my V10 (or 11) played on that I put way too many ants back there
2011-12-19T03:09:06  <Vaenom> BenJackson: is cul-de-sacs a known word to english speakers?
2011-12-19T03:09:09  <a1k0n> yeah i thought about it but didn't add it
2011-12-19T03:09:12  <BenJackson> Vaenom: yes
2011-12-19T03:09:13  <peerai> janzert: if a transactions starts after the commit it will not be able to mis the commited values
2011-12-19T03:09:26  <antimatroid> it's all about what you wanted your bot to do in the end though

2011-12-19T03:14:56  <moduspwned> a1k0n: you won the first contest right?
2011-12-19T03:15:06  <a1k0n> antimatroid: it's kind of.. distributed so as to be updated incrementally
2011-12-19T03:15:14  <Vaenom> BenJackson: if you tell me your bot is smart enough to do that kind of things, I'll be impressed Sir
2011-12-19T03:15:14  <Zaphus> ChrisH_: yeah, I think I learnt the word from the movie "Labyrinth" many years ago
2011-12-19T03:15:15  <a1k0n> moduspwned: well, amstan won the first first one
2011-12-19T03:15:17  <a1k0n> i won the tron one.
2011-12-19T03:15:27  <moduspwned> a1k0n: what was before tron?
2011-12-19T03:15:28  <thestinger> moduspwned: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Challenge there's a little table there
2011-12-19T03:15:29  <amstan> there were more before rps i think

2011-12-19T03:15:54  <amstan> a1k0n: i made the article

2011-12-19T03:16:21  <antimatroid> that's my evaluate function, i'd be curious if people did it any differently?
2011-12-19T03:16:24  <moduspwned> I think the choices of games has gotten better and better
2011-12-19T03:16:41  <amstan> antimatroid: that's big
2011-12-19T03:17:10  <a1k0n> oh for combat?
2011-12-19T03:17:14  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-19T03:17:24  <a1k0n> mine's impossible to explain
2011-12-19T03:17:41  *** Kurnevsky <Kurnevsky!~Errins@ns.bsuir.by> has left #aichallenge
2011-12-19T03:18:04  <Vaenom> hmmmmmm. I'd totally hit Jennifer Connelly in the 'Oubliette'
2011-12-19T03:18:33  <a1k0n> i have points for each square on the map.  i have points for each food, each of my ants and each visible enemy ant
2011-12-19T03:18:48  <a1k0n> and those things all change as ants move
2011-12-19T03:19:05  <Zaphus> My combat is simple, but I put in one thing that *might* be unique - I watch for "Static" ants... if I'm in a standoff and the opponent doesnt move for N turns (N=3 in final version), then I assume they won't move on the next turn and will make an attack move
2011-12-19T03:19:10  <a1k0n> so i only update the minimum necessary for correctness as i provisionally move ants
2011-12-19T03:19:20  <amstan> Vaenom: have you noticed that most of the wikipedia pictures for actors suck?
2011-12-19T03:19:24  <antimatroid> Zaphus: i considered doing that but never did
2011-12-19T03:19:31  <antimatroid> i suspect it would work well though

2011-12-19T03:19:46  <a1k0n> it was switchable and i don't know if he enabled it for the final contest
2011-12-19T03:19:55  <thestinger> amstan: there's this photographer guy that's taken like all the pics for celebrities
2011-12-19T03:19:57  <thestinger> forget his name
2011-12-19T03:20:04  <BenJackson> I also do the don't-move thing but with slight randomness
2011-12-19T03:20:07  <BenJackson> to avoid being gamed
2011-12-19T03:20:11  <thestinger> amstan: well, all the good ones :P
2011-12-19T03:20:14  <antimatroid> one of my friend has an insane number of pictures on wikipedia
2011-12-19T03:20:25  <Zaphus> antimatroid: It's very effective at resolving small standoffs.   Had to put code so that if a static ant has another ant move next to it, or die near it, then it resets to not static - assuming that the change might wake up the AI
2011-12-19T03:20:33  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JJ_Harrison
2011-12-19T03:21:19  <kincody> i wrote a wiki on Competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence after the first contest..
2011-12-19T03:21:33  <antimatroid> did you get arimaa?
2011-12-19T03:21:36  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: I also check for static ants and assume they won't move.
2011-12-19T03:21:49  <Vaenom> amstan- yea, that's wikipedia ways to motivate them to give mooooooooooooooore
2011-12-19T03:21:56  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: has it ever bit you on the bum?

2011-12-19T03:22:13  <Zaphus> ChrisH_ : how many moves ?  if it's exactly 3 then our guys will slam into each other :-)
2011-12-19T03:22:17  <ChrisH_> occassionally, but not too bad
2011-12-19T03:22:50  <antimatroid> it would be interesting to write a counter static checker
2011-12-19T03:22:55  <kincody> i mean planet wars..
2011-12-19T03:22:59  <antimatroid> try to work out how long you need to be static before they'll make stupid moves
2011-12-19T03:23:00  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: one move, but I also verify that there were no dead ants in the vicinity, because sometimes a combat occurred that killed ants and they were the only one's to move, creating a falso positive
2011-12-19T03:23:34  <antimatroid> aka playing timed out
2011-12-19T03:23:45  <Zaphus> antimatroid: I thought of making mine variable, start at 2 - then if I start losing ants to those moves, push it to N+1   - but it hurt my brain so I didnt do it
2011-12-19T03:23:55  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: interesting.  I didn't consider that
2011-12-19T03:24:00  <ChrisH_> and I also require that none of my ants in the combat moved from the previous turn either, because if i had then the input to the enemies function will have changed and they may move now
2011-12-19T03:24:08  <antimatroid> yeah

2011-12-19T03:24:33  <BenJackson> all these clever things I could add to my bot...
2011-12-19T03:24:42  <antimatroid> i don't remove duplicate moves from my game trees either, since they're so cheap anyway i didn't see the point
2011-12-19T03:24:45  <ChrisH_> that was just added very near the end, but it played well in testing, so I kept it
2011-12-19T03:24:51  <grokodile> question - play has stopped while you sort out the database problem?
2011-12-19T03:24:57  <antimatroid> yep

2011-12-19T03:25:23  <moduspwned> antimatroid: so you just issue duplicate orders?
2011-12-19T03:25:39  <antimatroid> no, i have to pick one set of moves
2011-12-19T03:25:43  <ChrisH_> sometimes it hurts me in the big wall standoffs, but it really helped finish off ants i've surrounded near a hill and get the points sooner
2011-12-19T03:25:44  <antimatroid> i just possible evaluate the same set twice

2011-12-19T03:29:21  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: I managed to come up with a very simple (and fast) formula for estimating the number of positions I would need to evaluate for any given battle partition, which really helped my code pick how to merge battles and evaluate as many as possible in a turn
2011-12-19T03:29:21  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/imX2uBM2 assume you want to bfs from the *'s to the a's and move them towards them optimally
2011-12-19T03:29:25  <janzert> test as in I'm just running one, not as in it doesn't count
2011-12-19T03:30:14  <antimatroid> the bottom right 'a' should step down and walk around, an 'a' in line should step out and walk around for the 'trapped 'a'', and you can't not search over friends because you need to move the a with a gap down

2011-12-19T03:30:45  <a1k0n> well.  but you're going after three food so not that many ants need to go there.
2011-12-19T03:30:51  <antimatroid> ignore food

2011-12-19T03:40:52  <ChrisH_> Vaenom: why did you need to bfs AND A*?, if you BFS from your targets to the ants then the local BFS values near your ant tell you which way to go for the shortest path back to the target
2011-12-19T03:40:59  <accessdenied> So, it is not so quick.

2011-12-19T03:41:57  <Vaenom> hmm,  200 more ants each BFS'ing 600 nodes each, each turns, and then A*'ing a target .. and I don't time out.  And this includes the battle code, which is pretty cheap, of course

2011-12-19T03:43:48  <accessdenied> Sad that I had two days only. First I didn't have time due to work. Then there was illness for one week. And two last days I spent on ants. Good that I took part in similar challenge in the past and had path finding implemented alredy.
2011-12-19T03:43:52  <moduspwned> oh boy they  started again!
2011-12-19T03:43:53  <Vaenom> ChrisH_  do you know the expresion "The occasion makes the moron"?   just had the opportunity to be stupid and lazy and took it.
2011-12-19T03:43:55  <janzert> Scryer: most likely to be for a while
2011-12-19T03:43:56  <moduspwned> is it working?
2011-12-19T03:44:07  <accessdenied> Good that this time I really UNDERSTOOD how it works :-D
2011-12-19T03:44:14  <Scryer> Congrats on getting it running again, though!
2011-12-19T03:44:14  <BenJackson> janzert: did you figure out why that insert didn't work?
2011-12-19T03:44:42  <moduspwned> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=274069 best game so far
2011-12-19T03:44:50  <Vaenom> ChrisH_ using A* had some advantage for a few reasons, so as long as I didn't had a perfomance problem, I would get those advantages and skip some coding
2011-12-19T03:44:53  <ChrisH_> Vaenom: fair enough, as you say, your bot doesn't time out, so no need to change, I practiced that too, but I think my combat code is a lot more compute intesive than yours so I was forced to make my pathing code fast so I had enough time for combat.
2011-12-19T03:45:18  <ChrisH_> Vaenom: what advantage did A* give you?
2011-12-19T03:45:18  <accessdenied> By the way, does somebody know what it means when shrinking circle appears around enemy hill?
2011-12-19T03:45:19  <janzert> BenJackson: my guess is because no explicit transactions and the update is being done on another connection for what reason I don't know
2011-12-19T03:45:39  <janzert> accessdenied: means it will be razed soon
2011-12-19T03:45:40  <BenJackson> janzert: so solution was to wrap in a transaction?
2011-12-19T03:45:42  <kincody> theroriticaly 100,000 sould take 0.10 ms since the maximum number of tiles posible is 255*255 ~ 65000 it sould take less than .10 ms
2011-12-19T03:45:44  <moduspwned> accessdenied: it is about to be captured, jsut letting you know to look
2011-12-19T03:45:45  <janzert> BenJackson: right
2011-12-19T03:45:57  <accessdenied> Shame on me, I didn't implemented hills handling but my ants hunt hills if there is such circle. It looks like food in the place of hill...
2011-12-19T03:46:29  <accessdenied> Hm...
2011-12-19T03:46:30  <ChrisH_> kincody: actually the maximum number of tiles is now set at 25,000
2011-12-19T03:46:32  <Vaenom> ChrisH: Improving my battle system would have forced me to fix my mess, no doubt about it.  I got what I paid for..
2011-12-19T03:46:39  <moduspwned> accessdenied: the circle doesnt exist to the ants, only a way to visuallize what happens
2011-12-19T03:47:04  <accessdenied> Well, if it is an effect only, then may be I have implemented hills handling but didn't noticed it :-D
2011-12-19T03:47:14  <janzert> accessdenied: ants don't see the circle at all it's just a visualizer thing
2011-12-19T03:47:43  <moduspwned> ohhh a new game up, looks like some ants that actually do stuff
2011-12-19T03:47:51  <janzert> the hill information is given to your bot rather similar to food though
2011-12-19T03:47:57  <NaturalStupidity> Noooooooo, Lobster has been beaten :(
2011-12-19T03:48:06  <BenJackson> All hail ArthurD
2011-12-19T03:48:17  <moduspwned> how?!
2011-12-19T03:48:23  <Vaenom> ChrisH_ A*, the implementation I have is great (lot of parameters, custom algo etc) and I realized that playing with those parameters allowed me to give my ants some behaviors I wouldn't know how to implement easily if I wanted to
2011-12-19T03:48:26  <moduspwned> why did he get more points? oh there were more people in the game?
2011-12-19T03:48:43  <praveen_> only one server running for games right now?
2011-12-19T03:48:48  <ChrisH_> Vaenom: oh, did you write the A* yourself?
2011-12-19T03:48:50  <kincody> you probably have to multiply the number of instructions inside the loop

2011-12-19T03:51:07  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah
2011-12-19T03:51:08  <Vaenom> ChrisH_   just per example, in the last 30 minutes before midnight, I found out that by switching the method from Manathan to Euclideans for normal walking and keeping Manathan for walking just before a battle was improving the bot results a lot ...   and I think I'll probably end up one 100 ranks higher because of that  lol
2011-12-19T03:51:14  <janzert> looking good, bringing up a few more workers now

2011-12-19T03:54:01  <BenJackson> it's in a wiki somewhere

2011-12-19T03:55:45  <antimatroid> i think i would for food
2011-12-19T03:55:46  <NaturalStupidity> that'll timeout quite a few bad bfs implementations
2011-12-19T03:55:50  <moduspwned> probably crash someones code

2011-12-19T03:56:02  <Zaphus> should at least be a testcase
2011-12-19T03:56:07  <BenJackson> every game I've viewed so far with a "real" win condition has had a bot time out
2011-12-19T03:56:53  <kincody> ChrisH: is 25,000 tile limit mentioned in the game spec?
2011-12-19T03:57:00  <antimatroid> the only thing that could make that map better is different hill placements
2011-12-19T03:57:13  <ChrisH_> kincody: yes, I believe in the map generator specs
2011-12-19T03:57:18  <moduspwned> Also, if they at the last minute for the finals, had food randomly disappear as well as be added

2011-12-19T03:57:33  <ChrisH_> kincody: but it was updated to that fairly recently, last couple weeks I think
2011-12-19T03:57:38  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=274066 <- look at that diagonal wall between the base pairs
2011-12-19T03:57:53  <antimatroid> my bot could handle disappearing food actually
2011-12-19T03:57:57  <antimatroid> not disappearing water though
2011-12-19T03:57:59  <ChrisH_> my bot would see that the area was surrounded by water and mark the interior as water from then on and ignore it
2011-12-19T03:58:12  <antimatroid> yeah, i wouldn't have a path to it in my graph
2011-12-19T03:58:19  <antimatroid> each square in my grid has a vector of land neighbours
2011-12-19T03:58:41  <moduspwned> I just marked something with three water walls as being water
2011-12-19T03:58:49  <BenJackson> my bot would see that and bfs from the foods but find no ants
2011-12-19T03:58:52  <BenJackson> so it would waste some time
2011-12-19T03:58:55  <moduspwned> my ants atcually thought it was water
2011-12-19T03:58:59  <BenJackson> but it wouldn't try to explore it once it saw it was sealed off
2011-12-19T03:59:04  <ChrisH_> yeah, mine too, but my bot actually uses the results of one of the BFS searches out from a hill and checks if there are any totally unreachable areas and marks them as water
2011-12-19T03:59:05  <kincody> ok its ok game spec... i should have noticed that

2011-12-19T04:06:31  <Fluxid> aw yeah, more games~~~~
2011-12-19T04:06:32  <antimatroid> Fluxid: janzert thinks he's fixed the problem, just slowly re adding everything to make sure
2011-12-19T04:06:51  <moduspwned> I really like the strange defense formations
2011-12-19T04:06:54  <NaturalStupidity> any interesting games so far?

2011-12-19T04:08:26  <kincody> only defence i have is my bots cuting off before timeing out and causing a cross like formation when my bot takes too much time

2011-12-19T04:40:26  <raver1975> or a map with no way to reach the enemy
2011-12-19T04:40:35  <Minthos> my pathfinding checks remaining time before it starts, and assumes it will finish in a certain amount of time
2011-12-19T04:40:39  <Zaphus> antimatroid: it could be a while before you see a game, it's going to be 10-20 hours to get through everyones first game by my calculations...
2011-12-19T04:40:45  <antimatroid> that would be a decision problem
2011-12-19T04:40:55  <Minthos> maps bigger than what's legal would time it out instantly

2011-12-19T04:43:06  <janzert> the first 4 rounds consist of 7124 matches and that is less than a days worth of games :)
2011-12-19T04:43:06  <Zaphus> 22 players per minutes, I guess that's possible

2011-12-19T04:43:59  <janzert> I thought I mentioned it in a forum post before, but don't ask me where ;)
2011-12-19T04:44:17  <janzert> basically the first 4 rounds are random pairings to get the pairing system seeded
2011-12-19T04:44:44  <janzert> then after the start bot ranks have stabilized to group them together the pairing cutoff will start going up

2011-12-19T04:46:53  <Zaphus> my 20hrs calculation is wrong, or rather, it's right but it's 20 hours between seedings - so those who sit in the 'good seats' in the standings will get more games in that time (people that other bots want to play)
2011-12-19T04:47:47  <Zaphus> janzert: understandable, it works better as a different person being the public face - but then you need that extra person, and need them to be awake at the right time :-)

2011-12-19T04:51:02  <janzert> ahh, yeah
2011-12-19T04:51:29  <janzert> I've seen that before, the game list got generated in the middle of them being added to the database

2011-12-19T04:52:21  <codetiger> oh, but I can see the game in visualizer and nothing wrong. So just when its getting displayed

2011-12-19T04:52:37  <antimatroid> fourmidable in 30th place :D
2011-12-19T04:53:08  <janzert> yep it was game 274431 and 274432
2011-12-19T04:53:19  <janzert> you can scroll down and find them to see they're fine now

2011-12-19T04:56:31  <codetiger> simple calculations give me 6 hrs approximate to do one round
2011-12-19T04:57:55  <janzert> the average game now is going much quicker than yesterday of course :)
2011-12-19T04:58:56  <Fluxid> because in average game half players are starter bots? ;)
2011-12-19T04:59:06  <janzert> pretty much
2011-12-19T04:59:46  <Zaphus> janzert: did you say it's random pairings for the first 4 games ?   that *should* leave the top several hundred at the right end of the ladder (undefeated), unless someone gets extremely unlucky
2011-12-19T04:59:58  <codetiger> how do you filter starter bots... am afraid, if my bot gets chance to play 4 games all with top 10 bots and loose obviously, will you mark it as start bot?
2011-12-19T05:00:28  <janzert> Zaphus: yep, and trueskill will then start pairing them all against each other
2011-12-19T05:00:40  <Zaphus> janzert: nice, was wondering how you'd handle that
2011-12-19T05:01:04  <antimatroid> who was saying MomoBot was ranked too highly? http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=273906&user=31
2011-12-19T05:01:12  <janzert> codetiger: the starter bots will never be explicitly filtered
2011-12-19T05:01:34  <janzert> just after their rank has stabilized a bit the pairing cutoff will go up past them
2011-12-19T05:02:16  <Fluxid> still no rank ;(
2011-12-19T05:02:21  <codetiger> hope it doesn't get past mine... I've put 3 weeks of good amount of time...
2011-12-19T05:03:00  <janzert> Eventually it will go up to just the top 250-500 bots, but that will be close to the end

2011-12-19T05:14:48  <kincody> my ranking is probably because of the no of ppl i defeted.. you just have to pray for more opponents

2011-12-19T05:22:14  <Frantic_> I'm seeing weird twitching behaviour though; kind of sucks discovering that right after the submissions closed. Never mind....
2011-12-19T05:22:18  <praveen_> Vow, 27 servers up now
2011-12-19T05:22:29  <janzert> so I'm curious did anybody do speed test with their bot on pypy and cpython?
2011-12-19T05:22:33  <Fluxid> rank 3391 is processed now
2011-12-19T05:22:42  <janzert> wondering how much speed up pypy was giving for a bot
2011-12-19T05:22:47  <kincody> lisp is back on top for unfortunately its not gonna last
2011-12-19T05:23:05  <codetiger> pypy was 12 times faster in my case
2011-12-19T05:23:15  <janzert> sweet
2011-12-19T05:23:52  <codetiger> the same bot with just py+numpy also didn't do that good results.
2011-12-19T05:24:07  <codetiger> may be my bad implementation of numpy,
2011-12-19T05:24:14  <Wraithan> 15x faster
2011-12-19T05:24:17  <Wraithan> for me
2011-12-19T05:24:27  <codetiger> then I had to remove all bumpy and use just pypy
2011-12-19T05:24:30  <codetiger> :)
2011-12-19T05:24:50  <Wraithan> with cpython you don't get to hack in python you get to hack in numpy/cython
2011-12-19T05:24:54  <janzert> did you try pypy's minimal amount of numpy implementation at all?
2011-12-19T05:24:54  <Wraithan> which is meh at best
2011-12-19T05:25:04  <Kettling> I discovered it was not possible to do a day's work while overtired and also secretly writing gaming code. I think a few hours worth of hastily put together battle code doesn't quite do the job.
2011-12-19T05:25:06  <janzert> numpypy module if I remember right
2011-12-19T05:25:32  <Wraithan> janzert: yeah, it is only a partial implementation and I didn't feel like figuring out what was there and what wasn't
2011-12-19T05:25:43  <codetiger> I didn't try numpypy
2011-12-19T05:25:49  <Wraithan> plus with pypy if you just stick to tight loops it gets REALLY fast
2011-12-19T05:26:00  <Wraithan> since it is a trace jited VM
2011-12-19T05:26:07  <janzert> yeah, I haven't really looked at it but I get the feeling what is there is more of a demo than enough to be very useful
2011-12-19T05:26:13  <grokodile> praveen_ where are you looking to see how many servers are on?
2011-12-19T05:26:15  <janzert> right
2011-12-19T05:26:18  <codetiger> but read numpypy should have helped much more
2011-12-19T05:26:29  <Wraithan> s/should/could/
2011-12-19T05:26:39  <Wraithan> really pypy is so fast that it is more than ok
2011-12-19T05:26:49  <Fluxid> < Wraithan> with cpython you don't get to hack in python you get to hack in numpy/cython  well, i hacked normal cpython extension in raw c
2011-12-19T05:26:59  <codetiger> grokodile: check bottom left "server statistics"
2011-12-19T05:26:59  <Wraithan> Fluxid: or that
2011-12-19T05:27:02  <Wraithan> fuck that
2011-12-19T05:27:08  <janzert> really glad to hear pypy did so well with bots
2011-12-19T05:27:21  <Fluxid> just because i wanted to stick to python3, if not that i'd just use pypy
2011-12-19T05:27:24  <Wraithan> If I am going to hack in python then I don't want to have to hack in C
2011-12-19T05:27:29  <janzert> I've been cheering for pypy for a very long time now :)
2011-12-19T05:27:44  <Wraithan> Fluxid: I started with cpython3 but it is so fucking slow
2011-12-19T05:27:50  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-12-19T05:28:00  <Wraithan> I want to believe in python3
2011-12-19T05:28:20  <Wraithan> once the bigger frameworks start supporting it I might get to use it in my day job

2011-12-19T05:43:50  <Wraithan> Then how was cpython the same speed?
2011-12-19T05:43:54  <Zaphus> Xathis got his first game (a win, obviously)
2011-12-19T05:43:55  <Wraithan> lots of other IO?
2011-12-19T05:44:13  <Wraithan> I have a hard time believing that cpython kept up with pypy
2011-12-19T05:44:26  <janzert> Zaphus: what a surprise ;)
2011-12-19T05:45:15  <Zaphus> looks like the first round is past the halfway mark now

2011-12-19T05:46:01  <janzert> yep, just under 3000 have not played yet
2011-12-19T05:46:55  <codetiger> mine is one among those 3000
2011-12-19T05:46:56  <codetiger> :(
2011-12-19T05:46:57  <Fluxid> Wraithan: can't say much. other problem is that we use lots of XML parsing and serialization (XML-based communication), that wasn't benchmarked ad there is no working lxml. and part of app that was benchmarked got faster after ~1000 iterations, which wouldn't happen in days - there is shitload of code
2011-12-19T05:47:10  <Wraithan> Ah
2011-12-19T05:47:13  <Wraithan> ok
2011-12-19T05:47:50  <Zaphus> Would you agree that there are 4000 or more 'starter' bots ?  i.e. bots that perform at starter level or below ?    If so, thats about half... some starters may win their first four games just by the luck of the draw :-)
2011-12-19T05:48:08  <Fluxid> (and instances are often replaced, so jit state would be often dropped before it god warmed up)
2011-12-19T05:48:19  <Wraithan> Fluxid: lame
2011-12-19T05:49:00  <Wraithan> pypy is slow without a warm up unfortunately.
2011-12-19T05:49:12  <Fluxid> yup
2011-12-19T05:49:52  <Zaphus> 58 players per minute, that puts us at about 51 minutes away from the second round (given that the games are only those with no games so far)

2011-12-19T05:51:00  <Zaphus> wish there was a way to show the stats for a specific set of bots, i.e. Xathis, Memetix, etc - to see how they are faring at the moment
2011-12-19T05:51:23  <grokodile> The estimated time till next game on the profile page is surely not correct?  I've had a game already, so it will be more than 13 minutes till my next one!
2011-12-19T05:51:41  <grokodile> In fact, it seems to be advancing by about a minute every half hour or so!
2011-12-19T05:51:49  <Fluxid> ok, page 50 has got some games
2011-12-19T05:51:59  <Fluxid> 20 more
2011-12-19T05:52:00  <janzert> yeah, next game calculation is completely wrong atm
2011-12-19T05:52:36  <grokodile> completely
2011-12-19T05:52:50  <grokodile> guess it will get better when the first round is complete?
2011-12-19T05:53:08  <nibohr> there is a new number 1
2011-12-19T05:53:11  <janzert> not till the first 4 rounds are finished
2011-12-19T05:53:30  <janzert> the first 4 rounds are completely prescheduled and the profile display doesn't handle that
2011-12-19T05:53:35  <Zaphus> 3000 bots to go at ~60 per minute = 50 minutes until round 2.  How does round 2 get done, pick a seed, then find some who havent played the right number of games and play the match ?  or just find a whole random bunch ?
2011-12-19T05:53:59  <janzert> first 4 rounds are completely random
2011-12-19T05:54:41  <janzert> you can see manager/random_pairing.py to see how it was done if you're interested in the details
2011-12-19T05:55:03  <janzert> basically though just went through a shuffled list of all players and paired them up
2011-12-19T05:55:06  <janzert> 4 times
2011-12-19T05:55:39  <grokodile> If there is some complicated story about how the finals are running, perhaps you should put it on the website or the forum?  I'm sure lots of people would be interested.
2011-12-19T05:55:44  <codetiger> my bot is still struggling to get the first game
2011-12-19T05:57:38  <janzert> codetiger: you're about 140 games out

2011-12-19T06:34:20  <Wraithan> Is it desired for the next competition to have an API for looking up stats? I noticed that I had to resort to screen scraping when I wanted to have a command to look up stats for my friends and I in an IRC channel
2011-12-19T06:35:42  <janzert> what sort of stats? rankings and such are available as json
2011-12-19T06:36:20  <UncleVasya> Take a look at the McLeopold's foe-lios feature requirement on the github.
2011-12-19T06:37:49  <Wraithan> janzert: is it documented somewhere? I did a cursory glance and didn't see anything
2011-12-19T06:38:07  <GreenTea> i see on all games played page some strange games like:

2011-12-19T06:39:08  <UncleVasya> I mean there is the idea to work with :-)
2011-12-19T06:39:30  <UncleVasya> I think it is better then api.
2011-12-19T06:39:39  <GreenTea> or feature ^^
2011-12-19T06:39:42  <janzert> sort of, just shouldn't be listed until they are completely in

2011-12-19T06:44:03  <Wraithan> UncleVasya: not better than an API when you want to display the numbers in an IRC channel rather than a website.
2011-12-19T06:44:24  <Wraithan> g0llum: a page that does some json stuff is nice but there is no documentation so it might as well not exist.
2011-12-19T06:44:29  <ikaros> Next game should be within 2816 minutes
2011-12-19T06:44:41  <ikaros> seems pretty long if you want to run the finals in a few days
2011-12-19T06:44:48  <g0llum> Wraitha, yea, you're right.
2011-12-19T06:45:12  <Wraithan> I'd rather build with screen scraping than against an API that is undocumented (and from the looks of the code, can't be filtered in the way I need filtering anyway)
2011-12-19T06:46:20  <g0llum> beautifulSoup
2011-12-19T06:46:44  <Wraithan> Yes, I know how to screen scrap
2011-12-19T06:47:35  <Wraithan> I am already using BeautifulSoup with requests to do it currently which works well enough but makes the server do a lot more work than what I need it for.
2011-12-19T06:47:51  <janzert> Zaphus: it's fine now, probably another manifestation of partial insert
2011-12-19T06:48:14  <Wraithan> Mostly it is a want to be a better citizen, rather than a problem with getting the data out.

2011-12-19T07:10:13  <sir_macelon> GreenTea: well, I finally found out some time this weekend to fix the disaster of my last upload :)
2011-12-19T07:10:19  <Fluxid> are you going to beat everyone's ass?
2011-12-19T07:10:39  <GreenTea> ^_^
2011-12-19T07:10:40  <sir_macelon> over last month I didn't touch the code
2011-12-19T07:10:49  <sir_macelon> got new job and moved to ireland
2011-12-19T07:10:57  <Fluxid> !
2011-12-19T07:11:13  <GreenTea> from Poland?
2011-12-19T07:11:14  <sir_macelon> hopefully looking for top-5 finish
2011-12-19T07:11:20  <sir_macelon> GreenTea: yup
2011-12-19T07:11:25  <GreenTea> cool..

2011-12-19T07:12:14  <sir_macelon> but I've seen quite a bunch of strong entries over last month

2011-12-19T07:13:12  <Fluxid> sir_macelon: what do you do now?
2011-12-19T07:13:59  <Fluxid> sir_macelon: damn, i had *small* hopes for landing close/higher to you in rankings but it turns out i have no chances now ;)
2011-12-19T07:14:03  <sir_macelon> Fluxid: software development of an eclipse rcp based application
2011-12-19T07:14:09  <GreenTea> Accoun, do you play this time?
2011-12-19T07:14:56  <Fluxid> cool
2011-12-19T07:15:47  <sir_macelon> Fluxid: thanks for hosting the tcp server btw, altough I hadn't used it a lot
2011-12-19T07:16:01  <Fluxid> np
2011-12-19T07:16:41  <Fluxid> ah, i think i can publish the code now
2011-12-19T07:16:48  <GreenTea> Fluxid, also thanks for TQC server, but 5000 ms turn time is to high..
2011-12-19T07:17:03  <Fluxid> GreenTea: at the end i was sending 500ms to client
2011-12-19T07:17:05  <GreenTea> i had games for 1 hour, 40 minutes..
2011-12-19T07:17:18  <Fluxid> while engine still had 5s

2011-12-19T07:17:47  <Zaphus> Fluxid: too many bots ignored it, I was also having 1hr+ games at the end
2011-12-19T07:18:35  <Fluxid> Zaphus: their fault. they risked timeouts on main server
2011-12-19T07:18:41  <Zaphus> fluxid: but it was great to have it there and be able to test bots all night
2011-12-19T07:19:05  <janzert> speaking of turn time, I'm really hoping next contest we can go back to 1000ms at least
2011-12-19T07:19:13  <grokodile> I noticed the high turn time, and assumed that you guys were aiming to get it right first, and only the think about getting it fast - the way software development should go.
2011-12-19T07:19:35  <Zaphus> janzert: less turns in a game though !  1000 turns x 1000ms = a long wait!
2011-12-19T07:19:44  <janzert> yep
2011-12-19T07:20:01  <janzert> back to 200 turn maximum would be nice :)
2011-12-19T07:20:03  <janzert> or less
2011-12-19T07:20:19  <janzert> certainly hoping for a less resource intensive game next time
2011-12-19T07:20:27  <Zaphus> or, a pool of time for your game (chess clock style) - e.g. 200s for the whole game, you spend it where you want
2011-12-19T07:20:46  <janzert> well a pool plus maximum per turn would be nice
2011-12-19T07:20:51  *** eskymaci <eskymaci!93fb0a35@gateway/web/freenode/ip.147.251.10.53> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-19T07:20:53  <Zaphus> yeah
2011-12-19T07:21:03  <janzert> otherwise if a bot gets stuck in a loop it's a mess
2011-12-19T07:21:24  <Zaphus> but I'd kill for a 50ms max too, so we could actually test a lot of games per hour!
2011-12-19T07:21:28  <ikaros> why? it turns out after it consumed the full time
2011-12-19T07:21:48  <ikaros> ehh s/turns/times
2011-12-19T07:21:52  <janzert> ikaros: that's a lot of wasted server time
2011-12-19T07:22:20  <Fluxid> https://github.com/fluxid/flantob here's my bot
2011-12-19T07:22:29  <ikaros> true but it would be a nice time control
2011-12-19T07:22:38  <Zaphus> how about a massive world game, every single player on the map at the same time, all 8000+, at least we'd all get games at the same rate :-)
2011-12-19T07:23:13  <ikaros> you could also require the bot to give an alive signal every x seconds
2011-12-19T07:23:18  <ikaros> to see if it timed out :)
2011-12-19T07:23:38  <janzert> Zaphus: I think that'd be really cool and have given it a bit of thought, but also really hard to do
2011-12-19T07:25:15  <GarfTop> The ratio of Python to PyPy submissions (also in top 200) is interesting. Most of the top Python coders must have used C or numpy.
2011-12-19T07:25:37  <GarfTop> I'm assuing anyone in the top 200 at least bothered to check for PyPy.
2011-12-19T07:26:43  <Zaphus> 'night all, time for bed here... will check how all the Aussies are faring in the morning
2011-12-19T07:27:19  <janzert> yeah, since it's now daylight out again I'm going to go take a nap soon as well

2011-12-19T07:28:21  <retybok> The language with the highest ranked players on average was C++11, last I checked
2011-12-19T07:28:32  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2211 poor bot
2011-12-19T07:28:43  <retybok> Russia, estonia and France tended to produce highly ranked players
2011-12-19T07:29:24  <ikaros> one should do the statistics for the top x-thousand only
2011-12-19T07:29:36  <ikaros> so the starter bots are left out
2011-12-19T07:29:52  <retybok> ikaros: that's why I made histograms, not averages or similar metrics

2011-12-19T07:37:21  <retybok> I think as long as you chose a language with decent runtime performance, you're fine

2011-12-19T07:48:51  <retybok> I don't know, haskell seems pretty well suited for the challenge as there is almost no IO
2011-12-19T07:48:53  <Speedy_Consoles> what about lbeck?

2011-12-19T07:56:13  <mcstar> all the competitive stuff happened in it, and there was no point writing it in lisp, it would be very ugly anyway

2011-12-19T07:57:28  <mcstar> i guess python needs it that way, but why?

2011-12-19T08:26:48  <Wraithan> antimatroid: you can see their ranking at time of playing the game next to their name in the list of the games played
2011-12-19T08:27:11  <antimatroid> oh yeah i see

2011-12-19T08:27:34  <antimatroid> it has my highest as 26 there :(
2011-12-19T08:27:37  <antimatroid> i finished top 25
2011-12-19T08:27:48  <antimatroid> flukily i think
2011-12-19T08:27:52  <antimatroid> the sigma was way high
2011-12-19T08:28:50  <pairofdice> top-10 finish maybe
2011-12-19T08:28:50  <retybok> How many games is everyone going to get for the final rankings?
2011-12-19T08:29:02  <pairofdice> Depends
2011-12-19T08:29:22  <pairofdice> There's a minimum amount of games set I think
2011-12-19T08:29:41  <antimatroid> pairofdice: very very unlikely imo
2011-12-19T08:29:48  <pairofdice> When we get above that, bots will start dropping off
2011-12-19T08:30:01  <antimatroid> i'd be pleasantly surprised with top 20, i'd be astounded if my bot got top 10

2011-12-19T08:30:18  <antimatroid> i expect it not to though
2011-12-19T08:30:31  <praveen> probably at this rate we might get around 10 games
2011-12-19T08:30:50  <pairofdice> I would be happy with top 300 finish, would make it easier to improve in the next challenge :>

2011-12-19T08:50:28  <egreavette> The map looks okay.  a bit of mix between random walk and maze
2011-12-19T08:50:40  <Wraithan> xyxan: 1000 turn limit reached, you won by default, not by rank stabilizaiton

2011-12-19T09:07:16  <Fluxid> top of the ranking still isn't close to what it was before
2011-12-19T09:07:17  * avdg is almost playing game 3
2011-12-19T09:07:50  <Speedy_Consoles> since there is no one with more than 2 games
2011-12-19T09:08:19  <avdg> well I had 171 players before when the deadline ended
2011-12-19T09:09:01  <moduspwned> the player currently in first timed out both of his games!!!!
2011-12-19T09:09:15  <Speedy_Consoles> i like the file name "cstuff.c"
2011-12-19T09:09:15  <xyxan> yes i pointed out that before
2011-12-19T09:09:15  <besh> flagcapper,greentea,benjackson all have low number of opponents in both games.
2011-12-19T09:09:16  <xyxan> :D
2011-12-19T09:09:16  <sir_macelon> so far 2 wins out of 2 for me :)
2011-12-19T09:09:31  <avdg> yeah, its kind of annoying to lose from a bot which times out :/
2011-12-19T09:10:29  <xyxan> its kind of annoying as well if one have match with only top 900 previously ranked Botz :(
2011-12-19T09:10:57  <besh> fluxid: is python a good language to learn? I don't understand it much
2011-12-19T09:11:20  <Fluxid> besh: i like it very much and i get money for coding in it
2011-12-19T09:11:23  <Fluxid> so, yes
2011-12-19T09:11:24  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-12-19T09:11:45  <Fluxid> it can get shit done, if this is what you ask about
2011-12-19T09:11:58  <Fluxid> still depends what kind of shit
2011-12-19T09:12:16  <besh> Well then i will try to use it in the next contest. I learned java with this one.

2011-12-19T09:25:51  <Fluxid> awww, fell below 300 again... i want 3rd game already :(
2011-12-19T09:25:52  <antimatroid> i should have been able to stop them from razing those two hills
2011-12-19T09:26:14  <antimatroid> what happened was my game tree didn't tiebreak moving onto enemy hills early enough
2011-12-19T09:26:31  <pairofdice> That "Next game should be within 1258 minutes." Is lying a lot
2011-12-19T09:26:33  <antimatroid> so it's considering moves from the enemies with higher priorities like maximising possible batle neighbours or whatever

2011-12-19T09:27:28  <besh> My bot has special code to keep an ant near hill and penilize careless bots like yours :)
2011-12-19T09:27:55  <antimatroid> it's usually pretty good with hill defense
2011-12-19T09:28:06  <antimatroid> it's just going to make stupid moves like that right at the last turn
2011-12-19T09:28:23  <besh> First strategy is see if my ant is closer to enemy hill than enemy ant.. if so move there immediately.. works pretty well.
2011-12-19T09:28:30  <flowenol> damn 2 timeouts in a row
2011-12-19T09:28:36  <rwest> hmmm rank 23
2011-12-19T09:28:39  <antimatroid> yeah i invade hills after battles

2011-12-19T09:45:01  <UncleVasya> I replaced it with considering these positions: 1. Standing  2. Minimizing distance to all my ants together   3. Minimizing distance to my ant (for every my ant).
2011-12-19T09:45:15  <moduspwned> so how does matching work, some people still ahve only 2 games but others have 4
2011-12-19T09:45:20  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: minimax?
2011-12-19T09:45:30  <Fluxid> bah i don't have account on forum
2011-12-19T09:45:32  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: did you do "neutral offensive"?
2011-12-19T09:45:41  <UncleVasya> So I consider for enemy is about 1 + 1 + my_ants_num * 1.2  moves
2011-12-19T09:45:48  <UncleVasya> *- is
2011-12-19T09:45:50  <antimatroid> ie. don't move into a square that's currently battleable by an enemy, otherwise get close to tehm
2011-12-19T09:46:04  <rwest> my combat is so simple
2011-12-19T09:46:26  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: yes, minimax and yes, I have this thing (call it positional or tactical score)
2011-12-19T09:46:30  <smiley1983> antimatroid: yes, it's very hard to have accurate knowledge of what some functions are going to be used for until after they're written.
2011-12-19T09:46:30  <rwest> it's similar to memetix, but simpler (worse performing, but whatever)

2011-12-19T09:47:42  <antimatroid> ie. I used to pick my move and their moves then run minimax, but now i pick my moves, then each time i make my moves i then pick their moves in response and evaluate that

2011-12-19T09:50:03  <antimatroid> 'bestWorstOutcome < currentOutcome' could really be 'bestWorstOutcome <= currentOutcome', but that meant also overloading <= :P

2011-12-19T09:53:31  <smiley1983> there are a few things in place which try to nudge them toward that goal, but I was never very happy with it, and thought it could have done it much better with more work

2011-12-19T09:55:02  <mcstar> i wonder where my bot ends up
2011-12-19T09:55:03  <smiley1983> besh: basically, the ants want to be the same distance from the enemy as their nearby friends. They prefer not to advance ahead of their friends toward an enemy they can see.
2011-12-19T09:55:04  <antimatroid> i just move ants to the battle border
2011-12-19T09:55:10  <mcstar> its too simple to describe
2011-12-19T09:55:17  <mcstar> im not sure i want to

2011-12-19T09:55:34  <antimatroid> smiley1983: wouldn't it be better to get your leading ants there to slow them down if possible?
2011-12-19T09:55:43  <antimatroid> i just get ants to the battle border and wait for backup if needed

2011-12-19T09:56:25  <antimatroid> what i don't do right is i walk ants from the back around to the open battle border
2011-12-19T09:56:37  <antimatroid> rather than sort of walking them directly in and moving the battle ants over
2011-12-19T09:56:44  <Fluxid> hom some of the bots already have 4 games while other still 2?
2011-12-19T09:56:44  <antimatroid> at least i don't think i do that right

2011-12-19T09:58:56  <UncleVasya> thanks
2011-12-19T09:59:06  <antimatroid> that's an open problem to any of you
2011-12-19T09:59:19  <avdg> I wonder how that guy passed the test
2011-12-19T09:59:21  <antimatroid> a single bfs from the *'s, move all 'a's towards them optimally
2011-12-19T09:59:27  <Fluxid> i did some notes on paper... but then drawed over drawings and wrote some text over it so it's unreadable right now
2011-12-19T09:59:29  <mcstar> UncleVasya: what editor did you use?

2011-12-19T10:00:58  <UncleVasya> yes.  Edit --> Press Button Execute --> launch in AntsTesting
2011-12-19T10:01:02  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=274672 buhito kills ants surprisingly easily
2011-12-19T10:01:18  <antimatroid> smiley1983: yeah, ie. bottom right 'a' needs to walk around the line, an ant in line needs to step out of line for a trapped 'a', and you can't just not search over taken locs because the 'a' with a gap needs to move south (and not possibly east)
2011-12-19T10:02:27  <smiley1983> I know that my bot does not solve this optimally. If an optimal solution is needed, I would need to think a lot and probably fail without research.
2011-12-19T10:02:44  <antimatroid> i'm just curious in general now
2011-12-19T10:02:48  <Fluxid> a1k0n: #ifdef BLAH

2011-12-19T10:03:00  <antimatroid> i would be very keen to see anything anyone comes up with to correctly handle that test case
2011-12-19T10:03:08  <rwest> antimatroid: my bot wouldn't line up, problem solved
2011-12-19T10:03:36  <antimatroid> what if your hill is in a little hook on the map?
2011-12-19T10:03:45  <antimatroid> which twists around to get our and you have a lot of ants?
2011-12-19T10:03:47  <rwest> they would spread the line out to be even
2011-12-19T10:03:58  <antimatroid> then you're searching over suboptimal paths
2011-12-19T10:04:09  <rwest> I use an influence map, being behind another ant lessens scent of objects
2011-12-19T10:04:13  <antimatroid> i'm trying to get the flow going somewhat optimally
2011-12-19T10:04:29  <retybok> Has someone made a list of bot sources that are available? Something where people could add their own would probably be useful

2011-12-19T10:06:54  <tmseiler> is the tcp server source hanging around somewhere?
2011-12-19T10:07:05  <smiley1983> antimatroid: actually, my bot would get part of this test case correct, but probably not all of it. All ants set signal their desired moves, and then if there is a conflict, it checks the alternatives for all of them; the one with the worst alternative takes the fought-over move while the others take alternatives.
2011-12-19T10:07:09  <rwest> retybok: good idea, I will add a link to my profile

2011-12-19T10:12:37  <smiley1983> it does try to avoid traffic jams by marking blockades and directing its beacon-pathfinding to go around

2011-12-19T10:13:52  <antimatroid> rather than just suboptimally moving them if possible

2011-12-19T10:14:40  <antimatroid> tmseiler:  i make very specific test cases (like the one before) then make sure my bot handles them how i want
2011-12-19T10:14:58  <antimatroid> then i play tcp games and look for stupid behaviour to correct or ideas for further strategies
2011-12-19T10:15:08  <GreenTea> Durendal, yes, i will put link to sources in my bots profile
2011-12-19T10:15:08  <tmseiler> yeah, I studied losses A LOT
2011-12-19T10:15:29  <tmseiler> I focused probably 80% of my energy on "big picture" stuff, and about 20% on combat tactics

2011-12-19T10:20:30  <antimatroid> and it uses unordered_set, so you need to compile with the +0x flag or whatever it is

2011-12-19T10:33:18  <mcstar> now more like 1000ms

2011-12-19T10:58:45  <pairofdice> 2 hours between games for me
2011-12-19T10:58:53  <codetiger> my profiles shows 3hours for next game. and it has only played 2 games
2011-12-19T10:59:04  <codetiger> :( does the timer work right?
2011-12-19T10:59:11  <pairofdice> No
2011-12-19T10:59:17  <mcstar> Next game should be within 3221 minutes.
2011-12-19T10:59:22  <mcstar> im not disappointed
2011-12-19T10:59:25  <mcstar> it lies to you
2011-12-19T10:59:31  <avdg> 1011 minutes
2011-12-19T10:59:43  <mcstar> and you get surprised when you actually get a game
2011-12-19T10:59:44  <codetiger> thanks for info... :P
2011-12-19T10:59:44  <avdg> (from 1388)
2011-12-19T10:59:45  <mcstar> so its nice
2011-12-19T10:59:51  <mcstar> its christmas anyway
2011-12-19T11:00:13  <pairofdice> :)
2011-12-19T11:00:28  <avdg> 953 atm
2011-12-19T11:00:54  <avdg> almost 900, hmm
2011-12-19T11:00:59  <avdg> I don't know what to say
2011-12-19T11:01:40  <Fluxid> games are shorter, game rate higher but waiting time definetely longer
2011-12-19T11:02:05  <Fluxid> starter bots y u upload
2011-12-19T11:02:48  <smiley1983> It means that everyone who improved their bot at all will beat half the pack or more :)
2011-12-19T11:03:16  <kost_> for sure
2011-12-19T11:03:27  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: Do you think your ants bot stronger then PW one?
2011-12-19T11:04:08  <antimatroid> i hope it's not better than mine
2011-12-19T11:04:10  <mcstar> ok, im convinced i will end up in the top x
2011-12-19T11:04:15  <antimatroid> i can't give up my claim of first in aus :P

2011-12-19T11:04:27  <codetiger> may be they should have checked hash of the uploaded file to check if its any of the starterbot. They would have halfed the server expense
2011-12-19T11:04:52  <antimatroid> codetiger; they'll stop getting games soon enough
2011-12-19T11:05:21  <codetiger> just a tip, am happy to wait
2011-12-19T11:05:26  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: I think I've organized my thoughts better, and produced more flexible, manageable code. I hope it finishes on a higher percentile :)
2011-12-19T11:05:34  <Speedy_Consoles> yay
2011-12-19T11:05:37  <Speedy_Consoles> im rank 4 :)
2011-12-19T11:05:45  <Speedy_Consoles> 3rd game :)
2011-12-19T11:06:08  <avdg> lol
2011-12-19T11:06:45  <UncleVasya> Now, looking back at the dev-process this time, I think with c++ I'd not be able to make it so strong.
2011-12-19T11:07:14  <avdg> well, I definitely have to learn more about c++ myself
2011-12-19T11:07:46  <antimatroid> pretty sure i still learn something new about c++ every time i do something
2011-12-19T11:08:11  <Anilm3> UncleVasya: Since C++ is turing-complete, whatever you did on any other language could be done on C++
2011-12-19T11:08:22  <pairofdice> That's not the issue
2011-12-19T11:08:26  <Anilm3> :D
2011-12-19T11:08:42  <Anilm3> I don't see any issue at all
2011-12-19T11:08:48  <avdg> imo other language, other programming style, even when you can write the same code

2011-12-19T11:13:16  <Anilm3> yeah, actual rankings aren't really meaningful
2011-12-19T11:13:26  <Anilm3> the battles are quite random
2011-12-19T11:13:33  <ChrisH_> yeah, just bad luck for my first couple games
2011-12-19T11:13:42  <ChrisH_> in terms of matchups that is
2011-12-19T11:14:00  <ChrisH_> against low players, so a win hasn't boosted my score much
2011-12-19T11:14:14  <rwest> idea for next challenge: scrabble

2011-12-19T11:14:52  <Accoun> not
2011-12-19T11:15:26  <Fluxid> rwest: not very hard challenge
2011-12-19T11:15:47  <pairofdice> scrabble as the next challenge would be the death of many kittens
2011-12-19T11:15:49  <Fluxid> just brute force stuff and you're done
2011-12-19T11:15:51  <rwest> Fluxid: there are more aspects to a game of scrabble than you might think

2011-12-19T11:17:11  <Fluxid> but even not hard, not actually exciting i think ;P
2011-12-19T11:17:30  <antimatroid> it needs to be exciting to watch
2011-12-19T11:17:34  <rwest> true
2011-12-19T11:17:40  <antimatroid> scrabble would be about as boring as dots and boxes
2011-12-19T11:17:53  <rwest> that is very true, would be boring as all hell haha

2011-12-19T11:34:08  <antimatroid> it would be interesting to take n bots of different skill, run a tournament with each bot in it twice separately and compare the results
2011-12-19T11:34:19  <antimatroid> ie. are the identical bots ranked identally/adjacently
2011-12-19T11:34:25  <antimatroid> identically*

2011-12-19T11:52:40  <boroda_> Yes, I know. We worked almost 16 hours before submission... but it was too late... finally we've submit stable version that was 4 versions before current one.

2011-12-19T12:58:19  <Elderwolf> rwest: There should be a horrible penalty for timeout/crash
2011-12-19T12:58:34  <Scryer> 2-player games give you smaller rewards than n-player games for large n.
2011-12-19T12:58:39  <Elderwolf> rwest: sometimes it's your best defense, because you got enough score in x rounds, and now enemy has to crush your 100 ants to get to your hill

2011-12-19T13:36:14  <antimatroid> but when i picked moves for the enemies i didn't put the preference of walking onto my hills high enough
2011-12-19T13:36:21  <antimatroid> stupid, stupid mistake, but it's done now
2011-12-19T13:36:32  <antimatroid> i'm hoping it wont be much of an issue

2011-12-19T13:37:08  <thestinger> so my bot sometimes backs away from my own hills and lets the enemy take it
2011-12-19T13:37:16  <UncleVasya> for <5 I examine all enemy moves.

2011-12-19T13:43:40  <xathis> McLeopold: why is it that 1/2 of the random_walks are 2-player maps? especially the open random_walks with only one hill per player remind me of beta-phase games

2011-12-19T13:48:24  <UncleVasya> it is because antimatroids work with multiply enemies in bot is buggy...
2011-12-19T13:48:39  <antimatroid> although if there was enough consensus i certainly wouldn't mind, but i think janzert would be opposed for good reasons

2011-12-19T13:49:29  <xathis> antimatroid: yeah, probably.
2011-12-19T13:49:32  <antimatroid> depends on who you ask I guess, reasons would usually be to do with influence on types of maps etc.

2011-12-19T13:53:11  <antimatroid> and BenJackson (i think) had a good point
2011-12-19T13:53:29  <antimatroid> you could potentially hurt yourself by weakening the enemies enemies neighbours
2011-12-19T13:53:33  <avdg> greentea: do you record dead ants with that?

2011-12-19T14:02:54  <Scryer> Is the forum down until people go away or it gets more resources?
2011-12-19T14:03:03  <antimatroid> in battle situations, i don't move one of their ants onto my hills with highest priority
2011-12-19T14:03:19  <antimatroid> so it sometimes doesn't check that, and lets them walk straight onto the hill
2011-12-19T14:03:44  <antimatroid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=277212&user=98
2011-12-19T14:03:45  <Scryer> That may not always be optimal. :)
2011-12-19T14:03:47  <antimatroid> happens in that game
2011-12-19T14:03:51  <GreenTea> omg)
2011-12-19T14:04:20  <antimatroid> GreenTea: it will usually get it i think, it just wont always get it, and it's only on the turn where they may walk onto it and i can save it
2011-12-19T14:04:34  <antimatroid> so it's not a HUGE bug, but enough to piss me off all the same :)
2011-12-19T14:05:10  <antimatroid> i have pretty decent defense otherwise (although I don't push ants away with such high priority as i used to)
2011-12-19T14:06:03  <GreenTea> don't see bug.

2011-12-19T14:56:14  <BenJackson> bearoff: what does the PHP field look like?
2011-12-19T14:56:19  <avdg> sorted by mu, I think I should actually hope for the top 5, because I would be already in the top 10

2011-12-19T14:57:48  <BenJackson> bearoff: just wondering if you were watching the PHP entries in general
2011-12-19T14:57:54  <BenJackson> as an unusual language
2011-12-19T14:58:03  <Zaphus> wow - the # games played is all over the place now, ranging from 3-9 just in the top 100.  I wasn't expecting it to be done like that, thought it would be more even
2011-12-19T14:58:06  <bearoff> my bot is PHP and I think it will be 1 of the PHP
2011-12-19T14:58:06  * avdg tried to avoid php in the last months
2011-12-19T14:58:24  * avdg now tries to avoid js
2011-12-19T14:58:27  <BenJackson> Zaphus: they cut over to skill scheduling
2011-12-19T14:58:29  <thestinger> BenJackson: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=281352&user=2255 I think my last-minute line formation change sort of works :)
2011-12-19T14:58:31  <avdg> too addicting
2011-12-19T14:58:34  <BenJackson> so the old bursty game thing is in effect
2011-12-19T14:58:54  <thestinger> hard to tell because I got a lot of ants, so my combat was basically trading 1 for 1 on purpose
2011-12-19T14:59:04  <BenJackson> thestinger: what is this "strcat" with no suffix
2011-12-19T14:59:08  <Zaphus> Benjackson: sigh :-(    they should have at least waited until everyone had 4 games
2011-12-19T14:59:12  <BenJackson> how can I anticipate its behavior?
2011-12-19T14:59:16  <thestinger> lol
2011-12-19T14:59:49  <BenJackson> thestinger: that's a ton of suiciding
2011-12-19T14:59:54  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-19T14:59:54  <BenJackson> you must rely a lot on your enemies to avoid you
2011-12-19T15:00:03  <thestinger> well, near the end most of the map is visible
2011-12-19T15:00:24  <BenJackson> I saw xathis doing that too, I wonder if it's not a strategy but just an over-adaptation to strong bots
2011-12-19T15:00:25  <thestinger> so my combat is basically willing to trade 3 of my ants for 1 of the enemy
2011-12-19T15:00:42  <BenJackson> I never got to anything like that
2011-12-19T15:00:42  <thestinger> at the start there isn't as much
2011-12-19T15:00:52  <BenJackson> (estimating total enemy strength)
2011-12-19T15:01:05  <thestinger> when I can see most of the map (75%+) I just assume I have a good idea about the number of enemies
2011-12-19T15:01:16  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=53 :D
2011-12-19T15:01:20  <thestinger> so if you hide in a corner and ambush me I'll be screwed :)
2011-12-19T15:01:54  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  pity your matches are so small, not getting many points so far
2011-12-19T15:02:18  <BenJackson> thestinger: so I should fast expand, detect that it's you, fold myself back into a solid square of ants
2011-12-19T15:02:21  <BenJackson> and wait for your arrival

2011-12-19T15:03:23  <thestinger> BenJackson: well, once I see your square it goes back to cautious mode
2011-12-19T15:03:38  <BenJackson> thestinger: too late, by then I've seen it all.  I've seen everything.

2011-12-19T15:04:26  <conor_f> 8 games :)
2011-12-19T15:04:35  <conor_f> even though I killed myself in the last one :/
2011-12-19T15:04:39  <thestinger> the 75% visible and twice as many ants as the enemy rule kicks in fairly soon in that game
2011-12-19T15:04:48  <thestinger> it was an early way to deal with stalemates
2011-12-19T15:04:53  <Zaphus> have any of the top contenders lost a game yet ?

2011-12-19T15:11:58  <thestinger> BenJackson: oh, figured it out
2011-12-19T15:12:12  <grokodile> surprising play from sevus in that game, very defensive, and seems to be in slo-mo!

2011-12-19T15:13:09  <conor_f> yeah, thought so :/ ty
2011-12-19T15:13:30  <conor_f> wow, games are being played a lot quicker now then before!
2011-12-19T15:13:36  <thestinger> BenJackson: oh, it works in the web console but not the address bar
2011-12-19T15:14:04  <thestinger> firefox menu -> web developer -> web console
2011-12-19T15:14:08  <thestinger> and then $("body").css("-moz-transform", "rotate(180deg)");
2011-12-19T15:14:12  <BenJackson> conor_f: you can click through from your page to an opponent like anaonymousx (you came in 2nd to him) and see his last pre-reset game he was #1017
2011-12-19T15:14:19  <thestinger> too lazy to figure out the id for the canvas :)
2011-12-19T15:14:20  <Zaphus> best way to see if you have had any tough opponents:  click on their name, scroll down to before the reset and see if they had any rankings of 80+ - those were all in the top 100
2011-12-19T15:14:25  <Murashka> conor_f because of stupid bots not plays with each over for 1000 turns?

2011-12-19T15:15:21  <BenJackson> avdg: probably similar, he's mostly relying on jquery being used by the page

2011-12-19T15:31:46  <Zaphus> Fluxid: you need to be able to quickly describe the gameplay mechanics to anyone, that looks complex.   Ants was simple - move your ants one of four directions, grab food, fight.
2011-12-19T15:31:48  <thestinger> "recursion" is good too :)

2011-12-19T15:32:46  <BenJackson> so part of that is balancing everyone's games
2011-12-19T15:32:48  <BenJackson> but it gets lumpy

2011-12-19T15:33:12  <rwest> I like the idea of a simplified RTS like ants

2011-12-19T15:33:47  <conor_f> rwest: yeah, same here
2011-12-19T15:33:55  <UncleVasya> or something like this

2011-12-19T15:44:32  <pairofdice> explosions are engaging
2011-12-19T15:44:40  <pairofdice> And bullets and guns

2011-12-19T15:53:00  <Scryer> The "imperfect information" aspect is also useful to slow down the minimaxers.
2011-12-19T15:53:03  <conor_f> something with lots of movement
2011-12-19T15:53:12  <Fluxid> damn, second game is even more complicated...
2011-12-19T15:53:21  <yoden> yeah, this is like the most interesting of the challenges by far
2011-12-19T15:53:24  <yoden> which is why i had to try :D
2011-12-19T15:54:25  <Murashka> first ranking page becomes more and more usual...
2011-12-19T15:54:35  <besh> i spent half of my aichallenge time dealing with the fact that I can not use tree search :(
2011-12-19T15:54:38  <Fluxid> oh hey, wikipedia has it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Soccer
2011-12-19T15:54:42  <bugnuts> I would love to see something with a cooperate/defect mechanism.
2011-12-19T15:54:48  <conor_f> Fluxid: problem solved :D
2011-12-19T15:55:04  <besh> picking up from starter packs also limits you if you are lazy like me.
2011-12-19T15:55:40  <thestinger> the xpilot idea was pretty cool, I can't find that forum post for some reason
2011-12-19T15:55:51  <bugnuts> eg ants where per turn you could choose allies/enemies and for any pair of players who both choose to be allies there is no combat.
2011-12-19T15:55:52  <BenJackson> asteroids
2011-12-19T15:56:04  <Fluxid> "In Poland, the game is popular among school children and students." that explains it much...
2011-12-19T15:56:08  <BenJackson> thestinger: the physics knowledge to do anything in xpilot is pretty high though
2011-12-19T15:56:12  <thestinger> a sort of real-time game would be neat because there wouldn't be timeouts, just slow reactions to changes
2011-12-19T15:56:38  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, but it could be simplified more than the existing game
2011-12-19T15:57:15  <besh> fluxid: not thorough enough. Your post is better.
2011-12-19T15:57:22  <Fluxid> i don't like the fact that there are lots of physics in xfire to simulate ;(
2011-12-19T15:58:19  <yoden> a way to remove timeouts would be sweet... but real time games are much more complicated I think...
2011-12-19T15:58:44  <conor_f> :/ major fail with my bot and environments without a lot of food :/
2011-12-19T15:58:46  <besh> bugnuts: that is why I was expecting from ants but turns out it doesn't give you enough information to collude with others.

2011-12-19T16:02:46  <thestinger> imo, the starter bots should be cut off sooner rather than later, then people who actually coded something (lets say rank 4000 and higher) can play more games

2011-12-19T16:03:08  <Scryer> Perhaps they're seeing how it goes so they can make mid-course corrections. If they post an explicit plan, then changing it with changing information becomes problematical.

2011-12-19T16:04:49  <BenJackson> but it could be the Zaphus bug again
2011-12-19T16:04:52  <Westicles> Ah
2011-12-19T16:05:02  <BenJackson> @later tell janzert that Zaphus bug may be back?                     http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=3166

2011-12-19T16:05:46  <janzert> BenJackson: yeah, we're working on it now
2011-12-19T16:05:47  <BenJackson> at work some OTHER guy named Jackson did something ... questionable so they named the idea the "jackson ____"
2011-12-19T16:05:54  <conor_f> the sigma has gone up because it timeouts against weak bots so its unsure of its rank....
2011-12-19T16:05:56  <janzert> why games aren't running again :(

2011-12-19T16:56:54  <tob__k> another question: I noticed that some bots have had 13 games in the finals so far, and others (including mine...) only four. Is this just a coincidence?
2011-12-19T16:58:03  <janzert> tob_k: basically due to the way trueskill match making works, it should even back out over the day

2011-12-19T17:01:05  <flowenol> aka 00 GMT
2011-12-19T17:01:13  <BenJackson> we need a new countdown!
2011-12-19T17:01:13  <ikaros> quite short for the games per minute rate
2011-12-19T17:01:17  <ChrisH_> I find it interesting that this game with a couple of pretty good bots ended in a complete stalemate with none of the bots doing a very good job (IMHO) navigating the maze.  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=281406
2011-12-19T17:01:20  <Equinoxe> Hello all ! The servers look offline, will the end-of-finals date be extended ?
2011-12-19T17:01:22  <janzert> if we have to we may be able to extend them a bit although that pushes it into Christmas :(
2011-12-19T17:01:40  <tob__k> Right, didn't notice the announcement. Thanks!
2011-12-19T17:01:48  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I think we saw delineate basically go haywire ont hat map earlier
2011-12-19T17:01:53  <BenJackson> oh that's it
2011-12-19T17:02:00  <flowenol> janzert I already considered the time a little short considering the game rate
2011-12-19T17:02:02  <Equinoxe> "Workers are offline", from the server statistics ;)
2011-12-19T17:02:15  <BenJackson> flowenol: games are stopped for maintenance

2011-12-19T17:04:45  <ChrisH_> pairofdice: yes, which means they will probably need to be pretty aggressive cutoffs.
2011-12-19T17:05:11  <ikaros> which means there need to be alot more games to be played before cutoffs :O
2011-12-19T17:05:11  <flowenol> just dont cut me my first place in portugal :D
2011-12-19T17:05:37  <Equinoxe> BenJackson> Quite embarrassing ...
2011-12-19T17:05:42  <flowenol> damn i have a bet on that
2011-12-19T17:06:04  <tob__k> Another thing I noticed during my games. I do not want to complain, but maybe this is a problem with the matchmaking algorithm. In my third game, I had a rank of around 1000 and played against a number of bots of ranks around 7000, which seemed quite odd...

2011-12-19T17:10:00  <Cowbandit> lol ya I agree. I just like how they use "a while" to describe indefinite amounts of time

2011-12-19T17:13:35  <xathis> it will take a while until the ranking is back to normal, i hope you're all using the time to write about your strategy and your bot implementation ;)
2011-12-19T17:13:57  <ChrisH_> xathis got robbed with the pairings in his last game, four opponents with mu nearly 30 points below his

2011-12-19T17:51:54  <Cowbandit> avdg: I kind of wish I took that route because for the past two weeks i've pretty much plateaued and used up all my time on my bot with no results :P
2011-12-19T17:52:35  <avdg> me too, but I had a full time job handling my parents as well (so it added more frustrations)
2011-12-19T17:52:45  <tob__k> luckily i learned of this AI challenge (or remembered last years challenge) only about 10 days ago, so not too much time was 'wasted' :-)
2011-12-19T17:53:05  <tob__k> last year, I was 'out of business' for weeks...
2011-12-19T17:53:06  <avdg> tob_k: lets say lost ;-)

2011-12-19T17:55:49  <Cowbandit> my combat was just me positioning the ants so they were equidistant from the enemy and then running A* on the enemy

2011-12-19T17:56:51  <tob__k> i calculate a 'kill quote' for my fighter-ants, being (#killed ants) if the ant itself is not killed, and -1/(# killed ants) otherwise
2011-12-19T17:57:35  <tob__k> the tricky part was making the ants neither to suicidal not to shy...
2011-12-19T17:57:40  <avdg> janzert: you should learn to use php -l ;-) (php lint)
2011-12-19T17:58:22  <tob__k> one of my later bots was not bad, but stopped short of all ant-hills with a single, stationary defender on top of it... looked quite ridiculous, 30 ants standing in a circle around a single defender. :-D

2011-12-19T18:31:57  <Wraithan> I wont be in the top 100, but my friends and I are still competing amongst ourselves so I made a simple command that pulls down our 3 stats and greedy bot as a measuring stick to see how we were doing

2011-12-19T18:45:36  <Kettling> I have a feeling that the match-ups are designed to accurately identify who should get booted in the first cut, rather than to accurately identify anything near the top
2011-12-19T18:45:39  <avdg> hmm, so the number of colored donuts is not the objective?
2011-12-19T18:45:55  <Kettling> Lots of the matches are ending with "food not being gathered"

2011-12-19T18:52:26  <Extrarius> I'd like to see an AI challenge where planning played a bigger part than graph searches
2011-12-19T18:54:02  <Equinoxe> Prologin 2010 was like that, but it was an on-site competition in paris, so ...
2011-12-19T18:54:05  <thestinger> http://queue.acm.org/icpc/game_description/environment.cfm oh
2011-12-19T18:54:10  <thestinger> they do have info up
2011-12-19T18:54:15  <Scryer> Is that ACM thing Java only?
2011-12-19T18:54:20  <thestinger> for some reason I didn't see it :P
2011-12-19T18:54:29  <tmseiler> hi
2011-12-19T18:54:30  <thestinger> ewwwww gcc 4.1.2
2011-12-19T18:54:33  <thestinger> wtf.
2011-12-19T18:54:37  <pairofdice> Their website is confusing
2011-12-19T18:54:39  <Equinoxe> Scryer: It also allowed C++, C and C#, I think
2011-12-19T18:55:02  <thestinger> yeah, the page I linked has info on it
2011-12-19T18:55:03  <Extrarius> any ideas on what game attributes would make planning more important and graph searching less so?
2011-12-19T18:55:41  <Equinoxe> A continuous plane, maybe ?
2011-12-19T18:55:45  <yoden> the biggest part of this challenge wasn't planning or graph search
2011-12-19T18:55:47  <yoden> it was combat :D
2011-12-19T18:55:53  <Equinoxe> Graph searching immediately becomes harder
2011-12-19T18:55:56  <Extrarius> I'm thinking a large enough state space would make exhaustive searching unuseful
2011-12-19T18:56:24  <yoden> i thought this went pretty well... for a while you could get a top 100 bot with just graph search
2011-12-19T18:56:33  <yoden> but by the end, it's hard to make top 500 like that :D
2011-12-19T18:56:37  <Extrarius> yoden: you could handle combat as min/max which is just searching the state space
2011-12-19T18:56:56  <yoden> eh, i don't think most top bots do minimax
2011-12-19T18:57:07  <yoden> at least, several have stated they don't
2011-12-19T18:57:07  <Equinoxe> Extrarius: I believe that min-max is too time-greedy =/

2011-12-19T18:59:53  <Extrarius> any tcp servers still up?
2011-12-19T19:00:00  <flowenol> Still a lot
2011-12-19T19:00:05  <Cowbandit> Extrarius: ouch lol. I wonder if the admins can let you resubmit your code
2011-12-19T19:00:13  <tmseiler> the number is plummeting faster than it actually indicates
2011-12-19T19:00:14  <flowenol> And the servers seem back up
2011-12-19T19:00:33  <tmseiler> it'll probably be accurate after your next game
2011-12-19T19:00:34  <Extrarius> Cowbandit: That is my best effort. I moved right after I found out about the contest so I didn't have enough time
2011-12-19T19:00:43  <flowenol> Hope so

2011-12-19T20:16:06  <avdg> thestinger: then use a dialog with 2 buttons with the same action (to join irc) :p
2011-12-19T20:16:43  <avdg> "would you like to join irc" [ yes | no ]
2011-12-19T20:16:54  <thestinger> you don't even need the 'no' button
2011-12-19T20:16:59  <pairofdice> Or just one option, yes
2011-12-19T20:17:03  <pairofdice> haha
2011-12-19T20:17:10  <thestinger> "you are going to join irc [ okay ]"
2011-12-19T20:17:17  <avdg> oh, we want to give the users a choice :p
2011-12-19T20:17:29  <thestinger> choice would just confuse people
2011-12-19T20:17:53  <avdg> not if they think they control the choices
2011-12-19T20:18:04  <avdg> kinda facebook-thing

2011-12-19T20:18:17  <thestinger> but it joins anyway? :P
2011-12-19T20:18:28  <Wraithan> Meh, IRC has a high enough barrier to entry that it filters morons out.
2011-12-19T20:18:51  <Wraithan> Not all of the morons, just a decent portion of them

2011-12-19T21:25:23  <ChrisH_> amstan: I'm sure you already realize this, and I definitely appreciate all the hard work that you and the other organizers are doing to run this contest, but the communication gap with the general populice has created a situation where people don't know what to expect for how the finals will play out, there isn't a good resource describing it to point them too, and they are frustrated by the general lack of responses from anyone
2011-12-19T21:25:46  <ChrisH_> amstan: you are the most responsive on the forums, but more would help i think
2011-12-19T21:26:01  <amstan> ChrisH_: well.. for the most day today mcleopold and janzert coded hard fixing an elusive bug
2011-12-19T21:26:02  <avdg> I don't know how nice it would be to have a rank table, see https://gist.github.com/1499940 and http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=2161&start=30

2011-12-19T21:26:28  <amstan> for what?
2011-12-19T21:27:39  <ChrisH_> i think a lot of people are frustrated by the imbalance in number of games because they don't know how the system is designed to work so their expectations are for equal games for everyone
2011-12-19T21:27:42  * avdg didn't mention bonus points for getting the list sorted as well
2011-12-19T21:27:58  <amstan> ChrisH_: where? there was one post about that, where i tried to reply my best
2011-12-19T21:28:05  <ChrisH_> amstan: they also seem to be generally unaware of how the cutoff system is going to work, so they complain about all the starter bots. etc.
2011-12-19T21:28:42  <amstan> ChrisH_: i don't know myself actually, it was just a scheduled thing
2011-12-19T21:30:08  <ChrisH_> amstan: I understand this is not trivial, I am just pointing out what is probably obvious:  more communication will help people understand and be less frustrated (hopefully)
2011-12-19T21:31:00  <ChrisH_> I think that in general people are surprised that the finals are not proceeding like they expected and the only reason for that is that they don't know what to expect
2011-12-19T21:31:18  <thestinger> it gave me another game :)

2011-12-19T21:34:04  <BenJackson> therefore I win

2011-12-19T21:39:54  <BenJackson> no?
2011-12-19T21:40:01  <BenJackson> sourceforge crapped out when I went to browse his code
2011-12-19T21:40:03  <thestinger> he "captures" your hill
2011-12-19T21:40:05  <thestinger> and holds it hostage
2011-12-19T21:40:07  <ChrisH_> amstan: that may be true, but many posters don't seem to understand how it works even now because it's never been described to them
2011-12-19T21:40:09  <thestinger> like he parks 2 ants next to it
2011-12-19T21:40:10  <BenJackson> ohh yeah
2011-12-19T21:40:13  <BenJackson> I still think that's wrong
2011-12-19T21:40:21  <thestinger> I love it xD, I wish I had thought of that
2011-12-19T21:40:25  <BenJackson> but then I managed to make my final submit ignore early unguarded hills altogether
2011-12-19T21:40:38  <amstan> ChrisH_: half of the posts are suggestions on how we should be disabling starter bots.
2011-12-19T21:40:39  <BenJackson> thestinger: I thought of it but decided it wasn't to my benefit
2011-12-19T21:40:41  <BenJackson> probably is on a 2p map
2011-12-19T21:40:51  <thestinger> BenJackson: wasting 2 ants doesn't seem that bad
2011-12-19T21:40:57  <amstan> ChrisH_: i just don't think it's important arguing with everyone on how we already have similar things that do the same thing
2011-12-19T21:41:03  <thestinger> one would be in the area to gather food anyway, so it's really like wasting one ant
2011-12-19T21:41:11  <BenJackson> amstan: I don't agree with disabling them now, but I would recommend not encouragign people to sign up and immediately re-up a starter kit
2011-12-19T21:41:18  <BenJackson> but maybe that did garner more participation
2011-12-19T21:41:19  <amstan> ChrisH_: and it most definatelly won't change the rankings of the people participating in the argument by discussing this
2011-12-19T21:41:32  <ChrisH_> amstan: so an explanation of how the cuttoff is going to work would help them realize that you already have a solution and they can be happy instead of frustrated that no-one seems to be listening to them.
2011-12-19T21:42:04  <ChrisH_> amstan: I'm not talking about rankings, I'm talking about public relations
2011-12-19T21:42:37  <amstan> it's kinda hard to do public relations when there's no PR employees for this
2011-12-19T21:43:35  <avdg> amstan: you're lucky to have ai-class this time ;-)
2011-12-19T21:43:55  <ChrisH_> amstan: ok, have it your way.
2011-12-19T21:43:57  <amstan> i spend my time making sure everything goes smoothly, i just don't see the point talking to people about how they think they should run the contest, and then expect me to relay all of these(possibly wrong) suggestions to janzert and mcleopold
2011-12-19T21:44:13  <amstan> avdg: why?
2011-12-19T21:44:20  <avdg> for the advertention
2011-12-19T21:44:30  <amstan> ChrisH_: i'm just a volunteer
2011-12-19T21:44:33  <amstan> ChrisH_: we all are
2011-12-19T21:44:36  <amstan> avdg: huh?
2011-12-19T21:44:40  <avdg> nvm
2011-12-19T21:44:53  <ChrisH_> amstan: I know, but you want the contest to be well received by the participants, right?
2011-12-19T21:45:11  <ChrisH_> amstan: and you put a lot of hard work into making it a cool and fun contest, right?
2011-12-19T21:45:27  <amstan> ChrisH_: sure.. but i'm getting nothing in return for this, except having something awesome at the end that people recognize
2011-12-19T21:45:36  <Kettling> Ahh well, I'll probably hang onto my position in the top 1000, but when I meet up with bots in the top 500 I'm always losing. Good close in battle formation makes such a huge difference.
2011-12-19T21:45:41  <ChrisH_> amstan: so it seems to me that part of that is making information about the contest easily available to the widest audience possible.
2011-12-19T21:45:41  <amstan> so there's no point for me to try pleasing everyone, i know that won't be possible
2011-12-19T21:46:07  <ChrisH_> amstan: and IRC is not how you do that
2011-12-19T21:46:29  <thestinger> the finals aren't really different than the regular rankings before though
2011-12-19T21:46:43  <ChrisH_> amstan: the forums and the website are the venue for 95% of the participants to get their info about the tournament

2011-12-19T21:48:34  <ChrisH_> amstan: you don't have to argue with them, just tell them how it will work
2011-12-19T21:49:16  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: did you see amstan's forum post where he explained how he won't be answering any more of your questions?
2011-12-19T21:49:19  <BenJackson> I thought it was very clear
2011-12-19T21:49:23  <avdg> we should probably add a pointer (to the forum for example)
2011-12-19T21:49:29  <amstan> BenJackson: what?
2011-12-19T21:49:42  <BenJackson> amstan: sorry, our senses of humor are totally incompatible
2011-12-19T21:49:42  <amstan> ChrisH_: how would you 'answer' this then? http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2056
2011-12-19T21:49:44  <BenJackson> but I'm joking
2011-12-19T21:49:56  <amstan> BenJackson: heheh
2011-12-19T21:50:11  <ChrisH_> amstan: anyway, i'm not here to pick a fight

2011-12-19T21:50:43  <thestinger> http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=2170#p13331 I think this was fine, it's in the sticky
2011-12-19T21:50:57  <amstan> ChrisH_: so what's wrong with your answer then? why can't contestants use that answer instead of mine?
2011-12-19T21:51:14  <BenJackson> can you make ChrisH_'s name red?
2011-12-19T21:51:26  <amstan> ChrisH_: it's a forum, a place where other people can reply, not just organizers
2011-12-19T21:51:38  <amstan> just because it's not red, it doesn't mean it's incorrect
2011-12-19T21:51:41  * avdg thinks at trust lvl
2011-12-19T21:51:47  <BenJackson> wow server stats still say "7 new users in last 24h"
2011-12-19T21:51:49  <BenJackson> someone cut it close
2011-12-19T21:51:56  <thestinger> <
2011-12-19T21:52:03  <amstan> BenJackson: might be duplicate accounts
2011-12-19T21:52:05  <BenJackson> 256 submits
2011-12-19T21:52:07  <BenJackson> but 7 new users
2011-12-19T21:52:10  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-19T21:52:12  <BenJackson> amstan: I thought those were illegal
2011-12-19T21:52:15  <amstan> yeah..
2011-12-19T21:52:20  * Speedy_Consoles wonders why avdg always uses 3rd person to chat
2011-12-19T21:52:21  <amstan> but good luck proving it
2011-12-19T21:52:24  <avdg> BenJackson: the numbers are from almost 24 hours ago
2011-12-19T21:52:26  <thestinger> antimatroid didn't submit until the last day iirc
2011-12-19T21:52:35  <ChrisH_> amstan: but as an organizer I would answer with a toned down version that says: "We believe multi-hill maps are valid maps that may require a different strategy that single hill maps and are included to encourage creative thinking"
2011-12-19T21:52:39  * avdg has communication problems ;-)
2011-12-19T21:52:47  * BenJackson guesses he's a mudder?
2011-12-19T21:52:51  <amstan> ChrisH_: yes, but i don't know that
2011-12-19T21:52:56  <amstan> ChrisH_: for a while, i agreed with them
2011-12-19T21:53:08  <amstan> mcleopold and janzert like them, so i'm gonna go with what they say
2011-12-19T21:53:48  <BenJackson> so who believes xathis when he claims that 1v1 is his weakness?
2011-12-19T21:54:03  <amstan> dakleb made his user at  11:53 before the submissions closed
2011-12-19T21:54:14  <thestinger> BenJackson: I think those tiny 1v1 maps are what makes him say that

2011-12-19T21:54:47  <thestinger> BenJackson: you don't have enough room to take advantage of good food gathering, territory control, etc.
2011-12-19T21:54:47  <ChrisH_> amstan: with regard to other people replying, they have no reason to believe that what I say has any weight with how the contest will be run or has any accuracy because me (or any other non-organizer that replies) don't have any "special knowledge"
2011-12-19T21:54:52  <thestinger> I think it applies to all the good bots
2011-12-19T21:55:38  <codetiger> 50 mins for game 5
2011-12-19T21:55:40  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=267984&user=3473 <- seemed pretty good to me
2011-12-19T21:55:50  <amstan> there's no such thing as special knowlege, the source code is open, bugs are openly discussed in places
2011-12-19T21:55:54  <BenJackson> although chrish can bring up the counterexample of him thrashing me on tutorial.map
2011-12-19T21:56:25  <amstan> only thing that's private is account issues, but there's very few of those
2011-12-19T21:56:30  <ChrisH_> amstan: like I said, i'm not here to pick a fight, it just seemed to me like the same questions keep coming up on the forums and having a central page or post to refer them to with the details about how the finals are expected to proceed would help you and others that might want to help handle the questions

2011-12-19T21:59:12  <amstan> issue is that we would like jeff's permission to do this, since he founded the contest

2011-12-19T22:15:00  <rwest_> same
2011-12-19T22:15:09  <thestinger> the game rate isn't bad but all the bots are playing now
2011-12-19T22:15:11  <avdg> mine didn't play for 6h8m
2011-12-19T22:15:20  <ChrisH_> amstan: Do you have any info why there are fewer workers running now than there were before finals?
2011-12-19T22:15:27  <rwest_> been 10 hrs
2011-12-19T22:15:31  <rwest_> waiting on 5th game
2011-12-19T22:15:32  <rwest_> lol
2011-12-19T22:16:18  <thestinger> ChrisH_: it actually slowed down a lot before the finals started
2011-12-19T22:16:21  <rwest_> I set up a nice script to email me every time my skill changes, and it hasn't done anything lol
2011-12-19T22:16:51  <avdg> how fast does it refresh :p
2011-12-19T22:16:53  <ChrisH_> thestinger: you mean, with more servers, or that we had fewer servers than I remember?
2011-12-19T22:16:58  <rwest_> avdg: 5 mins
2011-12-19T22:17:42  <thestinger> ChrisH_: game rate went down to 0, and then it didn't get up to the peak again
2011-12-19T22:17:55  <thestinger> maybe janzert knows :)
2011-12-19T22:18:27  <BenJackson> rwest_: I initially did what thestinger did and emailed rank changes
2011-12-19T22:18:29  <BenJackson> that was tooo much
2011-12-19T22:18:32  <BenJackson> so now it's skill changes
2011-12-19T22:18:43  <thestinger> I do pretty much the same (game_count) now
2011-12-19T22:18:51  <avdg> well, anyway, these admins deserves credits for fixing the servers, it must been a hard time
2011-12-19T22:18:55  <ChrisH_> thestinger: I'm not following you, before finals we were typically running 24 workers, now there are only 15. I expect the game rate per server to be better in finals because all the simple starter bots are active again
2011-12-19T22:18:57  *** TL_ <TL_!70c6400f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.112.198.64.15> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-19T22:19:36  <thestinger> ChrisH_: well, in the 2 days leading up to the final I think the game rate was really low (I might not be remembering correctly)
2011-12-19T22:20:45  <thestinger> when janzert is back he can probably tell you why
2011-12-19T22:20:46  <ChrisH_> thestinger: I think game rates for individuals dropped a bit because there were a bunch of resubmits that increased the pool of active bots from around 700 to closer to 900 or 1000 this past weekend
2011-12-19T22:21:07  <thestinger> I think the matchmaking couldn't keep up with the game rate, so maybe some of the workers were turned off
2011-12-19T22:21:29  <thestinger> the web server was getting really sluggish (due to the matchmaking), but it's fine now
2011-12-19T22:21:34  <ChrisH_> yes, i heard that, and I think that was because they were running with 24 workers

2011-12-19T22:22:36  <ChrisH_> so perhaps there are only 15 workers running now to keep the workload on the manager from getting too high, and that's sort of what I was asking if amstan knew anything about
2011-12-19T22:22:56  <thestinger> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/864c1c074df8b2abc53d9ae869d943158ddd387e#sql oh, there's the cutoff thing
2011-12-19T22:23:06  <amstan> ChrisH_: or perhaps they're just testing if their fixes work

2011-12-19T22:37:05  <avdg> nice
2011-12-19T22:37:43  <BenJackson> I thought the "AI" in ants was pretty clever but the rest I'm not so sure about
2011-12-19T22:38:12  <thestinger> now every time I get an email I think my bot played a game...
2011-12-19T22:38:23  <BenJackson> I must have played while posting that...
2011-12-19T22:38:33  <BenJackson> ah yes, but I only played 2 bots
2011-12-19T22:38:48  <thestinger> top 100 now
2011-12-19T22:38:58  <BenJackson> I was 20 at one point
2011-12-19T22:39:02  <BenJackson> drifted down to 212
2011-12-19T22:39:09  <BenJackson> so I doubt 75 will hold up long
2011-12-19T22:39:25  <thestinger> maybe it will give you 3 games in a row like it did for me
2011-12-19T22:39:35  <BenJackson> nhaehnle put up a fight there
2011-12-19T22:39:42  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2255 look at the times for the last 3
2011-12-19T22:39:54  <McLeopold> BenJackson: didn't see it at first, the AI
2011-12-19T22:40:12  <BenJackson> McLeopold: I didn't mention it to see if it's obvious enough
2011-12-19T22:40:18  <BenJackson> it's more obvious without the extra diagonal
2011-12-19T22:40:21  <BenJackson> but then it's *wrong* :)
2011-12-19T22:40:28  <thestinger> do you get pulled into more games when your sigma is low?
2011-12-19T22:40:48  <McLeopold> yes

2011-12-19T22:46:43  <thestinger> so I just left it alone
2011-12-19T22:46:45  <ChrisH_> right now having a low sigma really helps your ranking. there are several bots near the top with mu's that aren't great compared to other bots with fewer games
2011-12-19T22:47:02  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=282286&user=2255 <- nice work vs RVeerdonk
2011-12-19T22:47:03  <bmh> ChrisH_: I was just going to ask about that -- how long until things settle out?
2011-12-19T22:47:04  <ChrisH_> but that's expected
2011-12-19T22:47:20  <bmh> (cool, my server is still alive)
2011-12-19T22:47:36  <thestinger> BenJackson: my bot is good on those fairly open maps
2011-12-19T22:47:44  <ChrisH_> bmh: one of two things would have to happen, either we play a LOT more games, or we get the total games for each bot to be more equal
2011-12-19T22:47:51  <thestinger> the choke points in mazes + hills close together really screw me over
2011-12-19T22:48:06  <BenJackson> Migi32's defenders turn sideways like mine used to
2011-12-19T22:48:09  <rwest_> hills close together seems more random
2011-12-19T22:48:18  <rwest_> I either dominate or get dominated
2011-12-19T22:48:20  <ChrisH_> bmh: playing a lot of games will reduce the disparity between high and low, so it has a similar effect as bringing the low game bots up to par

2011-12-19T22:49:15  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, my last minute line formation code seemed to work well in that game
2011-12-19T22:49:37  <ChrisH_> bmh: I actually don't have a good feel for how many games we need to get things to settle down, but I think it is going to require some agressive cutoff settings to get the top bots the required game counts
2011-12-19T22:50:15  <BenJackson> with the deadline they set for sure
2011-12-19T22:50:22  * avdg wonders if there are still some good bots at the end of the rankings
2011-12-19T22:50:31  <McLeopold> no, there aren't
2011-12-19T22:50:37  <BenJackson> janzert: did you add code to stop bots at a certain game count prior to the cutoff or is that going to be fluid?
2011-12-19T22:50:38  <ChrisH_> the problem with finals is that *everyone* got reset, so now the rankings have to be completely regenerated, whereas before there were always a lot of stable bots to use as reference points
2011-12-19T22:50:43  <bmh> avdg: a1k0n is at 570
2011-12-19T22:51:02  <avdg> bmh: thats still relative good compared with the 8000 submissions
2011-12-19T22:51:11  <BenJackson> a1k0n only has 4 games still
2011-12-19T22:51:17  <McLeopold> I didn't find much besides starter bots past rank 1400

2011-12-19T22:51:36  <bmh> janzert: not to give you more work -- but have you pruned the starter bots?

2011-12-19T22:52:01  <rwest_> yea, i'm 546 with 4 games
2011-12-19T22:52:17  <McLeopold> doing the first cut is the first order of business
2011-12-19T22:52:23  <avdg> but at the same time, it got there after long waiting (from 1400)
2011-12-19T22:52:32  <rwest_> McLeopold: what is the first cut gonna be at?
2011-12-19T22:52:34  <bmh> McLeopold: can I disable/deactivate/kill my submission?
2011-12-19T22:52:45  <McLeopold> we haven't decided

2011-12-19T22:55:08  <thestinger> the maintainer of glibc in Arch (also maintains the rest of the toolchain) reported a glibc bug and it got closed for no reason

2011-12-19T22:55:24  <thestinger> with a comment telling him to get his distribution to build it for him (it was a bug in their build system)
2011-12-19T22:55:46  <thestinger> he even submitted a patch and a unit test
2011-12-19T22:55:58  <bugnuts> ChrisH_ earlier there was mention of the db not being able to cope with the insert rate
2011-12-19T22:56:17  <ChrisH_> bugnuts: I would believe that, do you know who said it?
2011-12-19T22:56:18  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: we had trueskill update issues
2011-12-19T22:56:31  <McLeopold> we put it at 15 to make sure stuff would work
2011-12-19T22:56:39  <McLeopold> we can turn it up after we do the first cutoff

2011-12-19T22:57:07  <bugnuts> thats as you start getting slower games from dropping starter bots?
2011-12-19T22:57:08  <McLeopold> basically, the backend code is crappy, and we didn't really test for this many users
2011-12-19T22:57:23  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: ok, that makes sense (assuming the update problems can't be fixed) because each game will take longer when better bots are mostly playing
2011-12-19T22:57:35  <McLeopold> the "influx" of many, many starter bots (which are fast and have fast games) caused race conditions
2011-12-19T22:57:56  <ChrisH_> ok, thanks for the update.
2011-12-19T22:58:14  <McLeopold> next time, we'll have a real web service, not php+mysql
2011-12-19T22:58:16  <ChrisH_> I suggest that someone post an explanation of this in the forums because I think a lot of people are curious what's been going on.
