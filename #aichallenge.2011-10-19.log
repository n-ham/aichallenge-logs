2011-10-19T00:17:56  <Alexei> but once you start and it becomes all logic/code and stradegy and debugging it gets interesting

2011-10-19T06:04:56  <mcstar> my answer was honest, really, with common lisp you can do that
2011-10-19T06:05:07  <mcstar> but i dont see what deos this mean in a c++ context

2011-10-19T06:10:28  <InsaneMalkavian> I mean how to make VS to run play-game.cmd which runs mybot.exe to debug it. Just like debugging dll.
2011-10-19T06:11:11  <mcstar> first of all, you have to disable timouts
2011-10-19T06:11:16  <mcstar> i did that first too

2011-10-19T06:11:46  <mcstar> after that, i guess msvs has a cli debugger, just like gdb
2011-10-19T06:11:53  <mcstar> run your exe through that
2011-10-19T06:13:28  <mcstar> engine.py line 331, last i checked
2011-10-19T06:13:44  <mcstar> comment out appropriately
2011-10-19T06:14:01  <mcstar> you need to do this, cause otherwise, the engine would kill your debugging session
2011-10-19T06:15:47  <mcstar> but i suspect this is going to be a PITA with MSVS, with lisp, i just run netcat with the engine, to which i connected from my running development environment, and could debug directly from slime/emacs

2011-10-19T06:16:12  <mcstar> its possible you are better off using sockets too, and running the exe from MSVS gui
2011-10-19T06:18:05  <mcstar> anyone knows why i have ground coffee in my tea?
2011-10-19T06:18:22  <delt0r_> mcstar: you can do that with java too... i suspect C# supports something like that as well
2011-10-19T06:18:40  <delt0r_> but really InsaneMalkavian good logging is typically enough
2011-10-19T06:18:50  <delt0r_> cout for the win ;)
2011-10-19T06:19:02  <mcstar> delt0r_: i suspect he really wants to use the debugger
2011-10-19T06:19:04  <delt0r_> well to the error stream of course
2011-10-19T06:19:09  <mcstar> cerr ftw
2011-10-19T06:19:27  <mcstar> poor man's debugger
2011-10-19T06:19:44  <delt0r_> simple verbose error steam output is highly underrated
2011-10-19T06:19:57  <delt0r_> but then a good debugger is gold too
2011-10-19T06:20:07  <Areks> Does anybody know how debug bot written on java?
2011-10-19T06:20:10  <mcstar> ive never used one, im inexperienced
2011-10-19T06:20:18  <delt0r_> I find with many threads debugers get pretty clusmy

2011-10-19T06:20:39  <Areks> )
2011-10-19T06:20:58  <Areks> um. what should i do?
2011-10-19T06:21:01  <delt0r_> Areks: there are lots of ways..  in particular to can attach to a JVM that is running in "debug" mode and grab stack traces etc
2011-10-19T06:21:28  <delt0r_> I would stat with a good IDE... eclipse/NetBeans/IDEA
2011-10-19T06:21:35  <delt0r_> the first two are free
2011-10-19T06:22:08  <delt0r_> then use the docs to run a debug session and will start to get a idea of what is involved.
2011-10-19T06:22:14  <Areks> I haw all of them ))
2011-10-19T06:22:19  <Areks> *have
2011-10-19T06:22:23  <delt0r_> i use eclipse

2011-10-19T06:27:23  <InsaneMalkavian> I use logging now, but sometimes it's not enough

2011-10-19T10:49:55  <mcstar> Posterdati: its your space/bandwidth/choice, suit yourself
2011-10-19T10:50:28  <amstan> mcstar: why do you think this is a problem?
2011-10-19T10:50:43  <mcstar> amstan: http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html
2011-10-19T10:50:55  <amstan> mcstar: you mean no windows support?
2011-10-19T10:50:58  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-19T10:51:12  <amstan> is there an alternative?
2011-10-19T10:51:18  <mcstar> i dont care about THAT, but i feel like theres a smaller chance that windows people will use lisp
2011-10-19T10:51:29  <mcstar> there is
2011-10-19T10:51:36  <mcstar> clozure cl, cmucl
2011-10-19T10:51:43  <amstan> does it run the starter package the same?
2011-10-19T10:52:06  <mcstar> i discussed with aerique, that he should change the implementation dependent part of it
2011-10-19T10:52:13  <mcstar> its 1 line, sort of
2011-10-19T10:52:28  <amstan> well, i'm sure you guys can solve it
2011-10-19T10:52:39  <mcstar> only if you want it
2011-10-19T10:52:55  <mcstar> it is not my problem per say

2011-10-19T11:09:44  <wastinger> Regarding ant spawing. Say, all ants are occupied and I gather further food. Afterwards the hills are emptied. Do ants spawn from the food I previously gathered or would I have lost the opportunity?

2011-10-19T11:15:13  <wastinger> amstan: Is food valid only for 1 turn? What if my hills are occupied. Can I still spawn ants using food gathered when my hills were all occupied?
2011-10-19T11:15:34  <InsaneMalkavian> yes
2011-10-19T11:16:11  <amstan> i think you can store ants in your hill
2011-10-19T11:16:18  <amstan> i saw a few games with that happening
2011-10-19T11:16:28  <InsaneMalkavian> I mean hill will spawn ant next turn. you wont lose gathered food.

I have heard rumors that they are going live any day now, so if you can't create an account today, check back tomorrow or the next day and maybe it will be open.

2011-10-19T14:31:24  <amstan> UncleVasya: i talked to InsaneMalkavian and he said you guys are writing a blog post about it
2011-10-19T14:31:47  <amstan> UncleVasya: so you'll have the privilege of knowing a few minutes before the time comes
2011-10-19T14:32:26  <amstan> but we'll do stuff from irc anyway, so people will know
2011-10-19T14:33:23  <testit> a month or so?
2011-10-19T14:33:23  <testit> how long will the contest last once open?
2011-10-19T14:33:30  <amstan> december
2011-10-19T14:34:02  <testit> and are we allowed to use 3rdparty open source libs in our bots? (by adding their source code to the zip?)
2011-10-19T14:34:16  <amstan> testit: yep, as long as it compiles
2011-10-19T14:34:39  <amstan> testit: you can't use makefiles, so that might be a problem
2011-10-19T14:34:45  <testit> cool, will take a bit of build hacking but should be workable
2011-10-19T14:34:47  <cirno_the_greate> bah, need to adjust my PATH at windows system
2011-10-19T14:34:52  <testit> I use ocaml, which is built with ocamlbuild
2011-10-19T14:34:54  <amstan> cirno_the_greate: oh yeah, fun stuff
2011-10-19T14:35:01  <cirno_the_greate> it's so big that i can bootstrap gcc, i think
2011-10-19T14:35:04  <testit> so it _should_ work to write a myocamlbuild.ml and _tags files for custom build steps?
2011-10-19T14:35:06  <amstan> testit: s/makefile/any build system
2011-10-19T14:35:26  <testit> ah contest rules don't allow it?
2011-10-19T14:35:35  <amstan> testit: they do, but we'll ignore them
2011-10-19T14:35:40  <amstan> testit: we use this to compile things: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py

2011-10-19T14:36:02  <UncleVasya> amstan: We are decided to write. No any work done yet. I will not have a time for it in about 22 hours from this moment.
2011-10-19T14:36:11  <testit> anyway just dropping source code
2011-10-19T14:36:14  <testit> into the dir should work
2011-10-19T14:36:18  <testit> don't really need a build sys
2011-10-19T14:36:19  <amstan> yes
2011-10-19T14:36:39  <amstan> ocaml's dynamic/interpreted isn't it?
2011-10-19T14:36:53  <testit> nope, its got a native compiler too
2011-10-19T14:36:58  <testit> and a bytecode compiler
2011-10-19T14:37:10  <amstan> oh, there: "OCaml"     : [["ocamlbuild -lib unix", BOT + ".native"]],

2011-10-19T14:41:20  <amstan> lightspeed1: only one entry at once
2011-10-19T14:41:22  <Zannick> if you want your bot to play against your other bot, you'll have to do that yourself
2011-10-19T14:41:30  <Zannick> using the provided tools
2011-10-19T14:41:34  <amstan> or that ^
2011-10-19T14:41:42  <lightspeed1> I mean if I submit 2 bots, will they both play against other player's bots, or only the last bot?
2011-10-19T14:42:05  <Zannick> your second submission will overwrite the first one
2011-10-19T14:42:10  <lightspeed1> ah ok

2011-10-19T14:42:25  <amstan> it will
2011-10-19T14:42:43  <amstan> but that's fine, you can always reupload your old version
2011-10-19T14:42:54  <lightspeed1> hmm ok, guess I'll have to test my bots locally against each other and submit only the one with the best strategy

2011-10-19T14:43:26  <amstan> lightspeed1: you can use the server for testing too, since you can submit multiple types over the course of 2 months
2011-10-19T14:43:48  <amstan> theoretically, resubmitting the same bot shouldn't affect your ranking
2011-10-19T14:44:10  <Zannick> it will just take time to redetermine your rank
2011-10-19T14:44:15  <lightspeed1> ah and for the final results you'll rerun the final bots against eachother one more time, right?
2011-10-19T14:44:38  <amstan> yes, the final tournament consists of a period where submissions are closed, but bots are still playing
2011-10-19T14:44:39  <lightspeed1> even if one submits the perfect bot 1s before closing :D
2011-10-19T14:44:44  <amstan> exactly like the server state is now
2011-10-19T14:44:44  <lightspeed1> cool
2011-10-19T14:44:57  <lightspeed1> hmm I was able to submit a bot earlier today
2011-10-19T14:45:12  <lightspeed1> but the site acted weird, kept asking for my password
2011-10-19T14:45:31  <amstan> maybe i was restarting apache when you were doing that
2011-10-19T14:45:54  <amstan> Zannick: mysql seems to be doing much better compared to last contest, no restarts needed for it
2011-10-19T14:46:10  <lightspeed1> also no email about successful compilation
2011-10-19T14:46:11  <Zannick> amstan: cool
2011-10-19T14:46:15  <lightspeed1> do we get an email only on failed one?
2011-10-19T14:46:26  <amstan> lightspeed1: where did you see the email stuff?
2011-10-19T14:46:37  <lightspeed1> in the getting started instructions somewhere
2011-10-19T14:46:41  <amstan> ok
2011-10-19T14:46:42  <lightspeed1> it said that you'll get an email
2011-10-19T14:46:47  <lightspeed1> hold on let me find the page again
2011-10-19T14:46:53  <amstan> i'm not sure what's happening this time, but i think we phased out compile emails
2011-10-19T14:47:07  <amstan> you can find them on your profile page now
2011-10-19T14:47:13  <Zannick> i think the goal was to have that just shown on your profile page now, yeah

2011-10-19T15:11:52  <amstan> xunie-laptop: define that
2011-10-19T15:12:29  <xunie-laptop> Sharing memory between ants, building a map of the world and letting ants communicate globally?
2011-10-19T15:12:59  <wastinger> In the "Starting your own Bot" page it mentions PlayGame.jar but in the tools I downloaded are all written in python and bash?!
2011-10-19T15:13:58  <amstan> wastinger: see using the tools, the other page is out of date

2011-10-19T16:02:38  <janzert> UncleVasya: but do still check the actual values sent to your bot at the start of the game of course

2011-10-19T16:21:47  <mleise> ermau: Unfortunately the JavaScript inside Java I use for the visualizer adds an extra layer of indirection and consumes much more memory than necessary if it was a native compiled application. But it saved me from rewriting the code.
2011-10-19T16:22:09  <ermau> mleise: The visualizer on the website runs way faster :P
2011-10-19T16:22:12  <nekosune_> well so far, I have a lovely AI, it sits there, and does absolutely NOTHING
2011-10-19T16:22:23  <amstan> nekosune_: good one
2011-10-19T16:22:24  <mleise> ermau: Same reason ;)
2011-10-19T16:22:29  <ermau> mleise: Though I suppose it's not running the actual game
2011-10-19T16:22:40  <asw> thanks. only just found the site, keen to have a try, checking I had time left to at least modify the starter packages a little
2011-10-19T16:22:42  <mleise> no, it is only displaying a replay file
2011-10-19T16:22:55  <Zannick> hm
2011-10-19T16:23:00  <amstan> mleise: wouldn't it be nicer if the tools package used the javascript visualizer from a standalone html page?
2011-10-19T16:23:09  <nekosune_> it is supposed to be doing an A* search
2011-10-19T16:23:15  <Zannick> i saw yesterday, and someone else is telling me now, that aichallenge.org is in a redirect loop with beta.aichallenge.org
2011-10-19T16:23:24  <nekosune_> but I cant figure how to debug when the python script is running this thing

2011-10-19T16:23:32  <nomad_man> mleise:  was it sarcasm about new visualizer? i'm not seeing the button even if mouse overing
2011-10-19T16:23:36  <ermau> mleise: Well ouch. I'd probably play with the tools some, but I'm a C# guy and wouldn't want to impose .NET/Mono on people
2011-10-19T16:24:12  <mleise> amstan: The HTML visualizer is in the tools package
2011-10-19T16:24:15  <nekosune_> I am using C#
2011-10-19T16:24:17  <amstan> mleise: oh, ok then
2011-10-19T16:24:18  <Zannick> ah, that's what i did yesterday, right
2011-10-19T16:24:35  <mleise> amstan: It just cannot show games live obviously
2011-10-19T16:24:56  <ermau> Though I may take the C# sample and make it less like Java :P
2011-10-19T16:25:06  <amstan> mleise: but the java one does? understood
2011-10-19T16:25:23  <amstan> nekosune_: debug is complicated, since you have to communicate with it the same way the engine communicates with it
2011-10-19T16:25:39  <nomad_man> where do i find that said debug?  because i'm not seeing it :(
2011-10-19T16:25:40  <amstan> nekosune_: make your bot save the stdin

2011-10-19T16:25:58  <mleise> nomad_man: I'll try FF 7 on my Linux computer and see if I can work around the problem. I would understand if the buttons on the *left* didn't show up, but the ones on the right and on the bottom should really show
2011-10-19T16:26:27  <nomad_man> amstan: i had to modify the flags for the play one game  to get teh stdin to the bot.
2011-10-19T16:26:39  <mleise> nomad_man, nekosune_, amstan: The engine can already save stdin for you!
2011-10-19T16:26:57  <mleise> It's just a flag, look at the usage information from playgame.py
2011-10-19T16:27:08  <nomad_man> mleise:  that's what i did
2011-10-19T16:27:17  <nomad_man> mleise: only 2 buttons are showing alltogether
2011-10-19T16:27:54  <mleise> amstan: right, the java one can do live replays, generate videos and convert replay files to stdin for bots on the command-line
2011-10-19T16:28:06  <nomad_man> mleise:  2 on the right,  zoomout being inactive and  i think "focus"? button
2011-10-19T16:28:35  <mleise> ah the center map button. so only inactive buttons show
2011-10-19T16:28:39  <mleise> we are getting somewhere
2011-10-19T16:29:14  <mleise> FF is notorious for new bugs. The best version is still FF 3, before the switch to quick releases

2011-10-19T17:06:26  <hanswurst> hi, is some kind of threading in the bot code allowed? thx
2011-10-19T17:07:11  <mleise> hanswurst: no, you must use only one thread, unless it is inevitable (JVM spawns multiple threads)
2011-10-19T17:08:32  <amstan> hanswurst: depends on your language, if it supports green threads you can use them
2011-10-19T17:08:40  <amstan> but if they're real threads, you won't be able to spawn them
2011-10-19T17:08:43  <mleise> what are green threads?
2011-10-19T17:08:47  <hanswurst> ok, thx
2011-10-19T17:08:52  <amstan> fake threads that some languages have
2011-10-19T17:08:55  <amstan> i think python does
2011-10-19T17:09:03  <mleise> oh i c
2011-10-19T17:09:11  <ruser> mleise:  so does java 1.2.1 :)
2011-10-19T17:09:12  <janzert> don't think python
2011-10-19T17:09:38  <mintsoup> @mleise so.. given the inevitability of threads on the jvm, does that mean implementations on the jvm are able to be multithreaded?
2011-10-19T17:09:39  <contestbot> mintsoup: I'm sorry Dave, err mintsoup; I cannot 'mleise'.

2011-10-19T17:10:36  <mintsoup> yea just noticed--forgot irc formatting
2011-10-19T17:10:41  <amstan> mleise: it's not a rule, as much as a sandbox limitation
2011-10-19T17:10:51  <mintsoup> mleise: yea i know--was just wondering if that's a loophole in the rules
2011-10-19T17:10:55  <amstan> mintsoup: try it.. if it doesn't work, you have your answer
2011-10-19T17:11:29  <mleise> amstan: I am allowed to spawn threads if it works?
2011-10-19T17:11:33  <amstan> yes

2011-10-19T17:12:10  <amstan> the reason can't have them is because the sandbox cannot track the new threads/processes
2011-10-19T17:12:33  <amstan> but if your language fakes it by having only 1 thread, but multiple threads inside it using async stuff or something, you can do that
2011-10-19T17:13:05  <mleise> amstan: then explain the rules.php to me: "Use of multiple processes or OS threads are prohibited."
2011-10-19T17:13:16  <amstan> mleise: note the OS threads
2011-10-19T17:13:30  <mintsoup> amstan: aren't threads on the jvm "os threads"?
2011-10-19T17:13:37  <amstan> i don't know
2011-10-19T17:13:45  <janzert> the rule is in place because of resource limitations not so much sandbox limitations
2011-10-19T17:14:07  <mleise> janzert: that was my impression, too
2011-10-19T17:15:03  <ruser> mintsoup: they are unless you are java 1.2.1
2011-10-19T17:15:03  <mcstar> once thing i noticed, reading up on clojure, is that clojure agent-references need multiple real jvm threads, the thread-pool cant be empty and these are not so called "green threads", can somebody comment on this?
2011-10-19T17:15:56  <mleise> now we have the trouble? who was the bad guy starting this discussion? :p

2011-10-19T17:17:07  <janzert> mcstar: if you use it your bot has a chance of ending up being killed by the sandbox and if we see a submission actively using more than 1 core we would disqualify it
2011-10-19T17:17:39  <mcstar> janzert: the core of the question is wrt clojure technology, not game regulations
2011-10-19T17:17:56  <ruser> janzert: how are you going to track it against jvm threads? out of curricity
2011-10-19T17:18:17  <mcstar> is it like electricity but more spicy?
2011-10-19T17:18:23  <janzert> pretty sure jvm threads map 1-1 with OS thread
2011-10-19T17:18:29  <janzert> if not then you'll be fine
2011-10-19T17:18:50  <janzert> i.e. if it doesn't use more OS level threads then you're ok
2011-10-19T17:20:20  <mcstar> ibdknox_: you here?
2011-10-19T17:23:14  <nekosune_> Currently just improving the C# skeleton adding stuff like operator overloading

2011-10-19T17:35:06  <janzert> the grouping on those is rather arbitrary

2011-10-19T17:35:22  <janzert> no idea
2011-10-19T17:35:29  <janzert> I'm guessing just no one did it
2011-10-19T17:36:08  <janzert> what should the link to forums be?
2011-10-19T17:36:20  <janzert> just /forums/ I guess
2011-10-19T17:36:25  <amstan> yes
2011-10-19T17:36:36  <amstan> i made a temp redirect from the new server to the old one

2011-10-19T17:36:55  <loverl> I know the contest starts tomorrow, but just so that I know, it will start at 1:00AM EST because google is located in Arkansas, correct?
2011-10-19T17:37:10  <djr_> arkansas is CST
2011-10-19T17:37:33  <loverl> Right, but I'm in New York, so it'll start at 1:00AM for me.

2011-10-19T18:01:20  <janzert> right
2011-10-19T18:01:39  <McLeopold> pick a random number using a pareto dist, find this number of players with the closest match quality

2011-10-19T18:02:14  <janzert> closest match quality here is based on all the players chosen so far?
2011-10-19T18:02:32  <McLeopold> all active submissions
2011-10-19T18:03:22  <janzert> but the quality is measured against just the seed or all players in the game so far?
2011-10-19T18:03:22  <McLeopold> did I answer the question?
2011-10-19T18:03:53  <McLeopold> all players selected, so just the seed for the first opponent, then the 2 players for the 3rd, and so on
2011-10-19T18:03:59  <janzert> ok

2011-10-19T18:04:22  <McLeopold> it's not the actually trueskill match quality with more than 2 players
2011-10-19T18:04:29  <McLeopold> it's more of a soft max
2011-10-19T18:04:47  <McLeopold> http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/01/13/soft-maximum/
2011-10-19T18:05:24  <McLeopold> it is fairly close to the microsoft trueskill calculator
2011-10-19T18:05:33  <janzert> ok
2011-10-19T18:05:39  <McLeopold> okay, we've got a set of potential opponents
2011-10-19T18:05:50  <McLeopold> order by least matches, then least games, then match quality
2011-10-19T18:06:06  <McLeopold> the first will tend to produce a round-robin effect

2011-10-19T18:06:56  <guest1423> Hey, I have a quick question. Under the problem specs, it says "Information about a water square will only be sent the first turn in which it is visible by one of your live ants (to reduce the amount of data transferred)", but I was under the impression that there is no persistent data
2011-10-19T18:06:56  <janzert> least matches is least number of plays again the current set of players?
2011-10-19T18:06:58  <McLeopold> once the players are selected, the map choosen is the least played map by all players
2011-10-19T18:07:51  <janzert> least number against the seed?
2011-10-19T18:07:53  <McLeopold> guest1423: your bot will stay in memory while the game is playing, so you can store that information in a variable somewhere
2011-10-19T18:08:10  <McLeopold> least number against all the players selected so far
2011-10-19T18:08:16  <janzert> ok
2011-10-19T18:08:25  <nekosune_> Okay what happens if ants try and bump into each other?
2011-10-19T18:08:27  <guest1423> McLeopold: Thank you very much. That helps a lot
2011-10-19T18:08:31  <McLeopold> nekosune_: they die

2011-10-19T18:09:11  <janzert> so the question is what in there is causing some ants to get selected 5 times or more than some other ants :/
2011-10-19T18:09:44  <janzert> nekosune_: they have to end in the same square at the end of the turn

2011-10-19T18:11:31  <McLeopold> janzert: if the pareto number is always small, this introduces the error were the small sigma players are selected

2011-10-19T18:12:37  <McLeopold> the idea is that the pool of players might include a high match quality bot, because that bot has tons of games, but it should be last in the pool due to having high game counts

2011-10-19T18:13:00  <nekosune_> hmm it seems they dont die because they get lucky, a third arrives, and confuses the program enough not to make any new moves ...
2011-10-19T18:13:13  <McLeopold> if the pool is only bots with high match quality because of lots of games, then we have a bais, but that really should be rare

2011-10-19T19:20:13  <McLeopold> janzert: I can implement logic that will prevent a bot from playing if it has had too many games in the last 24 hours
2011-10-19T19:21:09  <McLeopold> if I take the distribution of games in last 24 hours for all users, I can chop off the top 10 or 20 percent?
2011-10-19T19:21:40  <McLeopold> or just calc the average?
2011-10-19T19:21:51  <nekosune_> okay now my program dies when an ant does

2011-10-19T19:29:53  <AlexeiS> could somebody help me out getting me started?

2011-10-19T19:30:37  <Zannick> interesting strategy...
2011-10-19T19:30:57  <AlexeiS> i just installed python like i was told. and added it to the directory
2011-10-19T19:31:08  <AlexeiS> when i run from cmd the file "play_one_game_cmd"
2011-10-19T19:31:13  <AlexeiS> i get the following message
2011-10-19T19:31:14  <amstan> AlexeiS: you added it to PATH?
2011-10-19T19:31:24  <AlexeiS> python: can't open file 'C:\Ant': Error 2 no such file or directory
2011-10-19T19:31:29  <Palomides> the line strategy has an amusing bug; see turn ~450
2011-10-19T19:31:34  <ermau> How is that even possible?
2011-10-19T19:31:39  <amstan> ermau: was that you bug that you fixed?

2011-10-19T19:31:50  <AlexeiS> to be honest i dont even know what PATH Is.... its a system variable
2011-10-19T19:31:57  <Palomides> gets boned because a few enemies blocked the front of the column

2011-10-19T19:55:00  <ruser> if food spanwed right next to me,  does my need to "step" on it in order to it?

2011-10-19T19:55:45  <ruser> s/my/my ant/
2011-10-19T19:55:46  <ermau> hmm, are teh starter bots supposed to know where ant hills are?
2011-10-19T19:55:54  <amstan> they have 2 levels of fog of war, one is complete black. the other is shaded, you can see: terrain, hives(at the state of what they were when they were last seen), and maybe food that was seen there last
2011-10-19T19:55:55  <ruser> ermau:  most of htem dn't
2011-10-19T19:56:16  <amstan> mleise: it would be cool if the visualizer had this
2011-10-19T19:56:18  <ermau> ruser: but are they _supposed_ to? (as in, should I go patch the one I'm using)
2011-10-19T19:56:34  <ruser> ermau: depends on your stategy, that's part of the input
2011-10-19T19:56:48  <ermau> If it's part of the input, I'd say that'd be a yes then
2011-10-19T19:57:24  <AlexeiS> need quick help again, can i send somebody here a picture of what happens now when i run the tutorial
2011-10-19T19:57:33  <rmmh> amstan: should be easy enough with a per-player 2D array representing the time a square was first seen
2011-10-19T19:57:40  <amstan> rmmh: yes
2011-10-19T19:58:21  <rmmh> problem: when to calculate it
2011-10-19T19:58:36  <rmmh> would lazy calculation be acceptable?

2011-10-19T19:59:16  <rmmh> i.e. if you turn on fog of war at turn 500, it doesn't know what was seen on turns 1-499 yet, but will update with that when you go backwards
2011-10-19T19:59:33  <amstan> rmmh: it could calculate it the whole time

2011-10-19T20:04:56  <amstan> rmmh: it used to be spawnradius, lol
2011-10-19T20:05:06  <amstan> since they were spawning in place before, not at the hill

2011-10-19T20:05:25  <rmmh> they'd spawn next to the ant that picked it up?
2011-10-19T20:05:39  <amstan> ruser: spawnradius2 should be renamed to foodradius2

2011-10-19T20:11:03  <nack> On rules, it says "Use of multiple processes or OS threads are prohibited.".  Obviously this means no multiple agents running, but does this mean there is no multi-threading within the single bot agent itself?
2011-10-19T20:11:34  <amstan> nack: there's no way to start another agent
2011-10-19T20:11:41  <amstan> nack: so it means within the single bot
2011-10-19T20:11:55  <jbroman> nack: The idea is not to hog all the CPU cores.
2011-10-19T20:12:06  <amstan> depends on your language though, threading might not use OS threads
2011-10-19T20:12:35  <nack> Ah.
2011-10-19T20:12:46  <jbroman> So green threads are OK.
2011-10-19T20:12:59  <McLeopold> ruser: food gathering can happen over the wrapped map
2011-10-19T20:13:42  <nack> Oh okay I see.  Green threads are okay, but not native ones.  Thanks.
2011-10-19T20:14:36  <jbroman> It would be nice if we could lock the process to a single core (so that you could use native threads, but only one core). But I'm not aware of a way to do this without patching the kernel's CPU scheduler.
2011-10-19T20:15:04  <Zannick> aichallenge's own kernel
2011-10-19T20:15:10  <Zannick> great idea for a project
2011-10-19T20:15:30  <jbroman> REWRITE ALL THE THINGS!
2011-10-19T20:15:33  <amstan> if it's modular enough to be easy to install, and if it works on amazon, it should be ok
2011-10-19T20:15:52  <aarossig> jbroman: lol
2011-10-19T20:15:56  <jbroman> amstan: It's more that writing kernel code to do this is non-trivial, and you kinda want it to be stable as welll.
2011-10-19T20:16:07  <jbroman> If you can pull that off, deploying it on EC2 is not a problem. :)
2011-10-19T20:16:33  <jbroman> I would attempt this myself, but I have n units of time and 4n units of things I want to do with it.
2011-10-19T20:16:34  <amstan> maybe we can find volunteers in #linux
2011-10-19T20:17:09  <aarossig> amstan: good idea, maybe csc members?
2011-10-19T20:18:33  <jbroman> Actually
2011-10-19T20:18:43  <jbroman> Apparently there is an API for this and my search terms last time sucked.
2011-10-19T20:18:45  <jbroman> sched_setaffinity
2011-10-19T20:19:10  <jbroman> So that would be cool. :)
2011-10-19T20:19:32  <amstan> so, that's it then? seems to be all we need
2011-10-19T20:19:47  <amstan> we just need a python wrapper
2011-10-19T20:20:14  <jbroman> It could also be put off for a later contest if we want to keep our implementation more stable at this point.
2011-10-19T20:20:17  <aarossig> jbroman: nice find
2011-10-19T20:20:55  <Zannick> yeah, a good candidate to go in zeta
2011-10-19T20:20:56  <Zannick> >.>
2011-10-19T20:21:00  <jbroman> Oh yeah, zeta.
2011-10-19T20:21:04  <Zannick> (haha, zeta.)
2011-10-19T20:21:05  <jbroman> The thing I keep trying to work on.
2011-10-19T20:21:11  <jbroman> And then school/work/life interfere.
2011-10-19T20:21:12  <amstan> lol
2011-10-19T20:21:25  <aarossig> so.. is zeta the name of the next contest? or is that just a codename...
2011-10-19T20:21:36  <jbroman> aarossig: Codename for next version of contest core.

2011-10-19T20:24:35  <aarossig> just ask it for current page views for the day or something like that
2011-10-19T20:24:41  <aarossig> yeah, I think they have an API

2011-10-19T20:27:01  <aarossig> or just make it periodic, every 15 minutes or something
2011-10-19T20:27:15  <amstan> the analytics data is not that accurate though

2011-10-19T21:24:42  <ermau> Hmm, once a bot is eliminated, the engine seems to still wait for it to end it's turn (which it won't do)
2011-10-19T21:25:08  <ermau> So if you increase the turn time to allow for debugger stepping.. you end up having to kill the python process manually
2011-10-19T21:25:29  *** Larose <Larose!~mathieu@184.175.8.140> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-19T21:27:28  <ermau> Is there something in the engine that actually kills processes? Every time I try to attach a debugger, the process dies
2011-10-19T21:27:53  <amstan> ermau: does it time out?
2011-10-19T21:28:04  <amstan> yes, i think the engine does kill the process
2011-10-19T21:28:04  <ermau> amstan: Well I set the timeout to 2 minutes, so it shouldn't
2011-10-19T21:28:11  <ermau> unless the param is getting ignored
2011-10-19T21:28:30  <ermau> which is what it feels like
2011-10-19T21:28:58  <ermau> unless there's a separate timer it pays attention to before the first turn completes?
2011-10-19T21:29:11  <amstan> yes, that too i think
2011-10-19T21:29:23  <ermau> That's probably it then.. I didn't see an arg for it in the batch file

2011-10-19T21:31:30  <ermau> I see, the args in the batch script are misleading (and therefore my original statement is incorrect)
2011-10-19T21:31:48  <ermau> --end_wait was the only timing arg, so I figured it was the turn timer
