2012-07-03T10:35:18  <amstan> delt0r_: darn, so you can't make it before jeff leaves, that's fine
2012-07-03T10:35:32  <amstan> delt0r_: we'll just go without him, but yeah! that is good news
2012-07-03T10:35:55  <amstan> antimatroid, mcstar: right.. so jeff said he'll be making aichallenge his 20% project @google
2012-07-03T10:36:07  <antimatroid> lol
2012-07-03T10:36:18  <antimatroid> good luck with that
2012-07-03T10:36:28  <antimatroid> delt0r_:
2012-07-03T10:36:48  <antimatroid> it sounds to me like a lot of googlers don't end up using their 20%?
2012-07-03T10:36:50  <antimatroid> i could be wrong though
2012-07-03T10:37:03  <antimatroid> it would be worth him hitting up Zannick maybe?
2012-07-03T10:39:15  <mcstar> what is this 20%?
2012-07-03T10:40:29  <amstan> mcstar: every googler is encouraged to use 20% of their work time for other projects not related to their normal work at google
2012-07-03T10:40:44  <amstan> mcstar: it could be any open source project for example
2012-07-03T10:40:54  <mcstar> does this come with 20% of their salary?
2012-07-03T10:41:11  <amstan> no, you still get payed for it
2012-07-03T10:41:15  <amstan> i'm assuming
2012-07-03T10:41:24  <mcstar> so yes
2012-07-03T10:41:28  <mcstar> assuming
