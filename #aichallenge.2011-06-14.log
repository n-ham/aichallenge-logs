2011-06-14T03:26:10  <Zaphus> That game blows up java at around turn 453 for me, don't get to see The end
2011-06-14T03:27:07  <Zaphus> I assume I have a lot of ants at that point
2011-06-14T03:28:33  <UncleVasya> Yes, game situation remains the same, only amount of ants became bigger and bigger. Nothing really changes.
2011-06-14T03:29:10  <UncleVasya> And FPS lowing down :)
2011-06-14T03:29:38  <Zaphus> I should implement attacking :)
2011-06-14T03:29:57  <Zaphus> Or fix the timeout
2011-06-14T03:31:01  <UncleVasya> Your ants slowly killing Malvaian's ants. His territory became lesser and lesser...
2011-06-14T03:31:54  <UncleVasya> Only 9 of his ants where alive when you timed out.
2011-06-14T03:32:03  <Zaphus> Pity - I can't tell where it times out
2011-06-14T03:32:27  <UncleVasya> Their band was "hiding" near the water.
2011-06-14T03:33:03  <Zaphus> Will have to watch when I get home
2011-06-14T03:33:40  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: I'll try to guess the problem.
2011-06-14T03:34:20  <UncleVasya> One of his ants was blocking a way to another 7 his ants.
2011-06-14T03:35:20  <UncleVasya> Maybe every your ant have tried to find a way to them but couldn't?
2011-06-14T03:36:37  <UncleVasya> Zaphus:  If you not going to come home soon I can upload screenshots of that position.

2011-06-14T04:52:59  <stocha> sir_macelon: isn't it frustrating that java doesn't work in there ?
2011-06-14T04:53:56  <sir_macelon> stocha: yes, it is very, but i don't rely on that, more on local testing with your bot as enemy :)
2011-06-14T04:54:55  <sir_macelon> although i could get more test data if it had worked better
2011-06-14T04:55:34  <stocha> sir_macelon: how does the local testing go ? what's your victory percentage with radius = 9 ?
2011-06-14T04:56:14  <stocha> also i found a bug. So if you go with close to 2^n + a  (where a is small) map width, you should see the bot behaving badly.
2011-06-14T04:56:31  <sir_macelon> i'm not checking the victory percentage yet but the behaviour in micro strategy
2011-06-14T04:56:47  <stocha> like 65 width, and 127 width. That should break the bot behavior (although i didn't really test further in fact, just found the low level bug)
2011-06-14T04:56:58  <stocha> sir_macelon: you test combat ? or ?
2011-06-14T04:57:02  <sir_macelon> currently i'm still testing on the symmetric_10 map, didn't check other maps yet
2011-06-14T04:57:13  <stocha> is my bot winning ? :p
2011-06-14T04:57:15  <sir_macelon> still trying to polish for these situations
2011-06-14T04:57:35  <sir_macelon> now it's getting crushed pretty easily :)
2011-06-14T04:57:51  <sir_macelon> but still it's bettern than python hunter bot
2011-06-14T04:58:03  <stocha> the motivation behing publishing my bot was that it is easy to make, and that i was certain a lot of people would implement the idea that are in.
2011-06-14T04:58:11  <sir_macelon> no battle tactics at all and your ants easily die in 2v1 combat
2011-06-14T04:58:25  <stocha> even with radius=9 ?
2011-06-14T04:58:37  <sir_macelon> with radius=9 it is even easier
2011-06-14T04:58:56  <stocha> i didn't though it would be so much time before people can test in a real setting though. I though people would use my bot for one or two weeks.
2011-06-14T04:59:04  <sir_macelon> as i checked some games on the beta now
2011-06-14T04:59:06  <stocha> what does the map look like ?
2011-06-14T04:59:12  <sir_macelon> but didn't test it locally yet
2011-06-14T04:59:19  <stocha> i though with tiny corridors, the clustering would make it okay.
2011-06-14T04:59:30  <sir_macelon> it's symmetric_10 from the official map set
2011-06-14T04:59:32  <stocha> oh, my bot is not on the server now.
2011-06-14T04:59:42  <stocha> it's a c starter bot i think.
2011-06-14T04:59:50  <stocha> under the name stocha.
2011-06-14T04:59:57  <sir_macelon> yes, but i saw how my bot performes with the 9 radius on 2v1
2011-06-14T05:00:17  <stocha> do you work for nokia ?
2011-06-14T05:00:34  <sir_macelon> and it does handle it pretty well
2011-06-14T05:00:37  <sir_macelon> yup
2011-06-14T05:01:23  <stocha> you use the official engine for testing ?
2011-06-14T05:01:30  <stocha> or do you have your own framework ?
2011-06-14T05:01:56  <sir_macelon> yes, i download it from github from time to time if there are major changes
2011-06-14T05:02:18  <UncleVasya> sir_macelon: I can give you my bot. It's better then HunterBot. stocha's bot much better than my and your current bot better but maybe it will be helpful. My doesn't crash.
2011-06-14T05:02:21  <sir_macelon> i was thinking about own framework
2011-06-14T05:03:02  <sir_macelon> but i've dediced it would be to much work
2011-06-14T05:03:22  <sir_macelon> maybe if the engine would be written in java then i could take it
2011-06-14T05:03:27  <sir_macelon> as it was for planet wars
2011-06-14T05:03:40  <sir_macelon> but i'm pretty confident with the jUnit
2011-06-14T05:06:17  <sir_macelon> UncleVasya: thanks bot if your bot is not stronger than stocha's then it won't help me i think, but thanks anyway

2011-06-14T06:06:54  <stocha> i think it's logical that i uploaded my bot. And it was probably usefull for at least a few people. So it's worthy work. Maybe tomorow 'ill be bored about ant and make nothing more.
2011-06-14T06:07:05  <stocha> sir_macelon: why do you want to win ?
2011-06-14T06:07:46  <stocha> i have built a testing framework in the early days. it doesn't add much, because it's mainly for testing bot whole strategy. no unit tests.
2011-06-14T06:07:53  <sir_macelon> stocha: it is a contest isn't it?
2011-06-14T06:08:02  <stocha> sir_macelon: how do you use junit ?
2011-06-14T06:08:27  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: there is a reply converter issue opened, you could push it
2011-06-14T06:08:33  <stocha> sir_macelon: speaking with some people, i happened to remark that most that really want to win, would have some statable reasons. If one dig enough to find them :p
2011-06-14T06:09:23  <stocha> I know i did. but i don't know if they are good reasons really :) And then i'm not to fancy about them either.
2011-06-14T06:09:43  <sir_macelon> stocha: what i learned from planet wars challenge is that unit test is a must, saves a lot of debugging time
2011-06-14T06:10:43  <Zaphus> sir_macelon: Thanks, I've added a comment to that issue
2011-06-14T06:10:55  <stocha> yeah. i happend to find this nasty bug in my most basic functions. That would render every experiment i ran hard to conclude out of.
2011-06-14T06:11:12  <stocha> but then ... i did do some test on this part !
2011-06-14T06:11:27  <sir_macelon> you need to make a proper design of your bot to enable easy mocking and stubbing
2011-06-14T06:11:28  <stocha> maybe they were not the appropriate tests though.
2011-06-14T06:11:30  <Zaphus> sir_macelon:  I've never written a unit test - is that simply a case of "given this input, we expect this output" for lots of cases ?

2011-06-14T06:13:01  <UncleVasya> ?
2011-06-14T06:13:43  <stocha> i wonder if other strong java bots, used mine for tuning.

2011-06-14T06:15:36  <stocha> it was some time ago now. maybe a week. or two ?
2011-06-14T06:15:47  <stocha> i don't have clear picture of time line :p
2011-06-14T06:16:07  <Zaphus> stocha: so what you really mean is that the best coders happen to be using Java, I doubt that the language is the reason they are doing well
2011-06-14T06:16:09  <stocha> Zaphus: maybe it's good that jvm doesn't work on official test after all :p
2011-06-14T06:16:21  <sir_macelon> stocha: what would you plan to include in that test framework?
2011-06-14T06:16:24  <stocha> Zaphus: maybe there are other factors
2011-06-14T06:16:33  <sir_macelon> some sample battle situations?
2011-06-14T06:17:11  <stocha> sir_macelon: the possibility to hand craft a map situation, affect a bot to each side, and watch it move by move mainly. Then you need some way to ouput internal state. That i have still to image what it should look like :p
2011-06-14T06:17:51  <stocha> sir_macelon: obvioulsy a way to autogenerate the handcrafter maps also, would be an addition :p
2011-06-14T06:18:01  <Zaphus> UncleVasya: It Works !!!
2011-06-14T06:18:20  <UncleVasya> I am happy!
2011-06-14T06:18:26  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  you need to add the --attackradius2 option, since thats currently being played with (was 4, now 9)
2011-06-14T06:18:36  <sir_macelon> stocha: well that is just what my junit tests are doing, but only for one turn
2011-06-14T06:18:46  <stocha> sir_macelon: maybe a way to play the game, out of non wrapping map also. like you hand craft a part of the map, and then the rest is random. i don't know :p
2011-06-14T06:18:58  <sir_macelon> but i prefer to create situations manually
2011-06-14T06:19:08  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: thanks for suggestions. It's exactly what I need.
2011-06-14T06:19:13  <sir_macelon> when i observe my bot moving suboptimally
2011-06-14T06:19:15  <stocha> i know that the wrapping cripted some of my try at unit test.
2011-06-14T06:19:52  <Zaphus> UncleVasya: also, the title is "3/21" which I guess is 3/21 maps, but only 3 were possible
2011-06-14T06:20:00  <sir_macelon> you'd then need to write the whole engine
2011-06-14T06:20:11  <stocha> sir_macelon: i already have  whole engine.
2011-06-14T06:20:34  <stocha> i used it to build the stocha bot. It was like a 7th generation bot.
2011-06-14T06:20:36  <sir_macelon> stocha: tested?
2011-06-14T06:20:48  <stocha> the 1st generation being random direction for each ant, with no collision code :p
2011-06-14T06:20:57  <stocha> no consideration of water and food.
2011-06-14T06:21:03  <sir_macelon> i've opened two issues against the engine
2011-06-14T06:21:15  <sir_macelon> and both are not yet solved i think
2011-06-14T06:21:24  <stocha> my engine was built with some simplifications i think.
2011-06-14T06:21:32  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: yeah, I don't count possible maps amount, but it may go like "1/21  5/21  17/21"
2011-06-14T06:21:38  <stocha> for example food trigger radius was fixed at 1
2011-06-14T06:21:48  <stocha> (cross around food)

2011-06-14T06:23:09  <sir_macelon> stocha: so indeed you have a good starting point :P
2011-06-14T06:23:15  <stocha> You have some gif of it, on the forum. There used to have applets also, but my server is down now that i don't have the fund to pay for it :p
2011-06-14T06:23:43  <UncleVasya> UncleVasya: Is there another options that people can want for testing?
2011-06-14T06:23:47  <stocha> sir_macelon: i can publish the code if people wants to work on it maybe. i don't know how to publish it though.
2011-06-14T06:23:50  <UncleVasya> wow, again :)
2011-06-14T06:23:59  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: Is there another options that people can want for testing?
2011-06-14T06:24:01  <Zaphus> sir_macelon:  so for unit tests, are you doing it within your own codebase (i.e. code linked together with your bot) or as an external app
2011-06-14T06:24:02  <stocha> i don't know what kindof state it is in
2011-06-14T06:24:06  <sir_macelon> you can use the git repository
2011-06-14T06:24:22  <sir_macelon> make it public, maybe people would work on it
2011-06-14T06:24:29  <stocha> sir_macelon: the official one ? i there a branch for wild and mad experiments ?
2011-06-14T06:24:52  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  How about "Only maps of this number of bots" (because it currently tests 4,5 as well as 6 when you have 6 bots)
2011-06-14T06:25:01  <stocha> sir_macelon: i was more inclined to put it in a separate place; Official stuff is heavy and messy as it is.
2011-06-14T06:25:29  <stocha> sir_macelon: maybe i email you the code, (let's say it's gnu licence) and then you do whatever you want with it ? :p
2011-06-14T06:25:31  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: i create unit tests for separate classes or sets of classes if they are coupled
2011-06-14T06:25:51  <stocha> you put it in the official if you think it's good, you put in your trash if it's not usable as it is, i don't know :p
2011-06-14T06:26:13  <Zaphus> stocha: you can just make another git repository at github, unrelated to the official one
2011-06-14T06:26:23  <sir_macelon> so they are running together with my bot's code, but not in a way an engine would run it
2011-06-14T06:27:06  <sir_macelon> stocha: just create your own account and repository on github
2011-06-14T06:27:10  <stocha> Zaphus: then i will have to learn how to use it. i have few energy to do ant related stuff as it is. i'm not too happy with learning with new tools, unless in very good mood
2011-06-14T06:27:20  <stocha> it is a consipiration isn't it.
2011-06-14T06:27:30  <stocha> okay maybe i'll do just that but there is problem.
2011-06-14T06:27:35  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: I'll add an --attackradius2 option and then make a release on the forums. Then updates will go.
2011-06-14T06:27:46  <stocha> 1) low functions i use are used also in the engine
2011-06-14T06:28:01  <Zaphus> stocha:  fair enough, got to use your time wisely
2011-06-14T06:28:03  <stocha> (wich when i think of it, means it will suffer from the same bug, well well)
2011-06-14T06:28:17  <stocha> i think i would be happy to publish it really.
2011-06-14T06:28:35  <stocha> i felt very good about the idea that some people found my bot actually usefull :)
2011-06-14T06:28:41  <stocha> when i published it.
2011-06-14T06:29:05  <sir_macelon> stocha: if you are familiar to svn then it shouldn't be hard
2011-06-14T06:29:07  <stocha> i think guys like antimatroid might feel that i twist too much the constest though. i know he did when he learnt that i published my bot.
2011-06-14T06:29:11  <UncleVasya> Zaphus:  Also before release i need to fix language mistakes. Are they exists?

2011-06-14T06:29:38  <stocha> i used to use svn a lot (for very basic version control). I stoped using it on my own projects a few years ago though :p
2011-06-14T06:29:47  <Zaphus> UncleVasya: Just checking, plus looking for some other bugs, hang on
2011-06-14T06:30:32  <stocha> seeing how things goes right now, i'm might as well publish the framework. buggy and maybe bad written as it is. to bad if people use it and it gives an advantage to java people :p
2011-06-14T06:30:54  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  Bug: The Total line (in blue) only gives the first four bots, needs to do all that were in any map, same for places & survived
2011-06-14T06:30:57  <sir_macelon> i've learned svn just a couple of months ago and i consider myself still new to it
2011-06-14T06:31:03  <stocha> If it was me, i could even publish stocha_bot code. but then i'll be fired for sure :p
2011-06-14T06:31:20  <sir_macelon> but it took me minutes to set my git repo
2011-06-14T06:31:23  <Zaphus> UncleVasya:  "Bad End" should be "Failures" (or something like that)
2011-06-14T06:31:28  <sir_macelon> with tutorial
2011-06-14T06:31:36  <stocha> let me try to do that then. will see.
2011-06-14T06:32:25  <Zaphus> UncleVasya: Bug: Running for a second time gives a "testing" tab with nothing in it, if you switch tabs and come back it's got stuff (maps and bots)
2011-06-14T06:32:51  <sir_macelon> stocha: you're published bot can be decompiled anyway, in fact i did it, but it was too messy for me to take a look inside :P
2011-06-14T06:33:04  <sir_macelon> *your
2011-06-14T06:33:29  <stocha> sir_macelon: you have all the debug info inside don't you ?
2011-06-14T06:33:55  <stocha> sir_macelon: i stated on the forum, that it was forbiden to decompile it. you are lucky i don't know you did, or i would sue you !
2011-06-14T06:34:13  <stocha> sir_macelon: what was messy about it ? x_x
2011-06-14T06:34:27  <sir_macelon> bit operations
2011-06-14T06:34:34  <stocha> ah yeah it's one of the old version also.
2011-06-14T06:34:49  <stocha> so all the code is down there, if not in the upper class. quite messy the bot itself.
2011-06-14T06:36:01  <stocha> i think i'll try to publish my old testing framework. it gives me something to do after all. i'm not that much into the game as i was when i built the stocha bots, and run all my experiments to understand the game :p
2011-06-14T06:36:15  <stocha> i'm afraid you will find it messy though :p
2011-06-14T06:36:38  <stocha> but the thing is, bit operation framework, really unable to have a fast and clean engine for the game. Even if mine isn't :p
2011-06-14T06:36:58  <stocha> enable not unable.
2011-06-14T06:38:57  <stocha> arrr, they use ssh keys. it's a damn hard thing to use with a mac. i didn't found any free sftp using ssh key for mac os x.
2011-06-14T06:39:31  <Zaphus> so is there a tool to do testing outside of the code (i.e. I feed data to the bot like the engine would) ?
2011-06-14T06:39:40  <sir_macelon> you can use http instead
2011-06-14T06:40:17  <stocha> my testing framework had java to java interface for bot communication.
2011-06-14T06:40:51  <stocha> for example i wrapped the stocha-bot inside the java starter bot through a bridge.

2011-06-14T06:41:30  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: what would you expect from such tool to do?

2011-06-14T06:42:18  <Zaphus> same thing, just using the actual game inputs rather than... whatever it is you do with unit testing
2011-06-14T06:42:59  <sir_macelon> the advantage of unit testing is that you can debug code with ide
2011-06-14T06:43:07  <sir_macelon> you can access the object's state
2011-06-14T06:43:17  <Zaphus> I guess I just dont know how you would feed it the data.  but yes, I see why that way would be better
2011-06-14T06:43:20  <sir_macelon> no need to write any debug into logs
2011-06-14T06:43:44  <sir_macelon> but this also depends on the programming language you are using
2011-06-14T06:43:54  <stocha> i never use debugger
2011-06-14T06:44:05  <stocha> i always built my own way to see object states.
2011-06-14T06:44:26  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: you need to have a proper interface inside your bot, it's a design issue
2011-06-14T06:44:51  <Zaphus> c++ for me, just browsing to see what unit test things are out there, I think I'll give it a try.   would love some hints on how to design for unit tests
2011-06-14T06:45:06  <sir_macelon> stocha: i recommend you to try to use debugger, it is really the quickest way to find the root cause of the bug
2011-06-14T06:45:12  <stocha> in fact it's possible to simply extend the official comunication format, to make debugging (and even visual debugging ) possible.
2011-06-14T06:45:33  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: then you should check the cpptest framework
2011-06-14T06:45:38  <stocha> sir_macelon: i really never had any problem finding the root of a bug in my programs with java.
2011-06-14T06:45:44  <sir_macelon> sorry cppunit
2011-06-14T06:46:12  <stocha> i had sometime the trouble of not spoting the bug in the first place. as for my bit manipulation framework in it's current state
2011-06-14T06:46:20  <stocha> i found the bugs while testing the C version :p
2011-06-14T06:46:21  <sir_macelon> stocha: it's not the matter of finding but how quickly you can do it
2011-06-14T06:46:52  <stocha> i asked myself : why would my C version not work ???? i asked it for like 4 hours. Until i tryed the java one with same parameters ... it had the same behavior :p
2011-06-14T06:47:46  <stocha> sir_macelon:  i certainly find root of bugs so quick, that i don't even remember it, if it is in my own code. (it work up to a certain code size, which i hope the ant contest won't excess :p )
2011-06-14T06:48:17  <stocha> other's code is another matter. i was happy with debugger then. hopefully i didn't do that a lot yet.
2011-06-14T06:48:39  <stocha> debugger are good for hacking through other code.
2011-06-14T06:48:46  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: for unit testing you need to separate the parsing of bot input logic from updating game state logic
2011-06-14T06:49:23  <sir_macelon> unfortunatelly most of the starter bots do not support that
2011-06-14T06:49:50  <sir_macelon> you can take a look at my java starter bot
2011-06-14T06:50:08  <sir_macelon> it is properly designed for unit testing
2011-06-14T06:50:45  <sir_macelon> reading and parsing code is seprated from other stuff with proper interfaces
2011-06-14T06:51:29  <sir_macelon> stocha: it depends how complicated is your code
2011-06-14T06:51:47  <sir_macelon> it's easy to find bugs in small apps
2011-06-14T06:52:25  <sir_macelon> but i can't imagine how you'd do it in a one consisting of hundreds or thousands lines of code
2011-06-14T06:52:25  <stocha> or well architectured apps, with free access to meaningfull states :p
2011-06-14T06:53:04  <sir_macelon> without a debugger

2011-06-14T06:53:17  <sir_macelon> when for example some multi-threading is involved
2011-06-14T06:53:27  <stocha> i would need servere separation and modularity beside this point.

2011-06-14T06:53:46  <stocha> is debugger helpfull for multithreading ?
2011-06-14T06:53:53  <sir_macelon> yet you need to have overview of the whole code
2011-06-14T06:54:05  <stocha> my debug workflow is all about exploring the state. so it's not that different from using a debugger.
2011-06-14T06:54:10  <sir_macelon> yes, you can manually suspend threads
2011-06-14T06:54:41  <sir_macelon> and then go step by step after each line of code
2011-06-14T06:54:56  <sir_macelon> detecting any deadlocks
2011-06-14T06:54:58  <stocha> i made an app once, with multithreaded recursive functions. And i built a UI to see the state, you could pause the process or launch them back etc.
2011-06-14T06:55:01  <sir_macelon> or synch problems
2011-06-14T06:55:25  <stocha> well, i guess that a well used debugger is good.
2011-06-14T06:55:40  <stocha> the problem with debugger, is that new out of school people tend to rely on it.
2011-06-14T06:55:44  <sir_macelon> glad you finally agreed :)

2011-06-14T07:02:51  <stocha> sir_macelon: what i don't like with debugger, is that there is no remembering of the process of finding the bug.
2011-06-14T07:03:41  <stocha> sir_macelon: you can just hack through code wildly. I you have to do that, then there is architectural problem that need to be adressed.
2011-06-14T07:04:18  <stocha> I think the good architecture is the one that make the finding of bugs root the easiest.
2011-06-14T07:04:43  <stocha> and also somewhate minimize the risk that there will be bug root in the first place.
2011-06-14T07:04:51  <sir_macelon> i do agree with that statement

2011-06-14T07:07:32  <guyverthree> what type of repo you using ???
2011-06-14T07:07:48  <stocha> ghit hub
2011-06-14T07:07:57  <guyverthree> oh right i have no idea
2011-06-14T07:07:59  <stocha> there was a concensus it is the way to go
2011-06-14T07:08:02  <guyverthree> only really used SVN
2011-06-14T07:08:08  <sir_macelon> stocha: use http
2011-06-14T07:08:15  <guyverthree> yeah i'm a bit behind the times
2011-06-14T07:08:19  <stocha> what do i do, how do i do it ?
2011-06-14T07:08:33  <olexs> why without ssh keys? it's fairly simple
2011-06-14T07:08:51  <sir_macelon> git clone your_repo_http_address
2011-06-14T07:09:02  <stocha> i have macosx. unless you can help me with it, i won't trust you it is simple :p
2011-06-14T07:09:20  <stocha> i need to install git then i guess :p
2011-06-14T07:09:24  <olexs> stocha: it is, and I think I can help you :)
2011-06-14T07:09:31  <olexs> stocha: yes, you'll need that anyway
2011-06-14T07:09:32  <guyverthree> I develop of windows so i know you fustration with all the linux developer stuff
2011-06-14T07:09:48  <stocha> olexs: okay so first i'll try to install git and see if it goes smooth :p
2011-06-14T07:10:11  <olexs> basically, http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/
2011-06-14T07:10:27  <stocha> do people really use checksums ?
2011-06-14T07:10:37  <olexs> all the ssh stuff is explained there as well
2011-06-14T07:10:38  <stocha> i know i never checked them
2011-06-14T07:11:02  <olexs> i check them with large downloads like system images, just to be on the safe side...
2011-06-14T07:11:17  <stocha> olexs: okay thanks. i guess i have few excuse not to try now :p
2011-06-14T07:11:31  <stocha> i don't even know how to check them :p
2011-06-14T07:13:27  <stocha> mm, now when i type "git" in the console, i got some git stuff printing. i guess i'm done ?
2011-06-14T07:13:58  <antimatroid> stocha: do the passkey stuff
2011-06-14T07:14:16  <antimatroid> i didn't find it very well explained, but you can use anything as the pass key, like "the cat sat on the mat"
2011-06-14T07:14:23  <antimatroid> it doesn't have to be something special
2011-06-14T07:15:56  <stocha> Since there is already an SSH directory you’ll want to back the old one up and remove it:
2011-06-14T07:16:05  <stocha> doesn't sound too good to me 0_o
2011-06-14T07:16:18  <stocha> why do they want me to remove the key i use at work ?
2011-06-14T07:16:19  <olexs> have you ever used ssh on your mac?
2011-06-14T07:16:36  <olexs> if you already have a key, you don't need to generate a new one
2011-06-14T07:16:36  <stocha> yeah. i use it at work. it's a nightmare.
2011-06-14T07:16:46  <stocha> i think i put the keyx somewhere. and use some scripts.
2011-06-14T07:17:10  <antimatroid> ah, yeah i didn't have to worry about past stuff there
2011-06-14T07:17:13  <stocha> i'm think i probably don't use the keyx in ~/.ssh
2011-06-14T07:17:23  <antimatroid> i think you can get away with pulling without that
2011-06-14T07:17:30  <antimatroid> but you wont be able to push etc.
2011-06-14T07:17:39  <stocha> so probably can remove it, and see what it does. But seems silly that you have to remove it
2011-06-14T07:18:06  <olexs> back it up and remove it, if anything breaks you can always restore your backup and try something else for github...
2011-06-14T07:20:56  <stocha> it seems there was no key in there. only the directories
2011-06-14T07:21:13  *** Cyndre_ <Cyndre_!~Cyndre@DOCSIS-181-75.cable-lynx.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2011-06-14T07:22:44  <stocha> maybe i should rename it "stocha advanced starter java bot" :p so i then can publish the code. After all, that's what the hunter bot is isn't it ?
2011-06-14T07:24:53  <stocha> here is my problem : how do i open the file in ~/.ssh with textedit ?
2011-06-14T07:25:20  <stocha> textedit is not a valid command after all
2011-06-14T07:25:32  <stocha> olexs: ?
2011-06-14T07:25:33  <olexs> use textmate
2011-06-14T07:25:44  <olexs> or nano
2011-06-14T07:25:49  <stocha> it's not a valid command either
2011-06-14T07:25:59  <olexs> you have a mac and don't have textmate? shame on you :)
2011-06-14T07:26:02  <stocha> maybe i'll just put the key into a normal file, and textedit it from there
2011-06-14T07:26:16  <olexs> what's the command for mac basic text editor...
2011-06-14T07:26:20  <stocha> shame on me for having a mac on the first place if you want my opinion
2011-06-14T07:26:32  <stocha> i want unbuntu. or even windows back !
2011-06-14T07:27:01  <olexs> ah
2011-06-14T07:27:06  <olexs> "edit ~/.ssh"
2011-06-14T07:27:51  <stocha> edit doesn't work. what i will do is cat key > somewhere i can see it
2011-06-14T07:27:53  <olexs> or... wtf.
2011-06-14T07:28:18  <olexs> "open -e ~/.ssh" ? :)
2011-06-14T07:28:29  <olexs> how can it be so complicated...
2011-06-14T07:28:41  <stocha> at least it works
2011-06-14T07:29:00  <stocha> with my way. well it's mac. it's made for people that want to syncrhonize their iphone. Not for developpers
2011-06-14T07:29:30  <olexs> I use a macbook for work in the university quite a lot, it's actually ok
2011-06-14T07:29:32  <stocha> even the damn keyboard isn't right
2011-06-14T07:30:05  <stocha> now i can't properly use neither a mac, nor a pc keyboard.
2011-06-14T07:30:34  <stocha> in java it's ctrl+key and in other app, it's apple+ key. really
2011-06-14T07:31:22  <olexs> so why do you have to use a mac if you dislike it so much? :)
2011-06-14T07:31:29  <stocha> so i now have added the key.
2011-06-14T07:32:01  <stocha> olexs: at the point, i didn't knew i would dislike it so much. i even had doubt at some point. i like the trackpad, and the fact you can make key shine in the dark.
2011-06-14T07:32:30  <stocha> i like the magnetic stuff. like the power supply
2011-06-14T07:32:41  <stocha> then i dislike the keyboard layout (paramount) and the system.
2011-06-14T07:33:02  <stocha> to the point i won't own a mac beside this one. hopefully.
2011-06-14T07:33:07  <olexs> you like the hardware, your problems seem to lie in software. why not install windows or ubuntu on it? problem solved, all the up sides remain :)
2011-06-14T07:33:13  <stocha> then i dislike the firm strategy.
2011-06-14T07:33:25  <stocha> i don't like the keyboard ! that's hardware.
2011-06-14T07:33:30  <olexs> hm
2011-06-14T07:33:34  <stocha> well i think it is.
2011-06-14T07:33:53  <stocha> plus i don't like to spend hours installing stuff :p
2011-06-14T07:34:01  <stocha> only to find out nothing really work in the end.
2011-06-14T07:34:08  <olexs> I use standard IBM layout on it... only "mac thing" are the cmd+... combos instead of ctrl+..., but I got used to those
2011-06-14T07:34:41  <stocha> maybe i should have done that. but know it's to late. i have both keyboard layout confused in my head :p
2011-06-14T07:34:59  <stocha> (it's been like 6 month of mac keyboard already)
2011-06-14T07:35:46  <zaphus> anyone want to donate their (compiled) bot to me, for testing purposes ?  it's hard testing against yourself all the time, I need some variety !
2011-06-14T07:36:06  <olexs> you'll need a mac binary, right?
2011-06-14T07:36:11  <olexs> ahh
2011-06-14T07:36:23  <zaphus> no, not me, Windows
2011-06-14T07:36:37  <olexs> sorry, confused by my irc client somewhat :)
2011-06-14T07:36:42  <zaphus> lol
2011-06-14T07:36:44  <olexs> I can give you my current .exe
2011-06-14T07:37:16  <zaphus> yeah, I'd love to try it
2011-06-14T07:37:41  <stocha> Congratulations, you now have Git and GitHub all set up! What do you want to do next?
2011-06-14T07:38:32  <olexs> zaphus: http://stuff.olex.biz/leviathan.exe
2011-06-14T07:38:33  <stocha> i want to eat, and go to bed :p thanks for asking.
2011-06-14T07:39:15  <olexs> muahaha, compile date: 14.06.2011 13:37... *ahem*
2011-06-14T07:39:39  <zaphus> 1337  :-)
2011-06-14T07:39:46  <UncleVasya> olexs: I've got it too, thanks.
2011-06-14T07:40:03  <stocha> that's paris time
2011-06-14T07:40:35  <olexs> no problem :) could I have some binaries, too? testing against example bots gets boring quickly
2011-06-14T07:40:55  <stocha> why don't use stocha bot ?
2011-06-14T07:41:08  <olexs> where can I get it?
2011-06-14T07:41:29  <stocha> someone should make it available :p you can find it on the forum
2011-06-14T07:41:35  <stocha> under the tcp server thread i think
2011-06-14T07:41:45  <stocha> i gave it as a mean to test, until there is a tcp server
2011-06-14T07:42:03  <stocha> wich i though would happen in a few days from my posting it. i maybe have been wrong.
2011-06-14T07:42:53  <stocha> ahh it was on my server
2011-06-14T07:42:57  <stocha> my server no longer exists
2011-06-14T07:42:57  <olexs> I thought about putting one up. Basically, one would only need a wrapper to connect bot I/O streams to the python game engine, and a skill system of sorts
2011-06-14T07:43:05  <stocha> so you'll have to ask to someone who already has it :p
2011-06-14T07:43:18  <stocha> unless i put it on my newbrand github thing
2011-06-14T07:43:34  <UncleVasya> olexs: I propose my bot to people again and again but they always refuse because it's weak. You are the first one who didn't squeamish about it. :)
2011-06-14T07:43:47  <zaphus> stocha: where in the forums is it, is there a link you can give me ?
2011-06-14T07:44:02  <olexs> UncleVasya: well, there is little chance it's worse than example bots, is there? :)
2011-06-14T07:44:11  <stocha> on the forum was a link to my server. but the server is not there anymore
2011-06-14T07:44:18  <zaphus> oh, ok
2011-06-14T07:44:19  <stocha> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1362
2011-06-14T07:44:46  <stocha> i still have it though. so if you find i place for me to upload it, then i can put it in there.
2011-06-14T07:45:09  <stocha> i think i will just github it and be done with it though
2011-06-14T07:45:25  <olexs> that should be simplest
2011-06-14T07:45:26  <stocha> once i figure how the thing work that is.
2011-06-14T07:46:25  <olexs> UncleVasya: so where can I get your binary, then? :)
2011-06-14T07:46:43  <UncleVasya> olexs:  My bot seats in the 5th-11th places for a 5 days already. Usually it's 7th-9th place.
2011-06-14T07:47:07  <zaphus> olexs: Thats not your current leviathan bot, is it (the one you gave me a link to) ?
2011-06-14T07:47:30  <olexs> zaphus: should be... unless I messed with the code again after putting it up, which I don't think I did
2011-06-14T07:48:25  <zaphus> olexs: ok, it's just not doing well against three copies of my bot - but that isn't really a fair fight :-)   then again, my latest version is getting whipped by my older ones too...
2011-06-14T07:49:03  <olexs> has the attack radius been changed to 9 already? that should break some pre-defined logic
2011-06-14T07:49:21  <zaphus> yes, it's at 9 on the beta server, and on my home tests
2011-06-14T07:49:44  <olexs> okay, in that case I should rewrite my "move book". you'll get the updated binary when I'm done if you want :)
2011-06-14T07:50:11  <UncleVasya> olexs: http://www.filefactory.com/file/ccded9b/n/UncleVasya_13.7z
2011-06-14T07:51:07  <zaphus> sure, would love it !
2011-06-14T07:51:27  <olexs> and I really need to get my test framework going
2011-06-14T07:52:06  <olexs> UncleVasya: thank you.
2011-06-14T07:54:01  <guyverthree> Yeah I was thinking of doing some perl scripts which would run a bunch of gaem and then give me some stats so i can see if a change has improved or destroyed my bot
2011-06-14T07:54:05  <UncleVasya> olexs: Do not hurry. If it will be useful than you'll thank me.
2011-06-14T07:54:25  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: Are you under Windows?
2011-06-14T07:57:20  <stocha> hopefull you will find a jar of the bot in there https://github.com/stocha/Stocha_google_contest_antwars_Sample_Engine-
2011-06-14T07:57:29  <stocha> clicking the download button
2011-06-14T07:57:33  <stocha> let me know how it goes.
2011-06-14T07:58:06  <stocha> this time i allow people uncompiling the code. because some already did.
2011-06-14T07:58:26  <zaphus> download doesnt work for me, maybe we have to wait a little while ?
2011-06-14T07:58:38  <stocha> what does it do ?
2011-06-14T07:58:58  <stocha> Not Found: Bad archive command for stocha/Stocha_google_contest_antwars_Sample_Engine-/master
2011-06-14T07:59:06  <zaphus> yeah, that :-)
2011-06-14T07:59:08  <stocha> if someone can explain me what's wrong with the git thing ?
2011-06-14T07:59:28  <stocha> maybe it doesn like my projects code name ?

2011-06-14T07:59:43  <zaphus> that minus at the end feels dodgy, but there's nothing technically wrong with that

2011-06-14T08:00:06  <stocha> i don't remember adding a minus by the way
2011-06-14T08:01:05  <zaphus> I think I've created the first bot that times out because it's thinking too hard, it just leaves the other bot to itself and keeps growing, eventually having too many ants to process within the time limit I guess
2011-06-14T08:01:52  <stocha> how does git know where to send the commit command by the way ??
2011-06-14T08:03:03  <olexs> zaphus: happened to me already, too. some optimization helped, now it doesn't timeout on beta server even with a few thousand ants
2011-06-14T08:03:04  <Naktibalda> it commits locally, doesn't it?
2011-06-14T08:03:22  <stocha> maybe

2011-06-14T08:03:31  <dr-> y
2011-06-14T08:03:35  <stocha> why can i see the commit on github then
2011-06-14T08:03:35  <dr-> you need to push then
2011-06-14T08:04:34  <zaphus> ah, I see why it would time out... some dumb-ish code that I'm not really utilizing anyway, might do an update just to get around that
2011-06-14T08:04:44  <dr-> you have to do something like that
2011-06-14T08:04:52  <dr-> $ git push origin master
2011-06-14T08:04:57  <zaphus> will have to write a better version of that code for later though
2011-06-14T08:05:22  <stocha> yeah i didn't do it, so let me try and see if it solve the problem :p
2011-06-14T08:06:52  <stocha> https://github.com/stocha/antwars_Sample_Engine
2011-06-14T08:07:02  <stocha> okay let's try to download from there then :p
2011-06-14T08:07:23  <stocha> it may work this time :p

2011-06-14T08:09:06  <guyverthree> i don't know if i am doing it right ?
2011-06-14T08:09:37  <zaphus> guyverthree type their name as the first word in the sentence

2011-06-14T08:09:54  <guyverthree> thanks
2011-06-14T08:10:04  <guyverthree> zaphus something like this yes
2011-06-14T08:10:06  <guyverthree> :)
2011-06-14T08:10:27  <zaphus> stocha:  do I need to rename the jar to something ?  not sure how to launch it
2011-06-14T08:10:42  <zaphus> guyverthree: yes, only the target person sees you as red though
2011-06-14T08:10:43  <UncleVasya> I don't really know what kind of statistic you want but this app is for multigames testing and shows some statistic info: http://www.filefactory.com/file/ccdd2e6/n/AntsTesting_0.3_RC_3_Zaphus.7z
2011-06-14T08:10:50  <stocha> you go java -jar nameofthe.jar
2011-06-14T08:10:58  <stocha> in the standard engine
2011-06-14T08:11:06  <stocha> it's a bot
2011-06-14T08:11:15  <stocha> so you put that in the bot loader script
2011-06-14T08:11:52  <zaphus> ah, got it, had a typo
2011-06-14T08:12:23  <UncleVasya> zaphus: I fixed maps info in the form caption, added --viewradius, --spawnradius and --attackradius options.
2011-06-14T08:12:31  <guyverthree> unclevasya: thanks i don't know, was thinking ant at turn 50 turn 100
2011-06-14T08:12:38  <guyverthree> game won, lost
2011-06-14T08:12:45  <guyverthree> any timeout game highlighted
2011-06-14T08:13:23  <UncleVasya> guyverthree:  won/lost  timeouted/crashed/survived/eliminated  -  you can find that info there.
2011-06-14T08:13:27  <guyverthree> so you can run a bot over all the maps and find problems really. rather than runing game by game hoping to find something
2011-06-14T08:13:46  <guyverthree> uncleVasya thanks again
2011-06-14T08:14:14  <UncleVasya> guyverthree:  " ant at turn 50 turn 100"  -  I don't understant what you mean here.
2011-06-14T08:17:20  <guyverthree> uncleVasya: numbers of ants at turn 50, turn 100, turn 200
2011-06-14T08:17:47  <guyverthree> unclevasya so you could see maps that you found difficult to get started on
2011-06-14T08:17:49  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: You can see it in the replay for each game.
2011-06-14T08:19:41  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: If you see on the table bad result (small scores or even eliminated/timeouted), just launch replay for this game.
2011-06-14T08:20:56  <guyverthree> unclevasya that's cool
2011-06-14T08:21:09  <guyverthree> i take it zaphus made it
2011-06-14T08:21:49  <guyverthree> is the source avaible because multithreading it would be cool :)
2011-06-14T08:22:07  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: Delphi 2010
2011-06-14T08:22:24  <guyverthree> it's in delphi wicked
2011-06-14T08:22:25  <zaphus> guyverthree: I didnt make it, UncleVasya was just getting me to test that version - he's the genius behind it :-)
2011-06-14T08:23:00  <UncleVasya> So you can blame me for all bugs in it :)
2011-06-14T08:23:34  <guyverthree> blame is not something i like to give out
2011-06-14T08:24:18  <stocha> sir_macelon: okay i published my latest framework under the form of a jar.
2011-06-14T08:24:24  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: let's call it bugreports, suggestions and feedbacks :)
2011-06-14T08:25:05  <guyverthree> that i can do :)
2011-06-14T08:26:04  <stocha> https://github.com/stocha/antwars_Sample_Engine/tree/master/reference    all the stuff is there.
2011-06-14T08:26:43  <stocha> the engine jar is executable (if you double click on it, or java -jar it you should see some ant fighting on a random asymetric map)
2011-06-14T08:27:12  <stocha> i messed up the renaming so the bot directory i now present twice. i don't know how to delete the old one :p
2011-06-14T08:27:49  <zaphus> UncleVasya: Do you have a 32-bot limit ?   I have 34 and 2 are not showing :-)
2011-06-14T08:29:10  <UncleVasya> zaphus: Do they have a "Bot" in their names?
2011-06-14T08:29:12  <stocha> the .java are inside the jar as well as the .class
2011-06-14T08:29:19  <zaphus> nope
2011-06-14T08:30:24  <UncleVasya> I use masks to skip a trash:  *Bot*.exe , *Bot*.py  ,  *Bot*.jar
2011-06-14T08:30:53  <zaphus> oh, ok
2011-06-14T08:31:35  <zaphus> by chance my bots were all 'Zaphbot"  - but the new ones I just grabbed I called "Stocha" and "UncleVasya" etc
2011-06-14T08:34:07  *** berak <berak!~chatzilla@89.204.137.194> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-14T08:34:46  <UncleVasya> zaphus: Is my bot doing well against others in your local testing?
2011-06-14T08:34:52  <zaphus> Hmm - the UncleVasya bot crashed every single time, but all the others worked... I think your antstesting hates your own bot !
2011-06-14T08:35:23  <zaphus> hmm "Cannot exec ocamlrun"
2011-06-14T08:37:41  <UncleVasya> UncleVasya: I didn't know that OCaml is neededl to launch the binary. I'll ask Smiley about it when he comes.
2011-06-14T08:38:35  <olexs> ok, for the testing tool, where do I put the bots so it can see them? there's no path setting or anything
2011-06-14T08:40:49  <UncleVasya> olexs: anywhere in the folder that you selected.
2011-06-14T08:41:07  <olexs> so anywhere near the playgame.py?
2011-06-14T08:41:21  <UncleVasya> Just be sure your bot has a "Bot" in it's name.
2011-06-14T08:41:33  <olexs> yes, I saw that one :)
2011-06-14T08:41:40  <UncleVasya> yep.
2011-06-14T08:41:49  <UncleVasya> Subdirectories are ok too.
2011-06-14T08:42:52  <olexs> okay, now it works. thanks, that is pretty much what I was building :)
2011-06-14T08:42:59  <zaphus> UncleVasya:  I feel like the "scores" total should really be an average, especially since some bots play in more games than others (after the first 4)
2011-06-14T08:45:09  *** stocha <stocha!c2faade1@gateway/web/freenode/ip.194.250.173.225> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-06-14T08:45:12  <zaphus> interesting, if I do 100 turn games then Stocha wins pretty much every one of them... but at 1000 turns it's a different story (most of the time).     It's a very efficient food hunter, impressive!   and thats now going to be the baseline for any good bot since if you release the source
2011-06-14T08:46:17  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@ca60c171.ugent.be> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-14T08:46:58  <zaphus> UncleVasya:  Suggestion "map repeats" - which lets you run all the maps multiple times.  e.g. there are a small number of 4 maps, so I would like to repeat them several times (with different seeds I guess, so they play differently)
2011-06-14T08:46:59  <UncleVasya> zaphus: it's a delicate deal so I think we need to hear more thoughts about it. olexs:  What do you think about Scores statistic: total or average?
2011-06-14T08:47:21  <zaphus> remember that not all bots play the same number of games
2011-06-14T08:47:44  <olexs> UncleVasya: I need some more test runs to answer that properly, but I'm inclined towards average
2011-06-14T08:48:31  <zaphus> UncleVasya: how about "minimum bots" ?  so if I choose 8 bots I can tell it to only run maps of 8, I dont care about the 4's.  that or you need to do all permutations of players on the 4 maps to get all combinations
2011-06-14T08:49:11  *** locutus2 <locutus2!~locutus2@62.152.161.149> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)

2011-06-14T08:50:03  <UncleVasya> I added check box "only maps with this number of bots'. Is this what you are talking about?
2011-06-14T08:50:10  <zaphus> it's working well for me right now.   would probably like a column telling me how long each match took :-)  1000 turns takes a while
2011-06-14T08:50:35  <zaphus> UncleVasya: Yes, that would do it.   behaviour with that unchecked is odd, since it just chooses the first in your list and some miss out
2011-06-14T08:50:45  *** delt0r_ <delt0r_!~delt0r@188-22-175-176.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-14T08:52:49  <UncleVasya> zaphus: I thought about that too, but my app window is already big enough. I don't know what people here think about form with.
2011-06-14T08:53:26  <zaphus> yeah, probably right... can you do tooltips (hover over the map name, it tells you how long it took to run?)
2011-06-14T08:53:32  <UncleVasya> But I agree that column with a number of turns is would be great.
2011-06-14T08:54:01  <zaphus> I meant the physical time :-)   but number of turns is good too :-)
2011-06-14T08:55:05  <guyverthree> i cann't seem to get it work for me
2011-06-14T08:55:25  <olexs> the testing tool is brilliant, thanks a lot.
2011-06-14T08:56:03  <UncleVasya> zaphus:  I wrote "physical time" as a talk-with-you-later topic.
2011-06-14T08:56:18  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: I think you have an old environment.
2011-06-14T08:56:33  <UncleVasya> guyverthree: Yesterday tools.zip was updated.
2011-06-14T08:56:37  <guyverthree> unclevasya old enviroment ???
2011-06-14T08:56:49  <guyverthree> oh right
2011-06-14T08:57:16  <UncleVasya> guyverthree:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip
2011-06-14T08:57:19  <guyverthree> i'll get it and then run some tests :)
2011-06-14T08:57:58  <UncleVasya> olexs: your welcome.
2011-06-14T08:59:43  <guyverthree> excellent
2011-06-14T08:59:46  <guyverthree> it's amazing
2011-06-14T09:00:10  <zaphus> Hey guys, can you check what happens if you press stop on the antstesting tool ?  does it leave some bots running (use task manager to check)  - I think it does for me
2011-06-14T09:01:57  <olexs> zaphus: nope, works for me
2011-06-14T09:02:13  <olexs> wait
2011-06-14T09:02:19  <zaphus> olexs:  hmm, just checked it myself and there were processes left running
2011-06-14T09:02:21  <olexs> interesting
2011-06-14T09:02:33  <olexs> they were left running for a few more seconds, then dies
2011-06-14T09:02:35  <olexs> *died
2011-06-14T09:02:42  <zaphus> oh, I didnt wait :-)
2011-06-14T09:03:00  <UncleVasya> zaphus: Stop button doesn't stops current game.
2011-06-14T09:03:10  <zaphus> Ah, that would explain it
2011-06-14T09:03:13  <olexs> makes sense
2011-06-14T09:03:20  <UncleVasya> *"doesn't stop"?
2011-06-14T09:03:41  <zaphus> AntsTesting.exe uses 100% cpu, I doubt it needs to - it could be sleeping while the game is running
2011-06-14T09:04:41  <UncleVasya> zaphus: yeah, it was a problem that I solved in the wrong way.
2011-06-14T09:05:13  <guyverthree> right guys my lunch is over but thanks for the testing enviroment it's amamzing

2011-06-14T09:06:13  <UncleVasya> It's running endless loop of checking if game already ended. I think I can replace it with checking every 5 seconds.
2011-06-14T09:07:08  <zaphus> UncleVasya: even once a second would be thousands of times less processing

2011-06-14T09:23:24  <smiley1983> berak: I think you asked about the generator for the maps I was posting. You might have seen the link I posted already, but if not, the in-development source resides here: https://github.com/smiley1983/rotsym_mapgen
2011-06-14T09:24:01  <berak> didn't see that, so thanks for it now!
2011-06-14T09:24:15  <smiley1983> no worries :)
2011-06-14T09:24:28  <antimatroid> smiley1983: why no python?
2011-06-14T09:24:31  <antimatroid> it's really really simple
2011-06-14T09:24:36  <antimatroid> i learnt python doing map gens
2011-06-14T09:24:53  <antimatroid> i wish this exam would do itself :(
2011-06-14T09:26:10  <smiley1983> I've written stuff in Python so I guess I could... but I don't like it as much.
2011-06-14T09:26:27  <antimatroid> yeah i hate it
2011-06-14T09:26:33  <antimatroid> it's gross
2011-06-14T09:26:55  <smiley1983> also, it's just generating files based on some inputs, so I figured the language shouldn't matter...
2011-06-14T09:27:08  <smiley1983> and I'm very comfortable with thinking in OCaml
2011-06-14T09:27:18  <antimatroid> they want the codebase stuff to all be python
2011-06-14T09:27:29  <antimatroid> which is reasonable i guess, it would be nice that it's all one language
2011-06-14T09:27:39  <antimatroid> i would love to be able to just do stuff in c++ though
2011-06-14T09:27:51  <smiley1983> some of the tasks were not conceptually easy for me, so it was nice to work it out in a language which makes sense to me
2011-06-14T09:28:07  <antimatroid> yeah, i did map gens in c++ first
2011-06-14T09:28:24  <smiley1983> though the rotation and tiling logic is small - about 100 lines, and could be easily ported
2011-06-14T09:28:33  <berak>  ol := !ol @ !shortlist           // loooks, like ml is fun!
2011-06-14T09:28:40  <antimatroid> sigh and  amstan laughed at me prototyping in c++ :P
2011-06-14T09:28:56  <smiley1983> the large pile of functions I wrote for maze and cavern generation is about 500 lines, though
2011-06-14T09:29:28  <smiley1983> berak: yes, it lets you do all sorts of neat things in brief syntax without being slow
2011-06-14T09:29:50  <smiley1983> assuming you don't ask it to do things which are inherently slow :)
2011-06-14T09:31:03  <antimatroid> i'm curious about food collection now
2011-06-14T09:31:40  <antimatroid> a1k0n seemed to think it might be possible to collect food with updating availability information with a single pass of the map with some cleaning up every time one collects something
2011-06-14T09:32:37  <smiley1983> if it's possible, I would like to know how :)
2011-06-14T09:34:32  <smiley1983> obviously subsequent bfs searches can be building upon one initial search from multiple searches, but I don't see how you can avoid performing those subsequent updates
2011-06-14T09:34:57  <smiley1983> search from multiple sources, sorry
2011-06-14T09:35:25  <smiley1983> problem with typing long messages into a single line
2011-06-14T09:35:43  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: Do another people need something to run compiled to the binary program in ocaml? Some of them get "Cannot exec ocamlrun" error while trying to launch it.
2011-06-14T09:36:06  <smiley1983> they are possibly compiling bytecode?
2011-06-14T09:36:13  <smiley1983> use ocamlopt, not ocamlc
2011-06-14T09:36:26  <smiley1983> or ocamlbuild, I think that uses ocamlopt by default
2011-06-14T09:36:46  <olexs> use a multi-seed bfs with all visible food as seeds, update ants as unavailable and food as taken on a found match, stop when all food or all ants are done
2011-06-14T09:36:47  <smiley1983> By default, ocaml binaries are statically linked, with some special exceptions
2011-06-14T09:37:24  <antimatroid> smiley1983: yeah i agree
2011-06-14T09:37:35  <antimatroid> once exams are over i'm going to write two slightly different bots
2011-06-14T09:37:47  <smiley1983> olexs: recording all of that information and then looking it up?
2011-06-14T09:37:52  <antimatroid> one using my normal bfs food collection, then another using my new a* with multiple targets, see which one is faster
2011-06-14T09:38:21  <smiley1983> I think it might be able to determine which one to apply in some situations with heuristics :)
2011-06-14T09:38:31  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-14T09:38:43  <olexs> smiley1983: you have all visible food and available ants info as input on a turn, the "availability" can be tracked as boolean map
2011-06-14T09:38:47  <antimatroid> but first i need to work out what the differences are like for different states
2011-06-14T09:39:14  <antimatroid> olexs: my food collection is more complicated than that
2011-06-14T09:39:45  <antimatroid> i have an availibility map for locations, ants start as available at 0, then when i collect food, that food location becomes available at some time, along with the adjacent target square of my sourced nat
2011-06-14T09:39:46  <antimatroid> ant*
2011-06-14T09:39:57  <smiley1983> okay, but for the bfs - is it recording the distance of every source to every target?
2011-06-14T09:39:57  <CIA-79> aichallenge: aerique epsilon * r7bdbcc0 / ants/test_bot.sh : Replace --seed with --engine_seed and --player_seed. - http://bit.ly/iEnKND
2011-06-14T09:40:01  <antimatroid> then i need to start searching from all non-collected foor items again with the new availability information
2011-06-14T09:40:18  <antimatroid> smiley1983: was that to me?
2011-06-14T09:40:25  <smiley1983> no sorry, to olexs
2011-06-14T09:40:39  <antimatroid> bfs search doesn't need to know the distance to a target, it just searches out until it finds a target
2011-06-14T09:41:11  <smiley1983> _a_ target - but sometimes the first target you find is not the one you want
2011-06-14T09:41:11  <olexs> smiley: not directly. it is tracking the source for every expanded node; that way when an ant is found, the source is marked as taken
2011-06-14T09:41:38  <smiley1983> ah, you mark it during the search?
2011-06-14T09:41:51  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: Also I have a question about OCaml itself.  I want to do following in my bot  1. Save a copy of my current game state  (for example, under the name state_backup)  2.  Make processing of current state changing it a lot.  3. discard changes with current game state restoring it from the backup_state.
2011-06-14T09:41:57  <olexs> if you start at all food sources at once, the first match you find is the shortest ant-food distance, so you want it
2011-06-14T09:42:28  <olexs> yes, I mark availability and send ants directly during the search
2011-06-14T09:42:57  <olexs> of course, that does not take into account things as walking into enemy ants and so, that needs to be cheched as well, but that's a different story
2011-06-14T09:43:13  <smiley1983> yes, that makes sense :)
2011-06-14T09:44:01  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: am I right in thinking you want to be able to process this game state as a text file?
2011-06-14T09:44:03  <olexs> mind you, my bot doesn't yet use that, I need to rewrite some code to make it work - at the moment it's way simpler...
2011-06-14T09:44:34  <UncleVasya> smiley1983:  no.
2011-06-14T09:45:11  <UncleVasya> I'll try ti explain with example.
2011-06-14T09:45:15  <UncleVasya> *to
2011-06-14T09:45:44  <smiley1983> okay... one option is to use the input format, write some simple matching output functions, and use text files
2011-06-14T09:46:12  <smiley1983> I think there is some sort of state-saving library as well, let me go and look...
2011-06-14T09:47:32  <smiley1983> Yes, the standard set of modules includes Marshal, which can save the whole game state and load it automagically
2011-06-14T09:48:58  <smiley1983> Marshal.to_channel ochan state extern_flags
2011-06-14T09:49:02  <UncleVasya> In your starter package all info about game stores in the object whith name state. It contains map, lists of food and ants and methods to deal with it.
2011-06-14T09:50:15  <UncleVasya> I need make some changes (add or remove ants from the lists, change map cells, etc).
2011-06-14T09:50:35  <smiley1983> yes, I'm just reading about that, I'm not sure if it can marshal objects, which is a deficiency
2011-06-14T09:51:14  <UncleVasya> And then I want to easily discard all these changes.
2011-06-14T09:51:31  <smiley1983> However, if you change the Ant object to a record and write some functions to deal with that record to replace its methods, then you can marshal gstate
2011-06-14T09:51:46  <antimatroid> I can pass my game state an input file stream containing a game state and it will take input from it :)
2011-06-14T09:51:51  <antimatroid> c++ starter bot ftw
2011-06-14T09:52:06  <antimatroid> just is an ifstream if, and if >> state;
2011-06-14T09:52:15  <antimatroid> ifs*, if is a bad name :P
2011-06-14T09:52:16  <smiley1983> yes, this could too, which is why I'm thinking text files are the way to go
2011-06-14T09:52:59  <smiley1983> if you write some output functions which match the input format, you can save and load game states without any other changes in the souce
2011-06-14T09:53:14  <smiley1983> *source
2011-06-14T09:53:48  <antimatroid> just write everything you read to an output stream before processing :P
2011-06-14T09:54:06  <smiley1983> that's a good point :)
2011-06-14T09:54:12  <smiley1983> much easier :)
2011-06-14T09:54:30  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: Is dealing with files allowed on the server?
2011-06-14T09:54:42  <antimatroid> i'd be tempted to write the output function still :P
2011-06-14T09:54:56  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: you can read from files but not write
2011-06-14T09:54:57  <smiley1983> I think you can read from existing data files, but cannot write anything to them
2011-06-14T09:55:22  <antimatroid> the ranking system could deal with bots of varying level
2011-06-14T09:55:26  <antimatroid> for one thing
2011-06-14T09:55:31  <antimatroid> couldn't*
2011-06-14T09:55:31  <antimatroid>  :P
2011-06-14T09:55:58  <smiley1983> Actually, when I tried to get my letterbot to read from a font file, it wouldn't do it, even in local testing.
2011-06-14T09:56:11  <UncleVasya> So the only way to go is to change atns to the record?
2011-06-14T09:56:28  <smiley1983> no, there's a much easier way
2011-06-14T09:56:40  <smiley1983> log the input it sends you for the turn
2011-06-14T09:57:07  <antimatroid> you are welcome to read from files locally for training your bot of course
2011-06-14T09:57:13  <smiley1983> Read it again, and you have the correct state
2011-06-14T09:57:19  <antimatroid> but any parameters for that kind of thing need to be trained locally
2011-06-14T09:57:47  <UncleVasya> log? But I can not write into the files...
2011-06-14T09:57:55  <smiley1983> locally
2011-06-14T09:57:57  <antimatroid> you can locally
2011-06-14T09:58:05  <antimatroid> just not on the server
2011-06-14T09:58:10  <smiley1983> you should be able to, let me test...
2011-06-14T09:58:22  <antimatroid> you can train against other bots on tcp with your local bot too
2011-06-14T09:58:28  <antimatroid> so you aren't restricted to training on your own bots
2011-06-14T09:58:49  <UncleVasya> I think I failed to explain what I really need :(
2011-06-14T09:59:02  <antimatroid> what do you want to do?
2011-06-14T10:00:36  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: you can't help here. it is an OCaml specific question.I
2011-06-14T10:01:26  <smiley1983> okay, if you describe it again I'll try to understand :)
2011-06-14T10:03:20  <UncleVasya> I'll try to do it next time I'll meet you. I need a time to find words.
2011-06-14T10:03:46  <smiley1983> Okay, just wait, I've reread the above, I think I might understand...

2011-06-14T10:03:53  <smiley1983> let me ask a few questions to see...
2011-06-14T10:04:29  <smiley1983> are you asking how to make the changes you mentioned above to the data structures? Adding ants and so on?
2011-06-14T10:04:35  <smiley1983> And then how to discard them?
2011-06-14T10:04:41  <UncleVasya> Go ahead.
2011-06-14T10:04:48  <UncleVasya> Yes.
2011-06-14T10:04:58  <smiley1983> Right, sorry, I misunderstood completely
2011-06-14T10:05:20  <smiley1983> I thought you were asking how to do processing of the game states separate from the actual game, using files
2011-06-14T10:05:24  <smiley1983> let me try to answer:
2011-06-14T10:05:24  <UncleVasya> map array is mutable so changes are affecting it even outside of let... in..  block
2011-06-14T10:05:31  <smiley1983> yes
2011-06-14T10:05:37  <smiley1983> you need to copy the map
2011-06-14T10:05:51  <UncleVasya> Yes.
2011-06-14T10:05:54  <smiley1983> specifically, you need to copy both dimensions of the map
2011-06-14T10:06:18  <UncleVasya> I need to make a loop?
2011-06-14T10:06:19  <smiley1983> let me find an example in the code...
2011-06-14T10:06:28  <smiley1983> no, there is a more elegant way
2011-06-14T10:07:16  <smiley1983> oh, there isn't an example in the starter, let me paste it somewhere
2011-06-14T10:08:41  <smiley1983> let copy_matrix m = Array.map (Array.map (fun x -> x)) m;;
2011-06-14T10:09:22  <smiley1983> I can explain if it doesn't make sense :)
2011-06-14T10:09:56  <smiley1983> that's for the map
2011-06-14T10:10:02  <smiley1983> it won't copy the whole state
2011-06-14T10:11:01  <smiley1983> do you know about the {state with map = new_map} syntax?
2011-06-14T10:11:30  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-590c4c11.pool.mediaWays.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-14T10:11:58  <smiley1983> you can make a new tgame_state with new copies of the mutable elements
2011-06-14T10:12:35  <smiley1983> I think that includes all the lists and the array, unfortunately

2011-06-14T10:17:54  <smiley1983> it's just a special property of arrays that they're mutable internally, lists are only mutable if you make them mutable lists or list refereces :)
2011-06-14T10:18:31  <UncleVasya> My attempts to make a copy of array returned only a references to the same array with another name. But the independent copy is the thing I really needed. Thank you!
2011-06-14T10:18:41  <smiley1983> So you can get a copy of the game state with:
2011-06-14T10:19:12  <smiley1983> let new_state = {state with tmap = new_tmap} in ...

2011-06-14T11:08:16  <smiley1983> much faster, too - ocamlc generates un-optimized bytecode like Python :)
2011-06-14T11:08:46  <smiley1983> not quite as inefficient as Python's, though, because you can do proper iteration without generating lists of numbers :)
2011-06-14T11:10:09  <UncleVasya> ocamlopt with the same keys? -c -c -o?

2011-06-14T11:32:57  <antimatroid> possibly with some bots on the main server that can be paired up in games if there is a long enough wait for external bots
2011-06-14T11:33:07  <antimatroid> with at least one external bot requesting a game of course
2011-06-14T11:33:11  <smiley1983> they could run both, with the server-side games being "fairer" but with results coming through more slowly
2011-06-14T11:33:23  <smiley1983> both tcp and server-only, that is
2011-06-14T11:33:25  <berak> most important: it needs a server.
2011-06-14T11:33:58  <antimatroid> if we had a server, i'd be inclined to cap the number of games a bot will be given
2011-06-14T11:34:01  <berak> so, could you all look under your bed ?
2011-06-14T11:34:14  <antimatroid> it can still be paired for games for a bot needing more games, but after a certain point the server stops giving games to bots
2011-06-14T11:34:26  <antimatroid> so we aren't constantly churning through games for all the old games

2011-06-14T11:35:33  <antimatroid> atm i'm pretty sure the matching algorithm does something like that, finds the bot with the least number of games then picks an opponent for it
2011-06-14T11:36:04  <antimatroid> and the picking of an opponent isn't just random obviously, depends on the skill level of the bot

2011-06-14T11:37:28  <antimatroid> actually, i think there's some big problems with that
2011-06-14T11:37:48  <antimatroid> after a while it should be something like the bot with the longest average time between games
2011-06-14T11:37:50  <amstan> @seen janzert
2011-06-14T11:37:50  <contestbot> amstan: janzert was last seen in #aichallenge 12 hours, 22 minutes, and 29 seconds ago: <janzert> ok, empathy is a really bad irc client
2011-06-14T11:37:58  <antimatroid> amstan: he's out of town for 2 days
2011-06-14T11:38:09  <amstan> ok
2011-06-14T11:38:20  <antimatroid> having said that, he came online after that
2011-06-14T11:38:26  <antimatroid> and said the above
2011-06-14T11:38:40  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, that's why i was wondering
2011-06-14T11:53:16  <smiley1983> amstan: rules question: can I include GPL library code with my bot if I release my source after the contest, or does it have to be LGPL (or is library code not allowed)?
2011-06-14T11:54:22  <amstan> smiley1983: well.. the rule with gpl is that if you statically link it in your code, and someone gets the binary, the person who has the binary must also get the source
2011-06-14T11:54:44  <amstan> so.. your code should be gpl, but...
2011-06-14T11:54:57  <amstan> you only have to provide the source to the ppl getting the binary
2011-06-14T11:55:06  <amstan> and that's only us(the contest organizers)
2011-06-14T11:55:17  <smiley1983> so if my code is gpl, that seems okay :)
2011-06-14T11:56:02  <smiley1983> Thankyou for pointing out the part about mine needing to be GPL as well, though, I need to relicense my mapgen from bsd to gpl
2011-06-14T11:57:14  <amstan> smiley1983: depends on how you link the library
2011-06-14T11:57:52  <amstan> from what i know, if you're statically linking it the license gets inhereted, for dynamic linking(so, dll) it doesn't
2011-06-14T11:59:51  <smiley1983> the original library is actually lgpl, but in order to remove a component I believe it's necessary to change it to gpl, so in order to avoid redistributing the whole of mathlib in order to use one tiny part, I've done the license swap

2011-06-14T12:00:21  <smiley1983> so technically, in order to be in strict obedience, my code should be the same
2011-06-14T12:00:41  <amstan> ugh... we also don't really care

2011-06-14T12:01:14  <amstan> the rules don't really specify anything about code

2011-06-14T13:29:36  <UncleVasya> Vioo: maybe "compile" isn't a right word. You need to make jre-file from your bot sources.
2011-06-14T13:30:01  <UncleVasya> Vioo: I am not familiar with java. I did it this way:
2011-06-14T13:31:06  <UncleVasya> 1. Made an empty java project in NetBeans. 2. Add bot's sources to the project. 3. Pressed Build.
2011-06-14T13:31:25  <UncleVasya> I've got a jar-file in the project directory after that.
2011-06-14T13:32:03  <UncleVasya> But I think you do not really need NetBeans and can do it with command line.
