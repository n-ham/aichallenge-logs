2011-10-03T10:44:45  <UncleVasya> And I always get biggest profit from cleaning :(
2011-10-03T10:45:16  <mcstar> i think its called refactoring?
2011-10-03T10:45:36  <mcstar> maybe you didnt refactor, only cleaned up the code
2011-10-03T10:45:53  <mcstar> its necessary indeed
2011-10-03T10:46:22  <UncleVasya> no, no. I am not good enough to care about code culture.
2011-10-03T10:46:41  <mcstar> my problem is a lack of time, but more importantly a lack of ideas regarding implementation
2011-10-03T10:46:54  <UncleVasya> Just spent few days in looking for:
2011-10-03T10:47:09  <UncleVasya> 1. lost brackets in formulas.
2011-10-03T10:47:56  <UncleVasya> 2. values that I clear to 0 but trying to use them later.
2011-10-03T10:49:01  <mcstar> i dont even understand those issues
2011-10-03T10:50:35  <UncleVasya> 1.  a == b && c > a || z <= y
2011-10-03T10:51:18  <UncleVasya> 2. c = b + a ;  ....    c = 0 ;   ....    z = c + y ;
2011-10-03T10:52:06  <mcstar> 1: i dont see brackets there
2011-10-03T10:52:16  <UncleVasya> 2nd was when I decided to store some info between turns but forgot to edit clear_state function.
2011-10-03T10:52:39  <mcstar> 2: i dont myself running into problems with variable initialization
2011-10-03T10:52:46  <UncleVasya> mcstar: because they lost. I forgot them and value is incorrect.
2011-10-03T10:53:06  <mcstar> maybe thats because lisp is more like a functional language and you think in terms of bindings
2011-10-03T10:53:19  <mcstar> UncleVasya: they arent lost
2011-10-03T10:53:23  <mcstar> you didnt write them
2011-10-03T10:53:47  <UncleVasya> ok :)
2011-10-03T10:53:56  <mcstar> i dont find*
2011-10-03T10:54:18  <UncleVasya> I think it's because of lack in experience of coding. Also I think it is temporary condition.
2011-10-03T10:54:54  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i hope you now appreciate why some people prefer prefix notation
2011-10-03T10:55:05  <mcstar> there are no precedence rules
2011-10-03T10:56:25  <mcstar> anyway, to issue 1: i think many tutorials on common languages encourage the newcomers to use parantheses extensively
2011-10-03T11:01:10  <UncleVasya> mcstar: What is your MusicAlbum-2011?
2011-10-03T11:01:40  <mcstar> sorry?
2011-10-03T11:02:08  <mcstar> is $name == "MusicAlbum-2011"
2011-10-03T11:02:11  <mcstar> ?

2011-10-03T11:09:13  <UncleVasya> It's a game of the month.
2011-10-03T11:10:27  <mcstar> yeah, nice, the new scoring system only takes razed hills into account

2011-10-03T11:16:11  <UncleVasya> it already can't win if game guted off.

2011-10-03T11:19:12  <smiley1983> yes, that program has various problems, suicide being one of the more embarrassing ones :)
2011-10-03T11:19:39  <smiley1983> sorry about the slow response, I left the window open without looking at it for several days
2011-10-03T11:20:30  <mcstar> arent you worried of flies coming into the house?
2011-10-03T11:20:39  <UncleVasya> Few days ago I've read Readme for the starter pack. And saw idea with simultanious search.
2011-10-03T11:21:36  <UncleVasya> I've never thought about this before. And I think I'd never thought without your readme. Thanks, I'm implementing it right now :)
2011-10-03T11:21:56  <smiley1983> I'm not bothering to fix the current solifugid entry. The ideas at its core were experiments, and I now have a new set of ideas to implement using some of the same functions
2011-10-03T11:22:10  <smiley1983> Was that from my readme? I'm glad I included it then :)
2011-10-03T11:22:38  <smiley1983> I wondered afterwards if the readme was going to be of any use, so I'm glad there was at least one worthwhile idea in there
2011-10-03T11:23:23  <UncleVasya> Don't you angry because I began use your pack long time ago and only now checked readme?

2011-10-03T13:52:54  <medrimonia> mcstar: Hmmm in fact, it's not exactly how is stopping the actual GameEngine the games that I want to know. It's just to know if when you've got a lot more ants than your opponents, you have to capture the enemy hills in order to avoid draw.
2011-10-03T13:54:33  <mcstar> score is determined by razed hills, yes
2011-10-03T13:54:48  <medrimonia> yep that I know
2011-10-03T13:55:08  <medrimonia> But for now, I'm not really thinking about the hills
2011-10-03T13:56:01  <medrimonia> But in games like that : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=10579&user=64
2011-10-03T13:56:13  <medrimonia> I can't understand how it end in a draw anticipated.
2011-10-03T13:56:23  <mcstar> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/specification.php
2011-10-03T13:56:35  <mcstar> have you seen this? i think thats the most detailed description there is
2011-10-03T13:56:59  <medrimonia> "If a game consists of a dominant ant that isn't killing of the opponent or razing enemy hills, then the game is cutoff. It is assumed that the bot would probably not lose the lead and just isn't sophisticated enough to go in for the kill. If the total amount of live ants for the dominant bot is 90% of the count of food and ants for 150 turns then the cutoff is invoked."
2011-10-03T13:57:14  <mcstar> yeah, sounds bad, at least the first part
2011-10-03T13:57:47  <medrimonia> In fact, I thought that this was supposed to end the game with the dominant ant winning
2011-10-03T13:57:53  <mcstar> otherwise, i cant help you, at this time im not interested in en game conditions or cut offs
2011-10-03T13:58:02  <mcstar> end*

2011-10-03T15:56:44  <contestbot> McLeopold: I think that worked...
2011-10-03T15:57:25  <janzert> razing doesn't reset it now?
2011-10-03T15:57:41  <janzert> I agree it should though

2011-10-03T15:57:57  <McLeopold> and a bot elimination as well?
2011-10-03T15:58:17  <McLeopold> My though is the perfect cutoff time should be the max distance between any 2 hills
2011-10-03T15:58:25  <janzert> not sure on elimination either way
2011-10-03T15:58:58  <McLeopold> ok, I'll at least implement the raze piece
2011-10-03T15:59:43  <janzert> I assume elimination is basically the only thing that resets it now?

2011-10-03T16:08:05  <janzert> looks like for Erlang I'm going to need to extend the vglobs concept to look for a filename matching the input filename but with a different extension
2011-10-03T16:08:14  <janzert> instead of just looking for a specific file
2011-10-03T16:08:52  <janzert> hopefully I can get that done tonight
