2011-12-23T00:00:04  <BenJackson> Scryer: anyway, good reminder that it's the journey, not the destination
2011-12-23T00:01:32  <BenJackson> sigmas are low enough now it hardly matters what the game outcome is
2011-12-23T00:02:22  <BenJackson> wow pguillory and I both botched his hill in the last game
2011-12-23T00:02:39  <BenJackson> we both abandoned it :)

2011-12-23T00:03:05  <Kettling> BenJackson: actually it was a really good comp, there were probably about 4000 or 5000 entries that had some respectable work put into them. I wish I got into it sooner
2011-12-23T00:03:41  <Kettling> You think only 3000 real entries?
2011-12-23T00:03:55  <BenJackson> well, go to page 30 of the rankings
2011-12-23T00:03:57  <BenJackson> watch a few games
2011-12-23T00:04:01  <BenJackson> I thought those were starters
2011-12-23T00:04:21  <BenJackson> behavior at 2000 is clearly different, I was guessing tutorial because I saw 8 player games near 2000 where everyone did basically the same (non-starter) thing
2011-12-23T00:05:30  <pguillory> BenJackson: ouch that one hurt to watch
2011-12-23T00:06:55  <Scryer> BJ doesn't see PG's hill, though, does he? Or is that one you figure out by symmetry or "intuited ants"?
2011-12-23T00:07:14  <BenJackson> no, I don't think I saw it, but I didn't check
2011-12-23T00:08:31  <Kettling> Yeah, now I look at the ones around 2500 there are heaps of bugs in there. OK, I'll call it 2000 real entries
2011-12-23T00:09:43  <thestinger> BenJackson: the tutorial logic is pretty good
2011-12-23T00:09:48  <thestinger> but it doesn't have pathfinding
2011-12-23T00:10:13  <thestinger> it basically does 'gather food' -> 'attack hills' -> 'explore' with all non-idle ants
2011-12-23T00:10:33  <thestinger> so it doesn't cover explored area, but it's somewhat sane
2011-12-23T00:10:42  <BenJackson> I didn't do the tutorial
2011-12-23T00:11:00  <thestinger> I did - I started in python and I just decided to do it
2011-12-23T00:11:02  <BenJackson> but what I observed when I looked was such similar behavior it's hard to attribute that to a pattern among people who were obviously new at this
2011-12-23T00:11:04  <thestinger> I regret starting in python though
2011-12-23T00:11:37  <thestinger> wasted a few weeks trying to get it fast
2011-12-23T00:11:49  <thestinger> I considered using haskell but the ghc version was ancient - so I ended up having to learn c++ :P
2011-12-23T00:12:00  <Kettling> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=323419&user=1204
2011-12-23T00:12:09  <Kettling> That's a simple but effective strategy
2011-12-23T00:12:35  <thestinger> Kettling: when I first started, I uploaded a tutorial bot with pathfinding (in python)
2011-12-23T00:12:39  <thestinger> got to the top 100
2011-12-23T00:12:45  <BenJackson> that's awesome
2011-12-23T00:12:46  <thestinger> it would probably be around rank 300-500 now
2011-12-23T00:12:53  <BenJackson> I mean Kettling's post
2011-12-23T00:12:56  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-23T00:13:05  <thestinger> simple strategy can be very effective though

2011-12-23T00:15:09  <BenJackson> oh right, greedybot times out
2011-12-23T00:15:09  <thestinger> greedybot just has serious timeout issues
2011-12-23T00:15:13  <thestinger> it should be higher :P

2011-12-23T00:16:28  <BenJackson> fail % way down now that we're in the top 1000
2011-12-23T00:16:48  <thestinger> does fail % mean an incomplete game?
2011-12-23T00:16:57  <_flag> runevision is an interesting entry -- pretty much the only top entry that I don't at least recognize
2011-12-23T00:16:58  <thestinger> like, 'ants not razing hills', etc.
2011-12-23T00:17:33  <BenJackson> huh
2011-12-23T00:17:38  <thestinger> http://blog.runevision.com/
2011-12-23T00:17:47  <BenJackson> I almost wonder if the right strategy was to optimize for these lopsided games
2011-12-23T00:17:56  <BenJackson> when someone dives on my hill and loses theirs they place ahead of me
2011-12-23T00:18:18  <amstan_> aww, so he's not related to runescape
2011-12-23T00:18:44  <_flag> thesinger: Wow, he's written a lot
2011-12-23T00:18:54  <_flag> I really need to get to work :)
2011-12-23T00:20:06  <Kettling> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=317868&user=12304
2011-12-23T00:20:33  <thestinger> his goals thing is quite similar to my bot, but I never got it working right for defense/boundaries
2011-12-23T00:20:37  <Kettling> There's a basic greedy algorithm without the timeouts and just spreads by diffusion (perhaps some anti-clumping system as well)
2011-12-23T00:20:41  <BenJackson> runevision> Sometimes, however - sometimes an idea turns out to be a significant improvement. By significant I mean that the new version consistently beat the previous version - as in 10 out of 10 times. Those times when I've managed to make such an improvement have been the most satisfying moments of this competition.
2011-12-23T00:20:45  <BenJackson> I agree with that
2011-12-23T00:21:09  <Kettling> Does well for growth, no combat smarts, and no aggresion
2011-12-23T00:22:46  <thestinger> lol, my last game increased my by 0.04, the one before was -0.04

2011-12-23T03:22:57  <BenJackson> I thikn my final place is going to come down to whatever happens in the last game or two
2011-12-23T03:23:01  <BenJackson> because the skills are so tight
2011-12-23T03:23:13  <BenJackson> but maybe the moves will be super small by then

2011-12-23T03:30:57  <hacklash> I've noticed something weird about the server playing games. One bot which looks like it should be playing better than the starter bot(http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=9974) is actually ranked lower than a starter bot(http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=1818  for example)  but it doesn't look like either will be playing any more games. Why did this happen? Is it the effect of timeouts?

2011-12-23T03:39:24  <amstan> hacklash: it depends on how that bot is playing
2011-12-23T03:39:39  <amstan> hacklash: if he sucks at defending his hill, he would be ranked lower than starter bots
2011-12-23T03:40:19  <hacklash> wait, why? Starter bots don't defend their own hill at all either
2011-12-23T03:42:38  <Belerafon_L> thestinger: who are you there?
2011-12-23T03:43:08  <amstan> hacklash: perhaps they did better in that regard somehow than this bot
2011-12-23T03:44:00  <hacklash> are you sure it isn't the fact that he times out sometimes?
2011-12-23T03:44:42  <hacklash> what i mean is, isn't timing out probably a larger factor?
2011-12-23T03:44:55  <amstan> maybe
2011-12-23T03:45:01  <amstan> i think you get a penality if you timeout
2011-12-23T03:45:17  <hacklash> in the ranking algorithm?
2011-12-23T03:45:27  <amstan> since starter bots don't time out so often on normal maps, he would be ranked lower
2011-12-23T03:46:12  <hacklash> ok, this makes what I was trying to do harder ....
2011-12-23T03:46:56  <hacklash> I wanted to figure out how many people competed with a bot of their own creation and not just the starter bot, hmmmmm
2011-12-23T03:47:24  <amstan> mcleopold has looked into that
2011-12-23T03:47:32  <thestinger> Belerafon_L: strcat
2011-12-23T03:47:32  <amstan> he can get you a list of hashes of the bots
2011-12-23T03:47:51  <hacklash> ooh.ok cool. you can do this because you can see the source right?
2011-12-23T03:48:04  <amstan> yes
2011-12-23T03:48:16  <hacklash> that would be cool. How should i get that from him?
2011-12-23T03:48:19  <amstan> hacklash: ask him in a few days, he might be able to help you
2011-12-23T03:48:42  <hacklash> thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
2011-12-23T03:50:05  <Belerafon_L> thestinger: normal battle, nothing wrong...
2011-12-23T03:50:42  <hacklash> Also, I was interested in doing some meta-analysis of the contest. What is the etiquette on scraping the website? Or is there a better way to get the info?
2011-12-23T03:51:13  <amstan> hacklash: we'll try keeping it archived
2011-12-23T03:51:18  <amstan> hacklash: the source code is also open
2011-12-23T03:51:38  <amstan> hacklash: if you're nice, i can probably get you sql queries executed
2011-12-23T03:51:43  <amstan> on the database
2011-12-23T03:52:17  <amstan> hacklash: unfortunatelly i can't give you access to the bots themselves, that's up to the bot owners
2011-12-23T03:52:57  <hacklash> could i get a copy of the database after the contest is over? i only want game results, replays, and final rankings
2011-12-23T03:53:19  <amstan> if you can get me sql queries to copy only the stuff you need, sure
2011-12-23T03:53:23  <hacklash> running sql queries would work ...
2011-12-23T03:53:32  <hacklash> ok
2011-12-23T03:53:39  <amstan> as for replays.. they're all available through http
2011-12-23T03:53:54  <amstan> but you'll have to wait for the sql for a list of them
2011-12-23T03:53:55  <hacklash> i'll do some tinkering with the server code on my local machine
2011-12-23T03:54:30  <hacklash> and see if I can make some sql queries
2011-12-23T03:54:34  <hacklash> thanks
2011-12-23T03:57:46  <hacklash> is a message through irc the best way to get ahold of you and McLeopold, or could I email you?
2011-12-23T03:58:23  <hacklash> not that I have either of your email addresses ...

2011-12-23T04:47:17  <teapot_moxian> funny that they didn't take your hills

2011-12-23T04:49:23  <thestinger> anyway my defense screwed me over on that map
2011-12-23T04:49:33  <thestinger> all those enemies close to the hill at the start stopped foragers from being sent out
2011-12-23T04:49:47  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=332705&user=757 here too, timeout but didn't really loose much... it seems that my time checker failed, before timing out i was hitting 450ms, maybe i left too little time for end phase (20ms)
2011-12-23T04:50:05  <thestinger> end phase is printing out orders?

2011-12-23T04:52:48  <Fluxid> https://github.com/fluxid/flantob/blob/master/src/flantob/game.py#L335 no, i leave about 30ms but combat could still could "spike" at the end, taking more time than predicted
2011-12-23T04:52:56  <thestinger> time.sleep(0.01)
2011-12-23T04:53:14  <Fluxid> daaaaamn, why not 0.001
2011-12-23T04:53:56  <thestinger> when I was using a timer (to use up the whole turn) I was still getting timeouts occasionally due to output
2011-12-23T04:54:03  <thestinger> even with 50ms to output orders
2011-12-23T04:54:04  <Fluxid> i didn't even think to look at engine code, i could make the time margin more dynamic
2011-12-23T04:54:23  <Fluxid> oh well
2011-12-23T04:54:40  <Fluxid> i won't be high in rankings anyway so it doesn't matter
2011-12-23T04:54:49  <Fluxid> around 70th
2011-12-23T04:55:02  <Fluxid> uh, 80th
2011-12-23T04:55:33  <thestinger> I lost :(
2011-12-23T04:55:46  <thestinger> my dropped 0.01, but sigma also dropped 0.01 so... I gained skill
2011-12-23T04:55:56  <thestinger> I guess the rankings will be pretty much frozen soon
2011-12-23T04:55:58  <Fluxid> i'm surprised how different ranking is from what it was before finals... but i probably shouldn't be
2011-12-23T04:56:39  <thestinger> Fluxid: I got to rank 11-15 (stable in that range) about a week before the finals
2011-12-23T04:56:53  <Fluxid> and now ~30?
2011-12-23T04:56:59  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-23T04:57:01  <thestinger> 30-40
2011-12-23T04:57:21  <Fluxid> also, wtf, nick i don't know from before... runevision?
2011-12-23T04:57:30  <thestinger> yeah, and he has a blog
2011-12-23T04:57:40  <thestinger> http://blog.runevision.com/
2011-12-23T04:58:31  <thestinger> professional game engine developer :)
2011-12-23T04:58:37  <Fluxid> i know most nicks but runevision is new to me
2011-12-23T04:58:38  <thestinger> so... yeah
2011-12-23T04:58:55  <Fluxid> but still, Memetix is my favourite player
2011-12-23T04:59:07  <thestinger> _flag!
2011-12-23T04:59:13  <thestinger> he killed me so many times on tcp
2011-12-23T04:59:18  <Fluxid> flag is awesome too
2011-12-23T04:59:23  <Fluxid> those must be geniuses
2011-12-23T04:59:55  <thestinger> http://runevision.com/cv/ yeah, lots of experience with this stuff
2011-12-23T05:00:03  <Fluxid> flag is 16, and memetix is a psychoterapist and learned java just to code pacman bot and ant bot
2011-12-23T05:00:15  <Fluxid> fucking awesome
2011-12-23T05:00:17  <thestinger> lol, yeah
2011-12-23T05:00:50  <thestinger> I wish I started programming earlier
2011-12-23T05:01:59  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-12-23T05:04:14  <thestinger> I also hadn't noticed teapotahedron before the finals
2011-12-23T05:05:13  <thestinger> Kurnevsky, wg_ash, crispy, r40n, WildUtah, T_and_B, mahrz, etc.
2011-12-23T05:05:24  <thestinger> lots of new names I haven't seen before near the top
2011-12-23T05:05:37  <thestinger> well
2011-12-23T05:05:41  <thestinger> those are the C++11 rankings
2011-12-23T05:05:43  <thestinger> xD
2011-12-23T05:05:52  <thestinger> whoops...
2011-12-23T05:06:35  <thestinger> thought something crazy happened, but it was just my brain being silly

2011-12-23T05:24:43  <Surya> Janzert : I don't know if it's easy to implement, but for the next contest, it could be interesting to have performance info about user like : "Average computation time per game - Average of the max turn memory used per game" and stuff like that.
2011-12-23T05:25:52  <Surya> I know a friend who goes up to 500 mo per game. He said the spec say no more than Xgo so he didn't care about finding the leak!
2011-12-23T05:26:09  <janzert> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2066 watch that profile, it's his lucky day ;)
2011-12-23T05:26:41  <Surya> The "I know a friend" sounds a lot like I'm talking about me, but I'm really not :)
2011-12-23T05:27:02  <Surya> Yeah, cutoff is like Damocles sword, but he stays alive :)
2011-12-23T05:27:41  <janzert> he just got bumped up into the top 1000 and had only 59 games so is now getting caught up to the 85 games everyone else in top 1000 has
2011-12-23T05:27:58  <janzert> so long as he keeps winning them at least
2011-12-23T05:28:03  <Surya> hehe
2011-12-23T05:28:13  <Surya> Btw, is there a new cutoff stage scheduled?
2011-12-23T05:28:32  <janzert> yep, it will start pretty soon here
2011-12-23T05:28:42  <Surya> Towards which amount?
2011-12-23T05:28:45  <janzert> probably take a stop at 750 first
2011-12-23T05:28:46  <Surya> 500?
2011-12-23T05:28:48  <Surya> ok
2011-12-23T05:28:58  <janzert> just to make sure everything is going ok
2011-12-23T05:29:19  <cseyu01> that guy's a pivot imo
2011-12-23T05:29:20  <janzert> so long as it all looks good there it'll then go to 500 fairly quickly after taht
2011-12-23T05:29:23  <Surya> yeah, there's not point to rush it. Since game rate is already quite good

2011-12-23T05:30:48  <Surya> Do you have a game number objective in mind? Or is it more about finding a converging rank pos per user?
2011-12-23T05:31:02  <janzert> for?
2011-12-23T05:31:09  <Surya> For the end of the challenge
2011-12-23T05:32:17  <janzert> My target has been 200 games for the top bots by the end while giving the rest as many games as possible, but I've never been sure we could make it
2011-12-23T05:32:27  <Surya> ok
2011-12-23T05:32:36  <Fluxid> do a cutoff of 250~~~~
2011-12-23T05:34:13  <janzert> there can be up to 430 players in game at any one point and there are frequently 500 paired at a given time
2011-12-23T05:34:28  <Surya> I'm 180, oscillating between 170 & 250 .. this cutoff is scary when it comes towards you :)

2011-12-23T05:35:06  <janzert> so going below 500 players would start cutting into the overall game rate and not give the remaining bots any more games anyway
2011-12-23T05:36:06  <cseyu01> so sick I'm 563 :(\
2011-12-23T05:36:08  <Surya> Hum, so the game rate will never be more than twice the current one. I see. The 200 games will be tough to reach, but if it's 180 I guess we could state it as "stabilized" :)
2011-12-23T05:36:43  <Surya> I think it will oscillate forever anyway
2011-12-23T05:37:13  <janzert> yeah, even though 200 has been my goal anything over 100 I'm happy with
2011-12-23T05:37:21  <Surya> I just hope I will have prefered maps & opponents at the end
2011-12-23T05:37:22  <janzert> which we definitely should make

2011-12-23T05:46:40  <proto_> multiplayer maps (>4) add a lot of randomness to the competition: take 8 similar bots in the same map, multiple times, and they'll be shuffling forever

2011-12-23T05:56:58  <Surya> Wouldn't be more fair to have an average skill over the last, let's say 50 games. Rather than stop at one point? (I know it's too late and people wouldn't like that, but it sounds more fair to me)
2011-12-23T05:57:11  <Surya> +it
2011-12-23T05:57:54  <Surya> since it's oscillating

2011-12-23T06:01:11  <Surya> Oh, I see. How precise is the sigma value? Is it supposed to go to 0 if we had 10000 games?

2011-12-23T06:04:01  <janzert> yeah, the precision stored is much greater of course. I'm not actually sure what sigma would be by the time you got to 10,000 games certainly it wouldn't be 0 and should never actually get to zero. The reality also is that this trueskill implementation at least may not converge because of precision issues.

2011-12-23T07:26:41  <Fluxid> :)
2011-12-23T07:28:12  <Fluxid> that would be interesting because you'd need to recreate map from information you get from "rays" and find all your bots on the map basing on it... but no idea what the winning condition would be and how to make it multiplayer ;P
2011-12-23T07:28:32  <Fluxid> maybe too hard
2011-12-23T07:31:05  <janzert> cutoff now going to 500
2011-12-23T07:31:17  <janzert> over the next 90 minutes
2011-12-23T07:31:34  <Fluxid> d('.'d)
2011-12-23T07:33:25  <Belerafon_L> maybe to play with ants again on next contest but every ant must have personal copy of control program, 20ms to turn and limited communication with other?
2011-12-23T07:34:45  <janzert> Belerafon_L: it's just not technically feasible to have a program running per ant, that was the original proposal for this contest
2011-12-23T07:35:18  <Fluxid> 200 processes per player, yay
2011-12-23T07:36:49  <teapot_moxian> an interesting question is: would the strategies be the same, if the current contest had not ants, but, say, tanks?

2011-12-23T07:39:57  <Belerafon_L> janzert: if you can solve problem with personal control of every agent, this will raise these games to a new level.
2011-12-23T07:40:54  <janzert> I'd say it'd be close to raising all of computing to a whole new level :P
2011-12-23T07:41:20  <cseyu01> surprised #1 has 3 timeouts
2011-12-23T07:41:28  <cseyu01> very east to prevent
2011-12-23T07:41:52  <cseyu01> 2 lines of code in every potentially long loop
2011-12-23T07:42:39  <cseyu01> my ants don't timeout, they take little naps until my population goes back down
2011-12-23T07:42:44  <janzert> cseyu01: a GC pause can still get you as can other things
2011-12-23T07:42:55  <cseyu01> ahh
2011-12-23T07:43:15  <cseyu01> I have perma timeout on tcpants
2011-12-23T07:43:23  <cseyu01> works fine locally
2011-12-23T07:43:28  <janzert> I'm actually rather of the opinion that a bot that never times out is probably too conservative, assuming the bot can always do useful things with more time
2011-12-23T07:43:38  <cseyu01> even adjusted turntime = 500
2011-12-23T07:43:50  <grc48> i think i'm the one with 25 timeouts :(
2011-12-23T07:44:18  <cseyu01> my new bot takes 350ms/turn every turn
2011-12-23T07:44:19  <Belerafon_L> janzert: no. For a play enough series computation of all agents but with limited communications between.
2011-12-23T07:44:32  <cseyu01> just analyses the map
2011-12-23T07:50:32  <Belerafon_L> If bot have a timeouts when two reasons: it have not timecheck with "return" on loops or... server have computation spikes from the other processes.

2011-12-23T08:20:19  <UncleVasya> yeah, interesing web-page.
2011-12-23T08:20:20  <g0llum> let me check..
2011-12-23T08:20:41  * UncleVasya is wondering how could he miss it
2011-12-23T08:21:51  <QGazQ> So anyone know what "crashed" means.  Coz I'm using java so its fairly unlikely the jvm crashed (though not impossible).  Does it just mean exited?  Still not sure why it would do it, but just curious
2011-12-23T08:21:54  <g0llum> more games, but lacking the current rank.

2011-12-23T08:23:38  <matthewd> QGazQ: Yeah, I think it comes down to "process went away when it wasn't supposed to"
2011-12-23T08:24:15  <matthewd> Unhandled exception maybe?
2011-12-23T08:24:19  <QGazQ> I wonder if it could be I hit memory limit or something
2011-12-23T08:24:34  <QGazQ> Yer I did think exception, but the same input doesn't cause it locally
2011-12-23T08:24:54  <matthewd> I was going to suggest that... but you'd have to be allocating crazy amounts to run out of memory
2011-12-23T08:26:06  <Belerafon_L> g0llum: current now updates very often, but the dinamics is more interesting. Please, apply patch :)

2011-12-23T08:34:02  <UncleVasya> balke_macho: one guy from administration said not earlier than after 3 month. But I think that not earlier than after 7-12 month
2011-12-23T08:34:03  <g0llum> ahh, just extend the url in a similar way,

2011-12-23T10:43:02  <Surya> g0llum. I actually tried to do what you did (using your code from the forum). I had never tried gae before, and got a problem with BeautifulSoup. Is there something in particular that you did with the yaml cfg?

2011-12-23T10:50:10  <flowenol> gotta fix my home network to make ap switching transparent
2011-12-23T10:51:41  <Surya> g0llum, thx, i will definitely use your code one day :)
2011-12-23T10:52:11  <QGazQ> I'd like to, but none of the stuff is really compatible with each other.  Another solution which seems more likely it to move to a house where 1 AP gets coverage all over! :)
2011-12-23T10:53:06  <g0llum> Surya, lol, it's one of those throwaway things, that you can't even read yourself the other day ;)
2011-12-23T10:53:53  <Surya> No, I mean not your exact code, but the gae / web parsing thing
2011-12-23T10:54:45  <Surya> I did the same with a php script one day, and yeah the code was really dirty aswell. I just wanted to retrieve all the nicknames of League of Legends' players.

2011-12-23T12:13:49  <QGazQ> Though up is relative, I'm not that much above the cut off, but looks like I should survive for the last round if it stays where it is
2011-12-23T12:14:12  <flowenol> right now i would even survive a 250 cutoff

2011-12-23T12:15:23  <flowenol> no
2011-12-23T12:15:44  <flowenol> afaik 500 is the last
2011-12-23T12:16:02  <flowenol> so no more changes
2011-12-23T12:16:21  <flowenol> unless janzert changes his mind
2011-12-23T12:16:52  <QGazQ> It should go up till all bots are playing on all servers at all times!
2011-12-23T12:17:25  <besh> what would that be ? 100 or 50 maybe
2011-12-23T12:18:08  <besh> it depnends on the map to . 10 player maps can take in more
2011-12-23T12:18:10  <Surya> He said going under 500 wouldn't make sense coz the pairing would have some issues or something.
2011-12-23T12:18:14  <QGazQ> Well assuming a server only does 1 game at a time, and some maps only have 2 slots, then 2
2011-12-23T12:18:33  <Surya> Anyway, good evening everyone, and good luck for those last hours:)

2011-12-23T12:19:48  <QGazQ> I suppose I should tidy the flat, got ppl coming around and it looks like a student flat atm, stuff everywhere (I'm 30)
2011-12-23T12:20:10  <flowenol> den do it
2011-12-23T12:20:32  <besh> I think giving lower bots a shot at the higher ranked bots may be a good idea.
2011-12-23T12:21:00  <besh> My bot is stuck at one rank for many games now and it doesn't seem to get games against higher ranked bots that much

2011-12-23T12:22:33  <QGazQ> I guess as sigma goes down the picker picks less spread out oponents?
2011-12-23T12:22:33  <besh> but maybe biased
2011-12-23T12:23:32  <besh> I think so.

2011-12-23T12:37:21  <McLeopold> the match maker doesn't care about the mu/sigma, it is picking opponents within a rank range

2011-12-23T12:39:40  <Scryer> Short form: xathis has been on top from 49 hrs out and on, GreenTea and teapotahedron have shared 2-3 from 24 hrs out, and the rest of the slots are mostly the same people shifting around gradually.
2011-12-23T12:39:58  <janzert> of course only the relative difference matters not absolute numbers
2011-12-23T12:40:36  <McLeopold> janzert: which translates to rank
2011-12-23T12:40:54  <pairofdice> :D
2011-12-23T12:41:03  <McLeopold> ie, pick the closest 10 bots, not pick bots with mu diff of something
2011-12-23T12:41:17  <McLeopold> We both know it's not really rank ;)
2011-12-23T12:41:17  <besh> i think for most bots now their ranks have stabilized. I can only expect changes in rank if my bot get games against higher ranked opponents. I used to beat some of them up there :)

2011-12-23T12:46:11  <besh> I think bots who got higher ranks early may have been better off, don't you think ?
2011-12-23T12:46:23  <pairofdice> Nawh, I was at #33
2011-12-23T12:46:30  <pairofdice> ;p

2011-12-23T13:32:13  <Scryer> besh - I see I wouldn't come in first in the Chess Programmer category either. :)
2011-12-23T13:32:34  <Garf> Scryer: what's your programs name?
2011-12-23T13:32:48  <Scryer> TECH - 1972 era.
2011-12-23T13:33:00  <Garf> holy sh

2011-12-23T13:33:30  <Scryer> He and I were competitors... he switched to my strategy. :)
2011-12-23T13:33:38  <Scryer> We were both at C-MU.
2011-12-23T13:33:38  <besh> Scryer: what is your chess program ?
2011-12-23T13:33:48  <Scryer> TECH - the Technology Chess Program.
2011-12-23T13:33:54  <Garf> Nr 19 and nr 101 are also chess programmers

2011-12-23T13:34:24  <Scryer> Yes, 1972... let's see if there's a link anywhere.
2011-12-23T13:34:30  <besh> 1972 , is that right ?

2011-12-23T15:12:21  <bqf> BenJackson: thanks! yeah, there were some interesting points raised. my initial approach would have been to use different bots for different "zones" (as in: let the best fighter do combat, the best explorer do exploring, etc), but even that would lead to trouble with regards to general tactics.

2011-12-23T15:42:38  <Murashka> Cowbandit possible because their goals do not match goals of advertisers

2011-12-23T15:58:01  <ChrisH_> Antimatroid: your bot is going to finish pretty high for a late first submission, nice job
2011-12-23T15:58:43  <Antimatroid> Cheers, next time hopefully I have more time to spend on my bot
2011-12-23T15:58:50  <BenJackson> it's hard to tell the game rate now because it seems like I'm always playing in a game
2011-12-23T15:59:18  <Antimatroid> Rune vision is up to 3rd, where did they come from.
2011-12-23T15:59:23  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: 40 players/min, 500 active players, so 12 minutes per game
2011-12-23T16:00:04  <ChrisH_> I had 4th earlier with Run in 5th, but I've slid back with a serios of maps my bot struggled with
2011-12-23T16:00:32  <ChrisH_> but it is so close in the 4 - 12 slots that I could finish anywhere in there just based on the last few games
2011-12-23T16:00:54  <ChrisH_> or I could slide down more if I get put on more unfavorable (to my bot) maps
2011-12-23T16:00:59  <BenJackson> yep
2011-12-23T16:01:12  <BenJackson> I was as low as 23
2011-12-23T16:01:13  <ChrisH_> so we should get about 25 more games each
2011-12-23T16:01:51  <BenJackson> the problem seems to be that if I lose a game vs a top player I lose more than I get back by beating several weaker players
2011-12-23T16:02:05  <BenJackson> so one final game where it throws me in with memetix and greentea could be worth 4 places
2011-12-23T16:02:29  <Antimatroid> Yeah, I suspect there's a few bots where the map type decides which is better
2011-12-23T16:02:48  <ChrisH_> i get knocked down a lot when I do poorly on the 8,9,or 10 player maps, and it takes a few wins to climb back
2011-12-23T16:03:00  <BenJackson> it's really frustrating how bad the map/setup is in the finals for actually differentiating close bots
2011-12-23T16:03:18  <ChrisH_> I also tend to lose the maps where it is a race to a choke point with access to food
2011-12-23T16:03:23  <BenJackson> there are tons of stalemates and ties that could have been broken if the maps were a bit smaller or had more food at the beginning or lasted more turns

2011-12-23T16:03:33  <Antimatroid> Yeah, I think in the future we should try to do fortnightly map generation or something
2011-12-23T16:03:49  <Antimatroid> Leading up to no surprises when we generate maps at the end
2011-12-23T16:04:06  <Scryer> I never got around to doing the stats on which maps had the best predictive value.
2011-12-23T16:04:10  <BenJackson> it's more than that, though
2011-12-23T16:04:21  <ChrisH_> ok, gotta go, might be back on just before the end, but if not, enjoy your holidays everyone, and I still plan to write more about my bot when I get time
2011-12-23T16:04:25  <BenJackson> now that all the top players are in at once at the top the games among the top 30 take longer than they did early in the contest
2011-12-23T16:04:32  <BenJackson> combat stalemates take forever
2011-12-23T16:04:43  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: merry christmas!

2011-12-23T16:12:15  <Murashka> why noo?
2011-12-23T16:13:26  <Antimatroid> I'm down to 27
2011-12-23T16:13:32  <Antimatroid> I now want top 25
2011-12-23T16:14:32  <Antimatroid> It can't keep losing aha surely
2011-12-23T16:14:49  <Frib> watch it drop to 35
2011-12-23T16:15:19  <Antimatroid> I'll be rally pissed off it it drops below that
2011-12-23T16:15:27  <Antimatroid> I finished 36 in ow
2011-12-23T16:15:38  <pairofdice> I've lost 80 ranks today
2011-12-23T16:15:57  <_flag> Well, back to 12th
2011-12-23T16:16:05  <pairofdice> Well, first I gained 80 ranks ;)
2011-12-23T16:16:19  <Frib> today I went from 390 to 340 to 410 to 350 now
2011-12-23T16:16:21  <Scryer> Yeah, I was hanging around 170 (down from 140 before the finals), and now up around 215. Ugh!
2011-12-23T16:20:05  <Murashka> it's mostly because of map rotation
2011-12-23T16:20:23  <Murashka> i think :)
2011-12-23T16:21:34  <Scryer> Changing my strategy depending on map type didn't get even close to the top of my to-do list.
2011-12-23T16:22:20  <pairofdice> Maybe in the next challenge I get some of my todo-list actually implemented
2011-12-23T16:24:00  <Scryer> Now that I know about the contest maybe I can get started early enough next time.
2011-12-23T16:24:18  <Frib> my to-do list is to focus less on tweaking insignificant stuff and focus more on adding new features and having a proper testing setup
2011-12-23T16:25:07  <Antimatroid> The more people who stick around to help make the next contest, the zoo er it will be ready btw
2011-12-23T16:25:09  <bretep> Sometimes something that seems insignificant can have quite some effect.
2011-12-23T16:25:54  <Scryer> Frib - Agreed. Instead of figuring out whether 15% or 20% is a better number of ants to stick around within defense distance, maybe actually get combat resolution right. :)
2011-12-23T16:25:56  <Frib> yes but spending night after night changing a few constants just to see what changes, and then later on add something else making it obsolete is a bit silly :D
2011-12-23T16:26:03  <Frib> exactly Scryer
2011-12-23T16:27:39  <bretep> Ah, right. That sounds familiair :p

2011-12-23T16:32:32  <stocha> I fail to see how xathis should win over greentee
2011-12-23T16:32:34  <McLeopold> anyone know haskell well?
2011-12-23T16:33:27  <GreenTea> hm 2nd timeout..
2011-12-23T16:33:37  <stocha> McLeopold: i don't know it. But i wonder what you need to know :)
2011-12-23T16:33:49  <stocha> GreenTea: ah, your bot have time out ?
2011-12-23T16:33:49  <Antimatroid> Stochastic xathis has a good bot
2011-12-23T16:33:54  <stocha> how will the final run exactly ?
2011-12-23T16:34:02  <Antimatroid> It is running
2011-12-23T16:34:06  <GreenTea> stocha. last game, yes
2011-12-23T16:34:12  <McLeopold> I'm looking for a critic http://pastebin.com/fjJmbqJG
2011-12-23T16:34:21  <stocha> Antimatroid: i don't say xathis is bad. I just say that i fail to see how greentea is not better
2011-12-23T16:34:26  <GreenTea> but 2 timeouts on 141 games. not so bad
2011-12-23T16:34:33  <Frib> I kow a little
2011-12-23T16:34:51  <stocha> GreenTea: it can make a difference though. i guess.

2011-12-23T16:35:06  <Scryer> GreenTea - I noticed you had a turn 0 crash earlier also.

2011-12-23T16:35:53  <McLeopold> my question would be, can the code be faster?
2011-12-23T16:36:01  <stocha> McLeopold: are you trying to build a haskell bot ?
2011-12-23T16:36:03  <Scryer> GreenTea http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=331374
2011-12-23T16:36:08  <McLeopold> no, a haskell map generator
2011-12-23T16:36:44  <stocha> Scryer: how do one know it's greentea that timed out ?
2011-12-23T16:36:47  <Scryer> GreenTea - it was fresh in my mind, since I just posted about it in the forum a few minutes ago. :)
2011-12-23T16:37:00  <Frib> from looking at your haskell code, you know more about it than me :D
2011-12-23T16:37:12  <Scryer> stocha He's listed as the loser.
2011-12-23T16:37:14  <stocha> GreenTea: so it was more that 2 timeout then ?
2011-12-23T16:37:36  <stocha> Scryer: ah. It used to have some message during the first days of the beta
2011-12-23T16:37:36  <Scryer> But it's listed as a crash rather than a timeout, which could be different.
2011-12-23T16:37:51  <GreenTea> stocha. yes this was crash 9
2011-12-23T16:37:52  <GreenTea> (
2011-12-23T16:38:07  <McLeopold> I'm wondering if there is a faster way than mapping the show function over lists
2011-12-23T16:38:08  <stocha> GreenTea: where do you see it is a crash ?
2011-12-23T16:38:26  <GreenTea> stosha. in game visualizer
2011-12-23T16:38:31  <stocha> GreenTea: the weaknesses of xathis are quite obvious, yours are not :)
2011-12-23T16:38:51  <McLeopold> GreenTea: no stderr output either
2011-12-23T16:39:23  <stocha> Although of course i can't judge combat efficiency, only strategy
2011-12-23T16:39:24  <GreenTea> McLeopold, like java not starting. or something..
2011-12-23T16:39:34  <stocha> because combat rule is quite messy indeed
2011-12-23T16:39:58  <GreenTea> stocha, my big weankness is combat of big count of ants
2011-12-23T16:40:02  <bluegaspode> can someone give me some hints with TrueSkill? I just played against a better ranked player (and lost). But still lost mu. I thought that when I lose against a better player this is to be expected and shouldn't affect mu?
2011-12-23T16:40:09  <stocha> GreenTea: there are lots of java bots. It's wierd that only yours is affected
2011-12-23T16:40:30  <pairofdice> You lose less mu against a better player
2011-12-23T16:40:38  <McLeopold> bluegaspode: how much mu?
2011-12-23T16:40:39  <stocha> GreenTea: can you show me an example ?
2011-12-23T16:41:08  <GreenTea> sthocha. i tested againts Memetix in local machine

2011-12-23T16:41:45  <BenJackson> only the amount changes
2011-12-23T16:41:49  <stocha> GreenTea: is it a combat algorithm weakness ?
2011-12-23T16:41:57  <BenJackson> if you win to #5000 player your mu will barely go up and sigma barely go down
2011-12-23T16:42:03  <GreenTea> my luck is that on outher types of maps i completely destroy him)
2011-12-23T16:42:07  <bluegaspode> sigmas didn't change anymore
2011-12-23T16:42:21  <bluegaspode> ok - his sigma +0.01
2011-12-23T16:42:21  <stocha> GreenTea: bad exploration ?
2011-12-23T16:42:23  <GreenTea> stocha. yes
2011-12-23T16:42:39  <McLeopold> bluegaspode: that's not too much.  based on the mu/sigma of each player, it is trying to get the distributions separated in the best way possible, ie, to get the likelyhood of superiority to be about 80% for the winner
2011-12-23T16:42:39  <BenJackson> GreenTea: I am also good on some map setups and not others, but I never bothered to work out how common the good/bad ones were
2011-12-23T16:42:46  <stocha> GreenTea: why ?
2011-12-23T16:42:53  <GreenTea> stocha. no no. battle algorihm my bot often fall back to quickly
2011-12-23T16:43:03  <McLeopold> so, that could be shrink sigmas or adjust mu's or both
2011-12-23T16:43:04  <stocha> GreenTea: ah to shy then
2011-12-23T16:43:11  <stocha> GreenTea: why ?
2011-12-23T16:43:29  <stocha> GreenTea: isn't it obvious that you need to be quite agressive ?
2011-12-23T16:43:40  <McLeopold> bluegaspode: if it previously thought you only had a 30% chance of winning, you will still go down some until it thinks you have a 20% chance
2011-12-23T16:43:51  <stocha> unless maybe when the frontier is very close to the nest

2011-12-23T16:44:33  <bluegaspode> hhmm. I tried to calculated our ranges before the fight (mu +- 3* sigma) and my min was below his min and my max was below his max.
2011-12-23T16:44:44  <GreenTea> sthocha. and Memetix use this. go like a tank. no step back
2011-12-23T16:44:51  <stocha> GreenTea: most good bot seems quite conservative. So you need to assume they will be conservative.
2011-12-23T16:44:54  <Scryer> stocha - Based on his rank, I'm guessing he got the balance pretty close to right. :)
2011-12-23T16:45:12  <bluegaspode> So I thought it was to be expected that I lost, but seems I haven't been to far away from him then, so that I still had a chance of winning :)
2011-12-23T16:45:24  <stocha> Scryer: i didn't test much, so i can only try to guess based on a few seen games
2011-12-23T16:45:30  <McLeopold> bluegaspode: take the before mu and sigma for each bot and run them through the trueskill calc on microsofts site, and see what the match quality is
2011-12-23T16:45:46  <pairofdice> It's always funny on KGS when DDKs criticise the games of high dans
2011-12-23T16:45:46  <bluegaspode> do you have a link?
2011-12-23T16:45:52  <stocha> Scryer: but i prefer to observe the bot beahvior than assume that a good rank means a good behavior :p
2011-12-23T16:45:55  <McLeopold> if the match quality isn't 0%, then there will probably be an update either way
2011-12-23T16:46:25  <McLeopold> http://atom.research.microsoft.com/trueskill/rankcalculator.aspx
2011-12-23T16:46:29  <GreenTea> why players played same amount of games have different sigma?
2011-12-23T16:46:39  <stocha> pairofdice: i play on kgs too. The thing is, you don't know that i'm a 15k for sure :)
2011-12-23T16:46:46  <Scryer> pairofdice - I was playing a 4 dan player (real board) once, and he suggested "You should move faster. You'll be making the wrong move anyway."
2011-12-23T16:47:15  <pairofdice> stocha, I don't, but GreenTea is #2
2011-12-23T16:47:17  <stocha> Lot's of go players around there i see :p
2011-12-23T16:47:22  <McLeopold> GreenTea: it depends on who they played and if it was an upset or not
2011-12-23T16:47:38  <McLeopold> upsets cause larger sigma drops
2011-12-23T16:47:41  <pairofdice> I'm only about 2k on KGS
2011-12-23T16:47:54  <stocha> pairofdice: do you think it means he has good strategic balance ?
2011-12-23T16:48:04  <McLeopold> also, when you are looking at multiplayer games, if the rainbow of colors is out of order, there was an upset
2011-12-23T16:48:23  <pairofdice> I'm sure there's somewhere he can improve but the balance is pretty good
2011-12-23T16:48:25  <McLeopold> whoever is red is supposed to beat whoever is orange and so on
2011-12-23T16:48:32  <stocha> pairofdice: don't you wonder how far from optimal they may be ? (even there are a lot of parameters, the game being multiplayer on unknown maps)
2011-12-23T16:48:39  <pairofdice> I do
2011-12-23T16:48:53  <stocha> pairofdice: don't you spot some ways to make them stronger ?
2011-12-23T16:48:54  <pairofdice> On several occasions before finals
2011-12-23T16:49:30  <pairofdice> But my bot is 400 :)
2011-12-23T16:49:34  <stocha> pairofdice: the way xathis put fooders and never move them is quite far from optimal. Although it simplify things
2011-12-23T16:49:44  <pairofdice> Yeah, I agree
2011-12-23T16:50:14  <stocha> pairofdice: so there is an obvious improvement there. Although it might not be a huge difference in the current setting
2011-12-23T16:50:49  <stocha> pairofdice: The thing is, it's easier to see how bot should do things, than to implement / debug them. And then you have to prioritize of course
2011-12-23T16:50:51  <pairofdice> Of course I try to spot the deficiencies in other bots so I could beat theam
2011-12-23T16:51:05  <stocha> pairofdice: maybe what will be obivious to us i costly and innefficient
2011-12-23T16:51:13  <bluegaspode> McLeopold: ok match quality is shown as 94.9% - and this calc changes values as well (even more drastically than in this particular game)
2011-12-23T16:51:35  <pairofdice> But when I try to make them work myself ....
2011-12-23T16:51:49  <bluegaspode> guess my education in stochastics is not good enough to understand the magic :)
2011-12-23T16:52:10  <stocha> pairofdice: the beta was running for sure at least from August. And i don't thing the combat rule changed from that point.
2011-12-23T16:52:22  <McLeopold> bluegaspode: those calcs should match almost exactly if you half the numbers
2011-12-23T16:52:47  <McLeopold> stocha: actually, it did
2011-12-23T16:52:56  <stocha> pairofdice: some people had a lot of time to build up / debug their bug, and gather their ideas. And then some might be very skilled at making those live and efficient.
2011-12-23T16:53:11  <stocha> McLeopold: when did it changed ?
2011-12-23T16:53:32  <McLeopold> uhh, now I can't remember
2011-12-23T16:53:44  <stocha> McLeopold: i don't remember precisely, but it was quite fast. I don't think anyone had combat code prior to the change ...
2011-12-23T16:54:16  <stocha> McLeopold: then sir_macelon and flag_capper appeared with combat code. Which was compatible with current contest.
2011-12-23T16:54:19  <McLeopold> we went from distributing 1 point of attack across nearby enemies to the focus method
2011-12-23T16:54:43  <stocha> McLeopold: i think it was before the end of august.
2011-12-23T16:55:02  <McLeopold> yeah, I dissapeared for 2 months in there somewhere
2011-12-23T16:55:24  *** Migi32 <Migi32!~migi@dD57678E5.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-23T16:55:39  <bluegaspode> McLeopold: no they don't - enemies sigma went up 0.01 in this game, microsofts calc reduces enemies sigma
2011-12-23T16:55:47  <stocha> I dispise the combat rule. I still fail to see how "ant die on same square" will make the contest lest interesting, mathematically speaking.
2011-12-23T16:56:16  <stocha> McLeopold: it clearly pushed me away from the contest. I didn't want to mess with such an arbitrary rule :p
2011-12-23T16:56:28  <stocha> that could change any day beside.
2011-12-23T16:56:35  <bluegaspode> McLeopold: the game showed: enemy: 77.89 (+ 0.12), 1.31 (+0.01)  me: 77.12 (-0.13) 1.37 (+0.00)
2011-12-23T16:57:07  * avdg wonders if Migi32 would stay on 32
2011-12-23T16:57:13  <flowenol> btw my sigma got static
2011-12-23T16:57:13  <McLeopold> stocha: the main reason was to make it harder to pass by ant defensive lines
2011-12-23T16:57:13  <pairofdice> Oh btw, happy Festivus.
2011-12-23T16:57:15  <bluegaspode> McLeopold: so I entered red: 77.77 1.30  blue 77.25  1.37  into that calculator
2011-12-23T16:57:26  <stocha> Although when i see all the excitation in the final stage, i kind of regret a bit.
2011-12-23T16:57:33  <Migi32> avdg: that would be kind of awesome :D
2011-12-23T16:57:40  <McLeopold> bluegaspode: the ms calc uses different values for initial mu, sigma and beta

2011-12-23T16:58:31  <stocha> McLeopold: it does make people be quite conservative with their ants. But i'm not sure they wouldn't be also with ant die on same square. Frontier would have been harder to guard though.
2011-12-23T16:59:02  <McLeopold> you would have needed more ants, and that just slows down the game

2011-12-23T16:59:46  <bluegaspode> McLeopold: draw probability can be changed in the calc, still different results (rising vs. falling sigma). Anyway: I realize it's too mach stochastics involved for my little brain, thanks for you help
2011-12-23T16:59:51  <stocha> McLeopold: the current combat rule is very computing hungry, and hard to optimize.
2011-12-23T17:00:02  <McLeopold> :)
2011-12-23T17:00:56  <Scryer> FWIW, the current "won at turn 1" number is 28 out of the last 1000 games, or 3%, so 5% draw rate doesn't seem outrageous.
2011-12-23T17:01:13  <BenJackson> hard to move much

2011-12-23T18:06:47  <Fluxid> amstan: personal adventures. just had to do projects that doesn't fit in django at all
2011-12-23T18:06:55  <Extrarius> and it's bsd license, which gives it a boost in my eyes
2011-12-23T18:07:09  <amstan> Fluxid: do you think it would fit with our project?

2011-12-23T18:07:56  <amstan> Fluxid: would you be against using it though?
2011-12-23T18:08:00  <Migi32> are you going to recode the whole site?
2011-12-23T18:08:04  <amstan> Fluxid: maybe you have better suggestions

2011-12-23T18:08:32  <Migi32> amstan: why? Is there a problem with the current code?
2011-12-23T18:08:43  <amstan> Migi32: yes...
2011-12-23T18:08:58  <Fluxid> no, when saying it's an abomination i was mostly joking :) but i were you i'd check if queries you use now in current site translate to django orm nicely
2011-12-23T18:09:16  <Fluxid> if i were*
2011-12-23T18:10:54  <amstan> Migi32: there's this one long rant by mcleopold somewhere
2011-12-23T18:11:51  <Migi32> amstan: ah, cool, cause I was glancing over the code on github and it doesn't look nearly as bad as some other projects I've had to work with
2011-12-23T18:12:15  <Migi32> so I'll read the mcleopold rant :)
2011-12-23T18:12:36  <amstan> Migi32: he deleted it in the latest fiasco with the rankings not getting updated it seems: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/74096b246b14496ccc482a299e4cfeba799fb1d0/website/api_get_task.php#L29
2011-12-23T18:14:12  <Migi32> amstan: ah yes, the problem is PHP in general. I fully agree :D
2011-12-23T18:14:40  <amstan> nothing majorly wrong with what we have so far(except it's kinda home grown and inextensible)
2011-12-23T18:16:40  <GreenTea> 0.25 points to xathis
2011-12-23T18:16:42  <Fluxid> uh, then mcleopold might rant about django orm not supporting *insert random relative db term here* ;) but then again, something could change to better! (i still love sqlalchemy)
2011-12-23T18:17:31  <amstan> Migi32: we had to do stuff like this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/a9caaf7aa65dfd21753693e4fb350b65f263e318
2011-12-23T18:17:51  <amstan> Fluxid: i'm sure you can extend the django orm
2011-12-23T18:18:49  <Migi32> oh GreenTea you're not really going to snipe the #1 spot are you? :D

2011-12-23T18:19:59  <amstan> Migi32: his bot does do lose against xathis, but that's not the only thing that matters
2011-12-23T18:20:13  <amstan> it also matters how well you own the other bots too

2011-12-23T18:43:23  <xathis> Redgis: not yet but i will in a few hours
2011-12-23T18:43:31  <Zannick> i see it is getting interesting
2011-12-23T18:43:36  <Redgis> ahe great, I was hopping for this

2011-12-23T18:44:15  <Antimatroid> Getting is a bit of an understatement ;)
2011-12-23T18:44:17  <Redgis> I wonder what are the concept he used yes

2011-12-23T18:44:28  <GreenTea> heh http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=344790&user=398
2011-12-23T18:44:30  <Redgis> cause he's quite above every ohter bot
2011-12-23T18:44:31  <newbie|2> @rankings
2011-12-23T18:44:39  <artart78> Redgis: he's the 2nd one now
2011-12-23T18:44:44  <contestbot> newbie|2: Top 10 players: GreenTea(90.3), xathis(89.7), runevision(87.3), protocolocon(86.9), lazarant(86.9), teapotahedron(86.8), Memetix(86.3), pguillory(85.5), FlagCapper(85.5), fourmidable(85.4)

2011-12-23T18:50:15  <Antimatroid> He blitzes past him
2011-12-23T18:50:18  <onion42> some last minute drama
2011-12-23T18:50:30  <Antimatroid> ChrisH my bot is failing me miserably
2011-12-23T18:50:32  <Murashka> can if maps give it to him

2011-12-23T18:51:26  <ChrisH_> Antimatroid: still a few games left to pass him again.
2011-12-23T18:51:46  <dr0b3rts> So, will 2 hours be enough to safely declare "rank stabilized!" for the top spot?
2011-12-23T18:51:48  <ChrisH_> I hope I get some good maps to get me back into top 10.
2011-12-23T18:51:50  <Antimatroid> Or drop even lower :p

2011-12-23T18:52:18  <Antimatroid> The contest has to end some time
2011-12-23T18:52:23  <Antimatroid> It isn't going to be extended
2011-12-23T18:52:26  <ChrisH_> roflmao: not so fast
2011-12-23T18:52:40  <ChrisH_> roflmao: seen the rankings lately
2011-12-23T18:52:59  <Antimatroid> I think we're mostly understanding of that
2011-12-23T18:53:02  <dr0b3rts> How low does the pairing cutoff go?
2011-12-23T18:53:11  <Redgis> do you have any idea when will be the next challenge ?
2011-12-23T18:53:11  <Antimatroid> 500
2011-12-23T18:53:12  <roflmao> oh wait duh
2011-12-23T18:53:15  <roflmao> it's still running xD
2011-12-23T18:53:17  <ChrisH_> protocoloco has made a late surge as well
2011-12-23T18:53:21  <Extrarius> I think just to make it interesting, all the sigmas should be set to 10 for the last few minutes =-P
2011-12-23T18:53:35  <Redgis> it seems last year there was "fall 2010" and "winter 2010"
2011-12-23T18:53:58  <Redgis> was no spring, nor summer was it ?
2011-12-23T18:54:00  <Antimatroid> Yeah ants took longer to get ready than we were hoping
2011-12-23T18:54:42  <Redgis> oh i see, preparation time
2011-12-23T18:55:55  <Antimatroid> ChrisH wow yeah he's third now
2011-12-23T18:56:14  <Extrarius> for the next contest, how about a turn-based strategy game where the attributes of the units available are randomly created each game (with all sides having the same options)
2011-12-23T18:56:49  <Antimatroid> Too complicated to watch
2011-12-23T18:57:05  <Redgis> (are there already some plans for the next challenge ?)
2011-12-23T18:57:20  <Redgis> (-some +any)
2011-12-23T18:57:22  <Migi32> Redgis: yes, there are some on the forums
2011-12-23T18:57:24  <Antimatroid> Not many I don't think
2011-12-23T18:57:38  <pairofdice> Migi32: plans or suggestions?
2011-12-23T18:57:40  <Antimatroid> We'll start making them in the next few weeks
2011-12-23T18:57:48  <Migi32> oh plans, no not that I know of
2011-12-23T18:57:56  <Migi32> only suggestions so far I think
2011-12-23T18:58:02  <Antimatroid> I imagine anyway

2011-12-23T19:08:03  <GreenTea> i have 6 games in last hour
2011-12-23T19:08:16  <GreenTea> so, ~ 12 more games
2011-12-23T19:08:19  <GreenTea> will see..

2011-12-23T19:11:55  <BenJackson> oh the algorithm is catching them up?
2011-12-23T19:11:58  <BenJackson> that's kind of a bug
2011-12-23T19:12:03  <BenJackson> should note that for next time
2011-12-23T19:12:18  <janzert> it's because the least played player is always chosen as a seed

2011-12-23T19:14:31  <ChrisH_> woot, I just got a win over xathis, protocolocon and pguillory to move back into 10th
2011-12-23T19:16:15  <Antimatroid> Poor flag
2011-12-23T19:16:19  <Antimatroid> Out of the 10
2011-12-23T19:16:29  <Speedy_Consoles> yeah, one of your ants luckily got to the food paradise :D
2011-12-23T19:16:36  <ChrisH_> yep
2011-12-23T19:16:49  <ChrisH_> especially lucky because I usually lose those maps
2011-12-23T19:17:11  <Antimatroid> This was a bad time for this game ate mix up
2011-12-23T19:17:17  <Antimatroid> Rate*
2011-12-23T19:17:40  <janzert> ?
2011-12-23T19:17:43  <Antimatroid> I've had hardly any games recently
2011-12-23T19:17:47  <janzert> it's pretty much a continual thing
2011-12-23T19:17:48  <ChrisH_> now I am hoping for one or maybe two more good wins to take over the lead for the US.
2011-12-23T19:18:10  <Antimatroid> Janzert: but isn't it catching that bot up at the bottom?
2011-12-23T19:18:30  <janzert> not solely
2011-12-23T19:18:31  <amstan> contestbot: seen j3camero
2011-12-23T19:18:31  <contestbot> amstan: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 22 hours, 16 minutes, and 7 seconds ago: <j3camero> Some of the game ideas on the forums are awesome.
2011-12-23T19:18:41  <pairofdice> There's also 100 other bots playing at the same time
2011-12-23T19:19:09  <ChrisH_> Antimatroid: there are 40+ servers running, that's a lot of games going on at once, I doubt that bot is in all of them
2011-12-23T19:19:14  <bretep> Rating difference between 500 and 501 isn't big. 500th losing a match might do that trick again :x
2011-12-23T19:19:32  <Antimatroid> Maybe I just got too many games ahead
2011-12-23T19:19:43  <bretep> Stivo is 500th now :v
2011-12-23T19:19:48  <bretep> With 99 games
2011-12-23T19:20:18  <Antimatroid> Can a bot play on more than one server simultaneously?
2011-12-23T19:20:31  <amstan> Antimatroid: i think so
2011-12-23T19:20:36  <Antimatroid> Ie. Would it be using up more than one server catching up?
2011-12-23T19:20:50  <janzert> all bots in the top 500 are now caught up to at least 157 games at the moment
2011-12-23T19:20:57  <Antimatroid> Cool

2011-12-23T19:24:27  <ChrisH_> playing in another game, could be good, could be bad.  ;)
2011-12-23T19:24:44  <Antimatroid> Amstan that's why the end time is pre determined and common knowledge, so there can be no bias over the current rankings when ending it
2011-12-23T19:25:18  <amstan> Antimatroid: that's assuming that nobody acuses of of rigging because the game that's in progress in the last second
2011-12-23T19:25:29  <ChrisH_> and good thing there is a big counter at the top of the web pages so no one is confused about time zones or anything
2011-12-23T19:25:31  <janzert> given that it's this close I'm even debating about leaving the channel and not looking at rankings when there are about 5 minutes to go
2011-12-23T19:25:39  <Antimatroid> Sure, you'll always have them
2011-12-23T19:25:48  <Antimatroid> But this minimizes any legitimate grievance
2011-12-23T19:25:55  <Zannick> it would help to have the manager automatically stop handing out games
2011-12-23T19:26:12  <amstan> yeah.. is it possible to script it to stop the games at exactly 9pm
2011-12-23T19:26:14  <amstan> without user input?
2011-12-23T19:26:18  <ChrisH_> it was bad, lost to xathis :(
2011-12-23T19:26:24  <janzert> it's not set up for that no :(
2011-12-23T19:26:33  <janzert> and I'd rather not add it this late
2011-12-23T19:26:35  <Zannick> yeah, something to do for next time
2011-12-23T19:26:40  <Zannick> don't add it now :<

2011-12-23T19:27:08  <janzert> some extra, won't really know till the end of the month
2011-12-23T19:27:16  <amstan> ok
2011-12-23T19:27:18  <Antimatroid> I think that'd be a bad idea
2011-12-23T19:27:21  <janzert> but I wasn't able to spend as much on finals as I hoped :/
2011-12-23T19:28:13  <bretep> How much of the servers are from totaalnet?
2011-12-23T19:28:32  <janzert> yeah, an extension of time now I would be agreeing with the critics that it is a manipulation of the rankings
2011-12-23T19:28:34  <Speedy_Consoles> ChrisH_: you just brought xathis a little more to the top :D
2011-12-23T19:28:36  <janzert> bretep: 12

2011-12-23T19:28:52  <contestbot> amstan: Top 10 players: GreenTea(90.0), xathis(89.5), protocolocon(87.3), runevision(87.1), lazarant(87.0), teapotahedron(86.7), Memetix(86.2), pguillory(85.7), ChrisH(85.4), FlagCapper(85.4)
2011-12-23T19:28:55  <flowenol> janzert extension? hell no
2011-12-23T19:28:56  <QGazQ> Give be root PW and I'll do it, I'm drunk so even if I wanted to infulence my bot I'm probably past the balmer value and likely to make it worse ;P
2011-12-23T19:29:05  <ChrisH_> Speedy_Consoles: I beat him in the previous game though, so I'm not helping that much.  ;)
2011-12-23T19:29:15  <QGazQ> how about a crontab which just kill -9's all python processes?
2011-12-23T19:29:38  <amstan> QGazQ: that's on 40 different hosts
2011-12-23T19:29:50  <amstan> QGazQ: good luck syncronizing them
2011-12-23T19:29:51  <janzert> it'll only take me about 15 seconds at the most, don't worry
2011-12-23T19:30:00  <BenJackson> I think I've figured out why the rankings are so poor, though
2011-12-23T19:30:07  <ChrisH_> Wouldn't it be easier to stop the matchmaking engine first, then kill the workers
2011-12-23T19:30:11  <BenJackson> the matchmaker tries to make games where people have better and worse opponents
2011-12-23T19:30:17  <flowenol> janzert tons of connections prepare them all and execute by hand?
2011-12-23T19:30:17  <QGazQ> ntpd + cron, but yer was kidding
2011-12-23T19:30:27  <BenJackson> but the duration of the games, size of the maps and food levels is causing a lot of unecessary stalemates
2011-12-23T19:30:35  <BenJackson> so games where you finish in th emiddle are unnecessarily indecisive
2011-12-23T19:30:47  <janzert> flowenol: no, I just terminate them through the control panel of ec2 and totaalnet
2011-12-23T19:31:02  <QGazQ> As far as I see it this is for fun, your guys are doing as best you can, so whatever the number I got it good
2011-12-23T19:31:04  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: Also, games where one bot dominates and there is a big tie for last don't help sort things out either
2011-12-23T19:31:10  <QGazQ> *is
2011-12-23T19:31:26  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: although in many of those I looked at the rankings were quite clear to a human
2011-12-23T19:31:28  <Antimatroid> Also games don't fully stabilize
2011-12-23T19:31:37  <BenJackson> eg players held out for very distinct lengths of time
2011-12-23T19:31:45  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yes, but the way the game is scored that is lost
2011-12-23T19:31:50  <BenJackson> yep
2011-12-23T19:32:03  <ChrisH_> I mentioned that here weeks before finals.
2011-12-23T19:32:13  <ChrisH_> but I don't have a better solution.
2011-12-23T19:32:20  <BenJackson> I just didn't see quite as many stalemates before the finals
2011-12-23T19:32:34  <amstan> janzert: totaalnet cp?
2011-12-23T19:32:34  <ChrisH_> there are a couple of maps that seem more stalemate prone
2011-12-23T19:32:36  <BenJackson> some of them would be solved at 1250 or 1500 turns
2011-12-23T19:32:37  <janzert> if we had scored it to include that there is a worry that everyone would have become to defensive
2011-12-23T19:32:45  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: one reason not to use all NEW maps in the finals...
2011-12-23T19:33:09  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I also think it would be mitigated a lot by simply having more food
2011-12-23T19:33:10  <ChrisH_> but I also think that the quality of the combat logic is a lot more equal in a larger number of top bots now than before
2011-12-23T19:33:18  <Zannick> i thought we had some sort of stalemate detection for map rejection
2011-12-23T19:33:25  <BenJackson> the game is an initial push followed by a slow dominance due to territory
2011-12-23T19:33:32  <BenJackson> on low food rate maps the territory dominance just takes too long
2011-12-23T19:33:35  <Zannick> maybe that was planet wars
2011-12-23T19:33:46  <flowenol> janzert ahh
2011-12-23T19:33:47  <BenJackson> it's possible that even low food games should have ramped up to some higher minimum after 500 turns
2011-12-23T19:33:57  <Zannick> or not during the finals
2011-12-23T19:34:13  <flowenol> I just found an ant walking in my monitor (a live one) that must mean something
2011-12-23T19:34:19  <QGazQ> lol
2011-12-23T19:34:26  <BenJackson> I have a mouse in my attic
2011-12-23T19:34:29  <QGazQ> bug in the monitor is good luck

2011-12-23T19:34:46  <pairofdice> Atleast then it's not in the source
2011-12-23T19:34:50  <Antimatroid> That might make a good forum thread, what could have been done better and how?

2011-12-23T19:37:27  <GreenTea> BenJackson, i can't get bot input on this map. so
2011-12-23T19:37:29  <ikaros> just came home from a party and then this
2011-12-23T19:37:30  <ikaros> hehe
2011-12-23T19:38:04  <GreenTea> BenJackson looks like some bug, ,maby java not started, i dont know
2011-12-23T19:38:26  <Migi32> GreenTea: how much time does your bot take on an average turn?
2011-12-23T19:39:01  <BenJackson> GreenTea: you could probably construct it by hand.  Looks like it started with food next to one of the ants?
2011-12-23T19:39:02  <Migi32> totally unrelated to the timeout, I know, but I'm just interested :)
2011-12-23T19:39:09  <bretep> It seems to have crashed on turn one, so the only input would be the map stats
2011-12-23T19:39:16  <bretep> turn zero*

2011-12-23T19:45:12  <Cowbandit> is it just me or do a lot of the new maps have the ant hills within point blank range of each other?
2011-12-23T19:45:13  <ChrisH_> no, the problem is that it doesn't see any food

2011-12-23T19:45:48  <ChrisH_> and it is stuck against the wall so it keeps reexploring seen territory because it is stuck in a local minimum
2011-12-23T19:45:50  <Antimatroid> Explore
2011-12-23T19:46:21  <Antimatroid> Ant should have owned that
2011-12-23T19:46:50  <ChrisH_> Antimatroid: i think it would have worked if it hadn't been stuck against the wall, but that's not a situation i saw much in testing, rarely is an ant out there with no food and none of my ants coming up behind it
2011-12-23T19:46:58  <Antimatroid> Man my bot hates me
2011-12-23T19:47:35  <ChrisH_> then it got locked in 1v1 combat with another ant and in that case it won't explore anymore
2011-12-23T19:47:45  <ChrisH_> just a weird situation
2011-12-23T19:47:49  <BenJackson> I do have a food bonus in combat
2011-12-23T19:47:57  <BenJackson> to try to get 1v1 ants to edge toward food

2011-12-23T19:48:09  <Antimatroid> I do too but I don't think I sampled the moves well format
2011-12-23T19:48:22  <Antimatroid> Similarly I screwed up sampling moves with hills nearby
2011-12-23T19:48:26  <ChrisH_> yes, food, but I don't care about exploring. Many games in the finals I've thought I should have added that.
2011-12-23T19:48:58  <Antimatroid> Exploring will get you the food when ants start close
2011-12-23T19:49:10  <Antimatroid> Ie. Maps like that
2011-12-23T19:49:20  <Antimatroid> Although similarly without the one choke point
2011-12-23T19:49:32  <BenJackson> I like exploring but since I added code to definitively engage ants there are cases where I should have ignored enemies early and explored
2011-12-23T19:50:17  <ChrisH_> Antimatroid: normally my ants do explore, but that opening situation was a hole in the logic that I never saw until now.

2011-12-23T19:51:55  <janzert> oh, I know how to stop everything best. At the deadline I'll just stop the pairing script, since the php no longer creates matchups once the queue empties out everything will just stop
2011-12-23T19:52:10  <ChrisH_> janzert: I thought I suggested that above.
2011-12-23T19:52:12  <Antimatroid> Janzert that sounds best
2011-12-23T19:52:26  <ChrisH_> janzert: glad you thought of it.  ;)
2011-12-23T19:52:30  <BenJackson> so we'll still play ~100 more games after the cutoff?
2011-12-23T19:52:38  <amstan> janzert: but then 9pm is not when everything stops
2011-12-23T19:52:44  <Antimatroid> ChrisH he'll still have to stop that script manually
2011-12-23T19:52:45  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: surely you're familiar with that technique
2011-12-23T19:52:55  <BenJackson> suggest something to someone, wait for them to turn around and suggest it back, congratulate them on a fine idea
2011-12-23T19:52:56  <amstan> that's a little sketchy, people will expect to see the results at 9
2011-12-23T19:53:08  <amstan> janzert: how about at 8:50 you do that?
2011-12-23T19:53:09  <janzert> amstan: it won't exactly no, but it should be only 10-15 minutes later.
2011-12-23T19:53:27  <janzert> it took me over an hour to get the results out after planetwars deadline
2011-12-23T19:53:29  <BenJackson> how about next time I flip over to 15th
2011-12-23T19:53:31  <Antimatroid> I keep doing that to mcstar
2011-12-23T19:53:35  <Antimatroid> But months later
2011-12-23T19:53:43  <ChrisH_> Should you also stop accepting game results from the workers into the DB at 9pm?
2011-12-23T19:53:52  <analyst74> ScsiOverdrive, still an hour left, could run 10+ games
2011-12-23T19:54:08  <janzert> ChrisH_: there's not a good way to do that
2011-12-23T19:54:13  <amstan> janzert: i think it'll be smoother if we just kill the workers directly
2011-12-23T19:54:21  <bretep> A few Xathis greentea games needed
2011-12-23T19:54:25  <Antimatroid> Thered be no need to stop the other script then
2011-12-23T19:54:35  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: Ever seen this one:  http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ConeOfAnswers
2011-12-23T19:54:43  <Antimatroid> Bretep we can't adjust how things run now
2011-12-23T19:54:55  <janzert> hmm, I rather like that there is no way for anyone to know the results when we stop it if we stop the it but killing the pairing script

2011-12-23T19:56:14  <amstan> janzert: oh!
2011-12-23T19:56:17  <amstan> janzert: change the worker key
2011-12-23T19:56:17  <Antimatroid> Or even better print it on the homepage
2011-12-23T19:56:31  <janzert> amstan: that' s no better than just killing the workers
2011-12-23T19:56:44  <janzert> we could still know what the result is at the moment we do it
2011-12-23T19:56:45  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: the other thing I've noticed is that sometimes I'm sent to help someone.  so I grill them about what's going on.  in the process I find they know both the problem AND the solution, they just didn't see it
2011-12-23T19:56:57  <amstan> janzert: oh.. i see, that's your goal then
2011-12-23T19:57:01  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yep
2011-12-23T19:57:02  <GreenTea> has +2 games comparet to xathis

2011-12-23T19:57:56  <BenJackson> er .01 and .03
2011-12-23T19:58:05  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: but then there are many times where they are just clueless.  Too many of those encounters and you start looking for a better place to work, that was the situation where I was working when the story I linked occurred.
2011-12-23T19:58:18  <amstan> janzert: yeah, but something like the worker_key can be scripted with an at job
2011-12-23T19:58:38  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: my favorite intervention was when a VP put me on a problem (which I later found out had been going on for a full quarter and had cost some revenue)
2011-12-23T19:58:52  <BenJackson> ultimately I think my purpose was to shame the guy who was responsible for it into actually working on it

2011-12-23T19:59:26  <amstan> ChrisH_: why?
2011-12-23T19:59:29  <BenJackson> he had to show me how to use the special debug hardware and I gathered some info to show what the problem was and then he worked around it in software
2011-12-23T19:59:33  <FranPeruzzi> crap, c2 link. There goes my evening.
2011-12-23T19:59:42  <BenJackson> and I didn't think it was a big deal until the solution of the problem was announced at the next company meeting
2011-12-23T19:59:42  <pairofdice> Because he's #8
2011-12-23T19:59:45  <ChrisH_> I'm #1 in my country and language and I don't think I'll go up more than #8
2011-12-23T20:00:09  <ChrisH_> although memtix is catchable i suppose
2011-12-23T20:00:29  <Antimatroid> ChrisH I had all my little things checked off before, now I've lost like half of them
2011-12-23T20:00:29  <BenJackson> well this game is taking a long time

2011-12-23T20:05:15  <Antimatroid> I think green tea and xathis should most importantly know what will happen

2011-12-23T20:14:03  <contestbot> sashaSochka: Top 10 players: xathis(90.3), GreenTea(90.0), protocolocon(87.6), runevision(86.9), lazarant(86.8), teapotahedron(86.7), ChrisH(85.6), fourmidable(85.5), pguillory(85.5), Memetix(85.4)
2011-12-23T20:14:12  <bhasker> rebelxt!
2011-12-23T20:14:16  <bhasker> how is your bot doing!
2011-12-23T20:14:26  <janzert> 1v1 is a different set emphasis of skills
2011-12-23T20:14:39  <bhasker> but if they tie on the regular format
2011-12-23T20:14:43  <bhasker> why not make them go head on
2011-12-23T20:14:44  <onion42> Memetix might drop out of top10 :(
2011-12-23T20:14:47  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: but then Murashka won one, so I'm at 15th again with them on either side... but opposite sides
2011-12-23T20:14:51  <ChrisH_> yes, especially when it comes to trading ants 1 for 1 in combat not costing as much
2011-12-23T20:14:52  <FranPeruzzi> If skill is same, sigma breaks tie?
2011-12-23T20:14:53  <bhasker> not bad rebel 95!
2011-12-23T20:14:59  <BenJackson> these finals are not really settling :)
2011-12-23T20:14:59  <rebelxt> it's messing around at #95 ;-) was hoping you would do this years contest. last year was so much fun
2011-12-23T20:15:06  <bhasker> i did do
2011-12-23T20:15:10  <bhasker> but just didn't have enough time
2011-12-23T20:15:17  <bhasker> so i am languishing at 945
2011-12-23T20:15:28  <bhasker> and my latest version which could have bumped that up
2011-12-23T20:15:29  <bhasker> a lot
2011-12-23T20:15:33  <bhasker> never compiled on the server
2011-12-23T20:15:38  <rebelxt> bhasker: i had a little one too, so little time to work on this contest :(
2011-12-23T20:15:39  <BenJackson> bhasker: 945 is pretty much final for you, right?
2011-12-23T20:15:40  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I don't think it is a stable system in the localized standings.
2011-12-23T20:15:40  <bhasker> and i dind't have time to fix it before deadline
2011-12-23T20:15:43  <onion42> #419 is where the cool kids are at
2011-12-23T20:15:46  <bhasker> yes
2011-12-23T20:15:48  <BenJackson> I assume top 500 bots are not getting ejected clear to 945 at this point
2011-12-23T20:16:01  <bhasker> i doubt it would have gone higher anyway
2011-12-23T20:16:06  <bhasker> it has been at the same skill range
2011-12-23T20:16:07  <bhasker> for last 2 days

2011-12-23T20:16:18  <bhasker> my main problem was timeouts
2011-12-23T20:16:20  <BenJackson> onion42: nigerian scams?
2011-12-23T20:16:26  <bhasker> so many games my bot just times out due to stupid minmax for battle
2011-12-23T20:16:34  <bhasker> maybe i should have just implemented memetix's battle
2011-12-23T20:16:39  <bhasker> or a1k0ns
2011-12-23T20:16:45  <ChrisH_> well, i just narrowed the game between me and teapot, but it's probably too big to close before the end, just hoping to hold onto 7th.
2011-12-23T20:16:47  <bhasker> and focussed on strategy
2011-12-23T20:16:54  <onion42> mine does minimax, but its too conservative and gets into silly deadlocks
2011-12-23T20:17:00  <rebelxt> yeah timeouts were a problem for me too
2011-12-23T20:17:08  <onion42> i don't timeout though :)
2011-12-23T20:17:36  <Antimatroid> Bhasker I just got phd funding so hopefully I might have a bit more time too
2011-12-23T20:17:37  <bhasker> like this http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=334683&user=13197
2011-12-23T20:17:45  <BenJackson> I might not get seeded again
2011-12-23T20:17:47  <bhasker> nice grats antimatroid!
2011-12-23T20:17:48  <BenJackson> which might work out well for me
2011-12-23T20:17:48  <rebelxt> bhasker: you have to do next year's contest!
2011-12-23T20:17:56  <bhasker> i will hopefully :)
2011-12-23T20:18:00  <bhasker> this year there were too many things
2011-12-23T20:18:01  <Antimatroid> Cheers
2011-12-23T20:18:05  <bhasker> i had a decent bot till they changed the rules
2011-12-23T20:18:11  <bhasker> with all the hill stuff
2011-12-23T20:18:25  <Antimatroid> Hill stuff made the game though
2011-12-23T20:18:29  <ChrisH_> Antimatroid: congrats on the funding.
2011-12-23T20:18:38  <bhasker> then i was too busy between a new job and baby to spend enough time
2011-12-23T20:18:39  <Antimatroid> I'm glad we went back to them
2011-12-23T20:18:47  <Speedy_Consoles> there is more luck in the game since that hill stuff imo
2011-12-23T20:18:50  <sashaSochka> 0.12 difference

2011-12-23T20:19:16  <bhasker> only thing i would have liked is for hill to have a visibility of its own
2011-12-23T20:19:17  <Speedy_Consoles> you can be the one with most ants at the end of the game but still lose it
2011-12-23T20:19:19  <bhasker> at all times
2011-12-23T20:19:19  <bhasker> :)

2011-12-23T20:19:33  <Antimatroid> I can only say cheers so many times people :p
2011-12-23T20:19:33  <bhasker> yea sad:-\
2011-12-23T20:19:39  <Speedy_Consoles> you can do that with guards

2011-12-23T20:20:55  <BenJackson> ow
2011-12-23T20:21:01  <janzert> well, they will both have rank 1 don't know what the display order would be though
2011-12-23T20:21:13  <janzert> ties do show a tied rank

2011-12-23T20:23:04  <bhasker> which my newer version was better at too

2011-12-23T20:23:31  <Antimatroid> I had nothing to fall back on
2011-12-23T20:23:41  <bhasker> i was using a custom hash for hash_map

2011-12-23T20:27:01  <bhasker> with some pascal thrown in
2011-12-23T20:27:18  <Speedy_Consoles> i have no pathfinding at all :D

2011-12-23T20:28:05  <ChrisH_> java is not even close to interpreted IMO
2011-12-23T20:28:09  <QGazQ> Its first compiled to byte code, then on the fly compiled to native IIRC
2011-12-23T20:28:12  <bhasker> java is a compiled language
2011-12-23T20:28:30  <bhasker> all java code is byte compiled to jvm then jit optimized to native
2011-12-23T20:28:42  <bhasker> not really interpreted at that point
2011-12-23T20:28:43  <Antimatroid> I love the quote that goes something like if java had true garbage collection it would kill most programs upon execution

2011-12-23T20:28:55  <ChrisH_> it is compiled to byte code and then JIT compiled at run time.  it runs pretty fast and this contest plays well to a JIT compiler as well I think
2011-12-23T20:29:11  <bhasker> anyway the bots get a 500 ms startup or 5 second startup
2011-12-23T20:29:15  <bhasker> which is more than enough to jit compile
2011-12-23T20:29:17  <onion42> not quite as fast as C though :P
2011-12-23T20:29:26  <BenJackson> not like the ICFP where they always try to slant things in a very functional way and often invoke the program once per turn with input
2011-12-23T20:29:26  <ChrisH_> 3000ms before turn one
2011-12-23T20:29:34  <Antimatroid> I use like a second of my startup time on large maps

2011-12-23T20:30:32  <ChrisH_> onion42: perhaps not as fast as hand optimized C, but I bet the java JIT compiler can do better inlining and so forth in many cases
2011-12-23T20:30:48  <Murashka> 30 min to finish
2011-12-23T20:30:51  <bhasker> frankly i think the speed difference at these levels is immaterial
2011-12-23T20:30:53  <Speedy_Consoles> i calculate some attack areas at startup
2011-12-23T20:31:02  <Speedy_Consoles> and the view of an ant
2011-12-23T20:31:02  <rebelxt> interesting, 1st place is still up in the air considering 0.12 diff
2011-12-23T20:31:04  <bhasker> it will be more your algorithms and data structure choices that matter
2011-12-23T20:31:11  <bhasker> the run time of java vs c/c++ will not matter much

2011-12-23T20:34:31  <bhasker> hmm and its still slower?
2011-12-23T20:34:34  <QGazQ> So I should set a mirc event to run @timeleft and @rankings every min? :)
2011-12-23T20:34:39  <Antimatroid> vector<uint8_t>
2011-12-23T20:34:51  <QGazQ> I could just watch the web page, but you know
2011-12-23T20:35:01  <bhasker> but i think it uses 1 byte per 8 bools?
2011-12-23T20:35:02  <Cowbandit> lol that too
2011-12-23T20:35:02  <Fluxid> maybe contestbot can be programmed in such way, dunno
2011-12-23T20:35:05  <onion42> i was using 2d vectors, was causing some slowdown when i was adding stuff in sub-optimally
2011-12-23T20:35:06  <ChrisH_> Cowbandit: greentea could take the lead again in 3 or 4 games if they go well and xathis has a loss or two
2011-12-23T20:35:17  <Cowbandit> ah i see

2011-12-23T20:41:45  <BenJackson> doh, played a bad game near the end]
2011-12-23T20:42:16  <bhasker> interesting xathis you used minmax
2011-12-23T20:42:21  <ScsiOverdrive> Did any of the top bots use diffusion? or was it BFS all the way?
2011-12-23T20:42:33  <bhasker> and i have a similar approach of creating ministates for combat
2011-12-23T20:42:44  <bhasker> except one bug i never got around to fixing was not making moves that cause ants to wrap around

2011-12-23T20:43:04  <bhasker> since my ministate was a replica of the main state it had support for ants wrapping around which caused errors
2011-12-23T20:43:07  <bhasker> in evaluation
2011-12-23T20:43:23  <bhasker> since an ant at the edge would show up in attack radius
2011-12-23T20:43:30  <amstan> i really hope protocolocon doesn't move though

2011-12-23T21:07:51  <bhasker> a1k0n miss top 10 by 1 !

2011-12-23T21:08:19  <FranPeruzzi> Should it say 'playing in a game right now'? It didn't say that at cutoff.
2011-12-23T21:08:23  <tomb__> Congrats everyone. These last few hours have been crazy
2011-12-23T21:08:25  <BenJackson> woah I just went down a place :(
