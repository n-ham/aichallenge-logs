2011-03-08T00:02:12  <antimatroid> i can also put in the view radius and have it enforce no one can see anyone else at the start

2011-03-08T00:02:55  <McLeopold> sigh: you really don't need to worry about battle resolution or scoring to do the spawning

2011-03-08T00:03:20  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if i'm strong enough to pick it up?

2011-03-08T00:03:59  <sigh> McLeopold: ok, I will have a look at implementing those
2011-03-08T00:04:04  <lavalamp> I didn't realize I did a merge there. Silly github.
2011-03-08T00:04:33  <antimatroid> there are issues with symmetric food spawning that i will outline

2011-03-08T00:13:53  <antimatroid> cristicise my symmetric spawning method and discuss what i asked you to
2011-03-08T00:14:47  <amstan> McLeopold: what's the status of the new schema branch?
2011-03-08T00:15:40  <McLeopold> sucks
2011-03-08T00:15:49  <antimatroid> :p
2011-03-08T00:15:56  <sigh> the only viable fair one I can see there is sections
2011-03-08T00:16:03  <antimatroid> oh, i thought you were talking about my food spawning method for a second :P
2011-03-08T00:16:09  <sigh> as it can deal with conflicts
2011-03-08T00:16:13  <amstan> McLeopold: well.. good thing it's a branch then, right?
2011-03-08T00:16:23  <antimatroid> sigh: what about placing food in squares at an equal distance to players there?
2011-03-08T00:16:27  <antimatroid> it would get very messy
2011-03-08T00:16:49  <sigh> what if the square is occupied?
2011-03-08T00:16:59  <antimatroid> with my method?
2011-03-08T00:17:04  <McLeopold> remember, no bias toward or away from players
2011-03-08T00:17:28  <antimatroid> i am very unsure about what to do there, hence my line saying discuss :P
2011-03-08T00:18:44  <sigh> I don't think you can resolve in a completely fair way
2011-03-08T00:18:52  <sigh> conflicts that is
2011-03-08T00:18:54  <McLeopold> amstan: I remember you saying something about mysql data types at some point.  Do you have any concerns?
2011-03-08T00:19:16  <amstan> McLeopold: nope, i was just babling about int(11), wondering why it's 11, but if it's the default it's fine
2011-03-08T00:19:24  <McLeopold> sigh: for a single turn, maybe not, but hopefully over time we can make it fair
2011-03-08T00:19:43  <McLeopold> amstan: 11 is for if zeropadding is turned on for display
2011-03-08T00:20:01  <McLeopold> an int with any number is still 32 bit
2011-03-08T00:20:25  <amstan> McLeopold: ok, cool
2011-03-08T00:20:27  <antimatroid> how much does food spawning add to making the game play interesting?
2011-03-08T00:20:47  <McLeopold> it will probably be the #1 gripe
2011-03-08T00:20:48  <amstan> antimatroid: if there's no food, the ants starve, then there's no ants, then there's no game
2011-03-08T00:20:54  <McLeopold> and that
2011-03-08T00:21:10  <amstan> you don't want starving ants crawling around the contest server
2011-03-08T00:21:25  <antimatroid> amstan: there would be food placed at the start
2011-03-08T00:21:34  <antimatroid> quite a bit more to let the armies increase in size
2011-03-08T00:21:35  <McLeopold> they're like the tumbler beasts
2011-03-08T00:22:11  <sigh> McLeopold: INT(11) is default in MySQL when you create an INT without qualification
2011-03-08T00:22:11  <amstan> McLeopold: or like the minecraft creepers?
2011-03-08T00:22:20  <amstan> McLeopold: ^ that
2011-03-08T00:23:58  <amstan> antimatroid: is your c++ bot done?

2011-03-08T00:24:23  <amstan> antimatroid: can you make sure it is?
2011-03-08T00:24:40  <amstan> antimatroid: i want to update the issue
2011-03-08T00:24:54  <antimatroid> i will get onto that now

2011-03-08T00:33:37  <amstan> antimatroid: don't we have that?
2011-03-08T00:34:38  <antimatroid> yes, i just read it
2011-03-08T00:34:44  <antimatroid> that was my +1 for the existence of it
2011-03-08T00:35:00  <amstan> antimatroid: yeah.. when tron started, i was unaware of some thing
2011-03-08T00:35:06  <amstan> i was just admining the forums at the time
2011-03-08T00:35:19  <amstan> and it was agreed that i shouldn't compete for that one
2011-03-08T00:35:40  <amstan> so i thought it would be a good idea to have a page to describe when exactly you can't compete anymore
2011-03-08T00:37:13  <antimatroid> are old contest admins allowed to compete?
2011-03-08T00:37:41  <antimatroid> currently they all still have access i believe, but assuming that was cut
2011-03-08T00:37:50  <amstan> antimatroid: maybe
2011-03-08T00:38:01  <amstan> antimatroid: idk.. it doesn't really specify i guess
2011-03-08T00:38:31  <antimatroid> i personally don't see why not
2011-03-08T00:38:59  <amstan> well.. scenario: we decide to use the same codebase from last contest, something like ... zeta with next zeta
2011-03-08T00:39:21  <antimatroid> zeta is meant to run over all future contests yeah?
2011-03-08T00:39:26  <antimatroid> unless it's every rewritten
2011-03-08T00:39:31  <amstan> and we demote and admin to a contestant, he might have some backdoors to regain access
2011-03-08T00:39:31  <antimatroid> ever*
2011-03-08T00:39:46  <amstan> antimatroid: well.. ideally yeah
2011-03-08T00:39:53  <antimatroid> yeah i guess
2011-03-08T00:40:04  <antimatroid> looks like no janzert competition, or you
2011-03-08T00:40:22  <antimatroid> i demand you write a bot for tcp! :P
2011-03-08T00:40:25  <amstan> i think the main issue with the current codebase is documentation, we need more of it in order to have it easily adapted to another contest
2011-03-08T00:40:53  <amstan> antimatroid: well.. idk if it's applicable to janzert and the current codebase, we're pretty much moving to new servers, the codebase has been looked over
2011-03-08T00:41:33  <antimatroid> i doubt janzert would have the time to spend much time on it anyway
2011-03-08T00:41:47  <amstan> but as jeff told me when i wanted to compeete, even if the organizers trust the person that wants to compeete, it has to look good from the outside
2011-03-08T00:42:08  <antimatroid> yeah, i know that issue, that's the only reason i'll accept the backdoor argument
2011-03-08T00:42:14  <janzert> since the code is open source now I don't think it would be much of a problem to demote admins anymore
2011-03-08T00:42:29  <amstan> we can't have the following headline show somewhere: "Previous admin wins the Google AI Challenge, insider knowlege?"
2011-03-08T00:42:30  <janzert> not that I'm planning on wanting to do that
2011-03-08T00:43:07  <antimatroid> you know you would possibly get the same headline with a contributer winning?

2011-03-08T00:43:45  <antimatroid> i think arguments work pretty much the same in both instances :P
2011-03-08T00:43:47  <amstan> antimatroid: the servers themselves are not open source
2011-03-08T00:43:58  <antimatroid> how much of it?
2011-03-08T00:43:59  <amstan> the code is, and was since may
2011-03-08T00:44:22  <amstan> antimatroid: by not open source i mean.. their configuration is not publicly accessible
2011-03-08T00:44:29  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-03-08T00:44:43  <amstan> so not everyone knows if there's a cron job somewhere ready to execute
2011-03-08T00:45:57  <amstan> we should probably wake up jeff from hibernation

2011-03-08T05:02:41  <sigh> make what shorter?
2011-03-08T05:03:23  <sigh> and if naming a variable "map" doesn't break the style guide, then the style guide needs to be re-written :P
2011-03-08T05:07:18  <antimatroid> ha i considered that, but what else to call it?  :P

2011-03-08T05:17:39  <antimatroid> for testing asymmetric maps i think
2011-03-08T05:17:43  <antimatroid> i was told to make it, so i did :P
2011-03-08T05:18:01  <antimatroid> it was fun to write the access count code anyway
2011-03-08T05:18:23  <antimatroid> that same painting algorithm is going to be used over and over again by everyone
2011-03-08T05:19:06  <sigh> I think the painting algorithm is not the best way to do it
2011-03-08T05:19:22  <sigh> maybe
2011-03-08T05:19:29  <antimatroid> shoot..
2011-03-08T05:19:47  <sigh> why not just compute the distance from each point to the players directly?
2011-03-08T05:19:58  <antimatroid> because water might block the path?
2011-03-08T05:20:07  <sigh> ah, I see
2011-03-08T05:20:07  <antimatroid> and you might have more than one starting ant per player etc.
2011-03-08T05:20:19  <sigh> yeah... fair enough... I was being silly
2011-03-08T05:20:23  <antimatroid> :p
2011-03-08T05:20:30  <antimatroid> i'm a big fan of that painting algorithm
2011-03-08T05:20:41  <sigh> :)
2011-03-08T05:20:57  <sigh> if everyone is going to use it, it might be worth cleaning it up a bit
2011-03-08T05:21:13  <antimatroid> i'm going to put how to calculate visibility in the tutorial
2011-03-08T05:21:14  <sigh> or moving into some utils module
2011-03-08T05:21:15  <antimatroid> which uses that
2011-03-08T05:21:33  <antimatroid> or people seemed keen to even include that in the starter packages
2011-03-08T05:21:48  <antimatroid> i think it'd be cooler if people had to write their own copy
2011-03-08T05:22:11  <antimatroid> with a walk through tutorial of it
2011-03-08T05:22:12  <sigh> hehe :)
2011-03-08T05:25:19  <antimatroid> sigh: i actually tried using euclidean distance with painting and that breaks even if there is no water
2011-03-08T05:25:35  <sigh> breaks?
2011-03-08T05:25:36  <antimatroid> consider this situation
2011-03-08T05:25:37  <antimatroid> ..a
2011-03-08T05:25:37  <antimatroid> .b.
2011-03-08T05:25:51  <antimatroid> they are both the same walk distance from top left, but euclidean distance is different
2011-03-08T05:26:03  <antimatroid> well, they aren't with edges wrapped, but you know what i mean yeah?
2011-03-08T05:26:25  <antimatroid> you would have to use manhatten, but then it'd break as soon as you addded in water again
2011-03-08T05:26:36  <sigh> oh, of course euclidean distance doesn't work if the geometry is not euclidean
2011-03-08T05:26:56  <antimatroid> yep, i got so far as implementing everything and was like why is this all wrong?
2011-03-08T05:27:05  <sigh> :P
2011-03-08T05:27:09  <antimatroid> and then i realised how wrong i was :P
2011-03-08T05:27:15  <sigh> :)
2011-03-08T05:27:39  <sigh> do you know much about this food spawn code?
2011-03-08T05:27:48  <antimatroid> have you looked at that wiki page?
2011-03-08T05:27:51  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-08T05:27:58  <antimatroid> do you understand my symmetric method?
2011-03-08T05:28:49  <sigh> i understand each part, but I haven't thought about what the result is like
2011-03-08T05:28:52  <antimatroid> i would do something like that with asymmetric, but generate sets of "first reachable squares" by each player from starting positions, and spawn a food square in each of those sets each n turns or something
2011-03-08T05:29:57  <antimatroid> i'm trying to work out how to make antisymmetric maps, just for fun, but i need to work out how to define a relation between locations that would allow it
2011-03-08T05:30:21  <antimatroid> it's going to be a stretch, but novelty maps are fun
2011-03-08T05:31:22  <antimatroid> oh i can think of a relation
2011-03-08T05:31:37  <antimatroid> i just need to rotate the indexes rather than transpose them
2011-03-08T05:31:50  <antimatroid> i think, that might not quote work
2011-03-08T05:32:18  <sigh> ok, what's the easiest way to run the engine?
2011-03-08T05:32:27  <antimatroid> i haven't run it yet :P
2011-03-08T05:39:00  <antimatroid> sigh: i also need someone to write a makefile for me at some point (for the cpp starter bot) who knows how and how to make sure it works (preferably that can set the DEBUG constant in bug.h) if you would be willing to be my savour there? :P
2011-03-08T05:40:08  <sigh> Makefiles are a mystery to me most of the time, but I can take a shot
2011-03-08T05:42:29  <antimatroid> cheers :)
2011-03-08T05:42:35  <antimatroid> don't bother if it's too annoying
2011-03-08T05:50:47  <antimatroid> i don't think maps should be given any priority based on their perceived fairness if we do go for asymmetric maps
2011-03-08T05:51:01  <antimatroid> only that we have a system for throwing out maps if enough games have been played and they're deemed unfair
2011-03-08T05:57:15  *** mega1 <mega1!~user@catv4E5C915D.pool.t-online.hu> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-08T05:59:49  <aerique> for the game parameters on turn 0: are all of them always passed or are there defaults?
2011-03-08T06:00:25  <antimatroid> aerique: they are all always passed atm, but you should be able to support skipping unknown parameters
2011-03-08T06:00:37  <sigh> antimatroid: is there a consistent terminology for what the (row,col) tuple is called?
2011-03-08T06:00:39  <antimatroid> it's been done like that so if something needs to be added, hopefully it can be done without breaking all old bots
2011-03-08T06:00:48  <antimatroid> sigh: for what?
2011-03-08T06:00:53  <aerique> antimatroid: thanks
2011-03-08T06:00:57  <sigh> for a coordinate on the map
2011-03-08T06:01:01  <antimatroid> in my bot?
2011-03-08T06:01:15  <antimatroid> i haven't looked at the engine code at all if you're referring to that
2011-03-08T06:01:15  <sigh> in the code in the repo
2011-03-08T06:01:18  <sigh> oh, ok
2011-03-08T06:01:21  <antimatroid> sorry :P
2011-03-08T06:08:39  <antimatroid> it's going to be much easier to make the game trees in this show obvious cool behaviour
2011-03-08T06:09:21  <antimatroid> and one really does want to partition "fighting" ants and do a vector of game trees each turn
2011-03-08T06:13:25  <sigh> is there any significance to the characters "?" and "!" in a map?
2011-03-08T06:13:40  <antimatroid> ? is unknown
2011-03-08T06:13:44  <antimatroid> would ! be dead?
2011-03-08T06:13:45  <antimatroid> i dunno
2011-03-08T06:40:13  <sigh> ok, so I've got an implementation of do_food_sections
2011-03-08T06:40:36  <sigh> I copied your access_map algorithm, antimatroid, but made it less messy :P
2011-03-08T06:53:22  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-08T06:53:28  <antimatroid> it is rather messy
2011-03-08T06:53:45  <antimatroid> did you do that sort line? or was that not needed?
2011-03-08T06:54:06  <Frontier> about those starter bots... should they avoid collisions or not?
2011-03-08T06:54:17  <antimatroid> Frontier: i'm unsure, mine isn't at present
2011-03-08T06:54:37  <Frontier> i know. and i was wondering why it is so blazing fast
2011-03-08T06:55:02  <antimatroid> it would still be about as fast if i did :P

2011-03-08T07:20:19  <antimatroid> oh god, why does python require self to be written everywhere in classes?
2011-03-08T07:20:29  <antimatroid> it's redundent :\
2011-03-08T07:21:45  <sigh> it's just being explicit
2011-03-08T07:22:42  <sigh> uh oh... I think McLeopold's being inconsistent in his (row, col), (col, row) usage
2011-03-08T07:23:53  <jbroman> antimatroid: Since Python doesn't have variable declarations per se, there needs to be some way of distinguishing between local and instance variables. And they chose to use "self." for that purpose.
2011-03-08T07:25:15  <sigh> techincally you can call it whatever you want is "self" annoys you, but please don't check that in :P
2011-03-08T07:32:06  <sigh> antimatroid: here's what I did for access_map... the output is a bit different to what you had though: https://github.com/sigh/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py#L441

2011-03-08T19:39:44  <Zannick> hm
2011-03-08T19:39:50  * Zannick aptitude search malbolge
2011-03-08T19:43:19  <McLeopold> Zannick: it's not really as entertaining as lolcode
2011-03-08T19:43:22  <Zannick> malbolge is interpreted, and aptitude has an interpreter for it
2011-03-08T19:43:43  <Zannick> i say we let any poor soul who wants to use it use it :)
2011-03-08T19:43:51  <Zannick> McLeopold: i find it hilarious
2011-03-08T19:44:00  <McLeopold> Okay, write the starter bot...
2011-03-08T19:44:22  <Zannick> since when do we need a starter bot for every language :P
2011-03-08T19:44:23  <jmcarthur> i wonder if malbolge makes a reasonable compiler target :P
2011-03-08T19:44:49  <janzert> let's try not to do too many joke languages
2011-03-08T19:44:51  <jmcarthur> i've never even attempted malbolge before
2011-03-08T19:44:52  <Zannick> jmcarthur: only if you use a turing-complete malbolge extension
2011-03-08T19:45:11  <janzert> remember the workers do have to install each one
2011-03-08T19:45:17  <jmcarthur> Zannick: who says anything about a turing complete language? :P
2011-03-08T19:45:56  <Zannick> jmcarthur: well, compilation from what? malbolge as originally designed has a memory limit
2011-03-08T19:46:00  <jmcarthur> okay but really... is malbolge not turing complete or something
2011-03-08T19:46:01  <jmcarthur> ?
2011-03-08T19:46:17  <jmcarthur> oh, from some generic embedded dsl or something
2011-03-08T19:46:21  <Zannick> yes, as originally designed
2011-03-08T19:49:55  <jmcarthur> okay yeah, this would be a pretty painful target language

2011-03-08T20:16:56  <sigh> McLeopold: did you have a look at my code, was it what you wanted?
2011-03-08T20:22:59  <McLeopold> yes, it is
2011-03-08T20:23:07  <McLeopold> I'm fixing the col/row stuff now
2011-03-08T20:23:22  <Frontier> McLeopold: Where was your new replay spec again? I'd like to implement it
2011-03-08T20:23:28  <sigh> cool
2011-03-08T20:23:47  <McLeopold> Frontier: in a comment on the issue
2011-03-08T20:24:02  <Frontier> ah ok
2011-03-08T20:25:27  <McLeopold> sigh: Can I nitpick your code?
2011-03-08T20:25:36  <sigh> change whatever you want
2011-03-08T20:25:59  <McLeopold> so about naming variables, you have one named 'coord'
2011-03-08T20:26:22  <McLeopold> to me, that seems more like a type than a description of what the variable contains
2011-03-08T20:26:34  <McLeopold> so I changed it to 'loc' for location
2011-03-08T20:26:57  <McLeopold> you also had a dr, dc, which I changed to d_row, d_col
2011-03-08T20:27:24  <McLeopold> So, that is some serious bike shedding, but if we both work on the engine, it would be nice to be consistent with each other.

2011-03-08T20:27:59  <sigh> no worries, choosing variable names was a bit difficult since I didn't know what conventions you already had, and I haven't been that involved in the dev

2011-03-08T20:28:22  <sigh> I figured i'd just pick something, and it would be easy to change :)
2011-03-08T20:28:29  <McLeopold> I know, I'm hoping you will be willing to do bug fixes with the engine later on.
2011-03-08T20:28:42  <sigh> yeah, shouldn't be a problem
2011-03-08T20:29:02  <McLeopold> also, I can't stand python document strings, but I think I need to get over that
2011-03-08T20:29:07  <sigh> haha
2011-03-08T20:29:24  <McLeopold> I probably need to comment more anyway
2011-03-08T20:29:40  <Frontier> McLeopold: I don't need the fifth parameter to food. I have to set the player anyway when the food is converted and before that point it has no special meaning.
2011-03-08T20:29:53  <McLeopold> okay
2011-03-08T20:29:56  <sigh> yeah, I didn't like them much either at first, but it makes using some python tools easier
2011-03-08T20:30:02  <Frontier> Hey I even documented my JavaScript with JSDoc :D
2011-03-08T20:30:04  <McLeopold> Can you put my comment in the wiki with the changes?
2011-03-08T20:30:21  <Frontier> I'll do that
2011-03-08T20:30:42  <McLeopold> In general, I'm against writing code in specific ways just to make documentation easier to generate.
2011-03-08T20:30:54  <McLeopold> Python strings are about the nicest way to do it.
2011-03-08T20:31:11  <McLeopold> I just like my code to be compact so I don't have to scroll much. :P
2011-03-08T20:31:31  <sigh> *shrug* I'm just following the normal standards :)
2011-03-08T20:31:45  <sigh> yeah, I like my code compact too
2011-03-08T20:31:57  <McLeopold> sigh: sooo, if you bored, I need to implement the new replay format Frontier is going to implement.
2011-03-08T20:32:17  <McLeopold> You would need more knowledge of the engine to do it.
2011-03-08T20:32:32  <sigh> probably yeah
2011-03-08T20:32:36  <McLeopold> so, wait for my col/row fix tonight
2011-03-08T20:32:46  <McLeopold> I can't get to it for a couple days still, so no rush.

2011-03-08T22:29:07  <Frontier> *sigh* I thought about the player scores in the replay format. And I think...
2011-03-08T22:30:35  <Frontier> WOW i crashed the git hub ^^
2011-03-08T22:30:49  <amstan> Frontier: dude..
2011-03-08T22:30:53  <amstan> Frontier: now what..
2011-03-08T22:32:32  <Frontier> sigh: Well I imagine at the end of the replay files there is a line like 's <turn 1 start score> <turn 2 score> ... <end of last player turn score>'
2011-03-08T22:33:08  <sigh> Frontier: are you talking to me?
2011-03-08T22:33:21  <Frontier> What do they mean by "Github is going out of service, all your data will be lost." ?
2011-03-08T22:34:12  <Frontier> sigh: Yes, I heard that McLeopold asked you to work on the output of the engine
2011-03-08T22:34:41  <amstan> meh.. i'm not concerned, everyone working on the project has a copy of the project
2011-03-08T22:35:09  <Frontier> Beware the angry rainbow unicorn: http://github.com/
2011-03-08T22:35:30  <sigh> oh ok... umm... let me know when you've sorted the specs out?
2011-03-08T22:35:36  <Frontier> wait... is that the fluffy rainbow unicorn someone was talking about?
2011-03-08T22:35:43  <amstan> Frontier: looks like it
2011-03-08T22:36:31  <sigh> Frontier: bear in mind I don't really know that much about the game yet
2011-03-08T22:37:09  <Frontier> uhm.. how much do you know? I don't know much either, but I only have to visualize the outcome ^^
2011-03-08T22:37:44  <sigh> I know how the food spawning works! McLeopold made me write it... that's about it
2011-03-08T22:38:56  <Frontier> I could imagine that you will have some trouble with the new idea that the output is no longer based on 'what happens in turn x on square y', but on individual food/ant items that are tracked to the end of their lifetime.
2011-03-08T22:39:59  <Frontier> If McLeopold hasn't worked on that yet you'll have to keep track of the ants yourself and assign their moves to the right 'line of output'.
2011-03-08T22:40:39  <sigh> i see
2011-03-08T22:40:41  <Frontier> Basically it is as if each food and ant have an id. And you can find all data to that food/ant by looking up the id.
2011-03-08T22:41:41  <Frontier> From the wiki:  * *a \<owner\> \<start row\> \<start col\> \<start turn\> \<direction list\>* After the food is defined, the ants come into play. Like the food each ant has a single line telling its whole story. \<owner\> is an integer starting at 0 for player 1. \<start row\> and \<start col\> set the location and <\start turn\> in which turn it starts to exist. Note that you can find food converted to ants, by looking up the
2011-03-08T22:42:03  <sigh> anyway, I can't really think about this in detail right now, I'm at work
2011-03-08T22:42:03  <sigh> probably best to get the specs written up somewhere (wiki?) and I'll see what I can do
2011-03-08T22:42:37  <Frontier> I was in the middle of writing them  when git hub went down ^^
