2011-08-04T09:52:11  <GreenTea> Hi all
2011-08-04T09:54:50  <mcstar> ah GreenTea
2011-08-04T09:55:47  <GreenTea> any news / announcements?
2011-08-04T09:57:40  <mcstar> i want around for quite some time
2011-08-04T09:57:44  <mcstar> wasnt
2011-08-04T10:00:51  <GreenTea> i want to find with FlagCapper
2011-08-04T10:00:56  <GreenTea> *fight
2011-08-04T10:03:16  <GreenTea> old bugs are here. bots are plaing on same maps with same opponents.
2011-08-04T10:04:34  <mcstar> i dont want to rush them, i cant deal with aichallenge for a couple of weeks for sure
2011-08-04T10:05:15  <GreenTea> this constest will  never started
2011-08-04T10:05:38  <GreenTea> developers are to passive
2011-08-04T10:06:11  <mcstar> come on, dont blame them, they made these contests in their spare time, with no real financial support
2011-08-04T10:06:13  <GreenTea> they lose interest to project
2011-08-04T10:06:58  <bhasker> people have lives outside of this project and sometimes it catches up
2011-08-04T10:07:13  <bhasker> and the bugs are there for anyone to fix, the code is on github
2011-08-04T10:07:22  <bhasker> if you want to see this launch soon, you can always fix the bugs
2011-08-04T10:07:38  <mcstar> the problem, is that you are EXPECTING it to start, had you not know about the contest, or just have waited for the real start, there would be no problem
2011-08-04T10:07:47  <GreenTea> all people suddenly have no time?
2011-08-04T10:08:02  <GreenTea> i dont belive in that
2011-08-04T10:08:11  <GreenTea> somebody should do something
2011-08-04T10:08:41  * mcstar knows a developer, GreenTea who is more than willing to do something, talk to him
2011-08-04T10:11:59  <GreenTea> im just competitor. not developer of contest..
2011-08-04T10:12:43  <mcstar> yeah, well, its not like re-writing windows, and telling ballmer, i have code to contribute
2011-08-04T10:13:01  <mcstar> this is opensource!(say it like this is SPARTAAA!)
2011-08-04T10:14:54  <GreenTea> i start to hate opensource
2011-08-04T10:16:28  <mcstar> maybe you should befriend the guy who wrote i3
2011-08-04T10:18:04  <mcstar> ah, ion, the i3 is its fork, Tuomo Valkonen, look him up
2011-08-04T10:18:34  <GreenTea> opensource is writen on enthusiasm, if you not have it - all is stoped. Like with this project.. I have enthusiasm to make bot, not to develop contest engine or fix some other bugs...
2011-08-04T10:22:10  <smiley1983> yeah, I've moved on to other projects. I'm looking in every once in a while, and if it actually gets going, maybe I'll put some energy into a bot then...
2011-08-04T10:22:56  <smiley1983> but if someone does have the enthusiasm to pick up this nearly-complete contest framework and complete it, that would be great :)
2011-08-04T10:25:50  <mcstar> i have no doubt that it will launch
2011-08-04T10:26:08  <mcstar> pls observe, that even the wiki is titled Ants 2011 Winter
2011-08-04T10:26:32  <GreenTea> :) yes. this was not a tipo
2011-08-04T10:26:55  <GreenTea> *misprint
2011-08-04T10:27:48  <mcstar> typo
2011-08-04T10:28:32  <mcstar> anyway, you can still develop a killer bot
2011-08-04T10:28:40  <mcstar> just run it against itself

2011-08-04T10:29:30  <_flag> The strangest part is that the contest can basically be launched now (minus a bug or two), and all of a sudden the development has become inactive
2011-08-04T10:29:39  <GreenTea> this is what im doing scince start of beta)
2011-08-04T10:32:15  <mcstar> _flag: im not sure of licencing, but i think that if somebody buys time on the cloud, and steal the codebase, could actually start a counter-contest
