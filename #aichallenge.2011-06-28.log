2011-06-28T01:13:42  <McLeopold> you can make maps with more than 1 valid symmetry as well

2011-06-28T01:14:50  <amstan> antimatroid: only the last one does rotational
2011-06-28T01:15:12  <antimatroid> i include a diagonal flip/transpose as a rotation of a grid
2011-06-28T01:15:26  <antimatroid> including a horizontal/vertical flip
2011-06-28T01:15:36  <antimatroid> then my other maps i call tile/tessellation
2011-06-28T01:15:50  <antimatroid> sorry, i'm terrible at picking names non-mathematicians will understand :P
2011-06-28T01:16:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: soo... when can the maps go up on the server? :P
2011-06-28T01:16:18  <amstan> i'm just saying, you're only doing rotational on the last one, the first 2 are mirrors
2011-06-28T01:17:06  <antimatroid> that's still a rotation :P
2011-06-28T01:17:22  <amstan> if you consider the z axis, sure..
2011-06-28T01:17:46  <antimatroid> that's how people do symmetries of polygons etc :P
2011-06-28T01:18:30  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-06-28T01:19:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: make sure you include command line switches for all the variables of map generation
2011-06-28T01:19:55  <antimatroid> McLeopold: how do i do that? :P
2011-06-28T01:20:03  <McLeopold> import argparse
2011-06-28T01:20:11  <antimatroid> i've set it up so there are constructer functions
2011-06-28T01:20:16  <antimatroid> so it shouldn't be too hard
2011-06-28T01:20:27  <amstan> antimatroid: see the worker script
2011-06-28T01:20:28  <McLeopold> no, that works nicely with switches
2011-06-28T01:24:07  <antimatroid> here's a bunch of maps i generated without throwing any out, do either of you have any complaints/suggestions as to the design of them...?

2011-06-28T02:52:39  <McLeopold> antimatroid: The server will want a list of parameters and the ranges it is allowed to choose.  Integers are best.

2011-06-28T02:53:18  <antimatroid> the feasible parameters changes depending on your type of symmetry
2011-06-28T02:53:29  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-06-28T02:53:32  <antimatroid> like you can only do 2,4,8 player maps for rotationally symmetric maps
2011-06-28T02:54:22  <antimatroid> and if i'm doing a block map, the dimensions need to be divisible by like 2*block_size
2011-06-28T02:54:24  <McLeopold> I would consider them different map generators then.  1 parameter will be 'type'
2011-06-28T02:54:33  <McLeopold> the rest of the parameter list comes from that
2011-06-28T02:55:25  <antimatroid> can't the engine just call the generator for a random map?
2011-06-28T02:55:33  <antimatroid> then deal with the proportions of what types in the map generator
2011-06-28T02:55:36  <antimatroid> i would have thought that'd be easier
2011-06-28T02:56:04  <McLeopold> I want the server to control types generated
2011-06-28T02:56:21  <McLeopold> And to calculate how spread out the parameters will be
2011-06-28T02:56:49  <antimatroid> it's going to need to know all the requirements for what is needed for symmetries to work
2011-06-28T02:56:50  <McLeopold> then different map generators don't need their own logic for spreading out the parameters.
2011-06-28T02:57:43  <McLeopold> Is a list of parameter names and a numeric range for each not good enough?
2011-06-28T02:57:44  <antimatroid> like if you ask for a rotationally symmetric map with a block size of 4 and 10 columns, it's not going to look nice
2011-06-28T02:58:25  <antimatroid> what if i make the min and max levels of these things input parameters?
2011-06-28T02:58:41  <McLeopold> Yes, that's what a range is
2011-06-28T02:58:42  <antimatroid> i have those as fixed parameters atm
2011-06-28T02:58:52  <antimatroid> i'll do that
2011-06-28T02:58:55  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-28T02:59:28  <McLeopold> so, there should be a list of types, and each type has it's own list of parameters, and each parameter has an acceptable range of values
2011-06-28T02:59:45  <antimatroid> yeah, i think i'm good now
2011-06-28T02:59:46  <McLeopold> The "range" can be a list, maybe, like for rot sym, [2, 4, 8]
2011-06-28T03:00:24  <McLeopold> so, tuples for actual ranges, lists for specific values
2011-06-28T03:00:39  <McLeopold> I'll want a get_types function I can call

2011-06-28T03:05:59  <antimatroid> yep sure
2011-06-28T03:06:24  <McLeopold> antimatroid: do you know what sigh did when 2 bots can get to a space at the same time, for food spawning?
2011-06-28T03:06:51  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i can guess
2011-06-28T03:07:18  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-28T03:07:33  <antimatroid> i find a basis, which can be larger than total_land/no_players, because of first access squares, but each square in the basis can't "get to another basis element" by going between the symmetric locations
2011-06-28T03:08:24  <antimatroid> some of the basis elements will have less than n symmetric locations associated, just take the set that doesn't double elements
2011-06-28T03:08:27  <antimatroid> then spawn food on that set
2011-06-28T03:08:30  <antimatroid> does that make sense?
2011-06-28T03:08:45  <McLeopold> uh, so don't spawn in the middle?
2011-06-28T03:08:51  <antimatroid> no you can
2011-06-28T03:08:59  <antimatroid> just spawn 1 food item there, rather than n items
2011-06-28T03:09:17  <antimatroid> same as if you have 4 players, you can spawn on the diagonals, just don't spawn twice on the same location that turn
2011-06-28T03:09:20  <McLeopold> so, a set can be smaller than the number of players
2011-06-28T03:09:24  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-28T03:09:34  <antimatroid> the set of squares symmetrically equivalent to a basis element
2011-06-28T03:09:37  <McLeopold> what if I just queued up 2 foods?
2011-06-28T03:09:48  <antimatroid> and no two basis elements are in the same set of squares that are equivalent to each toehr
2011-06-28T03:10:10  <antimatroid> McLeopold: you could do that, but if one bot gets there then they get an advantage?
2011-06-28T03:10:18  <McLeopold> yeah, they woould
2011-06-28T03:10:18  <antimatroid> and the food spawn info is going from starting locations...
2011-06-28T03:10:24  <antimatroid> i would spawn just 1
2011-06-28T03:10:32  <McLeopold> but, spawning less messes with the spawn rate
2011-06-28T03:10:37  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-28T03:10:44  <antimatroid> can you just queue up locations
2011-06-28T03:10:54  <McLeopold> I have to make sure I have enough middle spawns to equal the number of players
2011-06-28T03:11:23  <antimatroid> i would have a queue of symmetric sets to spawn on
2011-06-28T03:11:23  <McLeopold> It's like a partial set, I have to have enough to make a full set
2011-06-28T03:11:46  <antimatroid> and while the fronts size + spawned food <= amount_to_spawn, spawn from the front?
2011-06-28T03:12:14  <antimatroid> not perfect, but still symmetric?
2011-06-28T03:12:24  <antimatroid> the spawn rate wouldn't be perfectly constant, but close enough
2011-06-28T03:12:27  <McLeopold> I'm saving left over food to spawn, I think I could just play with the rates
2011-06-28T03:12:53  *** gobang <gobang!~gobang@89.204.137.162> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-28T03:13:18  <antimatroid> if you have spawn_rate = 5 food per turn or whatever, then you have amount_to_spawn = turn*spawn_rate, and then keep amount_spawned and a queue of to spawn sets
2011-06-28T03:13:52  <McLeopold> so, I have "total food to spawn", right now I'm doing a mod, but instead I could just pull the next set, which is a variable size, and only spawn if it is not more than leftover food.
2011-06-28T03:14:27  <McLeopold> I think we are saying the same thing...
2011-06-28T03:15:15  <McLeopold> okay, variable sized spawn sets it is, which will be very close to calculating mod, just slightly off if a middle set gets chosen.
2011-06-28T03:15:29  <antimatroid> i don't think blockable regions exist with my maps either
2011-06-28T03:15:40  <antimatroid> they'd be quite rare if they did
2011-06-28T03:15:53  <McLeopold> they are looking nice
2011-06-28T03:16:10  <McLeopold> when I finish the better food spawn code, we can put them on the server
2011-06-28T03:16:20  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-28T03:16:23  <antimatroid> i'm doing a rewrite now

2011-06-28T03:16:32  <antimatroid> i'm going to scrap the random walk stuff
2011-06-28T03:16:40  <McLeopold> I'm glad I did symmetry detection, much better than in the map
2011-06-28T03:16:51  <antimatroid> this is way faster than the symmetric walk stuff too
2011-06-28T03:17:01  <antimatroid> did you see the 1000x1000 map? :P
2011-06-28T03:17:04  <McLeopold> Don't scrap random walk, it's still good

2011-06-28T03:24:15  <antimatroid> another problem is it stalling
2011-06-28T03:24:27  <McLeopold> :(
2011-06-28T03:24:31  <antimatroid> if min_starting_distance is too high, it can't pick starting locations for players
2011-06-28T03:24:35  <McLeopold> like an infinite loop?
2011-06-28T03:24:36  <antimatroid> it's fine if the parameters are alright
2011-06-28T03:24:48  <antimatroid> but if you mess up the parameters, it's just going to loop trying to find starting locations
2011-06-28T03:24:51  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-28T03:25:08  <McLeopold> give it a max tries and raise an error if reached
2011-06-28T03:25:11  <antimatroid> i can make it quit out probably, but you wont get a map back
2011-06-28T03:25:23  <McLeopold> I'll write the map generator stuff to retry on failure
2011-06-28T03:25:45  <McLeopold> As long as you give me parameters that will usually produce a map, it's okay
2011-06-28T03:26:03  <Rabidus> :P
2011-06-28T03:26:03  <McLeopold> I had to tweak min_distance a lot on my cell mazes
2011-06-28T03:26:03  <antimatroid> how do you want errors done?
2011-06-28T03:26:08  <antimatroid> is there a file i can look at? :P
2011-06-28T03:26:41  <McLeopold> no output would be fine
2011-06-28T03:26:58  <McLeopold> I'll just run the map through the symmetric detection to look for failure.
2011-06-28T03:27:08  <antimatroid> easy
2011-06-28T03:27:41  <McLeopold> or, you could restart the map generation yourself, either way
2011-06-28T03:28:13  <antimatroid> can i assume [min,max] players will always include 2, 4 or 8 in its range?
2011-06-28T03:28:22  <McLeopold> no
2011-06-28T03:28:28  <McLeopold> you give me a range, or a list
2011-06-28T03:28:54  <antimatroid> actually, nevermind

Sto003 may become a sort of anchor also. (it's very different from my other bots, but i don't want to work any more on this style of bot)
2011-06-28T04:13:53  <contestbot> stocha: I think that worked...
2011-06-28T04:15:21  <stocha> @later tell antimatroid: what would be could would to be able to use the beta to actually really test my bots. But because of the slow delay before having a trustworthy rank, i would need probably a few dozen account to do that (not that i can't test at home, because i have no free processor time available)
2011-06-28T04:15:21  <contestbot> stocha: Yes master!

2011-06-28T09:27:17  <eashoka> hi All!
2011-06-28T09:29:29  <eashoka> Got to bother you with  a question. sorry if this one is already discussed many times. Why do we have to explicitly call "destinations.add(location)" if we are not moving an Ant (location)? all the sample code has it. can anybody please explain why it's needed ?
2011-06-28T09:34:13  <eashoka> if we are already checking for destination.isOccuied() before an issueOrder, then why do we need to explicitly  keep track of where idle ants are  ?
2011-06-28T09:34:49  <dr-> even if an ant doesn't move, it'll be at some square next turn, so it's a destination in a way
2011-06-28T09:35:13  <dr-> the python function unnocupied just compare the type value of the square
2011-06-28T09:35:41  <dr-> it would be enougth to check
2011-06-28T09:36:55  <gobang>  how would i express 'attackradius2' in a bitboard world ?

2011-06-28T09:37:03  <dr-> checking both occupied square and destination prevent us from colliding ants (moving or not)
2011-06-28T09:42:36  <eashoka> tx <dr>. what I meant was :
2011-06-28T09:44:04  <eashoka> the current tiles of the ants are already marked isn't it. (with the Ilk type) so, if we are not moving the ant, why do we need to specifically remember it's location ?
2011-06-28T09:44:47  <eashoka> the reason is, I'm getting a nasty error 'duplicate order' wonder thether this has something to do with it....

2011-06-28T10:17:26  <contestbot> stocha: Ready to serve.
2011-06-28T10:17:35  <antimatroid> stocha; second that :)
2011-06-28T10:17:51  <antimatroid> i think my map code is finished
2011-06-28T10:17:58  <antimatroid> i'ma put it on github soon
2011-06-28T10:18:54  <stocha> antimatroid: good :) I'm worrying about how much it will impact current game feeling. But you don't progress without some big revolution. I think the maze map, will make the game quite different. Even if it is only one map over ten.
2011-06-28T10:19:22  <antimatroid> stocha: i'm kind of planning to make this the map gen
2011-06-28T10:19:33  <stocha> antimatroid: that would be very bad choice indeed.
2011-06-28T10:19:36  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/MoaTzzro
2011-06-28T10:19:40  <stocha> in my opinion :)
2011-06-28T10:19:44  <antimatroid> that's the map gen atm, with a sample map at the bottom
2011-06-28T10:19:52  <stocha> Map generator choice, is really the main rule choice for the contest.
2011-06-28T10:20:04  <stocha> maz maps are a very particular thing. They lack diversity.
2011-06-28T10:20:32  <antimatroid> stocha: i can tweak the parameters to open the maps up more
2011-06-28T10:20:59  <antimatroid> you'll notice they aren't "perfect mazes"
2011-06-28T10:21:05  <antimatroid> in that there are many paths between some places
2011-06-28T10:21:08  <stocha> antimatroid: let's try to put a few in there. But i doubt people will support the supression of the random walk. Which quite a good game .
2011-06-28T10:21:21  <antimatroid> random walk is a crap strategy
2011-06-28T10:21:29  <stocha> antimatroid: it's your generator, so feel free to make it great :)
2011-06-28T10:21:35  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-590cee59.pool.mediaWays.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-06-28T10:21:58  <stocha> antimatroid: the resulting maps are good. So if you find a better way to have the same set of map, feel free to do it.
2011-06-28T10:22:53  <stocha> What i'm sure of, is that the 100% random walk map, and the 100% maze map  are different kind of ant games.
2011-06-28T10:23:11  <stocha> Winning bot will be different. Efficient features, and best strategy will differ much.
2011-06-28T10:23:36  <stocha> So chosing only one, is really imposing the major rule choice.
2011-06-28T10:23:52  <stocha> But you can mix them (which arguably will make the game even more complicated)
2011-06-28T10:24:21  <stocha> then you'll have to choose the ratio. But i think it's less a game breaker than having 0% of some map types.
2011-06-28T10:24:52  <antimatroid> i think the idea of random walk maps can be better achieved with opening up the maze maps
2011-06-28T10:24:56  <antimatroid> and they look better
2011-06-28T10:25:00  <stocha> antimatroid: put a few labyrinth on the test server (while the old maps in there remains of course)
2011-06-28T10:25:02  <stocha> and see how people react.
2011-06-28T10:25:12  <antimatroid> i can't just do it myself
2011-06-28T10:25:18  <antimatroid> and we need to update the food spawn code
2011-06-28T10:25:23  <antimatroid> once it's ready we'll add a bunch
2011-06-28T10:25:25  <stocha> ah. have the proper person do that then.
2011-06-28T10:25:44  <stocha> when do you think it will be ready ?
2011-06-28T10:26:10  <stocha> it will be very intersting to observer how people react during the first two week of maze adding :)
2011-06-28T10:26:21  <stocha> initially they will be happy.
2011-06-28T10:26:36  <stocha> then some will realize that their bot isn't doing what they though it was doing :p
2011-06-28T10:26:44  <stocha> it will be the interesting point.
2011-06-28T10:27:22  <stocha> That is a major rule change in fact.
2011-06-28T10:27:26  <antimatroid> stocha: http://ants.zeroviz.us/UnQuI/
2011-06-28T10:27:53  <stocha> it looks very nice.
2011-06-28T10:28:05  <stocha> it is however very corridor oriented maps.
2011-06-28T10:28:11  <stocha> can you do very open ones ?
2011-06-28T10:29:02  <stocha> if the contest was using this map generator only, i guess i will have a very big advantage all of a sudden :)
2011-06-28T10:29:12  <stocha> because the corridor map are those i like the best.
2011-06-28T10:29:26  <stocha> But ... a lot of people want to have open maps also. I'm quite sure of that.
2011-06-28T10:29:39  <stocha> with just a few lakes
2011-06-28T10:30:14  <antimatroid> stocha: http://ants.zeroviz.us/kLWoS/
2011-06-28T10:30:17  <stocha> Random walk is very good at diversity. That's why i think it will be nice to still use it. Whatever the percentage. So people don't take too much for granted.
2011-06-28T10:30:20  <antimatroid> you end up with something like that
2011-06-28T10:30:41  <stocha> antimatroid: it's interesting. But certainly not a very open map :)
2011-06-28T10:30:51  <stocha> you should maybe kill some water plans.
2011-06-28T10:31:13  <antimatroid> i could "bomb" patches of the map
2011-06-28T10:31:18  <stocha> but still, it will be different from the random walk generator. Which are good and flexible (but won't generate good maze of course :)   )
2011-06-28T10:31:30  <stocha> antimatroid: yeah. But i think the maze map is really good as it is
2011-06-28T10:31:33  <antimatroid> like, after making the maze, bomb circles in places
2011-06-28T10:31:36  <stocha> it does it's job very well
2011-06-28T10:31:42  <antimatroid> i think the maze mapgen is the way to go though
2011-06-28T10:31:46  <antimatroid> then open maps up from this
2011-06-28T10:31:48  <stocha> (although you need to add open rooms also etc)
2011-06-28T10:31:52  <antimatroid> it's way faster and more reliable too
2011-06-28T10:32:29  <stocha> antimatroid: the random walk generator is very flexible, and good for diversity. I think it's a very important feature. The mazes will add greatly to those properties
2011-06-28T10:32:52  <stocha> because i think good reliably corridor maps are a very usefull addition

2011-06-28T10:33:11  <stocha> antimatroid: assume it will be 50 of each.
2011-06-28T10:33:59  <stocha> antimatroid: if you come up with a yet more diverse and flexible way than the current one, feel free to go there :)   Let's keep the old one in the meantime, and mix it with those corridors
2011-06-28T10:34:10  <stocha> there will probably will be many ways of using your current maze generator.
2011-06-28T10:34:20  <stocha> and then there might be other ways to generate mazes.
2011-06-28T10:34:34  <stocha> (which maybe you will want to dig in through, who knows)
2011-06-28T10:34:57  <stocha> i'm not sure i really understand your algorithm :)

2011-06-28T10:35:33  <stocha> (why is there a grid of lake in the most open maps, that puzzles me :p )
2011-06-28T10:36:20  <stocha> antimatroid: i think i would have done it this way.    Buid 3x3 cells separated by full (1width) lines of water.
2011-06-28T10:37:11  <stocha> antimatroid: then apply the wall painter algorithm. Whenever there is a wall you let the 1width water line be. Where there is not, you remplace it by 1x3 segment of emptyness.
2011-06-28T10:37:32  <stocha> (it would be clearer with a picture maybe :p )
2011-06-28T10:38:09  <stocha> the idea is to apply the algorithm wich revolve about empty cells having four wall. While a cell share all of it's wall with the 4 neighbors.
2011-06-28T10:38:26  <stocha> so walls are 1x3 water. and empty cells are 3x3 emptyness.
2011-06-28T10:39:33  <stocha> obviously, you can make the wall width a parameter. 1x3 walls are hard to carve :)
2011-06-28T10:40:16  <antimatroid> stocha: look at the wikipedia page for maze generation
2011-06-28T10:40:24  <antimatroid> i'm doing the recursive back track algo from there
2011-06-28T10:40:52  <stocha> you do use cells and walls right.
2011-06-28T10:42:16  <stocha> antimatroid: the walls and cells concept are independant of wich algorithm you use :)
2011-06-28T10:42:38  <stocha> antimatroid: i simply says : you can have wall width a parameter. It seems you always your 3 for wall width.
2011-06-28T10:43:05  <antimatroid> stocha: i will experiment with other maze generation algos
2011-06-28T10:43:25  <antimatroid> it should be a matter of replacing the backtrack function in the python thing i linked
2011-06-28T10:43:36  <stocha> antimatroid: make sure there is one that definetly run well with the contest first though :)

2011-06-28T10:47:52  <stocha> UncleVasya: maybe you could generator some 3d form, and slice it for the map ?
2011-06-28T10:48:34  <stocha> Slice map generator. Still you would have to generated a good 3d form. Which i don't want to being to think about

2011-06-28T10:51:07  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: What do you think about PW with map bounds like in ants? I mean when you fly out of top boundary you come to the down.
2011-06-28T10:52:31  <stocha> UncleVasya: I say. Generate a 3d form, with two substance (let's call them gold and iron). Then you slice the 3d form. When you encounter gold, you do a water cell. And when you encounter iron, you do a ground cell. But you would have to have a very special 3d form for it to generate maps. It's most probably not an interesting idea.

2011-06-28T10:59:31  <UncleVasya> Hi,
2011-06-28T10:59:59  <antimatroid> it's REALLY slow if you tell it to generate a tile symmetric map with a specified number of players
2011-06-28T11:00:04  <antimatroid> i dunno how to fix that
2011-06-28T11:00:09  <antimatroid> it's just hard to do that
2011-06-28T11:00:20  <stocha> how slow ?
2011-06-28T11:00:52  <carlop> antimatroid: the most important part of my code is the list of symmetry at row 32
2011-06-28T11:00:57  <antimatroid> not that slow, i will just tell you i failed if it can't find valid parameters within a few seconds
2011-06-28T11:01:09  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: you said ants maps are a toruses so I think torus means "go one direction and you'll come to your starter position from the other side".
2011-06-28T11:01:12  <stocha> UncleVasya: are you an experimented functional developer ?
2011-06-28T11:01:33  <UncleVasya> Anyway, I go to wiki to read about this wotd more.
2011-06-28T11:02:37  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: think of a garden hose, if fold the top and bottom over the back onto each other, you get a cylinder/hose, then if you wrap the hose around into a donut shape (joining the sides) then you get a torus
2011-06-28T11:03:06  <UncleVasya> stocha: My bot is the  "Hello world" for me in the functional world. I've never read functional code before Smiley's satarter pack.
2011-06-28T11:03:26  <stocha> UncleVasya: you have pretty good ranking.
2011-06-28T11:03:39  <UncleVasya> He is expirienced fun-guy and he loves it.
2011-06-28T11:03:51  <carlop> antimatroid: this is an example of 8player symmetry not previously generated: http://ants.zeroviz.us/vhax8/, and this is a list of antpast link for other symmety I can generate: http://pastebin.com/Eq1u00fS
2011-06-28T11:03:56  <UncleVasya> stocha: I have no life :)
2011-06-28T11:04:35  <UncleVasya> So if we compare my time invested to the bot and with others...
2011-06-28T11:04:40  <antimatroid> carlop: that looks nice :)
2011-06-28T11:04:51  <stocha> UncleVasya: is that synonym for divorced ?
2011-06-28T11:05:38  <stocha> UncleVasya: you don't know for sure how much time others have put into this.
2011-06-28T11:06:12  <stocha> there is the time you use for typing. And then all the unsubstantial time your use while you are doing (or supposed to) other stuff. And sleeping etc.
2011-06-28T11:06:28  <stocha> Although to learn a new language, you sort of need a lot of what i call "typing time" :)
2011-06-28T11:07:26  <UncleVasya> ok, your compliment about rankings accepted :)
2011-06-28T11:08:15  <stocha> UncleVasya: i think if you go for  Bot Shown Strength /  time invested    i'd have a chance at the lowest ratio (i guess other will want to try their luck also though :p )
2011-06-28T11:08:53  <stocha> While i suppose that davidjiu would do poorly there :p    With the first version which had a solid 3rd for weeks :p
2011-06-28T11:10:31  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: So what can you say about playing PW on torus. More interesting, less interesting or the same?
2011-06-28T11:10:47  <stocha> UncleVasya: in this game, my bot beated yours :p   http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=43240&user=107

2011-06-28T11:13:29  <UncleVasya> *where
2011-06-28T11:13:50  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: it might make things more complicated
2011-06-28T11:14:02  <antimatroid> i imagine my strategy would be the same with an updated distance metric
2011-06-28T11:14:10  <antimatroid> not that i was ever really that happy with my strategy
2011-06-28T11:14:13  <carlop> antimatroid: generate_basis_information basically understand if symmetry use a triangular / rectangular or square basic tile ?
2011-06-28T11:14:15  <stocha> UncleVasya: yeah, but i had great hope at what stocha is curently Running becoming a Reference bot. And reaching 3rd rank until someone start to want to play with flag and sir_macelon(which i'm not very confidence now but well)
2011-06-28T11:14:49  <antimatroid> carlop: it generates a basis for the set of all squares under symmetry

2011-06-28T11:18:24  <McLeopold> carlop: run "ants.py mapfilename.map" to make sure I can detect your map symmetry
2011-06-28T11:19:00  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it's one of the two player symmetries with the map rotated around 90 degrees each turn

2011-06-28T11:42:07  <antimatroid> particularly as i would need to do it with a 2x2 block
2011-06-28T11:42:13  <antimatroid> 3x3*
2011-06-28T11:42:15  <smiley1983> I then fixed the bug causing them, but it was nice to have the code there as a failsafe
2011-06-28T11:42:22  <stocha> it seems my stocha bot will finally reach 3rd. It's good news because my code is really messy now. While the current Stocha is about as simple as the old ref bot i posted month back on the forum :)
2011-06-28T11:42:28  <stocha> And i need a break.
2011-06-28T11:42:43  <stocha> It's very hard to take the time to really clean up the code.
2011-06-28T11:42:59  <stocha> I just don't find it fun any more. Unless i rewrite in another langage.
2011-06-28T11:43:34  <stocha> But my C version didn't work out too well ... i'm afraid there were uninitialised pointers and that kind of stuff. How do one detect that ?
2011-06-28T11:44:19  <stocha> i'm impressed with those guys that write c bot if only for that. It's so nasty to write in a variable, only to find out (or never to find out) your wrote somewhere else;
2011-06-28T11:45:26  <carlop> antimatroid: you are currently working on your code ? if not, i can add my symmetry generation code and give it back to you
2011-06-28T11:45:48  <antimatroid> i'm just trying to work out what caused that map i just pasted
2011-06-28T11:45:53  <antimatroid> otherwise i'm going to sleep soon
2011-06-28T11:46:19  <UncleVasya> stocha:  I know zeLark (he writes in C). Do you have a questions for him?
2011-06-28T11:47:07  <carlop> ok, when you stop coding, if you want to past here your code i can add xxx_symmetric_grid to your code, so there is a third method (a part of tile and rotationally)
2011-06-28T11:47:07  <stocha> I think i now have 60% of my code, i have no use for. And 20% to 80% is heavilly redundant. But then all my old bots my rely on any piece of it. And i don't want to rewrite them. But i still want to be able to tests the new bot against them.
2011-06-28T11:47:10  <antimatroid> http://ants.zeroviz.us/baCNi/ i finally managed to make another
2011-06-28T11:47:23  <stocha> But i'd like my new bot to use some brand new stuff. Cleaner stuff.
2011-06-28T11:47:53  <carlop> antiamatroid: great maze generator....
2011-06-28T11:48:01  <stocha> UncleVasya: yeah. How do you avoid to write where you don't expect too ? How do you detect initialized pointer into an allocated structure field ?
2011-06-28T11:48:40  <stocha> antimatroid: i like the big highways :p
2011-06-28T11:49:14  <stocha> Anyone has the map of an old symetric medieval town, and willing to put it on the beta server :p
2011-06-28T11:49:33  <stocha> UncleVasya: uninitialized pointers.
2011-06-28T11:50:30  <stocha> UncleVasya: also, in my self testing my bot was working okay. But when i used the communication wrapper for the official engine, it seems it didn't get water right. (mmm, it's hard to help me there i guess :)  )
2011-06-28T11:50:38  <carlop> antimatroid: i think you can leave unconnected component (as the central island in your last pasted map), the only think that is needed is that all player are connected
2011-06-28T11:51:12  <stocha> Do you think it's better to win the contests with a java bot, or with a C bot. All other things being equal ?
2011-06-28T11:53:24  <smiley1983> If I were putting my name on it, I'd prefer C :)

2011-06-28T11:53:53  <UncleVasya> for employers?
2011-06-28T11:54:08  <stocha> C would be good for me. Because i have no proof i can do that well (which maybe i just can't to be fair :p )
2011-06-28T11:54:12  <smiley1983> personal dislike of Java, mostly (not a good reason but true)
2011-06-28T11:54:32  <stocha> smiley1983: so you don't want your name to be associed with java ?
2011-06-28T11:54:42  <stocha> UncleVasya: do employers really need good C programers ?
2011-06-28T11:54:59  <stocha> UncleVasya: i was under the impression that java was everywhere those last .. 15 years :)
2011-06-28T11:55:05  <smiley1983> I also suspect that I would perform better with Java because I would be learning the language in either case, and I'm not accustomed to manual memory management
2011-06-28T11:55:45  <UncleVasya> I don't know/ As I will study 3-4 years more, I don't think about employers :)
2011-06-28T11:55:45  <smiley1983> I'm sure I will write something in Java one day, it's not like I hate the language, but I have a liking for the idea of C which I don't have for Java
2011-06-28T11:56:19  <UncleVasya> stocha: I've copied questions. He needs to go now somewhere and will look on it later.
2011-06-28T11:56:25  <stocha> If i do it in c, i'm about 95% certain i'll will be plagued with a nasty out buffer write. So i don't even want to really try. Although if it was not for this particular problem, i'd go for it most probably.
2011-06-28T11:56:58  <stocha> UncleVasya: okay, i have time :)   I'm pretty sure there exists a way to solve those issues. C is very impractical otherwise :)
2011-06-28T11:57:28  <stocha> UncleVasya: you should. Although for telling what will be in 3-4 years, might be missleading.

2011-06-28T12:05:44  <stocha> smiley1983: is it enougth to pay the internet bill and have a nice computer/ warm place to sleep, food. And maybe childrens ?
2011-06-28T12:06:20  <smiley1983> no children, but all the rest. Since I don't want children and doubt I ever will, I'm happy with that
2011-06-28T12:06:33  <stocha> if so, i guess it's worth it. You'll outlive all of those people spending their days on a chair.
2011-06-28T12:06:43  <stocha> smiley1983: oh. I wanted children so much
2011-06-28T12:07:05  <antimatroid> i'm unsure about children

2011-06-28T12:07:40  <stocha> UncleVasya: i was that. But one who craved for children. For some reason.
2011-06-28T12:08:04  <UncleVasya> stocha: What's their name?
2011-06-28T12:08:13  <stocha> antimatroid: i wanted my own. With the hope of transmiting my broken genes and such

2011-06-28T12:08:36  <stocha> the mother is called Anna also.

2011-06-28T12:09:36  <stocha> antimatroid: i don't want my children to really have my genes; Most of which would be a burden i'm pretty sure :) I just want to think they have. And then that they do everything twice as well as me. (which for a lot of task, is not too much to ask for)
2011-06-28T12:09:42  <UncleVasya> I mean Maya si Lara.
2011-06-28T12:09:59  <stocha> the si stand for "and"
2011-06-28T12:10:03  <antimatroid> i like to think the way i brought a child up would be more important than genes
2011-06-28T12:10:06  <stocha> so it's May and Lara.
2011-06-28T12:10:10  <antimatroid> but both play a role inevitably
2011-06-28T12:10:13  <UncleVasya> ah, ok

2011-06-28T12:11:50  <stocha> So you give them so genes, so at least they now someone to blame for if things don't go as expected.
2011-06-28T12:12:22  <stocha> hey it's a lot like the ant game.
2011-06-28T12:12:54  <stocha> neighboorhood being other bots. And cultural the map they sees :p
2011-06-28T12:13:40  <stocha> My child are home. I'll most probably take a walk with them.
2011-06-28T12:13:51  <stocha> i have had too much of ant and computer for now :p

2011-06-28T18:19:14  <McLeopold> carlop: yes
2011-06-28T18:19:29  <McLeopold> carlop: is this symmetric?
2011-06-28T18:19:48  <carlop> y
2011-06-28T18:19:48  <McLeopold> my current method (which has not been pushed to github) says no
2011-06-28T18:19:54  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-06-28T18:20:07  <carlop> this = ?
2011-06-28T18:20:21  <McLeopold> http://ants.zeroviz.us/LWIWA/
2011-06-28T18:20:26  <McLeopold> forgot the link :)
2011-06-28T18:21:15  <McLeopold> I can't place 1 food item for each player symmetrically.  Either I need 2 per player, or 2 total with overlaps
2011-06-28T18:22:17  <mcstar> you can
2011-06-28T18:22:26  <carlop> there are case where one can't place N unit food/turn for N team
2011-06-28T18:22:43  <mcstar> diagonally in front of an ant?
2011-06-28T18:23:06  <carlop> I think that when generation food one should choose what cell should have food, then give each cell at most a food a time
2011-06-28T18:24:01  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-28T18:24:05  <carlop> think a 7x7 map, with 180 rotation symmetry in the center
2011-06-28T18:24:17  <carlop> and player located in 0,0 and 6,6
2011-06-28T18:24:33  <McLeopold> carlop: I already got that solved with variable length food sets
2011-06-28T18:25:01  <McLeopold> but in that case, the offset for 2 players point to the same square
2011-06-28T18:25:31  <McLeopold> It's the case where I have to double food to place symmetrically that is hard.  I don't think it is worth it
2011-06-28T18:27:16  <carlop> in this case food in (1,3) (1,4) (3,6) and (4,6) is symmetric
2011-06-28T18:28:41  <mcstar> are those 8 or 4 players?
2011-06-28T18:28:44  <carlop> or some of them replaced with the central symmetric one
2011-06-28T18:28:58  <carlop> i think 4 player x 2 ant
2011-06-28T18:29:17  <mcstar> just beacuse they always start with 1 ant per player right?
2011-06-28T18:29:33  <carlop> the possible problem is food in (2,2)*2 times and (2,5)*2 times
2011-06-28T18:29:35  <mcstar> btw theres no point in putting food right next to an ant
2011-06-28T18:29:46  <carlop> in this case you should put only 2 piece of food
2011-06-28T18:30:22  <mcstar> you can put 4 in the center
2011-06-28T18:31:35  <carlop> McLeopold: previously i've wrote a wrong example, the right one is a square with diagonal mirror, all the cell on the mirror axis, with two team
2011-06-28T18:32:31  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-06-28T18:32:35  <carlop> in this case there are turn where you can put only 1 piece of food, cause the symmetry says put double food in one location, and i think this gave too much advantage at the player that control that cell in that moment
2011-06-28T18:33:07  <carlop> symilary here, you want to put 4 food, but 2 location are double, so you put only 2 food this turn
2011-06-28T18:35:01  <McLeopold> what if I want to place food at 2,4?  what are the 3 other symmetric positions?
2011-06-28T18:36:38  <McLeopold> @later tell mleise when the visualizer displays a map, can it also display the food?
2011-06-28T18:36:38  <contestbot> McLeopold: Ready to serve, my lord.
2011-06-28T18:38:46  <carlop> (2,4) (2,3) (3,2) (3,5)
2011-06-28T18:39:03  <carlop> this should be a symmetric group of tile
2011-06-28T18:40:11  <carlop> mmmmh
2011-06-28T18:40:14  <carlop> maybe not
2011-06-28T18:40:26  <mcstar> (2,4) (5,4) (4,2) (3,2)
2011-06-28T18:42:42  <carlop> McLeopold, you are right, the set of symmetric tile can be composed by 8 cell
2011-06-28T18:42:55  <carlop> so sometimes you have to put a lot of food
2011-06-28T18:43:17  <carlop> cause a set of symmetric tile should be symmetric
2011-06-28T18:44:24  <McLeopold> right, I have to double the food amount
2011-06-28T18:44:25  <carlop> the main problem here is that you cant choose 4 starting position and 4 orientation such that there is a symmetry both vertical mirror, orizontal mirror and diagonal mirror
2011-06-28T18:44:42  <McLeopold> so, given a square, I may need a second square for the same player
2011-06-28T18:44:50  <carlop> this is basically a 8 player map, so up to 8 food/turn should be placed
2011-06-28T18:44:53  <mcstar> i know what i proposed doesnt seem symmetric, but it has 1 food tile diagonally away from every kind of ant
2011-06-28T18:44:55  <carlop> yes
2011-06-28T18:45:19  <McLeopold> mcstar: what did you propose?
2011-06-28T18:45:30  <mcstar>  (2,4) (5,4) (4,2) (3,2)
2011-06-28T18:45:43  <carlop> yes, but a symmetric set of cell should be seen at the same way by all player

2011-06-28T18:46:26  <carlop> here the nearest food is 1 square away for each team
2011-06-28T18:46:34  <McLeopold> mcstar: it definatly is not symmetric, although it seems fair, it is not
2011-06-28T18:46:38  <mcstar> look closer, it very fair
2011-06-28T18:47:06  <mcstar> the food is for the same distance for all kind of ants
2011-06-28T18:48:07  <McLeopold> but for 2 players, food is separated, and for 2 it is next to other food
2011-06-28T18:48:10  <mcstar> so, in fact another kind of symmetry can be proposed: the comulative distance for all food must be the same for all players
2011-06-28T18:48:29  <McLeopold> that's not symmetry, that's just a food spawning method
2011-06-28T18:48:50  <mcstar> it is a symmetry of the game, just not geometric symetry
2011-06-28T18:49:10  <McLeopold> 2 players are drawn into conflict while 2 players are separated from conflict, it really isn't fair even though everyone has the same distances to food
2011-06-28T18:50:31  <carlop> yes, I think too there is no symmetry for 4 team
2011-06-28T18:50:47  <mcstar> well, as i see it, it is unfeasible to think this over for every kind of situation
2011-06-28T18:51:23  <carlop> but there are a lot of map that can guarantee the "right" symmetry
2011-06-28T18:51:35  <mcstar> did you get complaints recently about food spawning fairness?
2011-06-28T18:55:52  <carlop> i'm not sure of what is your point....
2011-06-28T18:56:52  <carlop> i think that food spawning/map generation is fair, but i don't think that we can make it less fair without any advantage
2011-06-28T18:56:59  <mcstar> mine? my point is only that i thought map generating/food spawning was already done
2011-06-28T18:57:18  <McLeopold> no, it's not done
2011-06-28T18:57:29  <McLeopold> There's an issue on github, which is what I'm working on
2011-06-28T18:58:49  <mcstar> carlopi's issue?
2011-06-28T19:01:32  <carlop> i think that possibly some map can have asymmetric map/spawning, cause i see a potential exploitable thing in revealing to the player that the map should always be symmetrical (cause one can understand the type of symmetry and then know land/water of unexplored land)
2011-06-28T19:01:46  <carlop> but this is another think
2011-06-28T19:02:17  <carlop> currently i'm building symmetry generator, can be useful have more symmetry than the currently used

2011-06-28T23:07:13  <_flag> Is Trueskill deliberately trying to stop me from reaching 100 or is that just because macelon is falling (or something else)?
2011-06-28T23:07:20  <antimatroid> the bots who make use of information outside of view will not shine through as apparently because other bots will continue seeing an item while they track to it
2011-06-28T23:07:30  <antimatroid> any path finding bot is going to walk all over some kind of random strategy bot anyway
