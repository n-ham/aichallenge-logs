2011-07-16T07:55:50  <contestbot> mcstar: Yep.
2011-07-16T07:57:32  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i think with a decent map that is pretty unlikely to happen
2011-07-16T07:57:45  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: and even if it does, what's available to one bot is available to all (assuming symmetry)
2011-07-16T07:58:03  <jmcarthur> with hills, i think symmetry is more important, relative to with scores instead

2011-07-16T10:08:33  <mcstar> that red X must be very tempting to you :)
2011-07-16T10:08:55  <bhasker> yup i did
2011-07-16T10:09:07  <bhasker> most of my query functions i rewrote to be more efficient
2011-07-16T10:09:11  <mcstar> im glad
2011-07-16T10:09:17  <bhasker> especially all the find in radius kind of functions
2011-07-16T10:09:33  <bhasker> haven't had a single timeout since i fixed that
2011-07-16T10:09:53  <mcstar> i had trouble with a recursive logic, it took too much time when my bot had many ants
2011-07-16T10:10:17  <mcstar> im not sure if it was a bug, or a design-failure
2011-07-16T10:10:17  <bhasker> ah k
2011-07-16T10:11:04  <jmreardon> I've avoided doing much logic on a per-ant basis; My runtime is mostly bound by map size
2011-07-16T10:11:48  <mcstar> jmreardon: is your bot "board" oriented?
2011-07-16T10:11:53  <mcstar> board=map
2011-07-16T10:11:55  <bhasker> oriented?
2011-07-16T10:12:09  <mcstar> well, if it uses a representation of the map/board often
2011-07-16T10:12:29  <jmreardon> umm, I guess, I'll explain the basics if you like
2011-07-16T10:12:31  <mcstar> for example mine is rather ant based, it doesnt use the board
2011-07-16T10:12:43  <mcstar> sure
2011-07-16T10:12:52  <mcstar> not in detail, just roughly :)
2011-07-16T10:14:28  <jmreardon> so, when I start my turn, I construct a series of 2d int arrays; then for each ant, they inspect the nearby values on these arrays in a set order, whenever the ant find an adjacent value on the array that is valid and lower than the value of it's current location, it moves to that lower location
2011-07-16T10:14:52  <jmreardon> so my ants' behaviour is entirely determined by how I construct the arrays
2011-07-16T10:15:23  <bhasker> ah mine uses the board for most things
2011-07-16T10:15:44  <bhasker> i just use my ant array to iterate over the ants thats about it
2011-07-16T10:15:49  <bhasker> almost every thing else uses the board
2011-07-16T10:16:06  <bhasker> so my queries like find ants in radius X etc use the board exclusively
2011-07-16T10:16:28  <jmreardon> for example, one array is for collecting food, in that array, I run a floodfill (avoiding water), starting from a food tile (which has value 0), each tile further from the food has a value one greater than the next tile
2011-07-16T10:16:39  <mcstar> jmreardon: how do you initialize those arrays? do they get the values from a master map?
2011-07-16T10:17:26  <mcstar> i see, squares has distance values
2011-07-16T10:17:30  <mcstar> have
2011-07-16T10:17:48  <jmreardon> the arrays are initialized to 2^32-1; currently the flood fill code avoids water, and assumes anything else is land
2011-07-16T10:18:11  <mcstar> jmreardon: im just curious, why do you need many arrays?
2011-07-16T10:18:21  <mcstar> more than 1 actually
2011-07-16T10:18:47  <mcstar> is it because you use haskell?
2011-07-16T10:18:49  <jmreardon> because I want my ants to do many things; and it is easier to represent in multiple arrays than get the logic right to fill one array
2011-07-16T10:19:13  <bhasker> jmreardon, so you flood fill the array to get distance to closest food from any square is that it?
2011-07-16T10:19:18  <jmreardon> no, my code (well the array stuff at least) isn't terribly functional anyways
2011-07-16T10:19:30  <jmreardon> bhasker: no, I have an array for everything my ants do
2011-07-16T10:19:36  <bhasker> ah k
2011-07-16T10:19:45  <jmreardon> (ok, except staying still)
2011-07-16T10:20:15  <jmreardon> one for food, one for attacking, running away, searching, and spreading out (currently at least)
2011-07-16T10:20:20  <bhasker> ah k
2011-07-16T10:20:32  <mcstar> multiplied this by the number of ants, right?
2011-07-16T10:20:34  <bhasker> i just have one array and i use ancillary structures and query functions to decide per ant what to do
2011-07-16T10:20:49  <bhasker> no i am guessing his array is a 2d array of the map
2011-07-16T10:21:05  <jmreardon> some of them (like running away) don't have distance values, since I want them going in the opposite direction
2011-07-16T10:21:28  <jmreardon> mcstar: no, one array of each sort is constructed per turn, and it covers the entire map
2011-07-16T10:22:00  <mcstar>  I construct a series of 2d int arrays; then for each ant,
2011-07-16T10:22:04  <jmreardon> so, I floodfill from each food tile all at the same time, on the same array, any every ant uses that array
2011-07-16T10:22:07  <mcstar> i misunderstood this line :D
2011-07-16T10:22:39  <jmreardon> ah, no, each ant inspects the same arrays after they are constructed
2011-07-16T10:23:16  <bhasker> i am guessing when you floodfill you overwrite any squares till they have the lowest number?
2011-07-16T10:23:23  <jmreardon> makes it hard to do some clever things like have only one ant go for a food tile, but it scales well
2011-07-16T10:24:09  <bhasker> in other news the amazon micro instances are pretty snappy cpu wise
2011-07-16T10:24:13  <bhasker> just limited to 612 mb of ram
2011-07-16T10:25:12  <jmreardon> no, for the floodfill, when the "boundaries" come against each other, I stop floodfilling. the algorithm does the fill breadth-first, so it generally gets the right answer anyways
2011-07-16T10:25:31  <bhasker> ah k
2011-07-16T10:25:48  <jmreardon> and I only floodfill for a certain distance, no point having an ant half the map away running for some food
2011-07-16T10:26:46  <bhasker> ah k
2011-07-16T10:29:31  <mcstar> i a bit envy the C guys for their fast arrays
2011-07-16T10:29:42  <mcstar> and fast floating point math
2011-07-16T10:33:28  <jmreardon> mcstar: surely lisp has access to some sort of reasonably fast arrays? (I've only used Scheme, and not much at that)
2011-07-16T10:34:10  <mcstar> well, in the sbcl manual they say, that 2d arrays are generally slow
2011-07-16T10:34:18  <mcstar> so i use 1d arrays
2011-07-16T10:34:38  <mcstar> and have functions which translate between 1 and 2 index accesses
2011-07-16T10:35:49  *** chris__0076 is now known as chris_0076
2011-07-16T10:36:09  <mcstar> i had to get my coffee
2011-07-16T10:36:27  <mcstar> and in lisp numbers are boxed
2011-07-16T10:36:52  <mcstar> so you have to explicitely tell the compiler when you want to use unboxed floats/ints
2011-07-16T10:37:05  <jmreardon> ic
2011-07-16T10:38:15  <mcstar> is haskell's array access times comparable to c's?
2011-07-16T10:39:03  <jmreardon> my understanding is that you can get somewhat close if you want to
2011-07-16T10:39:33  <jmreardon> but I don't know much about optimizing array usage in ghc
2011-07-16T10:39:37  <bhasker> heh main reason i picked c++ rather than python for this contest
2011-07-16T10:40:02  <bhasker> last contest i had used python and ran into multiple issues with performance of objects etc
2011-07-16T10:40:11  <bhasker> had to rewrite a bunch of crap to use tuples etc
2011-07-16T10:40:19  <bhasker> makes for highly unreadable code
2011-07-16T10:45:26  <mcstar> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/ i think this is a good site to get some performance tips
2011-07-16T10:46:41  <jmreardon> mcstar: are you hitting performance issues that much?
2011-07-16T10:47:19  <mcstar> no :D, but its a good place to learn
2011-07-16T10:53:24  <mcstar> this shows clearly my ignorance, but what im surprised at, is how well java does on those test, with so little obfuscation
2011-07-16T10:53:33  <mcstar> tests
2011-07-16T10:54:17  <jmreardon> java has improved quite a bit over the last decade
2011-07-16T10:56:01  <mcstar> unfortunately Clojure has a factor of 2 disadvantage
2011-07-16T10:59:57  <jmreardon> unfortunately clojure doesn't fit into the mold the jvm works well with so much

2011-07-16T15:35:41  <mcstar> @later tell mleise i could stand that firefox kept opening up(i think the webbrowser module is not working when no desktop environment is loaded) so i added a subprocess.call to visualize_locally
2011-07-16T15:35:41  <contestbot> mcstar: I think that worked...
2011-07-16T15:36:02  <mcstar> @later tell mleise couldn't
2011-07-16T15:36:02  <contestbot> mcstar: Aye, aye, sir

2011-07-16T16:21:54  <mleise> mcstar: the fog of war is an expensive overlay that I only update once a turn. It is the same that the players see at the start of that turn.
2011-07-16T16:23:17  <mcstar> mleise: it seem as if it was lagging behind the ants
2011-07-16T16:23:25  <mcstar> it was kind of annyoing for me
2011-07-16T16:23:50  <mcstar> its not a big deal, but id like that the fog moves in synchron with the ants
2011-07-16T16:25:12  <mleise> that's not going to happen, sorry. it is too computationally expensive :)
2011-07-16T16:26:27  <mcstar> there must be some misunderstanding, maybe on my part, but i dont get why would it be "expensive"
2011-07-16T16:29:37  <mleise> mcstar: btw visualize_locally is McLeopold's work. I don't know Python. I haven't even used visualize_locally yet. I only know the flag for playgame.py to suppress opening a browser window
2011-07-16T16:30:30  <mcstar> well, he then, imports a module called webbrowser, i suppose the problem lies there
2011-07-16T16:30:53  <mcstar> mleise: pls lets figure out if we were talking about the same thing or not
2011-07-16T16:31:46  <mleise> For the fog of war you have to calculate the visible squares for every ant that takes some time
2011-07-16T16:33:09  <mcstar> i guess what id like, is that you move the fog before the ant
2011-07-16T16:33:10  <mcstar> thats all
2011-07-16T16:33:29  <mcstar> i dont want you to animate the fog
2011-07-16T16:34:54  <mleise> ok i see. well in that case I'll talk with amstan, antimatroid or McLeopold to get a broader set of opinions on that. Until now I liked the fog to change at the start of the turn as it did when the game was run.
2011-07-16T16:36:36  <mcstar> anyway, its not a big problem(maybe not a problem at all), i usually dont "Play" the replay, but i use the upper slider
2011-07-16T16:41:26  <mcstar> this is horrible, the village i live in must have some kind of "Village Day", and they play some horrible "music" loudly on the football-field

2011-07-16T16:45:21  <mcstar> i think i wrote an intelligent snake
2011-07-16T16:45:47  <mcstar> lets define "intelligence" this way: spontaneous, autonomous behaviour
2011-07-16T16:46:22  <mcstar> when theres no food around, this test version should stay still, but somehow,it reorganizes itself
2011-07-16T16:46:24  <mcstar> hehe

2011-07-16T16:53:12  <jbrechtel> Anyone got the link to that tcp server on github for ants?
2011-07-16T16:54:52  <mcstar> as far as i know it isnt in a usable condition
2011-07-16T16:58:30  <jbrechtel> really?  flag was mentioning running games on it last week
2011-07-16T16:59:29  <jbrechtel> fwiw, this is what I was looking for: https://github.com/berak/ants-tcp
2011-07-16T17:00:14  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-16T17:00:21  <mcstar> but its quite bad yet
2011-07-16T17:00:34  <mcstar> for example doesnt report water, when it should and such
2011-07-16T17:00:48  <mcstar> i havent used it, but this is what i heard
2011-07-16T17:01:43  <jbrechtel> ah
2011-07-16T17:01:50  <jbrechtel> that would indeed be unfortunate

2011-07-16T17:14:20  <bhasker> when the cutoff happens
2011-07-16T17:15:13  <bhasker> or the cutoff needs to be amended where its a consistent difference in both score and ants
