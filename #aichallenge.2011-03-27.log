2011-03-27T00:00:05  <sigh> antimatroid: why is that?
2011-03-27T00:00:27  <antimatroid> it happens when you have the edge with a wall longer than 1 square i tihnk

2011-03-27T00:00:33  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure that breaks it
2011-03-27T00:01:26  <antimatroid> sigh: how do you plan to fix it now? :P

2011-03-27T00:05:32  <spacebat> is there a doc describing what the conflict resolution rules are?
2011-03-27T00:05:35  <antimatroid> spacebat: do check the specifications page https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-27T00:05:38  <spacebat> thanks
2011-03-27T00:05:44  <antimatroid> there is a link the the proposed options on that page
2011-03-27T00:05:55  <antimatroid> and please do give us your feedback :)

2011-03-27T00:06:53  <antimatroid> yeah same, it's a great game
2011-03-27T00:06:58  <antimatroid> i got into pw right at the start though
2011-03-27T00:07:46  <spacebat> my coworkers were using the perl starter pack and some of them timed out with too many fleets in flight
2011-03-27T00:07:57  <antimatroid> spacebat: what language do you use?
2011-03-27T00:08:08  <spacebat> but I used it as an excuse to learn CLOS better in common lisp
2011-03-27T00:08:21  <antimatroid> :)
2011-03-27T00:08:50  <spacebat> there was no worry about timing out at least with my puny tactics
2011-03-27T00:09:09  <spacebat> hopefully there will be a more recent version of SBCL this time around
2011-03-27T00:09:40  <antimatroid> i don't know much (anything) about that kind of stuff, but people have been discussing updating things like that

2011-03-27T00:23:14  <janzert> ssh down too?
2011-03-27T00:23:21  <amstan> so.. it must be the hardware, i don't have access to that

2011-03-27T00:23:32  <amstan> contestbot: ping ai-contest.com
2011-03-27T00:23:32  <contestbot> pong
2011-03-27T00:23:38  <Stocha> How is the engine going. I saw a lot of talk about speed and optimization and so on. That i'm not sure i understood anything out of.
2011-03-27T00:23:51  <janzert> or datacenter network
2011-03-27T00:23:53  <antimatroid> our get_vision is broken
2011-03-27T00:23:54  <amstan> Stocha: ask Mcleopold, he's in charge of that
2011-03-27T00:23:57  <antimatroid> we're trying to work out how to fix it
2011-03-27T00:24:10  <Stocha> what does get_vision do ?
2011-03-27T00:24:18  <amstan> janzert: he's hard rebooting it
2011-03-27T00:24:31  <antimatroid> simultaneously paints out from a bots ants to find "visible" squares
2011-03-27T00:24:32  <janzert> ok
2011-03-27T00:24:37  <Frontier> Dev.Opera suggests using "new String('text');" instead of "'text'" when you want to call methods on the string, as the raw type will have to be converted to an object for every single call otherwise. I really missed that when I wrote the parser.
2011-03-27T00:24:45  <Stocha> do you do that bitmap based ?
2011-03-27T00:24:51  <Stocha> or integer based ?
2011-03-27T00:24:57  <antimatroid> ?
2011-03-27T00:25:07  <Stocha> I think i'm doing the same. But i'm not sure
2011-03-27T00:25:21  <Stocha> i didn't cared optimizing it, because it was already quite fast.
2011-03-27T00:25:36  <Stocha> so i'm not sure i understand what's doing on in there :p
2011-03-27T00:25:37  <antimatroid> the naive way of doing that efficiently breaks with euclidean metric
2011-03-27T00:25:48  <Stocha> what do you mean ?
2011-03-27T00:25:54  <Stocha> what's the naive way ?
2011-03-27T00:25:58  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/gscdvw3u
2011-03-27T00:26:01  <Stocha> you mean x2+y2=c ?
2011-03-27T00:26:38  <sigh> Stocha: no, he means the algorithm that used to be in the engine, the breadth-first search one
2011-03-27T00:27:01  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold here is a simple demonstration of vision breaking: http://pastebin.com/gscdvw3u
2011-03-27T00:27:01  <contestbot> sigh: I come to serve.
2011-03-27T00:27:41  <sigh> antimatroid: I can't see how that example would fail?
2011-03-27T00:27:50  <sigh> antimatroid: http://pastebin.com/QCsFFiY4 <--- this example
2011-03-27T00:28:37  <Stocha> i'm far from sure i understand what the problem is.
2011-03-27T00:28:53  <Stocha> I though a painting view would be aimed at known what an ant can see.
2011-03-27T00:29:01  <Stocha> Or what a team of ant can see.
2011-03-27T00:29:09  <Stocha> I see no way of getting wrong there.
2011-03-27T00:29:22  <Stocha> Or i totally missed a subtlety
2011-03-27T00:29:34  <Stocha> Or i missed what this is about entirely :p
2011-03-27T00:29:36  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold the starter packs should have the simple by_ants method, we KNOW it works and it is not much slower. It is also much harder to patch starter packs that people have downloaded if there is a bug
2011-03-27T00:29:36  <contestbot> sigh: OK
2011-03-27T00:29:53  <sigh> Stocha: both ants are on the same team
2011-03-27T00:29:56  <sigh> in that example
2011-03-27T00:30:22  <sigh> the numbers are just to differentiate how each square is reached by the algorithm
2011-03-27T00:30:42  <Stocha> do you mean that you have a function wich for a team_of_ant returns a set of seen squares; And that it doesn't work ?
2011-03-27T00:31:02  <sigh> yes
2011-03-27T00:31:27  <Stocha> can you link me to the method, so i can have a look at the code ? :p
2011-03-27T00:31:43  <janzert> we also have algorithms that do work :)
2011-03-27T00:31:51  <janzert> sigh: looking at your latest now
2011-03-27T00:32:01  <Stocha> why is the one that doesn't work important then ?
2011-03-27T00:32:03  <janzert> trying to wrap my head around what it's doing anyway :)
2011-03-27T00:32:06  <sigh> janzert: don't bother, it doesn't work either
2011-03-27T00:32:09  <janzert> oh
2011-03-27T00:32:27  <Stocha> I do have a straight algorithm that is working.
2011-03-27T00:32:34  <janzert> there are some pathological cases where the current one that works is slow
2011-03-27T00:32:38  <sigh> janzert: and interestingly it breaks in a way your tests don't catch
2011-03-27T00:32:39  <Stocha> Although i don't know if it would go well with python :p
2011-03-27T00:32:57  <janzert> heh, really it takes more than two ants to break it?
2011-03-27T00:33:11  <sigh> a.x
2011-03-27T00:33:13  <sigh> .b.
2011-03-27T00:33:14  <sigh> ..a
2011-03-27T00:33:27  <sigh> vr2 = 2
2011-03-27T00:33:44  <janzert> ahh, I wondered earlier about that case when I couldn't get the other one to break with vr2=6
2011-03-27T00:33:50  <sigh> b can see x but is blocked because the a's reach the adjacent squares first

2011-03-27T00:34:42  <Stocha> what i use i think is : for(int x=0;x<square2;x++)
2011-03-27T00:34:55  <Stocha> for(int y=0;y<square2;y++)
2011-03-27T00:35:09  <sigh> essentially my method sets up a priority queue ordered by euclidean distance (instead of manhattan distance)... and this example shows that still fails

2011-03-27T00:35:25  <sigh> Stocha: yes, that works, that's what is in the engine now
2011-03-27T00:35:38  <Stocha> what's wrong about it ?
2011-03-27T00:35:48  <sigh> nothing, we thought we had a faster method
2011-03-27T00:35:50  <Stocha> you can optimize it a lot also
2011-03-27T00:35:59  <Stocha> although i had no reason to do so yet
2011-03-27T00:36:17  <Stocha> it's pretty much the fastest method i know.
2011-03-27T00:36:33  <sigh> Stocha: it becomes slow when a lot of ants are packed together
2011-03-27T00:36:36  <Stocha> because you can go with clever tricks about incrementaly computing x2 and y2
2011-03-27T00:36:41  <janzert> it takes O((viewradius*2)**2 * num_ants) time
2011-03-27T00:36:46  <sigh> because you check the same square multiple times
2011-03-27T00:36:49  <Stocha> ah
2011-03-27T00:36:49  <janzert> of course the constant is very low
2011-03-27T00:36:56  <Stocha> i see
2011-03-27T00:37:11  <Stocha> Of course i used 64 bits integer to get it go faster with many ants.
2011-03-27T00:37:46  <Stocha> Although i got slower the larger the map is.
2011-03-27T00:37:57  <janzert> I still think it should be possible to do O(number_of_squares_in_view) but the question is if the constant overhead can be low enough
2011-03-27T00:38:05  <Stocha> How many ants can you support at the moment ?
2011-03-27T00:38:30  <sigh> janzert: yes, I have a candidate, but it is more complicated
2011-03-27T00:38:49  <janzert> great :)
2011-03-27T00:38:57  <Stocha> why are you doing optimization when the engine has not been finished yet ?
2011-03-27T00:39:19  <janzert> the engine itself is basically finished
2011-03-27T00:39:23  <Stocha> although maybe it's just fun.
2011-03-27T00:39:28  <janzert> all the supporting stuff isn't
2011-03-27T00:39:31  <sigh> it's just interesting
2011-03-27T00:39:36  <Stocha> okay
2011-03-27T00:39:36  <janzert> and yeah, it's an interesting thing to look at
2011-03-27T00:39:48  <sigh> I thnk the current method in the engine is fine
2011-03-27T00:39:50  <sigh> janzert: http://pastebin.com/j52RzXfw <-- forgive the duplicated code
2011-03-27T00:40:03  <Stocha> So want something linear into the number of seen squares ?
2011-03-27T00:40:04  <sigh> antimatroid pasted a case, but I can't see how that breaks this
2011-03-27T00:40:14  <antimatroid> sigh: sorry trying to catch up on the convo
2011-03-27T00:40:17  <antimatroid> got caught on the phone
2011-03-27T00:40:24  <sigh> antimatroid: no worries
2011-03-27T00:41:04  <Stocha> what did you try ?
2011-03-27T00:42:33  <antimatroid> sigh: ignore my example, i think your new method works
2011-03-27T00:42:54  <sigh> I think it works too, but I've been wrong a few times now :)
2011-03-27T00:43:07  <antimatroid> yes, i think it works for everything that's broken stuff so far :)
2011-03-27T00:43:28  <sigh> hehe
2011-03-27T00:43:39  <sigh> man, should start making unit tests for this
2011-03-27T00:45:32  <Stocha> what testing strategy would you use ?
2011-03-27T00:45:44  <janzert> and it takes half the time of by_ant for a 10x10 ant grid with a spacing of 1
2011-03-27T00:45:45  <janzert> nice
2011-03-27T00:45:58  <Stocha> I'm not sure i underestood the idea behind the algo yet
2011-03-27T00:47:30  <Stocha> i guess i do not understand python wel :p
2011-03-27T00:47:34  <sigh> Stocha: search squares outwards from all ants simultaneously using a priority queue where squares are weighted by Euclidean distance
2011-03-27T00:48:09  <sigh> this is not the most pedagogical example to look at, it's the end result of me hacking on fixes till it worked :P
2011-03-27T00:48:14  <antimatroid> sigh: you can just use a queue i'm pretty sure
2011-03-27T00:48:37  <sigh> priority queue is more correct
2011-03-27T00:48:58  <antimatroid> do they have much difference in speed?
2011-03-27T00:49:34  <Stocha> what is a square weighted by euclidiant distance ? means squares are given a value equal to distance from closest ant ?
2011-03-27T00:49:44  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-27T00:49:56  <sigh> oh I thought you were just taking issue with the name. priority queue is the name of an abstract data structure, it says nothing about implementation
2011-03-27T00:50:15  <sigh> the actual code uses stacks at the core
2011-03-27T00:50:30  <sigh> but overall it implements a priority queue
2011-03-27T00:50:32  <Stocha> What's the idea for weighting the squares then ?
2011-03-27T00:50:46  <Stocha> it doesn't sound easy to do, that weighting
2011-03-27T00:50:59  <antimatroid> so you don't repeatedly check the same visibly square more than once
2011-03-27T00:51:17  <Stocha> how do you obtain the weight matrix ?
2011-03-27T00:51:27  <Stocha> or just the weight i mean.
2011-03-27T00:51:35  <antimatroid> you build it as you search
2011-03-27T00:51:52  <Stocha> i don't get the linearity of it yet.
2011-03-27T00:51:58  <sigh> Stocha: when you reach a square you are guaranteed that it was reached the fastest way
2011-03-27T00:52:14  <janzert> sigh: the horizontal directions loop and diagonal directions loop are identical right?
2011-03-27T00:52:20  <antimatroid> the problem with the naive way was it didn't guarantee you reached it the fastest way
2011-03-27T00:52:21  <janzert> just double checking before I combine it
2011-03-27T00:52:26  <sigh> janzert: yes, they are
2011-03-27T00:52:55  <sigh> janzert: they can't be done at the same time though
2011-03-27T00:53:07  <janzert> yeah, just found that out :P
2011-03-27T00:53:10  <sigh> :D
2011-03-27T00:53:34  <Stocha> So you point outward from every-ant, and put a weight to each squared reach then.
2011-03-27T00:54:31  <sigh> Stocha: what language are you most familiar with?
2011-03-27T00:54:41  <Stocha> java i guess
2011-03-27T00:55:05  <Stocha> or anything using int[] and while loops :p
2011-03-27T00:55:25  <sigh> hmm... antimatroid you have a c++ impl of vision?
2011-03-27T00:55:52  <Stocha> i have always been bad at reading code also i guess :p
2011-03-27T00:55:53  <antimatroid> not the new one
2011-03-27T00:55:58  <antimatroid> i have an old one somewhere
2011-03-27T00:56:19  <Stocha> So we still might discuss the raw algorithms anyway
2011-03-27T00:56:39  <sigh> actually, have a look at this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/python/ants.py#L198
2011-03-27T00:56:43  <Stocha> i don't see where there is a cutoff
2011-03-27T00:56:57  <sigh> this is the old broken one, but it is well commented and the idea is the same
2011-03-27T00:57:19  <antimatroid> Stocha: http://pastebin.com/VmzKyGhv
2011-03-27T00:57:41  <sigh> and there's a c++ version :)
2011-03-27T00:59:22  <antimatroid> i don't think there exists a screen wide enough for me :(
2011-03-27T00:59:47  <sigh> :P
2011-03-27T01:00:47  <antimatroid> imagine going back to <20" crts :\
2011-03-27T01:01:29  <janzert> so at likely common game ant spacing by_ant is still the fastest correct method :/
2011-03-27T01:01:29  <sigh> I'm working on my 15" laptop just fine :P
2011-03-27T01:01:36  <sigh> janzert: yes
2011-03-27T01:02:11  <antimatroid> we could always use a different metric
2011-03-27T01:02:49  <Stocha> i used to have MacPlus when i first learned turbopascal and c.
2011-03-27T01:02:50  <sigh> janzert: if you want to get really hacky, you can update vision can be a count instead of a boolean, and you update it as a ant moves or dies/spawns
2011-03-27T01:02:55  <Stocha> the screen was not that big.
2011-03-27T01:03:23  <Stocha> I didn't grab the principle of the algorithm
2011-03-27T01:03:28  <janzert> you're meaning incrementally update it?
2011-03-27T01:03:34  <Stocha> is there an article somewhere describing the principle ?
2011-03-27T01:03:34  <sigh> janzert: when an ant moves you only need to update the difference of the previous and new vision
2011-03-27T01:03:37  <janzert> yeah, that would be an option
2011-03-27T01:03:37  <sigh> janzert: yes
2011-03-27T01:03:50  <sigh> but then the vision code leaks out into the entire engine
2011-03-27T01:03:57  <Stocha> ah so it's based over ant movement ?
2011-03-27T01:04:11  <Stocha> between turns.
2011-03-27T01:04:13  <janzert> and although it spreads the cost out I'm not sure it would actually be faster?
2011-03-27T01:04:17  <antimatroid> Stocha: my tron bot was based around it
2011-03-27T01:04:22  <sigh> janzert: why not?
2011-03-27T01:04:30  <janzert> I'm assuming most all ants will move every turn
2011-03-27T01:04:42  <Stocha> there was an euclidian distance in tron ?
2011-03-27T01:04:45  <janzert> you still have to do the same work per ant right?
2011-03-27T01:04:46  <antimatroid> no
2011-03-27T01:04:46  <sigh> kill/spawn ant is O(visionradius**2), moving an ant is O(visionradius)
2011-03-27T01:04:59  <antimatroid> this works for movement as well, you just block your search with water
2011-03-27T01:05:42  <antimatroid> the evauluation function for my tron bot for non wins/loses was basically to do the difference between the number of squares each player could reach first
2011-03-27T01:06:31  <antimatroid> you don't want to see the code for that, i'm not even sure i still have it, but it was all in one file and just awful
2011-03-27T01:06:56  <Stocha> i'm more interested into grabbing the principle.
2011-03-27T01:07:30  <antimatroid> hang on
2011-03-27T01:07:32  <janzert> in any case incremental updating seems like it would get messy
2011-03-27T01:07:38  <Stocha> So it's like, for each ant you maintain a list of seen squares.
2011-03-27T01:07:55  <Stocha> then you try to update this list when the ant moves.
2011-03-27T01:08:30  <janzert> Stocha: if you were to go with an incrementally update version it would be something like that yes
2011-03-27T01:08:39  <janzert> but we're not really looking at that
2011-03-27T01:08:40  <Stocha> the obvious way being applying a translation to it
2011-03-27T01:08:49  <Stocha> but a simple translation wouldn't speed things
2011-03-27T01:09:01  <Stocha> that you have to build a clever way to do the translation ?
2011-03-27T01:09:25  <Stocha> so the question would be : what is the clever way of doint that translation then ? :p
2011-03-27T01:09:50  <antimatroid> Stocha: http://pastebin.com/mRfSG8hi
2011-03-27T01:09:50  <Stocha> or maybe you don't update the points in the list
2011-03-27T01:09:55  <sigh> janzert: yes, which is why I said that it was hacky :P
2011-03-27T01:09:59  <Stocha> maybe you update the list itself
2011-03-27T01:10:19  <antimatroid> the numbers are squares that will go onto the queue before any number greater than it, but not necessarily in any order for the same number
2011-03-27T01:10:40  <antimatroid> if you paint a grid like that with all ants, you can use the numbers from a "target square" to backtrack a shortest path as well
2011-03-27T01:11:13  <spacebat> I'm thinking it would be best to have a 2 dimensional array for the points, that in each dimension is like a circular buffer
2011-03-27T01:11:17  <sigh> janzert: if vr2=96, then vision is 293 squares per ant, but symmetric difference between adjacent visions is only 38
2011-03-27T01:11:34  <sigh> if you want concrete numbers :)
2011-03-27T01:11:36  <Stocha> so you want to build the distance to closest ant matrix really.
2011-03-27T01:11:37  <spacebat> instead of moving cells within the grid, you change the start/end coordinats
2011-03-27T01:11:57  <spacebat> and update the row and column that is old with new data
2011-03-27T01:13:11  <Stocha> i'm totally lost :p
2011-03-27T01:13:29  <spacebat> so are the ants
2011-03-27T01:13:34  <sigh> :)
2011-03-27T01:14:08  <sigh> don't worry half this conversation is just exploring what is possible, rather than what is practical :P
2011-03-27T01:14:11  <Stocha>  But i least i understood that we are trying to incrementaly update the mindistance to ant matrix, as ants moves.
2011-03-27T01:14:38  <Stocha> wich is a good start i think.
2011-03-27T01:14:53  <Stocha> i even could use a matrix of this sort at some point, who knows.
2011-03-27T01:16:09  <Stocha> the easy way would be to recalculate the whole thing every turn of course. from scratch
2011-03-27T01:16:27  <Stocha> i don't even know how long that takes.
2011-03-27T01:16:51  <antimatroid> spacebat: have you read the battle options and proposed scoring method yet? :P
2011-03-27T01:17:02  <antimatroid> that's what i'm most interested in peoples opinion on
2011-03-27T01:17:03  <spacebat> not yet
2011-03-27T01:17:05  <Stocha> so maybe i should understand how to obtain the distance frome closest ant matrix, from scratch in the first place :p
2011-03-27T01:18:08  <Stocha> i could go with : for each ant X
2011-03-27T01:18:29  <Stocha> calculate the whole distance matrix for that ant
2011-03-27T01:18:41  <Stocha> apply the min of all matrix for each squares
2011-03-27T01:19:10  <Stocha> maybe i'll think about it.
2011-03-27T01:19:44  <Stocha> when will the forum be up ?
2011-03-27T01:19:56  <antimatroid> who reads the forums? :P
2011-03-27T01:20:23  <spacebat> perhaps anyone who reads the forums should be disqualified from the competition
2011-03-27T01:21:33  <Stocha> i do. Although i read them incrementally. Wich is easy to do when noone is ever posting anything :p
2011-03-27T01:21:49  <Stocha> why would that be spacebat ?

2011-03-27T01:22:37  <Stocha> ?
2011-03-27T01:22:49  <spacebat> its a joke
2011-03-27T01:22:49  <Stocha> giggles is like laughing right ?
2011-03-27T01:22:56  <spacebat> it is
2011-03-27T01:22:57  <Stocha> but what does that expression stands for
2011-03-27T01:23:15  <Stocha> it means that disqualifying the forum readers was a joke ?
2011-03-27T01:23:25  <antimatroid> giggling - little school girls in a group giggling
2011-03-27T01:23:34  <Stocha> yeah i though it was that
2011-03-27T01:23:45  <Stocha> so it's a kind of laughing.
2011-03-27T01:23:57  <antimatroid> shits and giggles is a common english expression for taking the piss kind of
2011-03-27T01:24:12  <Stocha> taking the piss ??
2011-03-27T01:24:13  <spacebat> antimatroid: I prefer the damage option
2011-03-27T01:24:16  <Stocha> what's that.
2011-03-27T01:24:21  <spacebat> just out of intuition
2011-03-27T01:24:21  <antimatroid> spacebat: correct answer :)
2011-03-27T01:24:38  <Stocha> damage is nice. But there are parameters to choose.
2011-03-27T01:24:45  <antimatroid> there aren't
2011-03-27T01:24:47  <antimatroid> 1 is fine
2011-03-27T01:25:10  <antimatroid> it doesn't make sense to have say 2 ants kill 3 in a single battle
2011-03-27T01:25:19  <Frontier> i dont know what you are talking about, but i like dealing damage to ants in step 1 and checking which and is full off in step 2
2011-03-27T01:25:26  <Frontier> *ant
2011-03-27T01:25:40  <antimatroid> Frontier: Stocha wants to vary the amount of damage each ant has to dish out
2011-03-27T01:25:45  <Frontier> geez, my spelling adopts to the internet Oo
2011-03-27T01:25:53  <antimatroid> Frontier: also, your vision algo is going to be broken too, sorry :P
2011-03-27T01:26:03  <Stocha> if two ants kill 3 then you have a reason for being carefull about ant positionning. Especially if 3 can kill 2 too
2011-03-27T01:26:32  <antimatroid> but the point of damage is that you get more ants in to get more kills
2011-03-27T01:26:33  <Frontier> antimatroid: my vision algorithm? it is brute force and simple, how can it be broken?
2011-03-27T01:26:51  <antimatroid> adding a counter balance to that would really be complicating things
2011-03-27T01:26:54  <Stocha> i though the point was that you had to plan for ant position.
2011-03-27T01:27:05  <antimatroid> Frontier: you didn't use my vision algorithm? then you're ok
2011-03-27T01:27:08  <antimatroid> my one was broken
2011-03-27T01:27:38  <Frontier> should i include one in my starter bot?
2011-03-27T01:27:48  <antimatroid> i'm referring to your visualiser?
2011-03-27T01:27:50  <spacebat> Stocha: all of the resolutions have implcations for ant placement
2011-03-27T01:27:52  <Stocha> one vision algorithm ?
2011-03-27T01:27:57  <Stocha> i think you should yes
2011-03-27T01:28:02  <Stocha> it's pretty usefull.
2011-03-27T01:28:14  <Frontier> antimatroid: ok, my visualizer is fine.
2011-03-27T01:28:22  <Stocha> otherwise you don't know wich squares are solid ground.
2011-03-27T01:28:30  <Frontier> i mean: I SEE the results, that is a benefit
2011-03-27T01:28:34  <Stocha> wich is kinda embarassing
2011-03-27T01:28:45  <antimatroid> Frontier: http://pastebin.com/gscdvw3u
2011-03-27T01:28:55  <antimatroid> that outlines a case where the function we had in the engine didn't work quite right
2011-03-27T01:28:58  <antimatroid> sigh made that
2011-03-27T01:29:03  <Stocha> i wondered if the engine should not send first seen ground squares also. As it does for water
2011-03-27T01:29:52  <antimatroid> why?
2011-03-27T01:30:03  <antimatroid> people can work out what's unseen for themselves
2011-03-27T01:30:13  <Stocha> why don't you stick with straight forward code into the engine ? until you have it fully tested and used. Then you can make some optimization with an heavy regression test policy (cross checking the result of the well testing simple engine with that of the new)
2011-03-27T01:30:33  <Stocha> Maybe simple bots won't want to do that.
2011-03-27T01:30:58  <spacebat> ants shouldn't know the map, that seems wrong
2011-03-27T01:31:00  <Stocha> The starter bot probably have to provide a mean to at least know what are the solid ground squares :p
2011-03-27T01:31:04  <Frontier> use unit tests as my granny used to say
2011-03-27T01:31:35  <spacebat> Just program, motherfucker! is what my granny used to say
2011-03-27T01:31:41  <Stocha> i'm not a unit tests fanatic; They are usefull. But tricky to build. And trikier to maintain :p
2011-03-27T01:32:17  <Stocha> My granny used to say : You jumped on that biscuit like misery on the poor wolrd.
2011-03-27T01:32:37  <Stocha> nothing to do with programming. She wasn't what you would call a geek or hacker.
2011-03-27T01:32:51  <Stocha> she didn't have an iphone to say the truth.
2011-03-27T01:33:07  <antimatroid> i don't think either of my grandmothers knew/know what the hell programming is let alone a unit test
2011-03-27T01:33:25  <spacebat> they could knit, couldn't they?
2011-03-27T01:33:32  <antimatroid> ha :P
2011-03-27T01:33:36  <Stocha> what's knitting ?
2011-03-27T01:33:39  <antimatroid> touche
2011-03-27T01:33:52  <Stocha> i search google for incremental ways of updating distance matrixes
2011-03-27T01:33:53  <antimatroid> Stocha: programming
2011-03-27T01:34:02  <Stocha> and found nothing. I never find anything on google :'(
2011-03-27T01:34:06  <antimatroid> well actually, it's running a program :P
2011-03-27T01:34:33  <Stocha> except when i query for britney spears.
2011-03-27T01:34:42  <antimatroid> Stocha: it's more fun to solve problems yourself
2011-03-27T01:34:59  <Stocha> sometimes it is. But i 'm growing tired of that
2011-03-27T01:35:19  <CIA-33> aichallenge: sigh epsilon * r62fee81 / ants/util/vision_compare.py : Added 2 more vision methods - http://bit.ly/fWw64M

2011-03-27T01:35:38  <Stocha> although i always have to. Because most of the time i don't understand articles until i'm able to recreate the solution.
2011-03-27T01:36:11  <Stocha> Still you can find nice ideas in existing algorithms. Sometimes.
2011-03-27T01:37:16  <Stocha> when will the forum be up again ?
2011-03-27T01:38:39  <sigh> antimatroid: you too, try running the vision_compare script :P
2011-03-27T01:38:45  <Stocha> My new bot is significantly stronger than the reference one on 90x90 maps. But weaker on 200x200 maps. how is that : /
2011-03-27T01:38:57  <Stocha> I dont get it.
2011-03-27T01:39:14  <Stocha> when i looked at the 200x200 games, the new bot really look stronger.
2011-03-27T01:39:39  <Stocha> but on 200x200 map i got Score inWin for P0 -> 304 Score inWin for P1 -> 464
2011-03-27T01:39:54  <Stocha> with P0 being the new bot (which i believe is the strongest one)
2011-03-27T01:40:34  <Stocha> At least it supports my advocating for a fixed map size for the contest :p
2011-03-27T01:41:14  <Stocha> People will not want to test their bot for every possible map size, not knowing what the setting will be.
2011-03-27T01:42:57  <Stocha> the squaredistance=6 is the standard for fight, with Damage(x=1) being the prefered candidate so far ?
2011-03-27T01:43:58  <Stocha> http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Sz80_Fh02G_ExplorAggr_rad6_x1_00/
2011-03-27T01:44:19  <Stocha> here is a game with those settings.
2011-03-27T01:47:41  <Stocha> I guess i should start diggin a bit into that X=1 thing.
2011-03-27T01:48:01  <Stocha> and that everybody has left the irc channel.
2011-03-27T01:49:38  <Stocha> The two bots are of same strength with those settings.

2011-03-27T02:33:51  <antimatroid> assuming it works without breaking obviously the logic seems right
2011-03-27T02:34:09  <antimatroid> Stocha: it is, but it's easier to get sqrt(5 ) wrong with rounding errors
2011-03-27T02:34:42  <sigh> yup, sqrt(7) is the same too :)
2011-03-27T02:35:33  <Stocha> i was wondering because i made some experimentes with 5 and tryed to update them to 6 ... :p
2011-03-27T02:35:47  <Stocha> because in your specs it used to be 5 and became 6
2011-03-27T02:35:57  <Stocha> so i was a bit puzzled at the result :p
2011-03-27T02:36:06  <sigh> these are the only possible distances up to 100:
2011-03-27T02:36:07  <sigh> [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, 29, 32, 34, 36, 37, 40, 41, 45, 49, 50, 52, 53, 58, 61, 64, 65, 68, 72, 73, 74, 80, 81, 82, 85, 89, 90, 97, 98, 100]
2011-03-27T02:36:47  <Stocha> what's the general formulae then ?  :pp
2011-03-27T02:36:57  <Frontier> Stocha: nice visualizer you have there.
2011-03-27T02:37:17  <Stocha> it's a straight forward int matrix visualizer
2011-03-27T02:37:40  <Stocha> with a litle bit of tweaking for making some value round rather than rect to say the truth (i made it later though)
2011-03-27T02:39:16  <Frontier> we still lack a 'game-in-progress' visualizer, and yours is written in Java which is a good start. so if you want to code something up that everyone will use to test their bot just go ahead.
2011-03-27T02:39:34  <Stocha> The problem at the moment is : it's a java to java engine
2011-03-27T02:39:38  <Stocha> there is no text interfaces.
2011-03-27T02:40:22  <Stocha> i simply convert the serverstate into int[][]
2011-03-27T02:40:30  <Stocha> and show every server state.
2011-03-27T02:40:44  <Stocha> it's far from a "game-in-progress" visualizer
2011-03-27T02:40:55  <sigh> Stocha: there's no simple formula, although there are a lot of complicated ones :)
2011-03-27T02:40:59  <Stocha> you would have to build the funct for game-in-progress --> int matrix
2011-03-27T02:41:27  <Stocha> Then i would provide you with the vizualiser :p
2011-03-27T02:41:37  <Stocha> But i think the visualiser you have is good isn't it ?
2011-03-27T02:41:42  <Frontier> well, there is McLeopold visualizer for the streaming format in the 'viewer' directory. It is JavaScript and could set you up
2011-03-27T02:41:59  <Stocha> aarr; i don't javascript :p
2011-03-27T02:42:13  <Frontier> Stocha: My visualizer cannot display games in progress, only completed games.
2011-03-27T02:42:22  <Stocha> why is that ?
2011-03-27T02:42:40  <Stocha> i mean can't you put in partial games ?
2011-03-27T02:42:45  <Frontier> I volunteered to write the canvas visualizer
2011-03-27T02:43:16  <Stocha> For example : you load the game in progress, and only see it up to the point it was when you loaded it :p
2011-03-27T02:43:40  <Stocha> one would argue it isn't a game in progress visualizer
2011-03-27T02:43:41  <Frontier> and we came up with a format that is about the size of a planetwars replay instead of 1MB+ for the streaming format one would use for game-in-progress visualisation
2011-03-27T02:44:09  <Stocha> what you lack is the possibility to update , with the delta from the point you loaded to the now point.
2011-03-27T02:44:23  <Frontier> For example the whole life of an ant is a single line
2011-03-27T02:44:50  <Stocha> you mean you have to incrementally calc the server state right ?
2011-03-27T02:45:04  <Stocha> if i understand correctly
2011-03-27T02:45:20  <Stocha> so you came up with a compression factor compared to spooling every full server state.
2011-03-27T02:45:40  <Frontier> 1:10 is the compression ratio :p
2011-03-27T02:45:46  <Stocha> (wich is what i do by the way, i just spool the full server  state :p)
2011-03-27T02:46:25  <Stocha> but then once you have the incremental turn by turn representation you can decompress it to a full server state again
2011-03-27T02:46:58  <Frontier> I can... but the file format is written in a fashion that it is only output at the end of a game.
2011-03-27T02:47:03  <Stocha> so when you do real time, you need to append whatever you turn updates you haven't buffered yet
2011-03-27T02:47:10  <Stocha> aaahh
2011-03-27T02:47:15  <Stocha> there is no ouput format then ?
2011-03-27T02:47:35  <Stocha> you mean you can't decode anyserver state until you have the end of the game incrementals ?
2011-03-27T02:47:51  <Stocha> so that would where we should start with i guess :p
2011-03-27T02:47:59  <Frontier> There are two formats. I refer to the one i implemented as the 'storage' format. Then there is McLeopolds 'streaming' format that you or someone else could implement
2011-03-27T02:48:18  <Stocha> You need an incremental format that you can decode sever state out of, without knowing the upcoming deltas :p
2011-03-27T02:48:28  <Frontier> Take a look at the wiki: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-replay-format
2011-03-27T02:48:37  <Stocha> okay; i will
2011-03-27T02:48:56  <Stocha> i'm 'll just setup a litle experiment and then i'll dig into it a bit.
2011-03-27T02:49:26  <Frontier> the 'streaming' format has the data turn by turn and is prefect for live views :)
2011-03-27T02:49:55  <Stocha> i'll have a look at it and tells you my thought about it if i have any.
2011-03-27T02:50:32  <Stocha> but if you visualizer work, it should be used also for streaming, as most as possible.
2011-03-27T02:50:45  <Stocha> with simply a decoding phase in before
2011-03-27T02:51:19  <Stocha> or if we can't, at least reuse as most code the copy/past way :p
2011-03-27T02:51:34  <Frontier> @later tell McLeopold: Remember to add some information about the streaming format to https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-replay-format when you find the time.
2011-03-27T02:51:34  <contestbot> Frontier: Yes master!
2011-03-27T02:51:40  <Stocha> well well, let me dig a bit first
2011-03-27T02:51:58  <Stocha> that's a nice bot you have here.
2011-03-27T02:52:19  <Stocha> @contestbot i feel a litle depressed. Can you help me anyhow ?
2011-03-27T02:52:20  <contestbot> Stocha: I have no idea what you mean.
2011-03-27T02:52:34  <Stocha> it never wants to talk to me :'(
2011-03-27T02:55:08  <Frontier> Stocha: Technically your decoder idea is feasible, but I could imagine that is no less work than to rewrite parts of my visualizer to allow streamed data and implement the 'streaming' format.
2011-03-27T02:55:29  <Frontier> @contestbot why is the sky green?
2011-03-27T02:55:30  <contestbot> Frontier: An error occured while trying to show the previous error.
2011-03-27T02:55:32  <Stocha> oh
2011-03-27T02:57:08  <Stocha> okay .. so i guess it's better not to use the error outputstream when you launch your java thing in the background on linux :p
2011-03-27T02:57:24  <Stocha> well i launched the experiment so let me have a look
2011-03-27T02:57:39  <Frontier> the biggest problem is speed. I managed to reuse my JavaScript for the html canvas, applet and standalone viewer which is cool, but parsing replays is horribly slow: a 60 turns game takes 3.5 seconds :/
2011-03-27T02:58:54  <Frontier> (among the browsers only IE < 8 and Opera will be that slow, other browsers have a faster implementation)
2011-03-27T02:59:45  <Stocha> isn't java script universal ?
2011-03-27T02:59:58  <Frontier> which in turn makes me think that maybe I should do more parsing on the go, instead of precalculating everything ahead of time, which in turn would be a start for work on the 'streaming' format.
2011-03-27T03:00:03  <Stocha> the planetwar viewer was javascript right ?
2011-03-27T03:00:17  <Frontier> it was, but for IE there was an applet version
2011-03-27T03:00:30  <Frontier> (basically the same as the offline showgame.jar)
2011-03-27T03:00:46  <Stocha> i only saw the online viewer
2011-03-27T03:01:12  <Stocha> i guess i should try to see what the incremental format is about a litlle more
2011-03-27T03:01:56  <Frontier> You can look at the 0.stream files, the engine outputs and McLeopold's viewer in the repo. There is no more information atm I fear.
2011-03-27T03:01:59  <Stocha> # food spawns after 1 turn and survives a 0 1 1 201 # starting food disappears after 3 turns a 0 4 0 3
2011-03-27T03:02:02  <Stocha> what's that ? :p
2011-03-27T03:02:19  <Stocha> # food spawns after 1 turn and survives
2011-03-27T03:02:26  <Stocha> a 0 1 1 201
2011-03-27T03:02:33  <Stocha> # starting food disappears after 3 turns
2011-03-27T03:02:37  <Frontier> that is the storage format - it is cool
2011-03-27T03:02:43  <Stocha> a 0 4 0 3
2011-03-27T03:03:23  <Frontier> a <row> <col> <start turn> <conversion to ant turn> <end turn> <commands>
2011-03-27T03:03:34  <Stocha> ah here it is yes
2011-03-27T03:05:38  <Stocha> do you use full server state tracking in your implementation (i mean you decompress it to each frame of server state, and then let the user "choose" the one he sees)
2011-03-27T03:07:11  <Frontier> more or less, yes. I use keyframe animations, so there are no 'states' but smooth transitions from one keyframe to another. Keyframes can be 20 turns apart or just half a turn.
2011-03-27T03:08:36  <Stocha> so you decode the stream directly into graphical representation ?
2011-03-27T03:08:52  <Stocha> (i don't really understand what keyframe animations are ... :p)
2011-03-27T03:09:10  <Stocha> my only knowledge with computer science is about int[]
2011-03-27T03:09:22  <Stocha> when you go to far from those, i'm lost.
2011-03-27T03:09:33  <Frontier> lol, ok.
2011-03-27T03:09:53  <Stocha> so you just decode directly to drawing frames do you ?
2011-03-27T03:10:18  <Frontier> Yes, I take a line from the replay ("a .....") and make up an animation sequence for that. The ant can change its color, grow or shrink etc.
2011-03-27T03:10:24  <Stocha> then you stack them somehow, and the user can choose. Or your decode into an animation with compression of some sort or something
2011-03-27T03:10:36  <Stocha> ah okay.
2011-03-27T03:10:58  <Stocha> then the animation is buffered
2011-03-27T03:11:01  <Frontier> Each ant is still a separate drawing object.
2011-03-27T03:11:09  <Stocha> and you can jump to whatever animation frame you want.
2011-03-27T03:11:15  <Frontier> exactly :)
2011-03-27T03:11:21  <Stocha> but superposing every ant
2011-03-27T03:11:29  <Stocha> by superposing every ant.
2011-03-27T03:11:37  <Frontier> what does superposing mean?
2011-03-27T03:11:41  <Stocha> mm
2011-03-27T03:11:47  <Stocha> i don't know :p
2011-03-27T03:11:52  <Stocha> let me check wikipedia
2011-03-27T03:12:01  <Frontier> im german, help me ^^
2011-03-27T03:12:30  <Stocha> mm the litle girl is waked up
2011-03-27T03:12:34  <Stocha> so i'll have trouble now
2011-03-27T03:12:44  <Stocha> i don't know if superposing is english also
2011-03-27T03:12:53  <Stocha> it certainly is french "Superposer" :p
2011-03-27T03:14:07  <Frontier> does it mean 'to add a new layer over something'?
2011-03-27T03:14:36  <Stocha> yeah that's it :)
2011-03-27T03:14:43  <Frontier> and don't forget the little girl over computer stuff ^^
2011-03-27T03:14:58  <Stocha> she is 1 year and 6 month
2011-03-27T03:15:06  <Stocha> watching closely at the chat windows right now :p
2011-03-27T03:15:31  <Frontier> haha, I have the picture in front of my inner eye
2011-03-27T03:15:34  <Stocha> she grow jealous of the computer even faster than the mother.
2011-03-27T03:16:12  <Stocha> the the magic happens both in a line and s line.
2011-03-27T03:16:18  <Stocha> but mostly into a line.
2011-03-27T03:16:30  <Frontier> Tell the mother you do cool stuff with people from all over the world and that it is a competition.
2011-03-27T03:16:45  <Stocha> she knows that
2011-03-27T03:16:51  <Stocha> she saw my applets and such
2011-03-27T03:17:02  <Frontier> The a lines are the core of it, yes
2011-03-27T03:17:07  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott.Bri@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-27T03:17:16  <Stocha> she also made a few argument of it taking too much time, and she encourages me also.
2011-03-27T03:17:22  <Frontier> Alors, tu es francais?
2011-03-27T03:17:29  <Stocha> ui :)
2011-03-27T03:17:46  <Stocha> sind sie deutch ?
2011-03-27T03:17:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: ping
2011-03-27T03:17:59  <Stocha> ich keine deutch sprechen
2011-03-27T03:18:00  <Frontier> ja
2011-03-27T03:18:05  <Stocha> :p
2011-03-27T03:18:56  <Stocha> how but and modular is the visualizer ?
2011-03-27T03:19:02  <Frontier> McLeopold: I just talked with Stocha about the streaming format
2011-03-27T03:19:16  <Stocha> would it be fun to convert it to a more flexible thing ? (like being able to do the streaming or something)
2011-03-27T03:19:21  <McLeopold> sigh: I'll patch the python starter pack, give me some time to grieve my algo
2011-03-27T03:19:33  <sigh> McLeopold: :)
2011-03-27T03:19:37  <McLeopold> Frontier: what's up?
2011-03-27T03:19:38  <Frontier> Stocha: It is modular in a sense that you can parse a replay without the actual visualizer.
2011-03-27T03:19:49  <McLeopold> sigh: Also, I have a great idea for food spawning
2011-03-27T03:20:10  <Stocha> you can add new frames easilly ?
2011-03-27T03:20:20  <sigh> McLeopold: what is it? and is it symmetric or asymmetric?
2011-03-27T03:20:30  <McLeopold> It's both :)
2011-03-27T03:20:44  <Stocha> like if we have the new frames from the last delta from another javascript function is it easy to concatenate
2011-03-27T03:21:17  <Frontier> McLeopold: I don't have the time to implement the live view of games. So I thought maybe Stocha wants to look at it. What do you think? We would need some specs on the wiki page for that.
2011-03-27T03:21:24  <Stocha> starter pack can be symmetric and asymmetric nowaday ?
2011-03-27T03:21:40  <McLeopold> Frontier: okay, I think scrolling is more important anyway
2011-03-27T03:21:49  <Stocha> i think the incremental replay is good
2011-03-27T03:21:54  <McLeopold> And IE support isn't that important
2011-03-27T03:22:15  <Stocha> we need a way to send it in continuing stream rather that a one shot only
2011-03-27T03:22:16  <Frontier> Stocha: We can append frames.
2011-03-27T03:22:31  <Stocha> so let's say you have your a sequences
2011-03-27T03:22:32  <McLeopold> Stocha: we have the streaming format already
2011-03-27T03:22:37  <Stocha> up to say 148 chars
2011-03-27T03:22:49  <Frontier> McLeopold: I was thinking about a different application especially for local testing and live view.
2011-03-27T03:22:54  <Stocha> you can get the 200 new chars and update the animation with it
2011-03-27T03:23:39  <Stocha> my litle girl do have something to say on the matter also. She try hard to strike at the keyboard :p
2011-03-27T03:23:57  <Frontier> She tries to mime you ;)
2011-03-27T03:24:16  <Stocha> i might have to close the think soon :p
2011-03-27T03:24:39  <Stocha> thing
2011-03-27T03:24:53  <Stocha> frontier : what local application ?
2011-03-27T03:25:44  <Stocha> i mean what application will you use for local testing ?
2011-03-27T03:25:50  <Frontier> What people will need is an application on their computer (local) that can display games as they are played. for that purpose we have a streaming file format, but no application
2011-03-27T03:26:15  <Stocha> okay. But that streaming stuff will have to work over tcp also
2011-03-27T03:26:22  <Stocha> it would be a waste otherwise :p
2011-03-27T03:26:28  <McLeopold> Frontier: I'm hoping to hook playergame.py into a  local html viewer at some point
2011-03-27T03:26:37  <Stocha> people will want to look at ongoing games during the contest
2011-03-27T03:26:45  <McLeopold> maybe launch a temp http server on a port or something
2011-03-27T03:27:04  <McLeopold> Stocha: not for official, that's too much web traffic
2011-03-27T03:27:08  <McLeopold> But on tcp
2011-03-27T03:27:22  <Stocha> you still have to design the stuff to be upddatable as the game is going on
2011-03-27T03:27:33  <Stocha> http do is tcp right ?
2011-03-27T03:27:56  <Frontier> Stocha: the 'streaming' format is well designed for that purpose
2011-03-27T03:28:08  <Frontier> yes, http extends tcp
2011-03-27T03:28:15  <Stocha> you said it's heavy :p
2011-03-27T03:28:42  <Stocha> and also you implyed that your visualiser was not easy to update for the streaming format :p
2011-03-27T03:28:46  <Frontier> it is a lot of data, true
2011-03-27T03:29:04  <Frontier> again you are right ^^
2011-03-27T03:29:24  <Stocha> if you are in local a lot of data won't be a problem. i guess.
2011-03-27T03:29:36  <Stocha> but over tcp it might.
2011-03-27T03:29:40  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.214.85> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-27T03:29:51  <Frontier> McLeopold is the tcp dude, ask him ;)
2011-03-27T03:29:51  <Stocha> especially if a lot of people want to watch at the same game :p
2011-03-27T03:30:38  <Frontier> uh... match making on tcp with maps for 9 players may be difficult
2011-03-27T03:30:39  <Stocha> so i was wondering about updating you visualiser for a format that would send complements to the "a" lines.
2011-03-27T03:31:01  <Stocha> 9 players WILL be difficult non matter what.
2011-03-27T03:31:07  <Stocha> if only for the map size.
2011-03-27T03:31:19  <Frontier> Stocha: noone wants a third replay format
2011-03-27T03:31:28  <Stocha> Most of what i tryed assumed for reasonable map sizes :p
2011-03-27T03:31:37  <Stocha> okay
2011-03-27T03:31:52  <Stocha> so you have to build a visualiser for heavy streaming server state then :p
2011-03-27T03:32:26  <Frontier> but i don't want to.
2011-03-27T03:32:31  <Stocha> let's start from there then
2011-03-27T03:32:36  <Stocha> yeah i understand that
2011-03-27T03:32:50  <Stocha> so someone else will do it. But with the heavy streaming format
2011-03-27T03:33:03  <Stocha> the advantage being that it should be easier to do
2011-03-27T03:33:11  <Frontier> i think so.
2011-03-27T03:33:14  <Stocha> if you don't put in fancy things
2011-03-27T03:33:21  <Stocha> like food animation when appearing :p
2011-03-27T03:33:28  <Stocha> or animated ant death
2011-03-27T03:33:40  <Stocha> Full integer matrix are easy enougth to do.
2011-03-27T03:34:05  <Stocha> So let's see : you go from the streaming format to integer matrix, and then just paint this matrix
2011-03-27T03:34:14  <Stocha> maybe you keep all the integer matrix in memory
2011-03-27T03:34:21  <Stocha> so you can go through them.
2011-03-27T03:34:26  <Frontier> correct
2011-03-27T03:34:37  <Stocha> is it reasonable now ?
2011-03-27T03:34:44  <Stocha> what about 500 turns games ?
2011-03-27T03:35:12  <Stocha> let's say we got 100x100 maps
2011-03-27T03:35:13  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.214.85> has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
2011-03-27T03:35:16  <Frontier> what about them? ~ 3 mb streaming
2011-03-27T03:35:20  <Stocha> and we keep an int per square
2011-03-27T03:35:40  <Frontier> ah you mean the buffers
2011-03-27T03:36:24  <Frontier> it makes 20 MB
2011-03-27T03:36:35  <Stocha> mm i get 100kb
2011-03-27T03:36:43  <Stocha> 100x100= 10 000
2011-03-27T03:36:50  <Stocha> then int =8 b
2011-03-27T03:36:54  <Stocha> that's 80 000 b ?
2011-03-27T03:36:58  <Stocha> =100 kb ?
2011-03-27T03:37:04  <Frontier> * 500 turns
2011-03-27T03:37:09  <Stocha> ah there it goes :)
2011-03-27T03:37:16  <Frontier> int in Java is 4 bytes
2011-03-27T03:37:18  <Stocha> 100 kb per frame then :p
2011-03-27T03:37:53  <Stocha> okay around 50 megabytes at most then
2011-03-27T03:38:00  <Frontier> but you could use byte instead of int
2011-03-27T03:38:16  <Stocha> yeah sure, i' just wanted to have a clue of what size to expect :)
2011-03-27T03:39:42  <Stocha> i probably can hack something quick and dirty in java. But i don't like to do real things
2011-03-27T03:39:53  <Stocha> i mean i do debuger visualizer mostly :p
2011-03-27T03:40:01  <Stocha> so you can debug and see what's going on
2011-03-27T03:40:06  <Stocha> yours has neat stuff
2011-03-27T03:40:10  <Stocha> animation and such
2011-03-27T03:40:49  <Stocha> if i do something it will be like mapping ascii to colored squares.
2011-03-27T03:41:03  <Stocha> but then
2011-03-27T03:41:05  <Frontier> That is just for the looks. Noone really needs that. In the end a simple square will do just as well as long as people can watch their games while they run
2011-03-27T03:41:24  <Stocha> it's called a streaming format
2011-03-27T03:41:36  <Stocha> does that mean that your request the frame you want to paint back to the server ?
2011-03-27T03:41:49  <Stocha> like you ask for "turn 300" frame, and it sends it
2011-03-27T03:42:02  <antimatroid> McLepold: pong
2011-03-27T03:42:22  <Frontier> no there is no communication to the server. you just receive turn 0, turn 1, ...
2011-03-27T03:42:42  <Stocha> so in the end, what one needs is the module for puting in a string (Ascii server state) and ouputing that in a square colored. With each char being mapped to a color
2011-03-27T03:43:06  <Stocha> what i you plug your visualizer once the game is already on its way ?
2011-03-27T03:43:57  <Frontier> I need the 'storage' format which is only output after the game,

2011-03-27T03:44:53  <Stocha> no i was wondering about the "streaming" format
2011-03-27T03:45:08  <Stocha> and that you should be ables to request frames from it
2011-03-27T03:45:21  <McLeopold> Stocha: the viewer that I wrote parses the stream format, if you need an example
2011-03-27T03:45:40  <McLeopold> You get 1 frame at a time, in order
2011-03-27T03:45:41  <Frontier> Stocha: you want to attach to a running game? nice idea
2011-03-27T03:47:00  <Stocha> anyway there is clearly two part for the streaming visualizer
2011-03-27T03:47:17  <Stocha> tranforming the ascii frame into a squaredcolor frame
2011-03-27T03:47:37  <Stocha> and then there is a part of making it so that the ascii frame is there
2011-03-27T03:48:14  <Stocha> wich can be from text file, or from tcp. Can be asked for the full list, or partial list (turn 567-600) for exemple.
2011-03-27T03:48:26  <Stocha> it desn't sound too expensive to make
2011-03-27T03:48:30  <Frontier> Stocha: i have to stop you quickly: only on the first turn you receive an ascii map, the next turns are lines with 'a...' and 'f...' similar to the 'storage' format
2011-03-27T03:48:47  <Stocha> with the streaming ?
2011-03-27T03:48:52  <Stocha> ah good then.
2011-03-27T03:49:02  <Stocha> still you can decode them into ascii frames :p
2011-03-27T03:49:04  <Frontier> yes, and the first turn contains additional data, like player count, map size etc.
2011-03-27T03:49:17  <Frontier> you can, but why take an extra step ;)
2011-03-27T03:49:34  <Stocha> so the module for Ascii frame --> squared color would come first i think
2011-03-27T03:49:41  <Stocha> it's like says two hours work ?
2011-03-27T03:50:09  <Frontier> yes probably
2011-03-27T03:50:13  <Stocha> then the   XXX--> ascii frame will have a wider ranger of people willing to do it no ?
2011-03-27T03:50:48  <Stocha> i have seen plenty of ascii frames already
2011-03-27T03:50:52  <Frontier> hehe, you probably expect too much.
2011-03-27T03:52:04  <Frontier> but McLeopold has the code for that already, you can copy & paste :-)

2011-03-27T03:52:06  <Stocha> what about i do a java application where you can paste an ascii frame and get back a squared colored image
2011-03-27T03:52:17  <Stocha> we will then be able to watch animatroid maps right ? :p
2011-03-27T03:52:32  <Stocha> ah he already have that module ?
2011-03-27T03:52:38  <Frontier> yes, you can look at the maps, but have no running games ^^
2011-03-27T03:52:50  <Stocha> he has a good start then

2011-03-27T03:56:31  <McLeopold> I could change it to start playing before parsing the whole input, which would make streaming easier
2011-03-27T03:56:33  <sigh> janzert: I agree
2011-03-27T03:56:59  <janzert> I don't think anything is going to beat that for almost any actual game

2011-03-27T20:28:51  <Frontier> amstan: In the long run, I guess there will be a Makefile in the root directory that descends into the subdirectories and assembles the website. I'd like to make a start and use DESTDIR as the output folder, defaulting to 'output' in the repository root. Any ideas?
2011-03-27T20:34:30  <amstan> ya
2011-03-27T20:34:49  <Frontier> ya, i have ideas or ya, go ahead? :)
2011-03-27T20:36:26  <Frontier> are there other parts despite the website that need an output directory? because in that case I would put my stuff in /output/website/visualizer/

2011-03-27T20:54:44  <Frontier> I want to be on the safe side and see that when I type make/ant, it actually produces stuff that just works. I am not a fan of release days where the parts don't fit together, like in the infameous role playing game Gothic 3.
