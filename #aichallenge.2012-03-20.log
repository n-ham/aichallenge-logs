2012-03-20T18:43:48  <Zannick> no, but if you'd like to wait more than thirty seconds after asking a question, you might have been pointed at something interesting
2012-03-20T18:44:11  <a1k0n> i was going to say
2012-03-20T18:44:34  <a1k0n> however a channel with this many people being this idle can seem somewhat improbable
2012-03-20T18:44:49  <NoxiaZ^> im still here :)
2012-03-20T18:44:54  <Zannick> oh, ha
2012-03-20T18:45:03  <thestinger> NoxiaZ^: what kind of magic is this? :P
2012-03-20T18:45:15  <NoxiaZ^> The best magic ;)
2012-03-20T18:45:46  <a1k0n> no idea when the next aichallenge.org challenge is, but http://www.pacman-vs-ghosts.net/ may interest you
2012-03-20T18:45:52  <Zannick> someone linked http://www.pacman-vs-ghosts.net/ a few days ago; we don't run it but it may be of interest
2012-03-20T18:46:16  <NoxiaZ^> Ahh oki, ill have a look on that :)
2012-03-20T18:47:02  <thestinger> there's also some MIT+NASA thing that someone linked on the udacity forums
2012-03-20T18:47:04  <thestinger> hm
2012-03-20T18:47:51  <thestinger> oh, looks like it's just for teams of students

2012-03-20T18:57:34  <NoxiaZ^> Could have been fun
