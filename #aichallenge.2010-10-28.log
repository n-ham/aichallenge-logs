2010-10-28T02:56:39  <raedwulf> sticking to 200?
2010-10-28T02:57:03  <raedwulf> because that could be a factor for good bots playing each other
2010-10-28T02:57:37  <antimatroid> it was explicitly asked not to post this kind of stuff on the forums, so don't take it as fact
2010-10-28T02:57:47  <antimatroid> jcameron suggest raising it to 400, others said 200 was fine
2010-10-28T02:58:06  <antimatroid> i think a higher one is necessary, i've seen quite a few games in the last week or two where I think the result would have ended differently given more time

2010-10-28T08:14:41  <antimatroid1> the idea would be to zig zag back and forth across the map

2010-10-28T08:33:10  <antimatroid1> i'm going to throw stuff into a simultaneous game
2010-10-28T08:33:15  <antimatroid1> and make my decisions based off that
2010-10-28T08:33:19  <bhasker_> i just restarted my bot
2010-10-28T08:33:33  <bhasker_> lets see how it does, made a few changes
2010-10-28T08:33:40  <antimatroid1> i already have most of the functions written for a library i'm writing, it's just a matter of making it take the game states etc.
2010-10-28T08:33:58  <bhasker_> what do you mean a simultaneous game
2010-10-28T08:34:03  <antimatroid1> i'm not entirely sure as to what to do when there aren't any saddle points
2010-10-28T08:34:05  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-jysyadvnfytyahdn> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-10-28T08:34:06  <bhasker_> you going to run the two instances
2010-10-28T08:34:08  <bhasker_> one playing as you
2010-10-28T08:34:11  <bhasker_> and one as the enemy
2010-10-28T08:34:14  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-10-28T08:34:16  <bhasker_> ah k
2010-10-28T08:34:23  <antimatroid1> and each will pick moves, then create payoff matrix
2010-10-28T08:34:40  <antimatroid1> i'm creating the matrix with nodes, then i can run each of those instances too before working out the payoff
2010-10-28T08:34:54  <antimatroid1> i'll probably use a tree for each player to pick possible pure strategies too
2010-10-28T08:35:07  <antimatroid1> may even try to set up something that'll try to converge to mixed strategies when it's needed
2010-10-28T08:35:22  <antimatroid1> converge to mixed strategy nash equilibrium**
2010-10-28T08:35:38  <bhasker_> ah k
2010-10-28T08:35:49  <bhasker_> hmm my bot just got owned by testingFromPiter:(
2010-10-28T08:36:21  <antimatroid1> i considered trying to use something like minimax regret, but can't work out how to do it for things other than decision choices and not just get the same result, but have to compute nash equilibria for non-zero sum games
2010-10-28T08:36:55  <antimatroid1> i found a cool paper on markov games before too, but i think it mostly went over my head
2010-10-28T08:37:05  <bhasker_> <--- reading up on nash equilibrium
2010-10-28T08:37:14  <bhasker_> <--- not very mathematically inclined
2010-10-28T08:37:27  <antimatroid1> it's basically just the name attached to fixed points in games
2010-10-28T08:37:44  <antimatroid1> in that, neither player can change their strategy given those of the other players to increase their payoff
2010-10-28T08:38:31  <bhasker_> ah k
2010-10-28T08:39:26  <antimatroid1> unless one can pick good potential moves from both players i don't think it's going to matter how well you do things on the macro scale for this anyway though
2010-10-28T08:39:27  <eburnette> morning
2010-10-28T08:39:54  <antimatroid1> and that is incredibly tricky imo
2010-10-28T08:40:14  <bhasker_> hmm
2010-10-28T08:40:15  <eburnette> I was looking at http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=746301 -- is red's move at turn 19 bad?
2010-10-28T08:40:59  <antimatroid1> hard to say, they were behind
2010-10-28T08:41:41  <bhasker_> i think red made a conservative choice
2010-10-28T08:41:46  <bhasker_> it would have been better not to acquire
2010-10-28T08:41:47  <bhasker_> we were even
2010-10-28T08:41:57  <bhasker_> at 18
2010-10-28T08:42:03  <bhasker_> we are both at 210/16
2010-10-28T08:42:13  <bhasker_> there was no reason to acquire a new neutral with an enemy this close
2010-10-28T08:42:35  <bhasker_> so when he shunted ships away from center
2010-10-28T08:42:43  <bhasker_> i could take a bigger neutral with no threat
2010-10-28T08:43:08  <eburnette> if he hadn't have done that it would have been a draw I guess
2010-10-28T08:43:58  <bhasker_> yes
2010-10-28T08:44:47  <eburnette> it's interesting to note that almost everybody uses the same opening move or two. What do you think of taking the two center 34's as an opening move?

2010-10-28T08:54:35  <Naktibalda> what are you going to do with thousands games?
2010-10-28T08:55:08  <eburnette> benchmark changes to see if they improve or degrade play over many different maps

2010-10-28T08:58:08  <antimatroid1> don't get your hopes up, it's fairly late to allow that
2010-10-28T08:58:14  <antimatroid1> but it was being talked about at some point
2010-10-28T08:58:17  <phreeza> if the sandbox is sound i don't see why not
2010-10-28T08:58:19  <phreeza> true
2010-10-28T08:58:23  <phreeza> next time :)
2010-10-28T08:58:40  <antimatroid1> they were also talking about having people run their own bots like tcp
2010-10-28T08:58:50  <eburnette> I don't like binary submissions, they couldn't check to see if rules are being followed
2010-10-28T08:59:00  <antimatroid1> but you basically have to throw out time limits the moment you do that, and people with "good" connections get an advantage
2010-10-28T08:59:12  <Error323> own bots through tcp is fail with a slow connection

2010-10-28T09:03:36  <antimatroid1> not to mention the fact that i also need to make a move when there are no saddle points

2010-10-28T09:03:48  <eburnette> what's a saddle point
2010-10-28T09:04:12  <antimatroid1> a fixed point for both players
2010-10-28T09:04:17  <bhasker_> i can snipe from multiple
2010-10-28T09:04:23  <antimatroid1> one player is maximising their payoff given current moves, the other minimising theirs
2010-10-28T09:04:45  <bhasker_> locutus bot does weird stuff
2010-10-28T09:04:47  <antimatroid1> each player's objective is to max/min respectively

2010-10-28T09:05:09  <Error323> why is that hard?

2010-10-28T09:05:15  <bhasker_> hmm its the same as single source sniping
2010-10-28T09:05:19  <antimatroid1> i thought everyone'd be doing that?
2010-10-28T09:05:21  <bhasker_> if you have coordinated launches right
2010-10-28T09:05:23  <bhasker_> it will work

2010-10-28T09:08:29  <eburnette> seen any good blogs about the contest?
2010-10-28T09:08:50  <antimatroid1> i saw some "advanced strategy guide" the other day
2010-10-28T09:08:52  <antimatroid1> but it sucked
2010-10-28T09:08:59  <antimatroid1> was on that ai forum "offering prizes"
2010-10-28T09:09:15  <antimatroid1> of like 6 months membership to their website
2010-10-28T09:09:30  <bhasker_> ebur you can see my bot attack from multuple points neatly in this game
2010-10-28T09:09:31  <bhasker_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=747682
2010-10-28T09:09:39  <bhasker_> the top and bottom attacks work independently
2010-10-28T09:09:54  <bhasker_> yes anti ai-gamedev
2010-10-28T09:10:08  <eburnette> this one? http://aigamedev.com/open/tutorials/planetwars-guide/
2010-10-28T09:10:15  <antimatroid1> that's it
2010-10-28T09:10:36  <bhasker_> it wasnt' that bad for someone starting u
2010-10-28T09:10:51  <bhasker_> most people who have a decent bot would know most of  what they are saying
2010-10-28T09:11:02  <antimatroid1> it says "advande strategy guide" :P
2010-10-28T09:11:13  <bhasker_> its reasonably advanced :)
2010-10-28T09:11:28  <antimatroid1> not really :P
2010-10-28T09:11:28  <bhasker_> if you look at the strategy guid on the official website
2010-10-28T09:11:34  <bhasker_> i would say theirs is certainly better ^
2010-10-28T09:11:39  <antimatroid1> there was a great strategy guide last contest
2010-10-28T09:11:53  <antimatroid1> i wasn't measuring it against the official one :P
2010-10-28T09:12:19  <eburnette> bhasker_ wow you pwned that one
2010-10-28T09:12:21  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3944), rsergio(3887), GreenTea(3870), rs5147(3810), dmj111(3795), felixcoto(3758), shangas(3755), protocolocon(3744), Accoun(3728), sin_sun(3727)
2010-10-28T09:12:28  <bhasker_> he made a mistake ebur
2010-10-28T09:12:36  <bhasker_> he didn't take the 5 growth planet
2010-10-28T09:12:40  <bhasker_> with 12 ships on it
2010-10-28T09:12:50  <bhasker_> it would have been different if he had
2010-10-28T09:12:59  <bhasker_> so i was up 4 growth almost instantly
2010-10-28T09:13:08  <bhasker_> 5 or 4 growth not sure
2010-10-28T09:13:27  <bhasker_> once someone has that kind of an advantage its hard to level it on close maps
2010-10-28T09:13:51  <eburnette> yeah I think his taking that 50 planet on the right was a mistake too
2010-10-28T09:14:20  <bhasker_> this http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=747720
2010-10-28T09:14:22  <eburnette> he probably has something that doesn't take planets that are equidistant on first move
2010-10-28T09:14:22  <bhasker_> is nice
2010-10-28T09:14:40  <bhasker_> i do that too

2010-10-28T09:16:56  <eburnette> wouldn't that 55 on the left have been a better target at turn 17?
2010-10-28T09:18:11  <bhasker_> let me check
2010-10-28T09:18:25  <bhasker_> not really
2010-10-28T09:18:34  <bhasker_> it would have put me back by 50 ships
2010-10-28T09:18:36  <bhasker_> almost
2010-10-28T09:18:45  <bhasker_> the payback time for that planet is much higher
2010-10-28T09:18:52  <bhasker_> the planet with 11 ships
2010-10-28T09:18:56  <bhasker_> has a payback time of 3 turns
2010-10-28T09:18:57  <bhasker_> or so
2010-10-28T09:19:03  <bhasker_> the planet with 50 ships
2010-10-28T09:19:08  <bhasker_> has a payback time of almost 11 turns
2010-10-28T09:19:27  <bhasker_> and its further away form the planets from which i was launching
2010-10-28T09:19:35  <bhasker_> so it will take even longer to payback
2010-10-28T09:20:13  <bhasker_> hah i like my neutral sniping code
2010-10-28T09:20:14  <bhasker_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=747775

2010-10-28T09:20:52  <bhasker_> yes that too
2010-10-28T09:21:04  <bhasker_> and this is why http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=747788
2010-10-28T09:21:07  <bhasker_> i don't go for middle planets
2010-10-28T09:21:17  <bhasker_> they are almost always suicide unless you can take it safely
2010-10-28T09:21:21  <bhasker_> with overwhelming force
2010-10-28T09:22:04  <eburnette> ooh those round maps are interesting, it's hard to decide which way to go so I go both ways and lose a lot :)
2010-10-28T09:23:02  <bhasker_> they tend to lead to base swaps too
2010-10-28T09:23:12  <bhasker_> i played a map where my lead force was attacking to the right
2010-10-28T09:23:17  <bhasker_> while his was attacking to left
2010-10-28T09:23:23  <bhasker_> so we were like chasing each other's tail
2010-10-28T09:23:30  <bhasker_> quite a funny game to watch
2010-10-28T09:23:51  <davidd> i have that on map1.txt
2010-10-28T09:24:00  <davidd> that is a wide circular map
2010-10-28T09:25:13  <eburnette> move 34 is nice especially since you knew somehow to send more than the minimum to snipe
2010-10-28T09:25:22  <bhasker_> yes
2010-10-28T09:25:23  <bhasker_> i do that
2010-10-28T09:25:30  <bhasker_> i calculate when launching at neutrals
2010-10-28T09:25:34  <bhasker_> how many more ships can he send
2010-10-28T09:25:43  <bhasker_> before mine land
2010-10-28T09:25:49  <bhasker_> and i send that many
2010-10-28T09:25:53  <bhasker_> instead of bare minimum
2010-10-28T09:26:17  <bhasker_> i basically scan all planets of his which are at same distance or less than the planet i launch from
2010-10-28T09:26:27  <bhasker_> and add that in as a factor to the ships required
2010-10-28T09:26:38  <bhasker_> i calculate their free ships on each of those planets
2010-10-28T09:26:42  <bhasker_> and assume that he will send them
2010-10-28T09:26:51  <bhasker_> sometimes it can backfire though
2010-10-28T09:26:51  <eburnette> I've got something similar but I find it tricky not to overestimate his possible attack
2010-10-28T09:26:55  <bhasker_> yea
2010-10-28T09:27:02  <bhasker_> and sometimes i oversend to planets
2010-10-28T09:27:06  <bhasker_> which are in the corner
2010-10-28T09:27:06  <bhasker_> of the map
2010-10-28T09:27:07  <eburnette> or underestimate
2010-10-28T09:27:20  <bhasker_> and then he never counters
2010-10-28T09:27:25  <bhasker_> and now i have ships stuck in one corner
2010-10-28T09:27:30  <bhasker_> which have nowhere to go
2010-10-28T09:27:45  <eburnette> bhasker_ like that 68 on the right side?

2010-10-28T09:28:38  <eburnette> I mean the bottom right planet
2010-10-28T09:28:58  <bhasker_> oh no thats because i don't move ships to staging
2010-10-28T09:29:02  <bhasker_> if an enemy is closer than my staging
2010-10-28T09:29:14  <bhasker_> i just accumulate ships
2010-10-28T09:29:19  <bhasker_> till an attack can be launched
2010-10-28T09:29:28  <bhasker_> it prevents snipes on edge planets
2010-10-28T09:29:35  <bhasker_> if you keep moving ships to staging
2010-10-28T09:29:45  <bhasker_> its a very easy target

2010-10-28T09:33:57  <bhasker_> my staging is at the planet 139 ships on nit
2010-10-28T09:34:09  <bhasker_> which is almost the same distance as the enemy planet
2010-10-28T09:34:18  <bhasker_> with 80 ships
2010-10-28T09:34:31  <bhasker_> its not exact but the basic idea is it takes me 10 turns say to get to staging
2010-10-28T09:34:33  <bhasker_> and enemy is at 11
2010-10-28T09:34:48  <bhasker_> or if we are even equidistance
2010-10-28T09:34:52  <bhasker_> staging/enemy
2010-10-28T09:34:55  <bhasker_> then i lose
2010-10-28T09:34:59  <bhasker_> cause i launch a turn later
2010-10-28T09:35:07  <bhasker_> so even if i could counter it
2010-10-28T09:35:08  <bhasker_> i would lose
2010-10-28T09:35:51  <bhasker_> and mostly i use a strategy of cover, that is i forward only if the angle between src_planet -> staging ->closeEnemy  > 120
2010-10-28T09:35:58  <eburnette> makes sense
2010-10-28T09:36:12  <bhasker_> so if the angle is <120  i don't forward
2010-10-28T09:36:29  <bhasker_> thats why you will see my bot at times has ships accumulating in more than 1 spot
2010-10-28T09:36:32  <bhasker_> sometimes even 3-4
2010-10-28T09:36:47  <bhasker_> and each of these spots can pretty much support the planets behind them
2010-10-28T09:36:53  <eburnette> I have an angle calc in mine too, works well
2010-10-28T09:38:11  <eburnette> I'm using 135 instead of 120, just trial and error to find the right value I guess
2010-10-28T09:38:29  <cfaftw> bhasker_, your bot is sounding eerily similar to mine, now :)
2010-10-28T09:38:45  <bhasker_> heh

2010-10-28T09:38:57  <antimatroid1> i should do that
2010-10-28T09:39:14  <bhasker_> hmm maybe is hould give 135 a shot
2010-10-28T09:39:18  <bhasker_> oh well

2010-10-28T09:47:53  <eburnette> Is anybody blogging about their progress?

2010-10-28T09:48:13  <phreeza> ?
2010-10-28T09:48:50  <phreeza> eburnette: i was thinking about it but my development has kindof stalled lately
2010-10-28T09:49:47  <cfaftw> bhasker_, have you considered adjusting your possible staging angle based on the target planet risk?
2010-10-28T09:49:59  <bhasker_> hmm nope
2010-10-28T09:50:14  <cfaftw> bhasker_, i currently use an angle to cap neutrals... i've thought about adjusting the angle based on the risk of capping any one neutral
2010-10-28T09:50:29  <bhasker_> not sure what you mean by capping neutrals?
2010-10-28T09:50:34  <bhasker_> oh capture*
2010-10-28T09:50:37  <cfaftw> for example, a neutral that will most likely be sniped, i will accept a larger routing angle
2010-10-28T09:50:38  <cfaftw> haha, eyah
2010-10-28T09:50:41  <cfaftw> yeah*
2010-10-28T09:50:56  <bhasker_> hmm
2010-10-28T09:51:07  <cfaftw> but neutrals that i know i can cap and hold, i would disallow routing
2010-10-28T09:51:17  <cfaftw> the only problem is that i currently have no sane way of evaluating risk
2010-10-28T09:51:18  <cfaftw> -_-

2010-10-28T09:56:12  <bhasker_> hehe yea :-\
2010-10-28T09:56:21  <bhasker_> you have to factor in how many free ships enemy has
2010-10-28T09:56:29  <bhasker_> which is quite hard to get right
2010-10-28T09:56:46  <bhasker_> when you say disallow routing
2010-10-28T09:56:55  <bhasker_> do you route ships to neutral via your planets?
2010-10-28T09:59:13  <bhasker_> lol this one completely screwed up obligatory shampoo's bot
2010-10-28T09:59:17  <bhasker_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=748195
2010-10-28T09:59:20  <bhasker_> check this game out
2010-10-28T09:59:36  <bhasker_> not sure what my bot was thinking
2010-10-28T09:59:41  <bhasker_> but it went after a neutral in his base
2010-10-28T09:59:46  <bhasker_> and actually won it
2010-10-28T09:59:47  <bhasker_> lol
2010-10-28T10:00:03  <cfaftw> bhasker_, i have a method to calculate if a planet is "in line" with two planets
2010-10-28T10:00:13  <bhasker_> oooh
2010-10-28T10:00:20  <bhasker_> yea i thought of doing that
2010-10-28T10:00:21  <cfaftw> "in line" means it is both between them and the angle is less than some amount
2010-10-28T10:00:29  <bhasker_> so you just send 2x ships to first one?
2010-10-28T10:00:36  <bhasker_> rather a+b to first one
2010-10-28T10:00:39  <cfaftw> yes
2010-10-28T10:00:45  <bhasker_> yea i thought of doing that
2010-10-28T10:00:51  <bhasker_> except the way my code is structured
2010-10-28T10:00:57  <bhasker_> it goes through destinations one at a time
2010-10-28T10:00:59  <cfaftw> then when a+b arrive at that planet, that planet can decide what to do
2010-10-28T10:01:14  <bhasker_> so its hard for me to combine launches
2010-10-28T10:01:27  <cfaftw> bhasker_, my code isn't pretty :P
2010-10-28T10:02:09  <bhasker_> neither is mine but i try lol
2010-10-28T10:02:15  <bhasker_> actually i think i might be able to do it
2010-10-28T10:02:31  <bhasker_> except i will have to track if i have launched ships for a neutral in line
2010-10-28T10:02:35  <bhasker_> previously
2010-10-28T10:02:43  <bhasker_> and just send the required ships to that neutral instead
2010-10-28T10:02:45  <cfaftw> although, i don't actually use angle
2010-10-28T10:02:51  <cfaftw> i use distance
2010-10-28T10:02:55  <bhasker_> ah k
2010-10-28T10:03:16  <bhasker_> probably better to use angle though since if the second planet is closer
2010-10-28T10:03:21  <bhasker_> it maybe better to split it
2010-10-28T10:03:24  <bhasker_> a/b
2010-10-28T10:03:33  <bhasker_> unless you always launch to closer first
2010-10-28T10:03:34  <cfaftw> yeah i'm thinking that now
2010-10-28T10:03:53  <cfaftw> i do always launch to closer first
2010-10-28T10:03:59  <bhasker_> ah
2010-10-28T10:04:03  <bhasker_> i don't do that
2010-10-28T10:04:14  <bhasker_> i prioritize my queue by value of the planet

2010-10-28T10:04:21  <bhasker_> and i always go for high value planets
2010-10-28T10:04:25  <bhasker_> even if they are further away
2010-10-28T10:04:32  <bhasker_> i don't order by distance
2010-10-28T10:04:40  <bhasker_> not for attacking enemy or neutrals
2010-10-28T10:04:59  <bhasker_> the problem that happens with that is your bot tends to prefer defending than attacking
2010-10-28T10:05:06  <bhasker_> so on maps where enemy is far away
2010-10-28T10:05:10  <bhasker_> my bot would launch an attack
2010-10-28T10:05:13  <bhasker_> enemy will counter
2010-10-28T10:05:20  <bhasker_> and now my bot will decide it should send all ships back
2010-10-28T10:05:24  <bhasker_> when they get there
2010-10-28T10:05:32  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-28T10:05:33  <bhasker_> instead of taking over enemies base
2010-10-28T10:05:45  <bhasker_> so i got rid of all distance based preference
2010-10-28T10:05:49  <bhasker_> for attacks
2010-10-28T10:05:55  <bhasker_> i rather use payoff points
2010-10-28T10:05:56  <bhasker_> to deicde
2010-10-28T10:06:00  <bhasker_> which neutral to go for
2010-10-28T10:06:10  <bhasker_> and i go for neutrals which have better payoff points
2010-10-28T10:06:11  <bhasker_> first
2010-10-28T10:06:30  <bhasker_> i like my neutral sniping code

2010-10-28T10:06:35  <bhasker_> watch turn 32
2010-10-28T10:06:56  <bhasker_> and 56
2010-10-28T10:06:59  <bhasker_> 57 rather
2010-10-28T10:07:38  <cfaftw> i'm trying to figure out how to use a payoffs now... found a book linked to on wikipedia about computational game theory
2010-10-28T10:08:27  <bhasker_> i have a crude way of doing it
2010-10-28T10:09:06  <bhasker_> 999999999/NumShips/growth + log(2^dist)
2010-10-28T10:09:09  <bhasker_> something like that
2010-10-28T10:09:27  <bhasker_> 999999999/(NumShips/growth + log(2^dist))
2010-10-28T10:09:28  <bhasker_> rather
2010-10-28T10:09:42  <bhasker_> works reasonably well
2010-10-28T10:09:53  <bhasker_> larger values indicate better payoff points
2010-10-28T10:10:11  <bhasker_> i divide because i hate negating values to put in priority queue ^

2010-10-28T10:12:24  <bhasker_> not for deciding planet Value
2010-10-28T10:12:31  <bhasker_> planetValue is a simple metric
2010-10-28T10:12:43  <bhasker_> this payoff point is used to decide which neutrals to prefer at a particular turn
2010-10-28T10:12:45  <bhasker_> mostly
2010-10-28T10:12:49  <bhasker_> not for enemy planets
2010-10-28T10:12:49  <bhasker_> etc
2010-10-28T10:12:53  <bhasker_> and not for ordering the queue
2010-10-28T10:13:08  <bhasker_> i use it to discard neutrals if there are neutrals later in the queue with better payoff points
2010-10-28T10:13:23  <Error323> mmm i'm using knapsack for determining neutrals
2010-10-28T10:13:30  <bhasker_> i use knapsack only at first turn
2010-10-28T10:13:33  <Error323> and growthrate/distance as a metric
2010-10-28T10:13:45  <bhasker_> i was using all that earlier
2010-10-28T10:13:50  <bhasker_> payoff points are a better metric
2010-10-28T10:13:55  <bhasker_> and i compare my payoff against enemies
2010-10-28T10:13:59  <bhasker_> to decide which planets to prefer
2010-10-28T10:14:02  <bhasker_> or ignore
2010-10-28T10:14:17  <bhasker_> so if the enemy has a better payoff point
2010-10-28T10:14:19  <bhasker_> i ignore it
2010-10-28T10:14:23  <bhasker_> unless enemy is attacking it
2010-10-28T10:14:28  <bhasker_> in which case i see if i can snipe
2010-10-28T10:14:37  <Error323> mm
2010-10-28T10:15:13  <Error323> and what is your current rank if i may ask? ie how well does it wrok? :)
2010-10-28T10:15:19  <bhasker_> i actually ignore planets with equal or worse payoff points unless enemy is attacking it

2010-10-28T10:22:49  <bhasker_> not sure your what you mean Error
2010-10-28T10:22:57  <bhasker_> i use a priority queue for all planets
2010-10-28T10:23:00  <bhasker_> i build a single queue
2010-10-28T10:23:03  <bhasker_> and walk through it
2010-10-28T10:23:19  <bhasker_> priority being a simple metric
2010-10-28T10:23:20  <Error323> well since in your payoff formula you include distance
2010-10-28T10:23:29  <bhasker_> ah that comes into play only for neutrals
2010-10-28T10:23:32  <Error323> or is that your average distance?

2010-10-28T10:27:06  <cfaftw> bhasker_, i see what you mean about distances causing your bot to play defensively
2010-10-28T10:27:11  <cfaftw> mine is pretty defensive
2010-10-28T10:27:15  <bhasker_> yea
2010-10-28T10:27:19  <bhasker_> so i took all that out
2010-10-28T10:27:26  <bhasker_> with distances used to order planets
2010-10-28T10:27:29  <bhasker_> you will always defend
2010-10-28T10:27:31  <bhasker_> before attack
2010-10-28T10:27:42  <bhasker_> which is not always the best

2010-10-28T10:29:34  <bhasker_> yup
2010-10-28T10:29:42  <bhasker_> also i think your routing code needs a fixt
2010-10-28T10:29:44  <cfaftw> (probably would have lost, anyway, because he capped that other 5 planet)
2010-10-28T10:29:50  <bhasker_> the corner 2 growth planet
2010-10-28T10:29:56  <bhasker_> is routing via  the bottom planet

2010-10-28T10:31:56  <cfaftw> i'll look into it later

2010-10-28T10:32:45  <cfaftw> which bottom planet
2010-10-28T10:35:57  <bhasker_> the bottom top
2010-10-28T10:36:00  <bhasker_> with 2 growth
2010-10-28T10:36:14  <bhasker_> it should just route to the big one in center
2010-10-28T10:36:18  <bhasker_> why route down and then up
2010-10-28T10:36:41  <bhasker_> same for the corner ones
2010-10-28T10:36:49  <bhasker_> they are routing to the planet one below the middle
2010-10-28T10:36:56  <bhasker_> more efficient to route to the middle straight?

2010-10-28T11:54:30  <mega1> AI has mostly become machine learning and symbolic computation is less relevant.
2010-10-28T11:55:10  <mega1> What's good about Lisp is rapid development and speedy execution.

2010-10-28T12:23:12  <mega1> cfaftw: Lisp development happens in a long running lisp process that's rarely restarted
2010-10-28T12:23:41  <mega1> once I load the program I'm tinkering with I usually just recompile functions, files.
2010-10-28T12:24:00  <mega1> evaluate bits here and there to test
2010-10-28T12:24:26  <cfaftw> in python you have the interactive console, and you can certainly redefine classes, methods, and reimport modules
2010-10-28T12:24:43  <mega1> that I know
2010-10-28T12:24:44  <cfaftw> might not be as fluid as the LISP shell you're using, though
2010-10-28T12:24:58  <cfaftw> i definitely don't do my work in the python interactive shell :)
2010-10-28T12:25:01  <mega1> it's an emacs mode (SLIME)
2010-10-28T12:25:14  <mega1> it's more like an ide
2010-10-28T12:25:35  <cfaftw> oh nice
2010-10-28T12:27:12  <cfaftw> how long have you been programming with lisp?
2010-10-28T12:28:09  <mega1> 8 years
2010-10-28T12:28:35  <cfaftw> haha, that's a long time... is it your favorite language?
2010-10-28T12:29:00  <mega1> by a margin
2010-10-28T12:29:19  <cfaftw> what's the runner up?

2010-10-28T12:30:34  <cfaftw> i've only used lisp briefly for one class at uni; a data structures class
2010-10-28T12:30:45  <cfaftw> also used ocaml in another semester
2010-10-28T12:30:49  <mega1> the rest are so far down the ladder I cannot even answer
2010-10-28T12:31:22  <mega1> I had lisp classes at uni too, it just didn't make any sense at all.
2010-10-28T12:31:23  <cfaftw> mega1, oh... i thought you meant by a small margin
2010-10-28T12:31:34  <mega1> no :-)

2010-10-28T12:31:47  <cfaftw> so what got you hooked?
2010-10-28T12:32:14  <mega1> mostly that it doesn't get in my way as much as other languages
2010-10-28T12:32:14  <raedwulf> mega1: im learning haskell
2010-10-28T12:32:33  <raedwulf> and i learnt scheme in my first year
2010-10-28T12:32:47  <cfaftw> i liked using ocaml better, but i think that was solely because i thought the syntax was prettier
2010-10-28T12:32:56  <mega1> after getting hooked I learnt to value the interactive development environment, the object system, etc.
2010-10-28T12:33:04  <raedwulf> lisp definitely has kickass compilers though
2010-10-28T12:33:51  <raedwulf> im unfortunately not of the church of emacs, but use vim :P
2010-10-28T12:33:58  <mega1> being an sbcl dev I tend to agree (-;
2010-10-28T12:33:59  <raedwulf> and quite familiar with gdb
2010-10-28T12:34:07  <raedwulf> mega1: ^^
2010-10-28T12:34:54  <mega1> syntax is what puts people off
2010-10-28T12:35:10  <raedwulf> so C programming is almost second nature to me, i don't miss OO features that much; but i had a placement for a year with C#
2010-10-28T12:35:18  <raedwulf> i quite liked scheme
2010-10-28T12:35:32  <raedwulf> im told its very close to lisp
2010-10-28T12:35:43  <mega1> I'm lazy too, so when confronted by something new I look for a reason to discard it.
2010-10-28T12:36:10  <mega1> Syntax happens to be this reason for a lot of people without realizing why it is so.
2010-10-28T12:36:18  <lavalamp_> raedwulf: you really should check out go, it is similar to C in a lot of ways...
2010-10-28T12:36:22  <mega1> yes, scheme is _a_ lisp
2010-10-28T12:36:31  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: i've had a look, it looks nice
2010-10-28T12:36:44  <raedwulf> but of course, C definitely is a bit more production ready atm ^^
2010-10-28T12:36:58  <lavalamp_> unfortunately, yeah
2010-10-28T12:36:59  <antimatroid1> i just realised, you can potentially tempt the other bot into mistakenly sending the wrong amount to a neutral near them
2010-10-28T12:37:13  <antimatroid1> if you don't send enough to take the neutral, they might send to get there the same time you do seeing it as cheaper
2010-10-28T12:37:14  <raedwulf> did a bit of vala programming too, thats quite nice, but it has some flaws (which may be fixed now)
2010-10-28T12:37:23  <antimatroid1> but not account properly for your fleets arriving at the same time
2010-10-28T12:37:40  <raedwulf> antimatroid1: but isn't this exploiting flaws in other bots
2010-10-28T12:37:53  <antimatroid1> that's part of the contest :P
2010-10-28T12:38:01  <raedwulf> not actually beating a more optimal opponent?
2010-10-28T12:38:18  <raedwulf> hmmm ok
2010-10-28T12:38:24  <raedwulf> i tend to disagree
2010-10-28T12:38:30  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't be surprised if some of the better bots got fooled by that
2010-10-28T12:38:39  <antimatroid1> mine certainly would i think
2010-10-28T12:38:39  <raedwulf> im getting close, i've got two function stubs i need to fill
2010-10-28T12:38:42  <raedwulf> xD
2010-10-28T12:38:50  <lavalamp_> but how do you gain from that?
2010-10-28T12:38:58  <antimatroid1> they waste ships
2010-10-28T12:39:10  <lavalamp_> so do you though
2010-10-28T12:39:15  <antimatroid1> you could send 3 ships and potentially fool them if you did it strategically enough

2010-10-28T12:39:45  <lavalamp_> oh I see you're counting on them not doing 3 way battles correctly
2010-10-28T12:40:01  <antimatroid1> no, they can do that alright
2010-10-28T12:40:02  <cfaftw> lavalamp_ really loves go :P
2010-10-28T12:40:18  <lavalamp_> yup ^^
2010-10-28T12:40:24  <antimatroid1> but if you do future states, they are going to have the incoming fleet arrive and update the ships yeah?
2010-10-28T12:40:31  <antimatroid1> then see it as cheaper than what it really is
2010-10-28T12:40:38  <antimatroid1> or maybe that counts as not doing it right
2010-10-28T12:40:46  <antimatroid1> at which point, i'm currently not doing it right
2010-10-28T12:40:47  <lavalamp_> yeah that counts as a math fail ^^
2010-10-28T12:41:07  <lavalamp_> I don't think that will fool my bot.
2010-10-28T12:41:31  <lavalamp_> Of course my bot already wastes ships on bad neutral planets without even taking them, so it's not even necessary
2010-10-28T12:41:42  <antimatroid1> cfaftw: what about you? do you think you'd account for that properly?
2010-10-28T12:42:09  <antimatroid1> i may decide to not take a neutral after sending some ships there
2010-10-28T12:42:12  <antimatroid1> but it's not really a waste
2010-10-28T12:42:21  <antimatroid1> when i made them they were expected to be the best move
2010-10-28T12:42:35  <lavalamp_> that's how it happens to my bot, too...
2010-10-28T12:43:00  <lavalamp_> but it's really terrible, it's like burning money...

2010-10-28T12:43:22  <cfaftw> antimatroid1, my bot looks at future costs before selecting a planet... so it wouldn't see it as cheaper until the fleet you sent is at least 1 closer to that neutral than one of my planets

2010-10-28T13:33:34  <cfaftw> reading through it trying to grasp game theory... it's a pretty intense book, a good amount is over my head
2010-10-28T13:35:53  <bhasker> so i screwed up my bot royally
2010-10-28T13:35:59  <bhasker> need to roll back all kinds of changes
2010-10-28T13:36:23  <bhasker> so cfaft question
2010-10-28T13:36:35  <bhasker> do you think its a wise idea to recompute available ships after every launch

2010-10-28T13:37:08  <cfaftw> available ships for you or the enemy?
2010-10-28T13:37:15  <bhasker> for both
2010-10-28T13:37:28  <bhasker> since everytime i launch
2010-10-28T13:37:34  <bhasker> enemy's available ships changes too
2010-10-28T13:38:02  <cfaftw> bhasker, you know, i hadn't considered recomputing them... that could be a good idea
2010-10-28T13:38:11  <bhasker> yea i am trying it out
2010-10-28T13:38:15  <bhasker> its just that its taking too long
2010-10-28T13:38:20  <bhasker> i need to optimize it
2010-10-28T13:38:28  *** Sarin <Sarin!~hallo@p5B0EEC89.dip.t-dialin.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-10-28T13:38:32  <bhasker> though i am not doing it after every launch right now
2010-10-28T13:38:38  <bhasker> more like after i handle each target planet
2010-10-28T13:38:52  <bhasker> cause doing it after each launch can make me have to cancel launches
2010-10-28T13:39:02  <bhasker> and then recompute with the orders cancelled and rolled back
2010-10-28T13:39:05  <bhasker> which may be ideal
2010-10-28T13:39:08  <bhasker> but i am thinking
2010-10-28T13:39:26  <bhasker> i think computing at start of turn and keeping it static through the launch sequence is not a good idea
2010-10-28T13:40:32  <cfaftw> mine is static now, but you're right... once one planet launches ships, the available ships on other planets are affected
2010-10-28T13:40:45  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-28T13:40:55  <lavalamp_> hm I don't pay attention to their availible ships
2010-10-28T13:40:58  <cfaftw> yes! another layer of complication!
2010-10-28T13:41:13  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-28T13:41:20  <bhasker> time to bring the python profiler out
2010-10-28T13:41:25  <bhasker> my turn time shot up
2010-10-28T13:41:34  <bhasker> as i started recomputing per planet
2010-10-28T13:42:48  <cfaftw> there's probably an efficient way to redistribute the available ships without doing the whole calculation all over again
2010-10-28T13:43:12  <cfaftw> if you know what planets are dependent on the planet that launched ships
2010-10-28T13:43:32  <bhasker> true
2010-10-28T13:43:52  <bhasker> basically having to do after every launch will require me to update my state map
2010-10-28T13:43:55  <bhasker> recalculate
2010-10-28T13:43:58  <bhasker> then try and launch
2010-10-28T13:44:01  <bhasker> if i don't have ships
2010-10-28T13:44:04  <bhasker> all that has to be undone
2010-10-28T13:44:06  <bhasker> undo state
2010-10-28T13:44:12  <bhasker> recalculate ships
2010-10-28T13:44:16  <bhasker> rinse repeat
2010-10-28T13:44:26  <lavalamp_> my history object keeps track of availible ships along with arrivials and departures; to do it, with orders, I give it a list of "held" ships, ships that the order depends on

2010-10-28T13:48:47  <McLeopold> number of games to play on tcp?
2010-10-28T13:48:51  <McLeopold> ok
2010-10-28T13:49:19  <McLeopold> on the combat tab, my map dropdown is pulling from the wrong folder
2010-10-28T13:49:24  <lavalamp_> yeah although there might be a bug, once it stopped I couldn't get it started again, probably need to restart the program
2010-10-28T13:49:34  <lavalamp_> yeah mine does that too
2010-10-28T13:50:38  <McLeopold> is there a way to set the map folder?
2010-10-28T13:51:39  <lavalamp_> I think it's just buggy... if you type in a folder sometimes it remembers it
2010-10-28T13:51:54  <cfaftw> you can type a path in the box
2010-10-28T13:51:55  <cfaftw> press enter
2010-10-28T13:52:00  <McLeopold> ah
2010-10-28T13:52:29  <McLeopold> I'm trying combat, but I'm sure my bot is broken.  Will it display who timed out?

2010-10-28T13:54:51  <cfaftw> wow this tool does rock
2010-10-28T13:54:58  <bhasker> can someone link what this tool does?
2010-10-28T13:55:08  <cfaftw> let's you play bots locally or on the TCP
2010-10-28T13:55:14  <McLeopold> I can't get it to rock yet.  Just sissor...
2010-10-28T13:55:16  <cfaftw> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=751
2010-10-28T13:55:50  <McLeopold> it looks like my bot needs to be a full command "python MyBot.py"
2010-10-28T13:55:55  <cfaftw> it does
2010-10-28T13:55:57  <cfaftw> full path, too
2010-10-28T13:56:03  <lavalamp_> yeah
2010-10-28T13:56:09  <cfaftw> well... full path to the script
2010-10-28T13:56:37  <lavalamp_> the bot setup is a little annoying because my bot takes half a dozen args depending on what I'm doing... :/
2010-10-28T13:56:50  <McLeopold> I got ragebot working...
2010-10-28T13:57:21  <bhasker> lamo loss to bockismacko by 8 ships

2010-10-28T13:57:40  <cfaftw> thanks for bringing this to my attention
2010-10-28T13:57:45  <cfaftw> i should read the forums -_-
2010-10-28T14:00:40  <bhasker> lavalamp looks like we have a match
2010-10-28T14:01:27  <lavalamp_> am I choosing crappy neutrals?
2010-10-28T14:01:42  <cfaftw> it would be great if this tool could automatically run matches over a range of maps and report the total win/loss percentage
2010-10-28T14:02:01  <bhasker> let me see
2010-10-28T14:02:08  <lavalamp_> I think there's another one on the forum somewhere that will do that... or maybe it's just a script
2010-10-28T14:02:42  <JamesMG> it's a C# app
2010-10-28T14:03:02  <JamesMG> runs yours against other bots of yours and/or the sample bots on whatever map or all maps

2010-10-28T14:04:52  <JamesMG> nah, it's visualization is kinda crappy
2010-10-28T14:04:57  <McLeopold> cfaftw: do you run python?  I can't get it to work with BM2000
2010-10-28T14:05:04  <cfaftw> yeah, python
2010-10-28T14:05:09  <cfaftw> and i'm in windows
2010-10-28T14:05:14  <McLeopold> me too
2010-10-28T14:05:23  <McLeopold> arg!
2010-10-28T14:05:28  <cfaftw> python is in my path env
2010-10-28T14:05:36  <McLeopold> same here
2010-10-28T14:05:48  <McLeopold> the command runs on the command line, but BM2000 doesn't run it
2010-10-28T14:06:02  <cfaftw> so i just have it do:   python "c:\dir1\dir2\bot.py"
2010-10-28T14:07:07  <McLeopold> first turn crash, my log files aren't even being produced
2010-10-28T14:07:24  <cfaftw> syntax error somewhere?
2010-10-28T14:07:44  <McLeopold> no, the bot runs outside of the tool just fine
2010-10-28T14:07:54  <Zannick> do dir1 and dir2 have spaces in them?
2010-10-28T14:07:55  <cfaftw> did you put the path in quotes?
2010-10-28T14:09:09  <lavalamp_> ah looks like my bot played its 500 games and is done for the day
2010-10-28T14:09:31  <JamesMG> you do you have it wait between games or does it just do em back to back?
2010-10-28T14:11:24  <lavalamp_> it just does 'em back to back
2010-10-28T14:11:28  <McLeopold> Hmm... close and open and it works.

2010-10-28T14:14:32  <cfaftw> man this is depressing
2010-10-28T14:14:46  <cfaftw> my current devel bot is generally worse than my official bot
2010-10-28T14:14:50  <Zannick> er, s/write/run/
2010-10-28T14:15:12  <cfaftw> not by a lot... but marginally
2010-10-28T14:15:16  <McLeopold> Okay, just played a tcp game with it... and lost.
2010-10-28T14:15:24  <McLeopold> Now, how do the replays work?
2010-10-28T14:16:21  <lavalamp_> I thought my bot was worse than my old bot because it only beats it 30% of the time... but running it on tcp I see that it does better against other bots...
2010-10-28T14:16:33  <McLeopold> ah, I see a file called tcpGame0
2010-10-28T14:16:38  <lavalamp_> Haven't used the replay feature

2010-10-28T14:18:45  <McLeopold> yep
2010-10-28T14:19:26  <McLeopold> pretty pathetic, huh
2010-10-28T14:19:38  <lavalamp_> that... wasn't the best neutral choice
2010-10-28T14:19:50  <McLeopold> I think I broke something...
2010-10-28T14:20:24  <Zannick> yeah, you let him take those central planets without much fight
2010-10-28T14:20:48  <lavalamp_> you might think about changing the name each time you try a new bot on tcp, so it doesn't carry over the old rating
2010-10-28T14:21:13  <McLeopold> I'm not interested in ratings

2010-10-28T15:35:32  <Zannick> so wait, did the bots not exit or did the engine not exit?
2010-10-28T15:36:15  <Zannick> if the latter, ctrl_c is probably fine, just add sys.exit(0) after main in war2
2010-10-28T15:36:24  <Zannick> at the end of main, i mean
2010-10-28T15:36:24  <McLeopold> the bot crashes, when I end task it, the engine then prints "end monitor"
2010-10-28T15:36:30  <Zannick> oh
2010-10-28T15:36:50  <McLeopold> so the bot is just not getting the signal to terminate
2010-10-28T15:39:33  <cfaftw> mcleopold, are you still trying to get bot manager 2000 to work?
2010-10-28T15:39:51  <McLeopold> I did get it to work
2010-10-28T15:39:57  <McLeopold> except for human mode
2010-10-28T15:40:20  <cfaftw> oh wow didn't even notice human mode
2010-10-28T15:42:12  <cfaftw> not sure what it's supposed to do... can't get it to do anything
2010-10-28T15:42:13  <Zannick> i think the signal wasn't sent because it didn't reach sadbox.kill()
2010-10-28T15:42:14  <cfaftw> no start button
2010-10-28T15:42:27  <cfaftw> oh there is
2010-10-28T15:42:30  <cfaftw> my window wasn't big enough
2010-10-28T15:42:35  <Zannick> that function would have set is_alive to false, which would have then caused "end monitor" to be printed
2010-10-28T15:42:55  <McLeopold> just got beat by rage bot in human mode. :D

2010-10-28T16:42:18  <Todd200> tcp wont work
2010-10-28T16:42:34  <Zannick> you have to make the python script an executable
2010-10-28T16:42:47  <Todd200> ?
2010-10-28T16:42:55  <Todd200> it says waiting for connection
2010-10-28T16:43:04  <Zannick> chmod +x MyBot.py and add a line to the top of the file #!<full path to your python>
2010-10-28T16:43:19  <Zannick> maybe you're not connecting to the server, then
2010-10-28T16:43:25  <Todd200> with that stop "connection reset by peer"
2010-10-28T16:43:28  <Todd200> will
2010-10-28T16:43:41  <Zannick> what is the server listed in tcp.c?
2010-10-28T16:43:47  <Todd200> tcp.exe 213.3.30.106 995 Alberto -p password C:\Python22\python.exe MyBot.py
2010-10-28T16:44:16  <lavalamp_> that doesn't look like the right ip
2010-10-28T16:44:25  <JamesMG> @tcp
2010-10-28T16:44:26  <contestbot> JamesMG: tcp = (#1) http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/, or (#2) http://72.44.46.68/
2010-10-28T16:44:29  <Todd200> what ip is it?
2010-10-28T16:44:32  <JamesMG> that noe
2010-10-28T16:44:33  <Zannick> also the arguments are bad, yeah.
2010-10-28T16:44:33  <JamesMG> one*
2010-10-28T16:45:11  <Zannick> tcp only likes one-word arguments for your bot
2010-10-28T16:45:24  <boegel> lavalamp_: it's Haskell
2010-10-28T16:45:27  <Todd200> ?
2010-10-28T16:45:28  <Zannick> so you should make a MyBot.bat file that contains 'C:\Python22\python.exe Mybot.py'
2010-10-28T16:45:30  <JamesMG> wrap the execution of your bot in a script or do what Zannick said
2010-10-28T16:45:37  <JamesMG> yeah, that
2010-10-28T16:45:46  <boegel> in fact, I'm not sure the loop is *infinite* (can you ever be?), but it's taking way too long anyways
2010-10-28T16:45:50  <Zannick> the thing i said before is for unix, it probably won't work
2010-10-28T16:45:50  <Todd200> im a noob at thsi
2010-10-28T16:46:14  <Todd200> what should i do
2010-10-28T16:46:17  <Todd200> im using the exe
2010-10-28T16:46:47  <Zannick> right, and so tcp will think that exe is your bot
2010-10-28T16:47:07  <lavalamp_> actually it seems to pass on args for me
2010-10-28T16:47:13  <Todd200> hey its working
2010-10-28T16:47:17  <lavalamp_> that command line should work
2010-10-28T16:47:17  <Zannick> really? then i guess nevermind
2010-10-28T16:47:18  <Todd200> changed the ip
2010-10-28T16:47:43  <JamesMG> must be a newer version, I had to put mine in a bash script that just says "mono bot.exe"
2010-10-28T16:47:52  <Todd200> how do i view it?
2010-10-28T16:48:47  <lavalamp_> go to the link contest bot gave and find yourself on the ratings page after you play a game

2010-10-28T16:54:10  <Bobng> and catch the exception and exit I guess.
2010-10-28T16:54:20  <Zannick> and the pipe is getting eof while you're trying to read the input from it
2010-10-28T16:54:44  <Bobng> not much point in capturing the exception though.
2010-10-28T16:54:55  <Bobng> you have to quit, might as well let the exception terminate it.

2010-10-28T17:34:24  <McLeopold> it looks like contestbot was attempting to take over the channel...

2010-10-28T17:37:28  <JamesMG> it's my theory that it's ingesting all the gameplay visualizations we paste, and will have it's own submission on Nov 27

2010-10-28T18:07:15  <JamesMG> tweaking this code is changing the number of turns it takes me to win against the sample bots by 50-70 turns
2010-10-28T18:07:32  <JamesMG> if I could just get it perfect I think it'd help both my bots a bunch
2010-10-28T18:08:03  <lavalamp_> my heuristic is pretty simple:
2010-10-28T18:08:34  <lavalamp_> 1 calculate value of the planet (growth * turns left after capturing it)
2010-10-28T18:08:59  <lavalamp_> 2 calculate payoff time (ships required / growth)
2010-10-28T18:09:24  <lavalamp_> priority = value / payoff time
2010-10-28T18:09:51  <Zannick> so, growth squared * turns / ships ?
2010-10-28T18:09:57  <lavalamp_> sort planets by priority and try to take them in that order
2010-10-28T18:10:13  <lavalamp_> I'm not saying it makes sense ^^
2010-10-28T18:10:31  <JamesMG> that's basically my midgame neutral prioritization
2010-10-28T18:10:31  <Zannick> oh, that's not an equation

2010-10-28T21:51:14  <nullkuhl> dmj111: honestly am not really experience in game solving/ai, am used to solve classical puzzles with game search trees that are computable or other games where only heuristics is the only possible way of solving it
2010-10-28T21:51:49  <dmj111> Yeah, me either.
2010-10-28T21:53:20  <cfaftw> neither am i... but i realize now that a certain bit of probability and prediction are required to make good moves on neutrals
2010-10-28T21:53:37  <cfaftw> well... have realized for a while, but i haven't been wanting to tackle it
2010-10-28T21:53:57  <dmj111> I see zero sum (an oversimplification, for sure), as "something good for me is equally bad for my opponent."  Galcon fits that bill, I think.
2010-10-28T21:54:40  <dmj111> cfaftw: yes, I think the game tree search assumes to much power for the enemy (knowing my moves), but the game theory approach is , um, harder.

2010-10-28T21:58:41  <dmj111> cfaftw: my neutral selection has lost me several of the stalemate games, so I should do something too..
2010-10-28T21:58:51  <antimatroid> me move selection sucks.

2010-10-28T21:59:52  <cfaftw> by "much smaller problem" i mean that it is a much smaller subset of "solving" the entire match
2010-10-28T22:01:19  <cfaftw> the only way i think of galcon being a zero-sum game, though, is if you consider it a 3 player game and the points are planet growth rates
2010-10-28T22:01:20  <antimatroid> dmj: the person who wrote that code is a troll, cnt and cum aha
2010-10-28T22:01:40  <antimatroid> how is it not zero sum? :P
2010-10-28T22:02:42  <cfaftw> antimatroid, because you can make moves without affecting the other player (strictly speaking)
2010-10-28T22:03:34  <antimatroid> which moves?
2010-10-28T22:03:48  <antimatroid> it needs to affect you to count
2010-10-28T22:03:59  <antimatroid> otherwise it's a move with payoff 0 to each, still zero sum
2010-10-28T22:04:19  <antimatroid> if you redistribute to a better position, that's good for you and bad for them etc.
2010-10-28T22:06:02  <cfaftw> well, according to wikipedia's explanation of zero sum, galcon doesn't seem zero sum
2010-10-28T22:06:24  <cfaftw> i'm don't know that much about game theory, though
2010-10-28T22:06:30  <cfaftw> i*
2010-10-28T22:07:29  * cfaftw goes afk for a second
2010-10-28T22:07:34  <davidjliu_> heh, it seems like while waiting for the official server to take up his server offer, bogusbrainpower is perpetually playing seven bots on TCP
2010-10-28T22:10:59  <antimatroid> what part of the wiki page?

2010-10-28T22:12:36  <dmj111> cfaftw: I think if you consider a "strategy" as the set of all moves you would make over the course of the entire game, given a set of game states, then it looks more zero sum.  If you win by N ships, the opponent loses by N ships.
2010-10-28T22:13:22  <dmj111> Non zero sum, to me, means, that sometimes we both may win, or I may lose, but you don't win by as much as I lose by.
2010-10-28T22:13:30  <dmj111> woo.. too much in that sentence.
2010-10-28T22:13:52  <dmj111> thats wrong anyway, now that I think about it.
2010-10-28T22:14:07  <antimatroid> i'm treating strategies as vectors of moves, then the payoff is a function of expected states
2010-10-28T22:14:21  <antimatroid> it stays zero sum, i'm pretty sure it's fine to do it as such too
2010-10-28T22:15:30  <antimatroid> for the moment i'm going to just use minimax to find ne and pick my favourite, if no saddle points exist i have some other hack in there to pick one

2010-10-28T22:15:48  <antimatroid> i'm considering trying to set up some kind of minimax regret thing
2010-10-28T22:15:49  * cfaftw is back
2010-10-28T22:15:55  <dmj111> i should go back to working on mine...
2010-10-28T22:16:05  <antimatroid> or something that tries to converge to mixed strategy nash equilibrium
2010-10-28T22:16:15  <antimatroid> i am about to ride down to the uni, i'll get working again later
2010-10-28T22:18:12  <cfaftw> well i gotta figure something out
2010-10-28T22:18:18  <antimatroid> if you did minimax regret, i think you want to run iterated strict dominance (no way you'll have time to do the mixed variant) then do it
2010-10-28T22:18:56  <antimatroid> although when we did mixed iterated removal we used fourier motzkin elimination, think simplex would be faster
2010-10-28T22:19:00  <antimatroid> but still have huge doubts
2010-10-28T22:19:11  <antimatroid> and that wasn't for this, just playing around some other time
2010-10-28T22:19:31  <cfaftw> "just playing around", haha
2010-10-28T22:19:56  <antimatroid> anyway, back later
2010-10-28T22:20:01  <cfaftw> c'ya
2010-10-28T22:20:30  <antimatroid> an ai comp on randomly generated large games would be cool
