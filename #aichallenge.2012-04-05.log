2012-04-05T04:42:59  <smiley1983> In asteroids, if you shoot a friendly ship, what should happen to your score? Lose a point? Nothing? Currently you get a point for shooting someone, friend or enemy, but it doesn't quite seem right. :)
2012-04-05T04:44:04  <smiley1983> For that matter, does anyone have opinions about how score should be handled in Asteroids if there are multiple ships per player?
2012-04-05T04:44:32  <smiley1983> Are you aiming to have the last ship alive, to kill the most, to destroy the most asteroids?
2012-04-05T04:50:31  <aerique> i'd say either no point or deduct a point when shooting a friendly ship

2012-04-05T04:52:25  <aerique> my personal preference is just killing the enemy, but others have indicated to be more interested in destroying asteroids (my preference would turn it in yet another straight-forward shooter, so there's something to say against that)
2012-04-05T04:53:27  <aerique> one could also score both (killing / shooting an enemy and destroying asteroids) and see what strategies will emerge to become the top bot
2012-04-05T04:53:54  <aerique> smiley1983: i like the work you've done btw on the server

2012-04-05T05:02:02  <smiley1983> Apart from some bugfixes, I'm thinking that delt0r is right about the need for a speed cap (currently the bots running on tcp limit their own speed voluntarily)

2012-04-05T07:00:06  <smiley1983> the better games are certainly okay to watch, so smarter AI will produce a better ratio of interesting games.
2012-04-05T07:00:31  <smiley1983> Of the recent ones, I think this one is pretty good: http://50.116.32.118:2086/replay.1283
2012-04-05T07:02:15  <antimatroid> yeah looks cool
2012-04-05T07:02:17  <antimatroid> did you write that bot?
2012-04-05T07:02:30  <smiley1983> yes
2012-04-05T07:02:36  <antimatroid> my intentions would be to try and throw some numerical calculus of variations at it
2012-04-05T07:02:44  <antimatroid> but i haven't played around yet
2012-04-05T07:02:55  <antimatroid> it looks like maths will be much more useful though
2012-04-05T07:03:10  <antimatroid> that might be a downside
2012-04-05T07:03:17  <antimatroid> beginners need to be able to compete
2012-04-05T07:03:27  <antimatroid> not necessarily at the top, but not be out of things to do within a week
2012-04-05T07:05:13  <smiley1983> yes, that was my concern - entry bar may be too high
2012-04-05T07:05:21  <smiley1983> risk doesn't have that problem
2012-04-05T07:05:29  <antimatroid> i think risk will be boring to watch
2012-04-05T07:05:33  <smiley1983> but I also see that risk is not as exciting to watch :)
2012-04-05T07:05:35  <antimatroid> especially if like me you haven't played the board game
2012-04-05T07:05:55  <antimatroid> but that's just my opinion :)
2012-04-05T07:06:04  <smiley1983> yes, I just played one tutorial game of warlight and read the wiki for making the engine
2012-04-05T07:06:12  <antimatroid> if i'm the 1% i think it'd be good
2012-04-05T07:06:21  <antimatroid> but if lots of people are like me maybe it's not so good
2012-04-05T07:06:53  <smiley1983> I think the things I like about it relate to its similarity to planet wars
2012-04-05T07:07:08  <antimatroid> planet wars was tough
2012-04-05T07:07:16  <antimatroid> asteroids has the "something new" feature

2012-04-05T07:10:01  <smiley1983> One variation which might make it more accessible to beginners would be to make asteroids non-fatal; they just bounce you around, so flying blindly isn't suicide
2012-04-05T07:10:10  <smiley1983> but you still get benefit from flying intelligently
2012-04-05T07:10:17  <aerique> Did you guys ever read the README of my initial asteroids prototype and specifically the "Turn 0: Ship Config" chapter?
2012-04-05T07:10:52  <aerique> that would add some nice variables to the gameplay I think
2012-04-05T07:11:05  <antimatroid> smiley1983: what if hitting an asteroid split the asteroid (or removed the smallest) and deducted a point from you?
2012-04-05T07:11:16  <antimatroid> then your ship dies if hit by a bullet
2012-04-05T07:11:21  <aerique> https://github.com/aerique/aichallenge/tree/asteroids/asteroids
2012-04-05T07:11:47  <antimatroid> you would need to work out which direction the asteroids move off and speed using simple physics :P
2012-04-05T07:13:01  <smiley1983> aerique: just looked at it again, and indeed, it could add depth. Especially if you could configure your multiple ships differently.
2012-04-05T07:13:20  <smiley1983> antimatroid: that's a great idea, linking asteroid collisions to your score
2012-04-05T07:13:54  <antimatroid> i'm not sure now about what rule i'd use for direction and speed of smaller asteroids moving away
2012-04-05T07:14:00  <antimatroid> i'd alter the speed and direction of the ship too
2012-04-05T07:14:06  <antimatroid> but maybe that's getting too complicated again?
2012-04-05T07:14:12  <smiley1983> you'd have to assign them all a weight
2012-04-05T07:14:19  <smiley1983> mass, rather
2012-04-05T07:14:24  <antimatroid> yep
2012-04-05T07:14:35  <antimatroid> ships could be like 2-3 and asteroids 1-n or whatever
2012-04-05T07:14:37  <antimatroid> not too bad
2012-04-05T07:15:14  <smiley1983> I think it's okay for the physics to be a bit complex
2012-04-05T07:15:45  <smiley1983> there's also the question of how to determine the heading of broken asteroids; currently it's random
2012-04-05T07:16:18  <smiley1983> which is okay with me, but I prefer the idea of everything being deterministic
2012-04-05T07:16:54  <antimatroid> yeah i'm very against random
2012-04-05T07:17:04  <antimatroid> but again if i'm the 1% it's not such an issue
2012-04-05T07:17:13  <antimatroid> but in my experience other top competitors like chrish agreed
2012-04-05T07:17:59  <antimatroid> some more complex formulas are alright if what they are calculating is easily described with words and starter packages implement them
2012-04-05T07:18:03  <antimatroid> i think
2012-04-05T07:19:30  <smiley1983> I was thinking that providing all the physics functions in the starter package would be good, as well as a detailed description of how to connect those function into an accurate simulation

2012-04-05T07:24:52  <antimatroid> i think that would be pretty cool
2012-04-05T07:25:18  <antimatroid> you could make it so asteroids don;t break up but do have varying size/mass
2012-04-05T07:25:49  <antimatroid> the larger the asteroid the slower it's starting speed
2012-04-05T07:26:01  <antimatroid> its*
2012-04-05T07:26:24  <antimatroid> i think the shooting range could be longer too
2012-04-05T07:26:33  <antimatroid> like one screen length maybe?
2012-04-05T07:26:43  <antimatroid> or can't cross the edges?
2012-04-05T07:29:25  <smiley1983> I prefer one screen length

2012-04-05T07:31:24  <antimatroid> too complicated too allow bots to control the bullets?
2012-04-05T07:31:27  <antimatroid> to*
2012-04-05T07:31:29  <antimatroid> hehe :P
2012-04-05T07:32:16  <smiley1983> programmable missiles were discussed - they wouldn't be too hard to implement
2012-04-05T07:32:40  <smiley1983> just ships who can't shoot and are smaller
2012-04-05T07:33:03  <smiley1983> and have different collision consequences :)
2012-04-05T07:34:02  <antimatroid> no acceleration either perhaps?
2012-04-05T07:34:17  <antimatroid> ie you can just control the direction
2012-04-05T07:34:46  <antimatroid> and speed is spaceship speed + something or 1.somethin*ship_speed or something
2012-04-05T07:36:12  <smiley1983> do you mean that you could fire them in any direction, but then they are just bullets?
2012-04-05T07:36:17  <smiley1983> that could be interesting
2012-04-05T07:36:42  <antimatroid> no, you fire them, then you can control their direction but not their speed
2012-04-05T07:36:52  <antimatroid> ie. you can control the speed of your ship with acceleration
2012-04-05T07:37:46  <antimatroid> i'm not sure i understood how you move a ship?
2012-04-05T07:37:59  <antimatroid> you probably pick a direction and amount to shoot and thuster at yeah?
2012-04-05T07:38:05  <antimatroid> and accelerate off in the opposite direction?
2012-04-05T07:41:00  <smiley1983> yes
2012-04-05T07:41:20  <smiley1983> so the missile would have constant thrust?
2012-04-05T07:43:02  <smiley1983> the speed would change when the missile turns

2012-04-05T07:54:00  <antimatroid> yep
2012-04-05T07:54:08  <antimatroid> so changing missiles intended course is costly
2012-04-05T07:54:09  <antimatroid> i like that
2012-04-05T07:54:26  <antimatroid> initial course*
2012-04-05T07:54:34  <antimatroid> intended could be very different i guess
2012-04-05T07:55:01  <antimatroid> i think a missiles life would have to be time dependent then
2012-04-05T07:55:05  <antimatroid> rather than distance

2012-04-05T14:07:00  <antimatroid> question... :P
2012-04-05T14:07:01  <antimatroid> what types of demand functions will give a constant arc elasticity? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand) Solving for the point-price case is a simple ode to get P(Q) = aQ^n
2012-04-05T14:09:06  <rwest> a1k0n: don't you work for google?
2012-04-05T14:09:37  <delt0r> antimatroid: economics beyond "more demand makes prices go up" is pretty much total bs
2012-04-05T14:09:56  <a1k0n> yes, the irony
2012-04-05T14:10:01  <delt0r> i mean you can't in fact measure price elasticity anyway
2012-04-05T14:10:41  <a1k0n> i signed up for adsense because googlers are encouraged to use google products.  i had a great user experience there.

2012-04-05T14:31:51  <antimatroid> just like biologists can't model animals right?
2012-04-05T14:32:02  <delt0r> depends at what level
2012-04-05T14:32:02  <antimatroid> i cbf with this now
2012-04-05T14:32:32  <delt0r> modeling the effects of alchole on the brain is easy(er).
2012-04-05T14:32:41  <delt0r> behavor... much harder
2012-04-05T14:32:58  <delt0r> collective behavior of humans.... harder still
2012-04-05T14:33:41  <delt0r> in fact we can't ... of course you can even make and argument that because we use models to predict behavior that then alters behavior.....
2012-04-05T14:33:48  <antimatroid> modelling the collective behaviour of ai bots might be easier
2012-04-05T14:33:55  <delt0r> much easier
2012-04-05T14:33:57  <antimatroid> which will be more relevant the more they're used for different things
2012-04-05T14:34:11  <antimatroid> but i think it would be silly not to attempt to model humans anyway
2012-04-05T14:34:16  <delt0r> of course we could argue that humans don't really have a I in there
2012-04-05T14:35:01  <antimatroid> that was me attempting to make an argument of future relevance of economic theory which you so clearly dislike :P
2012-04-05T14:35:20  <antimatroid> i am a mathematician, i don't care about application, i find economic theory interesting like i find abstract algebra interesting :P
2012-04-05T14:36:12  <delt0r> I did economics... I am more from the Austrian school... that is their is no real useful model in the pure mathematical sense
2012-04-05T14:36:20  <delt0r> there
2012-04-05T14:36:38  <antimatroid> we will forever argue over economics then
2012-04-05T14:36:58  <antimatroid> imo a model is better than no model
2012-04-05T14:37:11  <delt0r> history is at least on my side. We suck at it... and a single line formula? Please?
2012-04-05T14:37:16  <antimatroid> and mathematics can be as general as you like
2012-04-05T14:37:30  <delt0r> no a miss leading model is worse than no model
