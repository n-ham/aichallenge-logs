2012-04-30T07:40:47  <antimatroid1> make sense?
2012-04-30T07:40:51  <antimatroid1> was obvious in the end
2012-04-30T07:41:05  <mcstar> well, i was expecting some elaborate construction

2012-04-30T07:42:16  <mcstar> antimatroid1: what doesnt make sense to me, is what are the sets, which contain only a finite number of raitonals?
2012-04-30T07:42:40  <antimatroid1> the rational point sets
2012-04-30T07:42:46  <antimatroid1> ie {q} st q is rational
2012-04-30T07:43:12  <mcstar> i dont get it
2012-04-30T07:43:27  <antimatroid1> so your sequence is basically {I, {q_1}, {q_2}, ...} where I is the set of irrational numbers
2012-04-30T07:43:39  <antimatroid1> since the rationals are countable the can be arranged into a sequence like that
2012-04-30T07:43:45  <mcstar> ok, but you dont say explicitely, how do you construct q_i
2012-04-30T07:43:56  <antimatroid1> doesn't matter
2012-04-30T07:44:05  <antimatroid1> it's doable
2012-04-30T07:44:16  <mcstar> ok
2012-04-30T07:44:36  <antimatroid1> there's a bijection from the natural numbers to the rationals
2012-04-30T07:44:40  <antimatroid1> hence why they are countable
2012-04-30T07:44:47  <mcstar> yes
2012-04-30T07:44:51  <antimatroid1> so you would do it with such a bijection
2012-04-30T07:45:11  <antimatroid1> if f:N->Q then q_i = f(i)
2012-04-30T07:45:22  <antimatroid1> where f is a bijection
2012-04-30T07:45:47  <mcstar> but |q_i| must be finite
2012-04-30T07:46:23  <mcstar> so f's domain is only N' \subset N
2012-04-30T07:46:26  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@man-208-66.pks.muni.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2012-04-30T07:46:36  <antimatroid1> no, the measure of each set in the sequence must be finite
2012-04-30T07:46:46  <antimatroid1> meaning each set in the sequence must have a finite number of rational numbers in it
2012-04-30T07:46:55  <antimatroid1> and the union of the sets in the sequence must be R
2012-04-30T07:47:58  <mcstar> but if f is a bijection, then N will be transformed to a set of similar cardinality
2012-04-30T07:48:02  <mcstar> i.e. inf
2012-04-30T07:48:25  <antimatroid1> but each set in the sequence is either I or {q_i}
2012-04-30T07:48:28  <mcstar> and that means each q_i's measure(the number of raionals in it) will be too
2012-04-30T07:48:38  <antimatroid1> and u(I) = 0 and u({q_i}) = 1 for all i \in N
2012-04-30T07:48:56  <antimatroid1> there is only 1 rational number in the set {q_i}
2012-04-30T07:49:14  <mcstar> oh
2012-04-30T07:49:38  <mcstar> antimatroid1: ah ok, so f is bijection between N and ALL the rationals
2012-04-30T07:49:43  <antimatroid1> yeah
2012-04-30T07:50:17  <antimatroid1> such a bijection exists because i've been told so :P
2012-04-30T07:50:24  <antimatroid1> i can't remember how to construct one
2012-04-30T07:51:26  <mcstar> there is a famous construction that does that
2012-04-30T07:51:36  <mcstar> i cant remember after whom it is named
2012-04-30T07:51:46  <antimatroid1> there's the diagonalisation argument to show the reals aren't countable
2012-04-30T07:51:58  <mcstar> and that is from whom?
2012-04-30T07:52:01  <mcstar> euler?
2012-04-30T07:52:16  <mcstar> doest matter
2012-04-30T07:52:44  <mcstar> n
2012-04-30T07:54:35  <antimatroid1> cantor
2012-04-30T07:54:36  <antimatroid1> i think
2012-04-30T07:55:27  <antimatroid1> i really ought to know this stuff better
2012-04-30T07:55:29  <antimatroid1> but i don't :P
2012-04-30T07:55:45  <antimatroid1> i easily get confused once things become infinite
2012-04-30T07:56:17  <antimatroid1> but then some people refer to finite problems as trivial :P
2012-04-30T07:56:32  <delt0r__> antimatroid1: then only consider an infinitely small subset of infinite :D
2012-04-30T07:56:44  <mcstar> there was a prof, he said he can see everything well, up to 7 dimensions, but he gets confused around 8
2012-04-30T07:56:47  <antimatroid1> obviously ignoring computational constraints
2012-04-30T07:56:57  <antimatroid1> that prof is an idiot imo
2012-04-30T07:57:02  <mcstar> ahah
2012-04-30T07:57:05  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-30T07:57:08  <mcstar> it is bs
2012-04-30T07:57:18  <antimatroid1> you can
2012-04-30T07:57:23  <antimatroid1> t "see" in more than 3
2012-04-30T07:57:33  <antimatroid1> you understand the analogous concepts for higher dimensions
2012-04-30T07:57:41  <antimatroid1> but to then get tripped from 7 to 8 is retarded
2012-04-30T07:57:42  <delt0r__> antimatroid1: the mathematics can...
2012-04-30T07:57:46  <mcstar> (i heard it second-hand, but he really said something like that)
2012-04-30T07:58:04  <delt0r__> and if you can understand that... etc... it can be argued to be the same as seeing
2012-04-30T07:58:26  <antimatroid1> delt0r__: yeah I mean you can't visualise something in a 4d graph, only projections of that into 2-3 dimensions
2012-04-30T07:58:47  <antimatroid1> i'm using a stricter notion of seeing
2012-04-30T07:58:51  <delt0r__> well i deal with problems with many more than 3 parameters... and i understand them well...
2012-04-30T07:58:54  <mcstar> i think he meant some higher dimensional geometry where seeing meant seeing, and not algebraic structure manipulation
2012-04-30T07:58:56  <delt0r__> but i can't plot it
2012-04-30T07:58:59  <antimatroid1> yes so do i
2012-04-30T07:59:03  <antimatroid1> that's what i mean though
2012-04-30T07:59:14  <antimatroid1> you can't actually "see" a 4 dimensional surface
2012-04-30T07:59:21  <antimatroid1> you can know a lot about the surface
2012-04-30T07:59:28  <antimatroid1> but you can't see the surface in it's entirely
2012-04-30T07:59:55  <mcstar> entirety
2012-04-30T08:00:10  <antimatroid1> :P
2012-04-30T08:00:40  <mcstar> antimatroid1: ml is dead simple soo far
2012-04-30T08:00:41  <antimatroid1> delt0r__: you'd have to agree that getting tripped from 7 to 8 makes no sense
2012-04-30T08:00:52  <antimatroid1> mcstar: fun?
2012-04-30T08:00:55  <mcstar> no
2012-04-30T08:01:01  <antimatroid1> nawww
2012-04-30T08:01:08  <mcstar> you dont need to think
2012-04-30T08:01:14  <mcstar> not half as good as crypto
2012-04-30T08:01:15  <antimatroid1> my probability and measure classes are pretty cool
2012-04-30T08:01:28  <mcstar> i had to think to solve crypto(and to follow it)
2012-04-30T08:01:33  <antimatroid1> i haven't been to classes for probability since like the second week though, oops
2012-04-30T08:01:41  <delt0r__> antimatroid1: perhaps... but this is exactly the sort of thing these guys usually say
2012-04-30T08:01:58  <delt0r__> of course if i get the job in NZ... i will be one of these guys :
2012-04-30T08:01:59  <delt0r__> :D
2012-04-30T08:02:07  <antimatroid1> he sounds like one of the people who makes those videos on youtube about "visualising n-dimensions"
2012-04-30T08:02:08  <antimatroid1> they're bs
2012-04-30T08:02:20  <antimatroid1> which job?
2012-04-30T08:02:26  <antimatroid1> the commonwealth bank
2012-04-30T08:02:33  <antimatroid1> only australians will get that
2012-04-30T08:02:37  <mcstar> he is going to be a prof again
2012-04-30T08:02:40  <mcstar> right?
2012-04-30T08:02:48  <antimatroid1> nz would be sweet

2012-04-30T08:03:04  <antimatroid1> being paid to do research and teach would be awesome
2012-04-30T08:03:15  <delt0r__> it is what a postdoc is
2012-04-30T08:03:16  <antimatroid1> i am being paid to do that now, but for longer
2012-04-30T08:03:19  <delt0r__> only with less teaching
2012-04-30T08:03:31  <delt0r__> it been 9 years for me now
2012-04-30T08:03:40  <delt0r__> time to get a real job
2012-04-30T08:03:57  <antimatroid1> hehe, i thought we refer to academic jobs as not real?
2012-04-30T08:04:19  <delt0r__> well this is a real job in that there is no finish date on the contract
2012-04-30T08:04:34  <delt0r__> right now i never have a job for longer than a year at a time
2012-04-30T08:04:45  <delt0r__> PITA really
2012-04-30T08:05:07  <antimatroid1> is it near queenstown?

2012-04-30T08:05:50  <delt0r__> have been in vienna for 6 years now
2012-04-30T08:06:46  <delt0r__> but never with a fixed job for that long... only for one more year ... at a time
2012-04-30T08:06:47  <antimatroid1> any idea how many they've narrowed it down to?
2012-04-30T08:06:52  <delt0r__> 3
2012-04-30T08:06:52  <antimatroid1> and when they'll decide etc?
2012-04-30T08:06:56  <antimatroid1> i assume it's for starting next year?
2012-04-30T08:07:13  <antimatroid1> or next semester?
2012-04-30T08:07:14  <delt0r__> i have a interview talk on the 21st may
2012-04-30T08:07:18  <delt0r__> flying me over
2012-04-30T08:07:22  <antimatroid1> nice
2012-04-30T08:07:29  <antimatroid1> do well :)
2012-04-30T08:07:33  <delt0r__> hope so
2012-04-30T08:07:40  <antimatroid1> i feel weird wishing people good luck when i don't believe in luck
2012-04-30T08:07:44  <antimatroid1> but i think you get what i mean :P
2012-04-30T08:07:55  <delt0r__> it not about me being good... it is about the others not fitting as well as me
2012-04-30T08:07:58  <delt0r__> i hope
2012-04-30T08:08:07  <antimatroid1> unfortunately too true
2012-04-30T08:08:42  <delt0r__> we are all good or they wouldn't foot the bill for flights
2012-04-30T08:08:45  <antimatroid1> i have been running an informal "seminar" at uni which has gained me brownie points

2012-04-30T08:09:43  <delt0r__> not really
2012-04-30T08:09:44  <antimatroid1> so it's a bonus if where you get offered a job is somewhere you'd like to live

2012-04-30T08:10:00  <antimatroid1> yeah
2012-04-30T08:10:04  <delt0r__> but i just LOVE it here
2012-04-30T08:10:11  <delt0r__> in EU and vienna in particular
2012-04-30T08:10:20  <antimatroid1> yeah i would like to spend some time in europe
2012-04-30T08:10:45  <antimatroid1> i might save up holiday time and head over at the end of next year or something
2012-04-30T08:10:55  <delt0r__> make an effort... it is worth it and pretty cheap if you want it too be. Consider Couch surfing
2012-04-30T08:11:01  <antimatroid1> my bank account is finally going upwards rather than sitting near 0
2012-04-30T08:11:04  * delt0r__ is CS member 
2012-04-30T08:11:15  <delt0r__> Ironically mine is negative
2012-04-30T08:11:27  <antimatroid1> technically i owe the government $35,000
2012-04-30T08:11:32  <delt0r__> Ha
2012-04-30T08:11:38  <delt0r__> 148k NZD
2012-04-30T08:11:43  <delt0r__> one of the largest in NZ
2012-04-30T08:11:51  <antimatroid1> but it's hecs debt, so don't have to pay anything back till i'm earning like $50k/year and only interest is inflation
2012-04-30T08:12:07  <delt0r__> i have to pay 3k EU per year
2012-04-30T08:12:22  <delt0r__> the new job it will be 8k NDZ
2012-04-30T08:12:25  <delt0r__> NZD
2012-04-30T08:12:35  <delt0r__> both is *below* interest
2012-04-30T08:12:45  <delt0r__> my maturity date is infinity!
2012-04-30T08:12:50  <antimatroid1> i'm currently on 24k/year tax free scholarship and whatever i make taking tutes
2012-04-30T08:13:02  <antimatroid1> but i get like $115 to take a 50 minute economics tute
2012-04-30T08:13:03  <delt0r__> same as in NZ
2012-04-30T08:13:04  <antimatroid1> less for maths

2012-04-30T08:15:49  <mcstar> id guess not

2012-04-30T08:21:17  <antimatroid1> i need to somehow convince someone rich to just pay me a livable wage to do research
2012-04-30T08:21:20  <antimatroid1> that would be my dream job
2012-04-30T08:21:26  <antimatroid1> i could be a travelling mathematician
2012-04-30T08:22:08  <mcstar> like Erdos?
2012-04-30T08:22:13  <antimatroid1> yep
2012-04-30T08:22:22  <mcstar> watch, out, he did amphetamines
2012-04-30T08:22:30  <antimatroid1> yeah i was gonna say, without the speed
2012-04-30T08:22:51  <mcstar> i have yet to read Proofs from the Book
2012-04-30T08:22:59  <antimatroid1> same

2012-04-30T08:30:33  <delt0r__> and if you can't teach it, you don't really understand it

2012-04-30T08:30:43  <delt0r__> no
2012-04-30T08:30:51  <delt0r__> post is about 1000x better
2012-04-30T08:30:54  <delt0r__> more pay
2012-04-30T08:30:56  <antimatroid1> i've actually found what should be my easiest class to teach is the hardest
2012-04-30T08:30:58  <delt0r__> only papers
2012-04-30T08:31:05  <antimatroid1> because the students know almost no mathematics
2012-04-30T08:31:06  <delt0r__> no thesis
2012-04-30T08:31:15  <antimatroid1> so i need to explain it in terms they can understand, which is hard without the maths
2012-04-30T08:31:15  <delt0r__> antimatroid1: yep
2012-04-30T08:31:24  <delt0r__> first year is the worse to teach
2012-04-30T08:31:32  <antimatroid1> they're all first year units
2012-04-30T08:31:36  <antimatroid1> but 2 are better than 1
2012-04-30T08:31:42  <mcstar> pairofdice: i was kidding
2012-04-30T08:31:51  <delt0r__> mostly because they are idiots and only are there because it is a prerequisite
2012-04-30T08:32:30  <antimatroid1> i'm only taking tutes too
2012-04-30T08:32:32  <antimatroid1> not lectures
2012-04-30T08:32:47  <delt0r__> right .. so TA?
2012-04-30T08:32:52  <antimatroid1> yeah pretty much
2012-04-30T08:33:08  <antimatroid1> although i'm the only person the students interact with for one unit, so i have a lot more freedom there
2012-04-30T08:33:18  <antimatroid1> it's via video conference to people in launceston and burnie
2012-04-30T08:33:34  <antimatroid1> so i sort of half teach during those tutes
2012-04-30T08:33:39  <antimatroid1> rather than just working through set problems
2012-04-30T08:33:40  <delt0r__> sounds remote

2012-04-30T11:54:13  <mleise> I just tried a trie and they are fast. in my use case 5* the speed of simple hash lookups :)
2012-04-30T11:54:36  <thestinger> mleise: what kind?
2012-04-30T11:54:44  <thestinger> prefix trie or a nice radix one?
2012-04-30T11:55:09  <thestinger> (gcc has a nice implementation included in libstdc++ btw)
2012-04-30T11:58:03  <mleise> a prefix one
2012-04-30T11:58:34  <mleise> I'm trying to find out if I have registred a handler for whatever my parser stumbles over
2012-04-30T11:59:07  <mleise> so I do an eager matching of the prefix until the trie is out of data. the longest match counts
2012-04-30T12:00:30  <mleise> i don't have much data in it, and no long words, so in this case the O(n) access time for long words doesn't count
2012-04-30T12:01:19  <thestinger> mleise: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree that's the optimized version

2012-04-30T12:16:27  <mleise> i.e. i wanted to use node['a'] instead of node.children['a']
2012-04-30T12:16:35  <mleise> directly?
2012-04-30T12:16:44  <thestinger> by-value
2012-04-30T12:16:55  <mleise> how do you know how deep your tree will be?
2012-04-30T12:17:21  <thestinger> it's all on the heap anyway since the arrays are dynamically allocated in mine
2012-04-30T12:18:01  <thestinger> so the pointer is to an array, rather than an array of pointers
2012-04-30T12:18:18  <thestinger> for some reason it's a lot faster that way (at least in this case)
2012-04-30T12:18:20  <mleise> ah, let me get that straight in my head
2012-04-30T12:19:03  <thestinger> I optimized it for lookups instead of inserts so there are little sorted arrays (up to 256 size at max, like yours)
2012-04-30T12:21:42  <mleise> lol, how can I possibly allocate a new static array in D? I thinks it is dynamic, when I write new
2012-04-30T12:22:19  * thestinger has no idea :P
2012-04-30T12:22:30  <mleise> sorted array? why when you can waste space and have direct array access?
2012-04-30T12:22:47  <thestinger> mleise: because I needed to store millions of things in it :P
2012-04-30T12:23:23  <thestinger> 256 byte overhead per byte of string would be too much
2012-04-30T12:23:42  <thestinger> and you might be surprised by the performance due to CPU cache if you save space
2012-04-30T12:26:11  <mleise> ok, it doesn't work that way, new can only allocate stucts, classes and dynamic arrays
2012-04-30T12:26:27  <thestinger> well a dynamic array is fine
2012-04-30T12:26:30  <thestinger> oh
2012-04-30T12:26:47  <thestinger> you mean you can't store the other structs by-value in a dynamic array?
2012-04-30T12:26:50  <thestinger> hmm
2012-04-30T12:27:31  <mleise> I cannot have struct TrieNode { TrieNode[256]* children; }
2012-04-30T12:27:47  <mleise> and then say node.children = new TrieNode[256];
2012-04-30T12:27:58  <thestinger> ah

2012-04-30T12:28:40  * thestinger doesn't know D
2012-04-30T12:29:01  <thestinger> in C++ I just used std::vector<node> instead of std::vector<node *>
2012-04-30T12:29:12  <thestinger> I'm pretty sure using std::array<node, 256> would explode the stack :P

2012-04-30T12:34:45  <mleise> and the latter is what doesn't work for me
2012-04-30T12:35:40  <mleise> anyway with 7000 samples of two letter words, I am now 10 times faster than the built-in hash. that's good enough. I don't know how much the cache likes it though
2012-04-30T12:36:58  <UncleVasya> or you can try    #pragma comment(linker, "/STACK:%big_number_here%")   This is for Visual Studion, don't know about other compilers.
2012-04-30T12:37:26  <thestinger> UncleVasya: POSIX lets you set the stack size
2012-04-30T12:37:39  <thestinger> iirc it's a bad idea but I forget why
2012-04-30T12:38:03  <thestinger> (to make it huge at least)
2012-04-30T12:38:06  <mcstar> just allocate blocks on the heap
2012-04-30T12:39:47  <mcstar> thestinger: have you tried intel mkl routines?
2012-04-30T12:40:08  <thestinger> nope
2012-04-30T12:40:09  <mleise> i have an idea... i'll try a 3 level stack allocated Trie
2012-04-30T12:40:32  <mcstar> i compiled numpy with the amcl, and inverting a matrix was almost 5 times faster
2012-04-30T12:40:34  <thestinger> mleise: I think using a radix trie will speed up lookups a lot
2012-04-30T12:40:36  <mcstar> than standard vlas/lapack
2012-04-30T12:40:50  <thestinger> at the expense of more insert/deletion time
2012-04-30T12:41:10  <mcstar> vlas->blas
2012-04-30T12:41:31  <mcstar> you have to pay to use mkl sadly
2012-04-30T12:41:39  <mcstar> previously it was free for non commercial use

2012-04-30T12:48:23  <mcstar> why dont you abstact out the coordinates?

2012-04-30T12:51:48  <mcstar> or you could write a little gui
2012-04-30T12:52:11  <thestinger> nooooo never :P
2012-04-30T12:52:19  <thestinger> this makes it easy to feed with input
2012-04-30T12:52:26  <mcstar> ?
2012-04-30T12:52:35  <UncleVasya> and also c++ code of 5027 lines in one file - Gull chess engine (a strong one I suppose).
2012-04-30T12:52:36  <mcstar> i gui can only make it better
2012-04-30T12:52:42  <mcstar> you could still feed it data

2012-04-30T12:55:02  <thestinger> the c++11 class enums are awesome
2012-04-30T12:55:14  <thestinger> can set the type of integer they use, and they're strongly typed

2012-04-30T13:26:25  <mleise> why does my try of 134 MB not use any physical memory?
2012-04-30T13:26:29  <mleise> *trie
2012-04-30T13:27:05  <mleise> I don't get it. It seems modern OSs have *really* good optimizations for zeroed out data blocks
2012-04-30T13:27:20  <thestinger> did you actually zero them out?
2012-04-30T13:27:44  <mleise> no, but they... are zero. i don't have any members that would default to something different
2012-04-30T13:27:56  <thestinger> malloc uses no memory on linux until you actually start using it
2012-04-30T13:28:15  <mleise> well, at the moment it is a global variable
2012-04-30T13:28:28  <mleise> so the compiler puts it into .bss
2012-04-30T13:28:49  <mleise> then linux loads the file and maps that stuff to the magic zero-page, obviously
2012-04-30T13:29:04  <mleise> it must be that way
2012-04-30T13:29:25  <mleise> that's pretty cool. it means i can waste memory like a maniac *g*

2012-04-30T13:54:09  <mcstar> thestinger: so if my pawn hasnt moved yet, and theres an enemy pawn in front of it, it can kill it by moving 2 squares?
2012-04-30T13:54:24  <thestinger> mcstar: no
2012-04-30T13:54:36  <thestinger> if it moves 2 squares, an enemy can kill it as if it had moved 1

2012-04-30T13:55:57  <Zannick> en passant is only possible for one pawn at a time
2012-04-30T13:56:01  <Zannick> in normal chess
2012-04-30T13:56:31  <thestinger> since it has to happen on the turn immediately after

2012-04-30T13:58:55  <thestinger> 50 moves without a piece capture is a draw
2012-04-30T13:59:15  <thestinger> there used to be exceptions allowing it to go on longer for certain positions but they were removed
2012-04-30T13:59:18  <thestinger> weird stuff

2012-04-30T14:32:17  <mcstar> it must be annoying, that you tell the possible reasons, but they seem to ignore them
2012-04-30T14:32:51  <thestinger> yup :P
2012-04-30T14:33:19  <thestinger> I mostly only talk in -offtopic and offtopic in #archlinux
2012-04-30T14:36:52  <mcstar> thestinger: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/306316578/light-table
2012-04-30T14:37:03  <thestinger> heh
2012-04-30T14:37:03  <mcstar> i think they gonna make it
2012-04-30T14:37:50  <mcstar> i wonder if machine learning would be applicable for that ide
2012-04-30T14:37:53  <thestinger> If we hit $300k, Python will be the third language to be supported out of the gate.
2012-04-30T14:37:54  <mcstar> i bet it is
2012-04-30T14:37:57  <thestinger> :0
2012-04-30T14:38:15  <thestinger> The first two languages it will support are Javascript and Clojure, but the application will be written in such a way that adding new languages can happen through plugins.
2012-04-30T14:38:18  <thestinger> javascript :(
2012-04-30T14:38:35  <thestinger> stupid netscape.
2012-04-30T14:38:45  <mcstar> thestinger: you see? even if python wont be supported oob, you can still write a plugin for it for free
2012-04-30T14:39:12  * rwest is writing javascript code right now
2012-04-30T14:39:33  <thestinger> pypy is getting close to python3 support which will be awesome
2012-04-30T14:40:17  <mcstar> thestinger: pypy doesnt need py3k it needs numpy and scipy
2012-04-30T14:40:28  <rwest> "Congradulations you are an official supporter of Light Table!"
2012-04-30T14:40:30  <thestinger> it's getting that too
2012-04-30T14:40:34  <mcstar> it should support first things, where speed matters
2012-04-30T14:40:37  <mcstar> i hope so
2012-04-30T14:41:04  <mcstar> rwest: how much?
2012-04-30T14:41:10  <rwest> $15
2012-04-30T14:41:14  <mcstar> nice
2012-04-30T14:41:22  <mcstar> you dont get anything for that
2012-04-30T14:41:29  <rwest> you get a license
2012-04-30T14:41:37  <mcstar> ah yeah, but its gonna be free
2012-04-30T14:41:53  <rwest> then what is the point of a license? lol
2012-04-30T14:42:00  <thestinger> mcstar: are you sure?
2012-04-30T14:42:09  <mcstar> they said the core is going to be free
2012-04-30T14:42:23  <mcstar> as far as i can remember
2012-04-30T14:42:27  <mcstar> its in the text
2012-04-30T14:42:35  <mcstar> (its been a while since i read it)
2012-04-30T14:43:01  <rwest> What's a license then?
2012-04-30T14:43:02  <rwest> In order to download packaged distributions, you'll need a license. Preliminarily, we're thinking licenses will be based on a "pay what you can/what you believe it is worth" model for individuals. This gives everyone access to the tools to help shape our future, but also helps us stick around to continue making the platform awesome. We think what we build will be worth at least $50, and so that's what we've used for our rewards.
2012-04-30T14:43:52  <thestinger> mcstar: they're also working on implementing STM which will be awesome
2012-04-30T14:44:05  <thestinger> the ability to flip off the GIL
2012-04-30T14:44:24  <thestinger> maybe even get rid of it if they actually manage to make it as fast for single-threaded stuff
2012-04-30T14:44:48  <mcstar> rwest: i dont remember that part, when i first read it, the page was different
2012-04-30T14:44:50  <mcstar> too
2012-04-30T14:45:06  <thestinger> http://morepypy.blogspot.ca/2012/04/numpy-on-pypy-progress-report.html
2012-04-30T14:45:26  <mcstar> thestinger: and ofc, pypy needs ipython support
2012-04-30T14:49:24  <thestinger> mcstar: I think ipython might actually be pure python
2012-04-30T14:49:46  <mcstar> when i last checked it didnt support pypy
2012-04-30T14:49:52  <mcstar> things can change in a couple months
2012-04-30T14:50:30  <thestinger> mcstar: apparently it works from git
2012-04-30T14:50:45  <mcstar> yay for pypy then
2012-04-30T14:51:02  <thestinger> cpython was just developed in a stupid way
2012-04-30T14:51:11  <thestinger> x is too slow in python -> code it in C
2012-04-30T14:51:16  <thestinger> instead of making the language faster

2012-04-30T14:59:00  <rwest> why make something faster when you can just use c?
2012-04-30T14:59:31  <Zannick> why make c faster when you can just write asm?
2012-04-30T14:59:51  <rwest> why make asm faster when you can write microcode
2012-04-30T15:00:22  <Zannick> why make microcode faster when you can take an axe to the computer and start from scratch with a better one?

2012-04-30T15:03:32  <mcstar> python is for managing PITA
2012-04-30T15:03:42  <mcstar> but it is a PITA if it is too slow
2012-04-30T15:04:52  <thestinger> mcstar: I find it easy to translate python -> high level C++ though
2012-04-30T15:04:59  <thestinger> if speed actually matters
2012-04-30T15:05:42  <mcstar> i use python for things i coulnt do in c++

2012-04-30T15:11:09  <mcstar> well, i did ml week1/2 and logic week 1/2 because of lack of crypto
2012-04-30T15:11:49  <thestinger> the udacity courses are boring
2012-04-30T15:12:01  <thestinger> I've just skipped the lectures and done the homework, which is mostly just fun puzzles
2012-04-30T15:12:10  <thestinger> so that is barely using any time :P
2012-04-30T15:12:37  <thestinger> peter norvig's course there is really good but it's meant to be a follow-up to the cs101 so it's too simple
2012-04-30T15:13:27  <thestinger> and the programming languages course is good (regex, parsers, lexers, etc.)
2012-04-30T15:13:43  <thestinger> the web application one is awful :P
2012-04-30T15:14:21  <thestinger> and the crypto one has some nice tidbits of info and puzzles that weren't in crypto-class but not any new theory

2012-04-30T19:30:35  <amstan> j3camero: zannick and a few others feel like joining zeta though
2012-04-30T19:30:36  <j3camero> I will be living in the US soon so we also have the option of setting up there instead of Canada
2012-04-30T19:31:06  <j3camero> Or in addition to Canada
2012-04-30T19:31:53  <j3camero> Yeah I feel like building zeta now that I have more free time
2012-04-30T19:32:01  <amstan> feel free
2012-04-30T19:32:16  <j3camero> I will have to update myself on what has already been built. I have been out of the loop for a while.
2012-04-30T19:32:32  <amstan> see the zeta branch, i have a bunch of code from last year, i think i spent like an hour on it
2012-04-30T19:32:42  <amstan> jbroman did some core stuff for the worker
2012-04-30T19:33:05  <amstan> not sure how it compares to janzert's new worker that he made for epsilon2
2012-04-30T19:33:33  <Zannick> epsilon2 is so far out
2012-04-30T19:33:41  <amstan> Zannick: hmm?
2012-04-30T19:33:54  <j3camero> Yeah I remember jbroman's work on that
2012-04-30T19:34:03  <Zannick> jbroman and i stopped working on zeta many months before ants launched
2012-04-30T19:34:20  <j3camero> Im sure there is stuff in zeta that can be used though
2012-04-30T19:34:22  <amstan> well.. i'm calling it that because we evolved epsilon so far that it pretty much became its own thing
2012-04-30T19:35:11  <Zannick> i'm sure zeta is salvageable but i wouldn't attempt to merge epsilon in or anything
2012-04-30T19:35:45  <j3camero> Youre right. Iunderstood that zeta was meant as a rewrite anyways
2012-04-30T19:36:53  <j3camero> By the way Zannick, I left my old job in finance so I am no longer working insane hours. Much more time to build things now, as of last week.
2012-04-30T19:38:54  <Zannick> j3camero: cool.
2012-04-30T19:39:40  <j3camero> Wouldn't mind sitting down this week to build a fairly general distrobuted game-execution system.
2012-04-30T19:40:11  <j3camero> (Sorry for my horrible typing, I am on a very high latency connection on an inter-city train)
2012-04-30T19:40:25  <Zannick> we do need a good system for that, yeah
2012-04-30T19:40:37  <j3camero> I will have to see if jbroman already built on, and build on his.
2012-04-30T19:40:55  <amstan> j3camero: we can use that highest number game for testing
2012-04-30T19:41:27  <amstan> j3camero: oh.. in terms of trueskill mcleopold was working on that
2012-04-30T19:41:30  <j3camero> least unique positive integer?
2012-04-30T19:42:10  <j3camero> Yeah there were a lot of advanaceements in the scheduling and ranking areas, especially around handling multiplayer games.
2012-04-30T19:42:20  <amstan> https://github.com/McLeopold/PythonSkills
2012-04-30T19:42:47  <amstan> i have push access to that, but you might as well fork to aichallenge if you plan to add to it
2012-04-30T19:42:56  <j3camero> Yup sounds good
2012-04-30T19:43:11  <amstan> the last python library for trueskill that we were first thinking to use didn't work, had a bunc of calculation bugs
2012-04-30T19:43:16  <amstan> didn't match with the standard
2012-04-30T19:43:24  <amstan> so we had to use a js one i think
2012-04-30T19:43:30  <amstan> with a python wrapper around it
2012-04-30T19:43:44  <j3camero> impressive
2012-04-30T19:43:47  <j3camero> Node.js or something?
2012-04-30T19:43:59  <j3camero> Or V8?
2012-04-30T19:44:02  <amstan> idk, but it was a hack
2012-04-30T19:44:12  <j3camero> Yeah for sure
2012-04-30T19:44:12  <amstan> i think it's a git submodule in epsilon
2012-04-30T19:44:32  <j3camero> Sweet
2012-04-30T19:44:41  <amstan> https://github.com/moserware/PHPSkills
2012-04-30T19:44:42  <amstan> that
2012-04-30T19:44:46  <amstan> not javascript, sorry
2012-04-30T19:44:52  <j3camero> Nice
2012-04-30T19:46:00  <j3camero> Did that go okay? People generally perceived the rankings and scheduling to be fair? Or not so much?
2012-04-30T19:46:14  <amstan> it was fine, cpu time was the issue most of the time
2012-04-30T19:46:18  <amstan> for the workers
2012-04-30T19:46:34  <j3camero> For playing the game themselves or for scheduling the games?
2012-04-30T19:46:41  <amstan> games
2012-04-30T19:46:57  <j3camero> Yeah makes sense. This will probably always be the case
2012-04-30T19:47:11  <amstan> we didn't have enough games for a while, so the rankings were a little wonky
2012-04-30T19:47:15  *** choas <choas!~lars@p5795C6A9.dip.t-dialin.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
2012-04-30T19:47:21  <amstan> and people with more games would be ranked higher
2012-04-30T19:47:24  <j3camero> Unless we make people write their bots in JS and have them run in the people's browsers or something.
2012-04-30T19:47:27  <amstan> so it was a better idea to not resubmit
2012-04-30T19:48:04  <Zannick> the main goal we would like is to have the ability to increase game count simply by increasing the number of workers
2012-04-30T19:48:37  <j3camero> Was that the case during ants?
2012-04-30T19:48:45  <j3camero> If we light up more servers during ants, were more games not getting played?
2012-04-30T19:48:47  <amstan> idk, it was mostly ok
2012-04-30T19:49:24  <Zannick> i mean, as opposed to "increase number of workers, restart the manager, flip this flag, etc"
2012-04-30T19:49:27  <amstan> at one point the main server started dying, it couldn't generate teams anymore
2012-04-30T19:49:38  <amstan> so the workers were running out of games to play
2012-04-30T19:50:04  <j3camero> Zannick: gotcha.
2012-04-30T19:50:06  <Zannick> and that could be mitigated by paxos
2012-04-30T19:50:46  <amstan> paxos?
2012-04-30T19:50:57  <Zannick> paxos is a consensus algorithm
2012-04-30T19:51:16  <Zannick> useful for having one master among a set of servers
2012-04-30T19:51:33  <j3camero> Sounds hardcore distributed
2012-04-30T19:51:38  <Zannick> it is
2012-04-30T19:51:53  <Zannick> but the idea is, that when the manager goes down, a worker takes its place
2012-04-30T19:51:58  <Zannick> and the games continue
2012-04-30T19:52:30  <j3camero> Sounds decent. I can see how that would work.
2012-04-30T19:56:25  <Zannick> paxos might be overkill
2012-04-30T19:56:32  <Zannick> but the idea is the same
2012-04-30T19:57:08  <j3camero> Single points of failure are terrible, haha
2012-04-30T19:58:08  <j3camero> I have this idea to treat game engines that same way bots are treated now.
2012-04-30T19:58:30  <Zannick> i know you do
2012-04-30T19:58:54  <j3camero> We would have a referee program that lights up the "engine" and communicates with it over stdout and stdin, as well as all the bots.
2012-04-30T19:58:55  <Zannick> and that is an interesting yet frightening idea
2012-04-30T19:58:59  <j3camero> hehe
2012-04-30T19:59:21  <j3camero> Well even if we dont let people submit them randomly, it could still be useful int erms of making it easier for us to create new contests quickly.
2012-04-30T19:59:22  <Zannick> but if we generalize the worker/manager enough, probably okay
2012-04-30T19:59:33  <j3camero> That way all the scheduling and ranking stuff gets decoupled from the game itself.
2012-04-30T19:59:41  <Zannick> yeah, don't let them be free for all
2012-04-30T19:59:48  <j3camero> Yup
2012-04-30T19:59:59  <j3camero> If we could do this, then creating new contests would be fairly trivial.
2012-04-30T20:00:24  <j3camero> Just gotta create the new game engine, create new content for the site, and you're done
2012-04-30T20:01:00  <j3camero> Oh and a visualizer for the site. I think that has to be game-specific. I cant even imagine how we would create a generalized visualizer.
2012-04-30T20:01:28  <Zannick> we still want the games to be an admin controlled thing, since otherwise we risk diluting the contests too much
2012-04-30T20:01:39  <j3camero> Yep I hear that
2012-04-30T20:02:00  <Zannick> as well as needing to sandbox the engine which is all sorts of problems
2012-04-30T20:02:05  <jbroman> The risk you get with too much generalization is that you never finish the completely general solution.
2012-04-30T20:02:07  <j3camero> Potentially we could get around this problem by "featuring" only one contest at a time, even if others are running in the background with small niche groups of users.
2012-04-30T20:02:25  <j3camero> jbroman: absolutely.
2012-04-30T20:02:33  <jbroman> Given that we haven't even had *a* contest in some time, I think trying to run O(n) contests would be far too ambitious.
2012-04-30T20:02:43  <jbroman> (I'm using "we" loosely"  here.)
2012-04-30T20:02:44  <j3camero> Agreed
2012-04-30T20:02:53  <Zannick> right, but in creating the workers keep the engine code separate from the worker code
2012-04-30T20:03:03  <jbroman> I'm not saying no separation is necessary.
2012-04-30T20:03:08  <Zannick> separate enough that it will be easy later to decouple it
2012-04-30T20:03:11  <j3camero> Even if this gets built, we would only use it to run one contest at a time at the beginning. The end users wouldnt see these new features at first.
2012-04-30T20:03:22  <Zannick> that is how i am picturing it
2012-04-30T20:03:32  <jbroman> I'm just cognizant that my personal projects, at least, tend to devolve into the first 40% of a completely general solution rather than 100% of a smaller solution.
2012-04-30T20:04:21  <j3camero> jbroman: youre right. I also often have this problem. There is a lot to be said for just getting er done
2012-04-30T20:05:59  <jbroman> Anyhow, my project on zeta was somewhat stalled, but mostly because it suffers from the things-only-I-am-working-on syndrome (that is, without any other motivation I progressively make it unnecessarily complicated, then despair that it will never be done, then gradually stop working on it).
2012-04-30T20:06:19  <j3camero> haha
2012-04-30T20:06:24  <Zannick> haha
2012-04-30T20:07:08  <Zannick> i have been working hard on some projects only i am working on
2012-04-30T20:07:33  <j3camero> like what?
2012-04-30T20:07:35  <Zannick> they are sometimes very large in scope so i need to make lots of progress
2012-04-30T20:08:04  <Zannick> i am working on an antlr-based magic the gathering parser
2012-04-30T20:08:21  <Zannick> with the intent to build an engine later
2012-04-30T20:08:34  <j3camero> Oh sick.
2012-04-30T20:08:41  <Zannick> yes
2012-04-30T20:08:44  <j3camero> You mean in the context of an AI contest?
2012-04-30T20:08:45  <Zannick> it is very sick.
2012-04-30T20:08:58  <Zannick> no, not quite
2012-04-30T20:09:09  <j3camero> Or as a standalone game?
2012-04-30T20:09:21  <Zannick> i'm considering writing an ai for it
2012-04-30T20:09:37  <Zannick> but an ai contest for mtg is not a great idea for general mtg
2012-04-30T20:09:52  <Zannick> (i've thought about this)
2012-04-30T20:10:23  <j3camero> perhaps there is some way to strip away some of the details to leave only some core strategic nugget o the game
2012-04-30T20:10:49  <jbroman> I suspect the interesting parts of MTG are in the variation of the rules.
2012-04-30T20:10:55  <j3camero> kind of like how starcraft got boiled down to ants
2012-04-30T20:11:17  <amstan> there's also ants with destructable terrain
2012-04-30T20:11:18  <Zannick> the interaction between cards is the interesting bit
2012-04-30T20:11:20  <j3camero> I am not overly familiar with MTG so I cannot yet speculate on this
2012-04-30T20:11:53  <Zannick> but mtg has many many many places where different types of choices must be made
2012-04-30T20:11:54  <j3camero> But it seems like there are shitloads of people out there who already know the rules so MTG definitely has that going for it
2012-04-30T20:12:19  <jbroman> amstan: Not actually having participated in the ants contest (so take appropriate grains of salt), it feels like ants was already near the max reasonable complexity level.
2012-04-30T20:12:32  <jbroman> Barrier to entry, etc.
2012-04-30T20:12:39  <j3camero> true that. I was worried about it. But participation grew anyways
2012-04-30T20:12:42  <Zannick> what card do you play now? what ability do you activate? which creatures attack? which creatures block and how? etc.
2012-04-30T20:12:51  <Zannick> and those are only the common ones
2012-04-30T20:13:10  <jbroman> Other side of the equation is that some games can be resolved in fewer CPU cycles (and thus fewer dollars).
2012-04-30T20:13:26  <Zannick> i am going to have an absolute blast writing a magic ai with any sort of genetic or learning element
2012-04-30T20:13:38  <jbroman> Zannick: Training against each other?
2012-04-30T20:13:41  <jbroman> Or against a human?
2012-04-30T20:13:44  <j3camero> Zannick: do you think its possible to strip down the rules to the point where only one of the several game-theoretic nuggets of the game remains?
2012-04-30T20:13:49  <Zannick> both, potentially
2012-04-30T20:14:04  <Zannick> j3camero: yes. i do not know how to do this but i could think for a long time.
2012-04-30T20:14:21  <Zannick> i am afraid it won't be quite as interesting
2012-04-30T20:14:46  <j3camero> No doubt
2012-04-30T20:15:15  <j3camero> jbroman: its true what you say about some games being cheaper than others CPU-wise. That's a big factor. We have finite money, so more games per dollar is a good thing.
2012-04-30T20:20:30  <jbroman> I should get my zeta work into a workable state and then at least push that to my GH so that people can have a look and consider all possible starting points for moving forward.
2012-04-30T20:20:42  <j3camero> Indeed
2012-04-30T20:20:54  <j3camero> I am considering putting some time into it this week
2012-04-30T20:21:10  <jbroman> My time will be highly variable as I'm starting work again this week.
2012-04-30T20:21:22  <jbroman> Should be able to do something on the weekend at the latest, though.
2012-04-30T20:21:25  * jbroman crosses his fingers.
2012-04-30T20:22:04  <j3camero> I was thinking about playing Risk on the Wikipedia graph. Each article is a territory, and two articles are connected if there is a link between them.
2012-04-30T20:22:18  <jbroman> As one huge game?
2012-04-30T20:22:26  <jbroman> Also, the full wiki graph is pretty damned big.
2012-04-30T20:22:35  <j3camero> This would be hilarious because people would start to edit articles to work in links that will benefit them.
2012-04-30T20:22:55  <j3camero> MAybe on some subset of the link graph
2012-04-30T20:23:02  <j3camero> Like articles that matter more than X
2012-04-30T20:23:22  <jbroman> j3camero: So, a few additional thoughts. (a) maintaining live synchronization with Wikipedia proper is probably more trouble than it's worth, and (b) Wiki editors might not like incentives for vandalism. :P
2012-04-30T20:23:29  <j3camero> Where the importance of an article is computed using pagerank or somesuch
2012-04-30T20:23:38  <amstan> lol
2012-04-30T20:23:42  <jbroman> (Not to dump on your idea. Just thinking aloud.)
2012-04-30T20:23:49  <j3camero> jbroman: oh yes, this would definitelyt cuse conflict with wikipedia.
2012-04-30T20:23:52  <amstan> vandalizing wikipedia to increase one's ranking
2012-04-30T20:24:05  <amstan> or we could take a snapshot when the contest starts
2012-04-30T20:24:14  <amstan> and use that for the rest of the contest
2012-04-30T20:24:21  <j3camero> Basically trying to think of games that are persistent or involve interacting with something out in the "real world"
2012-04-30T20:24:30  <amstan> won't people get lost in the articles though? there's a lot of the
2012-04-30T20:24:32  <amstan> them*
2012-04-30T20:24:54  <j3camero> Yeah probably. It's a terrible idea
2012-04-30T20:24:54  <jbroman> I suspect English wiki is too big to be reasonable.
2012-04-30T20:25:17  <j3camero> AI Contest 2012: Taking Back Catalan Wiki
2012-04-30T20:25:35  <jbroman> Actually, just picking one word out of that:
2012-04-30T20:25:41  <jbroman> How complicated is Settlers of Catan?
2012-04-30T20:25:45  <jbroman> (And is it a solved problem?)
2012-04-30T20:25:55  <j3camero> I have played once. People love it
2012-04-30T20:26:02  <jbroman> I know it's a fun game.
2012-04-30T20:26:07  <jbroman> I'm just wondering whether it's too easy/too hard.
2012-04-30T20:26:16  <jbroman> Otherwise I think it's a great candidate.
2012-04-30T20:26:21  <jbroman> (Oh, and copyright concerns I suppose.)
2012-04-30T20:26:28  <j3camero> It works on a hexaagonal grid right? We could probably simplify that by putting it on a square lattice instead
2012-04-30T20:26:43  <jbroman> Are hexagons that complicated, though?
2012-04-30T20:26:57  <jbroman> (I mean, you're always viewing it as a graph anyhow.)
2012-04-30T20:27:00  <j3camero> Hard to represent I think
2012-04-30T20:27:23  <j3camero> People like to think of things in terms of (x,y) rather than general graphs I would guess
2012-04-30T20:27:45  <j3camero> But yeah that's a side issue. It's a great game because so many people love it
2012-04-30T20:28:00  <jbroman> Main concern is whether there's a shortcut solution.
2012-04-30T20:28:12  <j3camero> Yeah or if it's degenerate
2012-04-30T20:28:36  <j3camero> Like, if computers are able to build impregnable defences or something
2012-04-30T20:29:33  <Zannick> hm, so ccgs are weird for our usage, since they are inherently unequal
2012-04-30T20:30:02  <Zannick> there's the deckbuilding aspect, then the orders of decks are randomized
2012-04-30T20:30:07  <j3camero> I will also throw in the idea of a MMO RTS. A persistent world where the bots can move their units about and attack each other, take resources, whatever. Whenever someone conquers the whole map the world resets and everyone gets a fresh start.
2012-04-30T20:30:15  <Zannick> hard to provide symmetry
2012-04-30T20:30:25  <jbroman> Also not conducive to evaluating progress.
2012-04-30T20:30:43  <jbroman> Hard to tell if your bot's performance is a result of it sucking or its predecessor getting into a bad spot.
2012-04-30T20:30:54  <j3camero> Games could last a few hours or a few minutes or a few days. Hard to say
2012-04-30T20:31:01  <Zannick> but the main element is resource management, both during deckbuilding and play
2012-04-30T20:32:00  <j3camero> Zannick jbroman: is there a way to take some of the randomness out of it? Or reduce the randomness?
2012-04-30T20:32:10  <jbroman> j3camero: Randomness of which?
2012-04-30T20:32:50  <Zannick> i'm talking about ccgs.
2012-04-30T20:32:51  <j3camero> jbroman: Magic the Gathering, right?
2012-04-30T20:32:58  <j3camero> Oh, CCGs?
2012-04-30T20:33:07  <jbroman> j3camero: MTG is a CCG
2012-04-30T20:33:11  <j3camero> Oh okay.
2012-04-30T20:33:12  <jbroman> (Collectible Card Game)
2012-04-30T20:33:35  <j3camero> Yeah thats what I mean. Can we take some of the randomness out of it? Make the games more fair?
2012-04-30T20:33:40  *** jcdjcd <jcdjcd!~bugnuts@pool-96-250-46-137.nycmny.fios.verizon.net> has joined #aichallenge
2012-04-30T20:33:40  <jbroman> You can reduce that by making deck assignment fair (e.g. opponents have the same deck, or bots can choose their own deck fairly).
2012-04-30T20:33:42  <Zannick> we could have the bots build decks from a fixed set *and* play each other
2012-04-30T20:33:51  <Zannick> but that is quite complex
2012-04-30T20:34:09  <j3camero> Or how about letting the players manually choose their decks on the website?
2012-04-30T20:34:23  <j3camero> Then their bots get that deck
2012-04-30T20:35:06  <Zannick> that could also be specified in game as part of the setup turn
2012-04-30T20:35:20  <jbroman> My bigger concern is that CCGs are in general too complicated for small bots to understand.
2012-04-30T20:35:24  <jbroman> As each card introduces rules.
2012-04-30T20:35:29  <Zannick> yes
2012-04-30T20:35:38  <j3camero> Oh yeah thats quite insane
2012-04-30T20:35:52  <Zannick> we could do an ordinary type of card game
2012-04-30T20:35:59  <j3camero> We cant do starcraft for this reason, but we can do ants. Its possible we could strip down MTG in this way
2012-04-30T20:36:25  <j3camero> I have heard poker suggested a lot.
2012-04-30T20:36:38  <jbroman> My suspicion is that poker has been heavily analyzed.

2012-04-30T20:36:49  <jbroman> (i.e. it is likely possible to write an "optimal" bot given reasonable constraints)
2012-04-30T20:36:53  <Zannick> i think in general we can't strip mtg down enough without making it solvable.
2012-04-30T20:41:03  <j3camero> HEres an idea for a really simple poker game. I dont know if its degenerate or not. Each bot is dealt five cards that only they can see. The turn passes from bot to bot one after the other. The bot has the choice to either raise by one or fold. The hand ends when all but two bots fold. The winning hand keeps the whole pot.
2012-04-30T20:41:59  <j3camero> ITs simple and has really great "starter package" strategies. For example, if you have a pair bid up to 50 otherwise fold. Its not perfect but it would beat a random bot.
2012-04-30T20:42:43  <Zannick> degenerate
2012-04-30T20:42:43  <j3camero> Is it?
2012-04-30T20:42:43  <j3camero> Can a bot get ahead by lying every now and then?
2012-04-30T20:42:43  <Zannick> needs a max ;)
2012-04-30T20:43:35  <Zannick> needs a max bet, calls, and handling for equal hands
2012-04-30T20:45:17  <Zannick> a sort of liar's game would be interesting
2012-04-30T20:45:22  <Zannick> ever played liar's dice?
2012-04-30T20:45:42  <j3camero> Nope, should read about it
2012-04-30T20:45:50  <Zannick> similar to your suggestion
2012-04-30T20:45:51  <j3camero> Will wikipedia that shit
2012-04-30T20:46:00  <Zannick> but players are bidding on the collective total of the dice
2012-04-30T20:46:28  <Zannick> and each player has the option to raise the bid or call the previous bid as false
2012-04-30T20:46:53  <Zannick> each round one player loses a die, until one player still has dice
2012-04-30T20:47:53  <Zannick> actually it is simple enough and complicated enough to be interesting
2012-04-30T20:48:01  <Zannick> we won't exactly have maps for it, though
2012-04-30T20:48:20  <Zannick> though i suppose we could vary the types of dice given to each player
2012-04-30T20:48:40  <Zannick> liars' dice is usually 5d6 per player.
2012-04-30T20:49:17  <Zannick> it really ends up being mostly expectation, but there is some bluffing element to it
2012-04-30T20:50:17  <j3camero> Yeah definitely
2012-04-30T20:50:25  <j3camero> Especially if each player can only increase the bid by one
2012-04-30T20:50:50  <j3camero> Then some players might have no choice but to implicitly announce that their hand (or dice or whatever) are worth a certain amount
2012-04-30T20:50:58  <j3camero> Or they could be lying
2012-04-30T20:51:18  <j3camero> Then aa second palyer can raise the bid even if his hand is worthless just to make it more expensive for the first player
2012-04-30T20:51:33  <j3camero> But the first player may have deceived him
2012-04-30T20:51:37  <j3camero> etc etc
2012-04-30T20:53:11  <j3camero> The most successful bots would have to do some opponent modeling to figure out who is honest and who is not
2012-04-30T20:53:11  <j3camero> Or to find bots that are honest and exploit them like crazy
2012-04-30T20:53:11  <j3camero> g2g2 arriving at train station
2012-04-30T20:53:11  <j3camero> Will be around tomorrow likely
2012-04-30T20:53:11  <j3camero> good ideas all around
2012-04-30T20:53:24  <Zannick> o/
2012-04-30T20:54:37  <Zannick> i think restricting raises by one narrows it too much
2012-04-30T20:55:45  <Zannick> i'll think about this some more
