2011-09-05T05:34:46  <antimatroid> @later tell McLeopold: perhaps those at least should be fixed first

2011-09-05T05:35:13  <Zr40> I'd say the horrible site slowness should be fixed as well
2011-09-05T05:35:47  <antimatroid> yeah that should be a problem until we launch
2011-09-05T05:35:50  <mcstar> thats a feature not a bug
2011-09-05T05:35:55  <antimatroid> because the beta site is hosted on a different server

2011-09-05T05:36:54  <mcstar> antimatroid: i have a smaller implementation of the power set function
2011-09-05T05:37:13  <antimatroid> different algorithm or same idea?
2011-09-05T05:37:34  <mcstar> same idea, but with my current understanding of lisp, the one you saw was my first useful lisp code
2011-09-05T05:37:40  <antimatroid> if i was getting the power set of something i'd probably just be lazy and iterate through binary numbers like you said
2011-09-05T05:37:48  <antimatroid> i don't understand lisp :P
2011-09-05T05:37:51  <mcstar> yeah, i think thats good
2011-09-05T05:38:10  <mcstar> have you seen the haskell version,
2011-09-05T05:38:13  <mcstar> ?
2011-09-05T05:38:17  <antimatroid> nope
2011-09-05T05:38:22  <antimatroid> don't really understand that either
2011-09-05T05:38:24  <mcstar> i wanted to discuss it with jmcarthur but he's never around

2011-09-05T05:41:07  <mcstar> actually, this gives you back a function which you can call repeatedly, enumerating the subsets

2011-09-05T09:12:21  <mcstar> not completely
2011-09-05T09:12:35  <mcstar> so hi
2011-09-05T09:12:40  <mcstar> jmcarthur:
2011-09-05T09:13:26  <mcstar> or did we?
2011-09-05T09:13:59  <mcstar> well, ive got a couple of question with the impressive filterM code of yours
2011-09-05T09:14:10  <jmcarthur> alright
2011-09-05T09:14:31  <jmcarthur> i was typing up a little explanation just now, but maybe i can explain it here more briefly
2011-09-05T09:14:46  <mcstar> well, you can finish, i have to dry
2011-09-05T09:15:07  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-09-05T09:16:17  <mcstar> btw i tried it in  prelude, but apparently i didnt load some package before
2011-09-05T09:17:28  <jmcarthur> mcstar: you need Control.Monad in scope
2011-09-05T09:18:29  <mcstar> import?
2011-09-05T09:19:07  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-09-05T09:19:09  <jmcarthur> well
2011-09-05T09:19:13  <jmcarthur> in a source file that's what you do
2011-09-05T09:19:24  <jmcarthur> in ghci you say    :m + Control.Monad
2011-09-05T09:19:46  <jmcarthur> i think import works in ghci in some new version of ghc, but i haven't tried it
2011-09-05T09:19:54  <mcstar> well, it worked with import, i have the powerset
2011-09-05T09:20:47  <mcstar> nice, now come the questions
2011-09-05T09:21:03  <mcstar> this is kind of very high level of abstraction
2011-09-05T09:21:38  <mcstar> does this work for you? doesnt it take significantly more time to come up with this kind of code, than just to write down the algorithm?
2011-09-05T09:21:38  <jmcarthur> i could give a quick overview of what's going on
2011-09-05T09:21:57  <mcstar> sure
2011-09-05T09:21:59  <jmcarthur> it's actually quite intuitive once you see the explanation :)
2011-09-05T09:22:20  <jmcarthur> so, you are aware of the filter function, I assume (without the M)
2011-09-05T09:22:30  <mcstar> now i am
2011-09-05T09:22:44  <jmcarthur> it just applies a predicate to the elements of a list and removes the elements for which the predicate fails
2011-09-05T09:22:51  <mcstar> (my experience with haskell is copy-paste based :))
2011-09-05T09:23:07  <jmcarthur> okay, now, another prerequisite is the list monad
2011-09-05T09:23:16  <jmcarthur> i suppose i can't assume you know it?
2011-09-05T09:23:27  <mcstar> i have a vague idea of a monad
2011-09-05T09:23:35  <mcstar> other than a deity of course
2011-09-05T09:23:36  <jmcarthur> heh, i wouldn't worry about monads in general
2011-09-05T09:23:43  <jmcarthur> just the list monad suffices here
2011-09-05T09:24:06  <jmcarthur> the list monad basically gives you an environment where you can program with nondeterminism
2011-09-05T09:25:09  <jmcarthur> if i say:    do { x <- [1..10] ; y <- [x..10] ; return (x + y) }   then... well, run that in ghci :)
2011-09-05T09:25:21  <mcstar> i thought there would be nond. programming involved :)
2011-09-05T09:25:32  <mcstar> ok
2011-09-05T09:25:37  <jmcarthur> basically, that means you are drawing x from [1..10] and y from [x..10]
2011-09-05T09:25:52  <mcstar> this is just a matrix right?
2011-09-05T09:25:55  <jmcarthur> the result of all this is going to be a list of all possibilities
2011-09-05T09:26:00  <jmcarthur> of adding x and y
2011-09-05T09:26:11  <jmcarthur> and notice that the choices for y depends on the current choice for x
2011-09-05T09:26:14  <jmcarthur> and so on
2011-09-05T09:26:26  <jmcarthur> the list monad basically gives you a complete nondeterministic environment
2011-09-05T09:26:35  <jmcarthur> i'll wait for you to catch up
2011-09-05T09:26:50  <jmcarthur> i didn't intend for that example to resemble any real algorithm. i was just trying to demonstrate some points
2011-09-05T09:26:52  <mcstar> im there
2011-09-05T09:26:58  <jmcarthur> alright cool
2011-09-05T09:27:07  <jmcarthur> so, now we get to filterM
2011-09-05T09:27:17  <mcstar> its interesting that the output is a list, not a matrix
2011-09-05T09:27:44  <jmcarthur> yes. the point is that this is just a list of all possibilities. this is not n-dimensional programming
2011-09-05T09:28:03  <jmcarthur> maybe we should linger on the list monad for a bit longer
2011-09-05T09:28:17  <mcstar> linger we do :)
2011-09-05T09:28:41  <mcstar> so for the prev. code, is the control.monad needed?
2011-09-05T09:29:09  <mcstar> i gues it is, so is do or {} means nondeterminism?
2011-09-05T09:29:10  <jmcarthur> no, everything necessary for that is in the prelude
2011-09-05T09:29:14  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-09-05T09:29:21  <jmcarthur> no, do is much more generic than that
2011-09-05T09:29:33  <jmcarthur> in the case of the list monad, it essentially means nondeterminism
2011-09-05T09:30:19  <jmcarthur> in the case of the IO monad, it's interaction with the real world. in the case of the Maybe monad, it represents the possibility of failure... the list goes on
2011-09-05T09:30:35  <mcstar> jmcarthur: dont we want to go private?
2011-09-05T09:30:38  <jmcarthur> do notation is, in fact, just sugar
2011-09-05T09:30:40  <jmcarthur> sure

2011-09-05T12:54:28  <mleise> McLeopold: care to give me some insight? I had my own ideas, but they all ended up in the match making working properly, but the rules were not well chosen to begin with
2011-09-05T12:57:06  <mleise> I think the two player maps are a result of no more than two players being available to the match making algorithm, right? Or are maps chosen randomly and then the engine assigns the player slots even with players that are a bad match?

2011-09-05T15:03:57  <mcstar> and another thing, is that when you start repeating something, in your mother-tongue, after some time, it will seem meaningless
2011-09-05T15:04:26  <mcstar> you somehow detach the maning from the form(phonetics)
2011-09-05T15:04:54  <mcstar> well, with a foreign language that experience can never happen, because you have learn it another way
