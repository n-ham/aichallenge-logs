2012-05-25T19:25:51  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: is that not what i think it is?
2012-05-25T19:25:59  <antimatroid1> food harvesting without spawning?
2012-05-25T19:27:06  <a1k0n> basically except you can occupy the same space, and scoring is different
2012-05-25T19:27:17  <a1k0n> also their ranking system is % wins, which is terrible
2012-05-25T19:27:50  <antimatroid1> 10 seconds per move
2012-05-25T19:27:52  <antimatroid1> yikes
2012-05-25T19:28:01  <antimatroid1> that's going to kill them
2012-05-25T19:28:12  <antimatroid1> if they get many takers
2012-05-25T19:28:26  <antimatroid1> and javascript eww :P
2012-05-25T19:28:58  <antimatroid1> i might have a think about the problem later
2012-05-25T19:29:06  <antimatroid1> i have to go do the scorebaord for a hockey game in a minute
2012-05-25T19:29:13  <antimatroid1> (friggin duties :()
2012-05-25T19:29:46  <a1k0n> yeah i'm not sure which javascript engine they're using cuz it's not nearly as fast on their server as it is in chrome on my laptop
2012-05-25T19:29:58  <a1k0n> and i'm not sure whether you can use setTimeout preemptively
