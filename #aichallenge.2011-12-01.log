2011-12-01T00:54:24  <BenJackson> it's an utter fluke in this case the hill caps were only 1 turn apart
2011-12-01T00:54:46  <ChrisH_> then it sounds like the time spent avoiding the risk of it making your bot worse outweighs any advantage you gain, so my answer is, no, don't do it.
2011-12-01T00:55:11  <ChrisH_> i would hope you have more valuable features to add still

2011-12-01T00:59:44  <BenJackson> I actually found it to be interesting from the point of view that I had no aspect to my bot that would have allowed me to spell out anything
2011-12-01T00:59:50  <BenJackson> it got me thinking about what his internals must be like
2011-12-01T01:00:38  <ChrisH_> hmmm, well if I wanted to add such a feature I would need to add a set of ant targets with the GG formation and then they would flow there based on my path finding

2011-12-01T01:01:18  <BenJackson> at the time if I did that it would have just caused all of my ants to converge in a blob surrounding the outline of "GG"
2011-12-01T01:01:47  <ChrisH_> well yeah, at that time my bot would have probably done that too, but not any more.
2011-12-01T01:02:13  <ChrisH_> anyway, I got a combat bug to fix, so I'm off IRC to concentrate. another time all

2011-12-01T01:44:40  <pairofdice> Hard to do fast enough in python
2011-12-01T01:45:26  <gazpachoking> Yeah, not sure how much time I have left after this. Using numpy it's something like 400x faster than the straight python though.
2011-12-01T01:45:31  <Falcon256> That is similar to what I'm doing in java, but mine persists through frames. It is ok for my first try but I think I will try it a different way.

2011-12-01T01:48:49  <Kommander> what are the tricks for numpy gazpa?
2011-12-01T01:50:57  <gazpachoking> You can use arrays, and operate on the whole thing at once, which means the only python loop in the diffusion code is the one to iterate through the steps.

2011-12-01T01:52:11  <pairofdice> ah, nice
2011-12-01T01:52:38  <gazpachoking> It's a bit more complicated and slower when you don't have a constant diffusion coefficient over your whole grid..
2011-12-01T01:53:03  <gazpachoking> I think there are probably optimizations that can be made to my code still..
2011-12-01T01:56:54  <gazpachoking> Oh I should probably make the goals/coefficient arrays part of the same array, so I can roll them at once.. maybe that will help.

2011-12-01T03:27:32  <bhasker> oops
2011-12-01T03:27:52  <antimatroid> i do a mini minimax thing which doesn't really require me to
2011-12-01T03:28:29  <bhasker> hmm well i just thought it will be easier to work with a reduced state so that
2011-12-01T03:28:34  <bhasker> i can restrict the stuff i look at
2011-12-01T03:28:42  <antimatroid> bhasker: have you considered trying to just pass the thing the locations and non-water blocked moves of each ant?
2011-12-01T03:28:48  <antimatroid> and writing up battle resolution etc. on that?
2011-12-01T03:30:17  <bhasker> yea tried that doesn't do so well
2011-12-01T03:30:32  <bhasker> well i am considering stuff like movetuples
2011-12-01T03:30:40  <bhasker> and don't solve it for individual ants
2011-12-01T03:30:46  <bhasker> i try and solve for groups if possible
2011-12-01T03:31:09  <bhasker> and mostly i don't use it to decide where to go
2011-12-01T03:31:19  <bhasker> once i decide where to go i see if its beneficial using minmax
2011-12-01T03:31:23  <bhasker> if not do something else
2011-12-01T03:31:32  <bhasker> so i use it to evaluate specific moves

2011-12-01T05:37:41  <tmc2> edited the tile class? huh?
2011-12-01T05:37:59  <tmc2> it's not necessary to give your ants state
2011-12-01T05:38:16  <tmc2> I simply optimised my A* algorithm so much that I can recompute each ant's path each turn :)
2011-12-01T05:38:59  <tmc2> but assuming that you want to save the A* results rather than recomputing, yes, you'll probably want to give ants state

2011-12-01T05:42:39  <duurtlang> i've added some getters and setters to the tile class for te f g and h values
2011-12-01T05:42:55  <tmc2> ah
2011-12-01T05:43:14  <duurtlang> but now i have no idea how to give the paths i generate to ants
2011-12-01T05:43:51  <RandomCoder> (I'm working together with duurtlang) Do we simply replace the Route class with the path of the A* algo?
2011-12-01T05:43:58  <tmc2> well to give ants states you'll want to map their positions to their state object
2011-12-01T05:44:20  <tmc2> I have no idea what language you're using or how your starter pack works
2011-12-01T05:44:31  <RandomCoder> Java
2011-12-01T05:44:44  <RandomCoder> And we are just using the starter Java package from the website
2011-12-01T05:44:50  <tmc2> anyway, so you'll need to calculate where each ant will be next turn (assuming it's not dead)
2011-12-01T05:45:00  <RandomCoder> hmmyes
2011-12-01T05:45:06  <tmc2> and then delete the states of all ants that no longer exist
2011-12-01T05:45:32  <RandomCoder> but isn't that already implemented in the starter package? Because the ants walk towards food already now
2011-12-01T05:45:52  <tmc2> I doubt it, it's not in any of the starter packs I've looked at
2011-12-01T05:46:06  <RandomCoder> + the tutorial btw
2011-12-01T05:46:10  <tmc2> oh
2011-12-01T05:46:19  <RandomCoder> http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial_step_2.php
2011-12-01T05:46:25  <tmc2> well I think all the starter packs have stateless ants
2011-12-01T05:46:31  <RandomCoder> True
2011-12-01T05:46:44  <tmc2> after doign the tutorial, your ants should just walk towards the nearest food each turn, iirc
2011-12-01T05:46:57  <RandomCoder> yeah, they do that now
2011-12-01T05:47:50  <tmc2> so as I said, map ant positions to state objects
2011-12-01T05:47:51  <RandomCoder> So we just have to save the path that is calculated for each ant, and check if where they are going still exists (if it's food)
2011-12-01T05:48:04  <tmc2> yes that would work
2011-12-01T05:48:18  <RandomCoder> k
2011-12-01T05:48:26  <RandomCoder> Now we gotta figure out how to code that :
2011-12-01T05:48:27  <RandomCoder> :D
2011-12-01T05:49:04  <RandomCoder> Thanks for your help, we're gonna try some stuff now

2011-12-01T05:59:26  <Minthos> I needed it in the beginning, but the algorithms I use now are better and make it unnecessary
2011-12-01T05:59:32  <tmc2> who needs state when you complusively optimise everything to the point that you can recompute it every turn :D
2011-12-01T06:00:23  <Minthos> I haven't done that, but yeah
2011-12-01T06:01:25  <Minthos> if an ant has a 'mission' to get a food, that same ant will usually be assigned to that same food the next turn as well
2011-12-01T06:01:32  <Minthos> so no need to give the ant that mission
2011-12-01T06:02:18  <Minthos> and I found that statefully grouping ants in squads for combat was more a hindrance than a tool
2011-12-01T06:02:21  <tmc2> yes exactly
2011-12-01T06:02:39  <Minthos> since groups can be calculated each turn based on proximity
2011-12-01T06:03:32  <tmc2> is it me, or is this contest being determined by who can make their bot do the least stupid things ratherthan being smart
2011-12-01T06:03:55  <tmc2> for example, not computing paths once and following them even though the circumstances are constantly changing
2011-12-01T06:04:24  <Garf> strength is often determined by the weakest part
2011-12-01T06:04:43  <Garf> better to everything half-assed than some things great and others not at all
2011-12-01T06:05:24  <Minthos> I think good combat is most important
2011-12-01T06:05:32  <Minthos> pretty difficult to get right
2011-12-01T06:05:53  <Minthos> then you just need to decide on some macro/econ strategies
2011-12-01T06:06:02  <Minthos> maybe do something clever now and then

2011-12-01T06:07:31  <tmc2> I'm starting to think that short-term combat is less important than I thought
2011-12-01T06:08:15  <Garf> I implemented it near-optimally in my bot and I got like 1.0 mu increase
2011-12-01T06:08:18  <tmc2> in particular, maneuvering well
2011-12-01T06:08:35  <tmc2> implemented combat near optimally?
2011-12-01T06:08:48  <Garf> I'm guessing that's because it doesn't care what/where it's fighting
2011-12-01T06:08:59  <tmc2> well it seems to me that even the best bots suck at maneuvering
2011-12-01T06:09:19  <Garf> doing optimal local minimax is difficult if the amount of ants in a fight gets big
2011-12-01T06:10:26  <tmc2> I think people are a little too attached to minimax just because it computes a nash equilibrium in a zero sum game
2011-12-01T06:10:43  <Garf> I'm "attached" to it because it's locally optimal
2011-12-01T06:10:59  <tmc2> no it's not
2011-12-01T06:11:05  <tmc2> combat isn't a zero sum game
2011-12-01T06:11:28  <tmc2> and minimax is really only applicable if you want to make no assumptions about what the opponent will do
2011-12-01T06:11:34  <tmc2> I'd use expectimax instead
2011-12-01T06:11:50  <Garf> when fighting a top bot, assuming optimal behavior is reasonable
2011-12-01T06:12:00  <Garf> (I think that's why the top bots stalemate fights so much)
2011-12-01T06:12:09  <tmc2> just what i was about to say
2011-12-01T06:12:25  <tmc2> they're using a minmax rule
2011-12-01T06:12:25  <Garf> as for the zero sum issue, that depends on the values you assign to the outcomes
2011-12-01T06:12:54  <tmc2> but as I said, that's only "optimal" in one sense (a very conservative one)
2011-12-01T06:13:41  <tmc2> oh well actually, I doubt they're using minmax
2011-12-01T06:13:58  <tmc2> wait, nvm

2011-12-01T09:27:21  <thestinger> oh, libstdc++ just needs a patch and it will work with clang 3.0
2011-12-01T09:27:29  <thestinger> and then my bot will compile with clang :)

2011-12-01T09:28:00  <tmc2> clang? why do you want that? can you use it on the official server?
2011-12-01T09:28:11  <tmc2> or do you just want better error message?
2011-12-01T09:28:26  <thestinger> tmc2: sane compiler errors, different warnings than g++, static analysis

2011-12-01T10:37:46  <Kommander> it's more the max(row,col) * 5

2011-12-01T10:42:14  <gazpachoking> rwest: Yeah, that's what I do.
2011-12-01T10:42:48  <gazpachoking> Kommander: Did you do something so that the diffusion coefficient for water is 0? Maybe I am doing that bit wrong and slowing mine down.
2011-12-01T10:43:52  <rwest> gazpachoking: I don't diffuse if it is a water tile
2011-12-01T10:44:03  <rwest> don't diffuse from it or to it
2011-12-01T10:44:18  <gazpachoking> Yeah, that's what I'm doing, just not sure if I am doing it right.
2011-12-01T10:44:35  <gazpachoking> I make another map of diffusion coefficients, with water having 0
2011-12-01T10:45:00  <Kommander> mine has water at 0, yes
2011-12-01T10:45:27  <rwest> since I 0 out my map between each diffusion, I get water at 0
2011-12-01T10:47:45  <gazpachoking> rwest: Hmm, you zero out the heat of the water tiles between each diffusion?
2011-12-01T10:48:04  <gazpachoking> Doesn't that mean they are still absorbing heat?
2011-12-01T10:48:14  <rwest> well I put my newly diffused values into a new map
2011-12-01T10:48:22  <rwest> that starts as all 0
2011-12-01T10:48:50  <rwest> since I add nothing to water tiles, diffusion does not go through them

2011-12-01T11:37:55  <thestinger> Fluxid: my hill died so my ants stopped gathering food and looking for it :)
2011-12-01T11:38:21  <Fluxid> i have similar logic
2011-12-01T11:38:22  <thestinger> there was no hope of killing you though :(
2011-12-01T11:38:30  <thestinger> stupid 1 wide chokepoint
2011-12-01T11:38:47  <thestinger> I hate that map
2011-12-01T11:38:53  <thestinger> and the other random walks :P
2011-12-01T11:39:00  <Fluxid> but ants still try to keep area visible, i must change their roles to attackers... that's a good thing to do next
2011-12-01T11:39:28  <Fluxid> spec mentiones something about traversing with 3x3 square
2011-12-01T11:39:38  <Fluxid> but "details are being worked on"
2011-12-01T11:40:03  <thestinger> my defense is basically broken
2011-12-01T11:40:21  <Fluxid> your ants at least panic when enemy is near hive
2011-12-01T11:40:37  <Fluxid> you can easily push my defenders away from hill and raze it
2011-12-01T11:40:47  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-01T11:40:50  <thestinger> yeah they try to defend
2011-12-01T11:40:56  <thestinger> but there are a dozen flaws with how it works :P
2011-12-01T11:41:30  <thestinger> like I pick ants closer to my hill as defenders first, so the ones closest to the enemy won't end up defenders, but won't be able to leave
2011-12-01T11:41:40  <rwest> I weight enemy ants near my hill more as they approach it
2011-12-01T11:41:47  <thestinger> yeah, I do that
2011-12-01T11:41:55  <thestinger> I need to increase the weight
2011-12-01T11:42:14  <Fluxid> ah, cool idea
2011-12-01T11:42:30  <thestinger> atm I just set the initial distance they are on the map to enemies as the distance they are from the hill
2011-12-01T11:42:35  <thestinger> so it's not weighted very much
2011-12-01T11:42:48  <thestinger> if that makes any sense :)
2011-12-01T11:43:52  <rwest> my current AI still loses to my prior generation AI

2011-12-01T12:45:11  <Antimony> olexs, it avoids food to get to the hill faster
2011-12-01T12:45:24  <Antimony> the weighting between food and hills depends on current number of ants

2011-12-01T13:23:24  <UncleVasya> I've heard dropbox is greedy to traffic. My reason is not my stupidness, but the limit of 20 mb per day.
2011-12-01T13:24:10  <UncleVasya> I don't feel like you must be sorry for something so never mind.
2011-12-01T13:24:37  <thestinger> 20 mb per day? :0
2011-12-01T13:24:48  <thestinger> dropbox will probably burn through that, I agree

2011-12-01T13:33:43  <BenJackson> from my earliest work I always kind of assumed you could just throw more ants at a problem and it would go away
2011-12-01T13:34:02  <thestinger> BenJackson: how do you evaluate whether attacking would be a good idea?
2011-12-01T13:34:11  <thestinger> I get a int with a score for a given situation
2011-12-01T13:34:40  <BenJackson> yeah, I score based on how many ants I have and how well defended it is
2011-12-01T13:34:44  <BenJackson> plus misc special cases
2011-12-01T13:35:10  <BenJackson> it finds it very important to kill off very close hills, too
2011-12-01T13:35:16  <thestinger> so if you control most of the map and you have a bunch of ants, will you sacrifice more ants in a battle?
2011-12-01T13:35:29  <BenJackson> but if it will stalemate in a 3-wide hallway then I should just seal it off and go on with life
2011-12-01T13:35:38  <thestinger> I guess it's a good idea to build up for a bit if you control lots of territory
2011-12-01T13:35:54  <BenJackson> I will sacrifice with more ants, but I haven't really quantified what that rule does

2011-12-01T13:37:32  <BenJackson> if I had just accepted that stalemate there and ignored it I would have been fine
2011-12-01T13:38:01  <BenJackson> but my game logic dates back to pre-combat suicide marches so it just figures if it throws more ants in the clog will clear up
2011-12-01T13:38:27  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-01T13:38:27  <rwest> BenJackson: you must have some complicated code for fighting
2011-12-01T13:38:42  <rwest> BenJackson: and you should put your bot with attack code back on bhickey.net
2011-12-01T13:38:58  <rwest> your ants keep running from me
2011-12-01T13:39:00  <thestinger> rwest: I bet his fighting is actually really simple :)
2011-12-01T13:39:04  <thestinger> simple things usually work better
2011-12-01T13:39:43  <rwest> thestinger: mine uses a bfs to find adjacent ants and weight them correctly, it's evil

2011-12-01T13:53:27  <rwest> woah, I just looked at my code and noticed I was attacking ants only when I was outnumbered, not the other way around

2011-12-01T13:56:32  <lbeew> do you guys use A* search algorithms?
2011-12-01T13:56:34  <thestinger> I just rewrote my combat in a way where it can't timeout, and I'll add combat that uses up the rest of the turn afterwards
2011-12-01T13:56:46  <Minthos> My bot hasn't needed it lately either, but it's nice to have in case something weird happens
2011-12-01T13:56:50  <thestinger> my current bots only use ~20-40ms with 100+ ants in battles
2011-12-01T13:56:57  <lbeew> wow
2011-12-01T13:57:10  <lbeew> what language are you coding in
2011-12-01T13:57:11  <thestinger> pre-combat is 4ms to 10ms
2011-12-01T13:57:13  <thestinger> C++
2011-12-01T13:57:25  <lbeew> what kind of path finding algorithm?
2011-12-01T13:57:48  <thestinger> sort of a BFS to make distance maps, but with all kinds of hacks
2011-12-01T13:58:16  <thestinger> I guess it's like the reverse of the collaborative diffusion stuff
2011-12-01T13:58:34  <thestinger> incrementing values away from targets instead of spreading/diffusing them
2011-12-01T13:59:18  <thestinger> with just a BFS to get a distance map you can get distances/shortest paths for all tiles, but that doesn't take into account collaborative movement (it assumes ants don't block each other)
2011-12-01T14:00:07  <lbeew> still nice
2011-12-01T14:00:40  <g0llum> yea the mleitung factor
2011-12-01T14:01:10  <lbeew> i've implemented an A* algorithm, but it's so time consuming, also not sure how to save the paths
2011-12-01T14:01:27  <thestinger> A* for each ant to each target was way to slow for me
2011-12-01T14:02:04  <Minthos> yeah I don't use a* either, just bfs
2011-12-01T14:02:11  <thestinger> even in C++ and somewhat optimized it was too slow for 300+ ants
2011-12-01T14:02:13  <lbeew> yes, it's very expensive so if i get more than 20 some ants it times out
2011-12-01T14:02:19  <thestinger> and it used way too much of my turn
2011-12-01T14:02:26  <g0llum> i find it hard to squeese 40 ants through a gap 3 tiles wide.. any i deas on that ?
2011-12-01T14:03:03  <thestinger> g0llum: what will your ants do?
2011-12-01T14:03:18  <g0llum> good question
2011-12-01T14:03:42  <thestinger> mine will fill the whole pathway, and they can swap places with each other
2011-12-01T14:03:54  <thestinger> so they'll get through it in a fairly efficient manner
2011-12-01T14:04:06  <g0llum> guess, if isolve that, former question is solved

2011-12-01T14:45:56  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=151363&user=757 two interesting things in this game
2011-12-01T14:46:12  <Fluxid> one is that i don't gather food in cave just right by my hive
2011-12-01T14:46:22  <Fluxid> i don't keep area visible at all, wtf
2011-12-01T14:46:40  <Fluxid> and second, right before flag timeout, you can see him stutter
2011-12-01T14:48:28  <Minthos> maybe his combat code is too expensive for official server
2011-12-01T14:48:52  <Fluxid> still, i saw him manage with at least 300 ants
2011-12-01T14:49:01  <Fluxid> but here he has got only 164
2011-12-01T14:49:22  <Fluxid> he even pauses for few turns
2011-12-01T14:49:44  <Fluxid> or move only few of his ants
2011-12-01T14:50:07  <Minthos> pause could be a sign of starvation, his bot detects timeout is imminent and aborts everything
2011-12-01T14:50:29  <Fluxid> i know that, i just wonder what could go wrong if not combat
2011-12-01T14:50:49  <Fluxid> he doesn't even have many enemy ants to deal with
2011-12-01T14:51:29  <Fluxid> anyway i like this map. looks like intestine, and has those funny caves
2011-12-01T14:52:05  <Fluxid> yeah, my bot is completely broken on server
2011-12-01T14:52:15  <Fluxid> i wonder how it managed to up to 16th place

2011-12-01T15:50:51  <BenJackson> Fluxid: my version 7 wandered from 16-22nd place and my new version is clearly better
2011-12-01T15:51:02  <BenJackson> but I don't know that the game rate on the server would have ever pushed the old one down if I didn't resubmit
2011-12-01T15:51:18  <BenJackson> I think they algorithm they're using just won't converge for such small game rates
2011-12-01T15:51:49  <BenJackson> I have no idea how they're going to make the "finals" work
2011-12-01T15:52:01  <BenJackson> they don't have nearly enough compute horsepower
2011-12-01T15:52:09  <thestinger> my bot is prepared if turntime gets cut down to 50ms :)
2011-12-01T15:52:40  <BenJackson> switching to CPU time instead of wall time would help a lot
2011-12-01T15:52:58  <BenJackson> you could run multiple matches on one instance and soak up all the CPU
2011-12-01T15:54:01  <rwest> 50ms would be brutal
2011-12-01T15:54:15  <BenJackson> 50ms would be a whole new contest
2011-12-01T15:54:20  <rwest> seriously
2011-12-01T15:54:43  <rwest> I def wouldn't be using java haha
2011-12-01T15:55:44  <Minthos> 50 ms locally for me isn't the same as 50 ms on the server

2011-12-01T16:49:30  <rwest> haha
2011-12-01T16:50:31  <BenJackson> did something similarly suicidal on aichallenge too
2011-12-01T16:50:45  <BenJackson> I'm saving games like that using the extra args:  http://tcpants.com/replay.14283?turn=696&col=25&row=60
2011-12-01T16:50:50  <BenJackson> putting them in my todo list
2011-12-01T16:51:45  <rwest> I need to implement standing still as an valid move hah
2011-12-01T16:51:55  <rwest> I think that may help a lot
2011-12-01T16:52:30  <rwest> I see there are times when I am completely blocked and I just step on my own ants
2011-12-01T16:52:59  <rwest> rare, but if I can't move in any direction and there is an ant north, squish
2011-12-01T16:55:53  <BenJackson> I extended everything to consider move=4 to be still
2011-12-01T16:56:08  <BenJackson> for a while I was even ordering ants to go "x" to the server, oops
2011-12-01T16:58:09  <rwest> I can just move my movement into my map class and just not move if all possible moves are -100000 weighted (my score given to occupied, water or soon to be occupied tiles)
2011-12-01T16:58:32  <rwest> I have a feeling there are a lot of times that not moving is my best move

2011-12-01T17:18:13  <thestinger> well I mean my _hill_ dies
2011-12-01T17:19:09  <BenJackson> McLeopold: Based on game analysis or some static quality of that map?
2011-12-01T17:19:35  <BenJackson> I assume the latter
2011-12-01T17:22:31  <thestinger> BenJackson: I guess because all starting positions are identical
2011-12-01T17:27:44  <Zannick> haha, fantastic
2011-12-01T17:40:15  <BenJackson> argh, in my one aichallenge game today one of my neighbors suicided into my hill
2011-12-01T17:40:22  <BenJackson> this is sooo informative
2011-12-01T17:42:47  <BenJackson> I wonder if that's a viable strategy overall
2011-12-01T17:43:01  <BenJackson> only goal being to trade your 1 point hills for 2 point hill caps
2011-12-01T17:43:03  <jstrong> random walks are teh useless

2011-12-01T17:43:17  <thestinger> BenJackson: suiciding into hills? that's a perfectly valid tactic :)
2011-12-01T17:43:39  <thestinger> I should run my old bot without combat on tcp again
2011-12-01T17:43:50  <BenJackson> thestinger: in this case by "suicide" I mean he abandoned his hill and sent all his ants to mine
2011-12-01T17:44:01  <thestinger> ah, I still do that
2011-12-01T17:44:01  <BenJackson> lost his hill about the same time he took mine
2011-12-01T17:44:04  <thestinger> but I don't stop foraging
2011-12-01T17:44:44  <thestinger> meh, this territory control stuff isn't working at all
2011-12-01T17:44:50  <BenJackson> I try to learn things from these games, but so many things are outside your control
2011-12-01T17:45:00  <BenJackson> one ant happens to only go one way so his neighbor expands twice as fast

2011-12-01T21:36:34  <McLeopold> good enough to replace all of the ec2 instances?
2011-12-01T21:36:34  <bugnuts> ThiagoRRamos you almost certainly want to turn off almost all of your logging before you upload to the server.

2011-12-01T21:37:29  <janzert> I was wondering what your thoughts on that are
2011-12-01T21:38:19  <janzert> all the bots in each game would be running on the same hardware obviously but some games would be getting better hardware than others
2011-12-01T21:38:39  <ThiagoRRamos> bugnuts: Actually I can't use the log :P
2011-12-01T21:38:42  <janzert> of course ec2 doesn't guarantee that all instances are exactly the same either
2011-12-01T21:39:11  <ThiagoRRamos> bugnuts:This 10MB data limit just refers to the loggings?
2011-12-01T21:39:16  <McLeopold> idk...
2011-12-01T21:39:38  <janzert> McLeopold: also it's still pretty tentative on whether we can get it worked out to use at all

2011-12-01T21:40:59  <McLeopold> I think I'm okay with it before finals
2011-12-01T21:41:10  <bugnuts> not necessarily logging but writing anything is a mistake I think
2011-12-01T21:41:39  <bugnuts> beyond the required commands to stout that is
2011-12-01T21:41:55  <ThiagoRRamos> hmm
2011-12-01T21:42:18  <ThiagoRRamos> so this limit is actually the stdout?
2011-12-01T21:42:36  <bugnuts> there is no limit on stdout.
2011-12-01T21:42:53  <McLeopold> ThiagoRRamos: the 10mb limit is on writing files, not stdout or stderr
2011-12-01T21:43:09  <McLeopold> There should be no good reason to create files
2011-12-01T21:43:23  <ThiagoRRamos> Hmm
2011-12-01T21:43:32  <bugnuts> I think thats right.  it's a limit on things which turn up in the filesystem
2011-12-01T21:43:49  <ThiagoRRamos> Hmm
2011-12-01T21:43:55  <bugnuts> Hmm?
2011-12-01T21:43:58  <ThiagoRRamos> I think I understood now
2011-12-01T21:44:07  <janzert> yes, the 10MB limit is meant for things that actually end up on the disk
2011-12-01T21:44:08  <ThiagoRRamos> It's that my bot timed out recently on a server game
2011-12-01T21:44:27  <ThiagoRRamos> And this time I really couldn't find out a good time reason
2011-12-01T21:45:25  <ThiagoRRamos> So I thought there sould be something wrong about this limit
2011-12-01T21:45:38  <ThiagoRRamos> but actually I couldn't use a log yet...
2011-12-01T21:46:00  <Antimony> I find it amusing how a signle ant of mine just ate a complete trail of food all around the center of the map. http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=152688&user=3845&turn=219
2011-12-01T21:46:08  <McLeopold> unless  you need multiple files, I'd just write to stderr

2011-12-01T21:47:39  <ThiagoRRamos> I could write to stdout
2011-12-01T21:47:54  <ThiagoRRamos> so the engine would say there was an error en would print my message
2011-12-01T21:48:03  <ThiagoRRamos> but it isn't very good

2011-12-01T22:12:20  <amstan> it would have been me, jeff and jbroman as the 3 directors
2011-12-01T22:12:33  <janzert> what happened to you and jbroman?
2011-12-01T22:12:33  <amstan> but i think jbroman didn't want to do it because his affiliation with Google
2011-12-01T22:13:00  <amstan> but i think you need at least 3 directors

2011-12-01T22:20:02  <BenJackson> good q for janzert and amstan
2011-12-01T22:20:07  <BenJackson> probably just drop in the java package
2011-12-01T22:20:27  <bmh> I've got a bot to write :)
2011-12-01T22:20:35  <janzert> I really don't know anything about how the tcp server is setup to do ranking or matchmaking
2011-12-01T22:20:49  <bmh> matchmaking is first come - first serve
