2011-01-26T20:54:39  <amstan> so.. it is a mod, lol
2011-01-26T20:55:03  <Prillicy> it doesn't follow phpbb standards, not that that's necessarily a good thing
2011-01-26T20:55:17  <Prillicy> I tried their anti-spammer mods which were huge and didn't work

2011-01-26T20:57:03  <amstan> that's been my policy.. just delete their accounts, no reason to keep them
2011-01-26T20:57:13  <amstan> so.. how much do i have to edit, how many new files?
2011-01-26T20:57:15  *** delt0r_ <delt0r_!~delt0r@188-22-172-52.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-01-26T20:57:18  <Prillicy> if you don't want to ban, that's fine
2011-01-26T20:57:18  <amstan> like.. do you have a github of this?
2011-01-26T20:57:19  <Prillicy> no new files
2011-01-26T20:57:31  <Prillicy> you open up one file
2011-01-26T20:57:33  <Prillicy> and find a line
2011-01-26T20:57:40  <Prillicy> and right before it, you paste this
2011-01-26T20:57:43  *** greghaynes <greghaynes!~irc@2607:f2f8:a490::2> has joined #aichallenge
2011-01-26T20:57:43  <Prillicy> then you're done
2011-01-26T20:57:47  <Prillicy> save and close
2011-01-26T20:57:47  <amstan> ok.. decent
2011-01-26T20:58:03  <amstan> can i have some documentation about this?
2011-01-26T20:58:06  <Prillicy> I'm a profenssional developer
2011-01-26T20:58:24  <Prillicy> what docs do you want?
2011-01-26T20:59:05  <amstan> Prillicy: well.. some more docs about your mod.. like. the actual diff
2011-01-26T20:59:09  <amstan> and where to put it
2011-01-26T20:59:25  <amstan> and i want it somewhere permanent, so i can do this again in case i update and replace the files
2011-01-26T20:59:31  <Prillicy> sure, how do you want me to send it to you? pm?
2011-01-26T20:59:31  <amstan> i do not trust that update method phpbb has
2011-01-26T20:59:41  <amstan> yeah, or like.. gist.github.org
2011-01-26T20:59:44  <amstan> and tell contestbot about it
2011-01-26T20:59:54  <Prillicy> I could pastebin it?
2011-01-26T21:00:33  <amstan> sure, but how long will that stay there?
2011-01-26T21:00:59  <Prillicy> I could make it permanent, but I'm not a fan of permanent pastebins
2011-01-26T21:01:18  <amstan> that's why i suggested github, they're pretty permanent, but you can also delete them
2011-01-26T21:01:36  <Prillicy> I've never been to github except from a link at your site tbh
2011-01-26T21:01:52  <amstan> ok.. nvm
2011-01-26T21:01:58  <amstan> just pastebin it, keep it permanent though
2011-01-26T21:01:59  <Prillicy> I like pastebin because it can show the difference
2011-01-26T21:02:02  <Prillicy> k
2011-01-26T21:02:17  <amstan> gists are git repos, you can actually clone them and see all the diffs of all the ppl who made them
2011-01-26T21:02:19  <amstan> and when
2011-01-26T21:02:21  <amstan> and so on
2011-01-26T21:02:26  <Prillicy> hmm
2011-01-26T21:02:35  <Prillicy> I'll look into github
2011-01-26T21:08:50  <Prillicy> I have an auto-block on chinese and russian emails in here, do you want me to remove that for you?
2011-01-26T21:09:02  <Prillicy> .cn and .ru
2011-01-26T21:10:44  <janzert> seeing as russia is the country with the second most visits to the site that would probably be a good idea
2011-01-26T21:11:07  <Prillicy> I figured, just wanted to make sure, real people have a gmail
2011-01-26T21:14:54  <Prillicy> amstan: the code: http://pastebin.com/vAJkk2E8  the file it goes in is in your phpbb directory, in includes/ucp the file is called ucp_register.php
2011-01-26T21:15:19  <Prillicy> it goes before the line $message = $message . '<br /><br />' . sprintf($user->lang['RETURN_INDEX'], '<a href="' . append_sid("{$phpbb_root_path}index.$phpEx") . '">', '</a>');
2011-01-26T21:15:37  <Prillicy> the text of the whole file is here: http://pastebin.com/g63JPL3f
2011-01-26T21:15:44  <amstan> all the spammer has to do is to make their username something random
2011-01-26T21:15:46  <amstan> like..
2011-01-26T21:15:58  <amstan> "&ip=0.0.0.0"
2011-01-26T21:16:35  <Prillicy> believe me, it hasn't been stopped yet
2011-01-26T21:16:52  <Prillicy> but I could add a safe characters check
2011-01-26T21:17:04  *** chris__0076 is now known as chris_0076
2011-01-26T21:17:06  <Prillicy> seems unnecessary given the restrictions already in place on usernames & emails
2011-01-26T21:18:36  <amstan> ok, decent
2011-01-26T21:18:39  <amstan> how effective is it?
2011-01-26T21:19:47  <Prillicy> I've caught all but 1 so far, and that's because the 1 wasn't on stopforumspam yet, so I submitted him and deleted him
2011-01-26T21:19:55  <Prillicy> btw, if you're concerned, add this http://php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode.php
2011-01-26T21:20:41  <amstan> Prillicy: can you be more specific where it's supposed to be added? like. that line might change in future versions\
2011-01-26T21:20:50  <Prillicy> I'm doing that
2011-01-26T21:21:31  <amstan> https://gist.github.com/797936
2011-01-26T21:21:53  <amstan> @learn forumspam as https://gist.github.com/797936
2011-01-26T21:21:53  <contestbot> amstan: Aye, aye, sir
2011-01-26T21:23:48  <amstan> Prillicy: why is your change full of spaces when the phpbb source is tabs?
2011-01-26T21:24:21  <Prillicy> it's tabs
2011-01-26T21:24:25  <Prillicy> stupid pastebin
2011-01-26T21:24:49  <Prillicy> joined github for ya
2011-01-26T21:25:13  <Prillicy> that line may change, yes, but the premise is pretty basic.  call it after a user finishes registering
2011-01-26T21:25:30  <Prillicy> I put it there because some other spam protection script put their stuff there
2011-01-26T21:28:00  <Prillicy> did you get it set up?
2011-01-26T21:28:59  <amstan> Prillicy: yeah, wanna help me test?
2011-01-26T21:29:09  <amstan> just make a new user
2011-01-26T21:29:11  <amstan> i'll prune it..
2011-01-26T21:29:20  <Prillicy> ok
2011-01-26T21:30:53  <amstan> now who was that guy who didn't want his account deleted
2011-01-26T21:30:54  <amstan> lol
2011-01-26T21:31:46  <Prillicy> registered and activated
2011-01-26T21:32:02  <amstan> dr-, i don't see him
2011-01-26T21:32:20  <amstan> dr`away: ping...
2011-01-26T21:32:26  <amstan> dr`away: i'm not sure what forum account you have
2011-01-26T21:33:14  <Prillicy> you can delete my account now
2011-01-26T21:33:22  <amstan> yeah, i have a ton more to delete
2011-01-26T21:33:28  <amstan> i'll just delete all with 0 posts
2011-01-26T21:33:36  <Prillicy> heh
2011-01-26T21:33:41  <amstan> but dr is one that is shy and doesn't talk
2011-01-26T21:33:43  <Prillicy> by the way, you're welcome
2011-01-26T21:33:45  <Prillicy> ;)
2011-01-26T21:33:45  <amstan> so he has 0 as well
2011-01-26T21:33:50  <amstan> Prillicy: thanks
2011-01-26T21:34:03  <Prillicy> that's what we do.  Open source has to stick together
2011-01-26T21:34:08  <amstan> but i still have to see this working, i have been decieved before, lol
2011-01-26T21:34:18  <amstan> recaptcha has failed me
2011-01-26T21:34:24  <Prillicy> you won't see it working
2011-01-26T21:34:29  <Prillicy> it doesn't log users it gets rid of
2011-01-26T21:34:43  <Prillicy> my submissions to stopforumspam.com is how I track them
2011-01-26T21:34:56  <Prillicy> I have over a hundred, that's more users than my whole board
2011-01-26T21:35:21  <amstan> well..
2011-01-26T21:35:40  <amstan> as long as legit users can register and forum spammers can't(therefore no spam)
2011-01-26T21:35:43  <amstan> it's all good
2011-01-26T21:35:51  <Prillicy> I registered just fine
2011-01-26T21:35:52  <Prillicy> so legit can
2011-01-26T21:35:53  <amstan> Prillicy: can't an entry be added to the forum log actually?
2011-01-26T21:36:00  <amstan> when a spammer is found?
2011-01-26T21:36:09  <Prillicy> I don't know phpbb's logging mechanism
2011-01-26T21:36:16  <Prillicy> that could be added
2011-01-26T21:36:18  <amstan> dr`away: yeah.. so i'm deleting all accounts with 0 again
2011-01-26T21:36:26  <amstan> dr`away: i have no idea which one is yours, sorry
2011-01-26T21:36:29  <Prillicy> I just didn't...took me long enough to figure out user_ban and user_delete
2011-01-26T21:38:13  <amstan> Prillicy: would be a cool addition
2011-01-26T21:38:22  <amstan> Prillicy: this should be integrated into phpbb
2011-01-26T21:38:33  <Prillicy> I'll go ask on their channel what the function is
2011-01-26T21:39:11  <amstan> Prillicy: does your user exist anymore?
2011-01-26T21:39:46  <Prillicy> yup
2011-01-26T21:39:47  <Prillicy> all good
2011-01-26T21:39:57  <Prillicy> you deleted the new account
2011-01-26T21:40:02  <amstan> decent
2011-01-26T21:40:15  <amstan> forum finally reopened, thanks to you
2011-01-26T21:40:22  <amstan> well.. wasn't closed.. and it might be closed again
2011-01-26T21:41:30  <Prillicy> happy to help...actually surprised no one else did it, after all, we're all programmers here
2011-01-26T21:42:50  <amstan> it seems kinda inactive in here, we lack a good leader
2011-01-26T21:43:00  <amstan> so people are kinda losing interest
2011-01-26T21:43:09  <Prillicy> I can lead ;)
2011-01-26T21:43:18  <Prillicy> j/k
2011-01-26T21:43:44  <amstan> and it's sad too, such cool ideas
2011-01-26T21:44:02  <Prillicy> ?
2011-01-26T21:44:14  <amstan> oh.. any idea what happens if stopforumspam gets a false positive?
2011-01-26T21:44:29  <amstan> like.. the poor guy will get all his emails, ips and names marked as spam
2011-01-26T21:44:41  <amstan> unless he changes all of them at once
2011-01-26T21:45:36  <Prillicy> you can of course create his account for him in an absolute worst case
2011-01-26T21:45:47  <Prillicy> but users submit people to stopforumspam
2011-01-26T21:45:55  <Prillicy> I did myself by accident while testing
2011-01-26T21:46:10  <Prillicy> the way to fix it is to ask the user who submitted you to take you off his list
2011-01-26T21:46:15  <Prillicy> it's a quick delete button
2011-01-26T21:46:20  <Prillicy> and if it's real bad
2011-01-26T21:46:29  <Prillicy> you can ask stopforumspam's management to remove you
2011-01-26T21:46:53  <amstan> yeah, but.. hold on
2011-01-26T21:47:02  <amstan> @forumspam
2011-01-26T21:47:03  <contestbot> amstan: forumspam = https://gist.github.com/797936
2011-01-26T21:47:14  <amstan> Prillicy: oh.. right, i'm using your api key now
2011-01-26T21:47:37  <Prillicy> crap
2011-01-26T21:47:40  <Prillicy> get that off there
2011-01-26T21:47:45  <Prillicy> I commented it out in the pastebin
2011-01-26T21:47:47  <Prillicy> didn't I?
2011-01-26T21:47:50  * Prillicy mutters.
2011-01-26T21:47:59  <amstan> lol.. somehow i still have it
2011-01-26T21:48:00  <Prillicy> I'm going to have to change my api key
2011-01-26T21:48:03  <amstan> can you get yeah..
2011-01-26T21:48:23  <amstan> i can't really take it out, since it's a git repo, all revisions are still there
2011-01-26T21:50:13  <amstan> Prillicy: lol.. you put it in your comment too
2011-01-26T21:50:32  <Prillicy> crap crap crap
2011-01-26T21:50:42  <Prillicy> can you fix it please? I'm trying to figure out how to delete it
2011-01-26T21:50:59  <Prillicy> I commented it out in the pastebin and then reworked the thing to make it more organized
2011-01-26T21:51:00  <amstan> Prillicy: i could delete the gist, that'll work
2011-01-26T21:51:03  <Prillicy> and forgot to remove it
2011-01-26T21:51:07  <Prillicy> thanks
2011-01-26T21:51:14  <Prillicy> I'll give you a fresh copy
2011-01-26T21:51:20  <Prillicy> I'll post my first ever gist
2011-01-26T21:51:25  <amstan> ok
2011-01-26T21:51:31  <amstan> just copy mine.. and change it
2011-01-26T21:51:36  <amstan> i'll link contestbot to the new one
2011-01-26T21:51:43  <amstan> @forget forumspam
2011-01-26T21:51:43  <contestbot> amstan: OK
2011-01-26T21:53:55  <Prillicy> mine's not colorful
2011-01-26T21:55:07  <amstan> Prillicy: same.. make sure you have your filename with a .php in it
2011-01-26T21:55:14  <amstan> but like.. it should work
2011-01-26T21:55:21  <amstan> anyway.. how long did the key take to come?
2011-01-26T21:56:30  <Prillicy> https://gist.github.com/797970
2011-01-26T21:56:35  <Prillicy> it's instant
2011-01-26T21:56:42  <Prillicy> you just sign in and request a key and it's there
2011-01-26T21:56:48  <amstan> my email didn't come yet
2011-01-26T21:56:57  <Prillicy> go to the website
2011-01-26T21:56:59  <Prillicy> the key is there
2011-01-26T21:57:20  <amstan> Your API key has been emailed to alex@hypertriangle
2011-01-26T21:57:24  <amstan> and like.. it didn't
2011-01-26T21:57:41  <Prillicy> go to stopforumspam.com and go to userpanel api keys
2011-01-26T21:57:58  <amstan> i see
2011-01-26T21:58:00  <amstan> ok
2011-01-26T22:00:13  <Prillicy> working on logs atm
2011-01-26T22:02:05  <amstan> Prillicy: i guess you don'
2011-01-26T22:02:20  <amstan> don't need logs, i was underestimating the stuff at stopforumspam.com
2011-01-26T22:02:26  <amstan> i see it actually has a list
2011-01-26T22:02:28  <Prillicy> yeah, it's quite nice
2011-01-26T22:02:28  <amstan> that's all i wanted
2011-01-26T22:02:39  <Prillicy> and you can remove users that aren't spammers
2011-01-26T22:03:13  <amstan> yeah
2011-01-26T22:06:33  <Prillicy> have you caught someone already? is that why you know about the details
2011-01-26T22:09:25  <amstan> Prillicy: i'm just exploring..
2011-01-26T22:10:19  <Prillicy> no worries, you'll have your first catch by the morning
2011-01-26T22:11:06  <amstan> Prillicy: actually, i do have a catch!
2011-01-26T22:11:11  <Prillicy> hah!
2011-01-26T22:11:13  <Prillicy> nice
2011-01-26T22:11:14  <amstan> for some reason this feels like fishing
2011-01-26T22:11:15  <amstan> lol
2011-01-26T22:11:28  <amstan> 2!
2011-01-26T22:11:38  <amstan> 26-Jan-11 10:01 PM	77.70.41.8	hitBiadodak	krava@4livepromotions.com
2011-01-26T22:11:41  <Prillicy> cheers
2011-01-26T22:11:43  <amstan> 26-Jan-11 09:53 PM	84.19.188.43	Trequezet	doctortom@prokonto.pl
2011-01-26T22:12:34  <Prillicy> it's interesting, because the bots don't work all the time, so the users generally have to register manually, so catching them AFTER registration is just that much more cruel
2011-01-26T22:13:03  <amstan> yeah, it's quite fun
2011-01-26T22:13:30  <amstan> chris_0076: i also implemented it to cubicmatter.net
2011-01-26T22:13:59  <chris_0076> ?
2011-01-26T22:14:37  <amstan> chris_0076: anti spam system, contributed by Prillicy
2011-01-26T22:14:43  <chris_0076> oh ok
2011-01-26T22:15:00  <Prillicy> I'd love to see how they try to beat mine
2011-01-26T22:15:08  <Prillicy> much better than a captcha
2011-01-26T22:15:19  <amstan> Prillicy: they have lots of comps... they would do it
2011-01-26T22:15:35  <amstan> what do you think viruses do when they're bored.. lol.. spam forums
2011-01-26T22:15:42  <Prillicy> ;)
2011-01-26T22:15:58  <Prillicy> well, I do know the real reason they're hitting all these forums, and It's not what you think
2011-01-26T22:16:07  <amstan> hmm?
2011-01-26T22:16:24  <Prillicy> I checked my error logs and I never activated the smtp on my forums....so I found that was their goal
2011-01-26T22:16:33  <Prillicy> they're trying to send mass emails from the forums
2011-01-26T22:17:14  <amstan> oh man
2011-01-26T22:18:07  <amstan> Prillicy: also.. the stuff is already logged
2011-01-26T22:18:19  <amstan> check the admin log, all the bans show up
2011-01-26T22:18:25  <Prillicy> fair enough
2011-01-26T22:19:13  <amstan> so how can they abuse the email system, i don't get this
2011-01-26T22:19:25  <amstan> how can they send an email from the forums?
2011-01-26T22:21:44  <Prillicy> it comes from their email address, but your smtp server acts as a go-between and a layer of anonymity
2011-01-26T22:22:13  <Prillicy> much like a proxy
2011-01-26T22:22:24  <Prillicy> it can be tracked, but it's not easy.
2011-01-26T22:22:49  <amstan> i see
2011-01-26T22:22:51  <sigh> eh? the smtp would have to be an open relay, no?
2011-01-26T22:23:08  <amstan> sigh: the forums are pretty much relaying enough
2011-01-26T22:23:17  <Prillicy> apparently, adding a log entry is a huge deal
2011-01-26T22:23:33  <Prillicy> not worth the headache to my users, let alone to me
2011-01-26T22:23:37  <sigh> hmmm
2011-01-26T22:23:49  <Prillicy> like you said, it already logs the ban
