2012-03-02T12:48:41  <antimatroid> yeah my arms have no muscle aha
2012-03-02T12:48:49  <antimatroid> i think my legs aren't too bad from riding most places
2012-03-02T12:50:20  <mcstar> ive always been quite strong, as far as someone who never exercised can be, and could beat guys who did it regulary, so i never was motivated enough
2012-03-02T12:50:52  <mcstar> but i like running, i did it again yesterday, cause i need to have some stamina
2012-03-02T12:50:58  <mcstar> thats an entirely different story
2012-03-02T12:51:27  <mcstar> you cant gain cardiovascular strength with eating proteins and bench-pushing
2012-03-02T12:53:07  <mcstar> at one point i tried tai-chi training though
2012-03-02T12:53:17  <mcstar> i downloaded some tutorial dvd's
2012-03-02T12:53:57  <mcstar> (it wasnt bad at all, ill try to do it again sometime)
2012-03-02T12:54:09  <a1k0n> lawyer up and hit the gym
2012-03-02T12:54:20  <mcstar> no
2012-03-02T12:54:48  <mcstar> when i got into uni, i went to the gym with some guy in the hostel
2012-03-02T12:54:54  <mcstar> i found it entirely boring
2012-03-02T12:57:10  <mcstar> probably all the people i met and were visiting the gym regularly, they wanted to gain weight
2012-03-02T12:57:15  <mcstar> i mean how stupid is that?
2012-03-02T12:57:58  <mcstar> if anything, i want to lose weight
2012-03-02T12:58:09  <mcstar> i just want to run...
2012-03-02T12:58:54  <mcstar> (my left ankle was broken and so it limits the amount of running i can do in a copule of days' time)

2012-03-02T13:21:15  <mcstar> which is it?

2012-03-02T13:22:28  <mcstar> i dont think any of my courses have started yet
2012-03-02T13:22:36  <thestinger> so far he's taught localization with histograms and kalman filters
2012-03-02T13:22:47  <thestinger> but I had to go elsewhere to actually learn most of the interesting stuff
2012-03-02T13:23:03  <thestinger> most of it was review of basic probability and linear algebra
2012-03-02T13:23:09  <mcstar> hm, thats pretty advanced on the first week
2012-03-02T13:23:29  <thestinger> mcstar: he didn't really go very far into depth though, at all
2012-03-02T13:23:36  <thestinger> kalman filters was the 2nd week (this week)
2012-03-02T13:23:53  <thestinger> mcstar: for example he made us a matrix class, and gave us the equation
2012-03-02T13:24:03  <thestinger> just had to convert the math markup -> python basically
2012-03-02T13:24:32  <mcstar> lol, i had to convert a bit of python to c++
2012-03-02T13:24:35  <thestinger> and then the homework was to do it for higher dimensions (had to come up the the matrices)
2012-03-02T13:24:40  <mcstar> from the matplotlib sources
2012-03-02T13:24:42  <thestinger> with the*
2012-03-02T13:25:04  <mcstar> ic
2012-03-02T13:25:40  <thestinger> the unit 2 homework was basically just math, no coding
2012-03-02T13:25:46  <mcstar> the guy who wrote the python code did some modulo magic, which i just simplified to a floor :)
2012-03-02T13:25:57  <thestinger> the "programming" exercise was plugging in the values for the matrices :P
2012-03-02T13:26:11  <thestinger> the unit 1 hw was harder
2012-03-02T13:26:36  <thestinger> had to make the histogram localization (which he taught only in 1D) work for 2D
2012-03-02T13:26:44  <thestinger> still not very hard, but at least we had to program something
2012-03-02T13:27:21  <thestinger> I think they'll probably make the next courses a lot more challenging
2012-03-02T13:27:33  <mcstar> what do you use for plotting?
2012-03-02T13:27:41  <thestinger> atm it feels like they are teaching too much stuff at once, so they can't really get into depth
2012-03-02T13:28:08  <thestinger> mcstar: matplotlib is nice since it's part of the whole scipy/numpy distribution
2012-03-02T13:28:16  <thestinger> but it has a pretty awful API imo
2012-03-02T13:28:38  <thestinger> I haven't really tried anything else
2012-03-02T13:29:14  <mcstar> afaik its the best for python
2012-03-02T13:29:42  <mcstar> probably not the best choice if you need real time plotting on huge data sets
2012-03-02T13:30:11  <mcstar> thestinger: im writing atm a scatter plot in qt
2012-03-02T13:33:20  <thestinger> cs373 seems to be mostly about teaching python atm, which is why I'm not really finding it interesting
2012-03-02T13:34:24  <thestinger> mcstar: does Qt have anything for that built-in? or you're just drawing on something like a canvas
2012-03-02T13:35:11  <mcstar> well, i tried a QGraphicsScene/QGraphicsView which lets you put objects into 'real space'
2012-03-02T13:35:17  <mcstar> and lets you interact with them
2012-03-02T13:35:31  <mcstar> but i found it eventually to be not suitable
2012-03-02T13:35:43  <mcstar> so im now just painting on a regular surface
2012-03-02T13:36:25  <mcstar> i want to have zoom, and pan, and axis labels/ticks
2012-03-02T13:37:06  <mcstar> qt doesnt even provide you with writing rotated text!
2012-03-02T13:37:16  <mcstar> (like aligned rotated text)
2012-03-02T13:38:38  <mcstar> thestinger: and im using boost.asio for serial communication
2012-03-02T13:38:58  <thestinger> ugh, async :P
2012-03-02T13:39:08  <mcstar> its not bad, couple of lines
2012-03-02T13:39:30  <thestinger> yeah, I guess it only gets bad when your whole application is just event-based
2012-03-02T13:39:34  <mcstar> 9 found some example code to start from, i kept what i needed
2012-03-02T13:39:48  <mcstar> 9->i
2012-03-02T13:39:59  <thestinger> I got really turned off from it by twisted and node.js, compared to Go and stackless python
2012-03-02T13:40:19  <mcstar> from what?
2012-03-02T13:40:32  <mcstar> event-based systems?
2012-03-02T13:40:34  <thestinger> async/event-based programming
2012-03-02T13:40:35  <thestinger> yeah
2012-03-02T13:40:49  <thestinger> I've been fully convinced by the lightweight thread people that it's crap
2012-03-02T13:40:59  <mcstar> qt is nice as long as you have 1 gui thread

2012-03-02T13:41:37  <mcstar> the io is run on a different thread, so this doesnt affect the gui
2012-03-02T13:41:43  <mcstar> well, not entirely
2012-03-02T13:41:52  <mcstar> cause i will send signals from that thread to the gui
2012-03-02T13:42:16  <mcstar> when a widget needs updating, cause new data has arrived..

2012-03-02T14:34:33  <mcstar> hehe
2012-03-02T14:34:41  <mcstar> i hope it hurt
2012-03-02T14:35:03  <mcstar> i remember for a course i had to build a gui for a problem in matlab
2012-03-02T14:35:26  <mcstar> something like solving an ode, i dont remember
2012-03-02T14:37:25  <mcstar> whoa, im segfaulting when copying a vector

2012-03-02T14:42:19  <mcstar> lol
2012-03-02T14:42:33  <thestinger> dunno :P
2012-03-02T14:42:33  <mcstar> i have to .reserve before the copying!
2012-03-02T14:42:49  <thestinger> probably a bug elsewhere
2012-03-02T14:42:52  <mcstar> copy seems to use memcpy directly
2012-03-02T14:43:00  <mcstar> not by iterating over
2012-03-02T14:45:29  <thestinger> maybe valgrind can find the bug
2012-03-02T14:46:03  <mcstar> i can copy to a vector, form another, but first i have to to.reserve(from.size()) its size
2012-03-02T14:46:12  <mcstar> but after the copy took place, its size remains 0
2012-03-02T14:46:31  <thestinger> what's the size and capacity of it?
2012-03-02T14:47:13  <mcstar> aham
2012-03-02T14:47:19  <mcstar> i have to call .resize()

2012-03-02T15:01:24  <mcstar> thestinger: im looking at shades of white for a nice background color for the plot, but on my lcd most of them look the same!
2012-03-02T15:01:40  <mcstar> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Shades_of_white
2012-03-02T15:02:01  <mcstar> omg
2012-03-02T15:02:05  <mcstar> what a huge difference
2012-03-02T15:02:14  <mcstar> on the crt they all look different
2012-03-02T15:03:18  <thestinger> heh, most look the same for me
2012-03-02T15:03:26  <thestinger> well
2012-03-02T15:03:35  <thestinger> I can tell the difference between them all, but not without looking closely
2012-03-02T15:03:42  <rwest> all different to me
2012-03-02T15:03:47  <rwest> and I am partially colorblind
2012-03-02T15:03:50  <mcstar> ok, i changed the contrast, lowered it and its a bit better
2012-03-02T15:03:55  <thestinger> mcstar: put your lcd screen at an angle
2012-03-02T15:04:10  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-03-02T15:04:18  <thestinger> lean it backwards
2012-03-02T15:04:26  <thestinger> like move the top backwards with the bottom staying in the same place
2012-03-02T15:04:36  <thestinger> makes it darker
2012-03-02T15:04:49  <mcstar> that doesnt matter
2012-03-02T15:04:57  <thestinger> the brightness bleeds out all the color if you just have the regular backlights
2012-03-02T15:05:03  <mcstar> what i noticed that at a particular contrast, the colors come back
2012-03-02T15:05:09  <mcstar> and a bit higher, they disappear
2012-03-02T15:05:30  <mcstar> this is an old viewsonic
2012-03-02T15:05:38  <mcstar> the edges are burnt out thats for sure
2012-03-02T15:08:14  <mcstar> eggshell looks nice, im going with that
