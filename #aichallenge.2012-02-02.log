2012-02-02T09:44:41  <mcstar> tv said yesterday that 40 people died in ukraine since this cold weather started
2012-02-02T09:47:59  <mcstar> what a smoldering conversation
2012-02-02T09:48:04  <UncleVasya> 'The day after tomorrow' happened in Ukraine :)
2012-02-02T09:48:05  <mcstar> heated arguments pro and con
2012-02-02T09:48:47  <UncleVasya> -25 in my town. Cold for me, but not a really big deal I think.
2012-02-02T09:49:09  <mcstar> thats cooold
2012-02-02T09:49:13  <UncleVasya> My uni is closed until monday because of that.

2012-02-02T09:50:56  <mcstar> amstan: yes, still i can produce an incredible amount of unitelligible jokes
2012-02-02T09:51:02  <mcstar> n*
2012-02-02T09:54:30  <mcstar> couple days ago i got to know, that the wachowski brothers are dead
2012-02-02T09:54:45  <mcstar> ruined my whole day
2012-02-02T09:55:38  <mcstar> so, i dont know if you guys know it, but larry became lana
2012-02-02T09:55:44  <rwest> mcstar: meanwhile, in the US, we have had near no snow in the northeast
2012-02-02T09:55:55  <rwest> easiest winter I can remember
2012-02-02T09:56:12  <mcstar> same here, until now
2012-02-02T09:56:45  <mcstar> i remember seening north america in the news, coverd in big foff snow
2012-02-02T09:56:45  <rwest> it was 55 out yesterday
2012-02-02T09:56:54  <mcstar> in every year
2012-02-02T09:57:10  <mcstar> rwest: thats fahrenheit right?
2012-02-02T09:57:19  <rwest> we had a snow storm in oct that took out my power for 4 days
2012-02-02T09:57:21  <rwest> yea F
2012-02-02T09:57:33  <rwest> we don't believe in sensible systems in the US
2012-02-02T09:57:41  <mcstar> 100F is fever, thats all i know
2012-02-02T09:57:58  <rwest> 100C == 212F
2012-02-02T09:58:03  <pairofdice> oh, it's -20c here
2012-02-02T09:58:04  <rwest> 0C == 32F
2012-02-02T09:58:43  <pairofdice> Turns out parks and rec is hilarious
2012-02-02T09:58:51  <mcstar> i watched them all
2012-02-02T09:58:54  <mcstar> in 2 days
2012-02-02T09:59:23  <mcstar> its pretty good, i really like ron swanson
2012-02-02T09:59:43  <rwest> I have never heard of that show
2012-02-02T09:59:56  <mcstar> we were discussing it here
2012-02-02T10:00:00  <mcstar> a week ago?
2012-02-02T10:00:16  <rwest> I usually only irc at work
2012-02-02T10:00:25  <rwest> haven't really at this new job until this week
2012-02-02T10:01:58  <mcstar> so anyway, back to the wachowski's
2012-02-02T10:02:20  <rwest> the who?
2012-02-02T10:02:23  <mcstar> i dont understand, how come matrix is soo good, and all their other movies are average
2012-02-02T10:02:32  <rwest> oh those guys
2012-02-02T10:02:33  <mcstar> or below average
2012-02-02T10:02:34  <pairofdice> Just started 4th season
2012-02-02T10:02:48  <mcstar> i watched v for vendetta, big disappointment
2012-02-02T10:05:15  <mcstar> pairofdice: andy is very funny in a stupid way
2012-02-02T10:05:27  <pairofdice> Andy reminds me of me
2012-02-02T10:05:43  <mcstar> in what way?
2012-02-02T10:05:49  <mcstar> he is really stupid
2012-02-02T10:06:07  <mcstar> and naive
2012-02-02T10:06:13  <pairofdice> Yeah
2012-02-02T10:06:43  <mcstar> he reminds me of a schoolmate of mine from high school
2012-02-02T10:07:27  <UncleVasya> mcstar: I like 'V for Vendetta'. Maybe because it has a very good poetic Russian translation.
2012-02-02T10:07:45  <UncleVasya> And don't like Matrix :p
2012-02-02T10:07:54  <mcstar> oh
2012-02-02T10:08:04  <mcstar> this hurts
2012-02-02T10:08:58  <mcstar> i found vforvendetta very shallow, and miss portman was quite weak
2012-02-02T10:09:06  <mcstar> so was stephen rea
2012-02-02T10:09:55  <mcstar> weaving was good, (i didnt understand his poetry though, i need a wider vocabulary for that)
2012-02-02T10:11:41  <mcstar> oh
2012-02-02T10:12:12  <mcstar> i found it funny, that john hurt played the role of the chancellor, because he was the protagonist in 1984
2012-02-02T10:17:29  <amstan> oh yes! new nightwish!
2012-02-02T10:18:59  <mcstar> ...album?
2012-02-02T10:19:16  <amstan> yes
2012-02-02T10:19:33  <mcstar> oh, i listened to some machinae supremacy
2012-02-02T10:19:36  <amstan> they didn't deviate from their style
2012-02-02T10:19:43  <rwest> hmmm I vaguely remember listening to them
2012-02-02T10:19:53  <mcstar> amstan: you like them right?
2012-02-02T10:20:02  <amstan> rwest: who machinae supremacy or nightwish?
2012-02-02T10:20:02  * rwest opens spotify
2012-02-02T10:20:06  <amstan> mcstar: yeah
2012-02-02T10:20:06  <rwest> nightwish
2012-02-02T10:20:07  <mcstar> unfortunately they didnt appeal to me
2012-02-02T10:20:20  <amstan> mcstar: most songs suck though
2012-02-02T10:20:28  <amstan> mcstar: the nice ones are the site releases
2012-02-02T10:20:51  <amstan> mcstar: like the sidologies
2012-02-02T10:20:57  <amstan> mcstar: great giana sisters
2012-02-02T10:21:03  <amstan> mcstar: and there's another cool song: machinae prime
2012-02-02T10:21:28  <mcstar> lets hear it
2012-02-02T10:22:06  <amstan> mcstar: they're all instrumentals
2012-02-02T10:22:27  <rwest> amstan: I was confused a bit when I listened to the first song, I was like... umm male singer?
2012-02-02T10:22:50  <amstan> rwest: nightwish? yeah, they have a bunch of those
2012-02-02T10:23:18  <amstan> oh yes.. another 12 minute song
2012-02-02T10:23:20  <amstan> i love those
2012-02-02T10:23:28  <amstan> near the end of it though
2012-02-02T10:23:34  <amstan> so that's another 40 minutes
2012-02-02T10:23:39  <amstan> i just started it
2012-02-02T10:24:07  <rwest> I love spotify, no more having to bother torrenting music
2012-02-02T10:24:15  <amstan> rwest: how so?
2012-02-02T10:24:31  <rwest> spotify has pretty much everything I need
2012-02-02T10:24:39  <amstan> rwest: is it like a solid fee?
2012-02-02T10:24:54  <rwest> I pay $10/mth for the highest package
2012-02-02T10:25:02  <rwest> that includes mobile and linux preview
2012-02-02T10:25:02  <amstan> decent
2012-02-02T10:25:16  <rwest> there is a $5 one if you only use windows and mac
2012-02-02T10:25:23  <amstan> but can i download songs from it and put them on my tablet to listen without internet?
2012-02-02T10:25:36  <amstan> rwest: clementine seems to have a plugin for it
2012-02-02T10:25:41  <rwest> yes you can
2012-02-02T10:25:44  <mcstar> and rwest gots a 100$ bonus, if you refer him when you join
2012-02-02T10:25:46  <mcstar> e*
2012-02-02T10:25:51  <rwest> you can set playlists to "listen offline"
2012-02-02T10:26:03  <rwest> mcstar: I do? lol
2012-02-02T10:26:13  <mcstar> i have no idea...
2012-02-02T10:26:15  <amstan> rwest: can you check if it has dbsoundworks in there? he made the supermeatboy soundtrack
2012-02-02T10:26:31  <amstan> rwest: or machinae supremacy
2012-02-02T10:26:39  <amstan> rwest: like.. i don't think i can find everything i like in there
2012-02-02T10:26:56  <rwest> machinae supremacy is there
2012-02-02T10:27:03  <rwest> dbsoundworks I don't see
2012-02-02T10:27:45  <rwest> there is a free level with ads you can check out
2012-02-02T10:27:49  <amstan> rwest: ok
2012-02-02T10:28:45  <rwest> I find that it has most of what I listen to

2012-02-02T10:36:03  <mcstar> i run out of memory
2012-02-02T10:36:17  <mcstar> seems i can break almost anything
2012-02-02T10:36:21  <rwest> amstan: you guys decide on the next challenge yet?
2012-02-02T10:37:03  <rwest> mcstar: I found the best way to do project euler problems
2012-02-02T10:37:35  <rwest> I made a cluster of 8 core machins on HP cloud services, brute force takes under 60s, that counts right?
2012-02-02T10:39:39  <mcstar> which problem?
2012-02-02T10:39:56  <rwest> any of them really haha
2012-02-02T10:40:08  <mcstar> 1st?
2012-02-02T10:40:10  <rwest> I set up c with mpi over ssh tunnel
2012-02-02T10:40:39  <mcstar> i dont know what to say
2012-02-02T10:40:42  <rwest> lol
2012-02-02T10:40:55  <mcstar> i mean PE is not supposed to be abpout distributed computing
2012-02-02T10:41:12  <rwest> I have only used one problem as a test case
2012-02-02T10:41:26  <mcstar> but probably you can learn something from bruteforcing a couple of them
2012-02-02T10:41:27  <rwest> I have other things I am messing around with that I am using it for
2012-02-02T10:41:46  <mcstar> i dont like mpi
2012-02-02T10:41:48  <pairofdice> :D
2012-02-02T10:41:51  <rwest> well the work it takes to distribute them is a learning experience
2012-02-02T10:41:52  <pairofdice> gold
2012-02-02T10:42:08  <rwest> mcstar: the package I have supports ZPL too
2012-02-02T10:42:09  <amstan> rwest: that's the last part to do
2012-02-02T10:42:15  <amstan> rwest: first we have to rebuild the framework
2012-02-02T10:42:35  <rwest> as that was what my parallel programming class used
2012-02-02T10:42:46  <rwest> array language with the most horrible syntax
2012-02-02T10:43:04  <rwest> amstan is there split up work I could help with?
2012-02-02T10:43:42  <amstan> rwest: do you know django?
2012-02-02T10:44:02  <mcstar> im more interested in clojure's concurrency(however, thats not distributed yet) and in what haskell has to offer
2012-02-02T10:44:12  <rwest> amstan: nope, I am a php web dev heh
2012-02-02T10:45:05  <UncleVasya> hmm, maybe nowadays the experience you gain from creating such bruteforcing claster is more valuable than knowledge you gain from solving these problems fairly...
2012-02-02T10:45:45  <rwest> UncleVasya: a lot of the problems are more math than CS based
2012-02-02T10:46:00  <mcstar> all of them imho
2012-02-02T10:46:52  <rwest> I had a heavily math based program at my school, but I still miss the math tricks in a lot of the problems
2012-02-02T10:47:08  <UncleVasya> mcstar: Have you got a job?
2012-02-02T10:47:30  <mcstar> the 2 kinds of knowledge/experience is very orthogonal to each other, and im inclined to say that the math side is mroe important, but ofc the computing side is more practical
2012-02-02T10:47:53  <mcstar> UncleVasya: not yet
2012-02-02T10:47:56  <rwest> I don't need the math side at all in almost any of my jobs I have had
2012-02-02T10:48:28  <mcstar> UncleVasya: next week im gonna have another interview
2012-02-02T10:48:46  <UncleVasya> gl & hf
2012-02-02T10:48:59  <mcstar> high five?
2012-02-02T10:49:34  <mcstar> ah have fun

2012-02-02T10:50:12  <mcstar> atm im trying out a FEM framework, i have an idea
2012-02-02T10:50:24  <UncleVasya> FEM?
2012-02-02T10:50:37  <mcstar> finite element method
2012-02-02T10:55:12  <mcstar> i hate when the tutorial is not working oob

2012-02-02T15:30:28  <mcstar> pairofdice: you always pay attention to capitalization, how come you dont close your sentences with the proper mark? i.e: .?!
2012-02-02T15:31:50  <pairofdice> . is a bit superfluous on IRC IMO TBH
2012-02-02T15:32:22  <pairofdice> Atleast with only one sentence per line
2012-02-02T15:32:54  <rwest> I like to speak in complete sentences; they are nice.
2012-02-02T15:33:04  <pairofdice> meh
2012-02-02T15:33:06  <mcstar> But you dont often do that, IMHO.
2012-02-02T15:33:16  <rwest> Judge my use of semicolon?
2012-02-02T15:33:38  <pairofdice> Judge complete sentences
2012-02-02T15:34:02  <mcstar> That semicolon didn't serve it's proper purpose, you still haven't learnt when to use it. Shame...

2012-02-02T15:34:47  <rwest> I think that was valid though
2012-02-02T15:36:12  <mcstar> that might be, i have no idea when to use it, i just wanted to write a well formed sentence
2012-02-02T15:36:29  <rwest> haha
2012-02-02T15:36:33  <pairofdice> Your capitalization is appalling
2012-02-02T15:36:43  <mcstar> rather, missing
2012-02-02T15:36:52  <rwest> it is supposed to be used to connect 2 complete sentences

2012-02-02T17:05:54  <mcstar> The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.
