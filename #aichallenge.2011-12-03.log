2011-12-03T00:00:05  <thestinger> it's fun when I get 17 warnings because gcc tried to inline a recursive function into itself...
2011-12-03T00:00:13  <a1k0n> e.g. you trade off a multiply instead of a pointer lookup
2011-12-03T00:00:41  <antimatroid> you forgot the syntax tradeoff :P
2011-12-03T00:01:01  <thestinger> not much worse imo since it takes the same number of characters
2011-12-03T00:01:13  <a1k0n> i'm holding a baby with hiccups so i can't type fast enough to explain myself right now
2011-12-03T00:01:24  <antimatroid> s'all good, i'm just going to overload ()
2011-12-03T00:04:09  <antimatroid> that just got WAY faster
2011-12-03T00:04:19  <antimatroid> changing matrix to be a 1d vector
2011-12-03T00:04:23  <thestinger> oh, nice
2011-12-03T00:04:27  <thestinger> I'll have to do that :)
2011-12-03T00:04:50  <thestinger> atm I'm making variable names shorter so these damn lines aren't so long
2011-12-03T00:04:59  <thestinger> I call enemies "axis" now
2011-12-03T00:05:02  <antimatroid> ehe, i just fixed a lot of that too
2011-12-03T00:05:04  <thestinger> and my ants are allies :)
2011-12-03T00:05:11  <antimatroid> i used to need boolMatrix[loc.row][loc.col]
2011-12-03T00:05:28  <antimatroid> i can do otherMatrix[loc] again now
2011-12-03T00:05:30  <a1k0n> right so you can have an operator[](row) which returns data+row*cols
2011-12-03T00:05:44  <a1k0n> and then [r][c] works
2011-12-03T00:07:03  <antimatroid> returns what?

2011-12-03T00:07:38  <bmh> thestinger, antimatroid: you should be using boosts bitset, not any crazy monkeypatched thing using vector<uint8_t>
2011-12-03T00:07:59  <bmh> a1k0n: I'm 100 pages into MacKay! :-D
2011-12-03T00:08:00  <a1k0n> template<class T> T* operator[](int row) { return data_ + row*cols_ }
2011-12-03T00:08:04  <a1k0n> heh nice
2011-12-03T00:08:11  <thestinger> bmh: well he wanted a bool vector, but without packing into bitfields
2011-12-03T00:08:44  <antimatroid> a1k0n: you don't need to redefine a template inside a struct that you already defined it for if that makes sense?
2011-12-03T00:08:46  <bmh> thestinger: why? for iterators?
2011-12-03T00:08:57  <antimatroid> ie. wouldn't the operator[] thing go inside the struct def?
2011-12-03T00:08:57  <a1k0n> i'm just putting it there for clarity, i know
2011-12-03T00:09:02  <antimatroid> ah okay :)
2011-12-03T00:09:22  <thestinger> bmh: bitfields make it _really_ slow
2011-12-03T00:09:29  <thestinger> for access/setting stuff

2011-12-03T00:12:42  <bmh> a1k0n has probably already suggested this, but you could use template meta-programming to generate a fixed size bit-field, complete with statically defined accessors/setters
2011-12-03T00:13:28  <bmh> template<int N> class Bitfield { uint32_t bf[N]; } // or something like that
2011-12-03T00:13:30  <BenJackson> std::bitset already does that
2011-12-03T00:13:41  <bmh> BenJackson: That's why I recommended it.

2011-12-03T00:14:32  <a1k0n> i should have done that instead of ants
2011-12-03T00:14:56  <a1k0n> gibbs sampling is actually the right solution there.  or viterbi
2011-12-03T00:14:59  <thestinger> did you see the mechanical turk solution? that was amusing
2011-12-03T00:15:05  <a1k0n> heh no
2011-12-03T00:15:15  <bmh> thestinger: that sounds prohibitively expensive
2011-12-03T00:15:19  <a1k0n> that was for the instagram challenge wasn't it?
2011-12-03T00:15:22  <thestinger> oh, yeah
2011-12-03T00:15:29  <a1k0n> which cost him $0.50
2011-12-03T00:15:33  <a1k0n> cuz its so easy
2011-12-03T00:17:27  <BenJackson> wow, KonaEarth was an ass on the forums
2011-12-03T00:17:35  <BenJackson> or did irc already cover that topic ;-)
2011-12-03T00:17:35  <bmh> link?
2011-12-03T00:17:41  <BenJackson> http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1989#p12387
2011-12-03T00:17:54  <thestinger> I gave him a polite RTFM response
2011-12-03T00:18:01  <thestinger> well "RTFM next time"
2011-12-03T00:18:20  <BenJackson> bmh: I happened to play with std::bitset the other day because someone on SO wanted access to the innards to "optimize" it
2011-12-03T00:18:38  <BenJackson> so I built his example "clean" code with g++ which made fast code perfectly
2011-12-03T00:19:08  <thestinger> BenJackson: btw, clang/llvm 3.0 were released :)
2011-12-03T00:19:19  <bmh> ha. BenJackson: I've been thinking of writing Qn.m fixed point math with template metaprogramming. Good idea, or bad idea?
2011-12-03T00:19:25  <thestinger> and I discovered there's a JIT compiler + REPL built on them, haven't tried it yet though
2011-12-03T00:19:34  <thestinger> http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cling
2011-12-03T00:19:56  <BenJackson> do you need metaprogramming?
2011-12-03T00:20:04  <BenJackson> I think a templatized fixed-point is a great idea
2011-12-03T00:20:20  <BenJackson> I've seen them before with various levels of completeness
2011-12-03T00:20:48  <BenJackson> I've implemented some half-baked ones when doing FPGA work where I wanted to simulate the math with the right bit widths
2011-12-03T00:21:00  <antimatroid> it actually hates me doing a matrix with uint8_t
2011-12-03T00:21:29  <bmh> I once implemented FP in Java. It was nasty.
2011-12-03T00:21:56  <thestinger> bmh: it's nearly sane in C++ now :)
2011-12-03T00:22:13  <antimatroid> thestinger: vector<uint8_t> test(10, 0); cout << test[0] << endl; that doesn't work for me :\
2011-12-03T00:22:17  <bmh> thestinger: The biggest issue I ran up against is that Java doesn't have unsigned types.
2011-12-03T00:22:20  <antimatroid> it just outputs as blank
2011-12-03T00:22:35  <thestinger> bmh: wait, what did you mean by FP?
2011-12-03T00:22:40  <thestinger> I interpreted that as functional programming
2011-12-03T00:22:45  <BenJackson> that's because uint8_t is a char
2011-12-03T00:22:52  <BenJackson> cout << char is printing it as a char
2011-12-03T00:22:53  <antimatroid> ohhhhhhh
2011-12-03T00:23:07  <BenJackson> pipe to cat -v you'll see ^@
2011-12-03T00:23:26  <BenJackson> thestinger: I assume he meant fixed point
2011-12-03T00:23:30  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T00:24:04  <thestinger> merging both topics: http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/java
2011-12-03T00:24:20  <thestinger> the "java is a DSL for turning XML into stack traces" quote is great
2011-12-03T00:24:58  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i don't get your index function :\
2011-12-03T00:25:01  <bmh> thestinger: fixed point
2011-12-03T00:25:12  <antimatroid> and it doesn't work..
2011-12-03T00:25:21  <BenJackson> antimatriod: index function?
2011-12-03T00:25:53  <bmh> thestinger: re: unsafePerformIO -- yeah... I can wrap Data.Vector in a homebrew Data.Vector.Debug and spew out all the args...
2011-12-03T00:25:55  <a1k0n> antimatroid: assuming you have a 1d array, it skips to a particular row and returns a pointer to the array at that point which you can then index again for the column
2011-12-03T00:26:03  <antimatroid> 1d vector
2011-12-03T00:26:18  * antimatroid changes to array
2011-12-03T00:26:27  <a1k0n> 1d vector is fine
2011-12-03T00:26:31  <a1k0n> same thing
2011-12-03T00:26:34  <BenJackson> oh I did the same thing in my grid class
2011-12-03T00:26:50  <BenJackson> so that the existing starter code of grid[r][c] would still work
2011-12-03T00:26:54  <a1k0n> i use operator()(row,col) but whatever
2011-12-03T00:27:26  <BenJackson> for some reason I did operator()(Location) too but didn't consider just doing [location]
2011-12-03T00:27:35  <bmh> my points contain the entire grid and execute safe traversals when you move them N/S/E/W
2011-12-03T00:28:17  <BenJackson> did everyone else move the various utility functions from State.cc to .h?
2011-12-03T00:28:17  <a1k0n> heh.  how vey haskell of you
2011-12-03T00:28:29  <a1k0n> i did somewhat
2011-12-03T00:28:47  <BenJackson> ChrisH was saying he cached huge amounts of stuff at start
2011-12-03T00:28:55  <thestinger> I wonder what lazy evaluation does with that
2011-12-03T00:29:01  <BenJackson> I'm wondering if that would pay off or if it would thrash the cache
2011-12-03T00:29:20  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i can't get it to work, would you be willing to glance at this? http://pastebin.com/2tn4KfMn there's a comment //here above the offending function
2011-12-03T00:29:49  <a1k0n> oh, right
2011-12-03T00:30:08  <a1k0n> return &matrix[rows*cols]
2011-12-03T00:30:11  <a1k0n> er
2011-12-03T00:30:16  <a1k0n> row
2011-12-03T00:30:31  <antimatroid> ah, i tried both of those but not together :P
2011-12-03T00:30:32  <antimatroid> my bad :P
2011-12-03T00:30:35  <a1k0n> i was assuming array, natch
2011-12-03T00:30:39  <antimatroid> i was rather confused :P
2011-12-03T00:30:40  <BenJackson> hm, does operator T* work on vector?
2011-12-03T00:30:54  <a1k0n> don't think so
2011-12-03T00:31:02  <a1k0n> though it would be easy to define
2011-12-03T00:31:19  <BenJackson> I don't see it in stl_vector
2011-12-03T00:32:08  <BenJackson> antimatriod: you could do matrix.data() + row*cols
2011-12-03T00:32:16  <antimatroid> i still don't see how this is going to work?
2011-12-03T00:32:18  <BenJackson> which is the spirit of what the original was
2011-12-03T00:32:37  <antimatroid> how does the indexing of the returned pointed work?
2011-12-03T00:33:01  <BenJackson> matrix[row] => pointer to T, [col] indexes within that pointer
2011-12-03T00:33:17  <BenJackson> like (matrix[row])[col] if that makes it clearer
2011-12-03T00:33:31  <antimatroid> derp
2011-12-03T00:33:37  <antimatroid> my other index functions are retarded :P
2011-12-03T00:33:53  <antimatroid> i was doing r + r.c instead of r.c + r
2011-12-03T00:33:57  <BenJackson> I would remove your unnecessary casting
2011-12-03T00:34:20  <BenJackson> you did it again :)
2011-12-03T00:34:24  <a1k0n> hhahah i don't think r+r*c will work
2011-12-03T00:34:46  <BenJackson> hah your Location one is even more fucked up :)
2011-12-03T00:35:01  <a1k0n> same fuckedupness
2011-12-03T00:35:25  <a1k0n> does this even run?!
2011-12-03T00:35:26  <BenJackson> oic I thought he meant "row + row*cols" instaed of "col + row*cols"
2011-12-03T00:35:31  <antimatroid> surprisingly yes
2011-12-03T00:35:43  <antimatroid> i just wrote it before though and obiously messed it up completely
2011-12-03T00:35:45  <BenJackson> a1k0n: when he fixes it his bot will get worse, too
2011-12-03T00:35:51  <a1k0n> yep
2011-12-03T00:35:54  <antimatroid> i haven't used this with my bot
2011-12-03T00:36:00  <antimatroid> i just changed it to 1d like 30 minutes ago
2011-12-03T00:36:03  <thestinger> 'row * cols + col' is what I do
2011-12-03T00:36:08  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-03T00:36:12  <antimatroid> i was just being stupid
2011-12-03T00:37:35  <antimatroid> BenJackson: which unnecessary casting?
2011-12-03T00:37:46  <BenJackson> the various (T&)
2011-12-03T00:37:53  <antimatroid> (T&) instead of &object?
2011-12-03T00:38:04  <BenJackson> I would suspect that class needs no casting at all
2011-12-03T00:38:13  <antimatroid> hmm, i shall try
2011-12-03T00:38:15  <BenJackson> and if you cast anything you're probably just masking errors
2011-12-03T00:38:21  <BenJackson> as with the (T*)matrix earlier
2011-12-03T00:39:47  <antimatroid> pretty sure the cast is needed
2011-12-03T00:39:52  <antimatroid> it wont compile without it

2011-12-03T00:49:14  <antimatroid> python is quite slow though..
2011-12-03T00:49:16  <thestinger> you'll probably get a much better performance boost by using pypy (which is available if you change your MyBot extension to .pypy)
2011-12-03T00:49:34  <thestinger> antimatroid: pypy is 4.8 faster than cpython
2011-12-03T00:49:43  <thestinger> so it's only 10x-15x slower than C, which is reasonable
2011-12-03T00:49:52  <thestinger> 4.8x *

2011-12-03T00:53:35  <codetiger> I use this line to update visible cells into land self.map[(self.map == UNSEEN) & self.visible] = LAND, My question is can I use self.visited_count[(self.map == UNSEEN) & self.visible] += 1
2011-12-03T00:53:37  <antimatroid> thestinger: but how fast are they compared to vectors to iterate through?
2011-12-03T00:54:30  <thestinger> antimatroid: dunno, but I use them everywhere and that's not where I have speed trouble at all
2011-12-03T00:54:50  <antimatroid> i might change to that then
2011-12-03T00:54:56  <thestinger> using a dict as a cache in python is an idiom, so I've been using unordered_map and unordered_set for the same thing and it works well
2011-12-03T00:55:35  <antimatroid> what i currently need to cut down on is updating battleNeighbours when i get water information near locations, that's too slow atm
2011-12-03T00:55:47  <thestinger> you can just use key.row * cols + key.col as the hashing algo instead of a generic one for pairs of ints
2011-12-03T00:56:01  <thestinger> ugly but fast :)
2011-12-03T00:56:31  <codetiger> need help on numpy python
2011-12-03T00:56:31  <thestinger> you could use an array as a set but that would use way too much memory
2011-12-03T00:57:00  <BenJackson> hmm, some experiments suggest that ChrisH is on the right track
2011-12-03T00:57:16  <thestinger> codetiger: I think numpy has functional programming stuff
2011-12-03T00:57:25  <BenJackson> optimizing: what to do when you don't know what to do
2011-12-03T00:57:29  <thestinger> I don't think you'll get a big speed boost from numpy though
2011-12-03T00:57:40  <thestinger> pypy is a 'for sure' massive speed boost
2011-12-03T00:57:41  <codetiger> :(
2011-12-03T00:57:54  <thestinger> your code will run 5x faster and your data structures will use less memory
2011-12-03T00:58:11  <thestinger> and ctypes in pypy is optimized with the JIT
2011-12-03T00:58:23  <antimatroid> unorder_set is c++11?
2011-12-03T00:58:29  <thestinger> antimatroid: yeah
2011-12-03T00:58:33  <thestinger> also in tr1 I think
2011-12-03T00:58:37  <thestinger> as tr1/unordered_set
2011-12-03T00:58:40  <thestinger> just use C++11 :P
2011-12-03T00:58:43  <antimatroid> that's cool, just not on any of the reference sites :P
2011-12-03T00:58:47  <thestinger> yeah it is
2011-12-03T00:58:53  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp
2011-12-03T00:58:56  <thestinger> best reference site
2011-12-03T00:59:54  <thestinger> cplusplus.com is really out of date
2011-12-03T01:00:15  <thestinger> doesn't even have the C++03 and tr1 stuff
2011-12-03T01:00:39  <antimatroid> wtf google "Showing results for unordered set C++
2011-12-03T01:00:39  <antimatroid> Search instead for unordered_set C++"
2011-12-03T01:00:57  <antimatroid> oh
2011-12-03T01:00:59  <antimatroid> nevermind
2011-12-03T01:01:10  <antimatroid> it's less obvious when it's all underlined
2011-12-03T01:01:47  <thestinger> you have to specialize std::hash for your own types, and then you can use them as keys
2011-12-03T01:02:16  *** codetiger <codetiger!~codetiger@122.164.130.200> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-12-03T01:02:50  <antimatroid> "For a small number of elements, lookups in a set might be faster than lookups in anunordered_set."
2011-12-03T01:03:09  <thestinger> depends on the hashing algorithm
2011-12-03T01:03:24  <antimatroid> i don't get what you mean with all the hash and look up stuff?
2011-12-03T01:03:38  <a1k0n> for a really small number of elements, a vector you do an O(N) search on is much faster than either of them
2011-12-03T01:04:17  <thestinger> antimatroid: they're hash tables, so they hash the key and store the value with that hash (and handle collisions for you)
2011-12-03T01:04:51  <thestinger> for a Location, you can just use 'key.row * cols + key.col' as the hashing algorithm instead of a proper one for pairs of ints if you don't mind evil globals
2011-12-03T01:05:21  <thestinger> antimatroid: http://pastie.org/2958456 that's the syntax for doing it, took me a while to figure it out
2011-12-03T01:06:01  <thestinger> there are no collisions, so lookups are always O(1) and fast
2011-12-03T01:06:12  * antimatroid is confused, but i don't really even understand hash tables aha :P
2011-12-03T01:06:19  <antimatroid> i'll play around for a bit and see if i can work it out
2011-12-03T01:06:34  <thestinger> just use the code from my paste and mess around with it
2011-12-03T01:06:56  <thestinger> needs to be after Location is defined and before you start using it as a key in the containers
2011-12-03T01:07:17  <thestinger> and it relies on that evil state global :)
2011-12-03T01:07:20  <antimatroid> what's it actually for? I don't even get that? like you have an unordered_set<Location> set, then?
2011-12-03T01:07:24  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T01:07:29  *** bmh <bmh!ada4e181@fsf/member/bmh> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2011-12-03T01:07:30  <thestinger> you have unordered_set<Location>
2011-12-03T01:07:33  <thestinger> so
2011-12-03T01:07:40  <thestinger> s.insert(loc)
2011-12-03T01:07:48  <thestinger> s.find(loc) == s.end() to test if it's in there
2011-12-03T01:07:55  <thestinger> it does an O(1) lookup to find it
2011-12-03T01:08:50  <thestinger> for orders I use std::unordered_map<Location, Direction>
2011-12-03T01:09:11  <thestinger> so I can do 'orders[ant] = direction', etc.
2011-12-03T01:10:35  <thestinger> set/map have O(log n) search time
2011-12-03T01:10:53  <thestinger> this is always O(1)
2011-12-03T01:11:02  <antimatroid> yeah, i will use these for my ants/hill sets
2011-12-03T01:11:03  <thestinger> depends on the hashing algorithm though
2011-12-03T01:11:10  <antimatroid> i might stick to vectors for neighbour locations
2011-12-03T01:11:17  <antimatroid> i only iterate through those anyway
2011-12-03T01:11:19  <thestinger> if your hashing algorithm always returns 0, then you have O(n) lookup since they all collide
2011-12-03T01:11:42  <antimatroid> what about < for ordering locations?
2011-12-03T01:11:56  <antimatroid> wouldn't you want to return 0 when things are "equally ordered"?
2011-12-03T01:12:04  <antimatroid> since < implies irreflexivity?
2011-12-03T01:12:19  <thestinger> well, you only need operator== overloaded for unordered_set and unordered_map
2011-12-03T01:12:21  <thestinger> there's no ordering
2011-12-03T01:12:31  <thestinger> your hash algorithm hashes 1 Location into size_t
2011-12-03T01:12:37  <BenJackson> 22:07 < thestinger> s.find(loc) == s.end() to test if it's in there
2011-12-03T01:12:40  <BenJackson> s.count(loc)
2011-12-03T01:13:02  <thestinger> oh, true :)
2011-12-03T01:13:14  <antimatroid> i wish it had s.elem(loc)
2011-12-03T01:13:24  <thestinger> it does, BenJackson said how to do it :)
2011-12-03T01:13:26  <antimatroid> it could just have both to keep sets consistent with other things
2011-12-03T01:13:33  <thestinger> it will always be 1 and 0 for a regular set
2011-12-03T01:13:33  <antimatroid> i meant the naming
2011-12-03T01:13:35  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T01:13:44  <thestinger> 1 or 0*
2011-12-03T01:13:57  <antimatroid> yeah i currently use s.count(loc) for ordered sets
2011-12-03T01:14:49  <thestinger> basically if two things have the same hash, it's a collision (and the container handles them for you)
2011-12-03T01:15:01  <thestinger> if every single Location has 0 as the hash, it's an O(n) container (basically a linked list)
2011-12-03T01:15:11  <thestinger> but since you can do a perfect hash, it's _always_ O(1)
2011-12-03T01:15:38  <thestinger> you can make your own hash table with an array
2011-12-03T01:15:49  <thestinger> but that's a huge waste of memory :)
2011-12-03T01:17:19  <thestinger> s.insert(loc) is like vec[loc.row * cols + col] = true, with a bit of overhead
2011-12-03T01:17:52  <thestinger> [loc.row * cols + loc.col] *
2011-12-03T01:18:14  <thestinger> anyway, easier to just use the standard lib container and only implement it as an array if speed is actually a problem
2011-12-03T01:20:56  <BenJackson> yeah I found set<Location> performance was only enh if it gets big, but it is so much faster to develop an idea that way
2011-12-03T01:21:06  <thestinger> set or unordered_set?
2011-12-03T01:21:10  <BenJackson> set
2011-12-03T01:21:12  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T01:21:22  <BenJackson> I'm benchmarking now, I'll try unordered_set
2011-12-03T01:21:25  <thestinger> using unordered_set with a perfect hash like this is very fast

2011-12-03T01:29:45  <thestinger> I knew about being able to disable/enable warnings but not the optimization part :D

2011-12-03T01:30:55  <BenJackson> could be useful in this specific environment
2011-12-03T01:31:30  <thestinger> I think it only works with the -f switches though
2011-12-03T01:32:38  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html the --param stuff at the bottom of this page is really useful
2011-12-03T01:34:52  <thestinger> link-time optimization and PGO are way nicer than trying to play around with that crap though
2011-12-03T01:35:44  <thestinger> since -flto isn't used (it might only be in gcc 4.6+ anyway), I've just been doing 1 big .cpp file with generic stuff in headers
2011-12-03T01:35:55  <thestinger> I like it this way better anyway :)
2011-12-03T01:35:59  <BenJackson> heh
2011-12-03T01:36:16  <BenJackson> I just moved stuff from the starter to headers that should have been there
2011-12-03T01:36:26  <thestinger> without -flto, gcc can't inline a function from a .cc file into another
2011-12-03T01:36:32  <thestinger> or do cross-file optimization basically
2011-12-03T01:36:34  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-03T01:36:43  <BenJackson> but I don't have any cases where that really matters
2011-12-03T01:36:47  <thestinger> with -flto, object files are pretty pointless :)
2011-12-03T01:37:02  <thestinger> I think the memory use increases a ton since it pretty much has to include everything in the .o
2011-12-03T01:37:32  <thestinger> might as well just compile everything in one go 'gcc -O3 -flto -o whatever *.cc'
2011-12-03T01:38:35  <thestinger> and I could use -fwhole-program :)
2011-12-03T01:39:04  <antimatroid> thestinger: hmmm, i take it you mean state needs to be global?
2011-12-03T01:39:09  <BenJackson> most of my key loops are either self contained (ideal) or are templates anyway
2011-12-03T01:39:16  <thestinger> antimatroid: yeah, or at least rows/cols
2011-12-03T01:39:22  <antimatroid> how do you do that?
2011-12-03T01:39:26  <antimatroid> just define it as global?
2011-12-03T01:39:33  <BenJackson> I wonder if I should do that
2011-12-03T01:39:37  <BenJackson> I tried to play it "nice"
2011-12-03T01:40:04  <thestinger> antimatroid: well, if you just use it in one file just stick it as 'static State state;' outside of function/class scope
2011-12-03T01:40:28  <antimatroid> i think i see
2011-12-03T01:40:33  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, my binary is so much smaller with it all in one file
2011-12-03T01:40:41  <thestinger> since I can make all the functions 'static'
2011-12-03T01:41:10  <thestinger> it's just 1500 lines
2011-12-03T01:41:16  <thestinger> yay lambdas :)
2011-12-03T01:41:35  <antimatroid> lambdardise all the things
2011-12-03T01:42:01  <BenJackson> well, shaved 12% off execution time
2011-12-03T01:42:04  <BenJackson> not bad
2011-12-03T01:42:12  <thestinger> putting it all in one file?
2011-12-03T01:42:15  <thestinger> or unordered_set
2011-12-03T01:42:19  <BenJackson> oh, no, other stuff
2011-12-03T01:42:21  <thestinger> oh xD
2011-12-03T01:42:22  <BenJackson> didn't get to unordered
2011-12-03T01:42:28  <BenJackson> lemme try one file
2011-12-03T01:42:38  <thestinger> and make sure to make all functions static
2011-12-03T01:42:45  <thestinger> or gcc might not try to inline at all
2011-12-03T01:42:53  <BenJackson> it will still inline
2011-12-03T01:42:58  <BenJackson> it will just emit the non-inlined versions
2011-12-03T01:43:01  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T01:43:05  <thestinger> but then it thinks code size will grow
2011-12-03T01:43:07  <thestinger> so it won't inline :)
2011-12-03T01:43:25  <thestinger> inlining is super conservative by default
2011-12-03T01:43:50  <thestinger> you need to tweak those mysterious --param settings to change that
2011-12-03T01:44:16  * BenJackson discovers one file missing an include guard :)
2011-12-03T01:44:30  <BenJackson> you can use __attribute__((__always_inline__))
2011-12-03T01:44:38  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T01:44:43  <BenJackson> I have used that extensively in ARM where I knew exactly what I wanted
2011-12-03T01:44:45  <BenJackson> also no_inline

2011-12-03T01:51:04  <antimatroid> i do in state.cc

2011-12-03T01:52:06  <BenJackson> ohh it's the hash
2011-12-03T01:54:16  <thestinger> antimatroid: hmm
2011-12-03T01:54:34  <thestinger> are you sure you can't do 'cout << "something" << endl;' etc. in the file you're in?

2011-12-03T02:02:08  <thestinger> the hash specialization thing
2011-12-03T02:02:22  <thestinger> .h files just get copypasted by the C preprocessor

2011-12-03T02:03:53  <BenJackson> so I converted all sets to unordered_set and it's a teensy bit slower
2011-12-03T02:03:55  <thestinger> BenJackson: try setting max_load_factor
2011-12-03T02:03:59  <thestinger> to tell it there won't be collisions
2011-12-03T02:04:16  <BenJackson> well really at that point I might as well use my grid<> class
2011-12-03T02:04:41  <BenJackson> unordered_set is just a map of a hash onto a flat array (with the perfect hash)
2011-12-03T02:04:47  <BenJackson> so it's identical to my grid, really
2011-12-03T02:04:51  <antimatroid> okay i think i'm good :D
2011-12-03T02:04:52  <antimatroid> thanks
2011-12-03T02:05:06  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah
2011-12-03T02:05:12  <thestinger> unordered_map might save memory usage though
2011-12-03T02:05:18  <BenJackson> thestinger: I may also be losing out because I iterate over my sets about as often as I search them
2011-12-03T02:05:22  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T02:05:24  <BenJackson> probably I should not have converted all of my sets over
2011-12-03T02:05:28  <thestinger> I never iterate over them really
2011-12-03T02:05:37  <BenJackson> I do for thing like sets of enemy hills
2011-12-03T02:05:40  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T02:05:52  <antimatroid> yeah i don't really ping my sets to see what's in them
2011-12-03T02:05:54  <thestinger> I use a list for unseen targets, enemy hills etc.
2011-12-03T02:06:01  <thestinger> I just check if a tile is a hile via grid
2011-12-03T02:06:07  <thestinger> hill*
2011-12-03T02:06:10  <BenJackson> I actually have a priority queue for moves
2011-12-03T02:06:18  <BenJackson> dating back to when I relied on that to help avoid collisions
2011-12-03T02:06:50  <thestinger> like grid[row][col].hill == 0, grid[row][col].ant > 0, etc.
2011-12-03T02:06:56  *** amstan_ <amstan_!~amstan@69-196-130-230.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2011-12-03T02:07:05  <thestinger> the lists are just for making distance maps out of targets
2011-12-03T02:07:36  <BenJackson> you didn't start with starter?
2011-12-03T02:07:40  <thestinger> I did
2011-12-03T02:07:42  <thestinger> I renamed everything
2011-12-03T02:07:44  <BenJackson> ok, someone else
2011-12-03T02:08:00  <BenJackson> anyway, I didn't mess with the starter's notion of 'hill' only working for immediately visible squares
2011-12-03T02:08:21  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T02:08:29  <thestinger> I did :)
2011-12-03T02:08:55  <thestinger> I have an enemy_hills list which is accurate based on known info
2011-12-03T02:09:00  <thestinger> and then visible_enemy_hills
2011-12-03T02:09:15  <thestinger> and hills on the grid are based on the same thing as enemy_hills
2011-12-03T02:09:29  <BenJackson> same but vice-versa
2011-12-03T02:09:47  <BenJackson> since I made a map of distance to all hills I can test that(loc)==0 for enemy hills
2011-12-03T02:10:09  <BenJackson> it's kind of a mess really what things I added to Square and what went in new grids
2011-12-03T02:10:16  <thestinger> yeah I make a distance map for my hills and one for enemy hills
2011-12-03T02:10:23  <thestinger> I just realized the grid info is redundant
2011-12-03T02:10:35  <thestinger> oh, well the grid does say which player has the hill
2011-12-03T02:10:37  <thestinger> so it's not
2011-12-03T02:11:59  <BenJackson> I never got around to caring who is who
2011-12-03T02:12:11  <BenJackson> my ants live in the moment
2011-12-03T02:12:55  <antimatroid> well unordered set is faster across the board as far as i can tell
2011-12-03T02:13:07  <thestinger> definitely faster than set if you aren't using order
2011-12-03T02:13:07  <Accoun> if bot dead cycled phyton client crashed
2011-12-03T02:13:25  <Accoun> stuped program
2011-12-03T02:13:27  <thestinger> the thing saying it might be slower than set assumes you don't have a perfect hash :)
2011-12-03T02:13:34  <antimatroid> Accoun: then write a better one :P
2011-12-03T02:13:58  <thestinger> I guess ints have a perfect hash by default
2011-12-03T02:14:24  <thestinger> but you couldn't do that for strings, etc.
2011-12-03T02:14:24  <BenJackson> again slower if you iterate
2011-12-03T02:14:25  <Accoun> please let pithon and all it addicts and autor all die
2011-12-03T02:14:31  <antimatroid> i must say, the code to get that hash function going is rather rank!
2011-12-03T02:14:40  <thestinger> antimatroid: yep.
2011-12-03T02:14:48  <thestinger> it's a functor (struct with () overloaded)
2011-12-03T02:15:11  <antimatroid> why does it hate std::hash?
2011-12-03T02:15:32  <thestinger> hmm?
2011-12-03T02:15:42  <thestinger> std::hash just has hashes for the built-ins
2011-12-03T02:15:51  <thestinger> I don't think it can even hash a std::pair or std::tuple
2011-12-03T02:15:52  <antimatroid> so where is this hash located?
2011-12-03T02:16:10  <antimatroid> like if i took out the namespace std{} part
2011-12-03T02:16:20  <antimatroid> you'd normally have like std::set, but std::hash it hates
2011-12-03T02:16:46  <thestinger> well, you need to go into the std namespace and add an overload basically
2011-12-03T02:16:49  <thestinger> well
2011-12-03T02:16:53  <thestinger> a template specialization*
2011-12-03T02:17:01  <antimatroid> yeah, even grosser :P
2011-12-03T02:17:05  <thestinger> it feels like a hack, but I don't think there's another way to do it
2011-12-03T02:17:06  <BenJackson> you just use unordered_hash<Location, LocationHash>
2011-12-03T02:17:12  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-03T02:17:15  <antimatroid> lol
2011-12-03T02:17:20  <BenJackson> it's Wrong to put a specialization of std::hash into std :)
2011-12-03T02:17:42  <thestinger> BenJackson: global variables are Wrong too :P
2011-12-03T02:18:01  <thestinger> and static local variables are ofc evil according to C++
2011-12-03T02:19:00  <antimatroid> BenJackson: can you give more explanation for someone who sucks with this stuff? :P
2011-12-03T02:19:10  <antimatroid> today is my education day for programming it seems
2011-12-03T02:19:21  <thestinger> antimatroid: well, you can instead make the hash functor in your local namespace
2011-12-03T02:19:28  <thestinger> and pass it as a template parameter
2011-12-03T02:19:42  <antimatroid> oh yeah sorry
2011-12-03T02:19:55  <antimatroid> i can just tell it to use greater<Location>
2011-12-03T02:20:03  <antimatroid> right?
2011-12-03T02:20:12  <antimatroid> cause i have > defined
2011-12-03T02:20:16  <thestinger> no
2011-12-03T02:20:20  <BenJackson> well that's not a hash
2011-12-03T02:20:28  <thestinger> unordered_map and unordered_set don't need operator> operator< etc.
2011-12-03T02:20:32  <thestinger> just a hash functor and operator==
2011-12-03T02:20:34  <BenJackson> struct LocationHash {
2011-12-03T02:20:34  <BenJackson>     inline size_t operator () (const Location &loc) const
2011-12-03T02:20:35  <BenJackson>     {
2011-12-03T02:20:35  <BenJackson>         return loc.col + loc.row * 256;
2011-12-03T02:20:35  <BenJackson>     }
2011-12-03T02:20:37  <BenJackson> };
2011-12-03T02:20:39  <antimatroid> err yeah sorry
2011-12-03T02:20:40  <BenJackson> typedef std::tr1::unordered_set<Location, LocationHash> LocationSet;
2011-12-03T02:20:47  <antimatroid> i'm having a bad day :P
2011-12-03T02:20:51  *** epicmonkey <epicmonkey!~epicmonke@178.130.5.103> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-03T02:21:03  <BenJackson> unordered_set has several template args, they just all have defaults but the first
2011-12-03T02:21:04  <thestinger> BenJackson: typedefs are evil too according to the C++ committee
2011-12-03T02:21:07  <thestinger> they added a replacement
2011-12-03T02:21:10  <thestinger> haven't tried it yet :)
2011-12-03T02:21:11  <BenJackson> the default for the second is std::hash<T>
2011-12-03T02:21:16  <BenJackson> which is how thestinger was "cheating"
2011-12-03T02:21:17  *** rmmh <rmmh!~none@host-80-87.flgaroy.clients.pavlovmedia.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-03T02:21:55  <thestinger> well, I'm also "cheating" because I use a global var to get a quick hash function
2011-12-03T02:22:33  <thestinger> yours will have collisions for rows > 256 :)
2011-12-03T02:22:34  <antimatroid> still need global :P
2011-12-03T02:22:46  <BenJackson> contest is limited to 200x200
2011-12-03T02:22:51  <thestinger> I know
2011-12-03T02:23:02  <thestinger> I like that my bot would work on 500x500 though
2011-12-03T02:23:14  <antimatroid> what the hell?
2011-12-03T02:23:17  <thestinger> assuming the limit is 200x200 feels dirtier than a global :P
2011-12-03T02:23:23  <antimatroid> are you not getting closest hill info each turn?
2011-12-03T02:23:25  <BenJackson> mine mostly would but some of the algorithms were selected based on the specific "n"
2011-12-03T02:23:30  <BenJackson> like attack radius, view radius, etc
2011-12-03T02:23:42  <BenJackson> not that they wouldn't work for different n, but they might not scale
2011-12-03T02:23:51  <antimatroid> i am going to incrementally calculate that info as i get vision and just recalulate it on the turn that i discover hill(s) have been razed
2011-12-03T02:24:13  <BenJackson> you don't see your own hills in any special way
2011-12-03T02:24:18  <BenJackson> you have to have an ant nearby
2011-12-03T02:24:23  <thestinger> yeah, you have to have vision to know they died
2011-12-03T02:24:32  <thestinger> and usually all your ants near the hill will be killed
2011-12-03T02:24:37  <thestinger> unless your defenders are cowards
2011-12-03T02:24:41  <antimatroid> like i said, when i know the hill has been razed i'll recalculate all shortest info

2011-12-03T02:24:50  <antimatroid> when i see an enemy hill i can just expand outwards and update
2011-12-03T02:24:52  <BenJackson> you could do cleverer things
2011-12-03T02:24:55  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T02:24:58  <BenJackson> like notice you are not spawning there when you pick up food
2011-12-03T02:24:58  <thestinger> like based on ant spawning
2011-12-03T02:25:01  <thestinger> yep.
2011-12-03T02:25:09  <thestinger> I thought about that
2011-12-03T02:25:10  <antimatroid> do you guys track where enemies might be?
2011-12-03T02:25:13  <BenJackson> I have tons of "clever" ideas
2011-12-03T02:25:17  <rmmh> uploaded to the contest server for the first time... timeout XD
2011-12-03T02:25:21  <BenJackson> but I need to make my bot better in non-clever ways
2011-12-03T02:25:24  <thestinger> BenJackson: same with me, but I'm too lazy to code them :(
2011-12-03T02:25:31  <thestinger> and it's too hard to test them
2011-12-03T02:25:34  <thestinger> too much noise
2011-12-03T02:25:42  <BenJackson> I'm probably going to start a thread on the forum just when the contest closes
2011-12-03T02:25:45  <BenJackson> about things you can figure out
2011-12-03T02:25:45  <thestinger> I have to run bots on tcp for days - and testing against my own bots is pretty pointless
2011-12-03T02:25:52  <BenJackson> from the easy ones like remembering hill locs
2011-12-03T02:25:54  <antimatroid> yeah, i have a couple of tricks i like
2011-12-03T02:25:59  <BenJackson> to complex ones like symmetry, ants in hill, etc
2011-12-03T02:26:13  <thestinger> I liked bmh's trick for enemy hills
2011-12-03T02:26:19  <BenJackson> which one?
2011-12-03T02:26:19  <antimatroid> which was?
2011-12-03T02:26:22  <antimatroid> number of moves?
2011-12-03T02:26:25  <antimatroid> in n turns?
2011-12-03T02:26:30  <antimatroid> it was cool, but i'm not using it
2011-12-03T02:26:34  <BenJackson> the number of moves thing is clever, but there is a much easier way
2011-12-03T02:26:47  <BenJackson> which I'm not even using because it made my bot worse but I'm still not telling :)
2011-12-03T02:26:54  <thestinger> if you see an enemy ant their hill must at most # of turns away
2011-12-03T02:27:11  <BenJackson> I should post it in the final days so people will add it and see what I saw: my bot attacked way before it was ready
2011-12-03T02:27:11  <thestinger> yay for crappy grammar in that sentence
2011-12-03T02:27:29  <thestinger> BenJackson: oh, that actually doesn't help my bot at all
2011-12-03T02:27:38  <thestinger> I can hardcode all enemy hill locations for a map
2011-12-03T02:27:43  <thestinger> so my bot will go to them right away
2011-12-03T02:27:50  <thestinger> does not help at all except on those crappy random walks
2011-12-03T02:27:54  <antimatroid> is there any performance loss from using a global state?
2011-12-03T02:28:06  <BenJackson> were you here when I pasted my trick where I have the game engine reveal my bot's hills to all other ants?
2011-12-03T02:28:07  <antimatroid> it might actually make my life easier rather than passing references to it all over the place
2011-12-03T02:28:10  <BenJackson> for testing
2011-12-03T02:28:30  <BenJackson> antimatroid: probably gain only
2011-12-03T02:28:40  <antimatroid> done
2011-12-03T02:28:40  <BenJackson> making it global is just not Good Programming Practice
2011-12-03T02:28:50  <BenJackson> what if you wanted to run multiple ants in one process?!
2011-12-03T02:28:52  <antimatroid> screw programming practice :p
2011-12-03T02:29:13  <antimatroid> i can run multiple copies of it without it confusing them though right?
2011-12-03T02:29:28  <antimatroid> i don't see why not :\
2011-12-03T02:29:47  <antimatroid> i'm not very knowledgeable on processes either :P
2011-12-03T02:29:51  <antimatroid> i stick to maths most of the time
2011-12-03T02:29:56  <thestinger> globals are probably faster than passing around references
2011-12-03T02:30:02  <antimatroid> yeah i got that :P
2011-12-03T02:30:03  <thestinger> but accessing a local var will be faster than a global
2011-12-03T02:30:12  <thestinger> so passing by value should sometimes be a lot faster
2011-12-03T02:30:14  <thestinger> due to cache
2011-12-03T02:30:23  <thestinger> State is huge though
2011-12-03T02:30:26  <thestinger> can't pass by value
2011-12-03T02:30:36  <antimatroid> yeah i realised that the other day :P
2011-12-03T02:30:49  <thestinger> C++ has move semantics and stuff now anyway
2011-12-03T02:30:58  <antimatroid> i was also starting my timer in the wrong place too
2011-12-03T02:31:01  <thestinger> so if you pass by value it will probably not copy (unless you modify it)
2011-12-03T02:31:04  <antimatroid> i now start it when i read "turn"
2011-12-03T02:31:09  <antimatroid> rather than when i read "go"
2011-12-03T02:31:19  <thestinger> like you can have a function return a std::vector, and it will move it not copy it
2011-12-03T02:31:31  <thestinger> assuming it's a local variable
2011-12-03T02:31:34  <thestinger> and you return it
2011-12-03T02:31:52  <antimatroid> wait what?
2011-12-03T02:32:04  <antimatroid> normally if i want to do that i just pass a reference into a vector
2011-12-03T02:32:05  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization
2011-12-03T02:32:12  <thestinger> well
2011-12-03T02:32:35  <thestinger> you can have a function make a local std::vector and then return it
2011-12-03T02:32:58  <thestinger> and it shouldn't copy it
2011-12-03T02:33:02  <thestinger> it should move it
2011-12-03T02:33:29  <thestinger> I just don't worry about performance at all
2011-12-03T02:33:35  <thestinger> I use all the fancy standard lib stuff
2011-12-03T02:33:41  <thestinger> then I'll optimize the stuff that's actually slow
2011-12-03T02:33:46  <antimatroid> i usually don't
2011-12-03T02:33:54  <antimatroid> but now i'm trying to speed those things up :P
2011-12-03T02:34:03  <antimatroid> because they're too slow
2011-12-03T02:34:10  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T02:34:13  <thestinger> always benchmark though
2011-12-03T02:34:36  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-12-03T02:34:43  <BenJackson> mine says my innermost combat eval loop is the problem
2011-12-03T02:34:44  <BenJackson> ...duh!
2011-12-03T02:35:53  <thestinger> wc -l on the assembly output is my 'feel good' benchmark after refactoring to clean up code :P
2011-12-03T02:36:25  <thestinger> it's nice seeing that I'm still smarter than a compiler xD
2011-12-03T02:36:56  <thestinger> sometimes...
2011-12-03T02:37:46  <thestinger> const hasn't changed the code gcc generates at all, but I like using it everywhere cause it's haskelly

2011-12-03T02:38:58  <thestinger> I think you could just give gcc a ton of memory in the --param stuff and it would do a better job
2011-12-03T02:40:20  <thestinger> lambdas have sped up some of my code quite a bit, I guess due to cache reasons
2011-12-03T02:40:34  <antimatroid> if I have "int index(const Location &loc)", how would i define the unordered_set<Location, ?>?
2011-12-03T02:41:49  <thestinger> you still need a functor
2011-12-03T02:42:13  <thestinger> just delete the namespace std { } around the hash functor
2011-12-03T02:42:27  <thestinger> and call it HashLocation or something
2011-12-03T02:43:32  <thestinger> I sort possible moves for an ant by how good they are, so I use a functor and pass it to std::sort like that
2011-12-03T02:44:04  <thestinger> silly, but it works

2011-12-03T02:45:37  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.10443 tcp is getting intense
2011-12-03T02:45:52  <thestinger> lots of bots do combat now
2011-12-03T02:47:56  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-12-03T02:48:09  <BenJackson> but wait until you get on aichallenge.org and play the 200 level bots that just suicide into you again
2011-12-03T02:48:43  <antimatroid> shouldn't they be easy?
2011-12-03T02:49:01  <thestinger> antimatroid: no
2011-12-03T02:49:12  <antimatroid> sit there and let them die
2011-12-03T02:49:16  <thestinger> my bot assumes the enemies are somewhat sane now
2011-12-03T02:49:21  <antimatroid> move back until it's safe to do so
2011-12-03T02:49:23  <thestinger> not unmoving or always offensive
2011-12-03T02:49:38  <antimatroid> ah, i am not staying static unless it's safe to do so or i need to
2011-12-03T02:49:40  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=152101&user=3473
2011-12-03T02:49:43  <thestinger> yeah, so instead of letting them slam into me, my bot might retreat
2011-12-03T02:49:58  <BenJackson> not to say I shouldn't have done better, but note how purple (cs_bot) sends every ant to my hill around turn 100
2011-12-03T02:49:59  <thestinger> I've made retreating really unlikely for now
2011-12-03T02:50:02  <thestinger> holding ground is important
2011-12-03T02:50:21  <thestinger> and most top bots won't attack because they think I have 100 ants saved up beyond their view or something
2011-12-03T02:50:25  <BenJackson> he actually loses his hill 20+ turns before taking mine
2011-12-03T02:50:36  <BenJackson> thestinger: exactly
2011-12-03T02:50:43  <BenJackson> good bots are cautious
2011-12-03T02:50:50  <BenJackson> and you both end up building up forces
2011-12-03T02:51:01  <antimatroid> this is very similar to how planet wars was
2011-12-03T02:51:02  <BenJackson> bad bots might make game-losing decisions that also cost you the game
2011-12-03T02:51:09  <antimatroid> you could count on top bots being more catious
2011-12-03T02:51:25  <thestinger> yeah, making my bot retreat ruins it
2011-12-03T02:51:32  <thestinger> so I haven't made it very likely at all for that to happen
2011-12-03T02:52:00  <BenJackson> note that in the same game the fact that purple went all south left a big extra area for orange to take over
2011-12-03T02:52:01  <thestinger> my second _precise branch also comes up with a better set of moves for the enemy - and I think it's worse than assuming they are bad
2011-12-03T02:52:14  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, n-player games are really noisy
2011-12-03T02:52:17  <thestinger> especially on open-ish maps
2011-12-03T02:52:37  <thestinger> the 2-player games are nice, but on open maps it seems really luck based
2011-12-03T02:53:02  <BenJackson> my combat actually finds the move that would kill the most enemy while losing the fewest ants
2011-12-03T02:53:06  <thestinger> if a lot of games got played it would be fine
2011-12-03T02:53:32  <BenJackson> unfortunately it's not really clear on trading off likely losses (due to likely enemy moves) vs likely wins
2011-12-03T02:53:36  <thestinger> BenJackson: atm I just come up with an offensive move for myself and my opponent (optimized a bit) then do a 2x2 matrix with offensive/defensive
2011-12-03T02:53:41  <thestinger> that's it.
2011-12-03T02:53:45  <thestinger> it works somehow
2011-12-03T02:53:53  <BenJackson> mine works okay
2011-12-03T02:53:57  <thestinger> optimizing the set of moves is the tricky part :)
2011-12-03T02:54:06  <antimatroid> thestinger: that's what i do :P
2011-12-03T02:54:09  <BenJackson> you'll just see it suicide ants occasionally on the off chance of some unlikely move by the enemy
2011-12-03T02:54:12  <antimatroid> and yes, it just works
2011-12-03T02:54:17  <rmmh> huh
2011-12-03T02:54:29  <BenJackson> I actually think mine is worse right nwo because I took out what I thought was a redundant/stale goal
2011-12-03T02:54:38  <BenJackson> related to attacking ants near my hill vs defending against them
2011-12-03T02:54:43  <thestinger> I'll probably switch to a method closer to BenJackson's bot once I get the eval function sped up
2011-12-03T02:54:50  <BenJackson> now I've seen my ants depart my hill and "slide by" attackers
2011-12-03T02:54:53  <thestinger> I'm just doing it this way for speed reasons
2011-12-03T02:55:05  <BenJackson> where the whole formation will rotate until my ants can get by and go do something more interesting like attack
2011-12-03T02:55:37  <thestinger> my ants will never really retreat when it would be a bad thing
2011-12-03T02:55:58  <thestinger> they only retreat when something horrible is definitely going to happen if the enemy moves towards them

2011-12-03T02:56:10  <thestinger> so my foragers get killed off easily
2011-12-03T02:56:29  <thestinger> before I had combat I just made my foragers avoid the enemy
2011-12-03T02:56:43  <thestinger> so this is both an improvement and a regression for foraging
2011-12-03T02:56:45  <BenJackson> that's another area where mid-level bots are a problem
2011-12-03T02:56:53  <BenJackson> if you do nothing to avoid enemies and play against top bots they will avoid your loners
2011-12-03T02:56:57  <BenJackson> (unless they can kill them)
2011-12-03T02:57:00  <BenJackson> but weaker bots will just run into them

2011-12-03T03:09:20  <antimatroid> the different between using int and uint8_t is huge
2011-12-03T03:09:26  <antimatroid> just for making the matrices
2011-12-03T03:09:29  <rmmh> heh
2011-12-03T03:09:37  <rmmh> so matrices are the solution to battle resolution?
2011-12-03T03:09:50  <antimatroid> like for 493 200x200 matrices we're talking like 120ms vs 2ms
2011-12-03T03:09:54  <thestinger> nice :)
2011-12-03T03:10:13  <rmmh> what matrices are these
2011-12-03T03:10:22  <antimatroid> just for storing path information etc.
2011-12-03T03:10:40  <thestinger> antimatroid: those are just booleans though right?
2011-12-03T03:10:42  <antimatroid> combat is all about game matrices/trees
2011-12-03T03:10:48  <antimatroid> uint8_t?
2011-12-03T03:10:54  <thestinger> yeah, what you're storing
2011-12-03T03:11:00  <thestinger> cause you can't stick much in 8 bits
2011-12-03T03:11:12  <thestinger> it will wrap at 255
2011-12-03T03:11:15  <thestinger> back to 0
2011-12-03T03:11:27  <antimatroid> characters
2011-12-03T03:11:33  <antimatroid> true
2011-12-03T03:11:52  <antimatroid> i don't need paths usually anyway
2011-12-03T03:12:06  <thestinger> uint16_t is enough for almost everything in this
2011-12-03T03:12:07  <antimatroid> ever actually
2011-12-03T03:12:23  <thestinger> I'm just using 'int' and 'unsigned' everywhere because I don't want to benchmark everything
2011-12-03T03:12:42  <antimatroid> you're back above 100ms with uint16_t
2011-12-03T03:12:52  <nalaginrut> hi guys! I've written a starter_package for GNU/Guile user. And I tested just now, it works. Anyone interested in it?
2011-12-03T03:13:27  <BenJackson> antimatroid: it's possible that it's a cache effect (you made your working set fit in the cache vs before it didn't)
2011-12-03T03:13:36  <BenJackson> but it's also quite possible that you inadvertently changed the behavior of your bot
2011-12-03T03:13:49  <antimatroid> there is no behaviour to change
2011-12-03T03:14:08  <thestinger> BenJackson: I think he's just storing bools with this
2011-12-03T03:14:13  <antimatroid> i stripped it yesterday, this is testing stuff in start up and the beginning of turn 0
2011-12-03T03:14:33  <antimatroid> thestinger: uint8_t t = 'c'; cout << t << endl; gives 'c'
2011-12-03T03:14:42  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T03:14:48  <thestinger> uint8_t is essentially 'char'
2011-12-03T03:14:48  <antimatroid> that's not a bool?
2011-12-03T03:14:59  <thestinger> same size as one :)
2011-12-03T03:15:10  <rmmh> uint8_t is just a typedefed unsigned char on many systems
2011-12-03T03:15:56  <antimatroid> wouldn't bools just be 1 bit?
2011-12-03T03:16:22  * antimatroid needs to learn more

2011-12-03T03:16:34  <thestinger> antimatroid: nope, bools are 8-bit
2011-12-03T03:16:42  <antimatroid> that seems a waste?
2011-12-03T03:16:52  <thestinger> the padding is there because addressing bytes is faster
2011-12-03T03:16:53  <BenJackson> well, bool is 8 bit
2011-12-03T03:16:55  <rmmh> bit shifting is usually more expensive than the extra bits of memory
2011-12-03T03:16:57  <thestinger> pointers go to bytes
2011-12-03T03:16:57  <BenJackson> vector<bool> is specialized
2011-12-03T03:16:59  <BenJackson> and is 1 bit
2011-12-03T03:17:04  <thestinger> so if you use bitfields, you need extra ops
2011-12-03T03:17:15  <BenJackson> my code sped up quite a bit by changing that to vector<uint8_t>
2011-12-03T03:17:21  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T03:17:31  <thestinger> vector<bool> isn't a container of bools
2011-12-03T03:17:35  <BenJackson> shorthand is:  vector<bool> is not a vector of bool
2011-12-03T03:17:41  <thestinger> it was a mistake to do it that way, and they want to change it to a proper bool vector
2011-12-03T03:17:44  <BenJackson> it's a dynamic bitvector named vector<bool>
2011-12-03T03:17:44  <thestinger> but it will take 10 years :)
2011-12-03T03:18:03  <thestinger> they need to make a bitvector, so people who need the space-optimization can switch
2011-12-03T03:18:07  <BenJackson> now while vector<bool> kind of sucks, bitset works pretty well, but obviously is not dynamic
2011-12-03T03:18:09  <thestinger> then remove vector<bool> completely
2011-12-03T03:18:15  <thestinger> then add it back later properly xD
2011-12-03T03:18:30  <thestinger> by 2020 C++ will have a proper bool vector :)
2011-12-03T03:18:37  <rmmh> agh

2011-12-03T03:23:17  <antimatroid> if('0') evaluates to true

2011-12-03T03:24:49  <antimatroid> why the hell would that evaluate as true?
2011-12-03T03:25:20  <rmmh> because '0' == 48
2011-12-03T03:25:30  <rmmh> oh, yeah
2011-12-03T03:25:51  <thestinger> antimatroid: 2 > 3 actually returns an int iirc
2011-12-03T03:25:59  <rmmh> wait what language is this
2011-12-03T03:26:02  <thestinger> since pre-ansi C and C89 don't have bool
2011-12-03T03:26:09  <thestinger> C99 and C++ have bool, but I don't think they changed that
2011-12-03T03:26:26  <thestinger> so while() and if() actually check for 0 or non-zero, there aren't really "boolean" values of things
2011-12-03T03:26:29  <antimatroid> if i use bool i can't index by matrix[loc]
2011-12-03T03:26:52  <thestinger> vector<bool> isn't a vector of bools
2011-12-03T03:26:59  <antimatroid> exactly
2011-12-03T03:27:25  <thestinger> yay for legacy choices being stuck in the language for ages
2011-12-03T03:27:37  <thestinger> in C (even C99) 'c' is an int literal
2011-12-03T03:27:37  <antimatroid> i want the speed of bool, uint8_t, be able to index as matrix[loc] and be able to call if(matrix[loc]), is that so much to ask?

2011-12-03T03:51:05  <thestinger> basically C syntax but newlines are used instead of semicolons (you can still use semicolons though)
2011-12-03T03:51:08  <thestinger> for { }

2011-12-03T03:52:46  <rmmh> antimatroid: quick, what's the equivalent of printf("%04.3f", 3.1) in C++
2011-12-03T03:53:02  <antimatroid> don't even know :P wouldn't it be the same?
2011-12-03T03:53:07  <antimatroid> or with cout>
2011-12-03T03:53:10  <rmmh> with cout
2011-12-03T03:53:29  <rmmh> (iostreams are terrible)
2011-12-03T03:53:31  <thestinger> you have to use all that horrific state based stuff, who the hell knows how :P
2011-12-03T03:53:34  <antimatroid> they compose nicely
2011-12-03T03:53:46  <thestinger> antimatroid: print(a, b, c, d) isn't that bad
2011-12-03T03:54:11  <antimatroid> meh :P
2011-12-03T03:54:14  <antimatroid> i'm stubborn in my ways
2011-12-03T03:54:22  <antimatroid> i don't like c's way
2011-12-03T03:54:39  <thestinger> yeah, the C way sucks because it's not polymorphic
2011-12-03T03:54:58  <thestinger> in Go you can fmt.Printf("%v %v %v", any_type, any_type, any_type)

2011-12-03T03:56:03  <rmmh> if you *really like* C++ you'd probably not like Go
2011-12-03T03:56:23  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T03:56:26  <thestinger> Go isn't a better C++
2011-12-03T03:56:28  <thestinger> it's a better C
2011-12-03T03:56:42  <thestinger> rust looks like it will be a better C++
2011-12-03T03:56:45  <thestinger> I love the choices they made
2011-12-03T03:56:53  <thestinger> http://www.rust-lang.org/
2011-12-03T03:56:57  <antimatroid> it looks pretty good
2011-12-03T03:57:02  <thestinger> I don't like D
2011-12-03T03:57:06  <antimatroid> neither
2011-12-03T03:57:09  <antimatroid> too much to remember
2011-12-03T03:57:12  <thestinger> it's too big, it suffers from the same problems as C++ but it's worse
2011-12-03T03:57:18  <antimatroid> haskell i have lost interest in i think
2011-12-03T03:57:28  <thestinger> haskell is really nice but it's like learning programming all over
2011-12-03T03:57:29  <antimatroid> i don't want to be looking up syntax to write stuff
2011-12-03T03:57:40  <thestinger> there isn't much syntax in haskell
2011-12-03T03:57:41  <antimatroid> not every 10 minutes anyway
2011-12-03T03:57:43  <thestinger> C++ has more syntax
2011-12-03T03:57:56  <antimatroid> like how do you do a queue in python?
2011-12-03T03:58:02  <antimatroid> i have to look that up every time
2011-12-03T03:58:08  <antimatroid> you have to import deque or something
2011-12-03T03:58:10  <antimatroid> wtf is that?
2011-12-03T03:58:16  <thestinger> why is that harder than C++?
2011-12-03T03:58:23  <antimatroid> it's easier in c++
2011-12-03T03:58:28  <thestinger> import module is just like #include <queue>
2011-12-03T03:58:32  <antimatroid> #include <queue> and queue<type> myQueue
2011-12-03T03:58:51  <thestinger> that's not easier
2011-12-03T03:58:53  <rmmh> is that a fifo queue
2011-12-03T03:58:58  <thestinger> rmmh: yes
2011-12-03T03:59:03  <thestinger> C++ has deque too
2011-12-03T03:59:12  <antimatroid> my point is in python you aren't importing queue
2011-12-03T03:59:19  <antimatroid> why are you not just importing queue? that makes no sense
2011-12-03T03:59:25  <thestinger> antimatroid: it's not the same
2011-12-03T03:59:25  <rmmh> you don't really need anything special for queues in python
2011-12-03T03:59:28  <thestinger> C++ has a deque too
2011-12-03T03:59:39  <rmmh> top, q = q[0], q[1:]
2011-12-03T03:59:41  <antimatroid> yes, but it's easier to remember how to do something if i'm importing something by that name
2011-12-03T03:59:41  <thestinger> C++ queue is just a deque by default btw
2011-12-03T03:59:51  <antimatroid> if i have to associate names with other objects i'm going to get confused
2011-12-03T03:59:52  <rmmh> q.append(something_to_push)
2011-12-03T04:00:05  <thestinger> antimatroid: that's a silly example though, a list can be used as a queue :P
2011-12-03T04:00:24  <antimatroid> yeah, but i don't want to have to use other objects for it
2011-12-03T04:00:24  <thestinger> deque is just a list where you can append to both ends quickly
2011-12-03T04:00:35  <antimatroid> i want a queue and i don't want to be associating it to other objects to get it
2011-12-03T04:00:38  <thestinger> antimatroid: so what about a tree or a graph in C++?
2011-12-03T04:00:49  <antimatroid> imo they could be there too
2011-12-03T04:01:06  <antimatroid> but i'd have it as #include <graph> and graph<Node type>

2011-12-03T04:01:27  <thestinger> that's a full tree implementation in haskell
2011-12-03T04:01:32  <thestinger> it can derive stuff like Show and Eq
2011-12-03T04:01:40  <thestinger> there's Data.Tree though, you wouldn't do that
2011-12-03T04:01:45  <rmmh> algebraic data types are really nice
2011-12-03T04:01:54  <thestinger> data Maybe = Nothing | Maybe a
2011-12-03T04:01:57  <rmmh> though *ML are a bit simpler to wrap your head around than haskell

2011-12-03T04:02:14  <thestinger> data Maybe a = Nothing | Maybe a *
2011-12-03T04:02:16  <thestinger> forgot an a :P
2011-12-03T04:02:22  <thestinger> and Tree needs that too
2011-12-03T04:02:32  <thestinger> those are all built into haskell though
2011-12-03T04:02:54  <thestinger> how do you implement a tree in python or C++ though? it's horrible
2011-12-03T04:03:16  <rmmh> antimatroid: did you post that matrix technique anywhere?
2011-12-03T04:03:26  <thestinger> have to use other types, structs with pointers/refs, etc.
2011-12-03T04:03:37  <antimatroid> which matrix technique?
2011-12-03T04:03:56  <rmmh> actually, any pointers to good threads for tactics
2011-12-03T04:04:05  <rmmh> I'm not quite sure where to start... I just have my ants not being suicidal
2011-12-03T04:04:08  <antimatroid> rmmh: where are you at?
2011-12-03T04:04:14  <antimatroid> oh for combat?
2011-12-03T04:04:30  <antimatroid> http://www.sifflez.org/misc/tronbot/index.html
2011-12-03T04:04:31  <thestinger> rmmh: a good start is implementing a function where you can simulate a scenario
2011-12-03T04:04:36  <thestinger> and see which ants die
2011-12-03T04:04:55  <rmmh> then what, just look at a 5x5 window around the ant?
2011-12-03T04:05:16  <thestinger> well, you could divide stuff up into whole battles
2011-12-03T04:05:21  <thestinger> that's what I do atm
2011-12-03T04:05:25  <antimatroid> partition all the ants!
2011-12-03T04:05:45  <antimatroid> thestinger: what about a...b...c...a

2011-12-03T04:05:56  <thestinger> rmmh: http://aichallenge.org/specification_battle.php there's math/pseudo-code and python at the bottom you can easily turn into simulate
2011-12-03T04:06:02  <thestinger> antimatroid: atm I think so because my code is retarded
2011-12-03T04:06:07  <rmmh> right, I understand how it works
2011-12-03T04:06:20  <rmmh> also, how to coordinate movements between ants
2011-12-03T04:06:28  <antimatroid> yeah i just realised yesterday i'm probably partitioning those a's together
2011-12-03T04:06:41  <thestinger> yeah and I have issues with walls
2011-12-03T04:06:51  <antimatroid> i'm fine with that
2011-12-03T04:07:21  <antimatroid> here's my way, for all moveable neighbours, add all land neighbours in the battle radius and each of those locations land neighbours
2011-12-03T04:07:34  <antimatroid> although i only check the land neighbours on the borders of the attack radiuses
2011-12-03T04:08:04  <thestinger> http://www.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial/data.html :D
2011-12-03T04:08:10  <antimatroid> then that gets the enemies for an ant, keep doing that for the enemies of each ant you add
2011-12-03T04:08:11  <thestinger> wow I'm looking forward to their language getting stable
2011-12-03T04:08:38  <thestinger> they basically have procedural haskell :)
2011-12-03T04:08:48  <thestinger> with functional stuff included ofc
2011-12-03T04:09:05  <rmmh> antimatroid: so when you have an ant that's close to an enemy, you form a cluster with all the ants that could be affected by it?
2011-12-03T04:09:30  <rmmh> thestinger: not a fan of new languages with semicolons
2011-12-03T04:09:40  <thestinger> rmmh: meh, they said they will probably remove them
2011-12-03T04:09:42  <antimatroid> yeah and then a battle partition is a set of ants that could land in battle with one of the enemies in the partition
2011-12-03T04:09:55  <thestinger> rmmh: they don't have the language stable at all yet, it's still very pre-alpha
2011-12-03T04:10:03  <rmmh> and then what, monte carlo? exhaustive search?
2011-12-03T04:10:06  <antimatroid> i'm currently working on storing these battle locations for each land location rather than calculating them to partition the ants
2011-12-03T04:10:15  <antimatroid> then what the stinger does
2011-12-03T04:10:19  <rmmh> 5^n simulations seems kinda expensive
2011-12-03T04:10:33  <thestinger> I do a 2x2 payoff matrix
2011-12-03T04:10:36  <antimatroid> pick defensive and offensive moves for my and enemy ants and run a minimax type thing where i assume the enemies do what's worst for me
2011-12-03T04:10:36  <thestinger> offensive/defensive moves
2011-12-03T04:10:40  <thestinger> but optimized a bit
2011-12-03T04:11:06  <rmmh> I was considering a pessimistic system
2011-12-03T04:11:06  <thestinger> I think BenJackson does all possibilities

2011-12-03T04:11:46  <rmmh> also do you have it running 24/7

2011-12-03T04:12:37  <antimatroid> or you could take the chosen states and incrementally try and move ants into better positions
2011-12-03T04:12:51  <antimatroid> only moving to a state which is better
2011-12-03T04:12:59  <antimatroid> so a hill climbing kind of idea i guess?

2011-12-03T04:14:23  <thestinger> doesn't work very well :P
2011-12-03T04:14:58  <antimatroid> i have neater tricks than that :)
2011-12-03T04:15:06  <antimatroid> :-X
2011-12-03T04:15:18  <rmmh> is a lot of it expert logic antimatroid
2011-12-03T04:15:18  <antimatroid> that's the closest to zipped lips i could find :P
2011-12-03T04:15:27  <antimatroid> i don't think so
2011-12-03T04:15:27  <rmmh> :I <-- zipped lips
2011-12-03T04:15:40  <antimatroid> there's a trick that might be less obvious but i don't think it's that helpful
2011-12-03T04:16:23  <thestinger> atm I would have to hardcode strategies like flanking basically
2011-12-03T04:16:35  <rmmh> what's the general flavor of the top-ranked pathfinding
2011-12-03T04:16:36  <thestinger> I might just generate all the moves... I haven't tried optimizing yet
2011-12-03T04:16:55  <rmmh> I'm using multi-target bfs so I can get food/hill gradients easily
2011-12-03T04:17:04  <thestinger> rmmh: xathis said he just used lots of BFS
2011-12-03T04:17:15  <antimatroid> i have variations all over the place
2011-12-03T04:17:30  <rmmh> any per-ant bfs though
2011-12-03T04:17:40  <thestinger> and I think that's what most people are doing (BFS, probably to generate distance maps or do diffusion)
2011-12-03T04:17:52  <antimatroid> i'd rather not go into too much detail there
2011-12-03T04:17:57  <rmmh> fair enough :)
2011-12-03T04:18:06  <antimatroid> i will say that some of my bfs's have specific orderings after ordering by current path length
2011-12-03T04:18:14  <ChrisH_> I noticed you guys talking about caching stuff in the startup time. I was looking at my pre-game caching code earlier and was reminded that I cache all possible Euclidean distance calculations for a game up front. Saves a lot of calls to SQRT() later.  ;)
2011-12-03T04:18:22  <thestinger> my bot is really simple, I don't really have any secrets :)
2011-12-03T04:18:30  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: never call sqrt!
2011-12-03T04:18:35  <antimatroid> square your euclidean metric
2011-12-03T04:18:40  <rmmh> hehe
2011-12-03T04:18:52  <thestinger> yeah, I have euclidean_distance2 as a function
2011-12-03T04:18:54  <thestinger> no euclidean_distance
2011-12-03T04:19:02  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: that doesn't work when you are combining the result with other linear values.  :P
2011-12-03T04:19:10  <rmmh> if you just want to iterate over the things within a radius, you shouldn't even need that
2011-12-03T04:19:21  <thestinger> rmmh: I don't, I paint that stuff on
2011-12-03T04:19:34  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: i'm currently working on caching for each square the land locations an ant can be in now to land in battle possibly next turn, then updating hte necessary squares as i get water info
2011-12-03T04:19:49  <antimatroid> and i'm also going to change my shortest hill stuff
2011-12-03T04:20:07  <antimatroid> update it as you get vision info, update it as you see enemy hills and re calculate it as you find out about a razed hill
2011-12-03T04:20:15  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: yeah, i already do a variation of that
2011-12-03T04:20:20  <thestinger> heh, I don't call euclidean_distance2 anywhere anymore
2011-12-03T04:20:35  <antimatroid> i'm not quite sure whether it's worth trying to update for a razed hill?
2011-12-03T04:20:52  <antimatroid> might just be worth the one turn recalculation
2011-12-03T04:21:27  <antimatroid> the only way i can think of is to bfs out and back in again
2011-12-03T04:21:55  <antimatroid> and unless you have heaps of hills i don't see it being worthwhile
2011-12-03T04:22:00  <thestinger> no manhattan/euclidean distance stuff is used in my bot anymore
2011-12-03T04:22:11  <antimatroid> what about at the beginning?
2011-12-03T04:22:17  <antimatroid> i have to calculate hte battle/view translations
2011-12-03T04:22:25  <antimatroid> my bot should still work if you vary those parameters
2011-12-03T04:22:37  <antimatroid> within reason of course
2011-12-03T04:22:39  <ChrisH_> I have a trick where I store the point of origin for any BFS expanded node so that I can reset just those nodes later.
2011-12-03T04:22:52  <thestinger> I copied the way to Java bot does offsets because it was a tiny bit faster than my way
2011-12-03T04:22:54  <rmmh> cute
2011-12-03T04:22:56  <thestinger> the Java bot*
2011-12-03T04:23:06  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: but then you need to know where to start the searches from when you remove them?
2011-12-03T04:23:12  <rmmh> ChrisH_: you do enough BFS that that's worth it?
2011-12-03T04:23:27  <ChrisH_> rmmh: yes
2011-12-03T04:23:45  <rmmh> I can see storing poing of origin being helpful for more things as well
2011-12-03T04:23:47  <thestinger> I do tons of BFS but it's not where my code is slow :(
2011-12-03T04:23:57  <thestinger> no point optimizing it atm
2011-12-03T04:24:01  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: that's easy, any neighbors of those nodes that have a different point of origin get reactivated
2011-12-03T04:24:37  <antimatroid> so you mark what the closest hill is?
2011-12-03T04:24:46  <antimatroid> do you mark what all closest hills are?
2011-12-03T04:24:49  <rmmh> I feel like if I just had some decent defense code my bot would perform a lot better
2011-12-03T04:24:49  <ChrisH_> that's one use of it, yes
2011-12-03T04:25:30  <thestinger> rmmh: defense helped my bot a lot
2011-12-03T04:25:33  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: not sure I understand the question
2011-12-03T04:25:44  <thestinger> and it results in big waves of ants being sent out after the enemy is repelled :)
2011-12-03T04:25:47  <antimatroid> like say you have H...H
2011-12-03T04:25:59  <antimatroid> are you going to mark that both H's are closest to the middle? or just the one that found it first?
2011-12-03T04:26:30  <antimatroid> oh, that'd be one idea, just queue up the closest hills and their location for each square, as one gets vision
2011-12-03T04:26:32  <ChrisH_> i used to know both, but managing mutliple values in a cell was too costly, so now it is just one
2011-12-03T04:26:50  <antimatroid> if you did it as you got vision i think it'd work alright
2011-12-03T04:27:08  <ChrisH_> but we may be talking about slightly different things here
2011-12-03T04:27:26  <antimatroid> i could set up a priority queue in each location of the closest hill loction
2011-12-03T04:27:43  <antimatroid> not sure about updating that info upon a razed hill
2011-12-03T04:28:13  <ChrisH_> I think the best choice depends on what you are going to do with the info.
2011-12-03T04:28:13  <antimatroid> or just an ordered set
2011-12-03T04:28:35  <antimatroid> i only want the current closest, but it's a pita to update when a hill gets razed

2011-12-03T04:29:35  <antimatroid> recalculating isn't feasible every turn
2011-12-03T04:29:39  <rmmh> what
2011-12-03T04:29:39  <antimatroid> it's too expensive on a 200x200 map
2011-12-03T04:29:49  <ChrisH_> I do it.
2011-12-03T04:29:50  <antimatroid> it's doable, but uses more time that i want it too
2011-12-03T04:29:58  <rmmh> I can do that in like 10ms
2011-12-03T04:30:02  <ChrisH_> yeah, I may redo that bit eventually
2011-12-03T04:30:04  <antimatroid> on a 200x200 map?
2011-12-03T04:30:11  <rmmh> let me benchmark it...
2011-12-03T04:30:19  <antimatroid> 1 hill, no water
2011-12-03T04:30:34  <thestinger> are you talking about making a distance map?

2011-12-03T04:30:38  <antimatroid> yep
2011-12-03T04:31:24  <antimatroid> i don't want to spend 100ms each turn calculating information
2011-12-03T04:31:44  <thestinger> it takes 30ms for me to do 1000x1000 for 5 targets
2011-12-03T04:31:59  <thestinger> hard to measure 200x200 without making a loop, and then who knows what the sneaky cache is doing
2011-12-03T04:32:36  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-12-03T04:32:52  <thestinger> 114ms for 2000x2000, 497ms with 4000x4000
2011-12-03T04:32:58  <ChrisH_> thestinger: start with an empty 200x200 map and do a full BFS from one point for the whole map, that's what antimatroid is talking about
2011-12-03T04:33:05  <thestinger> ChrisH_: yeah, that's what I'm doing
2011-12-03T04:33:09  <ChrisH_> ok
2011-12-03T04:33:10  <thestinger> filling a whole 2D array with distances
2011-12-03T04:33:30  <ChrisH_> what kind of CPU?
2011-12-03T04:33:44  <thestinger> core2 atm, 2.6GHz
2011-12-03T04:33:55  <thestinger> runs faster on my new desktop ofc :)
2011-12-03T04:34:01  <antimatroid> hmmmmmmmm
2011-12-03T04:34:10  <thestinger> Fluxid got his 3x faster than mine iirc
2011-12-03T04:34:16  <antimatroid> i'm going to play around once i fix up what i'm doing atm
2011-12-03T04:34:29  <antimatroid> christ!
2011-12-03T04:34:37  <thestinger> but he's using C with his own queue implementation, I'm just using std::queue
2011-12-03T04:34:56  <antimatroid> yeah i'm just using std::queue<pair<Location, int> >
2011-12-03T04:35:04  <thestinger> try not using pair
2011-12-03T04:35:08  <thestinger> like
2011-12-03T04:35:13  <thestinger> use a struct
2011-12-03T04:35:23  <thestinger> gcc totally screws up optimization when I try using std::pair
2011-12-03T04:35:53  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-03T04:35:55  <thestinger> I read that wrong
2011-12-03T04:36:13  <thestinger> I just put a Location on the queue, I get the new int from the current node I'm coming from +1

2011-12-03T04:37:47  <antimatroid1> although i think with that i do just use the path info i'm storing
2011-12-03T04:37:47  <antimatroid1> so yeah
2011-12-03T04:37:58  <antimatroid1> i'll play around after
2011-12-03T04:38:41  <thestinger> I just set the 2d array to -1 (meaning unvisited)
2011-12-03T04:38:47  <thestinger> then flood fill it with multi-source BFS
2011-12-03T04:38:56  <thestinger> and then -1 means water at the end
2011-12-03T04:39:07  <thestinger> and the enemy's hill is down
2011-12-03T04:39:20  <thestinger> ofc I use it for lots of stuff other than attacking hills
2011-12-03T04:39:30  <thestinger> lots of the searches don't go over the whole map
2011-12-03T04:41:12  <thestinger> I should really try just using a wrapped 1D array
2011-12-03T04:41:35  <thestinger> then I can memset (and maybe std::fill would use memset)
2011-12-03T04:42:05  <thestinger> well, for the bool arrays
2011-12-03T04:42:39  <thestinger> which are really not bools
2011-12-03T04:42:51  <thestinger> I use uint8_t for those
2011-12-03T04:43:28  <thestinger> meh, so that won't really help because I only use a visited array for partitioning battles

2011-12-03T05:32:10  <thestinger> iglo: if you want to know which tiles are visible, yes
2011-12-03T05:32:15  <thestinger> you can make it much more efficient
2011-12-03T05:32:32  <thestinger> you can precalculate the transformations and paint on information for radius-based stuff
2011-12-03T05:33:47  <antimatroid> it takes me 550ms to set up on a 200x200 grid
2011-12-03T05:33:56  <thestinger> :0
2011-12-03T05:34:42  <iglo> but it dont have an effect to find food or enemy hills?  isnt the information is transmitted my the game?
2011-12-03T05:34:42  <thestinger> meh, I had a util.hpp header with the intention of wrapping some STL stuff, but it only has one function :P
2011-12-03T05:35:13  <thestinger> iglo: if you don't care which tiles are visible, or when you last saw a tile then you can get rid of it
2011-12-03T05:35:18  <thestinger> well
2011-12-03T05:35:20  <thestinger> you do need it
2011-12-03T05:35:42  <thestinger> I dunno why you want to get rid of it
2011-12-03T05:35:44  <thestinger> :P
2011-12-03T05:35:51  <thestinger> how do you know if a hill is dead?
2011-12-03T05:35:58  <thestinger> you're only given info for hills you can see
2011-12-03T05:36:06  <iglo> ya
2011-12-03T05:36:07  <thestinger> so you need to know if they are visible
2011-12-03T05:36:21  <thestinger> if they are visible and not there, they were razed
2011-12-03T05:36:24  <iglo> i explore the map  and if thre is a hill i raze it
2011-12-03T05:36:40  <thestinger> so you never expect the ant that found the hill to die?
2011-12-03T05:36:50  <thestinger> what if they have 20 defenders?
2011-12-03T05:36:53  <iglo> if its dead I gues the game wont provide that information anymore
2011-12-03T05:36:56  <thestinger> and you just saw the hill
2011-12-03T05:37:05  <thestinger> iglo: you only get info for hills you can currently see
2011-12-03T05:37:11  <antimatroid> vision is an important aspect of the game
2011-12-03T05:37:14  <thestinger> if you can't see the enemy hill anymore, you won't be told about it existing
2011-12-03T05:37:36  <thestinger> so if you lose sight of something, you'll think it's gone if you don't keep track of it yourself
2011-12-03T05:38:04  <iglo> hmm
2011-12-03T05:38:22  <antimatroid> iglo: just store oldFood, and hill information
2011-12-03T05:38:50  <antimatroid> then after you read input, update vision, then for old information, if it's not visible re add it, if it is visible and you didn't get input for it, it's been collected/razed
2011-12-03T05:38:51  <iglo> currently I hv a pathfinder
2011-12-03T05:38:58  <iglo> but trouble with time/memory usage
2011-12-03T05:39:13  <antimatroid> yeah i have translation amounts for everything in the vision radius
2011-12-03T05:39:13  <iglo> so I cant go for food thats too far away
2011-12-03T05:39:27  <antimatroid> then i just bomb by getting the translation locations from the given location
2011-12-03T05:39:49  <thestinger> antimatroid: yeah, I do that for all the radius-based stuff
2011-12-03T05:39:56  <thestinger> like combat
2011-12-03T05:40:28  <iglo> anyone uses A* ?
2011-12-03T05:40:35  <thestinger> and I use layers of attackradius as metadata for various decisions (ar, ar+1, ar+2)
2011-12-03T05:40:48  <thestinger> need to account for walls in that though
2011-12-03T05:41:21  <antimatroid> thestinger: have you considered just using like loc.row*200+loc.col for your hash function?
2011-12-03T05:41:26  <antimatroid> that way you don't actually need a global
2011-12-03T05:41:30  <thestinger> yes
2011-12-03T05:41:34  <antimatroid> you could set it at like 2000 to be sure
2011-12-03T05:41:56  <thestinger> I like that my bot _could_ run on an arbitrary sized map
2011-12-03T05:41:56  <antimatroid> so why not do that?
2011-12-03T05:42:02  <thestinger> my State is already global anyway
2011-12-03T05:42:22  <thestinger> one of two global vars :)
2011-12-03T05:42:23  <antimatroid> yeah but now i want to have an unordered set in Grid
2011-12-03T05:42:28  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T05:42:35  <thestinger> yeah, so *200 will be fine
2011-12-03T05:42:42  <thestinger> I might change it to that
2011-12-03T05:42:48  <antimatroid> what's the max?
2011-12-03T05:42:56  <thestinger> 200x200 is max map size in the game spec
2011-12-03T05:42:57  <antimatroid> ie. what's the max size grid before you'll overflow integer with the hash?
2011-12-03T05:43:02  <thestinger> size_t
2011-12-03T05:43:03  <antimatroid> no, otherwise
2011-12-03T05:43:06  <thestinger> 64-bit unsigned int
2011-12-03T05:43:08  <thestinger> on x86_64
2011-12-03T05:43:17  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-03T05:43:24  <thestinger> well
2011-12-03T05:43:30  <antimatroid> so sqrt of that?
2011-12-03T05:43:33  <antimatroid> but what is that :P
2011-12-03T05:43:39  <thestinger> ?
2011-12-03T05:43:42  <thestinger> 2**64
2011-12-03T05:43:47  <thestinger> I guess you want the sqrt of that?
2011-12-03T05:43:57  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-03T05:44:05  <antimatroid> wolfram time
2011-12-03T05:44:11  <thestinger> so 2**32
2011-12-03T05:44:13  <thestinger> :P
2011-12-03T05:44:25  <thestinger> the highest possible 32-bit unsigned int
2011-12-03T05:44:28  <thestinger> it's not going to overflow xD
2011-12-03T05:44:52  <antimatroid> just making sure :)
2011-12-03T05:44:57  <antimatroid> i'll put it at like 2000
2011-12-03T05:45:05  <antimatroid> actually 10000
2011-12-03T05:45:12  <antimatroid> i want to see how large i can get my bot to work on :P
2011-12-03T05:45:48  <thestinger> well
2011-12-03T05:45:54  <thestinger> there are no problems if your hash function has collisions
2011-12-03T05:46:03  <thestinger> it just won't be a perfect hash anymore so lookups won't be O(1)

2011-12-03T06:00:58  <thestinger> operator==? only if it yells at you I guess
2011-12-03T06:01:13  <thestinger> but I thought it was required to deal with collisions
2011-12-03T06:01:20  <antimatroid> it seems good enough now, i don't think this is even really helping
2011-12-03T06:01:43  <antimatroid> it should be able to infer it from the hash though no?
2011-12-03T06:01:46  <thestinger> if I take away my operator== overload for Location my code doesn't compile
2011-12-03T06:01:53  <thestinger> antimatroid: no, because your hash is allowed to have collisions
2011-12-03T06:01:54  <antimatroid> oh, i have that
2011-12-03T06:01:58  <thestinger> think about a hash for strings
2011-12-03T06:02:14  <antimatroid> i even have operator- defined now
2011-12-03T06:02:18  <antimatroid> to get the translation values
2011-12-03T06:02:20  <thestinger> collisions just mean more than one thing is stored at the same hash
2011-12-03T06:02:30  <thestinger> change your hash to 'return 0' and see how slow your bot is
2011-12-03T06:02:48  <antimatroid> it's not actually doing anything with the sets atm i don't think :P
2011-12-03T06:02:55  <antimatroid> like i said, i stripped it yesterday
2011-12-03T06:02:57  <thestinger> all your sets will turn from O(1) access into O(n) like a linked list :P
2011-12-03T06:02:59  <antimatroid> i'm working on my information
2011-12-03T06:02:59  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-03T06:03:01  <thestinger> I see
2011-12-03T06:03:33  <thestinger> anyway like "cat" and "somelongthing" might both hash to 22
2011-12-03T06:03:40  <thestinger> so it has to have operator==
2011-12-03T06:05:32  <antimatroid> but isn't that the same as inserting "cat" twice?
2011-12-03T06:05:37  <thestinger> no
2011-12-03T06:06:06  <antimatroid> it is if "cat" == "somelongthing" evaluates to true right?
2011-12-03T06:06:22  <thestinger> yes, but std::string::operator== doesn't do that
2011-12-03T06:06:23  <antimatroid> ie. your hashes numerically capture a total weak ordering of your objects?
2011-12-03T06:06:37  <thestinger> well, the hashes don't have to be in order
2011-12-03T06:06:38  <antimatroid> sure, i just mean in general
2011-12-03T06:06:41  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T06:07:00  <thestinger> if you change your hash function to always return 4 for everything, the container will still work
2011-12-03T06:07:12  <antimatroid> okay
2011-12-03T06:07:14  <thestinger> s.insert(loc_a); s.insert(loc_b)
2011-12-03T06:07:14  <antimatroid> i'm with you now
2011-12-03T06:07:29  <thestinger> it will store them both in the same place (they both have 4 as the hash)
2011-12-03T06:07:35  <thestinger> but you'll have O(n) access
2011-12-03T06:07:38  <antimatroid> so == is like a save you in case your hash function isn't injective
2011-12-03T06:07:41  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T06:07:43  <thestinger> to deal with collisions
2011-12-03T06:07:56  <antimatroid> i think mathematically :P
2011-12-03T06:08:47  <thestinger> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Hash_table_3_1_1_0_1_0_0_SP.svg
2011-12-03T06:09:04  <thestinger> that's for unordered_map<Name, PhoneNumber> basically
2011-12-03T06:09:14  <antimatroid> yeah i get it
2011-12-03T06:09:14  <thestinger> so the Name (the key) is hashed, and then it stores stuff with that hash in that bucket
2011-12-03T06:09:39  <antimatroid> it's a function h:Objects->Numbers, preferably injective
2011-12-03T06:10:02  <thestinger> yeah, O(1) if perfect, O(n) if they all end up in the same bucket
2011-12-03T06:10:39  *** ztfw <ztfw!~ztfw@219.140.10.93.rev.sfr.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-03T06:10:42  <antimatroid> i'm fairly happy just passing it a function
2011-12-03T06:11:19  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution there are a bunch of ways to deal with collisions
2011-12-03T06:12:12  <thestinger> no idea what libstdc++ does, but since they only get you to give one hash it's O(n)
2011-12-03T06:12:31  <thestinger> for something like strings you could use different hashes, like 1 for the first layer of no collisions, etc.
2011-12-03T06:13:16  <thestinger> python has frozenset() (immutable set) and I think it will come up with better hashing than a set() since it can figure out an ideal way of dealing with collisions
2011-12-03T06:13:25  <thestinger> sets are unordered in python
2011-12-03T06:13:43  <antimatroid> i wish there was syntax for like x = min(x,y) but with x += y, like x min= y or something
2011-12-03T06:14:05  <antimatroid> one could always overload an allowable operator
2011-12-03T06:14:11  <antimatroid> but it probably wouldn't make much sense
2011-12-03T06:14:26  <thestinger> I think there's actually an operation for doing that in x86
2011-12-03T06:15:33  <thestinger> it's called clamping maybe?
2011-12-03T06:15:40  <thestinger> I forget
2011-12-03T06:15:54  <thestinger> because you're clamping x to within a range
2011-12-03T06:16:12  <thestinger> like x = min(10, x) clamps it to below 10
2011-12-03T06:16:27  <antimatroid> it's actually surprisingly easy to just get the closest hill info with vision
2011-12-03T06:17:35  <antimatroid> as you're updating vision if a location isn't seen set the closest hill to the minimum of its neighbours, then if you see a new hill search outwards from there, and if a hill is razed you have you calculate out to the vision border again pretty much

2011-12-03T06:50:31  <ThiagoRRamos> I`m not sure if `rounded` is the correct expression
2011-12-03T06:50:54  <thestinger> well, there are different types of rounding

2011-12-03T06:53:49  <ThiagoRRamos> LOL
2011-12-03T06:54:01  <thestinger> I guess you mean truncated (round down to nearest int)
2011-12-03T06:55:04  <thestinger> in math they taught us the 'round half to +infinity' rule only
2011-12-03T06:55:11  *** pairofdice is now known as cuda
2011-12-03T06:55:47  <thestinger> and then in chem the teacher was like wtf because we didn't use the 'round half to even' or 'round half to odd' (I forget which)
2011-12-03T06:56:08  <thestinger> good 'ol high school teaching everything wrong to make it simple
2011-12-03T06:56:21  <cuda> round half to +infinity? ehh
2011-12-03T06:56:37  <thestinger> "round up"
2011-12-03T06:56:47  <thestinger> well maybe they taught us "round half away from zero"
2011-12-03T06:56:58  <thestinger> so -5.5 would round to -6.0
2011-12-03T06:58:02  <cuda> I like that stochastic rounding. Flip a coin
2011-12-03T06:58:07  <thestinger> python does round away from 0 so that must be the common one
2011-12-03T06:58:22  <thestinger> or not
2011-12-03T06:58:42  <thestinger> haskell does that too
2011-12-03T06:59:10  <thestinger> I dunno why wikipedia says round up is the common one

2011-12-03T07:21:20  <thestinger> so 'if (condition) { it = s.erase(it); } else { ++it; }
2011-12-03T07:21:25  <thestinger> the iterator after the erased one
2011-12-03T07:21:51  <ssclift> Does the compilation use my Makefile or does it have its own?  I ask because --funroll-loops seems to break my code.  I checked with valgrind and it's clean, I'm not sure why there's a problem.
2011-12-03T07:21:54  <antimatroid> ohhh, so it returns the element after it?
2011-12-03T07:22:00  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-03T07:22:06  <thestinger> so you need to ++it if you didn't erase
2011-12-03T07:22:09  <ikaros> if you want to iterate further you can put the post increment into the erase like s.erase(it++)
2011-12-03T07:22:12  <antimatroid> you could do it = s.erase(it)--?
2011-12-03T07:22:41  <antimatroid> ikaros: that would erase the wrong element :P

2011-12-03T09:49:10  <george_> BUT with current mapgen, i am pretty safe assuming #players =8

2011-12-03T09:49:21  <george_> thats why i'm asking about mapgen

2011-12-03T09:56:19  <thestinger> you can't really do much with numpy

2011-12-03T09:56:45  <thestinger> numpy just lets you allocate arrays really fast... you probably don't do much vector/matrix stuff
2011-12-03T09:57:04  <thestinger> and the pypy version on the server is 1.7, the newest one
2011-12-03T09:57:25  <thestinger> it has great optimizations for ctypes, so writing stuff in C and using ctypes should let you speed stuff up

2011-12-03T10:16:17  <thestinger> I just make a distance map to enemies, with ones closer to the hill starting at a lower distance
2011-12-03T10:16:23  <thestinger> not sure how to pick defenders yet
2011-12-03T10:16:40  <thestinger> and I think I should pathfind to paths they will take to the hill, not really the enemies
2011-12-03T10:16:43  <Fluxid> well i do the same since i stole the idea from you
2011-12-03T10:16:43  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-12-03T10:16:47  <thestinger> xD
2011-12-03T10:16:57  <thestinger> how do you pick defenders?
2011-12-03T10:17:00  <thestinger> or do you have no limit
2011-12-03T10:17:37  <Fluxid> within distance X from hill, an then add higher weight for enemy closer to hill
2011-12-03T10:18:08  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-03T10:18:14  <thestinger> so you don't use a limited number of defenders?
2011-12-03T10:18:21  <thestinger> I'm trying to do that but I haven't really got it working...
2011-12-03T10:19:04  <thestinger> the problem is that ants closer to enemies can reach them faster, but those might not be the enemies closest to the hill
2011-12-03T10:19:04  <Fluxid> no, all closest ants rush to defend the hill
2011-12-03T10:19:08  <Fluxid> one sec, i'll paste

2011-12-03T10:20:37  <Fluxid> at turn 510 enemy breaks closer to hill and ants start to react
2011-12-03T10:21:16  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-03T10:21:25  <thestinger> you use a much larger distance within the hill than I do
2011-12-03T10:21:33  <thestinger> is it based on map size?
2011-12-03T10:21:58  <Fluxid> before i added the defence my hill got razed at turn 570
2011-12-03T10:22:05  <Fluxid> no, it's constant now
2011-12-03T10:22:11  <Fluxid> no idea how to make it dynamic
2011-12-03T10:22:57  <Fluxid> so it's 35 for enemy and about 60 for defenders (depends on weight)
2011-12-03T10:23:54  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_precise I had a major breakthrough in combat by tweaking constants based on win:loss ratio in local fights :)
2011-12-03T10:24:01  <thestinger> I wish my bot did things more dynamically
2011-12-03T10:24:32  <thestinger> but it's hard to figure out a good way to do something like choosing losses that will be accepted in combat based on something like map control
2011-12-03T10:24:36  <thestinger> same thing with defence...
2011-12-03T10:25:06  <Fluxid> so when there are more ants than enemy you attack even if your ants may die?
2011-12-03T10:25:19  <Fluxid> it's next thing on my todo list

2011-12-03T11:18:39  <ssclift> Ah... so I can count on GCC -funroll-loops then?  It's giving me trouble on Intel... not on AMD.  Can't find a specific bug report for it for GCC, but localized it to a region of code.  I hate optimizer bugs...
2011-12-03T11:19:01  <ssclift> All my ants start life heading North on Intel.  Checked with Valgrind... no troubles reported...
2011-12-03T11:19:18  <ssclift> Thanks.  A bit of re-arrangement of code seems to have worked.
2011-12-03T11:19:36  <ssclift> Probably my fault for using chained ternary statements. :)
2011-12-03T11:20:07  <ssclift> x = ? (fu) 0 : ? (bar) : 1 ? (baz) :2 : 3 ... looks pretty when nicely formatted. :)

2011-12-03T11:23:38  <bugnuts> It's interesting the guys who made Go (and C) deliberately left ternary statements out of Go.
2011-12-03T11:24:45  <ssclift> It's a hang-over from C's PDP heritage.  IIRC the ternary operator mapped to a single instruction on the PDP-11.  I've booted a PDP-11 from it's front panel but never hacked assembly on one.
2011-12-03T11:25:04  <ssclift> Except for occasionally shooting myself in the foot with operator precedence I love ternary operations.
2011-12-03T11:25:20  <ssclift> Let's me write very concise case statements when doing more complex assignments.
2011-12-03T11:26:06  <ssclift> Shame Ken Wellsch has moved on from UWaterloo, he'd be able to tell us about it...
2011-12-03T11:26:10  <bugnuts> I am indifferent mostly although I was surprised not to find them in Go.  I think Go as a commentary on what they wished they had done differently in C is telling
2011-12-03T11:26:47  <ssclift> So Kernaghan is working on Go?
2011-12-03T11:27:14  <bugnuts> most of my pdp-11 assembly has left me - I did do inner loop optimisation for fortran stuff back in the old days.
2011-12-03T11:27:42  <ssclift> Nice to see some of us old farts drag the walker out and show up to these competitions. :)
2011-12-03T11:29:36  <bugnuts> you see Ken Thompson on the golang-dev list not sure about Kernighan.

2011-12-03T14:44:12  <BenJackson> looks like ChrisH hit some kind of soft timeout
2011-12-03T14:44:51  <BenJackson> I guess if he knew he had umpty ants in his hive it couldn't be taken
2011-12-03T14:46:22  <bugnuts> I talked to him about that - he stops moving ants if the turns to end is < the distance to a hill
2011-12-03T14:46:55  <bugnuts> less storing up ants in the hill than freeing more cpu time for combat near enemy hills I think
2011-12-03T14:46:58  <BenJackson> he never saw my hill, though
2011-12-03T14:47:01  <BenJackson> probably a bug

2011-12-03T14:48:55  <bugnuts> yeah I pointed out the same thing to him on another match but he seemed to think it was working as intended.  I agree he should still be moving off the hive
2011-12-03T14:49:34  <bugnuts> I think he must use some penalized distance metric which takes into account some delay from combat.

2011-12-03T14:51:06  <BenJackson> looking at that game I see that ChrisH and I managed to "break out" equally effectively
2011-12-03T14:51:15  <BenJackson> but when he passed through an area he hilled all the enemies
2011-12-03T14:51:18  <BenJackson> whereas I was content to slip by

2011-12-03T15:13:23  <Anilm3> any pointers on how to implement combat?
2011-12-03T15:18:49  <Anilm3> no pointers at all?
2011-12-03T15:18:56  <Anilm3> that's tough :(
2011-12-03T15:23:25  <BenJackson> combat is the differentiator in the 10-99th (approx) place
2011-12-03T15:24:31  <Minthos> google minimax
2011-12-03T15:25:16  <Anilm3> don't worry BenJackson I'm not anywhere near
2011-12-03T15:25:50  <BenJackson> I just watched a game with #95 and #113 and I see them both exhibiting some minor combat awareness
2011-12-03T15:26:18  <Anilm3> Minthos: thanks
2011-12-03T15:27:43  <BenJackson> definitely seeing combat skills in the 50s and above
2011-12-03T15:27:55  <BenJackson> which is a lot more than there was last time I surveyed
2011-12-03T15:28:22  <BenJackson> Anilm3: I don't know that min-max, etc are really useful tips
2011-12-03T15:28:39  <BenJackson> they're just going to tell you "try their moves against your moves and pick the good outcomes"
2011-12-03T15:28:45  <BenJackson> which I think everyone knows
2011-12-03T15:28:58  <BenJackson> the hard part is representing the battle in a way that lets you do that fast enough
2011-12-03T15:29:39  <Anilm3> thanks BenJackson
2011-12-03T15:29:59  <Anilm3> I think I'll work on other stuff for the time being
2011-12-03T15:32:04  <rmmh> has anyone modified tcpclient.py to have output closer to playgame.py ?
2011-12-03T15:32:16  <BenJackson> you can't
2011-12-03T15:32:19  <Minthos> I'm not actually minimaxing, I'm doing blatant formation fighting and I have some fairly sophisticated "prediction" logic
2011-12-03T15:32:20  <rmmh> you can.
2011-12-03T15:32:21  <BenJackson> tcpclient doesn't know those things
2011-12-03T15:32:31  <Minthos> but I'm not in the top 100 either
2011-12-03T15:32:34  <rmmh> I can modify it, I just don't want to duplicate the effort

2011-12-03T15:33:10  <rmmh> "closer" to playgame.py, not identical ;)

2011-12-03T16:01:10  <g0llum> ;) of course
2011-12-03T16:01:34  <BenJackson> I'll probably read any Go entries that are published
2011-12-03T16:01:50  <BenJackson> I'm curious about Go but nothing I've read made me think it was worth pursuing
2011-12-03T16:02:04  <bugnuts> it's nice - I parse the json file and run games forward and can test different one step strategies.
2011-12-03T16:03:22  <rmmh> bugnuts: what rank are you?
2011-12-03T16:03:36  <bugnuts> 30th iirc
2011-12-03T16:04:01  <bugnuts> 33rd.  I did not put up a version with combat yet...

2011-12-03T16:04:15  <rmmh> 33rd without combat?!
2011-12-03T16:05:16  <bugnuts> I had avoidance and gathering and then ignore avoidance defending my hill or attacking another
2011-12-03T16:05:33  <BenJackson> I definitely see awareness of enemies around 100th place and what appears to be intentional ant killing in the 50s
2011-12-03T16:06:07  <bugnuts> any ants kills by me are purely accidental I can assure you :)

2011-12-03T16:08:33  <bugnuts> I think the version up now also turns off all avoidance if more than some %age of my ants are static.  Then they step towards whatever goal they had.
2011-12-03T16:08:55  <BenJackson> everyone seems to get to about there
2011-12-03T16:08:58  <BenJackson> then implement true combat
2011-12-03T16:09:01  <BenJackson> then their ant is worse
2011-12-03T16:09:03  <bugnuts> which makes them look like they are attacking but I pay no attention at all to whether it's good or bad.
2011-12-03T16:09:04  <BenJackson> ie less aggressive

2011-12-03T16:15:47  <BenJackson> you have to drop one of those methods in

2011-12-03T16:21:06  <g0llum> if it can be found on the path, it will just start working

2011-12-03T16:24:40  <g0llum> maybe not even
2011-12-03T16:25:09  <BenJackson> going to be hard to tell it's working because no games appear to be happening

2011-12-03T16:25:38  <g0llum> easy to change that

2011-12-03T16:29:07  <Anilm3> following each other in paths
2011-12-03T16:30:08  <bugnuts> mostly just happenstance.  if they are going to the same goal they follow the shortest path which makes them line up in places

2011-12-03T16:33:18  <BenJackson> because of how they all took different paths in the middle and then zipped back together
2011-12-03T16:34:55  <bugnuts> yeah they don't see the opening until turn 26 so before that they are pathing through the unknown spots.
2011-12-03T16:40:34  <bmh> this thing really chews through bandwidth. I'm seeing about 1mb of traffic per game
2011-12-03T16:42:10  <bmh> that's like... loading a single image on a website ;)

2011-12-03T17:27:29  <Kommander> oh snap, my combat code is working now
2011-12-03T17:31:27  <bmh> Kommander: hooray -- what are you doing for fighting?
2011-12-03T17:34:01  <Kommander> it's really simple
2011-12-03T17:34:19  <Kommander> i finally got all the numbers right for my diffusion maps
2011-12-03T17:34:46  <bmh> diffusion... I tried that. Couldn't get it fast enough
2011-12-03T17:34:46  <Kommander> my fighting involves throwing as many ants as possible at enemy hills, lol
2011-12-03T17:35:03  <Kommander> it's working alright for me, even on python
2011-12-03T17:35:20  <bmh> ha :) good job
2011-12-03T17:35:31  <bmh> where are you playing, fluxid?
2011-12-03T17:35:36  <Kommander> yea
2011-12-03T17:36:04  <BenJackson> the first time my ants intentionally killed 2v1 I was pretty excited
2011-12-03T17:36:30  <bmh> I'm still looking forward to convincing my bot to do something other than crash.
2011-12-03T17:36:38  <Kommander> i need to figure out the map gen thing still
2011-12-03T17:36:46  <TwistedLogic> thestinger: my bot  with a semi-working combat managed to take out 2 of your bots here. a little achievement for me.  http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.11541
2011-12-03T17:36:54  <bmh> Kommander: you mean for figuring out where their hills are?
2011-12-03T17:37:10  <Kommander> yeah
2011-12-03T17:37:19  <Kommander> and water + food hopefully as well
2011-12-03T17:37:25  <bmh> can I suggest something simpler?
2011-12-03T17:37:40  <Kommander> go ahead
2011-12-03T17:38:02  <bmh> Suppose you see an enemy ant on turn N. You know that their hill must be within N steps of that position.
2011-12-03T17:38:24  <Kommander> hm, interesting
2011-12-03T17:38:27  <bmh> So count the number of squares within N steps of that spot that you haven't seen and assume that they're all equally likely
2011-12-03T17:39:03  <Kommander> that's a really good idea
2011-12-03T17:39:04  <Kommander> thanks!
2011-12-03T17:39:14  <bmh> so around that area, each turn you can expand a region of 'non-informative' squares
2011-12-03T17:39:27  <bmh> but if you see another ant in a region that isn't marked as non-informative, you can do the same thing
2011-12-03T17:39:51  <bmh> They you can combine the data from your observations to push toward the most probable square
2011-12-03T17:40:28  <bmh> In the multi-hill case it's a little more complicated, but should be workable. (I haven't implemented this yet because my bot is still exploding)
2011-12-03T17:41:23  <Kommander> well, my bot is okay for early - mid game, but it's having trouble navigating bigger maze maps due to the way i am setting defusion values
2011-12-03T17:41:52  <Kommander> so oftentimes, it can't find the hills across the map
2011-12-03T17:42:07  <Kommander> so i was thinking of doing the map rotation + a bfs
2011-12-03T17:42:31  <Kommander> but i will see what i can do with your plan, it seems simple to impliment
2011-12-03T17:43:11  <bmh> I think it's good enough that symmetry detection won't add much.
2011-12-03T17:43:38  <Kommander> it sounds pretty amazing
2011-12-03T17:43:50  <Kommander> my other bug right now is my bot is way too suicide happy
2011-12-03T17:43:57  <Kommander> well, as in even trades
2011-12-03T17:44:11  <Kommander> so i die in pincer attacks
2011-12-03T17:45:38  <McLeopold> bmh: you have a tcp server now? http://paste.aichallenge.org/aTASO/
2011-12-03T17:45:58  <bmh> McLeopold: yes, it's on the forums -- bhickey.net:2080
2011-12-03T17:46:37  <bmh> McLeopold: can we get a four player map where all the hills are initially visible from eachother but the walking distance between them is far? :)
2011-12-03T17:46:46  <McLeopold> yes
2011-12-03T17:47:03  <McLeopold> how many?

2011-12-03T21:33:18  <olexs1> that was a while ago, I don't remember the name

2011-12-03T21:33:39  <Kommander> ty
2011-12-03T21:33:55  <rmmh> please link a game with that if you come across one :)
2011-12-03T21:34:21  <Kommander> i remember seeing one
2011-12-03T21:34:25  <Kommander> let me try to find it

2011-12-03T21:37:19  <olexs1> finally, I think I've got a version worthy of aichallenge reupload
2011-12-03T21:37:37  <Kommander> well, here's a bot that paints
2011-12-03T21:37:38  <Kommander> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=95642
2011-12-03T21:37:46  <olexs1> after bloody days of getting nowhere..
2011-12-03T21:38:40  <jstrong> did you do thta Kommander
2011-12-03T21:38:48  <jstrong> that's awesome
2011-12-03T21:38:56  <jstrong> i think everyone has had the idea but seeing someone actually do it
2011-12-03T21:38:57  <jstrong> awesome
2011-12-03T21:39:49  <rmmh> Kommander: niiice
2011-12-03T21:40:01  <Ashoka> Kommander :cool! is that your bot ?
2011-12-03T21:40:35  <Kommander> no i wish i am that good
2011-12-03T21:43:57  <olexs1> could it be that aichallenge servers are struggling right now? very slow page loads
2011-12-03T21:45:29  <rmmh> are hills reported every turn or only the first turn they're seen?
2011-12-03T21:45:38  <olexs1> rmmh: every turn
2011-12-03T21:45:52  <olexs1> only water is first time
2011-12-03T21:45:57  <rmmh> that's what I thought
2011-12-03T21:46:08  <olexs1> that's what specifications say :)
2011-12-03T21:46:20  <rmmh> you're faster than the specifications ;)
2011-12-03T21:46:30  <bugnuts> GG http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=136374&user=986&turn=239
2011-12-03T21:46:34  <rmmh> I'm just modifying tcpclient to do some basic parsing
2011-12-03T21:46:42  <rmmh> so I get one line per turn instead of a bunch of stuff
2011-12-03T21:47:04  <olexs1> hm... this sucks. I want to upload my new bot and go to sleep, but can't get any aichallenge page to load at all
2011-12-03T21:47:17  <Ashoka> olexs1 : best wishes for your newer bot!
2011-12-03T21:47:42  <olexs1> Ashoka: thanks
2011-12-03T21:48:11  <Ashoka> olexs1: pages do load for me, must be a connection issue from ur end.
2011-12-03T21:49:15  <Kommander> haha thanks bugnuts
2011-12-03T21:49:25  <bugnuts> np
2011-12-03T21:53:05  <Ashoka> bugnuts: you have taken bit of a risk than the earlier game since u painted while the game is long way from finishing.... did u get late by few turns to get the painting on the final hill ?
2011-12-03T21:54:03  <rmmh> Ashoka: this isn't bugnuts'

2011-12-03T21:57:02  <Kommander> tcp server is crushing my bot :'(
2011-12-03T21:57:53  <rmmh> yeah...
2011-12-03T21:58:01  <rmmh> I blame all the top people running multiple instances 24/7
2011-12-03T21:58:09  <olexs> bots on tcp are hardcore

2011-12-03T21:58:37  <olexs> many top100 players have experimental version running on fluxid
2011-12-03T21:59:08  <Ashoka> Kommander: I noticed we need to give about 40ms more for the tcp server. (to submit moves I guess) and also, bots with faster CPUs/bandwidth will have4 a bit of a edge.

2011-12-03T22:01:46  <olexs> lol. my desktop cannot load anything from aichallenge, but my mobile can... guess my provider has something messed up

2011-12-03T22:11:00  <Kommander> anyone have any idea as to how the end ranking is going to work?
2011-12-03T22:14:19  <bugnuts> I think same as the current competition only submissions frozen and I heard more workers
2011-12-03T22:16:12  <rmmh> probably a new set of maps as well
