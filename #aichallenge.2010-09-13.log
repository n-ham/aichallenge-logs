2010-09-13T00:01:28  <Mathnerd314> PlanetWarrior: in answer to your original question, the answer is IIRC yes
2010-09-13T00:01:47  <Mathnerd314> well, "another quick question"
2010-09-13T00:01:56  <RobotCaleb> git status
2010-09-13T00:01:57  <RobotCaleb> err
2010-09-13T00:02:03  * RobotCaleb backs out slowly
2010-09-13T00:02:06  <PlanetWarrior> Thanks for that Mathnerd314. Am I alone in thinking that this is rather unsatisfactory?
2010-09-13T00:02:29  <Mathnerd314> PlanetWarrior: I think it's just fine :-)
2010-09-13T00:05:24  <PlanetWarrior> I hope there's something which forbids planets occurring so close together. If you have a bot that has an internal model of the game state which it updates from turn to turn, it should be able to ignore all the planet stuff and the fleets it's already seen and just look at the fleets just launched which to my mind should be equivalent to the list of orders.

2010-09-13T00:07:13  <Mathnerd314> nope, nothing forbidding it
2010-09-13T00:07:34  <deepblue> I like planets with a distance of 1, sounds fun :)
2010-09-13T00:07:35  <a1k0n> as long as two planets have different x,y coords they will be >= 1 turn apart
2010-09-13T00:08:00  <deepblue> true
2010-09-13T00:08:01  <sigh> we need a close packed map and then develop stealth strategies :D
2010-09-13T00:08:18  <sigh> ah, ok
2010-09-13T00:08:23  <deepblue> the distance is ceil so they should always show up don't they?
2010-09-13T00:09:27  <jmreardon> if they're <= 1 unit distant, you would have: issue order => execute turn => fleet moves 1 unit => caps planet, yes?
2010-09-13T00:10:10  <a1k0n> hmm.  i think the fleet would exist in flight for one turn
2010-09-13T00:10:26  <a1k0n> but maybe not
2010-09-13T00:10:35  <ratatata> nope, if you send a fleet to distance of 1, it never enters Fleet list
2010-09-13T00:11:00  <Mathnerd314> PlanetWarrior: the current map generator seems to avoid distance <=1 planets though
2010-09-13T00:11:05  <greghaynes> The fleet would exist in a 'virtual state' while the waveform colapses
2010-09-13T00:11:22  <preetum> lol
2010-09-13T00:11:40  <a1k0n> yes, there is a superposition of fleets if you send multiple ones
2010-09-13T00:11:56  <preetum> but there aren't any interferance effects
2010-09-13T00:12:00  <preetum> thankfully...
2010-09-13T00:12:03  <Mathnerd314> @later tell j3camero can we assume that planets are always >1 turn apart?
2010-09-13T00:12:03  <contestbot> Mathnerd314: The operation succeeded.
2010-09-13T00:12:12  <greghaynes> Yes, otherwise our algos would have a much harder time
2010-09-13T00:12:34  <deepblue> mmh
2010-09-13T00:12:45  <deepblue> sounds fun to me
2010-09-13T00:12:45  <preetum> what is contestbot?
2010-09-13T00:12:48  <deepblue> I think
2010-09-13T00:12:49  <greghaynes> You may need to account for the fleet diffraction pattern when you send them between the two closely placed planets
2010-09-13T00:12:52  <amstan> Mathnerd314: stop bothering j3camero directly, there's other people that can answer your questions
2010-09-13T00:13:00  <deepblue> the next AI challenge should be with invisible enemy fleets :D

2010-09-13T00:34:09  <jmcarthur> i mean, i might not succeed, but i'll try
2010-09-13T00:34:30  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: that's impossible, because I'm writing my bot in Haskell :p
2010-09-13T00:34:37  <bss03> jmcarthur: I'm second at #66.  However, I'm pretty sure I can beat __init__ with a few more tweaks.
2010-09-13T00:34:41  <shawnshekari> I see what's wrong ratatata, somehow a weight got adjusted down to zero... lol
2010-09-13T00:35:02  <DirtyKeyboard> I submit my bot and don't get an email about failing to compile or succeeding.. and yeah, it just stinks not having ANY version of my bot there

2010-09-13T00:37:49  <bss03> DirtyKeyboard: Sometime during day 1, the host got flagged by Google (HA!) has sending too much to be normal, so most likely SPAM.
2010-09-13T00:38:01  <DirtyKeyboard> bss03: and yeah, ragebot is an annoying thing to beat... I might have to program specifically to counter that strategy
2010-09-13T00:38:48  <rwa> bss03:  I struggle with RageBot too
2010-09-13T00:39:00  <rwa> especially map 30
2010-09-13T00:39:07  <bss03> DirtyKeyboard: So far, I dn't have the am-i-winning-or-losing logic that DualBot uses and I don't maintain any state between turns.
2010-09-13T00:39:29  <bss03> So, there's plenty of room for improvement. >:)
2010-09-13T00:39:42  <ratatata> map26 and map30 are close starters, if you attack > cant gain enough and loose main planet -> you loose .. I just ignore those cases for now :)
2010-09-13T00:39:55  <ratatata> *against RageBot that is
2010-09-13T00:40:24  <deepblue> I use map 1, 20 and 30 alot for testing
2010-09-13T00:40:36  <bss03> ratatata: I think if my bot was just a little less aggressive with how many ship it is willing to send out the first turn I might have a chance against RB as is.
2010-09-13T00:41:13  <rwa> I haven't quite figured out map 30 yet - it's easy to hold to a stalemate, but hard to fan out and build growth without sacrificing too much and falling behind.
2010-09-13T00:41:38  <bss03> As the code stands, there's no limit other than the number of ships on planet for the fleets I send out in a turn, which does really hurt against RB.
2010-09-13T00:42:02  <rwa> bss03: you leave yourself open for big, quick attacks, right?

2010-09-13T00:42:47  <bss03> rwa: Yeah, if we start close, or your bot can simply count how much my home planet is gonna gain by the time you get there, taking my home planet first thing usually kills me.

2010-09-13T00:44:46  <jmcarthur> the best way is to file a bug report (after checking to make sure it's not already there, of course)
2010-09-13T00:44:50  <bss03> I still don't have code to reinforce planets, so if your bot is smart enough to correctly gage the number of ship required to take it over, you'll get my planets.

2010-09-13T00:44:51  <contestbot> jmcarthur: issues = http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/list
2010-09-13T00:45:19  <bss03> That's my next improvement; including some code for reinforcing planets.
2010-09-13T00:45:23  <jmcarthur> actually, that's second best
2010-09-13T00:45:28  <jmcarthur> the best is to write a patch :D
2010-09-13T00:45:39  <sigh> bss03: defence is pretty much the key to beating ragebot
2010-09-13T00:46:09  <bss03> sigh: I was told that last night, but the two improvement I implemented today wouldn't let me think about it until I had them in the code. :(
2010-09-13T00:46:43  <sigh> yeah, fair enough
2010-09-13T00:47:05  <sigh> I also have a lot of stuff on my todo list and no time to implement them
2010-09-13T00:47:55  <bss03> I'm hoping that jaspervdj wil submit the Haskell package and it can become official.

2010-09-13T00:55:10  <jmcarthur> that's basically game tree search
2010-09-13T00:55:11  <sigh> you can't just brute force all moves like in chess
2010-09-13T00:55:21  <jmcarthur> well, you can, but you'll time out :P
2010-09-13T00:55:22  <bss03> I should pad my orders with [Order s d 0 | s <- IM.keys myPlanets, d <- IM.keys planets]. >:)
2010-09-13T00:55:23  <sigh> :)
2010-09-13T00:55:41  * jmcarthur scolds bss03
2010-09-13T00:56:00  <bss03> Just to confuse the guys that are doing fleet calculations, and have the visualizer completely unreadble.
2010-09-13T00:56:23  <jmcarthur> while you're at it, just do that several times
2010-09-13T00:56:33  <deepblue> the state space is like (25*25)^(highest number of ships on a planet)
2010-09-13T00:56:41  <jmcarthur> because unless i'm mistaken fleets still aren't merged
2010-09-13T00:56:41  <deepblue> assumed 25 is the max amount of planets
2010-09-13T00:57:02  <deepblue> and that is only for what you can do
2010-09-13T00:57:12  <deepblue> and you have to do that for the enemy too for every round
2010-09-13T00:57:17  <jmcarthur> one ply!
2010-09-13T00:57:22  <deepblue> a little much for brute force :)
2010-09-13T00:57:53  <dstufft_> might be fun to try the game played like speed chess
2010-09-13T00:57:55  <joebob> yeah, I'm sure I could do a smaller sampling..
2010-09-13T00:57:56  <dstufft_> too late now though
2010-09-13T00:58:02  <deepblue> which is good, this way we won't have a perfect playing bot running around
2010-09-13T00:58:05  <dstufft_> but limit based on total time instead of per turn
2010-09-13T00:58:20  <jmcarthur> i don't think my computer can even calculate that number naively
2010-09-13T00:58:26  <jmcarthur> even with bignum

2010-09-13T00:58:41  <deepblue> ^^
2010-09-13T00:59:02  <jmcarthur> (assuming 50 max ships on a planet each turn)
2010-09-13T00:59:15  <deepblue> and 200 rounds
2010-09-13T00:59:18  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-13T00:59:26  <deepblue> i guess you would only need to go like a few rounds in the future
2010-09-13T00:59:28  <deepblue> but still
2010-09-13T00:59:30  <deepblue> way too much
2010-09-13T00:59:48  <deepblue> even if you reduce that and simplify the ships
2010-09-13T00:59:54  <ratatata> how long does it take for an inactive entry disappear from benzedrine.cx?
2010-09-13T01:00:23  <sigh> even if you did manage to go a few rounds in, you need a good evaluation function
2010-09-13T01:00:33  <sigh> it's not immediatly obvious that just plain #ships will cut it
2010-09-13T01:00:45  <deepblue> ^^
2010-09-13T01:01:13  <joebob> yeah, the evaluation function is the secret sauce..
2010-09-13T01:02:22  <bss03> You might be able to do some rough searching assuming that a player "optimally" attacks a single planet per turn.
2010-09-13T01:03:17  <bss03> You branching factor is still 625, butwhat searchable.
2010-09-13T01:03:21  <jmcarthur> dang, (^) is right associative ^_^
2010-09-13T01:03:36  <jmcarthur> that's why my computer can't do it

2010-09-13T01:04:02  <sigh> yeah, I tried in python and had to kill it

2010-09-13T01:06:48  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: does cabal work on the server?
2010-09-13T01:06:54  <joebob> are you guys maintaining a lot of state between moves?
2010-09-13T01:06:59  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: what would you use cabal for?
2010-09-13T01:07:05  <jmcarthur> joebob: oh yes
2010-09-13T01:07:07  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: building
2010-09-13T01:07:18  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: it just uses ghc -O2 --make MyBot.hs -v0
2010-09-13T01:08:00  <jmcarthur> haha, converted it to Double and it just says Infinity
2010-09-13T01:08:08  <jmcarthur> duh
2010-09-13T01:08:27  <jmcarthur> no way it would fit. don't know what i was thinking at all
2010-09-13T01:09:10  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: if C++ can use Makefiles, then Haskell should be able to use Cabal files
2010-09-13T01:09:11  <bss03> Try using Data.Number.CReal.CReal.
2010-09-13T01:09:20  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: C++ is using makefiles?

2010-09-13T01:09:26  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: not to my recollection...

2010-09-13T01:09:47  <sigh> but that was a few days ago
2010-09-13T01:09:50  <rwa> yeah, it uses its own internal makefile and ignores yours
2010-09-13T01:10:02  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: compilation is not sandboxed. running a makefile would be a major security problem
2010-09-13T01:10:11  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: for that same reason, template haskell is disabled
2010-09-13T01:10:48  <Mathnerd314> would running a Cabalfile be a security problem?
2010-09-13T01:10:52  <bss03> Woohoo, reminds me on an employer I was at that was very picky about who they gave root.
2010-09-13T01:11:07  <jmcarthur> rwa: no makefile is used. it's just a python script
2010-09-13T01:11:08  <bss03> But, they'd give anyone the ability to submit jobs to the compile farm.
2010-09-13T01:11:25  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: yeah. you can have cabal call a makefile or whatever you want
2010-09-13T01:11:27  <rwa> jmcarthur: ok
2010-09-13T01:11:34  <bss03> The compile farm would use your Makefile to execute make AS root.
2010-09-13T01:11:38  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: in fact, Setup.hs is an arbitrary program

2010-09-13T01:18:55  <jmcarthur> i'm still hoping we can clean up the sandbox so we can allow binaries
2010-09-13T01:19:22  <jmcarthur> i *really* want to use GHC HEAD because i'm using vector and fusion is vastly improved in HEAD
2010-09-13T01:19:42  <jmcarthur> in fact, with 6.8.2, i might have to abandon vector
2010-09-13T01:19:46  <jmcarthur> don't remember if i had to do that last time

2010-09-13T02:30:15  <Cyndre> over commited
2010-09-13T02:30:33  <Cyndre> would be based on my ships/yourShips/airShips
2010-09-13T02:30:33  <Obeleh> less planets defended when more ships in the air
2010-09-13T02:30:52  <Cyndre> thems the words I needed, ty obeleh
2010-09-13T02:31:08  <Obeleh> but so far i havent used a limiter
2010-09-13T02:31:29  <Obeleh> im doing fine without
2010-09-13T02:31:42  <sigh> I jut make sure my planets have enough ships to defend themselves... after that I care how many ships are launched
2010-09-13T02:31:49  <Cyndre> was thinking of waiting 1 turn, and seeing if any of the first turn planets the opponent went after would be easy to snag for planetGrowth + 1 ships
2010-09-13T02:32:14  <sigh> that's a good strategy if the starting planets are close, i think
2010-09-13T02:32:19  <sigh> not if they are far
2010-09-13T02:32:33  <Cyndre> well it would be based on if you could get to the enemyFleets Destination Planet first
2010-09-13T02:32:58  <Cyndre> er 1 turn after they land
2010-09-13T02:33:40  <sigh> oh i see what you mean, if the enemy was silly enoguh to attack neutrals which were closer to you?
2010-09-13T02:34:01  <AlliedEnvy> Wow, the canvas visualizer is so much faster and non-laggy now, when did that happen?

2010-09-13T02:35:56  <Baphomet> guys anyone want to give me a really simple explanation of how to make multiple planets send fleets in a single turn?
2010-09-13T02:36:35  <sigh> call IssueOrder multiple times
2010-09-13T02:37:48  <Baphomet> so, have a loop around IssueOrder with the code to find source inside the loop?
2010-09-13T02:38:45  <sigh> you call IssueOrder once for each fleet you want to send, yes
2010-09-13T02:39:34  <sigh> you can call it as many times as you want (so long as the fleets are valid)

2010-09-13T02:43:59  <Cyndre> I just made a simple dictionary to track how many ships each planet have so I dont send to many
2010-09-13T02:45:09  <Cyndre> and have a command that makes sure everything is valid and safe and removes the ships and issues the order

2010-09-13T03:20:20  <antimatroid> and i really liked the idea about (pseudo) removing the maximum turns before game is called off, and rather incrementally reduce the band of difference between players number of ships required before a player gets the win if they have a greater difference than the current band, once that gets to a certain point (not zero, as equal matches could presumably cycle on who has the most ships in a particular turn) then the ga
2010-09-13T03:23:24  <dstufft> i'd like to see how the games play differently if you use speed chess style timing instead of 1s per turn
2010-09-13T03:23:44  <dstufft> with unlimited amounts of turns
2010-09-13T03:23:51  <antimatroid> yeah, 0.1 secnds or something would be cool
2010-09-13T03:23:55  <dstufft> no

2010-09-13T03:24:00  <dstufft> speed chess is
2010-09-13T03:24:04  <dstufft> you get 15 minutes TOTAL
2010-09-13T03:24:16  <dstufft> if you take 1 minute per turn, well then you only get 15 turns
2010-09-13T03:24:37  <antimatroid> i don't think that's really work very well for this
2010-09-13T03:24:51  <sigh> hey, if we are talking about interesting variants, how about no time limits... you can fire of commands at anytime

2010-09-13T03:25:35  <antimatroid> would be pretty cool
2010-09-13T03:25:37  <dstufft> antimatroid: sure it would, you'd have to balance between heavy routines and light routines
2010-09-13T03:25:53  <antimatroid> i like that idea actually
2010-09-13T03:25:54  <dstufft> aka if you can do a lot of math, but get it done in 15 turns, then take 1 minute a turn
2010-09-13T03:26:06  <antimatroid> that should really be how it's done actually
2010-09-13T03:26:30  <antimatroid> although would that increase or decrease the speed advantage for us c++ians?
2010-09-13T03:26:37  <antimatroid> i think it would increase it yeah?
2010-09-13T03:27:04  <dstufft> probably increase it
2010-09-13T03:27:21  <antimatroid> also, did i read right in that we do get 3 seconds for first move again?
2010-09-13T03:27:40  <dstufft> currently with 1second per turn, you get the most "Bang for buck" by trying to toe as closely to the 1 second line as possible

2010-09-13T03:33:23  <antimatroid> is it still legal to send fleets to the planet it started at?
2010-09-13T03:33:36  <sigh> you'd easily have tens of thousands of fleets on such a map
2010-09-13T03:34:06  <antimatroid> you also have issues in that numbers have to remain small enough for 32 bit integers
2010-09-13T03:34:07  <Zaphus> dstufft:  you can't go changing the rules that drastically at the final stages, the rules are basically set now whether they like it or not, there isnt much room for changing them if they want to keep people happy
2010-09-13T03:34:23  <sigh> antimatroid: game spec says no

2010-09-13T03:56:04  <samulihs> yep, I've seen the site's been quite flake here and there. I guess you didn't expect that many people would be interest in the challenge and the infra doesn't take the load
2010-09-13T03:56:30  <antimatroid> i hope we get at least a few hundred decent quality bots

2010-09-13T03:57:03  <dstufft> sometimes some of the bots take the system down for one reason or another

2010-09-13T03:57:39  <samulihs> it's always java that's screwing things up :)

2010-09-13T04:04:22  <EvGenius> I glanced through the sources of the site. why don't you cache stuff like rankings and profile info?
2010-09-13T04:04:42  <TapewormGalactos> xnew = xold + cos angle * (length of line * percentage)
2010-09-13T04:05:00  <dstufft> EvGenius: that's going to be happening

2010-09-13T04:05:12  <greghaynes> TapewormGalactos: xnew and xold are what?
2010-09-13T04:05:20  <otherAntimatroid> greghaynes: you can think of it as a weighted average between the two endpoints of the line
2010-09-13T04:06:20  <greghaynes> Ah, I get it
2010-09-13T04:06:26  <EvGenius> dstufft: OK, I hope that would improve performance
2010-09-13T04:06:34  <otherAntimatroid> ie: if the line is (xa,ya) to (xb,yb) then xnew = xa*percentage/100 + xb*(100-percentage)/100
2010-09-13T04:06:37  <TapewormGalactos> xold is the x coordinate of one of your two points
2010-09-13T04:06:57  <dstufft> EvGenius: yea it would help, one big issue atm is that we are getting lock contentions on the read/writes
2010-09-13T04:07:09  <dstufft> so i think we'll need to switch some of the tables to innodb

2010-09-13T04:16:43  <Obeleh> use a for loop or an iterator
2010-09-13T04:16:58  <edcba> isn't there some reduce function ?
2010-09-13T04:17:01  <Baphomet> i just cant get it assigned to a variable
2010-09-13T04:17:37  <greghaynes> Ah, total = 0;for(vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it!= v.end(); ++it) total += *it;
2010-09-13T04:18:02  <Obeleh> you should declare a variable first and inside the for loop do variable += curValue
2010-09-13T04:18:15  <Baphomet> Obeleh thats what im trying to do
2010-09-13T04:18:43  <greghaynes> replace v with the name of your vector...that should do it
2010-09-13T04:18:49  <Obeleh> should work tho
2010-09-13T04:19:39  <EvGenius> that's why PHP is easier that STL in C++: $total = array_sum ($v); :)
2010-09-13T04:20:27  <greghaynes> ...int vector_sum(vecotr<int> &v) {total = 0;for(vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it!= v.end(); ++it) total += *it; return total;}
2010-09-13T04:20:33  <greghaynes> Now its not
2010-09-13T04:20:45  <antimatroid> i just use for(int i=0; i<vector.size(); i++) whatever
2010-09-13T04:20:56  <antimatroid> v[i] works
2010-09-13T04:21:04  <antimatroid> i fucking love vectors
2010-09-13T04:21:16  <greghaynes> eh, I love Qt
2010-09-13T04:21:22  <EvGenius> the thing is, you need to write a hundred of such functions to make STL as easy as PHP :)

2010-09-13T04:37:10  <greghaynes> Qt!
2010-09-13T04:37:12  <greghaynes> And only Qt!
2010-09-13T04:38:15  <antimatroid> okay, we tried both gtk and wxwidgets, they were both awful
2010-09-13T04:38:26  <greghaynes> Yes, you need Qt
2010-09-13T04:38:36  <greghaynes> Those two are aweful
2010-09-13T04:39:14  <greghaynes> There is a bit of a learning curve with signals / slots if youre not used to that sort of design pattern, it really is a better way though

2010-09-13T05:09:32  <soswow> Hi to all. Is there will be some way to tell reason of winning/loosing in each game? For example when there is "1 of 1 turns" situation. Does this question looks stupid? =)
2010-09-13T05:10:08  <Naktibalda> error in bot probably
2010-09-13T05:10:13  <AJC> soswow: yeah, it's hard to know if it was a server bug or a bot committing suicide.
2010-09-13T05:12:46  <soswow> AJC: what do you mean? Is it right now hard to tell or it's hard to determine in the game engine?

2010-09-13T05:14:35  <AJC> soswow: are you using your entire 1s budget?
2010-09-13T05:15:04  <soswow> AJC: Yeah, I talk exactly about it. There should be some verdict.

2010-09-13T05:16:00  <AJC> soswow: how do you make sure you don't take more than 1s?
2010-09-13T05:16:22  <soswow> On first turn? it's hard to imagine ...
2010-09-13T05:16:56  <AJC> soswow: it's your code ;-)
2010-09-13T05:17:07  <bartwe_> next up, rolling the tcp code into the binary itself and setup profiling
2010-09-13T05:18:40  <soswow> AJC: Right! And I can definitely say, that on first turn I don't count factorial of 10^10
2010-09-13T05:19:31  <soswow> Maybe there something with package. What if I don't add something in my zip?
2010-09-13T05:19:44  <Zaphus> soswow: I have a forum post about it, several of the top bots have also succumbed to this, sometimes both bots at the same time - hopefully a way of knowing what happened will be added to the website in teh near future

2010-09-13T06:18:07  <aerique> danielvf: alright, thanks
2010-09-13T06:18:19  <edcba> supporting php...
2010-09-13T06:18:36  <Naktibalda> it's easy to add support
2010-09-13T06:18:49  <edcba> i guess you could do almost same client for lisp/ocaml/scheme

2010-09-13T06:28:42  <edcba> last time i checked it was faster...
2010-09-13T06:28:47  <caytchen> its slow and has all those subtle api differences
2010-09-13T06:28:56  <phreeza> i'm thinking of maybe building an ai that does extensive search, breaking the time limit, just to see how it plays and maybe derive some heursitics
2010-09-13T06:28:58  <edcba> but it was mono ppl giving me info :)
2010-09-13T06:29:01  <phreeza> anyone trying that?
2010-09-13T06:29:27  <edcba> phreeza: i'll do that
2010-09-13T06:30:13  <edcba> but right now i'm looking how exactly
2010-09-13T06:30:35  <phreeza> alberts c++ engine will probably speed that up quite a bit
2010-09-13T06:30:45  <bartwe_> 0edcba: the stable mono version you see in contests like this or on debian, etc. is slow as hell
2010-09-13T06:30:50  <edcba> since you can't really bruteforce every movement with all different amount of ships each turn
2010-09-13T06:31:56  <phreeza> edcba: thats true, i was thinking more like using a heursitic to do the tactics of how exactly to attack/defend planets, and brute forcing which ones to use that heurstic on
2010-09-13T06:32:34  <phreeza> still 2^23 choices per turn, but many can be eliminated as impossible maybe
2010-09-13T06:32:50  <edcba> 2^23 only ??
2010-09-13T06:33:07  <phreeza> well if you choose to defend or attack a planet or not
2010-09-13T06:33:15  <phreeza> one binary decision per planet
2010-09-13T06:33:30  <phreeza> very simplistic but at least that seems feasible
2010-09-13T06:33:30  <edcba> the problem is that it isn't binary :)
2010-09-13T06:34:17  <phreeza> no but for the details i was thinking of using a heuristic... like if i attack a planet it sends just the right amount from the closest planets i own, or something like that
2010-09-13T06:34:27  <bartwe_> the number of ways to attack 10 planets with 100 units in extremely complex enough
2010-09-13T06:34:27  <edcba> ok

2010-09-13T06:52:13  <soswow> edcba: I just wanted to ask from the first hands about currency situation or ask them to keep us (public) in touch with news, activities, changes, future plans itc. I can't find some constant place, where I can find such info.
2010-09-13T06:52:34  <danielvf> I'm an organizer
2010-09-13T06:52:35  <edcba> the forum ?
2010-09-13T06:52:51  <danielvf> I think we've got the site stability fixed
2010-09-13T06:52:58  <danielvf> Server super happy this morning
2010-09-13T06:53:00  <soswow> Yeah, I don't see there much activity from them ... -\
2010-09-13T06:53:06  <danielvf> Games are playing again.
2010-09-13T06:53:11  <soswow> danielvf: Nice!
2010-09-13T06:53:19  <edcba> all seems nice
2010-09-13T06:53:22  <danielvf> We'll be working on the submissions next
2010-09-13T06:53:36  <edcba> and the bugs in starter packs !? :)
2010-09-13T06:53:37  <danielvf> (some of them don't seem to go through right away)
2010-09-13T06:53:59  <danielvf> After that, it's time to add more languages
2010-09-13T06:54:33  <soswow> danielvf: Is there will be some kind of status/verdict for each game? Like "time out" or "illegal turn by player #"
2010-09-13T06:54:53  <EvGenius> 14 games per minute is not a very fast speed
2010-09-13T06:55:23  <soswow> danielvf: for better understanding of loosing in case of "1 of 1 turns" situation
2010-09-13T06:55:45  <soswow> danielvf: there are post on forum about it as well
2010-09-13T06:56:07  <delt0r___> EvGenius: if you get up to 1 second per turn and up to 200 turns... then 14 games a sec sounds fast
2010-09-13T06:56:16  <danielvf> soswow: Yes, that's an issue. Will probably come after getting the new languages up.
2010-09-13T06:56:25  <danielvf> delt0r___: right
2010-09-13T06:56:35  <Naktibalda> soswow: did you create an issue?
2010-09-13T06:56:36  <danielvf> 14 games a minute
2010-09-13T06:56:41  <danielvf> but still fast
2010-09-13T06:57:40  <delt0r___> danielvf: How is java "sand boxed" ? with Systrace?
2010-09-13T06:57:46  <antimatroid> Palmik: I have to read in every fleet each turn anyway, so I just add new ones (including my own) to my fleets, also make sure you update your planet information each turn because planets might be distanced 1 apart

2010-09-13T07:04:00  <Zaphus> Hey guys, anyone know where to find the source for Showgame.java ?   I can't see it in the trunk at code.google.com
2010-09-13T07:04:32  <soswow> Zaphus: folder "viz"
2010-09-13T07:04:46  <Zaphus> ahh, thanks.
2010-09-13T07:05:18  <soswow> Zaphus: see "MAkefile" there for more info how ShowGame and PlayGame are made
2010-09-13T07:05:27  <Palmik> Also I wonder whether it would be better passing around pointers to Planets and Fleets or values... by passing pointers, it should have much smaller memory footprint, also you would not have to copy whole objects every time you filter them or something

2010-09-13T07:06:56  <delt0r___> Zaphus: I was thinking of doing this for the java TCP
2010-09-13T07:07:47  <delt0r___> It wouldn't be hard to write it better than the applet they have (serious performance issues)
2010-09-13T07:07:58  <Zaphus> delt0r___ : cool.   If there was some way to run the canvas visuallizer locally, that would do it too - no idea how that works though
2010-09-13T07:09:14  <delt0r___> well right now the java is broken on the ranking server... And i am not doing anything else....
2010-09-13T07:09:36  <Zaphus> delt0r___ FTW !
2010-09-13T07:10:00  <soswow> Zaphus: did you mean WTF? =)
2010-09-13T07:11:03  <delt0r___> I will work on something this afternoon.. But what did you really want Zaphus --real time local playgame with visuals.. or TCP with visuals?

2010-09-13T07:13:03  <dhartmei> it's backwards compatible, as long as you don't use passwords, nothing changes. once you set a password, you have to supply it every time.
2010-09-13T07:13:35  <ratatata> dhartmei: so if someone sets a pw to your name before, you're pretty much screwed? :)
2010-09-13T07:13:36  <dhartmei> soswow: it's completely unofficial, but works quite well :)

2010-09-13T07:14:49  <delt0r___> sure its not perfect --but its not bad

2010-09-13T07:15:48  <soswow> Zaphus: One thing, that I change after first opening of ShowGame - I changed speed of playing and get it out into command line parameter

2010-09-13T08:06:07  <dhartmei> edcba: fixed in the new version of tcp.c :)
2010-09-13T08:06:15  <edcba> fast

2010-09-13T08:10:27  <kuwabara> hi, there
2010-09-13T08:10:38  <dhartmei> the history? 6 hours
2010-09-13T08:10:57  <kuwabara> there is still no message on the forums about the java clients all loosing their games on first turn. Any more news here ?
2010-09-13T08:10:58  <edcba> is there a 1s timeout in tcpserver too ?
2010-09-13T08:11:06  <dhartmei> edcba: 3s
2010-09-13T08:11:21  <dstufft> kuwabara: is your bot one of the affected?
2010-09-13T08:11:25  <edcba> kuwabara: did you use latest PlayGame and ShowGame jars ?
2010-09-13T08:11:41  <AJC> are the latest available in a repository?
2010-09-13T08:11:47  <AJC> so much easier to sync :-)
2010-09-13T08:12:01  <Baphomet> is this tcp thing for uber programmers who are too paranoid to let their code leave their pc? if so, im sniffing your packets are stealn ur codez
2010-09-13T08:12:16  <edcba> Baphomet: of course
2010-09-13T08:12:19  <kuwabara> dstufft: yes.
2010-09-13T08:12:21  <Baphomet> :p
2010-09-13T08:12:33  <dstufft> kuwabara: how long has this been happening?
2010-09-13T08:12:43  <kuwabara> dstufft, edcba: look at the top java bots, they are all loosing 100% of their games.
2010-09-13T08:12:53  <edcba> Baphomet: it's also a way for the server not having to trust any provided code
2010-09-13T08:13:03  <edcba> and you can program in any languages
2010-09-13T08:13:04  <kuwabara> it started this morning, when the games restarted.
2010-09-13T08:13:24  <dstufft> kuwabara: can you tell me how much memory and cputime your bot uses
2010-09-13T08:13:24  <edcba> that just means java is shit ;)
2010-09-13T08:13:40  <dstufft> on a local run
2010-09-13T08:14:06  <kuwabara> dstufft: sorry, no. I'm not at home.
2010-09-13T08:14:15  <dstufft> kuwabara: ok
2010-09-13T08:15:09  <dstufft> well cputime shouldn't matter if its first turn
2010-09-13T08:15:19  <kuwabara> the best ranked java bots: Molehill, luismi, OkirFun, Phate666 were all in the top 10 yesterday, and they have lost all of their games on sept 13.
2010-09-13T08:15:51  <Palmik> Wow, my bot played 8 games in single hour, I guess I!m lucky :)
2010-09-13T08:15:56  <dstufft> we added some limits to have the kernel kill run away bot procceses, but cputime is like 10 minutes before the kernel kills it
2010-09-13T08:15:57  <Baphomet> is it sad that nearly all the bots i make struggle to beat the default one?
2010-09-13T08:16:05  <dstufft> and ram is like 196000kb

2010-09-13T08:17:55  <edcba> computed ?
2010-09-13T08:18:14  <kuwabara> a java app doing nothing uses about 26Mb on my host, but VSZ is at 789Mb

2010-09-13T08:19:01  <kuwabara> so, if VSZ is checked against 196Mb, there is no way a java bot can enter the aichallenge anymore
2010-09-13T08:19:25  *** danielvf <danielvf!~dvf@67-197-181-252.dyn.comporium.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-13T08:21:06  <kuwabara> look at my profile, the change in rules is quite visible: http://www.ai-contest.com/profile_games.php?user_id=6391
2010-09-13T08:21:13  <dstufft> kuwabara: Address Space, and jesus a javaapp is really got a vsz of 789?
2010-09-13T08:21:44  <kuwabara> dstufft: yes, because of all the .so it's linked against. address space is VSZ indeed.
2010-09-13T08:21:53  <dstufft> i'll modify the memory limits then
2010-09-13T08:21:55  <AJC> kuwabara: what changed?
2010-09-13T08:22:13  <dstufft> actually i'll probably just remove them, atleast for now
2010-09-13T08:22:54  <kuwabara> AJC: address space is limited to 196Mb, but java needs a 700+Mb address space
2010-09-13T08:22:56  <Palmik> So I guess that is why I jumped in rankings :/
2010-09-13T08:23:08  <dstufft> kuwabara: not counting any battles currently in progess, memory limits are now gone
2010-09-13T08:23:15  <kuwabara> ok
2010-09-13T08:23:20  <kuwabara> dstufft: thanks
2010-09-13T08:23:25  <dstufft> if java bots start winning again we'll know that was the issue
2010-09-13T08:23:48  <dstufft> sorry about that, I don't deal with java at all and didn't realize it needed 700+mb address space
2010-09-13T08:23:49  <AJC> kuwabara: address space not being the same as actual memory usage?  I don't understand Java... that's weird.
2010-09-13T08:24:08  <Palmik> This was a close one :D http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4452689
2010-09-13T08:24:21  <bartwe_> ooh, top spot, hope deepblue doesn't wake up
2010-09-13T08:24:41  <kuwabara> AJC: when you map a shared library, it enters your address space, but it doesn't "spend" more memory if the library was already mapped by another process
2010-09-13T08:24:54  <bartwe_> kuwa: untrue
2010-09-13T08:25:02  <bartwe_> kuwa: relocations happen, alot

2010-09-13T08:31:38  <Zaphus> Whats a reasonable time to wait for a new upload to show up in 'submissions' before trying again ?   the webpage says 10 minutes, is that OK
2010-09-13T08:31:41  <dstufft> that were chewing up ram and cpu while not playing any games
2010-09-13T08:31:52  <bartwe_> AJC: that and some of the stronger bots are offline ;P
2010-09-13T08:31:59  <Maxicube> Mainly coz I'm on Linux.
2010-09-13T08:32:13  <AJC> bartwe_: do the stronger bots also use some kind of max flight time minimization?

2010-09-13T08:34:51  <kuwabara> dstufft: I mean: are all games taken into account for the rankings, on only the last ones (in which case, the losses will disapear with time)
2010-09-13T08:35:36  <Palmik> all games
2010-09-13T08:35:36  <dstufft> kuwabara: I don't know the ranking algo that well, but i think it will take the losses into account until you upload them
2010-09-13T08:35:47  <ratatata> kuwabara: all previous game records disappear upon re-upload afair.. but submission has been absent the past 2 hours

2010-09-13T08:35:53  <Palmik> because your rating is changed verytime you win /lose

2010-09-13T08:48:24  <dstufft> lemme see
2010-09-13T08:48:33  <Zaphus> ah, ok, may be in a queue ?
2010-09-13T08:48:36  <EvGenius> dstufft: can you check mine please? 4008 evgenius
2010-09-13T08:49:49  <kuwabara> same for me, latest submission doesn't appear, but he desn't need to investigate all cases. Once the problem is identified for Zaphus, he can fix it for everybody.

2010-09-13T08:53:36  <tobiassjosten> I can't get the TCP-connection working. It's compiled and I can run it but I'm not sure how to use it with my Python bot. Any pointers?
2010-09-13T08:53:45  <dstufft> ok
2010-09-13T08:53:49  <dstufft> found the problem
2010-09-13T08:53:52  <dstufft> time to fix it
2010-09-13T08:53:59  <tobiassjosten> I've made it executable and am trying with: ./tcp 213.3.30.106 9999 username -p password ./MyBot.py
2010-09-13T08:54:23  <tobiassjosten> But that wont work. ": No such file or directory" and "command terminated with exit status 127".
2010-09-13T08:54:35  <EvGenius> tobiassjosten: you don't need to type your pass
2010-09-13T08:55:51  <tobiassjosten> EvGenius: Ah, thanks. Though I'm still unable to run my bot. :(
2010-09-13T08:56:36  <EvGenius> and I think instead of ./MyBot.py you should type the full command line with the interpreter
2010-09-13T08:56:42  <RainCT> tobiassjosten: does MyBot.py have "#! /usr/bin/python" in the first line?

2010-09-13T08:57:58  <tobiassjosten> RainCT: Yeah. /usr/bin/env though.
2010-09-13T08:58:45  <RainCT> tobiassjosten: Dunno then. I ended up hardcoding the interpreter & file name in tcp.c
2010-09-13T08:59:26  <tobiassjosten> RainCT: Ah. Care to share that? :)
2010-09-13T09:00:10  <dstufft> ok
2010-09-13T09:00:14  <dstufft> sort of fixed it
2010-09-13T09:00:27  <dstufft> it's processing the backlog now
2010-09-13T09:00:32  <dstufft> theres like 900 things to compile
2010-09-13T09:00:33  <dstufft> lol
2010-09-13T09:00:50  <kuwabara> 900 for 700 users ?
2010-09-13T09:00:54  <Zaphus> lots of people multiple times
2010-09-13T09:01:05  <kuwabara> maybe you could remove the duplicates ?
2010-09-13T09:01:08  <Vi0> yeah just for trying
2010-09-13T09:01:14  <Zaphus> the webpage says resubmit in 10 minutes if it doesnt show - thats bad thing to suggest to people!
2010-09-13T09:01:22  <EvGenius> dstufft: finally! thank you
2010-09-13T09:01:25  <AJC> Zaphus: hehe, good point.
2010-09-13T09:02:29  <Zaphus> but hey, if it's 1 minute per compile, thats only...  15 hours :-)    hopefully it's only a few seconds each compile

2010-09-13T09:03:00  <RainCT> tobiassjosten: I don't have it here, and it looks like the tcp.c file on the web has been changed. But it was something like execv(argv[0], args) where args is an array with {"python", "MyBot.py", NULL}  (in my case also "--log", "output.log" before the NULL)
2010-09-13T09:03:31  *** ermau is now known as ermau|work
2010-09-13T09:03:48  <ratatata> tobiassjosten: to run on the TCP server, make a wrapper script calling "python path-to/MyBoy.py"... then call it as ./tcp <blabla> ./ScriptName
2010-09-13T09:05:10  <tobiassjosten> RainCT, ratatata: Sounds like two good suggestions, I'll try them. Thanks!

2010-09-13T09:25:26  <delt0r> thanks dstufft
2010-09-13T09:26:30  <dstufft> delt0r: i implemented memory limits to prevent bots from running rampant which happened every once in awhile, and was one of the issues bringing the server down
2010-09-13T09:26:44  <delt0r> dstufft, Good idea
2010-09-13T09:26:46  <dstufft> except i don't use java, and didn't realize java had an AS of 700+mb
2010-09-13T09:27:02  <delt0r> What is the new limit
2010-09-13T09:27:06  <dstufft> so limiting AS to 196M was wrecking java bots
2010-09-13T09:27:12  <delt0r> I am under 64meg at the moment
2010-09-13T09:27:26  <dstufft> atm i just removed it (there is still a 10 minute cpu time limit though)
2010-09-13T09:27:27  <kuwabara> delt0r: of RSS certainly, but not of AS
2010-09-13T09:27:39  <dstufft> i'll probably switch it to 196MB of RSS

2010-09-13T09:28:31  <dstufft> AS is address space, the entire amount of possible ram for a process basically
2010-09-13T09:28:35  <dstufft> including any shared libraries
2010-09-13T09:28:54  <amstan> cool, yesterday was a new record for the forums
2010-09-13T09:29:04  <dstufft> Java apparently links in 700+mb of shared libraries, that is shared among processes basically

2010-09-13T09:29:54  <delt0r> amstan, Right. Yes java is well known for using everything even when you need nothing
2010-09-13T09:30:03  <delt0r> pros and cons i guess
2010-09-13T09:30:10  <amstan> hmm?
2010-09-13T09:30:18  <amstan> oh.. yeah
2010-09-13T09:30:30  <amstan> except you can't share such memory in a sandbox
2010-09-13T09:30:38  <delt0r> ahh
2010-09-13T09:30:53  <delt0r> So what about using java's own sandbox?
2010-09-13T09:30:55  <dstufft> that and the compile daemon was throwing an exception every time it tried to process a submission (got stuck on one particular submission over and over)
2010-09-13T09:31:08  <dstufft> fixed that, so we are compiling again
2010-09-13T09:31:15  <dstufft> but going through the backlog of submissions
2010-09-13T09:32:04  <delt0r> Is it really realistic to get through all that backlog? -- i mean the comp doesn't run much longer
2010-09-13T09:32:21  <dstufft> the comp runs for 3 months more
2010-09-13T09:32:30  <dstufft> and the backlog was 900 some a bit ago
2010-09-13T09:32:33  <dstufft> it's steadily decreasing
2010-09-13T09:32:38  <delt0r> oh... Perhaps i got all the dates wrong
2010-09-13T09:32:50  * delt0r feels sheepish
2010-09-13T09:32:59  <dstufft> 200 items in the last 30 minutes
2010-09-13T09:33:02  <dstufft> about
2010-09-13T09:33:15  <delt0r> so shall i add my java sand box one ;)
2010-09-13T09:33:51  <amstan> delt0r: we can't have a sandbox for each of our languages
2010-09-13T09:33:53  <amstan> that would be insane
2010-09-13T09:34:10  <delt0r> but its just a command line argument
2010-09-13T09:34:25  <delt0r> then everything that jvm runs will be "sandboxed"
2010-09-13T09:34:27  <amstan> then we have to unsandbox it from our normal sandbox..
2010-09-13T09:34:38  <delt0r> good point
2010-09-13T09:35:21  <amstan> not to mention that it'll ruin the decentralization thingy
2010-09-13T09:38:49  <delt0r> amstan, So are you using systrace for the sandboxing? if so is there still a java performance issue with that?
2010-09-13T09:40:28  <Ported_> yay! my submissions from yesterday are showing up on the site. Thanks!
2010-09-13T09:41:34  <dstufft> 450 int he backlog
2010-09-13T09:41:37  <dstufft> afk a bit
2010-09-13T09:41:48  <Ported_> does anyone know what kind of hardware everything runs on? is this a problem at the moment?
2010-09-13T09:42:07  <Ported_> i mean the infrastructure for running matches, compiling code etc.
2010-09-13T09:42:39  <delt0r> Ported_, I think from how busy it is --its going to be a problem for a little while--the diversity of support langs makes it hard
2010-09-13T09:43:44  <Ported_> delt0r: is it a matter of throwing more hardware at the problem though?
2010-09-13T09:44:29  <delt0r> Manpower too i guess... its run by a university group.. its not really their "day" job... but we got time...

2010-09-13T10:03:28  <bartwe_> hmz i guess i could capture neutrals from my most remote planets, to see if the enemy is going to steal, but i'd still lose the units

2010-09-13T10:10:08  * amstan feels like making a bot, and using it in the tcp tourny
2010-09-13T10:10:43  <bartwe_> amstan: try beating these two http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284385976|vortex.9|bartwe.5.1
2010-09-13T10:11:08  <amstan> bartwe_: which one of them?
2010-09-13T10:11:09  <amstan> oh..
2010-09-13T10:11:10  <amstan> them 2
2010-09-13T10:11:12  <amstan> ok
2010-09-13T10:11:20  <amstan> i'm gonna start with neural networks
2010-09-13T10:11:26  <bartwe_> really ?
2010-09-13T10:11:36  <Naktibalda> bartwe: are you developing your bot full time?
2010-09-13T10:11:48  <Naktibalda> 16h/day ?
2010-09-13T10:11:58  <AJC> only 16h?
2010-09-13T10:11:59  <AJC> hehe
2010-09-13T10:12:06  <bartwe_> i have never seen a neural net do any succefull gameplaying in a constest like this
2010-09-13T10:12:30  <bartwe_> nak: nah maybe 12 h yesterday, nothing so far, just watching, thinking of strategies
2010-09-13T10:12:31  <AJC> bartwe_: i think it could work as a function approximator for a heuristic or opponent model.
2010-09-13T10:13:01  <bartwe_> ajc: i don't see how you can reduce the game state to usefull scalar inputs
2010-09-13T10:13:29  <AJC> bartwe_: not the game, the value of planets or individual attacks.
2010-09-13T10:13:38  <bartwe_> critical things like distances or growthrate
2010-09-13T10:13:38  <AJC> the likelyhood of a planet being attacked based on its properties
2010-09-13T10:13:50  <bartwe_> ah that would be fun
2010-09-13T10:14:09  <amstan> ulope: which fork of yours is better?
2010-09-13T10:14:10  <bartwe_> i was thinking of a bayesian approach to generate possible future attacks
2010-09-13T10:14:14  <dstufft> good news
2010-09-13T10:14:17  <dstufft> the backlog is empty
2010-09-13T10:14:28  <kuwabara> great job, dstufft
2010-09-13T10:14:31  <dstufft> from now one your shit should get compiled relatively quickly
2010-09-13T10:15:18  <dstufft> well assuming it doesn't get stuck again
2010-09-13T10:15:22  <Ported_> dstufft: should bots that were in the backlog now be playing?
2010-09-13T10:15:31  <dstufft> I didnt actually fix the cause of the error, I just unjammed it

2010-09-13T10:21:05  <dstufft> we just proccessed 900 some submissions
2010-09-13T10:21:12  <dstufft> in the last hour or two
2010-09-13T10:21:13  <dstufft> or 3
2010-09-13T10:21:23  <dstufft> so a lot of bots are at 0 or only a few games atm
2010-09-13T10:21:52  <iPanda> i tryed to uppload about 30 times my bot, when server has been off :-[
2010-09-13T10:22:03  <rogue780_> It seems whenever it try to iterate through either my fleets or the enemy's fleets, it causes my not to timeout. I'm using Java.

2010-09-13T10:23:19  <dstufft> yea i thought about that
2010-09-13T10:23:24  <dstufft> but run.py is cross platform

2010-09-13T10:26:40  <danielvf> dstufft: I saw.
2010-09-13T10:26:52  <dstufft> so gotta port foward via ssh atm
2010-09-13T10:26:55  <danielvf> dstufft: it's serving the site?

2010-09-13T10:27:36  <dstufft> don't have them setup in the conf atm
2010-09-13T10:27:42  <dstufft> easy to add though
2010-09-13T10:27:44  <danielvf> iPanda: lol
2010-09-13T10:28:01  <danielvf> dstufft: Would you do that - I'd want it to be a drop in replacement
2010-09-13T10:28:19  <danielvf> I like nginex, just gotta test it well before we use it.
2010-09-13T10:29:04  <dstufft> danielvf: yea, well now that the proof of concept works, i want to get go ahead to get it running via www-data instead of my personal user, but still bound to non standard port
2010-09-13T10:29:10  <dstufft> i was going to do that then
2010-09-13T10:29:15  <danielvf> Okay
2010-09-13T10:29:21  <dstufft> + i didn't have access to my vps yesterday
2010-09-13T10:29:28  <dstufft> which has my nginx configs on it

2010-09-13T10:29:58  <danielvf> dstufft: Heh. I understand
2010-09-13T10:30:02  <rwa> a nice ui touch for the site would be to generate a queue of scheduled games, and display it.  Then people could see that they're at least in line to play, and see how the games are progressing.
2010-09-13T10:30:05  <ulope> amstan: most people seem to use some sort of wrapper around the PlayGame.jar call
2010-09-13T10:30:22  <ermau|work> rwa: Agreed
2010-09-13T10:30:40  <dstufft> rwa: atm that would require a rework of the tournament_manager
2010-09-13T10:30:43  <dstufft> i agree though
2010-09-13T10:31:35  <dstufft> theres a lot of rube goldberg style things going on atm

2010-09-13T11:16:21  <Naktibalda> actually, tutorial bot was stronger than my latest version
2010-09-13T11:16:35  * ermau|work had no problem defeating all of the sample bots
2010-09-13T11:17:03  <ermau|work> I already know this bot has most of it's calculations wrong so I'm not really surprised
2010-09-13T11:19:18  <ulope> ermau|work: Yeah I have that too, I find it surprising how "good" a bot with borked calculations can still play
2010-09-13T11:19:42  <amstan> ulope: ok.. so... which one is your main file? MyBot.py
2010-09-13T11:19:55  <ermau|work> ulope: Well I'm losing most games on the tcp server
2010-09-13T11:20:05  <ermau|work> ulope: But was winning basically every game on the real server
2010-09-13T11:20:48  <ermau|work> ulope: Most of the issues surround defending planets that will change owners before reinforcements arrive
2010-09-13T11:21:03  <ulope> amstan: Yes. Do you see Game(<ClassOfTheBot>) at the end of the file? Thats what actually starts the game
2010-09-13T11:21:31  <ulope> ermau|work: Or not taking the flight time into account correctly
2010-09-13T11:21:56  <ermau|work> How can you screw that up? Isn't it just GrowthRate * (Distance + 1) ?
2010-09-13T11:22:12  <edcba> ?
2010-09-13T11:22:26  <edcba> 1+distance*growthrate
2010-09-13T11:22:26  <Cyndre> how do you decide which planet is worth taking?
2010-09-13T11:22:37  <ermau|work> edcba: Same thing
2010-09-13T11:22:41  <caytchen> distance to all my other planets + _growth rate_
2010-09-13T11:22:45  <edcba> turn*growthrate > numships
2010-09-13T11:22:51  <caytchen> oh and ships of course but thats not too important
2010-09-13T11:23:09  <ulope> ermau|work: No thats not what i meant. But when sending a fleet from multiple sources each has to have its own adjusted number of ships, but then some don't have enough to actually usefully contribute to the flett..
2010-09-13T11:23:11  <amstan> ulope: what file?
2010-09-13T11:23:15  <Cyndre> you guys dont rank the individual planets and make sure you taking the next big one?
2010-09-13T11:23:24  <ermau|work> ulope: Ah, yeah, I do adjust for that
2010-09-13T11:23:26  <jmcarthur> bss03-AFK: haha, i have exactly the same line count that you reported last night
2010-09-13T11:23:31  <ulope> amstan: Look at stupidbot.py for example
2010-09-13T11:23:35  <Cyndre> next best one
2010-09-13T11:23:51  <amstan> ulope: so... if i understand this correctly, the root folder has example bots, the planetwars folder is a module to include that includes the api for the bot
2010-09-13T11:24:01  <jmcarthur> bss03-AFK: i think the code you pasted should be fast enough, but the only way to be sure is to benchmark
2010-09-13T11:24:02  <ulope> amstan: Right.

2010-09-13T11:40:00  <jmcarthur> it lays pressure on the target sooner, so your opponent can't move ships from there for as long
2010-09-13T11:40:21  <jmcarthur> but it's a tradeoff. you are also subjected to similar constraints by doing it
2010-09-13T11:40:35  <ermau|work> You also can reprioritize without having already spent all your forces
2010-09-13T11:40:43  <jmcarthur> no, that's not it
2010-09-13T11:40:56  <jmcarthur> if you weren't sending in streams in the first place, you would have had a lot more forces built up over time
2010-09-13T11:41:02  <jmcarthur> not doing anything
2010-09-13T11:41:08  <jmcarthur> so they would be even more available
2010-09-13T11:41:15  <caytchen> these streams we see are often just the result of turn based bots
2010-09-13T11:41:35  <caytchen> bots that basically completely reevaluate at each turn and then end up doing things twice

2010-09-13T11:41:58  <jmcarthur> not a very good reevaluation if it doesn't see the fleet it already sent
2010-09-13T11:42:01  <edcba> it's not a problem of stream
2010-09-13T11:42:07  <edcba> it's a problem of speed
2010-09-13T11:42:23  <rafsoaken> and of limited  production
2010-09-13T11:42:48  <jmcarthur> yeah streams equal to growth rate just means they *really* want to attack a planet but don't yet have the forces to do it
2010-09-13T11:42:59  <ratatata> caytchen: either that or bots that empty the planets
2010-09-13T11:43:11  <jmcarthur> and if the planet is growing as fast or faster than yours then you will never catch up, of course

2010-09-13T11:44:03  <ermau|work> Not really, you're negating ships

2010-09-13T11:44:35  <jmcarthur> expansion will usually trump mere pressure
2010-09-13T11:44:42  <jmcarthur> pressure is for endgame when all planets are taken
2010-09-13T11:44:42  <rogue780> does the planet distance = number of turns for a fleet to get from planet a to planet b?

2010-09-13T11:49:59  <caytchen> heh thats what mine does too.. it doesn't even track fleets because i'm too damn lazy
2010-09-13T11:50:23  <caytchen> thats also why it easily produces 20+ fleets in a few turns lol
2010-09-13T11:50:41  <caytchen> too bad the tcp server prunes old games or i could show you some of the more crazy games
2010-09-13T11:50:43  <pgpaskar_> I've noticed a lot of the bots constantly send out small fleets of 2-4 ships
2010-09-13T11:50:51  <pgpaskar_> Is there a theory behind that?
2010-09-13T11:50:56  <ermau|work> caytchen: I do track fleets, just not well enough yet
2010-09-13T11:51:06  <ermau|work> caytchen: Working on a new one from scratch
2010-09-13T11:51:31  <caytchen> same.. but i might need a new task approach, right now i'm just pulsing sub modules.
2010-09-13T11:51:37  <hellman> <pgpaskar_> maybe they send their growthrated ships

2010-09-13T11:52:32  <hellman> <pgpaskar_> i mean they send some amount and leave 10 ships, next turn they have 13, and they use the same algorithm to calculate a count of ships to send, and get again 3..
2010-09-13T11:52:59  <pgpaskar_> seems like some of them are wasted on the same planet when they could be colonizing others
2010-09-13T11:53:11  <pgpaskar_> then again i play like a human so I'm not sure how that strategy fits in to bot world :}
2010-09-13T11:53:36  <hellman> i think sometimes blocking one planet by another is useful
2010-09-13T11:53:42  <hellman> but dunno how to apply that :)

2010-09-13T12:04:25  <jmcarthur> just write to a file
2010-09-13T12:05:23  <jmcarthur> you could also try to capture the game states up to the point that you crash and arrange to send them manually to your bot one by one, separate from the engine, so you can see first hand what's happening

2010-09-13T12:20:35  <amstan> susu-magic: they're all on the main site, you could also check the forums, strategy section
2010-09-13T12:20:41  <susu-magic> maybe some more specific that general "AI programming in game development"
2010-09-13T12:20:54  <ulope> amstan: Cool. I didn't know one could add links to other repos in github
2010-09-13T12:21:09  <amstan> ulope: man git submodule
2010-09-13T12:21:27  <Baphomet> im pretty sure the bots dont do anything on their own
2010-09-13T12:21:52  <ratatata> caytchen: if you're referring to my 'dramatic moment', its just a moment of overpower where takeover is almost guaranteed.. but then again, my attacks have calculation errors and are not really predictive..
2010-09-13T12:21:52  <ulope> amstan: Ahh. Sure... I've never seen one on github tough
2010-09-13T12:22:10  <Naktibalda> Baphomet: pw.exe <enter> then paste a map
2010-09-13T12:22:11  <susu-magic> amstan: "Advanced Strategy Guide" is empty, and Strategy section on forums is almost empty
2010-09-13T12:22:12  <amstan> ulope: it's a git feature, github's just detecting that it's from them and linking it

2010-09-13T12:22:39  <ulope> amstan: Yeah I know. I was just saying that i have never seen it used on github before
2010-09-13T12:23:00  <jmcarthur> susu-magic: strategies for this game are probably very specific to this game. at least, i haven't seen much academic research on games like this
2010-09-13T12:23:03  <caytchen> susu-magic: classic game theory might not have obvious use cases here
2010-09-13T12:23:09  <jmcarthur> susu-magic: that's kind of the appeal to this game :D
2010-09-13T12:23:48  <caytchen> susu-magic: just do what everyone else does: build heuristics.
2010-09-13T12:24:08  <jmcarthur> susu-magic: some things could apply to "small" parts of your ai, but the "big" tactics are all up to you and probably won't be derived directly from existing research
2010-09-13T12:24:18  <susu-magic> okay
2010-09-13T12:24:27  <jmcarthur> i have to admit that my first attempt is going to be... kind of classical
2010-09-13T12:24:28  <susu-magic> thx
2010-09-13T12:24:37  <jmcarthur> but with a non-traditional application
2010-09-13T12:24:47  <jmcarthur> of the theory
2010-09-13T12:25:03  <jmcarthur> so it's still very experimental and may not (probably won't) work well
2010-09-13T12:25:22  <jmcarthur> but i figure we have a couple months this time instead of just one, so i might as well experiment more
2010-09-13T12:25:47  <ulope> amstan: I'm going to pull this into my repo when I get home from work
2010-09-13T12:25:48  <evgenius> heuristics rule. at least until I get to the part where actually good strategy is needed
2010-09-13T12:26:04  <jmcarthur> heuristics *should* be good strategy
2010-09-13T12:26:04  <Baphomet> ok well i have it running on its own (not by that method you said, it doesnt work) and yea it just seems to randomly stop after 30 turns :\
2010-09-13T12:26:09  <caytchen> well heuristics are pretty much good strategy
2010-09-13T12:26:30  <caytchen> they can easily beat most humans atleat in this game
2010-09-13T12:26:46  <jmcarthur> and that's unusual for heuristics

2010-09-13T12:28:28  <jmcarthur> hornairs: it's probably just agnostic to it (which means if gems isn't installed you just can't use those libs unless you include them in your zip, probably)

2010-09-13T12:39:31  <jmcarthur> personally i think beginners are better off with higher level languages than c++. c++, IMO, is for experienced OO programmers that need low level code for speed
2010-09-13T12:40:03  <Baphomet> my first language is c++ and i love it, everything else seems crappy and weak
2010-09-13T12:40:12  <jmcarthur> and in fact should only be learned after having used a higher level OO language *and* C first
2010-09-13T12:40:28  <jmcarthur> c++ was also one of my earlier languages, but i regret that
2010-09-13T12:40:29  <delt0r> jmcarthur, In my experience --even for experienced coders... speed is often over rated.
2010-09-13T12:40:34  <jmcarthur> delt0r: i agree
2010-09-13T12:40:37  <Naktibalda> Baphomet: isn't it the only language you know?
2010-09-13T12:40:58  <jmcarthur> delt0r: for for brute force algorithms or for (some) high end games, it's hard to beat C or C++
2010-09-13T12:41:01  <jmcarthur> *but for
2010-09-13T12:41:49  <delt0r> jmcarthur, I would not necessarily agree... but if you need a asm block of sse instructions... then C can rock
2010-09-13T12:41:56  <delt0r> and C++
2010-09-13T12:42:05  <jmcarthur> i'm not a c++ fan at all
2010-09-13T12:42:11  <Baphomet> Naktibalda: i would say i 'know' it too well, but i have some experance with it, more so that anything else
2010-09-13T12:42:18  <delt0r> But my work code is in java... and its 5x faster than the C code it replaces
2010-09-13T12:42:22  <jmcarthur> C is also good for non-speed reasons
2010-09-13T12:42:29  <jmcarthur> (linux kernel programming, for example)
2010-09-13T12:42:33  <delt0r> not that java all that high level
2010-09-13T12:42:42  <delt0r> jmcarthur, True

2010-09-13T12:44:00  <jmcarthur> but highly tuned java well rarely be on par with highly tuned c or c++
2010-09-13T12:44:25  <delt0r> with the java 6 and java 7 --it can be

2010-09-13T12:44:34  <delt0r> things
2010-09-13T12:44:42  <jmcarthur> and tuning java is also less obvious than tuning c/c++

2010-09-13T12:45:18  <jmcarthur> a similar argument applies to my language of choice
2010-09-13T12:45:27  <delt0r> exactly
2010-09-13T12:45:46  <antimatroid> alright, i have a new bot up, not sure if it's going to be better or worse

2010-09-13T12:45:54  <delt0r> I would claim all things being == java has about the same performance as C/C++

2010-09-13T12:49:50  <delt0r> good old ghc... I complied it back when 64bit was new for desktops... took a while
2010-09-13T12:49:56  <jmcarthur> it has a great optimizer, great parallelism primitives, a fast runtime, a built in time and heap profiler, all kinds of niceties
2010-09-13T12:50:00  <Baphomet> yet i havnt been able to fix this random crasing bug yet
2010-09-13T12:50:24  <jmcarthur> that's a long time ago...
2010-09-13T12:50:24  <delt0r> mietek, Error messages and that sort of thing.  even for ghc when i last used it
2010-09-13T12:50:25  <mietek> Compiling it does take a while, that's why there are binaries provided.
2010-09-13T12:50:39  <jmcarthur> i haven't had any problem with ghc error messages...
2010-09-13T12:51:04  <delt0r> I did --but that was a while ago... I still do with different scheme implementations...
2010-09-13T12:51:09  <jmcarthur> mietek: compiling it is faster than it used to be at least. or maybe i just have a faster machine :)
2010-09-13T12:51:18  <delt0r> you just can't assume that where it barfed is where the problem is
2010-09-13T12:51:35  <mietek> I can see how they could be difficult to understand for people new to the language.  They've been improved, though -- for example, if you attempt to use a language extension without specifying it, you'll get a helpful suggestion, etc.
2010-09-13T12:51:38  <Baphomet> http://pastebin.com/wUU8LxMN maybe someone can quickly see where i went wrong and why it keep crashing after <40 rounds no matter what i do. that is if you dont want to rip your eyes out after seeing my horrible code....

2010-09-13T12:51:42  <jmcarthur> delt0r: okay, i'm with you there, but that's only for the syntax errors
2010-09-13T12:51:48  <jmcarthur> the type errors are very clear, IMO
2010-09-13T12:52:11  <jmcarthur> and once you have learned why the syntax errors are reported the way they are, it's easy to correct anyway
2010-09-13T12:52:17  <delt0r> but my biggest problem is that I need others to be able to take over my code.
2010-09-13T12:52:27  <mietek> Baphomet: have you considered giving Python a try?
2010-09-13T12:52:32  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's why i haven't been able to use haskell much in the workplace yet

2010-09-13T13:25:57  <a1k0n> okay, we definitely need the tournament manager to do the +/- 10 rank thing
2010-09-13T13:26:14  <Palmik> what's that?
2010-09-13T13:26:32  <a1k0n> or even just form a long-tailed distribution with a shape parameter determined by the confidence interval output by bayeselo
2010-09-13T13:26:40  <a1k0n> Palmik: currently it's pitting everybody against everybody else, randomly
2010-09-13T13:27:05  <a1k0n> which means people in the top 10 are fighting, on average, people ranked halfway down the list, which adds very little information when they win

2010-09-13T13:27:39  <a1k0n> in fact information gain might be a good way to find matches
2010-09-13T13:27:44  <Palmik> yeah, well, +/- 10 would not be ideal imo, what if there is no such person? Why not just that the 10 above you, 10 under you and pick random from them?
2010-09-13T13:27:55  <a1k0n> that's what i mean
2010-09-13T13:28:03  <a1k0n> not +/- 10 elo points, +/- 10 ranks
2010-09-13T13:28:14  <Palmik> Ah, sorry, misread it
2010-09-13T13:28:33  <Zannick> is that still not in yet?
2010-09-13T13:28:35  <Zannick> geez
2010-09-13T13:28:40  <jmcarthur> i think it should be overlapping confidence intervals, not ranks

2010-09-13T13:29:33  <a1k0n> well, yes.  but i think there is value in getting the occasional wildly random match
2010-09-13T13:29:43  <jmcarthur> we could just throw those in
2010-09-13T13:29:51  <jmcarthur> +/- 10 ranks could mean local minima anyway
2010-09-13T13:29:57  <jmcarthur> so we'd still want the occasional random match
2010-09-13T13:30:01  <a1k0n> danielvf could probably get that going

2010-09-13T13:30:52  <jmcarthur> hmm, that could work
2010-09-13T13:31:19  <jmcarthur> but i still favor choosing which bots need to play more games based on confidence interval rather than on games played
2010-09-13T13:31:20  <a1k0n> cauchy, shape=(max confidence - min confidence / 4 or so)
2010-09-13T13:31:34  <Cyndre> why not x% of random match, x% of elho match, and x% of within 10 positions?
2010-09-13T13:31:42  <a1k0n> yeah, global information gain.
2010-09-13T13:31:46  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: we'd only need one of the latter two
2010-09-13T13:31:58  <Cyndre> true
2010-09-13T13:32:05  <a1k0n> as long as it's constrained not to give 10 games in a row to the same dude
2010-09-13T13:32:10  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i think the long tail + prioritize bots with wide confidence intervals would be a good balance

2010-09-13T13:45:15  <bartwe> not sure what to call the algorithm
2010-09-13T13:45:22  <jmcarthur> bartwe: the entire server situation is frankly a disaster
2010-09-13T13:45:34  <retybok> Frankly it's easier to simply program in c++, that way you don't have to worry too much about performance
2010-09-13T13:45:38  <bartwe> i pick a central planet, and then mark the shortest edge that can be marked from it and mark it
2010-09-13T13:45:52  <greghaynes> Call it "bartwe's fleet army of death"
2010-09-13T13:45:53  <jmcarthur> i really hope we manage to do a distributed tournament so we can loosen the, IMO, crippling constraints on the bots
2010-09-13T13:45:55  <a1k0n> and then keep doing that greedily?
2010-09-13T13:45:59  <retybok> (i mean for this challenge, not in general of course)
2010-09-13T13:46:03  <bartwe> retybok: except that c++ is not a language i know well
2010-09-13T13:46:14  <jmcarthur> retybok: i disagree
2010-09-13T13:46:21  <rogue780> a1k0n, bartwe your bots are pretty sweet
2010-09-13T13:46:25  <jmcarthur> any reasonable language makes it easy enough to bind to C anyway
2010-09-13T13:46:41  <a1k0n> bartwe: you probably reinvented prim's algorithm or kruskal's algorithm (they are very simple)
2010-09-13T13:46:42  <jmcarthur> and there exist languages that are both fast *and* have high levels of abstraction
2010-09-13T13:46:48  <jmcarthur> if you really need that speed
2010-09-13T13:46:50  <bartwe> there is some additional smartness in determining the numbers to send
2010-09-13T13:47:01  <bartwe> a1k0n: one min, checking it on wikipedia
2010-09-13T13:47:02  <jmcarthur> (and also have really good foreign function interfaces)
2010-09-13T13:47:20  <greghaynes> You can write fortran in any language
2010-09-13T13:47:50  <bartwe> a1k0n: yeah prim sounds about right
2010-09-13T13:47:54  <a1k0n> i was considering doing the same thing so was surprised to see it in your bot right after i thought of it
2010-09-13T13:47:55  <jmcarthur> greghaynes: well my point is that you can write fast enough code in any (reasonable) language, not that you can write fortran *style* in any language
2010-09-13T13:48:11  <bartwe> a1k0n: mind reading
2010-09-13T13:48:16  <greghaynes> Yea, mostly true
2010-09-13T13:48:29  <bartwe> a1k0n: actually it came about due to not wanting to have the fleets in flight for long times
2010-09-13T13:48:39  <a1k0n> right, less uncertainty in outcome
2010-09-13T13:48:39  <greghaynes> I mean, if you need a highly recursive algo you may kill yourself trying to get it to work quickly in pythin
2010-09-13T13:48:46  <jmcarthur> greghaynes: of course, i don't think that argument applies to, e.g., writing GA in ruby ;)
2010-09-13T13:49:02  <bartwe> i'll put tcpserver support into the binary and start profiling
2010-09-13T13:49:16  <jmcarthur> bartwe: into the binary?
2010-09-13T13:49:18  <a1k0n> and the ships can be reporposed more quickly
2010-09-13T13:49:19  <greghaynes> Use the tcpserver visualiser!
2010-09-13T13:49:30  <greghaynes> Its magical and in realtime
2010-09-13T13:49:38  <greghaynes> </shameless plug>
2010-09-13T13:49:44  <bartwe> greghaynes: :)
2010-09-13T13:49:50  <Palmik> Yay, that Prim's algorithm was invented by Czech :)
2010-09-13T13:49:58  <bartwe> greghaynes: in all honesty, i don't need realytime, i need unwind
2010-09-13T13:50:04  <Palmik> or found I should say
2010-09-13T13:50:11  <jmcarthur> i also thought about minimum spanning trees, but i didn't think it would work out so well
2010-09-13T13:50:14  <caytchen> i usually let it run a few games and then do a post mortem on the web interface..
2010-09-13T13:50:16  <jmcarthur> i was apparently wrong
2010-09-13T13:50:24  <rogue780> greghaynes, I could never get that to compile for windows
2010-09-13T13:50:30  <a1k0n> well, the argument could be made that if you're sending ships to your own planets you might as well take the shortest path
2010-09-13T13:50:34  <greghaynes> bartwe: It applies for the rest of us who like watching your algo stomp us in real time
2010-09-13T13:50:56  <bartwe> greghaynes: glad to be of service
2010-09-13T13:50:56  <greghaynes> rogue780: Ah, thanks for trying
2010-09-13T13:51:05  <jmcarthur> the shortest path in this game is almost always going to be directly to the target though, not through an intermediate
2010-09-13T13:51:13  <bartwe> greghaynes: if you want to see stomping
2010-09-13T13:51:17  <jmcarthur> that's why the results of this trick seem counterintuitive to me
2010-09-13T13:51:23  <bartwe> greghaynes: vortex.9 is killer
2010-09-13T13:51:49  <bartwe> jmcarthur: its about responding to changes
2010-09-13T13:52:03  <jmcarthur> i kind of suspect that the real benefit this has is that it protects your "front lines" very well
2010-09-13T13:52:05  <bartwe> jmcarthur: if my predictor was worth its salt i could use directer paths
2010-09-13T13:52:09  <greghaynes> wow, vortex.9 goes right for the throat

2010-09-13T13:55:14  <cherwin> The python starter package doesn't work correctly on *nix. You have to convert it with dos2unix.
2010-09-13T13:55:24  <bartwe> i guess i can stomp vortex by not moving first on neutrals
2010-09-13T13:55:30  <jmcarthur> cherwin: seriously? python scripts aren't agnostic to that?

2010-09-13T14:03:59  <caytchen> yeah, its a perfect match for this competetion... you want functional programming, and you want C#.
2010-09-13T14:04:03  <jmcarthur> or a specific case of the general idea of monad
2010-09-13T14:04:15  <jmcarthur> caytchen: python has list comps too, to be fair
2010-09-13T14:05:19  <bartwe> still, i got loads of arrays and forloops
2010-09-13T14:05:39  <jmcarthur> i'm using haskell vector library for that stuff :D
2010-09-13T14:05:42  <jmcarthur> really fast
2010-09-13T14:05:56  <jmcarthur> i just hope we aren't stuck with ghc 6.8.2 in the long run, or it's all for naught
2010-09-13T14:06:09  <bartwe> jmcarthur: geh .... mono .....
2010-09-13T14:06:18  <jmcarthur> bartwe: we share this boat
2010-09-13T14:06:27  <caytchen> nah, mono is far worse
2010-09-13T14:06:30  <bartwe> jmcarthur: better not rock it :)
2010-09-13T14:06:31  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-13T14:06:32  <caytchen> especially this old version of it
2010-09-13T14:06:39  <jmcarthur> ghc 6.8.2 is a cripple
2010-09-13T14:06:47  <ermau|work> Yeah, it's ancient
2010-09-13T14:06:52  <bartwe> sounds like the versions debian would ship
2010-09-13T14:07:04  <jmcarthur> debian actually has more up to date ghc
2010-09-13T14:07:07  <jmcarthur> far more up to date
2010-09-13T14:07:15  <bartwe> really, supprising
2010-09-13T14:07:24  <caytchen> so ubuntu is the new debian?
2010-09-13T14:07:52  <jmcarthur> this is an old version of ubuntu to be fair
2010-09-13T14:07:55  <ermau|work> This version of Mono only supports the .NET 2 set.. that was released Jan. 2006
2010-09-13T14:08:00  <jmcarthur> the next version of ubuntu i think will have ghc 6.12.3
2010-09-13T14:08:01  <ermau|work> It's a little out of date
2010-09-13T14:08:23  <jmcarthur> or maybe that's 6.12.1
2010-09-13T14:08:26  <jmcarthur> don't remember
2010-09-13T14:08:48  <jmcarthur> http://packages.debian.org/sid/ghc6
2010-09-13T14:08:50  <jmcarthur> 6.12.1
2010-09-13T14:08:52  <bartwe> ermau|work: 3.5 is fun and all, but contains nothing you need
2010-09-13T14:09:05  <bartwe> ermau|work: if you want horror, try java, without generics
2010-09-13T14:09:13  <bartwe> not in this contest ofcourse
2010-09-13T14:09:33  <Strepto> Kavish's bot looks interesting
2010-09-13T14:09:34  <ermau|work> Pfft
2010-09-13T14:09:39  <ermau|work> Java doesn't have generics, it just thinks it does
2010-09-13T14:09:42  <jmcarthur> okay, lenny still has only 6.8.2
2010-09-13T14:09:47  <caytchen> java is a different type of "twisted sick". they cripple themselves because its their philosophy.
2010-09-13T14:09:48  <jmcarthur> so nevermind
2010-09-13T14:09:50  <rogue780> What causes the game to timeout?  My bot is timing out randomly now and I can't figure out why
2010-09-13T14:10:05  <caytchen> rogue780: you fail to "go" in 1s
2010-09-13T14:10:16  <caytchen> on official, i think its 5s on tcp
2010-09-13T14:10:25  <bartwe> 3sec on tcp i heard
2010-09-13T14:10:35  <rogue780> i'm just doing local testing right now...so 1s?
2010-09-13T14:10:39  <jmcarthur> http://ai-contest.com/specification.php#bot-io
2010-09-13T14:10:50  <jmcarthur> 3 seconds on first turn, 1 second on subsequent turns
2010-09-13T14:10:52  <bartwe> i guess i could place a gateway on the frontend and force completion at .98 seconds
2010-09-13T14:11:05  * Janzert just realized there is a backward compatible way to give players the number of turns remaining in a game
2010-09-13T14:11:16  <jmcarthur> Janzert: please tell
2010-09-13T14:11:31  <jmcarthur> another communication channel?
2010-09-13T14:11:35  <jmcarthur> file io?
2010-09-13T14:11:43  <ermau|work> bartwe: Well, getting subsets without LINQ is a waste of coding time for me
2010-09-13T14:11:52  <jmcarthur> command argument, maybe?
2010-09-13T14:11:53  <Janzert> slightly ugly, but use a comment at the beginning of the game state
2010-09-13T14:12:01  <jmcarthur> oh that could work too
2010-09-13T14:12:04  <a1k0n> oh yeah, all existing code ignores comments
2010-09-13T14:12:14  <jmcarthur> i bet some bots will hate that, but it's technically part of the spec
2010-09-13T14:12:14  <ermau|work> bartwe: I already know I won't end up maxing out my time so I'm not really worried about that
2010-09-13T14:12:18  <Janzert> yep, and it's a two line change to engine.py
2010-09-13T14:12:19  <a1k0n> (except for those who rewrote the parser, like me)
2010-09-13T14:12:21  <Janzert> diff coming up
2010-09-13T14:12:31  <jmcarthur> my custom parser handles it properly, thank goodness
2010-09-13T14:12:33  <ermau|work> bartwe: Besides, the Mono upgrade will be inevitably faster
2010-09-13T14:12:51  <jmcarthur> Janzert: sweet! you are my hero now
2010-09-13T14:12:56  <a1k0n> actually come to think of it all lines not starting iwth 'g', 'F', or 'P' will be ignored so i'm good
2010-09-13T14:13:33  <bartwe> ermau|work: if you have loops in your loops, better not alloc loads of Enumerators and Enumerables
2010-09-13T14:13:38  <jmcarthur> this seriously would make my bot actually reliable
2010-09-13T14:13:59  <rogue780> hmm...maybe my file io is causing my timeout. every time I make a log entrey i open, write and close the file
2010-09-13T14:14:03  <ermau|work> bartwe: Why?
2010-09-13T14:14:07  <jmcarthur> currently my bot would crash if there is an extra turn beyond 200, and would probably do very badly if there is a turn limit < 200
2010-09-13T14:14:21  <a1k0n> rogue780: you can't write logs on the contest site
2010-09-13T14:14:22  <bartwe> ermau|work: GC is slow
2010-09-13T14:14:30  <bartwe> i should know, i wrote one
2010-09-13T14:14:33  <bartwe> ;p
2010-09-13T14:14:42  <jmcarthur> poor imperative languages and their slow GCs
2010-09-13T14:14:43  <rogue780> a1k0n, I am aware. I haven't submitted to the contest site. I'm still doing local testing
2010-09-13T14:14:43  <Janzert> here's the engine.py diff, I'll try to make a java diff and then submit it to the issue tracker

2010-09-13T14:15:00  <a1k0n> oh and it's still timing out?  i see.
2010-09-13T14:15:10  <ermau|work> bartwe: It's not that many enumer(ator|able)s
2010-09-13T14:15:18  <rogue780> a1k0n, as soon as I stopped logging things, it stopped timing out
2010-09-13T14:15:20  <jmcarthur> Janzert: come to think of it, we could include other things too, like timeout periods
2010-09-13T14:15:28  <ermau|work> bartwe: And besides, I'm not running against the time limit, my bot won't be smart enough for any of that
2010-09-13T14:15:29  <bartwe> ermau|work: geh, profile your ass off :)
2010-09-13T14:15:37  <jmcarthur> Janzert: such as saying 3 for the first turn and 1 for all others
2010-09-13T14:15:41  <Janzert> yep, any optional information could be done this way
2010-09-13T14:15:45  <jmcarthur> and if it changes we can just change that
2010-09-13T14:15:55  <bartwe> ermau|work: well my main contest entry is randomly getting kicked out, so i do need to shave these kinds of things off
2010-09-13T14:16:00  <jmcarthur> we could even say whether to use wall time or cpu time
2010-09-13T14:16:13  <ermau|work> bartwe: Well I understand, doesn't mean _I_ shouldn't get to use LINQ ;)
2010-09-13T14:16:26  <bartwe> ermau|work: sure, linq your ass off
2010-09-13T14:16:32  <ermau|work> bartwe: Like I said, I'm sure the newer version of Mono will be faster, should help you some
2010-09-13T14:16:38  <jmcarthur> Janzert: i do think perhaps that we should have a special denotation for these comments to say "hey this is some of this special information and not a normal comment"
2010-09-13T14:16:51  <jmcarthur> #: or something perhaps
2010-09-13T14:17:06  <Zannick> #!
2010-09-13T14:17:08  <Zannick> :P
2010-09-13T14:17:11  <jmcarthur> not #! :P
2010-09-13T14:17:57  <ermau|work> bartwe: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=101
2010-09-13T14:17:58  <jmcarthur> actually, since it's not officially spec, we should probably do key-value
2010-09-13T14:18:06  <jmcarthur> then as we add more we don't break things that are using it
2010-09-13T14:18:19  <Janzert> hmm, maybe just a common format to make parsing easier? Either the bot is expecting it and knows how to handle the comment or it should just ignore it.
2010-09-13T14:18:19  <jmcarthur> #! key value
2010-09-13T14:18:30  <Janzert> #$ key: value
2010-09-13T14:18:56  <Janzert> or # $ key: value
2010-09-13T14:19:01  <jmcarthur> i think it should just have a space between key and value since there is probably already code for that
2010-09-13T14:19:11  <Janzert> I seem to recall the python parser needed a space after the #
2010-09-13T14:19:15  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-13T14:19:37  <bartwe> ermau|work: i'm not waiting for magic upgrades

2010-09-13T14:20:12  <Janzert> the only thing is that limits no spaces in key
2010-09-13T14:20:25  <jmcarthur> i don't think we will need spaces in keys :P
2010-09-13T14:20:35  <ermau|work> bartwe: Can they see how many star an issue, to see demand?

2010-09-13T14:28:10  <jmcarthur> and let's not get started on my experiences with ubuntu at my last job. my coworkers decided that ubuntu simply hates me

2010-09-13T14:29:04  <jmcarthur> i'm talking two years at this job, and every time i set up an ubuntu machine (we did that a lot since we did kernel dev) it was fail
2010-09-13T14:29:08  <dstufft> i can't decide if i like ubuntu or debian more for a server
2010-09-13T14:29:12  <jmcarthur> which is why i felt justified in using arch there
2010-09-13T14:29:26  <dstufft> i used to strictly use debian
2010-09-13T14:29:44  <dstufft> but software versions made me start using ubuntu

2010-09-13T14:31:33  <mark_jn> they need driver fixes/support
2010-09-13T14:31:46  <jmcarthur> mark_jn: what company? they hiring? i'm on a job hunt
2010-09-13T14:31:47  <a1k0n> generate a set of 'players' which follow the Elo win/loss rules (probability of a win is the sigmoidal function applied to teh difference in underlying elo) and evaluate how well the true elo is found in N games
2010-09-13T14:31:52  <dwchandler> openbsd is awesome for routers
2010-09-13T14:31:59  <jmcarthur> kernel dev isn't really *fun* to me, but i know kernel dev at least
2010-09-13T14:32:04  <mark_jn> jmcarthur: sandvine
2010-09-13T14:32:19  <dstufft> used FreeBSD for our DNS servers too
2010-09-13T14:32:23  <mark_jn> not sure if they're hiring, i'm just a co-op student
2010-09-13T14:32:30  <dstufft> i wanted to use OpenBSD or FreeBSD for our WWW boxes
2010-09-13T14:32:34  <mark_jn> who happens to know freebsd somewhat well
2010-09-13T14:32:36  <dstufft> but they made me pick a linux
2010-09-13T14:32:58  <dwchandler> last time I was an admin we used freebsd for all the servers

2010-09-13T14:33:08  <dstufft> yea i like bsd
2010-09-13T14:33:21  <dstufft> id use it more but i spend most of my time on VPS's now adays
2010-09-13T14:33:37  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: oh, you mean an objective test. that might be a good idea
2010-09-13T14:33:52  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i also think the behavior up to convergence is important though, and i don't think we can test that objectively
2010-09-13T14:34:31  <AJC> when you play the best bots against all the default java bots in a tournament on all maps, what kind of results do they get?
2010-09-13T14:34:47  <dstufft> jmcarthur: the other option is to blow away the server and just redo it, with back ups it shouldn't take *that* long
2010-09-13T14:34:54  <jmcarthur> AJC: i think they pretty much get 100/100
2010-09-13T14:35:07  <jmcarthur> dstufft: :\
2010-09-13T14:35:09  <a1k0n> AJC: yes, mine does 100/100
2010-09-13T14:35:23  <a1k0n> though actually, the script i found that with is suspect, so i'll try again
2010-09-13T14:35:42  <AJC> a1k0n: a python script?
2010-09-13T14:35:47  <a1k0n> a shell script
2010-09-13T14:35:48  <AJC> I think I'm using the same one...
2010-09-13T14:35:52  <AJC> ah, OK.

2010-09-13T14:44:03  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4456468  ?
2010-09-13T14:44:17  <caytchen> timeout is the ultimate weapon in this game :s
2010-09-13T14:44:31  <Cyndre> I didnt timeout (not that I know of
2010-09-13T14:44:33  <Cyndre> )
2010-09-13T14:44:52  <Cyndre> in the event of a timeout does player 1 auto win?
2010-09-13T14:44:59  <a1k0n> ha, sure enough, ragebot beats my bot and the script i was using is broken
2010-09-13T14:45:07  <caytchen> ragebot is hard
2010-09-13T14:45:24  <Cyndre> I have over 90% beaten when conquered with ragebot 2.0
2010-09-13T14:45:26  <bartwe> ha, think i found my timeout
2010-09-13T14:45:33  <mega1> a1k0n: what's the % against rage?
2010-09-13T14:45:51  <bartwe> a stupid needless list copy in the templates PlanetWars.cs
2010-09-13T14:45:54  <a1k0n> mega1: will know in a couple minutes
2010-09-13T14:46:33  <Cyndre> and how come Ive gotten 1 battle today and the guy that I lost to looks like hes playing ever 30 mins
2010-09-13T14:47:05  <caytchen> bartwe: hurr? you use the template?
2010-09-13T14:47:06  <Janzert> hmm, does the java engine run games for one turn too long?
2010-09-13T14:47:14  <dstufft> Cyndre: because it's completly random
2010-09-13T14:47:24  <a1k0n> Janzert: very probably
2010-09-13T14:47:34  <bartwe> caytchen: ripped out most of it by now
2010-09-13T14:47:35  <a1k0n> i noticed that too but haven't tracked it down
2010-09-13T14:47:38  <Cyndre> dstufft: and Ive played tons of games on tcp server and local testing without 1 timeout, first time uploaded timedout
2010-09-13T14:47:48  <caytchen> bartwe: the only sane choice with that piece of code he
2010-09-13T14:48:04  <dstufft> Cyndre: theres a good chance your computer is far better then the server
2010-09-13T14:48:13  <a1k0n> mega1: 87/100 maps
2010-09-13T14:48:16  <caytchen> also, the server probably has a load of 10.0
2010-09-13T14:48:18  <Cyndre> dstufft: nothing complex about it at all
2010-09-13T14:48:18  <mega1> thanks
2010-09-13T14:48:21  <Janzert> ok, I noticed that it initialized numTurns to 0 and only stops when numTurns is > maxGameTurns
2010-09-13T14:48:35  <dstufft> it uses wall time for the turns
2010-09-13T14:48:35  <Janzert> numTurns could just get initialized to 1 to fix it
2010-09-13T14:48:49  <danielvf> Load of 2.9
2010-09-13T14:49:28  <Cyndre> if I do 1 print does the server kill my bot?
2010-09-13T14:49:30  <a1k0n> danielvf: any bots running amok?
2010-09-13T14:49:36  <danielvf> Nope
2010-09-13T14:49:38  <a1k0n> and do we know why that happens yet?
2010-09-13T14:49:46  <dstufft> a1k0n: shouldn't be, I added limits
2010-09-13T14:49:53  <a1k0n> ok cool.
2010-09-13T14:49:54  <dstufft> after 10 minutes of cpu time the kernel kills a process
2010-09-13T14:49:59  <a1k0n> dstufft: did you actually add an address space limit before?
2010-09-13T14:50:00  <dstufft> for the jail users
2010-09-13T14:50:21  <dstufft> a1k0n: yea i added an AS limit at first
2010-09-13T14:50:21  <a1k0n> or a datasize limit?
2010-09-13T14:50:26  <a1k0n> dstufft: i told you that would happen
2010-09-13T14:53:45  <dstufft> a1k0n: yea, well i limitd it to above what you suggested, 196M, I've never actually used Java so didn't know that it addressed some 700+ mb per instance
2010-09-13T14:53:59  <dstufft> atm memory limits are gone, and it is just cpu time limit
2010-09-13T14:54:00  <a1k0n> dstufft: yeah, it allocates gigs of address space and then only uses some of it
2010-09-13T14:54:11  <dstufft> 10 minutes of cpu time to be specific
2010-09-13T14:55:00  <dstufft> figure that's good enough, theortically a game should only last 3 minutes and change wall time max
2010-09-13T14:56:17  <dstufft> can probably re add the memory limit and use rss instead of as, but not going to bother unless issues stop poping up again

2010-09-13T15:09:22  <a1k0n> yes but there is
2010-09-13T15:09:28  <a1k0n> the box only has 2 gigs of RAM
2010-09-13T15:09:35  <dstufft> + paging
2010-09-13T15:09:38  <a1k0n> right
2010-09-13T15:09:49  <mega1> for all practical purpuses the amount of physical memory available to the process is what matters
2010-09-13T15:09:50  <a1k0n> so if a bot starts swapping the box and then runs it out of VM, it gets killed
2010-09-13T15:10:10  <a1k0n> therefore there's an upper limit.  somewhere.
2010-09-13T15:10:23  <Naktibalda> is it possible to get a game log from www.benzedrine.cx ?
2010-09-13T15:10:59  <dstufft> a1k0n: yea true
2010-09-13T15:11:01  <caytchen> you basically get one from the data that is sent to the canvas thingy..

2010-09-13T15:12:26  <Janzert> on the last turn of a game your bot receives variable called turns_remaining would you excpect it to have a value of one or zero?
2010-09-13T15:12:27  <Naktibalda> I get too many timeouts, should be a network issue
2010-09-13T15:12:56  <a1k0n> Janzert: 1, if the bot is able to perform any actions at all

2010-09-13T15:43:02  <ntroPi> I'll go for some coding without testing then ^^
2010-09-13T15:43:05  <Bobng> Oh, ok. Well I have just re-written compile_anything.py
2010-09-13T15:43:09  <amstan> ntroPi: we have to achieve a handshake by email
2010-09-13T15:43:16  <amstan> ntroPi: then you send me a md5 of your new password
2010-09-13T15:43:26  <ntroPi> great
2010-09-13T15:43:43  <Bobng> its a complete re-write, I got rid of the hundreds of "if" statements for each language.
2010-09-13T15:43:57  <ntroPi> if you are a admin in the forum ... my mail there is the same as for the ai account (and the nick is the same too)

2010-09-13T15:58:42  <a1k0n> and wtfbbq must have resubmitted which is why i'm in 3rd with a bunch of randombot wins.  huh.
2010-09-13T15:59:16  <mistabell> Is the timeout still 1000 ?  I see some games I lost where no one made a move
2010-09-13T15:59:33  <bartwe> well if bartwe.7 is bugfree it should also attack the top 10
2010-09-13T15:59:37  <ratatata> retybok: server said that I timed out on that :S
2010-09-13T16:00:18  <ratatata> I actually received time-out response on a game I won.. so .. I don't know :)

2010-09-13T16:02:44  <mistabell> that's what I'm wondering
2010-09-13T16:02:50  <mistabell> I don't think mine is timing out
2010-09-13T16:02:51  <Cyndre> it has to be
2010-09-13T16:03:24  <mistabell> (it beats all the default bots 100/100 without errors or timeouts)  I don't see why it would not make a first move
2010-09-13T16:03:49  <mistabell> unless maybe it's right on that 1 second limit
2010-09-13T16:04:27  <mistabell> also.. if no one moves, seems like it would be a draw, unless I'm making an illegal move.  But tricky without some sort of logging.

2010-09-13T16:05:21  <Cyndre> if 0 player won normally, if 1 other player timed out, if 2 other player illegal move

2010-09-13T16:18:02  <Janzert> btw, patch is now up to send bots the turns remaining http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=74
2010-09-13T16:18:11  <Janzert> if someone could take a look at it would be great
2010-09-13T16:19:18  <Palmik> why not just send "max turns" in the first turn?
2010-09-13T16:20:02  <Naktibalda> it's the same
2010-09-13T16:20:15  <Naktibalda> in the first turn you get max turns
2010-09-13T16:20:22  <Janzert> sending turns remaining accomplishes the same thing and keeps the property that the full global state is sent every turn so bots do not need to incrementally update if they don't want
2010-09-13T16:20:45  <Palmik> Well, whatever :)
2010-09-13T16:21:27  <Janzert> *shrug* it just seemed more in line with the rest of the protocol is all :)
2010-09-13T16:22:16  <num1> I like the property that I don't have to worry about messing up keeping track of state :)
2010-09-13T16:22:17  <Palmik> Yeah, that's true :)
2010-09-13T16:23:02  <Palmik> Hmm, I do not see how "T <int>" would be backward incompatible, at least C++ starter's package did just parse those lines starting with "P" or "F"

2010-09-13T17:37:18  <rafsoaken> rogue780: put a vanilla for loop in there and check whether it iterates, somthing is fishy
2010-09-13T17:37:35  <Zannick> what is IssueOrder?
2010-09-13T17:37:40  <Zannick> Does it take Planets or ints?
2010-09-13T17:37:58  <rafsoaken> Zannick: both
2010-09-13T17:38:10  <rafsoaken> 2 methods
2010-09-13T17:38:10  <Zannick> ah, it's overloaded?
2010-09-13T17:38:13  <Zannick> ok
2010-09-13T17:38:19  <edcba> if not you should do both anyway :)
2010-09-13T17:38:41  <edcba> Distance takes only id iirc :)
2010-09-13T17:38:55  <edcba> that's stupid :)
2010-09-13T17:39:01  <Zannick> check that findWeakest and findStrongest are actually returning values?
2010-09-13T17:39:43  <rafsoaken> Zannick: he said it is not even iterating
2010-09-13T17:40:28  <Zannick> yes, hence the "is it called" question
2010-09-13T17:41:17  <Zannick> this snippet does not show any other reason it wouldn't iterate, so i think about why it isn't issuing orders
2010-09-13T17:43:07  <rogue780> Zannick, those methods are returning a planet object
2010-09-13T17:43:13  <rogue780> i  verified it
2010-09-13T17:43:59  <Zannick> i am guessing that your problem lies outside this snippet
2010-09-13T17:44:09  <delt0r_> So what are the thoughts on relying on  the current fleet order in the input? should i do that?
2010-09-13T17:44:18  <delt0r_> I already do for planets

2010-09-13T19:51:11  <danielvf> Yeah, two big indexes
2010-09-13T19:51:12  <a1k0n> oh that explains why games from three days ago aren't showing up anymore
2010-09-13T19:51:16  <rogue780> so, can anyone access the playbacks right no?
2010-09-13T19:51:28  <danielvf> rogue780: anyone
2010-09-13T19:51:28  <ratatata> I think tcp server just sneezed screwing up a couple probably alive games ^^
2010-09-13T19:51:44  <DirtyKeyboard> rogue780: no, people without computers don't have access to your playbacks.
2010-09-13T19:51:46  <danielvf> a1k0n: I can try taking that three day thing out.
2010-09-13T19:51:50  <Naktibalda> yeah, just timeouted
2010-09-13T19:52:04  <a1k0n> danielvf: but doesn't the optimization depend on that?
2010-09-13T19:52:17  <a1k0n> or just changing g.player_two to g.loser, etc, helps?
2010-09-13T19:52:24  <rogue780> allow me to rephrase my question, is anyone else in this channel unable to playback battles right now?
2010-09-13T19:52:27  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-13T19:52:32  <danielvf> yeah, because I have two uber indexes

2010-09-13T19:52:33  <danielvf>   KEY `loser_3` (`loser`,`timestamp`,`draw`,`game_id`,`winner`)
2010-09-13T19:52:55  <DirtyKeyboard> rogue780: works fine for me, what seems to be the issue?
2010-09-13T19:52:55  <danielvf> everything this query needs is in the index
2010-09-13T19:52:57  <rogue780> am I allowed to setup a sandbox like the one at http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars without disqualifying myself from the tournament?
2010-09-13T19:53:08  <rogue780> DirtyKeyboard, pages aren't loading
2010-09-13T19:53:08  <a1k0n> ah.  but why include timestamp?
2010-09-13T19:53:12  <danielvf> which means it doesn't have to hunt all over the disk for the game details
2010-09-13T19:53:16  <Naktibalda> danielvf: oh, could you pastebin output of EXPLAIN ?
2010-09-13T19:53:17  <rogue780> DirtyKeyboard, can you access http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getplayer?player=ErrBot_0.0.3?
2010-09-13T19:53:20  <danielvf> that last where?
2010-09-13T19:53:26  <a1k0n> ...which you added?
2010-09-13T19:53:32  <DirtyKeyboard> rogue780: yep
2010-09-13T19:53:33  <Naktibalda> rogue780: I can't open my page
2010-09-13T19:53:41  <amstan> can you send more than one fleet per turn?
2010-09-13T19:53:41  <danielvf> rogue780: Yeah, in a sec
2010-09-13T19:53:57  <rogue780> amstan, yes
2010-09-13T19:54:01  <danielvf> a1k0n: Since it would get all the games before combining them, and then limiting
2010-09-13T19:54:07  <amstan> darn
2010-09-13T19:54:10  <danielvf> *games for that player
2010-09-13T19:54:31  <danielvf> Which might not be too bad
2010-09-13T19:54:34  <danielvf> But anyway
2010-09-13T19:54:36  <a1k0n> well, right
2010-09-13T19:54:41  <a1k0n> unless it's on the full listing, or whatever
2010-09-13T19:55:05  <a1k0n> so i guess it amkes sense to include timestamp in the index
2010-09-13T19:55:12  <a1k0n> as like the last part of the key
2010-09-13T19:55:32  <a1k0n> or no, just as you have it
2010-09-13T19:55:39  <a1k0n> hmm.  yeah.

2010-09-13T20:00:22  <eburnette> Is there a faster way to try my bot against others? ai-contest takes hours and benzedrine.cx takes about 5 min per game
2010-09-13T20:00:26  <Janzert> Would j3cameron be who needs to make the decision on adding turns remaining output to the bots?
2010-09-13T20:00:46  <Janzert> oops s/j3cameron/j3camero
2010-09-13T20:00:56  <bss03> eburnette: Only if someone will give you their bot to run locally.
2010-09-13T20:01:43  <ratatata> eburnette: which will not be of any help since test against 1 bot does not mean much unless that is the 'ultimate' bot :)
2010-09-13T20:01:55  <ratatata> me thinks
2010-09-13T20:01:57  <bss03> Then, you can treat it like one of the example bots.  Still match/5mins. isn't exactly slow.  200s > 180s = 3 mins.
2010-09-13T20:02:00  <Naktibalda> Janzert: wasn't it added allready?
2010-09-13T20:02:47  <Naktibalda> eburnette: you can play against example bots

2010-09-13T20:07:16  <Zannick> no problem
2010-09-13T20:07:27  <Zannick> just...google appears to sponsor in not much more than name

2010-09-13T20:08:02  <Janzert> If I volunteer to help with the issue tracker (i.e. closing bugs, marking dups) does that invalidate me from the contest?

2010-09-13T20:12:14  <a1k0n> Janzert: j3camero would be happy to have you i'm sure
2010-09-13T20:13:10  <Janzert> I'd be happy to help, if it's wanted. I'll try and ask him about that next time I see him on as well :)

2010-09-13T20:47:16  <a1k0n> the action space is so huge i don't know if anyone has attempted it

2010-09-13T20:47:44  <a1k0n> might work really well with sort of high-level actions

2010-09-13T20:47:56  <Accoun> a1k0n> u use not alpha-beta?
2010-09-13T20:48:14  <a1k0n> Accoun: my bot right now?  it just doing arithmetic on fleets incoming

2010-09-13T20:48:18  <a1k0n> it's very simple and dumb
2010-09-13T20:48:21  <num1> I'm getting over the problem a1k0n mentioned by pre-pruning out the moves that *really* don't make any sense
2010-09-13T20:49:08  <a1k0n> num1: but among the moves that do make sense, are you searching for all values of "send 20 ships to X" through "send 50 ships to X", and what about simultaneous stuff going on with other planets?
2010-09-13T20:49:29  <Accoun> a1k0n> 8n plase on tcp server, not so bad
2010-09-13T20:49:31  <sigh> a good pruning algorithm is really difficult, for me at least
2010-09-13T20:49:46  <a1k0n> Accoun: yeah, it does pretty well for how simple it is
2010-09-13T20:49:55  <a1k0n> i was very surprised to see it dominating at first
2010-09-13T20:50:38  <num1> a1k0n, i haven't completely decided yet, but If I do end up having a range of possible ships, I'll most likely only search through the endpoints of the range and the midpoint, and maybe not even the midpoint
2010-09-13T20:51:11  <a1k0n> num1: not a bad idea.  i do have a range of ships now, maybe i'll give it a shot later
2010-09-13T20:51:50  <num1> when I get it up and running (probably Sunday) we should compete on tcp :)
2010-09-13T20:51:51  <a1k0n> i think it may be better in this challenge to try to model your opponent though
2010-09-13T20:52:15  <a1k0n> though last time i discovered it was dangerous to assume your opponent was dumb
2010-09-13T20:52:26  <num1> I thought about that, but I don't know nearly enough about that sort of analysis to pull it off quickly
2010-09-13T20:52:52  <a1k0n> it comes down to probability distributions
2010-09-13T20:52:58  <num1> and every use-case I can think of *should* be automatically corrected for by the ab tree
2010-09-13T20:53:15  <mightybyte> a1k0n: You think the optimal strategy in this game is pure or mixed?
2010-09-13T20:53:19  <a1k0n> right, as long as you're searching the moves your opponent is actually going to make...
2010-09-13T20:53:28  <sigh> a-b can do everything in *theory*

2010-09-13T20:53:43  <a1k0n> but i'm leaning towards analytical vs probabilistic
2010-09-13T20:53:49  <num1> if I have time (and compute time left too!) I'll probably try to model the enemy and use the model to provide weights for my search algorithm
2010-09-13T20:54:47  <Accoun> a1k0n> jast use fast expand algoritm ignore oponent?
2010-09-13T20:55:29  <sigh> Accoun: that sort of tactic is vulnerable to rage tactics :P
2010-09-13T20:55:31  <a1k0n> Accoun: yes but you need to consider how many ships your opponent can send to each planet
2010-09-13T20:55:38  <num1> a1k0n, that's where the I'm pruning out the bad moves part comes in, I'll make it a property (if possible) that everything pruned out is guaranteed to be a worse option than something I've left in, so I'll be fighting the worse-case opponent, and if they mess up I'm just at an advantage
2010-09-13T20:56:22  <num1> Accoun, ignore opponent is probably not a good idea, due to some of the game mechanics
2010-09-13T20:57:08  <Accoun> a1k0n> its like AB on 1 move forward
2010-09-13T20:57:38  <a1k0n> Accoun: sure, if your heuristic is good.  that's basically what i'm working on now

2010-09-13T21:09:44  <Zannick> also, the currently running copybot is not quite the same as bswolf

2010-09-13T21:11:51  <Zannick> i presume it is the sheer number of fleets

2010-09-13T21:23:49  <Cyndre> the ratio between the 3 is what counts

2010-09-13T21:35:21  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-13T21:35:21  <Zannick> copybot is mostly the c++ starter bot
2010-09-13T21:35:28  <Zannick> dunno about real-1-1-1
2010-09-13T21:35:40  <sigh> damn... if parsing is the problem on c++ that's very bad

2010-09-13T21:38:19  <rogue780> bss03, don't worry. I'm sure you'll fix it and get back to kicking my ass again like you did yesterday

2010-09-13T22:04:00  <rogue780> and you didn't come back from that much of a deficit
2010-09-13T22:04:02  <bss03> rogue780: I've got to save this particular version of the bot.  It has an amazing propensity for doing that.
2010-09-13T22:04:30  <bss03> Maybe switch back to this simple strategy when I'm behind, or smth likt that.
2010-09-13T22:04:38  <rogue780> it was a fun game though http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284429037|ErrBot_0.0.3|stephen-smith.50cf

2010-09-13T22:13:16  <bss03> My bot thought it would be easy to take over. :P
2010-09-13T22:15:58  <jmcarthur> you bot is stuck up
2010-09-13T22:16:09  <bss03> How so?

2010-09-13T22:17:54  <rogue780> bss03, did I time out more than once?
2010-09-13T22:18:20  <bss03> Just once while I was watching, but I only have TCP-server on in the background.
2010-09-13T22:18:38  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: ETA on finishing?
2010-09-13T22:18:51  <rogue780> I was holding the scroll bar to read something and then I realized that it paused the process (I love windows) and I think that caused the timeout
2010-09-13T22:19:03  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: umm.... sometime tonight :)
2010-09-13T22:19:09  <rogue780> if it happened more than once though, there may be another problem
2010-09-13T22:19:11  <bss03> LOL
2010-09-13T22:19:12  <jmcarthur> i really only just got started
2010-09-13T22:19:27  <jmcarthur> and this is also making me implement some functionality that i've been neglecting, and refactor a fair bit
2010-09-13T22:19:42  <rogue780> retybok and I are playing right now
2010-09-13T22:19:49  <ermau> You know, I suspect my bot might do better if I solve all the invalid orders it seems to want to give
2010-09-13T22:19:49  <rogue780> anyone want to take bets on the winner?
2010-09-13T22:20:03  <bss03> Not really.
2010-09-13T22:20:04  <Mathnerd314> rogue780: what sort of bet?
2010-09-13T22:20:05  <rogue780> (if you want to bribe me to throw the match, I could just hold my scrollbar and time it out)
2010-09-13T22:20:10  <rogue780> Mathnerd314, bacon
2010-09-13T22:20:47  <rogue780> ermau, I found a lot of mine were 0 sized fleets
2010-09-13T22:20:54  <ermau> Mine aren't -_-
2010-09-13T22:21:02  <ermau> Which means it thinks it's getting forces out that it's not
2010-09-13T22:21:26  <rogue780> and then I wrote a helper method that transposed the destination id with the source id and caused a lot of invalid moves....
2010-09-13T22:21:28  <ermau> For some reason I keep tweaking the old bot even though I'm rewriting it
2010-09-13T22:23:42  <rogue780> bss03, if you wanna see a comeback... http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284429756|ErrBot_0.0.3|real-1-1-1
2010-09-13T22:24:42  <bss03> Grr, I hate watching real-1-1-1.
2010-09-13T22:24:47  <bss03> It boggs my browser.
2010-09-13T22:25:51  <bss03> Still, good. comeback
2010-09-13T22:26:07  <rogue780> I need to have smarter resource management I think
2010-09-13T22:26:41  <rogue780> well, retybok defeated me
2010-09-13T22:26:59  <madsy> rogue780: Why does it stop at turn 116 with no winner? Was that the round limit?

2010-09-13T22:51:14  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: i have the parsing and IO stuff in it already. i was just going to also implement some basic engine-ish functionality
2010-09-13T22:51:23  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: how about you just use my code instead. It probably does what you want. :p

2010-09-13T23:02:46  <rogue780> jmcarthur,  is haskell interpreted or compiled mainly?
2010-09-13T23:04:08  <bss03> jmcarthur: I don't like how your Owner type limits play to 2 players.

2010-09-13T23:04:46  <bss03> jmcarthur: I haven't done it, but it would be nice to have the bot easily play on a 3 or 4 player map.
2010-09-13T23:04:57  <jmcarthur> bss03: the spec very clearly states that it's for the 2-player variant of the game
2010-09-13T23:05:58  <jmcarthur> really, i don't care that some of our engines can do >2 players. the contest is only for two
2010-09-13T23:06:24  <jmcarthur> and the spec is only for two, as well
2010-09-13T23:08:00  <jmcarthur> hmm, it occurs to me that that code requires a few extensions and i'm not including them as pragmas
2010-09-13T23:08:04  <jmcarthur> i'll have to add that

2010-09-13T23:47:20  <rogue780> deepblue, i still think you might have been able make a comeback if the turn limit hadn't been hit
2010-09-13T23:48:13  <deepblue> maybe, at least I think I found the bug
2010-09-13T23:48:14  <deepblue> :)
2010-09-13T23:48:22  <num1> wait, in the game where damien beat deepblue, did he refrain from wiping deepblue out because he wanted to rack up points? I looked in the ranking system and I thought it only took into consideration win/loss
2010-09-13T23:48:37  <rogue780> if it makes you feel any better, I've lost to damien too...
