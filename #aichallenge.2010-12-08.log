2010-12-08T00:00:15  <sigh> they didn't require you to do any math for straight eco?
2010-12-08T00:00:26  <burny> I was into math since grade 2
2010-12-08T00:00:43  <burny> sucked that I couldn't learn anythign at school though, cause my faily was poor
2010-12-08T00:01:02  <burny> stupid society..
2010-12-08T00:01:05  * burny vents
2010-12-08T00:01:13  <antimatroid> sigh: nope, they had a class that did constrained optimisation etc. but it wasn't particularly hard
2010-12-08T00:01:20  <sigh> meh, I wouldn't count what most schools teach as "math" anyway :P
2010-12-08T00:01:59  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't really consider high school math to have been maths
2010-12-08T00:02:05  <antimatroid> you get that once you start doing proof based courses
2010-12-08T00:02:25  <antimatroid> the rest is more computation
2010-12-08T00:02:31  <antimatroid> by hand, the worst
2010-12-08T00:03:30  <antimatroid> i lost count of the number of intro to matrices classes i had in undergrad, it should have been one, but the university wont make all students do first year calc, it's very frustrating :\
2010-12-08T00:03:41  <antimatroid> i think it would have made it close to 10 in the end
2010-12-08T00:03:41  <burny> the thing I don't understand most of all, about scholorship stuff..
2010-12-08T00:03:55  <burny> is why would some unicversity run like, 4 different math contests..
2010-12-08T00:03:59  <sigh> antimatroid: odd, at my uni all commerce, engineering and science all had to do maths in first year
2010-12-08T00:04:03  <burny> and not offer ANY scholorship for them?
2010-12-08T00:04:08  <antimatroid> sigh: utas sucks :P
2010-12-08T00:04:22  <sigh> hehe
2010-12-08T00:04:33  <antimatroid> one can do well here, but they have to be self motivated
2010-12-08T00:04:46  <antimatroid> if one fills the bare requirements they've basically just been baby sat for 3-4 years
2010-12-08T00:04:53  *** Snowplan <Snowplan!~snowplan@pool-173-69-213-11.bltmmd.fios.verizon.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-08T00:04:59  <burny> the one year, I got 1st in teh country on 4 math contests from one university.. and didn't hear a single thing from them
2010-12-08T00:05:13  <burny> but I got accepted when I applied
2010-12-08T00:05:26  <antimatroid> what's strange about that?
2010-12-08T00:05:35  <burny> why bother running the contests?
2010-12-08T00:05:45  <antimatroid> same reason this ai contest is run
2010-12-08T00:05:46  <antimatroid> fun
2010-12-08T00:05:46  <Snowplan> ?
2010-12-08T00:05:55  <burny> ya..
2010-12-08T00:06:02  <burny> but the peopel running it, care about the results :P
2010-12-08T00:06:15  <Snowplan> don't you
2010-12-08T00:06:22  <burny> not really
2010-12-08T00:06:35  <burny> it looks nice ona resume.. but I coulda just made it up, and no one would know
2010-12-08T00:06:52  <Snowplan> same as the use of ona
2010-12-08T00:08:22  <burny> I mean.. somewhere along the lines.. someone payed like 5-10k $ for the contest to happen..
2010-12-08T00:08:38  <Snowplan> ...
2010-12-08T00:08:41  <burny> who pays 5k$ for something, with absolutely 0 care for what happens?
2010-12-08T00:09:16  <antimatroid> reputation
2010-12-08T00:09:23  <antimatroid> they pay $5k for the reputation
2010-12-08T00:09:40  <Erika> like in world of warcraft? you can give people cloth for reputation
2010-12-08T00:09:42  <antimatroid> the people running it do it for fun and to help students
2010-12-08T00:10:04  <antimatroid> but the people giving the money, they'd only do it if they think it will improve the schools image by at least "$5k"
2010-12-08T00:10:08  <Snowplan> this contest was a blast
2010-12-08T00:10:38  <Snowplan> I hope the winner got something and the rest $1
2010-12-08T00:10:47  <antimatroid> the winner got bragging rights
2010-12-08T00:10:56  <antimatroid> although it looks quite good for him to have won as well
2010-12-08T00:11:07  <Snowplan> over 5000
2010-12-08T00:11:10  <Snowplan> def
2010-12-08T00:11:37  <burny> all I got for it, was a piece of paper.. think one of them was a plaque also
2010-12-08T00:11:38  <Snowplan> it was hard enough to get into the 1---- for me
2010-12-08T00:11:42  <antimatroid> hopefully some prize money will be accumulated in the future, but i think additional money could be better spent first
2010-12-08T00:12:00  <burny> I'd have rather had a personal letter from someone who cared though, rather than a plaque
2010-12-08T00:12:25  <antimatroid> i don't care for anything like that, the only reason i'm going to my uni graduation is to please my parents
2010-12-08T00:12:36  <burny> ya, same here
2010-12-08T00:12:37  <antimatroid> i go for the education, not a piece of paper/plaque etc.
2010-12-08T00:12:37  <Snowplan> I think we should use our cumulative brains and either join or fight tech terrorism
2010-12-08T00:12:49  <Snowplan> depending on the nature
2010-12-08T00:12:55  <antimatroid> define tech terrorism?
2010-12-08T00:14:30  <sigh> the rise of the robot overlords
2010-12-08T00:15:00  <burny> only reasons I see to enter a contest of this sort..
2010-12-08T00:15:07  <burny> is reputation, money, or fun
2010-12-08T00:15:23  <antimatroid> i can't say i'm not partially motivated by reputation
2010-12-08T00:15:27  <antimatroid> but i'm mostly in it for fun
2010-12-08T00:15:35  <sigh> I did it for the money
2010-12-08T00:15:38  <antimatroid> :p
2010-12-08T00:15:38  <sigh> I'm not a smart man
2010-12-08T00:15:43  <Snowplan> lol
2010-12-08T00:15:58  <burny> well, for this one, for me.. it was for fun
2010-12-08T00:16:06  <burny> but most I enter, is either money or rep
2010-12-08T00:16:20  <antimatroid> i'm very motivated to beat accoun next time
2010-12-08T00:16:32  <sigh> haha
2010-12-08T00:16:44  <sigh> he entered this contest for the women
2010-12-08T00:16:50  <sigh> :P
2010-12-08T00:17:07  <Snowplan> its a pissing contest no doubt but it's off a 5000 ft cliff
2010-12-08T00:17:13  <antimatroid> i am yet to see one though :P
2010-12-08T00:17:22  <sigh> burnyy?
2010-12-08T00:17:39  <sigh> Snowplan: is pissing off a 500ft cliff any harder than a normal cliff?

2010-12-08T06:39:51  <dmj111> mega1: congratulations!  I haven't seen you online yet to say so.  Also, thanks for sharing the code and writeup.
2010-12-08T06:53:12  <antimatroid> dmj111: really :\ i swear he's like always on :P
2010-12-08T06:54:27  <dmj111> i'm always logged on, but rarely look at the client.
2010-12-08T06:55:07  <antimatroid> i take it you've seen the ants idea?
2010-12-08T06:56:13  <dmj111> i have seen it mentioned, but haven't really read it yet.
2010-12-08T07:00:24  <mega1> dmj111: thank you. The young guns around here are already eyeing the next contest.
2010-12-08T07:00:51  <antimatroid> mega1: i still haven't even read the first ant post properly :P
2010-12-08T07:01:11  <mega1> reading is less interesting than coding
2010-12-08T07:01:15  <antimatroid> i don't think it's really right to have people thinking about a game to be used already
2010-12-08T07:01:21  <antimatroid> but hard to avoid
2010-12-08T07:01:48  <dmj111> i saw the battlecode talk... last think I need is a new contest in a month :)
2010-12-08T07:02:02  <antimatroid> i would if i didn't have to do it in java
2010-12-08T07:06:29  <mega1> that's a deterrent for sure
2010-12-08T07:06:57  <antimatroid> that's a deal breaker for me, perhaps somewhat irrationally, but meh
2010-12-08T07:22:24  <aerique> yeah, not even languages that run on the jvm are supported because theirs is not a full jvm :(
2010-12-08T07:25:05  <antimatroid> i expected more from mit

2010-12-08T07:59:25  <antimatroid> surely there isn't a whole lot of money to be made out of ads on a flash game site?
2010-12-08T07:59:53  <antimatroid> i think the best bet for funding is companies, preferably google
2010-12-08T08:00:19  <antimatroid> i think the popularity is starting to get big enough that they might see it as a worthwhile investment
2010-12-08T08:00:41  <antimatroid> but then again, i've heard they're touch and go with codejam, which is more popular
2010-12-08T08:02:17  <antimatroid> actually, codejam had 10,192 do qualification this year
2010-12-08T08:02:35  <antimatroid> so on raw numbrs, planet wars almost got half their turn out
2010-12-08T08:07:00  <epona> what are the game basic mechanics of rock paper scissors? does anyone remember from when there was an AI contest on it?
2010-12-08T08:08:41  <antimatroid> i didn't do it, but i'm pretty sure once to bots were paired, they played a certain number of games and the person with the most wins got that win
2010-12-08T08:08:50  <antimatroid> otherwise it's a very boring competition indeed
2010-12-08T08:09:13  <antimatroid> so really, it wasn't an rps comp
2010-12-08T08:09:18  <antimatroid> it was a finitely repeated rps comp
2010-12-08T08:10:21  <epona> Im just trying to do an exam about the game mechanics of rock paper scissors, thought someone here might be able to help :/

2010-12-08T08:28:09  <antimatroid> once they've made a move twice, you could try repeating what they previously did after that move?

2010-12-08T08:30:50  <antimatroid> it's not a very interesting game imo
2010-12-08T08:31:04  <antimatroid> if you want something easier than planet wars, try tron
2010-12-08T08:32:21  <epona> tron sounds like itd be fun to work with

2010-12-08T08:40:08  <epona> oh you were in it?
2010-12-08T08:44:30  <antimatroid> hmmm yes, i got disqualified for timing out
2010-12-08T08:44:53  <antimatroid> and then didn't shut up for planet wars till that rule was changed :)
2010-12-08T08:46:02  <epona> disqualified?
2010-12-08T08:46:13  <epona> like out of the contest perma?
2010-12-08T08:47:08  <antimatroid> yes, it was a very stupid rule that i didn't even know existed till it happened
2010-12-08T08:47:18  <antimatroid> hence why i didn't shut up til it was changed
2010-12-08T08:47:52  <epona> thats gotta be like the worst loss ever. lose AND get permabanned
2010-12-08T08:48:20  <antimatroid> i was expecting to finish top 10 :C
2010-12-08T08:48:24  <antimatroid> http://www.mastercard.com/ aha
2010-12-08T08:50:16  <epona> not loading
2010-12-08T08:51:19  <antimatroid> that's the point :P
2010-12-08T08:51:22  <antimatroid> ddosd
2010-12-08T08:51:57  <antimatroid> 4chan is pissed cause mastercard cut wikileaks off
2010-12-08T08:52:03  <antimatroid> i'm just sitting back and enjoying the show
2010-12-08T08:52:44  <epona> NICE
2010-12-08T08:52:45  <epona> lol
2010-12-08T09:01:01  <antimatroid> seriously, agreements should request that users confirm they haven't read them before continuing and readme.txt should be dontreadme.txt
2010-12-08T09:01:09  <antimatroid> i bet more people would actually read them
2010-12-08T09:05:39  <epona> mastercard down 9 points in market today, thats 4.87 million USD according to marketwatch.com
2010-12-08T09:05:57  <epona> fucking owned
2010-12-08T09:07:23  <antimatroid> what would be owned is if they managed to take out the servers doing the transactions
2010-12-08T09:07:33  <antimatroid> that'd be a real kick in the balls
2010-12-08T09:07:38  <antimatroid> or drop punt to the ovaries
2010-12-08T09:07:44  <antimatroid> whichever gender you want to do with
2010-12-08T09:07:51  <antimatroid> go*
2010-12-08T09:08:00  <epona> lol, they end up losing actual liquid money
2010-12-08T09:10:33  <antimatroid> awesome, i just went to a website and they played a mastercard add for 30 seconds
2010-12-08T09:10:40  <antimatroid> meaning i just cost them like a cent

2010-12-08T21:19:35  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: you should find the video of the spokesperson announcing it. he interjected a couple remarks about the irony as he read the press release. i felt bad for him, having to be in front of the camera and reading that
2010-12-08T21:19:50  <jmcarthur> but it was kind of funny that even he thought it was stupid
2010-12-08T21:20:14  <antimatroid> i'm in the reddit thread now :)
2010-12-08T21:20:18  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-12-08T21:20:52  <antimatroid> this whole thing is awesome
2010-12-08T21:21:13  <antimatroid> people are running around like chickens with their heads cut off
2010-12-08T21:22:42  <jmcarthur> my prospects of certain government jobs are probably over. i've tweeted about wikileaks a bit too much, i bet
2010-12-08T21:23:17  <antimatroid> i keep fairly quiet on that regard, but i could never work for the government
2010-12-08T21:23:27  <jmcarthur> and of course that's just sad that my job prospects could be affected by something like that
2010-12-08T21:23:31  <antimatroid> i actively do stupid things just so i'm not doing what people tell me to do
2010-12-08T21:23:44  <antimatroid> it's somehow more fulfilling for me :D
2010-12-08T21:23:47  <jmcarthur> i never had a government job, but i did work for a government contractor once
2010-12-08T21:24:17  <jmcarthur> it was actually a nice job. challenging, relaxed... and i was surrounded, oddly, by quite antiauthoritarian people :)
2010-12-08T21:24:45  <antimatroid> it is rather sad that it could affect job prospects
2010-12-08T21:24:46  <jmcarthur> but my understanding is that most gov. and gov. contractor jobs are not like that
2010-12-08T21:27:10  <antimatroid> oh god, this video is pure gold
2010-12-08T21:27:50  <jmcarthur> i know! it's awesome
2010-12-08T21:28:28  <antimatroid> do as we say, not what we do :@
