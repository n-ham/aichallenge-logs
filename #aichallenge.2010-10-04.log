2010-10-04T00:14:04  <bhasker> hey
2010-10-04T00:14:08  <bhasker> how is your bot coming along
2010-10-04T00:15:28  <bhasker> my bot gets worse with every iteration i make
2010-10-04T00:15:33  <bhasker> at least i got my logging cleaned up
2010-10-04T00:15:44  <amstan> bhasker: you mean everyone gets better?
2010-10-04T00:15:58  <bhasker> no my bot gets worse, it loses to itself
2010-10-04T00:16:05  <bhasker> rather newer versions lose to my older ones
2010-10-04T00:16:06  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-04T00:16:13  <bhasker> everyone else is also getting better
2010-10-04T00:16:19  <amstan> bhasker: idk.. that's not really a good measure
2010-10-04T00:16:28  <bhasker> thats a problem to face if i can consistently beat my own older version
2010-10-04T00:19:00  <bhasker> ah perfect balance http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=297068
2010-10-04T00:19:09  <sigh> I am also finding many new and innovating ways to make my bot worse
2010-10-04T00:24:03  <a1k0n> i haven't made a working one in a while, though i'm working on a couple ideas
2010-10-04T00:24:47  <a1k0n> and also playing minecraft
2010-10-04T00:25:30  <sigh> everyone is on minecraft o_O
2010-10-04T00:25:40  <a1k0n> but mostly playing with my kid, who won't stop shouting "dada build a tunnel" "dada build something" "dada build a track"
2010-10-04T00:25:49  <sigh> :)
2010-10-04T00:26:23  <a1k0n> we had to get a few more wooden train set parts today so as to maximize the potential of the track we have
2010-10-04T00:27:00  <amstan> a1k0n: i can has your map?
2010-10-04T00:27:08  <a1k0n> minecraft map?
2010-10-04T00:28:02  <amstan> a1k0n: yeah
2010-10-04T00:28:11  <a1k0n> where does that even get stored on the mac version?
2010-10-04T00:28:20  <a1k0n> i wish multiplayer worked better
2010-10-04T00:28:24  <amstan> idk, app data?
2010-10-04T00:28:32  <amstan> wait, that's windows
2010-10-04T00:28:33  <amstan> no idea
2010-10-04T00:28:35  <a1k0n> ahha.  application support.
2010-10-04T00:28:35  <amstan> lol
2010-10-04T00:28:42  <amstan> it's .minecraft in linux

2010-10-04T00:30:51  <amstan> s/here/there
2010-10-04T00:31:07  <a1k0n> i left off inside a deep cave.. follow the torches on the left to get out (there's a complex bit with some lava which might be hard to figure out)
2010-10-04T00:31:15  <a1k0n> or just... kill yourself
2010-10-04T00:31:28  <a1k0n> i have a giant tower on a hill with a zen garden on top, with some trees
2010-10-04T00:31:31  <a1k0n> and some grass
2010-10-04T00:31:34  <amstan> neat..

2010-10-04T00:36:51  <amstan> though.. there's a cave system south of you
2010-10-04T00:36:58  <a1k0n> yeah.  i wish i knew where i was on that map

2010-10-04T00:40:19  <a1k0n> i just had a skeleton walk by after clearing out the coal

2010-10-04T01:14:39  <sigh> no stalemate this time :)
2010-10-04T01:15:35  <bhasker> heh, more importantly i got the coordinated attack stuff working a bit
2010-10-04T01:15:49  <bhasker> though i am not sure coordinating attack against enemy planets helps much
2010-10-04T01:15:53  <sigh> cool :)
2010-10-04T01:16:05  <sigh> it should
2010-10-04T01:16:07  <bhasker> when i try that,ships just pile up while enemy is expanding
2010-10-04T01:16:24  <sigh> ah, well you need to make sure that you expand yourself too
2010-10-04T01:16:56  <sigh> if you only attack, then you are just a ragebot variant :P
2010-10-04T01:17:02  <bhasker> :p
2010-10-04T01:17:12  <bhasker> let me try putting the coordinate code back in and see
2010-10-04T01:18:32  <sigh> oh, I thought that game was with coordinated attacks
2010-10-04T01:19:48  <sigh> I call it a coordinated attack if multiple sources attack work together to attack a single target
2010-10-04T01:19:59  <bhasker> yea mine does it for neutrals
2010-10-04T01:20:24  <bhasker> for enemy controlled planets i haven't yet got that working since
2010-10-04T01:20:33  <bhasker> i do some prediction on staging planets
2010-10-04T01:20:43  <bhasker> so i tend to send ships ahead of time too
2010-10-04T01:21:37  <sigh> the general method of attacking in that game doesn't seem to bad
2010-10-04T01:21:47  <sigh> *too

2010-10-04T01:27:06  <bhasker> hmm i am not sure why my bot decided to attack him
2010-10-04T01:27:09  <bhasker> going through logs

2010-10-04T01:30:52  <antimatroid2> plus i have to goto sydney this weekend for a family wedding :|
2010-10-04T01:31:28  <bhasker> gah it was a stupid heuristic that screwed me over, it decided taking the neutrals was too expensive, so since it had ships left over
2010-10-04T01:31:32  <bhasker> enemy was the only planets left
2010-10-04T01:31:36  <bhasker> so it sent all of them at the enemy
2010-10-04T01:31:54  <sigh> bhasker: ah, fixing that up should make it much better
2010-10-04T01:32:12  <bhasker> also not sure why it thought it could acuqire the planet with 50 ships when the planet was halfway across the map
2010-10-04T01:32:31  <sigh> :)
2010-10-04T01:33:27  <bhasker> oh its a 1 growth planet
2010-10-04T01:33:37  <bhasker> at a distance of 18
2010-10-04T01:33:45  <bhasker> with 6 ships on it

2010-10-04T02:14:43  <sigh> huh? does alpha-beta stop working in that case?
2010-10-04T02:15:19  <antimatroid2> well no, but i think it's more likely that you can go down what seems like a bad path with this for a few moves and then it pays off
2010-10-04T02:15:38  <antimatroid2> given one isn't going to penetrate very far as well, i'm unsure as to whether it might miss that somehow
2010-10-04T02:15:53  <sigh> but the reason alpha-beta prunes is that because a path is provably worse, no?
2010-10-04T02:16:22  <sigh> out of the set of moves you are considering
2010-10-04T02:16:27  <Janzert> yeah, alpha-beta should still be better
2010-10-04T02:16:52  <sigh> I can't see how alpha-beta would change the result in any way
2010-10-04T02:16:54  <Janzert> than pure min-max that is
2010-10-04T02:17:10  <sigh> I thought it only changes the number of nodes that you lok at
2010-10-04T02:17:17  <sigh> *look
2010-10-04T02:17:35  <Janzert> sigh: right, as long as you don't get into transposition table issues (which probably don't apply here at all)
2010-10-04T02:17:59  <sigh> yeah, that's a separate issue :)
2010-10-04T02:18:06  <antimatroid2> sigh: cause the payoff for a state might look bad, but then you get to make a move 2 or 3 turns later that makes it good?
2010-10-04T02:18:27  <sigh> but that's an inherent problem with your minimax
2010-10-04T02:18:28  <antimatroid2> even the payoff function has to be fairly guessy for this
2010-10-04T02:18:36  <antimatroid2> for tron it was fairly easy to set up a decent payoff function
2010-10-04T02:19:39  <sigh> that's a problem with minimax, alpha-beta doesn't make it better or worse
2010-10-04T02:20:12  <Janzert> barring bugs, minimax and alpha-beta with a deterministic evaluation function should always return the same result
2010-10-04T02:20:29  <antimatroid2> if i generate the tree with pruning, then extend those non-dominated nodes, isn't it possible for me to miss a node that became good again?
2010-10-04T02:20:34  <Janzert> when searching to the same depth that is
2010-10-04T02:20:51  <sigh> antimatroid2: the point of alpha-beta is to prune ONLY when you know that it won't affect the result
2010-10-04T02:21:15  <antimatroid2> but with the tree extending, that result might change?
2010-10-04T02:21:32  <sigh> that's a problem with minimax, not alpha-beta
2010-10-04T02:21:52  <antimatroid2> yes, but if i then extend normal minimax, i see that, if i skip it with alpha-beta, i don't see it?
2010-10-04T02:21:58  <antimatroid2> hence it's not a problem with minimax?
2010-10-04T02:22:31  <sigh> what do you mean by extending?
2010-10-04T02:22:33  * Janzert is unsure what you mean by extending the tree
2010-10-04T02:22:39  <sigh> :)
2010-10-04T02:22:53  <antimatroid2> you generate to a certain depth, then realsie you have more time, so you keep extending
2010-10-04T02:22:55  <sigh> are you doing iterative deeping?
2010-10-04T02:23:04  <sigh> oh you are *storing* the entire tree? o_O
2010-10-04T02:23:18  <antimatroid2> no, iterative deepening
2010-10-04T02:23:26  <antimatroid2> if i have time left, i will extend
2010-10-04T02:23:39  <sigh> then you don't care what alpha-beta pruned last iteration
2010-10-04T02:23:43  <sigh> this is a new iteration
2010-10-04T02:24:52  <antimatroid2> when one normally iteratively deepens, do they throw new payoffs back up the tree as they find them? or do a final scan at the end?
2010-10-04T02:25:07  <antimatroid2> i would normally have tended to go with the former

2010-10-04T02:25:29  <sigh> in my knowledge yes, usually you keep track of the moves to inform search order but that's about it
2010-10-04T02:25:48  <sigh> the values from last time are only useful as a heuristic
2010-10-04T02:26:02  <Janzert> normally a true tree structure isn't built at all
2010-10-04T02:26:21  <sigh> yup ^^
2010-10-04T02:26:27  <antimatroid2> last time we could have a tree that just threw out large chunks each turn, but we have to generate from scratch every turn this time
2010-10-04T02:26:36  <sigh> yes
2010-10-04T02:26:38  <antimatroid2> so just do them in vectors?
2010-10-04T02:26:46  <antimatroid2> and not actually generate a tree? i do that for graphs
2010-10-04T02:27:01  <antimatroid2> vector<vector<int> > myGraph :)
2010-10-04T02:27:11  <sigh> the point of iterative deepening is that each iteration is exponentially larger, so that the cost of the previous iterations are not significant
2010-10-04T02:27:13  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.81.234> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-10-04T02:27:26  <Janzert> basically you just do a depth-first search of the tree, you don't store it at all really
2010-10-04T02:27:33  <sigh> yeah, don't generate the game tree as an actual data structure :)
2010-10-04T02:28:15  <sigh> but as I said, you can remember the results at the top to inform search order
2010-10-04T02:28:20  <Janzert> the transposition table is an optimization to remember the results of searching a chunk of the tree, but is a simple flat hashmap
2010-10-04T02:28:22  <sigh> that should help priuning
2010-10-04T02:28:56  <sigh> Janzert: that only helps within one iteration?
2010-10-04T02:29:22  <antimatroid2> okay, that would make sense :P
2010-10-04T02:29:25  <sigh> I can't see how it would carry across iterations, but I have not implemented alpha-beta with transposition tables
2010-10-04T02:29:34  <antimatroid2> i wont be using anywhere near as much memory this time aha
2010-10-04T02:29:39  <sigh> haha
2010-10-04T02:29:40  <Janzert> no it's a huge boost for the iterative deepening by remembering the best move for most positions the next iteration runs into
2010-10-04T02:29:52  <Janzert> at least in games like chess
2010-10-04T02:30:08  <sigh> ah, so just as a heuristic for search order?
2010-10-04T02:30:18  <antimatroid2> how do you do deepening without storing? i get that you store the states at those end points, do you just store inside that the path of play to get there?
2010-10-04T02:30:39  <Janzert> sigh: basically yes
2010-10-04T02:31:03  <Janzert> antimatroid: you start the search over but with a depth + 1 of the last search
2010-10-04T02:31:25  <antimatroid2> wouldn't that be very costly time wise?

2010-10-04T02:31:56  <sigh> only constant factor :P
2010-10-04T02:32:01  <antimatroid2> you still get that many more states searched
2010-10-04T02:32:28  <antimatroid2> why not just have a vector of states to extend with information about the path that got there?
2010-10-04T02:32:38  <antimatroid2> memory isn't that constrained
2010-10-04T02:33:27  <Janzert> it really is for most game branching factors and the time limits generally used

2010-10-04T02:34:59  <sigh> sure, you can cache that sort of stuff
2010-10-04T02:35:10  <antimatroid2> i'm not expecting the game tree to generate very far, considering you want to consider a large number of moves on each of your frist turns
2010-10-04T02:36:28  <sigh> if move generation is very expensive, then sure cache that
2010-10-04T02:37:13  <antimatroid2> i'm even considering having each of my "terminal" nodes playing their own game for a specified number of turns to see how that pans out
2010-10-04T02:37:34  <sigh> that's an expensive evaluation function
2010-10-04T02:37:44  <antimatroid2> it's also quite a nice one
2010-10-04T02:37:54  <sigh> depends
2010-10-04T02:37:56  <antimatroid2> you could even try to predict some qualities about their bot and have it run against that
2010-10-04T02:38:22  <sigh> if it was that nice, you would not need minimax :P
2010-10-04T02:38:46  <antimatroid2> yes, but how are you planning to do payoff otherwise?
2010-10-04T02:38:52  <sigh> but yeah, I get your point
2010-10-04T02:39:02  <antimatroid2> yourShips - theirShips + remainingTime(yourGrowth - theirGrowth) is quite a nice idea
2010-10-04T02:39:11  <antimatroid2> but it doesn't take into account position strength and many other things
2010-10-04T02:39:40  <antimatroid2> you'd also want that after all current fleets have run their course

2010-10-04T03:51:12  <rabidus> i can't understand why is forbidden to use multiple bots
2010-10-04T03:51:30  <rabidus> like one would be aggressive, one would be defensive, one would be mix ...
2010-10-04T03:51:44  <HakanD> dunno
2010-10-04T03:51:47  <rabidus> how can you cheat with those
2010-10-04T03:52:14  <rabidus> say, 5 bots at max
2010-10-04T03:52:26  <rabidus> it would be problem if someone uploads 100000 bots :)

2010-10-04T04:02:23  <Frontier> rabidus: I believe they didn't expect even 2500 people to join. They had to put something together to make the server go faster. So it really would be a problem for the organizers if we all had two or three bots :)
2010-10-04T04:03:25  <Frontier> Or would you split your time share on your three bots, so each of them plays only every third match?

2010-10-04T04:06:12  <znutar> how many people joined so far?
2010-10-04T04:06:24  <Frontier> Hey 1631 lines of code. That's less than I expected. After all I have learned a lot now about C++ streams, logging and loading of plugins.
2010-10-04T04:07:42  <antimatroid2> i'm probably at around 2500 :| yikes
2010-10-04T04:08:07  <Frontier> znutar: You can click on the last page of the ranking to see the number. That are all people who uploaded something working. ~300 of them have crashing/inactive bots though.
2010-10-04T04:08:33  <antimatroid2> another 2000 or so have extremely shit bots
2010-10-04T04:09:15  <Frontier> Yeah some get bitten by RageBot.
2010-10-04T04:09:34  <antimatroid2> lol, dmj still gets beaten by ragebot sometimes on tcp
2010-10-04T04:11:53  <Frontier> Somehow I lost interest in writing a bot. It became much more fun to learn new stuff while coding. For example I can now compile bots into the code or load them at runtime from a .so file. That was fun to see in the logs: "Bot not compiled in, checking for ./bots/RageBot.so... bot loaded!" :D
2010-10-04T04:16:16  *** Florian <Florian!~Florian@darkstar2.fullsix.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-04T04:17:34  <Frontier> I had to learn that in order to get a plug-in to find functions in the main program the main-program must be compiled for dynamic linking. Maybe next year I make the games plug-ins as well.
2010-10-04T04:17:36  <rabidus> Frontier: sry big response delay. but, if some site gets more popular what they expect, then it is good thing, i think. maybe few google ads in front page
2010-10-04T04:17:46  *** Florian95 <Florian95!~Florian@darkstar2.fullsix.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-04T04:17:50  <rabidus> and that way few servers more
2010-10-04T04:18:02  <rabidus> or google would support some mor
2010-10-04T04:18:04  <rabidus> more
2010-10-04T04:18:15  <rabidus> maybe few cluster...... ;)
2010-10-04T04:18:43  <Frontier> Sure, but more servers means that the challenge is split up until they can add a feature that works on a cluster
2010-10-04T04:19:27  <Frontier> Ok.. they could split WEB, DB, "whatever server the action runs on"
2010-10-04T04:19:37  <rabidus> ah, it doesn't work like that now?
2010-10-04T04:19:41  <Frontier> But maybe that is already split.
2010-10-04T04:20:05  <Frontier> Ask amstan, the admin.
2010-10-04T04:20:14  <rabidus> i think most cpu time is taken by challenge-motor
2010-10-04T04:20:19  <rabidus> not web/mysql
2010-10-04T04:20:30  <rabidus> i mean like compiling and the fight-part
2010-10-04T04:21:14  <Frontier> I don't know how much this 'elo' calculation takes and how well it scales with entries and played matches. It's probably a notable part of the CPU load now.
2010-10-04T04:21:37  <rabidus> sounds sick
2010-10-04T04:21:39  <rabidus> .)
2010-10-04T04:22:02  <rabidus> its just an algorithm
2010-10-04T04:22:06  <Frontier> Compiling the C++ entries can also take its time
2010-10-04T04:22:13  <rabidus> like i said
2010-10-04T04:22:24  <Frontier> oh i see ^^
2010-10-04T04:22:26  <rabidus> :)
2010-10-04T04:23:35  <Frontier> I wonder if some languages are really slow there when they are reloaded over and over. That said I'm confident with C++ ^^
2010-10-04T04:24:53  <rabidus> wonder how big percent of participants are using c#, c++, java or other language which needs precompiling
2010-10-04T04:24:59  <rabidus> 60% ?
2010-10-04T04:25:02  <rabidus> 70% ?
2010-10-04T04:25:10  <Frontier> hmm... *looks at ranking*
2010-10-04T04:25:15  <sigh> doubt its that high
2010-10-04T04:25:21  <rabidus> that says its something 80%
2010-10-04T04:25:35  <antimatroid2> rankings mean nothing at this point
2010-10-04T04:25:42  <antimatroid2> the top 10 is still mostly heuristic bots
2010-10-04T04:25:43  <sigh> 618 using python alone
2010-10-04T04:25:57  <sigh> that's over 20%
2010-10-04T04:26:03  <rabidus> :o
2010-10-04T04:26:12  <rabidus> 747 c++
2010-10-04T04:26:20  <antimatroid2> c++ <3
2010-10-04T04:26:20  <Frontier> hwo do u know? did you count them?
2010-10-04T04:26:30  <sigh> http://www.ai-contest.com/language_profile.php?lang=Python&page=7
2010-10-04T04:26:34  <rabidus> :)
2010-10-04T04:26:38  <rabidus> 942 java
2010-10-04T04:26:52  <antimatroid2> Frontier: you can click on languages, countries, organisations etc. to see a leaderboard of that specific item
2010-10-04T04:27:12  <antimatroid2> they had links to such things last time with rankings across countries etc.
2010-10-04T04:27:13  <rabidus> 293 c#, so its something like 2000 are using c#,c++ or java
2010-10-04T04:27:18  <antimatroid2> i'm unsure as to why they no longer have that
2010-10-04T04:27:41  <rabidus> 2000 out of 2742
2010-10-04T04:27:52  <rabidus> 70% is pretty close
2010-10-04T04:28:04  <sigh> hmm... yeah
2010-10-04T04:28:32  <antimatroid2> anyone that uses java is a terrible person by nature :)
2010-10-04T04:28:32  <rabidus> quite cpu intensive
2010-10-04T04:28:49  <rabidus> tell that to rsergio
2010-10-04T04:28:57  <rabidus> or felixcoto

2010-10-04T04:29:28  <Frontier> I like Java. Compile it once, run it everywhere! And I like the syntax.
2010-10-04T04:29:44  <antimatroid2> ha, i'm surprised my bot went back in
2010-10-04T04:29:45  <rabidus> object.object.object.object(variable)
2010-10-04T04:29:48  <sigh> ok, I hadn't refreshed my page
2010-10-04T04:29:50  <Frontier> And the standard library that comes with it.
2010-10-04T04:30:26  <Frontier> rabidus: Have you ever worked with function pointers macros and templates in C++ ^^ ?
2010-10-04T04:30:36  <rabidus> thank god no :D
2010-10-04T04:30:39  <rabidus> well
2010-10-04T04:30:40  <Frontier> Java is so .... clean and easy
2010-10-04T04:30:48  <rabidus> yes i have, but non like in java scale
2010-10-04T04:30:55  <Frontier> even my sister can use it ;)
2010-10-04T04:31:01  <rabidus> Frontier: whats c# then?
2010-10-04T04:31:04  <antimatroid2> java isn't easy
2010-10-04T04:31:11  <antimatroid2> i don't understand people thinking that
2010-10-04T04:31:20  <Frontier> c# is M$, nuf said
2010-10-04T04:31:21  <sigh> python is clean and easy :P
2010-10-04T04:31:27  <antimatroid2> like you can't even take a string varialbe and just access elemetns like s[10]
2010-10-04T04:31:35  <antimatroid2> it's something like s.charAt(10); wtf is that
2010-10-04T04:31:43  <sigh> haha, yeah
2010-10-04T04:32:03  <Frontier> its for the greater good! look how easy it is to parse java code
2010-10-04T04:32:13  <rabidus> lol
2010-10-04T04:32:15  <rabidus> thats not true
2010-10-04T04:32:19  <Frontier> not even overloaded operators anywhere
2010-10-04T04:32:20  <rabidus> python is better on parsing
2010-10-04T04:32:24  <sigh> compared to c++ maybe
2010-10-04T04:32:24  <antimatroid2> my only dislikes for c++ so far are not supporting general multidimensional vectors or overloading operator precedence
2010-10-04T04:32:30  <sigh> but not compared to most
2010-10-04T04:33:33  <rabidus> vector<vector<int>> davector;
2010-10-04T04:33:41  <sigh> ^^ fails
2010-10-04T04:33:45  <rabidus> why
2010-10-04T04:33:54  <sigh> vector< vector<int> > davector;
2010-10-04T04:33:57  <Frontier> I use quite some python and Java GUI programs. They do their job :) I think both languages work well with larger projects.
2010-10-04T04:33:58  <sigh> c++ doesn't like >>
2010-10-04T04:34:04  <rabidus> aah
2010-10-04T04:34:04  <rabidus> :D
2010-10-04T04:34:06  <rabidus> sry
2010-10-04T04:34:13  <rabidus> ok, it was pseudo :)
2010-10-04T04:34:15  <sigh> haha, nah... just being pedantic
2010-10-04T04:34:19  <sigh> :P
2010-10-04T04:34:31  <Frontier> sigh: another stupidity that would never have made it into java.
2010-10-04T04:34:47  <sigh> Frontier: as I said, java is easier to parse comapred to c++
2010-10-04T04:34:53  <sigh> but not most other languages
2010-10-04T04:35:09  <antimatroid2> how is that stupid?
2010-10-04T04:35:21  <sigh> and really, if your claim to fame is to have cleaner syntax than c++... then I'm sorry for your lots
2010-10-04T04:35:53  <Frontier> Also I have my difficulties with copy constructors now and then. When I have a vector<SomeHugeComplexStuff> and I add something with .push_back(...) it ends up being copied.
2010-10-04T04:37:36  <Frontier> sigh: Did you find the boost foreach macro yet? It is pretty nice to have and cleans up the code quite a bit when iterating over list<>s
2010-10-04T04:38:07  <sigh> yeah, but does the server support boost yet?
2010-10-04T04:38:11  <sigh> I haven't checked
2010-10-04T04:38:24  <Frontier> I will check on my next upload ^^

2010-10-04T04:39:21  <sigh> I remember a while back I uploaded some code with boost smart pointers and that failed
2010-10-04T04:39:35  <sigh> I also remeber someone asking for boost in the forums, so maybe they put it in

2010-10-04T04:44:05  <Frontier> I have a source linux distribution, thats why it was always installed on my box but not on Ubuntu.
2010-10-04T04:46:01  <Frontier> hmm.. only exotic or gui applications depend on it on my installation. Seems I was more lucky than I though. Ok then I just copy the .hpp file from /usr/include/boost into the uploaded zip file ;)
2010-10-04T04:48:04  <sigh> "the .hpp"? what file are you including that does not depend on 10 other files?

2010-10-04T07:07:37  <antimatroid2> rather than split it all up

2010-10-04T07:08:39  <sigh> you shouldn't need to skip all over the place, the sub-functions should have obvious names with obvious roles
2010-10-04T07:09:04  <antimatroid2> yeah, but then when you go back through and look, to see that code you need to skip somewhere else, then go back, or somewhere else

2010-10-04T09:04:22  <rabidus> btw. its very difficult to make a score of a planet, like 'how important that planet is'

2010-10-04T09:09:22  <rabidus> i make it kinda just opposite
2010-10-04T09:09:31  <rabidus> i check that how many ships i can waste for neutral
2010-10-04T09:09:39  <rabidus> i dont care about enemy :)
2010-10-04T09:09:50  <rabidus> it still is only a enemy
2010-10-04T09:10:02  <rabidus> but, i'm noob
2010-10-04T09:10:16  <sigh> well, what I mean is that I can compare neutrals to each other, enemy to each other... but hard to determine when to attack and enemy instead of a neutral
2010-10-04T09:10:29  <rabidus> yep, thats true
2010-10-04T09:14:07  <sigh> I've come up with a kind of kludge which allows me to compare them on the same scale... but I don't like it very much
2010-10-04T09:14:42  <rabidus> it must be made based on production expectations ... or something
2010-10-04T09:14:52  <rabidus> ie. expected value
2010-10-04T09:15:23  <sigh> similar concept, yes

2010-10-04T09:19:51  <BtbN> it's also a good idea to "steal" neutral planets if the enemy attacks it wih just a little more than needed just send a small number of ships that arive 1 turn after your enemy, and the planet is yours
2010-10-04T09:20:11  <rabidus> thats what i call neutral sniping :)
2010-10-04T09:20:18  <BtbN> And it's a good idea, to check neutral planets you plan to attack against this in your AI
2010-10-04T09:24:29  <Migi32> yeah, and to prevent that, if you attack a neutral, send a small fleet to it the turn after as well

2010-10-04T09:25:45  <Migi32> you can destroy a ton of bots this way, cause they think "oh, if I send a small fleet now I can snipe this neutral"

2010-10-04T13:24:07  <Janzert> thanks, that had been what I thought it would be as well but wasn't sure
2010-10-04T13:24:19  <amstan> the only thing we don't allow is network communications and file writing
2010-10-04T13:24:31  * Janzert nods
2010-10-04T13:24:32  <jmcarthur> and os threads
2010-10-04T13:24:36  <Migi32> amstan, why no file writing?
2010-10-04T13:24:46  <amstan> Migi32: because it's hard to keep track of it
2010-10-04T13:24:48  <amstan> actually
2010-10-04T13:24:54  <amstan> i think you're allowed file writing
2010-10-04T13:24:57  <endunio> dwchandler: tcp_server compiles with canvas, getmaps, getplayer and getratings, how to configure apache to work with it?
2010-10-04T13:25:03  <amstan> but don't expect it to be there after the match
2010-10-04T13:25:15  <jmcarthur> there is a tight limit on file handles though
2010-10-04T13:25:18  <Migi32> ah ok :)
2010-10-04T13:25:30  <Migi32> well there'd be no way to access it anyway
2010-10-04T13:25:31  <amstan> jmcarthur: but that's not really an intentional rule, it's just because of the sandbox
2010-10-04T13:25:34  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-10-04T13:26:36  <dwchandler> endunio: see apachedocs about enabling CGI, ExecCGI directive, etc.

2010-10-04T13:34:10  <McLeopold> Migi32: not completely.  I've written my own framework.  It's built on that.
2010-10-04T13:35:21  <McLeopold> The idea was a rewrite.
2010-10-04T13:35:59  <McLeopold> I just tried to build a bot that would look cool when playing, yet be good enough to survive long enough that people would see it being cool.
2010-10-04T13:36:34  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-10-04T13:36:47  <Migi32> it makes for interesting games
2010-10-04T13:36:47  <Migi32> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=305806
2010-10-04T13:37:38  <Migi32> but in many of your games there are small planets building up stuff that you don't really use
2010-10-04T13:38:00  <McLeopold> The idea is this: each planet picks some good targets, then waits for enough ships to punch through and keeps sending re-enforcements.
2010-10-04T13:38:19  <McLeopold> Thus the "worm" part.
2010-10-04T13:38:38  <McLeopold> It only sends toward the enemy, not away from.
2010-10-04T13:38:58  <McLeopold> It will pause if there is some incoming fleets.
2010-10-04T13:39:07  <McLeopold> That's about it.
2010-10-04T13:39:18  <McLeopold> Build that and you have a fairly good bot.
2010-10-04T13:39:54  <McLeopold> Of course "good targets" is where all the magic is. :)

2010-10-04T13:40:45  <jmcarthur> that's the secret sauce in any bot
2010-10-04T13:41:25  <jmcarthur> well, fleet size, too, i guess
2010-10-04T13:41:34  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: yes, but it's also interesting how few bots have good defense
2010-10-04T13:41:59  <jmcarthur> yeah most people are thinking about what tactics to use without considering how others will use those tactics against them
2010-10-04T13:42:30  <McLeopold> I figure saving a planet is the same as taking one.
2010-10-04T13:42:33  <jmcarthur> defense is less "fun" to think about, perhaps
2010-10-04T13:42:59  <jmcarthur> my bot isn't even really going to see defense and offense as different things
2010-10-04T13:43:11  <McLeopold> Yeah, exactly.
2010-10-04T13:43:14  <dwchandler> jmcarthur: bingo
2010-10-04T13:43:24  <McLeopold> A planet is a planet, who care who owns it.
2010-10-04T13:43:36  <jmcarthur> well, i do care who owns it
2010-10-04T13:43:47  <jmcarthur> it's just that i care who owns it in the future more than i care about right now
2010-10-04T13:44:05  <dwchandler> more like "this planet is important. just because I own it doesn't mean I stop dealing with it."
2010-10-04T13:44:28  <McLeopold> dwchandler: yeah, that is what I was trying to say
2010-10-04T13:44:54  <McLeopold> are you paying attention Migi32?

2010-10-04T13:45:16  <Migi32> but I am now :P
2010-10-04T13:45:57  <jmcarthur> in fact it is usually easier to hold a planet than to get a new one, so if you factor ease of taking a planet into your value function (along with payoff, what your opponent is going to do, etc.) then it should be easy to see when to defend and when to attack

2010-10-04T14:01:38  <Migi32> how do you think this rule would work: never try to capture a neutral if it's closer to the enemy than to you?

2010-10-04T14:05:38  <Migi32> dwchandler, well that rule would translate to altering the scoring function with something like if (closer to enemy than to me) { score -= 10000; }

2010-10-04T14:14:04  <bhasker_> if you have more production/ships than enemy it doesn't really matter much since you can usually reinforce the neutral
2010-10-04T14:14:07  <bhasker_> but if tis a close tie
2010-10-04T14:14:12  <bhasker_> you probably don't want to burn ships on a neutral
2010-10-04T14:14:52  <bhasker_> and early/mid game its better to be conservative
2010-10-04T14:15:01  <bhasker_> unless you can steal the planet
2010-10-04T14:16:11  <bhasker_> sometimes capturing neutrals behind lines can also kill you if you take it at the wrong tme and shift the ships balance to the enemy
2010-10-04T14:16:23  <bhasker_> the enemy will just punch through your front line

2010-10-04T14:18:21  <dwchandler> Migi32: I'm suggesting making a good enough scoring system so you don't have to tweak in specific rules ;-)
2010-10-04T14:18:43  <rebelxt> fleet re-direction (i.e. ability to change fleet's destination planet during flight at any time) would make Planet Wars much more complex. games would be crazy fun to watch though ;-)
2010-10-04T14:18:48  <rebelxt> i'd be curious to modify engine and bot to support this after the contest is over. anyone else interested to try this some time in December?
2010-10-04T14:19:32  <Migi32> rebelxt, I think it'd actually make the game easier
2010-10-04T14:19:43  <Migi32> you never commit any ships
2010-10-04T14:19:48  <bhasker_> i am still trying to get that right dwc :-\ sadly my heuristics need crutches at times, they make the bot do stupid things otherwise
2010-10-04T14:19:51  <a1k0n> yeah, your ships are effectively invulnerable once produced
2010-10-04T14:20:01  <Migi32> you can send them out, as long as they don't reach half-way you risk nothing
2010-10-04T14:20:09  <dwchandler> I keep messing with thing in my heuristic based bot, and everything I try is better in some situations and worse in others

2010-10-04T14:21:22  <rebelxt> migi32, interesting point, at a first glance it feels more complex.. Galcon allows fleet re-direction. really interesting dynamic games
2010-10-04T14:21:33  <a1k0n> unless it's calculated based on the underlying uncomputable value function of the game

That was a bit complex, but I think he could have gotten the same result by hammering one planet or the other.  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5424973

2010-10-04T14:34:01  <rebelxt> coventry:  i used to hammer one planet but found it's better to attack multiple planets at the same time. even some high level bots will not defend very effectively and send ships on unnecessarily long routes sometimes.

2010-10-04T14:35:23  <mega1> but the mixed strategy part should be as long as the game
2010-10-04T14:35:55  <McLeopold> coventry: he at least looks far enough to calc for incoming fleets.
2010-10-04T14:36:08  <coventry> McLeopold: Yep.
2010-10-04T14:36:39  <coventry> Thanks for the discussion, everyone.
2010-10-04T14:36:56  <jmcarthur> that doesn' necessarily mean that dmj simulates the game that deeply
2010-10-04T14:37:32  <jmcarthur> it may be that he has a heuristic or some simple graph algorithm that speculates on the number of ships at various places later in the game without actually simulating much
2010-10-04T14:39:10  <a1k0n> it isn't that hard to simulate, and it doesn't take all that much memory.
2010-10-04T14:39:45  <a1k0n> anyway i'm going to shut my trap until this bot stops failing assertions
2010-10-04T14:40:24  <jmcarthur> it depends on if you are branching the simulation

2010-10-04T14:46:41  <a1k0n> yeah i assumed from the start i'd want to do some game tree searching of some kind so write it up in C++
2010-10-04T14:47:04  <McLeopold> a1k0n: did you get past your assertions?
2010-10-04T14:47:15  <a1k0n> Assertion failed: (planets[src].frames[timestep].owner == 1+player), function undo_move, file MyBot.cc, line 223.
2010-10-04T14:47:37  <jmcarthur> if i can get away with using GHC HEAD (meaning binary submissions) i can get speeds on par with C. if not, i will probably have to rewrite in C :\
2010-10-04T14:47:42  <a1k0n> hmm that might mean my implementation is forever screwed
2010-10-04T14:48:05  <rebelxt> Migi32, i'm not even simulating enemy's future actions. just trying to figure out best possible action plan for each turn is getting computationally intensive (a lot of what-if simulations)
2010-10-04T14:48:44  <Migi32> oh ok, I just asked cause you said "branching"
2010-10-04T14:48:55  <Migi32> and assumed some kind of tree search
2010-10-04T14:49:21  <rebelxt> Migi32, yeah sorry about confusion - not game tree search
2010-10-04T14:49:32  <Migi32> no worries :D
2010-10-04T14:50:46  <McLeopold> has anyone actually tried search trees?
2010-10-04T14:51:06  <jmcarthur> looks like a1k0n is, based on that assertion failure he pasted
2010-10-04T14:51:33  <jmcarthur> i'm doing a search algorithm
2010-10-04T14:51:37  <McLeopold> I've got an undo, but it's more for juggling order around finding the best use of resources.
2010-10-04T14:51:53  <jmcarthur> that still sounds like a (shallow) search tree to me

2010-10-04T14:52:30  <McLeopold> It seems like there would be far too many at every turn to even go 1 ply
2010-10-04T14:52:30  <jmcarthur> in the context of my bot, that's a tough question to answer directly
2010-10-04T14:53:05  <McLeopold> Even if you eliminated partial fleets into neutrals.  It's a lot.
2010-10-04T14:53:20  <jmcarthur> my search is partially stochastic
2010-10-04T14:53:50  <McLeopold> Can you beat Rage with it?

2010-10-04T15:00:13  <jmcarthur> i think the server should be pretty good about invalid orders, so that one is probably you
2010-10-04T15:00:23  <Frontier> Right now I calculate the planet's scores first and calculate the attack/defend fleet requirements afterwards. I wonder if I should feed back the estimated ressource need into the scoring function until it ... stabilizes ... or so... dunno.
2010-10-04T15:00:29  <jmcarthur> it's the timeouts that i blame the server on, mainly

2010-10-04T15:41:24  <cfaftw> that's a shame :(
2010-10-04T15:41:59  <delt0r_> well in truth a lot do lurk
2010-10-04T15:42:16  <delt0r_> but just lurk for an answer...
2010-10-04T15:42:25  <cfaftw> yeah i sat here for a minute and noticed no chatter
2010-10-04T15:42:33  <cfaftw> i just came to talk about this game
2010-10-04T15:42:57  <cfaftw> for some reason i have a hunch that there should be a "best" move regardless of what your opponent does during that same turn
2010-10-04T15:43:11  <cfaftw> meaning, it seems like there should be a provably optimal bot
2010-10-04T15:43:16  <cfaftw> i'm just not smart enough to figure it out
2010-10-04T15:43:50  <cfaftw> i think it's possible to build a bot that will stalemate against itself, but win against a bot that does anything differently (given enough turns)
2010-10-04T15:44:00  <cfaftw> but i could be wrong
2010-10-04T15:44:50  <delt0r_> cfaftw: since there is perfect knowledge -there is a "nash" equilibrium... or a best move i guess... however i belive its perhaps intractable to find it... like chess or go
2010-10-04T15:45:20  <cfaftw> yeah i noticed it's a zero-sum game
2010-10-04T15:45:36  <delt0r_> I think competative....
2010-10-04T15:45:55  <delt0r_> but i haven't done game theory for a year or two
2010-10-04T15:46:15  <cfaftw> my knowledge of game theory is limited to wikipedia perusings :)
2010-10-04T15:46:37  <delt0r_> ie your are maxamizing your score... but the total score does not sum to a constant
2010-10-04T15:46:56  <cfaftw> ahhh

2010-10-04T15:47:24  <cfaftw> however, once all planets are possesed by either player, it becomes a zero-sum game, correct?
2010-10-04T15:48:13  <delt0r_> no--you have a turn limit.....
2010-10-04T15:48:16  <delt0r_> and income
2010-10-04T15:48:19  <delt0r_> ships matter
2010-10-04T15:48:20  <optimum> it's not strictly a zero-sum game unless you are talking about win or loss
2010-10-04T15:49:54  <delt0r_> my understanding is that if the criteron that you win on... sums to a constant thrughout the game... its zero sum
2010-10-04T15:50:17  <cfaftw> ok
2010-10-04T15:50:23  <delt0r_> if you are just tring to maximize a score and the sum of score is not constant over the game --its competiative
2010-10-04T15:50:24  <cfaftw> yeah it's not zero sum
2010-10-04T15:50:26  <cfaftw> i was mistaken
2010-10-04T15:50:46  <delt0r_> some moves are good for you--but not bad for the enemy
2010-10-04T15:51:14  <delt0r_> while in zero sum games... any move that imporves your score... must decrease your enemys score
2010-10-04T15:52:06  <delt0r_> since this has "elemination" of the enemy --then i can't remember....

2010-10-04T16:01:35  <McLeopold> The scenario needs tweaking, but I think it could be made to be a 50% 50% chance of winning.

2010-10-04T16:01:58  <justin_pdx> If the system is in balance than a draw is the result of perfect play on both sides.

2010-10-04T16:03:28  <McLeopold> cfaftw: yes
2010-10-04T16:03:51  <justin_pdx> Unless the population of the planet is < growth_rate * travel_time between the starting planets.
2010-10-04T16:03:56  <McLeopold> and the opponents are the same distance, meaning no time to react
2010-10-04T16:04:01  <justin_pdx> In which case both planets should instantly attack it.
2010-10-04T16:06:13  <McLeopold> But if you opponent instantly attacks you, your gone.
2010-10-04T16:06:24  <optimum> someone was saying that he could formulate the optimal strategy in terms of a linear program... that would tend to indicate that it can be found in polynomial time
2010-10-04T16:06:56  <cfaftw> which someone?

2010-10-04T16:09:11  <Migi32> optimum, no i wasn't. I was suggesting a minimax search in which the value of each node would be defined by a linear program
2010-10-04T16:09:11  <cfaftw> mcleopold, oh i missed that
2010-10-04T16:09:21  <justin_pdx> For example in this two planet system A can never capture B:    ( A:100 ships, 5 growth ) <--- 10 travel time ---> ( B: 50 ships, 5 growth )
2010-10-04T16:09:46  <justin_pdx> A will always have more ships, but it can never capture B.

2010-10-04T16:10:40  <Migi32> justin_pdx, wrong. due to gravity those 2 planets will attract each other, making the travel time shorter :P
2010-10-04T16:10:58  <McLeopold> Migi32: they are a binary system. :)
2010-10-04T16:10:59  <Migi32> eventually :P
2010-10-04T16:11:00  <amstan> lol, moving planets?
2010-10-04T16:11:20  <cfaftw> that would make things difficult
2010-10-04T16:11:22  <Janzert> ahh, but the universe ends (turn limit) before gravity can show its effects
2010-10-04T16:11:39  <amstan> that would be hilarious
2010-10-04T16:11:40  <justin_pdx> Actually space is expanding, meaning that the speed of light is reducing and travel time is increasing.

2010-10-04T16:15:56  <rebelxt> hopefully someone finds it useful - feedback is very welcome!..

2010-10-04T16:18:29  <cfaftw> rebelxt: i did mean that, but then imagined winning with a ridiculous bot
2010-10-04T16:19:10  <cfaftw> cfaftw, it would be incredible for somebody to win the contest then release the source code as being just a few lines of simple code

2010-10-04T16:22:38  <justin_pdx> I think that human concepts, heuristics and approximations increase the LOC count.
2010-10-04T16:22:41  <Migi32> yeah I not only flag my code with // TODO but also // WTF
2010-10-04T16:23:06  <justin_pdx> The more assumptions and restrictions you try to explain to your bot the more conditionals and naturally LOC you have.
2010-10-04T16:23:15  <rebelxt>  /WTF is the best comment ever
2010-10-04T16:23:32  <justin_pdx> But I think the winning bots will have little more than iterators and state analysis algorithms.
2010-10-04T16:24:01  <Migi32> justin_pdx, I believe the winning bot will use a mixture of multiple strategies, so I disagre
2010-10-04T16:24:03  <Migi32> e
2010-10-04T16:24:06  <rebelxt> justin_pdx: seems like utilities code is easily in 500-1000 LOC range already
2010-10-04T16:24:20  <foucist> say you code for neutral sniping, then someone goes meta-neutral sniping, so you go meta-meta-neutral sniping
2010-10-04T16:24:38  <justin_pdx> Doesn't exist.
2010-10-04T16:25:00  <rebelxt> Migi32: i think you are right.. thinking of netflix prize winners who blended 100+ algorithms (!) to win the grand prize
2010-10-04T16:25:14  <Migi32> netflix?
2010-10-04T16:25:18  <foucist> going meta meta with all the conditionals etc, probably would end up losing to a simpler bot
2010-10-04T16:25:36  <foucist> like the prisoner dilemma winning bot
2010-10-04T16:25:58  <justin_pdx> rebelxt: I bet the utilities libraries are useful, but probably are used for deriving not necessarily the most useful information.
2010-10-04T16:26:05  <rebelxt> Migi32: yeah 1 mil $ netflix prize contest (predicting movie ratings using collaborative filtering)
2010-10-04T16:26:33  <justin_pdx> Good for debugging, analysis, etc.  But a core math bot can probably ignore most approximations and handle the data raw.
2010-10-04T16:26:53  <Migi32> woah rebelxt I totally missed that
2010-10-04T16:27:33  <rebelxt> justin_pdx: well, agreed, i ended up no longer using some of the util code written for early versions of the bot...
2010-10-04T16:28:31  <Migi32> I think it's important to have really good fundamentals / utility functions so you reduce the number of lines of code of your actual bot logic
2010-10-04T16:29:04  <rebelxt> Migi32: it was a lot of fun, but got out of hand - never ending algorithm arms race which lasted for 2+ years. blending 100+ algorithms to win the contest was insane...
2010-10-04T16:30:24  <Migi32> what do you expect? $100000 dollars!
2010-10-04T16:31:11  <rebelxt> yep $ 1 000 000
2010-10-04T16:31:43  <justin_pdx> Is this prize in this current contest just bragging rights?

2010-10-04T16:53:01  <cfaftw> are most of you using your bot names as your nicks?
2010-10-04T16:53:18  <jmcarthur> i'm still working on whittling my thoughts down to a simple scenario
2010-10-04T16:53:28  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: i will answer you once i've done that ^^
2010-10-04T16:54:00  <Migi32> Minecraft is just so evil. You just have some fun doing random stuff on your first day, quickly build a shelter for your first night, you like your shelter and BAM, you're hooked. From that point on your shelter will only get bigger and bigger.
2010-10-04T16:54:03  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, oh... i was just looking for you to explain your hunch
2010-10-04T16:54:14  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: i'd rather just prove it ;)

2010-10-04T16:59:35  <Migi32> cfaftw, there are some rock-paper-scissor mechanics in the game. Very subtle, but they're there, so draw between optimal bots is unlikely

2010-10-04T17:00:02  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: no
2010-10-04T17:00:21  <McLeopold> hmm.. think risk, but better
2010-10-04T17:00:30  <McLeopold> I've got a good article for you...
2010-10-04T17:01:07  <cfaftw> migi32, gotcha.
2010-10-04T17:02:28  <Migi32> jmcarthur, RageBot made me see: RageBot < expanding with such a number of ships that you can hold against RageBot < expanding with all ships < RageBot

2010-10-04T17:03:51  <McLeopold> that's the second part
2010-10-04T17:03:58  <McLeopold> I'm looking for the first
2010-10-04T17:04:57  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: http://www.diplom.org/Zine/F1995M/Dreier/Endgame.html
2010-10-04T17:05:03  <jmcarthur> i'll check it out
2010-10-04T17:05:24  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: okay, the summary is, sometimes you look even, but your win prob is about 1
2010-10-04T17:05:43  <McLeopold> I'm starting to think planet wars will be this way
2010-10-04T17:06:01  <jmcarthur> you mean the probability that it's not a draw?
2010-10-04T17:06:06  <McLeopold> Yes
2010-10-04T17:06:09  <Migi32> I played Diplomacy once, as Austria, I was dead on the fifth or so turn XD
2010-10-04T17:06:14  <jmcarthur> yeah, that is also my suspicion
2010-10-04T17:06:18  <optimum> Migi32: seeing how i studied political science in college, i'm sure i won't win the contest
2010-10-04T17:06:35  <jmcarthur> but i still can't seem to prove it!
2010-10-04T17:06:55  <McLeopold> Migi32: austria's hard, you usually have to ally with italy to have a chance
2010-10-04T17:07:23  <Migi32> well my genious move was to backstab italy on the first move :P
2010-10-04T17:07:30  <Migi32> didn't turn out great :P
2010-10-04T17:07:52  <McLeopold> Migi32: no, backstabbing can't happen until you know they will die, and only after the neutral are gone.
2010-10-04T17:08:41  <Migi32> hmm, it was a long time ago, I don't remember much of it
2010-10-04T17:08:53  <Migi32> you seem to play diplomacy quite a lot, McLeopold
2010-10-04T17:09:02  <McLeopold> I have.  I'm quite good.
2010-10-04T17:09:31  <cfaftw> alright, it's quittin time! meaning time to go home and work on my bot at some point.
2010-10-04T17:09:36  <McLeopold> Planet Wars would be similar, if it was multi-player.
2010-10-04T17:09:42  <cfaftw> later

2010-10-04T17:10:36  <McLeopold> It would be interesting and fun if you could signal an opponent to help you defeat a third opponent.
2010-10-04T17:10:43  <Migi32> McLeopold, GalCon is multi-play PlanetWars. It's in fact also a kind of diplomacy, but without typing/discussing, just provoking and (not) reacting
2010-10-04T17:10:49  <McLeopold> Then you'd have to worry about the backstab.
2010-10-04T17:11:31  <McLeopold> I've always preferred no-press diplomacy.
2010-10-04T17:15:26  <jmcarthur> god this game is so complicated
2010-10-04T17:16:10  <jmcarthur> i'm trying to map out some moves for just three planets with only 1 ship on the starting planets, no neutral ships, and low growth rates
2010-10-04T17:16:10  <McLeopold> planet wars?
2010-10-04T17:16:27  <McLeopold> what's your map?
2010-10-04T17:16:32  <jmcarthur> complex to analyze, i mean
2010-10-04T17:16:48  <nullkuhl> Hello, approximately after how many games, my bot would reach it's fair ELO Score ?
2010-10-04T17:17:13  <jmcarthur> Starting planets 2 turns from each other with 1 ship and 1 growth. A neutral planet 2 turns from both starting planets with no ships and 2 growth.
2010-10-04T17:17:18  <McLeopold> nullkuhl: I think about 10-15
2010-10-04T17:17:21  <Janzert> nullkuhl: figure somewhere around 20 usually
2010-10-04T17:17:53  <jmcarthur> nullkuhl: that would be easier to say with certainty if the server would just show confidence intervals :(
2010-10-04T17:19:22  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I think I'd go for the neutral and abandon my home.
2010-10-04T17:19:56  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: are you doing a game tree?
2010-10-04T17:21:13  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: it seems like a game of chicken, first person to stop going for the neutral losses
2010-10-04T17:21:37  <nullkuhl> McLeopold: sorry to interrupt but what do you mean by a game tree here...
2010-10-04T17:22:10  <McLeopold> nulkuhl: at the opening, each player has 3 moves, hold, neutral or enemy. so 9 opening combos
2010-10-04T17:22:24  <McLeopold> nullhuhl: the next turn is more complicated
2010-10-04T17:23:17  <antimatroid2> McLeopold: is your main server bot using a tree or still heuristic based?
2010-10-04T17:23:34  <antimatroid2> i've started the construction of the code for a tree, but still working out the finer details with a comb
2010-10-04T17:23:37  <McLeopold> no trees, pure calculation
2010-10-04T17:23:42  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i also think it looks like a game of chicken. it was originally a more complicated scenario. every time i distill it down to look for a game requiring a mixed strategy (not resulting in a draw every time), i end up with the game just being a draw
2010-10-04T17:24:15  <jmcarthur> i am certain intuitively that there exists a simple scenario that will not end up with a draw with optimal play on part of both players, but i can't find it :\
2010-10-04T17:24:29  <antimatroid2> jmcarthur: i agree with that
2010-10-04T17:24:30  <McLeopold> I'm looking for it too
2010-10-04T17:25:22  <McLeopold> what about 1 ship on the neutral?
2010-10-04T17:26:05  <McLeopold> that would probably mean wait 1 turn, then go for neutral.
2010-10-04T17:26:08  <nullkuhl> antimatroid2: main server ? is there a secondary server that people try their bots on ?
2010-10-04T17:26:09  <jmcarthur> i'm guessing that would end up being both wait for a turn and then keep going for neutral
2010-10-04T17:26:10  <McLeopold> still draw...
2010-10-04T17:26:14  <McLeopold> haha
2010-10-04T17:26:30  <McLeopold> we think alike
2010-10-04T17:26:32  <Zannick> the problem is, if you're using a symmetric map, then by symmetry a nonlosing strategy for one player has to also be a nonlosing strategy for the other player
2010-10-04T17:27:18  <Zannick> this is assuming deterministic play, of course
2010-10-04T17:27:24  <jmcarthur> Zannick: but if it's a mixed strategy then... yeah that :)
2010-10-04T17:27:49  <jmcarthur> optimal does not necessarily imply nonlosing, is what i'm attempting to demonstrate
2010-10-04T17:27:58  <Zannick> it will be on average even

2010-10-04T17:28:38  <McLeopold> jmcarthur, 1 ship on neutral, growth 1
2010-10-04T17:28:43  <nullkuhl> McLeopold: yes, i can see you tree , starting by a move where u attack an enemy, neutral or u hold,  but what if you attack neutral and enemy at the same turn
2010-10-04T17:29:20  <McLeopold> nullkuhl: all combinations of moves are considered at 1 ply
2010-10-04T17:30:16  <nullkuhl> yes so how does that make a tree, i mean for example in the first turn, you could hold, or attack 1 enemy or attack 1 neutral or attack n neutrals
2010-10-04T17:31:14  <McLeopold> nullkuhl: the tree is made after you pick a move combination, then generate the next set of move combinations from that board
2010-10-04T17:32:16  <a1k0n> nullkuhl: http://www.sifflez.org/misc/tronbot/
2010-10-04T17:32:26  <a1k0n> (by analogy)
2010-10-04T17:32:58  <nullkuhl> a1k0n: am familiar with minmax algorithm however i cant imagine how will planet wars map into a tree or so
2010-10-04T17:33:17  <Zannick> planet wars in general maps very badly into a tree
2010-10-04T17:33:19  <nullkuhl> McLeopold: ok ( the next set of move combinations ) will be the sub nodes of the current node i am at in the tree ?
2010-10-04T17:33:23  <a1k0n> well, instead of moving in the four directions you send your n fleets to m places.  it's a very, very, very large branching factor.
2010-10-04T17:33:30  <McLeopold> yes
2010-10-04T17:33:37  <McLeopold> but the tree will be HUGE
2010-10-04T17:33:44  <McLeopold> in a real game
2010-10-04T17:33:59  <nullkuhl> well i think that each node then could have more than 1000000 sub node
2010-10-04T17:34:03  <Janzert> If I'm looking at it right the simplest r-p-s scenario is three planets 2 distance apart, starter planets have growth 2, ships 3 and neutral has growth 3 ships 2
2010-10-04T17:34:11  <a1k0n> yep.  you don't explicitly construct such a tree in memory.
2010-10-04T17:34:35  <Zannick> 122 choose 22 is the number of possible sets of orders on the first turn, when there are 23 planets and you start with 100 ships
2010-10-04T17:34:48  <jmcarthur> Janzert: wow that is already more complex than i was hoping

2010-10-04T17:34:56  <Zannick> 9.4 x 10^23
2010-10-04T17:35:07  <McLeopold> Janzert: I think that's a draw as well
2010-10-04T17:35:13  <a1k0n> and yeah, your move depends heavily on what your opponent does, so if you implement standard minimax where player 2 gets to pick a move given player 1's move, so player 2 comes out ahead
2010-10-04T17:35:31  <a1k0n> i haven't come up with a good way to resolve that in the standard minimax search
2010-10-04T17:35:37  <a1k0n> nullkuhl: you give up.  nobody else is doing it that way. :)
2010-10-04T17:35:38  <McLeopold> Janzert: neutral is easily snipped with no threat to home planet

2010-10-04T17:36:05  <a1k0n> but i have implemented it using a backtracking search.
2010-10-04T17:36:15  <a1k0n> basically do a move, recurse, undo it
2010-10-04T17:36:23  <jmcarthur> aha

2010-10-04T17:36:50  <Janzert> McLeopold: you're right
2010-10-04T17:37:02  <Janzert> bleh, I give up for the moment then :)
2010-10-04T17:37:16  <a1k0n> McLeopold: hmm?
2010-10-04T17:37:24  <a1k0n> you want to know how many?
2010-10-04T17:37:41  <McLeopold> okay, the 3 planets are all distance 1
2010-10-04T17:37:41  <Zannick> my best idea of even trying minimax/alphabeta is to determine what the worst thing my opponent could do right now is and determine what the best way to get around that is
2010-10-04T17:38:09  <a1k0n> yeah you can probably at least find a countermove to every move without too much poking around
2010-10-04T17:38:11  <jmcarthur> maximin?
2010-10-04T17:38:40  <a1k0n> i think i implemented that and it basically thought the enemy was invulnerable and just sat there
2010-10-04T17:38:42  <McLeopold> Zannick: you have to pick the thing that doesn't lose, but leave you opponent with the biggest chance of making a mistake.
2010-10-04T17:38:59  <Zannick> McLeopold: heh
2010-10-04T17:38:59  <a1k0n> (but i probably also had bugs)

2010-10-04T17:41:03  <a1k0n> i've been trying to figure out the right way to implement that in general.
2010-10-04T17:42:00  <a1k0n> nullkuhl: most people are doing for each of my planets i, for each other planet j, what happens if i try to send <some> ships to j?  and then repeatedly do that until they're out of ships to send from i
2010-10-04T17:42:00  <McLeopold> a1k0n: it's why I think over time, all bots with tend to draw, with the better ones not making mistakes and winning over the course of more moves

2010-10-04T17:54:51  <a1k0n> make your bot Verätzungen then
2010-10-04T17:55:21  <McLeopold> nullkuhl: also, you can play multiple versions of you bot on tcp server
2010-10-04T17:55:38  <nullkuhl> McLeopold: is this documented anywhere ?

2010-10-04T17:56:27  <antimatroid2> for this example you guys are looking for, have you considering 4 planets, 2 players starting a fair distance away, then each of the other two planets being cheap and valuable, 1 move away from each centre?
2010-10-04T17:56:34  <antimatroid2> so each player has to go for one of the middle planets
2010-10-04T17:56:38  <McLeopold> maybe, i don't use it

2010-10-04T17:57:10  <nullkuhl> McLeopold: can i play against a bot of a user that i specify on the tcp server ?

2010-10-04T17:58:20  <antimatroid2> wait, no that wouldn't work, you'd both wait?

2010-10-04T18:00:03  <dwchandler> yes. fortunately that's almost always the case
2010-10-04T18:00:36  <dwchandler> tcp connects and waits for a match up. only a second or three, usually

2010-10-04T18:05:14  <dwchandler> it's fine. just don't go complete your education before starting to write code
2010-10-04T18:05:42  <dwchandler> and making a bot might give you some hints what areas of game theory to look into
2010-10-04T18:05:45  <justin_pdx> I'm pretty sure that AI and Game Theory knowledge will get you father than pure trial and error.
2010-10-04T18:05:47  <sigh> I havn't been able to apply any of the "traditional" ai techniques to this problem
2010-10-04T18:05:58  <sigh> but having a knowledge of them certainly helps
2010-10-04T18:06:08  <justin_pdx> After all the point is to learn how to solve a generalized set of problems, not just play Galcon.
2010-10-04T18:06:14  <foucist> i think being a intuitionist superman would get you farthest

2010-10-04T18:06:55  <antimatroid2> sorry, imgur seems to be down
2010-10-04T18:07:07  <justin_pdx> I would say that game theory and discrete math would be better than AI studies.  It's not a vague enough game for complex AI, imho.
2010-10-04T18:07:28  <antimatroid2> i'm a huge game theory fan and i think people will be struggling to use that as well
2010-10-04T18:08:02  <nullkuhl> justin_pdx: antimatroid2: do you know any good books explaining/discussing game thoery ?
2010-10-04T18:08:12  <antimatroid2> how much maths do you know?
2010-10-04T18:08:20  <sigh> regardless, you need to become comfortable with the heuristics that work for this game, before you can apply more sophisticated ideas
2010-10-04T18:08:25  <antimatroid2> if not much, martin osbornes, if a lot then myerson or fudenberg
2010-10-04T18:08:35  <justin_pdx> Lots of information on the web, nullkuhl.  Use wikipedia and its references as a good starting point.
2010-10-04T18:09:07  <antimatroid2> you would want to have done some analysis before picking up those later two books and expecting to understand them though
2010-10-04T18:09:53  <antimatroid2> McLeopold: any first attempts at optimal strategies in those two situations?
2010-10-04T18:09:55  <antimatroid2> i'm not positive

2010-10-04T18:10:50  <justin_pdx> What are the greater distances?  They're not labeled.
2010-10-04T18:10:56  <antimatroid2> there are 4 planets for each "map", each player starts on one of the outer planets, how do you play?

2010-10-04T18:11:04  <antimatroid2> greater distances aren't important imo
2010-10-04T18:11:10  <antimatroid2> but say 4 if you must
2010-10-04T18:11:20  <justin_pdx> Are the two in the middle neutral?
2010-10-04T18:11:21  <sigh> I would send all 100 units to the closest planet
2010-10-04T18:11:24  <antimatroid2> yes
2010-10-04T18:11:28  <sigh> in both cases
2010-10-04T18:11:30  <McLeopold> are all planets distance 4
2010-10-04T18:11:40  <antimatroid2> no, middle 2 are distanced 1
2010-10-04T18:11:41  <justin_pdx> The greater distances are very important, antimatroid2.
2010-10-04T18:11:50  <antimatroid2> not if they're equal
2010-10-04T18:11:52  <McLeopold> what sigh said
2010-10-04T18:11:59  <jmcarthur> i agree with sigh as well
2010-10-04T18:12:10  <antimatroid2> if the other player waited in 1 or send to that neutral, you lose
2010-10-04T18:12:36  <antimatroid2> whereas in 2 they only beat you if they sent to your neutral straight away
2010-10-04T18:12:46  <sigh> hmmm
2010-10-04T18:12:58  <antimatroid2> i would probably wait in 1 and send to your neutral in 2
2010-10-04T18:13:00  <McLeopold> it depends on the strength of the neutral
2010-10-04T18:13:11  <antimatroid2> s = 4 in the first and 9 in the second
2010-10-04T18:13:13  <justin_pdx> I would send ships+1 to each neutral, and then if the enemy sent 100 ships at anything, I'd attack it the next turn.
2010-10-04T18:13:58  <antimatroid2> okay, what if ship sizes were adjusted that you couldn't attempt to claim both, but situation was otherwise isomprphic?
2010-10-04T18:14:09  <antimatroid2> i think it's possible to have situations with no clear draw strategy
2010-10-04T18:14:15  <sigh> I'm not sure about s=9 anymore, for s=4 it is easy to defend by streaming full growth to the planet
2010-10-04T18:14:17  <McLeopold> antimatroid2: you can always snipe, so just wait
2010-10-04T18:14:34  <McLeopold> until, you don't have to wait, then send
2010-10-04T18:14:55  <antimatroid2> either way, the optimal strategy even for a draw switches quite a lot
2010-10-04T18:14:56  <McLeopold> It makes no difference how many planets are in the center
2010-10-04T18:15:04  <antimatroid2> i don't think anyone has that kind of detail yet?

2010-10-04T18:17:07  <sigh> yeah

2010-10-04T18:17:39  <sigh> :)
2010-10-04T18:18:15  <antimatroid2> it's not much different, just find probability distributions for each player over their moves such that one can't can't theirs to increase their expected payoff
2010-10-04T18:18:21  <antimatroid2> the maths just gets harder :P
2010-10-04T18:19:06  <antimatroid2> what if you send all your ships from home planet (including future growth) to your enemies neutral
2010-10-04T18:19:31  <antimatroid2> i guess they still beat you if they do the same to their neutral
2010-10-04T18:19:32  <antimatroid2> hmmmm
2010-10-04T18:19:46  <antimatroid2> anyway, i've gotta run, i have a lecture at 10
2010-10-04T18:19:51  <sigh> cya
2010-10-04T18:20:53  <antimatroid2> i think for 2 you really want to go for your neutral and back it up with any growth you get
2010-10-04T18:21:01  <antimatroid2> you can only stay in a draw position from doing that?
2010-10-04T18:21:05  <antimatroid2> otherwise win
2010-10-04T18:21:52  <antimatroid2> i guess it depends on whether you can do return trip to your planet in the time it takes them to get to you and if you had less starting ships at home
2010-10-04T18:22:26  <antimatroid2> i don't see how anyone plans to do well without some kind of gametree, even when you are only trying to guess at reasonable moves

2010-10-04T19:51:14  <nullkuhl> the maximum number of turns is 200 ? or is that only for now ( not for final game standings,etc.. )
2010-10-04T19:52:18  <Itkovian> nullkuhl: I think it may change. Or not. But I would not program my bot to take this into account
2010-10-04T19:55:14  <justin_pdx> Itkovian: it is marginally useful.
2010-10-04T19:55:45  <Itkovian> justin_pdx: if you could project until that turn, maybe, yes. Or am I mistaken?
2010-10-04T19:55:56  <justin_pdx> Yes.
2010-10-04T19:55:56  <justin_pdx> For example, say there was a growth 1 neutral planet with five ships on it that you could capture and the game has 10 turns left.

2010-10-04T19:57:34  <justin_pdx> There is a slightly more complicated function for determining if it's worth it against an enemy planet/

2010-10-04T22:06:54  <j3camero> Yeah I made a little script like the one we had during tron that wakes up every few minutes and nukes a bunch of old submissions.
2010-10-04T22:07:13  <j3camero> Hopefully that's problem solved.
2010-10-04T22:07:13  <amstan> j3camero: yeah.. i remember, we had space issues on that one
2010-10-04T22:07:17  <cfaftw> i'm upset i missed the tron contest
2010-10-04T22:07:18  <j3camero> Someone try submitting now.
2010-10-04T22:07:24  <amram99> it works!
2010-10-04T22:07:26  <cfaftw> i didn't hear about the ai contest until i saw this one posted on reddit
2010-10-04T22:07:27  <j3camero> Sick.
2010-10-04T22:07:34  <amram99> muchos gracias
2010-10-04T22:07:43  <j3camero> amstan saves the day by tracking me down, hehe.
2010-10-04T22:07:45  <sigh> i heard about the tron contest as the results came out :

2010-10-04T22:09:24  <cfaftw> lol
2010-10-04T22:09:32  <cfaftw> we just submitted at the same time, it seems :)
2010-10-04T22:09:37  <j3camero> So I really hope that my script works properly, and I didn't irreversibly nuke a bunch of people's bots.
2010-10-04T22:09:58  <amstan> j3camero: pastebin the query that you're running
2010-10-04T22:10:21  <amram99> might be best to move them to a different folder rather than deleting them
2010-10-04T22:10:31  <Meatkat> Yeah... what place was your old bot in?
2010-10-04T22:10:35  <amstan> amram99: you get the same problem then
2010-10-04T22:10:51  <cfaftw> 4th
2010-10-04T22:11:02  <Meatkat> j3camero: I think nuking them is perfectly acceptable
2010-10-04T22:11:13  <cfaftw> Meatkat, i have high hopes for this current submission
2010-10-04T22:11:35  <j3camero> So there's been quite an upset in the rankings lately. dmj has lost his grip on power.

2010-10-04T22:12:29  <amstan> i like how i don't even bother checking the main site anymore.. just use the bot
2010-10-04T22:12:31  <sigh> hazard uploaded a new bot, and it seems to be worse
2010-10-04T22:12:45  <cfaftw> sigh, indeed
2010-10-04T22:12:49  <amstan> sigh: or other ppl got better
2010-10-04T22:12:57  <cfaftw> sigh, i was afraid that his latest bot would be The One bot
2010-10-04T22:13:13  <cfaftw> actually.... ruilov came out of nowhere and stole 1st
2010-10-04T22:13:18  <sigh> cfaftw: haha, yeah
2010-10-04T22:13:28  <sigh> man... I need to do some work to get back into the top 10

2010-10-04T22:13:42  <davidjliu> I mean, I honestly think that Ruilov's old bot at least was a couple notches above everybody else
2010-10-04T22:13:50  <sigh> I uploaded a bot last night and I dropped form 12 to 22 :P
2010-10-04T22:13:56  <cfaftw> davidjliu, definitely
2010-10-04T22:13:59  <amstan> sigh: make that top 20, lol
2010-10-04T22:14:03  <j3camero> How do I scroll up and down in irssi?
2010-10-04T22:14:10  <amstan> j3camero: page up and down
2010-10-04T22:14:10  <sigh> amstan: I'll be in the top 20 if I upload my old bot
2010-10-04T22:14:48  <amstan> j3camero: oh yeah.. at first i tought it was a php problem, so i went in ##php
2010-10-04T22:14:52  <sigh> I just wanted to try this one out, even though it wasn't better, just different
2010-10-04T22:14:56  <amstan> they started lolling at me
2010-10-04T22:15:05  <sigh> I'm actually suprised it's at 21
2010-10-04T22:15:43  <j3camero> We need somebody to write a genetic algorithm that auto-submits bots once every hour to test different parameters. That would be ballin.
2010-10-04T22:15:54  <j3camero> Anyways, I am gonna get me some sweet sweet sleep.
2010-10-04T22:16:03  <sigh> j3camero: not enough games for good sample
2010-10-04T22:16:04  <sigh> night
2010-10-04T22:16:14  <cfaftw> why are genetic algorithms the solution to everything? lol
