2011-09-12T05:56:25  <cichociemno> Hi, I was playing a little with beta server. I have question. Is it possible to add in user preferences "time zone"? Cause I'm in Switzerland and would be really greatful it the time would be shown in local zone. I know that this is probably not so important, but please keep in mind and put somewhere at the end of your feature list. What do you think?
2011-09-12T05:57:11  <antimatroid1> i don't think so sorry
2011-09-12T05:57:26  <cichociemno> My second thought was about adding "Latest battles" in the Overwie section of menu.
2011-09-12T05:57:52  <antimatroid1> is it that hard to click the profile link? :P
2011-09-12T05:58:20  <cichociemno> Not mine battles. But the list of latest battle on server.
2011-09-12T05:58:28  <cichociemno> It's not hard;)
2011-09-12T05:59:36  <cichociemno> You know, for example there is a 250 bots ahead of you, so you would like to watch another battles ;-) At least in my case I would like;)
2011-09-12T06:01:35  <antimatroid1> oh, um not sure about that sorry
2011-09-12T06:01:50  <cichociemno> ok ;)
2011-09-12T06:02:37  <cichociemno> If I would create a branch on github, add this features, and send you a link, would you take a look and consider merge?

2011-09-12T14:08:47  <delt0r_> janzert: I think i can patch JSkills --if it is the iteration limit exception
2011-09-12T14:16:37  <janzert> delt0r_: yes, that's the exception. (note: I already bumped the limit from 100 to 1000, so we probably are really running into situations where it's just not converging or at least very slowly)
2011-09-12T14:16:50  <delt0r_> yes
2011-09-12T14:17:08  <delt0r_> in fact you are trying to break ties with the iterative solver
2011-09-12T14:17:46  <delt0r_> I am pretty confidant that just leaving it as a warning and not throwing the exception will work fine...
2011-09-12T14:18:04  <janzert> :} I haven't actually looked at what it is doing but did suspect it had to do with draws
2011-09-12T14:18:05  <delt0r_> esp if the iteration limit is bumped up to say 10k...
2011-09-12T14:18:34  <delt0r_> I can't be 100% certain... but i am confidant.
2011-09-12T14:19:00  <delt0r_> I read the paper and stuff so its not a blind guess... but i didn't go through all the code either
2011-09-12T14:20:06  <berak> but the reason for that exception still is a situation, where more than 3 players ended up with the same score, isn't it ? (and jskills doesn't like that)
2011-09-12T14:20:53  <delt0r_> its true skill in general... ie the convergance of the *approximate* iterative solver goes to zero in some cases.
2011-09-12T14:21:12  <delt0r_> but since this is just breaking ties... then its probably no bigge IMO
2011-09-12T14:21:29  <delt0r_> well almost zero... IIRC
2011-09-12T14:22:53  <delt0r_> so not trowing a exception should not affect anything like real ranks... ie if you won ... while it may break ties randomly or with a player order bias... but the final scores should not really change much at all... If i am reading everything correctly
2011-09-12T14:22:58  <janzert> I also thought before that our current draw probability setting of 0.01 seems to be making the situation worse (not to mention much lower than the actual draw probability)
2011-09-12T14:23:01  <delt0r_> it was 2 weekends ago now
2011-09-12T14:23:52  <delt0r_> I do think it is worth a test on the beta server at any rate..
2011-09-12T14:24:25  <delt0r_> otherwise its quite a lot of code to dive through for more details...
2011-09-12T14:25:25  <delt0r_> janzert: draw probability's with these models are pretty arbitrary
2011-09-12T14:25:58  <delt0r_> in fact if you really believe the model the probability of a draw is always zero... ;)
2011-09-12T14:26:20  <delt0r_> so adding a "draw" is more  of a hack to get the model matching better
2011-09-12T14:27:08  <janzert> I thought the whole measurment of "equal in skill" was equated as probability of a draw?
2011-09-12T14:27:21  <janzert> between any two given players
2011-09-12T14:27:25  <janzert> or teams
2011-09-12T14:27:51  <delt0r_> well not really since that only really gives you are 50% change of winning/losing... not really drawing per say
2011-09-12T14:29:01  <delt0r_> s/change/chance

2011-09-12T20:33:14  <Guest15027> Hello. I have a quick question: is it possible to test a PHP bot on my computer (I do have XAMPP installed so I can run PHP files via localhost)? I know how to test a python one, but not a PHP one
2011-09-12T20:37:49  <amstan> Guest15027: can you explain how you test python bots? just so we're on the same wavelength
2011-09-12T20:38:44  <Guest15027> Using the tools. Specifically play_one_game.cmd.
2011-09-12T20:38:57  <Guest15027> The paramater "python %~dp0sample_bots\python\HunterBot.py" adds one python bot into the mix
2011-09-12T20:41:03  <Guest15027> Actually, I may have solved my own problem. Let me test my solution and then get back to you
2011-09-12T20:41:05  <amstan> Guest15027: make sure you have php in your path
2011-09-12T20:41:13  <amstan> and then replace python with the name of the php executable
2011-09-12T20:41:29  <amstan> or.. you could put the whole php path in the parameter there
2011-09-12T20:44:07  <Guest15027> So it should look like: ""php %~dp0sample_bots\php\RandomBot.php"?
2011-09-12T20:45:28  <Guest15027> amstan: Because when I try it like that I get this error: replaydata.revision should be 2, but was found to be undefined!

2011-09-12T20:46:01  <amstan> Guest15027: oppen a command line, and type just "php"
2011-09-12T20:46:08  <amstan> if you get another prompt it's not cool
2011-09-12T20:46:22  <amstan> if you do, then your attempt should work, and i have no idea why it won't
2011-09-12T20:46:33  <Guest15027> 'php' is not recognized an an internal or external command
2011-09-12T20:46:36  <amstan> yeah..
2011-09-12T20:46:40  <amstan> so you must add php to your path
2011-09-12T20:47:05  <Guest15027> Environment variables right?
2011-09-12T20:47:09  <amstan> yes
2011-09-12T20:47:19  <amstan> and search in the xampp dir somewhere for php.exe
2011-09-12T20:47:37  <Guest15027> Okay, thanks for all your help
2011-09-12T20:47:44  <Guest15027> What should I name the variable though?
2011-09-12T20:47:56  <amstan> you should add stuff to the PATH variable
2011-09-12T20:48:00  <amstan> not make a new one
2011-09-12T20:48:07  <amstan> see one of these: http://www.google.ca/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&q=windows+add+to+path&oq=windows+add+to+path&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=21l21l0l212l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0
2011-09-12T20:48:43  <Guest15027> Should I add "C:\xampp\php" or "C:\xampp\php\php.exe"?
2011-09-12T20:49:38  <amstan> the folder
2011-09-12T20:50:00  <Guest15027> Okay, thank you very much for you help. I'll test it right now
2011-09-12T20:50:32  <Guest15027> And it works! Thanks again for your aid, it was very appreciated
2011-09-12T20:51:24  <amstan> any time
2011-09-12T20:52:04  <janzert> In case McLeopold happens to see this later. This has happened to the workers twice in the last 24 hours:

2011-09-12T20:54:06  <amstan> janzert: later tell?

2011-09-12T20:55:59  <janzert> ehh, not that important yet unless the rate continues at this pace
2011-09-12T20:56:54  <janzert> it happened once before and he thought it was a mysql server error caused from him working on it
2011-09-12T21:19:32  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: IMO vector spaces are not very interesting. they require too many properties
2011-09-12T21:19:52  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: maybe modules are a little more interesting
