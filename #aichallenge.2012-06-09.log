2012-06-09T16:44:07  <antimatroid> do you know what would be awesome, a game where people could submit bots and then play as a human against the bots
2012-06-09T16:44:21  <antimatroid> a good game would have humans and bots fairly well matched
2012-06-09T16:45:11  <smjms> somekind of captchas as ancient magic no robot can match

2012-06-09T16:52:41  <smjms> for example, you're in a maze, but you can program your robot to find the way out
2012-06-09T16:53:46  <smjms> or if you have two of them, make them share their information to do it quicker
2012-06-09T16:56:27  <smjms> you could upgrade your robots to gather information faster

2012-06-09T16:57:51  <smjms> with some parts that give it night vision or a laser distance meter
2012-06-09T16:59:20  <smjms> you could increase difficulty by having less of these parts and limited resources (for moving and other actions)
2012-06-09T17:08:01  <smjms> when your robot would have the the ability to differentiate objects, living things and enemies, if you have something by which you can measure distance and some weapon, you could make the robot react to the sight of enemy, if you have programmed the ballistics right

2012-06-09T17:14:08  <smjms> it could be a fun game if the API is simple enough to not get you stuck, but you could do more and much better the next time you play it
2012-06-09T17:15:47  <smjms> when you've learned some new code structures
2012-06-09T17:18:56  <smjms> maybe it would be easiest to implement as a top-view 2D adventure thing
2012-06-09T17:22:34  <smjms> http://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/14000/14436/game-maker-3.jpg the first phases of programming the bot would consist of blocks of nothing too abstract
2012-06-09T17:23:38  <smjms> yeah, that could be a fun game
