2010-11-04T00:29:56  <demerzel__> lol been checkign all my state calcs etc thinking it wasn't updating right
2010-11-04T00:30:04  <demerzel__> i had the eval func before the while loop lol
2010-11-04T00:30:28  <antimatroid1> i can't get my new moves to run without crashing
2010-11-04T00:31:44  <demerzel__> yea sorry to all the people i've crashed on today
2010-11-04T00:31:46  <demerzel__> been a rough one
2010-11-04T00:32:10  <demerzel__> i did just put in c compliance today expected a few new bugs
2010-11-04T00:32:14  <demerzel__> but there were some old ones too hah
2010-11-04T00:32:40  <antimatroid1> i'm not playing on tcp while it crashes
2010-11-04T00:33:31  <demerzel__> haha well i do keep thinking i have it fixed
2010-11-04T00:33:41  <demerzel__> not like i just go on there knowing i'm crashing ;)  i try to keep it local for that
2010-11-04T00:40:25  <antimatroid1> that doesn't even make sense
2010-11-04T00:40:42  <antimatroid1> i have the contents of a function entirely commented out, if i call it it crashes, if i don't it doesn't
2010-11-04T00:41:52  <sigh> sounds like someone is playing around in memory that he shouldn't
2010-11-04T00:43:27  <antimatroid1> hmmm
2010-11-04T00:43:31  <antimatroid1> c++ is good at letting me do that
2010-11-04T00:43:35  <sigh> finding those problems are a bitch
2010-11-04T00:43:46  <sigh> have you got any tools like valgrind?
2010-11-04T00:44:03  <antimatroid1> nope :P
2010-11-04T00:44:33  <antimatroid1> i'll check stuff iterating through objects

2010-11-04T00:46:17  <demerzel__> seriously going c-compliant was a good move on my part
2010-11-04T00:46:31  <demerzel__> you don't have to go that far obv but man i've found a lot of shit
2010-11-04T00:46:50  <sigh> demerzel__: what did you find?
2010-11-04T00:47:12  <demerzel__> well for one (that isn't necessarily c-compliance) - i access struct arrays directly which helps a ton
2010-11-04T00:47:24  <demerzel__> and forcing pointers over ref has saved me a lot of scoping trouble
2010-11-04T00:47:42  <antimatroid1> doh, it would help if i commented out implementMove rather than implementNewMove aha
2010-11-04T00:47:48  <demerzel__> no member methods and extern globals means i know where everything is at all times haha
2010-11-04T00:48:03  <sigh> antimatroid1: haha
2010-11-04T00:48:09  <demerzel__> yea probably lol

2010-11-04T00:49:17  <demerzel__> idk there are a lot of scoping problems with them even static methods do funky shit
2010-11-04T00:49:26  <demerzel__> and if you're gonna go static it doesn't hurt to make them global
2010-11-04T00:49:51  <demerzel__> i spent more time tracking down vars than actually fixing calcs
2010-11-04T00:49:55  <demerzel__> now i don't have that problem :)

2010-11-04T00:56:54  <janzert> pong
2010-11-04T00:57:12  <amstan> janzert: how would you recomend amazon ec2?
2010-11-04T00:57:32  <janzert> in what way?
2010-11-04T00:57:48  <janzert> It's great for what it is
2010-11-04T00:58:17  <janzert> I don't think I'd use it in place of say a dedicated server for a web site or such though
2010-11-04T00:58:27  <amstan> well, i'm thinking of getting a webapp, it needs lots of storage, cpu usage and bandwidth
2010-11-04T00:59:24  <janzert> the storage through s3 is probably good for quite a few situations
2010-11-04T01:00:00  <janzert> for cpu usage if it is sporadic ec2 may be great
2010-11-04T01:00:30  <janzert> for bandwidth if you can use the CDN it looks pretty good as well
2010-11-04T01:00:38  <amstan> janzert: i'm thinking of starting with this for now: http://aws.amazon.com/free/
2010-11-04T01:00:45  <amstan> yeah, i'll probably have to use CDN
2010-11-04T01:01:20  <janzert> that free package does look like a nice way to try it out
2010-11-04T01:01:53  <janzert> notice that the micro instances are pretty limited and only use EBS storage (which I have no experience with)

2010-11-04T01:02:39  <amstan> so i won't be getting the CDN with this one then?
2010-11-04T01:03:04  <janzert> you can use it, it just won't be free
2010-11-04T01:03:32  <janzert> the free "package" isn't a real package per se
2010-11-04T01:03:46  <janzert> it's is just some initial free use you are allowed
2010-11-04T01:03:57  <janzert> anything beyond those is just charged at the normal rates

2010-11-04T01:05:10  <amstan> also, how would one go about hosting the http frontend on it, do i just point my domain to their dns?
2010-11-04T01:06:39  <janzert> You would have to set up some sort of dns hosting either yourself or use one of the free ones around
2010-11-04T01:06:48  <amstan> i can do that then
2010-11-04T01:06:51  <janzert> and point it at your instance
2010-11-04T01:06:53  <amstan> but don't the ips change?
2010-11-04T01:07:44  <janzert> I've only really used spot request instances that don't hang around long, but...
2010-11-04T01:08:09  <janzert> it seems that the IP is permanently assigned to the instance as long as you keep it
2010-11-04T01:08:21  <amstan> cool
2010-11-04T01:08:27  <amstan> well, i'm sold
2010-11-04T01:09:35  <janzert> it looks like you can also get an "elastic ip" which is a static ip assigned to your account that you can use as you want
2010-11-04T01:09:51  <amstan> janzert: can i get multiple users per host?
2010-11-04T01:10:20  <janzert> you have root, so you can set it up just like you would a dedicated server basically
2010-11-04T01:10:30  <amstan> awesome

2010-11-04T02:10:02  <janzert> that's why I'd anchor it at either 0 or maybe 100
2010-11-04T02:10:12  <janzert> or some such
2010-11-04T02:10:24  <sigh> or you can just do some ridiculously high offset

2010-11-04T02:11:14  <janzert> :) at least anchoring it has some rationalization besides just making people happy
2010-11-04T02:11:17  <antimatroid1> why not 1 billion? :P
2010-11-04T02:11:52  <sigh> janzert: what's the rationalisation?
2010-11-04T02:12:47  <janzert> all the bottom bots are instant loss and it makes some sense that they should have a "defined" elo from which everything else builds up from
2010-11-04T02:13:16  <janzert> zero seems like the best but might be avoided for feelings
2010-11-04T02:13:16  <sigh> that actually makes sense
2010-11-04T02:14:01  <sigh> 0 is fine i think... I think people know that their bot is not that great if it loses every game on the first turn

2010-11-04T02:19:20  <demerzel__> i just recoded the entire thing that's basically why all these problems
2010-11-04T02:19:36  <demerzel__> but i think it's mostly under control now i think maybe 1 or 2 lingerers but all the major ones are gone finally

2010-11-04T02:21:55  <demerzel__> the loop problems have shown me i have some impressive calc power tho
2010-11-04T02:22:04  <sigh> calc power?
2010-11-04T02:22:06  <demerzel__> since essentially it was hitting the same node over and over (i only allow 1 level)
2010-11-04T02:22:16  <demerzel__> but to hit that node it had to recalc everything
2010-11-04T02:22:23  <demerzel__> it spit out like 1.8million records to log in <10 seconds
2010-11-04T02:22:57  <demerzel__> with a shitty io logger haha

2010-11-04T02:23:45  <demerzel__> i hope that means i can brute force a few levels
2010-11-04T02:23:49  <demerzel__> like i planned
2010-11-04T02:23:51  <demerzel__> we'll see :)
2010-11-04T02:24:23  <sigh> errr.... what do you count as "brute force"
2010-11-04T02:25:01  <demerzel__> not using a/b
2010-11-04T02:25:27  <sigh> yeah, but brute force implies you are doing some sort of exhaustive search
2010-11-04T02:25:42  <sigh> what exactly are you exhaustively searching?
2010-11-04T02:25:51  <demerzel__> move hierarchies
2010-11-04T02:26:13  <demerzel__> or trees if you prefer
2010-11-04T02:26:36  <demerzel__> i am still defining what a move will be tho
2010-11-04T02:26:37  <sigh> sure, but I doubt you are searching all the moves....
2010-11-04T02:26:40  <sigh> yeah, fair enough
2010-11-04T02:26:47  <demerzel__> well all the moves would be 1-X ships to every other planet
2010-11-04T02:27:03  <demerzel__> i did try that on my first bot it did ok but was wasted most of the time
2010-11-04T02:27:12  <demerzel__> can at least lowerbound to ships+1 or defense
2010-11-04T02:27:44  <sigh> even lower bounding gives a ridiculous number
2010-11-04T02:27:45  <demerzel__> mostly i am tryign to figure out if i want to consider trees as sequential or immediate
2010-11-04T02:28:21  <demerzel__> i managed 1-x in C# - granted only 1 ply but that was close to 2000 * 23!
2010-11-04T02:29:04  <sigh> wow, I'm actually suprised you got 1 ply
2010-11-04T02:29:29  <demerzel__> i optimized the shit out of it but it never timed out

2010-11-04T02:29:42  <demerzel__> i dropped that model tho cuz it was my entire turn practically
2010-11-04T02:29:58  <demerzel__> not much gain over lowerbounding - if any
2010-11-04T02:30:03  <demerzel__> although it auto-defended etc which was nice
2010-11-04T02:31:25  <demerzel__> i wonder what mega1 uses for dist
2010-11-04T02:31:33  <demerzel__> auto heuristic calc like everybody else or not
2010-11-04T02:31:41  <demerzel__> trying to figure out a way to make it part of evals

2010-11-04T04:24:28  <Error323> morning all
2010-11-04T04:25:32  <bhasker> morning
2010-11-04T04:25:42  <bhasker> well its more like 1:30am for me
2010-11-04T04:28:00  <Error323> lol
2010-11-04T04:28:02  <Error323> oef
2010-11-04T04:28:09  <Error323> 9:25 here :P
2010-11-04T04:28:24  <Error323> bhasker: it seems our bots have equal strength atm
2010-11-04T04:28:29  <Error323> cool
2010-11-04T04:28:31  <bhasker> pretty much yea
2010-11-04T04:28:41  <bhasker> though i am still tinkering with it
2010-11-04T04:28:44  <Error323> but eventually i will kick ur ass ofc ^^
2010-11-04T04:28:49  <Error323> so am i son :P
2010-11-04T04:28:50  <bhasker> hehe you just might
2010-11-04T04:29:01  <bhasker> my bot isn't geting much smarter anymore
2010-11-04T04:29:14  <bhasker> example http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=849487
2010-11-04T04:29:32  <Error323> ouch
2010-11-04T04:29:45  <Error323> it seems you win more often of me, but lose more of the others too
2010-11-04T04:30:02  <Error323> which is really funny
2010-11-04T04:30:08  <bhasker> yea:-\
2010-11-04T04:30:13  <bhasker> i make some very elementary mistakes
2010-11-04T04:30:16  <bhasker> with staging
2010-11-04T04:30:20  <bhasker> which screws me oer
2010-11-04T04:30:21  <bhasker> over*
2010-11-04T04:30:28  <bhasker> either i overextend on turn 1
2010-11-04T04:30:32  <bhasker> or stage to the wrong planet
2010-11-04T04:30:41  <bhasker> and the moment either of them happens
2010-11-04T04:30:43  <bhasker> i get wtfpwned
2010-11-04T04:32:20  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-04T04:32:28  <Error323> staging is very hard to do well
2010-11-04T04:32:43  <Error323> i'm taking a very naive KISS approach atm
2010-11-04T04:32:47  <bhasker> which is
2010-11-04T04:32:50  <Error323> which I might wanna look into
2010-11-04T04:33:14  <Error323> compute the frontline, send ships to closest frontline planet through hubs
2010-11-04T04:33:23  <Error323> though telling you this stuff is prolly not wise ^^
2010-11-04T04:33:51  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=849664
2010-11-04T04:33:53  <bhasker> hah
2010-11-04T04:33:57  <bhasker> same bug
2010-11-04T04:34:03  <bhasker> i really need to factor in ships in future
2010-11-04T04:34:10  <bhasker> i could have sniped the middle
2010-11-04T04:34:14  <bhasker> if i didnt stage
2010-11-04T04:34:26  <bhasker> since i was sending ships i never had enough ships to snipe
2010-11-04T04:34:41  <Error323> oh man indd
2010-11-04T04:35:33  <Error323> currently 46 @ official
2010-11-04T04:35:37  <Error323> been playing all night
2010-11-04T04:35:44  <Error323> 1 loss so far ^^
2010-11-04T04:35:50  <Error323> and one in the beginning -.-

2010-11-04T04:36:10  <Error323> I have high hopes :P
2010-11-04T04:36:32  <bhasker> nice
2010-11-04T04:36:58  <Error323> well it'll also represent ur bot :D
2010-11-04T04:37:14  <Error323> bhasker: where was your current official ranked at tcp
2010-11-04T04:37:27  <Error323> so i can get a sort of feeling where this will end up
2010-11-04T04:37:36  <bhasker> #31 odd
2010-11-04T04:37:44  <bhasker> 32
2010-11-04T04:37:50  <bhasker> you should probably go higher
2010-11-04T04:37:52  <Error323> ehh srry wrong question, what elo
2010-11-04T04:38:03  <bhasker> 3804
2010-11-04T04:38:03  <Error323> :)
2010-11-04T04:38:10  <Error323> no i mean on tcp ^_^
2010-11-04T04:38:15  <bhasker> oh
2010-11-04T04:38:30  <bhasker> like 5 points above yours
2010-11-04T04:38:43  <bhasker> but my tcp version is different from my official
2010-11-04T04:38:45  <bhasker> so not sure
2010-11-04T04:39:05  <Error323> yeah i mean where the current official ranked at tcp if it were playing.
2010-11-04T04:39:29  <Error323> if let say that was around 300
2010-11-04T04:39:41  <Error323> then i can safely say that i will go quite some points higher
2010-11-04T04:40:03  <bhasker> no idea where it would be
2010-11-04T04:40:12  <bhasker> i don't even remember the revision number of the submission bot lol
2010-11-04T04:40:15  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-04T04:40:24  <Error323> ohw
2010-11-04T04:40:28  <Error323> use git ^_^
2010-11-04T04:40:34  <Error323> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=849725 you rlly need to fix this
2010-11-04T04:41:28  <bhasker> yea lol
2010-11-04T04:41:30  <bhasker> :(
2010-11-04T04:41:37  <bhasker> stupid thing keeps going for enemy first
2010-11-04T04:41:38  <bhasker> over neutrals
2010-11-04T04:41:50  <bhasker> need to adjust my scoring to factor in support from neutrals
2010-11-04T04:42:04  <bhasker> that way it won't think that it can acquire the enemy
2010-11-04T04:42:06  <bhasker> planet
2010-11-04T04:42:43  <Error323> i actually created a very sweet/accurate decision system on when to snipe yesterday
2010-11-04T04:42:59  <Error323> that's one of the reasons i went 80 points up in elo over 16.0

2010-11-04T10:11:10  <phreeza> i don't want to move about the map

2010-11-04T10:16:23  <phreeza> ok give me a minute
2010-11-04T10:18:59  <antimatroid1> does it happen when there exists more than one bijective map and you don't get the same both ways?
2010-11-04T10:19:12  <antimatroid1> i would imagine you could fix that by enforcing planet numbering?
2010-11-04T10:19:23  <antimatroid1> min sum of both planet numbers added or something
2010-11-04T10:20:02  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i guess that can still tie break
2010-11-04T10:20:03  <antimatroid1> ummmm...
2010-11-04T10:20:44  <antimatroid1> you could use map 1 as that which minimises average distance, but even that can tie

2010-11-04T10:27:32  <mega1> that's the old one
2010-11-04T10:27:37  <phreeza> antimatroid1: http://twitpic.com/33twm8
2010-11-04T10:27:47  <mega1> oh, yes
2010-11-04T10:28:28  <antimatroid1> phreeza: what do you want the mapping to be?
2010-11-04T10:28:44  <phreeza> damn should have added numbers :)
2010-11-04T10:28:55  <antimatroid1> do it in paint? :P
2010-11-04T10:28:56  <phreeza> so let the blue ones be a1..a3
2010-11-04T10:29:00  <phreeza> from top to bottom
2010-11-04T10:29:01  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-11-04T10:29:14  <phreeza> and b1 top left
2010-11-04T10:29:17  <phreeza> b2 right
2010-11-04T10:29:20  <phreeza> b3 bottom
2010-11-04T10:29:27  <antimatroid1> terrible :P
2010-11-04T10:29:30  <antimatroid1> b should be blue
2010-11-04T10:29:36  <phreeza> doh!
2010-11-04T10:29:38  <phreeza> :D
2010-11-04T10:30:00  <antimatroid1> go on, with your naming convention :P
2010-11-04T10:30:28  <phreeza> anyway, greedy will map a1->b1 a2->b3 a3->b2
2010-11-04T10:31:05  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-11-04T10:31:06  <phreeza> but it should be an->bn
2010-11-04T10:31:20  <antimatroid1> hmmmm
2010-11-04T10:31:27  <antimatroid1> would dp do it?
2010-11-04T10:31:33  <antimatroid1> dp == dynamic programming
2010-11-04T10:31:56  <antimatroid1> that might be your best bet
2010-11-04T10:32:03  <phreeza> probably somehow... but i don't know how to adapt the algos i know to that problem
2010-11-04T10:32:05  <antimatroid1> mega1: any suggestions
2010-11-04T10:32:12  <phreeza> should read up on that
2010-11-04T10:32:25  <mega1> is it the planet mapping problem still?
2010-11-04T10:32:29  <phreeza> thats what i used for my knapsack bot in the early days :)
2010-11-04T10:32:34  <phreeza> yes

2010-11-04T10:32:42  <antimatroid1> just use back recursion, for planet 1 find best planets, then for planet 2 find best with planet 1's best and then work your way through
2010-11-04T10:33:10  <antimatroid1> tbh my cs education is fairly poor
2010-11-04T10:33:10  <mega1> my gut feeling is that it's equivalent to the traveling salesman
2010-11-04T10:33:33  <mega1> in complexity, at least :-)
2010-11-04T10:33:58  <phreeza> that would be bad news :)
2010-11-04T10:34:01  <phreeza> :(
2010-11-04T10:34:19  <antimatroid1> you have 23 planets, you need to do it how often?
2010-11-04T10:34:20  <mega1> you only need a very solution, right?
2010-11-04T10:34:25  <mega1> *very good
2010-11-04T10:34:44  <phreeza> yes
2010-11-04T10:35:26  <mega1> then perturb the greedy solution
2010-11-04T10:35:32  <mega1> simulated annealing comes to mind
2010-11-04T10:35:53  <phreeza> ah... thats an interesting idea
2010-11-04T10:36:33  <antimatroid1> the word "perturbation" just reminds me of calculus of variations
2010-11-04T10:36:49  <antimatroid1> given every damn proof was like, okay now perturb our functional
2010-11-04T10:36:58  <phreeza> antimatroid1: physicist?
2010-11-04T10:37:09  <antimatroid1> cs, economics and maths student
2010-11-04T10:37:13  <antimatroid1> just finishing up my undergrad now
2010-11-04T10:37:27  <phreeza> though it might be that if there are local minima in these clusters
2010-11-04T10:37:34  <phreeza> ah ok
2010-11-04T10:37:45  <phreeza> i am a phys student, thats why i ask ;)
2010-11-04T10:37:56  <antimatroid1> i have quite a few of them as friends :P
2010-11-04T10:38:09  <phreeza> cool
2010-11-04T10:38:37  <antimatroid1> the maths and physics departments at my uni are pretty much one in the same
2010-11-04T10:38:45  <mega1> is this to generalize in strategy space?
2010-11-04T10:38:58  <mega1> similarity function over maps?

2010-11-04T10:39:10  <antimatroid1> phreeza: was it you that was talking about trying to set up equivalence classes between maps?
2010-11-04T10:39:12  <phreeza> i want to have a ddatabase of precedents
2010-11-04T10:39:19  <phreeza> yes
2010-11-04T10:39:41  <phreeza> so to do that i want to do clustering on the maps
2010-11-04T10:39:42  <antimatroid1> any love?
2010-11-04T10:39:58  <phreeza> its just a bunch of thought in my head really
2010-11-04T10:40:07  <phreeza> started actually coding last night
2010-11-04T10:40:15  <phreeza> nothing running yet
2010-11-04T10:40:27  <phreeza> but i'm looking forward to datamining the game logs
2010-11-04T10:40:28  <phreeza> :)
2010-11-04T10:41:01  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't have a clue how to do anything like that
2010-11-04T10:41:28  <phreeza> i read a couple of papers on case based reasoning
2010-11-04T10:41:33  <phreeza> and case based planning
2010-11-04T10:41:46  <antimatroid1> plus the tiniest change of numbers in this can change things completely
2010-11-04T10:42:10  <phreeza> yea so the idea is to have a feature vector that accounts for that
2010-11-04T10:42:19  <phreeza> won't be counting actual number of ships
2010-11-04T10:42:22  <phreeza> but stuff like
2010-11-04T10:42:35  <phreeza> is fleet a big enough to take that planet
2010-11-04T10:42:36  <phreeza> or not
2010-11-04T10:42:48  <phreeza> the responses also
2010-11-04T10:42:55  <phreeza> more of an abstract nature
2010-11-04T10:44:16  <phreeza> the thing is even in the best case this will only mimic the top bots
2010-11-04T10:44:24  <phreeza> don't see how it can get better than them ;)
2010-11-04T10:44:34  <phreeza> even that is unlikely ;)
2010-11-04T10:45:14  <antimatroid1> i'll be happy when i can consistently pound mega1
2010-11-04T10:45:28  <phreeza> hehe who wouldn't

2010-11-04T10:46:07  <phreeza> :/ i have plkenty of other stuff to work on
2010-11-04T10:48:59  <phreeza> ah i think i found somethiung on wikipedia

2010-11-04T10:49:25  <phreeza> mega1: one solution is called Hungarian Algorithm
2010-11-04T10:49:56  <mega1> heh, sorry to dissapoint
2010-11-04T10:50:59  <mega1> n^3 can be steep
2010-11-04T10:51:48  <phreeza> i'm happy its polynomial :)
2010-11-04T10:52:56  <phreeza> oO solved in 1890

2010-11-04T10:54:39  <antimatroid1> lol, i don't even want to work out how bad the complexity is for my move selection
2010-11-04T10:54:50  <antimatroid1> it'd be at least n^4 i think
2010-11-04T10:54:56  <antimatroid1> maybe
2010-11-04T10:55:00  <antimatroid1> not sure it could handle that?
2010-11-04T10:55:05  <antimatroid1> maybe it is just n^3
2010-11-04T10:55:10  <antimatroid1> i am terrible with that kind of thing :P

2010-11-04T11:15:13  <mega1> demerzel_: I have a 1 ply and a nash equilibrium 2 ply search
2010-11-04T11:15:19  <mega1> and 2 ply minimax too
2010-11-04T11:15:21  <demerzel_> really 1 ply?
2010-11-04T11:15:33  <mega1> the 1 ply is the best
2010-11-04T11:15:39  <antimatroid1> mega1: ever have luck with simultaneous games?
2010-11-04T11:15:44  <demerzel_> do you just let all 3 run and pick the best?
2010-11-04T11:15:49  <demerzel_> how do you eval the best in that case
2010-11-04T11:15:58  <demerzel_> i am almost to the point of having a stable 1 ply minimax
2010-11-04T11:16:14  <mega1> antimatroid1: not much, it's much slower and slightly worse
2010-11-04T11:16:23  <mega1> I retest it every now and then.
2010-11-04T11:16:39  <demerzel_> antimatroid: what do you mean by simultaneous games?
2010-11-04T11:16:42  <mega1> demerzel_: I run local tests of few hundred games
2010-11-04T11:16:59  <antimatroid1> demerzel_: tree approach generally drops the imperefect information part
2010-11-04T11:17:15  <demerzel_> err can you explain that a little more
2010-11-04T11:17:15  <antimatroid1> leaving it a game with sequential moves, which it is not
2010-11-04T11:17:26  <mega1> ... and mislead myself tremendously sometimes
2010-11-04T11:17:28  <demerzel_> ohh you mean sequential vs simultaneous
2010-11-04T11:17:34  <antimatroid1> yes
2010-11-04T11:17:36  <mega1> yes
2010-11-04T11:17:49  <Error323> mega1: on what type of actions is the minimax search?
2010-11-04T11:17:59  <demerzel_> i see no reason to make it simultaneous all the stuff i see about that adds several layers of complexity
2010-11-04T11:18:17  <demerzel_> i guess you have to give the enemy a minimax move to make it even tho
2010-11-04T11:18:21  <antimatroid1> it's not that hard for 2 player zero sum games unless you want mixed strategy nash equilibria
2010-11-04T11:18:48  <antimatroid1> pure strategy nash equilibria is easy enough even with n players for normal games
2010-11-04T11:18:53  <antimatroid1> mixed strategies are always where it hurts
2010-11-04T11:19:13  <demerzel_> i am slowly coming to what i believe is a pure strategy minimax

2010-11-04T11:22:51  <antimatroid1> i have a concrete time for fleets inside moves, but each move is now for a planet from time 1 into the future
2010-11-04T11:23:27  <demerzel_> well i wasn't going to ask but you guys are so far ahead
2010-11-04T11:23:38  <demerzel_> what do you count as the next move in a sequence?  arrival or same turn?
2010-11-04T11:23:48  <demerzel_> *same turn with results
2010-11-04T11:24:33  <demerzel_> i was toying with the idea of creating a tree based on sequential moves after arrival
2010-11-04T11:24:44  <demerzel_> but then i either have to have n trees or have some way to know if my current position is worse
2010-11-04T11:25:11  <antimatroid1> for a move i will use ships that i own at any planet at any time in the future, so i make one move, update and then make another move based off that information
2010-11-04T11:25:15  <antimatroid1> if that makes sense
2010-11-04T11:25:21  <demerzel_> so same turn
2010-11-04T11:25:32  <antimatroid1> sort of not really
2010-11-04T11:25:35  <antimatroid1> it does all turns at once
2010-11-04T11:25:44  <antimatroid1> although i wont go past the max distance of the map
2010-11-04T11:26:10  <demerzel_> so you use the natural depletion of resources as a progression
2010-11-04T11:26:20  <antimatroid1> ?
2010-11-04T11:26:43  <demerzel_> ie the move could be this turn or 10 turns out
2010-11-04T11:26:56  <demerzel_> if it's 10 out then it's because you don't have the resources now
2010-11-04T11:27:09  <antimatroid1> i scan through and each planet has the new amount of ships there at that time, that's what i can send from that planet at that time point
2010-11-04T11:27:10  <demerzel_> not because you specified it's 10 out
2010-11-04T11:27:19  <demerzel_> right?
2010-11-04T11:27:29  <antimatroid1> a fleet has a source, time sent and destination, whereas a move consists of many fleets but a single destination
2010-11-04T11:27:54  <antimatroid1> yeah, although i recently moved to a stack for things like that, so i add stuff later rather than earlier
2010-11-04T11:28:11  <Error323> fuuuuuuuuck yeah, i fixed my failing against noobs problem: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=853497
2010-11-04T11:28:20  <demerzel_> a stack as in a coding container or is that a game theory term too

2010-11-04T11:28:33  <demerzel_> just checking haha
2010-11-04T11:28:35  <lavalamp_> I use a stack for my orders also...
2010-11-04T11:28:37  <antimatroid1> i have lots of stacks/queues/priority queues
2010-11-04T11:28:42  <demerzel_> my definition of minmax was quite different before this
2010-11-04T11:28:58  <antimatroid1> you can do minimax differently with simultaneous games

2010-11-04T11:32:36  <demerzel_> the former would e impressive hehe
2010-11-04T11:32:46  <Error323> if you look at turn 0 - 70 i have less planets

2010-11-04T13:05:33  <Migi32> maybe those games are just him having bad luck on a rock-paper-scissor type situation

2010-11-04T13:23:25  <demerzel_> how can you even lock it down to that level
2010-11-04T13:25:24  <Migi32> mega1, what are you using to calculate the Nash equilibria? Linear programming?

2010-11-04T13:27:27  <Migi32> mega1, ah ok it returns an approximation. I wasted a lot of time with linear programming and simplex to get exact numbers.
2010-11-04T13:27:48  <mega1> no need to
2010-11-04T13:29:24  <Migi32> yea that code snippet is like at least 20 times shorter than all the code I have for it

2010-11-04T13:40:26  <bhasker> hmm not sure i understand
2010-11-04T13:40:30  <lavalamp_> how many newly available ships are there this turn? reserve them and go to the previous turn
2010-11-04T13:40:37  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-04T13:40:47  <bhasker> so when you say reserve them you add the as available?
2010-11-04T13:40:54  <bhasker> so you launch less from your initial planet?

2010-11-04T14:41:47  <demerzel_> does anyone have any links to payoff matrices as examples instead of just using prisoner's dilemna like all the ones i've seen
2010-11-04T14:42:49  <JamesMG> bummer, my C# bot has started crashing every game on the official server
2010-11-04T14:45:05  <janzert> JamesMG: hmm, link to your profile?
2010-11-04T14:45:33  <janzert> looking at the semaphores on the main server at least they look to be clear
2010-11-04T14:46:28  <JamesMG> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=10527
2010-11-04T14:46:56  <JamesMG> has crashed the last 3
2010-11-04T14:48:12  <janzert> doesn't look like it's the semaphore problem anyway. That crashes on the first turn I'm pretty sure
2010-11-04T14:48:29  <JamesMG> yeah, it used to
2010-11-04T14:48:50  <JamesMG> I'm wondering if it's actually timing out, since that code has done about 450 clean games on the TCP server
2010-11-04T14:48:57  <JamesMG> but that's more lenient time wise
2010-11-04T14:49:08  <Zannick> wow
2010-11-04T14:49:19  <Zannick> i resubmitted my bot last night when i realized i forgot to turn off logging
2010-11-04T14:49:28  <Zannick> now it is 5-0 instead of 1-8
2010-11-04T14:49:35  <janzert> yes, quite a bit more lenient
2010-11-04T14:50:06  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.158.190> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-04T14:50:13  <janzert> there is another loss by timeout as well, second loss after resubmission
2010-11-04T14:50:54  <JamesMG> ah, didn't notice that one
2010-11-04T14:51:06  <Zannick> ah, one of those games i should have lost
2010-11-04T14:51:40  <Zannick> and one was opponent didn't move on turn 1
2010-11-04T14:55:05  <JamesMG> code runs in about .1 of a second locally
2010-11-04T14:56:00  <janzert> can you try the specific situations seen in the timeouts on the main server?
2010-11-04T14:56:19  <JamesMG> yeah, I'll throw those at it and see if it's the bot
2010-11-04T14:56:42  <demerzel_> JamesMG: the spz.nofate viz has a translate to state
2010-11-04T14:56:58  <demerzel_> ie it takes the replay string and there's a button down at the bottom to spit out what the bot saw
2010-11-04T14:57:15  <demerzel_> just noticed that yesterday very useful
2010-11-04T14:57:26  <JamesMG> awesome, thanks
2010-11-04T14:58:28  <demerzel_> i can't figure out why my bot doesn't defend all the time
2010-11-04T14:58:33  <demerzel_> it's pissing me off lol
2010-11-04T14:58:42  <demerzel_> it knows when and how much
2010-11-04T14:58:43  <demerzel_> just doesn't do it
2010-11-04T14:58:48  <demerzel_> i even rigged eval to always give positive
2010-11-04T14:59:59  <lavalamp_> some orders getting popped off your stack prematurely?
2010-11-04T15:00:34  <demerzel_> not sure i'm turning on some super logging to try and track it down
2010-11-04T15:00:42  <demerzel_> it says 'hey i need 5 ships in 8 turns and yep i got em'
2010-11-04T15:00:44  <demerzel_> then doesn't do it lol
2010-11-04T15:02:18  <lavalamp_> is something higher priority taking your ships first?
2010-11-04T15:02:25  <JamesMG> only done one so far janzert, but it spits orders right back at me
2010-11-04T15:02:45  <JamesMG> let me try it on mono
2010-11-04T15:04:44  <demerzel_> well atm it's a pure value consideration
2010-11-04T15:04:49  <demerzel_> and defense would naturally have the highest value
2010-11-04T15:05:05  <demerzel_> less turns plus i dont' have to consider enemy fleet
2010-11-04T15:05:14  <demerzel_> and i doubled it anyway lol
2010-11-04T15:05:38  <demerzel_> i probably just missed a check somewhere - bot is almost ok again :)
2010-11-04T15:05:52  <lavalamp_> have you checked that you don't get NaN's out of your eval func?
2010-11-04T15:06:20  <demerzel_> yep - i don't, evals are a struct that's pre-cleared
2010-11-04T15:06:26  <lavalamp_> I had those for a while
2010-11-04T15:06:32  <demerzel_> NaNs?
2010-11-04T15:06:34  <demerzel_> i thought c would just crash
2010-11-04T15:06:56  <lavalamp_> floating point values get set to NaN if you do something invalid
2010-11-04T15:07:09  <janzert> JamesMG: could you link the spz visualizer of one of those games, I might be able to try running it on the main server and see if it reproduces there
2010-11-04T15:07:34  <JamesMG> http://www.mail-archive.com/mono-bugs@lists.ximian.com/msg25959.html
2010-11-04T15:07:39  <JamesMG> this is my current theory janzert
2010-11-04T15:07:43  <demerzel_> ah i found it
2010-11-04T15:07:46  <JamesMG> since my reader is using ReadLine
2010-11-04T15:07:53  <demerzel_> if (planet is mine and planet is enemy) { consider defense }
2010-11-04T15:07:53  <demerzel_> oops
2010-11-04T15:07:54  <lavalamp_> unless C has code to detect and crash on those, which I don't think it does
2010-11-04T15:07:56  <JamesMG> http://spz.nofate.com/planetwars/visualizer/?game_id=6615329&server=Official
2010-11-04T15:07:58  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-11-04T15:08:22  <Zannick> no, they just stay nan
2010-11-04T15:08:33  <JamesMG> I've got it crashing if I paste the state in using mono now
2010-11-04T15:08:38  <JamesMG> it's just an overflow
2010-11-04T15:08:39  <lavalamp_> yeah that's what I thought
2010-11-04T15:08:41  <janzert> ahh, ok
2010-11-04T15:08:51  <JamesMG> guess I need to get away from ReadLine
2010-11-04T15:08:59  <janzert> great yet another mono bug :}
2010-11-04T15:09:04  <JamesMG> yeah no kidding :(
2010-11-04T15:09:09  <lavalamp_> once you get a NaN it pollutes your entire chain of calculations...
2010-11-04T15:09:12  <janzert> might be useful to post it on the forums as well if you don't mind
2010-11-04T15:09:17  <JamesMG> sure thing
2010-11-04T15:10:00  <Zannick> doing any sort of arithmetic will get you one of three values: nan, +inf, -inf
2010-11-04T15:10:13  <Zannick> *any sort of arithmetic with nan
2010-11-04T15:10:17  <JamesMG> you want it in your announcement thread or should I put it in technical issues?
2010-11-04T15:10:42  <lavalamp_> there are actually different NaN values depending on what you did to get the NaN

2010-11-04T15:11:35  <demerzel_> why did it overflow
2010-11-04T15:11:41  <demerzel_> james
2010-11-04T15:11:50  <janzert> mono bug
2010-11-04T15:11:57  <JamesMG> ReadLine can't handle more than 1025 characters in Console apparently?
2010-11-04T15:12:00  <JamesMG> in mono.
2010-11-04T15:12:20  <Zannick> i guess they use a static buffer of 1024?
2010-11-04T15:12:33  <demerzel_> why would readline try to get that whole thing tho
2010-11-04T15:12:38  <JamesMG> beats me
2010-11-04T15:12:44  <JamesMG> because it's mono?  :)
2010-11-04T15:13:08  <raedwulf> its an old version  of mono too :p
2010-11-04T15:13:08  <demerzel_> lemme see what i was using
2010-11-04T15:13:20  <demerzel_> oh you can fix that
2010-11-04T15:14:01  <JamesMG> I'm just going to switch off of ReadLine, it's convenient but not necessary for this
2010-11-04T15:14:05  <demerzel_> i can't find my code
2010-11-04T15:14:14  <demerzel_> but basically just declare a binarystream with a buffer of say 4096
2010-11-04T15:14:20  <demerzel_> and then point console.in to it
2010-11-04T15:14:49  <demerzel_> try that and see if it still crashes
2010-11-04T15:14:57  <JamesMG> I'm amazed I haven't hit this problem before

2010-11-04T15:16:55  <demerzel_> maybe it overran the buffer looking for \r\n
2010-11-04T15:17:04  <demerzel_> if it's seriously 1024 tho that's a major issue

2010-11-04T15:30:16  <JamesMG> wrapping stdin with a bufferedstream seems to have fixed it
2010-11-04T15:30:24  <boegel> oh, wait
2010-11-04T15:30:29  <boegel> forget it

2010-11-04T15:30:42  <JamesMG> now I'm curious boegel
2010-11-04T15:30:46  <JamesMG> spill it :)
2010-11-04T15:31:06  <boegel> I was just joking :)
2010-11-04T15:35:49  <JamesMG> of course, I say it's working and now it legitimately times out
2010-11-04T15:36:42  <boegel> :)
2010-11-04T15:36:56  <boegel> I was just faking a feeling I've had for like a 1000 times
2010-11-04T15:37:10  <JamesMG> yeah I've done that a few times
2010-11-04T15:37:47  <Zannick> i've got a great idea for a bot
2010-11-04T15:37:57  <Zannick> however, it is not the type of bot that plays this game
2010-11-04T15:39:39  <demerzel_> JamesMG: if you set Console.In - make sure a) it's a static object whatever needs to can reach b) call NewStreamName.ReadLine() instead of Console.ReadLine()
2010-11-04T15:39:58  <demerzel_> b is optional but solves a lot of potential issues
2010-11-04T15:41:11  <JamesMG> Yeah I think I'm mangling scope of this thing somewhere
2010-11-04T15:41:23  <raedwulf> i've got brilliant ideas for my bot
2010-11-04T15:41:29  <raedwulf> but i actuallly have to get down to make it work
2010-11-04T15:41:31  <raedwulf> :/
2010-11-04T15:42:10  <JamesMG> or misusing BufferedStream, since it seems to like timing out after 10-15 turns
2010-11-04T15:43:57  <demerzel_> you have 2 steps to wrap it
2010-11-04T15:44:07  <demerzel_> if you just set Console.In to something then it waits for you to write to it
2010-11-04T15:44:30  <demerzel_> like my tcp injector sets console.in to a stringwriter and pumps to it then i can just console.readline in the main class w/o caring
2010-11-04T15:44:47  <demerzel_> if you want to wrap the whole thing you have to set the input to the stream also
2010-11-04T15:45:00  <demerzel_> eg BufferedStream blah = Console.GetInput()
2010-11-04T15:45:05  <demerzel_> then Console.In = blah
2010-11-04T15:45:09  <demerzel_> check syntax on google but that's essentially it
2010-11-04T15:46:40  <demerzel_> you could try this also - .NET 2.0 compliant, sets height and width for buffer (SetBufferSize might work also): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.setbuffersize%28v=VS.80%29.aspx
2010-11-04T15:46:49  <JamesMG> I've taken the BufferedStream out, it's just using a StreamReader now
2010-11-04T15:47:14  <JamesMG> new StreamReader(Console.GetInputStream()) and then Console.SetIn(that)
2010-11-04T15:48:27  <JamesMG> seems to accept the game state that crashed it before
2010-11-04T15:48:58  <demerzel_> oh sorry yea i meant bytestream not bufferedstream
2010-11-04T15:49:03  <demerzel_> iirc bufferedstream is java lol
2010-11-04T15:49:15  <demerzel_> streamreader works too
2010-11-04T15:49:18  <JamesMG> C# has one too apparently, but it crashes if you use it :)

2010-11-04T16:00:05  <raedwulf> woah it appears that that piece of code works
2010-11-04T16:00:27  <raedwulf> whether its correct, is a different matter
2010-11-04T16:01:30  <demerzel_> what piece of code
2010-11-04T16:01:44  <raedwulf> basically move selection
2010-11-04T16:01:59  <raedwulf> but it doesn't have any offensive code yet
2010-11-04T16:02:00  <demerzel_> nice
2010-11-04T16:02:05  <demerzel_> still working out defense bugs
2010-11-04T16:02:16  <demerzel_> at least it's tryign to defend itself just slightly off
2010-11-04T16:02:27  <raedwulf> yea but i need some offensive code to play, otherwise it'll never try and take an enemy planet :P

2010-11-04T16:27:16  <bhasker__> which it wasn't doing earlier
2010-11-04T16:27:33  <bhasker__> i really need to run more exhaustive tests
2010-11-04T16:27:50  <Error323> yeah, its a lot of waiting for results
2010-11-04T16:28:05  <Error323> currently @ 44 ranking :D
2010-11-04T16:28:08  <bhasker__> nice
2010-11-04T16:28:21  <Error323> but i do expect to get much higher though
2010-11-04T16:28:31  <Error323> however it takes loooooads of time -.-
2010-11-04T16:29:22  <JamesMG> not a very interesting game but the graph at the bottom is neat: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=856433

2010-11-04T16:29:48  <JamesMG> also my bot is obviously bugged some more
2010-11-04T16:32:08  <Error323> i have a new idea
2010-11-04T16:32:20  <Error323> its just that it'll take a massive amount of time to implement
2010-11-04T16:32:31  <AJC> Error323: the coding takes time, or the leveling up?
2010-11-04T16:32:42  <Error323> AJC: both :-)

2010-11-04T16:33:37  <AJC> this time, it's the last one...
2010-11-04T16:33:37  <AJC> hehe
2010-11-04T16:33:42  <Error323> haha
2010-11-04T16:33:58  <Error323> it gets worse once your work stats to pay off
2010-11-04T16:34:08  <Error323> then you _really_ want a good revisioning system
2010-11-04T16:34:20  <JamesMG> it's easier to put it down when you are making it worse, trust me I know

2010-11-04T16:36:02  <AJC> it's obtuse.
2010-11-04T16:36:05  <Error323> you are crazy

2010-11-04T16:36:24  <AJC> like doing stupid shit like paginating diffs by default
2010-11-04T16:36:25  <AJC> WTF?
2010-11-04T16:36:42  <Error323> it is the most awesome system for non-binary data in the world
2010-11-04T16:36:52  <Error323> paginating?

2010-11-04T16:37:55  <raedwulf> AJC: pipe it into a different pager
2010-11-04T16:38:00  <Error323> j&k
2010-11-04T16:38:06  <AJC> it does this by default.
2010-11-04T16:38:09  *** bhasker__ <bhasker__!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-wqvuuelkxauiaxam> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
2010-11-04T16:38:17  <raedwulf> it depends what pager you have setup as default
2010-11-04T16:38:18  <Error323> it has vim bindings for scrolling
2010-11-04T16:38:20  <demerzel_> amstan: good luck with that - it's a pretty standard list, it should qualify it with the url but i have no idea how you'd go about that
2010-11-04T16:38:21  <Zannick> haha svn, perforce
2010-11-04T16:38:22  <AJC> raedwulf: I don't want to page it, it's a non-unix like default behavior.
2010-11-04T16:38:34  <amstan> demerzel_: can you tell me which line was offensive?
2010-11-04T16:38:41  <AJC> I can type "| less" myself thanks.
2010-11-04T16:38:49  <demerzel_> amstan: you mean which line in http or which line in the list?
2010-11-04T16:38:53  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-04T16:38:57  <amstan> demerzel_: the list
2010-11-04T16:39:00  <demerzel_> yea one sec
2010-11-04T16:39:02  <amstan> demerzel_: https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-adblock.txt
2010-11-04T16:39:07  <amstan> that one?
2010-11-04T16:39:17  <Error323> well... as a terminal user i just open a second on my other screen
2010-11-04T16:39:29  <amstan> demerzel_: because i can't find "##.leaderboard" in it, only "##.leaderboard2"
2010-11-04T16:39:34  <Error323> and when i quit the diff, my normal terminal is back. imo its better
2010-11-04T16:39:47  <Error323> but i guess thats differs per person :P
2010-11-04T16:39:56  <raedwulf> yea i quite like vimpager :P
2010-11-04T16:40:24  <raedwulf> Zannick: yes its becoming more like vim vs non-vim atm tho
2010-11-04T16:40:26  <raedwulf> lol
2010-11-04T16:40:48  <Zannick> i mean
2010-11-04T16:40:54  <Zannick> *I* would rather use vim than svn
2010-11-04T16:40:56  <Error323> i just love the branching, cherry-picking and merging with blazing speed and very good algorithms
2010-11-04T16:41:05  <raedwulf> Zannick: i agree :P
2010-11-04T16:41:07  <demerzel_> amstan: 10173
2010-11-04T16:41:09  <Error323> qualitatively
2010-11-04T16:41:09  <Zannick> :P
2010-11-04T16:42:28  <demerzel_> amstan: you could just change the name to ranklist or ai-leaderboard that woudl be a much faster fix
2010-11-04T16:42:32  <demerzel_> classname that is
2010-11-04T16:42:43  <amstan> demerzel_: but then i have to get the svn and do all that
2010-11-04T16:42:50  <amstan> ugh... this is easier.. lol
2010-11-04T16:43:02  <AJC> Error323: git is a bit retarded at merging though, so far in my experience I had better luck with SVN 1.6 even.  it's not been horrible, just not as good as fanboi's claim :-)
2010-11-04T16:43:18  <raedwulf> :o
2010-11-04T16:43:21  <sigh> o_O
2010-11-04T16:43:21  <Error323> o_O
2010-11-04T16:43:48  <Zannick> hg merge is nice
2010-11-04T16:43:52  <amstan> AJC: ugh.. you're one of those guys... that hates |less automatically
2010-11-04T16:43:54  <AJC> Error323: but IMHO it's the commandline and feedback that are worst, it's simply not designed with users in mind.
2010-11-04T16:44:08  <Error323> hmmm
2010-11-04T16:44:32  <AJC> amstan: unix has a philosophy of combining tools together to create complex stuff, why go against that?  no other program does it, it's counter intuitive.
2010-11-04T16:44:41  <amstan> AJC: man
2010-11-04T16:44:58  <raedwulf> :o
2010-11-04T16:45:32  <Error323> AJC: http://www.newartisans.com/blog_assets/git.from.bottom.up.pdf I read this, and then I knew why it was so awesome, it really helps with your understanding of howto use it. Read it when you have time :)
2010-11-04T16:45:37  <amstan> i'm pretty sure the line of thought was ... most people want a pager for git log, so let's add it
2010-11-04T16:45:55  <lavalamp_> man always struck me as weird
2010-11-04T16:46:05  <AJC> amstan: hehe, like there are not enough pager implementations in the world.
2010-11-04T16:46:17  <raedwulf> you can select the pager implementation...
2010-11-04T16:46:18  <amstan> AJC: it's just using normal less, they didn't make their own
2010-11-04T16:46:18  <lavalamp_> but it makes sense in the days before scroll bar widgets
2010-11-04T16:46:19  <Zannick> i created an alias for hg log to use |less
2010-11-04T16:46:20  <raedwulf> :/
2010-11-04T16:46:30  <amstan> AJC: it's in the config files for git, you can change it to use cat instead
2010-11-04T16:46:44  <raedwulf> export PAGER=cat
2010-11-04T16:46:50  <raedwulf> or something should do the trick as well
2010-11-04T16:46:57  <raedwulf> i can't remember the env variable tho
2010-11-04T16:47:14  <Error323> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/286205/
2010-11-04T16:47:18  <raedwulf> yes its PAGER
2010-11-04T16:47:23  <Migi32> mega1, can I ask if your bot is deterministic or not?
2010-11-04T16:47:47  <Error323> you just kinda did :P
2010-11-04T16:48:16  <Migi32> no I asked if I could ask. If he says I can't ask I won't ask :P
2010-11-04T16:48:26  <amstan> there was a kernel mailing list discussion about this
2010-11-04T16:48:57  <lavalamp_> what you really want to know is will he answer, I don't think there's much question as to whether you're capable of forming the question
2010-11-04T16:49:34  <amstan> there we go: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2008/12/17/4443664

2010-11-04T17:42:21  <rabidus> in what client
2010-11-04T17:42:31  <Migi32> ah no it usually doesn't. Only when people respond.
2010-11-04T17:42:32  <lavalamp_> the web one
2010-11-04T17:42:52  <lavalamp_> hm well contestbot responded...
2010-11-04T17:42:57  <Migi32> not in a new window?
2010-11-04T17:43:17  <lavalamp_> nope
2010-11-04T17:43:40  <Zannick> i don't really know how the web one works
2010-11-04T17:43:45  <Migi32> strange, here neither, on XChat
2010-11-04T17:43:48  <lavalamp_> oh well
2010-11-04T17:44:04  <Zannick> but that might have done a notice instead of a query
2010-11-04T17:44:11  * Zannick shrug
2010-11-04T17:44:22  <amstan> yeah, changed all personal replies to queries
2010-11-04T17:44:53  <Zannick> oh yeah, i didn't even notice he was not using queries in my pm session
2010-11-04T17:46:35  <Zannick> some clients won't open a new window on /msg, but wait until they receive one back
2010-11-04T17:46:58  <Zannick> so if a notice is used instead, it is placed in the channel window
2010-11-04T17:47:06  <Zannick> that's what i expect you saw in the web client
2010-11-04T17:47:53  <lavalamp_> yeah I guess so
2010-11-04T17:48:11  <JamesMG> think I need to tell my bot to stop sniping planets clear across the map again
2010-11-04T17:48:54  <lavalamp_> I may have made my bot finally understand that some goals are worse than doing nothing, but it's too buggy to tell atm

2010-11-04T18:02:25  <Frontier> amstan: I have this doubt, that the maps will change all that much, but if there are new maps, I could still checksum them and add the information to the next upload

2010-11-04T18:03:04  <lavalamp_> I think we know that the finals will be run with different maps after submissions are over
2010-11-04T18:03:22  <amstan> so like.. it could be same sized maps, but different seeds
2010-11-04T18:03:56  <Error323> amstan: will the intermediate results be shown?
2010-11-04T18:03:58  <lavalamp_> amstan: if you guys are going to change the number of planets you really need to announce that... I'm not the only one depending on it...
2010-11-04T18:04:15  <Frontier> amstan: I have analyzed quite a few starting moves and it looks like I could get a slight advantage out of these precalculations. Remember these maps where the starting planets are really distant from each other? There is plenty of time for 'dump' replay of optimal moves.
2010-11-04T18:04:20  <amstan> lavalamp_: number of planets is variable, isn't it?
2010-11-04T18:04:26  <JamesMG> I'm depending on you increasing planets to 1000 so I can win

2010-11-04T18:09:54  <Frontier> amstan: At least it would be fair if we knew by now what that the game rules and planet distances/numbers/symmetry will stay the same. People who try to support any number of planets or asymetric maps will have a disatvantage, because they miss optimization opportunities.

2010-11-04T18:10:22  <Zannick> what is most likely to happen is the map generator will simply be run some more
2010-11-04T18:10:31  <demerzel_> yea i know what a mixed strategy is
2010-11-04T18:10:32  <Zannick> which will generate maps with the same conditions
2010-11-04T18:10:34  <lavalamp_> I'm counting on that
2010-11-04T18:10:42  <demerzel_> i am asking if you end up with 2 actions prob 75/25 do you always take 75
2010-11-04T18:10:49  <lavalamp_> demerzel_: choose randomly
2010-11-04T18:10:51  <amstan> Frontier: i told you, probably the seeds will change
2010-11-04T18:10:51  <Frontier> Zannick: I think most of us silently assume that ^^
2010-11-04T18:11:18  <lavalamp_> 75% of the time do the first one.
2010-11-04T18:11:32  <Zannick> Frontier: i think that answers your statement above, then
2010-11-04T18:11:33  <Frontier> amstan: So the map with ID 1 will have a different layout or do you mean, you create more maps 200...900?
2010-11-04T18:11:49  <Zannick> Frontier: the map number doesn't matter, you're not told it

2010-11-04T18:12:38  <JamesMG> just pick one to name that, will be accurate eventually
2010-11-04T18:12:49  <Frontier> Zannick: Ok, so will the seed change result in all my cached map data becoming invalid?
2010-11-04T18:12:50  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-04T18:12:59  <bhasker> 0.19 is doing quite well except for that single loss to shampoo
2010-11-04T18:13:10  <Zannick> Frontier: what are you caching on?
2010-11-04T18:13:22  <Zannick> if you're doing a straight hash of all the planet data, then i doubt it
2010-11-04T18:14:10  <Zannick> if are caching by id, and doing some sort of check, then also no
2010-11-04T18:14:31  <Zannick> because it doesn't matter how the server numbers planets, if you keep your own index
2010-11-04T18:14:51  <Frontier> Zannick: I am caching on initial moves, by hash over the map data.

2010-11-04T18:15:05  <lavalamp_> I imagine if they generate new maps with a different seed they will be completely different maps
2010-11-04T18:15:11  <Zannick> so yes, hashing the map data won't change
2010-11-04T18:15:24  <Zannick> if you get a different map you simply won't find it in your cache
2010-11-04T18:15:38  <Zannick> unless you get really unlucky and there's a hash collision
2010-11-04T18:15:43  <lavalamp_> ...if not then something is wrong with the rng
2010-11-04T18:15:51  <Frontier> ...and what I'm trying to tell is how useful that caching would be if there are new maps after the deadline.

2010-11-04T18:16:13  <Frontier> Will all maps be replaced? If yes, I can dump that idea.
2010-11-04T18:16:16  <Zannick> if there are only new maps, not useful
2010-11-04T18:16:22  <Zannick> if both, partially useful
2010-11-04T18:16:31  <Frontier> Zannick: thx for stating the obvious ^^
2010-11-04T18:16:42  <Zannick> you won't be able to update the cache afterwards...

2010-11-04T18:17:27  <Frontier> but my code sometimes takes 30 minutes and 2GB of ram to calculate the initial moves :(

2010-11-04T19:18:23  <bhasker> true
2010-11-04T19:18:35  <bhasker> so you submitting a new version sigh?
2010-11-04T19:19:04  <Migi32> I've developed an algorithm that can identify very good attack plans really well, but the problem is that I can only evaluate about 4000 positions per second...
2010-11-04T19:19:10  <sigh> I dunno... I haven't got anything significantly different
2010-11-04T19:19:18  <Migi32> what do you guys use to generate moves?
2010-11-04T19:19:30  <Migi32> (if it's any different from evaluating the moves)
2010-11-04T19:19:46  <bhasker> mine is a heuristic bot
2010-11-04T19:19:53  <bhasker> so its like take planet A
2010-11-04T19:19:56  <bhasker> can i acquire it
2010-11-04T19:19:58  <sigh> Migi32: I just decide the best way to attack destinations independantly, then combine the plans
2010-11-04T19:19:58  <bhasker> launch
2010-11-04T19:20:01  <bhasker> rinse repeat
2010-11-04T19:20:13  <bhasker> thats about how complicated the logic is
2010-11-04T19:20:24  <sigh> "best way" is a very crude approximation :P
2010-11-04T19:20:34  <Migi32> hmm... Problem is that this evaluator is kinda like a back box. Put in a position, get back a number.
2010-11-04T19:20:36  <bhasker> the real complication is in figuring out how many ships i can send and how many i need ot send to capture

2010-11-04T19:39:48  <antimatroid1> sure he doesn't just very rarely lose, and there's more new maps than old maps?
2010-11-04T19:40:19  <antimatroid1> i don't think he's relying on "knowing" the map previously
2010-11-04T19:40:42  <Frontier> antimatroid: You can calculate some best moves for the start of the round to maximise ships or growth. Maybe something like that helps him do things in under 1 second that would require hours to be done on the fly.
2010-11-04T19:41:18  <antimatroid1> he also has to match the map to one, the bot doens't get id on starting
2010-11-04T19:41:21  <antimatroid1> that'd be costly

2010-11-04T19:43:25  <demerzel_> that's really all you'd need
2010-11-04T19:43:34  <Frontier> antimatroid1: a hash of the map isn't THAT costly as a lookup for a table of 100 ids
2010-11-04T19:43:36  <demerzel_> i have all the maps in a sql db that i haven't used haha
2010-11-04T19:44:10  <demerzel_> i did have the top 100 matches but pre-mega1 so pretty worthless now and i don't wanna clean it up
2010-11-04T19:44:58  <Frontier> so you could select all matches of bot A on map B for example?
2010-11-04T19:45:04  <demerzel_> yea
2010-11-04T19:45:24  <demerzel_> i still have the web extractor i might use it if i start feeling desperate in a couple weeks
2010-11-04T19:45:31  <demerzel_> what i lack in creativity i can query the hell out of lol
2010-11-04T19:46:02  <demerzel_> my initial thought was to track initial selections
2010-11-04T19:46:16  <demerzel_> but that is insanely hard now because there are so many variables plus mixed strategies seem to be the norm
2010-11-04T19:46:38  <Frontier> antimatroid1: well, bocsimacko hasn't lost a single game on a map with an id <= 100. But the low ids are really rare after all so you might be right

2010-11-04T19:48:16  <Frontier> I guess the admin wouldn't be so happy if 3000 people loaded all the games through http-requests.
2010-11-04T19:49:13  <sigh> Frontier: <j3camero> We need somebody to write a genetic algorithm that auto-submits bots once every hour to test different parameters. That would be ballin.
2010-11-04T19:49:14  <sigh> :P
2010-11-04T19:49:34  <Zannick> don't really need to submit with the tcp server
2010-11-04T19:49:48  <Zannick> also, submitting to the main server doesn't get you as many games
2010-11-04T19:49:56  <Frontier> hehe. when amstan sais he might change the random seed for the maps... what does that mean? is the random seed the map id?
2010-11-04T19:49:59  <sigh> ah, you were talking about something ekse
2010-11-04T19:50:15  <Zannick> Frontier: the seed for the random number generator
2010-11-04T19:50:29  <Frontier> ...and also the map id ???
2010-11-04T19:50:33  <Zannick> no

2010-11-04T19:51:14  <sigh> Frontier: are you trying to predict the random seed? :P
2010-11-04T19:51:24  <Zannick> the seeds for the current maps have not been saved
2010-11-04T19:51:45  <Zannick> the map generator doesn't even have a place to input it, though you can hack around it by importing random first and seeding from there
2010-11-04T19:52:00  <Frontier> ok, that was the missing information. so currently the seed is fed by system time or something and the map id just increments
2010-11-04T19:52:25  <Zannick> yeah, seeded by whatever the default it
2010-11-04T19:52:29  <Zannick> s/it/is/
2010-11-04T19:52:56  <antimatroid1> do we know who testingFromPiter is on official server?
2010-11-04T19:53:05  <antimatroid1> i wonder how many decent bots will be put up right at the end
2010-11-04T19:53:24  <antimatroid1> mine was a top 10 worthy bot last time that we didn't get ready till like a week or two before the final tourny
2010-11-04T19:54:24  <demerzel_> the bar has been rising pretty rapidly
2010-11-04T19:54:31  <demerzel_> i'd be surprised if a total unknown swept in at the last second
2010-11-04T19:54:49  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't

2010-11-04T19:56:15  <antimatroid1> it was easier for tron i'll admit that much, but i don't think it's undoable
2010-11-04T19:56:24  <antimatroid1> one can watch other peoples games
2010-11-04T19:56:30  <sigh> unless they just read all the channel logs and study the top games intensively :P
2010-11-04T19:57:24  <demerzel_> you don't think the people in this chan do that?
2010-11-04T19:57:24  <antimatroid1> i expect there's at least a few people with half decent bots that aren't openly testing them
2010-11-04T19:57:28  <antimatroid1> no
2010-11-04T19:57:38  <demerzel_> lol i do :P
2010-11-04T19:57:39  <antimatroid1> most of the people on here are always talking about their bots on tcp
2010-11-04T19:57:52  <demerzel_> altho i don't study top games
2010-11-04T19:57:56  <sigh> there are a lot of lurkers here

2010-11-04T19:58:06  <demerzel_> i feel like i have a pretty good feel for when a strat is good by now just watching viz

2010-11-04T19:58:30  <antimatroid1> pretty much all of my ideas are available in chan logs, but i don't think it matters much about knowing ones idea for this
2010-11-04T19:58:36  <antimatroid1> the implementation is so crtitical
2010-11-04T19:58:40  <demerzel_> ^^
2010-11-04T19:58:48  <demerzel_> and fun!
2010-11-04T19:59:07  <demerzel_> i looked at this like a coding challenge but now it's an intellectual one haha
2010-11-04T19:59:09  <Cyndre> lmao
2010-11-04T19:59:19  <sigh> yeah, personally I enjoy this competition more for the exhange of ideas than anything else
2010-11-04T19:59:22  <sigh> *exchange
2010-11-04T19:59:25  <Cyndre> I havent touched it in a month
2010-11-04T19:59:29  <antimatroid1> coding challenges should be intellectual ones :P
2010-11-04T19:59:57  <sigh> I'm not taking the competition too seriously now
2010-11-04T20:00:03  <demerzel_> ok stallman
2010-11-04T20:00:12  <demerzel_> i'm gonna put the gnu license on my source after competition

2010-11-04T20:01:06  <antimatroid1> but for such short competitions, you can't really do much else
2010-11-04T20:01:18  <sigh> Cyndre: hack server and steal bocksimacko's code
2010-11-04T20:01:40  <antimatroid1> i think minimax will win again

2010-11-04T20:01:59  <sigh> but their problems get a bit repetitive

2010-11-04T20:36:14  <hambone> I used the
2010-11-04T20:36:16  <hambone> web client
2010-11-04T20:36:29  <hambone> can i use it to irc somewhere else
2010-11-04T20:36:37  <demerzel_> haha google mirc
2010-11-04T20:36:40  <demerzel_> i'm sure you can
2010-11-04T20:37:08  <demerzel_> i use it cuz it's more convenient to leave a tab open in ff than have another window open
2010-11-04T20:37:21  <hambone> is there any standard
2010-11-04T20:37:22  <hambone> thing
2010-11-04T20:37:35  <hambone> in unix or whatever for irc
2010-11-04T20:37:37  <demerzel_> mirc is pretty much universal
2010-11-04T20:37:44  <demerzel_> oh idk about unix i know there is probably many
2010-11-04T20:37:48  <hambone> i cannot download
2010-11-04T20:38:00  <hambone> what might i expect to be installed

2010-11-04T20:38:34  <demerzel_> probably something builtin
2010-11-04T20:38:38  <demerzel_> even

2010-11-04T22:44:57  <antimatroid1> i wish there was notation to say a sequence is in a set
2010-11-04T22:45:02  <antimatroid1> like subset and element of
2010-11-04T22:45:05  <antimatroid1> sequence of
2010-11-04T22:45:27  <j3camero> There is in Python hehe
2010-11-04T22:45:47  <j3camero> Python > math
2010-11-04T22:45:52  <j3camero> :-P
2010-11-04T22:47:06  <antimatroid1> what notation does python use for that?
2010-11-04T22:47:13  <antimatroid1> perhaps i shall just adopt it
2010-11-04T22:53:01  <demerzel_> python doesn't use "notation"
2010-11-04T22:53:13  <demerzel_> it's beyond it
2010-11-04T22:53:33  <antimatroid1> i've come to love simple notation
2010-11-04T22:53:45  <antimatroid1> the more i can say with less, the better
2010-11-04T22:55:34  <demerzel_> in time we will realize that 'strong typing' is just a leftover from our ape brains
2010-11-04T22:56:19  <antimatroid1> what's "strong typing"?
2010-11-04T22:56:29  <sigh> strong typing is such an ambiguous term
2010-11-04T22:56:39  <sigh> it means different things to everyone
2010-11-04T22:56:57  <antimatroid1> what are some of the common things?
2010-11-04T22:57:28  <sigh> I think demerzel_ is using it as a synonym for static typing
2010-11-04T22:57:41  <antimatroid1> lol, what's that? :P
2010-11-04T22:57:58  <j3camero> I shall stay out of this debate. Anybody who brings up strong typing obviously has an extreme opinion on the subject. They're usually from Haskell-land, where the trolls lurk.
2010-11-04T22:58:01  <sigh> static typing is where the variables have a defined type at compile tie
2010-11-04T22:58:13  <antimatroid1> i plan to learn haskell at some point
2010-11-04T22:58:15  <sigh> *time
2010-11-04T22:58:33  <antimatroid1> oh yeah, i do often wish c++ wasn't like that
2010-11-04T22:59:00  <demerzel_> c++ has shitty runtime type stuff too it's not neatly packaged like reflection but it's mashed onto c
2010-11-04T22:59:03  <demerzel_> like most of the other stuff ;)
2010-11-04T23:00:04  <sigh> wikipedia: In computer science and computer programming, a type system is said to feature strong typing when it specifies one or more restrictions on how operations involving values of different data types can be intermixed.
2010-11-04T23:00:26  <demerzel_> i'm just messin with ya i don't care really
2010-11-04T23:00:29  <sigh> so you can see how people have different "interpretations"
2010-11-04T23:00:33  <demerzel_> but an 'easy' dev language to me is a trap
2010-11-04T23:01:01  <antimatroid1> yeah fair enough
2010-11-04T23:02:44  <sigh> demerzel_: 'easy' dev language?
2010-11-04T23:02:53  <demerzel_> python is marketed as that
2010-11-04T23:03:02  <demerzel_> implicit typing, foreach everything
2010-11-04T23:03:41  <sigh> fair enough
2010-11-04T23:05:33  <sigh> foreach everything is really, really nice though... I can't see any disadvantage there :)
2010-11-04T23:06:49  <antimatroid1> what i really want is a keyboard with all the greek letters and maths symbols accesible with a key like shift
2010-11-04T23:07:08  <antimatroid1> are those characters usable in source code?
2010-11-04T23:07:15  <sigh> antimatroid1: look up APL
2010-11-04T23:08:17  <sigh> haha... the wikipedia page has an example of an APL keyboard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)
2010-11-04T23:09:04  <sigh> it also wins the award for the most imaginative name ever
2010-11-04T23:09:06  <antimatroid1> seems kind of cool

2010-11-04T23:09:51  <antimatroid1> python and haskell are my biggest priorities when i can find time
2010-11-04T23:09:59  <sigh> dunno, if you are interested in APL but want normal characters then try J
2010-11-04T23:10:23  <antimatroid1> nah, performance wise?
2010-11-04T23:10:33  <sigh> dunno
2010-11-04T23:10:40  <antimatroid1> most of my porgramming is just doing stuff like project euler problems, or my own little things
2010-11-04T23:10:51  <antimatroid1> memory is my biggest bottleneck (probably the same for everyone)

2010-11-04T23:12:25  <sigh> antimatroid1: I did a vast majority of euler problems in python
2010-11-04T23:12:34  <antimatroid1> i've done all mine in c++ :P
2010-11-04T23:12:44  <sigh> performance wasn't too much of an issue except for a few problems
2010-11-04T23:12:59  <antimatroid1> i don't understand why i can't just guy a keyboard with all the greek symbols on it, surely it wouldn't be that hard for some chinese manufacturer to make them and sell them
2010-11-04T23:13:07  <antimatroid1> buy**
2010-11-04T23:13:27  <antimatroid1> are they all part of unicode or whatever it is?

2010-11-04T23:13:47  <antimatroid1> (and my englishy abilities)
2010-11-04T23:14:00  <sigh> my knowledge is enough to stay the fuck away from unicode whenever possible

2010-11-04T23:15:17  <sigh> also, if you are running into memory bottlenecks in c++ on project euler then you need to improve your algorithms
2010-11-04T23:15:19  <Frontier> sigh: You should work with Java, where Unicode is the base character representation.

2010-11-04T23:19:41  <sigh> :P
2010-11-04T23:21:03  <Frontier> So... I'm still trying to speed up my code that simulates every possible move. Somehow this 22*21*20*... stuff doesn't really want to run in under a second for even a small number of turns

2010-11-04T23:32:08  <Frontier> lol, I hope if I add more and more heuristics to my supposedly "exhaustive" search, it doesn't become all heuristical in the end. 1 second is a short time frame after all.
2010-11-04T23:32:11  <demerzel_> err trillion even
2010-11-04T23:32:17  <demerzel_> isn't that 21!
2010-11-04T23:32:25  <demerzel_> why did this window stop autoscrolling >:(
2010-11-04T23:32:30  <sigh> 22! = 51090942 trillion
2010-11-04T23:33:18  <sigh> lesson for today: factorial grows fast!
2010-11-04T23:33:38  <demerzel_> haha
2010-11-04T23:33:58  <demerzel_> do you actually gain anything by bitmasking in c
2010-11-04T23:34:38  <demerzel_> i haven't ever bothered with it becaues my day job is C# and i've never had a calc crunch like that before
2010-11-04T23:34:40  <Frontier> you can reduce the amount with an algorithm i invented yesterday: you pair your moves and use the best combination in the set. If you look at planet 3,4,5 you get 6 possible orders. Then you calculate which one is best and only keep that when you add your fourth planet.
2010-11-04T23:34:51  <demerzel_> in c that is since C# probably would make a bitmask slower lol
2010-11-04T23:34:55  <Frontier> It will break down the complexity to 2^n
2010-11-04T23:35:16  <sigh> exponential grows fast too, but not as bad a factorial :)
2010-11-04T23:35:20  <demerzel_> so what do you reduce 21! to
2010-11-04T23:35:28  <Frontier> 4.000.000
2010-11-04T23:35:32  <demerzel_> oh wow that's nice
2010-11-04T23:35:57  <demerzel_> isn't that just a/b
2010-11-04T23:36:00  <amstan> hey guys, i have an algorithms question that i can't figure out
2010-11-04T23:36:02  <amstan> i have a 2d array of heights
2010-11-04T23:36:03  <amstan> neighboring heights must respect the following heightA/8=heightB/8
2010-11-04T23:36:05  <amstan> exception happens only when abs(heightA/8-heightB/8)=1 and either of them %8=0
2010-11-04T23:36:06  <amstan> i need to change that array somehow, so it respects the rules mentioned
2010-11-04T23:36:38  <sigh> heightA/8=heightB/8  =>  heightA=heightB ?
2010-11-04T23:37:31  <Frontier> there is only one problem: if you cannot find a 'best' solution between (1->2->3, 2->3->1 and 1->3->2) you would have to keep them all and gradually get back to 22!. For example one solution gives you 200 ships and 20 growth while another gives you 100 ships and 15 growth.
2010-11-04T23:37:32  <amstan> sigh: integer division
2010-11-04T23:37:39  <sigh> ahhh
2010-11-04T23:37:57  <Frontier> *err 100 ships and 25 growth
2010-11-04T23:38:28  <demerzel_> sounds like you're way ahead of me on the brute force path lol

2010-11-04T23:39:44  <amstan> sigh: no they don't
2010-11-04T23:39:58  <amstan> one can be 0 the next one 8, the next one 16

2010-11-04T23:40:29  <amstan> Frontier: no
2010-11-04T23:41:16  <amstan> here's a valid one: 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,16,17,18
2010-11-04T23:41:30  <amstan> this is invalid: 1,2,3,9,10
2010-11-04T23:41:49  <amstan> since 3/8=0, 9/8=1 and neither of them are 8
2010-11-04T23:42:20  <amstan> now.. the check is easy to implement, using my rules
2010-11-04T23:42:32  <amstan> but i need to modify an array that i have to respect those rules
2010-11-04T23:42:44  <sigh> amstan: it really depends on what you want the result to be... I'd start from one square and propogate out
2010-11-04T23:42:45  <amstan> i can modify it as long as it kinda looks the same
2010-11-04T23:43:20  <sigh> amstan: but if you do that, the result might be completely different
2010-11-04T23:43:47  <demerzel_> oh good i don't need to learn c bitmasking: First rule of bit masks: Don't. Don't unless you have a really bad need to save a tiny amount of memory, and slowing down your code a lot isn't a problem
2010-11-04T23:44:15  <McLeopold> I'd find the 8's first.  Those are your magical "bridge" numbers.

2010-11-04T23:49:24  <sigh> amstan: what goes wrong if you fix a single square and propagate the constraints in a breath-first manner?
2010-11-04T23:49:32  <sigh> in the 2d case
2010-11-04T23:49:43  <sigh> *breadth-first
2010-11-04T23:49:43  <McLeopold> do diagonals count?
2010-11-04T23:49:49  <amstan> yes
2010-11-04T23:50:36  <McLeopold> so you're trying to find a good way to make a boxy looking terrain?
2010-11-04T23:50:46  <amstan> here's a screenshot showing this: http://pastebin.com/VWGqTgH3
2010-11-04T23:51:06  <amstan> each of those cubes can be divided in 8
2010-11-04T23:51:20  <amstan> the heights of each of the corners cannot pass through the cube boundaries
2010-11-04T23:51:39  <McLeopold> should I see a picture?
2010-11-04T23:51:47  <amstan> wait..
2010-11-04T23:51:48  <sigh> amstan: that's pastebin
2010-11-04T23:51:49  <amstan> darn
2010-11-04T23:51:51  <amstan> http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/upload/screenshot_130824.png
2010-11-04T23:51:53  <amstan> yeah
2010-11-04T23:51:54  <amstan> sorry
2010-11-04T23:52:01  <Frontier> will it look like minecraft?
2010-11-04T23:52:09  <amstan> Frontier: ideally it shouldn't
2010-11-04T23:52:28  <demerzel_> haha minecraft
2010-11-04T23:52:35  <demerzel_> i still have a server running on a vps
2010-11-04T23:52:42  <demerzel_> been waiting for like 2 months for an update
2010-11-04T23:53:54  <demerzel_> gnite good luck with your raster
2010-11-04T23:54:01  *** demerzel_ <demerzel_!488039c1@gateway/web/freenode/ip.72.128.57.193> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2010-11-04T23:56:01  <McLeopold> amstan: the more numbers divisible by 8 that exist, the easier it will be?
2010-11-04T23:56:29  <amstan> i guess so, but then it'll look blocky
2010-11-04T23:56:39  <amstan> with 45deg angles everywhere
2010-11-04T23:56:53  <McLeopold> so, for a start, round everything down to an number divisible by 8?
2010-11-04T23:56:56  <sigh> ah, interpolated minecraft :P
2010-11-04T23:57:02  <McLeopold> we can improve upon that start
2010-11-04T23:58:17  <amstan> McLeopold: ok.., then what?
2010-11-04T23:58:45  <McLeopold> in the picture, when you have some of those stair steps, you want to bump up the lower part so it is smooth?
2010-11-04T23:59:17  <amstan> McLeopold: pretty much
2010-11-04T23:59:46  <amstan> McLeopold: that error there looks like a 6,9
