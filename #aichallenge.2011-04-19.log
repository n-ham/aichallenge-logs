2011-04-19T00:02:43  <jaycobcoleman> You disappoint me painfully slow internet. I give up.
2011-04-19T00:08:40  <jaycobcoleman> I bet I can beat you in a slowest internet competition
2011-04-19T00:09:29  <jaycobcoleman> Check out these numbas: http://www.speedtest.net/result/1258725911.png
2011-04-19T00:10:55  <jaycobcoleman> We just upgraded. 500 kb/s just wasn't enough anymore. Also that's evidently not a plan anymore.
2011-04-19T00:11:19  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: i could probably do worse over serial cable
2011-04-19T00:11:30  <amstan> i once connected a p2 laptop to the internets that way
2011-04-19T00:13:05  <jaycobcoleman> I once tried play Black Ops using my cell phone service. Terrible experience
2011-04-19T00:18:00  <jaycobcoleman> Where's sigh to brag about google's ridiculously fast internet?
2011-04-19T00:26:27  <amstan> i lost my screenshot of my speed test
2011-04-19T00:28:37  <jaycobcoleman> is the 'owner' value that follows "a row col" going to be a character or integer value?
2011-04-19T00:31:21  <jaycobcoleman> I'm thinking integer. I'll just go with that.
2011-04-19T00:31:22  <janzert> woot, portal 2 is out
2011-04-19T00:31:40  <janzert> jaycobcoleman: I think it's a character but I'm not sure
2011-04-19T00:32:25  <jaycobcoleman> I'll play it later this week :)
2011-04-19T00:33:08  <jaycobcoleman> but I'm not sure about the character thing. I should think it would be consistent and the owner value for your own ants is 0
2011-04-19T00:36:43  <janzert> ok, I'm really not sure. it should be easy enough to check by running the engine though

2011-04-19T05:04:42  <janzert> it's the defines the distance at which food will become an ant
2011-04-19T05:05:25  <jaycobcoleman> but the ant will necessarily spawn on the location of the food?
2011-04-19T05:05:33  <sigh> yes
2011-04-19T05:06:03  <janzert> right, when a current ant gets within that distance
2011-04-19T05:06:05  <jaycobcoleman> phwew. Good.
2011-04-19T05:14:04  <antimatroid> note that it is the actual radius squared

2011-04-19T05:32:18  <Stocha> Writting stuff for helping people improve the starter bot ?
2011-04-19T05:32:30  <Stocha> Mmgn.
2011-04-19T05:32:38  <Stocha> i'm not sure i understand the challenge :p
2011-04-19T05:32:57  <Stocha> I could explain step by step how to build my ref bot.
2011-04-19T05:33:09  <Stocha> but that seems a bit overdoing it.
2011-04-19T05:33:21  <Stocha> Most people will use A* it seems. And i don't.
2011-04-19T05:33:36  <antimatroid> i'm not convinced on a*
2011-04-19T05:33:40  <antimatroid> not for this
2011-04-19T05:33:42  <Stocha> So the basic step for improving the bot seems to be : do nothing
2011-04-19T05:33:53  <Stocha> then : go for food with A* somehow
2011-04-19T05:34:20  <Stocha> and then : send at most one ant to any food, starting with the closest ant, to the closest food.
2011-04-19T05:34:34  <Stocha> beside that i wouldn't have much to say about making stronger bots.
2011-04-19T05:34:58  <Stocha> well, none of my ideas past my refbot worked so far.
2011-04-19T05:35:48  <Stocha> it always degrades the strength with Damage rule one. Well, they don't try to fight , so maybe my tests are not the good tests. But still, i don't see anything to say past basic greedy food eating.
2011-04-19T05:36:21  <Stocha> So i'm not sure i'm the right person to tell people how they should improve the starter bots.
2011-04-19T05:36:27  <sigh> Stocha: off topic, did you see the Go bot vs pro games last week?
2011-04-19T05:36:36  <Stocha> no ?
2011-04-19T05:36:39  <Stocha> how did it go ?
2011-04-19T05:36:49  <Stocha> what go bot was playing ? 19x19 ?
2011-04-19T05:37:02  <sigh> 9x9 and 19x19 handicap games
2011-04-19T05:37:18  <Stocha> did the 9x9 go well for the bot ?
2011-04-19T05:37:33  <Stocha> give me a link i guess :p
2011-04-19T05:37:50  <janzert> pachi won a 7 stone handicap game against a 9p
2011-04-19T05:38:02  <Stocha> impressive.
2011-04-19T05:38:09  <sigh> yeah, that game was awesome
2011-04-19T05:38:18  <sigh> chased and killed a large group
2011-04-19T05:38:25  <Stocha> what was the pro comment ? was he used to bot play ?
2011-04-19T05:38:44  <sigh> my understanding was that the pros were familiar with how bots play
2011-04-19T05:38:55  <Stocha> I haven't check bot progress for a long time. It's quite stuck for some years now :p
2011-04-19T05:39:12  <sigh> I'm trying to find the link for the tourney
2011-04-19T05:39:16  <Stocha> okay
2011-04-19T05:39:55  <janzert> its been making great progress the last few years, just that it has been more incremental so easier to overlook :)
2011-04-19T05:40:08  <Stocha> did it ?
2011-04-19T05:40:21  <Stocha> i totally overlooked it. there was very few article that i saw.
2011-04-19T05:40:32  <janzert> yeah, from my perspective at least it's been pretty steady progress
2011-04-19T05:40:33  <Stocha> Beside the early mogo and crazystone.
2011-04-19T05:41:06  <janzert> erica, zen, pachi seem to be the current generation of top contenders
2011-04-19T05:41:40  <Stocha> zen is totaly private as far as i know. I could even not use montecarlo, i wouldn't be able to know it for sure :p
2011-04-19T05:41:45  <Stocha> it
2011-04-19T05:41:47  <sigh> pachi is open source, I think
2011-04-19T05:41:55  <janzert> yes pachi is open
2011-04-19T05:42:09  <janzert> zen is using mcts, I've seen that much on the computer-go list
2011-04-19T05:42:12  <Stocha> what is built in that make a difference with early crazystone/mogo ?
2011-04-19T05:42:22  <Stocha> in pachi i mean.
2011-04-19T05:42:31  <sigh> for one it's a lot better at handicap games
2011-04-19T05:42:39  <Stocha> yeah. why ?
2011-04-19T05:42:41  <sigh> due to dynamic komi, i think
2011-04-19T05:43:03  <sigh> e.g. in the 7H games it imposes a large komi on itself to be more aggressive
2011-04-19T05:43:11  <Stocha> that's quite an old idea. I didn't knew it was successful
2011-04-19T05:43:18  <sigh> and linearly scales it down during the game

2011-04-19T05:43:30  <sigh> yeah, otherwise the bots jus think they are winning and play like crap
2011-04-19T05:43:38  <janzert> yeah, dynamic komi seems to be one of the small improvements that several groups have gotten to actually work recently
2011-04-19T05:43:43  <Stocha> it's hard to tell what "crap" is.
2011-04-19T05:44:19  <sigh> Stocha: and sometimes it is quite easy
2011-04-19T05:44:28  <Stocha> But if dynamic komi works, that then says that without it moves were objectivilly crap, after all :p
2011-04-19T05:44:49  <antimatroid> janzert: have you been making anything lately?
2011-04-19T05:44:57  <Stocha> Well, a lot of good player see the bot and say they play crap. but it's beyond me.
2011-04-19T05:44:57  <antimatroid> including working on your arimaa bot
2011-04-19T05:45:13  <janzert> antimatroid: for the contest? or something else?
2011-04-19T05:45:21  <antimatroid> anything cool
2011-04-19T05:45:27  <antimatroid> since people are talking about cool stuff
2011-04-19T05:45:28  <sigh> Stocha: it's more obvious when you look at bots playing endgame... you really see them play a good endgame
2011-04-19T05:45:49  <Stocha> how do you define "good endgame" ?
2011-04-19T05:45:53  <sigh> either they are ahead, and they play crap because they can get away with it... other they are behind and have resigned already or are playing desperate moves
2011-04-19T05:45:56  <janzert> nothing cool :( just checked in some more work on the contest setup scripts that kept me occupied the last few days
2011-04-19T05:45:57  <antimatroid> near optimal play
2011-04-19T05:46:00  <Stocha> mogo was notoriously strong at end game.
2011-04-19T05:46:05  <antimatroid> :P
2011-04-19T05:46:13  <Stocha> optimal in the sense of the game that try to maximize score ?
2011-04-19T05:46:21  <sigh> Stocha: they are good at endgame, except you rarely see them exhibit it
2011-04-19T05:46:38  <sigh> yes, optimal in the sense of maximising score
2011-04-19T05:47:04  <sigh> bots don't care about maximising score, only about winning
2011-04-19T05:47:05  <Stocha> (score being stone / eyes count at the end of the game. Not percent of winning or anything alike :p )
2011-04-19T05:47:20  <antimatroid> sigh: depends on how the bot is written :P
2011-04-19T05:47:34  <sigh> antimatroid: sure, I'm talking about the current implementations
2011-04-19T05:47:35  <Stocha> If the game goal is winning. Then carying about winning makes sense.
2011-04-19T05:47:59  <sigh> Stocha: not disputing that... I'm not saying that the bots should play differently... just stating a fact
2011-04-19T05:48:39  <sigh> bots do play a very strong endgame, it's just not optimal in terms of maximising score so some of the moves look like 30k moves
2011-04-19T05:48:51  <sigh> unless the game is really close
2011-04-19T05:48:53  <Stocha> yeah, the fact is the bot play crap with handicap game i guess.
2011-04-19T05:49:06  <sigh> yes, and dynamic komi is an attempt to fix that
2011-04-19T05:49:13  <sigh> and it seems to work quite well
2011-04-19T05:49:18  <Stocha> I think they also have trouble with seki. Maybe even in the endgame. Although it might have changed.
2011-04-19T05:49:42  <Stocha> I think there was a problem with Seki+ko also.
2011-04-19T05:49:51  <sigh> before the pros pachi was being tuned against some of the high dans, and 7-8d were having trouble beating it on 6 stones
2011-04-19T05:50:12  <Stocha> yeah.
2011-04-19T05:50:15  <sigh> like, pachi won more often than not
2011-04-19T05:50:19  <Stocha> that make it 1d. not very impressive.
2011-04-19T05:50:27  <sigh> pachi is 3d on KGS
2011-04-19T05:50:33  <Stocha> comparing to early crazystone i mean.
2011-04-19T05:51:15  <Stocha> That doesn't sound like a revolution. More like they are trying to work around some weakness by heavy engineering. i doubt that will lead past 6d
2011-04-19T05:51:41  <sigh> the difference between dan ranks is huge in terms of the effort required
2011-04-19T05:52:01  <Stocha> i think early montecarlo /winning crazy stone went beyond dan rank. some years back on kgs.
2011-04-19T05:52:16  <Stocha> sigh : ?
2011-04-19T05:52:21  <Stocha> what do you mean ?
2011-04-19T05:52:49  <Stocha> i have been told by some that they had found a problem at 4k, but that 1d and 3d felt the same to them.
2011-04-19T05:53:06  <sigh> i mean that to improve a single rank at dan level is difficult and gets progressively harder
2011-04-19T05:53:09  <Stocha> Well someone told me also that 4k and 1d felt the same to him.
2011-04-19T05:53:27  <Stocha> it certainly get hard when you go past 5d on aga.
2011-04-19T05:53:29  <sigh> definelty disagree on the 4k-1d comment
2011-04-19T05:53:39  <sigh> but your first point does depends on the person
2011-04-19T05:54:12  <Naktibalda> it's certainly are the same if a person is DDK
2011-04-19T05:54:13  <Stocha> The thing is, a was 4k and sundenly became 1d. And had no idea what changed in his playing :p
2011-04-19T05:54:15  <sigh> I shouldn't single out dan ranks... at any rank it gets progressivly harder to improve as you get stronger
2011-04-19T05:54:41  <Stocha> Past 5d with  aga, you begin to work the asymptotic behavior of the ranking :p
2011-04-19T05:54:45  <sigh> Stocha: ah, that can happen when you overcome some sort of roadblock in your play :)
2011-04-19T05:54:47  <Stocha> maybe it's not aga
2011-04-19T05:54:55  <Stocha> i mean the system that is used in france.
2011-04-19T05:55:14  <Stocha> sigh: yeah but why don't the person realize that he did ?
2011-04-19T05:55:29  <Naktibalda> so 4k and 1d in different systems?
2011-04-19T05:55:39  <sigh> Stocha: because a lot of go is intuitive
2011-04-19T05:55:50  <Stocha> i have some evidence that my own level can go from 4k to 1d and back to 4k.
2011-04-19T05:55:57  <sigh> Naktibalda: it can be, but I hope we are under the assumption that we are looking at the same system
2011-04-19T05:56:53  <Stocha> human doesn't fit well to ranking systems :p
2011-04-19T05:56:55  <sigh> Stocha: maybe you are right... but from my perspective I can definitely say 1d are harder to beat
2011-04-19T05:57:03  <Stocha> they never play the same conditions. you can't set their seed or anything.
2011-04-19T05:57:07  <Naktibalda> 4k has a very low chance to beat 1d
2011-04-19T05:57:10  <Stocha> you can't make play a 100 games to be sure.
2011-04-19T05:57:20  <Naktibalda> 1d should have 50%, it's a huge difference
2011-04-19T05:57:35  <Stocha> I'm not talking about winning chances. I'm talking about quality of play.
2011-04-19T05:57:44  <Stocha> wich is a sort of parallel mettric.
2011-04-19T05:58:26  <Stocha> problem with winning chance, is that given enough time, you are supposed to find a 25K that beats a pro in a 3 game series.
2011-04-19T05:58:56  <sigh> sure, it's only an approximation... it breaks down
2011-04-19T05:59:10  <Stocha> Worst : if a pro do one game against every human living, i will losse against a 25k :p
2011-04-19T05:59:16  <sigh> but for ranks that aren't too far away it is good enough
2011-04-19T05:59:21  <Stocha> he
2011-04-19T05:59:39  <Stocha> i dunnow. it's only a metric.
2011-04-19T05:59:44  <Stocha> like QI
2011-04-19T06:00:06  <sigh> you have to have some way of ranking people... and this is quite good
2011-04-19T06:00:15  <sigh> you seem to dislike uncertainty :P
2011-04-19T06:02:05  <sigh> Stocha: here is the game where pachi won: http://files.gokgs.com/games/2011/4/14/nutngo1-pachi2.sgf
2011-04-19T06:02:58  <sigh> a human 3d would not have been able to kill that group :P
2011-04-19T06:03:26  <Naktibalda> Stocha: chances of pro loosing against 25k is 0.(0) with infinite number of zeroes

2011-04-19T06:11:48  <Sotcha> okay so it's a win at 7 stone. (how many cores/clusters were playing ?). Maybe it's the famous 1 over 1000000 game the 25k will win against the pro at 7 stone :p
2011-04-19T06:12:49  <sigh> 64 processors I think
2011-04-19T06:13:00  <sigh> regardless of anything else, that was an impressive kill
2011-04-19T06:13:02  <Sotcha> sigh: you wouldn't have killed the group ? you would have lost the game ?
2011-04-19T06:13:13  <sigh> I don't think I could have killed that group
2011-04-19T06:13:22  <Sotcha> form where ?
2011-04-19T06:14:17  <sigh> say move 70
2011-04-19T06:14:56  <Sotcha> against another 3d, you wouldn't be confident ?
2011-04-19T06:15:31  <sigh> at move 70 I would not be able to read a kill... I would attack though
2011-04-19T06:15:48  <Sotcha> maybe the bot was only trying to get a few sente moves.

2011-04-19T06:16:02  <Sotcha> he killed the group instead :p
2011-04-19T06:16:24  <sigh> anyway, my comment was in regard to playing a pro
2011-04-19T06:16:29  <Sotcha> naktibalda: what's that about go not being poker ? you mean poker is a sure thing, and go is all about chances of winning ?
2011-04-19T06:16:51  <Naktibalda> no, poker has a lot of luck involved
2011-04-19T06:17:01  <Naktibalda> and't it was proven in Sweden's court :)
2011-04-19T06:17:03  <Sotcha> Still it's only one game. I wonder about when they 'll show bot winning two game in a row.
2011-04-19T06:17:37  <Sotcha> even if you play 10000000000 poker game between a pro and a rookie, you have randomness built in ?
2011-04-19T06:17:52  <Sotcha> then go is like poker.
2011-04-19T06:18:02  <Naktibalda> rookie can win 20% or 40% of games
2011-04-19T06:18:03  <Sotcha> in that respect.
2011-04-19T06:18:12  <sigh> sure... bots aren't there quite yet to play pros on 7H... but that kill was above 3d level against a pro
2011-04-19T06:18:12  <Naktibalda> in go he could win 1, when pro is drunk
2011-04-19T06:18:24  <Sotcha> a poker game = 1 go move.
2011-04-19T06:18:27  <Naktibalda> I mean totally drunk
2011-04-19T06:18:30  <Sotcha> if by game you mean hand.
2011-04-19T06:18:44  <sigh> pros get stronger when they are drunk :P
2011-04-19T06:18:44  <Sotcha> a rooking playing one good move, is not beyond imagining.
2011-04-19T06:19:09  <Sotcha> i know a young french 3d that told me i was stronger when drunk.
2011-04-19T06:19:24  <Sotcha> i don't know if the beer is clouding his judgment or whatever.
2011-04-19T06:19:53  <sigh> :)
2011-04-19T06:20:16  <Sotcha> Still you can't compare a one pocker hand and a full 600 moves long go game.
2011-04-19T06:20:33  <sigh> go games don't last 600 moves o_O
2011-04-19T06:20:40  <Sotcha> don't they ?
2011-04-19T06:20:51  <Sotcha> what scoring do you use ?
2011-04-19T06:20:59  <Sotcha> i use stone count + eye count :p
2011-04-19T06:21:07  <Naktibalda> poor you
2011-04-19T06:21:17  <sigh> o_O
2011-04-19T06:21:35  <Sotcha> that's call chineese rule. and is compatible with french scoring :p
2011-04-19T06:21:56  <sigh> yeah... but it doesn't make the game significantly longer
2011-04-19T06:22:07  <sigh> just enough to fill in the dame
2011-04-19T06:22:24  <Sotcha> fill
2011-04-19T06:22:24  <Sotcha> No you also feel the inside.
2011-04-19T06:22:26  <sigh> longest go game is like 400 moves
2011-04-19T06:22:31  <sigh> why the inside?
2011-04-19T06:22:39  <sigh> that's ooooold rules, i think
2011-04-19T06:23:01  <Sotcha> well it's the same as counting inside that is sure territory, and dame.
2011-04-19T06:23:20  <Sotcha> but you can fill the inside up to when there is only stone and eyes. And count that for each players.
2011-04-19T06:23:30  <sigh> why do you fill in the inside?
2011-04-19T06:23:38  <Sotcha> because it doesn't change anything
2011-04-19T06:23:48  <Sotcha> and make counting easier :p
2011-04-19T06:24:08  <Sotcha> Well, 600 hundred moves is an approximation for length of go game played by bot that don't forfeit.
2011-04-19T06:24:19  <sigh> that's hardly part of the game... that's just part of counting...
2011-04-19T06:24:23  <sigh> bot games don't last that long
2011-04-19T06:24:36  <Sotcha> historically they did.
2011-04-19T06:24:43  <Sotcha> first mogo versions did that :p
2011-04-19T06:24:53  <Sotcha> it juste filled all empty point, until the opponent passed.
2011-04-19T06:24:57  <sigh> fair enough... but not anymore :)
2011-04-19T06:25:08  <Sotcha> or there was no empty point one point eye left.
2011-04-19T06:25:18  <Sotcha> ah, new days are bad days.
2011-04-19T06:25:38  <Sotcha> okay so let's say a go game is 100 moves.
2011-04-19T06:25:56  <Sotcha> and let me rephrase : it's not fair comparing a poker hand with a full 100 moves go game.
2011-04-19T06:25:57  <Naktibalda> there are 361 points on a board, it's hard to make more than 400 moves
2011-04-19T06:26:25  <Sotcha> Naktibalda : it would. if there was not that silly capturing rule.
2011-04-19T06:26:26  <sigh> Stocha: when you were talking about counting eyes, I thought you were talking about group tax http://senseis.xmp.net/?GroupTax
2011-04-19T06:26:40  <sigh> which is why I said it was oooooold
2011-04-19T06:26:49  <Sotcha> I designed a very nice scheme for a go bot once. And ended up with a good idea of an hex bot. there is no silly capture rule in hex.
2011-04-19T06:27:04  <sigh> Naktibalda: longest pro game is a bit over 400 moves
2011-04-19T06:27:07  <sigh> 411 i think
2011-04-19T06:27:50  <sigh> yup, 411 http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/special/records/longest.html
2011-04-19T06:28:17  <Sotcha> group tax would make the game a litle less weird i guess :p. But you don't need that for the counting i proposed.
2011-04-19T06:28:39  <sigh> yeah, I was confused as to what you were talking about :)
2011-04-19T06:29:40  <Sotcha> you can make almost arbritrarilly long game, without playing in one point eyes. by using kos.
2011-04-19T06:30:13  <Sotcha> i'm not very gifted with phrasing. lately.
2011-04-19T06:30:29  <sigh> you can extend the game a lot by capturing large group then playing inside them
2011-04-19T06:31:04  <Sotcha> yeah. ko are nice also :p because you can do that in more reasonable terms that putting your stone on 100% own territory :p
2011-04-19T06:31:28  <sigh> doesn't have to be your own territory
2011-04-19T06:31:37  <sigh> like this fun problem: http://senseis.xmp.net/?LargestCaptureThatStillCantLive
2011-04-19T06:31:54  <Sotcha> if it's 100% owned ennemy is the same. That's what i meant. owned.
2011-04-19T06:33:28  <Sotcha> i still have to find a replay in a 16 captured slot that is not 100% owned in an official game :p
2011-04-19T06:33:46  <Sotcha> well let's talk about ant then ...
2011-04-19T06:33:57  <sigh> :)
2011-04-19T06:33:59  <Sotcha> i don't understand this game.Ant i mean.

2011-04-19T06:35:07  <Sotcha> how many legal ant game is there up to 256x256 maps with two players starting with only one ant ?
2011-04-19T06:36:15  <sigh> depends on how food is spawned
2011-04-19T06:36:36  <Sotcha> counting legal game takes into account all possible food spawning.
2011-04-19T06:36:47  <Sotcha> obviously you need a super ko rule also.
2011-04-19T06:36:49  <Naktibalda> when you have 100 ants you have 4^100 variations for next move, approximatelly, correct?

2011-04-19T06:37:13  <Sotcha> that's sound like a lot.
2011-04-19T06:37:23  <sigh> that's an upper bound, yes
2011-04-19T06:37:46  <sigh> yeah, it's a lot
2011-04-19T06:37:53  <Sotcha> how many ant with 4 moves can you put on a 256x256 map ? :p
2011-04-19T06:38:01  <sigh> planet wars had a ridiculous number of possible moves too
2011-04-19T06:38:15  <Sotcha> because of cardinality ?
2011-04-19T06:38:25  <Sotcha> like sending 56 then 1 different from sending 1 then 56 ?
2011-04-19T06:38:41  <sigh> even without that
2011-04-19T06:39:00  <Sotcha> N planet x N-1 planet ? :p
2011-04-19T06:39:10  <sigh> say at the start, choosing which ships to send to which planets resulted in a huge number of moves
2011-04-19T06:39:21  <sigh> no, you have to decide number of ships too
2011-04-19T06:39:21  <Sotcha> at the start ?
2011-04-19T06:39:34  <sigh> yes, even at the start
2011-04-19T06:39:35  <Sotcha> one ship has only N-1 planet to go to.
2011-04-19T06:39:51  <sigh> you have 100 ships
2011-04-19T06:39:52  <Sotcha> so that's a cardinality thing.
2011-04-19T06:40:05  <Sotcha> that's still only 100xN
2011-04-19T06:40:14  <sigh> 100^N if you are naive
2011-04-19T06:40:20  <Sotcha> ah.

2011-04-19T06:40:36  <sigh> wrong way
2011-04-19T06:40:40  <sigh> yes
2011-04-19T06:41:06  <Sotcha> one ship has N possible dest doesn't it have ?
2011-04-19T06:41:08  <sigh> I meant naive meaning that N^100 counts the moves naively as it contains a lot of duplicates
