2010-11-18T00:01:02  <burny> if I make my AI do really well, but assume that the opponent does well also.. will I pretty much for sure end up in the top hundred?  or can my assumption that the opponent isn't lousy going to possibly hurt me while climbing the ranks?
2010-11-18T00:01:41  <antimatroid> burny: hard to say
2010-11-18T00:01:54  <antimatroid> i don't think it's that hard to get in the top 100 still
2010-11-18T00:02:30  <burny> like for instance.. if I assume the opponent doesn't send 100 at my base, or do nothing atall, on the first turn..
2010-11-18T00:03:09  <antimatroid> i'm not making any such assumption, but i'll consider them making such a move in my game tree if i leave it vulnerable
2010-11-18T00:04:41  <burny> cause aside from very specific maps.. doing nothing, or attacking, on the irst turn.. is a horrible move, and will never win
2010-11-18T00:05:06  <antimatroid> "never"?
2010-11-18T00:05:23  <burny> never against a bot that's any good
2010-11-18T00:05:59  <antimatroid> depends on the map
2010-11-18T00:06:10  <antimatroid> it's not going to do as well on average no

2010-11-18T00:06:47  <burny> there's almost no map, that doing nothing on turn 1, is a viable move
2010-11-18T00:06:49  <antimatroid> but if you can pick out when it's best to do that, then you do even better
2010-11-18T00:06:56  <antimatroid> i disagree
2010-11-18T00:07:04  <antimatroid> there was one with other day with 6 in the centre
2010-11-18T00:07:22  <antimatroid> on could take a neutral near their planet on the first turn, but if the other player waited they could then take the better center planet
2010-11-18T00:07:35  <burny> notice use of the term 'almost'
2010-11-18T00:07:59  <antimatroid> i think it will still happen

2010-11-18T01:18:09  <mega1> not pretty, but it's better than further biasing the density towards the edges
2010-11-18T01:18:12  <antimatroid> yeah, although i always place planets from 2 outwards with radius
2010-11-18T01:18:19  <antimatroid> should that be from 1.02 maybe?
2010-11-18T01:18:32  <McLeopold_> actually, it probably should
2010-11-18T01:18:41  <McLeopold_> mega1?
2010-11-18T01:19:00  <antimatroid> i think that should maybe be changed now that i think about it

2010-11-18T01:19:10  <Zannick> yeah
2010-11-18T01:19:15  <antimatroid> you could set it at 1 and it wouldn't matter
2010-11-18T01:19:17  <mega1> basing the minimum distance check on the actual distance would make the center even more sparse
2010-11-18T01:19:23  <antimatroid> because it would reject the integer distance from the centre planet
2010-11-18T01:19:57  <antimatroid> or would that matter?
2010-11-18T01:20:20  <McLeopold_> overall, it's better to generate any number, then throw out the result, than to generate a number in a specific range
2010-11-18T01:20:33  <McLeopold_> mega1 is agreeing
2010-11-18T01:20:46  <antimatroid> pickRadius should be from 1 to maxRadius then

2010-11-18T01:28:21  <McLeopold_> antimatroid: isn't there always a planet right in the center of the map?
2010-11-18T01:28:29  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-18T01:28:46  <McLeopold_> rand_radius is at 1, so it is correct
2010-11-18T01:28:46  <antimatroid> although, the "centre" isn't so clear for line symmetric maps
2010-11-18T01:29:12  <McLeopold_> I though it was still the center of the map area
2010-11-18T01:29:21  <antimatroid> it is
2010-11-18T01:30:02  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.81.216> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-11-18T01:30:05  <antimatroid> but it could be on the outside point of the convex hull around the map now
2010-11-18T01:30:19  <antimatroid> that would have been impossibly before unless all planets were on a line
2010-11-18T01:30:46  <antimatroid> well not quite
2010-11-18T01:30:47  <McLeopold_> you lost me
2010-11-18T01:31:08  <McLeopold_> so, center planet is center of map area or equidistant between home planets?
2010-11-18T01:31:22  <antimatroid> it's at (0,0)
2010-11-18T01:31:32  <McLeopold_> okay: then everything is fine
2010-11-18T01:31:34  <antimatroid> but the line joining the two home planets doesn't necessarily intersect that planet
2010-11-18T01:31:41  <McLeopold_> yeah, ok
2010-11-18T01:32:17  <McLeopold_> ah, I get the convex hull thing now
2010-11-18T01:32:29  <McLeopold_> if all theta were to one side of the map
2010-11-18T01:32:34  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-11-18T01:32:47  <McLeopold_> I haven't seen that yet
2010-11-18T01:33:04  <antimatroid> neither, it's just an extreme example as to why it's not such a "central" planet always anymore

2010-11-18T04:22:33  <antimatroid1> have any of you played minesweeper flags?
2010-11-18T04:22:41  <amstan> hmm>
2010-11-18T04:22:48  <antimatroid1> where you're actually trying to hit the most bombs, although it's not simultaneous
2010-11-18T04:23:11  <amstan> isn't it trivial?
2010-11-18T04:23:36  <antimatroid1> not sure, sometimes you only know the probability of a bomb being somewhere
2010-11-18T04:23:44  <antimatroid1> large parts of it probably are, and luck
2010-11-18T04:23:55  <antimatroid1> would be fun to just write such an ai anyway
2010-11-18T04:25:03  <amstan> you can do that in a day though
2010-11-18T04:26:22  <antimatroid1> it'd take longer than that
2010-11-18T04:26:35  <antimatroid1> but it probably wouldn't make for a great contest game, didn't think that through very well :P

2010-11-18T04:37:08  <tim__> hey, I just saw this challenge and downloaded the python starter package. however, it does not seem to work well and the forum are currently having sql problems.
2010-11-18T04:37:35  <tim__> i've got two problems. first, if java does not crash myBot.py times out in the first turn.
2010-11-18T04:38:03  <tim__> second, often java crashes instantly with Exception in thread "Thread-1" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1

2010-11-18T04:39:24  <lavalamp_> tim__ it could "time out" if it fails to actually start, you're sure you've got python set up and the path/command is correct etc?
2010-11-18T04:39:58  <tim__> lavalamp_, : yes, python should work. i'm using: java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "python myBot.py" "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-11-18T04:40:10  <tim__> just like in the starters guide
2010-11-18T04:40:20  <lavalamp_> hm looks right
2010-11-18T04:40:24  <antimatroid1> tim__: just a forewarning, the contest ends in a little over a week and is an almost 3 month contest
2010-11-18T04:40:33  <antimatroid1> don't let that stop you having some fun, just a warning :)
2010-11-18T04:40:47  <tim__> yes, i know, but thanks. I'm just in for some fun :)

2010-11-18T04:40:58  <lavalamp_> if you "python mybot.py" and type "go", does it say "go" back to you?

2010-11-18T04:43:52  <lavalamp_> it's better than the included tools ^^
2010-11-18T04:44:01  <antimatroid1> jBotManager is what I use
2010-11-18T04:44:51  <tim__> l,
2010-11-18T04:45:06  <tim__> where can I find documentation how to use it?
2010-11-18T04:47:01  <antimatroid1> just open the jar file :P
2010-11-18T04:47:11  <antimatroid1> it's pretty self explanatory how to use it after that
2010-11-18T04:47:47  <tim__> ok, I'll try that. need to reboot. thank you guys
2010-11-18T04:47:47  <antimatroid1> if you're playing in human mode, press a digit for it to send that proportion of the ships on that planet
2010-11-18T04:47:52  <antimatroid1> 0 == 100%

2010-11-18T05:02:30  <tim__> hey guys :-) first of all this JBotManager seems pretty nice :) I just let this default bot play against itself. is it normal that after eg bot 2 won over bot 1 it says "Player 1/2 Message: you have timed out"?
2010-11-18T05:07:12  <delt0r___> tim__: no
2010-11-18T05:07:23  <delt0r___> It should only do that if you really time out
2010-11-18T05:08:26  <delt0r___> however there is a few outstanding bugs --but thats not listed... mostly it will give you a lose when you have no fleets buts still own a planet
2010-11-18T05:08:56  <delt0r___> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=751
2010-11-18T05:09:31  <tim__> another thing I just saw is that letting the given bots play each other it always ends up in "illegal fleet requests"
2010-11-18T05:09:32  <delt0r___> also i just don't have time right now to fix anything.
2010-11-18T05:09:55  <delt0r___> well u need to set up your own bot command lines
2010-11-18T05:10:06  <delt0r___> they ones that are there by default won't work
2010-11-18T05:10:17  <tim__> oh, you're the guy who did it :-) thanks!
2010-11-18T05:10:37  <tim__> why is that so? did the rules change? are the bots just crappy?

2010-11-18T05:11:06  <delt0r___> your paths won't be right
2010-11-18T05:11:29  <delt0r___> it wont find anything untill you set up the bot command lines properly
2010-11-18T05:11:32  <tim__> the paths seem to work
2010-11-18T05:11:35  <delt0r___> just timeouts
2010-11-18T05:11:41  <tim__> yes it does find the bots
2010-11-18T05:11:57  <tim__> but they are playing some turns end then it ends up in an illegal fleet request
2010-11-18T05:12:27  <delt0r___> Well its never done this for me. The protocol has not changed so --i don't know
2010-11-18T05:12:39  <delt0r___> the server ignores #
2010-11-18T05:13:13  <delt0r___> check the standard error/out thats where most mesages get sent
2010-11-18T05:13:46  <delt0r___> sometimes if you get something wrong... the only way to fix it is with a restart... I though i got all those bugs --but you never know
2010-11-18T05:13:55  <delt0r___> It was always a little rought
2010-11-18T05:13:58  <delt0r___> rough

2010-11-18T09:17:17  <medrimonia> yes I know that it's against the rules, but the problem is just that when my bot run, it writes a file just to help me for debugging

2010-11-18T09:24:02  <andrei92> i will check again , thanks
2010-11-18T09:24:17  <antimatroid1> i
2010-11-18T09:24:25  <medrimonia> Maybe because you sent a negative number of ship
2010-11-18T09:24:28  <antimatroid1> i've taken all checks out of my code so i know it isn't buggy
2010-11-18T09:24:30  <medrimonia> or if you're on tcp
2010-11-18T09:24:39  <medrimonia> maybe you've sent 0 ships

2010-11-18T09:55:32  <Error323> because for a guy like us being away from the pcc that loong is unnatural :P

2010-11-18T10:25:28  <medrimonia> In fact the biggest problem is that I don't even go to classes

2010-11-18T11:41:09  <antimatroid1> i did try ctrl f5 numerous times
2010-11-18T11:41:13  <McLeopold> yeah, it doesn't send out good cache headers

2010-11-18T11:42:41  <antimatroid1> hmmm, that didn't do it, the rest of the internet seems to work, but i'll try the old power d/c method
2010-11-18T11:44:53  <lavalamp_> if it doesn't send out good cache headers, antimatroid's ISP might be incorrectly locally caching it

2010-11-18T11:45:47  <d0ugal> I kinda wish ai-contest would show a graph on player's profiles of their rank
2010-11-18T11:45:55  <antimatroid> .... and now it works :\
2010-11-18T11:46:04  <antimatroid> d0ugal: it did last time
2010-11-18T11:46:08  <d0ugal> Ah
2010-11-18T11:46:12  <antimatroid> and there was rankings for countries etc.
2010-11-18T11:46:18  <antimatroid> i don't know what they got rid of those things
2010-11-18T11:46:22  <d0ugal> I just think the number isn't that useful without the context because ranks go up and down so much
2010-11-18T11:46:34  <antimatroid> the old one was a graph of your ranking over time
2010-11-18T11:46:50  <d0ugal> That's be nice
2010-11-18T11:46:50  <d0ugal> That'd*
2010-11-18T11:47:22  <antimatroid> bocsimackos would be impressive
2010-11-18T11:47:43  <antimatroid> ideally it should do your modal rank over a certain period i think
2010-11-18T11:47:52  <antimatroid> otherwise you'd have huge jumps where people resubmit

2010-11-18T11:47:58  <antimatroid> well, possibly median
2010-11-18T11:48:10  <antimatroid> modal would only work well for bocsimacko :P
2010-11-18T11:48:13  <rebelxt> guys fyi: e-mailed dhartmei asking to update maps on his tcp server, but e-mails bounced marked as spam :( PM'ed him as well on the forum since he used to respond to PM
2010-11-18T11:48:24  <lavalamp_> graph should be of final rank for each submission
2010-11-18T11:48:39  <antimatroid> rebelxt: already tried emailing him and got the bounce like a week ago :)
2010-11-18T11:49:01  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: yep
2010-11-18T11:49:05  <antimatroid> that'd work well
2010-11-18T11:49:26  <antimatroid> would also show who resubmits all the time ehe
2010-11-18T11:49:38  <lavalamp_> ...and maybe it should graph percentile, not elo or place #
2010-11-18T11:50:04  <lavalamp_> since both of those depends on how many other people have entries
2010-11-18T11:51:01  <d0ugal> antimatroid: I'd settle for a new graph per submission
2010-11-18T11:51:37  <antimatroid> i prefer lavalamps idea
2010-11-18T11:51:38  <rebelxt> antimatroid: he is still paying for the server so he is around.. probably just busy with RL stuff
2010-11-18T11:51:53  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm pretty sure he has the server for more than just that
2010-11-18T11:52:03  <antimatroid> it doesn't require too much traffic to do the tcp thing i don't think
2010-11-18T11:52:12  <antimatroid> (not taking away from how awesome he is)
2010-11-18T11:52:30  <d0ugal> hmm, maybe - but you'd have to do a shed load of submissions to make interesting graphs
2010-11-18T11:52:47  <antimatroid> you don't want interesting graphs
2010-11-18T11:53:00  <antimatroid> just a basic idea of how the user progressed through the tournament
2010-11-18T11:53:25  <d0ugal> Suppose'
2010-11-18T11:53:32  <d0ugal> but I also really want interesting graphs :)
2010-11-18T11:53:36  <jmcarthur> i thought the graphs were fine last time as they were
2010-11-18T11:53:50  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: so what happened to them? :P
2010-11-18T11:53:54  <antimatroid> and the country rankings
2010-11-18T11:54:13  <jmcarthur> they went up and down a lot since they showed your rank continuously even when you resubmitted, but you could still see through the noise when you wanted to only compare your final rank at any point
2010-11-18T11:54:37  <jmcarthur> and it also worked well for those cases that you didn't submit often. you could see how your bot was falling as others got better
2010-11-18T11:54:49  <jmcarthur> it was actually kind of motivating, IMO
2010-11-18T11:54:58  <jmcarthur> "i better get off my ass and make this thing better!"
2010-11-18T11:55:03  <d0ugal> heh

2010-11-18T11:55:12  <d0ugal> So you must have thought we were too motivated and removed em?
2010-11-18T11:55:14  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i have no idea why they are gone
2010-11-18T11:55:32  <antimatroid> yeah, that's why i would think maybe a kind of average value over a smaller time period say 6-12 hours
2010-11-18T11:55:35  <lavalamp_> graph of a single submission is not meaningful because the submission plays at a constant level
2010-11-18T11:55:38  <jmcarthur> d0ugal: if i had been a decision maker i would have left them in, unless there is information i don't know about
2010-11-18T11:55:48  <jmcarthur> lavalamp_: not true
2010-11-18T11:55:49  <d0ugal> Fair 'nuff
2010-11-18T11:55:49  <antimatroid> so you could potentially avoid the bumps at resubmissions but capture the changes over longer time periods
2010-11-18T11:55:59  <d0ugal> Guess the graphs would be fairly process intensive
2010-11-18T11:56:00  <jmcarthur> lavalamp_: other bots improve, so your submission drops over time
2010-11-18T11:56:05  <d0ugal> but probably not that much more
2010-11-18T11:56:12  <d0ugal> and lots of results to store too..
2010-11-18T11:56:28  <lavalamp_> jmcarthur, yeah ok but I don't think that's why people want to watch graphs ^^
2010-11-18T11:56:37  <jmcarthur> lavalamp_: were you around for the last contest?
2010-11-18T11:56:42  <lavalamp_> nope
2010-11-18T11:56:50  <jmcarthur> it worked pretty well as a continuous graph of rank, IMO
2010-11-18T11:57:03  <lavalamp_> I wish I'd known about this one when it started and not a month later :(
2010-11-18T11:57:26  <lavalamp_> I can believe that
2010-11-18T11:57:30  <antimatroid> i found out about this one a few days before it opened
2010-11-18T11:57:42  <antimatroid> someone stumbled across the new page and posted it on reddit
2010-11-18T11:57:53  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: or maybe the smoothing could be weighted by time since last submission rather than a constant sliding window
2010-11-18T11:58:02  <jmcarthur> not sure what that would look like, but it might be nice
2010-11-18T11:58:23  <antimatroid> yeah, doesn't need to be perfect, just give a decent idea of how one has done/ is doing
2010-11-18T11:58:55  <jmcarthur> actually, if we were using trueskill we could just show the mean score for the graph. it wouldn't change upon resubmission. it would just become more bouncy for a while
2010-11-18T11:59:12  <antimatroid> how does trueskill work?
2010-11-18T11:59:13  <jmcarthur> or perhaps lower bound
2010-11-18T11:59:23  <jmcarthur> ah no not lower bound
2010-11-18T11:59:28  * antimatroid is very unknowledgable on ranking methods
2010-11-18T12:00:29  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it's complicated, but essentially you have a running mean and a running confidence interval, and both are taken into acount for each game. unlike bayeselo, it's iterative. there's also a well-studied leaderboard-ranking and matching algorithm that comes with it
2010-11-18T12:00:46  <jmcarthur> s/running confidence interval/running deviation/
2010-11-18T12:00:56  <jmcarthur> confidence interval i suppose *is* the combination of both
2010-11-18T12:01:57  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i forget who now, but somebody ran some tests with it on this contest and said it gave bad results, but i suspect that it wasn't being used as intended. the matching algorithm is designed to maximize the information gained from each game and stuff
2010-11-18T12:02:36  <jmcarthur> the matching algorithm is also probabilistic, so you still get variety
2010-11-18T12:03:02  <jmcarthur> i rather like trueskill on paper, but i admit i have never used it for anything
2010-11-18T12:03:11  <jmcarthur> seems to work well on xbox live though
2010-11-18T12:03:44  *** mega1 <mega1!~quassel@2001:470:1f05:548:215:58ff:fe7d:773b> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-18T12:04:52  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2010-11-18T12:06:00  <lavalamp_> trueskill is intended for contestants that vary in strength over time, which only happens here during resubmissions
2010-11-18T12:06:36  <lavalamp_> if it was used then maybe you wouldn't have to clear history every time people resubmit
2010-11-18T12:07:24  <jmcarthur> lavalamp_: right that was why i was pushing for it earlier in the contest
2010-11-18T12:07:32  <lavalamp_> ah
2010-11-18T12:07:53  <jmcarthur> lavalamp_: a small tweak to the algorithm would even make it assume bots keep the same skill level until they are resubmitted
2010-11-18T12:08:01  <lavalamp_> conversely maybe it doesn't work well for contestants of constant strength?
2010-11-18T12:08:09  <lavalamp_> jmcarthur: yeah that would be awesome
2010-11-18T12:08:13  <lavalamp_> on paper anyway
2010-11-18T12:08:32  <jmcarthur> unfortunately the only way to test it is to also pick up its matching algorithm and stuff
2010-11-18T12:09:10  <lavalamp_> would that be too bad?
2010-11-18T12:09:39  <lavalamp_> the current matching algorithm... leaves room for improvement
2010-11-18T12:09:39  <jmcarthur> well, i think it would be at this point. we should have done it earlier. we could have always reverted back if it did turn out badly
2010-11-18T12:09:52  <lavalamp_> oh yeah it's too late now, definitely
2010-11-18T12:09:54  <jmcarthur> people are just resistant to change :\
2010-11-18T12:10:20  <lavalamp_> but I strongly believe that the final should not be determined by a rating algorithm
2010-11-18T12:10:30  <lavalamp_> because of intransitivities
2010-11-18T12:10:33  <jmcarthur> IMO one of the nice things about the games not counting until the final tournament is that we can experiment with things like this
2010-11-18T12:10:50  <jmcarthur> but very few other people seem to share my view
2010-11-18T12:10:54  <lavalamp_> rating algorithm can determine seed # into a tournament of some kind
2010-11-18T12:11:17  <lavalamp_> jmcarthur I'll vote for you ^^
2010-11-18T12:11:20  <jmcarthur> ha
2010-11-18T12:11:26  <jmcarthur> i'm not even an organizer
2010-11-18T12:11:27  <dmj111> jmcarthur: i also think trueskill would be a good idea.
2010-11-18T12:11:44  <jmcarthur> i do agree with lavalamp_ that it would be a poor choice for the tournament
2010-11-18T12:11:58  <jmcarthur> i just think it would be about ideal for the three month testing period
2010-11-18T12:12:01  <lavalamp_> I think a series of round-robin tournaments would be best
2010-11-18T12:12:13  <jmcarthur> i'm not going to guess what would be best for the tournament
2010-11-18T12:12:14  <dmj111> yes, i agree, for the runup.
2010-11-18T12:12:34  <jmcarthur> i'd rather suggest things that have very well established backgrounds for it, and i don't know the literature well enough
2010-11-18T12:13:42  <dmj111> i keep thinking running swiss tournaments over and over again for the final tournament.
2010-11-18T12:13:50  <dmj111> as many as time permits.
2010-11-18T12:14:16  <lavalamp_> dmj111: or one looooong one
2010-11-18T12:14:25  <lavalamp_> you can always just keep adding rounds
2010-11-18T12:14:27  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: what about a merge sort like process with the final round being round robbins?
2010-11-18T12:14:32  <dmj111> Hmmmm.  Sure, that would work :)
2010-11-18T12:15:13  <lavalamp_> antimatroid: it would be interesting to try that and see what results it gives!
2010-11-18T12:15:14  <dmj111> antimatroid: i think a reealllly long swiss would end up looking like a round robin at the top, and every bot would still play the same number of games.
2010-11-18T12:15:26  <lavalamp_> yeah, that's correct
2010-11-18T12:15:43  <dmj111> maybe the last half day for only the top, or something, but I like everyone getting to play.
2010-11-18T12:15:45  <lavalamp_> the large RL tournaments I've been to are all swiss
2010-11-18T12:15:46  <antimatroid> so do completely random pairings inside groups, after certain time intervals, split groups in half, repeat, then in the final round with groupd of like 25, round robbin the shit out of that
2010-11-18T12:16:10  <lavalamp_> some variation of swiss I should say
2010-11-18T12:16:13  <antimatroid> and yeah, i'd give the top group a full day to itself
2010-11-18T12:16:44  <antimatroid> i think a bunch of these need to be tried with the submitted bots after this contest is run
2010-11-18T12:16:49  <antimatroid> and see what the different results are
2010-11-18T12:16:56  <lavalamp_> absolutely agree with that
2010-11-18T12:17:16  <lavalamp_> so that next time they know what to do
2010-11-18T12:17:47  <dmj111> after this is over, I was going to try some experiments like that.  I have a two player true skill program written too, so I wanted to see how it did too.
2010-11-18T12:17:48  <antimatroid> i'm only willing to contribute so far as i'm still eligible to compete
2010-11-18T12:17:57  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3812), bix0r4ever(3753), Raschi(3670), protocolocon(3582), luksian(3563), davidjliu(3560), smiley1983(3549), george(3537), shangas(3530), jimrogerz(3530)
2010-11-18T12:18:07  <lavalamp_> same here ^^
2010-11-18T12:18:14  <antimatroid> i expect a lot of people are in that boat
2010-11-18T12:18:16  <dmj111> oh, antimatroid yeah, my bot is all messed up.
2010-11-18T12:18:27  <antimatroid> i noticed :P
2010-11-18T12:18:35  <antimatroid> i'm ironing out minimax
2010-11-18T12:18:37  <jmcarthur> 9 rounds of swiss apparently should be enough for a clear winner
2010-11-18T12:18:48  <antimatroid> i think i have state calculations right, i just need to get evaluation working properly
2010-11-18T12:19:04  <lavalamp_> jmcarthur: that's equilent to a single elimination tournament at the top
2010-11-18T12:19:05  <jmcarthur> according to wikipedia: "Determining a clear winner (and, incidentally, a clear loser) usually requires the same number of rounds as a knockout tournament, that is the binary logarithm of the number of players rounded up."
2010-11-18T12:19:20  <dmj111> how many players are you assuming?
2010-11-18T12:19:27  <jmcarthur> the number we have in the tournament currently
2010-11-18T12:19:46  <dmj111> it would take 2**9 is only 512, isn't it?
2010-11-18T12:19:49  <lavalamp_> single elimination is definitely not good for this type of contest
2010-11-18T12:19:49  <antimatroid> the last tournament have like 750 bots entered into the final contest, this will presumable have a little over 4000
2010-11-18T12:19:55  <antimatroid> if it keeps growing..
2010-11-18T12:19:59  <jmcarthur> hmm maybe i used the wrong log base
2010-11-18T12:20:05  <antimatroid> had*
2010-11-18T12:20:05  <jmcarthur> you're right of course
2010-11-18T12:20:06  <dmj111> 13 rounds.
2010-11-18T12:20:22  <jmcarthur> yeah that sounds right
2010-11-18T12:20:31  <dmj111> (too much time using FFT's with power of two sizes...)
2010-11-18T12:21:01  <antimatroid> although are there really any people with bots ranked below 1000 that are actually trying?
2010-11-18T12:21:17  <antimatroid> i see bots submitted right at the start from people at those ranks
2010-11-18T12:21:31  <lavalamp_> but if you keep adding rounds to a swiss it will be more and more like a round robin at the top, which would be very very good
2010-11-18T12:22:02  <dmj111> antimatroid: yeah.. but how can we avoid dropping people ranked that low who are trying?  I have a coworker ~1500 who likes to keep watching his play, even if he hasn't changed it.
2010-11-18T12:22:16  <dmj111> and, i just contradicted myself.
2010-11-18T12:23:06  <antimatroid> yeah, i do advocate for giving those people a decent go
2010-11-18T12:23:27  <antimatroid> would he be opposed to having to resubmit every few weeks?
2010-11-18T12:23:42  <antimatroid> as a guess
2010-11-18T12:24:11  <antimatroid> probably not ideal
2010-11-18T12:24:17  <dmj111> No, in fact I wrote an issue on the issue tracker suggesting something like that.  His idea as an arcade analogy... log in and click a button to drop a quarter in the machine, and get 50 more games.
2010-11-18T12:24:33  <antimatroid> yeah, that'd be good
2010-11-18T12:24:34  <lavalamp_> run a tournament with everyone for a day, then drop the bottom half. rinse and repeat.
2010-11-18T12:24:48  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: don't give the bottom people good enough rankings
2010-11-18T12:24:55  <antimatroid> some of those people may have spent 3 months on their bot
2010-11-18T12:25:07  <lavalamp_> good point
2010-11-18T12:25:29  <lavalamp_> oh awesome, there's now 6 submissions in go: http://ai-contest.com/language_profile.php?lang=Go
2010-11-18T12:26:25  <lavalamp_> yeah, I guess swiss tournament with as many rounds as possible is my ideal final
2010-11-18T12:26:44  <lavalamp_> maybe with extra rounds for the top 100
2010-11-18T12:26:58  <jmcarthur> now, i don't know much about tournament systems, but what's wrong with an n-elimination tournament for some large value of n? does n just have to be too large to be practical?
2010-11-18T12:28:03  <jmcarthur> the advantages of swiss over knockout given on wikipedia seem to mainly be that if you aren't limited to a certain number of games at a time it might converge more quickly... but we *are* limited to a certain number of games at a time
2010-11-18T12:29:05  <jmcarthur> oh, and swiss doesn't eliminate people of course, so you get to determine a clear loser as well as a clear winner
2010-11-18T12:29:22  <jmcarthur> "Compared with a round-robin tournament, a Swiss can handle many players without requiring an impractical number of rounds. An elimination tournament is better suited to a situation in which only a limited number of games may be played at once, e.g. tennis. In a Swiss system, all players can be playing a round at the same time."
2010-11-18T12:32:02  <antimatroid> name something that isn't limited to number of games at a time?
2010-11-18T12:32:12  <jmcarthur> chess
2010-11-18T12:32:17  <antimatroid> how?
2010-11-18T12:32:23  <antimatroid> there's a finite number of chess boards on earth
2010-11-18T12:32:26  <jmcarthur> every player can play at the same time
2010-11-18T12:32:28  <antimatroid> and finite number of people
2010-11-18T12:32:29  <jmcarthur> *sigh*
2010-11-18T12:32:33  <antimatroid> oh, :P
2010-11-18T12:32:37  <jmcarthur> practically it's possible :P
2010-11-18T12:32:50  <antimatroid> okay, i get it now
2010-11-18T12:32:53  <antimatroid> i takes things literally
2010-11-18T12:32:59  <antimatroid> too much sometimes
2010-11-18T12:33:44  <antimatroid> so clearly the solution is to get enough servers such that every bot can play at once :P
2010-11-18T12:34:21  <jmcarthur> just as the solution in tennis tournaments it to buy enough tennis courts that every player can play at once
2010-11-18T12:34:23  <JamesMG> have everyone install something and leave a port open for the 3 days...
2010-11-18T12:34:25  <jmcarthur> *is to buy
2010-11-18T12:34:30  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-18T12:34:58  <antimatroid> JamesMG: can't do it through tcp like ways
2010-11-18T12:35:17  <antimatroid> people use whatever computing power they want, and if you have a crap connection, say goodbye to a good rank
2010-11-18T12:35:29  <JamesMG> it's impractical for other reasons too
2010-11-18T12:35:43  <antimatroid> bots change
2010-11-18T12:35:47  <antimatroid> etc. etc. yeah
2010-11-18T12:40:20  <p4p4> hey, in my dream, i solved it ! man, it was soo easy, i just assumed, i'd own all planets and just A*'ed backwards!
2010-11-18T12:40:56  <jmcarthur> haha
2010-11-18T12:40:57  <JamesMG> haha
2010-11-18T12:41:24  <jmcarthur> that's awesome
2010-11-18T12:41:45  <antimatroid>  lol
2010-11-18T12:48:29  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7834518
2010-11-18T12:48:37  <antimatroid> bocsimacko was a bit unlucky there
2010-11-18T12:48:52  <antimatroid> i think he had the win if the turn limit was different
2010-11-18T12:49:42  <jmcarthur> it looks like a clear early mistake to me
2010-11-18T12:50:16  <jmcarthur> didn't take as many planets as bix0r4ever
2010-11-18T12:50:40  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-11-18T12:50:41  <antimatroid> yeah, but assuming bix0r didn't manage to take the planet with 5 ships at the end
2010-11-18T12:50:44  <jmcarthur> but it did waver a bit anyway
2010-11-18T12:50:46  <jmcarthur> nevermind
2010-11-18T12:50:58  <antimatroid> it'd put him behind to catch up on growth
2010-11-18T12:51:14  <jmcarthur> the point is that the advantage was held almost the entire time
2010-11-18T12:51:31  <antimatroid> my point is that excluding time limits, it probably would have switched
2010-11-18T12:51:56  <antimatroid> sure it is now the game to optimise for turn 200
2010-11-18T12:52:11  <antimatroid> just making a comment on the fact that the outcome out have been different if the turn limit was different
2010-11-18T12:52:17  <antimatroid> might* have
2010-11-18T12:52:24  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-18T12:52:30  <jmcarthur> i am still unconvinced that time limits taint the game
2010-11-18T12:52:37  <jmcarthur> to me they are simply a part of it
2010-11-18T12:52:43  <jmcarthur> especially now that it's actually in stone
2010-11-18T12:52:44  <antimatroid> i think it's very rare that games like that happen
2010-11-18T12:52:46  <antimatroid> but i have had a few
2010-11-18T12:52:59  <jmcarthur> it was always the game to optimize for turn n, we just didn't decide what n should be until recently
2010-11-18T12:53:01  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-11-18T12:53:08  <jmcarthur> no debate there
2010-11-18T12:53:18  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't mind at all, i understand it has to happen
2010-11-18T12:53:23  <antimatroid> it was merely a comment :P

2010-11-18T12:53:47  <jmcarthur> but then again, if the turn limit was different then many bots would also be coded differently. we can't really guess what bots are good at what turn limits
2010-11-18T12:53:48  <antimatroid> woah, dhartmei posted in the forums
2010-11-18T12:53:56  <jmcarthur> well, different constants in the code at least
2010-11-18T12:54:04  <jmcarthur> which can have big effects
2010-11-18T12:54:04  <antimatroid> new maps are on benzadrine
2010-11-18T12:54:09  <antimatroid> Accoun: ^^
2010-11-18T12:55:27  <phreeza> nice
2010-11-18T12:57:32  <bhasker> hey so is the dhartmei's server running the new maps now?
2010-11-18T12:57:53  <antimatroid> he added janzerts 50 maps and 450 he generated with the current generator
2010-11-18T12:57:55  <mega1> antimatroid: the benzendrine visualizer has some problems with the new maps
2010-11-18T12:57:57  <antimatroid> i expect old maps are stil there

2010-11-18T13:00:03  <antimatroid> i've no idea when dhartmei will next be on the forums, hopefully he will check again or the games
2010-11-18T13:00:43  <antimatroid> mega1: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7834518 do you think you would have won that given more time?
2010-11-18T13:01:04  <antimatroid> not that it really matters, i just find it interesting when results probably would have changed
2010-11-18T13:01:48  <antimatroid> i can't tell if you're about to lose the planet with 5 ships or not, i think it depends on that
2010-11-18T13:02:48  <mega1> antimatroid: possible, but my bot was rather braindead several times. Deserved to lose.
2010-11-18T13:02:53  <janzert> rather surprising to me it appears draws between top 100 competitors is much lower than overall draw rate on the drawish maps
2010-11-18T13:03:41  <antimatroid> janzert: not really
2010-11-18T13:03:57  <antimatroid> stupid bots are more likely to not see any possible moves
2010-11-18T13:04:15  <antimatroid> whereas smarter bots will see a game that is actually there to be played
2010-11-18T13:04:31  <antimatroid> so the stupider bots are drawing on maps that shouldn't necessarily be draws
2010-11-18T13:04:38  <antimatroid> at least that'd be what i'd have thought
2010-11-18T13:04:44  <janzert> that seems to be what is happening anyway
2010-11-18T13:05:05  <antimatroid> one of my problems is my stupid bot deciding it'd be best to just sit there
2010-11-18T13:05:06  <janzert> I thought it was more likely for the smarter bots to see when a map was truly a draw and play for it
2010-11-18T13:05:23  <antimatroid> i don't think they happen as often as a stupid bot misses possible moves
2010-11-18T13:05:32  <antimatroid> well, clearly :P
2010-11-18T13:05:38  <antimatroid> otherwise we wouldn't be discussing this
2010-11-18T13:06:08  <antimatroid> also, there are now checks in to try and remove those very trivial draw maps
2010-11-18T13:07:16  <janzert> yeah, must be effective :)
2010-11-18T13:07:44  <janzert> is there a map in the current set that is a theoretical draw even though the simple draw is avoided?
2010-11-18T13:07:54  <antimatroid> not sure sorry
2010-11-18T13:07:58  <janzert> ok
2010-11-18T13:08:09  <antimatroid> mcleopolds server might be possible to find one
2010-11-18T13:08:29  <antimatroid> http://zeroviz.us:8080/by_Map.html
2010-11-18T13:08:32  <antimatroid> sort by draw percent
2010-11-18T13:09:12  <janzert> on the contest server with name, overall games, draws, top 100 games, draws
2010-11-18T13:09:14  <janzert> map_r528_4 2   16662 402 (2.4%)   127 9 (7.1%)
2010-11-18T13:09:31  <janzert> is the highest draw percentage among top 100
2010-11-18T13:09:34  <antimatroid> what's r528_17 like?
2010-11-18T13:09:49  <antimatroid> that has 25% draws on zeroviz, but look at it
2010-11-18T13:09:54  <antimatroid> http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=179
2010-11-18T13:10:02  <janzert> map_r528_27 2   16707 369 (2.2%)   111  (0.0%)
2010-11-18T13:10:07  <janzert> no draws in top 100
2010-11-18T13:10:16  <janzert> oops, wrong one
2010-11-18T13:10:31  <janzert> map_r528_17 2   16335 2133 (13.1%)   104  (0.0%)
2010-11-18T13:12:24  <janzert> I was going to remove maps that hit a draw percentage of something like 10 or 20 percent among games between top 100...
2010-11-18T13:13:00  <janzert> while that seems like it's still a good idea it appears fairly unlikely with the current generator
2010-11-18T13:13:17  <antimatroid> i would have thought even that kind of number is fairly acceptable
2010-11-18T13:13:21  <mega1> janzert: and you'd risk removing maps that are not draws
2010-11-18T13:13:51  <janzert> mega1: yes, there is that risk
2010-11-18T13:13:52  <mega1> it sucks to get a draw map, but it also sucks to get a map removed that your bot plays well on
2010-11-18T13:14:05  <antimatroid> yeah, i saw leave them
2010-11-18T13:14:08  <antimatroid> say*
2010-11-18T13:14:20  <janzert> there are a fair number of the new maps that get ~30% draw rates overall though
2010-11-18T13:14:44  <janzert> map_r538_15 1   1383 420 (30.4%)   15  (0.0%)
2010-11-18T13:15:24  <janzert> actually here http://ai-contest.com/map_stats.php but please don't post it in the forums
2010-11-18T13:16:06  <janzert> the query takes a few seconds to run and I don't want to have it hit too many times
2010-11-18T13:16:36  <antimatroid> http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=7047
2010-11-18T13:16:39  <antimatroid> that's the map
2010-11-18T13:16:48  <antimatroid> i think it might be a draw map
2010-11-18T13:16:49  <antimatroid> mega1?
2010-11-18T13:17:12  <antimatroid> although even if it's a draw map in perfect play, a lot of top bots might fail on it
2010-11-18T13:17:27  <antimatroid> so i think ideally that 30% number is stil more than acceptable
2010-11-18T13:17:37  <antimatroid> i'd probably be inclined to keep it if it was up to me
2010-11-18T13:17:47  <mega1> that's not a trivial draw map in my book at all
2010-11-18T13:17:58  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3719), bix0r4ever(3623), Raschi(3505), protocolocon(3488), davidjliu(3455), smiley1983(3446), george(3442), shangas(3432), luksian(3418), asavis(3408)
2010-11-18T13:18:13  <janzert> yeah, I guess unless I see maps hitting really high percentages I'll leave it alone
2010-11-18T13:18:14  <antimatroid> i can't tell easily without distances
2010-11-18T13:19:11  <mega1> I think the only ones we _may_ want to remove are the maps that are proven draws and they are also have high draw % in practice
2010-11-18T13:19:41  <antimatroid> and i don't think it's even going to happen
2010-11-18T13:19:57  <antimatroid> janzert: any idea of how many maps we'll be looking at having used?
2010-11-18T13:20:17  <janzert> not really
2010-11-18T13:20:58  <janzert> > 30 < 100000 :)

2010-11-18T13:38:33  <McLeopold> the map generator v528 produced a larger percentage of draw maps.
2010-11-18T13:39:13  <McLeopold> I'm itching to make an example of one of the maps, but their too good.
2010-11-18T13:39:28  <antimatroid> what?
2010-11-18T13:39:58  <McLeopold> nvm
2010-11-18T13:40:06  <McLeopold> 200 turns map http://zeroviz.us:8080/zeroviz_538_10.txt.html
2010-11-18T13:40:22  <Zoost> hum...what's changed in 538 compared to 528? Im crashing in EVERY game now
2010-11-18T13:40:35  <McLeopold> no enough to cause that
2010-11-18T13:40:47  <McLeopold> maybe max distance?
2010-11-18T13:40:59  <McLeopold> or planet count?
2010-11-18T13:41:06  <Zoost> wasnt it 24 in 528?
2010-11-18T13:41:07  <antimatroid> yeah, you have upper limit of 30 planets * 34 distance
2010-11-18T13:41:09  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-18T13:41:11  <Zoost> ah
2010-11-18T13:41:13  <Zoost> I see
2010-11-18T13:41:16  <antimatroid> but it was 34 before that
2010-11-18T13:41:20  <Zoost> makes perfect sense :)
2010-11-18T13:41:21  <antimatroid> i made a mistake
2010-11-18T13:41:25  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-18T13:41:35  <McLeopold> 30 distance, not 34
2010-11-18T13:41:35  <antimatroid> i made many mistakes actually, that was one of them
2010-11-18T13:41:43  <Zoost> yeah I just read its going to change to 24 so I removed the extra prediction and hard coded it to 24
2010-11-18T13:41:57  <antimatroid> 30? is that for same map area?
2010-11-18T13:42:05  <McLeopold> radius 15
2010-11-18T13:42:27  <Zoost> alright. Thanks for this, got to fix it it when Ive got time
2010-11-18T13:42:36  <lavalamp_> final max distance is going to be 30 just to be totally clear
2010-11-18T13:42:44  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-18T13:42:45  <McLeopold> that was a compromise to balance max distance and density
2010-11-18T13:43:00  <lavalamp_> ...but my bot will still detect it :P
2010-11-18T13:43:07  <McLeopold> previous maps were 24x24 in area with 23 planets
2010-11-18T13:43:19  <antimatroid> so 30*62 is my current max number of states :|
2010-11-18T13:43:35  <antimatroid> i think i can handle it
2010-11-18T13:44:03  <antimatroid> although the way i'm currently doing stuff, i think i could shipd that 62 in half
2010-11-18T13:44:11  <antimatroid> chop**
2010-11-18T13:44:27  <antimatroid> shipd is not even close to chopped, it's 5:44am, night :)
2010-11-18T13:44:30  <McLeopold> that was an area/planet ratio of 25.0
2010-11-18T13:44:52  <McLeopold> at 23 planets, radius 15, its now 30.7
2010-11-18T13:45:20  <McLeopold> at 30 planets, it's now 23.56
2010-11-18T13:45:41  <McLeopold> hmm... looks like maps will be less dense
2010-11-18T13:46:14  <antimatroid> i think i'm pretty happy with the generalness of maps
2010-11-18T13:46:24  <McLeopold> yes

2010-11-18T13:46:59  <McLeopold> actually, it's hard to compare densities with different shaps, because distance has a big affect
2010-11-18T13:47:35  <antimatroid> density inside the convex hull?
2010-11-18T13:48:01  <antimatroid> would total lenght of the min span tree be useful at all?
2010-11-18T13:48:06  <antimatroid> length*

2010-11-18T13:48:47  <antimatroid> i wouldn't like to be the one to work out how to calculate that first one
2010-11-18T13:49:53  <McLeopold> yell loudly when I break the visualizer
2010-11-18T13:49:58  <McLeopold> if
2010-11-18T13:53:00  <antimatroid> one thing that irritates me for no reason at all is that the mouse over planet showing reverses for the "dominant" planet, even when you're still not on the boundary of the undominant one
2010-11-18T13:53:03  <antimatroid> if that makes any sense
2010-11-18T13:53:16  <antimatroid> it really doesn't matter at all, i'm just making a comment about it annoying me :P
2010-11-18T13:53:25  <antimatroid> the fixes are awesome otherwise
2010-11-18T13:54:16  <McLeopold> I don't understand
2010-11-18T13:54:42  <antimatroid> you know how if i put my mouse over a "behind" planet it comes to the front?"
2010-11-18T13:55:11  <antimatroid> if i move the mouse back over to the original dominant planet, without actually going outside the new dominant circle, it switches back over to the old one
2010-11-18T13:55:20  <McLeopold> oh, I see
2010-11-18T13:55:21  <antimatroid> it's really unimportant
2010-11-18T13:55:34  <McLeopold> I just hooked into the active planet stuff
2010-11-18T13:55:58  <McLeopold> I think they would need to do a distance check rather than a boundary check
2010-11-18T13:56:24  <antimatroid> it really wasn't necessary to pass the distances and growths of planets to us every turn
2010-11-18T13:56:36  <antimatroid> although that'd be interesting, a game where new neutrals pop up as the game progresses
2010-11-18T13:56:56  <antimatroid> i couldn't handle that atm
2010-11-18T13:57:00  <McLeopold> or your planet gets nuked
2010-11-18T13:57:04  <lavalamp_> ooo dynamic maps.... that would break me totally
2010-11-18T13:57:27  <antimatroid> it would be a rather stupid game
2010-11-18T13:57:27  <McLeopold> it might break me in a few spots, but not much
2010-11-18T13:57:29  <antimatroid> but fun to watch
2010-11-18T13:57:38  <McLeopold> no more draws
2010-11-18T13:57:50  <lavalamp_> I pre-calculate a bunch of distance tables
2010-11-18T13:57:53  <McLeopold> if no neutral captures for 20 turns, pop up new planets
2010-11-18T13:57:57  <antimatroid> you'd probably want to bound planet maximums too
2010-11-18T13:58:01  <antimatroid> so might have to nuke planets
2010-11-18T13:58:28  <lavalamp_> better than adding a new neutral, just subtract ships from existing ones
2010-11-18T13:58:33  <antimatroid> this game deserves much more time devotion than a 3 month contest
2010-11-18T13:58:37  <antimatroid> it's rather complicated
2010-11-18T13:58:38  <McLeopold> too bad you can't do scorched earth
2010-11-18T13:58:58  <lavalamp_> take a planet and destroy it?
2010-11-18T13:59:03  <McLeopold> if you're going to lose a planet and there is nothing you can do, sacrifice your ships to reduce growth to 0
2010-11-18T13:59:09  <lavalamp_> hehe that would be awesome
2010-11-18T13:59:16  <antimatroid> netrual planets could work in reverse with growth
2010-11-18T13:59:17  <lavalamp_> defense becomes super important
2010-11-18T13:59:19  <antimatroid> till reaching 0
2010-11-18T13:59:43  <lavalamp_> you could take an enemy planet just for a turn and destroy it
2010-11-18T13:59:49  <McLeopold> yeah :)
2010-11-18T13:59:49  <antimatroid> or make it a real brain fuck and do proportional growth rates

2010-11-18T14:02:48  <lavalamp_> how about have the planets move along predefined paths? like orbiting the center planet...
2010-11-18T14:03:22  <McLeopold> so you can increase growth by consolidating?
2010-11-18T14:03:34  <McLeopold> or increase growth by spreading out evenly?
2010-11-18T14:03:35  <lavalamp_> well, I guess it would just change distance calculations
2010-11-18T14:03:55  <McLeopold> move planets would be awesome
2010-11-18T14:04:20  <McLeopold> hop a ride on an orbiter and swing into the enemy base and reck havok
2010-11-18T14:05:03  <lavalamp_> how about you can destroy growthrate*10 ships on a planet to get +1 to the growthrate...
2010-11-18T14:05:13  <antimatroid> redirecting fleets would be interesting
2010-11-18T14:05:28  <antimatroid> although not sure you could do it with current dist calcs
2010-11-18T14:05:38  <antimatroid> actually you could, but it'd be messyish
2010-11-18T14:05:40  <JamesMG> redirecting fleets would cause havok, oh man
2010-11-18T14:05:53  <antimatroid> the holy grail of mess*
2010-11-18T14:07:10  <antimatroid> actually, you'd just pick your optimal ship accumulation points
2010-11-18T14:07:16  <antimatroid> i don't think it'd be that much harder
2010-11-18T14:07:34  <antimatroid> you'd sort of be making your own dynamic 0 growth planets
2010-11-18T14:08:22  <antimatroid> i guess the best way is lots of 0 growth 0 ship neutrals
2010-11-18T14:08:30  <antimatroid> and fleets can battle "in mid air"

2010-11-18T14:12:26  <McLeopold> I liked the orbital method better.
2010-11-18T14:12:47  <McLeopold> for the cost of 1 ships, you could have prevented the enemy from taking a neutral
2010-11-18T14:12:59  <McLeopold> then taken it the next turn
2010-11-18T14:13:10  <McLeopold> slightly better than growth + 2

2010-11-18T14:17:21  <antimatroid> that had to be done
2010-11-18T14:17:31  <antimatroid> each option resulted in a completely different game

2010-11-18T14:19:08  <JamesMG> wow, expansion failure: http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=9428
2010-11-18T14:20:02  <lavalamp_> hey, you got three whole planets...
2010-11-18T14:20:11  <JamesMG> good ones too
2010-11-18T14:20:16  <JamesMG> better believe it
2010-11-18T14:27:10  <asbadrobot> it's interesting that bocsimacko has a huge point lead over everyone else in the top 10 :)
2010-11-18T14:28:42  <asbadrobot> by watching his games i get the feeling his strategy is rather different than everyone elses - some kind of advance planning  taking place there

2010-11-18T15:25:00  <d0ugal> github is my friend
2010-11-18T15:25:18  <lavalamp_> github doesn't do free private repos
2010-11-18T15:25:26  <Zannick> i can't hg push to github
2010-11-18T15:25:30  <Zannick> ;)
2010-11-18T15:25:30  <d0ugal> True that
2010-11-18T15:25:41  <d0ugal> I was paying for them already though
2010-11-18T15:26:07  <lavalamp_> TortoiseHG is really nice-- though I do recommend using the commandline for a while just so you know it
2010-11-18T15:26:10  <d0ugal> Zannick: You can svn commit though
2010-11-18T15:26:28  <lavalamp_> another strike against it ;)
2010-11-18T15:26:30  <Zannick> that's a poor alternative
2010-11-18T15:26:50  <McLeopold> I'm using the eclipse plugin
2010-11-18T15:27:29  <lavalamp_> ah never tried that
2010-11-18T15:27:52  <d0ugal> Indeed, I prefer github just cause its got more of a following I suppose
2010-11-18T15:27:55  <d0ugal> and its hardly expensive
2010-11-18T15:28:19  <d0ugal> but anyways..
2010-11-18T15:28:32  <d0ugal> So on the tcp server, what are the two numbers on the planet? I feel like I'm missing something?
2010-11-18T15:29:13  <lavalamp_> id+growth?
2010-11-18T15:29:33  <d0ugal> Oh, ID, duh. :)
2010-11-18T15:29:48  <lavalamp_> yeah... that thing that is really nice to know when debugging

2010-11-18T17:07:18  <McLeopold> so my feature to show the latest game was actually showing the first game
2010-11-18T17:08:50  <McLeopold> take off the ()
2010-11-18T17:08:53  <lavalamp_> tim__: guess: it's not a function, lose the () after it?
2010-11-18T17:09:20  <McLeopold> wait...
2010-11-18T17:09:32  <McLeopold> No it is a function that should return a list.
2010-11-18T17:09:47  <lavalamp_> I don't know python or the python starter package
2010-11-18T17:09:50  <McLeopold> tim__: pastebin your code

2010-11-18T17:11:32  <McLeopold> medrimonia: was the timeout due to your code, or a bad connection to the server?
2010-11-18T17:11:48  <McLeopold> its a decorator
2010-11-18T17:12:35  <McLeopold> hmm, the starter package changed alot since I downloaded it

2010-11-18T17:15:47  <McLeopold> looks like you'll need some logging

2010-11-18T17:19:04  <iamluck|2> logging will be great, and you should do it, but also try this: run your bot, and paste contents of the map into it, and type in go... you should see the error your bot makes, I think.
2010-11-18T17:24:57  <tim__> found some problems. thanks for the logging tip :)

2010-11-18T18:36:00  <Zannick> no, but i would think that's the effect
2010-11-18T18:36:14  <mega1> I found one
2010-11-18T18:36:19  <janzert> sorry, that was in response to mega1
2010-11-18T18:36:24  <mega1> a1k0n submitted on sep 11
2010-11-18T18:36:38  <janzert> Zannick: to what you said, yes
2010-11-18T18:36:43  <mega1> he was on the top for some days
2010-11-18T18:36:52  <Zannick> janzert: ah
2010-11-18T18:37:23  <mega1> now that's worth 2563 elo and rank 611
2010-11-18T18:38:30  <janzert> mega1: wow
2010-11-18T18:38:52  <Zannick> i'm pretty sure he has some better ones he hasn't submitted yet
2010-11-18T18:39:23  <mega1> I'm trying to assess how many contestants take it a bit seriously
2010-11-18T18:39:41  <mega1> Zannick: I think he has not the time
2010-11-18T18:40:01  <Zannick> between sept 11 and midoctober i thought he was working on it
2010-11-18T18:40:09  <davidjliu> there's also kcm1700, who was #1 for a long while
2010-11-18T18:40:20  <mega1> where is he now?
2010-11-18T18:40:22  <Zannick> i worked through oct 30 and my bot is floundering around 600-700s
2010-11-18T18:40:27  <davidjliu> now he's 141

2010-11-18T18:43:16  <sigh> then it was McLeopold (who's bot is still the same)
2010-11-18T18:43:29  <sigh> *official bot
2010-11-18T18:44:18  <sigh> then people started knocking down McLeopold until dmj came to the top... kcm got #1 in that period

2010-11-18T18:49:28  <McLeopold> I will be dissapointing it think.
2010-11-18T18:49:38  <sigh> McLeopold: because you won't beat meag1? :P
