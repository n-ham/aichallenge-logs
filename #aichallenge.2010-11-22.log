2010-11-22T00:00:50  <antimatroid> meh, people should just have a cup of concrete
2010-11-22T00:00:52  <burny> it requires basically no effort to do.. and doesn't hurt anyone who is entering the 'contest proper'
2010-11-22T00:01:33  <virdo> does it? are there any FPSes that do that? I know SC2 has leagues, and if you're in the top X of the league you can expect to be put into better league.... don't think it's needed in this case :)

2010-11-22T00:03:20  <burny> virdo.. I can easily see lots of people, taking the default bot.. making a small change.. seeing it in teh bottom 20%, thinking about it for an hour or two, and giving up
2010-11-22T00:03:43  <burny> if there was a bit of a stepping stone, as they worked on their bots.. it'd be much easier to enter
2010-11-22T00:06:53  <burny> like, I'm sure EVERY bot has "what is the best lanet to attack right now?" as part of it's logic
2010-11-22T00:08:24  <burny> I guess, it would really be no different than teh already proposed, allowing custom groups/ladders
2010-11-22T00:08:59  <burny> except, to have a couple specific ones, that slightly modify the rules of the game
2010-11-22T00:14:15  <antimatroid> i consider taking many planets at each node
2010-11-22T00:14:20  <antimatroid> not just "the best one now"
2010-11-22T00:18:23  <burny> so you just have a yes/no.. no metric atlal on which one is best?

2010-11-22T00:25:23  <foucist> burny: how about a contest that prevents all programmers from entering, only allowing computer scientists to enter?  and also, no heuristics allowed, the standard AI techniques must be used

2010-11-22T00:30:49  <antimatroid> or more players per map
2010-11-22T00:30:50  <burny> ya, per map board could be cool too
2010-11-22T00:31:14  <McLeopold_> I'll get a per map ranking on zeroviz later

2010-11-22T00:32:15  <antimatroid> once to handle huge distances and plant numbers, another to handle multiple players
2010-11-22T00:32:19  <antimatroid> one*
2010-11-22T00:32:31  <McLeopold_> nice, zeroviz will support you
2010-11-22T00:32:54  <McLeopold_> far_crazy will have large distance
2010-11-22T00:33:08  <antimatroid> hundreds of planets too please :)
2010-11-22T00:33:16  <McLeopold_> crazy_dense
2010-11-22T00:34:05  <McLeopold_> you've played crazy_fast maps, right?
2010-11-22T00:34:05  <antimatroid> i'll try to do a minimax revision for small n-player maps
2010-11-22T00:34:13  <antimatroid> yeah, but it was with a very partial bot
2010-11-22T00:34:19  <antimatroid> and against like you and bocsimacko
2010-11-22T00:34:22  <antimatroid> so it got pantsed
2010-11-22T00:34:34  <antimatroid> it wasn't even expanding :P
2010-11-22T00:34:41  <antimatroid> not that that mattered on some maps
2010-11-22T00:34:46  <McLeopold_> oh, yeah, one planet at a time bot
2010-11-22T00:34:54  <antimatroid> hehe
2010-11-22T00:35:12  <antimatroid> and it was really bad at going for planets on the edges of the map :|
2010-11-22T00:35:29  <antimatroid> i've checked and rechecked the ordering or planets

2010-11-22T01:29:21  <antimatroid> mega1: will you take the time to make a couple of revisions of your bot? mainly to handle huge numbers of planets/distances and another for n players?
2010-11-22T01:29:41  <antimatroid> i don't expect to spend long on it, but it'd be cool to see some games of the sort
2010-11-22T01:29:49  <mega1> n players is a rewrite
2010-11-22T01:30:04  <antimatroid> hmm, i think i could get it working semi intelligably in a day or so
2010-11-22T01:30:13  <antimatroid> one could spend ages on it of course
2010-11-22T01:30:15  <mega1> huge number of planets only needs some optimization for the O(N^2) parts
2010-11-22T01:30:18  <McLeopold_> I suspect n players will shut down a lot of bots into turtle mode.
2010-11-22T01:30:34  <burny> n players is a TOTALLY different problem than 2players
2010-11-22T01:30:42  <antimatroid> burny: yes, it's just for fun
2010-11-22T01:30:53  <burny> but it's like..
2010-11-22T01:30:58  <burny> now that you have your checkers AI..
2010-11-22T01:31:06  <mega1> huge distances? hmm, that's easier maybe
2010-11-22T01:31:07  <burny> change a couple lines, and enter it into this chess competition
2010-11-22T01:31:34  <antimatroid> mega1: depends, i sort of have states of noPlanets*(maxDist+2)
2010-11-22T01:31:45  <antimatroid> so either of those numbers blowing out hurts me
2010-11-22T01:31:50  <McLeopold_> what was that game name again?
2010-11-22T01:31:54  <McLeopold_> atrima?
2010-11-22T01:31:57  <antimatroid> arimaa
2010-11-22T01:32:29  <antimatroid> janzert said he's planning to get back to work on it once this is over
2010-11-22T01:32:47  <antimatroid> one would need to do a lot of training trying out different starting positions i think
2010-11-22T01:35:08  <McLeopold_> I think pong would be fun.
2010-11-22T01:35:35  <antimatroid> it'd be hard to watch and have it not be trivial
2010-11-22T01:35:47  <antimatroid> i guess you can slow it right down
2010-11-22T01:36:14  <McLeopold_> well, basic pong might not be fun, but it is pretty easy to add faucets to the game

2010-11-22T01:36:56  <McLeopold_> I think the only hard part would be making sure different languages can calculate the same.
2010-11-22T01:37:04  <McLeopold_> rounding errors might be an issue

2010-11-22T01:37:56  <McLeopold_> yep, that's the one
2010-11-22T01:38:37  <McLeopold_> if you had an obstacle half way, you could hit it and keep some balls on your side, then try to overwhelm the opponenet.
2010-11-22T01:38:55  <McLeopold_> try and place one in each corner at the same time

2010-11-22T01:44:38  <antimatroid> you can ace your way through most of the first 3 levels if you put enough spin on it

2010-11-22T01:47:33  <antimatroid> it gets really hard by then

2010-11-22T02:51:05  <burny> how? both crash on frame1?
2010-11-22T02:51:25  <janzert> they are almost certainly pretty much all the starter package exactly

2010-11-22T02:51:35  <Mistmanov> I think the crashers are the high peak that goes to 90%
2010-11-22T02:51:49  <burny> doesn't the starter almost never draw?
2010-11-22T02:51:54  <McLeopold_> well, it would be nice if I had one, maybe not need
2010-11-22T02:51:56  <janzert> McLeopold_: ? it's the full list
2010-11-22T02:52:03  <Mistmanov> yeah, starter is assymetrical, so shouldn't draw I think
2010-11-22T02:52:09  <McLeopold_> yeah, but what rank is the 2000 elo line at?
2010-11-22T02:52:22  <janzert> Mistmanov: yeah, that draw peak at the end are the crashers
2010-11-22T02:52:29  <burny> 2000 elo is around 1200rank
2010-11-22T02:52:43  <burny> 2200elo is 900ish rank
2010-11-22T02:53:06  <burny> 1584rank is rage bot?
2010-11-22T02:53:09  <McLeopold_> actually, I think percent on the right would be percent of participants?
2010-11-22T02:53:11  <janzert> the bottom has it but could certainly be done better, this is just pretty much the default chart from openoffice calc
2010-11-22T02:53:29  <janzert> McLeopold_: no, right y axis is draw percentage
2010-11-22T02:53:40  <McLeopold_> oh
2010-11-22T02:53:47  <janzert> left y axis is elo
2010-11-22T02:53:52  <McLeopold_> bottom is?
2010-11-22T02:53:56  <janzert> rank
2010-11-22T02:54:04  <McLeopold_> got it
2010-11-22T02:54:43  <burny> whatever is rank 2900-4100.. if you remove those, the elo has a nice curve
2010-11-22T02:55:18  <McLeopold_> did that graph change with the new maps?
2010-11-22T02:55:32  <McLeopold_> I wonder how many current submissions broke?
2010-11-22T02:55:39  <janzert> burny: yeah, the all the people that just submit a starter package and nothing else leave quite a plateau
2010-11-22T02:55:59  <burny> I don't think the starter has a 25% tie ratio
2010-11-22T02:56:09  <janzert> McLeopold_: no, idea this is the first time I've generated it
2010-11-22T02:56:10  <burny> of the 20 or so games I saw of mine, none were a tie
2010-11-22T02:56:15  <McLeopold_> Rage bot should always draw RageBog?
2010-11-22T02:56:17  <McLeopold_> bot
2010-11-22T02:56:32  <janzert> burny: only when playing against other starter packages pretty much
2010-11-22T02:56:51  <janzert> McLeopold_: I think that is the peak around 1500 maybe?
2010-11-22T02:56:59  <burny> I think the starter is rank 2200-2400
2010-11-22T02:57:12  <burny> or.. do different language starter's have different logic?
2010-11-22T02:57:12  <McLeopold_> ragebo is 1500? o_O
2010-11-22T02:57:24  <janzert> burny: go look at the 3000-4000 games they sure look like starter package games
2010-11-22T02:57:27  <burny> 1584ish is my guess on ragebot
2010-11-22T02:57:46  <janzert> at least the couple I looked at
2010-11-22T02:57:47  <McLeopold_> I think the small spike at the top is significant
2010-11-22T02:58:05  <McLeopold_> It would be cool to see a 200 game percentage too.
2010-11-22T02:58:05  <burny> I agree leo..
2010-11-22T02:58:13  <janzert> yeah it is rather interesting
2010-11-22T02:58:22  <burny> I think that the more the bots get to be 'good'..
2010-11-22T02:58:31  <burny> the more they'll tie on all maps, always
2010-11-22T02:58:44  <McLeopold_> Perhaps it is maps that have obvious build fast a wait strategies.
2010-11-22T02:58:59  <janzert> burny: depends on how many rock-paper-scissors scenarios exist on them
2010-11-22T02:58:59  <McLeopold_> http://tcp.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=19966
2010-11-22T02:59:16  <McLeopold_> assuming I built fast. :)
2010-11-22T02:59:24  <janzert> :)

2010-11-22T02:59:58  <McLeopold_> But, that type of map is likely to draw a lot against good bots.
2010-11-22T03:00:11  <McLeopold_> (And should totally be kept in the contest.)
2010-11-22T03:00:41  <burny> ya, as long as there isn't lots of that type

2010-11-22T03:01:44  <burny> how about top10?
2010-11-22T03:01:53  <McLeopold_> does that flat spot make it tough to move up if your in there?

2010-11-22T03:02:04  <burny> since top100 has a pretty huge range of goodness
2010-11-22T03:02:21  <burny> leo, 'tough' no.. just slow
2010-11-22T03:02:26  <burny> takes like 10 games to get through it
2010-11-22T03:02:32  <McLeopold_> http://tcp.zeroviz.us/map_r538_39.txt.html
2010-11-22T03:02:37  <janzert> burny: no idea and it wouldn't be that many games to draw much of a conclusion from anyway
2010-11-22T03:03:37  <McLeopold_> same map:  http://tcp.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=20089
2010-11-22T03:04:40  <burny> I'm almost thinking that instead of taking the effort to do a proper bot..
2010-11-22T03:04:41  <McLeopold_> even though it draws a lot, there is plenty of room for strategy in that map
2010-11-22T03:04:52  <burny> I want to just tweak, and see how high I can get a gimpy simple bot
2010-11-22T03:05:03  <janzert> another one that ties it is map_r538_44
2010-11-22T03:05:35  <McLeopold_> not on my server
2010-11-22T03:05:50  <janzert> and there are a couple more that I'm sure don't have a statisically significant difference
2010-11-22T03:06:06  <janzert> this map http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8292400
2010-11-22T03:06:17  <burny> I wonder if I can break the top 100, with a gimpy bot
2010-11-22T03:06:21  <janzert> ahh, very close start
2010-11-22T03:06:55  <McLeopold_> that 4 in the middle is just waiting to get sniped
2010-11-22T03:06:58  <janzert> although that central 4 neutral may make it an r-p-s starting situation?
2010-11-22T03:07:18  <burny> probably not possible to get into top100, without making the bot consider what the opponent is doing(ie. defend against attacks)
2010-11-22T03:07:32  <janzert> burny: yeah, probably not anymore
2010-11-22T03:07:40  <McLeopold_> defending against attacks doesn't really predict the opponent
2010-11-22T03:07:56  <McLeopold_> it's more of a reaction
2010-11-22T03:07:57  <burny> leo, if I have 13 ships at a 5grow planet..
2010-11-22T03:08:04  <burny> and the opponent sends 65ships at it..
2010-11-22T03:08:21  <burny> my current bot waits until it's captured 10turns later, and then sends 65ships at it
2010-11-22T03:08:25  <janzert> McLeopold_: I think he simply means predicting future states
2010-11-22T03:08:40  <McLeopold_> oh
2010-11-22T03:09:43  <burny> and if after sending those 65.. the opponent sends 5.. I don't care about those 5, until 10turns later
2010-11-22T03:09:44  <burny> etc.
2010-11-22T03:10:35  <McLeopold_> yeah, I don't think you'll go very high without future planet states
2010-11-22T03:10:52  <burny> at 2100ish elo
2010-11-22T03:11:14  <burny> can get to 2500ish I'm sure
2010-11-22T03:11:23  <burny> but higher then that, I duno
2010-11-22T03:11:50  <antimatroid> it's not very hard to implement future states
2010-11-22T03:12:15  <burny> it is compared to what I have
2010-11-22T03:12:56  <burny> :P
2010-11-22T03:13:27  <McLeopold_> My first bot didn't have future states.

2010-11-22T03:23:05  <McLeopold_> you are playing on the crazy maps
2010-11-22T03:23:25  <antimatroid> it shouldn't crash

2010-11-22T03:24:14  <antimatroid> i must have screwed something up
2010-11-22T03:24:17  <antimatroid> hopefully it is just from that
2010-11-22T03:25:00  <McLeopold_> yeah, if map is to go forward, the old bot rocked
2010-11-22T03:25:03  <antimatroid> right, i'm going to work out what's causing that
2010-11-22T03:27:22  <antimatroid> bah, that time it crashed :|
2010-11-22T03:27:25  <antimatroid> this isn't good

2010-11-22T03:38:10  <antimatroid> bah it crashed again
2010-11-22T03:40:17  <antimatroid> it needs redistribution desperately
2010-11-22T03:40:48  <McLeopold_> you should be able to just drop in a funneling system
2010-11-22T03:41:00  <antimatroid> i already have the strategy worked out
2010-11-22T03:41:03  <antimatroid> i'm just not rushing things :)
2010-11-22T03:43:22  <antimatroid> is that your really old submit bot?
2010-11-22T03:46:38  <antimatroid> it's making some silly moves
2010-11-22T03:55:13  <McLeopold_> I got a math question
2010-11-22T03:55:26  <antimatroid> ...
2010-11-22T03:55:28  <McLeopold_> let's say you have a growth 4 planet with 4 ships right in the middle
2010-11-22T03:55:33  <McLeopold_> what do you do?
2010-11-22T03:55:56  <antimatroid> it depends how close you are to them
2010-11-22T03:56:01  <antimatroid> and what other options are available
2010-11-22T03:56:04  <McLeopold_> if you both go for it, and the enemy sends more, you lose 4 ships for nothing
2010-11-22T03:56:15  <McLeopold_> assume it's the best thing going
2010-11-22T03:56:30  <antimatroid> send everything that doesn't leave your other planets vulnerable
2010-11-22T03:56:32  <McLeopold_> distance 6
2010-11-22T03:57:07  <antimatroid> although, it could be the case that then you lose if they send everything and you don't have enough left to claim their other planets
2010-11-22T03:57:08  <McLeopold_> okay, assume there are a few other things out there, send everything that is left?
2010-11-22T03:57:13  <antimatroid> it really can change depending on the situation
2010-11-22T03:58:50  <McLeopold_> by bot is having a hard time figuring this out

2010-11-22T03:59:57  <McLeopold_> You have to assume the opponent moves like you, right?
2010-11-22T04:00:21  <antimatroid> yeah, although i don't consider them expanding
2010-11-22T04:00:45  <antimatroid> at each node, i pick moves for the player,  also adding the zero move, then make children for each of those
2010-11-22T04:01:13  <antimatroid> generate the tree for 0.9 seconds, then evaluate the terminal nodes and use minimax to pick the best string of strategies
2010-11-22T04:01:17  <antimatroid> then implement those
2010-11-22T04:01:18  <McLeopold_> I could probably do with some prediction
2010-11-22T04:01:39  <McLeopold_> I could stick the moves in, and my framework handles it, I've just never tried it.
2010-11-22T04:02:00  <McLeopold_> It might help with first turn decisions
2010-11-22T04:02:18  <antimatroid> yeah, but it's hard to have them expand
2010-11-22T04:02:19  <McLeopold_> But, so far, it seems a little better to just react.
2010-11-22T04:02:23  <antimatroid> but not try to snipe their "mock moves"

2010-11-22T04:02:54  <antimatroid> so i just don't have them expanding at all, only defending/attacking
2010-11-22T04:02:59  <mega1> janzert: so much for neutrality :-)
2010-11-22T04:03:53  <janzert> heh, gotta give out something for getting into the top 10 ;)
2010-11-22T04:04:11  <McLeopold_> mega1: you wanna chime in on the unsnipable planet delima?
2010-11-22T04:04:28  <mega1> sure
2010-11-22T04:04:36  <mega1> where is it?
2010-11-22T04:04:48  <antimatroid> centre planet, 4 growth and 4 ships
2010-11-22T04:05:11  <McLeopold_> http://tcp.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=19946
2010-11-22T04:05:16  <antimatroid> that's not general enough for an exact strategy, but dependent on your own given situations with that, what do you do?
2010-11-22T04:05:33  <McLeopold_> mega1: baits the opponent...

2010-11-22T04:06:31  <McLeopold_> mega1 also doesn't worry about his home planet safty
2010-11-22T04:06:31  <antimatroid> how did you decide to do that third turn and not second?
2010-11-22T04:06:44  <McLeopold_> I know
2010-11-22T04:06:50  <antimatroid> nevermind, fleet is invisible
2010-11-22T04:06:51  <McLeopold_> turn 1, wait for dominance in the area
2010-11-22T04:07:02  <McLeopold_> turn 2, send enough to take the planet
2010-11-22T04:07:06  <antimatroid> he sends 5 second turn, that was dangerous ?
2010-11-22T04:07:12  <mega1> I'm still trying to digest it
2010-11-22T04:07:14  <antimatroid> what if error send 6?
2010-11-22T04:07:17  <McLeopold_> turn 3, assume enemy will send as well and jump?
2010-11-22T04:07:32  <antimatroid> what happens if error sent 6 there on the second turn
2010-11-22T04:07:49  <antimatroid> his home planet might then be vulnerable, i think he'd still be snipable?
2010-11-22T04:08:06  <McLeopold_> http://tcp.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=12157
2010-11-22T04:08:30  <McLeopold_> without dominance, mega1 just goes for it turn 2?
2010-11-22T04:08:46  <McLeopold_> oh, wait, he sniped
2010-11-22T04:09:00  <McLeopold_> and switched
2010-11-22T04:09:09  <antimatroid> yeah, you went for it
2010-11-22T04:09:24  <antimatroid> the optimal strategy there is to wait i'm pretty sure
2010-11-22T04:09:26  <mega1> in the first there is nothing that can be taken over without losing that 4
2010-11-22T04:09:55  <McLeopold_> what about the 98? not important to you :)
2010-11-22T04:10:24  <antimatroid> wait, if you send 5 on the first turn and they wait, isn't it kind of rps?
2010-11-22T04:10:42  <McLeopold_> nope, look what happens
2010-11-22T04:10:54  <antimatroid> not if you back up your claim and they try to snipe
2010-11-22T04:11:05  <McLeopold_> I get back to even next turn, but I lose 4 growth after that every turn
2010-11-22T04:11:12  <McLeopold_> Even with trying to go for the home planet
2010-11-22T04:11:23  <antimatroid> you send nothing to 4 neutral on the second turn
2010-11-22T04:11:31  <antimatroid> you could have saved his snipe
2010-11-22T04:11:39  <antimatroid> that's the point of it being ships <= growth
2010-11-22T04:11:54  <antimatroid> but he might have predicted you would do that and send at your home planet
2010-11-22T04:12:03  <McLeopold_> yeah, but how do you know to do that generically?
2010-11-22T04:12:09  <McLeopold_> on this map, sure
2010-11-22T04:12:37  <antimatroid> i think you can take that 4 then have a very undecided match on your hands
2010-11-22T04:13:00  <antimatroid> mega1: what do you think?
2010-11-22T04:13:23  <mega1> I think so too
2010-11-22T04:14:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold_: the answer is there is no immediate way to handle your given condition, it's too general

2010-11-22T04:16:00  <antimatroid> it's the simple 2 player 2 planet isosceles triangle example, which is far from trivial in itself

2010-11-22T04:16:29  <antimatroid> that is another type of map i would like to do, randomly made 3 planet maps
2010-11-22T04:16:49  <McLeopold_> it seems like jumping is the way to go
2010-11-22T04:17:29  <antimatroid> if you placed all planets equally spaced around a circle, the game would look cool

2010-11-22T09:29:36  <bhasker> morning
2010-11-22T09:31:09  <Error323> howdy
2010-11-22T09:31:42  <bhasker> i still can't figure out how to calculate available ships correctly so freaking annoying
2010-11-22T09:31:59  <bhasker> i hate it when my bot won't defend a planet from a nearby planet with lots of ships
2010-11-22T09:32:21  <bhasker> grrr
2010-11-22T09:32:57  <antimatroid1> that's the last major thing i need to add, then it's all tuning
2010-11-22T09:33:33  <Accoun> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzpByR3MvI
2010-11-22T09:33:33  <bhasker> how are you calculating available ships
2010-11-22T09:33:37  <bhasker> i have tried various models
2010-11-22T09:33:40  <bhasker> none of them work well
2010-11-22T09:34:15  <antimatroid1> i take it you're accounting for incoming fleets already?
2010-11-22T09:34:19  <bhasker> yes
2010-11-22T09:34:26  <bhasker> the problem is when there is nothing incoming
2010-11-22T09:34:32  <bhasker> what is a good number you can safely send out
2010-11-22T09:34:51  <bhasker> so the nearby planet will have ships, and no incoming
2010-11-22T09:34:57  <antimatroid1> then my other hack is to have them mock send their ships to the closest planets draining away their usable ships, then picking moves, then resetting the moves they mock made
2010-11-22T09:34:59  <bhasker> but the way i calculate available ships probably locks it down
2010-11-22T09:35:07  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-22T09:35:28  <antimatroid1> i tried a big thing where i'd try to make "all planets safe" like that, but it ended up just crippling it
2010-11-22T09:35:34  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-22T09:35:55  <bhasker> if i assume everything is available unless under attack it ends up redirecting ships from front line planets
2010-11-22T09:35:56  <antimatroid1> i suspect i'll probably only mock send the fleets they have at time 0 or the first few turns too
2010-11-22T09:36:09  <bhasker> i tried that didnt work very well
2010-11-22T09:36:20  <antimatroid1> it used to work alright for me
2010-11-22T09:36:24  <antimatroid1> i hope it still does
2010-11-22T09:36:50  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-22T09:39:55  <Error323> damnit tcp is sooo damn random

2010-11-22T11:35:35  <TEAM_AI> can anyone tell how to i can implement bot-logging in c++ ?
2010-11-22T11:35:46  <antimatroid1> ofstreams
2010-11-22T11:38:15  <TEAM_AI> it won't cause errs?
2010-11-22T11:38:27  <antimatroid1> you can't submit it with that
2010-11-22T11:39:39  <TEAM_AI> it's terrible that cout or similar doesnt work ^^
2010-11-22T11:39:54  <antimatroid1> that's how you communicate with the engine
2010-11-22T11:41:22  <Error323> just make a logger class, create an instance in main and refer to it throughout ur project with a macro
2010-11-22T11:42:08  <TEAM_AI> and then i can send strings to console at PlayGame?
2010-11-22T11:42:50  <TEAM_AI> or is it better to use files?
2010-11-22T11:43:12  <Mistmanov> no idea whether it's handy or anything, but I do all my logging via cerr
2010-11-22T11:43:43  <Mistmanov> and then cygwin sends the cerr thingie to file
2010-11-22T11:44:42  <TEAM_AI> hm, damn ms vs ^^ is it possible to use windows msgboxes?
2010-11-22T11:47:03  <TEAM_AI> and one important q: timlimit per round is 1 sec how fast are the challange machines?

2010-11-22T11:59:58  <Mistmanov> I don't know whether that info is available yet. The current servers that are running the contests handle something like 10 games per second each.
2010-11-22T12:00:17  <Mistmanov> (there is a page hidden somewhere on the website showing the stats, but I can't find it -_-)
2010-11-22T12:00:23  <McLeopold> @gamestats
2010-11-22T12:00:24  <contestbot> McLeopold: gamestats = http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-11-22T12:00:28  <antimatroid1> the servers running now are the ones that will be used
2010-11-22T12:00:48  <antimatroid1> google doens't really have a whole lot to do with the contest
2010-11-22T12:00:58  <antimatroid1> their names on it and they provided some money this time
2010-11-22T12:00:58  <Mistmanov> ah ok. That's massively faster than your average home pc I guess?
2010-11-22T12:01:05  <Mistmanov> Mine certainly can't handle 20 games per second
2010-11-22T12:01:13  <Mistmanov> oh per minute
2010-11-22T12:01:18  <Mistmanov> nvm reading the charts wrong -_-
2010-11-22T12:01:27  <antimatroid1> it depends which bots are playing
2010-11-22T12:01:30  <McLeopold> It could probably handle 20 RageBot games per minutes.
2010-11-22T12:01:41  <Mistmanov> yeah per minute is ok
2010-11-22T12:01:44  <Mistmanov> was reading it wrong
2010-11-22T12:01:50  <Mistmanov> my pc does about 1 game per 2-3 seconds
2010-11-22T12:01:58  <Mistmanov> (crappy bot :p)
2010-11-22T12:02:06  <TEAM_AI> i hope it is fast i need much operatin power :D
2010-11-22T12:02:07  <McLeopold> I need to improve my codes speed, apparently.
2010-11-22T12:02:32  <TEAM_AI> but i hope i dont have to use assembler ^^
2010-11-22T12:04:35  <JamesMG> what are you doing that requires so much time per turn?
2010-11-22T12:04:42  <TEAM_AI> does the contest have a deeper sense
2010-11-22T12:04:55  <antimatroid1> i'm beginning to have doubts about my current method of making the game tree
2010-11-22T12:04:58  <JamesMG> yes, this is Ender's Game except in real life
2010-11-22T12:05:00  <McLeopold> predicting future states of all planets after every potential fleet order
2010-11-22T12:05:03  <TEAM_AI> calculating turns in future
2010-11-22T12:05:04  <antimatroid1> it has its benefits and problems
2010-11-22T12:05:15  <McLeopold> and after revoke orders
2010-11-22T12:05:16  <TEAM_AI> like chess
2010-11-22T12:05:39  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: i think our code would be quite similar
2010-11-22T12:05:44  <antimatroid1> i expect most peoples will be
2010-11-22T12:05:58  <McLeopold> I think my code is similar to almost everyones.  Whoever has the best bugs wins. :)
2010-11-22T12:06:06  <TEAM_AI> very true
2010-11-22T12:06:09  <TEAM_AI> ^^
2010-11-22T12:06:47  <McLeopold> I had to run cProfile to find out why it was so slow.
2010-11-22T12:06:54  <McLeopold> String parsing was 75% of it.
2010-11-22T12:07:10  <McLeopold> When I take out the logging, I'll be alot faster.
2010-11-22T12:07:10  <JamesMG> parsing the game state?
2010-11-22T12:07:38  <antimatroid1> i took out all the tokenize crap in the c++ starter package
2010-11-22T12:08:02  <Error323> whois "testing" on tcp?
2010-11-22T12:08:03  <antimatroid1> i'm just inputting straight to a string stream and throwing out any comments
2010-11-22T12:08:08  <Error323> cuz omg that game is taking loooooooooooong
2010-11-22T12:08:08  <antimatroid1> error323: me
2010-11-22T12:08:10  <McLeopold> The second slowdown, in a 10 turn game, was about 39,000 calls to "how many ships do I have available"
2010-11-22T12:08:11  <antimatroid1> but it's broken
2010-11-22T12:08:19  <Error323> i see
2010-11-22T12:08:21  <McLeopold> So I added memoization
2010-11-22T12:08:34  <JamesMG> I'm almost wishing I hadn't used the starter package now
2010-11-22T12:08:50  <antimatroid1> my code has almost nothing from the starter package
2010-11-22T12:09:04  <JamesMG> I hung on to the starter Fleet and Planet objects for far too long
2010-11-22T12:09:16  <antimatroid1> Error323: did you like my terrible first move? :P
2010-11-22T12:09:25  <Error323> did see it
2010-11-22T12:09:26  <Error323> yet
2010-11-22T12:09:26  <McLeopold> Yeah, you don't need fleet objects
2010-11-22T12:09:30  <Error323> but fuck you won >_<

2010-11-22T12:10:45  <antimatroid1> the first move is an example of my doubts of my game tree
2010-11-22T12:11:00  <antimatroid1> what i think it's doing is making a move from me, having them attack it, then seeing their home planet as tackable
2010-11-22T12:11:06  <JamesMG> what's up with the pathing from 2 to 10 to 6?
2010-11-22T12:11:45  <Error323> hmmm but that's because its not good yet
2010-11-22T12:11:48  <Error323> damnit
2010-11-22T12:11:58  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I guess it didn't see that he would land on his planets and be able to send back reinforcements?
2010-11-22T12:12:09  <antimatroid1> JamesMG: my redistribution minimuses distance to it's redistribution planet and it's closest enemy
2010-11-22T12:12:26  <antimatroid1> i don't even have the opponent expanding
2010-11-22T12:12:34  <antimatroid1> it doesn't work the way i'm doing my game tree
2010-11-22T12:12:53  <antimatroid1> i'm not really sure how to pick moves out otherwise though, it's too hard to do combinations
2010-11-22T12:13:43  <antimatroid1> although i haven't got it calculating closest enemies as i plan to yet either
2010-11-22T12:13:48  <antimatroid1> there's still quite a bit to be added
2010-11-22T12:13:54  <antimatroid1> and there's something broken with the tree

2010-11-22T12:32:52  <bhasker_> for me
2010-11-22T12:33:02  <bhasker_> is to not route ships from a planet thats under attack
2010-11-22T12:33:12  <bhasker_> i meant not forward
2010-11-22T12:33:32  <bhasker_> so ships pile up at that planet till the attack stops flowing

2010-11-22T14:00:38  <lavalamp_> Accoun does not deal with poor opening moves: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1146433
2010-11-22T14:01:22  <lavalamp_> A lot of my wins are because I did something suboptimal that the other guy didn't expect :/
2010-11-22T14:05:12  <Mistmanov> if you win... was it a bad opening move ^o)
2010-11-22T14:06:33  <Mistmanov> I'm personally having a lot of trouble deciding what a "good" opening is. I almost always have worse expansion than my opponents

2010-11-22T14:22:35  <Mistmanov> someone is playing on 995 btw..
2010-11-22T14:22:45  <McLeopold> yeah, it's been active for a while
2010-11-22T14:22:52  <McLeopold> port 996 is crazy maps
2010-11-22T14:22:57  <JamesMG> ewww
2010-11-22T14:23:09  <McLeopold> okay, 2 for 2
2010-11-22T14:23:13  <McLeopold> Mistmanov?
2010-11-22T14:23:16  <JamesMG> that was my pseudo tree bot
2010-11-22T14:23:27  <Mistmanov> connected now I think
2010-11-22T14:24:09  <McLeopold> hmm... I have more bugs
2010-11-22T14:24:23  <McLeopold> but my opening was good enough
2010-11-22T14:25:10  <Mistmanov> my opening is really bad :(
2010-11-22T14:25:14  <Mistmanov> it alway is :(
2010-11-22T14:25:26  <McLeopold> JamesMG: go again
2010-11-22T14:26:50  <McLeopold> JamesMG?
2010-11-22T14:27:50  <Mistmanov> btw, do any of the crazy maps have more than 40 planets? if so, they would kill my bot
2010-11-22T14:27:57  <McLeopold> 41 :)
2010-11-22T14:28:04  <Mistmanov> seriously? -_-
2010-11-22T14:28:08  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-22T14:28:42  <McLeopold> how come the game looks different?
2010-11-22T14:28:48  <McLeopold> do you do random stuff?
2010-11-22T14:29:01  <McLeopold> maybe i did?
2010-11-22T14:29:03  <janzert> new maps in rotation
2010-11-22T14:29:09  <Mistmanov> I shouldn't
2010-11-22T14:29:11  <McLeopold> link?
2010-11-22T14:29:23  <McLeopold> so I can download to tcp
2010-11-22T14:29:37  <janzert> just in svn right now
2010-11-22T14:29:42  <McLeopold> one of us may have a planet id bias
2010-11-22T14:30:34  <Mistmanov> if 2 planets have the same "should I attack this" score, there will probably be a bias yes
2010-11-22T14:30:53  <Mistmanov> (sorting thing will then pick the one with the lowest ID ?)
2010-11-22T14:31:03  <McLeopold> It's probably mine too
2010-11-22T14:31:26  <McLeopold> that second game looked better for me
2010-11-22T14:31:37  <McLeopold> I'm going to stop the map7 stuff

2010-11-22T14:35:19  <Error323> why?
2010-11-22T14:36:01  <Mjothvitnir> so you can find more bugs, of course
2010-11-22T14:36:35  <McLeopold> New maps that are running on official
2010-11-22T14:36:41  <McLeopold> Not ones I generated

2010-11-22T14:40:50  <Ice_Harley> janzert, do we still have bug, when any player makes invalid move player #1 lose?
2010-11-22T14:41:56  <Error323> Are you guys experiencing timeouts?
2010-11-22T14:42:00  <Error323> or is this just local
2010-11-22T14:42:15  <janzert> Ice_Harley: no
2010-11-22T14:42:31  <janzert> Ice_Harley: it was only ever a visualizer reporting bug btw
2010-11-22T14:42:49  <janzert> the game was correctly credited in the profile game list and for ranking
2010-11-22T14:42:49  <Mistmanov> not getting any timeouts here on the tcp server..
2010-11-22T14:43:24  <Error323> damn
2010-11-22T14:43:31  <Error323> must be local then
2010-11-22T14:43:33  <Error323> :/
2010-11-22T14:43:33  <Ice_Harley> can i see invalid move i did?
2010-11-22T14:45:01  <janzert> it's not recorded, sorry
2010-11-22T14:45:14  <Ice_Harley> well, thanks for reply
2010-11-22T14:45:23  <Mistmanov> Ice_Harley: http://spz.nofate.com/planetwars/visualizer/ allows you to turn official games into a map, that you can then replay locally
2010-11-22T14:45:36  <Mistmanov> (assuming your game engine supports fleets.. not all of them do)
2010-11-22T14:45:49  <Mistmanov> handy for exactly this situation =)
2010-11-22T14:46:11  <Ice_Harley> i did reply that game locally. I even did bot, that make moves like my opponent, but i can't reproduce that invalid order )
2010-11-22T14:46:47  <Mistmanov> ow ok
2010-11-22T14:47:03  <McLeopold> I don't think the invalid order makes it to the game state recorded.
2010-11-22T14:47:29  <Mistmanov> MceLeopold: ?
2010-11-22T14:47:43  <Mjothvitnir> game state is "preturn" error is "inturn"
2010-11-22T14:48:01  <Ice_Harley> i understand
2010-11-22T14:48:05  <Mistmanov> ah ok, but if you feed your bot the game state of preturn
2010-11-22T14:48:13  <Mistmanov> it should then produce the error right?
2010-11-22T14:48:23  <Ice_Harley> right, but it doesn't
2010-11-22T14:48:28  <Mjothvitnir> then it must make the same decision to produce the move that casues the error
2010-11-22T14:49:12  <Mjothvitnir> move that causes the error would be in the next "game state"
2010-11-22T14:49:25  <Error323> goddamnit, I keep getting timeouts >_< :( :( :(
2010-11-22T14:49:44  <janzert> McLeopold: did you happen to run your statistic gathering script over the new set yet?
2010-11-22T14:49:57  <Error323> ping to google is 10 ms on average :/
2010-11-22T14:50:00  <Error323> how is this possible
2010-11-22T14:50:10  <McLeopold> no, at it doesn't really do much yet

2010-11-22T14:51:23  <Ice_Harley> Mjothvitnir, http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8326847. This is strange game even because I was 6th, when i played it and my opponent was 2200. Why we play together? :) And then that invalid order...
2010-11-22T14:51:49  <janzert> yeah I'm just curious because the sampling of maps I looked at from the set looks like we may run toward the high end of planet number in this set
2010-11-22T14:51:51  <McLeopold> ouch, that's got to hurt the elo
2010-11-22T14:52:10  <McLeopold> my script will look at that, let me check
2010-11-22T14:52:21  <janzert> but that's after only looking at a fairly small sample so far
2010-11-22T14:52:37  <McLeopold> later...

2010-11-22T15:35:57  <McLeopold> hold on
2010-11-22T15:36:06  <janzert> ahh, ok
2010-11-22T15:36:13  <McLeopold> you and your stupid zero padding...
2010-11-22T15:36:23  <janzert> heh, sorry
2010-11-22T15:36:46  <janzert> it makes them sort nicer in lexicographic sorts though :)
2010-11-22T15:37:13  <McLeopold> okay, second set:
2010-11-22T15:37:14  <McLeopold>      count: 22.15
2010-11-22T15:37:15  <McLeopold>     growth: 71.45
2010-11-22T15:37:15  <McLeopold>   snipable:  0.53
2010-11-22T15:37:41  <McLeopold> snipable really should be "unsnipable", which means growth >= num_ships
2010-11-22T15:38:11  <McLeopold> and I'm not doing stdev yet
2010-11-22T15:38:49  <lavalamp_> Hmm appears my home internet connection went down
2010-11-22T15:39:40  <janzert> McLeopold: I was going to ask about snipable... so 0.53% of planets are unsnipable or?
2010-11-22T15:39:43  *** choas <choas!~lars@p578F67E9.dip.t-dialin.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-22T15:39:55  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-22T15:40:15  <McLeopold> or, there is an average of 1 planet every other map that is unsnipable
2010-11-22T15:40:16  <Error323>  McLeopold how is snipable defined?
2010-11-22T15:40:26  <McLeopold> ^^ growth >= num_ships
2010-11-22T15:40:52  <McLeopold> I only tossed that in there so I could find maps I wanted to test on.
2010-11-22T15:41:23  <McLeopold> sense most planets come in pairs, it is more like every 4th map has 2
2010-11-22T15:41:30  <janzert> any so actually we still ended up just under what should be the long term average for planets per map
2010-11-22T15:41:31  <McLeopold> since
2010-11-22T15:42:02  <McLeopold> 22.5?
2010-11-22T15:42:18  <McLeopold> there is the check for an odd number of planets

2010-11-22T15:42:37  <McLeopold> the even numbers are at the top
2010-11-22T15:42:40  <McLeopold> 15-30
2010-11-22T15:42:50  <McLeopold> so I would expect it to drop to 21.5
2010-11-22T15:43:09  <janzert> hmm, yeah for radial maps anyway

2010-11-22T15:43:27  <janzert> or is it both types
2010-11-22T15:43:32  <janzert> I guess it is
2010-11-22T15:43:33  <McLeopold> just radial
2010-11-22T15:43:58  <McLeopold> but line will still have it's fair share of odd planet maps
2010-11-22T15:43:59  <Mjothvitnir> 3/4 should be odd, 1/4 should be even
2010-11-22T15:43:59  <janzert> heh, only a week and I've already forgotten the details
2010-11-22T15:44:13  <janzert> Mjothvitnir: yep
2010-11-22T15:44:36  <McLeopold> maybe you should randomize the odd planet rounding?
2010-11-22T15:44:43  <Error323> McLeopold: where can i find the new maps?

2010-11-22T15:45:46  <janzert> yeah, if you cared about it, it would be easy to correct
2010-11-22T15:45:51  <McLeopold> That's why I like my generator better.  The center planet is optional. :)

2010-11-22T15:48:00  <janzert> planet number median and possibly mode might be interesting as well
2010-11-22T15:48:38  <janzert> and some actual density measurements, clustering and such but those get a lot harder to measure
2010-11-22T15:48:51  <Mjothvitnir> dang, if I was at home I could have spit those out already
2010-11-22T15:49:39  <McLeopold> density always is at the center for a radial map
2010-11-22T15:49:47  <Mjothvitnir> speaking of which, it is time to head there

2010-11-22T15:50:47  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah that would be interesting
2010-11-22T15:51:24  <McLeopold> oh, I should get a max distance average
2010-11-22T15:52:26  <janzert> yes, max distance averages and overall averages would certainly be nice to see and fairly easy to produce
2010-11-22T15:52:59  <McLeopold> it's hard to judge overall distance average
2010-11-22T15:53:17  <McLeopold> given (1,5,9) and (4,5,6), how do you compare?
2010-11-22T15:53:41  <McLeopold> clearly one is clustered and the other not
2010-11-22T15:54:23  <janzert> yeah, it's not as meaningful as the max distance average
2010-11-22T15:54:31  <janzert> if it has any use at all I guess
2010-11-22T15:55:13  <McLeopold> maybe if we only analyzed planets on one half of the map?

2010-11-22T15:57:46  <janzert> the median may be more interesting for overall average than the mean
2010-11-22T15:58:06  <McLeopold> median is the one in the center?
2010-11-22T15:58:31  <janzert> yes, if I understand you right :)
2010-11-22T15:58:57  <janzert> it would give a sort of clustering measure I think
2010-11-22T15:59:38  <janzert> the histogram would be pretty clearly better than either
2010-11-22T16:00:31  <McLeopold> avg      count: 22.15
2010-11-22T16:00:31  <McLeopold> mid      count: 23.00

2010-11-22T16:08:30  <McLeopold> you can see that the odd number planet maps have spikes. :)
2010-11-22T16:08:59  <McLeopold> growth looks pretty good, evenly spread
2010-11-22T16:10:08  <McLeopold> so it is the drop from an even number to an odd number that is pulling down the average
2010-11-22T16:10:19  <janzert> yep, even number planets seems a little low? but overall looks pretty good

2010-11-22T18:18:49  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bix0r4ever(3396), bocsimacko(3376), Raschi(3368), dmj111(3247), asavis(3169), davidjliu(3167), _Astek_(3142), medrimonia(3118), george(3111), protocolocon(3105)
2010-11-22T18:19:14  <burny> the top10 is getting tighter
2010-11-22T18:19:21  <bhasker> 27th is the submission dead line and your bot is already better than mine
2010-11-22T18:19:23  <burny> do they play more similarly too?
2010-11-22T18:19:25  <bhasker> so if you do submit my bot:p
2010-11-22T18:19:27  <bhasker> you will lose

2010-11-22T18:20:03  <bhasker> since its just bytecode
2010-11-22T18:20:08  <bhasker> its python
2010-11-22T18:20:12  <bhasker> so .pyc is cross platform
2010-11-22T18:20:14  <bhasker> should work
2010-11-22T18:20:17  <Error323> nice

2010-11-22T18:32:10  <bhasker> let me know if it works
2010-11-22T18:32:18  <McLeopold> can I run it on my tcp?
2010-11-22T18:32:18  <bhasker> MyBot.py the driver is a .py
2010-11-22T18:32:22  <bhasker> yea go ahead
2010-11-22T18:32:30  <bhasker> but it has no real logic
2010-11-22T18:32:34  <bhasker> the modules are all .pyc
2010-11-22T18:32:38  <McLeopold> I though it was good?
2010-11-22T18:33:13  <amstan> McLeopold: btw, this channel is logged and accessible through http, so you might not want to put emails in it
2010-11-22T18:33:23  <McLeopold> oops
2010-11-22T18:33:35  <bhasker> no i mean the .py has no logic thats exposed
2010-11-22T18:33:39  <McLeopold> gmail's got pretty good filters
2010-11-22T18:33:41  <Epona666> did everyone hear about china taking the lead in computing power?
2010-11-22T18:33:44  <amstan> ya, sure
2010-11-22T18:33:46  <amstan> lol
2010-11-22T18:34:09  <amstan> Epona666: and by computing power you mean fastest linux comp?
2010-11-22T18:34:37  <Epona666> i think its called Tianhe-1
2010-11-22T18:34:41  <Epona666> yes
2010-11-22T18:35:49  <McLeopold> bhasker: import error, bad magic number :(
2010-11-22T18:35:54  <bhasker> hmm weird
2010-11-22T18:35:56  <bhasker> it worked for e323
2010-11-22T18:36:07  <bhasker> run it as python ./MyBot.py
2010-11-22T18:36:16  <bhasker> which version of python are you using
2010-11-22T18:36:19  <bhasker> maybe thats the problem
2010-11-22T18:36:20  <bhasker> ?
2010-11-22T18:36:26  <bhasker> mine is running python 2.6 on mac
2010-11-22T18:36:34  <bhasker> so the pyc's are probably compiled for 2.6
2010-11-22T18:36:41  <McLeopold> hmm, okay
2010-11-22T18:36:50  <bhasker> try it with 2.6 if you have it installed
2010-11-22T18:36:50  <McLeopold> I"m on 2.7
2010-11-22T18:36:55  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-22T18:37:16  <bhasker> bad magic number probably looks like the .pyc carries the python version
2010-11-22T18:37:21  <bhasker> and its probably flunking because of that
2010-11-22T18:37:21  <McLeopold> 2.6.6?
2010-11-22T18:37:47  <bhasker> starevening-lm:minmax bhasker$ python --version
2010-11-22T18:37:47  <bhasker> Python 2.6.4
2010-11-22T18:37:47  <bhasker> s
2010-11-22T18:37:53  <bhasker> so 2.6.6 should work i think

2010-11-22T19:25:41  <Error323> i wonder :)
2010-11-22T19:25:50  <bhasker> he runs it from time to time just not continuously
2010-11-22T19:25:50  <McLeopold> By observing what it is capable of.
2010-11-22T19:26:05  <bhasker> and it kicks my bots butt quite regularly ^
2010-11-22T19:26:11  <medrimonia2> Don't worry Error323, I think antbot is really a lot better than my bot
2010-11-22T19:26:20  <McLeopold> ? really
2010-11-22T19:26:40  <medrimonia2> I think so, from what I remember and what I've seen
2010-11-22T19:26:46  <bhasker> i hate it when i start up a new version and it loses its first game
2010-11-22T19:26:54  <Error323> yeah me 2 >_<
2010-11-22T19:27:00  <bhasker> and the second oen

2010-11-22T19:28:08  <Error323> medrimonia2: which version
2010-11-22T19:28:12  <McLeopold> So, I can beat some of the best, but I lose to some not so good bots.
2010-11-22T19:28:16  <medrimonia2> 19.1^^
2010-11-22T19:28:23  <Error323> ah :P

2010-11-22T19:41:50  <medrimonia2> Hmm my attacks sucks, I haven't change them for more than a month
2010-11-22T19:41:53  <Error323> i didn't realize its power
2010-11-22T19:42:07  <Error323> and its quite tricky
2010-11-22T19:42:17  <bhasker> yes its hard to get it right
2010-11-22T19:42:17  <Error323> with the changing environment
2010-11-22T19:42:21  <bhasker> but when you do
2010-11-22T19:42:21  <medrimonia2> I'm more worried about expansion and all
2010-11-22T19:42:25  <bhasker> its a beautiful thing to watch
2010-11-22T19:42:29  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-22T19:42:36  <medrimonia2> I'm more defensive
2010-11-22T19:42:41  <Error323> But it should also be more effective
2010-11-22T19:42:49  <bhasker> yes it is
2010-11-22T19:42:56  <bhasker> cause enemy can't counter till all your ships launch
2010-11-22T19:43:01  <bhasker> makes it harder to snipe neutrals
2010-11-22T19:43:04  <medrimonia2> But I've still got a lot of issues I should fix, but there's not enough time remaining
2010-11-22T19:43:08  <bhasker> when you launch from multiple planets
2010-11-22T19:43:15  <Error323> yes
2010-11-22T19:43:28  <bhasker> medri keep working :) you will get there
2010-11-22T19:44:25  <medrimonia2> The best with this contest is that... when you've finished one thing, you've two other things to do
2010-11-22T19:44:35  <Error323> haha
2010-11-22T19:44:37  <Error323> so true
2010-11-22T19:44:38  <medrimonia2> So you can't finish
2010-11-22T19:46:19  <medrimonia2> I don't even know if I'll be able to improve my bot until the deadline because... for each little modification there's a lot of hours of work to verify that everything's right
2010-11-22T19:47:05  <McLeopold> bhasker: I don't think it makes it harder at all
2010-11-22T19:47:25  <McLeopold> who cares how many planets the fleets come from?
2010-11-22T19:47:31  <McLeopold> A snipe is a snipe
2010-11-22T19:48:17  <burny> and if you send 50 then 25.. at a 60.. the opponent is doing good to land 50 there inbetween teh 60 and 25
2010-11-22T19:48:58  <McLeopold> well, better, but not that good
2010-11-22T19:49:17  <McLeopold> it if you bring it down to the magical unsnipable range that's bad
2010-11-22T19:49:45  <medrimonia2> a lot of people are resubmitting these days^^
2010-11-22T19:50:49  <medrimonia2> In fact I would like to play galcon turn by turn, assisted by my bot, there it would be interesting
2010-11-22T19:51:09  <medrimonia2> (I don't like galcon in real time)
2010-11-22T19:53:32  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-22T19:53:52  <medrimonia2> It would be a really hard game
2010-11-22T19:53:52  <McLeopold> I wish I could tell my bot what was an important planet, live, and it would do the details.
2010-11-22T19:54:21  <McLeopold> Just click for the next target and have it stream, with defense turned on.
2010-11-22T19:54:21  <medrimonia2> Yes McLeopold: because sometimes... my bot is so stupid...
2010-11-22T19:55:00  <McLeopold> I tried beating RageBot in human mode. It's very hard, too much going on.
2010-11-22T19:55:17  <medrimonia2> Even Ragebot is hard????
2010-11-22T19:55:29  <McLeopold> Once it gets more than one planet, yes
2010-11-22T19:55:41  <McLeopold> Because you don't have a way to specify good fleet amounts
2010-11-22T19:55:53  <medrimonia2> Gosh I can't imagine playing against bocsimacko =P

2010-11-22T20:02:02  <Error323> start
2010-11-22T20:02:04  <Error323> i had it
2010-11-22T20:02:06  <medrimonia2> I think that my two worst weaknesses are my attacks and the fact that when I've less growth than the opponent, I don't try anything special
2010-11-22T20:02:08  <Error323> then thought, can't be done
2010-11-22T20:02:14  <Error323> and then heard others were doing it

2010-11-22T20:08:55  <medrimonia2> I don't understand why my bot is so strong on official...
2010-11-22T20:09:19  <Error323> tcp is just a random fest imo
2010-11-22T20:09:42  <medrimonia2> yep but I'm loosing a lot more on tcp than on official I think

2010-11-22T20:15:15  <rebelxt> Error323: initial wins help a bit in short term, but elo normally stabilizes after 50-100 games it seems
2010-11-22T20:15:53  <Error323> rebelxt: well my experiments tell otherwise
2010-11-22T20:16:30  <rebelxt> Error323: what about long run? i.e. do initial wins still matter after 200+ continuous games?
2010-11-22T20:16:56  <Error323> locally 19.0 is better than 19.0-1-gebc868e, but the latter is doing better with both of them running overnight
2010-11-22T20:17:21  <Error323> however i also tested it under another name and then it didn't perform better

2010-11-22T20:17:30  <rebelxt> Error323: 19.0.1 might be better against distribution of opponents on TCP even though it's weaker in local testing
2010-11-22T20:17:50  <rebelxt> i ran into this just recently too
2010-11-22T20:18:11  <Error323> yeah, its scary

2010-11-22T20:18:50  <Error323> i think 19.0.1 is better against strong bots, but weaker against weaker bots
2010-11-22T20:18:55  <rebelxt> local testing can lead to bad results sometimes.. it did in my case
2010-11-22T20:19:05  <Error323> so when it can't get out of local optima it gets stuck

2010-11-22T21:28:18  <Error323> i also need to do it for attacks though

2010-11-22T21:28:59  <antimatroid1> my moves consist of vectors of fleets, then i just add fleets to them from my planets
2010-11-22T21:29:28  <Error323> though also more rewarding probably

2010-11-22T22:29:07  <antimatroid1> and i'm testing new things
2010-11-22T22:30:03  <antimatroid1> i had that game in the bad though :(
2010-11-22T22:30:19  <flag> Yeah you had twice his production
2010-11-22T22:30:23  <flag> At the end there
2010-11-22T22:30:47  <antimatroid1> i've no idea what's causing invalid orders :|
2010-11-22T22:31:10  <antimatroid1> worst comes to worst hopefully it'll be fixed at the end when i put checks in before making moves
2010-11-22T22:31:47  <flag> I just check if my move is valid before I make it, although I try to fix the problems before they happen anyway
2010-11-22T22:32:17  <antimatroid1> yeah i used to have those checks, but then my old bot was so buggy i left them out with my new one, that way i knew of and was forced to fix any errors
2010-11-22T22:32:50  <antimatroid1> i'm getting my hopes up for top 10 again
2010-11-22T22:32:59  <antimatroid1> this bot seems to be good when it isn't making really stupid moves
2010-11-22T22:33:08  <antimatroid1> if i can iron out the stupid moves it might have a chance

2010-11-22T22:38:16  <antimatroid1> i need to work out how to model the opponent expanding
2010-11-22T22:38:41  <antimatroid1> the way i currently make my tree, it's hard to have them do that and not try to then snipe moves they haven't actually made

2010-11-22T22:39:43  <antimatroid1> yeah, that's alright, i mean having the opponent make expansionary moves in their nodes of the gametree
2010-11-22T22:40:09  <flag> Yeah I know what you mean
2010-11-22T22:40:53  <flag> I just try to see if I'd be able to defend an all-out attack my on my expansion
2010-11-22T22:41:25  <antimatroid1> each "move" in my game tree has a single destination
2010-11-22T22:41:31  <antimatroid1> then i just pick the best string of moves found
2010-11-22T22:42:27  <flag> So you try to calculate every possible move and pick the ones with the best chance of succeeding or what?

2010-11-22T22:53:10  <burny> attacking is usualyl better than just losing though
2010-11-22T22:53:11  <antimatroid1> if you can pick when it's best to do, sure, but i wouldn't make it standard
2010-11-22T22:53:24  <flag> It also depends on the growth of the planet you're trading it for
2010-11-22T22:53:33  <flag> Before I was just always defending

2010-11-22T22:54:36  <antimatroid1> there are two problems with the way i do my game tree
2010-11-22T22:54:36  <antimatroid1> 1. i don't consider them expanding, that can be bad on the first turn
2010-11-22T22:54:37  <antimatroid1> 2. it tries to take their planets after i've made moves for them, even on the first turn
2010-11-22T22:55:12  <flag> Maybe program the idea of potential moves into it?
2010-11-22T22:55:16  <antimatroid1> i need to try and fix those two things, or make them less of a problem before the deadline
2010-11-22T22:55:22  <flag> So you only take them into account in certian situations

2010-11-22T23:56:16  <virdo> Would anyone here know how you can run a bot from a (windows) batch file, and STDIN closing properly for the bot? Is there another solution for something like this?
2010-11-22T23:57:31  <virdo> In short, when I run a bot from another folder, it uses current folder for bots execution... no problem for most part (log files, whatever)... I can run the bot from a batch file that changes the starting directory to the proper bot root folder, but... it seems the batch file gets the STDIN close/end, but the bot never does... and so it hangs...
