2010-09-24T00:49:17  <bss03> 266/300 vs. Rage and 298/300 vs. Dual is a heckuva lot better than my submission just 3 days ago, though.

2010-09-24T03:22:26  <boegel> I've noticed too that tcp is not a good reference
2010-09-24T03:23:07  <antimatroid> yeah, but i had found that for the opposite ;)
2010-09-24T03:23:13  <boegel> on tcp my current bot (with a bug in it) has a win % of less dan 0.5, while on the official server it won 12 games and lost only 5
2010-09-24T03:23:13  <boegel> seems like the strongest bots are on tcp, right?
2010-09-24T03:23:31  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-09-24T03:23:40  <antimatroid> that's where people are testing out their latest ones
2010-09-24T03:23:41  <boegel> the opposite?
2010-09-24T03:23:48  <antimatroid> i just use main rankings for bragging rights atm
2010-09-24T03:23:57  <boegel> :)
2010-09-24T03:23:58  <antimatroid> that my bot does worse on the main site than tcp
2010-09-24T03:24:02  <antimatroid> seems wrong i know
2010-09-24T03:24:07  <rwa> how could anybody develop a good bot without the tcp server?  I couldn't.
2010-09-24T03:24:08  <antimatroid> but that's how it had worked up until now
2010-09-24T03:24:26  <antimatroid> rwa: lots of debugging by yourself and thinking about the problem
2010-09-24T03:24:42  <antimatroid> but i think one really needs to build up a feel with the heuristics for this game before moving onto that
2010-09-24T03:24:45  <antimatroid> so yeah, i agree
2010-09-24T03:24:54  <rwa> that's like saying you could get good at poker by playing with a deck of cards.  doesn't work that way.
2010-09-24T03:25:45  <antimatroid> i believe you could
2010-09-24T03:25:55  <antimatroid> realistically you want to do both though
2010-09-24T03:26:00  <rwa> right

2010-09-24T07:47:48  <tot_ra> well .. either each planet has its chromosome.. or most likely entire collection
2010-09-24T07:48:58  <boegel> tot_ra: I had something else entirely in mind, but I'll keep it to myself if you don't mind ;)
2010-09-24T07:49:06  <tot_ra> chromosome would probably have characteristicsl like.. agressiveness.. help fellow planet..
2010-09-24T07:49:45  <boegel> tot_ra: how would you evaluate fitness then? or just figure it out as you go?
2010-09-24T07:49:58  <boegel> tot_ra: the fitness might depend a lot on the state the game is in (e.g. winning/losing

2010-09-24T07:50:55  <antimatroid> although we will probably run a whole lot of games at some point trying to find the best parameters for different things

2010-09-24T08:25:01  <tot_ra> http://kurapov.name/eng/google_ai_challenge_eng/ some ideas :)
2010-09-24T08:29:19  <Naktibalda> 4. Take into account general region topology - some maps give opponent too much advantage
2010-09-24T08:29:31  <Naktibalda> maps are symetric, what kind of advantage is it?
2010-09-24T08:30:20  <olexs> I think what he means is that one has to consider map topology in the expansion strategy.
2010-09-24T08:30:59  <Naktibalda> tactic 5 sounds wrong too
2010-09-24T08:31:19  <tot_ra> hmmm.. true
2010-09-24T08:31:24  <Naktibalda> it's never a good idea to capture a neutral next to enemy planet
2010-09-24T08:31:43  <olexs> unless you know for sure you can hold it and it boosts your productivity a lot
2010-09-24T08:31:59  <Naktibalda> if you can hold it why do you leave the first planet?
2010-09-24T08:32:25  <Naktibalda> if enemy takes it cheap, it will have enough ships to capture a second planet too
2010-09-24T08:32:33  <olexs> true
2010-09-24T08:32:35  <Naktibalda> retreating is not an option
2010-09-24T08:32:46  <Naktibalda> all fights are 1:1 ship exchange
2010-09-24T08:33:09  <olexs> my bot doesn't do retreating, either, but I've though about a strategy that might include it
2010-09-24T08:33:10  <sigh> retreating is an option
2010-09-24T08:33:25  <sigh> for example, if you are behind you don't want to trade ships
2010-09-24T08:33:54  <olexs> I've tried changing my tactics to include abandoning planets that can't be defended anymore... results were actually disastrous
2010-09-24T08:34:01  <Naktibalda>  can you show me a game where it worked out well?
2010-09-24T08:34:29  <sigh> Naktibalda: not off the top of my head, but I do know that rwa's bot does it a lot
2010-09-24T08:34:34  <sigh> vortex on tcp
2010-09-24T08:34:38  <antimatroid> 5 is terrible advice
2010-09-24T08:35:20  <antimatroid> the one about abandoning a planet about to be taken that is
2010-09-24T08:35:31  <Naktibalda>  at least expand far from evemy, not close
2010-09-24T08:35:43  <antimatroid> not necessarily
2010-09-24T08:36:46  <Naktibalda> of course sending all ships to defence when you have a lower growth_rate is a bad idea. capture a few neutrals instead of feeding the enemy
2010-09-24T08:37:16  <antimatroid> yeah, but you don't want to capture so many neutrals that you then can't back that claim up
2010-09-24T08:37:29  <antimatroid> otherwise you just took out all the neutral ships for your opponent to come in and rape you
2010-09-24T08:37:46  <sigh> that's really a higher ship count, lower growth rate strategy
2010-09-24T08:38:46  <olexs> but having lower growth rate, one has to either 1) retake enemy planets where it's possible or b) expand to neutral planets, sending ships in direct confrontations will result in ship count difference getting larger and ultimately, losing.
2010-09-24T08:39:25  <sigh> direct confrontations doesn't make the ship coutn difference larger
2010-09-24T08:39:34  <sigh> *don't
2010-09-24T08:39:52  <olexs> if enemy has more growth than you and loses same amount of ships as you?
2010-09-24T08:40:28  <antimatroid> if you have less growth and ships and not the position strength to take their planets anyway, unless their bots retarded it's pretty much game over anyway
2010-09-24T08:40:31  <sigh> oh, i see what you mean
2010-09-24T08:40:33  <tot_ra> maybe Im exaggerating numbers but lets say you have 10 ships and +3 production and there are 100 enemy shiops coming in.. 10 turns... you can take over neighbour neutral planet with 15 ships + 2 steps that has 10 production That means that either you stay with 10+30 and die.. or retreat  10+6-15+5*6 and die with 42 ships :P

2010-09-24T12:05:52  <iouri_> boegel: it could be that his AI knows that it's already won and doesn't have to do anything.  My Tron AI had the same effect: if all sensible predicted move sequences led to victory, it started to do odd things.
2010-09-24T12:06:36  <boegel> iouri_: aren't the number of turns it takes to beat someone taken into account too?
2010-09-24T12:06:41  <boegel> it should be, imho
2010-09-24T12:06:47  <boegel> fast win = better win
2010-09-24T12:07:11  <olexs> that's true, but I don't think the elo system considers that
2010-09-24T12:07:29  <boegel> it would make the whole contest different
2010-09-24T12:07:31  <jesionaj> that seems like it'd be way too map dependant
2010-09-24T12:07:33  <boegel> now, you don't have to win
2010-09-24T12:07:43  <boegel> you just need to collect more planets than the other guy
2010-09-24T12:08:00  <olexs> well, by the definition of winning planetwars, that is a win
2010-09-24T12:08:13  <boegel> olexs: is it?
2010-09-24T12:08:24  <boegel> olexs: don't the number of ships also count?
2010-09-24T12:08:31  <olexs> it is the number of ships
2010-09-24T12:08:39  <boegel> ah, k, thought so
2010-09-24T12:09:04  <olexs> but number of planets does influence the ship number somewhat :)
2010-09-24T12:09:30  <boegel> olexs: it can

2010-09-24T12:09:57  <boegel> if I have 5 planets with growth rate 1, and you have 2 with growth rate 5 , I'm pretty much doomed
2010-09-24T12:10:11  <olexs> killing an opponent is a valid way to ensure he has less ships than you
2010-09-24T12:10:21  <olexs> but not the only one
2010-09-24T12:10:48  <boegel> true, didn't realise that until I was looking at the top games
2010-09-24T12:10:57  <boegel> I should take that into account probably
2010-09-24T12:11:11  <boegel> don't make moves that might kill yourself when you're ahead...
2010-09-24T12:11:46  <olexs> risky moves are only really allowable when you're losing and they are your chance to turn it around
2010-09-24T12:12:00  <boegel> true
2010-09-24T12:12:03  <olexs> in most other cases, playing it safe is the better way imho
2010-09-24T12:12:09  <boegel> I agree
2010-09-24T12:12:15  <boegel> but haven't taken that into account
2010-09-24T12:12:25  <boegel> I'm now able to get around rank 150
2010-09-24T12:12:30  <boegel> which is not too bad imho :)

2010-09-24T12:13:02  <boegel> if I get higher, so the better
2010-09-24T12:13:07  <olexs> I used to be somewhere around 70 a few days ago, the previous version stabilized around 100, current one is climbing now :)
2010-09-24T12:13:11  <boegel> I'm still having fun, and that's what counts
2010-09-24T12:13:14  <olexs> yep
2010-09-24T12:13:42  <boegel> olexs: you're olexs on the official server too?

2010-09-24T12:14:40  <boegel> olexs: going in the right direction, at least :)
2010-09-24T12:14:52  <boegel> I'm glad the server is handing out way more games than before
2010-09-24T12:15:06  <olexs> it is, but the competition is getting stronger all the time
2010-09-24T12:15:20  <boegel> my current bot sucks big time, but I made a wrong move
2010-09-24T12:15:30  <boegel> I'll let it rip for a while though, maybe I can learn from it
2010-09-24T12:15:35  <olexs> top100 was easy, say, a week ago
2010-09-24T12:18:39  <cYmen> mega1: re
2010-09-24T12:19:15  <mega1> cYmen: regarding the timeout, you can pass a higher timeout to the engine
2010-09-24T12:19:37  <cYmen> Yeah, of course...
2010-09-24T12:20:03  <mega1> other than that I find proxy bot more convenient.
2010-09-24T12:20:19  <mega1> I don't understand the second question.
2010-09-24T12:20:21  <cYmen> Yes, I should probably use that.

2010-09-24T12:20:48  <cYmen> There is something in the readme about adding something to the asdf file for recent sbcl versions to set the heap size, iiuc.
2010-09-24T12:21:10  <cYmen> I didn't really get what I'm actually supposed to do though. Sorry, I'm not really much of a lisper. :)

2010-09-24T12:25:19  <mega1> cYmen: the submitted bot should really not use more than 1G. SBCL has the command line option--dynamic-space-size to control the heap size.
2010-09-24T12:26:05  <mega1> We aim to limit the heap to some reasonable amount such as 768M for the submitted bot, but it's not yet implemented.
2010-09-24T12:26:35  <mega1> It works when running with run-bot.sh but does not work when running the MyBot  binary directly.
2010-09-24T12:27:08  <iouri_> boegel: taking the number of turns to beat someone might not be necessary if you're trying to maximize the number of ships you have more than your opponent.
2010-09-24T12:27:42  <boegel> iouri_: true, but if the number of turns is taken into account, that would make a worse bot then
2010-09-24T12:27:45  <cYmen> mega1: In so many words I'm fine with ignoring it all for now especially since I'm not going to submit anything any time soon, right?

2010-09-24T12:29:25  <mega1> cYmen: yes, you can ignore it. But be aware that with the default maximum heap size on 64bit SBCL being 8G (I think) there is no safe guard if your bot decides to hog memory.
2010-09-24T12:30:15  <cYmen> mega1: If I program nonsense I guess I deserve it. :)
2010-09-24T12:30:58  <jesionaj> Anyone else having trouble with the visualizer on the official server?
2010-09-24T12:31:41  <cYmen> mega1: How does the proxybot work exactly? The bot that is going to play and the slime bot both connect to a server? So are there three parties or is one of the aforementioned acting as server?
2010-09-24T12:31:43  <mega1> cYmen: "it", yes. Disqualification and being called cheater on the other hand ...
2010-09-24T12:33:30  <mega1> cYmen: the engine communicates with the proxy bot. The proxy bot connects to a server socket at a well known port where your a thread in your long running interactive development session answers its requests.
2010-09-24T12:34:15  <cYmen> alright

2010-09-24T13:15:04  <Janzert> great
2010-09-24T13:15:32  <Janzert> the original distributed proposal didn't seem to be that way so I was a little worried
2010-09-24T13:15:55  <danielvf> Ah.
2010-09-24T13:16:33  <customKoncept> :P so it turns out the competition has improved. again

2010-09-24T13:17:31  <danielvf> The cloud servers have a different CPU architecture. Until I get this handled properly, the testing server is only running bots that don't need compiling

2010-09-24T13:22:55  <danielvf> Was up to 45 GPM, but I decided I wanted to make sure that their's enough memory and cpu to go around.
2010-09-24T13:23:07  <Janzert> great
2010-09-24T13:23:30  <Janzert> yes, better to have slightly slower GPM and assure the quality

2010-09-24T13:47:34  <Janzert> I posted some very rough notes on the steps I used to set up
2010-09-24T13:47:42  <danielvf> coventry: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=645
2010-09-24T13:49:02  <Therexus> Obtw, Is there any way to know why our bot timeout without any apparent reasons ?
2010-09-24T13:49:19  <danielvf> Not at the moment
2010-09-24T13:49:22  * danielvf afk
2010-09-24T13:49:31  <coventry> Thanks Janzert, danielvf.  Will that definitely get me the same runtime environment as is being used on the server (same packages and configuration of 8.04?)  Not seeing how the configuration of that was determined.
2010-09-24T13:49:35  <Therexus> danielvf : ok thx
2010-09-24T13:49:50  <danielvf> coventry: We always use standard packages for all languages
2010-09-24T13:49:53  <Janzert> danielvf: would you be open to patches that would work on moving all configuration into a single file?
2010-09-24T13:50:02  <danielvf> coventry: except we compile node.js
2010-09-24T13:50:35  <danielvf> Janzert: hold off till I get the new distributed  bot running committed.
2010-09-24T13:50:47  <Janzert> ok
2010-09-24T13:51:49  <coventry> danielvf: sounds like you have a lot going on, and I don't want to bug you, but when you have the time, I still have some questions about this.  For instance, I understand numpy was available during the last competition, and probably is this time, too.  So numpy counts as a standard python package.  How about scipy?
2010-09-24T13:52:46  <danielvf> coventry: sorry, don't know at the moment - ask me when I back on, and I'll look it up
2010-09-24T13:53:17  <danielvf> coventry: I'm going to be making some definitive docs and a game server build script.
2010-09-24T13:54:08  <coventry> Thanks.  Just putting a list of all installed packages up somewhere would be hugely useful (with "dpkg --get-selections").
2010-09-24T13:54:41  <coventry> Oh, just saw you last comment about definitive docs and a script.  That'd be terrific.  Thanks very much.

2010-09-24T13:57:36  <coventry> (Actually, "dpkg-query -l" would potentially be even more useful.  Gives the package versions.)
2010-09-24T13:59:11  <Therexus> is there someone who can tell me how use a python bot with the TCP server of dhartmei ?
2010-09-24T14:00:23  <Therexus> i tried ./tcp <adress> <port> <nick> -p <mypass> "python MyBot.py" but it doesn't works
2010-09-24T14:01:00  <coventry> Did you use the values for address and port given at http://72.44.46.68/?
2010-09-24T14:01:14  <Therexus> yes i did
2010-09-24T14:01:25  <Zannick> make a shell script to run "python MyBot.py" so that your command is only "./bot.sh" or something
2010-09-24T14:01:38  <olexs> your bot command doesn't go in ""
2010-09-24T14:01:46  <nargil> try to make a script for launching your "python MyBot.py" and pass a single-word-file to the tcp server
2010-09-24T14:01:59  <Zannick> also, did dhartmei really add a password argument?
2010-09-24T14:02:08  <olexs> use "./tcp <adress> <port> <nick> -p <mypass> python MyBot.py" without enclosing the bot command
2010-09-24T14:02:23  <olexs> tcp binary composes the command itself
2010-09-24T14:02:30  <Therexus> olexs : ok I will trym thx
2010-09-24T14:02:51  * Therexus little reboot on ubuntu
2010-09-24T14:02:54  <coventry> dhartmei: The link to tcp.c from http://72.44.46.68/ appears to be dead, and replacing the benzedrine hostname with the new ip address results in a 400 error.

2010-09-24T14:16:55  <dwchandler> normally you put #!/usr/bin/python as the first line, and chmod +x MyBot.py

2010-09-24T14:26:58  <Therexus> There is a stacktrace so my bot can't receive game state so -> timeout -> defeated
2010-09-24T14:27:12  <Zannick> my guess is you timed out or did something invalid on turn 1, then tried to read again for the next turn but the tcp server told you the game was over by sending EOF
2010-09-24T14:27:19  <Zannick> er, not turn 1, i guess
2010-09-24T14:27:36  <Zannick> that appeared to be the turn in which all planets belonged to your opponent

2010-09-24T14:30:14  <Therexus> I watched the replay and effectively my bot didn't timed out at turn 1
2010-09-24T14:30:42  <jesionaj> Yeah, your bot played, but once the game was over you tried to read input and got an EOF
2010-09-24T14:31:43  <dhartmei> when you win or lose, tcp will simply close the pipe to the child, it will get eof
2010-09-24T14:31:44  <Therexus> ok so why timed out before end of the game ? I can understant a stacktrace after the end but before ..
2010-09-24T14:31:48  <Zannick> basically it isn't an error, except that the python bot isn't dying quietly when the game is over
2010-09-24T14:31:55  <dhartmei> there's no "proper" way to tell a bot it has won/lost and should terminate...
2010-09-24T14:32:11  <Zannick> the main server engine actually kills the bot
2010-09-24T14:32:20  <dhartmei> so does tcp, a second later
2010-09-24T14:32:47  <dhartmei> you can move the close() after the kill(), if you prefer :)
2010-09-24T14:33:14  <Zannick> i would enclose raw_input in try: and put an except clause for EOFError to return from main()
2010-09-24T14:33:47  <Therexus> Zannick : i understand but when i watch the replay my last move isn't over
2010-09-24T14:34:19  <Zannick> yes, i suspect you did something bad, so the engine ended the game there

2010-09-24T18:26:40  <boegel> (I lost that game)
2010-09-24T18:26:52  <Zannick> or you made an invalid move
2010-09-24T18:27:10  <boegel> Zannick: impossible with the changes I made
2010-09-24T18:27:23  <boegel> and my previous bots have been working just fine
2010-09-24T18:28:10  <Zannick> well, those are the possibilities
2010-09-24T18:28:22  <AJC> maybe Hi-tech used the new "intimidate" API.
2010-09-24T18:28:32  <boegel> Zannick: yeah, I'm aware of that
2010-09-24T18:28:40  <boegel> AJC: ? :)
2010-09-24T18:28:52  <AJC> boegel: your bot got scared, that's option 3.
2010-09-24T18:30:08  <boegel> AJC: I doubt that :P
2010-09-24T18:30:19  <Zannick> javagamer: you could grab the source off of the tcp webserver, say, by taking a game from there, downloading the js and whatnot, wipe the playback that's there, write a script to create html files from that, putting the playback in the right place
2010-09-24T18:30:20  <boegel> here's the replay on my end:
2010-09-24T18:30:20  <boegel> $ python parse_game_state_url.py http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4705009 | ./MyBot
2010-09-24T18:30:21  <boegel> 1 11 79
2010-09-24T18:30:21  <boegel> 1 10 16
2010-09-24T18:30:21  <boegel> 1 2 5
2010-09-24T18:30:21  <boegel> go
2010-09-24T18:30:34  <boegel> 79+16+5 = 100, so that's legit
2010-09-24T18:30:40  <boegel> only other option is time-out then
2010-09-24T18:30:47  <boegel> in the first turn? :)
2010-09-24T18:30:50  <boegel> no way
2010-09-24T18:31:22  <Migi32> maybe you got a bug somewhere and it crashed?
2010-09-24T18:31:40  <boegel> Migi32: well, I don't see it crashing in the replay
2010-09-24T18:32:15  * boegel scratches his head
2010-09-24T18:32:45  <Migi32> I'm new to this, so I don't know much about all this yet, but maybe it's a bug in the form of an infinite loop?
2010-09-24T18:33:07  <Zannick> weird
2010-09-24T18:33:27  <Zannick> the playback string includes the turn
2010-09-24T18:33:42  <boegel> Migi32: just resubmitted, new game played, works fine
2010-09-24T18:33:44  <jmreardon> boegel: it says you won…?
2010-09-24T18:33:50  <Zannick> i see a player 2 fleet
2010-09-24T18:33:58  <boegel> jmreardon: I saw a 'loss' in my profile...
2010-09-24T18:34:32  <Zannick> yeah, the visualizer page doesn't say who won
2010-09-24T18:34:38  <Zannick> in cases like that
2010-09-24T18:34:44  <Zannick> unless you view source
2010-09-24T18:34:46  <jmreardon> boegel: oh, whoops, was looking at the game with the new version
2010-09-24T18:35:02  <boegel> jmreardon: ah :)
2010-09-24T18:35:18  <Zannick> freak timeout?
2010-09-24T18:35:31  <boegel> Zannick: are the p11-79, p10-16 and p2-5 fleets in the source?
2010-09-24T18:35:36  <boegel> yeah, seems like it
2010-09-24T18:35:55  <Zannick> boegel: no
2010-09-24T18:36:18  <jmreardon> boegel: could it have something to do with you sending out all 100 ships?
2010-09-24T18:37:38  <Zannick> that should not be an error
2010-09-24T18:39:13  <jmreardon> I was thinking more on the lines of the bot not handling it right
2010-09-24T18:39:30  <Zannick> well, he does it just fine in his other game

2010-09-24T20:35:43  <boegel> antimatroid: I like it that way, as long as I keep seeing progres
2010-09-24T20:35:55  <boegel> Haskell code is fun to make adjustments in, it's fast
2010-09-24T20:36:12  <boegel> my current bot is only like 200 lines of code
2010-09-24T20:36:19  <boegel> give or take
2010-09-24T20:36:29  <boegel> and it's able to reach rank 150-ish
2010-09-24T20:36:36  <boegel> in a good config :)
2010-09-24T20:36:37  <antimatroid> yeah, but i want a top 10 finish :)
2010-09-24T20:36:54  <boegel> antimatroid: my next goal is to reach top 100, and then go from there
2010-09-24T20:37:05  <boegel> antimatroid: I'd like to end up as high as possible too
2010-09-24T20:37:15  <antimatroid> i'm currently at 16 on the main site
2010-09-24T20:37:21  <boegel> antimatroid: nice
2010-09-24T20:37:39  <boegel> antimatroid: youwillfail?
2010-09-24T20:37:42  <antimatroid> yep
2010-09-24T20:37:52  <sigh> antimatroid: my bot slowly moved up, it's not *as* bad as I thought
2010-09-24T20:37:59  <antimatroid> it's not as good as a previous bot though, so i'm a little confused, it's just better at not losing at the start of some games
2010-09-24T20:38:14  <boegel> loss ratio of about 25%
2010-09-24T20:38:16  <antimatroid> sigh: mine is apparently sustaining much higher than expected

2010-09-24T20:39:05  <boegel> seeing progress is hard, because competition is getting tougher
2010-09-24T20:39:36  <boiserm> yes, there is a slow downward drift in rankings if you're mid-range and don't keep improving
2010-09-24T20:39:46  <sigh> I my bot started losing when it was ranked ~35 but slowly made its way up
2010-09-24T20:40:54  <antimatroid> my current bot lost to some of the better people it used to beat
2010-09-24T20:40:59  <antimatroid> but doesn't lose to lower ranked people anymore
2010-09-24T20:41:10  <antimatroid> go figure
2010-09-24T20:41:26  <sigh> heh
2010-09-24T20:41:52  <antimatroid> i just hope this method for coordinated attacks works

2010-09-24T23:22:36  <antimatroid> it's more the fact that this way handles sending fleets from any planet

2010-09-24T23:42:58  <sb8244> no
2010-09-24T23:43:04  <sb8244> i guess i need "java MyBot"
2010-09-24T23:43:13  <amstan> is your bot in java?
2010-09-24T23:43:17  <sb8244> yes
2010-09-24T23:43:22  <amstan> is it in the current folder?
2010-09-24T23:43:34  <sb8244> yes
2010-09-24T23:43:42  <amstan> ok, then java MyBot should work

2010-09-24T23:47:01  <amstan> i think you need to make a wrapper
2010-09-24T23:47:06  <amstan> since java's special like that
2010-09-24T23:47:07  <sb8244> ??
2010-09-24T23:47:14  <amstan> make a MyBot.sh
2010-09-24T23:47:20  <amstan> put a #! line
2010-09-24T23:47:28  <amstan> then the command to run your bot
2010-09-24T23:47:38  <amstan> and in the tcp command give it ./MyBot.sh
