2011-02-11T00:04:14  <McLeopold> I don't think I follow
2011-02-11T00:04:28  <antimatroid1> when you resolve food squares after battles
2011-02-11T00:04:31  <antimatroid1> what radius are you using?
2011-02-11T00:04:45  <McLeopold> same as attack, but I think it should be smaller
2011-02-11T00:04:59  <antimatroid1> that's what i'm talking about, shall we add an extra parameter in everywhere for that?
2011-02-11T00:05:09  <antimatroid1> i'm wondering if 1 would work best for that
2011-02-11T00:05:15  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-11T00:05:21  <antimatroid1> it means you can never have a contest over a food square and you have to go right up to it
2011-02-11T00:05:30  <antimatroid1> it'd also make snakebot easier
2011-02-11T00:05:36  <antimatroid1> which is extremely important
2011-02-11T00:05:56  <antimatroid1> what should such a parameter be called?
2011-02-11T00:06:00  <antimatroid1> foodradius doesn't seem right?
2011-02-11T00:06:07  <McLeopold> birthradius
2011-02-11T00:07:07  <antimatroid1> done
2011-02-11T00:07:10  <antimatroid1> on etherpad
2011-02-11T00:07:40  <McLeopold> can you make everything monospace?
2011-02-11T00:07:42  <antimatroid1> all my timer stuff is in seconds, now i have to convert upon reading :P
2011-02-11T00:07:53  <antimatroid1> how would i do that?
2011-02-11T00:08:08  <McLeopold> select all and change the font
2011-02-11T00:08:41  <antimatroid1> ?
2011-02-11T00:08:48  <antimatroid1> which font?
2011-02-11T00:08:48  <McLeopold> to courier
2011-02-11T00:08:59  <antimatroid1> is that done?
2011-02-11T00:09:18  <McLeopold> I don't see the change.  I think my browser is just screwed up.
2011-02-11T00:10:26  <McLeopold> yeah, it's the browser, chrome on linux
2011-02-11T00:12:44  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: 1 or 3 for birthradius do you think?
2011-02-11T00:12:53  <McLeopold> 5
2011-02-11T00:13:12  <McLeopold> attack is 9
2011-02-11T00:13:17  <McLeopold> or 10
2011-02-11T00:13:22  <antimatroid1> that's larger?
2011-02-11T00:13:34  <McLeopold> view is 96
2011-02-11T00:14:45  <antimatroid1> yeah, but 4 for attack gives the 2 unit diamond
2011-02-11T00:15:20  <McLeopold> so?
2011-02-11T00:15:35  <antimatroid1> you wont get battles with people up close
2011-02-11T00:15:42  <antimatroid1> because they wont be able to get anywhere near each other
2011-02-11T00:15:43  <McLeopold> attack is 10
2011-02-11T00:16:05  <McLeopold> oh, well, this is still with bad micro
2011-02-11T00:16:09  <McLeopold> whatever
2011-02-11T00:16:21  <McLeopold> don't make it 4, at least 5
2011-02-11T00:16:28  <McLeopold> I don't like diamond shapes
2011-02-11T00:16:34  <antimatroid1> you're still wanting option 2 for battle aren't you?
2011-02-11T00:16:42  <antimatroid1> i'm still hoping for option 1 to prevail
2011-02-11T00:17:05  <McLeopold> I'd rather have that, with some interesting game elements.  But if we don't get other game elements, I'd go with 1
2011-02-11T00:17:07  <antimatroid1> it doesn't matter atm anyway
2011-02-11T00:17:34  <McLeopold> yeah, I'm thinking rush to get tcp working, build the bot, then demonstrate option 2 is broken
2011-02-11T00:17:48  <antimatroid1> i think it's awesome how simple everything is with 1 yet still complex
2011-02-11T00:18:17  <McLeopold> yes, jmcarthur and I were pleased with the elegance
2011-02-11T00:18:20  <antimatroid1> i'll put something in my makeMoves function when tcp turns up for testing
2011-02-11T00:24:26  <antimatroid1> hmm, this is starting to feel quite a bit like that snowman game

2011-02-11T00:28:51  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: the larger the attack and birth radius's the more expensive it becomes to check the result of moves
2011-02-11T00:30:20  <McLeopold> I'm looping through ants, so it only matters the number of ants
2011-02-11T00:30:38  <McLeopold> Option 1 would be faster.
2011-02-11T00:31:48  <antimatroid1> looping through ants?
2011-02-11T00:31:55  <antimatroid1> oh, and finding distances?
2011-02-11T00:37:06  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-02-11T00:37:10  <McLeopold> I can't remember
2011-02-11T00:37:37  <McLeopold> nope
2011-02-11T00:37:49  <McLeopold> I'm doing a recursive check for enemies and crossing the ants of the list
2011-02-11T00:37:59  <McLeopold> so, kinda looping through ants
2011-02-11T00:39:40  <McLeopold> I need to learn make files
2011-02-11T00:41:00  *** chris_0076 <chris_0076!~Chris_007@adsl-176-227-99.asm.bellsouth.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-11T00:43:16  <antimatroid1> i was checking each ants cells within range for enemies
2011-02-11T00:43:40  <McLeopold> yeah, same here
2011-02-11T00:43:59  <antimatroid1> and i had the directions in a constant array rather than actually painting outwards
2011-02-11T00:44:30  <antimatroid1> as in the arrays needed to add info to a location to get straight there
2011-02-11T00:46:33  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: if you have viewradius v and attackradius a, you need v > 2a +2 (i think) in order for option 1 battle resolution to be always calculatable for bots
2011-02-11T00:47:58  <antimatroid1> it will also make it much harder to see what the hell happened as the attack region gets larger
2011-02-11T00:48:12  <McLeopold> v >= 2a
2011-02-11T00:48:34  <antimatroid1> oh yeah, i was thinking if they were just outside
2011-02-11T00:48:38  <antimatroid1> but then it'd be irrelevant :P
2011-02-11T00:48:46  <antimatroid1> it might get messier with euclidean
2011-02-11T00:49:14  <McLeopold> v >= 2a+2 , cause ants can move toward each other
2011-02-11T00:49:25  <McLeopold> and they won't know the status until after battle
2011-02-11T00:49:50  <antimatroid1> sure, but if you are working out moves to make, you want to "evaluate" a state to see what happens
2011-02-11T00:50:11  <antimatroid1> option 1 allows bots to be sure their "evaluation" is always correct for any anything close enough to touch them
2011-02-11T00:50:12  <McLeopold> I think that's a good parameter for vision radius
2011-02-11T00:50:22  <antimatroid1> i'm not debating vision, i like that a lot
2011-02-11T00:50:32  <antimatroid1> i don't think fight and birth should be too large though
2011-02-11T00:50:35  <McLeopold> me neither, I'm agreeing
2011-02-11T00:50:48  <McLeopold> no, 5 max for attack
2011-02-11T00:51:01  <McLeopold> maybe 10
2011-02-11T00:51:08  <McLeopold> but no larger
2011-02-11T00:51:31  <McLeopold> and, sry, I keep using radius^2
2011-02-11T00:51:37  <antimatroid1> my ideal game would be, view = 9.6, attack = 2, birth = 1, battle resolution 1
2011-02-11T00:57:14  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: is that just saying that if a square is an ant/food square when you first see it, you wont also see it as land?

2011-02-11T02:04:39  <janzert> antimatroid I've stated that view in the past and still feel it's ideal
2011-02-11T02:07:38  <antimatroid1> janzert: I think mcleopold is more concerned about minimising input passed
2011-02-11T02:07:46  <antimatroid1> but surely it's quite fast anywya?
2011-02-11T02:08:23  <antimatroid1> at worst each player needs to receive the same number of lines as squares
2011-02-11T02:08:34  <janzert> yeah, it was in the past and I would certainly expect it not to be much here either
2011-02-11T02:09:16  <janzert> right I would just send the whole map centered on the player's start square, with all unvisible squares blocked out
2011-02-11T02:09:29  <janzert> the only downside of course is it gives away the map size right away
2011-02-11T02:09:41  <janzert> so I could see changing it for that reason
2011-02-11T02:09:48  <janzert> but not really for anything else
2011-02-11T02:10:00  <antimatroid1> i don't think there's need to centre it, just paint outwards from players squares printing any square info that is "seeable"
2011-02-11T02:10:16  <janzert> minimizing IO amount certainly doesn't seem like a priority
2011-02-11T02:10:54  <janzert> not centering it could give away number of players?
2011-02-11T02:11:05  <antimatroid1> i don't think so
2011-02-11T02:11:11  <antimatroid1> you're still getting the overall dimensions
2011-02-11T02:11:22  <antimatroid1> we could just translate the maps when generated, but i don't think it helps
2011-02-11T02:13:10  <janzert> yeah, I guess maybe it doesn't give away any more than the overall size
2011-02-11T02:13:25  <janzert> are we giving them that anyway initially or not?
2011-02-11T02:13:29  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-02-11T02:13:39  <antimatroid1> i think you could try and work out player numbers with dimensions
2011-02-11T02:13:50  <antimatroid1> work out what "region placements" allow for the given dimensions
2011-02-11T02:14:18  <janzert> ahh, then yeah just send the the map with only the correct squares revealed and be done with it
2011-02-11T02:14:23  <antimatroid1> would it really change much strategy wise if we knew the number of starting players?
2011-02-11T02:14:51  <janzert> possibly, depends a lot on what the details of the final game are of course
2011-02-11T02:14:51  <antimatroid1> provided you didn't know how many are currently alive

2011-02-11T04:07:07  <antimatroid> they only recently popped up
2011-02-11T04:08:12  <Frontier> as well as the secular party, as if we hadn't abolished religion in the state busines long ago
2011-02-11T04:08:34  <antimatroid> gay marriage still isn't allowed here etc.
2011-02-11T04:08:38  <antimatroid> it's pretty stupid
2011-02-11T04:08:57  <antimatroid> if people want to hold a ceremony and call it marriage, it's of nobody elses business
2011-02-11T04:09:17  <Frontier> Does religion have a strong influence on politics?
2011-02-11T04:09:39  <antimatroid> not a huge one, although it has made some appearances in the last few years when i wouldn't expect
2011-02-11T04:09:59  <antimatroid> the prime minister is an atheist, but claims to not agree with gay marriage
2011-02-11T04:10:01  <Frontier> Well if it is a christian ceremony I can understand that priests say no.
2011-02-11T04:10:26  <antimatroid> yeah sure, but you basically can't do a gay marriage and have it recognised even if the church is willing
2011-02-11T04:10:33  <antimatroid> that is quite silly
2011-02-11T04:10:58  <Frontier> ah ok.
2011-02-11T04:11:56  <antimatroid> if i was to ever do something like marriage, i'd probably get a civil union or whatever (provided the girl was cool with it) just out of protest
2011-02-11T04:12:38  <Frontier> now i need a dictionary
2011-02-11T04:12:54  <antimatroid> i'm also a little disappointed at the amount of racism that's still here
2011-02-11T04:13:00  <antimatroid> i've been surprised about that a few times too
2011-02-11T04:13:27  <Frontier> ah you mean a 'eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft'
2011-02-11T04:13:38  <antimatroid> haha what?
2011-02-11T04:13:39  <Frontier> hmm i prefer civil union
2011-02-11T04:13:46  <Frontier> it is way shorter
2011-02-11T04:14:26  <antimatroid> i think the whole thing is insance, christians didn't invent the concept of marriage, they made similar arguments about inter racial marriage etc. it's insane that it's still even an issue
2011-02-11T04:14:31  <antimatroid> insane*
2011-02-11T04:14:35  <Frontier> Racism against native australians or in general?
2011-02-11T04:14:47  <antimatroid> probably both
2011-02-11T04:14:56  <sigh> in general
2011-02-11T04:15:04  <antimatroid> there are a lot of people who have a very negative view on emigration etc.
2011-02-11T04:15:33  <antimatroid> worst was someone i had met down here raping and killing some uni student, the guy even had a gf, wtf, but that's a very big edge case
2011-02-11T04:15:42  <antimatroid> there are quite a few racial bashings etc. though
2011-02-11T04:16:22  <antimatroid> i used to think it was more that anyone is going to get bashed, of course some international people will, but the last few years, especially some stuff in tasmania has led me to think people actually do actively go out looking to attack people on racial motives
2011-02-11T04:16:26  <antimatroid> it's quite disgusting
2011-02-11T04:16:35  <Frontier> Well you can find it here too. Some people believe that the Turks will flood Germany and make everything islamic and take our freedoms and... you get the idea
2011-02-11T04:17:16  <Frontier> you knew the rapist?! Oo
2011-02-11T04:17:30  <antimatroid> i have met him, i never chose to associate with him
2011-02-11T04:17:36  <antimatroid> the guy wasn't someone you want to associate with
2011-02-11T04:17:56  <antimatroid> he was one of my friends old neighbours and was generally known around the skatepark where i spent a lot of my teen years
2011-02-11T04:18:44  <antimatroid> and i'm pretty sure the guy got like 15-25 years in jail
2011-02-11T04:18:55  <antimatroid> the australian legal system is far too leniant on violent crimes
2011-02-11T04:19:11  <Frontier> hopefully he gets enough time to think about it
2011-02-11T04:19:21  <antimatroid> depends, some people thrive in prison
2011-02-11T04:19:45  <antimatroid> although i doubt most would actually enjoy being in there
2011-02-11T04:20:05  <antimatroid> i don't plan to ever find out
2011-02-11T04:20:48  <Frontier> The EU has recently requested that we should free prisoners that have ended their time in prison and are currently in "security capture" because they are still considered a danger to society
2011-02-11T04:21:31  <antimatroid> i quite like our governments response to taking guntanomo (no idea how to spell) prisoners that aren't charged
2011-02-11T04:21:32  <Frontier> They say it is agains human rights to keep people captive after they payed their dues
2011-02-11T04:21:47  <antimatroid> despite constantly touting the importance of innocent until proven guilty, they wanted nothing to do with them
2011-02-11T04:22:10  <antimatroid> paid their dues is a very sketchy term
2011-02-11T04:22:20  <antimatroid> the legal system seems very arbitrary sometimes
2011-02-11T04:22:29  <Frontier> sorry, i didn't find any other term in the quickness
2011-02-11T04:22:46  <antimatroid> i don't like how inconsistent punishments are to crimes
2011-02-11T04:22:54  *** smellyhippy <smellyhippy!~asmodean@about/csharp/regular/smellyhippy> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-11T04:23:05  <antimatroid> it's often easy to find examples where crime a was obviously worse than crime b, but the punishment for crime a was more leniant
2011-02-11T04:23:07  <Frontier> they marked their time
2011-02-11T04:23:19  <antimatroid> i think it should be one of the goals to have such a consistency
2011-02-11T04:23:22  <sigh> it's a hard problem... you have to treat cases individually, but it leads to inconsistancies
2011-02-11T04:23:42  <antimatroid> sigh: i know it's not an easy problem, but i think it could be handled better than it currently is
2011-02-11T04:24:02  <Frontier> well they have precedence cases
2011-02-11T04:24:03  <sigh> sure, I agree
2011-02-11T04:24:13  <antimatroid> i also don't understand why i can't partial vote in elections
2011-02-11T04:24:15  <antimatroid> it's retarded
2011-02-11T04:24:18  <sigh> but just saying that the current system sucks is not very productive
2011-02-11T04:24:32  <sigh> partial vote?
2011-02-11T04:25:00  <antimatroid> preference only some of the candidates, if my vote gets far enough to run out, it becomes invalid
2011-02-11T04:25:44  <Frontier> Oh how I wish to de-vote some people sometimes ^^
2011-02-11T04:25:50  <sigh> yeah, fair enough... although that won't affect the result in a meaningful way, you are still making a statement
2011-02-11T04:25:59  <antimatroid> Frontier: why?
2011-02-11T04:26:02  <Frontier> I'm like "I vote for anything, but not THIS coalition"
2011-02-11T04:26:21  <antimatroid> oh, i thought you weren't agreeing with what i said
2011-02-11T04:26:38  <antimatroid> sigh: wilkie won in tassie because of fall through votes
2011-02-11T04:26:39  <sigh> IRC downvotes :P
2011-02-11T04:26:43  <Frontier> No I was just laughing because it will never happen
2011-02-11T04:27:15  <antimatroid> there were people in one electorate complaining because they didn't realise they were voting for an indiginous person that one
2011-02-11T04:27:18  <antimatroid> won*
2011-02-11T04:27:33  <Frontier> lol what a fraud
2011-02-11T04:27:33  <sigh> antimatroid: my point is that by not letting your votes run through, one of those candidates will still make office
2011-02-11T04:27:48  <antimatroid> sigh: doesn't matter, i don't want my vote to go to them
2011-02-11T04:28:08  <antimatroid> i was going to put an invalid vote in because i didn't care who won out of kevin or abbott
2011-02-11T04:28:10  <sigh> antimatroid: I know, which is why I said it's more of a statement than anything that actually matters
2011-02-11T04:28:19  <antimatroid> but i ended up passing the votes to labour, just because i can't stand abott
2011-02-11T04:28:28  <Frontier> what are you talking about. I don't think I have heard of such a voting system?
2011-02-11T04:28:35  <antimatroid> sigh: try saying that to people about not voting :P
2011-02-11T04:28:54  <antimatroid> an individual vote doesn't count for anything, people witnessing and acting upon that act or knowledge does
2011-02-11T04:28:57  <sigh> Frontier: never heard of preferential voting
2011-02-11T04:28:58  <sigh> ?
2011-02-11T04:29:13  <antimatroid> Frontier: we do at least have a semi sane voting system
2011-02-11T04:29:20  <Frontier> uh maybe... it is a bit difficult in Englisch for me
2011-02-11T04:29:29  <antimatroid> and semi compulsory voting
2011-02-11T04:29:42  <antimatroid> if you never enrol, they never bother you, but if you enrol and don't vote, you get fined
2011-02-11T04:29:46  <antimatroid> i find that amusingly stupid
2011-02-11T04:29:54  <Frontier> I'll look it up in Wikipedia
2011-02-11T04:30:34  <sigh> antimatroid: they bothered me until I enrolled
2011-02-11T04:30:39  <Frontier> So you put yourself at risk for enrolling
2011-02-11T04:30:49  <antimatroid> sigh: pretty sure they give up after a while
2011-02-11T04:30:54  <antimatroid> a lot of my friends never enroled
2011-02-11T04:31:02  <sigh> i see
2011-02-11T04:31:31  <sigh> anyway, I'm happy to vote
2011-02-11T04:31:43  <Frontier> Oh cool, so you order the candidates by preference, rather than just making a cross next to a person
2011-02-11T04:31:43  <antimatroid> Frontier: the christians are also bitching atm because of new ethics classes in primary schools
2011-02-11T04:31:47  <antimatroid> sigh: same
2011-02-11T04:31:53  <sigh> Frontier: right
2011-02-11T04:32:07  <antimatroid> and if a candidate gets knocked out, your vote goes on to the next person
2011-02-11T04:32:15  <sigh> so you don't have to worry much about wasting your vote
2011-02-11T04:32:32  <antimatroid> but you have to preference everyone (or let the parties do it for you, most people do that)
2011-02-11T04:32:39  <Frontier> Hey MY religion teacher back then told me God and his son had an argument and they founded two seperate churches, catholic and protestant
2011-02-11T04:32:44  <antimatroid> my argument is i should be able to preference some of them, then have my vote stop counting
2011-02-11T04:33:25  <sigh> Frontier: more like people got pissed off with the pope for letting people buy their way into heaven :P
2011-02-11T04:34:33  <antimatroid> i hear pope and think child abuse hehe
2011-02-11T04:35:00  <Frontier> See, now you have prejudices, too :o)
2011-02-11T04:35:22  <antimatroid> i sit on the fence with religion, weak agnostic :P
2011-02-11T04:35:49  <antimatroid> although that's more with a notion of god being something that created what we call the universe
2011-02-11T04:36:12  <Frontier> Sometimes religion works like opium for the people I think
2011-02-11T04:36:15  <sigh> "god" is horrendously ill-defined
2011-02-11T04:36:42  <antimatroid> sigh: i personally just take it to be that which created what we call the universe
2011-02-11T04:37:21  <antimatroid> if no such god exists, then we came from nothing, before time or even the concept of nothing existed. if we were created, then what created the creator? same issue, ad infinitum
2011-02-11T04:37:29  <antimatroid> that basically summarises my thoughts on religion
2011-02-11T04:37:32  <Frontier> I heard some religious muslim complain about how God in the western world is merely some guy up in the clouds with no relation to people's lives. He surely preferred to have a connection of politics and religion
2011-02-11T04:38:08  <sigh> even then,"god" carries too many connotations... even if your description it is a *single*, *sentient* being who created the universe with a *purpose*
2011-02-11T04:38:16  <Frontier> antimatroid: And at some point you just stop caring.
2011-02-11T04:38:23  <sigh> with probably many other implicit assumptions
2011-02-11T04:38:25  <antimatroid> sigh: not necessarily
2011-02-11T04:38:56  <antimatroid> i also hold such an agnostic view about whether something independent exists external to our universe, and whether it could ever be "known" that such a place exists etc.
2011-02-11T04:39:23  <antimatroid> i simply argue that i have never been presented a sufficient argument to make me decide either way
2011-02-11T04:39:27  <sigh> antimatroid: maybe not, but the way you describe it and also the way you label it strongly implies it, imo
2011-02-11T04:39:43  <sigh> which is why I say that "god" is horrendously ill-defined
2011-02-11T04:39:57  <sigh> people use it as a place holder for wildly different things
2011-02-11T04:40:00  <antimatroid> as far as i'm concerned, i don't know i wasn't created 10 seconds ago with all my memories as part of a simulation to see how we'd act
2011-02-11T04:40:09  <sigh> sure
2011-02-11T04:40:38  <Frontier> god is a term like ai. what is ai. did ai create us?
2011-02-11T04:40:59  <sigh> and I don't know whether you are human, or just a very advanced talking giraffe, but I'm hardly on the fence about that :P
2011-02-11T04:41:01  <antimatroid> "did ai create us?" that's a new one, i like it
2011-02-11T04:41:04  <Frontier> Do we flee into techocracy because we need religion?
2011-02-11T04:41:07  <sigh> *typing
2011-02-11T04:41:38  <antimatroid> i personally think religions were a way people exploited peoples need for answers in order to control them
2011-02-11T04:41:51  <sigh> that is a naive view, I think
2011-02-11T04:42:00  <antimatroid> and people wanting answers
2011-02-11T04:42:08  <sigh> that is more reasonable
2011-02-11T04:42:40  <sigh> given the prevelence of religion, even in small tribal communities... there is more to it than simple exploitation
2011-02-11T04:42:43  <Frontier> sounds like the opium view. back then when thunder and storm couldnt be explained it served as an explanation
2011-02-11T04:42:47  <antimatroid> i do think quite a few religious people throughout human history were in it for control though
2011-02-11T04:43:11  <sigh> sure, but they were using a tool which was already there
2011-02-11T04:43:32  <sigh> I don't think that you could do something like that, unless people already had some predisposition
2011-02-11T04:44:36  <antimatroid> hmm, i don't know, i expect even when such things were coming to exist the people molding what they became may not have always had pure intent
2011-02-11T04:44:54  <Frontier> Now I think of shamans smoking crazy things telling the tribe about the gods ^^
2011-02-11T04:45:03  <antimatroid> i do think most religious people are generally good people with pure intent though
2011-02-11T04:45:09  <sigh> I think that the simplest explanation is that that people are pattern recognition machines, and more specifically intelligent-agent detectors... we anthropomorphise everything
2011-02-11T04:45:44  <Frontier> sigh... you need some fresh air :p
2011-02-11T04:46:36  <Frontier> what does antropomorphise mean ?

2011-02-11T04:50:09  <Frontier> Now that I know what it means - antropomorphism is one of the reasons why I don't believe in God.
2011-02-11T04:50:46  <sigh> I don't quite understand what you mean?
2011-02-11T04:51:38  <Frontier> Well people usually imagine God as some person that is their better self.
2011-02-11T04:51:51  <sigh> oh yes, sure
2011-02-11T04:52:16  <antimatroid> aren't they the devil and angel on my shoulders?
2011-02-11T04:52:51  <sigh> yeah... that's annoying to argue against it... they project their opinion onto God, who they claim is infalliable and thus render their opinions immune from critisism
2011-02-11T04:53:08  <antimatroid> i'm right because God said so?
2011-02-11T04:53:14  <sigh> sure
2011-02-11T04:53:25  <antimatroid> i should try that in an exam
2011-02-11T04:53:49  <sigh> :)
2011-02-11T04:53:59  <Frontier> Try to confuse christians with the conciousness and intelligence of apes

2011-02-11T04:55:41  <sigh> don't understand what descendent means?
2011-02-11T04:55:44  <Frontier> Even corvids have more social intelligence than any ant bot I program could ever have
2011-02-11T04:56:19  <Frontier> Our brain and the corvids brain must be descendents of the same ancestor
2011-02-11T04:56:33  <antimatroid> sigh: it is said that we have a common ancestor with the apes of today
2011-02-11T04:56:43  <antimatroid> not that we directly evolved from the apes you see around today
2011-02-11T04:56:47  <Frontier> So we can deduce that reptiles did have a form of social intelligence!
2011-02-11T04:56:58  <sigh> antimatroid: we *are* apes of today
2011-02-11T04:56:59  <antimatroid> i don't know exactly how they classify it, i think the common ancestor was technically an ape
2011-02-11T04:57:26  <antimatroid> sigh: and the same argument for all of evolution
2011-02-11T04:57:28  <sigh> Frontier: things can evolve more than once

2011-02-11T04:57:52  <sigh> :P
2011-02-11T04:58:12  <sigh> for example, eyes are so damn useful, that they have evolved independantly a few times
2011-02-11T04:58:29  <antimatroid> oh, another one is people thinking something evolves something because it would be useful
2011-02-11T04:58:52  <antimatroid> it makes me smirk when someone says an animal has this trait so it can do that
2011-02-11T04:59:07  <antimatroid> no, the animal has that trait because it was a mutation that favoured survival
2011-02-11T04:59:13  <sigh> sure :)
2011-02-11T05:00:00  <antimatroid> we need a multiplayer evolution game
2011-02-11T05:00:01  <Frontier> sigh: I know the difference
2011-02-11T05:01:28  <sigh> antimatroid: that is the main confusion that people have with intelligence, they see it as so obviously useful, they wonder why human levels of intelligence haven't evolved before
2011-02-11T05:01:28  <antimatroid> oh man, n-player game tree's are more complicated than 2 player
2011-02-11T05:01:40  <sigh> antimatroid: yes
2011-02-11T05:02:03  <antimatroid> oh, i remember how i did it
2011-02-11T05:02:11  <sigh> did what?
2011-02-11T05:02:12  <antimatroid> i've done this before, it was messy, but works
2011-02-11T05:02:19  <antimatroid> backward induction on an n-player tree
2011-02-11T05:02:38  <sigh> I haven't done >2 player games
2011-02-11T05:02:54  <Frontier> me neither
2011-02-11T05:03:23  <sigh> either way, even with perfect information you no longer have an optimal plan
2011-02-11T05:03:23  <antimatroid> it's not really any different, pick a player at a node, make moves, at terminal nodes have a payoff for each player, then for a players turn, pick the node that gives the best payoff, given players below are playing "optimally"
2011-02-11T05:03:42  <Frontier> antimatroid cheats. he uses knowledge that is inside his brain and noone else has access to
2011-02-11T05:04:02  <sigh> well, there is the possibility of having an optimal plan if you are so far ahead of everyone else that you can assume that they all act as a single entity and you can still beat them
2011-02-11T05:04:22  <antimatroid> sigh: i don't think you can just treat them as another entity
2011-02-11T05:04:30  <antimatroid> that assumes they are all cooperating against you
2011-02-11T05:04:38  <antimatroid> often you want to cooperate with others
2011-02-11T05:04:50  <sigh> antimatroid: I know, it was a pessimistic prediction
2011-02-11T05:05:06  <antimatroid> my intentions are to use a tree with anything in a specified fighting range, then heuristic everything else
2011-02-11T05:05:10  <sigh> in order to say that you can guarentee a win
2011-02-11T05:05:11  <Frontier> it results in your bot doing nothing agains this overwhelming force ^^
2011-02-11T05:05:35  <sigh> tree to branchy
2011-02-11T05:05:56  <sigh> it will be another heuristic mash
2011-02-11T05:06:04  <antimatroid> i have no idea how to work out your set of possible moves
2011-02-11T05:06:28  <antimatroid> might have to start hashing things and use a decision tree for finding moves
2011-02-11T05:06:28  <sigh> i'll worry about my set of moves, you just worry about yours
2011-02-11T05:06:49  <Frontier> I found a good illustration of that branchy tree: http://www.yellowdartstudios.com/December%20Song.jpg
2011-02-11T05:07:02  <sigh> ah, and the promise of complex algorithms have started already
2011-02-11T05:07:09  <Frontier> Good leaves are scarce
2011-02-11T05:07:29  <sigh> I remember hearing all that at the start of planet wars, and not a quater of that stuff ever for implemented
2011-02-11T05:07:45  <sigh> heh, cool tree
2011-02-11T05:07:46  <antimatroid> what do you two think about passing information? should it be the case that a bot can run without keeping information across turns and is easier to work out information from, or minimise the amount of input?
2011-02-11T05:08:08  <antimatroid> the max information a player could have to receive each turn is width*height rows
2011-02-11T05:08:21  <sigh> ideally bot gets the complete state each turn
2011-02-11T05:08:28  <sigh> unless this is not feasible
2011-02-11T05:08:29  <antimatroid> sigh: this one isn't unrealistic
2011-02-11T05:08:37  <antimatroid> i had the tree with my planet wars bot :p
2011-02-11T05:08:39  <antimatroid> it just sucked
2011-02-11T05:08:50  <sigh> well, you didn't do too bad :)
2011-02-11T05:09:05  <antimatroid> it's a lot clearer for this game, i'd put money on the top 20 bots having a strategy like that
2011-02-11T05:09:19  <sigh> i wouldn't put money on anything
2011-02-11T05:09:22  <antimatroid> i did for the amount of effort i put in :P
2011-02-11T05:09:43  <antimatroid> sigh: you wouldn't put money on anything :P
2011-02-11T05:09:44  <Frontier> OT: Send the whole state information. Fog of war can be just fog. I think people will find a way to remember what was there when they could see it.
2011-02-11T05:09:45  <sigh> I'm sure there were people below you who put in much more effort :)
2011-02-11T05:09:54  <antimatroid> not even the earth to be spinning tomorrow?
2011-02-11T05:10:22  <sigh> I'm still on the fence about that
2011-02-11T05:10:33  <sigh> maybe god will stop it?
2011-02-11T05:10:49  <Frontier> maybe the universe is spinning around us futurama style
2011-02-11T05:10:52  <antimatroid> Frontier: the problem at the moment is, if you walk out of range of say a food square and assume it's still there but it's not when it comes in view again, you are only implicitly told it's not there anymore by the fact that you aren't told there is food there
2011-02-11T05:11:17  <sigh> oh, I don't this that the engine should remember your fog of war for you
2011-02-11T05:11:23  <sigh> *don't think
2011-02-11T05:11:26  <antimatroid> and you are also expected to keep information about where walls are
2011-02-11T05:11:39  <antimatroid> sigh: say what?
2011-02-11T05:11:46  <Frontier> c'mon, you don't see food - there is no food. that's simple :)
2011-02-11T05:11:56  <Frontier> everyone knows that food can disappear
2011-02-11T05:12:00  <antimatroid> i would paint outwards from players and just send them information about any square within view
2011-02-11T05:12:08  <sigh> I don't think the engine should remember what you have seen in previous states
2011-02-11T05:12:17  <antimatroid> sigh: agreed
2011-02-11T05:12:21  <sigh> *previous turns
2011-02-11T05:12:21  <Frontier> sigh: second
2011-02-11T05:12:33  <antimatroid> I will have another go at convincing McLeopold
2011-02-11T05:12:42  <sigh> what does he say?
2011-02-11T05:12:50  <antimatroid> he wants to minimise input amount
2011-02-11T05:12:54  <antimatroid> but i don't think it's expensive
2011-02-11T05:13:10  <antimatroid> it also makes the engine more complicated to store what people have seen etc.
2011-02-11T05:13:18  <sigh> what does he propose for the info?
2011-02-11T05:13:20  <Frontier> antimatroid: What would the other solution to the food problem be? How would you tell a bot that food disappeared?
2011-02-11T05:13:40  <antimatroid> Frontier: his solution is for people to work it out themselves or to not assume it's still there
2011-02-11T05:13:58  <sigh> I think that the bots should just be told what they can currently see
2011-02-11T05:13:59  <Frontier> I don't see the difference right now
2011-02-11T05:14:17  <antimatroid> sigh: input format is on etherpad, basically if you see a square for the first time, you get the info, then you never get sent info for that square again while it's a wall or land
2011-02-11T05:14:18  <sigh> who am I agreeing with?
2011-02-11T05:14:27  <antimatroid> sigh: me
2011-02-11T05:14:38  <sigh> ok
2011-02-11T05:14:40  <Frontier> anyway fog of war makes you unsure of the food item beeing where it was seen last
2011-02-11T05:14:45  <sigh> yes
2011-02-11T05:14:59  <antimatroid> yes, the point is you don't explicitly get told it's not there when you get back in view
2011-02-11T05:15:23  <Frontier> but you get told when it is there?
2011-02-11T05:15:23  <antimatroid> and it's just unecessarily messy to account for that
2011-02-11T05:15:29  <sigh> yeah
2011-02-11T05:15:35  <sigh> always best to keep it simple
2011-02-11T05:15:57  <sigh> ideally you should be able to look at the current state output and have an idea of what's going on
2011-02-11T05:16:27  <antimatroid> with starter bots, i was going to have it reset the map to everything unseeable each turn, then just take info for "seeable" squares
2011-02-11T05:16:40  <antimatroid> that's extremely simple and doesn't present issues about not being given information explicitly
2011-02-11T05:17:16  <Frontier> how would you offset the coordinates?
2011-02-11T05:17:30  <sigh> btw, knowledge of the map gen will allow people to predict the map, right?
2011-02-11T05:17:32  <Frontier> is the rest of the map just 'grey'?
2011-02-11T05:17:35  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-02-11T05:17:47  <Frontier> do you send the 'dirty rect'?
2011-02-11T05:17:59  <antimatroid> i'm confused
2011-02-11T05:17:59  <Frontier> the smallest bounding box around visible tiles?
2011-02-11T05:18:16  <antimatroid> players get sent information on a square per line basis
2011-02-11T05:18:23  <Frontier> or a verbose "row column data" for each visible tile?
2011-02-11T05:19:07  <antimatroid> verbose style
2011-02-11T05:19:21  <antimatroid> it was the entire char map each time, but that might be a bit costly
2011-02-11T05:19:29  <antimatroid> but then again, view radius is quite large
2011-02-11T05:19:40  <Frontier> and consider the parsing overhead
2011-02-11T05:19:41  <sigh> I am in favor of char map
2011-02-11T05:19:54  <antimatroid> sigh: it might be like 200x200 every turn
2011-02-11T05:19:57  <antimatroid> 4000 chars
2011-02-11T05:20:01  <Frontier> 40.000
2011-02-11T05:20:08  <antimatroid> is that still cheap as?
2011-02-11T05:20:10  <antimatroid> yeah, that one
2011-02-11T05:20:12  <sigh> 40kb
2011-02-11T05:20:34  <sigh> you could do bounding-rect like frontier suggested
2011-02-11T05:20:41  <Frontier> consider you see 25% of the map, what would that be in verbose style?
2011-02-11T05:20:55  <sigh> in which case it will usually be more efficient, imo
2011-02-11T05:20:55  <antimatroid> sigh: then you need to provide coordinates
2011-02-11T05:21:20  <antimatroid> some people are going to want to store info across turns, they'd have to pattern match it with that
2011-02-11T05:21:29  <antimatroid> if you didn't give coords
2011-02-11T05:21:33  <sigh> how much info are you sending or verbose mode?
2011-02-11T05:21:42  <sigh> on average per turn
2011-02-11T05:21:49  <antimatroid> no idea
2011-02-11T05:21:58  <antimatroid> http://ietherpad.com/TR0zbEqvx1
2011-02-11T05:22:02  <antimatroid> bot input is right at the top
2011-02-11T05:22:06  <antimatroid> with a sample game just below
2011-02-11T05:23:17  <Frontier> If a line was "23 12 #" (7 bytes), then you are equal with the 1 char per square version as soon as you see 1/7 of the map
2011-02-11T05:23:54  <antimatroid> it's even worse than that too
2011-02-11T05:24:11  <antimatroid> alright, i'll try to get mcleopold back onto just sending the char map each turn
2011-02-11T05:24:23  <sigh> i assume that is why mcleopold only wanted to send info about each square once
2011-02-11T05:24:35  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure
2011-02-11T05:24:43  <antimatroid> next time he's on i'll chat to him
2011-02-11T05:26:01  <sigh> mostly I like char array because it is simple, predictable and human readable
2011-02-11T05:26:25  <Frontier> do we need a visualizer after all? ;)
2011-02-11T05:26:43  <sigh> and I think there are simple ways to compress the fog
2011-02-11T05:26:56  <Frontier> run length encoding?
2011-02-11T05:27:20  <sigh> sure
2011-02-11T05:27:24  <antimatroid> sigh: easy way to encode fog is min/max row/col then pring the coord of the left top square?
2011-02-11T05:27:39  <sigh> yeah, that is simple
2011-02-11T05:27:40  *** mega1 <mega1!~user@catv4E5CABA2.pool.t-online.hu> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-11T05:27:46  <sigh> there are a few options
2011-02-11T05:28:07  <antimatroid> that would make input a breeze too
2011-02-11T05:28:30  <antimatroid> i might even ask for the lower right coords
2011-02-11T05:29:59  <sigh> I think simplest option is to give top-left coord, then print one row per line, with characters up to the last non-fog character
2011-02-11T05:30:08  <sigh> so each line doesn't have to be the same length
2011-02-11T05:30:25  <sigh> then it will still be human readable, and should be quite efficient
2011-02-11T05:30:38  <antimatroid> sigh: more info for the engine to work out and more effort to handle said input
2011-02-11T05:30:50  <antimatroid> why not just print the smallest rectangle containing all visible regions?
2011-02-11T05:30:57  <antimatroid> it would have to still be pretty fast
2011-02-11T05:31:42  <sigh> this is actually easier than working out the bounding rect, for the engine
2011-02-11T05:31:42  <sigh> imo
2011-02-11T05:32:02  <sigh> because you don't need to know the right and lower edges of the bounding rect
2011-02-11T05:32:05  <antimatroid> how? you need to find maxcol for each row?
2011-02-11T05:32:45  <antimatroid> oh wait, nevermind :P
2011-02-11T05:32:48  <antimatroid> hmm, maybe
2011-02-11T05:32:53  <antimatroid> it's less human readable then
2011-02-11T05:33:00  <sigh> just keep printing until you get to the last non-fog
2011-02-11T05:33:03  <antimatroid> well, aesthetically anyway
2011-02-11T05:33:21  <sigh> why?
2011-02-11T05:33:50  <antimatroid> because the lines are of different length
2011-02-11T05:33:53  <sigh> if fog is rendered as a space, then it looks no different at all
2011-02-11T05:34:18  <antimatroid> how do i even read a space character?
2011-02-11T05:34:26  <sigh> ?
2011-02-11T05:34:33  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure c++ skips over it unless you take it as a string then process that
2011-02-11T05:34:39  <antimatroid> how unecessarily gross :P
2011-02-11T05:35:42  <antimatroid> wallter is my new favourite word
2011-02-11T05:36:20  <antimatroid> and then my internet dies again, damnit
2011-02-11T05:37:28  <sigh> you should just be reading the input by line, bit using scanf or whatever it is that skips whitespace
2011-02-11T05:37:28  <sigh> regardless of whether you have spaces
2011-02-11T05:37:28  <sigh> s/bit/not
2011-02-11T05:37:49  <sigh> wallter?

2011-02-11T05:42:12  <Frontier> I would read the line as a whole and then use [] indexing.
2011-02-11T05:42:39  <Frontier> Whitespace skipping is optional on streams as well
2011-02-11T05:42:40  <sigh> Frontier: yeah
2011-02-11T05:43:09  <Frontier> I hope I can try D2 on this contest
2011-02-11T05:43:15  <antimatroid1> sigh: no idea, my "net" often stops loading pages while msn and irc work fine
2011-02-11T05:43:19  <sigh> D2?
2011-02-11T05:43:25  <Frontier> Though I should probably use Python or Lisp
2011-02-11T05:43:25  <antimatroid1> restarting the router fixes it
2011-02-11T05:43:44  <Frontier> sigh: The D programming language version 2
2011-02-11T05:43:44  <sigh> that seem dodgy
2011-02-11T05:43:50  <sigh> oh
2011-02-11T05:43:53  <antimatroid1> Frontier: why read the whole line?
2011-02-11T05:44:03  <Frontier> because it helps the performance
2011-02-11T05:44:46  <antimatroid1> hmmm okay
2011-02-11T05:45:01  <Frontier> if you read a character at a time you have a few more method calls and probaly error checking involved
2011-02-11T05:45:16  <antimatroid1> if i read strings it's effort to pull ints out
2011-02-11T05:45:23  <antimatroid1> unless i throw it into a stringstream
2011-02-11T05:45:26  <antimatroid1> which surely isn't more efficient
2011-02-11T05:45:29  <Frontier> also C++ can check for \n so you don't need to :p
2011-02-11T05:46:19  <antimatroid1> i'm curious as to how the engine sends the states to bots
2011-02-11T05:46:22  <Frontier> how did i solve that?
2011-02-11T05:46:27  <antimatroid1> does player 1 get to start thinking before player 2 etc.?
2011-02-11T05:48:04  <Frontier> oh yes, I did: 		cin >> m_game_state;
2011-02-11T05:48:18  <Frontier> that is way better than anything else
2011-02-11T05:49:25  <Frontier> antimatroid1: There could be threads or the server takes the time from when it started sending the information out
2011-02-11T05:49:51  <Frontier> and later checks if the time is up relative to each bots personal 'start time'
2011-02-11T05:52:49  <antimatroid1> Frontier: I have >> for state, but i still have to write the function
2011-02-11T05:53:33  <Frontier> actually I used a stringstream internally to be able to do a debug print of the whole information block
2011-02-11T05:53:56  <antimatroid1> i just have a Bug struct that has a file stream
2011-02-11T05:54:11  <antimatroid1> and it only actually adds something to a stream if it's got debugging set to true
2011-02-11T05:54:41  <Frontier> :-)
2011-02-11T05:55:38  <antimatroid1> i even used ++ for increment state while resolving moves etc.
2011-02-11T05:55:51  <antimatroid1> and indexing grids with locations etc.
2011-02-11T05:56:02  <Frontier> I didn't have any control about debug code. I used a logger config file to set the level of information in each code module
2011-02-11T05:56:08  <antimatroid1> although i can't index my grid vector inside grid with a location :(
2011-02-11T05:56:46  <Frontier> operator overloading is really nice as long as its function is intuitive
2011-02-11T05:56:51  *** Meatkat <Meatkat!~bovard@41.203.224.168> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-11T05:56:52  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-02-11T05:57:00  <antimatroid1> and awful otherwise
2011-02-11T05:57:30  <antimatroid1> i've used things like |= for merging matrices etc.
2011-02-11T05:57:48  <antimatroid1> merging == augmenting
2011-02-11T05:58:22  <Frontier> I've used ^ for vector cross products
2011-02-11T05:58:40  <sigh> like how intuitive bit-shifting is for stream io -_-
2011-02-11T05:58:41  <antimatroid1> hehe, i still hate not being able to set the precedence of that with matrices
2011-02-11T05:59:07  <Frontier> after all it is shifting data from the stream to some other place
2011-02-11T05:59:09  <antimatroid1> sigh: you say that like i've ever used it for bitshifting :P
2011-02-11T05:59:34  <antimatroid1> i like the <<, >> operators though
2011-02-11T05:59:45  <sigh> I think it is a hack
2011-02-11T05:59:54  <sigh> especially when you try to do formatting
2011-02-11T06:00:07  <Frontier> i don't like >> and pair<int, pair<int, int>>
2011-02-11T06:00:18  <antimatroid1> i hate doing pairs of pairs
2011-02-11T06:00:44  <antimatroid1> i get a little annoyed if i do 4d vectors with initialisation in one line
2011-02-11T06:00:55  <antimatroid1> i pretty much hate pairs altogether
2011-02-11T06:01:05  <antimatroid1> i should be able to index them as [0/1]
2011-02-11T06:01:19  <Frontier> wait.. who wrote the visibility check code today?
2011-02-11T06:01:30  <antimatroid1> which one?
2011-02-11T06:01:33  <antimatroid1> i did the c++ code
2011-02-11T06:01:39  <Frontier> the one with the pairs
2011-02-11T06:01:44  <antimatroid1> me
2011-02-11T06:02:00  <antimatroid1> i will sometimes use them, doesn't mean i like them
2011-02-11T06:09:26  <antimatroid1> Frontier: you wouldn't believe it, but i'm considering assigning ants an id in my bot :P
2011-02-11T06:10:04  <Frontier> O,O
2011-02-11T06:10:43  <sigh> would I believe it?
2011-02-11T06:11:01  <antimatroid1> sigh: i kicked up a fuss about having to ant ids to my old engine for frontier
2011-02-11T06:11:09  <antimatroid1> having to add ant*
2011-02-11T06:11:21  <sigh> ah
2011-02-11T06:12:50  <Frontier> It was a long discussion

2011-02-11T07:26:59  <antimatroid1> Frontier: would that be much faster?
2011-02-11T07:27:24  <antimatroid1> i've not ever seen a lot of that syntax
2011-02-11T07:27:25  <Frontier> no it is the same
2011-02-11T07:27:59  <antimatroid1> yeah, but i'm using vectors and pair's etc.
2011-02-11T07:28:06  <antimatroid1> well, queue
2011-02-11T07:29:06  <Frontier> ok, i guess it is a little faster. but i didnt change the algorithm
2011-02-11T07:30:45  <antimatroid1> i didn't know of foreach
2011-02-11T07:31:17  <Frontier> it is D, but in C++ there is a boost library that adds foreach functionality
2011-02-11T07:31:40  <antimatroid1> have i got this right, if i have a vector<vector<int> >, then foreach(row; matrix) would be like iterating through with each row being a reference to each vector<int>?
2011-02-11T07:31:45  <antimatroid1> ah, okay
2011-02-11T07:31:50  <antimatroid1> i was thinking that was c++ :P
2011-02-11T07:32:12  <Frontier> yes, you got that right
2011-02-11T07:32:35  <antimatroid1> D looks neat there
2011-02-11T07:33:31  <antimatroid1> Frontier: it's a neat little algorithm for filling out who can get where fastest
2011-02-11T07:33:52  <antimatroid1> our whole evaluation function for tron was based around doing that kind of thing
2011-02-11T07:36:32  <Frontier> I looked at some nice animations of the winning tron algorithm
2011-02-11T07:36:56  <antimatroid1> yeah, tron was a good game
2011-02-11T07:46:08  <antimatroid1> ahh, i think i remember how to do back induction on n-player trees
2011-02-11T07:46:13  <antimatroid1> it's a little more costly, but not too bad
2011-02-11T07:47:11  <antimatroid1> you want to back everyone's "payoff" back up, if there is a tie, for each of the non-moving players, bring up the worst payoff from the tieing options
2011-02-11T07:50:47  <antimatroid1> Frontier: http://i.imgur.com/IKtlA.png
2011-02-11T07:51:44  <antimatroid1> you'd have to go back through the optimal path to pull the moves out too
2011-02-11T07:53:15  <antimatroid1> good luck to people also working out how to prune such a beast
2011-02-11T08:02:18  <antimatroid1> i wish i could get a queue to both pop and return that element in the one call
2011-02-11T08:02:43  <antimatroid1> it's the difference to putting brackets around things

2011-02-11T09:28:13  <delt0r_> no
2011-02-11T09:28:16  <antimatroid1> http://i.imgur.com/IKtlA.png
2011-02-11T09:28:30  <antimatroid1> it's messy, but i think that outlines sort of how to do backward induction with n players
2011-02-11T09:29:19  <antimatroid1> basically, pull back payoffs for each player, if there's a tie for the current players children, bring up the worst possible payoff for each of the other players
2011-02-11T09:30:03  <antimatroid1> if it still ties, tie break like you would with 2 player, pick first child or randomly
2011-02-11T09:31:02  <antimatroid1> or you could average the payoffs of the tieing children i suppose
2011-02-11T09:32:30  <delt0r_> what are we talking about?
2011-02-11T09:32:41  <antimatroid1> a game tree with 3 players
2011-02-11T09:32:47  <antimatroid1> each player has two choices
2011-02-11T09:32:58  <antimatroid1> then running backward induction to find the "best" move
2011-02-11T09:33:55  <antimatroid1> start at the bottom and work your way back up to see where the other numbers come from
2011-02-11T09:38:08  <antimatroid1> actually, you do get the "payoffs" if there are no ties, and otherwise the "worst" payoff assuming everyone plays optimally
2011-02-11T09:38:47  <antimatroid1> ah crap
2011-02-11T09:38:54  <antimatroid1> "assuming everyone plays optimally"

2011-02-11T11:26:12  <antimatroid1> what's up?
2011-02-11T11:28:16  <McLeopold> I saw the alternate format.
2011-02-11T11:28:29  <McLeopold> I'm surprised janzert thinks we don't need to compress input/output
2011-02-11T11:28:44  <McLeopold> If that's the case, I would favor sending the map picture everytime.
2011-02-11T11:29:00  <McLeopold> Jeff wanted only the changes sent, so I thought input/output was a priority.
2011-02-11T11:29:28  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I don;t think it will cost that much difference
2011-02-11T11:29:44  <antimatroid1> input really ought to be quite fast compared to other things
2011-02-11T11:30:12  <antimatroid1> i'm unsure about how to do it though now
2011-02-11T11:30:27  <antimatroid1> i don't really like frontiers one, it's too complicated
2011-02-11T11:31:54  <McLeopold> it's really just RLE
2011-02-11T11:32:07  <McLeopold> not as nice for beginners
2011-02-11T11:33:20  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: would it be hard to support both full char maps and current turn input?
2011-02-11T11:33:28  <antimatroid1> then we can see if it does cause much issues
2011-02-11T11:36:47  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: also, i'd probably treat ants walking into walls like a collision if possible?
2011-02-11T11:36:58  <antimatroid1> that would work best with the visualiser
2011-02-11T11:37:00  <McLeopold> no, the order is ignored
2011-02-11T11:37:08  <antimatroid1> hmm okay
2011-02-11T11:37:09  <McLeopold> it's an invalid order
2011-02-11T11:37:26  <antimatroid1> i would have thought given colliding friends die that ant might die as well
2011-02-11T11:37:49  <antimatroid1> either way, people shouldn't be making such a move
2011-02-11T11:37:55  <antimatroid1> so it's not important
2011-02-11T11:39:08  <McLeopold> we could fuse the ants, but it's harder to code
2011-02-11T11:39:49  <McLeopold> I'm marking any square with more than one ant as a conflict, then later for other bot moves, anyone who moves there dies as well.
2011-02-11T11:40:28  <McLeopold> I guess fuse wouldn't be too hard
2011-02-11T11:40:51  <McLeopold> we could just say that only one of your ant's lives, because you confused them into attacking
2011-02-11T11:41:14  <McLeopold> so, do you have some pseudo code for me, on your vision algo?
2011-02-11T11:42:47  <antimatroid1> when you mark a square as a conflict, is that with just ants moving into the square? because you can move an ant into a square that has an ant moving out yeah?
2011-02-11T11:43:16  <antimatroid1> if you did fusion, you might need to work out that info to send to frontier too
2011-02-11T11:43:28  <antimatroid1> i don't mind it being death
2011-02-11T11:43:49  <antimatroid1> umm.. didn't someone say your code was doing what i am for vision radius?
2011-02-11T11:43:50  <McLeopold> I only consider the destination square, so yes, only ants moving there
2011-02-11T11:43:57  <McLeopold> So, ant's can swap places
2011-02-11T11:44:13  <antimatroid1> do you check to make sure an ant wasn't left in a square to which an ant moved into?
2011-02-11T11:44:23  <antimatroid1> or do you "move" an ant when it goes nowhere?
2011-02-11T11:44:52  <antimatroid1> no pseudo code, frontier rewrote it in D
2011-02-11T11:44:56  <McLeopold> I get a list of all destinations.  Ants that don't move are considered to have the destination of where there are.
2011-02-11T11:45:11  <McLeopold> Then I just check for duplicate destinations.
2011-02-11T11:45:29  <McLeopold> So I don't need to considered the order in which the moves are sent.
2011-02-11T11:45:56  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: http://codepad.org/mBrHjLJH
2011-02-11T11:46:04  <antimatroid1> that was frontier's copy of it if it makes any more sense
2011-02-11T11:47:16  <McLeopold> what is ~=?
2011-02-11T11:47:31  <antimatroid1> append that array to the 2d array
2011-02-11T11:47:40  <antimatroid1> (i assume, i have never used D)
2011-02-11T11:49:18  <McLeopold> popBack()?
2011-02-11T11:49:32  <antimatroid1> remove the last element from the 2d array
2011-02-11T11:49:50  <McLeopold> oh, so squaresToCheck.back[0] gets stuff from the array backwards
2011-02-11T11:50:06  <McLeopold> in python, we use negative numbers
2011-02-11T11:50:30  <antimatroid1> hmmm, isn't that a stack?
2011-02-11T11:50:38  <antimatroid1> maybe it's adding things to the front
2011-02-11T11:50:41  <antimatroid1> then taking them off the back
2011-02-11T11:50:58  <antimatroid1> that's not how i think of a queue
2011-02-11T11:51:03  <McLeopold> do you know what TDIRECTIONS should be?
2011-02-11T11:51:15  <McLeopold> and getLocation?
2011-02-11T11:51:20  <antimatroid1> const int TDIRECTIONS = 4
2011-02-11T11:51:26  <antimatroid1> hang on

2011-02-11T11:53:36  <antimatroid1> my getLocation function is like that
2011-02-11T11:54:25  <antimatroid1> Location is just a struct with a row and col variable
2011-02-11T11:55:18  <McLeopold> well, you are only setting visited to true once, but at the cost of all the queue management
2011-02-11T11:55:41  <McLeopold> plus, if you see a fellow ant, aren't you not using his vision too?
2011-02-11T11:56:05  <antimatroid1> the way you scan out, you will see a square visible to the closest ant
2011-02-11T11:56:16  <antimatroid1> any tie and it doesn't matter "who" sees it first
2011-02-11T11:56:33  <antimatroid1> if you marked it as visited once but did each ant sequentially, the algorithm would break
2011-02-11T11:56:40  <McLeopold> okay, I get it
2011-02-11T11:57:00  <antimatroid1> you will want to use that later for seeing who can get where fastest
2011-02-11T11:57:07  <antimatroid1> in your bot
2011-02-11T11:57:17  <McLeopold> not with walls?
2011-02-11T11:57:29  <antimatroid1> you can just not add a wall square
2011-02-11T11:58:01  <antimatroid1> which blocks movement
2011-02-11T11:58:23  <antimatroid1> my tron evaluation function was pretty much, whats the difference in number of squares acceible fastest
2011-02-11T11:58:27  <McLeopold> we could block vision this way
2011-02-11T11:58:35  <antimatroid1> with edge conditions for separating, drawing, winning, losing etc.
2011-02-11T11:58:57  <antimatroid1> block vision with walls? sure, same with fighting, but i think it's more interesting without that
2011-02-11T11:59:34  <antimatroid1> you can see something attractive through a wall and potentially not be able to get there easily
2011-02-11T11:59:48  <antimatroid1> and it makes blocking small regions off harder if people can get you through the walls
2011-02-11T11:59:57  <McLeopold> okay, I'm going to try this in python
2011-02-11T12:00:10  <antimatroid1> i'm going to bed shortly

2011-02-11T12:06:45  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: that's a function to tell me the number of visible squares, it's counting how many squares are "visible"
2011-02-11T12:07:07  <antimatroid1> just get rid of that if you don't want that number
2011-02-11T12:07:11  <McLeopold> oh, but I need a mask

2011-02-11T12:19:32  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: or is that for filling unviewable squares?
2011-02-11T12:19:51  <antimatroid1> can't you mark what is/isn't viewable, and print out a different value depending, or is that costly?

2011-02-11T15:22:28  <Prillicy> anything interesting happen today?
2011-02-11T15:22:42  <McLeopold> I finally understood the vision code

2011-02-11T15:38:15  <Prillicy> do you guys need anything coded?
2011-02-11T15:38:26  <Prillicy> I'd like to learn a little python, and what opportunity to practice right?
2011-02-11T15:38:39  <Prillicy> something small that you just don't feel like doing right now?
2011-02-11T15:40:29  <Prillicy> fine then, I'll try to fix my ide cables and see if I can install linux as a dualboot on my desktop
2011-02-11T15:44:05  <McLeopold> check with amstan, zannick or janzert for tasks.
2011-02-11T15:44:19  <McLeopold> I think amstan wants some site redesign work done.
2011-02-11T15:44:42  <Prillicy> not python, but definitely doable

2011-02-11T15:46:43  <McLeopold> You could also try to write a map generator.

2011-02-11T18:22:51  <antimatroid> and you switch between row,col and y,x in the one program, doesn't that confuse the hell out of you?
2011-02-11T18:37:15  <McLeopold> it did
2011-02-11T18:37:30  <McLeopold> All matrix access is row,col or y,x
2011-02-11T18:37:41  <McLeopold> all tuple locations are col,row or x,y

2011-02-11T20:49:24  <McLeopold> ouch
2011-02-11T20:49:31  <McLeopold> so, who's doing zeta then?
2011-02-11T20:49:33  <Prillicy> that sux
2011-02-11T20:49:48  <janzert> I think jbroman, Zannick and amstan

2011-02-11T20:49:58  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-02-11T20:50:08  <McLeopold> I feel like we don't have direction.
2011-02-11T20:50:24  <McLeopold> I keep working on the engine, cause I never see any other commits to the repo.
2011-02-11T20:50:32  * janzert nods
2011-02-11T20:50:43  <janzert> I certainly understand that feeling
2011-02-11T20:51:07  <antimatroid> i think i'd get in the way more than anything if i tried to help with that stuff
2011-02-11T20:51:16  <janzert> I think jeff needs to hand some ability to finalize decisions off to someone else
2011-02-11T20:51:17  <Prillicy> installer froze at the ubuntu logo
2011-02-11T20:51:42  <McLeopold> maybe, or at least hand out specific tasks
2011-02-11T20:51:43  <antimatroid> i'd nominate amstan
2011-02-11T20:51:54  <McLeopold> amstan always defers to jeff
2011-02-11T20:51:56  <antimatroid> or janzert, but i don't think you want the role
2011-02-11T20:52:02  <antimatroid> amstan: because he has to
2011-02-11T20:52:06  <McLeopold> yeah, I know
2011-02-11T20:52:10  <antimatroid> McLeopold: * :P
2011-02-11T20:52:43  <janzert> yeah, I'm not a good one at this point since I probably won't be involved enough
2011-02-11T20:52:50  <McLeopold> I've got 3 different bots working on stdin/stdout.
2011-02-11T20:52:57  <janzert> sweet
2011-02-11T20:53:07  <McLeopold> I've been ignoring the backend stuff.
2011-02-11T20:53:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: don't do too many before finalising input :P
2011-02-11T20:53:40  <McLeopold> They all share a common class, and the old input is still in there.  The one where you send an ascii picture.
2011-02-11T20:53:42  <antimatroid> i still think the best option is to just print them an entire char map every turn
2011-02-11T20:53:58  * janzert is even unclear if the next contest is suppose to run on epsilon or just go right to zeta at this point
2011-02-11T20:54:04  <McLeopold> I'll have stats on that this weekend, at least for amount of data being passed.
2011-02-11T20:54:12  <jbroman> janzert: Sounds like epsilon to me at this point.
2011-02-11T20:54:13  <McLeopold> It's on epsilon
2011-02-11T20:54:17  <antimatroid> cool
2011-02-11T20:54:20  <janzert> ahh
2011-02-11T20:54:28  <jbroman> janzert: Zeta is next+1 hopefully.
2011-02-11T20:54:29  <McLeopold> jbroman: so, are you doing much work on epsilon right now?
2011-02-11T20:54:33  <antimatroid> i think rushing zeta for this would defeat the purpose of even doing it
2011-02-11T20:54:36  <jbroman> McLeopold: I have done zip to epsilon.
2011-02-11T20:54:56  <McLeopold> is *anyone* besides me working on *anything* ?
2011-02-11T20:55:08  <jbroman> McLeopold: Zannick and I are working on Zeta.
2011-02-11T20:55:11  <antimatroid> McLeopold: everything i'm doing is just about the structure of the game
2011-02-11T20:55:21  <jbroman> McLeopold: And I think Jeff is working on ants stuff, but I don't know.
2011-02-11T20:55:21  <antimatroid> i think frontier is at least contemplating how to do the visualiser
2011-02-11T20:55:29  <McLeopold> okay, that makes me feel better
2011-02-11T20:55:36  <McLeopold> jbroman: did you see my game.py class?
2011-02-11T20:55:49  <jbroman> McLeopold: In passing; it seems similar to my Game class in Zeta.
2011-02-11T20:55:50  <antimatroid> jeff is working on an actual game engine for the server, but i think that's fairly low priority?

2011-02-11T21:08:07  <antimatroid> even with a 2 player non-zero sum game, minimax stops being so great doesn't it?
2011-02-11T21:08:22  <antimatroid> because you aren't actually at complete odds

2011-02-11T21:08:47  <antimatroid> i came up with that example last night trying to work out how to do back induction on an n-player tree
2011-02-11T21:09:07  <janzert> yeah, I suppose it depends on "how" non-zero sum it would be :)
2011-02-11T21:09:11  <antimatroid> but unless everyone plays optimally, your payoff could stil really be anything, you aren't guaranteed at worst what you get out
2011-02-11T21:10:14  <antimatroid> my first thoughts are either minimise the worst case or some kind of regret function
2011-02-11T21:10:22  <janzert> you don't need to be guaranteed the worst case of course, the idea is that you're protecting against it
2011-02-11T21:10:24  <antimatroid> but that might be easier done with a tensor and treating it as it is, simultaneous
2011-02-11T21:11:06  <janzert> but really once you have simultaneous moves you've already invalidated the theoretical backing of it anyway
2011-02-11T21:11:24  <antimatroid> not entirely
2011-02-11T21:11:29  <janzert> of course, as with tron, it may still work out just fine
2011-02-11T21:11:52  <antimatroid> in most cases i think it will work fine, it's when you get no pure strategy nash equilibria, or many that it causes issues i think
2011-02-11T21:12:01  <antimatroid> if there is a single nash equilibrium for something, i think it's all good
2011-02-11T21:13:49  <janzert> yeah, that might be the correct limit
2011-02-11T21:14:08  <antimatroid> that isn't most cases though :)

2011-02-11T22:24:31  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I added current test parameters to etherpad
2011-02-11T22:24:38  <antimatroid> and ascii version of what can be seen
2011-02-11T22:27:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i wonder just how expensive battle resolution 2 might be with lots of ants in vicinity
2011-02-11T22:27:25  <antimatroid> with the larger fight region, it would make option 2 more interesting though
2011-02-11T22:28:00  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-11T22:28:11  <McLeopold> So, I'm thinking we need to crank out the map generators
2011-02-11T22:28:20  <antimatroid> mine works
2011-02-11T22:29:00  <antimatroid> i actually want a larger fight region for option 1 now as well
2011-02-11T22:29:07  <antimatroid> i think birth radius = 1 is good?
2011-02-11T22:29:13  <antimatroid> even for option 2?
2011-02-11T22:29:20  <McLeopold> I figure we need to get to the point where we can release a starter pack similar to last contest.
2011-02-11T22:29:52  <antimatroid> starter packs will be quite simple i think
2011-02-11T22:30:49  <antimatroid> i think everything becomes a lot simpler if people get information for anything they can see each turn, which i think people agree is ideal
2011-02-11T22:31:11  <antimatroid> whether we do that with a char map or the current format we'll see
2011-02-11T22:31:30  <antimatroid> char map also has the benefit of easily being human "readable"
2011-02-11T22:31:31  <McLeopold> well, we would need the main languages, c, c++, java and python
2011-02-11T22:31:48  <antimatroid> is there usually a c starter package?
2011-02-11T22:32:02  <McLeopold> those were the 4 on the page last time
2011-02-11T22:32:06  <McLeopold> I'm not sure
2011-02-11T22:32:10  <McLeopold> c++ at least
2011-02-11T22:32:19  <antimatroid> i can do c++ easily, you can do python, someone else java
2011-02-11T22:32:27  <McLeopold> I can do java
2011-02-11T22:32:28  <antimatroid> jmcarthur could do a haskell one
2011-02-11T22:32:31  <McLeopold> :)
2011-02-11T22:32:58  <antimatroid> but.. i wouldn't worry about that until we've tested out game parameters more
2011-02-11T22:33:35  <antimatroid> although, i guess other than input everything else should be irrelevant to those programs
2011-02-11T22:33:46  <McLeopold> pretty much
2011-02-11T22:34:03  <McLeopold> Even battle resolution doesn't need to affect them.
2011-02-11T22:34:08  <antimatroid> yep
2011-02-11T22:34:13  <McLeopold> They will be stupid starter packs.
2011-02-11T22:34:22  <antimatroid> that is ideal
2011-02-11T22:34:28  <antimatroid> that way beginners can improve right off the bat
2011-02-11T22:34:40  <antimatroid> and it gives them a number of obvious things to get started with
2011-02-11T22:34:44  <McLeopold> I'll be back later...

2011-02-11T22:55:06  <jmcarthur> that we have for all the languages
2011-02-11T22:55:07  <antimatroid> i am planning to write a tutorial to post in the forums
2011-02-11T22:55:10  <jmcarthur> cool
2011-02-11T22:55:14  <antimatroid> but that'll be strategy
2011-02-11T22:55:21  <antimatroid> ^^ thought you were referring to that :P
2011-02-11T22:55:35  <jmcarthur> i was referring to the bare basics
2011-02-11T22:55:51  <jmcarthur> just a way to introduce people to the starters and get them rolling on improving things
2011-02-11T22:56:15  <Prillicy> bare basics: "build bot - upload bot - watch bot kill enemy bots - profit?"
2011-02-11T22:56:20  <jbroman> jmcarthur: I think something in the vein of how Microsoft does their .NET documentation works. (i.e. common body text, but you can choose the language of the code fragments)
2011-02-11T22:56:23  <antimatroid> yeah, with tron, it even gave you a couple of lines of code to add to make the bot instantly better
2011-02-11T22:57:47  <pyro-> do maps wrap?
2011-02-11T22:57:57  <antimatroid> yes
2011-02-11T22:58:19  <antimatroid> it'd be very hard to do fair maps with more than 4 players otherwise
2011-02-11T22:58:25  <antimatroid> and now they don't need to be as symmetric
2011-02-11T23:01:10  <antimatroid> pyro-: http://codepad.org/dLulW3EG
2011-02-11T23:01:14  <antimatroid> that's my current map generator
2011-02-11T23:01:40  <antimatroid> excuse my total lack of knowledge of python
2011-02-11T23:03:20  <pyro-> are those hard tabs i see in your source? that is very difficult to excuse :P
2011-02-11T23:03:50  <antimatroid> what's wrong with hard tabs?
2011-02-11T23:04:09  <antimatroid> do you expect me to push space a lot?
2011-02-11T23:04:16  <pyro-> better to keep to the most commonly accepted standard - PEP8
2011-02-11T23:04:18  <jmcarthur> they are inconsistent in different dev environments
2011-02-11T23:04:23  <jmcarthur> heck no
2011-02-11T23:04:28  <pyro-> no i expect you to use a decent text editor
2011-02-11T23:04:30  <pyro-> that tab expands
2011-02-11T23:04:34  <jmcarthur> if you are using a non-sucky editor you can set it to use spaces when you hit tab
2011-02-11T23:04:37  <antimatroid> i use codeblocks
2011-02-11T23:04:42  <antimatroid> oh, not for that though
2011-02-11T23:04:46  <antimatroid> i used notepad++ :P
2011-02-11T23:05:01  <amstan> pyro-: hey, nice to see you around
2011-02-11T23:05:10  <amstan> antimatroid: you can make it use spaces then
2011-02-11T23:05:19  <amstan> antimatroid: when you press tab it should insert 4 spaces
2011-02-11T23:05:19  <pyro-> antimatroid: style guide: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
2011-02-11T23:05:26  <pyro-> amstan: hello :D
2011-02-11T23:05:47  <pyro-> amstan: will you install ikarus or smt else if i write a scheme starter pack? :D
2011-02-11T23:05:48  <amstan> antimatroid: normally i would go with hard tabs as well, but consistency is always better
2011-02-11T23:06:00  <amstan> pyro-: what's wrong with plt scheme/racket?
2011-02-11T23:06:04  <antimatroid> amstan: sure, i don't mind having tab == 4 spaces
2011-02-11T23:06:15  <antimatroid> slightly annoying for reformatting probably
2011-02-11T23:06:33  <jmcarthur> in emacs when you press tab it cycles the current line through valid indentation levels depending on context :D
2011-02-11T23:06:50  <pyro-> that's a fine implementation as well. in some recent testing i found ikarus to be the fastest is all
2011-02-11T23:07:01  <amstan> what i like about tabs is the easiness to add/remove/navigate between them
2011-02-11T23:07:21  <jmcarthur> the cycling behavior allows you to just not care at all about tweaking them
2011-02-11T23:07:25  <amstan> when i'm between the tab and the code, and i press right, i expect the cursor to go back one indent level, not to be stuck in the middle of spaces
2011-02-11T23:07:26  <antimatroid> pyro-: i don't really care about python :P
2011-02-11T23:07:35  <antimatroid> i do need to keep learning haskell though
2011-02-11T23:08:23  <pyro-> in it's favour plt-r6rs has better standard support than ikarus so w/e. will you install /a/ scheme if i write a starter pack? :D
2011-02-11T23:08:38  <amstan> pyro-: of course
2011-02-11T23:08:41  <pyro-> :D
2011-02-11T23:08:45  <amstan> pyro-: but like.. there's no spec yet
2011-02-11T23:08:51  <amstan> there's no contest yet, we're still deving it
2011-02-11T23:08:59  <pyro-> yep i am getting ahead of myself. impatient man
2011-02-11T23:09:10  <amstan> usually we get a ton of starter packs just after we launch
2011-02-11T23:09:43  <antimatroid> amstan: other than making parameter decisions (including battle resolution) and finalising input, i think the game is pretty much fleshed out
2011-02-11T23:09:59  <antimatroid> input is the only one that matters to the starter bots
2011-02-11T23:10:01  <amstan> antimatroid: we still have to let the protocol cook for a while
2011-02-11T23:10:26  <amstan> antimatroid: is there even a proposal for the protocol?
2011-02-11T23:10:28  <antimatroid> amstan: McLeopold is planning to have a tcp server going at some point for testing parameters etc. on
2011-02-11T23:10:38  <antimatroid> what do you mean by protocol?
