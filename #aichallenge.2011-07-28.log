2011-07-28T14:54:16  <detryo> but implement the equals of the tile
2011-07-28T14:54:38  <detryo> or contains would be fine, since the tile would be the very same object
2011-07-28T14:54:54  <detryo> the equals is implemented
2011-07-28T14:55:03  <detryo> with contains is fine
2011-07-28T14:55:52  <agweber> By using equals I'd have to iterate through the set anyway

2011-07-28T15:49:02  <wonklab> The GameRate seems to be related to how often you get to play a game.
2011-07-28T15:49:19  <wonklab> Where smaller numbers mean you play more often.
2011-07-28T15:51:05  <wonklab> I'm at some ungodly high number so I play a game about once every 2 or 3 hours.

2011-07-28T16:44:01  <mcstar> well, not integer power of two
2011-07-28T16:44:52  <Ira> so, we can have maps  like 63*111 ?
2011-07-28T16:45:03  <mcstar> yeah
2011-07-28T16:45:08  <Ira> ty !
2011-07-28T16:45:25  <mcstar> the only requirement is to provide symmetry for the players

2011-07-28T16:45:32  <mcstar> so the size can depend on the number of players
2011-07-28T16:45:54  <mcstar> i mean there are certain sizes that cant provide a symmetry for a given number of players
