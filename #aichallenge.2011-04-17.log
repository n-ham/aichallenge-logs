2011-04-17T12:11:26  <smiley1983> Is it acceptable for a starter pack to track the turn on which each tile was last seen (if at all) in order to provide the "visible" function, or would this be giving unreasonable help to that starter pack?

2011-04-17T19:41:07  <xavi> hi,may i have  some help about ai game programming(not google aichallange specific)?^_^

2011-04-17T19:44:15  <amstan> xavi: you could just ask
2011-04-17T19:49:33  <xavi> i want to do to an ai challenge with some friends, lets say each one program a method that get a board(tic tac toe) and a symbol(X\O) and return where he wants to play his turn
2011-04-17T19:50:14  <xavi> how i can "connect" the ai's with another program so i can test many users?

2011-04-17T20:05:46  <antimatroid> xavi: take a look at how the engine is done for these contests, it communicates with the bots using standard io
2011-04-17T20:06:15  <antimatroid> if you use c++ i have a Process.h struct I use you might find useful
2011-04-17T20:06:25  <xavi> c#
2011-04-17T20:06:28  <xavi> :S
2011-04-17T20:06:42  <antimatroid> you can have the engine in any language and the bots in any other language too
2011-04-17T20:06:48  <antimatroid> given you're just using normal io to communicate
2011-04-17T20:07:03  <xavi> the only idea i think of is writing to a textfile and using a theard on all ai's that read from it
2011-04-17T20:07:32  <amstan> xavi: look for popen or something similar
2011-04-17T20:07:41  <antimatroid> that's a bit messy, just have an engine that runs each bot
2011-04-17T20:08:11  <xavi> what is the common way to this kind of competition? active the ai's on hte same computer or like a network game?
2011-04-17T20:08:49  <antimatroid> https://github.com/antimatroid/GTL/blob/master/tools/Engine.h
2011-04-17T20:08:49  <antimatroid> https://github.com/antimatroid/GTL/blob/master/tools/Process.h
2011-04-17T20:08:49  <antimatroid> there's an engine and process file i use for my game theory library
2011-04-17T20:09:14  <antimatroid> although note that process struct isn't particularly fast with passing io, but it works
2011-04-17T20:09:47  <xavi> tyvm:)
