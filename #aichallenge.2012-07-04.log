2012-07-04T08:46:00  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: are you interested in a category theory course?
2012-07-04T08:46:14  <antimatroid> there's one on university of reddit which started today

2012-07-04T10:03:17  <antimatroid> mcstar: have you done any abstract algebra?
2012-07-04T10:03:24  <mcstar> ah yeah
2012-07-04T10:03:28  <mcstar> many times
2012-07-04T10:03:33  <antimatroid> are you interested in category theory?
2012-07-04T10:03:40  <mcstar> j/k
2012-07-04T10:03:46  <antimatroid> oh
2012-07-04T10:03:59  <mcstar> my most abstract math was group theory for solid state physics
2012-07-04T10:04:12  <mcstar> and linear analysis for quantum mechanics
2012-07-04T10:04:27  <mcstar> and differential geometry for GR
2012-07-04T10:04:33  <mcstar> so, no, nothing abstract
2012-07-04T10:04:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: id be interested, mainly bc of haskell
2012-07-04T10:05:08  <antimatroid> http://universityofreddit.com/class/36451/
2012-07-04T10:05:09  <mcstar> but im reading about formal logic and stuff atm
2012-07-04T10:05:21  <mcstar> so, i dont think im going to mess with category theory
2012-07-04T10:05:22  <antimatroid> however i dunno how easy it will be to follow without some familiarity with basic algebra
2012-07-04T10:05:30  <antimatroid> just started today though
2012-07-04T10:05:34  <antimatroid> http://www.reddit.com/r/URIntroCategoryTheory/comments/w0phg/lecture_1_course_overview/
2012-07-04T10:05:36  <antimatroid> more on it there
2012-07-04T10:08:27  <mcstar> antimatroid: i dont see a problem with the prerequisites
2012-07-04T10:08:50  <mcstar> ive been reading a bit of cat. theo. from the haskell wikibook
2012-07-04T10:08:50  <antimatroid> the text isn't too hard to find online
2012-07-04T10:09:23  <antimatroid> i have fleshed out the first page of the introduction
2012-07-04T10:09:32  <mcstar> so, this is a Do It Yourself kind of university?
2012-07-04T10:09:34  <antimatroid> it loses me after that, but i don't think i'm meant to understand that yet
2012-07-04T10:09:39  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-07-04T10:10:12  <mcstar> antimatroid: where the lecture note?
2012-07-04T10:10:14  <mcstar> s
2012-07-04T10:10:22  <antimatroid> there's one lecture so far
2012-07-04T10:10:27  <antimatroid> and it doesn't really start on anything
2012-07-04T10:10:30  <antimatroid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu0rj5C2Otg
2012-07-04T10:10:50  <antimatroid> you're not meant to understand wtf he is talking about with the examples he gives
2012-07-04T10:12:47  <mcstar> antimatroid: i meant written lecture notes
2012-07-04T10:12:59  <antimatroid> i don't think there's going to be any
2012-07-04T10:13:07  <antimatroid> ergh
2012-07-04T10:13:09  <antimatroid> i hate that
2012-07-04T10:13:14  <antimatroid> i think there isn't going to be any
2012-07-04T10:13:15  <mcstar> "the text isn't too hard to find online"
2012-07-04T10:13:19  <antimatroid> "i don't think" is an awful expression
2012-07-04T10:13:28  <antimatroid> textbook
2012-07-04T10:13:30  <antimatroid> maclane's
2012-07-04T10:13:47  <mcstar> title?
2012-07-04T10:14:16  <antimatroid> http://www.amazon.com/Categories-Working-Mathematician-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387984038
2012-07-04T10:21:29  <mcstar> i had it
2012-07-04T10:27:47  <mcstar> antimatroid: i dot understand what he means by commute
2012-07-04T10:28:00  <antimatroid> where?
2012-07-04T10:28:10  <antimatroid> commut usually refers to a commutative binary relation
2012-07-04T10:28:15  <antimatroid> ie. one were AB = BA
2012-07-04T10:28:21  <mcstar> i know
2012-07-04T10:28:25  <mcstar> but i cant apply that here
2012-07-04T10:28:29  <antimatroid> where?
2012-07-04T10:28:47  <mcstar> first page of the introduction
2012-07-04T10:28:51  <mcstar> what you said
2012-07-04T10:29:05  <antimatroid> oh sorry
2012-07-04T10:29:08  <antimatroid> commutative diagrams
2012-07-04T10:29:10  <mcstar> he says, the diagram is commutative, if h = f o g
2012-07-04T10:29:39  <antimatroid> yeah, a diagram is commutative if all paths from an object A to another object B correspond to the same function
2012-07-04T10:29:55  <antimatroid> or same arrow if you will
2012-07-04T10:30:20  <antimatroid> like, it doesn't matter which path you take, the resulting function will be the same
2012-07-04T10:30:23  <mcstar> could you give some intuition, why is this called commutative?
2012-07-04T10:30:29  <antimatroid> nope
2012-07-04T10:30:39  <antimatroid> :P
2012-07-04T10:31:01  <antimatroid> it does not imply g \circ f = f \circ g or anything like that
2012-07-04T10:31:11  <mcstar> i know
2012-07-04T10:31:15  <mcstar> but i have an idea
2012-07-04T10:31:20  <antimatroid> ...?
2012-07-04T10:31:32  <mcstar> it isnt applied in the commute ~ interchange sense
2012-07-04T10:31:37  <mcstar> but commute ~ pass
2012-07-04T10:32:06  <antimatroid> yeah that would make sense
2012-07-04T10:32:15  <antimatroid> commute like way you take to work
2012-07-04T10:32:22  <antimatroid> doesn't matter which way you commute to work
2012-07-04T10:32:25  <antimatroid> aha
2012-07-04T10:32:30  <mcstar> something like that

2012-07-04T17:54:35  <jmcarthur> on another note, we at work are playing a game of blotto, so i'm going to write some code to find some good plays for me
2012-07-04T17:55:13  <jmcarthur> should be fun. everybody there knows a variety of relevant topics like game theory, programming, etc., and last year there were something like 175 people that played
