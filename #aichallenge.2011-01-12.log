2011-01-12T19:53:10  <amstan> did you see the one where we fed them?
2011-01-12T19:53:16  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-12T19:53:29  <amstan> ok.. .well.. that's pretty much it
2011-01-12T19:53:45  <jmcarthur> i'm not a huge fan, to be honest. i'm not sure where the challenge would be. it looks like a tough optimization problem, but not a very interesting one
2011-01-12T19:54:16  <amstan> oh.. there's also line of sight stuff
2011-01-12T19:54:20  <jmcarthur> oh?
2011-01-12T19:54:27  <amstan> well.. it will be added

2011-01-12T19:54:58  <amstan> not walls
2011-01-12T19:56:20  <jmcarthur> well, i've been rewriting my tron stuff today. i was finding all my imperative code to be more hassle than it was worth

2011-01-12T19:59:20  <amstan> Frontier: yeah
2011-01-12T20:02:55  <Frontier> Do you know anyone who is good with web design? I find it hard to create a good layout for the ant visualizer. Then again, I didn't want to put more work in it than necessary.
2011-01-12T20:03:54  <jmcarthur> i have a couple friends that do it professionally. i am decent at it too, but i don't like doing it.
2011-01-12T20:04:05  <Frontier> I found the HaxBall football game very promising as well, but it seems like we are setteling for the ant game now.
2011-01-12T20:04:13  <jmcarthur> no we're not
2011-01-12T20:04:22  <jmcarthur> :P

2011-01-12T20:05:08  <Frontier> haha. To me it means more work if the ant game is chosen :o)
2011-01-12T20:05:27  <jmcarthur> honestly, it might be a good thing if i hate the game for the next contest. it means i won't be tempted to participate and i can get more productive things done
2011-01-12T20:05:29  <Frontier> So I have an interest in selecting something else.
2011-01-12T20:06:23  <Frontier> jmcarthur: So what would you like to see next? Hopefully no Tron clone ^
2011-01-12T20:06:31  <amstan> Frontier, jmcarthur: ants is definatelly a game for the future
2011-01-12T20:06:44  <amstan> jmcarthur's tron also seems like a good choice
2011-01-12T20:06:52  <amstan> but they're not set in stone yet
2011-01-12T20:06:54  <jmcarthur> Frontier: my preferred game is a very different tron from the last one
2011-01-12T20:07:19  <jmcarthur> i don't mind the idea of ants, but i don't like what i've seen so far
2011-01-12T20:08:43  <Zannick> we definitely could use more ideas
2011-01-12T20:08:55  <Frontier> And I don't like to go into a competition where others start with adapting their winning entries from last year. The concepts and algorithms for cutting off space from the opponent seem to similar too me. It doesn't excite me at all.
2011-01-12T20:09:05  <amstan> jmcarthur: idk.. me and jeff were blown away by those ants yesterday
2011-01-12T20:09:36  <amstan> Frontier: you cannot realistically apply the same algo from last year on newtron
2011-01-12T20:09:36  <jmcarthur> i'm just not seeing much depth in it
2011-01-12T20:09:48  <jmcarthur> yeah, there's no way the old algos will work
2011-01-12T20:10:03  <Frontier> amstan: What kind of changes did you do to the game? Or what is the difference to the visualizer version.
2011-01-12T20:10:27  <jmcarthur> Frontier: my tron is 3v3 and walls blocks your vision
2011-01-12T20:10:32  <jmcarthur> *block
2011-01-12T20:11:24  <jmcarthur> Frontier: their version of ants is basically simplified
2011-01-12T20:11:45  <Frontier> jmcarthur, amstan: You are probably right, still it feels old and repetetive to me. And others think the same about it.
2011-01-12T20:12:11  <amstan> Frontier: repetitive maybe
2011-01-12T20:12:12  <jmcarthur> Frontier: no hill. come near food and it becomes an ant. come near an enemy and they both die. food spawns randomly.
2011-01-12T20:13:06  <amstan> Frontier: but last contest we had a 600% groth in our users, if only 100% happen for next contest... we'll still have 12 out of 13 ppl who didn't compete in tron
2011-01-12T20:14:00  <jmcarthur> Frontier: maybe once i have this working with some simple bots and you can see it in action you might change your mind
2011-01-12T20:14:01  <Frontier> I didn't compete in tron. That might be the problem for me. :D
2011-01-12T20:14:13  <jmcarthur> IMO, tron was way better than planet wars
2011-01-12T20:14:26  <jmcarthur> it had some glaring flaws though
2011-01-12T20:14:37  <jmcarthur> like everybody converging on the same one or two algorithms
2011-01-12T20:14:45  <jmcarthur> i don't think that would happen with this new version
2011-01-12T20:17:21  <Frontier> Ok, when you have some promotional material ^^ we could put up a poll on the forums for all the ideas we have proven to technically work.
2011-01-12T20:23:16  <Frontier> amstan: You or Jeff can probably use the current visualizer for the ants game without change. Maybe you can even place the ant hills at (-1;-1) or something like that. But only square maps will work.
2011-01-12T20:23:46  <amstan> huh?
2011-01-12T20:23:59  <Zannick> my biggest objection to the ant engine you guys are using right now is that you're using images to define maps
2011-01-12T20:24:04  <Frontier> We have commands to fade in (spawn) or fade out (kill) an ant, movement etc.
2011-01-12T20:24:18  <Zannick> :)
2011-01-12T20:24:29  <amstan> Frontier: what current visualizer?
2011-01-12T20:24:47  <Frontier> Zannick: I have a option for pure grid gfx in mind for you :p
2011-01-12T20:25:14  <Frontier> amstan: Yeah, it loads text files with commands and displays them.
2011-01-12T20:25:21  <Zannick> Frontier: no, i'm talking about the one in the repo
2011-01-12T20:25:34  <amstan> Frontier: what visualizer?
2011-01-12T20:25:44  <Frontier> lol, I'm confused now
2011-01-12T20:25:45  <amstan> we have a gif maker right now
2011-01-12T20:25:51  <Frontier> Is there a 2nd visualizer?
2011-01-12T20:25:57  <amstan> idk.. is there
2011-01-12T20:26:05  <amstan> the only one i'm aware of.. if you can call a visualizer
2011-01-12T20:26:06  <Zannick> which loads a png and bases maneuverability on color
2011-01-12T20:26:08  <amstan> is the makefile
2011-01-12T20:26:30  <amstan> Zannick: actually.. internal python state i think is with an array
2011-01-12T20:26:39  <amstan> @repo
2011-01-12T20:26:40  <contestbot> amstan: repo = https://github.com/amstan/aichallenge/
2011-01-12T20:26:42  <Frontier> gif, png, visualizer, makefile ????? ????
2011-01-12T20:27:47  <amstan> https://github.com/amstan/aichallenge/tree/simpleants
2011-01-12T20:27:52  <jmcarthur> honestly i kind of like using images for maps
2011-01-12T20:28:02  <jmcarthur> makes it easy to make your own maps using gimp or whatever
2011-01-12T20:28:14  <Zannick> amstan: you're reading it from an image, though! :P
2011-01-12T20:28:22  <amstan> Zannick: so?
2011-01-12T20:28:55  <Zannick> it feels like too much overhead to me
2011-01-12T20:28:57  <Zannick> that's all
2011-01-12T20:29:01  <jmcarthur> lol overhead
2011-01-12T20:29:15  <jmcarthur> it's written in python and you complain about the map format? :P
2011-01-12T20:29:23  <amstan> Zannick: so... this is a prototype
2011-01-12T20:29:39  <amstan> just to make sure there's nothing flawed about the rules
2011-01-12T20:29:48  <amstan> jmcarthur doesn't agree with them apparently
2011-01-12T20:29:53  <jmcarthur> i don't think reading from an image implies too much overhead
2011-01-12T20:29:53  <Zannick> i said "my biggest objection"...
2011-01-12T20:30:08  <amstan> it was not made to last, jeff was opposed to even using a repo for it
2011-01-12T20:30:29  <Zannick> i would have gone for a text file for a prototype
2011-01-12T20:30:43  <Zannick> jmcarthur: the image size and the need to use an Image library
2011-01-12T20:30:55  <Zannick> don't worry about it
2011-01-12T20:31:03  <Zannick> i'm just thinking out loud
2011-01-12T20:31:18  <amstan> Zannick: idk.. depending on an image library is meh..
2011-01-12T20:31:37  <jmcarthur> a simpler image format would make it easier to read the image without a library. bmp is pretty simple, for example
2011-01-12T20:32:10  <jmcarthur> or tga
2011-01-12T20:32:15  <jbroman> Alternative: make a tool that converts from (arbitrary image format) -> (map format).
2011-01-12T20:32:15  <amstan> so... why would you write extra code for parsing bmp without a library?
2011-01-12T20:32:34  <amstan> or worse.. write it in python so it's actually slower than pil
2011-01-12T20:32:42  <Frontier> black/white bitmap or tga for example :) - can be viewed in an explorer window and is small
2011-01-12T20:32:42  <amstan> jbroman: hey, what's up?
2011-01-12T20:33:00  <jbroman> amstan: Not much, just lurking mostly.
2011-01-12T20:33:08  <jmcarthur> i am definitely not advocating writing your own when there are existing libraries already :P
2011-01-12T20:33:17  <Frontier> So you want to make it a four player game?
2011-01-12T20:33:19  <jmcarthur> it's just that some people who are not me don't like depending on libraries
2011-01-12T20:34:01  <jbroman> It's easier to port with fewer dependencies. Make the map format simple and close to the obvious internal representation, and then make tools to convert from images (that tool could link against libpng or whatever).
2011-01-12T20:34:04  <Frontier> (Did I mention I wrote an animated gif viewer for DOS in assembly once? ^^)
2011-01-12T20:35:32  <Frontier> Or just use an uncompressed black/white bitmap. Then people can chose to just skip the n bytes of header data and read the image without a lib if they want to.
2011-01-12T20:35:55  <jmcarthur> black and white is insufficient
2011-01-12T20:36:04  <jmcarthur> there are also colors for each starting position
2011-01-12T20:36:07  <jmcarthur> in addition to the walls
2011-01-12T20:36:40  <amstan> jbroman: our platform needs for the engine are pretty limited, we'll mostly use ubuntus, and we did migrate toward using python
2011-01-12T20:38:10  <jmcarthur> well presumably people would also need to run the engine or some version of it locally
2011-01-12T20:38:13  <jmcarthur> for testing
2011-01-12T20:38:35  <jbroman> Yeah, I would tend for a brain-dead simple, no-way-you-could-possibly-screw-it-up format.
2011-01-12T20:39:44  <jmcarthur> a converter from an image format would be a good idea though. it *is* handy to make maps in image editors :)
2011-01-12T20:40:17  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Sure. And you could even throw this tool server-side and make it accept things drawn in an HTML5 canvas or something.
2011-01-12T20:40:29  <jmcarthur> learned from game dev experience :)
2011-01-12T20:40:38  <jmcarthur> abusing image editors
2011-01-12T20:40:58  <Frontier> amstan: I won't be able to provide a visualizer that is anything like http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v3/ for Jeff's version. First of all it is 4x the size in each dimension and second the ants are just points. So there isn't really much I can do but ... draw points ^^.
2011-01-12T20:40:59  <jbroman> Hey, no sense reinventing the wheel.
2011-01-12T20:45:02  <Frontier> ...silence...

2011-01-12T20:53:11  <Frontier> amstan: I just found your forum post with the animated gifs. It looks better than I expected :D
2011-01-12T20:53:25  <amstan> Frontier: you should read the forums more..
2011-01-12T20:54:12  <jmcarthur> for the record, having red dots moving around on a green background doesn't look good on slow LCDs
2011-01-12T21:00:29  <Frontier> What happens when more than one player comes close to a food item?
2011-01-12T21:31:52  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-taelyhegsfhmpkom> has joined #aichallenge
2011-01-12T21:34:45  <jmcarthur> i don't know about what actually happens, but i would guess that the most sensible thing is for both ants to die. maybe the food could disappear as well
2011-01-12T21:38:36  <Frontier> I fear that currently it works top-to-bottom, left-to-right *g*
2011-01-12T21:39:31  <Frontier> Like the top-left most ant will convert the food to a fellow ant and this and will die in a 'battle' with the enemy ant that is on the bottom-right of the former food item
2011-01-12T21:46:16  <pgpaskar_> whoa
2011-01-12T21:46:20  <pgpaskar_> i havent been on the forums for a while

2011-01-12T21:51:13  <pgpaskar_> Weeks.
2011-01-12T21:52:29  <Frontier> jmcarthur: It seems like sometimes the ants harvesting a food item die together with the converted food for no apparent reason. Except that an enemy ant is one step away from the new ant.
2011-01-12T21:53:21  <dmj111> phew ... https://github.com/dougz/trueskill
2011-01-12T21:53:22  <dmj111> it says you need scipy, but I bet it is just for the stat functions.  If so, that is easy enough to get around.  Reading the code now.
2011-01-12T21:55:53  <Frontier> On turn 67 in simpleantswithfood.gif on the left side you see red and white ants approaching a food item and then the food item and a red ant just disappear from the board.
2011-01-12T21:57:46  <sigh> I think one sensible option is to give the food to the closer ant, do nothing if both ants are equally close, in which case they will move closer to the food and annihilate each other :P
2011-01-12T21:59:57  <sigh> either that, or just don't convert the food at all if opposing players are both in range
2011-01-12T22:00:58  <Frontier> So... and what happens when 16 ants of player A circle an ant of player B, sigh? Do you have a smart answer for that, too? ;)
2011-01-12T22:01:39  <sigh> what's special about that scenario?
2011-01-12T22:01:49  <jmcarthur> in typical hollywood fashion they fight one at a time so that the protagonist stands a chance at beating them ;)
2011-01-12T22:02:15  <Frontier> sigh: should all 16 ants of A die? really?
2011-01-12T22:02:40  <Frontier> This is so... Chuck Norris
2011-01-12T22:02:45  <sigh> oh i see... of course only one should die from each side, or none :P
2011-01-12T22:02:57  <Frontier> which one?
2011-01-12T22:03:16  <sigh> if all ants are equidistant, then I can't see anything other than making it random
2011-01-12T22:03:25  <jmcarthur> lame
2011-01-12T22:03:36  <sigh> I can't see a neat solution
2011-01-12T22:03:38  <Frontier> random is a no-go :-)
2011-01-12T22:03:44  <jmcarthur> now... give the ants guns, then they have to shoot each other :P
2011-01-12T22:03:51  <sigh> the other option is to say that no one dies, and that play A has to back off with some ants
2011-01-12T22:04:00  <sigh> *player A
2011-01-12T22:04:14  <jmcarthur> how about if an ant is outnumbered then it doesn't get to take any other ants out before it goes
2011-01-12T22:04:26  <sigh> that seems a bit unfair
2011-01-12T22:04:35  <sigh> it gives advantage to an already strong player
2011-01-12T22:04:47  <jmcarthur> it just means you have to be more cautious in the early game
2011-01-12T22:05:03  <jmcarthur> keep your ants in groups, etc.
2011-01-12T22:05:21  <Frontier> Ok... i had one more question on the forum. wait a moment...
2011-01-12T22:05:31  <Frontier> When there is a string of food items and an ant comes close to it a cascade is started and all the food items in the string convert to ants. How are food items shared between two players that come close to either end of the string?
2011-01-12T22:07:22  <sigh> jmcarthur: have to try it and I guess... what you proposed will promote mirco skills, because with proper micro you can take out ants without losing your own
2011-01-12T22:07:44  <sigh> it could be interesting
2011-01-12T22:09:41  <sigh> if you are smart you can take out a group of enemies using only 2 ants :P
2011-01-12T22:09:43  <jmcarthur> yeah, i didn't think of that
2011-01-12T22:09:56  <jmcarthur> that could be an area that makes the AI actually fun to write
2011-01-12T22:10:09  <sigh> yeah, you hit on a really interesting idea
2011-01-12T22:10:35  <jmcarthur> maybe the same rule could apply to food conversion
2011-01-12T22:10:41  <jmcarthur> convert to the side with the most ants
2011-01-12T22:10:59  <sigh> what about when equal?
2011-01-12T22:11:01  <jmcarthur> that only leave perfectly equal
2011-01-12T22:11:05  <jmcarthur> yeah, dunno
2011-01-12T22:11:11  <jmcarthur> i vote for it to just destroy the food

2011-01-12T22:11:32  <jmcarthur> either that or leave the food alone

2011-01-12T22:11:42  <sigh> I'd rather leave the food alone
2011-01-12T22:11:47  <jmcarthur> if the food just stays then that would encourage more micro

2011-01-12T22:12:33  <jmcarthur> i think this may be the kind of thing i was missing in the ants idea
2011-01-12T22:12:39  <Frontier> Would that be ok for blocks of food, too? I mean what if there is a bunch of 20 food items in one place, all within 2 squares distance from each other.
2011-01-12T22:12:47  <jmcarthur> this makes small decisions potentially big turning points in the game
2011-01-12T22:13:38  <jmcarthur> Frontier: tough
2011-01-12T22:13:42  <jmcarthur> hmm...
2011-01-12T22:13:55  <jmcarthur> maybe it should cascade over multiple turns?
2011-01-12T22:13:56  <sigh> and giving up food is not always bad if you trade for good positioning
2011-01-12T22:14:59  <jmcarthur> a tight wall of ants can hold back a loose swarm of ants without taking any losses
2011-01-12T22:15:12  <jmcarthur> it would become a game of flanking
2011-01-12T22:15:27  <Frontier> *sigh* there goes my visualizer

2011-01-12T22:16:24  <Frontier> minecraft... this is a mania like sponge bob by now.
2011-01-12T22:16:35  <pgpaskar_> To be fair, I don't like minecraft :]
2011-01-12T22:16:42  <jmcarthur> my wife is on the couch next to me playing minecraft right now
2011-01-12T22:16:55  <pgpaskar_> It brings back too much nostalgia from Tribes 2

2011-01-12T22:17:21  <Frontier> Lol, somehow I like the idea of minecraft. I mean... this endless world is just amazing
2011-01-12T22:17:28  <jmcarthur> i like it too
2011-01-12T22:17:36  <jmcarthur> i wish notch would write fewer bugs though
2011-01-12T22:17:45  <pgpaskar_> Hours upon hours spent building the most exquisite and intricate space ships only to have them wiped out by the zombie apoclypse.  somehow it never got boring.... until it stopped working.
2011-01-12T22:18:02  <Frontier> space ships? zombies?
2011-01-12T22:18:04  <pgpaskar_> Except they were spaceships built on land because it was a land game.
2011-01-12T22:18:13  <pgpaskar_> But they had all the glory of something that *could* fly :]
2011-01-12T22:18:38  <Frontier> Was it made of wood or stone tiles? ^^

2011-01-12T22:27:56  <pgpaskar_> dont hate on the construction tool
2011-01-12T22:30:33  <dmj111> i do see a downside in the algorithm though.  Given multiple players, you have to rank them from best to worst, and mark ties.
2011-01-12T22:30:34  <dmj111> Two players who tie, even if they start with the same ratings, don't have the same ratings at end.  They are _close_, but not the same.
2011-01-12T22:32:05  <dmj111> Given A, B, C, D, all starting at mu=25.0, sigma=8.3333, if they are ordered A - D, but B and C tie, here are the results:
2011-01-12T22:32:25  <dmj111> A: mu=31.565  sigma=6.404,   B: mu=24.993  sigma=5.559,  C: mu=25.007  sigma=5.559, D: mu=18.436  sigma=6.404
2011-01-12T22:33:47  <dmj111> for all practical purposes, that is probably fine... that is why we play a lot of games.  unless there are overlords involved.
