2012-05-04T07:50:07  <mcstar> i figured, the guy likes haskell
2012-05-04T07:50:22  <thestinger> hi
2012-05-04T07:50:52  <antimatroid> :P
2012-05-04T07:51:16  <antimatroid> guy seems pretty cool though
2012-05-04T07:51:19  <antimatroid> thestinger: hey!
2012-05-04T07:51:59  <thestinger> my chess implementation has 1000 bugs I need to fix :\
2012-05-04T07:52:11  <antimatroid> how'd you count the bugs? :p
2012-05-04T07:52:17  <thestinger> it's a guess
2012-05-04T07:52:31  <thestinger> ~3 bugs per line of code
2012-05-04T07:52:45  <mcstar> find ./chess -ibugs "*"
2012-05-04T07:52:48  <antimatroid> hehe
2012-05-04T07:53:06  <thestinger> https://github.com/thestinger/chess/blob/master/test.cc#L105 solution will be writing 100000 tests :P
2012-05-04T07:53:34  * thestinger still needs to implement en passant, castling and pawn promotion
2012-05-04T07:53:47  <antimatroid> i'd be curious to do very general ai bots
2012-05-04T07:53:53  <antimatroid> to just play normal form games
2012-05-04T07:54:04  <antimatroid> it's tricky picking out a single pure strategy
2012-05-04T07:54:14  <mcstar> thestinger: are you high on boost?
2012-05-04T07:54:16  <thestinger> I've barely touched the AI part so far
2012-05-04T07:54:18  <thestinger> mcstar: no
2012-05-04T07:54:24  <mcstar> you are
2012-05-04T07:54:24  <thestinger> I picked between cppunit, the google one and boost
2012-05-04T07:54:28  <thestinger> I already had this installed
2012-05-04T07:54:41  <thestinger> mcstar: there is no boost in the actual code
2012-05-04T07:54:46  <thestinger> only the tests because I was lazy
2012-05-04T07:55:15  <thestinger> not going to waste time using strtok_r when I can just use tokenizer.hpp or split.hpp from boost
2012-05-04T07:55:24  <mcstar> seems to be a lot of work, your chess engine
2012-05-04T07:55:38  <thestinger> not really :P
2012-05-04T07:55:50  <mcstar> you are doing it for days now
2012-05-04T07:56:31  <thestinger> I did it all in a few hours, the past few days was just random tweaks + starting on tests
2012-05-04T07:56:46  <thestinger> https://github.com/thestinger/chess/commit/73a197d8f52aac7a56adbfbdbec6b3c61b0e80c1
2012-05-04T07:57:04  <mcstar> "the past few days was just random tweaks + starting on tests"
2012-05-04T07:57:08  <mcstar> well, yeah
2012-05-04T07:57:10  <mcstar> a long time
2012-05-04T07:57:33  <mcstar> you cant really take these things apart when you count development time
2012-05-04T07:57:47  <thestinger> but I haven't been working on it much at all
2012-05-04T07:58:07  <thestinger> it was ~3 hours for the buggy incomplete implementation, ~3 to get the AI working sort of okay the next day
2012-05-04T07:58:17  <thestinger> and I've been too lazy to figure out what to do next
2012-05-04T07:58:23  <thestinger> so I just changed a bunch of ints to unsigned
2012-05-04T07:59:06  <thestinger> there are fundamental problems with the implementation so I need to figure those out before I can fix stuff
2012-05-04T07:59:49  <mcstar> ive been trying to get working the monodevelop plugin for f#
2012-05-04T07:59:55  <mcstar> its a mess
2012-05-04T08:00:02  <mcstar> and cabal too
2012-05-04T08:00:17  <thestinger> mcstar: I did waste a _huge_ amount of time playing against it :P
2012-05-04T08:00:30  <thestinger> and reading random stuff about chess
2012-05-04T08:00:45  <mcstar> are you good at chess?
2012-05-04T08:00:52  <mcstar> at or in?
2012-05-04T08:01:02  <thestinger> I haven't really ever put much time into it
2012-05-04T08:01:07  <thestinger> so I'd say definitely no
2012-05-04T08:01:35  <mcstar> ExitFailure 1
2012-05-04T08:01:45  <mcstar> im seeing this a lot today
2012-05-04T08:01:55  <mcstar> stupid gtk things are broken too
2012-05-04T08:02:02  <mcstar> gtksourceview2
2012-05-04T08:02:07  <thestinger> I just ended up using the boost unit tests because they work like python-nose
2012-05-04T08:02:19  <thestinger> and I didn't need to read any docs :P
2012-05-04T08:02:29  <thestinger> #define BOOST_TEST_MAIN
2012-05-04T08:02:39  <thestinger> and then make BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE functions
2012-05-04T08:02:43  <thestinger> (well, macros)
2012-05-04T08:03:57  <mcstar> sorry thestinger i havent written 1 single unit test
2012-05-04T08:04:27  <mcstar> i look at the code as long as im not convinced it is ok
2012-05-04T08:04:32  <thestinger> mcstar: want to write a few thousand for me? :P
2012-05-04T08:04:46  <mcstar> ah, no thanks
2012-05-04T08:05:15  <mcstar> im taking a break from a bigg ass article
2012-05-04T08:05:18  <thestinger> I need to figure out profiling
2012-05-04T08:05:37  <thestinger> valgrind's callgrind tool is nice but it takes forever to run
2012-05-04T08:05:55  <mcstar> try smaller problems
2012-05-04T08:06:08  <mcstar> i dont think there is a better one
2012-05-04T08:06:25  <thestinger> and I needed to install all of KDE to get the sane UI for it >.<
2012-05-04T08:06:27  <mcstar> and theres a gui to view the results...
2012-05-04T08:06:45  <thestinger> all it did was confirm what I already knew
2012-05-04T08:06:59  <mcstar> kdebase-runtime
2012-05-04T08:07:27  <mcstar> and kdelibs
2012-05-04T08:07:30  <mcstar> thats not much
2012-05-04T08:07:52  <mcstar> anyway, why are you profiling?
2012-05-04T08:08:02  <mcstar> it is not even bugfree
2012-05-04T08:08:52  <thestinger> mcstar: I was just figuring out the best profiler
2012-05-04T08:08:54  <thestinger> because I will need to
2012-05-04T08:09:11  <thestinger> mcstar: http://sprunge.us/ZAVc
2012-05-04T08:09:58  <mcstar> most of that is not kde
2012-05-04T08:10:06  <thestinger> things kde needs
2012-05-04T08:10:36  <thestinger> I already have qt, etc.
2012-05-04T08:10:37  <mcstar> yeah, but not kde
2012-05-04T08:10:40  <thestinger> those deps are ridiculous :P
2012-05-04T08:10:58  <mcstar> why did you chose phono-vlc?
2012-05-04T08:11:05  <mcstar> oo
2012-05-04T08:11:40  <thestinger> gstreamer is just as bad
2012-05-04T08:11:57  <mcstar> but you have it already, dont you?
2012-05-04T08:11:59  <thestinger> no
2012-05-04T08:12:15  <mcstar> cmus needs it
2012-05-04T08:12:23  * thestinger uses mplayer2 and mpd
2012-05-04T08:12:52  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vZG04dQ it's not like I have a slim system
2012-05-04T08:13:17  <thestinger> but I don't like having dozens of useless dotfiles and userspace daemons
2012-05-04T08:13:51  <thestinger> oh I shouldn't have left the stupid dep compression on
2012-05-04T08:13:59  <thestinger> makes it look like cabal-install is the devil
2012-05-04T08:19:35  <mcstar> im gonna take a break from computers
2012-05-04T08:20:35  <thestinger> that sounds too productive

2012-05-04T10:40:12  <mcstar> antimatroid: i bet you can solve the collatz conjecture first
2012-05-04T10:40:26  <mcstar> or another millenium prize problem
2012-05-04T10:40:42  <antimatroid> mostly different interests anyway
2012-05-04T10:40:57  <antimatroid> although we've done very similar units the whole way through
2012-05-04T10:41:12  <mcstar> what is his field?
2012-05-04T10:41:17  <antimatroid> he did eco, finance and maths in undergrad but has also done all the algo units and knew how to program etc. before uni
2012-05-04T10:41:21  <antimatroid> started uni at like 16
2012-05-04T10:41:43  <antimatroid> not sure what he's planning for post grad now, he was torn between algebra and mathematical finance
2012-05-04T10:41:57  <antimatroid> i'll talk to him more when he's online in the morning
2012-05-04T10:42:19  <antimatroid> i've been trying not to prod him too much cause i don't think he was sure of what he was going to do, which is a little daunting from my experience
2012-05-04T10:42:39  <antimatroid> he's been looking at group extensions lately
2012-05-04T10:43:06  <mcstar> has he published?
2012-05-04T10:43:10  <antimatroid> nope
2012-05-04T10:43:27  <antimatroid> he has submitted with one of the eco people at my uni a couple of times but it's been sent back for adjustments or wahtever
2012-05-04T10:43:38  <antimatroid> well, mardi who i did some ra work for too
2012-05-04T10:43:45  <antimatroid> but he's found more time for it than i ever did
