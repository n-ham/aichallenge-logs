2011-11-19T02:45:34  <antimatroid> i'll pretty much be using the turn limit each turn
2011-11-19T02:46:04  <bmh> antimatroid: game trees? As in you'll be doing A-B pruning?
2011-11-19T02:46:22  <antimatroid> haven't done it yet but the plan is to use game trees for battles
2011-11-19T02:46:35  <antimatroid> i might try and do some kind of pruning with an n-player tree
2011-11-19T02:46:42  <antimatroid> and backward induction on that to pick move
2011-11-19T02:46:43  <antimatroid> s
2011-11-19T02:47:15  <antimatroid> i would do me vs. rest and assume they are ganging up on me but one might be able to prune better if you treat it as n-player
2011-11-19T02:47:21  <antimatroid> i haven't gone through and worked out all the details yet
2011-11-19T02:47:38  <thestinger> what about big battles?
2011-11-19T02:47:51  <antimatroid> max size for each battle partition :)
2011-11-19T02:47:56  <antimatroid> then just do them incrementally
2011-11-19T02:48:01  <antimatroid> not sure what else to do about it
2011-11-19T02:48:49  <bmh> the only strategy that still makes any sense to me is to have a LOS ring around my hill, anoint everyone within the ring as a forager and everyone on the ring as a fighter
2011-11-19T02:48:58  <thestinger> I'm trying to get really basic combat logic working well and very fast and then I'll do a proper implementation which will try to do as much as possible in the remaining time
2011-11-19T02:49:01  <bmh> then grow the ring while minimizing forager density
2011-11-19T02:52:17  <thestinger> my bot is terrible at foraging on large open maps :(
2011-11-19T02:52:32  <bmh> how do you forage?
2011-11-19T02:53:18  <thestinger> atm I just revisit locations that haven't been seen in a while (they slowly gain weight the longer I haven't seen them)
2011-11-19T02:53:28  <thestinger> it's terrible on the open maps because my ants spread out way too far
2011-11-19T02:53:38  <bmh> and then get zerged?
2011-11-19T02:53:45  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-19T02:54:02  <thestinger> they just get picked off and I forage slower than the other bots most of the time
2011-11-19T02:54:10  <bmh> what weight do you assign to squares you've never seen?
2011-11-19T02:54:40  <thestinger> exploration is basically separate from foraging
2011-11-19T02:55:57  <bmh> ok, so you're only weighting squares you've seen. Do you end up with a surplus of ants? got any fluxid links?
2011-11-19T02:56:26  <thestinger> well, my surplus ants will explore/attack
2011-11-19T02:56:41  <bmh> I mean, do you end up with ants in the birthing queue?
2011-11-19T02:56:47  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_combatzones there's my current bot
2011-11-19T02:57:05  <thestinger> foraging is definitely a major weak point :)
2011-11-19T02:57:43  <bmh> your fighting looks solid
2011-11-19T02:57:44  <thestinger> on 2-player maze maps there's the illusion that it works well b/c trading ants with the opponent is fine
2011-11-19T02:57:52  <thestinger> I assume enemies don't move atm
2011-11-19T02:58:13  <thestinger> so if they're cautious, it works
2011-11-19T02:58:22  <thestinger> if they just run around unaware of combat, my ants basically do the same :P
2011-11-19T02:58:43  <bmh> I still don't get combat. The explanation in the 'specific' seems incoherent

2011-11-19T03:00:07  <bmh> reading codeâ€¦ pah
2011-11-19T03:00:54  <thestinger> I basically turned the python code at the bottom into a simulate() function that lets me see which ants will die in a situation
2011-11-19T03:01:15  <thestinger> just had to rewrite it in C++ and change it a tiny bit
2011-11-19T03:01:19  <bmh> they should stick the 'math' at the top. It's actually very clear.
2011-11-19T03:01:38  <thestinger> yeah, the math/pseudo-code is very clear

2011-11-19T03:32:05  <antimatroid> has anyone thought much about pruning n player game trees?
2011-11-19T03:32:36  <delt0r_> well since there is no way you can get close to working out what optimal is with the recourses you have... i have my doubts
2011-11-19T03:33:05  <antimatroid> i can work out a pruning method if i assume players are playing optimally
2011-11-19T03:33:07  <delt0r_> first of all you would need global state
2011-11-19T03:33:10  <antimatroid> but i don't think that's a very good assumption
2011-11-19T03:33:34  <delt0r_> you can't work out what a optimal move is... so i don't think so...
2011-11-19T03:33:48  <delt0r_> unless you define optimal as some non optimal whatever
2011-11-19T03:33:51  <antimatroid> define optimal move?
2011-11-19T03:34:10  <delt0r_> maximizes the final point outcome

2011-11-19T03:34:21  <antimatroid> one didn't get optimal moves using a game tree in tron but you still got bloody good ones
2011-11-19T03:34:40  <delt0r_> there is no hidden state in that game
2011-11-19T03:34:47  <delt0r_> there is alway far less state
2011-11-19T03:34:51  <delt0r_> also
2011-11-19T03:35:16  <delt0r_> lossing ants in a 1:1 ratio is optimal at some stages of the game
2011-11-19T03:35:19  <delt0r_> or even worse
2011-11-19T03:35:56  <antimatroid> yeah but that's a matter of tweaking the evaluation function
2011-11-19T03:36:13  <antimatroid> i still want a way to prune the tree so that i can maximise the number of ants i can do in each battle partition
2011-11-19T03:36:41  <delt0r_> I have just use a trail method only one move ahead
2011-11-19T03:36:55  <delt0r_> its working ok... not debuged enough for live yet
2011-11-19T03:37:42  <delt0r_> as in i cluster ants that could die/kill next turn... then try everything --hope to hell the clusters are small enough
2011-11-19T03:37:50  <delt0r_> i can of course cap the clusters
2011-11-19T03:38:07  <antimatroid> new plan, back to two player zero sum
2011-11-19T03:38:12  <antimatroid> i'm going to force it to fit that
2011-11-19T03:38:22  <delt0r_> you and your game theory ;D
2011-11-19T03:39:18  <delt0r_> I did potential maps!
2011-11-19T03:39:23  <delt0r_> it kinda works...
2011-11-19T03:39:43  <delt0r_> the problem always is global stratagy... ie defend your nest idiots!
2011-11-19T03:40:09  <delt0r_> Or just *charge* death and Glory...
2011-11-19T03:40:50  <antimatroid> game theory rules
2011-11-19T03:40:57  <antimatroid> i think i have something kind of decent to go on here actually :D
2011-11-19T03:41:05  <antimatroid> i'll try and write up a game tree tonight
2011-11-19T03:41:08  <antimatroid> and get battles going
2011-11-19T03:41:48  <delt0r_> trees have timeout isses
2011-11-19T03:41:57  <delt0r_> so i hope you can write fast C++
2011-11-19T03:42:04  <delt0r_> which is not that easy IMO
2011-11-19T03:42:55  <antimatroid> i do a game tree iteratively
2011-11-19T03:43:00  <antimatroid> and stop once i run out of time
2011-11-19T03:43:14  <antimatroid> then make a decision based off what is generated
2011-11-19T03:43:26  <antimatroid> although in this game i intend to do multiple trees for multiple battle partitions
2011-11-19T03:43:36  <antimatroid> and cap the number of ants that can be in each battle partition
2011-11-19T03:44:24  <delt0r_> yea... but the final performance will depend on how much of the tree space you get to "see" so faster code will make a big difference
2011-11-19T03:44:44  <delt0r_> aka chess programs in the amiga days vers now!
2011-11-19T03:44:50  <delt0r_> ok little extreme

2011-11-19T06:06:08  <Fluxid> i think to replace my method of exploration and keeping stuff visible with something completely different, only based on keeping ant density across whole map equal
2011-11-19T06:07:14  <Anilm3> atleast you have an idea...
2011-11-19T06:07:28  <Fluxid> rough one

2011-11-19T06:27:33  <seletskiy> Hello. Does anyone has same issue: every game always ends in timeout for my bot. I've using python3 and check in every iteration that I've have enough time to do decision (e.g. time_remaining() > 50). And it everytime goes into timeout. On my local machine everything works well even with smaller turn time.
2011-11-19T06:28:29  <Yexo> seletskiy: is that on the official servers or on a tcp server?
2011-11-19T06:28:40  <Fluxid> seletskiy: you use turntime you get from manager, right?
2011-11-19T06:28:40  <seletskiy> Yexo: official server
2011-11-19T06:28:46  <seletskiy> Fluxid: yes
2011-11-19T06:28:57  <Yexo> do you flush stdout after every turn?
2011-11-19T06:29:44  <seletskiy> Yexo: yes, I've using API from starter package for python3

2011-11-19T07:28:49  <mcstar> but turned out my evaluation function is very costly
2011-11-19T07:29:01  <mcstar> its the same battle resolution as the one in ants-fight
2011-11-19T07:29:02  <antimatroid1> ohh, i hope mine isn't too bad
2011-11-19T07:29:20  <mcstar> so i have to tweak that
2011-11-19T07:29:26  <antimatroid1> what do you do? i track which ants i've moved then find ants that are battling based off those locations
2011-11-19T07:29:45  <antimatroid1> then work out outcomes like razed hills and number of friend/enemy ant deaths
2011-11-19T07:29:46  <mcstar> well thats too general
2011-11-19T07:29:49  <antimatroid1> and order state outcomes
2011-11-19T07:29:52  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-19T07:29:54  <mcstar> wait
2011-11-19T07:30:09  <mcstar> well yeah
2011-11-19T07:30:20  <mcstar> thats basically enumerating outcomes
2011-11-19T07:30:31  <antimatroid1> yeah
2011-11-19T07:30:46  <antimatroid1> so i'm setting it up like a kind of 1-ply minimax of me vs them
2011-11-19T07:31:08  <mcstar> if((len-mineCount)>0 and len<=5)
2011-11-19T07:31:11  <antimatroid1> where 1st layer has non-colliding moves from some of my ants and 2nd layer has non-friendly colliding moves from some enemy ants
2011-11-19T07:31:15  <mcstar> this is when my battle code kicks in
2011-11-19T07:31:35  <antimatroid1> and i don't bother checking states if alpha-beta would prune them
2011-11-19T07:31:54  <mcstar> alpha-beta sort of lost its meaning here
2011-11-19T07:32:03  <antimatroid1> i don't think it has how i've set it up
2011-11-19T07:32:06  <mcstar> the tree is tooo shallow
2011-11-19T07:32:35  <mcstar> you consider different player moves as different plies, sort of
2011-11-19T07:32:37  <mcstar> right?
2011-11-19T07:32:43  <antimatroid1> can still help skip checking outcomes for lots of states when doing enemy moves
2011-11-19T07:33:11  <antimatroid1> first layer is my ants non-colliding moves, second layer is enemy ants moves where friendly enemy ants don't collide
2011-11-19T07:33:38  <mcstar> i want a different optimization
2011-11-19T07:33:47  <mcstar> i dont know if i should say it
2011-11-19T07:33:52  <antimatroid1> then i sort of go through that dfs style and don't bother running the simulation if alpha beta would throw it out already
2011-11-19T07:33:58  <mcstar> lets go private
2011-11-19T07:34:02  <antimatroid1> :p
2011-11-19T07:35:05  <UncleVasya> I do it near the same way:
2011-11-19T07:35:16  <UncleVasya> 1. Generate my [possible moves.
2011-11-19T07:35:40  <UncleVasya> 2. For every my move generate enemy moves (here the alpha-beta is involved).
2011-11-19T07:38:31  <UncleVasya> If material evaluation is the same, I use position evaluation.
2011-11-19T07:40:01  <UncleVasya> If my_battle_ants count >= enemy_battle_ants count then I try to come closer, else to step back.
2011-11-19T07:40:27  <UncleVasya> Also I plan to use super_move and good_ove prunning.
2011-11-19T07:41:34  <mcstar> yep i sum up those variables for every move of mine
2011-11-19T07:41:36  <mcstar> and decide
2011-11-19T07:41:45  <mcstar> but my becomes very defensive
2011-11-19T07:41:57  <mcstar> for example i turned everything off after turn 100
2011-11-19T07:41:59  <mcstar> so i get many ants
2011-11-19T07:42:08  <mcstar> and watched how it evades the attacking ants
2011-11-19T07:42:18  <mcstar> it was very interesting

2011-11-19T09:00:35  <Fluxid> so i started to recompile stuff with debugging symbols (i have gentoo) but then it stopped to crash!
2011-11-19T09:01:02  <delt0r_> Fluxid: yea happens a lot... to do with how much more bad pointers you can get away with in a debug build

2011-11-19T09:05:52  <grwip> i.e. you start on a cell, then goes to the lowest one in the neighborhood, and reiterate until you can't move anymore
2011-11-19T09:06:27  <mcstar> i need maek mkae mkea commands besides make
2011-11-19T09:06:31  <jix> argh just after that rewrite I have an even better idea for gathering food
2011-11-19T09:06:49  <Fluxid> grwip: ok, i understand this in 2d
2011-11-19T09:06:51  <Fluxid> 1d
2011-11-19T09:07:04  <Fluxid> but no idea how to optimally apply this to 2d
2011-11-19T09:07:11  <Fluxid> maybe i'll google this first
2011-11-19T09:07:46  <mcstar> Fluxid: there is not much to google
2011-11-19T09:07:48  <grwip> Fluxid: in 2d you have 8 or 4 neighbors (depending on the connectivity you choose) instead of 2 in 1d I guess
2011-11-19T09:08:02  <mcstar> that is a good way to find local minimums from a starting position
2011-11-19T09:08:09  <mcstar> minima*
2011-11-19T09:08:28  <delt0r_> the only way to find global is by checking everything
2011-11-19T09:08:45  <mcstar> yeah, loop over row and col
2011-11-19T09:08:56  <delt0r_> its fast for 100x100
2011-11-19T09:09:12  <delt0r_> or even a bit bigger
2011-11-19T09:09:12  <mcstar> Fluxid: of course you can compute partial derivatives
2011-11-19T09:09:40  <grwip> max map size is 256x256, I guess even for that iterating through each cell is really fast
2011-11-19T09:10:21  <mcstar> Fluxid: if your function behaves nicely, i.e. smooth enough, you might not want to "pixelate" it
2011-11-19T09:10:33  <mcstar> and just do it analytically
2011-11-19T09:10:37  <grwip> mcstar: nice idea
2011-11-19T09:11:07  <grwip> mcstar: would converge faster right?
2011-11-19T09:11:26  <mcstar> converge?
2011-11-19T09:11:39  <grwip> to the local minima
2011-11-19T09:11:39  <grwip> *minimum
2011-11-19T09:12:07  <mcstar> you mean like a conjugate gradient method?
2011-11-19T09:12:18  <mcstar> that would be fast yes
2011-11-19T09:12:39  <grwip> hmm, maybe I just don't understand what you mean by analytically
2011-11-19T09:13:09  <mcstar> i dont know what is his function that he evaluates at the grid points
2011-11-19T09:13:23  <mcstar> he can do it fully analytically
2011-11-19T09:13:55  <Fluxid> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3684484/peak-detection-in-a-2d-array
2011-11-19T09:14:13  <mcstar> or he can write the \partial_x f(), \partial_y f() to the borad
2011-11-19T09:14:15  <mcstar> board*
2011-11-19T09:14:24  <mcstar> and look for double 0's
2011-11-19T09:14:34  <mcstar> and get all the local minimas by one sweep of the board
2011-11-19T09:14:45  <mcstar> so there are many possibilities
2011-11-19T09:15:04  <Fluxid> mcstar, grwip i stopped to understand after partial derivatives
2011-11-19T09:15:12  <Fluxid> i need to read on terms
2011-11-19T09:15:42  <grwip> mcstar: ok I see know
2011-11-19T09:16:57  <grwip> Fluxid: if it's for some kind of influence map and you just want to find the nearest peak for a particular ant then I guess the pseudo "gradient descent" I described before should run well
2011-11-19T09:17:07  <mcstar> Fluxid: probably the easies is to check every pixel, if it is lower than all of its nbors, it is a local minimum
2011-11-19T09:17:20  <mcstar> thats all there is to it
2011-11-19T09:17:34  <Fluxid> mcstar: problems - there can be blobs of equal values
2011-11-19T09:17:43  <mcstar> so?
2011-11-19T09:17:48  <mcstar> that is not a local minimum
2011-11-19T09:18:09  <Fluxid> hm, right
2011-11-19T09:18:15  <mcstar> there would be trouble with the derivatives in an analytical sense
2011-11-19T09:18:23  <mcstar> so it would lost its meaning
2011-11-19T09:18:32  <mcstar> but you can apply a little noise to it
2011-11-19T09:18:59  <mcstar> it really depends on what you are plannign to do with the extracted values
2011-11-19T09:19:04  <mcstar> what is the prupose of all this
2011-11-19T09:19:12  <mcstar> so pick the right one
2011-11-19T09:19:15  <Fluxid> then, in ants terms - i need to find edges to the "blobs" of lowest values in area
2011-11-19T09:19:51  <Fluxid> edges are no problem, but what about blobs ;)
2011-11-19T09:20:11  <grwip> flood algorithm?
2011-11-19T09:20:13  <Fluxid> i thought that what i want to do would be simpler
2011-11-19T09:20:18  <mcstar> are you adding manhattan distance from multiple sources?
2011-11-19T09:20:43  <Fluxid> mcstar: what do you mean?
2011-11-19T09:21:15  <mcstar> board[row,col]=md(pos1,row,col)+md(pos2,row,col)+...
2011-11-19T09:21:40  <mcstar> because this leads to regions of equal values
2011-11-19T09:21:45  <mcstar> just a guess
2011-11-19T09:25:08  <Fluxid> yeah, a rather complicated flood fill could do it...
2011-11-19T09:26:15  <mcstar> we still dont know WHAT it could do
2011-11-19T09:26:21  <mcstar> not that i want you to tell me
2011-11-19T09:26:31  <mcstar> its just hard to help if you dont know the parameters
2011-11-19T09:26:33  <Fluxid> mcstar: i'm afraid i'm not able to explain
2011-11-19T09:26:39  <mcstar> k
2011-11-19T09:27:12  <Fluxid> i'm bad with words in my native language, and i'm worse in english so..
2011-11-19T09:27:45  <mcstar> where are you from?
2011-11-19T09:28:09  <mcstar> italy?
2011-11-19T09:28:56  <Fluxid> i'd flood fill from one position, when i find a lower value i "cancel" all the filled cells and further filling of given value, and continue filling the lower value...
2011-11-19T09:29:00  <Fluxid> mcstar: poland
2011-11-19T09:29:11  <mcstar> ants.fluxid.pl, im stupid
2011-11-19T09:29:16  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-11-19T09:29:54  <mcstar> Fluxid: thats not a compilcated alg
2011-11-19T09:29:56  <mcstar> i have it too
2011-11-19T09:30:06  <mcstar> and i have a more complicated version of it
2011-11-19T09:30:15  <mcstar> it just coputes the voronoi regions
2011-11-19T09:30:20  <mcstar> computes*
2011-11-19T09:30:28  <mcstar> by a given distanec metric
2011-11-19T09:31:19  <Fluxid> but then i thought if i want to move ants to area of lower density... there will be local minimum between three ants close to each other, so those ant would be attracted to each other, ignoring larger blobs of seriously unhabited areas
2011-11-19T09:32:00  <mcstar> i see
2011-11-19T09:32:08  <mcstar> i useit for a completely different purpose
2011-11-19T09:32:15  <mcstar> not for exploration
2011-11-19T09:33:07  <Fluxid> so i need a way to determine if given minimum is interesting... or maybe i'll just look for global minimum
2011-11-19T09:33:12  <grwip> mcstar: what method do you use for exploration?
2011-11-19T09:33:24  <Fluxid> daaaamn, it's all useless, along with my c extension
2011-11-19T09:33:30  <mcstar> :(
2011-11-19T09:33:40  <mcstar> grwip: first i used diffusion
2011-11-19T09:33:47  <mcstar> but i dont anymoew
2011-11-19T09:33:51  <mcstar> re
2011-11-19T09:33:52  <grwip> mcstar: I use that now
2011-11-19T09:33:56  <Fluxid> or maybe not
2011-11-19T09:34:12  <grwip> I started with some more complex stuff but diffusion seems to works well
2011-11-19T09:34:14  <mcstar> grwip: i use the Ant's algorithm now
2011-11-19T09:34:30  <grwip> mcstar: hmm what's that?
2011-11-19T09:34:38  <mcstar> i cant say
2011-11-19T09:34:41  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-19T09:34:46  <mcstar> why dont you google a bit
2011-11-19T09:35:37  <grwip> I thought about that, but I thought this algorithm would not work if the ants don't have to come back to the hill
2011-11-19T09:35:45  <grwip> I have to read a bit further I think...
2011-11-19T09:36:13  <pairofdice> ant colony?

2011-11-19T10:02:43  <delt0r_> finding the path from all ants to any/all of the closest food is only O(n)
2011-11-19T10:02:56  <jix> yeah and a bad policy
2011-11-19T10:03:13  <jix> if there are two foods next to each other why send two ants?
2011-11-19T10:03:20  <delt0r_> gives you o(1) stabing quires too

2011-11-19T10:03:56  <delt0r_> the first ant is closer to both... so only send one...
2011-11-19T10:04:08  <jix> delt0r_: so you're searching from all foods to the closest ants

2011-11-19T10:04:26  <jix> still that alone is worse than what I do now
2011-11-19T10:04:35  <jix> delt0r_: certainly not... try it for some examples
2011-11-19T10:04:37  <delt0r_> its O(n) where n is the number of tiles
2011-11-19T10:04:44  <jix> delt0r_: yeah but the result is different
2011-11-19T10:04:47  <delt0r_> wiich is the same as worst case A*
2011-11-19T10:04:54  <delt0r_> jix: no ?
2011-11-19T10:05:11  <pairofdice> Isn't it O(n^2)
2011-11-19T10:05:11  <delt0r_> a closest to b is impies b closest to a
2011-11-19T10:05:15  <delt0r_> no
2011-11-19T10:05:33  <delt0r_> you only need to vist each tile once only
2011-11-19T10:05:53  <jix> delt0r_: if b is the closest food of ant a it doesnt mean a is the closest ant of food b
2011-11-19T10:05:58  <delt0r_> you are only finding the Closest ant to food or visa versa
2011-11-19T10:06:03  <jix> delt0r_: because you have two seperate classes and are only interested into the differences between them

2011-11-19T10:07:56  <delt0r_> so search from all ants at once to all food at once... I get the pairs of ants  and food that are closest
2011-11-19T10:08:47  <delt0r_> in fact you don't need to have the "food" since you can just set up a map that is O(1) for stabing quires .. gives the closest ant/food and path to from it

2011-11-19T10:22:21  <besh> Is there an existing algorithm that can be used to maximize area coverage. Most top bots seem to have. This game f.i http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.5849 , red fills up the whole area.

2011-11-19T10:26:54  <besh> sorry i meant orange
2011-11-19T10:27:00  <besh> My problem is keeping the ant where it is once the tile is "visited". Recycling unseen tiles did not work well enough.
2011-11-19T10:27:15  <mcstar> delt0r_: orange is better than that i think
2011-11-19T10:27:55  <besh> deltor: i tried recycling unseen tiles. The kind of algorithm used by orange is advanced i think.
2011-11-19T10:28:03  <mcstar> orange does very well in "escaping" ants

2011-11-19T10:31:12  <mcstar> it is
2011-11-19T10:32:45  <mcstar> he has some kind of bifurcation
2011-11-19T10:33:31  <mcstar> maybe that whole behavior is just the result of his exclusion code
2011-11-19T10:33:46  <mcstar> i.e. to forbid ants stepping on each other
2011-11-19T10:34:41  <besh> Lot of other top bots have that too that made me think if there is a well known algorithm that I missed.

2011-11-19T10:38:30  <pairofdice> That behaviour sies very easily when you don't allow ants to step on each other

2011-11-19T10:40:56  <besh> you have to place ants to maximize vision (spread out).

2011-11-19T10:43:37  <mcstar> besh: you dont want to spread in mazes
2011-11-19T10:43:42  <mcstar> not like on open maps
2011-11-19T10:44:01  <mcstar> the worst is when your hill is in the bottom of a maze-end
2011-11-19T10:44:12  <mcstar> you relly want to have coordinated guiding
2011-11-19T10:45:28  <besh> I think it is desirable behaviour even in mazes. You can always guard your hills with a few ants until you sense danger.
2011-11-19T10:46:08  <mcstar> no id didnt mean it like that
2011-11-19T10:46:13  <mcstar> -d
2011-11-19T10:46:25  <mcstar> you dont want to clump ants in mazes
2011-11-19T10:46:50  <mcstar> if you do simple spreading in mazes, gas filling up a volume
2011-11-19T10:47:00  <mcstar> it is not desirable
2011-11-19T10:47:32  <mcstar> you want your ants to follow those which reached the furthest from the hill in minimal steps
2011-11-19T10:47:56  <mcstar> actually this is a good idea
2011-11-19T10:48:00  <mcstar> i will try it out
2011-11-19T10:48:15  <besh> ok. I understand. What they seem to do in mazes is own some territory around hills quickly and combat at the frontier. Then gradually expand until you gain all of it.
2011-11-19T10:48:57  <mcstar> yeah
2011-11-19T10:49:10  <mcstar> and you dont want to patrol explored territory too often
2011-11-19T10:49:18  <mcstar> yo inhibit food spawning
2011-11-19T10:49:33  <mcstar> close off areas, to harvest the food a couple of turns later
2011-11-19T10:51:06  <besh> Does food get spawned where there are less ants ?
2011-11-19T10:51:23  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-19T10:51:42  <mcstar> i think
2011-11-19T10:51:47  <besh> i missed that. I thought if I fill out the whole area chances are I get more food.
2011-11-19T10:52:49  <mcstar> i think theres a greater probability of spawning in open areas than near ants
2011-11-19T10:53:07  <mcstar> this might be some emergent food spawning behavior
2011-11-19T10:53:12  <mcstar> i might be wrong too
2011-11-19T10:53:26  <mcstar> i dont have a solid argument right now
2011-11-19T10:54:32  <besh> one reason to maximize vision is to get more food. I do initial exploration of unseen tiles fairly well but maximizing vision is difficult.

2011-11-19T11:41:14  <mcstar> windows?
2011-11-19T11:41:44  <mcstar> probably you dont need to
2011-11-19T11:41:52  <mcstar> just make sure the path is correct
2011-11-19T11:42:10  <mcstar> and change the script if necessary to call the right version
2011-11-19T11:44:18  <Tombana> yea it works
2011-11-19T11:44:24  <Tombana> changed the path variable
2011-11-19T11:44:31  <Tombana> thanks
2011-11-19T11:44:51  <Tombana> so how come the tcp servers can do games much faster than the normal aichallenge servers?
2011-11-19T11:45:11  <pairofdice> The bot runs on your computer, not on the server
2011-11-19T11:45:33  <Tombana> yea i got that, but they still have to wait for the bots to complete their turns
2011-11-19T11:45:38  <Tombana> that won't go faster?
2011-11-19T11:45:50  <pairofdice> The server can run many games at once
2011-11-19T11:46:26  <janzert> and all the bots in each game at the same time
2011-11-19T11:46:29  <Tombana> oh ofc -_-
2011-11-19T11:46:34  <Tombana> ok awesome
2011-11-19T11:46:43  <mcstar> Tombana: the server has >10k users
2011-11-19T11:46:50  <mcstar> tcp does not
2011-11-19T11:47:10  <Tombana> i see

2011-11-19T11:48:24  <Tombana> by the way, currently i'm doing breadth-first-search on all my ants, and its taking about 250 ms when i have 100 ants (and depends on map type). Would you say that that is good enough or is it way too slow? I'm not sure what the speed of this stuff should be
2011-11-19T11:48:49  <Tombana> i mean, it works, but i'm thinking that it should be way faster
2011-11-19T11:49:07  <Tombana> (i'm already using stuff like binary heaps for sorting arrays)
2011-11-19T11:49:52  <mcstar> slow
2011-11-19T11:50:33  <Tombana> ok so should i improve the algorithm or not use bfs search at all ?
2011-11-19T11:51:01  <Tombana> i mean, is it possible to have faster bfs searches?
2011-11-19T11:51:09  <pairofdice> Definitely yes

2011-11-19T11:55:44  <jix> Tombana: where do you need to sort stuff for a bfs?
2011-11-19T11:56:07  <Tombana> what do you mean?
2011-11-19T11:56:09  <Tombana> oh
2011-11-19T11:56:10  <Tombana> eeuh
2011-11-19T11:56:27  <Tombana> well i kinda first made an A* one and then set the heuristic to zero :P
2011-11-19T11:56:40  <Tombana> so it continues at the square with the lowest distance to start
2011-11-19T11:57:07  <Tombana> but that doesnt really make sense now :S
2011-11-19T11:57:08  <Tombana> lol
2011-11-19T11:57:27  <Tombana> oh and my bfs is limited to paths of 80 squares or so
2011-11-19T11:57:33  <jix> well you'll have a dijsktra then
2011-11-19T11:57:40  <Tombana> hmm yeah
2011-11-19T11:57:51  <Tombana> is normal bfs faster?
2011-11-19T11:58:03  <jix> but for unweighted graphs a bfs will get the same result but will be way faster
2011-11-19T11:58:17  <Tombana> i feel so stupid ;p
2011-11-19T11:58:52  <jix> it's really just having a fifo queue + an array to mark visited fields... dequeue one field, add all unseen neighbors and mark them visited, repeat
2011-11-19T11:58:55  <Tombana> so for a bfs you continue at any node in the 'open set'  ?
2011-11-19T11:59:01  <Tombana> hmm
2011-11-19T11:59:18  <jix> Tombana: no it has to be a fifo queue
2011-11-19T11:59:47  <Tombana> but you still have to do the part where, if you find a node that you have visited, check if the distance via the current path is shorter, and then update the parent ??
2011-11-19T11:59:57  <jix> Tombana: no
2011-11-19T12:00:15  <Tombana> cuz i've been doing that
2011-11-19T12:00:19  <Tombana> ok so i'm doing this all wrong then
2011-11-19T12:00:26  <Tombana> i'll research bfs searches and update it
2011-11-19T12:00:30  <Tombana> thanks for the help

2011-11-19T12:01:38  <jix> pairofdice: because otherwise it's not a bfs?
2011-11-19T12:01:58  <mcstar> i have a ring for that
2011-11-19T12:02:13  <mcstar> and its like a fifo
2011-11-19T12:02:24  <mcstar> i just dont want to use dynamic sizes
2011-11-19T12:02:35  <pairofdice> Sure it would be
2011-11-19T12:03:06  <jix> pairofdice: well either it wouldn't be a bfs, or it would be more complex than needed
2011-11-19T12:03:32  <pairofdice> More complex than doing it individually for every goal
2011-11-19T12:04:14  <pairofdice> Or dunno, Well whatever

2011-11-19T12:06:16  <mcstar> for bfs you dont need any kind of sorting or heuristics or prioritization
2011-11-19T12:06:21  <Tombana> pfff i feel like such an idiot for not seeing this
2011-11-19T12:06:30  <mcstar> you get them out the way you put them in
2011-11-19T12:06:34  <Tombana> fifo queueu will do this by itself
2011-11-19T12:06:36  <pairofdice> Yeah, I just use sets
2011-11-19T12:06:43  <mcstar> pairofdice: sets?
2011-11-19T12:07:02  <mcstar> for simple bfs?
2011-11-19T12:07:08  <pairofdice> sets are simple
2011-11-19T12:07:11  <pairofdice> ;p
2011-11-19T12:07:18  <jix> pairofdice: and how do you select the element to expand next?

2011-11-19T12:11:26  <jix> pairofdice: ah so you always have two sets... one that you're expanding and one you put in new nodes into

2011-11-19T12:12:05  <mcstar> so you rather have 2 sets than 1 simple queue
2011-11-19T12:12:15  <mcstar> thats your problem, im outta here

2011-11-19T12:14:32  <Anilm3> pairofdice: why 2 sets?
2011-11-19T12:14:51  <jix> Anilm3: one for distance n, one for distance n+1
2011-11-19T12:15:12  <Anilm3> that's strange
2011-11-19T12:15:28  <pairofdice> It is a bit
2011-11-19T12:15:48  <Anilm3> are you nodes weighted?
2011-11-19T12:15:57  <jix> well from the point of seeing that the algorithm finds shortest paths I think it's a nice representation
2011-11-19T12:16:04  <jix> from the point of beeing efficient it's horrible
2011-11-19T12:16:29  <pairofdice> I'll have to see how it fares with deque
2011-11-19T12:16:34  <Fluxid> deque would be better
2011-11-19T12:16:57  <Anilm3> if you have weights a 2 set approach might be better
2011-11-19T12:17:18  <Anilm3> maybe not your approach
2011-11-19T12:17:19  <jix> Anilm3: if you have weights you'd need dijsktra anyway
2011-11-19T12:17:51  <Anilm3> what if you don't have a stablished target?
2011-11-19T12:18:23  <jix> Anilm3: dijkstra is just an algorithm to visit all nodes in a graph in order of increasing distance, just like bfs
2011-11-19T12:18:54  <Anilm3> I see
2011-11-19T12:18:55  <jix> except it works with weighted graphs, unlike bfs

2011-11-19T13:31:27  <Garf> (though its faster/less prone to roundoff to just keep everything in squared form)

2011-11-19T13:42:55  <Fluxid> uh, it just seems that ants find configuration in which they don't need to move too much to keep distribution... and they naturally group
2011-11-19T13:43:17  <Fluxid> no idea what causes this grouping, since ants try to repell each other...

2011-11-19T14:14:48  <mcstar> this is just the enumeration
2011-11-19T14:14:53  <mcstar> no evaluation
2011-11-19T14:15:03  <Tombana> but this is for the combat part right?
2011-11-19T14:15:03  <BenJackson> one of my recent revelations is that (don't laugh) every ant can only move in 4 directions
2011-11-19T14:15:24  <Tombana> so if an ant might be in a dangerous position you use this to decide wether it can move to a square ?
2011-11-19T14:15:26  <mcstar> BenJackson: how do you mean?
2011-11-19T14:15:33  <BenJackson> I worked out this clever way to de-incentivize the algorithm from sending multiple ants to get one food (eg)
2011-11-19T14:15:39  <mcstar> i mean what did you think before?
2011-11-19T14:15:55  <BenJackson> however LOTS of ants will get closer to food if they go 1 step E
2011-11-19T14:15:55  <Rinum> whoa! ants can attack across water?
2011-11-19T14:16:05  <BenJackson> Rinum oh yes
2011-11-19T14:16:24  <BenJackson> water is irrelevant to combat except as it limits movement
2011-11-19T14:16:34  <Rinum> that changes everything!
2011-11-19T14:16:41  <mcstar> thats why i dont have water on my combat simulator
2011-11-19T14:16:43  <BenJackson> everyone should go read the focus combat resolution code.  it's dirt simple

2011-11-19T14:20:29  <BenJackson> I think you can set cutoff_turn really high
2011-11-19T14:20:44  <BenJackson> if it's >= turn limit I don't think you'll ever stop for not gathering food or razing hills
2011-11-19T14:21:02  <besh> I set turns to 1000 but it didn't work
2011-11-19T14:21:15  <BenJackson> no I mean --cutoff_turn
2011-11-19T14:21:34  <BenJackson> that's the no food/no raze limit
2011-11-19T14:21:40  <besh> ok will try that
2011-11-19T14:24:34  <besh> Thanks. that worked!
2011-11-19T14:26:55  <besh> What do you think of using a queue to recycle unseen tiles?
2011-11-19T14:27:12  <besh> java starter package completely remove tiles once visited
2011-11-19T14:29:20  <Minthos> I don't use java but I run a GC cycle at the beginning of each turn, that typically takes 2 ms locally
2011-11-19T14:29:40  <Minthos> then I rebuild a bunch of map data that the starter package doesn't provide for me, that typically takes 1 ms locally
2011-11-19T14:30:10  <Minthos> so unless you've measured the starter package to be a performance problem, I wouldn't worry about it
2011-11-19T14:30:42  <besh> I am trying to maximize view at all times. Not only when I have univisted tiles.
2011-11-19T14:31:31  <besh> So I need to recycle unseen tiles to get that behaviour. I thought may be using a queue to put recently visited tile to the tail would be a good idea.
2011-11-19T14:32:05  <Minthos> ahh, you mean so your ants revisit them periodically? well, that's one way to solve it
2011-11-19T14:32:39  <Minthos> I just tell my idle ants to go to the nearest unexplored tile
2011-11-19T14:32:56  <besh> i have that too but I don't like it :(
2011-11-19T14:33:04  <Minthos> (unexplored in this case meaning explored or unexplored but currently without vision)
2011-11-19T14:36:22  <besh> Currenlty I divide the map by view radius to reduce number of unseen tiles.
2011-11-19T14:36:57  <thestinger> Minthos: I might try that - atm I don't send them to tiles without vision until a certain time has elapsed since they were last seen
2011-11-19T14:36:58  <besh> Then I recylce when the number drops below some random value. Works to a certain extent..

2011-11-19T14:42:20  <UncleVasya> Hi Smiley1983. Have a little question.
2011-11-19T14:43:02  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.6080 you can see I don't get enough coverage on open maps, and I always lose the foraging war to good bots
2011-11-19T14:43:46  <BenJackson> thestinger: wow that looks a lot like my original bot
2011-11-19T14:44:32  <Minthos> thestinger: your ants have always seemed a bit single-minded
2011-11-19T14:45:08  <UncleVasya> List.filter (fun x -> x != 3) my_list   returns for the list [3;5;2] the correct list [5;2]   but  for the list [4;3;7]  it returns [4;3;7] i.e. List.filter removes elements only from the beginning.
2011-11-19T14:45:19  <Minthos> I currently have a ratio of explorers to fighters that I adjust based on how many ants I have
2011-11-19T14:45:30  <thestinger> yeah, 25% of my ants will forage
2011-11-19T14:45:42  <Minthos> starts out with 100% exploration and decreases gradually
2011-11-19T14:45:43  <thestinger> but atm I don't get enough foraging locations so that many aren't actually foraging
2011-11-19T14:45:58  <BenJackson> there's really not that much food
2011-11-19T14:46:01  <Minthos> ah, I just send all of them

2011-11-19T14:46:19  <UncleVasya> But in the docs I see that List.filter must return all elements that satisfy the predicate. I am confused.
2011-11-19T14:46:24  <Minthos> and everyone gathers food, fighters or explorers, whoever is closest
2011-11-19T14:46:45  <BenJackson> UncleVasya: What language is that?
2011-11-19T14:46:52  <ikaros> looks like ocaml

2011-11-19T15:11:37  <UncleVasya> It's needed for another stuff.
2011-11-19T15:11:53  <UncleVasya> If exists, I filter and do A, if not then do B.
2011-11-19T15:12:13  <ikaros> ah
2011-11-19T15:12:28  *** retybok_ <retybok_!~retybok@31.36.75.119> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-19T15:12:28  <Antimony> wow, simply changing from a map to a vector sped up my code by over 10 times
2011-11-19T15:13:18  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i was wrong it should work as you described
2011-11-19T15:13:26  <mcstar> sorry, expect
2011-11-19T15:13:59  <thestinger> Antimony: regular maps are trees in C++
2011-11-19T15:14:05  <thestinger> you need unordered_map for a hash table
2011-11-19T15:14:07  <Antimony> I know
2011-11-19T15:14:16  <Antimony> in my case, a hash table would be too slow as well
2011-11-19T15:14:37  <ikaros> hmm does ocaml compare lists by value or by reference.. i think that could be the problem
2011-11-19T15:14:40  <ikaros> UncleVasya,
2011-11-19T15:14:50  <Antimony> for a known set of keys, it's more efficent to assign a unique consecutive integer ot each key
2011-11-19T15:14:57  <Antimony> and then use them as indices into a vector
2011-11-19T15:14:57  <ikaros> i didnt use ocaml for a long time but this seems suspicious
2011-11-19T15:15:08  <UncleVasya> I tried with ref too.
2011-11-19T15:15:15  <ikaros> # [1;2] == [1;2];;
2011-11-19T15:15:15  <ikaros> - : bool = false
2011-11-19T15:15:30  <Antimony> has anyone had any luck at using Boost?
2011-11-19T15:15:40  <UncleVasya> wow
2011-11-19T15:16:13  <thestinger> Antimony: nope, because the include path isn't set
2011-11-19T15:16:24  <Antimony> yeah, it's a real shame
2011-11-19T15:16:27  <thestinger> you would have to edit all the boost headers and make them use relative paths to each other
2011-11-19T15:16:35  <Antimony> I'm thinking about trying to do just that
2011-11-19T15:16:36  <UncleVasya> So it is very strange why another parts of my code work well. :)
2011-11-19T15:16:39  <BenJackson> std::set is slower than I expected
2011-11-19T15:16:41  <ikaros> hehe
2011-11-19T15:16:52  <thestinger> BenJackson: why do you need an ordered set?
2011-11-19T15:16:55  <UncleVasya> Ikaros, thank you!
2011-11-19T15:17:02  <a1k0n> yeah i'm using sets too.. probably shouldn't
2011-11-19T15:17:05  <ikaros> np you should check this.. im not sure about it
2011-11-19T15:17:07  <ikaros> only a guess
2011-11-19T15:17:13  <BenJackson> I did some benchmarking where I was going to have a small set of locations that would need to be copied
2011-11-19T15:17:31  <BenJackson> so I compared "grid of bool" (big copy) to set of locations (Theoretically smaller copy, slower indexing)
2011-11-19T15:17:38  <BenJackson> the set version even for small sets was like 16x slower
2011-11-19T15:17:45  <mcstar> once i helped a guy on #lisp, he was trying to compare lists with eq
2011-11-19T15:17:47  <a1k0n> wow
2011-11-19T15:18:16  <a1k0n> ok, changing
2011-11-19T15:18:26  <BenJackson> hey wait, you can't use that in your bot ;-)
2011-11-19T15:18:28  <thestinger> BenJackson: try unordered_set with a hash function that basically cheats
2011-11-19T15:18:34  <BenJackson> I, uh, patented grid of bool
2011-11-19T15:19:03  <mcstar> filter (\x->x /= [8,5]) [[4,5],[8,5],[9,5]]
2011-11-19T15:19:08  <mcstar> works in haskell though
2011-11-19T15:19:41  <thestinger> BenJackson: I'm using unordered_sets and unordered_maps in a few places, and they are competitive with using a 1D or 2D array for the same thing
2011-11-19T15:19:58  <thestinger> my hash function for a location is basically just what you do when you use a 1D array as a 2D one
2011-11-19T15:20:08  <thestinger> row * n_cols + col
2011-11-19T15:20:20  <BenJackson> that's a good idea
2011-11-19T15:20:53  <BenJackson> is that in tr1?
2011-11-19T15:20:59  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-11-19T15:21:09  <thestinger> you can use C++11 for this
2011-11-19T15:21:23  <thestinger> just rename MyBot.cc to MyBot.cpp and the compiler on the server uses -std=c++0x
2011-11-19T15:21:34  <BenJackson> also removes some optimizations for no apparent reason
2011-11-19T15:21:56  <thestinger> -funroll-loops isn't usually a good optimization :P
2011-11-19T15:22:13  <BenJackson> fun roll loops, what could be more fun
2011-11-19T15:22:40  <BenJackson> I did accidentally benchmark a template I made without -O
2011-11-19T15:22:43  <thestinger> it's good with profile guided optimization (PGO + -O3 will enable it)
2011-11-19T15:22:53  <BenJackson> I got it fast enough and then I realized "oops, I'm not even optimizign" and then it was 5x faster
2011-11-19T15:22:55  <a1k0n> so far unordered_set is slower as a drop-in replacement

2011-11-19T15:23:35  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set/max_load_factor I think you can set this to 1 if you know there aren't going to be any collisions
2011-11-19T15:23:49  <ikaros> and since you use != it doesnt work because it is (not ==)

2011-11-19T15:23:59  <BenJackson> how can you know without also knowing the size of the table?
2011-11-19T15:24:08  <UncleVasya> I'll look in the Google how to compare it right. Hope it will help.
2011-11-19T15:24:31  <thestinger> BenJackson: it uses size_t (that's what your hash function has to return)
2011-11-19T15:24:49  <Antimony> how do you know the size of the hastable?
2011-11-19T15:25:01  <BenJackson> I mean how can you know your hash is perfect without knowing the modulus?
2011-11-19T15:25:06  <ikaros> try (fun loc -> not(loc = head))
2011-11-19T15:25:15  <ikaros> i think this should work
2011-11-19T15:25:52  <thestinger> BenJackson: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set/reserve combined with that maybe?
2011-11-19T15:27:27  <UncleVasya> ikaros: It works! I'd never solve it by my own.
2011-11-19T15:27:51  <ikaros> =)
2011-11-19T15:29:06  <thestinger> meh, using a vector/array is going to be easier than dealing with the collision API crap

2011-11-19T15:31:18  <Tombana> cant wait to have that
2011-11-19T15:31:52  <UncleVasya> I thought it is only cosmetic difference and have changed in starterpack all not(a = b) to the a!= b because my eyes like it more. So now with the new knowing I  must check out all these places :)
2011-11-19T15:33:26  <mcstar> UncleVasya: in lisp you have eq, eql, equal, =, string=, char=
2011-11-19T15:33:57  <mcstar> so sometimes this can be subtle
2011-11-19T15:34:33  <thestinger> BenJackson: I've been printing out load_factor, and it never goes above 1 for any of my maps/sets
2011-11-19T15:34:45  <thestinger> I'm not sure if that's a guarantee or just libstdc++ behaviour

2011-11-19T16:15:57  <a1k0n> nice.
2011-11-19T16:16:32  <thestinger> yeah, my version on the site has no combat awareness or defense so it pretty much always loses hills early
2011-11-19T16:16:41  <thestinger> but rushing at enemy hills ends up getting lots of points
2011-11-19T16:17:35  <yoden> I still think that once people get better defense/combat
2011-11-19T16:17:40  <yoden> hill rushing will be a bad strategy
2011-11-19T16:19:35  <thestinger> I think rushing at a hill has a pretty good chance of working if it's within ~50-100 turns of the game starting
2011-11-19T16:19:52  <thestinger> after that you need a better strategy like territory control
2011-11-19T16:20:14  <yoden> yeah, especially if it's one of those lame maps that puts the hills practically on top of each other -_-

2011-11-19T17:04:31  <jab_bott> mcstar: is that a question? the error makes sense - operator+ will obviously need to modify the 'this' object, so it can't be const
2011-11-19T17:04:49  <mcstar> pos tmpPos=*vecIt+o[i];
2011-11-19T17:04:51  <mcstar> ok
2011-11-19T17:05:00  <jab_bott> mcstar: you could pass a const pos as the to-add param, but not the to-add-to param

2011-11-19T17:06:24  <mcstar> why is the first one ok, and the latter one not?
2011-11-19T17:06:27  <jab_bott> mcstar: not sure of the syntax, but +(pos a, pos b) doesn't need to modify anything, but +(pos) does
2011-11-19T17:06:56  <mcstar> jab_bott: where is +(pos) here:
2011-11-19T17:07:07  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-19T17:07:17  <jab_bott> pos pos::operator+(pos)
2011-11-19T17:07:36  <jab_bott> it only takes one param, so the first is the object you're applying it to right?
2011-11-19T17:07:43  <mcstar> right
2011-11-19T17:07:46  <mcstar> ok
2011-11-19T17:07:53  <mcstar> but whats the difference between my two lines that i pasted
2011-11-19T17:08:13  <mcstar> why would the first be of 2 args, and the second of 1 arg?
2011-11-19T17:08:14  <jab_bott> mcstar: ok, well if it doesn't add anything to the object, add the word const at the end of the function prototype
2011-11-19T17:08:28  <jab_bott> that means the that object itself is const (i.e. the this will be const)
2011-11-19T17:08:43  <mcstar> ok yes
2011-11-19T17:08:52  <mcstar> but whats the difference here:
2011-11-19T17:08:55  <mcstar> pos tmpPos=*vecIt+o[i];
2011-11-19T17:08:58  <mcstar> pos enemyPos=(hmapIt->first)+o[i];
2011-11-19T17:09:07  <mcstar> *vecIt is a pos
2011-11-19T17:09:13  <mcstar> hmapIt->first is a pos too
2011-11-19T17:09:18  <thestinger> which one doesn't work?
2011-11-19T17:09:21  <mcstar> the latter
2011-11-19T17:09:49  <thestinger> so I guess hmapIt->first is const, and you can't just discard the qualifier implicitly due to const-correctness
2011-11-19T17:09:50  <ikaros> first is an iterator
2011-11-19T17:10:12  <mcstar> thestinger: could be

2011-11-19T17:39:45  <Dean> but as I don't have time fo the challenge it's a waste of time having an account
2011-11-19T17:40:09  <Anilm3> You can also try on the forum

2011-11-19T18:00:24  <Anilm3> also called manhattan distance

2011-11-19T18:00:40  <antimatroid1> that's the shape that I get for the edge of battle
2011-11-19T18:01:02  <mcstar> Anilm3: ?
2011-11-19T18:01:04  <pairofdice> Yeah, that's where I start checking
2011-11-19T18:01:08  <mcstar> dont say mahattan here
2011-11-19T18:01:12  <Anilm3> why?
2011-11-19T18:01:20  <antimatroid1> because manhatten is a different metric
2011-11-19T18:01:27  <antimatroid1> and it's not equivalent to the euclidean metric
2011-11-19T18:01:31  <mcstar> antimatroid1: that is correct
2011-11-19T18:01:42  <thestinger> it's 'row_distance ** 2 + col_distance ** 2' for euclidean distance squared
2011-11-19T18:01:45  <mcstar> but for that you only need to check eclidean^2<10
2011-11-19T18:01:55  <antimatroid1> mcstar: what?
2011-11-19T18:02:00  <mcstar> check it out
2011-11-19T18:02:07  <mcstar> i use that
2011-11-19T18:02:14  <mcstar> teh formula i gave you?
2011-11-19T18:02:18  <thestinger> yeah, I do it mcstar's way too
2011-11-19T18:02:35  <antimatroid1> do you make sure you don't move an ant into a combat zone unless done with a game tree?
2011-11-19T18:02:37  <pairofdice> mcstar, if the ants are moving towards each other you need to check <= 17
2011-11-19T18:02:41  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-19T18:02:44  <antimatroid1> ah okay
2011-11-19T18:02:54  <mcstar> pairofdice: i dont move my ant there
2011-11-19T18:02:59  <mcstar> so i dont need a bigger radius
2011-11-19T18:03:14  <mcstar> its like a wall for it
2011-11-19T18:03:26  <antimatroid1> mcstar: what about when you have a..%b
2011-11-19T18:03:33  <antimatroid1> do you correctly realise that b can't engage you?
2011-11-19T18:04:10  <mcstar> i guess
2011-11-19T18:04:10  <pairofdice> Mine certainly don't
2011-11-19T18:04:19  <antimatroid1> you guess that you do?
2011-11-19T18:04:19  <mcstar> b cant step there so yes
2011-11-19T18:04:21  <jab_bott> antimatroid1: ?? ants CAN engage through water, can't they?

2011-11-19T18:04:41  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-19T18:04:46  <pairofdice> So a can move without danger
2011-11-19T18:05:29  <antimatroid1> i think i mean a.%b didn't i?
2011-11-19T18:05:38  <jab_bott> ahh I see - like you're checking which ones might be attackable next turn after they have potentially moved towards you

2011-11-19T18:05:56  <mcstar> i exclude that tile from b's moves
2011-11-19T18:06:02  <antimatroid1> do you check within the battle radius of the land neighbours of b?

2011-11-19T18:07:39  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-19T18:07:41  <antimatroid1> still dangerous but*
2011-11-19T18:08:15  <mcstar> basically i do a bfs from enemies
2011-11-19T18:08:22  <mcstar> but i select by euclidean distance
2011-11-19T18:08:24  <mcstar> no water
2011-11-19T18:08:40  <mcstar> so its an euclidean voronoi region that i gat
2011-11-19T18:08:42  <mcstar> get*
2011-11-19T18:08:57  <mcstar> so i match ants to enemies that fall in a region
2011-11-19T18:08:57  <antimatroid1> what about

2011-11-19T18:08:58  <antimatroid1> a%b

2011-11-19T18:09:05  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-19T18:09:08  <antimatroid1> if you block by water aren't you skipping pairing those ants?
2011-11-19T18:09:10  <mcstar> that cant be
2011-11-19T18:09:15  <pairofdice> Those are dead ants
2011-11-19T18:09:19  <mcstar> a.b not possible
2011-11-19T18:09:19  <thestinger> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/5b7azNt2Zv7yt5m4bX1J/ I divide stuff into combat areas like that
2011-11-19T18:09:31  <antimatroid1> make the water 2 wide then
2011-11-19T18:09:32  <antimatroid1> same problem
2011-11-19T18:09:33  <mcstar> antimatroid1: they must battle now
2011-11-19T18:09:41  <antimatroid1> no
2011-11-19T18:09:42  <antimatroid1> hmmm
2011-11-19T18:10:17  <antimatroid1> i wonder, how many of these nice little things break when you change the attack radius?
2011-11-19T18:10:24  <antimatroid1> i like for my bot to not make assumptions
2011-11-19T18:10:30  <thestinger> so my code would include a and b in a battle
2011-11-19T18:10:45  <thestinger> but then when that's resolved, a would be allowed to move
2011-11-19T18:10:57  <thestinger> actually somewhat broken atm but that's the idea :P
2011-11-19T18:11:50  <antimatroid1> i do have my code set up for finding all feasible moves for a set of ants less those which have friend ants colliding (not all ants have to be from the same team and will potentially collide)

2011-11-19T18:12:39  <jab_bott> antimatroid1: I get what you're saying - you think mcstar is blocking the attack by water - he's not, he moves his enemy ants on all possible moves then calculates all the danger squares for the next turn based on those five (or less) moves
2011-11-19T18:14:00  <jab_bott> antimatroid1: so the water doesn't block the attack calculation, it only excludes the extra possible future state of the enemy ant which is used to calculate danger from

2011-11-19T18:51:18  <thestinger> yeah, I think dividing up the zones works fine
2011-11-19T18:51:27  <thestinger> and then optimizing results in the zones works fine
2011-11-19T18:51:32  <thestinger> the problem is that I don't predict enemy moves
2011-11-19T18:51:35  <thestinger> I assume they stay still
2011-11-19T18:51:43  <a1k0n> oh.  yeah that's a problem.
2011-11-19T18:51:45  <thestinger> there may be bugs in the combat zone code though
2011-11-19T18:52:00  <thestinger> I tried predicting moves, but it was way too slow
2011-11-19T18:52:05  <a1k0n> you could at least try both sitting still and moving closer to your ants
2011-11-19T18:52:08  <thestinger> now I can limit it to small battles
2011-11-19T18:52:53  <thestinger> I also broke my code for running away and strafing, so my ants just stay still and chill when they're scared
2011-11-19T18:53:47  <jab_bott> amstan: heya - does something strip spaces when outputting the JSON replay data?
2011-11-19T18:53:49  <thestinger> if they see a bunch of enemy ants and no friends are nearby, not only will they no longer run away - they'll actually wait there to die even if they could move somewhere
2011-11-19T18:53:52  <thestinger> >.<
2011-11-19T18:54:05  <jab_bott> amstan: I'm trying to find the code that does that
2011-11-19T18:54:06  <amstan> jab_bott: what do you mean?
2011-11-19T18:54:07  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: are you doing game trees yet
2011-11-19T18:54:14  <amstan> spaces out of what?
2011-11-19T18:54:14  <a1k0n> nope
2011-11-19T18:54:25  <a1k0n> well.. not.. really
2011-11-19T18:54:29  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to set up 1 ply minimax atm
2011-11-19T18:54:30  <jab_bott> amstan: out of the replay JSON string
2011-11-19T18:54:44  <a1k0n> i've implemented full minimax for 2v1, i suppose i should use that in that specific situation
2011-11-19T18:54:48  <antimatroid1> i'm just treating it as me vs. enemies with them playing to make my score as worse as possible
2011-11-19T18:54:51  <amstan> why does it matter? json is json, it'll parse to the same thing no matter if htere's spaces or not
2011-11-19T18:55:18  <antimatroid1> well, not my score
2011-11-19T18:55:21  <jab_bott> amstan: well something is stripping spaces within the strings (used as values indictionaries within JSON)
2011-11-19T18:55:27  <a1k0n> i think the fact that we have simultaneous moves might be more important in this game than in tron
2011-11-19T18:55:31  <antimatroid1> but make my outcome as badly ranked as possible as per my order operation
2011-11-19T18:55:37  <amstan> jab_bott: oh, that would be bad
2011-11-19T18:55:41  <amstan> jab_bott: not sure
2011-11-19T18:55:42  <a1k0n> and as such the wrongness of minimax might make it too conservative
2011-11-19T18:56:03  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: you think? it wouldn't be hard for my to turn my game representation into a 2 player zero sum simultaneous game
2011-11-19T18:56:06  <a1k0n> though to fix that you could randomly choose between minimax and maximin
2011-11-19T18:56:11  <antimatroid1> but selecting a single strategy from such a game form is harder :\
2011-11-19T18:56:19  <a1k0n> yeah, way too many moves
2011-11-19T18:56:27  <a1k0n> pretty hard to solve the LP for that
2011-11-19T18:56:48  <antimatroid1> i have functions to give me all non-friendly-colliding moves for a set of ants (the ants don't all need to be the same player and can collide enemy ants)
2011-11-19T18:56:57  <a1k0n> that's why i'm sampling.  my assumption of minimax wrongness could be wrong, of course.
2011-11-19T18:56:57  <antimatroid1> nah wouldn't be looking for a mixed strategy to play
2011-11-19T18:57:07  <antimatroid1> you can do other stuff on such games to pick a strategy
2011-11-19T18:57:13  <antimatroid1> some kind of regret function might work well
2011-11-19T18:57:34  <antimatroid1> or just play the strategy that maximises your least preferred state for each strategy
2011-11-19T18:58:02  <antimatroid1> or order the outcomes for each strategy and then iteratitively tiebreak it
2011-11-19T18:58:03  <a1k0n> yeah i suppose
2011-11-19T18:58:07  <antimatroid1> although i don't like ones chances of doing that
2011-11-19T18:58:56  <antimatroid1> there's also a few numerical methods i've read for trying to converge on a mixed strategy nash equilibrium for 2 player simultaneous zero sum games
2011-11-19T18:59:05  <antimatroid1> found those during planet wars
2011-11-19T18:59:22  <a1k0n> oh yeah?
2011-11-19T18:59:30  <a1k0n> were they of any use in planet wars?

2011-11-19T19:03:25  <antimatroid1> ohhh sweet
2011-11-19T19:03:33  <antimatroid1> i just realised a time when i can make use of future ants
2011-11-19T19:03:44  <jab_bott> amstan: also something is processing escaped characters (like \n) within strings - i.e. if I put "\\n" so I actually get a backslash then an n in the string it's stripping that too
2011-11-19T19:04:19  <antimatroid1> it shouldn't be too hard to track how big your hive is, and if your hive >= number of hills then you can choose to spawn ants at hills by making sure they're clear which can be useful while defending
2011-11-19T19:04:24  <antimatroid1> more ants to kill off nearby enemies

2011-11-19T19:12:10  <jab_bott> @later tell mleise Something is stripping spaces and unescaping backslash-escapes from the JSON between when it's written to 0.replay and replay.0.html - including such characters *within* JSON string values... do you know where this code is so I can fix it?

2011-11-19T19:13:06  <jab_bott> mcstar: isn't a flood-fill just a DFS for the left/right nodes but BFS for the up/down ones?

2011-11-19T21:00:32  <twymer> having issues dealing with groups of ants (who are being pathed by a*) colliding and causing clogs
2011-11-19T21:00:35  <twymer> anyone have any tips for this?

2011-11-19T21:09:49  <a1k0n> twymer: form a dependency chain.  have a 'done moving' flag in each ant.  if ant 1 wants to move where ant 2 is and ant 2 is not done moving, then recursively move ant 2 (be sure to check for loops)
2011-11-19T21:10:10  <a1k0n> if ant 2 is done moving, find a second-best move, and so on
2011-11-19T21:12:17  <antimatroid> twymer: i have a function i call at the end that will move any unmoved ants that are going to collide
2011-11-19T21:12:31  <antimatroid> and wont move two ants into the same square, but will move an ant into a square containing an unmoved ant
2011-11-19T21:12:49  <antimatroid> that may end up with the ocassional collision, but i'll take that

2011-11-19T21:14:46  <thestinger> I do it with brute-force atm, and it's fast enough
2011-11-19T21:15:09  <thestinger> I keep track of the moves that would bring each ant closer to a target
2011-11-19T21:15:22  <antimatroid> i want to get battle code going
2011-11-19T21:15:25  <thestinger> then just keep looping through that at the end until a move isn't done
2011-11-19T21:15:29  <antimatroid> but it requires quite a few things to be written up

2011-11-19T21:26:56  <antimatroid> a1k0n: not really sure, i'm taking one of my unmoved ants as the start of a partition and adding that to a queue, then for each ant location added to the partition/queue i add neighbouring friends and any enemies it could possibly engage in battle with
2011-11-19T21:27:23  <antimatroid> then i'm going to set a maximum size for these partitions
2011-11-19T21:27:45  <antimatroid> i correctly work out ants that can/cannot engage in battle with water information taken into consideration too
2011-11-19T21:28:30  <antimatroid> i ended up just having a grid of location vectors indicating which ants could possibly end up in the battle radius of a square, then i use that information while making the partitions

2011-11-19T21:28:40  <a1k0n> i see.  so in other words you're finding the connected components of ants (assuming you start from a bitartite graph between ants of opposing forces) and then splitting based on some heuristic
2011-11-19T21:28:59  <a1k0n> or actually it's not bipartite since you consider friends
2011-11-19T21:29:05  <antimatroid> um.. something like that i guess
2011-11-19T21:29:07  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-19T21:29:17  <antimatroid> i consider neigbouring friends or friends in range of an enemy
2011-11-19T21:29:23  <antimatroid> and similarly for each of the enemy ants added
2011-11-19T21:29:43  <antimatroid> then i'm not quite sure how i'll reduce the size of larger partitions yet
2011-11-19T21:29:47  <a1k0n> but you dont have to consider friends, do you?  they'll get added as being in range of the first enemy
2011-11-19T21:29:57  <antimatroid> not necessarily
2011-11-19T21:30:03  <antimatroid> consider aa...b

2011-11-19T21:34:18  <antimatroid> a1k0n: when searching and what not and checking which squares in the grid have been visitied, would be it better to have a 2d vector of bools and store which locations have been marked as visited for when resetting or just have a set of locations which have been visited and check that?
2011-11-19T21:34:46  <antimatroid> most of the time when clearing the information it should be fairly sparse, so the main cost comes in making the 2d grid
2011-11-19T21:38:20  <a1k0n> i have a ton of info on each square in the grid cuz it needs to be accessed constantly
2011-11-19T21:38:38  <a1k0n> and i just incrementally update it

2011-11-19T21:57:17  <jab_bott> a1k0n: the java one is actually just a web-environment simulator (or something like that) so that the JS visualizer runs in it. I've never managed to get that working
