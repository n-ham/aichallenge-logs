2011-08-31T02:39:09  <antimatroid> because it provides people with obvious things to improve on, and even working out paths in this isn't trivial
2011-08-31T02:39:43  <antimatroid> although I am a little worried about how different the top bots are, and nobody wants first place to be decided by chance rather than a bot being clearly superior

2011-08-31T07:53:45  <delt0r> If you are running a website for the TCP server... how would you want it to work?
2011-08-31T07:54:12  <delt0r> PHP/Phython (yuck--but hay its one way to do it)
2011-08-31T07:54:51  <delt0r> Application that writes to a database --then you do the web site anyway you want
2011-08-31T07:55:24  <delt0r> application that writes to a set of flat files --possibly even with html formating
2011-08-31T07:55:28  <delt0r> etc. etc etc
2011-08-31T07:57:00  <delt0r> since i won't run the site or have a server for it...what others would prefer is perhaps relevant

2011-08-31T08:19:22  <berak> hi delt0r ;) how far did you get ?
2011-08-31T08:21:19  <delt0r> not far... didn't have the time in the weekend in the end
2011-08-31T08:21:31  <delt0r> so really only just started looking at the problem
2011-08-31T08:21:53  <delt0r> just about finished a engine then i will finsih off a JAntManager thing
2011-08-31T08:22:01  <delt0r> then perhaps look at tcp
2011-08-31T08:22:10  <berak> you're trying to rewrite the whole thing ? game/server/web/gui front ?
2011-08-31T08:22:21  <delt0r> really not sure how folks would want to run the server
2011-08-31T08:22:33  <delt0r> sure why not... its not very complicated
2011-08-31T08:22:52  <delt0r> and that gets me to grips with game/rules
2011-08-31T08:23:00  <delt0r> a bot will be much more work
2011-08-31T08:23:45  <delt0r> the server would not be a gui thing...
2011-08-31T08:23:54  <delt0r> its for running on a server after all
2011-08-31T08:24:02  <delt0r> thats if i get too it...
2011-08-31T08:24:19  <delt0r> real life does interfere
2011-08-31T08:25:12  <berak>  started playing with that again, too on the wekend. all in python. grrr
2011-08-31T08:25:24  <delt0r> yea not a fan myself
2011-08-31T08:25:34  <delt0r> but better than php or perl
2011-08-31T08:25:57  <berak> tried to interface the sandbox thing, and feed a list of that into the engine.
2011-08-31T08:25:59  <delt0r> still quite readable --in a python kind of way.

2011-08-31T08:26:23  <delt0r> berak: are you looking at doing a server?
2011-08-31T08:26:31  <berak> works quite nice, but it's multithreaded now
2011-08-31T08:26:54  <delt0r> thats fine for a server... linux can handle 100-1000 of threads
2011-08-31T08:26:59  <berak> i had one 2 month ago, sort of. quite a failure, trying to repair that
2011-08-31T08:27:00  <delt0r> windows.... not so much
2011-08-31T08:27:26  <delt0r> right cool... well if you are going to have one going --i don't need to bother
2011-08-31T08:27:32  <berak> debugging multithreaded stuff on the console ...
2011-08-31T08:27:36  <delt0r> how are you structuring yours?
2011-08-31T08:28:05  <delt0r> berak: you get use to it.. done so much thread work and many core work now, that its all normal for me
2011-08-31T08:28:13  <berak> a tcp server, a web server and a mem-db shared
2011-08-31T08:28:32  <delt0r> java does in fact have some great features there. compared to some other langs
2011-08-31T08:29:03  <delt0r> right... so the tcp server writes to a db --then you plug the web pages into that
2011-08-31T08:29:20  <berak> hmm, yes. and a compiler. that's what i'm missing most
2011-08-31T08:29:57  <berak> both server start from the same process, so they can share memory
2011-08-31T08:30:17  <delt0r> this is in python?
2011-08-31T08:30:22  <berak> yes
2011-08-31T08:30:42  <delt0r> well i think you have the winner ... I wasn't going to use python
2011-08-31T08:30:52  <delt0r> folks will want to use yours rather than mine

2011-08-31T08:31:47  <berak> well, it has to work properly first... my 1st effort failed miserably
2011-08-31T08:31:50  <delt0r> its all up to you berak --no pressure ;)
2011-08-31T08:32:20  <delt0r> well i was thinking of the tcp game server just writing out some html pages
2011-08-31T08:32:27  <delt0r> brutally simple
2011-08-31T08:33:07  <berak> yeah shure, just open another server socket there and go
2011-08-31T08:33:08  <delt0r> a single file of usernames/passwords
2011-08-31T08:33:18  <delt0r> that is it..
2011-08-31T08:33:40  <delt0r> oh let something else serve the html...like Apache

2011-08-31T08:34:41  <berak> did you take a closer look at jskills ?
2011-08-31T08:35:39  <delt0r> yea
2011-08-31T08:35:43  <berak> it doesn't like [0,0,0,0] rankins, obviously
2011-08-31T08:35:50  <delt0r> but without a stack trace
2011-08-31T08:36:36  <delt0r> didn't get far
2011-08-31T08:36:42  <berak> ah, wait, just got one:
2011-08-31T08:36:52  <delt0r> not really writen the way i would do it
2011-08-31T08:37:04  <delt0r> its a c# port IIRC
2011-08-31T08:38:41  <UncleVasya> deltor, thank you for amazing JBotManager. It was very, VERY helpful tool. I see you have time for making a new one, for ants, so thanks again :)
2011-08-31T08:39:07  <delt0r> its getting close to done... assuming i get time to work on it
2011-08-31T08:39:09  <berak> http://pastebin.com/RcF2sdLK
2011-08-31T08:39:22  <delt0r> a week of real time is not really a full day on this suff
2011-08-31T08:39:47  <delt0r> berak: will have a look
2011-08-31T08:40:10  <delt0r> that is the error the main game web page has too
2011-08-31T08:40:31  <berak> look at the ranks it' 4 times 5 there.
2011-08-31T08:40:32  <delt0r> they bump it up to 1000 iterations and saw the error less often
2011-08-31T08:40:52  <UncleVasya> Is JBotManager open source?
2011-08-31T08:40:57  <delt0r> but really there should be a clear exit clause
2011-08-31T08:41:00  <delt0r> UncleVasya: yes
2011-08-31T08:41:14  <delt0r> The jar always contained the latest source
2011-08-31T08:41:37  <delt0r> note that 2 others submitted patches so it was not 100% my work
2011-08-31T08:42:03  <berak> ah, good to know, it's the same thing, the issues on the wiki are a bit vague there
2011-08-31T08:42:13  <delt0r> The licence if you need one was either BSD or public domain -- i don't recall which
2011-08-31T08:44:40  <UncleVasya> ah, so I don't need to search sources elsewhere, I just need to take it from jar somehow. I'm not familiar with java, but will lurk for it.
2011-08-31T08:44:57  <delt0r> its just a zip file UncleVasya
2011-08-31T08:45:15  <UncleVasya> ok
2011-08-31T08:45:51  <delt0r> berak: well from what i understand setting max iterations to something like 10000 then silently droping out of the loop will be fine
2011-08-31T08:46:30  <delt0r> the loop is to solve the system of equations approximately anyway
2011-08-31T08:46:39  <delt0r> so the error should be small
2011-08-31T08:46:54  <delt0r> without testing i can't be sure
2011-08-31T08:47:21  <berak> delt0r, can you recommend an easy decompiler ?
2011-08-31T08:47:31  <berak> jaad here, pretty old
2011-08-31T08:47:35  <delt0r> there are some good ones...
2011-08-31T08:47:45  <delt0r> but no --i almost never need to do that
2011-08-31T08:48:00  <delt0r> why do you need one? JSkills is on git
2011-08-31T08:48:09  <delt0r> github
2011-08-31T08:48:12  <berak> wait, where did you ge
2011-08-31T08:48:14  <berak> ok
2011-08-31T08:48:24  <delt0r> https://github.com/nsp/JSkills/blob/master/src/jskills/factorgraphs/ScheduleLoop.java
2011-08-31T08:48:34  <berak> the front door ;)
2011-08-31T08:50:59  <antimatroid> delt0r: reading still, but it'd be really neat if the tcp server site was actually part of the contest webpage (ie. make tcp more official)
2011-08-31T08:51:20  <delt0r> my guess is that the delta is large because you can order people in a draw either way. So the max iteration in this case will be about how long you go "eni meni mo"
2011-08-31T08:51:24  <antimatroid> hopefully that might encourage more people to test on tcp too
2011-08-31T08:52:03  <delt0r> antimatroid: since berak is doing it in python, this stands a far better chance of that than anything i would do
2011-08-31T08:52:28  <antimatroid> berak: ^^ that :P
2011-08-31T08:53:02  <berak> ^^^°<
2011-08-31T08:53:08  <delt0r> berak: do you use your own DB schema or the one used on the beta site
2011-08-31T08:53:45  <berak> no, just dome dicts in mem, pickled from time to time
2011-08-31T08:53:52  <delt0r> right
2011-08-31T08:54:16  <delt0r> probably good enough for government work ;)
2011-08-31T08:54:34  <delt0r> forgot about python pickling
2011-08-31T08:55:32  <berak> but moving that to sqlite might be a better idea, just started with the chapest..
2011-08-31T08:55:59  <delt0r> well just to some sql db right.. no need to make it specific... a
2011-08-31T08:56:11  <berak> and the games go straight to disk
2011-08-31T08:56:36  <delt0r> at any rate --something that works is better than something that doesn't --but would be perfect if it did
2011-08-31T08:57:43  * UncleVasya so happy to see some life here
2011-08-31T08:57:56  <delt0r> also since folks often have many names on a tcp server, it can and perhaps should be a little more lax with player management. The ranks are not really representative
2011-08-31T08:58:51  <delt0r> even what players you match with is going to be largely a function of who is connected --not your rank
2011-08-31T08:59:23  <delt0r> berak: how do you deal with 4 player games? do clients get to choose what they want to play? do you get a mix?
2011-08-31T08:59:26  <berak> player management. good topic. how would you go at that ?
2011-08-31T08:59:40  <delt0r> or is it always 4 player --and i just missed the memo
2011-08-31T08:59:46  <delt0r> berak: like the last one...
2011-08-31T08:59:56  <berak> i just choose a random map, then collect players for it
2011-08-31T09:00:10  <delt0r> fist time seen add them... first time with a password, they always need a  password
2011-08-31T09:00:19  <berak> no ranges from 2 to 10 players
2011-08-31T09:00:25  <delt0r> right... simple is good..
2011-08-31T09:01:27  <delt0r> but if the server is not busy a 10 player map my "block" since you never have enough connected?
2011-08-31T09:01:48  <delt0r> s/my/may
2011-08-31T09:01:57  <berak> you can never tell, how many more are going to come, true
2011-08-31T09:02:21  <delt0r> well a timeout to a smaller map may be a idea... again.. perhaps for laters
2011-08-31T09:02:46  * delt0r goes to get coffee 
2011-08-31T09:04:03  * berak AHHHHHH
2011-08-31T09:04:39  <berak> thanks reminding me! once a month i forget to place the cup under the espresso machine...
2011-08-31T09:05:51  <berak> ever had to swap up a triple espresso ?
2011-08-31T09:11:39  * delt0r smells his wonderful coffee 
2011-08-31T09:12:59  <berak> yeah, thanks for saving mine in the very last second ;)
2011-08-31T09:16:14  <antimatroid> it would be nice if you could try and match up bots with a closer ranking
2011-08-31T09:16:24  <delt0r> antimatroid: on tcp?
2011-08-31T09:16:42  <antimatroid> yeah, but if it's waiting too long then just start a game with the bots there
2011-08-31T09:16:53  <antimatroid> otherwise it's hard for people like bocsi to test on tcp
2011-08-31T09:16:56  <delt0r> that really doesn't work well unless you start with waiting ques... then how long do you wait? not a simple problem to solve
2011-08-31T09:17:05  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@d58-73.icpnet.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-31T09:17:13  <antimatroid> one would need to pick a wait amount
2011-08-31T09:17:51  <delt0r> also often there are only a few people online... basically TCP will be a case of taking what you get
2011-08-31T09:17:56  <berak> hopfully, there's already bots playing, that will be available soon
2011-08-31T09:18:10  <delt0r> hell even the ranking are pretty arbitrary
2011-08-31T09:18:14  <antimatroid> during the contest quite a few people leave bots running non stop on tcp
2011-08-31T09:18:22  <delt0r> yea i did too
2011-08-31T09:18:26  <delt0r> but its not many
2011-08-31T09:18:46  <delt0r> and often players have 2-5 different names etc
2011-08-31T09:19:06  <antimatroid> the simple way is probably fine for the moment, although i'd try and make it not too difficult to add in some kine of matching stuff if needed later if possible
2011-08-31T09:19:31  <antimatroid> the other thing is making sure players have password access to usernames for 24 hours?
2011-08-31T09:19:51  <antimatroid> sorry if that's been covered, that's just something I thought of :p
2011-08-31T09:19:53  <berak> how would you match them ? group similar ranks ?
2011-08-31T09:20:34  <antimatroid> yeah, how are you planning to rank them?
2011-08-31T09:20:50  <mcstar> antimatroid: have you done any integer programming? im interested in maximizing an expression with absolute value functions in it
2011-08-31T09:21:08  <berak> antimatroid: trueskill
2011-08-31T09:21:18  <antimatroid> mcstar: I haven't, I've done simplex for linear programs but not integer, it's grosser too :P
2011-08-31T09:21:58  <mcstar> right, have you got any idea, on how to deal with the absolute value functions?
2011-08-31T09:22:23  <mcstar> plus, the variable is strictly bounded from both sides
2011-08-31T09:22:35  <antimatroid> nope, sorry
2011-08-31T09:22:37  <mcstar> maybe there are constraints among them too
2011-08-31T09:22:41  <mcstar> ok
2011-08-31T09:22:52  <mcstar> ill just browse wiki then
2011-08-31T09:24:02  <delt0r> integer programing in the general case is NP hard IIRC
2011-08-31T09:24:21  <mcstar> still, it is solvable

2011-08-31T09:24:32  <delt0r> however a large class can be effeivly solved by relaxing the integer constraint

2011-08-31T09:24:43  <mcstar> yeah, not going to work this time
2011-08-31T09:24:56  <delt0r> then finding the "closest" integer solution IIRC
2011-08-31T09:25:38  <delt0r> right..well the np hard thing is not as bad as it sounds. when dealing with 1millon varables or something
2011-08-31T09:25:47  <mcstar> maybe, if i scale up my variables quite much, it could be possible to use a linear programming solution, ill look into that
2011-08-31T09:25:49  <delt0r> they can still get pretty good answers
2011-08-31T09:27:05  <mcstar> it is related to my bot, so ultimately it will need to be very fast
2011-08-31T09:27:50  <mcstar> and the optimal solution condition can be relaxed too later, once ill get a grasp of the problem
2011-08-31T09:29:37  <delt0r> optimal is the enemy of good enough
2011-08-31T09:30:29  <mcstar> you cant know what is good enough without having a feel for the optimal
2011-08-31T09:31:11  <delt0r> true

2011-08-31T09:33:21  <mcstar> UncleVasya, and his brain-teasers
2011-08-31T09:33:58  <mcstar> oh, i left out the laughing face :D
2011-08-31T09:36:14  <delt0r> no no no
2011-08-31T09:36:21  <delt0r> good enough for me to win ;)
2011-08-31T09:41:11  <delt0r> in fact i doubt i will have a entry
2011-08-31T09:42:30  <mcstar> now your prev. line makes sense to me
2011-08-31T09:42:38  <mcstar> so why not?
2011-08-31T09:42:52  <mcstar> just leave the engine/tcp server alone, and concentrate on a bot
2011-08-31T09:43:44  <mcstar> i think break will be more than happy to write it on his/her own
2011-08-31T09:49:43  *** deeper-blue <deeper-blue!~deeper-bl@96.24.31.153> has quit IRC (Quit: deeper-blue)
2011-08-31T09:51:30  <delt0r> even then i doubt i will have time
2011-08-31T09:51:48  <delt0r> a tcp server + jantmanager is a lot less work that a bot
2011-08-31T09:52:00  <antimatroid> and working on a bot is very addictive
2011-08-31T09:52:01  <delt0r> a bot is quite a bit of work IMO
2011-08-31T09:52:19  <delt0r> its not a good year for hobby time this year for me
2011-08-31T09:52:35  <delt0r> but meh... i like my job so it is not all bad
2011-08-31T09:52:42  <antimatroid> i'm all good if the contest is running part way through november still, otherwise i have no spare time
2011-08-31T09:52:49  <mcstar> so you prefer to build the grill, but not to roast the steak, interesting
2011-08-31T09:53:09  <delt0r> not a good metaphor
2011-08-31T09:53:12  <antimatroid> i want to see some games on my maps :(
2011-08-31T09:53:19  <delt0r> steak is easy once you have a grill
2011-08-31T09:53:26  <antimatroid> delt0r: you've seen my maze maps yeah?
2011-08-31T09:53:27  <mcstar> delt0r: best i had, sorry :D
2011-08-31T09:53:35  <delt0r> antimatroid: no
2011-08-31T09:53:50  <antimatroid> http://ants.zeroviz.us/rLPKO/
2011-08-31T09:53:53  <antimatroid> they look like that :)
2011-08-31T09:53:58  <delt0r> mcstar: should involve cars or library's of congress
2011-08-31T09:54:18  <mcstar> ill think about it
2011-08-31T09:54:30  <delt0r> lol
2011-08-31T09:54:45  <delt0r> antimatroid: freaky --not sure many would like it however
2011-08-31T09:55:11  <delt0r> most simple bots would keep to themselves since they won't find their way out
2011-08-31T09:55:18  <antimatroid> http://ants.zeroviz.us/bLiMI/ that's a different kind of symmetry
2011-08-31T09:55:30  <delt0r> personally.. would be interesting
2011-08-31T09:55:44  <mcstar> thats a very very good map, for advanced bots
2011-08-31T09:56:09  <antimatroid> it'll make path finding more important
2011-08-31T09:56:20  <delt0r> path finding is easy peasy
2011-08-31T09:56:36  <antimatroid> http://www.reddit.com/r/Algebra/comments/j27dt/generating_tessellations_on_a_discrete_torus/
2011-08-31T09:56:42  <mcstar> i think its not that easy for a bot to recognize it is in a maze
2011-08-31T09:56:44  <antimatroid> that post explains how to make the maps
2011-08-31T09:56:45  <delt0r> A* and Div whatever that guys name is are pretty simple
2011-08-31T09:56:57  <mcstar> dijkstra
2011-08-31T09:56:57  <antimatroid> delt0r: it depends, my bot does A* with multiple sources and targets
2011-08-31T09:57:46  <antimatroid> with h(x) := min_* mdist(x, *) (* are food locations) for example
2011-08-31T09:57:52  <delt0r> again not such a hard extension. Information is still propagated over the graph. I would not expect it to be much more code
2011-08-31T09:58:05  <antimatroid> and i will re use ants when collecting food, including ants i expect to spawn from collecting food
2011-08-31T09:58:35  <antimatroid> using information about when they'll be available while searching
2011-08-31T09:59:05  <antimatroid> it's not that complicated, but it's good for beginners who haven't played with path finding before and offers quite a few options for people
2011-08-31T09:59:20  <antimatroid> the real complication comes with macro strategy and battling enemies imo
2011-08-31T09:59:27  <antimatroid> path finding is the best place to start though
2011-08-31T09:59:31  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@58.171.94.137> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-31T09:59:31  <delt0r> yea--
2011-08-31T09:59:54  <delt0r> keep the ground you have, or be aggressive and get more ground
2011-08-31T10:00:07  <delt0r> assemble hunting parties
2011-08-31T10:00:12  <delt0r> parties
2011-08-31T10:00:13  <antimatroid> hopefully the best bot will be agressive
2011-08-31T10:00:14  <delt0r> yea
2011-08-31T10:00:20  <antimatroid> otherwise i see a fairly boring contest :P
2011-08-31T10:00:50  <delt0r> if you get more of the map, then you have more food
2011-08-31T10:01:17  <antimatroid> yeah, i expect the better bots to be defensively agressive
2011-08-31T10:01:21  <mcstar> the best bot will utilize deception, ambush, suicide and luck too
2011-08-31T10:01:22  <delt0r> you can just sit tight if survival is the goal
2011-08-31T10:01:26  <antimatroid> i'm just not sure how that will go when they play each other
2011-08-31T10:01:44  <antimatroid> deception and ambushing are things i would like to see
2011-08-31T10:01:59  <mcstar> (i want a bot that brings enemies closer together)
2011-08-31T10:02:21  <delt0r> you don't want to do that... you want to spread their line --surly
2011-08-31T10:02:28  <delt0r> surely
2011-08-31T10:02:43  <mcstar> i want them to battle against each other, not with me
2011-08-31T10:02:44  <antimatroid> you can use a single ant to lead enemies away from your "swarms", or in particular path so it's surrounded by your "swarms" which would look sweet
2011-08-31T10:03:06  <antimatroid> then swoop in from outside view
2011-08-31T10:03:07  <mcstar> and dont call me Surely
2011-08-31T10:03:14  <mcstar> :D
2011-08-31T10:05:59  <mcstar> pfff, people dont like humor anymore
2011-08-31T10:06:10  <delt0r> if a bot times out, does the orders it sent before timing out still get carried out?
2011-08-31T10:06:36  <antimatroid> delt0r: hmmmm :P i hope not
2011-08-31T10:07:09  <mcstar> you mean the bot times out in between sending output?
2011-08-31T10:07:14  <berak> shure, that was one turn before
2011-08-31T10:07:16  <antimatroid> the only reason their ants stay in the game is to try and minimise teritory advantage to neighbouring bots
2011-08-31T10:07:40  <delt0r> yea --its sending its orders... then the time is up. So now its send orders, but has timed out.
2011-08-31T10:07:40  <antimatroid> although we can make 5 player games where you can remove any subset of the players and the game remains symmetric
2011-08-31T10:08:15  <mcstar> the engine waits for the bot's go signal
2011-08-31T10:08:21  <delt0r> ie it didn't get to the go
2011-08-31T10:08:28  <mcstar> so if it never came, the orders cannot be carried out
2011-08-31T10:08:41  <delt0r> yea but i currently process orders as the arrive
2011-08-31T10:08:55  <mcstar> you shouldnt, if you think it matters
2011-08-31T10:09:01  <delt0r> that is not implied in the game definition.
2011-08-31T10:09:04  <antimatroid> i said, we can make 5 player maps .. does that not blow anyone elses mind?
2011-08-31T10:09:11  <mcstar> no
2011-08-31T10:09:12  <delt0r> in fact nothing is really implied
2011-08-31T10:09:14  <mcstar> sorry

2011-08-31T10:09:35  <delt0r> antimatroid: I support 256 players in plantwars
2011-08-31T10:09:51  <antimatroid> good luck running that on the servers
2011-08-31T10:09:58  <antimatroid> i'd be interested to see a tcp server doing that
2011-08-31T10:10:02  <a1k0n> plantwars?

2011-08-31T10:10:48  <antimatroid> ants can handle up to 26

2011-08-31T10:11:22  <delt0r> or 2^31
2011-08-31T10:11:25  <antimatroid> uses a-z for the starting positions
2011-08-31T10:11:27  <mcstar> a-b,A-Z?
2011-08-31T10:11:30  <delt0r> which ever comes first
2011-08-31T10:11:32  <antimatroid> it could be fixed with a few changes I think
2011-08-31T10:11:33  <mcstar> thats 52
2011-08-31T10:11:45  <antimatroid> just pass the map without ant info and pass ants like parameters

2011-08-31T10:12:58  <mcstar> antimatroid: you dont really need to designate different starting positions with different letters
2011-08-31T10:13:15  <delt0r> well that could have been done with say.... ant start positions... spaw point if you will. Then let them get picked randomly.. or have a start ant list at the end
2011-08-31T10:13:29  <antimatroid> yes i do, because then you can have maps with more than one starting ant per player
2011-08-31T10:13:31  <delt0r> s/spaw/span
2011-08-31T10:13:50  <mcstar> :S do you want that?
2011-08-31T10:13:50  <delt0r> you can with this too
2011-08-31T10:13:51  <antimatroid> which is at least vital for debugging purposes
2011-08-31T10:14:23  <delt0r> internally i have a map + a list of ants and food for the intial start
2011-08-31T10:15:12  <antimatroid> yeah my bot has a vector of locations for myAnts, enemyAnts and food
2011-08-31T10:15:29  <antimatroid> i also need oldFood to track food information outside of view

2011-08-31T10:16:04  <delt0r> well what do you know.. i do ignore commands already sent if the bot times out
2011-08-31T10:16:36  <antimatroid> seems the correct thing to do yeah?
2011-08-31T10:17:12  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be opposed to setting a timed out bots score to zero, although i agree with mcleopold in that we're testing peoples ability to write ai and not program
2011-08-31T10:17:28  <delt0r> tbh --i think the spec is not clear --but its what the current github does too
2011-08-31T10:17:53  <delt0r> so that seems to be trumps
2011-08-31T10:19:12  <mcstar> antimatroid: i see you are practicing touc-typing, hence not using tab
2011-08-31T10:19:15  <mcstar> h

2011-08-31T10:23:50  <antimatroid> delt0r: I added a paragraph to the end of the "endbot conditions" of the specs page
2011-08-31T10:24:07  <antimatroid> "If a bot crashes or times out on a given turn then none of the moves received from that bot will be executed for that turn, nor will it receive any points for that turn."
2011-08-31T10:25:58  <mcstar> hm, i really think this is implied, in the input format section however

2011-08-31T10:42:33  <antimatroid> it's a beefed up version of the c++ starter bot i wrote

2011-08-31T10:43:02  <deeper-blue> hehe, I used the c++ starter bot first but then rewrote everything in C to fit my style

2011-08-31T10:47:02  <deeper-blue> and I think it's the most feasible one :)
2011-08-31T10:47:22  <antimatroid> i'm a game theory fan, so i want to use that when possible :P
2011-08-31T10:47:25  <deeper-blue> I think there're too many variables to optimize
2011-08-31T10:47:40  <antimatroid> yeah, I tried for a long long time to solve planet wars
2011-08-31T10:47:42  <deeper-blue> well at least for a full bruteforce attempt :D
2011-08-31T10:47:53  <antimatroid> it's an interesting problem but a ridiculously hard one, I had some crazy ideas :P
2011-08-31T10:48:13  <deeper-blue> I like how different it is from the planetwars thing
2011-08-31T10:48:31  <antimatroid> it offers more depth for aiey things to work on
2011-08-31T10:48:40  <antimatroid> it's not as cool to watch though :\
2011-08-31T10:48:54  <deeper-blue> i think it will become more interesting to watch!
2011-08-31T10:48:58  <deeper-blue> when bots get better
2011-08-31T10:49:01  <antimatroid> i still think tron  is my favourite, it was so simple and neat
2011-08-31T10:49:19  <deeper-blue> ants is super complex
2011-08-31T10:49:30  <antimatroid> i wanted it to be more complex :P
2011-08-31T10:49:34  <deeper-blue> :)
2011-08-31T10:49:46  <deeper-blue> when I heard ants
2011-08-31T10:49:56  <deeper-blue> I first expected that one has to carry food home
2011-08-31T10:50:00  <antimatroid> have to harvest grains and return them to base to spawn more ants, ants had hp which you could fuse friend ants to sum and you had to attack enemies
2011-08-31T10:50:01  <deeper-blue> and things like that
2011-08-31T10:50:05  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-08-31T10:50:08  <deeper-blue> ^^
2011-08-31T10:50:15  <antimatroid> it was like future cop lapd preccint assault
2011-08-31T10:50:20  <antimatroid> best playstation game ever
2011-08-31T10:50:20  <deeper-blue> :D
2011-08-31T10:50:32  <antimatroid> it was deemed too complicated :(
2011-08-31T10:50:49  <deeper-blue> well, this ants is a good compromise
2011-08-31T10:50:54  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-08-31T10:51:00  <antimatroid> i really like the battle resolution for this
2011-08-31T10:51:06  <deeper-blue> but I would call it more 'bacteria' than ants ;)
2011-08-31T10:51:17  <antimatroid> bacteria can path find? :P
2011-08-31T10:51:24  <deeper-blue> hehe
2011-08-31T10:51:28  <deeper-blue> well
2011-08-31T10:51:41  <deeper-blue> I mean the finding food and spawning and offspring :D
