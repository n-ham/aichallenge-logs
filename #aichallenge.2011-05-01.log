2011-05-01T05:43:16  <antimatroid> i'm with mcstar
2011-05-01T05:43:26  <antimatroid> you need to fix the silence
2011-05-01T05:44:01  <antimatroid> here's something for people to discuss with me...
2011-05-01T05:44:13  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_pennies
2011-05-01T05:44:21  <antimatroid> that game is not symmetric under any definition i have
2011-05-01T05:51:31  <mcstar> reading the introduction i must conclude that it is
2011-05-01T05:51:56  <antimatroid> why?
2011-05-01T05:52:20  <mcstar> i could alsa ask why not?
2011-05-01T05:52:38  <antimatroid> most people define a game as symmetric if it remains unchanged from a permutation of the players
2011-05-01T05:52:44  <antimatroid> i generalise that
2011-05-01T05:52:58  <antimatroid> and require there exists some permutation of players strategies that allows that property
2011-05-01T05:53:08  <antimatroid> but even if i generalise like that, matching pennies is not symmetric
2011-05-01T05:53:30  <mcstar> (h,h)(h,t)(t,h)(t,t)
2011-05-01T05:53:46  <mcstar> if (h,h)or(t,t) A wins
2011-05-01T05:53:54  <mcstar> if (t,h)or(h,t) B wins
2011-05-01T05:54:12  <mcstar> i dont see any problem with this
2011-05-01T05:54:20  <antimatroid> the game is fair yes
2011-05-01T05:54:23  <antimatroid> but it's not symmetric
2011-05-01T05:54:31  <antimatroid> you can't premute the players and get the same game back
2011-05-01T05:54:52  <antimatroid> the role of player 1 and player 2 are opposite, player 1 is trying to match strategies while player 2 is trying to not match them
2011-05-01T05:56:34  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-05-01T05:57:10  <mcstar> even the payoff matrix is symmetric
2011-05-01T05:57:15  <antimatroid> it's not
2011-05-01T05:57:31  <antimatroid> well the payoff matrices are symmetric
2011-05-01T05:57:40  <antimatroid> but the players payoff matrices aren't transposes of each other
2011-05-01T05:57:41  <mcstar> so the game is fair
2011-05-01T05:57:52  <antimatroid> which is the 2 player condition for symmetric game
2011-05-01T05:57:59  <antimatroid> without considering permutations of strategies
2011-05-01T05:58:55  <antimatroid> intuitively I want to scream but it's obviously symmetric
2011-05-01T05:59:02  <antimatroid> but the definitions that seem most intuitive disagree
2011-05-01T05:59:23  <mcstar> u mean asymmetric
2011-05-01T05:59:34  <antimatroid> no?
2011-05-01T05:59:52  <mcstar> that game is not symmetric under any definition i have
2011-05-01T05:59:54  <antimatroid> the game seems like it should be symmetric, but the intuitive definitions for symmetry of a game imply it shouldn't be smmetric
2011-05-01T05:59:57  <mcstar> quoting u
2011-05-01T06:00:01  <antimatroid> exactly
2011-05-01T06:00:23  <antimatroid> but intuitively the game looks like it should be "symmetric" yes?
2011-05-01T06:00:23  <mcstar> so
2011-05-01T06:00:55  <mcstar> i guess it means that player A should have a different startegy than player B
2011-05-01T06:01:10  <mcstar> so its not like the prisoner dilemma
2011-05-01T06:01:19  <antimatroid> ?
2011-05-01T06:01:23  <antimatroid> prisoners dilemma is symmetric
2011-05-01T06:01:27  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-01T06:01:33  <mcstar> but this games seems it isnt
2011-05-01T06:01:38  <antimatroid> although if PD = (A, B), i'm unsure about whether (A, 2B) should be symmetric
2011-05-01T06:01:46  <antimatroid> the structure of the game is very much the same
2011-05-01T06:01:58  <antimatroid> the best response corresponses are the "same" i'm pretty sure
2011-05-01T06:02:08  <mcstar> hey u lost me there
2011-05-01T06:02:18  <antimatroid> PD = prisoners dilemma
2011-05-01T06:02:46  <antimatroid> if A = [2, 1; 4, 3] and B = [2, 3; 1, 4] then (A, B) gives PD
2011-05-01T06:03:00  <antimatroid> but if you take 2B, then (A, 2B) pretty much gives the same game
2011-05-01T06:03:23  <antimatroid> but then you don't have A = (2B)^T
2011-05-01T06:03:56  <antimatroid> i'm trying to come up with definitions of equivalence and symmetry that allows "nice" partitions of games into classes
2011-05-01T06:06:21  <antimatroid> i was thinking before, could we actually solve for a mixed strategy that dominated a pure strategy with our fourier-motzkin thing?

2011-05-01T06:07:00  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-01T06:07:17  <mcstar> i really cant discuss this with you :)
2011-05-01T06:07:35  <antimatroid> i know, i was just looking for more opinions on matchings pennies
2011-05-01T06:07:45  <antimatroid> i had always just assumed it is symmetric

2011-05-01T10:55:55  <bhasker> btw
2011-05-01T10:56:01  <bhasker> given that spawn radius is sqrt(2)
2011-05-01T10:56:11  <bhasker> shouldn't diagonal squares cause an ant to spawn as well
2011-05-01T10:56:28  <bhasker> right now the engine doesn't spawn ants if you are diagonally adjacent
2011-05-01T10:56:59  <bhasker> looking at the code i think this is the function that is to blame for that
2011-05-01T10:57:06  <bhasker>     def nearby_ants(self, loc, max_dist, exclude=None):
2011-05-01T10:57:07  <bhasker>         """ Returns ants where 0 < dist to loc <= sqrt(max_dist)
2011-05-01T10:57:16  <bhasker> we should probably add an epsilon to max_dist
2011-05-01T10:57:21  <antimatroid> spawn radius is sqrt(1)
2011-05-01T10:57:24  <bhasker> to make sure diagonal squares cause spawn
2011-05-01T10:57:29  <bhasker> the spec says sqrt(2)
2011-05-01T10:57:35  <antimatroid> specs is old :P
2011-05-01T10:57:38  <bhasker> ..
2011-05-01T10:57:39  <bhasker> :p
2011-05-01T10:58:09  <antimatroid> we have spawn2 = 1, battle2 = 4 and view2 = 55

2011-05-01T20:51:51  <bhasker> well this is a rather basic bot, nothing too fancy but it can beat my basic bfs searcher bot
2011-05-01T20:52:06  <jaycobcoleman> What language is it in?

2011-05-01T21:08:56  <bhasker> the other 3 are just a basic bfs searcher
2011-05-01T21:09:16  <jaycobcoleman> okay
2011-05-01T21:10:18  <jaycobcoleman> were the others just searching for closest food or ant?

2011-05-01T21:11:15  <bhasker> and do a simple bfs
