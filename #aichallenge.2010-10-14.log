2010-10-14T00:02:40  <deepblue> i make on the fly changes on my bot right now - expect varying results :)
2010-10-14T00:03:03  <deepblue> how many lines does your bot use?
2010-10-14T00:03:22  <rebelxt_> i am going to unlock fireworks mode just for fun
2010-10-14T00:04:18  <deepblue> fireworks?
2010-10-14T00:04:23  <deepblue> sounds good to me
2010-10-14T00:04:25  <rebelxt_> me? 400 LOC not counting alternative starter kit
2010-10-14T00:05:49  <bhasker> who the heck is pmnl
2010-10-14T00:05:52  <bhasker> kicking my bots butt
2010-10-14T00:05:53  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-14T00:05:54  <rebelxt_> deepblue: sorry fireworks mode broken atm :(
2010-10-14T00:05:58  <deepblue> without starter kit I at around 600 to 800
2010-10-14T00:06:13  <deepblue> don't know exactly
2010-10-14T00:06:30  <deepblue> tons of uncommented lines and unused functions :D
2010-10-14T00:06:31  <jukkerknott_> same
2010-10-14T00:06:48  <jukkerknott_> that bot just appeared, i faced it with -999999elo. shocked me.
2010-10-14T00:07:18  <bhasker> funny game
2010-10-14T00:07:22  <bhasker> interesting bot this pmnl
2010-10-14T00:07:31  <bhasker> he is doing some kind of find enemies weakest planet
2010-10-14T00:07:33  <bhasker> and hit them
2010-10-14T00:07:36  <rebelxt_> i just lost a game to pmnl too
2010-10-14T00:07:36  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=477649
2010-10-14T00:07:38  <bhasker> check the game out
2010-10-14T00:09:11  <rebelxt_> bhasker: awesome game!
2010-10-14T00:09:15  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-14T00:09:19  <bhasker> quite an interesting one
2010-10-14T00:09:27  <bhasker> that bot is quite an interesting one
2010-10-14T00:09:34  <bhasker> always goes for the weakest spot
2010-10-14T00:10:37  <rebelxt_> you don't try to defend 1-growth planets, do you?

2010-10-14T00:11:58  <bhasker> not really
2010-10-14T00:12:04  <bhasker> well actually
2010-10-14T00:12:13  <bhasker> its just that by the time i get to the 1 growth planet
2010-10-14T00:12:17  <bhasker> i don't have ships left
2010-10-14T00:12:18  <bhasker> to send
2010-10-14T00:12:46  <bhasker> if my bot thinks it can get a 4 growth planet from the enemy it will sacrifice the 1 growth
2010-10-14T00:12:51  <bhasker> or even a 3 growth
2010-10-14T00:13:09  <bhasker> my estimation for how many ships i need to get that is slightly off
2010-10-14T00:13:14  <bhasker> i don't compensate enough for reinforcements
2010-10-14T00:14:41  <rebelxt_> oh my, pmnl is getting my ass kicked atm
2010-10-14T00:14:54  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-14T00:15:47  <deepblue> i;m happy I beat him more than he's beating me ;)
2010-10-14T00:16:01  <jukkerknott_> any word on McLeopolds new bot?
2010-10-14T00:17:21  <rebelxt_> coming soon to a server near you
2010-10-14T00:17:27  <rebelxt_> ;-)
2010-10-14T00:17:53  <jukkerknott_> nice. i'm interested in seeing his new strategies... his old bot is still performing quite well
2010-10-14T00:18:00  <deepblue> leopold only played one gam
2010-10-14T00:18:13  <deepblue> and he basically sits it out :D
2010-10-14T00:18:41  <rebelxt_> his bot was #1 but yeah it's amazing it's still doing well
2010-10-14T00:18:50  <jukkerknott_> ah. gonna make sure he destroys everybody before letting it run havoc on us ;)
2010-10-14T00:20:57  <deepblue> narf some bug somewhere

2010-10-14T01:02:36  <McLeopold> hello contestants
2010-10-14T01:03:42  <McLeopold> I've got a funny story, if anyone is interested.
2010-10-14T01:04:20  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=478467
2010-10-14T01:04:24  <McLeopold> It's more for self theropy than humor that I need to tell someone.
2010-10-14T01:04:25  <bhasker> i am interseted
2010-10-14T01:04:42  <McLeopold> So, I *finally* figured out my performance problem.
2010-10-14T01:04:51  <McLeopold> I left cProfile running...
2010-10-14T01:04:56  <bhasker> haha
2010-10-14T01:05:08  <McLeopold> After 2 days of re-write...
2010-10-14T01:05:12  <bhasker> are you guys really running into timeouts though?
2010-10-14T01:05:23  <bhasker> you must be doing something awfully complicated that you need cProfile:-\
2010-10-14T01:05:32  <bhasker> my python bot doesn't run into timeouts
2010-10-14T01:05:33  <McLeopold> Yeah, I am.
2010-10-14T01:05:41  <bhasker> makes me feel stupid:(
2010-10-14T01:05:55  <McLeopold> If I turn it off, it should be *really* fast now.
2010-10-14T01:06:10  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what the hell are you doing to use time up?
2010-10-14T01:06:26  <McLeopold> What's the emoticon for crying with your hands in your face?
2010-10-14T01:06:26  <antimatroid> i am using next to nothing, and plan to keep it that way until i'm using a tree, at which point i'll be using most of my time
2010-10-14T01:06:42  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-14T01:06:44  <bhasker> :((
2010-10-14T01:06:46  <bhasker> hmm no
2010-10-14T01:06:53  <McLeopold> :=(
2010-10-14T01:08:05  <McLeopold> antimatroid: basically, make a move, see if I like the results, unmake a move, rinse, repeat
2010-10-14T01:08:32  <McLeopold> same stuff you would do with a tree, but more of a knapsack problem solver
2010-10-14T01:08:38  <bhasker> i am interested in seeing how that works out
2010-10-14T01:08:43  <McLeopold> me too!
2010-10-14T01:09:11  <McLeopold> It only slows down during complicated games.
2010-10-14T01:09:16  <antimatroid> ah fair enough, i tried running a dp approach on all possible moves, but that was obviously way too slow
2010-10-14T01:09:18  <McLeopold> It's usually really fast.
2010-10-14T01:09:50  <antimatroid> once you had a few hundred planets and a few ships it just blew out
2010-10-14T01:10:22  <bhasker> few hundred planets?
2010-10-14T01:10:33  <bhasker> mmm most maps are with 23 planets?
2010-10-14T01:10:43  <McLeopold> bhasker: how come you changed your tcp name?
2010-10-14T01:10:51  <McLeopold> and nice defense
2010-10-14T01:10:55  <antimatroid> few hundred ships***
2010-10-14T01:11:07  <bhasker> just like that renamed the bot after one of my favourite books
2010-10-14T01:11:07  <antimatroid> and a few planets**

2010-10-14T01:12:39  <bhasker> weird game http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=478571
2010-10-14T01:12:51  <bhasker> lost it by one ship:-\
2010-10-14T01:12:58  <antimatroid> have way too much uni work atm, but tomorrow is the last day of semester and i have almost 3 weeks from my last exam to the end of the contest :D
2010-10-14T01:13:21  <antimatroid> i've had quite a few games of late where i think the outcome would have switched if given more time
2010-10-14T01:13:31  <antimatroid> before it wasn't really happening so thought 200 was fairly reasonable
2010-10-14T01:13:43  <antimatroid> but i would say i had at least 5 or 6 games like that in the last few days
2010-10-14T01:15:13  <McLeopold> bhasker: you should check for that condition
2010-10-14T01:15:33  <bhasker> yea thinking of doing something for situations like this
2010-10-14T01:15:40  <bhasker> and do something like try and launch to take a planet
2010-10-14T01:15:43  <bhasker> or something
2010-10-14T01:15:48  <bhasker> or a new neutral
2010-10-14T01:16:06  <McLeopold> a new neutral would have been safest in that game
2010-10-14T01:16:12  <McLeopold> the 45 in the back
2010-10-14T01:16:41  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-14T01:16:56  <McLeopold> then, once you are 73 ships up, you can launch toward the center and hold it.
2010-10-14T01:17:26  <antimatroid> i wont touch a neutral that isn't closer to me than the enemy
2010-10-14T01:17:43  <McLeopold> if you have 1000 ships more, it usually doesn't hurt to try
2010-10-14T01:17:51  <antimatroid> although there are cases that is suboptimal, it's just how it's done atm
2010-10-14T01:18:05  <antimatroid> if i have 1000 more then i expect to win anyway
2010-10-14T01:18:13  <McLeopold> I think solving that problem will win the contest, atm.
2010-10-14T01:18:30  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-14T01:18:55  <McLeopold> let me find a game that I saw that scares me
2010-10-14T01:19:02  <antimatroid> i'm not sure about that, you also need to do best expansion, redistribution etc. etc.
2010-10-14T01:19:11  <antimatroid> there are quite a few components to the game, i really like it
2010-10-14T01:23:13  <McLeopold> hmm... I can't seem to find it
2010-10-14T01:24:36  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=467310
2010-10-14T01:24:40  <McLeopold> there it is
2010-10-14T01:25:27  <McLeopold> I wonder who v14.1.1.99 is?
2010-10-14T01:26:44  <bhasker> i dont understand whats scary about that one
2010-10-14T01:27:05  <bhasker> the other bot never contested middle
2010-10-14T01:30:14  <bhasker> mcleopold you running your bot now?
2010-10-14T01:30:30  <Zannick> okay
2010-10-14T01:30:35  <Zannick> that took a little while
2010-10-14T01:30:59  <Zannick> but now i have open-sourced my small scripts
2010-10-14T01:31:02  <Zannick> and copybot
2010-10-14T01:31:39  <McLeopold> No, still working on bugs.
2010-10-14T01:31:44  <McLeopold> And performance.
2010-10-14T01:31:50  <McLeopold> Maybe in an hour or so...
2010-10-14T01:32:07  <McLeopold> Cool, I'd like to see copy bot.
2010-10-14T01:37:12  <Zannick> sorry, had to fix the Makefile real quick

2010-10-14T01:47:18  <Zannick> i used the way guaranteed by the map generator >.>
2010-10-14T01:47:27  <sigh> :)
2010-10-14T01:48:08  <sigh> fails for planet 0?
2010-10-14T01:48:32  <Zannick> the function does, but DoTurn avoids that
2010-10-14T01:49:00  <sigh> ah, yeah
2010-10-14T01:49:31  <sigh> also, I thought you were using c :P
2010-10-14T01:49:32  <antimatroid> hmmm, i think i could take out the prize for most entries to the main server
2010-10-14T01:49:40  <Zannick> i switched way after copybot
2010-10-14T01:50:02  <sigh> why did you switch?
2010-10-14T01:50:07  <Zannick> also i'm not going to share my c backend just yet
2010-10-14T01:50:23  <antimatroid> i thought people wanted code kept private till the end of the contest?
2010-10-14T01:50:42  <Zannick> i'm more comfortable with c, and i wanted better control over stuff
2010-10-14T01:50:46  <antimatroid> such that the standard isn't set by the best bot released
2010-10-14T01:50:55  <Zannick> antimatroid: i released /copybot/
2010-10-14T01:51:03  <Zannick> it's in the bottom 1/3
2010-10-14T01:51:05  <antimatroid> ah, dw :)
2010-10-14T01:51:33  <sigh> Zannick: you are ruining the competition for 1/3 of the entries!
2010-10-14T01:51:34  <Zannick> probably most of its wins due to the other player failing :P
2010-10-14T01:51:34  <sigh> :P
2010-10-14T01:51:58  <Zannick> it draws against ragebot or idlebot
2010-10-14T01:52:01  <Zannick> :D
2010-10-14T01:52:09  <antimatroid> i wonder how many bots are up now, you don't neceesarily see with tied elo scores existing
2010-10-14T01:52:11  <Zannick> well, no
2010-10-14T01:52:22  <Zannick> it draws against ragebot if the starting planets are 20 or more away
2010-10-14T01:53:15  <sigh> hmmm... does it really win against ragebot?
2010-10-14T01:53:23  <Zannick> no, it loses
2010-10-14T01:53:24  <sigh> isn't there a turn when ragebot owns both planets
2010-10-14T01:53:33  <sigh> *i mean draw
2010-10-14T01:53:50  <Zannick> it draws if the planets are sufficient distance that ragebot can't conquer it
2010-10-14T01:53:58  <antimatroid> sigh: if you gain enough in the time taken for it to get to you, you don't lose your planet
2010-10-14T01:53:59  <sigh> ah yes... makes sense
2010-10-14T01:54:05  <Zannick> hm
2010-10-14T01:54:10  <sigh> yeah, I see it now
2010-10-14T01:54:13  <sigh> sorry, I am slow
2010-10-14T01:54:29  <Zannick> that might not work, though, since ragebot would send non-100 amounts
2010-10-14T01:54:33  <Zannick> i haven't actually checked
2010-10-14T01:54:39  <Zannick> (ragebot probably wins)
2010-10-14T01:55:09  <antimatroid> there would be a set distance at which you are safe
2010-10-14T01:55:15  <antimatroid> the game is nice and linear like that
2010-10-14T01:55:23  * Zannick shrug
2010-10-14T01:55:43  <Zannick> anyway, the only way copybot wins if it breaks the symmetry
2010-10-14T01:55:56  <Zannick> and the only way it breaks the symmetry is if the other player does.
2010-10-14T01:56:40  <Zannick> so, either: takes planet 0, or a planet and its mirror, in such a way that copybot's response takes both
2010-10-14T01:56:55  <sigh> ok, I know this is from the main contest code... but why is it called a sadbox?

2010-10-14T10:22:36  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=485073
2010-10-14T10:22:42  <bhasker> that 5 growth planet
2010-10-14T10:22:45  <bhasker> you keep losing every time
2010-10-14T10:22:48  <bhasker> because you send ships out
2010-10-14T10:22:51  <bhasker> when there are more incoming
2010-10-14T10:24:46  <rebelxt_> bhasker: yeah every bot of mine has this bug ;-) need to fix
2010-10-14T10:25:06  <bhasker> a simple fix that i do is , that if i ever lose control of the plane tin the future
2010-10-14T10:25:08  <bhasker> i never send out ships
2010-10-14T10:25:11  <bhasker> from that planet
2010-10-14T10:25:18  <bhasker> seems to work just fine
2010-10-14T10:25:24  <bhasker> just walk through all the future states
2010-10-14T10:25:26  <bhasker> and if you lose control
2010-10-14T10:25:29  <bhasker> don't send out ships
2010-10-14T10:25:38  <bhasker> you will only accelerate the loss
2010-10-14T10:27:19  <rebelxt_> i do future simulation and calc avail ships too. this bug is caused by enemy's planet being one turn closer to my 5-growth than my main funnel
2010-10-14T10:27:56  <bhasker> ah
2010-10-14T10:28:58  <rebelxt_> should be a one line fix - glad you noticed this

2010-10-14T11:15:47  <dmj111> for the moment, it won't sound like sour grapes, but I kind of wish old submissions were kept in the rating process.  (maybe they are but I doubt it.)
2010-10-14T11:16:13  <JamesMG> as separate entries?
2010-10-14T11:16:17  <dmj111> yes.
2010-10-14T11:16:32  <JamesMG> that would be fun, more bots to play
2010-10-14T11:16:43  <JamesMG> servers would never get through a round at their current rate though
2010-10-14T11:16:55  <dmj111> well... I would not keep them active, but keep their history in the data that bayeselo processes.
2010-10-14T11:17:01  <JamesMG> ah
2010-10-14T11:17:32  <dmj111> I saw that happen with my old one.  As people who had beat me resubmitted, my rating went up, without my bot playing any additional games.
2010-10-14T11:18:25  <dmj111> I don't know if that is a practical idea or not.

2010-10-14T11:20:04  <cfaftw> dmj111, that's interesting... if that's the case they should store historical rankings for submissions
2010-10-14T11:20:45  <dmj111> yeah... it would give a rating comparison between entries.
2010-10-14T11:20:49  <dmj111> of the same person.
2010-10-14T11:20:50  <cfaftw> although, practically i guess it doesn't matter since come nov 27, everyone will have a blank slate and there will be no more submissions
2010-10-14T11:21:12  <cfaftw> i view the current state of the rankings as a very rough estimate
2010-10-14T11:21:12  <dmj111> Yes.  It would just be to make the leaderboard more stable during this test phase.
2010-10-14T11:21:17  <dmj111> Yep.

2010-10-14T11:22:33  <mega1> since the playing styles of the current version evolve over time it can be argued that dropping old entries from the rating process is necessary to avoid misleading results

2010-10-14T11:24:25  <dmj111> Your point is a good point, mega1.  One of the things people do with these rating programs, though, is run big databases of chess games to find approximate ratings of players from different eras.  That is kind of imagining.
2010-10-14T11:24:54  <JamesMG> I think it's funny that the top rated C# entry is 60th right now
2010-10-14T11:25:08  <cfaftw> JamesMG, -_-
2010-10-14T11:25:14  <cfaftw> the C# community needs to pick it up
2010-10-14T11:25:36  <rebelxt_> there are still issues with C# entries losing on first turn sometimes. this might explain it
2010-10-14T11:25:44  <JamesMG> Oh, is that a C# thing?

2010-10-14T11:25:51  <Zannick> the c# community is frustrated at the c# compiler failing

2010-10-14T11:26:43  <JamesMG> the compiler thing is pretty frustrating, yeah
2010-10-14T11:26:49  <cfaftw> wow... once they fix that it could completely change the leaderboard
2010-10-14T11:27:21  <Naktibalda> it should
2010-10-14T11:27:33  <Naktibalda> there were a few C# bots in top10
2010-10-14T11:27:43  <rebelxt_> i think most c# people are about to either give up on the contest or already re-writing their bot in another lang
2010-10-14T11:28:13  <dmj111> C# on ubuntu8.04 is kind of a bad idea... I thought of using F#, but didn't want to have deal with the old mon.
2010-10-14T11:28:20  <Zannick> i'm not really sure anyone knows how to fix it
2010-10-14T11:28:24  <dmj111> Of course, I also like python much better.

2010-10-14T12:53:05  <cfaftw> mercurial?
2010-10-14T12:53:19  <lavalamp> yes, mercurial
2010-10-14T12:53:22  <HakanD> same here for git, i can't imagine working without it (:
2010-10-14T12:53:37  <lavalamp> I think git and hg are quite similar

2010-10-14T12:53:57  <HakanD> same philosophy
2010-10-14T12:54:07  <cfaftw> i'm still not using version control... which revision control software do you guys recommend for working with a local repository?
2010-10-14T12:54:30  <lavalamp> mercurial of course :) but git does that, too

2010-10-14T12:58:24  <lavalamp> I started using it because it's what the people that do golang use.
2010-10-14T12:58:36  <cfaftw> ok, which one is more windows friendly?

2010-10-14T13:24:55  <RenderMonkey> i did do javac

2010-10-14T13:25:19  <RenderMonkey> and i mean the visualizer does start

2010-10-14T13:26:04  <Zannick> do you have the jar files, too?
2010-10-14T13:26:14  <RenderMonkey> yes
2010-10-14T13:26:20  <RenderMonkey> they are under examples_bots
2010-10-14T13:26:24  <JamesMG> and when you java -jar example_bots/RageBot.jar it doesn't run, or sits at a prompt?
2010-10-14T13:26:29  <Naktibalda> don't start visualizer, just a playGame.jar
2010-10-14T13:26:55  <RenderMonkey> when i do java -jar example_bots/RageBot.jar
2010-10-14T13:26:58  <RenderMonkey> it just sits in the prompt
2010-10-14T13:27:12  <RenderMonkey> and like its waiting for cmds
2010-10-14T13:27:33  <RenderMonkey> or input / whatever
2010-10-14T13:27:58  <Zannick> and if you type "go" and hit enter, what happens?
2010-10-14T13:28:08  <RenderMonkey> nothing
2010-10-14T13:28:16  <Zannick> does it also say 'go'? so you'd have two in a row
2010-10-14T13:28:27  <RenderMonkey> no
2010-10-14T13:29:08  <JamesMG> "go" should tell it to execute it's DoTurn code, which should spit a "go" back at you
2010-10-14T13:29:28  <RenderMonkey> weird
2010-10-14T13:29:30  <RenderMonkey> so

2010-10-14T13:51:07  <lavalamp> yesterday I was thinking that optimal strategy should result in a draw... but this morning I found some evidence that maybe there isn't always an optimal strategy. I made a forum post: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=930&start=0
2010-10-14T13:53:22  <Frontier> lavalamp: I had a feeling. In fact when we talk about this on IRC most people agree that PlanetWars has a paper scissor rock element to it.
2010-10-14T13:54:16  <jmcarthur> i agree there optimal startegy's aren't necessarily going to draw against each other, but i disagree that it's a "rock paper scissor" element, unless by that people just mean that optimal strategies are mixed strategies

2010-10-14T13:54:32  <Frontier> jmcarthur: Logistics huh? The bots become more and more complex. Maybe next month we will see virtual court martials in the bots.
2010-10-14T13:54:54  <Zannick> court martial for not following orders
2010-10-14T13:55:05  <Frontier> jmcarthur: In the sense of "you wage one risk against another"
2010-10-14T13:55:08  <lavalamp> I'd like to court martial my bot

2010-10-14T13:56:55  <Frontier> So it is a pathfinding algorithm in the end with weighted connections between planets, right?
2010-10-14T13:57:27  <jmcarthur> essentially, i guess
2010-10-14T13:57:40  <jmcarthur> but involving many ships at many different starting and ending locations

2010-10-14T13:58:00  <jmcarthur> rather than the more typical one source, on destination pathfinding problem
2010-10-14T13:58:04  <jmcarthur> *one
2010-10-14T13:59:05  <jmcarthur> but really i think i'm only doing half of that problem. i have a separate algorithm determining how many ships i want sent where on what turn, and this one is just determining from where those ships should originate
2010-10-14T13:59:13  <cfaftw> lavalamp, just watched that game
2010-10-14T13:59:15  <cfaftw> it's interesting
2010-10-14T13:59:17  <cfaftw> i love this contest
2010-10-14T13:59:21  <jmcarthur> which turned out to be much more difficult for me to come up with!
2010-10-14T13:59:55  <lavalamp> jmcarthur, I split things like that, too, and agree that the latter is more difficult...
2010-10-14T13:59:56  <jmcarthur> because i wanted to minimize the maximum distance travelled for minimum response time
2010-10-14T14:00:24  <jmcarthur> my original algorithm would have been very, very slow...
2010-10-14T14:00:49  <jmcarthur> but this one i think should be worst case O(n^2), for n=planets
2010-10-14T14:00:57  <lavalamp> My bot doesn't do that yet at all, it just supplies ships from the first planet it finds them at (though it searches nearest planet first)
2010-10-14T14:01:13  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3708), Hazard(3707), felixcoto(3693), rsergio(3681), MariusCG(3671), deepblue(3613), savchenko(3609), davidjliu(3603), ruilov(3581), cfaftw(3557)
2010-10-14T14:01:37  <lavalamp> cfaftw, yeah, I thought it was a bug in my bot but it was doing everything I told it to... I'm still not sure what should happen on that game
2010-10-14T14:01:39  <cfaftw> yes... i'm back in it
2010-10-14T14:02:45  <cfaftw> the bot took a gamble going for that big planet
2010-10-14T14:02:49  <cfaftw> and the gamble paid off
2010-10-14T14:03:00  <lavalamp> Sigh, I'm assuming the server is still not accepting golang submissions :(
2010-10-14T14:03:22  <JamesMG> Wish we could recreate that match with Monty against RageBot
2010-10-14T14:04:03  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-14T14:04:08  <lavalamp> Yeah, it did, and I'm thinking now maybe I need to run some simulations or something to determine what's best on average
2010-10-14T14:04:44  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: i'm glad you finally found an example game that demonstrates my suspicions. i now feel justified in all the things i said before
2010-10-14T14:05:12  <lavalamp> Yeah, that game really changed the way I'm thinking about this.
2010-10-14T14:05:15  <jmcarthur> and in fact i bet that's not uncommon

2010-10-14T14:05:25  <lavalamp> I bet so, also
2010-10-14T14:05:43  <jmcarthur> i was just trying to find "smaller" games that demonstrated it all the way to the end game rather than just demonstrating it on a higher level like you did
2010-10-14T14:06:39  <cfaftw> it's a little frustrating that some decisions boil down to rock, paper, scissors
2010-10-14T14:06:44  <lavalamp> I wasn't even looking for examples of this, it hadn't occurred to me that it would be possible.
2010-10-14T14:06:51  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: i disagree. i think it's great
2010-10-14T14:06:56  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: because it's more complex than that
2010-10-14T14:07:09  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: you still have to assign appropriate odds to each decision
2010-10-14T14:07:23  <jmcarthur> which i think most bots still aren't doing but probably should
2010-10-14T14:08:06  <lavalamp> Yeah, it makes things a lot more complicated, as you can no longer simply calculate what is best, you have to look ahead and calculate probabilities, too (I guess)
2010-10-14T14:08:19  <jmcarthur> right
2010-10-14T14:08:54  <jmcarthur> contrary to what some may see it as, this doesn't reduce all your calculations to mere chance
2010-10-14T14:09:03  <jmcarthur> it rather inflates your calculations to include chance
2010-10-14T14:09:18  <cfaftw> but wouldn't probabilities only be valid if your bot played another bot that made decisions the same way?
2010-10-14T14:09:30  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: even more complex then :)
2010-10-14T14:09:32  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: and no
2010-10-14T14:09:52  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: for any given game state, there is a nash equilibrium :)
2010-10-14T14:09:58  <jmcarthur> it's just hard to find

2010-10-14T14:10:22  <jmcarthur> i just feel more justified in it now ;)
2010-10-14T14:10:37  <lavalamp> You have to calculate expected return for each of your choices vs each of their choices and pick the one that does the best on average, I guess
2010-10-14T14:10:38  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-14T14:11:39  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: no, you have to find optimal weights for those choices and then pick one randomly according to those weights
2010-10-14T14:12:05  <jmcarthur> not just pick the one that averages the best

2010-10-14T14:12:37  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: if you always pick the one that averages the best, your opponent could just assume that's what you will do and counter it appropriately
2010-10-14T14:12:47  <lavalamp> Good point
2010-10-14T14:12:58  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: google "mixed strategy"
2010-10-14T14:13:15  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: and "nash equilibrium"
2010-10-14T14:13:23  <lavalamp> I will do that
2010-10-14T14:13:55  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, that sounds like chance, then
2010-10-14T14:14:02  <lavalamp> Maybe I will look at source code from that rock-paper-scissors competition, too... >.<
2010-10-14T14:14:06  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: but you are optimizing your chances
2010-10-14T14:14:13  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: rather than just tossing it to the wind
2010-10-14T14:15:13  <cfaftw> yes, but not against an equally performing bot that also uses mixed strategy
2010-10-14T14:15:44  <jmcarthur> in which case you will draw *on average*
2010-10-14T14:16:12  <jmcarthur> but there is still that element of skill, otherwise you wouldn't have had to qualify it with "equally performing"
2010-10-14T14:17:54  <JamesMG> lavalamp: are you pwwax?  I forgot who's that is
2010-10-14T14:18:11  <lavalamp> Yeah that's me
2010-10-14T14:19:07  <lavalamp> I think if you face multiple rock-paper-scissor decisions in a game, you can try and make a guess as to what they'll do based on what they did for previous ones

2010-10-14T14:19:25  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's a way to exploit the non-randomness of an opponent
2010-10-14T14:19:29  <lavalamp> So only the first decision needs to be totally random
2010-10-14T14:19:38  <jmcarthur> and if other bots do the same, that is the benefit of having randomness :)
2010-10-14T14:20:03  <lavalamp> *just finished reading the wikipedia mixed strategy article*
2010-10-14T14:20:11  <jmcarthur> even the first decision could be only semi-random
2010-10-14T14:20:25  <jmcarthur> based on measured statistics of bots currently in play that you could have done beforeuploading
2010-10-14T14:20:28  <jmcarthur> *before uploading
2010-10-14T14:20:35  <lavalamp> right

2010-10-14T14:21:34  <lavalamp> of course this assumes your bot can even detect this situation, which mine sure doesn't...

2010-10-14T14:44:08  <cfaftw> why not
2010-10-14T14:44:15  <cfaftw> you still have a month and a half :D

2010-10-14T14:48:34  <cfaftw> lavalamp, i ran the numbers on that one map you linked
2010-10-14T14:48:50  <lavalamp> did I make a math error?
2010-10-14T14:48:58  <cfaftw> if you sent all 100 ships to that 90-5 planet, then sent a stream of 5-fleets to it, it couldn't have been sniped
2010-10-14T14:49:06  <cfaftw> ... unless i made a mistake
2010-10-14T14:49:21  <cfaftw> distance of you to that planet is 11, distance of him to planet is 19
2010-10-14T14:49:21  <jmcarthur> eep, that's an investment there
2010-10-14T14:49:28  <lavalamp> really? I calculated I was 9 short
2010-10-14T14:49:29  <Zannick> not really
2010-10-14T14:49:34  <cfaftw> oh my bad
2010-10-14T14:49:36  <lavalamp> ah, I have his distance as being 20
2010-10-14T14:49:36  <cfaftw> he can snipe it
2010-10-14T14:49:49  <cfaftw> i was only considering him waiting one turn
2010-10-14T14:49:51  <Zannick> you don't have to send the stream, you can just wait until he tries to snipe
2010-10-14T14:49:51  <cfaftw> :)
2010-10-14T14:50:01  <cfaftw> zannick, also true
2010-10-14T14:51:28  <lavalamp> wait, no, I have him arriving at turn 20 (and my turn numbers are 1 based) so we agree
2010-10-14T14:51:52  <cfaftw> yeah, for some reason i got waiting a turn stuck in my head
2010-10-14T14:52:13  <lavalamp> you have to think crazier ^^
2010-10-14T14:52:38  <Zannick> to calculate a worse case you basically want to assume he knows what you do this turn
2010-10-14T14:52:38  <cfaftw> i have to think ragebot
2010-10-14T14:52:45  <jmcarthur> so the conclusion is that the suicide move isn't worth it because it can be absolutely countered?
2010-10-14T14:52:47  <lavalamp> Yeah
2010-10-14T14:53:23  <lavalamp> maybe I should take the corresponding 90-5 planet near him!
2010-10-14T14:53:35  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-14T14:53:38  <jmcarthur> what if he antisnipes?
2010-10-14T14:53:38  <lavalamp> if I send all of my ships there...
2010-10-14T14:53:39  <Zannick> except you do that, he snipes you.
2010-10-14T14:53:41  <cfaftw> you'd better hope he also goes for it first turn
2010-10-14T14:53:47  <Zannick> with much less effort
2010-10-14T14:54:05  <Zannick> unless he goes for it first turn, too :P
2010-10-14T14:54:21  <lavalamp> argh too complicated
2010-10-14T14:54:28  <Zannick> in both cases you are relying on him doing something very specific
2010-10-14T14:54:52  <Zannick> so i would rather have my bot go for my 90 than his
2010-10-14T14:55:47  <lavalamp> But if he assumes you'll do that, he can snipe
2010-10-14T14:56:22  <Zannick> i didn't say that would be the best move
2010-10-14T14:56:54  <lavalamp> My bot agreed that it wasn't
2010-10-14T14:56:56  <Zannick> your other option is to 2-step it
2010-10-14T14:57:21  <lavalamp> hm...
2010-10-14T14:57:23  <Zannick> send a small amount first turn, then send a capturing fleet once you see what he's done
2010-10-14T14:57:30  <Zannick> where small amount could be 0

2010-10-14T14:58:01  <Zannick> problem with that is it can get you very slightly behind early
2010-10-14T14:58:07  <Zannick> everything has tradeoffs
2010-10-14T14:58:45  <lavalamp> Yeah and now I am thinking that it might take a lot of games between two bots to decide who makes those kind of decisions better
2010-10-14T15:01:13  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3697), Hazard(3690), felixcoto(3681), rsergio(3670), MariusCG(3658), deepblue(3606), savchenko(3599), davidjliu(3592), ruilov(3571), cfaftw(3562)
2010-10-14T15:02:19  <jmcarthur> my best guess as to why the elo scores all dropped like that is that some bots may perform much better on the web server than the cloud servers or vice versa
2010-10-14T15:02:37  <jmcarthur> and since the cloud servers are going up and down we are seeing some effects, perhaps?
2010-10-14T15:03:23  <jmcarthur> would be nice if we could see an average turn length for all the bots :)
2010-10-14T15:03:41  <jmcarthur> *for each bot
2010-10-14T15:04:19  <rebelxt> does anyone know what exactly has been happening to the cloud servers? is this something we could help organizers to resolve?
2010-10-14T15:04:37  <jmcarthur> no idea
2010-10-14T15:04:43  <Zannick> sweet, we have a top100 entry in C
2010-10-14T15:04:50  <jmcarthur> the organizers have been very quiet lately
2010-10-14T15:05:04  <Zannick> the organizers have been very quiet throughout
2010-10-14T15:05:11  <jmcarthur> yeah, but especially lately
2010-10-14T15:05:15  <lavalamp> I'm still waiting for them to enable golang :(
2010-10-14T15:05:23  <Zannick> danielvf was the most active admin, and he went on vacation (?)
2010-10-14T15:05:29  <jmcarthur> they had their sleeves rolled up quite a bit for the first couple weeks
2010-10-14T15:05:34  <jmcarthur> yeah, daniel rocks
2010-10-14T15:06:01  <Zannick> jeff has not been very active
2010-10-14T15:06:05  <jmcarthur> at all

2010-10-14T15:06:31  <jmcarthur> hehe
2010-10-14T15:06:31  <Zannick> so the cloud servers were daniel's doing
2010-10-14T15:06:32  <rebelxt> with daniel out of reach, who is the go to guy on server issues?
2010-10-14T15:06:40  <jmcarthur> jeff, but good luck
2010-10-14T15:06:54  <jmcarthur> whatever happened to dstufft?
2010-10-14T15:06:55  <lavalamp> does jeff actually exist?
2010-10-14T15:06:59  <Zannick> you could probably ask amstan some things about the main server

2010-10-14T15:16:40  <rebelxt> it appears cloud servers require some manual work to get configured/started, and something causes servers become non-functional within hours every time they are brought up (crashes, memory leaks, etc?), so maybe we can help with some automation to get this resolved

2010-10-14T15:22:20  <Zannick> lavalamp: mostly
2010-10-14T15:22:21  <cfaftw> :o
2010-10-14T15:22:36  <Zannick> it adds a little
2010-10-14T15:22:44  <lavalamp> hm
2010-10-14T15:23:32  <lavalamp> It seems like being a turn behind will matter eventually
2010-10-14T15:24:01  <lavalamp> actually, on second thought, that means the first player really has to work a tiny advantage

2010-10-14T15:25:32  <Zannick> it is, however, open source, so you can run it :)

2010-10-14T15:27:30  <Zannick> sure. good luck.
2010-10-14T15:27:35  <rebelxt> ;-)
2010-10-14T15:27:49  <Zannick> it's a very complicated, slightly documented strategy that works against starter bots
2010-10-14T15:28:07  <Zannick> i guess i've ruined the competition for everyone submitting starter bots :P
2010-10-14T15:28:16  <JamesMG> not doing anything also works against starter bots half the time
2010-10-14T15:28:22  <cfaftw> lol
2010-10-14T15:28:31  <JamesMG> gonna submit that bot
2010-10-14T15:28:43  <cfaftw> LazyBot
2010-10-14T15:28:47  <Zannick> you know copybot is guaranteed to draw against itself :)
2010-10-14T15:29:13  <lavalamp> A more interesting case would be to mirror until you think they make a mistake, then start running your real code
2010-10-14T15:29:23  <Zannick> copybot should be a starter bot
2010-10-14T15:29:40  <Zannick> or at least the version that doesn't add ships to fleets
2010-10-14T15:29:42  <lavalamp> If their mistake is large enough, them being a turn ahead shouldn't matter
2010-10-14T15:33:26  <Zannick> this is why sometimes passing on turn 1 can be useful

2010-10-14T15:51:52  <lavalamp> I took that to mean it averaged 6.4 games per minute over the last hour

2010-10-14T16:49:52  <Migi32> Bobng, how would you do that? Donate money? Or run the server app locally? The latter isn't possible I'm afraid as there's no way to make 100% sure you're not skewing the results
2010-10-14T16:50:35  <Bobng> I am going to buy a rather expensive and rather large server with the aim to setting up a small company selling VPS's, with a few friends.
2010-10-14T16:50:40  <Zannick> you would be ineligible to participate if you have access to any server playing games
2010-10-14T16:50:54  <Bobng> At the start we are going to have a lot of resources left - 4 CPU's and too much ram to think about all idle.
2010-10-14T16:51:20  <Migi32> Bobng, I have 4 CPU's and a ton of ram on my home desktop
2010-10-14T16:51:22  <Bobng> I would be willing to donate a portion of the spare resources (A generous portion) in return for some small publicities
2010-10-14T16:51:47  <Bobng> Migi32: 4 cores != 4 cpu's
2010-10-14T16:51:56  <Migi32> oh. ok then :P
2010-10-14T16:52:04  <Bobng> and a ton of RAM != 32gb
2010-10-14T16:52:23  <Migi32> nope you're wrong about that. 32 gb is a ton of RAM :P
2010-10-14T16:52:52  <Migi32> but I get your point, I don't have 32. I have 6GB
2010-10-14T16:54:28  <Bobng> Thats a fair bit for a home PC. Anyway yeah, I would be donating a large VPS
2010-10-14T16:54:35  <Bobng> depending on what resources the game engine takes
2010-10-14T16:54:44  <Bobng> anything up to 4gb and a few cores
2010-10-14T16:56:19  <rebelxt> contestbot: summon j3camero
2010-10-14T16:56:20  <contestbot> rebelxt: No!
2010-10-14T16:56:28  <rebelxt> ..
2010-10-14T16:58:00  <Migi32> Bobng, one game engine can only be 3 threads, one of which needs negligible cpu power, so I guess you'd only have to give 2 cores per engine
2010-10-14T16:58:41  <Migi32> and there was an upper limit on memory usage per bot as well, but I don't know that off the top of my head
2010-10-14T16:59:00  <Bobng> Well I need to ask what resources the amazon VPS's are
2010-10-14T16:59:08  <Bobng> and probably mirror those.
2010-10-14T16:59:25  <Bobng> as for the CPU power I will give a few cores, it doesn't need one per thread.
2010-10-14T17:00:01  <rebelxt> Bobng: i'm using a small instance for private TCP server. 1.7GB of RAM, 1 core
2010-10-14T17:00:03  <rebelxt> http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
2010-10-14T17:00:26  <rebelxt> it's actually running 2-3 games per minute with just a single core and mutliple games going concurrently
2010-10-14T17:00:45  <Bobng> thats quite good
2010-10-14T17:01:15  <contestbot> Top 10 players: Hazard(3670), felixcoto(3649), dmj111(3643), rsergio(3611), MariusCG(3608), deepblue(3599), savchenko(3569), cfaftw(3569), davidjliu(3568), _iouri_(3557)
2010-10-14T17:01:53  <Zannick> right, but a tcp server only uses its cpu power for the engine, the bots are separate

2010-10-14T17:02:30  <rebelxt> contest organizers are probably using high CPU instances (such as one with 8 cores) since their cloud servers average 20 games per minute, but i'm not sure

2010-10-14T17:02:54  <Bobng> 20 games per min is not high at all
2010-10-14T17:03:24  <rebelxt> Bobng: well, interpreted languages slow things down a lot
2010-10-14T17:03:35  <Zannick> compared to the main server's 6-8/min.
2010-10-14T17:03:36  <Bobng> I wonder what the load is on those amazon servers
2010-10-14T17:04:13  <rebelxt> Bobng: their amazon servers are all down :( there have been issues with them recently
2010-10-14T17:04:36  <Bobng> yeah I saw. But I can hardly imagine that the CPU was maxed out running 20 games a min.
2010-10-14T17:05:37  <Zannick> it might just have been a setting to run so many daemons at once

2010-10-14T17:14:35  <Migi32> wow. I just found out that as the number of possible moves increases, the advantage player 2 gets by knowing p1's move (if they have to make it at the same time) increases insanely fast
2010-10-14T17:14:37  <rebelxt> ah lol i did not notice
2010-10-14T17:15:07  <Migi32> for Tron, the number of possible moves was <= 4, but for this game it's so big that minimax is just fundamentally flawed

2010-10-14T17:15:53  <Zannick> you have to narrow the space so much it isn't very worth it
2010-10-14T17:17:05  <Migi32> these calculations were done on a minimax-tree 2 levels deep with the value of the leaf nodes being random, so that might be slightly skewed. But still
2010-10-14T17:18:03  <Zannick> i still like to quote the number of possible moves on the first turn of any starter map
2010-10-14T17:18:26  <rebelxt> Migi32: dunno if you saw this - i experimented with predicting enemies current turn by using my own bot's strategy. then use enemies predicted actions to optimize my current turn. this is not working well at this point, but i'm not giving up on this approach just yet
2010-10-14T17:18:32  <Zannick> 9.414x10^23
2010-10-14T17:18:43  <antimatroid> i still think approximate minimax trees done right are going to rein supreme
2010-10-14T17:18:50  <Zannick> it's over 9000...times 10^20

2010-10-14T17:20:47  <antimatroid> the idea of this minimax approximation is to just test out a large combination of plausible good moves
2010-10-14T17:20:51  <Migi32> each node was a random value between 0 and 1. The best player 1 could do when both players had 10 choices was 25 on average. For 50 choices it was 10. For 200 it is 2.
2010-10-14T17:20:59  <antimatroid> and then sort of pick which one seems to work best

2010-10-14T18:46:03  <MarcAndrePC> the rating of the top player drop a lot
2010-10-14T18:46:31  <bhasker> good to see that
2010-10-14T18:46:51  <bhasker> i was getting depressed that the gap between top and my bot was growing at such an incredible rate^
2010-10-14T18:47:01  <bhasker> now i am only 400 elo points away compared 600 yesterday!
2010-10-14T18:48:49  <MarcAndrePC> yea it's better

2010-10-14T18:52:18  <Naktibalda> like +30 positions in a list
2010-10-14T18:52:39  <bhasker> not sure, but my bot did climb rankings today
2010-10-14T18:52:41  <bhasker> not sure what happened
2010-10-14T18:52:52  <bhasker> though my elo rating seems to have dropped too
2010-10-14T18:53:04  <bhasker> now that i look at it, the gap between my bot and top bot is still the same :(
2010-10-14T18:53:10  <bhasker> 600 points odd :-\

2010-10-14T18:53:50  <amstan> where's that bot with 4000 elo?
2010-10-14T18:54:00  <MarcAndrePC> was rsergio
2010-10-14T18:54:21  <amstan> where did he go?
2010-10-14T18:54:21  <MarcAndrePC> he top at 4101 yesterday
2010-10-14T18:54:30  <MarcAndrePC> he is 4th now
2010-10-14T18:54:30  <amstan> so.. what happened?
2010-10-14T18:54:48  <MarcAndrePC> dont know what happen all the rating drop and him too...
2010-10-14T18:54:57  <Zannick> maybe bayeselo decided it was overestimating everyone...
2010-10-14T18:56:03  <amstan> maybe we took out the starter bots
2010-10-14T18:56:21  <dmj111> I think when people resubmit, their histories are dropped from the calculations, so _all_ of the ratings change.

2010-10-14T18:57:22  <Zannick> yes
2010-10-14T18:57:31  <Zannick> did many people resubmit worse bots?
2010-10-14T18:59:22  <dmj111> Since there have not been many games, all of the uncertainties are high on bots submitted the last few days, I imagine.
2010-10-14T19:00:56  <jmcarthur> amstan: i suspect that it may have something to do with the cloud servers going up and down, personally. maybe some bots do better on the cloud servers than the web server or vice versa

2010-10-14T19:22:39  <sigh> also, the compiler script doesn't link any .so files, so avoid any of the parts of boost that require them
