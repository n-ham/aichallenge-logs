2012-04-14T09:14:36  <mcstar> there are plenty
2012-04-14T09:14:53  <mcstar> there is a problem with unboxing

2012-04-14T09:15:11  <mcstar> t
2012-04-14T09:16:25  <thestinger> oh, judy arrays are basically tries

2012-04-14T11:57:58  <smiley1983> lorill: I added your ocaml starter, but changed the int_of_int32_string because it crashed on my system: http://bit.ly/HLkQZL
2012-04-14T11:58:21  <smiley1983> if you can suggest a neater implementation, I will be happy to update it
2012-04-14T11:59:19  <mcstar> smiley1983: how does a bot communicate with the simulation runtime?
2012-04-14T11:59:54  <smiley1983> stdin/stdout if I've understood your question correctly
2012-04-14T12:00:27  <mcstar> do you just provide time-slices?
2012-04-14T12:00:36  <lorill> smiley: ok, thanks. I've had overflows with simply int_of_string, as int is only 31bit on a 32 bit system, and the seed was too big. But the int32 should suffice
2012-04-14T12:00:42  <lorill> what error did you have ?
2012-04-14T12:01:26  <mcstar> smiley1983: i mean the running of the simulation basicallly turn based? like in ants? time is continuous in this case, as well as space
2012-04-14T12:01:31  <mcstar> i dont know how you solved this
2012-04-14T12:03:42  <lorill> it's turn based too
2012-04-14T12:03:46  <smiley1983> mcstar: yes, turn based, but the engine simulates many steps for each turn presented to the player
2012-04-14T12:04:42  <smiley1983> lorill: crashed with Failure "int_of_string" which I found a bit confusing
2012-04-14T12:04:53  <smiley1983> it was definitely from the player_seed input though
2012-04-14T12:05:14  <smiley1983> is your system 32bit? It was crashing on 64bit here.
2012-04-14T12:06:08  <mcstar> what is the ration between the simulation timestep and the turntime?
2012-04-14T12:06:24  <mcstar> rather, the inverse
2012-04-14T12:06:27  <smiley1983> currently turn_steps is set to 10
2012-04-14T12:06:33  <smiley1983> so you get 10 steps for every player turn
2012-04-14T12:06:50  <mcstar> i guess the bot knows this
2012-04-14T12:07:15  <smiley1983> yes, I believe the bot now gets all the setup info it needs
2012-04-14T12:07:29  <mcstar> so a bot can give out speed commmands?
2012-04-14T12:07:35  <smiley1983> If you find anything it should be told but isn't, I'll be happy to know
2012-04-14T12:07:49  <mcstar> i havent had the chance to look at it actually
2012-04-14T12:08:03  <smiley1983> speed commands? thrust is a float, but I'm not sure if that's what you meant
2012-04-14T12:08:22  <mcstar> ok
2012-04-14T12:08:24  <mcstar> i get it
2012-04-14T12:08:56  <smiley1983> orders consist of (target, thrust, turn, fire) tuples
2012-04-14T12:09:08  <smiley1983> with target being the ID of the ship you are ordering
2012-04-14T12:09:26  <mcstar> can a bot have more than 1 ships?
2012-04-14T12:09:37  <smiley1983> yes, in the multi-ship fork :)
2012-04-14T12:10:00  <mcstar> how sdo you calculate collisions?
2012-04-14T12:10:19  <smiley1983> multi-ship: http://50.116.32.118:2086/replay.2011
2012-04-14T12:10:51  <smiley1983> all objects are circular, simple distance calculation (now with edge-wrapping taken into account)
2012-04-14T12:11:22  <mcstar> so you just check in every step
2012-04-14T12:11:30  <mcstar> i guess thats ok
2012-04-14T12:11:56  <mcstar> do you think this will be the next challenge?
2012-04-14T12:12:03  <smiley1983> euler integration, so not very accurate for real-world physics, but okay for the engine
2012-04-14T12:12:15  <smiley1983> I don't have any opinion :)
2012-04-14T12:12:51  <smiley1983> I made a risk prototype as well, so people can test that: http://50.116.32.118:2084/replay.627
2012-04-14T12:13:05  <smiley1983> I would find both interesting to program for
2012-04-14T12:13:25  <smiley1983> when I say "as well", I should clarify that aerique wrote the asteroids prototype
2012-04-14T12:13:28  <mcstar> hm, that one is too static
2012-04-14T12:13:47  <mcstar> and looks a bit like pw
2012-04-14T12:13:50  <smiley1983> the visualizer is only showing a fraction of the activity
2012-04-14T12:14:06  <smiley1983> indeed, it has some pw-like qualities, but is less exciting to watch
2012-04-14T12:14:21  <smiley1983> the only problem with asteroids in its current form is that the entry bar is quite high
2012-04-14T12:14:22  <mcstar> i vote for asteroids
2012-04-14T12:14:30  <mcstar> oh?
2012-04-14T12:14:54  <smiley1983> most simple changes to movement will result in dying much faster than if you just sat still
2012-04-14T12:14:57  <mcstar> you have to be of legal age to drink in a bar
2012-04-14T12:14:59  <mcstar> so i dont mind
2012-04-14T12:15:35  <smiley1983> there is no simple way to fly around without dying
2012-04-14T12:15:40  <mcstar> smiley1983: early ant ai's werent very sophisticated
2012-04-14T12:15:51  <mcstar> but still, you could make a worse bot than them
2012-04-14T12:17:04  <smiley1983> I do like the asteroids idea, but I think it will be necessary to write good simulation tutorials to get people to make sensible bots
2012-04-14T12:17:30  <mcstar> what is the purpose? to reach 20k contestants?
2012-04-14T12:17:54  <mcstar> i think the challenge is a bit infamous now, cant you put the bar higher?
2012-04-14T12:18:30  <smiley1983> that's true; the point is to get more good entries, not just more overall
2012-04-14T12:18:40  <smiley1983> so maybe a higher entry bar is a good thing at this point
2012-04-14T12:19:25  <mcstar> did you write the framework in ocaml?
2012-04-14T12:19:32  <mcstar> (the replay is html i guess)
2012-04-14T12:19:37  <mcstar> html5
2012-04-14T12:19:49  <smiley1983> the engine is python, I only wrote the starter package in ocaml
2012-04-14T12:19:58  <mcstar> oh
2012-04-14T12:20:01  <antimatroid> i think we'll find a fairly large reduction in users once we work out how to cull "starter level quality bots"
2012-04-14T12:20:21  <mcstar> it is easy
2012-04-14T12:20:42  <mcstar> there is a qualification round, when you new entry must consistently beat starter packages
