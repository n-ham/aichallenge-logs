2011-05-02T05:37:55  <mcstar> how many times do you have to correct /join aichallenge before u join the right channel?
2011-05-02T05:38:19  <mcstar> interestingly enough, theres was a guy on #ai-challenge
2011-05-02T05:42:17  <antimatroid> mcstar: i used to have that problem
2011-05-02T05:42:25  <antimatroid> i used to try aicontest too
2011-05-02T05:42:31  <antimatroid> but now pidgin just has it
2011-05-02T05:42:36  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-02T05:42:41  <antimatroid> pidgin <3
2011-05-02T05:42:45  <mcstar> i added to bookmarks too
2011-05-02T05:42:50  <mcstar> but its easier to type
2011-05-02T05:43:01  <mcstar> i hate the rodent
2011-05-02T05:43:07  <antimatroid> i'm wrestling with symmetry of games still :P
2011-05-02T05:43:12  <mcstar> ah
2011-05-02T05:43:40  <mcstar> im writing a split-string function
2011-05-02T05:43:56  <mcstar> the original is still faster
2011-05-02T05:44:13  <antimatroid> why would you split strings?
2011-05-02T05:44:43  <antimatroid> if it's for the contest, the input has been made so you shouldn't need to do that
2011-05-02T05:44:46  <antimatroid> i made sure of it :P
2011-05-02T05:45:02  <antimatroid> i hate having to break strings up, it's lame, although i usually just use a stringstream
2011-05-02T05:45:28  <antimatroid> that doesn't really help i guess :P
2011-05-02T05:45:38  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-02T05:45:55  <mcstar> yeah, its too general, i could exactly anticipate the input
2011-05-02T05:46:54  <mcstar> in fact i may make another function which peeks into the stream
2011-05-02T05:47:23  <mcstar> and then peeks again until the command is uniqe
2011-05-02T05:47:32  <mcstar> and then peeks again up to a space
2011-05-02T05:47:35  <mcstar> then reads the value
2011-05-02T05:47:52  <mcstar> but i could use a nice splitstring function in future
2011-05-02T05:48:27  <mcstar> we have a nice function in cl, peek-char
2011-05-02T05:48:51  <mcstar> reads a char from the strem, but at the same time, doesnt advance the stream-pointer so to speak

2011-05-02T09:32:19  <smiley1983> I didn't for the last contest because I wasn't familiar with git (or anything else) yet. I am using git for this one. (the question wasn't directed at me, though)
2011-05-02T09:34:00  <mcstar> never mind
2011-05-02T09:34:10  <mcstar> it was an open question really
2011-05-02T09:34:24  <mcstar> no i dont use version control
2011-05-02T09:34:46  <mcstar> so you say you can benefit from it
2011-05-02T09:35:09  <mcstar> im also not familiar with any of it
2011-05-02T09:35:22  <mcstar> i can clone a repository but thats all :)
2011-05-02T09:35:48  <mcstar> so
2011-05-02T09:35:50  <sigh> at it's most basic use, it lets you keep a complete history of your work
2011-05-02T09:35:57  <mcstar> yeah
2011-05-02T09:36:02  <mcstar> thats why im contemplating
2011-05-02T09:36:10  <sigh> so you don't need to worry about breaking anything, or losing anything... you can always revert back to something that worked
2011-05-02T09:36:11  <mcstar> and is it run on ur computer?
2011-05-02T09:36:28  <sigh> yes
2011-05-02T09:36:50  <mcstar> i dont understand how it works
2011-05-02T09:37:01  <mcstar> is there a daemon which checks file changes?
2011-05-02T09:37:04  <sigh> version control systems generally keep metadata in a special directory which stores everything about the repo
2011-05-02T09:37:09  <sigh> no, you tell it
2011-05-02T09:37:13  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-02T09:37:18  <mcstar> so i say REFRESH
2011-05-02T09:37:25  <sigh> like you with normal files, you click save to save it
2011-05-02T09:37:40  <sigh> in a version control system you "commit" to save the state
2011-05-02T09:37:44  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-02T09:38:03  <mcstar> whats ur choice?
2011-05-02T09:38:15  <mcstar> i guess git
2011-05-02T09:38:46  <sigh> git is fine
2011-05-02T09:39:23  <mcstar> ill look for a wiki
2011-05-02T09:39:39  <sigh> there should be plenty of tutorials on git on the net
2011-05-02T09:40:24  <sigh> to start off with you only really need to know three commands: init (to create the repo), add (to add things to the repo), and commit (to actually save changes)
2011-05-02T09:41:02  <mcstar> yeah but im sure i have to set up some config file
2011-05-02T09:41:27  <sigh> nah, you don't
2011-05-02T09:41:40  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-02T09:41:49  <mcstar> how does it know where are my files?
2011-05-02T09:41:52  <mcstar> lol
2011-05-02T09:42:03  <mcstar> it backs up my whole system :)
2011-05-02T09:42:15  <sigh> you go to a directory and you type: `git init` and then it turns that directory into a git repo
2011-05-02T09:42:30  <mcstar> whoa
2011-05-02T09:42:34  <mcstar> sounds easy
2011-05-02T09:42:38  <sigh> yeah
2011-05-02T09:42:54  <sigh> it will create a hidden directory inside called .git which stores everything about it
2011-05-02T09:43:06  <mcstar> im gonna try it
2011-05-02T09:43:17  <sigh> if you look a repo you have cloned, you will see a .git directory at the top level
2011-05-02T09:43:47  <mcstar> shat im stupid
2011-05-02T09:43:55  <mcstar> its already installed of course
2011-05-02T09:44:00  <sigh> :)
2011-05-02T09:45:21  <mcstar> do i have to git add every file i want it to track?
2011-05-02T09:46:10  <sigh> you can entire directories, like if you want to add everything in the current directory and below just go: `git add .`
2011-05-02T09:47:27  <mcstar> no, ill add only a couple
2011-05-02T09:47:41  <mcstar> thx
2011-05-02T09:47:47  <mcstar> its seems its working
2011-05-02T09:47:59  <mcstar> i see there are gui frontend to it
2011-05-02T09:47:59  <sigh> have you commited yet?
2011-05-02T09:48:09  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-02T09:48:11  <sigh> yeah... I haven't used it much though
2011-05-02T09:48:28  <mcstar> shat
2011-05-02T09:48:42  <mcstar> nice colorful file
2011-05-02T09:48:49  <mcstar> it opened it up after commit
2011-05-02T09:48:59  <mcstar> wait a minute
2011-05-02T09:49:09  <sigh> ahh... that's where you type your commit message
2011-05-02T09:49:19  <mcstar> yeah it says it empty
2011-05-02T09:49:25  <mcstar> so i have to fill in a filed
2011-05-02T09:49:27  <mcstar> field
2011-05-02T09:49:45  <sigh> quit and about for now
2011-05-02T09:49:48  <mcstar> or i have to save the file?
2011-05-02T09:49:59  <sigh> just do: git commit -m "My first commit"
2011-05-02T09:50:03  <sigh> or whatever
2011-05-02T09:50:22  <sigh> but yes, if you are comfortable with the editor, then you just type you message at the top and commit
2011-05-02T09:50:25  <sigh> *and save
2011-05-02T09:50:48  <sigh> btw, what os are you on?
2011-05-02T09:51:11  <mcstar> im on win2000
2011-05-02T09:51:32  <mcstar> sorry, i need to laugh
2011-05-02T09:51:42  <sigh> :)
2011-05-02T09:51:44  <mcstar> latest linux of course
2011-05-02T09:52:40  <sigh> I'm assuming that git opened up vim for you... if you don't like/don't know how to use vim, you can set your prefered editor in the $EDITOR env variable
2011-05-02T09:52:57  <mcstar> its already set to vim i cant live wo it
2011-05-02T09:53:02  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-02T09:53:08  <sigh> :)
2011-05-02T09:53:40  <sigh> so have you completed the first commit yet?
2011-05-02T09:54:49  <mcstar> i see, git doesnt responf to touch
2011-05-02T09:54:49  <mcstar> d
2011-05-02T09:54:49  <mcstar> yes i had my first commit
2011-05-02T09:54:49  <sigh> what do you mean it doesn't respond to touch?
2011-05-02T09:54:49  <mcstar> like make
2011-05-02T09:54:49  <sigh> ahh, yeah
2011-05-02T09:54:49  <sigh> it only cares if the file is different
2011-05-02T09:55:02  <mcstar> uses filesize, or quickly hashes it?
2011-05-02T09:55:24  <Naktibalda> git hashes everything
2011-05-02T09:55:37  <sigh> git is designed to be very very fast, I assume it uses a few heuristics
2011-05-02T09:56:27  <mcstar> i beleive it still cannot hash Chuck Norris

2011-05-02T09:59:20  <sigh> it's always quite fast :)
2011-05-02T10:00:07  <mcstar> yep ist a simple diff output

2011-05-02T10:05:58  <sigh> that should be enough to get you started for now, but I do recommend glancing at a tutorial
2011-05-02T10:10:14  <mcstar> yeah, thanks
2011-05-02T10:10:34  <mcstar> i will definitely look at the turotial when i need to retrieve a prev.version :D

2011-05-02T10:42:58  <mcstar> hey guys, will you implement some kind of timeout mechanism?
2011-05-02T10:43:35  <mcstar> for example if youre bot thinks for too long then you return, and make a faster decision?

2011-05-02T12:59:01  <jbroman> mcstar: Even if none is provided, you can ask the kernel to return to you after some time interval.
2011-05-02T12:59:22  <jbroman> If you put it a fair time ahead of the time the judge uses, you'll probably get it in in time.
2011-05-02T12:59:36  <jbroman> (e.g. ask for an interrupt after 850 ms if the timeout is 1000 ms)
2011-05-02T13:00:30  <mcstar> oh, i meant in your ur own bot
2011-05-02T13:00:36  <mcstar> -ur
2011-05-02T13:00:38  <mcstar> e
2011-05-02T13:00:41  <mcstar> sry
2011-05-02T13:00:58  <mcstar> so i didnt mean that the bot-running system should implement it
2011-05-02T13:01:29  <jbroman> (I didn't read backlog, so forgive me if I'm being dense.)
2011-05-02T13:01:52  <mcstar> theres no backlog for that, i mean it was 2 lines :)
2011-05-02T13:02:04  <mcstar> i wont use C
2011-05-02T13:02:09  <mcstar> but im curious
2011-05-02T13:02:16  <mcstar> how would u implement it in it?
2011-05-02T13:02:31  <jbroman> setitimer
2011-05-02T13:02:35  <mcstar> oh
2011-05-02T13:02:37  <jbroman> (bindings for other language exist as well)
2011-05-02T13:02:49  <mcstar> so its standard
2011-05-02T13:02:55  <jbroman> On Linux it is. :P
2011-05-02T13:02:55  <mcstar> ive never seen it
2011-05-02T13:03:03  <jbroman> Not sure about various other OSes.
2011-05-02T13:03:13  <jbroman> But I'm pretty sure you can get at it in at least Python and probably other languages as well.
2011-05-02T13:03:14  <mcstar> i dont care about other oses :)
2011-05-02T13:03:35  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.9.82> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-02T13:03:50  <mcstar> so what im really interested in
2011-05-02T13:04:02  <mcstar> is that is it common to use such a feature?
2011-05-02T13:04:12  <mcstar> bot-wise
2011-05-02T13:04:23  <jbroman> Hypothesis: no. Evidence: I have none.
2011-05-02T13:04:30  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-02T13:04:42  <mcstar> ur an organizer right?
2011-05-02T13:04:47  <mcstar> and wont partizipate?
2011-05-02T13:05:09  <jbroman> I probably won't participate, though I'm not entirely sure whether I count as an organizer at this point.
2011-05-02T13:05:17  <a1k0n> in the tron contest, it was commonplace
2011-05-02T13:05:23  <a1k0n> (setitimer)
2011-05-02T13:05:33  <jbroman> OK, there you go.
2011-05-02T13:05:38  <mcstar> how much time was there to think?
2011-05-02T13:05:45  <a1k0n> it was the only reliable way to ensure you took <1s, actually, since the servers were so... well, let's just say there was a lot of variance in CPU cycles you got
2011-05-02T13:05:49  <a1k0n> 1 second
2011-05-02T13:06:04  <mcstar> i see
2011-05-02T13:06:09  <a1k0n> i anticipate ants being much the same
2011-05-02T13:06:22  <mcstar> so u would definitely implement it?
2011-05-02T13:06:26  <a1k0n> mcstar: are you using common lisp?  sorry, only partly listening in here
2011-05-02T13:06:33  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-02T13:06:44  <mcstar> i found a package
2011-05-02T13:06:48  <mcstar> which does this
2011-05-02T13:06:48  <a1k0n> i'm certain in sbcl there's a way to invoke a setitimer and capture the alarm signal
2011-05-02T13:07:02  <mcstar> yes, i can manage
2011-05-02T13:07:05  <mcstar> i think
2011-05-02T13:07:26  <mcstar> and do u participate now?
2011-05-02T13:07:33  <mcstar> i beleive u won the tron contest
2011-05-02T13:07:39  <mcstar> right?
2011-05-02T13:07:45  <a1k0n> i did.  i participated in planetwars but kinda sucked at it
2011-05-02T13:08:10  <a1k0n> i had all sorts of really great ideas that turned out to be useless, and eventually gave up
2011-05-02T13:08:24  <mcstar> ur name rhymes with Lord Nikon
2011-05-02T13:08:40  <a1k0n> it does.
2011-05-02T13:08:57  <a1k0n> i should have come up with a less crappy one.
2011-05-02T13:09:04  <a1k0n> but hey, the domain was open
2011-05-02T13:09:21  <mcstar> so how about now?
2011-05-02T13:09:31  <mcstar> are u coding?
2011-05-02T13:09:48  <a1k0n> you mean, am i planning to enter the ants contest?
2011-05-02T13:09:53  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-02T13:09:59  <a1k0n> i most likely will but don't know how much time i can devote to it
2011-05-02T13:10:23  <mcstar> well, have time and good luck
2011-05-02T13:10:28  <a1k0n> heh, thanks
2011-05-02T13:11:00  <a1k0n> hey, didn't bocsimacko use sbcl, with a setitimer equivalent for planetwars?
2011-05-02T13:11:32  <mcstar> im not sure
2011-05-02T13:11:36  <mcstar> i glanced over the code
2011-05-02T13:11:44  <mcstar> but didnt find such

2011-05-02T13:15:51  <bhasker> folks*
2011-05-02T13:15:56  <a1k0n> morning bhasker
2011-05-02T13:16:03  <bhasker> how goes it
2011-05-02T13:16:15  <a1k0n> good.  i probably slept more than you last night but most likely not much
2011-05-02T13:16:35  <bhasker> hehe actually our daughter is getting settled in, she woke us up only twice yesterday night
2011-05-02T13:16:43  <bhasker> and slept for 3+ hrs after feeding
2011-05-02T13:16:51  <bhasker> so we got some good sleep
2011-05-02T13:16:54  <a1k0n> yeah, i guess that's the best you can hope for
2011-05-02T13:16:59  <bhasker> yup
2011-05-02T13:17:06  <a1k0n> most people don't consider 3 hours of sleep much, but yeah you get used to it.
2011-05-02T13:17:22  <bhasker> i think as long as totally i get 6-7 hrs of sleep i am fine
2011-05-02T13:17:51  <bhasker> how are things at work
2011-05-02T13:19:22  <a1k0n> oh, deliverywise ok.  a news-making farm breakage last week.
2011-05-02T13:20:08  <bhasker> yea saw it on the news and twitter
2011-05-02T13:20:15  <bhasker> i was just glad that it wasn't delivery:)
2011-05-02T13:20:43  <bhasker> though it still blows that we had that big an outage
2011-05-02T13:20:51  <bhasker> to make it to news
2011-05-02T13:25:07  <mcstar> lol
2011-05-02T13:25:33  <mcstar> nice code to hide your email address in ascii art

2011-05-02T13:29:25  <bhasker> that is exactly why i hate perl
2011-05-02T13:29:33  <mcstar> hehe
2011-05-02T13:29:38  <mcstar> i dont know perl
2011-05-02T13:29:43  <a1k0n> you're afraid to run that, because it downloads and executes a rootkit
2011-05-02T13:30:13  <mcstar> im afraid to parse it
2011-05-02T13:30:21  <a1k0n> only perl can parse perl
2011-05-02T13:30:30  <mcstar> human can paerse perl too
2011-05-02T13:30:30  <bhasker> yup
2011-05-02T13:30:42  <mcstar> i guess
2011-05-02T13:30:44  <a1k0n> bhasker: you saw this, right?  http://a1k0n.net/code/donutmk2.c.txt
2011-05-02T13:32:08  <mcstar> my mind is officially blown

2011-05-02T13:33:02  <mcstar> haha
2011-05-02T13:33:07  <mcstar> man, its very nice
2011-05-02T13:33:14  <a1k0n> heheh thanks
2011-05-02T13:33:15  <mcstar> i will show to my friends
2011-05-02T13:34:05  <bhasker> what the hell does that code do?
2011-05-02T13:34:17  <a1k0n> it does what it says
2011-05-02T13:34:47  <bhasker> hmm not sure i see a pattern in the ascii art
2011-05-02T13:35:06  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-02T13:35:10  <mcstar> did u compile it?
2011-05-02T13:35:14  <mcstar> anyways
2011-05-02T13:35:18  <bhasker> not yet
2011-05-02T13:35:21  <bhasker> not running anything like this
2011-05-02T13:35:23  <mcstar> it looks better in a real terminal
2011-05-02T13:35:25  <bhasker> :D
2011-05-02T13:35:26  <mcstar> the timing is better
2011-05-02T13:35:27  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-05-02T13:35:31  <bhasker> let me see later
2011-05-02T13:35:33  <bhasker> brb
2011-05-02T13:35:36  <mcstar> and the black background helps
2011-05-02T13:35:41  <a1k0n> you can stick a usleep in there on the lower-right
2011-05-02T13:35:47  <a1k0n> where all those ;;;;;s are
2011-05-02T13:35:59  <a1k0n> wasn't ANSI C so i didn't put it in
2011-05-02T13:38:02  <mcstar> if you are as good in game logic as in code-golf i dont stand a chance

2011-05-02T13:56:07  <bhasker> or it made a mistake and the engine dumped it
2011-05-02T13:56:10  <bhasker> i think there are still some bugs
2011-05-02T13:56:49  <mcstar> i hope there are
2011-05-02T13:56:54  <bhasker> lol why?
2011-05-02T13:56:54  <mcstar> ants must eat bugs
2011-05-02T13:57:15  <mcstar> i see a problem with the visualizer
2011-05-02T13:57:21  <bhasker> which is
2011-05-02T13:57:24  <mcstar> water is dark
2011-05-02T13:57:26  <mcstar> too dark
2011-05-02T13:57:33  <mcstar> i cant see the ants because of it

2011-05-02T16:33:13  <bhasker> yup
2011-05-02T16:33:46  <mcstar> i dump what the engine says to the bot
2011-05-02T16:33:52  <mcstar> and i dont see the end keyword
2011-05-02T16:33:56  <mcstar> in the specifications
2011-05-02T16:33:59  <mcstar> on the wiki
2011-05-02T16:34:05  <mcstar> it supposed to be tehre
2011-05-02T16:34:36  <mcstar> like this for example:
2011-05-02T16:34:40  <mcstar> end
2011-05-02T16:34:41  <mcstar> players 2
2011-05-02T16:34:42  <mcstar> score 1 0
2011-05-02T16:34:44  <mcstar> go
2011-05-02T16:34:51  <mcstar> this is the end input from the engine

2011-05-02T16:37:08  <bhasker> just check the python code

2011-05-02T16:37:23  <bhasker> to see what it does
2011-05-02T16:38:00  <mcstar> i rewrote ants.py to dump raw_input() to stderr
2011-05-02T16:38:14  <mcstar> and it seems the server doesnt send end

2011-05-02T16:41:30  <mcstar> so can youre bot handle "end"?
2011-05-02T16:42:10  <mcstar> or you use "turns" for an exit condition?
2011-05-02T16:42:19  <bhasker> not sure i just used the c++ starter bot that antimatroid wrote up
2011-05-02T16:42:23  <bhasker> i haven't bothered rewriting that part
2011-05-02T16:42:30  <mcstar> ah
2011-05-02T16:42:33  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-02T16:42:41  <bhasker> i am going to rewrite that part later
2011-05-02T16:42:54  <mcstar> then i suppose the specs are a bit ahead of the worker
2011-05-02T16:43:16  <bhasker> might be

2011-05-02T17:35:49  <mcstar> can any of u answer my questions?
2011-05-02T17:36:02  <janzert> don't know :)
2011-05-02T17:36:10  <mcstar> i looked at engine.py
2011-05-02T17:36:29  <mcstar> and it really assembles the string which is suposed to be sent
2011-05-02T17:36:33  <mcstar> at the end of the game
2011-05-02T17:36:38  <mcstar> but
2011-05-02T17:36:52  <mcstar> even if i rewrite the cpp bug

2011-05-02T17:36:57  <mcstar> sry
2011-05-02T17:37:05  <mcstar> and dump any input it gets
2011-05-02T17:37:12  <mcstar> those last lines arent show at all
2011-05-02T17:37:40  <janzert> hmm
2011-05-02T17:37:43  <mcstar> the engine supposedly sends this:
2011-05-02T17:37:46  <mcstar> end
2011-05-02T17:37:48  <mcstar> players 4
2011-05-02T17:37:49  <mcstar> score 1 1 1 6
2011-05-02T17:37:50  <janzert> sigh is the one to really look into it

2011-05-02T17:37:58  <mcstar> f 19 63
2011-05-02T17:38:00  <mcstar> go
2011-05-02T17:38:01  <mcstar> for every bot in the end
2011-05-02T17:38:15  <janzert> only to the bots that survive to the end
2011-05-02T17:38:25  <mcstar> for every bot
2011-05-02T17:38:30  <mcstar> ends
2011-05-02T17:38:30  <janzert> and my guess is that the call to game.finish_game is marking all bots not alive
2011-05-02T17:38:32  <mcstar> players
2011-05-02T17:38:34  <mcstar> scores
2011-05-02T17:38:35  <mcstar> go
2011-05-02T17:38:38  <mcstar> are sent to every bot
2011-05-02T17:38:51  <mcstar> aha
2011-05-02T17:38:58  <janzert> well someone changed the specs then if that is true
2011-05-02T17:39:07  <janzert> and also impossible to do in the general case
2011-05-02T17:39:11  <mcstar> in antimatroid's cpp bot he checks for end

2011-05-02T17:39:26  <janzert> most bots wont be running by the end of the game
2011-05-02T17:39:48  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-05-02T17:39:51  <mcstar> why wont they?
2011-05-02T17:40:04  <janzert> because they'll be shut down after they are dead
2011-05-02T17:40:18  <mcstar> but then they cant get the players/score info
2011-05-02T17:40:36  <janzert> btw, I'm still completely opposed to giving that information to bots at all
2011-05-02T17:40:37  <mcstar> look at this
2011-05-02T17:40:40  <mcstar> middle of the page
2011-05-02T17:40:43  <mcstar> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ant-bot-input-output
2011-05-02T17:40:51  <mcstar> rly?
2011-05-02T17:40:58  <janzert> yes :)
2011-05-02T17:41:14  <janzert> so I'm probably not the guy to try and get to fix it ;)
2011-05-02T17:41:23  <mcstar> im just wondering what good it is?
2011-05-02T17:41:33  <mcstar> can the bots write to files?
2011-05-02T17:41:43  <janzert> on the real server it is completely useless and encourages bad behavior
2011-05-02T17:41:48  <janzert> no they aren't suppose to
2011-05-02T17:41:59  <mcstar> so they cant communicate with the outside world
2011-05-02T17:42:10  <janzert> can't do that either
2011-05-02T17:42:24  <janzert> and no state is carried from one game to the next
2011-05-02T17:42:30  <mcstar> then theres no point in sending any end-game parameters
2011-05-02T17:42:35  <janzert> each game is as if the bot was just uploaded
2011-05-02T17:42:38  <janzert> exactly
2011-05-02T17:42:47  <mcstar> ok ill rewrite mine then
2011-05-02T17:42:52  <mcstar> not to use end at all
2011-05-02T17:42:57  <tvorryn> what are the steps to compile and test a java bot?
2011-05-02T17:43:28  <mcstar> dunno
2011-05-02T17:43:42  <mcstar> but theres a makefile in the directory
2011-05-02T17:43:52  <mcstar> have u tried that?
2011-05-02T17:44:02  <janzert> tvorryn: sorry I really don't know either
2011-05-02T17:44:59  <tvorryn> i assume you change the play_one_game script to something like "java path/to/dir/FileName.class"
2011-05-02T17:45:24  <janzert> also guessing from the makefile it looks like it is just "javac MyBot.java" to compile it first
2011-05-02T17:45:39  <mcstar> i think u have to get a jar file
2011-05-02T17:45:53  <mcstar> but thats right, u have to change that string
2011-05-02T17:46:00  <mcstar> to java -jar MyBot.jar
2011-05-02T17:46:03  <mcstar> or something
2011-05-02T17:46:14  <janzert> the makefile doesn't seem to create a jar
2011-05-02T17:46:25  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-02T17:46:28  <tvorryn> i manually compiled the files into .class files and tried runing that, then tried jarring it and running it
2011-05-02T17:46:34  <tvorryn> i got funy errors both time
2011-05-02T17:47:04  <janzert> does it work with the default bots?
2011-05-02T17:47:06  <tvorryn> do makefiles work on Windows?
2011-05-02T17:47:16  <mcstar> if u have make
2011-05-02T17:47:17  <janzert> they can but you need to get make installed
2011-05-02T17:47:24  <tvorryn> yeah, it'll play a game with he python bots
2011-05-02T17:47:34  <mcstar> u need a linux environment
2011-05-02T17:47:37  <mcstar> cygwin
2011-05-02T17:47:44  <tvorryn> install cygwin you mean?

2011-05-02T17:55:44  <mcstar> its the same for me :(
2011-05-02T17:56:43  <janzert> tvorryn: to double check the bot itself is working you can type in "ready" the press enter and should get "go" back from the bot
2011-05-02T17:56:58  <janzert> mcstar: what is the same for you?
2011-05-02T17:57:11  <mcstar> it still not works
2011-05-02T17:57:24  <janzert> do you have MyBot.class file in the directory you run "java MyBot" in?
2011-05-02T17:57:30  <mcstar> i have
2011-05-02T17:57:37  <tvorryn> janzert: it replies go, thanks for the tip
2011-05-02T17:57:57  <mcstar> javac *.java
2011-05-02T17:58:00  <mcstar> then
2011-05-02T17:58:03  <mcstar> java MyBot
2011-05-02T17:58:09  <mcstar> or java MyBot.class
2011-05-02T17:58:20  <mcstar> the same error as before

2011-05-02T17:58:24  <mcstar> and what he got
2011-05-02T17:58:39  <janzert> hmm, weird
2011-05-02T17:59:02  <janzert> btw, just javac MyBot.java should compile everything needed
2011-05-02T17:59:08  <mcstar> the compilations works, theres a corresponding .class for every .java
2011-05-02T17:59:11  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-02T17:59:15  <mcstar> ill try that
2011-05-02T17:59:16  <janzert> not that *.java should hurt anything
2011-05-02T17:59:41  <mcstar> hm
2011-05-02T17:59:44  <mcstar> its different
2011-05-02T17:59:48  <mcstar> javac MyBot.java
2011-05-02T17:59:55  <mcstar> and i get A LOT of errors
2011-05-02T18:00:08  <mcstar> 2 page full of MyBot.java:3: cannot find symbol
2011-05-02T18:00:26  <janzert> :(
2011-05-02T18:00:28  <mcstar> and i have sun jdk/jre

2011-05-02T18:00:47  <mcstar> not that i care about java in any way :)
2011-05-02T18:00:55  <mcstar> i just wanted to try it
2011-05-02T18:01:52  <janzert> unfortunately I'm about at the limit of my java debugging ability :P
2011-05-02T18:01:57  <tvorryn> now ... how do i see the results of the game? i read something about starting up a server ...
2011-05-02T18:02:10  <janzert> think I'm using openjdk here but that shouldn't be the problem
2011-05-02T18:02:45  <mcstar> in ants/visualizer open up copy_paste.html
2011-05-02T18:02:46  <janzert> look in visualizer directory at visualize_locally.py
2011-05-02T18:02:57  <mcstar> or that
2011-05-02T18:03:01  <janzert> or use the copy paste method :)
2011-05-02T18:03:17  <mcstar> you tell him,
2011-05-02T18:03:46  <janzert> go ahead, I haven't actually done the visualize_locally method either ;)
2011-05-02T18:04:04  <janzert> just saw the conversation that is there now
2011-05-02T18:04:43  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-02T18:04:46  <mcstar> tvorryn:
2011-05-02T18:04:50  <mcstar> open that file
2011-05-02T18:04:55  <mcstar> done it?

2011-05-02T21:26:43  <antimatroid> .. the engine should be sending end to every bot on the turn they stop participarting
2011-05-02T21:26:53  <antimatroid> or at the end for local engines
2011-05-02T21:27:07  <antimatroid> and bots can write to file locally for training purposes
2011-05-02T21:27:26  <antimatroid> a bot that is submitted to the servers should already be "trained" if that's what one wants to do though
