2010-11-14T00:01:44  <antimatroid> phreeza: how's your bot doing with the new maps
2010-11-14T00:02:40  <antimatroid> janzert: any idea how much crashes have spiked?
2010-11-14T00:03:22  <janzert> not anything hard no, but errors per minute seems to be relatively stable
2010-11-14T00:03:26  <janzert> http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-11-14T00:03:36  <janzert> actually right now it's really really low
2010-11-14T00:03:53  <antimatroid> that was my biggest worry
2010-11-14T00:03:55  <janzert> but it always varies around quite a bit
2010-11-14T00:03:56  <antimatroid> actually breaking lots of bots
2010-11-14T00:03:59  <phreeza> new maps are online?
2010-11-14T00:04:00  <janzert> yep
2010-11-14T00:04:08  <janzert> phreeza: yep
2010-11-14T00:04:14  <phreeza> cool
2010-11-14T00:04:20  <antimatroid> i've found a couple of examples where the bot seems to be doing worse
2010-11-14T00:04:23  <phreeza> let me see my bot
2010-11-14T00:04:33  <antimatroid> but overall win/loss ratios seem about the same
2010-11-14T00:04:36  <phreeza> urgh i'm actually totally drunk
2010-11-14T00:04:37  <antimatroid> phreeza: link? :P
2010-11-14T00:05:14  <antimatroid> janzert: those errors are compilation and not crashes yeah?
2010-11-14T00:05:21  <phreeza> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=3891
2010-11-14T00:05:44  <janzert> those are any errors in a game
2010-11-14T00:05:49  <janzert> not compilation at all
2010-11-14T00:06:10  <antimatroid> ah okay, cool
2010-11-14T00:06:15  <antimatroid> phreeza: your bot seems to like them
2010-11-14T00:06:16  <janzert> to be clear I'm talking about the errors per minute listed under the workers
2010-11-14T00:07:01  <phreeza> at what time were new maps introduced, server time?
2010-11-14T00:07:45  <antimatroid> i wouldn't mind knowing that if possible actually

2010-11-14T00:11:42  <phreeza> thx
2010-11-14T00:12:04  <antimatroid> i think there might be a slight bias towards placing planets further from the centre of the circle
2010-11-14T00:12:17  <antimatroid> because points selected closer to the centre are more likely to be rejected
2010-11-14T00:12:20  <antimatroid> but meh
2010-11-14T00:13:29  <antimatroid> oldman i'm worried about
2010-11-14T00:14:57  <phreeza> tcp is still using the old maps?
2010-11-14T00:15:24  <antimatroid> yeah, no one has seen dhartmei
2010-11-14T00:15:25  <phreeza> ie dhartmei is MIA?
2010-11-14T00:15:30  <antimatroid> deepblue is crashing too
2010-11-14T00:15:30  <phreeza> ok
2010-11-14T00:15:51  <phreeza> i'm off to sleep
2010-11-14T00:15:58  <antimatroid> it's just a max planet problem, that's alright

2010-11-14T00:17:16  <burny> the top 100 bots, do the battles normally go fo rhte full 200rounds, or mostly end fast?
2010-11-14T00:17:48  <antimatroid> burny: depends on the bots and the map
2010-11-14T00:17:57  <antimatroid> it varies quite a lot
2010-11-14T00:18:08  <antimatroid> i'm hoping there wont be many draws anymore but we'll see
2010-11-14T00:19:52  <antimatroid> dimkakimon's ranking is certainly going up after the change
2010-11-14T00:20:10  <antimatroid> no way i'm letting him take first place for australia over me
2010-11-14T00:20:18  <burny> lol
2010-11-14T00:22:04  <antimatroid> bix0r4ever got one over bocsimacko
2010-11-14T00:22:35  <krokkrok> hehe. that bot is prescentient
2010-11-14T00:24:28  <krokkrok> i just went back and read Accoun's complaint about 'chiting' and there is a way to avoid this accusation in the future
2010-11-14T00:25:04  <krokkrok> the problem is, there is no way for anyone to prove that cheating has not taken place, because the ELO system is so random
2010-11-14T00:25:18  <antimatroid> haha
2010-11-14T00:25:42  <janzert> gah, at least please talk about the right thing the ELO system isn't random at all
2010-11-14T00:25:45  <antimatroid> i think with a live leaderboard, if people cared, they could screen shot all the games they've had
2010-11-14T00:25:50  <janzert> the tournament pairing used is
2010-11-14T00:25:57  <antimatroid> then they can't bitch
2010-11-14T00:26:01  <krokkrok> doesnt matter.
2010-11-14T00:26:07  <krokkrok> because we can see games that weren't run
2010-11-14T00:26:13  <krokkrok> i mean, that were run, but not listed
2010-11-14T00:26:23  <antimatroid> you can see them?
2010-11-14T00:26:27  <antimatroid> what?
2010-11-14T00:26:41  <krokkrok> the outcome of these tournaments is not objecitve, therefore, cheating is always possible
2010-11-14T00:27:29  <krokkrok> if, as accoun asserts, the judges were cheating, then, they can leave out games in which bots win, and so make it appear another bot is the leader.  the process is not open and objective.  I know you are not cheating, but you can't prove it
2010-11-14T00:27:35  <janzert> I think you're looking for deterministic
2010-11-14T00:27:51  <antimatroid> if you don't trust the organisers not to cheat, you shouldn't compete
2010-11-14T00:27:59  <antimatroid> organisers could always cheat if they really wanted
2010-11-14T00:28:05  <krokkrok> NOT SO
2010-11-14T00:28:07  <antimatroid> they aren't getting any money for this
2010-11-14T00:28:20  <krokkrok> it is possible to rate some contests where the organizers cannot cheat
2010-11-14T00:28:27  <antimatroid> how?
2010-11-14T00:28:35  <antimatroid> as you said, games might not be shown that were played
2010-11-14T00:28:48  <janzert> if organizers want to cheat it's easier to cheat by throwing the results of games than removing games I think
2010-11-14T00:28:49  <krokkrok> well, I have a post in the forums that sort of covers this
2010-11-14T00:28:51  <antimatroid> the code for the contest is open source, that is pretty open if you ask me
2010-11-14T00:29:10  <krokkrok> please, think about it. if you wanted to cheat in an undetectable way, you could
2010-11-14T00:29:22  <janzert> of course
2010-11-14T00:29:26  <krokkrok> this is why Accoun can accuse you and you cannot really defend yourself
2010-11-14T00:29:41  <janzert> you have to trust the organizers no matter what
2010-11-14T00:29:47  <krokkrok> NOT SO
2010-11-14T00:29:58  <Accoun> last year chiting: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=366&start=30#p2151
2010-11-14T00:30:13  <Accoun> and this  http://openpaste.org/en/19644/ writen actions
2010-11-14T00:30:19  <krokkrok> if the contest were originally setup as I say in my forum post, transitive and objective, then there could be no undetectable cheating
2010-11-14T00:30:29  <antimatroid> Accoun: I'm pretty sure the rankings weren't reset when the final tournament started, and that really could explain discrepencies in game numbers
2010-11-14T00:30:36  <antimatroid> and you would expect old shit bots to have the most games
2010-11-14T00:31:28  <krokkrok> i really do suggest you guys think this through before the next contest.  Completely open and fair contests, that have  clear objective and calculable winner can be created.
2010-11-14T00:32:07  <antimatroid> i don't want the problems to be too specific, this is an ai contest, and you're never going to get a perfect ordering, it's just not going to happen
2010-11-14T00:32:19  <krokkrok> I can. why cant you?
2010-11-14T00:32:42  <krokkrok> because of this reason only: you have not thought about it enough.
2010-11-14T00:32:51  <antimatroid> i am not an organiser
2010-11-14T00:33:24  <krokkrok> well, you just said "you're never going to", im not sure to whom you were referring
2010-11-14T00:34:12  <krokkrok> it  really bugs me when you say "its just not going to happen", this sort of thinking is very frustrating
2010-11-14T00:37:10  <antimatroid> i mean that from a it can't  happen
2010-11-14T00:37:23  <antimatroid> i have no authority to say what will or will not happen for these contests
2010-11-14T00:38:01  <antimatroid> i mean that it can't actually happen* that first line made no sense aha
2010-11-14T00:38:42  <amstan> Accoun: lol.. janzert is canadian?
2010-11-14T00:38:54  <amstan> Accoun: never knew that, i guess we all learn new things every day
2010-11-14T00:45:41  <janzert> yeah, I never knew that before either ;)

2010-11-14T00:51:25  <amstan> any news on clojure? the guy is pretty insistent
2010-11-14T00:51:37  <janzert> no not really
2010-11-14T00:51:45  <amstan> can i tell him something?
2010-11-14T00:51:46  <amstan> like
2010-11-14T00:51:55  <amstan> will you be able to implement it by the deadline?
2010-11-14T00:52:22  <janzert> I really don't know
2010-11-14T00:52:49  <janzert> it would increase the chances if he can add information to the issue here http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=66&q=clojure#makechanges
2010-11-14T00:53:04  <janzert> on how to install it on ubuntu 8.04
2010-11-14T00:54:14  <janzert> also being that only 3 people have ever starred that issue I'm not real enthused about it
2010-11-14T00:54:32  <janzert> so have him get people that are going to use clojure to start it too :)

2010-11-14T01:35:39  <a1k0n> i haven't really been keeping up
2010-11-14T01:35:56  <antimatroid> it says you're online on the forums :P
2010-11-14T01:36:01  <a1k0n> oh haha
2010-11-14T01:36:17  <antimatroid> have you looked at games on the official site at all today?
2010-11-14T01:36:46  <a1k0n> nope
2010-11-14T01:37:02  <antimatroid> line symmetric maps have been added
2010-11-14T01:37:11  <antimatroid> and up to 5 neutral planets starting at an equal distance
2010-11-14T01:37:18  <antimatroid> and number of planets ranges from 15 to 30
2010-11-14T01:37:24  <a1k0n> huh
2010-11-14T01:37:31  <a1k0n> wow
2010-11-14T01:37:42  <a1k0n> ooh and the player is updated
2010-11-14T01:38:05  <a1k0n> oh and you can wipe the slider at the bottom, rad
2010-11-14T01:38:38  <antimatroid> yes, but the new maps are the "cool" part
2010-11-14T01:38:48  <antimatroid> i think they're cool, some don't like the change
2010-11-14T01:39:07  <a1k0n> oh wow, found one
2010-11-14T01:40:20  <antimatroid> like?
2010-11-14T01:40:39  <a1k0n> a line symmetric one.  yeah, neat.  i dunno.  i don't really have an opinion.
2010-11-14T01:41:19  <a1k0n> 30 planets is.. ok.  starting to be painful.
2010-11-14T01:41:34  <antimatroid> people didn't want to go above 32 because of people using bitmaps
2010-11-14T01:41:45  <antimatroid> line symmetric maps are what i care about
2010-11-14T01:41:49  <antimatroid> it's way  more general
2010-11-14T01:41:53  <a1k0n> yeah
2010-11-14T01:41:58  <a1k0n> tron was line symmetric.. eventually
2010-11-14T01:42:04  <antimatroid> i thought they did both?
2010-11-14T01:42:12  <a1k0n> well, yeah.  it was both.
2010-11-14T01:48:10  <mega1> we can also discusss the maps themselves but the decision to stir the pot this late is more fitting for sports with paying viewership
2010-11-14T01:48:29  <a1k0n> haha.  well, yes.
2010-11-14T01:48:43  <a1k0n> indeed.  symmetric maps aren't as big a deal as increasing the number of planets
2010-11-14T01:49:21  <mega1> or decreasing
2010-11-14T01:49:42  <a1k0n> i was considering hardcoding 23
2010-11-14T01:49:45  <antimatroid> i had always expected such maps
2010-11-14T01:49:51  <antimatroid> it was always expected they'd change for tron
2010-11-14T01:49:54  <a1k0n> but yeah i figured it was coming
2010-11-14T01:50:06  <a1k0n> right, they announced immediately the final tournament would be on bigger maps for tron
2010-11-14T01:50:14  <mega1> another big change is how many planets are usually the same distance from both player
2010-11-14T01:50:14  <antimatroid> and then didn't even do it
2010-11-14T01:50:18  <antimatroid> which i didn't like
2010-11-14T01:50:24  <McLeopold> antimatroid: how about radial symmetry on 3 lines?
2010-11-14T01:50:39  <antimatroid> McLeopold: considered that, never did it
2010-11-14T01:50:44  <antimatroid> could do it on n lines
2010-11-14T01:50:45  <mega1> the new maps are more rock-paper-scissors I think
2010-11-14T01:50:47  <McLeopold> yea
2010-11-14T01:50:54  <McLeopold> mega1: that is a good thing
2010-11-14T01:51:02  <antimatroid> mega1: i think that'd be middle planets
2010-11-14T01:51:09  <antimatroid> i would have thought such situations are better
2010-11-14T01:51:20  <antimatroid> perhaps not when you don't repeat the same game lots
2010-11-14T01:51:44  <antimatroid> i've always wanted the most general maps possible, see whose ai really is best
2010-11-14T01:52:02  <mega1> forget about AI
2010-11-14T01:52:08  <mega1> it's only in the name
2010-11-14T01:52:25  <antimatroid> depends what one means when they say ai :P
2010-11-14T01:52:31  <mega1> nobody has true AI and there is no universally superior solution

2010-11-14T01:57:50  <mega1> I see no activity on zerviz
2010-11-14T01:58:01  <mega1> is there a tcp server with the new maps?
2010-11-14T01:58:19  <antimatroid> i think mcleopold did one
2010-11-14T01:58:29  <McLeopold> yep
2010-11-14T01:58:35  <McLeopold> port 995 now
2010-11-14T01:58:43  <McLeopold> I'm still working on canvas
2010-11-14T01:58:47  <McLeopold> but you can play
2010-11-14T01:59:12  <McLeopold> there is a big old NaN in the middle of the visualizer
2010-11-14T02:00:21  <mega1> that's zeroviz, right? I see only two McBots there
2010-11-14T02:00:27  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-14T02:00:30  <McLeopold> that's it
2010-11-14T02:01:27  <antimatroid> hmm, there was more rankings before?
2010-11-14T02:01:37  <McLeopold> if I can figure out dprintf, I think we are a go

2010-11-14T02:01:56  <McLeopold> I got the latest code from dhartmei's server and reinstalled
2010-11-14T02:02:11  <McLeopold> The old one was doing really crazy things to the games
2010-11-14T02:02:24  <McLeopold> If a planet hit 0 from an enemy, it would switch sides anyway
2010-11-14T02:02:41  <McLeopold> I was losing to ZooRage
2010-11-14T02:03:22  <McLeopold> um.. can you try port 995, so I can see if my firewall is correct?

2010-11-14T02:07:49  <McLeopold> 995 is the tcp port

2010-11-14T02:10:39  <McLeopold> canvas.c doesn't work
2010-11-14T02:10:54  <McLeopold> I tried the old one, but it's not reading the files correctly.
2010-11-14T02:11:01  <antimatroid> hmm okay
2010-11-14T02:11:13  <McLeopold> you can see the data string messed up if you view source
2010-11-14T02:11:35  <McLeopold> the funny thing is, the new one runs fine on the command line
2010-11-14T02:11:41  <McLeopold> just not off the thttpd server

2010-11-14T02:12:51  <mega1> the old tcp server doesn't have the maps
2010-11-14T02:13:01  <antimatroid> he's down to 241 now
2010-11-14T02:13:13  <amstan> antimatroid: what was he before?
2010-11-14T02:13:14  <antimatroid> he's resubmitted a couple of times, and doesn't seem to be handling the maps well
2010-11-14T02:13:17  <antimatroid> top 30 i think
2010-11-14T02:13:27  <antimatroid> i expect they're having a very bad time atm
2010-11-14T02:13:49  <antimatroid> deepblue is also crashing, but i'm pretty sure that's just a no planets issue
2010-11-14T02:15:07  <antimatroid> other than that i've seen no major differences so far
2010-11-14T02:15:19  <antimatroid> but there probably are other examples
2010-11-14T02:15:31  <amstan> wait.. so.. maps are already in there?
2010-11-14T02:15:34  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-14T02:15:49  <antimatroid> janzert did it earlier
2010-11-14T02:16:27  <amstan> mega1: your bots is doing well then on the last 2 games
2010-11-14T02:16:34  <antimatroid> although, a lot of his losses are from him not expanding anywhere
2010-11-14T02:16:43  <antimatroid> amstan: quite a few of the games are on new maps
2010-11-14T02:16:55  <amstan> not for mega1

2010-11-14T02:17:14  <antimatroid> there are older games still up yeah?
2010-11-14T02:17:18  <janzert> since shortly after 18:00
2010-11-14T02:17:21  <amstan> yeah, but he only had one game on the new maps
2010-11-14T02:17:36  <antimatroid> amstan: no
2010-11-14T02:17:40  <janzert> yes, the old games are still there
2010-11-14T02:17:43  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7246869
2010-11-14T02:17:44  <antimatroid> that's a new map
2010-11-14T02:17:45  <mega1> yes, I'm losing more but it's early still
2010-11-14T02:17:59  <antimatroid> one of the losses was a point symmetric map
2010-11-14T02:18:00  <janzert> the switchover was 18:04 or whatever I said before
2010-11-14T02:18:07  <antimatroid> actually, two were

2010-11-14T02:55:29  <amstan> so..
2010-11-14T02:55:32  <amstan> wait till the game ends
2010-11-14T02:55:33  <amstan> and stops
2010-11-14T02:55:38  <amstan> then hover over a planet
2010-11-14T02:55:45  <amstan> before hovering it's at 58/58
2010-11-14T02:55:51  <amstan> after it goes to 59/58
2010-11-14T02:56:03  <McLeopold> what browser?
2010-11-14T02:56:09  <amstan> chrome
2010-11-14T02:56:14  <antimatroid> yeah, i have that with chrome
2010-11-14T02:56:42  <McLeopold> I don't see it
2010-11-14T02:57:31  <antimatroid> i have to let the game fully play
2010-11-14T02:57:32  <McLeopold> weird, now I do
2010-11-14T02:57:44  <McLeopold> and the map was a different size...
2010-11-14T02:57:46  <antimatroid> and once you fix it, you wont get it till you replay it
2010-11-14T02:58:11  <janzert> yeah, I think my fixes earlier uncovered that
2010-11-14T02:58:12  <McLeopold> that's because it was designed to play 1 extra turn
2010-11-14T02:58:22  <McLeopold> only when playing
2010-11-14T02:58:32  <janzert> before it would throw an exception before advancing the the number I guess

2010-11-14T03:05:40  <antimatroid> you want lots of bots to play on the same map
2010-11-14T03:05:51  <antimatroid> otherwise it's too much luck with the map you're generated
2010-11-14T03:06:13  <antimatroid> ideally i think one wants a set of maps that are quite different, then have lots of games on them

2010-11-14T03:07:17  <antimatroid> to what issue?
2010-11-14T03:07:49  <antimatroid> it was more a comment about it being boring watching games on the same maps
2010-11-14T03:08:02  <mega1> "not good for results"
2010-11-14T03:08:11  <mega1> and "interesting"
2010-11-14T03:08:29  <antimatroid> i think the new maps provide more possible scenarios, making it more interesting
2010-11-14T03:08:48  <antimatroid> and i think the ai bots should be ranked about how good they are on general maps
2010-11-14T03:08:52  <mega1> but how is it "not good for results"?
2010-11-14T03:09:07  <antimatroid> it would be bad for results for any generator if every game was on a brand new map
2010-11-14T03:09:48  <antimatroid> because bots have different strengths and weaknesses, it's better (imo) to have a small set of unknown maps for an actual contest, but not with bots playing each other twice on the same map
2010-11-14T03:10:02  <antimatroid> i don't think anything changes with quality of results between the two generators
2010-11-14T03:10:19  <mega1> I see
2010-11-14T03:10:28  <antimatroid> agree or disagree?
2010-11-14T03:10:56  <antimatroid> it'd certainly be more interesting to watch games if it was always a new map
2010-11-14T03:11:47  <antimatroid> wtf
2010-11-14T03:11:56  <antimatroid> accouns ranking just went from 2nd to 12th without any new games
2010-11-14T03:12:04  <mega1> raschi resubmitted
2010-11-14T03:12:12  <antimatroid> ahh :P
2010-11-14T03:14:32  <mega1> with a small set of maps you risk not representing the true distribution of maps, but can better ensure that players get to play the same maps
2010-11-14T03:15:20  <mega1> ... which doesn not necessarily mean much because it's not a one player game.
2010-11-14T03:15:56  <mega1> That is, you ideally want to have a big, representative sample and every possible pairing on every map.
2010-11-14T03:16:43  <antimatroid> yep, but huge round robbins aren't possible, so it's a trade off of having enough variety but not too much
2010-11-14T03:17:04  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4205), bix0r4ever(4030), dmj111(3939), george(3907), GreenTea(3884), _Astek_(3872), asavis(3861), felixcoto(3852), shangas(3841), DarthMasta(3835)
2010-11-14T03:17:34  <mega1> If you don't do all pairings on each map then you open the door for A) maps suiting a player B) maps suiting a player against a certain other player
2010-11-14T03:18:10  <mega1> I _think_ A is stronger than B.
2010-11-14T03:18:13  <antimatroid> yes, but if you do all pairings on each map, you don't get to do it for very many maps, so you also have the problem of luck of map generation
2010-11-14T03:18:31  <mega1> antimatroid: I'm proposing anything, just trying to analyze it.
2010-11-14T03:18:44  <antimatroid> yes, i'm just offering my thoughts :)

2010-11-14T03:24:46  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-14T03:24:58  <antimatroid> i'm not sure about that
2010-11-14T03:25:08  <antimatroid> i think one needs to be better at expanding defensively
2010-11-14T03:25:11  <antimatroid> if that makes sense
2010-11-14T03:25:17  <antimatroid> as your angles get closer
2010-11-14T03:25:21  <mega1> I think it's just noise in the results.
2010-11-14T03:25:33  <mega1> considering that my nash bot is not better than on the old maps.
2010-11-14T03:25:58  <McLeopold> this about this...
2010-11-14T03:26:23  <McLeopold> consider 2 growth 5 planets on the left, and 2 growth 1 on the right, fairly close
2010-11-14T03:26:37  <McLeopold> that would be a line symmetrical map
2010-11-14T03:26:52  <McLeopold> a point symmetrical would have a growth 5 and 1 on the left and right
2010-11-14T03:27:30  <antimatroid> what for?
2010-11-14T03:27:36  <McLeopold> so, across the line, there sections that are more valuable
2010-11-14T03:27:55  <McLeopold> where as before, if you opponent when left, you naturally when right
2010-11-14T03:28:04  <McLeopold> *went*
2010-11-14T03:29:05  <McLeopold> this means, I believe quicker matches, because often bots will need to throw resources to the correct side, which is near each other
2010-11-14T03:29:18  <antimatroid> has anyone seen a single draw on the new maps with different bots?
2010-11-14T03:29:21  <McLeopold> that happens less often when your dancing around a center point
2010-11-14T03:29:26  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-14T03:29:29  <McLeopold> testmap9
2010-11-14T03:29:42  <McLeopold> but that was because of a close start without good planets
2010-11-14T03:30:27  <McLeopold> who's mb08?
2010-11-14T03:30:28  <antimatroid> yeah okay, there should be at least one neutral people can take
2010-11-14T03:30:35  <McLeopold> that one had 2
2010-11-14T03:30:53  <McLeopold> but there was still no good 3 planet
2010-11-14T03:31:20  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2010-11-14T03:31:21  <McLeopold> I think maybe you need to have at least 6 growth in the planets worth taking
2010-11-14T03:31:44  <McLeopold> more than the start, so they don't just funnel back to the start
2010-11-14T03:31:59  <McLeopold> something needs to draw them away from that position
2010-11-14T03:32:31  <McLeopold> with good old map30, it was very close, but still prone to draws
2010-11-14T03:32:48  <antimatroid> varying starting growth would spice things up
2010-11-14T03:33:06  <antimatroid> atm it's basically never a good idea to forfeit your home planet
2010-11-14T03:33:26  <McLeopold> it would be nice to see a map where it was. :)
2010-11-14T03:33:27  <antimatroid> not near the start anyway
2010-11-14T03:34:00  <McLeopold> but, I don't think that would exist
2010-11-14T03:34:08  <McLeopold> Unless you start on a growth 0
2010-11-14T03:34:42  <McLeopold> antimatroid, I'm going to try 3 spokes for the symmetry
2010-11-14T03:34:55  <McLeopold> at 4 and 5
2010-11-14T03:35:46  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-14T03:36:41  <Mjothvitnir> wait I actually won one
2010-11-14T03:36:44  <McLeopold> actually, at more than 2, you can create interesting patterns
2010-11-14T03:36:57  <McLeopold> You must be mb08?
2010-11-14T03:37:01  <Mjothvitnir> :)
2010-11-14T03:37:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yeah, they'd be like rotating stars etc.
2010-11-14T03:37:30  <McLeopold> well, consider 5 points, with one pointing up
2010-11-14T03:37:54  <antimatroid> http://i.imgur.com/TfTBN.png that's the best random map i've generated
2010-11-14T03:38:27  <McLeopold> or wait, consider 12 spokes, so we can talk about number on a clock
2010-11-14T03:38:42  <McLeopold> let's say the starting planets are at 10 & 2
2010-11-14T03:39:04  <McLeopold> you can create a set of 2 planets at 9 and 3 that are the same, and maintain symmetry
2010-11-14T03:39:21  <McLeopold> then, you can create 3 at 8, 4 and 6
2010-11-14T03:39:38  <McLeopold> then, 4 at 10,2,8 and 4
2010-11-14T03:39:52  <McLeopold> or 4 at 3,6,9,12
2010-11-14T03:40:14  <McLeopold> basically you can layer different radial symmetries onto 1 map
2010-11-14T03:40:27  <antimatroid> another option is to parition the circle into n pies, then generate a planet inside the first, and radially place another copy in every othe rpie
2010-11-14T03:41:06  <antimatroid> that would give my rotating stars maps
2010-11-14T03:41:10  <antimatroid> like star fish
2010-11-14T03:41:14  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-14T03:41:26  <McLeopold> that's kinda the same thing
2010-11-14T03:41:31  <antimatroid> i liked the double helix like map
2010-11-14T03:41:41  <McLeopold> ?
2010-11-14T03:41:47  <antimatroid> it was with the oringal set
2010-11-14T03:41:57  <McLeopold> what number?
2010-11-14T03:42:01  <antimatroid> hmm no idea
2010-11-14T03:42:24  <antimatroid> it was like two circling lines crossing over, (like a double helix :P)
2010-11-14T03:43:04  <Mjothvitnir> wow, 2 out of 10, not bad for a bot with a rotten post for a brain
2010-11-14T03:43:16  <McLeopold> I gotta let you play flag now
2010-11-14T03:43:27  <antimatroid> Mjothbitnir: opinions on the maps?
2010-11-14T03:44:21  <McLeopold> Mjothvitnir: connect up again
2010-11-14T03:44:27  <McLeopold> flag is waiting
2010-11-14T03:44:39  <McLeopold> there you go
2010-11-14T03:44:44  <antimatroid> i do feel quite a few of the neutrals where the planets angles are close end up being redundant
2010-11-14T03:44:54  <flag> Get ready to win =)
2010-11-14T03:45:07  <antimatroid> the minimum distance between angles could possibly be revised
2010-11-14T03:45:07  <Mjothvitnir> my only opinion is that the original example maps should have contained a better cross section of possibilities (or in other words I wish they had been around sooner.)
2010-11-14T03:45:35  <McLeopold> we gotta get more people
2010-11-14T03:45:48  <McLeopold> and JBotManager needs a random pause
2010-11-14T03:45:53  <antimatroid> one of the problems with setting very specific details on maps early is that it isn't always clear what kinds of maps will result in the most interesting games
2010-11-14T03:45:55  <lavalamp_> more people where?
2010-11-14T03:46:06  <McLeopold> my tcp
2010-11-14T03:46:08  <antimatroid> http://zeroviz.us:8080/
2010-11-14T03:46:11  <McLeopold> port 995
2010-11-14T03:46:21  <lavalamp_> is it fixed now?
2010-11-14T03:46:26  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-14T03:46:32  <lavalamp_> cool, one sec
2010-11-14T03:47:14  <Mjothvitnir> possibly, but also with more than one type of map in the starting pool, I think more people would have had a better idea what was meant
2010-11-14T03:48:29  <Mjothvitnir> more people playing with different symmetries, overlays etc
2010-11-14T03:49:32  <lavalamp_> oof, the air is rare on this server
2010-11-14T03:49:47  <McLeopold> what does that mean?
2010-11-14T03:50:17  <lavalamp_> everyone is better than me :/
2010-11-14T03:50:22  <McLeopold> oh
2010-11-14T03:50:34  <McLeopold> Do you miss Rage?
2010-11-14T03:50:40  <McLeopold> :P
2010-11-14T03:50:55  <Mjothvitnir> you must not have played my rotten-post bot yet
2010-11-14T03:52:07  <antimatroid> i don't think ragebot could ever beat me
2010-11-14T03:52:30  <lavalamp_> no mb08 beats me too :/
2010-11-14T03:52:58  <lavalamp_> mine plays better in general if I leave out the anti-ragebot code :/
2010-11-14T03:53:34  <burny> that means that other AI's are weak then(or your nati-rage code is faulty)
2010-11-14T03:53:58  <antimatroid> burny: often there's a trade off, and it depends whether your enemy expands or not
2010-11-14T03:54:19  <antimatroid> if they fully expand and you do reservedly, you might lose, but if you expand fully and they send nothing, they will win
2010-11-14T03:54:20  <antimatroid> etc. etc.
2010-11-14T03:54:22  <burny> good AI will rage, if rage will be successful
2010-11-14T03:54:37  <burny> if they fully expand, then you should rage them
2010-11-14T03:54:52  <antimatroid> but you might have sent too much out expanding cautiously
2010-11-14T03:55:16  <antimatroid> hence the tradeoff
2010-11-14T03:55:30  <burny> if they're fully expanding, and you can't rage.. then you should expand more also
2010-11-14T03:55:35  <antimatroid> i don't think any bot could ever ALWAYS win this game, you just need to win the most
2010-11-14T03:55:42  <antimatroid> but what if they waited?
2010-11-14T03:55:52  <burny> then they didn't expand obviously
2010-11-14T03:56:16  <antimatroid> no, consider three options on the first move {do nothing, expand catiously, expand fully}
2010-11-14T03:56:21  <lavalamp_> all out expand beats reserved expand beats ragebot beats all out expand
2010-11-14T03:56:22  <antimatroid> my point is that that can sometimes be rps
2010-11-14T03:56:23  <burny> if(opponent.expanded == true) expand more  else expand less
2010-11-14T03:56:43  <antimatroid> well, not exactly, but be sort of similar
2010-11-14T03:56:48  <lavalamp_> burny, but you're a turn behind by the time you figure out what they're doing
2010-11-14T03:57:15  <McLeopold> I think burny's right
2010-11-14T03:57:34  <antimatroid> how? we're talking about what to do on the first move
2010-11-14T03:57:38  <antimatroid> you have no information about your opponent
2010-11-14T03:57:39  <burny> well, my AI will stomp, nearly 100% of the time, any bot that expands agressivly on first move
2010-11-14T03:57:58  <McLeopold> no, he said if the opponent does x, then do y.  That's after the first turn
2010-11-14T03:58:09  <burny> because I will expand cautiously on first move, and then rage them
2010-11-14T03:58:09  <antimatroid> burny: if people expand catiously and you didn't, you wont be able to take them and they will grow faster than you
2010-11-14T03:58:15  <lavalamp_> depends on map, too, my bot does ok on distant starting maps
2010-11-14T03:58:28  <antimatroid> my old bot did what you suggest, but i found it didn't do well against the better bots who could expand catiously
2010-11-14T03:58:47  <burny> I read that as "better bots do better"?
2010-11-14T03:59:46  <burny> I think what you're saying though.. is that the better bots never(or rarely) go into rage mode/
2010-11-14T04:00:10  <lavalamp_> oh hey I can beat mb08 sometimes
2010-11-14T04:00:43  <Mjothvitnir> 50-50
2010-11-14T04:01:00  <antimatroid> no, waht i'm saying is the better bots expand as much as they can, but not so much that they're left vulnerable
2010-11-14T04:01:13  <antimatroid> you don't want to expand to a planet you're going to lose
2010-11-14T04:01:13  <burny> so, why don't you do that too?
2010-11-14T04:01:25  <antimatroid> even if you recoup the ships you spent before you lose it, the other player then gets that growth
2010-11-14T04:01:41  <antimatroid> i am in the middle of a clean rewrite that hopefully will
2010-11-14T04:01:59  <antimatroid> my old bot was 2 months worth of trying ideas
2010-11-14T04:02:06  <antimatroid> i wanted cleaner code with less bugs
2010-11-14T04:02:12  <antimatroid> particulary for the final tournament
2010-11-14T04:02:15  <burny> against good AI: rage should never win(and only tie certain maps)
2010-11-14T04:02:27  <antimatroid> like i said, i shouldn't ever lose to rage bot
2010-11-14T04:02:32  <antimatroid> i haven't in like 2 months
2010-11-14T04:02:36  <burny> and on nearly 100% of maps, maximum expansion should get demolished
2010-11-14T04:02:50  <flag> I find that erasing half my code greatly improves my performance on these new maps
2010-11-14T04:02:59  <antimatroid> that isn't something i was saying is a smart idea :P

2010-11-14T04:05:37  <burny> for me the hardest part is going to be the end-game code
2010-11-14T04:06:25  <burny> like, on turn 183, it's worth sending 200ships at a 1growth plane with 10ships, even if it can be taken back a few turns later
2010-11-14T04:06:42  <antimatroid> simple, if my payoff is negative, i don't make a move
2010-11-14T04:06:48  <burny> one of the opponents planets I mean, not neutral
2010-11-14T04:07:49  <antimatroid> there's no point sending any fleets that don't arrive before the end
2010-11-14T04:08:02  <antimatroid> and there's no point expanding if the return at the end is less than it cost
2010-11-14T04:08:12  <antimatroid> otherwise i think it's worth sending

2010-11-14T04:18:20  <McLeopold> antimatroid: overall, these new maps are more exciting
2010-11-14T04:18:21  <burny> woah, the ratigns have droped a bunch
2010-11-14T04:18:34  <McLeopold> much more cutthroat
2010-11-14T04:19:08  <lavalamp_> oh hey I actually did ok there for a while
2010-11-14T04:19:25  <antimatroid> McLeopold: more exciting/interesting was the plan
2010-11-14T04:19:37  <McLeopold> I think if you hadn't launched that 400 from the bottom, you would have one

2010-11-14T04:20:58  <lavalamp_> McLeopold good point, I'll have to fix that :/

2010-11-14T04:21:35  <antimatroid> damn, if only that neutral had like 2 ships instead of 6
2010-11-14T04:21:53  <antimatroid> i don't think you guys picked the best planet either
2010-11-14T04:21:55  <McLeopold> still draw
2010-11-14T04:22:03  <McLeopold> no, we did
2010-11-14T04:22:16  <antimatroid> say you go for the 10
2010-11-14T04:22:17  <McLeopold> well, maybe not
2010-11-14T04:22:29  <antimatroid> i think you'd have done better going for the 10
2010-11-14T04:22:31  <McLeopold> everything in the center would have been sniped
2010-11-14T04:22:40  <antimatroid> not if they make a move too
2010-11-14T04:22:50  <antimatroid> oh, yeah probably
2010-11-14T04:22:52  <McLeopold> yeah, true
2010-11-14T04:22:57  <lavalamp_> My bot would go for the 6 and the 10
2010-11-14T04:23:04  <lavalamp_> and get crushed :(
2010-11-14T04:23:28  <McLeopold> hmm..., it's odd that we both picked very poor planets
2010-11-14T04:23:39  <McLeopold> I suppost one should just wait forever on that map
2010-11-14T04:23:56  <antimatroid> then you lose to what you guys just did
2010-11-14T04:24:05  <antimatroid> that maps actually quite interesting now :P
2010-11-14T04:24:30  <McLeopold> it is very much a draw map
2010-11-14T04:24:38  <antimatroid> i dunno
2010-11-14T04:24:44  <antimatroid> i think if you do separate moves it wouldn't be
2010-11-14T04:24:53  <antimatroid> and not sure any move is optimal
2010-11-14T04:25:01  <McLeopold> okay, consider 2 planets with a neutral right in the middle with 30 ships.
2010-11-14T04:25:04  <lavalamp_> if one of you had gone for the 47 + 1 instead, then maybe you could take the 6 in the middle
2010-11-14T04:25:07  <McLeopold> that is a draw map, no questions
2010-11-14T04:25:24  <McLeopold> split the center into 2, still with 30
2010-11-14T04:25:34  <McLeopold> again, draw
2010-11-14T04:25:43  <McLeopold> because they can be sniped
2010-11-14T04:25:51  <antimatroid> not if they move too
2010-11-14T04:25:56  <McLeopold> if every planet along the center can be sniped, it is a poor map
2010-11-14T04:26:00  <antimatroid> you are relying on them waiting to snipe you
2010-11-14T04:26:14  <McLeopold> it's the best strategy for that type
2010-11-14T04:26:16  <burny> what's sniped mean?
2010-11-14T04:26:23  <antimatroid> offense
2010-11-14T04:26:29  <antimatroid> :p
2010-11-14T04:26:37  <McLeopold> burny: landing 1 turn later after their ships are absorbed by the neutral ships
2010-11-14T04:26:43  <lavalamp_> snipe = you take a planet right after your opponet did
2010-11-14T04:26:46  <antimatroid> people refer to sniping as taking the planet just after the enemy took it from being a neutral
2010-11-14T04:27:05  <antimatroid> i always have the least efficient explanations :(
2010-11-14T04:27:06  <burny> shouldn't the middle be snipable on nearly 100% of maps?
2010-11-14T04:27:24  <antimatroid> there are cases where you should send everything you have at the middle planet
2010-11-14T04:27:37  <antimatroid> otherwise a perfect bot will beat you
2010-11-14T04:27:39  <McLeopold> Nope, consider a growth 5 with 4 ships closer to you
2010-11-14T04:27:44  <McLeopold> Un snipable
2010-11-14T04:27:59  <burny> if it's closer to you, then it's not in the middle?
2010-11-14T04:28:27  <McLeopold> still, if it's equal distance, unshipable
2010-11-14T04:28:33  <McLeopold> uh, snipable
2010-11-14T04:28:47  <burny> ya, that's just a draw map then though
2010-11-14T04:28:51  <McLeopold> if they arive 1 turn late, you will have already gained ships
2010-11-14T04:28:59  <burny> if hte best strat is to just send your entire army to the middle ever turn
2010-11-14T04:29:24  <McLeopold> if there are 2 or more in the center, then it's a guessing game
2010-11-14T04:30:28  <burny> except that then, most likely(assuming you don't pick the same one), the best move will just be to attack their middle from yours
2010-11-14T04:31:20  <antimatroid> the other thing before was, the centre planet was exactly halfway between teh two bots
2010-11-14T04:31:23  <antimatroid> that's no longer the case
2010-11-14T04:31:29  <antimatroid> not for line symmetry
2010-11-14T04:31:51  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I don't think tri-symmetry will work
2010-11-14T04:31:57  <McLeopold> or three slices
2010-11-14T04:32:14  <antimatroid> picking home planets?
2010-11-14T04:33:10  <McLeopold> one bot may be draw toward the opponent and another away
2010-11-14T04:33:37  <Mjothvitnir> huh?
2010-11-14T04:34:37  <McLeopold> I'd have to split it into 6 slices, then mirror adjacent slices
2010-11-14T04:34:46  <McLeopold> the home planets would need to be on the line
2010-11-14T04:35:17  <Mjothvitnir> what is wrong with three?
2010-11-14T04:35:20  <antimatroid> ELO's are below 4000
2010-11-14T04:35:44  <McLeopold> consider the points of a clock with the follow growths at each number
2010-11-14T04:35:53  <McLeopold> 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4
2010-11-14T04:35:58  <McLeopold> from 1 to 12
2010-11-14T04:36:11  <Mjothvitnir> ok
2010-11-14T04:36:33  <McLeopold> if 2 of the growth 4's are the home planets, at 1oclick and 5
2010-11-14T04:36:55  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/profile_games.php?user_id=10474 accounts like that should be disabled
2010-11-14T04:37:02  <McLeopold> wait, 4oclock and 8 oclock
2010-11-14T04:37:45  <Mjothvitnir> yes
2010-11-14T04:37:46  <McLeopold> janzert: ^^
2010-11-14T04:38:27  <McLeopold> okay so, 4 and 8 o clock starting positions will both naturally want to go counter-clockwise
2010-11-14T04:38:48  <McLeopold> 8oclock runs into the opponent, 4oclock runs into free neutrals
2010-11-14T04:38:52  <McLeopold> it's unbalanced
2010-11-14T04:39:08  <McLeopold> but, consider this layout on the clock
2010-11-14T04:39:11  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2010-11-14T04:39:28  <antimatroid> it was like when i put centre neutrals in point symmetric maps but not doubled on both sides
2010-11-14T04:39:39  <antimatroid> technically it was symmetric at the start, but the games weren't fair
2010-11-14T04:39:42  <McLeopold> 2,1,2,4,2,1,2,4,2,1,2,4
2010-11-14T04:40:32  <antimatroid> actually, i guess technically it wasn't
2010-11-14T04:41:02  <McLeopold> yeah, it was just repeated
2010-11-14T04:41:17  <McLeopold> that's why I need 6 slices with every other one mirrored
2010-11-14T04:41:37  <antimatroid> hmm, max distance was always 24 yeah?
2010-11-14T04:41:49  <antimatroid> Mistmanov thinks it was 34
2010-11-14T04:42:01  <McLeopold> it was higher than 24
2010-11-14T04:42:13  <antimatroid> ah crap, that needs changing then
2010-11-14T04:42:22  <McLeopold> but, that was corner to corner
2010-11-14T04:42:35  <antimatroid> were maps inside a square before?
2010-11-14T04:42:42  <Mjothvitnir> yes
2010-11-14T04:42:42  <McLeopold> yea
2010-11-14T04:42:50  <antimatroid> i don't think it matters, i think the radius should be extended then
2010-11-14T04:42:57  <Mjothvitnir> they were 24 squares
2010-11-14T04:43:07  <McLeopold> okay, but you gotta check the radius with the angle
2010-11-14T04:43:45  <antimatroid> what?
2010-11-14T04:43:51  <Mjothvitnir> a 12 rad circle is bound by a 24 square
2010-11-14T04:44:28  <Mjothvitnir> (the circle just crops the corners of the square)
2010-11-14T04:44:29  <McLeopold> a 24x24 square has a corner to corner of 24*sqrt(2)
2010-11-14T04:44:34  <antimatroid> you've got what, maxD = sqrt(2*24^2)?
2010-11-14T04:44:47  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-14T04:45:20  <antimatroid> janzert: can you change the maxRadius to 17 in the map generator please
2010-11-14T04:45:32  <antimatroid> so it's consistent with old max distances
2010-11-14T04:45:32  <McLeopold> 33.9411
2010-11-14T04:45:40  <antimatroid> :P close enough
2010-11-14T04:46:09  <McLeopold> you just have to check your x and y cords after converting to cartiesian
2010-11-14T04:46:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it's easiest to just change the variable for max radius
2010-11-14T04:47:03  <McLeopold> okay, but you might generate stuff outside the box
2010-11-14T04:47:37  <antimatroid> how?
2010-11-14T04:47:51  <antimatroid> oh yeah, but that's fine
2010-11-14T04:47:52  <Mjothvitnir> with 17, the circle will bound the box not the box bound the circle
2010-11-14T04:48:06  <antimatroid> you want to capture the maximum distance
2010-11-14T04:48:39  <Mjothvitnir> max dist is the same but play area is larger
2010-11-14T04:48:43  <antimatroid> btw, 33.94 distance rounded up to 34 anyway, it's fine to just use max radius of 17
2010-11-14T04:48:56  <McLeopold> k
2010-11-14T04:50:49  <flag> McLeopold: Could you put AntBot back up? I want to see how I do against it
2010-11-14T04:51:10  <McLeopold> k

2010-11-14T04:51:44  <antimatroid> oldman's really struggling
2010-11-14T04:51:54  <antimatroid> i have no idea what would cause him to crash :|
2010-11-14T04:51:59  <McLeopold> hmm, tri-symmetry would actually just be line symmetry
2010-11-14T04:52:16  <McLeopold> planet count is my guess
2010-11-14T04:52:36  <antimatroid> i don't think so, he makes it through most of the games before crashing
2010-11-14T04:52:46  <antimatroid> deepblue crashes at the start whenever there are more than 23 planets
2010-11-14T04:53:08  <McLeopold> you know what that mean...
2010-11-14T04:53:15  <McLeopold> 2 week extension!
2010-11-14T04:53:35  <antimatroid> they wont extend the deadline
2010-11-14T04:53:39  <McLeopold> flag: not looking good if you made changes
2010-11-14T04:53:57  <antimatroid> well, i very much doubt it from my limited experience
2010-11-14T04:54:14  <McLeopold> antimatroid: actually, I never noticed it was always 23 planets until about a week ago
2010-11-14T04:54:30  <flag> McLeopold: no kidding
2010-11-14T04:54:35  <flag> Okay, you can take it off now
2010-11-14T04:54:39  <flag> I need some sleep
2010-11-14T04:54:41  <antimatroid> i never realised only the centre planet could have 0 growth till i was writing the new generator
2010-11-14T04:55:05  <McLeopold> that crashed my bot sooo much
2010-11-14T04:56:11  <antimatroid> varying planets?
2010-11-14T04:56:27  <antimatroid> i just input them into a vector on the first pass of the gamestate and update every turn thereafter
2010-11-14T04:56:47  <antimatroid> the only thing that would break my bot would be blowing out the max distance and number of planets quite a bit
2010-11-14T04:57:28  <antimatroid> and it wouldn't actually break, probably just make really stupid moves
2010-11-14T04:57:38  <antimatroid> or run out of memory eventually
2010-11-14T04:58:00  <McLeopold> I think mine just gets slower
2010-11-14T04:58:13  <antimatroid> i have timers telling it when to stop
2010-11-14T04:58:25  <antimatroid> so in theory you would have to use up all memory before it would break
2010-11-14T04:58:30  <McLeopold> I ought to do that
2010-11-14T04:58:52  <antimatroid> i don't make assumptions :P
2010-11-14T05:00:44  <antimatroid> computers should support elliptical windows
2010-11-14T05:00:47  <antimatroid> with resizing
2010-11-14T05:00:54  <antimatroid> that'd be cool
2010-11-14T05:10:36  <Accoun> http://ai-contest.com/ down
2010-11-14T05:12:01  <antimatroid> seems up for me

2010-11-14T05:18:40  <McLeopold> so, has anyone used a java bot with the tcp program?
2010-11-14T05:19:29  <antimatroid> someone must have
2010-11-14T05:22:08  <Mjothvitnir> define "tcp program"
2010-11-14T05:22:27  <McLeopold> dhartmei's tcp.c
2010-11-14T05:22:30  <McLeopold> I got it working
2010-11-14T05:22:38  <McLeopold> RageBot on my tcp. :)
2010-11-14T05:23:14  <antimatroid> you sound so proud :P
2010-11-14T05:23:16  <Mjothvitnir> no. (I was using java bot with tcp.jar and with jbotmanager)
2010-11-14T05:23:35  <McLeopold> it was more of a "nevermind"

2010-11-14T05:25:12  <antimatroid> hmm, possibly alternative ragebot, having it constantly attack the first planet in the list of planets with all ships it owns
2010-11-14T05:25:22  <antimatroid> or have it send all its ships to the closest enemy every turn
2010-11-14T05:25:34  <antimatroid> i'll make that after
2010-11-14T05:26:09  <antimatroid> that'd actually be a pretty good bot to test with
2010-11-14T05:27:54  <Mjothvitnir> do you mean each planet sends to it's closest so that it is attacking (possibly) more than one planet a turn
2010-11-14T05:28:36  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-11-14T05:28:40  <antimatroid> sorry
2010-11-14T05:29:47  <Mjothvitnir> take out the 10* growth restrictor and ragebot will do that

2010-11-14T05:30:27  <antimatroid> probably not exactly as i'd like
2010-11-14T05:30:36  <antimatroid> i want it to go for it's closest expected enemy
2010-11-14T05:30:44  <antimatroid> not the closest planet the enemy already owns
2010-11-14T05:31:44  <Mjothvitnir> closest planet enemy has fleets headed for?
2010-11-14T05:32:00  <Mjothvitnir> owns or has fleets headed for
2010-11-14T05:32:03  <antimatroid> closest planet that is owned by the enemy when the fleets arrive
2010-11-14T05:32:10  <antimatroid> and only send enough to "take it" then go for the next one
2010-11-14T05:32:25  <antimatroid> it'd be super rage bot
2010-11-14T05:32:35  <antimatroid> i'd probably also have it do nothing on the first move
2010-11-14T05:32:49  <antimatroid> i think people would find that a bit more painful
2010-11-14T05:33:30  <Mjothvitnir> so if you don't send enough to take the planet it ignores that one
2010-11-14T05:33:43  <antimatroid> no
2010-11-14T05:33:53  <antimatroid> but if it has more than needed, it moves onto the next planet with the rest
2010-11-14T05:34:27  <Mjothvitnir> sorry I was refering to "owned by the enemy when the fleets arrive"
2010-11-14T05:36:24  <Mjothvitnir> in other words, if "I" send one ship to the neutral closest to it home planet will it attack that planet
2010-11-14T05:37:00  <antimatroid> bix0r4ever has a good record against bocsimacko on the new maps

2010-11-14T05:37:47  <lavalamp_> ooo poor mega1
2010-11-14T05:37:56  <antimatroid> it's still early
2010-11-14T05:38:07  <antimatroid> can some other people analyse the games?
2010-11-14T05:38:12  <mega1> bix0r is reuploading constantly
2010-11-14T05:38:14  <lavalamp_> although bix0r4ever had a goodish (the best?) record against him before
2010-11-14T05:38:21  <mega1> yes
2010-11-14T05:38:35  <amstan> mega1: oh yeah.. lol .. he has 2 games
2010-11-14T05:38:41  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-11-14T05:38:44  <amstan> mega1: 1 win against you
2010-11-14T05:38:44  <antimatroid> ah, that'll do it
2010-11-14T05:39:10  <antimatroid> i was going to say, no bot has come close to touching mega1
2010-11-14T05:39:14  <lavalamp_> mega1's win rates against everyone else keep him on top
2010-11-14T05:39:18  <antimatroid> even with a few wins against him
2010-11-14T05:39:25  <amstan> actually.. no
2010-11-14T05:39:33  <amstan> he seems to loose constantly against bix

2010-11-14T05:40:20  <mega1> it's 13 to 2 total
2010-11-14T05:40:21  <lavalamp_> yeah I recall a few days ago noting that bix0r won a lot vs bocsi
2010-11-14T05:40:36  <amstan> mega1: for him?
2010-11-14T05:40:39  <mega1> for me
2010-11-14T05:40:43  <amstan> oh
2010-11-14T05:40:53  <mega1> but that include that last couple of days
2010-11-14T05:41:13  <amstan> he didn't reupload that constantly..
2010-11-14T05:41:20  <lavalamp_> hey I wish my bot would go 2-13 vs bocsi...
2010-11-14T05:41:23  <antimatroid> no, but he did then, which always overshoots

2010-11-14T05:45:23  <antimatroid> it's not very ragebotty
2010-11-14T05:45:38  <McLeopold> that is ragebot
2010-11-14T05:45:50  <McLeopold> it's the example bot
2010-11-14T05:46:13  <antimatroid> did it always start making lots of moves like that?
2010-11-14T05:46:26  <McLeopold> yeah, 1 move per planet owned

2010-11-14T06:09:53  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: then make some :P
2010-11-14T06:10:02  <lavalamp_> maybe I will :p
2010-11-14T06:10:26  <lavalamp_> also how about maps where you make it fair by tiling instead of symmetry?
2010-11-14T06:10:35  <lavalamp_> maybe I will do that too
2010-11-14T06:10:42  <antimatroid> fair by tiling?
2010-11-14T06:11:01  <lavalamp_> yeah, so you have a random group of planets
2010-11-14T06:11:12  <antimatroid> it's not even sufficient for a map to be symmetric in order for it to be fair
2010-11-14T06:11:35  <antimatroid> wait, no, i went over that before
2010-11-14T06:11:37  <antimatroid> yes it is
2010-11-14T06:11:38  <lavalamp_> repeat it 4 times over the board (rotating/mirroring as needed) and each player gets a starting planet in two of the groups, diagonal from each other
2010-11-14T06:11:39  <antimatroid> ignore me
2010-11-14T06:11:47  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-11-14T06:12:11  <lavalamp_> hm actually if you do that maybe the map would be symmetric
2010-11-14T06:12:21  <antimatroid> it would
2010-11-14T06:12:23  <lavalamp_> ignore me too
2010-11-14T06:12:33  <antimatroid> i think sufficiency is equivalent to a fair match
2010-11-14T06:12:36  <antimatroid> iff etc. etc.
2010-11-14T06:12:45  <antimatroid> sufficiency == symmetry

2010-11-14T06:13:15  <lavalamp_> ah, but an infinitely tiled map could be fair and not symmetric
2010-11-14T06:13:18  <antimatroid> i don't think the new generator is far off being able to make all possible maps
2010-11-14T06:13:30  <Frontier> looks like there was not much damage to the rankings with the new maps. all the bots seem to work more or less on them
2010-11-14T06:13:44  <antimatroid> Frontier: i'm very worried about oldman

2010-11-14T06:15:13  <antimatroid> so i don't think it's just a matter of number of planets
2010-11-14T06:15:19  <lavalamp_> hm if the game were played on the surface of an octohedron that could be really interesting
2010-11-14T06:15:44  <lavalamp_> or other geometric solid
2010-11-14T06:15:44  <Frontier> well, did anyone send an email notification about the changes?
2010-11-14T06:15:55  <lavalamp_> anyway I go code now
2010-11-14T06:16:04  <antimatroid> is it just me, or did most of the maps end up with more than 23 planets?
2010-11-14T06:16:22  <antimatroid> Frontier: don't think so, but he's seen the changes, he has resubmitted a couple of times
2010-11-14T06:17:02  <antimatroid> mega1: back where you belong :)

2010-11-14T06:17:13  <antimatroid> perfect timing
2010-11-14T06:17:18  <mega1> it's pretty hectic
2010-11-14T06:17:28  <antimatroid> a lot of people are resubmitting too
2010-11-14T06:17:46  <Frontier> maybe he doesnt know the maximum planet count. *sigh* why was there no email. this is like when i code something at 10 pm
2010-11-14T06:18:14  <antimatroid> i would expect bots to crash on the first turn if there was an issue with planet counts
2010-11-14T06:18:38  <antimatroid> i wonder how many bots are like oldmans
2010-11-14T06:18:42  <antimatroid> that's the biggest issue i've found
2010-11-14T06:18:51  <Frontier> what if they just don't know about the other planets and suddenly receive a source planet id of 29?
2010-11-14T06:19:14  <antimatroid> they had to process it at the start too
2010-11-14T06:19:18  <Frontier> if all loops iterate from 0 to 22, that could be possible
2010-11-14T06:20:22  <antimatroid> it would be a bad mistake if all loops went from 0 to 22
2010-11-14T06:20:25  <Frontier> hmm, i get your point, you actually had to code in an abort after line 23 of planet input ^^
2010-11-14T06:20:36  <antimatroid> and how the hell does one test on maps with like 3 or 4 planets if your bot can only handle that?
2010-11-14T06:21:19  <antimatroid> i don't know how people have worked out their strategies if they haven't used small examples like that
2010-11-14T06:22:41  <Frontier> i never used small examples actually ^^. It was always using the 23 planets sets. And it worked ok. Just now I changed some ownerships so half the map belongs to each player to test some defense code.

2010-11-14T06:23:56  <Frontier> I could have written a bot that reads planets from stdin, and ignores them if their id is above 22. not very bright, but possible :)
2010-11-14T06:24:51  <antimatroid> very unbright :P
2010-11-14T06:24:57  <Frontier> so it works with smaller sizes, but not larger sets. and it looks like the bot wont crash - until the fleets come into play
2010-11-14T06:25:01  <antimatroid> i read the planets and just add however many i get to a vector
2010-11-14T06:26:35  <antimatroid> Error323: your bot seems to like the new maps
2010-11-14T06:26:41  <Frontier> i do the same, it's just my new bot uses fixed size arrays and copies the data from the framework into these arrays as a first step (filtering out fleet.source and other unimportant information)
2010-11-14T06:27:08  <antimatroid> i did fixed arrays etc. for tron, i can't be bothered for this
2010-11-14T06:27:10  <antimatroid> it's too messy

2010-11-14T06:42:15  <boegel> controversial, it seems :)
2010-11-14T06:43:16  <antimatroid> it was a fairly even split as far as i'm concerned
2010-11-14T06:43:23  <antimatroid> and it was always intended to change
2010-11-14T06:43:44  <antimatroid> the rankings seem about the same so far too
2010-11-14T06:43:47  <antimatroid> excepting oldman
2010-11-14T06:44:54  <mega1> the rankings have 2.5 days worth of old games too for those who have not resubmitted

2010-11-14T07:26:24  <antimatroid> i will when it's running
2010-11-14T07:26:45  <antimatroid> i have watched those 3 losses, what are your thoughts on them?
2010-11-14T07:26:57  <antimatroid> do you think it was strictly a result of the map generator change?
2010-11-14T07:27:05  <antimatroid> you would be the best judge of that
2010-11-14T07:27:15  <mega1> I have to rewatch them, wait a sec
2010-11-14T07:28:38  <antimatroid> the most recent loss was a drastically different map to old ones
2010-11-14T07:28:45  <antimatroid> the other two not so much
2010-11-14T07:28:53  <mega1> the first and the third ones look to me like r-p-s
2010-11-14T07:28:58  <mega1> the second, I don't know
2010-11-14T07:29:26  <antimatroid> do you think rps situations are good or bad
2010-11-14T07:29:34  <antimatroid> my first thoughts are yes, but i'm not sure
2010-11-14T07:29:53  <antimatroid> i think multiple neutrals significantly increases the chances of those sitation

2010-11-14T08:17:35  <antimatroid> hmmm, i'm not sure
2010-11-14T08:17:55  <antimatroid> i would have thought draws should count too
2010-11-14T08:18:59  <dmj111> yeah, there is a difference between losing 4 out of 4, to losing 4 out of 10, with 6 draws.
2010-11-14T08:19:06  <dmj111> it looks like there is a log message when a draw happens, maybe someone with access can see how often it happens
2010-11-14T08:20:07  <antimatroid> you probably need to talk to janzert for anything like that
2010-11-14T08:20:14  <antimatroid> and he's going away tomorrow/today
2010-11-14T08:20:17  <antimatroid> for a few days
2010-11-14T08:21:02  <dmj111> ok.  if I see him, I'll ask.  I also realize it is kind of late for something like that.
2010-11-14T08:21:17  <dmj111> I was just curious if it was ever brought up, and it doesn't sound like it was.
2010-11-14T08:23:39  <dmj111> antimatroid: i also like the results i get on the new maps :0  my bot seems a little better on them then the other ones.
2010-11-14T08:24:42  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-14T08:24:51  <antimatroid> i haven't got my bot in a working state to have even tried
2010-11-14T08:25:02  <antimatroid> it would be a little funny if i pushed hard and then it really really sucked on them :P
2010-11-14T08:25:39  <antimatroid> the only major problem i've seen is oldman
2010-11-14T08:25:57  <antimatroid> deepblue is also crashing, but i think his problem should be fixed in one line
2010-11-14T08:26:03  <antimatroid> but oldman is crashing mid game
2010-11-14T08:26:49  <dmj111> ha.  i hope you do well :)

2010-11-14T08:38:19  <Zoost> Im getting almost same kind of crashes, luckily not as often. Something in my sniping caused me to crash in almost every game. Now it just happens occasionally when Im gaining the lead in growth (one step before I get neurals)

2010-11-14T10:45:45  <rebelxt_> hey all, who can clarify the map situation? i.e. how come are they changing map generator two weeks before the deadline?
2010-11-14T10:47:47  <antimatroid> there was never a map generator set
2010-11-14T10:47:58  <antimatroid> the new maps are more interesting, and had actually been intended for a while
2010-11-14T10:48:29  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: we were told that the same "old" generator would be used with a new seed
2010-11-14T10:48:36  <antimatroid> where?
2010-11-14T10:48:53  <rebelxt_> IRC, weeks ago
2010-11-14T10:49:14  <antimatroid> anything i'd seen on here from organisers was that it'd change eventually
2010-11-14T10:49:43  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: i do agree maps are more interesting, but last minute changes like this are not a great idea, imho

2010-11-14T10:50:23  <mega1> rebelxt_: the top 100 tends to feel this way
2010-11-14T10:50:32  <mega1> (in my opinion)
2010-11-14T10:50:35  <antimatroid> i think the problem is that about half the people see it as a change and the rest don't
2010-11-14T10:50:43  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: so, i'm looking at the poll on the forums where most people voted against the change, and the change was still made.. what's up with that? ;-) just curious
2010-11-14T10:50:45  <antimatroid> mega1: did you see Xrillo's post in the forums?
2010-11-14T10:50:50  <mega1> no
2010-11-14T10:50:58  <antimatroid> i would be very surprised if i don't make at least the top 50
2010-11-14T10:51:18  <antimatroid> top 10 would be nice

2010-11-14T10:53:03  <antimatroid> no decision had been made prior
2010-11-14T10:53:23  <mega1> I mean the posts that come before his post
2010-11-14T10:53:51  <mega1> just how many times do we confuse final generator and final set of maps
2010-11-14T10:54:05  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: were the poll results ignored? http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1087
2010-11-14T10:54:37  <antimatroid> the poll results were split 50 50 as far as i'm concerned
2010-11-14T10:54:48  <antimatroid> maybe not for wild, but that really wasn't much of a change
2010-11-14T10:54:53  <antimatroid> the big change was line symmetric maps
2010-11-14T10:55:34  <mega1> the big change was more neutral at the same distance from the starting positions
2010-11-14T10:55:54  <rebelxt_> i tested two of my best bots (which use totally different algorithms) on old and new maps.. got different results. they are within 10% but relative strength of my bots changed which means more tuning will be needed
2010-11-14T10:56:19  <antimatroid> i don't tune, i keep refining my general strategy :
2010-11-14T10:56:58  <antimatroid> i prefer to have new maps at the end of a contest like that, i do wish it was made more explicitly clear that it would happen though
2010-11-14T10:57:04  <antimatroid> like this*
2010-11-14T10:57:43  <antimatroid> you could probably fish up forum posts i made from tron asking for general but clear rules :)
2010-11-14T10:59:00  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: even though i doubt this change will affect the final ratings significantly, this is still a bad change. it it was done one month ago, then fine.
2010-11-14T10:59:25  <antimatroid> i don't have any problems with new maps like this at this stage
2010-11-14T10:59:29  <antimatroid> i think it's a good thing
2010-11-14T10:59:50  <antimatroid> my only complaint would be that not all users seeemed to understand that's how the organisers do this
2010-11-14T10:59:55  <antimatroid> they did exactly teh same for tron
2010-11-14T11:00:07  <antimatroid> even a1k0n said before, eventually they added line symmetric maps
2010-11-14T11:02:40  <mega1> let me put this bluntly:
2010-11-14T11:03:08  <mega1> it's not the way to run a fair contest
2010-11-14T11:03:21  <antimatroid> it would be fair if everyone understood it would happen
2010-11-14T11:03:28  <mega1> it wasn't for tron, it's not now
2010-11-14T11:03:33  <mega1> no
2010-11-14T11:04:07  <antimatroid> the rules can be as general as one wants and the contest remain fair, provided they're clear and stuck to
2010-11-14T11:04:10  <mega1> just because your particular approach does not involve tuning you can still imagine that that's not only way
2010-11-14T11:05:13  <mega1> a new set of from a distribution cannot really change the game

2010-11-14T11:05:31  <mega1> a new generator can.
2010-11-14T11:05:52  <antimatroid> not if people are told that isn't the generator that will be used, that it is just to make your own examples with
2010-11-14T11:06:10  <antimatroid> then the game was never restricted to the maps of that generator
2010-11-14T11:06:21  <antimatroid> which in this case I believe the organisers didn't want
2010-11-14T11:06:28  <antimatroid> jeff certainly didn't
2010-11-14T11:06:38  <mega1> can't you see that the set of possible generator is just too large to prepare for that?
2010-11-14T11:06:49  <antimatroid> that's the idea

2010-11-14T11:07:56  <antimatroid> i would have pushed for it a lot earlier, but i didn't have the time
2010-11-14T11:08:08  <antimatroid> i had asked and asked, no one did anything, so i did something for myself
2010-11-14T11:08:20  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: that's my point exactly. you pushed way too late
2010-11-14T11:08:34  <antimatroid> there was never a generator set, someone else could have pushed earlier
2010-11-14T11:08:49  <mega1> wait, I have a great idea for a generator
2010-11-14T11:08:56  <antimatroid> as far as i was concerned, nothing was to be assumed yet about the form final maps will take

2010-11-14T11:46:50  <McLeopold> woah: error in server code? http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=1144
2010-11-14T11:51:32  <antimatroid> which map is that?

2010-11-14T11:51:50  <antimatroid> i agree about that map earlier, it was a wait and draw map
2010-11-14T11:53:28  <McLeopold> okay, so my server is starting to prove that now
2010-11-14T11:53:44  <McLeopold> there are a few others as well, but not as drawish
2010-11-14T11:54:36  <antimatroid> perhaps the neutral needs to be takable and not snipable?
2010-11-14T11:54:47  <antimatroid> that wouldn't be that hard to ensure

2010-11-14T11:59:24  <McLeopold> yea, that would be good
2010-11-14T11:59:43  <McLeopold> but it might make for too obvious of openings
2010-11-14T12:00:03  <McLeopold> as long as there are enough snipable neutrals that you can't snipe them all, that is good too
2010-11-14T12:00:43  <McLeopold> If a map draw on a bad bot against a good one, I'd remove it
2010-11-14T12:00:54  <McLeopold> If it draws between to really good bots, that's okay

2010-11-14T12:05:42  <antimatroid> is it possible to have more than one "snipable" planets that can't be sniped in combinations?

2010-11-14T18:48:32  <antimatroid> people didn't want distances of one, because then you don't ever see the fleet sent by an enemy
2010-11-14T18:48:44  <antimatroid> i wanted distances of one, but i don;t think it was very important
2010-11-14T18:49:40  <antimatroid> burny: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1094
2010-11-14T18:49:45  <antimatroid> that contains accurate information about maps
2010-11-14T18:49:57  <burny> means I don't have to put special code in, to prevent loss of critical troop count on boarder stations
2010-11-14T18:50:16  <antimatroid> well, now it is
2010-11-14T18:50:21  <antimatroid> max dist wil be 34
2010-11-14T18:50:30  <burny> if I have 80, and opponent has 82, we can just swap back and forth until I manage to get reinforcements
2010-11-14T18:50:53  <antimatroid> what do you mean by swap back on forth
2010-11-14T18:51:06  <antimatroid> if you only have 2 more ships, they're going to generate that in growth by the time you get there
2010-11-14T18:51:10  <burny> when they attack me, I can send my ships to whee they came from
2010-11-14T18:52:04  <burny> obviously that has a net-loss.. but if for whatever reason it's important to preserve ships, it's better then losing the fleet
2010-11-14T18:53:56  <burny> ok.. 80 to 90 then, with a distance of 2, and both growing 1
2010-11-14T18:54:19  <burny> if they attack with 85, my best move is probably to attack back with 80
2010-11-14T18:55:24  <burny> will lose 1regen for 1 turn, but if they send the 85 back again, I can scatter my 80 through their base, and then send re-enforcements up, to regain more then just the 1grow
2010-11-14T18:56:11  <sigh> burny: just be aware that you lose 1 turns worth of growth every swap
2010-11-14T18:56:23  <sigh> if you are only reacting to your opponent
2010-11-14T18:56:28  <burny> yes
2010-11-14T18:56:50  <burny> but 1turn of growth can be less important than massive fleet
2010-11-14T18:56:58  <sigh> sure

2010-11-14T18:57:15  <sigh> :)
2010-11-14T18:57:57  <burny> most of all though, if they are barely winning, and they attack. with a distance of 1 you can't respond, but distance of 2 means you can get inside their base
2010-11-14T18:58:39  <antimatroid> i liked how distances of one didn't really provide complete information about the opponent
2010-11-14T18:58:55  <antimatroid> complete information isn't the right word, but you know what i mean

2010-11-14T19:20:28  <burny> so the ranking drops: basically, the new maps are making the top100 bots, not perform as well compared to weaker bots as they used to?

2010-11-14T19:22:58  <antimatroid> hmm, hard to say, probably something like that
2010-11-14T19:23:11  <antimatroid> the top 20 usually play people inside their range
2010-11-14T19:23:19  <antimatroid> and i don't really pay attention to the rest of the leaderboard
2010-11-14T19:23:52  <burny> well the whole top100, droped 400-500 points since yesterday(as a whole, no idea about specific bots)
2010-11-14T19:24:03  <antimatroid> yeah i have noticed that
2010-11-14T19:24:10  <antimatroid> bocsimacko loss rate has risen
2010-11-14T19:24:36  <antimatroid> i wish it hadn't
2010-11-14T19:24:56  <burny> or maybe the ELO highest rating, is based heavily on the win% of the top couple people?
2010-11-14T19:25:14  <antimatroid> i thought it was anchored at the bottom end now, but i could be wrong
2010-11-14T19:25:22  <antimatroid> i'm not sure how that stuff works properly
2010-11-14T19:25:24  <antimatroid> only vaguely
2010-11-14T19:27:29  <burny> do the top bots play stricly against other top bots? or just mostly against tops?
2010-11-14T19:28:21  <antimatroid> just mostly
2010-11-14T19:28:25  <antimatroid> the pairing algorithm favours that
2010-11-14T19:28:26  <burny> cool
2010-11-14T19:28:33  <antimatroid> for the last contest that didn't happen, and it really sucked
2010-11-14T19:28:49  <antimatroid> top bots didn't get anywhere near enough games with each other
2010-11-14T19:29:23  <burny> so wound up with stuff like.. bot #1 won 9/10 games, and bot#2 won 10/10 games, but was rated lower?
2010-11-14T19:29:56  <McLeopold_> http://zeroviz.us:8080/by_Map.html
2010-11-14T19:30:20  <antimatroid> not like that I don't think, just that the ranking between 1 and 2 was more likely to be determined at how many crap bots they beat rather than how they performed against the best bots
2010-11-14T19:30:45  <antimatroid> i got diqualified in that contest anyway, for timing out on a single move :P
2010-11-14T19:30:47  <sigh> elo is anchored to 0 now, yes

2010-11-14T20:41:17  <bhasker> i have a state object that indicates the state of a planet on a particular turn
2010-11-14T20:41:26  <bhasker> i basically maintain a list of state of objects per planet
2010-11-14T20:41:36  <bhasker> rather list of stateObjects
2010-11-14T20:41:40  <McLeopold> I had to factor out my object
2010-11-14T20:41:47  <McLeopold> I use all lists
2010-11-14T20:41:48  <bhasker> so a state is like

2010-11-14T21:25:28  <bhasker> thats a weird map
2010-11-14T21:25:38  <bhasker> how come there is only one map with 17 ships on it?
2010-11-14T21:26:44  <lavalamp_> McLeopold: love the nice ratings grid but it sorts the time columns alphanumerically >.<
2010-11-14T21:27:01  <McLeopold> woops
2010-11-14T21:27:15  <McLeopold> the time since last, or the UTC time?

2010-11-14T21:35:09  <bhasker> he never sniped me
2010-11-14T21:35:11  <bhasker> i took the 8
2010-11-14T21:35:13  <bhasker> with 9 ships
2010-11-14T21:35:21  <bhasker> right next to his biggest planet
2010-11-14T21:35:25  <bhasker> should have techincally lost that game
2010-11-14T21:35:52  <antimatroid> i'm converned about how well bots are now doing against mega1 compared to before
2010-11-14T21:35:57  <antimatroid> concerned*
2010-11-14T21:36:05  <antimatroid> other than that i've seen no real different
2010-11-14T21:36:12  <antimatroid> and that really wasn't my intentions
2010-11-14T21:36:26  <bhasker> hmm if they are doing better why would that be a concern?
2010-11-14T21:36:30  <flag> I'm sure it affected other people too
2010-11-14T21:36:41  <antimatroid> because he has been clearly better than everyone else for a long time
2010-11-14T21:36:43  <bhasker> probably just different maps change his symmetry based assumptions?
2010-11-14T21:36:53  <antimatroid> he has said he doesn't make such assumptions
2010-11-14T21:36:58  <antimatroid> he could be lying, but i don't see why
2010-11-14T21:37:24  <antimatroid> are the new win/loss ratios much different to what he was getting on tcp?
2010-11-14T21:37:25  <flag> Even if he doesn't make assumptions, some constants in his code might be tuned towards the old maps
2010-11-14T21:37:29  <lavalamp_> he's been tuning his eval function for a month, it's extremely likely it was overfitted
2010-11-14T21:37:47  <antimatroid> because the main server was stuck with the original 100 maps till a day ago
2010-11-14T21:37:59  <bhasker> is the bot "a" you antimatroid?
2010-11-14T21:38:05  <antimatroid> no, that's flag
2010-11-14T21:38:12  <antimatroid> i'm in the middle of a rewrite :P
2010-11-14T21:38:15  <bhasker> aah
2010-11-14T21:38:19  <antimatroid> well, i hope i'm more than halfway now
2010-11-14T21:38:21  <flag> I'm in the middle of a rewrite D:
2010-11-14T21:38:48  <antimatroid> flag: i started with a fresh starter to try and clean things up for final submissions
2010-11-14T21:38:54  <antimatroid> the strategy is only minorly different
2010-11-14T21:39:09  <bhasker> i guess i will need to debug a bit more
2010-11-14T21:39:11  <bhasker> getting weird timeouts
2010-11-14T21:39:12  <bhasker> http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=3673
2010-11-14T21:39:27  <flag> I'm trying to go for boscimacko-like dominance with my new bot. I give it about a 1% chance of working out
2010-11-14T21:39:40  <antimatroid> that's a high probability :P
2010-11-14T21:39:46  <flag> haha
2010-11-14T21:39:51  <antimatroid> bhasker: have you got timers stopping you if you're taking too long?
2010-11-14T21:39:56  <antimatroid> that map has more than 23 planets
2010-11-14T21:39:59  <bhasker> nope
2010-11-14T21:40:07  <bhasker> my average turn takes under 200ms
2010-11-14T21:40:11  <bhasker> so no need for timers per se
2010-11-14T21:40:21  <bhasker> the most time i spend is in updating state thats about it
2010-11-14T21:40:26  <bhasker> actual decision making barely takes anytime
2010-11-14T21:40:31  <antimatroid> fair enough
2010-11-14T21:40:40  <antimatroid> i use a decision tree, which will often just take as long as it can
2010-11-14T21:41:23  <bhasker> yea well i don't optimize my decisions
2010-11-14T21:41:41  <lavalamp_> my new tactic: monte carlo to optimize my goal execution, payoff table to select best course of action ^^
2010-11-14T21:41:45  <antimatroid> my pickMoves function is soo inefficient :P

2010-11-14T21:49:09  <antimatroid> yeah, his loss ratio on the main site for new maps is greater than it was even for tcp previously
2010-11-14T21:49:18  <McLeopold> let me know what you think of the mirror and radial maps
2010-11-14T21:49:23  <antimatroid> it's at 90% wins now, but that includes a good day and a half of old map usage
2010-11-14T21:49:49  <McLeopold> antimatroid: i created the radial maps without sin or cos or atan
2010-11-14T21:49:54  <bhasker> let me see how it goes

2010-11-14T21:52:13  <McLeopold> it is, refresh?
2010-11-14T21:52:29  <antimatroid> ah, :P
2010-11-14T21:53:42  <McLeopold> using that, you can sort by draws and see the games that cause them
2010-11-14T21:54:50  <lavalamp_> good thing they forced us to be single threaded or I wouldn't be runnng six bots concurrently...
2010-11-14T21:55:39  <antimatroid> i've never used multiple threads :\
2010-11-14T21:57:05  <antimatroid> also, didn't mcleopold want people not to run so many instances at once?
2010-11-14T21:57:21  <lavalamp_> eek now I'm confused about which server I'm running things on
2010-11-14T21:57:24  <McLeopold> It's on my comcast account.
2010-11-14T21:57:25  <antimatroid> something about only having a comcast account
2010-11-14T21:57:32  <McLeopold> It's not so bad right now.
2010-11-14T21:57:36  <lavalamp_> oh I can stop some
2010-11-14T21:57:45  <lavalamp_> ok let me know if I'm hogging your bandwidth
2010-11-14T21:57:46  <antimatroid> yeah, would be fine now, once more people start using it though

2010-11-14T21:59:34  <antimatroid> he still crashes some time
2010-11-14T21:59:52  <antimatroid> my only worry is the change in bocsimackos performance
2010-11-14T22:00:26  <antimatroid> it could just be more rps like situations
2010-11-14T22:00:33  <McLeopold> it is
2010-11-14T22:01:02  <antimatroid> what is?
2010-11-14T22:01:11  <antimatroid> it'd be a big call to say that's the only reason :P
2010-11-14T22:02:52  <antimatroid> he beat bix0r again :)
2010-11-14T22:03:38  <McLeopold> with radial, planets on the center line are mirrored, so if you opponent goes left, you can usually go right
2010-11-14T22:03:52  <antimatroid> where the hell did sajmon come from?
2010-11-14T22:03:54  <McLeopold> with 0-5 on the line that are unique, it becomes more difficult

2010-11-14T23:07:25  <bhasker> thats the main code
2010-11-14T23:07:30  <bhasker> so planetstate just stores the state
2010-11-14T23:07:40  <bhasker> and updateplanet basically runs through handling all fleet resolutions
2010-11-14T23:07:45  <bhasker> and updating the state at each turn
2010-11-14T23:07:52  <bhasker> it appends a new state object to the planet state list
2010-11-14T23:07:54  <bhasker> at every turn
2010-11-14T23:08:12  <bhasker> so if you see like 33->51
2010-11-14T23:08:17  <bhasker> lines i.e

2010-11-14T23:08:45  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7356348
2010-11-14T23:08:47  <bhasker> this takes over 9ms for all 23 planets
2010-11-14T23:08:57  <bhasker> i can't seem to make it any faster
2010-11-14T23:08:58  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-14T23:09:03  <jmcarthur> wat
2010-11-14T23:09:06  <antimatroid> now i'm really worried
2010-11-14T23:09:13  <jmcarthur> 23 copies takes 9ms?
2010-11-14T23:09:19  <bhasker> no for all 23 planets
2010-11-14T23:09:25  <bhasker> updating states upto
2010-11-14T23:09:27  <bhasker> maxDist*2+1
2010-11-14T23:09:41  <bhasker> so for an average map
2010-11-14T23:09:42  <McLeopold> ill have to think about it later
2010-11-14T23:09:49  <bhasker> about 49-50 state copies
2010-11-14T23:09:51  <bhasker> * 23
2010-11-14T23:09:54  <McLeopold> dmj might help?
2010-11-14T23:09:58  <antimatroid> bocsimacko got beaten by someone in the 600's on the main site!!!
2010-11-14T23:10:03  <antimatroid> that's very worrying
2010-11-14T23:10:21  <bhasker> the main site is running your new maps antimatroid?
2010-11-14T23:10:29  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-14T23:10:37  <bhasker> nice
2010-11-14T23:10:41  <bhasker> since when?
2010-11-14T23:10:43  <lavalamp_> bhasker: that code made me feel a little better about my state keeping code ;)
2010-11-14T23:10:47  <antimatroid> over a day ago
2010-11-14T23:10:49  <bhasker> :D
2010-11-14T23:10:52  <bhasker> my code is messy :-\
2010-11-14T23:11:01  <bhasker> and my python skills aren't the best
2010-11-14T23:11:03  <antimatroid> i'm not very happy with what's happening to bocsimacko
2010-11-14T23:11:10  <bhasker> i tend to code python like C at times:-\
2010-11-14T23:11:16  <burny> did the 600 expand agressively, and the other didn't capitalize on it, and it was a draw map?
2010-11-14T23:11:39  <jmcarthur> bhasker: so the rate is roughly 128 copies/sec?
2010-11-14T23:11:40  <bhasker> why does it matter if mega1's bot does bad?
2010-11-14T23:11:44  <antimatroid> burny: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7356348
2010-11-14T23:11:44  <jmcarthur> that's crazy slow
2010-11-14T23:11:54  <bhasker> yea thats what i figure that its slow:-\
2010-11-14T23:11:54  <burny> I can't see replays ;(
2010-11-14T23:11:55  <lavalamp_> mine is just about as messy but I have it more general (no cases 1-8 or whatever)
2010-11-14T23:11:56  <antimatroid> bhasker: because it's clearly been better than everyone elses
2010-11-14T23:12:00  <bhasker> hmm wait it takes 10ms
2010-11-14T23:12:03  <bhasker> to copy that many
2010-11-14T23:12:06  <jmcarthur> wow
2010-11-14T23:12:16  <jmcarthur> about 115/sec
2010-11-14T23:12:31  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-14T23:12:38  <jmcarthur> that's crazy
2010-11-14T23:12:38  <bhasker> so i figured its quite crappy
2010-11-14T23:12:43  <bhasker> let me do a simple test hold on
2010-11-14T23:13:09  <jmcarthur> what is the algorithmic complexity of list append in python?
2010-11-14T23:13:19  <jmcarthur> and how many elements are in these lists?
2010-11-14T23:13:20  <antimatroid> mega1: i need you to stop doing badly on the new maps :P you're making me reconsider my stance
2010-11-14T23:14:02  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you've only made the contest more difficult, not worse
2010-11-14T23:14:06  <burny> what was the change exactly?
2010-11-14T23:14:21  <antimatroid> it's more difficult yes, but i didn't want to knock the leader off the top
2010-11-14T23:14:21  <burny> but ya, I agree probably with mcleo
2010-11-14T23:14:32  <McLeopold> @rankings
2010-11-14T23:14:32  <bhasker> well jmc the list shouldn't be longer than 40-50 elements
2010-11-14T23:14:33  <contestbot> McLeopold: Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3822), Raschi(3772), asavis(3614), sajmon(3574), protocolocon(3562), bix0r4ever(3560), SUA.khb(3558), dmj111(3541), shangas(3541), george(3533)
2010-11-14T23:14:36  <antimatroid> he's not yet
2010-11-14T23:14:39  <bhasker> since its just one state object per turn
2010-11-14T23:14:43  <antimatroid> but it's certainly changed a lot for him
2010-11-14T23:15:14  <bhasker> and i calculate upto 2*maxDistance+1 states
2010-11-14T23:15:23  <antimatroid> i do + 2
2010-11-14T23:15:23  <bhasker> where maxDist is the maximum distance between two planets
2010-11-14T23:15:37  <lavalamp_> bhasker: I wait to calc states until someone requests it
2010-11-14T23:15:45  <lavalamp_> that might help your copies :/
2010-11-14T23:15:52  <bhasker> not a bad idea
2010-11-14T23:16:03  <bhasker> though 10ms for that many copies is slow
2010-11-14T23:16:04  <bhasker> as hell
2010-11-14T23:16:06  <bhasker> i need to figure out why
2010-11-14T23:16:16  <lavalamp_> ...and if it's that slow to copy maybe you should not, and just recalc all the time
2010-11-14T23:16:27  <bhasker> cause i can't do any kind of complex stuff if just copying state is so expensive
2010-11-14T23:16:57  <jmcarthur> i doubt it's actually the expensive. something sounds wrong
2010-11-14T23:16:58  <bhasker> well i was doing that, but doing recalcs every time makes the code really unweildy
2010-11-14T23:17:01  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-14T23:17:06  <bhasker> i need to figure out what i am doing wrong
2010-11-14T23:17:14  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3822), Raschi(3772), asavis(3614), sajmon(3574), protocolocon(3562), bix0r4ever(3560), SUA.khb(3558), dmj111(3541), shangas(3541), george(3533)
2010-11-14T23:18:58  <burny> anim: unless the map changes makes some naive strat win too often: it should be fine
2010-11-14T23:19:44  <burny> eg. if they're all large enough, that agressive expansion is the best.. or there's always a planet close to middle that has low population, that sending 100% of fleet to that first move, forces a win, or a draw
2010-11-14T23:19:44  <burny> etc.
2010-11-14T23:20:33  <antimatroid> ah, nice catch from dimkadimon on the map generator
2010-11-14T23:21:14  <burny> what was it?
2010-11-14T23:22:12  <antimatroid> num_ships = random.randint(minShips, 5*distance(p1, p2)-1) should be num_ships = min(100, random.randint(minShips, 5*distance(p1, p2)-1)) when selecting the neutrals that can be claimed
2010-11-14T23:22:25  <antimatroid> not that it really matters, but it ensures maps meet the specifications
2010-11-14T23:23:34  <burny> so was just missing a cap of 100 neutrals?
2010-11-14T23:24:34  <burny> what's cap on growthRate?
2010-11-14T23:25:01  <antimatroid> 5
2010-11-14T23:25:06  <antimatroid> and yes, the cap
2010-11-14T23:25:16  <antimatroid> max distance is currently 24 and will be 34
2010-11-14T23:25:43  <antimatroid> burny: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/map_generator.py
2010-11-14T23:25:52  <antimatroid> that's the map generator if you want to make your own test maps
2010-11-14T23:28:20  <bhasker> any other python programmers around?
2010-11-14T23:28:37  <antimatroid> ^^ that was my first piece of python code :P
2010-11-14T23:28:46  <bhasker> http://pastebin.com/ELyVmMhV
2010-11-14T23:28:48  <bhasker> can you run that
2010-11-14T23:29:00  <bhasker> and send what the output is like
2010-11-14T23:29:34  <bhasker> i can't figure out why its printing like 23*100 times the time
2010-11-14T23:29:40  <dmj111> bhasker: i was just reading through your messages, but haven't lookked at your pastes yet.
2010-11-14T23:29:50  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-14T23:30:08  <dmj111> is the last one the one to look at?
2010-11-14T23:30:17  <burny> did it not used to have center planets?
2010-11-14T23:30:29  <bhasker> hmm well that is similar to what my code does
2010-11-14T23:30:32  <bhasker> but here's the main one
2010-11-14T23:30:38  <antimatroid> C:\>file.py
2010-11-14T23:30:39  <antimatroid>   File "C:\file.py", line 1
2010-11-14T23:30:39  <antimatroid> SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xff' in file C:\file.py on line 1, but no enc
2010-11-14T23:30:39  <antimatroid> oding declared; see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html for details
2010-11-14T23:30:48  <bhasker> http://pastebin.com/PP3XPwAK
2010-11-14T23:31:16  <bhasker> hmm is that what you are getting antimatroid?
2010-11-14T23:32:00  <antimatroid> i just ran the one file?
2010-11-14T23:32:04  <antimatroid> was i meant to get the other one too
2010-11-14T23:32:08  <bhasker> hmm no
2010-11-14T23:32:13  <bhasker> weird never got that encoding error before
2010-11-14T23:32:14  <antimatroid> i have no idea about python :P
2010-11-14T23:32:22  <antimatroid> i could have just been retarded somehow
2010-11-14T23:32:59  <TheMacca> do people assess the best moves globally or per planet?
2010-11-14T23:33:06  <TheMacca> I'm assessing per planet and it's ... limiting :)
2010-11-14T23:33:15  <burny> anti: what changed with it? added symmetry type!?
2010-11-14T23:33:20  <burny> type1 I meant
2010-11-14T23:34:33  <dmj111> bhasker: my planet state is just a tuple.  (turn, owner, num_ships).  And turn is just there for debugging.
2010-11-14T23:34:58  <antimatroid> burny: differeing number of planets, two different types of symmetry and multiple "middle" neutrals
2010-11-14T23:35:04  <dmj111> your held ships is probably a hint at something i _should_ do, but don't.
2010-11-14T23:35:12  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-14T23:35:25  <bhasker> heh held ships was something i stole from lavalamp
2010-11-14T23:35:30  <bhasker> but i can't get it to work reliably
2010-11-14T23:35:39  <antimatroid> i have "usableShips"
2010-11-14T23:35:41  <bhasker> i end up sometimes launching less than required
2010-11-14T23:35:42  <burny> did it used to never have 'middle's?
2010-11-14T23:35:55  <burny> and is either of the symmetry type's the original one?
2010-11-14T23:35:57  <antimatroid> it always had a dead centre one, but otherwise no
2010-11-14T23:36:09  <antimatroid> yes, old ones were point symmetric
2010-11-14T23:36:09  <bhasker> themacca i am not even assessing best move
2010-11-14T23:36:17  <bhasker> my best move, is go for the best planet
2010-11-14T23:36:21  <bhasker> if i can't get it
2010-11-14T23:36:24  <bhasker> then try next one
2010-11-14T23:36:25  <bhasker> thats aboutit
2010-11-14T23:36:34  <burny> which of the 2 is the new one? 1 or not 1?
2010-11-14T23:36:39  <TheMacca> bhasker:  Cool
2010-11-14T23:36:50  <TheMacca> are you making that decision on a per-planet (origin) basis
2010-11-14T23:36:55  <bhasker> yes
2010-11-14T23:36:57  <TheMacca> or overall
2010-11-14T23:36:59  <TheMacca> okay
2010-11-14T23:36:59  <bhasker> but i do something like
2010-11-14T23:37:03  <sigh> bhasker: how do you know when to stop?
2010-11-14T23:37:11  <bhasker> so basically at start of turn
2010-11-14T23:37:14  <bhasker> i calculate how many ships i ahve
2010-11-14T23:37:19  <bhasker> then from each source i calculate
2010-11-14T23:37:23  <bhasker> how many ships i would need
2010-11-14T23:37:24  <bhasker> to take it over
2010-11-14T23:37:30  <bhasker> and keep track of how many i have sent before
2010-11-14T23:37:31  <antimatroid> burny: -1 is the new one
2010-11-14T23:37:44  <TheMacca> Okay, that's about what I do
2010-11-14T23:37:48  <bhasker> and also keep track of how many enemy ships the previous launch accounted for
2010-11-14T23:37:54  <TheMacca> (in fact, I think it's exactly what I do)
2010-11-14T23:37:57  <bhasker> so i subtract that many from enemy reinforcements
2010-11-14T23:38:06  <TheMacca> ah, didn't think of that
2010-11-14T23:38:07  <TheMacca> nice :)
2010-11-14T23:38:17  <bhasker> so that way i was not double counting
2010-11-14T23:38:21  <TheMacca> bhasker: reason I ask, is that I see some of the higher ranked bots
2010-11-14T23:38:33  <TheMacca> and they use multiple planets to attack a single destination
2010-11-14T23:38:38  <bhasker> oh my bot does that
2010-11-14T23:38:43  <TheMacca> which I think has a number of advantages
2010-11-14T23:38:48  <bhasker> yes it does
2010-11-14T23:38:51  <TheMacca> oh, I misunderstood then
2010-11-14T23:38:53  <sigh> yeah, that is quite common
2010-11-14T23:38:56  <bhasker> also my bot does synchronized attacks
2010-11-14T23:39:00  <bhasker> which is also something most bots do
2010-11-14T23:39:11  <sigh> I only do sychonized attacks against neutrals
2010-11-14T23:39:17  <TheMacca> sigh: why?
2010-11-14T23:39:17  <bhasker> i launch synchronized against enemy too
2010-11-14T23:39:22  <sigh> for some reason my bot does better with it for normal enemies
2010-11-14T23:39:32  <bhasker> only reinforcements are not synchronized
2010-11-14T23:39:38  <sigh> just the result of tests, no other reason
2010-11-14T23:40:01  <sigh> * does better with sychronised attacked off for normal enemies
2010-11-14T23:40:04  * lavalamp_ skims conversation
2010-11-14T23:40:20  <lavalamp_> bhasker: yeah held ships are freaking hard to get right
2010-11-14T23:40:38  <sigh> what do you mean by held ships? delayed attacks?
2010-11-14T23:40:38  <dmj111> i kind of loop through all my targets, ordered but some hack, and attack the first one that looks feasible.  If I have more time, i do it again, but with my state updated with the launched fleets.  my attacks use whatever i think is available.
2010-11-14T23:41:02  <dmj111> i took it as "reserved for defense against possible attack."  that is what I haven't come close to getting right.
2010-11-14T23:41:10  <TheMacca> dmj111: do you use multiple sources fora single target?
2010-11-14T23:41:14  <lavalamp_> ships at a planet/turn that are reserved for some later use but not dispatched from the planet on that turn
2010-11-14T23:41:16  <dmj111> yes.
2010-11-14T23:41:17  <TheMacca> on a single turn
2010-11-14T23:41:44  <sigh> my overall strategy is to figure out how to attack each target independently, score the planets based on that and then start attacking from highest score down
2010-11-14T23:41:58  <dmj111> still yes.  I launch what I can, but also track launches from future turns from multiple planets, if needed.
2010-11-14T23:42:18  <sigh> how do you guys decide when to stop attacking?
2010-11-14T23:42:30  <TheMacca> I have an ROI threshold
2010-11-14T23:42:41  <burny> stop attackign when you win
2010-11-14T23:42:50  <sigh> burny: I mean on a single turn
2010-11-14T23:43:11  <antimatroid> do you only consider the ships you can send now?
2010-11-14T23:43:22  <dmj111> i just added a 2 ply search, that doesn't launch attacks that the enemy can to better against than if I did nothing.
2010-11-14T23:43:27  <antimatroid> i let my bot send ships that i'm "going to have" at any point in time up to 2*maxd+1
2010-11-14T23:43:31  <sigh> I just go down my list of targets sending attacks until I find one I can't attack then stop
2010-11-14T23:43:48  <dmj111> problem is, that I only consider a small set of "reasonable" attacks, and don't consider enemy moves that I should.
2010-11-14T23:43:50  <TheMacca> sigh, I used to do that
2010-11-14T23:44:20  <sigh> yeah, I understand that it's very simplistic :)
2010-11-14T23:44:20  <dmj111> sigh: If I find one I cannot attack, I keep walking the list to see if there is somethign else to take.
2010-11-14T23:44:48  <dmj111> early on I had bots that gave up attacking, when there was a less desirable, but still good target out there.
2010-11-14T23:44:52  <sigh> dmj111: I've tried that, my bot spread itself too thin and attacked stupid stuff
2010-11-14T23:44:56  <TheMacca> dmj111: sigh's asking, how do you know when to stop looking?
2010-11-14T23:45:00  <TheMacca> because you wind up attacking crap
2010-11-14T23:45:17  <TheMacca> sigh: I evaluate all enemy first, then, when I'm scanning the neutrals
2010-11-14T23:45:25  <TheMacca> if I find one below some threshold that I can't attack
2010-11-14T23:45:26  <TheMacca> I stop
2010-11-14T23:45:42  <dmj111> sigh: yeah.  same problem.  mostly attacking across the whole board, or taking a neutral when I am already too weak.
2010-11-14T23:46:06  <sigh> interesting... I just treat enemy and neutral all in one go
2010-11-14T23:46:14  <bhasker> macca i order my list something like this
2010-11-14T23:46:19  <bhasker> MyPlanets
2010-11-14T23:46:21  <bhasker> EnemyPlanets
2010-11-14T23:46:29  <bhasker> almost the same for the two
2010-11-14T23:46:31  <bhasker> followed by
2010-11-14T23:46:36  <bhasker> Neutrals under attack by me or enemy
2010-11-14T23:46:40  <bhasker> followed by neutrals
2010-11-14T23:46:41  <antimatroid> mega strategy share session :)
2010-11-14T23:46:50  <TheMacca> heh
2010-11-14T23:47:02  <sigh> antimatroid: lies, mega is not here :(
2010-11-14T23:47:08  <antimatroid> hehe
2010-11-14T23:47:10  <TheMacca> bhasker: our stuff sounds pretty similar
2010-11-14T23:47:16  <bhasker> and i stop attacking a particular planet when i have sent enough ships to account for a) enemy growth he can send + enemy ships he can send next turn to that planet
2010-11-14T23:47:17  <TheMacca> which is weird, coz you keep besting me ;)
2010-11-14T23:47:23  <bhasker> before my attack from a particular planet can reach it
2010-11-14T23:47:46  <bhasker> actually i overestimate how much i can send to
2010-11-14T23:48:02  <antimatroid> bocsimacko's bot really doesn't like that mpa
2010-11-14T23:48:03  <bhasker> the attack is usually enough to take the planet i attacked and neighbouring planets

2010-11-14T23:48:15  <bhasker> the reason for sending a larger than required fleet
2010-11-14T23:48:23  <bhasker> was i would send ships and they would just take the planet and sit
2010-11-14T23:48:32  <bhasker> even though they could technically hit all 3planets nearby
2010-11-14T23:48:36  <bhasker> and capture them
2010-11-14T23:48:52  <bhasker> the reaosn being it would decide the # of ships it can send without losing the planet is zero
2010-11-14T23:48:57  <bhasker> so i send over the # required
2010-11-14T23:48:57  <sigh> bhasker: I do something similar
2010-11-14T23:49:08  <bhasker> so that it will attack immediately
2010-11-14T23:49:11  <bhasker> neighbouring planets
2010-11-14T23:49:21  <bhasker> also at end of turn i do some other stuff
2010-11-14T23:49:34  <bhasker> which is, i recalculate which planets will be mine given the current launches in progress
2010-11-14T23:49:39  <bhasker> and i launch any ships that i didn't send
2010-11-14T23:49:46  <bhasker> towwards those if they are closer to the enemy
2010-11-14T23:50:02  <TheMacca> heh - wow
2010-11-14T23:50:11  <bhasker> so my extra ships follow
2010-11-14T23:50:13  <TheMacca> strikingly similar
2010-11-14T23:50:13  <bhasker> my launches
2010-11-14T23:50:21  <bhasker> sometimes that can backfire
2010-11-14T23:50:31  <bhasker> so i have a lot of checks when not to launch
2010-11-14T23:50:44  <bhasker> like if a planet has an enemy planet closer than the target then it won't forward
2010-11-14T23:50:48  <bhasker> etc
2010-11-14T23:50:56  <bhasker> so not all planets will launch the extra ships
2010-11-14T23:53:07  <bhasker> also i have some checks on when to overlaunch for neutrals
2010-11-14T23:53:21  <bhasker> so i calculate if the enemy has planets nearer i adjust for how much enemy could potentially send
2010-11-14T23:53:34  <bhasker> so for some neutrals sometimes i would launch with 2x/3x the ships
2010-11-14T23:54:03  <TheMacca> I handle that the same way for neutrals as enemy
2010-11-14T23:54:12  <TheMacca> walk through projected futures
2010-11-14T23:54:24  <TheMacca> and assume enemy will reinforce / snipe
2010-11-14T23:54:28  <TheMacca> if they can reach in time
2010-11-14T23:54:37  <bhasker> the problem with treating neutrals as same as enemy was i would end up not attacking planets when i could have countered a snipe by enemy
2010-11-14T23:54:39  <TheMacca> (plus some slop - a couple turns or something)
2010-11-14T23:54:47  <bhasker> because i would overestimate the # of ships enemy can send
2010-11-14T23:54:48  <sigh> I just avoid sending to neutrals which can be sniped
2010-11-14T23:54:51  <bhasker> and decide i can't send
2010-11-14T23:55:08  <bhasker> so i do the overestimation only if attacks from both me and enemy are not in progress
2010-11-14T23:55:09  <bhasker> et
2010-11-14T23:55:14  <bhasker> once the attacks are happening
2010-11-14T23:55:19  <bhasker> i don't overestimate
2010-11-14T23:55:35  <bhasker> only the initial launch usually will over launch
2010-11-14T23:55:36  <bhasker> to neutrals
2010-11-14T23:56:11  <dmj111> bhasker: sorry to change the subject, but I am heading off to sleep... i can paste my state update code if you want to see it.  I am afraid it won't help much with your timing problems since your code handles a lot more than mine does.
2010-11-14T23:56:27  *** TheMacca <TheMacca!~Macca@adsl-75-27-235-203.dsl.irvnca.sbcglobal.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-11-14T23:56:27  <bhasker> hmm k thanks
2010-11-14T23:56:35  <bhasker> i will spend some time optimizing the code
2010-11-14T23:56:41  <bhasker> mostly because i want to be able to make moves undo them
2010-11-14T23:56:45  <bhasker> and evaluate the position
2010-11-14T23:56:50  <bhasker> to do that multiple times per turn
2010-11-14T23:56:54  <bhasker> i need a fast game state updating
2010-11-14T23:56:59  <bhasker> updation*
2010-11-14T23:57:10  <bhasker> the current code is too slow:-\
2010-11-14T23:57:18  <dmj111> yeah... I am doing that by copying the starting state, and just recalculating based on the new moves.
2010-11-14T23:57:36  <bhasker> i tried that, but i could never get the code to work correctly
2010-11-14T23:57:39  <bhasker> when i recalculate stuff
2010-11-14T23:57:43  <bhasker> and debugging it was a nightmare
2010-11-14T23:57:49  <bhasker> the state arrays are easy to debug
2010-11-14T23:57:53  <bhasker> i can just dump all the state
2010-11-14T23:57:58  <bhasker> and see if i had a bug
2010-11-14T23:58:00  <bhasker> or something

2010-11-14T23:58:42  <bhasker> oh nm he left
2010-11-14T23:58:46  <sigh> if you are just refactoring it is easy because you can compare against a working implementation
2010-11-14T23:59:30  <bhasker> yea i guess i could but i just find it easier to do this
2010-11-14T23:59:34  <bhasker> since i can just lookup the state
2010-11-14T23:59:38  <bhasker> easily at any turn
