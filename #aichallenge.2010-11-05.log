2010-11-05T00:00:17  <amstan> yeah.. it's the first one on the left
2010-11-05T00:00:55  <McLeopold> looks like a 7 9

2010-11-05T00:04:34  <amstan> hotel? hmm
2010-11-05T00:04:50  <McLeopold> so, it looked like a 7 9
2010-11-05T00:05:04  <amstan> yeah
2010-11-05T00:05:17  <McLeopold> if the numbers represent the corners of the cubes
2010-11-05T00:05:21  <amstan> so the fix is obvious, make the 7 an 8
2010-11-05T00:05:30  <McLeopold> yeah, visually

2010-11-05T00:06:52  <McLeopold> I supose you could find the lines where the number cross the boundaries, like a topo map.
2010-11-05T00:07:00  <McLeopold> Then start healing along those lines?

2010-11-05T00:09:11  <McLeopold> you might end up creating a node graph of the broken points
2010-11-05T00:09:44  <McLeopold> or, at least you could find sections that don't need fixes
2010-11-05T00:09:48  <McLeopold> and everything else does
2010-11-05T00:10:18  <amstan> well.. checking if it's good or not is simple
2010-11-05T00:10:48  <McLeopold> yes, just look at the 8 points around it?
2010-11-05T00:11:11  <McLeopold> but then the question will be, up or down?
2010-11-05T00:11:22  <amstan> can be either, up is good
2010-11-05T00:11:24  <amstan> lol
2010-11-05T00:11:46  <McLeopold> and if it spans more than one cube, you would have to expand to more points to get it to work
2010-11-05T00:12:07  <McLeopold> e.g.: 1,2,19,20
2010-11-05T00:12:10  *** perestrelka <perestrelka!~vlad@194.242.5.47> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2010-11-05T00:12:18  <McLeopold> -> 1,8,16,20
2010-11-05T00:12:46  <amstan> i'm thinking something that just goes one way, so you'll have some problems if you want symmetrical heightmaps
2010-11-05T00:12:51  <McLeopold> 1,2,27,28 -> 1,8,16,24?
2010-11-05T00:12:59  <amstan> if it finds an error, decrease the second point till it doesn't error
2010-11-05T00:13:36  <amstan> but that only works uphill.. hmm
2010-11-05T00:14:08  <McLeopold> change the lower of the 2 number being compared?
2010-11-05T00:14:44  <amstan> does this have to be recursive?
2010-11-05T00:14:46  <McLeopold> it seems like you have to raise the lower step up, so always find the number to increase

2010-11-05T00:16:07  <McLeopold> can you draw a picture where lowering a number is the solution?
2010-11-05T00:16:30  <McLeopold> oh, wait, I see it now
2010-11-05T00:16:52  <amstan> McLeopold: in that screenshot, 5th cube. delete that top part, lower the edge, then lower the edge of the 6th cube
2010-11-05T00:17:05  <McLeopold> yeah, it just saw it in my mind
2010-11-05T00:17:56  <amstan> so.. in the game, when a player has to do this manually, he can adjust the corner of all the 6 faces of each cube, so it's slightly easier
2010-11-05T00:18:18  <McLeopold> you lost me

2010-11-05T00:18:24  <amstan> nvm, forget that
2010-11-05T00:18:59  <McLeopold> so, for 2 invalid numbers, make the smallest adjustment
2010-11-05T00:19:19  <McLeopold> 6,9 -> 6,8 ... 7,10 -> 8,10

2010-11-05T00:19:41  <McLeopold> I'm assuming that would look the best
2010-11-05T00:19:48  <amstan> it would, yeah
2010-11-05T00:20:24  <McLeopold> after deciding the number to adjust, check the 8 points around it to see if it would cause more issues
2010-11-05T00:20:36  <McLeopold> if so, try adjusting the other number with the same check
2010-11-05T00:21:15  <amstan> ok, that seems like it would work
2010-11-05T00:21:25  <amstan> i just have to make sure it's fast now
2010-11-05T00:21:27  <McLeopold> I would probably try recursive
2010-11-05T00:21:41  <McLeopold> because your breaks will look like fault lines
2010-11-05T00:21:50  <McLeopold> and you can follow them that way
2010-11-05T00:22:33  <McLeopold> or maintain a matrix of visited and fixed points and a current location
2010-11-05T00:22:55  <McLeopold> hopefully toward the end of the run, you are just proving everything is correct and it gets faster
2010-11-05T00:23:01  <amstan> you think i'll get infinite loops?
2010-11-05T00:23:23  <McLeopold> if you mark visited points, you'll know
2010-11-05T00:23:25  <amstan> might happen if i keep adjusting for the smallest
2010-11-05T00:23:34  <amstan> ok, i see

2010-11-05T00:24:46  <McLeopold> but then, maybe a cliff would look good anyway
2010-11-05T00:24:54  <amstan> it won't..
2010-11-05T00:24:59  <amstan> because it's all cubes
2010-11-05T00:25:09  <amstan> let me get a screenshot of what happens now
2010-11-05T00:26:43  <McLeopold> I was gonna fix my bot, but now...
2010-11-05T00:26:55  <amstan> sorry, lol
2010-11-05T00:27:00  <amstan> i do have my answer i think
2010-11-05T00:27:18  <janzert> anyone with php or maybe http experience around that has an idea why api_get_submission.php will only send a partial tar file for some bots?
2010-11-05T00:27:25  <janzert> code can be seen at http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/www/api_get_submission.php
2010-11-05T00:28:59  <McLeopold> janzert: do you have a submission that is reproducable?
2010-11-05T00:29:10  <McLeopold> that get's chopped every time?
2010-11-05T00:29:31  <janzert> yes, any submission that get's chopped seems to get chopped every time
2010-11-05T00:29:42  <janzert> I'm assuming it is some binary sequence causing it
2010-11-05T00:29:50  <McLeopold> well, that's good.  Does it affect mega1, :)
2010-11-05T00:30:00  <janzert> even though all the documentation I find says that it should be binary safe
2010-11-05T00:30:03  <janzert> hehe, nope

2010-11-05T00:31:07  <janzert> I'm considering just having it try gzip, then bzip, then compress until it finds one a submission will transfer in :/
2010-11-05T00:31:29  <janzert> but that seems like quite an ugly workaround
2010-11-05T00:31:54  <McLeopold> is this getting from the user, or pushing to the sandbox for a match?
2010-11-05T00:32:17  <janzert> transfering to a worker instance for a match
2010-11-05T00:33:31  <sigh> janzert: is there a content-length header? maybe having one will help
2010-11-05T00:34:07  <janzert> I don't think so since it's streaming the content straight from the tar command

2010-11-05T00:34:59  <McLeopold> is it hanging and just not finishing?
2010-11-05T00:35:11  <McLeopold> or does continue with an incomplete file?
2010-11-05T00:35:13  <janzert> just receives a truncated file
2010-11-05T00:35:26  <janzert> yep, continues with the incomplete file
2010-11-05T00:35:42  <janzert> I added a check so at least it will throw an error now
2010-11-05T00:36:11  <McLeopold> safe mode?
2010-11-05T00:36:19  <janzert> I've heard of something similiar before with transparent proxies causing this sort of problem
2010-11-05T00:36:41  <janzert> but I wouldn't think there should be any of those between the main server and amazon Ec2 instances
2010-11-05T00:37:33  <McLeopold> exit code 0?
2010-11-05T00:38:04  <janzert> yeah, I haven't investigated the exit code yet
2010-11-05T00:38:17  <janzert> I do know running the exact command manually works fine
2010-11-05T00:38:47  <janzert> but maybe something about the environment when running under php is effecting it

2010-11-05T09:29:24  <bhasker_> hey antimatroid how are you calculating minimum ships you should send to a neutral to hold it
2010-11-05T09:29:37  <bhasker_> i have some heuristics but i don't think its correct
2010-11-05T09:34:24  <antimatroid1> i'm not doing that well, that's part of the reason i've removed any "finish time" for a move
2010-11-05T09:34:42  <antimatroid1> i am going to "fight for a planet" into the future, and only consider it a move if i intend to be able to hold it into the future
2010-11-05T09:34:47  <antimatroid1> i haven't fixed all that up yet
2010-11-05T09:35:01  <antimatroid1> i have more exams monday and tuesday, then i'll be working on my bot pretty much nonstop till the end

2010-11-05T11:37:50  <demerzel_> i remember my old bots which were pretty primitive comparatively could hold their own more or less now they get slaughtered every time
2010-11-05T11:38:25  <JamesMG> Yeah, my original bot sits close to -300ELO on there if I run it
2010-11-05T11:38:55  <JamesMG> or it did a week ago, probably closer to -400 now
2010-11-05T11:39:04  <demerzel_> haha i have been testing locally it's embarrasing
2010-11-05T11:41:44  <JamesMG> just run your bot as bocsimacko, confuse everybody

2010-11-05T11:45:25  <Naktibalda> you wish
2010-11-05T11:45:26  <JamesMG> so it can roll over and die or something
2010-11-05T11:45:34  <demerzel_> it will do that anyway
2010-11-05T11:45:35  <demerzel_> ;)
2010-11-05T11:45:41  <Naktibalda> it's forbidden by rules
2010-11-05T11:46:02  <JamesMG> oh well
2010-11-05T11:46:07  <demerzel_> i don't think there's any way to actually determine the opponent name during game

2010-11-05T11:48:38  <JamesMG> I think everything being in root folder should be fine

2010-11-05T15:48:27  <raedwulf> im was using c89 then i got bloody annoyed with declaring c at the start of blocks, so i went c99

2010-11-05T15:49:43  <raedwulf> not its c99 compatible
2010-11-05T15:49:52  <raedwulf> but not c89 strict
2010-11-05T15:50:02  <raedwulf> its just compatible with gnu89 and c99

2010-11-05T15:51:36  <raedwulf> yea
2010-11-05T15:51:42  <demerzel_> oh i actually like that it makes me think about it
2010-11-05T15:51:53  <raedwulf> thats not necessary in gnu89, but is necessary if you're strick ansi c 89
2010-11-05T15:51:57  <raedwulf> strict*
2010-11-05T15:52:04  <demerzel_> c89 is about as close to a natural language for the way my brain works as i've ever found ;)
2010-11-05T15:52:09  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-11-05T15:52:24  <demerzel_> or plays to my strengths at least
2010-11-05T15:52:28  <raedwulf> e.g. the msvc compiler won't like inline variable declarations
2010-11-05T15:52:30  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-11-05T15:52:32  <raedwulf> ah neat
2010-11-05T15:52:34  <Error323> holy crap

2010-11-05T15:52:43  <raedwulf> well i can show you my code after the contest, its pretty neat
2010-11-05T15:52:43  <demerzel_> why?
2010-11-05T15:52:49  <Error323> just had thai food that is HOOOOT
2010-11-05T15:53:00  <raedwulf> not necessarily going to work, mind
2010-11-05T15:53:01  <cfaftw> thai food is supposed to be hot

2010-11-05T15:53:20  <cfaftw> hottest food i ever ate was thai, actually
2010-11-05T15:53:22  <raedwulf> meh, Error323 you weakling
2010-11-05T15:53:30  <raedwulf> you are all weaklings :/

2010-11-05T15:54:20  <Error323> well i'm dutch, we don't know hot
2010-11-05T15:54:23  <cfaftw> which i don't get
2010-11-05T15:54:31  <cfaftw> why do spicy foods originate from places where the temperature is hot
2010-11-05T15:54:49  <demerzel_> they don't mind sweating while eating i guess
2010-11-05T15:54:50  <Error323> thats where the spices are grown?

2010-11-05T15:55:16  <raedwulf> yea, they need the climate to grow
2010-11-05T15:55:34  <raedwulf> i think its because they need more acidic soil or something
2010-11-05T15:55:36  <Error323> cfaftw: could you put your bot on tcp? :)
2010-11-05T15:55:36  <raedwulf> im not a farmer
2010-11-05T15:55:37  <cfaftw> well yeah i understand that... just you would think they would prefer foods that made them comfortable
2010-11-05T15:56:06  <raedwulf> cfaftw: no, spicy hot food is nice
2010-11-05T15:56:08  <Error323> mm well I guess its just about getting used to it
2010-11-05T15:56:15  <Error323> and then its nice indd
2010-11-05T15:56:21  <raedwulf> tbh, most asians don't understand cheese
2010-11-05T15:56:32  <cfaftw> error323, can't... about to leave work. plus... it is not worth playing against
2010-11-05T15:56:54  <Error323> mmm ok
2010-11-05T15:56:57  <Error323> pitty
2010-11-05T15:56:57  <raedwulf> milk is not often used either
2010-11-05T15:57:12  <raedwulf> but it depends on the region
2010-11-05T15:57:47  <raedwulf> but im different, im eurasian, so i have a habit of liking both food :)
2010-11-05T15:57:58  <cfaftw> demerzel_, i'm impressed by how few lines you claim writing in C... it really must be an extension of your natural language
2010-11-05T15:58:14  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-11-05T15:58:16  <demerzel_> i have always preferred working with arrays etc
2010-11-05T15:58:20  <demerzel_> i have no problem adjusting to it
2010-11-05T15:58:33  <raedwulf> C? its simple
2010-11-05T15:58:44  <raedwulf> but then this comes from a person who learnt assembly language before C :P
2010-11-05T15:58:54  <raedwulf> just to be different
2010-11-05T15:58:57  <Error323> how old are you? :P
2010-11-05T15:59:02  <raedwulf> 23
2010-11-05T15:59:07  <raedwulf> almost*
2010-11-05T15:59:21  <Error323> how old is everybody for that matter
2010-11-05T15:59:23  <raedwulf> less than a month to my birthday hehe :P
2010-11-05T15:59:23  <Error323> i see
2010-11-05T15:59:24  <cfaftw> haha... well i should probably redo my bot in C anyway just for the sake of using C again
2010-11-05T15:59:32  <Error323> lol
2010-11-05T15:59:38  <demerzel_> C is soothing to me
2010-11-05T15:59:45  <demerzel_> i have zero problems finding shit
2010-11-05T15:59:45  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-11-05T15:59:56  <demerzel_> if something goes wrong i know exactly why and where
2010-11-05T15:59:57  <raedwulf> yea, C's language is much simpler
2010-11-05T16:00:01  <cfaftw> true
2010-11-05T16:00:05  <Error323> i like my maps, vectors and algorithm libs
2010-11-05T16:00:19  <demerzel_> i was trying to do it the C++ "way"
2010-11-05T16:00:29  <demerzel_> but got too annoyed with scope issues and references etc
2010-11-05T16:00:40  <cfaftw> oh man... i'm almost sold about doing this in C
2010-11-05T16:00:54  <demerzel_> haha
2010-11-05T16:00:56  <raedwulf> C++ is nice, but tbh it could do with a make-over
2010-11-05T16:00:57  <Error323> cfaftw: why?
2010-11-05T16:00:59  <demerzel_> i don't understand the hate for it
2010-11-05T16:01:10  <cfaftw> Error323, because he's reminding me why i loved it
2010-11-05T16:01:13  <demerzel_> c++ could be nice but as it is now it's just extra shit mashed into c
2010-11-05T16:01:18  <demerzel_> i'd rather use C# than c++
2010-11-05T16:01:19  <raedwulf> exactly
2010-11-05T16:01:31  <raedwulf> actually i would like to use vala
2010-11-05T16:01:35  <raedwulf> for the extra perf :P
2010-11-05T16:01:43  <demerzel_> should code it in asm
2010-11-05T16:01:45  <demerzel_> haha
2010-11-05T16:01:50  <raedwulf> you can :)
2010-11-05T16:01:55  <raedwulf> inline assembly
2010-11-05T16:01:56  <demerzel_> i don't know asm
2010-11-05T16:02:09  <demerzel_> i am pretty close i guess but never needed to
2010-11-05T16:02:10  <cfaftw> i *especially* don't know inline assembly
2010-11-05T16:02:17  <raedwulf> but then you have to assume that the servers are running x86 or x86_64
2010-11-05T16:02:25  <demerzel_> yup
2010-11-05T16:02:30  <raedwulf> and write different paths for boths
2010-11-05T16:02:31  <demerzel_> that's why i'm not messing with bitmasks either
2010-11-05T16:02:32  <raedwulf> both*
2010-11-05T16:02:53  <raedwulf> bitmasks are ok
2010-11-05T16:02:59  <raedwulf> because we know the compiler at least
2010-11-05T16:03:15  <raedwulf> gcc will behave mostly the same on different platforms
2010-11-05T16:03:17  <demerzel_> i like c - it's exactly the level of abstraction you need to avoid the implementation details without stripping away the power to do whatever you want
2010-11-05T16:03:31  <Error323> 41 \o/
2010-11-05T16:03:34  <raedwulf> its unlikely they're running powerpcs, just to spite our endianness
2010-11-05T16:03:36  <Error323> and climbing :p
2010-11-05T16:04:03  <JamesMG> when I resubmitted my bugfixes it played me against someone in 2000th place
2010-11-05T16:04:10  <JamesMG> now I'm having to fight through everyone
2010-11-05T16:04:14  <demerzel_> did you lose
2010-11-05T16:04:14  <raedwulf> lol
2010-11-05T16:04:15  <demerzel_> was it me
2010-11-05T16:04:17  <Error323> yeah same here
2010-11-05T16:04:22  <demerzel_> oh i'm only down to 400 haha
2010-11-05T16:04:22  <JamesMG> no, I won at least
2010-11-05T16:04:35  <demerzel_> my month old C# bot
2010-11-05T16:04:42  <demerzel_> it's too bad it has a glaring bug it might have gone higher
2010-11-05T16:04:55  <JamesMG> I'm guessing my current bot up there will sit around 250-350
2010-11-05T16:05:08  <JamesMG> once it finishes climbing from where it is now
2010-11-05T16:05:28  <cfaftw> my month old crappy python bot is like 70 now... i still can't believe that it was ever in the top 10
2010-11-05T16:05:38  <Error323> imo you need about a 1000 games to get a good estimate
2010-11-05T16:06:00  <JamesMG> I've never had enough games without crashes to know what my officials ranks will be though
2010-11-05T16:06:09  <Error323> cfaftw: yeah i remember you were there, damn did the rest just got that much better?
2010-11-05T16:06:14  <cfaftw> i literally would laugh every time i saw it in the top 10
2010-11-05T16:06:31  <cfaftw> Error323, definitely

2010-11-05T16:11:52  <raedwulf> but remember you need to check if they work with gnu89

2010-11-05T17:36:23  <Xanthor[aw]> I see
2010-11-05T17:36:33  <Xanthor[aw]> anyone using the PHP starter package ?
2010-11-05T17:36:50  <Xanthor[aw]> I don't see in the code where it parses the map
2010-11-05T17:37:28  <Xanthor[aw]> oh, nevermind. I got it
2010-11-05T17:38:07  <JamesMG> wow raedwulf, that's quite a pattern
2010-11-05T17:38:16  <raedwulf> yea i haven't a clue why it does that
2010-11-05T17:38:23  <raedwulf> it shouldn't have attacked the enmy planet
2010-11-05T17:38:26  <raedwulf> so its a bug :P
2010-11-05T17:38:39  <lavalamp_> raedwulf: looks like you have some work to do
2010-11-05T17:38:39  <raedwulf> but it was pretty
2010-11-05T17:38:52  <raedwulf> it was just some random code i stuck into offense
2010-11-05T17:39:20  <raedwulf> anyway, im going for marks with *prettiness*
2010-11-05T17:39:24  <raedwulf> xD
2010-11-05T17:40:19  <lavalamp_> I can't understand your neutral choice...

2010-11-05T17:40:29  <lavalamp_> unless you've been studying my bot
2010-11-05T17:40:44  <raedwulf> errr
2010-11-05T17:40:47  <lavalamp_> but my bot at least takes the good planets before taking the crappy ones :)
2010-11-05T17:40:56  <raedwulf> its based off rand()
2010-11-05T17:40:58  <raedwulf> :)
2010-11-05T17:41:02  <lavalamp_> LOL
2010-11-05T17:41:10  <raedwulf> so yea, i haven't chosen anything atm for offense
2010-11-05T17:41:17  <raedwulf> thats why im surprised it won at all
2010-11-05T17:41:27  <raedwulf> its supposed to randomly select a neutral
2010-11-05T17:41:35  <raedwulf> but it attacked an enemy planet
2010-11-05T17:41:40  <raedwulf> i think i sent it the wrong index :P
2010-11-05T17:41:49  <raedwulf> oh i know why it did that
2010-11-05T17:41:55  <raedwulf> yea
2010-11-05T17:41:59  <raedwulf> its based off rand() :)
2010-11-05T17:42:02  <raedwulf> very much so
2010-11-05T17:42:03  <lavalamp_> I bet you only attack indices < 5
2010-11-05T17:42:15  <raedwulf> nope
2010-11-05T17:42:18  <lavalamp_> aw
2010-11-05T17:42:22  <raedwulf> its just a side effect
2010-11-05T17:42:42  <raedwulf> my bot is very non-deterministic :P
2010-11-05T17:43:35  <raedwulf> ok need to fix the formatting of my debugging functions

2010-11-05T17:46:48  <Error323> yeah, don't use java ^^
2010-11-05T17:46:55  <Error323> no, i'm sorry i don't
2010-11-05T17:48:57  <demerzel_> don't use java either
2010-11-05T17:49:07  <Xanthor[aw]> Error323 : sure, I'll be happy too. But how do you test locally then ?
2010-11-05T17:49:12  <Xanthor[aw]> are there other tools ?
2010-11-05T17:49:15  <demerzel_> that looks like a java install error tho
2010-11-05T17:49:25  <Error323> Xanthor[aw]: logfiles & tcp
2010-11-05T17:49:31  <demerzel_> thread main in java.lang.ClassFormatError is a base library
2010-11-05T17:49:45  <demerzel_> ie part of the jre install
2010-11-05T17:50:08  <demerzel_> i could be totally wrong tho lol
2010-11-05T17:50:36  <demerzel_> could be it doesn't like hte precompiled version of the class - in which case you can try to javac the source
2010-11-05T17:53:55  <Frontier> Xanthor[aw]: Do you mix class files generated by different Java Runtime?

2010-11-05T17:54:22  <Xanthor[aw]> Frontier : no
2010-11-05T17:54:31  <Frontier> Like Sun JDK and BlackDown JDK or something... hmm
2010-11-05T17:54:35  <Xanthor[aw]> just unzip them from the starter package
2010-11-05T17:55:02  <Frontier> so what command did you run?
2010-11-05T17:55:19  <Xanthor[aw]> java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" "java -jar example_bots/DualBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-11-05T17:55:53  <Frontier> ok... slowly... does "java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar" print the same error message?
2010-11-05T17:56:27  <Xanthor[aw]> yes : both
2010-11-05T17:56:41  <Xanthor[aw]> both "java -jar ..." command have the same stack
2010-11-05T17:57:26  <sigh> Xanthor[aw]: what version of java are you running?
2010-11-05T17:57:30  <demerzel_> here's your problem
2010-11-05T17:57:36  <Xanthor[aw]> java version "1.4.2"
2010-11-05T17:57:38  <demerzel_> [16:54] <Xanthor[aw]> just unzip them from the starter package
2010-11-05T17:57:41  <demerzel_> don't unzip them
2010-11-05T17:57:45  <demerzel_> leave them in the jar
2010-11-05T17:57:53  <sigh> Xanthor[aw]: yeah, I think that that's not new enough
2010-11-05T17:58:00  <sigh> I needed to use java 1.6
2010-11-05T17:58:04  <demerzel_> or do you still have the jar
2010-11-05T17:58:07  <Xanthor[aw]> no demerzel_ : I mean unziped from the Package.zip file !
2010-11-05T17:58:24  <demerzel_> oh ok i know winRAR associated itself to .jar for some reason
2010-11-05T17:58:26  <Xanthor[aw]> I see sigh. It's what I thought
2010-11-05T17:58:28  <demerzel_> and it is technically a zip ;)
2010-11-05T17:58:50  <demerzel_> sorry -- took me a little bit to understand java file structure
2010-11-05T17:59:12  <Xanthor[aw]> demerzel_ : "[..]libgcj.so[...]" <- I'm on GNU/Linux, no creepy winrar for me ;¬)
2010-11-05T17:59:14  <Frontier> Xanthor[aw]: What does "java -showversion" print?
2010-11-05T17:59:56  <Xanthor[aw]> Frontier : actually, an error. While java -version prints : java version "1.4.2" gij (GNU libgcj) version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-20)
2010-11-05T18:00:11  <Frontier> Aha!
2010-11-05T18:00:36  <Xanthor[aw]> ok, so it's the version. Thanks for your help guys
2010-11-05T18:01:12  <Frontier> So obviously the starter package is compiled for Java 5 or 6 and your GNU Java Runtime only supports older versions
2010-11-05T18:03:39  <Xanthor[aw]> Error323 : any pointers to explain how use your 'tcp technic' ?
2010-11-05T18:04:26  <Frontier> very easy: download tcp.c from the forums, compile it with gcc and run it appending your bot command to the command line
2010-11-05T18:05:08  <Frontier> You will be matched against others running their bot on the tcp server at the same time or (ragebot if none are found, i think)
