2010-09-10T00:00:18  <a1k0n> java is crashing my browser
2010-09-10T00:01:04  <a1k0n> i've never had such a terrible experience with java applets before
2010-09-10T00:01:53  <bss03> jmcarthur: For the 3-way battle algorithm, the repeated subtraction and elimination of the smaller fleet is equivalent to just grabbing the biggest two, and calculating results from there, right?
2010-09-10T00:02:02  <rwa> any eta on opening registration yet?
2010-09-10T00:02:28  <a1k0n> oh yeah, http://a1k0n.net/temp/PlayGame.jar and http://a1k0n.net/temp/ShowGame.jar
2010-09-10T00:02:34  <a1k0n> ^ fixed and optimized
2010-09-10T00:03:40  <tapwater> phreeza: are you A/B testing your bots? haha
2010-09-10T00:03:42  <ratatata> a1k0n: what fixes on ShowGame.jar?
2010-09-10T00:03:46  <jmcarthur> bss03: with the one interesting fact that if the top top are tied then the result is 0 but belongs to neutral
2010-09-10T00:03:52  <jmcarthur> *if the top two
2010-09-10T00:03:57  <j3camero> a1k0n what is up with review 77? Is it still valid?
2010-09-10T00:04:41  <a1k0n> hah, yeah, it is.  sorry for the confusion
2010-09-10T00:05:00  <a1k0n> review it as the diff between rev 220 and 229
2010-09-10T00:05:15  <a1k0n> i submitted a review and subsequently fixed some bugs
2010-09-10T00:05:45  <a1k0n> j3camero: which branch making changes to battle resolution did you merge?
2010-09-10T00:06:10  <a1k0n> afaik that branch is the only one which actually fixes these issues
2010-09-10T00:06:20  <a1k0n> unless you merged individual patches from the issue list
2010-09-10T00:06:56  <bss03> jmcarthur: Ownership does change in a tie, right?  I'm thinking of 3-way battle between players.  X owns the planet but loses, Y and Z tie for winner.
2010-09-10T00:07:18  <bss03> jmcarthur: In that case, planter remains property of X, right.  It doesn't revert to Neutral, right?
2010-09-10T00:07:31  <bss03> s/does/doesn't/ Blah!
2010-09-10T00:07:36  <amstan> j3camero: look VV
2010-09-10T00:07:40  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  great fixes for Playgame - super fast now !!!  and seems less buggy

2010-09-10T00:07:46  <contestbot> amstan: i02agsij vs cheese_bot: game played at 2010-09-09 20:16:29, on map 748, 123513 beat 123527. http://ai-contest.com/visualizer_canvas.php?game_id=4415956
2010-09-10T00:08:04  <a1k0n> Zaphus: it is indeed
2010-09-10T00:08:35  <a1k0n> i basically couldn't use the stock playgame.jar to do the all-bots-all-maps test
2010-09-10T00:08:42  <a1k0n> now it's.. much less painful
2010-09-10T00:09:06  <amstan> danielvf: do you use winner= and looser= ever?
2010-09-10T00:09:35  <a1k0n> j3camero: i'll attempt a trunk merge, see what conflicts
2010-09-10T00:09:44  <Zannick> i am looking at a diff now
2010-09-10T00:11:17  <pgpaskar_> amstan: you could modify game_info to get what you want from it
2010-09-10T00:11:22  <j3camero> a1k0n: thanks. I just noticed that the code review is old-ish. I wanted to get someone to merge trunk into that branch before trying to review it and merge it back.
2010-09-10T00:11:24  <pgpaskar_> the SQL query... you can look up the player name
2010-09-10T00:11:41  <pgpaskar_> perhaps add a new field
2010-09-10T00:11:54  <Zaphus> a1k0n: thats 5-10x faster, at a glance (probably much more, given that the bots themselves use lots of time) -  my 9hr all bots all maps test would now be done in under an hour
2010-09-10T00:12:22  <a1k0n> j3camero: is it save to svn merge trunk to it and then merge back?
2010-09-10T00:12:27  <a1k0n> ideally i'd git rebase
2010-09-10T00:12:37  <a1k0n> but i don't know if i can git-svn on this https google code stuff
2010-09-10T00:14:14  <Zannick> a1k0n: the function PovRepresentation appears like it uses StringBuilder in trunk, but string appending in your branch
2010-09-10T00:14:26  <Zannick> whereas everywhere else it's the opposite
2010-09-10T00:14:27  <a1k0n> which branch?
2010-09-10T00:14:37  <Zannick> the 61_64, etc.
2010-09-10T00:14:46  <a1k0n> i think j3camero merged the optimization to trunk and it wasn't in that branch
2010-09-10T00:14:53  <Zannick> ah
2010-09-10T00:14:57  <a1k0n> that's why it needs to be rebased
2010-09-10T00:16:03  <ratatata> 1st place is a time right now :)
2010-09-10T00:16:17  <a1k0n> hah!
2010-09-10T00:16:33  <jmcarthur> bss03: right, ownership doesn't change if the planet just ends up with 0 ships
2010-09-10T00:16:35  <a1k0n> my name is lexically first, i should be in 1st
2010-09-10T00:17:49  <ratatata> you were 1st before last change (albert moving up), albert is the most recent 1st
2010-09-10T00:18:00  <ratatata> maybe that is taken into account
2010-09-10T00:18:11  <j3camero> a1k0n: I think it's a good idea to bring the branch back into line with trunk before reviewing. Basically, you have to merge all the trunk-changes that have happened since the branch was created.
2010-09-10T00:18:12  <Zannick> no, the entire rankings are redone every time
2010-09-10T00:18:36  <a1k0n> yeah.  ugh.  i need git-svn
2010-09-10T00:18:52  <j3camero> haha maybe next time we should just use git.
2010-09-10T00:19:35  <Zannick> yes
2010-09-10T00:19:47  <Zannick> that way we can branch legitimately :P
2010-09-10T00:20:08  <j3camero> Sounds cool.
2010-09-10T00:20:33  <a1k0n> i guess svn works iff you can figure out exactly what revision range to merge

2010-09-10T00:21:27  <j3camero> svn is simpler in many cases. However, I think it's times like these (many people, many branches, many issues being fixed all at once) where git probably shines.
2010-09-10T00:21:51  <Zannick> yeah, the only time i used svn was when it was only me committing
2010-09-10T00:21:58  <a1k0n> yes, github would make it very easy to figure out what's going on in comparison
2010-09-10T00:22:16  <a1k0n> plus i make extensive use of 'git log' which is expensive as hell in svn
2010-09-10T00:22:31  <a1k0n> (and git rebase, which doesn't exist)

2010-09-10T00:31:51  <j3camero> jmcarthur: it seems to me the reported confidence intervals were really really wide at the end of Tron. They overlapped in a big way. I am wondering if this change would end up making the rankings more random.
2010-09-10T00:32:15  <jmcarthur> j3camero: a1k0n and i discussed that agreed that this is better for during the contest and we could look into changing it near the end
2010-09-10T00:32:22  <jmcarthur> if you agree
2010-09-10T00:32:49  <jmcarthur> j3camero: this will have positive ramifications on testing and on game scheduling, in the meantime
2010-09-10T00:33:06  <a1k0n> the main rationale is that we've seen people play 2 games, lose both of them to really highly ranked players, and then be ranked like 3rd
2010-09-10T00:33:20  <a1k0n> (with a ginormous confidence interval)
2010-09-10T00:33:34  <jmcarthur> well, it will effect game scheduling once the scheduler looks for similarly ranked players, that is

2010-09-10T00:35:18  <a1k0n> the new code review is just as broken as a result of the trunk merge

2010-09-10T00:36:33  <jmcarthur> i included games played for clarity
2010-09-10T00:36:48  <jmcarthur> the difference is not as drastic there as it would be in practice though
2010-09-10T00:36:58  <jmcarthur> but the drastic differences would only be for new bots :)

2010-09-10T00:39:31  <j3camero> My worry is that once 1000 people join, the confidence intervals may blow up. If 90% of the bots have less than 10 games, we don't know what will happen. If the rankings become too noisy, people will not get the nice ascending feedback they expect when they improve their bots. I am suspicious. This may be a good change for the top 5% of people, but the bottom 95% may be frustrated.

2010-09-10T00:43:55  <Zannick> it either timed out, crashed, or issued a bad order

2010-09-10T00:45:21  <jmcarthur> anyway, i just don't think it would be so bad if a majority of bots had huge confidence intervals. relative to each other it would still be nicer than simply going by the means
2010-09-10T00:45:45  <a1k0n> yeah, if they all had similarly huge confidence intervals it's a wash
2010-09-10T00:46:11  <a1k0n> but there's no question that if you get more games you get a higher score, and you have no control over the former
2010-09-10T00:46:16  <jmcarthur> we might want to consider normalizing the scores in some way if they look really bad, but i don't htink it's a big deal

2010-09-10T00:46:23  <j3camero> If the confidence interval shrinks as games are played, we would be ranking 90% of the bots based solely on how many games they had played. It's a risk.
2010-09-10T00:46:55  <a1k0n> yeah it penalizes submission, which was kind of what you strove to prevent last time
2010-09-10T00:47:17  <jmcarthur> heh, we could work the other way and add the '+' so everybody starts at the top :P
2010-09-10T00:47:23  <a1k0n> haha
2010-09-10T00:47:34  <a1k0n> that's kinda how it worked with the win:loss ratio

2010-09-10T00:48:26  <j3camero> a1k0n and jmcarthur: can we hold off on the adjusted elo scores until a few days into the contest? We can even try to produce a hidden leaderboard that displays the adjusted rankings, just to see how well it holds up under strain once a lot of users flood the contest. Ranking stability is so crucial to maintaining the interest of most players.
2010-09-10T00:48:33  <jmcarthur> bss03: then when you resubmit a bot it does it all over
2010-09-10T00:48:35  <a1k0n> j3camero: yes, you have much bigger fish to fry
2010-09-10T00:49:18  <mistabell> when does the contest go live? (is it already?)
2010-09-10T00:49:20  <jmcarthur> that's fine
2010-09-10T00:49:23  <Zaphus> Or, don't rate bots until they have completed X games
2010-09-10T00:49:31  <bss03> I think that's mainly because there so few people in the contest so far.
2010-09-10T00:49:47  <j3camero> I think it works well enough right now. Ranking stability is just too important to take a risk like this. Let's re-evaluate in a week or so, and this might very well turn out to be a great idea.
2010-09-10T00:50:04  <jmcarthur> bss03: no, it's because they can play a top ranked bot and then have a huge confidence interval even if they lose, which puts them near the top
2010-09-10T00:50:19  <bss03> Also, I'm familiar with a Elo-based system that limits the maximum motion per-match to like 8, so rankings tend to be more stable that way.
2010-09-10T00:50:22  <jmcarthur> ranking *stability* is precisely what this offers though
2010-09-10T00:50:23  <rwa> any sense how many games/hr the server can process?
2010-09-10T00:50:29  <a1k0n> if i can just hold onto #1 until the official contest opens, that'd be an awesome segue from the last one
2010-09-10T00:50:30  <jmcarthur> bss03: this isn't just Elo
2010-09-10T00:50:37  <jmcarthur> bss03: this is a bayesian estimate of Elo
2010-09-10T00:50:50  <Zaphus> bss03: a couple of days ago we had someone in 3rd place on the ladder, and they had played 3 games for 3 losses -= thats where it just feels broken
2010-09-10T00:51:16  <j3camero> rwa: I think we're getting like 60 games/hour right now. That is probably not going to be enough. We need more servers. I am pretty sure the leaderboard is going to fall to pieces once the masses start to join.
2010-09-10T00:51:31  <mistabell> I don't think people would mind if you had to play a few games before you made the scoreboard
2010-09-10T00:51:31  <a1k0n> on the official site it won't be as likely though; i believe last time it didn't even rank you until you had 10 games played
2010-09-10T00:51:41  <bss03> Still, it seems like you could so a modified Elo that limited your score to (InitialElo - gamesPlayed * 8, InitialElo + gamesPlayed * 8)
2010-09-10T00:51:46  <rwa> mistabell:  agree
2010-09-10T00:51:47  <Zannick> i've seen a couple of players with 2 games in under a minute
2010-09-10T00:52:18  <a1k0n> yeah but you have to count on people using their entire second of cpu time per move once things get under way
2010-09-10T00:52:31  <a1k0n> the engine can still be optimized, plenty of opportunity for that
2010-09-10T00:52:39  <jmcarthur> bss03: the patch i've made does something a little more principled than that
2010-09-10T00:52:42  <j3camero> We may have to lower the 1 second limit. Maybe make it 500ms or 200ms or something.
2010-09-10T00:52:54  <a1k0n> j3camero: how many servers exist?  the same 8-core xeon as last time?
2010-09-10T00:53:00  <Queue29> j3camero, 200ms and the jvm can't even start up
2010-09-10T00:53:03  <j3camero> Last time we got a huge boost in ranking stability by making the engine 10X faster.
2010-09-10T00:53:09  <a1k0n> Queue29: first move gets 3 seconds
2010-09-10T00:53:15  <jmcarthur> bss03: it gives you a score such that it's 95% sure that your actual elo score is at least as large
2010-09-10T00:53:19  <bss03> jmcarthur: Limiting the amount you can modify your rating per game doesn't seem unprincipled to me.
2010-09-10T00:53:45  <a1k0n> j3camero: dhartmei has an independently-developed C engine already for benzedrine.cx
2010-09-10T00:53:46  <jmcarthur> bss03: but that's just elo. we're talking about an estimate of elo based on fewer games than can actually be afforded on the server
2010-09-10T00:53:59  <a1k0n> we can just bring his engine into spec and use that for the contest evaluator
2010-09-10T00:54:01  <j3camero> a1k0n: is it somewhat secure?
2010-09-10T00:54:02  <Zannick> not quite
2010-09-10T00:54:07  <jmcarthur> *based on fewer games than would be necessary to nail down an actual elo score
2010-09-10T00:54:16  <a1k0n> j3camero: it's a publicly exposed server, i believe so but haven't reviewed
2010-09-10T00:54:25  <jmcarthur> i'm still wording this badly
2010-09-10T00:54:26  <Zannick> the engine waits 2 seconds before  giving turn 1 state to players
2010-09-10T00:54:34  <bss03> jmcarthur: Bah, just actually play the games.  You telling me Google does have some extra CPU time available?  :P

2010-09-10T00:54:55  <jmcarthur> bss03: bayeselo attempts to estimate the score you would have if you continued to play more games than you actually have
2010-09-10T00:55:00  <a1k0n> j3camero: correct.  but the engine is the engine.
2010-09-10T00:55:08  <a1k0n> and could be used on stdin/stdout, etc.

2010-09-10T00:55:25  <jmcarthur> bss03: and because it's estimating, it shoots up very large numbers before many games have been played
2010-09-10T00:55:43  <Zannick> ...bahaha
2010-09-10T00:55:44  <jmcarthur> bss03: so by lowering that number based on the confidence in it, we dampen its effects
2010-09-10T00:56:00  <jmcarthur> and we can actually do that such that the number is still meaningful in some way
2010-09-10T00:56:08  <amstan> how did contestbot speak?
2010-09-10T00:56:16  <Zannick> amstan: "google" at the start of a line
2010-09-10T00:56:22  <j3camero> a1k0n: okay we can look into that. If we can get a faster engine, I am all for it. I suspect that the lion's share of the cPU time is spent by client programs processing, not in the engine itself.
2010-09-10T00:56:28  <Zannick> google supybot
2010-09-10T00:56:29  <contestbot> http://supybot.com/
2010-09-10T00:56:30  <rwa> why not just require a legitimate sample size before assigning a rating to a player
2010-09-10T00:56:35  <jmcarthur> (meaning that we are 95% sure that the actual elo score is at least the reported score)
2010-09-10T00:56:36  <amstan> Zannick: i must disable that
2010-09-10T00:56:37  <a1k0n> j3camero: very likely
2010-09-10T00:56:45  <Zannick> amstan: yes, you should
2010-09-10T00:56:51  <jmcarthur> rwa: isn't that basically a less useful version of the same thing?
2010-09-10T00:56:52  <a1k0n> j3camero: though on the current crop of bots, it probably isn't necessarily true
2010-09-10T00:57:04  <a1k0n> j3camero: anyway, how many servers and what configuration?
2010-09-10T00:57:14  <rwa> I don't understand what's less useful about it
2010-09-10T00:57:21  <jmcarthur> rwa: it's the difference between being low in the ladder until you have more games and not appearing on the ladder at all until you have more games
2010-09-10T00:57:36  <jmcarthur> being low on the ladder can at least give you some information earlier

2010-09-10T00:58:38  <bss03> rwa: It just also has a large confidence interval.
2010-09-10T00:58:49  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: you're right
2010-09-10T00:58:56  <rwa> with some confidence that people feel isn't "too large" to give the spurious behavior you don't want to see
2010-09-10T00:59:04  <Zannick> j3camero: anything new on the improved tournament manager?
2010-09-10T00:59:30  <bss03> rwa: Now that jmcarthur has explained what I was missing a bit more, I think his approach seems sound.
2010-09-10T00:59:55  <millertime> i just want my bot to stop timing out :(
2010-09-10T01:00:04  <jmcarthur> rwa: but nobody will agree on what that level is. by snapping to the lower end of the confidence interval we eliminate all need to argue about where the threshold is while still enjoying its benefits
2010-09-10T01:00:08  <millertime> i wish i could debug line by line..
2010-09-10T01:00:12  <bss03> jmcarthur: After a few hundred games, the bayesianelo will basically be the elo score, right.  So, bots that have been around a few weeks will be very will set in the ratings.
2010-09-10T01:00:13  <millertime> or can i?
2010-09-10T01:00:25  <millertime> using python
2010-09-10T01:00:26  <jmcarthur> bss03: well, only if nobody resubmits
2010-09-10T01:00:37  <Zannick> no, the elo scores as they are only use the last 3 days
2010-09-10T01:00:39  <jmcarthur> bss03: *if those bots aren't replaced, i mean
2010-09-10T01:00:46  <jmcarthur> Zannick: oh?
2010-09-10T01:00:49  <jmcarthur> that's kind of lame
2010-09-10T01:00:53  <bss03> jmcarthur: Yeah, resumit means resetting the elo history.
2010-09-10T01:01:05  <rwa> what is your definition of "lower end"?
2010-09-10T01:01:08  <jmcarthur> bss03: but yeah, after enough games, the scores are the same as they would have been anyway

2010-09-10T01:01:53  <bss03> jmcarthur: Using that low-ish estimate (Your rating is likely [95%] above this) means you still get to climb the rating and feel the rush to make your bot better.
2010-09-10T01:02:06  <rwa> that's just another arbitrary choice
2010-09-10T01:02:11  <icefox> user registration open yet?
2010-09-10T01:02:13  <jmcarthur> eh sure

2010-09-10T01:02:49  <jmcarthur>  rwa an arbitrary choice that still leaves partial information available!

2010-09-10T01:05:59  <Zannick> did i miss any messages?
2010-09-10T01:06:22  <bss03> rwa: I think we are open to negotiating 95%, 61.8%, 99.999% -- probably whatever can be done fastest (and is > 50%) is better.
2010-09-10T01:06:42  <jmcarthur> it's written for 95% already
2010-09-10T01:06:55  <j3camero> When I watch the website traffic on Google Analytics, I can see a direct correlation between fixing issues and traffic. Whenever we had a big issue-fixing day during the Tron contest, traffic would bump up by about 20% the next day and stay up. It really makes a difference.
2010-09-10T01:07:14  <jmcarthur> j3camero: interesting
2010-09-10T01:07:48  <jmcarthur> well, it's *roughly* 95%. i'm not 100% sure what the confidence interval bayeselo is reporting, so i'm assuming it's 95% because that is typical
2010-09-10T01:08:13  <j3camero> So a day like this helps reduce user frustration greatly. Which means that hundreds of people who didnt know much about programming before now know a little bit. They bring that experience to their schools and their jobs. It really changes lives.

2010-09-10T01:21:04  <a1k0n> http://paste.lisp.org/display/114411
2010-09-10T01:21:07  <j3camero> thx
2010-09-10T01:21:12  <a1k0n> that's the diff between trunk and the branch
2010-09-10T01:22:35  <j3camero> a1k0n: okay reading...
2010-09-10T01:22:49  <bss03> Haha!  My bot is even worse than the example!  It won't send a fleet if the *other* player has a fleet out.
2010-09-10T01:23:08  <bss03> So, it sends it first fleet and never does anything else. LOL!
2010-09-10T01:24:18  <j3camero> a1k0n: have you tested the Java portions?
2010-09-10T01:24:43  <a1k0n> very well, yes
2010-09-10T01:25:28  <j3camero> a1k0n: okay. The Java portions looks stylistically great, so I'll consider those kosher. Have you done any testing on the Python engine changes?
2010-09-10T01:25:48  <j3camero> a1k0n: if not, I can test those carefully, but I am too tired to do it now. It will have to wait until tomorrow.
2010-09-10T01:25:55  <tapwater> are the ai-contest.com entrants going to get wiped before it officially opens?
2010-09-10T01:25:59  <a1k0n> j3camero: ok.  i have done no testing on the python code
2010-09-10T01:26:11  <j3camero> a1k0n: alright that's fine.
2010-09-10T01:26:17  <jmcarthur> did the elo scores on profile page get reverted?
2010-09-10T01:26:33  <Zaphus> j3camero:  How many hours until official launch of the competition ?
2010-09-10T01:26:49  <j3camero> a1k0n: would you call the current state of the contest decent enough to open to the public? If I threw on account creation and went AFK for 16 hours, would that be okay?
2010-09-10T01:26:53  <rwa> woohoo, batting 1.000
2010-09-10T01:27:56  <j3camero> a1k0n: I think it would be acceptable. It would suck less than the Tron contest when we first opened it.
2010-09-10T01:28:55  <millertime> rwa: what does it mean when i get the "Player 1 has timed out" and I have no file created..
2010-09-10T01:29:00  <a1k0n> j3camero: as long as it includes the java changes, yes
2010-09-10T01:29:07  <millertime> which, for me, is called debug.txt
2010-09-10T01:29:35  <a1k0n> we definitely need the initial starter pack engine to not be totally broken
2010-09-10T01:29:38  <rwa> millertime: do you play any turns before the timeout?
2010-09-10T01:29:41  <ratatata> millertime: either exceeded time limit per turn or failed to start..
2010-09-10T01:29:50  <a1k0n> and having fleets disappear without effect is pretty broken
2010-09-10T01:29:55  <millertime> rwa: dont think so
2010-09-10T01:30:24  <rwa> if you comment out your entire DoTurn() fn, does your bot run?
2010-09-10T01:30:31  <millertime> is that a syntax error in my code?
2010-09-10T01:30:52  <millertime> rwa: and not have a DoTurn() fn at all?
2010-09-10T01:30:54  <rwa> millertime: maybe.  I would try to get a no-op bot going first, then add stuff little by little
2010-09-10T01:31:22  <rwa> have the fn, just have it do nothing to start.  that will tell you if you've got something else causing you a problem or if its your bot code
2010-09-10T01:31:27  <j3camero> a1k0n: yes you are right. Distributing broken starter packages is dumb because it is impossible to recall the changes later.
2010-09-10T01:31:46  <a1k0n> yes, and you'll be fielding bug requests from now on
2010-09-10T01:32:17  <millertime> rwa: i figured it would require a valid turn to take place in order to not time out
2010-09-10T01:32:25  <j3camero> a1k0n: okay I will attempt to merge just the Java changes into trunk. Are all the Java changes located inside the planet_wars/viz directory?
2010-09-10T01:32:30  <rwa> millertime:  a valid turn is to issue no orders
2010-09-10T01:32:36  <millertime> right on
2010-09-10T01:32:48  <rwa> or I should say issuing no orders is a valid turn
2010-09-10T01:33:06  <Zaphus> j3camero:  would it be 'fun' to add the 3 best starter-package bots to the list of entrants, starterpack_rage, startpack_dual, starterpack_???   as a baseline for people ?
2010-09-10T01:33:10  <a1k0n> j3camero: yes
2010-09-10T01:33:29  <j3camero> a1k0n: okay I will give it a shot.
2010-09-10T01:33:30  <amstan> woot!, believe it or not, but this took 2 hours; http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/testjson/game_info.php?game_id=4161292
2010-09-10T01:33:48  <j3camero> Good show amstan! Sorry I was not of more help to you.
2010-09-10T01:34:06  <amstan> lots of factors made it impossible to somehow get sample data, lol
2010-09-10T01:34:56  <millertime> rwa: with nothing in DoTurn() except "return" i now get a ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
2010-09-10T01:35:01  <j3camero> Zaphus: yes go ahead and do that if you like!
2010-09-10T01:35:05  <amstan> j3camero: is sharing the activation_codes a security problem?
2010-09-10T01:35:25  <j3camero> amstan: yeah. Don't do that.

2010-09-10T01:35:42  <j3camero> amstan: I am not sure how, but let's not do that.
2010-09-10T01:36:16  <rwa> millertime:  maybe start with a fresh starter kit?  did you muck with some of the code somewhere outside of DoTurn?
2010-09-10T01:36:16  <a1k0n> j3camero: basically you can just take my paste.lisp.org diff, trim the python stuff out, and use patch
2010-09-10T01:36:23  <amstan> j3camero: i am sure many people in here are interested in sample sql
2010-09-10T01:36:24  <j3camero> amstan: anything that is personal data, or which you feel sketchy about, like activation codes or hashes of passwords. Remember that using the hashes you can sometimes get people's passwords.
2010-09-10T01:36:38  <ratatata> millertime: paste the command with which you start the game
2010-09-10T01:36:39  <Zaphus> j3camero:  do you want me to go and create three accounts then ?
2010-09-10T01:36:43  <amstan> j3camero: i took them all out
2010-09-10T01:37:29  <j3camero> Zaphus: yes go ahead and create three accounts. I will open 'er up.

2010-09-10T01:38:11  <millertime> rwa: scratch that last comment, cause just having Python try to run the bot file gives me indentation errors cause of the block-commenting.. so dumb..
2010-09-10T01:38:28  <millertime> i found a new way to find small bugs
2010-09-10T01:38:36  <millertime> "python MyBot.py"
2010-09-10T01:38:58  <amstan> yep, all safe: http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/sample.sql
2010-09-10T01:39:04  <j3camero> Zaphus: no, but you can use the trick where you do zaphus+a@gmail.com, zaphus+b@gmail.com, etc.
2010-09-10T01:39:10  <Zaphus> ok
2010-09-10T01:39:12  <amstan> contestbot: learn sampledb as http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/sample.sql
2010-09-10T01:39:12  <contestbot> amstan: The operation succeeded.

2010-09-10T01:58:19  <Zaphus> ok,    Starterpack_Rage   and Starterpack_Dual   are now uploaded.   Dont think there's much point doing the others, I found those two the strongest
2010-09-10T01:58:53  <millertime> can someone tell me if they see any major reason for this to cause my bot to time out? http://pastebin.com/jajSRRva
2010-09-10T01:58:58  <PurplePanda> is there a certain number of games to play before you appear on rankings.php?
2010-09-10T01:59:12  <amstan> PurplePanda: when did you upload your code?
2010-09-10T01:59:33  <PurplePanda> ~5 minutes and two games ago
2010-09-10T01:59:45  <amstan> PurplePanda: yeah.. just wait a little
2010-09-10T01:59:48  <Zaphus> millertime:  opening, writing, and closing files can cause a timeout - I even get that on a windows PC  occasionally
2010-09-10T01:59:54  <amstan> PurplePanda: the rankings are a cronjob
2010-09-10T02:00:00  <PurplePanda> ah
2010-09-10T02:00:25  <millertime> Zaphus: crap diddley.. should i only be doing so in main()?
2010-09-10T02:01:12  <Zaphus> millertime:  Honestly, try to write to a memory file or something and dump out at the end...   OR - get someone to modify playgame.java to allow you to ignore timeouts (or set them higher) for debugging purposes
2010-09-10T02:01:37  <antimatroid1> damn that was a long day
2010-09-10T02:02:17  <PurplePanda> also why is the non canvas visualizer default? is it better? only i don't have java here :-)
2010-09-10T02:02:52  <ratatata> Zaphus: no need to modify PlayGame, its second argument is ms/turn..
2010-09-10T02:03:11  <Zaphus> ratatata: really !   wow, shows how much I looked at it :-)
2010-09-10T02:03:21  <a1k0n> amstan: wow i got pwned by cheesebot
2010-09-10T02:03:30  <amstan> yep
2010-09-10T02:03:39  <Zaphus> it fooled me because I saw 1000 1000 and thought it was the number of turns twice
2010-09-10T02:03:47  <j3camero> Okay a1k0n I have pushed the new starter packages live.
2010-09-10T02:03:56  <j3camero> The contest is basically open now.
2010-09-10T02:04:04  <PurplePanda> has the python one changed?

2010-09-10T02:10:25  <ratatata> millertime: the problem in that code is not timeout.. the file open tag.. try  open('filename','a')
2010-09-10T02:10:35  <j3camero> antimatroid1: good idea. I will add a big number to the elo scores.
2010-09-10T02:11:39  <antimatroid1> done, we're officially "youwillfail" this time around

2010-09-10T02:27:30  <mistabell_> there's a fine balance between sending a bunch of ships to other planets and sending them in one direction
2010-09-10T02:27:31  <amstan> 3 min left
2010-09-10T02:27:50  <amstan> mistabell_: how?
2010-09-10T02:28:43  <a1k0n> hahah what the hell?
2010-09-10T02:28:56  <a1k0n> is someone adding 2000 to the ratings?  if so, how did that go in?
2010-09-10T02:28:58  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: all scores got scaled
2010-09-10T02:28:59  <amstan> a1k0n: it wouldn't be fun if you win again, lol
2010-09-10T02:29:05  <amstan> antimatroid1: did they?
2010-09-10T02:29:08  <antimatroid1> upwards, so all are above 0
2010-09-10T02:29:10  <mistabell_> @amstan, I wish I knew, haha

2010-09-10T02:29:45  <a1k0n> or did jeff just agree to do it?
2010-09-10T02:29:53  <antimatroid1> jeff did it just before
2010-09-10T02:29:55  <mistabell_> I think it looks better with higher numbers
2010-09-10T02:30:08  <mistabell_> haha
2010-09-10T02:30:10  <a1k0n> oh ok
2010-09-10T02:30:12  <a1k0n> word
2010-09-10T02:30:15  <antimatroid1> i don't think they needed to be that high, but it's not really important
2010-09-10T02:30:22  <antimatroid1> and i do think it's a good idea to have people above 0
2010-09-10T02:30:35  <amstan> antimatroid1: what's the diff?
2010-09-10T02:30:36  *** jaspervdj <jaspervdj!~jaspervdj@zeus.ugent.be> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-10T02:30:37  <Zaphus> the Elo scores should be brought down by about 1000, but it's not really that important.   you'd really have to suck to get 0 now :-)
2010-09-10T02:30:38  <a1k0n> anyway i have to say it's funny that the bot threw together tuesday night is so strong
2010-09-10T02:30:42  <antimatroid1> auesthetics for new comers :P
2010-09-10T02:30:56  <amstan> antimatroid1: at the tron one, i was in lead for 1 week before someone beat me
2010-09-10T02:30:59  <a1k0n> dmj's is already stronger

2010-09-10T02:39:16  <Zaphus> anyone clever enough to monitor the standings and generate a graph of number of live bots over the next 24 hours ?
2010-09-10T02:41:06  <antimatroid1> did something end up getting implemented for conflict resolutions yet? I have time to throw up a stickyable forum thread on the topic now
2010-09-10T02:41:21  <bss03> jaspervdj: It's late here (1AM).  I think the pull request I just sent it is last one for the night.
2010-09-10T02:41:59  <bss03> jaspervdj: Depending on how much time I have this weekend, I'll try and get all the example bots translated and send a pull request when that is done.
2010-09-10T02:42:33  <bss03> antimatroid1: We went with the solution proposed by jmcathur.
2010-09-10T02:43:19  <antimatroid1> bss03: which one was that?
2010-09-10T02:43:40  <bss03> antimatroid1: That's the n-way combat where fleets are combined based on owner, then one ship from each fleet is gradually eliminated.
2010-09-10T02:43:56  <bss03> I don't have a link to the forum thread right now, and the forum doesn't seem to like my browser. :(
2010-09-10T02:44:23  <amstan> contestbot: what botrepo
2010-09-10T02:44:23  <contestbot> amstan: botrepo could be http://github.com/amstan/contestbot.
2010-09-10T02:45:04  <amstan> contestbot: later tell danielvf i added some things to game_info.php so it's easy to determine winner: http://github.com/amstan/contestbot/blob/master/gameinfo.py

2010-09-10T02:45:54  <bss03> amstan: What starter package are you using?  It seems to be crashing, or timeing out or something.
2010-09-10T02:46:04  <amstan> bss03: idk
2010-09-10T02:46:06  <amstan> i think the cpp

2010-09-10T02:49:52  <jaspervdj> bss03: Getting all the example bots translated would be pretty cool
2010-09-10T02:50:15  <jaspervdj> bss03: I just moved from [Fleet] to IntMap Fleet BTW -- this might break some code :-/
2010-09-10T02:50:39  <Utkarsh> amstan, vikhyat do you know if ruby1.9 will be used or 1.8?
2010-09-10T02:50:53  <bss03> antimatroid1: Someone's already got a haskell implementation http://github.com/stephen-smith/ai-contest-2010/blob/simplify-engageMany/PlanetWars.hs -- function engageMany, lines 175-202
2010-09-10T02:50:54  <greghaynes> amstan: Has someone taken note of this: http://ai-contest.com/organization_profile.php?org_id=81 ?

2010-09-10T02:51:29  <greghaynes> noice
2010-09-10T02:51:45  <bss03> jaspervdj: That's fine.  I'll try and follow your lead and fix up my code if you make incompatible changes.
2010-09-10T02:52:14  <jaspervdj> bss03: Also, I've added `step` and `engageAll` functions
2010-09-10T02:52:22  <amstan> greghaynes: go reddit it: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/dbyuu/google_ai_challenge_planet_wars_is_now_open/
2010-09-10T02:52:44  <bss03> jaspervdj: grep0's repository was already using it for some things with fleets, so I feel pretty comfortable with it already.
2010-09-10T02:52:46  <a1k0n> shit i think we (meaning i) may have broken IO on the java engine (maybe only on windows?)
2010-09-10T02:52:54  <a1k0n> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=470&p=2641#p2636

2010-09-10T02:53:24  <amstan> a1k0n: oh well.. just remember it for tomorrow
2010-09-10T02:53:25  <bss03> jaspervdj: Yeah, I wrote you a mail sort of about step/engageAll.  grep0 has a bunch of code to do evaluation in his branch already.
2010-09-10T02:53:40  <jaspervdj> kk
2010-09-10T02:53:49  <jaspervdj> I'll try to merge it then
2010-09-10T02:54:01  <bss03> jaspervdj: So, you might think about merging instead of re-writing, but you step/engageAll does exactly match any of this current functions, maybe.
2010-09-10T02:54:13  <amstan> Utkarsh: k.. ruby ruby
2010-09-10T02:55:15  <a1k0n> hmm i didn't change any of the flushing stuff that was there
2010-09-10T02:55:19  <amstan> Utkarsh: ruby's not installed yet, as said on the forums, it will probably be the default that comes with ubuntu hardy
2010-09-10T02:55:38  <blkperl> apt-get install ruby :)
2010-09-10T02:55:44  <amstan> don't have sudo

2010-09-10T02:55:57  <blkperl> i was assuming you were in a root shell :)
2010-09-10T02:56:06  <bss03> jaspervdj: I already optimized his combat resolver for the 3-way condition and sent him a pull request.
2010-09-10T02:56:06  <blkperl> vikhyat: thaks
2010-09-10T02:56:10  <blkperl> vikhyat: thanks :)
2010-09-10T02:56:23  <vikhyat> amstan: apt-get install ruby1.9 would install ruby 1.9 on ubuntu hardy
2010-09-10T02:56:27  <bss03> jaspervdj: Am I repeating my email, yet? :P  I need sleep.
2010-09-10T02:57:01  <amstan> vikhyat: can you still execute it with "ruby"?
2010-09-10T02:57:17  <vikhyat> amstan: not sure, i'll have a look
2010-09-10T02:57:32  <jaspervdj> bss03: I'm going to study his combat resolver later

2010-09-10T03:46:15  <antimatroid1> if distance is one, your move essentially goes through straight away

2010-09-10T03:49:12  <rwa> I should probably work on the bot rather than just refresh the rankings page every 5 secs...

2010-09-10T03:57:20  <mtcbot> yes, i meant OCaml
2010-09-10T03:57:47  <mtcbot> there is already a line with build command in compile_anything.py -- does it mean something?
2010-09-10T03:58:25  <rwa> I don't know
2010-09-10T04:01:01  <antimatroid1> with the proposed conflict method, consider this example
2010-09-10T04:01:02  <antimatroid1> players both send 10 ships to neutral with 30 ships, am I right in saying the proposed method leaves neutral with 20?

2010-09-10T04:03:44  <Zaphus> whereas the GalCon game would have left Neutral with 10
2010-09-10T04:03:45  <antimatroid1> yes, that's why i'm playing with it, to start working on my bot properly

2010-09-10T04:14:08  <Zaphus> millertime:  are you doing pw.Distance() inside a loop ?   if so you could cache the results because they never change, then just return the actual value
2010-09-10T04:14:51  <millertime> yes its a for loop
2010-09-10T04:15:08  <millertime> dependent on the source planet though

2010-09-10T04:15:55  <millertime> ?
2010-09-10T04:16:03  <millertime> alrighty..
2010-09-10T04:16:07  <millertime> i can try that
2010-09-10T04:16:20  <antimatroid1> are you using c++?
2010-09-10T04:16:23  <millertime> python
2010-09-10T04:16:36  <antimatroid1> just use a 2-dimensional array
2010-09-10T04:16:44  <antimatroid1> or does python have my beloved vectors?
2010-09-10T04:16:59  <Zaphus> and if thats really slow, then do this:     if (cacheddist[x][y] < 0) get pw.Distance(), cache it and use it,   else use cached dist     and init them to -1 on program boot
2010-09-10T04:17:10  <Zaphus> that caches each one the first time you use it
2010-09-10T04:17:42  <millertime> ahhh not a bad idea

2010-09-10T04:21:05  <millertime> i simply cannot find a strat that gets me above %60
2010-09-10T04:21:20  <rwa> above 60% against what?
2010-09-10T04:21:26  <millertime> the example_bots
2010-09-10T04:21:49  <millertime> the more i have modified the bot, the worse it has gotten
2010-09-10T04:21:54  <Zaphus> the rage bot will probably do that well, except against itself
2010-09-10T04:22:14  <Zaphus> but, it's day #1  - you've got some time to think about it and try ideas :-)
2010-09-10T04:22:31  <millertime> i've been working on it a few days now

2010-09-10T04:22:57  <rwa> millertime: my suggestion is to spend some time playing Galcon and then think about what you're doing and why, if you haven't done that already
2010-09-10T04:23:02  <millertime> well.. not a few days solid.. just when i get time :P
2010-09-10T04:23:19  <Zaphus> it does help to play some galcon, watch the games your bot loses, and think about the mistake it makes

2010-09-10T04:24:55  <ratatata> a bit lazy to check manually.. does pw.Planets() return the list sorted in ascending order against planetIDs? or just random list?
2010-09-10T04:24:58  <rwa> yes you did
2010-09-10T04:25:21  <Zaphus> I've heard that millertime bot can't even beat the example bots... whats wrong with me ? :-(

2010-09-10T04:27:01  <rwa> my first idea has also been my best...
2010-09-10T04:27:31  <millertime> wasnt an idea, was the sample code lol
2010-09-10T04:27:58  <rwa> lol

2010-09-10T04:32:34  <Zaphus> I've just tried 5 variants on my magic numbers in my code, none made any difference (locally)... then I realised I was building release and testing the old debug version :-)

2010-09-10T05:41:52  <ratatata> PurplePanda: alright thanks.. I guess I'll wait for my bot to explode before I account for that :) for tournament purposes, its 1v1 I believe
2010-09-10T05:43:17  <antimatroid1> oh crud
2010-09-10T05:43:52  <antimatroid1> if a player moves from distance 1 away, on the next move this will be represented inside the planetwars object as having already landed wont it?
2010-09-10T05:44:12  <antimatroid1> so you can't just update your information based off other players new incoming fleets?
2010-09-10T05:47:53  <ratatata> antimatroid1: yes, I think that fleet will never enter pw.Fleets() [or maybe with 0 distance remaining? haven't checked].. but,  that information is quite insignificant
2010-09-10T05:48:11  <antimatroid1> ratatata: it is for how I was storing data
2010-09-10T05:49:33  <ratatata> antimatroid1: I would test on a custom map then
2010-09-10T05:49:38  <antimatroid1> well, updating how i store it anyway
2010-09-10T05:49:49  <antimatroid1> it wont be in fleets
2010-09-10T05:50:09  <antimatroid1> i wonder if people would be keen for defining distance as ceil(d) + 1 :P
2010-09-10T05:51:26  <ratatata> why the +1 ?
2010-09-10T05:51:41  <antimatroid1> so d = 1 can't happen :P
2010-09-10T05:51:56  <antimatroid1> well travel distance
2010-09-10T05:52:38  <ratatata> oh you mean people writing the engine :)
2010-09-10T05:54:27  <Palmik> I like how bots tend to ignore planets with 0 grow rate :)
2010-09-10T05:54:57  <antimatroid1> Palmik: unless it'd good for position, it's a waste of ships
2010-09-10T05:56:02  <antimatroid1> we are allowed to rewrite planetwars yeah?
2010-09-10T05:56:31  <Palmik> Usually, unless you want to store some of your ships on a safe place xD But they do not usually take it even if it would mean the would win... well, they win on 30th turn anyway, but
2010-09-10T05:57:28  <ratatata> antimatroid1: I believe so.. also you got me curious about the distance and I checked the source.. there is definitely a check for planets being too close.. but didn't look into it in depth
2010-09-10T05:58:11  <antimatroid1> the only real problem is if they're in exactly the same spot
2010-09-10T05:58:21  <antimatroid1> otherwise the ceil function shoots it straight to 1
2010-09-10T06:04:25  <greghaynes> Is there a 'setup time' in addition to the 1s turn time limit?
2010-09-10T06:07:40  <ratatata> greghaynes: 'setup time' ?
2010-09-10T06:09:15  <greghaynes> Does the 1s limit apply to the first turn also
2010-09-10T06:09:23  <ratatata> yes
2010-09-10T06:09:29  <greghaynes> hrmm
2010-09-10T06:10:05  <ratatata> bots can time out in 1st turn.. but there was a talk about it here.. so, might be suspect to change, dunno
2010-09-10T06:10:44  <greghaynes> That would open up some interesting options

2010-09-10T06:11:58  <ratatata> some suggested that, but now that I think of it, I don't think so.. it's highly dynamic.. I'm finding it hard to calculate something that is both static and process heavy

2010-09-10T07:10:15  <ratatata> using signed/unsigned makes practically no difference if you don't plan to go above index 2^^31.. I'd suggest using the cleaner and generic one

2010-09-10T09:00:41  <antimatroid1> i think maybe it was best to just sort f1 and f2 with argmax to start with
2010-09-10T09:00:51  <antimatroid1> then index that information, but otherwise i think the logic is fine
2010-09-10T09:02:13  <Zaphus> the maths looks right, although convoluted :-)    noNeutralShips confused me, I thought it meant No Neutral Ships   (i.e. 0)

2010-09-10T09:29:58  <Zaphus> thats what people are saying
2010-09-10T09:30:15  <antimatroid1> there's been ~140 bots for a couple of hours
2010-09-10T09:30:18  <Nuriaion> jep signups are broken
2010-09-10T09:30:30  <jmcarthur> that sucks!
2010-09-10T09:30:55  <jmcarthur> i assume we are reddited already?
2010-09-10T09:31:14  <jmcarthur> i actually don't see it on proggit
2010-09-10T09:31:24  <Zaphus> I'm about to post on Digg, since there's nothing there
2010-09-10T09:31:40  <jmcarthur> maybe we should wait for signups to work?
2010-09-10T09:31:40  <aerique> yeah, it's on reddit let me find the link
2010-09-10T09:31:44  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-10T09:31:55  <Zaphus> reddit link is in the title of this chatroom

2010-09-10T09:37:41  <jmcarthur> i'm not a fan of these artifically inflated scores
2010-09-10T09:37:47  <jmcarthur> i'd rather they be normalized instead
2010-09-10T09:38:05  <jmcarthur> say to a range of 0-1000 or something like that
2010-09-10T09:38:30  <Zaphus> they just need to subtract about 1000 and it will be approx correct
2010-09-10T09:38:33  <antimatroid1> yeah, i was just expecting > 0
2010-09-10T09:38:35  <jmcarthur> actually, 0-999 is nicer to be
2010-09-10T09:38:47  <antimatroid1> might have more than 1000 bots :P
2010-09-10T09:38:48  <Zaphus> no, if it's Elo you need to let it get over 1000
2010-09-10T09:39:05  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: elo is not a specific range
2010-09-10T09:39:15  <antimatroid1> yeah true

2010-09-10T09:40:00  <jmcarthur> i'm fine with the top bot getting better simply lowering everybody else's scores, personally
2010-09-10T09:40:27  <Zaphus> Zaphus:  not a range, but ratios - you will usually find there's a range of about 2000 in good Elo ranking systems, from ~400-~2700 - rarely over 3000 if ever
2010-09-10T09:40:56  <Zaphus> why did I write that to myself... must be getting late
2010-09-10T09:40:59  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-10T09:41:11  <jmcarthur> okay ratios then... that can be worked still
2010-09-10T09:41:37  <Zaphus> 400pts == 10:1 advantage, approximately
2010-09-10T09:42:17  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-09-10T09:43:01  <jmcarthur> is there a way we could just show the ratio relative to the highest bot? maybe express it as a percentage (0-100)?

2010-09-10T09:44:21  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: unfortunately i don't think that's the effect it would have
2010-09-10T09:44:31  <jmcarthur> we could just do percentiles if we wanted that
2010-09-10T09:44:34  <Zaphus> oh, well you could add that anyway - but I like the Elo score, gives me some feeling of 'score'
2010-09-10T09:44:36  <jmcarthur> which i think might also be nice
2010-09-10T09:44:41  <antimatroid1> no, elo is good for ranking
2010-09-10T09:44:55  <antimatroid1> but this then scales it
2010-09-10T09:45:00  <antimatroid1> it's an ordinal ranking
2010-09-10T09:45:15  <jmcarthur> this is really just bikeshedding, honestly
2010-09-10T09:45:16  <antimatroid1> so that doesn't matter
2010-09-10T09:45:24  <antimatroid1> what's wrong with that? :P
2010-09-10T09:45:27  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-10T09:45:41  <Zaphus> I have to bikeshed, none of my coding ideas are working :-)
2010-09-10T09:45:43  <jmcarthur> i can say with certainty that i don't like just adding 2000 willy nilly like this
2010-09-10T09:45:54  <antimatroid1> it makes no difference
2010-09-10T09:46:10  <jmcarthur> no practical difference, but it feels cheap
2010-09-10T09:46:13  <antimatroid1> but surely you would agree having all greater than 0 is slightly more ideal
2010-09-10T09:46:19  <jmcarthur> i agree with that
2010-09-10T09:46:21  <jmcarthur> *unless*
2010-09-10T09:46:34  <Zaphus> look at the other end of the ladder too - if you dropped everyone by 1000 it would be more in keeping with every other Elo score I've seen
2010-09-10T09:46:44  <jmcarthur> unless 0 is guaranteed to be the median
2010-09-10T09:46:52  <jmcarthur> i don't think it is

2010-09-10T09:47:40  <Zaphus> no, 0 probably isnt the median - although I actually have no idea what it is either
2010-09-10T09:47:43  <jmcarthur> i'd rather just not call it elo, especially since we don't even see confidence bounds on the estimate

2010-09-10T09:48:06  <jmcarthur> then we can normalize the score to whatever range we choose
2010-09-10T09:48:17  <coventry`> Fixing the scoring system seems like a micro-optimization, compared to fixing the registration process. :-)
2010-09-10T09:48:24  <jmcarthur> agreed
2010-09-10T09:48:25  <Zaphus> yep
2010-09-10T09:48:29  <jmcarthur> but none of us can do that, can we?
2010-09-10T09:48:30  <antimatroid1> we're speculating here
2010-09-10T09:48:35  <antimatroid1> we can't really speculate about that
2010-09-10T09:48:53  <coventry`> Oh, I didn't realize that.
2010-09-10T09:50:20  <jmcarthur> hmm, so it's a confirmation mail issue
2010-09-10T09:50:23  <Zaphus> By my reckoning, it's 9:45am in Waterloo, CA  - shouldnt someone be awake ?
2010-09-10T09:51:01  <antimatroid1> amstan j3camero?
2010-09-10T09:52:08  <jmreardon> however, the term hasn't started at Waterloo yet
2010-09-10T09:52:38  <antimatroid1> give them another few hours then
2010-09-10T09:53:01  <jmcarthur> they need a batsignal
2010-09-10T09:53:51  <jmcarthur> i think reddit's bugginess is preventing the submission from showing in the list
2010-09-10T09:53:59  <jmcarthur> i've had it happen to my own submissions before
2010-09-10T09:54:14  <jmcarthur> it doesn't even show under "new"
2010-09-10T09:54:14  <antimatroid1> i think too many people downvoted it
2010-09-10T09:54:21  <jmcarthur> it would still show
2010-09-10T09:54:22  <Zaphus> jmreardon: slackers
2010-09-10T09:54:45  <vikhyat> it probably got stuck in the spam filter

2010-09-10T09:57:46  <jmcarthur> oh woops
2010-09-10T09:58:03  <jmcarthur> i thought jmreardon was idle. didn't notice :)
2010-09-10T09:58:16  <jmcarthur> idle slacker :P
2010-09-10T09:58:38  <jmreardon> it's not actually listing me as idle, is it?
2010-09-10T09:58:53  <jmcarthur> nah
2010-09-10T09:58:57  <jmreardon> good
2010-09-10T09:59:52  <Zaphus> well, it's almost midnight here, I'm calling it a night.   I guess I'll hold off the Digg posting for now.   Next I need to actually figure out a strategy for the game, before I get knocked too far down the ladder.
2010-09-10T09:59:53  <jmcarthur> i'm considering a compromise between allowing binaries and not allowing binaries to ease j3camero's inhibitions about it. only allow binaries for approved users. requires adding a column to the database and a little extra code in the compiler script
2010-09-10T10:00:37  <jmcarthur> and maybe it could even show for one of the existing languages instead of being listed as Binary
2010-09-10T10:00:50  <jmcarthur> just a thought
2010-09-10T10:01:09  <Zaphus> Nice to see the "Starterpack_Dual" bot is holding its place at #41 out of 140  :-)
2010-09-10T10:01:13  <jmcarthur> wow
2010-09-10T10:02:16  <jmcarthur> it would be awesome to get the ratings.txt right now while most bots haven't played many games so i can see what their adjusted scored might look like
2010-09-10T10:02:28  <Zaphus> the two of them make a nice benchmark  (Startpack_Dual, Starterpack_Rage) - if you are below that mark then you need to look at those bots
2010-09-10T10:03:05  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-10T10:03:27  <Zaphus> Most bots I've looked at have played quite a few games (30+ I'd say)
2010-09-10T10:05:34  <Zaphus> Here's an idea... *if* you wanted a range of scores both above and below zero, then put the zero at one of the benchmark bots, either GalCon, or one of the starters :-)
2010-09-10T10:05:37  <antimatroid1> I don't think you can fairly allow some people to use binaries and not others
2010-09-10T10:06:36  <antimatroid1> how are people going with formulating strategies?
2010-09-10T10:06:54  <jmcarthur> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=99   anybody think of anything bad about this?
2010-09-10T10:06:58  <antimatroid1> i think i have a decent idea going, might be a while before it's uploadable though
2010-09-10T10:07:05  <jmcarthur> i could just go ahead and write a patch if not

2010-09-10T10:07:20  <jmcarthur> yeah mine is not uploadable for a while either
2010-09-10T10:07:38  <jmcarthur> especially if it's decided that binaries will not be allowed
2010-09-10T10:07:50  <jmcarthur> because then i will have to rewrite for ghc 6.8.2...
2010-09-10T10:08:05  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  re: ratings.txt  If you were going to make it accessable, why wouldnt you just make a webpage showing the info ?
2010-09-10T10:08:33  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: i've argued for more information on the rankings page too. i think people just don't want it to be noisy. i understand that
2010-09-10T10:09:03  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  Two pages then, have a link "Detailed Ratings" on teh default one
2010-09-10T10:09:08  <jmcarthur> wo could
2010-09-10T10:09:10  <jmcarthur> *we could
2010-09-10T10:09:41  <antimatroid1> there's 143 bots up now
2010-09-10T10:09:52  <Zaphus> ok, midnight, time for sleep.  hope the logins get sorted soon and the numbers keep going up !
2010-09-10T10:09:55  <jmcarthur> it would certainly be more work than just putting ratings.txt somewhere though

2010-09-10T10:23:22  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-10T10:23:50  <Palmik> those ridiculous numbers were because of my lame "select target planet" algorithm xD
2010-09-10T10:24:29  <jmcarthur> LOL
2010-09-10T10:24:32  <jmcarthur> that is awesome
2010-09-10T10:25:09  <jmcarthur> i like how this game is not very prone to draws
2010-09-10T10:27:16  <icefox> What about RageBot.jar on map 26?
2010-09-10T10:27:55  <Palmik> icefox, hmm... what is so specific about that map? (Sadly, i do know them from ym head xD)
2010-09-10T10:28:02  <jmcarthur> does it usually tie on that map?
2010-09-10T10:28:09  <jmcarthur> i only said "not prone to" :P
2010-09-10T10:28:09  <icefox> mine does
2010-09-10T10:28:18  <jmreardon> it beats mine current code fast

2010-09-10T10:28:40  <icefox> Either I get a draw or lose

2010-09-10T10:30:50  <jmcarthur> benzedrine actually has different values for + and -

2010-09-10T10:31:02  <jmcarthur> something is wrong
2010-09-10T10:31:03  <a1k0n> Palmik: it can host lots of games, since the contestants are the ones running their bots
2010-09-10T10:31:28  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: is the bayeselo output available on the site?
2010-09-10T10:31:36  <jmcarthur> not recently
2010-09-10T10:31:44  <Palmik> a1k0n, I know... but they comunicate through server, and before I did not see more then one game running, perhaps because of the low population
2010-09-10T10:31:50  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i have put up an issue to host ratings.txt publicly
2010-09-10T10:32:22  <jmcarthur> all i can do right now is compare http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=4MvZSfJw to http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getratings

2010-09-10T10:37:44  <a1k0n> i wonder about the asymmetry on benzedrine.cx
2010-09-10T10:38:21  <a1k0n> but i guess perfect symmetry is more suspect unless it's using a gaussian estimation
2010-09-10T10:38:44  <jmcarthur> i know for sure that the assymmetry is intended
2010-09-10T10:39:03  <a1k0n> does bayeselo do gibbs sampling or how does it work?
2010-09-10T10:39:05  <jmcarthur> for example, the top bot doesn't play bots better than it, so its + should probably be higher than its - after a while
2010-09-10T10:39:32  <jmcarthur> although it's actually the other way on benzen

2010-09-10T10:46:12  <a1k0n> well the code has a bunch of matrix stuff in it, so i'm guessing it's using the hessian

2010-09-10T11:07:16  <rwa> I have to say I don't like the visualizer where the motion is shown as continuous rather than in discrete steps as the game actually occurs.  Makes it harder to see what's going on/debug, etc.

2010-09-10T11:10:56  <contestbot> An error has occurred and has been logged. Please contact this bot's administrator for more information.
2010-09-10T11:11:21  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: i also have a habit of writing combinators that are designed to fuse well, and 6.8.2 just doesn't handle that well. i like to write for performance
2010-09-10T11:11:47  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Right, but that alone shouldn't preclude 6.8.2
2010-09-10T11:11:54  <jmcarthur> no, certainly not
2010-09-10T11:12:15  <jmcarthur> in the last one i just had all kinds of problems. things wouldn't build, etc. stuff that was stupid
2010-09-10T11:13:24  <ratatata> jmcarthur: when you say vector, do you mean list/scheme type vectors? (not java vectors I assume?)
2010-09-10T11:13:33  <ratatata> *lisp/scheme
2010-09-10T11:13:38  <jmcarthur> ratatata: i mean the "vector" package
2010-09-10T11:13:56  <jmcarthur> ratatata: i'm not sure of the difference between those vectors you mentioned
2010-09-10T11:14:23  <jmcarthur> there are list-like vectors and array-like vectors (and usually separately are things like linear algebra vectors)
2010-09-10T11:14:33  <jmcarthur> the vector package is array-like
2010-09-10T11:14:49  <ratatata> I don't know about the package.. scheme type vector is pretty much the same as an array.. O(n) access
2010-09-10T11:15:17  <jmcarthur> this is O(1) access
2010-09-10T11:15:28  <ratatata> java vector is a wrapper around an array with methods similar to list using array as internal storage.. afaik
2010-09-10T11:15:31  <jmcarthur> well, O(1) lookup, i should say
2010-09-10T11:15:40  <ratatata> jmcarthur: sorry... I meant O(1)
2010-09-10T11:16:23  <jmcarthur> ratatata: vector provides purely functional arrays but uses fancy fusion and stuff to avoid creating intermediate arrays
2010-09-10T11:16:36  <jmcarthur> ratatata: and actually uses mutation for a lot of things
2010-09-10T11:16:43  <jmcarthur> ratatata: it also provides some mutable arrays too
2010-09-10T11:17:01  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: So is vector strictly preferrable to any of the Data.Array.*?
2010-09-10T11:17:33  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: it lacks the ability to index on an arbitrary Ix i => i
2010-09-10T11:17:41  <jmcarthur> so not "strictly"
2010-09-10T11:18:00  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Ahhh, yes.
2010-09-10T11:18:04  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: but it provides a lot of nice functionality that you'd never get from Data.Array, like list-like functions and stuff
2010-09-10T11:18:51  <jmcarthur> they would be too inefficient with Data.Array because it would have to construct intermediate arrays all the time

2010-09-10T11:19:46  <jmcarthur> if the last contest is any indication
2010-09-10T11:20:08  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: array-heavy applications are one area where I typically still shy away from Haskell.  I need to bite the bullet and get some experience using the best-practices libraries.
2010-09-10T11:20:39  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: i tend to use vector or IntMap for most of those applications, for the record
2010-09-10T11:21:28  <jmcarthur> IntMap for when i need that free undo or for "sparse arrays"
2010-09-10T11:21:36  <jmcarthur> although sparse arrays can be emulated with arrays, too
2010-09-10T11:21:52  <mightybyte> Yeah
2010-09-10T11:22:12  <jmcarthur> IntMap was integral to my game tree search in the last contest
2010-09-10T11:22:36  <mightybyte> Ok
2010-09-10T11:22:59  <mightybyte> I probably should have done the last contest in Haskell just for the practice.
2010-09-10T11:23:18  <mightybyte> But I doubt I would have placed as high.
2010-09-10T11:23:21  <jmcarthur> you did pretty well with C++ didn't you?
2010-09-10T11:23:25  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-10T11:23:27  <mightybyte> Yeah
2010-09-10T11:23:29  <mightybyte> 10th
2010-09-10T11:23:37  <jmcarthur> i would have placed higher if i had just had the stinking time to finish
2010-09-10T11:23:41  <jmcarthur> but work got in the way
2010-09-10T11:23:57  <jmcarthur> the bot that made it into the final tournament was very incomplete :(
2010-09-10T11:24:47  <jmcarthur> my bot this year will be kind of efficiency-critical, so i really really want to avoid ghc 6.8.2
2010-09-10T11:24:56  <mightybyte> Ahhh.
2010-09-10T11:25:03  <jmcarthur> i'm currently building it with ghc head because it has some really nice inlining changes
2010-09-10T11:25:12  <mightybyte> I was thinking this contest is much less in need of peak efficiency.
2010-09-10T11:25:19  <jmcarthur> well, not for me :)
2010-09-10T11:25:21  <mega1> jmcarthur: how much better did you tron bot get after the competition?
2010-09-10T11:25:23  <mightybyte> heh
2010-09-10T11:25:28  <jmcarthur> (i'm not doing game tree search, btw)
2010-09-10T11:25:37  <mightybyte> Yeah, I didn't expect you were.
2010-09-10T11:25:48  <mega1> don't utter utc here, please
2010-09-10T11:25:53  <jmcarthur> mega1: i stopped working on it, but i think i could have placed in the top 30-50 easily, instead of being 105th
2010-09-10T11:26:02  <mightybyte> mega1: utc?
2010-09-10T11:26:08  <jmcarthur> i'm not doing utc :P
2010-09-10T11:26:15  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: UTC was my algorithm for tron
2010-09-10T11:26:15  <PurplePanda> I'm confused about how I get ranked 7th by loosing twice
2010-09-10T11:26:21  <mega1> uct
2010-09-10T11:26:26  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-10T11:26:28  <jmcarthur> uct yes
2010-09-10T11:26:31  <jmcarthur> you threw me off
2010-09-10T11:26:39  <mightybyte> Wait, what does that stand for again?
2010-09-10T11:26:57  <mega1> nothing, forget it
2010-09-10T11:27:14  <jmcarthur> upper confidence bounds applied to trees
2010-09-10T11:27:18  <antimatroid1> are registrations working?
2010-09-10T11:27:21  <mightybyte> Ahh, yes.
2010-09-10T11:27:22  <antimatroid1> there are 147 bots up

2010-09-10T11:28:40  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: basically monte carlo with a particular algorithm for focusing on paths that seem to do well without ignoring other possibilities. has some statistical properties that make it nice
2010-09-10T11:29:03  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Yeah, I remember now.  Just couldn't remember what uct stood for.
2010-09-10T11:29:23  <a1k0n> mega1: is that what you did for tron?
2010-09-10T11:29:58  <mega1> a1k0n: what I had in mind and also what I gave up on
2010-09-10T11:30:04  <a1k0n> heh
2010-09-10T11:30:14  <jmcarthur> i was making a number of improvements to the core of my algorithm regarding efficiency and some constants, and i was also going to adapt the uct algorithm to something more simulataneous-play friendly
2010-09-10T11:30:58  <jmcarthur> i had made some progress on all three fronts, but didn't get a chance to upload the last version of my bot, and i didn't really *finish* any of those goals

2010-09-10T11:32:50  <mega1> any opinions yet on whether planetwars is an interesting problem?
2010-09-10T11:33:23  <flaran> I feel like any problem that doesn't have a clear most efficient solution is interesting in a way
2010-09-10T11:33:24  <jmcarthur> so far i think it is

2010-09-10T11:34:32  <jmcarthur> at first i wasn't sure, but i'm convinced now that the game has enough going on that we can get some very interesting bots
2010-09-10T11:34:34  *** vikhyat <vikhyat!~vikhyat@117.195.128.207> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-10T11:34:52  <mega1> I hope to see some diversity in the algos.
2010-09-10T11:35:03  <jmcarthur> i think we will see a lot of diversity
2010-09-10T11:35:03  <mega1> I guess that can be a social problem.
2010-09-10T11:35:18  <jmcarthur> especially since there isn't an obviously best approach
2010-09-10T11:35:36  <mightybyte> I think there is potential for the top bots to converge on an optimal strategy, but by no means is that a forgone conclusion.
2010-09-10T11:35:40  <mega1> too much cross pollination and all that
2010-09-10T11:35:51  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: i think that is destined even for the most complex of problems
2010-09-10T11:36:10  <icefox> Well there is an obvious first approach
2010-09-10T11:36:11  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: but i think that would happen even if the strategy is very suboptimal
2010-09-10T11:36:17  <mightybyte> Of course, but I think it's within the realm of possibility to actually happen in this contest.
2010-09-10T11:36:50  <jmcarthur> i still don't believe that minimax was a great approach to tron
2010-09-10T11:36:56  <jmcarthur> yet all the top bots used it
2010-09-10T11:36:58  <flaran> well, that's assuming that we will find a single optimal strategy
2010-09-10T11:37:01  <mightybyte> ...which would not be the case for something like chess or dots-and-boxes.
2010-09-10T11:37:07  <jmcarthur> i guess i'm not one to talk since i didn't get to the top though
2010-09-10T11:37:21  <mightybyte> flaran: Yes, I did say "potential".
2010-09-10T11:37:43  <jmcarthur> i think what will happen is we will settle on a local maxima
2010-09-10T11:38:07  <mega1> I'm not sure how big the inherent randomness of the game is.
2010-09-10T11:38:12  <flaran> mightybyte: true, didn't catch that :) -- I have an odd feeling we'll see a good bit of variation though
2010-09-10T11:38:46  <jmcarthur> mega1: the engine should be deterministic, shouldn't it? or are you talking about whether good strategies will involve a lot of randomness?

2010-09-10T11:40:12  <mega1> is it like football (soccer) where there is a lot of randomness?
2010-09-10T11:40:47  <mega1> or is it more like basketball (which is a bit less so
2010-09-10T11:40:49  <mega1> )?

2010-09-10T11:43:01  <jmcarthur> but we don't have great bots yet
2010-09-10T11:43:12  <a1k0n> yeah, the bots are too dumb right now for any kind of consistent results
2010-09-10T11:43:13  <mega1> That was my impression.
2010-09-10T11:43:21  <flaran> I still can't sign up...
2010-09-10T11:43:39  <a1k0n> some bots utterly destroy others on certain maps, and get destroyed by the same bots on other maps
2010-09-10T11:43:39  <flaran> It seems registration is broken.
2010-09-10T11:43:49  <a1k0n> my bot actually prefers to be player 2 which is probably a bug

2010-09-10T12:13:05  <flaran> that makes a lot more sense now
2010-09-10T12:13:47  <jmcarthur> the early game is the most important, i think
2010-09-10T12:14:10  <jmcarthur> i'm inclined to think that 200 turns is okay for now, but once more bots get good we might have to lengthen it
2010-09-10T12:14:33  <jmcarthur> two good bots against each other will probably have a long early game
2010-09-10T12:14:53  <flaran> how are ties broken? is there a good link on how the process works on the judge-server end?
2010-09-10T12:15:03  <jmcarthur> flaran: they aren't broken. they are declared as draws
2010-09-10T12:15:19  <jmcarthur> flaran: you can look into bayeselo if you want to know how scoring works
2010-09-10T12:15:29  <jmcarthur> the backend just uses it
2010-09-10T12:16:58  <a1k0n> is anyone running ubuntu here?

2010-09-10T12:19:03  <mega1> jmcarthur: I see. It could show the current time as well on that graph.
2010-09-10T12:19:21  <jmcarthur> mega1: i think there is an effort to get a line to move through it as the game progresses
2010-09-10T12:20:09  <flaran> I just ran it and got identical results to the original two
2010-09-10T12:20:30  <jmcarthur> lemme try it on my arch machine. gotta download first
2010-09-10T12:20:42  <flaran> a1k0n: so maybe it has to do with someone's particular software setup?

2010-09-10T12:29:10  <coventry`> Where in the repo is the password?  "rgrep mailer_password ai-contest-read-only" returns nothing informative, for me.
2010-09-10T12:30:18  <a1k0n> it's in server_info.php
2010-09-10T12:31:58  <a1k0n> amstan: is this how emails were sent last time around?
2010-09-10T12:32:03  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i just built PlayGame from scratch and ran a script to run every bot against every other bot. player 2 won every time because player 1 timed out
2010-09-10T12:32:13  <amstan> a1k0n: properly.. with the sendmail system
2010-09-10T12:32:14  <jmcarthur> *every sample bot
2010-09-10T12:32:22  <amstan> a1k0n: but this is not *.csclub.uwaterloo.ca anymore

2010-09-10T12:32:54  <a1k0n> i'm guessing it's exceeding the rate gmail allows
2010-09-10T12:33:23  <a1k0n> hmm but now google is the mx for the domain

2010-09-10T12:34:10  <amstan> if this is a real server, why didn't he use a real sendmail server?
2010-09-10T12:34:11  <jmcarthur> j3camero needs to give you some flipping permissions
2010-09-10T12:34:20  <jmcarthur> and yeah, gmail is a strange way to do this
2010-09-10T12:34:40  <amstan> gmail i use on hypertriangle.com, because i'm residential isp and nothing else works
2010-09-10T12:35:54  <a1k0n> yeah, i think the contest site just sent too many emails via the smtp gateway
2010-09-10T12:36:05  <coventry`> Has anyone tried calling Jeff?  His phone number's on his CV.
2010-09-10T12:36:07  <a1k0n> you'll need your own sendmail/qmail/postfix MTA
2010-09-10T12:36:20  <a1k0n> and change the mx record for the domain

2010-09-10T13:02:28  <McLeopold> It looks like the tcp server awards a newly taken over neutral planet the production for that round, but the other server does not.
2010-09-10T13:04:56  <McLeopold> That goes for a take over of enemy planets as well.

2010-09-10T13:32:29  <coventry`> I think I know what must have happened with the mailing failure:  Suddenly, outgoing mail from that account spiked, and google's spam mitigation logic shut the account down.
2010-09-10T13:32:37  <amstan> coventry`: probably
2010-09-10T13:32:52  <amstan> coventry`: it's funny.. because we are google..
2010-09-10T13:33:01  <coventry`> Yeah, I was thinking that...

2010-09-10T13:53:51  <danielvf> Server bug?
2010-09-10T13:53:55  <amstan> can someone do a grep -R gmail.php . in the www folder in the repo?
2010-09-10T13:53:57  <a1k0n> some kind of hiccup
2010-09-10T13:54:06  <jmcarthur> i think we should just statically generate rankings pages whenever the elo script runs
2010-09-10T13:54:12  <jmcarthur> or at least the table part of it
2010-09-10T13:54:23  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: totally, or just memcache the page
2010-09-10T13:54:33  <jmcarthur> of course, we haven't profiled any of this, but that is the most logical optimization anyway
2010-09-10T13:54:48  <a1k0n> it's doing way too many table joins IMO
2010-09-10T13:54:56  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: well i assume that we can't cache the entire thing because the header should be different if you are logged in, but aside from that...

2010-09-10T13:55:09  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: ah, yeah.  well the table itself can be, yes
2010-09-10T13:56:01  <jmcarthur> rankings_widget.php should just read/write a flatfile as long as the file is not too old (assuming we don't go for a more industrial-strength general caching solution of some sort)
2010-09-10T13:56:07  <danielvf> Better yet, cache the whole thing, set that header from javascript
2010-09-10T13:56:15  <danielvf> Set a username cookie
2010-09-10T13:56:20  <a1k0n> yeah as long as the site is just one machine, a flatfile works
2010-09-10T13:56:24  <jmcarthur> danielvf: ooh yea
2010-09-10T13:56:29  <danielvf> and just have the page insert that
2010-09-10T13:56:41  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: well, rankings_widget might be used on the user pages too i suspect. didn't check
2010-09-10T13:56:43  <a1k0n> heh that's what we did for vendetta-online.com
2010-09-10T13:56:51  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: so the file might have to be names after the user id or something
2010-09-10T13:56:53  <amstan> @where issues
2010-09-10T13:56:53  <contestbot> amstan: issues = http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/list
2010-09-10T13:56:56  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: profile_games_widget is used there
2010-09-10T13:56:59  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-10T13:57:02  <jmcarthur> nevermind then :)
2010-09-10T13:57:11  <a1k0n> but i think that could also use caching to some extent
2010-09-10T13:57:22  <a1k0n> as people see a game, then back out to see more
2010-09-10T13:57:42  <a1k0n> that was a major annoyance last time how long it took to load my user page
2010-09-10T13:58:03  <danielvf> a1k0n: Yeah - should not be that way
2010-09-10T13:58:07  <jmcarthur> the main rankings page is the worst though, and since we know it won't change except when the script runs, it's probably best to just have the script update the flatfile

2010-09-10T14:21:29  <jmcarthur> how did this happen?     63R vs. 6B vs. 62N  ==> 6N
2010-09-10T14:21:33  <jmcarthur> what in the world is the rule right now?
2010-09-10T14:21:34  <a1k0n> dhartmei:  you have to merge all fleets from each party, find the top 2, and subtract and give the planet to the winner
2010-09-10T14:21:48  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: it just processes fleets in order
2010-09-10T14:22:02  <jmcarthur> i still don't see how it ended up with 6N there
2010-09-10T14:22:02  <a1k0n> wait that doesn't make sense
2010-09-10T14:22:26  <a1k0n> yeah 5 I could see
2010-09-10T14:22:27  <jmcarthur> turn 58 is the attack
2010-09-10T14:22:32  <dhartmei> in my current code, the players battle first, then the winner takes on the planet
2010-09-10T14:22:36  <jmcarthur> maybe i'm seeing the B wrong

2010-09-10T14:23:24  <a1k0n> how?
2010-09-10T14:23:44  <jmcarthur> oh i think this is 7B, not 6B
2010-09-10T14:23:46  <mightybyte> planet ship growth first, then doesn't reinforcement growth come next, and then battle last?
2010-09-10T14:23:49  <amstan> thank zepp: [14:18] <Zepp> i made it use the smtp server that is already running on that machine apparently :P
2010-09-10T14:23:52  <a1k0n> then that makes sense

2010-09-10T14:24:18  <jmcarthur> okay now i follow
2010-09-10T14:24:45  <jmcarthur> the viz really needs to make numbers easy to see on top of similar-colored planets

2010-09-10T14:28:34  <a1k0n> a flash game viewer might even be prefereable to canvas
2010-09-10T14:28:46  <a1k0n> (just for compatibility)
2010-09-10T14:29:07  <a1k0n> i could probably knock one out
2010-09-10T14:29:35  <a1k0n> ...using the js code
2010-09-10T14:29:36  <jmcarthur> i like canvas, but i guess it doesn't work for everybody
2010-09-10T14:30:05  <ulope> a1k0n: OTOH canvas works on most newish smartphone but flash doesn't
2010-09-10T14:30:17  <a1k0n> ulope: yeah, there's a case for both
2010-09-10T14:30:26  <a1k0n> hell opera mini even renders canvas which is amazing
2010-09-10T14:30:35  <a1k0n> (noninteractively, but still)
2010-09-10T14:30:48  <flaran> honestly, with this many developers, I'm sure someone will volunteer to make it for their favorite platform :P
2010-09-10T14:31:27  <jmcarthur> i've considered making a greasemonkey script just to replace visualizer.php with visualizer_canvas.php until it gets switched over all the way
2010-09-10T14:31:38  <a1k0n> yeah i'd rather use canvas than flash so i'll leave it for someone who really needs it
2010-09-10T14:31:43  <jmcarthur> but i don't even know how to use greasemonkey yet
2010-09-10T14:31:54  <a1k0n> it's not very hard but it's finicky
2010-09-10T14:31:59  <ulope> Why not just put in the existing canvas version and place a link below "Old crappy java version here"
2010-09-10T14:32:13  <amstan> ulope: idk
2010-09-10T14:32:34  <a1k0n> clicking a 'view game' link without editing the url first currently fucks up my browser
2010-09-10T14:32:44  <amstan> same
2010-09-10T14:32:50  <a1k0n> (safari)
2010-09-10T14:33:01  <amstan> my comp makes high pitched noises when the applet loads
2010-09-10T14:33:12  <amstan> then java proceeds to use 100% cpu even after i close it
2010-09-10T14:33:15  <a1k0n> i've had the browser frame actually freeze for good
2010-09-10T14:33:22  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't even normally have java installed except that this contest uses it
2010-09-10T14:33:39  <Zannick> that's a one line fix that should go in asap
2010-09-10T14:33:44  <krakrjak> It would be nice if you could use the canvas visualizer locally
2010-09-10T14:33:45  <amstan> woot: Most users ever online was 46 on Fri Sep 10, 2010 1:26 pm
2010-09-10T14:33:49  <Zannick> to change the link to _canvas
2010-09-10T14:33:52  <flaran> I don't have any Java hate in general, but applets are kind of useless.
2010-09-10T14:34:03  <amstan> that's even more than after the finals for tron
2010-09-10T14:34:15  <a1k0n> applets *could* be awesome, but there is just way too much overhea

2010-09-10T14:34:41  <Zannick> they were, several years ago
2010-09-10T14:34:44  <jmcarthur> the JVM is a remarkable piece of machinery... for anything noninteractive
2010-09-10T14:34:51  <dhartmei> re 3-way battle: what if the planet is neutral with 5 ships, and both players arrive with 5 each? top 2 prioritizes neutral?
2010-09-10T14:35:02  <jmcarthur> Java the language is okay for the time it was created
2010-09-10T14:35:14  <jmcarthur> dhartmei: 0N
2010-09-10T14:35:21  <dhartmei> ok
2010-09-10T14:35:51  <jmcarthur> dhartmei: if the top two are even the result is always 0N
2010-09-10T14:35:52  <a1k0n> yeah and reducing a planet pop to 0 doesn't change its owner
2010-09-10T14:36:01  <flaran> amstan: and a bad implementation
2010-09-10T14:36:05  <jmcarthur> right, but in a three way the owner must be N
2010-09-10T14:36:37  <jmcarthur> but yeah, if it's just 1v1 then a tie results in O<previous owner>
2010-09-10T14:36:47  <jmcarthur> or rather, in all cases
2010-09-10T14:37:39  <coventry`> Can someone send me the results of "uname -a", "cat /etc/issue" and "python --version" on the virtual machine in which the bots run?  I'd like to ensure that I'm building C extensions to the right target.

2010-09-10T14:42:25  <a1k0n> i wonder if it will keep the executable permissions if it untars with them
2010-09-10T14:42:32  <jmcarthur> coventry`: no, it doesn't do that
2010-09-10T14:42:51  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: shouldn't matter. it's just an object file that gets linked in
2010-09-10T14:43:08  <a1k0n> so's need to be executable to be dlopened
2010-09-10T14:43:14  <a1k0n> oh wait, no they don't
2010-09-10T14:43:21  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: the compile script sets permissions on MyBot.ext for scripting languages to 644, iirc
2010-09-10T14:43:27  <jmcarthur> that's it
2010-09-10T14:44:43  <jmcarthur> hmm... surely the sandbox doesn't allow launching new processes, right?

2010-09-10T14:44:52  <jmcarthur> i haven't checked for that specifically
2010-09-10T14:45:07  <jmcarthur> it shouldn't

2010-09-10T14:47:18  <amstan> wow
2010-09-10T14:47:23  <jmcarthur> we need that caching soon
2010-09-10T14:47:27  <a1k0n> are all these tables MyISAM?
2010-09-10T14:47:27  <jmcarthur> like... now
2010-09-10T14:47:40  <amstan> he needs to get a better server, this one is even worse than the tron one
2010-09-10T14:47:45  <jmcarthur> yeah and something is really wonky anyway if this is all it takes to overload the db
2010-09-10T14:47:45  <a1k0n> there's way too much locking going on i suspect if it can't even grab a game
2010-09-10T14:47:46  <tebele> hey
2010-09-10T14:47:57  <a1k0n> in fact games should just be stored as flat files
2010-09-10T14:48:07  <tebele> what changes are between the two different version of the starter pack? just the PlayGame.jar??
2010-09-10T14:48:13  <a1k0n> and just accessible without php
2010-09-10T14:48:16  <tebele> (to fix some bugs)
2010-09-10T14:48:23  <a1k0n> tebele: and ShowGame.jar, which is much faster
2010-09-10T14:48:26  <amstan> yep, all MyISAM
2010-09-10T14:48:28  <jmcarthur> of course now it works fine
2010-09-10T14:48:28  <tebele> great
2010-09-10T14:48:32  <a1k0n> and it added a missing C++ function

2010-09-10T14:53:13  <tebele> ha! ok, I'll test it
2010-09-10T14:53:20  <tebele> wait a second
2010-09-10T14:54:00  <tebele> no, it doesn't work. the same as before.
2010-09-10T14:54:08  <a1k0n> ok, i figured

2010-09-10T14:54:35  <a1k0n> Zannick: disappearing ships?  it should be fixed, maybe there's yet another problem
2010-09-10T14:54:48  <Zannick> that was the "remove that break statement" fix

2010-09-10T14:54:55  <Zannick> so i think it should be there
2010-09-10T14:55:02  <tebele> ok
2010-09-10T14:55:05  <a1k0n> oh, *that* fix wasn't pushed to trunk because it was supplanted by the new fleet resolution code

2010-09-10T15:00:34  <tebele> jmcarthur: we are player 1, aren't we?
2010-09-10T15:00:58  <jmcarthur> i mean whichever one you specify first in the command line
2010-09-10T15:01:12  <tebele> right
2010-09-10T15:01:38  <jmcarthur> P1 times out, so P2 wins

2010-09-10T15:05:12  <ratatata> a1k0n: http://pastebin.com/VCL83HzV  also: at the end of log.txt, I saw an unusual line following 'dropping player1'
2010-09-10T15:05:13  <Zannick> specifically lines like "player 1 > engine: "
2010-09-10T15:05:20  <a1k0n> this is the diff that broke it: http://paste.lisp.org/display/114426

2010-09-10T15:10:38  <McLeopold> I thought the 5 ships cancel and the 1 neutral remains?

2010-09-10T15:11:06  <Zannick> tebele: rank is only based on games played by most recent submission
2010-09-10T15:11:07  <jmcarthur> (1) Combine fleets. (2) Compare the top two (A and B). (3) If one is strictly greater than the other (say, A), winner is A with A-B ships. Otherwise, the previous owner of the planet retains ownership with 0 ships.
2010-09-10T15:11:10  <ratatata> a1k0n: I don't think I've sent a wrong command, the code that gets evaluated at that point is pretty much the same 10 turns before.. I will review anyway
2010-09-10T15:11:13  <jmcarthur> dhartmei: ^^

2010-09-10T15:11:42  <dhartmei> thanks
2010-09-10T15:11:59  <McLeopold> What if the neutral had 6 ships?  Is it reduced to 1?
2010-09-10T15:12:20  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: what if it's 5R, 5G, and 6N?
2010-09-10T15:12:26  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: the result is 1N in that case

2010-09-10T15:17:48  <dhartmei> correct?
2010-09-10T15:18:03  <tebele> jmcarthur: which is the formula?

2010-09-10T15:18:23  <jmcarthur> tebele: it's well-researched and actually means something though
2010-09-10T15:18:24  <tebele> that's right, no problem
2010-09-10T15:18:37  <tebele> it's a monkey typing random numbers

2010-09-10T15:19:09  <jmcarthur> dhartmei: umm... that seems about right
2010-09-10T15:19:26  <amstan> javagamer_Cpp: you would have it ^
2010-09-10T15:19:51  <jmcarthur> tebele: okay, some background: elo is supposed to be a number that denotes your "skill". it's usually determined after a lot of matches have been played.
2010-09-10T15:20:11  <jmcarthur> tebele: bayeselo attempts to guess what your elo is before you have played enough matches to be 100% sure
2010-09-10T15:20:53  <tebele> and why wtfbbq is 2nd with 6 games?
2010-09-10T15:20:57  <jmcarthur> tebele: E=1/(1+10^(D/400))    <-- D is the difference between two bots' scores. E is the expected result of the game
2010-09-10T15:21:08  <jmcarthur> tebele: because it's just guessing
2010-09-10T15:21:09  <tebele> we shouldn't be ranked until we've played enough matches
2010-09-10T15:21:21  <jmcarthur> tebele: i have proposed a change that would make people rise slowly through the ranks rather than jumping around
2010-09-10T15:21:27  <jmcarthur> while still eventually arriving at their elo score
2010-09-10T15:21:34  <tebele> sure
2010-09-10T15:21:39  <tebele> and what happened?
2010-09-10T15:22:35  <jmcarthur> tebele: my patch makes it such that you elo score has a 95% chance of being *higher* than the reported value
2010-09-10T15:22:59  <jmcarthur> tebele: the patch is pending while we get some more contestants so we can see what effect it will have before applying it
2010-09-10T15:23:12  <tebele> great
2010-09-10T15:23:32  <tebele> ah
2010-09-10T15:23:45  <jmcarthur> tebele: anyway, since the value reported by my patch only reports the lower end of the confidence interval, the result is that bots should gradually rise over time rather than jumping up too quick :)
2010-09-10T15:24:13  <tebele> at the moment of choosing the winner, the scores will be set to 0 to everyone so we all have the same opportunities?
2010-09-10T15:24:26  <jmcarthur> tebele: but either way, it's not just a monkey typing numbers. it's a very meaningful number. it's just not a very good guess at the number until more games are played
2010-09-10T15:24:44  <jmcarthur> yeah i think the final tournament will be from scratch
2010-09-10T15:24:47  <s_denchev> can someone tell me why this game is a draw ? http://ai-contest.com/visualizer_canvas.php?game_id=4429723

2010-09-10T15:25:01  <jmcarthur> huntsville, al, usa
2010-09-10T15:25:06  <s_denchev> seems that none of the bots played a move ?
2010-09-10T15:25:13  <tebele> Turn: 1 of 1
2010-09-10T15:25:18  <tebele> exactly
2010-09-10T15:25:22  <jmcarthur> s_denchev: then that's why it's a draw :P
2010-09-10T15:25:25  <tebele> or both timeout
2010-09-10T15:25:27  <jmcarthur> i bet they both errored out or something
2010-09-10T15:25:38  <s_denchev> yeah, but my both played just previous game
2010-09-10T15:26:00  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: sorry i can't really look at this code right now. i need to get some work done right now
2010-09-10T15:26:06  <jmcarthur> i'll get to it tonight

2010-09-10T15:26:49  <jmpespxoreax> perhaps a donation page to collect money for some iron
2010-09-10T15:27:19  <Doctor> Question: When you submit a .jar file, does it need the source or just the class files?
2010-09-10T15:27:21  <jmcarthur> i think there have been a couple volunteers willing to donate some CPU, too
2010-09-10T15:27:27  <jmcarthur> dunno if that will work or not
2010-09-10T15:27:30  <flaran> how can I test the amount of time my bot will take for one turn?
2010-09-10T15:27:41  <jmcarthur> Doctor: currently the server requires the source so it can build it itself
2010-09-10T15:27:42  <flaran> I remember someone mentioning a good way to do this earlier, but I did not save it
2010-09-10T15:27:46  <jmpespxoreax> that supposes that the tournament scheduler / engine has the capability to be modified to be distributed

2010-09-10T15:31:33  <rwallace> jmcarthur, entirely understandable!
2010-09-10T15:31:46  <Doctor> For Java, I assume the main class has to be "MyBot"?

2010-09-10T15:32:08  <tebele> Doctor, you have to upload the 4 classes

2010-09-10T15:34:48  <tebele> Hey all, my default visualizer is the old one, how to set the new one (visualizer_canvas) as the default?
2010-09-10T15:35:37  <rwallace> Doctor, that's a good question actually, I haven't had time to really try yet, but the best I've been able to think so far is dump stuff to a log file (since dumping stuff to standard error hangs)
2010-09-10T15:35:49  <dhartmei> please check 3-way battles on benzedrine.cx, the new code is in
2010-09-10T15:36:13  <rwallace> Of course being careful to disable the debugging code before submitting, since you're not allowed do any file writing on the server
2010-09-10T15:36:34  <jmcarthur> tebele: that would be a global setting that the maintainers have to do
2010-09-10T15:36:38  <rwallace> Probably the debugging code had better be guarded by a flag set only in your IDE
2010-09-10T15:36:41  <phreeza> tebele: i don't think you can right now
2010-09-10T15:36:41  <tebele> ok
2010-09-10T15:36:45  <dstufft> dhartmei: 3 way battles? i thought it was all 2ways?
2010-09-10T15:36:52  <jmcarthur> tebele: in the meantime you can just manually replace visualizer.php with visualizer_canvas.php

2010-09-10T15:38:07  <jmcarthur> since it uses canvas

2010-09-10T15:42:18  <tebele> bad luck
2010-09-10T15:42:22  <jmcarthur> tebele: i bet it actually placed you fairly high in the ranks though
2010-09-10T15:42:33  <jmcarthur> tebele: which is dumb, but that's how it works right now
2010-09-10T15:42:44  <mightybyte> Doctor: In long-running programs where bugs can take hours, days, or longer to occur, you'll typically set the debug flags to false and then write code to detect conditions closer to the bug and enable debugging.
2010-09-10T15:42:45  <tebele> what?
2010-09-10T15:42:52  <tebele> I didn't undertand u
2010-09-10T15:43:06  <jmcarthur> tebele: because the match didn't give much information, so the guess isn't going to be all that low
2010-09-10T15:43:12  <jmcarthur> because wtfbbq is the top player
2010-09-10T15:43:22  <jmcarthur> doesn't say much that your beaten by the top player
2010-09-10T15:43:26  <jmcarthur> *you're
2010-09-10T15:43:28  <tebele> aah sure. I'm 6 now
2010-09-10T15:43:42  <jmcarthur> tebele: yup
2010-09-10T15:43:51  <jmcarthur> that's how screwed up the ranking is right now :P
2010-09-10T15:44:06  <jmcarthur> three losses, 6th place
2010-09-10T15:44:18  <tebele> wow
2010-09-10T15:44:32  <tebele> in all the matches my bot crashed
2010-09-10T15:44:38  <tebele> I've to check it NOW
2010-09-10T15:44:43  <jmcarthur> hey, aside from that your bot isn't that bad :)
2010-09-10T15:44:52  <tebele> :$
2010-09-10T15:45:25  <mightybyte> Doctor: In situations like this where you upload your program to a machine you don't control, it can be even more difficult.  Typically you'll want to reproduce the problem locally.  This would mean downloading the game where your program crashed and using that to debug.
2010-09-10T15:46:01  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: heh that's ok, i'm in the same boat
2010-09-10T15:46:19  <a1k0n> hopefully someone can spot something in the diff i posted
2010-09-10T15:46:20  <jmcarthur> web apps are so boring..
2010-09-10T15:46:36  <jmcarthur> i studied it a little. nothing jumped out at me
2010-09-10T15:47:10  <mightybyte> Doctor: In situations where you can't even do that, you might have to fall back to debugging based on the model of your program that you hold in your head, and experience with common sources of bugs.  In these circumstances, debugging becomes much more of an art than a science.
2010-09-10T15:47:37  <mightybyte> Doctor: Is that a better answer? ;)
2010-09-10T15:49:31  <Doctor> I appreciate the information, but my Ph.D. is in CS and I've been programming for 34 years, so I knew most of it :-)
2010-09-10T15:49:57  <jmcarthur> :D
2010-09-10T15:50:03  <mightybyte> Doctor: lol, oops.
2010-09-10T15:50:22  <mightybyte> What were you hoping for?
2010-09-10T15:50:37  <jmcarthur> i think Doctor was hoping for a more pleasing answer, not a more detailed one :)
2010-09-10T15:50:54  <jmcarthur> like whether there was a good way to debug crap on the server and stuff
2010-09-10T15:51:39  <Doctor> Yes, something along those lines.  But I can do log files if necessary.
2010-09-10T15:51:46  <mightybyte> Are we allowed to open network sockets?
2010-09-10T15:51:57  <jmcarthur> no
2010-09-10T15:52:00  <mightybyte> You might be able to get more direct info from the server that way.
2010-09-10T15:52:03  <mightybyte> Aww, too bad.
2010-09-10T15:52:25  <jmcarthur> Doctor: the server won't allow you to write a log file though, so the source you upload shouldn't do it, at least not without a #define or env variable
2010-09-10T15:52:26  <a1k0n> you're technically not allowed to open log files on the contest server either
2010-09-10T15:52:37  <a1k0n> and stderr gets eaten, which is irritating
2010-09-10T15:52:49  <mightybyte> Yeah, it's difficult.
2010-09-10T15:52:55  <jmcarthur> i do wish stderr would be given to you through the web page or something
2010-09-10T15:53:14  <a1k0n> that would be cool but abused
2010-09-10T15:53:19  <jmcarthur> probably :\
2010-09-10T15:53:27  <jmcarthur> how about the first 10 lines of stderr :D
2010-09-10T15:53:31  <a1k0n> you'd get 80 gigs of peoples logs filling up the disk in no time
2010-09-10T15:53:40  <a1k0n> heh, that might work
2010-09-10T15:53:42  <Zannick> i submitted a patch to have game_info tell why your bot lost if it timed out or made a bad order
2010-09-10T15:53:46  <jmcarthur> well. that first 10 lines of 80 columns
2010-09-10T15:53:46  <ermau> I think you'd have to worry more about stripping out URLs
2010-09-10T15:54:10  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: make it a round 1000 characters
2010-09-10T15:54:10  <jmcarthur> Zannick: that's a start
2010-09-10T15:54:16  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: yeah
2010-09-10T15:54:18  <mightybyte> This of course, is a good argument for contestants running their programs locally like on dhartmei's server.
2010-09-10T15:54:22  <Zannick> i can't do much more than that
2010-09-10T15:54:37  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: yeah, but sometimes things just happen on the server and you can't duplicate it
2010-09-10T15:54:38  <a1k0n> yeah, the problem is what you do when it doesn't work on the contest server but works on your own machine
2010-09-10T15:54:43  <mightybyte> Right
2010-09-10T15:54:52  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: i had that issue a lot in the last one, mainly due to ghc version issues
2010-09-10T15:54:59  <mightybyte> Like compiling and package versions.
2010-09-10T15:55:13  <jmcarthur> i couldn't get 6.8.2 to build locally, and i could get 6.10 or 6.12 to build on the server :(
2010-09-10T15:55:18  <jmcarthur> *couldn't
2010-09-10T15:55:23  <Zannick> at the very least the jar files should put the error in another log file
2010-09-10T15:56:58  <mightybyte> Hmmm, looks like the ranking page is down again.
2010-09-10T15:59:04  <jmcarthur> wtfbbq dropped to 4th now at least
2010-09-10T15:59:16  <a1k0n> wtfbbq is pretty good
2010-09-10T15:59:46  <tebele> CAN I send more than one pw.IssueOrder() in a turn?

2010-09-10T16:13:08  <Zannick> yeah, looks like the tie isn't leaving the planet in control of its owner as it should

2010-09-10T16:15:37  <Zannick> nice
2010-09-10T16:15:54  <a1k0n> the news.yc and reddit stories didn't get any traction
2010-09-10T16:16:35  <Zannick> galcon is not quite tron
2010-09-10T16:17:22  <a1k0n> yeah it doesn't have the 80s nostalgia effect
2010-09-10T16:17:27  <madsy> Aha.. My viewer crashes because I assumed all the planets are updated per turn. Why is this not the case?
2010-09-10T16:17:32  <Guest77645> i found it in the planet python rss feed...
2010-09-10T16:17:47  <madsy> When is a planet updates in the demo format?
2010-09-10T16:17:51  <madsy> updated*
2010-09-10T16:17:56  <a1k0n> clearly it should be called 'the last starfighter challenge'
2010-09-10T16:18:24  <a1k0n> next one will be optimizing rubik's cubes
2010-09-10T16:19:00  <a1k0n> madsy: wut?  planets are updated each turn
2010-09-10T16:19:20  <a1k0n> first they grow by their growth if they're owned, then the incoming fleets are resolved
2010-09-10T16:19:52  <madsy> a1k0n: I managed to generate a match here where some planets are missing.
2010-09-10T16:20:31  <Zannick> that's disturbing
2010-09-10T16:21:04  <Zannick> i love how we fix one bug and introduce two more

2010-09-10T16:23:06  <rwallace> kirkeby, but the question is, after we have fixed infinitely many bugs, is the remaining bug count infinity or zero? :-)
2010-09-10T16:23:10  <madsy> a1k0n: Nevermind, I had a brainfart
2010-09-10T16:23:23  <jmcarthur> i would be a lot more productive if the rankings updated less frequently

2010-09-10T16:25:32  <jmcarthur> tebele: look at the numbers
2010-09-10T16:25:36  <Palmik> fleets of size 0?
2010-09-10T16:25:40  <Palmik> :)
2010-09-10T16:25:43  <jmcarthur> yup
2010-09-10T16:26:27  <tebele> in my code
2010-09-10T16:26:30  <tebele> in my bot
2010-09-10T16:26:33  <Palmik> decoy!
2010-09-10T16:26:38  <tebele> it crashes, and i don't know why
2010-09-10T16:26:49  <jmcarthur> god that match slows my browser a little
2010-09-10T16:27:07  <jmcarthur> tebele: find it hurry the world is depending on you
2010-09-10T16:27:09  <drewrobb> it would be interesting to try and find cases where optimal play involves taking defended planets with no growth rate

2010-09-10T16:27:14  <Zannick> lol both bots just left a neutral planet with 0 for most of the game
2010-09-10T16:27:30  <Palmik> wow, there is even grow rate graph
2010-09-10T16:27:34  <jmcarthur> yup
2010-09-10T16:27:42  <jmcarthur> except it's totals, not rate
2010-09-10T16:27:47  <Palmik> I see
2010-09-10T16:28:17  <jmcarthur> there are so many fleets in that match :
2010-09-10T16:28:17  <bss03> rate = d(total) / dt, so it's more information!
2010-09-10T16:28:19  <jmcarthur> :o
2010-09-10T16:28:41  <jmcarthur> total is more information than rate
2010-09-10T16:28:50  <jmcarthur> total = integral(rate) + C
2010-09-10T16:28:53  <kirkeby> rwallace: A countable infinity I would think. But that's not based on math, just on my experience with my own code :P
2010-09-10T16:28:55  <jmcarthur> the + C is extra info :)
2010-09-10T16:29:14  <Palmik> anyway... will that be introduced and benzedrine? :)
2010-09-10T16:29:14  <phreeza> jmcarthur: but we know C
2010-09-10T16:29:20  <Zannick> but we know what C is :)
2010-09-10T16:29:36  <jmcarthur> Zannick: it's only given if you look back at the first turn
2010-09-10T16:29:37  <bss03> jmcaruther: I guess my meaning was ambiguous.
2010-09-10T16:29:50  <Zannick> jmcarthur: always 100 :P
2010-09-10T16:29:53  <bss03> jmcaruther: I guess my meaning was I meant the current graph is more information than a rate graph.
2010-09-10T16:30:08  <dhartmei> nice, win in 13 turns: http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284150211|drewrobb0.2|dhartmei
2010-09-10T16:30:26  <Zannick> that is invalid
2010-09-10T16:30:52  <Zannick> that should not be a win on that turn
2010-09-10T16:30:57  <Palmik> it was crash
2010-09-10T16:31:09  <drewrobb> my bot has bugs
2010-09-10T16:31:10  <Palmik> of some sort
2010-09-10T16:31:35  <Zannick> oh potentially red launched ships when he didn't have planets
2010-09-10T16:31:37  <dhartmei> ah, yes, i missed the 7
2010-09-10T16:32:00  <Zannick> also the 10, and the 11 and 19 and the two fives
2010-09-10T16:32:16  <jmcarthur> @later tell Mathnerd314 you broke it! (look at the middle) http://ai-contest.com/visualizer_canvas.php?game_id=4428792
2010-09-10T16:32:16  <contestbot> jmcarthur: The operation succeeded.
2010-09-10T16:32:22  <JensT1> no, if the growth gets added first the seven disapears
2010-09-10T16:32:26  <JensT1> the planet disapears
2010-09-10T16:33:01  <dhartmei> right!
2010-09-10T16:33:04  <dhartmei> it's a win :P
2010-09-10T16:33:09  <JensT1> but yeah, the 5 and 5 would give ships to that place, and if then blue would just abandon a planet, it could be back overtaken
2010-09-10T16:33:11  <JensT1> so not a win
2010-09-10T16:33:14  <Palmik> in console, you are informed about disconnect and stuff, but I can not find such info at the game list, not a big deal though since rating resets anyway.
2010-09-10T16:33:24  <Zannick> it will be a win
2010-09-10T16:33:27  <Zannick> but it is not a win
2010-09-10T16:33:30  <JensT1> blue could play really bad, and still lose :p

2010-09-10T16:38:32  <jmcarthur> so if you didn't get anything it's because the mail sending is busted
2010-09-10T16:38:51  <avorntur> I had a little question... when your program runs on the server, is it one instance per round or per game?
2010-09-10T16:38:56  <Palmik> when you submit, does your bot play against all bots or how is that done?
2010-09-10T16:39:04  <jmcarthur> Palmik: currently, random bots
2010-09-10T16:39:08  <JensT1> avorntur: per game
2010-09-10T16:39:09  <zerd> I didn't get mail, but it compiled fine.
2010-09-10T16:39:12  <jmcarthur> Palmik: eventually, bots near your rank
2010-09-10T16:39:16  <avorntur> JensT1: ty, great news :)
2010-09-10T16:39:33  <Palmik> jmcarthur, ok, thanks :)
2010-09-10T16:39:46  <JensT1> they entire environment is recreated for each game
2010-09-10T16:40:35  <JensT1> which is just a new directory actually, not an entire virtual machine
2010-09-10T16:40:41  <JensT1> think that would be to costly
2010-09-10T16:40:53  <Palmik> http://ai-contest.com/advanced_strategy_guide.php he got nothin :/
2010-09-10T16:40:53  <JensT1> but they do have the code for that
2010-09-10T16:44:07  <Palmik> I guess the bots play continually even if no new bot is added, right?
2010-09-10T16:46:28  *** Vio <Vio!~st@91.181.58.29> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-09-10T16:49:13  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-10T16:49:40  <jmcarthur> although i think if it's not already doing this it will eventually be prioritizing newer bots over older ones
2010-09-10T16:50:05  <jmcarthur> but older ones will still get to play sometimes too, afaik
2010-09-10T16:50:07  <Palmik> hmm... I uploaded wrong version on the server and then uploaded the right one, hope they will not even try to compile the old one...
2010-09-10T16:50:38  <Palmik> new goes even for new bots by the same user I guess
2010-09-10T16:51:06  <Zannick> the server stops playing bots once you submit a new version
2010-09-10T16:51:07  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-10T16:51:13  <jmcarthur> .
2010-09-10T16:51:19  <Palmik> thanks :)
2010-09-10T16:51:29  <Zannick> "older" bots as in bots without recent games are the ones prioritized
2010-09-10T16:51:37  <Zannick> but this is not in trunk yet
2010-09-10T16:52:03  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: so I'm sending out my 0-ships from my 0-planet?
2010-09-10T16:52:18  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: at least apparently. it could be an engine or visualizer bug
2010-09-10T16:52:38  <jmcarthur> actually, i didn't check on the java visualizer
2010-09-10T16:52:55  <Palmik> on benzedrine it's treated as illegal move (sending 0size fleets) iirc
2010-09-10T16:53:32  <Palmik> maybe the moves were illegal for some othe reason though
2010-09-10T16:53:32  <jmcarthur> the java viz does it too
2010-09-10T16:53:37  <Palmik> ah
2010-09-10T16:53:41  <avorntur> btw, sending more ships than a planet has makes you surrender
2010-09-10T16:53:55  <avorntur> without an errror/warning
2010-09-10T16:53:59  *** Vio <Vio!~st@91.181.58.29> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-10T16:54:03  <jmcarthur> yea, but sending 0 ships doesn't fit that criterion ;)
2010-09-10T16:54:22  <Zannick> right, but it should be illegal
2010-09-10T16:54:25  <avorntur> ye, but I just mentioned it because it was something that took some debugging :P
2010-09-10T16:54:45  <Mathnerd314> Zannick: or it shouls just be ignored
2010-09-10T16:54:45  <jmcarthur> it should be illegal in the same sense that src==dst should be illegal
2010-09-10T16:55:03  <avorntur> is that illegal?
2010-09-10T16:55:12  <jmcarthur> i was convinced by antimatroid1 that this kind of stuff should be illegal to prevent this situation:
2010-09-10T16:55:17  <Zannick> ignored, right
2010-09-10T16:55:32  <avorntur> I just realized that that occurs in my program
2010-09-10T16:55:36  <avorntur> src==dst
2010-09-10T16:55:40  <jmcarthur> if people see that spamming tiny fleets everywhere causes their opponents to spend more time processesing it, people will do it
2010-09-10T16:55:43  <Palmik> you could spam your opponent with such actions, which would mean more calculations or whatever for him
2010-09-10T16:55:50  <Palmik> you beat me to it :P
2010-09-10T16:56:08  <jmcarthur> while i think that may be an interesting tactic, it isn't in the spirit of this contest, IMO
2010-09-10T16:56:32  <Palmik> I think it would violate the spirit of fair and sportsmanlike competition :D
2010-09-10T16:56:35  <jmcarthur> just like i think it would be interesting for your bot to try hacking the server and controlling its opponent
2010-09-10T16:56:44  <jmcarthur> ... just not really the right thing to do :)
2010-09-10T16:57:05  <Mathnerd314> well, IMO, the competition should be as forgiving as it can to people's bots
2010-09-10T16:57:10  <Palmik> That is also not allowed and the policy is to always prosecute is such thing were to happen :D
2010-09-10T16:57:19  <jmcarthur> i think allowing bots to be spammed hard is unforgiving
2010-09-10T16:57:44  <Palmik> Mathnerd314, allow it maybe... bot do not send it as a command to the enemy
2010-09-10T16:57:48  <jmcarthur> basically i just think 0 sized fleets should be ignored, src==dst should be ignored, and multiple fleets with the same sources and destinations should be ignored
2010-09-10T16:57:56  <Palmik> like... you can issue such order, but it whould be filtered out
2010-09-10T16:57:57  <jmcarthur> but you shouldn't be punished for those, on the other hand
2010-09-10T16:58:02  <jmcarthur> err
2010-09-10T16:58:11  <jmcarthur> that last one shouldn't be ignore. they should be merged, is what i meant
2010-09-10T16:59:05  <jmcarthur> basically the engine should just send minimal information
2010-09-10T16:59:38  <jmcarthur> @later tell amstan i think proggit simply screwed up and isn't showing your submission. maybe we should try again later
2010-09-10T16:59:38  <contestbot> jmcarthur: The operation succeeded.
2010-09-10T16:59:51  <amstan> jmcarthur: i noticed
2010-09-10T17:00:30  <jmcarthur> delete and try again, i suggest
2010-09-10T17:00:50  <jmcarthur> i also have meant to submit to the haskell reddit

2010-09-10T17:16:21  <Palmik> hmm, I see
2010-09-10T17:16:22  <jmcarthur> Palmik: i think the final list had 700-800

2010-09-10T17:17:42  <javagamer_Cpp> So I'm assuming that limits the positions

2010-09-10T17:18:01  <jmcarthur> hornairs: there's a current max turn limit of 200 at least
2010-09-10T17:18:14  <hornairs> jmcarthur ok thanks for the help
2010-09-10T17:18:15  <zaphus> Not really limitless surely. If all planets are 500 units apart, a 200 turn game will be dull

2010-09-10T17:50:39  <amstan> Naktibalda: cool, let me put it on the list
2010-09-10T17:51:12  <Umsturz> hey guys, I got  a questions... some of you are always talking about how the engine should ignore two fleets leaving the same source planet for the same destination... is that something that will be implemented at one point?
2010-09-10T17:51:13  <amstan> a1k0n: yes.. it took me forever to get it
2010-09-10T17:51:21  <amstan> a1k0n: just remember that there's no emails, passwords and hashes
2010-09-10T17:51:30  <a1k0n> i see that. :)
2010-09-10T17:52:06  <a1k0n> the playback_string should really, really not be in that table
2010-09-10T17:52:09  <amstan> but yeah, it took me forever to get it
2010-09-10T17:52:24  <amstan> the whole db is 700mb big
2010-09-10T17:52:36  <amstan> i had to get them separate and all that
2010-09-10T17:52:41  <a1k0n> how big is games.MYD
2010-09-10T17:53:01  <amstan> well.. i took only like 5 rows from games
2010-09-10T17:53:12  <amstan> and the size for the db is now 2.2mb
2010-09-10T17:53:14  <a1k0n> i know, but how big is it now?
2010-09-10T17:53:28  <a1k0n> for how many games played?
2010-09-10T17:53:34  <amstan> hold on, cd /var/lib/mysql
2010-09-10T17:53:44  <a1k0n> select count(*) from games
2010-09-10T17:53:53  <amstan> i can't cd into it
2010-09-10T17:53:59  <a1k0n> oh lame
2010-09-10T17:54:07  <a1k0n> but you have the mysqldump i take it
2010-09-10T17:54:18  <amstan> nope
2010-09-10T17:54:44  <amstan> nvm, i do: -rw-r--r--  1 amstan amstan 695M 2010-09-10 00:14 db.sql

2010-09-10T17:55:45  <a1k0n> what is the point of leaderboards?
2010-09-10T17:56:03  <amstan> a1k0n: there's a script which takes all the games and calculates rankings
2010-09-10T17:56:07  <amstan> then dumps them into leaderboards
2010-09-10T17:56:13  <a1k0n> and rankings
2010-09-10T17:56:16  <amstan> rankings.php reads leaderboards
2010-09-10T17:56:24  <a1k0n> it appears leaderboards is used to determine which is the most recent set of ranking
2010-09-10T17:56:28  <amstan> oh..
2010-09-10T17:56:30  <amstan> yeah
2010-09-10T17:56:31  <amstan> nvm
2010-09-10T17:56:33  <amstan> you're right
2010-09-10T17:56:39  <amstan> it's jeff's system
2010-09-10T17:57:34  <amstan> notice how in the games table.. there's games from may
2010-09-10T17:57:41  <amstan> i don't think jeff pruned them.
2010-09-10T17:58:02  <amstan> we need a cleanup script
2010-09-10T17:58:04  <Zaphus> Hey guys, an idea for the leaderboards page:  Add some overall stats figures:  Total games played, total players, total ships destroyed (if we could track that)  not per user, just overall  - would be cool to see

2010-09-10T18:09:21  <Zannick> my bot should be an example bot

2010-09-10T18:09:39  <seigen> Looks like the launch has gone really well!  Congratulations!
2010-09-10T18:09:44  <Zannick> everyone should be able to beat copybot
2010-09-10T18:09:53  <Zaphus> They are at 64 and 86 respectively (the starterpacks)
2010-09-10T18:10:21  <ermau> It'd be really nice if it told me why I lose at random, it's not crashing or timing out.. just ending.
2010-09-10T18:10:31  <seigen> ermau: have you tried the tcp server?
2010-09-10T18:10:40  <amstan> My bot crashed in a game and after watching the replay a few times I realized that in the last 3-4 turns my fleets disappear when they "collide?" at the center of the map, was that a bug? ok, never mind, there's a little planet at the center of the map, sry
2010-09-10T18:10:50  <ermau> seigen: I have not
2010-09-10T18:11:22  <seigen> ermau: it's very nice, because you run your code locally and connect to the engine, so you can display whatever debugging information you want to stderr
2010-09-10T18:12:00  <seigen> i'm using python, for instance, and PlayGame.jar would swallow whatever stacktraces happened when i blew things up

2010-09-10T18:15:30  <Zannick> yeah, there's a 1 turn delay cause i can't know what they do at the same time they do it
2010-09-10T18:15:48  <Zannick> it wins sometimes
2010-09-10T18:15:50  <avorntur> else you'd prolly tie? :P

2010-09-10T18:16:30  <Palmik> but afaik, when you send fleet with totalTripLegth == 1, it's not shown in the Fleets
2010-09-10T18:17:18  <avorntur> too bad you can't force a match between two profiles :(
2010-09-10T18:17:31  <avorntur> could test versus a friend, and copybot :p

2010-09-10T18:54:23  <_habnabit> JensT1, removed all the silly accessors; added __eq__ and __hash__; made things like Fleet.destination refer to planet objects instead of IDs.

2010-09-10T18:54:33  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: in my bot i'm currently using IO, Maybe, [], Vector (my own newtype around it that forms a monad, anyway), ((->) a), Monoid a => (,) a, Map (which would be a monad if its semantics were slightly different), and i'm sure various others
2010-09-10T18:54:36  <phreeza> you compiled it

2010-09-10T18:55:22  <Zannick> _habnabit: er, making it refer to objects or passing objects probably makes it less efficient

2010-09-10T18:56:26  <_habnabit> Zannick, maybe you're too used to php. Python never implicitly copies anything.

2010-09-10T18:56:58  <_habnabit> Well, php is the only language I know with crazy unpredictable copying semantics.
2010-09-10T18:57:04  <Zannick> i'm too used to c and java where it actually does copy
2010-09-10T18:57:07  <_habnabit> Oh, whoops, forgot about C++.
2010-09-10T18:57:08  <tebele> WTF I see a lot of numbers :S
2010-09-10T18:57:19  <_habnabit> Nah, java's object model is identical to python's.
2010-09-10T18:57:22  <_habnabit> It doesn't copy either.
2010-09-10T18:57:55  <jmcarthur> C and C++ don't copy when you use pass-by-reference, and they only copy pointers when you pass pointers of course
2010-09-10T18:58:08  <a1k0n> hell yeah my coworker uploaded a bot
2010-09-10T18:58:08  <jmcarthur> rather than copying the data in the heap
2010-09-10T18:58:12  <jmcarthur> woot
2010-09-10T18:58:16  <jmcarthur> now you can beat him down
2010-09-10T18:58:18  <_habnabit> (C only has pass-by-value, but passing a pointer by value doesn't copy what it points to.)
2010-09-10T18:58:22  <Zannick> pointers are primitives
2010-09-10T18:58:31  <Zannick> so yes
2010-09-10T18:58:37  <jmcarthur> java and python copy pointers too
2010-09-10T18:58:41  <jmcarthur> but that's muddying waters

2010-09-10T19:17:26  <jmcarthur> JensT1: reports the lower bound of the score rather than the mean. prevents people from jumping around when they haven't played many games. means they gradually rise as they play more games rather than jumping to the top just because they lost a game to a top bot
2010-09-10T19:18:44  <jmcarthur> JensT1: i'm just planning to generate the normal rankings next to the adjusted ones to show how much or how little they change and how much or little sense they make

2010-09-10T19:29:27  <avorntur> how important are the current rankings?
2010-09-10T19:29:44  <avorntur> or are they just for fun and practise, and every ranking before the deadline = irrelevant?
2010-09-10T19:30:18  <JensT1> avorntur: these are irrelevant I think
2010-09-10T19:30:30  <s_denchev> when you upload a new version of the bot its rank is returned to default
2010-09-10T19:30:32  <caytchen> well i would assume that every ranking before the deadline is irrevelant, but if your question is if this challenge is already over, then i think the answer is 'no' :)
2010-09-10T19:30:38  <JensT1> don't think there's a system where every player gets points now depending on how long he's on top of the list
2010-09-10T19:31:14  <JensT1> which is ok, since you have to prove yourself by starting with an average elo again everytime you upload a bot
2010-09-10T19:33:56  <phreeza> avorntur: the way i understand it is after the deadline ends a complete tournament will be held and the rankings from that are what counts.

2010-09-10T20:09:26  <javagamer_Cpp> I realize I can do it w/ printf, but I'm curious if there's another way
2010-09-10T20:10:16  <caytchen> you should probably look into stringstreams

2010-09-10T20:11:00  <syntaxglitch> Is there a known issue being worked on? Or do I need to contact someone :(
2010-09-10T20:11:11  <caytchen> basically you can do something like this with them: std::stringstream stream; stream << "I'm " << 11 << " years old and INT_MAX is " << INT_MAX; stream.str() gives you a std::string then

2010-09-10T20:22:18  <antimatroid1> i will probably change my implementation just order players one and two first rather than compare their values more than once, but I don't think it works nicely to just sort all three ship amounts

2010-09-10T20:38:04  <caytchen> :(
2010-09-10T20:39:02  <rwa_> can someone update me on the status of the battle resolution rules and implementation?  I just ran my tests against the latest PlayGame.jar and it still seems to have the off-by-one against neutrals bug.  Is this bug in the server code, too?
2010-09-10T20:39:59  <a1k0n> rwa_: how do you mean?
2010-09-10T20:40:03  <antimatroid1> rwa: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=474
2010-09-10T20:40:08  <a1k0n> if a neutral planet has 10 ships you need to send 11 to take it
2010-09-10T20:40:10  <antimatroid1> I'm pretty sure I got that right
2010-09-10T20:40:46  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: it was previously taking 2 ships to go past 0

2010-09-10T20:42:14  <a1k0n> yeah, it no longer takes 2.  that was fixed right?
2010-09-10T20:42:25  <antimatroid1> i haven't looked, that was the question :P
2010-09-10T20:42:26  <a1k0n> i definitely see that fixed
2010-09-10T20:42:30  <dstufft> is the PlayGame.jar in the starter pack up to date, or do i need to update it from somewhere?
2010-09-10T20:42:31  <antimatroid1> okay, good
2010-09-10T20:42:37  <a1k0n> my bot always sends N+1 to neutrals
2010-09-10T20:42:55  <antimatroid1> i believe it's more complicated than that
2010-09-10T20:42:56  <a1k0n> dstufft: they released new starter packs last night; unfortunately they don't provide times or version numbers on them
2010-09-10T20:43:04  <antimatroid1> i think i have a pretty good idea, it's just going to take a little while
2010-09-10T20:43:16  <dstufft> a1k0n: ok then i have the latest version
2010-09-10T20:43:22  <a1k0n> to take neutrals in general?  yes, you'll need a lot more ships to take the neutral sitting right next to your opponent
2010-09-10T20:43:38  <dstufft> now to figure out how to unjar so i can apply the patch you made >.>
2010-09-10T20:43:44  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: to cover the strategic side of situations
2010-09-10T20:43:56  <a1k0n> dstufft: it should have the patch
2010-09-10T20:44:08  <a1k0n> dstufft: at any rate http://a1k0n.net/temp/PlayGame.jar has my latest one
2010-09-10T20:44:14  <a1k0n> (and ShowGame.jar)
2010-09-10T20:45:44  <drewrobb> wow this ship count graph is great
2010-09-10T20:46:03  <antimatroid1> drewrobb: what?
2010-09-10T20:46:11  <drewrobb> on the canvas visualizer

2010-09-10T20:47:04  <dstufft> before i say screw it and just take a random sample of the 100 maps

2010-09-10T21:22:49  <amstan> j3camero: mail server failed, server's getting slow
2010-09-10T21:22:55  <syntaxglitch> jmcarthur, yeah, this is the first chance I've had to really sit down and look at anything
2010-09-10T21:22:56  <a1k0n> well it kinda was

2010-09-10T21:23:31  <j3camero> a1k0n: yeah I guess that's true. The site is basically unavailable for stretches at a time. We have to create a slow query log to see what's wong.
2010-09-10T21:23:51  <a1k0n> j3camero: give amstan access to /var/db/mysql at least
2010-09-10T21:24:00  <jmcarthur> no, give amstan root
2010-09-10T21:24:07  <j3camero> amstan: sadly, no. I doubt getting more servers will help. This problem looks like it's just a slow mysql query.
2010-09-10T21:24:29  <amstan> j3camero: why is the server a p4?
2010-09-10T21:24:39  <j3camero> amstan: do you want root? I will give it to you. You have time during the day, I don't.
2010-09-10T21:24:50  <a1k0n> j3camero: what do you think about moving the game logs out of the database entirely so that they can at least be a fast web request instead of a php/database hit
2010-09-10T21:24:51  <amstan> j3camero: well.. i had time, this week
2010-09-10T21:24:58  <amstan> j3camero: yeah.. go ahead
2010-09-10T21:24:59  <ulope> j3camero: Probably add generous amounts of memcahed and / or varnish
2010-09-10T21:25:07  <a1k0n> yes, that ^^
2010-09-10T21:25:43  <a1k0n> i got to go eat
2010-09-10T21:26:07  <j3camero> We clearly need more admins. Anybody here willing to not be a contestant so they can help out with these things? I will also yell for help in the #CSC channel to see if I can get some of the awesome people who helped with TRon.
2010-09-10T21:26:28  <a1k0n> i would like to help but i would like to be a contestant more :/
2010-09-10T21:26:32  <jmcarthur> asking somebody not to compete is a heavy order
2010-09-10T21:26:51  <jmcarthur> i too wish to compete
2010-09-10T21:26:54  <j3camero> a1k0n: I wanted to ask you if you wanted to become a "gatekeeper" on the code repo, to help me increase the turnaround time on these code reviews. You would still just be dealing with the open soruce project, so you would still compete. Let me know.
2010-09-10T21:27:17  <a1k0n> perhaps but i don't have any way to test the backend
2010-09-10T21:27:20  <j3camero> Yeah, I suppose you all want to compete. That's what it's all about!
2010-09-10T21:27:44  <syntaxglitch> yeah, I'm a programming contest junkie :(
2010-09-10T21:27:49  <j3camero> a1k0n: what would you need? I can do a database schema dump so you can set up your own instance for example.
2010-09-10T21:27:51  <a1k0n> but i do think it's vital that we start version-numbering the starter packs
2010-09-10T21:28:00  <a1k0n> j3camero: amstan provided one already actually
2010-09-10T21:28:08  <a1k0n> i guess i could set something up
2010-09-10T21:28:23  <a1k0n> i probably won't have any time this weekend tho
2010-09-10T21:28:55  <j3camero> a1k0n: awesome. I am going to do a bunch of work on testing the python engine tomorrow. Right now I just have to do some public facing stuff (updating the website etc) and then sleep. I haven't slept more than 4 hours a night all week.
2010-09-10T21:29:11  <a1k0n> ugh
2010-09-10T21:29:29  <ulope> j3camero: i would certainly help out but I at least would want to compete "out-of-the-running" (i.e. still be able to submit code but not "get" anything should I win (which isn't going to happen anyway so..))
2010-09-10T21:30:17  <jmcarthur> kind of steals somebody's thunder if you beat them despite being disqualified

2010-09-10T21:31:48  <j3camero> I would really like someone who can do a bit of sysadminning. Right now, the most critical thing is to set up a mysql slow query log (google mysql slow query log) so we can find out what's locking up the website.
2010-09-10T21:31:55  <danielvf> j3camero: I'd be willing to step out of the contest and help with website admin
2010-09-10T21:32:14  <j3camero> jmcarthur: totally understandable for sure. I only asked in case there was someone dying to become an admin.
2010-09-10T21:33:27  <syntaxglitch> j3camero, the next AI challenge should be to write the best AI challenge server
2010-09-10T21:33:29  <j3camero> danielvf: would you feel confident taking a crack at the mysql slow query log thing, and possibly profiling the PHP code? I am not sure what your background is. I have seen many quality issues and patches from you, so I dig this idea. I just want to get to know your background a bit out of curiosity.
2010-09-10T21:33:41  <jmcarthur> danielvf: anybody willing to do that earns uber respect in my book

2010-09-10T21:34:09  <danielvf> I currently maintain about a dozen webservers
2010-09-10T21:34:26  <syntaxglitch> j3camero, but will it have a leaderboard? :P
2010-09-10T21:34:36  <ulope> j3camero: Well I guess nobody who isn't an admin by profession really wants to be one, but sometimes it's just what you have to do ;)
2010-09-10T21:34:53  <j3camero> danielvf: okay then you are exactly who I dreamed to find. Final answer? Once I send you root, there is no turning back.
2010-09-10T21:35:03  <syntaxglitch> j3camero, also that would be "like everyone else submits bots" because I still don't have an account :( :( :(
2010-09-10T21:35:23  <danielvf> j3camero: I'll step carefully. Won't do evil.
2010-09-10T21:35:36  <j3camero> syntaxglitch: yes sorry about the mail issue. Fucking gmail SMTP servers banning me!
2010-09-10T21:35:42  <zeiris> Nice to see a1kon joining this contest too, and at the top of the ladder :D
2010-09-10T21:35:47  <jmcarthur> danielvf: i think he meant "this is your last chance to stay in the competition"

2010-09-10T21:36:21  <danielvf> Yes, I'm a commiter.
2010-09-10T21:37:22  <j3camero> danielvf: would you pm me your personal email address? Also, join the mailing list linked from the home page of the Google Code project. I will send you the details you need to get in.

2010-09-10T21:37:48  <j3camero> ulope: yes
2010-09-10T21:38:14  <j3camero> just sending outgoing email using SMTP as donotreply@ai-contest.com, through google apps
2010-09-10T21:38:22  <ulope> j3camero: and I assume you send all of the sites emails through that?
2010-09-10T21:38:24  <j3camero> but apparently I got cut off
2010-09-10T21:38:29  <j3camero> yes
2010-09-10T21:38:47  <j3camero> Not any more though. The amazing mike ellis changed the mail so it got fixed... sort of.
2010-09-10T21:38:49  <amstan> j3camero: how about using csclub as a mirror?
2010-09-10T21:38:58  <amstan> j3camero: now it's being spam filtered

2010-09-10T21:39:24  <j3camero> amstan: the problem isnt that we are exceeding our server's capacity. It's just tht we have some poorly design sql query somewhere in the pipe that is locking a bunch of tables for seconds at a time.
2010-09-10T21:39:37  <ulope> is "donotreply@ai-contest.com" registered as an alias of the google apps account youre using?

2010-09-10T21:41:20  <amstan> only the registering mails

2010-09-10T21:41:46  <ulope> j3camero: Hm.. In theory that should work but I had similar problems in the past. Did you consider setting up a simple exim outgoing only server on the conest machine?

2010-09-10T22:20:51  <bss03> Reading.
2010-09-10T22:21:19  <bss03> jmcarther: 82% of the time it is in buildGameState, which is called which each line of input.
2010-09-10T22:21:29  <jmcarthur> bss03: are you using the newest engine?
2010-09-10T22:21:37  <jmcarthur> the newest version of it, i mean
2010-09-10T22:21:57  <caytchen> what language?
2010-09-10T22:22:01  <bss03> I downloaded the Java start kit today.
2010-09-10T22:22:10  <bss03> To put of PlayGame.jar and ShowGame.jar
2010-09-10T22:22:12  <syntaxglitch> bss03, why rebuild the game state every time?
2010-09-10T22:22:16  <bss03> s/put/pull/
2010-09-10T22:22:42  <bss03> syntaxglitch: buildGameState should be called updateGameState
2010-09-10T22:23:25  <bss03> syntaxglitch: It takes an existing game state and a line of input from the server then returns a new state with the new object added.
2010-09-10T22:23:43  <jmcarthur> which language?
2010-09-10T22:23:51  <jmcarthur> oh java
2010-09-10T22:23:58  <bss03> jmcarthur: Haskell is what I'm writing in.
2010-09-10T22:24:00  <caytchen> how could someone possibly fuck that up so badly? i'm using the c# one and while its crap it doesn't have exponential complexit hehe.
2010-09-10T22:24:07  <jmcarthur> bss03: oh, so this is your own starter?
2010-09-10T22:24:09  <bss03> jmcarthur: I'm using the Java engine and viewer locally though.
2010-09-10T22:24:27  <bss03> jmcarther: Not really, jaspervdj wrote the broilerplate.
2010-09-10T22:24:36  <jmcarthur> because jaspervdj's starter doesn't have that function, as far as i can see
2010-09-10T22:24:47  <jmcarthur> oh wait, yeah it does
2010-09-10T22:24:49  <jmcarthur> nevermind
2010-09-10T22:24:58  <bss03> jmcarthur: buildGameState is in PlanetWars.hs
2010-09-10T22:25:50  <jmcarthur> yeah that function looks slower than necessary to me. i'm not a fan of the lazy IO in that whole thing. unpredictable performance. plus there's the NoBuffering thing, which would probably be better with LineBuffering
2010-09-10T22:26:16  <jmcarthur> buildGameState uses (!!) rather than pattern matching, too, which is strange
2010-09-10T22:26:22  <jmcarthur> not sure if it should be taking *that* long though
2010-09-10T22:26:27  <jmcarthur> are you compiling with optimizations?
2010-09-10T22:27:04  <bss03> jmcarthur: Yeah, I thought maybe the (!!) was an issue, but it's not.  I added SCC annotations on the case results and the times spend there is relatively low.
2010-09-10T22:27:13  <jmcarthur> where is it long?
2010-09-10T22:27:32  <bss03> Hrm, you know, probably not using -O2.  Maybe I just need that. :P
2010-09-10T22:27:38  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-10T22:27:41  <jmcarthur> yeah -O2 is magical :)
2010-09-10T22:28:13  <bss03> Well, buildGameState takes 82% of my time.
2010-09-10T22:28:13  <jmcarthur> the server uses -O2, for the record
2010-09-10T22:28:20  <jmcarthur> that's still bad, yes
2010-09-10T22:28:44  <bss03> But, addFleet (the "F" exprssion) and addPlanet (the "P" expression) only take 0.3% of the time.
2010-09-10T22:28:57  <jmcarthur> i'm planning to write my own IO. i might release my own starter when its ready
2010-09-10T22:29:22  <bss03> I'll try -O2 and see if I get lucky with some magic.
2010-09-10T22:30:16  <bss03> Nope, no magic luck. :(
2010-09-10T22:30:23  <jmcarthur> darn
2010-09-10T22:30:27  <antimatroid1> would it be worth posting about ai thing in /r/math as well, or would anyone in there that cares have already seen it?
2010-09-10T22:30:38  <jmcarthur> maybe i should try it
2010-09-10T22:30:44  <jmcarthur> i'll do that
2010-09-10T22:30:49  <caytchen> bss03: so wheres the big performance loss? all in blocking IO?

2010-09-10T22:38:13  <bss03> jmcarthur: I'm just getting timeouts locally.  I thought it might be some of my new code that I'm testing, so I did one pass at optimizing that.

2010-09-10T22:43:17  <j3camero> I am about to propose that we loosen the rules so that code reviews do not have to be approved by me. A code review could be approved by any other dev that is not you.
2010-09-10T22:43:34  <antimatroid1> j3camero: make it 2 other developers
2010-09-10T22:43:53  <antimatroid1> or maybe not
2010-09-10T22:44:02  <j3camero> antimatroid1: can you share yor reasons why? from experience?
2010-09-10T22:44:05  <jmcarthur> bss03: for some reason i am failing to get profiling data out of mine...
2010-09-10T22:44:11  <bss03> Hrm, I don't think it is timing out, exactly.  It is crashing, I'm not not seeing the error message.
2010-09-10T22:44:28  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i'll join in a minute
2010-09-10T22:44:35  <antimatroid1> j3camero: I have no experience in open source stuff, just seems better to have 2 other eyes look than one
2010-09-10T22:44:36  <j3camero> jmcarthur: awesome.
2010-09-10T22:44:38  <bss03> jmcarthur: I only got 4 ticks, which isn't much, and my program ran for a bit.
2010-09-10T22:45:07  <bss03> jmcarthur: Yep, strace shows I tried an integer divide by zero.  Boo me.
2010-09-10T22:45:07  <jmcarthur> bss03: that sucks...
2010-09-10T22:45:19  <bss03> jmcarthur: Sorry for the noise. :P
2010-09-10T22:45:24  <jmcarthur> bss03: if that didn't throw a ghc exception there is a bug in the runtime...
2010-09-10T22:45:33  <jmcarthur> bss03: unless you are using FFI or something?
2010-09-10T22:45:49  <jmcarthur> actually
2010-09-10T22:45:50  <jmcarthur> err
2010-09-10T22:45:54  <bss03> It did, but I guess I had redirected that particular output somewhere incorrectly and wasn't seeing it.
2010-09-10T22:46:02  <jmcarthur> oh okay
2010-09-10T22:46:05  <jmcarthur> that explains it then
2010-09-10T22:46:18  <jmcarthur> now i'm mystified about why i can't seem to get profiling data out of this thing...
2010-09-10T22:46:19  <bss03> Looks like it wrote to stderr, which I was pretty sure I was viewing.
2010-09-10T22:46:54  <bss03> Maybe PlayGame.java hooks up to that fd in the child unintentionally?
2010-09-10T22:46:54  <jmcarthur> j3camero: is that the ai-contest-discuss list?
2010-09-10T22:47:07  <jmcarthur> maybe
2010-09-10T22:47:45  <jmcarthur> i've applied for the list
2010-09-10T22:49:28  <antimatroid1> hmmm, would you guys consider it safe to go with the current c++ starter package?
2010-09-10T22:49:40  <antimatroid1> i'm planning to fuck around with planet wars quite a bit
2010-09-10T22:50:34  <amstan> j3camero: also.. who's an organizer now?

2010-09-10T22:50:58  <Zaphus> antimatroid1:  my bot is based on the earlier version of the starter, but I've been updating it to match the current starter each time, it was good yesterday but I havent checked today
2010-09-10T22:51:37  <Cyndre> submitted my first bot - oooo
2010-09-10T22:51:47  <millertime> grats :)
2010-09-10T22:51:53  <Cyndre> we shall see
2010-09-10T22:51:55  <millertime> just submitted my first "real" work
2010-09-10T22:52:03  <Cyndre> its rather lame right now so I dont expect much
2010-09-10T22:52:09  <millertime> before this i was rank 100 with hardly anything modified :P
2010-09-10T22:52:14  <antimatroid1> yeah but I want to change how fleets are set up and make everything public etc.
2010-09-10T22:52:34  <millertime> cmon bot, fight!!
2010-09-10T22:52:37  <antimatroid1> so will be hard to merge with any future versions of planetwars.h unless it's obvious semantic fixes

2010-09-10T22:53:04  <Cyndre> my bot is going to beat your bot up
2010-09-10T22:53:17  <Zaphus> antimatroid1:  honestly nothing much has changed of recent, it's mostly been the .jar files - but I;ll grab latest and compare
2010-09-10T22:53:26  <jmcarthur> my changes are fundamental enough that i'm just writing my own starter instead of using an existing one
2010-09-10T22:54:09  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  I'll do that at some point, but for now it's enough for me to experiment with (and stay in top 10 more or less)
2010-09-10T22:55:12  <millertime> Cyndre: bring it on ;)
2010-09-10T22:55:20  <Cyndre> waiting
2010-09-10T22:55:21  <Cyndre> lol
2010-09-10T22:55:26  <millertime> do you test against all the sample bots?
2010-09-10T22:55:41  <Zaphus> actually, I am running with the latest starter pack.

2010-09-10T22:56:15  <Cyndre> I tested against the MyBot.py original
2010-09-10T22:56:54  <Zaphus> oh, and I created a "DormantBot" initially, it issues no orders - I'd occasionally lose to that and know it was due to an illegal move or a timeout :)

2010-09-10T22:57:23  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: not necessarily
2010-09-10T22:57:40  <antimatroid1> it's possible that you somehow failed to take out a neutral and lost more ships :P
2010-09-10T22:57:41  <millertime> Cyndre: i think Prospector bot is the same as the sample
2010-09-10T22:58:10  <antimatroid1> although, admitidely, unlikely
2010-09-10T22:58:11  <millertime> but like Zaphus pointed out, i think Rage and Dual are the only ones you should worry about getting marginally beaten by
2010-09-10T22:58:48  <Zaphus> antimatroid1:  Whatever the cause, it would set off alarm bells, you really shouldn't lose to it :-)
2010-09-10T22:58:50  <Cyndre> they need more game servers now :)
2010-09-10T22:59:26  <dstufft> what's the best way to debug these things? just using print statements?
2010-09-10T22:59:27  <antimatroid1> yes, but i wouldn't use it as a strict test of time out/illegal move
2010-09-10T22:59:37  <antimatroid1> i'm using output files
2010-09-10T22:59:43  <antimatroid1> and outputing whatever I want on each turn
2010-09-10T23:00:10  <Cyndre> how long till you will see your first game?
2010-09-10T23:00:25  <antimatroid1> hard to say when it's this busy
2010-09-10T23:00:26  <jmcarthur> it takes a little while right now
2010-09-10T23:00:39  <caytchen> try the tcp server ;)
2010-09-10T23:00:42  <Cyndre> is there a private server yet?
2010-09-10T23:00:44  <antimatroid1> lots of bots are being added with similar priorities for new games
2010-09-10T23:00:49  <antimatroid1> there is

2010-09-10T23:02:03  <millertime> thats probably a dumb noob way of doing it though

2010-09-10T23:02:31  <antimatroid1> including smaller maps you wish to create
2010-09-10T23:02:42  <caytchen> also, if anyone cares, my C# stuff for using the tcp server: http://pastie.org/private/qayjiajr1b4drxkyqlbaxq
2010-09-10T23:03:02  <millertime> antimatroid1: i'm probably just a huge noob but getting output to cooperate was much more difficult than just spamming my code with comment marks
2010-09-10T23:03:40  <antimatroid1> I'm not much of a programmer either, are you using c++? just use ofstreams
2010-09-10T23:03:42  <Cyndre> anyone using a python bot on tcp server yet?
2010-09-10T23:03:55  <antimatroid1> Cyndre: you run your bot locally
2010-09-10T23:04:03  <Zaphus> did someone make a tcp bit of code to run on win32 ?  the supplied one wont compile, I remember someone said there was another ?
2010-09-10T23:04:12  <antimatroid1> so you can also output debug locally too
2010-09-10T23:04:28  <antimatroid1> i think some people got it going witha  vm
2010-09-10T23:04:32  <antimatroid1> or maybe even cygwin?
2010-09-10T23:04:39  <Zaphus> too much effort :)
2010-09-10T23:04:51  <antimatroid1> cygwin shouldn't be
2010-09-10T23:05:06  <jmcarthur> yeah cygwin has a nice installer and everything for you

2010-09-10T23:05:57  <millertime> ;)
2010-09-10T23:06:04  <jmcarthur> wubi is nice if you like ubuntu..
2010-09-10T23:06:22  <jmcarthur> i personally can't stand ubuntu
2010-09-10T23:06:25  <millertime> eh, as far as i know you can still put xmonad on wubi :)
2010-09-10T23:06:39  <jmcarthur> sure, but that doesn't make me like ubuntu any better

2010-09-10T23:07:55  <millertime> agreed, but if you have to work around windows.. i find wubi the best way to do so :)
2010-09-10T23:08:02  <Zaphus> ok, so if I got cygwin - how does that help ?   what do I do with it ?
2010-09-10T23:08:14  <antimatroid1> use it like a command line? that's what i do aha, seems to work
2010-09-10T23:08:21  <antimatroid1> although i haven't tried it for this thing
2010-09-10T23:08:40  <Zaphus> but I'd also need to get gcc too, right, and probably more things
2010-09-10T23:08:44  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: it basically gives you a unixy command line to use
2010-09-10T23:08:49  <cbeck> jmcarthur: Funny that, switching to xmonad on ubuntu was what made it not worth my time to move to another distro
2010-09-10T23:08:51  <dmj111> I have not tried it either, but you should be able to get gcc.
2010-09-10T23:08:51  <dstufft> is j3camero around
2010-09-10T23:08:53  <caytchen> well cygwin does offer gcc and stuff ;)
2010-09-10T23:08:54  <dmj111> (with cygwin)
2010-09-10T23:08:54  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: cygwin should offer you a choice to install gcc automatically
2010-09-10T23:09:09  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: it kind of functions like a package manager of sorts
2010-09-10T23:09:34  <jmcarthur> cbeck: i can't stand maintaining ubuntu
2010-09-10T23:09:37  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  yeah, I think I'll pass - not really wanting to install that much stuff on this machine.   maybe I'll just have to do a winsock version of tcp.c
2010-09-10T23:09:37  <millertime> for my linux-based laptop i definitely got rid of ubuntu when i discovered the wonder of ARCH :D
2010-09-10T23:09:38  <antimatroid1> hmmm i'm using mingw compiler, is that going to cause issues? I know nothing about these things
2010-09-10T23:09:57  <jmcarthur> arch is love :D
2010-09-10T23:09:59  <antimatroid1> for trying to do stuff with tcp that is
2010-09-10T23:10:31  <millertime> dang i went up to rank 39 :)
2010-09-10T23:11:36  <antimatroid1> nice
2010-09-10T23:11:58  <Cyndre> he made an illegal move :(
2010-09-10T23:12:00  <millertime> only one game so far though :P and a loss, at that

2010-09-10T23:14:13  <caytchen> is there a penalty to it right now?

2010-09-10T23:16:30  <sigh> if you want to be able to issue orders like that, the the simplest is to modify IssueOrder to silently ignore them
2010-09-10T23:16:43  <jmcarthur> or to throw an error

2010-09-10T23:24:18  <sigh> Zannick: that id is generated by your bot not the server
2010-09-10T23:24:21  <jmcarthur> stay stoned
2010-09-10T23:24:29  <RobotCaleb> no thanks
2010-09-10T23:24:35  <Zannick> no, it's generated by the engine, as it passes the fleets in order
2010-09-10T23:24:43  <amstan> contestbot: topic add Now your code reviews can be approved by any other developer, no need for admin intervention.

2010-09-10T23:24:47  <jmcarthur> Zannick: oh implicit ids?
2010-09-10T23:24:58  <Zannick> it is useless for everything but accessing from the list of fleets
2010-09-10T23:25:11  <Zannick> i tore that apart
2010-09-10T23:25:36  <Zannick> i might just program from scratch in c
2010-09-10T23:25:52  <jmcarthur> hmm... i think my confusion was the spec
2010-09-10T23:26:06  <jmcarthur> is says that planets have implicit ids, but it doesn't say the same for fleets
2010-09-10T23:26:14  <antimatroid1> holy shit, indentation fixes are a life saver
2010-09-10T23:26:19  <jmcarthur> if fleets are always given in the same order then i am a little happier
2010-09-10T23:26:22  <antimatroid1> fixers*
2010-09-10T23:26:37  <Zannick> jmcarthur: yes, but some will disappear and some will appear
2010-09-10T23:26:44  <jmcarthur> of course
2010-09-10T23:26:52  <jmcarthur> meaning some ids will shift
2010-09-10T23:26:55  <jmcarthur> okay
2010-09-10T23:27:26  <jmcarthur> okay, so then... like i said earlier... i wish fleets had ids.
2010-09-10T23:27:30  <jmcarthur> *explicit* ones
2010-09-10T23:27:35  <jmcarthur> that don't change from turn to turn
2010-09-10T23:27:59  <jmcarthur> it would allow me to avoid processing fleets that i already know about
2010-09-10T23:28:00  <Zannick> make up something?
2010-09-10T23:28:11  <jmcarthur> making it up wouldn't help :P
2010-09-10T23:28:18  <Zannick> like hash the src and turn launched
2010-09-10T23:28:25  <Zannick> er, src, dest, turn launched
2010-09-10T23:28:27  <zeiris> You could diff the state each time, and find the changes.
2010-09-10T23:28:38  <zeiris> Then from that, build your own representation.
2010-09-10T23:28:46  <jmcarthur> yucky
2010-09-10T23:28:50  <Zannick> jmcarthur: oh, you want to only process *new* fleets?
2010-09-10T23:28:54  <jmcarthur> right!
2010-09-10T23:28:57  <zeiris> Yeah, fairly. :\
2010-09-10T23:29:04  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o danielvf
2010-09-10T23:29:06  <jmcarthur> only new ones. i don't care about the ones i know about already
2010-09-10T23:29:06  <Zannick> hint: those are the ones with totaltraveltime - turnsremaining = 1
2010-09-10T23:29:09  <zeiris> Hide it in an abstraction, then pretend the code doesn't exist :)
2010-09-10T23:29:13  <jmcarthur> yeah i know
2010-09-10T23:31:25  <jmcarthur> i guess that is sufficient

2010-09-10T23:34:59  <bss03> I have a game result that ShowGame.jar won't display.
2010-09-10T23:35:03  <zeiris> Does the server have the Vector library available on it?
2010-09-10T23:35:13  <bss03> It crashes with an IndexOutOfBoundsException. :(

2010-09-10T23:35:35  <Cyndre> any easy way to run the tcp server from windows?
2010-09-10T23:35:49  <bss03> Nooo, that's not true.  This file just has junk in it.
2010-09-10T23:40:09  <blkperl> when are organization links going to be fixed?
2010-09-10T23:40:11  <millertime> is it possible to change the description you write on your profile?
2010-09-10T23:40:28  <jmcarthur> zeiris: the Vector haskell library?
2010-09-10T23:40:43  <jmcarthur> zeiris: i doubt it. i doubt vector even works well with ghc 6.8.2
2010-09-10T23:41:20  <jmcarthur> millertime: if you ask a maintainer really nicely

2010-09-10T23:50:40  <Zannick> helpful
2010-09-10T23:54:24  <PurplePanda> will turns_remaining of a fleet always be above 0?
2010-09-10T23:55:12  <Zannick> turns remaining = 1 means that you have one turn before it lands
2010-09-10T23:55:15  <Zannick> so yes
2010-09-10T23:55:20  <j3camero> I put a little note on the front page: http://ai-contest.com

2010-09-10T23:59:17  <millertime> same
2010-09-10T23:59:21  <jmcarthur> i think it's just the server timing out
