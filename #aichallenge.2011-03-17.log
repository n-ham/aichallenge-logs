2011-03-17T00:00:08  <amstan> you mean can't?
2011-03-17T00:00:17  <McLeopold> yeah, can't
2011-03-17T00:00:25  <amstan> what gfx card?
2011-03-17T00:00:31  <McLeopold> nvida
2011-03-17T00:00:45  <amstan> do you have the proprietary driver?
2011-03-17T00:00:57  <McLeopold> I think so
2011-03-17T00:01:25  <amstan> McLeopold: k.. find the control panel thingy for nvidia
2011-03-17T00:01:27  <amstan> http://i10.tinypic.com/2zz729e.png
2011-03-17T00:01:36  <amstan> get to that screen, make sure you don't have separate x screen
2011-03-17T00:01:38  <amstan> but twinview
2011-03-17T00:01:44  <McLeopold> NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current) [Recommended]
2011-03-17T00:02:03  <amstan> "nvidia-settings" is what you need to run for that control panel thingy
2011-03-17T00:02:46  <McLeopold> why must it always fail to parse!
2011-03-17T00:02:57  <amstan> oh yeah.. lol
2011-03-17T00:03:01  <amstan> that's a bug in the driver, lol
2011-03-17T00:03:15  <amstan> do you want to make this thing permanent?
2011-03-17T00:03:18  <McLeopold> I have to type in extra settings now
2011-03-17T00:03:22  <amstan> then you have to fix it.. if not.. you can just ignore it
2011-03-17T00:03:57  <amstan> it's just a bunch of quotes that's missing in the default xorg file
2011-03-17T00:04:07  <amstan> that's why the nvidia thingy complains
2011-03-17T00:04:16  <amstan> comment it, then make the changes
2011-03-17T00:04:20  <McLeopold> yeah, the first time I rebooted it took me to console only
2011-03-17T00:04:33  <McLeopold> now I have to add a module section with "glx"
2011-03-17T00:07:35  <McLeopold> amstan: failed to set MetaMode(1)'CRT-0 bla bla bla
2011-03-17T00:08:02  <amstan> yeah, just make sure you have default settings for just one monitor to start with
2011-03-17T00:08:06  <amstan> then setup twinview

2011-03-17T00:13:39  <amstan> McLeopold: probably not, you should be able to type the size manually
2011-03-17T00:13:59  <McLeopold> it's a dropdown in the config
2011-03-17T00:14:11  <McLeopold> Unless you mean panning?
2011-03-17T00:14:22  <amstan> darn, you're right
2011-03-17T00:14:52  <amstan> McLeopold: it should detect them though...
2011-03-17T00:15:08  <amstan> unless you have a funky monitor or cable
2011-03-17T00:15:26  <McLeopold> It's not, I'm not getting the full resolution.  Could be the graphics card I guess.  But I'm pretty sure in windows it works.

2011-03-17T06:36:39  <antimatroid> i think that's a bad idea, i think it's good if people can accurately estimate the result of their moves

2011-03-17T06:37:37  <antimatroid> with option 1, you need like vision = 2*attack + (1or2) in order for people to be able to calculate accurately, you can't guarantee it with option 2 and a fog of war
2011-03-17T06:38:31  <sigh> fair enough
2011-03-17T06:43:38  <antimatroid> actually, i think it could be reduced with option 1, not as far as green_tea suggested, but could be done

2011-03-17T07:04:24  <antimatroid> i guess i have to do % too :P
2011-03-17T07:04:37  <antimatroid> for gcd and lcm
2011-03-17T07:05:38  <sigh> why not use a library? or you doing it just to learn?
2011-03-17T07:08:56  <antimatroid> a bit for learning but mostly because i want GTL to be usable with just stl
2011-03-17T07:09:03  <antimatroid> (GTL == my game theory library)
2011-03-17T07:09:14  <antimatroid> it's all done with templates so that people could use say GMP if they wanted
2011-03-17T07:09:45  <antimatroid> although I'm having trouble passing Rational<BigInt> as a type for payoffs (tensor) values atm as well :\
2011-03-17T07:10:12  <antimatroid> it'll take Rational<int> and BigInt, but not Rational<BigInt> :\
2011-03-17T07:10:50  <sigh> does BigInt have all the methods it needs?
2011-03-17T07:10:57  <sigh> for Rational to do it's stuff
2011-03-17T07:11:21  <antimatroid> i think so
2011-03-17T07:11:26  <antimatroid> i will look later
2011-03-17T07:12:18  <sigh> antimatroid: quick question, how you are you representing negative bigints?
2011-03-17T07:12:21  <antimatroid> i think the problem is coming in when it tries to cast (Rational<BigIng>) 0
2011-03-17T07:12:33  <antimatroid> with a negative bool variable
2011-03-17T07:12:41  <antimatroid> it's messy for +,- but i think i've got the logic right
2011-03-17T07:12:57  <sigh> that's no good... use 2's complement
2011-03-17T07:13:08  <sigh> essentially treat it like a 2-adic integer :P
2011-03-17T07:13:25  <antimatroid> but I have like a vector of integers for a number?
2011-03-17T07:13:35  <antimatroid> and each integer can go up to like 9999999 or something like that
2011-03-17T07:13:49  <sigh> make them go up to a power of 2
2011-03-17T07:14:03  <sigh> but this fits with a vector of integers
2011-03-17T07:14:29  <antimatroid> so switch everything to base 2?
2011-03-17T07:14:57  <antimatroid> except the actual ints obviously
2011-03-17T07:15:17  <sigh> errr... actual ints are base 2
2011-03-17T07:15:18  <sigh> ?
2011-03-17T07:15:28  <sigh> i mean everything is binary on disk
2011-03-17T07:15:32  <antimatroid> well my local representation :P
2011-03-17T07:15:48  <sigh> how do you represent ints?
2011-03-17T07:15:49  *** needsch <needsch!~Robert@ip-81-210-159-12.unitymediagroup.de> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-17T07:15:59  <antimatroid> the normal way
2011-03-17T07:16:08  <antimatroid> i mean the way i go like int x = 10
2011-03-17T07:16:12  <antimatroid> that doesn't make x = 2
2011-03-17T07:16:16  <antimatroid> binary style
2011-03-17T07:16:57  <sigh> but when you say x = 10, x is actually "...01010" in ram
2011-03-17T07:17:14  <antimatroid> yes
2011-03-17T07:17:50  <antimatroid> but my local interpreation is 10 = 1010
2011-03-17T07:17:53  <antimatroid> not 10 = 2
2011-03-17T07:18:16  <sigh> this is when you are parsing and outputing?
2011-03-17T07:18:37  <sigh> of course, you never need to show the binary repr to the user
2011-03-17T07:18:46  <antimatroid> that's my point
2011-03-17T07:19:01  <antimatroid> i'm talking about the way i interact with the numbers, not the computer
2011-03-17T07:19:45  <sigh> well you only interact with them in two small places in the code, during paring and output
2011-03-17T07:20:11  <sigh> the rest of the time the computer is interacting with them, that's what you need to optimise for, and that's what I'm talking about
2011-03-17T07:21:25  <sigh> you can say x = BigInt("23123525605999100123500135"), but on disk you should store: 1001100100000100110001101010110111010100001101101001000111111000001010100111001100111
2011-03-17T07:25:00  <sigh> which means that if you are splitting that up into a vector, you are splitting on powers of 2
2011-03-17T07:27:27  <sigh> and I got side-tracked from my original point about negative integers -_-
2011-03-17T07:28:00  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-17T07:28:12  <antimatroid> you're making me realise i should just use a library
2011-03-17T07:28:34  <antimatroid> i don't expect people to need rationals over doubles, and if they do i doubt they'd break using 64bit ints
2011-03-17T07:28:51  <antimatroid> and if they break that, they can damn well work out how to use a library
2011-03-17T07:29:49  <sigh> haha
2011-03-17T07:30:31  <sigh> but seriously there is a reason why 2's complement is used for normal ints... so if you are making a bignum library, use it there as well
2011-03-17T07:30:58  <antimatroid> you've convinced me to stop making it :P
2011-03-17T07:31:10  <antimatroid>  but a mental note has been made if i ever change my mind
2011-03-17T07:31:16  <sigh> it's still a fun exercise :)
2011-03-17T07:31:24  <antimatroid> i can think of funner ones :P
2011-03-17T07:31:45  <antimatroid> i had a GROSS assignment question today
2011-03-17T07:32:20  <sigh> awww... treating negative numbers as 2-adic integers with an infinite string of leading 1s is just cool :P
2011-03-17T07:32:41  <antimatroid>  Let X be a set and C be the set of all ordered relations on X. C itself is ordered by ⊆ .
2011-03-17T07:32:41  <antimatroid> Show that R is a maximal element of C iﬀ R is a total order
2011-03-17T07:32:56  <antimatroid> grossest thing i've had to do all year (which isn't much, but it was gross)
2011-03-17T07:33:04  <sigh> haha
2011-03-17T07:34:06  <antimatroid> going backwards was pretty easy, but forwards, ergh

2011-03-17T08:42:30  <antimatroid> sigh: i wonder if you should reshuffle the spawn squares each iteration? otherwise people could keep track of the order

2011-03-17T09:04:27  <Stocha> hi there. What about spawning each bot TWO INSTANCES per game. So that you get a chance to cooperate with the other version of your bot ?
2011-03-17T09:05:18  <Stocha> While changing nothing else. You'll have to communicate through the movement of your ants alones. Or to not communicate.
2011-03-17T09:06:09  <amstan> Stocha: what would be the point of that?
2011-03-17T09:06:13  <antimatroid> ohh, i like this map
2011-03-17T09:06:16  <Stocha> Team play.
2011-03-17T09:06:23  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/xmVbp4xz
2011-03-17T09:06:29  <amstan> but the point of the game is not team play currently
2011-03-17T09:06:34  <Stocha> They are all asking for team play. And they probably are right.
2011-03-17T09:06:58  <Stocha> yeah, but it could be. And it doesn't involved anything tricky.
2011-03-17T09:07:06  <Stocha> So i made this suggestion.
2011-03-17T09:07:07  <antimatroid> Stocha: the original idea was to have each ant as a separate process, but it was infeasible due to computational requirements
2011-03-17T09:07:13  <Stocha> sure.
2011-03-17T09:07:21  <Stocha> but Two instances is not a problem.
2011-03-17T09:07:21  <antimatroid> one could do that, but at this point it's really just over complicating it
2011-03-17T09:07:40  <antimatroid> we already have issues with limited servers as is
2011-03-17T09:07:47  <antimatroid> i don't think we could handle it

2011-03-17T09:07:52  <Stocha> Yet you plan for a multiplayer game.
2011-03-17T09:08:01  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-590c4025.pool.mediaWays.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-17T09:08:01  <amstan> Stocha: what happens if one instance dies, what happens if both instances die? where do you get the double cpu for both instances
2011-03-17T09:08:07  <antimatroid> not my idea, but that will work alright
2011-03-17T09:08:16  <Stocha> Instead of it be 6 free bots, it could be 6 free bot with 2x3 programe
2011-03-17T09:08:41  <amstan> Stocha: sure, but such an addition probably won't make the results clearer
2011-03-17T09:08:51  <antimatroid> i think it'd be better to do another game later that somehow does communication
2011-03-17T09:08:56  <antimatroid> and actually base the game around it
2011-03-17T09:09:01  <Stocha> I don't see where there is a problem. It's the exact same multiplayer game. You simply state that each bot will have two copies.
2011-03-17T09:09:06  <amstan> you get far more information out of 6 focused bots instead of 3 bots that try to talk to themselves
2011-03-17T09:09:27  <Stocha> You wouldn't HAVE to communicate
2011-03-17T09:09:31  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, that's the plan
2011-03-17T09:09:32  <Stocha> but it would be an option.
2011-03-17T09:09:45  <amstan> Stocha: then how do you show in the scores that you got beat by your own bot?
2011-03-17T09:09:50  <amstan> Stocha: or what happens on a draw?
2011-03-17T09:10:02  <Stocha> how is that a problem ?
2011-03-17T09:10:02  <antimatroid> amstan: you would represent the players numbers the same
2011-03-17T09:10:19  <antimatroid> just pass each bot information about which are its ants
2011-03-17T09:10:22  <Stocha> Or you could even have one score for each copy of the bot.
2011-03-17T09:10:33  <Stocha> then have a rule to average it afterward.
2011-03-17T09:10:46  <Stocha> No
2011-03-17T09:10:55  <Stocha> the point is the bot do not know who his copy is.
2011-03-17T09:11:08  <Stocha> if you want to cooperate you'll have to get something IA like
2011-03-17T09:11:28  <antimatroid> that's not ai like, it's communication with pattern recognition
2011-03-17T09:11:33  <Stocha> if you don't want, you can tune your blind strategy knowing that another bot is using it.
2011-03-17T09:12:15  <Stocha> communication with pattern recognition is not ai like then. I don't speak english to well. I'm french. So it's hard for me to follow everything :p
2011-03-17T09:12:19  <antimatroid> it'd be fun to build a game around something like that where you actively tried to fool opponents into thinking you're them
2011-03-17T09:12:31  <Stocha> you could do that.
2011-03-17T09:12:55  <Stocha> If you can handle 4 player game or 6 player game, there nothing to change. Just tell the player they will have two copies.
2011-03-17T09:13:22  <antimatroid> we're already not able to play with as many players as we'd like with current server constraints
2011-03-17T09:14:03  <antimatroid> you also have to consider people testing on tcp
2011-03-17T09:14:05  <Stocha> Would challenger prefer having 2x2 copie, ar 1x4 bots. That's the question :p
2011-03-17T09:14:23  <antimatroid> i'd prefer 1
2011-03-17T09:14:45  <Stocha> from reading the forum, i though some would prefer two.
2011-03-17T09:14:57  <Stocha> and that it resurrect the initial idea. Wich was dropped.
2011-03-17T09:15:05  <Stocha> in a more feasible way.
2011-03-17T09:15:26  <Stocha> Also if there is this option, you need less complexity with fighting and such :p
2011-03-17T09:15:51  <antimatroid> why are you so against having an interesting battle resolution method?
2011-03-17T09:15:52  <Stocha> Because challenger will have plenty on their mind figuring out how to use the double copy thing.
2011-03-17T09:16:03  <Stocha> im' not against it.
2011-03-17T09:16:09  <Stocha> i just find it slippery at best.
2011-03-17T09:16:15  <antimatroid> slippery?
2011-03-17T09:16:32  <Stocha> yeah, you have a lot of option to make it complicated and uninterested.
2011-03-17T09:16:42  <Stocha> and very few way to knowing before hand.
2011-03-17T09:16:55  <Stocha> how many games sounded fun on paper, and just weren't ?
2011-03-17T09:17:23  <antimatroid> the same can be said for any plausible option
2011-03-17T09:17:25  <Stocha> How many encryption algorithme sounded strong, and had fatal flaw  ? :p

2011-03-17T09:18:03  <Stocha> More people can implement it. And participate. If it's simple.
2011-03-17T09:18:20  <antimatroid> the game has moved away from simplicity

2011-03-17T09:18:59  <antimatroid> using a paint algorithm it's pretty easy to move the closest ants to food and to your closest enemy, find shortest paths, count vision etc.

2011-03-17T09:19:20  <Stocha> I do not know if it's that easy.
2011-03-17T09:19:25  <Stocha> tron sounds easy.
2011-03-17T09:19:35  <Stocha> but still it was a challenge. With a clear winner.

2011-03-17T09:20:06  <antimatroid> i will admit tron was less trivial than it sounds, and this is far more complicated
2011-03-17T09:20:20  <Stocha> But you had more time to think about it.
2011-03-17T09:20:20  <antimatroid> what not to talk about planet wars? the winner was clearer for pw than tron
2011-03-17T09:20:25  <Stocha> so you may be right.
2011-03-17T09:20:48  <Stocha> but if you are, how to be sure that combat rule will solves this and not be still trivial when you really got into it ?
2011-03-17T09:20:55  <antimatroid> Stocha: I do like your water placement example
2011-03-17T09:21:08  <antimatroid> it would be cool to make both symmetric and asymmetric maps based off that
2011-03-17T09:21:40  <Stocha> The more diversity there is, the saffer we are that it will be boring or trivial to solve :p
2011-03-17T09:21:57  <Stocha> But the simplest it is, the more challenging for the bot maker.
2011-03-17T09:22:03  <antimatroid> option 1 actually makes it less likely to be trivial
2011-03-17T09:22:04  <Stocha> like tron, or go.
2011-03-17T09:22:19  <Stocha> it's not evident for me.
2011-03-17T09:22:30  <antimatroid> balance
2011-03-17T09:22:38  <Stocha> that option 1 make it less or more trivial or fun, or hard to solve. Or computer efficient.
2011-03-17T09:22:50  <Stocha> Or easy to implement, or fun to play with.
2011-03-17T09:22:50  <antimatroid> the efficiency is without a doubt
2011-03-17T09:23:15  <antimatroid> you have to iteratively do option 2, option 1 could can just go through counting each players enemies then kill of people who need to die
2011-03-17T09:23:20  <Stocha> it still less efficient than simple ant die if more than one on square :p
2011-03-17T09:23:34  <antimatroid> that's more boring than option 2
2011-03-17T09:23:47  <Stocha> I don't know how you can be so sure of that.
2011-03-17T09:23:58  <Stocha> it's like planet wars.
2011-03-17T09:24:13  <antimatroid> nobody wants to repeat the same game
2011-03-17T09:24:14  <Stocha> it does use 1:1. Maybe it is boring. But it was a challenge.
2011-03-17T09:24:23  <antimatroid> people have already tried to claim this is too much like pw (wtf right?)
2011-03-17T09:24:28  <Stocha> I fail to see how exploration and food gathering is the same game.
2011-03-17T09:24:40  <antimatroid> where did i say that?
2011-03-17T09:24:57  <Stocha> Some seems to imply it :p
2011-03-17T09:25:01  <antimatroid> do you understand what i mean when i say a painting algorithm?
2011-03-17T09:25:06  <Stocha> And that is some justification for complexity.
2011-03-17T09:25:24  <Stocha> wait a bit i have to go 'ill be back

2011-03-17T10:05:51  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: how do our maps form a vector space exactly?
2011-03-17T10:05:56  <stocha> i didn't saw the map you gave also
2011-03-17T10:06:01  <jmcarthur> oh you mean the coordinate system?
2011-03-17T10:06:07  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-17T10:06:19  <antimatroid> you get a basis pretty easily for which you can span the grid
2011-03-17T10:06:23  <jmcarthur> hmm, i never considered whether a wrapping coordinate system was a vector space
2011-03-17T10:06:59  <antimatroid> i haven't proved it yet, i'll try that over the weekend
2011-03-17T10:07:14  <stocha> would it beiing a vector space help making stronger bots ?
2011-03-17T10:07:19  <antimatroid> no
2011-03-17T10:07:25  <antimatroid> it's just a cool side result
2011-03-17T10:07:50  <antimatroid> stocha: i'm almost done making symmetric random carve maps
2011-03-17T10:08:11  <antimatroid> (it wasn't too hard to change my current code, i'm not that fast :P)
2011-03-17T10:09:02  <stocha> so were talking about how a painting algorithm would solve food gathering ?
2011-03-17T10:09:47  <stocha> One question for you  does all shapes have the same ant output, whenever there is one food given at random between each empty ground ?
2011-03-17T10:10:42  <stocha> Or how many ant per empty ground (clear of ennemy) do you need in order to maximize your food gathering ?

2011-03-17T10:13:11  <stocha> Let suppose you have a territory with only a three square narrow corridor to access it. What shape of ground do you need in order to make it impenetrable and still have positif ant output, against a foe unlimited in number ?
2011-03-17T10:13:54  <stocha> How many free ground do you need for each shape. And how many full time ant gatherer. How should they move exactly ?

2011-03-17T10:17:05  <stocha> There is a lot of talk about "ant blocking" with some fighting rule
2011-03-17T10:17:26  <stocha> that's only considering "static" blocking. You put some ant, they block and never dies.
2011-03-17T10:17:36  <stocha> but there is also the concept of dynamic blocking.
2011-03-17T10:17:53  <stocha> You put some ant, and they do die, but at a slow maximum rate.
2011-03-17T10:18:04  <stocha> so you can replace them
2011-03-17T10:18:39  <stocha> and still block the ennemy at a cost of a litle bit of regeneration. But if the area blocked is big enougth, that's still blocking
2011-03-17T10:20:10  <antimatroid> VERY preliminary: http://pastebin.com/jZSg4duD
2011-03-17T10:20:48  <jmcarthur> it being a vector space could possible make a simpler API or lead to useful functions on the coordinate system
2011-03-17T10:20:52  <jmcarthur> *possibly
2011-03-17T10:21:35  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: didn't realise that, I just thought it was really cool :P
2011-03-17T10:21:50  <antimatroid> my friend thinks the set of them may form a matroid

2011-03-17T10:23:16  <antimatroid> Stocha_: how did you do your random walks?
2011-03-17T10:23:28  <Stocha_> you pick up a point at random
2011-03-17T10:23:32  <antimatroid> i was worried about walking around in already carved sace for too long
2011-03-17T10:23:37  <Stocha_> on a blank water map
2011-03-17T10:23:48  <antimatroid> so i've just been carving randomly out of available walls on the edge
2011-03-17T10:23:52  <Stocha_> then you pick up a direction at random
2011-03-17T10:24:07  <antimatroid> are you letting it walk around on land?
2011-03-17T10:24:11  <Stocha_> (from the 4 ant dir)
2011-03-17T10:24:16  <Stocha_> yeah
2011-03-17T10:24:18  <antimatroid> yeah i get that
2011-03-17T10:24:22  <Stocha_> it walk on land and water
2011-03-17T10:24:32  <Stocha_> i can give you a code example
2011-03-17T10:24:35  <Stocha_> but it's dead simple
2011-03-17T10:24:45  <Stocha_> that's about it in fact :p
2011-03-17T10:24:46  <antimatroid> i'm pretty much assuming i constantly have ants on every boundary land square
2011-03-17T10:24:53  <antimatroid> i know how you're doing it
2011-03-17T10:25:01  <jmcarthur> if you demonstrate that it is in fact a vector space, i will probably pull in the vector-space package for the haskell library :)
2011-03-17T10:25:13  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i plan to do that over the weekend
2011-03-17T10:25:17  <antimatroid> it has to be done now
2011-03-17T10:25:42  <antimatroid> in fact i could probably give it a go now
2011-03-17T10:25:45  <antimatroid> hold on
2011-03-17T10:26:07  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure it's a vector space
2011-03-17T10:26:10  <Stocha_> so basically the random walk is an ant moving randomly, and making ground as it walks on water and already ground :p
2011-03-17T10:26:32  <jmcarthur> wouldn't it need to be continuous?
2011-03-17T10:26:36  <Stocha_> you stop when you have enougth grund
2011-03-17T10:26:49  <jmcarthur> or maybe rational at least
2011-03-17T10:26:55  <Stocha_> vector space need to be continuous ?
2011-03-17T10:27:12  <jmcarthur> well no, but i think it might have to be... not integers in this case
2011-03-17T10:27:31  <antimatroid> hmmm, not a field for scalar multiplication you mena?
2011-03-17T10:27:41  <antimatroid> cause clearly Z isn't a field :\
2011-03-17T10:27:44  <antimatroid> hmmm you might be right
2011-03-17T10:28:25  <antimatroid> it must meet the definition of something i swear
2011-03-17T10:28:30  <jmcarthur> the scalar is supposed to be a field isn't it?
2011-03-17T10:28:31  <antimatroid> it's too perfect not to
2011-03-17T10:28:41  <antimatroid> yeah, has to be a field
2011-03-17T10:28:41  <jmcarthur> ah you just said
2011-03-17T10:29:09  <jmcarthur> we can start simple and work up
2011-03-17T10:29:31  <jmcarthur> we know the scalar is a monoid, at least
2011-03-17T10:29:37  <antimatroid> well you have the set of squares, then an element is an index, and you can add/subtract them easily
2011-03-17T10:30:00  <jmcarthur> the scalar isn't a group
2011-03-17T10:30:06  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-03-17T10:30:10  <jmcarthur> and additive group maybe
2011-03-17T10:30:15  <jmcarthur> but not a multiplicative group
2011-03-17T10:30:19  <jmcarthur> *an
2011-03-17T10:30:42  <antimatroid> yeah things aren't looking amazing
2011-03-17T10:30:51  <jmcarthur> so that's probably as far as we can take that
2011-03-17T10:31:46  <jmcarthur> it is probably an affine space
2011-03-17T10:32:31  <needsch> is the ants viewer supposed to work already?
2011-03-17T10:32:51  <antimatroid> try to reason this for me: no matter what dimensions and rowt, colt, you always have finite order, but not necessarily the ability to form a basis, only once you meet my requirements for tessellation
2011-03-17T10:33:25  <antimatroid> i think it's fairly intuitive that that's iff
2011-03-17T10:33:55  <antimatroid> well not reason, it's obviously true, but is that interesting at all?
2011-03-17T10:33:59  <jmcarthur> what are your requirements for tessellation again?
2011-03-17T10:34:20  <antimatroid> players = lcm(rows/gcd(rows, rowt), .)
2011-03-17T10:34:55  <antimatroid> that's just the order of the cartesian product of the orders of row and col

2011-03-17T10:45:32  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i believe we have a module, at least, but where the scalar is a pair of values and scalar multiplication is just ring multiplication. our maps are a cartesian product of congruence classes.
2011-03-17T10:46:36  <jmcarthur> for an m×n map, we have  ℤ/mℤ × ℤ/nℤ
2011-03-17T10:46:38  <antimatroid> ahh, i sort of figured the congruence thing
2011-03-17T10:46:54  <jmcarthur> if m and n are prime, we might even have a vector space.
2011-03-17T10:46:59  <antimatroid> i said to my friend before i think it's isomorphic to congruence
2011-03-17T10:47:00  <jmcarthur> in any case, it's not the vector space we wanted

This would allow me to reuse the JavaScript source for the canvas visualizer, the applet and an offline visualizer in a jar file.

2011-03-17T13:12:59  <Frontier> The downside is, that as a pure ECMAScript implementation it does not offer JavaScript functions like alert, setTimeout or document.createElement. It is a lot of work to implement all the used functions to simulate a browser environment. The benefit is the complete reuse of code written for the web visualizer, no additional work for an offline visualizer and a faster IE 8 experience.

2011-03-17T13:19:38  <Frontier> amstan: There is a working IE version, it is just slow.
2011-03-17T13:20:03  <Frontier> And I thought: "What if the JavaScript was executed inside the applet?"
2011-03-17T13:20:06  <amstan> well.. how slow?
2011-03-17T13:21:20  <Frontier> see for yourself: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer.php?game_id=2&java=true#visualizer
2011-03-17T13:23:07  <Frontier> (i capped the cpu usage at 50%, so it can easily run twice as fast)
2011-03-17T13:24:43  <amstan> oh man, applets really don't agree with me
2011-03-17T13:27:02  <Frontier> it is close to a slideshow @100% cpu and a real slideshow @50%. if you look at the numbers i posted above you'll see why. 0.6 ms per call * 2 draw calls * 1000 ants / 50% cpu = 2.4 seconds per frame
2011-03-17T13:28:29  <amstan> Frontier: yeah, applets are a no go for me
2011-03-17T13:28:32  <amstan> they never were
2011-03-17T13:29:27  <Frontier> amstan: They alway feel out of place in a browser window.
2011-03-17T13:29:57  <Frontier> Yet they provide the whole Java framework including a JavaScript engine ^^
2011-03-17T13:30:05  <McLeopold> Frontier: what about javascript controlling flash?
2011-03-17T13:30:07  <amstan> no, like they're not loading at all

2011-03-17T13:30:44  <Frontier> McLeopold: Depends on how fast LiveConnect is with Flash.

2011-03-17T13:35:09  <amstan> IE always has to come ruin the fun
2011-03-17T13:35:47  <McLeopold> Frontier: http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/
2011-03-17T13:36:49  <Frontier> McLeopold: from the flash-canvas homepage: "Doing something simple like a moveTo and lineTo would result in at a very minimum 8 separate levels of indirection."
2011-03-17T13:37:11  <Frontier> ... well I have my doubts about the performance compared to what I have now
2011-03-17T13:39:06  <Frontier> I used Explorer Canvas. It had about the same performance in some cases as the applet, but It lacked important functions like text output and generated a vector graphic on the fly which works differently from a bitmap where you can just draw over old parts. in a vector graphic the draw commands actually 'add up' over time and require a full clear now and then
2011-03-17T13:40:25  <Frontier> I didn't look into flash back then, because I have no experience with flash at all, but have a solid Java background.
2011-03-17T13:41:30  <Frontier> Zannick: Were you testing in IE? I might need to change something to make a link to the Java download appear.
2011-03-17T13:41:50  <Zannick> Frontier: chromium
2011-03-17T13:42:07  <Zannick> er, chrome
2011-03-17T13:42:30  <Frontier> Zannick: then I don't care, you can use the 10x faster html canvas :p
2011-03-17T13:42:38  <Zannick> yay :)

2011-03-17T14:13:09  <janzert> ahh
2011-03-17T14:18:24  <Frontier> McLeopold: You need to draw the map background as one big rect and sorta 'run-length' process the water in every row. If you extend the water rects to the right as far as possible you produce far less draw calls.
2011-03-17T14:19:48  <Frontier> The next omptimization is what you do in 3D rendering as well: Order objects by state. In our case we would draw all red squares in one go and so on to reduce the calls to .fillStyle

2011-03-17T16:11:14  <janzert> corridors and rooms sort of
2011-03-17T16:13:23  <janzert> it probably requires more space per player than the current map types to work well though

2011-03-17T16:15:36  <antimatroid> i like it
2011-03-17T16:16:08  <janzert> with the start positions stuck way down at the end of a hall?
2011-03-17T16:16:26  <janzert> seems pointless
2011-03-17T16:16:59  <antimatroid> yeah it is a bit
2011-03-17T16:17:07  <janzert> the first 9 moves are basically forced
2011-03-17T16:17:12  <antimatroid> i could randomly walk in all 4 directions at the start
2011-03-17T16:17:57  <janzert> not sure how the best way to handle it is
2011-03-17T16:18:06  <antimatroid> i think that'd be good
2011-03-17T16:18:20  <antimatroid> then you could have labyrinth maps with 4 choices on the first turn
2011-03-17T16:18:22  <janzert> maybe the start position shouldn't necessarily be the start of the random walk?
2011-03-17T16:19:00  <janzert> instead choose the start position after the walk is completed
2011-03-17T16:19:23  <antimatroid> then you need to check conditions of the start locations
2011-03-17T16:19:38  <janzert> making sure the start has at least 3 directions open to it
2011-03-17T16:19:42  <janzert> yep
2011-03-17T16:20:06  <antimatroid> i'm going to try multiple walks
2011-03-17T16:20:11  <antimatroid> i think that might work well anyway
2011-03-17T16:20:45  <janzert> one thing is that dead ends seem to be pretty rare on these maps
2011-03-17T16:20:52  <antimatroid> oh, with predicting maps, in the final tournament a bot can't store information across games, how could they even guess?
2011-03-17T16:21:14  <janzert> the stocha post?
2011-03-17T16:21:24  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-17T16:21:32  <janzert> I don't think predicting maps is the big part, it's predicting where the next food will spawn
2011-03-17T16:21:37  <antimatroid> i could reseed the random walk every once in a while
2011-03-17T16:21:41  <antimatroid> that would give more dead ends
2011-03-17T16:22:06  <antimatroid> oh, my idea for that was to re order the land squares every time we go through them
2011-03-17T16:22:33  <antimatroid> if you can predict that by the end of game then good on you
2011-03-17T16:22:36  <janzert> if you're doing it based on the RNG that just gives the bot more RNG states to work with
2011-03-17T16:23:04  <janzert> making it even quicker for them to be able to make accurate predictions
2011-03-17T16:23:21  <janzert> the right fix is fortunately very easy
2011-03-17T16:23:30  <janzert> use a cryptographically strong rng

2011-03-17T20:30:39  <antimatroid> hmmm, i could just pass my number of elements in dimension n+1 as a parameter to the constructer

2011-03-17T20:31:07  <sigh> hehe
2011-03-17T20:31:13  <antimatroid> did you use a template thing or parameter?
2011-03-17T20:31:27  <antimatroid> the template doesn't allow me to write general functions for n-players
2011-03-17T20:31:42  <sigh> I did the template thing
2011-03-17T20:32:04  <antimatroid> it's a bit gross doing it as a parameter

2011-03-17T20:41:18  <sixthgear> hi sorry we rescheduled, it was a last minute thing, and noone was interested at the posted time
2011-03-17T20:41:58  <sixthgear> it wasnt even a programming challenge anyway :) we were going to see how bad (or good?) programmers really are at 3d modelling
2011-03-17T20:42:32  <sixthgear> ie. announce topic, 30 mins to download a modelling app and make the subject
2011-03-17T20:42:35  <jbroman> sixthgear: I made a cube once.
2011-03-17T20:42:58  <sigh> what type of challenge was it?
2011-03-17T20:42:58  <sixthgear> we expected the results to be hilariously awful
2011-03-17T20:43:34  <sixthgear> if you guys are interested in that i'll let you know if we reschedule, i made it too last minute i think
2011-03-17T20:44:34  <Frontier> i once modeled a boar as a half-life deathmatch character with the weapon mounted on its back. - lol
2011-03-17T20:44:48  <sixthgear> :) most of us have never even opened blender
2011-03-17T20:45:02  <sigh> I don't even know what that is :D
2011-03-17T20:45:06  <sixthgear> hahah
2011-03-17T20:45:07  <Frontier> blender... that's another story, i used milkshape 3d
2011-03-17T20:45:15  <sixthgear> ooh havent heard of that one
2011-03-17T20:45:23  <sixthgear> i was going to use/suggest wings3d
2011-03-17T20:45:28  <Frontier> blender is so unintuitive i need to read a book before i can use that
2011-03-17T20:46:53  <Frontier> I never heard of wings3d. is it a new application?
2011-03-17T20:47:22  <sixthgear> no its been around for awhile i think, when i tried it, it was pretty damn intuitive
2011-03-17T20:47:28  <Frontier> (then again my experiments were 10 years ago)
2011-03-17T20:48:15  <Frontier> Back then I also tried to compose music using ModPlug Tracker.
2011-03-17T20:48:45  <Frontier> That would be a fun challenge: compose some good music
2011-03-17T20:48:46  <sixthgear> ok so dont laugh, but this http://i.imgur.com/xFfHw.png was after playing around with wings for 10 minutes or so, not having any other modelling experience.
2011-03-17T20:49:08  <Frontier> this is so ... reddit Oo
2011-03-17T20:49:48  <sixthgear> modplug tracker nice
2011-03-17T20:49:56  <sixthgear> i forget the names of the trackers i used in the 90s

2011-03-17T20:53:28  <sigh> i suppose you could do it though, boost does some amazing magic
2011-03-17T20:53:40  <amstan> then he proceeded to use a while loop
2011-03-17T20:54:02  <sigh> amstan: why didn't he think he could use for?
2011-03-17T20:54:03  <Frontier> antimatroid: Walter Bright already wrote his own compiler and some people startet to write kernels with it.

2011-03-17T21:01:08  <sigh> yeah, but creating a function for a simple loop is a bit silly
2011-03-17T21:01:20  <sigh> I mean in something like c++
2011-03-17T21:01:46  <antimatroid> like i can define operator(it's really hard to put a character to represent anything here)() in c++ then use the operator
2011-03-17T21:02:03  <sigh> you can do that in haskell
2011-03-17T21:02:09  <antimatroid> in my ideal c++ i could also overload the way an operator is used and the precedence of them etc. and use ANYTHING as an operator,
2011-03-17T21:03:14  <sigh> in haskell operators are no different from other functions
