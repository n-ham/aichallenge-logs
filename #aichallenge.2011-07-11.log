2011-07-11T07:04:28  <jmcarthur> that wasn't a netsplit. it was a disconnect.
2011-07-11T07:04:51  <mcstar> no
2011-07-11T07:05:04  <mcstar> they were netsplits, on #lisp too
2011-07-11T07:05:21  <jmcarthur> well, then i must have missed it, because i was disconnected
2011-07-11T07:05:40  <mcstar> jmcarthur: care to explain what that is?
2011-07-11T07:05:51  <jmcarthur> or maybe that whole server went down and it just looked like a netsplit to everybody else
2011-07-11T07:06:06  <jmcarthur> netsplits are an artifact of irc being overengineered
2011-07-11T07:06:45  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure of the details, but every once in a while a server or two will become disjoint from the rest of them, so it will be as though there are two or three of every channel, with different sets of people in each one
2011-07-11T07:07:07  <jmcarthur> then they merge back up after the split is over
2011-07-11T07:07:57  <mcstar> "will become disjoint" is this planned? or happens for some outside reason?

2011-07-11T07:11:45  <jmcarthur> but really, it's just a server-side mechanism being inappropriately exposed to the clients, as far as i can tell
2011-07-11T07:12:22  <jmcarthur> need multiple servers? fine, as long as i'm not aware of it...
2011-07-11T07:12:29  <sigh> jmcarthur: what you prefer it do instead?
2011-07-11T07:12:51  <jmcarthur> sigh: other kinds of web services don't seem to have the same problem. should do whatever they do
2011-07-11T07:13:41  <mcstar> so, for example the server im directly connecting to(gibson) can hand me over to another when such event occurs?
2011-07-11T07:13:46  <sigh> fair enough, but that's an architectural issue, your last statement made it sound like a ux issue :P
2011-07-11T07:14:25  <sigh> *ui
2011-07-11T07:14:53  <jmcarthur> it's an architectural issue being inappropriately exposed in the client-side interface
2011-07-11T07:15:16  <sigh> I don't think you can avoid exposing it without changing the architecture
2011-07-11T07:15:19  <mcstar> yeah, but if the above thing happens, then id like to be notified of this
2011-07-11T07:15:22  <jmcarthur> right
2011-07-11T07:15:46  <jmcarthur> but it's not just the architecture at fault. it's the specification itself (which demands that it be in the interface)
2011-07-11T07:15:58  <sigh> ah, fair enough
2011-07-11T07:16:31  <jmcarthur> mcstar: you won't usually be handed over to another server unless the server you are on forcibly disconnected you
2011-07-11T07:17:00  <jmcarthur> mcstar: just a plain netsplit will simply leave you stranded in smaller channels, sometimes you being the only person in them
2011-07-11T07:17:24  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-11T07:17:38  <mcstar> well, thx for the explanation :)
2011-07-11T07:17:58  <jmcarthur> it looks like everybody leaves, but they actually just keep right on talking without you
2011-07-11T07:18:14  <jmcarthur> that's when you get the short end of the stick, of course
2011-07-11T07:18:30  <mcstar> i think ive never experienced a netsplit
2011-07-11T07:18:31  <jmcarthur> more commonly it just looks like some smaller group of people leave
2011-07-11T07:18:45  <jmcarthur> yeah freenode has been more stable this year than in years past, i've noticed
