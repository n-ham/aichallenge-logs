2012-04-24T10:03:57  <mcstar> it doesnt matter how much time is spent on developing the game
2012-04-24T10:03:59  <mleise> Ants wasn't really straight forward, but I think we reiterated on that just enough times to make it good.
2012-04-24T10:04:10  <mcstar> what matters is ppl to not know what it is going to be
2012-04-24T10:04:34  <mleise> hmm... yeah those beta testers had a good head start *g*
2012-04-24T10:05:03  <mcstar> for example, it is very easy to build an asteroids engine, and sy with time on his hand can develop a bot right away
2012-04-24T10:05:44  <mcstar> so the organizers should discuss the next game with a limited group, and exclude them from the contest

2012-04-24T10:12:00  <mcstar> ah
2012-04-24T10:26:31  <amstan> really, people are getting upset over the 2 week period? i would think they would get upset over the ammount of time we're taking
2012-04-24T10:26:43  <amstan> antimatroid, mleise ^
2012-04-24T10:28:14  <mcstar> (i think they would get upset if bugs are left in the game, since 2 weeks arent enough to shake them out)
2012-04-24T10:28:43  <mleise> what mcstar said.

2012-04-24T10:29:14  <mleise> Even ants had rough edges and people said something along the lines of "I would have expected better quality from Google"
2012-04-24T10:29:33  <mleise> well.. the expectations were a bit high
2012-04-24T10:29:57  <mleise> we are not Google, have no QA department and so on

2012-04-24T10:30:51  <mleise> amstan: my point is that a game is quickly implemented. it may be done in a single day. all the work around that is taking time.
2012-04-24T10:30:53  <mcstar> amstan: what about my suggestion of doing it privately?(though that would rule out asteroids pretty much)
2012-04-24T10:32:04  <mleise> it sounds to me like you are planning to do everything in 2 weeks, besides the bit of game implementation that's actually the fastest to do
2012-04-24T10:32:41  <mleise> I'm thinking of the Planet Wars server code for example. That were maybe 2 screen pages of code.
2012-04-24T10:32:45  <amstan> mcstar: we could still do asteroids, but we'll probably make our own thing, so i hope it'll be different enough
2012-04-24T10:33:26  <amstan> the only thing i want to avoid is having the game done before the rest of the framework
2012-04-24T10:33:37  <amstan> last time we started with ants first, then we worried about the framework
2012-04-24T10:33:55  <amstan> so all the time that we were working on the framework, people got a chance to play ants
2012-04-24T10:34:27  <mleise> amstan: hehe, I'm sure it will include 'drifting' objects and maybe homing missiles and a "fixed frame rate". with these assumptions you can write a month worth of collision detection and other code
2012-04-24T10:34:33  <amstan> mcstar: i'm  not sure how private will work
2012-04-24T10:34:42  <amstan> mleise: point
2012-04-24T10:35:35  <mleise> ok, so how can the framework be finalized when the game is not there?
2012-04-24T10:35:52  <amstan> we'll just implement a dummy game
2012-04-24T10:35:58  <amstan> like who picks the highest number
2012-04-24T10:35:59  <mleise> starter bots?
2012-04-24T10:36:09  <mleise> how-tos?
2012-04-24T10:36:16  <mleise> website design?
2012-04-24T10:36:18  <mcstar> no, just something for trueskill i guess
2012-04-24T10:36:25  <mcstar> maybe a PRNG
2012-04-24T10:36:29  <amstan> starter bots are not a problem if they come after launch
2012-04-24T10:36:29  <mcstar> XD
2012-04-24T10:36:34  <amstan> how tos the same
2012-04-24T10:36:57  <amstan> website design, we can do that fairly quickly as well
2012-04-24T10:37:19  <mleise> ok, you are in charge :)
2012-04-24T10:37:22  <amstan> mcstar: yeah, exactly, we just need bots in like 3 languages to test trueskill and the compilation pipeline
2012-04-24T10:37:32  <amstan> mleise: aarossig did the last design in about a day
2012-04-24T10:38:08  <mleise> I spend weeks discussing the interface and file formats for Ants with McLeopold :p
2012-04-24T10:38:39  <mleise> hey... btw. I forgot one thing: who writes the visualizer _after_ release?

2012-04-24T10:39:31  <amstan> we should have a lot of this stuff beforehand, but that means we offer an unfair advantage to some people
2012-04-24T10:39:58  <mleise> that's right and why mcstar proposed a private development phase
2012-04-24T10:40:26  <amstan> but how would that work? all the code is open source
2012-04-24T10:40:42  <amstan> and that would mean not allowing anyone in the private circle to compete
2012-04-24T10:40:49  <mleise> i didn't consider that ^^
2012-04-24T10:40:59  <mcstar> i said that exactly, and i think it is reasonable
2012-04-24T10:41:09  <mleise> you *could* host the code on a private server for that time
2012-04-24T10:41:27  <amstan> we could even do private github actually
2012-04-24T10:41:38  <amstan> hmm
2012-04-24T10:41:44  <mleise> sure, just a matter of what is cheaper/easier
2012-04-24T10:41:51  <amstan> it's $7/month
2012-04-24T10:42:18  <mleise> e.g. aichallenge.org isn't doing much at the moment
2012-04-24T10:42:41  <mleise> it is like planting potatoes in one year and wheat in another
2012-04-24T10:42:49  <mcstar> o.O
2012-04-24T10:42:57  <mleise> my allegories suck, i know :p
2012-04-24T10:43:07  <amstan> lol
2012-04-24T10:43:59  <mleise> all i wanted to say is, if the server is running anyway, it can be used for a git repository in between games
2012-04-24T10:44:20  <amstan> sure, but that means no wiki or issues
2012-04-24T10:44:32  <mcstar> on a sidenote, it would be interesting to choose the asteroids game, maybe this could be the first time, that some machine learning alg. or similar thing could actually win
2012-04-24T10:45:31  <mleise> amstan: but, you think this is a viable solution in general? (the private development phase and exclusion from participation)
2012-04-24T10:45:40  <amstan> i'm not sure
2012-04-24T10:45:55  <amstan> we need to have a meeting sometime and decide all of this
2012-04-24T10:47:15  <mcstar> you could consider other similar contests to
2012-04-24T10:47:17  <mcstar> o
2012-04-24T10:47:26  <mcstar> what do they do? release early, before the launch?
2012-04-24T10:47:50  <mcstar> or they dont leak at all?
2012-04-24T10:48:00  <mcstar> (i think the latter, but it is a guess)
2012-04-24T10:52:50  <antimatroid> i for the first time just read mcstar's name as McStar
2012-04-24T10:52:54  <antimatroid> rather than mc-star
2012-04-24T10:52:56  <antimatroid> like mc-hammer
2012-04-24T10:53:03  <antimatroid> mind blown
2012-04-24T10:53:15  <antimatroid> which is it meant to be?
2012-04-24T10:53:23  <mcstar> what a revelation
2012-04-24T10:53:30  <mcstar> antimatroid: like this: mcstar
2012-04-24T10:53:42  <mcstar> oh, you cant hear me
2012-04-24T10:53:48  <antimatroid> WHAT?
2012-04-24T10:54:05  <mcstar> emseestar
2012-04-24T10:54:13  <antimatroid> i think you will find few volunteers to help with exclusion from competing
2012-04-24T10:54:21  <hkraal> It would be great if the framework count's actual cpu cycles opposed to what was done with the ants, those timeouts where quite annoying altought the servers where doing fine :)
2012-04-24T10:54:30  <antimatroid> hkraal: it's too hard
2012-04-24T10:54:40  <antimatroid> we've wanted to and looked into it in the past
2012-04-24T10:54:48  <antimatroid> and always concluded it'd too hard cross-platform and cross-language
2012-04-24T10:54:52  <antimatroid> it's*
2012-04-24T10:55:21  <mleise> amstan: GitHub's issue tracking isn't very sophisticated. A Google search brought up this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_Bug_Tracker With a plugin it integrates with both git and GitHub. Maybe if someone is familiar with any of those bug trackers it would be quickly set up.
2012-04-24T10:55:49  <mcstar> where?
2012-04-24T10:55:52  <antimatroid> i do like the idea of giving bots a buffer per game
2012-04-24T10:56:02  <antimatroid> like you can use up to 2 seconds in total from going over
2012-04-24T10:56:35  <mleise> antimatroid: that works? it sounds neat
2012-04-24T10:56:55  <antimatroid> what works?
2012-04-24T10:57:01  <antimatroid> a buffer? there's no reason why it wouldn't
2012-04-24T10:57:04  <mleise> your time buffer  idea
2012-04-24T10:57:20  <antimatroid> it's been mentioned in the past not by me
2012-04-24T10:57:33  <mleise> and when you use up less time you get back buffer time, till the 2 secs are full again

2012-04-24T10:58:37  <mcstar> (and send the bot the total available time each turn)
2012-04-24T10:59:27  <mleise> that could stretch the game quite a bit, if there is alway just one bot using more than the others
2012-04-24T10:59:27  <mcstar> anyway, a bot timing out is bot not worth having

2012-04-24T11:01:44  <hkraal> mcstar: the problem was in the virtualisation layer. The time you had for your turn was moving forward even no cpu cycles where used. This is known as ready time (the time that the VM spends waiting on a cpu cycle to become available)
2012-04-24T11:02:29  <amstan> for wall time vs cpu time both must be used
2012-04-24T11:02:35  <amstan> you can't just use cpu time
2012-04-24T11:02:41  <amstan> or else one can just sleep(100000)
2012-04-24T11:03:01  <hkraal> antimatroid: if you would spin off a bot in his own thread you can use the OS information from your main thread to calulate its real usage if I'm not mistaken?
2012-04-24T11:04:04  <mcstar> if i recall correctly, the winner used java, and that runs on a vm i heard
2012-04-24T11:04:11  <hkraal> amstan: very true :)
2012-04-24T11:04:26  * antimatroid knows almost nothing about how computors actually work
2012-04-24T11:04:30  <antimatroid> including languages etc.
2012-04-24T11:04:38  <antimatroid> i just pass it instructions :)
2012-04-24T11:04:53  <mcstar> if ppl massively time out, the organizers can always just raise the timelimit
2012-04-24T11:05:06  <antimatroid> there's limitations there
2012-04-24T11:05:08  <mcstar> but that didnt happen, some ppl timed out only
2012-04-24T11:05:08  <antimatroid> resource wise
2012-04-24T11:05:51  <hkraal> Well short version: VM requests CPU cycles from its host. If the host has none the VM just has to wait (= Ready time), meanwhile the time does move forward but its not equally fast as the cpu
2012-04-24T11:06:53  <mcstar> why wouldnt it get cpu time? (with a default nice level)
2012-04-24T11:07:09  * mcstar not a vm expert or anything
2012-04-24T11:07:33  <hkraal> because the schedular of the virtualisation technology used some cycles for its own or has trouble finding a real CPU to put your thread on
2012-04-24T11:08:26  <mcstar> how often does this happen?
2012-04-24T11:08:33  <mcstar> what is te resolution of this scheduling?
2012-04-24T11:08:38  <hkraal> but the fact that there are none cpu cycles availible doesn't mean time doesn't go forward :)
2012-04-24T11:09:49  <hkraal> so if you limit a turn to 1s. In theory you could get anywhere between 0 and max cpu cycles :)
2012-04-24T11:10:01  <mcstar> in theory i dont care
2012-04-24T11:10:07  <mcstar> what about in practice?
2012-04-24T11:11:22  <hkraal> it would be more average. With the ants I knew I had 500 ms calculation time. So after each ant I checked how much time was left, if it was < 100 ms I would stop calculating
2012-04-24T11:12:09  <hkraal> but if at 101ms remaining there is no CPU cycle availible for 102ms? then my bot would instantly time out
2012-04-24T11:12:23  <hkraal> *for the duration of 102 ms
2012-04-24T11:12:58  <hkraal> But it isn't a fair limit since I couldn't do anything in those 102ms because I had no cpu cycles left..
2012-04-24T11:13:26  <mcstar> im quite sceptical about that the vm cant schedule some work on the system for 100ms
2012-04-24T11:13:31  <mcstar> thats a huge lag
2012-04-24T11:13:47  <hkraal> mcstar: is very normal with VMware
2012-04-24T11:13:57  <mcstar> vmware?
2012-04-24T11:14:01  <mcstar> wait
2012-04-24T11:14:08  <hkraal> ?
2012-04-24T11:14:27  <mcstar> we were taling about virtual machines, executing some bytecode, not an os virtualization
2012-04-24T11:14:30  <mcstar> talking*
2012-04-24T11:15:31  <mcstar> so? why are you talking about vmware?
2012-04-24T11:16:11  <hkraal> Because thats where (a part of) the servers where running on with the Ants challenge
2012-04-24T11:16:27  <mcstar> where?
2012-04-24T11:16:48  <hkraal> The company I work for sponsored them
2012-04-24T11:18:02  <mcstar> where -> were
2012-04-24T11:18:05  <mcstar> pls
2012-04-24T11:19:28  <hkraal> Ah like that. When the Ants started the hardware wasn't in production yet, it is now so those boxed can't be used without impact :)
2012-04-24T11:20:15  <hkraal> or did you just made a comment on my spelling? Me is getting confused :+
2012-04-24T11:20:21  <mcstar> yes
2012-04-24T11:20:54  <hkraal> ah srry :)
2012-04-24T11:22:55  <mcstar> hkraal: but if you were talking about os virtualization, than that affects all languages equally
2012-04-24T11:24:09  <hkraal> It does, but that doesn't make time alone a good measurer :)
2012-04-24T11:25:18  <mcstar> just use the VM's cpu time as real time
2012-04-24T11:25:28  <mcstar> (but i guess you have no access to that)
2012-04-24T11:27:42  <hkraal> You can't trust the CPU time, that's just my point :)
2012-04-24T11:28:36  <mcstar> hkraal: cpu time of the VM process on the physical machine
2012-04-24T11:28:54  <hkraal> That would be a hard one yeah :)
2012-04-24T11:29:55  <hkraal> It would be possible with lower virtualisation techniques (OpenVZ/Virtuozzo) but not others like VMware
2012-04-24T11:30:40  <hkraal> But Linux has it's tools to measure real CPU time, but the bot must have it's own process ID to be able to measure it
2012-04-24T11:35:38  <antimatroid> i don't think my bot timed out once during ants comp
2012-04-24T11:35:41  <antimatroid> and i'm kind of timeouts
2012-04-24T11:35:59  <antimatroid> i was pretty happy aboot that
2012-04-24T11:38:15  <hkraal> hehe :)
2012-04-24T11:38:27  <hkraal> Well, time to close the day 0/
2012-04-24T11:55:13  <mleise> OpenVZ has the issue, that it takes away the layer of virtual memory
2012-04-24T11:55:41  <mleise> A Java process that would use 1GB virtual and 20MB physical is suddenly just using 1GB memory
2012-04-24T11:56:22  <mleise> It's really messy with all the software today that is written to use lots of virtual memory
2012-04-24T11:57:30  <mleise> The first Ants beta ran on an OpenVZ system and we had trouble spawning two Java bots simultaneously without running out of memory ... lol
2012-04-24T11:58:46  <mleise> of course we were able to remedy the situation a bit by passing flags to the JVM, but it wasn't a good solution

2012-04-24T13:30:31  <antimatroid> what's a sequence of sets of real numbers whose union is the set of real numbers but each set only has a finite number of rational numbers?
2012-04-24T13:34:17  * pairofdice hides from what looks like math
2012-04-24T13:35:19  <mcstar> that is easy
2012-04-24T13:36:09  <mcstar> i imagine you can imagine fixed precision numbers with increasing precision
2012-04-24T13:37:30  <mcstar> well, you have to cover the whole number line somehow, but each set has to have finite number of rationals, hm
2012-04-24T13:37:53  <mcstar> antimatroid: what is your question? give an example? or is this a known construction and want the name of it?
2012-04-24T13:38:35  <antimatroid> i have a measure on the borel sigma-algebra of R and need to show it's sigma-finite
2012-04-24T13:38:50  <antimatroid> the measure just gives you the number of rational numbers in a subset
2012-04-24T13:39:19  <antimatroid> and sigma-finite is basically just that there's a sequence whose union is the entire space but each set in the sequence has finite measure
2012-04-24T13:39:38  <antimatroid> i don't see how it's going to work though :|
2012-04-24T13:39:52  <antimatroid> you can put the rationals in a sequence cause they're countable but their union isn't the real numbers
2012-04-24T13:40:16  <mcstar> no, but the sequence of such sets will approach the reals
2012-04-24T13:40:16  <antimatroid> and there's a countable numbers of rationals between any two rationals
2012-04-24T13:40:27  <antimatroid> sure, but i need the union to be the reals
2012-04-24T13:40:33  <antimatroid> not the limit points
2012-04-24T13:40:37  <mcstar> i get it
2012-04-24T13:40:50  <mcstar> still, the it will hold
2012-04-24T13:40:53  <mcstar> -the
2012-04-24T13:41:26  <mcstar> union of a set and its subset will be the same set
2012-04-24T13:41:27  <antimatroid> i might just ask my friend tomorrow how he did it
2012-04-24T13:41:35  <antimatroid> what?
2012-04-24T13:41:57  <mcstar> B \subset A, then A U B = A
2012-04-24T13:42:16  <antimatroid> yes, but that's not what i have
2012-04-24T13:43:36  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you have a printed version?
2012-04-24T13:43:47  <mcstar> of the problem, in electronic format
2012-04-24T13:44:24  <antimatroid> Defne u on (IR; B(IR)) by letting u(A) be the number of rational numbers in A (of course
2012-04-24T13:44:24  <antimatroid> u(A) = +∞ if there are infinitely many rational numbers in A:) Show that u is a sigma-finite
2012-04-24T13:44:24  <antimatroid> measure under which each open interval of IR has infinite measure.
2012-04-24T13:44:59  <antimatroid> in A).*
2012-04-24T13:45:19  <antimatroid> IR = set of real numbers

2012-04-24T14:57:14  <mcstar> k
2012-04-24T14:57:26  <mcstar> i parsed it as 'assignment bar'
2012-04-24T14:57:37  <mcstar> thought to myself, 'set of assignment or something'
2012-04-24T14:57:43  <mcstar> good nite
2012-04-24T15:01:46  <mcstar> amstan: are you using qgraphicsview/scene?
2012-04-24T15:02:03  <mcstar> i tried that at the beginning

2012-04-24T15:25:13  <amstan> mcstar: no
2012-04-24T15:25:28  <amstan> mcstar: just a widget where i paint stuff myself
2012-04-24T15:25:56  <mcstar> amstan: then i dont get the scrollbar stuff
2012-04-24T15:26:33  <amstan> mcstar: https://gist.github.com/2482916
2012-04-24T15:26:35  <mcstar> i had a scrollbar problem with qgraphicsscene, since it contained items that werent necessarily visible
2012-04-24T15:26:36  <amstan> i finished it
2012-04-24T15:26:56  <amstan> i didn't want to use an automated scrollbar because some stuff has to stay put for my graph
2012-04-24T15:29:19  <mcstar> amstan: so you handle the scrolling yourself
2012-04-24T15:29:23  <amstan> yes
2012-04-24T15:29:42  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2012-04-24T15:29:48  <mcstar> i do it with holding the right mouse button down, and drag the area
2012-04-24T15:29:55  <mcstar> no
2012-04-24T15:29:58  <mcstar> left button
2012-04-24T15:30:02  <mcstar> right is for zooming
2012-04-24T15:30:28  <mcstar> i believe it is more natural than a scrollbar, that was my reasoning
2012-04-24T15:30:57  <mcstar> btw, a qgraphicsscene would do this automatically
2012-04-24T15:31:09  <mcstar> (i was a bit too quick to drop it)
2012-04-24T15:31:12  <amstan> yes, but it'll also move my axis
2012-04-24T15:32:06  <mcstar> i basically have a central widget, for the plot, and 2 for the axes ticks and 2 for the axis labels
2012-04-24T15:32:14  <mcstar> and put these 5 into 1 widget
2012-04-24T15:32:21  <mcstar> axes*
2012-04-24T15:32:27  <amstan> what happens when one of your axis rescales?
2012-04-24T15:32:52  <mcstar> the ticks get recalculated
2012-04-24T15:33:06  <mcstar> and i have a grid too
2012-04-24T15:33:15  <mcstar> made from dashed lines
2012-04-24T15:33:25  <amstan> i'm having performance problems
2012-04-24T15:33:33  <mcstar> this is quite fast
2012-04-24T15:33:35  <amstan> because i'm redrawing the whole thing whenever anything changes
2012-04-24T15:33:40  <amstan> but i might do that in the future
2012-04-24T15:33:41  <mcstar> yeah me too
2012-04-24T15:33:56  <mcstar> i didnt say tha i dont redraw everything
2012-04-24T15:34:11  <amstan> with qgraphicsview you should be able to just drag the widget
2012-04-24T15:34:27  <mcstar> yes
2012-04-24T15:34:31  <mcstar> well, items
2012-04-24T15:34:33  <amstan> yes
2012-04-24T15:34:43  <mcstar> but you can drag the area too
2012-04-24T15:34:53  <amstan> another thing i wanted to do with qt
2012-04-24T15:35:04  <amstan> in kde you can get animated/interactive wallpapers
2012-04-24T15:35:09  <amstan> you can put any widget on it
2012-04-24T15:35:22  <mcstar> so you in plasma?
2012-04-24T15:35:22  <amstan> i wanted to get this svg picture and animate it
2012-04-24T15:35:24  <amstan> yeah
2012-04-24T15:35:26  <mcstar> -so you
2012-04-24T15:35:36  <amstan> but qtsvg is slow as hell
2012-04-24T15:35:47  <amstan> it only does the whole thing at like 4 fps
2012-04-24T15:36:00  <mcstar> you wanted to write the plot in svg and display it?
2012-04-24T15:36:08  <amstan> yes
2012-04-24T15:36:21  <mcstar> qt has something called qml i believe
2012-04-24T15:36:36  <mcstar> some descriptive language, maybe it would be easier with that
2012-04-24T15:36:37  <amstan> i don't wanna use that
2012-04-24T15:36:41  <mcstar> ok
2012-04-24T15:36:44  <amstan> the problem was the svg rendered
2012-04-24T15:37:32  <mcstar> amstan: did any simple svg perform that bad?
2012-04-24T15:37:36  <amstan> mcstar: ideally the final product would look like this: https://github.com/amstan/windfarms/raw/master/inspiration.jpg
2012-04-24T15:37:57  <amstan> well.. i understand where the problem comes from, it tries to redraw absolutelly everything
2012-04-24T15:38:08  <amstan> and on a 3000x1000 something dual screen setup it takes a while
2012-04-24T15:38:26  <mcstar> amstan: i dont get this windfarm
2012-04-24T15:38:37  <amstan> ?
2012-04-24T15:38:43  <mcstar> the picture
2012-04-24T15:38:48  <mcstar> what does it mean?
2012-04-24T15:39:00  <amstan> that's supposed to be the wallpaper
2012-04-24T15:39:09  <amstan> and the things are supposed to spin
2012-04-24T15:39:16  <amstan> dependent on something, like cpu usage
2012-04-24T15:39:34  <mcstar> ah, so the propellers spin on high load?
2012-04-24T15:39:37  <amstan> yeah
2012-04-24T15:39:40  <mcstar> funny
2012-04-24T15:40:16  <mcstar> amstan: what was the test case svg you used in qt?
2012-04-24T15:40:24  <mcstar> did it take long for simple lines too?
2012-04-24T15:40:41  <amstan> idk, never tried it
2012-04-24T15:40:43  <amstan> https://github.com/amstan/windfarms/blob/master/concept.svg
2012-04-24T15:40:46  <amstan> that's the svg
2012-04-24T15:40:51  <amstan> made in inkscape
2012-04-24T15:41:14  <amstan> it's just a path, a gradient and the small windmill

2012-04-24T20:01:56  <tomb__> so i saw the post on the forum about setting up the non-profit.  i dont have any experience with Canadian law and only a little bit of knowledge about non-profits.
2012-04-24T20:02:41  <tomb__> But I am an attorney in the US.  depending on what you are doing, I may be able to offer some assistance.
2012-04-24T20:02:57  <amstan> tomb__: hmm, that would be interesting
2012-04-24T20:03:06  <amstan> tomb__: we were also thinking about needing a lawyer
2012-04-24T20:03:11  <tomb__> i have only been an attorney for 3 years (i was a software developer before law school)
2012-04-24T20:04:11  <tomb__> the requirements for setting up a non-profit and managing it are going to be both legal and financial/accounting
2012-04-24T20:04:18  <tomb__> an accountant might be able to do it for you
2012-04-24T20:05:47  <tomb__> i can look into Canadian law a little bit, but it is outside of my particular sphere of knowledge.
2012-04-24T20:05:55  <amstan> we have a friendly accounting firm where we'll ask for help
2012-04-24T20:06:02  <tomb__> i really enjoyed the ants challenge and would be happy help
2012-04-24T20:06:21  <amstan> tomb__: i'm sure you could help, you probably have more legal knowlege than me and aarossig
2012-04-24T20:06:30  <tomb__> that is likely
2012-04-24T20:06:34  <tomb__> haha
2012-04-24T20:07:26  <tomb__> i dont usually park myself on irc.  do you do most of your discussions on irc?
2012-04-24T20:07:39  <amstan> we haven't gone to them yet, we're both busy with our jobs, aarossig's working overtime
2012-04-24T20:07:40  <tomb__> i suppose i can do that if that is what is required in order to be useful
2012-04-24T20:07:44  <amstan> we'll be free a little later
2012-04-24T20:07:58  <amstan> tomb__: yeah, irc is quite appropriate
2012-04-24T20:08:10  <amstan> for real time discussions like these
2012-04-24T20:08:22  <amstan> but we could do email/forums too
2012-04-24T20:09:11  <tomb__> alright.  aside from during the competition, i havent used irc in many years.  i will download a client and try to stay abreast of discussions here.
2012-04-24T20:09:45  <amstan> tomb__: i find it quite useful to get programming help
2012-04-24T20:10:08  <amstan> tomb__: we also have channel logs and contestbot can remember messages and tell them to people next time they pop in
2012-04-24T20:10:30  <amstan> well.. channel logs are supposed to work, grr
2012-04-24T20:10:39  <tomb__> right, i have looked at those before
