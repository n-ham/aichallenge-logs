2011-08-19T08:31:01  <mleise> :) this channel has *really* died out
2011-08-19T08:31:32  <rabidus> so you tried to make a conversation out there
2011-08-19T08:31:51  <rabidus> but i think that windows > linux
2011-08-19T08:31:57  <rabidus> and amd > intel
2011-08-19T08:32:23  <mleise> no I just wanted to do some troll business

2011-08-19T08:32:56  <rabidus> :)
2011-08-19T08:44:08  <mleise> rabidus: It looks like Emscripten offers an interesting approach at converting C/C++ code to JavaScript including JavaScript implementations of SDL and other libraries.
2011-08-19T08:44:21  <rabidus> what :o
2011-08-19T08:44:28  <mleise> As a proof of concept Python, Doom and other C code have been showcased
2011-08-19T08:45:17  <mleise> That's just wow. I mean the complete Python interpreter in client side JavaScript is somewhat rediculous, but it works.
2011-08-19T08:45:53  <mleise> There is also a ray tracer, an animated 3D example and a text-2-speech synthesizer

2011-08-19T08:46:58  <mleise> I'm just wondering if I could have written the visualizer in C++ using SDL to be really fast and then export that to JavaScript instead of what I have now: running JavaScript in a Java VM.
2011-08-19T08:47:16  <rabidus> yeah, i was thinking that too in this case
2011-08-19T08:47:34  <jbroman> I would suspect that the hand-written JS is still faster than what Emscripten prouces.
2011-08-19T08:48:00  <jbroman> And if the visualizer is used more often from the web, it's the JS version's performance that's more critical. But I haven't tested this.
2011-08-19T08:48:25  <mleise> Yes that and I don't know where the API has its limitations. It could be a major pita if for example I could not render to offscreen pixmaps
2011-08-19T08:49:15  <mleise> jbroman: I am yet to finish the latest iteration that scales better with large ant counts

It may pick up, but I don't think there's a current date set, and any estimate I would give you could be way off (it was at one point intended to start about six months ago).

2011-08-19T14:07:40  <andromeda> is there any issue with uploading atm? getting errors that no MyBot.* file is found when one is actually included
2011-08-19T14:09:40  <mcstar> you shouldnt use *
2011-08-19T14:09:53  <mcstar> use a common extension for your language of choice
2011-08-19T14:10:50  <andromeda> didn't mean to be ambiguous, just trying to generalize. Personally I am referencing a MyBot.lisp file which is included
2011-08-19T14:11:18  <mcstar> im only trying to amuse the listeners of the channel
2011-08-19T14:11:50  <mcstar> .lisp worked for me in the past, havent uploaded anything in more than a month
2011-08-19T14:12:29  <andromeda> it was working well for me also until today. then again, I'm new to lisp and this server, so i could easily have just mucked itup somehow
2011-08-19T14:13:21  <mcstar> can you give me the page with the error?
2011-08-19T14:14:03  <mcstar> (only the link to it..)
2011-08-19T14:14:22  <andromeda> afraid its not too much more descriptive than me:

2011-08-19T14:16:27  <andromeda> ugh, well basically:
2011-08-19T14:16:30  <andromeda> Did not find a recognized MyBot.* file. Please add one of the following filenames to your zip file:
2011-08-19T14:16:34  <andromeda> ...examples...
2011-08-19T14:16:43  <andromeda> no codes, etc
2011-08-19T14:17:24  <mcstar> you sure the filename encoding is ok?
2011-08-19T14:17:37  <mcstar> no unrecognized double byte characters or wth
2011-08-19T14:18:01  <mcstar> obviously no
2011-08-19T14:18:02  <berak> andromeda: maybe there was some other file, that started with MyBo in the zip you uploadedt ? like an obj file, some temp thing, that should not go there ?
2011-08-19T14:18:13  <mcstar> yeah
2011-08-19T14:18:15  <mcstar> but not .o
2011-08-19T14:18:20  <mcstar> lisp has no .o
2011-08-19T14:18:43  <andromeda> the only thing in the folder besides the *.lisp files is the Makefil
2011-08-19T14:19:18  <mcstar> do an ls -a MyBot*
2011-08-19T14:19:41  <mcstar> maybe theres a swap file there i dont know
2011-08-19T14:19:53  <mcstar> alternatively you can look at the compiler script
2011-08-19T14:20:08  <mcstar> to see in what order it does the search and etc.
2011-08-19T14:21:33  <mcstar> its possible that more than 1 kind of error is linked with the same error message

2011-08-19T14:40:39  <andromeda> alright, so the MyBot.* error was a user error, not sure whether I should have known this or not, but for anyone who might run into it again
2011-08-19T14:41:01  <andromeda> in mac, if you compress a folder, it decompresses back into a typical folder, that I knew
2011-08-19T14:41:19  <andromeda> the server does not want to unzip to a folder, the server wants your .zip to unzip straight into your files
2011-08-19T14:41:24  <andromeda> thus, not being able to find it

2011-08-19T14:43:06  <mcstar> how did you compress your files?
2011-08-19T14:43:21  <mcstar> zip sub.zip *
2011-08-19T14:43:27  <mcstar> thats how i usually do it
2011-08-19T14:43:48  <mcstar> there got to be a zip command under osx
2011-08-19T14:43:54  <andromeda> i wasn't using the terminal to zip. I was using mac's built-in compress folder, but remembered that having issues next year
2011-08-19T14:44:04  <andromeda> so i used WinZip for mac, but there was still an issue
2011-08-19T14:44:10  <andromeda> so i dragged only the files and viola
2011-08-19T14:44:20  <mcstar> :S
2011-08-19T14:44:27  <mcstar> well, if it works for you..
2011-08-19T14:44:57  <andromeda> no no, cleary my troubles indicate that would be a stupid way to do it
2011-08-19T14:45:00  <andromeda> i shall heed your advice

2011-08-19T14:45:20  <mcstar> you do use the terminal dont you?
2011-08-19T14:45:31  <mcstar> for running the playgame scripts and such

2011-08-19T14:45:42  <andromeda> for most things yes
2011-08-19T14:46:02  <mcstar> ok, so its not far from you to use it to zip then

2011-08-19T14:46:30  <andromeda> but i am a sucker for some pretty windows
2011-08-19T14:47:45  <mcstar> btw you dont have to use zip, gzip is also available
2011-08-19T14:47:54  <mcstar> or bz2 maybe too
2011-08-19T14:47:58  <mcstar> im not really sure
2011-08-19T14:48:26  <mcstar> i think its on the wiki somewhere
2011-08-19T14:48:39  <andromeda> noted, ill just do that in the future, WinZip is cumbersome
2011-08-19T14:48:54  <mcstar> add it to youre makefile
2011-08-19T14:48:56  <andromeda> well i just wanted to relay the solution to a problem, im off
