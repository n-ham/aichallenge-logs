2011-02-04T09:54:33  <Frontier> antimatroid: It depends on how small the squares would be. There is no point in animating the ants when they are on 3x3 px squares.
2011-02-04T09:56:13  <Frontier> The same goes for the background graphics. They would be too distracting I think.

2011-02-04T10:02:27  <antimatroid> i'm waiting to talk to McLeopold about io and maps to do a map generator
2011-02-04T10:04:00  <antimatroid> it would be fairly easy to make a symmetric torus map for general n player games if each player got a ring section of the torus, or if 2|n, then give each player half a ring section, but the symmetry for that is a bit more iffy i think
2011-02-04T10:14:43  <Meatkat> Wow, lots of action on the forum recently.
2011-02-04T10:15:55  <Meatkat> I'd say that would mean that the next competition will be announced soon, but I think it means people *want* the next competition to be announced soon.
2011-02-04T10:17:29  <Meatkat> How do you propose to make a visualizer for a torus shaped map?
2011-02-04T10:18:10  <Frontier> It's nothing different. It only means that the units can move out on one side and come back in on the other
2011-02-04T10:18:37  <Meatkat> Oh, right
2011-02-04T10:19:52  <aerique> Ants ought to be on a Moebius strip.
2011-02-04T10:21:33  <Frontier> Then just wall off the left and the right side :)

2011-02-04T10:25:38  <antimatroid> Frontier: not quite :P
2011-02-04T10:25:47  <antimatroid> you wrap the left bottom to right top
2011-02-04T10:26:22  <antimatroid> otherwise you just get a cylinder
2011-02-04T10:29:07  <Meatkat> I don't know if I like the idea of wrapping the map. I think it adds too many negative affects in the form of a barriers for noobies understanding the game (and feeling confident enough to make a player) than it adds in gameplay enhancement.
2011-02-04T10:31:08  <antimatroid> it's not that complicated
2011-02-04T10:31:22  <antimatroid> and makes it easier to do symmetry for n>4 players
2011-02-04T10:31:27  <Meatkat> says the Masters student? or PhD student?
2011-02-04T10:31:38  <antimatroid> just finished undergrad
2011-02-04T10:33:21  <Meatkat> It does make symmetry easier for large number of players. But like I said, I think it throws up an unnecessary barrier to people just starting out.
2011-02-04T10:34:29  <Meatkat> But if it were specified that there would be a large number of players per map it would probably be necessary.
2011-02-04T10:35:15  <antimatroid> it's fairly easy to write a "get direction" function using an array of directions
2011-02-04T10:35:36  <antimatroid> you just translate and modulo
2011-02-04T10:35:53  <antimatroid> it could even be included in the starter bots
2011-02-04T10:36:32  <Meatkat> If it's abstracted out in the started bots that'd be okay.
2011-02-04T10:36:59  <Meatkat> But that just adds more work to the people making the starter bots.
2011-02-04T10:37:20  <antimatroid> Frontier: i still much prefer to ants game we had going :( that would would with more players on a torus too
2011-02-04T10:37:41  <antimatroid> Meatkat: that shouldn't be an issue
2011-02-04T10:37:50  <antimatroid> hell i'll write the c++ one
2011-02-04T10:39:10  <Meatkat> Okay... and the other 10?
2011-02-04T10:39:35  <antimatroid> it usually starts with 4-5, then competitors write the rest
2011-02-04T10:39:47  <antimatroid> it really is like a <10 line function
2011-02-04T10:40:12  <Meatkat> I just don't find it logical to say that man-hour concerns aren't an issue...
2011-02-04T10:40:47  <antimatroid> it's not expensive relative to a lot of other things
2011-02-04T10:40:52  <antimatroid> making it fairly insignificant
2011-02-04T10:41:35  <Meatkat> You sound like a congressmen... lol
2011-02-04T10:41:50  <antimatroid> i did do an economics degree :P
2011-02-04T10:42:08  <Meatkat> $1 million there $1 million there, it's fairly insignificant in the grand scheme of things
2011-02-04T10:45:46  <Frontier> Have we settled with moving pixels that have an influence on every square around them already?
2011-02-04T10:46:05  <antimatroid> Frontier: ??
2011-02-04T10:46:26  <Frontier> Or is there still a chance the ants have a 'direction' they look?
2011-02-04T10:46:35  <antimatroid> i don't like their current visualiser

2011-02-04T10:52:12  <Frontier> :-( we'll have to live with that then. My visualizer just looks like that because we worked closely together when designing the game engine and visualizer
2011-02-04T10:52:35  <antimatroid> i still prefer that game
2011-02-04T10:52:40  <antimatroid> it had a lot to it
2011-02-04T10:53:42  <antimatroid> harvest could even go straight to the bases and there could be more players, each player gets a point for every hp they remove of another player, stepping on an enemy base kills every one of their ants and you get all the hp from their remaining ants
2011-02-04T10:53:42  <Frontier> Yeah, it gave the ants some life and decisions to make.
2011-02-04T10:53:45  <antimatroid> player with the most points wins
2011-02-04T10:54:07  <Meatkat> Well you could always write a starter bot and get someone to throw up a TCP server. If it took off the admins would take notice
2011-02-04T10:54:29  <antimatroid> Meatkat: there was a working engine, visualiser and bot, people didn't seem that keen :\
2011-02-04T10:55:12  <antimatroid> *working* engine, it was fairly inefficient
2011-02-04T10:56:29  <Meatkat> Well you could always write a starter bot and get someone to throw up a TCP server. If it took off the admins would take notice.
2011-02-04T10:56:39  <antimatroid> basically, your ants spawned on your home base, you had to go out and harvest grains to spawn new ants (depositing it back home, but that was optinal), each ant started with 5 hp, you could attack adjacent ants and ants landing on the same square were fused/fought
2011-02-04T10:56:58  <Frontier> remember how the ants used to dance in circles *sigh* the good old times
2011-02-04T10:57:17  <antimatroid> Frontier: how hard would it be for you to run the old games on that page again?

2011-02-04T11:10:00  <antimatroid> Frontier made it look nice
2011-02-04T11:10:36  <Meatkat> Indeed he did
2011-02-04T11:12:25  <Meatkat> I think that deserves a new thread on the forums. If you had the motivation I'd say you should write a starter bot (or just modify the current to be more readable) and post that along with it
2011-02-04T11:12:41  <Meatkat> And if you're REALLY motivated, get a TCP server running
2011-02-04T11:12:52  <Meatkat> I check the forums often and never saw that, did you post the link?
2011-02-04T11:12:55  <antimatroid> it's already been posted in the old ants thread
2011-02-04T11:13:04  <antimatroid> i'll wait to see what jeff thinks when he does actually see it
2011-02-04T11:13:34  <antimatroid> i think they want 4 player, which could  be done, but i'd rather not bother unless it was a viable option
2011-02-04T11:14:07  <antimatroid> there's also too many ants being spawned
2011-02-04T11:14:15  <antimatroid> but that's easyish to fix
2011-02-04T11:17:06  <antimatroid> combat is far less trivial than with simplified ants
2011-02-04T11:17:20  <amstan> antimatroid: which one?
2011-02-04T11:17:34  <Meatkat> http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v3/
2011-02-04T11:17:54  <amstan> way too slow and too many things on screen
2011-02-04T11:19:42  <antimatroid> amstan: slowness can be fixed by changing game parameters/rules
2011-02-04T11:19:54  <amstan> what parameters?
2011-02-04T11:20:04  <antimatroid> ie. harvest goes straight to base without being "returned" and not as many resources so not a ridiculous number of ants
2011-02-04T11:20:50  <antimatroid> that also removes "harvest carrying" for each ant
2011-02-04T11:21:08  <antimatroid> then you're left with ant hp, which could also be removed, just have an attack kill the attacked ant
2011-02-04T11:21:26  <amstan> that's pretty much simplified ants then
2011-02-04T11:21:35  <amstan> except new ants come from the base
2011-02-04T11:21:43  <amstan> and battles are solved by who attacks first
2011-02-04T11:21:54  <antimatroid> yeah, and you still have "invade the base" objective
2011-02-04T11:22:07  <antimatroid> i prefer having hp because then attacks are more complicated
2011-02-04T11:22:16  <antimatroid> as you want to attack them from more directions at once
2011-02-04T11:23:13  <antimatroid> you could also score games by how many hp of enemies they take from attacks, if you land on their base, you get the hp from all their live ants and that player is wiped from the game
2011-02-04T11:23:21  <antimatroid> there are many variations
2011-02-04T11:24:15  <antimatroid> it's fairly easy to write a semi intelligible stupid starter bot that people can make a few simple improvements too and see a decent improvement in their botst
2011-02-04T11:24:37  <antimatroid> yet allows plenty of room for strategy variation near the top etc., I think it's a fairly ideal game, but i have always been biased on that
2011-02-04T11:25:31  <antimatroid> the time is pi

2011-02-04T12:43:49  <antimatroid> i'm not really comfortable with players > 4 playing on a map that doesn't have wrapped edges
2011-02-04T12:44:14  <antimatroid> if each player gets a single ring on a torus, then maps can be generated for any n
2011-02-04T12:44:42  <antimatroid> an alternative is to split each ring up into x sections for x*d players
2011-02-04T12:45:25  <antimatroid> then i'm also not really sure of how symmetry to make everything, one option is to fill in 4 squares for every players starting region
2011-02-04T12:45:51  <antimatroid> symmetric**
2011-02-04T12:47:14  <McLeopold> sry, catching up on last night
2011-02-04T12:47:22  <antimatroid> all good
2011-02-04T12:47:32  <antimatroid> i'm going to go to bed in a bit, will be up again later
2011-02-04T12:47:59  <McLeopold> okay, I thought about io last night while trying to sleep
2011-02-04T12:48:10  <McLeopold> I think I want to etherpad this
2011-02-04T12:48:42  <McLeopold> http://ietherpad.com/TR0zbEqvx1
2011-02-04T12:49:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: ^^
2011-02-04T12:50:08  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm watching
2011-02-04T12:50:15  <McLeopold> oh, typein your name
2011-02-04T12:52:47  <antimatroid> what's the deal with .png maps?

2011-02-04T16:22:34  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I'm thinking about move resolution
2011-02-04T16:22:44  <McLeopold> I'd like your perspective
2011-02-04T16:23:18  <McLeopold> or antimatroid
2011-02-04T16:23:26  <McLeopold> heck, even mega1
2011-02-04T16:23:32  <jmcarthur> like you have an idea or you want suggestions?
2011-02-04T16:23:39  <McLeopold> both
2011-02-04T16:23:54  <jmcarthur> let's hear yours. i need to get my mind warmed up before i can contribute anything
2011-02-04T16:23:56  <McLeopold> so, to resolve all moves, i'm going to make a copy of the current map without any ants
2011-02-04T16:24:06  <McLeopold> then all moves create ants on the new map
2011-02-04T16:24:21  <McLeopold> this will allow you to bump your own forces
2011-02-04T16:24:29  <McLeopold> the bot still controls the order of the moves
2011-02-04T16:25:12  <McLeopold> wait, no
2011-02-04T16:25:13  <McLeopold> arg
2011-02-04T16:25:22  <jmcarthur> okay, so you mean it's order dependent?
2011-02-04T16:25:29  <McLeopold> so, if 2 colors go for the same spot, they kill each other
2011-02-04T16:25:31  <jmcarthur> which isn't necessarily a bad thing
2011-02-04T16:25:38  <jmcarthur> mkay
2011-02-04T16:25:49  <McLeopold> if 2 red and 1 yellow go for the same spot, what happens?
2011-02-04T16:25:52  <McLeopold> 1 red?
2011-02-04T16:26:11  <McLeopold> if I resolve red first, one red bumps, then the other gets killed by yellow
2011-02-04T16:26:26  <jmcarthur> we could really throw things off by making the resolution random :P
2011-02-04T16:26:29  <McLeopold> reversed, the first red kills yellow, then the second one succeeds?
2011-02-04T16:26:53  <McLeopold> or, I could mark the spot as having dead ants, then bump the second red.
2011-02-04T16:27:00  <McLeopold> then it is always deterministic
2011-02-04T16:27:20  <jmcarthur> modulo ordering of commands
2011-02-04T16:27:43  <McLeopold> a single colors ordering matter for it
2011-02-04T16:28:00  <McLeopold> but I want to make sure the engines ordering of players doesn't matter
2011-02-04T16:28:18  <jmcarthur> (why is "modulo" even appropriate for things like that? i never understood its colloquial usage)
2011-02-04T16:28:20  <McLeopold> I think blocking on attacked spaces will work
2011-02-04T16:28:25  <jmcarthur> i think so too
2011-02-04T16:28:30  <McLeopold> okay
2011-02-04T16:28:31  <jmcarthur> and makes sense
2011-02-04T16:28:33  *** amstan <amstan!~alex@142.222.20.24> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-04T16:28:33  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o amstan
2011-02-04T16:28:42  <McLeopold> this also allows ants to swap places
2011-02-04T16:28:43  <jmcarthur> however...
2011-02-04T16:29:01  <McLeopold> ...
2011-02-04T16:29:49  <McLeopold> I hope I'm waiting for a really good thought...
2011-02-04T16:30:25  <jmcarthur> what about recursive situations? like one of the red ants is actually trying to move somewhere but gets blocked, then is killed by an incoming yellow, making a body, then that blocks another red? but what if the thing blocking the original red is only due to yet another move? i think this could cause cycles, is my point
2011-02-04T16:30:43  <jmcarthur> which makes it complicated to implement
2011-02-04T16:31:33  <jmcarthur> might be nicer to just kill all ants that try to move to the same spot, regardless of number or color, and they just create a single body
2011-02-04T16:31:36  <McLeopold> each bot would have their ant moves done separatly
2011-02-04T16:32:02  <McLeopold> so, resolve all red moves
2011-02-04T16:32:07  <McLeopold> then resolve all yellow moves
2011-02-04T16:32:34  <McLeopold> hmm... with 3 players, that does get messy
2011-02-04T16:32:43  <jmcarthur> resolve all red moves, resolve all yellow moves (creates some bodies!), resolve all blue moves (wtf!)
2011-02-04T16:32:47  <McLeopold> player 1 and 2 go for the spot, die, then player 3 might block
2011-02-04T16:32:51  <jmcarthur> blue gets screwed then
2011-02-04T16:33:02  <jmcarthur> or maybe red and yellow do
2011-02-04T16:33:04  <jmcarthur> either way, unfair
2011-02-04T16:33:10  <McLeopold> yeah, okay, all ants die
2011-02-04T16:33:26  <McLeopold> only fair way that doesn't involve too much code
2011-02-04T16:33:53  <jmcarthur> the way i would do it is:  for each square, gather all incoming ants. if it's just one ant, that's the new occupant of the square. if it's more than one, the new occupant is a body.
2011-02-04T16:33:57  <McLeopold> well, I could have a separate map for each color, and include the blocking, then overlay them all
2011-02-04T16:34:49  <McLeopold> I'd like to try and get a single color to block itself, just to make it easier for the programmers not to accidentally lose ants
2011-02-04T16:35:50  <jmcarthur> two points about that: 1) yes, it's perhaps a bit nicer behavior for when you make an AI mistake, but 2) it's very tough to code
2011-02-04T16:35:50  <McLeopold> so, if I mark a spot as a conflict, only 1 ant of each color can die
2011-02-04T16:36:32  <McLeopold> either way, I need to mark spots as having conflicts
2011-02-04T16:36:51  <McLeopold> the blocking way, I also  need to mark which colors have attempted to enter the spot, not too much more
2011-02-04T16:36:57  <jmcarthur> actually, i was thinking that if you had blocking for same-colored ants then *both* of them should be blocked
2011-02-04T16:37:06  <jmcarthur> that would make resolution easy again
2011-02-04T16:37:22  <jmcarthur> well
2011-02-04T16:37:25  <McLeopold> this is turning into diplomacy
2011-02-04T16:37:31  <jmcarthur> forget i said that :)
2011-02-04T16:37:34  <jmcarthur> it's not actually that easy
2011-02-04T16:37:42  <jmcarthur> i'm just not so sure about blocking in the first place
2011-02-04T16:37:52  <McLeopold> only own color
2011-02-04T16:38:08  <jmcarthur> i personally think it makes sense that if you make a dire error then suffering a penalty for it is fine
2011-02-04T16:38:10  <McLeopold> and it is deterministic based on the bot's own move ordering
2011-02-04T16:39:13  <McLeopold> Okay, but think about a bot where each ant is using it's own neural network.  It's simpler for the coder if you don't have to worry about killing your own ants.
2011-02-04T16:39:27  <jmcarthur> the coder could just stick in a failsafe
2011-02-04T16:40:08  <McLeopold> plus, I'm devising a scoring method where you get a point for each ant of yours that dies, so I don't want you to be able to kill your own ants without a fight with an opponent
2011-02-04T16:40:34  <jmcarthur> that seems to be a counterintuitive scoring method... ^_^
2011-02-04T16:40:53  <McLeopold> it rewards aggresiveness, but not greed
2011-02-04T16:41:19  <McLeopold> to prevent cherry pickers from getting a good score
2011-02-04T16:41:25  <jmcarthur> so you just want your opponent to kill as many of your ants as possible?
2011-02-04T16:41:38  <jmcarthur> without killing theirs?
2011-02-04T16:41:40  <McLeopold> yes, but you also have to harvest them
2011-02-04T16:41:57  <McLeopold> and if you are wiped out, you loose the chance for more score
2011-02-04T16:42:28  <McLeopold> maybe it should just be kills, but then that gets tricky to assign to players
2011-02-04T16:42:35  <jmcarthur> well, sounds tough, but i don't know whether i like the implication it has one the game... that the only way you should be able to lose ants is in combat
2011-02-04T16:42:41  <jmcarthur> *on the game

2011-02-04T16:44:02  <McLeopold> yeah

2011-02-04T18:48:22  <McLeopold> antimatroid
2011-02-04T18:48:27  <antimatroid> i'm here
2011-02-04T18:48:34  <McLeopold> what's up
2011-02-04T18:48:39  <antimatroid> i added a tiny bit to your mapline info sent to the bot
2011-02-04T18:48:57  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-04T18:49:15  <antimatroid> with your resolving ants moving into the same square, could you not have an array numbering the number of kids going in for each player then argmax that? taking no argmax if it's a tie?
2011-02-04T18:49:51  <McLeopold> so, the most win?
2011-02-04T18:50:20  <antimatroid> yes
2011-02-04T18:50:44  <antimatroid> the idea being that one ant from each time participates in each round of fighting
2011-02-04T18:50:53  <antimatroid> leaving the player with the most ants with any left
2011-02-04T18:51:01  <antimatroid> and all friend ants left after fighting fuse into 1 ant
2011-02-04T18:51:47  <McLeopold> sure, I can make that an option
2011-02-04T18:51:56  <antimatroid> i have an idea for maps to run past you...
2011-02-04T18:52:00  <McLeopold> jmcarthur and I were thinking the all die
2011-02-04T18:52:10  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-04T18:53:51  <McLeopold> so, what's the idea for the maps?
2011-02-04T18:54:17  <antimatroid> each player (say n players) needs a region in a rectangular grid with edges wrapped, so if I take the largest factor f of n > 1 and preferably < n but not strictly, then that gives the number of rings on the torus, then n/f players partition each ring?
2011-02-04T18:54:54  <McLeopold> what if n is prime?
2011-02-04T18:55:03  <antimatroid> each player gets a single ring on the torus
2011-02-04T18:55:16  <antimatroid> hence the but not strictly
2011-02-04T18:55:24  <McLeopold> technically, a ring and a slice are the same thing on a torus
2011-02-04T18:55:26  <antimatroid> in that case f is n
2011-02-04T18:55:41  <antimatroid> yeah, i think you know what I mean though yeah?
2011-02-04T18:55:52  <antimatroid> that way a map can be generated for anything up to 26 players
2011-02-04T18:56:04  <McLeopold> if you go back to the rectangle, assuming edges wrap, each player gets its own rectangle of the same size, arranged in any grid fasion
2011-02-04T18:56:19  <antimatroid> also, is the engine currently passing information to players and having all their turns run at once? I think it's important that becomes sequential, particularly with >2 players
2011-02-04T18:56:35  <McLeopold> so 24 players can be 1x24 or 2x12 or 3x8 or 4x6
2011-02-04T18:57:08  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-04T18:57:16  <McLeopold> yes, everything is simultaneous
2011-02-04T18:57:55  <antimatroid> i think players should make their moves with computation sequentially (but all passed information from the same state) then process all moves simultaneously
2011-02-04T18:58:31  <antimatroid> we also need to force the other processes to not get cpu time during other players turns
2011-02-04T18:59:26  <antimatroid> a better option is to time bots on cpu time, but it's seemed rather hard to coordinate with all the different languages
2011-02-04T18:59:52  <McLeopold> I don't understand the computation sequentially comment
2011-02-04T19:00:17  <McLeopold> And, I'm not planning to implement any bot timing or anything.  That's up to Zannick to do.
2011-02-04T19:00:37  <antimatroid> instead of : pass players the information and give them all 1 second to return their moves
2011-02-04T19:00:38  <antimatroid> pass player 1 information, get their moves, pass player 2 information, get their moves, ..., process player 1,... , n's moves
2011-02-04T19:00:54  <McLeopold> oh, ok
2011-02-04T19:01:04  <McLeopold> that's for zannick to fix as well
2011-02-04T19:01:12  <antimatroid> otherwise atm each player gets at worst 1/n seconds per move
2011-02-04T19:01:21  <antimatroid> - overhead
2011-02-04T19:01:26  <McLeopold> He'll probably agree with you.
2011-02-04T19:01:35  <Zannick> that could double game time, but it sounds fairly reasonable besides
2011-02-04T19:01:43  <McLeopold> We could probably even lessen it to 0.5 seconds if we did that.
2011-02-04T19:01:54  <antimatroid> it may more than double the game time, but i think it's necessary :)
2011-02-04T19:02:03  <Zannick> if we go multiplayer, even more
2011-02-04T19:02:12  <McLeopold> Right now, ants will probably have longer run times than planet wars.
2011-02-04T19:02:19  <Zannick> but it'd be bad to run them all at the same time anyway
2011-02-04T19:02:24  <antimatroid> exactly, i'd rather get half the time under that condition rather than the actual time be fairly dynamic
2011-02-04T19:02:43  <antimatroid> smaller maps will make for faster games
2011-02-04T19:02:54  <antimatroid> i was thinking each players starting region might be static?
2011-02-04T19:03:05  <antimatroid> like 15x15 or something?
2011-02-04T19:03:06  <McLeopold> yeah, but I don't want to limit what we see at first like we did with planetwars
2011-02-04T19:03:32  <McLeopold> I want all the crazy maps ideas to come out first, then the community can choose what is working best.
2011-02-04T19:03:44  <McLeopold> Then we avoid the map issue from last time, somewhat.
2011-02-04T19:03:58  <antimatroid> what if i take all non-paired unique factors of n then pick randomly from that to make up the ring density and no. rings on the torus?
2011-02-04T19:04:21  <antimatroid> McLeopold: that's why you haven't already got a map generator from me, I'm trying to think it through first
2011-02-04T19:04:34  <antimatroid> this method works for n in [2, 26]
2011-02-04T19:04:39  <McLeopold> this is like when you where doing polar coordinates and I was doing cartesian for planetwars :)
2011-02-04T19:04:44  <antimatroid> so players in a game could also be dynamic
2011-02-04T19:05:33  <antimatroid> i sat down and worked the problem out in polar, it was just easier for me to program it like that :P
2011-02-04T19:06:29  <McLeopold> what's a non-paired unique factor?
2011-02-04T19:06:42  <antimatroid> say you have 6, then 1, 2 and 3
2011-02-04T19:06:50  <antimatroid> wait, 1 and 2
2011-02-04T19:06:59  <McLeopold> okay, I know what factors are
2011-02-04T19:07:01  <antimatroid> 6 is paired with 1 and 3 paired with 2
2011-02-04T19:07:16  <antimatroid> there is probably a better name, but i don't know it off the top of my head :)
2011-02-04T19:07:19  <McLeopold> because their product is n?
2011-02-04T19:07:26  <antimatroid> yep
2011-02-04T19:07:37  <antimatroid> and i can get it from 6/first factor
2011-02-04T19:08:02  <antimatroid> so i take the set 1,2 and pick one of those, then the regions are set up like first factor x second factor
2011-02-04T19:08:19  <antimatroid> then with edges wrapped, i can make it symmetric except for relative positions to other players
2011-02-04T19:08:28  <McLeopold> so, with an area of a (or n players) how many unique rectangles can you make?
2011-02-04T19:08:45  <antimatroid> area of a?
2011-02-04T19:08:49  <McLeopold> 6
2011-02-04T19:08:59  <antimatroid> unique rectangles?
2011-02-04T19:09:10  <McLeopold> 1x6 and 2x3
2011-02-04T19:09:28  <antimatroid> is 2x3 each players starting region?
2011-02-04T19:09:33  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-04T19:09:38  <McLeopold> oh no
2011-02-04T19:09:45  <McLeopold> 2x3 grid of starting regions
2011-02-04T19:10:17  <antimatroid> say you split the map for 6 players up into regions of 2x3
2011-02-04T19:10:32  <McLeopold> I think we are saying the same thing.
2011-02-04T19:10:36  <antimatroid> each region might be say 15x15, so you have a final grid of 30x45
2011-02-04T19:10:43  <McLeopold> I was just pointing out our different ways of thinking
2011-02-04T19:10:49  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-04T19:11:04  <antimatroid> then i pick a starting location for the first region, and place that symmetrically in each other region for other players starting region
2011-02-04T19:11:18  <McLeopold> and, favor the width being longer, since monitors are usually longer width
2011-02-04T19:11:49  <antimatroid> i had an idea, you could have "ant hill creation" which occurs if a single player has 8 ants surrounding a square?
2011-02-04T19:12:14  <antimatroid> but may complicate things too much

2011-02-04T19:12:36  <antimatroid> favouring it being longer just has regions split by nx1

2011-02-04T19:13:09  <McLeopold> n x m where n <= m
2011-02-04T19:13:19  <antimatroid> okay sure
2011-02-04T19:13:31  <McLeopold> but that's easy, just start at 1 and calc the factors
2011-02-04T19:13:34  <antimatroid> i'll just take the set of smaller factors and pick n from that

2011-02-04T19:14:16  <McLeopold> I've got an idea for a map generator.  Let me look for the link...
2011-02-04T19:14:16  <antimatroid> for the love of god, nobody should write any code indexing stuff [x][y] rather than [row][col]
2011-02-04T19:14:23  <antimatroid> it's aweful, and not just because it's what i'm used to
2011-02-04T19:14:34  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-04T19:14:40  <antimatroid> eg. map files in .txt form
2011-02-04T19:14:40  <McLeopold> maybe in the next version...
2011-02-04T19:14:51  <antimatroid> indexed by [x][y] you need to rotate it to print
2011-02-04T19:15:48  <antimatroid> the next issue is how symmetric to make each region?
2011-02-04T19:16:10  <McLeopold> http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/12/maze-generation-recursive-division-algorithm
2011-02-04T19:16:12  <antimatroid> should each player have squares placed symmetrically for accessing adjacent regions?
2011-02-04T19:16:30  <McLeopold> let's not limit ourselves at first
2011-02-04T19:16:46  <McLeopold> Let's try and stretch the limit of maps for the start of the contest.
2011-02-04T19:17:00  <antimatroid> i plan to
2011-02-04T19:17:06  <antimatroid> i have wall placement worked out
2011-02-04T19:17:48  <antimatroid> there will be min/max density perameters to play around with
2011-02-04T19:18:18  <antimatroid> atm i think i need to place 4 squares per region for every wall/resource square picked out
2011-02-04T19:18:39  <antimatroid> it can still be symmetric placing less, but "less symmetric"
2011-02-04T19:19:05  <antimatroid> i'm doing a physics unit this semester entirely devoted to symmetry stuff with lie groups :D
2011-02-04T19:19:22  <antimatroid> it's a post grad unit and i've done no physics, i'm banking on it mostly being maths
2011-02-04T19:20:35  <McLeopold> over my head
2011-02-04T19:21:34  <antimatroid> oh, what are your thoughts on vision radius?
2011-02-04T19:21:49  <antimatroid> my old ants game had that set at 6 and i ensures players home bases were outside others field of vision
2011-02-04T19:22:10  <antimatroid> also, it might be easy to just assume where players start is also an ant hill/ home base?

2011-02-04T19:23:22  <antimatroid> i'm going to leave the feature in there for the moment
2011-02-04T19:23:25  <antimatroid> fog is cooler imo
2011-02-04T19:23:42  <antimatroid> it's fairly easy to paint out which squares each player can see for passing information
2011-02-04T19:23:49  <McLeopold> I think it makes for a game of less skill.
2011-02-04T19:24:03  <antimatroid> hmmm, i'd disagree
2011-02-04T19:24:09  *** iFire <iFire!~kittens@unaffiliated/ifire> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-04T19:24:35  <antimatroid> you both need to scout out the map and maximise your visibility while ensuring you have friends close enough to create good offensive structures when attacking
2011-02-04T19:25:13  <antimatroid> it also means you need to maintain visibility with all paths to your base
2011-02-04T19:25:23  <antimatroid> so you can see incoming intruders and block them before they invade
2011-02-04T19:26:00  <McLeopold> I'm not saying it involves less tactics, just that you have less control over your survival.
2011-02-04T19:26:10  <McLeopold> More randomness
2011-02-04T19:26:26  <antimatroid> you could also potentially not even tell people how many players there were then
2011-02-04T19:27:02  <McLeopold> okay, back to code...
2011-02-04T19:27:23  <antimatroid> i don't think i can hide the opponents home bases very well
2011-02-04T19:27:31  <antimatroid> i think people will have a pretty decent idea of where they all are
2011-02-04T19:27:38  <antimatroid> ant hills*
2011-02-04T19:27:41  <antimatroid> i am trying to convert i swear
2011-02-04T19:28:30  <antimatroid> we need to work out how to pass game strings to the visualiser
2011-02-04T19:28:39  <antimatroid> particularly, for Frontier's visualiser
2011-02-04T20:34:17  <Frontier> oh i'm drunk again. what is it? 24 players in one match? no way
2011-02-04T20:34:36  <Zannick> 24 is pretty excessive
2011-02-04T20:34:49  <antimatroid> i have it picking randomly from 4-16 atm
2011-02-04T20:34:55  <antimatroid> but that can easily be tweaked
2011-02-04T20:35:00  <Frontier> there aren't 24 distinct colors even to visualize them

2011-02-04T20:37:04  <Frontier> don't try to make the game fit the visualizer. the idea must be fun, the graphics come secondary
2011-02-04T20:37:23  <antimatroid> what do you think would be a realistic max dimensions?
2011-02-04T20:37:36  <antimatroid> with smaller ants and no hp/harvest
2011-02-04T20:37:38  <Zannick> i'm worried more about implementation and efficiency
2011-02-04T20:37:53  <antimatroid> atm i think the maps are too large for short games anyway
2011-02-04T20:38:56  <Frontier> maybe 16x16 would be a gfx size that still looks ok. now take your average laptop screen of 1280x800 and cut off some space for the browser
2011-02-04T20:39:35  <antimatroid> 16x16?
2011-02-04T20:39:46  <antimatroid> i was thinking maybe 50xsomething?
2011-02-04T20:39:48  <Frontier> the next step would be just points moving around
2011-02-04T20:40:05  <Frontier> 16x16 pixels per square that is
2011-02-04T20:41:03  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-02-04T20:43:45  <Frontier> amstan is right, the gameplay on the visualizer is slow. i noticed that today.
2011-02-04T20:44:21  <amstan> Frontier: yeah.. like.. i wanna see a game end within one minute
2011-02-04T20:44:52  <Frontier> I *could* of course change the timers -.-
2011-02-04T20:46:17  <antimatroid> there is less to see so i was kind of expecting that to happen :)
2011-02-04T20:46:20  <Frontier> I think two speeds can do the trick. One speed, just to get the idea and have the animation end in a few seconds and another speed to see all the details.
2011-02-04T20:46:51  <antimatroid> Frontier: being able to progress through with arrow keys is sufficient for watching slowly imo, just speed it up :)
2011-02-04T20:47:34  <antimatroid> i don't think this engine has ant ids atm either
2011-02-04T20:48:14  <Frontier> done deal - or whatever you native speakers say ^^
2011-02-04T20:49:43  <antimatroid> :)
2011-02-04T21:02:47  <McLeopold> no, my version doesn't have ant id's
2011-02-04T21:03:25  <McLeopold> and, you would have to infer which ants died unless you went through the resolution yourself from turn to turn
2011-02-04T21:04:02  <antimatroid> i added it to mine just for the visualiser
2011-02-04T21:04:03  <McLeopold> Zannick: I'm working on the efficiency of a 100x100 map.  I think I can get the engine pretty fast.
2011-02-04T21:04:09  <antimatroid> i think it's worth it
2011-02-04T21:04:25  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what are the bottlenecks?
2011-02-04T21:04:49  <antimatroid> possibleNoPlayers = [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16]
2011-02-04T21:04:52  <antimatroid> i'm now using that
2011-02-04T21:04:54  <Zannick> the main bottlenecks are actually the players themselves and the number of players
2011-02-04T21:05:03  <Zannick> i'm not worried about the engine
2011-02-04T21:05:10  <Zannick> but it's good for that to be efficient, too :)
2011-02-04T21:05:27  <antimatroid> give each player 0.5 seconds to start with i say

2011-02-04T21:16:40  <McLeopold> Zannick: with smaller map sizes, we can probably run more games per minute on the server, but I'd like to keep a large variable of map sizes to start with, and then we can see through trial an error where the sweet spot is.
2011-02-04T21:16:54  <McLeopold> The sweet spot being the most fun.
2011-02-04T21:16:58  <Zannick> sounds good to me
2011-02-04T21:17:23  <McLeopold> After that, then we can tune for games per minute or whatever gives players enough games to do improvements.
2011-02-04T21:17:55  <McLeopold> so, I figure start with map sizes varying from 20x20 to 200x200 to start with
2011-02-04T21:18:18  <McLeopold> and we can slowly narrow the constraints from there
2011-02-04T21:18:31  <McLeopold> actually, 200x200 might be kinda big.
2011-02-04T21:18:58  <McLeopold> if you figure a 1000 turn starting limit, that gets you 5 times around the map max on the longest game
2011-02-04T21:20:09  <McLeopold> antimatroid: the bottleneck is choosing to index the ants by location, and having to loop through the list to find neighbors, or having a matrix and having to scan it to find ants.
2011-02-04T21:20:21  <McLeopold> I'm trying a system that does both right now.
2011-02-04T21:24:03  <antimatroid> 200x200 doesn't work with frontiers visualiser
2011-02-04T21:24:15  <antimatroid> and i think is larger than necessary anyway
2011-02-04T21:24:22  <antimatroid> i'm still playing around with the mapgen stuff atm
2011-02-04T21:24:29  <antimatroid> i'll see what maps look like once that is done
2011-02-04T21:25:00  <antimatroid> can I change X to '#' for walls?
2011-02-04T21:28:47  <McLeopold> # would be for comments
2011-02-04T21:30:02  <antimatroid> that's what // is for :P
2011-02-04T21:30:21  <antimatroid> i'll leave it as X
2011-02-04T21:32:21  <antimatroid> i'm a fan of player numbers starting from 0 too
2011-02-04T21:32:50  <McLeopold> they should start from 1
2011-02-04T21:32:58  <McLeopold> 0 is land
2011-02-04T21:34:19  <antimatroid> i was using . for land
2011-02-04T21:34:54  <McLeopold> I mean for in the engine, and starter bots.
2011-02-04T21:35:07  <McLeopold> '.' for land in the map files.
2011-02-04T21:38:50  <antimatroid> should maps be symmetric in all four directions? or just symmetric if everyone played exactly the same?
2011-02-04T21:39:24  <McLeopold> just enough that each players starting grid is similar
2011-02-04T21:39:39  <McLeopold> yet maybe not with the same orientation
2011-02-04T21:40:08  <antimatroid> but say you had different opponents left and right of you
2011-02-04T21:40:17  <antimatroid> should it be symmetric for each way you went
2011-02-04T21:40:23  <antimatroid> or just if everyone went "right"?
2011-02-04T21:40:56  <McLeopold> just if everyone when 1 directions, right for some, maybe left or up for others
2011-02-04T21:42:20  <McLeopold> so, for a 1x4 grid, you could have <><> or <<<< but not <<>>
2011-02-04T21:43:01  <McLeopold> for a 2 x 2 grid
