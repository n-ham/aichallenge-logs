2012-03-23T05:26:32  <itzkow> I just had a dream, where the next AI challenge is 20 dimensional tron :O
2012-03-23T05:27:43  <antimatroid> itzkow: it'd be strategically no harder
2012-03-23T05:27:50  <antimatroid> just increasing the state space
2012-03-23T05:28:12  <antimatroid> you just treat it as a graph regardles
2012-03-23T05:28:43  <antimatroid> of course game trees would be less fruitfull
2012-03-23T05:28:52  <itzkow> you will have more choices for your bot
2012-03-23T05:29:11  <itzkow> hard to brute force that way
2012-03-23T05:29:41  <itzkow> I haven't been to the tron contest, so I'm not familiar with the strategies there
2012-03-23T05:31:43  <itzkow> fun dream, anyways :P

2012-03-23T16:19:42  <UncleVasya> Hi Smiley1983. Is client.py for Ants supposed to work with Python 2.7?
2012-03-23T16:22:32  <UncleVasya> I do   tcpclient.py   http://50.116.32.11  2080  MyBot.exe  UncleVasya_final  NotARandomPassword  5  and get an eror message:
2012-03-23T16:23:57  <UncleVasya> File 'python27lib/socket.py' ... getaddrinfo failed
2012-03-23T16:25:08  <Zannick> try removing "http://" ?
2012-03-23T16:31:27  <UncleVasya> yep, thank you. Must be a stupid question.
