2011-10-23T00:02:00  <ashoka> janzert : should we expect attackradius2, viewradius2 and spawnradius2 to change in the course of the tournamnet, or will they be fixed to their current values throughout ?
2011-10-23T00:02:26  <SharkMonkey> Has anyone figured out what spawradius is for?
2011-10-23T00:02:56  <janzert> chances are they won't change but if they do your bot should be able to handle it
2011-10-23T00:03:21  <janzert> SharkMonkey: that is the distance an ant will collect food
2011-10-23T00:04:55  <SharkMonkey> janzert, Aha. Thanks
2011-10-23T00:04:57  <NotCoffeeTable> I can't get clojure to work locally but I if I submit it, it passes tests. Is there anywhere I can get more details on how the server compiles and runs it so i can replicate that environment?
2011-10-23T00:05:00  <Alexer> < Alexer> jmcarthur, but yeah, i've no idea if you should trust that or the visualization :P
2011-10-23T00:05:36  <Alexer> jmcarthur, looking at http://aichallenge.org/game_settings.php apparently the servers use viewradius2 of 77

2011-10-23T00:09:10  <Axoren> Specifically after uploading and tests are run.
2011-10-23T00:09:15  <yoden> (minus the fact the server doesn't seem to want to play matches at the moment)
2011-10-23T00:09:21  <Axoren> I'm getting null pointer exceptions in the main method provided

2011-10-23T00:11:04  <McLeopold> janzert: the main issue is the query to get the match qualities goes from 0.01 seconds to 20-40 seconds when I join with the tmp_games (games in last 24 hours), so I'm going to try and rewrite it without the join

2011-10-23T00:19:50  <otzi> hm
2011-10-23T00:20:01  <SharkMonkey> Which can really cut the size down. Assuming you don't use things with a million dependencies

2011-10-23T01:02:05  <Pawel__> ?????
2011-10-23T01:02:13  <amstan> Pawel__: you have to relax
2011-10-23T01:02:15  <iemand> it added a .ds_store to the tar.gz as well
2011-10-23T01:02:16  <janzert> Pawel__: the game specification has the api
2011-10-23T01:02:17  <iemand> a submission.22.10/.DS_Store
2011-10-23T01:02:33  <SharkMonkey> Pawel__, Also, the python starter kit is well commented and straightforward
2011-10-23T01:02:42  <janzert> iemand: but since it is under the submission directory it shouldn't have hurt
2011-10-23T01:02:56  <amstan> Pawel__: what language are you even talking about?
2011-10-23T01:02:58  <murilo> Next game should be within -0.1 minutes.
2011-10-23T01:03:00  <murilo> Oo
2011-10-23T01:03:05  <Pawel__> Where can u find it - i saw only brief description and no docs - ia m using java
2011-10-23T01:03:22  <otzi> http://ai-contest.com/specification.php
2011-10-23T01:03:27  <SharkMonkey> Pawel__, The api is just text in and text out.
2011-10-23T01:03:30  <otzi> that's what your program has to follow
2011-10-23T01:04:07  <iemand> oh ffs, Compile Error: error while compiling submission
2011-10-23T01:04:11  <otzi> you could write it from ground up, or use the starter packages to help you out
2011-10-23T01:04:14  <iemand> zipped and uploaded with a pc
2011-10-23T01:04:22  <janzert> Pawel__: all bot communication happens on stdio so there is no direct method or function calls
2011-10-23T01:04:34  <iemand> exact same error
2011-10-23T01:05:12  <antimatroid> janzert: do you know how i can make sure a github wiki page makes it onto the specs page on the website? (i want Ants food harvesting to be between cutoff rules and ant spawning)
2011-10-23T01:05:30  <xunie-laptop> Pawel__, you remind me of Mr. Chekov. :P
2011-10-23T01:05:41  <janzert> antimatroid: look at specification.php in the repo

2011-10-23T01:05:45  <Pawel__> thanks. So I don't actually call any methods from main function??? Is that what u mean - sorry if this is a silly question.
2011-10-23T01:05:49  <Pawel__>  Why???
2011-10-23T01:05:55  <janzert> basically it has special comments in the source to insert the wiki pages
2011-10-23T01:06:07  <stano> I'm having a lot of trouble avoiding timeout doing GA per ant
2011-10-23T01:06:09  <otzi> I've read it and I'm using C++ starter package. It has been very easy to follow. I don't know how the Java package is, but I think any package will be small enough that it should be easy to follow.
2011-10-23T01:06:15  <amstan> why is he using so many question marks?
2011-10-23T01:06:46  <Pawel__> sorry
2011-10-23T01:06:49  <murilo> After my status is "ready to play" should I do something to play?
2011-10-23T01:07:16  <ChrisH_> murilo: nope, the server does all the work of making matchups and playing the games
2011-10-23T01:07:17  <janzert> Pawel__: basically you can write the bot however you want, all the interfacing with the engine is done by printing to stdout and reading from stdin
2011-10-23T01:07:30  <antimatroid> janzert: it should just work if i add in the single extra line to that file?
2011-10-23T01:07:42  <ChrisH_> murilo: but it is running slow so be patient, the devs are working on getting it to go faster
2011-10-23T01:07:47  <janzert> antimatroid:  so far as I know yes

2011-10-23T01:14:38  <bobbydroptable> hehehe exactly!
2011-10-23T01:14:54  <ChrisH_> he's gotten 9 or 10 games since the worker came back up

2011-10-23T01:15:15  <janzert> amstan: he's not supposed to be bumped to the front of the line on submission
2011-10-23T01:15:24  <amstan> the manager's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing, give games for the gameless
2011-10-23T01:15:30  <amstan> if he resubmits, he's gameless
2011-10-23T01:15:31  <janzert> no one is
2011-10-23T01:15:32  <ChrisH_> amstan: throttle games on a per player level rather than per submission
2011-10-23T01:15:43  <janzert> no, it's suppose to go by the player's games not the submissions

2011-10-23T01:15:49  <McLeopold> it is per user, not per submission

2011-10-23T01:16:13  <levis501> every time i submitted a new program, i've been immediately scheduled for a game
2011-10-23T01:16:14  <McLeopold> could be, I'll look at it after the speed issue is resolved
2011-10-23T01:16:19  <amstan> we could also send hims an email, to shame him from doing this
2011-10-23T01:16:23  <amstan> till we fix it
2011-10-23T01:16:30  <McLeopold> I wouldn't
2011-10-23T01:16:47  <levis501> but, it resets my rank, so i don't want to do it as my bot gets better

2011-10-23T01:17:42  <iemand> you can't zip a directory with the files in it, you have to select the files and send those to a zipped folder
2011-10-23T01:17:49  <bobbydroptable> maybe there could be a scoring system that penalises high number of submissions?
2011-10-23T01:17:52  <janzert> going to see if I can fix osx zips as well
2011-10-23T01:17:54  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you happy with harvesting as the word for food being removed and placed into an ants hive? also have you considered making spawn2 = 0 now that ants spawn on hills? I think that'd mean food is never "destroyed"?

2011-10-23T01:18:52  <antimatroid> think about spawn2 = 0, i think that's a pretty good idea
2011-10-23T01:19:43  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: that would also mean that ants would need to be allowed to move onto food, which I've heard some people say they are not allowed to do now.
2011-10-23T01:19:46  <Axoren> ChrisH_ what again?
2011-10-23T01:19:55  <Axoren> what did 49 do 'again'?
2011-10-23T01:20:06  <ChrisH_> oh, he's getting too many games
2011-10-23T01:20:14  <antimatroid> although it does make collecting food slightly easier, as you don't have to worry about the possibility of some shortest paths collecting up to 3 food items simultaneously
2011-10-23T01:20:19  <ChrisH_> by  making lots of submissions
2011-10-23T01:20:50  <McLeopold> oh crap
2011-10-23T01:21:05  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: I don't care as far as my bots go, but the engine may need a tweek if spawnradius2 = 0, that's all I was saying
2011-10-23T01:21:21  <ashoka> McLeopold : I was also going to point something similar to what Chrish mentioned. ranking page looks bit odd this time. see everybody in top 10-20, has got around same number of games
2011-10-23T01:21:24  <antimatroid> yeah i know what you meant, i was just making an observation :)

2011-10-23T01:22:48  <ashoka> McLeopold : although that looks fair, they have submited their versions at different times. so bit unusual how all get end up playing about same number of games. I think the scheduler is pushing recent submitters on top and then continue with them until they get about same number of games as others.
2011-10-23T01:22:49  <ChrisH_> ashoka: I think that's what we want, roughly equal distribution of games
2011-10-23T01:22:57  <Axoren> I'd like that :D
2011-10-23T01:23:16  <McLeopold> janzert / amstan: specification.php is modified on the server?
2011-10-23T01:23:21  <ashoka> McLeopold : oh, you have already fixed :-)
2011-10-23T01:23:30  <amstan> McLeopold: i didn't
2011-10-23T01:23:30  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i did that, did i break it?
2011-10-23T01:23:33  <bobbydroptable> so what does spawn2 = 0 do again?
2011-10-23T01:23:43  <bobbydroptable> oh you mean spawnradius2
2011-10-23T01:23:46  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: was totally right, I messed up and order by most game :(
2011-10-23T01:23:59  <amstan> McLeopold: they're modded because of the setup script
2011-10-23T01:24:01  <ChrisH_> ouch
2011-10-23T01:24:06  <bobbydroptable> lol ouch
2011-10-23T01:24:11  <McLeopold> amstan: no, this is different I think
2011-10-23T01:24:13  <amstan> McLeopold: feel free to git reset them, just ./setup.py when finished
2011-10-23T01:24:17  <ashoka> Chrish : it can't be. in this case there are people who have submitted 2 days ago, and people who submited just 2 hours ago. how can they both get the same number of total games after 2 hours ? :-)

2011-10-23T01:25:49  <otzi> yeah, but what is spawn radius?
2011-10-23T01:25:50  <antimatroid> it should really be called something like harvestRadius now it was left from before hills
2011-10-23T01:25:56  <ChrisH_> Question of today: "What does spawnradius2 mean?"
2011-10-23T01:26:21  <bobbydroptable> a relic from the beta apparently
2011-10-23T01:26:26  <ChrisH_> it is the radius an ant has to get within a food in order to spawn a new ant in the hive
2011-10-23T01:26:37  <bysin> read tools/ants.py line 659
2011-10-23T01:26:39  <Axoren> OH!
2011-10-23T01:26:41  <janzert> McLeopold: yes, that comes up whenever a file in the repo gets updated that is expanded on the server by setup.py
2011-10-23T01:26:41  <bysin> theres a comment that describes it
2011-10-23T01:26:42  <ChrisH_> radius^2 really
2011-10-23T01:26:47  <ashoka> Chrish : Servers got slow due to pairing issue. probably it's the match making algorithm giving more priority to newer submitters, I don't know but top 20 odd playes who have submitted their versions days apart are unlikely to get the same number of games if the game rate is evenly distributed.
2011-10-23T01:26:52  <McLeopold> we could change that to foodradius or gatherradius or harvestradius, but it might be too late
2011-10-23T01:27:07  <Axoren> That can make my bot 1 turn faster per farmer ant, effectively
2011-10-23T01:27:17  <otzi> ChrisH_: so if the food is within the spawn radius the ant will eat it? I see.
2011-10-23T01:27:21  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-food-harvesting that explains the radius
2011-10-23T01:27:40  <Axoren> I've been programming them to use A* from their last unemployed position to the closest food's location, rather than adjacent to it.
2011-10-23T01:27:43  <bobbydroptable> but how much does that actually impact ai , really...
2011-10-23T01:27:47  <ChrisH_> ashoka: there are two aspects to the scheduling, one is that every player gets an equal number of chances to be the "seed" player for any given game, then there is the method of chosing who else should be in that game.
2011-10-23T01:27:52  <janzert> I think spawnradius2 has to stay but it could be undocumented with a better named paramater that means the same thing also sent
2011-10-23T01:27:53  <bobbydroptable> i just tell ants to move towards food

2011-10-23T01:29:20  <antimatroid> McLeopold: we can, i just thought harvest actually captured the notion of removing the food and placing it into the hive better, i think of gathering/collecting food as the whole process of moving to and picking up the food, but i don't mind
2011-10-23T01:29:41  <ChrisH_> ashoka: so the scheduling is a pretty dynamic system
2011-10-23T01:31:10  <antimatroid> i'm also not sure of using exist and distinct, you might want to make that a bit less mathsy
2011-10-23T01:31:11  <ChrisH_> ashoka: but constraints were put into place to prevent players from getting too many games by not scheduling them (except as game seeds) if their # of games gets too far ahead of the rest of the field, and that constraint is what has leveled the numbers you are talking about

2011-10-23T01:34:11  <Six> far more interesting that way
2011-10-23T01:34:19  <antimatroid> in other words if you hard code parameters and we need to change it for whatever reason, you should not complain to us that your bot no longer works :P

2011-10-23T01:34:52  <antimatroid> otzi: planet wars and tron were both last year, ants was intended to be done earlier in the year but it took longer than we expected to make due to contributers time contraints
2011-10-23T01:34:59  <ChrisH_> Axoren: it's a bug
2011-10-23T01:35:10  <J0KRESTER> just a question, but does the tutorial http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial.php instruction here work on a mac as well... I cant seem to get it to work without changing the instructions slightly....
2011-10-23T01:35:18  <ChrisH_> it means that player just uploaded new code, but it hasn't been compiled yet

2011-10-23T01:35:54  <otzi> antimatroid: I see. Were they also this sophisticated with a pretty user interface and all that?
2011-10-23T01:36:01  <Six> Kirby shall compile the code with the power of dance
2011-10-23T01:36:21  <antimatroid> no, the visualiser for this contest goes above and beyond those from planet wars and tron
2011-10-23T01:37:09  <antimatroid> and so do a few other things
2011-10-23T01:37:19  <ChrisH_> I thought the planet wars visualizer was pretty.
2011-10-23T01:37:28  <ChrisH_> but the game was simpler
2011-10-23T01:37:31  <bobbydroptable> yeh i know i meant that
2011-10-23T01:37:34  <antimatroid> yeah it was cool, but i don't think it was as sophisticated as the ants one
2011-10-23T01:37:40  <Axoren> knowing this spawn radius stuff makes my bot so much faster
2011-10-23T01:37:42  <bobbydroptable> spawnradius2 doesn't seem like a significant factor
2011-10-23T01:37:44  <ChrisH_> it has less to do
2011-10-23T01:38:05  <bobbydroptable> i suppose you could say "stop pathfinding if distance less than radius"?
2011-10-23T01:38:07  <antimatroid> bobbydroptable: you need to know which squares around food you need to find a shortest path to in order to harvest it
2011-10-23T01:38:07  <otzi> I was amazed by it. I was expecting it to be just text input and output when I heard about it :P

2011-10-23T01:38:33  <bobbydroptable> antimatroid why can't you just search directly to the food ?
2011-10-23T01:38:33  <murilo> I give up... 3:38AM
2011-10-23T01:38:44  <Axoren> if my ants are spending an extra turn gathering, they aren't actively attacking enemy ants
2011-10-23T01:38:46  <antimatroid> if spawnradius2>= 2 then it's possibly to harvest across water/diagonals
2011-10-23T01:38:48  <otzi> wow
2011-10-23T01:38:55  <bobbydroptable> mmmm .
2011-10-23T01:38:59  <Axoren> that's a big deal
2011-10-23T01:39:12  <Axoren> it only takes one turn to raze a hill
2011-10-23T01:39:13  <bobbydroptable> that is a good point , harvesting over water
2011-10-23T01:39:25  <otzi> it is 3h40 indeed. I hate daylight saving time :(
2011-10-23T01:39:51  <bobbydroptable> Axoren: if your bot moves within the radius of the food, the food will be gone, so it won't spend any extra turns?
2011-10-23T01:40:00  <Axoren> yes
2011-10-23T01:40:20  <bobbydroptable> ah never mind *shrug* its my bot lol
2011-10-23T01:40:28  <Axoren> but if you spend an extra turn moving ONTO the tile that had the food, that's an issue
2011-10-23T01:40:51  <murilo> otzi: same here...
2011-10-23T01:40:55  <Axoren> My bot does a lot more Search and Destroy
2011-10-23T01:41:10  <bobbydroptable> ah you're talking about high level strategy, not algorithms
2011-10-23T01:41:30  <bobbydroptable> but then an extra move would apply to everyone

2011-10-23T01:42:37  <Axoren> you mean an extra move would apply to everyone using an algorithm that assumed you needed to land on a food tile to take it
2011-10-23T01:42:37  <Saulzar> Hmm - someone posted an improved haskell starter kit here https://github.com/qacek/ants-haskell/

2011-10-23T01:43:29  <janzert> ok, Mac zips should work now
2011-10-23T01:43:34  <Axoren> my algorithm just spends an extra turn saying "I already picked the food up, but I'm still going to move into that space.
2011-10-23T01:43:47  <bobbydroptable> ah
2011-10-23T01:44:04  <bobbydroptable> i compute every ant's behaviour on every move
2011-10-23T01:44:18  <bobbydroptable> because i couldn't be stuffed trying to track every ant's state lol
2011-10-23T01:44:25  <Axoren> That leads to timeouts if you end up with too many ants
2011-10-23T01:44:31  <bobbydroptable> so far it's worked ok :D
2011-10-23T01:44:53  <bobbydroptable> i'm not sure how my modifications will fare, when the time comes
2011-10-23T01:45:09  <ChrisH_> Axoren: speak for yourself, I do the same and don't timeout

2011-10-23T01:45:58  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-23T01:46:27  <Axoren> I just hope my A* algorithm works quickly
2011-10-23T01:46:33  <Six> anyone seen any map prediction going on based on the symmetry
2011-10-23T01:46:33  <Alexer> Axoren, i do that too. as a precaution i check how much time i have after each path calculation and bail out if it seems i might run out (thus some of my ants might stop on their tracks for a few turns if i ever came close to the timeout)
2011-10-23T01:46:53  <bobbydroptable> Alexer: python starter kit does this
2011-10-23T01:46:58  <a1k0n> Six: brilliant idae
2011-10-23T01:47:04  <Six> A* is easy to screw up and turn into an infinate loop
2011-10-23T01:47:11  <ChrisH_> Bot code can run very fast if you cache the results of certain computations that are always the same for a given board.
2011-10-23T01:47:25  <bobbydroptable> Six: some guy was trying to do something like this , but he wanted to upload all the official maps

2011-10-23T01:48:02  <Axoren> If I ever get a situation where my bot ends up doing too much pathfinding in one turn, I'll have a huge issue
2011-10-23T01:48:21  <bobbydroptable> my first bot only does a* within it's field of vision
2011-10-23T01:48:29  <bobbydroptable> so i have this problem where my ants don't know what to do
2011-10-23T01:48:34  <bobbydroptable> when there's nothing around them lol
2011-10-23T01:48:40  <bobbydroptable> my 2nd bot is trying to solve that =="
2011-10-23T01:48:40  <Axoren> Make them lemmings
2011-10-23T01:48:54  <Axoren> when mine have that issue, they weigh a tile by how close it is to other ants/hills
2011-10-23T01:48:54  <bobbydroptable> at least lemmings walk in a straight line =="
2011-10-23T01:48:56  <Axoren> and runs away
2011-10-23T01:49:06  <Axoren> Xenophobic ants, ftw
2011-10-23T01:49:18  <bobbydroptable> how do they attack?
2011-10-23T01:49:19  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-23T01:49:28  <Alexer> Axoren, won't they all path to the same places then?
2011-10-23T01:49:50  <Axoren> No, I make sure that tiles already part of a "job" are weighted heavily
2011-10-23T01:50:31  <Axoren> they will also wait until an ant moves away from their target location
2011-10-23T01:50:42  <Axoren> giving the ant occupying that location time to run away like a xenophobe or acquire a new job
2011-10-23T01:51:10  <Alexer> i haven't yet decided what to do about the idle problem (rationally)
2011-10-23T01:51:13  <Axoren> Also, attacks only happen when food is not present and enemies are visible.
2011-10-23T01:51:22  <Axoren> If neither is present, xenophobia
2011-10-23T01:51:30  <bobbydroptable> right so you run away from your own ants
2011-10-23T01:51:31  <Axoren> if none of the above are possible, random direction
2011-10-23T01:51:39  <Alexer> i had to do something, so currently they just use a longest-path algorithm and run in circles like headless chickens :D
2011-10-23T01:52:19  <Alexer> so they path to the other end of the area they see, then back to the other end
2011-10-23T01:52:29  <bobbydroptable> learnt a new vim shortcut - Ctrl I
2011-10-23T01:52:35  <bobbydroptable> why did i not know this before =="
2011-10-23T01:52:43  <Alexer> which is totally awesome in maze maps xD

2011-10-23T01:53:15  <Axoren> but following walls leads to ants killing eachother without lots of traffic control
2011-10-23T01:53:30  <Axoren> and then, you miss large open areas filled with food
2011-10-23T01:53:32  <Alexer> slows exploration down damn much when they keep running back to the hill continuously :D
2011-10-23T01:53:56  <bobbydroptable> you might be able to do "left wall" with some weighting
2011-10-23T01:54:11  <bobbydroptable> for each water square, weight surrounding squares by 1
2011-10-23T01:54:12  <Axoren> I think I might add an alarm feature
2011-10-23T01:54:23  <bobbydroptable> if square weight > 2 then don't go there
2011-10-23T01:54:30  <Axoren> if an unemployed ant sees an enemy, warn all ants and change their jobs to attack

2011-10-23T01:55:52  <bobbydroptable> how do you keep track of your ants, axoren
2011-10-23T01:55:52  <Axoren> draw dicks with my ants when food and enemies aren't present
2011-10-23T01:56:07  <Axoren> I don't keep track of them per se.
2011-10-23T01:56:17  <Axoren> I tell them to do something and they ask for another job when they're done
2011-10-23T01:56:25  <antimatroid> now i want to see dick formations go into battle with each other
2011-10-23T01:56:30  <bobbydroptable> that implies they have their own state right?
2011-10-23T01:56:35  <antimatroid> or stream ants out the end at each other
2011-10-23T01:56:36  <Alexer> *goes to watch replay* -> ants of the other bot write "your bot sucks"
2011-10-23T01:56:59  <Axoren> I have a HashMap<Tile, Path> where Path is a SinglyLinkedList of Directions
2011-10-23T01:57:37  <bobbydroptable> ah
2011-10-23T01:57:42  <Axoren> When they reach the end of a Path, their Path is null
2011-10-23T01:57:51  <Axoren> When a Path is null, I find something for them to do
2011-10-23T01:58:05  <bobbydroptable> and each ant has their own hashmap?
2011-10-23T01:58:10  <bobbydroptable> wait no that still doesn't work...
2011-10-23T01:58:12  <Axoren> Nope
2011-10-23T01:58:17  <Axoren> The Bot has the hashmap
2011-10-23T01:58:22  <Axoren> The ants are the keys
2011-10-23T01:58:46  <bobbydroptable> yeh that's the part i still don't like, because the keys change making it difficult to keep track ^^
2011-10-23T01:58:49  <Axoren> when an ant moves, they remove the job mapping and make a new one at their new location
2011-10-23T01:59:40  <Axoren> Think about this: define Path { Path next; Tile/Direction place; }
2011-10-23T01:59:55  <bobbydroptable> nah i get it you put their task in the tile they're going to appear next
2011-10-23T01:59:58  <ChrisH_> Axoren: what do you do if an enemy ant gets in the way of your path after you've planned it?
2011-10-23T02:00:25  <Axoren> I let the job float
2011-10-23T02:01:08  <Axoren> I could probably do some cleanup at the beginning of the turn to remove floating jobs
2011-10-23T02:01:19  <Axoren> but this leads to an unexpected, nice side effect.
2011-10-23T02:01:29  <Axoren> Another ant will guard the location of a dead ally
2011-10-23T02:01:38  <bobbydroptable> that other ants can come by and pick up the floating job if it comes across it?
2011-10-23T02:01:39  <Axoren> waiting for more enemies, almost

2011-10-23T02:03:07  <ChrisH_> I missed that part
2011-10-23T02:03:09  <Axoren> it'll happen automatically by having ants run away from eachother when not doing gathering
2011-10-23T02:03:16  <ChrisH_> oh
2011-10-23T02:03:39  <Axoren> This is my first attempt at any AI
2011-10-23T02:03:43  <ChrisH_> does that ever push ants into dead ends?
2011-10-23T02:03:45  <Axoren> but I play a lot of video games
2011-10-23T02:03:53  <Axoren> Some times!
2011-10-23T02:04:08  <Axoren> But if they cannot run away from allies
2011-10-23T02:04:08  <ChrisH_> something to think about then
2011-10-23T02:04:11  <Axoren> they pick a random direction

2011-10-23T02:04:45  <ChrisH_> maybe it shouldn't be random, maybe it should be targeted at unknown territory
2011-10-23T02:05:09  <Axoren> That's difficult with my variation of the A*
2011-10-23T02:05:20  <Axoren> I'd have to use an uninformed variant like D*

2011-10-23T02:06:04  <ChrisH_> My bot considers unknown area as all land, then replans each turn based on any new information

2011-10-23T02:06:18  <Axoren> I'm very insecure and minor accomplishments are important to me

2011-10-23T02:11:37  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-23T02:11:43  <Dominater> is there any way to access the files?
2011-10-23T02:11:46  <bobbydroptable> dominater : no you can NOT write to files .

2011-10-23T02:12:16  <bobbydroptable> you can access files you upload
2011-10-23T02:12:19  <janzert> yay :)
2011-10-23T02:12:22  <bobbydroptable> but they cannot be modified
2011-10-23T02:12:37  <janzert> any objection to removing extended game recording?
2011-10-23T02:12:55  <McLeopold> janzert: plus, i did sort on the wrong column for the first part of the contest, now games should be even
2011-10-23T02:12:55  <Axoren> ... wait?
2011-10-23T02:12:55  <Alexer> Axoren, i had a bug at some point where my pathfinding checked the neighbouring squares for obstructions, then if it found the square on the left to be accessible, it queued the square on the right to be checked :D
2011-10-23T02:13:07  <janzert> McLeopold: great

2011-10-23T02:13:35  <Axoren> Can we somehow detect which map is being used :3?
2011-10-23T02:13:41  <Alexer> Axoren, copypaste error, didn't notice it since 'r' and 'l' are close enough. it took me forever to track it down even with local testing
2011-10-23T02:13:41  <janzert> McLeopold: right
2011-10-23T02:13:58  <bobbydroptable> axoren: there's no guarantee that the maps will be one of the standard ones?
2011-10-23T02:14:03  <McLeopold> I think amstan and I outvoted you on that :)
2011-10-23T02:14:16  <janzert> an example of the bug is http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=2695&user=1 it is recorded as different, should be same
2011-10-23T02:14:18  <Axoren> Not so much that I want guarantees that they will be the standard ones
2011-10-23T02:14:29  <janzert> but we're still recording them atm
2011-10-23T02:14:36  <Axoren> but if I knew which map the bot was on, I could orient more search and destory with more move and destroy :P
2011-10-23T02:14:42  <janzert> I just want to get rid of that
2011-10-23T02:15:26  <McLeopold> just the description?
2011-10-23T02:15:28  <Axoren> I might just make my bots explore just enough to determine which map it is, then load from a file the entire map's layout
2011-10-23T02:15:40  <Axoren> each map's layout being stored in a file
2011-10-23T02:15:42  <janzert> righ, the game end reason
2011-10-23T02:15:43  <Axoren> :P
2011-10-23T02:15:46  <McLeopold> okay

2011-10-23T02:16:41  <ChrisH_> Axoren: you will be disappointed to learn that if they do the same thing as previous competitions there will be all new maps for the finals that you won't know about until after submissions are frozen

2011-10-23T02:17:26  <Axoren> But using a D* until I know what map it is will mean I continue to use D* even if I never find out
2011-10-23T02:17:32  <Axoren> maintaining efficiency
2011-10-23T02:17:44  <janzert> and worker task results come back nice and fast :)
2011-10-23T02:17:47  <Axoren> all I'd have to do is set a "give up"
2011-10-23T02:17:54  <ChrisH_> Axoren: my point is that your cache of the "official maps" will be invalidated when they change all the maps for the finals
2011-10-23T02:18:07  <Axoren> ALL of them?
2011-10-23T02:18:10  <ChrisH_> yep

2011-10-23T02:18:22  <Axoren> will there be more competitions in the future?
2011-10-23T02:18:30  <ChrisH_> hopefully
2011-10-23T02:18:56  <Axoren> Then I'm cool with that
2011-10-23T02:18:57  <ChrisH_> the idea is to write code that adapts well to its environment, not pre-optimized for a static environment
2011-10-23T02:19:07  <McLeopold> janzert: the change looks good

2011-10-23T02:24:05  <ChrisH_> I've seen this several times before, and it always seems to go away, but I have no idea what causes it
2011-10-23T02:24:14  <McLeopold> me neither :(

2011-10-23T02:25:40  <ChrisH_> I think the lack of formatting is a symptom, though, cause that's the result of click the bad links
2011-10-23T02:26:00  <ChrisH_> yeah, that's the problem I was referring to

2011-10-23T02:28:56  <Alexer> Axoren, does it work if you do just "C:\Python27>java -jar M:\Ants\MyBot.jar"?
2011-10-23T02:29:16  <janzert> McLeopold: I thought so, but now that I look at them I don't see that he has anything modified there
2011-10-23T02:29:27  <Alexer> Axoren, as in, it should start without errors but not give any output (since it doesn't get input..)
2011-10-23T02:29:45  <McLeopold> janzert: can you reproduce it?  I think it's a special combination of clicks
2011-10-23T02:30:12  <McLeopold> gotit
2011-10-23T02:30:15  <janzert> or memcache is getting messed up somehow?

2011-10-23T02:49:55  <McLeopold> give me a user_id that you think has lots of games
2011-10-23T02:50:27  <ChrisH_> I have a feeling you are right McLeopold , but I'll keep looking around.
2011-10-23T02:50:44  <McLeopold> we've had so few games, that most everyone is considered as having "no games" as far as keeping it even goes
2011-10-23T02:50:50  <janzert> ahh, no. not all of them had games within 24 hours
2011-10-23T02:50:52  <McLeopold> in the last 24 hours
2011-10-23T02:51:09  <janzert> but seeds shouldn't be limited to 24 hour games should they?
2011-10-23T02:51:17  <McLeopold> that means their lower sigma, which is 3rd in line, is taking over
2011-10-23T02:51:19  <janzert> although it shouldn't make a difference normally
2011-10-23T02:51:28  <McLeopold> janzert: no, seeds are not
2011-10-23T02:51:35  <McLeopold> seeds are least recently played
2011-10-23T02:51:40  <janzert> so there is still a problem
2011-10-23T02:51:49  <McLeopold> that's why you should have at least one in there that looks good

2011-10-23T02:52:20  <janzert> is the one I'm looking at
2011-10-23T02:52:40  <McLeopold> seed_id was 1793, with 3 games in last 24
2011-10-23T02:52:50  <janzert> :(
2011-10-23T02:53:08  <janzert> and that's the player with the new submission
2011-10-23T02:53:32  <McLeopold> yep
2011-10-23T02:53:34  <ChrisH_> hmmm
2011-10-23T02:53:41  <ChrisH_> sounds fishy. ;)
2011-10-23T02:54:09  <ChrisH_> and his previous game was just minutes for that game too
2011-10-23T02:54:13  *** he_the_great <he_the_great!~he_the_gr@173-202-192-80.dyn.centurytel.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-10-23T02:54:29  <janzert> yep, problem is in seed query
2011-10-23T02:54:35  <McLeopold> I know the issue...fixing
2011-10-23T02:54:46  <janzert> limits the submission to latest and then orders by submission max_game_id
2011-10-23T02:54:48  <janzert> ok
2011-10-23T02:55:06  <McLeopold> yeah, max_game_id used to be a query across all the games
2011-10-23T02:55:24  <McLeopold> I switched it for speed, but it had an unintended consequence :(
2011-10-23T02:55:44  <janzert> if you can find the latest submission with a game it would work
2011-10-23T02:56:02  <McLeopold> it should be any game, I just need to make sure it is fast
2011-10-23T02:56:31  <ChrisH_> while were here debugging, I found the line of code that produces the weird (>") rank for new submissions on the first page of ranks, but I'm not enough of a .php expert, nor do I know your web architecture well enough to fix it.
2011-10-23T02:56:51  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: it's a query issue
2011-10-23T02:56:55  <janzert> those wierd ranks are called ghosts
2011-10-23T02:57:06  <a1k0n> what causes them?  disqualification?
2011-10-23T02:57:09  <janzert> they just shouldn't be showing up for new players
2011-10-23T02:57:14  <Axoren> How do I fix: "Unable to access jarfile MyBot" when using the TCP server?
2011-10-23T02:57:18  <ChrisH_> yeah, and when they are on there you can't use the sort columns either

2011-10-23T03:40:49  <bobbydroptable> yeh
2011-10-23T03:40:50  <burny> is the only way to win this: to kill the most hills?

2011-10-23T03:41:16  <bobbydroptable> burny yup
2011-10-23T03:41:32  <McLeopold> burny: do the specs need to be more clear?
2011-10-23T03:41:44  <klasbj> Hi, I was hoping someone could help me to get my code to compile with C++11? (STL hash sets are nice...) According to the README in the starter pack the server should try to use the Makefile I submit in my zip file, where I have included the -std=c++0x flag, but it doesn't compile, because the -std=c++0x flag is not present. Is it not possible to use C++11 for this challenge, or is there some was around it?
2011-10-23T03:42:31  <burny> they're clear enoug hI suppose, it just seems odd, that creating an army, and killing ants, doesn't give points
2011-10-23T03:42:40  <ChrisH_> janzert: looks like we lost a worker
2011-10-23T03:42:42  <janzert> klasbj: the server does not use your makefile
2011-10-23T03:42:45  <bobbydroptable> yeh maybe there should have been a bonus for having the most ants at the end of the game
2011-10-23T03:42:48  <McLeopold> how is that odd?
2011-10-23T03:42:59  <janzert> McLeopold: workers are getting blank tasks
2011-10-23T03:43:22  <burny> 'seems' odd

2011-10-23T03:43:56  <janzert> ChrisH_: they're just unable to get tasks from the main server
2011-10-23T03:44:22  <ChrisH_> oh, so if they're rate drops too low they disappear from the stats page?
2011-10-23T03:44:41  <janzert> yep, if the rate drops to 0 they're gone
2011-10-23T03:44:48  <ChrisH_> ok
2011-10-23T03:44:52  <klasbj> janzert: Ok, I figured as much, a bit annoying when the readme in the starter pack says it should... Do you know if there is any way to tell the server to compule it with certain flags?

2011-10-23T03:47:24  <boegel> janzert: not sure how that works...
2011-10-23T03:47:52  <janzert> ahh, the main repo just needs the submodule to be updated then
2011-10-23T03:48:12  <janzert> I can never remember how to do that though :/
2011-10-23T03:48:17  <boegel> janzert: and how should I trigger that?
2011-10-23T03:48:20  <boegel> janzert: ah :)
2011-10-23T03:48:27  <janzert> ask amstan is the best way ;)
2011-10-23T03:48:39  <boegel> janzert: also, seems like some more work is needed for the starter package to be complete, like McLeopold pointed out
2011-10-23T03:49:56  <janzert> seeing I know pretty much 0 haskell I don't have a chance of helping with that
2011-10-23T03:50:41  <SofiaWhite> Hi guys
2011-10-23T03:50:53  <bobbydroptable> hello
2011-10-23T03:51:12  <SofiaWhite> Are you aware of any trick to better debug the bot?
2011-10-23T03:51:22  <bobbydroptable> output debugging messages to error output
2011-10-23T03:51:26  <bobbydroptable> which language?
2011-10-23T03:51:49  <SofiaWhite> I'm using C# and it seems there's no way to trace/debug live?
2011-10-23T03:52:26  <bobbydroptable> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console.error.aspx
2011-10-23T03:52:32  <SofiaWhite> Well, I don't even see the bot console window
2011-10-23T03:52:39  <bobbydroptable> oh
2011-10-23T03:52:49  <bobbydroptable> i don't have the C# starter pack so i don't know how it is done
2011-10-23T03:52:56  <bobbydroptable> so you don't run it on the command line?

2011-10-23T03:53:11  <bobbydroptable> do you run it in visual studio?
2011-10-23T03:53:43  <SofiaWhite> hmm, where does the standard error output output when you don't see the app window and can't attach your debugger?
2011-10-23T03:54:10  <janzert> SofiaWhite: the engine will capture the bots stderr and output it to the same console as the engine is being run in
2011-10-23T03:54:11  <SofiaWhite> I run it both from Windows Explorer and command prompt
2011-10-23T03:54:27  <bobbydroptable> it runs as a console app I believe?
2011-10-23T03:54:33  <bobbydroptable> if you run it from command prompt
2011-10-23T03:54:51  <SofiaWhite> I see janzert. I guess that's what bobby is also saying.  I'll try that and come back. Thanks
2011-10-23T03:55:21  <SofiaWhite> yep, it does. I'll try to output to stderr

2011-10-23T04:01:57  <bobbydroptable> skill level determines rank, no?
2011-10-23T04:02:10  <bobbydroptable> rank is just the numerical index of the order of skill levles
2011-10-23T04:02:13  <SharkMonkey> I have no idea. Sometimes one goes up while the other goes down
2011-10-23T04:02:36  <SharkMonkey> How is skill determined?
2011-10-23T04:02:49  <bobbydroptable> apparently, http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/
2011-10-23T04:03:02  <bobbydroptable> don't forget your rank can fall if someone gets a higher skill level
2011-10-23T04:03:08  <bobbydroptable> even if your skill went up

2011-10-23T04:06:07  <vladimirfol> hello! i just want to ask. How you solve fast calculation ants ways problem? I think i can create graph of map areas(each 5 cells i think) and connections of them.
2011-10-23T04:06:20  <bobbydroptable> i am trying that too
2011-10-23T04:06:24  <bobbydroptable> but iti s proving difficult
2011-10-23T04:06:35  <bobbydroptable> because paths may not fit into cell
2011-10-23T04:06:38  <bobbydroptable> for example
2011-10-23T04:06:53  <bobbydroptable> if you have a 5 cell area, separated by water
2011-10-23T04:06:58  <McLeopold> janzert: back in business
2011-10-23T04:07:04  <janzert> great
2011-10-23T04:07:07  <bobbydroptable> you can have areas in that cell that cannot find path to the center of the area
2011-10-23T04:07:32  <bobbydroptable> for calculating any form of paths, suggest looking at A* for rudimentary algorithm

2011-10-23T04:09:24  <vladimirfol> <bobbydroptable> i think about it, in every area will be only cell that visible for ant (if he stau in center of area) and that possible to get (in 5 steps)
2011-10-23T04:11:40  <vladimirfol> each area will know about neighbors, if ant stay to cell that not belong to any area, than i will create new area with center in this cell, calculate cell belongs to the area and insert the area to the graph
2011-10-23T04:11:43  <Pawel__> sorry guys - but i am not very good with linux :-). In  this tutorial on how to test our bots - it says to create some script by pasting a command line. I guess it opens up an editor of some sort were i supposed to write the lines that are given - simple. But how on earth can I save it and go back to the shell ??

2011-10-23T04:34:38  <janzert> 924 as well
2011-10-23T04:34:49  <Pawel__> Hello guys - really sorry for trouble - that's me again: I went through tutorial and i've done it - it works (The test) - but it throughs exceptions and cannot find my class "MyBot" ("Could not find the main class: MyBot. Program will exit.") - I checked it was there - so why it could not find it? should I add it to my path or something?
2011-10-23T04:35:43  <janzert> that looks like a language runtime error?
2011-10-23T04:36:15  <cyphase> i've only submitted the starter program and i'm 850 out of ~1600. is that just chance, or have hundreds of people submitted bots worse than the starter bot?
2011-10-23T04:36:17  <Pawel__> yes - loads of java exceptions - but all are ClassNotDefined error type
2011-10-23T04:36:23  <Belerafon_L> Hi. I'm a new. I have compile C++ version of ants, but can't run it. That parameters line I need to set on terminal? (loadtime, turntime and etc.)
2011-10-23T04:36:44  <cyphase> Belerafon_L, that's passed in on stdin
2011-10-23T04:36:45  <Puj> Set your classpath to the dir where your Java files are and run java full_path_to_MyBot
2011-10-23T04:37:21  <Pawel__> ok thanks - i will do it . Thanks for help.

2011-10-23T04:42:27  <AlvinMinring> they'll feed your program with the right input
2011-10-23T04:42:39  <cyphase> xor__, there's a time limit per turn

2011-10-23T04:44:31  <Puj> Belerafon_L, either install Python and use the tools or just dl them and copy the parameters you would like to use.  The have good command line examples. But installing Python is relatively painless.

2011-10-23T05:08:29  <ChrisH_> bobbydroptable and SharkMonkey: I will also add that a lot of the top players competed in the previous ai challenge, so they have experience with some of the techniques. This makes it easier for them to zero in on their implementation without as much trial and error.

2011-10-23T05:56:49  <awishformore> this might be a really stupid question as i am getting started
2011-10-23T05:57:00  <awishformore> but why are all the radii passed as squared values?
2011-10-23T05:58:19  <levis501> when you calculate a distance, just do dx^2 + dy^2 to get a distance squared
2011-10-23T05:58:43  <SharkMonkey> awishformore, When you calculate the distance between two points you do sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2). Instead you can skip doing the square root and just campare the value against the squared radius
2011-10-23T05:58:48  <levis501> saves having to do a sqrt() which can be computationally expensive
2011-10-23T05:59:13  <cyphase> what's the dotted line around ant hills in the visualizer?

2011-10-23T07:16:52  <AndrewBC> (been reading so much ASoIaF that I'm starting to talk like it :|)
2011-10-23T07:17:06  <delt0r_> ASoIaF?
2011-10-23T07:17:08  <Alexer> delt0r_, new rules?
2011-10-23T07:17:16  <AndrewBC> A Song of Ice and Fire
2011-10-23T07:17:28  <cyphase> the game of thrones book series
2011-10-23T07:17:30  <cyphase> "oooh"
2011-10-23T07:17:37  <AndrewBC> pretty good fantasy series for th- ^ what he said
2011-10-23T07:17:41  <delt0r_> Alexer: the rules in the beta where change quite drastically about 2-3 weeks ago
2011-10-23T07:17:42  <GreenTea> olexs, maby on http://ash.webfactional.com, aim not play on it yet.
2011-10-23T07:18:14  <Alexer> delt0r_, ah....
2011-10-23T07:18:18  <delt0r_> oh right books from games --interesting. I tried to read a book based on Eve Online. It kinda sucked
2011-10-23T07:18:30  <cyphase> delt0r_, umm
2011-10-23T07:18:40  <olexs> GreenTea: I'll begin working on my bot again next week, it's unmodified since the hills were introduced in the beta right now... I'll play you then :)
2011-10-23T07:18:41  <cyphase> delt0r_, gae of thrones is a tv series based on the books
2011-10-23T07:18:44  <cyphase> game*
2011-10-23T07:18:48  <delt0r_> oh
2011-10-23T07:18:49  <AndrewBC> nah, Game of Thrones is the first book of the series, and also the name of the tv show
2011-10-23T07:19:09  <AndrewBC> which is also good, mind you
2011-10-23T07:19:14  <Alexer> GreenTea, you can just let your bot running indefinitely. at some point it'll bump into a good bot, hopefully :P
2011-10-23T07:19:42  <Alexer> if people just remember to advertise the tcp servers occasionally >:P
2011-10-23T07:19:57  <GreenTea> olexs, ok) 7 place for unmidified bot its very good
2011-10-23T07:20:14  *** onensora <onensora!~c@e198153.upc-e.chello.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-23T07:20:39  <AlvinMinring_> So, naive question here: how stable can we assume the rules to be? Like, can we assume that the view radius is greater than the attack radius? Are these values going to get determined once and for all some time down the road, or could they vary from game to game even in the latest stages of the challenge?
2011-10-23T07:20:51  <olexs> GreenTea: the last mod I did was going for a hill kill when it's safe. there is no defence and no pathfinding optimizations for mazes at all... but it does better than I expected
2011-10-23T07:21:11  <delt0r_> AlliedEnvy_: if its a parameter that you get passed you should assume that it can be somewhat fluid
2011-10-23T07:21:37  <delt0r_> but basic constraints like view distance being grater than kill distance is a safe bet
2011-10-23T07:21:40  *** AlliedEnvy_ is now known as AlliedEnvy
2011-10-23T07:21:53  <delt0r_> can't think why that would ever be different.
2011-10-23T07:22:07  <olexs> AlvinMinring_: the values were stabilized in the beta, and most probably will not change until the challenge is over
2011-10-23T07:22:12  <GreenTea> olexs, cool, I make special algorithm for exloration of mazes. but it is still not perfect..
2011-10-23T07:22:23  <AlvinMinring_> ok, interesting, thanks
2011-10-23T07:22:27  <delt0r_> AlliedEnvy: the reason is last time around there really needed to be some tweaking in the parameters. Too many hard coded stuff based on that
2011-10-23T07:22:32  <UncleVasya> GreenTea: I saw you have tried lisp :)
2011-10-23T07:22:48  <Belerafon_L> Can anybody give me executable working version of ants bot for windows? I try on my @tools...
2011-10-23T07:23:12  <Belerafon_L> * ++
2011-10-23T07:23:18  <Belerafon_L> exe file
2011-10-23T07:23:24  <delt0r_> In fact i think GreenTea was one person who got burnt with the game turn limit change?

2011-10-23T07:24:41  <delt0r_> in lisp?
2011-10-23T07:24:44  <AlvinMinring_> delt0r_: Yep I see, but one could imagine making these basic values change dramatically to see how robust bots are. That would make creating a competent bot a whole lot more complicated though.
2011-10-23T07:24:52  <delt0r_> with declared types?
2011-10-23T07:24:58  * delt0r_ is surprised 
2011-10-23T07:25:04  <GreenTea> with no declared tipes
2011-10-23T07:25:13  <GreenTea> it is too complicated for me)

2011-10-23T07:25:48  <delt0r_> AlvinMinring_: yes. but its likely to be map based only.. ie turn limit for big maps and many players may be larger
2011-10-23T07:26:05  <GreenTea> i see some code with declared tipes, and cant understant it. it seem very low level..
2011-10-23T07:26:06  <delt0r_> i expect that view radius to be constant over all maps..
2011-10-23T07:26:14  <GreenTea> like assembler...
2011-10-23T07:26:18  <delt0r_> GreenTea: right... its not so hard
2011-10-23T07:26:22  <AlvinMinring_> delt0r_: yep, makes sense
2011-10-23T07:26:39  <delt0r_> is also "meta information" in that lisp does not need declared types
2011-10-23T07:27:05  <delt0r_> but then the JVM has had a *lot* of work put into it by some big players
2011-10-23T07:27:30  <GreenTea> delt0r_, do you know some good book or tutoralal about declared types in sbcl?
2011-10-23T07:27:44  <olexs> Java is fast enough if one knows his way around using proper data structures and algorithms correctly
2011-10-23T07:27:59  <delt0r_> GreenTea: not really. Sort of learnt what i know from doing.. but i have not had a chance to do much lisp
2011-10-23T07:28:14  <delt0r_> i just know that performance is not consider bad genrally
2011-10-23T07:28:24  <delt0r_> and 6x slower than java is bad
2011-10-23T07:28:46  <delt0r_> java is not slow... but its not SSE/MMX optimised C either
2011-10-23T07:29:37  <delt0r_> GreenTea: what i have done in the past is getting everything working. Then add declarations where needed after that.
2011-10-23T07:30:04  <delt0r_> olexs: true
2011-10-23T07:30:26  <delt0r_> true in general for most langs... you need to understand what works with your tool...
2011-10-23T07:31:00  <olexs> it's important to avoid O(n) and higher complexity stuff where possible, and not to overload GC with too many short-lived instances of objects
2011-10-23T07:31:01  <delt0r_> olexs: my day job is replacing a C app with a java one. My current java version is more than 7 times faster
2011-10-23T07:31:14  <delt0r_> that is not true anymore
2011-10-23T07:31:30  <delt0r_> short lived objects are cheap with generational GC
2011-10-23T07:32:10  <delt0r_> object pools typically are slower than not using them (in the case of pure java objects JDBC connection are a different story)
2011-10-23T07:32:33  <olexs> delt0r_: my testing proved different... maybe those were large objects, but in my battle simulation search tree, it is much cheaper to perform all simulation on a single node instance, then rolling back changes, than creating a new instance for every node and discarding the non-optimal paths later
2011-10-23T07:33:13  <delt0r_> well if you have profiled then sure... i belive you...
2011-10-23T07:33:27  <delt0r_> but be warned on some JVMs it could well be slower
2011-10-23T07:33:50  <delt0r_> also that is not really pooling
2011-10-23T07:33:57  <olexs> true... I'd actually need to test it on the same JVM the server uses. by the way, what is it? :)
2011-10-23T07:34:12  <delt0r_> pooling has a bad habit of polluting the cache
2011-10-23T07:34:21  <delt0r_> OpenJDK
2011-10-23T07:34:27  <olexs> ok, I can test that
2011-10-23T07:34:36  <delt0r_> will be different from jdk 7
2011-10-23T07:34:44  <delt0r_> more like a jdk 1.6.0
2011-10-23T07:34:47  <delt0r_> i guess
2011-10-23T07:34:54  <delt0r_> its is different that is for sure
2011-10-23T07:34:56  <olexs> I'm still on JDK 6, winx64 here
2011-10-23T07:35:16  <delt0r_> then i expect you are getting a pretty good indication of server side performance
2011-10-23T07:35:22  <delt0r_> but never hurts to test
2011-10-23T07:35:37  <GreenTea> unfortunately my bot works very close to time limit 1sec. therefore even small slowness is important for me. And i cant risk to rewrite all in lisp and then find out that i have timeouts everywhere...

2011-10-23T07:35:53  <olexs> well it was fairly consistent, and I could add 2 plies of base search depth after that optimization without having timeouts on theserver
2011-10-23T07:36:03  <delt0r_> GreenTea: yea.. what is your most experiance lang?
2011-10-23T07:36:18  <GreenTea> java
2011-10-23T07:36:22  <delt0r_> olexs: good to know
2011-10-23T07:36:39  <delt0r_> GreenTea: its why i use it a lot
2011-10-23T07:36:45  <delt0r_> i just know it well
2011-10-23T07:36:55  <GreenTea> )
2011-10-23T07:37:06  <delt0r_> so easier for me to write efficient code in it
2011-10-23T07:38:10  <delt0r_> GreenTea: are you doing big searches?
2011-10-23T07:38:36  <delt0r_> and is your timing dynamic? ie put it on faster hardware it will use it?
2011-10-23T07:39:24  <GreenTea> delt0r_, most time consuming is path finding and battle calculation
2011-10-23T07:39:48  <delt0r_> olexs: also in your case with your nodes these are not short lived objects... so replacing objects that get into the next generation is more like the old java gc model
2011-10-23T07:39:55  <delt0r_> GreenTea: Really?
2011-10-23T07:40:23  <GreenTea> if time is near over then bot can skip some calculation and make more simple moves
2011-10-23T07:40:24  <delt0r_> i guess the maps are quite big... but would think A* should handle it fine
2011-10-23T07:40:45  <GreenTea> so on better hardwere it should play stronger
2011-10-23T07:40:52  <delt0r_> right
2011-10-23T07:40:56  <olexs> GreenTea: by battle calculation you mean the resolution? that is pretty fast for me, by far not the slowest element
2011-10-23T07:42:22  <GreenTea> olexs, i try to find optimal solution in battle resolution
2011-10-23T07:42:27  <GreenTea> therefore it is slow
2011-10-23T07:42:48  <olexs> GreenTea: me too. the tree generation and simulation in total is slow, yes
2011-10-23T07:43:15  <olexs> but then, it's the main "brain" of the bot, so it's allowed to be :)
2011-10-23T07:43:46  <delt0r_> GreenTea: i though your bot was doing from watching a few games

2011-10-23T08:21:00  <awishformore> Alexer: what's the deal with the tcp server?
2011-10-23T08:21:08  <Alexer> for good measure, people might run bots simultaneously at http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto and http://ash.webfactional.com/howto
2011-10-23T08:21:42  <Alexer> awishformore, on the official servers you get like.. one game in X hours, right? on tcp servers you get one game in X minutes :P
2011-10-23T08:21:54  <awishformore> so basically testing then
2011-10-23T08:21:56  <Alexer> awishformore, since the load is on the user's computers, not on the server
2011-10-23T08:22:00  <Alexer> awishformore, yep
2011-10-23T08:22:06  <awishformore> ok
2011-10-23T08:22:18  <awishformore> expect my bot to join up in like a week ;)
2011-10-23T08:23:21  <Alexer> but people should leave their bots running so that there's always the critical mass of bots to play good games :P

2011-10-23T09:27:39  <cirno_the_greate> passable means not WATER and ants might have the ability to move there at some point, if not this turn.
2011-10-23T09:28:08  <boegel> cirno_the_greate: so, this definition is incomplete?
2011-10-23T09:28:38  <boegel> cirno_the_greate: I don't see how the current implementation doesn't match the description

2011-10-23T09:30:07  <cirno_the_greate> no, we need direction function
2011-10-23T09:30:17  <cirno_the_greate> Direction: Provide a function to determine the 1 or 2 orthogonal directions from one point to another on a torus.

2011-10-23T10:04:56  <joapuipe> ok
2011-10-23T10:04:58  <joapuipe> thanks
2011-10-23T10:05:13  <Fluxid> if yoy MyBot.py uses only module ants, then include ants.py

2011-10-23T10:06:16  <dabino> Saulzar: that's the problem: game specification is odd. According to it lower letter are bots, capitals are bots on hills. My starter package just recognize all capital Hs as hills... Obviously incorrect, but bots are fighting somehow.

2011-10-23T10:09:04  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=3579&user=757 i;m surprised how ants fails to raze sir_macelon's hill at (61,52) most the time
2011-10-23T10:09:48  <Fluxid> two enemy ants almost razed it but KILLED EACH OTHER right over the hill!
2011-10-23T10:10:34  <Fluxid> and turn before ant would raze it, suddenly ant spawns from it to immediately kill attacker
2011-10-23T10:10:37  <Fluxid> pure luck

2011-10-23T10:13:23  <cyphase> Fluxid, you have some control over spawning
2011-10-23T10:13:31  <cyphase> you could guard th food until you want to spawn :P

2011-10-23T10:32:11  <_flag> The game ends because "food is not being gathered" but really the map is just ridiculously long and they've been changed on the main server so this doesn't happen
2011-10-23T10:32:18  <ants9238483> anyone know a way to have your code to send debugging info back from the server? such as time per turn?

2011-10-23T11:34:12  <bmh> Can you raze your own hill?
2011-10-23T11:34:28  <cyphase> no
2011-10-23T11:34:42  <cyphase> but you can stand on your own hill to prevent spawning
2011-10-23T11:34:55  <cyphase> which you'd probably only want to do if you have more than one hill
2011-10-23T11:36:22  <vDevXY> anyone an idea how to beginn as a complete newbie in this area for a c++ bot? :p

2011-10-23T11:36:50  <vDevXY> i quite dont get the sense of this antsgame
2011-10-23T11:37:24  <vDevXY> thought the starter package is too bad and must be modified... but i dont know where to beginn
2011-10-23T11:37:45  <pedrosorio> vDevXY: the rules are not perfectly clear, but you should probably read them first
2011-10-23T11:37:48  <ants9238483> tbh, never liked the starter packages :P

2011-10-23T11:38:43  <pedrosorio> vDevXY: the next thing is go to the tutorial page and see how to test your bot in your computer http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial.php
2011-10-23T11:39:13  <vDevXY> thats the problem, i only know: there are ants, that spread through feed, they kill other ants, must take over hills, but no plan how i get the parameters to test my bot^^
2011-10-23T11:39:19  <vDevXY> thx @pedrosorio
2011-10-23T11:39:40  <pedrosorio> vDevXY: and then the readme of the starter package which gives a short description of what each source file is doing
2011-10-23T11:42:18  <vDevXY> what i also dont understand: we only have 1 second time per turn, dont we?
2011-10-23T11:42:19  <bmh> Is it cheating to infer the content of the map based on the requirement that maps are symmetric?

2011-10-23T11:47:46  <ikaros> if you don't have a lot of programming experience it would probably be better to take python or so
2011-10-23T11:47:51  <bmh> I wouldn't use C for this, but then again, I'm using Haskell.

2011-10-23T11:50:30  <ikaros> just take the language which you are best at :)
2011-10-23T11:50:41  <ikaros> best hint i can give
2011-10-23T11:50:59  <cyphase> you could always port to a different language later
2011-10-23T11:51:06  <vDevXY> yeah c++ shouldnt be a problem else python, but c++ should be better in speed, much better^^
2011-10-23T11:51:49  <ikaros> for example i'm prototyping with lua and will perhaps change to c++ or ocaml in the end.. not sure.. perhaps lua will be fine for the whole time
2011-10-23T11:51:49  <jmcarthur> vDevXY: when choosing a language for a project, the most important criteria to me is how fun it will be

2011-10-23T11:52:39  <ikaros> how about submitting zips for compiled languages.. do we have to put a makefile in the zip or how does the server compile stuff
2011-10-23T11:52:54  <ikaros> e.g. if i choose to use ocaml will the server have ocamlbuild?
2011-10-23T11:52:56  <jmcarthur> ikaros: it looks for a file called MyBot.extension

2011-10-23T11:53:10  <otzi> I thought on taking lisp and learning to program in it while doing the programming. But I backed up :(. I'm doing it in C++ now.
2011-10-23T11:53:19  <jmcarthur> ikaros: it doesn't really use build systems
2011-10-23T11:53:26  <ikaros> but there has linking to be done.. cant figure that out all alone
2011-10-23T11:54:02  <jmcarthur> ikaros: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py#L302
2011-10-23T11:54:19  <ikaros> nice thx i will look into that
2011-10-23T11:54:21  <vDevXY> can we use some extra libraries? like boost?
2011-10-23T11:54:43  <ikaros> that's what i was looking for: "OCaml"     : [["ocamlbuild -lib unix", BOT + ".native"]]
2011-10-23T11:54:46  <otzi> you can embed it into your source
2011-10-23T11:54:46  <ikaros> great :)
2011-10-23T11:54:53  <jmcarthur> vDevXY: anything the server doesn't have you have to include with your bot. large libraries might be problematic
2011-10-23T11:55:02  <otzi> use bcp for that so it copies only what you really need from boost
2011-10-23T11:55:30  <jmcarthur> i love seeing so much functional programming in this contest
2011-10-23T11:56:07  <ikaros> if i'd use c++ i would use headers libs only anyways

2011-10-23T12:54:48  <UncleVasya> amstan, hi. Is it hard to implement  statistic for a time taken by bot for his turns? I think it would be interesting to people to compare their bots in "place_in_the_ranking_table / average_turn_time"
2011-10-23T12:54:54  <Fandekasp> In my do_turn(), I'd like to put a breakpoint to study a bit more what's going on, what data are available etc (just finished the tuto). But when I put a ipdb, then run the bot, it gives a "bot 0 timed out". Is there a debug mode or something ?

2011-10-23T13:05:13  <bward> Any advice on stopping the bot timing out? I'm running the python tutorial bot and I've added BFS for pathfinding, but it times out quite quickly in any game I play, even if I double the turn time.
2011-10-23T13:06:03  <bmh> bward: A*?
2011-10-23T13:06:16  <UncleVasya> bward: try to check only visible locations
2011-10-23T13:07:02  <bward> UncleVasya, I've changed the exploring code so it BFSes outwards from all idle ants and goes to the first nonvisible square so I'm not checking everything
2011-10-23T13:07:15  <bward> bmh, is it much faster? I tried that but it didn't seem to make a huge difference
2011-10-23T13:07:25  <UncleVasya> try to finish turn right when all of your ants have been moved.

2011-10-23T13:09:57  <bward> UncleVasya, so you search from an unexplored square back to an ant?
2011-10-23T13:10:31  <UncleVasya> For exploration I make a boundary_list and then launch a search from it to ants.
2011-10-23T13:10:31  <UncleVasya> No, BFS is ok for me.

2011-10-23T13:45:25  <cyphase> or be able to spawn a queen that can spawn a new hill somewhere else
2011-10-23T13:45:26  <tncardoso> is there a way to get the error that killed my bot? (i am using test_bot but no error is printed)
2011-10-23T13:45:32  <otzi> I'm asking that because C++ starter package forgets about seen hills once it leaves sight. That's unecessary, then, since the hill will always be there.
2011-10-23T13:46:05  <bward> So I'm trying to get A* to search for the closest ant to food. How do I determine the h score if I don't actually know where the ant is going to be? Slightly confused by this ><
2011-10-23T13:50:19  <amstan> bward: you have to explore until you find an ant
2011-10-23T13:50:23  <ants9238483> tbh, i think bfs would be better
2011-10-23T13:50:51  <bward> amstan, so I can't use a heuristic function until I find an ant?

2011-10-23T13:51:07  <ants9238483> well, once you find an ant that isn't occupied
2011-10-23T13:51:13  <amstan> bward: well, put it this way, you can't do pathfinding if you don't have a destination yet
2011-10-23T13:51:13  <ants9238483> you're pretty much done
2011-10-23T13:51:21  <pedrosorio> bward: heuristic function of what? A* works when you have a known destination and source
2011-10-23T13:51:33  <Belerafon_L> There are real problem with @tools. I try to run my C++ program and found that script sandbox.py don't sent data to my bot in line "stdin.write". This is famous problem of python version >3 (or >3.1 don't know). After calling stdin.write and stdin.flush data have not transmited to my bot. Only after calling stdin.close() i receive all data what have been sended to me.
2011-10-23T13:51:58  <bward> pedrosorio, that's how I understood it. Someone further up said I could use it to search for the nearest ant to food - I can't see how though
2011-10-23T13:52:08  <bward> In a better way that BFS would, that is.

2011-10-23T14:57:11  <Axoren> keeping track of states on things that might stop existing is weird

2011-10-23T14:58:03  <Axoren> Anyone good with python?
2011-10-23T14:58:04  <Axoren> I've got a syntax question
2011-10-23T14:58:08  <amstan> Axoren: yep?
2011-10-23T14:58:38  <Migi32> I really would put it in the FAQ or the contest rules or something. For my screen's resolution, it looks like the homepage ends with the battle animation thing
2011-10-23T14:59:41  <Puj> Pythoners, any idea how I could go about intercepting the KILL signal from engine.py and print a stacktrace from my bot when handled?
2011-10-23T15:00:07  <jbroman> SIGKILL cannot be caught.
2011-10-23T15:00:11  <Puj> Mums
2011-10-23T15:00:17  <Puj> I guess that's the idea..
2011-10-23T15:00:20  <Dominater> amstan: You should put on the submission page that zipping or taring files on a Mac doesn't work
2011-10-23T15:00:37  <amstan> Dominater: why not? it seems like it could be fixed
2011-10-23T15:00:46  <jbroman> SIGTERM is the polite "please clean up first" version, but SIGKILL causes the OS to immediately stop execution.
2011-10-23T15:01:19  <Dominater> I couln't do it last night, It kept giving me that "MyBot.*" wasn't found, tried .zip and .tar.gz
2011-10-23T15:01:30  <Dominater> zipped the same files on my Acer and it had no problem
2011-10-23T15:01:58  <UncleVasya> amstan: Is there some average server's speed  you'll try to keep?
2011-10-23T15:02:20  <amstan> UncleVasya: no, it's all based on money
2011-10-23T15:02:22  <Puj> Okay, jbroman, so I can switch the signal issued to SIGTERM and then handle it in mybot?

2011-10-23T15:05:44  <amstan> then figure out how to execute it manually, probably something like java MyBot.class
2011-10-23T15:05:48  <Craklyn> Well, first I want to make MyBot into a .jar file, right?
2011-10-23T15:05:56  <Craklyn> MyBot.java -> MyBot.jar
2011-10-23T15:06:02  <Puj> jbroman, one more question if you will..  Is it possible to create a stacktrace of the code currently executing immediately before the SIGTERM is handled?
2011-10-23T15:06:10  <ants9238483> Craklyn: not really
2011-10-23T15:06:15  <amstan> Craklyn: you don't necessarly need the jar, you can use the class just fine

2011-10-23T15:12:57  <Craklyn> Okay, this is what my play_one_game file looks like:    python "%~dp0playgame.py" --engine_seed 42 --player_seed 42 --end_wait=0.25 --verbose --log_dir game_logs --turns 500 --map_file "%~dp0maps\maze\maze_04p_01.map" %* "python ""%~dp0sample_bots\python\GreedyBot.py""" "python ""%~dp0sample_bots\python\LeftyBot.py""" "python ""%~dp0sample_bots\python\HunterBot.py""" "java MyBot -classpath C:\Users\Daniel\workspace\simant\bin\\"

2011-10-23T15:30:56  <peregrinator> can anyone explain what the view radius numbers mean in ants? IE what does 55 represent?
2011-10-23T15:31:02  <UncleVasya> yohann: good luck!
2011-10-23T15:31:26  <UncleVasya> 55 is a squared radius (r^2)
2011-10-23T15:31:36  <a1k0n> peregrinator: (x1-x0)^2 + (y1-y0)^2 < viewradius2 (or is it <=?)
2011-10-23T15:31:55  <Craklyn> You can any square is a distance-squared (as the bird flies) less than veiwradius2
2011-10-23T15:32:05  <Craklyn> probably <= actually, yeah..

2011-10-23T15:40:03  <peregrinator> <a1k0n><Craklyn> so a viewradius2 of 55 seems to suggest items within 7 tiles are viewable. But the ants seem to not actually see more than 2 tiles. What am I misunderstanding?
2011-10-23T15:40:04  <McLeopold> Axoren: you can directly modify the ants class variables, ants.food_list.  Python has no sense of private variables
2011-10-23T15:40:26  <Puj> Sorry for the big paste, but McLeopold, can you see anything here which would disable MyBot stderr redirection to playgame.py stderr to terminal?

2011-10-23T15:40:49  <Puj> lol
2011-10-23T15:40:58  <Puj> I guess the visualizer has to redirect the stderr as well

When I run the step where I run "make",  I get the message "javac: Command not found".  I don't see any package called javac to install for cygwin.  Any suggestions?
2011-10-23T15:41:08  <Puj> Winning.
2011-10-23T15:41:31  <McLeopold> Craklyn: windows or linux?
2011-10-23T15:41:37  <Craklyn> cygwin, so linux on windows :P
2011-10-23T15:42:01  <McLeopold> check your path, you should be able to run javac by itself and get help
2011-10-23T15:42:02  <ants9238483> Craklyn: if you're running windows, you need to install jdk
2011-10-23T15:42:24  <Axoren> so it would be ants.food_list.remove(ants.food()[0])?
2011-10-23T15:42:25  <Craklyn> Ah, so if I install jdk, it'll be usable by cygwin?
2011-10-23T15:42:35  <Axoren> Right, McLeopold?
2011-10-23T15:42:36  <Craklyn> No worries if you're not sure :P
2011-10-23T15:42:43  <McLeopold> Craklyn: type "which javac" to see if it is installed and where
2011-10-23T15:43:12  <Craklyn> It's not installed yet
2011-10-23T15:43:27  <McLeopold> Axoren: yes, but I wouldn't do that.  I think it is better to maintain a list of food locations you have targetted, then check that list, rather than remove stuff from the state
2011-10-23T15:43:48  <Axoren> but that only affects the current turn, correct?
2011-10-23T15:44:08  <McLeopold> Axoren: also, you are removing the first item, so ants.food_list.pop() would look nicer
2011-10-23T15:44:14  <Axoren> alright
2011-10-23T15:44:23  <McLeopold> Axoren: yes, it will heal itself next turn
2011-10-23T15:44:39  <Axoren> alright
2011-10-23T15:44:40  <McLeopold> Axoren: you just open yourself up for bugs if you forget it is happening
2011-10-23T15:44:52  <Axoren> so for the moment, it'll suffice
2011-10-23T15:45:05  <Axoren> Ducktape all the things!
2011-10-23T15:45:15  <McLeopold> Axoren: actually, what is better is to get a list calling ants.food(), then remove from that temporary list
2011-10-23T15:45:18  <ants9238483> Craklyn: jdk should work with cygwin
2011-10-23T15:45:27  <ants9238483> Craklyn: but not 100% positive
2011-10-23T15:45:29  <McLeopold> food = ants.food()   food.pop()

2011-10-23T15:47:31  <peregrinator> I'm still a little confused about viewradius and ant vision: a viewradius2 of 55 seems to suggest items within 7 tiles are viewable. But the ants seem to not actually see more than 2 tiles. What am I misunderstanding?
2011-10-23T15:47:41  <Axoren> If I have a list of tuples, can I modify the contents of the tuples without removing them from the list and placing new tuples in the list?
2011-10-23T15:47:49  <Axoren> or do I have to remove then replace?
2011-10-23T15:48:21  <AndrewBC> Any administrators around that can help me out with a code uploading problem?

2011-10-23T16:53:28  <cyphase> rmmh, turns are computed in 5 phases: (in order) move, attack, raze, gather, spawn. normally you and an enemy cant be on the same space because someone would have been killed before you got that close. however, if in one turn an enemy moves to a space next to your hill and your hill spawns an ant, then on the next turn your ant moves onto that enemy's space, you'll be on the same space until the attack portion of the turn is completed

2011-10-23T17:46:14  <Axoren> If you want to make a sudoku solver, just make 27 sets of integers.
2011-10-23T17:46:26  <Axoren> One for each column, row, and 3x3 box
2011-10-23T17:46:35  <amstan> Craklyn: time limit was 20seconds, but somehow it guessed it before the time was up
2011-10-23T17:46:46  <Axoren> then, make each square in the 9x9 reference 3 of those sets
2011-10-23T17:46:59  <Axoren> the value of the 9x9 is the only number that can fit into all 3 sets

2011-10-23T18:50:43  <jmcarthur> it looks like those bots were very simplistic anyway. i doubt they were doing anything too heavy. they also all timed out at about the same time. i suspect that the server is to blame for those timeouts

2011-10-23T18:58:12  <paulwal> if there tons of identical bots it will just clog up the server and degrade the contest.  No one wants to see 90% of the top 100 bots be exact copies of eachother
2011-10-23T18:58:21  <AndrewBC> bmh, yeah basically what they said
2011-10-23T18:58:27  <AndrewBC> darn afkness distracted me

2011-10-23T18:58:40  <bmh> paulwal: They should hash the bots and kill dupes.
2011-10-23T18:58:50  <Epona> I write a lot of things in pygame

2011-10-23T18:59:22  <paulwal> they do or they should?  I agree they should. Of course some could just make a small change. And then there's all the duplicate starter bots
2011-10-23T18:59:35  <Epona> that uses multiple files, but isn't really as relevant
2011-10-23T18:59:42  <a1k0n> a depressing number of new games are of 8 bots all going straight up and then crashing into each other
2011-10-23T18:59:56  <AndrewBC> if a small change doesn't result in any hash change, then you've got a bad hash for these purposes
2011-10-23T19:00:20  <rmmh> hash the bosh outputs :)
2011-10-23T19:00:24  <rmmh> bot outputs
2011-10-23T19:00:32  <paulwal> ah yea
2011-10-23T19:00:34  <a1k0n> yeah, you could precompute the input of each bot
2011-10-23T19:00:43  <a1k0n> and then precompute a map existing solely of starter bots
2011-10-23T19:00:52  <a1k0n> er, a game output for each map
2011-10-23T19:01:02  <amstan> a1k0n: hey
2011-10-23T19:01:07  <a1k0n> then it would be no strain at all for people to upload starter bots
2011-10-23T19:01:08  <paulwal> there would still inevitably be duplicate bots with adjustable constants
2011-10-23T19:01:13  <Alexer> bmh, while i admit i had the same idea, it goes against the idea that it should be easy to test everything is working and start seeing results
2011-10-23T19:01:16  <a1k0n> amstan: sup

2011-10-23T19:01:21  <rmmh> a1k0n: starter bot deduplication, clever
2011-10-23T19:01:33  <Alexer> bmh, step 1: upload bot; step 2: site tells you "no can do, duplicate bot"
2011-10-23T19:02:04  <a1k0n> amstan: i am.  don't know how serious i'll be about it but i have some awesome ideas that are sure to be terrible once implemented
2011-10-23T19:02:10  <rmmh> Alexer: it would be nice if the site directed you to play on an official tcp server

2011-10-23T19:02:26  <antong> hi guys, anyone using java starter package?
2011-10-23T19:02:26  <Alexer> of course you could special-case it and show the matches from the identical bot, but in that case at some point something would break
2011-10-23T19:03:06  *** Katiska <Katiska!rysae@otitsun.oulu.fi> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-23T19:03:13  <Alexer> rmmh, yeah. i suggested creating an official tcp server to the organizers, but they're too busy currently with the normal server :P
2011-10-23T19:03:19  <rmmh> hehe
2011-10-23T19:03:23  <paulwal> how about to get into the top tier rankings, your code must differ by a certain percentage from all other bots in the top X ranks
2011-10-23T19:03:27  <AndrewBC> detecting file duplicates is a solved problem by SCM tools
2011-10-23T19:03:29  <rmmh> Fluxid: how much load is the tcp server?
2011-10-23T19:03:45  <AndrewBC> just do that for every file used in a bot, it'll be hashes
2011-10-23T19:03:55  <Alexer> rmmh, but the problem isn't really starter bots per se. i mean, if the starter bots weren't uploaded, there'd still be enough users to clog up the servers
2011-10-23T19:04:07  <AndrewBC> all match = duplicate, any mismatch = early bailout because not dupe
2011-10-23T19:04:14  <Alexer> rmmh, it just happened sooner because everyone submitted a starter bot before their real one
2011-10-23T19:04:30  <bmh> Alexer: yeah. The starter guide said "Submit the stock bot" oops :)
2011-10-23T19:04:34  <Fluxid> rmmh: 1.6% of CPU
2011-10-23T19:04:34  <rmmh> yeah maybe the 5-minute quickstart shouldn't be "download this package" then "upload this package"
2011-10-23T19:04:45  <rmmh> Fluxid: so no need to optimize, cool
2011-10-23T19:04:46  <Fluxid> rmmh: out of all 8 cores
2011-10-23T19:04:55  <paulwal> AndrewBC, but there could and would be dupes that simply change a constant or add a comment to avoid creating a duplicate hash
2011-10-23T19:05:10  <AndrewBC> paulwal: those result in hash changes

2011-10-23T19:05:23  <AndrewBC> otherwise git wouldn't know anything when I change a constant or add a comment
2011-10-23T19:05:26  <AndrewBC> :P
2011-10-23T19:05:38  <AndrewBC> since it does, the hash must have changed
2011-10-23T19:05:48  <AndrewBC> it might even use two different hashing algorithms, I forget
2011-10-23T19:06:03  <paulwal> AndrewBC, right...so they wouldn't be seen as duplicates, right?
2011-10-23T19:06:14  <Alexer> bmh, it's easy to perceive that as the problem, but it isn't a problem. the perceived problem results from the fact that most haven't updated their first starter-bot-submission to a real bot yet
2011-10-23T19:06:37  <bmh> Alexer: I can only write code so fast :)
2011-10-23T19:06:41  <AndrewBC> paulwal: oh I see what you're saying
2011-10-23T19:06:56  <AndrewBC> you'd want to detect users who are intentionally trying to bypass the restriction
2011-10-23T19:06:58  <paulwal> AndrewBC, i'm saying it would still suck if there were hundreds of almost duplicate bots with just a simple change of some constants
2011-10-23T19:07:11  <antong> hi anyone had problems with java starter package ?
2011-10-23T19:07:11  <Alexer> bmh, and i'm saying it isn't a problem :) people just perceive it as a problem
2011-10-23T19:07:18  <Craklyn> Depends how many people upload unedited bots...
2011-10-23T19:07:27  <AndrewBC> I guess flag bots with extremely similar file structure
2011-10-23T19:07:30  <Craklyn> Antong:  What's the problem?  Mine mostly works, and I use java
2011-10-23T19:07:36  <Epona> I suppose I should upload an unedited one
2011-10-23T19:08:05  <AndrewBC> oh well, I don't think it's a problem
2011-10-23T19:08:17  <paulwal> yea
2011-10-23T19:08:20  <antong> Craklyn: when I do, java -jar MyBot.jar it says could not find the main class
2011-10-23T19:08:20  <Alexer> the starter bots are a problem only if a big percentage of the users are only going to upload a starter bot and then leave it at that
2011-10-23T19:08:22  <AndrewBC> if it becomes one, they can always just pore over the submission source
2011-10-23T19:08:28  <AndrewBC> and disqualify if need be
2011-10-23T19:08:36  <Craklyn> Antong:  Haha, I had that problem too
2011-10-23T19:08:44  <antong> Craklyn: but if i just do: java MyBot it works
2011-10-23T19:08:48  <rmmh> the quickstart literally tells you to just submit a starter package, so it shouldn't be hard to just use hashes of the archives
2011-10-23T19:08:56  <Craklyn> I spent about 6 hours today dealing with it and othe rproblems.  What are you running your java in? Windows command line, cygwin, linux?
2011-10-23T19:09:15  <antong> Craklyn: it's ubuntu
2011-10-23T19:09:23  <AndrewBC> Alexer: the matchmaking doesn't matchmake inactive bots
2011-10-23T19:09:27  <antong> runing from command line
2011-10-23T19:09:38  <cyphase> that could probably save a lot of time
2011-10-23T19:09:41  <Craklyn> I never could get it to work in cygwin (linux).  When I run jara -jar MyBot.jar in windows command line it works.

2011-10-23T20:35:47  <cyphase> that is a naive method for hill defense. leave an ant on the hill to prevent spawning. then when someone sends ants to attack, you keep respawning an ant as they get destroyed

2011-10-23T20:36:44  <murilo> I have to map a position to a ant number
2011-10-23T20:36:49  <cyphase> knapsack algorithm :P
2011-10-23T20:36:57  <a1k0n> i think if you can define "equal distribution of ants" you can find such an algorithm
2011-10-23T20:37:44  <anty_m> could use flocking/swarming algorithms to keep a certain distance, etc.
2011-10-23T20:37:51  <awishformore> Fluxid: i though the seed passed to you on setup is your own player id?
2011-10-23T20:38:07  <a1k0n> awishformore: no, that's arbitrary afaik
2011-10-23T20:38:24  <awishformore> so why would you even need the seed?
2011-10-23T20:38:36  <a1k0n> to make your random bot deterministic when testing
2011-10-23T20:38:41  <Fluxid> a1k0n: i want to keep as much of map visible as possible. to do that i want distances between ants to be roughly equal...
2011-10-23T20:39:05  <awishformore> so your own ants always get id 0?
2011-10-23T20:39:12  <a1k0n> Fluxid: so i'd start with a greedy algorithm to maximize the number of seen squares
2011-10-23T20:39:15  <a1k0n> awishformore: yep
2011-10-23T20:39:22  <a1k0n> (i am working on that very thing right now)

2011-10-23T20:40:06  <a1k0n> but hmm, i guess the euclidean distance between ants is equivalent
2011-10-23T20:40:32  <Fluxid> a1k0n: maybe i'll do the same algorithm i use to do map discovery... to make ants move where is something invisible

2011-10-23T20:45:58  <Fluxid> i think it is maximum distance from hill ants can spawn
2011-10-23T20:46:26  <jmcarthur> tester: spawnradius2 is the square of the distance that an ant must be from food in order to eat it
2011-10-23T20:46:35  <jmcarthur> the name is wrong for historical reasons :\
2011-10-23T20:46:36  <a1k0n> swinejihad: it's a start.  i treat my ants independently currently except for doing dependency resolution when they want to move on top of each other
2011-10-23T20:46:49  <jmcarthur> Fluxid: ^^
2011-10-23T20:47:12  <Fluxid> jmcarthur: ah!
2011-10-23T20:47:30  <tester> Thanks for all the replies! Are the values for viewradius and attackradius guaranteed to be constant over time?
2011-10-23T20:47:38  <Fluxid> yes
2011-10-23T20:47:40  <jmcarthur> the name comes from a time when there were no hills and food simply turned into an ant when you were in range

2011-10-23T20:48:33  <swinejihad> I mean it in the sense of say maybe wrapping an "ant" in an object, so I could say give one ant tile an objective to go somewhere over many turns
2011-10-23T20:49:03  <awishformore> does anyone use D* instead of A* with moving ants as dynamic obstacles?
2011-10-23T20:49:08  <tester> Has anyone seen a range of values for viewradius and attackradius? Is viewradius always greaterthan attackradius? By how much? What are the current values?
2011-10-23T20:49:46  <a1k0n> i think some people are doing that.  i'm not.
2011-10-23T20:49:58  <jmcarthur> swinejihad: i think that many OO styles are bad for performance, but not necessarily bad design aside from that
2011-10-23T20:50:13  <a1k0n> i always replan from scratch every frame.  shrug.

2011-10-23T20:50:18  <jmcarthur> swinejihad: you might have a hard time maintaining that abstraction though, since you would have to reidentify your ants on each turn
2011-10-23T20:50:39  <swinejihad> I decided against it because of the complexity of trying to figure out where the ant is/whether it got killed every turn
2011-10-23T20:50:42  <awishformore> jmcarthur: that's not all too hard
2011-10-23T20:50:46  <swinejihad> jmcarthur: exactly my thoughts
2011-10-23T20:50:57  <jmcarthur> awishformore: it might be too hard if you have to ask
2011-10-23T20:52:31  <anty_m> wooo, only 3 hours out of 5.5 remaining until my bot's first server game.
2011-10-23T20:52:55  <a1k0n> the servers are running slow again.  maybe some good games coming up.
2011-10-23T20:53:16  <awishformore> still so much work left on my bot
2011-10-23T20:53:19  <awishformore> can't wait to put it on ;)
2011-10-23T20:53:43  <a1k0n> a 10-player map going to 1000 turns with 1 second per turn each... could take almost 3 hours to run the game
2011-10-23T20:54:11  <Zannick> if they weren't well parallelized
2011-10-23T20:54:22  <a1k0n> does it run turns in parallel?
2011-10-23T20:54:29  <a1k0n> are these multi-cpu instances?
2011-10-23T20:54:36  <Zannick> 2 core, i think
2011-10-23T20:54:38  <jmcarthur> i think it tries to run one bot per core at a time
2011-10-23T20:54:43  <a1k0n> oh ok
2011-10-23T20:54:48  <awishformore> i would guess that most bots usually respond way faster than 1 second though
2011-10-23T20:54:54  <Zannick> i guess that cuts it down to 1.5 hrs ;)
2011-10-23T20:55:09  <Zannick> you usually want to respond quicker
2011-10-23T20:55:30  <a1k0n> if people start doing alpha-beta searches on battle clusters, though, it could get slow
2011-10-23T20:55:38  <a1k0n> and tremendously interesting to watch

2011-10-23T21:03:20  <a1k0n> my bot does a few BFS's and that's it.  takes 20ms/frame on a big map for any number of ants.  it's a stupid bot, though.

2011-10-23T21:04:53  <cyphase> jmcarthur, not sure, i haven't gotten to that yet, but presumably pathfinding. i was just wondering what your critique was
2011-10-23T21:05:34  <a1k0n> you can't do A* until you have a source and destination.  you can instead compute global information on the map in one pass, like distance to the nearest food for instance
2011-10-23T21:05:35  <jmcarthur> cyphase: A* works very well when you have clear goals, but it's not very often in this game that your goals are so clear.

2011-10-23T21:07:42  <swinejihad> an intelligent algorithm (a* or breadth-first) is still useful for short term path-finding

2011-10-23T21:13:33  <a1k0n> Alexer: sure.  start with all the food on the map, add the locations to list1.  dist=0.  foreach item in list1 { mark distance=dist.  add all neighbors that haven't been visited already to list2} list1=list2; clear list2;  repeat until list1 is empty.
2011-10-23T21:13:36  <swinejihad__> just go through the tutorial on the website
2011-10-23T21:13:46  <Moduspwned> I want to see how my new bot does, but it has been 5 hours since I submitted it and still not games.
2011-10-23T21:13:57  <Islacrusez> the tutorial has been helpful up to the point where I actually downloaded the files
2011-10-23T21:13:59  <a1k0n> Alexer: visits each square on the map once.  it's basically unit-cost dijkstra.
2011-10-23T21:14:00  <Moduspwned> The rest of you need to have your bots take less time ;-)
2011-10-23T21:14:06  <a1k0n> or.. breadth-first-search.
2011-10-23T21:14:46  <Alexer> a1k0n, ah, we just had different definitions for "one pass" :P
2011-10-23T21:15:20  <a1k0n> Alexer: well, heh.  it's O(N) for N squares on the map.
2011-10-23T21:15:32  <Alexer> a1k0n, though i do it by bfs:ing from each food to nearest ant one food at a time
2011-10-23T21:15:33  <Islacrusez> I tried calling my bot in play_one_game.sh and it always returns as crashed
2011-10-23T21:15:34  <a1k0n> but yeah, not like top to bottom
2011-10-23T21:16:05  <a1k0n> Alexer: it's probably a good idea if you're allocating ants to food, cuz otherwise you have to redo it to keep all your ants from going to the same food
2011-10-23T21:16:07  <Alexer> a1k0n, it shouldn't be that much slower, since usually you eat food quite fast and nearest ant is always inside viewradius

2011-10-23T21:36:09  <Moduspwned> Oh..... maybe I should have an ant playing defense
2011-10-23T21:36:40  <a1k0n> my thinking was the best defense is a good offence
2011-10-23T21:36:42  <Moduspwned> Brilliant, ok one ant will always play D, so it will take 2 ants for me to lose
2011-10-23T21:36:45  <a1k0n> turns out to not actually work
2011-10-23T21:36:57  <Moduspwned> ya, I found all the games I lost my hill was to a single ant
2011-10-23T21:36:59  <Moduspwned> should be easy to fix
2011-10-23T21:37:31  <a1k0n> my last game was embarassing that way: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=5139&user=432
2011-10-23T21:37:43  <a1k0n> orange is wiped out, but he has three ants wandering around the map who eventually catch me with my pants down
2011-10-23T21:38:50  <a1k0n> also my ants mostly killed each other
2011-10-23T21:39:12  <Moduspwned> sometimes my bot seems to do nothing on the tcp, like just first ant doesnt move. I lagged out of the game or something?
2011-10-23T21:39:56  <a1k0n> odd, not sure

2011-10-23T21:49:13  <a1k0n> i do?
2011-10-23T21:49:23  <a1k0n> my bot is utterly unaware of enemy ants
2011-10-23T21:49:47  <a1k0n> what it has is an emergent property of the stupid way it goes about collecting food and/or exploring
2011-10-23T21:50:24  <analyst74> ya, your ants are like the vikings "we don't collect food, we just burn villages!"
2011-10-23T21:50:25  <Islacrusez> ok, the sample bot always crashes on me, any ideas?
2011-10-23T21:50:37  <a1k0n> oh yeah, they like smashing anthills too
2011-10-23T21:50:47  <a1k0n> but they ignore enemy combatants in the process
2011-10-23T21:51:27  <analyst74> interesting group behaviour though

2011-10-23T21:52:28  <a1k0n> yeah i'm about to throw my bot away for the most part

2011-10-23T21:53:41  <Islacrusez> end result reads "crashed"
2011-10-23T21:53:52  <Moduspwned> I turned off my code that dealt with other ants for now. I couldn't get it to work right yet.

2011-10-23T21:54:43  <Moduspwned> My favorite thing I have right now is that each ant litterally does no thinking, It only looks at the 4 sqaures next to it. I wish this was score weighted by how many cpu cycles you used.
2011-10-23T21:55:19  <Islacrusez> surely that defeats the object of artificial "intelligence"?

2011-10-23T21:57:10  <murilo> this means that *my* next game starts within 238.4 minutes?

2011-10-23T21:58:31  <Islacrusez> via terminal, modified one of the play_one scripts
2011-10-23T21:58:51  <analyst74> have you tried to run it without modification?
2011-10-23T22:00:21  <Islacrusez> the script will run fine, can even pick one of the other sample_bots, but the starter bot crashes if I try to run that
2011-10-23T22:00:28  <Islacrusez> made no modifications to the starter bot
2011-10-23T22:00:37  <Craklyn> I have no idea how to begin making my ants handle combat...  Looking ahead with a Min/Max algorithm is obviously impossibly time consuming.  Any obvious approaches that I don't know about? :P
2011-10-23T22:00:42  <Guest76893> Same problem with the Coffee-script starter bot

2011-10-23T22:01:57  <antimatroid> we came up with rules for it but decided it was too hard to watch and complicated for an actual contest
2011-10-23T22:02:27  <antimatroid> well, we have rules for 2 player, more players is more complicated because you can have a "draw" from birthing a location

2011-10-23T22:05:01  <burny> did I miss any of these contests since last year?
2011-10-23T22:05:15  <Moduspwned> burny: only been the tron then the planets
2011-10-23T22:05:18  <burny> I randomly decided to look a couple days ago, and seems like I barly cought the start of this one
2011-10-23T22:05:28  <a1k0n> yeah, it started two days ago
2011-10-23T22:05:38  <antimatroid> i'm still not really sure how to do combat, one idea is to work out the maximum number of enemies that could possibly be within the battle radius of each location at the end of the turn
2011-10-23T22:05:38  <analyst74> a1k0n, ya, skyramp is raping my ants on tcp server :(
2011-10-23T22:05:41  <Moduspwned> burny: It just started, but some people had acess to it early as a beta, I think they are the one dominating right now
2011-10-23T22:06:00  <cyphase> yea
2011-10-23T22:06:03  <antimatroid> then try and move my ants as close as possible to enemies while they wont die
2011-10-23T22:06:05  <a1k0n> i'm withdrawing my crappy bot until i get some defense
2011-10-23T22:06:20  <Moduspwned> defense, or offense
2011-10-23T22:06:30  <antimatroid> a1k0n: what do you think about markov chains for tracking down runaway enmy ants?
2011-10-23T22:06:36  <a1k0n> first priority is not getting razed by errant wandering ants
2011-10-23T22:06:36  <Moduspwned> I think I am just going to teach mine to be cowards
2011-10-23T22:06:37  <antimatroid> i'm really keen to try that out
2011-10-23T22:07:02  * Islacrusez goes off to fetch a cup of tea since he can't even get a starter bot to run unmodified
2011-10-23T22:07:03  <a1k0n> antimatroid: like a probability envelope where the bot could be?
2011-10-23T22:07:15  <a1k0n> i've been thinking along those lines
2011-10-23T22:07:16  <mleise> I think you can rank fairly high by not losing any hill instead of razing others :)
2011-10-23T22:07:25  <Alexer> a1k0n, from the tcp servers? please don't. if people take their bots offline, other people have nothing to play against :( defeats the purpose
2011-10-23T22:07:37  <Alexer> just leave it running, pretty please? ;)
2011-10-23T22:07:40  <a1k0n> sigh, ok
2011-10-23T22:07:41  <antimatroid> yeah, if you see an ant the probability of an enemy being there is 1, then when enemies go out of range just assume they travel in each possible direction with equal probability and work out the transition probabilities
2011-10-23T22:08:03  <a1k0n> yeah, except for the part you can see so it's a little skewed
2011-10-23T22:08:16  <antimatroid> then if you have ants to spare and you could rank the locations by the probability of an ant being there and go to those places, or weight them based on path length as well

2011-10-23T22:08:37  <a1k0n> you can also try to divine their epicenter and hence their hill

2011-10-23T22:15:23  <a1k0n> yeah you pretty much have to try matching up the water with various candidate symmetries
2011-10-23T22:15:24  <burny> ah, I'm not aware of what info's you're given, besides site info
2011-10-23T22:15:36  <antimatroid> you aren't told the number of players
2011-10-23T22:15:47  <burny> map size?
2011-10-23T22:15:51  <antimatroid> yes
2011-10-23T22:15:59  <antimatroid> that gives you some information about the number of players
2011-10-23T22:16:03  <burny> ya
2011-10-23T22:16:08  <a1k0n> er?  aren't you told the number of players?
2011-10-23T22:16:11  <antimatroid> if we used lcm(players we're going to use) then it's not
2011-10-23T22:16:15  <a1k0n> is that only at the end of the game?
2011-10-23T22:16:17  <antimatroid> a1k0n: nope :)
2011-10-23T22:16:19  <antimatroid> yep
2011-10-23T22:16:20  <a1k0n> doohhh
2011-10-23T22:16:29  <Islacrusez> I think I give up =[
2011-10-23T22:16:35  <a1k0n> well, it's still possible
2011-10-23T22:16:38  <antimatroid> Islacrusez: don't say that, what's not working?
2011-10-23T22:16:53  <a1k0n> but my bot is not in a state to take advantage of that yet so it's an interesting subproblem for future exploration
2011-10-23T22:17:01  <antimatroid> a1k0n: the dimensions give you no info on the number of players if they're divisible by every possible number of players
2011-10-23T22:17:06  <a1k0n> antimatroid: i noticed that
2011-10-23T22:17:13  <Islacrusez> starter bot crashes

2011-10-23T22:19:11  <Alexer> Islacrusez, you've done something to the ants.py i think
2011-10-23T22:19:20  <Alexer> Islacrusez, Ants should have the run method..
2011-10-23T22:19:22  <burny> this game is a lot more interesting than planets was
2011-10-23T22:19:26  <lrh9> It's easy to fix though. Just change the variable ants.loc to something. (I forget what.)
2011-10-23T22:19:34  <antimatroid> burny: in which ways?
2011-10-23T22:19:44  <burny> in complexity, for ai
2011-10-23T22:19:47  <antimatroid> i think planet wars offered a really awesome problem, but ants has way more depth wrt ai ideas to run with
2011-10-23T22:20:01  <burny> last game, was nearly trivial to get first palce
2011-10-23T22:20:08  <antimatroid> haha
2011-10-23T22:20:25  <antimatroid> just cause you made the top 100 in a week doesn't mean bocsimaco's effort was trivial :P
2011-10-23T22:20:37  <a1k0n> shit, i was #1 for the first couple days of planetwars
2011-10-23T22:20:45  <antimatroid> yeah but you won tron :P
2011-10-23T22:20:45  <a1k0n> ended up, like, >#200
2011-10-23T22:20:52  <burny> the trivial solution I was stating, a coupel days after I started.. is what bocs said his solution was
2011-10-23T22:21:25  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i meant they started a week before the end of the contest and finished top 100
2011-10-23T22:21:49  <antimatroid> burny: implementation was still hard, it was by no means trivial imo
2011-10-23T22:22:02  <Islacrusez> crap, now I've really buggered the files
2011-10-23T22:22:07  <Alexer> Islacrusez, if you download a fresh python starter package you'll see that the Ants class in ants.py has a run method (and i just checked that to make sure there isn't some new bug)
2011-10-23T22:22:09  <Islacrusez> time to redownload
2011-10-23T22:22:11  <burny> yes, implementation wasn't trivial

2011-10-23T22:25:30  <burny> ya, it will be..
2011-10-23T22:25:38  <burny> is a lot of actions to consider
2011-10-23T22:25:51  <antimatroid> my multi source and multi target a* food collection could take up to 300ms or so during beta
2011-10-23T22:26:02  <antimatroid> but i can always tell it to stop collecting after xms
2011-10-23T22:26:14  <stano> damned timeouts, forcing me to redesign and optimize my code... I've been at it all day
2011-10-23T22:26:29  <analyst74> ants is more tolerating though, if you time out one game, you don't even necesarrily lose that one

2011-10-23T22:28:54  <antimatroid> Guest42467: it's easier to add the target to a queue and mark the location as added, then while the source is not found take the front location off the queue and for each of its neighbours, if it's the source you've found a path (move the source into the location you just took off the queue) otherwise if the location has not been added to the queue add it and mark it as added

2011-10-23T22:42:41  <burny> rules for this, are code must be 100% your own?
2011-10-23T22:42:52  <antimatroid> i'm also a complete noob with github
2011-10-23T22:42:55  <cyphase> antimatroid, do you have do_turn_26()?
2011-10-23T22:42:59  <antimatroid> i can pull, add, commit and push :P
2011-10-23T22:43:11  <antimatroid> and if something goes wrong i cry at amstan
2011-10-23T22:43:30  <burny> I'm a compelte tool with vcs systems.. I've successfully broken 4 different types of it
2011-10-23T22:43:43  <antimatroid> cyphase: what?
2011-10-23T22:43:46  <burny> broken = have to take a trip to teh bank, to get backup tapes
2011-10-23T22:43:57  <antimatroid> haha
2011-10-23T22:44:07  <cyphase> antimatroid, you said your vcs is copy-paste. i know i've done that before, rename old versions of functions as function_1() or whatever
2011-10-23T22:44:09  <Islacrusez> I can break any code, crash or corrupt any device
2011-10-23T22:44:31  <antimatroid> i usually just named them as i got further into developing components of my bot
2011-10-23T22:44:40  <antimatroid> like tree/decision/heuristic bot etc.
2011-10-23T22:44:56  <antimatroid> that's like the reverse order of development :P

2011-10-23T22:48:27  <Guest42467> Is HunterBot better than the Starting Kit?
2011-10-23T22:48:54  <burny> it performs better, but might lead you down a wrong road
2011-10-23T22:48:57  <antimatroid> analyst74: bear in mind they've all been working on their bot since during beta
2011-10-23T22:49:18  <cyphase> Guest42467, HunterBot is better than the starter kit after going through the tutorial
2011-10-23T22:49:24  <antimatroid> although ant hills were only added a couple of weeks ago
2011-10-23T22:49:26  <cyphase> on some maps at least
2011-10-23T22:49:47  <burny> if ant hills are the sole purpose, how were the only recently added?
2011-10-23T22:49:48  <cyphase> antimatroid, how were ants spawned before hills? at the site of the food?
2011-10-23T22:49:49  <antimatroid> re added if you count my early prototype game :P
2011-10-23T22:50:11  <antimatroid> used to just spawn where the food was, aim was to take out the other colonies
2011-10-23T22:50:20  <antimatroid> and you scored points for spawninng ants and killing enemies
2011-10-23T22:50:29  <antimatroid> it's way simpler to understand now and has a better objective imo
2011-10-23T22:50:53  <antimatroid> i like to think of it being like future cop lapd precinct assault
2011-10-23T22:50:53  <burny> agree
2011-10-23T22:51:15  <antimatroid> defend your base and invade the enemies bases
2011-10-23T22:51:15  <f4hy> ya sounds better, but I think you should gain the hill you take rather than raze it, but for games ending in due time razing is better
2011-10-23T22:51:32  <antimatroid> that would be cool but makes games last longer possibly
2011-10-23T22:51:34  <Guest42467> Its okay for me to upload the hunterbot to my account, right?
2011-10-23T22:51:38  <antimatroid> and doesn't really lead to a natural conclusion
2011-10-23T22:51:50  <antimatroid> it's be a lot more like planet wars if that was the case too, especially if we added in neutral hills
2011-10-23T22:51:59  <antimatroid> Guest42467: sure, but why? :P
2011-10-23T22:52:21  <Guest42467> Well, currently I have the base starting kit uploaded, so at least it'll be an improvement

2011-10-23T22:57:45  <antimatroid> yes
2011-10-23T22:57:59  <antimatroid> more map generators will be made
2011-10-23T22:58:20  <antimatroid> we need to work out a maximum dimensions at some point
2011-10-23T22:58:28  <antimatroid> and actually use maps up to those dimensions in the final

2011-10-23T22:59:19  <burny> so, for sure won't change for things like..
2011-10-23T22:59:23  <antimatroid> vague but unambiguous
2011-10-23T22:59:30  <Islacrusez> the map is made of hypercubes?
2011-10-23T22:59:31  <burny> all hills generate upon a food gather
2011-10-23T22:59:39  <AndrewBC> you could display the ants on a cube without making the physics 3d
2011-10-23T22:59:53  <cyphase> lol, physics
2011-10-23T22:59:58  <antimatroid> the game is currently being played on the surface of a discrete torus, what more do you want?
2011-10-23T22:59:59  <burny> or, after gathering a food, the ant must go back to a hill, to spawn a new ant
2011-10-23T23:00:01  <AndrewBC> it does change the wraparound a bit I guess
2011-10-23T23:00:05  <janzert> antimatroid: maps with a max dimension of 150 are already in use
2011-10-23T23:00:22  <antimatroid> janzert: my point is we need to set a maximum and use maps up to that maximum at the end
2011-10-23T23:00:26  <janzert> I also think that is hitting the limit of what can be visualized well
2011-10-23T23:01:11  <antimatroid> exactly, i think we need to work out a feasible limit that people should expect their bots to run on, but then it sucks if we use only a subset of those rules in the final and people who made assumptions get an advantage
2011-10-23T23:01:53  <janzert> just putting my vote in for 150 :)
2011-10-23T23:02:02  <AndrewBC> Hey janzert, did you see my pull request perchance?
2011-10-23T23:02:46  <burny> all hills, always have a path of atleast width 1, to all other hills?

2011-10-23T23:03:25  <antimatroid> otherwise blocking is possible
2011-10-23T23:03:37  <burny> the "what is near me" visibility stuff, will always allow you to see through ants/water/etc.?

2011-10-23T23:09:02  <lrh9> Islacrusez, your game gets a number to seed the random generator so that games can play out the same way over multiple runs. Useful for debugging purposes. You may fail to seed the generator, seed it differently, or use a generator that does not rely on a seed.
2011-10-23T23:09:08  <janzert> Islacrusez: unfortunately I think the tutorial was made with viewradius2=55, you might want to try setting that at the command line of playgame.py with --viewradius2 55
2011-10-23T23:09:31  <janzert> the default now is 77

2011-10-23T23:35:19  <AndrewBC> I'm number dyslexic
2011-10-23T23:35:28  <lrh9> I do love Python. I tried C++ years ago, but I never good get into it. I have nothing against C++. In fact I want to really learn it. But I think the technical complexity distracted me from what I believe to be the important foundations of programming: design, design, and more design.
2011-10-23T23:35:37  <AndrewBC> the site's go is 9753, I accidentally checked out 9573 and compiled that

2011-10-23T23:38:27  <lrh9> I don't really use modeling tools, but as I understand it they are supposed to help. E.g. UML. I don't know how effective they are though.
2011-10-23T23:38:55  <burny> uml is only part of the design
2011-10-23T23:39:30  <burny> and, because uml isn't integrated with the implementation.. means you can't design and dev simultaneously
2011-10-23T23:39:58  <AndrewBC> meh, UML is too much
2011-10-23T23:40:07  <burny> uml is too little by my books
2011-10-23T23:40:25  <AndrewBC> the problem is obvious from its very first initial

2011-10-23T23:41:48  <teryret> so the posted rules say "no threading", does that mean no go routines either?
2011-10-23T23:41:53  <AndrewBC> I appreciate what the creators are trying to do, but when someone has to explain to someone what a symbol in the model means because they've never seen it before because it's too broad a modeling language, then you haven't really saved any effort by putting it in the model than just explaining with a label and a circle anyway
2011-10-23T23:42:04  <AndrewBC> plus, the books they write are as boring as fuck
2011-10-23T23:42:16  <AndrewBC> teryret: no goroutines are fine
2011-10-23T23:42:24  <AndrewBC> they're just multiplexed on top of 1 thread
2011-10-23T23:42:29  <teryret> excellent, thanks!
2011-10-23T23:42:32  <AndrewBC> so you still get concurrency, but no parallelism
2011-10-23T23:42:41  <AndrewBC> yarr
2011-10-23T23:42:45  <lrh9> My design process consists of thinking about the problem really hard and writing/rewriting implementations until I get one I'm satisfied with. :)
2011-10-23T23:42:49  <teryret> but more importantly, I finally get an excuse to go learn go
2011-10-23T23:42:50  <AndrewBC> from my debug output: 2011/10/24 03:26:40 GOMAXPROCS: %!s(int=1)
2011-10-23T23:42:50  <AndrewBC> 2011/10/24 03:26:40 Go Version: release.r60.1 9753+
2011-10-23T23:43:19  <AndrewBC> I haven't yet felt brave enough to attempt setting that to a higher number ;x
2011-10-23T23:43:38  <teryret> I'm afraid I don't know go well enough to appreciate what you're showing me
2011-10-23T23:44:08  <AndrewBC> lol, that's the runtime value that determines the number of processors (virtual or otherwise) that can be used by the scheduler
2011-10-23T23:44:09  <burny> the advantage to the uml that has to be explained.. is you only have to explain it once
2011-10-23T23:44:17  <AndrewBC> burny: nonsense :P
2011-10-23T23:44:49  <teryret> yeah, I don't have the context, but I do know that I have to go re-learn UML every time I have to use it
2011-10-23T23:44:53  <AndrewBC> it's a language, it's likely that something that needs to be explained will need to be explained again before it's retained, just like any other language
2011-10-23T23:44:55  <burny> I want the design to be integrated with the implimentation though
2011-10-23T23:45:22  <teryret> why not do it reactively then, a tool that allows you to visualize what you've written?
2011-10-23T23:45:27  <lrh9> There are attempts to use UML for automatic code generation.
2011-10-23T23:45:44  <AndrewBC> ^ more "universal"

2011-10-23T23:45:50  <burny> eg. part of the design details things like.. what other data it is dependant on, if it is read-only, or if it modifies the data, if other instances of that class, can interact with the same isntances of some dependancy, etc.

2011-10-23T23:47:33  <Tommygun> How is everyone tonight?
2011-10-23T23:47:34  <burny> I ALMOST like c++
2011-10-23T23:47:36  <teryret> yeah, I'm not a super huge fan of c++ either
2011-10-23T23:47:44  <otzi> if you have a good idea about the software that will get produced by a tool, then you can create a very easy to use interface. Something that you don't even need to be a programmer to use.
2011-10-23T23:47:50  <burny> I slightly like c#
2011-10-23T23:47:58  <AndrewBC> language wars is not my thing though, I started with PHP so I don't berate people for their choices
2011-10-23T23:47:58  <teryret> ditto
2011-10-23T23:48:15  <teryret> I'd like C# a lot more if I didn't dislike the problems it is super good at solving
2011-10-23T23:48:24  <otzi> If you have a deep understanding of the generated code, all you can do is offer the programmer the possibility of doing it. But he'll need ot think by himself.
2011-10-23T23:49:21  <jmcarthur> i am a fan of simple, clear specifications. for that reason, i am not a fan of uml.
2011-10-23T23:49:29  <teryret> here here
2011-10-23T23:49:41  <jmcarthur> i'm half joking
2011-10-23T23:49:54  <AndrewBC> well, it's definitely a specification
2011-10-23T23:49:59  <cyphase> lol
2011-10-23T23:50:03  <lrh9> Agh. Bot has a bug.
2011-10-23T23:50:21  <otzi> I'm not fan of specifications, but I like easy to read, of course :P
2011-10-23T23:51:41  <burny> a complete design, is sufficient to allow a computer to do a complete implementation
2011-10-23T23:52:04  <jmcarthur> i think i should not have used such an overloaded word in my claim
2011-10-23T23:52:20  <otzi> the thing is that reading and writing specifications is a really boring task
2011-10-23T23:52:24  <burny> so currently nothing besides programming languages, allow you to do complete designs
2011-10-23T23:52:36  <otzi> but it's important for programmer interaction, of course
2011-10-23T23:52:38  <teryret> and we should keep it that way
2011-10-23T23:52:45  <AndrewBC> you can write programs to enforce specifications
2011-10-23T23:52:50  <lrh9> burny, WYSIWYG?
2011-10-23T23:53:17  <AndrewBC> what better way to encode a specification than into a rigid unforgiving program that must be used?
2011-10-23T23:53:35  <AndrewBC> if I lived in the world of Tron, I'd be a harsh dictator
2011-10-23T23:53:40  <burny> currently, I do all my design in c++
2011-10-23T23:53:48  <otzi> hehehe
2011-10-23T23:53:51  <burny> it's sort of annoying for huge projects
2011-10-23T23:54:05  <teryret> you joke burny, but at my last job we did our web templates in c++, I shit you not
2011-10-23T23:54:12  <AndrewBC> lolwut
2011-10-23T23:54:12  <jmcarthur> formal specifications don't necessarily give enough detail to make the resulting program efficient
2011-10-23T23:54:45  <teryret> yeah, when you really really _really_ need your page to be as fast as humanly possible, you have to use native code
2011-10-23T23:54:48  <otzi> I do all software design in a whiteboard, then we draw a bunch of things on paper and whatnot
2011-10-23T23:54:55  <teryret> and we needed it to be that fast
2011-10-23T23:55:03  <otzi> then we throw it all away and write something completely different
2011-10-23T23:55:16  <otzi> sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse
2011-10-23T23:55:31  <burny> jmc: a complete design would be sufficient to allow efficient generation
2011-10-23T23:55:43  <jmcarthur> burny: then that's a program, not a "design"
2011-10-23T23:56:06  <teryret> the line is so blurry it probably doesn't exist
2011-10-23T23:56:23  <burny> well, technically.. code is design
2011-10-23T23:56:27  <jmcarthur> burny: to be concrete, i'm talking about specification in the form of logical propositions about the program's behavior at a high level.
2011-10-23T23:56:33  <AndrewBC> code is design implementation
2011-10-23T23:56:56  <jmcarthur> to me, anything lower level than that is leaving the world of specification and moving into the world of development
2011-10-23T23:57:09  <AndrewBC> what you're really saying is you design in your head and then implement it
2011-10-23T23:57:16  <AndrewBC> which is how I roll, by the way
2011-10-23T23:59:16  <jmcarthur> for example, i can perfectly specify what set union means, but there are still many different ways to implement it, each with different performance characteristics
2011-10-23T23:59:31  <jmcarthur> that doesn't mean it's underspecified, though
