2011-11-27T00:15:59  <Antimony> overoptimistic much?
2011-11-27T00:17:34  <BenJackson> wow, me and pguillory had some epic battles on fluxid
2011-11-27T00:17:40  <BenJackson> sadly I lost them all

2011-11-27T00:18:08  <BenJackson> must be a fluke
2011-11-27T00:19:42  <BenJackson> MAHAHA *this* (endgame) is what I spent all my time trying to achieve: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.327
2011-11-27T00:20:42  <BenJackson> almost 500 ants in the hive, wow
2011-11-27T00:24:20  <Antimony> holy cow
2011-11-27T00:24:43  <Antimony> It's a nice problem to have when your ants gather food too fast
2011-11-27T00:24:47  <BenJackson> I also like the massive pile I bury his hill in
2011-11-27T00:24:57  <Antimony> I can't think of any easy way to detect that though
2011-11-27T00:25:10  <Antimony> maybe penalize food gathering when you have more food in teh hive?

2011-11-27T00:31:11  <Antimony> what trick?

2011-11-27T00:32:52  <Antimony> I wonder how far I can get with crappy combat
2011-11-27T00:33:03  <BenJackson> pretty far
2011-11-27T00:33:15  <Antimony> my bot is good at gathering, and I bet that symmetry will givei t a huge edge at exploration
2011-11-27T00:33:18  <BenJackson> just search around the rankings and eyeball whether you think bots have combat

2011-11-27T00:34:49  <Antimony> Hmm, my bot's currently at mu=81.95, so it will probably be top 100 once ranking stablizes
2011-11-27T00:35:04  <besh> How do you stop the tester from opening a browser when game ends? I want to do silent testing with many maps
2011-11-27T00:35:05  <Antimony> and symmetry should push it up even farther
2011-11-27T00:35:08  <BenJackson> your sigma will drop to about 1.6
2011-11-27T00:35:12  <Antimony> there's an option
2011-11-27T00:35:15  <BenJackson> so 81.95 - 1.6*3
2011-11-27T00:35:21  <Antimony> --nolaunch I think

2011-11-27T00:35:57  <Antimony> Of course, my ranking will probably drop like a stone at the end when all the super awesome final combat bots get submitted
2011-11-27T00:36:16  <BenJackson> you have no combat now?  just avoidance?
2011-11-27T00:36:24  <Antimony> well, I sort of have comba
2011-11-27T00:36:37  <Antimony> I assume all enemies are stationary, and then minimize losses
2011-11-27T00:37:27  <BenJackson> wow, at around 100th I don't see significant combat
2011-11-27T00:37:33  <BenJackson> nothing like you see all the time on fluxid
2011-11-27T00:37:43  <Antimony> it's ok when I'm attacking and the defenders are approximately static, but it doesn't work well for defence or 1v1
2011-11-27T00:38:08  <BenJackson> have you watched my games?
2011-11-27T00:38:15  <Antimony> a couple
2011-11-27T00:38:22  <BenJackson> because what I'm doing is not that far from what you're doing
2011-11-27T00:38:47  <Antimony> oh
2011-11-27T00:38:59  <Antimony> you don't try to predict enemy movements or consider different cases?
2011-11-27T00:39:09  <BenJackson> I didn't say that...
2011-11-27T00:40:28  <antimatroid> for each batttle partition i do defensive and offensive moves for my ants and opponents ants and pick my moves from a 2x2 game

2011-11-27T00:41:25  <antimatroid> well, i treat it more like a game tree where i have two moves and the opponents have 2 moves
2011-11-27T00:41:35  <antimatroid> but i think you could pretty much represent it as either and get similar results
2011-11-27T00:41:39  <Antimony> I wonder if anyone is using the payoff matrix approach
2011-11-27T00:41:49  <antimatroid> i don't give states numerical payoffs though, i return an Outcome which has an order operation
2011-11-27T00:42:02  <Antimony> Someone here earlier claimed they oculd do an exact solution over all 5^7+ cases of 6 enemies
2011-11-27T00:42:07  <antimatroid> i store my outcomes in a payoff matrix
2011-11-27T00:42:15  <antimatroid> but make the moves like it's a game tree
2011-11-27T00:42:35  <antimatroid> i did full 1 ply minimax but it was fairly slow
2011-11-27T00:42:43  <antimatroid> for battle partitions
2011-11-27T00:43:03  <antimatroid> although i didn't try and reduce the size of partitions, each parition just had ants that could land in combat with each other
2011-11-27T00:43:18  <AntDroid> if i wanted to get the attack radius squared of the current attack radius plus 2 is it 17?
2011-11-27T00:43:22  <antimatroid> or land in battle with an ant that can land in battle with another ant and so on
2011-11-27T00:43:54  <antimatroid> AntDroid: careful, the euclidean and manhatten metrics aren't equivalent
2011-11-27T00:44:12  <bmh> antimatroid: that still makes me a little bit sad
2011-11-27T00:44:20  <Antimony> What you should do is rad2 + 4*rad1 + 4
2011-11-27T00:44:25  <Antimony> where rad1 is floor of sqrt
2011-11-27T00:44:39  <antimatroid> bmh: me too, i really wish we'd have just gone with manhatten but euclidean does give nicer "circles"
2011-11-27T00:44:51  <antimatroid> i don't like doing stuff like that
2011-11-27T00:44:56  <Antimony> well I think euclidena leads to move interseting tactics
2011-11-27T00:45:02  <Antimony> more interesting
2011-11-27T00:45:04  <BenJackson> my advice:  don't fuck around getting it wrong
2011-11-27T00:45:06  <antimatroid> i just generate translation amounts during turn 0 for what i want
2011-11-27T00:45:14  <BenJackson> I half-assed it on my combat and then when I fixed it had to totally re-trune
2011-11-27T00:45:36  <bmh> my bot is 100% half-assed. I need to get something working again
2011-11-27T00:45:44  <antimatroid> mine is a mess atm
2011-11-27T00:45:51  <antimatroid> i'm not sure trying to generalise path finding was a good idea
2011-11-27T00:46:00  <bmh> antimatroid: amen to that.
2011-11-27T00:46:04  <antimatroid> there's so many little things that need to change depending on the type of path you want to find
2011-11-27T00:46:29  <bmh> I probably should have just gone whole-hog and done APSP
2011-11-27T00:46:36  <AntDroid> i'm currently using this: DistanceEuclidianSquared(row, col, newrow, newcol, Info) <= attRadius + 2 but I cant seem to get the nice circle, it includes some extra squares on the edges
2011-11-27T00:47:11  <BenJackson> it looks fine
2011-11-27T00:47:15  <BenJackson> except +2 is wrong
2011-11-27T00:47:27  <BenJackson> speaking of things I half-assed
2011-11-27T00:47:57  <antimatroid> doing it that way is also dangerous because you don't account for situations like ...a..%b....
2011-11-27T00:48:01  <antimatroid> they can't land in battle
2011-11-27T00:48:16  <BenJackson> a.%.b can fight
2011-11-27T00:48:19  <antimatroid> there's also some other bits of information you can take into account
2011-11-27T00:48:24  <antimatroid> a..%b can't though
2011-11-27T00:48:31  <BenJackson> but +2 is wrong because you want +2 manhattan not +2 euclidean
2011-11-27T00:49:04  <antimatroid> you don't want to waste time considering that a as in a battle when it's not
2011-11-27T00:49:09  <antimatroid> he could do other stuff if he's not needed there
2011-11-27T00:49:13  <BenJackson> that a is in battle
2011-11-27T00:49:21  <antimatroid> not this turn it's not
2011-11-27T00:49:36  <bmh> BenJackson: I bounced this off a1k0n, but I'd like your feedback. My first thought was to find rows and columns of ants and treat each ant as a polya urn with a uniform prior. For a collection of ants (row/column/group/whatever) give them a common goal (East/West, toward a point, etc), reweight their urns and ask if the move is good under minimax
2011-11-27T00:49:43  <BenJackson> if a steps one step closer to the water a and b will die
2011-11-27T00:49:54  <bmh> If the move is good, update the urn, otherwise revert it. Rinse and repeat until it converges (if it ever goes)
2011-11-27T00:50:15  <antimatroid> BenJackson: you just gave me a good idea
2011-11-27T00:50:24  <antimatroid> randomly order my neighbours in each square
2011-11-27T00:50:30  <antimatroid> so path finding doesn't favour a particular direction
2011-11-27T00:50:50  <antimatroid> i can do it with a seed so debugging doesn't become impossible
2011-11-27T00:50:55  * BenJackson learns about polya urns :)
2011-11-27T00:51:05  <bmh> rows and columns are advantageous because you only need to consider East/West and North/South, but I think (combatRadius + 1) might be the best organizing technique
2011-11-27T00:51:38  <BenJackson> I haven't had any trouble writing solvers for this challenge
2011-11-27T00:51:52  <BenJackson> the tricky thing is correctly expressing the "score" in an efficient way
2011-11-27T00:52:00  <antimatroid> do you guys have one path finding function?
2011-11-27T00:52:06  <antimatroid> or do you just rewrite for each use?
2011-11-27T00:52:22  <bmh> antimatroid: yes, but it's broken. Hierarchical A*
2011-11-27T00:52:35  <BenJackson> I don't pathfind except in the limited case of food
2011-11-27T00:52:43  <BenJackson> which I do with plain bfs
2011-11-27T00:52:56  <antimatroid> collecting food is a pita
2011-11-27T00:52:57  <BenJackson> there's never really that much food visible to you
2011-11-27T00:53:04  <antimatroid> because you don't actually want to move your ant onto the targets
2011-11-27T00:53:49  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm going to program
2011-11-27T00:54:01  <BenJackson> haha, strcat_flock tries to jump me, loses hill to drbraskbot:  http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.400
2011-11-27T00:54:07  <BenJackson> these multi-multi-player games are so random
2011-11-27T00:55:30  <besh> Is it possible to store only results with nolaunch option ?
2011-11-27T00:57:17  <Antimony> I use BFS for finding distance to my hill and A* for distance to food
2011-11-27T00:57:31  <besh> I want to automate self-testing between multiple versions of my bot. Maybe there is already a tool for that ?
2011-11-27T00:59:43  <BenJackson> besh: some people set up the website
2011-11-27T00:59:47  <BenJackson> just like the aichallenge.org site
2011-11-27T00:59:53  <BenJackson> or the tcp servers
2011-11-27T01:01:09  <besh> Yes. But I want to do some local testing. I am already playing on the servers
2011-11-27T01:01:22  <BenJackson> you misunderstand
2011-11-27T01:01:29  *** asorman <asorman!70cc287f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.112.204.40.127> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-11-27T01:01:38  <BenJackson> some people clone the git repo, set up the db and webserver, and run the whole thing local
2011-11-27T01:02:10  <besh> Oh I see. But I am not that knowledgabe to do that unfortunately.
2011-11-27T01:06:52  <bmh> BenJackson: now that you've wikipedia'd urns -- does that strategy seem reasonable?
2011-11-27T01:07:51  <BenJackson> (interesting similarity to particle filters, btw)
2011-11-27T01:08:40  <BenJackson> your idea is vaguely along the lines of what I was trying to do for almost the entire time between my last two aichallenge submissions
2011-11-27T01:08:53  <BenJackson> I came up with some mathematically clever things
2011-11-27T01:09:05  <BenJackson> but then when I implemented it I realized that ants can only go 4 directions
2011-11-27T01:09:22  <BenJackson> and at the single-step granularity it's impossible to attribute the actions of any ant to any overall goal
2011-11-27T01:09:45  <BenJackson> so if you want one ant to go toward food, eg, it's likely that 1/4 of your ants will move "toward" that food (or even more)
2011-11-27T01:09:58  <BenJackson> so you can't really weight *against* that because what, is everyone else going to stand still??
2011-11-27T01:10:29  <bmh> I'm going to use separate logic for foraging and fighting. Keep my fighters and foragers separate as best I can
2011-11-27T01:11:07  <BenJackson> my conclusion was that if you wanted to do something (like a maximum weight matching or whatever) of goals and ants you'd have to be doing that optimization on many steps ahead of "now"
2011-11-27T01:11:22  <BenJackson> where distictions in the actions of individual ants began to tell
2011-11-27T01:11:39  <BenJackson> and I noodled about ideas for how to express that
2011-11-27T01:12:05  <BenJackson> if I follow your "east/west/towards a point" idea then it would be to refine that to a point N steps away rather than just "east" or "towards"
2011-11-27T01:12:37  <BenJackson> then maximize where I want everyone to be in N steps
2011-11-27T01:12:42  <BenJackson> then have them all take the 1st step
2011-11-27T01:12:47  <BenJackson> of course the search space goes through the roof
2011-11-27T01:12:55  <bmh> oh, you look ahead more than one turn? wow!
2011-11-27T01:13:08  <BenJackson> no, no, this was what I was trying to do
2011-11-27T01:13:14  <BenJackson> I never got those ideas working
2011-11-27T01:13:43  <BenJackson> I do look ahead in some ways, but I didn't do a "future goal" solver like I wanted to

2011-11-27T01:18:45  <BenJackson> but wants to go south for that food
2011-11-27T01:19:00  <a1k0n> probably something like that
2011-11-27T01:19:03  <amstan> yes, but any kind of pathfinding would fix that problem
2011-11-27T01:19:04  <BenJackson> and those two things cancel out
2011-11-27T01:19:19  <BenJackson> if your anti-self-hill code is low level it will do that
2011-11-27T01:19:29  <amstan> maybe..
2011-11-27T01:19:33  <BenJackson> eg most of my pathfinding considers my hills to be like water
2011-11-27T01:19:39  <amstan> but i guess only a1k0n would know his own bot, lol
2011-11-27T01:19:47  <BenJackson> however there are maps where you can step off your hill into a 1 square niche
2011-11-27T01:20:18  <BenJackson> a1k0n: fix it and resubmit now:  we can climb the ranks together
2011-11-27T01:20:38  <a1k0n> i'm not sure why it didn't just go around the hill.  it's perfectly capable.  my guess is the extra food symmetrically placed to the left and right is somehow cancelling out the ability to go either way (and thus away from either food)
2011-11-27T01:21:13  <BenJackson> it's shit like this
2011-11-27T01:21:18  <BenJackson> and the crazy importance of the first few food
2011-11-27T01:21:23  <BenJackson> that led me to do a bunch of work
2011-11-27T01:21:33  <BenJackson> someone was talking about a TSP solver for the initial game
2011-11-27T01:21:35  <BenJackson> it's not a bad idea
2011-11-27T01:21:55  <BenJackson> 1st turn, observe all food, fully plan everything (including expected ants) and make sure you get an optimal start
2011-11-27T01:22:01  <a1k0n> nice, when i reproduce locally with the same bot it's sending the bot randomly east and west
2011-11-27T01:22:28  <BenJackson> I had a test game at home where the only real difference between the winner and loser was the loser stepped "back" farther into his cave for the 1st food
2011-11-27T01:22:37  <BenJackson> the winner went out and a later ant got the back food
2011-11-27T01:22:48  <BenJackson> winner bot hit all the chokepoints first
2011-11-27T01:23:07  <BenJackson> a1k0n: the replay data has the random seed

2011-11-27T01:26:48  <a1k0n> yeah its prolly worth optimising the very early game food collection
2011-11-27T01:27:33  <BenJackson> haha watch all my ants at the verrry end of this: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.438
2011-11-27T01:27:49  <BenJackson> you can tell without even watching any specific ants when I finally spot your hill
2011-11-27T01:28:10  <a1k0n> haha
2011-11-27T01:28:17  <BenJackson> that map alone has me seriously considering symmetry detection
2011-11-27T01:28:22  <BenJackson> I'd have know where your hill was farr sooner
2011-11-27T01:28:36  <a1k0n> yeah otherwise they take forever

2011-11-27T01:34:21  <BenJackson> you have to watch the multi-hill maps so many times to see everything
2011-11-27T01:35:37  <BenJackson> starting around 480 in the upper left you help me out

2011-11-27T01:38:08  <BenJackson> I had to go back and slow it down to see how I won
2011-11-27T01:38:24  <BenJackson> that's awesome
2011-11-27T01:42:08  <a1k0n> mostlly yellow killed himself?
2011-11-27T01:45:17  <BenJackson> a blue ant sneaks in behind for the final kill
2011-11-27T01:45:41  <BenJackson> there's a blue ant in the hallway
2011-11-27T01:46:32  <Antimony> why do you stop your ants from walkign on the hill? They might get stuck
2011-11-27T01:46:43  <Antimony> I only prevent walking on the hill if my bot is sure that it has stored food
2011-11-27T01:48:04  <BenJackson> I never got around to estimating food storage
2011-11-27T01:49:29  <Antimony> anyway, I'm going to bed. Hopefully I can figure out how to get symmetry working tomorrow morning

2011-11-27T09:37:14  <mcstar> he is here often
2011-11-27T09:37:25  <mcstar> @seen unclevasya
2011-11-27T09:37:25  <contestbot> mcstar: unclevasya was last seen in #aichallenge 1 day, 22 hours, 19 minutes, and 32 seconds ago: <UncleVasya> on PlanetWars early rush was effective too.
2011-11-27T09:39:05  <Dlayne> do you need this tool?
2011-11-27T09:39:36  <olexs> if it works with current playgame.py, yes
2011-11-27T09:40:57  <Dlayne> it should work
2011-11-27T09:41:00  <Dlayne> email
2011-11-27T09:42:50  <olexs> Dlayne: sent in pm
2011-11-27T09:42:50  <Dlayne> but i faced a problem with his tool and created my onw, with blackjack and..
2011-11-27T09:43:03  <olexs> what problem?
2011-11-27T09:43:41  <Dlayne> it crashes when i press "playgame"
2011-11-27T09:43:58  <olexs> okay, that is a problem all right :)
2011-11-27T09:44:09  <ikaros> =)
2011-11-27T09:44:35  <olexs> I used it a few times back in the beta, there were problems when playgame.py was changed a few times, and I don't think I ever used it since the start
2011-11-27T09:45:56  <olexs> I should probably stop being lazy and write my own, too...
2011-11-27T09:49:43  <Dlayne> UncleVasya dont have this issue.

2011-11-27T10:29:36  <Ruuhkis> Anyone feeling like giving a eye on my bots pathfinder that i cant figure whats wrong with (path gets generated (tried on another test class) but ant doesn't seem to move through the path no matter what :( I've been debugging it for a day or so, if someone smarter could have a eye on it?
2011-11-27T10:30:37  <Ruuhkis> Its a* btw, I have had experience with it inbefore and it works as i said but my ants doesn't like it :(
2011-11-27T10:37:06  <Anilm3> you can try the new visualizer
2011-11-27T10:37:12  <Anilm3> http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1633
2011-11-27T10:37:16  <Anilm3> it may help you debug
2011-11-27T10:37:49  <Ruuhkis> I maybe got it
2011-11-27T10:38:29  <Ruuhkis> It seems like every turn the path gets reset.. So the tile in myAnts() ins't the ant actually, its just the tile that the ant is on? so if i give tile a path its not on the ant, its on the tile?

2011-11-27T11:11:55  <Ruuhkis> darn my pathfinding isnt working
2011-11-27T11:12:03  <Ruuhkis> every turn the path magically sets to null
2011-11-27T11:12:19  <pairofdice> It's not magical if you set it to null
2011-11-27T11:12:24  <avdg> Ruuhkis: which pathfinder are you using?
2011-11-27T11:12:52  <Ruuhkis> avdg I am using a*
2011-11-27T11:13:03  <Ruuhkis> and i dont know how to pm here if that was a PM you sent
2011-11-27T11:13:10  <avdg> hmm, did you implement bfs before?
2011-11-27T11:13:19  <Ruuhkis> bfs? ;o
2011-11-27T11:13:24  <Ruuhkis> pfs?
2011-11-27T11:13:30  <avdg> breath first search
2011-11-27T11:13:35  <Ruuhkis> ooh, nah
2011-11-27T11:13:48  <avdg> if you can implement that one, extend a little bit, you have a, a*
2011-11-27T11:13:52  <avdg> *an
2011-11-27T11:13:54  <Ruuhkis> but the path got generated etc. but all the sudden its null
2011-11-27T11:14:11  <pairofdice> How do you know if it got generated
2011-11-27T11:14:15  <Ruuhkis> debug
2011-11-27T11:14:22  <Ruuhkis> it prints clearly that it got the path
2011-11-27T11:14:33  <Ruuhkis> and then when its the next turn
2011-11-27T11:14:34  <Ruuhkis> it says its null :(
2011-11-27T11:14:39  <Ruuhkis> and generates new..
2011-11-27T11:14:45  <mcstar> obviously you dont understand the starter bot if you are using it
2011-11-27T11:14:57  <Ruuhkis> so whats the problem ?:(
2011-11-27T11:15:08  <avdg> we don't have any code or debug information
2011-11-27T11:15:10  <Ruuhkis> and yes I am using it
2011-11-27T11:15:10  <pairofdice> It's a bit hard to say
2011-11-27T11:15:23  <Ruuhkis> i show you debug info and i can upload code too :)
2011-11-27T11:15:24  <Ruuhkis> second
2011-11-27T11:15:44  * avdg doesn't know if it would be smart to upload the code

2011-11-27T11:16:17  <Ruuhkis> LOL ;)
2011-11-27T11:16:31  <Ruuhkis> the ( number ) is the "id" of ant
2011-11-27T11:16:43  <pairofdice> typo overlaod
2011-11-27T11:16:59  <Ruuhkis> lol, i wrote ramdom glibbish
2011-11-27T11:17:10  <Ruuhkis> gibberish*
2011-11-27T11:17:59  <avdg> hmm, is it fixed?
2011-11-27T11:18:04  <Ruuhkis> nope :(
2011-11-27T11:18:09  <Ruuhkis> if you read the debug
2011-11-27T11:18:12  <Ruuhkis> it says in end of turn
2011-11-27T11:18:15  <Ruuhkis> that it has like 3 tiles on path
2011-11-27T11:18:16  <avdg> (well, maybe it would be ok if you add the path in your debug information)
2011-11-27T11:18:22  <Ruuhkis> but on next turn of that ant it says its null
2011-11-27T11:18:38  <Ruuhkis> but how can it turn into null anyway? but i can ad :3
2011-11-27T11:18:40  <Ruuhkis> add*
2011-11-27T11:19:19  <avdg> it smells like you still using the wrong variables
2011-11-27T11:19:33  <avdg> as return information
2011-11-27T11:20:13  <Ruuhkis> http://pastebin.com/XyPKwAm0
2011-11-27T11:20:23  <Ruuhkis> i can show you code
2011-11-27T11:20:25  <Ruuhkis> ALL the code
2011-11-27T11:20:27  <Ruuhkis> its nothing much
2011-11-27T11:20:32  <Ruuhkis> just basic
2011-11-27T11:20:59  <avdg> how did you get the number of steps?
2011-11-27T11:20:59  <Ruuhkis> its java code anyway

2011-11-27T11:21:27  <Ruuhkis> have a look
2011-11-27T11:21:53  <avdg> I don't directly see any return value
2011-11-27T11:22:08  <Ruuhkis> "return path;"
2011-11-27T11:22:15  <Ruuhkis> and it also prints it was there :o
2011-11-27T11:22:19  <avdg> not in the paste
2011-11-27T11:22:23  <mcstar> that debug info is useless
2011-11-27T11:22:27  <Ruuhkis> what are you looking at?
2011-11-27T11:22:34  <Ruuhkis> what should i debug mr mcstar?
2011-11-27T11:22:51  <mcstar> "name of variable" - "value of variable"
2011-11-27T11:22:56  <avdg> Ruuhkis: just do a search on "return"
2011-11-27T11:22:59  <mcstar> and no nonsense
2011-11-27T11:23:10  <Ruuhkis> avdg - where you made that search?
2011-11-27T11:23:18  <avdg> on the pastebin
2011-11-27T11:23:21  <Ruuhkis> avdg the path finding code is on the second pastebin i sent
2011-11-27T11:23:23  <Ruuhkis> pathfinding*
2011-11-27T11:23:30  <avdg> ah
2011-11-27T11:23:34  <Ruuhkis> lol :)
2011-11-27T11:23:34  <avdg> srr
2011-11-27T11:23:42  <Ruuhkis> all good
2011-11-27T11:24:17  <Ruuhkis> and sorry for messy code, bad debug etc. I only have 2yr of programming experience :e trying to learn through this :3
2011-11-27T11:26:17  <avdg> it looks fine
2011-11-27T11:26:21  <Ruuhkis> yeah..
2011-11-27T11:26:26  <avdg> maybe an issue with the code that uses it
2011-11-27T11:26:33  <Ruuhkis> hmm?
2011-11-27T11:26:37  <Ruuhkis> how could it null my path :@
2011-11-27T11:26:37  <Ruuhkis> lol
2011-11-27T11:26:50  <Ruuhkis> maybe if i made list of pathes?
2011-11-27T11:27:01  <avdg> what if you write a small test? :p
2011-11-27T11:27:16  <Ruuhkis> what kind of test you're talking about ?:o
2011-11-27T11:27:25  <avdg> (meh, putting a map into a test would be not easy)
2011-11-27T11:27:27  <avdg> unit test
2011-11-27T11:27:50  <avdg> load map, mark 2 points, get path
2011-11-27T11:29:06  <Ruuhkis> but the map works, the problem is somehow it seems to "forget" the path.. :( I am trying to give each ant unique id and then make map that contains path for each id and then.. I'll see what happens and report back! :D
2011-11-27T11:29:30  <pairofdice> Half of that code is error printing :)
2011-11-27T11:29:32  <avdg> yeah, you just have to test if the path is longer than 1
2011-11-27T11:29:48  <avdg> dependent on what you expect
2011-11-27T11:31:30  <mcstar> are you trying to assign paths permanently?
2011-11-27T11:31:42  <mcstar> are you assigning id's to ants each turn?
2011-11-27T11:35:51  <avdg> Ruuhkis: instead of passing a new object, what would be the result if you put that piece of code in 2 lines?
2011-11-27T11:36:16  <Ruuhkis> mcstar, yes I am
2011-11-27T11:36:26  <Ruuhkis> what is happening to ants in each turn for real? :o
2011-11-27T11:36:30  <Ruuhkis> O___O
2011-11-27T11:36:35  <avdg> I already got in problems in c++ by passing an object with a new keyword, but there could be other issues as well (and you can add more debug information)
2011-11-27T11:36:35  <mcstar> they cease to exist
2011-11-27T11:36:37  <Ruuhkis> I am lost *taking a look at superclass*
2011-11-27T11:36:58  <mcstar> Ruuhkis: the starter packs dont preserve state
2011-11-27T11:37:00  <Ruuhkis> oh my god..
2011-11-27T11:37:05  <mcstar> at least i dont think so
2011-11-27T11:38:41  <Ruuhkis> oh noes..
2011-11-27T11:39:28  <pairofdice> Doesn't stop you from saving state though
2011-11-27T11:39:45  <Antimony> Ug, my bot decided to hallucinate immaginary food
2011-11-27T11:40:11  <Ruuhkis> this explains a lot
2011-11-27T11:40:12  <mcstar> Antimony: i think it hallucinates REAL food no?
2011-11-27T11:40:21  <avdg> glad your bot is thinking positive Antimony
2011-11-27T11:40:22  <Antimony> lol
2011-11-27T11:40:46  <Ruuhkis> what did you feed your bot with? wow
2011-11-27T11:40:53  <mcstar> shrooms
2011-11-27T11:41:00  <avdg> ants
2011-11-27T11:41:03  <Ruuhkis> why do it clear the state every turn? just wondering?
2011-11-27T11:41:12  <mcstar> Ruuhkis: why not?
2011-11-27T11:41:21  <Ruuhkis> :( because i lose their states too! :D
2011-11-27T11:41:23  <mcstar> why dont you read the source before you are going mad?
2011-11-27T11:41:27  <avdg> because its more complicated to track the changes between every turn?
2011-11-27T11:41:39  <avdg> doesn't mean you don't have to do that
2011-11-27T11:42:37  <Ruuhkis> hmm..
2011-11-27T11:43:04  <Ruuhkis> what should i do? what should i do? *tears hair out of head*
2011-11-27T11:43:38  <avdg> throw things you don't need away until you have 1 thing to focus at?
2011-11-27T11:44:06  <avdg> and with throwing away things, I don't mean code
2011-11-27T11:44:32  <pairofdice> Girlfriend, job
2011-11-27T11:44:45  <avdg> :p
2011-11-27T11:44:51  <Antimony> ohh wow
2011-11-27T11:44:57  <Antimony> All this time it turns out there was a real food there
2011-11-27T11:45:01  <Antimony> my bot isn't crazy after all
2011-11-27T11:45:02  <pairofdice> :D
2011-11-27T11:45:26  <Antimony> I never realized it was possible for food to spawn right next to the hill like that
2011-11-27T11:46:37  <Ruuhkis> sooo.. should i make it so each tile has its path and take the path from the tile map which state doesnt get cleared to the and on the tile or just modify how they're updated ? :(
2011-11-27T11:47:08  <Antimony> Wow
2011-11-27T11:47:23  <Ruuhkis> what have you guys done with ur pathfinders? :o
2011-11-27T11:47:26  <Antimony> My current bot has already beaten my previous bot's skill, and it's only played 18 games instead of 80
2011-11-27T11:47:37  <Antimony> I don't really do pathfinding
2011-11-27T11:47:42  <Antimony> well
2011-11-27T11:47:46  <Antimony> I don't store paths
2011-11-27T11:47:59  <pairofdice> Me neither, also, mine is broken
2011-11-27T11:48:03  <Ruuhkis> you generate new path each turn?
2011-11-27T11:48:12  <Antimony> I don't generate a path at all
2011-11-27T11:48:17  <Antimony> It's implicit in the distance map
2011-11-27T11:48:30  <Antimony> You only need the first step after all
2011-11-27T11:49:12  <Ruuhkis> I don't understand how can you avoid obstacles without having to walk there and here 100 times without generating path?
2011-11-27T11:49:26  <pairofdice> What
2011-11-27T11:49:44  <Antimony> A journey of 20000 squares begins with a single step :)
2011-11-27T11:49:55  <avdg> lol
2011-11-27T11:50:16  <Ruuhkis> true :)
2011-11-27T11:50:29  <Ruuhkis> so pathfinder is a bad idea?
2011-11-27T11:50:37  <pairofdice> Well, it's still a path
2011-11-27T11:50:39  <avdg> bad and good
2011-11-27T11:50:40  <mcstar> Antimony: wtf?
2011-11-27T11:50:51  <Ruuhkis> i should just let my ant guess?
2011-11-27T11:51:07  <avdg> well, mine gets rank 1600 for doing that
2011-11-27T11:51:17  <Antimony> I'm just pointing out that there's no need to store paths. You only need the distance, and then you can use graident descent
2011-11-27T11:51:20  <avdg> it may actually perform a little bit better
2011-11-27T11:51:38  <avdg> (which is still my js implementation)
2011-11-27T11:51:47  <pairofdice> My ants are too stupid to calculate partial derivates
2011-11-27T11:51:51  <Ruuhkis> *looks at wikipedia article*
2011-11-27T11:52:30  <mcstar> Antimony: you need the path if you are looking for an optimal path, notwithstanding how many step you are using from it
2011-11-27T11:52:34  <Antimony> Ug, my symmetry detector still refuses to work
2011-11-27T11:52:48  <Antimony> IF you have the distance to each square, the path is implicit.
2011-11-27T11:53:07  <Antimony> On each step, you go the direction that decreases distance
2011-11-27T11:53:08  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-27T11:53:27  <mcstar> you have all the minimal distance from every point to every point?
2011-11-27T11:53:29  <Ruuhkis> yeah but what if you're next to looon wall
2011-11-27T11:53:31  <Ruuhkis> looong*
2011-11-27T11:54:25  <pairofdice> What Antimony is saying that pepper-spray is a food product, essentially
2011-11-27T11:54:41  <Antimony> no
2011-11-27T11:54:54  <Antimony> you only need the minimal distance from any dest to your ant
2011-11-27T11:55:03  <Antimony> how much you store is up to you
2011-11-27T11:55:11  <pairofdice> I know, I'm doing the same thing, but it's still pathfinding
2011-11-27T11:55:21  <mcstar> Antimony: you have to do a bfs for that

2011-11-27T12:24:01  <Fluxid> cell_maze_p02_05.map is hard
2011-11-27T12:26:28  <besh> My ants cluster on that map for  no reason. At first I supsected a bug in my path finding but later I saw other bots get in the same problem.
2011-11-27T12:28:44  <Fluxid> it's just hard to discover enemy's hill
2011-11-27T12:28:54  <Fluxid> because you need to enter the cave to see it
2011-11-27T12:30:31  <besh> yes with those thick walls
2011-11-27T12:30:36  <besh> waters*
2011-11-27T12:33:55  <Antimony> Hopefully the symmetry I'm working on will help with that
2011-11-27T12:34:27  <g0llum> Antinomy, what are you trying to do about symmetry ?
2011-11-27T12:35:37  <Antimony> I'm trying to add symmetry detection to my bot
2011-11-27T12:35:42  <Antimony> so it can find hills without ever having seen them
2011-11-27T12:35:56  <Antimony> I've been debugging it all mornign but it still isn't working
2011-11-27T12:36:23  <Antimony> is it even possible to have rotational symmetry on a nonsquare map?
2011-11-27T12:37:21  <Fluxid> i don't think so
2011-11-27T12:38:07  <g0llum> a erctangle can be just a projection of a square, some transformation inbetween
2011-11-27T12:38:44  <g0llum> so you can't guess from the shape
2011-11-27T12:39:58  <Antimony> hmm
2011-11-27T12:40:10  <Antimony> I think it is impossible to have rotation on rectanuglar maps in normal circumstances
2011-11-27T12:40:15  <Antimony> that will simplifiy things immensly
2011-11-27T12:42:21  <besh> Is food also placed symmetrically ?

2011-11-27T14:21:59  <avdg> my dad can't work with a computer, even after 20 years :p
2011-11-27T14:22:29  <avdg> (and is still taking big effort in learning to)
2011-11-27T14:22:40  <mcstar> sweet '92, my first year in elementary
2011-11-27T14:22:53  <Fluxid> my parents still mistake double/single/right clicks
2011-11-27T14:23:21  <avdg> my dad can't remember passwords/locations
2011-11-27T14:23:28  <avdg> (file locations)
2011-11-27T14:23:33  <pairofdice> I can't remember passwords either
2011-11-27T14:23:38  <Fluxid> ok, my python bot has 600 lines of C code
2011-11-27T14:23:44  <Fluxid> i wonder is that okay
2011-11-27T14:23:52  <avdg> well, he confuses them
2011-11-27T14:23:52  <BenJackson> my C++ bot has 0 lines of python ;-)
2011-11-27T14:24:11  <mcstar> Fluxid: is it more than the python locs?
2011-11-27T14:24:25  <Fluxid> mcstar: not yet
2011-11-27T14:24:57  <Fluxid> mcstar: i have 1196 lines of python code... oh boy
2011-11-27T14:25:09  <amstan> Fluxid: is it all in one file?
2011-11-27T14:25:17  <BenJackson> so in my game against ifdef he got ahead of me while we mopped up the weaker bots (7-5) but then I was about to take his hill and killed every one of his ants.  The visualizer shows a bonus of "2" (so, 7-7) but I think the engine properly deducted his hill (so 7-6) because I'm alone in 1st
2011-11-27T14:25:20  <Fluxid> amstan: fortunately not
2011-11-27T14:25:22  <mcstar> 600 of c is pretty much id say
2011-11-27T14:25:24  <amstan> Fluxid: good, lol
2011-11-27T14:25:25  <BenJackson> is that just a bug in the visualizer?  or in the replay output?

2011-11-27T14:28:16  <Antimony> My bot decided that there can't possible be any enemies as soon as it sees it's first hill :(
2011-11-27T14:28:24  <avdg> mcstar: how did you write that much loc?

2011-11-27T14:29:03  <BenJackson> a1k0n: is your fluxid bot in sync with your aichallenge submit?
2011-11-27T14:29:16  <BenJackson> since resubmitting I'm trying to guess where I'll end up :)
2011-11-27T14:29:33  <Fluxid> BenJackson: what do you mean?
2011-11-27T14:29:49  <a1k0n> nope
2011-11-27T14:29:54  <a1k0n> it's ahead
2011-11-27T14:30:08  <BenJackson> "ahead", ah, I'm all to familiar with that ;-)
2011-11-27T14:30:12  <BenJackson> Fluxid: ?
2011-11-27T14:30:16  <a1k0n> well, it's about 1 skill point better
2011-11-27T14:30:22  <a1k0n> (on fluxid's rankings)
2011-11-27T14:30:24  <mcstar> huh, ok, i have a base.1.cpp and base.off.cpp aka base.cpp, poor man's version control....
2011-11-27T14:31:08  <a1k0n> i'm really frustrated with how terrible my combat is, and at the same time surprised such a stupid approach works so well
2011-11-27T14:31:28  <mcstar> a1k0n: your bot takes the initiative
2011-11-27T14:31:46  <a1k0n> yeah, and bots like pguillory just wait for me to kill myself on their wall of ants
2011-11-27T14:31:54  <Antimony> my ant is in denial about the existence of enemies
2011-11-27T14:32:05  <a1k0n> probably better off that way
2011-11-27T14:33:43  <BenJackson> yeah, my previous submit (v7) was aggressive/blundering sort of combat
2011-11-27T14:33:52  <BenJackson> smart enough to beat or trade evenly in most cases
2011-11-27T14:34:05  <BenJackson> but against "real" combat it would suicide
2011-11-27T14:34:35  <BenJackson> after I fixed that I had to re-tune everything to regain any aggression
2011-11-27T14:34:55  <a1k0n> i haven't tried tweaking my constants in a while
2011-11-27T14:35:06  <BenJackson> still I just watched a game against 500ish ranked bots on aichallenge where I carefully got out of the way of a blundering ant
2011-11-27T14:35:16  <BenJackson> which I probably should have just suicided to get out of my way
2011-11-27T14:36:09  <mcstar> aham
2011-11-27T14:36:12  <mcstar> "constants"
2011-11-27T14:36:17  <mcstar> thats whats missing from my bot

2011-11-27T14:37:11  <besh> a1kOn: So true about pguillory. That is what I just implemented and it is starting to play like it.
2011-11-27T14:37:37  <a1k0n> besh: you implemented the patient wall of ants?
2011-11-27T14:37:42  <mcstar> and no i dont have constants, only those that the engine provides
2011-11-27T14:37:55  <besh> yes I just form a wall of ants at attack_radius + 2
2011-11-27T14:38:01  <a1k0n> ah
2011-11-27T14:38:08  <BenJackson> I was thikning my bot nearly broke this seige:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=135711&user=3473
2011-11-27T14:38:13  <BenJackson> then I saw how many ants yellow had in his hive
2011-11-27T14:38:17  <besh> and they come and collide. But before I used to take the initiative
2011-11-27T14:38:18  <BenJackson> no wonder my assault failed
2011-11-27T14:39:25  <mcstar> a1k0n: you said you can tune things, i cant
2011-11-27T14:39:42  <mcstar> i guess you have some sort of linear combination of things
2011-11-27T14:39:52  <mcstar> i dont want to go that way
2011-11-27T14:40:14  <mcstar> have you put that q-learning stuff into your bot?
2011-11-27T14:40:22  <a1k0n> no.
2011-11-27T14:40:48  <mcstar> i wondered if i could use it to teach my bot whether an enemy is behaving retionally in battle
2011-11-27T14:41:05  <mcstar> a*
2011-11-27T14:43:05  <mcstar> theres this other thing i came across
2011-11-27T14:43:10  <mcstar> random forests
2011-11-27T14:43:40  <mcstar> pretty interesting, but i havent figured out how to put that into good use
2011-11-27T14:43:53  <mcstar> another thing that might be interesting is the SVM
2011-11-27T14:44:22  <mcstar> i guess you know about these
2011-11-27T14:44:23  *** nathanro11 <nathanro11!5ad7db6d@gateway/web/freenode/ip.90.215.219.109> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-27T14:44:45  <BenJackson> hidden markov models or particle filters would be good ways to measure enemy behavior
2011-11-27T14:45:08  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2011-11-27T14:45:15  <mcstar> svm can do that i think
2011-11-27T14:45:31  <pairofdice> How about particle filters to predict enemy hills
2011-11-27T14:45:32  <mcstar> and theres some ultra-flexible implementation out there with non-linear kernels
2011-11-27T14:45:38  <BenJackson> I think svm is overkill
2011-11-27T14:45:54  <BenJackson> SVM would be able to learn about patterns of moves and quickly classify a bot (given that you had lots of prior knowledge)
2011-11-27T14:46:08  <BenJackson> you can use much simpler stuff if you just want to reason from nothing in each new game
2011-11-27T14:46:29  <mcstar> so you are saying that i could train it on tcp
2011-11-27T14:46:56  <mcstar> and it would be faster to actually upload the training data, then letting it train itself in every new game
2011-11-27T14:47:09  <mcstar> faster->better idk
2011-11-27T14:47:39  <BenJackson> a SVM learns to classify examples
2011-11-27T14:48:09  <BenJackson> a HMM would be a simple matter of the hidden probability of rationality of the other bot
2011-11-27T14:48:14  <mcstar> yeah, its a binary classifier in a many dimensinal space
2011-11-27T14:48:14  <BenJackson> which you observe as moves
2011-11-27T14:48:38  <BenJackson> in a HMM you would look at how rational a bot is each turn as you encounter it
2011-11-27T14:48:57  <BenJackson> and the model assumes that your observation of rationality is a product of the hidden *actual* rationality

2011-11-27T14:49:03  <mcstar> idk about that, my idea was to see if the enemy follows my rational evaluation function or not
2011-11-27T14:49:08  <pairofdice> I think it would be pretty easy to use particle filter to predict enemy hill locations

2011-11-27T14:49:51  <BenJackson> I implemented "hill intuition" if you like
2011-11-27T14:50:01  <BenJackson> the problem was I would "discover" hills too early
2011-11-27T14:50:11  <mcstar> pairofdice: you mean guessing the hill positions from the motion of the enemy?
2011-11-27T14:50:25  <BenJackson> my bot was actually better off only knowing about hills as it expanded and in the order it found them
2011-11-27T14:50:49  <BenJackson> knowing about a hill on the far end of the map just meant my ants wanted to cross enemy territory to make a remote assault befroe taking care of business at home
2011-11-27T14:51:01  <mcstar> :)
2011-11-27T14:51:23  <mcstar> it would make sense on big maps with few players

2011-11-27T15:05:59  <mcstar> he says it "doesnt know" where it is
2011-11-27T15:06:11  <mcstar> and it gets into a room, so it now does?

2011-11-27T15:08:05  <mcstar> doesnt make sense to me
2011-11-27T15:08:08  <pairofdice> And the hallway was perfeclty symmetrical so it had to move to a room to resolve it's position
2011-11-27T15:08:09  <mcstar> sorry :D
2011-11-27T15:08:28  <pairofdice> It's not that complicated

2011-11-27T15:09:00  <mcstar> and you think i know that but i dont
2011-11-27T15:09:58  <mcstar> ill search for this localization problem
2011-11-27T15:10:22  <pairofdice> Well the robot knows the map and it's dropped at a random poisitoon
2011-11-27T15:10:30  <pairofdice> It only has sonar range sensors

2011-11-27T17:01:58  <pairofdice> It looks like an.. elephant
2011-11-27T17:03:35  <Fluxid> i see an angry bear

2011-11-27T17:04:47  <jab_bott> yeah - what Minthos said
2011-11-27T17:05:23  <HaraKiri> is that a rorschach test? :D
2011-11-27T17:05:33  <pairofdice> Overlayerer brings my computer to it's knees

2011-11-27T17:06:16  <Fluxid> it rather brings java to knees
2011-11-27T17:06:53  <jab_bott> pairofdice: are you using the vis_overlay fork?
2011-11-27T17:06:56  <Fluxid> java visualizer works few times slower than inside normal browser
2011-11-27T17:07:03  <HaraKiri> i still find it interesting that the thing can draw thousands of colored tiles, but as soon as you use the text strings, it becomes borderline unusable :(
2011-11-27T17:07:04  <pairofdice> jab_bott: yeah
2011-11-27T17:07:37  <jab_bott> pairofdice: yeah - it's very easy to get carried away and put too much stuff in there, especially since I added the 'i' commands for map-info
2011-11-27T17:07:44  <pairofdice> I had it just filling tiles with color
2011-11-27T17:08:04  <jab_bott> pairofdice: you just have to stick to visualizing a few things at a time and keeping the output small so you're not there all day
2011-11-27T17:08:14  <pairofdice> Yeah
2011-11-27T17:08:51  <jab_bott> HaraKiri: yeah - I don't fully understand that either
2011-11-27T17:10:09  <jab_bott> HaraKiri: the data is massive though
2011-11-27T17:10:31  <HaraKiri> hmm but it doesn't get slow after thousands if i's, it gets slow after 2 or 3
2011-11-27T17:10:45  <jab_bott> Fluxid: can you help me to get the stand-alone visualizer running? I posted about it on the ai state thread on the forums

2011-11-27T17:16:46  <jab_bott> HaraKiri: maybe there's a rate-limit (like there was in worker.py for reading bot output) on writing out the data too?
2011-11-27T17:16:53  <olexs1> sometimes, instead of the total rankings, it will only display the rankings for "Other" (organisation)
2011-11-27T17:17:14  <HaraKiri> oh no i haven't looked at the new code at all
2011-11-27T17:17:31  <jab_bott> Fluxid: could you paste me a playgame.py command that works in the java visualizer on epsilon branch?
2011-11-27T17:18:00  <HaraKiri> where's the "new" stuff it in jab_bott?
2011-11-27T17:18:05  <Fluxid> O_o
2011-11-27T17:18:44  <jab_bott> Fluxid: I honestly think it's something really stupid that I'm just missing

2011-11-27T17:19:15  <Fluxid> but it plays a game ant doesn't launch anything..

2011-11-27T17:19:41  <jab_bott> HaraKiri: what new stuff? The last thing I added was the i command - nothing since then (although I made lines and arrows go the shortest wrapped distance - can't remember if that was before or after)
2011-11-27T17:20:17  <HaraKiri> yeah i was more thinking where in the file, but i found it :D

2011-11-27T17:54:24  <thestinger> well right now I'm just doing 3 possible sets of moves - running away, staying still or moving towards the enemy
2011-11-27T17:54:51  <mcstar> so basically you enumerate, but prune a little in front
2011-11-27T17:55:56  <antimatroid> thestinger: i am
2011-11-27T17:56:00  <thestinger> my old "combat" (current bots on tcp) just cancels moves for ants that are going to die if the enemy doesn't move
2011-11-27T17:56:15  <antimatroid> i partition ants up into those that can battle an enemy in the same partition
2011-11-27T17:56:20  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-27T17:56:22  <antimatroid> then do defensive and offensive moves, and pick them off that
2011-11-27T17:56:30  <thestinger> I divide up everything into battles

2011-11-27T18:02:04  <mcstar> but with generating only 1 turn....
2011-11-27T18:02:17  <AntDroid> is anyone doing attacking an enemy ant from just one direction or in all directions?
2011-11-27T18:02:34  <mcstar> i try from any direction
2011-11-27T18:02:47  <mcstar> i.e. my ants could be anywhere in relation the the enemy
2011-11-27T18:02:56  <mcstar> i have a new grouping method in mind
2011-11-27T18:03:06  <mcstar> but im nowhere near finished
2011-11-27T18:03:30  <AntDroid> is it better that just attacking in one direction? top bots eems to attack in just one direction (pguillory, xathis)
2011-11-27T18:03:37  <AntDroid> seems*
2011-11-27T18:05:39  <AntDroid> the attacks coming from all directions i think will only work well with static enemy ants but not when they are moving
2011-11-27T18:05:56  <mcstar> i dont agree
2011-11-27T18:06:31  <thestinger> I just do a BFS from the current enemy ant locations and mark off distances - then use that to move towards/away from or strafe/encircle
2011-11-27T18:06:42  <thestinger> it doesn't really matter if they move
2011-11-27T18:06:49  <thestinger> they are still in the same direction for the most part
2011-11-27T18:07:12  <thestinger> I really need to finish off this code and start testing it :P
2011-11-27T18:08:13  <AntDroid> the problem i could see is that when you encircle an enemy ant and it decides to move in any direction, it will get into attackRadius of one of your ants, so instead of killing it, it and your ant is killed
2011-11-27T18:08:58  <a1k0n_> not if you outnumber them everywhere
2011-11-27T18:09:19  <AntDroid> while attack from a single direction will make sure that enemy ant will be crushed in your wall of ant when they couldn't get away
2011-11-27T18:09:37  <thestinger> I plan on dealing with stuff like that with tiebreakers
2011-11-27T18:09:55  <thestinger> so if an ant could move in 2+ directions to get closer to a target, I'll figure out which will be better
2011-11-27T18:09:57  <AntDroid> a1kon: you have a point
2011-11-27T18:10:28  <antimatroid1> i path find to enemies while blocking path finding with my ants
2011-11-27T18:10:34  <antimatroid1> so it'll slowly surround the buggers
2011-11-27T18:10:44  <thestinger> that's what strcat_flock does on the tcp server - the tie breaker is based on allies in attack range
2011-11-27T18:10:59  <thestinger> it doesn't actually seem to work though :)
2011-11-27T18:11:46  <antimatroid1> it will also divert ants around to enemies from all paths if you block up one way
2011-11-27T18:11:56  <antimatroid1> instead of just piling up ants where they get blocked up
2011-11-27T18:12:04  <thestinger> antimatroid1: yeah, I do something similar (I increase the cost of a path going through a location one of my ants is at)
2011-11-27T18:12:24  <thestinger> but I'm pretty conservative about it atm because it makes my ants spread out too far
2011-11-27T18:13:42  <AntDroid> thats a good idea. my current implementation just counts if my possible attacks to an enemy ants is greater the enemy ant can attack me. been stuck with it for 2 weeks now, i relly need to make my battle code better. :)
2011-11-27T18:14:07  <AntDroid> really*

2011-11-27T18:34:54  <thestinger> I still don't have my real combat code done :)
2011-11-27T18:35:57  <thestinger> the reason they back away from you sometimes is basically this thought process:
2011-11-27T18:36:32  <thestinger> "oh crap, there are a bunch of enemies. I'm just going to go forage, the hive mind is an idiot for telling me to attack their hill."
2011-11-27T18:36:38  <thestinger> it's sort of a result of a "bug"
2011-11-27T18:37:46  <thestinger> will be fixed and done properly in my latest combat attempt
2011-11-27T18:38:35  <thestinger> I make my foragers avoid enemies if there is likely more than one enemy left
2011-11-27T18:38:38  <BenJackson> I meant the vast pouring of ants toward my base
2011-11-27T18:38:43  <thestinger> oh :)
2011-11-27T18:38:50  <thestinger> well, if orange had died they would have killed you faster

2011-11-27T18:40:04  <thestinger> because they are closest to that area

2011-11-27T18:41:26  <BenJackson> interesting
2011-11-27T18:41:32  <thestinger> and the ants closest to you (the battle line) are chosen for foraging until they get close to you

2011-11-27T18:54:08  <thestinger> I bet having to use the python types slows it down
2011-11-27T18:54:27  <Fluxid> i need to profile it
2011-11-27T18:54:32  <BenJackson> yeah, if you're refcounting and etc you should translate entirely into C, do the calc, then entirely back out

2011-11-27T18:54:58  <BenJackson> this is why I used C++:  I can write gnarly code for the tight inner loop stuff

2011-11-27T18:55:11  <BenJackson> but the high level code can still deal with lists/sets/etc of ants

2011-11-27T18:55:37  <Fluxid> yeah, but not often
2011-11-27T18:55:44  <thestinger> that's probably more expensive than how I imagine python allocates memory
2011-11-27T18:55:57  <thestinger> I know that java just mallocs a massive pool and then uses that
2011-11-27T18:56:00  <BenJackson> I don't optimize away mallocs at all and it's not hurting me
2011-11-27T18:56:07  <BenJackson> I use std::vector with abandon
2011-11-27T18:56:22  <thestinger> same with me :)
2011-11-27T18:56:23  <BenJackson> ok, I do optimize them away a bit by re-using some things turn to turn
2011-11-27T18:56:31  <BenJackson> but I do create a shitton of vectors
2011-11-27T18:56:53  <thestinger> my pathfinding code only allocates when it pushes stuff onto a std::queue though
2011-11-27T18:57:00  <BenJackson> I really did end up using that vector<pair<vector<Location>,vector<Location>>>
2011-11-27T18:57:06  <thestinger> most of my vectors are allocated once at the start and reused

2011-11-27T18:57:47  <BenJackson> the funny thing is that I balked at using that vector

2011-11-27T18:59:06  <thestinger> I want to finish this combat code :)
2011-11-27T18:59:39  <Minthos> I don't know how std::queue is implemented, but the priority queue I wrote is backed by a dynamic array and I got a huge performance boost by preallocating the array to hold a few thousand nodes
2011-11-27T19:00:02  <thestinger> std::queue is a FIFO
2011-11-27T19:00:10  <thestinger> I bet it's just a linked list
2011-11-27T19:00:24  <Minthos> well profile it anyway
2011-11-27T19:00:32  <Minthos> it's the best way to find out what's going on
2011-11-27T19:00:33  <thestinger> it's fast enough :)
2011-11-27T19:00:55  <thestinger> I can stick 7000 targets into a distance map in way under 1ms
2011-11-27T19:01:17  <Minthos> ah I mean fluxid should profile his
2011-11-27T19:01:32  <AntDroid> my suicidal bot with crappy battle code gets lucky here: http://tcpants.com/replay.8545
2011-11-27T19:01:53  <thestinger> lol, I actually hate that map
2011-11-27T19:02:08  <thestinger> I hate random walks :(
2011-11-27T19:02:48  <thestinger> I guess bots with symmetry detection could do really well on random walks, because you can rush a hill
2011-11-27T19:02:57  <thestinger> but for me, it's just luck
2011-11-27T19:02:58  <AntDroid> i hate random walk too especially my hill defense is not that great.
2011-11-27T19:03:06  <Minthos> I hate that my bot isn't super awesome
2011-11-27T19:03:16  <thestinger> hill defense won't help on a random walk imo, at least until turn 100+
2011-11-27T19:03:27  <thestinger> if someone actually finds your hill really fast, you're probably screwed
2011-11-27T19:03:57  <thestinger> after the initial rushes, it definitely helps
2011-11-27T19:04:28  <Minthos> if your bot is suicidal about attacking yes
2011-11-27T19:04:52  <Minthos> if it just chills out keeping ants away from its territory it doesn't matter much
2011-11-27T19:05:09  <thestinger> then you're screwed on a random walk anyway :P

2011-11-27T19:06:40  <thestinger> you can win by just rushing and getting points, because it doesn't matter if you die

2011-11-27T19:08:34  <thestinger> it has horrible movement and no combat
2011-11-27T19:08:41  <thestinger> it just rushes
2011-11-27T19:09:00  <thestinger> and it has half-working foraging so it can sort of sustain itself sometimes
2011-11-27T19:09:25  <thestinger> I haven't reuploaded because my new version will probably be worse, because it's better :)
2011-11-27T19:10:45  <thestinger> tcp is different because all the bots are really good

2011-11-27T19:14:47  <AntDroid> @thestinger: i'm sure if you upload the same bot again it would have a hard time climbing to the top20 again. bots in the top200 right now is much stronger than the time you've uploaded it.
2011-11-27T19:14:48  <contestbot> AntDroid: No!
2011-11-27T19:15:16  <thestinger> AntDroid: it recently dropped down to ~50 and climbed back to 20
2011-11-27T19:15:21  <pairofdice> I'm in the top 200 so they can't be that good
2011-11-27T19:16:09  <thestinger> AntDroid: mu was 85 a few days ago, and now 86
2011-11-27T19:16:48  <thestinger> so if I reuploaded it would climb up to ~30 after ~3 days I think

2011-11-27T22:28:22  <thestinger> it's ridiculous that C++ lets you overload operators but not define your own
2011-11-27T22:28:25  <thestinger> I just don't get it
2011-11-27T22:28:49  <oelewapperke> that's very hard for postfix languages
2011-11-27T22:29:44  <oelewapperke> the only attempts I've ever seen at that had a set predefined overridable operators, with pre-decided precedence, commutativeness and associative rules
2011-11-27T22:30:06  <p_l> oelewapperke: Haskell gets around that by removing operators :)
2011-11-27T22:30:16  <thestinger> yeah, operators are functions
2011-11-27T22:30:17  <oelewapperke> and once you go that route, you might as well make those operators do something ont he privitive types
2011-11-27T22:30:29  <oelewapperke> at which point you're back at square 1, in a language with slightly more operators

2011-11-27T22:34:10  <p_l> that language already looks like a stew of "let's accept anything that comes this way as long as it doesn't break compatibility in spec, but let's accept screwed-up templates that break older code"
2011-11-27T22:34:54  <thestinger> they almost added something like type classes to C++11
2011-11-27T22:35:10  <oelewapperke> thestinger: so why doesn't "let (boem) x y = 2 * x + 3 * y", "2 boem 3" work ?
2011-11-27T22:35:18  <p_l> If not for OpenCV, I wouldn't have touched it again since that time GCC managed to make if(pointer_to_class) into a template hell

2011-11-27T22:36:02  <p_l> apparently, someone got the bright idea to implement ! on pointers to classes with templates
2011-11-27T22:36:19  <mleise> I don't know what all the fuzz about defining your own operators is about ^^. Just call a function.
2011-11-27T22:36:50  <p_l> mleise: well, it's more about C++ missing the point on either side
2011-11-27T22:36:57  <thestinger> std::cout << 5 << std::endl;
2011-11-27T22:37:00  <p_l> sensible languages made it into functions long time ago
2011-11-27T22:37:03  <thestinger> hideous abuse of operator overloading
2011-11-27T22:37:04  <thestinger> 5 ** 2
2011-11-27T22:37:13  <thestinger> can't do that in C++ with gmp, they can only overload operators
2011-11-27T22:37:37  <p_l> also, C++ somehow managed to become the only language I know where you can "overload" "operators" that ended with that being horribly abused
2011-11-27T22:37:54  <thestinger> oelewapperke: they need to be symbols like + * etc.
2011-11-27T22:37:59  <thestinger> <<- <<|
2011-11-27T22:38:15  <oelewapperke> C++ could be so much better if someone would just rewrite the standard library into a more modern syntax

2011-11-27T22:38:29  <oelewapperke> thestinger: so there is special syntax

2011-11-27T22:40:12  <amstan> one thing i don't like is how python doesn't have function overload
2011-11-27T22:40:23  <p_l> thestinger: when it's all "function", it's easier to figure out rather than the horrible operator<<
2011-11-27T22:40:59  <oelewapperke> amstan: that prevents you from wondering about the "now which function does this call" conundrum that you (sometimes) have in C
2011-11-27T22:40:59  <thestinger> amstan: overloading sucks, type classes is the way to go :P
2011-11-27T22:41:13  <thestinger> anyway python does pretty much have function overloading
2011-11-27T22:41:29  <amstan> yes, but you want to do stuff like add(a,b) and add(list)
2011-11-27T22:41:42  <thestinger> you can do that
2011-11-27T22:41:43  <amstan> and you need this ugly code to do it
2011-11-27T22:41:45  <mleise> how do you do multiple constructors without overloading?
2011-11-27T22:42:14  <mleise> In Delphi you have named constructors, but in other languages...?
2011-11-27T22:42:15  <amstan> def add(*args), if len(args)==2 return arg[0]+arg[1] else return sum(args)
2011-11-27T22:42:32  <amstan> it gets more fun when you want to name arguments properly
2011-11-27T22:42:40  <antimatroid1> p_l: blast you!, << is wonderful!
2011-11-27T22:42:55  <amstan> wait.. no.. sum(args[0])
2011-11-27T22:43:14  <thestinger> antimatroid1: chaining I/O is nice, but abusing operator overloading and not letting you handle errors properly isn't nice :P
2011-11-27T22:43:34  <mleise> thestinger: you can check the error bit
2011-11-27T22:43:48  <antimatroid1> you say that like i ever handle errors :P

2011-11-27T22:50:35  <thestinger> the widely used languages got there by being pragmatic and just re-using syntax/concepts from old languages to make them easy to learn

2011-11-27T22:52:39  <p_l> amstan: the reason Lisp is not used more is mainly... bad publicity. And the fact that it doesn't look like or feels like algol
2011-11-27T22:52:51  <thestinger> lisp will be around in 50 years
2011-11-27T22:52:59  <thestinger> look at perl and awk
2011-11-27T22:53:04  <thestinger> python, ruby, etc. will be the same in 10 years imo
2011-11-27T22:53:16  <thestinger> python can't break backwards compatibility over and over to stay modern
2011-11-27T22:54:19  <thestinger> why learn perl 6 when you can learn python?
2011-11-27T22:54:39  <thestinger> why port code to python4 when a new, much shinier and nicer language exists?
2011-11-27T22:54:52  <thestinger> lisp has been around longer than C :P
2011-11-27T22:56:09  <mleise> thestinger: as a side note, gcc and LLVM actually use the dmd front-end with modifications. So you get the same level of hints/warnings and compile-time features there.
2011-11-27T22:56:47  <thestinger> can I fetch a web page in D with the standard library?

2011-11-27T23:04:51  <thestinger> and there's cabal2arch which just turns any cabal package into an Arch one :)
2011-11-27T23:04:59  <thestinger> I guess that's why so many libs are packaged...
2011-11-27T23:05:03  <mleise> thestinger: http://freeze.steamwinter.com/D/web/phobos/etc_curl.html <- this is in review and will hit the std lib soonish
2011-11-27T23:05:33  <thestinger> that was just a silly example though
2011-11-27T23:05:43  <thestinger> haskell and D mostly just have language features in the standard lib
2011-11-27T23:05:45  <thestinger> not practical stuff
2011-11-27T23:06:09  <thestinger> http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/ I mean this is why I use python
2011-11-27T23:06:13  <thestinger> not because I like the language
2011-11-27T23:06:19  <p_l> and CL's standard lib is frozen, with few semi-standard extensions (that are normalized with few popular libs)
2011-11-27T23:08:14  <mleise> thestinger: you are right. it is understood, but the lack of consense and man power led to the std lib D has now. The same is true for a few other languages.
2011-11-27T23:08:31  <thestinger> that's why I linked the Go standard lib
2011-11-27T23:08:43  <thestinger> it's super new and basically has like 3 devs working part time on it
2011-11-27T23:09:39  <thestinger> but you can make an http server in one line without a library, etc.
2011-11-27T23:10:43  <mleise> yes, it has all the stuff that is asked for in the news groups from time to time. most of that actually exist (for example a fast cgi impl.), but has to be searched for on the net.
2011-11-27T23:11:11  <thestinger> it's different when it's a third party lib
2011-11-27T23:11:21  <thestinger> standard libraries are usually very consistent, and the documentation is great
2011-11-27T23:12:02  <thestinger> and the docs are ofc all in one place
2011-11-27T23:12:14  <jcdny> "great" is a bit of a stretch.
2011-11-27T23:13:02  <thestinger> well, python's docs are great :)
2011-11-27T23:13:03  <jcdny> godoc is nice though
2011-11-27T23:13:04  <mleise> A web server is not something you write every day. I think it doesn't need to be in the std lib just to have it all in one place
2011-11-27T23:13:16  <thestinger> go has a long way to go before the docs are nice
2011-11-27T23:13:54  <thestinger> mleise: xml, sql, csv, image encoding/decoding, etc.
2011-11-27T23:13:58  <thestinger> json
2011-11-27T23:15:22  <thestinger> json-c, json-glib, qjson, jansson, yajl are all libs in the Arch repos for json in C/C++ :P
2011-11-27T23:16:24  <thestinger> if I want to contribute to a python program using json, I won't have to learn the API for the json lib

2011-11-27T23:17:15  <mleise> sql is worked on, csv is in review, image decoding is missing. There are std.json and std.xml. See also: https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/deimos for C bindings. Arch repos or a language specific package manager are a matter of preferrence I think.

2011-11-27T23:18:21  <mleise> I'll be fair, most of what you want isn't there yet or in a bad condition. But it is not because people don't see that it is needed.
2011-11-27T23:19:35  <thestinger> that's why people use perl/ruby/python though imo
2011-11-27T23:19:56  <thestinger> including everything under the sun in the standard lib might not be a good idea, but it gets people to use the language
2011-11-27T23:20:38  <mleise> yeah it makes powerfull scripting possible
2011-11-27T23:20:53  <thestinger> if you rely on a third party to a lib there are lots of consequences, like relying on them to update it
2011-11-27T23:20:58  <thestinger> for a lib*
2011-11-27T23:21:23  <thestinger> like all the third party python libs that aren't ported to py3 yet
2011-11-27T23:21:48  <Antimony> like PIL
2011-11-27T23:21:59  <thestinger> scipy and twisted
2011-11-27T23:22:01  <Antimony> Has PIL even been ported to 2.7 yet?
2011-11-27T23:22:03  <mleise> on the other hand you are better of not maintaining 10000 features in the std lib with a hand full of volunteers
2011-11-27T23:22:29  <thestinger> mleise: yeah, but if people are maintaining a third party library they could be maintaining it in the standard library
2011-11-27T23:22:39  <thestinger> I think that's how python's standard lib has grown
2011-11-27T23:22:59  <thestinger> once it's standard, more people will use it and then more people will develop it

2011-11-27T23:23:38  <thestinger> I meant standard library stuff
2011-11-27T23:23:45  <thestinger> a lot of that just uses C libs though
2011-11-27T23:24:01  <thestinger> like zlib, sqlite, etc.
2011-11-27T23:24:08  <mleise> it is faster anyway ;)
2011-11-27T23:24:21  <thestinger> with cpython it is
2011-11-27T23:25:25  <mleise> you forgot to mention container classes btw in you list
2011-11-27T23:26:01  <thestinger> that's an area where Go sucks, because they don't have nice polymorphism

2011-11-27T23:28:01  <thestinger> doesn't D have templates?
2011-11-27T23:28:15  <thestinger> Go doesn't have static polymorphism
2011-11-27T23:28:30  <thestinger> it has something like duck typing, but only for types you define

2011-11-27T23:35:30  <thestinger> it will be nicer than D imo
2011-11-27T23:35:47  <thestinger> and Mozilla actually makes software people use, so it will actually get used
2011-11-27T23:37:11  <thestinger> at least their own software projects xD

2011-11-27T23:38:09  <thestinger> it doesn't anymore
2011-11-27T23:38:24  <thestinger> it uses much lower memory than chrome per tab

2011-11-27T23:39:18  <thestinger> firefox 3 used a LOT of memory
2011-11-27T23:39:28  <thestinger> firefox 4 had a completely new js engine, so there were lots of leaks
2011-11-27T23:40:27  <thestinger> firefox just has a slow UI, it renders pages and runs javascript as fast as chrome
2011-11-27T23:40:39  <thestinger> that's what you get when you implement your UI in XML and javascript
2011-11-27T23:41:22  <p_l> thestinger: Chrome implements its own UI in HTML+JS
2011-11-27T23:41:35  <p_l> except it has much smaller UI to cover
2011-11-27T23:41:38  <thestinger> running in a different process though
2011-11-27T23:41:50  <mleise> "A lot of thing that are statements in C are expressions in Rust. This allows for useless things" - lol
2011-11-27T23:42:02  <thestinger> firefox has 1 thread for JS iirc
2011-11-27T23:42:20  <p_l> thestinger: actually it's multithreaded
2011-11-27T23:42:49  <p_l> afaik by default two concurrent at once, modifiable through about:config, if I understood it correctly
2011-11-27T23:42:58  <thestinger> ah
2011-11-27T23:43:05  <thestinger> but it's still not separated yet
2011-11-27T23:43:10  <mleise> of course not for one and the same tab

2011-11-27T23:43:54  <thestinger> the UI will freeze until firefox shows a message asking if you want to kill the script
2011-11-27T23:44:19  <mleise> thestinger: when I wrote the visualizer I had a lot of those ^^
2011-11-27T23:44:24  <p_l> thestinger: Usually running a crazy JS loop in ffx means to me "hmm, it got slower, but still works", while I get tab freezing up in Chrome
2011-11-27T23:44:47  <thestinger> yeah chrome has UI in a separate process (along with each tab)
2011-11-27T23:45:08  <thestinger> webkit can now do a process for the UI and one for content iirc
2011-11-27T23:45:16  <bhasker`> chrome is multi process
2011-11-27T23:45:20  <bhasker`> each tab is a separate process
2011-11-27T23:45:24  <mleise> Oo
2011-11-27T23:45:34  <mleise> why not a thread

2011-11-27T23:45:56  <bhasker`> flash can't crash the browser
2011-11-27T23:46:01  <bhasker`> only the active tab
2011-11-27T23:46:06  <thestinger> that's why chrome can't properly use your GTK theme/engine and font settings on linux
2011-11-27T23:46:07  <amstan> chromium has a task manager actually
2011-11-27T23:46:10  <mleise> flash is the reason for too many workarounds imo ^^
2011-11-27T23:46:13  <amstan> i can use it to kill flash
2011-11-27T23:46:24  <thestinger> flash is in a separate process in firefox now too
2011-11-27T23:46:30  <thestinger> same with google talk plugin etc.
2011-11-27T23:46:32  <amstan> thestinger: works for me, with the theme
2011-11-27T23:46:41  <thestinger> amstan: look at the scrollbars
2011-11-27T23:46:43  <thestinger> and checkboxes
2011-11-27T23:46:47  <thestinger> it just copies the colors
2011-11-27T23:46:53  <p_l> bhasker`: their multi-process separation also meant that for a long time, a runaway JS loop wouldn't ground the browser, it would kill the system
2011-11-27T23:46:54  <thestinger> it doesn't use the GTK engine
2011-11-27T23:47:01  <p_l> becaus there was *no* resource management
2011-11-27T23:47:08  <mleise> thestinger: the point is that the plugins crashin in one tab, don't crash content in other tabs i think
2011-11-27T23:47:14  <amstan> thestinger: copies everything for me
2011-11-27T23:47:24  <amstan> thestinger: it's all dark and stuff like my theme

2011-11-27T23:47:54  <amstan> you're right

2011-11-27T23:48:03  <p_l> bhasker`: having loadavg a multiple of available cpus can ground the OS to death in practice
2011-11-27T23:48:03  <thestinger> yeah, it's just a hack
2011-11-27T23:48:07  <thestinger> they read the colors from the theme

2011-11-27T23:48:20  <thestinger> chromium also uses ffmpeg, fontconfig, freetype etc.
2011-11-27T23:48:22  <p_l> bhasker`: especially when there's *zero* i/o
2011-11-27T23:48:26  <thestinger> but it can't be dynamically linked against them

2011-11-27T23:48:38  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-27T23:48:45  <thestinger> they copy the colors properly
2011-11-27T23:48:55  <thestinger> it probably looks good with default themes on ubuntu
2011-11-27T23:49:03  <bhasker`> there shouldn't be a load average of multiple cpu's unless you are running the same JS in multiple tabs
2011-11-27T23:49:14  <amstan> thestinger: the gtk theme that i'm using is also fake, since it copies the kde theme
2011-11-27T23:49:21  <bhasker`> a single tab can't really be worse than a single process runaway JS in firefox
2011-11-27T23:49:23  <thestinger> amstan: the thing that gets me is that it doesn't use fontconfig settings
2011-11-27T23:49:25  <amstan> so that's 2 levels of redirection, and it's still nice
2011-11-27T23:49:47  <thestinger> I use the infinality patches for freetype2, so it also has fonts that are ugly

2011-11-27T23:57:31  <bhasker`> 4.x and since then they release new versions every 2-3 weeks
2011-11-27T23:57:41  <bhasker`> so haven't bothered and i usually use the dev channel chrome
2011-11-27T23:57:42  <thestinger> 4.x was terrible
2011-11-27T23:57:53  <bhasker`> yea
2011-11-27T23:57:56  <thestinger> they have the same 6-week release cycle as chrome now
2011-11-27T23:58:05  <thestinger> well, 4.x was like a year late and they rushed it out near the end
2011-11-27T23:58:27  <bhasker`> btw any of you guys using pledge algorithm for maze line maps?
2011-11-27T23:58:30  <bhasker`> maze like?
2011-11-27T23:58:56  <thestinger> Antimony: try hardcoding hill locations for a specific map and see if you actually gain any benefit from knowing where they are
2011-11-27T23:58:57  <amstan> anyway.. back to ants then
2011-11-27T23:59:01  <thestinger> I don't on sane maps
2011-11-27T23:59:34  <Antimony> No, my bot can deduce locatiosn but doens't seem to gain any benefit to it
2011-11-27T23:59:53  <thestinger> yeah, that's what I mean
2011-11-27T23:59:55  <p_l> bhasker`: Chrome's networking code, however, seems to utterly suck. At least that's one of my guesses regarding why it locks up all the time
