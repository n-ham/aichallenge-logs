2010-10-29T03:52:07  <antimatroid> alright, i'm curious about how you guys are storing the ships at neutral planets, as the way i originally set doesn't actually work properly
2010-10-29T03:52:29  <antimatroid> do you store the amount to take a ship and the "ships" at a planet at a point in time as two different things?
2010-10-29T03:53:13  <antimatroid> i had it stored as one, and then added information about ships at other planets for extra amounts to send, but then if they have fleets arriving at a neutral without taking it inside the distance you could get there, the calculation is very very wrong
2010-10-29T03:56:40  <antimatroid> anyone...
2010-10-29T04:01:26  <antimatroid> oh god, i just realised anothed huge bug with move selection aha

2010-10-29T04:38:16  <lavalamp_> antimatroid: you need to store that separately
2010-10-29T04:38:32  <antimatroid> yeah, bugger, more data to store/copy everywhere
2010-10-29T04:39:52  <lavalamp_> I keep arriving/departing/waiting (will arrive in the future)/held (part of some order) per planet per turn. Also (obviously) ship count and owner, but those are calculated from the others.
2010-10-29T04:41:01  <antimatroid> i just had future planets with ships, unusedShips, and incoming/outgoing fleets

2010-10-29T04:45:56  <Error323> its probably the slowness of server #0
2010-10-29T04:46:15  <lavalamp_> doh
2010-10-29T04:46:25  <antimatroid> dunno, i just found a terrible bug in my code before that might cause the crashing
2010-10-29T04:46:48  <lavalamp_> it'd be nice if they narrowed that down for you...
2010-10-29T04:46:59  <antimatroid> basically, when picking moves, my bot was potentially making negative moves
2010-10-29T04:47:36  <antimatroid> but i don't think it would have executed them, so probably shouldn't cause crashing, hmmm
2010-10-29T04:48:33  <antimatroid> i'm a bit surprised my bot even worked aha

2010-10-29T11:14:14  <lavalamp__> I'm not sure, it really depends on how long it takes to get my eval function working
2010-10-29T11:15:05  <lavalamp__> everything is working pretty well, it's just not optimizing for conditions that will let it win

2010-10-29T11:15:37  <demerzel_> are you using payoff matrix?  there's a lot of possibilities
2010-10-29T11:15:51  <demerzel_> i have used zero game theory concepts just pure math x > y
2010-10-29T11:16:07  <demerzel_> might need to step it up lol
2010-10-29T11:16:12  <lavalamp__> yes I have a payoff matrix
2010-10-29T11:16:30  <demerzel_> based on what
2010-10-29T11:16:35  <lavalamp__> atm it plays a series of tournamentns between different goals to find the best one
2010-10-29T11:17:08  <lavalamp__> If I had more than a second it would do multiple ply but there's no way with this time limit
2010-10-29T11:17:44  <demerzel_> it's totally possible i think
2010-10-29T11:18:06  <demerzel_> my first bot ran every possible source/dest from 1 - numships before every move
2010-10-29T11:18:09  <demerzel_> and it was in c#
2010-10-29T11:18:16  <demerzel_> if i could do that in C# reliably i'm sure it's possible
2010-10-29T11:18:31  <lavalamp__> well, I will optimize after I get this working, I think I can get my node per second count back up.
2010-10-29T11:18:46  <lavalamp__> my move generator is not cheap at all, though, anymore
2010-10-29T11:18:58  <demerzel_> i am trying to read all this game theory stuff but it's hard to see application in a bunch of formulas
2010-10-29T11:19:13  <lavalamp__> I just go off the diagrams
2010-10-29T11:19:15  <lavalamp__> ;)
2010-10-29T11:19:18  <demerzel_> i am tempted to just stick with 'auto defenses' and reduce supply that way
2010-10-29T11:19:26  <demerzel_> that's what i've been doing thus far
2010-10-29T11:19:34  <phreeza> lavalamp__ have you considered a kind of sparse tree sampling to get more ply?
2010-10-29T11:19:43  <phreeza> thats what i am trying to do
2010-10-29T11:19:47  <phreeza> but its not easy
2010-10-29T11:20:02  <lavalamp__> meaning each ply jumps ahead more than a turn? or something else?
2010-10-29T11:20:52  <phreeza> either that or not looking at every possibility within the ply
2010-10-29T11:21:17  <phreeza> just generate 1000 or so and then consider that ply full and move to the next
2010-10-29T11:21:26  <demerzel_> what is a 'ply' to you?  one turn launches?
2010-10-29T11:21:36  <lavalamp__> one ply for me is a move from each side
2010-10-29T11:21:37  <demerzel_> and are you only considering one source/dest?
2010-10-29T11:21:44  <demerzel_> ah
2010-10-29T11:21:46  <phreeza> my basic idea is to do tree width = log(ply)
2010-10-29T11:22:11  <demerzel_> i am not dealing with formulas honestly - imo all moves can be reduced to 2 values
2010-10-29T11:22:20  <demerzel_> rapidity of payback and overall value
2010-10-29T11:22:27  <lavalamp__> phreeza, my move generator makes a few goals and I calculate a few different implementations of them
2010-10-29T11:22:36  <demerzel_> 999999/ log(ships) blahblahblah just complicates it
2010-10-29T11:22:38  <phreeza> ah ok

2010-10-29T11:23:50  <demerzel_> well i'm still playing with it  - but i had a short estimator on whether this was going to 200 or not
2010-10-29T11:24:05  <lavalamp__> debugging my eval function has led me to do some cool logging: http://pastebin.com/L7Tzcy8Y
2010-10-29T11:24:06  <demerzel_> if not i used a forecast of 20 + turns remaining/10
2010-10-29T11:25:00  <demerzel_> my current bot is bugged in that it pauses for incoming but it's purely deterministic in value calculations
2010-10-29T11:25:14  <lavalamp__> how high did your last bot get? that's similar to what I was doing but I think it has limitations
2010-10-29T11:25:28  <demerzel_> oh it's at 176 now with bug
2010-10-29T11:25:34  <demerzel_> and 9-12 random C# crashes

2010-10-29T11:26:59  <demerzel_> the limitations are that it can't possibly calculate defense that way
2010-10-29T11:27:06  <demerzel_> i just auto-calc what is necessary and then reduce supply
2010-10-29T11:27:09  <lavalamp__> ok mine does about the same
2010-10-29T11:27:42  <lavalamp__> yeah I need to add a goal of reducing the enemy's supply
2010-10-29T11:27:52  <demerzel_> after seeing mega implement what i wanted (forecasted launches) i am doing the same in c++ now
2010-10-29T11:27:59  <lavalamp__> when I'm ahead
2010-10-29T11:28:06  <demerzel_> nice thing about c++ is i don't have to think about optimizing ahead of time like i did in c#
2010-10-29T11:28:07  <lavalamp__> forecasted launches?
2010-10-29T11:28:16  <demerzel_> yea watch his games he's got an order buffer
2010-10-29T11:28:24  <demerzel_> like he'll launch 6 ships at p1 on turn 2
2010-10-29T11:28:35  <demerzel_> follow it up with 12 more from a neutral he conquered on turn 6
2010-10-29T11:28:46  <lavalamp__> oh, yeah, I do that too

2010-10-29T11:30:27  <demerzel_> like they're not always pure payback even with other planets forecasted
2010-10-29T11:30:45  <demerzel_> accoun has a faster overall payback system for example
2010-10-29T11:31:29  <lavalamp__> yeah I think there are more important things than pure payback
2010-10-29T11:31:42  <demerzel_> initially i would disagree
2010-10-29T11:32:01  <demerzel_> but i'm not sure how to know when to make the transition

2010-10-29T11:50:15  <demerzel_> or started as at least
2010-10-29T11:50:19  <lavalamp__> so do my coworkers... :/
2010-10-29T11:50:37  <demerzel_> i hate every time i look up sscanf there's 20 posts about WTF DUDE USE STREAMS THATS WHAT C++ IS MAN
2010-10-29T11:51:10  <demerzel_> or every time i look up arrays etc WTF DUDE USE VECTORS THATS WHAT C++ IS MAN
2010-10-29T11:51:17  <lavalamp__> I also find the ANSI file manipulation stuff much more convienient
2010-10-29T11:51:53  <lavalamp__> ...but vectors are better than arrays for many, many things
2010-10-29T11:52:14  <antimatroid> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=766613
2010-10-29T11:52:15  <antimatroid> wtf
2010-10-29T11:52:31  <demerzel_> vectors are nice but if i wanted vectors i'd use them
2010-10-29T11:52:40  <antimatroid> ever seen ship graph like that?
2010-10-29T11:52:56  <demerzel_> it's like List<T> in C# - i don't use it unless i really don't know the length, which is rare
2010-10-29T11:53:10  <lavalamp__> whoa that is an awesome graph
2010-10-29T11:53:35  <antimatroid> it's almost perfect
2010-10-29T11:53:54  <antimatroid> oh yeah, new heuristic bot is up
2010-10-29T11:54:03  <lavalamp__> interesting, h is implementing my ship draining code that I haven't written yet
2010-10-29T11:54:07  <antimatroid> i'll start feeding it into the better stuff once i've cleaned it a bit more
2010-10-29T11:54:13  <JamesMG> holy crap that's awesome
2010-10-29T11:54:55  <antimatroid> do you like my finish :P
2010-10-29T11:55:11  <JamesMG> yeah, one of those games than another 50 turns would've made more entertaining
2010-10-29T11:55:19  <antimatroid> i'm not sure how it knew it was safe to do that without the tree's or game matrices
2010-10-29T11:55:32  <antimatroid> not really, i was about to go in and take him out
2010-10-29T11:55:38  <demerzel_> somebody was doing that - was it flavor or monty?  where basically if they were ahead they'd just neutralize growth on all planets
2010-10-29T11:55:44  <demerzel_> i tried it out but it's hard to get that far ahead
2010-10-29T11:55:50  <demerzel_> without just destroying them anyway
2010-10-29T11:56:14  <antimatroid> i have a different method, any unused ships each turn i redistrbute
2010-10-29T11:56:24  <antimatroid> if i have no planets of mine to redistribute to, spam the closest enemy
2010-10-29T11:59:07  <demerzel_> to what end though?  there's no advantage in doing that
2010-10-29T11:59:17  <antimatroid> i have no use for the ships
2010-10-29T11:59:21  <demerzel_> if you both have 200 or 1200 it's actually more advantageous to hold the 1200
2010-10-29T11:59:28  <antimatroid> bear in mind i am making future moves at each turn
2010-10-29T11:59:35  <antimatroid> and reserving ships necessary to make them
2010-10-29T11:59:40  <demerzel_> because if they launch their 1200 in a stupid or at least exploitable way having more is better
2010-10-29T12:00:15  <antimatroid> it's doing much better than i expected given it's entirely heuristic based right now

2010-10-29T12:10:14  <antimatroid> it has a terrible hack in there cause it's using heuristics only
2010-10-29T12:10:32  <antimatroid> it should do better once i throw it into different types of games and consider what the enemy can do as well

2010-10-29T12:19:56  <demerzel_> nice
2010-10-29T12:20:00  <lavalamp__> what about this requires bit shifting?
2010-10-29T12:20:06  <demerzel_> i am a little worried about planets not actually counting 23
2010-10-29T12:20:09  <demerzel_> i sorta rely on that
2010-10-29T12:20:17  <lavalamp__> demerzel_, me too
2010-10-29T12:20:28  <demerzel_> i totally rely on it actually
2010-10-29T12:20:34  <lavalamp__> well, I'd be ok if there were fewer than 23
2010-10-29T12:20:35  <demerzel_> my update function increments to 23 and back to 0
2010-10-29T12:20:44  <lavalamp__> I think
2010-10-29T12:21:30  <antimatroid> i couldn't handle more than 40 or so i don't think

2010-10-29T12:22:48  <demerzel_> i have found the more complex i try to make my eval the more problems it has
2010-10-29T12:26:17  <raedwulf> ea my bit function relies on 256 planets
2010-10-29T12:26:23  <raedwulf> max
2010-10-29T12:26:25  <raedwulf> :P
2010-10-29T12:26:26  <lavalamp__> I can't imagine why more complexity would add more bugs
2010-10-29T12:26:58  <raedwulf> if the code has fixed sized structures....
2010-10-29T12:26:59  <JamesMG> I have found that the more time I spend on my bots the worse they do
2010-10-29T12:27:06  <raedwulf> lol
2010-10-29T12:28:14  <raedwulf> also, if your evaluation algorithm has something O(exp(n)) complexity with n = number of planets
2010-10-29T12:28:20  <raedwulf> i can see why more planets=more headache
2010-10-29T12:28:22  <raedwulf> lol
2010-10-29T12:28:55  <raedwulf> the number of planets is directly proportional to the amount of headache
2010-10-29T12:28:59  <lavalamp__> I think my engine as a whole is probably at least O(n^4)
2010-10-29T12:29:13  <demerzel_> i can't see a useful eval with log/cos/sin anything honestly it's just a disconnected number at that point
2010-10-29T12:29:54  <JamesMG> I don't think I'm doing any O(exp(n)) anymore, I did used to have an O(exp(n)) for n = fleet count though...
2010-10-29T12:29:56  <JamesMG> that was exciting.
2010-10-29T12:30:39  <lavalamp__> oh, my goal optimization algorithm is O(n!)
2010-10-29T12:31:00  <lavalamp__> ...I don't let that one run to completion...
2010-10-29T12:31:13  <lavalamp__> actually right now it's off completely

2010-10-29T12:37:01  <antimatroid> that doesn't even make sense
2010-10-29T12:37:18  <antimatroid> i remove the declaration of a 3d vector that is not used from game state and my bot crashes
2010-10-29T12:39:27  <antimatroid> lol, i don't even know how to debug that
2010-10-29T12:39:42  <raedwulf> antimatroid: evilness
2010-10-29T12:40:11  <raedwulf> antimatroid: there's a reason for that, you're overflowing your stack
2010-10-29T12:40:19  <raedwulf> most probably
2010-10-29T12:40:49  <antimatroid> how would changing the definiton of something cause that?
2010-10-29T12:41:42  <raedwulf> variables take space up in the stack, if some other variable beside it overflows, it could induce crashes - but the crashes were prevented because they were stuffing things into that vector
2010-10-29T12:42:11  <raedwulf> usually the compiler removes such definitions as they don't appear to be used, however
2010-10-29T12:42:16  <raedwulf> is this vector a stl vector?
2010-10-29T12:42:28  <raedwulf> or just a struct
2010-10-29T12:42:48  <raedwulf> as in a mathematical vector
2010-10-29T12:42:48  <antimatroid> it's a 3d vector of ints inside a struct
2010-10-29T12:42:53  <raedwulf> ok
2010-10-29T12:42:58  <antimatroid> stl vectors
2010-10-29T12:42:58  <demerzel_> ew
2010-10-29T12:43:00  <demerzel_> why 3d
2010-10-29T12:43:07  <antimatroid> i have many of them
2010-10-29T12:43:14  <raedwulf> do you have any nearby fixed sized arrays?
2010-10-29T12:43:19  <antimatroid> [planet][time][player]
2010-10-29T12:43:40  <raedwulf> there you go
2010-10-29T12:43:54  <raedwulf> if that overflows, it fills into your struct (that appears unused)
2010-10-29T12:44:06  <raedwulf> maybe you're off by one or something
2010-10-29T12:44:18  <antimatroid> hmm, i'll have a poke around
2010-10-29T12:44:29  <raedwulf> its usually the case anyway
2010-10-29T12:44:36  <raedwulf> if you have other weird memory bugs, it could happen
2010-10-29T12:44:58  <phreeza> you can use valgrind to debug that kind of shit
2010-10-29T12:45:00  <phreeza> sometimes
2010-10-29T12:45:23  <phreeza> but raedwulf analysis sounds good to me
2010-10-29T12:46:00  <phreeza> also you can use at() instead of operator[], that makes sure you don't overflow
2010-10-29T12:46:29  <raedwulf> yea, valgrind has a tendency to only deal with allocations though - if its fixed sized it might not find it
2010-10-29T12:46:50  <raedwulf> i.e. whether the memory is allocated on the stack or on the heap
2010-10-29T12:46:59  <raedwulf> heap? (maybe im wrong here)

2010-10-29T12:47:33  <raedwulf> for*
2010-10-29T12:47:35  <phreeza> isn't the content of a vector always on the heap?
2010-10-29T12:47:52  <phreeza> the vector itself might be on the stack but it contains a vector to the heap
2010-10-29T12:47:54  <raedwulf> im not sure, i think it depends on implementation
2010-10-29T12:48:00  <phreeza> but i might be completely wrong
2010-10-29T12:48:01  <phreeza> yea
2010-10-29T12:48:23  <raedwulf> if he uses a "new" i think its always on heap
2010-10-29T12:48:53  <phreeza> isn't that what vector does internally?

2010-10-29T12:52:11  <lavalamp__> yes vector does new internally
2010-10-29T12:52:22  <lavalamp__> vector op [] should do bounds checking
2010-10-29T12:52:51  <raedwulf> maybe he's using simple arrays
2010-10-29T12:52:53  <phreeza> i'm pretty sure it doesn't
2010-10-29T12:52:59  <phreeza> at() does
2010-10-29T12:53:09  <phreeza> at least in the implementation i use
2010-10-29T12:53:50  <phreeza> and that causes nasty errors because depending on your compile flags, vector pads its contents, so you can go out of bounds without segfaulting

2010-10-29T13:26:13  <demerzel_> i also calc maximum fleet possibility to any planet on any turn
2010-10-29T13:26:27  <demerzel_> which i need to figure out how not to always use ;)
2010-10-29T13:26:44  <demerzel_> you are using an order buffer though which i implemented and never used

2010-10-29T13:27:29  <demerzel_> it seems you do linear expansion but i'm not sure if you're using distance or a minimax 'if i own this on turn 3 i can own that on turn 9'
2010-10-29T13:27:34  <demerzel_> can't figure out your pattern haha
2010-10-29T13:30:10  <lavalamp__> janzert! You're back!
2010-10-29T13:30:38  <janzert> yes! :)
2010-10-29T13:31:16  <antimatroid> mega1: i'm coming after you sir
2010-10-29T13:31:17  <lavalamp__> did you see the script I wrote for you?
2010-10-29T13:31:24  <demerzel_> mega1: i am currently trying to abstract all parts of  the actual ships involved and looking at moves as solely capture/loss
2010-10-29T13:31:26  <janzert> I see you got golang integrated into the setup script. Still catching up on a bunch of stuff but I'll look at it as soon as I can
2010-10-29T13:31:30  <demerzel_> which is incredibly hard
2010-10-29T13:31:32  <mega1> antimatroid: have you found so many bugs?
2010-10-29T13:31:37  <antimatroid> yep
2010-10-29T13:31:53  <antimatroid> and i have a new implementation to try soonish
2010-10-29T13:31:56  <antimatroid> possibly not tonight though
2010-10-29T13:32:02  <mega1> that's where most of my improvements came from, too
2010-10-29T13:32:13  <antimatroid> i found soo many bugs fundamentally :P
2010-10-29T13:32:16  <demerzel_> what is?
2010-10-29T13:32:21  <demerzel_> bugs?
2010-10-29T13:32:50  <antimatroid> so bad in fact i was potentially sending back moves with negative fleets that would then be ignored
2010-10-29T13:33:01  <lavalamp__> janzert, if you have any troubles with it let me know...
2010-10-29T13:36:01  <janzert> don't worry I  will :)

2010-10-29T14:06:22  <antimatroid> Zannick: clearly they're not too trivial for everyone yet
2010-10-29T14:06:55  <Zannick> overlapping planets?
2010-10-29T14:07:03  <Zannick> planets with distance 1?
2010-10-29T14:07:08  <antimatroid> oh, you want a better visualiser?
2010-10-29T14:07:16  <antimatroid> oh meh, i want planets with distance one
2010-10-29T14:07:17  <Zannick> that was a bug that was fixed
2010-10-29T14:07:21  <antimatroid> i don't know why people don't
2010-10-29T14:07:26  <demerzel_> are they 1?
2010-10-29T14:07:33  <demerzel_> whats a better visualizer
2010-10-29T14:07:40  <Zannick> it was a matter of the generator not applying the too_close check to the starting planets
2010-10-29T14:07:46  <antimatroid> one that displays the planets not overlapping
2010-10-29T14:07:48  <Zannick> planets can be 1 apart
2010-10-29T14:08:15  <Zannick> but unfortunately you can't do that since with the old code the starting planets could be arbitrarily close

2010-10-29T14:08:55  <antimatroid> have we got any maps yet that aren't symmetric 50 50
2010-10-29T14:09:08  <antimatroid> like split it into thirds, and have a player start on one of the thirds
2010-10-29T14:09:10  <demerzel_> they are generated that way
2010-10-29T14:09:16  <demerzel_> with 0 being in the dead center
2010-10-29T14:09:22  <antimatroid> that's boring
2010-10-29T14:09:26  <demerzel_> i guess
2010-10-29T14:09:31  <antimatroid> other maps would much more favour expansion
2010-10-29T14:09:34  <antimatroid> i think
2010-10-29T14:09:44  <demerzel_> really all it is now is superior expansion at start
2010-10-29T14:09:45  <antimatroid> depends how good the planets are at a distance
2010-10-29T14:09:55  <demerzel_> but there is a max best way to expand and if the other guy does the same then it's state keeping
2010-10-29T14:10:06  <antimatroid> no it's not, my bot does half decently and it's starting move always sucks
2010-10-29T14:10:08  <demerzel_> then if he keeps state as well as you then it's just sitting and waiting till turn 200
2010-10-29T14:10:47  <demerzel_> plugging in all my billions of state shit in c++ is taking forever
2010-10-29T14:10:55  <demerzel_> implementing the starting bot was like a couple hours
2010-10-29T14:12:37  <contestbot> Top 10 players: GreenTea(3905), bocsimacko(3846), rsergio(3801), felixcoto(3788), rs5147(3742), dmj111(3726), Accoun(3711), shangas(3704), Hazard(3677), protocolocon(3666)
2010-10-29T14:13:00  <phreeza> demerzel_: I'm not sure there is really a single optimal way to start out
2010-10-29T14:13:10  <phreeza> because of RageBot style openings
2010-10-29T14:13:11  <demerzel_> there is that's why mega1 does so well
2010-10-29T14:13:34  <mega1> eh?
2010-10-29T14:13:36  <demerzel_> well one of several reasons but a major one
2010-10-29T14:13:40  <demerzel_> you expand early extremely well
2010-10-29T14:13:54  <demerzel_> cleanly and seems to have a covering check
2010-10-29T14:14:22  <mega1> ah, I thought that's actually a weak spot
2010-10-29T14:14:35  <demerzel_> no because your expansion targets are covered
2010-10-29T14:14:55  <demerzel_> or i'm not sure exactly what the logic is but you don't just send to the closest best payback/cost:value
2010-10-29T14:15:10  <demerzel_> which works because then you're never in a position where you're overextended
2010-10-29T14:15:51  <mega1> and I got butchered when risk must be taken
2010-10-29T14:16:08  <demerzel_> yea it's tough
2010-10-29T14:16:20  <demerzel_> a true minimax bot would shut down if you didnt' at least match enemy expansion
2010-10-29T14:16:42  <demerzel_> i had one that went all 200-ply and wouldn't do jack if i wasn't at least 1 ahead because it saw all moves as a risk
2010-10-29T14:17:37  <demerzel_> i'm on like recode #5 and still playing with algorithms :(
2010-10-29T14:19:18  <phreeza> how on earth did you go 200 ply
2010-10-29T14:19:29  <phreeza> local, no timeout?
2010-10-29T14:19:32  <demerzel_> i am an optimization freak
2010-10-29T14:19:35  <demerzel_> no
2010-10-29T14:19:51  <demerzel_> my first contest bot was 200-ply
2010-10-29T14:20:09  <demerzel_> and considered every source->dest from 1 ship to how many it had before every move
2010-10-29T14:20:13  <phreeza> wow thats very impressive.... how many nodes per ply?
2010-10-29T14:20:22  <demerzel_> in C# no less
2010-10-29T14:20:30  <phreeza> wow
2010-10-29T14:20:41  <demerzel_> you can do a lot if you optimize
2010-10-29T14:20:46  <demerzel_> people underestimate
2010-10-29T14:20:49  <lavalamp__> I'm having a hard time believing that
2010-10-29T14:20:59  <Zannick> you evaluated 9.41x10^23 possible moves in under 1 sec
2010-10-29T14:21:15  <demerzel_> there aren't that many
2010-10-29T14:21:18  <phreeza> more
2010-10-29T14:21:20  <Zannick> yes there are
2010-10-29T14:21:26  <phreeza> even if there is only a single planet
2010-10-29T14:21:31  <phreeza> 100 ships
2010-10-29T14:21:39  <Zannick> 100 ships, 23 planets, 122 choose 22
2010-10-29T14:21:42  <phreeza> its 100^200 or so
2010-10-29T14:21:47  <demerzel_> ah well what i did was set up a separate class
2010-10-29T14:21:53  <demerzel_> that kept a simulated world
2010-10-29T14:21:55  <Zannick> and that's just on the first turn
2010-10-29T14:22:09  <demerzel_> it updated source/dest turns for scenario x
2010-10-29T14:22:14  <demerzel_> then reset it to 'actual' state
2010-10-29T14:22:17  <demerzel_> kept score
2010-10-29T14:22:32  <Zannick> i think it might have just been exiting early every time
2010-10-29T14:22:36  <demerzel_> no
2010-10-29T14:22:44  <demerzel_> it was close
2010-10-29T14:22:56  <demerzel_> my slowest bot by far but it made 1s it was like ~150
2010-10-29T14:23:12  <Zannick> i would like to see this after the contest
2010-10-29T14:23:18  <lavalamp__> what kind of computer do you have and where can I get one?
2010-10-29T14:23:23  <Zannick> if you really got that far
2010-10-29T14:23:24  <demerzel_> on the contest server :P
2010-10-29T14:24:00  <lavalamp__> you're saying you try every combination of ships from every source planet to every dest planet?
2010-10-29T14:24:20  <demerzel_> i don't any more
2010-10-29T14:24:26  <demerzel_> that was my first attempt at minmax
2010-10-29T14:24:30  <lavalamp__> but you did?
2010-10-29T14:24:46  <demerzel_> every combination of ships from my planets to all planets yes
2010-10-29T14:24:52  <phreeza> how many nodes were there at ply 200? :D
2010-10-29T14:25:03  <phreeza> more than atoms in the universe lol
2010-10-29T14:25:16  <lavalamp__> I will bet you money that you had a bug that causes it to not evaluate every combination
2010-10-29T14:25:17  <demerzel_> it didn't keep nodes it kept best score
2010-10-29T14:25:27  <demerzel_> purely score-based eval
2010-10-29T14:25:42  <Zannick> any pruning? alpha-beta/whatnot?
2010-10-29T14:25:51  <demerzel_> not at first, eventually yes
2010-10-29T14:26:13  <phreeza> this game has a much higher branching factor than go and it can't be done for go
2010-10-29T14:26:14  <demerzel_> i still have the code somewhere i'd post it idc i've recoded twice and am in a completely diff language now
2010-10-29T14:26:53  <demerzel_> basically it had a Holodeck class that allowed me to simulate as many moves as i wanted then record the score, the nreset it
2010-10-29T14:27:10  <demerzel_> if it got a better score it would hold the source/target/fleetsize
2010-10-29T14:27:24  <lavalamp__> are you sure you weren't doing monte carlo? that doesn't sound like minimax
2010-10-29T14:27:28  <Zannick> that is one way one could do minimax, but it is normally not very efficient
2010-10-29T14:27:35  <demerzel_> it's not efficient at all lol
2010-10-29T14:27:44  <Zannick> but it ran in under a second
2010-10-29T14:27:46  <demerzel_> only reason it worked is i am incredibly anal about performance
2010-10-29T14:27:53  <phreeza> so you get to 200ply on a single branch
2010-10-29T14:28:01  <phreeza> or a couple
2010-10-29T14:28:18  <demerzel_> one branch per move, do x then y then z
2010-10-29T14:28:24  <demerzel_> add totals
2010-10-29T14:28:49  <demerzel_> it's a terribly shitty system!  all i am saying is people underestimate what even a shitty modern computer can do was my point
2010-10-29T14:28:55  <Zannick> yeah, if you can't find your source and post it after the contest, we will probably not believe you
2010-10-29T14:29:01  <demerzel_> lol
2010-10-29T14:29:24  <Zannick> since what you're claiming is to have evaluated every possible state
2010-10-29T14:29:25  <lavalamp__> sorry, I don't believe you were exhaustively searching the space
2010-10-29T14:29:31  <demerzel_> i probably wasn't
2010-10-29T14:29:41  <lavalamp__> if you succeeeded your bot would have owned everyone
2010-10-29T14:29:43  <demerzel_> it still did a fuckton of calculations in under a second
2010-10-29T14:30:26  <brx> demerzel_: maybe if you port it to c++ you can solve the entire game. ;)
2010-10-29T14:30:34  <demerzel_> haha i am working on it
2010-10-29T14:30:47  <demerzel_> c++ is strangely freeing
2010-10-29T14:30:56  <demerzel_> i don't have to worry about whether the compiler will do this or how to init it
2010-10-29T14:31:02  <demerzel_> i just /know/
2010-10-29T14:31:09  <phreeza> but your point is probably true anyway...
2010-10-29T14:31:27  <phreeza> a perfect minimax wouldn't do anything on move 0
2010-10-29T14:31:43  <lavalamp__> huh?
2010-10-29T14:31:49  <Zannick> i doubt that
2010-10-29T14:31:52  <demerzel_> no it would
2010-10-29T14:31:58  <demerzel_> it just wouldn't do anything if it was losing
2010-10-29T14:32:07  <lavalamp__> huh?
2010-10-29T14:32:09  <demerzel_> or rather - lock down
2010-10-29T14:32:16  <Zannick> i doubt that, too
2010-10-29T14:32:20  <lavalamp__> minimax selects the best choice even if it is negative
2010-10-29T14:32:29  <demerzel_> yes the choice is inactivity
2010-10-29T14:32:40  <demerzel_> if your state has 'how much enemy can get to me'
2010-10-29T14:32:45  <demerzel_> and also 'how much i can get there'
2010-10-29T14:32:49  <demerzel_> and yours is less than the enemy
2010-10-29T14:32:52  <lavalamp__> why? surely best choice when you are losing is to make as much trouble as possible and hope for a mistake
2010-10-29T14:32:53  <demerzel_> then it won't fire
2010-10-29T14:33:04  <demerzel_> apply that to my planets
2010-10-29T14:33:07  <Zannick> the first one is false because there are maps (eg map1) that have starter planets at distance > 20 so inactivity is strictly worse than taking any neutral
2010-10-29T14:33:09  <demerzel_> every planet is under risk of loss
2010-10-29T14:33:17  <demerzel_> welll excepting weird maps ofc
2010-10-29T14:33:28  <Zannick> lavalamp__: that's not minimax :)
2010-10-29T14:33:38  <phreeza> good point
2010-10-29T14:33:39  <demerzel_> no that's a flaw of minmax actually
2010-10-29T14:33:51  <demerzel_> it assumes the enemy will make the best move every time
2010-10-29T14:34:06  <Zannick> you could redesign some part of the scoring to be better when there are less losing states in the tree
2010-10-29T14:34:12  <demerzel_> my current bot attacks every time with exactly how much is needed to not allow the enemy ot reinforce
2010-10-29T14:34:20  <Zannick> that's a very slight improvement/hope for mistake
2010-10-29T14:34:21  <demerzel_> because it can't make a decision as to whether it's necessary or not
2010-10-29T14:34:28  <lavalamp__> Ah hm maybe you guys are right
2010-10-29T14:34:38  <raedwulf> hope this complexity pays off in the end
2010-10-29T14:35:02  <demerzel_> eh this is fun to me lol
2010-10-29T14:35:28  <lavalamp__> well I do recursive payoff tables and I don't think my bot has that problem... hm
2010-10-29T14:35:55  <demerzel_> your payoff tables are subjective
2010-10-29T14:36:00  <demerzel_> or your state is incomplete
2010-10-29T14:37:07  <lavalamp__> I give each node two scores (mine, theirs)-- I make it maximize its own score
2010-10-29T14:37:43  <lavalamp__> I'm not sure if that counts as subjective but my search is definitely not exhaustive

2010-10-29T14:39:45  <jmcarthur> plain minimax is very bad at "hoping for a mistake"
2010-10-29T14:40:20  <jmcarthur> oh that was basically said already
2010-10-29T14:40:30  * jmcarthur should finish reading a conversation before piping in
2010-10-29T14:40:34  <Zannick> heh
2010-10-29T14:42:01  <lavalamp__> yeah I'm mistaken, I keep getting confused because I'm not doing straight minimax
2010-10-29T14:42:33  <demerzel_> that's actually all i know i am trying to figure out some other concepts
2010-10-29T14:42:40  <demerzel_> either that or i guess i can try to power through it with c++ now lol
2010-10-29T14:42:49  <lavalamp__> hm... in fact I should add code to choose more randomly when behind...
2010-10-29T14:46:59  <JamesMG> lavalamp__: does your scoring function have a component to prioritize targetting the enemy player?
2010-10-29T14:47:18  <JamesMG> [11:40] <lavalamp__> I give each node two scores (mine, theirs)-- I make it maximize its own score
2010-10-29T14:47:21  <JamesMG> that makes it sound like no?

2010-10-29T14:48:21  <lavalamp__> I'm not quite sure
2010-10-29T14:48:28  <JamesMG> oh, haha
2010-10-29T14:48:31  <Zannick> traditional minimax uses one score
2010-10-29T14:48:31  <demerzel_> it would
2010-10-29T14:48:36  <Zannick> mine-theirs, for instance
2010-10-29T14:48:41  <Zannick> so if you did that, it would
2010-10-29T14:48:43  <demerzel_> i just use negative for enemy
2010-10-29T14:48:49  <JamesMG> yeah Zannick, mine does that
2010-10-29T14:48:57  <demerzel_> but that would just be the same thing really, 0 vs 5 = -5
2010-10-29T14:48:59  <JamesMG> mine-thiers > current best mine-thiers
2010-10-29T14:49:13  <lavalamp__> Actually I maximize mine-theres, but if that is 0 I maximize mine
2010-10-29T14:49:26  <lavalamp__> because some 0's are better than others
2010-10-29T14:50:12  <lavalamp__> I started off with just one score for both but it was too hard to add modifiers onto it
2010-10-29T14:50:46  <lavalamp__> and I couldn't make it tell the difference between we both expand and we both do nothing
2010-10-29T14:51:20  <lavalamp__> plus this way is generalizable to > 2 player games
2010-10-29T14:51:30  <lavalamp__> not that that matters in any way
2010-10-29T14:51:47  <JamesMG> I want to try making it adjustable players after the contest

2010-10-29T16:05:39  <lavalamp__> uhh
2010-10-29T16:06:08  <demerzel_> sadly that kind of dev exists
2010-10-29T16:06:34  <demerzel_> that thread with the dude that was asking what to do with .cc files and needed a walkthrough of adding them to a vs project blew my mind
2010-10-29T16:06:58  <lavalamp__> there have been a few c++ threads that have astonished me
2010-10-29T16:07:19  <phreeza> i guess people are using this to learn programming/a new language
2010-10-29T16:07:30  <demerzel_> i barely know c++ i think i last used it when i was like 15
2010-10-29T16:07:55  <demerzel_> amazingly C# is close enough to let me remember most of it
2010-10-29T16:08:11  <demerzel_> initialization of arrays and shit cost me a few hours of google time but otherwise it's pretty smooth - fits my dev style perfectly
2010-10-29T16:08:37  <phreeza> the fact that you need to initialize them cost you hours?
2010-10-29T16:08:43  <phreeza> or the syntax of how to do it
2010-10-29T16:08:53  <demerzel_> well i always research everything beyond just syntax
2010-10-29T16:09:03  <lavalamp__> I always have to google for one thing, the syntax for pointers to member functions
2010-10-29T16:09:14  <lavalamp__> I can never remember
2010-10-29T16:09:15  <phreeza> in c++?
2010-10-29T16:09:19  <demerzel_> init lists then trying to init arrays in them etc
2010-10-29T16:09:27  <demerzel_> why would you want a pointer to member functions?  that sounds dangerous
2010-10-29T16:09:36  <lavalamp__> lol it's not useful very often
2010-10-29T16:09:56  <lavalamp__> actually, not true
2010-10-29T16:09:58  <phreeza> anonymous functions?
2010-10-29T16:10:00  <demerzel_> i do love the shit out of pointers
2010-10-29T16:10:08  <lavalamp__> std::for_each is an example of something that can use that

2010-10-29T16:10:34  <lavalamp__> bind something or other
2010-10-29T16:10:35  <demerzel_> i guess cuz i don't know the c syntax for class/structs or if they're even possible

2010-10-29T16:12:56  <phreeza> for optimization ok
2010-10-29T16:13:04  <lavalamp__> lol they're so hard to work with...

2010-10-29T16:13:17  <demerzel_> they're not that bad
2010-10-29T16:13:25  <demerzel_> i just wish they had a standard pascal option
2010-10-29T16:13:31  <demerzel_> if they carried length they'd be great
2010-10-29T16:13:52  <phreeza> hehe isnt that really what a std::string is
2010-10-29T16:13:57  <lavalamp__> meh all I know is I'm at least twice as fast manipulating go strings
2010-10-29T16:14:00  <phreeza> a c string that knows its length
2010-10-29T16:14:09  <phreeza> and does all the boilerplate allocation for you
2010-10-29T16:14:15  <lavalamp__> std::string isn't too bad

2010-10-29T16:14:50  <demerzel_> no i would use std::string
2010-10-29T16:14:59  <phreeza> no wonder you complain about c++ compile times
2010-10-29T16:15:00  <demerzel_> but i don't believe streams are better than direct mem allocation
2010-10-29T16:15:02  <demerzel_> because theyre not

2010-10-29T16:38:01  <demerzel_> sorry!  tbh tho if i did continue in C# and it kept screwing up i'd probably be pretty pissed at spending a month on something that has no chance in the finals
2010-10-29T16:38:22  <demerzel_> speaking of danielVF does he cache the old games somewhere?  they are cleaned ridiculously quickly
2010-10-29T16:38:24  <amstan> that's what happened last year with java
2010-10-29T16:38:38  <demerzel_> no shit haha
2010-10-29T16:38:48  <demerzel_> well i mean i did code with the fact that it's not binary in mind ie optimization
2010-10-29T16:38:49  <amstan> if you pick these languages you have to keep in mind that there's problems with implementations
2010-10-29T16:38:52  <amstan> and they might not always work
2010-10-29T16:38:54  <demerzel_> but still
2010-10-29T16:38:57  <amstan> it's a risk you have to take
2010-10-29T16:39:01  <demerzel_> i can't help it if the whole thing don't work

2010-10-29T16:39:40  <amstan> C# was not designed to be used like this. C# was made for visual studio, to make apps in windows. Then they ported it to linux to gain more popularity.

2010-10-29T16:41:09  <janzert> it worked until people started using it :P

2010-10-29T16:41:56  <demerzel_> did you see my post on the script to make a parallel ?
2010-10-29T16:42:15  <JamesMG> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=769108
2010-10-29T16:42:18  <JamesMG> I like that map a lot
2010-10-29T16:42:19  <demerzel_> not that it matters to me any more but might be useful
2010-10-29T16:42:27  <janzert> parallel question marks?
2010-10-29T16:42:28  <JamesMG> not so much the way my bot handled it...
2010-10-29T16:42:49  <demerzel_> no a parallel mono deployment for the stable version
2010-10-29T16:42:52  <demerzel_> on ubuntu
2010-10-29T16:43:05  <demerzel_> i say parallel because you would keep the packaged one too
2010-10-29T16:43:14  <demerzel_> since you didn't want to go outside package
2010-10-29T16:43:29  <janzert> ahh, I think I saw it but I don't want to build from scratch if I can help it and most people are happy with 2.4 it seems
2010-10-29T16:44:00  <demerzel_> you don't have to build it from scratch a guy wrote a script to do it for you practically
2010-10-29T16:44:06  <janzert> I wouldn't have any *need* to keep the package one if I had to use the one from scratch
2010-10-29T16:44:26  <janzert> and badgerports has tested packages
2010-10-29T16:44:42  <janzert> just not for 2.6 and ubuntu hardy :)
2010-10-29T16:44:49  <demerzel_> *shrug*
2010-10-29T16:45:04  <demerzel_> doesn't matter to me any more but that's a pretty well-known script ie it's not just some dude on a blog i know it's been used a lot
2010-10-29T16:45:11  <janzert> personally I'm done with C#, if another admin wants to step in and do more it's up to them :/
2010-10-29T16:45:46  <demerzel_> thanks for validating my switch to c++ then haha
2010-10-29T16:45:46  <janzert> but how much with hardy would be the question I think

2010-10-29T16:46:32  <janzert> it was way more trouble than it was worth in my view
2010-10-29T16:46:51  <demerzel_> you're using hardy?  i thought it was just a 9.1 box
2010-10-29T16:46:58  <JamesMG> I'll port to go if you get that working, so I can continue to be a pain in your ass janzert
2010-10-29T16:47:02  <demerzel_> idk then

2010-10-29T16:47:12  <janzert> JamesMG: hehe
2010-10-29T16:47:42  <demerzel_> yank it then haha

2010-10-29T16:51:36  <janzert> not positive what you mean, but if I understand you correctly it shouldn't
2010-10-29T16:51:43  <demerzel_> not sure if it expects a 1:1 .h:.cpp or how it gathers files
2010-10-29T16:51:58  <Zannick> no
2010-10-29T16:52:09  <demerzel_> cool ty
2010-10-29T16:52:10  <Zannick> the compiler basically doesn't care
2010-10-29T16:52:26  <Zannick> you want to know what #include does?
2010-10-29T16:52:28  <janzert> in cpp .h files are inserted textually into the source file before compilation
2010-10-29T16:52:34  <Zannick> pastes the entire thing in
2010-10-29T16:52:52  <Zannick> yeah, the preprocessor does major hax
2010-10-29T16:52:56  <demerzel_> hmm so a universal header file is bad?  i thought that's what include guards prevented
2010-10-29T16:53:03  <Zannick> no, it isn't bad
2010-10-29T16:53:08  <demerzel_> i just got tired of updating similar .h and ordering them precisely
2010-10-29T16:53:32  <demerzel_> i have never used c++ at a job so i don't know standards at all lol
2010-10-29T16:53:36  <Zannick> as long as header files are only declarations, not definitions
2010-10-29T16:53:44  <demerzel_> they'd probably fire me if i tried here haha
2010-10-29T16:54:14  <Zannick> declarations mean yes, this function name/variable is somewhere, so the code file can be compiled
2010-10-29T16:54:26  <demerzel_> yea no i know what they are i just know very little about standards
2010-10-29T16:54:33  <Zannick> then the linker will paste things together so the binary has the referenced thing
2010-10-29T16:54:38  <demerzel_> outside of init lists are good and don't be a dumbass with pointers
2010-10-29T16:54:55  <Zannick> i have a global debug.h that has a bunch of #defines
2010-10-29T16:55:22  <demerzel_> do you ever use forward decs?  i have never seen anyone use them ever i didn't evne know they were possible
2010-10-29T16:56:03  <Zannick> what do you mean?
2010-10-29T16:56:46  <demerzel_> stub declarations basically
2010-10-29T16:56:52  <Zannick> my .h files have forward declarations, that's how that generally is done
2010-10-29T16:57:00  <demerzel_> well no i meant in the actual cpp file
2010-10-29T16:57:17  <Zannick> i used to do that, but instead i just include the header itself
2010-10-29T16:57:26  <demerzel_> ah ok yea i've always done that i just wondered
2010-10-29T16:58:09  <demerzel_> sorry i am in a weird position with c++ - i know programming concepts and the language very well but have no idea on standards and nobody i know knows c++ not even the xkcd types lol
2010-10-29T16:58:30  <JamesMG> haha, "xkcd types"
2010-10-29T16:58:44  <Zannick> i am not perfect on c++ though i use it at work, among others
2010-10-29T16:58:47  <Zannick> i prefer c
2010-10-29T16:59:26  <demerzel_> i like c a lot it was my second language after the original BASIC
2010-10-29T16:59:37  <demerzel_> i still prefer c strings and arrays and basically just use c++ for easier oop

2010-10-29T18:54:35  <McLeopold> are you ready for this?
2010-10-29T18:55:22  <Zannick> depends on whether you're going to post it
2010-10-29T18:55:35  <McLeopold> I'm trying to build up enthusiasm...
2010-10-29T18:55:51  <Zannick> heh
2010-10-29T18:56:04  <McLeopold> I've got a rock / paper / sissors situation

2010-10-29T19:02:30  <McLeopold> so you have 2 options, go for the close one, go for the furthur one or wait for a snipe
2010-10-29T19:02:55  <McLeopold> close beats wait, wait beats far, far beats close
2010-10-29T19:03:34  <demerzel_> is that a map with forethought
2010-10-29T19:03:35  <demerzel_> ban
2010-10-29T19:03:55  <McLeopold> you don't have enough ships to take both
2010-10-29T19:04:05  <McLeopold> starting planets are 0 growth
2010-10-29T19:04:10  <McLeopold> so you never will
2010-10-29T19:04:14  <demerzel_> i would just paste that into my "bot" which is pure state atm but it would break it being <23 plaents
2010-10-29T19:04:39  <demerzel_> 0 growth starting planets is an interesting concept
2010-10-29T19:05:10  <McLeopold> demerzel_: does a constant 23 planets gain you anything?
2010-10-29T19:05:31  <McLeopold> it seems like you could just count them at the beginning and go with that
2010-10-29T19:05:44  <demerzel_> not having to add every planet-based array (a lot) into a 'resizeItIfThere'sMoreOrLess' function in c++ no less
2010-10-29T19:05:59  <demerzel_> i did do that for a long time in C# even it was a pain in teh ass
2010-10-29T19:06:15  <demerzel_> in c++ it would be a nightmare because most of them are in static private structs
2010-10-29T19:06:33  <Zannick> i just allocate after reading in all the planets
2010-10-29T19:06:48  <demerzel_> well i try to allocate as much as possible in the beginning
2010-10-29T19:06:51  <demerzel_> 2 seconds that is
2010-10-29T19:07:03  <Zannick> the initial planet list is 64, then everything is put into right-sized lists
2010-10-29T19:07:06  <Zannick> anyway
2010-10-29T19:07:21  <demerzel_> lists?
2010-10-29T19:07:25  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: comments?
2010-10-29T19:07:43  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i'm gonna lay it out visually. gimme a few
2010-10-29T19:07:43  <demerzel_> 0 growth starting planets would make more interesting games
2010-10-29T19:07:52  <demerzel_> since you'd have to choose a starting point instead of being given it
2010-10-29T19:08:21  <McLeopold> how about 0 growth and 1000 ships.
2010-10-29T19:08:27  <Zannick> visual layout would be good
2010-10-29T19:08:34  <demerzel_> too high i'd even go lower than 100
2010-10-29T19:08:43  <Zannick> i can't immediately recognize the distances here
2010-10-29T19:08:48  <McLeopold> hold on
2010-10-29T19:08:51  <demerzel_> enough to capture 1 of 4 (2 symmetrical planets)
2010-10-29T19:09:10  <jmcarthur> the stanford job fell through :(
2010-10-29T19:09:21  <Zannick> aw
2010-10-29T19:09:30  <jmcarthur> i am disappoint
2010-10-29T19:09:47  <jmcarthur> oh well. wasn't very high paying anyway
2010-10-29T19:09:52  <jmcarthur> just would have been fun
2010-10-29T19:10:56  <demerzel_> maybe i should win this shit so some real dev company will relocate me to someplace better
2010-10-29T19:11:36  <demerzel_> btw does anyone know of a code repository that isn't public only
2010-10-29T19:11:47  <demerzel_> i am fine with publishing after but not really wanting a google search to find my source
2010-10-29T19:11:53  <Zannick> bitbucket allows private repos
2010-10-29T19:11:56  <demerzel_> i am just dumping zips into mediafire atm
2010-10-29T19:12:01  <demerzel_> hmm ty

2010-10-29T19:13:30  <McLeopold> I added a distance table to the pastebin link
2010-10-29T19:13:34  <demerzel_> anybody figure out why mega1 utterly destroys everyone yet lol
2010-10-29T19:13:51  <demerzel_> he has a particular way of expansion that i can't quite figure out
2010-10-29T19:14:23  <McLeopold> is he on tcp
2010-10-29T19:15:15  <demerzel_> yep
2010-10-29T19:15:25  <demerzel_> i noticed him there before official
2010-10-29T19:15:32  <McLeopold> what's the bot name?
2010-10-29T19:15:37  <demerzel_> one of my testBot incarnations got destroyed by him
2010-10-29T19:15:41  <demerzel_> i was like who the hell of that
2010-10-29T19:15:43  <demerzel_> is*
2010-10-29T19:15:50  <demerzel_> bocsimacko
2010-10-29T19:15:54  <McLeopold> oh
2010-10-29T19:15:55  <McLeopold> him
2010-10-29T19:15:57  <demerzel_> b.3x last i saw
2010-10-29T19:16:01  <McLeopold> yeah, I think I know why
2010-10-29T19:16:17  <demerzel_> he's got forecasting but that's not new
2010-10-29T19:16:23  <demerzel_> i am trying to figure out his neutral selection
2010-10-29T19:16:26  <Zannick> McLeopold: the original is unchanged, you have to post the new one
2010-10-29T19:16:33  <demerzel_> it's strange but not distance, not payback, not overall payback

2010-10-29T19:17:27  <McLeopold> overall payback is useless
2010-10-29T19:19:49  <demerzel_> well there's 2 ways to look at individual planets imo
2010-10-29T19:19:58  <demerzel_> how quickly it gets you ships, and how many ships you will get by x turn
2010-10-29T19:20:06  <demerzel_> by payback i mean the former, only across the board
2010-10-29T19:20:21  <demerzel_> so whatever order he gets the most return was my first thought

2010-10-29T19:20:52  <demerzel_> overall payback isn't useless just has to be tempered against overall quantity
2010-10-29T19:21:31  <McLeopold> okay, ships by x turn is useless
2010-10-29T19:21:39  <demerzel_> except that's what wins games
2010-10-29T19:21:49  <demerzel_> excepting annihilation ofc
2010-10-29T19:22:02  <Zannick> it isn't the end-all of scoring
2010-10-29T19:22:28  <demerzel_> no but if you end up in a stalemate at the end and the other guy is pro and you lose by 5 it's because you didn't look at that
2010-10-29T19:23:31  <McLeopold> you knapsack grows in size, therefore ships in x turns is useless
2010-10-29T19:25:01  <demerzel_> i've given up on knapsack
2010-10-29T19:25:10  <demerzel_> too concentrated on individual planets
2010-10-29T19:27:11  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: have you finished your analysis?

2010-10-29T21:10:35  <Todd200> Yay, 3 servers up!

2010-10-29T21:12:54  <Todd200> Wow I stink at writing bots :/
2010-10-29T21:13:52  <Todd200> I wrote a future predicting offense code, and it didn't work, anyone here?
2010-10-29T21:13:55  <Frontier> If you just started now you have a difficult time to get a decent score ^^
2010-10-29T21:14:25  <Todd200> It doesn't matter, I'm building off of the starter pack anyhow
2010-10-29T21:14:47  * Todd200 is trying to learn from the experience
2010-10-29T21:15:32  <Todd200> But I can only minorly tweak the starting bot, or it will always crash
2010-10-29T21:15:33  <Frontier> That's a good way to learn. Test your bot again and again to find its weaknesses against other stronger bots.
2010-10-29T21:15:40  <demerzel_> what lang
2010-10-29T21:15:47  <Todd200> Python
2010-10-29T21:15:52  <demerzel_> oh the one i don't know haha
2010-10-29T21:16:04  <Todd200> Lol
2010-10-29T21:16:06  <demerzel_> well i don't know lisp either but i'm counting major ones
2010-10-29T21:16:07  <Frontier> Todd200: learn to code then learn to write bots :p  god damnit!
2010-10-29T21:16:17  <demerzel_> i recommend rewriting the entire bot from scratch
2010-10-29T21:16:20  <demerzel_> helped me a lot
2010-10-29T21:16:35  <Todd200> I doubt it would run
2010-10-29T21:16:36  <demerzel_> stdio stuff is pretty easy shit in most languages but you get a feel for the data structure
2010-10-29T21:17:08  <demerzel_> all you need for a running bot is something that reads 'go\n' and sends 'go\n' back
2010-10-29T21:17:12  <demerzel_> go from there ;)
2010-10-29T21:17:53  * Todd200 doesn't understand the part that submits the move, but understands rest of bot
2010-10-29T21:18:28  <Frontier> Todd200: Your bot can crash when "FinishTurn" isn't called exactly once or you send more ships than you have on a planet or you send from a planet that isn't yours. Keep in mind that there are situations when either you or the enemy doesn't posess a single planet but the game is not over
2010-10-29T21:18:29  <Todd200> Hence why I can't rewrite it
2010-10-29T21:19:18  <demerzel_> idk python standard input/output but speaking for C# and C++ both the console i/o is needlessly complex and pretty damn inefficient
2010-10-29T21:19:22  <Todd200> Irc glitch
2010-10-29T21:19:27  <Todd200> I'm blind
2010-10-29T21:19:55  <demerzel_> can write a 2 line bot lol
2010-10-29T21:20:09  <demerzel_> if (Console.Readline() == 'go\n') { Console.Writeline("go\n");}
2010-10-29T21:20:15  <demerzel_> while(true)
2010-10-29T21:20:16  <demerzel_> you win
2010-10-29T21:20:41  <Todd200> It wiill never lose to rage bot
2010-10-29T21:20:48  <Frontier> Amazing, you can also remove all whitespace from every c++ bot
2010-10-29T21:21:05  <demerzel_> what
2010-10-29T21:21:10  <Todd200> Python is whitespase sensiitive
2010-10-29T21:21:18  <demerzel_> oh wow that sucks
2010-10-29T21:21:22  <demerzel_> i had my fill of that with php
2010-10-29T21:21:23  <Todd200> So if it mess up it crashes
2010-10-29T21:21:34  <Frontier> thus you cannot write a 2 MB program in a single line like in c++
2010-10-29T21:21:43  <demerzel_> c++ is somewhat whitespace sensitive though
2010-10-29T21:21:43  <Todd200> I love python besides that
2010-10-29T21:21:58  <Todd200> <no IDE, I got notepad
2010-10-29T21:21:59  <demerzel_> if you have multiple pointers and/or you use streams (i don't)
2010-10-29T21:22:04  <demerzel_> i write C++ like oop C
2010-10-29T21:22:34  <Frontier> demerzel_: so you write imperative code using objects?
2010-10-29T21:22:47  <McLeopold> Frontier: a single line program isn't really a plus
2010-10-29T21:23:04  <demerzel_> i mean more that i don't use stdlib that much
2010-10-29T21:23:12  <Frontier> McLeopold: That statement wasn't opened to discussion.
2010-10-29T21:23:27  <McLeopold> People write beautifiers so they can some of the crap out there
2010-10-29T21:23:38  <demerzel_> i use stdio a lot more sprintf and c strings instead of std::string and <<blah>>holy<<crap<<this<<is a lot of >> weird <<shit
2010-10-29T21:24:33  <Frontier> demerzel_: I like my 'log[info] << "This works like a charm!" << endl;'
2010-10-29T21:24:51  <demerzel_> yea i use streams for file and console ;)  that's about it tho
2010-10-29T21:25:48  <Todd200> Here's my offense booster code (that doesn't work)
2010-10-29T21:26:04  <demerzel_> i am pretty proud of my c++ so far - managed to get an extracted state/supply/demand class working with oop
2010-10-29T21:26:10  <Zannick> use pastebin for code
2010-10-29T21:26:14  <Zannick> don't paste into the channel, please
2010-10-29T21:26:16  <demerzel_> yea i'm hoping he's going to ahah

2010-10-29T21:26:23  <Zannick> :)
2010-10-29T21:26:26  <Todd200> I know
2010-10-29T21:26:54  <Todd200> Why do people hate that?
2010-10-29T21:27:08  <demerzel_> are you mixing up source/dest?
2010-10-29T21:27:15  <demerzel_> iirc orders are source dest ships
2010-10-29T21:27:23  <demerzel_> idk what the starter pack function is though
2010-10-29T21:27:41  <Todd200> I defined all the variables I needed....
2010-10-29T21:27:46  <Todd200> Let's see
2010-10-29T21:27:57  <demerzel_> i am referring to -- pw.issueorder(desti, source, num_ships)
2010-10-29T21:28:11  <demerzel_> how does python work?  every loop is a foreach and types are implicit?  that's crazy
2010-10-29T21:28:18  <demerzel_> or is there a mile long dec section somewhere
2010-10-29T21:28:37  <Todd200> The source was defined by the program earlier
2010-10-29T21:29:11  <demerzel_> for some reason python is alien to me
2010-10-29T21:29:17  <demerzel_> every other lang i can read and comprehend if not fully
2010-10-29T21:29:18  <Todd200> Source = p.planetid()
2010-10-29T21:29:38  <Todd200> I'm the opposite, I'm just bad at writing
2010-10-29T21:29:57  <demerzel_> no i mean check the issueorder section
2010-10-29T21:30:10  <demerzel_> you are giving it (dest, source, ships) i'm pretty sure it should be (source, dest, ships)
2010-10-29T21:30:18  <demerzel_> if it's not that's bizarre because that's the order it prints it
2010-10-29T21:30:45  <Todd200>  I'll check
2010-10-29T21:31:23  <Todd200> Nice, there's my first problem
2010-10-29T21:31:37  <demerzel_> i'm not sure what you're trying to do there
2010-10-29T21:31:56  <demerzel_> that's iterating your fleets in flight

2010-10-29T21:32:09  <demerzel_> you are adding defense per turns left and doing what with it?
2010-10-29T21:32:16  <Todd200> It looks at my fleets in flight, sees if they will kill the target, if not it sends extra
2010-10-29T21:32:32  <demerzel_> ahhh ok
2010-10-29T21:32:36  <demerzel_> that should work
2010-10-29T21:33:03  <Todd200> And it calculates how many ships the planet will have when my fleet arrives
2010-10-29T21:33:14  <demerzel_> except you're not counting enemy fleets inbound
2010-10-29T21:33:18  <demerzel_> you should add that
2010-10-29T21:33:38  <Todd200> I'll add defense after ofference starts working
2010-10-29T21:33:45  <demerzel_> no i mean you're iterating turns
2010-10-29T21:33:55  <demerzel_> check enemy fleets instead and just add growth * turns beforehand
2010-10-29T21:34:20  <Todd200> You're, right, I need to could their defense fleets
2010-10-29T21:34:32  <demerzel_> i'd calc the growth in before i launched
2010-10-29T21:34:38  <demerzel_> then you only need to check enemy fleets
2010-10-29T21:34:58  <Todd200> True, it would keep my loops smaller
2010-10-29T21:35:00  <demerzel_> since their growth isn't going to change ;)
2010-10-29T21:35:26  <Todd200> As of right now it's sending 1/4 of it's strongest planet to the most cost effective planet
2010-10-29T21:36:04  <Todd200> So no pre-flight calculations

2010-10-29T21:37:19  <demerzel_> nice
2010-10-29T21:37:47  <Todd200> It still is firing blindly and doesn't care if it gets the planet it attacked or not
2010-10-29T21:37:55  <demerzel_> sending a % of your source doesn't make sense for long though
2010-10-29T21:38:15  <demerzel_> only thing that matters is whether you take something or not, you can just calc how much you need - (ships + (growth * distance)) + 1
2010-10-29T21:38:18  <demerzel_> if you got it, send it
2010-10-29T21:38:38  <demerzel_> excluding neutrals of course
2010-10-29T21:38:44  <Todd200> My bot will have a lot of if loops
2010-10-29T21:38:50  <demerzel_> welcome lol
2010-10-29T21:39:26  <demerzel_> i will tell you how i have done it since my first bot
2010-10-29T21:39:37  <demerzel_> calc all pops for all planets for all turns from this turn on
2010-10-29T21:39:42  <demerzel_> prior to starting my turn
2010-10-29T21:39:59  <demerzel_> then i can simply just say do i have planet2[turn + distance] ships?  if so send
2010-10-29T21:40:27  <demerzel_> neutrals are just the same number x 200
2010-10-29T21:40:40  <Todd200> I was trying to add distance to my value of planet calcations, instant crash
2010-10-29T21:40:59  <demerzel_> you should check that it's not the same index
2010-10-29T21:41:05  <janzert> lavalamp_: is there go starter kit I can test with?
2010-10-29T21:41:13  <Todd200> ?
2010-10-29T21:41:15  <demerzel_> i cache planet distances on turn 1 actually
2010-10-29T21:41:47  <demerzel_> since they don't change and distances are incredibly useful
2010-10-29T21:41:59  <demerzel_> i would say the most important number after 'ships'
2010-10-29T21:42:12  <Todd200> Then production
2010-10-29T21:42:36  <Todd200> ;)
2010-10-29T21:43:07  <Todd200> So I need to figure out distances
2010-10-29T21:43:48  <demerzel_> production is 'ships' though
2010-10-29T21:43:55  <demerzel_> just not ships you have now ;)
2010-10-29T21:44:03  <Todd200> True
2010-10-29T21:45:48  <Todd200> Couldn't you crash a futureseeing bot by using lots of fireworks?
2010-10-29T21:46:10  <demerzel_> only if they are very poorly optimized hehe
2010-10-29T21:46:26  <demerzel_> considering you only need to consider the enemy fleets once
2010-10-29T21:46:28  <Todd200> Mine would crash vs fireworks then
2010-10-29T21:47:13  <demerzel_> why can you not click on names in tcp server argh
2010-10-29T21:47:15  <Todd200> The code I showed you looks at every fleet every turn
2010-10-29T21:47:21  <Todd200> Fireworks would destroy it
2010-10-29T21:47:32  <demerzel_> nah i think you underestimate
2010-10-29T21:47:50  <demerzel_> it's not efficient i agree but i doubt even 1000 iterations would bother a modern computer

2010-10-29T21:49:07  <Todd200> I need a better offense system, instead of a strongest planet attack
2010-10-29T21:49:32  <Todd200> And I'm too noobish to code supply trains
2010-10-29T21:49:47  <demerzel_> A thousand instructions per second (kIPS) is rarely used, as most current microprocessors can execute a least a billion instructions per second
2010-10-29T21:50:09  <Todd200> :/
2010-10-29T21:50:19  <demerzel_> now granted those are asm level but i doubt python is that horribly bloated
2010-10-29T21:50:24  <demerzel_> supply trains are distance based
2010-10-29T21:50:34  <Todd200> I know
2010-10-29T21:50:53  <demerzel_> read this thread
2010-10-29T21:50:54  <demerzel_> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=894
2010-10-29T21:51:01  <demerzel_> it's pretty simple to make an easy one
2010-10-29T21:51:08  <demerzel_> or rather the math behind it is simple
2010-10-29T21:51:37  <Todd200> I was thinking of an organized swarm instead of paths
2010-10-29T21:51:55  <Todd200> And an endgame code :)
2010-10-29T21:52:45  <Todd200> If I have 150% enemies ships and 125% enemies production rate, finish the job
2010-10-29T21:53:07  <Todd200> Or something of that idea
2010-10-29T21:54:49  <Todd200> I also need defense :/
2010-10-29T21:55:23  <Todd200> And a 6 ship sniper would be cool
