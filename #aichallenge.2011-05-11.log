2011-05-11T02:34:38  <antimatroid> you get passed the radius squared, so it will definitely be an integer
2011-05-11T02:34:50  <antimatroid> so say the view radius was 9, you would be passed view2 = 81
2011-05-11T02:34:58  <antimatroid> but then we can have non-integer distances

2011-05-11T02:49:26  <qacek> I was confused about whether or not it was somehow measuring manhattan or euclidean distance or something else
2011-05-11T02:49:39  <qacek> in hindsight it makes sense that its euclidean though

2011-05-11T03:07:54  <antimatroid> it makes some things stupidly complicated
2011-05-11T03:08:36  <antimatroid> we should have just used the manhatten or chebyshev metric

2011-05-11T14:28:35  <McLeopold> actually it was 0755 -> 493, which is worse
2011-05-11T14:28:56  <janzert> 0 prefix makes it octal which is what chmod numerals are
2011-05-11T14:29:15  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-05-11T14:29:33  <janzert> 0755 should be u=rwx go=rx

2011-05-11T14:30:09  <janzert> ahh, that would be a bug
2011-05-11T14:30:20  <McLeopold> got it backwards then
2011-05-11T14:33:30  <janzert> fun little fact, chmod is pretty much the reason for octal literals in python and there was talk, although I don't know if it happened or not, about dropping them in python3

2011-05-11T15:42:58  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm getting an error with running a functional test in the jail
2011-05-11T15:43:17  <McLeopold> Could not change owner on /srv/chroot/jailuser1/scratch
2011-05-11T15:44:10  <McLeopold> Exception sandbox.JailError: JailError('Jail object for jailuser1 freed without being released',) in <bound method _Jail.__del__ of <sandbox._Jail object at 0xa12160c>> ignored
2011-05-11T15:48:49  <janzert> is the setuid bit and owner correct on the jail_own program in worker? it should look like "-rwsrwx---  1 root    contest"
2011-05-11T15:49:01  <McLeopold> i'll check
2011-05-11T15:49:21  <McLeopold> nope
2011-05-11T15:49:27  <McLeopold> -rwxrwx---
2011-05-11T15:50:08  <McLeopold> It seems like the server_setup didn't do any permissions correctly
2011-05-11T15:50:31  <janzert> should be a line at the end of setup_base_chroot: run_cmd("chmod u=rwxs,g=rwx,o= jail_own")
2011-05-11T15:50:35  <McLeopold> the www-data group wasn't applied to directories either
2011-05-11T15:51:45  <janzert> I even used the command line chmod there so I could use symbolic settings to make it more obvious what it was doing :)
2011-05-11T15:52:19  <janzert> I don't think it would have run at all, but the setup scripts were run as root right?
2011-05-11T15:52:34  <McLeopold> yes, with sudo
2011-05-11T15:52:38  <janzert> ok
2011-05-11T15:58:33  <McLeopold> what's the easiest way to start over?  rm -Rf /home/contest/* ?
2011-05-11T15:59:21  <McLeopold> and rm -Rf /srv
2011-05-11T15:59:45  <janzert> you'll need to remove the created users as well
2011-05-11T15:59:50  <janzert> at least
2011-05-11T16:00:02  <janzert> not sure of anything else
2011-05-11T16:00:25  <McLeopold> what's the command for that?
2011-05-11T16:01:01  <janzert> userdel
