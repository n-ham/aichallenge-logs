2010-11-09T00:01:51  <raedwulf> yea
2010-11-09T00:02:00  <raedwulf> technically it should *block* the caller
2010-11-09T00:02:16  <raedwulf> but i came across the same  issue - my fixed my problem though
2010-11-09T00:02:19  <raedwulf> mine*
2010-11-09T00:02:24  <demerzel_> that's what i thought but i am totally not getting blocked it just hiccups and dies
2010-11-09T00:03:06  <demerzel_> you can even see stderr gets jacked
2010-11-09T00:03:10  <demerzel_> it doesn't finish HI lol
2010-11-09T00:03:25  <raedwulf> you can fflush stderr?
2010-11-09T00:03:42  <demerzel_> well that's not my issue
2010-11-09T00:03:48  <demerzel_> fflush(stdin) just locks it too
2010-11-09T00:04:01  <raedwulf> how did you have it working before?
2010-11-09T00:04:07  <demerzel_> i just tried fgets with a fprintf after it it didn't pritn anything
2010-11-09T00:04:14  <demerzel_> i haven't ever used stdin/out - pure socket code to tcp
2010-11-09T00:04:16  <McLeopold> demerzel_: can you release just your framework in c so I can try and test it?
2010-11-09T00:04:28  <McLeopold> just a bot that does nothing
2010-11-09T00:04:33  <demerzel_> yea sure
2010-11-09T00:06:42  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: one night i made changes, incrementally testing on an old bot the whole time
2010-11-09T00:06:47  <antimatroid1> i broke so many things
2010-11-09T00:06:54  <McLeopold> :)
2010-11-09T00:07:04  <McLeopold> I'm sooo glad I've got scm.
2010-11-09T00:07:13  <bhasker> heh
2010-11-09T00:07:23  <McLeopold> I would have lost some crucial pieces.
2010-11-09T00:07:25  <antimatroid1> my backups are just a big folder of zips aha
2010-11-09T00:07:35  <McLeopold> I forgot about the whole idea I just restored.
2010-11-09T00:08:05  <antimatroid1> i just reached freedom from exams a few hours ago, i will be creating a new bot soon enough
2010-11-09T00:08:28  <McLeopold> I also use eclipse with svn, so it is super easy to compare and merge.
2010-11-09T00:09:32  <McLeopold> help me solve this one: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=917105
2010-11-09T00:10:42  <antimatroid1> you expanded a second time

2010-11-09T00:22:07  <antimatroid1> Mcleopold: are you looking at what's going to happen once you take a planet?
2010-11-09T00:22:19  <antimatroid1> it seems as though your bot just saw that it could take it
2010-11-09T00:22:27  <antimatroid1> but didn't bother to check it could sustain that claim
2010-11-09T00:22:44  <antimatroid1> it's things like that which have left me doing moves to a planet at a time into the futuer
2010-11-09T00:22:44  <McLeopold> yep
2010-11-09T00:23:25  <McLeopold> or, more critically, it didn't notice that it couldn't sustain the first planet.
2010-11-09T00:23:25  <antimatroid1> not at a time*, i just make moves into the future assuming i need to counter them, but only send fleets that i have to at time 0
2010-11-09T00:23:47  <antimatroid1> why not?
2010-11-09T00:24:23  <McLeopold> well, I should have left a few planets back just incase the 5 on the enemy home planet got sent, which they did.
2010-11-09T00:24:40  <McLeopold> which means I didn't have the 18 to take the second planet
2010-11-09T00:25:11  <antimatroid1> oh, i see what you mean, i thought you meant when you claimed it
2010-11-09T00:25:43  <antimatroid1> i wonder if it's worth waiting on expanding at all if you're ahead
2010-11-09T00:25:54  <McLeopold> absolutely
2010-11-09T00:26:04  <antimatroid1> i think it'd be fairly rare where that might hurt you, and even rarer that the other bot exploited that
2010-11-09T00:26:05  <McLeopold> let me find an example...
2010-11-09T00:28:26  <davidjliu> heh, my new bot seems to like the defensive strategy of allowing the enemy to capture my planet for one turn...

2010-11-09T00:31:19  <antimatroid1> hmmm okay, more interesting would be examples where a bot waited while ahead and shouldn't have
2010-11-09T00:31:29  <McLeopold> okay
2010-11-09T00:31:30  <antimatroid1> and even better the other bot exploited the opportunity

2010-11-09T00:34:38  <antimatroid1> what am i looking for?
2010-11-09T00:35:10  <McLeopold> cccf waited to expand and shouldn't have, but wasn't ahead
2010-11-09T00:36:19  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'm more curious about how unlikely it is that you should expand even though you're ahead to avoid a certain loss
2010-11-09T00:36:52  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=917370

2010-11-09T03:21:49  <raedwulf> how i handle it is that i run two passes
2010-11-09T03:22:07  <antimatroid1> two passes for what?
2010-11-09T03:22:09  <raedwulf> one to parse the data into a fixed size array and then i  allocate all my planets etc.
2010-11-09T03:22:16  <antimatroid1> i'm about to fix it up so i'm not recreating objects every move
2010-11-09T03:22:20  <antimatroid1> and i don't really store fleets like that
2010-11-09T03:22:25  <antimatroid1> i'm in the middle of doing a full rewrite
2010-11-09T03:22:31  <raedwulf> ah ok ^^
2010-11-09T03:22:46  <raedwulf> my code wouldn't need a rewrite at all (but i design things like that)
2010-11-09T03:22:50  <antimatroid1> my other code has been going since the moment the contest opened
2010-11-09T03:22:54  <antimatroid1> so is rather messy
2010-11-09T03:23:18  <antimatroid1> and i've been nonstop just trying strategies all over the place
2010-11-09T03:23:22  <raedwulf> thats why it takes me too long... i think of all the potential possibilities and make my base code as generic as possible
2010-11-09T03:23:23  <antimatroid1> except the last week cause of exams D:
2010-11-09T03:23:43  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-11-09T03:23:50  <antimatroid1> my other code has stuff for decision trees, game trees (with minimax) and zero sum games
2010-11-09T03:23:51  <raedwulf> do you think you did well in the exams?
2010-11-09T03:24:08  <antimatroid1> not particularly well, i have spent too much time on ai this semester
2010-11-09T03:24:15  <antimatroid1> but don't really care, undergrad is now finished
2010-11-09T03:24:37  <raedwulf> :P ^^
2010-11-09T03:24:47  <antimatroid1> should still get mostly hds and dn's so i can live with that
2010-11-09T03:24:58  <raedwulf> :D
2010-11-09T03:25:13  <raedwulf> thats good , i assume hd = high distinctions and dn = distinctions
2010-11-09T03:25:41  <antimatroid1> not sure i'll pull that off with graphics, i didn't go to class since week one, did each of the two assignments the day they were due, studied for the exam on the day and then when i went to clean out that section of my folder, all i had was the unit outline :P
2010-11-09T03:25:45  <antimatroid1> yep

2010-11-09T03:28:35  <raedwulf> i have a couple of other projects that need attention from me :/
2010-11-09T03:28:53  <raedwulf> haven't had time because when i've been coding - i've been coding this instead
2010-11-09T03:29:08  <antimatroid1> yeah, i normally work my ass off
2010-11-09T03:29:16  <antimatroid1> my other 4 units were all maths and got more attention
2010-11-09T03:29:24  <antimatroid1> but i've been distracted with ai :P
2010-11-09T03:29:28  <raedwulf> lol
2010-11-09T03:29:40  <raedwulf> thankfully this contest only runs till 29th
2010-11-09T03:29:47  <antimatroid1> i pulled an all nighter last night so i didn't fail pdes
2010-11-09T03:29:49  <raedwulf> my exams are in january
2010-11-09T03:30:11  <antimatroid1> i have nothing to do till the end of the contest but write my bot though :P
2010-11-09T03:30:18  <raedwulf> :)
2010-11-09T03:31:36  <antimatroid1> oh god, even the main method is painful

2010-11-09T03:40:01  <raedwulf> then i can leave it for a week and get some other work done
2010-11-09T03:40:23  <antimatroid1> lol, that's what i kept telling myself
2010-11-09T03:40:36  <antimatroid1> i'm going to take my time with this one
2010-11-09T03:40:40  * raedwulf is naming various strategies after characters in norse mythology
2010-11-09T03:40:55  <raedwulf> so far, Odin and Thialfi
2010-11-09T03:41:03  <antimatroid1> i was originally going to have a robot unicorn theme with my code, i'm so glad i abandoned that early
2010-11-09T03:41:09  <raedwulf> haha
2010-11-09T03:41:22  <antimatroid1> my username on the main site is "youwillfail" though
2010-11-09T03:41:26  <antimatroid1> but no bot is up there atm
2010-11-09T03:42:16  <raedwulf> ah ok
2010-11-09T03:42:26  <raedwulf> my rage bot is ranked about 2300
2010-11-09T03:43:15  <antimatroid1> plenty of room for improvement :P
2010-11-09T03:43:19  <raedwulf> :)
2010-11-09T03:43:21  <raedwulf> yep
2010-11-09T03:43:32  <antimatroid1> i'm chasing top 10
2010-11-09T03:43:41  <raedwulf> but my heuristic bot doesn't have a defense strategy and my other bot doesn't have an offensive strategy
2010-11-09T03:43:42  <raedwulf> lol
2010-11-09T03:43:45  <antimatroid1> i had it robbed from me in tron
2010-11-09T03:43:54  <raedwulf> so by themselves, they are pretty useless
2010-11-09T03:52:04  <antimatroid1> i've been awake for 38 hours :|, sleep is going to be really good tonight
2010-11-09T03:53:51  <raedwulf> :)

2010-11-09T04:43:11  <sigh> eval functions are ridiculously hard to get right
2010-11-09T04:43:19  <antimatroid1> they are

2010-11-09T04:43:43  <antimatroid1> well actually, my eval function is pretty straight forward, it's move selection that i find hardest
2010-11-09T04:43:43  <lavalamp_> it helps to evaluate the correct turn
2010-11-09T04:43:59  <lavalamp_> I'm actually working on move selection atm too
2010-11-09T04:44:11  <sigh> mine too... kind of by force, everytime i try to it change it, it gets worse

2010-11-09T04:45:43  <raedwulf> but its tricky to write an allocation system for it
2010-11-09T04:45:44  <antimatroid1> what i think is hardest is resolving battles with both players making future moves
2010-11-09T04:46:03  <sigh> my hypothetical enemy can't make moves

2010-11-09T04:59:56  <raedwulf> but yea i put a lot of effort into the code
2010-11-09T04:59:58  <antimatroid1> this contest is worse than crack
2010-11-09T05:00:01  <raedwulf> haha
2010-11-09T05:00:17  <raedwulf> i think i might wait till the next contest - because at least then i will be looking out for it
2010-11-09T05:00:21  <raedwulf> rather than starting it mid-way
2010-11-09T05:00:34  <raedwulf> then i would have loads more time
2010-11-09T05:01:26  <raedwulf> e.g. if i knew it started in september, i would have at least 1 month before term starts :P
2010-11-09T05:01:34  <raedwulf> anywas good luck everyone
2010-11-09T05:01:43  <antimatroid1> the last one was in february this year
2010-11-09T05:02:58  <raedwulf> february is ok too i guess
2010-11-09T05:03:19  <antimatroid1> we do necessarily get the planets in the same order each turn yes?
2010-11-09T05:03:39  <raedwulf> tbh, at the rate im going with all my work, ill get something decent working by the 29th, but it'll not be groundbreaking
2010-11-09T05:03:49  <raedwulf> antimatroid1: yes, but i don't depend on that
2010-11-09T05:04:11  <raedwulf> also i have an assignment tomorrow

2010-11-09T07:37:12  <phreeza> yea i have a bot running it
2010-11-09T07:37:20  <phreeza> it can win games :)
2010-11-09T07:37:22  <sigh> still dimwit? :P
2010-11-09T07:37:26  <phreeza> but not enough
2010-11-09T07:37:28  <phreeza> yea
2010-11-09T07:38:23  <phreeza> the major flaw is that it fails to see that it can be sniped...
2010-11-09T07:38:31  <sigh> dimishwit? is that you?

2010-11-09T07:39:36  <sigh> i guess that one isn't you
2010-11-09T07:39:41  <phreeza> thats me too

2010-11-09T07:39:49  <sigh> haha... ok :)

2010-11-09T07:40:20  <phreeza> haha
2010-11-09T07:42:19  <phreeza> i might do another version before the contest, more efficient and with something like forced moves for sniping etc...

2010-11-09T07:42:36  <phreeza> but for now i'm working on a case based resoning thing
2010-11-09T07:42:51  <phreeza> to see if that can be done ;)
2010-11-09T07:43:06  <phreeza> haven't heard anyone else trying that
2010-11-09T07:43:22  <sigh> it's hard
2010-11-09T07:43:25  <sigh> :P
2010-11-09T07:43:38  <phreeza> indeed :)
2010-11-09T07:44:13  <sigh> the problem is that you probably don't understand the game as well as you think you do :)
2010-11-09T07:44:45  <lavalamp_> hey I have a pretty low opnion of how well I understand this game
2010-11-09T07:45:07  <sigh> :P
2010-11-09T07:45:13  <phreeza> :D
2010-11-09T07:45:27  <sigh> hmm... I really need to look into UCT sometime... I don't understand it is effective, especially in games like Go
2010-11-09T07:46:07  <Error323> uct?
2010-11-09T07:46:27  <sigh> UCT is a guided monte-carlo tree search algorithm
2010-11-09T07:47:14  <sigh> *I don't understand how it is effective
2010-11-09T07:47:51  <sigh> UCT = "Upper Confidence Bounds Applied to Trees"

2010-11-09T07:48:22  <phreeza> i think ther main advantage over minimax is it gives the best possible results even if you abort early
2010-11-09T07:48:41  <sigh> you can do that in minimax with iterative deepening
2010-11-09T07:49:06  <Error323> oh
2010-11-09T07:49:07  <phreeza> kinda, but uct is smarter about it
2010-11-09T07:49:20  <lavalamp_> UCT/monte carlo's advantage over minimax is that it can deal with enormous branching factors
2010-11-09T07:49:32  <sigh> yeah, that's my understanding

2010-11-09T07:51:24  <phreeza> a problem i ran into is that according to the pure uct algorithm every node in ply 1 gets played at least once to begin with
2010-11-09T07:51:28  <phreeza> you can do that in go
2010-11-09T07:51:40  <phreeza> but not in PW
2010-11-09T07:51:45  <sigh> ah, planet was has too many moves
2010-11-09T07:51:56  <sigh> owned by branching factor :D
2010-11-09T07:52:00  <phreeza> so i had to artificially limit the layer width
2010-11-09T07:52:28  <phreeza> yea the branching factor is many orders of magnitude larger than in go
2010-11-09T07:53:27  <phreeza> but i randomly sampled the tree, like an additional monte carlo layer ;)
2010-11-09T07:53:50  <sigh> :)
2010-11-09T07:54:43  <Error323> whats the action set in these type of methods
2010-11-09T07:54:56  <Error323> because that seems to be the biggest issue
2010-11-09T07:55:30  <phreeza> yea mine is super naive... i tried o improve it but that only made it worse
2010-11-09T07:56:21  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-09T07:56:26  <Error323> the assumptions work both ways
2010-11-09T07:56:31  <phreeza> basically from a random sampling 30% of your planets, send a random amount to a random planet
2010-11-09T07:56:35  <Error323> i also made a very simple version
2010-11-09T07:56:41  <Error323> take 1 planet per turn
2010-11-09T07:56:47  <Error323> which didn't even rank lowest ^_^
2010-11-09T07:56:50  <Error323> at tcp
2010-11-09T07:56:54  <Error323> -300 or sth
2010-11-09T07:57:10  <phreeza> hehe
2010-11-09T07:57:13  <phreeza> with minimax?
2010-11-09T07:57:16  <Error323> ye
2010-11-09T07:57:41  <phreeza> you should try it with UCT
2010-11-09T07:57:48  <phreeza> not a complicated algorithm
2010-11-09T07:58:05  <Error323> well using alphabeta atm
2010-11-09T07:58:13  <Error323> but a massive actionset
2010-11-09T07:58:20  <Error323> sometimes 30 sec per turn locally

2010-11-09T07:59:22  <Error323> with my heuristics it beats my old

2010-11-09T08:00:07  <sigh> so, what sort of branching factor do you have?
2010-11-09T08:00:10  <Error323> this was my test alphabeta =)
2010-11-09T08:00:27  <Error323> currently its massive, around 2000 :P
2010-11-09T08:00:35  <Error323> 20000 sometimes
2010-11-09T08:00:37  <phreeza> I think with 60s to compute i'd run out of memory before i run out of time
2010-11-09T08:00:41  <sigh> yeah, that's a tad high :)

2010-11-09T08:02:39  <Error323> branching factor is 23 (nr of planets)
2010-11-09T08:02:48  <Error323> and it has my staging algo
2010-11-09T08:02:49  <Error323> that's it

2010-11-09T08:03:13  <phreeza> ah with 23 why don't you go deeper?
2010-11-09T08:03:29  <Error323> doesn't make sens
2010-11-09T08:03:36  <Error323> this was a test anyway

2010-11-09T08:04:31  <phreeza> why does that game terminate
2010-11-09T08:04:54  <phreeza> doesn't say timeout or disconnect
2010-11-09T08:05:06  <Error323> no idea
2010-11-09T08:05:10  <sigh> and XYZ is taking a 0 growth -_-

2010-11-09T08:12:03  <sigh> simulate to the end? assuming that no one makes any more moves?
2010-11-09T08:12:09  <Error323> indd
2010-11-09T08:12:26  <sigh> yeah, that over-values planet growth rates
2010-11-09T08:12:30  <mega1> I couldn't make alpha-beta work well with more than 1 play

2010-11-09T08:12:47  <Error323> but got it working
2010-11-09T08:13:05  <mega1> *ply
2010-11-09T08:13:32  <Error323> that is, alphabeta gives same amount of turns as minimax in half the cpu time. I guess that says it works
2010-11-09T08:13:48  <Error323> same endresult that is

2010-11-09T08:53:19  <bhasker> heh so how are you doing it , what is your move generator function like
2010-11-09T08:53:21  <Error323> it does both max and min
2010-11-09T08:53:24  <bhasker> does it like pick a target planet
2010-11-09T08:53:28  <bhasker> and generate moves to capture it
2010-11-09T08:53:32  <bhasker> in the next X turns
2010-11-09T08:53:40  <bhasker> and you do the same for all the planets?
2010-11-09T08:53:43  <Error323> mm no
2010-11-09T08:54:19  <mega1> bhasker: yes, the max only version is the best performing one so far
2010-11-09T08:54:20  <Error323> i only use a selection for attacking (those that get fed through staging) and compute all combinations against enemyplantes
2010-11-09T08:54:52  <Error323> ehhh what do you guys mean by max only?
2010-11-09T08:55:08  <bhasker> Error I am not sure i understand what you mean by "selection for attacking"
2010-11-09T08:55:25  <Error323> selection of my planets that are allowed to attack
2010-11-09T08:55:39  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-11-09T08:55:45  <Error323> but its failing hard here xD
2010-11-09T08:55:48  <bhasker> heh
2010-11-09T08:56:01  <Error323> though my alphabeta is working properly
2010-11-09T08:56:03  <bhasker> and how do you compute available ships, i am having trouble with that
2010-11-09T08:56:17  <bhasker> not implemented min max yet
2010-11-09T08:56:22  <bhasker> when i try to account for future shis
2010-11-09T08:56:27  <bhasker> my bot just gets too conservative:-\
2010-11-09T08:56:30  <bhasker> and doesn't do crap
2010-11-09T08:56:46  <Error323> available ships?
2010-11-09T08:57:02  <Error323> how do you mean
2010-11-09T08:57:13  <bhasker> as in how do you compute how many ships you can send from a given planet
2010-11-09T08:57:17  <bhasker> without losing it
2010-11-09T08:57:29  <Error323> i don't :P
2010-11-09T08:57:34  <bhasker> whenever i try to get that accurate it grinds to a halt
2010-11-09T08:57:39  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-09T08:57:50  <bhasker> so you assume that you can always send all your ships?
2010-11-09T08:57:55  <Error323> yes
2010-11-09T08:57:56  <bhasker> as long as its not under attack?
2010-11-09T08:58:10  <Error323> yes
2010-11-09T08:58:19  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-09T08:58:57  <bhasker> even your frontline planets?
2010-11-09T08:59:17  <Error323> especially those
2010-11-09T08:59:34  <bhasker> hmm don't you like lose planets that way when you send out to the wrong target
2010-11-09T08:59:35  <bhasker> from front
2010-11-09T08:59:53  <Error323> i have quite a neat target selector :>
2010-11-09T09:00:01  <bhasker> hmm but if its wrong
2010-11-09T09:00:03  <Error323> if i don't use that
2010-11-09T09:00:07  <Error323> it goes horribly wrong
2010-11-09T09:00:10  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-11-09T09:00:44  <Error323> well 'neat'... its just simple but very effective
2010-11-09T09:01:08  <Error323> but yes sometimes it doesn't work
2010-11-09T09:01:18  <Error323> thats why i lose from e.g. shampoo sometimes :P
2010-11-09T09:03:12  <bhasker> heh
2010-11-09T09:03:28  <Error323> i can't stand it
2010-11-09T09:04:01  <Error323> got a very beatiful piece of code that does my alphabeta, but i can't get a good heuristic function and actionset
2010-11-09T09:04:04  <Error323> >_<

2010-11-09T09:05:55  <Error323> mega1: bhasker what is this max only?
2010-11-09T09:06:11  <bhasker> you just look at moves that maximize your value
2010-11-09T09:06:15  <bhasker> and same for enemies
2010-11-09T09:07:01  <mega1> Error323: one ply minimax: enemy moves are not considered, the evaluation function is supposed to take care of that
2010-11-09T09:07:24  <bhasker> mega1 you don't even look at enemy's move is it?
2010-11-09T09:07:30  <mega1> yes
2010-11-09T09:07:31  <Error323> oh
2010-11-09T09:07:32  <bhasker> just generate all possible moves for you
2010-11-09T09:07:38  <bhasker> and maximize the value
2010-11-09T09:07:42  <mega1> some :-)

2010-11-09T09:07:49  <bhasker> yea some possible moves
2010-11-09T09:07:54  <bhasker> hmm i have been considering that
2010-11-09T09:08:16  <bhasker> right now i assume my priority queue will do that,since its ordered by planet value
2010-11-09T09:08:22  <bhasker> but that doesn't work out right
2010-11-09T09:08:27  <bhasker> sometimes i pick moves to attack far off planets
2010-11-09T09:08:36  <bhasker> which are far worse than sending those ships at nearer targets
2010-11-09T09:09:07  <bhasker> and mega1 what do you evaluate?, the value at next turn?
2010-11-09T09:09:15  <bhasker> or the value at the end of executing the curent turn
2010-11-09T09:09:31  <mega1> the value at some future turn
2010-11-09T09:09:42  <bhasker> so thats your look ahead?
2010-11-09T09:09:54  <mega1> or "horizon"
2010-11-09T09:09:56  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-09T09:11:14  <Error323> interesting
2010-11-09T09:14:36  <Error323> yeah this is all about defining a good heuristic eval function

2010-11-09T10:04:26  <Ice_Harley> I have 2 last games lost in first turn... http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=6494
2010-11-09T10:04:45  <Ice_Harley> like before they fix that bug
2010-11-09T10:05:00  <demerzel_> oh my old bot was C# i know that problem hehe
2010-11-09T10:05:39  <Ice_Harley> but that was already fixed
2010-11-09T10:06:13  <demerzel_> nope i was hoping McLeopold or lavalamp_ would have something to say, had the problem since yesterday
2010-11-09T10:06:19  <Ice_Harley> after that fix i go to near 380 position from near 1000 without changing bot )
2010-11-09T10:06:41  <Error323> what bug is that
2010-11-09T10:07:20  <Ice_Harley> first turn loses. Especially for C#, but other langs too
2010-11-09T10:07:50  <demerzel_> no mine is very specific

2010-11-09T11:49:11  <Frontier> void io_sendInput(const char *newInput){ printf("%s", newInput); }
2010-11-09T11:49:11  <Frontier> supposed to look like?
2010-11-09T11:51:13  <demerzel_> just print it out
2010-11-09T11:51:30  <demerzel_> what are you using to redirect to it
2010-11-09T11:52:00  <demerzel_> problem is the server/game engines don't pipe out continously it's hitting some wall and breaking on main server and here on windows
2010-11-09T11:52:09  <demerzel_> if you pipe the file to it it does fine
2010-11-09T11:54:16  <demerzel_> oh it says HI go?  did you tyype go at it or give it a file?  it should be saying HI <whatever the last fgets was>
2010-11-09T11:54:26  <demerzel_> per line
2010-11-09T11:55:38  <Frontier> i gave it a map through my server

2010-11-09T12:00:54  <demerzel_> part of the problem is it's also a DOS issue
2010-11-09T12:00:58  <demerzel_> but it's broken on the main server too
2010-11-09T12:01:13  <demerzel_> it's frustrating because i can't get it working here so i can't focus on making it work on main
2010-11-09T12:04:16  <Frontier> lol, what did you DO? why does it not pipe correctly?
2010-11-09T12:04:25  <demerzel_> i have no goddamn idea to either
2010-11-09T12:04:33  <demerzel_> it should work, it does work in all situations BUT the one i need
2010-11-09T12:04:48  <demerzel_> works here piped to works typed to doesn't work when it's a child process
2010-11-09T12:05:27  <demerzel_> apparently same for server because i uploaded a barebones io like that to the server and it's still broke
2010-11-09T12:07:47  <demerzel_> the hardest part of thsi is i have no way to really check it as a child process - it just does/doesn't do whatever
2010-11-09T12:08:01  <demerzel_> testing is impossible i just make a change, copy exe and pray

2010-11-09T12:11:55  <demerzel_> you won't have to hear me bitch about it any more lol
2010-11-09T12:12:35  <Frontier> lol, send me a virtual beer. anyway, you didn't flush after the "go\n".
2010-11-09T12:12:50  <demerzel_> flush out?
2010-11-09T12:13:04  <demerzel_> i don't even get that far
2010-11-09T12:13:22  <Frontier> in c++ "cout << "go" << endl;" does the same as "... fflush(stdout);"
2010-11-09T12:13:33  <demerzel_> yea i know - it doesn't get that far
2010-11-09T12:13:39  <demerzel_> doesn't even finish reading the state
2010-11-09T12:13:48  <demerzel_> so it never sends that
2010-11-09T12:13:53  <Frontier> but if it did, it would help ^^
2010-11-09T12:14:05  <demerzel_> well if it did and then froze i would hvae a diff problem ;)
2010-11-09T12:14:41  <Frontier> how can i make your bot fail while reading the state?
2010-11-09T12:15:05  <demerzel_> upload it tothe server lol
2010-11-09T12:15:14  <demerzel_> or use iouri's planetwarrior
2010-11-09T12:15:26  <demerzel_> i had it set up to fgetc instead of fgets and spit out each char
2010-11-09T12:15:38  <demerzel_> this was the output, dead at p18: http://pastebin.com/rQq5Kt5g

2010-11-09T12:19:41  <demerzel_> :P
2010-11-09T12:20:04  <Frontier> And you are sure you can read whole lines from stdin?
2010-11-09T12:20:09  <demerzel_> no i am not
2010-11-09T12:20:14  <demerzel_> i don't think i can
2010-11-09T12:20:22  <Frontier> then dont ^^
2010-11-09T12:20:23  <demerzel_> you can see i have a hook after fgets
2010-11-09T12:20:30  <demerzel_> it never has output anything
2010-11-09T12:20:33  <demerzel_> that's why i tried single char

2010-11-09T12:23:51  <Frontier> now what if the server sends you 1k of map data, the flushes and sends you the rest of the line in the next go. first of all: your buffer only reads 128 bytes and expects the data to be a single line, then the next read starts in the middle of a line which is also bad. try to buffer what you read from stdin and extract the lines manually. that's what i do anyway
2010-11-09T12:25:36  <demerzel_> yea i'm working on that angle ;)

2010-11-09T13:36:07  <demerzel_> then i spent the next 24 hours trying to debug c stdin redirection problems lol
2010-11-09T13:36:14  <mega1> but candidate move generation is very expensive
2010-11-09T13:36:34  <mega1> better than fighting cygwin I guess
2010-11-09T13:36:43  <demerzel_> it's been a nightmare honestly
2010-11-09T13:36:53  <demerzel_> i /think/ STD_INPUT_HANDLE is workable in linux
2010-11-09T13:36:55  <mega1> have you solved it?
2010-11-09T13:36:59  <demerzel_> at least i'm finding examples of it
2010-11-09T13:37:18  <demerzel_> i solved it by basically defining my own stdin/stdout via GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE)

2010-11-09T14:38:11  <demerzel_> i cannot believe out of all the shit i've done that is what is going to push me to c++
2010-11-09T14:38:24  <lavalamp_> amin10043 if you can describe your problem you will get more responses
2010-11-09T14:38:33  <amin10043> ok, sure
2010-11-09T14:38:53  <amin10043> i want to call IssueOrder in a loop
2010-11-09T14:39:21  <amin10043> after call IssueOrder , call FinishTurn immediately
2010-11-09T14:39:30  <lavalamp_> demerzel_, once in college I got totally stuck on an assignment because I didn't understand why I needed copy constructors... so much frustration for such a simple problem... :(
2010-11-09T14:39:37  <amin10043> but it's not work
2010-11-09T14:40:00  <lavalamp_> amin10043, no, you can only call FinishTurn when you're all done issuing orders for your turn
2010-11-09T14:40:42  <amin10043> ok, so how to move from all my planet in one time
2010-11-09T14:41:10  <lavalamp_> amin10043: you call IssueOrder N times. You call FinishTurn 1 time.
2010-11-09T14:41:19  <JamesMG> IssueOrder();IssueOrder();FinishTurn();
2010-11-09T14:41:21  <amin10043> i need multi threading
2010-11-09T14:41:40  <lavalamp_> amin10043: no you don't
2010-11-09T14:41:51  <lavalamp_> and it's not allowed, anyway
2010-11-09T14:42:03  <amin10043> i don't know how ?!
2010-11-09T14:42:22  <lavalamp_> amin10043 maybe you should pastebin your code because we clearly aren't communicating at all
2010-11-09T14:42:27  <lavalamp_> pastebin.com
2010-11-09T14:42:41  <amin10043> when i use IssueOrder in loop , no moving happen in runtime
2010-11-09T14:43:00  <lavalamp_> does your loop ever end?
2010-11-09T14:43:32  <amin10043> yeeeees
2010-11-09T14:43:43  <amin10043> for (Planet p : pw.MyPlanets())
2010-11-09T14:43:48  <amin10043> this is my loop
2010-11-09T14:44:29  <lavalamp_> amin10043 there are any number of things you could be doing wrong
2010-11-09T14:44:47  <amin10043> what ?
2010-11-09T14:44:52  <lavalamp_> without a better description and/or seeing some of your code it is really hard for us to help
2010-11-09T14:44:57  <demerzel_> lavalamp_ i've never used copy constructors but shallow copies are usually fine by me haha
2010-11-09T14:45:39  <lavalamp_> demerzel_ not if you have private, allocated data and don't realize you accidentally made some temporary copies...
2010-11-09T14:45:49  <demerzel_> oic
2010-11-09T14:45:49  <amin10043> hey ...
2010-11-09T14:45:56  <lavalamp_> yes?

2010-11-09T14:46:39  <lavalamp_> amin10043, you could be: timing out, crashing, sending more ships than you have, sending ships to an invalid planet... the list goes on
2010-11-09T14:47:05  <amin10043> no one !
2010-11-09T14:47:30  <p4p4> demerzel_, why undergo all this pain ? can't you just use the c++ input, compile as c++ and still do everything in c from there on ?
2010-11-09T14:47:47  <lavalamp_> amin10043, if you post your code on pastebin, I will look at it. Otherwise I don't think this is a very productive conversation.
2010-11-09T14:47:51  <amin10043> hey , can i describe ?
2010-11-09T14:47:55  <demerzel_> of course -- i could just use python too
2010-11-09T14:48:02  <demerzel_> i am actually bout to do that tbh tho
2010-11-09T14:48:02  <amin10043> okey
2010-11-09T14:48:32  <jmcarthur> deep copies are not necessary when you restrict yourself to immutable data :)
2010-11-09T14:48:39  <demerzel_> i found it in an old tron bot
2010-11-09T14:48:41  <demerzel_> if (!((r = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_GETFL)) & O_NONBLOCK)) 		fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, r | O_NONBLOCK);
2010-11-09T14:48:47  <demerzel_> that should do me
2010-11-09T14:49:14  <lavalamp_> demerzel_ good thinking

2010-11-09T14:50:36  <JamesMG> amin10043: verify that dest is not null in getNearest
2010-11-09T14:51:03  <JamesMG> or if it returns null do not issue an order with source == null

2010-11-09T14:52:12  <demerzel_> jmcarthur: same
2010-11-09T14:52:18  <jmcarthur> it's one thing to have a catch-all at the top level. it's another to not even report it
2010-11-09T14:52:21  <demerzel_> first time i saw that i thought 'yea by your shitty code'
2010-11-09T14:52:40  <demerzel_> catchall at top level is good
2010-11-09T14:52:45  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-11-09T14:52:46  <demerzel_> just make it say 'go\n' lol

2010-11-09T14:53:37  <amin10043> no , it's successful
2010-11-09T14:53:51  <amin10043> why it's seems wrong ?
2010-11-09T14:54:34  <lavalamp_> amin10043: your code is not obviously wrong. Your problem, whatever it is, has nothing to do with calling issueorder in a loop.

2010-11-09T14:54:50  <lavalamp_> you will have to debug it to see what is going wrong.
2010-11-09T14:55:17  <amin10043> it's another problem, :) how can i debug java code ?!
2010-11-09T14:55:28  <demerzel_> p4p4 ??

2010-11-09T15:00:40  <phreeza> quite
2010-11-09T15:00:53  <demerzel_> c++ was cool in 95 now there are better languages
2010-11-09T15:01:02  <demerzel_> for that kind of programming at least
2010-11-09T15:01:33  <demerzel_> i LIKE pedantic languages for a reason ;)
2010-11-09T15:01:35  <phreeza> for what kind of programming?
2010-11-09T15:01:45  <janstaunton> painful?
2010-11-09T15:01:55  <demerzel_> no because it either works or it doesn't
2010-11-09T15:01:59  <demerzel_> not hidden away in some implementation
2010-11-09T15:02:00  <janstaunton> :D
2010-11-09T15:02:07  <phreeza> c++ is pretty pedantic
2010-11-09T15:02:11  <phreeza> imho
2010-11-09T15:02:17  <demerzel_> compared to python maybe
2010-11-09T15:02:23  <phreeza> yes :)
2010-11-09T15:02:41  <demerzel_> but then again every language qualifies there
2010-11-09T15:02:59  <demerzel_> except maybe vbscript ;)
2010-11-09T15:04:28  <phreeza> ruby, perl... don't they all have duck typing?
2010-11-09T15:04:52  <phreeza> oh and then theres Javascript, that tries to match {} if you happen to forget one :D
2010-11-09T15:05:33  <lavalamp_> js guesses about ; too, I think

2010-11-09T16:26:51  <janstaunton> yeah they should see it coming
2010-11-09T16:26:57  <janstaunton> They would easily dominate the aggressors
2010-11-09T16:27:07  <JamesMG> I can't tell if it's mono or hardware, but on my laptop the gamestate that timed me out on official takes .25s :(
2010-11-09T16:27:11  <janstaunton> I wish I was playing as neutral :(
2010-11-09T16:27:16  <JamesMG> linux desktop takes a second though
2010-11-09T16:27:51  <janstaunton> brb roasting some monkey nuts
2010-11-09T16:28:03  <JamesMG> the monkeys must hate you
2010-11-09T16:29:04  <lavalamp_> fried tastes just as good and takes less time :P
2010-11-09T16:29:21  <janstaunton> Seriously? You can fry monkey nuts? :)
2010-11-09T16:30:42  <lavalamp_> can't you fry anything?
2010-11-09T16:30:53  <janstaunton> I suppose with some caramelised sugar you are sorted!
2010-11-09T16:36:40  <d0ugal> yuck.
2010-11-09T16:37:05  <JamesMG> fried icecream is pretty decent
2010-11-09T16:37:20  <JamesMG> perhaps heartstoppingly so

2010-11-09T16:46:20  <lavalamp_> wait there's an actual product called monkey nuts?
2010-11-09T16:47:12  <lavalamp_> d0ugal I think in addition to that the top 100 will play a round robin but who knows, it's hard to get a straight answer
2010-11-09T16:47:18  <d0ugal> lavalamp_: A product of nature even.
2010-11-09T16:47:29  <lavalamp_> O.O
2010-11-09T16:47:39  <d0ugal> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut - Peanuts are known by many other local names, like earthnuts, ground nuts, goober peas, monkey nuts, pygmy nuts and pig nuts.
2010-11-09T16:47:59  <d0ugal> I certainly didn't know most of them, but we call 'em monkey nuts here.
2010-11-09T16:48:13  <d0ugal> lavalamp_: It'll be interesting to see the final 100 battle it out
2010-11-09T16:48:14  <lavalamp_> ah thanks, lol
2010-11-09T16:48:36  <d0ugal> I hope some people will release code and/or articles about their bots. I'd love to learn and see how other people are doin' it
2010-11-09T16:48:37  <lavalamp_> we should make a betting pool on how many bocsimacko will lose if they do that
2010-11-09T16:49:44  <janstaunton> mmmmm deese nuts are nice
2010-11-09T16:49:47  <janstaunton> Need some seasoning tho

2010-11-09T18:12:04  <brx> i thoroughly enjoyed mega1's post on UCT for tron. i share those sentiments regarding public discussion of strategies / algorithms. there's a sense of panic within whenever i read someone in here or on the forums skirt around ideas I want to try. :)

2010-11-09T18:13:26  <phreeza> as often in life, ideas are a dime a dozen, implementing well is what matters most, I think
2010-11-09T18:13:40  <phreeza> and picking the good ideas, maybe
2010-11-09T18:13:49  <phreeza> but mostly execution
2010-11-09T18:14:20  <brx> that's true, of course.

2010-11-09T18:31:39  <phreeza> do you?
2010-11-09T18:31:46  <sigh> yeah, it's a lot easier and more fun to learn if you have other people starting with you
2010-11-09T18:31:56  <sigh> yeah, not so much recently though
2010-11-09T18:31:58  <phreeza> i bet
2010-11-09T18:32:31  <phreeza> whats your handicap? i forget the fancy japanese word :D
2010-11-09T18:33:01  <sigh> I used to be able to hold a 4d on KGS
2010-11-09T18:33:07  <sigh> 4d rank
2010-11-09T18:33:31  <phreeza> aha so if you play against a total beginner you give him 4 stones?
2010-11-09T18:34:14  <sigh> no... ranks go from ~30 kyu to 1k then 1 dan to ~7 d
2010-11-09T18:34:33  <sigh> well, more like ~9 usually
2010-11-09T18:34:48  <phreeza> ah wow
2010-11-09T18:34:52  <phreeza> so thats pretty good
2010-11-09T18:35:48  <sigh> it's not bad... but improvement in the dan ranks is hard :)
2010-11-09T18:35:58  <phreeza> Advanced amateur according to wikipedia
2010-11-09T18:35:58  <sigh> so there is a *very* large difference from where I am to the top

2010-11-09T18:41:58  <phreeza> thats what i find really interesting
2010-11-09T18:42:03  <phreeza> in chess too
2010-11-09T18:42:16  <phreeza> eliminate the chance for tactical blunders
2010-11-09T18:42:30  <sigh> I suspect for go the human would find it frustrating, computer style is VERY different to human style

2010-11-09T21:28:12  <demerzel> well here's what actually works in windows - using the STD_INPUT_HANDLE which is a DWORD -12 and freading it

2010-11-09T21:44:25  <lavalamp__> antimatroid1, it passes you planets, then fleets, then the word "go"
2010-11-09T21:44:38  <lavalamp__> the spec page spells it out pretty clearly, I thought
2010-11-09T21:44:39  <antimatroid1> oh shit, so it is just like that
2010-11-09T21:44:51  <lavalamp__> ^^
2010-11-09T21:44:51  <antimatroid1> yeah, it does, sorry
2010-11-09T21:45:11  <antimatroid1> okay, so just read line till i receive go then bam
2010-11-09T21:48:16  <demerzel> i just look for 'g'
2010-11-09T21:48:26  <demerzel> it's either P F or g
2010-11-09T21:48:29  <demerzel> or I if you're on tcp
2010-11-09T21:48:34  <antimatroid1> yeah i just changed that
2010-11-09T21:48:56  <antimatroid1> i like to be able to look at something and know what it's doing
2010-11-09T21:49:07  <antimatroid1> i removed all those tokenize functions / classes last night
2010-11-09T21:49:09  <antimatroid1> they were horrible
2010-11-09T21:51:51  <demerzel> yea it's amazingly easy in C
2010-11-09T21:51:58  <demerzel> i fscanf(stdin line
2010-11-09T21:52:10  <demerzel> 1 even
2010-11-09T21:52:25  <demerzel> same with any C really though i dno't know they went with tokenize
2010-11-09T21:55:45  <Error323> this is just hilarious http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=934189
2010-11-09T21:55:50  <Error323> talk about comeback
2010-11-09T21:56:01  <lavalamp__> it's amazingly easy... says the guy who's spent hours trying to get it to work >.<
2010-11-09T21:57:39  <demerzel> yea no shit
2010-11-09T21:57:47  <lavalamp__> Error323 that's impossible
2010-11-09T21:57:49  <demerzel> i am totally baffled at how goddamn ridiculously hard this is
2010-11-09T21:57:57  <demerzel> more so that there isn't a quick google solution
2010-11-09T21:58:21  <lavalamp__> yeah....
2010-11-09T21:59:05  <demerzel> i've been coding in different languages for over a decade and i've never hit a brick wall like this
2010-11-09T21:59:18  <demerzel> it'd be different if i had no idea what stdin was or how files worked in C
2010-11-09T21:59:36  <demerzel> now it's turned into a MISSION
2010-11-09T22:00:42  <demerzel> i wish dhartmei was around i'd ask him about his c code from tron

2010-11-09T22:01:32  <lavalamp__> isn't his code open source?
2010-11-09T22:01:42  <lavalamp__> tron was a while ago ^^
2010-11-09T22:02:01  <demerzel> yea i have the link to it
2010-11-09T22:02:05  <demerzel> unfortunately i don't udnerstand it
2010-11-09T22:02:13  <lavalamp__> link me?
2010-11-09T22:02:19  <demerzel> he's got some kind of fcntl fd_set thing going on and part of it has async stuff
2010-11-09T22:02:37  <demerzel> http://www.benzedrine.cx/tron/tronbot/MyTronBot.cc
2010-11-09T22:04:45  <lavalamp__> I don't think that's async in the sense of multiple threads, he's just (potentially?) waiting on more than one file handle
2010-11-09T22:05:05  <demerzel> i have no idea
2010-11-09T22:05:14  <demerzel> i could copy it word for word but it wouldn't work in windows
2010-11-09T22:06:00  <demerzel> i want to know why raedwulf's code works and mine doesn't
2010-11-09T22:06:06  <demerzel> i copied his code directly lol
2010-11-09T22:07:22  <lavalamp__> hahaha that sucks
2010-11-09T22:07:39  <demerzel> his is literally just a looping fgets
2010-11-09T22:07:50  <demerzel> he said he 'had problems with it going too fast' so parsed right then and there
2010-11-09T22:07:58  <demerzel> and that was literally it
2010-11-09T22:08:21  <demerzel> i already parse and on top of that assign values to structs so idk wtf

2010-11-09T22:10:24  <antimatroid1> i once had a game where our ships count graph was a near perfect polynomial
2010-11-09T22:10:35  <antimatroid1> like, way less noise than that one

2010-11-09T22:10:52  <demerzel> he's treating stdin like a socket somehow lol
2010-11-09T22:11:01  <lavalamp__> so you can compile raed's code and it works for you but not when you copy it? :/

2010-11-09T22:11:19  <demerzel> well his doesn't work for me for a variety of reasons - i don't know what some of his decs are
2010-11-09T22:11:27  <demerzel> it's very basic though
2010-11-09T22:11:30  <antimatroid1> i just completely changed my code for handling game state strings without hitch, i have no idea how you're having this much trouble

2010-11-09T22:11:42  <demerzel> i can't read stdin anti
2010-11-09T22:11:46  <lavalamp__> on unix each file (socket, pipe-- all the same) gets a number, fdset is a bitarray of them
2010-11-09T22:11:50  <demerzel> are you vanilla C?  i'd like to see your stdin
2010-11-09T22:12:27  <demerzel> it complicates the issue that what might fix it in windows won't in linux and vice versa and i have no way to test in linux other than just blindly uploading
2010-11-09T22:12:49  <lavalamp__> never got that virtualbox setup?
2010-11-09T22:13:07  <antimatroid1> mines in c++ and i'm using windows
2010-11-09T22:13:19  <antimatroid1> i'm still cleaning it up a bit, then i'll post what i did for you
2010-11-09T22:14:00  <demerzel> well if its cin << std::string then don't worry about it but if it's using C stuff i'd like to see it
2010-11-09T22:14:25  <demerzel> lavalamp_ - there is no way it would be like a good 4-5 hour learning experience plus i have no idea how i would setu p an engine etc etc
2010-11-09T22:15:03  <antimatroid1> i'm just using getline and passing cin as an input stream
2010-11-09T22:15:31  <antimatroid1> that's to construct the map_data string, for passgamestate i'm using string streams

2010-11-09T22:16:22  <antimatroid1> we did our tron bot trying to use mostly just c, but it ended up being way too messy to be worthwhile imo
2010-11-09T22:19:11  <demerzel> well i've got full-on tcp socket code, nodes, parsing etc already setu p in C

2010-11-09T22:19:29  <lavalamp__> demerzel, does that work for you?
2010-11-09T22:19:40  <demerzel> no fgets just freezes
2010-11-09T22:20:03  <demerzel> i mean i'll try it
2010-11-09T22:20:19  <demerzel> but it never works - i would say a windows thing but fgets was in the version i uploaded to the main server
2010-11-09T22:20:43  <lavalamp__> hm that works fine for me, typing and piping
2010-11-09T22:21:14  <lavalamp__> maybe you have some problem other than reading?
2010-11-09T22:21:28  <sigh> is *everyone* rewriting the io code?
2010-11-09T22:21:53  <lavalamp__> sigh, all the cool kids are doing it
2010-11-09T22:21:59  <antimatroid1> sigh: imo it really doesn't matter, i just did it for aesthetic purposes
2010-11-09T22:22:09  <lavalamp__> I rewrote it only because I did the go starter package...
2010-11-09T22:22:23  <sigh> yeah, well that actually makes sense :P
2010-11-09T22:22:41  <antimatroid1> what i do makes sense in the fact that what i do hardly ever makes sense
2010-11-09T22:22:41  <sigh> what got you interested in go lang, anyway?
2010-11-09T22:23:02  <demerzel> i rewrote it in all the other ones thsi is the only one that makes any problem lol
2010-11-09T22:23:43  <lavalamp__> well the name at first, obviously ^^
2010-11-09T22:24:09  <sigh> :P
2010-11-09T22:24:11  <lavalamp__> but then I decided to learn it (in the process made dailyjoseki.com) and it turned out I really like it

2010-11-09T22:42:09  <demerzel> it doesn't do jack except go
2010-11-09T22:42:23  <demerzel> anyway i just plugged in c++ for one line and it works now
2010-11-09T22:42:24  <demerzel> how frustrating
2010-11-09T22:42:37  <demerzel> i am tired of dicking with it

2010-11-09T22:43:41  <lavalamp__> is this what you did?
2010-11-09T22:45:00  <lavalamp__> wait, that doesn't work locally
2010-11-09T22:45:37  <lavalamp__> ....weird
2010-11-09T22:46:07  <lavalamp__> it works when I cat file | it, and when I type at it, but not from jbotman
2010-11-09T22:46:46  <demerzel> no i don't use strcmp just check first char for 10
2010-11-09T22:46:48  <demerzel> '\n'
2010-11-09T22:47:47  <demerzel> haha and now it works
2010-11-09T22:47:49  <demerzel> how fucking stupid
2010-11-09T22:48:10  <demerzel> whatever i think i managed to burn myself out lo
2010-11-09T22:49:08  <lavalamp__> wait that works for you?
2010-11-09T22:49:12  <lavalamp__> lol now it doesn't work for me
2010-11-09T22:49:16  <demerzel> no not that
2010-11-09T22:49:27  <demerzel> i plugged in C++ for one line - cin.getline(io_input)
2010-11-09T22:49:29  <demerzel> and it works
