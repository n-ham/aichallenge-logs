2012-08-11T09:39:25  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: we specifically do market making and arbitrage, but the contest wouldn't have to be that in particular. unlike what we do, the participants in the contest would be fully automated bots. there's a fair bit of ai required there. i don't know how much game theory can be applied, not because it's not applicable but because the number of variables is just so high
2012-08-11T09:39:55  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: we have trading systems, but they are controlled by traders
2012-08-11T09:40:26  <antimatroid1> any ideas on how extravagant they get with their strategies? :P
2012-08-11T09:40:50  <jmcarthur> hft doesn't get very extravagent since they have to go so fast. we get pretty fancy
2012-08-11T09:41:06  <jmcarthur> esp. with arbitrage
2012-08-11T09:42:18  <antimatroid1> i'm just trying to find the thing on wiki that sounds awesome to me :P
2012-08-11T09:42:47  <jmcarthur> it's kind of like playing poker, in many ways
2012-08-11T09:43:46  <antimatroid1> yeah, that kind of work sounds really fun to me
2012-08-11T09:43:49  <jmcarthur> if you can come up with an estimated value for a trade (which is hard) then you can decide whether to take it
2012-08-11T09:43:53  <antimatroid1> the hft stuff not so much
2012-08-11T09:44:29  <antimatroid1> i'm hoping optiver in australia do some stuff like that and maybe they'll take me once i'm done with the phd
2012-08-11T09:45:52  <jmcarthur> jane street doesn't require phds!
2012-08-11T09:46:15  <antimatroid1> i can't find this page :\
2012-08-11T09:46:30  <jmcarthur> what page?
2012-08-11T09:46:36  <antimatroid1> i am doing the phd in something which i doubt would be useful for finance anyway, i just want to do it :D
2012-08-11T09:46:42  <antimatroid1> on wikipedia
2012-08-11T09:46:52  <jmcarthur> oh optiver is hft
2012-08-11T09:47:07  <jmcarthur> i work next to a biology phd
2012-08-11T09:47:26  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i don't know much about trading etc. that's part of what i am hoping to teach myself during phd
2012-08-11T09:47:49  <antimatroid1> i did measure and probability courses last semester
2012-08-11T09:47:54  <jmcarthur> heh, in fact jane street doesn't expect any prior knowledge about finance
2012-08-11T09:48:04  <antimatroid1> i thought that had largely changed?
2012-08-11T09:48:16  <antimatroid1> since there's now so many candidates trained in both, why train people on their own dime?
2012-08-11T09:48:40  <jmcarthur> that may have changed in the rest of the industry, but not here
2012-08-11T09:48:49  <antimatroid1> my thoughts are based off internet comments though, so yeah, :P
2012-08-11T09:49:03  <jmcarthur> the reason is that we have a pretty different culture from the rest, and we find that many candidates with any experience are already "broken" :\
2012-08-11T09:49:23  <jmcarthur> well, *a* reason
2012-08-11T09:49:30  <antimatroid1> define broken in this context?
2012-08-11T09:50:01  <antimatroid1> i assume you're also working with haskell knowing you?
2012-08-11T09:50:58  <jmcarthur> don't have many of their own opinions, both technically and ethically; tend to expect a pretty rigid corporate structure and don't know what to do with autonomy; have certain expectations about what we do and do not like employees doing; etc.
2012-08-11T09:51:06  <jmcarthur> ocaml
2012-08-11T09:51:51  <jmcarthur> i would say ethics is one of the bigger things
2012-08-11T09:52:23  <jmcarthur> people from other parts of the finance industry are kind of prone to lying, unfortunately... they think they are just white lies that everybody says, but...
2012-08-11T09:52:28  <antimatroid1> i'm painfully ethical at times
2012-08-11T09:52:54  <antimatroid1> sounds like you've got a pretty sweet gig going
2012-08-11T09:53:14  <jmcarthur> one of the cofounders says that if good people never enter get into finance, there will be no good people in finance
2012-08-11T09:53:20  <jmcarthur> *never get
2012-08-11T09:54:36  <antimatroid1> i'm actually making liveable money at the moment anyway, so i'm set for another ~3 years
2012-08-11T09:54:51  <jmcarthur> great!
2012-08-11T09:54:54  <antimatroid1> getting 24k tax free funding and up to $110/h TAing
2012-08-11T09:55:12  <antimatroid1> not raking it in, but my expenses are minimal so it's slowly backing up
2012-08-11T09:55:23  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's how i treat money, too
2012-08-11T09:56:33  <jmcarthur> my wife and i lived on 12k USD for a year without lowering our prior standard of living, and this in fact included some other expenses like traveling and moving...
2012-08-11T09:56:46  <antimatroid1> nice
2012-08-11T09:56:58  <antimatroid1> i've never really been outside australia (went to nz when i was like 4)
2012-08-11T09:57:06  <antimatroid1> i might take a chunck out for a trip next year or something
2012-08-11T09:57:35  <antimatroid1> so far this year i've just been getting on top of the phd stuff rather than being in a huge rush at the end
2012-08-11T10:00:31  <jmcarthur> one of my coworkers actually started jane street before finishing his phd, but then decided he wanted to finish it, so he's on a hiatus to finish it up... i think it's taking him a lot longer than he planned to write his thesis
2012-08-11T10:04:36  <antimatroid1> yeah i want to finish the phd at least before i consider moving outside academia
2012-08-11T10:04:43  <antimatroid1> i may even do a post doc first
2012-08-11T10:04:58  <antimatroid1> if i had my first pick of jobs through my life i'd do that, finance for a while then go back to academia
2012-08-11T10:26:40  <jmcarthur> i have no particular long term goal, apart perhaps from early retirement, although so far that hasn't been the explicit goal. i've just been saving way more than i have to
2012-08-11T10:26:53  <jmcarthur> but if i do retire early then i get to work on whatever i want :D
2012-08-11T10:27:21  <jmcarthur> i guess i also have some vague plans to be an entrepreneur at some point
2012-08-11T10:31:04  <antimatroid1> retiring early would be nice
2012-08-11T10:31:30  <antimatroid1> and just being financially secure
2012-08-11T10:31:34  <antimatroid1> so you're free to do whatever you want
2012-08-11T10:32:18  <antimatroid1> anyway, hockey bronze medal game is on and australia is playing :P

2012-08-11T15:08:35  <jmcarthur> mcstar: heh
2012-08-11T15:08:54  <mcstar> it was a bad joke...
2012-08-11T15:09:04  <jmcarthur> that why it only gets a "heh"
2012-08-11T15:09:10  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-11T15:10:02  <mcstar> so, i read you would make a financial game for recruitment?
2012-08-11T15:10:22  <mcstar> how would that work? worldwide?
2012-08-11T15:11:03  <jmcarthur> well, by "for recruitment" i basically mean that the goals would be to get our name out there, showing that we do fun stuff, and to possibly find talent and such
2012-08-11T15:11:13  <jmcarthur> we are an international company, so yes
2012-08-11T15:11:38  <mcstar> do you have offices in hungary? i think not
2012-08-11T15:12:00  <jmcarthur> we have three primary offices. we hire out of any country we can, though
2012-08-11T15:12:04  <amstan_> mcstar: international is usually defined as 3 or more
2012-08-11T15:12:06  <amstan_> 2*
2012-08-11T15:12:09  <amstan_> countries
2012-08-11T15:12:24  <mcstar> doesnt matter, i wanted to know specifically
2012-08-11T15:12:35  <mcstar> morgan stanly has offices here for example
2012-08-11T15:12:36  <jmcarthur> our main offices are in new york, london, hong kong
2012-08-11T15:12:54  <jmcarthur> new york being by far the largest and most central
2012-08-11T15:13:17  <jmcarthur> it's something like 220/60/40
2012-08-11T15:13:59  <mcstar> what are the numbers? employees?
2012-08-11T15:14:03  <jmcarthur> yeah
2012-08-11T15:14:27  <jmcarthur> that's a lower bound on each office, to be clear
2012-08-11T15:14:32  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure of the exact numbers
2012-08-11T15:15:06  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2012-08-11T15:18:29  <mcstar> those are surprisingly small numbers
2012-08-11T15:18:34  <mcstar> at least, i am surprised
2012-08-11T15:18:55  <jmcarthur> we're a prop shop, and not a spinoff some some larger company
2012-08-11T15:18:59  <jmcarthur> *from some
2012-08-11T15:19:26  <mcstar> how come youre usually on #haskell but not on #ocaml?
2012-08-11T15:19:41  <jmcarthur> as far as my own time goes, i still prefer haskell over ocaml ;)
2012-08-11T15:19:50  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-11T15:19:52  <jmcarthur> i've appears in #ocaml a few times, but i don't lurk
2012-08-11T15:19:56  <jmcarthur> *appeared
2012-08-11T15:20:56  <jmcarthur> we've grown a lot even since i was hired. we had barely over 200 people worldwide when i first started
2012-08-11T15:21:08  <mcstar> how do you do the actual hiring? call in a bunch of candidates, and select a few on the basis of some test and interview?
2012-08-11T15:21:32  <jmcarthur> normally we take resumes, do a few phone interviews, then bring them in for a day
2012-08-11T15:21:47  <jmcarthur> sometimes there are unusual cases, but that is by and large the norm
2012-08-11T15:22:12  <jmcarthur> we don't bring in several at once though. it's all one-on-one
2012-08-11T15:22:24  <mcstar> that was my next quetion :)
2012-08-11T15:22:25  <jmcarthur> well, we might have a few on-site at a time, but we don't test them together
2012-08-11T15:22:27  <mcstar> s
2012-08-11T15:22:51  <jmcarthur> actually, it's two-on-one (we normally have two interviewers at a time)
2012-08-11T15:22:55  <jmcarthur> except on the phone
2012-08-11T15:23:19  <mcstar> how many of the called-in candidates do you actually hire roughly?
2012-08-11T15:23:56  <mcstar> (i guess, you are free to pick, no shortage of candidates, right?)
2012-08-11T15:23:57  <jmcarthur> i don't remember that figure for certain
2012-08-11T15:24:28  <jmcarthur> i think we tend to hire 1% or 2% of all candidates we interview, but that probably includes people we reject before bringing on-site
2012-08-11T15:24:58  <jmcarthur> we always have more to do than we do employees
2012-08-11T15:25:45  <antimatroid1> how do i wake myself up for an hour?
2012-08-11T15:25:50  <jmcarthur> i think the 1-2% is of candidates that pass the resume screening
2012-08-11T15:25:50  <antimatroid1> i'm half asleep and the hockey final is on
2012-08-11T15:26:16  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: just an hour? slap yourself in the face every few minutes really hard
2012-08-11T15:26:17  <mcstar> antimatroid1: go outside in the cold for a while, or smoke a cigarette
2012-08-11T15:26:30  <antimatroid1> it's 5 degrees outside, fuck that
2012-08-11T15:26:36  <jmcarthur> it'd wake you up!
2012-08-11T15:26:37  * antimatroid1 slaps himself
2012-08-11T15:26:40  <jmcarthur> ha
2012-08-11T15:26:44  <mcstar> is that hot or cold? i never know..
2012-08-11T15:26:50  <antimatroid1> cold for me
2012-08-11T15:26:51  <jmcarthur> i think that's cold anywhere you are
2012-08-11T15:26:53  <mcstar> pussy
2012-08-11T15:26:57  <antimatroid1> cold enough for 5:30am
2012-08-11T15:27:44  <jmcarthur> if that were fahrenheite it would be damn cold
2012-08-11T15:28:00  <antimatroid1> i'm from australia, none of that funny stuff
2012-08-11T15:28:16  <antimatroid1> :p
2012-08-11T15:28:35  <mcstar> i just wasnt sure if he would find 5celsius too cold to go out(pussy!) or too hot to even bother with it
2012-08-11T15:28:50  <jmcarthur> mcstar: "(i guess, you are free to pick, no shortage of candidates, right?)"  actually, there is a shortage of candidates because we tend to be kind of selective
2012-08-11T15:29:44  <mcstar> yeah, you are definitely selective

2012-08-11T17:38:09  <mcstar> i dont even remember the avp movies
2012-08-11T17:38:21  <mcstar> they were somewhat bad, that i remember
2012-08-11T17:40:19  <mcstar> wiki says the first pc avp game has a linux version
2012-08-11T17:43:34  <mcstar> the port is incomplete :)
2012-08-11T17:43:36  <mcstar> :(
2012-08-11T17:49:58  <mleise> oh great ^^. well, Valve proved that OpenGL runs faster than DirectX and that Linux has is the same speed as Windows.
2012-08-11T17:50:41  <mleise> That means their corporate power will create a change in the next years and we will see AAA games on Linux
2012-08-11T17:51:25  <mleise> What I mean with that is, that they work closely with gfx card manufactureres to improve the drivers
2012-08-11T17:52:19  <mleise> heck, even the Windows OpenGL drivers got notably better through their intervention or that of id Software
2012-08-11T17:52:49  <mleise> an old ATi I had would render Doom3 with 2 FPS ... until a driver update. It's a shame -.-
2012-08-11T17:53:42  <mcstar> opengl has different performance across platforms?
2012-08-11T17:54:16  <mcstar> omg, Prometheus' buget was 130M$
2012-08-11T17:54:55  <mcstar> it was full of not-that-successful actors, except charlize theron

2012-08-11T17:58:35  <mleise> hey, if it sells ^^
2012-08-11T17:58:55  <mcstar> im just wondering who the f would read those
2012-08-11T17:59:50  <mcstar> maybe this kind of 'merging of universes' is common in the comics world, idk
2012-08-11T18:00:31  <mcstar> http://alienlovespredator.com/ this is good though
2012-08-11T18:11:01  <jmcarthur> the only one of those "vs" movies i've ever seen was freddy vs. jason... i don't know why the hell i watched it, though
2012-08-11T18:11:17  <jmcarthur> it was just stupid
2012-08-11T18:23:15  *** kilae <kilae!~chatzilla@catv-161-018.tbwil.ch> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.88.2 [Firefox 14.0.1/20120713134347])
2012-08-11T18:24:57  <mcstar> i dont know about that, but predators arent totally unrelated to aliens, since even in the original predator movies there was a hint for the xenomorph
2012-08-11T18:25:49  <mcstar> i think i saw something like that
2012-08-11T18:25:53  <mcstar> freddy kruger?
2012-08-11T18:26:19  <mcstar> i think he had an axe maybe?
2012-08-11T18:26:25  <mcstar> and jason had some sort of mask?
2012-08-11T18:26:31  <mcstar> and i remember water
2012-08-11T18:26:37  <mcstar> and a rowboat
2012-08-11T18:29:09  <mleise> silent hill 2 had water and a rowboat
2012-08-11T18:31:30  <mcstar> uh
2012-08-11T18:31:43  <mcstar> i really dont think i saw silent hill X
2012-08-11T18:31:56  <mcstar> i dont even know what freddy and jason is
2012-08-11T18:32:09  <mcstar> i think i saw that movie wo knowing the prequels
2012-08-11T18:32:34  <mcstar> but hey, maybe i know them, i saw a couple of scary movies!
2012-08-11T18:32:54  <mcstar> 1 2 3 maybe
2012-08-11T18:33:06  <mcstar> ah, im not sure
2012-08-11T18:33:23  <mcstar> it seems as if it happened in another lifetime
2012-08-11T18:40:15  <mleise> mcstar: i didn't mean the movie
2012-08-11T18:40:54  * mcstar supposes theres something else besides a movie called silent hill 2?
2012-08-11T18:41:11  <mcstar> book?
2012-08-11T18:41:17  <mleise> mcstar: it started out as a creepy PS1 game
2012-08-11T18:41:28  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-11T18:42:03  <mleise> survival horror in full 3D with a father looking for his daughter in a misty old town with strange things happening
2012-08-11T18:42:51  <mleise> it also featured several different paths and endings depending on what you did
2012-08-11T18:43:27  <mleise> by todays standards it is much too difficult though
2012-08-11T18:44:10  <mleise> you actually had to _keep_ moving to survive at most times.
2012-08-11T18:44:59  <mcstar> i didnt play with creepy games
2012-08-11T18:45:32  <mleise> alone in the dark 2 & 3 were also good
2012-08-11T18:45:34  <mcstar> except one, with some psichic component
2012-08-11T18:46:01  <mleise> It's the mix of shocking action and puzzle solving
2012-08-11T18:46:25  <mcstar> f.e.a.r.
2012-08-11T18:46:35  <mleise> had no puzzles
2012-08-11T18:47:03  <mleise> but I liked it, yeah. just a few weeks ago I collected the original + addons.
2012-08-11T18:47:17  <mcstar> i mean, that was the game i referred to
2012-08-11T18:47:23  <mleise> my personality also made me repackage it all to use up less disk space
2012-08-11T18:47:34  <mleise> now it is 3.7 GB in a 7zip file ^^
2012-08-11T18:47:35  <mcstar> i think i was bored, thats why i played it, it was a long time ago
2012-08-11T18:48:13  <mcstar> you packaged up, so that you wont unpack it to play with it, because it would take too much time?
2012-08-11T18:48:18  <mleise> yes, it was no sequel, an unknown developer... the kind of stuff you gonna play when you are bored
2012-08-11T18:48:47  <mleise> mcstar: too much time to play through or unpack?
2012-08-11T18:48:54  <mcstar> to unpack
2012-08-11T18:49:09  <mcstar> it would sound like a strategy that i would employ
2012-08-11T18:49:18  <mleise> hehe, well it is fast enough unfortunately
2012-08-11T18:49:34  <mcstar> for example when i wanted to come off urban terror, i frequently deleted the game
2012-08-11T18:49:40  <mleise> and i can burn it to a dvd to pass on to someone else
2012-08-11T18:50:03  <mleise> you deleted and resinstalled it over and over?
2012-08-11T18:50:18  <mcstar> well, you just unzip a zip file..
2012-08-11T18:50:20  <mcstar> not much to install
2012-08-11T18:50:22  <mcstar> but yeah
2012-08-11T18:50:34  <mcstar> sometimes i even deleted the archive
2012-08-11T18:50:40  <mleise> Oo
2012-08-11T18:50:45  <mcstar> so that it would take 1:45 hours to download it again
2012-08-11T18:51:02  <mleise> sometimes i want to throw my notebook out of the window for that reason
2012-08-11T18:51:15  <mcstar> another strategy is to make yourself banned on your favorite servers
2012-08-11T18:51:16  <mleise> you had leech access to a warez server?
2012-08-11T18:51:36  <mcstar> it is a free game
2012-08-11T18:51:59  <mcstar> sort of like a coutner strike clone
2012-08-11T18:52:04  <mcstar> but has unique features
2012-08-11T18:52:23  <mleise> mcstar: lol, I once said "Hey how did that sucker show up in my back? He had to run through our friggin spawn and noone got him?!"
2012-08-11T18:52:26  <mleise> --- kicked
2012-08-11T18:52:29  <mleise> banned
2012-08-11T18:52:44  <mleise> I didn't know urban terror was free
2012-08-11T18:52:53  <mcstar> like different gameplays, jumping off of walls, which breeds a totally different gameplay, and there is a stamina-meter, you can run really fast for a short time
2012-08-11T18:53:01  <mleise> well I played Day of Defeat. started when it was an independent mod
2012-08-11T18:53:10  <mcstar> and you can heal others/yourself, and it really is kind of better than css
2012-08-11T18:53:43  <mleise> same in DoD with the healing (plugin), stamina system, mountable machine guns and rocket launchers
2012-08-11T18:53:51  <mleise> objectives other than bombs ^^
2012-08-11T18:53:52  <mcstar> http://www.urbanterror.info/home/
2012-08-11T18:54:07  <mcstar> this is kind of a precision game
2012-08-11T18:54:26  <mcstar> i mean, nothing like unreal tournament
2012-08-11T18:54:38  <mcstar> ofc, some say that is a precision game too
2012-08-11T18:55:02  <mcstar> i DONT uderstand those who play that game and clones
2012-08-11T18:55:14  <mcstar> the whole gameplay is a big mess
2012-08-11T18:55:22  <mcstar> but urt is really nice
2012-08-11T18:55:27  <mcstar> i was a pretty good sniper
2012-08-11T18:55:47  <mcstar> i most loved my flick-shots
2012-08-11T18:55:50  <mleise> i was never good as a sniper
2012-08-11T18:56:24  <mleise> i prefer rushing in and surprising the enemy
2012-08-11T18:57:21  <mcstar> i think i had a 100K kills in that game all in all
2012-08-11T18:57:44  <mcstar> i played it for 2 years i think
2012-08-11T18:57:44  <mleise> did the game keep track?
2012-08-11T18:57:52  <mcstar> some servers do
2012-08-11T18:58:52  <mleise> well the graphics are comparable I think. while quakeIII has the nice bezier curve elements, the half-life engine has more accurate light maps
2012-08-11T19:00:04  <mleise> I just don't like those modern shooters too much, don't know why
2012-08-11T19:00:33  <mleise> i mean online games with modern weapons or sci-fi setting
2012-08-11T19:00:34  <mcstar> i messed with ioquake3's source for a couple of days
2012-08-11T19:01:01  <mleise> i looked at the hl2 leaked source code for a few minutes
2012-08-11T19:01:17  <mcstar> i added a wallhack
2012-08-11T19:01:27  <mleise> uh oh
2012-08-11T19:01:41  <mcstar> and changed the identification to exploit a leak in b3
2012-08-11T19:01:53  <mcstar> thats the usual server admin software of urt
2012-08-11T19:02:04  <mcstar> well, not leak
2012-08-11T19:02:09  <mcstar> a vulnerability
2012-08-11T19:02:10  <mleise> leak in b3 ???
2012-08-11T19:03:08  <mcstar> yeah, if the identification string was of a certain kind, i could fool b3 that im bot, and not joined online
2012-08-11T19:03:10  <mleise> i only once hacked a dll. someone in a hl1 stargate mod forum asked if the bullet shells could stay longer.
2012-08-11T19:03:35  <mcstar> oh, this wasnt binary hack
2012-08-11T19:03:36  <mleise> so i estimated the bullet fade time to 0,5 seconds and looked that up in the client dll as a float
2012-08-11T19:03:57  <mleise> changed it to a few minutes, shot 50 bullets and got 8 FPS ^^
2012-08-11T19:04:18  <mcstar> i changed urt's source, (b3 is written in python mostly, so it was easy to read)
2012-08-11T19:04:50  <mcstar> so what was the poit? slow down the scene?
2012-08-11T19:04:58  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-11T19:05:08  <mcstar> just the shells stay visible longer?
2012-08-11T19:06:12  <mcstar> anyway, i dont ever want to play this kind of game again
2012-08-11T19:06:27  <mcstar> it was a big effort to come clean
2012-08-11T19:06:31  <mleise> yes, someone thought it would look good
2012-08-11T19:08:01  <mleise> so you are a h4xx0r
2012-08-11T19:09:03  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-11T19:09:07  <mcstar> not a good one
2012-08-11T19:09:55  <mcstar> i really hated cheaters
2012-08-11T19:10:01  <mleise> so what did you do as a bot?
2012-08-11T19:10:09  <mcstar> nothing
2012-08-11T19:10:26  <mcstar> the point was, for the admin to not be able to kick me
2012-08-11T19:10:36  <mleise> ahahaa
2012-08-11T19:10:38  <mcstar> the sory went like this:
2012-08-11T19:10:40  <mcstar> story*
2012-08-11T19:10:42  <mleise> great
2012-08-11T19:10:49  <mcstar> i spent a lot of time on a server
2012-08-11T19:10:59  <mcstar> after some time, i was made a moderator
2012-08-11T19:11:16  <mcstar> once the owner had a really bad day or something
2012-08-11T19:11:32  <mcstar> and i asked about why he kicked someone
2012-08-11T19:11:36  <mcstar> i think
2012-08-11T19:11:44  <mcstar> and the result was, that he kicked me
2012-08-11T19:12:01  <mcstar> and thats not the sort of thing that i take lightly
2012-08-11T19:12:13  <mleise> and noone kicks you without reason
2012-08-11T19:12:22  <mcstar> i mean, i knew i had to take revenge of some sorts
2012-08-11T19:12:34  <mleise> O:-)
2012-08-11T19:13:07  <mcstar> remember, i was a moderator, i was playing nicely, and asked for a justification for the owner's action
2012-08-11T19:13:14  <mcstar> that guy is an idiot
2012-08-11T19:13:30  <mcstar> he really enjoys being GOD
2012-08-11T19:13:44  <mcstar> anyway, i immediately terminated my play there
2012-08-11T19:14:49  <mcstar> my reasoning was this: if i can fool the system that im a bot, and not joined from the outside, then my ip address wouldnt be the right one
2012-08-11T19:14:58  <mcstar> and he couldnt ban me even if he tried
2012-08-11T19:15:16  <mcstar> a better thing would have been to fake HIS ip address
2012-08-11T19:15:22  <mleise> lol, tried to fake *his* ip?
2012-08-11T19:15:27  <mcstar> so when he tries to ban me, he would ban himself
2012-08-11T19:15:36  <mleise> yes yes!!!!
2012-08-11T19:15:45  <mleise> eherm... cool down
2012-08-11T19:15:48  <mcstar> im just a scriptkiddie for that...
2012-08-11T19:15:55  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-11T19:16:22  <mleise> remember that internet joke about someone saying his ip is 127.0.0.1 and noone is smart enough to hack him?
2012-08-11T19:16:37  <mcstar> no
2012-08-11T19:16:46  <mcstar> i mean, i havent heard it
