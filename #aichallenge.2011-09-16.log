2011-09-16T05:57:39  <delt0r__> mleise: I default to a work Ant file
2011-09-16T05:58:03  <delt0r__> then its build tool "agnostic" at least as much as java is concerned
2011-09-16T05:58:05  <mleise> a work(ing) build.xml?
2011-09-16T05:58:10  <delt0r__> yea
2011-09-16T05:58:33  <delt0r__> all the main ide should import ok
2011-09-16T05:58:41  <delt0r__> I don't know why its not working for me
2011-09-16T05:58:47  <mleise> Yes, is included. But when you want to edit stuff and have the correct imports and so on, it could be handy
2011-09-16T05:58:57  <delt0r__> seems they use the type varable TValue rather than T
2011-09-16T05:59:31  <delt0r__> well eclipse is suppose to import a ant file correctly to do all that
2011-09-16T05:59:45  <mleise> ha ... haha
2011-09-16T05:59:57  <delt0r__> but yea... eclipse folks will like it... i would just also have a ant build file
2011-09-16T06:00:15  <delt0r__> eclipse exports them from .project files btw
2011-09-16T06:00:21  <delt0r__> again ymmv
2011-09-16T06:00:38  <mleise> I download Rhino from the web so that's difficult for Eclipse to figure out ;)
2011-09-16T06:00:42  <delt0r__> NetBeans plays nicer with ant files --so i am told
2011-09-16T06:00:57  <delt0r__> please say you don't use Maven...
2011-09-16T06:01:02  <delt0r__> ;)
2011-09-16T06:01:05  <delt0r__> not a fan
2011-09-16T06:01:16  <mleise> I introduced Maven at work against protests of my boss
2011-09-16T06:01:25  <delt0r__> hate the dam thing
2011-09-16T06:01:33  <mleise> He refused to see the benefits ^^
2011-09-16T06:01:53  <delt0r__> almost as much as i hate maven trolls that go around telling everyone else they must use maven... cus they do
2011-09-16T06:01:55  <delt0r__> ;)
2011-09-16T06:02:11  <mleise> But the day we upgraded hibernate he understood
2011-09-16T06:02:16  <delt0r__> if its so wonderfull... We don't need to all support it!
2011-09-16T06:02:34  <delt0r__> aka the devs of packages etc
2011-09-16T06:03:06  <delt0r__> its not version management when  i have to do the work to "support" maven
2011-09-16T06:04:59  <mleise> It has contious integration and other goodies as extensions. It's not only about version management.
2011-09-16T06:06:48  <mleise> I found it to work well when someone checks out the project to a virgin environment as well and it would resolve and download all dependencies in Eclipse. Of course there are also things like the very verbose XML or unresolvable conflicts that turned me down a bit.
2011-09-16T06:07:50  <delt0r__> yea-- then why do all these "maven is awesome" fans troll ever man and his dog to "support" maven... I will not... deal with it... if it as good as you claim, i don't need to support it!
2011-09-16T06:08:21  <delt0r__> it more of the hack to dependency hell that is modern development... and imo is not the cure
2011-09-16T06:08:52  <delt0r__> So if that is ok.. then i am ok with maven folk... but they just don't let sleeping dogs lie
2011-09-16T06:09:09  <delt0r__> you can use... just don't try to make me use it
2011-09-16T06:20:40  <mleise> use it!
2011-09-16T06:21:34  <mleise> you cannot stop the future,
2011-09-16T06:21:59  <mleise> i don't even have it installed here :)
2011-09-16T06:22:07  <delt0r__> bloody maven trolls... :D
2011-09-16T06:23:04  <delt0r__> btw is there somewhere i can push a public git whatever... so McLeopold can just pull from it? without the setup pain of github
2011-09-16T06:23:38  <delt0r__> my uni give me a web page only...

2011-09-16T07:08:51  <delt0r_> ftw
2011-09-16T07:08:56  <mcstar> i used dyndns

2011-09-16T07:09:01  <mleise> That said, my ISP hasn't changed my IPv4 for ages
2011-09-16T07:09:04  <mcstar> but thats different
2011-09-16T07:09:17  <mcstar> i work from home
2011-09-16T07:09:36  <mcstar> if the isp gives me a new dhcp address all my connections become stale
2011-09-16T07:09:43  <mleise> yes I use dyndns as well. with an earlier ISP the router allowed me to schedule the disconnects for some time late at night
2011-09-16T07:09:47  <mcstar> fortunately this doesnt happen

2011-09-16T07:14:59  <mcstar> we have a local monopoly here, they keep the prices high, maybe when i get a job ill upgrade the connection

2011-09-16T07:16:19  <mleise> mcstar: we had a Telekom monopoly here, too. But they were forced to open up the market. :D
2011-09-16T07:17:01  <mleise> sir_macelon: hmm, there is some shade of orange that almost looks like yellow !
2011-09-16T07:18:14  <sir_macelon> mleise: I would rather see more bright colors since those dark ones are harder to keep track off with a dark background, just a suggestion
2011-09-16T07:18:41  <mcstar> mleise: the market is really open, but the lines are theirs, and other providers would have to rent the lines form them, so they dont come here providing cheap service because they cant make profit
2011-09-16T07:19:27  <mleise> yes, that's why I moved the dark blue already. I'll look over the colors once more. It seems I don't need to care about colors 10-26, because the ranking alorithm crashes with more than 9 players
2011-09-16T07:19:36  <sir_macelon> mleise: you could go on and try with some bright yellow instead of this dark blue and see how it looks
2011-09-16T07:22:29  <mleise> I used a scripted web page that displays all the colors on blue and brown background, to find good colors, but it didn't seem to work too well in praxis

2011-09-16T07:31:09  <delt0r_> oh and the patch is included
2011-09-16T07:45:46  <delt0r_> oh.. sorry its like 2 commits instead of one. I never typically bother fixing that sort of thing...just let git deal with it

2011-09-16T10:07:06  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold worker 198 is currently stuck trying to turn in the result of an 8 player game; I have a feeling it's just that more players are more likely to trigger the bug and there isn't a cutoff that is actually safe
2011-09-16T10:07:06  <contestbot> janzert: Ready to serve, my lord.
2011-09-16T10:09:04  <eashoka> anybody has an insight on the logic behind why this game was stopped at turn 255 ? looks bit odd to me. http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=180379&user=264
2011-09-16T10:10:18  <janzert> and worker 200 is stuck on a 7 player game
2011-09-16T10:16:49  <janzert> eashoka: it looks like the max turn time was set to 255 for that game
2011-09-16T10:20:20  <eashoka> janzert : ah ok. hopefully, the turn limit will be determined dynamically in the finals so odd results like that one can be avoided.
2011-09-16T10:20:34  <janzert> yes, that's the plan
2011-09-16T10:22:11  <janzert> well dynamically as in a per map basis, there will still be a hard turn limit for a game but the idea is that 95% (or whatever is chosen) of games will finish naturally within that limit
2011-09-16T10:23:24  <eashoka> janzert : yea, understood. A totally fool proof solution may not be feasible there, we need to save cpu time as well.
2011-09-16T10:23:59  <janzert> right, there are always going to be some games that just aren't going to end within reasonable lengths :(

2011-09-16T10:26:31  <eashoka> janzert :exactly. hopefully that will also encourage bots to do more fighting and resolve their differences among themselves, without taking chances by waiting till the cut off time to intervene.
2011-09-16T10:26:53  <eashoka> BTW, got a feature request. what do you think of this :
2011-09-16T10:28:27  <eashoka> displaying (in profile pages) the next game pairing and the map before it start, along with count down. that will add so much into suspense!
2011-09-16T10:29:04  <janzert> the pairings are basically generated on demand now and aren't really known ahead of time
2011-09-16T10:29:06  *** aerique <aerique!310225@xs8.xs4all.nl> has quit IRC (Quit: ...)
2011-09-16T10:29:25  <janzert> I suppose it could show what is in progress though
2011-09-16T10:30:20  <janzert> but that won't last terribly long so probably doesn't add much
2011-09-16T10:30:40  <eashoka> what about breaking a game into few sessions ?
2011-09-16T10:31:13  <janzert> you mean play X turns then come back later and play another X turns?
2011-09-16T10:31:26  <janzert> that would add a lot of complications
2011-09-16T10:32:42  <eashoka> rather than ppl waiting full time interval to see the total game, they get to see(say) the first half of it in wuick time. made to wait is supspense for 10 more minutes and then will be shown the second half. :-) .
2011-09-16T10:33:32  <janzert> seems like a fair bit of work for something that overall people are not going to like
2011-09-16T10:33:33  <eashoka> well, if it is really difficult for the worker to run few games in parallel (in chunks) then we can always fake it :-)
2011-09-16T10:33:57  <janzert> I don't think people will actually appreciate the added suspense ;)
2011-09-16T10:34:14  <eashoka> oh you think ppl will not like it ? trust me, they will like :-) it's like a regular basketball or football match
2011-09-16T10:34:53  <eashoka> ppl are used to have 2 halves of a match separated by a little break. :-)
2011-09-16T10:34:55  <janzert> not when they realize we are artificially withholding parts of the game to add it
2011-09-16T10:35:19  <eashoka> of course only if it doesn't add lot of additional last minute work for you guys.
2011-09-16T10:35:31  <eashoka> ok, take this scenario :
2011-09-16T10:35:54  <eashoka> I have to wait for an hour till my next game.
2011-09-16T10:36:59  <eashoka> so the worker execute first half of my game, save the state and moving on to the second half. letting me analyse and predict outcomes for the remaining 30 minutes
2011-09-16T10:37:32  <eashoka> which I will enjoy compared to being in total dark for an whole hour. think of the last few rounds in the final!
2011-09-16T10:38:11  <janzert> but think of this counter scenario: you upload your latest submission, it plays its first game after 10 minutes and crashes after turn 857, but you only get to see the game in 100 turn increments released every 5 minutes. Are you going to be really mad when you wait an extra 40 minutes to find out that your current submission has a bug?
2011-09-16T10:39:03  <janzert> I think the latter (mostly in less extreme variants) is going to be more common than the former
2011-09-16T10:40:30  <eashoka> janzert : I mean having only 2 halves of the game.
2011-09-16T10:41:15  <cichociemno> eashoka: not all people are funs of football;-) Most people would prefer to see entire game or nothing.
2011-09-16T10:41:27  <janzert> ok, it makes it less extreme but still has the same problem
2011-09-16T10:42:18  <janzert> you can go ahead and add an issue on the bug tracker requesting it if you want, but because of the work involved making it happen and debatable advantages I doubt it will happen
2011-09-16T10:43:06  <eashoka> of course, that's why I ran it through you first. no point loggin it if it doesn't pass the sanity check first. :-)
2011-09-16T10:43:34  <eashoka> but what I really meant was not to keep playesr waiting for extra time.
2011-09-16T10:44:22  <cichociemno> janzert: Some easy way to notifying people about latest games would be great. I mean something like RSS or status.php?player=1234 with text response just "2011:09:14 11:15".
2011-09-16T10:44:35  <janzert> breaking the actual running of the game into sections would be really hard
2011-09-16T10:44:43  <eashoka> instead of making them wait a full hour to see the total thing. show the first half in 30 minutes, and then the second half in another 30. that way they will at least have something to do in the second 30 minute period before results. at least that was the idea.
2011-09-16T10:45:13  <eashoka> jazert : ok, in that case, it wouldn't probably worth it.

2011-09-16T12:48:17  <mcstar> McLeopold: do you know a mechanism to pass multiple arguments to an interpreter on a shebang line?
2011-09-16T12:51:52  <McLeopold> in linux?
2011-09-16T12:51:59  <McLeopold> $@ or something
2011-09-16T12:52:55  <McLeopold> actually, that's the answer to a different question
2011-09-16T12:53:40  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-16T12:53:50  <mcstar> #!
2011-09-16T12:54:10  <mcstar> i dont know if you faced this problem but i just did
2011-09-16T12:54:21  <mcstar> if you give a program on the shebang line with full path
2011-09-16T12:54:30  <mcstar> all the parameters afterwards arent plit
2011-09-16T12:54:32  <mcstar> split*
2011-09-16T12:54:58  <mcstar> that means, the interpreter or program gets all the arguments in argv[1] as 1 string
2011-09-16T12:56:01  <mcstar> this is very lame :S
2011-09-16T12:58:21  <McLeopold> a shebang line should just work with arguments, what is your line?
2011-09-16T12:59:18  <mcstar> McLeopold: no it shouldnt, apparently not on linux
2011-09-16T12:59:27  <mcstar> there are some unixes where its ok
2011-09-16T12:59:54  <McLeopold> well, not with /usr/bin/env
2011-09-16T13:00:01  <McLeopold> try without that
2011-09-16T13:00:18  <mcstar> #!/usr/bin/ipython --qui=qt -i
2011-09-16T13:00:25  <mcstar> this doesnt work for example
2011-09-16T13:00:43  <mcstar> --gui
2011-09-16T13:01:21  <mcstar> ipython complains that it doesnt recognize the "--qui=qt -i" argument
2011-09-16T13:03:09  <McLeopold> can those options be set within the program?
2011-09-16T13:04:43  <mcstar> no
2011-09-16T13:05:00  <mcstar> -i is for interactive, after the script is run i want to use the interpreter
2011-09-16T13:05:09  <mcstar> and the gui controls the thread management
2011-09-16T13:05:18  <mcstar> without it i cant use mlab/mayavi
2011-09-16T13:05:33  <mcstar> the obvious solution is a wrapper bash script
2011-09-16T13:05:49  <mcstar> but still, its awkward, to have 2 scripts
2011-09-16T13:12:03  <janzert> shebang is only technically allowed one argument, some oses allow multiple though, I'm not sure which way linux comes down
2011-09-16T13:12:34  <McLeopold> mcstar: ipython has profiles, you might be able to use that
2011-09-16T13:12:42  <janzert> and the worker are stuck
2011-09-16T13:12:44  <McLeopold> linux is one
2011-09-16T13:12:53  <McLeopold> yeah, I noticed
2011-09-16T13:13:13  <McLeopold> so, do we have the details of the game they are trying to post?
2011-09-16T13:13:22  <janzert> one is stuck on an 8 player game and the other a 7 player
2011-09-16T13:13:26  <McLeopold> list of user_ids and rank?
2011-09-16T13:13:40  <janzert> just sec, I'm still logged in to both
2011-09-16T13:14:22  <McLeopold> so, posting a game results should just copy the json to the main server and report back
2011-09-16T13:14:40  <McLeopold> some other process should be processing the trueskill and updating the database
2011-09-16T13:15:04  <McLeopold> which means we should probably go back to using the manager and have it watch a directory for json files
2011-09-16T13:15:09  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/9KJcedSL
2011-09-16T13:16:24  <McLeopold> delt0r's patch was changing a single number from 100 to 5000
2011-09-16T13:16:28  <janzert> hmm, yeah. so don't have the script that accepts the result do any processing
2011-09-16T13:16:38  <McLeopold> right
2011-09-16T13:16:39  <janzert> I already changed that from 100 to 1000
2011-09-16T13:16:40  <McLeopold> more robust
2011-09-16T13:16:47  <janzert> on the version that is running on the server
2011-09-16T13:17:18  <janzert> bumping it to 5000 might make it a bit rarer that it's a problem but isn't going to fix it I don't think
2011-09-16T13:17:32  <janzert> at least I'm guessing it's the same change
2011-09-16T13:17:52  <McLeopold> yeah, it probably is
2011-09-16T13:18:16  <janzert> I never bothered checking it in since it wasn't really a fix
2011-09-16T13:18:27  <McLeopold> your pastebin didn't give me ranks
2011-09-16T13:18:52  <janzert> that's the json from the server, the worker doesn't get ranks and such
2011-09-16T13:18:57  <janzert> at least so far as I know
2011-09-16T13:20:06  <McLeopold> well, it does run the game, so it wouldn't be in the incoming json, but the outgoing json
2011-09-16T13:20:24  <janzert> ahh, that never gets logged
2011-09-16T13:20:46  <janzert> all that is logged is the hash
2011-09-16T13:21:25  <McLeopold> you need --debug to get it, I think
2011-09-16T13:21:40  <McLeopold> yeah, so if there are too many tie ranks, php takes too long
2011-09-16T13:21:57  <McLeopold> even at 8 players
2011-09-16T13:22:09  <janzert> even at 7 :}
2011-09-16T13:22:33  <McLeopold> even at 6...

2011-09-16T13:27:48  <janzert> hmm
2011-09-16T13:28:27  <janzert> if I change the draw probability to 10% the example that you checked in that crashes with a 1% draw probability works fine
2011-09-16T13:28:40  <janzert> maybe we should just up the draw probability?
2011-09-16T13:28:49  <janzert> I think 1% is too low anyway
2011-09-16T13:29:15  <McLeopold> it will be too low next week
2011-09-16T13:29:29  <McLeopold> it means sigma drops faster

2011-09-16T13:32:06  <janzert> even 1.5% works, 1.1% hits the 100 iterations
2011-09-16T13:33:08  <McLeopold> with the php implementation, it is easy to put the variables in the server_info.php
2011-09-16T13:33:20  * janzert nods
2011-09-16T13:33:22  <McLeopold> so we can adjust without compiling TSUpdate
2011-09-16T13:34:42  <janzert> did you adjust the beta server already?
2011-09-16T13:37:19  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-16T13:38:36  <janzert> want to me to manually adjust it now  just to see if the currently stuck games pass
2011-09-16T13:40:19  <McLeopold> sure
2011-09-16T13:40:38  <McLeopold> set it at 5% for now
2011-09-16T13:40:39  <janzert> ok, set to 5%
2011-09-16T13:41:02  <McLeopold> so, by stuck, does that mean the worker is downloading and playing the same matchup over and over?
2011-09-16T13:41:19  <janzert> no, it's trying to post the game result over and over
2011-09-16T13:41:28  <McLeopold> okay, that's not so bad

2011-09-16T13:42:55  <McLeopold> did I put an increasing delay in?
2011-09-16T13:43:32  <janzert> yes with a maximum of 5 minutes if I remember right
2011-09-16T13:43:56  <McLeopold> I created an sql file to reset the rankings, can you run that now that we have a different tau?
2011-09-16T13:44:18  <janzert> when did you change tau? ;)
2011-09-16T13:44:23  <McLeopold> you just did

2011-09-16T13:44:40  <janzert> nope, just draw probability
2011-09-16T13:44:43  <McLeopold> oh, no, wrong value
2011-09-16T13:44:47  <janzert> that's separate

2011-09-16T13:44:54  <McLeopold> still, can you reset?
2011-09-16T13:44:58  <janzert> but yeah we could reset anyway
2011-09-16T13:45:27  <janzert> which sql file is it?
2011-09-16T13:46:51  <janzert> both stuck games posted now, btw
2011-09-16T13:47:25  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-09-16T13:47:34  <McLeopold> reset_submission or reset_ranking
2011-09-16T13:47:51  <McLeopold> the one where I set all the values to 50.0 and 16.6667 and null
2011-09-16T13:48:10  <janzert> where would you have put it? I'm not seeing anything like that
2011-09-16T13:48:12  <McLeopold> even a draw prob of 1.75 makes a world of difference in the speed
2011-09-16T13:48:25  <janzert> ahh, /home/contest
2011-09-16T13:48:28  <McLeopold> or that
2011-09-16T13:48:53  <janzert> mysql -u contest aichallenge < reset_skills.sql right?
2011-09-16T13:49:07  <McLeopold> -D aichallenge
2011-09-16T13:49:25  <McLeopold> maybe you don't need the -D, I just always do it
2011-09-16T13:49:41  <McLeopold> mysqldump doesn't accept it
2011-09-16T13:49:41  <janzert> yeah, I'm pretty sure it's equivalent
2011-09-16T13:49:57  <janzert> ok, reset
2011-09-16T13:50:27  <McLeopold> I can now save 4 keystrokes...
2011-09-16T13:50:39  <janzert> :)
2011-09-16T13:51:14  <McLeopold> phpskills doesn't implement the max iterations
2011-09-16T13:51:19  <janzert> I'm going to check in the 5% draw probability for now
2011-09-16T13:51:32  <janzert> just goes forever if it doesn't converge

2011-09-16T13:52:38  <McLeopold> okay, last major change is a nightly process to create maps and update the max turns
2011-09-16T13:52:57  <McLeopold> did you make it come from the server_info?
2011-09-16T13:53:10  <McLeopold> nope
2011-09-16T13:53:15  <janzert> no, just manually changed it for now
2011-09-16T13:53:24  <McLeopold> can you do the max_turns update?
2011-09-16T13:53:56  <janzert> bleh

2011-09-16T13:54:11  <janzert> know anything about that?
2011-09-16T13:54:14  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-09-16T13:54:31  <McLeopold> I changed js-min to false, because it was causing errors
2011-09-16T13:54:41  <janzert> can I just remove it or does it need to stay around?
2011-09-16T13:54:42  <McLeopold> need to tell mleise
2011-09-16T13:54:59  <McLeopold> do a "git checkout default.properties"
2011-09-16T13:55:12  <McLeopold> just don't run ant
2011-09-16T13:55:14  <janzert> yep, that's what I meant by remove it
2011-09-16T13:55:18  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-16T13:55:19  <McLeopold> :)
2011-09-16T13:55:35  <McLeopold> maybe revert is more exact :)
2011-09-16T13:55:53  <janzert> yeah, although git revert seems to be something else entirely
2011-09-16T13:55:58  <janzert> :(
2011-09-16T13:55:59  <McLeopold> @later tell mleise minified script causes errors
2011-09-16T13:55:59  <contestbot> McLeopold: Ready to serve.
2011-09-16T13:56:07  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-16T13:56:23  <janzert> hmm, there were several visualizer changes that hadn't been pulled to the server
2011-09-16T13:56:27  <McLeopold> reset maybe?
2011-09-16T13:56:40  <McLeopold> since when?  I pulled last night
2011-09-16T13:56:42  <janzert> git reset seems to be something else too
2011-09-16T13:57:00  <janzert> I'm guessing mleise's earlier checkins
2011-09-16T13:57:14  <McLeopold> oh, he was busy
2011-09-16T13:57:23  <janzert> took me quite a while the first time to find the 'git checkout -- foo' the first time
2011-09-16T13:57:34  <McLeopold> what is that?
2011-09-16T13:57:40  <CIA-24> aichallenge: Marco Leise epsilon * re311542 / (6 files in 3 dirs): added new option "decorated"; if set to false only, the map view is visible - http://git.io/H-Udeg
2011-09-16T13:57:59  <janzert> hmm, and now the current visualizer widget doesn't want to work
2011-09-16T13:58:06  <mleise> :D
2011-09-16T13:58:10  <McLeopold> did you minify?
2011-09-16T13:58:10  <mleise> what's up?
2011-09-16T13:58:18  <janzert> hey hey
2011-09-16T13:58:26  <McLeopold> mleise: minified script thows errors
2011-09-16T13:58:27  <janzert> want to rebuild the visualizer on the server?
2011-09-16T13:58:40  <mleise> I can if you want me to
2011-09-16T13:58:43  <janzert> or give me the magic invocation
2011-09-16T13:58:44  <McLeopold> yeah, I think I put an sh script in for that
2011-09-16T13:58:48  <janzert> ls
2011-09-16T13:58:51  <McLeopold> deploy.sh
2011-09-16T13:59:34  <janzert> just "./deploy.sh" with no args?
2011-09-16T13:59:43  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-16T13:59:47  <McLeopold> or "ant deploy -Djava.plugin=/usr/share/icedtea-web/plugin.jar -Ddeploy.path=/home/contest/aichallenge/website"
2011-09-16T13:59:49  <janzert> ok, building
2011-09-16T14:00:10  <janzert> compile failed
2011-09-16T14:00:36  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/fUidwksN
2011-09-16T14:00:51  <mleise> there is a script in my home dir: update_visualizer.sh
2011-09-16T14:00:51  <janzert> ehh, I think I know
2011-09-16T14:01:09  <janzert> somebody did it from root at some point
2011-09-16T14:01:19  <mleise> it has to be :)
2011-09-16T14:01:21  <McLeopold> I thought I chowned it back to contest?
2011-09-16T14:01:40  <janzert> still several directories owned by root
2011-09-16T14:01:53  <McLeopold> well, do what mleise says then
2011-09-16T14:02:05  <mleise> I run the script wait a sec
2011-09-16T14:02:25  <mleise> There were problems in the past, so the script had to be run as root
2011-09-16T14:02:37  <mleise> I don't know what it was exactly
2011-09-16T14:02:40  <janzert> wait
2011-09-16T14:02:53  <mleise> too late :p
2011-09-16T14:02:56  <janzert> let me try it with everything reowned to contest and see
2011-09-16T14:02:58  <janzert> ahh well
2011-09-16T14:03:11  <mleise> ok I ctrl+z it
2011-09-16T14:03:53  <janzert> doesn't that just suspend it?
2011-09-16T14:04:26  <McLeopold> mleise: in the dynamic visualizer, I had the '#' check as a guard to prevent manipulating <pre> tags without it
2011-09-16T14:05:05  <McLeopold> so, if the pre tag doesn't start with a #, then it should remain text
2011-09-16T14:05:07  <mleise> janzert, now i ctrl+c ed it
2011-09-16T14:05:36  <mleise> McLeopold: ok, sorry if I broke that
2011-09-16T14:05:38  <janzert> yay, build successful
2011-09-16T14:05:53  <McLeopold> mleise: np, just need to put the main code inside the if
2011-09-16T14:06:00  <janzert> and it seems to actually work
2011-09-16T14:06:03  <mleise> janzert: ? wait a sec, it has to succeed with my script, too :)
2011-09-16T14:06:15  <McLeopold> actually, we should probably trim all the lines after the split as well
2011-09-16T14:06:27  <mleise> janzert: should I run it as user contest?
2011-09-16T14:06:51  <janzert> in general yes when manipulating the contest files
2011-09-16T14:07:01  <janzert> i.e. anything under /home/contest
2011-09-16T14:07:06  <mleise> McLeopold: why trim the lines?
2011-09-16T14:08:00  <McLeopold> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Va' of undefined
2011-09-16T14:08:09  <McLeopold> visualizer broken for me in chrome
2011-09-16T14:08:29  <McLeopold> visualizer-min.js:85
2011-09-16T14:08:30  <CIA-24> aichallenge: Marco Leise epsilon * r803886e / website/visualizer_widget.php : fix for last commit - http://git.io/6DUqsQ
2011-09-16T14:08:51  <McLeopold> mleise: so we don't have a leading space throw us off
2011-09-16T14:09:21  <mleise> Ok, add that if you like. There is now also the option to run the visualizer undecorated.
2011-09-16T14:09:30  <McLeopold> sweet
2011-09-16T14:09:38  <mleise> janzert: how do I start a shell as user contest? su contest bash ... ?
2011-09-16T14:09:48  <janzert> sudo su contest
2011-09-16T14:10:07  <janzert> at least that's generally the way I do it
2011-09-16T14:10:30  <janzert> there are a number of other ways to accomplish it of course
2011-09-16T14:10:34  <McLeopold> janzert: go here and check for javascript errors http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/specification.php
2011-09-16T14:11:06  <janzert> "a is undefined" from visualizer-min.js line 85
2011-09-16T14:11:29  <janzert> :(
2011-09-16T14:11:44  <janzert> and that only shows up with the minified version?
2011-09-16T14:11:48  <janzert> ugh
2011-09-16T14:13:07  <janzert> on FF7 here btw
2011-09-16T14:13:09  <McLeopold> yeah, just minified
2011-09-16T14:15:28  <mleise> ok the update script works as the contest user, but maybe the problem was with the downloads, not sure. I'll look into the JS problem
2011-09-16T14:18:42  <janzert> McLeopold: back to the per map turn limits
2011-09-16T14:19:01  <janzert> I thought I saw some stuff go in for that in your checkins, what is implemented now?
2011-09-16T14:19:08  <mleise> Looks like I broke Google's minifier
2011-09-16T14:19:22  <janzert> mleise: :(
2011-09-16T14:19:33  <janzert> seems like something that could be hard to track down too
2011-09-16T14:20:05  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm tracking the max_turns and game_length for each game, the map table has a turns value that is used by the worker
2011-09-16T14:20:19  <McLeopold> so, we just need to set the value in the map table once a night
2011-09-16T14:20:33  <janzert> ok
2011-09-16T14:20:46  <McLeopold> mleise: it only breaks on the spec page, so maybe we are just missing something
2011-09-16T14:21:36  <janzert> in the game table the field turns is the max turn limit and game_length is the actual length of the game?
2011-09-16T14:22:17  <janzert> we'll also need to track whether a cutoff was invoked
2011-09-16T14:23:55  <McLeopold> janzert: yes and yes
2011-09-16T14:24:04  *** amstan <amstan!~amstan@69-196-185-243.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge

2011-09-16T14:24:50  <McLeopold> janzert: cutoff is in the json, I just need to put it in the table
2011-09-16T14:25:04  * janzert nods
2011-09-16T14:25:07  <McLeopold> which would be nice to display in the game list anyway
2011-09-16T14:25:18  <janzert> yeah, probably a good idea
2011-09-16T14:26:42  <janzert> btw, I'd like to change the game displayed on the frontpage. Instead of just displaying the most recent game I'd like to limit it to either most recent game of the top ranked player or involving one of the top say 10 players
2011-09-16T14:26:57  <janzert> so we will most likely always have a good quality game on display
2011-09-16T14:28:32  <mleise> I should switch to https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS
2011-09-16T14:28:48  <mleise> It is faster, shaves off more bytes and more reliable
2011-09-16T14:29:09  <janzert> sounds like no downside ;)
2011-09-16T14:29:22  <mleise> ... well it has to be installed first :)
2011-09-16T14:29:35  <McLeopold> is that a nodejs project?
2011-09-16T14:29:40  <mleise> yes
2011-09-16T14:30:01  <McLeopold> do you minify after combining the files?
2011-09-16T14:30:44  <mleise> No I don't. Google supports multiple input files.
2011-09-16T14:30:57  <mleise> With UglifyJS I'd have to cat them together.
2011-09-16T14:31:55  <McLeopold> janzert: for the front page, I'd like to display a "10 most recent games", plus a sample game.  The api_game_result can choose when to switch the game, so we can only switch if it includes a rank <10 player.
2011-09-16T14:32:55  <McLeopold> I'll need some game awesomeness metrics...
2011-09-16T14:32:59  <janzert> I was thinking of giving the '10 most recent games' list its own page
2011-09-16T14:33:24  <McLeopold> okay, with a prominant link on the frontpage
2011-09-16T14:33:30  <janzert> yes
2011-09-16T14:33:47  <McLeopold> I'm actually kinda worried about database performance
2011-09-16T14:34:04  <janzert> pretty sure the visualizer for the sample game on the front page already gets pushed down into the fold anyway
2011-09-16T14:34:24  <McLeopold> I've gotten the database to be extremely fast for single page queries, but I haven't done any load testing, and I removed memcache stuff for the rankings
2011-09-16T14:34:28  <janzert> get memcache back in for the leaderboard results
2011-09-16T14:34:38  <janzert> :)

2011-09-16T14:34:51  <amstan> ...
2011-09-16T14:34:59  <McLeopold> our current front page doesn't reflect what it would actually look like
2011-09-16T14:35:01  <amstan> McLeopold: did you change the json page?
2011-09-16T14:35:01  <mleise> try again, this time it works
2011-09-16T14:35:16  <McLeopold> amstan: oh, yeah, that was part of removing the memcache stuff...
2011-09-16T14:35:29  <amstan> McLeopold: is it modified or is it removed?
2011-09-16T14:35:29  <McLeopold> it's kinda there, but I haven't tested it
2011-09-16T14:35:30  <janzert> even if you scroll the top down to pretend the beta message aren't there
2011-09-16T14:35:45  <McLeopold> well, the header needs to be shrunk
2011-09-16T14:35:51  <McLeopold> quite a bit
2011-09-16T14:36:06  <janzert> the visualizer sits right down to the fold for me and I've got 1920x1200
2011-09-16T14:36:24  <McLeopold> amstan: Fatal error: Call to undefined function cache_key() in /home/contest/aichallenge/website/ranking.php on line 287
2011-09-16T14:36:29  <mleise> and Opera is still behaving weird. Sometimes I see no text, or a comic font or the characters change size and have a negative spacing
2011-09-16T14:36:41  <McLeopold> amstan: I'll fix it now
2011-09-16T14:36:56  <McLeopold> we can remove google fonts
2011-09-16T14:37:43  <janzert> :(
2011-09-16T14:37:48  <amstan> hmm?
2011-09-16T14:37:56  <janzert> removing google fonts
2011-09-16T14:38:03  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, why remove those?
2011-09-16T14:38:36  <mleise> to see if it fixes Opera?
2011-09-16T14:38:39  <janzert> btw, IE 6 is down to 2.4% of ai-contest visits
2011-09-16T14:39:24  <mleise> I'm only interested in Σ IE<=8
2011-09-16T14:39:36  <janzert> IE < 9 is ~4%
2011-09-16T14:40:06  <janzert> I think back in July it was 5 or 6%?
2011-09-16T14:40:12  <mleise> ok, I hope these 4% recognize my work on the applet :p
2011-09-16T14:40:25  <janzert> :)
2011-09-16T14:40:59  <janzert> 0.07% IE with Chrome Frame
2011-09-16T14:42:40  <mleise> ok, I'm pretty much offline for today. don't update the visualizer if you need the minified version to work until I get UglifyJS working :)
2011-09-16T14:43:12  <McLeopold> mleise: can you describe the options first?

2011-09-16T14:48:10  <mleise> follow the link to http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer/jsdoc/symbols/Options.html for details on the settings
2011-09-16T14:50:18  <janzert> McLeopold: can you make the database and game update changes to record if a cutoff occured and I'll work on the script to update the map limits
2011-09-16T14:53:41  <janzert> hmm
2011-09-16T14:54:15  <janzert> ChrisH Go language submission was accepted but is now not compiling on the worker
2011-09-16T14:54:52  <janzert> which looks like it is causing the worker to infinite loop trying to play a game with it
2011-09-16T14:54:54  <mleise> I remember someone claiming that he got no output file
2011-09-16T14:55:28  <mleise> ["Output file /home/contest/compiled/tmp0J6Zha/bot/MyBot was not created."]
2011-09-16T14:55:35  <janzert> right
2011-09-16T14:55:55  <mleise> that was for user 'jnwhiteh' (same nick here)
2011-09-16T14:56:14  <janzert> that was apparently because the Go compiler doesn't report errors on stderr like every other compiler does
2011-09-16T14:56:15  <jnwhiteh> correct
2011-09-16T14:56:36  <janzert> I think McLeopold checked in a fix for that
2011-09-16T14:58:12  <McLeopold> I did
2011-09-16T14:58:34  <McLeopold> but if it fails on one worker, it should fail on all?
2011-09-16T14:59:01  <janzert> will the system eventually give up on this game or just loop forever?
2011-09-16T14:59:17  <McLeopold> we need to fix that
2011-09-16T14:59:30  <McLeopold> obviously it needs to give up
2011-09-16T15:00:05  <McLeopold> I think at first I was concerned the other players would loose their seed, but if the matchup is deleted, they would pop back to the front
2011-09-16T15:00:07  <janzert> that would probably be good, although the forever loop makes the problem obvious
2011-09-16T15:00:27  <McLeopold> and the submission needs to not be accepted to begin with
2011-09-16T15:01:16  <janzert> I think we need to go back to a static version of go instead of tracking the latest stable
2011-09-16T15:01:41  <janzert> the problem could be that it did compile and now a new version broke it
2011-09-16T15:02:20  <janzert> i.e. I think the stable version is still changing too rapidly for us
2011-09-16T15:02:43  <mleise> same for D :p
2011-09-16T15:03:44  <janzert> we stick to a static version of D
2011-09-16T15:03:50  <janzert> currently 2.053
2011-09-16T15:04:16  <jnwhiteh> If you tell people what version you're on with Go
2011-09-16T15:04:18  <jnwhiteh> taht's a non-problem
2011-09-16T15:04:19  <jnwhiteh> we can write for it
2011-09-16T15:04:20  <McLeopold> so, when a new worker was brought up, it broke a submission that was already marked as good?
2011-09-16T15:04:32  <jnwhiteh> the Split/SplitN problem is a bit frustrating, but we can deal with it
2011-09-16T15:04:41  <janzert> jnwhiteh: except it might change after a bot has already been submitted
2011-09-16T15:04:55  <janzert> worse after the finals had started
2011-09-16T15:05:07  <jnwhiteh> then pick release.r60
2011-09-16T15:05:10  <McLeopold> janzert: I need to detect a compile error while running a game, and report back to mark the submission as broken
2011-09-16T15:05:11  <jnwhiteh> and just say that's what you're going to use
2011-09-16T15:05:12  <janzert> McLeopold: that's my guess yes
2011-09-16T15:05:20  <jnwhiteh> people can code for that easily, and change their local go to match that if they need to
2011-09-16T15:05:29  <McLeopold> that will frustrate some people, since it worked before, but not now
2011-09-16T15:05:30  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah, that's probably needed
2011-09-16T15:05:53  <janzert> jnwhiteh: that's what I was refering to above
2011-09-16T15:06:02  <jnwhiteh> *nod*, absolutely
2011-09-16T15:06:35  <janzert> part of the problem is that getting a static version of Go isn't easy
2011-09-16T15:06:55  <janzert> we were compiling it from scratch before and that takes a fair amount of time
2011-09-16T15:07:01  <jnwhiteh> O.o
2011-09-16T15:07:10  <jnwhiteh> go takes about 30 seconds to compile
2011-09-16T15:07:18  <jnwhiteh> if you run all of the tests/benchmarks it takes much longer, obviously
2011-09-16T15:07:26  <jnwhiteh> I'm happy to help in any way
2011-09-16T15:07:30  <janzert> hmm, maybe that's what it was doing
2011-09-16T15:07:49  <jnwhiteh> ./all.bash will do all of that ./make.bash just makes/installs
2011-09-16T15:08:42  <janzert> it would be great if you could take a look in the setup/worker_setup.py script at the install_<language name> for examples and see if you could write one to install a static version of go quickly
2011-09-16T15:08:53  <jnwhiteh> sure, lemme look
2011-09-16T15:10:01  <janzert> generally they use curl to download a tarball or .deb and then install it from there
2011-09-16T15:10:20  <jnwhiteh> go requires mercurial, if you can't rely on that, i'll try to find you a package that works
2011-09-16T15:10:42  <janzert> yeah, it was checking out from mercurial before
2011-09-16T15:11:02  <McLeopold> janzert: we could run gofix on entries :)
2011-09-16T15:11:06  <janzert> if it could just download a tarball from somewhere would be preferred
2011-09-16T15:11:22  <jnwhiteh> If you install golang-60 from this ppa (which you already seem to be doing there) that would be fine: https://launchpad.net/~gophers/+archive/go/+packages
2011-09-16T15:11:43  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah, I'm not sure how reliable that is for fully automatic updates though
2011-09-16T15:11:56  <jnwhiteh> janzert: it covers almost any language breaking change
2011-09-16T15:11:57  <McLeopold> not at all
2011-09-16T15:11:58  <janzert> jnwhiteh: ahh, yeah that should work
2011-09-16T15:12:00  <jnwhiteh> that's why gofix is around =)
2011-09-16T15:12:33  <McLeopold> let's just call it at r60
2011-09-16T15:12:58  <jnwhiteh> it'll be a month until the next release, and if you stick at r60 that's easy enough
2011-09-16T15:13:26  <janzert> hmm, is that package install going to break when the ppa moves to r61 though?
2011-09-16T15:13:41  <jnwhiteh> that's a question I don't know how to answer =)
2011-09-16T15:14:26  <amstan> janzert: so, you still want to use 10.10?
2011-09-16T15:14:30  <janzert> I have a feeling it does, since I don't see any r59 package around :(
2011-09-16T15:14:33  <amstan> it's almost time for 11.10 now
2011-09-16T15:14:44  <janzert> no, we're on 11.04
2011-09-16T15:14:45  <jnwhiteh> just stash the .deb locally?
2011-09-16T15:15:04  <jnwhiteh> you could curl it from your own servers?
2011-09-16T15:15:06  <amstan> janzert: i'm just referring to the time you were hesitant to update to 11.04
2011-09-16T15:15:18  <janzert> hmm, putting the .deb on the main server might be an option
2011-09-16T15:16:06  <janzert> well, if you think it's ok to have all the go submissions break in the middle of the finals then... :P
2011-09-16T15:17:54  <janzert> hmm, I think I might move all the ppa installed languages to simply grab debs from the main server

2011-09-16T15:19:25  <janzert> actually all manually installed languages could have there package file (whether .deb or tarball) placed on the main server so we aren't sucking up the language sites bandwidth (and won't be reliant on there server staying up)

2011-09-16T16:08:55  <janzert> McLeopold: something is still wacky with the pairing, a few players only have one game and a few have over 30
2011-09-16T16:14:06  <McLeopold> is it the go submissions?
2011-09-16T16:14:30  <janzert> nope
2011-09-16T16:15:17  <McLeopold> it correlates to sigma
2011-09-16T16:15:49  <janzert> doesn't seem to
2011-09-16T16:15:58  <McLeopold> well, match quality always goes up with lower sigma
2011-09-16T16:16:13  <McLeopold> sort by games, the low count has high sigma and vice versa
2011-09-16T16:17:50  <McLeopold> well, more games would cause more certainty as well, but I think it is still the match quality factor
2011-09-16T16:18:06  <janzert> hmm
2011-09-16T16:18:56  <janzert> too bad the column sort doesn't go across pages ;)
2011-09-16T16:19:21  <McLeopold> increase page_size to 400 for a quick glance
2011-09-16T16:19:26  <McLeopold> ranking.php
2011-09-16T16:20:57  <janzert> hmm, sigma *should* correlate so strongly with number of games played it's hard to tell whether it's the cause or effect :/
2011-09-16T16:21:09  <McLeopold> yeah, it's both
2011-09-16T16:21:31  <McLeopold> I know it is, that's how the match quality works, sigma is the biggest factor
2011-09-16T16:22:00  <McLeopold> we want new entries to play well established entries
2011-09-16T16:22:15  <McLeopold> but if every new entry picks the same established entry, that is bad
2011-09-16T16:23:07  <janzert> shouldn't it be trying to minimize skill difference first?
2011-09-16T16:23:13  <janzert> anyway gotta run
2011-09-16T16:23:22  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-16T16:23:28  <McLeopold> that's not how quality works
2011-09-16T16:23:36  <McLeopold> it does play a factor though

2011-09-16T16:49:30  <janzert> it will choose B?

2011-09-16T22:53:48  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I saw in the log that my Go bot is causing some problems. I was wondering if there have been any more thoughts about dealing with the Go versioning issue.
2011-09-16T23:05:44  <McLeopold> ChrisH: we are going to use r60
2011-09-16T23:06:08  <ChrisH> ok, that's what I'm using now, so that's easy.
2011-09-16T23:06:22  <ChrisH> any idea when that will be in place on the server for testing?

2011-09-16T23:12:55  <janzert1> it's already using r60 at the moment
2011-09-16T23:13:09  <janzert1> but currently would keep upgrading with new releases

2011-09-16T23:15:31  <eashoka> McLeopold : are the workers going to get started again or is this the 'silence before the storm' ? :-)
2011-09-16T23:16:10  <janzert1> hmm, workers are running
2011-09-16T23:16:38  *** janzert1 is now known as janzert
2011-09-16T23:19:13  <McLeopold> eashoka: they should be working, but I will be playing with rankings over the weekend
2011-09-16T23:19:28  <McLeopold> and the games will be shorter so I can get good stats on how the final will go
2011-09-16T23:23:04  <eashoka> McLeopold : ok, tx.

2011-09-16T23:26:02  <eashoka> janzert : I have a vastly modified version of the feature request from yesterday. the one you said could be done. Can't the visualizer play the game live ? I mean if a single turn takes a second, and if there are about 1000 turns per game. that would be 15 minutes of entertainment and added suspense! can the visualizer just play turn by turn as it receives them fro the server. (via an Ajax request from JQuery maybe, instead of
2011-09-16T23:26:36  <janzert> the games aren't played on the same machine as the webserver
2011-09-16T23:26:51  <janzert> so it would take quite a bit of work to stream them live back
2011-09-16T23:28:22  <janzert> McLeopold: something weird is going on with the workers, I can see that they are both playing games but the stats page shows no activity
2011-09-16T23:30:08  <eashoka> janzert : ah ok. forget that too then. :-)
2011-09-16T23:30:40  <eashoka> McLeopold : yea, that's what I meant. no activity in the ranking page and profile pages too
2011-09-16T23:31:45  <ChrisH> If the servers are already using golang r60, will my bot get a chance to play some games? I would like to verify golang is going to work before I sink too much time into the bot code.

2011-09-16T23:46:39  <McLeopold> janzert: it's probably the cutoff code in the api_game_result.php
2011-09-16T23:47:05  <McLeopold> maybe a boolean to sql tinyint issue
