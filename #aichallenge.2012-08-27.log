2012-08-27T15:10:06  <thestinger> lambdas are pretty nice as scope guards too
2012-08-27T15:14:44  <mcstar> thestinger: whats that?
2012-08-27T15:15:27  <thestinger> mcstar: http://sprunge.us/ZAGP like that
2012-08-27T15:15:31  <thestinger> it's convenient when using C APIs
2012-08-27T15:15:34  <thestinger> that don't use RAII
2012-08-27T15:15:52  <thestinger> you just need a little make_scope_guard function and you can give anything RAII (unique_ptr does cover some use cases now though)
2012-08-27T15:15:53  <mcstar> dont use c
2012-08-27T15:16:05  <thestinger> mcstar: even C++ libraries don't use RAII properly
2012-08-27T15:16:08  <thestinger> for example LevelDB
2012-08-27T15:16:24  <mcstar> what is hard to get right about raii?
2012-08-27T15:16:46  <thestinger> lots of projects (for example anything made by google) don't use exceptions (they can't, due to legacy code)
2012-08-27T15:16:51  <thestinger> so their libraries don't use exceptions
2012-08-27T15:16:57  <thestinger> no exceptions means you can't really use constructors
2012-08-27T15:17:05  <thestinger> and then RAII ends up pretty hard to implement properly
2012-08-27T15:17:10  <mcstar> o.O
2012-08-27T15:17:19  <mcstar> why cant they use exceptions?
2012-08-27T15:17:27  <mcstar> that is one big selling point of c++ over c
2012-08-27T15:17:29  <mcstar> i think
2012-08-27T15:17:36  <thestinger> because exception safety requires RAII
2012-08-27T15:17:40  <thestinger> for pretty much *everything*
2012-08-27T15:17:49  <thestinger> no delete, fclose, close, sqlite3_close, or any equivalents allowed
2012-08-27T15:17:53  <thestinger> pretty much
2012-08-27T15:18:15  <thestinger> and they have big legacy codebases
2012-08-27T15:18:32  <mcstar> legacy c codebase?
2012-08-27T15:18:42  <thestinger> mcstar: also C++, before people used it like they do now
2012-08-27T15:18:49  <thestinger> anyway scope guards are nice for other things
2012-08-27T15:18:53  <mcstar> write a correct wrapper for it
2012-08-27T15:18:59  <thestinger> you can use raii for a lot more than resources
2012-08-27T15:19:05  <thestinger> like how the C++11 threading API has scoped locks
2012-08-27T15:19:30  <mcstar> scoped locks dont require c++11
2012-08-27T15:19:47  <mcstar> did c++11 add thread support for the language?
2012-08-27T15:19:50  <thestinger> yes
2012-08-27T15:19:51  <ronchaine> Yes
2012-08-27T15:20:01  <thestinger> mcstar: as did C11 to C (I think they are somewhat compatible)
2012-08-27T15:20:30  <thestinger> mcstar: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/doc/html/thread.html it was based on that
2012-08-27T15:20:43  <thestinger> but they also added atomics, etc.
2012-08-27T15:21:06  <mcstar> boost ofc
2012-08-27T15:21:40  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock_guard and http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock
2012-08-27T15:22:13  <mcstar> i dont care much for c++ as i said many times, it is just too bad, that there are not much choice other than c++ when you want cross platform high quality gui(qt)
2012-08-27T15:23:08  <mcstar> i wrote a little benchmark in f#/mono that trashed the qt event loop
2012-08-27T15:23:13  <mcstar> it wasnt really too bad
2012-08-27T15:23:26  <thestinger> qt isn't really high performance
2012-08-27T15:23:27  <mcstar> 95fps vs. 120
2012-08-27T15:23:33  <thestinger> probably better than glib/gtk though
2012-08-27T15:23:39  <mcstar> qt is high quality
2012-08-27T15:23:41  <thestinger> yes
2012-08-27T15:23:46  <mcstar> performance is ok
2012-08-27T15:23:47  <thestinger> but it's coded in a very dynamic java style
2012-08-27T15:23:51  <thestinger> not that it's a bad thing
2012-08-27T15:23:55  <thestinger> it's just not fast/light
2012-08-27T15:24:00  <thestinger> it makes it more flexible
2012-08-27T15:24:21  <mcstar> it uses signals/slots which is quite dynamic and all the event handlers are virtuals
2012-08-27T15:24:35  <thestinger> I'm sure they would do things a bit differently today
2012-08-27T15:24:35  <mcstar> it is fast
2012-08-27T15:24:59  <mcstar> when it comes to complex thins, it is faster i think, than something an average joe would have come up with
2012-08-27T15:25:07  <mcstar> with its spaghetti code and such
2012-08-27T15:25:10  <thestinger> well ofc :P
2012-08-27T15:25:25  <thestinger> but it has a long legacy since it was around before the C++ standard lib
2012-08-27T15:25:42  <thestinger> but they do a good job modernizing stuff
2012-08-27T15:25:57  <mcstar> you dont have to use that part, but it fits nicely i think(also i dont use other components)
2012-08-27T15:26:14  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2012-08-27T15:26:42  <mcstar> what id like to see, is a nice gui abstraction for a functional language, ocaml/haskell
2012-08-27T15:28:16  <mcstar> f# is multi paradigm, has a nice oo part, so qt can actually fit in, but you have to consider mono when deploying on linux
2012-08-27T15:28:38  <mcstar> and you have to get the smoke/smokegen/qyoto part working on windows
2012-08-27T15:29:46  <mcstar> thestinger: a similar app, written in ocaml, with graphics from its stdlib, performance was around 400fps
2012-08-27T15:30:11  <mcstar> but thats because of the much simpler event handling of that lib
2012-08-27T15:30:56  <thestinger> mcstar: have you tried the enlightenment stuff?
2012-08-27T15:31:03  <mcstar> http://sprunge.us/FefU
2012-08-27T15:31:12  <mcstar> thestinger: thats not for desktop
2012-08-27T15:31:19  <mcstar> it is closer to qt quick
2012-08-27T15:31:34  <thestinger> but e17 is a DE :P
2012-08-27T15:31:38  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-27T15:31:53  <mcstar> but the enlightenment native gui's dont belong to the desktop
2012-08-27T15:32:11  <mcstar> it doesnt resemble usual widgets and stuff
2012-08-27T15:32:24  <thestinger> ah
2012-08-27T15:32:39  <thestinger> well linux doesn't really have a default widget look anyway
2012-08-27T15:32:39  <mcstar> and they are probably very limited in functionality comapred to full widget toolkits
2012-08-27T15:32:55  <mcstar> thestinger: motif!
2012-08-27T15:32:58  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-27T15:33:08  <thestinger> I love how ugly tk is on linux
2012-08-27T15:33:14  <thestinger> it looks okay on OS X and windows
2012-08-27T15:33:14  <mcstar> old tk is
2012-08-27T15:33:19  <mcstar> new tk isnt that ugly
2012-08-27T15:33:38  <mcstar> there are a couple of themes for linux
2012-08-27T15:33:46  <thestinger> the default is ugly
2012-08-27T15:33:51  <mcstar> sort of :)
2012-08-27T15:34:00  <mcstar> ok, damn ugly
2012-08-27T15:34:05  <mcstar> but its fast
2012-08-27T15:34:12  <thestinger> I don't actually mind gtk, but C APIs are just awful
2012-08-27T15:34:18  <thestinger> so it's awful to use
2012-08-27T15:34:22  <mcstar> anyway, im more concerned about the way you can program it
2012-08-27T15:34:27  <thestinger> stupid horrible gobject/glib stuff
2012-08-27T15:34:30  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-27T15:34:41  <thestinger> gtkmm/glibmm are actually pretty nice
2012-08-27T15:34:51  <mcstar> wxwidgets vs qt, those are the main contenters
2012-08-27T15:35:04  <mcstar> d*
2012-08-27T15:35:20  <mcstar> ronchaine: btw, dont feel ignored
2012-08-27T15:35:28  <mcstar> but you have to talk more to be talked to
2012-08-27T15:35:48  <thestinger> gtkmm really isn't that bad
2012-08-27T15:36:44  <thestinger> the C++ style is actually a bit more modern than Qt, since that's all it really is (a modern-ish C++ wrapper around gtk)
2012-08-27T15:36:48  <thestinger> but Qt is a nicer toolkit
2012-08-27T15:38:55  <ronchaine> mcstar: Don't worry, I don't.
2012-08-27T15:40:00  <mcstar> thestinger: the point is, these object oriented apis are not usable from a functional language
2012-08-27T15:40:10  <mcstar> except a multi-paradigm one, like F#
2012-08-27T15:40:14  <thestinger> yeah
2012-08-27T15:40:22  <mcstar> but the functional ones, like gtk, are a pain
2012-08-27T15:40:25  <mcstar> so fuck it
2012-08-27T15:40:29  *** mattswe <mattswe!u4809@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-fjurbcdkfaotumnr> has joined #aichallenge
2012-08-27T15:40:43  <thestinger> I was reading about the functional-reactive programming thing
2012-08-27T15:40:56  <mcstar> that doesnt really solve the problem
2012-08-27T15:41:02  <mcstar> it solves data dependency
2012-08-27T15:41:09  <mcstar> but doesnt solve the problem of composition
2012-08-27T15:41:16  <mcstar> according to my understanding
2012-08-27T15:42:32  <mcstar> there is a similar thing for common lisp, called 'cells'
2012-08-27T15:42:44  <mcstar> theres a cells-gtk binding
2012-08-27T15:43:19  <mcstar> but then, with common lisp you lose the static strong typing and things built around that
2012-08-27T15:44:21  <mcstar> thestinger: my qt paste was kind og motivated by frp, thats why the name, but maybe this is obvious
2012-08-27T15:45:55  <thestinger> rust is pretty cool
2012-08-27T15:46:34  <thestinger> it's neat that they have things similar to references and the different smart pointer types in C++, but it's still memory safe (you can't have a dangling pointer, etc.)
2012-08-27T15:47:07  <thestinger> they use typestate
2012-08-27T15:47:17  <mcstar> i bet theres no gui for rust
2012-08-27T15:48:08  <thestinger> it does have bindings
2012-08-27T15:48:37  <thestinger> not in the stdlib yet
2012-08-27T15:53:32  <thestinger> mcstar: http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#traits this is pretty neat
2012-08-27T15:53:39  <thestinger> kind of like type classes, but can also be dynamically
2012-08-27T15:54:03  <thestinger> I just wish the syntax wasn't so ugly
2012-08-27T15:55:01  <thestinger> I guess you become used to it
2012-08-27T15:55:07  <thestinger> they just use a lot of operators
2012-08-27T15:55:12  <thestinger> as does haskell
2012-08-27T16:19:20  <mcstar> thestinger: oh, btw, zsh sucks
2012-08-27T16:19:37  <thestinger> what now? :P
2012-08-27T16:20:30  <mcstar> well, it is slow
2012-08-27T16:20:35  <mcstar> much slower than bash
2012-08-27T16:20:38  <mcstar> or any other shell
2012-08-27T16:20:52  <mcstar> im talking about the delay, that the prompt is drawn
2012-08-27T16:21:22  <thestinger> I don't have a delay
2012-08-27T16:21:23  <mcstar> how fast is it for you if you leave your finger on enter?
2012-08-27T16:21:29  <thestinger> instant basically
2012-08-27T16:21:37  <thestinger> mcstar: it's as fast as the key repeat
2012-08-27T16:21:38  <mcstar> i have a huge delay
2012-08-27T16:21:46  <thestinger> mcstar: even with a simple prompt?
2012-08-27T16:21:47  <mcstar> not nearlyy as fast for me
2012-08-27T16:21:50  <thestinger> maybe your prompt is doing git stuff
2012-08-27T16:21:55  <mcstar> no
2012-08-27T16:22:00  <mcstar> it doesnt depend on PS1
2012-08-27T16:22:06  <thestinger> are you using a custom prompt?
2012-08-27T16:22:08  <mcstar> thats the weird part
2012-08-27T16:22:09  <thestinger> or a built-in one
2012-08-27T16:22:15  <mcstar> doesnt depend on it
2012-08-27T16:22:20  <thestinger> some of the built-in ones have really complex features
2012-08-27T16:22:23  <thestinger> mcstar: what do you mean?
2012-08-27T16:22:25  <mcstar> but its a custom simple prompt
2012-08-27T16:22:43  <mcstar> thestinger: the delay doesnt depend on the prompt configuration
2012-08-27T16:22:48  <thestinger> hmm
2012-08-27T16:23:08  <mcstar> if i enter bash, everything is isntant
2012-08-27T16:23:20  <thestinger> well I don't get a delay in either
2012-08-27T16:23:29  <thestinger> mcstar: what's in your zshrc?
2012-08-27T16:24:10  <mcstar> http://sprunge.us/KKjC
2012-08-27T16:26:19  <thestinger> mcstar: I don't get a delay with this prompt, so I guess that isn't it
2012-08-27T16:27:04  <mcstar> yay, einstein
2012-08-27T16:27:07  <thestinger> :P
2012-08-27T16:27:50  <mcstar> thestinger: is there a startup option, to prevent reading the config files?
2012-08-27T16:28:21  <thestinger> ZDOTDIR=/dev/null zsh
2012-08-27T16:28:35  <thestinger> well that prevents reading some
2012-08-27T16:29:07  <mcstar> slowness..
2012-08-27T16:29:13  <thestinger> mcstar: I do get a slight delay with the default prompt that has git info in it
2012-08-27T16:29:33  <mcstar> ok, but that would be understandable
2012-08-27T16:29:45  <mcstar> but the difference between bash and zsh is huge
2012-08-27T16:29:52  <mcstar> like, rowing in honey
2012-08-27T16:29:54  <thestinger> not here :P
2012-08-27T16:30:08  <mcstar> thestinger: probably, this distro, arch sucks
2012-08-27T16:30:10  <thestinger> they seem to print at exactly the same speed
2012-08-27T16:30:16  <mcstar> i always suspected it is slow..
2012-08-27T16:30:21  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-27T16:30:22  <thestinger> I am on arch too... :P
2012-08-27T16:30:43  <mcstar> ill try a real terminal
2012-08-27T16:30:59  <thestinger> well I'm using termite ofc :P
2012-08-27T16:31:26  <mcstar> same
2012-08-27T16:37:50  <thestinger> mcstar: it's still slow with defaults?
2012-08-27T16:38:11  <mcstar> yeah, with the envvar you pasted
2012-08-27T16:43:35  <thestinger> mcstar: oh
2012-08-27T16:43:53  <thestinger> mcstar: try without sharehistory set
2012-08-27T16:44:20  <thestinger> oh wait that wouldn't have been set anyway
2012-08-27T16:44:22  <thestinger> hmm
2012-08-27T16:44:34  * thestinger has no idea now
2012-08-27T16:46:54  <mcstar> ill just live with it in the moment
2012-08-27T16:47:02  <mcstar> at
2012-08-27T16:47:37  <thestinger> maybe a bug
2012-08-27T16:47:55  <thestinger> mcstar: try setopt nosharehistory though
2012-08-27T16:48:00  <thestinger> I suspect it could be that
2012-08-27T16:48:26  <mcstar> no
2012-08-27T16:48:33  <mcstar> it woudlnt save a newline anyway
2012-08-27T16:49:30  <thestinger> but I think it rereads the history on a prompt print
2012-08-27T16:52:38  <mcstar> why?
2012-08-27T16:52:50  <mcstar> it needs to read history, when you push up arrow
2012-08-27T16:53:11  <mcstar> things can happen in another instance of zsh while you idle at your prompt

2012-08-27T17:07:07  <mcstar> thestinger: apparently, a static templated class method cannot be called without parameterizing the name resolution
2012-08-27T17:07:48  <mcstar> thestinger: im trying to put your make_scope_guard function into the scope_guard class as a static method
2012-08-27T17:08:13  <thestinger> mcstar: well the reason for the wrapper function is to avoid that
2012-08-27T17:08:48  <thestinger> otherwise you have to use scope_guard<decltype(func)> guard(func) after doing auto func = []() {};
2012-08-27T17:09:35  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-27T17:09:41  <mcstar> but i thought it was possible without that

2012-08-27T17:20:28  <mcstar> this is the better one
2012-08-27T17:20:37  <mcstar> i read it quite a while ago
2012-08-27T17:21:38  <thestinger> you can do nice stuff with variadic templates
2012-08-27T17:23:10  <mcstar> c++ simply has too much syntactic noise, and there a lot of intricacies too keep in mind, and it isnt good when you write your code, to satisfy your compiler
2012-08-27T17:23:31  <thestinger> yes
2012-08-27T17:23:34  <thestinger> way too much legacy crap
2012-08-27T17:23:42  <thestinger> and way too hard to do simple things
2012-08-27T17:24:13  <thestinger> Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible."
2012-08-27T17:24:24  <mcstar> it is powerful, no doubt, but i dont think it scales well, and your time is better spent doing something else
2012-08-27T17:24:30  <mcstar> but ofc, it has its place
2012-08-27T17:24:39  <thestinger> C++ makes simple things complex and complex things complex :P
2012-08-27T17:25:07  <thestinger> templates are such a pain most of the time

2012-08-27T17:27:24  <mcstar> i think i confused him with some other alan
