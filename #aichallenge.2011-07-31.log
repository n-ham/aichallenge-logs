2011-07-31T08:16:31  <antimatroid1> i can't say sigh without thinking about him now
2011-07-31T08:16:39  <antimatroid1> and people in irc can't sigh without alerting him ;)
2011-07-31T08:17:00  <sigh> I guess my mission is complete then :P
2011-07-31T08:19:56  <Hjax> lol
2011-07-31T08:23:25  <mcstar> it only proves that he(?) is a very lonely man
2011-07-31T08:23:46  <sigh> :(
2011-07-31T08:24:09  <mcstar> i think god was lonely too, then he invented curse words
2011-07-31T08:24:35  <sigh> the curse words kept him company?
2011-07-31T08:24:44  <mcstar> i guess
2011-07-31T08:24:53  <antimatroid1> I don't see proof of anything :P
2011-07-31T08:25:04  <mcstar> i mean people always mentioned him, and he felt good about it
2011-07-31T08:25:20  <mcstar> (we swear a lot with god in it)
2011-07-31T08:25:37  <antimatroid1> you don't know he felt good and a non-lonely man could feel good about it :P
2011-07-31T08:26:06  <antimatroid1> ignore me, i've been playing around with binary relations all weekend
2011-07-31T08:26:10  <antimatroid1> i'm in a very logical mood
2011-07-31T08:26:21  <mcstar> that explains your behavior
2011-07-31T08:26:34  <mcstar> no, its called annoying
2011-07-31T08:26:39  <mcstar> :D
2011-07-31T08:27:15  <antimatroid1> what is annoying is injectivity and surjectivity changing ideas if you treat a correspondence as a left-total binary relation or a function to the power set of the range of the correspondence
2011-07-31T08:27:16  <mcstar> i sadly dont have time to polish my bot
2011-07-31T08:28:08  <sigh> polishing my bot is much easier
2011-07-31T08:28:12  <mcstar> thats a simple thing said convolutedly
2011-07-31T08:28:13  <sigh> since it doesn't exist
2011-07-31T08:28:13  <antimatroid1> done
2011-07-31T08:28:29  <antimatroid1> mcstar: it is, but i'm trying to make a category of games
2011-07-31T08:28:56  <antimatroid1> well, i'm pretty sure i have, i just need to work out all my terminology, which is annoying
2011-07-31T08:29:24  * antimatroid1 also has no time for his bot
2011-07-31T08:29:42  <mcstar> have faith, it will work out
2011-07-31T08:30:09  <mcstar> math is guiding humanoids since ~5000 years
2011-07-31T08:30:18  <sigh> why 5000?
2011-07-31T08:30:25  <mcstar> ok, 5521
2011-07-31T08:30:35  <mcstar> is that better?
2011-07-31T08:30:48  <sigh> it's more precise, sure
2011-07-31T08:30:59  <sigh> but I still question it's accuracy
2011-07-31T08:31:04  <sigh> *its
2011-07-31T08:31:06  <mcstar> hehe
2011-07-31T08:31:16  <mcstar> go ahead, i wont argue with you
2011-07-31T08:31:40  <sigh> but you always argue with me
2011-07-31T08:31:49  <mcstar> I DONT
2011-07-31T08:31:52  <mcstar> YOU....
2011-07-31T08:32:13  <mcstar> lol, that guy was really funny yesterday
2011-07-31T08:32:22  <sigh> what happened yesterday?
2011-07-31T08:32:37  <mcstar> read the logs, search for mad.man
2011-07-31T08:32:45  <mcstar> .->_
2011-07-31T08:32:49  <antimatroid1> well, i have to treat a correspondence p from A to B as a relation (subset of AxB) then have the notation p(a) = {b \in B:(a,b) \in p} so that surjectivity of p implies union_a p(a) = B, but then I also need a name for what it means if b \in p(a1) and b \in p(a2) then p(a1) == p(a2) (not a1 == a2 which would be injectivity?)
2011-07-31T08:33:07  <antimatroid1> fml
2011-07-31T08:34:06  <sigh> mcstar: he doesn't hold a candle to Accoun
2011-07-31T08:34:41  * mcstar is not a native speaker
2011-07-31T08:34:49  <antimatroid1> I like accoun because he's a good competitor
2011-07-31T08:34:50  <mcstar> meaning accoun. is even worse?
2011-07-31T08:34:53  <antimatroid1> i do wish he'd lighten up though
2011-07-31T08:35:16  <sigh> mcstar: right
2011-07-31T08:35:43  <sigh> antimatroid1: a candle would help with that
2011-07-31T08:36:27  <mcstar> not light him up
2011-07-31T08:36:33  <antimatroid1> i want to define subgames for normal form games
2011-07-31T08:36:39  <antimatroid1> but i'm a bit iffy about it :\
2011-07-31T08:40:20  <mcstar> ? p(a1) is not a set
2011-07-31T08:41:01  <mcstar> antimatroid1:
2011-07-31T08:41:26  <mcstar> did you mean =?
2011-07-31T08:42:54  <mcstar> and if i understand it correctly, then no, its not injectivity

2011-07-31T10:34:32  <Hjax> wow my bot actually did what i wanted it to do for once
2011-07-31T10:34:38  <Hjax> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=115773&user=10
2011-07-31T10:44:13  <Hjax> anyone here
2011-07-31T10:49:11  <bhasker> morning
2011-07-31T10:49:23  <bhasker> wassup hjax
2011-07-31T10:52:05  <Hjax> hi bhasker
2011-07-31T10:52:37  <bhasker> hey
2011-07-31T10:52:42  <Hjax> the first example of my bot doing something remotely intelligent (winning): http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=115773&user=10
2011-07-31T10:53:37  <Hjax> and my anti suicide method finally works :)
2011-07-31T10:53:57  <bhasker> why are they all in a line
2011-07-31T10:54:04  <bhasker> and they all seem to go for the same food
2011-07-31T10:54:17  <bhasker> looks pretty to watch
2011-07-31T10:54:29  <bhasker> but probably not as efficient
2011-07-31T10:55:08  <bhasker> it did well in that game though
2011-07-31T10:55:17  <bhasker> liked the way it kind of like has this wall
2011-07-31T10:55:22  <bhasker> of progressing ants
2011-07-31T10:55:44  <Hjax> yeah, that was from all of the ants going for the same target
2011-07-31T10:55:56  <bhasker> yea not very efficet
2011-07-31T10:55:58  <bhasker> efficient*
2011-07-31T10:56:04  <bhasker> you could have been collecting more food in that time
2011-07-31T10:56:10  <bhasker> and growing exponentially
2011-07-31T10:56:27  <Hjax> my bot is growing at a linear rate instead O.o
2011-07-31T10:57:02  <bhasker> yup
2011-07-31T10:57:27  <bhasker> so your bot will lose if it goes against a bot that collects food better
2011-07-31T10:57:30  <bhasker> it will just grow too fast
2011-07-31T10:57:35  <Hjax> ill have it make a list of all the targets and only send 1 ant to get food and still do the wall tactic to kill enemies
2011-07-31T10:57:51  <bhasker> i guess that would work
2011-07-31T10:58:04  <bhasker> but what i see most top bots doing is something like keeping 100% visibility of the map
2011-07-31T10:58:13  <Hjax> heres an example of my bot being out produced: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=115171&user=10
2011-07-31T10:58:16  <bhasker> so they grow in a way that maximizes visible area
2011-07-31T10:58:21  <bhasker> when no food is around
2011-07-31T10:58:58  <bhasker> yea that bot out grew yours really fast
2011-07-31T10:59:20  <Hjax> the problem with that is that if some bot gets a good formation going they can destroy bots that spread out too much
2011-07-31T11:01:18  <Hjax> i need to add some form of pathfinding around water

2011-07-31T11:04:06  <fgump> a  bot?
2011-07-31T11:04:24  <Hjax> did you write an ai for ants yet?
2011-07-31T11:04:41  <fgump> ah, i was looking at the wrong channel name!
2011-07-31T11:05:08  <fgump> no, not yet. didn't know the challenge was finalized
2011-07-31T11:05:49  <Hjax> its not, doesnt mean you can;t play with the beta
2011-07-31T11:06:46  <fgump> cool. guess i'll start working on it once my dissertation is over
2011-07-31T11:07:54  <bhasker> hjax they can't destroy you
2011-07-31T11:07:58  <bhasker> if they can't catch you
2011-07-31T11:08:19  <bhasker> the top bots don't do any formations till like late gaem
2011-07-31T11:08:25  <bhasker> once most of the map is known
2011-07-31T11:08:32  <bhasker> the time you are chasing down one of his ants
2011-07-31T11:08:40  <bhasker> his other ants will be growing his numbers exponentially
2011-07-31T11:08:46  <bhasker> and you will not be growing
2011-07-31T11:08:58  <Hjax> bhasker, you wouldn't happen to know why it keeps spitting out a syntax error complaining about some code that doesnt exist?
2011-07-31T11:09:01  <Hjax> goog point
2011-07-31T11:09:06  <Hjax> good*
2011-07-31T11:09:28  <bhasker> most bots seem to avoid combat in early game
2011-07-31T11:09:54  <Hjax> as of right now my bot charges at any enemy ant it sees, which can be stupid
2011-07-31T11:10:02  <bhasker> going around formations is really easy early game as no one has enough ants to blockade
2011-07-31T11:10:09  <bhasker> food before enemy
2011-07-31T11:10:28  <bhasker> and try to avoid combat till you have grown to a certain point
2011-07-31T11:10:33  <Hjax> i cant fix my bot it it wont compile serverside :/
2011-07-31T11:10:42  <bhasker> ah
2011-07-31T11:11:54  <Hjax> it keeps complaining that i referenced move_list, which doesnt exist. but ctrl f is only finding me referencing movelist. a list that i already created
2011-07-31T11:12:50  <bhasker> hmm cant help without really looking at the code
2011-07-31T11:13:16  <Hjax> ill pastebin it, no real secrets in it atm
2011-07-31T11:24:23  <Hjax> so i need to add some better pathfinding, make my bot grow faster, fix it warring too often

2011-07-31T17:10:35  <martinording> hi
2011-07-31T17:10:56  <martinording> does anyone know where i can download the maps called height_map_1, _2 etc?
2011-07-31T17:11:26  <martinording> they look interesting and i would like to use them for local testing
2011-07-31T17:12:15  <amstan> martinording: where did you see those?
2011-07-31T17:12:23  <amstan> you can try something like http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/maps/
2011-07-31T17:12:33  <amstan> oh.. http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/map/
2011-07-31T17:12:40  <martinording> top bots  seem to play on them all the time: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=7
2011-07-31T17:12:45  <martinording> ok, thanks
2011-07-31T17:13:09  <martinording> they ought to be included in the tools package
2011-07-31T17:14:06  <amstan> no, because we'll add more maps as the contest progresses
2011-07-31T17:14:19  <amstan> tools should only be released if there's new tools
2011-07-31T17:14:30  <martinording> ok
2011-07-31T17:14:46  <martinording> then there should be a link to the maps, when clicking on a map in the website
2011-07-31T17:15:19  <martinording> such as here: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/map.php?map=height_map/height_map_11.map
