2011-05-03T00:47:30  <antimatroid> i haz worked out how to define symmetry and find it i think
2011-05-03T00:49:37  <jaycobcoleman> you mean so we can tell the engine how to place food for a particular map?
2011-05-03T00:49:58  <antimatroid> no, a general definition for a normal form game to be symmetric
2011-05-03T00:50:12  <jaycobcoleman> oh, okay
2011-05-03T00:53:26  <jaycobcoleman> what is required to make it symmetric?
2011-05-03T00:54:08  <antimatroid> you want my current definition?
2011-05-03T00:54:15  <antimatroid> first i need to define a couple of things for you

2011-05-03T00:54:30  <jaycobcoleman> alright
2011-05-03T00:55:08  <antimatroid> if I have each players strategy sets A1, ..., An, a link up of those is a set of (a1,...,an) tuples so that no ai is in any tuple more than once
2011-05-03T00:55:37  <antimatroid> so say you have A1={b1,b2} and A2={c1,c2}, a partition might be (b1,c2) and (b2,c1)
2011-05-03T00:56:39  <antimatroid> this induces a matrix of permutations p_ij:A_i->A_j, where each p_ii just maps each strategy to itself, and you have p_jk compose p_ij = p_ik for all i,j,k
2011-05-03T00:57:43  <antimatroid> then a game where every player has the same number of strategies is symmetric of there exists such a link up of the strategy sets there exists such a p so that for every permutation of the players, say q, you have
2011-05-03T00:58:47  <antimatroid> u_i(s1, ..., sn) = u_q(i)(p_q^-1(1),1(s_q^-1(1))....) for all i and (s1,...,sn) :P
2011-05-03T01:02:29  <antimatroid> make sense? :P
2011-05-03T01:02:46  <jaycobcoleman> sorry, I was making food :P
2011-05-03T01:02:52  <jaycobcoleman> I'll have to study this for a second
2011-05-03T01:03:10  <antimatroid> i would be very surprised if you can make sense of that :p
2011-05-03T01:09:02  <jaycobcoleman> Yeah I'm pretty confused. Haha, nice try though
2011-05-03T01:09:21  <antimatroid> that problem has been bugging me for over a year
2011-05-03T01:09:27  <antimatroid> and i've been wrestling with it for like a week
2011-05-03T01:09:32  <antimatroid> it's nice to work it out
2011-05-03T01:10:54  <jaycobcoleman> I don't understand the idea of breaking apart strategy sets, or really defining strategy sets in general
2011-05-03T01:11:44  <antimatroid> take a single ant in ants
2011-05-03T01:11:57  <antimatroid> it's strategy set on a turn is the set of directions that don't result in them landing in water
2011-05-03T01:11:57  <jaycobcoleman> following
2011-05-03T01:12:10  <antimatroid> so maybe {N, E, S, W, X} (X == nowhere)
2011-05-03T01:12:17  <jaycobcoleman> still following
2011-05-03T01:12:54  <antimatroid> if I had the ants game say a.b, the sets would be {X, E} and {W, X}
2011-05-03T01:13:16  <antimatroid> my linking to find symmetry would be (X,X) and (E,W)
2011-05-03T01:13:31  <jaycobcoleman> following
2011-05-03T01:13:54  <antimatroid> then p_ij(X) = X, p_ij(E/W) = W/E
2011-05-03T01:14:17  <antimatroid> a permutation of the players might be q(1) = 2 and q(2) = 1
2011-05-03T01:14:32  <antimatroid> then plug all that stuff in with assigned utility values and you will find it all holds
2011-05-03T01:15:15  <antimatroid> but this definition will work for any n player game where all players have the same number of strategies
2011-05-03T01:15:57  <jaycobcoleman> sweet. Breakin new ground
2011-05-03T01:21:03  <jaycobcoleman> Planning on going anywhere interesting with this newfound knowledge?
2011-05-03T01:39:03  <antimatroid> yeah, keep poking around to see what i find
2011-05-03T01:39:19  <antimatroid> i've pretty much decided to do my honours thesis on "some structure properties of games"
2011-05-03T01:45:39  <jaycobcoleman> The idea of writing what's equivalent to a small book on any topic is pretty daunting to me
2011-05-03T01:45:54  <jaycobcoleman> I'm having enough trouble at the moment writing a 10 page paper
2011-05-03T01:46:34  <antimatroid> it's not very hard once you actually play around quite a bit
2011-05-03T01:46:56  <antimatroid> it doesn't necessarily need to be one small specific question/topic either
2011-05-03T01:48:23  <jaycobcoleman> It's pretty hard when I'm supposed to be writing about joseph conrad's works as being interpreted from a political standpoint :P Not really an English person
2011-05-03T01:55:41  <jaycobcoleman> I made the mistake of taking difficult English courses simply because I'm a relatively good writer and because I needed more classes, failing to take into the account the fact that I don't do work that strikes me as particularly boring
2011-05-03T01:56:57  <jaycobcoleman> I thought, I have to take an English course...might as well take one I can get college credit for!
2011-05-03T01:57:11  <jaycobcoleman> stupid me. Stupid stupid me.

2011-05-03T07:33:37  <antimatroid> the movie
2011-05-03T07:33:46  <antimatroid> it's the second most seeded somethingerather :P on a website atm
2011-05-03T07:33:51  <antimatroid> and i have no idea why
2011-05-03T07:34:04  <sigh> I haven't heard of it... oh well
2011-05-03T07:36:32  <antimatroid> it's an alright movie
2011-05-03T07:36:34  <antimatroid> reasonably old though
2011-05-03T07:37:11  <sigh> 2007 is reasonable old now? :P
2011-05-03T07:39:52  <antimatroid> yes
2011-05-03T07:40:38  <sigh> reminds me of this http://xkcd.com/891/ :P

2011-05-03T07:56:52  <mcstar> i had a problem last night
2011-05-03T07:57:03  <mcstar> they said i should ask you
2011-05-03T07:57:11  <sigh> haha
2011-05-03T07:57:15  <mcstar> it is regarding "end"
2011-05-03T07:57:30  <mcstar> i looked at engine.py
2011-05-03T07:57:34  *** Frontier <Frontier!~Marco@dslb-088-070-155-076.pools.arcor-ip.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-03T07:57:43  <mcstar> and at the end of the game the code runs
2011-05-03T07:57:50  <mcstar> which supposed to tell the bots this:
2011-05-03T07:57:52  <mcstar> end
2011-05-03T07:57:54  <mcstar> players 3
2011-05-03T07:57:58  <mcstar> score 4 5 6
2011-05-03T07:58:00  <mcstar> go
2011-05-03T07:58:06  <mcstar> but
2011-05-03T07:58:21  <mcstar> not a single bot can pipe these lines to sderr
2011-05-03T07:58:38  <mcstar> bc they dont receive it
2011-05-03T07:58:55  <mcstar> or are their pipes shut off before they can output it?
2011-05-03T07:58:59  <sigh> ok, so the bug is that the bots aren't receiving those lines?
2011-05-03T07:59:04  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-05-03T07:59:07  <mcstar> i cant know that
2011-05-03T07:59:16  <mcstar> they cant output it to stderr
2011-05-03T07:59:21  <mcstar> thats for sure
2011-05-03T07:59:36  <mcstar> but i beleive they dont receive it yes
2011-05-03T07:59:39  <mcstar> because
2011-05-03T07:59:53  <mcstar> if a write my bot to end the game if it sees "end"
2011-05-03T08:00:00  <mcstar> then it timeouts in the last round
2011-05-03T08:00:16  <mcstar> but if i check with "turns" then its ok
2011-05-03T08:00:32  <mcstar> so yes porb. they dont get it
2011-05-03T08:00:45  <mcstar> but according to the code you send it to them
2011-05-03T08:01:00  <sigh> where does it get turns from?
2011-05-03T08:01:11  <mcstar> turn 0
2011-05-03T08:01:23  <mcstar> you send it in the initialization
2011-05-03T08:03:14  <mcstar> so
2011-05-03T08:03:23  <mcstar> i beleive the other bots dont terminate naturally
2011-05-03T08:03:34  <sigh> oh duh... I pause all the bots unless they are supposed to the running
2011-05-03T08:03:36  <sigh> hmmm
2011-05-03T08:04:30  <sigh> so yes... the bots aren't getting them because the engine SIGSTOPs them
2011-05-03T08:04:32  <mcstar> oh
2011-05-03T08:04:40  <sigh> the question is what to do
2011-05-03T08:04:45  <mcstar> so they dont run to process that
2011-05-03T08:05:07  <mcstar> well the question is
2011-05-03T08:05:09  <sigh> yeah...
2011-05-03T08:05:22  <mcstar> to you really want to send scores and players
2011-05-03T08:05:26  <mcstar> to->do
2011-05-03T08:05:28  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-03T08:05:59  <mcstar> janzert i beleive told me its pointless
2011-05-03T08:06:05  <sigh> if this is only an issue for development then we can just have a flag to run in non-strict mode where the bots can run even when we aren't timing them
2011-05-03T08:06:37  <sigh> the other option is to let the bots run a bit after the game has finished to let them clean up
2011-05-03T08:06:47  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-03T08:06:51  <mcstar> that would be good
2011-05-03T08:07:08  <mcstar> do you really need to send that stuff after "end"?
2011-05-03T08:07:25  <sigh> dunno, I didn't come up with the specs
2011-05-03T08:07:32  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-03T08:07:36  <sigh> antimatroid, you know anything about this?
2011-05-03T08:09:40  <sigh> meh, I'll make an issue and see if people comment on it
2011-05-03T08:10:07  <mcstar> sry for the inconvenience :)
2011-05-03T08:10:21  <sigh> nah, it's a valid point
2011-05-03T08:10:36  <sigh> if it wasn't,  I would have just ignored it :P
2011-05-03T08:10:45  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-03T08:10:56  <mcstar> im just surprised that nobody noticed it
2011-05-03T08:11:15  <mcstar> i usually dump IO to see if its ok

2011-05-03T12:31:40  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I agree, sigh convinced me
2011-05-03T12:31:41  <janzert> McLeopold: in what way?
2011-05-03T12:31:53  <McLeopold> WindowsError: [Error 3] The system cannot find the path specified: '/srv/chroot/*.*'
2011-05-03T12:32:38  <janzert> ok, you must have a server_info.py in the worker but the jailuser chroots are not setup
2011-05-03T12:33:19  <McLeopold> I'm thinking true jail users should be off be default, only when you add the correct option to the play_game.py does it use them
2011-05-03T12:33:25  <janzert> it's a sandbox safety feature that if it finds a server_info module it defaults to secure mode
2011-05-03T12:33:50  <janzert> if there is no server_info it defaults to not using jails
2011-05-03T12:34:09  <McLeopold> I'm in ants running play_one_game, so no server_info?
2011-05-03T12:34:33  <janzert> but it is still using the sandbox from the worker directory
2011-05-03T12:34:39  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-03T12:35:03  <janzert> we should add an optional value in server_info to overide the sandbox security
2011-05-03T12:35:11  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-03T12:35:25  <janzert> but the default should stay the way it is ;)
2011-05-03T12:36:17  <tvorryn> antimatroid: i might use your C++ bot as a base for my final iterations, but right now I'm experimenting using Java (less to think about, memory management etc.)
2011-05-03T12:37:02  <antimatroid> tvorryn: the only time I ever need to "delete" memory with a c++ bot is when clearing a game tree
2011-05-03T12:37:13  <janzert> McLeopold: try changine line 14 of sandbox.py to "_SECURE_DEFAULT = server_info.get("secure_jail", True)"

2011-05-03T12:42:32  <McLeopold> run_game is returning None
2011-05-03T12:42:35  <janzert> you will need to set "secure_jail", False in server_info.py of course

2011-05-03T12:44:50  <McLeopold> no, run_game from the worker.py returns None

2011-05-03T12:45:33  <janzert> that run_game is from engine.py?
2011-05-03T12:45:46  <janzert> looks like anyway
2011-05-03T12:46:07  <janzert> and run_game has no explicit return statement
2011-05-03T12:46:47  <McLeopold> I think I need to look at the git history then, because it is suppose to return a json result
2011-05-03T12:47:35  <janzert> yeah, it certainly doesn't anymore
2011-05-03T12:47:44  <McLeopold> I bet logging got mixed it with the json stuff at some point

2011-05-03T12:59:59  <janzert> just enough to figure out where to and the sandbox.release() call ;)
2011-05-03T13:00:08  <janzert> where to put it even
2011-05-03T13:00:13  <McLeopold> play_game is the command line tool for testing, worker.py is what uses it in the tournament, neither is using it in a shell
2011-05-03T13:03:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid: any opinion on engine.py needing stdout?
2011-05-03T13:03:16  <janzert> I guess I can see where run locally it would be nice to output ongoing game information to the console though
2011-05-03T13:03:35  <janzert> but at least some of that information would be good to get returned to the worker for recording
2011-05-03T13:03:48  <janzert> e.g. the bot did not start
2011-05-03T13:04:03  <antimatroid> McLeopold: doesn't it usually output like "turn x"?

2011-05-03T13:04:28  <McLeopold> yeah, but playgame should be doing the outputting, not engine.py
2011-05-03T13:04:30  <antimatroid> some people would probably like it if they could output using cerr
2011-05-03T13:05:04  <McLeopold> and I see "print >>" in the python code, wtf, this isn't c++

2011-05-03T13:06:10  <janzert> actually the whole print statement
2011-05-03T13:06:53  <antimatroid> although I do wish they had "template <class A> A& operator<<(A &a, ostream &os)" so you could have like if((a << cin) > 0)
2011-05-03T13:07:00  <janzert> the print >> syntax is something I have to look up almost everytime I want to use it in order to get it right

2011-05-03T13:07:23  <antimatroid> :p
2011-05-03T13:07:52  <McLeopold> janzert: I think python 3 still has print, doesn't it?
2011-05-03T13:08:03  <janzert> it's a built in function in python 3
2011-05-03T13:08:13  <McLeopold> oh, right, you need the ()
2011-05-03T13:08:15  <janzert> so print("message") instead of print "message"
2011-05-03T13:08:22  <McLeopold> print("WTF", sys.stderr)

2011-05-03T13:10:40  <janzert> amstan_: btw I ran into problems trying to get the worker using natty because haskell is broken on natty :(
2011-05-03T13:10:46  <janzert> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/haskell-platform/+bug/742052
2011-05-03T13:10:47  <McLeopold> janzert: I suppose I could turn run_game into a generator for stream output if you needed real time results
2011-05-03T13:11:00  <janzert> ick
2011-05-03T13:11:12  <McLeopold> you don't like the yield statement?
2011-05-03T13:11:21  <janzert> I'd rather have run_game just output stuff directly
2011-05-03T13:11:23  <amstan> janzert: we can use a ppa
2011-05-03T13:11:45  <janzert> less complicated and doesn't incur the performance overhead of a generator
2011-05-03T13:11:52  <McLeopold> well, with a generator, you don't have to play with processes
2011-05-03T13:11:56  <McLeopold> it's all python
2011-05-03T13:12:25  <janzert> but incurs rather large overhead anyway
2011-05-03T13:12:39  <janzert> not as large as seperate threads and syncing admittedly
2011-05-03T13:13:06  <janzert> amstan: we'll need to find something I suppose
2011-05-03T13:13:48  <janzert> McLeopold: and even without the performance penalty it complicates the control flow and ability to reason about the code
2011-05-03T13:15:43  <amstan> janzert: broken how?
2011-05-03T13:16:09  <amstan> i see it's the same version as maverick: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=haskell-platform
2011-05-03T13:16:33  * janzert shrugs
2011-05-03T13:16:48  <janzert> it works in maverick, but throws that error in natty
2011-05-03T13:17:28  <amstan> how do i test it?
2011-05-03T13:17:43  <janzert> apt-get install haskell-platform

2011-05-03T13:18:12  <janzert> I think the ghc dependency just needs to be changed in the package so hopefully it gets fixed soon
2011-05-03T13:20:06  <amstan> janzert: so.. this:  haskell-platform : Depends: ghc6 (< 6.12.1+) but 6.12.3-1ubuntu7 is to be installed
2011-05-03T13:20:15  <janzert> right
2011-05-03T13:20:35  <janzert> see the launchpad bug I linked to above
2011-05-03T13:21:28  <janzert> this does remind me that we need a way to specify to specify somewhere what languages are actually available

2011-05-03T13:22:23  <janzert> since compile_anything will probably be able to handle languages that aren't actually installed
2011-05-03T13:23:04  <amstan> janzert: yeah, i guess
2011-05-03T13:23:36  <amstan> besides that, is the worker stuff done?
2011-05-03T13:23:53  <janzert> I still need to get compilation sandboxed
2011-05-03T13:23:58  <janzert> not sure what else is needed
2011-05-03T13:24:33  <amstan> i would concentrate on that for now
2011-05-03T13:24:33  <janzert> certainly McLeopold just found that the engine doesn't return game results to the worker anymore
2011-05-03T13:24:38  <amstan> we have to get a beta up
2011-05-03T13:26:45  <amstan> janzert: would installing from source be a problem?
2011-05-03T13:26:49  <amstan> for haskell?
2011-05-03T13:27:57  <janzert> I'd rather not, but if someone writes the necessary setup script function to do it we probably could

2011-05-03T13:44:25  <jmcarthur> yeah when i was first informed of that the ai contest is the first thing i thought of
2011-05-03T13:44:33  <jmcarthur> i wasn't sure if you guys were going to go with natty or not
2011-05-03T13:44:42  <amstan> jmcarthur: how did you solve it? please don'
2011-05-03T13:44:46  <amstan> don't say source, lol
2011-05-03T13:44:47  <jmcarthur> i don't use ubuntu
2011-05-03T13:44:51  <amstan> aww!
2011-05-03T13:44:55  <amstan> even worse then
2011-05-03T13:45:03  <jmcarthur> you could maybe create a package yourself
2011-05-03T13:45:09  <jmcarthur> so that you don't have to rebuild on every worker
2011-05-03T13:45:16  <jmcarthur> i don't know how to do that though
2011-05-03T13:45:30  <amstan> but we'll have no idea if it's stable or not
2011-05-03T13:45:37  <jmcarthur> hmm?
2011-05-03T13:45:45  <amstan> janzert: do you have experience with rolling your own debs?
2011-05-03T13:45:53  <janzert> nope :/
2011-05-03T13:45:57  <amstan> jmcarthur: we need someone to test it
2011-05-03T13:46:14  <jmcarthur> i've only ever rolled a deb for the linux kernel, and there's a special tool for that, so i know nothing about rolling a deb :\
2011-05-03T13:46:33  <janzert> maybe best (and most likely) thing will be if the ppa's catch up to natty soon
2011-05-03T13:46:35  <jmcarthur> i'd be willing to set up a vm and give it a little stress test if somebody else can figure out how to make the deb
2011-05-03T13:47:10  <janzert> then we could probably get ghc7 as well
2011-05-03T13:47:25  <janzert> no real idea if that is desirable though
2011-05-03T13:47:47  <janzert> except that 7 > 6 :P
2011-05-03T13:47:51  <jmcarthur> i highly recommend ghc7
2011-05-03T13:48:03  <jmcarthur> 6 is okay as long as it is 6.12.3
2011-05-03T13:48:20  <amstan> i got Glasgow Haskell Compiler, Version 6.12.3, for Haskell 98, stage 2 booted by GHC version 6.12.3
2011-05-03T13:48:26  <amstan> the one from the repo
2011-05-03T13:48:27  <jmcarthur> but i don't think 6.12.3 was ever officially supported by ubuntu
2011-05-03T13:48:34  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-05-03T13:48:40  <janzert> 6.12.3 is what is in natty, but the haskell-platform package still depends on < 6.12.1
2011-05-03T13:48:49  <jmcarthur> yuck!
2011-05-03T13:49:07  <janzert> right, which is what breaks the package from installing
2011-05-03T13:49:10  <amstan> i was thinking of doing this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=977166
2011-05-03T13:49:51  <amstan> jmcarthur: so.. would there be compatibility problems even if we do override that version thing? or sould we just forget and get a new haskell-platform
2011-05-03T13:49:54  <jmcarthur> ah yeah editing the existing package might be a good idea
2011-05-03T13:49:58  <jmcarthur> err
2011-05-03T13:50:00  <jmcarthur> oh nevermind
2011-05-03T13:50:08  <jmcarthur> there would indeed be compatibility problems
2011-05-03T13:50:52  <jmcarthur> ghc doesn't do whole program optimization, but it has a heavy cross-module inliner which is updated a lot, so libraries have to be built with the same version of ghc
2011-05-03T13:50:56  <tvorryn> where are you guys using haskell? i wanted to use it for a bot but there is no starter package, which bummed me out
2011-05-03T13:51:15  <jmcarthur> tvorryn: i had made the beginnings of a library for starters, but it's way overengineered
2011-05-03T13:51:23  <jmcarthur> and now i don't have time to work on it
2011-05-03T13:52:04  <jmcarthur> tvorryn: haskell is a regular contender in this contest though, so even if mine isn't used, somebody will probably make a starter at some point
2011-05-03T13:52:20  <tvorryn> ahh, ok
2011-05-03T13:52:42  <tvorryn> so I'll be lazy and let someone else do it ...
2011-05-03T13:53:14  <tvorryn> although maybe a friend would be interested in giving it a go
2011-05-03T13:53:20  <jmcarthur> any debian guys here? does debian have a decent haskell-platform package, or is it just the same as ubuntu's?
2011-05-03T13:53:31  <jmcarthur> might be able to just rip debian's package and use it
2011-05-03T13:53:50  <amstan> jmcarthur: http://packages.debian.org/sid/haskell-platform
2011-05-03T13:54:38  <jmcarthur> amstan: that looks pretty good to me
2011-05-03T13:55:39  <jmcarthur> even more up to date than the arch package
2011-05-03T13:56:36  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure how ripping metapackages from debian and using them in ubuntu would work
2011-05-03T13:58:57  <jmcarthur> amstan: i will take any future conversation about this in #haskell where others might be able to help too
2011-05-03T13:59:03  <jmcarthur> but i have nothing to add for now
2011-05-03T13:59:19  <amstan> jmcarthur: i tried, they seem to think building from source would be best
2011-05-03T13:59:28  <jmcarthur> somebody suggested the debian sid packages
2011-05-03T14:00:04  <jmcarthur> i read that conversation. i wouldn't say there were enough people to have any sort of consensus ;)
2011-05-03T14:02:13  <amstan> well.. the #ubuntu guys really advise against using the debian repo for haskell

2011-05-03T14:35:00  <jmcarthur> it was downloading
2011-05-03T14:35:05  <amstan> what?>
2011-05-03T14:35:07  <jmcarthur> i was intending from that same ppa

2011-05-03T14:35:54  <jmcarthur> i had just tweaked /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mbeloborodiy-ppa-natty.list which had "src" instead of "deb" at the beginning of a line for some reason...
2011-05-03T14:36:03  <jmcarthur> and was trying again
2011-05-03T14:36:18  <jmcarthur> appeared to be working, but maybe it had something to do with your debian stuff
2011-05-03T14:36:27  <jmcarthur> ah yeah
2011-05-03T14:36:30  <jmcarthur> it was sid stuff, nevermind
2011-05-03T14:36:35  <jmcarthur> nothing installed
2011-05-03T14:36:48  <amstan> hmm.. let's see
2011-05-03T14:37:12  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah.. it was sid stuff, i just did your ppa stuff again, and it doesn't work
2011-05-03T14:37:18  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-05-03T14:37:18  <amstan> so i'll remove the ppa, and add sid back

2011-05-03T14:37:58  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-05-03T14:38:13  <jmcarthur> would be nice to be able to take a lock on it manually
2011-05-03T14:38:17  <jmcarthur> would just have to remember to unlock it

2011-05-03T14:38:51  <jmcarthur> we shall see

2011-05-03T14:39:26  <jmcarthur> ah yeah
2011-05-03T14:39:34  <jmcarthur> the stupid haskell platform has opengl stuff
2011-05-03T14:39:36  <jmcarthur> i hate that
2011-05-03T14:39:57  <jmcarthur> we could select some of the platforms dependencies manually instead, maybe
2011-05-03T14:40:01  <jmcarthur> just all but opengl?
2011-05-03T14:40:27  <amstan> jmcarthur: well.. haskell-platform is a metapackage
2011-05-03T14:40:37  <amstan> we don't have to install it.. we can just install its dependencies
2011-05-03T14:40:41  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-05-03T14:40:47  <jmcarthur> all except opengl
2011-05-03T14:41:01  <jmcarthur> and glut of course
2011-05-03T14:41:10  <jmcarthur> (i think glut is a dep, anyway...)
2011-05-03T14:43:03  <amstan> http://pastebin.com/iBNjrAud
2011-05-03T14:43:09  <amstan> so... delete the ones you don't need
2011-05-03T14:43:26  <jmcarthur> heh i was already looking at that
2011-05-03T14:43:50  <amstan> i emptied /var/cache/apt/archives
2011-05-03T14:43:58  <amstan> and when i apt-get the other ones.. it'll put the debs there
2011-05-03T14:44:18  <amstan> so i can just get them and use them again without doing it so hackly with the sid repo in apt
2011-05-03T14:44:33  <amstan> maybe make a ppa out of them
2011-05-03T14:44:39  <jmcarthur> ah i see
2011-05-03T14:44:59  <McLeopold> janzert: when I run an sql statement in php I get 0 rows.  I'm logging the sql statement and when I run it in mysql I get 1 row.
2011-05-03T14:45:14  <jmcarthur> should i remove more than just opengl and glut? there are some libraries i don't foresee anybody using in the contest
2011-05-03T14:45:19  <jmcarthur> xhtml for example
2011-05-03T14:45:50  <jmcarthur> wait why is this saying ghc6?
2011-05-03T14:45:54  <GreenTea> enybody has any astimations when contest will be started?
2011-05-03T14:46:40  <GreenTea> * estimations
2011-05-03T14:47:22  <amstan> jmcarthur: yes.. do that
2011-05-03T14:47:36  <jmcarthur> we don't want these ghc6 packages though
2011-05-03T14:47:44  <amstan> jmcarthur: it seems to be using ghc6.12
2011-05-03T14:47:49  <amstan> .1
2011-05-03T14:47:51  <jmcarthur> i have a different listing from  apt-cache depends haskell-platform
2011-05-03T14:48:10  <amstan> i used apt-rdepends
2011-05-03T14:48:32  <jmcarthur> reverse depends?
2011-05-03T14:48:38  <amstan> no
2011-05-03T14:48:46  <amstan> apt-rdepends - performs recursive dependency listings similar to apt-cache
2011-05-03T14:48:51  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-05-03T14:49:04  <jmcarthur> in apt-cache, rdepends is reverse dependencies
2011-05-03T14:49:14  <amstan> recursive*
2011-05-03T14:50:17  <jmcarthur> well, these ghc6 packages aren't what we want. i'll use the apt-cache depends output

2011-05-03T14:59:11  <amstan> jmcarthur: pick the ones we want

2011-05-03T14:59:37  <jmcarthur> i don't want to remove too many of these packages because some of them might be things that people want to use locally and not have to remove from their source just to build on the server
2011-05-03T14:59:39  <GreenTea> ))
2011-05-03T14:59:53  <amstan> jmcarthur: i don't think they need opengl locally

2011-05-03T15:00:28  <jmcarthur> come to think of it a web interface to my bot would be pretty cool ;)
2011-05-03T15:01:02  <jmcarthur> not running on the server, mind you
2011-05-03T15:01:08  <jmcarthur> or a worker
2011-05-03T15:01:30  <amstan> jmcarthur: do we need libgmp3 upgraded?
2011-05-03T15:02:30  <jmcarthur> it's asking to upgrade libgmp? interesting.
2011-05-03T15:03:16  <jmcarthur> the Integer type used to use gmp by default but i thought they went to a pure haskell implementation since then
2011-05-03T15:03:30  <jmcarthur> it's still a compile-time flag though, so maybe the debian one is built for gmp
2011-05-03T15:04:23  <amstan> or gcc
2011-05-03T15:04:34  <amstan> well.. i give up with synaptic
2011-05-03T15:04:56  <amstan> i was hoping i can install haskell-platform, and then unselect all the annoying dependencies and it'll keep only what we wanted
2011-05-03T15:05:04  <amstan> but it doesn't seem to let me unselect them
2011-05-03T15:07:21  <jmcarthur> https://gist.github.com/953990
2011-05-03T15:07:29  <jmcarthur> does that look scary to you?
2011-05-03T15:08:48  <amstan> jmcarthur: let me check each one of those
2011-05-03T15:08:50  <jmcarthur> looks like libgmp is not used without ghc anyway
2011-05-03T15:08:59  <jmcarthur> according to the top
2011-05-03T15:09:07  <jmcarthur> so upgrading it shouldn't be a problem at all i think
2011-05-03T15:10:06  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah, i was wondering about that
2011-05-03T15:11:23  <amstan> jmcarthur: what about zlib1g?
2011-05-03T15:11:49  <amstan> jmcarthur: also.. let me make an autoremove
2011-05-03T15:11:56  <amstan> so we have all dependent packages
2011-05-03T15:12:19  <jmcarthur> zlib is require for the zlib haskell package. we could remove that if you think it worth removing
2011-05-03T15:12:22  <jmcarthur> *required
2011-05-03T15:12:53  <amstan> this is what autoremove gets me: binutils cpp-4.4 g++-4.4 gcc gcc-4.4 gcc-4.4-base gcc-4.5 libbsd-dev libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libffi-dev libgmp3-dev libgomp1 libstdc++6-4.4-dev linux-libc-dev manpages-dev
2011-05-03T15:13:04  <amstan> i'll remove libgmp
2011-05-03T15:13:29  <jmcarthur> heh, you might want to install build-essential so that gcc and stuff don't get autoremoved
2011-05-03T15:13:52  <amstan> why is that not installed yet?

2011-05-03T15:58:15  <janzert> it is the sources.list used for the chroot
2011-05-03T15:58:41  <amstan> doesn't it use the main worker sources.list

2011-05-03T15:59:27  <amstan> question.. how do you escape from ghci? lol
2011-05-03T15:59:49  <janzert> heh, I remember getting stuck in it before too but don't remember how I got out
2011-05-03T16:00:14  <amstan> ctrl+c does it.. but.. i wanted to know the quit command
2011-05-03T16:00:42  <amstan> well.. seems to be working
2011-05-03T16:00:47  <janzert> hmm, maybe I'm thinking of sbcl then. 'cause I don't think ctrl-c did it
2011-05-03T16:01:20  * janzert wonders if we could find a ppa for nodejs or golang as well
2011-05-03T16:01:35  <janzert> although a quick search doesn't seem promising for natty at this point
2011-05-03T16:02:17  <janzert> ooh, https://launchpad.net/~cz.nic-labs/+archive/golang just updated 4 hours ago for golang
2011-05-03T16:06:01  <amstan> ctrl+c doesn't work in python either, it wants ctrl+d
2011-05-03T16:06:17  <janzert> yep, or exit() :)
2011-05-03T16:07:28  <janzert> and ctrl+d won't work under windows since it is looking for the EOF character and that ctrl+z under windows if I remember correctly
2011-05-03T16:07:39  <amstan> Zannick: ok.. so i have a ton of .deb files for installing haskell
2011-05-03T16:07:42  <amstan> janzert: *
2011-05-03T16:07:43  <amstan> now what..
2011-05-03T16:08:03  <amstan> i already used them
2011-05-03T16:08:07  <amstan> i'm thinking for other comps
2011-05-03T16:08:24  <janzert> write a python function that goes through the steps of downloading and then installing them :/
2011-05-03T16:08:48  <amstan> maybe make a ppa
2011-05-03T16:09:00  <janzert> sure that'd be even better
2011-05-03T16:09:36  <Mjothvitnir> Is there an approximate start date?

2011-05-03T17:06:34  <jmcarthur> amstan: that "cat packages | sudo xargs apt-get install" output looks reasonable to me. if you really wanted to cut down on dependencies we could cut out some more libraries, but like i said earlier, i'm a little hesitant to do so because i think it would be best to just be able to say the server has the platform minus opengl

2011-05-03T18:25:21  <Frontier> pong
2011-05-03T18:28:22  <McLeopold> Frontier: I wanted to talk about the replay format
2011-05-03T18:29:43  <Frontier> McLeopold: Ok, what is it?
2011-05-03T18:29:58  <McLeopold> it looks like you have an object with just challenge, replayformat and replay
2011-05-03T18:30:08  <McLeopold> inside the replay you have another object with the game specific stuff
2011-05-03T18:30:31  <McLeopold> what does replayformat=storage mean?  what other values would it have?
2011-05-03T18:31:32  <Frontier> "streaming" was in my head for a while until we switched to json for good. now i don't know really.
2011-05-03T18:32:25  <McLeopold> streaming could still exist though
2011-05-03T18:32:36  <Frontier> i'm still thinking of the whole thing as a container with metadata that contains replay data that could be played back on its own.
2011-05-03T18:32:56  <Frontier> streaming could exist, but it really doesn't make much sense in a json object which is parsed as a whole
2011-05-03T18:33:02  <McLeopold> true
2011-05-03T18:33:26  <McLeopold> but the string could be feed into something that could render results per turn

2011-05-03T18:34:28  <Frontier> well, the visualiser does render stuff per turn. it will just always load the complete json object into memory before playing back
2011-05-03T18:34:34  <sigh> what happened?
2011-05-03T18:34:39  <McLeopold> sigh: I think we need to get on the same page about how the engine should work
2011-05-03T18:34:51  <sigh> what part is broken?
2011-05-03T18:35:03  <McLeopold> The engine had the option to return a dictionary, which worker was using...
2011-05-03T18:35:18  <McLeopold> you changed to do to stuff on stdout and stderr instead
2011-05-03T18:35:41  <McLeopold> when you have time, we should talk about what the engine should be doing
2011-05-03T18:35:55  <sigh> oh ok, then it's easy we just return the dictionary always

2011-05-03T18:37:17  <McLeopold> yep, that's the only problem
2011-05-03T18:37:25  <sigh> if you are doing streaming from the engine, you might as well handle all output there
2011-05-03T18:37:32  <McLeopold> I suggested a generator, but janzert didn't like that
2011-05-03T18:38:04  <McLeopold> My goal was to keep the engine.py as a python module only, not to be used as a process

2011-05-03T18:38:38  <McLeopold> playgame would be the command line interface you would use if you wanted process output and redirection stuff
2011-05-03T18:39:02  <McLeopold> then worker could hook directly to the engine and only need to know about python, not processes or parsing
2011-05-03T18:39:27  <McLeopold> I think yield is the only way to get ongoing results from a function?
2011-05-03T18:39:36  <McLeopold> Unless we go with threading?
2011-05-03T18:39:39  <janzert> why does the worker need ongoing results?
2011-05-03T18:39:43  <sigh> you can use callbacks
2011-05-03T18:39:47  <McLeopold> for the streaming format
2011-05-03T18:39:49  <janzert> you can also use..
2011-05-03T18:39:52  <janzert> yes callbacks
2011-05-03T18:40:00  <McLeopold> oh, yeah, great idea
2011-05-03T18:40:01  <sigh> yeild is not so good
2011-05-03T18:40:07  <janzert> the worker is going to stream something?
2011-05-03T18:40:19  <McLeopold> janzert: for tcp, someday, yes
2011-05-03T18:40:36  <janzert> but that won't be the present worker.py anyway right?
2011-05-03T18:40:43  <McLeopold> tcp would hook directly to the engine and pass the streaming format to listeners
2011-05-03T18:40:59  <McLeopold> janzert: no, tcp and worker would be different and want different results
2011-05-03T18:41:10  <janzert> certainly the current engine doesn't output anything useful for a streaming game result anyway
2011-05-03T18:41:16  <sigh> anyway, if anything implement it with callbacks
2011-05-03T18:41:32  <McLeopold> sigh: Okay, I like the callback idea, I think I'll move printing from the engine to playgame

2011-05-03T18:42:46  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@210.18.207.102> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-05-03T18:43:23  <McLeopold> janzert: we had a streaming format, which was the original replay format.  It's not to hard to revive when I get tcp going
2011-05-03T18:45:41  <janzert> yes and for that a callback makes sense but for informational message printing is there a reason to use a callback rather than just a setting to turn it on or off?
2011-05-03T18:47:39  <janzert> btw, I don't think anything should ever be trying to reparse them and use for some other purpose than human consumption
2011-05-03T18:48:03  <janzert> if that is needed the information *should* be passed in some other way
2011-05-03T18:49:20  <McLeopold> I don't know if I fully understand your question
2011-05-03T18:50:09  <janzert> from what I saw the current printing in engine.py is just informational message to basically let the person watching know how the game is progressing
2011-05-03T18:50:27  <McLeopold> oh, but it is playgame that should be printing, not engine
2011-05-03T18:50:30  <janzert> I think that is fine just to let it print directly in engine
2011-05-03T18:50:41  <McLeopold> so, playgame should pass a file object to engine if it needs the info
2011-05-03T18:51:16  <McLeopold> worker doesn't need printing, so it doesn't make sense to put it there
2011-05-03T18:51:21  <janzert> and if playgame needs the information for something other than printing then we shouldn't be sending it in strings anyway
2011-05-03T18:51:35  <janzert> that's what the verbose parameter to disable it is for
2011-05-03T18:51:38  <McLeopold> the only other need is logging
2011-05-03T18:51:44  <McLeopold> which would still be string format
2011-05-03T18:52:42  <janzert> yes, if you want to make it loggable then something other than bare print statements would be good
2011-05-03T18:53:06  <janzert> in that case I'd say the python logging module should be used :/
2011-05-03T18:53:11  <McLeopold> so, the point is for engine to be python only, so stderr or stdout, any other python tool can use it
2011-05-03T18:53:26  <McLeopold> *no* stderr/out
2011-05-03T18:53:59  <janzert> if verbose is false then I agree, no stderr/out
2011-05-03T18:54:05  <McLeopold> if you want to use it in an environment that wants to do piping and stuff, then use playgame, the command line interface to it
2011-05-03T18:54:16  <janzert> i.e. I'm think it is fine so long as there is a way to stop it from printing anything out
2011-05-03T18:55:03  <McLeopold> well, do you think it is bad to remove it?  which is my plan
2011-05-03T18:55:05  <janzert> just don't complicate it when the only use is going to be printing it out anyway
2011-05-03T18:55:54  <McLeopold> I think overall it will be simpler

2011-05-03T19:30:22  <mcstar> huh
2011-05-03T19:30:29  <mcstar> my random bot is finished
2011-05-03T19:31:01  <mcstar> but
2011-05-03T19:31:06  <mcstar> i noticed something
2011-05-03T19:31:23  <mcstar> is it possible that 2 ants of a kind annihilate each other?
2011-05-03T19:31:52  <mcstar> for example if they want to make conflicting moves
2011-05-03T19:33:56  <antimatroid> friend and enemy ants may collide
2011-05-03T19:34:13  <antimatroid> if more than one ant lands on the same square, all ants die and if enemies are in range, those enemies get points
2011-05-03T19:34:47  <mcstar> whoa
2011-05-03T19:34:50  <mcstar> alrighty
2011-05-03T19:35:16  <mcstar> and what about when for example i want to move my ant into water?
2011-05-03T19:35:28  <mcstar> will it cease to exist?
2011-05-03T19:35:35  <jaycobcoleman> it won't move
2011-05-03T19:35:38  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-03T19:35:39  <antimatroid> unfortunately
2011-05-03T19:35:40  <antimatroid> not
2011-05-03T19:35:44  <antimatroid> i wish it did kill it
2011-05-03T19:35:49  <jaycobcoleman> The engine will ignore it
2011-05-03T19:35:50  <mcstar> yeah? why?
2011-05-03T19:35:54  <antimatroid> McLeopold: can we have ants walking onto water kill them?
2011-05-03T19:36:03  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: I agree completely
2011-05-03T19:36:07  <antimatroid> otherwise it's quite easy for people to be making stupid moves and not even know it
2011-05-03T19:36:58  <mcstar> i dont know, those ants will save the worlds fresh water supply
2011-05-03T19:37:27  <jaycobcoleman> It's more realistic anyway :P
2011-05-03T19:37:39  <mcstar> so you suggest i program more logic than uniform random movement huh?
2011-05-03T19:37:48  <McLeopold> antimatroid: due to the scoring, I'd like to make it a bit harder to suicide
2011-05-03T19:38:37  <McLeopold> unless a suicide just gives everyone else a point....
2011-05-03T19:38:40  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-05-03T19:39:19  <antimatroid> suiciding is a valid strategy and already works if you have 2 ants there
2011-05-03T19:39:28  <McLeopold> that would be way easier than looking for enemy ants within distance of colliding ants
2011-05-03T19:39:31  <antimatroid> i would allow it and pass points on for ants dying on water
2011-05-03T19:39:44  <antimatroid> colliding enemies score points
2011-05-03T19:40:00  <antimatroid> it's if two friends suicide outside the battle range of lots of enemies that they're "helping" themselves
2011-05-03T19:40:08  <McLeopold> I prefer if your ant dies from anything but a battle, you lose a point
2011-05-03T19:40:20  <antimatroid> yeah, i would be down with that
2011-05-03T19:40:32  <McLeopold> I don't think suicide should be a valid strategy, and I'm willing to change the rules to ensure it isn't.
2011-05-03T19:40:36  <antimatroid> forces the "lame strategy" to pretty much be dominated
2011-05-03T19:41:03  <antimatroid> anyway, i need to head to uni :P
2011-05-03T19:41:15  <mcstar> its 1:39
2011-05-03T19:41:19  <mcstar> in the morning
2011-05-03T19:41:33  <mcstar> even the pubs are closed
2011-05-03T19:41:37  <antimatroid> 9 40am here :P
2011-05-03T19:41:46  <mcstar> yeah have a nice day
2011-05-03T19:42:01  <jaycobcoleman> see ya

2011-05-03T19:42:34  <McLeopold> @later tell sigh What do you think of colliding ants and ants walking into water just subtracting a point from your score?  Then we don't have to look for enemy ants in range of colliding ants.
2011-05-03T19:42:34  <contestbot> McLeopold: Job's done.
2011-05-03T19:42:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: plus you can get a negative score :D
2011-05-03T19:43:03  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I don't think assigining points is much of a problem
2011-05-03T19:43:10  <antimatroid> just treat them the same as the dead ants from battles
2011-05-03T19:43:22  <McLeopold> negative...score
2011-05-03T19:43:22  <antimatroid> i don't think you can get a negative score
2011-05-03T19:43:26  <antimatroid> you get a point for every ant
2011-05-03T19:43:30  <antimatroid> you can only lose that point
2011-05-03T19:43:39  <McLeopold> uh..
2011-05-03T19:44:14  <McLeopold> -2 points?
2011-05-03T19:44:24  <antimatroid> why do that?
2011-05-03T19:44:31  <McLeopold> then we can have a sub contest for most negative score :D
2011-05-03T19:44:36  <antimatroid> :p
2011-05-03T19:44:43  <antimatroid> i think -1 would do the trick
