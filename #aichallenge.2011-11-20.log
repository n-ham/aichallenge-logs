2011-11-20T01:43:55  <thestinger> python was just too slow
2011-11-20T01:45:25  <jab_bott> thestinger: well I tried BFS from the boundary of my know world and it gets far too slow far too quickly - I'm using Java
2011-11-20T01:45:48  <ficode> can anyone suggest a good way to test / attach to a mono process from monodevelop when loading from playgame.py ?
2011-11-20T01:45:55  <thestinger> well, my BFS is very specialized for this
2011-11-20T01:46:12  <thestinger> the only dynamic allocation I do is for the fifo queue (a std::queue)
2011-11-20T01:46:38  <thestinger> I store the distances in a 2d array (pre-allocated), and use that to avoid revisiting nodes

2011-11-20T01:47:27  <thestinger> it's less than a dozen lines of code, so it was pretty easy to get it very optimized
2011-11-20T01:47:56  <jab_bott> thestinger: yeah - it's tough in Java to not allocate stuff when you need it!
2011-11-20T01:48:07  <jab_bott> I might have to implement some re-use pools
2011-11-20T01:48:34  <thestinger> you can pass a 2d array by reference though, right?
2011-11-20T01:48:41  <thestinger> and just clear it and reuse it whenever you do a BFS
2011-11-20T01:48:52  <thestinger> and then use it for pathfinding/distances (that's what I'm doing atm)
2011-11-20T01:49:24  <jab_bott> well, I use a 1d array of boolean for explored tracking
2011-11-20T01:50:33  <jab_bott> I'm not really calculating distances - only subtracting 1 from the 'value' of each point whenever I go one step deeper in the BFS
2011-11-20T01:50:53  <jab_bott> which gives you the same thing I suppose
2011-11-20T01:51:49  <thestinger> ah
2011-11-20T01:51:59  <thestinger> I start off most things at '0' (as in, 0 distance from themselves :P)
2011-11-20T01:52:11  <thestinger> then +1 to the old value with each step of the BFS
2011-11-20T01:52:23  <thestinger> and I do +4 instead when going through an ant
2011-11-20T01:52:39  <thestinger> that last part doesn't work very well atm
2011-11-20T01:53:18  <thestinger> I think I just have a bug or two in my movement code because it used to work well
2011-11-20T01:53:56  <thestinger> I guess for the collaborative diffusion thing you start off with big numbers and diffuse them over the map
2011-11-20T01:54:04  <thestinger> I'm sort of doing the opposite
2011-11-20T01:54:20  <jab_bott> ahh, so your ants flow downwards then - it's the same thing though really, just mine flow 'up' trying to maximize the value, right?
2011-11-20T01:54:29  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-20T01:54:38  <thestinger> same thing, as long as your value is big enough that it covers the whole map
2011-11-20T01:55:13  <jab_bott> I'm not doing any 'diffusion' as far as I know - I think that means you run some kind of convolution on the grid
2011-11-20T01:55:48  <thestinger> I like doing it this way b/c I get distance measurements in addition to pathfinding (I guess you get something like that too though)
2011-11-20T01:56:14  <jab_bott> I wonder about that anyway - surely that diffusion method means it takes time for the values to spread and find your ants, rather than instant like with BFS?

2011-11-20T01:57:11  <jab_bott> I think your +4 for ants will only create a small shadow behind the ant - because won't the other values from round the sides swallow over it?
2011-11-20T01:57:40  <thestinger> yeah, it just makes them willing to go sideways rather than "following the leader"
2011-11-20T01:57:57  <thestinger> they will still occasionally follow the ant in front of them, just not always like they used to
2011-11-20T01:58:22  <thestinger> and if I get a big clog in a chokepoint, it will increase the distance of that path a lot
2011-11-20T01:58:26  <thestinger> so they'll take alternate routes

2011-11-20T01:58:40  <jab_bott> ahh ok - I thought it was so a slightly farther object would seem more appealing since the most appealing already has an ant between you and it
2011-11-20T01:59:28  <thestinger> yeah, that can happen too
2011-11-20T01:59:30  <jab_bott> but as soon as the ant steps out of the shadow it would start to go for the closest one again
2011-11-20T01:59:34  <thestinger> if I put multiple targets on the map
2011-11-20T01:59:46  <thestinger> I was just talking about a map with 1 target though (like 1 enemy hill)
2011-11-20T02:00:14  <thestinger> I do a separate BFS for every single food because doing them together didn't work well
2011-11-20T02:00:46  <jab_bott> I might port my Java into C, or Objective-C if it gets supported
2011-11-20T02:00:49  <thestinger> doing it from ~7000 targets on one 2d array takes ~1ms (which is what happens for exploration)
2011-11-20T02:01:37  <thestinger> it used to take ~40ms before I switched to multi-source BFS

2011-11-20T03:49:40  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: Do you have already some nfo about seed of your battle resolution? What is the biggest amount of ants in the battle you can handle in 500ms?

2011-11-20T03:50:12  <antimatroid1> atm it's partitioning ants up into sets that can affect each other from battle
2011-11-20T03:50:27  <antimatroid1> then it's doing a kind of minimax thing to pick moves for friendly ants in each partition
2011-11-20T03:50:45  <antimatroid1> the plan is to next do each partition incrementally so as to get it running under the time limit

2011-11-20T03:52:15  <UncleVasya> Yep, a set of ants that can affect each other - it's my definition of Battle type. It consist 2 lists: my_battle_ants and enemy_battle_ants.
2011-11-20T03:52:41  <antimatroid1> i already partition it up a bit
2011-11-20T03:52:46  <antimatroid1> but they could still be too large
2011-11-20T03:53:27  <UncleVasya> But when the amount of ants goes to 10+ I have no time for this even with prunning (or I have to tune up this).
2011-11-20T03:54:02  <UncleVasya> So I' thinking about the idea to split big battles into few small ones.
2011-11-20T03:55:37  <UncleVasya> Solving them will not be as accurate as solving a big one completely (because some affects do not count) but maybe it will be better with the time limit.

2011-11-20T04:00:03  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: Also since my moves do not affect enemy moves isn't it faster to build once a list of all possible enemy positions in current battle and after that apply them to my positions?
2011-11-20T04:00:36  <UncleVasya> Instead of generating enemy moves for every your move.
2011-11-20T04:00:51  <antimatroid1> UncleVasya: i do what i think you're saying
2011-11-20T04:01:44  <antimatroid1> generate moves for me and my oponents, then for each of my lot of moves implement those to a copy of the state, then for each of the enemies moves implement those to the partial state until i know i wouldn't want to play that move and continue searching through the moves
2011-11-20T04:02:13  <UncleVasya> ok, I misunderstood when you said minimax. I thought you're talking about recursion but you mean only the way you're solving positions
2011-11-20T04:02:36  <antimatroid1> it's the same as the recursion way i'm just not using recursion
2011-11-20T04:02:48  <UncleVasya> yep, the loop.
2011-11-20T04:02:50  <antimatroid1> someone once told me recursion is bad and it stuck
2011-11-20T04:04:10  <UncleVasya> heh, somewhen I even saw some humans were writing a lot of loops to avoid recursion :)
2011-11-20T04:04:48  <UncleVasya> Something like 3 or 4 inner loops.
2011-11-20T04:06:56  <antimatroid1> wouldn't surprise me if that was me aha
2011-11-20T04:08:29  <UncleVasya> 'until i know i wouldn't want to play that move'   So my 'if cur_pos_score <= best_pos_score' isn't something I must proud for, it's just a standart :(
2011-11-20T04:12:57  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: Do you still have a folder with your PW-bot sources?
2011-11-20T04:13:10  <antimatroid1> i do
2011-11-20T04:13:30  <UncleVasya> Not the only last version.
2011-11-20T04:13:39  <antimatroid1> all of them?
2011-11-20T04:13:41  <antimatroid1> it's a real mess aha
2011-11-20T04:14:34  <antimatroid1> i don't even know what's my final bot in there aha
2011-11-20T04:15:06  <UncleVasya> Maybe you remember I told you I wanna see how you was making it step by step.

2011-11-20T04:19:25  <antimatroid1> and i can't really be bothered going through and deleting compiled versions from folders
2011-11-20T04:19:36  <antimatroid1> i'll send you one of my finalish copies if you want?
2011-11-20T04:19:39  <UncleVasya> hmm, ok. I trust you :)
2011-11-20T04:21:35  <UncleVasya> I have a final version (from the forums).
2011-11-20T04:31:51  <speakeasy> hi
2011-11-20T04:32:19  <speakeasy> does the ai apply to the ants themselves or as a sort of god of ants?
2011-11-20T04:32:44  <speakeasy> thats a bit confusing sorry
2011-11-20T04:41:21  <Euphony> Real ants are already pretty smart, and they do have a sort of God (their queen), so yeah
2011-11-20T04:42:08  <speakeasy> but does the bot apply to the ants individualy or to the colony as a whole?
2011-11-20T04:42:12  <bqf> speakeasy: there is a "god" (your bot) that controls all ants and to whom all ants report what they see
2011-11-20T04:42:34  <speakeasy> aha, that makes things very clear thanks
2011-11-20T04:42:46  <UncleVasya> hi,One instance of your bot contrlos all the ants you have. So bot some kind of playing an RTS game.
2011-11-20T04:43:10  <speakeasy> also whats a treeset?
2011-11-20T04:43:16  <speakeasy> thanks uncle
2011-11-20T04:44:27  <Euphony> set means no duplicates. tree means sorted. yar
2011-11-20T04:45:05  <speakeasy> so whats the difference between a treeset and an arraylist?
2011-11-20T04:45:29  <speakeasy> sorry, i probs should have said im working in java

2011-11-20T04:47:42  <speakeasy> ok haha lol
2011-11-20T04:48:40  <antimatroid> i think one of the sample bots might suck time wise
2011-11-20T04:49:36  <speakeasy> i think i should probably learn some more java before trying this any more, im a little confused :s
2011-11-20T04:50:02  <antimatroid> yeah lefty bot has an issue
2011-11-20T04:50:40  <antimatroid> it'll eat up just under the entire turn limit on like turn 9 in this game i have :\
2011-11-20T04:50:49  <delt0r_> speakeasy: nothing wrong with learning on the job as they say...
2011-11-20T04:52:06  <speakeasy> is there any docs on things i can call, e.g. move ant x north or attack with ant y
2011-11-20T04:52:07  <speakeasy> ?
2011-11-20T04:52:08  <delt0r_> also java is a little more forgiving that some other "core" langs... where core here is defined as "used a lot in industry"
2011-11-20T04:52:21  <speakeasy> lol
2011-11-20T04:52:52  <delt0r_> speakeasy: the javadocs describe things a bit. Then wiki/google would help with the rest
2011-11-20T04:53:14  <speakeasy> where can i get a copy of the javadocs?
2011-11-20T04:53:14  <delt0r_> but the starter bot source is its documentation
2011-11-20T04:53:29  <delt0r_> you can download them --java api
2011-11-20T04:53:30  <speakeasy> ah ok
2011-11-20T04:54:07  <delt0r_> javadoc is a standard of commenting code... then you run a javadoc program that output a set of html pages that is now your api docs
2011-11-20T04:54:25  <delt0r_> the core java api docs are very good
2011-11-20T04:54:32  <delt0r_> python has something similar
2011-11-20T04:55:10  <delt0r_> but C++/C even tho has doxygen don't seem to use it for there own api
2011-11-20T04:55:12  <Euphony> I believe there are comments in the code for Ants.java and other important starter bot classes. The javadocs just use those comments before the function and class declarations.
2011-11-20T04:55:16  <speakeasy> ah ok
2011-11-20T04:55:32  <speakeasy> thanks for being so helpful guys
2011-11-20T04:56:14  <delt0r_> otherwise a tree set internally orders things in a balanced tree so most operations are ln(n)
2011-11-20T04:57:21  <delt0r_> speakeasy: one of the fetures of this comp is the "learning" or newb  coders can join and lean... so feel free to ask for help
2011-11-20T04:57:46  <delt0r_> but whatever you do DONT go into the ##java  channel
2011-11-20T04:58:10  <delt0r_> nothing but trolls
2011-11-20T04:58:37  <speakeasy> haha lol
2011-11-20T04:58:42  <speakeasy> will take note of that
2011-11-20T04:59:01  <delt0r_> you would get more help for java in a C# channel
2011-11-20T04:59:48  <speakeasy> haha
2011-11-20T05:00:07  <speakeasy> im reading through the tutorial section and trying to understand the code
2011-11-20T05:00:15  <speakeasy> erm there is a bit that says getAnts
2011-11-20T05:00:28  <speakeasy> however i cant find it in the ants.java file
2011-11-20T05:00:39  <speakeasy> whatsgoingon?
2011-11-20T05:00:47  <delt0r_> that is calling a method in another class
2011-11-20T05:01:03  <delt0r_> aka another file
2011-11-20T05:01:22  <speakeasy> which file?
2011-11-20T05:01:33  <delt0r_> don't remember
2011-11-20T05:01:36  <speakeasy> or should i just accept that it does what it says on the tin :L
2011-11-20T05:01:39  <delt0r_> if you use a IDE
2011-11-20T05:01:45  <delt0r_> it would find it for you
2011-11-20T05:01:50  <delt0r_> otherwise there is grep
2011-11-20T05:01:59  <delt0r_> I would recomend useing a ide
2011-11-20T05:02:03  <delt0r_> like eclipse
2011-11-20T05:02:06  <speakeasy> how do import all these files into netbeans?
2011-11-20T05:02:17  <delt0r_> don't use netbeans
2011-11-20T05:02:32  <delt0r_> but my guess there is a import under file
2011-11-20T05:02:45  <delt0r_> so you need to start a project with no files
2011-11-20T05:02:55  <speakeasy> ah, it just imports "project file" format
2011-11-20T05:02:57  <delt0r_> then import them... or just copy them,
2011-11-20T05:03:21  <delt0r_> eclipse uses ~/workspace/ under linux
2011-11-20T05:03:30  <delt0r_> don't know about netbeans
2011-11-20T05:04:05  <speakeasy> ah ok

2011-11-20T07:05:36  <pairofdice> :>
2011-11-20T07:05:49  <mcstar> i would never thought about this before
2011-11-20T07:05:52  <mcstar> i just tried ti
2011-11-20T07:06:07  <mcstar> i mean you antimatroid always said that
2011-11-20T07:06:12  <mcstar> but i didnt actually believe you
2011-11-20T07:06:37  <mcstar> i thought there must be something more going on
2011-11-20T07:07:17  <mcstar> im gonna combine this with my previous one
2011-11-20T07:07:17  <antimatroid> mcstar: i have a collectUnseen and collectNotRecentlySeen function
2011-11-20T07:07:45  <antimatroid> and it'll do bfs's from movable ants to find an appropriate square and move the ant on that path and "bomb" the vision information at its target
2011-11-20T07:07:52  <antimatroid> so it doesn't send lots of ants to the same patch

2011-11-20T07:10:26  <mcstar> but i might use it for something other than navigation

2011-11-20T07:10:58  <mcstar> i had a collection of nodes, that connect to many pixels of the original one, like 16
2011-11-20T07:11:10  <mcstar> and i can collect information from those cells
2011-11-20T07:11:16  <mcstar> and store that in the supercell
2011-11-20T07:11:27  <mcstar> so i can get a genral idea whats where

2011-11-20T07:11:58  <mcstar> i worked out a scheme that removes degeneracies in this supercell structure
2011-11-20T07:12:13  <mcstar> and rearranges the pixels
2011-11-20T07:12:22  <mcstar> anyway, this is great
2011-11-20T07:13:14  <HaraKiri> i still haven't found a good, fast and elegant solution to the exploring problem :/
2011-11-20T07:14:10  <mcstar> just try this one
2011-11-20T07:14:16  <mcstar> you will be pleased
2011-11-20T07:14:28  <HaraKiri> you mean what antimatroid said?

2011-11-20T07:15:10  <mcstar> not necessarily
2011-11-20T07:15:18  <mcstar> you can start with a simpler one
2011-11-20T07:15:35  <mcstar> like pairofdice said
2011-11-20T07:16:00  <HaraKiri> closest unseen tile leads to horrible behaiour
2011-11-20T07:16:20  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-20T07:16:24  <mcstar> noway
2011-11-20T07:16:28  <mcstar> its beautiful
2011-11-20T07:16:41  <mcstar> they behave like children with good manners
2011-11-20T07:16:50  <ikaros> when i tried that i had alot of jittering ants in many situations
2011-11-20T07:16:56  <HaraKiri> exactly
2011-11-20T07:17:00  <mcstar> no
2011-11-20T07:17:01  <HaraKiri> they oscillate between two places
2011-11-20T07:17:02  <pairofdice> I probably set the rate at which they recheck unseen tiles too fast
2011-11-20T07:17:03  <mcstar> thats soemthing else

2011-11-20T07:17:30  <HaraKiri> the closest never explored tile then?
2011-11-20T07:17:34  <mcstar> i pathfind till i find a tile that noone has seen before
2011-11-20T07:17:47  <HaraKiri> that is better, but then a lot of ants go to the same spot
2011-11-20T07:17:52  <mcstar> not really
2011-11-20T07:18:05  <pairofdice> There's ways around that
2011-11-20T07:18:10  <HaraKiri> well if 3 ants spawn in 3 rounds, then they will probably all go to the same target
2011-11-20T07:18:18  <mcstar> no
2011-11-20T07:18:30  <ikaros> HaraKiri, what you could try out is this: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=1776
2011-11-20T07:18:30  <mcstar> i dont preserve paths
2011-11-20T07:19:38  <ikaros> its a different approach to exploration.. but i found it to work very good. at least until you have explored the map or loops
2011-11-20T07:20:43  <ikaros> i altered it this way that if an ant leaves the positive "highway" it begins to stumble this works very good in combination
2011-11-20T07:21:22  <HaraKiri> i've seen this thread, and i'm generating highways too, but frankly the general idea wasn't clear to me, so i gave up reading halfway

2011-11-20T07:22:18  <ikaros> the idea is pretty simple
2011-11-20T07:22:31  <ikaros> an efficient implementation is a bit fiddling i think
2011-11-20T07:22:52  <ikaros> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.6351 wanderer is one of my experimentals .. it uses the linked strategy
2011-11-20T07:23:12  <ikaros> the bot isnt very good but im satisfied with the exploration so far
2011-11-20T07:23:37  <HaraKiri> hmm yes at least looks much better than any results i had
2011-11-20T07:24:51  <ikaros> what didnt you understand with the strategy?
2011-11-20T07:26:10  <ikaros> you use your hills as origins which are set to 0
2011-11-20T07:26:41  <ikaros> then update all visible values to the real distance to the origin (bfs or something)
2011-11-20T07:26:55  <HaraKiri> it's probably understandable of you read up what hill climbing is, i just didnt do that, and then the text makes little sense because it delves into details
2011-11-20T07:27:07  <HaraKiri> i know and do bfs's
2011-11-20T07:27:23  <ikaros> hill climbing in this context just means your ant always takes the greatest step

2011-11-20T07:27:44  <ikaros> it never goes to a tile with a smaller value than which it is sitting on
2011-11-20T07:28:03  <HaraKiri> well that's the general idea behind using bfs for pathfinding, right?
2011-11-20T07:28:16  <ikaros> the point is in detecting loops and dead ends.. and the very elegant idea of flipping signs then
2011-11-20T07:28:24  <ikaros> yea kinda
2011-11-20T07:28:41  <HaraKiri> detecting dead ends speeds up the whole thing, but has nothing to do with the exploration problem itself as i see it
2011-11-20T07:28:43  <ikaros> the difference is perhaps that you dont have real targets here
2011-11-20T07:29:12  <ikaros> oh it has. if your ants dont enter dead ends they explore the unknown faster
2011-11-20T07:29:19  <ikaros> same with loops
2011-11-20T07:30:13  <ikaros> on occasion you will want to enter loops or dead ends. you have to ignore that map then
2011-11-20T07:30:30  <ikaros> but for initial exploration the algorithm is very good. especially in mazes
2011-11-20T07:31:01  <HaraKiri> hmm maybe i'll look into it. but it "feels" forced and unnatural
2011-11-20T07:31:53  <pairofdice> Setting your hills as origins your ants try to get just sounds like a bad idea to me
2011-11-20T07:32:00  <pairofdice> get away from*
2011-11-20T07:32:31  <ikaros> why that
2011-11-20T07:32:52  <HaraKiri> i can see how not exploring dead ants can help, but that's really just a tiny optimazion. i'm still optimistic that there is a simple and elegant algorithm to the general problem
2011-11-20T07:33:03  <HaraKiri> dead ants = dead ends lol :D
2011-11-20T07:33:17  <ikaros> well in fact you "explore" them.. you must see it
2011-11-20T07:33:25  <ikaros> you just dont go in a second time
2011-11-20T07:33:31  <ikaros> and leave them the fastest way

2011-11-20T08:21:07  <willem> How is this possible?
2011-11-20T08:25:00  <willem> nvm I solved the problem.

2011-11-20T08:59:09  <antimatroid> is it 5 seconds on tcp?
2011-11-20T08:59:19  <antimatroid> does it give the bots a smaller one then cushion it?
2011-11-20T08:59:28  <antimatroid> or expect you to cushion it yourself for network overhead?
2011-11-20T08:59:47  <antimatroid> it used to just tells bots the normal one i think then add like 4 seconds
2011-11-20T09:00:12  <mcstar> i think i remember seein 5000ms when i debugged
2011-11-20T09:00:28  <antimatroid> my bot will be trying to use near 5000ms then :P

2011-11-20T09:56:31  <a1k0n> (set my bot for 500ms max)
2011-11-20T09:56:34  <mcstar> k
2011-11-20T09:56:42  <a1k0n> versions of my bot?  i tag them in git
2011-11-20T09:56:46  <mcstar> my editor(kdevelop) uses sessions
2011-11-20T09:57:07  <mcstar> and if i copy a version to another directory i have to make a new session for it
2011-11-20T09:57:15  <a1k0n> i just discovered i completely broke my bot sometime a couple days ago
2011-11-20T09:57:16  <mcstar> i like emacs's desktop-load much better
2011-11-20T09:57:23  <a1k0n> but it still works pretty well
2011-11-20T09:57:34  <mcstar> completely?
2011-11-20T09:57:48  <a1k0n> i'm not even sure wtf is wrong, the output just looks wrong
2011-11-20T09:58:07  <mcstar> is your bot that long?
2011-11-20T09:58:17  <mcstar> i think i can still keep it in mind
2011-11-20T09:58:21  <mcstar> mine
2011-11-20T09:59:27  <mcstar> however im not satisfied with their level of inteligence
2011-11-20T09:59:37  <mcstar> im gonna try to make use of my ant class
2011-11-20T09:59:56  <mcstar> make them more autonomus
2011-11-20T10:02:18  <pairofdice> Watch out for ant revolt
2011-11-20T10:03:27  <mcstar> oh, they will rebel against their god?
2011-11-20T10:03:54  <mcstar> i have ^c the ultimate weapon

2011-11-20T10:57:18  <Fluxid> how can i run locally my 5 versions of bots in many games, randomly, with random maps, and get ranking at the end?
2011-11-20T11:02:21  <a1k0n> i was contemplating the same
2011-11-20T11:04:14  <Yexo> set up a local tcp server and connect with all 5 bots?
2011-11-20T11:05:14  <a1k0n> too cpu intensive for my lappy
2011-11-20T11:06:23  <Yexo> modify the server to run all clients one by one instead of simultaniously?
2011-11-20T11:06:38  <mcstar> scripting...
2011-11-20T11:06:48  <Fluxid> Yexo: duh, option with local tcp is not bad
2011-11-20T11:10:53  <bqf> Fluxid: you are probably aware of this, i'll say it anyway: ranking your bot against other versions of itself could lead to some pretty heavy bias. you're far from guaranteed to actually find the "best" bot (as in: the one that would do best on the official server) this way.
2011-11-20T11:11:28  <pairofdice> Yeah, you would need some other bots in the mix
2011-11-20T11:11:59  <pairofdice> But you are already running the tcp server, soo...
2011-11-20T11:14:42  <Fluxid> bqf: i want to see how small changes in my bot change its behaviour in different situations. just running it locally manually via playgame.py is tiring

2011-11-20T15:29:07  <Anilm3> Would manhattan distance work well on Astar?
2011-11-20T15:29:25  <thestinger> as the heuristic? yes, just make sure to wrap it properly
2011-11-20T15:29:47  <thestinger> pathfinding for each ant to their target will probably be much too slow though
2011-11-20T15:30:22  <Anilm3> I have a working version that works quite fast but I just wanted to know if manhattan was ok
2011-11-20T15:31:09  <thestinger> you just can't overestimate the distance in the heuristic if you want the shortest path
2011-11-20T15:31:38  <Anilm3> I'll have to see if it's wrapped properly

2011-11-20T16:12:47  <besh> really. I struggled a lot on how to do it. That is the best I can come up with :)
2011-11-20T16:13:17  <thestinger> yeah, that seems to work really well
2011-11-20T16:13:18  <okan_> good idea but they are defenceless i guess

2011-11-20T16:15:05  <thestinger> I think I've finally fixed the bugs in my defense branch
2011-11-20T16:15:25  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.7836
2011-11-20T16:15:35  <okan_> maybe sort your ants just like groups for example 4 of them stay together :P
2011-11-20T16:16:01  <thestinger> strcat_homeland has my new defense code, and it seems to work a lot better than my complete lack of defense before
2011-11-20T16:16:26  <thestinger> my other attempts at defense actually kept ants near my hill so my bot wasn't as good at foraging/exploration
2011-11-20T16:22:28  <Conorach> thestinger, I've been wondering if it would be better to prevent enemy ants from even finding your hill in the first place.
2011-11-20T16:22:34  <Conorach> even if it means suiciding one ant.
2011-11-20T16:22:49  <Conorach> most people will have some offensive code to attack enemy hills in force.
2011-11-20T16:22:54  <Yexo> Conorach: that might be very hard in maze maps
2011-11-20T16:23:22  <thestinger> Conorach: yeah, once the hill is found it's usually screwed
2011-11-20T16:24:00  <besh> Enemies explore so they will eventually find your hill.
2011-11-20T16:24:10  <thestinger> this code relies on a constant supply of new ants for defense (if I'm losing at foraging defense isn't going to help) and just tries to keep away the enemy as long as possible
2011-11-20T16:24:12  <Conorach> but in that fight it's amazing how you keep them out for a lon time :)
2011-11-20T16:24:13  <thestinger> so I can keep getting new ants
2011-11-20T16:25:26  <Conorach> besh, but it's different if they find your hill right? they will send their ants to attack it. Of course when there is only one place in the map unexplored, they will come in force as well, but that's usually a lot better than around the 15 ant mark, when two enemies see your hill and go all-in ;)
2011-11-20T16:25:27  <Conorach> hehe
2011-11-20T16:27:03  <besh> I always try to keep twice the number of enemy ants around each of my hills.
2011-11-20T16:27:38  <besh> It works most of the time unless some crazy bot sends all of its ants before I have time to regroup.
2011-11-20T16:27:55  <thestinger> that's pretty much what my defense does now
2011-11-20T16:28:39  <besh> Also always keep one ant close to your hill just to have vision.
2011-11-20T16:29:00  <thestinger> yeah, I need to do that

2011-11-20T16:31:03  <thestinger> you don't have to do it in the very early game though
2011-11-20T16:31:33  <besh> yes, it is good also in those maps where hills are placed close to one another.
2011-11-20T16:32:11  <thestinger> yeah, the game specification has a rule about minimum hill distance for map generation but the current maps don't seem the follow it
2011-11-20T16:32:20  <thestinger> "Hills must be between 100 and 250 steps away from other hills (details still being worked on)"
2011-11-20T16:33:44  <besh> I think those maps need to go for the final games
2011-11-20T16:33:54  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/specification.php#map_generators
2011-11-20T16:33:59  <thestinger> yeah, that makes sense
2011-11-20T16:34:28  <thestinger> the maps with hills really close together are way too random/luck-based imo - if 1 or 2 of the bots next to you go in your direction right away, you're screwed
2011-11-20T16:34:31  <iglo> for testing the bot in starterpackage in c++ with play_one_game_live.sh  ; is it correct to load it with "cpp mybotfolder/mybot.cc" ?
2011-11-20T16:34:37  <thestinger> maybe you can fend them off, and then you're both screwed
2011-11-20T16:35:20  <besh> yes, especially with multip-player games.
2011-11-20T16:35:23  <g0llum> iglo, no, first compile that, the run the executable with playgame.py
2011-11-20T16:35:46  <besh> I mean if it was just 2 you would probably give the same damage as you recieve.
2011-11-20T16:36:08  <iglo> ok

2011-11-20T17:07:31  <Yexo> so debug your own bot to see why it crashed
2011-11-20T17:07:38  <Yexo> that's got nothing to do with playgame.py perse

2011-11-20T17:43:22  <rajanaresh> hi all. I wanted to ask if A* is a good way to collect food if an ant sees one, considering I have all the knowledge of the environment. Is it going to timeout in certain cases?
2011-11-20T17:43:54  <amstan> rajanaresh: i've heard a lot of people saying it's slow
2011-11-20T17:44:01  <avdg> A* is good if you care about 1 or a few target only (since its good in concentrating its extension in 1 direction)
2011-11-20T17:44:16  <amstan> rajanaresh: collaborative diffusion seems like a pupular idea
2011-11-20T17:44:17  <avdg> if you want more, you probably want bfs
2011-11-20T17:44:23  <amstan> see forums
2011-11-20T17:45:24  <delt0r_> amstan: collaborative diffusion didn't work so well for me
2011-11-20T17:45:29  <amstan> aww
2011-11-20T17:45:32  <amstan> ok, bfs then
2011-11-20T17:46:03  <Yexo> collaborative diffusion works pretty well
2011-11-20T17:46:05  <delt0r_> its fine for finding food moving around... but you still end up with a mess when you want to add any real strategy
2011-11-20T17:46:23  <Yexo> of course not for the actual fights
2011-11-20T17:46:26  <rajanaresh> I don't understand how can bfs be any faster than uniform cost search or A*
2011-11-20T17:46:28  <delt0r_> not just that
2011-11-20T17:47:02  <Yexo> rajanaresh: A* is fast if you go from one (or a few) source to a single target
2011-11-20T17:47:16  <delt0r_> its things like sticking around to defend for example... sometimes enemy ants should attract other times they need to repeal etc
2011-11-20T17:47:56  <Yexo> so change the evaluation function depending on location / turn / etc.
2011-11-20T17:48:11  <delt0r_> in which case its not longer really the right tool
2011-11-20T17:48:23  <delt0r_> since your hacking in more than it does...
2011-11-20T17:49:26  <Yexo> so what would be the right tool there?

2011-11-20T18:50:20  <bugnuts> it uses the file extension to decide language and then just compiles all the code it finds

2011-11-20T18:51:41  <devrand> I guess it makes sense... actually really shocked they didn't use the march flag
2011-11-20T18:53:25  <bugnuts> well I think the idea is to be conservative and break the fewest things.
2011-11-20T18:53:50  <devrand> yeah... I don't know if I should bring up the loops (as well as -03 actually)
2011-11-20T18:53:51  <bugnuts> although I guess -O3 and is not that really
2011-11-20T18:54:04  <devrand> gcc documentation recommends not using it, loll
2011-11-20T18:54:21  <devrand> actually the unroll loops thing too
2011-11-20T18:54:29  <bugnuts> well thankfully the compiler for my language has no optimisation
2011-11-20T18:54:33  <devrand> it cuts my (local) performance almost in half on a subroutine
2011-11-20T18:54:52  <bugnuts> can you disable it with a pragma or something
2011-11-20T18:55:05  <devrand> hmm... maybe
2011-11-20T18:55:14  <devrand> not sure where priority would go... worth taking a look into

2011-11-20T18:55:47  <devrand> awesome
2011-11-20T18:55:57  <devrand> thought about that, but it seemed the whole point of go was multi-threading

2011-11-20T18:56:21  <devrand> well.. .tying a hand behind your back - wrong expression
2011-11-20T18:56:21  <bugnuts> It just really pleasant to work in.
2011-11-20T18:56:47  <devrand> eh - that's good I guess
2011-11-20T18:58:01  <devrand> only toyed with it myself
2011-11-20T18:58:01  <bugnuts> and seems to be plenty fast enough.  I did have to look at the emitted assembly code a few times for inner loop things
2011-11-20T18:58:01  <devrand> seems more pleasant than C, but not as familiar with it either
2011-11-20T18:58:01  <devrand> lol - way too much work on an x86 arch to do that
2011-11-20T19:00:18  <devrand> damn - compiler options specified on the command line can override compiler options used in #pragma options
2011-11-20T19:01:20  <amstan> devrand: why do you need march?
2011-11-20T19:01:35  <devrand> don't need march... just want to get rid of funroll loops really

2011-11-20T19:05:37  <bugnuts> actually you might get it to not unroll loops with a limit declared volatile
2011-11-20T19:06:22  <devrand> maybe... but with -03 all bets are probably off anyway
2011-11-20T19:06:41  <devrand> will compiler respect a volatile then?
2011-11-20T19:06:48  <bugnuts> I expect it will.
2011-11-20T19:07:03  <ChrisH_> @later tell janzert game #110490 and #110491 were exact duplicates
2011-11-20T19:07:03  <contestbot> ChrisH_: OK
2011-11-20T19:07:03  <bugnuts> its pretty important for hardware stuff
2011-11-20T19:09:19  <devrand> helps, but still about 175% running time compared to not having funroll loops at all
2011-11-20T19:09:28  <devrand> better than the 210% ish
2011-11-20T19:10:11  <devrand> bleh, thanks for the help... I'll be afkish.  Hate compilers
2011-11-20T19:10:17  <bugnuts> ChrisH_ not exactly the same - the player seed was not the same .

2011-11-20T19:10:45  <devrand> btw ChrisH they covered that before... supposedly some small percent of games are duplicates
2011-11-20T19:10:52  <ChrisH_> bugnuts: no, but the scheduler isn't supposed to pick the same two players on the same map in consecutive games.
2011-11-20T19:11:08  <devrand> an error that's too hard to debug.. happens due to concurrency issues (multiple servers)
2011-11-20T19:11:10  <bugnuts> fair enough.
2011-11-20T19:11:17  <ChrisH_> devrand: yes, I am aware of that as well, but thought they would want to know when it happens
2011-11-20T19:11:32  <devrand> kk
2011-11-20T19:12:23  <ChrisH_> thanks for the comments though, both of you, it's good that others help when the admins aren't online.  :)
