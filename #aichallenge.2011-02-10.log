2011-02-10T00:17:28  <antimatroid> bleh, i hate [x][y]
2011-02-10T00:17:57  <antimatroid> say you have a map in file:
2011-02-10T00:17:57  <antimatroid> aaa
2011-02-10T00:17:57  <antimatroid> bbb
2011-02-10T00:17:57  <antimatroid> does that then get passed as
2011-02-10T00:17:57  <antimatroid> ab
2011-02-10T00:17:57  <antimatroid> ab
2011-02-10T00:17:57  <antimatroid> ab?
2011-02-10T00:28:02  <antimatroid> err, it doesn't get passed :P
2011-02-10T00:28:12  <antimatroid> i still hate [x][y]
2011-02-10T00:38:19  <sigh> antimatroid: you seem quite obsessed about this
2011-02-10T00:46:02  <antimatroid> sigh: it makes my life harder
2011-02-10T00:46:22  <sigh> I'm sure it does
2011-02-10T00:46:24  <antimatroid> i don't see how anyone prefers that
2011-02-10T00:47:10  <janzert> somehow 40+ years of programmers have managed
2011-02-10T00:48:02  <antimatroid> janzert: they've all been wrong :P
2011-02-10T00:48:20  <antimatroid> it's like having current around the wrong way
2011-02-10T00:49:55  <jmcarthur> 40+ years of imperative programming is wrong, too
2011-02-10T00:49:59  <jmcarthur> and so are people that use vim
2011-02-10T00:50:14  <jmcarthur> and god don't get me started on tabs and spaces
2011-02-10T00:51:38  <sigh> yay, everyone is wrong
2011-02-10T00:52:31  <antimatroid> no, not i
2011-02-10T00:52:43  <jmcarthur> self is never wrong
2011-02-10T00:52:56  <antimatroid> if i'm wrong, the universe is accomodate
2011-02-10T00:53:00  <antimatroid> is to*

2011-02-10T01:29:02  <antimatroid> McLeopold: he went to bed
2011-02-10T01:29:13  <antimatroid> i'm working on changing to your input atm
2011-02-10T01:29:28  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I added "G" and "F noPlayer..." lines for input
2011-02-10T01:29:34  <antimatroid> to etherpad
2011-02-10T01:29:39  <McLeopold> etherpad? can you link me?
2011-02-10T01:29:44  <McLeopold> I'm on a different machine
2011-02-10T01:29:50  <antimatroid> http://ietherpad.com/TR0zbEqvx1
2011-02-10T01:30:22  <antimatroid> i think we're closer to convincing jeff that 1 might be better to use for attacks
2011-02-10T01:30:33  <antimatroid> thanks to prillicy
2011-02-10T01:30:59  <McLeopold> whatever, it's a function swap in the engine
2011-02-10T01:31:19  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-10T01:31:41  <antimatroid> with bot output, are you happy with W for a move?
2011-02-10T01:31:50  <McLeopold> if we go with option 1, I'm going to have to put in *effort* to win
2011-02-10T01:31:53  <antimatroid> it's used for wall with input, but M is used with map syntax?
2011-02-10T01:32:21  <McLeopold> i'd rather have it m
2011-02-10T01:32:28  <antimatroid> done
2011-02-10T01:32:31  <McLeopold> map syntax can be just the ascii art
2011-02-10T01:32:43  <McLeopold> take out the P and M on maps
2011-02-10T01:32:54  <McLeopold> the engine can count
2011-02-10T01:32:54  <antimatroid> easy
2011-02-10T01:33:12  <McLeopold> same with number of players, it will just record what it finds
2011-02-10T01:33:24  <antimatroid> are you translating the map when you read it in?
2011-02-10T01:33:32  <antimatroid> or are you treating each row as though those are a col?
2011-02-10T01:33:45  <antimatroid> not translating, transposing
2011-02-10T01:33:47  <McLeopold> a row is a row, or a line on the x axis
2011-02-10T01:33:51  <McLeopold> so, I'm translating
2011-02-10T01:34:11  <antimatroid> okay, i've done my conversions right
2011-02-10T01:34:17  <McLeopold> the engine stores stuff as row/col
2011-02-10T01:34:21  <antimatroid> i still think it just complicates things, but i'll survive :P
2011-02-10T01:34:45  <McLeopold> jeff's comment on bots being x/y was "whatever"
2011-02-10T01:34:51  <McLeopold> so we could go all row/col
2011-02-10T01:35:19  <antimatroid> it means nobody ever needs to bother transposing and worrying about whether they should or not, but really you can abstract it out when you handle the input
2011-02-10T01:35:22  <antimatroid> then never think about it again
2011-02-10T01:35:29  <antimatroid> so yeah, whatever from me too
2011-02-10T01:36:10  <antimatroid> it could confuse the hell out of beginners, more so than understand the concept of indexing by row,col
2011-02-10T01:36:18  <janzert> everything is axis agnostic though right? so if people get the axis backwards except for visualization right
2011-02-10T01:36:28  <antimatroid> janzert: that can suck for debugging
2011-02-10T01:36:51  <janzert> ...for visualization it won't matter
2011-02-10T01:36:54  <McLeopold> janzert: not really, moves are n,e,w,s
2011-02-10T01:37:17  <McLeopold> if someone got it wrong, north would go east
2011-02-10T01:37:18  <janzert> hmm, so it does matter then
2011-02-10T01:37:19  <antimatroid> hehe, i like the news part
2011-02-10T01:38:14  <janzert> oh well it matters in a spot that they should figure it out very quickly if they get it wrong anyway
2011-02-10T01:38:22  <McLeopold> yea
2011-02-10T01:39:09  <McLeopold> antimatroid: 'go' is still the signal to process
2011-02-10T01:39:13  <McLeopold> not 'G'
2011-02-10T01:39:24  <McLeopold> and turn 0, the engine sends 'ready'
2011-02-10T01:40:50  <antimatroid> McLeopold: wouldn't it make sense for the bot to say it's ready to start?
2011-02-10T01:40:56  <antimatroid> why not just make them all G?
2011-02-10T01:41:03  <antimatroid> it's a single sharacter and easy to work with
2011-02-10T01:41:13  <McLeopold> it makes the starter bot look nice
2011-02-10T01:41:35  <antimatroid> okay, hang on, watch ether pad
2011-02-10T01:41:53  <McLeopold> it's very clear that 'ready' is for setup and 'go' is for order
2011-02-10T01:43:01  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I use cin >> charVar to work out what line type something is
2011-02-10T01:43:02  <McLeopold> oh, yeah, we do need a 'finish'
2011-02-10T01:43:10  <antimatroid> it's more expensive to do it to a string :P
2011-02-10T01:43:28  <antimatroid> i added it there with E ?
2011-02-10T01:43:39  <antimatroid> feel free to change any of that
2011-02-10T01:43:48  <janzert> that's a reason to make less of them single letters ;) so that people don't do that and have problems when we add other types that make even less sense as a single letter
2011-02-10T01:43:48  <antimatroid> i am just trying to make sure we have what's needed
2011-02-10T01:44:49  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I think sending ants land informtation is unecessary?
2011-02-10T01:44:58  <antimatroid> if all ants assume every square is land to start with
2011-02-10T01:45:06  <antimatroid> which you would
2011-02-10T01:45:06  <McLeopold> no, I don't want confusion on what is seen and what is not
2011-02-10T01:45:24  <antimatroid> but you don't send them land for what is currently seen every turn
2011-02-10T01:45:29  <antimatroid> we now have to work that out ourselves
2011-02-10T01:45:30  <McLeopold> then we don't need to make them program for view radius
2011-02-10T01:45:50  <antimatroid> or do you mean only sent once per turn?
2011-02-10T01:45:57  <McLeopold> land and walls are sent once
2011-02-10T01:46:02  <antimatroid> per turn or game?
2011-02-10T01:46:05  <McLeopold> it can be assumed that food and ants are on land
2011-02-10T01:46:10  <McLeopold> once per game
2011-02-10T01:46:14  <McLeopold> for an x,y pair
2011-02-10T01:47:10  <McLeopold> for the 'end' line, i don't think we need to send number of players
2011-02-10T01:47:15  <McLeopold> just the list of scores
2011-02-10T01:47:35  <McLeopold> but, whoever we send it to, their score needs to be first
2011-02-10T01:47:41  <antimatroid> oh wait, i see why it's needed
2011-02-10T01:47:45  <McLeopold> maybe we could send a rank only?
2011-02-10T01:47:46  <antimatroid> it's redundent for what i'll do
2011-02-10T01:47:49  <antimatroid> don't worry
2011-02-10T01:47:57  <McLeopold> end 1st 4players?
2011-02-10T01:48:17  <janzert> why are you giving the bot end of game information?
2011-02-10T01:48:24  <McLeopold> because we are nice
2011-02-10T01:48:29  <antimatroid> janzert: if people want to train it might be easier?
2011-02-10T01:48:36  <McLeopold> waiting for an EOFError is stupid
2011-02-10T01:48:37  <janzert> but officially we tell them they can't store it anyway
2011-02-10T01:48:41  <antimatroid> you can write to file at the end etc.
2011-02-10T01:48:47  <antimatroid> no, but they can train a bot locally
2011-02-10T01:48:55  <McLeopold> store what?
2011-02-10T01:49:03  <janzert> anything :)
2011-02-10T01:49:03  <antimatroid> can't write to file on servers
2011-02-10T01:49:29  <antimatroid> are we allowed to retrieve info from files?
2011-02-10T01:49:33  <antimatroid> i think that could be useful in this
2011-02-10T01:49:40  <janzert> it's going to lead to more bots that do writes though, make them do it outside of the bot even locally
2011-02-10T01:49:49  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-02-10T01:50:01  <janzert> antimatroid: yes, reading from data files uploaded along with the source code is fine
2011-02-10T01:50:05  <antimatroid> janzert: so you rekon don't send the end info?
2011-02-10T01:50:25  <antimatroid> janzert: will the .txt file end up where the compiled code is run though?
2011-02-10T01:50:30  <janzert> I think it just encourages unwanted behavior
2011-02-10T01:50:31  <McLeopold> janzert is going to kill your process before you can make sense of it
2011-02-10T01:50:39  <janzert> antimatroid: yes it would
2011-02-10T01:51:05  <McLeopold> janzert: maybe not send it to bots, it it will be part of the playback
2011-02-10T01:51:17  <janzert> whatever the directory state is after compilation ends up with your bot when it runs
2011-02-10T01:51:20  <McLeopold> I'll like the playback to be the exact same format as what is send to bots
2011-02-10T01:51:41  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you happy for me to remove all the end stuff?
2011-02-10T01:51:46  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-10T01:51:48  <janzert> McLeopold: I do too, but with fog of war it becomes pretty messy
2011-02-10T01:52:22  <McLeopold> the playback will be from a 3 party perspective
2011-02-10T01:52:26  <McLeopold> but will have the same format
2011-02-10T01:52:50  <McLeopold> are you concerned about storage space?
2011-02-10T01:53:01  <McLeopold> or bandwidth for viewing matches?
2011-02-10T01:53:13  <janzert> that'd be fine but for me loses the big advantage of using the same format that tron had, which was being able to feed replay data directly to the bot
2011-02-10T01:53:15  <antimatroid> janzert: i was thinking before, i don't think it works to treat them as "the enemy"
2011-02-10T01:53:37  <antimatroid> even keeping them separate for resolving states, doing that, their payoff is going to be geared somewhat towards cooperating against you i think
2011-02-10T01:53:48  <McLeopold> planetwars was crazy with it's 3 different formats
2011-02-10T01:53:49  <antimatroid> you want to consider cooperating with other people or free for all etc.
2011-02-10T01:54:25  <janzert> antimatroid: hmm? not sure what conversation you're referring to
2011-02-10T01:54:51  <janzert> yes, in an actual bot and with combat resolution that makes sense for sure you do :)
2011-02-10T01:54:53  <antimatroid> janzert: treating your opponents as "the enemy"
2011-02-10T01:54:57  <antimatroid> i think you made a comment about that earlier?
2011-02-10T01:55:29  <janzert> I think I might have but I meant it only in the very limited scenario jeff was proposing at the time
2011-02-10T01:55:44  <antimatroid> yeah sure
2011-02-10T01:56:38  <antimatroid> i think option 1 encourages cooperation more than 2 as well?
2011-02-10T01:56:38  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah, I didn't really like the radically different way planetwars formatted data
2011-02-10T01:56:56  <janzert> err, didn't really -> really didn't
2011-02-10T01:56:57  <antimatroid> wouldn't that be a good thing considering we're going with n-player?
2011-02-10T01:57:14  <janzert> maybe
2011-02-10T01:57:33  <janzert> I'm pretty strongly in favor of option 1 now that I thought about option 2 some more
2011-02-10T01:58:00  <McLeopold> can you summarize which option is which?
2011-02-10T01:58:02  <janzert> but I now also think 2 will be so bad that once it's up and running it will be fairly obvious it needs to change
2011-02-10T01:58:19  <janzert> 2 is the one jeff wants
2011-02-10T01:58:24  <antimatroid> McLeopold: 1 is jmcarthurs rule about number of enemies in fighting region
2011-02-10T01:58:36  <antimatroid> 2 is jeffs with remove closest fighting ants first
2011-02-10T01:58:36  <McLeopold> how will 2 be bad?
2011-02-10T01:59:00  <antimatroid> it encourages keeping your ants spread out
2011-02-10T01:59:08  <antimatroid> which is also the case for making sure you get growth
2011-02-10T01:59:15  <antimatroid> whereas 1 encourages roaming in packs
2011-02-10T01:59:16  <McLeopold> I want to hear it from janzert
2011-02-10T01:59:22  <janzert> it provides no incentive to clump
2011-02-10T01:59:35  <McLeopold> why is spreading out bad?
2011-02-10T01:59:35  <janzert> and we already have incentive to spread
2011-02-10T01:59:55  <janzert> it's not in itself but there needs to be a disadvantage from it as well
2011-02-10T02:00:02  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it means there is a balance, similar to don't expand too fast or slow
2011-02-10T02:00:04  <janzert> otherwise optimal strategy is always spread
2011-02-10T02:00:25  <McLeopold> well, damn, check the irc logs and you can see I've been saying that over and over
2011-02-10T02:00:37  <McLeopold> search for ying/yang
2011-02-10T02:00:40  <janzert> yeah, I think lots of people have :)
2011-02-10T02:01:05  <McLeopold> that's why I wanted hills
2011-02-10T02:01:16  <McLeopold> I thought it would provide incentive to clump
2011-02-10T02:01:22  <antimatroid> McLeopold: also situations like a.b.a make more sense with option 1
2011-02-10T02:01:48  <janzert> even with hills I don't think it would provide enough to bother clumping with option 2 for fighting
2011-02-10T02:02:05  <janzert> you would have to make sure you spread out evenly from the hill I guess
2011-02-10T02:02:07  <McLeopold> if we designed them correctly it would
2011-02-10T02:02:25  <antimatroid> i think this game currently meets my standards for an ideal game, the rules are so simple anyone can understand them, the game is easy for beginners to improve, and the pathway to the top is long and reasonably clear while complicated enough that bots wont be too similar
2011-02-10T02:02:50  <antimatroid> i do think it makes it even simpler if enemy ants just can't land in the same square, but not a huge amount
2011-02-10T02:03:00  <antimatroid> particularly when you want to handle information about dead ants
2011-02-10T02:03:13  <McLeopold> so, food encourages spread, combat encourages spread, scoring encourages spread
2011-02-10T02:03:46  <antimatroid> with 1 combat encourages both spreading and clumping
2011-02-10T02:03:51  <McLeopold> antimatroid: ants landing on the same square is no big deal either way, I've already programmed for that.
2011-02-10T02:04:09  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it's also more work for contestants if the want to handle the dead ant info
2011-02-10T02:04:18  <McLeopold> a defense line isn't always clumping
2011-02-10T02:04:19  <antimatroid> because they need to be able to handle multiple ants per square
2011-02-10T02:04:43  <antimatroid> yeah, option 1 offers a variety of optimal ways to do things, both for defense and offense, i really like that
2011-02-10T02:05:57  <antimatroid> McLeopold: with blocking off corridors, assuming you can fight through cracks, it's not very often that I think it will be possible
2011-02-10T02:06:27  <antimatroid> you could even enforce no
2011-02-10T02:06:27  <antimatroid> %%
2011-02-10T02:06:27  <antimatroid> %. patterns and i think it'd be impossible to block
2011-02-10T02:06:34  <McLeopold> maybe if there was a disadvantage to eating food
2011-02-10T02:06:51  <McLeopold> in PlanetWars, you had to "invest" in planets
2011-02-10T02:07:07  <McLeopold> ants would be like planet wars with 0 ship neutrals

2011-02-10T02:08:27  <McLeopold> I hate to say this, but the best way to counter spreading is to make the ant bring the food back to the hill
2011-02-10T02:08:40  <McLeopold> janzert: ^^
2011-02-10T02:08:49  <antimatroid> back to my game without hp? :P
2011-02-10T02:08:54  <McLeopold> yea
2011-02-10T02:09:14  <antimatroid> i'd still like option 1 battles :P
2011-02-10T02:09:39  <janzert> :) I certainly was never opposed to that
2011-02-10T02:09:51  <janzert> I think you'll never get jeff to agree though
2011-02-10T02:10:00  <McLeopold> "too complicated"
2011-02-10T02:10:03  <janzert> talking him out of option 2 has been about impossible
2011-02-10T02:10:10  <antimatroid> it's really easy to do a stupid path home algorithm
2011-02-10T02:10:17  <McLeopold> the battle system isn't going to fix the spread fast issue
2011-02-10T02:10:27  <McLeopold> if food is turned into ants on the spot
2011-02-10T02:10:32  <antimatroid> option 1 will make you go around in small packs
2011-02-10T02:10:42  <janzert> spreading fast isn't really a problem
2011-02-10T02:10:53  <janzert> the problem is that there isn't anything better than just spreading evenly
2011-02-10T02:11:18  <janzert> for sure at least not much better, and possibly not at all
2011-02-10T02:11:53  <McLeopold> if hills were the scoring, you could march an army in and hold a hill against a spread opponent
2011-02-10T02:12:28  <janzert> nope
2011-02-10T02:12:34  <janzert> an army does you no good
2011-02-10T02:12:59  <McLeopold> how so?
2011-02-10T02:13:07  <janzert> cause each ant you kill of mine I kill of yours and I can stream in replacements and my growth is higher than yours
2011-02-10T02:13:24  <janzert> and if your really bad I can kill multiple of yours for one of mine
2011-02-10T02:13:44  <janzert> that's the problem a clump never helps
2011-02-10T02:14:10  <McLeopold> well, then food is removed from the map, and new ants can only be created at the hill
2011-02-10T02:14:28  <janzert> might help
2011-02-10T02:14:34  <McLeopold> so an army that marches in and takes a hill can get reinforcements to where they need
2011-02-10T02:14:34  <antimatroid> that doesn't really encourage clumped fights
2011-02-10T02:14:42  <janzert> but why not just change the fight system, it's a lot easier
2011-02-10T02:14:44  <antimatroid> except there
2011-02-10T02:14:48  <janzert> and the true root of the problem
2011-02-10T02:14:50  <McLeopold> I'm not trying to encourage clumped fights
2011-02-10T02:15:02  <antimatroid> clumped fights are more interesting
2011-02-10T02:15:02  <McLeopold> I'm just trying to provide a weakness for a spread out player
2011-02-10T02:15:05  <janzert> you can't march in with an army though
2011-02-10T02:15:13  <janzert> unless you already out number me
2011-02-10T02:15:20  <McLeopold> not if your spread
2011-02-10T02:15:33  <McLeopold> it depends on how spread you are
2011-02-10T02:16:03  <antimatroid> if we did that, i'd just make sure ants are spread around the base such that they can take out incoming attacks and run back to give a stream to oncoming attacks from another direction
2011-02-10T02:16:11  <antimatroid> you're still going to spread out from the battle resolution
2011-02-10T02:16:58  <McLeopold> if you "take out" an incoming attack, your ant is dead
2011-02-10T02:17:06  <antimatroid> you never want more than one ant involved in the same fight, and if possible you want other people to fight over you
2011-02-10T02:17:10  <janzert> right, the perfect density is somewhere right around, probably slightly farther apart than, food spawn distance
2011-02-10T02:17:24  <antimatroid> whereas option 1 encourages getting everyone in there for a go and cooperating with other players to snipe ants in the middle
2011-02-10T02:17:41  <antimatroid> McLeopold: any ant is a walking kamakazee
2011-02-10T02:17:48  <antimatroid> it's guaranteed to take out at least one ant
2011-02-10T02:18:07  <antimatroid> you just have to be not stupid enough to have 2+ in range when it gets close
2011-02-10T02:18:16  <janzert> and really you need to take into account expected food spawns in the area, so there should be a gradient of lower density toward your central areas
2011-02-10T02:19:02  <McLeopold> is there any other weakness we can give a spread opponent, besides battle resolution?
2011-02-10T02:19:05  <janzert> such that future expected ants leaves you with a flat density
2011-02-10T02:19:36  <janzert> not without adding other features to the game I don't think so since there really isn't much else currently
2011-02-10T02:19:39  <antimatroid> i don't understand how this is such an issue, as far as i'm concertned option 1 is clearly better :\
2011-02-10T02:19:49  <janzert> and jeff would be more opposed to that I believe
2011-02-10T02:19:53  <janzert> I may be wrong though
2011-02-10T02:20:02  <antimatroid> and i am concerned about beginners being able to compete in the contest
2011-02-10T02:21:15  <McLeopold> food spawning?
2011-02-10T02:21:50  *** tapwater <tapwater!~tapwater@pool-173-74-225-160.dllstx.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: tapwater)
2011-02-10T02:21:56  <McLeopold> food has less probability spawning near an ant?
2011-02-10T02:22:22  <antimatroid> i think that has complications
2011-02-10T02:22:35  <McLeopold> it would be too hard to explain
2011-02-10T02:22:53  <antimatroid> it's so simple if we just go with 1 :(
2011-02-10T02:23:34  <antimatroid> i think it opens the door for people to use pattern matching too? which would be cool
2011-02-10T02:23:37  <McLeopold> antimatroid: then we might need to come up with examples of blocking, and ensure our maps don't contain those elements
2011-02-10T02:24:03  <McLeopold> in an open field, there is no blocking
2011-02-10T02:24:08  <antimatroid> McLeopold: no L's with walls would stop any blocking i'm pretty sure
2011-02-10T02:24:10  <McLeopold> just flanking
2011-02-10T02:24:25  <McLeopold> if we find more, we can remove them from maps
2011-02-10T02:24:29  <antimatroid> i'm not sure blocking small passages is a bad thing
2011-02-10T02:24:49  <antimatroid> but i'm happy to go with that if it means getting 1
2011-02-10T02:24:56  <antimatroid> it might be worth seeing how it goes to start though
2011-02-10T02:25:18  <McLeopold> it's like removing maps with starting planets too close
2011-02-10T02:25:38  <antimatroid> yep
2011-02-10T02:25:39  <McLeopold> or maps without a neutral that can be taken
2011-02-10T02:25:51  <McLeopold> that's the key to convincing jeff
2011-02-10T02:25:56  <antimatroid> if we play around with maps early enough, it should be testableish
2011-02-10T02:26:40  <McLeopold> If we can establish a set of parameters that minimize "permanent defense" patterns, the it would be better
2011-02-10T02:26:51  <McLeopold> any pattern where you never lose an ant
2011-02-10T02:27:19  <antimatroid> i think that L rule will give it, but i could be wrong
2011-02-10T02:27:24  <McLeopold> but, can we use a combat range of 2?
2011-02-10T02:27:32  <antimatroid> you might be able to build a more complex one, but if you can find that, good for you
2011-02-10T02:27:43  <antimatroid> that's what i want?
2011-02-10T02:27:49  <antimatroid> euclidean 2 yeah?
2011-02-10T02:28:15  <antimatroid> which is the same as manhatten 2?
2011-02-10T02:28:19  <antimatroid> so not with knights moves
2011-02-10T02:29:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: run with that, and then people can argue against it if necessary
2011-02-10T02:29:21  <McLeopold> that creates more patterns to eliminate, with range 2
2011-02-10T02:29:43  <antimatroid> what about colliding friends then? still kill them? or fuse them into one?
2011-02-10T02:30:06  <McLeopold> kill em
2011-02-10T02:30:25  <janzert> you can't even block a small passage with permanently (100% of the time) right?
2011-02-10T02:30:37  <janzert> only with about a 50% probability per ant put down it
2011-02-10T02:30:41  <antimatroid> janzert: yes but it needs to be blocked with an L
2011-02-10T02:30:41  <McLeopold> yes you can
2011-02-10T02:30:45  <antimatroid> from one side
2011-02-10T02:30:50  <antimatroid> not the other side
2011-02-10T02:31:01  <antimatroid> you could potentially block off all openings to a larger region
2011-02-10T02:31:07  <janzert> was there a diagram of it?
2011-02-10T02:31:12  <antimatroid> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1313&start=10
2011-02-10T02:31:35  <antimatroid> look for the passages and assume you've got enemies only having access down the passage
2011-02-10T02:31:45  <antimatroid> ignore option 3
2011-02-10T02:32:33  <antimatroid> but with say the 4th exampl, if that square diagonally above red isn't a wall, blue can land there, hence the no L shapes
2011-02-10T02:32:40  <janzert> right, but I still don't see how you block it permanently. If I'm coming from the top
2011-02-10T02:33:02  <antimatroid> blue sends any amount of ants down there and red kills them all
2011-02-10T02:33:05  <McLeopold> well, here's an argument for blocking not being that bad... the blocker isn't expanding
2011-02-10T02:33:05  <antimatroid> without loss
2011-02-10T02:33:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i've made that argument :P
2011-02-10T02:33:29  <janzert> not without losing one ant 50% of the time at least if I'm moving non-deterministically
2011-02-10T02:33:37  <antimatroid> what?
2011-02-10T02:34:03  <antimatroid> 4th example on that page? blue dies and 2 reds stay alive
2011-02-10T02:34:21  <antimatroid> you can even block the 2 width corridor
2011-02-10T02:34:33  <janzert> your big png of diagrams right?
2011-02-10T02:34:39  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-10T02:34:59  <janzert> the single corridor starting in the second row and the left side of the first row
2011-02-10T02:35:11  <antimatroid> second row on the right
2011-02-10T02:35:19  <antimatroid> fourther diagram :P
2011-02-10T02:35:23  <antimatroid> fourth*
2011-02-10T02:35:57  <janzert> oh, I thought with that red configuration and blue up one red lost the right ant
2011-02-10T02:36:10  <antimatroid> not with fight distance 2
2011-02-10T02:36:31  <antimatroid> blue has 2 enemies in range, each red only 1
2011-02-10T02:36:34  <antimatroid> so blue dies
2011-02-10T02:36:43  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I kinda favor a scheme where ants can be next to each other
2011-02-10T02:36:51  <antimatroid> we could combine options 1 and 2?
2011-02-10T02:36:59  <janzert> ahh, yeah that's a problem :(
2011-02-10T02:37:08  <antimatroid> nah that'd be awful
2011-02-10T02:37:09  <McLeopold> so, if you have enough backup, you can still survive
2011-02-10T02:37:24  <antimatroid> janzert: if blue has another one 2 to the right, it takes out the right red
2011-02-10T02:37:28  <McLeopold> then, you can move onto the enemy ants to kill them
2011-02-10T02:37:33  <antimatroid> so if you have no L's with walls, you're set?
2011-02-10T02:37:53  <antimatroid> really you're going to just hold their ants at bay there
2011-02-10T02:37:59  <antimatroid> and they will have to find another way in
2011-02-10T02:38:07  <antimatroid> i don't think it's necessarily bad
2011-02-10T02:38:20  <janzert> are you positive it can't be extended beyond 2 wide corridors?
2011-02-10T02:38:22  <antimatroid> it breaks down for passeges 3 wide, but you can make it tought for them to break through
2011-02-10T02:38:32  <antimatroid> janzert: there are examples of a 3 corridor
2011-02-10T02:38:37  <antimatroid> i think i convinced myself pretty well
2011-02-10T02:39:12  <antimatroid> you can almost block it, so it'd be expensive to invade
2011-02-10T02:39:25  <antimatroid> again, if there was no L's, they could get you diangonally through the walls too
2011-02-10T02:40:10  <janzert> I guess it depends somewhat on the type of maps then, I think a little more open maps aren't a big deal so it would probably work out ok
2011-02-10T02:41:10  <McLeopold> that's why we would have to find patterns and remove or reject them
2011-02-10T02:41:10  <antimatroid> yeah, i might even try and play around with making maps that have lots of passages
2011-02-10T02:41:16  <janzert> I don't think I would outright disallow it either, any map that it becomes a problem on should just be thrown out. of course that depends on a good map monitoring system :/
2011-02-10T02:41:20  <antimatroid> not small ones
2011-02-10T02:41:30  <antimatroid> just lots of different routes everywhere, but not necessarily easy to find
2011-02-10T02:42:23  <antimatroid> especially if you do no L's, then people might have to go and find a path to the other side of the wall before breaking their "blockade"
2011-02-10T02:42:31  <janzert> and a good map monitoring system according to jeff is basically trivial ;)
2011-02-10T02:42:49  <McLeopold> "just to a t-test"
2011-02-10T02:42:55  <McLeopold> piece of cake
2011-02-10T02:43:02  <antimatroid> no way we'd get the data
2011-02-10T02:43:07  <antimatroid> it's a cool idea
2011-02-10T02:44:33  <antimatroid> not for a large enough set of keepable maps anyway
2011-02-10T02:45:18  <janzert> yep. in the state space of completely random maps, good ones are way to sparse
2011-02-10T02:45:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are we going to pass the top 2 players winners about the "last" state where they make no moves?
2011-02-10T02:45:45  <antimatroid> info about*

2011-02-10T05:15:30  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/Fs8nvrry
2011-02-10T05:15:36  <antimatroid> that map is sweet
2011-02-10T05:22:43  <sigh> how many players are you guys planning to have per map?
2011-02-10T05:24:49  <sigh> antimatroid's map has twelve (if I read it right), that seems a bit hardcore :P
2011-02-10T05:28:32  <antimatroid> sigh: that's my highest atm
2011-02-10T05:28:42  <antimatroid> the nice thing about 12 is you can do 3x4
2011-02-10T05:28:59  <antimatroid> 9 has 3x3
2011-02-10T05:29:14  <antimatroid> 4 2x2, the rest are quite rank
2011-02-10T05:29:45  <antimatroid> sigh: atm i have possibleNoPlayers = [4, 6, 8, 9, 12]
2011-02-10T05:31:44  <sigh> ah, so always in a grid
2011-02-10T05:31:56  <sigh> I suppose that's simplest :P
2011-02-10T05:32:01  <antimatroid> well yeah :P
2011-02-10T05:32:13  <antimatroid> how else would you do it?
2011-02-10T05:32:33  <antimatroid> i'd love to hide starting locations, although i don't think it really matters
2011-02-10T05:32:40  <sigh> i'd probably do the same thing
2011-02-10T05:32:52  <antimatroid> you won't necessarily know how far up or along, but someone started there somewhere
2011-02-10T05:33:03  <sigh> does the map wrap?
2011-02-10T05:33:07  <antimatroid> yes
2011-02-10T05:33:17  <antimatroid> so excepting relative starting positions, it's symmetric
2011-02-10T05:33:21  <sigh> yeah
2011-02-10T05:33:23  <sigh> cool
2011-02-10T05:33:25  <antimatroid> but if you come across someone, it's not on symmetric grounds
2011-02-10T05:33:30  <sigh> :)
2011-02-10T05:33:40  <antimatroid> well, unlikely
2011-02-10T05:34:17  <antimatroid> it could be interesting to play on 1xn maps
2011-02-10T05:34:24  <antimatroid> but it's hard to fit that on a screen well
2011-02-10T05:34:32  <sigh> depends on n :D

2011-02-10T05:37:39  <antimatroid> jeff thinks the lattice maps will be boring
2011-02-10T05:37:50  <antimatroid> but i think it has the appeal of non-symmetric while being symmetric
2011-02-10T05:37:52  <sigh> what does he propose?
2011-02-10T05:38:11  <antimatroid> non-symmetric maps while using a t-test to throw out "unfair" maps
2011-02-10T05:38:30  <sigh> ahhh
2011-02-10T05:38:34  <antimatroid> it's a kind of cool idea, but i don't see it being possible to run enough games given the proportion of maps you'd throw out
2011-02-10T05:38:51  <sigh> that's not going to be very accoun-proof :P
2011-02-10T05:39:09  <antimatroid> i don't think that's a high priority :P
2011-02-10T05:39:14  <sigh> :D
2011-02-10T05:39:25  <antimatroid> i'm fairly against non-symmetric maps
2011-02-10T05:39:46  <antimatroid> i want food replenishment to be symmetric to starting positions too, but i don't think i'm getting that
2011-02-10T05:40:00  <antimatroid> and that has issues too with complicating strategy
2011-02-10T05:40:55  <sigh> why can't food replenishments be symettric?
2011-02-10T05:41:30  <antimatroid> if the symmetric square to what's chosen in a place still has a resource there, do you fill the other squares? what about if a player fills one of hte squares?
2011-02-10T05:41:42  <sigh> ahh
2011-02-10T05:42:10  <antimatroid> it might be better to put a new food square in every players starting region every n turns or something?
2011-02-10T05:42:19  <antimatroid> that's a rate of one food square per turn
2011-02-10T05:43:04  <sigh> maybe
2011-02-10T05:43:33  <antimatroid> there will be a way to provide the engine with a seed so replenishment is the same for debugging locally
2011-02-10T05:43:38  <antimatroid> but otherwise it's going to change
2011-02-10T05:43:55  <sigh> yeah, that's a must
2011-02-10T05:44:13  <antimatroid> i think there should be a way to turn it off maybe even
2011-02-10T05:44:27  <sigh> turn off what?
2011-02-10T05:44:31  <antimatroid> replenishment
2011-02-10T05:44:40  <antimatroid> so when you're testing on your own simple maps it doesn't get in the way
2011-02-10T05:46:00  <sigh> i see
2011-02-10T05:46:28  <antimatroid> http://ietherpad.com/TR0zbEqvx1

2011-02-10T05:46:44  <antimatroid> could you think of any improvements to that? :P
2011-02-10T05:48:27  <sigh> don't really have time to go over it in detail right now... have to figure out how I am going to interview job candidates tomorrow :S
2011-02-10T05:49:01  <antimatroid> yeah, sucks to be you :P
2011-02-10T05:49:11  <antimatroid> i start uni again in a bit over a week :\
2011-02-10T05:49:20  <antimatroid> one year degree, mmm
2011-02-10T05:49:36  <sigh> really, that seems early?
2011-02-10T05:49:43  <sigh> isn't it usually end of feb?
2011-02-10T05:50:22  <sigh> hmmm... maybe I'll ask them to write a map generator :P
2011-02-10T05:51:42  <antimatroid> we go back 21st, seemed early to me too
2011-02-10T05:51:52  <antimatroid> oh well, map gen is piece of piss
2011-02-10T05:51:56  <antimatroid> wouldn't really challenge anything
2011-02-10T05:52:14  <sigh> yeah... was just joking :)
2011-02-10T05:53:01  <antimatroid> ask them to write you an algorithm for finding mixed strategy nash equilibria in n-player games
2011-02-10T05:53:08  <sigh> haha
2011-02-10T05:54:56  <antimatroid> that is my current thesis topic this year, but i think it might be a little hard
2011-02-10T05:55:22  <antimatroid> the journals start talking about ring theory and grobner bases
2011-02-10T05:55:25  <antimatroid> and i'm like say what?
2011-02-10T05:55:32  <sigh> well, you seem to enjoy the topic so it should be good

2011-02-10T12:38:53  <antimatroid> basically, if you assume a square that becomes invisible while containing food or another player and it's not there when it becomes visible again, nothing alerts you other than the fact that it's technically visible and nothing has been said to you
2011-02-10T12:38:55  <antimatroid> if that makes sense?
2011-02-10T12:39:26  <antimatroid> we also weren't saying anything about dead food squares

2011-02-10T13:05:38  <McLeopold> yeah, that's makes sense
2011-02-10T13:06:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i think it would be pretty much solved if one receives info for every "visible" square each turn
2011-02-10T13:06:45  <McLeopold> only if changed
2011-02-10T13:06:58  <McLeopold> or, we give them vision radius and let them work it out
2011-02-10T13:07:24  <antimatroid> working it out is tedious
2011-02-10T13:07:39  <antimatroid> you need to determine whether the information that it is a food square is old or not
2011-02-10T13:09:19  <McLeopold> if you can see what was a food square, and it wasn't reported as anything, it is land
2011-02-10T13:10:02  <McLeopold> same with ants
2011-02-10T13:11:49  <antimatroid> yes, but you need to pick up that it's visible and wasn't reported this turn
2011-02-10T13:12:03  <antimatroid> which requires marking it as "old" information
2011-02-10T13:12:54  <antimatroid> people also need to currently work out what is or isn't visible etc.
2011-02-10T13:13:13  <antimatroid> if we passed players info for every square they can see each turn, the starter bots wouldn't even need to back up info
2011-02-10T13:15:24  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you counting dead ants from battles (and collisions)? as part of ants that can "currently" see?
2011-02-10T13:16:56  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-10T13:17:25  <McLeopold> move -> kill ants -> spawn ants -> pass new vision state
2011-02-10T13:17:47  <McLeopold> so, if you move closer to get more map info, but die, you don't get it
2011-02-10T13:18:22  <McLeopold> your vision is greater than the combat range, so you ought to know what is comming
2011-02-10T13:19:20  <antimatroid> yep, sure
2011-02-10T13:19:25  <McLeopold> I would say if food disappears, we just send an 'L' for land, not "dead food"
2011-02-10T13:19:58  <McLeopold> for ants, the player should clear their list every turn, so always assume the ants dissapear
2011-02-10T13:20:15  <McLeopold> in fact, we could do that for food
2011-02-10T13:20:23  <McLeopold> hmm..
2011-02-10T13:20:52  <antimatroid> for food... if there is a food square that isn't seeable, can you mark that as an unseen land square again or something along those lines?
2011-02-10T13:20:55  <antimatroid> that would do the trick
2011-02-10T13:21:07  <McLeopold> yeah, but that's up to the bot
2011-02-10T13:21:33  <antimatroid> my point is they might want to remember where food was at the start
2011-02-10T13:21:39  <antimatroid> and where another enemy was or something
2011-02-10T13:21:47  <McLeopold> I'm thinking give them vision radius.  This is a bot issue, not an engine issue.
2011-02-10T13:22:32  <antimatroid> i dunno, i think a change in how the engine does things can make life easier for people
2011-02-10T13:22:49  <antimatroid> it's not a complication that's interesting, just tedious
2011-02-10T13:23:07  <antimatroid> i don't mind too much though and i'm off to bed
2011-02-10T13:23:08  <antimatroid> night

2011-02-10T17:52:21  <McLeopold> janzert: where's the scoring system you commented on?
2011-02-10T17:54:50  <janzert> (10:45:17 AM) antimatroid: janzert: what about a scoring system where you get a point for every ant inside the fighting region of a dying enemy ant?
2011-02-10T17:56:10  <McLeopold> yeah, that's a little nuts
2011-02-10T17:56:34  <McLeopold> It does make you want to cluster, kinda, but it has too many other affects.
2011-02-10T17:58:51  <McLeopold> In order to "fix" the game mechanics of ants, without complex battle, we would need a scoring system that encouraged not spreading out, or a system where getting new ants costs you land.
2011-02-10T17:59:38  <McLeopold> I've thought of making new ants require all 4 squares around food to be occupied, but I don't know if that's enough.
2011-02-10T18:00:14  <McLeopold> maybe 3 ants need to be in range for a birth?
2011-02-10T18:00:27  <McLeopold> and the birth radius is smaller than the combat radius?
2011-02-10T18:01:14  <McLeopold> you could hold territory, but not gain the benefit if you didn't come in with enough
2011-02-10T18:01:42  <McLeopold> although you could still keep others away
2011-02-10T18:02:12  <McLeopold> so, 3 ants need to converge for a new ant, but there is the risk that an enemy could get a good kill ratio
2011-02-10T18:02:22  <McLeopold> janzert: ^^

2011-02-10T18:17:21  <McLeopold> or we could go back to having hills, but the scoring is 1 point per ant per turn in range, where the range is 4 or so

2011-02-10T18:39:14  <jmcarthur> ^^
2011-02-10T18:39:53  <McLeopold> so, I had some thoughts on game play
2011-02-10T18:40:03  <McLeopold> Can you read the logs?
2011-02-10T18:40:11  <Prillicy> sure
2011-02-10T18:40:13  <Prillicy> when?
2011-02-10T18:40:24  <McLeopold> Like 5 minutes before you joined
2011-02-10T18:41:52  *** javagamer <javagamer!~javagamer@ool-4356dfec.dyn.optonline.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-10T18:42:11  <McLeopold> If we allow more complex attacks, or formations, then, the balance issue may be solved.  But, I'd like to talk about ways to keep the "easy" combat and still make the game balanced.
2011-02-10T18:42:52  <Prillicy> I don't know if threesomes produce offspring that often
2011-02-10T18:42:55  <McLeopold> I'm going to bring out my ban hammer to ensure no one talks about "options".
2011-02-10T18:43:14  <McLeopold> :) too much thinking...
2011-02-10T18:43:24  <Prillicy> just saying
2011-02-10T18:43:29  <McLeopold> Go with the zombie theme then :)
2011-02-10T18:43:40  <Prillicy> you're increasing the risk required to get food
2011-02-10T18:43:54  <Prillicy> which is, again, discouraging getting food
2011-02-10T18:44:03  <McLeopold> again, what did that before?
2011-02-10T18:44:13  <Prillicy> enemy ants
2011-02-10T18:44:34  <McLeopold> how did that discourage getting food?
2011-02-10T18:44:49  <Prillicy> because you had to leave the cluster of safety with other ants nearby
2011-02-10T18:45:06  <Prillicy> so here's what I'm seeing
2011-02-10T18:45:11  <McLeopold> oh, assume we are using the easy battle rules, the one where everyone needs to spread out
2011-02-10T18:45:30  <Prillicy> a bunch of extremely skilled coders are looking for a way to make a simple game more complex, am I correct?  The game is "too simple" in your opinions
2011-02-10T18:45:43  <McLeopold> No, I'm on the other side.
2011-02-10T18:45:58  <McLeopold> I want interesting macro, not micro.
2011-02-10T18:46:04  <Prillicy> so you're simply trying to develop a way to counteract the easier battle rules
2011-02-10T18:46:11  <McLeopold> Yes
2011-02-10T18:46:31  <Prillicy> in that regard this method is effective enough to force ants to group in "squads"
2011-02-10T18:46:37  <McLeopold> To keep the game balanced, to prevent the strategy from always being "spread out and attack"
2011-02-10T18:46:58  <McLeopold> right, and if you see an enemy ant, you need to ungroup slightly
2011-02-10T18:46:58  <Prillicy> additionally, loss of members of the squad will force the coder to develop a way to retreat to where other allies may be
2011-02-10T18:47:26  <McLeopold> So, is this enough to bring balance back?  Or does it just make it more complicated without good effect?
2011-02-10T18:47:43  <Prillicy> however, I think that what's going to happen is people will have a group of ants in their "base" mining for food while the others charge out blindly one at a time
2011-02-10T18:48:16  <McLeopold> right, so from a big picture, instead of spreading out with single ants, you just spread out with squads
2011-02-10T18:48:23  <Prillicy> incorrect
2011-02-10T18:48:34  <Prillicy> you spread with single ants, until enough ants make it to a point to form a squad
2011-02-10T18:48:43  <Prillicy> then you spread further with single ants, leaving squads behind
2011-02-10T18:48:54  <Prillicy> essentially, a single ant could take out an entire squad mining for food
2011-02-10T18:49:05  <Prillicy> so you still want to charge with individual ants
2011-02-10T18:49:27  <McLeopold> so, single ants for defense and offense, squads for collecting food
2011-02-10T18:49:37  <Prillicy> exactly
2011-02-10T18:49:43  <Prillicy> it does create a need for a squad
2011-02-10T18:49:56  <Prillicy> which is an improvement in my opinion by making them more "ant-like"
2011-02-10T18:49:59  <McLeopold> does it provide conflicting objectives so that the game is interesting?
2011-02-10T18:50:03  <Prillicy> remember, my main goal here is to keep realizm
2011-02-10T18:50:25  <Prillicy> it provides the need for very complex starter packs
2011-02-10T18:50:33  <Prillicy> and the need to start with more than 1 ant
2011-02-10T18:50:58  <Prillicy> remember, the more complex the game is, the more complex the starter packs must be
2011-02-10T18:51:38  <Prillicy> which means, the less likely less capable programmers are going to try to mod the starter pack beyond the main function/method
2011-02-10T18:52:03  <Prillicy> I was wondering, could i build the c# starter pack this time?
2011-02-10T18:52:35  <McLeopold> why not
2011-02-10T18:52:50  <Prillicy> well, the challenge is knowing what the computer will output
2011-02-10T18:53:06  <McLeopold> you mean, the communication protocol?
2011-02-10T18:53:09  <Prillicy> yeah
2011-02-10T18:53:18  <McLeopold> http://ietherpad.com/TR0zbEqvx1
2011-02-10T18:53:21  <Prillicy> thanks
2011-02-10T18:53:21  <McLeopold> it's a work in progress
2011-02-10T18:53:34  <Prillicy> it's probably going to change I'm sure
2011-02-10T18:53:41  <Prillicy> but that will let me get started on a starter pack
2011-02-10T18:53:50  <Prillicy> anyhow, let me try and wrap my head around this
2011-02-10T18:54:08  <Prillicy> to start, you'll be a tightly packed group of ants (group necessary due to the new food rules)
2011-02-10T18:54:38  <Prillicy> so your bot will be programmed to spread to the edges of group vision to find food, and somehow notify the group to follow when you see food
2011-02-10T18:55:12  <Prillicy> you could continue in this way in order to gather food....
2011-02-10T18:55:29  <Prillicy> question: how long does it take to get the food? is it still instant, or do so many ants have to be in range for so many rounds?
2011-02-10T18:55:54  <McLeopold> let's say instant
2011-02-10T18:56:05  <Prillicy> well, then we're at the same place we were.
2011-02-10T18:56:20  <Prillicy> this only encourages ants to stay at the edge of vision, briefly closing when one ant finds food
2011-02-10T18:56:27  <Prillicy> I gotta run to the store
2011-02-10T18:56:29  <Prillicy> bbia
2011-02-10T18:56:31  <Prillicy> b
2011-02-10T18:57:02  <McLeopold> so, then, consider my hills idea
2011-02-10T18:57:08  <McLeopold> when you get back
2011-02-10T19:00:25  <Frontier> You are a hillbilly. But any sort of additional complexity would make the game more diverse at this point. I totally agree with the point of finding a factor the favors sticking together
2011-02-10T19:08:39  <McLeopold> Well, the game is easy to play.  You have a list of ants, you can send them somewhere.
2011-02-10T19:08:58  <McLeopold> Having different objectives isn't really that much more complex.
2011-02-10T19:10:07  <McLeopold> Having pros and cons to each choice of where to send ants gives the game more depth.  We just need to pros and cons to be easy to reason about and understand.
2011-02-10T19:10:56  <McLeopold> right now, there is no drawback to attacking all out
2011-02-10T19:11:01  <McLeopold> in a 2 player game
2011-02-10T19:11:50  <McLeopold> the only other level of complexity would be coordination with other bots, which may be too difficult unless we give the players a mechanism for simple communication
2011-02-10T19:12:58  <McLeopold> If we can make bots suffer from "early leader syndrome" then there is now a drawback to expanding fast, which is the other players will tend to gang up against you.
2011-02-10T19:13:09  <McLeopold> if they are smart
2011-02-10T19:18:22  *** Meatkat <Meatkat!~bovard@41.203.224.168> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-10T19:27:24  <Frontier> Oh... that sounds like Risk
2011-02-10T19:28:40  <Frontier> When I play risk with my family, everyone expects me to be the root of all evil - dont know why - and that made the most peaceful player - my mother - win last time
2011-02-10T19:29:59  <McLeopold> yeah, me too
2011-02-10T19:30:03  <Frontier> McLeopold: How would you recognize an early leader? Communication from other players can not be trusted and the fog of war makes it difficult to estimate the strength
2011-02-10T19:30:37  <McLeopold> that's part of the fun?
2011-02-10T19:31:34  <McLeopold> we'd lose the fog of war and hidden number of players if we really wanted it
2011-02-10T19:31:53  <McLeopold> but then, communication still can't be trusted
2011-02-10T19:32:13  <Frontier> hey something is communicating with my computer 5 KB up & down... suspicious
2011-02-10T19:33:24  <Frontier> oh it is this website from some indy game developer
2011-02-10T19:35:52  <Frontier> McLeopold: I have a feeling that a losing player will often appear as expanding to others because it is pushed in a direction
2011-02-10T19:37:26  <Frontier> But that shouldn't be our concern at this point. We just have to make sure the game has no single strong strategy to winning
2011-02-10T19:39:20  <Frontier> I wonder if there is a new spec for the visualizer? There are no ant ids, no directions, but other things to be added.
2011-02-10T19:39:55  <Prillicy> spit out the hills idea
2011-02-10T19:40:03  <Prillicy> and if there is no fog of war, there is no need to communicate
2011-02-10T19:40:15  <Frontier> What would be the best practice to handle differently dimensioned maps? Maps of 50x100 or 200x200 can hardly be displayed at the same scale
2011-02-10T19:40:48  <McLeopold> make the visualizer be able to scale
2011-02-10T19:40:58  <Prillicy> not hard to do
2011-02-10T19:41:04  <McLeopold> use local storage to remember a persons preference
2011-02-10T19:41:08  <Prillicy> I wrote that for my home page
2011-02-10T19:41:26  <McLeopold> or cookies
2011-02-10T19:41:28  <Prillicy> oh, not the preference
2011-02-10T19:41:31  <Frontier> Especially with the matrix functions it isn't hard to do, no.
2011-02-10T19:42:07  <Prillicy> McLeopold: ajax and gets will allow players to share their games at certain sizes
2011-02-10T19:42:31  <Frontier> share?
2011-02-10T19:42:59  <Prillicy> when you see a game, you post a link
2011-02-10T19:43:08  <Prillicy> if the link is a get with the sizing
2011-02-10T19:43:10  <Frontier> ah ok, so the scale is in the link
2011-02-10T19:43:15  <Prillicy> yeah
2011-02-10T19:43:43  <Prillicy> that would be nice for me though, I'm on 1028x600 on my netbook here
2011-02-10T19:43:46  <Frontier> what if people copy the adress line - i do that usually
2011-02-10T19:44:09  <Prillicy> ?
2011-02-10T19:44:16  <Frontier> then the scale is stillt the old scale, not the one i selected in the visualizer
2011-02-10T19:44:26  <Prillicy> allowing for people to chose
2011-02-10T19:44:29  <Prillicy> *choose
2011-02-10T19:44:30  <Frontier> or does the adress line change with an ajax request?
2011-02-10T19:44:42  <Prillicy> that's what I mean
2011-02-10T19:44:52  <Prillicy> you can still resize from what you start with (with or without get)
2011-02-10T19:45:03  <Prillicy> just post the resizes to the url
2011-02-10T19:45:22  <Prillicy> I guess by post I mean get, but that sounds wierd
2011-02-10T19:45:26  <Frontier> How about the game is just always scaled to fit the screen?
2011-02-10T19:45:48  <Prillicy> I'm just offering that it's nice to zoom in
2011-02-10T19:46:02  <Frontier> ok, i agree :)
2011-02-10T19:46:32  <Prillicy> besides, my way is easier than auto-scaling to screen size
2011-02-10T19:46:35  <Frontier> Mouse wheel zoom and dragging with the lmb should be fine
2011-02-10T19:46:48  <Prillicy> screen size code is horrible for web development
2011-02-10T19:47:20  <Frontier> I would try to find a working solution on the web for Firefox, Chrome, IE and Opera
2011-02-10T19:47:52  <Prillicy> which is 3 different portions of code
2011-02-10T19:48:10  <Frontier> which browsers share their code?
2011-02-10T19:48:43  <Prillicy> chrome & opera
2011-02-10T19:48:51  <Prillicy> they both use css3
2011-02-10T19:49:08  <Prillicy> I do a lot of web dev
2011-02-10T19:49:48  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: what's with the crazy birth rule? just go with option 1 already :P
2011-02-10T19:49:49  <jbroman> Prillicy: CSS3 is a standard, not a body of code.
2011-02-10T19:50:07  <jbroman> Prillicy: IE also implements (parts of) CSS3.
2011-02-10T19:50:22  <Prillicy> you need 1 body of code to account for css3, 1 for ie fixes, and 1 for mozilla
2011-02-10T19:50:34  <Prillicy> believe me, I"ve built screen-resizing stuff before
2011-02-10T19:51:42  <Prillicy> it's a mess
2011-02-10T19:52:36  <Prillicy> I am hosting a website on a basic cable internet connection, shared with 4 roomates + myself and ripping out ie fixes has allowed that website to still have great load-times in spite of the connection
2011-02-10T19:52:51  <Prillicy> *2 websites
2011-02-10T19:53:11  <Frontier> found a function: http://codepad.org/HzLyGlEV
2011-02-10T19:53:26  <antimatroid1> Frontier; have you looked on etherpad about the visualiser?
2011-02-10T19:53:38  <Frontier> not yet
2011-02-10T19:53:42  <Prillicy> not screen size
2011-02-10T19:53:47  <Prillicy> but ok
2011-02-10T19:53:49  <antimatroid1> http://ietherpad.com/TR0zbEqvx1
2011-02-10T19:53:52  <Prillicy> you're referring to browser size
2011-02-10T19:54:02  <antimatroid1> i put a very flexible outline there that i think could make a cool visualiser
2011-02-10T19:54:17  <Frontier> Prillicy: Well what I really need is the inner window size. I wan't clear about that.
2011-02-10T19:54:18  <antimatroid1> but of course I have no idea with making them, so feel free to change it
2011-02-10T19:55:21  <Prillicy> fair enough, that's pretty easy with dom (as you just demonstrated) though usually I find I have to add a fix for ie anyway
2011-02-10T19:55:28  <Frontier> thanks for the bold font on head lines ;)
2011-02-10T19:55:54  <McLeopold> Frontier: a canvas can be any size, and you can scale an image on it any way.  You'll want zoom and wrap around.
2011-02-10T19:56:45  <Prillicy> wait, you'rereferring to one bot controlling multiple ants, I thought the whole point was one bot per ant
2011-02-10T19:57:02  <Frontier> McLeopold: That's what we said
2011-02-10T19:57:06  <McLeopold> Prillicy: nope
2011-02-10T19:57:16  <Frontier> except for the wrap part ^^
2011-02-10T19:57:18  <McLeopold> too complicated for the backend
2011-02-10T19:57:27  <antimatroid1> Prillicy: all friend ants share the same info, too much overhead
2011-02-10T19:57:45  <McLeopold> fog of war really slows down the engine :(
2011-02-10T19:58:15  <antimatroid1> how much are you doing for it each turn?
2011-02-10T19:58:32  <McLeopold> I've got a naive algo.
2011-02-10T19:58:46  <antimatroid1> if you didn't store info about what people had/hadn't seen and passed more input (all visible squares each turn just by painting outwards) would it be faster?
2011-02-10T19:58:48  <McLeopold> the get_vision function should return a matrix of true/false
2011-02-10T19:59:11  <McLeopold> probably not
2011-02-10T19:59:27  <McLeopold> the slowdown is in finding what is currently visible
2011-02-10T19:59:50  <antimatroid1> yeah fair enough, i found that wasn't as trivial as i thought to work out
2011-02-10T19:59:51  <McLeopold> I'm looping through each ant and "painting" a circle.  So, the more ants, the slower it is.
2011-02-10T20:00:03  <McLeopold> I'm thinking I should just to a map scan.
2011-02-10T20:00:10  <antimatroid1> i first scanned out from ants sequentially, which causes you to screw up if you try to use the same "visited" information
2011-02-10T20:00:36  <antimatroid1> yeah, i scan out from each players ants and only check a square once
2011-02-10T20:00:40  <Frontier> When should the ants that die fade out? During the turn that kills them or afterwards?
2011-02-10T20:00:42  <McLeopold> If 2 ants are next to each other, I'm painting a lot of the same squares as "can see".
2011-02-10T20:01:02  <antimatroid1> Frontier: atm there are different ways for an ant to die, from a collision or a battle
2011-02-10T20:01:27  <McLeopold> Frontier: for the game, a dead ant will only be shown for 1 turn, so if you walked into the area 1 turn later, you wouldn't know.
2011-02-10T20:02:07  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: if you want into view of an ant that just died, you see that aye?
2011-02-10T20:02:10  <McLeopold> The visualizer can do anything, including counting the amount of ants that die in a square
2011-02-10T20:02:12  <antimatroid1> how do we visualise that fact
2011-02-10T20:02:21  <antimatroid1> walk*
2011-02-10T20:02:50  <Frontier> I cannot see from the basic input if an ant died from collision or battle
2011-02-10T20:03:01  <antimatroid1> Frontier: i know, that needs fixing
2011-02-10T20:03:31  <Frontier> So you DO want some different visualization in each case?
2011-02-10T20:04:14  <Frontier> lol, kill food from collision, don't be silly :o)
2011-02-10T20:04:16  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to work out what you need?
2011-02-10T20:04:31  <antimatroid1> Frontier: food is to die if it's contested for?
2011-02-10T20:04:47  <Frontier> oh I should read more *g*
2011-02-10T20:04:50  <McLeopold> Frontier: depending on the final attack range, you can make assumptions for kill/collision
2011-02-10T20:05:41  <Prillicy> if one bot controls everything, there's no need for communication
2011-02-10T20:05:44  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I'm not sending dead food info.
2011-02-10T20:05:48  <Frontier> McLeopold: You are right, it is more a design decision if the visualizer is just a display device or makes its own calculations
2011-02-10T20:05:59  <Prillicy> and in terms of fog of war, I think you're working backward is what's slowing you down
2011-02-10T20:06:05  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: so you just know it died by the lack of it being reported?
2011-02-10T20:06:15  <antimatroid1> i don't like this having to search for stuff just because the input format sucks
2011-02-10T20:06:18  <McLeopold> for food, yes

2011-02-10T20:06:55  <antimatroid1> it's making it unecessarily complicated to track it

2011-02-10T20:08:17  <Prillicy> you should build the map with a array of the ants as a property
2011-02-10T20:08:28  <Prillicy> each ant gets a true or false per square
2011-02-10T20:08:41  <Prillicy> then feed that to the ants

2011-02-10T20:09:59  <antimatroid1> Prillicy: me backwards?
2011-02-10T20:10:00  <Prillicy> assign variables as you go, don't do more loops than are necessary
2011-02-10T20:10:07  <Prillicy> yes
2011-02-10T20:10:15  <Prillicy> you're looping through the map for each ant
2011-02-10T20:10:20  <antimatroid1> no i'm not
2011-02-10T20:10:22  <Prillicy> loop through the ants for each map
2011-02-10T20:10:27  <Prillicy> see the number of loops that differ here?
2011-02-10T20:10:44  <antimatroid1> i add each ants location to a queue, then scan outwards finding squares in range
2011-02-10T20:11:03  <Prillicy> ah, I can't read your code because I can't put it in context
2011-02-10T20:11:29  <Prillicy> I tried it's like looking at a ball of cotton candy having never heard of one
2011-02-10T20:11:33  <McLeopold> I'm looping through ants, then looping through a list of squares they can see, setting them to true.
2011-02-10T20:11:43  <Prillicy> backward
2011-02-10T20:11:51  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: add players locations to a queue, then do it all from that
2011-02-10T20:12:15  <antimatroid1> that way you add a visible square and assign it to the closest player to it, so you don't miss squares
2011-02-10T20:12:24  <Prillicy> let me reword what I'm thinking 'cause that sounds like what I was saying even to me
2011-02-10T20:12:59  <Prillicy> the visible area should be part of the ant, i.e. the ant's location includes that area, so you would begin placing the ant as you hit that square when building the map
2011-02-10T20:14:07  <McLeopold> Prillicy: I'm building a mask for what a player can see.
2011-02-10T20:14:49  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: you are doing each ant sequentially yes?, so you go through squares more than one ant can see more than once?
2011-02-10T20:14:53  <antimatroid1> or are you doing what i am

2011-02-10T20:15:33  <Prillicy> for each square of the map, check if ants are within visible range, and assign them visibility to that square
2011-02-10T20:15:42  <Prillicy> that's worse code
2011-02-10T20:15:46  <Prillicy> why did I even sayt hat
2011-02-10T20:15:50  * Prillicy facepalms
2011-02-10T20:16:02  <McLeopold> Prillicy: there is one bot controlling many ants.
2011-02-10T20:16:40  <Prillicy> that's because the multi-instance scenario won't be possible until the rewrite is complete?
2011-02-10T20:16:41  <McLeopold> I don't need a separate mask per ant, just the union of their masks
2011-02-10T20:17:04  <McLeopold> At this point, "cause jeff said so"
2011-02-10T20:17:17  <Prillicy> then, build distance between the ants first
2011-02-10T20:17:19  <Prillicy> and go from there
2011-02-10T20:17:28  <McLeopold> between?
2011-02-10T20:17:32  <Prillicy> yes
2011-02-10T20:17:36  <McLeopold> between what?
2011-02-10T20:17:40  <Prillicy> the ants are placed based on x and y right?
2011-02-10T20:17:44  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-10T20:17:47  <j3camero> McLeopold: that\s unfair. We don't do one-process-per-ant because it's infeasible, not because I said so.
2011-02-10T20:17:50  <Prillicy> so build out distance formulas
2011-02-10T20:17:59  <Prillicy> this will ensure you don't double map squares
2011-02-10T20:18:20  <McLeopold> j3camero: sry, it was easier to just say that, cause us programmer always try to solve a problem.
2011-02-10T20:18:26  <antimatroid1> can someone please tell me why my way doesn't work as fast? i'd rather make it faster if possible
2011-02-10T20:18:32  <Prillicy> j3camero: but you're in charge, this means by default everything is blamed on you
2011-02-10T20:18:51  <Prillicy> antimatroid1: could you comment your code?
2011-02-10T20:20:22  <Prillicy> based on an ant's x & y, you can determine both the distance between them, and what squares they would share
2011-02-10T20:20:24  <Prillicy> makes sense to me.
2011-02-10T20:20:30  <antimatroid1> Prillicy: http://codepad.org/mFWRjad7
2011-02-10T20:20:34  <Prillicy> thanks
2011-02-10T20:21:57  <Frontier> The good thing is, it works on a per ant basis
2011-02-10T20:22:01  <Prillicy> your code is good, but it's not what he want
2011-02-10T20:22:03  <Prillicy> s
2011-02-10T20:22:14  <Prillicy> he doesn't want to build the whole map, ideally, he's building the player map
2011-02-10T20:22:15  <antimatroid1> he wants what is fastest yes?
2011-02-10T20:22:19  <Frontier> and it doesn't check squares twice
2011-02-10T20:22:28  <antimatroid1> i want the fastest
2011-02-10T20:22:38  <antimatroid1> i plan to use that with my state evaluation
2011-02-10T20:22:39  <Prillicy> he only wants to build out the squares that the player can see, ignoring the rest of the map for speed
2011-02-10T20:22:48  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I'm not good at c++, I don't really get it.
2011-02-10T20:22:55  <Frontier> antimatroid1: then maybe get rid of the allocations of pair<>s in the inner loop
2011-02-10T20:23:08  <antimatroid1> Frontier: i'll strip that stuff later
2011-02-10T20:23:37  <Prillicy> McLeopold: you're getting a nested loop
2011-02-10T20:23:44  <Prillicy> this is the problem
2011-02-10T20:23:46  <Frontier> Yeah, it looks like you know C++ with that initalization on the first line :)
2011-02-10T20:23:51  <Prillicy> how many nests are you doing currently?
2011-02-10T20:24:01  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: take a queue of ant locations, but you also need to know which ant the location was referring to, then use that queue to paint outwards for squares that are "currently" visible
2011-02-10T20:24:04  <McLeopold> hold on
2011-02-10T20:24:18  <Prillicy> 'cause antimatroid does 2 loops, 1 nested
2011-02-10T20:24:23  <Prillicy> I'm doing 1 nested loop
2011-02-10T20:24:25  <McLeopold> antimatroid: that's what I'm doing?
2011-02-10T20:24:46  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: are you doing the whole lot at once, or separately?
2011-02-10T20:24:58  <antimatroid1> if you do it separately, you visit lots of squares more than once
2011-02-10T20:24:59  <McLeopold> once for each player
2011-02-10T20:25:10  <antimatroid1> you want to do it all in one sweep
2011-02-10T20:25:11  <Prillicy> my loop is (ant*ant) which is smaller than (squares*ant)
2011-02-10T20:25:12  <McLeopold> "visiting" squares isn't really a performance hit
2011-02-10T20:25:26  <antimatroid1> it is when you are doing it lots and testing each square for visibility etc.
2011-02-10T20:25:40  <Prillicy> what is killing performance?
2011-02-10T20:26:08  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py
2011-02-10T20:26:10  <antimatroid1> i'm guessing the fact that mcleopold is basically finding each ants visbility then unioning them
2011-02-10T20:26:11  <Prillicy> if you are truly doing (visible*ant) nest, then you're probably doing one of the smallest possible loops
2011-02-10T20:26:16  <McLeopold> look for "get_vision"
2011-02-10T20:26:24  <Frontier> { You need one map per player, so an algorithm that can generate them all in one sweep would be nice }
2011-02-10T20:26:59  <McLeopold> I already have an index of ant locations, by player.
2011-02-10T20:27:08  <Prillicy> double nested loop
2011-02-10T20:27:36  <Prillicy> is that python?
2011-02-10T20:27:42  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-10T20:27:51  <Prillicy> I just started learning that, whadoyaknow
2011-02-10T20:27:52  <Frontier> double nested loop is not bad per se. it depends on the actual numbers
2011-02-10T20:28:12  <McLeopold> so, the inner 2 loops produce a unique list of square offsets that are visible from a location
2011-02-10T20:28:27  <Prillicy> what does the third loop do?
2011-02-10T20:28:36  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: try what i'm saying and see if it speeds up
2011-02-10T20:28:40  <McLeopold> so for each ant, for each visible square, set to true
2011-02-10T20:28:43  <Prillicy> couldn't you use an area formula?
2011-02-10T20:29:00  <McLeopold> Prillicy: it is precalculated
2011-02-10T20:29:11  * Frontier sets up a programmig contest for the problem
2011-02-10T20:29:17  <Prillicy> your third loop is what's hurting you
2011-02-10T20:29:21  <Prillicy> let me fiddle with this
2011-02-10T20:29:34  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I don't know what the hell you're trying to get me to do. :P
2011-02-10T20:29:42  <antimatroid1> paint outwards :P
2011-02-10T20:29:56  <antimatroid1> do you understand how to paint a grid with a queue?
2011-02-10T20:29:57  <McLeopold> write some pseudo code ,or python
2011-02-10T20:29:59  <Prillicy> where does d_row d_col come from?
2011-02-10T20:30:24  <McLeopold> that's the precalc, it's a list of offsets a location can see
2011-02-10T20:30:27  <Prillicy> antimatroid's code would be less resource intensive than yours
2011-02-10T20:30:43  <antimatroid1> can someone write mine in python for that?
2011-02-10T20:30:48  <antimatroid1> i'm very much a python newb
2011-02-10T20:30:48  <McLeopold> so, radius 1 produces the list [ (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0) [
2011-02-10T20:30:51  <Prillicy> offsets? as in squares locations or offsets as in 1 square away
2011-02-10T20:31:07  <antimatroid1> and i keep writing pythong
2011-02-10T20:31:10  <Prillicy> I kinda know c++ and kinda know python

2011-02-10T20:40:35  <McLeopold> for r in range(radius+1): and for d_row, d_col in RADIUS[r]
2011-02-10T20:40:57  <McLeopold> the inside of that runs once per unique square an ant can see
2011-02-10T20:41:09  <Prillicy> so why do you have to nest that loop?
2011-02-10T20:41:21  <McLeopold> it was to support the death function
2011-02-10T20:41:46  <McLeopold> I could rewrite it to the precalulated radius contains all squares <= instead of =
2011-02-10T20:41:48  <Prillicy> I could see: for ant in ants { for size*2 in visibleRange{}} as a nested loop
2011-02-10T20:42:13  <Prillicy> just so that you don't have to manually build the visual range
2011-02-10T20:42:19  <Prillicy> and you could adjust size
2011-02-10T20:42:42  <McLeopold> RADIUS[size] is the lookup to get a list of precalculated offsets.
2011-02-10T20:43:10  <Prillicy> so what is r in range(radius+1)
2011-02-10T20:43:40  <McLeopold> The RADIUS[size] only gives the list of squares equal to that radius, not less than and equal to.
2011-02-10T20:43:47  <McLeopold> like I said, I can optimize that.
2011-02-10T20:44:01  <Prillicy> is RADIUS core python?
2011-02-10T20:44:10  <McLeopold> no, look at the top
2011-02-10T20:44:15  <Prillicy> then throw all of that code out
2011-02-10T20:44:31  <Prillicy> you're seriously hindering yourself by expanding the radius out 1 pixel at a time
2011-02-10T20:44:43  <Prillicy> I understand the reason
2011-02-10T20:44:48  <Prillicy> but it's going to slow your code down
2011-02-10T20:44:49  <McLeopold> i needed it for the death code, but yes, let me redo that
2011-02-10T20:45:14  <Prillicy> I'm not talking about the death code :P
2011-02-10T20:45:41  <Prillicy> I'm going to try to build this game on my computer
2011-02-10T20:46:09  <Prillicy> I just need to get comfortable first...
2011-02-10T20:47:32  * Frontier considers installing an apache2 server to test ajax & php with the visualizer
2011-02-10T20:48:45  <Prillicy> alright, let's see if I can build a 1 ant visual radius
2011-02-10T20:49:51  <Prillicy> McLeopold: do you know c#
2011-02-10T20:50:13  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-02-10T20:50:32  <Prillicy> well, if I build this in c# will you be able to read it?
2011-02-10T20:50:38  <McLeopold> hopefully
2011-02-10T20:50:39  * antimatroid1 still thinks you should do what i am
2011-02-10T20:50:46  <Prillicy> otherwise it will be my first program in python
2011-02-10T20:50:50  <McLeopold> so do i, i just don't understand it
2011-02-10T20:50:50  <Prillicy> antimatroid1: he is doing what you're doing
2011-02-10T20:50:54  <Prillicy> he's just doing it backward
2011-02-10T20:51:08  <Prillicy> he's using his old code to do it, which is hurting him
2011-02-10T20:51:22  <CIA-15> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r31a6531 / ants/ants.py : Unrolled a loop for get_vision. - http://bit.ly/fJSWaw
2011-02-10T20:51:27  <McLeopold> okay, check it now
2011-02-10T20:51:49  <j3camero> I am still stuck on getting the #$%^ user_sadbox to work in non-security mode so I can test the engine. I have to stop working for today. Grrrr.
2011-02-10T20:51:53  <Prillicy> can you just pastebin that part of the code?
2011-02-10T20:52:10  <McLeopold> j3camero: don't worry about sadbox, just use the crap I wrote
2011-02-10T20:52:15  <McLeopold> it's good enough for now
2011-02-10T20:52:29  <McLeopold> I'm running games with bots in their own process.
2011-02-10T20:52:55  <Prillicy> that is significantly better
2011-02-10T20:52:57  <McLeopold> j3camero: also, check out the new game.py file.
2011-02-10T20:53:08  <Prillicy> just because of the removal of extra loops
2011-02-10T20:53:20  <McLeopold> Okay, so, I'm still painting lots of the same squares if ants are close to each other
2011-02-10T20:53:20  <Prillicy> you were making a 4 layer nest into a 5 layer one
2011-02-10T20:54:08  <Prillicy> the only thing you could do to stop that is have an if in the function that if that square had been hit before, skip it, but it's a small performance boost
2011-02-10T20:54:25  <McLeopold> The only other way I can think of speeding this up is to ignore redundant ants (don't know how yet) or to do a map scan with some tricky method of finding close ants first.
2011-02-10T20:54:27  <Prillicy> on that note, I'm going to focus on my starter pack instead
2011-02-10T20:54:41  <Prillicy> you could run a nested ant loop
2011-02-10T20:54:45  <McLeopold> I'm not checking the status of a square.
2011-02-10T20:54:54  <Prillicy> give each ant distances to every other ant
2011-02-10T20:55:01  <McLeopold> I set a value to true, can't speed that up
2011-02-10T20:55:21  <McLeopold> I could solve the convex hull problem and only do those ants
2011-02-10T20:55:46  <antimatroid1> Prillicy: is the scan happening for all ants simultaneously or sequentially?
2011-02-10T20:55:54  <Prillicy> sequentially, why?
2011-02-10T20:55:58  <antimatroid1> you can't do it sequentially and mark squares as visited
2011-02-10T20:55:59  <antimatroid1> it breaks
2011-02-10T20:56:03  <antimatroid1> that's how i initially did it
2011-02-10T20:56:04  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I'm not doing it with threads?
2011-02-10T20:56:14  <Prillicy> huh?
2011-02-10T20:56:14  <McLeopold> i don't even know that that means
2011-02-10T20:56:34  <Prillicy> antimatroid1: if you thread it, then you're not giving a real performance boost, you're faking one
2011-02-10T20:56:49  <antimatroid1> you can paint out from an ant it's whole view radius, then for each other ant (sequentially), or you can paint out from all ants at one (simultaneous)
2011-02-10T20:56:49  <Prillicy> and in reality, that would cause the server to crash when a lot of people are watching battles
2011-02-10T20:56:51  <antimatroid1> not actual threads
2011-02-10T20:57:06  <Prillicy> ah, I see what you're saying
2011-02-10T20:57:12  <McLeopold> I dont
2011-02-10T20:57:19  <antimatroid1> if you do the first with marking squares as visited, the algorithm breaks
2011-02-10T20:57:28  <Prillicy> again, that requires more loops than painting from each ant
2011-02-10T20:57:44  <Prillicy> and you're wrong about the algorithm breaking
2011-02-10T20:57:52  <antimatroid1> no i'm not
2011-02-10T20:58:01  <Prillicy> the squares are all false
2011-02-10T20:58:05  <antimatroid1> consider ....a.a.........
2011-02-10T20:58:15  <McLeopold> marking a square as visited is more expensive than setting the matrix value to true
2011-02-10T20:58:16  <Prillicy> ok
2011-02-10T20:58:18  <antimatroid1> if you do left a's vision first, you'll mark around other a as visited, then he can't scan out
2011-02-10T20:58:30  <McLeopold> the inside of the loop is value=true, it's not expensive
2011-02-10T20:58:35  <Prillicy> you're thinking there's a visited variable here
2011-02-10T20:58:39  <Prillicy> he's skipping that
2011-02-10T20:58:44  <antimatroid1> i said if you do that it doesn't work
2011-02-10T20:58:47  <Prillicy> each ant simply sets its visible squares to true
2011-02-10T20:58:48  <antimatroid1> a big if there :P
2011-02-10T20:59:02  <Prillicy> anyway, I'm trying to build a starter pack here, I've only named the clas
2011-02-10T20:59:28  <antimatroid1> anyway, now you know not to make that mistake
2011-02-10T20:59:43  <McLeopold> Prillicy: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/bots/MyBot.py
2011-02-10T20:59:49  <McLeopold> there's a python starter bot
2011-02-10T20:59:52  <McLeopold> pretty simple
2011-02-10T20:59:57  <McLeopold> It's random bot
2011-02-10T21:00:10  <Prillicy> thanks
2011-02-10T21:00:20  <Prillicy> I'm going to use this to learn python also
2011-02-10T21:00:25  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/bots/ants.py
2011-02-10T21:00:27  <McLeopold> and this ^^
2011-02-10T21:00:45  <McLeopold> do you know list comprehensions?
2011-02-10T21:01:18  <antimatroid1> i learnt about them with haskell
2011-02-10T21:01:21  <antimatroid1> they're the shit
2011-02-10T21:01:36  <Prillicy> neat
2011-02-10T21:01:53  <Prillicy> list comprehensions? I think I was reading about those
2011-02-10T21:02:10  <McLeopold> [0 for i in range(10)] makes an array of 10 zeros.
2011-02-10T21:02:30  <Prillicy> yeah
2011-02-10T21:02:38  <antimatroid1> i think i may have gone overboard overloading pre and post fix ++ on state's for ending turns and iterating states
2011-02-10T21:02:40  <McLeopold> [['blah' for i in range(10)] for j in range(10)] makes a matrix of 10x10 strings
2011-02-10T21:03:04  <antimatroid1> i like haskells syntax, it's more set like
2011-02-10T21:03:28  <McLeopold> yeah, python takes math concepts and turns them into pseudo code
2011-02-10T21:03:34  <Prillicy> I do have to say, the one thing I don't like about python is reading right to left like that
2011-02-10T21:03:42  <McLeopold> it's always halfway between math and code
2011-02-10T21:04:05  <antimatroid1> i'm still not sold on whitespace meaning something
2011-02-10T21:04:44  <McLeopold> If there's only one way to do it, then every can read the code easier.  That's the idea.
2011-02-10T21:04:57  <McLeopold> It's forced indentation
2011-02-10T21:05:08  <Prillicy> I like that whitespace has meaning
2011-02-10T21:05:10  <Prillicy> I indent anyway
2011-02-10T21:05:29  <antimatroid1> i always indent, but yeah
2011-02-10T21:05:40  <Prillicy> logging off for movies and code
2011-02-10T21:05:43  <antimatroid1> i've always been a fan of flexibility, most of what i read no one ever sees anyway
2011-02-10T21:05:47  <Frontier> me too. that was a good idea in python. away with the useless { { { } } }
2011-02-10T21:05:47  <McLeopold> Yes, I like the structure it imposes on me.  I've only have a few wtf due to indentation, so it doesn't really have drawbacks for me.
2011-02-10T21:06:16  <Frontier> Do you have a special key on english keyboards for  { and } ?
2011-02-10T21:06:25  <McLeopold> I find the brackets comforting sometimes. :)
2011-02-10T21:06:34  <antimatroid1> yeah, it's shift [
2011-02-10T21:06:45  <Frontier> that is two keys :)
2011-02-10T21:06:45  <antimatroid1> Frontier; where are you from?
2011-02-10T21:06:51  <McLeopold> what keyboard?
2011-02-10T21:07:02  <Frontier> I have a qwertz keyboard

2011-02-10T21:07:26  <antimatroid1> fuuuuuuu
2011-02-10T21:07:35  <McLeopold> do you have a special key for double s?
2011-02-10T21:07:44  <antimatroid1> do you have a key for backwards d's?
2011-02-10T21:07:54  <Frontier> oh yes we do have one for ß
2011-02-10T21:08:16  <Frontier> What is a backward d? Is that cyrillic?
2011-02-10T21:08:33  <McLeopold> 3 symbols on the number keys?
2011-02-10T21:09:04  <antimatroid1> there was something somewhere (maybe bash?) where someone asked how to do the backwards d
2011-02-10T21:09:11  <antimatroid1> probably a troll, but nevertheless made me laugh
2011-02-10T21:09:46  <Frontier> most number keys have 3 symbols yes. linux introduced a few more codes though

2011-02-10T21:25:44  <antimatroid1> with the current parameters, it's not possible for enemy ants to land on the same square
2011-02-10T21:25:57  <antimatroid1> if the fight radius is below 2 that becomes an issue
2011-02-10T21:25:59  <Frontier> antimatroid: something like a flash

2011-02-10T21:27:12  <antimatroid1> would that direction i just added for colliding ants help?
2011-02-10T21:27:34  <antimatroid1> i don't think you're going to get ant ids sorry, you can try and talk them into it, but i'm not doing the engine
2011-02-10T21:28:09  <antimatroid1> so C would be passed instead of W, and it'd mean fade as walk i guess?

2011-02-10T21:54:04  <Frontier> A sample output from the engine always helps :)
2011-02-10T21:54:18  <antimatroid1> Frontier: i think that is mostly sound, one thing, would you prefer "G" or "go" to indicate the end of input for a turn?
2011-02-10T21:54:42  <Frontier> go
2011-02-10T21:55:34  <antimatroid1> with viewRadius and attackRadius
2011-02-10T21:55:40  <Frontier> and should the ants fade out during the turn that kills them or afterwards?
2011-02-10T21:55:41  <antimatroid1> can take take the number in and sqrt it?
2011-02-10T21:56:02  <antimatroid1> i think mcleopold is doing that with bots
2011-02-10T21:56:15  <antimatroid1> umm... i think during the turn that kills them
2011-02-10T21:56:26  <antimatroid1> is it possible to sort of do it in increments
2011-02-10T21:56:30  <antimatroid1> it's not really smooth then though
2011-02-10T21:56:46  <Frontier> so if turn 1 kills them, they fade out from the start of the game to the second turn
2011-02-10T21:57:06  <antimatroid1> hmmm
2011-02-10T21:57:16  <antimatroid1> i think it's going to need to be "blocky"
2011-02-10T21:57:20  <Frontier> increments could be more fitting with this square theme of the game
2011-02-10T21:57:34  <antimatroid1> i'd say do those 3 parts i outlined
2011-02-10T21:57:40  <Frontier> some 8-bit soundtrack anyone?
2011-02-10T21:57:46  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-02-10T21:58:20  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure what you'll do about making food look different to ants?
2011-02-10T21:58:35  <Frontier> choose a different color
2011-02-10T21:58:51  <antimatroid1> i'd use maybe dark brown and light brown for walls/land, but do whatever you want
2011-02-10T21:59:23  <Frontier> are they walls? or can ants attack through non-walkable tiles?
2011-02-10T21:59:34  <antimatroid1> they can attack through them currently
2011-02-10T21:59:45  <Frontier> so what about water?
2011-02-10T21:59:50  <antimatroid1> yeah okay
2011-02-10T22:00:01  <antimatroid1> although they aren't really large patches
2011-02-10T22:00:11  <antimatroid1> and they can be diagonal?
2011-02-10T22:00:39  <Frontier> diagonal? can you explain that to me. the game is on a square grid
2011-02-10T22:00:49  <antimatroid1> %.
2011-02-10T22:00:49  <antimatroid1> .%
2011-02-10T22:01:00  <antimatroid1> wouldn't look like water is really folowing between those squares
2011-02-10T22:01:02  <antimatroid1> puddles?
2011-02-10T22:01:52  <antimatroid1> go with water for the moment
2011-02-10T22:02:01  <antimatroid1> it does make more sense with attacking like that
2011-02-10T22:04:36  <Frontier> oh, i can probably do it in reverse of the walls in the current visualizer
2011-02-10T22:05:30  <Frontier> Currently the land tiles connect in the situation you pictured out. But I can turn it around and draw land on water instead of walls on land
2011-02-10T22:05:47  <antimatroid1> cool :)
2011-02-10T22:06:17  <antimatroid1> i've no idea what size maps are going to be good yet
2011-02-10T22:06:58  <antimatroid1> i can't imagine it'd be above 200 with turn limits needed
2011-02-10T22:07:07  <antimatroid1> and realistically i think 100 is more likely
2011-02-10T22:10:28  <Frontier> That is good to know for the amount of detail I can put into every square
2011-02-10T22:10:50  <Frontier> ... basically none ^^
2011-02-10T22:11:07  <antimatroid1> that's why i posed it as "sliding pixels" :P
2011-02-10T22:11:36  <antimatroid1> is it possible for it to show detail when someone zooms in?
2011-02-10T22:11:49  <antimatroid1> and not after a certain amount out?
2011-02-10T22:12:34  <Frontier> that would be possible, i thought about that. but without ant ids and all the goodies it is a lot of work to restore the current state
2011-02-10T22:13:31  <Frontier> maybe it could be just 2 levels of zoom: fit to screen with no detail and 1:1 with the current level of details
2011-02-10T22:13:49  <antimatroid1> that could work
2011-02-10T22:14:41  <Frontier> And the new ant game still has edge wrapping?
2011-02-10T22:14:53  <antimatroid1> very much yes
2011-02-10T22:15:32  <antimatroid1> it'd be very hard to make a "fair" map for n>4 players without wrapping
2011-02-10T22:37:45  <Frontier> I cannot really imagine games with > 4 players.
2011-02-10T22:37:45  <antimatroid1> Frontier: do you want information in [x][y] or [row][col] format?
2011-02-10T22:38:01  <antimatroid1> why not?
2011-02-10T22:38:05  <antimatroid1> i think it'd be cool
2011-02-10T22:38:07  <Frontier> Just as you like.
2011-02-10T22:38:43  <Frontier> I'd be cool, but ... I don't know it is just a feeling I have that someone sees 4 corners and then 4 players is suddenly the max
2011-02-10T22:38:47  <antimatroid1> i'm going with row,col, as it's superior
2011-02-10T22:39:43  <Frontier> it's just a matter of indexing the tokens when I build the objects from text input

2011-02-10T22:44:46  <antimatroid1> oh, there is no command for Collide ant without moving it
2011-02-10T22:44:58  <antimatroid1> for when something is walking into its square, how do you want that?

2011-02-10T22:55:57  <Frontier> That should cover every corner case
2011-02-10T22:56:15  <antimatroid1> cool
2011-02-10T22:56:40  <Frontier> You could also omit the direction and I take that as a default value of 'no direction'
2011-02-10T22:56:56  <Frontier> but X is fine
2011-02-10T22:57:01  <antimatroid1> i just thought of a messed up game that would be lots of fun
2011-02-10T22:57:51  <antimatroid1> not sure how to resolve collisions, but each turn you can fill a square or a line with a colour, and only those squares change to your colour, or you can pick a square of the enemy and it fills outwards into your colour
2011-02-10T22:58:04  <antimatroid1> winner is the player that first fills the grid with their colour
2011-02-10T22:59:36  <Frontier> Isn't that go?
2011-02-10T22:59:42  <antimatroid1> Frontier: whatever you want can be done, so remove the x?
2011-02-10T22:59:47  <antimatroid1> not sure, never really played go
2011-02-10T23:00:08  <antimatroid1> other than ant ids :P
2011-02-10T23:00:14  <antimatroid1> you'd have to ask mcleopold for those
2011-02-10T23:00:27  <Frontier> yeah remove it, that is my vengence for no ant ids
2011-02-10T23:01:48  <Frontier> how is the visibility calculated? you said something about sqrt
2011-02-10T23:02:07  <antimatroid1> the parameter passed is vision^2
2011-02-10T23:02:12  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: is that right?
2011-02-10T23:02:52  <Frontier> and what metric is used?
2011-02-10T23:02:56  <antimatroid1> euclidean
2011-02-10T23:03:20  <Frontier> was that the 'normal' one?
2011-02-10T23:03:37  <antimatroid1> yeah, length of the line between them
2011-02-10T23:04:15  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/uMUiwQtG
2011-02-10T23:04:16  <Frontier> so 4 becomes 2, and the ant can see 2 squares ahead if no rounding errors occur
2011-02-10T23:04:19  <antimatroid1> that's my edist function
2011-02-10T23:04:25  <antimatroid1> that's correct
2011-02-10T23:04:44  <antimatroid1> oh wait, vision is 4 in this example
2011-02-10T23:04:47  <antimatroid1> fight radius is 2
2011-02-10T23:05:03  <antimatroid1> but vision radius is going to be ~9.6 i think
2011-02-10T23:05:09  <antimatroid1> i just used that because it's a smaller map
2011-02-10T23:06:02  <Frontier> then I wouldn't sqrt in the end and just use the squared distance to compare it with the squared viewDistance
2011-02-10T23:06:18  <Frontier> that was the intention i think
2011-02-10T23:06:23  <antimatroid1> probably
2011-02-10T23:06:35  <Frontier> i did that sometimes in my code
2011-02-10T23:06:38  <antimatroid1> i've just been making lots of functions for testing atm, i'll clean them up later

2011-02-10T23:18:25  <antimatroid1> do you want me to throw out 'I' and 'M'? they're fairly redundant?
2011-02-10T23:18:58  <Frontier> That were the ones I was wondering about, yeah. But how nit-picky am I? :/
2011-02-10T23:19:18  <antimatroid1> can't be worse than i
2011-02-10T23:20:01  <antimatroid1> done
2011-02-10T23:20:19  <Frontier> cool
2011-02-10T23:20:46  <Frontier> how about a data version as the first number, just in case?
2011-02-10T23:21:12  <antimatroid1> I still you mean?
2011-02-10T23:21:19  <Frontier> so if we decide to change something the visualizer can still display both formats
2011-02-10T23:21:50  <antimatroid1> or like mcleopold's P parameterType value?
2011-02-10T23:22:23  <Frontier> That is more important for the bot<->server communication, but it couldn't harm
2011-02-10T23:22:23  <McLeopold> for the maps, there is no 'D' or 'M' anymore, just a block of ascii
2011-02-10T23:23:04  <McLeopold> 2 formats?
2011-02-10T23:23:15  <McLeopold> what are the 2 formats
2011-02-10T23:23:36  <antimatroid1> Frontier: what if i use the same parameter format as bot input for the visualiser?
2011-02-10T23:23:57  <Frontier> McLeopold: I mean, if the format evolves in the next weeks the visualizer can see that the version number changed and get it right
2011-02-10T23:24:19  <antimatroid1> Frontier: check etherpad
2011-02-10T23:24:37  <antimatroid1> I think you'd want map lines to have M again then?
2011-02-10T23:24:49  <Frontier> what line?
2011-02-10T23:25:02  <antimatroid1> where you get visualiser input parameters
2011-02-10T23:25:37  <McLeopold> hmm, yeah
2011-02-10T23:25:55  <antimatroid1> 96
2011-02-10T23:25:56  <antimatroid1> sorry
2011-02-10T23:26:13  <Frontier> ok, that looks good to me. can i still haz "P version 1" ?
2011-02-10T23:26:36  <Frontier> everyone has versions in their formats
2011-02-10T23:26:46  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2011-02-10T23:26:58  <antimatroid1> P all noPlayers width etc.?
2011-02-10T23:27:21  <Frontier> no, one parameter each line is fine
2011-02-10T23:27:51  <antimatroid1> ahh, okay
2011-02-10T23:28:44  <McLeopold> I think I'm screwing up the fonts
2011-02-10T23:29:24  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: you're just playing well :P
2011-02-10T23:29:33  <antimatroid1> it would be fun to have "fights" on that
2011-02-10T23:29:38  <McLeopold> all I want is monospace!
2011-02-10T23:29:54  <Frontier> the game was called core wars i think
2011-02-10T23:30:00  <McLeopold> oh well, I'll let you fix it
2011-02-10T23:31:47  <antimatroid1> I think that's all fixed up?
2011-02-10T23:31:48  <Frontier> I'll add me a few water squares to the sample and update the visualizer on the weekend
2011-02-10T23:32:05  <antimatroid1> Frontier: I added a "go" between parameter lines and the char map, is that needed?
2011-02-10T23:32:09  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I thought of a solution to the vision issue.
2011-02-10T23:32:20  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: shoot
2011-02-10T23:32:38  <McLeopold> I'll create a matrix at the beginning initialized to 1
2011-02-10T23:33:00  <McLeopold> when an ant is created, I'll increment squares in it's vision by 1
2011-02-10T23:33:11  <Frontier> antimatroid1: That isn't needed.
2011-02-10T23:33:20  <McLeopold> when it moves, there is a small set of about 17 squares to decrement on one side
2011-02-10T23:33:27  <McLeopold> and about 17 to increment on the other
2011-02-10T23:33:48  <McLeopold> then, if the number is > 0, the bot can see it
2011-02-10T23:34:07  <McLeopold> also, I'll have a second matrix for each bot, which I already have
2011-02-10T23:34:34  <McLeopold> if a number goes from 0 to 1, then that flag is set, as in they are seeing the spot for the first time, so send wall info
2011-02-10T23:35:05  <McLeopold> so, I'm maintaining the vision mask throughout the game, and don't need to recalculate it each turn
2011-02-10T23:35:21  <Frontier> thumb up
2011-02-10T23:35:41  <antimatroid1> hmmm, why not just scan out from each players ant each turn and pass information about each square that's seeable? it means you don't need to store any information about who has seen what and people don't need to worry about hashing information of different things and calculating what information they implicitly now have

2011-02-10T23:37:51  <antimatroid1> okay but sure, say you want to walk back to where you saw a resource but lost sight while getting a closer one
2011-02-10T23:38:02  <antimatroid1> it's not straight forward to just say keep track of that square as food unless told otherwise
2011-02-10T23:38:15  <antimatroid1> you need to work out whether you implicitly know it's no longer food and is visible
2011-02-10T23:38:16  <McLeopold> I know, in this scheme, the info disappears
2011-02-10T23:38:26  <McLeopold> You have to write a better bot to try and remember

2011-02-10T23:58:45  <antimatroid1> should we add a parameter to everything for that?
