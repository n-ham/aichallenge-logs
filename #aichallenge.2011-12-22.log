2011-12-22T00:01:29  <analyst74> I think the eventual goal is to cut to 500?
2011-12-22T00:02:24  <BenJackson> something like that
2011-12-22T00:02:26  <BenJackson> at 3k now
2011-12-22T00:02:50  <analyst74> ya, I wonder what's the cutting schedule is like
2011-12-22T00:04:05  <BenJackson> several hours ago it was 12 hours until 2k cut
2011-12-22T00:05:18  <analyst74> I think the sigma will converge around 60ish games, if my memory is right
2011-12-22T00:05:34  <analyst74> to 1.30, after that, it's just re-arranging leaderboard
2011-12-22T00:07:13  <analyst74> unless all your bot do is winning, thus have sigma drop slower, but I think only one bot has that problem
2011-12-22T00:07:27  <UncleVasya> amstan: thank you guys for your efforts to get more servers. I didn't expect such increasing in finals.
2011-12-22T00:10:35  <Westicles> I'm a little surprised how bad I'm doing... was at 266 with 45 games when finals started, now 673 after 39 games
2011-12-22T00:10:44  <analyst74> You're welcome, UncleVasya. your pleasure is my goal.
2011-12-22T00:10:54  <analyst74> I'm not amstan, but I'm sure that's what he'll say
2011-12-22T00:11:09  <UncleVasya> heheh :)
2011-12-22T00:12:03  <BenJackson> Westicles: before finals there was a clear ladder of people to climb
2011-12-22T00:12:13  <BenJackson> bots with solid rankings that you could be tested against
2011-12-22T00:12:27  <BenJackson> even at the top it's messy
2011-12-22T00:12:43  <BenJackson> ChrisH and pguillory were ranked quite low and I was 4th until I had a game with both (!) of them
2011-12-22T00:12:45  <Accoun> http://tcpants.com/player/Accoun20101 play with it please
2011-12-22T00:12:47  <analyst74> ya, I see a lot of names I'm unfamiliar with at the top
2011-12-22T00:12:50  <BenJackson> and that jumped them up and me down
2011-12-22T00:13:07  <BenJackson> but if 2/3 of us had been properly ranked to begin with the 3rd could have moved in withotu any disruption
2011-12-22T00:13:37  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, there's a lot of churn to move the top bots up to the top
2011-12-22T00:13:59  <Accoun> http://tcpants.com/player/Accoun20101 play with it please
2011-12-22T00:14:22  <Westicles> BenJackson:  yeah.  I'm not sure which number is more accurate.
2011-12-22T00:14:48  <BenJackson> probably the former
2011-12-22T00:14:53  <BenJackson> BUT if your bot is inconsistent
2011-12-22T00:15:06  <BenJackson> you could get stuck in a bubble for a while
2011-12-22T00:15:25  <Westicles> Well, it certainly isn't much of a program
2011-12-22T00:16:02  <amstan> analyst74: you make a convincing amstan
2011-12-22T00:17:12  <analyst74> ya, I have been told I'm good at impersonation

2011-12-22T00:28:03  <BenJackson> that's kind of a bummer
2011-12-22T00:28:11  <BenJackson> I'd prefer a contest of ideas over just implementations
2011-12-22T00:28:29  <BenJackson> his combat is probably better but I stuck with my original because I thought that was more interesting
2011-12-22T00:28:35  <analyst74> ya, me too
2011-12-22T00:28:49  <analyst74> I stuck with my minimax-based idea that never materialized

2011-12-22T00:51:33  <xyxan> yeah i liked this gmae :D
2011-12-22T00:52:00  <analyst74> yes, I can see that, from your intense typing
2011-12-22T00:52:30  <xyxan> what abt you :)
2011-12-22T00:52:41  <analyst74> of cuorse!
2011-12-22T00:53:00  <xyxan> When is there gonna be next competition!!
2011-12-22T00:53:27  <analyst74> don't worry, the excitement will wear off before next one begins. :)
2011-12-22T00:54:08  <BenJackson> I missed tron (didn't hear about it) and PW as a game didn't inspire me
2011-12-22T00:54:09  <xyxan> Infact i started late :P and now i m around 680 :) kinda good for me :P
2011-12-22T00:54:27  <analyst74> After competing in the 2nd one, I skipped the 3rd, to be safe in other fronts of life. :p
2011-12-22T00:54:56  <xyxan> BenJackson any ideas about next competition?
2011-12-22T00:55:02  <BenJackson> there are several in the forum
2011-12-22T00:55:18  <BenJackson> if it's asteroids/thrust/xpilot/gravitar I'd be in for sure
2011-12-22T00:55:27  <BenJackson> but I think that would set the bar very high for newcomers
2011-12-22T00:55:43  <analyst74> I'm hoping it involves more strategy
2011-12-22T00:56:01  <xyxan> humm, any idea about next game start?
2011-12-22T00:56:02  <BenJackson> I once spent as long as this entire contest getting an xpilot bot to do pathfinding and fly through a real map
2011-12-22T00:56:05  <BenJackson> at high speed
2011-12-22T00:56:33  <BenJackson> but that was awesome to see
2011-12-22T00:56:49  <analyst74> ya, more complex combat is definitely going to make it dramatically harder
2011-12-22T00:57:15  <analyst74> I remember there was an indy space fighter (squad-based, AI-assisted) game
2011-12-22T00:57:17  <xyxan> I liked taking challenges :) never had achance to code like this :)
2011-12-22T00:57:29  <BenJackson> turn based games are all going to be alpha-beta + optimizations and heuristics
2011-12-22T00:57:45  <analyst74> where you can choose to use torpedo (hit harder, but more difficult to aim) or self-directed missiles (hits lighter, but fire and forget)
2011-12-22T00:58:57  <analyst74> ya, deeper strategy will make the game more diversed, but the ranking will be even harder to settle

2011-12-22T05:49:43  <janzert> next cutoff goes to 2000 and expected to start in ~20-30 minutes
2011-12-22T05:51:51  <bretep> How does the cutoff work? As in what happens in the time the pairing cutoff goes down?
2011-12-22T05:53:59  <janzert> bretep: not sure what you mean? The cutoff is always at a specific point. I just adjust it in steps over a time period when making changes to make it a little smoother. The pairing during that time is done from whatever it happens to be when each matchup is made.
2011-12-22T05:56:01  <janzert> and by I adjust, I mean there is a script that does it for me ;)
2011-12-22T05:56:12  <bretep> Ah, ok. I thought there might be some kind of mechanism to give the ants in that range a last chance to get back into the pairing cutoff, like something like a bubble sort.
2011-12-22T05:57:19  <Kettling> Hey another suggestion is to allow people to request grudge matches.  I just want to beat datachomper because he works at Digium.  After dealing with Asterisk's SIP engine I deserve a bit of comeuppance

2011-12-22T06:00:18  <janzert> they couldn't count for ranking though or it opens up rank manipulation problems

2011-12-22T06:23:01  <janzert> no :)
2011-12-22T06:23:29  <janzert> probably at the most 500 maybe 250 but unlikely possibly not beyond 1000

2011-12-22T08:19:05  <flowenol> at first i was afraid the deadline was too short, but seeing the ranks getting stable makes me think it would be enough after all
2011-12-22T08:19:37  <flowenol> janzert after 2000 the cut goes to 1000?
2011-12-22T08:20:13  <Antimatroid> BenJackson back at 10th
2011-12-22T08:20:47  <Antimatroid> They're still changing quite a bit ATM
2011-12-22T08:21:22  <flowenol> yea but i would be happy if the contest ended right now
2011-12-22T08:21:28  <janzert> I really enjoy the arimaa book because it's not just about learning arimaa, every other chapter is about history of computer game playing and related topics
2011-12-22T08:21:34  <janzert> flowenol: yes
2011-12-22T08:21:57  <dmj111> janzert: ok... twist my arm!
2011-12-22T08:22:38  <flowenol> btw will there be a cut above 500? So i know more or less when my bot will be cut
2011-12-22T08:22:41  <janzert> :)
2011-12-22T08:22:47  <flowenol> or is there no decision on that
2011-12-22T08:23:02  <janzert> there is still the possibility of going to 250 but no decision still
2011-12-22T08:23:15  <flowenol> (or just cut it while it is first place in portugal :D)
2011-12-22T08:23:37  <janzert> actually going below 500 starts to create technical difficulties with pairing
2011-12-22T08:23:46  <flowenol> ah i see
2011-12-22T08:24:11  <flowenol> though i think it would be interesting to see the top100 for a while and then 50
2011-12-22T08:24:28  <flowenol> well that means 36h of stress for me

2011-12-22T08:30:28  <janzert> back on finals timeout stats, as before http://pastebin.com/mfizZavf first query is overall, second is players with >20 games, also here it is for the current top 2000 players http://pastebin.com/KB4FdDPf
2011-12-22T08:30:33  <Accoun> im beter than a1k0n http://tcpants.com/ranking
2011-12-22T08:31:09  <Surya> How does the cutoff works basically?
2011-12-22T08:31:31  <Surya> (please don't give me the link to a 10k lines script :p)
2011-12-22T08:31:37  <janzert> only players ranked better than the cutoff are considered when pairing a game
2011-12-22T08:32:03  <janzert> pretty simple  I think :)
2011-12-22T08:32:07  <Surya> And why is the cutoff progressive and not direct if it works this way?
2011-12-22T08:32:43  <Surya> I mean, to go from 3k towards 2k takes a while, and I was wondering why
2011-12-22T08:32:43  <janzert> just to give a smooth transition, if I understand your question correctly
2011-12-22T08:32:58  <Surya> yeah, I think you did :) Thx for the answer
2011-12-22T08:36:06  <bearoff_w> Accoun,  why do you repeat this? Do you steal and modify a1k0n code slightly to has "a bot better than a1c0n"?

2011-12-22T13:07:00  * flowenol scrolls up
2011-12-22T13:07:23  <flowenol> at least at 1000
2011-12-22T13:07:30  <Scryer> Thanks.
2011-12-22T13:07:46  <flowenol> there is no confirmation about lower values
2011-12-22T13:07:59  <flowenol> but it may be possible
2011-12-22T13:08:07  <bretep> Well, likely it'll end at 500
2011-12-22T13:08:26  <bretep> [12:23] <janzert> probably at the most 500 maybe 250 but unlikely possibly not beyond 1000  [12:23] <janzert> but also less likely than 500
2011-12-22T13:08:28  <flowenol> bretep yes according do janzert below that there may be pairing problems
2011-12-22T13:08:46  <Scryer> OK, nice.
2011-12-22T13:08:48  <bretep> Below 500 there might be a pairing problem iirc
2011-12-22T13:09:14  <flowenol> yup
2011-12-22T13:09:35  <teapotahedron_ko> Belerafon_L: well, our 19th version also placed around 10th place =)

2011-12-22T13:10:46  <Scryer> It makes a big difference to have over 40 servers running.  Back when there were like 10 or 12 it seemed like a week would have been pretty dodgy.

2011-12-22T13:12:00  <teapotahedron_ko> the last change that improved  the performance was that we didn't correctly calculate the upper bound of amonts of time that we spend on fighting

2011-12-22T13:12:40  <flowenol> tomb___ it would be interesting

2011-12-22T13:15:42  <flowenol> i just dont know how well
2011-12-22T13:16:10  <Scryer> Indeed - lots of emergent behavior.  Maybe the TCP servers should try it afterwards. Mine doesn't hard-code, but I've never tested it with anything other than the standard values.

2011-12-22T13:40:56  <Murashka> GreenTea What was an idea? To kill borning ants on multi hill maps?
2011-12-22T13:41:31  <GreenTea> yes, it was introduced by some men on forum
2011-12-22T13:41:49  <GreenTea> *man
2011-12-22T13:42:19  <Frib> haha someone in my latest game timed out exactly on turn 1000, giving away his first place by losing 2 points from his remaining hills
2011-12-22T13:44:00  <Scryer> Murashka - if you control one of two hills, you drain off half the enemy ants. This would also mess up ChrisH's clever new algorithms for choosing where to spawn, as well as the people who save lots of ants for a final siege.
2011-12-22T13:45:01  <bretep> I don't think it's a good idea in any case to have a load of ants saved in your hill.

2011-12-22T13:52:00  <janzert> @later tell McLeopold the map checker is using a max where it should have been using a min on line 569 of map.py. There are some maps that violate the specs because of this. My opinion though is that the finals have run so long without it being noticed that they should just be left in place now
2011-12-22T13:52:00  <contestbot> janzert: Ready to serve, my lord.

2011-12-22T13:59:56  <dmj111> Cowbandit: i imagine it will be several months at least until they do another contest.
2011-12-22T14:00:10  <Cowbandit> blah
2011-12-22T14:00:13  <bretep> Nope, Cowbandit. I wouldn't expect a new contest before march
2011-12-22T14:00:26  <flowenol> so a spring edition maybe
2011-12-22T14:00:36  <Cowbandit> lol ok hopefully
2011-12-22T14:00:46  <flowenol> i hope i dont hear about it

2011-12-22T14:02:13  <flowenol> do it with bf or malbolge
2011-12-22T14:02:32  <Cowbandit> were there any ant bots programmed with lolcode?
2011-12-22T14:02:39  <flowenol> no

2011-12-22T14:02:51  <flowenol> i can haz stdio?

2011-12-22T14:03:36  <flowenol> Murashka if it will be i feel sorry for whoever writes it

2011-12-22T14:05:14  <flowenol> precisely
2011-12-22T14:05:37  <flowenol> for next if i participate ill go with C++
2011-12-22T14:05:45  <flowenol> possibly c++11
2011-12-22T14:06:10  <Scryer> Glancing at the leaderboard, looks like Java's good enough, though. It's all about the algorithms.

2011-12-22T14:06:32  <analyst74> I suffered from the speed of CPython too, but I *believe* knowing how to write C module for python would remedy that
2011-12-22T14:06:33  <bretep> The main peformance issue is the coder :v
2011-12-22T14:06:38  <flowenol> i always loved C and C++, I just went java because i have spent my last year and a half coding java, so it is more fresh

2011-12-22T14:07:07  <Garf> there seemed to be very few top entries using pypy...which suggests the python coders used numpy or C
2011-12-22T14:07:20  <Cowbandit> does it ever get confusing knowing multiple languages?

2011-12-22T14:09:01  <flowenol> python is nice but I hate the fact that indentation defines scope
2011-12-22T14:09:22  <flowenol> love the {}
2011-12-22T14:09:32  <dmj111> lots of people hate that, but it turns into a feature.

2011-12-22T14:09:34  <bretep> I like the indentation
2011-12-22T14:09:43  <pairofdice> indentation is less typing than {}

2011-12-22T14:16:01  <analyst74> too many choices

2011-12-22T14:17:08  <flowenol> i think ill try pycharm, and probably stick with it

2011-12-22T14:23:44  <Scryer> analyst74 - Totaalnet's contribution made a huge difference!
2011-12-22T14:24:08  <analyst74> GreenTea, huge map with far away hills reward late game strength
2011-12-22T14:24:22  <pairofdice> reward fast expansion
2011-12-22T14:24:30  <rebelxt> +1 totaalnet helped so much
2011-12-22T14:25:10  <analyst74> yes Scryer, it did! except it was too late for me to take advantage of that. :(
2011-12-22T14:27:35  <bearoff_w> are Totaalnet servers used now?
2011-12-22T14:30:04  <Scryer> That's my impression.
2011-12-22T14:30:35  <Belerafon_L> I think all servers more 4 is totaalnet
2011-12-22T14:31:21  <rebelxt> 42 servers running games is very cool: http://aichallenge.org/server_stats.php

2011-12-22T14:36:10  <Scryer> Antimony - I pulled the maps from https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/maps with GIT when I was doing my local Scryer Marathon testing. I'm not sure these are precisely what's being used, but that's my first guess.

2011-12-22T14:47:27  <BenJackson> lots of games have ties that would be broken easily in a few hundred turns
2011-12-22T14:47:41  <BenJackson> and sometimes that's doubled with people getting cheap points off of weaker neighbors

2011-12-22T14:49:16  <tomb___> i hate random walks too.  mostly because i get left with no defense fairly easily.
2011-12-22T14:49:23  <Scryer> Ugh! I thought my ninja code was working brilliantly, but I needed "timed out ants" code also. I sit on the lip of a hill for 200+ turns before somebody else harvested it. http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=323938&user=8246

2011-12-22T15:18:57  <Murashka> yes it's not so boring now :)
2011-12-22T15:18:59  <rebelxt> _flag: hoping for 500 or 250 cutoff later tonight or tomorrow
2011-12-22T15:19:21  <_flag> Personally I think the top 100 or so bots should get at least 100 games
2011-12-22T15:19:44  <Murashka> Someone promised 200 earlier
2011-12-22T15:19:53  <_flag> At this point one good and potentially lucky game from anyone in around 4-10 could jump them several places
2011-12-22T15:19:55  <itzkow> if the cutoff will be more strict they can do even more than 100
2011-12-22T15:20:08  <teapotahedron_ni> itzkow: we are 3

2011-12-22T15:20:14  <_flag> So if the difference between places is a single game then the contest loses some of its integrity
2011-12-22T15:20:17  <_flag> IMO
2011-12-22T15:20:40  <itzkow> thats a close race though
2011-12-22T15:20:50  <rebelxt> _flag: i feel top100 bots will have 100+ games even with 1K cutoff. but 250-300 games is much better
2011-12-22T15:21:02  <itzkow> I believe with many bots its hard to say whos better
2011-12-22T15:21:09  <_flag> rebelxt: Well the contest ends tommorow right?
2011-12-22T15:21:18  <rebelxt> yep. 29 more hours
2011-12-22T15:21:47  <_flag> So if we expect hundreds of games the game rate has to speed up pretty soon
2011-12-22T15:22:16  <itzkow> even with 200 games, the last games will always have more value
2011-12-22T15:22:39  <itzkow> so if you win your last 5 games with luck you can get really higher than your true rating
2011-12-22T15:23:00  <Zaphus> janzert: did you improve the DB code so that you can run more servers ?  I thought that was the limiting factor but it looks like you've added more since then
2011-12-22T15:23:01  <_flag> One of the big problems is so much depends on your starting position
2011-12-22T15:23:13  <_flag> So xathis ends up coming dead last in some games despite not playing the worst
2011-12-22T15:23:38  <_flag> And since the same is true for everyone else, sigmas are high and nobody knows what the true rankings are
2011-12-22T15:23:53  <rebelxt> itzkow: yep, this is true even after 200+ games

2011-12-22T15:24:37  <itzkow> but luck gives this game extra excitement :)
2011-12-22T15:24:57  <Zaphus> _flag: I wonder if there some calculation that can be done that would detect when it's impossible for the result of a single game to change the top 10 order (i.e. assume they all play each other, and try all combinations of winning and see if any lets someone move) - once that condition is met you could say it was stable (or do it for 5 games)
2011-12-22T15:25:25  <Murashka> _flag map, neighbours, position...luck...it's casino
2011-12-22T15:25:54  <_flag> Zaphus: I like this idea, but you would have to apply it only for games containing players inside the top 100 or so, because if xathis loses to a starter pack it's hard to see him not moving anywhere :)
2011-12-22T15:26:26  <analyst74> even with top 100 is a lot of variability
2011-12-22T15:26:29  <Zaphus> _flag, yes it would need to be chosen 'well' - but its theoretically possible
2011-12-22T15:26:50  <_flag> McLeopold, janzert: What do you think of Zaphus' idea for ending the contest?
2011-12-22T15:27:15  <analyst74> @seen McLeopold
2011-12-22T15:27:15  <contestbot> analyst74: McLeopold was last seen in #aichallenge 19 hours, 2 minutes, and 51 seconds ago: <McLeopold> basically, if 2 bots' actual mu is a low and a high
2011-12-22T15:27:21  <Zaphus> _flag of course that condition could possibly never get met :-)
2011-12-22T15:28:18  <Murashka> _flag bad idea. Current result depends of last map serie.
2011-12-22T15:28:29  <janzert> yeah, the advantages of a specific time for scheduling pretty much over ride the others

2011-12-22T15:33:03  <janzert> every contest so far, only the very 1st spot or 2 were actually known with any real certainty by the ranking system
2011-12-22T15:33:09  <rebelxt> Zaphus: lol, i'm not far from you
2011-12-22T15:33:43  <janzert> btw, in any human tournament of almost any kind you don't usually even get that :/
2011-12-22T15:33:46  <kateb> were certain because these were paid and hardcoded ;-) ha ha ha ha
2011-12-22T15:34:03  <rebelxt> it seems that 200+ games is guaranteed if cutoff is lowered to 500 or 250 some time tonight
2011-12-22T15:34:17  <analyst74> certainty is overrated!
2011-12-22T15:34:18  <_flag> janzert: Fair point, but human tournaments have a human element to take into account (fatigue, etc.)
2011-12-22T15:34:19  <Zaphus> _flag:  Right at the end, run the top 10 bots through all permutaitions of 2..10 across all maps - they all play everyone, they all start in each starting place, they all play every map  (it's actually one of my test cases I used at home)
2011-12-22T15:34:32  <analyst74> wait until we have stochaistic game next contest :p
2011-12-22T15:34:50  <_flag> janzert: What do you think of Zaphus' top few cutoff idea?
2011-12-22T15:34:52  <janzert> any go or chess computer tournament as well
2011-12-22T15:35:10  <_flag> Chess games take hours
2011-12-22T15:35:12  <rebelxt> _flag: didn't you code human element? my bot gets tired the longer the game goes, and it normally gives up if losing. feels like a human to me
2011-12-22T15:35:31  <Zaphus> _flag: hey, stop making me the bad guy :-)  I'm just blabbing on with ideas, I don't actually want them implemented :-)
2011-12-22T15:35:34  <kateb> _flag: chess can take the same amount of time as ants
2011-12-22T15:35:39  <TL_> _flag: bullet time tournament can be played in chess
2011-12-22T15:35:46  <_flag> rebelxt: My bot seems to get worse with time, so I may have thrown it in accidentally
2011-12-22T15:35:50  <_flag> Zaphus: sorry :9
2011-12-22T15:35:55  <Zaphus> lol
2011-12-22T15:35:57  <rebelxt> ;-)
2011-12-22T15:36:04  <janzert> btw, lowering the cutoff much below 500 would have to lower the game rate to match for the pairing system to keep up so wouldn't give the bots any more games

2011-12-22T15:37:30  <kateb> _flag: you can say the same with ants, it can take a few minutes for every round, if you want to analize the whole battlefield
2011-12-22T15:37:46  <kateb> so it can take days for one game
2011-12-22T15:38:05  <_flag> kateb: That's not the time contraints given by the contest; if it was I would understand
2011-12-22T15:39:50  <kateb> well, I dont know much about current chess tournaments, but for a contest we can add a time limit rule easily ;-)
2011-12-22T15:40:23  <Zaphus> Next contest:  one giant map, 8,000 bots at the same time, last one standing wins :-)
2011-12-22T15:40:51  <_flag> Zaphus: Just one game :), winner takes al
2011-12-22T15:40:58  <_flag> all*
2011-12-22T15:41:06  <janzert> _flag: the only thing we could do is stop playing games early if some condition was met, but that seems less than useful
2011-12-22T15:41:10  <kateb> what about hill location permutations
2011-12-22T15:41:14  <rebelxt> Zaphus: World War III ?

2011-12-22T15:41:32  <janzert> the contest can't go beyond the deadline, since we have to have a time scheduled for everyone to show up at

2011-12-22T15:47:51  <pairofdice> lazarant seems to be very good at 1v1
2011-12-22T15:48:10  <pairofdice> Maybe it's just noise but...
2011-12-22T15:48:18  <flowenol> im only good with maps with hills rather away from each other
2011-12-22T15:48:25  <flowenol> too close are certain death
2011-12-22T15:48:30  <tomb___> question, is there anything in the matching algorithm that ensures some kind of distribution of map type?
2011-12-22T15:48:41  <pairofdice> My bot is equally dumb in any map
2011-12-22T15:48:59  <tomb___> i suuuuuuuck at 1v1
2011-12-22T15:49:03  <Murashka> it's just xathis don't like random_walk_p02_xx
2011-12-22T15:49:03  <Antimatroid> I don't think so
2011-12-22T15:49:30  <janzert> tomb___: yes, IIRC it tries to evenly play the players on all maps and even the maps out for the games in a day
2011-12-22T15:49:41  <Antimatroid> At this rate teapotahedron might win
2011-12-22T15:49:55  <Antimatroid> I kind of hope Cathie keeps the win at this point
2011-12-22T15:50:05  <Antimatroid> Even though I'd prefer c++ to win
2011-12-22T15:50:08  <tomb___> oh nice
2011-12-22T15:50:31  <Antimatroid> Xathis*
2011-12-22T15:51:26  <tomb___> so i gather that the matching algorithm is processing lots of data or dealing with slow db queries or something.  i have heard some kind of a paper mentioned.  what is called or can anyone link to it
2011-12-22T15:51:36  <tomb___> i am curious
2011-12-22T15:51:45  <xathis> Antimatroid: it's very unlikely i can hold first place, my mu keeps falling and teapotahedron keeps rising
2011-12-22T15:52:20  * Murashka still bets on xathis
2011-12-22T15:52:30  <_flag> This contest has been kind of interesting, because I think some players tend to play better against better players, as weird as that sounds

2011-12-22T15:54:25  <Antimatroid> Xathis* well I'm rooting for you and flag I hope you go back up a bit
2011-12-22T15:55:06  <Antimatroid> Although your performance is still pretty amazing given your age :)
2011-12-22T15:55:27  <xathis> my mu was at 98.3 and now is at
2011-12-22T15:55:28  <xathis> 94.7, if this goes on i won't even end up second
2011-12-22T15:55:35  <Murashka> _flag for example GarySWest can beat xathis but he will never will play with him from 99 place
2011-12-22T15:56:40  <_flag> Murashka: Yes, but I (for example) can beat xathis from wherever I've ended up now and I'm not as good as him
2011-12-22T15:56:50  <Antimatroid> There's only so many games we can give crap bots against Cathie
2011-12-22T15:57:15  <Antimatroid> Otherwise you end up with torn like matching, and then I invite you to go watch some of those games :p
2011-12-22T15:57:20  <_flag> My point is that some players tend to exploit the strategies of higher level players more easily, for example by being more agressive
2011-12-22T15:57:48  <_flag> xathis: Out of curiousity, does your bot tend to be more passive until it knows it has secured a lead?

2011-12-22T16:00:01  <Antimatroid> Xathis* do you feel like it's the maps that is causing this or teapotahedron has just gotten a lot better or both?
2011-12-22T16:00:15  <Murashka> _flag it depends of map and position. If you beat him on all maps from all positions i think you are better. Also bots can use different tactics in one on one and in free for all maps.
2011-12-22T16:00:40  <xathis> i guess he's just better
2011-12-22T16:01:07  <Antimatroid> There are a few two player maps, but I haven't seen anything like half which is good
2011-12-22T16:01:19  <Antimatroid> I'm quite anxious about that screw up
2011-12-22T16:01:31  <xathis> but yeah, i suck at 2player random maps. i should have included my code from the beta when there were no hills and use that when detecting those maps :D
2011-12-22T16:02:00  <Antimatroid> Sorry, iPad changes xathis to Cathie

2011-12-22T16:02:32  <_flag> Murashka: I know, but I'm thinking that certain bots preform at different levels based on the quality of their opponents; not intentionally, but because their particular strategy happens to be the correct underlying strategy in a top-bot situation, but not in a lower-bot situation
2011-12-22T16:02:34  <flowenol> eww ipad

2011-12-22T16:03:12  <Migi32> I think we should just let the cutoff keep going down, all the way to 2, so you there can be like 1000 games between the #1 and #2 bot :)
2011-12-22T16:03:18  <Migi32> then we know for sure :)

2011-12-22T16:09:23  <_flag> xathis: You still won this thing in my eyes :)
2011-12-22T16:09:25  <TL_> the bots suddenly became stronger the last week before the finals as everyone tends to implement better combat as described in the forums.

2011-12-22T16:19:10  <Migi32> btw I think I know now what caused the new version of my bot to be significantly weaker than my old version: I added code to keep ants together. This meant less ninja hill snipes, and it forms big frontlines that block everything.µ

2011-12-22T16:41:31  <Surya> ok ty
2011-12-22T16:41:35  <Migi32> cutoff is 1601
2011-12-22T16:41:38  <Antimatroid> 4-10 is still tightly contested
2011-12-22T16:41:45  <a1k0n> no kidding

2011-12-22T16:42:11  <analyst74> winning 1 game could jump you 5 places

2011-12-22T16:44:22  <a1k0n> at least 7897 people were interested at some point
2011-12-22T16:45:00  <Surya> yeah! Try to imagine my situation: My colleague is supposed to be the good programmer in my company.

2011-12-22T16:54:25  <cseyu01> does anybody's bot give the map an "openness score" and adjust their gathering strategy acordingly?
2011-12-22T16:54:27  <Migi32> but there are lower-ranked bots which do have some actual logic, but time out or crash before they score points

2011-12-22T16:58:12  <Migi32> will sigma actually keep dropping as we play more games? Or will it level off at some point?
2011-12-22T16:58:46  <pairofdice> It will level off at about 1.3
2011-12-22T16:58:49  <Murashka> Migi32 will keep dropping to 1.3 at about 200 games
2011-12-22T16:59:23  <pairofdice> And I think we'll get pretty close to 200 games
2011-12-22T16:59:46  <Surya> Xathis is almost always unlucky when I see his defeats. He picks the wrong direction to explore and don't find food areas. I guess it's part of the game: luck :)

2011-12-22T17:45:02  <pairofdice> So there's hope for a bit of a updraft
2011-12-22T17:45:48  <Antimatroid> I suspect it's more to do with top bots having less people to be matched with
2011-12-22T17:45:58  <Antimatroid> But I could be wrong
2011-12-22T17:46:31  <McLeopold> there's an explaination in there somewhere
2011-12-22T17:46:53  <besh> when you win a multi-player game , is it equivalent to winning each of players in a 2 player game ? Also are points earned relevant for the calculation ?
2011-12-22T17:47:31  <Zannick> points are irrelevant, iirc, only rankings at the end of the game
2011-12-22T17:48:41  <Antimatroid> The scoring system would be way more important otherwise

2011-12-22T17:49:23  <besh> but sometimes you loose by 1 points just because the winner chose to raze your hill and the other participants got lucky.
2011-12-22T17:49:40  <dmj111> Zannick: right.  just the ordering at the end
2011-12-22T17:49:50  <Antimatroid> I beat speedy console too
2011-12-22T17:50:15  <Scryer> The scoring system is very important already - How would changing the value of your hill to be worth as much as somebody else's change your strategy? What if you got credit for the number of ants left, or how long it took you to take a hill?  All very important.
2011-12-22T17:50:24  <Antimatroid> Best: I don't agree with ending games before they've fully stabilized, but it's what was chosen
2011-12-22T17:50:24  <dmj111> besh: yep.   I think that is where it relies on playing lots of games to even those situations out.

2011-12-22T17:57:25  <McLeopold> right

2011-12-22T17:58:11  <besh> I got two 2-player random walk games. Thats new.
2011-12-22T17:58:17  <conor_f> lol
2011-12-22T17:58:30  <conor_f> if everyone played the same number of games, I'd be #1 :P
2011-12-22T17:58:51  <Scryer> Since you're at 1247 now and the pairing cutoff is 1269 and dropping, you'd better win one soon. :)
2011-12-22T17:59:13  <conor_f> ;)
2011-12-22T17:59:14  <conor_f> I know
2011-12-22T17:59:24  <conor_f> I don't really want to play many more games
2011-12-22T17:59:30  <conor_f> I want the game numbers to level up :(
2011-12-22T17:59:40  <Scryer> I was ready to stop the finals after my game 4.  I have the screenshot. :)
2011-12-22T17:59:42  <conor_f> http://aichallenge.org/country_profile.php?country=108
2011-12-22T17:59:43  <GreenTea> game speed is amazing
2011-12-22T17:59:45  <Zannick> oh, the cutoff is shown on the server stats page
2011-12-22T17:59:58  <McLeopold> so, how many people hate me for messing up the final map specs?
2011-12-22T18:00:15  <conor_f> McLeopold: haha, I didn't even know :P
2011-12-22T18:00:16  <Scryer> No harm done to me McL. :)
2011-12-22T18:00:31  <McLeopold> actually, it's all Antimatroid's fault :P
2011-12-22T18:00:54  <janzert> ahh, blame it on me too at least. I specifically remember reading that line and thinking it did the right thing :P
2011-12-22T18:01:11  <Zannick> what went wrong?
2011-12-22T18:01:13  <McLeopold> well, at least the cell_mazes where correct

2011-12-22T18:01:42  <conor_f> with this cutoff point does it not mean that game counts end up making a linear graph with higher ranked people playing more games?
2011-12-22T18:01:44  <McLeopold> so they weren't too bad
2011-12-22T18:02:08  <McLeopold> conor_f: yes, see my earlier pastes
2011-12-22T18:02:11  <_flag> Wait, so what was supposed to be the difference in maps?
2011-12-22T18:02:25  <janzert> conor_f: it's not exactly a clean line, but that is the general idea
2011-12-22T18:02:39  <McLeopold> so, one of the maze maps had 5400 area per player, it should have been rejected
2011-12-22T18:02:42  <conor_f> yeah, ok
2011-12-22T18:02:53  <_flag> Just one?
2011-12-22T18:03:01  <janzert> no
2011-12-22T18:03:07  <McLeopold> I think about 5ish?
2011-12-22T18:03:10  <janzert> no

2011-12-22T18:03:17  <janzert> yes
2011-12-22T18:03:27  <janzert> I stopped counting after about a dozen

2011-12-22T18:03:54  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-12-22T18:04:03  <McLeopold> so, those maps are likely to produce more ties
2011-12-22T18:04:20  <McLeopold> so I only really made things easier for everyone but xathis :P

2011-12-22T18:12:15  <Zannick> hills were added right after the beta ended
2011-12-22T18:12:31  <GreenTea> Surya, maby 0.5 years ago beta started
2011-12-22T18:12:32  <Zannick> as well as the scoring mechanism

2011-12-22T18:12:46  <_flag> I think the only beta players in the top 10 are xathis, me and GreenTea. There were plenty of other beta players who dropped down

2011-12-22T19:27:34  <Migi32> yes! I'm in the top 50 again :)
2011-12-22T19:27:41  <Migi32> let's hope it stays that way
2011-12-22T19:27:59  <a1k0n> Migi32: haha you won with a timeout
2011-12-22T19:28:21  <flowenol> funny all games where i timeout, there has been at least another timeout too, and both of us use java
2011-12-22T19:28:32  <Migi32> hah, true. Didn't notice that yet.
2011-12-22T19:28:38  *** Antimatroid <Antimatroid!3cf04478@gateway/web/freenode/ip.60.240.68.120> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-22T19:28:47  <Antimatroid> Up to 25
2011-12-22T19:29:09  <flowenol> and again
2011-12-22T19:29:13  <flowenol> 2 timeouts both java
2011-12-22T19:29:33  <Migi32> no idea why though, because locally most of my moves end up using less than 300ms, and I've got time-checking loops with like 10ms reserve. And I use C++ so no garbage cleaning issues.
2011-12-22T19:29:44  <Migi32> but it only happens in like 1% of my games so I'm cool with that
2011-12-22T19:29:55  <meduza> a1k0n: well, just a little bit )
2011-12-22T19:29:57  <a1k0n> do you produce a lot of stderr output?
2011-12-22T19:29:57  <Migi32> especially if I win anyway :D
2011-12-22T19:30:04  <Migi32> a1k0n: none
2011-12-22T19:30:09  <a1k0n> odd
2011-12-22T19:30:19  <flowenol> Migi32 java?
2011-12-22T19:30:23  <Migi32> nope, C++
2011-12-22T19:30:24  <a1k0n> the remedy i had for that was to setitimer, so a signal always wakes up my process after 475ms
2011-12-22T19:30:28  <flowenol> really weird
2011-12-22T19:30:48  <Migi32> a1k0n: you can do that? Wish I knew about that :)
2011-12-22T19:31:01  <a1k0n> yeah, it was basically a requirement in tron when a timeout would disqualify you
2011-12-22T19:31:06  <Migi32> but why 475ms instead of 499ms? Is the timer so imprecise?
2011-12-22T19:31:21  <a1k0n> well cuz i still have some work to do to output moves at that point.  i probably could have done 490ms.
2011-12-22T19:31:24  <flowenol> there seems to be some issue when >=2 java bots play against each other
2011-12-22T19:31:38  <analyst74> topcoder looks interesting, is it some form of high-end rent-a-coder platform?
2011-12-22T19:31:45  <flowenol> a1k0n i did 480 works well
2011-12-22T19:31:49  <Antimatroid> I didn't have thT I. Torn and was disqualified
2011-12-22T19:31:54  <Zannick> oh, geez, running two jvms on one machine
2011-12-22T19:31:58  <a1k0n> i did .95 * turntime
2011-12-22T19:32:03  <Migi32> ok. Also, could it perhaps have to do with GC-cycles of the playgame.py script?
2011-12-22T19:32:09  <a1k0n> Zannick: but they both get a core!
2011-12-22T19:32:18  <a1k0n> (who knows how much ram is contested)
2011-12-22T19:32:18  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@barracuda.imagesourceinc.com> has left #aichallenge
2011-12-22T19:32:28  <flowenol> a1k0n but they both timeout :P
2011-12-22T19:32:29  <Zannick> a1k0n: could be the same core!
2011-12-22T19:32:38  <flowenol> i start to blame gc
2011-12-22T19:32:41  <flowenol> and myself
2011-12-22T19:32:49  <flowenol> pick another language next time
2011-12-22T19:32:51  <Zannick> (running 8 players on a 2 core machine does funny things)
2011-12-22T19:33:02  <a1k0n> yeah, but it only sends moves to two of them at a time
2011-12-22T19:33:03  <Migi32> flowenol: they time out on the same turn?
2011-12-22T19:33:04  <Zannick> actually, it's probably just cache thrashing
2011-12-22T19:33:10  <a1k0n> so maybe migrating between cores causes.. yes.
2011-12-22T19:33:30  <Migi32> I don't think that would cause more than a 1ms delay
2011-12-22T19:33:36  <flowenol> Zannick running 8 java bots all equal, running on a 4 core 8 thread cpu result 7 of them timeout
2011-12-22T19:33:42  <flowenol> Migi32 nope
2011-12-22T19:33:45  <flowenol> different turns
2011-12-22T19:34:00  <Zannick> can't imagine why that makes java unhappy only with multiple java bots
2011-12-22T19:34:09  <flowenol> idk
2011-12-22T19:34:12  <flowenol> memory maybe
2011-12-22T19:34:20  <flowenol> java has some fame of being ram hungry
2011-12-22T19:34:41  <flowenol> my bot uses around 400/500mb
2011-12-22T19:34:43  <Migi32> well yeah, if there's page thrashing, then that could definitely cause timeouts
2011-12-22T19:35:24  <conor_f> none of them problems with C/++ ;)
2011-12-22T19:35:37  <Antimatroid> My bot is on a roll
2011-12-22T19:35:46  <flowenol> thats why next time ill send java to the trash can
2011-12-22T19:35:58  <conor_f> :) thats the way to go flowenol
2011-12-22T19:36:08  <Migi32> conor_f: too few RAM affects every programming language :) but all the other things shouldn't.
2011-12-22T19:36:09  <Antimatroid> Go for go
2011-12-22T19:36:15  <Antimatroid> I might try out go
2011-12-22T19:36:34  <Migi32> isn't go also garbage collected?
2011-12-22T19:36:36  <flowenol> Antimatroid i got interested in it too
2011-12-22T19:36:48  <flowenol> i like non gc langs
2011-12-22T19:36:50  <thestinger> Migi32: yes
2011-12-22T19:36:54  <meduza> flowenol:  java is not soooo bad
2011-12-22T19:36:58  <conor_f> I think that if you think about your implementation enough, it shouldn't matter what language its in
2011-12-22T19:37:08  <flowenol> meduza i always had a small anti java itch
2011-12-22T19:37:14  <Antimatroid> Brainfuck it is then
2011-12-22T19:37:26  <flowenol> but being the language I used for the last year and a half at work

2011-12-22T19:39:07  <flowenol> the jvm may also be the cause

2011-12-22T19:41:36  <flowenol> im still @ java6
2011-12-22T19:41:38  <flowenol> but sun jdk
2011-12-22T19:41:45  <flowenol> the only one trouble free for me
2011-12-22T19:41:49  <meduza> flowenol: i don't believe that gc can last for more than 100 ms per turn
2011-12-22T19:42:05  <flowenol> meduza but it can kill me right at the end
2011-12-22T19:42:20  <flowenol> my combat code stops when i have 20ms remaining
2011-12-22T19:42:28  <QGazQ> My laptop which I used for dev(profiling) is windows and sun, my server which I used for test games is linux and openjdk
2011-12-22T19:42:39  <flowenol> if gc triggers there and takes some more ms im dead
2011-12-22T19:42:59  <flowenol> even my server has sun
2011-12-22T19:43:04  <meduza> flowenol: 20ms maybe not enough
2011-12-22T19:43:23  <flowenol> according to my benchmarks it was
2011-12-22T19:43:34  <QGazQ> According to mine is wasn't
2011-12-22T19:43:47  <QGazQ> Before I had pools the gc was taking 100ms+
2011-12-22T19:43:56  <meduza> flowenol: local benchmarks but not server ones
2011-12-22T19:43:59  <QGazQ> With them it took less, but still ~50ms sometimes
2011-12-22T19:44:05  <flowenol> all it had to do was output the ants in combat
2011-12-22T19:44:10  <QGazQ> And yes as you say thats on my HW
2011-12-22T19:44:13  <flowenol> meduza yep, cant benchmark on the server
2011-12-22T19:44:55  <flowenol> basically pre-competition i counted the timeouts
2011-12-22T19:45:06  <flowenol> only had one with the version in combat atm
2011-12-22T19:45:14  <QGazQ> Shame, we should all get shell accounts on the server and be able to play :P

2011-12-22T20:16:38  <BenJackson> the matchmaker keeps putting me in big games that you'd think would sort it out, but the stalemates/neighbor factor is making them useless for sorting

2011-12-22T20:17:39  <BenJackson> if asteroids is too complex I was wondering if something more like "defender" would work
2011-12-22T20:17:48  <j3camero> I will check em out. Maybe whip up some prototype game replays.
2011-12-22T20:17:51  <a1k0n> are we considering continuous-time games?
2011-12-22T20:18:04  <a1k0n> cuz that's pretty tricky to get right
2011-12-22T20:18:07  <j3camero> Anything is on the table, I should think.

2011-12-22T20:18:38  <j3camero> a1k0n were you thinking of some continuous time game in particular?

2011-12-22T20:18:58  <Antimatroid> I don't think we can achieve our goals wrt beginners and a continuous game
2011-12-22T20:19:12  <BenJackson> ants wasn't truly that accessible to beginners
2011-12-22T20:19:14  <BenJackson> combat was tough
2011-12-22T20:19:16  <a1k0n> yeah, that's kind of my feeling but maybe it's not that hard
2011-12-22T20:19:25  <BenJackson> sadly someone spelled out combat during the contest
2011-12-22T20:19:34  <a1k0n> when your move is received by the server, you start going that way
2011-12-22T20:19:41  <j3camero> Antimatroid: I'm not going to say it's impossible. But taking a game with continuous space or time and making it into discrete space or time is a good way to put it within more peoples reach.
2011-12-22T20:19:52  <BenJackson> a1k0n: well let's say it's 5fps or something, so you get 200ms to make a "move"
2011-12-22T20:19:54  <Zannick> i was awhile ago trying to think of how to make a good racing game for aichallenge
2011-12-22T20:20:27  <a1k0n> could work
2011-12-22T20:20:28  <Zannick> but i couldn't quite figure out how to make it fair
2011-12-22T20:20:31  <j3camero> Racing would be neat and super competitive.
2011-12-22T20:20:38  <a1k0n> yeah.  and probably require calculus

2011-12-22T20:20:49  <j3camero> a1k0n probably right.
2011-12-22T20:20:56  <analyst74> it's always hard to be in top 20, but you don't have to get everything right to be somewhat competitive
2011-12-22T20:20:58  <Antimatroid> Calculus is easy

2011-12-22T20:24:10  <BenJackson> janzert: is it possible to put links (say to source) in profile?  when I edit it has html in it (<br>) but if I use html it gets escaped
2011-12-22T20:24:50  <Migi32> <BenJackson> "ants wasn't truly that accessible to beginners, combat was tough" <- not really true. I know some people in real life who made some relatively simple bots (ranked #2000 or so) and they still had tons of fun. They just ignored combat.
2011-12-22T20:25:23  <BenJackson> Migi32: ok but asteroids might be in the same way
2011-12-22T20:25:27  <j3camero> Yeah I thought ants would be frustrating for beginners, but the turnout was still higher than previous contests.
2011-12-22T20:25:32  <BenJackson> the determinism/turn-basedness of ants helps though
2011-12-22T20:25:38  <thestinger> I didn't really find basic combat very hard
2011-12-22T20:25:53  <thestinger> the other parts like exploration and efficient movement were harder
2011-12-22T20:26:11  <j3camero> What about Risk? Or a simplified Risk so the rules are not hard to learn.

2011-12-22T20:26:18  <thestinger> to get basic combat you just had to implement a battle resolution function, and the python code for it was available
2011-12-22T20:27:03  <thestinger> if you were doing it like memetix without just sampling moves, it was probably a lot harder to figure out
2011-12-22T20:28:29  <thestinger> j3camero: diplomacy :)

2011-12-22T20:28:52  <j3camero> Oh I have played Diplomacy. So much fun!
2011-12-22T20:28:54  <thestinger> would be awesome to have interaction with other players, having to form alliances, etc.
2011-12-22T20:29:12  <j3camero> Maybe the ability to send arbitrary strings to other players?
2011-12-22T20:29:36  <Scryer> j3camero - Risk is great. I have a very distinguished board: my wife and I played Jimi Hendrix with it.
2011-12-22T20:29:36  <Migi32> that would be interesting, but what the hell will bots send to each other though? just strings? I don't think people would really try to interpret other bot's messages
2011-12-22T20:30:02  <thestinger> I think the engine could just have some premade requests - you just need to be able to form alliances for something simple
2011-12-22T20:30:07  <thestinger> a request and then a way to accept/reject
2011-12-22T20:30:49  <thestinger> arbitrary strings makes it too biased towards people on irc
2011-12-22T20:31:10  <j3camero> Yeah the arbitrary strings would just be a fun thing for the power users
2011-12-22T20:31:22  <j3camero> So they could pass really complex messages about their intentions

2011-12-22T20:33:12  <Migi32> strings would just be gibberish to other bots, except when people who know each other collaborate by sending their bots' name to the other bots and not attacking the bots of their friends
2011-12-22T20:33:38  <thestinger> yeah, the engine would need to provide a way to send specific types of messages
2011-12-22T20:35:18  <Migi32> but to be honest I would rather not have a FFA game, but a 1v1 type game. Because in FFA, how good your bot does depends on your opponents. For example, you can die because one of your opponents was stupid.

2011-12-22T20:36:33  <Migi32> it's not so noticable at the lower levels but half of xathis's losses were just because he was basically fighting 2v1
2011-12-22T20:36:40  <Scryer> I think if it had been all 1v1 this time it would have been boring.

2011-12-22T20:37:55  <Migi32> and this 2v1 can be triggered by having a better bot that expands faster than everyone else etc
2011-12-22T20:38:24  <BenJackson> thestinger: I think there are way too many mazes
2011-12-22T20:38:30  <thestinger> BenJackson: yes!
2011-12-22T20:38:33  <thestinger> I hate the mazes :P
2011-12-22T20:38:34  <BenJackson> I thought mazes had sort of been phased out
2011-12-22T20:38:48  <Scryer> Seems to me there are more options for strategic thought if you have more than two -- figuring out you can use enough to defend against one while attacking against another.
2011-12-22T20:39:09  <QGazQ> I love mazes, it helps other ants not find me, they are bad, they kill me
2011-12-22T20:39:14  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, I assumed most of the maps would be cell mazes, random walks and maybe amstan's cave maps
2011-12-22T20:39:45  <thestinger> oh well :P
2011-12-22T20:40:18  <BenJackson> plus there's a much higher proportion of maps where the hills are concentrated and the food is on the side
2011-12-22T20:40:26  <BenJackson> I am not optimized at all for that case

2011-12-22T20:52:16  <Scryer> Wonder if we could have used local CUDA farms to tune some of the magic constants.
2011-12-22T20:52:38  <Migi32> Scryer: you used CUDA for your bot?
2011-12-22T20:52:49  <Migi32> doesn't that require a completely different way of programming or something?
2011-12-22T20:52:53  <Scryer> Nope.
2011-12-22T20:53:13  <Migi32> Scryer: nope to my first or 2nd question? :)
2011-12-22T20:53:29  <Scryer> You can program it in C, but I was thinking running several games simultaneously in the different processors to get an idea of some of the relevant variables.
2011-12-22T20:53:59  <Scryer> I didn't use CUDA - it wouldn't have been legal, even if those boxes had NVIDIA GPUs and were running a supported version of Ubuntu. Which they weren't.
2011-12-22T20:54:20  <Scryer> I was pondering whether it made sense to do local testing with it.
2011-12-22T20:55:30  <Migi32> actually the rules say nothing about using your GPU. But I guess it falls under the "no threads" rule.
2011-12-22T20:55:44  <QGazQ> As I understand this sort of stuff wouldn't lend itself well to running on them
2011-12-22T20:55:57  <BenJackson> I'm sure the EC2 boxes have no interesting gpu
2011-12-22T20:56:10  <QGazQ> they work well when the task can be broke down into lots of little threads which do a specific thing

2011-12-22T21:19:22  <TL_> the rankings in the rank 90 to 110 is still very volatile. i need to win a game badly to avoid going out of the top100
2011-12-22T21:19:56  <teapotahedron_ni> will there be a cutoff?
2011-12-22T21:20:01  <teapotahedron_ni> top100?
2011-12-22T21:20:54  <TL_> until top500 only

2011-12-22T23:12:34  <Scryer> Harsh one.
2011-12-22T23:13:38  <pguillory> a1k0n: grats
2011-12-22T23:13:39  <a1k0n> your ants were like, shuttling food from one hill to the other
2011-12-22T23:13:59  <a1k0n> or rather they were emerging from hills and i can't tell where they go
2011-12-22T23:14:36  <a1k0n> pguillory: for a while i was worried you weren't even in the top 10, but now you're at the top of the heap below flagcapper, heh
2011-12-22T23:14:44  <_flag> That's my exploration system at work :P
2011-12-22T23:14:54  <_flag> a1k0n: For awhile I dropped down to 12th
2011-12-22T23:15:01  <_flag> I went from 3rd to 12th to 4th
2011-12-22T23:15:05  <pguillory> _flag: that's tough, "ants not razing hills" has got be be the least satisfying conclusion to a game in general
2011-12-22T23:15:14  <_flag> Crazy ranking system at work :)
2011-12-22T23:15:22  <a1k0n> my exploration system seems to have catastrophically failed in that game
2011-12-22T23:15:28  <_flag> pguillory: Yup, but it's entirely my fault so I can't complain to much
2011-12-22T23:15:39  <_flag> The worst is when you are about to raze a hill but it doesn't let you anyway
2011-12-22T23:15:43  <a1k0n> it's almost not fair how close we were there
2011-12-22T23:15:55  <a1k0n> did the maze generator fail to account for distance through the wrap?
2011-12-22T23:16:49  <_flag> a1k0n: I've seen several maps I like that, I think it's intentional to add variety
2011-12-22T23:17:19  <a1k0n> variety aka noise
2011-12-22T23:17:33  <_flag> Yeah that one basically comes out as noise

2011-12-22T23:20:43  <a1k0n> yeah.  but that other one, like, starter bots will get kills on
2011-12-22T23:21:50  <_flag> My biggest problem with that map is your result entirely depends on who you spawn beside
2011-12-22T23:22:04  <Scryer> GreenTea started to do his hostage trick around move 264 in http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=330014&user=398 but gave up on it after a few turns.

2011-12-22T23:23:12  <_flag> Ants seems to be popular for timeouts
2011-12-22T23:23:28  <_flag> Which is probably why I spent a third of my development time optimizing
2011-12-22T23:23:57  <BenJackson> yeah, but there's no way that was really a timeout
2011-12-22T23:24:06  <_flag> How do you know?
2011-12-22T23:24:20  <BenJackson> well I can run the input through my bot but no way at 95 ants
2011-12-22T23:24:29  <Scryer> There's not all that many ants there, though, they're nearly all in combat. Are they broken up in groups, or is that one big front getting optimized?

2011-12-22T23:24:59  <_flag> Yes, but it could be a server load spike, do you check every section of your code against the clock?
2011-12-22T23:25:17  <BenJackson> I don't check any
2011-12-22T23:25:36  <BenJackson> if you're not running it doesn't matter what your timeout code is
2011-12-22T23:28:35  <BenJackson> it would have been the most computationally intensive turn of that game

2011-12-22T23:37:14  <Scryer> thestinger - maybe red's time overflow code ("do this if nearly out of time") is kicking in inappropriately... overflowed using too few bits for nanoseconds or something.

2011-12-22T23:53:30  <Scryer> You were danged close to the cutoff. You could theoretically get back in if enough people at the bottom of the 1000 lose badly enough to get dumped past you, but chances are you can declare success now.
2011-12-22T23:54:14  <BenJackson> the difficulty with getting back in is that sigmas of the top 1000 are going down
2011-12-22T23:54:50  <Scryer> The chance would be pretty good if you were at 1002.
