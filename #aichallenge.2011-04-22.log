2011-04-22T02:44:01  <sigh> janzert: ascii on my system says it is DLE
2011-04-22T02:44:45  <sigh> ascii 0x10
2011-04-22T02:44:45  <sigh> ASCII 1/0 is decimal 016, hex 10, octal 020, bits 00010000: called ^P, DLE
2011-04-22T02:44:47  <sigh> Official name: Data Link Escape
2011-04-22T02:45:01  <sigh> the first line is the command I ran
2011-04-22T02:46:17  <janzert> yeah, I see that a few other places now as well. two examples that list it as backspace are http://www.asciitable.com and http://bestofthisweb.com/blogs/tag/ascii-table/
2011-04-22T02:46:50  <janzert> although it looks like the second is just a rip off of the first
2011-04-22T02:47:07  <sigh> backspace is 010
2011-04-22T02:47:12  <sigh> those sites get it right

2011-04-22T02:47:35  <janzert> oops, yeah I was looking at the octal column
2011-04-22T02:49:59  <sigh> I wonder why it forced a download... I think it's the browser's fault, not apache
2011-04-22T02:50:27  <janzert> must trigger binary file handling?
2011-04-22T02:50:37  <sigh> yeah
2011-04-22T02:51:10  <sigh> (HTTP response headers for the borked log file was the same as the other files back before it was fixed, which is why I don't think it is apache)

2011-04-22T02:55:24  <sigh> bah... if I serves the logs to myself with "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" it thinks all the logs are binary files
2011-04-22T02:55:50  <janzert> wrong mime type in the headers?
2011-04-22T02:56:44  <sigh> yeah, application/octet-stream
2011-04-22T02:57:27  <jaycobcoleman> I believe a DLE needs to be terminated by another command
2011-04-22T02:57:41  <sigh> what does it actually do?
2011-04-22T02:57:53  <jaycobcoleman> Interprets everything following as raw data
2011-04-22T02:58:33  <janzert> http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/ascii-characters.html#data
2011-04-22T02:59:25  <sigh> yeah... I've been reading that
2011-04-22T02:59:42  <sigh> never seen it before, I wonder what uses it
2011-04-22T02:59:59  <janzert> it sounds to me like not much of anything ever used it
2011-04-22T03:00:09  <jaycobcoleman> does this mean that I somehow managed to type three plus signs in a row?
2011-04-22T03:00:17  <janzert> no
2011-04-22T03:00:27  <sigh> nah, three plus signs are safe
2011-04-22T03:00:28  <sigh> ++
2011-04-22T03:00:30  <sigh> +++
2011-04-22T03:00:40  <janzert> hayes modems used the three plus signs instead of the DLE character
2011-04-22T03:01:12  <janzert> (well, with silence before and after)
2011-04-22T03:01:39  <jaycobcoleman> Ah yes I see
2011-04-22T03:01:58  <jaycobcoleman> So then it is command p that's the worry?
2011-04-22T03:02:19  <sigh> ^P is just the way it is rendered in plain text
2011-04-22T03:02:43  <jaycobcoleman> gotcha
2011-04-22T03:03:24  <janzert> it's a byte with just the 4th bit set ;)
2011-04-22T03:03:45  <janzert> I have a feeling that any wierd control code probably triggers the browser to treat it as binary data
2011-04-22T03:04:05  <jaycobcoleman> well this was a strange and informative incident. Sorry to anyone I caused problems for : )

2011-04-22T04:37:54  <Stocha> is there any tutorial for how the server stuff works ? what has been implemented already ? what is still in work. Question for begining to thing about a tcp server
2011-04-22T04:49:20  <jaycobcoleman> There's no up-to-date info on server setup
2011-04-22T04:58:54  <jaycobcoleman> What aspects are you looking for help with? because I believe simply running server_setup.py on a clean ubuntu install works at this point
2011-04-22T04:59:08  <jaycobcoleman> for setup, obviously
2011-04-22T05:00:15  <jaycobcoleman> but if you're looking for tutorials on what to do once you've gotten that then I think you're out of luck
2011-04-22T05:03:41  <Stocha> What i would like is way for n bot to get a ranking and put it on a web page.
2011-04-22T05:03:54  <Stocha> incremental update would be best.
2011-04-22T05:04:19  <Stocha> then i could try to specify a way to furnish the bot set from distant bots through tcp means.
2011-04-22T05:04:30  <Stocha> but i have to have the local server working properly first.
2011-04-22T05:04:40  <Stocha> so i have to know if it already exists i guess :p
2011-04-22T05:04:45  <Stocha> and they learn to set it up.
2011-04-22T05:04:48  <Stocha> then
2011-04-22T05:05:58  <Stocha> i need to know what exists so far. maybe i 'll have a look at server_setup.py when i have time. But if you tell me how it works ?
2011-04-22T05:10:24  <Stocha> The idea is to have a local server than can rank all bot from a local bot set. Then i will make it so that that a local bot can in fact call through tcp a distant bot.
2011-04-22T05:10:38  <Stocha> and also log the games
2011-04-22T05:17:20  <jaycobcoleman> well if you want real answers then Janzert is the man you wanna talk to
2011-04-22T05:19:41  <jaycobcoleman> I would tell you what I do know, but actually janzert just updated the packages a few days ago and it's well documented enough that I think it'd be relatively straight-forward for you to understand what's going on
2011-04-22T05:22:10  <Stocha> i'll try to have a look if / when i have time then.
2011-04-22T05:23:23  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: I think I have a very simple and elegant solution for the problem of dead ants overwriting food info from the same turn
2011-04-22T05:23:45  <sigh> don't display dead ants on the map?
2011-04-22T05:24:24  <jaycobcoleman> well there's an option. really why was it setup to do that in the first place?
2011-04-22T05:24:40  <sigh> dunno, ask mcleopold
2011-04-22T05:25:01  <sigh> the slightly more effort way is to place the food after the dead ants
2011-04-22T05:25:11  <sigh> but really, there is no reason to mark dead ants on the map
2011-04-22T05:26:56  <jaycobcoleman> yes indeed, nonetheless I think right before the end of the render_changes function in the ants.py that runs the game we should just insert visible_updates.sort()
2011-04-22T05:27:45  <jaycobcoleman> It would get rid of the need for a parsing system, which should make updates run slightly faster
2011-04-22T05:31:23  <sigh> sure, but it's not so good to make the bots rely on the particular order that the engine sends out updates
2011-04-22T05:31:36  <sigh> unless that is made part of the specs
2011-04-22T05:31:54  <sigh> especially when there is no real need to mark dead ants on the map
2011-04-22T05:33:28  <jaycobcoleman> they wouldn't rely on it. The current setup would still work, only it would allow for a more efficient system to be used in its place
2011-04-22T05:33:54  <jaycobcoleman> and wether or not you care about marking dead ants, it will speed up updates, which is very important
2011-04-22T05:34:55  <sigh> why would it speed up updates?
2011-04-22T05:35:57  <jaycobcoleman> it would require less testing of each input to see which method should be followed
2011-04-22T05:36:59  <sigh> the updates are already grouped by type
2011-04-22T05:37:39  <sigh> but the bots should not be relying on that
2011-04-22T05:38:18  <sigh> currently, the engine DOES sort, but the order is explictly ants, food, dead ants... dead ants is last because it is the least important
2011-04-22T05:38:45  <sigh> this can be changed BUT, making the order part of the specs is overly restrictive

2011-04-22T05:39:22  <sigh> if it isn't part of the specs the bots should not be relying on it
2011-04-22T05:39:40  <sigh> I'm happy to change the engine if there is some consensus on this though
2011-04-22T05:39:48  <jaycobcoleman> what specs are you referring to?
2011-04-22T05:41:10  <sigh> well, currently it is on the wiki... but the point is that if your bot is relying on it then it should have some guarantee that it will always work that way
2011-04-22T05:41:17  <Stocha> concensus about droping dead ants ?
2011-04-22T05:41:51  <Stocha> what about dead ants only marked when there is no food/ no ant that have been there ?
2011-04-22T05:41:52  <sigh> currently the only reason the engine sorts is to ensure deterministic output
2011-04-22T05:42:05  <sigh> Stocha: you can do that, but why?
2011-04-22T05:42:23  <Stocha> i though it would simplify. maybe i didn't get the problem
2011-04-22T05:42:37  <sigh> incomplete infomation like that is next to useless
2011-04-22T05:42:47  <Stocha> yeah but dead ant seems useless
2011-04-22T05:42:51  <jaycobcoleman> In it's current state, the updating method, at least in the python bot, is already restrictive to the extent that basically any changes to it will result in it no longer working
2011-04-22T05:43:04  <Stocha> except maybe if an ant dies at the limit of the vision radius
2011-04-22T05:43:08  <sigh> dead ants is useful, because there is no other way to track ants properly
2011-04-22T05:43:10  <jaycobcoleman> That's because the input recieved is so restrictive
2011-04-22T05:43:10  <Stocha> wich means it wasn't killed by you.
2011-04-22T05:43:36  <Stocha> usefull for bots ?
2011-04-22T05:44:11  <Stocha> the thing with dead ant for bot, is that it can be deduced, except in the limit cases above stated.
2011-04-22T05:44:12  <jaycobcoleman> If somebody is planning on making a bot they're pretty much going to have to rely on our pre-made updating functions anyway, so I think we might as well make them as fast as possible
2011-04-22T05:44:18  <sigh> jaycobcoleman: the only restrictions are those detailed in the specifications
2011-04-22T05:44:34  <Stocha> how do they take jaycobcoleman ?
2011-04-22T05:44:46  <Stocha> if it's less than 10ms, then it's probably no big deal.
2011-04-22T05:44:57  <Stocha> if it's higher then i agree.
2011-04-22T05:45:08  <woudshoo`> I ignored dead ants, but now I noticed I like the info.  When I look at my bot and you don't have dead ant information, it is sometimes hard to see what happened
2011-04-22T05:45:10  <Stocha> how long do they take
2011-04-22T05:45:47  <Stocha> you mean you think building the dead status from scratch is too demanding ?
2011-04-22T05:45:49  <jaycobcoleman> I haven't timed it, but I'd like to be able to use the same sytem for a large variety of maps
2011-04-22T05:46:13  <sigh> jaycobcoleman: fast as possible is not the goal, if someone wants fast as possible (1) they shouldn't be using python, and (2) they will need to rewrite the starter pack anyway
2011-04-22T05:46:14  <Stocha> i guess i just don't get what the discussion is really about :p
2011-04-22T05:46:37  <sigh> and you are looking at an area of the code which will never ever be a bottleneck
2011-04-22T05:46:57  <sigh> if you want to improve the speed then work on the vision algorithm
2011-04-22T05:46:58  <jaycobcoleman> haha, I think using python probably is a reason to try to make what you're doing as fast as possible
2011-04-22T05:47:17  <jaycobcoleman> What's wrong with it?
2011-04-22T05:47:32  <jaycobcoleman> just slow?
2011-04-22T05:47:36  <sigh> well, the current one is broken :)
2011-04-22T05:47:43  <sigh> in the python starter bot
2011-04-22T05:48:09  <sigh> the one in the engine is fast and works, but will NOT be put into the starter bot because it is complicated
2011-04-22T05:48:09  <jaycobcoleman> It works perfectly, the problem is with parsing at setup
2011-04-22T05:48:34  <sigh> are you taking about vision?
2011-04-22T05:48:43  <jaycobcoleman> yes
2011-04-22T05:48:56  <sigh> it is broken
2011-04-22T05:49:06  <jaycobcoleman> does it return all false or do you get an error of some sort?
2011-04-22T05:49:35  <sigh> no, it returns results which are slightly wrong
2011-04-22T05:49:44  <sigh> hang on, I'll pull up an example
2011-04-22T05:49:58  <jaycobcoleman> that'd be lovely
2011-04-22T05:49:59  <woudshoo`> Stocha: No, it is just that you can't see which move an enemy made just before it died.  When watching replays (with my own visualizing thingy) this is really puzzling sometimes.
2011-04-22T05:50:36  <sigh> jaycobcoleman: http://pastebin.com/gscdvw3u
2011-04-22T05:52:56  <sigh> and parsing is never going to be a bottleneck, there is absolutely no reason to worry about optimising it for the starter pack
2011-04-22T05:53:18  <sigh> main issue atm is correctness, so let's get that right :P
2011-04-22T05:53:27  <jaycobcoleman> Alright, well then moving onto this issue : )  I can't see why that would happen.
2011-04-22T05:53:41  <jaycobcoleman> however, I would like to use numpy arrays for a couple of reasons
2011-04-22T05:53:53  <sigh> sure, you can use whatever you like
2011-04-22T05:53:59  <jaycobcoleman> they're simpler to see created
2011-04-22T05:54:02  <sigh> but it won't be part of he starter pack :)
2011-04-22T05:54:07  <jaycobcoleman> Why
2011-04-22T05:55:03  <jaycobcoleman> they're much simpler to understand for someone who isn't great with programming
2011-04-22T05:55:21  <sigh> maybe, but then they have to install numpy
2011-04-22T05:55:37  <sigh> the fewer dependencies the better for a starter pack
2011-04-22T05:55:49  <jaycobcoleman> numpy has been standard for a while I thought
2011-04-22T05:56:08  <sigh> numpy doesn't come with python
2011-04-22T05:56:40  <jaycobcoleman> hmm. It's weird that I already had it then, on a 2 week old install of Ubuntu

2011-04-22T06:00:26  <jaycobcoleman> that's unfortunate though
2011-04-22T06:01:02  <jaycobcoleman> the ability to call indexes in tuple form would make the code a lot simpler to understand
2011-04-22T06:03:20  <sigh> *shrug* dunno... numpy is not part of python standard library
2011-04-22T06:03:23  <sigh> anything further about starter packs, tell McLeopold :P
2011-04-22T06:03:48  <Stocha> woudshoo: good point
2011-04-22T06:04:06  <jaycobcoleman> alright. I haven't run into any odd vision problems like that though and I can't see any reason for it to happen
2011-04-22T06:04:48  <sigh> jaycobcoleman: the problems are small enough that you generally won't notice unless you explictly test for it
2011-04-22T06:05:25  <jaycobcoleman> alright I'll run some test then
2011-04-22T06:06:04  <sigh> the canonical failure case is when two ants are diagonal each other
2011-04-22T06:06:40  <sigh> there's already a script ants/util/vision_compare.py to test still stuff
2011-04-22T06:07:32  <jaycobcoleman> oh wait, I understand exactly what's happening. Alright, I'm gonna mess with it for a little bit
2011-04-22T06:08:38  <sigh> jaycobcoleman: if you are looking at vision algorithms then have a look at ants/util/vision_compare.py
2011-04-22T06:09:12  <sigh> vision_by_ants_faster is the fastest for a python bot
2011-04-22T06:10:09  <sigh> engine uses an algorithm which is even faster, but it can't be implemented by bots in the general case
2011-04-22T06:11:14  <jaycobcoleman> Oh I see. This is lovely
2011-04-22T06:12:45  <jaycobcoleman> if the not portion of "if (not vision[n_row][n_col] and self.vision_distance(a_loc, n_loc) <= self.viewradius2):" is removed from vision_by_square then it should work perfectly
2011-04-22T06:13:13  <jaycobcoleman> without getting weird diagonals problems

2011-04-22T06:21:05  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: vision_by_ant_faster is the fastest you have so far?
2011-04-22T06:21:36  <sigh> for a bot yeah... engine is faster though
2011-04-22T06:21:57  <jaycobcoleman> So I've been told :P
2011-04-22T06:22:09  <sigh> technically the bot can be made even fast by doing a hybrid with what the engine is doing
2011-04-22T06:23:25  <sigh> either vision_by_ant or a non-cached version of it should go in the starter pack

2011-04-22T06:29:45  <jaycobcoleman> it's just an abstract sort of idea at the moment, but I think it would be very fast to create a small array just large enough to fit the entire view radius of one ant into it, then specify a row/col offset for each element to be placed(of course based on the position of the ant)
2011-04-22T06:30:30  <jaycobcoleman> each turn you create a False array and for each ant compare the two using bitwise & and restoring it as the main map
2011-04-22T06:31:11  <jaycobcoleman> it's like drawing a picture and then pasting it everywhere you want it
2011-04-22T06:31:44  <sigh> stocha was doing/trying something like that
2011-04-22T06:32:09  <jaycobcoleman> was he successful?
2011-04-22T06:33:20  <jaycobcoleman> Stocha: sigh says you had an idea similar to mine for vision. How has that turned out?
2011-04-22T06:33:32  <sigh> dunno, but either way that approach is much more suited to a language like c
2011-04-22T06:33:40  <jaycobcoleman> Why is that?
2011-04-22T06:34:14  <sigh> are you packing each cell as a bit?

2011-04-22T06:35:50  <sigh> no reason, just hat the overhead in python doesn't seem worth it... but try it out and see
2011-04-22T06:36:26  <jaycobcoleman> psyco should speed an operation like that up almost to c standards
2011-04-22T06:36:43  <sigh> try it and see how it goes

2011-04-22T06:42:29  <antimatroid> i meant generally not specifically, but it's alright, i was just making sure you weren't saying you don't understand why some things work better in some langauges than others :P

2011-04-22T06:58:59  <Stocha> well my vision algorithm is okay. i didn't time it or anything.
2011-04-22T06:59:17  <Stocha> nor did i try to optimize it.
2011-04-22T06:59:49  <Stocha> but it uses the parallel capacity of 64 int bit logic.
2011-04-22T07:00:03  <Stocha> int 64 bit logic.
2011-04-22T07:00:40  <Stocha> I draw the view radius from every ant at the same time.
2011-04-22T07:01:00  <jaycobcoleman> Hmm. I don't think we're doing the same thing
2011-04-22T07:01:39  <jaycobcoleman> but you should compare it to the other methods in util/vision_compare.py
2011-04-22T07:02:01  <antimatroid> Stocha: be careful doing that for vision
2011-04-22T07:02:08  <antimatroid> it gets hairy with the euclidean metric

2011-04-22T07:02:38  <Stocha> (unless vision somehow becomes time crititical, but there are few chances at this point)
2011-04-22T07:03:08  <Stocha> antimatroid: ?

2011-04-22T07:03:55  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: okay, so what you're doing in vision_by_ant _faster is almost exactly what I was talking about with the exception that I'm caching the entire overlay as an array so I can do it more quickly per ant.
2011-04-22T07:04:00  <antimatroid> sure okay
2011-04-22T07:04:00  <Stocha> i didn't dare to optimized. Although you can calculate x2 y2 incrementally.
2011-04-22T07:04:11  <antimatroid> why are you using x and y?
2011-04-22T07:04:16  <jaycobcoleman> You probably already figured that out, but I hadn't looked through your methods yet
2011-04-22T07:04:20  <antimatroid> use row and col, or you will just confuse the hell out of yourself
2011-04-22T07:04:25  <Stocha> i say x, y doesn't really matter how you call them.
2011-04-22T07:04:31  <jaycobcoleman> hehe
2011-04-22T07:04:39  <jaycobcoleman> you about to get yelled at
2011-04-22T07:04:44  <antimatroid> x implied indexing of the horizontal dimension
2011-04-22T07:04:45  <Stocha> i agree row and col are better for specifications though.
2011-04-22T07:05:05  <Stocha> i don't agree that it is better for quick prototyping :p
2011-04-22T07:05:19  <sigh> antimatroid: just turn your monitor on its side :P
2011-04-22T07:05:19  <antimatroid> transposing stuff is painful and unecessary
2011-04-22T07:05:29  <Stocha> i don't transpose
2011-04-22T07:05:37  <antimatroid> sigh: for making moves you need to transpose directions
2011-04-22T07:05:42  <Stocha> i use x for what you call col. and y for what you call row
2011-04-22T07:05:49  <antimatroid> and then you need to worry about where you do and don't need to convert
2011-04-22T07:06:02  <antimatroid> Stocha: that's just even less clear to someone reading your code :P
2011-04-22T07:06:06  <Stocha> i never need to convert anything. I always use the same.
2011-04-22T07:06:15  <antimatroid> actually, that's what one would expect
2011-04-22T07:06:20  <Stocha> so fare nobody is supposed to have read the code.
2011-04-22T07:06:21  <antimatroid> but my above statements still stand
2011-04-22T07:06:48  <Stocha> it's still to be proven that row and cols are unambiguous
2011-04-22T07:06:57  <antimatroid> unambiguous?
2011-04-22T07:07:03  <Stocha> what about arabian developper ?
2011-04-22T07:07:24  <antimatroid> the contest is done in english
2011-04-22T07:08:24  <Stocha> x, y are clear to some. i always use top to bottome and left to right directions.
2011-04-22T07:09:03  <Stocha> because it was the coor system that was used on the early MacOs systems.
2011-04-22T07:09:17  <Stocha> when i learned about programming. in 1980's

2011-04-22T07:34:44  <jaycobcoleman> again...
2011-04-22T07:34:45  <amstan> i never undestood one thing, can i do cds in cron lines?
2011-04-22T07:34:57  <amstan> like, how would i go adding a git commit to a cronjob
2011-04-22T07:35:14  <skynetz> you can use at
2011-04-22T07:35:43  <skynetz> instead of cron, unless you want it to execute every single time and not only once
2011-04-22T07:35:58  <skynetz> otherwise just make a script that does the git commit,cds etc.
2011-04-22T07:35:59  <sigh> amstan: just specify the full path
2011-04-22T07:36:03  <skynetz> and point cron to it
2011-04-22T07:36:03  <amstan> i want it to do every single time
2011-04-22T07:36:04  <skynetz> or that
2011-04-22T07:36:04  <sigh> why do you need to cd?
2011-04-22T07:36:22  <amstan> sigh: i don't think i can tell git add where the repo path is
2011-04-22T07:38:02  <sigh> amstan: hmm... you are right
2011-04-22T07:38:57  <woudshoo`> what about git --git-dir=... ??

2011-04-22T08:01:29  <Stocha> how to run a tchat bot contest.
2011-04-22T08:01:41  <Stocha> that would be fun. but hard to get a metric for.
2011-04-22T08:03:23  <sigh> amstan: that url doesn't exist?

2011-04-22T08:06:47  <sigh> yeah... no worries, although you are mentioning it right on the page which is good :)
2011-04-22T08:09:21  <amstan> hmm.. i should probably restart my server to reload the new software..
2011-04-22T08:09:25  <amstan> on the other hand... uptime
2011-04-22T08:09:29  <jaycobcoleman> Where do you live amstan?
2011-04-22T08:09:38  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: near toronto/canada
2011-04-22T08:09:54  <jaycobcoleman> ahh makes sense. We share a time zone :)
2011-04-22T08:12:41  <amstan> sigh: any ideas on the CI system, should i get a VM for that?
2011-04-22T08:12:53  <sigh> CI system?
2011-04-22T08:16:06  <amstan> the countinous integration system for the contest
2011-04-22T08:16:13  <amstan> a place where we can test the new code
2011-04-22T08:18:27  <sigh> oh right, yeah a vm seems like it's best... not sure how else you would do it
2011-04-22T08:18:35  <sigh> not like you want to dedicate a server to it
2011-04-22T08:19:31  <amstan> i was just thinking if there's a way to not use a vm
2011-04-22T08:19:37  <amstan> and just do it on a separate user or something
2011-04-22T08:19:41  <amstan> but it seems like it isn't
2011-04-22T08:20:15  <sigh> your setup pretty much takes over the server, yeah?
2011-04-22T08:21:08  <amstan> well.. i use the server for other stuff too
2011-04-22T08:21:14  <amstan> and yes.. janzert's setup takes over
2011-04-22T08:21:36  <sigh> see if janzert has any ideas then :)
2011-04-22T08:24:50  <amstan> contestbot: seen janzert

2011-04-22T14:47:55  <amstan> virtualbox needs x

2011-04-22T16:00:37  <janzert> try apt-get install python
2011-04-22T16:00:49  <janzert> I had that problem earlier with a fresh chroot install as well
2011-04-22T16:01:12  <amstan> janzert: i already have python
2011-04-22T16:01:23  <amstan> getopt works fine in a small python interactive shell
2011-04-22T16:01:25  <amstan> wait..
2011-04-22T16:01:27  * janzert doesn't understand why modern desktop/server distros split up the python standard lib so much

2011-04-22T16:01:59  <janzert> it's a stdlib module but the minimal python install on ubuntu doesn't seem to include it
2011-04-22T16:02:12  <janzert> so even though python is there the whole stdlib isn't
2011-04-22T16:02:27  <amstan> the python package is installed though
2011-04-22T16:02:33  <amstan> also.. i'm using 11.04 beta 2
2011-04-22T16:02:42  <janzert> hmm :(
2011-04-22T16:04:10  <janzert> could try the python-dev package but I wouldn't think it would have got stuck in there
2011-04-22T16:04:23  <janzert> or wait...
2011-04-22T16:04:32  <amstan> wtf? that line works just fine on its own
2011-04-22T16:04:35  <amstan> in the interpreter
2011-04-22T16:04:39  <janzert> it's not an import error so
2011-04-22T16:04:53  <janzert> the error I was getting earlier was that it couldn't even be imported
2011-04-22T16:05:00  <amstan> janzert: do i have to adduser before i tell it to use that user?
2011-04-22T16:05:03  <amstan> or does it make it?
2011-04-22T16:05:37  <janzert> it needs to be added already, but that shouldn't matter until after all the interactive options have been gathered
2011-04-22T16:08:57  <janzert> hmm, not sure how this is working at all. but add an "import getpass" to the top of install_tools.py
2011-04-22T16:08:58  <amstan> janzert: found the problem..
2011-04-22T16:09:05  <janzert> that should fix your immediate error
2011-04-22T16:09:05  <amstan> install_tools.py doesn't have the import
2011-04-22T16:09:12  <janzert> right :)
2011-04-22T16:09:47  <janzert> I'll check in a fix along with a bunch of other stuff in a little bit

2011-04-22T16:10:15  <amstan> janzert: does it want mysql already installed?
2011-04-22T16:10:16  <janzert> agh, now I'm going to be in conflict :P
2011-04-22T16:10:23  <janzert> no, it'll do that
2011-04-22T16:10:38  <amstan> it asks me for the db root pass
2011-04-22T16:10:45  <janzert> right, in case it is already installed
2011-04-22T16:10:51  <janzert> otherwise just hit enter
2011-04-22T16:10:54  <janzert> and leave it blank
2011-04-22T16:11:21  <amstan> blank? but then what will the pass be?
2011-04-22T16:11:27  <janzert> blank
2011-04-22T16:11:28  <janzert> :)
2011-04-22T16:11:46  <janzert> that's what is with an automatic install of mysql
2011-04-22T16:12:19  <amstan> janzert: also.. where should i git clone the repo?
2011-04-22T16:12:53  <janzert> /home/contest/aichallenge is the location I've been using
2011-04-22T16:12:57  <amstan> ok
2011-04-22T16:13:09  <janzert> it should be in aichallenge under whatever you set the contest root to
2011-04-22T16:14:12  <janzert> grr,"Your local changes to 'setup/install_tools.py' would be overwritten by merge..."
2011-04-22T16:14:51  <amstan> janzert: you should be commiting you changes, lol
2011-04-22T16:15:07  <janzert> everytime I have something that works I do :)
2011-04-22T16:15:24  <jbroman> janzert: You can stash, merge, and then stash apply.
2011-04-22T16:15:36  <janzert> yeah, reading the stash docs now
2011-04-22T16:17:37  <amstan> Contest root directory? [/home/contest]
2011-04-22T16:17:39  <amstan> is that right?
2011-04-22T16:17:46  <amstan> or should it be ~contest/aichallenge
2011-04-22T16:18:11  <janzert> /home/contest
2011-04-22T16:18:41  <janzert> local-repo is aichallenge lives under the contest root
2011-04-22T16:19:31  <amstan> yeah, got it
2011-04-22T16:19:37  <amstan> i assume that this is fine: http://pastebin.com/c8wt9BZ2
2011-04-22T16:19:41  <amstan> i installed apache2"
2011-04-22T16:19:47  <amstan> just before lanunching this
2011-04-22T16:19:53  <amstan> to test my port forwards
2011-04-22T16:20:20  <amstan> janzert: also.. why does the installer need the website hostname?
2011-04-22T16:20:21  <janzert> it's going to change from a worker apache to prefork
2011-04-22T16:20:32  <janzert> for the apache config
2011-04-22T16:21:19  <amstan> so it wasn't a good idea to include the port in there as well then, lol
2011-04-22T16:21:36  <amstan> also: _mysql_exceptions.OperationalError: (1045, "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")
2011-04-22T16:22:05  <janzert> that's probably an expected error
2011-04-22T16:22:14  <janzert> testing whether the contest database already exists
2011-04-22T16:22:17  <amstan> like.. it quit
2011-04-22T16:22:34  <amstan> this step: Executing: echo 'quit' | mysql -u contest -p'contest' aichallenge
2011-04-22T16:23:15  <janzert> pastebin the last few lines?
2011-04-22T16:23:20  <janzert> of output
2011-04-22T16:23:41  <amstan> http://pastebin.com/HNDeZG9y
2011-04-22T16:24:06  <amstan> it seems like it installed the mysql server, but didn't set a password on it or something
2011-04-22T16:24:19  <amstan> i tried blank and "contest"(what i gave it during the wizzard)
2011-04-22T16:24:57  <janzert> you should be able to connect as root with no password
2011-04-22T16:25:16  <janzert> that's the way apt-get installs mysql by default at least in 10.10
2011-04-22T16:25:34  <amstan> yeah, that works
2011-04-22T16:25:54  <janzert> hmm, but yeah that seems to be where it is having a problem in the script
2011-04-22T16:26:13  <amstan> well, there's 2 users now, root and contest
2011-04-22T16:26:58  <amstan> wait.. no.. only root exists
2011-04-22T16:31:26  <amstan> janzert: what can i do now?
2011-04-22T16:32:04  <janzert> I guess try and find out what MySQLdb can't login
2011-04-22T16:32:20  <janzert> it should have been doing the same thing as you just did

2011-04-22T16:34:35  <amstan> janzert: well.. i did give the root pass for the mysql at the beggining as "contest"
2011-04-22T16:34:50  <amstan> i guess that's why it failed, since it didn't change it after it got installed
2011-04-22T16:34:57  <amstan> janzert: can i restart the script?
2011-04-22T16:35:45  <janzert> yeah, it should run fine still after dying in that spot
2011-04-22T16:36:02  <amstan> what about the apache configs? do they get overwritten?
2011-04-22T16:36:16  <janzert> they weren't written yet
2011-04-22T16:36:21  <amstan> oh, ok

2011-04-22T16:37:56  <janzert> looks good
2011-04-22T16:38:30  <janzert> btw, that's basically as far as anything works from the setup script so far :/
2011-04-22T16:38:56  <janzert> I don't really even know what else the current system needs if anything yet
2011-04-22T16:39:08  <McLeopold> memcache
2011-04-22T16:39:39  <amstan> btw.. ssh is provided at ssh contest@hypertriangle.com -p 13022
2011-04-22T16:39:40  <janzert> I meant as far as cron jobs and such ;)
2011-04-22T16:39:50  <McLeopold> oh
2011-04-22T16:40:01  <janzert> but memcach install is as simple as adding the correct package name to the list of required packages
2011-04-22T16:40:10  <amstan> though.. we should get proper users
2011-04-22T16:40:42  <janzert> err, website packages rather
2011-04-22T16:41:08  <amstan> also.. for some reason process_registration.php is blank
2011-04-22T16:41:38  <amstan> McLeopold, janzert: do you guys want users?
2011-04-22T16:41:58  <janzert> I don't think I need it
2011-04-22T16:42:09  <McLeopold> to ssh into it?
2011-04-22T16:42:14  <janzert> as in the process_registration file itself or the result?
2011-04-22T16:42:17  <amstan> yes
2011-04-22T16:42:22  <amstan> janzert: results
2011-04-22T16:42:25  <amstan> janzert: might be a php error
2011-04-22T16:42:29  <amstan> janzert: i'll look into it after users
2011-04-22T16:42:34  <McLeopold> I'd rather just git a webpage or something that shows test errors
2011-04-22T16:42:53  <McLeopold> Maybe we would want to change server_info?
2011-04-22T16:45:12  <janzert> amstan: my guess on the process_registration problem is change mailer_address in server_info.php to "donotsend" should fix it, otherwise set it up to actually be able to send email.
2011-04-22T16:45:24  <janzert> that is something not handled by the setup script at all yet

2011-04-22T19:40:55  <janzert> they should be reading it out of the server_info.php, although I don't know if they really do
2011-04-22T19:41:13  <janzert> but I seem to recall McLeopold fixed that quite a while back

2011-04-22T19:49:38  <jaycobcoleman> Pretty good. Yourself?
2011-04-22T19:50:01  <McLeopold> okay, I've been out of touch lately.  I noticed in the irc logs you had some ideas for the python bot?
2011-04-22T19:50:25  <jaycobcoleman> regarding what specifically?
2011-04-22T19:50:32  <McLeopold> dead ants and vision
2011-04-22T19:50:40  <janzert> amstan: guess you're planning on the contest being farther away than I thought, since you say to use ubuntu 11.10 ;)
2011-04-22T19:50:41  <McLeopold> I think I got vision working per the util files
2011-04-22T19:50:54  <jaycobcoleman> I'm glad you changed the vision code. That's the one I was hoping for
2011-04-22T19:51:03  <amstan> janzert: ohsit, lol where?
2011-04-22T19:51:08  <jaycobcoleman> thanks to sigh : )
2011-04-22T19:51:13  <janzert> first step of install.md
2011-04-22T19:51:17  <amstan> oh man
2011-04-22T19:51:27  <janzert> :)
2011-04-22T19:51:34  <amstan> so.. we might as well say: install: requirements: a time machine or wait 5 months
2011-04-22T19:51:35  <jaycobcoleman> I'm working on a close variant of that method and I'll compare them to see how it works
2011-04-22T19:52:54  <jaycobcoleman> as for dead ants, sorting the inputs in the ants.py that controls the game right before the new line and then ouput would allow you to leave the old code for dead ants exactly as it was
2011-04-22T19:53:10  <jaycobcoleman> in the python ants.py
2011-04-22T19:53:47  <McLeopold> I updated the starter bot today, I just put in an if that said don't overwrite non-land data with dead ant data
2011-04-22T19:54:01  <janzert> amstan: also where does check_submit.php not use the server_info variable?
2011-04-22T19:54:03  <McLeopold> the starterbot still has the dead ant list, so people can use it
2011-04-22T19:54:16  <amstan> janzert: i'm going to trace that now
2011-04-22T19:54:28  <janzert> ok
2011-04-22T19:54:37  <McLeopold> check_submit.php has an include at the top for server_info.php
2011-04-22T19:54:55  <McLeopold> the website mixes require_once and includes, which I'm not sure if that is bad practice

2011-04-22T19:55:13  <McLeopold> I just left things alone when I didn't need to touch them
2011-04-22T19:55:13  <amstan> submissions2 eh?
2011-04-22T19:55:35  <McLeopold> that's the submissionid
2011-04-22T19:55:41  <McLeopold> it's missing a path separator
2011-04-22T19:56:21  <McLeopold> line 73 needs some extra stuff in it
2011-04-22T19:56:24  <janzert> I thought it was using a 2 tier directory layout now?
2011-04-22T19:56:49  <McLeopold> oh, my submission_directory probably had a trailing slash, so it worked for me
2011-04-22T19:56:56  <amstan> McLeopold: $target_path = $destination_folder . '/' . $filename;
2011-04-22T19:57:09  <McLeopold> or fix the server_info.php
2011-04-22T19:57:16  <McLeopold> does php have an os.path.join?
2011-04-22T19:57:30  <amstan> McLeopold: no idea, i always hardcoded it
2011-04-22T19:58:01  <amstan> first website i made.. hardcoded everything to use \ slashes
2011-04-22T19:58:06  <amstan> grated i was in grade 6
2011-04-22T19:58:10  <amstan> granted*
2011-04-22T19:58:13  <McLeopold> :)
2011-04-22T19:58:43  <McLeopold> well, it ought to check to see if a separator already exists at the end of the server_info vars
2011-04-22T19:59:22  <McLeopold> I'd put the slash in server_info.php and try again
2011-04-22T19:59:39  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, but then you have to add that slash in the install script somewhere
2011-04-22T19:59:45  <McLeopold> yep
2011-04-22T19:59:50  <amstan> better fix the php instead
2011-04-22T20:00:01  <amstan> having 2 slashes will work, having none doesn't
2011-04-22T20:00:02  <McLeopold> adding a slash in the php is not better, just different
2011-04-22T20:00:06  <McLeopold> 2 will work?

2011-04-22T20:00:55  <janzert> apparently there is nothing built in
2011-04-22T20:00:59  <McLeopold> okay, so, better safe than sorry, I guess
2011-04-22T20:01:14  <McLeopold> janzert: that seems very unlike the php way

2011-04-22T20:04:46  <amstan> oh! is it writable by www-data?
2011-04-22T20:04:49  <janzert> does /home/contest/submissions/5/ exist?
2011-04-22T20:04:56  <amstan> janzert: that too
2011-04-22T20:04:57  <janzert> ahh, there's a thought
2011-04-22T20:05:14  <McLeopold> line 80 is a mkdir
2011-04-22T20:05:25  <McLeopold> so, it is probably permissions
2011-04-22T20:05:33  <janzert> I bet the setup script didn't get the submission directory permission correct
2011-04-22T20:06:12  <amstan> janzert: how would you set that? chown www-data:www-data?
2011-04-22T20:06:20  <amstan> i would use setfacl, but it's more complicated to setup
2011-04-22T20:06:34  <janzert> I think we want it owned by the contest user
2011-04-22T20:06:48  <janzert> maybe www-data group or world writable
2011-04-22T20:06:57  <janzert> not sure which or if either is better
2011-04-22T20:07:02  <amstan> when php mobes it, he'll create a new file with www-data:www-data as permissions
2011-04-22T20:07:09  <amstan> moves*
2011-04-22T20:07:14  <amstan> i'll make it group

2011-04-22T20:17:30  <amstan> can i change that?
2011-04-22T20:17:39  <amstan> the interval
2011-04-22T20:18:27  <janzert> so long as the pairing has been switched to player based (I believe McLeopold was making it that way) the interval can be removed altogether yes
2011-04-22T20:18:46  <janzert> it should just check that the previous submission has finished going through the submit process
2011-04-22T20:19:21  <McLeopold> amstan: line 85-86 of submission.php
2011-04-22T20:19:43  <McLeopold> but, you need worker.py running compile tasks to get past status 20
2011-04-22T20:20:12  <amstan> so then if your submission doesn't get compiled, you can't resubmit it?
2011-04-22T20:20:21  <McLeopold> correct
2011-04-22T20:20:24  <janzert> yes
2011-04-22T20:20:28  <amstan> ew
2011-04-22T20:20:30  <amstan> lol
2011-04-22T20:20:38  <janzert> otherwise they can just keep piling up the submission queue
2011-04-22T20:21:00  <janzert> if the queue isn't being processed there's no reason to allow them to keep submitting anyway
2011-04-22T20:21:45  <janzert> a more informative message wouldn't be a bad idea though :)
2011-04-22T20:21:48  <amstan> how does it even get past 20 anyway? isn't there many workers that have to all compile it?
2011-04-22T20:22:12  <janzert> just the first one takes and tests that it compiles sucessfully
2011-04-22T20:22:18  <McLeopold> python worker.py -t -n 0
2011-04-22T20:22:24  <janzert> the rest compile as they need that submission to play a game
2011-04-22T20:22:47  <McLeopold> that will start a worker and continuosly get tasks from the server
2011-04-22T20:23:05  <McLeopold> including creating matchups if there are no compile tasks
2011-04-22T20:23:18  <McLeopold> I expect that part to crash gloriously
2011-04-22T20:23:57  <McLeopold> amstan: the first compile also does the submission test game and reports the status

2011-04-22T23:02:44  <amstan> Stocha: server part should be complete
2011-04-22T23:02:51  <Stocha> i don't know about the color
2011-04-22T23:03:03  <Stocha> i'm color blind. i like the shape though
2011-04-22T23:04:43  <janzert> Stocha: if you do try to set up a server be warned, the last line of the server section should just not be there as it's not accurate and no longer needed also the worker section is completely outdated
2011-04-22T23:05:25  <Stocha> it seems complicated :/
2011-04-22T23:05:50  <janzert> it's really not that bad, but it is a rather complex system so...
2011-04-22T23:05:51  <Stocha> do you need mysql or not ? i didn't get it.
2011-04-22T23:06:12  <janzert> yes, but the server setup script will install it
2011-04-22T23:06:32  <Stocha> what passwd is to be blank ?
2011-04-22T23:06:44  <amstan> Stocha: the root mysql pass

2011-04-22T23:12:32  <Stocha> i don't have it installed.  but leaving the passwd blank seems dangerous

2011-04-22T23:13:04  <amstan> jbroman: phpmyadmin is wide open
2011-04-22T23:13:07  <jbroman> (Haven't checked recently, but I thought it either had networking off or was bound to loopback)
2011-04-22T23:13:07  <Stocha> ah maybe
2011-04-22T23:13:18  <Stocha> if it doesn't that's less of a problem
2011-04-22T23:13:18  <jbroman> Oh sure, it's still not a good idea to have a blank root pw.
2011-04-22T23:13:20  <amstan> but like.. there's not much they can take anyway
2011-04-22T23:13:45  <amstan> oh nvm.. you can't login with it anyway, phpmyadmin doesn't let you
2011-04-22T23:13:47  <Stocha> i don't know what they are trying to do. nothing good i would say
2011-04-22T23:13:53  <janzert> yeah last I checked you shouldn't be able to access it unless you have local user access

2011-04-22T23:14:25  <janzert> and if you're going to install phpmyadmin it's your responsibility to make it secure ;)

2011-04-22T23:15:24  <Stocha> he is the official graphist then
2011-04-22T23:16:00  <Stocha> how does a sever work ?
2011-04-22T23:16:06  <Stocha> does it rank a set of local bot ?
2011-04-22T23:16:25  <janzert> ? the server is the full contest setup
2011-04-22T23:16:33  <amstan> janzert: not yet
2011-04-22T23:16:36  <janzert> well server and corresponding workers that is
2011-04-22T23:16:40  <amstan> i didn't get the cronjobs setup yet
2011-04-22T23:16:45  <amstan> and the workers either
2011-04-22T23:16:50  <Stocha> i'm wondering about what to make to render it tcp compatible
2011-04-22T23:17:24  <janzert> tcp servers use quite a different backend infrastructure
2011-04-22T23:17:33  <Stocha> why ?
2011-04-22T23:17:38  <Stocha> it doesn't need to
2011-04-22T23:17:48  <janzert> because the do quite a different job :)
2011-04-22T23:17:51  <Stocha> unless the official one has problems
2011-04-22T23:18:01  <Stocha> what does the official one do ?
2011-04-22T23:18:12  <Stocha> it's not about ranking bot, and letting people see games ?
2011-04-22T23:18:13  <janzert> they don't need all the infrastructure the official one needs for starters
2011-04-22T23:18:32  <Stocha> ah they could be more lightweight true
2011-04-22T23:19:00  <janzert> starting from the planetwars tcp server is probably a better starting point for an ants tcp server
2011-04-22T23:19:09  <Stocha> but the thing is, the infrastructure is there. so some people will be able to install it quicker than developping a new lightweight one
2011-04-22T23:19:27  <Stocha> do you have a planetwars tcp server that i could install ?
2011-04-22T23:19:57  <janzert> check the old planetwar tcp servers I thought they had source available
2011-04-22T23:20:07  <amstan> Stocha: it's on the forums
2011-04-22T23:20:12  <Stocha> mm
2011-04-22T23:20:58  <janzert> besides infrastructure the main server pairing algorithms aren't going to appropriate for a tcp server
2011-04-22T23:21:17  <janzert> since a tcp server needs to work with whatever clients happen to be connected at the time
2011-04-22T23:23:16  <Stocha> i though you could resubmit your bots anytime ?
2011-04-22T23:23:26  <Stocha> what is it doesn't run properly then ?
2011-04-22T23:23:54  <janzert> if it doesn't pass the initial test it is never entered into active participation
2011-04-22T23:23:59  <Stocha> say you submit a 1500 strength bot, and then submit one that timeout always.
2011-04-22T23:24:19  <Stocha> it times out, but not during the tests then :p
2011-04-22T23:24:20  <janzert> if it does pass the initial test but then crashes in all your games then you start piling up losses
2011-04-22T23:24:41  <janzert> see the bottom bunch of bots in the planetwars leaderboard :}
2011-04-22T23:24:54  <Stocha> the ranking is dynamic enough that it can handle such cases well ?
2011-04-22T23:25:17  <janzert> yeah, your rank is basically reset to completely uncertain when you resubmit
2011-04-22T23:25:22  <Stocha> 1500 strengh then 0 then 2000. will attain 2000.
2011-04-22T23:25:26  <Stocha> ah
2011-04-22T23:25:41  <Stocha> how do people use a tcp server ?
2011-04-22T23:25:52  <Stocha> they do not let their bot play for a long time ?
2011-04-22T23:26:07  <janzert> not most people I don't believe
2011-04-22T23:26:11  <Stocha> the bad cases being when the bot get disconected i guess
2011-04-22T23:26:21  <janzert> in fact the default client for a long time only played one game and quit
2011-04-22T23:26:23  <Stocha> what do they use the tcp server for then ?
2011-04-22T23:26:30  <janzert> testing
2011-04-22T23:26:46  <Stocha> what kind of testing is one game testing achieving ?
2011-04-22T23:27:00  <Stocha> or they just don't want to run the games themselves ?
2011-04-22T23:27:03  <janzert> they know it runs and they look at the game to see what they want to change I suppose
2011-04-22T23:27:21  <amstan> contestbot: betatest
2011-04-22T23:27:22  <contestbot> amstan: betatest could be http://hypertriangle.com:13080/.
2011-04-22T23:27:33  <janzert> generally it gives you an instant game against fairly strong opponent
2011-04-22T23:27:53  <Stocha> so tcp server isn't about ranking their bots for most people ?
2011-04-22T23:28:04  <Stocha> i guess there would be two tcp scenario then
2011-04-22T23:28:04  <janzert> not primarily I don't think
2011-04-22T23:28:16  <Stocha> one for ranking a bot, and one for getting a few games.
2011-04-22T23:28:38  <Stocha> what i need is to have some sort of objective comparison for sure.
2011-04-22T23:30:11  <Stocha> it seems quite a bit of work to have the tcp server if not reusing official stuff.
2011-04-22T23:30:51  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-pbhkxeancykzlklb> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-22T23:31:08  <janzert> I just doubt there is much of the official stuff that is actually reusable
2011-04-22T23:31:27  <Stocha> the playonegame certainly is
2011-04-22T23:31:34  <janzert> but I'm not the one doing it so, take my advice for what it's worth
2011-04-22T23:31:35  *** Mathnerd314 <Mathnerd314!~mathnerd3@128.198.16.160> has quit IRC (Disconnected by services)
2011-04-22T23:31:55  <janzert> ok, the ants directory is certainly going to have useful stuff
2011-04-22T23:31:59  <Stocha> at least tcp server should use official rules and formats.
2011-04-22T23:32:06  <janzert> I don't think of that as the server
2011-04-22T23:32:19  <janzert> yes the official engine should be used if possible
2011-04-22T23:32:28  *** Mathnerd314_ <Mathnerd314_!~mathnerd3@206.53.28.6> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-22T23:32:30  <Stocha> if the use case is just having a few games mmm
2011-04-22T23:32:46  <Stocha> the game result is embeded in the game format ?
2011-04-22T23:32:58  <Stocha> but not the players name i think.
2011-04-22T23:33:21  *** Mathnerd314_ is now known as Mathnerd314
2011-04-22T23:33:29  <Stocha> is there a player id in the format ?
2011-04-22T23:33:40  <Stocha> i should have a look at it i guess
2011-04-22T23:35:11  <Stocha> the player name is in the format. where did i get the idea it wasn't
2011-04-22T23:35:22  <amstan> computerwiz_222: min-height:
2011-04-22T23:35:24  <janzert> I'm not terribly familiar with the current game formats
2011-04-22T23:36:43  <Stocha> does the onegame script put in the storage header ?
2011-04-22T23:36:53  <janzert> no, idea :)
2011-04-22T23:37:03  <Stocha> i guess i'll check that
2011-04-22T23:37:22  <janzert> I really do limit myself to working on the server side of things and I haven't had much time for even that :/
2011-04-22T23:39:10  <Stocha> mm i'm confused
2011-04-22T23:39:23  <Stocha> i don't even remember how to use the playonegame :p
2011-04-22T23:40:07  <Stocha> true i wasn't the one that did the testing with the official stuff. only a game to check that my wrapper indeed worked with official engine.
2011-04-22T23:41:00  <Stocha> i guess i'm in no position to plan for the tcp thingy. you have to know the ant directory and functions and replay format well.
2011-04-22T23:41:13  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-pbhkxeancykzlklb> has quit IRC (Quit: bhasker)
2011-04-22T23:41:16  <Stocha> who does know that ant directory well then ?
2011-04-22T23:41:31  <janzert> sigh, Mcleopold
2011-04-22T23:41:32  <Stocha> ants

2011-04-22T23:41:57  <contestbot> Stocha: Mcleopold was last seen in #aichallenge 2 hours, 37 minutes, and 24 seconds ago: <McLeopold> amstan: I don't understand your comment?
2011-04-22T23:43:31  <Stocha> how does official ranking work ?
2011-04-22T23:43:53  <Stocha> i mean do you feed games linearly to a script ?
2011-04-22T23:44:04  <amstan> Stocha: it's described on the wiki
2011-04-22T23:44:07  <Stocha> it check the header, and update whatever states it maintains ?
2011-04-22T23:44:33  <amstan> idk much more
2011-04-22T23:44:39  <Stocha> is there a script you can run with mocked game, and get a ranking out of it ?
2011-04-22T23:45:35  <amstan> i think there's a script already done, but idk how to use it or if it's hooked up
2011-04-22T23:45:41  <Stocha> i don't see anything in the wiki that would help me understand how to do that.
2011-04-22T23:46:11  <janzert> Mcleopold has been doing the ranking stuff and I haven't been paying real close attention but I believe it is pretty much all done in sql now and triggered when adding a game result to the database
2011-04-22T23:46:33  <amstan> the usage of the script is not there, but the method is described in great detail at https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/TrueSkill-Matchmaking
2011-04-22T23:46:39  <janzert> i.e. no I don't think there is a sript you could easily run and feed mocked games to
2011-04-22T23:46:41  <Stocha> so there might not be any script
2011-04-22T23:47:24  <Stocha> will the raw games result be available for people to run their own ranking stuff ?
2011-04-22T23:47:53  <Stocha> i suppose the whole game setup will be available
2011-04-22T23:48:12  <Stocha> still it would be good if people could see how the ranking work locally.
2011-04-22T23:48:26  <Stocha> and use it on their own tcp server or something :p
2011-04-22T23:48:30  <janzert> I was able to make that available pretty easily in the last contest, it probably won't be quite as easy to do this time
2011-04-22T23:48:37  <janzert> but I don't think it will be terribly hard
2011-04-22T23:48:56  <Stocha> what forms take the rankng algorithm ?
2011-04-22T23:49:08  <Stocha> is it a python script somewhere ?
2011-04-22T23:49:11  <janzert> ?
2011-04-22T23:49:26  <amstan> Stocha: yes, check the repo, it's in there somewhere
2011-04-22T23:49:53  <amstan> https://github.com/aichallenge/trueskill
2011-04-22T23:49:53  <janzert> that's a part of what I was referring to above, I believe it's pretty much all sql now
2011-04-22T23:50:14  <janzert> amstan: is that actually used anywhere?
2011-04-22T23:50:34  <amstan> janzert: yes, i think the stuff  you are reffering to is the matchmaking
2011-04-22T23:50:41  <amstan> the scores are calculated with that python
2011-04-22T23:50:46  <amstan> since it's pretty complex
2011-04-22T23:50:55  <Stocha> i don't see it when browsing
2011-04-22T23:53:11  <Stocha> https://github.com/aichallenge/trueskill/blob/master/sample.py
2011-04-22T23:53:14  <amstan> contestbot: learn newdesign as http://home.hypertriangle.com/~andrew/aicontest/
2011-04-22T23:53:14  <contestbot> amstan: Ready to serve, my lord.
2011-04-22T23:53:20  <Stocha> it seems i have trouble understanding python :p
2011-04-22T23:54:01  <amstan> contestbot: betatest
2011-04-22T23:54:02  <contestbot> amstan: betatest could be http://hypertriangle.com:13080/.
2011-04-22T23:54:35  <Stocha> ah the trueskill things is not in the epsilon challenge yet i guess
2011-04-22T23:54:50  <Stocha> still i'd like to understand that sample.py
2011-04-22T23:54:50  <amstan> Stocha: it is, just not hooked up yet

2011-04-22T23:58:29  <Stocha> okay so https://github.com/aichallenge/trueskill/blob/master/trueskill.py is the thing
2011-04-22T23:58:46  <Stocha> with adjustplayer being the main interface
2011-04-22T23:59:46  <antimatroid> jbroman: you're who i harass about getting organisation/country rankings and performance graphs on peoples profiles?
2011-04-22T23:59:53  <Stocha> but it is a stateful python function
