2011-12-09T00:42:57  <BenJackson> since I don't know who on your server is "serious" and who isn't I never know if I'm trouncing some poor newb or if it's just me vs some other guy's dumbed down bot
2011-12-09T00:43:15  <bmh> BenJackson: my bot is fully serious.
2011-12-09T00:44:04  <BenJackson> is your's Wraithan?  that seems to be the only one I'm p[laying
2011-12-09T00:44:07  <bmh> I could really use a function that tells me which square are currently visible.
2011-12-09T00:44:14  <bmh> no, Skynet

2011-12-09T09:05:33  <thestinger> the page worked last night, and I woke up a while ago and refreshed to find a blank page
2011-12-09T09:05:45  <thestinger> so somehow it broke overnight

2011-12-09T09:12:30  <thestinger> turn 175
2011-12-09T09:12:52  <rwest> so many bots in 100-200 ranking range don't have combat
2011-12-09T09:13:08  <thestinger> wow, the sad part is I would have won if I had fixed the bug breaking my nice hill razing
2011-12-09T09:13:08  <rwest> on aichallenge
2011-12-09T09:13:21  <thestinger> because he was moving his ants off the hill right away, and I keep track of that
2011-12-09T09:13:30  <thestinger> but my new combat code breaks my sneaky raze of the hill

2011-12-09T10:13:24  <thestinger> ctrl-D?
2011-12-09T10:13:28  <thestinger> that does EOF and closes the shell
2011-12-09T10:13:32  <rwest> nope
2011-12-09T10:13:39  <rwest> it closes terminator

2011-12-09T10:13:48  <rwest> it has something to do with tab
2011-12-09T10:13:50  <rwest> heh
2011-12-09T10:14:12  <thestinger> I should just disable "close terminal on EOF" or whatever the setting is in zsh

2011-12-09T10:14:24  <rwest> I don't mind that behavior
2011-12-09T10:14:29  <rwest> I do that on purpose
2011-12-09T10:14:34  <rwest> this is some odd hotkey
2011-12-09T10:14:51  <rwest> I hit it every few days
2011-12-09T10:15:10  <rwest> it has to be a system hotkey since I disabled the one in terminator

2011-12-09T10:39:29  <Fluxid>  < rwest> because of being able to have multiple terminals in one without the use of screen ← urxvt has tabs

2011-12-09T11:14:10  <Antimony> yep
2011-12-09T11:14:14  <pairofdice> That's usually a bad thing to assume
2011-12-09T11:14:14  <thestinger> now that I predict moves, my bot sucks at dealing with unmoving enemies compared with how it handled them before
2011-12-09T11:14:20  <Antimony> lol
2011-12-09T11:14:24  <thestinger> I guess I need timeout detection
2011-12-09T11:14:37  <thestinger> but then a bot could _pretend_ to timeout :P
2011-12-09T11:14:45  <pairofdice> Moving enemies are a lot more dangerous than unmoving ones :)
2011-12-09T11:14:52  <Antimony> so do you just try to predict a single move for each enemy, or do you consider multiple possibilities?

2011-12-09T11:15:30  <Antimony> I thought about doing that, but I'm not sure how well it would work
2011-12-09T11:15:32  <thestinger> and then I optimize my attack to deal with both unmoving or moving enemies
2011-12-09T11:15:45  <thestinger> I have a bunch of work started on better ways of doing it
2011-12-09T11:15:49  <thestinger> just need to finish one xD
2011-12-09T11:15:50  <Antimony> if you predict wrong you're at a disadvantage
2011-12-09T11:17:00  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-09T11:17:09  <thestinger> and my ants are too scared to attack unmoving enemies
2011-12-09T11:17:26  <thestinger> it works well enough though
2011-12-09T11:17:54  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2255 http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat that's the old version, which did combat globally

2011-12-09T13:11:10  <BenJackson> for a while my combat code had a score in it I meant to make my ants kill
2011-12-09T13:11:13  *** Redgis <Redgis!~Nex@2a01:e34:ee3b:aa40:ccb:8a1d:94b0:4c6> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-09T13:11:17  <BenJackson> but I had accidentally instead just made them want to die
2011-12-09T13:11:35  <Fluxid> Anilm3: yeah, i try to undertand wtf is going here http://paste.aichallenge.org/GpWxL/
2011-12-09T13:12:50  <thestinger> Fluxid: yeah I have a stalemate issue atm
2011-12-09T13:13:00  <thestinger> cannot figure out why my positioning code doesn't move ants towards the enemy
2011-12-09T13:13:14  <thestinger> like
2011-12-09T13:13:20  <thestinger> it KNOWS it will improve things
2011-12-09T13:13:22  <Fluxid> ant 19,51 thinks "i'll kill when going E!", but 18,51 thinks "oh no, i'll die when i go E!". And then 19,51 thinks "oh o i can't go alone because i'll actually die"
2011-12-09T13:13:25  <thestinger> I see it printed out
2011-12-09T13:13:34  <Fluxid> so those two ants don't move near enemy
2011-12-09T13:13:35  <Fluxid> ffff
2011-12-09T13:13:41  <Anilm3> Fluxid: I had a similar problem on my first and only attempt at combat
2011-12-09T13:14:09  <BenJackson> Fluxid: I posted my version yesterday: http://paste.aichallenge.org/xH1yL/
2011-12-09T13:14:19  <BenJackson> I think it's funny that the whoel thing instantly ends then
2011-12-09T13:15:09  <Fluxid> ah i know why!
2011-12-09T13:15:19  <BenJackson> Are those "trapped" ants to nullify visibility code?

2011-12-09T13:15:43  <Fluxid> 18,51 whinks enemy ant will go N, ant if it really do that they will kill each other
2011-12-09T13:16:15  <Fluxid> so i need some kind of prediction
2011-12-09T13:16:36  <Fluxid> so i can weight result on how probable is enemy going that way
2011-12-09T13:16:37  <Fluxid> ffff
2011-12-09T13:16:43  <Fluxid> now, how do i do this
2011-12-09T13:16:45  <Fluxid> damn
2011-12-09T13:17:05  <thestinger> Fluxid: http://ompldr.org/vYm52YQ
2011-12-09T13:17:10  <thestinger> my latest code ends up with this
2011-12-09T13:17:12  <thestinger> as a stalemate
2011-12-09T13:17:14  <thestinger> lol
2011-12-09T13:17:32  <thestinger> I have code to work around it but.... doesn't work
2011-12-09T13:17:37  <Fluxid> lol
2011-12-09T13:17:48  <thestinger> sometimes* it doesn't work
2011-12-09T13:17:50  <Fluxid> even more scared than mine
2011-12-09T13:17:55  <thestinger> no
2011-12-09T13:17:57  <thestinger> only sometimes
2011-12-09T13:17:59  <thestinger> :P
2011-12-09T13:18:04  <thestinger> oh and the best part?
2011-12-09T13:18:10  <thestinger> making my ants not chase enemies gets rid of the bug

2011-12-09T14:37:03  <McLeopold> janzert: while I'm thinking about it, for next contests, what do you think about automatic deactivation for crashing and timeouts?
2011-12-09T14:37:23  <UncleVasya> olexs: Hi. How's your bot doing?
2011-12-09T14:37:43  <delt0r> McLeopold: you mean till a new submission? yea a very good idea... IMO only of course
2011-12-09T14:38:11  <janzert> hmm, that's basically what it was in tron and people like this much better
2011-12-09T14:38:39  <janzert> this is certainly much more forgiving
2011-12-09T14:38:50  <janzert> I wouldn't mind a zero score for the game though
2011-12-09T14:39:15  <McLeopold> well, I want to separate game scoring and rules from this
2011-12-09T14:39:22  <McLeopold> this is just for matchmaking
2011-12-09T14:39:46  <janzert> yeah, I don't think pulling them out is a good idea
2011-12-09T14:39:49  <McLeopold> it would follow the normal deactivation rules, just happen sooner
2011-12-09T14:40:05  <McLeopold> not for finals of course

2011-12-09T14:41:18  <janzert> but I would really want the rule to be in place for both the open contest and finals if used
2011-12-09T14:41:36  <janzert> I'm not too opposed to it personally but I think a lot would be
2011-12-09T14:41:37  <McLeopold> deactivation isn't happening for finals
2011-12-09T14:42:42  <McLeopold> so, I don't see a problem
2011-12-09T14:43:06  <McLeopold> deactivation happens after 3 days already, this is just a rule to make it happen sooner for trouble bots

2011-12-09T14:50:18  <janzert> that's just what my mind jumped to since that is what happened with tron :/
2011-12-09T14:52:42  <UncleVasya> Me thought about discvalification of current version too. I even wrote a big message but lucky decided to look more carefuly on the discussion before pressing Enter.

2011-12-09T17:34:31  <antimatroid> it looks like he got involved late to me
2011-12-09T17:34:41  <antimatroid> and had to switch from python to c++
2011-12-09T17:35:52  <Wraithan> Meh, most of the people who have to do that, could have just switched to pypy and got a 5x-20x speed increase
2011-12-09T17:37:48  <Minthos> I'm using D, which admittedly is not quite as fast as C++ but its tight loops should be pretty close, and I have to worry about how much time my bot uses
2011-12-09T17:38:46  <Minthos> hundreds of ants is no problem, but on a big map the cpu use gets pretty high (100-200 ms locally, which means 250-500 ms on the server)
2011-12-09T17:38:48  <Wraithan> pypy is the same, in tight loops and such it can be as fast or faster then C
2011-12-09T17:39:18  <Wraithan> JITing lends itself very well to tight repetitive loops.

2011-12-09T17:42:19  <BenJackson> Minthos: Really?  My Q6600 seems to be slightly slower than the contest servers
2011-12-09T17:42:29  <BenJackson> 2.4G
2011-12-09T17:42:54  <Minthos> that's weird, I'm also using a q6600
2011-12-09T17:46:03  <Minthos> one of my early submissions that scaled workload with ants, used to time out at around 150 ants on the official server
2011-12-09T17:46:29  <Minthos> it worked fine locally, but when I set timeout to 250, 200 or 150 ms, it would timeout more and more frequently
2011-12-09T17:47:15  <BenJackson> I haven't been timing out (since I quit using python on day 2) so I haven't worried about it
2011-12-09T17:47:26  <BenJackson> but I did seem to see some long compute times locally for high ant games
2011-12-09T17:47:33  <BenJackson> but those did not cause timeouts on the server
2011-12-09T17:47:53  <BenJackson> I suspect wall clock timing will always be somewhat random
2011-12-09T17:47:56  <Minthos> it could be multitasking locally..
2011-12-09T17:48:02  <BenJackson> I work on embedded linux devices at my day job
2011-12-09T17:48:05  <Minthos> and that, yes
2011-12-09T17:48:08  <BenJackson> I've seen the linux scheduler do some really stupid things
2011-12-09T17:48:22  <BenJackson> so counting on the system scheduler to put 10 bots on 10 cpus is a fantasy
2011-12-09T17:48:42  <BenJackson> unless there's a taskset in there somewhere I didn't see
2011-12-09T17:48:59  <Minthos> the contest servers are virtualized, I suspect there are considerable delays/overheads in task switching both on the host and vm
2011-12-09T17:56:20  <Anilm3> does anyone know what does it mean when people write a word between underscores? e.g. _word_
2011-12-09T17:57:32  <BenJackson> It means underlined, which in historical typesetting meant to italicize
2011-12-09T17:57:40  <BenJackson> (because you could understrike on a typewriter)
2011-12-09T17:57:48  <Minthos> no, underline is underline
2011-12-09T17:57:55  <Minthos> italic is /italic/
2011-12-09T17:58:07  <Minthos> _this_ is underline
2011-12-09T17:58:14  <Anilm3> I understand it's underline but what is the meaning?
2011-12-09T17:58:35  <BenJackson> you underline book titles
2011-12-09T17:58:41  <Minthos> added significance, like italicizing or making bold
2011-12-09T17:58:41  <BenJackson> other than that just emphasis
2011-12-09T17:59:39  <Anilm3> I see, thanks
2011-12-09T17:59:45  <Minthos> underline is _not_ the same as italic (emphasis mine)
2011-12-09T17:59:54  <Minthos> ;)
2011-12-09T18:01:28  <Minthos> *stars* is sometimes used for emphasis, but conventionally it's used for actions
2011-12-09T18:01:47  <Minthos> as in *jumps up and down like a jackrabbit on crack*

2011-12-09T21:59:43  <besh> My bot produced a bunch of "duplicate move errors". When re-running the game using bot-input data , i don't see the error because my bot doesn't check for legality of moves.

2011-12-09T22:06:42  <besh> the problem is i know there are duplicate moves somewhere in the 1300th turn but i don't know where.
2011-12-09T22:06:56  <Anilm3> run your bot alone
2011-12-09T22:06:59  <Anilm3> with the input
2011-12-09T22:07:12  <BenJackson> just make sure if you use random numbers you use the seed from the game
2011-12-09T22:07:25  <besh> yes the bot produces all the moves but it doesn't tell me if there are duplicates.
2011-12-09T22:07:34  <Anilm3> modify the bot
2011-12-09T22:07:40  <Anilm3> to print to a log file or something
2011-12-09T22:07:45  <Anilm3> and then do it
2011-12-09T22:08:14  <besh> I have all the moves from turn 1 - 1500 but how do you check for duplicates ?
2011-12-09T22:09:47  <besh> i guess it is doable but would be much easier if i can  pass it trhough the script

2011-12-09T22:26:29  <BenJackson> so aa would both go west.  probably most b bots would go east too
2011-12-09T22:26:38  <BenJackson> THEN maybe a reorganizes
2011-12-09T22:28:31  <besh> antimatroid: my bot could do it two ways  firs a south and second a east (the best option)
2011-12-09T22:28:51  <besh> second a south
2011-12-09T22:28:58  <BenJackson> oh yeah
2011-12-09T22:29:11  <BenJackson> see this is why I wrote a program to do combat :)
2011-12-09T22:29:34  <antimatroid> besh: but are you picking that from a near full minimax?
2011-12-09T22:30:07  <antimatroid> i want to pass my game tree a set of offensive moves and a set of defensive moves and just run minimax on that
2011-12-09T22:30:09  <besh> no minmax. the first 'a' can not move because it is suicide.
2011-12-09T22:30:24  <antimatroid> it can move, just not west
2011-12-09T22:30:41  <besh> you mean not east ?
2011-12-09T22:30:45  <antimatroid> yeah sorry
2011-12-09T22:30:51  <antimatroid> i would move the middle a for offense first anyway
2011-12-09T22:31:02  <antimatroid> but how do you know to move him up/down there rather than east?
2011-12-09T22:31:22  <antimatroid> for offensive i would normally just place it where it minimises the positive number of potential battle enemies
2011-12-09T22:31:26  <besh> i collect attackers on radius + 1 and radius + 2 for enemy ants
2011-12-09T22:31:34  <BenJackson> I built a version of my bot without optimization
2011-12-09T22:31:39  <besh> i start from the closest (radius + 1)
2011-12-09T22:31:39  <BenJackson> times out instantly in combat!
2011-12-09T22:32:47  <antimatroid> i have an idea but i don't know how much i like it
2011-12-09T22:33:50  <antimatroid> like as well as counting potential battle enemies for each move loc, get the total sum for all move locs battleable from and minimise that?
2011-12-09T22:34:48  <besh> you mean an influence map approach like memetix described ?

2011-12-09T22:38:19  <antimatroid> well, whatever people are calling htem
2011-12-09T22:38:24  <antimatroid> i've been using it for a while
2011-12-09T22:39:06  <antimatroid> i only work out the information for locations ants can move into
2011-12-09T22:39:49  <antimatroid> and i store "battle locations" for static and non-static ants next turn
2011-12-09T22:40:15  <Antimony> ug my bot refuses to run locally
2011-12-09T22:40:17  <antimatroid> are people tracking where possible enemies might be?
2011-12-09T22:40:22  <Antimony> I do
2011-12-09T22:40:29  <Antimony> I use a conservative method though
2011-12-09T22:40:35  <antimatroid> i use that to set up my perimeter
2011-12-09T22:40:45  <Antimony> Inivsible squares are marked if any neighbors were last turn
2011-12-09T22:40:57  <Antimony> and visible squares are obviously marked iff there's an ant there
2011-12-09T22:41:05  <antimatroid> i just store a bool as to whether an enemy might be somewhere, everything starts as true, then i propogate the information each turn
2011-12-09T22:41:11  <besh> that is interesting
2011-12-09T22:41:14  <Antimony> I guess that's the same as me
2011-12-09T22:41:16  <antimatroid> so i can set up a perimeter around my hill
2011-12-09T22:41:19  <antimatroid> where i know an enemy isn't
2011-12-09T22:41:26  <antimatroid> and not have to go back in and suss it out straight away
2011-12-09T22:41:38  <Antimony> I don't have a perimeter per se. I just say that ants have to be closer than the closest possible enemy
2011-12-09T22:41:58  <antimatroid> are you resetting a non-visible square as a possible enemy?
2011-12-09T22:41:59  <antimatroid> i don't do that
2011-12-09T22:42:11  <Antimony> nonvisible squares are true if any neighbors were last turn

2011-12-09T22:42:36  <antimatroid> yep
2011-12-09T22:42:39  <antimatroid> that's waht i do
2011-12-09T22:43:04  <Antimony> I've been thinking about more sophisticated and accurate methods, but they seem too complex
2011-12-09T22:43:23  <antimatroid> what probability based?
2011-12-09T22:43:32  <Antimony> One idea is that once you find all the hills, mark all squares that are more than turn distances away as false
2011-12-09T22:43:38  <Antimony> on old maps, it's useless
2011-12-09T22:43:41  <Extrarius> what is the usual area given to each player on a map? I seem to remember the average player gets 20x20 or something like that
2011-12-09T22:43:44  <Antimony> but some of the new maps start hills close together
2011-12-09T22:43:44  <antimatroid> i thought about using markov chains, but not really sure how i'd use the additional info
2011-12-09T22:43:56  <Antimony> per player area is 900-5000

2011-12-09T22:46:44  <Antimony> cobmat is more important
2011-12-09T22:46:51  <antimatroid> i came up with most of the "symmetries", so i think it might come off as bad if i also try/exploit it
2011-12-09T22:47:01  <Antimony> what?
2011-12-09T22:47:07  <BenJackson> antimatroid: just because I didn't find it advantageous doesn't mean someone else couldn't use it
2011-12-09T22:47:14  <Antimony> the possible symmetries is a well defeind set
2011-12-09T22:47:23  <antimatroid> i know that, i'm not saying i literally invented them
2011-12-09T22:47:34  <antimatroid> but i went through and worked out how to do the ones we're using
2011-12-09T22:48:07  <antimatroid> it was still fun to work out how to do the translationally symmetric maps, even if it had been done previously :P
2011-12-09T22:48:26  <antimatroid> although i'm not sure where tbh?
2011-12-09T22:49:04  <Antimony> I'm tempted to just say how I did mine. There's probably not enough time to actually implement it. Especially since I'm still finding bugs in mine
2011-12-09T22:49:22  <Antimony> moral of the story, test on all possible types of maps
2011-12-09T22:50:57  <antimatroid> like, do you know anywhere that describes how to do translational symmetry on the surface of a torus? with the n = noPlayers = lcm(rows/gcd(rows, row_translate), cols/gcd(cols, col_translate)) forumulate such that translate^n(loc) = loc for all locations loc?
2011-12-09T22:51:15  <antimatroid> formula*/whatever
2011-12-09T22:52:00  <Antimony> well it's not hard to rederive
2011-12-09T22:52:07  <antimatroid> yes, it's fun :P
2011-12-09T22:52:12  <Antimony> that's what I did
2011-12-09T22:52:27  <antimatroid> but i can't find that anywhere on the interwebs?
2011-12-09T22:52:31  <antimatroid> except a reddit post i made
2011-12-09T22:52:51  <Antimony> the tricky part is "extra symmetries"
2011-12-09T22:52:58  <antimatroid> extra?
2011-12-09T22:53:05  <antimatroid> as in the rigid rotation ones?
2011-12-09T22:53:05  <Antimony> for example a completely blank map can have rotational symmetry even if it's rectangular
2011-12-09T22:53:42  <antimatroid> did my translating those maps make symmetry detection any harder for you?
2011-12-09T22:53:44  <antimatroid> i thought it might
2011-12-09T22:53:47  <Antimony> no
2011-12-09T22:53:57  <antimatroid> do you see why i thought it might?
2011-12-09T22:54:08  <Antimony> bots naivly assume they rotate around the center?
2011-12-09T22:54:13  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-09T22:54:20  <besh> btw what do you use symmerty detection for ?
2011-12-09T22:54:27  <antimatroid> water information
2011-12-09T22:54:28  <Antimony> my bot uses first hill it sees as the origin for all coordinates
2011-12-09T22:54:28  <antimatroid> path finding
2011-12-09T22:54:36  <antimatroid> and knowing where enemy hills are etc.
2011-12-09T22:54:40  <Antimony> but it can rotate at any offset
2011-12-09T22:54:53  <antimatroid> Antimony: what about say.... a.b.c.d.
2011-12-09T22:55:01  <Antimony> ?
2011-12-09T22:55:03  <antimatroid> if you see c before b and d you might assume there's only 2 players?
2011-12-09T22:55:10  <Antimony> no the first of your own hills
2011-12-09T22:55:19  <Antimony> well, actually the one that is sorted first
2011-12-09T22:55:23  <Antimony> so probably the most top left one
2011-12-09T22:55:23  <antimatroid> oh i see
2011-12-09T22:55:50  <Antimony> anyway, I think my bot can handle all that stuff
2011-12-09T22:56:13  <Antimony> it doesnt stop until it can prove there are no more players
2011-12-09T22:56:33  <antimatroid> i still think it was worth translating those maps so that people can't just check the coordinates like how you'd make it

2011-12-09T22:58:18  <Antimony> since it gives syemmtry a bigger advantage

2011-12-09T23:09:01  <antimatroid> also, i'm a big fan of allowing smaller width corridors, but a 3x3 block must be able to traverse between hills on the map
2011-12-09T23:09:43  <antimatroid> don't think there's a problem, just explicitly saying :)
2011-12-09T23:10:02  <Extrarius> hrmm, that makes it more difficult to make 'interesting' maps =-/ I'll play around with adding that constraint
2011-12-09T23:10:20  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-12-09T23:10:42  <antimatroid> just start with like a 3x3 block and add hills, then finish the map

2011-12-09T23:11:26  <antimatroid> but it'd be cool to use it as an official map gen, but you'd need to meet the requirements for that to be worthwhile..

2011-12-09T23:14:21  <antimatroid> Extrarius: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Map-Format bottom of that page looks about right?
2011-12-09T23:14:56  <antimatroid> oh waht
2011-12-09T23:14:59  <Extrarius> as much as people are working on combat, I wonder how many can do things like realize they have ants to spare and accept major losses to take hills
2011-12-09T23:15:00  <besh> antimatroid: for lining up for attack what i do is to stop the ants at radius + 2. Simple but effective.
2011-12-09T23:15:02  <antimatroid> i can do my map generator in any language now :D
2011-12-09T23:15:17  <antimatroid> besh: but then you're never actually moving in for the kill?
2011-12-09T23:15:32  <antimatroid> oh, and then attack?
2011-12-09T23:15:40  <besh> i do when the ants at radius + 1 outnumber the opponent
2011-12-09T23:16:05  <besh> otherwise they standoff like the rest of the bots

2011-12-09T23:19:35  <antimatroid> it's probably not such an issue anyway
2011-12-09T23:19:44  <antimatroid> my maze maps are all straight edges otherwise

2011-12-09T23:20:32  <BenJackson> the scenario?
2011-12-09T23:20:49  <antimatroid> McLeopold: look for the conversation antimony and I had above about tracking possible enemies
2011-12-09T23:20:56  <BenJackson> argh another bird in my attic

2011-12-09T23:21:03  <McLeopold> BenJackson: no, your results
2011-12-09T23:22:30  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it looks like a long conversation...
2011-12-09T23:23:22  <antimatroid> start with  antimatroid: are people tracking where possible enemies might be?
2011-12-09T23:23:28  <antimatroid> it doesn't actually extend that entire convo
2011-12-09T23:26:37  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it's basically so you don't need to maximise vision around your hills at all times, just slowly move your possibly enemy perimeter outwards
2011-12-09T23:27:09  <antimatroid> possible* (i'm terriblY at that :P)
2011-12-09T23:27:53  <besh> i want to know how some bots do that. My bots just park an ant close to hill at all times ..
2011-12-09T23:28:00  <Extrarius> that is especially true  in maze maps
2011-12-09T23:28:16  <antimatroid> yeah, this way is quite popular
2011-12-09T23:28:23  <antimatroid> i think
2011-12-09T23:28:56  <McLeopold> It seems like you only need to track 1 number then
2011-12-09T23:29:15  <antimatroid> yeah i just have a bool in each square for if an enemy might reside there
2011-12-09T23:29:24  <McLeopold> and then target unseen squares that are closest to your hill
2011-12-09T23:29:30  <antimatroid> not unseen
2011-12-09T23:29:36  <antimatroid> possible enemy squares
2011-12-09T23:29:44  <antimatroid> sorry
2011-12-09T23:29:55  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so, do you have symmetry detection?
2011-12-09T23:30:01  <antimatroid> i go for unseen first, then later on i worry about possible enemies rather than not visibl
2011-12-09T23:30:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: no
2011-12-09T23:30:12  <antimatroid> antimony does
2011-12-09T23:30:13  <McLeopold> do you want it?
2011-12-09T23:30:16  <antimatroid> no
2011-12-09T23:30:34  <antimatroid> although i'll hear how to do it?
2011-12-09T23:30:49  <McLeopold> I don't know, I just want to figure it out
2011-12-09T23:31:03  <McLeopold> so, ready to figure it out :)
2011-12-09T23:31:15  <antimatroid> read the rest of my convo with antimony then :P
2011-12-09T23:31:18  <McLeopold> I did
2011-12-09T23:31:21  <antimatroid> he outlines some of what he's doing
2011-12-09T23:31:34  <McLeopold> you pulled out your translation formula again :)
2011-12-09T23:31:39  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm a fan :P
2011-12-09T23:32:25  <antimatroid> what i don't know is can one do a fully fair map with translational symmetry and 5 players?
2011-12-09T23:32:30  <antimatroid> you can if it's continuous, but with the grid?
2011-12-09T23:32:55  <McLeopold> what's the difference?
2011-12-09T23:33:14  <antimatroid> a.b.c., that's fully fair because each player has equal access to each of the other players
2011-12-09T23:33:49  <McLeopold> I got a few starting hills to be the same distance in 5 player maps
2011-12-09T23:34:07  <McLeopold> I don't think it is equal, but it's really close
2011-12-09T23:34:36  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if it'd still be perfectly fair

2011-12-09T23:35:00  <antimatroid> symmetric games are complicated, most of my honours thesis this year ended up being on them :P
2011-12-09T23:35:10  <McLeopold> okay, so your first bit of information for map symmetry is the rows and cols
2011-12-09T23:35:10  <antimatroid> but for more general games
2011-12-09T23:35:32  <McLeopold> and the goal will be a set of starting hills with the ant orientations
2011-12-09T23:35:47  <McLeopold> and figuring out the number of players
2011-12-09T23:36:19  <McLeopold> so, the rows and cols give you a limit to the player count
2011-12-09T23:36:22  <antimatroid> if you can match an enemy hill to one of yours that gives you some info about the number of players
2011-12-09T23:36:40  <McLeopold> right, but I'm thinking about before you get that far
2011-12-09T23:37:06  <McLeopold> actually, it doesn't matter
2011-12-09T23:37:12  <antimatroid> the rows and cols give you a set of feasible players actually
2011-12-09T23:37:29  <McLeopold> they give you a min and max, because of the area contraints
2011-12-09T23:37:43  <antimatroid> i think there's divisibility constraints too?
2011-12-09T23:37:52  <McLeopold> plus I think you can eliminate prime number if not a divisor of either dimension?
2011-12-09T23:37:52  <antimatroid> i haven't actually worked out what they are
2011-12-09T23:37:57  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-09T23:37:59  <antimatroid> something like that
2011-12-09T23:38:14  <McLeopold> for 5 players, at least 1 dimension *has* to be 5, right?
2011-12-09T23:38:38  <antimatroid> for translational symmetric i think both have to be divisible by 5?
2011-12-09T23:38:50  <McLeopold> no
2011-12-09T23:38:50  <antimatroid> for the other, you can't have 5 players
2011-12-09T23:39:08  <antimatroid> you need to be able to translate the rows 5 times and get back to the same location
2011-12-09T23:39:12  <antimatroid> it must be divisible by 5 no?
2011-12-09T23:39:24  <McLeopold> well, unless one way you translate 0
2011-12-09T23:39:43  <antimatroid> my map gens don't do that
2011-12-09T23:40:11  <McLeopold> I don't think you can ever eliminate the even number players on any map
2011-12-09T23:40:32  <antimatroid> sure, but you can make sure no two players start in the same row or column

2011-12-09T23:40:48  <McLeopold> okay, but stop assuming your maps :P
2011-12-09T23:40:59  <antimatroid> sorry :P
2011-12-09T23:41:02  <Extrarius> you don't need even players, you need even hills
2011-12-09T23:41:03  <McLeopold> we are working backwards here
2011-12-09T23:41:18  <antimatroid> why do you want symmetry detection?
2011-12-09T23:41:24  <antimatroid> i don't think it's going to help you that much
2011-12-09T23:41:30  <antimatroid> you're much better off improving combat
2011-12-09T23:41:31  <McLeopold> so, you can right away limit the possible player counts
2011-12-09T23:41:45  <antimatroid> what does it matter? just slowly dominate all the things
2011-12-09T23:42:10  <McLeopold> for science!
2011-12-09T23:42:23  <antimatroid> another hint would be instead of just worrying about possible enemies, actively try and push your enemies away from your hills ;)
2011-12-09T23:42:44  <McLeopold> if they all kill each other, you lose on points
2011-12-09T23:42:56  <McLeopold> anyway, let's say you found a hill, what next?
2011-12-09T23:43:21  <antimatroid> you get feasible parameters for each of your hills?
2011-12-09T23:43:29  <McLeopold> if you only started with 1 hills, that tells you alot
2011-12-09T23:43:30  <antimatroid> test them until you find a counter example with water information
2011-12-09T23:43:35  <antimatroid> untill you have 1 hill remaining?
2011-12-09T23:44:19  <McLeopold> but first, can't you again limit the player counts?
2011-12-09T23:44:32  <antimatroid> probably
2011-12-09T23:45:04  <McLeopold> if it is in the same row or column, it might be mirror or rotational
2011-12-09T23:45:11  <antimatroid> are you just working out translationally symmetry here?
2011-12-09T23:45:16  <McLeopold> all of them
2011-12-09T23:45:17  <antimatroid> yeah :P

2011-12-09T23:45:43  <antimatroid> you probably want to keep track of razed hills if you haven't detected symmetry yet too
2011-12-09T23:45:52  <antimatroid> so so messy :P
2011-12-09T23:46:02  <McLeopold> assume you do
2011-12-09T23:46:13  <BenJackson> arrgh no bird in sight once I'm up there
2011-12-09T23:47:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i'd be inclined to keep feasible stuff for translational and the others separately
2011-12-09T23:47:09  <McLeopold> if the player count is 3, 5 or 7 finding the hill is good
2011-12-09T23:47:14  <antimatroid> and rule them all down until only 1 remains
2011-12-09T23:47:19  <antimatroid> anyway, i need to go do some stuff
2011-12-09T23:47:25  <McLeopold> ok
2011-12-09T23:47:26  <BenJackson> McLeopold: http://paste.aichallenge.org/xgTnQ/
2011-12-09T23:48:24  <McLeopold> BenJackson: the first move didn't look to good
2011-12-09T23:49:02  <McLeopold> the second move was the classic "will a volunteer please step forward" and everyone but 1 ant steps back
2011-12-09T23:49:20  <BenJackson> the first is because only the first 2 ranks are "in combat"
2011-12-09T23:49:28  <BenJackson> thus they can't all step back as they'd like
2011-12-09T23:49:36  <BenJackson> which is sort of on purpose
2011-12-09T23:49:48  <BenJackson> if I build up 3 ranks deep it gives the ones in front more intestinal fortitude
2011-12-09T23:50:16  <BenJackson> the lunging of single ants there has to do with winning scenarios that don't happen, like every opposing ant stepping forward
2011-12-09T23:50:31  <BenJackson> that one sacrificial forward ant gets a "touch" on a bunch of enemies
2011-12-09T23:50:37  <BenJackson> of course if they don't then he dies
2011-12-09T23:51:50  <BenJackson> McLeopold: maybe I can recreate the "bad" prior behavior
2011-12-09T23:51:55  <McLeopold> so with 2 lines advancing, sticking a single ant out there is good?
2011-12-09T23:52:59  <BenJackson> bad version where defensive front rotates sideways: http://paste.aichallenge.org/9rRXN/
2011-12-09T23:53:43  <BenJackson> McLeopold: imagine two flat lines 2 deep on each side, 2 apart (so aa..bb but stack that up)
2011-12-09T23:53:55  <BenJackson> now imagine aa all step east so:  aa.bb (but again, stacked up
2011-12-09T23:53:57  <McLeopold> BenJackson: can you get the latest ants.py from github?
2011-12-09T23:54:12  <McLeopold> your map in the replay is the ending state instead of the starting state
2011-12-09T23:54:13  <BenJackson> if one 'b' in the middle steps forward it alters the balance a lot in b's favor

2011-12-09T23:54:28  <BenJackson> because that forward 'b' now touches 5 'a' that are in combat

2011-12-09T23:57:56  <BenJackson> basically that move is due to the fact that I don't weight the likelihood of enemy moves when considering how my moves work out
2011-12-09T23:58:09  <BenJackson> so that "one ant nub" is some super awesome reply to something that won't happen
