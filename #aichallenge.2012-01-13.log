2012-01-13T13:53:57  <a1k0n> jesus christ haskell is driving me crazy
2012-01-13T13:54:07  <a1k0n> i have no idea, i did that one years ago
2012-01-13T13:54:27  <a1k0n> hmm i did it in lua
2012-01-13T13:54:35  <mcstar> lol
2012-01-13T13:54:47  <mcstar> why does haskell drive you crazy?
2012-01-13T13:54:52  <mcstar> cant be worse than lua
2012-01-13T13:54:54  <a1k0n> i generated the primes, then sorted the digits?
2012-01-13T13:55:08  <a1k0n> because it's complaining about Ints not being Integers
2012-01-13T13:55:23  <mcstar> ofc they arent
2012-01-13T13:55:42  <a1k0n> so i ahve to insert 1::Integer all over the place
2012-01-13T13:55:52  <a1k0n> but the current error is totally inscrutable
2012-01-13T13:55:53  <mcstar> i never have to do that
2012-01-13T13:56:03  <a1k0n>     Couldn't match expected type `Integer' with actual type `Int'
2012-01-13T13:56:03  <a1k0n>     Expected type: Integer -> Integer
2012-01-13T13:56:04  <a1k0n>       Actual type: Int -> a0
2012-01-13T13:56:13  <mcstar> can i see the code?
2012-01-13T13:56:53  <a1k0n> http://pastebin.com/NdxTGRqn
2012-01-13T13:57:00  <a1k0n> it's very broken and i am confused
2012-01-13T13:57:48  <a1k0n> does the index to !! have to be Int?
2012-01-13T13:58:13  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-13T13:58:25  <mcstar> but if i remove the Integer constraint it works
2012-01-13T13:58:27  <a1k0n> ok, then it's complaining about the 1 -> line
2012-01-13T13:58:37  <a1k0n> oh.  heh.
2012-01-13T13:58:52  <mcstar> econv :: Int -> Int
2012-01-13T13:58:57  <a1k0n> yes, just removing the type fixes it.  whatever.
2012-01-13T13:59:09  <a1k0n> but that's wrong, since it overflows
2012-01-13T13:59:27  <a1k0n> oh is `div` only valid for Ints?
2012-01-13T13:59:40  <a1k0n> no
2012-01-13T13:59:54  <mcstar> no
2012-01-13T14:00:04  <mcstar> div is the proper Integer division
2012-01-13T14:00:16  <mcstar> '/ converts to float
2012-01-13T14:00:33  <a1k0n> basically it can't handle (n-1) if n is an Int and the result needs to be Integer
2012-01-13T14:00:56  <mcstar> ill compehend your code in a moment
2012-01-13T14:02:34  <a1k0n> mcstar: yeah p49 doesn't necessarily increase by 3330 does it?
2012-01-13T14:02:48  <mcstar> turns out it does
2012-01-13T14:02:54  <a1k0n> oh yes it does
2012-01-13T14:02:57  <mcstar> -necessarily
2012-01-13T14:03:00  <a1k0n> i didn't actually check for it though
2012-01-13T14:03:05  <mcstar> i mean its not clear from the description
2012-01-13T14:03:11  <a1k0n> yeah, it's not
2012-01-13T14:03:12  <mcstar> if i should explicitely check only that
2012-01-13T14:03:40  <mcstar> my solution is the last in the forums
2012-01-13T14:04:05  <a1k0n> i just searched all the 4-digit primes such that p[b]+(p[b]-p[a]) is prime
2012-01-13T14:05:17  <mcstar> your code looks more like lisp than haskell with that many parents
2012-01-13T14:05:40  <a1k0n> i know, but the apply rules in haskell were driving me nuts
2012-01-13T14:05:45  <a1k0n> i still can't figure out wtf is wrong
2012-01-13T14:06:25  <a1k0n> heh it takes 18ms to generate all the 4-digit primes, and then do the above search, in lua
2012-01-13T14:06:53  <mcstar> a1k0n: i cant figure out what your code does
2012-01-13T14:06:57  <a1k0n> exhaustively, too.  it finds both sequences
2012-01-13T14:07:03  <a1k0n> i can't either; that's the problem
2012-01-13T14:07:09  <a1k0n> but anyway it's basically generating a memoized array
2012-01-13T14:07:13  <mcstar> i mean whats the purpose?
2012-01-13T14:07:25  <mcstar> what r you trying to do?
2012-01-13T14:07:34  <a1k0n> generating recurrence of the numerators of convergents of e
2012-01-13T14:07:53  <a1k0n> p65
2012-01-13T14:08:11  <mcstar> first of all i dont use !! for lists
2012-01-13T14:08:35  <mcstar> i mean if i really have to index the data, i convert it to an array
2012-01-13T14:08:42  <mcstar> cause !! has to walk the list...
2012-01-13T14:09:21  <a1k0n> it does?
2012-01-13T14:09:26  <a1k0n> i mean, sure
2012-01-13T14:09:40  <a1k0n> but this is a lazy list
2012-01-13T14:10:05  <a1k0n> doesn't the generated part actually live in an array?  i don't know
2012-01-13T14:10:12  <mcstar> it might not be important in this case, i dont knopw
2012-01-13T14:10:17  <mcstar> it can change the complexity

2012-01-13T14:10:49  <a1k0n> anyway
2012-01-13T14:10:49  <a1k0n>     Couldn't match expected type `Integer' with actual type `Int'
2012-01-13T14:10:50  <a1k0n>     In the first argument of `(-)', namely `n'
2012-01-13T14:10:50  <a1k0n>     In the second argument of `(*)', namely `(n - 1)'
2012-01-13T14:10:50  <a1k0n>     In the first argument of `(*)', namely `(2 * (n - 1))'
2012-01-13T14:10:54  <a1k0n> w t f
2012-01-13T14:11:10  <mcstar> so "econv n" should give e for a given number of decimals?
2012-01-13T14:11:13  <a1k0n> i'm multplying 2(n-1) with an Integer
2012-01-13T14:11:26  <a1k0n> no, not at all
2012-01-13T14:11:43  <a1k0n> it is only the numerator of the convergent, not the fraction
2012-01-13T14:12:06  <a1k0n> each convergent is a successively better rational approximation to e

2012-01-13T14:27:41  <mcstar> but i dont understand the alg. and it is waay far from the way id write it

2012-01-13T14:38:46  <mcstar> well, it should be functionally equivalent
2012-01-13T14:38:54  <a1k0n> seems to work
2012-01-13T14:38:57  <mcstar> im trying to solve #56 now
2012-01-13T14:39:03  <mcstar> 65
2012-01-13T14:39:30  <mcstar> ah, you can delete the trace and the guard
2012-01-13T14:39:31  <a1k0n> is that actually memoized though?  it seems to recurseively combute things
2012-01-13T14:39:48  <mcstar> i didnt change your alg
2012-01-13T14:40:01  <mcstar> !! should be defined like take'
