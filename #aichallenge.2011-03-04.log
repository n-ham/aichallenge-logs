2011-03-04T00:26:42  <Frontier> it should display nothing though...
2011-03-04T00:26:47  <antimatroid1> he okay
2011-03-04T00:26:55  <antimatroid1> i just had an interesting few hours aha
2011-03-04T00:27:26  <antimatroid1> my friend dragged me along to "some information thing about some charity thing", turns out it was a group interview for volunteers positions
2011-03-04T00:27:46  <antimatroid1> so i spent a few hours doing ridiculous things in groups with complete strangers for something i haven no real interest in doing
2011-03-04T00:30:08  <Frontier> oh a recursion -.-
2011-03-04T00:30:39  <Frontier> oh funny situation
2011-03-04T00:31:02  <Frontier> i mean: you were in a funny situation and i had a recursion in my code
2011-03-04T00:33:54  <antimatroid1> :p
2011-03-04T00:34:06  <Frontier> call the web page again, what does it say?
2011-03-04T00:34:23  <antimatroid1> lolz
2011-03-04T00:34:27  <Frontier> 1 call?
2011-03-04T00:34:34  <antimatroid1> ?
2011-03-04T00:34:39  <Frontier> or no message box
2011-03-04T00:35:01  <antimatroid1> no message box?
2011-03-04T00:35:12  <Frontier> is there NO message box when you load the page? Oo
2011-03-04T00:35:17  <antimatroid1> in chrome it keeps part of what was on the window above when i go back to chrome
2011-03-04T00:35:27  <antimatroid1> i just see lolz
2011-03-04T00:36:09  <Frontier> and ie?
2011-03-04T00:37:01  <antimatroid1> ie just shows lolz
2011-03-04T00:37:12  <antimatroid1> no problem with going back to the window and having something left therer
2011-03-04T00:37:16  <Frontier> why doesn't it show a message box :(
2011-03-04T00:37:47  <Frontier> are there errors?
2011-03-04T00:38:48  <antimatroid1> nope
2011-03-04T00:39:08  <antimatroid1> "there should be a message box"
2011-03-04T00:39:24  <Frontier> strange. in opera and ff i see a message box. it means that the applet has been initialized.
2011-03-04T00:40:13  <Frontier> i changed something. is it better now?
2011-03-04T00:41:23  <antimatroid1> finally loaded after 1 calls
2011-03-04T00:41:48  <Frontier> :D allright

2011-03-04T11:48:10  <antimatroid1> when you're painting outwards to find things, don't look on/past a water square

2011-03-04T11:49:56  <antimatroid1> well yeah, but you want to paint outwards when calculating that
2011-03-04T11:50:17  <antimatroid1> it's the fastest and easiest way to do it
2011-03-04T11:51:18  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: i'm back to thinking spawning/battle should be blocked by water, at the very least spawning
2011-03-04T11:51:36  <jmcarthur> this sounds like a rogue-like algorithm
2011-03-04T11:51:48  <jmcarthur> (those are very involved, actually)
2011-03-04T11:52:12  <antimatroid1> spawning should be easiest to change, births are simple: for each food square, paint outwards (not over water) and find ants inside range
2011-03-04T11:52:33  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: it's a queue of locations, it's really simple
2011-03-04T11:52:56  <jmcarthur> simple enough to go in the spec?

2011-03-04T11:53:17  <antimatroid1> the spec doesn't even cover how to calculate what squares you can see
2011-03-04T11:53:20  <jmcarthur> are people going to understand it?

2011-03-04T11:55:30  <jmcarthur> i know this isn't about what's visible, but the same principles apply
2011-03-04T11:55:47  <jmcarthur> if we have water block attacks/spawns, we have to decide in what way they do so
2011-03-04T11:56:11  <antimatroid1> you mean by going "around" water?
2011-03-04T11:56:22  <antimatroid1> i would have allowed that, but i guess it's not intuitive again then
2011-03-04T11:56:37  <jmcarthur> look at the link. maybe read some of the pages describing the algorithms
2011-03-04T11:56:41  <jmcarthur> http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Category:FOV
2011-03-04T11:56:47  <antimatroid1> i understand what you mean
2011-03-04T11:56:58  <jmcarthur> what is the "shape" of a position, for example?
2011-03-04T11:57:16  <antimatroid1> ?
2011-03-04T11:57:40  <jmcarthur> e.g. do you have to be able to see the "center" of a square in order to see it, or can you just see a corner of it?
2011-03-04T11:57:52  <jmcarthur> do you have to see if from your center, or from any part of your square?
2011-03-04T11:57:54  <jmcarthur> etc.
2011-03-04T11:58:18  <antimatroid1> yeah okay
2011-03-04T11:58:20  <jmcarthur> do the corners of square block?
2011-03-04T11:58:24  <jmcarthur> *squares

2011-03-04T11:59:09  <antimatroid1> my very first proposal would have allowed you to go around walls
2011-03-04T11:59:18  <antimatroid1> but that would have been ridiculous
2011-03-04T11:59:32  <antimatroid1> i retract my proposal, that's far too messy
2011-03-04T11:59:52  <antimatroid1> i have better arguments when people raise the issue now though :P
2011-03-04T12:00:01  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-03-04T12:00:20  <jmcarthur> i ran into these same issues when writing my line of sight stuff for my modified tron game idea

2011-03-04T12:03:15  <antimatroid1> oh, and you can have regions blocked off by water, but i think that's bad if you can spawn over water, did we agree on that mcleopold?
2011-03-04T12:03:26  <antimatroid1> or show i allow blocked off regions that people could potentially spawn into
2011-03-04T12:03:33  <antimatroid1> shall*
2011-03-04T12:03:47  <McLeopold> all land should be connected
2011-03-04T12:03:53  <jmcarthur> i think blocked off regions are fine, but you shouldn't be able to spawn into them
2011-03-04T12:04:07  <jmcarthur> you could just flood fill from the ants and make sure they can get to each other
2011-03-04T12:04:22  <jmcarthur> hmm...
2011-03-04T12:04:37  <jmcarthur> blocked off regions could become problematic if you can spawn across them
2011-03-04T12:04:43  <McLeopold> The engine will find all disconnected sections and fill in all but the largest with water.
2011-03-04T12:04:49  <jmcarthur> i guess your opponent could do the same though
2011-03-04T12:04:53  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: water regions can fill themselves now if they want anyway
2011-03-04T12:05:11  <jmcarthur> nah i don't mind spawning into them i think
2011-03-04T12:05:15  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: they could too, but it might lead to fairly dull games if people are separated and not easily able to cross to each other
2011-03-04T12:05:23  <McLeopold> Unless a game is considered over when each disconnected region only has one bot on it.
2011-03-04T12:05:25  <jmcarthur> it would just be in your best interest to get into those regions early
2011-03-04T12:05:37  <antimatroid1> it might not go along with fast games
2011-03-04T12:05:51  <jmcarthur> filling in the blocked off regions sounds good
2011-03-04T12:06:09  <jmcarthur> g2g breakfast
2011-03-04T12:06:13  <antimatroid1> no need for that, it can generate blocked off regions now without having to flood fill them
2011-03-04T12:07:59  <antimatroid1> i haven't actually proved it, but i'm pretty sure at least two players start in the same row or column (possibly both) if rows/gcd(rtranslate, rows) == cols/gcd(ctranslate, cols)

2011-03-04T12:10:01  <antimatroid1> and when at least two players start in the same row or col, if the engine tried to get rtrans and ctrans from two arbitrary players starting positions, it could fail, with my new method, doing it between any two players should always cycle back to the same position after exactly n translations

2011-03-04T12:43:39  <antimatroid1> i'll update the wiki right now, as i need to fix that ordering of info on the last turn too
2011-03-04T12:43:42  <McLeopold> let's stuff that in the spec
2011-03-04T12:43:54  <McLeopold> did you read my new replay format?
2011-03-04T12:45:47  <antimatroid1> no?
2011-03-04T12:46:02  <antimatroid1> i just updated input info and added the .map thing
2011-03-04T12:46:27  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: want to check the sample input on the specs page for me?
2011-03-04T12:48:55  * jmcarthur peeks
2011-03-04T12:48:56  <janzert> McLeopold: it'll take reworking the worker tournament runner and manager
2011-03-04T12:49:26  <janzert> Can you just throw it out of the main sql and add a worker.sql in the worker directory with just the jail_user table for now?
2011-03-04T12:49:56  <janzert> or just reduce the schema.sql that is in the worker directory to just the jail_user table would be fine
2011-03-04T12:50:09  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: looks good to me
2011-03-04T12:50:44  <jmcarthur> if it was up to me the i/o protocol wouldn't have "end" or "players" at all. it would just skip straight to scores
2011-03-04T12:52:41  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: i want the number of players
2011-03-04T12:52:49  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't mind if it was given on the scores line, but i want it
2011-03-04T12:53:12  <antimatroid1> and without end the winner is going to try and make an extra lot of moves
2011-03-04T12:53:21  <antimatroid1> i think end could be instead of go though
2011-03-04T12:53:31  <antimatroid1> rather than instead of turn
2011-03-04T12:53:47  <antimatroid1> it would also make end the last line of input always
2011-03-04T12:54:23  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: if the scores show up then you know the game is over. no need for "end"
2011-03-04T12:54:37  <antimatroid1> true
2011-03-04T12:55:08  <jmcarthur> also, the number of players is implicit from the score
2011-03-04T12:55:10  <antimatroid1> i still want noPlayers somewhere before the actual score values :P
2011-03-04T12:55:23  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: it means more effort for me to handle the input
2011-03-04T12:55:28  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-03-04T12:55:34  <jmcarthur> it's more effort for me with it being there :P
2011-03-04T12:55:41  <antimatroid1> not as much as for me
2011-03-04T12:56:02  <antimatroid1> it's minimal extra effort for you, whereas i need to read a whole line, correctly read the endline then and take stuff out of a stringstream
2011-03-04T12:56:13  <antimatroid1> it's a reasonable amount of extra work, i imagine c could be even worse?
2011-03-04T12:56:27  <jmcarthur> that's not true. you can read the line incrementally
2011-03-04T12:56:37  <jmcarthur> just take scores until you hit an endline
2011-03-04T12:56:53  <antimatroid1> hmmm, maybe?
2011-03-04T12:57:03  <jmcarthur> it's what i was doing before my parser rewrite
2011-03-04T12:57:28  <jmcarthur> now i'm just grabbing lines from stdin whole and then going over them again
2011-03-04T12:57:54  <antimatroid1> i'd still prefer to just get given the number of players, it also means i can create the vector and read values straight in, rather than read a value somewhere and add it to the vector :P
2011-03-04T12:57:56  <jmcarthur> anyway, i have to go. i will be back later

2011-03-04T13:05:12  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: jmcarthur is right, end is redundant, i think that should go back to turn, if you really wanted, replace the last go with end
2011-03-04T13:08:58  <janzert> McLeopold: I don't believe sqlite will do proper locking which is all we're actually using the database for
2011-03-04T13:11:30  <McLeopold> it will
2011-03-04T13:11:32  <janzert> just get rid of it from the main sql files and you don't need to even touch anything about it in the worker stuff for now
2011-03-04T13:12:41  <McLeopold> janzert: how did you generate maps before?  on the server, then copy them to the workers?
2011-03-04T13:13:12  <janzert> actually locally then commit them to svn and check them out on all the servers
2011-03-04T13:13:23  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: end is redundant in this game, but maybe not for all games
2011-03-04T13:13:34  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-03-04T13:14:27  <McLeopold> I think I'll just write an api.php page for getting the map
2011-03-04T13:14:52  <janzert> yeah, that would be pretty easy and be better
2011-03-04T13:15:01  <McLeopold> k
2011-03-04T13:15:03  <janzert> keep the maps out of the repository all together
2011-03-04T13:15:34  <janzert> you'll notice I moved the maps and submission directories out of the repository area in the worker build script
2011-03-04T13:15:43  <McLeopold> so, I'm not going to touch the worker directory.  but anything db related can be taken out
2011-03-04T13:17:47  <janzert> the worker directory has it's own schema.sql so you can get rid of the jail_user stuff from the main  schema file in the sql directory without any changes needed to the worker
2011-03-04T13:17:48  <McLeopold> janzert: what is los_data?
2011-03-04T13:18:01  <janzert> likely hood of superiority
2011-03-04T13:18:20  <McLeopold> what's it for?
2011-03-04T13:18:21  <janzert> something bayeselo could give you but was much to expensive to generate during the contest

2011-03-04T13:18:58  <janzert> gives you a matrix for the likelihood of any bot being superior to any other given bot

2011-03-04T13:20:08  <McLeopold> It doesn't look like we need the file.  It doesn't really hook into anything
2011-03-04T13:20:09  <janzert> I don't know the statistics behind it but I think it's generally over confident though
2011-03-04T13:20:45  <janzert> McLeopold: since bayeselo is going away it won't be useful at all
2011-03-04T13:21:09  <janzert> i.e. yes it can go away
2011-03-04T13:21:30  <McLeopold> well, we may do the next one with beyeselo, so I really want to know if it was a needed part of the system, and how we used the results
2011-03-04T13:22:02  <janzert> the results were just served as a static file and posted in the forums is all
2011-03-04T13:22:14  <janzert> not an integral part of the system in any way
2011-03-04T13:22:22  <McLeopold> ok, thx
2011-03-04T13:22:59  <janzert> just bayeselo author recommended it as better than using confidence intervals to help gauge superiority
2011-03-04T13:24:30  <janzert> just looking at the new sql file...
2011-03-04T13:24:50  <janzert> it looks like countries.sql and user_status.sql should just go away
2011-03-04T13:25:51  <janzert> but I think the organization data should be moved kept in organizations.sql permanently and moved out of the schema file
2011-03-04T13:26:25  <janzert> since this will hopefully be directly changeable through the website
2011-03-04T13:27:08  <janzert> although the Other organization should probably stay in the schema since there is code that directly depends not only on it existing but also being organization 0
2011-03-04T13:27:39  <McLeopold> janzert: for a submission, we have active, latest and cleanup_status.  I'm guessing there is some redundancy there.
2011-03-04T13:28:40  <janzert> I don't actually remember what active is used for
2011-03-04T13:28:41  <McLeopold> janzert: okay, I'll do the split of the main_sql file
2011-03-04T13:28:50  <McLeopold> it looks like latest?
2011-03-04T13:29:23  <janzert> latest is used a lot of places to filter for just the submissions currently in use

2011-03-04T13:30:13  <janzert> cleanup_status is used by the cleanup_script to mark old submissions after they've been deleted
2011-03-04T13:30:50  <McLeopold> I want to add a version field, that would start at 1 for each user
2011-03-04T13:31:01  <McLeopold> I think I'll get rid of active and cleanup_status
2011-03-04T13:31:22  <McLeopold> I'm re-writing delete_some_old... right now.
2011-03-04T13:31:36  <janzert> getting rid of cleanup_status is my first instinct but there are some advantages to splitting it out of status
2011-03-04T13:32:29  <McLeopold> what are they?
2011-03-04T13:32:50  <McLeopold> wait, status is for compiling status and such?
2011-03-04T13:32:54  <janzert> if you fold cleanup_status into the general status code you lose the ability to tell if the submission was ever successfully submitted, compiled, etc

2011-03-04T13:34:16  <janzert> yeah, it could
2011-03-04T13:34:48  <janzert> the idea was to leave a few old submissions from each person so you could do forensics on them if needed

2011-03-04T13:35:50  <janzert> cleanup_status is really just a way of not doing a directory listing though so seems unneeded
2011-03-04T13:37:03  <janzert> I think the current script approaches the problem from the wrong direction basically

2011-03-04T13:42:49  <janzert> and if they did it would be simple to kill it and start up a new one
2011-03-04T13:43:19  <McLeopold> I think it would be better if a worker can stay up as long as possible.
2011-03-04T13:43:20  <janzert> don't over extend yourself right off :)
2011-03-04T13:43:33  <janzert> workers are expendable :P
2011-03-04T13:49:47  <McLeopold> but spinup time can be costly
2011-03-04T13:50:18  <janzert> somewhat yes, but once a week or so isn't that big of a cost
2011-03-04T13:51:03  <McLeopold> semaphore_cleanup is workers only?
2011-03-04T13:51:19  <janzert> not until compilation is moved to the workers
2011-03-04T13:51:49  <McLeopold> it uses the jail users
2011-03-04T13:51:57  <McLeopold> so the main server had jail users too?
2011-03-04T13:52:09  <janzert> yeah, it used to
2011-03-04T13:52:34  <Zannick> the main server used to be the only server, i believe
2011-03-04T13:52:59  <janzert> right
2011-03-04T13:53:49  <janzert> for the first few weeks of planetwars and always before that
2011-03-04T13:55:24  <McLeopold> so, the pairing_cutoff is the lowest rank that will be considered for matchups?
2011-03-04T13:55:43  <janzert> yes
2011-03-04T13:56:01  <McLeopold> it's going in the database now

2011-03-04T14:32:34  <McLeopold> I've fixed it in a few places.
2011-03-04T14:32:57  <McLeopold> so Ubuntu must default to on
2011-03-04T14:33:08  <amstan> assume it's off, that way it'll work either way
2011-03-04T14:33:12  <McLeopold> Which the server_build script ought to turn off
2011-03-04T14:33:46  <McLeopold> is the php code suppose to create the directory?  all I see is a commented out mkdir?
2011-03-04T14:33:53  <McLeopold> a new submission
2011-03-04T14:34:59  <McLeopold> nvm, I just saw the "hidden" database error
2011-03-04T14:35:07  <janzert> it's written weird but I believe it does

2011-03-04T16:43:12  <amstan> McLeopold: that's fine, we can make the makefile add them
2011-03-04T16:43:15  <McLeopold> or at least it was exceptable to do so
2011-03-04T16:44:25  <McLeopold> I'm talking about submissions and looking at the compile_daemon unzipping part
2011-03-04T16:45:40  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, it's acceptable to upload anything
2011-03-04T16:45:47  <jmcarthur> IMO there should be a subdirectory in the starter packs which is what is actually submitted
2011-03-04T16:45:58  <jmcarthur> it would be a little nicer, at least
2011-03-04T16:46:49  <McLeopold> yes it would

2011-03-04T16:49:02  <McLeopold> if they are writing code, that is unavoidable
2011-03-04T16:49:20  <Zannick> or we make them download two separate zips
2011-03-04T16:49:24  <McLeopold> if they just download the starter pack and upload it, as per the guide, we can change the guide
2011-03-04T16:49:40  <McLeopold> Zannick: that's the better idea
2011-03-04T16:50:18  <McLeopold> python.zip and tools.zip, experts can unpack python.zip into the tools dir

2011-03-04T17:21:25  <Zannick> :(
2011-03-04T17:21:44  <McLeopold> For some reason I thought I was only operating in the 'c' dir.
2011-03-04T17:24:20  <Frontier> yeah this is not svn

2011-03-04T17:45:25  <contestbot> McLeopold: OK
2011-03-04T17:55:43  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: you had a lot of changes when you did that reset --hard...
2011-03-04T17:57:23  <jmcarthur> i would have done 'git stash; git pull; git stash apply'
2011-03-04T17:57:24  <jmcarthur> or something to that effect
2011-03-04T17:57:24  <_flag> amstan: The starter pack is ready.
2011-03-04T17:57:24  <jmcarthur> i hate that git doesn't like you pulling a lot of the time when you have uncommited changes
2011-03-04T17:57:24  <jmcarthur> git stash apply would have probably had some conflicts, but at least then it would have just been a matter of cleaning them up

2011-03-04T17:59:39  <Zannick> hm
2011-03-04T17:59:48  <Zannick> it was probably just something weird with the folder itself
2011-03-04T18:00:33  <Zannick> i would have tried rmdir it, then pull
2011-03-04T18:00:36  <Zannick> or pull -f
2011-03-04T18:01:05  <Zannick> though those might not have worked either
2011-03-04T18:01:49  <jmcarthur> oh i see
2011-03-04T18:01:59  <McLeopold> at least I had that git status in a command window
2011-03-04T18:02:14  <McLeopold> it isn't looking as bad as it felt
2011-03-04T18:02:22  <jmcarthur> so the issue was that you had some local C stuff and then needed to merge in flag's stuff?
2011-03-04T18:02:23  <McLeopold> but know I know, git stash is my friend
2011-03-04T18:02:39  <McLeopold> yeah, I just wanted to pull the 'c' dir changes
2011-03-04T18:03:01  <Zannick> so now you can point to this and say "i learned the hard way about git reset --hard"? ;)
2011-03-04T18:03:16  <McLeopold> I didn't actually have changes in 'c' that should have caused an issue.
2011-03-04T18:03:27  <Zannick> but did you make the folder yourself?
2011-03-04T18:03:59  <McLeopold> if you look at the status, it says the directory itself was untracked?  but I thought git didn't track directories
2011-03-04T18:04:03  <jmcarthur> yeah it looked like that wasn't even a part of the repo
2011-03-04T18:04:09  <jmcarthur> it doesn't, but it pretends to
2011-03-04T18:04:15  <Zannick> submodules are weird in git
2011-03-04T18:04:29  <jmcarthur> if it's tracking a file, it says it's tracking the directory the file is in
2011-03-04T18:04:48  <jmcarthur> submodules are weird in any VCS
2011-03-04T18:04:53  <Zannick> i think they use different commands
2011-03-04T18:04:55  <Zannick> git submodule init or somesuch
2011-03-04T18:05:02  <jmcarthur> IMO, there isn't much point in them if things are properly packaged as libraries and stuff
2011-03-04T18:06:05  <McLeopold> so is there a better way to do what I wanted, which was ignore the errors from the pull only?
2011-03-04T18:06:17  <McLeopold> line 71 of my pastebin
2011-03-04T18:06:33  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: let me make sure i understand things right first
2011-03-04T18:06:45  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: was the 'c' directory something of your own creation that just wasn't in the repo?
2011-03-04T18:06:46  <Zannick> McLeopold: i would only know if i understood the error itself
2011-03-04T18:07:33  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: or maybe more explicitly, were any of the files in it not in the repo *and* named the same as one of the new files in flag's commit?
2011-03-04T18:10:11  <McLeopold> no, it was in the repo
2011-03-04T18:10:22  <McLeopold> I created it, added all the files and check it in awhile ago
2011-03-04T18:10:37  <McLeopold> amstan removed the dir, and put a submodule in its place
2011-03-04T18:11:05  <jmcarthur> i don't see the dir in the tree before amstan's commit
2011-03-04T18:11:15  <jmcarthur> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/cbe9a4dba22a80bc8a4adf57a613bea46c597b6a/ants/bots
2011-03-04T18:11:23  <jmcarthur> so amstan didn't remove it
2011-03-04T18:11:38  <McLeopold> oh, so I guess I didn't add it
2011-03-04T18:11:41  <jmcarthur> still, if it was checked in then it shouldn't have been a problem
2011-03-04T18:12:13  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: if it was checked in then a git reset --hard would have left it there, too
2011-03-04T18:12:42  <jmcarthur> s/checked in/commited/
2011-03-04T18:13:07  <Zannick> s/checked in/pushed to remote HEAD/
2011-03-04T18:13:23  <jmcarthur> no, wouldn't need to be
2011-03-04T18:13:43  <Zannick> oh, i figured that was what reset did
2011-03-04T18:13:47  <Zannick> not local head
2011-03-04T18:13:47  <jmcarthur> if it had to be pushed then that would defeat the purpose of a DVCS anyway
2011-03-04T18:13:59  <jmcarthur> git reset --hard HEAD resets to the local HEAD
2011-03-04T18:14:18  <jmcarthur> i assume without the HEAD it does the same
2011-03-04T18:14:21  * Zannick still mostly new to git
2011-03-04T18:15:00  <jmcarthur> you would have to say something like git reset --hard remotes/epsilon to reset to the remote HEAD
2011-03-04T18:15:00  <McLeopold> I would have been okay if eclipse wasn't set to auto load changed files.
2011-03-04T18:15:10  <jmcarthur> doh!
2011-03-04T18:15:24  <jmcarthur> well there are two ways this could have been prevented
2011-03-04T18:15:28  <jmcarthur> git stash is one of them
2011-03-04T18:15:29  <McLeopold> I was pretty freaky to switch back to code I was writting and see it disappear
2011-03-04T18:15:44  <Zannick> ouch
2011-03-04T18:15:52  <jmcarthur> the other is: your work should have been in a different branch from your master, and you should only pull remote commits to your master

2011-03-04T18:16:17  <Zannick> jmcarthur: the third is knowing not to use reset --hard unless you're really really sure ;)
2011-03-04T18:16:30  <jmcarthur> Zannick: that's the rule of thumb yes
2011-03-04T18:16:30  <McLeopold> so, why didn't my "untracked" files show up in the list of untracked files in the git status?
2011-03-04T18:16:43  <jmcarthur> i have no freaking clue
2011-03-04T18:16:54  <jmcarthur> i stopped using git a couple years ago :)
2011-03-04T18:17:17  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: what had you added to .gitignore?
2011-03-04T18:17:25  <McLeopold> server_info.py
2011-03-04T18:17:40  <McLeopold> should be specific to the environment
2011-03-04T18:18:05  <McLeopold> luckly I kept the files I didn't git add
2011-03-04T18:18:37  <McLeopold> which still leaves a mystery with the 'c' dir
2011-03-04T18:19:22  * jmcarthur checks out the tree from before flag's stuff and tries to set up the same situation
2011-03-04T18:20:28  <amstan> McLeopold: you ok then?
2011-03-04T18:21:01  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: huh, i checked out cbe9a4dba22a80bc8a4adf57a613bea46c597b6a, made a c directory, moved into it, touched a file called "foo", and it doesn't show up in git status
2011-03-04T18:21:05  <amstan> McLeopold: don't do this: C:\Users\scott\git\aichallenge\ants\bots\c>git add .
2011-03-04T18:22:07  <amstan> McLeopold: you don't actually want to add the files from inside the submodule
2011-03-04T18:22:10  <McLeopold> amstan: you told me too
2011-03-04T18:22:16  <amstan> what? when?
2011-03-04T18:22:23  <jmcarthur> amstan: that wasn't within the submodule
2011-03-04T18:22:27  <McLeopold> 2011-03-04T17:13:08  <amstan> McLeopold: git add ., git reset --hard

2011-03-04T18:24:12  <Zannick> i think amstan was suggesting adding all untracked files, committing them, and resetting
2011-03-04T18:24:29  <amstan> Zannick: no... he asked how he can pull without caring about his changes..
2011-03-04T18:24:38  <McLeopold> he missed the git commit in his instructions then
2011-03-04T18:24:59  <McLeopold> yeah, but I meant not caring what the pull would clobber
2011-03-04T18:25:00  <Zannick> well, i don't know what the point of the add was, then
2011-03-04T18:25:02  <amstan> Zannick: you just add them to the index, then reset them, that way everything will be nothing to commit (working directory clean)

2011-03-04T18:29:14  <jmcarthur> also, if you do 'cd ..; git status' it shows the 'c' directory
2011-03-04T18:29:22  <Zannick> if there are no tracked files but files exist, instead of listing any, it lists the directory only
2011-03-04T18:29:27  <amstan> jmcarthur: yes.. that's why it's a submodule

2011-03-04T19:12:18  <jmcarthur> so i guess some time tomorrow i will be re-adding that stuff...
2011-03-04T19:12:27  <jmcarthur> i was so confused!
2011-03-04T19:27:22  <pyro-> = continuation passing style?
2011-03-04T19:28:00  <jmcarthur> yesh
2011-03-04T19:28:24  <pyro-> you were writing it that way manually?
2011-03-04T19:28:57  <jmcarthur> i have a pretty large monad transformer stack. sticking a bit Cont monad on top of it means it can avoid inspecting a lot of intermediate values
2011-03-04T19:29:06  <jmcarthur> no, the cont monad gets rid of most of the need to do it manually
2011-03-04T19:29:14  <jmcarthur> *sticking a big

2011-03-04T19:29:50  <pyro-> one day i will understand what is these monad things :D
2011-03-04T19:30:05  <jmcarthur> and anyway, manual CPS isn't that hard
2011-03-04T19:30:13  <pyro-> i didn't find any reasonable explaination on the internet yet :|
2011-03-04T19:30:13  <jmcarthur> the type system pretty makes guarantees you can't mess up
2011-03-04T19:30:29  <jmcarthur> you don't need an explanation. you use them all the time and don't even know it
2011-03-04T19:30:32  <pyro-> but its ugly and silly 'cause it can be done automatically?
2011-03-04T19:30:51  <jmcarthur> it's ugly and silly unless you're trying to superoptimize (i'm not)
2011-03-04T19:31:06  <jmcarthur> but even then
2011-03-04T19:31:12  <jmcarthur> ghc is pretty good at figuring it out foryou
2011-03-04T19:31:14  <jmcarthur> *for you

2011-03-04T19:31:38  <pyro-> many scheme implementations tend to use cps under the hood (i.e. for everything)
2011-03-04T19:31:39  <jmcarthur> it's really just this one specific case that i *know* ghc isn't catching
2011-03-04T19:32:08  <pyro-> and its a common case? :(
2011-03-04T19:32:11  <jmcarthur> because it's basically that without CPS it's doing tons of conditional branches
2011-03-04T19:32:17  <jmcarthur> nah not a common case
2011-03-04T19:32:21  <pyro-> :D
2011-03-04T19:33:11  <jmcarthur> basically just free monads (monads derived from tree-like structures that have branches most of the time)
2011-03-04T19:33:51  <pyro-> incomprehensible words ^ D:
2011-03-04T19:34:30  <jmcarthur> here's a very loose explanation
2011-03-04T19:34:40  <jmcarthur> say you need to concatenate a ton of lists
2011-03-04T19:34:43  <jmcarthur> linked lists, i mean

2011-03-04T19:35:07  <jmcarthur> if you associate the concatenation wrong, you end up traversing the accumulated list over and over every time you append another list
2011-03-04T19:35:30  <pyro-> yes
2011-03-04T19:35:31  <jmcarthur> the same kind of thing can happen with tree-like monads in the "bind" operation
2011-03-04T19:35:52  <jmcarthur> applying the ContT transformer to that monad enforces the proper associativity to make it just one pass

2011-03-04T19:37:05  <jmcarthur> heh, i'm not even familiar with that @ and := stuff
2011-03-04T19:37:21  <McLeopold> I'm gonna start with old submissions being removed after 2 days
2011-03-04T19:37:37  <McLeopold> that stuff is mysql specific, it's giving me a unique counter
2011-03-04T19:37:41  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-04T19:37:46  <McLeopold> so, the seq is just counting from 1
2011-03-04T19:37:59  <McLeopold> the rank is counting from 1 only if it is a latest submission
2011-03-04T19:38:18  <McLeopold> so we can pepper the list with retired bots
2011-03-04T19:38:36  <jmcarthur> okay i get it
2011-03-04T19:39:49  <jmcarthur> yeah that query is kind of blowing my mind right now
2011-03-04T19:40:04  <McLeopold> sql is a strong point of mine
2011-03-04T19:40:08  <janzert> it may eventually be better performance to look at the submissions currently still around and then see which ones qualify for deletion
2011-03-04T19:41:00  <McLeopold> janzert: this is for a ranking snapshot, what are you trying to do?
2011-03-04T19:41:30  <janzert> ahh I thought you were working deleting old submissions
2011-03-04T19:42:13  <McLeopold> no, that was easy, get list of dirs, get list of latest, do a diff
2011-03-04T19:42:29  <McLeopold> python magical sets
2011-03-04T19:42:39  <janzert> yep, so long as you're not trying to save any old versions
2011-03-04T19:42:49  <McLeopold> are we?
2011-03-04T19:43:07  <McLeopold> only the latest get matches, right?
2011-03-04T19:43:13  <janzert> we were before but I don't think we ever had a situation that we needed it
2011-03-04T19:43:26  <McLeopold> well, the delete can then just be an archive
2011-03-04T19:43:45  <McLeopold> or, we just don't run the script
2011-03-04T19:43:59  <janzert> that'd be fine as long as your archive system doesn't get overloaded too
2011-03-04T19:44:01  <janzert> :)
2011-03-04T19:44:11  <McLeopold> how much space will the server have?
2011-03-04T19:44:50  <janzert> that's the only reason they started getting deleted in the first place a directory on whatever filesystem the server is using could only hand 16bits worth of entries apparently
2011-03-04T19:45:55  <McLeopold> I didn't think about that...
2011-03-04T19:46:34  <McLeopold> we'll track versions this time, so we can archive to version directories, then there will only be as many dirs as their are contestants
2011-03-04T19:46:50  <janzert> that would work fine
2011-03-04T19:47:11  <McLeopold> also, if we want users to be able to revert to versions, we would need to keep them
2011-03-04T19:47:14  <janzert> so long as we don't get over 4x growth at least
2011-03-04T19:47:29  <janzert> or right around 4 times anyway
2011-03-04T19:47:58  <Zannick> eg. $user/$submission
2011-03-04T19:48:05  <janzert> ugh, right around 8 times rather
2011-03-04T19:48:45  <McLeopold> how about $user_id/%version
2011-03-04T19:48:59  <McLeopold> I don't know what that % means...
2011-03-04T19:49:26  <janzert> 8 times growth seems like it would be pretty unlikely although just barely possible
2011-03-04T19:49:50  <McLeopold> I think ants is a crappier game, so you might just stay even
2011-03-04T19:50:07  <McLeopold> Unless Frontier pulls off the best visualizer ever.
2011-03-04T19:50:27  <janzert> that wouldn't really surprise me too much either
2011-03-04T19:50:34  <Zannick> if we're really worried about running out of space for users, we could hash the username to something from a small set, like [a-z]{4}, then use $hash/$user/$version
2011-03-04T19:50:45  <janzert> actually it would surprise me much less than >8x growth
2011-03-04T19:53:08  <McLeopold> Zannick: how does that help if we want to keep all submissions?
2011-03-04T19:53:33  <Zannick> McLeopold: reduces the number of entries at each level
2011-03-04T19:53:58  <Zannick> the problem in pw was one directory had X subdirectories, for X > max_entries
2011-03-04T19:54:04  <McLeopold> oh, so you're just making the dir tree look nicer
2011-03-04T19:55:07  <McLeopold> so, I got another git question
2011-03-04T19:55:31  <McLeopold> I've made a bunch of changes, and I want to turn all of it into a branch.
2011-03-04T19:55:45  <jmcarthur> git stash; git checkout -b mybranch; git stash apply
2011-03-04T19:56:05  <jmcarthur> there are other ways
2011-03-04T19:56:07  <McLeopold> then a commit
2011-03-04T19:56:12  <jmcarthur> but lacking documentation, that's how i'd do it
2011-03-04T19:56:16  <jmcarthur> yes, then commit
2011-03-04T19:56:39  <jmcarthur> there's probably one command for making a new branch with current changed
2011-03-04T19:56:50  <jmcarthur> git checkout -b mybranch might even do it, but i don't know
2011-03-04T19:56:58  <jmcarthur> s/changed/changes/
2011-03-04T19:58:45  <McLeopold> should I git add new files first?
2011-03-04T19:59:05  <jmcarthur> don't know. doesn't hurt
2011-03-04T20:00:27  <Zannick> git stash; git stash branch <branchname> ?
2011-03-04T20:01:55  <jmcarthur> git makes me sad
2011-03-04T20:03:04  <Zannick> does stash stash commits or just local uncommitted changes?
2011-03-04T20:03:53  <jmcarthur> local uncommitted changes. i'm not sure what you mean by stashing commits anyway
2011-03-04T20:04:09  <jmcarthur> if you want to bring commits to a new branch you just make the new branch
2011-03-04T20:04:21  <Zannick> i guess that doesn't make sense
2011-03-04T20:04:21  <McLeopold> the files are modified, but not committed
2011-03-04T20:04:33  <McLeopold> because I don't want to commit them to the current branch
2011-03-04T20:04:39  <jmcarthur> stash holds on to them and resets them locally
2011-03-04T20:04:52  <Zannick> i always think of my repo as diffed against remote
2011-03-04T20:04:54  <jmcarthur> every time you do 'git stash' it pushes local changes to a stack
2011-03-04T20:05:18  <jmcarthur> and git stash apply applies the changes at the top of the stack
2011-03-04T20:05:19  <Zannick> McLeopold: so i believe git stash; git stash branch <branchname> will do the right thing
2011-03-04T20:05:49  <Zannick> but, uh.
2011-03-04T20:06:56  <jmcarthur> in darcs i would just commit the changes and not push them upstream
2011-03-04T20:06:57  <Zannick> it looks like that does a git stash pop, which discards the stash after it's applied
2011-03-04T20:06:57  <jmcarthur> that would be okay
2011-03-04T20:06:57  <jmcarthur> so long as the changes are left locally
2011-03-04T20:07:00  <Zannick> "Creates and checks out a new branch named <branchname> starting from the commit at which the <stash> was originally created, applies the changes recorded in <stash> to the new working tree and index."
2011-03-04T20:07:13  <jmcarthur> that doesn't sound like it pops...
2011-03-04T20:07:22  <Zannick> "If that succeeds, and <stash> is a reference of the form stash@{<revision>}, it then drops the <stash>. When no <stash> is given, applies the latest one."
2011-03-04T20:07:25  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-04T20:07:39  <jmcarthur> ambiguous
2011-03-04T20:08:13  <Zannick> i just read the docs
2011-03-04T20:08:18  <jmcarthur> if taken literally, i would assume that it doesn't drop the stash unless you specify which one
2011-03-04T20:08:32  <Zannick> oh, hm.
2011-03-04T20:08:38  <jmcarthur> but git docs kind of suck anyway
2011-03-04T20:08:47  <jmcarthur> so much knowledge assumed of the reader already
2011-03-04T20:09:03  <Zannick> well, one could try that command
2011-03-04T20:09:17  <Zannick> then commit and switch back to the first branch
2011-03-04T20:09:20  <Zannick> and git stash show
2011-03-04T20:09:36  <Zannick> to see if it's still there

2011-03-04T20:47:28  <pyro-> the engine sends no information regarding either foggyness or land so to detirmine what is actually land and what is unkown i must manually calculate which squares are in view?
2011-03-04T20:51:19  <pyro-> as far as i can see from just a glance all of the ants bots in the repo simply assume stuff is land if no information is given about it. correct me if im wrong but in fact we dont know if they are ants or land? am confused
2011-03-04T21:01:02  <McLeopold> pyro-: that is correct
2011-03-04T21:01:27  <McLeopold> if you don't know, assume land

2011-03-04T22:15:11  <amriedle> looks like drugs to me
2011-03-04T22:15:29  <amriedle> doesn't mean anything without context :)
2011-03-04T22:15:31  <antimatroid1> they're symmetric
2011-03-04T22:15:41  <antimatroid1> they're my current maps for my mapgen for ants
2011-03-04T22:15:44  <amstan> McLeopold: i was going over the log... you don't necessary need git stash
2011-03-04T22:15:52  <antimatroid1> . = land, % = water, a-z = ant
2011-03-04T22:16:07  <amriedle> amstan: git stash is a nice feature
2011-03-04T22:17:16  <antimatroid1> j3camero: I want you to see these too, http://codepad.org/gD0VHAVH
2011-03-04T22:17:26  <antimatroid1> that kind of symmetry looks way less aweful than the previous ones i had
2011-03-04T22:17:34  <antimatroid1> awful*
2011-03-04T22:18:06  <amstan> antimatroid1: he's not here..
2011-03-04T22:18:34  <antimatroid1> his username is on the right,meh :P
2011-03-04T22:18:37  <amstan> antimatroid1: what symmetry?
2011-03-04T22:18:49  <antimatroid1> amstan: each player starts with the same outlook
2011-03-04T22:18:52  <amstan> antimatroid1: it is.. but he probably forgot about his screen session and will close it
2011-03-04T22:19:00  <antimatroid1> if you come across an enemy at the start, it's done so asymmetrically
2011-03-04T22:19:34  <amstan> antimatroid1: i don't get it..
2011-03-04T22:19:54  <antimatroid1> look at the water around each a-z square for each map, it's the same for each of them
2011-03-04T22:21:06  <amriedle> should i call up rogers once again and complain about my shitty internet speed
2011-03-04T22:21:07  <amstan> umm
2011-03-04T22:21:12  <amstan> amriedle: yes
2011-03-04T22:21:22  <amriedle> it will be the 3rd time in 2 months lol
2011-03-04T22:21:24  <amstan> amriedle: i have ipv6 support now actually
2011-03-04T22:21:24  <antimatroid1> amstan: ?
2011-03-04T22:21:36  <amstan> antimatroid1: i see, you have it kinda tiled
2011-03-04T22:21:48  <antimatroid1> yes, it's tesselated
2011-03-04T22:22:14  <amstan> antimatroid1: though.. i don't think wrapping is a good idea, what about non wrapping maps?
2011-03-04T22:22:23  <antimatroid1> basically it's finding rows, cols, trans, ctrans and noPlayers such that if you take any location, translate it by rtrans and ctrans noPlayers times you get back to the same location
2011-03-04T22:22:48  <antimatroid1> you don't think wrapping is a good idea?
2011-03-04T22:22:54  <amstan> it's rather confusing
2011-03-04T22:22:56  <antimatroid1> everything is set up around the game having wrapped edges
2011-03-04T22:23:05  <antimatroid1> and it is surprisingly well suited to symmetry
2011-03-04T22:23:10  <amstan> why can't you have a non wrapping map?
2011-03-04T22:23:19  <antimatroid1> how is it confusing? you walk off the top, you come out on the bottom
2011-03-04T22:23:23  <amstan> you can easily fit 8 players in it, symmetrical
2011-03-04T22:23:39  <antimatroid1> not as easily
2011-03-04T22:23:54  <antimatroid1> and this can do any number of players
2011-03-04T22:24:24  <amstan> antimatroid1: well.. still.. what about non wrapping maps?
2011-03-04T22:24:34  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid1: wait.. what?
2011-03-04T22:24:45  <amstan> computerwiz_222: maps wrap: http://codepad.org/gD0VHAVH
2011-03-04T22:24:47  <computerwiz_222> how do you walk off the top and coe out the bottom?
2011-03-04T22:24:48  <antimatroid1> what about them? they could be done, but wrapped maps are cooler
2011-03-04T22:25:00  <antimatroid1> computerwiz_222: the edges are wrapped
2011-03-04T22:25:10  <computerwiz_222> ah okay, maked sense
2011-03-04T22:25:10  <amstan> antimatroid1: yeah.. i do like your teselation, i'm just saying that the other ones shouldn't be misrepresented
2011-03-04T22:25:12  <computerwiz_222> makes*
2011-03-04T22:25:30  <antimatroid1> amstan: i thought everyone had agreed on wrapped maps :\
2011-03-04T22:25:32  <amstan> antimatroid1: remember what happened last time when ppl didn't account for a type of map
2011-03-04T22:25:50  <amstan> antimatroid1: it's not an extra variable to make it non-wrappable
2011-03-04T22:25:56  <amstan> antimatroid1: you just have to surround it by a wall
2011-03-04T22:26:08  <antimatroid1> yeah i know, i'll whack one together at some point
2011-03-04T22:26:17  <antimatroid1> but playing in a torus is way cooler
2011-03-04T22:26:21  <antimatroid1> on*
2011-03-04T22:27:08  <amstan> antimatroid1: http://pastebin.com/5rp0KKtj
2011-03-04T22:27:39  <amstan> antimatroid1: also.. wrapped around one axis..
2011-03-04T22:28:05  <antimatroid1> you could wrap top left to bottom right and play on a mobius strip
2011-03-04T22:28:42  <amstan> antimatroid1: umm.. what?
2011-03-04T22:29:11  <jbroman_> I demand Klein bottle maps.
2011-03-04T22:29:17  *** jbroman_ is now known as jbroman
2011-03-04T22:29:28  <amstan> antimatroid1: you're changing the engine then, if you have to reflect the wrapping
2011-03-04T22:29:29  <antimatroid1> amstan: that's how you make a mobius strip, you can do it with a piece of paper if you like
2011-03-04T22:29:38  <antimatroid1> amstan: it was a joke :P
2011-03-04T22:29:44  <amstan> oh, right..
2011-03-04T22:30:11  <antimatroid1> that would be awful to calculate locations from after translating too
2011-03-04T22:30:36  <antimatroid1> you would probably want to make your own % operation :\
2011-03-04T22:30:44  <antimatroid1> anyway, bbs going to work out lunch
2011-03-04T22:31:00  <amstan> antimatroid1: have both axis mirror when you wrap
2011-03-04T22:31:01  <Zannick> well, we could make 1xn maps
2011-03-04T22:31:05  <amstan> antimatroid1: that'll mess you up
2011-03-04T22:31:10  <Zannick> they're functionally mobius strips
2011-03-04T22:31:10  <antimatroid1> say what?
2011-03-04T22:31:23  <Zannick> amstan: that's a klein bottle
2011-03-04T22:31:27  <amstan> Zannick: oh.. ok
2011-03-04T22:31:58  <antimatroid1> oh i see
2011-03-04T22:32:03  <antimatroid1> yeah that'd be messy
2011-03-04T22:32:03  <Zannick> i remember that from a topography class ^^,
2011-03-04T22:32:15  <antimatroid1> topography or topology?
2011-03-04T22:32:26  <Zannick> topology
2011-03-04T22:32:28  <Zannick> lol
2011-03-04T22:32:33  <antimatroid1> :p
2011-03-04T22:32:48  <Zannick> had trouble remembering the name in the first place
2011-03-04T22:32:53  <janzert> with that sort of topography, I think I'll stay away from wherever Zannick lives
2011-03-04T22:33:07  <jbroman> What, you don't have non-orientable mountains over there?
2011-03-04T22:34:23  * amstan 's mind is blown
2011-03-04T22:35:48  <amriedle> i have no idea what you guys are talking about all sounds like bs to me lol
2011-03-04T22:36:03  <amstan> amriedle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability
2011-03-04T22:36:45  <Zannick> hey, i live on a surface where if i keep going east far enough i end up west
2011-03-04T22:37:30  <jbroman> Zannick: Lies. You'll fall off the end of the earth!
2011-03-04T22:37:48  <Zannick> jbroman: well, yeah. but i'll land on the other end
2011-03-04T22:37:55  <Zannick> it's earth all the way down
2011-03-04T22:38:19  <amstan> they should make a cassete player with a mobius strip
2011-03-04T22:38:30  <amstan> that way you don't have to switch the sides
2011-03-04T22:38:36  <amstan> it just starts playing the other side automatically
2011-03-04T22:38:47  <jbroman> amstan: There is no other side to a moebius strip.
2011-03-04T22:38:58  <Zannick> some tape players just reverse

2011-03-04T23:17:12  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah.. no need for stashing, you can git checkout -b at any time
2011-03-04T23:17:23  <amstan> to switch to another branch
2011-03-04T23:17:38  <McLeopold> will it create the branch and keep my changes?
2011-03-04T23:17:44  <amstan> yes
2011-03-04T23:17:46  <amstan> i just tested it
2011-03-04T23:17:48  <McLeopold> ok
2011-03-04T23:17:51  <McLeopold> good to know
2011-03-04T23:17:59  <McLeopold> I'm learning so much today. :)

2011-03-04T23:27:46  <McLeopold> any mysql experts?
2011-03-04T23:28:06  <McLeopold> Why the hell can't I insert a 0 for a primary key on an auto_increment field!
2011-03-04T23:33:47  <amstan> McLeopold: because 0 is considered you don't want to fill that particular field, so it's automatic
2011-03-04T23:33:57  <amstan> McLeopold:  i think..
2011-03-04T23:34:28  <McLeopold> I'm doing an insert with id 1, then an update to move it to 0, then I full insert of the rest of my data
2011-03-04T23:35:14  <amstan> McLeopold: ask in #mysql
2011-03-04T23:35:20  <amstan> they're very helpful over there
2011-03-04T23:35:28  <amstan> just don't tell them that we're not hashing passwords
2011-03-04T23:35:35  <McLeopold> but we are?
2011-03-04T23:35:41  <Zannick> :<
2011-03-04T23:35:43  <amstan> nope
2011-03-04T23:35:45  <amstan> just md5
2011-03-04T23:36:00  <McLeopold> we could use password()
2011-03-04T23:36:03  <amstan> we should probably fix that
2011-03-04T23:36:26  <amstan> McLeopold: is that hashed? and does it have work to do? can you tweak it to be slower?
2011-03-04T23:37:36  *** chris__0076 <chris__0076!~Chris_007@adsl-176-15-110.asm.bellsouth.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-04T23:38:27  <McLeopold> slower?
2011-03-04T23:38:39  <amstan> yeah
2011-03-04T23:38:49  <McLeopold> so attackers can't try so many?
2011-03-04T23:38:50  <amstan> ideally you want your hashing function to take a lot to compute
2011-03-04T23:38:54  <amstan> like 100ms
2011-03-04T23:38:56  <amstan> exactly
2011-03-04T23:39:19  <janzert> bah, kids these days and there misunderstanding of even slightly older tech.
2011-03-04T23:39:19  <janzert> here's instructions for making your own cassette loop tape that shouldn't be too hard for you to modify
2011-03-04T23:39:19  <janzert> http://www.instructables.com/id/Audio-Cassette-Loop/
2011-03-04T23:39:22  <amstan> md5 is becoming easier and easier to break since it was designed to be fast to begin with, and now computers are faster than
2011-03-04T23:39:24  <amstan> so..
2011-03-04T23:39:31  <janzert> but I'll warn you it's not going to work like you expect :P
2011-03-04T23:39:47  <janzert> how it will actually work I'll leave as an exercise
2011-03-04T23:40:09  <amstan> janzert: i know how tapes work.. i didn't touch audio cds till like 2004
2011-03-04T23:40:10  <janzert> the problem isn't the hash (md5) the problem is we aren't salting them
2011-03-04T23:40:11  *** chris___0076 <chris___0076!~Chris_007@adsl-190-53-136.asm.bellsouth.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-03-04T23:40:35  <amstan> janzert: even if we're salting them, it's still rather easy, ideally we should get something designed for passwords
2011-03-04T23:40:38  <amstan> not for a ton of data
2011-03-04T23:41:01  <janzert> yes, you need to salt it correctly and we really shouldn't roll our own
2011-03-04T23:41:20  <janzert> but you can use md5 as your underlying hash and still be fine
2011-03-04T23:41:39  <amstan> janzert: yeah, there's ones that already do this
2011-03-04T23:42:35  <McLeopold> if we salt the hash, we should be fine
2011-03-04T23:42:36  <janzert> yeah, I wouldn't be surprised to find out that php even had a good built in method to do it
2011-03-04T23:43:32  <antimatroid1> i hate websites that spread something that should be on one page over many
2011-03-04T23:43:38  <antimatroid1> not as much as i hate nyt though
2011-03-04T23:44:18  <antimatroid1> i refuse to register to their site just to see a story, that sets a very horrible precedence for other websites
2011-03-04T23:44:40  <amstan> i saw an article once explaining what you can do to store passwords, comparing plaintext, encryption, md5, md5+salt, then something with a work load like bcrypt
2011-03-04T23:44:43  <McLeopold> amstan: for zeta, how about openid?
2011-03-04T23:45:12  <amstan> McLeopold: i tried openid, i didn't really get the concept, tried making my own with hypertriangle.com
2011-03-04T23:45:55  <jmcarthur> md5 is usually pretty quickly beaten with a rainbow table, even with salts
2011-03-04T23:46:00  <McLeopold> basically, if I logged in with google, ai-contest would trust when google says "it's mcleopold"
2011-03-04T23:46:29  <amstan> here's a good one: http://blankfield.net/proper-password-storage/
2011-03-04T23:46:43  <amstan> McLeopold: i got how it worked.. but... the setup is complicated, the system is too complex
2011-03-04T23:46:48  <jmcarthur> well, i should clarify
2011-03-04T23:47:11  <janzert> amstan: that is recommending an insecure method of salting
2011-03-04T23:47:13  <jmcarthur> i've *seen* rainbow tables beat md5 very quickly, even with salts, but the salts may have been kind of small
2011-03-04T23:47:30  <janzert> you shouldn't salt by doing hash(salt + password)
2011-03-04T23:47:32  <jmcarthur> good salts are different for each user
2011-03-04T23:47:54  <janzert> I've been trying to find an article that explains that but I'm not having a lot of luck at the moment
2011-03-04T23:48:26  <jmcarthur> basically, you want two fields in the db. one should be the salted and hashed password. the other should be a unique salt for that user.
2011-03-04T23:48:46  <amstan> jmcarthur: you can store it in the same field
2011-03-04T23:48:53  <jmcarthur> well yeah, but it's logically separate
2011-03-04T23:49:26  <amstan> jmcarthur: django does this: sha1$0b2e9$c14994cd6b1e82a2f6d04b9eb72d
2011-03-04T23:50:06  <jmcarthur> that's reasonable
2011-03-04T23:50:31  <amstan> i still don't like it, i was reading this article.. and it totally made me only use bcrypt or something with a workload
2011-03-04T23:51:26  <jmcarthur> huh, i just read about key stretching. that's an interesting one
2011-03-04T23:51:54  <McLeopold> I'm going to add salt, at least.  We can beef it up over time.
2011-03-04T23:51:59  <McLeopold> wait...
2011-03-04T23:52:03  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah.. that
2011-03-04T23:52:07  <McLeopold> We would need to have everyone reset
2011-03-04T23:52:16  <janzert> so long as you do salt per user it'll be fine
2011-03-04T23:52:27  <jmcarthur> use a randomly generated salt, but *don't* store it. then you must brute force it, even if legitimate.
2011-03-04T23:52:30  <amstan> McLeopold: we don't have anyone..
2011-03-04T23:52:33  <jmcarthur> ^^ key stretching
2011-03-04T23:52:34  <amstan> McLeopold: we're not keeping the users
2011-03-04T23:52:35  <McLeopold> yes, if it isn't per user, it's not salt
2011-03-04T23:52:47  <McLeopold> oh
2011-03-04T23:52:54  <McLeopold> What about zeta?
2011-03-04T23:53:09  <McLeopold> I thought we wanted leaderboard for contests themselves
2011-03-04T23:53:12  <amstan> McLeopold: zeta will use what django uses.. which i think is sha1+peruser salt
2011-03-04T23:53:23  <amstan> McLeopold: though, i'm sure that can be changed
2011-03-04T23:53:33  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: what do you mean by contest leaderboard?
2011-03-04T23:53:39  <McLeopold> okay, I'm just going to salt with the confirmation code
2011-03-04T23:53:40  <antimatroid1> as in pw > tron?
2011-03-04T23:54:18  <McLeopold> like, who's done the best across contests
2011-03-04T23:54:24  <antimatroid1> ah yeah
2011-03-04T23:54:39  <antimatroid1> i want to actually rank countries/organisations again too
2011-03-04T23:55:07  <amstan> just remember guys.. we have an issue tracker.. anything that you want to be done.. add it there
2011-03-04T23:55:28  <amstan> label it ants-epsilon, or launch if it must be done before launch
2011-03-04T23:55:47  <janzert> django can be sha, md5 or crypt
2011-03-04T23:57:55  <janzert> here's django's code for password hashing http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/auth/models.py
2011-03-04T23:57:57  <amstan> janzert: decent
2011-03-04T23:58:08  <janzert> the first two functions in that file
2011-03-04T23:58:26  <antimatroid1> there is this new art thing in tasmania, which is basically some rich guys own art, and he took a bunch of mould of peoples vaginas, titled it wall of cunts and people act as though it's something amazing, whenever I say cunt people look at me as though i killed a kitten
2011-03-04T23:58:41  <amstan> janzert: there doesn't seem to be a workload..
2011-03-04T23:58:41  <janzert> hmm, actually it just sha and md5
2011-03-04T23:58:54  <amstan> janzert: it has crypt.. just saw it
2011-03-04T23:58:59  <janzert> oh yeah it does
2011-03-04T23:59:05  <janzert> my eyes skipped over that
2011-03-04T23:59:14  <janzert> yeah, they're just using a salt + password
2011-03-04T23:59:32  <amstan> it's not strong enough, they crypt they're using
2011-03-04T23:59:48  <janzert> which from what I've read isn't the absolute best but apparently the feel is good enough
