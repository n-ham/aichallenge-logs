2011-05-25T11:52:41  <Frontier> Source code is not the problem, you can write that yourself any time.
2011-05-25T11:53:24  <Frontier> Functions like that should be part of the C standard as a cross platform language.
2011-05-25T11:55:37  <Frontier> Since I updated the D starter a few days ago I stumbled over this for timing: http://digitalmars.com/d/2.0/phobos/core_time.html#currSystemTick
2011-05-25T11:56:49  <Frontier> It shows that Windows, Linux and MacOS all use different functions for accurate timing, though gettimeofday is a good fallback for Linux/MacOS.
2011-05-25T11:58:44  <Frontier> "If [...] is unavailable, then Posix systems use gettimeofday(), which unfortunately, is not monotonic, [...]"
2011-05-25T12:03:54  <Frontier> antimatroid: anyway what about ctime.h -> clock_t clock(); ??

2011-05-25T18:36:58  <bhasker> earlier there were some games in which my bot was not behaving this way it would just follow the other bots the ones that move always upwards
2011-05-25T18:37:08  <amstan> the latest game was played with 26, which is most recent

2011-05-25T19:13:40  <bhasker> i guess its not a unique combination

2011-05-25T19:17:55  <McLeopold> and how php handles multiple results
2011-05-25T19:17:59  <bhasker> or maybe not

2011-05-25T19:18:41  <McLeopold> I've been avoiding it because we will ditch php someday
2011-05-25T19:18:56  <bhasker> the php we use is even more restricted

2011-05-25T19:21:41  <_flag> Don't worry, I've been working on a bot for awhile now so as soon as I make sure nobody's going to steal my code I'll battle you
2011-05-25T19:21:49  <amstan> bhasker: you trying to stay away from your own ants?
2011-05-25T19:21:57  <bhasker> no it just expands
2011-05-25T19:21:59  <bhasker> outwards
2011-05-25T19:22:07  <amstan> how?
2011-05-25T19:22:08  <bhasker> and the logic is rather simple
2011-05-25T19:22:43  <bhasker> findfood if not then find enemy ant else explore outwards
2011-05-25T19:22:56  <bhasker> by going to squares that have not been seen in most turns
2011-05-25T19:23:00  <amstan> yes, but how do you explore?
2011-05-25T19:23:09  <bhasker> i maintain a list of frontline squares
2011-05-25T19:23:13  <bhasker> and just route ants to frontlines
2011-05-25T19:23:27  <amstan> why do your middle ants keep moving then?
2011-05-25T19:23:28  <bhasker> where frontline is a) squares that have not been seen in some time
2011-05-25T19:23:46  <bhasker> since it has no memory
2011-05-25T19:23:49  <bhasker> sometimes ants oscillate
2011-05-25T19:23:53  <bhasker> between two points
2011-05-25T19:24:00  <bhasker> cause they keep getting rerouted
2011-05-25T19:24:19  <bhasker> i think i also make random moves
2011-05-25T19:24:23  <bhasker> if i can't figure anything to do

2011-05-25T19:24:34  <bhasker> go ahead:)
2011-05-25T19:24:40  <bhasker> i could submit it as an example
2011-05-25T19:24:58  <bhasker> though its rather complex and people would not want all that in a simple bot
2011-05-25T19:25:04  <bhasker> it does show how to do a bfs search
2011-05-25T19:25:09  <bhasker> and extract paths etc
2011-05-25T19:25:11  <amstan> bhasker: you could write a tutorial
2011-05-25T19:25:27  <amstan> bhasker: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/simple_strategy_guide.php
2011-05-25T19:25:51  <bhasker> my current bot is too complicated to be a simple tutorial
2011-05-25T19:25:56  <bhasker> maybe the greedybot that i wrote in python
2011-05-25T19:26:01  <bhasker> makes for a better tutorial
2011-05-25T19:26:02  <amstan> bhasker: sure
2011-05-25T19:26:44  <bhasker> who is solifugid though his bot is rather interesting
2011-05-25T19:26:53  <amstan> no idea
2011-05-25T19:26:54  <bhasker> though loses to mine due to inaction on his bots part
2011-05-25T19:27:04  <bhasker> it seems to expand and then just settle down
2011-05-25T19:27:08  <bhasker> and grabs only food nearby
2011-05-25T19:27:22  <bhasker> overtime it just loses due to lack of new territory where food will spawn
2011-05-25T19:28:03  <amstan> edward.h apparently
2011-05-25T19:28:22  <amstan> he must be from irc, i only think i posted the new test server in here

2011-05-25T19:43:40  <McLeopold> yes, are you doing sql injection attacks?
2011-05-25T19:44:09  <_flag> Trying, but I'll only be able to (potentially) affect the login_attempt table anyway
2011-05-25T19:44:36  <amstan> _flag: that's mostly useless
2011-05-25T19:44:49  <_flag> Yeah I know, but I feel like trying it anyway

2011-05-25T19:44:56  <_flag> yes
2011-05-25T19:45:00  <_flag> Wait, actually no
2011-05-25T19:45:07  <_flag> I might be able to add extra rows
2011-05-25T19:45:07  <amstan> so you could use it to lock other users out?
2011-05-25T19:45:21  <_flag> Possibly
2011-05-25T19:45:36  <amstan> ok, so it's more than an admin troll then
2011-05-25T19:45:50  <_flag> Is that how the server determines who to lock out?

2011-05-25T19:50:19  <amstan> McLeopold: does that really need to get escaped?
2011-05-25T19:50:42  <_flag> I can fake an X-Forwarded-For header amstan
2011-05-25T19:50:54  <_flag> The other IP doesn't need to be escaped though
2011-05-25T19:50:59  <McLeopold> I looked at the code and then decided you were a genius to try to attack it that way.
2011-05-25T19:51:24  <amstan> yes.. but.. ip address, shouldn't it be composed of dots and digits?
2011-05-25T19:52:22  <_flag> X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1'), (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Someone Else', '1.1.1.1', '1.1.1.1

2011-05-25T20:41:13  <amstan> why doesn't it do that on register?

2011-05-25T21:00:07  <amstan> mysql_real_escape is the one you should be using

2011-05-25T21:00:35  <_flag> It just needed to be escaped in the javascript

2011-05-25T21:29:55  <_flag> What does the output of git branch -vv look like?
2011-05-25T21:30:11  <amstan> i'm going to use echo exec("git branch -vv|grep -e ^\\*");
2011-05-25T21:30:51  <amstan> it outputs the current branch name, checks against remote(it'll say if remote is more up to date), outputs commit hash and commit message
2011-05-25T21:31:18  <amstan> perhaps this is not for contestants, maybe i should use git describe --tags

2011-05-25T22:35:27  <smiley1983> I just discovered an issue on the aichallengebeta site: I tried to edit the profile info to answer a question in there, and when I try to save I get: "Invalid country id: 25"
2011-05-25T22:36:19  <smiley1983> It was originally id: 0 or something (it had lost the country field) - when I change it to Australia it changes the number but not the error.
2011-05-25T22:36:43  <smiley1983> and to answer the question here, I made the solifugid profile.
2011-05-25T22:36:58  <amstan> bhasker: now we know ^
2011-05-25T22:37:26  <amstan> smiley1983: yes, _flag was playing with sql injections, blame him for any damages to your profile(except the bio(that was me))
2011-05-25T22:37:44  <smiley1983> Noticed other people were having trouble when they uploaded things more complex than the starter packs, so thought I should test an ocaml bot there - seems to work.
