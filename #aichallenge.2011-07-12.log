2011-07-12T09:00:06  <bhasker> i think the new version should be able to break into the 70's

2011-07-12T09:34:39  <Eruquen> how are the ranks/skill calculated? if I beat people with a higher rank, should I not get a higher rank or higher skill?
2011-07-12T09:35:01  <mcstar> my friend just finished his math masters thesis, and he didnt know about matroids :)
2011-07-12T09:36:08  <smiley1983> Eruquen: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill
2011-07-12T09:37:02  <smiley1983> because both mu and sigma change, sometimes you will get a non-intuitive change in estimated skill
2011-07-12T09:37:48  <Eruquen> mine doesnt change at all
2011-07-12T09:38:02  <Eruquen> hasn't changed for two days
2011-07-12T09:38:16  <smiley1983> that sounds like a bug

2011-07-12T09:38:41  <Eruquen> I keep beating players with much higher skill and better rank
2011-07-12T09:38:47  <mcstar> smiley1983: ask him how many games the bot played since

2011-07-12T09:39:38  <Eruquen> Eruquen is my account name
2011-07-12T09:39:47  <Eruquen> 169 games played with this version of the bot
2011-07-12T09:40:18  <Eruquen> oh wait, I just spotted that my bot has a skill value of 59.21 but my account is listed as 1.13
2011-07-12T09:40:53  <Eruquen> what exactly is the account's skill value if not the skill of my bot?
2011-07-12T09:42:04  <mcstar> its the trueskill
2011-07-12T09:42:33  <mcstar> its a statistical method do determine better-ness
2011-07-12T09:42:41  <mcstar> read it on wiki
2011-07-12T09:42:48  <mcstar> yep smiley1983 gave the link already
2011-07-12T09:43:03  <smiley1983> Okay, it looks like your actual rank is 61
2011-07-12T09:43:13  <mcstar> i see no problem there
2011-07-12T09:43:33  <smiley1983> The info at the top of the page isn't being updated for some reason
2011-07-12T09:43:53  <Eruquen> oh, okay
2011-07-12T09:44:03  <Eruquen> well, 61 sounds about right

2011-07-12T09:44:39  <smiley1983> the "current rankings" page is the place to go to find your actual rank

2011-07-12T10:16:38  <antimatroid> some stuff from complex analysis is surprisingly simple, but i don't know very much and i'd hardly say it's overall easier (especially intuitively) than real analysis :P

2011-07-12T10:23:14  <mcstar> bookmarked
2011-07-12T10:23:20  <mcstar> but you know theres a problem
2011-07-12T10:23:28  <antimatroid> ?
2011-07-12T10:23:40  <mcstar>  i relized that downloading them anbd actually reding them, is well, land and sky
2011-07-12T10:23:43  <mcstar> if you know what i mean
2011-07-12T10:23:45  <sigh> :)
2011-07-12T10:23:57  <antimatroid> i just grab something if i need something in particular
2011-07-12T10:24:25  <antimatroid> rapid library is the second best thing i've found for texts, but this russian site is amazing
2011-07-12T10:24:28  <mcstar> soon society will collapse under the weight of its knowledge
2011-07-12T10:24:38  <antimatroid> information overload?
2011-07-12T10:24:47  <mcstar> in every possible way
2011-07-12T10:24:57  <mcstar> professional/intertainment/news
2011-07-12T10:24:59  <mcstar> anything
2011-07-12T10:25:03  <mcstar> i->e
2011-07-12T10:25:15  <sigh> it's already the case everything is too specialised
2011-07-12T10:25:21  <mcstar> yeah
2011-07-12T10:25:44  <mcstar> you have a hard time understanding another dicipline's close-to-state-of-the-art results
2011-07-12T10:25:55  <antimatroid> yeah, i have a gripe with that and specialisation with production of stuf
2011-07-12T10:26:10  <sigh> I don't understand state-of-the-art much of anything :P
2011-07-12T10:26:17  <mcstar> but we can all pray, that singularity will happen soon, so lets donate Ray Kurzweil some money
2011-07-12T10:26:22  <antimatroid> everybody is trying to squeeze the last bit of profit out of everything from every last little component of something, i don't think it's anywhere near socially optimal
2011-07-12T10:26:25  <mcstar> maybe he can buy another car
2011-07-12T10:27:05  <mcstar> well, economy was stable becasue of its fast growth
2011-07-12T10:27:16  <mcstar> this is the single most important fact today
2011-07-12T10:27:20  <antimatroid> sigh: happy with the carbon tax?
2011-07-12T10:27:34  <mcstar> (we have hamburger tax since yesterday)
2011-07-12T10:27:40  <antimatroid> haha nice
2011-07-12T10:27:41  <sigh> haven't been paying attention to politics lately
2011-07-12T10:28:12  <antimatroid> i have taken to reading a bit about that, seems like they've done a reasonable job of it to me
2011-07-12T10:28:16  <antimatroid> at least for starters
2011-07-12T10:28:38  <mcstar> who cares about varbon emission? china will produce co2 multiple times that is produced now
2011-07-12T10:28:56  <antimatroid> apparently china is also looking at ways to reduce carbon emissions
2011-07-12T10:29:00  <mcstar> hehe
2011-07-12T10:29:01  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-12T10:29:17  <rabidus> mcstar: where do you live?
2011-07-12T10:29:23  <mcstar> right here
2011-07-12T10:29:26  <mcstar> where elseM
2011-07-12T10:29:27  <rabidus> where
2011-07-12T10:29:28  <mcstar> ?
2011-07-12T10:29:30  <rabidus> :<
2011-07-12T10:29:34  <mcstar> hungary
2011-07-12T10:29:37  <rabidus> ah, ok
2011-07-12T10:29:51  <rabidus> for real, hamburger tax?
2011-07-12T10:29:52  <mcstar> you finland right?
2011-07-12T10:29:54  <rabidus> right
2011-07-12T10:30:09  <mcstar> yes, they tax fast food, chips, candies, sodas
2011-07-12T10:30:19  <antimatroid> but yeah, australia doing something wont change anything significantly globally with respect to carbon emmissions, but we do now get the right to put pressure on other countries without looking like some countries stance of "do as we say, not what we do" and we get an advantage with our industries being forced into "getting ahead of the foreign competition" for more environmentally friendly production
2011-07-12T10:30:40  <mcstar> but the gov' said it all goes into healt-problems prevention
2011-07-12T10:31:17  <mcstar> antimatroid: ok, its a good initiative, i dont doubt it
2011-07-12T10:31:36  <mcstar> but china and those other countries need to take this even more seriously
2011-07-12T10:32:11  <mcstar> i wonder what will happen when our ancestors stop being constantly hungry, and want money houses, living standards and such
2011-07-12T10:32:13  <antimatroid> yes, one problem with that though is a lot of other countries elevated themselves to the level they are today with such environmentally unfriendly practices
2011-07-12T10:32:26  <sigh> ancestors?
2011-07-12T10:32:30  <antimatroid> it's not enitrely fair to say developing or not as well of nations should take as much action as us
2011-07-12T10:32:33  <mcstar> (africans)
2011-07-12T10:32:38  <mcstar> black people
2011-07-12T10:32:43  <mcstar> in africa
2011-07-12T10:32:47  <mcstar> the new china
2011-07-12T10:33:33  <mcstar> africa is HUGE
2011-07-12T10:33:40  <antimatroid> imo we need to work globally on the issue, and developing nations need to be cut more slack than somewhat developed nations, but developing nations should also somewhat be able to learn from our past mistakes and use our technological advancements to speed their progress
2011-07-12T10:33:41  <mcstar> we discussed this a couple of months ago
2011-07-12T10:34:08  <mcstar> antimatroid: but they need to give jobs and food to their people
2011-07-12T10:34:32  <mcstar> when in femine, environmental pollution is never an issue
2011-07-12T10:34:44  <sigh> often war, too
2011-07-12T10:34:52  <antimatroid> yes, like being a vegan/vegetarian
2011-07-12T10:34:52  <mcstar> yeah that too
2011-07-12T10:35:03  <mcstar> huh?
2011-07-12T10:35:10  <mcstar> i lost you
2011-07-12T10:35:14  <mcstar> i know you love lost
2011-07-12T10:35:16  <mcstar> i dont
2011-07-12T10:35:17  <sigh> he means that being vegan is a first world luxury
2011-07-12T10:35:19  <antimatroid> that's not always a valid option in developing nations
2011-07-12T10:35:23  <mcstar> ah
2011-07-12T10:35:30  <mcstar> really?
2011-07-12T10:35:32  <mcstar> why?
2011-07-12T10:35:44  <antimatroid> not if you want to have a healthy diet (as in able to sustain you long term)
2011-07-12T10:36:04  <antimatroid> food can be scarce and they don't have the kind of "supplements" available in first world nations
2011-07-12T10:36:39  <mcstar> i think you only need the will to cultivate vegetables
2011-07-12T10:36:50  <mcstar> its easier thant grow cows
2011-07-12T10:36:54  <mcstar> than to
2011-07-12T10:36:57  <mcstar> sorry
2011-07-12T10:37:04  <mcstar> row is not the right word
2011-07-12T10:37:16  <antimatroid> one of the big things people are complaining about here is the fact that consumers are going to be compensated for their increase in costs from the carbon tax
2011-07-12T10:37:17  <mcstar> what do you do with cows?
2011-07-12T10:37:22  <sigh> raise/breed
2011-07-12T10:37:28  <mcstar> thanks
2011-07-12T10:37:33  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-12T10:37:58  <antimatroid> but the size of the "rebates" is independent of each persons carbon consumption, so people still have the incentive to move away from goods with an increased cost from the tax
2011-07-12T10:38:45  <mcstar> as per person, what does produce much carbon?
2011-07-12T10:38:53  <mcstar> a car obviusly
2011-07-12T10:38:56  <mcstar> but other than that?
2011-07-12T10:39:04  <mcstar> some food processing?
2011-07-12T10:39:08  <antimatroid> their consumption of goods with carbon produced during production counts as carbon consumption
2011-07-12T10:39:17  <mcstar> yeah, but what exactly
2011-07-12T10:39:25  <antimatroid> i have no idea about the science :P
2011-07-12T10:39:36  <mcstar> or making plastic?
2011-07-12T10:39:52  <antimatroid> i ride my bike as often as possible these days
2011-07-12T10:40:05  <mcstar> but that is for your OWN health
2011-07-12T10:40:09  <mcstar> not for the planet
2011-07-12T10:40:32  <antimatroid> more to save money and it's more fun, but yeah health reasons and not supporting oil is a big plus to me
2011-07-12T10:40:50  <antimatroid> i can't do exercise just for health reasons, i'm not that motivated
2011-07-12T10:40:53  <mcstar> how far are you from uni?
2011-07-12T10:41:02  <antimatroid> ~30m ride, just over 9km
2011-07-12T10:41:25  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-12T10:41:33  <mcstar> just enough to make you sweat
2011-07-12T10:41:41  <antimatroid> depends how hard you ride
2011-07-12T10:41:50  <mcstar> i cant ride easy
2011-07-12T10:42:02  <mcstar> im forced to pedal hard
2011-07-12T10:42:14  <antimatroid> i don't usually push myself very hard
2011-07-12T10:42:20  <antimatroid> depending on the day
2011-07-12T10:42:30  <mcstar> but i need to, cause otherwise i were slipping down the seat
2011-07-12T10:42:31  <antimatroid> it's been windy and cold this week so i have
2011-07-12T10:42:39  <antimatroid> it was even raining on the way home today
2011-07-12T10:42:56  <mcstar> oh, thats an inconvenience
2011-07-12T10:43:06  <mcstar> i mean, i wouldnt ride in wind/rain
2011-07-12T10:43:14  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-12T10:43:19  <antimatroid> i used to avoid it, but i've decided to man up about it :)
2011-07-12T10:43:49  <antimatroid> i'd probably still drive if it was raining when i was leaving
2011-07-12T10:43:58  <mcstar> now i have a role model
2011-07-12T10:45:06  <antimatroid> :P

2011-07-12T10:52:48  <rabidus> shared for everyone
2011-07-12T10:52:56  <rabidus> and you could just move around in that 'world'

2011-07-12T11:17:02  <bhasker> doh
2011-07-12T11:17:05  <bhasker> last upload flunked lol
2011-07-12T11:17:14  <bhasker> had another .cpp with a main() function
2011-07-12T11:17:15  <bhasker> bah
2011-07-12T11:17:19  <bhasker> in the folder
2011-07-12T11:17:58  <mcstar> you think that messed up G+?
2011-07-12T11:18:26  <mcstar> (ah, sorry its the heat, i find anything amusing)
2011-07-12T11:18:43  <bhasker> its just the way the c++ code built on the server
2011-07-12T11:18:49  <bhasker> it just compiles and links all .cpp files
2011-07-12T11:19:01  <bhasker> so if there are two main() functions the link will fail
2011-07-12T11:19:08  <bhasker> in this case though it flunked because of this
2011-07-12T11:19:25  <bhasker> testmod.h included <iostream.h> which is deprecated !
2011-07-12T11:19:34  <bhasker> i am too used to working with gcc-2.95.3

2011-07-12T14:50:22  <zygon4> so.. i attempted to sign up for the challenge. I'm listed as a participant. but I either did not receive an email (I checked my spam box) or somehow I missed it..
2011-07-12T14:50:57  <zygon4> Is there someone I can poke to either get a new email for account activation or should I just sign up again?
2011-07-12T14:51:14  <zygon4> Anyone have an idea?
2011-07-12T14:53:16  <gobang> zygon4, there's no email yet, go back or signup again, this time click the 'activate me' link at the bottom instead

2011-07-12T14:59:55  <MikeTheAnt> I have the same problem. should I then have to sign up with a new user name?
2011-07-12T15:00:43  <gobang> haha, another nickname2 candidate ;)
2011-07-12T15:01:29  <MikeTheAnt> But I cannot see any activation button, only the Create button

2011-07-12T15:03:18  <mcstar> i dont recommend that you pollute the BETA server with registrations, but theres no problem with doing it again i guess
2011-07-12T15:03:38  <mcstar> you cant log in?
2011-07-12T15:03:57  <mcstar> cause as far as i can remember, i just tpyed in my given password, and it worked
2011-07-12T15:04:37  <MikeTheAnt> I cannot log in. not looking to pollute.. just want to try my ant farm.. :)
2011-07-12T15:04:48  <mcstar> sure
2011-07-12T15:04:49  <mcstar> try again then
2011-07-12T15:05:24  <MikeTheAnt> Login failed
2011-07-12T15:05:38  <gobang> it's the 'Click Here' link  after the Login form
2011-07-12T15:06:34  <MikeTheAnt> ahh.. so the button appears after I have created the account?
2011-07-12T15:07:26  <MikeTheAnt> found it. thanks
2011-07-12T15:09:03  <mcstar> its working
2011-07-12T15:09:08  <mcstar> just click activate

2011-07-12T15:52:21  <mcstar> i signed up again, there was an empty game line
2011-07-12T15:52:25  <mcstar> i was surprised
2011-07-12T15:54:23  <gobang> at least, they've won their first game : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=386

2011-07-12T15:55:33  <mcstar> i think this is the problem of the engine that queries the database and makes the html page

2011-07-12T16:23:59  <mleise> I just realized that files extracted from zip files keep executable bits on Linux. Should I keep the two separate packages for Windows and Linux/MacOS, or merge them as before. The only benefit is that there are no scripts for the other operating system included.
2011-07-12T16:25:22  <mcstar> yes
