2011-11-14T00:01:02  <NightExcessive> Any advice on programmatically finding a choke point (to make a wall of ants)?
2011-11-14T00:01:08  <janzert> yeah, it might be a little better if we reproduce that tar file ourselves from source
2011-11-14T00:02:12  <amstan> NightExcessive: increase the thickness of all the walls, until your path gets blocked
2011-11-14T00:02:13  <bmh> NightExcessive: min-cut
2011-11-14T00:04:27  <amstan> janzert: also, this: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1872
2011-11-14T00:04:42  <janzert> only slightly related but I think we're well past the point of diminishing returns on adding
2011-11-14T00:04:58  <bmh> adding languages?
2011-11-14T00:05:05  <amstan> janzert: hmm?
2011-11-14T00:05:18  <janzert> oops, yes adding languages
2011-11-14T00:09:14  <janzert> of the 28 supported languages 26 are being used http://pastebin.com/ZDVsE1gB
2011-11-14T00:10:07  <amstan> woot! python
2011-11-14T00:10:18  <amstan> ugh.. VB is more than haskell
2011-11-14T00:10:34  <bmh> ha.
2011-11-14T00:10:45  <bmh> amstan: with 70 haskell bots, I'm hoping for the best!
2011-11-14T00:11:00  <amstan> so.. C++11... i don't like that name
2011-11-14T00:11:09  <NightExcessive> How is OpenJDK 6 with speed in comparison to C++? (I know the JRE 7 is closing on C)
2011-11-14T00:11:18  <janzert> Groovy and Scheme are the two not being used by anyone
2011-11-14T00:11:19  <amstan> when i first heard about C++0x i really liked it, because i tought 0x was meant to represent the hex
2011-11-14T00:11:29  <amstan> janzert: scheme starter package is barely there
2011-11-14T00:11:39  <amstan> i think
2011-11-14T00:11:49  <janzert> and groovy not at all of course
2011-11-14T00:11:56  <amstan> yeah
2011-11-14T00:12:22  <janzert> Groovy is supported because someone kept wanting it in planetwars but then never used it there either :/
2011-11-14T00:12:34  <amstan> oh well
2011-11-14T00:12:49  <bmh> Groovy is a terrible language
2011-11-14T00:12:53  * bmh has opinions
2011-11-14T00:13:32  <amstan> janzert: is it really a problem to support them? like it's just a few lines in the compiler and setup script
2011-11-14T00:13:50  <a1k0n> is rexx still supported?!
2011-11-14T00:13:52  <amstan> unless it's not in ubuntu
2011-11-14T00:13:53  <amstan> a1k0n: lol!
2011-11-14T00:13:55  <janzert> if no one uses it at least :)
2011-11-14T00:14:15  <janzert> a1k0n: not by us
2011-11-14T00:14:16  <amstan> oh man.. i forgot about the rexx guy
2011-11-14T00:14:39  <amstan> he really wanted to use rexx, but didn't know how to make a starter package
2011-11-14T00:14:50  <amstan> and this was in tron, where I/O was really easy
2011-11-14T00:14:58  <janzert> the problem with supporting multiple languages is each language advocate always wants a new version or different options :/
2011-11-14T00:15:08  <janzert> ahh, I remember that
2011-11-14T00:15:20  <NightExcessive> If C# got the optimizer flag I'd definitely use it :)
2011-11-14T00:15:38  <janzert> the latter problem should go away once we put the build process in the user's hands
2011-11-14T00:16:11  <a1k0n> man, i don't wanna wait 547 minutes for a game
2011-11-14T00:16:42  <a1k0n> whatever happened to the <(''<) anyway
2011-11-14T00:17:10  <janzert> got removed since it didn't work quite right and mostly confused people
2011-11-14T00:17:23  <janzert> I think McLeopold still had plans to fix it up and put it back in though
2011-11-14T00:17:40  <amstan> it also confused a bunch of indexing engines and made them break the memcached stuff
2011-11-14T00:17:52  <amstan> that was hilarious
2011-11-14T00:18:02  <janzert> heh, that was the cause?
2011-11-14T00:18:30  <amstan> janzert: the kirbys had to be htmlentitied
2011-11-14T00:18:32  <a1k0n> hahah
2011-11-14T00:18:55  <janzert> yeah, I remember fixing that at one point
2011-11-14T00:18:57  <amstan> the indexing engines were parsing the links wrong, so /rankings.php/forums?page=1 appeared
2011-11-14T00:19:13  <amstan> but then fixing the kirbys didn't fix it in their cache
2011-11-14T00:19:18  <a1k0n> nice
2011-11-14T00:19:19  <amstan> so they kept requesting that page
2011-11-14T00:19:49  <amstan> the pagination script outputs a relative url, so forums?page=2 came into existence
2011-11-14T00:19:53  <amstan> then the memcached remembered that
2011-11-14T00:19:53  <janzert> yeah, I didn't realize that's how they got the bad link though
2011-11-14T00:19:57  <amstan> and it showed it to the users
2011-11-14T00:20:24  <amstan> while fixing that, i restarted memcached, which temporarly broke the frontpage game display
2011-11-14T00:20:41  <amstan> while looking for a manual update on that i crashed the mysql server, and then the workers crashed
2011-11-14T00:20:53  <amstan> all from the one kirby presented to the wrong bing bot!
2011-11-14T00:20:58  <janzert> error cascade :)
2011-11-14T00:22:52  <amstan> janzert: we should probably write something about the wall tile vs cpu time
2011-11-14T00:22:53  <NightExcessive> Are there debugger commands in the main tools package? (from git)
2011-11-14T00:22:54  <amstan> and why
2011-11-14T00:23:05  <amstan> NightExcessive: what?

2011-11-14T00:30:39  <amstan> woah! 4 workers up now
2011-11-14T00:31:38  <amstan> well.. i should really go to bed
2011-11-14T00:31:56  <amstan> this contest got to the point where just reading forum posts and doing small changes is addictive
2011-11-14T00:34:20  <amstan> janzert: using csc for myisampacking the pw stuff is a go
2011-11-14T00:34:49  <BenJackson> bmh: I'm not sure it's even in NP
2011-11-14T00:35:08  <BenJackson> remember NP means if someone dropped a solution out of the sky you could verify it was correct in polynomial time
2011-11-14T00:35:20  <bmh> point
2011-11-14T00:35:21  <BenJackson> so if I gave you a bunch of ant moves, could you even tell me if they wre correct?
2011-11-14T00:36:07  <bmh> How about this formulation: Assign a score to each point on the board. Find the arrangement of ants that maximizes the total score.
2011-11-14T00:36:26  <janzert> amstan: great
2011-11-14T00:36:26  <amstan> isn't figuring out where to move the whole game?
2011-11-14T00:36:32  <amstan> there's not much else you can do
2011-11-14T00:36:35  <amstan> besides timing out
2011-11-14T00:36:51  <bmh> amstan: I'm thinking of the case where you have several ants jostling for a square
2011-11-14T00:36:58  <BenJackson> bmh: if you can make that score assignment cheap enough there are loads of ways to use that to write a bot
2011-11-14T00:37:11  <Antimony> that's actually what my current bot does
2011-11-14T00:37:21  <bmh> mine too
2011-11-14T00:37:21  <Antimony> it's basically a giant cosntratin optimizatin solver
2011-11-14T00:37:44  <BenJackson> Antimony: where's your profile?  I like guessing how the bots work from watching the replays

2011-11-14T00:38:02  <Antimony> tell me what you think
2011-11-14T00:39:30  <BenJackson> your feeding and exploration looks solid but you have no combat
2011-11-14T00:39:57  <Antimony> yep
2011-11-14T00:39:59  <BenJackson> hm, mazes a weakness
2011-11-14T00:40:17  <Antimony> well exploration isn't too great either
2011-11-14T00:40:58  <BenJackson> you don't clump up or waste many moves in open spaces that I saw
2011-11-14T00:43:03  <Antimony> yeah, I have anticlumping. Scores are decreased for being near other ants, and distances increase faster when propogating thorugh space near an ant

2011-11-14T00:44:55  <Antimony> one other thing I still need to do is keep track of stored food so I can tell ants to move off the mound
2011-11-14T00:45:00  <Antimony> but combat is a higher priority
2011-11-14T00:45:36  <analyst74> why don't you always keep the mound open?

2011-11-14T00:46:00  <BenJackson> curious how both bots have very similar issues escaping spawn
2011-11-14T00:47:27  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@man-208-94.pks.muni.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-14T00:48:00  <BenJackson> so this weekend I had hoped to come up with the idea to take my bot to the next level
2011-11-14T00:48:15  <BenJackson> buut despite thinking interesting thoughts I didn't really do that
2011-11-14T00:48:30  <bmh> BenJackson: symmetry detector? :)
2011-11-14T00:48:32  <analyst74> I had same plan. lol
2011-11-14T00:48:44  <BenJackson> I did figure out a lot about symmetry and write some interesting code
2011-11-14T00:49:19  <BenJackson> I can find hills without seeing them
2011-11-14T00:49:42  <analyst74> how do you find it useful? I always suspect raiding far-away hill is a risky strategy
2011-11-14T00:49:44  <BenJackson> however in my tests that wasn't necessarily a good thing:  the rest of my bot tuning then tended to attack hills it couldn't really reach
2011-11-14T00:49:48  <bmh> what's the magic? Translational symmetry seems easy
2011-11-14T00:50:16  <BenJackson> bmh: seemed easier until I looked into it :)
2011-11-14T00:50:48  <BenJackson> analyst74: the replay that got me interested in it was the same map as linked above
2011-11-14T00:51:12  <Antimony> The reason I don't always keep the mound clear is that it's sometimes beneficial to not have it clear
2011-11-14T00:51:16  <BenJackson> it's so far (topologically) between the two enemy hills that there's often a big lull while both bots eke out that last bit of exploration
2011-11-14T00:51:17  <Antimony> like in a defence situation
2011-11-14T00:51:37  <BenJackson> so it could be a big advantage on that map to know your enemy's location sooner
2011-11-14T00:51:50  <BenJackson> or possibly in any 1-v-1
2011-11-14T00:52:27  <analyst74> that's most effective against people with no hill-defending logic
2011-11-14T00:53:00  <Antimony> I think the reason my ants got stuck in that maze game
2011-11-14T00:53:03  <bmh> if you can determine symmetry, you can race to the bottlenecks
2011-11-14T00:53:15  <Antimony> is because I attempted goal occlusion by increasing distancse when propgated past an ant
2011-11-14T00:53:24  <BenJackson> I haven't really done anything about bottlenecks
2011-11-14T00:53:30  <Antimony> so the distances seen near the mound are essentially noise
2011-11-14T00:53:48  <Antimony> because you have to go past so many ants to get to the nearest food
2011-11-14T00:56:57  <analyst74> after that long march, if you don't win, you'd lose soon after
2011-11-14T00:57:02  <Antimony> I wonder if I should try geting rid of the goal occlusion thing
2011-11-14T00:57:30  <BenJackson> you'd probably end up with something like my first bot
2011-11-14T00:57:36  <BenJackson> which has very snake-like behavior
2011-11-14T00:57:41  <BenJackson> sending too many ants after each food
2011-11-14T00:58:02  <cyphase> i haven't had much time to work on my bot :(
2011-11-14T00:58:18  <cyphase> i'm still halfway through my pathfinding code
2011-11-14T00:58:49  <BenJackson> even if I don't do any better than I am now I still learned some interesting things
2011-11-14T00:59:47  <cyphase> when does the winter competition start?
2011-11-14T00:59:50  <analyst74> very true, and if you can think of other non-obvious ways to use that knowledge, you'd be sitting on gold. :)
2011-11-14T01:00:07  <analyst74> isn't it winter already??
2011-11-14T01:00:08  <BenJackson> cyphase: someone was suggesting there'd probably be a 3-6 month gap
2011-11-14T01:00:25  <analyst74> yearly would be best...
2011-11-14T01:00:43  <BenJackson> I'm sorry I missed tron
2011-11-14T01:00:46  <BenJackson> I didn't hear about it
2011-11-14T01:01:00  <BenJackson> I heard about planetwars and my immediate reaction was that I had no idea how I'd play that as a human
2011-11-14T01:01:13  <cyphase> i miight have heard about this before, but i didnt look into it enough to remember it
2011-11-14T01:01:29  <BenJackson> there's still over a month left
2011-11-14T01:01:31  <Antimony> ug
2011-11-14T01:01:34  <cyphase> yea
2011-11-14T01:01:44  <Antimony> I hate how calling erase on an invalid iterator causes an infinite loop
2011-11-14T01:01:51  <Antimony> I've had that hpapen to me twice now
2011-11-14T01:02:02  <BenJackson> there's an idiom for that
2011-11-14T01:02:13  <BenJackson> eg myset.erase(it++)
2011-11-14T01:02:18  <bmh> I think I'm just going to try to solve every possible position on a cluster and then have my bot look up the optimal behavior ;)
2011-11-14T01:02:31  <BenJackson> it's somewhat awkward because you have to structure the loop so it's if X erase+increment else increment
2011-11-14T01:02:43  <cyphase> bmh, good luck with that
2011-11-14T01:02:57  <BenJackson> yeah, lots of people want to do reinforcement learning or similar here
2011-11-14T01:03:00  <bmh> cyphase: the universe will live long enough for that to work, right?
2011-11-14T01:03:02  <BenJackson> the state space is enormous
2011-11-14T01:03:25  <BenJackson> I thought at first i could do combat based on pattern matching some local area
2011-11-14T01:03:31  <Antimony> I was makign a copy of the iteraotr and then incrementing
2011-11-14T01:03:33  <cyphase> bmh, let's ask Deep Thought
2011-11-14T01:03:41  <Antimony> but I accidently called erase on the wrong iterator
2011-11-14T01:03:51  <bmh> cyphase: how do you reverse entropy?
2011-11-14T01:03:53  <BenJackson> even with rotational symmetry I wound up with something like 2^80 map/bot configurations inside active combat radius
2011-11-14T01:04:45  <bmh> ouch!
2011-11-14T01:05:31  <cyphase> bmh, cat /dev/zero > /dev/universe/entropy
2011-11-14T01:05:40  <Antimony> so how do you detect symmetries? The best I could think of is to hash each visible NxN block, but I haven't tried yet
2011-11-14T01:05:51  <Antimony> and look for duplicate hash values
2011-11-14T01:05:54  <bmh> BenJackson: are you ben.com?
2011-11-14T01:05:58  <BenJackson> yes
2011-11-14T01:06:11  <cyphase> awesome, 3-letter domain
2011-11-14T01:06:15  <bmh> (your cats are cute)
2011-11-14T01:06:20  <BenJackson> Antimony: the actual game engine does it brute force

2011-11-14T01:12:42  <BenJackson> the one with the easy opponent gets a head start
2011-11-14T01:13:06  <Antimony> what I don't get is why the bot I put as the first player always loses
2011-11-14T01:13:12  <BenJackson> hm, gvies me an idea, I should add an option to delay starting or run at half speed or something so I can artificially increase the difficulty
2011-11-14T01:13:47  <BenJackson> the pattern I see on that map is that one of each pair of neighbors wins and the winners of those fight each other
2011-11-14T01:13:54  <BenJackson> if everyone is closely balanced

2011-11-14T01:14:15  <Antimony> maybe it has to do with teh order you consider moves in

2011-11-14T01:18:09  <Antimony> one of the methods I tried leads to oscilating ants
2011-11-14T01:18:24  <Antimony> that was in the previous version of my bot, the one that made squares all the tiem
2011-11-14T01:18:50  <BenJackson> I haven't seen any bots travelling in 2x2 blocks lately

2011-11-14T06:09:07  <rexou> hi guys
2011-11-14T06:09:33  <rexou> i'm having an issue while compiling my code
2011-11-14T06:09:58  <rexou> it contains c++ox features using but it's not detected as c++11
2011-11-14T06:10:07  <jix> is anyone else getting random spikes of a few 100ms for some turns using java or scala?
2011-11-14T06:10:19  <jix> (that is locally though)

2011-11-14T06:13:53  <rexou> Can someone using c++ox features in his code tell me if there's something special to do, brb
2011-11-14T06:16:13  <jix> rexou: use MyBot.cc for c++ and MyBot.cpp for c++11
2011-11-14T06:16:32  <jix> at least worker/compiler.py looks like that
2011-11-14T06:16:36  <rexou> oh :)
2011-11-14T06:16:42  <jix> you can use whatever extension you want for the other files
2011-11-14T06:16:45  <rexou> thank you
2011-11-14T06:17:01  <jix> (from the set .{c,cpp,cc} that is)
2011-11-14T06:17:09  <rexou> yeah i got used to put .cpp for both but i saw .cc on the website
2011-11-14T06:17:20  <rexou> just a convention related story :p
2011-11-14T06:17:34  <rexou> anyway, thanks, will be helpful
2011-11-14T06:20:35  <liberforce> hum... bots should get an "end" message when they timeout
2011-11-14T06:20:54  <liberforce> currently the game engine just kills the timed out bots

2011-11-14T06:32:21  <jix> heh... the big 200ms spikes only happen when my visualizer app is running in parallel
2011-11-14T06:32:48  <jix> nevertheless I now have code that runs a GC if there is spare time at the end of the turn just in case
2011-11-14T06:33:40  <Varan> running GC is a very had idea in general
2011-11-14T06:34:10  <Varan> it stops the entire VM
2011-11-14T06:34:48  <p_l> Varan: depends on VM, and sometimes on its settings
2011-11-14T06:34:56  <Varan> yes
2011-11-14T06:35:04  <Zao> (and language)
2011-11-14T06:35:04  <jix> Varan: I only do it when I have spare time... the VM will decide to do a GC at some point anyway
2011-11-14T06:35:25  <Zao> jix: Or you could write code that never allocates.
2011-11-14T06:35:33  <Varan> or allocates less
2011-11-14T06:35:39  <jix> Zao: that must be fun in scala

2011-11-14T06:35:50  <Zao> It's pretty much what one has to do if you ever target the .NET Compact Framework on the 360.
2011-11-14T06:35:58  <Zao> (not that it's overly related to ants, but still)
2011-11-14T06:36:23  <p_l> Zao: and it's frankly ages old thing Lisp programmers learnt before Java was called Oak ;-)
2011-11-14T06:37:51  <jix> well I'm not going to change code to allocate less unless I identified it as a bottleneck
2011-11-14T06:38:33  <jix> right now I don't have any bottlenecks (nor any good AI) I just had random spikes and wanted to figure out what causes them
2011-11-14T06:38:39  <Zao> Spikes in isochronous code is suboptimal :D
2011-11-14T06:38:52  <Zao> Well, soft-realtime, I guess.
2011-11-14T06:39:13  <jix> I thought it might be the GC but well it only was the system scheduler deciding to give my visualizer more time
2011-11-14T06:39:14  <p_l> jix: attach a profiler?
2011-11-14T06:39:49  <p_l> seriously, experiment design *and* software measurement should be compulsory CS classes
2011-11-14T06:40:07  <jix> p_l: I wouldn't know how to find the cause of these random spikes with visualvm (which is the only java profile I ever used)
2011-11-14T06:40:18  <jix> *profiler
2011-11-14T06:40:30  <p_l> jix: you need to brush up your profiler-fu then
2011-11-14T06:40:49  <jix> p_l: well it was easy enough to identify the cause... I don't run my visualizer app at the same time, I don't get any spikes
2011-11-14T06:40:58  <p_l> lol
2011-11-14T06:41:54  <jix> so I guess visualvm wouldn't even be able to show this, as it only measures the time the code actually runs
2011-11-14T06:42:20  <p_l> jix: if the visualizer runs in separate process, then the spike isn't in your code
2011-11-14T06:42:23  <Varan> you could view the stacktrace at the time of the spike
2011-11-14T06:42:33  <jix> p_l: yeah it is a seperate process
2011-11-14T06:42:35  <p_l> and well... there's always OProfile and such

2011-11-14T06:43:49  <Varan> you can maybe also view gc behavior with visual vm
2011-11-14T06:43:50  <jix> Varan: I mean I measure the time a chunk of code takes.. and only after that I know there is a spike

There's an internal mailing list post from someone trying to get in contact with your Google contact; it says that you are confused about who at Google you should be speaking to
2011-11-14T08:39:48  <retybok> I guess I'll just have to wait :-/
2011-11-14T08:40:06  <amstan> jbroman: i think that was initiated by bmh
2011-11-14T08:40:16  <amstan> jbroman: he thinks we should be getting more resources
2011-11-14T08:40:21  <amstan> bmh is another googler
2011-11-14T08:40:26  <noob> is this an annual event?
2011-11-14T08:40:33  <jbroman> Yeah, bmh would match this person's initials.
2011-11-14T08:41:02  <amstan> noob: ideally we would have it every term, but development time takes a while, so we usually skip a term or 2
2011-11-14T08:41:21  <jbroman> Does j3camero not already know his contact?
2011-11-14T08:41:41  <amstan> i haven't heard from j3camero is a while
2011-11-14T08:42:20  <jbroman> I suspect that using Google's resources for this is impractical, so is it that you have insufficient dollars?
2011-11-14T08:42:51  <pairofdice> dollars = google's resources
2011-11-14T08:42:59  <amstan> jbroman: i don't know, i haven't requested this personally
2011-11-14T08:43:00  <jbroman> pairofdice: By which I meant computational resources.
2011-11-14T08:43:26  <jbroman> OK. Just odd to see an email saying "We don't know who we were talking to earlier; does anyone here know?"
2011-11-14T08:43:27  <amstan> jbroman: bmh is for getting us more money, but he also thinks we should be using google's comps(as opposed to amazon)
2011-11-14T08:44:38  <jbroman> Hmm. bmh may have a better idea how viable is than I do. But Google doesn't have a straightforward EC2 analogue, so I would think it would be tricky.
2011-11-14T08:45:05  <jbroman> Well, anyways, thanks. Just was curious what was going on.

2011-11-14T09:36:28  <UncleVasya> thanks. How to name it?

2011-11-14T09:37:02  <UncleVasya> yep, and Waterloo as organization and Canada as country.
2011-11-14T09:37:12  <amstan> sure

2011-11-14T09:41:21  <liberforce> is greedy bot really in the top 200 ?

2011-11-14T09:44:37  <Fluxid> but this will be a good way to check how many contestants that do someting are there
2011-11-14T09:44:58  <UncleVasya> Fluxid: On the Planet Wars one stock bot ended up ~1600th from total 4700 bots. So we can say there were only ~1600 real enemies.
2011-11-14T09:45:18  <Fluxid> :)
2011-11-14T09:45:36  <UncleVasya> But  310th from 4700 sounds better so real knowing is only for internal use :D

2011-11-14T10:28:06  <UncleVasya> I did this way:
2011-11-14T10:28:55  <UncleVasya> 1. When my ant want to move he checks if that square is under (possible) attack of enemy.

2011-11-14T10:33:21  <amstan> NightExcessive: runs one worker per core
2011-11-14T10:33:27  <amstan> since we have 2 cores, it'll run 2 at the same time

2011-11-14T10:33:42  <UncleVasya> Hey! I wanna to move there but I'm afraid do it alone. If someone else will attack that enemy than I will too.
2011-11-14T10:33:55  <amstan> if it's an 8 player game, it'll run 4 pairs sequencially
2011-11-14T10:34:08  <delt0r> so the bots are running on a single core at once? or sequentially?

2011-11-14T10:53:32  <Zao> rexou: 4.6 has a lot of amusing breakages for legacy code, in general.
2011-11-14T10:53:37  <mcstar> no, its a way for breaking double loops from the inside
2011-11-14T10:53:43  <Anilm3> in fact the Linux Kernel uses goto and recommends using it in some cases

2011-11-14T10:54:35  <Seeker`> goto is a good way of getting out of deep nested logic. It has its uses, but should only be used when it is clearer than doing anything else.
2011-11-14T10:55:06  <mcstar> well, after prototypingmy thing, i "functinalized" it, and voila, goto disappeared
2011-11-14T10:55:09  <Anilm3> Usually problem solving code cares little about good practices

2011-11-14T10:55:51  <mcstar> Zao: everything that is not declared otherwise, is auto
2011-11-14T10:56:14  <mcstar> thats what i know about it, thats why people never see it
2011-11-14T10:56:22  <mcstar> its like signed int
2011-11-14T10:57:16  <mcstar> so anyway, people didnt notice my benchmark
2011-11-14T10:57:22  <mcstar> 5^13 is quite many
2011-11-14T10:58:03  <mcstar> and its ~6 lines of code
2011-11-14T10:58:13  <mcstar> so im gonna replace my tree search with this new one
2011-11-14T10:58:38  <Anilm3> which one?
2011-11-14T10:59:02  <mcstar> the one i have now, a lengthier and slower recursive move generator

2011-11-14T11:49:28  <mleise> NightExcessive: Part of the problem is that floating-point values are stored as mantissa and exponent and the numbers are 'normalized'. That means they have exactly one binary digit in front of the dot (1.xxxxxx...). The actual 'magnitude' is stored in the exponent.
2011-11-14T11:50:14  <NightExcessive> Eeep. I like my 32-bit integers that are stored much more simply in RAM :)
2011-11-14T11:50:22  <mleise> A simple addition requires the the cpu get the numbers to a common exponent etc...

2011-11-14T13:35:37  <mcstar> anyone has any idea how is that stl vectors can grow as needed, yet you can access its data pointer continuously?
2011-11-14T13:35:55  <Zannick> yes, they move as needed
2011-11-14T13:36:02  <mcstar> hm
2011-11-14T13:36:11  <mcstar> what is the typical allocation size?
2011-11-14T13:36:17  <mcstar> im guessing it is overallocated
2011-11-14T13:36:19  <mcstar> i hope it is
2011-11-14T13:37:21  <Zannick> most things like that (arraylist, etc) will double in capacity when they need to grow larger
2011-11-14T13:37:31  *** Larose <Larose!~larosma@vpn.crt.umontreal.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-11-14T13:37:33  <Zannick> than their current capacity
2011-11-14T13:38:13  <mcstar> ok, but how big it is when i create such vector/array
2011-11-14T13:38:25  <mcstar> is<->it
2011-11-14T13:38:42  <mcstar> i see no mention here about that
2011-11-14T13:38:53  <mcstar> maybe starts with 1 element and doubles from that?
2011-11-14T13:39:18  <mcstar> anyway, so theres a hidden copying involved when this grows
2011-11-14T13:39:41  <janzert> mcstar: IIRC you give it an initial capacity when creating it
2011-11-14T13:39:50  <mcstar> i dont
2011-11-14T13:39:52  <mcstar> never did
2011-11-14T13:39:54  <janzert> been a while since I used C++
2011-11-14T13:39:55  <Garf> you can't access the data pointer over push_back and friends
2011-11-14T13:40:10  <Conorach> yeah I had a funny issue with that yesterday.
2011-11-14T13:40:11  <janzert> err, should have been "you can give..."
2011-11-14T13:40:11  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-14T13:40:15  <Garf> anything that potentially invokes reallocation, basically
2011-11-14T13:40:30  <mcstar> there is a .data() member function that gives you direc access
2011-11-14T13:40:43  <Conorach> I thought I would be smart: adding a Ant value type to a vector<Ant> and returning the pointer to that point.
2011-11-14T13:40:51  <Conorach> well, that turned out to fail horribly when you started adding more ants :]
2011-11-14T13:41:01  <Garf> yes, and you can't use that pointer over any operation that adds, for example
2011-11-14T13:41:09  <mcstar> Conorach: you saved the iterator?
2011-11-14T13:41:14  <mcstar> or a direct pointer?
2011-11-14T13:41:31  <Conorach> mcstar it was the address that the iterator was pointing at.
2011-11-14T13:41:40  <mcstar> Garf: i see, it wasnt clear for me what was your point
2011-11-14T13:41:43  <Conorach> I figured that was a smart way of taking the pointer to a value ;)
2011-11-14T13:41:51  <Conorach> turns out it wasn't ;)
2011-11-14T13:41:54  <mcstar> i have a lis<_ant*>

2011-11-14T13:42:15  *** Larose <Larose!~larosma@vpn.crt.umontreal.ca> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-14T13:42:22  <mcstar> just allocate dynamically your ants
2011-11-14T13:42:24  <mcstar> or whatever
2011-11-14T13:42:47  <Conorach> Yeah I changed to use Ant * instead of Ant values ;)
2011-11-14T13:43:01  <mcstar> but dont forget to free them
2011-11-14T13:43:03  <Conorach> ^^
2011-11-14T13:43:21  <Conorach> they get freed when the program ends :P
2011-11-14T13:43:29  <mcstar> i thought i might use smart pointers for that, but i managed wo it
2011-11-14T13:43:31  <Conorach> although there might be hundreds of dead ants in the memory ;)
2011-11-14T13:43:33  <mcstar> how?
2011-11-14T13:43:56  <Conorach> well, the program is running in it's own allocated space, when the application ends, it will release all memory.
2011-11-14T13:43:56  <mcstar> you have to iterate through the vector/list to delete each ant
2011-11-14T13:44:02  <mcstar> pfff
2011-11-14T13:44:04  <Conorach> :p
2011-11-14T13:44:20  <Conorach> it's not like I'm holding any resources or anything right? :/
2011-11-14T13:44:38  <Conorach> I agree it should be cleaned up properly.
2011-11-14T13:44:41  <mcstar> Conorach: in that sense c++ IS garbage collected
2011-11-14T13:44:46  <pairofdice> Tough young ants, sinewy bodies. Tiny ... toes.
2011-11-14T13:44:52  <Conorach> yeah thanks to the OS.
2011-11-14T13:45:32  <Conorach> pathplanning stuff is more important to clean.
2011-11-14T13:45:56  <Conorach> that will really explode on you on a bigger map/more ants :]
2011-11-14T13:47:08  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-14T13:47:15  <mcstar> i just reuse the board
2011-11-14T13:47:33  <mcstar> i dont really allocate anything when the bot runs
2011-11-14T13:47:53  <mcstar> only trivial auto vars, dynamically only ants
2011-11-14T13:48:18  <Conorach> yeah :( my version is horribly inefficient in many ways.
2011-11-14T13:48:27  <Conorach> probably the reason I'm not getting very far still :P
2011-11-14T13:48:45  <Conorach> even though I did spend a considerable amount of time on it in the past week :S
2011-11-14T13:48:59  <Conorach> =]
2011-11-14T13:49:10  <pairofdice> I'm letting my ants coast, enjoy the ride

2011-11-14T15:13:23  <Max___> I have a question for you: does the order of the move order matter? ie: AAA_ => _AAA, do I need to start by the right one and so on? Or it doesn't matter?
2011-11-14T15:13:54  <Yexo> where do I report bugs with the starter packages? The C# bot uses Millisecond TimeSpan.Milliseconds instead of TimeSpan.TotalMilliseconds
2011-11-14T15:13:59  <Conorach> I guess that only the ones that _end up_ in the same space die
2011-11-14T15:14:03  <Conorach> so it is all up to you :)
2011-11-14T15:14:37  <Conorach> I had ants that move to eachother's location in one turn :S
2011-11-14T15:14:39  <Conorach> that went fine
2011-11-14T15:14:41  <Max___> that what I guessed in a first place but I have a strange collision now, I am trying to understand what happened :D
2011-11-14T15:17:30  <Max___> I have a group of 13 ants and next turn, one died... but only one, I have a group of 12 ants now
2011-11-14T15:17:43  <Max___> so I don't understand how only one died...
2011-11-14T15:17:58  <g0llum> Max___, 2 ants, can't be in the same loc, so additianolly check ,if you don't send 2 ants to the same spot
2011-11-14T15:18:32  <Max___> I checked => only one ant is going to that position, and it died
2011-11-14T15:18:46  <Max___> only one victim

2011-11-14T16:00:20  <NightExcessive> Ah darn. How should I make ants block scents from diffusing? (Collaborative diffusion)
2011-11-14T16:00:32  <NightExcessive> My thought was extremely simple "ray" traces... but that doesn't seem like the best idea.
2011-11-14T16:00:41  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-14T16:00:52  <mcstar> that goes against the method's principle isnt it?
2011-11-14T16:01:13  <mcstar> the whole point of this diffusion thing is that you dont want to deal with complexity
2011-11-14T16:01:23  <mcstar> and dont want to understand whats going on
2011-11-14T16:01:24  <NightExcessive> Well, I can't think of how else to block the scents from going through ants.
2011-11-14T16:01:34  <mcstar> so you say: what the hell, lets just diffuse ant farts on the map
2011-11-14T16:01:44  <NightExcessive> Exactly.

2011-11-14T16:02:06  <NightExcessive> And not travel any further.
2011-11-14T16:02:23  <mcstar> NightExcessive: it depends how much you iterate each turn
2011-11-14T16:02:29  <mcstar> diffusion has a speed limit

2011-11-14T16:23:27  <BartV_> Hi
2011-11-14T16:24:07  <BartV_> I'm trying to compile the c++ starter package
2011-11-14T16:24:10  <yahim91> replay from game logs?
2011-11-14T16:24:26  <BartV_> but for some reason Im not getting an exe
2011-11-14T16:24:38  <Yexo> BartV_: what error messages do you get?
2011-11-14T16:24:55  <Antimony> Java isn't hard to debug if you're used to c or c++
2011-11-14T16:25:08  <BartV_> none tbh I dont really know how to do it
2011-11-14T16:25:22  <Antimony> what are you using to compile it?
2011-11-14T16:25:23  <BartV_> I've tried eclipse and wxdevcpp on windows
2011-11-14T16:25:29  <pairofdice> g++ works
2011-11-14T16:25:31  <Antimony> personally, I use Code::BLocks
2011-11-14T16:25:38  <Antimony> as my IDE
2011-11-14T16:25:52  <NightExcessive> I'm using MSVS 2010... worst decision ever.
2011-11-14T16:26:14  <Yexo> BartV_: "g++ *.cc -o yourbot.exe" works for me
2011-11-14T16:26:28  <BartV_> I made some simple c++ programs before, but they all had a main.cpp
2011-11-14T16:26:36  <pairofdice> Yeah, the lines in the readme worked for me just fine
2011-11-14T16:26:47  <mcstar> Antimony: it was a joke on the average java programmer, since it is hard for him to debug and there are many average java programmers....

2011-11-14T16:33:23  <NightExcessive> Heya.
2011-11-14T16:33:29  <pairofdice>  I have just C:\MinGW\bin
2011-11-14T16:33:45  <Conorach> I really love how this type of activity can make so many people want to try programming (or some language) for the first time in their life :P
2011-11-14T16:34:14  <pairofdice> So, you probably need the \bin there because that's where the executable is ;p
2011-11-14T16:34:18  <NightExcessive> Hehe. It made me really dive into C++ instead of just poking it with a stick occasionally.
2011-11-14T16:35:44  <pairofdice> Same, pretty soon I'm going to rewrite my bot in c++
2011-11-14T16:35:54  <Surya> I have a weird issue: the IssueOrder(antLoc, direction); sometimes doesn't work. I mean it was working fine and now, sometimes the order doesn't make the ant moves(while it's possible) Any idea? (even the obvious ones ><). I haven't modified the way of writing System.Console.Out.WriteLine("o {0} {1} {2}", loc.Row, loc.Col, direction.ToChar());
2011-11-14T16:36:07  <Conorach> well, the motivation of wanting to perform in such an awesome event will really help you overcome these obstacles that you will find in C++ :P
2011-11-14T16:36:28  <BartV_> still not recognized :(
2011-11-14T16:36:29  <Conorach> I mean, I work with that stuff every day, and I still happen upon the weiiiirdest compiler errors sometimes :/

2011-11-14T17:31:36  <jab_bott> amstan: it's described in the forum thread - but basically I modified ants.py so that it filters bot output into 'orders' and 'overlays' arrays, then it parses the orders as normal and parses the overlay commands (starting with v for visualizer instead of o for order) and pass the visualizer commands out in the replay data - then I modified the visualizer code to parse those commands and display the overlays on top of the map

2011-11-14T17:39:28  <jab_bott> amstan: I think there's more work to make it work in the realtime visualizer too before it's ready to go into the main code... in terms of disabling by default, all it does is allow bot output starting with 'v' and sends it to replay - it would be very easy to disable it by emptying the overlays array or just ignoring it so it keeps the replay clean - but really bots should not output those commands on the server anyway - so you

2011-11-14T17:40:21  <mikewintermute> going through the tutorial and the Java code seems to be missing a visible() method. anyone run into this too?
2011-11-14T17:40:53  <NightExcessive> Anilm3: I've yet to find a good way to fix it. My temporary fix was making the ants diffuse away a negative value.
2011-11-14T17:41:06  <jab_bott> Anilm3: have your goal field/heatmap or whatever it is you're using stop when it gets to a stronger field, instead of continuing in an additive fashion
2011-11-14T17:41:31  <NightExcessive> jab_bott: I'll try that
2011-11-14T17:41:45  <Anilm3> jab_bott: that's what I thought
2011-11-14T17:41:55  <jab_bott> Anilm3: that way the 'valley' between goals will always have higher-value squares adjacent to it
2011-11-14T17:42:35  <Anilm3> jab_bott: are you using cd?
2011-11-14T17:43:24  <yahim91> mikewintermute: i think there is a method called isVisible()

2011-11-14T17:44:23  <NightExcessive> mikewintermute: I may be able to port the C++ visibility check to Java a bit later if you need.
2011-11-14T17:47:13  <jab_bott> Anilm3: oh - no I don't thinks so - I'm just making stuff up mostly.. I'm doing ai-class.com so learning some techniques from there, haven't heard of collaborative diffusion though.. sounds like some kind of gaussian blur on a heat-map, which seems like a good idea... I'm currently using something similar to make my ants explore
2011-11-14T17:47:50  <amstan> jab_bott: what ai-class technique? i haven't seen much in there except chapter 2 that's relevant to ants

2011-11-14T17:50:31  <jab_bott> amstan: some of the value iteration stuff looks interesting - I think my food maps which are generated from a breadth first search actually behave a bit like a policy.. tbh, I'm really just making stuff up, struggling with how to make my ants explore without getting stuck atm. I've only got food gathering and basic exploration sorted so far... attack and defence are a way off yet
2011-11-14T17:51:21  <mikewintermute> NightExcessive: just downloaded C++ starter package. Bot.cc only has 61 lines.
2011-11-14T17:51:39  <NightExcessive> mikewintermute: Oh, sorry. State.cc. Same lines.
2011-11-14T17:51:57  <amstan> mikewintermute: remember that you can edit the starter packages, feel free to add the isVisible
2011-11-14T17:52:25  <Yexo> jab_bott: you can do exploring the same way you do food. A breadth first search starting from all unknown (or invisible) tiles
2011-11-14T17:53:11  <jab_bott> Anilm3: Check out my exploration visualization here: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1633&start=50 - it's based on additive fields around the ants and it doesn't work very well :/

2011-11-14T17:53:34  <underflow> (print variables etc...)
2011-11-14T17:53:39  <treeform> aichallenge is not a debugger
2011-11-14T17:53:50  <jab_bott> Yexo: wouldn't that be waaay too slow? there's lots more of those than ants or foods
2011-11-14T17:53:51  <treeform> you can write to std error and supply --log_error
2011-11-14T17:54:00  <Yexo> that doesn't matter
2011-11-14T17:54:10  <Yexo> there are maximum 200x200 =40k tiles
2011-11-14T17:54:20  <Yexo> you only need to visit each to those once in a BFS

2011-11-14T17:56:50  <jab_bott> Yexo: bit if you need to do that from all/each unexplored tile - even just the ones on the edge of your expolored range - that's a lot
2011-11-14T17:57:23  <Yexo> one BFS can have multiple source tiles
2011-11-14T17:57:35  <Yexo> you don't need to start a separate BFS for every unknown tile
2011-11-14T17:57:49  <jab_bott> Yexo: ahhh, interesting!!
2011-11-14T17:58:01  <thestinger> Yexo: nice point :)
2011-11-14T17:58:06  <rintaun> that is an interesting point
2011-11-14T17:58:26  <Anilm3> jab_bott: thx, interesting
2011-11-14T17:58:45  <jab_bott> Yexo: but surely if you start on all of them, they're already 'explored' (by the BFS) and so won't be visited again - do you need to pick a selection and search from those?
2011-11-14T17:59:33  <Yexo> no, the bfs doesn't mark tiles as "explorered", it just stores the distances from the closest unknown tile
2011-11-14T17:59:48  <Yexo> ie all unknown tiles get value 1, all tiles at the edge of your visibility get value 1 etc.
2011-11-14T18:00:03  <Yexo> your ants look around them and pick the lowest value

2011-11-14T18:01:45  <NightExcessive> IIRC it's ants.enemyAnts()
2011-11-14T18:02:01  <jab_bott> Yexo: not sure exactly what you mean, but you've certainly given me some ideas to go and try - I think if I make a list of previously-unexplored but now-visible-and-land tiles that should give me the edge of my explored field and I can start from there
2011-11-14T18:02:35  <thestinger> t2027: don't pass it 'self' as an argument - that's implicitly given as the first argument for class methods
2011-11-14T18:02:53  <NightExcessive> thestinger: Only if you use a semicolon
2011-11-14T18:03:07  <Zannick> what? no, you never need semicolons in python

2011-11-14T18:04:28  <thestinger> t2027: if a class method is defined as 'def method(self, arg):', you use it by passing it 1 argument - the method you're using doesn't take any arguments
2011-11-14T18:04:38  <Zannick> you probably want self.enemy_ants()
2011-11-14T18:05:25  <Zannick> the terminology is confusing here - a classmethod is defined as '@classmethod\n def method(cls, args)'
2011-11-14T18:05:40  <thestinger> yeah, used the wrong term
2011-11-14T18:05:52  <thestinger> should have said 'method'
2011-11-14T18:06:24  <Zannick> but yes, if it's defined as def method(self, ...) in the class, then you call it by self.method(...)

2011-11-14T18:24:15  <a1k0n> it's too bad it's not using a whole-history ranking update

2011-11-14T18:26:52  <jab_bott> amstan: got to laugh at this comment: "So, a worthless, manipulated currency. Gotcha." - so just the same as traditional fiat currencies then
2011-11-14T18:27:04  <Zannick> hahaha
2011-11-14T18:27:44  <amstan> jab_bott: well.. it's just that it would be nice to have properly backed bitcoin
2011-11-14T18:28:10  <jab_bott> amstan: isn't the main benefit of bitcoin that it's not 'properly backed'?
2011-11-14T18:28:24  <amstan> by backed i mean supported
2011-11-14T18:28:29  <amstan> and used
2011-11-14T18:28:37  <Zannick> having a large company back it is not the intent at all of a distributed currency
2011-11-14T18:28:54  <thestinger> amstan: bitcoin is used... for currency speculation :P
2011-11-14T18:29:14  <amstan> as in.. get bitcoins for adsense, offer bitcoins via google checkout and a bunch of others
2011-11-14T18:29:35  <thestinger> I think most of the people 'using' it are just mining and selling them to people who think the value will go up :\
2011-11-14T18:29:44  <retybok_> a1k0n: at least your bot's behavior is pretty original compared to others
2011-11-14T18:29:45  <Zannick> bitcoins for ads would be...interesting

2011-11-14T18:30:56  <jab_bott> yeah - they'd just devise one they can track and control
2011-11-14T18:31:44  <NightExcessive> Well if they wanted to they could mine Bitcoins at insane rates.

2011-11-14T18:32:48  <amstan> design a contest that looks like an ordinary game, but in reality is a way to mine for bitcoins

2011-11-14T18:34:22  <jab_bott> problem is, "The Economy" only works by unsustainable exponential growth, and sensible ideas like eudebtwriteoff.com are against the grain on this - the banks who skim off millions on all those interest payments floating around and being  converted to different currencies would never allow it

2011-11-14T19:17:48  <iwantwin> when putting it in default package (or, no package definition) make.cmd works perfectly fine

2011-11-14T19:32:57  <grom358> ah I see.. yeah so your main file has to be called MyBot.java
2011-11-14T19:33:53  <grom358> it kind of looks like you can't have folders.. and therefore packages .. Could be wrong.. only skimming through this code

2011-11-14T19:36:10  <iwantwin> im just moving it in package while programming and moving it in default package for making.. i guess

2011-11-14T19:54:00  <NightExcessive> How should I go about goal obfuscation? (Making the ants "vacuum the scents" to prevent multiple ants from engaging in one objective)
2011-11-14T19:54:40  <amstan> NightExcessive: what if the ant you originally sent for food dies?
2011-11-14T19:54:58  <NightExcessive> amstan: Its vacuum will no longer exist, so another ant will grab the goal.

2011-11-14T19:59:58  <NightExcessive> Wrote my own line algorithm... and then found out about Bresenham's line algorithm.
2011-11-14T20:00:52  <Antimony> the way I do it is
2011-11-14T20:01:02  <Antimony> when expanding a node near the ant, increase the distance by more than 1
2011-11-14T20:02:15  <NightExcessive> So essentially lower the coefficient by small amounts?
2011-11-14T20:02:26  <thestinger> Antimony: that's what I do atm, I increase it by 3 instead of 1
2011-11-14T20:02:59  <NightExcessive> I use the algorithm from the published article, so it's not currently directly dependent on any kind of distances :x
2011-11-14T20:03:20  <Antimony> what article? You arne't talking about that stupid diffusion thing are you?
2011-11-14T20:03:40  <NightExcessive> Indeed I am. http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf
2011-11-14T20:04:57  <Antimony> by the way, the actual term for that is Influence Maps, but the authors were apparently not aware of common AI practice

2011-11-14T20:33:05  <grom358> got A* and BFS going
2011-11-14T20:33:20  <grom358> and my ant does reasonable.. same of the times
2011-11-14T20:33:49  <grom358> I recently changed to trade ant for an ant... lots like my bot doing worse
2011-11-14T20:34:49  <iwantwin> grom: trade ant for an ant? what you mean by that?
2011-11-14T20:35:55  <grom358> like.. I have code where an ant will avoid other ants.. But now if its only one ant.. I will still move towards my goal.. so if that ant doesn't move away.. Means both ants die
2011-11-14T20:38:48  <grom358> well not sure if it is doing worse yet.. need more sample games.. My rank still increasing.. Yet to see if it gets higher than my previous version
2011-11-14T20:39:02  <grom358> rank 296 and climbing
2011-11-14T20:39:16  <grom358> with zero combat
2011-11-14T20:40:03  <magiik> avoidance is a type of combat
2011-11-14T20:43:49  <grom358> yeah.. I guess it kind of is. But its the weakest form
2011-11-14T20:44:08  <grom358> I need to like get my other ants to group up and kill them off
2011-11-14T20:45:02  <grom358> try and make it so get the food and not lose ants in the process

2011-11-14T20:45:37  <grom358> and my ants tend to go single file towards enemy hills
2011-11-14T20:45:48  <iwantwin> but ive been using a* before and have some ideas for strategies
2011-11-14T20:45:55  <grom358> so I can lose 30 ants to good placement by the enemy
2011-11-14T20:45:57  <iwantwin> i even tried to put my ideas at use at first..
2011-11-14T20:46:24  <grom358> iwantwin: I got A* implement.. but its barely used so far.. cause A* requires start and end points
2011-11-14T20:46:40  <iwantwin> but now im first putting a lot of effort trying to make the starterpack usefull or more object oriented:D
2011-11-14T20:46:54  <iwantwin> in either case im storing more data then before^^
2011-11-14T20:47:01  <iwantwin> and gameplay is still the same=D
2011-11-14T20:47:15  <iwantwin> ehm.. we do have start and end poitns right?
2011-11-14T20:47:28  <grom358> Yeah I got heaps of state that I store.. water tiles, when last seen a tile, etc etc
2011-11-14T20:47:58  <grom358> what I really need though, is getting my ants to work together in combat

2011-11-14T20:58:47  <avdg> I already heard migi32 complaining that the bots are getting better
2011-11-14T20:58:59  <avdg> and his bot was getting 8th
2011-11-14T20:59:25  <Rinum> at least those in the top tier
2011-11-14T20:59:25  <Rinum> the bots are definitely getting better
2011-11-14T20:59:25  <Rinum> lol
2011-11-14T20:59:46  <avdg> maybe, check the ones who are updated

2011-11-14T21:00:28  <avdg> so that situation changed

2011-11-14T21:04:23  <avdg> even mine? :p
2011-11-14T21:04:27  <grom358> and as newer version are uploaded gonna get smashed
2011-11-14T21:04:32  <avdg> its almost always losing
2011-11-14T21:04:34  <Rinum> grom358: yeah, fluxid bots are waaay too good
2011-11-14T21:04:58  <avdg> well, its still a good benchmark if you don't get too emotional about it
2011-11-14T21:05:34  <Rinum> based on my exp w/ fluxid, a skill ~37 results in skill ~63 on aichallenge... at least based on my bot
2011-11-14T21:05:56  <avdg> mine does just hit 30
2011-11-14T21:06:03  <Rinum> so I guess if you can manage to get a skill ~45-ish, you should be top 100 material

2011-11-14T21:14:48  <bmh> Rinum: sure. I'm going to modify my ants to be state machines and have an 'infectious' warband state that spreads to adjacent ants
2011-11-14T21:15:14  <Rinum> nice

2011-11-14T21:18:07  <pedrosorio> it's really terrible when you have an awesome thing, tweak it, but then can't get it to do any better
2011-11-14T21:18:08  <iwantwin> avdg: with real changes
2011-11-14T21:18:28  <avdg> iwantwin: don't believe in real changes, my commits rarely have real changes ;-)
2011-11-14T21:18:36  <pedrosorio> I kind of want to try and make a real bot
2011-11-14T21:18:40  <Rinum> xathis: btw, congrats on maintaining your solid lead thus far!
2011-11-14T21:18:45  <avdg> the only thing that counts is that you are committing regularly
2011-11-14T21:18:45  <iwantwin> avdg: every change improves the tutorial bot:O
2011-11-14T21:18:56  <xathis> bmh: no magic, just a lot of bfs searches and some combat logic
2011-11-14T21:18:57  <pedrosorio> but I'm too busy trying to finish my thesis and develop an Octave bot that doesn't time out
2011-11-14T21:19:16  <avdg> iwantwin: yeah, but doesn't mean your bot actually get better by every commit, just on long term
2011-11-14T21:19:18  <pedrosorio> xathis: "and some combat logic"

2011-11-14T21:20:44  <xathis> pedrosorio: i actually found two big bugs in my combat and i have a version that can handle much more ants, but it looks like the bugs are part of the caracter of my bot, fixing them doesn't necessarily result in better games
2011-11-14T21:20:46  <avdg> gn
2011-11-14T21:21:27  <xathis> Rinum: a lot of the other top ones are dangerous
2011-11-14T21:21:28  <pedrosorio> xathis: exactly, bug fixing that turns out to be "feature removing" =P
2011-11-14T21:21:37  <avdg> xathis: I wonder if you reached a point where you have to make more decisions between tasks

2011-11-14T21:24:39  <avdg> well, that your bot requires better and tougher decisions
2011-11-14T21:24:42  <grom358> xathis: do you cache path information? or recalculate that sort of thing every turn.
2011-11-14T21:24:50  <xathis> _flag: but you're doing good on tcp :)
2011-11-14T21:25:47  <xathis> grom358: i save destination information between the turns, but calculate the path again every turn. but not all of my ants go to some destination

2011-11-14T21:27:13  <avdg> hmm, I wonder how fast the bots of you guys are running every turn, mine doesn't reach 30 ms atm (but its also almost doing nothing)
2011-11-14T21:27:48  <u_> mine does nothing but move all its ants west and it takes 20 ms for one ant...
2011-11-14T21:28:00  <NightExcessive_> My CD bot was taking in excess of 100ms every turn before I gave up on it.
2011-11-14T21:28:08  <avdg> well, mine can do 400 in that time span
2011-11-14T21:28:26  <avdg> but again, its almost doing nothing, except some information tracking

2011-11-14T21:28:41  <yoden> on my macbook
2011-11-14T21:28:43  <u_> actually, it's 1/5 of a ms

2011-11-14T21:33:52  <avdg> if it doesn't scale, its borken ;-) (unless you don't need the scale)
2011-11-14T21:34:20  <NightExcessive_> xathis: Is your bot state-based?
2011-11-14T21:34:28  <avdg> and the last thing I want to see except a crash is a time out
2011-11-14T21:35:03  <xathis> NightExcessive_: you mean if i save information in between turns?
2011-11-14T21:35:34  <NightExcessive_> xathis: Well, do you give each bot a state (role?)
2011-11-14T21:35:55  <Antimony> currently, in the last test my bot peaked around 50ms without doing anythign fancy
2011-11-14T21:36:14  <Antimony> it could be a lot more once I get combat implemented
2011-11-14T21:36:14  <avdg> hmm, mine idles at 0/1ms
2011-11-14T21:36:16  <bmh> Pro-tip: Telling your bots to run toward your hill is generally not what you want them to do.
2011-11-14T21:36:29  <xathis> NightExcessive_: ah, uhm not really, at the beginning of each turn i decide for each ant what to do
2011-11-14T21:36:43  <NightExcessive_> xathis: Ah.
2011-11-14T21:36:53  <yoden> combat is hard
2011-11-14T21:37:04  <yoden> i can't think of a good way to do it besides pasting together hacks and heuristics :(
2011-11-14T21:37:07  <Antimony> interesting
2011-11-14T21:37:29  <avdg> yoden: information tracking?
2011-11-14T21:37:33  <bmh> yoden: a1k0n fully solved some positions :)
2011-11-14T21:37:40  <Antimony> most of the 50ms seems to be spent doing routine updates
2011-11-14T21:37:57  <xathis> NightExcessive_: but if the ant has nothing special to do and had a destination given in a prior turn, it follows that route
2011-11-14T21:38:04  <yoden> well, fully solving or trying to do some sort of alpha-beta...
2011-11-14T21:38:07  <yoden> doesn't really scale :\

2011-11-14T21:38:28  <Antimony> my plan for combat is to assume all enemies are stationary
2011-11-14T21:38:34  <Antimony> it's better than nothing
2011-11-14T21:38:46  <Antimony> but I haven't even got that implemented yet
2011-11-14T21:38:49  <bmh> xathis: I'm thinking of keeping around my old diffusion grid and adding it to the new grid after penalizing the whole thing
2011-11-14T21:38:50  <bugnuts> if your gathering is good enough maybe you can time them all out.

2011-11-14T21:39:11  <thestinger> Antimony: yep, I started working on that but it's not done, keep getting distracted by random tweaks, bugs and tiny features
2011-11-14T21:39:20  <xathis> NightExcessive_: yes, even if the destination stays the same, i recalculate the path via A*. I don't have any time problems, even with long distance searches
2011-11-14T21:39:27  <Antimony> I recalculate food dsitances every turn. It usually takes up to 10ms depending on how much searching needs to be done
2011-11-14T21:39:36  <avdg> thestinger: do you test your bot regularly?
2011-11-14T21:39:45  <yoden> yeah, a good a* impl is so fast on these small boards, no reason to store paths
2011-11-14T21:39:47  <thestinger> avdg: yes, I'm strcat :)
2011-11-14T21:40:01  <thestinger> avdg: I implement every new feature/change in a branch, and test it before merging
2011-11-14T21:40:05  <bmh> cool, my ant actually plays well until it times out
2011-11-14T21:40:06  <Antimony> I find that TCP is not very useful for testing. There's not enough food and too many timeouts
2011-11-14T21:40:08  <avdg> I've tested it hard enough so I can't get new bugs easily without modifying the core code
2011-11-14T21:40:13  <thestinger> combat isn't done, so I can't really test much yet :P
2011-11-14T21:40:22  <yoden> thestinger: quit killing my bot :>

2011-11-14T21:41:45  <thestinger> that's what my combat code is like
2011-11-14T21:42:00  <thestinger> it's just a massive blob of spaghetti code atm with no testing xD

2011-11-14T21:42:42  <avdg> well, I'm not really testing my code to be honest, I'm just asking myself it that piece of code gets executed and how it affects its behavior
2011-11-14T21:43:30  <avdg> the more and clearer it affects the behavior, the more bugs you can find
2011-11-14T21:43:55  <avdg> and in some cases, just unit test or manual debugging
2011-11-14T21:45:04  <thestinger> I like watching A slaughter my ants

2011-11-14T21:45:51  <grom358> xathis: I also have A* but I tend not to use it.. because say there is food.. How do you know which ant to path to that food.. To find that out I use BFS.. which calculates the path. So I only need A* when I need to recalculate a path for some reason
2011-11-14T21:46:38  <yoden> it'll be interesting to do some tests afterwards...
2011-11-14T21:46:39  <NightExcessive_> grom358: I just grab the closest ant using Manhattan distance :)
2011-11-14T21:46:47  <yoden> my a* variant allows reusing partially solved boards
2011-11-14T21:46:47  <NightExcessive_> It fails me sometimes because of the mazes.
2011-11-14T21:47:00  <yoden> but it might be more complicated and therefore slower than just running BFS :X
2011-11-14T21:47:04  <grom358> NightExcessive: yes that is why I use BFS.. Manhattan distance fails
2011-11-14T21:47:07  <thestinger> NightExcessive_: how many ants do you run manhattan distance for?
2011-11-14T21:47:30  <NightExcessive_> thestinger: All of them, every turn.
2011-11-14T21:47:34  <thestinger> running BFS from a food across the _entire_ map and storing all the distances (which can be reused for pathfinding) was faster for me than the way the tutorial does it
2011-11-14T21:47:44  <xathis> grom358: for collection food i don't use A* as well, but i use it to move my ants away from the hill
2011-11-14T21:48:01  <thestinger> and it gets you "real" distance (you have to make assumptions about unseen areas) instead of manhattan distance
2011-11-14T21:48:55  <thestinger> my food code is completely different now b/c I don't send multiple ants to get a few food that are right next to each other
2011-11-14T21:49:32  <grom358> my food collection works well.. I use 1 ant to collect cluster of food
2011-11-14T21:49:40  <NightExcessive_> thestinger: How many times do you run a BFS per turn?
2011-11-14T21:50:11  <grom358> using BFS per food tile.. capped to 30 tile depth
2011-11-14T21:50:38  <thestinger> well, "once" for attacking or searching for enemy hills (but I do it from each enemy hill and unseen location)
2011-11-14T21:50:44  <thestinger> once per food tile
2011-11-14T21:51:10  <thestinger> and then I use BFS a bunch more for various other heuristics/minor features
2011-11-14T21:51:40  <NightExcessive_> thestinger: So you use a few of them, but with multiple seeds?
2011-11-14T21:51:53  <NightExcessive_> (Multiple seeds for each search)
2011-11-14T21:52:14  <thestinger> NightExcessive_: well, I actually didn't implement it that way, but that's basically what I'm doing
2011-11-14T21:52:54  <NightExcessive_> thestinger: Ah.
2011-11-14T21:53:55  <thestinger> most of my breadth-first searches are slightly altered to store various things they find along the way, so my codebase is sort of a pile of graph searches atm
2011-11-14T21:54:42  <yoden> graph search is easy
2011-11-14T21:54:45  <yoden> actual combat is hard :X
2011-11-14T21:55:02  <thestinger> yeah :)
2011-11-14T21:55:33  <NightExcessive_> Yeah. Tactical planning is the hardest.
2011-11-14T21:55:40  <yoden> literally all i have is a* with different starts and goals
2011-11-14T21:55:45  <yoden> and various configurations :X
2011-11-14T21:56:28  <NightExcessive_> Sounds about like me. Mostly because I'm working on implementing D*-Lite now.

2011-11-14T22:05:48  <a1k0n> xathis: the problem with alpha-beta is it assumes there aren't simultaneous turns
2011-11-14T22:06:08  <a1k0n> i implemented it as an experiment on a 2v1 scenario, 3x7 map, totally solved it with dynamic programming
2011-11-14T22:06:32  <a1k0n> if the 1 can see the 2 ants moves first, then it can always prevent the 2 from killing it without losing any ants

2011-11-14T22:06:47  <a1k0n> i do, but i did this in C++

2011-11-14T22:09:23  <a1k0n> anyway yeah my ants tend to get trapped in the little 1x1 'holes' in the walls of the maze maps because they don't look more than one step ahead
2011-11-14T22:09:56  <xathis> have you done it the other way around? so if you have two ants and there's one enemy?

2011-11-14T22:10:48  <roflmao> yeah the way the ants move
2011-11-14T22:10:49  <a1k0n> you mean when foraging?
2011-11-14T22:10:53  <a1k0n> or attacking?
2011-11-14T22:10:57  <roflmao> nah, they seem to march to battle then sparse when forage
2011-11-14T22:11:02  <roflmao> creates a sort of spasm effect methinks
2011-11-14T22:11:05  <a1k0n> heh
2011-11-14T22:12:03  <a1k0n> i think my code is buggy.. it makes way too many 1 for 1 trades of ants
2011-11-14T22:12:17  <roflmao> not necessarily buggy
2011-11-14T22:12:18  <a1k0n> havent figured that out

2011-11-14T22:13:50  <a1k0n> yeah the 20:1 thing is temporary.  really it should depend on how many ants you have and how many you think your enemy has

2011-11-14T22:15:32  <avdg> mine would be statistic based

2011-11-14T22:18:07  <bmh> NightExcessive_: yes.
2011-11-14T22:18:43  <bmh> NightExcessive_: if I was doing this in C, there would be no issue.
2011-11-14T22:18:58  <NightExcessive_> bmh: Wrote mine in C# (not sure why)
2011-11-14T22:19:05  <a1k0n> my method is really elegant, so i'm kinda bummed it doesn't beat A or xathis :)
2011-11-14T22:20:02  <roflmao> sounds like it
2011-11-14T22:20:11  <avdg> hmm, I wonder how close I would get to diffusion, but it would be rather a more controlled version and much faster
2011-11-14T22:20:30  <avdg> at least, if I implement it in a faster language
2011-11-14T22:20:38  <bmh> NightExcessive_: how many times can you update your automata?
2011-11-14T22:21:05  <NightExcessive_> bmh: I made mine one-pass... but to work properly I also have to go through *every* cell afterwards and run a diffuse function.
2011-11-14T22:21:25  <bmh> yeah. I'm trying to run my diffuse function 40 times, but I can't do it on big maps
2011-11-14T22:21:46  <u_> what are you diffusing, the scent of food?
2011-11-14T22:21:56  <a1k0n> run it five times and keep it between frames?
2011-11-14T22:22:14  <a1k0n> seriously like bfs is a lot easier
2011-11-14T22:22:17  <bmh> a1k0n: yeah, that's what I'm trying to convince Eric to implement. I don't want to write code tonight :)
2011-11-14T22:22:37  <avdg> I don't want to use my code I've just written :p
2011-11-14T22:22:53  <a1k0n> you are destined for managerhood
2011-11-14T22:23:06  <NightExcessive_> bmh: It took me the past day to get my one-pass method semi-working :P
2011-11-14T22:23:07  <avdg> 65 lines in beta
2011-11-14T22:23:31  <bmh> ok, my foraging is apparently pretty darn good, but my combat is horrendous
2011-11-14T22:23:37  <NightExcessive_> It still gets caught on really "simple" things though. :(
2011-11-14T22:23:37  <avdg> actually 64 added and 1 removed
2011-11-14T22:23:51  <a1k0n> that was good enough for 20th place a few weeks ago
2011-11-14T22:27:07  <NightExcessive_> bmh: How did you solve areas between goals having higher values than the actual goals?
2011-11-14T22:27:34  <bmh> NightExcessive_: I don't.
2011-11-14T22:28:04  <NightExcessive_> bmh: Then how do you keep ants from getting stuck there?
2011-11-14T22:28:25  <avdg> NightExcessive_: there isn't a lot to do except prioritizing, adjusting reward values or leaving it in the current state
2011-11-14T22:28:35  <bmh> NightExcessive_: I don't.
2011-11-14T22:28:57  <avdg> hmm, use distance to wall as penalty?
2011-11-14T22:29:05  <NightExcessive_> bmh: Hum. Well that's been a major problem for me. :[
2011-11-14T22:29:39  <avdg> (well, you don't have to calculate it for every tile, just the ones that are close enough to a wall)

2011-11-14T22:31:26  <NightExcessive_> avdg: The problem is on maps like the tutorial map where you have multiple pieces of food. Using the formula specified in the collaborative diffusion paper, the area between the food has a higher value than the food itself... and since the ants use hill climbing, they just sit there going "yay, I made it to a goal!"
2011-11-14T22:31:38  <Raimondi> NightExcessive_: I got that problem and it turned out the diffusion coefficient was too high.

2011-11-14T22:34:30  <avdg> NightExcessive_: hmm, I would assume that every reached goal would be removed, so in that case, you could fix it temp with a random move

2011-11-14T22:34:53  <avdg> there might be of course something better to really fix the issue
2011-11-14T22:35:20  <NightExcessive_> avdg: They simply iterate over the four adjacent squares and move to the one with the highest value. If none have a higher value, they stay on the current square. I'm thinking I just need to get better math.
2011-11-14T22:35:25  <bmh> roflmao: I'm going to do just that to save recomputation costs
2011-11-14T22:35:57  <avdg> I wonder if there is a case (except combat) where staying is more rewarding
2011-11-14T22:36:09  <grom358> the problem with always avoiding enemy ants is.. you run away from food and let them get it
2011-11-14T22:36:10  <NightExcessive_> roflmao: My implementation is based around just that. It creates a BFS map from each source and goes outward.
2011-11-14T22:36:30  <roflmao> oh so by diffusion you mean a simple bfs map?
2011-11-14T22:37:07  <NightExcessive_> roflmao: Nonono. It uses a BFS map to get the surrounding area and diffuses over the cells from the BFS map.
2011-11-14T22:37:10  <grom358> NightExcessive: but doing it like that.. how do you avoid multiple ants going to the same food?
2011-11-14T22:37:40  <NightExcessive_> grom358: That would happen by goal obfuscation, which I haven't implemented yet. Basically: An ant sucks up the scent around it like a vacuum.
2011-11-14T22:37:50  <bmh> grom358: in my diffusion scheme my ants diffuse ant smell which gobbles up the food smell
2011-11-14T22:38:00  <NightExcessive_> Yeah.
2011-11-14T22:38:09  <NightExcessive_> I planned to just have ants give off a negative diffusion.
2011-11-14T22:38:21  <Antimony> In my bot, I use regular A* but with goal obfuscation
2011-11-14T22:38:26  <Antimony> it works pretty well
2011-11-14T22:38:41  <roflmao> I simply use the tut code for matching up ant to food
2011-11-14T22:38:50  <roflmao> then use a simple bfs food map to do the actual pathfinding
2011-11-14T22:39:10  <grom358> the tutorial uses manhattan distance does it not?
2011-11-14T22:39:20  <bmh> I believe so

2011-11-14T23:04:04  <bmh> OpenBSD </troll>
2011-11-14T23:04:12  <avdg> debian'ish, though I haven't use many distrubutions
2011-11-14T23:04:15  <TheLinker> debian sid
2011-11-14T23:04:29  <avdg> I hope I can as get better informed
2011-11-14T23:05:12  * avdg would wonder how many people here would prefer windows :p
2011-11-14T23:05:20  <grom358> It was ubuntu.. but I hate Unity and Gnome 3
2011-11-14T23:05:28  <a1k0n> burn the heretic!
2011-11-14T23:05:32  <NightExcessive_> grom358: Same. I switched to openSUSE.
2011-11-14T23:05:32  <magiik> i dont mind using either
2011-11-14T23:05:49  <roflmao> ubuntu
2011-11-14T23:06:04  <roflmao> with gnu
2011-11-14T23:06:12  <roflmao> err gnoam
2011-11-14T23:06:17  <roflmao> (i little durnk)
2011-11-14T23:06:18  <thestinger> @gnu ubuntu
2011-11-14T23:06:18  <contestbot> thestinger: GNU/ubuntu
2011-11-14T23:06:22  <avdg> I'm currently on os x, but my other laptop (which died) has ubuntu
2011-11-14T23:06:28  <magiik> roflmao: program drunk 2?
2011-11-14T23:06:40  <magiik> i find i can program about up until drunk
2011-11-14T23:06:40  <roflmao> ye
2011-11-14T23:06:42  <roflmao> s
2011-11-14T23:06:48  <TheLinker> LFS? anyone?
2011-11-14T23:06:50  <thestinger> Arch is my distro of choice atm
2011-11-14T23:07:05  <avdg> I would like to try arch :-)
2011-11-14T23:07:19  <thestinger> I use Debian on my server, but only because it works and I'm much too lazy to change something that works fine and doesn't bother me at all
2011-11-14T23:07:30  <avdg> well, I used like 5 min, but I don't know enough how to adjust it atm
2011-11-14T23:08:22  <NightExcessive_> Oooo. Arch looks shiney. (I've never heard of it before now)
2011-11-14T23:08:39  <avdg> arch is very primitive ;-)
2011-11-14T23:08:47  <magiik> thestinger: ur not stinger from utonet are you?
2011-11-14T23:08:51  <thestinger> nope
2011-11-14T23:09:23  <NightExcessive_> avdg: Primitive is shiney nowadays... I hate the amount of stuff Ubuntu comes packed with.
2011-11-14T23:09:29  *** NightExcessive_ is now known as NightExcessive
2011-11-14T23:09:47  <avdg> well yeah, I'm not telling its a bad thing
2011-11-14T23:10:04  <avdg> but I wouldn't suggest it to many people
2011-11-14T23:10:19  <avdg> just because of its type of simplicity
2011-11-14T23:10:30  <NightExcessive> Ah
2011-11-14T23:10:52  <bmh> I don't care what distro it's running, as long as I can have my xmonad
2011-11-14T23:11:29  <NightExcessive> xmonad?
2011-11-14T23:11:41  <grom358> ah.. xmonad.. I really should try use it
2011-11-14T23:11:43  <avdg> I currently only care about a gui to run a browser and few apps (but it doesn't have to be shiny, though it has to be simple) and a good cli env with good tools
2011-11-14T23:11:50  <bmh> NightExcessive: it's a tiling window manager. It makes using a computer bearable.
2011-11-14T23:11:58  <thestinger> Arch ships the latest stable upstream releases, and generally there are no patches applied to software - that's mostly what I like
2011-11-14T23:12:01  <magiik> damn u can battle through water... interesting for those maze maps
2011-11-14T23:12:23  <avdg> yeah, the water only limits movements
2011-11-14T23:12:41  <magiik> hrm..... that kinda changes things
2011-11-14T23:12:48  <thestinger> you can get the same with Debian, but bleeding edge debian isn't nearly as stable as Arch in my experience and the package management isn't as nice
2011-11-14T23:12:49  <bmh> can you drown your own ants?
2011-11-14T23:12:53  <u_> nope
2011-11-14T23:12:57  <u_> they just refuse to move
2011-11-14T23:12:58  <bmh> that's a shame.
2011-11-14T23:12:58  <magiik> i was using a diffusiony map kinda thing
2011-11-14T23:13:03  <magiik> that changes things.... a lot hrm....
2011-11-14T23:13:04  <NightExcessive> Oh god. I couldn't stand xmonad... preference, I suppose.
2011-11-14T23:13:13  <magiik> i guess i needed to revamp the battle code anyways
2011-11-14T23:13:26  <bmh> NightExcessive: I think that OSX has the most awful window manager known to man (as I type on my macbook)
2011-11-14T23:13:38  <roflmao> i think i need to stop progrmming my ant while mentally impaired
2011-11-14T23:13:40  <NightExcessive> bmh: I agree.
2011-11-14T23:13:44  <roflmao> i think i might jnust me making it wrose
2011-11-14T23:13:56  <avdg> I wish osx had a little bit more useful spotlight though
2011-11-14T23:13:57  <bmh> roflmao: turn on spellcheck and stop drinking on monday night
2011-11-14T23:13:59  * bmh puts down the wine
2011-11-14T23:14:05  <avdg> dunno if its better on lion
2011-11-14T23:14:23  <NightExcessive> My personal favorite is X11+KDE
2011-11-14T23:14:31  <avdg> (and I don't want an other one installed parallel with it)
2011-11-14T23:14:33  <bmh> Drinking increases your chances of getting k-lined a billion percent.
2011-11-14T23:14:50  <thestinger> NightExcessive: I use i3 now, dwm-style tags and layouts (awesome, xmonad, etc.) annoy me too much
2011-11-14T23:16:24  <u_> can i issue a "stay still" order by replacing NESW with ' '?
2011-11-14T23:16:34  <bmh> u_: just don't issue an order
2011-11-14T23:16:45  <u_> bmh: it's convienent..
2011-11-14T23:16:59  <bmh> u_: abstract harder :)

2011-11-14T23:18:25  <avdg> well, I have to go as well *takes laptop and moves*
2011-11-14T23:18:44  <u_> hope it won't fire me for that
2011-11-14T23:18:58  <a1k0n> u_: so when outputting moves, if(order == '-') return;
2011-11-14T23:19:16  <a1k0n> er ' '.  i use -.  heh.
2011-11-14T23:21:50  <grom358> we get to see the code to top 100 bots after it finishes?
2011-11-14T23:22:08  <grom358> cause if I don't get combat going.. I really want to see how its done lol
2011-11-14T23:22:18  <a1k0n> i'm sure many will release theirs.  i certainly will.
