2012-02-21T08:28:57  <mcstar> i didnt know that
2012-02-21T08:29:00  <mcstar> why?
2012-02-21T08:29:25  <mcstar> did norvig tell sebastina's wife about their relationship?

2012-02-21T08:32:29  <mcstar> thx
2012-02-21T08:33:15  <mcstar> pairofdice: you took aiclass right?
2012-02-21T08:33:22  <pairofdice> Yeah
2012-02-21T08:33:27  <mcstar> how much did it require per week?
2012-02-21T08:33:30  <mcstar> much time*
2012-02-21T08:33:42  <pairofdice> Quite a bit
2012-02-21T08:34:14  <mcstar> did you have to research the topics, or were you handed the necessary material?
2012-02-21T08:34:21  <mcstar> s
2012-02-21T08:34:38  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2012-02-21T08:35:17  <pairofdice> Most of it I got after watching the videos a couple more times and doing them with pen and paper until I got it right
2012-02-21T08:36:03  <pairofdice> Didn't really have to research anything
2012-02-21T08:36:31  <mcstar> lets say, al you have to do, is study for these classes
2012-02-21T08:36:37  <mcstar> how many cuold you take then?
2012-02-21T08:36:45  <mcstar> at once
2012-02-21T08:37:14  <pairofdice> 4-6
2012-02-21T08:37:46  <mcstar> ok, well, than i will seriously consider taking one
2012-02-21T08:43:24  <antimatroidl> game theory looks pretty easy
2012-02-21T08:43:51  <antimatroidl> i've signed up for machine learning (because of a1k0n's mad skills) but they keep delaying
2012-02-21T08:46:34  <mcstar> im considering theory of algorithms
2012-02-21T08:47:15  <mcstar> no, its called design and analysis of algos.
2012-02-21T08:47:44  <mcstar> and there is information theory
2012-02-21T08:47:55  <mcstar> but these sound pretty introductory too
2012-02-21T08:48:36  <pairofdice> Yeah
2012-02-21T08:49:11  <mcstar> cryptography would be the most useful probably
2012-02-21T08:49:51  <pairofdice> I signed up for the graphical models and crypto
2012-02-21T08:49:57  <mcstar> i hope it would give a greater understanding than just reading than wiki
2012-02-21T08:49:58  <pairofdice> And the udacity one
2012-02-21T08:50:09  <mcstar> -than
2012-02-21T08:50:19  <mcstar> so you are going for 4?
2012-02-21T08:50:23  <mcstar> 3
2012-02-21T08:50:26  <mcstar> my damn typos
2012-02-21T08:50:42  <pairofdice> + maybe NLP
2012-02-21T08:50:58  <mcstar> neuro linguistic programming?
2012-02-21T08:51:01  <pairofdice> Natural
2012-02-21T08:51:12  <pairofdice> Language processing
2012-02-21T08:51:25  <mcstar> :)
2012-02-21T08:53:43  <mcstar> well, i can always skip class if it proves to be too time consuming, cant i?
2012-02-21T08:53:51  <pairofdice> of course

2012-02-21T10:16:57  <pairofdice> what?
2012-02-21T10:17:20  <mcstar> is he trying to joke?
2012-02-21T10:18:14  <mcstar> or maybe he doesnt want to say 'recent'
2012-02-21T10:18:28  <mcstar> or i mis-heared him
2012-02-21T10:18:49  <mcstar> you probably know the guy better, which is it?
2012-02-21T10:19:07  <pairofdice> at what point of the video?
2012-02-21T10:19:14  <pairofdice> The latter
2012-02-21T10:19:16  <mcstar> his first sentence
2012-02-21T10:19:27  <mcstar> right after the introduction
2012-02-21T10:19:41  <pairofdice> His english isn't always the best
2012-02-21T10:19:52  <mcstar> so what is he saying than?
2012-02-21T10:20:21  <mcstar> some people laugh when he says that, like it was a joke...
2012-02-21T10:21:24  <pairofdice> I don't know... Maybe a joke, Maybe a brainfart
2012-02-21T10:21:36  <pairofdice> Maybe a fartjoke
2012-02-21T10:22:12  <mcstar> XD
2012-02-21T10:24:00  <antimatroidl> perhaps he meant the introduction sucked :P
2012-02-21T10:26:15  <mcstar> if it was a joke, than i have to say, it was a great one
2012-02-21T10:26:38  <mcstar> reminds me of myself, i just dont think he is that kind of sarcastic man
2012-02-21T10:27:04  <mcstar> antimatroidl: what did you prove?
2012-02-21T10:28:44  <mcstar> prove? sorry, solve
2012-02-21T10:29:35  <antimatroidl> it was a proof actually
2012-02-21T10:31:30  <antimatroidl> i showed that if u_i(s_1, …, s_n) = u_{p(i)}(s_{p(1)}, …, s_{p(n)}) for all i, (s_1, …, s_n) and permutations p then u_i(s_1, …, s_n) = u_j(s_1, …, s_n) for all i, j and (s_1, …, s_n)
2012-02-21T10:32:27  <antimatroidl> hint, hit it with (jk) then (ijk) then (ij)
2012-02-21T10:32:50  <mcstar> whoa
2012-02-21T10:33:04  <mcstar> that guy cannot even read english text
2012-02-21T10:33:22  <mcstar> maybe he is dislexic
2012-02-21T10:33:38  <antimatroidl> you get like u_i(s_i, s_j, s_k) = u_i(s_i, s_k, s_j) = u_j(s_k, s_j, s_i) = u_j(s_i, s_j, s_k)
2012-02-21T10:33:40  <antimatroidl> i think that works
2012-02-21T10:33:50  <pairofdice> Fortunately he's in AI, not linguistics

2012-02-21T10:42:29  <mcstar> i dont understand one thing
2012-02-21T10:42:59  <mcstar> antimatroidl: this proof needs that there are the samenumber of players as strategies
2012-02-21T10:43:12  <antimatroidl> yep
2012-02-21T10:43:22  <antimatroidl> a symmetric game requires that by definition
2012-02-21T10:43:29  <mcstar> really?
2012-02-21T10:43:38  <mcstar> im shocked
2012-02-21T10:44:19  <antimatroidl> there's an incorrect definition (the if part of the above statement)

2012-02-21T10:44:50  <antimatroidl> i'm trying to show it's somewhat surprisingly a stricter notion of von neumanns definition of symmetric games
2012-02-21T10:46:37  <antimatroidl> which is if u_i(s_1, …, s_n) = u_{p(i)}(s_{p(1)}, …, s_{p(n)}) for all i, p and (s_1, …, s_n) then u_{p(i)}(s_1, …, s_n) = u_i(s_{p(1)}, …, s_{p(n)}) for all i, p and (s_1, .., s_n)
2012-02-21T10:46:48  <antimatroidl> i think the above pretty much gives it, but i haven't worked all the way through yet
2012-02-21T10:47:42  <antimatroidl> my thesis incorrectly tries to point that out

2012-02-21T10:48:35  <mcstar> dont tell that to the committe
