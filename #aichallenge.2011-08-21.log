2011-08-21T15:50:57  <janzert> mleise: seems like the latest visualizer updates have messed up the player rank numbering?
2011-08-21T15:51:56  <mleise> I haven't recompiled it yet, someone didn't like firefox on the server and uninstalled the java plugin files, which are required to build the applet
2011-08-21T15:52:18  <janzert> ok, weird
2011-08-21T15:52:36  <mleise> what do you mean exactly?
2011-08-21T15:52:49  <mleise> So far I did a 'git pull'
2011-08-21T15:52:50  <janzert> I'll get a screenshot here in just a second
2011-08-21T15:53:19  <janzert> I'm wondering now if it's a FF7 bug since I run the firefox beta and it just recently switched over to 7
2011-08-21T15:54:15  <mleise> That's easy to check :)
2011-08-21T15:57:41  <janzert> http://imgur.com/EIzak messed up FF7
2011-08-21T15:57:49  <janzert> and it does look fine in chrome
2011-08-21T15:58:06  <amstan> mleise: sorry, i didn't realize the firefox was required, i tought someone was doing x forwarding with it or something
2011-08-21T15:58:34  <janzert> looks like FF7 is somehow reseting the position of the checkmark and ) to the beginning of the name
2011-08-21T15:58:48  <mleise> no, it is just a very long dependency chain pulling in all kinds of Gnome libs, Firefox, xorg, ...
2011-08-21T15:59:08  <mleise> janzert: it does what?
2011-08-21T15:59:35  <janzert> did you see the screenshot above?
2011-08-21T15:59:41  <mleise> oh lol, they just fixed their last regression in the visualizer with version 6 -.-
2011-08-21T15:59:48  <janzert> right :(
2011-08-21T16:00:07  <janzert> we should get them to add the visualizer as a regression test ;)
2011-08-21T16:00:36  <mleise> I think so. I have some pretty evil corner cases in it
2011-08-21T16:00:47  <janzert> not even sure how to try and search for this in bugzilla :/
2011-08-21T16:01:11  <janzert> I assume the checkmark is a unicode character?
2011-08-21T16:01:49  <mleise> Yes, it is a special symbol. Some special handling is necessary for asian symbols or right-to-left languages
2011-08-21T16:02:36  <mleise> That said you *can* mess the code for that up, but it was working fine, so what did they have to change there?
2011-08-21T16:03:25  <mleise> I better wait and see what I introduced in terms of regressions with the new way of rendering

2011-08-21T16:53:53  <mcstar> ehhhh
2011-08-21T16:54:00  <mcstar> i dont understand this
2011-08-21T16:54:41  <mcstar> if i initialize an integer with a hex number, shouldnt i get back the same hex representation when i try to print it with printf(in hex mode)
2011-08-21T16:54:43  <mleise> oh it looks probably like I had some old file in my cache
2011-08-21T16:54:46  <mcstar> ?
2011-08-21T16:56:15  <mcstar> mleise: cant you help me,
2011-08-21T16:56:17  <mcstar> ?
2011-08-21T16:56:28  <mleise> mcstar: it could switch lower-case and upper-case or decide to always print the full length of possible digits. and i think it omits the leading 0x that you would use in C
2011-08-21T16:57:12  <mcstar> ah im just plain stupid
2011-08-21T16:57:28  <mcstar> i used the number 0x01020304
2011-08-21T16:57:37  <mcstar> but printf of course deletes the leading 0
2011-08-21T16:57:42  <mcstar> 1020304
2011-08-21T16:58:33  <mcstar> im having a hard time converting between int4 and double2 on the gpu
2011-08-21T16:59:15  <mcstar> the plain c re-casting magic doesnt seem to work on the gpu, im not quite sure why, though its ok on the cpu
2011-08-21T17:00:55  <mleise> it would have to be defined in C to always work
2011-08-21T17:01:22  <mleise> C doesn't define even an inline assembler language
2011-08-21T17:11:16  <mleise> The closure compiler seems to assign to names to the same property of an object. I'll take a look at that tomorrow
