2011-06-23T07:06:23  <stocha> The early game termination shoudn't give bonus points.
2011-06-23T07:06:49  <stocha> especially not to the less than 10% cumulative ant count  players.
2011-06-23T07:07:19  <stocha> because if some other had a good fight, and were eliminated, they would then loose. this behavior favors hiding and blocking.
2011-06-23T07:07:42  <stocha> here is sample game showing the bad final ranking : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=34074&user=226
2011-06-23T07:08:17  <antimatroid> stocha: i somewhat agree
2011-06-23T07:08:22  <antimatroid> i'll have a chat with mcleopold about it later
2011-06-23T07:08:25  <stocha> maybe you *could* give the remaining player a percentage of food corresponding to their percent of ants.
2011-06-23T07:08:51  <antimatroid> stocha: the idea of not giving the dominant player their "share" of the bonus is to encourage them to end the game before the cut off
2011-06-23T07:09:03  <antimatroid> but simply not giving the bonus to anyone would also achieve this
2011-06-23T07:09:08  <stocha> antimatroid: okay. The early termination is probably a good idea though. And in any case, as long as rule are known, there is no severe issues there (people will just make more shy bots then)
2011-06-23T07:09:21  <antimatroid> yep pretty much :)
2011-06-23T07:09:22  <stocha> antimatroid: yeah no giving the bonus is probably best in fact
2011-06-23T07:09:31  <stocha> because the leading bot HAD to beat the lossing bots.
2011-06-23T07:09:38  <antimatroid> i tend to agree right now, but there's always more things than i think of at one time
2011-06-23T07:09:46  <stocha> (of course if there is perfect blocking, then it's a bit harsher, but still)
2011-06-23T07:10:10  <antimatroid> i'm pretty keen to get rid of perfect blocking if possible for that reason
2011-06-23T07:10:27  <stocha> antimatroid: what i find most probably not satisfying is to have the lossing shy bots receives such a huge bonus for doing nothing.
2011-06-23T07:10:54  <antimatroid> the food bonus isn't given at max turns is it?
2011-06-23T07:11:06  <stocha> so i'm happy with percent of total bonus given according to controled territory share, or ant share (if easier and cleaner)
2011-06-23T07:11:09  <antimatroid> i think even with that it makes more sense just to not give it if we can the game early
2011-06-23T07:11:17  <antimatroid> we wont do that
2011-06-23T07:11:37  <antimatroid> it doesn't give any real incentive for the leading bot to end the game, just continue growing or whatever
2011-06-23T07:11:53  <stocha> anyway start by talking to McLeopold about the problem. we shall see how it goes.
2011-06-23T07:12:26  <stocha> i don't anticipate that i will be opposed to a solution :)
2011-06-23T07:12:53  <stocha> he
2011-06-23T07:13:05  <stocha> not i. why do i keep typing i, when i want to we. mystery.
2011-06-23T07:13:26  <stocha> when i want to type HE. oh man.

2011-06-23T08:03:03  <stocha> Zaphus: but i didn't have much work to do to make the snake alive, because i had parts of bot librairies all around the place. So i found most of what i needed (and what i didn't found anything for, i didn't do : p )
2011-06-23T08:03:35  <stocha> Zaphus: my testing showed that the snake can break and do hawfull things. But in server's game mostly you don't see those.
2011-06-23T08:04:10  <stocha> Zaphus: i uploaded the snake try to bit it's tail if it feels head menaced versions; We'll see if it looks as crapy as it does in my testings :p
2011-06-23T08:05:26  <stocha> Zaphus: one sad thing about this contest, is that the official game is all about who can make it to the top. But i'm pretty sure there is much to expect from the ant game than just that. People having only account will make original works hard though.

2011-06-23T08:19:40  <george1914> note.  my playgame.py  was taken from git quite a few days ago

2011-06-23T08:24:16  <george1914> i guess mcstar and aerique would advise i switch to language with REPL  :)
2011-06-23T08:24:32  <george1914> antimatroid:  ah, i was only using 'player seed'
2011-06-23T08:24:34  <antimatroid> if there exists an enemy ant within the battle radius of yours with less than or equal to the same number of enemies in range, your ant dies

2011-06-23T08:27:58  <antimatroid> it is then i think
2011-06-23T08:28:07  <stocha> antimatroid: i really think you guys should use ONE term in the story. Not mix up many of them.
2011-06-23T08:28:18  <antimatroid> i didn't write that
2011-06-23T08:28:19  <stocha> so goes with focus, and stick to it. or with distracted and stick with that.
2011-06-23T08:28:32  <stocha> antimatroid: it seems like nobody proofed read it.
2011-06-23T08:28:41  <stocha> yet it was commited.
2011-06-23T08:29:19  <stocha> I'm afraid it will be VERY confusing in it's current state. Which was probably not the goal.
2011-06-23T08:29:30  <antimatroid> actually, you're right, it's really wrong, how about...
2011-06-23T08:30:06  <stocha> an ant dies if it is equally or more distracted that any of it's opponents.
2011-06-23T08:30:16  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-23T08:30:26  <antimatroid> so each enemy ant must be more occupied
2011-06-23T08:30:39  <stocha> ....

2011-06-23T08:31:46  <stocha> occupy = to dwell or reside in.
2011-06-23T08:31:55  <stocha> how is that related to distraction ? :p
2011-06-23T08:32:07  <antimatroid> occupied := number of enemy ants occupying your battle efforts
2011-06-23T08:32:09  <stocha> antimatroid: are you english native speaker ?
2011-06-23T08:32:14  <antimatroid> i am
2011-06-23T08:32:29  <stocha> i'm not.
2011-06-23T08:32:36  <stocha> so i used google to find meaning :p
2011-06-23T08:32:54  <antimatroid> is that logically correct now though?
2011-06-23T08:33:45  <stocha> i don't think so.
2011-06-23T08:34:08  <stocha> an ant is as distracted as the number of ennemy in range i believe.
2011-06-23T08:34:22  <stocha> ah distracted=occupied

2011-06-23T08:34:28  <antimatroid> "So you can see for an ant to survive, each enemy ant must be more occupied. If any opponent is equally or less occupied your ant will die." that might be clearer
2011-06-23T08:34:40  <stocha> so an ant is as occupied as the number of ennemy in range then
2011-06-23T08:34:45  <antimatroid> yep

2011-06-23T08:34:58  <antimatroid> and if you're less occupied than all of your enemies in range, you survive
2011-06-23T08:35:09  <stocha> so it's probably logically correct. But a bit beyond my ability to understand :)
2011-06-23T08:35:20  <antimatroid> do you understand the rule in general?
2011-06-23T08:35:34  <stocha> occupy just don't hit anything in me :)
2011-06-23T08:35:34  <antimatroid> it's really funny, it's hard to understand, but once you do i think it's quite simple
2011-06-23T08:35:58  <antimatroid> your time can be occupied by something
2011-06-23T08:36:02  <antimatroid> it's a fairly common english word
2011-06-23T08:36:04  <stocha> i think i understand it with both "ennemy in range" and "distracted"
2011-06-23T08:36:13  <stocha> but i certainly have trouble with occupied.
2011-06-23T08:36:28  <antimatroid> i think of it as |enemies(a)| < |enemies(b)| forall b \in enemies(a)
2011-06-23T08:36:34  <stocha> which seems understandable when i look at google for occupied.
2011-06-23T08:37:04  *** gobang <gobang!~gobang@89.204.153.138> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-23T08:37:06  <stocha> occupied is more often used in the millitary meaning
2011-06-23T08:37:19  <stocha> for link on google being how germany occupied france.
2011-06-23T08:37:41  <stocha> first link on google
2011-06-23T08:37:58  <antimatroid> google is different for each person
2011-06-23T08:38:14  <antimatroid> it's even different for the same person on the same account on a different computer/location
2011-06-23T08:38:27  <stocha> distracted though refers to "mentally confused" which i feel goes well with dying. for some reason :)
2011-06-23T08:38:51  <stocha> antimatroid: you are sort of wrong. because the main stream stay coherent.
2011-06-23T08:39:03  <stocha> i use it for example, for checking spellings.
2011-06-23T08:39:09  <stocha> it works well for that;
2011-06-23T08:39:32  <stocha> albeit results may vary a bit. i always can distinguish good spelling from bad speelings.
2011-06-23T08:39:41  <antimatroid> speelings
2011-06-23T08:39:43  <stocha> (in french)
2011-06-23T08:40:10  <antimatroid> en de twa cut sanc sis :P
2011-06-23T08:40:14  <antimatroid> can i spell well?
2011-06-23T08:40:34  <dr-> it could be for a french one :D
2011-06-23T08:40:35  <stocha> "bad spelling" = 2,800,000 hit on google
2011-06-23T08:40:52  <stocha> "bad spellings"= 24,700 hits on google
2011-06-23T08:41:07  <stocha> so "bad spelling" is more frenquent than "bad spellings"
2011-06-23T08:41:31  <stocha> those actual numbers may vary everyone will get it consistent with the conclusion.
2011-06-23T08:41:36  <mcstar> try bad spells
2011-06-23T08:41:37  <dr-> where do you learn french numbers antimatroid ?
2011-06-23T08:41:49  <antimatroid> dr-: primary school, a long time ago :P
2011-06-23T08:41:57  <antimatroid> i can count up to 39 very poorly maybe?
2011-06-23T08:42:08  <dr-> yep, i can see that
2011-06-23T08:42:10  <stocha> antimatroid: it can be understood. if being imaginativ. But the spelling is not 100%
2011-06-23T08:42:30  <stocha> un deux trois quatre cinq six
2011-06-23T08:42:36  <antimatroid> i know that, bon jeur, au revoir and pleteau (not sure how to spell that, meant to be somewhat like "fuck"?)
2011-06-23T08:43:01  <stocha> bonjour. aurevoir ... what ?
2011-06-23T08:43:09  <dr-> still, french ppl learning english at college have a very bad english :/
2011-06-23T08:43:21  <stocha> pleteau ? this one must have been twisted hard ...
2011-06-23T08:43:26  <antimatroid> yeah i have no foreign language skills
2011-06-23T08:43:33  <antimatroid> stocha: would not surprise me
2011-06-23T08:43:33  <dr-> yeah, i don't understand this one too
2011-06-23T08:43:56  <antimatroid> the pronounciation i have heard reminds me of the cartoon dog
2011-06-23T08:43:57  <stocha> dr : i think it was putain. some 1000 years ago. and evolved to plateau :p
2011-06-23T08:44:25  <dr-> what an evolution
2011-06-23T08:44:56  <antimatroid> one would hope it plateaued there :P
2011-06-23T08:45:08  <stocha> dr i may be wrong also. maybe it's an exotic bad word, that french people tend to forget. Like "diantre" maybe. badly pronounced.
2011-06-23T08:45:41  <antimatroid> i think i mean pluta? more, i would expect putain to be right if that's an "offensive" word?

2011-06-23T08:47:11  <stocha> mcstar:  probably. when it first came out.  And this is not a film i remember particularly well ...
2011-06-23T08:47:14  <dr-> I'm french stocha, and i was also looking for a word near "plateau"
2011-06-23T08:47:21  <stocha> although i do kindof remember the dinner
2011-06-23T08:47:50  <stocha> dr : i had bet that you were french dr. or native french speaker at least.
2011-06-23T08:47:53  <mcstar> he says something pretty long, and it supposed to be full of cursing
2011-06-23T08:48:22  <mcstar> antimatroid: sry, but you always ask those questions(i like all 3 of them)
2011-06-23T08:48:23  <stocha> mcstar:  can you find the scene on youtube or something ?
2011-06-23T08:48:31  <mcstar> maybe

2011-06-23T08:49:18  <stocha> antimatroid: if someone do like the film, it can be taken personnaly. understably.
2011-06-23T08:49:55  <stocha> dr: because of your reacting at antimatroid counted. And vague impression that you somehow were flaged french in the past.
2011-06-23T08:49:55  <antimatroid> hmmm fair call, people should care less about what other people think though :P
2011-06-23T08:50:20  <stocha> antimatroid: i find your hatred funny though :p
2011-06-23T08:50:34  <antimatroid> i'm an equal opportunist hater
2011-06-23T08:50:45  <stocha> antimatroid: what do you think if highlander 2 ? I'm yet to find someone that is offensed by another dislike of it.
2011-06-23T08:50:59  <antimatroid> haven't heard of it? :P
2011-06-23T08:51:00  <stocha> so i always talk high of it.
2011-06-23T08:51:10  <stocha> antimatroid: you know highlander ?
2011-06-23T08:51:14  <stocha> the film.
2011-06-23T08:51:17  <antimatroid> nope
2011-06-23T08:51:34  <stocha> antimatroid: that would explain your not knowing the second opus then.
2011-06-23T08:52:18  <stocha> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)

2011-06-23T08:52:32  <stocha> the first opus is a classic.
2011-06-23T08:52:53  <stocha> the second one ... well it's certainly the WORST second oppus in second opus history.
2011-06-23T08:53:06  <antimatroid> stocha: i wasn't even born when that came out :P
2011-06-23T08:53:16  <antimatroid> troll 2 is the best bad film ever
2011-06-23T08:53:29  <stocha> antimatroid: does that means you can't watch it ?
2011-06-23T08:53:36  <antimatroid> that means i love it
2011-06-23T08:53:42  <antimatroid> oh or highlander?
2011-06-23T08:54:05  <antimatroid> doesn't mean i can't, but i don't really get down to old movies
2011-06-23T08:55:00  <stocha> mcstar: loooll :)

2011-06-23T09:37:48  <stocha> mcstar: i'm a standard case of lucid dreamer :)
2011-06-23T09:37:56  <mcstar> i read about this, but i cant really control my dreams
2011-06-23T09:38:07  <mcstar> i cant punch or run in my dreams
2011-06-23T09:38:10  <stocha> mcstar: it's not about controling.
2011-06-23T09:38:21  <stocha> mcstar:  although i sometime did just that.
2011-06-23T09:38:32  <stocha> mcstar: it's more about them being lucid.

2011-06-23T09:38:46  <mcstar> let me rephrase: i dont recognise that im dreaming

2011-06-23T09:39:30  <stocha> mcstar: The only case i really "controlled" them hard,  was when i was about to dye in them. The big fall case being recurent. So i would just twist the dream, in order not to wake up :)
2011-06-23T09:40:13  <mcstar> i dreamt once that im falling off the roof of a long house, i fell off repeatedly like in a computer game
2011-06-23T09:40:46  <stocha> mcstar: i think i did recognize them because of silly contingency. When i was three (or six ?), i dreamed i was in the toilet .. and when i woke up, i realized it was a dream. So i develop this habit of being very carefull i was not in a dream was going to the toilet :p

2011-06-23T09:41:41  <stocha> mcstar: from the techniques i read for having lucid dreams, that's probably one important part of the affair
2011-06-23T09:42:13  <stocha> the other one being that since the age of three, my father told me that dreams were mine, and that i could do whatever i want in them.
2011-06-23T09:42:16  <mcstar> have you seen Waking Life?
2011-06-23T09:42:24  <stocha> mcstar: no
2011-06-23T09:42:59  <mcstar> i suggest you do, its a cartoonish movie(from the director-or-whatever of the man who did A Scanner Darkly)
2011-06-23T09:43:18  <mcstar> it deals with this sort of stuff, quite good actually, even if your are not a lucid dreamer
2011-06-23T09:44:35  <mcstar> i dont remember that my parent ever talked to me about dreams
2011-06-23T09:44:38  <mcstar> s
2011-06-23T09:45:03  <stocha> mcstar, once i happened to be dreaming of me being pursued. Of course i was able to fly (i had trouble outrunning well at this time), but i was annoyed. So i wanted to commit suicide to escape the dream
2011-06-23T09:45:12  <mcstar> and i dont really have nightmares, and when i do, i usually enjoy them
2011-06-23T09:45:22  <mcstar> fighting with aliens/robots being my favourite
2011-06-23T09:45:25  <stocha> then i had this terrible doubt : am i 100% sure that this a dream (okay i can fly in there, but you never know ...)
2011-06-23T09:45:46  <stocha> so i decided to just push hard on a wall, very hard (the roof wall in fact)
2011-06-23T09:45:55  <stocha> and then it worked. I woke up.
2011-06-23T09:46:07  <mcstar> hm
2011-06-23T09:46:15  *** gobang <gobang!~gobang@89.204.153.138> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-06-23T09:46:17  <stocha> then i hear someone bang at the door. I oppen, and it was the pursuer !
2011-06-23T09:46:29  <mcstar> well, my argument is: you can do whatever in a dream, never worry.
2011-06-23T09:46:37  <stocha> only i couldn't fly any more for some reason. That's really troubling when this happens :)
2011-06-23T09:46:40  <mcstar> if you are AWAKE you would always know
2011-06-23T09:46:44  <stocha> After a while i woke up naturally.
2011-06-23T09:47:02  <stocha> mcstar: it's not always that clear.
2011-06-23T09:47:24  <mcstar> well, just think it through
2011-06-23T09:47:26  <stocha> mcstar: with time passing lucid dreams transformed into something else.
2011-06-23T09:47:36  <mcstar> dont apply any sort of safeguards
2011-06-23T09:47:46  <stocha> mcstar: you don't have your full awaked thinking habits.
2011-06-23T09:47:50  <stocha> it's more like you retain some.
2011-06-23T09:48:15  <stocha> while most probably big parts of your brain have other duty to fulfil
2011-06-23T09:48:29  <mcstar> ok, so what i mean, is that i dont second guess myself when i dream(at least that is what i remember)
2011-06-23T09:49:04  <stocha> A few month ago (i think) i had this dream, and there was magnificent view. I said to myself, wow. That's a dream. I should really try to memorize that viewing.
2011-06-23T09:49:21  <mcstar> :)
2011-06-23T09:49:41  <stocha> but then the dream went on, and the fact that it was a dream was less and less important to me. I was all in the story. Which was quite complex at the end.
2011-06-23T09:49:56  <stocha> Mostly i don't remember my dream though.
2011-06-23T09:50:46  <mcstar> what i try sometimes before i try to fall asleep, is to visualize something in details, for example my room, or anything material
2011-06-23T09:50:56  <stocha> I think a few years back, i managed to run really really fast in a dream. It felt very good. I don't think there was someone pursuing me this time. But when i woke up, it was like : now they will never catch me back again :)
2011-06-23T09:51:00  <mcstar> sometimes for a second its like i see all the details
2011-06-23T09:51:16  <mcstar> as if i was holding that thing in my hands
2011-06-23T09:51:26  <stocha> mcstar: when i was younger, i wanted to decide the content of my dreams before hand. That never worked for me.
2011-06-23T09:51:54  <mcstar> maybe you should just train harder, i dont know
2011-06-23T09:51:59  <stocha> mcstar:  the human brain and imagination seems to be a vast place indeed though. Dream being an important aspect of it.
2011-06-23T09:52:21  <stocha> mcstar: with years passing, i got totally disinterested with that. I have the luck of never having nightmares.
2011-06-23T09:52:32  <mcstar> what i dont want is to get lost in dreaming, it can interfere with your real life i think
2011-06-23T09:52:40  <stocha> good dreams for me, are simply good stories. Or even feeling good when i wake up.
2011-06-23T09:53:13  <stocha> I don't need remembering them in most cases. (except if something really important happens. Like running fast at last, or something very impressive)

2011-06-23T09:54:04  <mcstar> i think its very important to remember them, cause its pointless to have them if you have no memory of them
2011-06-23T09:54:12  <stocha> mcstar: i don't think you could let dream interfere with your own life voluntarily. but who knows.
2011-06-23T09:54:34  <stocha> mcstar: i found out this was not true for me.

2011-06-23T09:54:55  <stocha> totally accepting not to remember them, be they lucid or not, offers lots of freedom.
2011-06-23T09:55:25  <mcstar> i have some problem with concentration/tiredness, so i definitely dont want to start this sort of dreaming now, i want to be in bed as little as possible
2011-06-23T09:55:27  <stocha> although it's probably good to remember a bit, or the whole thing from time to time. (like once in year)
2011-06-23T09:56:24  <stocha> mcstar: dreaming (when asleep) is a very active period of like. The most active in fact. (brainwise)
2011-06-23T09:56:32  <stocha> life
2011-06-23T09:56:43  <mcstar> rem sleep is, yes
2011-06-23T09:56:43  <stocha> So one has to respect that.
2011-06-23T09:57:23  <stocha> People tend to want control over there dreams. But control is not good. You have to let thing go. Be you lucid or not.
2011-06-23T09:57:50  <stocha> Although a litle bit of contral *can* be fun. Like trying to go through wall (or glass). I never did that very well.
2011-06-23T09:57:52  <mcstar> my only wish right now is that i wake up refreshed
2011-06-23T09:58:10  <stocha> Then ask for that that before sleeping.
2011-06-23T09:58:12  <mcstar> unfortunately its rarely the case
2011-06-23T09:58:27  <stocha> hey you, do whatever you want, i'll appreciate if i wake up refreshed :)
2011-06-23T09:58:55  <mcstar> stocha: im not sort of guy who tricks himself with self-pep-talk
2011-06-23T09:59:02  <stocha> I also never use beeper to wake up. I just ask : it would be good if i woke at 8:00 tomorow.
2011-06-23T09:59:27  <stocha> mcstar: it's a way to be clear with yourselve. But their might be other ways.
2011-06-23T09:59:31  <mcstar> thats ok, i can wake up on time, but ill get sleepy soon
2011-06-23T09:59:39  <stocha> mcstar:  i use it when i want to wake up at a precise time.
2011-06-23T10:00:06  <stocha> mcstar: is it easy to fall asleep for you ?
2011-06-23T10:00:30  <mcstar> very easy usually(when im not on coffeine, but sometimes even then)
2011-06-23T10:00:49  <stocha> How much time do sleep then ?
2011-06-23T10:01:02  <mcstar> depends, 6-7-8
2011-06-23T10:01:38  <stocha> maybe you should juste give you a bit more time then.
2011-06-23T10:01:52  <stocha> or have a nap.
2011-06-23T10:01:56  <mcstar> no, it doesnt help, tried it
2011-06-23T10:02:20  <stocha> I'll say : do some yoga. might help :)
2011-06-23T10:02:39  <stocha> i never tried it myself though.
2011-06-23T10:02:54  <stocha> but from what i have read, it seems to be efficient.
2011-06-23T10:03:03  <mcstar> i dont want to do yoga, maybe tai-chi
2011-06-23T10:03:13  <stocha> ah i did a bit of tai-chi
2011-06-23T10:03:20  <stocha> i think it's quite good.
2011-06-23T10:03:40  <mcstar> but what is good, is running i liked that one, unfortunately my left leg is not in very good shape
2011-06-23T10:03:50  <stocha> but i think i'll do a bit of aikido first. in a few years i might try tai-shi again.
2011-06-23T10:04:14  <stocha> running is very hard on bones and muscles it seems.
2011-06-23T10:04:26  <mcstar> but its the best thing, really
2011-06-23T10:04:33  <mcstar> mentally and physically
2011-06-23T10:04:47  <stocha> stoSnake is 60th
2011-06-23T10:05:01  <mcstar> right, lets program
2011-06-23T10:05:14  <stocha> mcstar: i think taishi (and also aikido) are good for people that spend long time on a chair (or worst)
2011-06-23T10:06:06  <mcstar> sure
2011-06-23T10:06:16  <mcstar> its good for everyone

2011-06-23T14:25:34  <McLeopold> janzert: If I can determine that 100% of the users have resubmitted since a bots last game, then I want to increase sigma to the starting value
2011-06-23T14:25:57  <McLeopold> but, what if there mu is at 25?  their skill would then be -25
2011-06-23T14:26:04  <McLeopold> 25 - 3 * 16.667
2011-06-23T14:26:55  <McLeopold> I could make sure that low and high stay within 0 to 100, but then bot ranked high and low won't ever get as much sigma increase
2011-06-23T14:29:43  <gobang>  what's the current value for initial mu ?
2011-06-23T14:30:30  <McLeopold> 50
2011-06-23T14:30:37  <janzert> the display seems to already be limited to 0 anyway
2011-06-23T14:30:46  <McLeopold> true...
2011-06-23T14:30:54  <janzert> at least I'm pretty sure I saw one a few days ago that should have been -2 or so
2011-06-23T14:31:00  <McLeopold> but on the top end, it might go above 100
2011-06-23T14:31:19  <janzert> not from increasing sigma
2011-06-23T14:31:20  <McLeopold> I remember putting in a min function so people wouldn't get depressed :)
2011-06-23T14:31:46  <janzert> anyway I don't think it's a problem increasing the sigma the same at the limits
2011-06-23T14:32:08  <McLeopold> I feel it might be an issue of the bell curve doesn't stay in the 0-100 range
2011-06-23T14:32:38  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-06-23T14:32:45  <janzert> in which case I feel it's already too spread out for the number of players we have
2011-06-23T14:33:03  <McLeopold> you mean, go ahead and limit the increase to stay within the bounds?
2011-06-23T14:33:10  <janzert> no
2011-06-23T14:33:31  <janzert> I mean the current mu spread is probably to large
2011-06-23T14:33:44  <McLeopold> what's our ranges?
2011-06-23T14:34:11  <janzert> 98.81 to -7.06
2011-06-23T14:34:56  <McLeopold> wow, how did he go negative?
2011-06-23T14:35:34  <janzert> that's the mu not skill
2011-06-23T14:35:45  <McLeopold> I know
2011-06-23T14:36:01  <McLeopold> still, I thought trueskill kept it in bounds
2011-06-23T14:36:31  <janzert> there isn't any theoretical limit, just the farther out it is the less likely it is

2011-06-23T14:40:39  <McLeopold> make sure to update

2011-06-23T14:53:45  <janzert> first rough guess is between 1/2 and 1/3 ?
2011-06-23T14:54:02  <McLeopold> what is "it"
2011-06-23T14:54:10  <janzert> i.e. the new game rate will be between 1/2 and 1/3 of the current rate
2011-06-23T14:54:17  <McLeopold> due to what change?
2011-06-23T14:54:25  <janzert> setting serial=2
2011-06-23T14:54:28  <McLeopold> oh
2011-06-23T14:54:51  <McLeopold> you could base it on average players per game

2011-06-23T14:55:24  <janzert> yes, I with an average of 6 players per game it would be 1/3 if all the players were active for the full game
2011-06-23T14:55:43  <janzert> but since players will drop out throughout the course of the game it should be higher

2011-06-23T15:06:01  <McLeopold> stocha: the amount of food a bot will see on the first turn
2011-06-23T15:06:09  <McLeopold> the range right now is 1 - 3
2011-06-23T15:06:23  <McLeopold> later we will increase it to 2 - 4
2011-06-23T15:06:39  <antimatroid> how does increasing the view radius make the game more challanging?
2011-06-23T15:06:42  <antimatroid> more information?
2011-06-23T15:07:04  <McLeopold> It means good path finders have more of an advantage
2011-06-23T15:07:23  <antimatroid> ... because they're struggling to beat non-path finding bots? :P

2011-06-23T15:07:48  <McLeopold> once everyone does pathfinding, we want to be able to separate good from bad
2011-06-23T15:07:59  <antimatroid> stocha: the number of food squares visible to your ant on the first turn
2011-06-23T15:08:06  <stocha> McLeopold: i though a food is visible if in view radius
2011-06-23T15:08:07  <McLeopold> stocha: you get 1 ant to start with, and you can see only a small part of the map
2011-06-23T15:08:30  <stocha> McLeopold: yeah. So you can see food if the ant can see it.
2011-06-23T15:08:41  <McLeopold> the game places starting food at the beginning, some of that food will be place in the ants vision at the start
2011-06-23T15:08:50  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what's happening with the spawn rate?
2011-06-23T15:09:02  <antimatroid> i still think there's too many ants and the maps are flooding
2011-06-23T15:09:05  <McLeopold> staying the same, I think it is good
2011-06-23T15:09:06  <antimatroid> but that could just be crap bots
2011-06-23T15:09:45  <stocha> McLeopold: so that is the number of food in the first ant vision radius ?
2011-06-23T15:09:45  <antimatroid> i'd prefer more strategic battles than just a flood of ants going at it :P
2011-06-23T15:09:55  <McLeopold> if the spawn rate is too slow at the start, it seems to make the game have more luck
2011-06-23T15:10:02  <_flag> If there's too little food there's little incentive to do battles over simply running away and hoping other bots kill each other
2011-06-23T15:10:08  <McLeopold> stocha: yes
2011-06-23T15:10:14  <stocha> McLeopold: why is this thing needed ?

2011-06-23T15:10:51  <McLeopold> stocha: so that bots have a good start, it's to reduce the luck factor of chosing the wrong first direction to explore
2011-06-23T15:10:53  <stocha> antimatroid: isn't that what's diversity is for ?
2011-06-23T15:11:12  <stocha> McLeopold: okay.
2011-06-23T15:11:26  <stocha> McLeopold: it's all about map generation.
2011-06-23T15:11:50  <McLeopold> antimatroid: janzert was arguing for more food than I was.  I wouldn't mind dropping the rate more
2011-06-23T15:12:05  <stocha> Arguably with 3 ants, good bot will do better than bad bots. Where with only one, they might do the same.
2011-06-23T15:12:31  <stocha> McLeopold: isn't the rate random per game ?
2011-06-23T15:12:38  <janzert> I think most ants will not end the game until reaching current densities anyway so lowering the food rate simply increases the game length
2011-06-23T15:12:49  <janzert> s/ants/bots
2011-06-23T15:13:03  <McLeopold> it would, but the battles would be more interesting
2011-06-23T15:13:15  <stocha> i think the food rate should be random (let's say uniformly sprayed). So only the bounds are oppen to discussions.
2011-06-23T15:13:27  <janzert> stocha: it is
2011-06-23T15:13:43  <stocha> are we discussion the bounds then ?
2011-06-23T15:13:47  <stocha> we could use bell curves also.
2011-06-23T15:13:54  <McLeopold> lower bound is 8/12 per turn per player, upper is 2/30 per turn per player
2011-06-23T15:14:10  <janzert> I do think change the bounds to be based on either the total number of players or the size of the map would be a really good thing
2011-06-23T15:14:11  <McLeopold> it is curved, but not a bell
2011-06-23T15:14:30  <McLeopold> janzert: it is based on number of players already
2011-06-23T15:14:34  <stocha> McLeopold:  so lower bound is higher than upper one ?
2011-06-23T15:14:37  <janzert> ahh, great
2011-06-23T15:14:58  <McLeopold> whoops :)
2011-06-23T15:15:11  <stocha> okay so the bounds are correct then.
2011-06-23T15:15:26  *** okay is now known as okayzed
2011-06-23T15:15:32  <stocha> Seems quite a wide range then.
2011-06-23T15:17:09  <stocha> yeah adding map size into the equation might be worthy.
2011-06-23T15:17:10  *** gobang <gobang!~gobang@89.204.153.138> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-23T15:17:37  <stocha> my first idea was to have a probability based on empty square to spawn food. So the bigger the map, the more the food.
2011-06-23T15:17:47  <McLeopold> the starting food is based on land area
2011-06-23T15:17:50  <stocha> it makes sense really.
2011-06-23T15:18:03  <janzert> stocha: per player base should be fine
2011-06-23T15:18:06  <stocha> so should the new spawned one i think.
2011-06-23T15:18:32  <stocha> you should use perplayer And per number of ground square on map. IMHO
2011-06-23T15:19:02  <stocha> Although the per player part, i'm not that sure in fact.
2011-06-23T15:19:14  <stocha> what's the justification behind per player ?
2011-06-23T15:19:21  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what are your thoughts on the numbers of ants btw?
2011-06-23T15:19:26  <janzert> well, it can't really be both since they don't correspond 1 to 1 although either will roughly correspond to the other
2011-06-23T15:19:31  <McLeopold> number of bots?
2011-06-23T15:19:32  <antimatroid> i think 10 is too many for one game without too much randomness
2011-06-23T15:19:36  <antimatroid> in a game
2011-06-23T15:19:49  <McLeopold> 2-26
2011-06-23T15:20:08  <antimatroid> those are our bounds
2011-06-23T15:20:26  <antimatroid> what are your thoughts on more reasonable parameters? or do you actually want games with 26 bots? :P
2011-06-23T15:20:35  <McLeopold> antimatroid: do the 10 player games cause large mu and sigma updates?
2011-06-23T15:20:41  <stocha> it all depends on map size really.
2011-06-23T15:20:45  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@nat/google/x-ywfjysmiofvihqag> has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
2011-06-23T15:20:50  <antimatroid> the scoring should make more sense in a 2 player setting with spawn points i think
2011-06-23T15:21:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I don't know much about trueskill
2011-06-23T15:21:10  <stocha> i think that the number of player simply make the game different.
2011-06-23T15:21:29  <stocha> especially because then strength also depends on opponents features.
2011-06-23T15:21:39  <stocha> while in 1vs1 it's less dependent on players features.
2011-06-23T15:21:39  <janzert> stocha: by basing food rate on per player you can reason about how fast a player should be able to grow their population
2011-06-23T15:22:02  <stocha> but, with the close game only, i think you'd get a consistent ranking, whatever the number of player
2011-06-23T15:22:28  <janzert> antimatroid: the 10 player games I see FlagCapper in he still comes in first
2011-06-23T15:22:30  <stocha> janzert: but you can steal other player's food.
2011-06-23T15:22:39  <janzert> stocha: yes, and good for you
2011-06-23T15:22:40  <stocha> janzert: so i don't get it.
2011-06-23T15:22:55  <antimatroid> janzert: flag and sir_macelon don't have much competition atm
2011-06-23T15:23:03  <antimatroid> i can't believe my bot is ranked so highly
2011-06-23T15:23:09  <stocha> janzert: why not have a food speed based on map size then ? (and then you can it so that each player zone receive a fair amount)
2011-06-23T15:23:42  <antimatroid> i tend to agree with stocha
2011-06-23T15:23:45  <stocha> i still thing that there should be at least 10% of games be 1vs1
2011-06-23T15:23:48  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@nat/google/x-thmqzvelzdjlnpjw> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-23T15:24:01  <antimatroid> for per player amount to be similar, players bases need to be about the same relative size
2011-06-23T15:24:02  <stocha> 1vs1 games are really fun to watch.
2011-06-23T15:24:18  <stocha> when 4 free for all, can look like a mess.
2011-06-23T15:24:25  <antimatroid> making that not implicit would allow more reasonable variation of players base sizes
2011-06-23T15:24:31  <janzert> because at least I reason about what food rates are reasonable by how fast I think the player populations should grow (on average, ignoring opponents, etc.) i.e. each player can get a new ant every X turns
2011-06-23T15:24:55  <stocha> janzert: my reonning would be more about max number of ant per game.
2011-06-23T15:24:59  <janzert> not by every X turns each 100x100 section of map should get a new food
2011-06-23T15:25:17  <janzert> stocha: that depends much more on bot strategies than food rate though
2011-06-23T15:25:29  <stocha> janzert: i don't see the value of this player growth factor.
2011-06-23T15:25:48  <stocha> janzert: the upper bound only depend on maximum food spawned during a game.
2011-06-23T15:25:52  <janzert> how long does a player have to maneuver the current ants before expecting to receive another
2011-06-23T15:26:19  <stocha> janzert: it depends on the number of ant.
2011-06-23T15:26:42  <stocha> so if no food is visible at start, it will be high. If 4 food is visible, it will be low. All with same number of food on map.
2011-06-23T15:26:53  <janzert> yes, but especially evident with the bots that aren't terribly smart is that the game won't naturally end until the lead ants reaches a certain density of ants
2011-06-23T15:27:02  <stocha> (arguably if food is very dense, it doesn't change a thing but well)
2011-06-23T15:27:03  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-590c4941.pool.mediaWays.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-23T15:27:13  <janzert> it doesn't matter much how slow or fast those ants actually spawn
2011-06-23T15:27:33  <stocha> janzert: so the density of food is important.
2011-06-23T15:27:40  <stocha> wich the number of player don't affect anyway.
2011-06-23T15:27:48  <janzert> and slowing the spawn rate just increases the game length
2011-06-23T15:27:49  <stocha> why should be food denser when there is more players ?
2011-06-23T15:28:30  <McLeopold> janzert: I think game progress depends more on when bots clash than on number of ants
2011-06-23T15:28:35  <stocha> the question i ask is this : for a fixed map size X, why should food spawn faster when there are 4 players (hence it's more dense) than when there is 2 (hence less dense)
2011-06-23T15:29:08  <antimatroid> games usually don't take that long if the bots aren't all defense rather than any offense
2011-06-23T15:29:08  <stocha> shouldn"t the density be the same, and define the map.
2011-06-23T15:29:08  <janzert> because there are more players to use those ants instead of the food sitting there
2011-06-23T15:29:25  <stocha> the food never sits there
2011-06-23T15:29:30  <antimatroid> and so far it looks to me like some offense is best
2011-06-23T15:29:31  <stocha> the growth is exponential
2011-06-23T15:29:33  <antimatroid> which is awesome
2011-06-23T15:29:35  <janzert> I'm refering to during the growth phase of course
2011-06-23T15:29:43  <stocha> the the number of ant spawned per turn, only depend on food spawn density
2011-06-23T15:30:16  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@nat/google/x-thmqzvelzdjlnpjw> has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
2011-06-23T15:30:26  <stocha> janzert: the growth phase only take a few turn. Or it waits for a food density (example my random bot waits for a food density)
2011-06-23T15:30:51  <stocha> the only bot i know which may not follow this rule is the snake bot.
2011-06-23T15:31:08  <stocha> because it only has one ant active. sort of.
2011-06-23T15:31:31  <stocha> but that's kind rare. and innefficient.
2011-06-23T15:31:33  <McLeopold> stocha: what percentage of land area should spawn each turn? can you give a range?
2011-06-23T15:31:48  <stocha> McLeopold: no.
2011-06-23T15:31:50  <Rabidus> finnish programmers, raise your hands.. NOW! \o/
2011-06-23T15:32:01  <stocha> McLeopold: i can only say that variety is good.
2011-06-23T15:32:12  <McLeopold> that's why I asked for a range :)
2011-06-23T15:32:25  <george1914> i still have a little more code to write before i finnish ...
2011-06-23T15:32:32  <george1914> sorry
2011-06-23T15:32:48  <stocha> McLeopold: i only think it's a good idea to use this particular metric.
2011-06-23T15:32:51  <McLeopold> stocha: can you say how many times faster the fastest rate should be over the slowest?
2011-06-23T15:32:58  <stocha> so let's say we start with around 1/30
2011-06-23T15:33:14  <stocha> McLeopold: no.
2011-06-23T15:33:21  <stocha> McLeopold: the slowest should be 0
2011-06-23T15:33:23  <antimatroid> george1914: who are you apologising to?
2011-06-23T15:33:31  <McLeopold> so, 1 food for every 30 land squares per turn?
2011-06-23T15:33:35  <stocha> McLeopold: so the anwser here :there is no response to your question.
2011-06-23T15:33:39  <george1914> for jokes like that?  everyone
2011-06-23T15:33:54  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I would be interested in seeing some games with less food at least during beta :)
2011-06-23T15:34:12  <stocha> McLeopold: so, let's say from 0 (rare) up to 1/30 (rare also)
2011-06-23T15:34:21  <janzert> one out of every thirty squares every turn? thats seems really, really high
2011-06-23T15:34:26  <stocha> and then we'll adjust if 1/30 is too much.
2011-06-23T15:34:36  <McLeopold> it is really really high :)
2011-06-23T15:34:50  <stocha> janzert: i made experiments with dense food. It was amusing. You have armies then.
2011-06-23T15:34:59  <stocha> although i did that on 256x256 maps.
2011-06-23T15:35:22  <stocha> bot will have to build a severe time management on those map. i know i can do it easilly :)
2011-06-23T15:35:28  <janzert> bots won't have time to maneuver new ants into good positions
2011-06-23T15:35:42  <McLeopold> it also requires more cpu time to process
2011-06-23T15:35:50  <Rabidus> finnish.. like Finlandeses
2011-06-23T15:35:54  <Rabidus> not finish
2011-06-23T15:35:56  <Rabidus> :p
2011-06-23T15:37:42  <stocha> janzert: you understand this game very much more than i then.
2011-06-23T15:38:09  <stocha> McLeopold: it only depends on your algorithm.
2011-06-23T15:38:32  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2011-06-23T15:38:51  <stocha> One thing i insist on is : there should be a upper bound to maps size. There should be a upper bound to maximum number of ants per game. And there should be a possibility the bots will encounter them.
2011-06-23T15:39:17  <stocha> The upper bounds are to be known and settled in stone before the contests starts.
2011-06-23T15:39:27  <antimatroid> you wont get that last bit
2011-06-23T15:39:40  <antimatroid> well, depending on what you mean by the contest starting
2011-06-23T15:39:46  <stocha> If that is done, then it will simply define the game, whatever rules you arbitrarily choose :)
2011-06-23T15:39:54  <stocha> antimatroid: i mean the beta end.
2011-06-23T15:40:13  <antimatroid> we can aim to have good parameters at launch, but we can't assume we'll have found the best maps/parameters at that stage
2011-06-23T15:40:25  <stocha> antimatroid: if i don't get it, then there is a big problem. Because people won't be able to make informed decisions.
2011-06-23T15:40:48  <antimatroid> stocha: everyong has to make the same decisions
2011-06-23T15:41:03  <antimatroid> i agree about the comment of the parameters etc. needing to be as general as they were allowed for
2011-06-23T15:41:10  <stocha> for example, some people won"t care. And either they will time out and loose, or never time out and win.
2011-06-23T15:41:14  <antimatroid> otherwise it becomes a contest of who can make the best assumptions
2011-06-23T15:41:21  <stocha> and some other will design robust algorithm. And maybe be weaker.
2011-06-23T15:41:47  <stocha> antimatroid: exactly. So you have to settle parameters before the contest begin. You have the beta for choosing them though.
2011-06-23T15:42:38  <stocha> I think during the beta some wild thing should be tryed; 1vs1 games, 256x256 games. Very high food rate. 0 food rate. Etc.
2011-06-23T15:42:46  <stocha> Assymetric maps also.
2011-06-23T15:43:01  <george1914> i would prefer parameters to be roughly set by end of beta as well...
2011-06-23T15:43:04  <stocha> all that should be tryed. And eventually then rejected. after we have evidence to discuss.
2011-06-23T15:43:13  <george1914> mainly though, i would like to get to start of contest ...   :)
2011-06-23T15:43:31  <stocha> george1914: why ?
2011-06-23T15:43:48  <stocha> george1914: what does starting it early bring against beta testing ?
2011-06-23T15:44:00  <stocha> george1914: because in fact, you'll be beta testing it.
2011-06-23T15:44:07  <george1914> because i have ideas for algorithms that might or might not work well, depending on map size, density of ants, etc
2011-06-23T15:44:27  <stocha> george1914: yeah, but why do you want it to start early ?
2011-06-23T15:44:27  <george1914> (that is why i like to roughly know parameters)
2011-06-23T15:44:42  <antimatroid> stocha: some of us are impatient people :)
2011-06-23T15:44:51  <george1914> i just want it to start  :)
2011-06-23T15:44:52  <antimatroid> we think of something and want to do it NOW
2011-06-23T15:44:58  <george1914> will be fun
2011-06-23T15:45:08  <stocha> but there is the beta. you can try your ideas. and with the tcp you can compare your bot to others.
2011-06-23T15:45:20  <stocha> what prevent you from doing it.
2011-06-23T15:45:24  <antimatroid> i have my ideas
2011-06-23T15:45:31  <stocha> maybe the server costs.
2011-06-23T15:45:35  <antimatroid> i don't want to implement them without doing it properly
2011-06-23T15:45:45  <stocha> maybe you can't have the same server for the beta and the contest. So that's an argument.
2011-06-23T15:45:47  <antimatroid> randomly throwing stuff into a bot is really messy for development
2011-06-23T15:46:05  <george1914> stocha:  i do not have infinite time for contest - would prefer to only do what turns out to be good, once i know what parameters are
2011-06-23T15:46:42  <stocha> george1914: everybody do. but if you want to know the parameters, some people need to do some extensive testings. Or you might run into not liking the result.
2011-06-23T15:46:53  *** gobang <gobang!~gobang@89.204.153.138> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2011-06-23T15:47:40  <stocha> Okay, so we need to settle all the contests code. And then we need to have enougth data to choose a good set of parameters.
2011-06-23T15:48:07  <stocha> hence we should try as many things as we can, during the time needed for testing the contests code (workers etc)
2011-06-23T15:48:28  <stocha> then it won't extend the testing period. Only give more information out of it( roughly)
2011-06-23T15:48:45  <george1914> stocha:  i think organisers have a decent setup, i am happy to go with something that seems roughly good enough.   trying all you suggest seems like a time-waste to me ..   just go with something good enough instead of imagining perfection can be achieved ...
2011-06-23T15:49:09  <stocha> george1914: okay. you have a point in there i think.
2011-06-23T15:49:31  <george1914> anyway, you wont know the 'best' parameters until the top bots have been written - which wont happen until parameters are fixed  :/
2011-06-23T15:49:34  <stocha> george1914: if what i propose make thing more complicated ant time consuming for core team, then it may not be worth it.

2011-06-23T15:53:55  <antimatroid> george1914: haven't programmed anything like that, and i worry about the ability to use game trees
2011-06-23T15:54:07  <george1914> am pondering adding an 'enemy evaluation' function
2011-06-23T15:54:24  <stocha> i have some more testing about non combat stuff to do first. Then i might consider implementing something for combat. i would take a few more week i guess.
2011-06-23T15:54:25  <antimatroid> i wanted to partition "battle ants" up into sets of ants that could affect each other then use game trees to select those moves, but SOOO many states to churn through :\
2011-06-23T15:54:38  <george1914> ah, well i have clever tricks for that :)  only takes 10s a move atm  :/
2011-06-23T15:54:46  <antimatroid> only? :P
2011-06-23T15:54:50  <stocha> :)
2011-06-23T15:55:02  <stocha> 10s a move is pretty good. if your bot is very strong.
2011-06-23T15:55:09  <antimatroid> george1914: so you're partitioning the ants and running game trees in 10 seconds?
2011-06-23T15:55:09  <stocha> george1914: what language are you using ?
2011-06-23T15:55:15  <antimatroid> that's a lot better than i would have expected
2011-06-23T15:55:20  <george1914> c++
2011-06-23T15:55:40  <george1914> yes, well, i only search to 1move deep atm  :/
2011-06-23T15:55:49  <antimatroid> yes, i don't expect to go further
2011-06-23T15:55:59  <stocha> george1914: still with pure optimization, you can reach 1s. and then by doing a bit less, you can reach the 0,5 pretty good. If it make you very strong.
2011-06-23T15:56:01  <antimatroid> have you got a cap on the maximum size of a partition?
2011-06-23T15:56:16  <george1914> no - but i will have to add one
2011-06-23T15:56:22  <stocha> george1914: it seems promising though.
2011-06-23T15:56:26  <antimatroid> george1914: what's your evaluation function like?
2011-06-23T15:56:34  <antimatroid> you don't have zero sum anymore?
2011-06-23T15:56:36  <george1914> er, bad
2011-06-23T15:56:48  <george1914> atm (i just finished first draft)
2011-06-23T15:56:55  <george1914> +1 for each ant of mine
2011-06-23T15:57:00  <george1914> -1 for each enemy ant
2011-06-23T15:57:17  <george1914> and enemy always moves after me, and goes for worst move for me
2011-06-23T15:57:34  <george1914> so it makes for a cautious/timid player
2011-06-23T15:57:50  <antimatroid> how are you evaluating the state? you're not evaluating the whole board i hope? you should be able to iteratively work out the result for each ant in the partition
2011-06-23T15:57:52  <george1914> that misses lots of good moves because enemy
2011-06-23T15:58:01  <george1914> no, just the local area
2011-06-23T15:58:09  <antimatroid> george1914: yeah, that's how i set my game trees up
2011-06-23T15:58:41  <george1914> anyway, the main thing is that i cannot reliably predict enemy moves in this non-zero-sum game
2011-06-23T15:58:58  <antimatroid> no, my intention is to do backward induction slightly differently
2011-06-23T15:59:29  <antimatroid> rather than bringing up a players worst outcome from the best alternatives of the moving player, i'm going to bring up the worst outcome from any alternative to anyone but the moving player
2011-06-23T15:59:37  <antimatroid> so you don't assume opponents are rational/optimal
2011-06-23T15:59:58  <george1914> that is what i am doing, i think
2011-06-23T16:00:13  <george1914> but i miss many chances to get good kill ratio
2011-06-23T16:00:23  <antimatroid> you could get really complicated there and use a tit for tat like strategy as to whether you want to cooperate with an enemy, or "data" on how good bots are as to whether you think they'd move optimally, but i think i've decided against both of those
2011-06-23T16:00:43  <george1914> because the enemy (my own older bots atm) do not try 100% to damage me - they play for themselves
2011-06-23T16:01:41  <antimatroid> how do you implement your game trees? I usually have 2 structs, Tree and Node, then I have a queue of extendable nodes that I iteratively generate the tree from for as long as I allocate time to it
2011-06-23T16:02:35  <antimatroid> also, i refuse to use alpha beta while generating my tree :P
2011-06-23T16:02:37  <george1914> er, recursive functions
2011-06-23T16:02:48  <george1914> like for alpha-beta in chess
2011-06-23T16:04:41  <george1914> so, maybe i write MI6 function to report eg - 'enemy indentified as stocha snakebot - deploy mongoose tactic' ...          :)
2011-06-23T16:05:27  <antimatroid> i like my strategy to be as general as possible
2011-06-23T16:06:28  <george1914> well, if i play only against strong(ish) opponents, i can assume a fair degree of optimality in their play, maybe
2011-06-23T16:08:01  <antimatroid> i'd be more inclined to just track how many kills vs deaths the ant has
2011-06-23T16:08:24  <george1914> yes, i was thinking of that -
2011-06-23T16:08:24  <antimatroid> and judge the opponent bots abilities off that information rather than trying to identify the bot individually
2011-06-23T16:08:57  <george1914> it is not entirely trivial to keep track of it, is it?   - i dont see where enemy moved to, just the dead ants at the end of the turn ...
2011-06-23T16:08:58  * antimatroid has a lot of trouble using bot/ant in the right place

2011-06-23T16:09:23  <antimatroid> george1914: you can search around the dead ant information to see which enemies contributed to it's death?
2011-06-23T16:09:26  <george1914> attributing kills accurately is not quite possible, i suspect
2011-06-23T16:09:27  <antimatroid> including other dead ants
2011-06-23T16:09:39  <antimatroid> you might not get perfect information on the edge of vision, but it's better than no information
2011-06-23T16:09:56  <george1914> hm, forensic battlefield examination
2011-06-23T16:10:07  <antimatroid> hehe :)
2011-06-23T16:10:11  <george1914> yes, you are right, thanks
2011-06-23T16:10:30  <george1914> i should add that
2011-06-23T16:11:29  <antimatroid> well, having said all that i'm not sure if i am going to make use of the information
2011-06-23T16:11:50  <antimatroid> so i tend to just ignore the info atm, but really it's just a function you need to call after reading the state info
2011-06-23T16:12:15  <george1914> yes - time-cost i minimal
2011-06-23T16:12:24  <george1914> sorry, 'is minimal'
2011-06-23T16:12:40  <george1914> i would be interested to know kill ratios
2011-06-23T16:12:56  <antimatroid> i am not sure whether to evaluate based on the scoring
2011-06-23T16:12:59  <antimatroid> or just raw ant numbers
2011-06-23T16:13:18  <antimatroid> i might do the former i think
2011-06-23T16:13:56  <george1914> i reckon:  damn the scoring - power/survival is the main thing - the points will follow
2011-06-23T16:14:10  <george1914> unless the games are made really short
2011-06-23T16:14:29  <antimatroid> but the scoring should be able to encapsulate that anyway
2011-06-23T16:14:40  <antimatroid> while also making sure you optimise for any micro intricacies it has
2011-06-23T16:15:17  <george1914> well, if you could predict final score from your moves, then yes

2011-06-23T16:15:33  <george1914> but in fact, all you know is change in score at this/next move
2011-06-23T16:15:52  <antimatroid> yes, but you're picking the best move in comparison to other moves
2011-06-23T16:15:56  <antimatroid> for incrementing your score now
2011-06-23T16:16:12  <george1914> i say that #ants you have +production capacity  is probably what you should optimise
2011-06-23T16:16:28  <antimatroid> you will be a very defensive bot if you do that :P
2011-06-23T16:16:50  <george1914> whereas you are saying  'hey i'm winning this marathon race because i am at the front at mile 2'
2011-06-23T16:17:15  <george1914> postion before the finish is not everything
2011-06-23T16:17:30  <george1914> no - i will expand to increase production
2011-06-23T16:17:31  <antimatroid> no it's not, but it can be hard to come back with ai
2011-06-23T16:17:47  <antimatroid> ah well, variation of strategies is good :)
2011-06-23T16:18:04  <antimatroid> it sounds like we have a lot of the same ideas otherwise
2011-06-23T16:18:19  <george1914> if at move 100 we have same number of ants, but you have higher score because you killed lots of enemies, we are still ~level
2011-06-23T16:18:25  <stocha> i'm afraid george1914 is quite right.
2011-06-23T16:18:37  <george1914> stocha:  thanks
2011-06-23T16:18:56  <george1914> but dont tell everyone  :)
2011-06-23T16:19:25  <antimatroid> george1914: not necessarily
2011-06-23T16:19:36  <antimatroid> the amount of territory you have also affects the amount of food you have first access to
2011-06-23T16:19:36  <stocha> well not really afraid. it's just an expression. maybe from the return of the jedi. The emperor says that :"I'm afraid your the shield will be on, when your friend arrive" or something like that. he is afraid of something.
2011-06-23T16:19:42  <antimatroid> taking out enemies increases your territory
2011-06-23T16:20:26  <george1914> ok, so measure territory/production in payoff function,   but dont worry about score too much
2011-06-23T16:20:44  <stocha> you can't know the score can you ?
2011-06-23T16:20:53  <stocha> i mean the engine doesn't send it to you ?
2011-06-23T16:20:58  <george1914> you can know your own ...
2011-06-23T16:20:59  <antimatroid> stocha: you can know the relative change in score
2011-06-23T16:21:12  <stocha> (well even if it does, i don't certainly don't what to do with it but well)
2011-06-23T16:21:21  <stocha> antimatroid: you receive that ?
2011-06-23T16:21:29  <antimatroid> stocha: you have dead ant information
2011-06-23T16:21:41  <stocha> antimatroid: yeah ? what to do with it ?
2011-06-23T16:21:48  <antimatroid> also, when you're making your moves, you implement the scoring system yourself
2011-06-23T16:21:50  <george1914> if you know where the bodies are buried ...
2011-06-23T16:21:58  <stocha> so you end up with aproximating a useless value.
2011-06-23T16:22:06  <stocha> and then ?
2011-06-23T16:22:07  <antimatroid> just like you have to implement battle resolution and ant spawning etc.
2011-06-23T16:22:19  <antimatroid> it's not necessarily useless
2011-06-23T16:22:30  <antimatroid> you can use the information when selecting moves from a game tree
2011-06-23T16:22:40  <stocha> the score go higher when your ants dies, than when they do not.
2011-06-23T16:22:47  <stocha> doesn't it ?
2011-06-23T16:22:56  <stocha> or is it only food and kill that gives score.
2011-06-23T16:22:59  <stocha> maybe it is. mm
2011-06-23T16:23:12  <stocha> still i don' think it's usefull for decision making.
2011-06-23T16:23:15  <antimatroid> you can do something like yourScore-enemiesScores or whatever you want to evaluate with
2011-06-23T16:23:28  <stocha> antimatroid: what's the point ?
2011-06-23T16:23:37  <antimatroid> then you pick whatever move does the best change in score between you and your enemies at each decision, and they do the same
2011-06-23T16:23:50  <antimatroid> stocha: this is how most people do ai :P
2011-06-23T16:23:56  <stocha> by score you mean value of the evaluation function then.
2011-06-23T16:23:57  <antimatroid> in games*
2011-06-23T16:24:05  <george1914> ok, i think i go now.   nice talking to yous, as always, antimatroid, stocha   :)   bye

If the food were to stop arriving at some point then the ants could turn to attacking more readily, but right now it's barely worth their while to bunch up

2011-06-23T20:47:10  <janzert> I'll stop looking at the game cutoff change difference at 35000
2011-06-23T20:49:05  <janzert> so the big difference overall with the cutoff is it moves 10% of games that would have gone for a full 2000 turns and ends them in less than 200
2011-06-23T20:56:34  <McLeopold> what's the average cutoff?
2011-06-23T20:57:32  <janzert> average length? I didn't look at cutoff lengths separately at this point
2011-06-23T20:58:00  <McLeopold> I guess, average number of turns prevented, assuming cutoff games go the full length
2011-06-23T20:58:37  <janzert> with cutoff enabled the average game length is 702 without it was 869
2011-06-23T20:58:40  <McLeopold> I'm also thinking of dropping the game length to 1500.  Have you seen winning or ranking turn above that?

2011-06-23T20:59:41  <janzert> right now about 14% of games go longer than 1500 turns
2011-06-23T21:00:08  <McLeopold> oh, which game when 1988?
2011-06-23T21:00:35  <janzert> games involving a top ten player less than 5% of games go beyond 1500 though
2011-06-23T21:00:52  <janzert> oops, just over 5%
2011-06-23T21:01:10  <janzert> 5.444444...%
2011-06-23T21:01:39  <McLeopold> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=34763
2011-06-23T21:01:46  <McLeopold> not a great game, but a late win
2011-06-23T21:08:26  <McLeopold> janzert: the average game that goes 2000 turns stops change the rank at about 1000 turns
2011-06-23T21:10:19  <McLeopold> out of 451 games, 12 would be different due to a cutoff at 1500
2011-06-23T21:12:09  <McLeopold> the blocking in this is pretty cool http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=35148

2011-06-23T21:14:48  <McLeopold> I think I'll keep the insane presicion for next game calcs. :D
2011-06-23T21:15:16  <janzert> there are the histograms for cutoff and no cutoff games both all games played and games involving a top 10 player only
2011-06-23T21:15:21  <janzert> hehe
2011-06-23T21:15:50  <janzert> including -0.10... minutes eh ;)
2011-06-23T21:15:56  <McLeopold> what's the y axis?
2011-06-23T21:16:33  <McLeopold> some people need validation that they *are* overdue for a game :)
2011-06-23T21:16:45  <janzert> first bucket is less than 100 turns, second less than 200 and so on
2011-06-23T21:17:13  <janzert> blue bars show the percentage that fall in that bucket red bars are the cumulative percentage
2011-06-23T21:17:23  <McLeopold> oic

2011-06-23T21:18:41  <McLeopold> okay, I'll make the parameter switch now
2011-06-23T21:18:41  <janzert> I think the changes between no cutoff and cutoff show that it's working really well
2011-06-23T21:19:08  <janzert> it looks like most of the change is in games that would have otherwise gone to the turn limit anyway
2011-06-23T21:19:22  <janzert> sounds good
2011-06-23T21:19:50  <McLeopold> should I try lowering the cutoff?
2011-06-23T21:20:01  <McLeopold> 85%?
2011-06-23T21:20:20  <McLeopold> I want to error on the side of more games just to test

2011-06-23T21:20:47  <janzert> I wouldn't mind testing, but I don't like the idea of mixing it in with other parameter changes
2011-06-23T21:21:11  <McLeopold> okay, I'll wait for that
2011-06-23T21:21:19  <McLeopold> game length is now 1500
2011-06-23T21:21:36  <McLeopold> let's see if the gmp goes up
2011-06-23T21:21:41  <McLeopold> gpm
2011-06-23T21:21:42  <janzert> I'd also like to add a per map maximum game length
2011-06-23T21:21:53  <janzert> that is dynamically adjusted
2011-06-23T21:22:34  <_flag> Your next game should be in about 6.146689498383561643000000000000 minutes.

2011-06-23T21:24:58  <_flag> McLeopold: Yeah I noticed that
2011-06-23T21:25:07  <_flag> How are you distributing the match making?
2011-06-23T21:25:51  <_flag> Could it possibly be because nobody wants to seed me into their games? D:
2011-06-23T21:25:56  <McLeopold> pick the person to have a game the longest time ago
2011-06-23T21:26:05  <McLeopold> Then pick good matches for that player
2011-06-23T21:26:22  <_flag> I'm probably rarely a good match
2011-06-23T21:26:30  <McLeopold> so, my bot is probably getting picked more often than yours for playing against the seed
2011-06-23T21:27:20  <janzert> hmm, seeding by least recently played should be helping compensate some but maybe not fully for that
2011-06-23T21:27:34  <janzert> and apparently it isn't
2011-06-23T21:27:40  <McLeopold> if he is never the best match, he will have the slowest rate
2011-06-23T21:27:43  <antimatroid> it means he'd be picked more often as the player to pick others from yeah?
2011-06-23T21:28:16  <_flag> Uhhh... "Your next game should be in about -1.367493112024861690000000000000 minutes."
2011-06-23T21:28:18  <janzert> yes, but it may still not be enough
2011-06-23T21:28:34  <antimatroid> doesn't it pick the bot with the least number of games?
2011-06-23T21:28:37  <McLeopold> I need to put in a few more "no replay" exclusions
2011-06-23T21:28:55  <janzert> especially if matchups aren't spreading out the pairings enough
2011-06-23T21:29:00  <McLeopold> A match is usually considered better when the sigma is low
2011-06-23T21:29:42  <janzert> what happened to don't add anyone that has played with any of the current players in their last 5 games?

2011-06-23T21:33:12  <McLeopold> clearly we have code issues whenever the page render is above 1000ms
2011-06-23T21:33:35  <janzert> with 97 active players and a minimum of 4 players per game how can someone go 51 games without getting a game?
2011-06-23T21:34:23  <McLeopold> I've noticed the "player_ahead" often drop by 2
2011-06-23T21:34:47  <McLeopold> meaning only 2 distinct users that were behind just played
2011-06-23T21:35:03  <McLeopold> also meaning that 2 or more players got 2 games in since your last one
2011-06-23T21:35:29  <antimatroid> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=35001&user=126
2011-06-23T21:35:31  <McLeopold> There should be a certain amount of that, but I'm not sure what the correct amount is
2011-06-23T21:35:34  <antimatroid> how to finish a game in 132 turns
2011-06-23T21:35:48  <McLeopold> If it was on a strict rotation, you'd always play the same bots
2011-06-23T21:36:28  <McLeopold> there we go, cpu to 100 percent for 10 seconds
2011-06-23T21:36:28  <janzert> server network issues again?
2011-06-23T21:36:58  <janzert> oh, maybe that was me trying to view flagcapper's profile page
2011-06-23T21:37:45  <McLeopold> I think it's both network and some sql stuff going on
2011-06-23T21:38:13  <janzert> hmm, yeah my ssh session seems flaky as well
2011-06-23T21:38:18  <McLeopold> the next_game_in was running in < 0.03 seconds most of the time
2011-06-23T21:38:36  <_flag> Is the matchmaking done on the server? The players ahead of me just went down as it loaded
2011-06-23T21:38:43  <McLeopold> I can't think of any change that should have affected it this much
2011-06-23T21:39:01  <McLeopold> _flag: yes and what?
2011-06-23T21:39:16  <janzert> ping is showing quite a bit of packet loss at the moment
2011-06-23T21:39:25  <_flag> Maybe that could explain why it seems to slow down periodically and then speed back up again
2011-06-23T21:39:33  <McLeopold> janzert: so, not my code?
2011-06-23T21:39:48  <janzert> is slow queries on and did it trigger? :)
2011-06-23T21:40:02  <McLeopold> as soon as I get control of ssh again, I can check
2011-06-23T21:40:16  <janzert> but I think it's a good chance most of the slow page loads are and such are network related right now
2011-06-23T21:40:35  <janzert> ooh, host unreachable now
2011-06-23T21:40:36  <McLeopold> okay, that means slow queries wouldn't be triggered then
2011-06-23T21:40:47  <janzert> right if it's truly the network
2011-06-23T21:41:01  <_flag> Now it's instantaneous for me
2011-06-23T21:41:15  <McLeopold> so, when do we get the real vps? :)
2011-06-23T21:41:25  <_flag> So I think it finished doing whatever it was doing
2011-06-23T21:41:35  <_flag> Or maybe not...
2011-06-23T21:41:54  <janzert> _flag: more likely the router decided to let some traffic through :(

2011-06-23T21:42:53  <janzert> or wait is that the manager update?
2011-06-23T21:43:02  <janzert> not so bad if so
2011-06-23T21:43:22  <McLeopold> yeah, something is up with the leaderboard stuff
2011-06-23T21:44:08  <janzert> yeah, it does look like mysql is sitting at 100% cpu an inordinate amount
2011-06-23T21:44:53  <janzert> heh, 121 packets transmitted, 53 received, +2 errors, 56% packet loss, time 342086ms
2011-06-23T21:45:00  <janzert> not a great ping run there
2011-06-23T21:46:28  <McLeopold> janzert: I flushed the data and we are back to 1 second
2011-06-23T21:46:58  <McLeopold> hmm, 2.5 on a clean table
2011-06-23T21:47:08  <McLeopold> I'll see if I can make that faster later.
2011-06-23T21:47:17  <janzert> the next game calculation is rather weird, 17 players ahead, current rate 4.333 players per minute and next game in -1.52 minutes
2011-06-23T21:47:23  <McLeopold> Perhaps I need to add archiving to the manager :)
2011-06-23T21:47:44  <McLeopold> for who?
2011-06-23T21:48:04  <janzert> that is from flagcapper
2011-06-23T21:48:49  <McLeopold> perhaps the workers went down
2011-06-23T21:48:55  <janzert> I would expect the next game calculation to be players ahead / game rate though?
2011-06-23T21:49:16  <janzert> maybe with another constant division for jumping in line
2011-06-23T21:49:24  <McLeopold> minus current average time elapsed from running games
2011-06-23T21:49:52  <McLeopold> he was in a game
2011-06-23T21:50:02  <McLeopold> I suppose I could check for that?
2011-06-23T21:50:47  <janzert> what I used to do is if they had a game scheduled that wasn't too far down the queue just sage the next game should be soon
2011-06-23T21:50:59  <janzert> s/sage/say
2011-06-23T21:51:16  <McLeopold> I think I'll just check if they are in the matchup table
2011-06-23T21:51:29  <McLeopold> since it is generated on the fly
2011-06-23T21:51:34  <janzert> yeah, that should be fine now since matches aren't scheduled so far ahead anymore
2011-06-23T21:51:52  <McLeopold> I could even give a list of players they are in the match with
