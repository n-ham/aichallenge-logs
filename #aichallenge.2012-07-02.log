2012-07-02T10:00:39  <delt0r> hay hay hay... what is up everyone ..
2012-07-02T10:00:55  * delt0r is procrastinating from writing his talk
2012-07-02T10:01:30  <delt0r> in terms of the next comp, what is the game most would support?
2012-07-02T10:01:39  <delt0r> Asteroids?
2012-07-02T10:02:44  <mcstar> lets write automatic theorem provers
2012-07-02T10:06:37  <mcstar> whatever, then asteroids it is
2012-07-02T10:09:50  <delt0r> mcstar: i forget you want the hard core abstract challenge
2012-07-02T10:10:13  <mcstar> is it too much to ask?
2012-07-02T10:10:16  <mcstar> XD
2012-07-02T10:10:19  <delt0r> well... yea
2012-07-02T10:10:21  <delt0r> :D
2012-07-02T10:10:30  <delt0r> at least for the core game
2012-07-02T10:10:50  <delt0r> I was thinking if we can get a bit of momentum going we can have two challenges per year
2012-07-02T10:10:58  <delt0r> the core one... and an extra one
2012-07-02T10:11:12  <mcstar> big if
2012-07-02T10:11:18  <delt0r> the extra can relax some of the newb requirements... or even be a repeat
2012-07-02T10:11:38  <delt0r> I don't think it would be much work once the framework is in a good state
2012-07-02T10:12:10  <delt0r> I do know that about 2 per year is about right... most seem to want it
2012-07-02T10:12:21  <delt0r> many want to enter 2x per year
2012-07-02T10:12:52  <delt0r> trick is to have the next one almost ready to roll when the current one is playing...
2012-07-02T10:12:58  <mcstar> there is an incessant amount of programmers, so challenges are never enough
2012-07-02T10:13:08  <delt0r> true
2012-07-02T10:13:43  <delt0r> but i think one per semester is about right anyways... and that uni sponsership ... could work in well with course material
