2010-10-13T01:10:40  <janzert> thanks
2010-10-13T01:10:55  <sigh> that's a very weak password
2010-10-13T01:11:16  <amstan> janzert: i know man, get a better password in the future
2010-10-13T01:11:18  <janzert> :) most common password out there in a lot of common password lists
2010-10-13T01:11:26  <janzert> might as well join the crowd
2010-10-13T01:11:27  <Zannick> so, just going off the code
2010-10-13T01:11:44  <Zannick> everything looks good
2010-10-13T01:12:15  <amstan> janzert: btw.. just use -p next time
2010-10-13T01:12:22  <Zannick> was a little worried about making the temp folder in the submissions dir, but then i read mkdtemp and it has prefix="tmp" as default
2010-10-13T01:12:27  <amstan> having the password in bash history is not cool
2010-10-13T01:12:46  <janzert> ahh, yeah that is true.
2010-10-13T01:13:09  <janzert> yep
2010-10-13T01:13:15  <amstan> janzert: refresh
2010-10-13T01:13:21  <janzert> it makes names like "tmp123456" or so
2010-10-13T01:13:55  <janzert> thanks much, amstan
2010-10-13T01:14:13  <Zannick> yeah, and that doesn't conflict since the non-tmp directories are numbers only
2010-10-13T01:14:22  <Zannick> just one thing i want you to do
2010-10-13T01:14:24  <Zannick> really minor
2010-10-13T01:14:29  <Zannick> get rid of the semicolon :)

2010-10-13T01:15:36  <janzert> ahh, yes
2010-10-13T01:15:40  <Zannick> not your fault :) and it does nothing anyway
2010-10-13T01:15:47  <janzert> yep
2010-10-13T01:16:20  <janzert> bah, I'm going to have to let my tower break down on its own now
2010-10-13T01:17:42  <Zannick> so yeah, looks good to me, but i haven't done any testing either
2010-10-13T01:18:43  <janzert> I'll definitely test it and check it in on a branch for someone to do one more look over it
2010-10-13T01:19:46  <janzert> I'll follow your lead though and just branch the backend directory, a little nicer that way for this
2010-10-13T01:20:55  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-13T01:21:12  <Zannick> branch the backend directory of another branch, hahaha
2010-10-13T01:21:21  <janzert> yep :)

2010-10-13T05:37:32  <Naktibalda> no competition here
2010-10-13T05:38:18  <Naktibalda> GenericBob had a higher ranking for a few times, but he didn't submit since 28th of September
2010-10-13T05:38:27  <byteroot> yep
2010-10-13T05:39:40  <byteroot> Did you ever been timeouted, or server speed is enough ?
2010-10-13T05:40:02  <byteroot> Don't think php is fastest choice =)
2010-10-13T05:40:51  <Naktibalda> I'm not doing enough calculations to have such issue
2010-10-13T05:42:04  <byteroot> I had, at my virtual pc, but it is really slow and low mem.
2010-10-13T05:46:07  <Naktibalda> where is that server status page?
2010-10-13T05:47:11  <byteroot> don't think there any
2010-10-13T05:48:15  <Naktibalda> there is a page, that displays an average number of games per minute (+ average of last hour, 24hours) on each servers
2010-10-13T05:48:24  <Naktibalda> server
2010-10-13T05:49:04  <Naktibalda> the main server can generate ~6 games per minute
2010-10-13T05:49:32  <byteroot> hm
2010-10-13T05:49:36  <Naktibalda> 2 other servers are some kind of virtual Amazon servers that works only when computing time is cheap

2010-10-13T07:38:24  <rabidus> just asked :D
2010-10-13T07:38:50  <rabidus> so you need somekinda proxy tcp :)
2010-10-13T07:39:22  <rabidus> send your sourcecode to that which compiles it and runs with tcp and gives results
2010-10-13T07:40:49  <Naktibalda> use a shell host (free or payed)
2010-10-13T07:41:11  <rabidus> nice idea
2010-10-13T07:44:02  <Naktibalda> I had network issues too before they increased timeout
2010-10-13T07:44:52  <Naktibalda> I used shellmix.com for 2 weeks. It's the only freeshell server that has an easy registration

2010-10-13T08:13:22  <Naktibalda> it's ignored by server, but a valid move
2010-10-13T08:13:30  <rabidus> i think that too
2010-10-13T08:13:37  <dmj111> Naktibalda: thanks... i wasn't sure.
2010-10-13T08:13:54  <rabidus> but, if you send 0 size fleet and then on the same turn 1 size fleet to same planet
2010-10-13T08:13:57  <rabidus> then it's invalid move
2010-10-13T08:14:01  <rabidus> i think..
2010-10-13T08:14:02  <rabidus> :)
2010-10-13T08:14:55  <Naktibalda> why?
2010-10-13T08:15:03  <Naktibalda> server merges fleets
2010-10-13T08:15:20  <Naktibalda> you can send more than 1 fleet from a to  b
2010-10-13T08:15:21  <javagamer> Naktibalda, does the server merge fleets now?

2010-10-13T10:13:34  <Naktibalda> "Last 24 hours" average is dropping fast, so it's getting close to 24hours without EC2
2010-10-13T10:15:21  <rebelxt_> current spot price on small instances is 0.03$ per hour which is normal, so i think there is another problem - not pricing/availability of servers

2010-10-13T11:59:22  <JamesMG> I should've picked up that 90 ship planet on the bottom right to bring it even at least
2010-10-13T11:59:53  <Gudradain> I just remove all my attacking code and just put defense and expansion, than I just send the overstock (over 100) to the nearest planet
2010-10-13T12:00:09  <Gudradain> really dumb but it beat my old bot that was rank 90...
2010-10-13T12:00:19  <Gudradain> I wonder why

2010-10-13T12:03:33  <deepblue> he's quite good
2010-10-13T12:06:09  <Gudradain> It's strange because Hazard and rsergio are playing completely differently but are both on top
2010-10-13T12:06:29  <Gudradain> Hazard is all on attack, while rsergio is a bit more defensive
2010-10-13T12:07:26  <rebelxt> it's nice to see different strategies work well

2010-10-13T12:10:13  <Gudradain> would be nice but it would mess up my strat
2010-10-13T12:10:14  <delt0r_> but how long to play a game
2010-10-13T12:10:16  <JamesMG> would see a lot of bots timeout at first I'm sure
2010-10-13T12:10:20  <rebelxt> deepblue: my bot would time out on 2nd turn!
2010-10-13T12:10:28  <delt0r_> and how long before the server even got through a round
2010-10-13T12:11:28  <deepblue> i know
2010-10-13T12:11:32  <deepblue> but I want it!

2010-10-13T13:29:08  <cfaftw> yeah i already started watching some of your games :)
2010-10-13T13:29:58  <Meatkat> haha, the one where I beat CCCF-ex9 is interesting
2010-10-13T13:30:16  <JamesMG> you are about to get another win
2010-10-13T13:30:23  <Meatkat> I disabled my "don't send too many from one planet" calculations for this version, I need to put that back in so I stop looking like a noob
2010-10-13T13:31:05  <Meatkat> JamesMG: why do you say that?
2010-10-13T13:31:11  <JamesMG> I know my bot :)
2010-10-13T13:32:23  <Meatkat> your the honolulu series?
2010-10-13T13:32:43  <JamesMG> no
2010-10-13T13:32:48  <rebelxt> Meatkat, win against CCCF was good one
2010-10-13T13:33:41  <bhasker> yup west coast here
2010-10-13T13:34:00  <Meatkat> rebelxt: thanks
2010-10-13T13:34:17  <bhasker> my bot has gotten a little better but still have bugs to fix :-\

2010-10-13T13:36:12  <cfaftw> bhasker, yeah he said he took out that code for this version
2010-10-13T13:36:15  <Meatkat> bhasker: yeah... hence my previous comment about disabling my "don't send too many away from one planet" and "looking like a noob" lol
2010-10-13T13:37:25  <bhasker> aah :D
2010-10-13T13:38:04  <cfaftw> actually some of the top bots seem to lack any control over sending too many ships from one planet
2010-10-13T13:38:23  <cfaftw> meaning, on turn 1 they send all their ships
2010-10-13T13:38:34  <cfaftw> but they are only like 4 turns from the enemy starting planet
2010-10-13T13:38:40  <cfaftw> instant death
2010-10-13T13:38:57  <rebelxt> cfaftw: profit!
2010-10-13T13:39:21  <cfaftw> $_$
2010-10-13T13:39:23  <bhasker> otherwise your bot kicked my bots ass mostly:-\
2010-10-13T13:39:44  <bhasker> also i guess the bots on tcp have gotten much better
2010-10-13T13:39:49  <bhasker> elo rating climb is slow and painful

2010-10-13T13:40:36  <rebelxt> cfaftw: not true, my bot is getting worse! ;-)

2010-10-13T13:41:15  <cfaftw> well... as a general rule :P
2010-10-13T13:41:38  <rebelxt> cfaftw: where is your jetbot? i wanna try my new suicidal bot against it
2010-10-13T13:41:54  <bhasker> ah jetbot is your cfaftw interesting bot
2010-10-13T13:42:00  <bhasker> what was the reason for the name
2010-10-13T13:42:03  <cfaftw> give me a minute... i'll put it up on the TCP server
2010-10-13T13:42:31  <cfaftw> bhasker, a long time ago, some my friends nicknamed me "The Jet"
2010-10-13T13:42:44  <cfaftw> so i just named one of my versions after that
2010-10-13T13:42:45  <cfaftw> for no reason

2010-10-13T13:45:16  <rebelxt> Meatkat: you are still running your bot, right? i started mine a few minutes ago, hope we get a game or two
2010-10-13T13:45:29  <cfaftw> no, but i will
2010-10-13T13:45:52  <Meatkat> rebelxt: yup, I think I put it to run 1000 games
2010-10-13T13:45:53  <bhasker> lovebot is quite good
2010-10-13T13:45:58  <Meatkat> so... it'll be there for a while
2010-10-13T13:45:58  <bhasker> keeps kicking my bots ass :(
2010-10-13T13:46:15  <rebelxt> i've gotta admit i'm scared of jetbot showing up in a few minutes and stomping all over my buggy bot ;-)
2010-10-13T13:46:30  <cfaftw> eh... mine's not that great anymore
2010-10-13T13:46:38  <cfaftw> but we'll see
2010-10-13T13:46:41  <rebelxt> Meatkat: cool i'm in for ~100 games so we'll probably get matched soon
2010-10-13T13:46:44  <cfaftw> it's mostly just that i haven't worked on it
2010-10-13T13:46:52  <Meatkat> which are you bhasker?

2010-10-13T13:47:08  <cfaftw> i've been working on a new (similar) bot, that is more neatly organized and maintainable
2010-10-13T13:47:10  <bhasker> switched the name around
2010-10-13T13:47:17  <bhasker> after i rewrote the core
2010-10-13T13:47:33  <JamesMG> oh, malazan is you.  That thing likes to kill my bot
2010-10-13T13:47:38  <bhasker> hehe:D
2010-10-13T13:47:59  <Meatkat> JamesMG which is your bot?
2010-10-13T13:48:04  <JamesMG> JamesMG.dev
2010-10-13T13:48:17  <bhasker> my bot is kinda stupid though sometimes it will beat like a top 10 bot
2010-10-13T13:48:25  <bhasker> and then on some maps it will go lose to -300 elo rated bot
2010-10-13T13:48:26  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-13T13:48:38  <JamesMG> was trying a different expansion method recently that hasn't worked particularly well
2010-10-13T13:48:59  <rebelxt> bhasker: probably an issue with ship distribution during first 1-2 turns
2010-10-13T13:49:07  <bhasker> yea my second turn needs fixing
2010-10-13T13:49:09  <bhasker> first is fine
2010-10-13T13:49:18  <bhasker> still thinking on a better second turn strat
2010-10-13T13:49:23  <bhasker> it picks bad planets sometimes
2010-10-13T13:49:33  <bhasker> and ends up overcommitting to acquiring a new neutral
2010-10-13T13:49:46  <bhasker> when it should be trying to defend the one it sent ships to in turn 1
2010-10-13T13:49:55  <bhasker> i end up with a very bad ship differential
2010-10-13T13:50:25  <rebelxt> what i found is that scoring function needs to be different during first 1-2 turns.. well, the same function, but a few parameters are different.. dunno if others had similar experience
2010-10-13T13:50:42  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-13T13:50:49  <bhasker> i use a different algorithm altogether on turn 1
2010-10-13T13:50:59  <bhasker> but i am thinking maybe i need to do it differently for turn 2
2010-10-13T13:51:04  <bhasker> as well
2010-10-13T13:51:13  <Naktibalda> it is different, all cheap targets are taken on turn 1
2010-10-13T13:51:32  <krokokrusa> and then devise 198 different algorithms for the remaining turns..
2010-10-13T13:52:14  <bhasker> well turn 2-200 is the same strat for my bot ^
2010-10-13T13:52:20  <cfaftw> brb
2010-10-13T13:52:20  <bhasker> but i am thinking of adding some kamikaze moves

2010-10-13T13:52:43  <bhasker> do like a shock attack of launching a large number of ships
2010-10-13T13:52:49  <bhasker> or something
2010-10-13T13:52:54  <bhasker> maybe the other bot does something stupid
2010-10-13T13:52:56  <krokokrusa> kamikaze sounds fun
2010-10-13T13:53:01  <bhasker> but last time i tried that
2010-10-13T13:53:05  <bhasker> i lost all my planets

2010-10-13T13:53:13  <krokokrusa> especially close to the end, when it's clear what you're losing
2010-10-13T13:53:17  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-13T13:53:45  <Meatkat> rebelxt what is your bots name?
2010-10-13T13:53:47  <krokokrusa> i suspect some bots strategies don't work when the number of attacking ships is huge
2010-10-13T13:53:52  <krokokrusa> mine for sure :)
2010-10-13T13:54:11  <krokokrusa> not huge, but bigger than usual i'd say
2010-10-13T13:54:14  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-13T13:54:25  <bhasker> one thing that i have seen screws over my bot is
2010-10-13T13:54:34  <bhasker> if i lose a core planet to a large force
2010-10-13T13:54:39  <bhasker> its game over
2010-10-13T13:54:40  <rebelxt> Meatkat: rebelxt100 - it's a new buggy bot though ;-)
2010-10-13T13:54:44  <bhasker> they rapidly take over all the planets
2010-10-13T13:54:47  <bhasker> since most of my ships are upfront
2010-10-13T13:55:06  <rebelxt> err rebelxt110
2010-10-13T13:55:09  <bhasker> and the way my scoring function works i end up trying to defend my planets instead of trying to take his
2010-10-13T13:55:10  <krokokrusa> bhasker: true
2010-10-13T13:55:21  <bhasker> so my front planet starts sending ships back
2010-10-13T13:55:27  <krokokrusa> I hate it when huge fleet starts traveling through my planets :)
2010-10-13T13:55:30  <bhasker> instead of ahed into enemy territory:(
2010-10-13T13:55:49  <bhasker> this usually happens when enemy sends a huge fleet a a neutral near me
2010-10-13T13:55:52  <bhasker> and i just ignore it
2010-10-13T13:55:57  <bhasker> thinking it needs too many ships
2010-10-13T13:55:58  <bhasker> to acquire
2010-10-13T13:56:08  <bhasker> and then at X i have a huge fleet sitting outside my base
2010-10-13T13:56:19  <bhasker> so have to add some lookahead for neutrals with huge incoming fleets
2010-10-13T13:56:21  <bhasker> and counter them
2010-10-13T13:56:55  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=469847
2010-10-13T13:57:01  <bhasker> why o why do people do stuff like that
2010-10-13T13:57:44  <bhasker> though i won that because of a bug in my code ^
2010-10-13T13:58:02  <bhasker> well not a bug, basically my bot decided that none of the planets nearby were worth acquiring
2010-10-13T13:58:09  <bhasker> so it did nothing on turn 1
2010-10-13T13:58:17  <Zannick> er...he sent 33 ships to a planet with 59.
2010-10-13T13:58:26  <bhasker> some bots do that
2010-10-13T13:58:30  <bhasker> partial ships
2010-10-13T13:58:46  <Zannick> but then ignored it

2010-10-13T14:01:24  <rebelxt> on the topic of huge fleet traveling through your planets - i don't think it's worth hard-coding anything to prevent this. this can probably be addressed by a better scoring function which takes neighbor planets into account. it's tricky though :(
2010-10-13T14:01:39  <bhasker> bah loss to CCCF-ex9
2010-10-13T14:01:41  <rebelxt> hi, jetbot! ;-)
2010-10-13T14:01:45  <bhasker> by 1 ship
2010-10-13T14:01:46  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-13T14:02:11  <Meatkat> who is CCF-ex9? it's a very pretty bot whoever it is
2010-10-13T14:02:16  <Meatkat> CCCF*
2010-10-13T14:02:24  <bhasker> no idea who it is
2010-10-13T14:02:34  <rebelxt> bhasker: wow he attacked 14-neutral one turn ahead of you and won
2010-10-13T14:02:47  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-13T14:02:52  <bhasker> cause i ignore 1 growth planets on turn 1
2010-10-13T14:02:58  <rebelxt> CCCF is felixcoto (rumor not a fact)
2010-10-13T14:03:10  <bhasker> i decided after watching a bunch of games
2010-10-13T14:03:31  <rebelxt> even if it's 1-distance 1-ship 1-growth neutral?
2010-10-13T14:03:31  <Meatkat> oh sh*t, here comes jetbot!
2010-10-13T14:03:38  <bhasker> yea for now yes
2010-10-13T14:03:41  <bhasker> but i think i will change that
2010-10-13T14:04:02  <bhasker> mostly i wnat to ignore any 1 growth planets that require more than 4-5 ships to take
2010-10-13T14:04:11  <bhasker> i found that its generally not useful to burn more ships on a 1 growth
2010-10-13T14:04:15  <bhasker> on turn 1
2010-10-13T14:04:31  <cfaftw> lol

2010-10-13T14:34:46  <cfaftw> rebelxt, no, your bot is good
2010-10-13T14:35:15  <cfaftw> rebelxt, but i took down JetBot.2 and put up JetBot.1, which is my official submission bot with one bug fix that i know worked
2010-10-13T14:35:28  <cfaftw> JetBot.2 had a bunch of fixes that i thought would help, but apparently don't

2010-10-13T14:48:40  <cfaftw> my bot was winning, then he launched an attack... by turn 200 he was up by 40 ships
2010-10-13T14:48:56  <amstan_> janzert: you can ping him, but he's at work till like ~18:00

2010-10-13T15:19:41  <lavalamp> hello everyone
2010-10-13T15:19:47  <cfaftw> sup
2010-10-13T15:19:51  <JamesMG> hi
2010-10-13T15:20:09  <lavalamp> I'm trying to figure out if there's a way I can speed up getting the server to accept golang submissions....
2010-10-13T15:20:40  <lavalamp> I'm anxious to see how my bot (http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=pwwax.12) would do there...
2010-10-13T15:20:57  <lavalamp> Any ideas?
2010-10-13T15:22:19  <bss03> Got an issue open?
2010-10-13T15:22:48  <bss03> If not, open one.  If so: Got a patch written?
2010-10-13T15:23:12  <Zannick> the code for compiling Go has been there from the start...i think all that's left is having the go compiler on the servers and the entry in the database
2010-10-13T15:23:18  <lavalamp> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=44
2010-10-13T15:23:19  <bss03> If not, write one.  If so: Attached / Linked from issue?
2010-10-13T15:23:33  <lavalamp> I wrote a starter package
2010-10-13T15:23:50  <Zannick> no patch necessary, other than starter package (which is not required for support)
2010-10-13T15:24:02  <bss03> Hrm, the compile logic appears to be in place, according to the ticket.
2010-10-13T15:24:05  <janzert> Zannick: btw, I got the tournament_manager tested locally and put up a branch for review
2010-10-13T15:24:11  <lavalamp> Which is linked there and on the forum (http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=883)
2010-10-13T15:24:13  <Zannick> janzert: i saw
2010-10-13T15:24:19  <bss03> Have you tried submitting a Go-lang bot?
2010-10-13T15:24:29  <lavalamp> yes, it doesn't compile
2010-10-13T15:24:38  <lavalamp> At least it didn't yesterday
2010-10-13T15:24:47  <Zannick> i'll give it more attention tonight

2010-10-13T15:25:07  <lavalamp> The error message says it can't figure out what language
2010-10-13T15:25:10  <lavalamp> yeah
2010-10-13T15:25:12  <janzert> like Zannick said, while support is in the code, I don't think golang has been installed on the server
2010-10-13T15:25:18  <Zannick> i suspect that the entry isn't in the database
2010-10-13T15:25:32  <Zannick> and that might be because the server doesn't have it
2010-10-13T15:25:41  <lavalamp> I don't think that's something I can submit a patch for :)
2010-10-13T15:25:44  <janzert> actually I think amstan said the same thing on the forum and had actually checked the server
2010-10-13T15:25:46  <Zannick> it isn't :)
2010-10-13T15:26:20  <lavalamp> I emailed Jeff, as amstan suggested but no word back

2010-10-13T15:27:29  <bss03> Someone should update the issue, incidating that compile_anything has support, but that Go-lang isn't installed on the server.
2010-10-13T15:27:46  <lavalamp> Should I do that?

2010-10-13T16:54:21  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: the difference between ghc 6.12 and ghc 7 for my code should be around 10x though. it's that important in this case
2010-10-13T16:54:24  <bss03> Now, I average probably 500ms per turn, but there are some sideways cases where I take 3-5s on a turn and timeout locally.
2010-10-13T16:54:42  <bss03> I ran on the TCP server for 2 days with the same code and never timed out there, though. :P
2010-10-13T16:54:42  <jmcarthur> and between 6.8 and 6.12 is also a consideration...
2010-10-13T16:55:02  <McLeopold> I should get into haskell some time.
2010-10-13T16:55:31  <bss03> McLeopold: Two pretty good books about it, both available to read for free on the web.
2010-10-13T16:55:34  <McLeopold> I'd like to see how you do given multiple threads and 5 seconds a turn. :)
2010-10-13T16:55:42  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-10-13T16:55:54  <bss03> McLeopold: Learn You A Haskell (LYAH for short) and Real World Haskell (RWH for short).
2010-10-13T16:55:56  <jmcarthur> probably pretty well by comparison :)
2010-10-13T16:56:11  <jmcarthur> although right now i have stuck some code in that is not parallelism friendly
2010-10-13T16:56:16  <jmcarthur> i could fix it pretty easily though i think
2010-10-13T16:56:21  <rebelxt> bss03: tcp server has 10-sec time-out (unlike dhartmei adjusted it), so be careful
2010-10-13T16:56:25  <McLeopold> You should play your bot against itself with one given shorter time.  That would be interesting.
2010-10-13T16:57:08  <bss03> rebelxt: That might be why I didn't see it then, I thought the time-out was still like 1500ms on the TCP server.
2010-10-13T16:57:26  <rebelxt> bss03: no, it's 10 seconds - i just checked the source code
2010-10-13T16:57:39  <jmcarthur> 10... seconds...?
2010-10-13T16:58:09  <jmcarthur> it really is just for testing i guess :)
2010-10-13T16:58:10  <bss03> rebelxt: I'm pretty sure I can get the time down quite a bit though. I'm fairly sure I'm got a lambda that GHC 6.12 isn't floating...
2010-10-13T16:58:13  <rebelxt> jmcarthur: actually, sorry it's 5 seconds! was looking at a wrong line
2010-10-13T16:58:18  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-10-13T16:58:20  <jmcarthur> that's more reasonable
2010-10-13T16:58:55  <bss03> rebelxt: that I float manually fairly easily, and drop some redundant calculations on the way.
2010-10-13T16:59:36  <bss03> I just haven't gotten around to it.  Got a lot of ideas bouncing around that I haven't sat down to write in code.
2010-10-13T16:59:44  <jmcarthur> i personally think such optimizations should just be written by hand anyway. it's much more clear how your performance will be that way and reduces redundancies in your code
2010-10-13T17:00:07  <javagamer> I just realized my defense code would be nearly identical to my sniping code, I can just tweak it slightly and use the same code for both
2010-10-13T17:00:10  <jmcarthur> many such optimizations anyway
2010-10-13T17:00:12  <jmcarthur> not all
2010-10-13T17:00:39  <jmcarthur> javagamer: you know you should copy and paste
2010-10-13T17:00:44  <jmcarthur> javagamer: it doubles your productivity
2010-10-13T17:00:48  <bss03> I'm trying to let them congeal; I'm pretty sure implementing one of them correctly will make the others much easier.
2010-10-13T17:00:49  <javagamer> heh
2010-10-13T17:00:54  <jmcarthur> so much more code written in so much less time!

2010-10-13T17:02:14  <bss03> javagamer: I have separate functions for moving ships to the front line and fleeing planets I'm going to lose, but most of it is in one large function.
2010-10-13T17:02:15  <javagamer> bss03, I may end up with something like the eventually, but for now I'm pretty far from that
2010-10-13T17:02:32  <javagamer> bss03, you flee planets you'll lose?

2010-10-13T17:03:28  <bss03> javagamer: I think I'm going to move away from it (all one function) in some respects.  It's started to grow some special cases, so I need to refactor some stuff into smaller functions and re-build on that.
2010-10-13T17:03:32  <lavalamp> I have a function that decides how many ships I need where and when, and another one that figures out where to get them from
2010-10-13T17:03:58  <lavalamp> Well, the first one is multiple functions.
2010-10-13T17:04:13  <bss03> javagamer: If I'm behind in ship count, and the planet is going to fall this turn, and there's a planet I think I will hold by the time I can get to it, I flee.
2010-10-13T17:04:44  <bss03> javagamer: If I have 25 ships and they have 50 ships, it is very important I don't trade 20 ships 1-for-1.
2010-10-13T17:04:56  <javagamer> bss03, true, didn't consider that
2010-10-13T17:05:24  <javagamer> My code is primarily written for when I'm winning, it's not very good at turning around games yet
2010-10-13T17:05:27  <lavalamp> bss03: I think do that, too, but it's an unintended consequence...
2010-10-13T17:05:43  <bss03> javagamer: However, I do need to tweak that code to flee *less* that that even.
2010-10-13T17:05:57  <lavalamp> if my defense goal fails, it frees up all those ships to take something else...
2010-10-13T17:06:25  <bss03> javagamer: Cause the rest of my code doesn't take into account the fact that I flee, so it doesn't expect the large hostile troops there and doesn't "win back" the planet the way it should.
2010-10-13T17:07:05  <bss03> So, I'm thinking only flee if I don't have fleets headed toward that planet.
2010-10-13T17:08:05  <lavalamp> If you're going to lose it anyway, you might as well flee. You can't get the ships you sent towards the doomed planet back.
2010-10-13T17:09:19  <lavalamp> My problem is that my fleeing ships like to attack neutral planets... >.<
2010-10-13T17:09:21  <bss03> lavalamp: Well, depends.  Say they are about to hit my growth 3 planet with 24 ships, and I have 20 there right now, but 13 arriving in a couple of turns.
2010-10-13T17:09:51  <lavalamp> bss03: ah, good point, if you can retake it you shouldn't flee, true
2010-10-13T17:10:00  <bss03> lavalamp: If I keep my ships there, I'll retake the planet.  If I flee, I'll lose those 13, plus I'll lose some growth.

2010-10-13T17:17:52  <lavalamp> jmcarthur: Yeah, more specifically I list a bunch of goals. I turn the goals into "sinks" (x ships should be at planet y at turn z). Then I fulfill as many sinks as I can, starting with the highest priority goal.
2010-10-13T17:18:09  <bss03> jmcarthur: But, it is hanging on to 120th on the official server, last I checked.
2010-10-13T17:18:15  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: ah, mine is different from that
2010-10-13T17:18:40  <bss03> lavalamp: That's sort of similar to mine.
2010-10-13T17:18:53  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: i determine *exactly* how many ships i want at each planet, but not exactly how soon, then i try to figure out the quickest way to make it so (fewest number of turns)
2010-10-13T17:19:53  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: or, rather, i determine how many ships i want *heading toward* each planet, not even really how many i want there on a particular turn
2010-10-13T17:19:56  <lavalamp> That might be better, I had a bug where attacks were failing because the goal setting code was calculating the distance from the wrong planet
2010-10-13T17:19:59  <rebelxt> bss03: did you open source your bot?
2010-10-13T17:20:35  <lavalamp> bss03: I'll take a look, maybe I'll learn something about Haskell
2010-10-13T17:21:00  <bss03> lavalamp: I calculate for each time t (0 <= t <= 28 or so), for each planet, how many ships to send to take it, reward for taking it.  Sort by reward, send "available" ships, to each one in order, if I have enough available ships.
2010-10-13T17:21:19  <bss03> rebelxt: Yes, it is LGPL.  Has been since day -1.

2010-10-13T17:23:12  <bss03> jmcarthur: My *Orders function are all local so they can use the "distances" map.
2010-10-13T17:23:19  <jmcarthur> but that's also *not* counting the numerous libraries i'm using too
2010-10-13T17:23:29  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-10-13T17:23:37  <jmcarthur> bss03: oh so *that's* how you're avoiding passing state :P
2010-10-13T17:24:05  <bss03> rebelxt: I read it, but I don't think it'll be quite an issue with my bot.  Mainly because I'm writing in Haskell.
2010-10-13T17:24:19  <jmcarthur> bss03: hey, you could use implicit parameters for your distances if you don't want to do a reader monad
2010-10-13T17:25:17  <bss03> jmcarthur: Well, the "distances" map is still recalculated each time doTurn is executed, so I don't actually save the state between turns.
2010-10-13T17:25:18  <jmcarthur> doesn't clear up your type signatures, but it keeps your implementation code simpler at least
2010-10-13T17:25:23  <jmcarthur> ah

2010-10-13T17:46:33  <lavalamp> Some maps are obviously draws (home worlds too close, neutrals too expensive or far)
2010-10-13T17:46:53  <McLeopold> I'd like to work with dmj111 on better ways people can test bots against good ones without giving up source code.
2010-10-13T17:46:54  <lavalamp> bss03: that's pretty cool
2010-10-13T17:47:16  <JamesMG> McLeopold: If you guys need hosting for that when it's ready let me know
2010-10-13T17:47:32  <lavalamp> I'd be interested in a binary exchange, maybe, definitely if there were some easy way to run them in a sandbox
2010-10-13T17:47:32  <McLeopold> JamesMG: great, I'll keep you in mind.
2010-10-13T17:47:36  <bss03> *shrug* I believe in development in the open.
2010-10-13T17:47:42  <McLeopold> JamesMG: what kinda of server can you offer?
2010-10-13T17:47:55  <JamesMG> I was thinking of just paying for an ec2 instance
2010-10-13T17:48:01  <bss03> A rising tide lifts all boats is fine with me.
2010-10-13T17:48:29  <JamesMG> unless it has to run all the binaries itself it should work
2010-10-13T17:48:31  <McLeopold> It would be nice if people could submit a bot to a server, and then others could request to play it.

2010-10-13T17:51:34  <rebelxt> bss03, appreciate your readyness to take it down. it's a good idea not to open source full bot code until Nov 27th
2010-10-13T17:51:58  <bss03> And, my code is rather... ugly... so they'd have to spend some time getting familiar with it before they could usefullly modify it.

2010-10-13T17:58:11  <rebelxt> bss03, http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=886 . problem is that other people will get pissed when someone re-submits your code having changed one line. then someone who is in 200th spot feels like they have to fight copies of your bot
2010-10-13T17:58:16  <bss03> amstan / amstan_ : What's your opinion on my open-source bot?  Should I (try to) take down the code until Nov. 27?
2010-10-13T17:59:17  <bss03> RebelXT: I read the thread.  "A rasing tide make all ships float" isn't a problem IMO.
2010-10-13T17:59:19  <McLeopold> Entries which are deemed to violate the spirit of fair and sportsmanlike competition will be disqualified
2010-10-13T17:59:35  <rebelxt> bss03: imagine your bot is top10 in a week, and still open source...
2010-10-13T17:59:45  <McLeopold> You may be enabling unsportsmanlike competition, but it's a very gray area.
2010-10-13T18:00:04  <bss03> McLeopold: I don't see how releasing my code is at all unfair or unsportsmanlike.
2010-10-13T18:00:18  <rebelxt> "Entries which are deemed to violate the spirit of fair and sportsmanlike competition will be disqualified" -- this is not going to be enforced. we just have to trust people don't cheat
2010-10-13T18:00:25  <bss03> McLeopold: It's fair because everyone gets the same rights to it.
2010-10-13T18:00:29  <McLeopold> Not you being unsportsman, but helping other to be
2010-10-13T18:01:03  <contestbot> Top 10 players: rsergio(4012), Hazard(3832), felixcoto(3811), dmj111(3791), davidjliu(3727), MariusCG(3711), ruilov(3697), asavis(3687), savchenko(3673), sequoh(3668)
2010-10-13T18:01:47  <McLeopold> I think sharing your ideas as pseudo code is great, just not the actual code.  And again, it's a grey area.

2010-10-13T18:02:36  <Zannick> hahaha
2010-10-13T18:03:03  <McLeopold> It's kinda like giving away money to people while playing monopoly.  Sure, you can be fair about it, but it's just ruins the game.
2010-10-13T18:03:23  <rebelxt> completely agreed with McLeopold. sharing utilities code is probably fine too. just not the "core" algorithm
2010-10-13T18:04:06  <McLeopold> bss03: and I'd like amstan's opinion as well...
2010-10-13T18:04:10  <rebelxt> bss03, i share your passion for open source too btw! it really drives innovation
2010-10-13T18:04:31  <McLeopold> I'm totally going open-source after Nov.
2010-10-13T18:04:53  <JamesMG> I'm going to like reading some of these after the 27th
2010-10-13T18:06:02  <rebelxt> JamesMG: can't wait too. hope everyone comments their code ;-)
2010-10-13T18:06:09  <McLeopold> bss03: also, the competition is more than just who wins the whole thing.  There may be local or group competitions that you might affect.
2010-10-13T18:06:27  <McLeopold> Like, who's the best bot at a university or something.
2010-10-13T18:07:13  <bss03> rebelxt: Just think of my code as one big library then. :P

2010-10-13T18:11:27  <jmcarthur> i just mean given any amount of time, can a simple but non-trivial map be solved quickly enough to perhaps generate a game plan to test your real bot against
2010-10-13T18:11:32  <rebelxt> bss03: then you should change your account to an "open source team" and compete in a different division ;-)
2010-10-13T18:11:44  <sigh> jmcarthur: you might want to ask antimatroid about that, he's really into game theory and is/wants to investigate that sort of thing
2010-10-13T18:11:48  <jmcarthur> like have a bot to play against, just for testing your real bot, that has "beaten" the map already
2010-10-13T18:12:01  <bss03> RebelXT: That's the beauty of open-source, *everyone* has the same base.
2010-10-13T18:12:20  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: yes, most of my test maps are designed that way
2010-10-13T18:12:26  <jmcarthur> bss03: and that's precisely the downside in this case
2010-10-13T18:12:27  <McLeopold> But, by hand.
2010-10-13T18:13:29  <bss03> jmcarthur: I don't see it as a downside.
2010-10-13T18:13:58  <rebelxt> bss03, yeah like i said i love open source. it's the main innovation driver in software
2010-10-13T18:13:59  <jmcarthur> bss03: you don't see it as a downside that everybody could instantly be at place 40 with no work and then have to beat that just to get above average?
2010-10-13T18:14:23  <bss03> jmcarthur: Everyone has access to the code of Gnome, KDE, and XFCE, but there's still dozens of different window managers with their own user base.
2010-10-13T18:14:44  <bss03> Just because there's an open-source bot, doesn't mean all or even many of the entires must be basaed on it.
2010-10-13T18:14:44  <jmcarthur> bss03: but gnome, kde, and xfce are not competing in an ai contest
2010-10-13T18:14:46  <McLeopold> XWindows is not a competition with a deadline.
2010-10-13T18:15:20  <bss03> jmcarthur: Since when has raising the bar for competition been bad?
2010-10-13T18:15:55  <McLeopold> raising the bar should mean writing a better bot, not giving away source code to everyone
2010-10-13T18:15:55  <bss03> If you can't beat code I'm willing to give to anyone, so you really be placed above average in the competition?
2010-10-13T18:15:58  <rebelxt> bss03: let's clarify with organizers and have them make decision on this and update the rules section on the web site
2010-10-13T18:16:08  <bss03> Yeah, I agree.
2010-10-13T18:16:13  <jmcarthur> bss03: raising the bar is fine. giving everybody a trampoline isn't, because then everybody has to learn how to beat a trampoline

2010-10-13T18:17:57  <jmcarthur> i kind of see an open source bot like i would see a poker player showing his hands while he plays and talking about why he is making particular decisions openly for all spectators to hear
2010-10-13T18:18:02  <Zannick> "Should I open-source my bot while the tournament is ongoing?" etc.

2010-10-13T18:18:44  <jmcarthur> not a problem, per se, but it does mean that all the other poker players have to be at least that good now
2010-10-13T18:18:48  <Zannick> well...i would say more that he's doing that during the tournament, but not actually while playing

2010-10-13T18:56:05  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-13T18:56:09  <McLeopold> To me, it seems to violate good sportsmanship.
2010-10-13T18:56:14  <amstan_> i'm not sure, this should be on a case by case basis
2010-10-13T18:56:14  <Zannick> oh, so you did get it to compile?
2010-10-13T18:56:36  <mager> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException at Engine.main<Engine.java:139>
2010-10-13T18:56:38  <amstan_> by sportmanship we mostly meant don't deprive other bots of cpu power
2010-10-13T18:56:56  <amstan_> using other people's code is fine
2010-10-13T18:57:02  <amstan_> it was in the RPS one
2010-10-13T18:57:08  <McLeopold> RPS?
2010-10-13T18:57:16  <amstan_> rock paper scissors
2010-10-13T18:57:38  <mager> Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException : 1 at ViewerPanel.run<ViewerPanel.java:85> at java.lang.Thread.run<unknown Source>
2010-10-13T18:57:49  <McLeopold> So, if I made it to the #1 spot, then released by code so everyone could use it, you'd be okay with that?
2010-10-13T18:58:11  <McLeopold> Released in such a form that everyone could submit it as is.
2010-10-13T18:58:13  <amstan_> well
2010-10-13T18:58:22  <amstan_> you'd only doing harm to yourself
2010-10-13T18:58:35  <mager> true facts
2010-10-13T18:58:41  <McLeopold> I would argue I'd harm the whole competition.
2010-10-13T18:58:44  <amstan_> it does deprive noobs of the learning opportunity, but this is a contest
2010-10-13T18:58:46  <amstan_> not a classroom
2010-10-13T18:59:00  <amstan_> McLeopold: not really, how?
2010-10-13T18:59:01  <Zannick> so if i made it to the #1 spot, then released older code that looks right but actually doesn't quite work...
2010-10-13T18:59:02  <rebelxt> amstan_: no, this breaks the whole competition imho
2010-10-13T18:59:02  <bhasker> a contest where you cheat and win?
2010-10-13T18:59:27  <McLeopold> What about the rule that you can't have control of more than one account, but multiple people must join as a team?
2010-10-13T18:59:28  <mager> could someone kindly tell me w hat those runtime errors mean :)
2010-10-13T18:59:36  <bhasker> personally i think more than winning the competition its the learning experience that matters for me
2010-10-13T18:59:41  <McLeopold> If there is an open-source effort, how do you police that?
2010-10-13T18:59:50  <amstan_> McLeopold: that's for protecting ranks, so you can't artifically boost them
2010-10-13T18:59:57  <Zannick> yeah, next competition let's have a game where the bots have to cheat to win
2010-10-13T19:00:11  <Zannick> mager: so, "player 2 crashed" means there was a problem running the bot
2010-10-13T19:00:23  <Zannick> what happens when you run MyBot.exe from the command line?
2010-10-13T19:00:38  <mager> yes - but its the default bot that came with the starter package
2010-10-13T19:00:40  <McLeopold> So, your only concern is for bots to play fairly, not people?
2010-10-13T19:00:46  <mager> it just sits at a blank black cmd prompt
2010-10-13T19:01:00  <Zannick> okay, type "go" and hit enter
2010-10-13T19:01:04  <contestbot> Top 10 players: rsergio(3992), Hazard(3807), felixcoto(3791), dmj111(3772), davidjliu(3705), MariusCG(3683), ruilov(3679), asavis(3666), savchenko(3663), sequoh(3648)
2010-10-13T19:01:06  <amstan_> McLeopold: it's just impossible to police such things
2010-10-13T19:01:17  <Zannick> if it says "go" back to you, it's working
2010-10-13T19:01:25  <mager> it repeated 'go' to me
2010-10-13T19:01:27  <McLeopold> Yes, but you could have an official position on the matter even if you don't enforce it.
2010-10-13T19:01:30  <amstan_> so instead of giving reasons for them to try to avoid them and potentially break even more important rules, we should just allow them
2010-10-13T19:01:31  <bss03> amstan_ : I had my bot on GitHub, LGPL license.  I had a few requests to take it down.  A few people thought having my bot available was unfair or was encouraging unsportsmanlike conduct in others.
2010-10-13T19:01:33  <Zannick> okay, good
2010-10-13T19:01:46  <mager> so if it works...why doesn't it work lol :P
2010-10-13T19:01:52  <amstan_> bss03: let them complain them
2010-10-13T19:01:54  <Zannick> so the problem is probably with the command you gave the PlayGame.jar
2010-10-13T19:02:00  <amstan_> i don't think we can ban people for giving their code away
2010-10-13T19:02:25  <McLeopold> No, but you could discourage it.  But if official word is it's okay...
2010-10-13T19:02:33  <McLeopold> ...Ouch.
2010-10-13T19:02:44  <amstan_> i don't see the point of such things though
2010-10-13T19:02:54  <bhasker> hah finally

2010-10-13T19:03:28  <amstan_> don't make it a rule, but strongly frown upon? idk
2010-10-13T19:03:28  <rebelxt> amstan_: right, no need to ban or police anyone. an official statement on code sharing would be helpful though
2010-10-13T19:03:28  <mager> i copied the command from the 5 minute quick tutorial
2010-10-13T19:03:31  <McLeopold> Would you be willing to make that more clear in the rules section, that open-source and code sharing is allowed?
2010-10-13T19:03:39  <bss03> amstan_: I just wanted some official input as to whether it was okay; I don't want to be skirting the rules.
2010-10-13T19:03:51  <bhasker> mcleopold check that game out:D
2010-10-13T19:03:55  <amstan_> so... if there's such concerns i guess it would be nice to give other users the learning opportunity of making the bot from scratch
2010-10-13T19:04:02  <amstan_> but we cannot make it a rule, it's impossible to enforce
2010-10-13T19:04:03  <bhasker> i finally managed to beat CCCF:D
2010-10-13T19:04:19  <amstan_> bss03: you are not against the rules.. afaik
2010-10-13T19:04:27  <bss03> amstan_: I have a request (not a requirement) in the LICENSE that they not submit the bot unmodified, but it really was there so anyone (that honors the LGPL) could build upon it.
2010-10-13T19:04:48  <amstan_> sure
2010-10-13T19:04:57  <amstan_> so... it's the same as reading a book
2010-10-13T19:05:18  <amstan_> you try to include spoiler alerts everywhere
2010-10-13T19:05:24  <McLeopold> amstan_: I'd like to see the competition be, "write the best bot", not "tweak the best bot", but that is my opinion.
2010-10-13T19:05:51  <amstan_> it's write the best bot with whatever resources you can find
2010-10-13T19:05:54  <McLeopold> amstan_: and you're right, it's unenforable.
2010-10-13T19:06:00  <bss03> Well, if they modfied it, they'd have to use the GPL or LGPL for their bot so I could use their code as well. ;)
2010-10-13T19:06:14  <amstan_> bss03: not really
2010-10-13T19:06:21  <rebelxt> amstan_, can you guys discuss this issue among organizers before you make a decision? we had a lengthy discussion here, and also on the forums - http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=886 on this topic.
2010-10-13T19:06:24  <amstan_> bss03: for that you need to make it gpl affero
2010-10-13T19:06:33  <amstan_> bss03: they're not obligated to send you the source, nor the binary
2010-10-13T19:06:43  <bss03> amstan_: Yes really; uploading it to the competition is distribution.

2010-10-13T19:07:18  <amstan_> bss03: you only have to give the source to the people that also have the binary
2010-10-13T19:07:32  <amstan_> bss03: since nobody has the binary, nobody gets the source either
2010-10-13T19:07:33  <bss03> amstan_: True 'nuf.
2010-10-13T19:07:35  <rebelxt> amstan_, i'm strongly with McLeopold on this - let people share binaries and libraries (utility code, starter packs) but draw a line somewhere to disallow mindless bot tweaking. just my $0.02 of course
2010-10-13T19:08:00  <amstan_> rebelxt: so.. idk, i actually did this in RPS, that's how i won it
2010-10-13T19:08:06  <amstan_> you might boo me all you want
2010-10-13T19:08:25  <amstan_> i just took a previously made up bot with some extra 50 lines of code.
2010-10-13T19:08:38  <amstan_> for detecting if others were also this epic bot
2010-10-13T19:08:50  <amstan_> i ran 2 instances of it
2010-10-13T19:09:41  <McLeopold> bhasker: why is that game interesting?
2010-10-13T19:09:55  <bhasker> :D cause i managed to beat CCCF never done that before !
2010-10-13T19:10:15  <bss03> Well, I'm gonna leave the code down for now and mull it over.  I like developing in the open, and if more people send up being able to read/write some Haskell, I'll count that as a win...
2010-10-13T19:10:30  <bss03> ...even if I lose to a slightly tweaked version of my bot.
2010-10-13T19:11:17  <rebelxt> amstan_, no worries - i'm not here to boo anyone. i'm here to have fun.. i was just expressing my personal opinion.. i have 5 co-workers in the same office with me, all of us actively participating in the contest. all 5 think open sourcing top bots until Nov 27th is a a move which will hurt/break the competition
2010-10-13T19:12:08  <amstan_> well.. who do you think will be negatively affected if you do this?
2010-10-13T19:12:23  <bss03> I wouldn't call my top a "Top Bot" anymore;  is top has been getting tougher and my bot hasn't really gotten much better is a few weeks.

2010-10-13T19:13:31  <amstan_> bss03: what language is it?
2010-10-13T19:13:34  <McLeopold> amstan_: everyone bss03 can beat now?
2010-10-13T19:13:48  <bss03> amstan_: My bot?  Haskell.
2010-10-13T19:13:58  <amstan_> McLeopold: so.. you're worried about person B, that's at the same rank as person A
2010-10-13T19:14:07  <amstan_> but person A copied the bot from bss03?
2010-10-13T19:14:25  <McLeopold> yes
2010-10-13T19:14:51  <amstan_> but person B has the same opportunity to copy bss03
2010-10-13T19:15:42  <McLeopold> true, but right now, some people think that is unfair.  So an official word from the officials would help clear it up.
2010-10-13T19:16:08  <McLeopold> That way everyone has the same expectations of what is considered fair.
2010-10-13T19:16:19  <rebelxt> amstan_: well, i'm in 20 place overall, and there are 712 other python submissions. so i flip a switch and open source my bot. 200 "cheaters" take my code and submit it as theirs. 200 cheaters fly on the leaderboard and crush the competition.. people affected are those who want to keep working on their bot using their own ideas and code
2010-10-13T19:17:10  <rebelxt> amstan_, that's the point, tons of people don't feel like having to copy someone else's code or algorithm just to stay competetive
2010-10-13T19:17:13  <McLeopold> The sportsmanship rule does not make it clear that it applies to bots and not people.

2010-10-13T19:19:00  <sigh> "people affected are those who want to keep working on their bot using their own ideas and code" << this is also an argument against sharing strategies
2010-10-13T19:19:47  <Zannick> i will share my strategies only when i have determined they are insufficient to put me in the top n.
2010-10-13T19:19:52  <Zannick> for small n
2010-10-13T19:20:04  <McLeopold> Also, the rule about only one account should have some clarification as well.  You have a collaborative open-source effort, you a effectively putting code in someone else's submition.
2010-10-13T19:21:05  <rebelxt> sigh: well, kind of, but lots of room for idea sharing - i pretty much listed most of my heuristics on the forums at a high level.. http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=856
2010-10-13T19:21:45  <McLeopold> amstan_ must be rewriting bss03's entry and submitting it right now...

2010-10-13T19:24:46  <sigh> I'm just saying a lot of arguments about this are not black and white... it seems ultimately that people just find it intrinsically unfair that someone would get a higher ranking with little/no work. This is not a bad sentiment, jut that they try to rationalise with (I find) arguments that are encompass a lot more than they intend
2010-10-13T19:27:23  <sigh> It appears the biggest impact of releasing a top bot will be people' perceptions of the tournament, and people's motivations. This in
2010-10-13T19:28:04  <sigh> (Ignore the "This in")
2010-10-13T19:28:33  <Meatkat> Did someone else post source code to a top bot? or are we talking about the one that was already posted and removed?

2010-10-13T19:41:40  <mager> its been about a minute and the visualizer still isn't popping up : (
2010-10-13T19:41:58  <Zannick> the worker=0 comments are probably due to it being the only one most of the time
2010-10-13T19:42:05  <mager> i assume it takes longer when its 648 turns long of a battle.
2010-10-13T19:42:12  <Zannick> oh, yeah.
2010-10-13T19:42:19  <mager> : (
2010-10-13T19:42:34  <janzert> well worker=0 is the main server and I think is using different code in many places than the other servers
2010-10-13T19:42:37  <Zannick> change the second 1000 to 200.
2010-10-13T19:42:46  <janzert> so not too surprising it has different bugs
2010-10-13T19:43:52  <janzert> for instance I'm pretty sure the main server is not recording errors still
2010-10-13T19:45:02  <Zannick> that was what i was thinking wrt those errors
2010-10-13T19:45:40  * janzert nods
2010-10-13T19:47:23  <janzert> the two emails thing, I have to wonder if he tried uploading and when it was taking to long refreshed the page and caused it to upload a second time
2010-10-13T19:47:41  <janzert> so even though he thought it was only one submission it ended up being two
2010-10-13T19:47:56  <janzert> doesn't explain why the first one failed though of course
2010-10-13T19:48:06  <Zannick> it would explain that, maybe
2010-10-13T19:48:33  <Zannick> if it tried to start compiling a source file, failed quietly because the other thread was compiling it...
2010-10-13T19:48:38  <janzert> be nice to know what profile it was so you could see if it was two submission ids
2010-10-13T19:48:47  <Zannick> yeah, that doesn't make enough sense since each file is a separate comman
2010-10-13T19:48:49  <Zannick> command

2010-10-13T19:50:58  <Zannick> er, no, that's two different languages
2010-10-13T19:51:27  <janzert> yeah, that's kinda weird in itself
2010-10-13T19:51:36  <janzert> maybe accidental uploaded the wrong file
2010-10-13T19:52:02  <Zannick> then uploaded the correct one really fast, causing two threads to try to compile his latest submission
2010-10-13T19:52:13  <janzert> there is 9:44 9:45 but it says both compile fine
2010-10-13T19:52:58  * Zannick shrugs
2010-10-13T19:53:05  <janzert> I guess it doesn't really help :/
2010-10-13T19:53:48  <Zannick> definitely need to guard against races better
2010-10-13T19:53:55  <janzert> well gotta run for a few hours
2010-10-13T19:54:11  <janzert> separate uploads should be getting different submission ids so no race
2010-10-13T19:54:22  <Zannick> well, the compile fix solved the problem with C not compiling :D http://ai-contest.com/language_profile.php?lang=C
2010-10-13T19:54:22  * janzert shrugs
2010-10-13T19:54:35  <janzert> yay
2010-10-13T19:54:44  <Zannick> only if they're using submission ids, and not user ids to retrieve the latest id
2010-10-13T19:56:32  <janzert> IIRC compile_daemon doesn't look at user ids at all does it?
2010-10-13T19:56:43  <janzert> been a while since I was digging in it though
2010-10-13T19:57:00  <Zannick> i'll look later
2010-10-13T19:57:07  * Zannick work for 1 more hour
2010-10-13T19:57:31  <janzert> yeah, actually I need to go finish off some work as well
2010-10-13T19:57:36  <janzert> cya later
2010-10-13T19:57:39  <Zannick> see ya

2010-10-13T21:21:26  <jmcarthur> depends on the idea
2010-10-13T21:21:47  <javagamer> jmcarthur, there are ideas that are easier to type up rather than write down?
2010-10-13T21:22:17  <javagamer> obviously minor changes aren't worth writing out if you can just change a few lines and fix something
2010-10-13T21:22:26  <jmcarthur> i think so yes
2010-10-13T21:22:31  <javagamer> But I find big things (like refactoring) are best planned out on paper
2010-10-13T21:22:45  <jmcarthur> i typically only resort to paper when the idea is very visual (in my head) already
2010-10-13T21:22:49  <javagamer> I'm pretty much completely rewriting how my bot thinks
2010-10-13T21:23:11  <javagamer> wow... did I just somehow type a bunch of names?
2010-10-13T21:23:15  <jmcarthur> i do a lot of graph algorithms on paper. also anything relating to geometry
2010-10-13T21:23:34  <jmcarthur> *a lot of things related to geometry
2010-10-13T21:23:45  <jmcarthur> but even then...
2010-10-13T21:23:55  <jmcarthur> it's usually just to work an example to test my idea, not to write the idea itself out
2010-10-13T21:24:05  <jmcarthur> sometimes it's to show my idea to somebody else
2010-10-13T21:24:21  <jmcarthur> it's rarely to help me actually come up with the idea itself
2010-10-13T21:24:46  <jmcarthur> do you normally write text or draw diagrams when you do this?
2010-10-13T21:25:26  <javagamer> atm I'm mostly writing text, I never write actual code on paper
2010-10-13T21:25:35  <jmcarthur> well sure
2010-10-13T21:25:48  <jmcarthur> i do write math equations on paper sometimes, actually
2010-10-13T21:26:15  <javagamer> I agree it's very useful to test out an idea, but I also use it for general planning
2010-10-13T21:26:18  <jmcarthur> sometimes even in a pseudocode... but it's not really what most people would call pseudocode
2010-10-13T21:26:50  <jmcarthur> i tend to write more type signatures than code
2010-10-13T21:26:58  <javagamer> occasionally I'll have some pseudocode, but that's not too often
2010-10-13T21:35:06  <sigh> javagamer: I have a notebook which I take with me on the train to work to jot ideas down on
2010-10-13T21:35:09  <sigh> it helps a lot
2010-10-13T21:36:27  <sigh> most of my planning is done then :)
2010-10-13T21:37:46  <Azrathud> Heh. At first I was thinking you were talking about a notebook laptop.

2010-10-13T21:45:06  <jmcarthur> he never erased
2010-10-13T21:45:25  <jmcarthur> he would take the time to make sure he never made a mistake when writing, basically
2010-10-13T21:45:43  <jmcarthur> he never started writing without knowing exactly what he was going to write and without knowing that it was correct
2010-10-13T21:46:00  <sigh> haha, I'm nothing like that
2010-10-13T21:46:03  <jmcarthur> :P
2010-10-13T21:46:06  <sigh> I just like a record of my mistakes :P
2010-10-13T21:46:19  <sigh> when I was in uni I used pencil for assignments and exams so I could correct myself
2010-10-13T21:46:36  <sigh> but stuff like this is different
2010-10-13T21:50:49  <javagamer> It sounds like he's missing (at least part of) the point of writing stuff down if he always knows exactly what he's going to write beforehand
2010-10-13T21:51:29  <javagamer> This writing is really helping me brainstorm, I just got a bunch of new ideas and I think that a lot of behaviors I was specifically coding in will become emergent with my new idea
2010-10-13T21:52:04  <jmcarthur> javagamer: he wrote to remember later or to explain to others, not to sketch out and idea and see if it works

2010-10-13T21:53:13  <javagamer> I get that, I'm just saying sketching out ideas can be really useful, but I guess it really can vary from person to person
2010-10-13T21:53:51  <javagamer> I much prefer not to have physical documents, but I can plan so much better this way, so whenever I resort to paper I can tell I'm really involved in something
2010-10-13T21:54:06  <jmcarthur> yeah i don't really work that way
2010-10-13T21:54:23  <jmcarthur> on the other hand, i'm not like dijkstra either
2010-10-13T21:54:48  <jmcarthur> i can't just not write or type things out before i have completed the idea, that is
2010-10-13T21:55:18  <jmcarthur> but the act of writing isn't to help with my idea, it's so i can get parts of it out of my head to recall later while i think about other parts in the meantime
2010-10-13T21:56:24  <dmj111> i have about 20 pages in a cheap notebook filled with scratch notes on bot ideas.
2010-10-13T21:56:31  <dmj111> lots of whitespace :)
2010-10-13T21:56:46  <jmcarthur> i have a single page on it
2010-10-13T21:56:50  <jmcarthur> very dense
2010-10-13T21:57:09  <jmcarthur> it was only for a single algorithm i was coming up with though, and that because i was going through it with my wife
2010-10-13T21:57:17  <dmj111> cool.
2010-10-13T21:59:12  <javagamer> Whenever I just want to remember something I just type it up, the only benefit I really see in handwriting something is to brainstorm

2010-10-13T22:05:37  <sigh> yeah, hate when that happens
2010-10-13T22:08:38  <rebelxt_> sigh: it's pretty interesting. my bot uses it's own strategy to figure out most likely enemy's response to its actions. if i relax this assumption, my bot does better overall... great!
2010-10-13T22:09:32  <sigh> yeah, I haven't gotten around to implementing that yet because I was worried the same thing would happen to me
2010-10-13T22:10:19  <sigh> are you doing some sort of heavily pruned minimax?
2010-10-13T22:10:36  <sigh> or else, how are you using the enemie's predicted moves?
2010-10-13T22:12:08  <sigh> dunno how I thought "enemie's" was a valid thing to type
2010-10-13T22:12:20  <dmj111> rebelxt_: i was wondering about that ... but haven't tried it yet.
2010-10-13T22:12:58  <rebelxt_> yeah, using the same scoring function to predict enemies next move.. but it's not working out well at all so far
2010-10-13T22:13:47  <dmj111> my old bot is best when the enemy makes mistakes, so I was thinking of using _its_ logic instead of the new logic for that part.
2010-10-13T22:14:01  <dmj111> s/is best/is at its best/
2010-10-13T22:14:17  <rebelxt_> maybe it's a bug, i'm not sure yet
2010-10-13T22:15:38  <rebelxt_> dmj111 and sigh, you guys are both doing better than i am at the moment, so maybe i'm not moving in the right direction
2010-10-13T22:16:07  <sigh> honestly, I've just gotten lucky with my heuristics
2010-10-13T22:16:26  <sigh> I've been veyr lazy with implementing more sophisticated algorithms
2010-10-13T22:17:49  <rebelxt_> sigh: in my case heuristics still beat the crap out of more advanced calculations ;-)
2010-10-13T22:18:16  <dmj111> my guesses on heuristics have been lucky.  i have had to work through plenty of bugs, though, that originally led me astray from the main ideas.
2010-10-13T22:19:33  <rebelxt_> dmj111: you are doing very well! i spent good amount of time trying to reverse engineer some of your heuristics ;-)
2010-10-13T22:20:25  <sigh> yeah, when I started I thought I had a handle on this game because I got near the top very quickly... got knocked off my pedestal when "obvious" improvements kept failing and my bot kept dropping
2010-10-13T22:20:37  <dmj111> ahhh... thanks.  i changed one recently, that seems like it _should_ be better, and am getting wallopped.
2010-10-13T22:21:41  <rebelxt_> do any of you guys have galcon 1vs1 experience?
2010-10-13T22:21:48  <dmj111> ignoring rage bot has made my code easier, and it appears to give other people some joy too.
2010-10-13T22:21:52  <sigh> never played galcon :P

2010-10-13T22:35:22  <dmj111> that sounds good to me.  My logging is on there too... so i am not sure how much difference that makes.
2010-10-13T22:35:34  <rebelxt_> sigh: hope you have better luck than my first attempt at this
2010-10-13T22:36:07  <sigh> yeah, I'm so hesitant because I *know* that I'm gonna come across a lot of dead ends
2010-10-13T22:36:27  <sigh> so far waiting has paid off, because I hear about all the mistakes that others have made :)
2010-10-13T22:37:13  <rebelxt_> haha
2010-10-13T22:38:04  <sigh> honest, I'm most interested in what McLeopold comes up with
2010-10-13T22:38:10  <sigh> he has some really interesting ideas
2010-10-13T22:38:33  <sigh> and his bot in the main contest is a month old and still at 21
2010-10-13T22:38:39  <rebelxt_> yeah his current bot is Sep 16th, so he must have made good progress
2010-10-13T22:39:09  <sigh> s/honest/honestly

2010-10-13T22:42:34  <rebelxt_> wow, my recent bot is right next to his month-old bot... /scared of his new bot
2010-10-13T22:45:39  *** deepblue <deepblue!d8dcde83@gateway/web/freenode/ip.216.220.222.131> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-13T22:46:30  <rebelxt_> simulating the future is so version 1.0. i'm going to try simulating the past! ;-)
2010-10-13T22:47:16  <sigh> If you can do that with a stateless bot, count me impressed
2010-10-13T22:47:45  <deepblue> mine so far is stateless
2010-10-13T22:47:53  <deepblue> i don't care about past :)
2010-10-13T22:48:03  <sigh> mine too, stateless is easier to manage and test
2010-10-13T22:48:29  <deepblue> i agree
2010-10-13T22:48:32  <deepblue> and I see no point
2010-10-13T22:48:42  <deepblue> all important information is in the current state of the game
2010-10-13T22:49:03  <rebelxt_> same. i was just joking since i ran out of easy to implement ideas
2010-10-13T22:49:32  <sigh> well, opponent behavior matters, especially this isn't a game with perfect information
2010-10-13T22:49:41  <Error323> yes it is
2010-10-13T22:49:46  <Error323> ?
2010-10-13T22:50:02  <Error323> how is this not with perfect information?
2010-10-13T22:50:02  <sigh> ok, don't know the correct term, but you don't know your opponent's current move
2010-10-13T22:50:11  <sigh> unlike a turn based game
2010-10-13T22:50:25  <sigh> so you can't find a specific optimal move
2010-10-13T22:50:56  <deepblue> would be boring otherwise :)
2010-10-13T22:51:20  <sigh> plenty of interesting games where turns alternate :P
2010-10-13T22:51:47  <rebelxt_> sigh, exactly, my current bot reverses game's state and uses it's own algorithm to calculate opponent's current move.. then uses this to optimize my own current move. not working as expected though
2010-10-13T22:51:52  <deepblue> i mean this game :)
2010-10-13T22:52:20  <deepblue> that's quite an elaborate plan
2010-10-13T22:52:29  <deepblue> not sure if it's worth
2010-10-13T22:52:51  <deepblue> sounds like one deviation from its normal behaviour that the opponent does leads to misery ;)
2010-10-13T22:53:26  <rebelxt_> deepblue: unless i have a bug somewhere, it's much weaker than my previous bot which doesn't try to be smart
2010-10-13T22:53:45  <deepblue> i have the same problem
2010-10-13T22:53:56  <deepblue> my new ideas have a hard time beating my old versions
2010-10-13T22:54:44  <rebelxt_> i'm kinda glad to hear this ;-)...
2010-10-13T22:55:52  <sigh> from hanging out here, you realise that everyone has the same problems
2010-10-13T22:56:13  <Error323> haha
2010-10-13T22:56:15  <Error323> indd
2010-10-13T22:56:48  <rebelxt_> right, but breakthroughs do happen periodically
2010-10-13T22:57:10  <Error323> btw about the perfect information
2010-10-13T22:57:24  <Error323> couldn't you argue that you don't know the opponent's next move?
2010-10-13T22:58:16  <sigh> the point is that when your opponent is making a move, he knows what your move was
2010-10-13T22:58:28  <sigh> sorry if perfect information is not the correct term
2010-10-13T22:58:28  <Error323> yes
2010-10-13T22:59:01  <Error323> well afaik its perfect info in that the game is fully observable
2010-10-13T22:59:22  <Error323> but the action space is insane
2010-10-13T22:59:24  <sigh> ok, easier way to put it... you don't know the exact state of the map when your orders take effect
2010-10-13T22:59:38  <sigh> because your opponent made a move simultaneously
2010-10-13T23:00:14  <Error323> indeed
2010-10-13T23:01:03  <janzert> just because turns happen simultaneously I don't think disqualifies from being a game of perfect information
2010-10-13T23:01:05  <contestbot> Top 10 players: rsergio(3895), felixcoto(3762), Hazard(3759), dmj111(3722), davidjliu(3687), MariusCG(3686), ruilov(3670), savchenko(3660), asavis(3624), sequoh(3612)
2010-10-13T23:01:28  <Error323> I'm basing my algorithm on that assumption :P
2010-10-13T23:02:40  <sigh> janzert: yeah, I'm not sure of the exact definition
2010-10-13T23:03:35  <sigh> "So for example, one may have complete information in the context of a Prisoner's Dilemma, but nonetheless this is a game of imperfect information since one does not know the action of the other player." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information
2010-10-13T23:03:57  <sigh> best line to support my stance that I could find
2010-10-13T23:03:58  <janzert> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information
2010-10-13T23:04:10  <janzert> :)
2010-10-13T23:04:23  <sigh> yeah, but that page doesn't clear up this issue
2010-10-13T23:04:39  <sigh> I would argue that "In game theory, a game is said to have perfect information if all players know all moves that have taken place" does not hold
2010-10-13T23:04:43  <Error323> "moves that have taken place"
2010-10-13T23:04:57  <janzert> have is past tense so it does
2010-10-13T23:05:12  <janzert> your move and opponent happen at same time so doesn't invalidate it
2010-10-13T23:05:17  <sigh> in that case, is the prisoner's dilemma a game of perfect information?
2010-10-13T23:05:28  <janzert> that would be my interpretation
2010-10-13T23:05:43  <janzert> hmm, ok
2010-10-13T23:06:30  <janzert> yeah, I guess when it's boiled down to that I would go the other way
2010-10-13T23:06:30  <deepblue> hehe
2010-10-13T23:06:38  <dmj111> sigh: i think that this would qualify as perfect information in game theory.  but, i also get your intent that it is _not_ alternating turns.
2010-10-13T23:06:40  <Error323> you can model it to be alternating moves, as long as the simulation runs after both players have made the move
2010-10-13T23:07:22  <sigh> Error323: if you model it as alternating then it is clearly not perfect information as the "second" player has information hidden from them
2010-10-13T23:07:24  <deepblue> it's much easier to write a bot for that
2010-10-13T23:07:58  <janzert> although prisoner's dilemna may not qualify because the game ends before you find out the other's move?
2010-10-13T23:08:27  <janzert> so is iterated prisoner's dilemna considered
2010-10-13T23:08:30  <sigh> janzert: iterated prisoner's dilemma then
2010-10-13T23:08:33  <sigh> :P
2010-10-13T23:08:34  <dmj111> just looked it up... the difference is simultaneous vs. sequential games.
2010-10-13T23:08:46  <Error323> sigh: not when you expose the first player's move after the second has made his move aswell
2010-10-13T23:09:22  <sigh> after the first player has made his move, then that becomes part of the game state
2010-10-13T23:09:40  <deepblue> we should include a gambling part in the game
2010-10-13T23:09:41  <rebelxt_> dmj111: ahh good point. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory#Simultaneous_and_sequential
2010-10-13T23:10:00  <deepblue> your bot learns about the opponents move as soon as he locks them in
2010-10-13T23:10:04  <deepblue> so you can gamble
2010-10-13T23:10:22  <sigh> ok, that page settles it
2010-10-13T23:10:26  <deepblue> finish early and be safe or wait until the opponent decides but risk to time out
2010-10-13T23:10:27  <deepblue> :D
2010-10-13T23:10:32  <sigh> this game is complete information but not perfect information
2010-10-13T23:10:43  <deepblue> yay
2010-10-13T23:10:46  <deepblue> everybody is right
2010-10-13T23:11:23  <rebelxt_> yep complete info
2010-10-13T23:13:00  <sigh> simultaneous games are fundamentally different from sequential games, so that there is *some* distinction between the type of information available
2010-10-13T23:13:09  <sigh> *so it makes sense

2010-10-13T23:16:55  <rebelxt_> bhasker: number of bots
2010-10-13T23:16:58  <dmj111> hi fives all around, wikipedia and three servers!
2010-10-13T23:17:06  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-10-13T23:17:30  <bhasker> my bot has been climbing like 4 elo ratins an hour or something
2010-10-13T23:17:31  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-13T23:17:38  <deepblue> i'll let mine run in a few minutes
2010-10-13T23:17:50  <rebelxt_> wondering if our discussion inspired cloud servers to start back up...
2010-10-13T23:18:24  <bhasker> oh hmm
2010-10-13T23:18:32  <bhasker> there are only 4 bots rated higher than mine running on tcp at this time
2010-10-13T23:19:45  <bhasker> people start up your bots
2010-10-13T23:19:53  <rebelxt_> i can start one of mine if you wan
2010-10-13T23:19:57  <rebelxt_> want*
2010-10-13T23:20:41  <dmj111> i started up one of mine
2010-10-13T23:21:07  <dmj111> on my single core machine... I have to run it when I am not around :)
2010-10-13T23:22:08  <deepblue> ok here you go
2010-10-13T23:22:10  <deepblue> mine is running too now
2010-10-13T23:22:18  <rebelxt_> ok i started my last official bot too
2010-10-13T23:22:34  <deepblue> (mine could be buggy)
2010-10-13T23:23:06  <rebelxt_> let's see whose is the buggiest bot.. wth
2010-10-13T23:23:50  <rebelxt_> dmj, gg
2010-10-13T23:24:48  <bhasker> hehe
2010-10-13T23:25:09  <bhasker> rebelxt that would be my bot
2010-10-13T23:25:40  <rebelxt_> bhasker: which one? oldman?
2010-10-13T23:25:51  <bhasker> no malazan
2010-10-13T23:26:16  <rebelxt_> ahh, i just played dmj, then oldman

2010-10-13T23:26:57  <dmj111> nice rebelxt :)  i really need to work on the bot instead of reading the chat channel.
2010-10-13T23:27:03  <bhasker> i just beat deepblue

2010-10-13T23:27:17  <deepblue> good job :)
2010-10-13T23:27:33  <dmj111> as a Dave, i always freak out a little at the "I'm sorry Dave" comments.
2010-10-13T23:27:41  <rebelxt_> dmj111: i tried improving my bot, and it's a dead end! ;-)
2010-10-13T23:27:45  <Zannick> dmj111: I'm sorry, Dave.
2010-10-13T23:28:21  <bhasker> how come i beat 5th ranked bot
2010-10-13T23:28:22  <deepblue> oh well
2010-10-13T23:28:23  <dmj111> rebelxt_: been there.  a lot.  since I use mercurial, I have a funny looking graph.
2010-10-13T23:28:27  <bhasker> but gain 1 elo point
2010-10-13T23:28:29  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-13T23:28:31  <deepblue> i messes something up
2010-10-13T23:28:37  <dmj111> Zannick: ha.
2010-10-13T23:29:15  <bhasker> meh lost by one ship
2010-10-13T23:29:16  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=477154
2010-10-13T23:30:40  <rebelxt_> bhasker: why did you attack that 10 neutral on first turn? ;-)
2010-10-13T23:31:01  <bhasker> well i jjust uncommented the code that ignores planets closer to enemy on first turn
2010-10-13T23:31:13  <bhasker> i saw that on some maps i lose because of that
2010-10-13T23:31:21  <bhasker> where he goes after my planets
2010-10-13T23:31:23  <bhasker> and i ignore his
2010-10-13T23:31:36  <bhasker> so i thought i will try it without that code
2010-10-13T23:31:53  <bhasker> though i am wondering if i should add some range
2010-10-13T23:31:59  <bhasker> if its further than a certain distance then ignore
2010-10-13T23:32:07  <bhasker> or something
2010-10-13T23:32:50  <rebelxt_> yeah it seems first turn is just ur half of the world and potentially same distance as enemy (depending on cost)
2010-10-13T23:33:07  <rebelxt_> who is oldman btw?
2010-10-13T23:33:10  <bhasker> no idea
2010-10-13T23:33:14  <bhasker> his bot is quite good
2010-10-13T23:33:21  <rebelxt_> yeah

2010-10-13T23:35:30  <bhasker> still have a few planet selection bugs to fix
2010-10-13T23:36:39  <jukkerknott_> I was having a decent battle with deepblue up to a point... my bot *forgot* to capture a 5 growth during the middle of battle: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=477233
2010-10-13T23:37:17  <bhasker> my bot does that if it gets behind too much
2010-10-13T23:37:24  <bhasker> it just doesn't try for the neutral after that
2010-10-13T23:37:30  <bhasker> and then its a losing battle from that point on
2010-10-13T23:37:57  <bhasker> basically i have some code to not attack neutrals if i am behind
2010-10-13T23:38:01  <rebelxt_> deepblue: gg. your expansion was faster than mine, as usual
2010-10-13T23:38:06  <bhasker> but that works like a two edged sword
2010-10-13T23:38:10  <jukkerknott_> yeah
2010-10-13T23:38:12  <bhasker> double edged rather*
2010-10-13T23:38:19  <deepblue> i still have some issues with it though
2010-10-13T23:39:03  <rebelxt_> deepblue: i can't believe my bot did not go on attack when you took two smallest neutrals

2010-10-13T23:40:42  <deepblue> its great how we all have our small issues to iron out
2010-10-13T23:40:42  <rebelxt_> deepblue: you were down 160 ships for a moment and my bot did not profit. great ;)
2010-10-13T23:40:56  <deepblue> lucky me!
2010-10-13T23:41:15  <jukkerknott_> bhasker: just beat me

2010-10-13T23:42:21  <bhasker> at least that game i can see that my defense code is mostly working
2010-10-13T23:42:27  <bhasker> lots of planets going to zero
2010-10-13T23:43:38  <sigh> bhasker: it's a nice feeling when that happens :)
2010-10-13T23:43:49  <bhasker> yea

2010-10-13T23:45:07  <rebelxt_> deepblue: was this your new bot? or ur last official one?
2010-10-13T23:45:50  <jukkerknott_> who has the bot CCCF?
2010-10-13T23:45:56  <deepblue> no
2010-10-13T23:45:56  <deepblue> it's a little modified

2010-10-13T23:50:15  <bhasker> my bot climbed 20 elo points since you guys started up your bots
2010-10-13T23:50:18  <bhasker> thank you !
2010-10-13T23:50:31  <bhasker> it was annoying to see it move 3 points every hour
2010-10-13T23:51:36  <rebelxt_> glad to help! ;-)
2010-10-13T23:52:02  <deepblue> i see two disconnects here of malanzan
2010-10-13T23:52:22  <bhasker> !@#!@#!@#
2010-10-13T23:52:23  <contestbot> bhasker: User error -- Replace user.
2010-10-13T23:52:26  <bhasker> modifying code
2010-10-13T23:52:30  <bhasker> while running bot
2010-10-13T23:52:32  <bhasker> == bad idea
2010-10-13T23:52:35  <bhasker> syntax error 4tl
2010-10-13T23:52:36  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-13T23:52:38  <deepblue> hehe
2010-10-13T23:52:41  <bhasker> lost 8 games in a row
2010-10-13T23:52:42  <bhasker> lol
2010-10-13T23:52:57  <deepblue> bye bye elo points ;)
2010-10-13T23:52:57  <sigh> make it self-modifying
2010-10-13T23:53:05  <rebelxt_> doh lol
2010-10-13T23:53:07  <bhasker> i was playing with the distance heuristic
2010-10-13T23:53:16  <bhasker> to make it not go for far off planets
2010-10-13T23:53:19  <bhasker> and had a syntax error in there
2010-10-13T23:53:21  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-13T23:53:34  <bhasker> i lost only like 6 elo points though
2010-10-13T23:53:35  <bhasker> so thats good
2010-10-13T23:54:07  <sigh> bhasker: what language are you using?
2010-10-13T23:54:12  <bhasker> python
2010-10-13T23:54:27  <bhasker> so no compilation
2010-10-13T23:54:30  <sigh> yeah
2010-10-13T23:55:22  <rebelxt_> python rocks.. and is slow as hell ;)
2010-10-13T23:55:24  *** Mathnerd314 <Mathnerd314!~mathnerd3@dsl.6.28.53.206.cos.dyn.pcisys.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2010-10-13T23:55:53  <amstan> rebelxt_: slow for the computer, fast for us
2010-10-13T23:57:29  <jukkerknott_> deepblue! finally beat you in a game hehe
2010-10-13T23:58:02  <rebelxt_> amstan: oh yeah! almost done re-writing my bot back to c++, and it's much longer (LOC)
