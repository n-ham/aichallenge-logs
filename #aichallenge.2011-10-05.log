2011-10-05T00:00:02  <McLeopold> I'm sure I wrote the code in Feb :)
2011-10-05T00:00:54  <mleise> Actually you wrote so much code (website, SQL, ant paste, engine, starter bots) that I wonder how you manage that all.
2011-10-05T00:01:28  <mleise> don't you end up writing python in PHP and SQL in C++?
2011-10-05T00:01:52  <McLeopold> no, but I keep janzert busy with my bugs :)
2011-10-05T00:02:40  <mleise> Recently I wanted to write in a typed language and I was constantly forgetting to mention return or variable types thanks to too much JS exposure

2011-10-05T04:38:51  <eashoka> seems like there is a problem in the profile :-) http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=9
2011-10-05T04:39:20  <McLeopold> where's the problem?
2011-10-05T04:39:48  <eashoka> after playing 1 game with version 8, it has again updated the skill of version 7
2011-10-05T04:39:52  <eashoka> look at the top 2 games
2011-10-05T04:40:12  <eashoka> skill of the top game should be awarded to version 8 instead.
2011-10-05T04:40:24  <eashoka> some threading issue may be ?
2011-10-05T04:40:35  <McLeopold> meh, probably
2011-10-05T04:40:52  <McLeopold> we can't halt a game just because someone submitted a new bot

2011-10-05T04:43:19  <eashoka> mcleopold : I see
2011-10-05T04:44:57  <eashoka> mcleopold : yea the summary for version 7 (at the bottom section) shows the skill after it's 203th game. then this is not a big issue I guess. (except some may get confused looking at the top of the profile page)

2011-10-05T05:30:51  <nh_> yeah
2011-10-05T05:31:09  <mleise> shall we add a FreePascal support?
2011-10-05T05:34:32  <McLeopold> I used to know pascal...

2011-10-05T05:41:02  <mleise> nh_: I think I could add Pascal support. We have quite a few languages already that are used by only few people.

2011-10-05T06:52:37  <mleise> I thought Google was the new world order?
2011-10-05T06:52:46  <mcstar> for a time maybe it is
2011-10-05T06:53:19  <mleise> it is in dictionaries even. (to) google smth.
2011-10-05T06:53:35  <mcstar> sg.
2011-10-05T06:53:47  <mcstar> i believe something is shortened as sg.
2011-10-05T06:53:51  <mleise> when did you last say "Let me ibm that quickly."
2011-10-05T06:53:54  <mcstar> at least thats how i learnt it
2011-10-05T06:53:56  <jbroman> IBM is an old company, yes. And yes, they've done some impressive research (inc. AI research). I'm not sure its brand is nearly as strong, though.
2011-10-05T06:54:37  <mcstar> of course my opinion is only an opinion, and i dont debate hard facts
2011-10-05T06:54:51  <mcstar> im just saying IBM sounds at least as cool as google
2011-10-05T06:55:22  <mcstar> so, if, maybe, google doesnt want to give enough money, turn somewhere else
2011-10-05T06:55:59  <mcstar> tell me some other brands that you would like to see in the name of the challenge?
2011-10-05T06:56:09  <mcstar> i resent ms/apple
2011-10-05T06:56:11  <mleise> Amazon?
2011-10-05T06:56:17  <mcstar> no yahoo or amazon
2011-10-05T06:56:40  <mleise> lol, Amazon AI Challenge. That sounds really disconnected
2011-10-05T06:56:48  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-05T06:57:03  <mcstar> "hey, it runs on the kindle, great"
2011-10-05T06:57:06  <jbroman> TBH, one option for the future is not naming the contest after them, but say "sponsored by Foo".
2011-10-05T06:57:11  <jbroman> Where Foo may even be multiple companies.
2011-10-05T06:57:19  <mcstar> thats good too
2011-10-05T06:57:30  <mcstar> but are they willing to share sponsoring?
2011-10-05T06:57:33  <eashoka> mleise, mcstar : beggers can't be choosers! I suggest ask and then take money from anybody who is willing :-)
2011-10-05T06:57:57  <jbroman> mcstar: If one company is not willing to fund the entire thing, sure. Depends on how expensive we become.
2011-10-05T06:58:04  <mcstar> eashoka: if the biggest isnt up to give money, why would some other company?
2011-10-05T06:59:12  <mcstar> of course you can say, to appeal to a second company: hey, you get to sponsore something, that google just refused, therefore, if it becomes successful, you get the fame instead of google
2011-10-05T06:59:36  <jbroman> I wouldn't say "Google refused".
2011-10-05T06:59:40  <mcstar> not yet
2011-10-05T06:59:43  <mcstar> :D
2011-10-05T06:59:49  <jbroman> Even if they did.
2011-10-05T06:59:54  <mcstar> yeah, im exaggerating
2011-10-05T07:00:02  <jbroman> I'm not convinced that saying "your competitor didn't think it was worth it" is an attractive play.
2011-10-05T07:00:35  <mcstar> i think it can be :), bit of a gamble, sure
2011-10-05T07:01:09  <mcstar> my opinion again, is that i would perfectly fine if ANY university would put its name to it
2011-10-05T07:01:21  <mleise> who would you fine?

2011-10-05T07:02:06  <jbroman> mcstar: Used to have "Computer Science Club of the University of Waterloo" in the name. But we don't have a ton of money. :P
2011-10-05T07:02:22  <eashoka> surely it can't be that much to keep ther servers running for 2 months ? (I guess that will be the main cost, we all can help in spreading the word across.. no need for paid advertisements)
2011-10-05T07:02:22  <eashoka> jbroman : have you got any figures (estimates) on exactly how much we are going to cost ?
2011-10-05T07:02:34  <mcstar> unfortunately, i think it would be perfectly cool to call it the waterloo uni. contest
2011-10-05T07:02:35  <jbroman> eashoka: Ask j3camero, janzert or amstan.
2011-10-05T07:03:28  <mcstar> i dont think it was paid-advertised in the past, was it?

2011-10-05T08:27:09  <spacebat_> with a debug flag, be sure its off before you submit
2011-10-05T08:27:41  <Gero> ok thc you. It s what i was working on.
2011-10-05T08:27:57  <spacebat_> perhaps make your bot require a command line arg to turn debug on, and write a wrapper script that you use for testing that enables debug
2011-10-05T08:28:35  <spacebat_> I'm wondering if there is an event to indicate that a hill has been razed
2011-10-05T08:28:54  <Gero> Good idea i will try this =)
2011-10-05T08:29:09  <spacebat_> and what it takes to raze a hill - just move an enemy ant over it for 1 turn?
2011-10-05T08:30:51  <spacebat_> with respect to the sponsorship question earlier, I think it a good idea to use paypal and charge $2 or so to join the contest
2011-10-05T08:31:41  <spacebat_> monies left over can go into either a prize or funding development of the next year's challenge
2011-10-05T08:32:05  <spacebat_> without sponsorship, an impressive enough name would be the world AI challenge

2011-10-05T09:56:30  <delt0r_> yes
2011-10-05T09:56:39  <delt0r_> by paypal
2011-10-05T09:56:49  <mcstar> i wouldnt mind if you were a little more verbose
2011-10-05T09:56:53  <mcstar> what happened?
2011-10-05T09:56:53  <delt0r_> they still try to take cash from the canceled CC
2011-10-05T09:57:22  <delt0r_> They randomly decided that i owed them 400US
2011-10-05T09:57:33  <mcstar> :S
2011-10-05T09:57:52  <mcstar> were you using paypal actively?
2011-10-05T09:58:05  <delt0r_> no
2011-10-05T09:58:18  <delt0r_> just because some site needed it
2011-10-05T09:58:45  <delt0r_> so i had only 20EU of legit transactions
2011-10-05T09:58:51  <mcstar> im registered with them, but never actually payed anything through them, as far as i can remember
2011-10-05T09:59:46  <delt0r_> I would recommend against it
2011-10-05T09:59:55  <mcstar> so how did you resolve this fiasco?
2011-10-05T10:00:29  <delt0r_> I canceled my Credit card and got things reversed via my bank and CC
2011-10-05T10:01:20  <delt0r_> if you want payments from them... then read the terms and conditions.
2011-10-05T10:01:53  <mcstar> what is CC?
2011-10-05T10:02:06  <delt0r_> They have a "if we think you are fraudulent we will block all payments and keep the cash and you agree to never challenge our decision"
2011-10-05T10:02:11  <delt0r_> Credit Card
2011-10-05T10:02:18  <mcstar> nub me

2011-10-05T10:04:19  <kikoo_> There is something to do to attack with an ant or just need to move it at range ?
2011-10-05T10:05:41  <mcstar> you can only control the next desired direction of the ant
2011-10-05T10:06:11  <mcstar> i.e. you may or may not be able to move the ant for the next turn 1 step in the desired direction

2011-10-05T19:18:05  <CIA-24> aichallenge: Marco Leise epsilon * r97549d1 / setup/worker_setup.py : added FreePascal compiler - http://git.io/yHENXQ
2011-10-05T19:18:05  <CIA-24> aichallenge: Marco Leise epsilon * r7b15cf6 / (32 files in 8 dirs): Merge branch 'epsilon' of github.com:aichallenge/aichallenge into epsilon - http://git.io/OpNlvw
2011-10-05T19:29:50  <mleise> McLeopold: That script asks me too many questions
2011-10-05T19:30:40  <McLeopold> mleise: are you setting up a test server?
2011-10-05T19:30:52  <McLeopold> or a test worker?
2011-10-05T19:31:27  <mleise> no, I don't have an Ubuntu installation to mess around with. I planned on updating aichallengebeta
2011-10-05T19:35:24  <McLeopold> mleise: languages go on the workers, not the main server
2011-10-05T19:37:04  <mleise> McLeopold: oh Walter answered me.. wait a sec
2011-10-05T19:37:50  <mleise> "Yes. Feel free to do this."
2011-10-05T19:39:53  <mleise> McLeopold: I'll just wait till someone gets around to starting a server then. I have to write a Pascal starter package first anyway.
2011-10-05T19:42:34  <McLeopold> okay
2011-10-05T19:42:54  <McLeopold> did you just need the fpc package?
2011-10-05T19:43:16  <mleise> Yes, I added fp-compiler to the package list

2011-10-05T23:58:59  <UncleVasya> Hi. GreenTea uploaded his bot 4 minutes earlier than I did. Jered59 - 12 minutes after me. Both of them already played 5 games while mine played 0. Our uploads were made nearly 5 hours ago.
