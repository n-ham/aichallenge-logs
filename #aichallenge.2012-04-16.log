2012-04-16T08:52:24  <mcstar> thank you
2012-04-16T08:52:39  <mcstar> listen, did you do week4 programming assignment?
2012-04-16T08:52:48  <mcstar> the damn thing doesnt want to accept my answer
2012-04-16T08:52:54  <mcstar> and the answer is right
2012-04-16T08:53:14  <pairofdice> Nope, haven't participated on any of the coursera courses
2012-04-16T08:53:32  <mcstar> o.O
2012-04-16T08:53:41  <mcstar> i thought you are doing crypto

2012-04-16T09:05:10  <mcstar> what kind of life is that
2012-04-16T09:05:20  <mcstar> that gang life
2012-04-16T09:05:32  <antimatroid> yeah it's crazy
2012-04-16T09:05:39  <antimatroid> i like the safety of australia
2012-04-16T09:05:47  <antimatroid> gun ownership here is minimal
2012-04-16T09:06:04  <antimatroid> and violent crimes etc. aren't very high, especially if you don't involve yourself with such people
2012-04-16T09:06:20  <pairofdice> It's the massive drug war
2012-04-16T09:06:43  <mcstar> drugs and gangs go hand in hand
2012-04-16T09:06:47  <antimatroid> politician: "I'm going to reject your evidence based research in favour of what will get me more votes, problem?"
2012-04-16T09:06:48  <mcstar> usually
2012-04-16T09:07:09  <mcstar> but i wouldnt sa that 'ganging' happens only because of drug
2012-04-16T09:07:36  <antimatroid> no, but drug markets fund activities which escalate the violence people are willing to commit etc.
2012-04-16T09:08:08  <mcstar> i think this was all planned by the cia
2012-04-16T09:08:22  <mcstar> ok, kidding
2012-04-16T09:09:31  <mcstar> some countries are just a joke
2012-04-16T09:09:39  <pairofdice> A lot of it would go away if the drugs were legal
2012-04-16T09:09:51  <mcstar> whoa
2012-04-16T09:09:57  <antimatroid> i think we should avoid this conversation in here
2012-04-16T09:10:03  <antimatroid> although i agree

2012-04-16T09:52:38  <thestinger> and it was wrong, because the answer was O(n^2)
2012-04-16T09:52:42  <thestinger> which is what I meant
2012-04-16T09:52:55  <mcstar> or theta
2012-04-16T09:53:14  <rwest> I really hated my Algorithms class
2012-04-16T09:53:18  <mcstar> thestinger: the system didnt accept my week4 prog. assignment
2012-04-16T09:53:41  <rwest> seemed fairly pointless to do all that calculation to get the running time when I could just look at it and give a good enough approximation
2012-04-16T09:53:47  <mcstar> i forgot to change the escaped quotes, \" to "
2012-04-16T09:54:32  <thestinger> hmm, why were they escaped?
2012-04-16T09:54:49  <mcstar> thats how haskell shows strings
2012-04-16T09:54:53  <thestinger> ah
2012-04-16T09:55:04  <mcstar> i didnt write a program for that one though
2012-04-16T09:55:20  <mcstar> just needed a hex to [Int] conversion
2012-04-16T09:55:20  <rwest> mcstar: you really love haskell
2012-04-16T09:55:33  <mcstar> do i?
2012-04-16T09:55:40  <rwest> you seem to be using it a lot
2012-04-16T09:55:42  <thestinger> rwest: haskell is awesome
2012-04-16T09:55:46  <rwest> LIES!
2012-04-16T09:55:56  <mcstar> rwest: i try to, haskell is awesome
2012-04-16T09:55:57  <thestinger> every other programming language just reeks of "this is awful, but it works"
2012-04-16T09:56:26  <mcstar> while haskell is: i have no clue about this, but it works!
2012-04-16T09:56:38  <rwest> it is so ugly
2012-04-16T09:56:42  <thestinger> well, "this is awesome, but I have no idea how to use it" :P
2012-04-16T09:56:56  <mcstar> rwest: that is totally invalid
2012-04-16T09:57:04  <thestinger> rwest: the only reason for that is because they use operators and not english words
2012-04-16T09:57:08  <mcstar> it has the best ML syntax
2012-04-16T09:57:14  <mcstar> i mean in the funcitnal family
2012-04-16T09:57:23  <rwest> or maybe it's the standard formatting that makes it so
2012-04-16T09:57:40  <antimatroid> if c++ let me overload anything as an operator and precedence i would be a happy man
2012-04-16T09:58:00  <mcstar> ..ignorance is bliss, hear this somewhere
2012-04-16T09:58:03  <mcstar> heard*
2012-04-16T09:58:13  <rwest> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/containers/latest/doc/html/src/Data-Graph.html
2012-04-16T09:58:18  <rwest> so I am looking at that
2012-04-16T09:58:22  <rwest> and that seems pretty ugly
2012-04-16T09:58:33  <rwest> ugly/intimidating
2012-04-16T09:58:36  <thestinger> antimatroid: it can't be added, because it would be massively change existing programs :(
2012-04-16T09:59:05  <thestinger> well, at least some things
2012-04-16T09:59:08  <mcstar> rwest: everything is quite cmpact there
2012-04-16T09:59:11  <mcstar> that is good

2012-04-16T09:59:28  <thestinger> which are already well defined
2012-04-16T09:59:28  <mcstar> and is a file, from which the docs are generated too
2012-04-16T10:00:11  <thestinger> mcstar: can't you just submit again?
2012-04-16T10:00:15  <thestinger> it says the deadline is the 17th
2012-04-16T10:00:27  <mcstar> ?
2012-04-16T10:00:38  <thestinger> the crypto programming thing
2012-04-16T10:00:39  <mcstar> ofc i submitted again
2012-04-16T10:00:59  <mcstar> i submitted many times
2012-04-16T10:01:08  <mcstar> i tried submitting hex encoding
2012-04-16T10:01:11  <mcstar> i tried with without the padding
2012-04-16T10:01:14  <mcstar> 09
2012-04-16T10:01:22  <mcstar> i tried with quotes without quotes
2012-04-16T10:01:37  <mcstar> until i figured out the problem is the inner escaped quotes
2012-04-16T10:02:08  <mcstar> thestinger: where do you see 17th?
2012-04-16T10:02:16  <mcstar> Mon 16 Apr 2012 11:59:00 PM PDT
2012-04-16T10:02:32  <mcstar> that was around 5am here
2012-04-16T10:02:35  <mcstar> or 6

2012-04-16T10:03:21  <mcstar> hm
2012-04-16T10:03:55  <thestinger> I signed up for 2 udacity courses that start today
2012-04-16T10:04:15  <thestinger> I think I'll want to do ml-class so I don't think signing up for 3-4 is a good idea :P
2012-04-16T10:04:45  <mcstar> rwest: structure is very important, many things are pattern matched
2012-04-16T10:05:23  <rwest> mcstar ugh, I am very unorthodox with my formatting I think
2012-04-16T10:05:25  <mcstar> and in the libs you have type signatures of nearly everything, but most of it you can actually skip
2012-04-16T10:05:36  <rwest> like I prefer: } else {
2012-04-16T10:05:46  <mcstar> you can have that in haskell
2012-04-16T10:05:47  <rwest> and other things that compact code
2012-04-16T10:05:51  <mcstar> i mean {}
2012-04-16T10:05:52  <thestinger> that's not unorthodox
2012-04-16T10:06:15  <rwest> for the 2 places I have worked since college it has been
2012-04-16T10:06:22  <mcstar> } else { is not cmpact, }else{ is
2012-04-16T10:06:30  <rwest> and wasting a line for a single bracket
2012-04-16T10:06:33  <rwest> that drives me nuts
2012-04-16T10:06:45  <mcstar> c++ seems idiotic, if you dont
2012-04-16T10:06:56  * thestinger doesn't think so
2012-04-16T10:07:01  <mcstar> do you close like lisp does?
2012-04-16T10:07:05  <thestinger> just have to extensively use the hanging-bracket thing from python
2012-04-16T10:07:10  <rwest> no, I don't
2012-04-16T10:07:14  <rwest> that is harder to read
2012-04-16T10:07:29  <rwest> well I will close like that in a multi-line if statement
2012-04-16T10:07:39  <rwest> but nowhere else really
2012-04-16T10:07:39  <mcstar> you said you dont waste a line for a single bracket, then how do you close them?
2012-04-16T10:07:58  <rwest> I mean: if (blah) { <--- that bracket
2012-04-16T10:08:03  <rwest> the opener
2012-04-16T10:08:13  <mcstar> but im interested in the closing bracket
2012-04-16T10:08:21  <mcstar> fun(){
2012-04-16T10:08:24  <mcstar> }
2012-04-16T10:08:28  <mcstar> or fun(){
2012-04-16T10:08:31  <mcstar> statement;}
2012-04-16T10:08:38  <rwest> yes that one on it's own line
2012-04-16T10:09:03  <rwest> I don't work on much non object oriented code anymore
2012-04-16T10:09:09  <rwest> so it's clearer in meaning
2012-04-16T10:10:08  <thestinger> mcstar: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/WRD1EsC6LYEkn1yA4dtC/ I use that indent style too
2012-04-16T10:10:18  <rwest> I think much of my formating has come from doing so much code in tcl
2012-04-16T10:10:23  <thestinger> you start else without a newline, it doesn't apply to closing brackets
2012-04-16T10:10:54  <rwest> thestinger: that is how my code looks
2012-04-16T10:11:06  <mcstar> thestinger: i do it like that, without those damn extra spaces, and and 2 spaces for indentation
2012-04-16T10:11:25  <rwest> I have to do 4 spaces for indentation
2012-04-16T10:11:31  <thestinger> mcstar: I can easily change the indentation because I can just autoindent the whole file without change it
2012-04-16T10:11:33  <thestinger> changing it*
2012-04-16T10:11:34  <rwest> or emacs will break all the files
2012-04-16T10:11:46  <rwest> and then I get some great diffs
2012-04-16T10:11:50  <thestinger> had to mess with cindentoptions or whatever it's called to get the hanging-indent thing
2012-04-16T10:12:11  <thestinger> sadly python itself requires a new syntax file in vim for proper auto-indent
2012-04-16T10:15:02  <mcstar> mathematica autoindents http://imgur.com/QjVIV
2012-04-16T10:15:27  <mcstar> i didnt even have any syntax highlighting before 6.0
2012-04-16T10:16:16  <mcstar> it is easy if you syntax is lispy
2012-04-16T10:16:19  <mcstar> youre
2012-04-16T10:16:24  <mcstar> damn your
2012-04-16T10:16:36  <rwest> emacs syntax highlighting is just done by lisp
2012-04-16T10:17:06  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-04-16T10:17:27  <mcstar> (i mean what kind of relevance does it have?)
2012-04-16T10:17:28  <rwest> to create a new syntax highlight mode, you create a lisp file to do it
2012-04-16T10:17:56  <mcstar> i wouldnt put it that way
2012-04-16T10:18:04  <mcstar> you write a highlighter in emacslisp
2012-04-16T10:18:12  <rwest> well yes, elisp
2012-04-16T10:21:45  <thestinger> mcstar: the week5 crypto stuff is neat
2012-04-16T10:21:50  <thestinger> much different than the previous weeks
2012-04-16T10:23:20  <mcstar> lol
2012-04-16T10:23:23  <mcstar> do a barrel roll
2012-04-16T10:23:32  <mcstar> have you tried this?
2012-04-16T10:24:07  <thestinger> ?
2012-04-16T10:24:16  <mcstar> write that into google search
2012-04-16T10:24:21  <mcstar> and enter
2012-04-16T10:24:23  <thestinger> I know
2012-04-16T10:24:26  <thestinger> tilt works too
2012-04-16T10:24:38  <thestinger> I forget the others
2012-04-16T10:25:53  <thestinger> mcstar: askew
2012-04-16T10:25:54  <thestinger> that works too
2012-04-16T10:26:08  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-16T10:26:13  <mcstar> but 'let it snow' doesnt
2012-04-16T10:26:27  <pairofdice> and gravity
2012-04-16T10:26:38  <pairofdice> it's not christmas!
2012-04-16T10:29:17  <thestinger> mcstar: I realized I don't really need an associative array for the trie
2012-04-16T10:29:35  <thestinger> I can just store the children by value in an array and search for the right one (and add a char member)
2012-04-16T10:29:53  <thestinger> there can be 256 at most (for strings at least)
2012-04-16T10:30:25  <thestinger> a u32string should probably be stored as a string
2012-04-16T10:33:58  <thestinger> http://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/datrie.html all kinds of fancy solutions too
2012-04-16T10:36:26  <mcstar> recursion is nice
2012-04-16T10:36:39  <pairofdice> oh, tries look cool
2012-04-16T10:37:35  <thestinger> atm mine is just the naive basic trie
2012-04-16T10:37:39  <thestinger> one node per character
2012-04-16T10:37:39  <mcstar> Error 01: Brainwaves received in analog. Please re-think in digital.
2012-04-16T10:37:53  <mcstar> have you tried searchign for recursion?
2012-04-16T10:37:57  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-16T10:38:40  <thestinger> pairofdice: they're neat because they give fast lookup, but you can also quickly look up all sequences starting with a prefix
2012-04-16T10:39:04  <thestinger> you just walk down to the node representing the end of the prefix
2012-04-16T10:39:21  <thestinger> and then return all values stored underneath that node (with a depth-first search)

2012-04-16T16:04:31  <thestinger> unicode totally screws it over :(
2012-04-16T16:04:49  <thestinger> not really sure why but operator< seems unicode aware
2012-04-16T16:04:53  <thestinger> for std::string
2012-04-16T16:05:11  <mcstar> is that surprising?
2012-04-16T16:05:15  <thestinger> yes
2012-04-16T16:05:19  <thestinger> it's a byte string
2012-04-16T16:05:36  <mcstar> string <> means alphabetical ordering
2012-04-16T16:05:47  <mcstar> that exists for unicode too
2012-04-16T16:06:10  <mcstar> or am i missing something?

2012-04-16T16:06:41  <thestinger> mcstar: std::string is std::basic_string<char>
2012-04-16T16:06:44  <thestinger> it's a byte string
2012-04-16T16:06:55  <mcstar> fine with me
2012-04-16T16:07:04  <thestinger> and it's not a multibyte string, it's not supposed to be unicode aware afaik
2012-04-16T16:07:05  <mcstar> and unicode is what wchar?
2012-04-16T16:07:09  <thestinger> no
2012-04-16T16:07:43  <thestinger> char32_t represents unicode codepoints
2012-04-16T16:08:00  <thestinger> char16_t is a utf-16 code-point (multi-byte encoding)
2012-04-16T16:08:05  <thestinger> wchar_t is platform specific
2012-04-16T16:08:34  <thestinger> they had to make char16_t/char32_t because microsoft never switched to UCS4 (utf-32) for wchar_t
2012-04-16T16:08:58  <thestinger> wchar_t is basically useless :P
2012-04-16T16:09:22  <thestinger> if you only want to target linux then you can use it
2012-04-16T16:10:05  <mcstar> ive been thinking about asteroids
2012-04-16T16:11:26  <mcstar> collision detection could be done with masking
2012-04-16T16:11:49  <mcstar> i have no idea how efficient this would be
2012-04-16T16:11:54  <mcstar> i should try it out
2012-04-16T16:12:24  <thestinger> forward and reverse walk through a trie with "bog", "dog", "frog" and "smog": http://sprunge.us/WjYL http://sprunge.us/ajJK
2012-04-16T16:12:27  <thestinger> at least that works :P
2012-04-16T16:12:36  <thestinger> 0 means it's not an end node, 1 means it is
2012-04-16T16:12:51  <thestinger> the actual output of the iterator is just the stuff with 1
2012-04-16T16:13:56  <thestinger> actually have to walk the children backwards to get the forwards order
2012-04-16T16:14:15  <thestinger> since a DFS uses a stack
2012-04-16T16:14:39  <thestinger> but in the recursive version walking forwards gets the forwards order...
2012-04-16T16:14:46  <mcstar> just make sure you get good money for this
2012-04-16T16:15:03  <mcstar> sry, but ive got couple of things to do
2012-04-16T16:15:13  <thestinger> well, knowing how this arcane C++ stuff works is probably worth something :)
