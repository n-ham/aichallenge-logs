2012-08-01T10:02:02  <UVs> Now I am happy and proud of myself :D
2012-08-01T10:02:17  <mcstar> UVs: who are you, and how do you know my name?
2012-08-01T10:02:30  <mcstar> and what did you do to UncleVasya?
2012-08-01T10:02:56  *** UVs is now known as UncleVasya
2012-08-01T10:03:02  <mcstar> ah :)
2012-08-01T10:03:22  <mcstar> omg, its full of porn
2012-08-01T10:04:13  <mcstar> no, i dont want to play Crazy Monkey
2012-08-01T10:04:30  <UncleVasya> > and what did you do to UncleVasya? -----  I've zipped him to UVs :)
2012-08-01T10:05:05  <mcstar> i see, you like open algebraic types
2012-08-01T10:05:56  <antimatroid1> mornin'
2012-08-01T10:06:04  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you dont need the ;;s
2012-08-01T10:06:27  <mcstar> and you dont need ; after a pattern match clause
2012-08-01T10:06:46  <mcstar> only, when you want to sequence something
2012-08-01T10:06:55  <mcstar> like:
2012-08-01T10:07:09  <mcstar> print_endline ..; print_nations ...
2012-08-01T10:07:16  <mcstar> antimatroid1: hiya
2012-08-01T10:07:25  <UncleVasya> but if I try delete any ;;  I get syntax error :p
2012-08-01T10:07:27  <antimatroid1> how's it going?
2012-08-01T10:07:45  <mcstar> UncleVasya: ill try
2012-08-01T10:07:52  <mcstar> antimatroid1: good, great
2012-08-01T10:08:00  <antimatroid1> i want sleep
2012-08-01T10:08:02  <mcstar> antimatroid1: been reading some forum post on blade runner
2012-08-01T10:08:06  <antimatroid1> but have a meeting with phd advisors tomorrow
2012-08-01T10:08:10  <antimatroid1> well today
2012-08-01T10:08:15  <antimatroid1> so should do some moar work aha
2012-08-01T10:08:26  <mcstar> work-out
2012-08-01T10:08:41  <antimatroid1> it's 12:08am
2012-08-01T10:08:48  <antimatroid1> and cold outside
2012-08-01T10:09:10  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i realized i cannot copy-paste from an image
2012-08-01T10:09:15  <UncleVasya> mcstar: btw, thanks for advices.
2012-08-01T10:10:21  <UncleVasya> what is the name of that super-puper online paste that even runs your code?
2012-08-01T10:10:31  <mcstar> im pretty sure what i wrote about ;;s are correct, dont know why it doesnt work for you

2012-08-01T10:24:30  <UVs> Now I know new way to declare type:  type nationType = Ukranian | Russian | American   But on't know the difference yet :)
2012-08-01T10:24:51  <mcstar> i told you
2012-08-01T10:24:58  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@62.61.58.19> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
2012-08-01T10:25:01  <mcstar> the one with the ` is an open type
2012-08-01T10:25:07  <mcstar> this is a closed algebraic type
2012-08-01T10:25:10  <mcstar> (sum type)
2012-08-01T10:25:51  <UVs> OK, I'm going too google what is open type and closed type :D
2012-08-01T10:26:18  <mcstar> the former can be extended
2012-08-01T10:26:20  <mcstar> thats all
2012-08-01T10:26:43  <mcstar> sort of like, having a superclass, and you can make any of your new classes a subtype of that
2012-08-01T10:27:06  <mcstar> but with traditional smu types, you cant extend the number of different constrcutors, it is given at the definition
2012-08-01T10:27:51  <mcstar> UVs: how does notepad++ load up the code?
2012-08-01T10:28:05  <mcstar> if it just directly pipes it top ocaml it wont work

2012-08-01T10:30:09  <mcstar> you should use the top from emacs
2012-08-01T10:30:18  <mcstar> it can load single expressions or the whole buffer
2012-08-01T10:30:29  <mcstar> so when you can, download it
2012-08-01T10:31:23  <mcstar> 46MBs
2012-08-01T10:42:31  <UVs> To pass file to interpreter I use cmd /c ocaml < filename in npp.
2012-08-01T10:44:05  <mcstar> uh
2012-08-01T10:44:18  <UVs> How do you know about closed and open types? From documentation or some article?
2012-08-01T10:44:51  <mcstar> i dont remember
2012-08-01T10:44:56  <mcstar> it was a long time ago
2012-08-01T10:45:17  <mcstar> you can run the file as a script with 'ocaml file'
2012-08-01T10:45:45  <mcstar> and there are other possibilities too
2012-08-01T10:45:51  <mcstar> like the #use directive
2012-08-01T10:46:17  <mcstar> # #use "src/ocaml/uv2.ml";;
2012-08-01T10:46:59  <mcstar> so, alternatively, to keep the toplevel running, you can edit the file in notepad++ and just use this command to load up the file
2012-08-01T10:47:15  <mcstar> and you dont have to type this every time
2012-08-01T10:47:37  <mcstar> if the toplevel that comes with windows doesnt have line editing/history, use rlwrap in cygwin
2012-08-01T10:47:56  <mcstar> but i think the windows installation has GUI toplevel, doesnt it?
2012-08-01T10:48:21  <mcstar> i installed ocaml on my virtual win7 once
2012-08-01T10:52:15  <UVs> It has (doesn't launch on my notebook, but that's okay) :)
2012-08-01T10:52:48  <antimatroid1> woo i have something new to talk to them about
2012-08-01T10:53:22  <mcstar> antimatroid1: yes, all planar graphs are 4 colorable
2012-08-01T10:53:49  <antimatroid1> i am working with planar hyper graphs actually
2012-08-01T10:54:04  <mcstar> eh
2012-08-01T10:54:09  <antimatroid1> they have to be planar inside a rectangle too
2012-08-01T10:54:19  <mcstar> those arent really planar then? or whats the definition?
2012-08-01T10:54:28  <antimatroid1> i'll show you
2012-08-01T10:54:29  <antimatroid1> http://sketchia.com/draw.html

2012-08-01T10:56:38  <antimatroid1> why do my lines keep disappearing
2012-08-01T10:56:51  <mcstar> yeah i had to redraw my flower too
2012-08-01T10:57:06  <mcstar> it appears, then it is deleted back
2012-08-01T10:57:16  <mcstar> some synchronisational problem i think
2012-08-01T10:57:17  <antimatroid1> fark
2012-08-01T10:57:18  <antimatroid1> i give up
2012-08-01T10:57:22  <antimatroid1> it's being a piece of shit
2012-08-01T10:57:25  <antimatroid1> it's usually not that bad
2012-08-01T10:57:30  <mcstar> hah
2012-08-01T10:57:46  <antimatroid1> i don't have the patience right now for that :p
2012-08-01T10:58:36  <mcstar> i drew you a cat with whiskars
2012-08-01T11:01:42  <mcstar> wtf
2012-08-01T11:01:48  <mcstar> it disappeared, my cat is gone
2012-08-01T11:03:15  <antimatroid1> http://sketchia.com/draw.html#DAzWyr8
2012-08-01T11:03:17  <antimatroid1> there we go
2012-08-01T11:03:35  <antimatroid1> each thing between two levels of dots is a "generator"
2012-08-01T11:03:42  <antimatroid1> my thing is to find the structure of the semigroup they generate
2012-08-01T11:04:04  <antimatroid1> to take the product of say two, you just forget the dots in the middle and the hyperedges and the lines that are joined
2012-08-01T11:04:35  <antimatroid1> so to take the product of lots like that, just forget all the middle dots, all joined lines are a hyperedge
2012-08-01T11:04:41  <antimatroid1> for the moment loops i just ignore
2012-08-01T11:04:44  <mcstar> antimatroid1: when i argued about your first problem, i found it better to just link the nodes  in a straight line
2012-08-01T11:04:54  <mcstar> well, not straight, but a single line
2012-08-01T11:05:00  <antimatroid1> wut?
2012-08-01T11:05:03  <antimatroid1> what first problem?
2012-08-01T11:05:11  <mcstar> like those red lines
2012-08-01T11:05:19  <mcstar> what you talked about?
2012-08-01T11:05:28  <mcstar> this connect the dots game
2012-08-01T11:05:59  <mcstar> what are the possible number of nodes you can connect to if a given number of nodes are already connected
2012-08-01T11:06:02  <antimatroid1> apparently this is useful for physics, but i have no idea how
2012-08-01T11:06:11  <antimatroid1> ah yeah okay
2012-08-01T11:06:11  <antimatroid1> i'
2012-08-01T11:06:18  <antimatroid1> ve since had to generalise my problem there
2012-08-01T11:06:25  <mcstar> anyway, those red lines, just connect them with a single line
2012-08-01T11:06:25  <antimatroid1> and think i've basically showed what i want to
2012-08-01T11:06:30  <antimatroid1> hence something new for the advisors
2012-08-01T11:06:47  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2012-08-01T11:06:51  <antimatroid1> through the dots?
2012-08-01T11:06:53  <mcstar> yes
2012-08-01T11:06:57  <antimatroid1> then it just looks like two edges in a graph
2012-08-01T11:07:04  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-01T11:07:08  <mcstar> it is perfectly ok
2012-08-01T11:07:09  <antimatroid1> i don't want that
2012-08-01T11:07:10  <antimatroid1> gross
2012-08-01T11:07:13  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-01T11:07:19  <mcstar> it made it simpler
2012-08-01T11:07:24  <antimatroid1> i guess it doesn't matter too much
2012-08-01T11:07:27  <antimatroid1> although sometimes it can jump
2012-08-01T11:07:27  <mcstar> thats how i came up with that simpler formula
2012-08-01T11:07:31  <antimatroid1> as shown there
2012-08-01T11:07:38  <antimatroid1> you have 4 of the bottom dots connected
2012-08-01T11:07:56  <antimatroid1> your formula was the same thing from memory?
2012-08-01T11:08:00  <antimatroid1> i was avoiding the use of %
2012-08-01T11:08:24  <mcstar> f(n+1) = f(n) union {(2n)%3}
2012-08-01T11:08:27  <mcstar> i think
2012-08-01T11:08:46  <mcstar> but you should be able to prove the last term more succintly than those inductions you presented
2012-08-01T11:08:59  <mcstar> the first one comes from simply considering integer partitions
2012-08-01T11:09:47  <antimatroid1> bah, not now :P
2012-08-01T11:09:55  <antimatroid1> too late, i will play with it another time though
2012-08-01T11:10:06  <antimatroid1> my brain doesn't want to do more new stuff
2012-08-01T11:10:08  <mcstar> it might have a relevance in physics, because we use diagram expansions a lot in statistical physics and quantum field theories
2012-08-01T11:10:23  <mcstar> and those diagrams sometimes can be represented with dots and lines
2012-08-01T11:10:38  <mcstar> there is some probelem that was directly related to integer partitions
2012-08-01T11:10:43  <antimatroid1> yeah, one of my advisors is a physics person who plays with this kind of stuff
2012-08-01T11:10:46  <mcstar> but i dont remember what was it exaclty
2012-08-01T11:11:02  <antimatroid1> eventually i'll try to get some idea for it, at the moment i'm just playing around with this stuff from a semigroup point of view
2012-08-01T11:11:16  <antimatroid1> algebra <3
2012-08-01T11:11:47  <mcstar> antimatroid1: what it comes down to it, these are expressions of multiple integrals, where the variables of integrations are the dots
2012-08-01T11:12:10  <mcstar> anyway, i havent done much of that, only in classes
2012-08-01T11:12:11  <antimatroid1> that doesn't mean anything to me atm :P
2012-08-01T11:12:14  <antimatroid1> yeah
2012-08-01T11:12:24  <antimatroid1> i need to learn about character theory
2012-08-01T11:12:26  <antimatroid1> shit confuses me
2012-08-01T11:12:46  <antimatroid1> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_theory
2012-08-01T11:12:49  <antimatroid1> :s
2012-08-01T11:12:51  <mcstar> GT?
2012-08-01T11:13:30  <mcstar> im sure it is interesting..
2012-08-01T11:14:25  <mcstar> antimatroid1: you should have made a program that draws your graph
2012-08-01T11:14:30  <mcstar> so you dont have to do it manually
2012-08-01T11:14:42  <mcstar> i wold invest in that in your place
2012-08-01T11:14:43  <antimatroid1> lol, i wouldn't have a clue how to write such a program
2012-08-01T11:14:59  <mcstar> there is graphviz, it has an easy grammar
2012-08-01T11:15:18  <antimatroid1> actually, it's probably not that hard really
2012-08-01T11:15:29  <mcstar> ofc, you need to figure out a comfortable representaton of the connections
2012-08-01T11:15:32  <antimatroid1> i just need to be able to draw the generators and tell it where to place them
2012-08-01T11:15:34  <mcstar> so you can type them in
2012-08-01T11:15:50  <mcstar> antimatroid1: i think its a great haskell excercise for you
2012-08-01T11:15:56  <antimatroid1> i'll have a play with something at some point
2012-08-01T11:15:59  <antimatroid1> i am terrible with haskell
2012-08-01T11:16:24  <mcstar> your advisor's jaw will drow when he will see your pure lazy haskell  functions in action
2012-08-01T11:16:59  <mcstar> for this stuff it is close to perfect
2012-08-01T11:17:23  <antimatroid1> i don't think either of them are really programmers :P
2012-08-01T11:17:43  <mcstar> even better
2012-08-01T11:17:51  <antimatroid1> is that because you can take all permutations lazily?
2012-08-01T11:17:54  <antimatroid1> then iterate through them?
2012-08-01T11:18:02  <mcstar> the less they understand it the more they will think its magc
2012-08-01T11:18:05  <mcstar> ic*
2012-08-01T11:18:12  <mcstar> no
2012-08-01T11:18:30  <antimatroid1> what makes this perfect?
2012-08-01T11:18:56  <mcstar> its because you can use recursion very naturally, have lazy data structures, that can support lazy cyclic structures, and it is easy to define data types
2012-08-01T11:19:23  <mcstar> and the types guide you
2012-08-01T11:19:30  <antimatroid1> my experience with writing gui's might as well be nill
2012-08-01T11:19:42  <mcstar> what does this have to do with GUIs?
2012-08-01T11:19:54  <antimatroid1> how am i programming it without some kind of gui?
2012-08-01T11:20:04  <antimatroid1> i'm used to working with text
2012-08-01T11:20:05  <mcstar> you dont need gui
2012-08-01T11:20:09  <mcstar> you need to render it

2012-08-01T11:20:20  <antimatroid1> yeah, how do i render it?
2012-08-01T11:20:27  <mcstar> you can either make a graphviz script automatically, that will draw it for you
2012-08-01T11:20:40  <mcstar> or use a haskell graph library that produces the image
2012-08-01T11:20:44  <antimatroid1> hmmm okay, i will harrass you about this later
2012-08-01T11:20:52  <mcstar> or use other CASs

2012-08-01T12:07:21  <UVs> But I'm not sure I'll can code this way because

2012-08-01T12:07:22  <UVs> match nation with
2012-08-01T12:07:22  <UVs> helps me: I see what function accepts (and a type of it);  I see what is matched.
2012-08-01T12:07:22  <UVs> I hope I'll be able to understand easy code like this in future :)
2012-08-01T12:07:22  <UVs> let nation_to_string  = function

2012-08-01T12:08:49  <mcstar> what is the trouble with types?
2012-08-01T12:09:13  <UVs> So... did have you listened to The Dogma - Black Widow? :D
2012-08-01T12:09:25  <mcstar> no?
2012-08-01T12:09:37  <mcstar> -did
2012-08-01T12:09:49  <mcstar> or: did you ever listen to...
2012-08-01T12:11:10  <UVs> I think in big functions I can waste some time to understand what types of parameters it takes unless I write them in the function declaration like let myfun (a : integer) (b list of float) ... =
2012-08-01T12:11:46  <UVs> No, I thought you'll be interested :)
2012-08-01T12:13:26  <UVs> Interested after screenshot. It was on it. Hmm, my english tells me I have to shut up ad go to code tree :D

2012-08-01T12:37:31  <UVs> why is it bad to be honest?
2012-08-01T12:37:49  <mcstar> it is bad sometimes to be honest
2012-08-01T12:37:53  <mcstar> but i didnt mean that
2012-08-01T12:38:05  <mcstar> i meant the dogma black widow is pretty bad
2012-08-01T12:38:14  <UVs> OK :)
2012-08-01T12:39:54  <UVs> this is good to hear that. Because there are so often people say that they like things they really don't just to please you. And I hardly don't like when people do that.

2012-08-01T14:08:57  <mcstar> 109 ms to check all?
2012-08-01T14:09:01  <mcstar> or to load them?
2012-08-01T14:09:11  <mcstar> do you simply store the string?

2012-08-01T14:10:37  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-01T14:10:52  <mcstar> well, there are some other properties of the tree that beats a hashtable
2012-08-01T14:10:55  <mleise> and the trie @ 105ms (without post processing)
2012-08-01T14:11:07  <mleise> prefix trie that is
2012-08-01T14:11:09  <mcstar> for example, when a hashtable grows, it needs to rehash
2012-08-01T14:11:17  <mcstar> and it doesnt support partial lookups
2012-08-01T14:11:26  <mcstar> and a lot of advanced algorithms on the tree
2012-08-01T14:11:36  <mleise> that's right. it also cannot exit early like the trie
2012-08-01T14:11:51  <mleise> it has to compute the complete hash of the key-string
2012-08-01T14:12:11  <mleise> unless it uses only first and last character or something like that :p
