2010-10-07T00:00:12  <bhasker> another problem that i fixed was , i was using a staging planet concept but that would result in planets sending ships backwards at times
2010-10-07T00:00:20  <bhasker> if the staging was behind enemy front
2010-10-07T00:00:25  <bhasker> oops rather behind my front
2010-10-07T00:00:33  <bhasker> i fixed that so that planets don't send ships backwards
2010-10-07T00:01:00  <bhasker> otherwise i will have these huge fleets flying back right after capture
2010-10-07T00:01:04  <bhasker> and would lose the planet the next turn
2010-10-07T00:02:27  <sigh> why not just update your staging planet after you capture the new planet?
2010-10-07T00:03:00  <bhasker> well how i decide the staging planet is using average distancdes
2010-10-07T00:03:14  <bhasker> sometimes the newly acquire is necessarily not the best staging planet
2010-10-07T00:03:20  <sigh> ok, fair enough
2010-10-07T00:03:35  <bhasker> so basically not sending ships back fixes the problem
2010-10-07T00:03:41  <bhasker> it just does a simple check
2010-10-07T00:03:47  <bhasker> if enemy planet is closer than staging don't send
2010-10-07T00:03:48  <bhasker> back
2010-10-07T00:04:01  <sigh> I don't have explicit staging planets as such, so sorry if my question was naive :)
2010-10-07T00:04:01  <bhasker> just hold the ships, most probably next turn the attack can be launched straight from this planet
2010-10-07T00:04:14  <bhasker> well my staging planet is just the top of a routemap
2010-10-07T00:04:16  <bhasker> that i build
2010-10-07T00:04:20  <bhasker> based on distances
2010-10-07T00:04:30  <sigh> i see
2010-10-07T00:04:50  <bhasker> since that wil be the closest to the enemy and best located
2010-10-07T00:04:54  <bhasker> to attack most of his planets
2010-10-07T00:05:33  <sigh> do you care about the number of enemy units, or growth rates when choosing a staging planet
2010-10-07T00:05:46  <bhasker> no
2010-10-07T00:05:53  <bhasker> its purely a positional decision
2010-10-07T00:06:02  <sigh> yup, that makes sense
2010-10-07T00:06:23  <bhasker> its basically the planet that is at  ( avg_dist from my_planets+avg_dist from_enemy_planets)/2
2010-10-07T00:06:30  <bhasker> rather the least
2010-10-07T00:06:53  <sigh> my bot is does something much simpler, it just moves units forward
2010-10-07T00:07:14  <Zannick> my bot is very simple
2010-10-07T00:07:22  <bhasker> but which way is forward?
2010-10-07T00:07:29  <sigh> bhasker: closer to the enemy
2010-10-07T00:07:33  <Zannick> it calculates where it wants to go on the first turn, sends those ships, and then exits
2010-10-07T00:07:33  <bhasker> if an enemy attacks behind your lines?
2010-10-07T00:07:42  <bhasker> then which way is forward?
2010-10-07T00:08:05  <McLeopold> check out wormbot, it usually know which way is forward
2010-10-07T00:08:05  <sigh> closeness to the enemy is just measured by distance to closest enemy
2010-10-07T00:08:13  <sigh> so just sends to planets which are closer
2010-10-07T00:08:19  <bhasker> hmm i should try that maybe
2010-10-07T00:08:27  <bhasker> and ditch the complicated staging planet
2010-10-07T00:08:40  <McLeopold> it's got a simple forwarding system, distance to enemy
2010-10-07T00:08:55  <sigh> it's slightly more sophisticated than that, to stop it doing stupid things but that's the gist of it
2010-10-07T00:09:09  <McLeopold> bhasker: I fully believe staging planets will be needed
2010-10-07T00:09:22  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-07T00:09:27  <bhasker> brb

2010-10-07T00:09:42  <sigh> my bot implicitly creates staging planets

2010-10-07T00:11:12  <sigh> in my case, it was completely intended
2010-10-07T00:11:55  <sigh> although, unlike bhasker... my implicit staging planets are closest to my own planets rather than closest to enemy planets
2010-10-07T00:12:07  <sigh> ie, the planets which can be best fortified
2010-10-07T00:12:42  <McLeopold> mine just kind of happens
2010-10-07T00:12:42  <sigh> i feel like I am not explaining myself well
2010-10-07T00:13:00  <McLeopold> the back planets send stuff forward and the forward planets don't attack
2010-10-07T00:13:25  <sigh> yeah, but when you do that, the outcome is kind of obvious :)
2010-10-07T00:13:39  <McLeopold> which is?
2010-10-07T00:14:05  <McLeopold> it's not obvious to me
2010-10-07T00:14:13  <sigh> your ships accumulate on certain planets, which are in effect staging planets from which attacks are launched
2010-10-07T00:14:31  <McLeopold> yeah, but no special staging code
2010-10-07T00:14:54  <sigh> sure, it is emergent behaviour

2010-10-07T00:16:21  <sigh> I mean, the main way I see of doing ship redistribution while avoiding this effect is to have some weighting on planets and send ships in proportion
2010-10-07T00:16:26  <McLeopold> check out my attack at turn 20
2010-10-07T00:16:41  <sigh> which I think kcm1700 does?
2010-10-07T00:17:47  <McLeopold> kcm1700 just goes crazy
2010-10-07T00:17:55  <sigh> haha
2010-10-07T00:18:00  <sigh> yeah, that is a nice attack :)
2010-10-07T00:18:15  <McLeopold> I think he wins because nobody can predict his movements
2010-10-07T00:18:29  <sigh> hey, if it works for rock-paper-scissors :P
2010-10-07T00:20:03  <McLeopold> it's hard to tell how I won that game
2010-10-07T00:20:17  <Zannick> you had more ships at the end
2010-10-07T00:20:23  * Zannick is helpful :P
2010-10-07T00:20:40  <McLeopold> s/how/why/
2010-10-07T00:21:20  <sigh> McLeopold: you got better on growth with the 52 ship neutral?
2010-10-07T00:21:33  <sigh> which is very good positionally as well
2010-10-07T00:21:58  <McLeopold> our growth was even the whole game
2010-10-07T00:21:59  <McLeopold> mostly
2010-10-07T00:22:29  <McLeopold> I think if he followed up the attack at turn 51, he would have won
2010-10-07T00:22:38  <sigh> go to move 50... he has the entire center and you are STILL ahead on growth
2010-10-07T00:23:06  <sigh> and which that center planet your planets are better coordinated
2010-10-07T00:23:07  <McLeopold> move 54, 21-26 his favor
2010-10-07T00:23:32  <sigh> yeah, but he took a planet in your sphere of influence
2010-10-07T00:23:36  <sigh> which you quickly corrected
2010-10-07T00:24:01  <McLeopold> but, if he had sent more ships, he would have held longer
2010-10-07T00:24:10  <McLeopold> he takes a 49 neutral right after that
2010-10-07T00:24:22  <bhasker> back
2010-10-07T00:24:34  <McLeopold> bhasker: did you fix it
2010-10-07T00:24:51  <sigh> McLeopold: exactly the time you capitalise on the ship advantage and start taking the center
2010-10-07T00:25:13  <McLeopold> but I was down ships at that moment
2010-10-07T00:25:33  <sigh> not after his neutral capture
2010-10-07T00:25:41  <bhasker> not yet
2010-10-07T00:25:50  <bhasker> was busy with something else
2010-10-07T00:25:56  <bhasker> now to look at the knapsack code
2010-10-07T00:26:01  <bhasker> and see why its doing stupid stuff
2010-10-07T00:26:23  <sigh> ultimatly I think it is the the reason you won is because you took the 52-ship neutral and opponent didn't
2010-10-07T00:26:26  <McLeopold> hmm, it looks like that was it
2010-10-07T00:26:57  <sigh> that planet was the most important planet in the game, strategically... imo
2010-10-07T00:26:59  <McLeopold> it think it was that 49 neutral at turn 67
2010-10-07T00:27:17  <McLeopold> bhasker: that another time not to take a neutral
2010-10-07T00:27:44  <sigh> 49 was incidental, if opp hadn't done that you would have got ahead on growth
2010-10-07T00:27:50  <bhasker> oh you were asking if i fixed the neutral issue?
2010-10-07T00:28:02  <sigh> and your position meant that you could defend even with less ships
2010-10-07T00:29:21  <McLeopold> you'd think he'd spend an extra 4 ships for the 52
2010-10-07T00:30:22  <sigh>  I can see how it would come about, but I agree that it is not optimal
2010-10-07T00:30:27  <McLeopold> okay, time to fix my invalid orders

2010-10-07T00:39:35  <bhasker> mcleopold found the reason why my bot half acquired a neutral  , its a bug , i normally always try and complete the sync order as long as i have ships
2010-10-07T00:40:01  <bhasker> but when i added a heuristic i shadowed the check where i see if i have already committed to acquiring a neutral and not to bypass it
2010-10-07T00:40:10  <bhasker> so one turn it was to acquire neutrals
2010-10-07T00:40:15  <bhasker> and the next it became false
2010-10-07T00:40:21  <bhasker> and it never followed through
2010-10-07T00:41:19  <McLeopold> ouch
2010-10-07T00:41:34  <McLeopold> I'm not sure how to fix my partial neutral bug
2010-10-07T00:41:59  <bhasker> i wonder what i could have done better to detect this

2010-10-07T00:42:22  <McLeopold> ?
2010-10-07T00:42:29  <McLeopold> need a game link
2010-10-07T00:42:32  <bhasker> dammit
2010-10-07T00:42:36  <bhasker> i fail at copy paste
2010-10-07T00:42:41  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=349928
2010-10-07T00:42:55  <bhasker> he just sent everything at the central 1 size planet
2010-10-07T00:42:59  <bhasker> and i got overrun:-\
2010-10-07T00:43:08  <bhasker> since i had committed too many ships already
2010-10-07T00:44:08  <McLeopold> you could have taken back that center one
2010-10-07T00:44:28  <McLeopold> you funneled to the lowly growth 1
2010-10-07T00:45:02  <McLeopold> when you did take it back, you didn't follow it up
2010-10-07T00:45:22  <bhasker> i had no ships?
2010-10-07T00:45:37  <McLeopold> you had eleven left at 30 on the small one
2010-10-07T00:45:44  <McLeopold> 27
2010-10-07T00:45:46  <McLeopold> turn 48
2010-10-07T00:46:10  <McLeopold> with an extra 48 going to a growth 1 that should have been redirected to the center
2010-10-07T00:46:18  <bhasker> hmm true
2010-10-07T00:46:30  <bhasker> i guess the reason thats happening is because i try and reinforce my planets first
2010-10-07T00:46:38  <bhasker> before attacking
2010-10-07T00:46:41  <bhasker> that works sometimes
2010-10-07T00:46:44  <McLeopold> that center planet is you planet
2010-10-07T00:46:52  <McLeopold> THEY ARE ALL YOUR PLANETS
2010-10-07T00:47:05  <bhasker> well those that are actively producing planets for me
2010-10-07T00:47:06  <McLeopold> ^ that's important
2010-10-07T00:47:08  <bhasker> oops ships
2010-10-07T00:47:11  <bhasker> i guess yea
2010-10-07T00:47:16  <bhasker> i used to have a single priority queue
2010-10-07T00:47:31  <bhasker> but my planet value heuristic isnt good
2010-10-07T00:47:36  <bhasker> it does stupid things sometimes
2010-10-07T00:47:41  <McLeopold> 5 > 1 ?
2010-10-07T00:47:52  <bhasker> i guess so...
2010-10-07T00:47:56  <bhasker> oh well let me tinker with that
2010-10-07T00:48:06  <McLeopold> you have a very nice bot, I'm just critical
2010-10-07T00:48:14  <bhasker> usually when i have tried a single queue
2010-10-07T00:48:20  <bhasker> i end up launching attacks when i should be defending
2010-10-07T00:48:21  <bhasker> etc
2010-10-07T00:48:50  <bhasker> so i enforced a strict split, where i try and reinforce planets befrore acquiring neutrals or enemy planets
2010-10-07T00:48:56  <bhasker> or attacking enemy planets* rather
2010-10-07T00:49:05  <bhasker> it seems to work fine, except in situations like these
2010-10-07T00:49:15  <bhasker> where it saw a 1 growth planet under attack and committed ships to defense
2010-10-07T00:49:18  <bhasker> and had nothing left for offense
2010-10-07T00:49:37  <bhasker> probably i should just learn to abandon planets
2010-10-07T00:49:51  <bhasker> and just decide to attack something else, rather than try and save a 1 growth planet
2010-10-07T00:50:27  <McLeopold> well, it think it was you defended with too much
2010-10-07T00:51:24  <McLeopold> but, at some point, defending a 1 should come second to aquiring a 5
2010-10-07T00:51:40  <bhasker> yea.
2010-10-07T00:51:51  <bhasker> i need to develop better heuristics
2010-10-07T00:51:58  <bhasker> my current ones are rather crappy
2010-10-07T00:52:09  <bhasker> and make them more internally consistent

2010-10-07T01:39:03  <rebelxt_> yeah.. i'm playing others but not running into dmj's bots :(
2010-10-07T01:39:10  <rebelxt_> me? rebelxt101
2010-10-07T01:40:22  <McLeopold> a loss against flavor?
2010-10-07T01:40:50  <McLeopold> ( you can't fight for me now )
2010-10-07T01:41:50  <McLeopold> oh crap
2010-10-07T01:41:54  <rebelxt_> yeah that was a very ugly loss ;-) lots of room for improvement
2010-10-07T01:42:12  <McLeopold> my planets are sending fleets to themselves
2010-10-07T01:42:25  <McLeopold> wtf?
2010-10-07T01:42:28  <rebelxt_> haha
2010-10-07T01:43:21  <McLeopold> "I need help...oh here's a fleet"
2010-10-07T01:43:42  <McLeopold> It's like they are embezzeling the empire's funds...

2010-10-07T01:54:59  <rebelxt_> you beat dmj1.8 too earlier today. nice!
2010-10-07T01:56:26  <bhasker> yea that was weird
2010-10-07T01:56:31  <bhasker> his bot never went beyond the second planet
2010-10-07T01:56:37  <bhasker> and mine never went beyond the 3rd
2010-10-07T01:56:42  <bhasker> we both just sat in the corner
2010-10-07T01:56:45  <bhasker> and built up ships
2010-10-07T01:58:21  <rebelxt_> hehe my bot also loves to just sit and do nothing when it's behind by a planet ;-)
2010-10-07T01:59:04  <MarcAndrePC> anyone remember the number of a map in the starting 100 map where the 2 starting planet are very close to each other?
2010-10-07T01:59:07  <bhasker> most boring game ever

2010-10-07T02:00:05  <rebelxt_> bhasker: intense game
2010-10-07T02:00:12  <bhasker> :D
2010-10-07T02:00:16  <bhasker> so much action
2010-10-07T02:00:17  <bhasker> !
2010-10-07T02:01:03  <bhasker> at least it validates my first few steps,
2010-10-07T02:01:57  <bhasker> McLeopold another bot with the same explosion game http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=350904
2010-10-07T02:02:02  <bhasker> at turn 10 exactly
2010-10-07T02:02:35  <McLeopold> man, you try and tell people not to do that, but do the listen?
2010-10-07T02:02:45  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-07T02:02:50  <McLeopold> What's with the 4000 ships hanging out?
2010-10-07T02:03:31  <bhasker> my bot has a bug, sometimes it just decides that it needs X ships to take enemy
2010-10-07T02:03:35  <bhasker> and keeps sending X
2010-10-07T02:03:36  <McLeopold> Actually, my latest bot might do that too...
2010-10-07T02:03:49  <bhasker> assuming that X will win the planet
2010-10-07T02:03:50  <bhasker> and never sends more
2010-10-07T02:04:04  <bhasker> so sometimes i will control the whole map but keep sending 10 ships at a time to the last planet
2010-10-07T02:04:20  <bhasker> actually not to the last planet it usually happens when enemy has 2-3 left
2010-10-07T02:04:28  <bhasker> then i don't calculate the flow rate into the planet correctly
2010-10-07T02:04:37  <McLeopold> I looks like you don't account for his constant support
2010-10-07T02:04:50  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-07T02:04:57  <bhasker> i do,but i am underestimating it
2010-10-07T02:05:03  <bhasker> need to fix that
2010-10-07T02:05:54  <McLeopold> handling close starts will boost you up on the ranks
2010-10-07T02:06:08  <McLeopold> some top bots don't check for that
2010-10-07T02:07:00  <bhasker> well my bot has a problem too with close starts sometimes, where it will underestimate the nearby planet if the enemy expands too rapidly
2010-10-07T02:07:17  <bhasker> i think this version can make it to the top 40 at least
2010-10-07T02:07:21  <bhasker> my older version is at 77 odd
2010-10-07T02:07:26  <McLeopold> probably, it looks good
2010-10-07T02:07:40  <McLeopold> If it can beat ScotBot5, then it can
2010-10-07T02:07:59  <bhasker> lets see , still to be paired up against scotbot since i unified the queue
2010-10-07T02:08:07  <bhasker> last two matchups my bot got thrashed
2010-10-07T02:08:14  <McLeopold> I'll start it up again
2010-10-07T02:08:50  <McLeopold> a1k0n
2010-10-07T02:08:50  <bhasker> lets see if i can hit 400 Elo

2010-10-07T02:10:05  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-07T02:10:27  <bhasker> this 9-9 bot keeps thrashing me
2010-10-07T02:10:35  <McLeopold> another win...
2010-10-07T02:10:40  <McLeopold> 9-9 is good
2010-10-07T02:10:49  <bhasker> yea :-\
2010-10-07T02:11:00  <McLeopold> I have yet to finish a game with him.
2010-10-07T02:11:01  <sigh> 9-9 is FlagCapper
2010-10-07T02:11:14  <McLeopold> My current one keeps sending invalid orders
2010-10-07T02:11:21  <bhasker> ah
2010-10-07T02:11:39  <sigh> I've build checks into my output function to validate against invalid orders
2010-10-07T02:11:49  <sigh> locally it spits out big error messages
2010-10-07T02:12:07  <McLeopold> yea, i missed the "sending fleets to same planet" error
2010-10-07T02:12:17  <McLeopold> but now I need to know why I was trying that
2010-10-07T02:12:21  <sigh> :)
2010-10-07T02:12:48  <McLeopold> ouch, loss to 9-9
2010-10-07T02:13:00  <McLeopold> DaTwinkDaddy is up next...

2010-10-07T02:16:47  <bhasker> ouch
2010-10-07T02:16:53  <bhasker> he literally pounces
2010-10-07T02:17:09  <McLeopold> yea, pretty cool
2010-10-07T02:17:22  <bhasker> keep going up against DaTwink variants
2010-10-07T02:17:46  <bhasker> anyway time to catch some shut eye
2010-10-07T02:17:50  <bhasker> will just leave the bot running
2010-10-07T02:17:56  <bhasker> so hopefully we get some games
2010-10-07T02:18:26  <McLeopold> his bot looks dumb when it sits there, but when if it pounces, it's all over
2010-10-07T02:18:40  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-07T02:19:02  <bhasker> he just races through your planets before you can do anything
2010-10-07T02:19:12  <sigh> vortex is rwa
2010-10-07T02:19:29  <McLeopold> My bot expanded to fast.  One planet at a time, wait for num_ship to equalize, then do next planet
2010-10-07T02:19:42  <bhasker> yea i added some checks for that in my bot
2010-10-07T02:19:51  <sigh> DaTwinkDaddy just comes on here as DaTwinkDaddy i think
2010-10-07T02:19:53  <bhasker> basically it looks at how many ships enemy is committing to neutrals as well
2010-10-07T02:20:00  <bhasker> so i commit if he is committing
2010-10-07T02:20:05  <bhasker> kind of checks
2010-10-07T02:20:36  <bhasker> gah i just keep going up against him
2010-10-07T02:20:43  <bhasker> 7th or 8th game in a row
2010-10-07T02:21:07  <bhasker> he has like 4 different versions running
2010-10-07T02:21:10  <McLeopold> I'll step it up
2010-10-07T02:21:33  <McLeopold> 4 running at a time...
2010-10-07T02:21:44  <McLeopold> hopefully my bandwidth will hold...
2010-10-07T02:21:49  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-07T02:22:03  <bhasker> i run it off my laptop and i log like crazy
2010-10-07T02:22:09  <bhasker> so can't run more than 2 at a time
2010-10-07T02:22:16  <bhasker> i have 20.10/.9 running right now
2010-10-07T02:23:09  <McLeopold> my cpu fan just kicked on...
2010-10-07T02:23:42  <bhasker> hehe, maybe i should put my quadcore desktop to use
2010-10-07T02:23:54  <sigh> bhasker: hehe, that's what I use
2010-10-07T02:24:16  <sigh> I ssh into my desktop from my laptop, so I can work on my laptop and get the power of my desktop :D
2010-10-07T02:24:23  <bhasker> i will do that tomorrow
2010-10-07T02:25:19  <sigh> only trouble is that it means that I have to use the canvas visualiser and server the generated page to view it from my laptop :P
2010-10-07T02:25:26  <sigh> *serve
2010-10-07T02:25:35  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-07T02:25:43  <McLeopold> lots of games. no bhasker yet
2010-10-07T02:25:50  <bhasker> yea:(
2010-10-07T02:25:55  <bhasker> i am like 4 ranks behind scotbot
2010-10-07T02:26:06  <bhasker> and like 18 elo points
2010-10-07T02:26:33  <sigh> McLeopold: is scotbot aware of distance?
2010-10-07T02:26:33  <bhasker> i am just going up against datwink continously
2010-10-07T02:26:56  <McLeopold> kinda, on some things, but it will send attack across the whole field
2010-10-07T02:27:16  <sigh> so just restrict to stop neutrals being stolen?
2010-10-07T02:27:44  <McLeopold> I don't think v5 had that
2010-10-07T02:27:50  <McLeopold> I just beat 9-9

2010-10-07T06:38:05  <Migi32> 1. because a lot of people ask if the CPU we will be running on is 32 bit or 64 bit
2010-10-07T06:38:17  <Migi32> 2. because I want to know how much 1 second really is

2010-10-07T06:40:14  <Error323> 2. could you explain why you can't implement a timer urself?
2010-10-07T06:40:29  <Error323> 3. i don't see why its necessary
2010-10-07T06:40:35  <Error323> :)
2010-10-07T06:42:04  <Error323> Migi32: could you explain?
2010-10-07T06:42:14  <Migi32> is there anything left to explain?
2010-10-07T06:42:26  <Error323> yes
2010-10-07T06:42:29  <Error323> ^_^
2010-10-07T06:42:34  <Error323> sorry I'm prolly stupid
2010-10-07T06:42:59  <Error323> but if you use a timer, and check regularly, wouldn't that suffice?
2010-10-07T06:43:07  <Migi32> I can (and have) implemented a timer, but I still want to know how 1 second on the server compares to 1 second on my pc
2010-10-07T06:44:09  <drodil> it's the same 1 second
2010-10-07T06:44:11  <Migi32> also, in any sport there's standards for everything, like the air pressure / diameter of a football etc

2010-10-07T06:44:46  <Migi32> drodil, but it's not the same amount of CPU cycles
2010-10-07T06:45:19  <drodil> no it's not and it is not counted in CPU cycles but in real time
2010-10-07T06:46:37  <Migi32> exactly

2010-10-07T06:47:53  <drodil> so use gettimeofday() or similar for timing
2010-10-07T06:48:16  <Migi32> drodil, srsly I already have a timer. Let's just run your bot on an 8-bit gameboy and see how you do
2010-10-07T06:48:24  <Migi32> you'll also get 1 full second real-time
2010-10-07T06:48:33  *** ichti <ichti!~ichti@shop3.diku.dk> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2010-10-07T06:49:48  <drodil> if your timer is not based on CPU cycles, but to actual time in milliseconds or microseconds it should work, right ?
2010-10-07T06:50:20  <Error323> this is also what I don't get
2010-10-07T06:50:35  <Error323> just cut off the algorithm if the time is up
2010-10-07T06:50:44  <Error323> ?
2010-10-07T06:50:56  <Error323> also possible on the 8-bit gameboy
2010-10-07T06:51:12  <Error323> it'll probably win less though :P
2010-10-07T06:51:29  <Migi32> how many times do I have to keep repeating I already have a timer

2010-10-07T07:38:30  <delt0r> aerique, Also what one is JBOTManager.jar
2010-10-07T07:39:15  <delt0r> oh
2010-10-07T07:39:19  <delt0r> is it my one?
2010-10-07T07:39:24  <aerique> delt0r: that yours yes :)
2010-10-07T07:39:35  <delt0r> sure its not polished... but it shouldn't be flaky
2010-10-07T07:39:38  <dmj111> bhasker: nice :)  Still haven't gotten more aggressive about neutrals....

2010-10-07T07:39:47  <bhasker> :D
2010-10-07T07:39:54  <delt0r> whats the problem with it?
2010-10-07T07:40:09  <bhasker> i have been making my bot less aggresive still have one bug, where it will go after 3-4 neutrals at the same time
2010-10-07T07:40:15  <bhasker> in mid game
2010-10-07T07:40:19  <bhasker> need to fix that
2010-10-07T07:40:23  <aerique> delt0r: maybe it's my java version but it crashes now and then, the back / go to beginning buttons stop working now and then
2010-10-07T07:40:29  <dmj111> yeah... everything I try ends up doing the same thing.
2010-10-07T07:40:33  <delt0r> oh

2010-10-07T07:40:46  <delt0r> yea that a bug aerique that i fixed
2010-10-07T07:40:53  <delt0r> the "crashing"
2010-10-07T07:40:56  <aerique> delt0r: i really, really like its replay functionality though
2010-10-07T07:41:19  <delt0r> It only happens when you push << etc before play
2010-10-07T07:41:20  <bhasker> yup and that costs me quite a few games when i do that
2010-10-07T07:41:24  <delt0r> the counting from 0
2010-10-07T07:41:25  <delt0r> mm
2010-10-07T07:41:34  <delt0r> sounds like a n-1 error somewhere...

2010-10-07T07:44:33  <delt0r> well my IDE's
2010-10-07T07:44:39  <delt0r> my machines are fine
2010-10-07T07:44:41  <aerique> delt0r: same here, yours was easy to get going
2010-10-07T07:45:04  <delt0r> since i am writing java anyway... my own one works well for me
2010-10-07T07:45:37  <delt0r> But i will fix the crash issue and upload... If you are in here i'll beep. Otherwise I will just post to the forum thread

2010-10-07T07:46:43  <delt0r> I do realize its not very polished and its a bit quriky... but this is code I can't call a day job... so good enough is about as far as i get
2010-10-07T07:47:54  <aerique> delt0r: yeah, i understand that.  i'm glad you made it.  i was thinking about making one myself but i still wouldn't have a competitive bot if i had

2010-10-07T09:13:09  <Error323> return 0 is never called

2010-10-07T09:34:15  <Error323> jmcarthur: since the while loop isn't broken, I'll leak memory
2010-10-07T09:34:34  <Error323> so I have to delete everything every turn, and reallocate again
2010-10-07T09:34:40  <jmcarthur> umm
2010-10-07T09:34:54  <jmcarthur> leak memory? why are you leaking memory? i don't understand
2010-10-07T09:35:11  <krokokrusa> if the bot program is being killed, it can't leak memory
2010-10-07T09:35:16  <Bobng> ^

2010-10-07T09:35:37  <Error323> mmm
2010-10-07T09:35:58  <krokokrusa> if I understand Error323 correctly, his program exits when it performs while(true)
2010-10-07T09:36:12  <Error323> yes
2010-10-07T09:36:22  <Error323> without breaking the while loop
2010-10-07T09:36:26  <krokokrusa> all memory is returned to the OS when the process exits
2010-10-07T09:36:27  <Error323> it gets killed I think
2010-10-07T09:36:32  <jmcarthur> Error323: the OS reclaims resources whenever a process it killed. they are not gone

2010-10-07T09:37:01  <Error323> :(
2010-10-07T09:37:16  <Bobng> I don't think much code relating to this project is clean
2010-10-07T09:37:21  <Bobng> especially not the backend :)
2010-10-07T09:37:23  <jmcarthur> mine is pretty clean so far
2010-10-07T09:37:25  <krokokrusa> true :)
2010-10-07T09:37:31  <jmcarthur> no the backend has pretty fugly code
2010-10-07T09:37:42  <Error323> Why not send a terminal char :/
2010-10-07T09:37:45  * Bobng spies compile_anything
2010-10-07T09:37:48  <jmcarthur> Error323: why bother?
2010-10-07T09:38:14  <Error323> 1) I can profile with gprof
2010-10-07T09:38:20  <jmcarthur> Error323: the server doesn't want to have to wait around while a bot cleans up anyway
2010-10-07T09:38:21  <Error323> 2) memory gets deleted properly
2010-10-07T09:38:27  <jmcarthur> memory is freed anyway
2010-10-07T09:38:35  <jmcarthur> so your second point is meaningless
2010-10-07T09:38:47  <jmcarthur> as for profiling... you could just modify your local engine
2010-10-07T09:38:47  <Bobng> Error323: what would be the point? The term char would be instantly followed by a terminate signal
2010-10-07T09:38:50  <jmcarthur> it would be easy

2010-10-07T09:39:55  <Bobng> you would just be freeing memory that would be freed anyway

2010-10-07T09:51:01  <mrWatson> lol how many times ago i used irc
2010-10-07T09:51:07  <jmcarthur> Bobng: i think if you have access to these VPSs you're talking about then you would have to be disqualified from the contest in order for the contest to use them :\
2010-10-07T09:51:23  <Bobng> Thats fine, I haven't submitted a bot
2010-10-07T09:51:32  <Bobng> I submitted a few backend patches instead
2010-10-07T09:51:35  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-10-07T09:51:38  <mrWatson> this is so much like twitter
2010-10-07T09:51:45  <jmcarthur> mrWatson: ....
2010-10-07T09:52:12  <Bobng> I wouldn't compare twitter to IRC.
2010-10-07T09:52:30  <jmcarthur> i don't really see much in common between the two, for sure
2010-10-07T09:53:06  <krokokrusa> typical message is less than 140 chars? :)
2010-10-07T09:53:15  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-10-07T09:53:20  <Naktibalda> but a limit is 300 :)
2010-10-07T09:53:24  <Bobng> But anyway jmcarthur, I wouldn't have access to the VPSs, I would simply host them
2010-10-07T09:53:36  <mrWatson> twitter is funny web 2.0 slick and sexy irc wrapper
2010-10-07T09:53:36  <Bobng> out of interest would that still disqualify me?
2010-10-07T09:54:25  <Bobng> Nah, twitter is facebook without any of the interesting features

2010-10-07T12:04:40  <McLeopold> It's flawed to assume every bot becomes perfect after 200 turns.
2010-10-07T12:05:19  <jmcarthur> a bot is flawed if it doesn't win by the turn limit :P

2010-10-07T12:07:07  <cfaftw> haha
2010-10-07T12:07:13  <McLeopold> embarrasing

2010-10-07T12:14:33  <cfaftw> probably not going to get to work on it until this evening
2010-10-07T12:14:36  <McLeopold> hmm... older version?  from source control?
2010-10-07T12:14:55  <cfaftw> yeah i guess i could throw up what's been playing
2010-10-07T12:16:52  <cfaftw> is there a way to turn off those move messages with the Java TCP client?
2010-10-07T12:17:10  <cfaftw> i'm in windows right now, no cygwin, have to use the java tcp client
2010-10-07T12:17:48  <cfaftw> nvm... he released the source too
2010-10-07T12:17:51  <cfaftw> i'll just squelch it
2010-10-07T12:18:04  <McLeopold> you can redirect output
2010-10-07T12:19:02  <cfaftw> but i want to use it with some other dude's automated TCP python script
2010-10-07T12:19:11  <cfaftw> it parses output, but it's based on the C TCP client
2010-10-07T12:19:29  <cfaftw> i could ignore the output, but if i can have the parsing, i'd like it

2010-10-07T12:21:23  <cfaftw> removed = fixed
2010-10-07T12:21:30  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: so you have a scottish looking nick and your name is scott?
2010-10-07T12:21:47  <McLeopold> jmcarthur, you're a smart man
2010-10-07T12:21:47  <jmcarthur> is your nick your last name?
2010-10-07T12:22:01  <McLeopold> No, Hamilton, but still scottish.
2010-10-07T12:22:04  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-10-07T12:22:20  <McLeopold> Leopold is more german.
2010-10-07T12:22:21  <jmcarthur> interesting name, in that case. i don't know any other scots names scot
2010-10-07T12:22:43  <jmcarthur> *named scott
2010-10-07T12:24:04  <Migi32> McLeopold, what did you change to it?
2010-10-07T12:24:07  <Migi32> that made it play bad
2010-10-07T12:24:11  <jmcarthur> yeah Leopold could be german, but McLeopold still looks very scottish to me. maybe i'm seeing it the way i see McLeod
2010-10-07T12:24:36  <McLeopold> McLeod is way different from McLeopold
2010-10-07T12:24:47  <McLeopold> Leopold means "prince of the people"
2010-10-07T12:24:53  <McLeopold> Leod means "Ugly"
2010-10-07T12:24:56  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-10-07T12:25:14  <jmcarthur> such a prince could be ugly
2010-10-07T12:25:28  <McLeopold> >:|
2010-10-07T12:26:14  <McLeopold> So, thanks goodness for version control, because I can now look at the diffs from a few days ago. :)
2010-10-07T12:28:07  * jmcarthur has the "privilege" of having ancestors named "Thomas Jefferson McArthur", "Christopher Columbus McArthur", and "Benjamin Franklin McArthur"
2010-10-07T12:28:36  <jmcarthur> and "John Franklin McArthur"
2010-10-07T12:29:59  <cfaftw> i'm... not using version control
2010-10-07T12:30:03  <cfaftw> x_x
2010-10-07T12:30:09  <McLeopold> start now
2010-10-07T12:30:14  <McLeopold> it's easy!
2010-10-07T12:30:18  <cfaftw> i'm basically using dropbox
2010-10-07T12:30:41  <McLeopold> I've got my own svn install
2010-10-07T12:30:55  <jmcarthur> distributed is even easier to get started with
2010-10-07T12:31:19  <McLeopold> meh, it's all the same as long as you have access
2010-10-07T12:31:52  <jmcarthur> i just mean in that you can just type `<vcs> init` and go. no need for a server
2010-10-07T12:33:00  <cfaftw> what about git?
2010-10-07T12:33:03  <jmcarthur> i don't think it's all the same though
2010-10-07T12:33:16  <jmcarthur> git has a fairly complicated UI, but the basics are very simple
2010-10-07T12:33:48  <jmcarthur> init, add, and commit are the important ones
2010-10-07T12:34:12  <amstan_> http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/unix/unix103.html
2010-10-07T12:35:04  * krokokrusa using git completely w/o UI
2010-10-07T12:35:13  <jmcarthur> there are no really great intro tutorials for darcs :(
2010-10-07T12:35:19  <amstan_> krokokrusa: so.. you edit files manually?
2010-10-07T12:35:21  <jmcarthur> krokokrusa: you are using a UI even if it's not a GUI
2010-10-07T12:35:22  <cfaftw> i mostly use svn without a ui right now
2010-10-07T12:35:28  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: ^^
2010-10-07T12:35:31  <McLeopold> I develop in eclipse, so I don't really do command line stuff.
2010-10-07T12:35:36  <amstan_> UI!=GUI
2010-10-07T12:35:59  <krokokrusa> jmcarthur: oh, you are right :)
2010-10-07T12:36:09  * krokokrusa is using git w/o *G*UI
2010-10-07T12:36:18  <krokokrusa> "alias.lol=log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --graph --decorate --color --all" FTW
2010-10-07T12:36:19  <jmcarthur> i hate GUI wrappers for version control
2010-10-07T12:36:23  <jmcarthur> i haven't seen one i liked, anyway
2010-10-07T12:36:35  <krokokrusa> amstan_: yes, manually! you? :)
2010-10-07T12:36:41  <krokokrusa> automated the process? :)
2010-10-07T12:36:50  <McLeopold> I don't do any branching or merging, so it works.
2010-10-07T12:37:11  <amstan_> i'm just saying.. the only way to use git without an ui is to do git's job manually on those object files
2010-10-07T12:37:35  <krokokrusa> agreed
2010-10-07T12:37:46  <jmcarthur> even that has a UI
2010-10-07T12:37:48  <krokokrusa> my bad confusing ui with gui
2010-10-07T12:37:54  <jmcarthur> it's just not git
2010-10-07T12:38:35  <cfaftw> ok guys... playing minecraft with a friend for lunch

2010-10-07T12:40:38  <Gorovkhaia2> I never managed to convince other people involved

2010-10-07T12:44:23  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, that's unfortunate :\
2010-10-07T12:44:38  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: nah, it's good that they are optimizing for price
2010-10-07T12:44:50  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: it also means if they would just raise some stinking money we could get more matches
2010-10-07T12:45:11  <jmcarthur> hmm... it occurs to me that that could be a way to motivate some donations. donators could get some priority matches or something
2010-10-07T12:45:12  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, isn't google sponsoring the contest? i feel like the biggest sponsor need is money for servers
2010-10-07T12:45:22  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: no, google doesn't really have much to do with it
2010-10-07T12:45:52  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: the name google is just being "used with permission" and that's about the extent of the sponsorship. i kind of disagree with this situation
2010-10-07T12:46:10  <Accoun> jmcarthur> double send from A to B cause error on ofocial server?
2010-10-07T12:46:12  <jmcarthur> disagree that we should be using google's name without actual sponsorship, that is
2010-10-07T12:46:30  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, if that's the case, i agree that they shouldn't use google's name without any type of real sponsorship
2010-10-07T12:46:31  <jmcarthur> Accoun: i have no idea. i don't really mess with the engine or server
2010-10-07T12:46:46  <Janzert> Accoun: only if it would cause more ships than are available on A to be sent
2010-10-07T12:47:00  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, how much money do they have allocated toward the servers now?
2010-10-07T12:47:02  <Janzert> The two fleets will be combined by the server though
2010-10-07T12:47:10  <jmcarthur> cfaftw: might need to ask j3camero that later

2010-10-07T14:01:54  <agweber> Oh? That's annoying. Now I have to learn to work outside my go function =P
2010-10-07T14:02:26  <McLeopold> agweber: what language?
2010-10-07T14:02:37  <agweber> I went with Java just because it worked for me
2010-10-07T14:05:43  <ShaneHudson> same, for applications I tend to use C# but couldnt figure it out for this lol
2010-10-07T14:06:13  <agweber> Well, my programming experience is pretty much limited to a tiny bit in school years ago and from game editors
2010-10-07T14:06:45  <agweber> I wanted to try with python originally, not that sure why, but I couldn't quite get it working so I fell back to java because the tut was in java.
2010-10-07T14:06:57  <agweber> And it worked, so I just went from there

2010-10-07T14:11:47  <agweber> Now if the target was to lose the quickest I'd be all over that
2010-10-07T14:11:49  <amstan> someone should make a bot that tries to make alliances with other bots
2010-10-07T14:11:58  <amstan> here! let's just draw!
2010-10-07T14:12:15  <agweber> How about a mimic bot?
2010-10-07T14:12:22  <agweber> If that maps are all symmetrical
2010-10-07T14:12:33  <wh1teside> agweber: sounds like you need a minus sign in front of whatever number your calculation spits out
2010-10-07T14:12:56  <Janzert> agweber: it can only mimic with a one move delay
2010-10-07T14:13:07  <agweber> Yeah, I was thinking of that.
2010-10-07T14:13:18  <agweber> It'd never win if it depended on being behind

2010-10-07T14:19:13  <bhasker> q) what do you guys think of a kamikaze strategy
2010-10-07T14:19:29  <bhasker> i am wondering if in games where you are like behind by 1 production and slowly losing
2010-10-07T14:19:41  <bhasker> if it would be a better strategy to just launch all the ships at enemy planets
2010-10-07T14:20:02  <bhasker> i wonder if that will work
2010-10-07T14:20:23  <bhasker> like slam one planet with all the ships
2010-10-07T14:20:29  <bhasker> and cascade from there
2010-10-07T14:23:04  <agweber> I'd say it's worth a try.. I see a lot of upper level games that just get stuck in a bind with one guy slightly on top, at which point the other will have to try something, otherwise it'd lose by default.

2010-10-07T14:23:30  <bhasker> by like 30 ships or something
2010-10-07T14:23:34  <bhasker> sometimes by even less
2010-10-07T14:23:46  <agweber> Maybe have your largest planets send about 75% of their forces, and wait for them to try to stockpile their own forces for defense, and then take out any weakened planets
2010-10-07T14:23:55  <agweber> Be worth a shot imo

2010-10-07T14:25:04  <jmcarthur> it's not much of a kamikaze if you're destined to die anyway :P
2010-10-07T14:25:49  <agweber> It's kamikaze in the sense you're crashing your plane instead of flying circles around the harbour while they're blasting away at you.

2010-10-07T15:10:02  <Migi32> JamesMG, my first game wasn't against you, it was against flavor.131_02 and it won o.O *blink* o.O
2010-10-07T15:10:11  <JamesMG> Oh, hah
2010-10-07T15:10:22  <McLeopold> game link?
2010-10-07T15:10:37  <JamesMG> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=360181
2010-10-07T15:11:03  <JamesMG> think it had a lot to do with the map
2010-10-07T15:12:02  <Migi32> probably. It lost all games since.
2010-10-07T15:12:57  <McLeopold> Migi32: you should put in some simple defense.
2010-10-07T15:13:04  <McLeopold> That's what I did with WormBot.
2010-10-07T15:13:20  <McLeopold> Just enough to make sure you survive a little longer.
2010-10-07T15:14:18  <Migi32> McLeopold, there is a little bit of defence, it calculates the minimum number of ships required to hold the incoming fleets and if positive will only send out that many
2010-10-07T15:14:25  <Migi32> very basic ofc
2010-10-07T15:14:53  <McLeopold> Yes, the next step would be to see if it will lose the planet, and send the right amount from the closest friendly
2010-10-07T15:15:05  <Migi32> counterclockwise? no wai
2010-10-07T15:15:08  <Migi32> :P
2010-10-07T15:15:20  <McLeopold> It would slow the vortex, but at least it would survive for people to see it.
2010-10-07T15:15:38  <Migi32> ok ok you have a point :)
2010-10-07T15:15:52  <McLeopold> Or, maybe just the back planets don't forward.
2010-10-07T15:16:11  <McLeopold> The enemy would take the next to back, then the back could reclaim it.
2010-10-07T15:16:30  <McLeopold> Well, you should at least try it to see the affect.
2010-10-07T15:16:47  <McLeopold> I've got a "defense" snippet of code I can drop in all my bots.
2010-10-07T15:18:35  <jmcarthur> you could make is a clockwise vortex in the center and a counterclockwise one on the outside
2010-10-07T15:18:38  <jmcarthur> *make it
2010-10-07T15:18:48  <jmcarthur> then you could do some defense, maybe
2010-10-07T15:18:57  <jmcarthur> maybe routing ships through the center
2010-10-07T15:19:07  <McLeopold> yeah, use the center planets for defense only?
2010-10-07T15:19:35  <jmcarthur> it would end up looking like a few swirling eddies, i think
2010-10-07T15:20:48  <Migi32> I have some snippets of code as well, maybe with the neutral stealing one I can get it to take the center

2010-10-07T15:28:30  <Migi32> jmcarthur, are you converting existing code or writing your own from scratch?
2010-10-07T15:29:11  <jmcarthur> my own. i would have just used a C binding, but i think the overhead from the FFI would actually outweigh what might otherwise have been a performance improvement
2010-10-07T15:29:38  <jmcarthur> plus this way it's easier to interface with the rest of my code

2010-10-07T16:00:36  <nullkuhl> Janzert: yes but i meant for the desktop application, there is this visualizer that comes with the starter packages , the one i use is the java package and its visualizer outputs : Turn1 .... Turn N , then output Player X wins

2010-10-07T16:36:46  <Janzert> I wonder if j3camero would consider putting a paypal donation button on the front page. A $5 donation would pay for a server to run games on for around 3 days.
2010-10-07T16:39:33  <Migi32> isn't it sponsored by google?

2010-10-07T16:40:18  <Janzert> sponsored by google basically just means we can use their name I believe

2010-10-07T17:35:59  <FlagCapper> Do you have something that checks for timeouts anyway? The server may simply be overloaded
2010-10-07T17:36:05  <FlagCapper> Yup
2010-10-07T17:36:24  <bhasker> not really and my bot was running without a single timeout since last few days
2010-10-07T17:36:31  <bhasker> my latest version isnt that much different
2010-10-07T17:36:35  <bhasker> to have a timeout in the middle
2010-10-07T17:41:28  <Migi32> jmcarthur, ok that kinda sucks. But I do have to admit that because it's a "Google" AI challenge my first impression was a lot better
2010-10-07T17:42:18  <Migi32> if it were just called a "University Of Waterloo AI Challenge" then I'd have thought there'd be a lot of trouble I'd have to go through to get started
2010-10-07T17:43:05  <Migi32> so in some way, even if they pay nothing I think it's better to leave it
2010-10-07T17:43:09  <Migi32> imho
2010-10-07T17:43:10  <Zannick> indeed, i am very disappointed that google isn't actually involved with it

2010-10-07T18:04:56  <McLeopold> Why the fuss about Google?
2010-10-07T18:05:20  <McLeopold> Did the name "Google" make you think it would be popular or well funded?
2010-10-07T18:05:40  <McLeopold> It may not be well funded, but it is popular.
2010-10-07T18:05:49  <McLeopold> Thanks to the Google name.
2010-10-07T18:06:17  <ShaneHudson> Yes the google name helped a lot (even if it was just to entice me :D)
2010-10-07T18:07:02  <Migi32> McLeopold, the Google name gave me the impression of being well-funded, professional and not hard to get into
2010-10-07T18:07:09  <McLeopold> As long as it entices everyone.
2010-10-07T18:07:22  <McLeopold> Migi32: it wasn't hard to get into.  The starter packages are nice.
2010-10-07T18:07:28  <JamesMG> it enticed me, now I'm having too much fun to be mad about it
2010-10-07T18:07:32  <McLeopold> The community is big enough to help people.
2010-10-07T18:07:33  <ShaneHudson> Have you tried getting funding from google?
2010-10-07T18:07:48  <Migi32> McLeopold, the professional and not hard to get into parts turned out to be true
2010-10-07T18:08:08  <Zannick> i have no idea how to go about doing that, and j3camero supposedly had other contacts
2010-10-07T18:08:24  <Migi32> did the Tron contest get money?
2010-10-07T18:09:42  <Zannick> i don't think google's ever been financially involved
2010-10-07T18:11:16  <McLeopold> I think the organizers are doing a great job.  Even though there is a lot of whining about not enough games.
2010-10-07T18:11:32  <McLeopold> It's just impatience.

2010-10-07T18:12:09  <McLeopold> It really doesn't matter what rank you bot hits.  If you see 1 loss, you have something to analyze and improve.
2010-10-07T18:18:00  <davidjliu> heh, how about the idea that new bots keep playing fairly quickly until they get a loss then?
2010-10-07T18:18:19  <sigh> or until they reach #1 :P
2010-10-07T18:18:33  <davidjliu> well... heh, yeah

2010-10-07T18:22:53  <McLeopold> davidjliu: with using bayeselo, they could seed bots with large confidence intervals (or not much confidence in current rank)
2010-10-07T18:23:12  <McLeopold> but then you need to also allow established bots to play some to
2010-10-07T18:23:54  <McLeopold> right now its whoever played last, which does favor new bots for the first match
2010-10-07T18:24:39  <FlagCapper> Why not initially seed a bot based on someone's previous submission?
2010-10-07T18:25:19  <FlagCapper> So if I was in say, 50th with my last entry don't match me up with someone in 2000th on the first game

2010-10-07T21:02:03  <dmj111> no... I just added, in dmj1.9, to defend against possible all out attacks.
2010-10-07T21:02:05  <bhasker> so ..i replaced my complicated planet selection heuristic with a simple growth rate based one and my bot seems to do better
2010-10-07T21:02:05  <sigh> my bot doesn't send out ships if someone acting like ragebot would screw things up
2010-10-07T21:02:06  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-07T21:02:37  <dmj111> But, in this one map, there was 100 incoming.  I could have defended, but instead took a nearby neutral.

2010-10-07T21:03:11  <bhasker> yea i am thinking i will rewrite with simple heuristics
2010-10-07T21:03:14  <bhasker> for planet selection
2010-10-07T21:03:23  <bhasker> and just have a good starting strategy
2010-10-07T21:03:34  <dmj111> bhasker: nice. I really need to get better at neutrals .
2010-10-07T21:03:44  <sigh> my evaluation is a simple function of cost, distance and growth
2010-10-07T21:03:54  <bhasker> thanks dmj, though my  bot does stupid things
2010-10-07T21:03:55  <sigh> the only complicated part is determining the "cost"
2010-10-07T21:03:57  <bhasker> sometimes it will beat your bot
2010-10-07T21:04:04  <bhasker> othertimes it will go lose to a -200 elo bot
2010-10-07T21:04:05  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-07T21:06:57  <dmj111> woot ... 100/100 on ragebot.  finally.
2010-10-07T21:08:23  <sigh> @yay
2010-10-07T21:08:23  <contestbot> Double rainbow all the way!
2010-10-07T21:08:30  <dmj111> i love bots.
2010-10-07T21:08:42  <dmj111> even you, contestbot.

2010-10-07T23:53:35  <dmj111> submitted dmj1.9.  probably not much better than what was there... but I wanted to see what it does.
2010-10-07T23:54:47  <bhasker> my latest submission just keeps timing out on the official server
2010-10-07T23:54:53  <bhasker> :-\

2010-10-07T23:55:26  <dmj111> yuck.
2010-10-07T23:56:00  <dmj111> you made me check.... I wasn't sure I _even_ had a safety in there for timeouts.
2010-10-07T23:56:16  <dmj111> (not that _that_ is your problem... I think there are server issues now, right?)
2010-10-07T23:57:21  <bhasker> i think so
2010-10-07T23:57:28  <bhasker> cause i haven't had a single timeout on the tcp sever
2010-10-07T23:57:30  <bhasker> server*
2010-10-07T23:57:32  <bhasker> and from my log
2010-10-07T23:57:38  <bhasker> i see that my turns don't take more than 200 ms
2010-10-07T23:57:39  <bhasker> at most

2010-10-07T23:58:09  <bhasker> i don't even have any expensive loops in my code
2010-10-07T23:58:14  <bhasker> its mostly just queues and walking queues
2010-10-07T23:58:17  <dmj111> I am sure that is frustrating.
2010-10-07T23:59:21  <bhasker> i replaced my complicated heuristic for planets with a simple one and it works much better
2010-10-07T23:59:43  <dmj111> that's good.  oh yeah.... we looked at that beating you gave me earlier :)
