2011-06-07T00:03:18  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold I've been looking at JSkills but it doesn't seem like it is even compilable, at least with the java 1.6.0
2011-06-07T00:03:18  <contestbot> janzert: I think that worked...
2011-06-07T00:07:37  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold ahh, just found a pre-built jar of a slightly older version of JSkills. I'll try working from that.

2011-06-07T04:03:05  <janzert> I think I misunderstood, the error is displayed immediately on the resulting page when you try and upload or it shows up in the submission list on the profile page?
2011-06-07T04:04:17  <aerique> it shows after pressing upload (but it takes 15 / 30 seconds, while a succesful upload is pretty much immediate)
2011-06-07T04:04:46  <janzert> yeah, that's really weird then
2011-06-07T04:05:31  <janzert> save the current one, but could you try recreating the starter bot archive at say a different compression level
2011-06-07T04:05:49  <aerique> sure
2011-06-07T04:05:50  <janzert> I'm wondering if it's some specific byte sequence in the file
2011-06-07T04:06:27  <janzert> or maybe better try it with the same file but a different browser
2011-06-07T04:07:24  <aerique> i uploaded a tar.gz instead of a .zip and it worked
2011-06-07T04:07:35  <janzert> because actually I don't see how the upload file could effect a post field unless either browser or server are doing an encoding or decoding wrong
2011-06-07T04:07:40  <aerique> i'll try the malfunctioning zip in chrome now
2011-06-07T04:07:48  <janzert> thanks
2011-06-07T04:11:46  <aerique> janzert: in chrome with the "lispstaerbot" account the malfunctioning zip didn't work either but the .tar.gz one did
2011-06-07T04:12:06  <janzert> so it doesn't work with either chrome or ?
2011-06-07T04:12:14  <aerique> i've ran out of browsers on this machine now :)
2011-06-07T04:12:28  <aerique> nope, chrome does the same thing as ff
2011-06-07T04:12:36  <aerique> but the workaround does work
2011-06-07T04:13:02  <janzert> ok FF, so a completely different vintage than Chrome ;)
2011-06-07T04:13:12  <janzert> yeah, seems like it must be server side
2011-06-07T04:13:29  <aerique> so thanks for that :)  shall i edit the error message a little with your workaround?
2011-06-07T04:13:37  <janzert> is there somewhere publicly accessible you could upload the zip?
2011-06-07T04:13:58  <aerique> it's just the zip from http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/starter_packages.php
2011-06-07T04:14:01  <janzert> no, this is something that really shouldn't be able to happen
2011-06-07T04:14:02  <aerique> for common lisp
2011-06-07T04:14:17  <aerique> now that you mention it, i'll go check the zip for errors
2011-06-07T04:16:33  <aerique> no errors locally, but perhaps it does give errors on the server?
2011-06-07T04:17:03  <janzert> hmm, not an error but it really shouldn't contain the bot binary
2011-06-07T04:17:12  <aerique> does it?
2011-06-07T04:17:20  <janzert> and just confirmed that it causes the same error when I try and upload it
2011-06-07T04:17:29  <aerique> you're right
2011-06-07T04:17:33  <aerique> i missed that :)
2011-06-07T04:17:46  <janzert> so almost certainly something server side and not in the network path either
2011-06-07T04:18:13  <aerique> are there any size limits when unpacking?
2011-06-07T04:18:31  <aerique> the binary's pretty big and it shouldn't be there
2011-06-07T04:18:34  <janzert> not sure, but the error is way before that
2011-06-07T04:19:34  <janzert> for kicks and giggles going to try uploading with IE once :P

2011-06-07T04:20:19  * janzert has both running :/
2011-06-07T04:22:14  <aerique> why would the binary be in the starter package?  running make in ants/dist/starter_bots doesn't put it there
2011-06-07T04:23:13  <aerique> actually, i should get back to work, sorry :-(  thanks for the workaround
2011-06-07T04:23:32  <janzert> probably a quirk of the beta server, my guess is someone happened to build the bot before building the starter packages
2011-06-07T04:23:45  <janzert> thanks for the testing and finding a problem
2011-06-07T04:24:25  <janzert> and IE causes the same error, so pretty positively a server side error
2011-06-07T04:24:57  <aerique> my bet's on the binary and the size of the starter package
2011-06-07T04:25:42  <janzert> not the size but somehow the actual binary, but really the way php works its not suppose to allow this to happen

2011-06-07T04:38:10  <janzert> I don't expect more than 15 at the very most though
2011-06-07T04:38:50  <janzert> and probably somewhere between 9 and 12 is the most likely maximum
2011-06-07T04:38:55  <janzert> minimum of course is 2
2011-06-07T04:39:35  <UncleVasya> I have an idea for visualizer.

2011-06-07T04:44:47  <janzert> yes, Frontier handles pretty much all the visualizer development
2011-06-07T04:46:15  <UncleVasya> I'll try to use contestbot.

2011-06-07T05:30:38  <xQuasar> Ok what’s the new value?
2011-06-07T05:30:45  <antimatroid> can anyone remember the current value?
2011-06-07T05:30:59  <antimatroid> i know we have spawn2 = 1, attack2 = 4
2011-06-07T05:31:08  <xQuasar> I think it should be part of the initial values sent to the clients
2011-06-07T05:31:10  <antimatroid> 53 rings a bell, but i could be wrong
2011-06-07T05:31:12  <antimatroid> it is

2011-06-07T05:32:03  <xQuasar> what about the .3?
2011-06-07T05:32:12  <antimatroid> the reason we sent it squared is so that we don't have rounding errors
2011-06-07T05:32:16  <antimatroid> send*
2011-06-07T05:32:23  <antimatroid> or have people  having to read doubles/etc.
2011-06-07T05:33:52  <xQuasar> antimatroid: Ok so what about the extra decimal values then? Is it rounded?
2011-06-07T05:34:01  <xQuasar> can you see a square if you can see 0.3 into it?
2011-06-07T05:34:15  <antimatroid> look at the distance metric
2011-06-07T05:34:34  <janzert> all the squared radius' we use will be integral values
2011-06-07T05:34:39  <UncleVasya> <janzert> hmm... why contestbot said nothing to the Frontier? Or he did it in private?
2011-06-07T05:34:49  <antimatroid> if you have an ant at aloc,then it can see any loc where dist(aloc, loc) <= sqrt(vision2)
2011-06-07T05:35:16  <janzert> it sends the "later tell" message by private message, yes
2011-06-07T05:36:20  <Frontier> xQuasar: You don't actually need to use the sqrt() of a radius² value. You'll only need comparisons à la "is it within range", so you can do: row²+col² <= viewradius²
2011-06-07T05:36:42  <antimatroid> yeah, you can square the distance metric locally if you want
2011-06-07T05:36:58  <antimatroid> but the distances aren't intuitive then, so it's easier to officially use the metric we are ;)
2011-06-07T05:38:07  <antimatroid> no fog of war is equivalent to having fog of war with the discrete metric and vision2 >=1
2011-06-07T05:40:25  <Frontier> UncleVasya: contestbot always opens a private chat. I don't think what you want can easily be done. If 3 bots attack each other one bot may be killed by multiple bots of multiple players
2011-06-07T05:40:56  <UncleVasya> ok
2011-06-07T05:41:13  <Frontier> Probably 'damage absorbed' would work somehow.

2011-06-07T05:46:36  <UncleVasya> *and after that...
2011-06-07T05:48:26  <UncleVasya> What is the point to watch games in progress? I see only an adrenaline because you do not know who will win the fight.
2011-06-07T05:50:35  <Frontier> UncleVasya: 1. We had that feature in the last contest and 2. you can stop the engine when you see that your bot doesn't do what you want
2011-06-07T05:51:41  <Frontier> Especially when the bots run slow and there are more than 3 players and lots of turns it is good to see what is going on.
2011-06-07T05:54:56  <UncleVasya> I've got it.
2011-06-07T05:56:44  <UncleVasya> Interesting bot to watch when he have enough ants: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=16262

2011-06-07T06:30:20  <antimatroid> Frontier: Mcleopold started a bug thing because of colliding ants not being obvious to him
2011-06-07T06:30:36  <antimatroid> that might say a lot about what others are going to see, is it possible to make it more obvious when ants die from colliding?
2011-06-07T06:33:36  <Frontier> Any ideas on how it could be visualized?
2011-06-07T06:34:31  <antimatroid> a cross on the square?
2011-06-07T06:38:34  <locutus2> Has already someone tested the stability of the trueskill rating by bringing two identical bots on the server?
2011-06-07T06:39:33  <locutus2> If not and its allowed i create a second account and load my bot on this too

2011-06-07T06:44:53  <locutus2> ok i make it so!
2011-06-07T06:45:53  <locutus2> it would be interresting clone bots of different skill levels par example top, middle, bottom
2011-06-07T06:47:08  <locutus2> because i think in the middle of the field the instability highest

2011-06-07T11:28:25  <UncleVasya> When people will end up with food gathering algoritms they will focuse on the fight. And instead of watching your bot's every move you can look at this value and compare to the value of ypur opponents.
2011-06-07T11:29:28  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/151 this issue tracks extra stats that we want, add your ideas to this issue
2011-06-07T11:29:35  <UncleVasya> you can name it "Tactical score"
2011-06-07T11:29:48  <McLeopold> I called it kill ratio

2011-06-07T11:30:37  <McLeopold> This means playgame.py needs to be modified to capture the replay data and interject the extra bot program name into the json

2011-06-07T12:01:44  <stocha> (crashed) Could not create the Java virtual machine.
2011-06-07T12:01:52  <stocha> sometime there is no message at all.
2011-06-07T12:02:01  <stocha> what to make out of it ?

2011-06-07T12:05:39  <stocha> it seems all java bot run into the trouble.
2011-06-07T12:08:14  <UncleVasya> stocha: it's because of betaserver's low RAM.  On the main server it will be ok.
2011-06-07T12:08:59  <locutus2> McLeopold: what think you about testing trueskill stability by running a second copy of a bot?
2011-06-07T12:09:13  <locutus2> if it for the server admins ok i would try it
2011-06-07T12:09:43  <stocha> why not try with less players then ?
2011-06-07T12:09:46  <stocha> like 3
2011-06-07T12:09:58  <stocha> so all java bot will not crash all the time.
2011-06-07T12:10:09  <UncleVasya> stocha: If you wanna test your bot against someone's one I can give you an .exe of my bot (top 10 nowbut still very weak).
2011-06-07T12:10:46  <stocha> i don't want to test it against another one :) I know my bot behavior is probably in the best right now.
2011-06-07T12:11:16  <stocha> also the bot is so old, i don't remember anything about the code :p. I just wanted to see how things go.
2011-06-07T12:11:57  <stocha> if it would have enough time and such. apparently it simply doesn't boot most of the time.
2011-06-07T12:12:17  <UncleVasya> Heheh. So I have to be gateful to these problems with Java because only with their help I'm in top 10 now :)
2011-06-07T12:12:51  <stocha> so fare it has 3 crash, and one first position.

2011-06-07T12:45:49  <janzert> wow, McLeopold posted a question on stack overflow 2 hours ago and it is already the top result in google for the related query "php detect max_post_size exceeded"
2011-06-07T12:46:40  <locutus2> after upload the last url is http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/check_submit.php and a blank site
2011-06-07T12:47:28  <janzert> locutus2: it shouldn't be doing any duplicate detection
2011-06-07T12:47:53  <janzert> locutus2: can you try uploading say a starter bot package and see if that works?
2011-06-07T12:48:07  <janzert> locutus2: it sounds like check_submit.php got broken though
2011-06-07T12:51:07  <locutus2> i try a starter bot kit
2011-06-07T12:52:29  <locutus2> no, the same problem, no new submission and a black site
2011-06-07T12:54:38  <locutus2> i try to resubmit my bot on my normal account
2011-06-07T12:55:53  <janzert> ok, my guess is McLeopold is doing some work on trying to fix a bug in that file
2011-06-07T12:56:28  <janzert> at least hopefully he's still actively working and didn't accidentally leave it in a completely broken state
2011-06-07T12:57:17  <locutus2> i have resubmit my own bot, there i get the error my file is too big. A Maximum of 1 KB is allowed!

2011-06-07T13:08:46  <janzert> since we only have to handle a single upload at a time, I wonder if the simplest/best fix isn't to just make sure max_post_size is larger than upload_max_filesize?
2011-06-07T13:09:46  <janzert> i.e. set the former to 11MB and the latter to 10MB
2011-06-07T13:20:10  <McLeopold> janzert: that's a fun idea
2011-06-07T13:21:12  <McLeopold> janzert: they can always exceed post_size, and then the super globals are blank
2011-06-07T13:28:14  <janzert> also set a MAX_FILE_SIZE hidden input in the upload form that precedes the file input and apparently php will cut the upload off at that size
2011-06-07T13:29:22  <janzert> doesn't stop a malicious user from going larger but will stop any normal user from seeing the nasty error case
2011-06-07T13:29:31  <janzert> http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.post-method.php
2011-06-07T13:32:15  <janzert> although the above page implies the browser will prevent the upload altogether if it exceeds MAX_FILE_SIZE but from reading elsewhere it is rather confusing whether browsers actually do or not

2011-06-07T14:07:00  <Frontier> If I close the pipe the engine would have to handle the closed stdout.

2011-06-07T14:10:03  <Frontier> On another note, the visualizer is so slow that I had to make it signal to the stdin reader when it is ready for another turn. Before the screen would never update as the new turns came in faster than the JavaScript processing them would execute :p
2011-06-07T14:11:10  <McLeopold> Frontier: I haven't actually used the java visualizer with streaming
2011-06-07T14:12:48  <McLeopold> I would probably close the pipe and make playgame handle it.  Playgame might also be doing other logging, so we wouldn't want to kill the game.
2011-06-07T14:12:49  <Frontier> eh.. how could you. the streaming format isn't implemented yet
2011-06-07T14:13:22  <McLeopold> so, yeah, I couldn't :)
2011-06-07T14:14:11  <Frontier> Close the pipe, ok. I think that's best. Just right now the Python script will error out at this point.

2011-06-07T17:00:12  <amstan> when the process quits?
2011-06-07T17:03:58  <UncleVasya> The moment when I already can read the replay file.
2011-06-07T17:05:26  <UncleVasya> process is python.exe and I'm not sure I can easy determine that it is a process I really need.
2011-06-07T17:06:52  <UncleVasya> For example, I determine that I already can read game result data from 0.replay file (game_logs\) by checking replay.html existense.
2011-06-07T17:07:15  <amstan> well.. you're launching the python process from inside your app
2011-06-07T17:07:22  <amstan> you should be able to monitor the same process
2011-06-07T17:07:28  <UncleVasya> If replay.html exists than game ended and I can deal 0.replay
2011-06-07T17:08:24  <UncleVasya> Do not laugh. I am creating a cmd-file like play_one_game.cmd but with user's settings :)
2011-06-07T17:08:44  <UncleVasya> And then launch it.
2011-06-07T17:08:55  <amstan> so check when the cmd file quits
2011-06-07T17:09:04  <amstan> also.. i really can't not laugh
2011-06-07T17:09:29  <UncleVasya> I'll try to check.
2011-06-07T17:10:19  <UncleVasya> I've tried to launch playgame.py directly but I found the way with cmd-file easier.
2011-06-07T17:10:47  <UncleVasya> Need to rejoin.
2011-06-07T17:14:53  <antimatroid> bah, 7 15am

2011-06-07T17:48:55  <janzert> UncleVasya: do you even actually need replay.html or are you still just trying find a way to know when playgame finishes?
2011-06-07T17:48:57  <antimatroid> anyway, shower time
2011-06-07T17:50:02  <janzert> I do have a slightly hard time thinking that there is a language that allows you to launch other processes without being able to check if they've exited later
2011-06-07T17:50:32  <mcstar> UncleVasya: there are blocking function calls, return values, temporary files, process viewver whatever
2011-06-07T17:50:42  <UncleVasya> janzert: I will copy every replay.html and after multimap testing user can click "Watch replay" on every game. But yes, I'm still hope to use it as a detector.
2011-06-07T17:50:48  <mcstar> there are many solutions to your problem
2011-06-07T17:51:09  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: the visualizer can load a replay file, which is a better solution
2011-06-07T17:51:58  <UncleVasya> McLeopold: ok
2011-06-07T17:53:28  <UncleVasya> mcstar: As I am a bad programmer (maybe even not a programmer at all) I have pain with dealing with all this staff.

2011-06-07T17:56:31  <mcstar> maybe this sounds hard for you, but take a look at bash

2011-06-07T17:57:19  <mcstar> i think all that you want can be done in a couple of lines in it, and later you could use it for other purposes as well

2011-06-07T17:57:46  <mcstar> i dont know cmd scripting so i wont recommend that
2011-06-07T17:58:42  <UncleVasya> I have another crazy idea:
2011-06-07T17:59:39  <UncleVasya> 1. Create a backup of visualize_locally.py
2011-06-07T18:00:20  <UncleVasya> Delete these lines:     if not nolaunch:     webbrowser.open('file://'+os.path.realpath(generated_path))
2011-06-07T18:00:54  <mcstar> just set nolauch to true
2011-06-07T18:01:12  <UncleVasya> After testing is over replace visualize_locally.py from backup.
2011-06-07T18:02:19  <UncleVasya> With --nolaunch script will not create an html file. With my solution it will create it but will not open it in the browser.
2011-06-07T18:03:00  <mcstar> write pass after : and put a # after that
2011-06-07T18:04:21  <UncleVasya> Just to edit TextFilele much easier to me than deal with these scary words like blocking function calls, return values, temporary files, process viewver, etc :)
2011-06-07T18:04:38  <mcstar> be aware that in python blocks of codes are separated with indentation
2011-06-07T18:04:57  <mcstar> you can easily mess up a program if you cant see the code structure
2011-06-07T18:05:13  <mcstar> thats why instead of deleting code use pass and partial commenting
2011-06-07T18:05:23  <UncleVasya> valuable advice
2011-06-07T18:07:24  <mcstar> what i would do is: create an array that holds parameters to the script i want to run, id call that script with it in a loop of some kind, then if theres an output file ill be later needing, id rename it, and basically thats all
2011-06-07T18:08:29  <mcstar> if you will be dealing with computers after the contest, too, then its the perfect time to learn basic scripting
2011-06-07T18:09:37  <mcstar> if you can understand us, i dont think ull have any trouble understanding tutorials, and i think theres literature in russian, too

2011-06-07T18:25:35  <McLeopold> george1914: I'm going to implement the seed numbers so we can recreate the games if needed
2011-06-07T18:26:19  <george1914> sounds good - i guess if i knew the seed, i could recreate it myself also?
2011-06-07T18:26:35  <McLeopold> if you had the other bots, and if they are deterministic
2011-06-07T18:27:01  <McLeopold> we should be able to at least see if your bot has the same opening moves until influenced by the other bots
2011-06-07T18:27:25  <george1914> well, it looks totally wrong from move 1 or 2, so other bots dont come into it
2011-06-07T18:27:48  <McLeopold> george1914: for a quicker test, output something unique on stderr at the start of the game and upload that
2011-06-07T18:28:08  <McLeopold> I can check the database if the special string exists

2011-06-07T18:49:56  * janzert goes to look at the question from earlier
2011-06-07T18:50:19  <McLeopold> I was comparing the answers on my question to the older questions.
2011-06-07T18:50:45  <McLeopold> The first answer I got was within 5 minutes, was dead wrong, and had 5 votes.
2011-06-07T18:51:02  <McLeopold> After about 30 mintues, the question is a tumbleweed.
2011-06-07T18:51:09  <mcstar> McLeopold: would it be too expensive to use the ec2 for the beta purposes?
2011-06-07T18:51:23  <McLeopold> mcstar: not if you paid for it :)
2011-06-07T18:51:23  <george1914> McLeopold:  ok, i'll look at overnight games tomorrow morning (8-9 hrs from now), and shout when/if i spot one.   thanks.
2011-06-07T18:51:54  <mcstar> sry, i dont have money right now, otherwise id donate
2011-06-07T18:52:08  <McLeopold> mcstar: I realize the java guys are frustrated, but it's not really an issue we need to solve for beta
2011-06-07T18:52:20  <McLeopold> there's lots of other work to do
2011-06-07T18:52:39  <McLeopold> Right not the goal is not for participants to get games
2011-06-07T18:52:56  <mcstar> yep
2011-06-07T18:55:19  <janzert> McLeopold: one good sign is that locutus2 submitted a copy of his bot and they've been hovering within a rank or two of each other after about 10-15 games
2011-06-07T18:55:35  <McLeopold> that is good
2011-06-07T18:55:43  <McLeopold> probably more accurate than a starter bot test
2011-06-07T18:55:45  <janzert> I actually find it almost worrisomely good
2011-06-07T18:56:03  <janzert> ;)
2011-06-07T18:56:14  <McLeopold> too good?
2011-06-07T18:56:20  <UncleVasya> McLeopold:  I added --nolaunch --html  "game_logs\replay.html"  but it still trying to open it in browser.
2011-06-07T18:56:53  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: --html will assume the --log_dir directory, so make that "--html replay.html"
