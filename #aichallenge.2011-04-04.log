2011-04-04T00:11:52  <antimatroid> amstan: got any strategy ideas for me? :P
2011-04-04T00:11:57  <antimatroid> McLeopold: or you
2011-04-04T00:12:06  <McLeopold> yes
2011-04-04T00:12:15  <antimatroid> see https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Tutorial and the linked strategy guide page
2011-04-04T00:12:50  <McLeopold> maybe suggest A*
2011-04-04T00:13:28  <antimatroid> i did :P
2011-04-04T00:13:50  <antimatroid> but it is only really helpful when you have a given objective square, which you don't
2011-04-04T00:13:52  <McLeopold> maybe suggest it by name
2011-04-04T00:14:00  <antimatroid> I did, i even linked it
2011-04-04T00:14:06  <antimatroid> it's on the strategy guide page under path finding
2011-04-04T00:14:14  <McLeopold> oh
2011-04-04T00:14:22  <McLeopold> suggest 1 ant per food

2011-04-04T00:14:38  <antimatroid> yep, I sort of did but not explicitly
2011-04-04T00:14:43  <antimatroid> i'll do that on the tutorial page

2011-04-04T00:15:42  <antimatroid> i will also point out that you may want to send more if your closest is likely to die with an enemy before reaching the food square
2011-04-04T00:16:01  <McLeopold> or send less if there are 2 food
2011-04-04T00:16:12  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-04T00:16:28  <antimatroid> food collecting is quite untrivial
2011-04-04T00:16:34  <McLeopold> is there an algo for a breeding traveling salesman?
2011-04-04T00:16:45  <antimatroid> haha, not sure
2011-04-04T00:17:03  <antimatroid> i can't really do the battle thing until we pick a resolution method

2011-04-04T00:17:20  <McLeopold> let's not make any suggestions there anyway
2011-04-04T00:17:32  <antimatroid> i want to cover the idea of using game trees for battling
2011-04-04T00:17:41  <McLeopold> I talked with him the day damage was suggestted
2011-04-04T00:17:50  <antimatroid> and mention the difficulties people face with backward induction for general n player games
2011-04-04T00:17:52  <McLeopold> don't get your hopes up
2011-04-04T00:18:39  <antimatroid> ... it needs to be finalised some time anyway..?
2011-04-04T00:19:00  <antimatroid> we need to make some decisions and just go with them, there's too many options all over the place
2011-04-04T00:19:50  <McLeopold> so, if you are in range, all ants die
2011-04-04T00:20:11  <antimatroid> that's worse than iterative closest

2011-04-04T04:47:02  <Stocha> i am in no position to test for score system at the moment. I think there are two reasons for that.
2011-04-04T04:47:18  <Stocha> First i guess you need to have some sort of fighting credibility in order to compare your scoring systems.
2011-04-04T04:47:58  <Stocha> Which is hard when you have no idea of what fighting there will be in. I still bet for Damage X=1. Because i think it is the most consensual at the moment.
2011-04-04T04:49:00  <Stocha> Second, that's a bit silly but well. I simply made nothing worthy, and i'm obsessed at doing something cool with ant bot programming. As i'm totally stuck at the moment( without much time to put in to be fair), i'm too frustrated to put my mind over testing scores systems :p
2011-04-04T04:49:03  <Stocha> However ....
2011-04-04T04:49:14  <Stocha> I still think you have to do it as straight as forward as possible.
2011-04-04T04:49:32  <Stocha> So you would prefer stateless. (inverse order of elimination is)
2011-04-04T04:49:39  <Stocha> (ant counting is also)
2011-04-04T04:50:01  <Stocha> So you could go for (inverse order of elimination /Tie if die in same turn   + ant counting for remaining players
2011-04-04T04:50:23  <Stocha> As you told, the fog of war make it very dangerous to stay still and hide. Because you have no idea what's going on out there.
2011-04-04T04:51:02  <Stocha> I can't believe hiding in a small territory will do it. (although i did'nt do too much multiplayer study)
2011-04-04T04:51:18  <Stocha> Even if it does, it's hard to foretell what scoring system will prevent that.
2011-04-04T04:51:37  <Stocha> So i think the scoring should be stateless, and easy to undertand.
2011-04-04T04:52:23  <Frontier1> Dear diary, today a guy named json knocked on my door and said we have some issues to resolve. He would have scared the hell out of me if it was Friday 13. But this time it is save to say that I just have to load up my IDE.

2011-04-04T10:26:39  <antimatroid> stocha; the best method i could think of would be to find articulation points
2011-04-04T10:26:41  <antimatroid> but they wouldn't actually be articulation points, ignore that
2011-04-04T10:26:41  <stocha> how do one do that ?
2011-04-04T10:26:41  <stocha> ah so let's not do it :p
2011-04-04T10:26:41  <stocha> any other ideas ? :p
2011-04-04T10:26:41  <antimatroid> it's messy, i would try searching the grid with nxn blocks
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> and finding where that can't traverse
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <stocha> yeah that's the only idea i got.
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <stocha> but it seems so much cpu time
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> be careful with that though
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <stocha> well ?
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <stocha> be careful about it in what way ?
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> consider this:
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> ..%
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> ..%
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> %..
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> %..
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <stocha> that's one max block.
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <stocha> on the north to south path
2011-04-04T10:26:42  <antimatroid> if you painted that from all sides, you would mark every square as visited, but you can't actually walk a 2x2 block through there
2011-04-04T10:26:43  <stocha> yeah. So i build a block of 2x2 ants and try to walk everywhere
2011-04-04T10:26:43  <antimatroid> i retract my comment about food gathering being anywhere near trivial :P
2011-04-04T10:26:43  <stocha> if it doesn't work, then this is a choke point. then i spawn randomly ...
2011-04-04T10:26:43  <antimatroid> stocha: but you need to work out where it can't get though, not just the "squares it didn't touch"
2011-04-04T10:26:43  <stocha> and do it for every block size.
2011-04-04T10:26:43  <stocha> Then i come back 10 years later, and i have got all botlneck on the known map.

2011-04-04T10:26:45  <antimatroid> you don't want bottlenecks really unless the opening is quite small
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <stocha> i think i can manager it this way. it's not very satisfying somehow. Though.
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <antimatroid> you should be able to do that reasonably fast
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <stocha> Yeah, but the thing is : i want the bottlenecks, even the large one.
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <stocha> i could even explain why :p
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <antimatroid> ...
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <stocha> walking randomly 2x2 block doesn't sound that fast to me.
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <stocha> i could even try to just spawn every possible 2x2 block that touch known ground.
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <stocha> it would be the same i guess.
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <antimatroid> write a block class, and when you move it, update 2 blocks locations and calculate 2 new ones
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <stocha> where i can't i got a choke point.
2011-04-04T10:26:45  <antimatroid> or just move the top left piece
2011-04-04T10:26:46  <antimatroid> and make sure it's still validly positioned
2011-04-04T10:26:46  <stocha> so basically you try every 2x2 block possible.
2011-04-04T10:26:46  <stocha> and see if it fits or not.
2011-04-04T10:26:46  <antimatroid> there's only one 2x2 block :P
2011-04-04T10:26:46  <antimatroid> net split
2011-04-04T10:26:46  <antimatroid> that was small

2011-04-04T10:27:35  <stocha> so i guess botlneck finding is untrivial also. like the splitting salesman :p
2011-04-04T10:27:47  <stocha> Especially the spliting salesman in presence of ennemies :p
2011-04-04T10:28:08  <stocha> maybe a litle bit less trivial though.
2011-04-04T10:28:14  <stocha> but still probably expensive.
2011-04-04T10:28:28  <antimatroid> i can only really think of a tree for breeding salesman (I like that term more :P)
2011-04-04T10:28:36  <antimatroid> but i want to use a tree for  battles
2011-04-04T10:35:54  <stocha> food is just too important.
2011-04-04T10:35:54  <stocha> we will have to solve it somehow. At least efficiently. if not perfectly (wich is probably quite hard, when you take unexplored potential food into account :p )

2011-04-04T10:43:45  <Frontier1> Is there any way git can simply ignore line endings? i constantly get "modified" files from people who checked their code in with CR/LF instead of just LF.
2011-04-04T10:45:14  <Frontier1> Ideally everyone on Windows would activate git's auto-crlf feature, which converts between Windows and Unix style during checkout/commit.

2011-04-04T10:50:41  <Frontier1> Well, I haven't heard anyone else complaining, so I wonder if I do something wrong.
2011-04-04T10:51:53  <Frontier1> On the other hand github advertises unix line-endings for all files, so I think it is save to ask you to activate that auto-conversion feature :)
2011-04-04T10:53:37  <antimatroid> oh ffs
2011-04-04T10:53:38  <antimatroid> i left a line commented that does the vision for the starter bot

2011-04-04T10:54:22  <Frontier1> don't you get these warnings about CR/LF?
2011-04-04T10:58:08  <Frontier1> if you copied your files from windows and had windows-line-endings in it, I could imagine that your ide did not auto-convert the existing lines.
2011-04-04T10:58:15  <antimatroid> nope
2011-04-04T11:00:41  <antimatroid> yeah that wouldn't surprise me

2011-04-04T11:07:37  <Frontier1> code::blocks is great, it just loads the plugins a lot faster on windows for me. on linux/gtk creating wxWidgets guis from xml descriptions seems to be very slow. what is your experience?

2011-04-04T11:10:04  <Frontier1> so you have the start-fast-switch enabled. hmm. i start to hate gentoo. should have used ubuntu in the first place
2011-04-04T11:10:40  <antimatroid> where is the "start fast switch"?
2011-04-04T11:10:59  <antimatroid> i can't believe i didn't switch to ubuntu ages ago
2011-04-04T11:11:38  <Frontier1> if i knew where the start fast switch was, I would use it on my computer to have the same fast code::blocks as on windows :(
2011-04-04T11:13:40  <Frontier1> my father uses kubuntu. kde has some amazing tools, like digikam. on a gnome desktop the tools are mostly minimalistic, but digikam offers photo enhancement tools, you would find in a commercial app. k3b is also a nice dvd-burning application
2011-04-04T11:14:49  <Frontier1> the music player amarok (version 1) is also one of the best.

2011-04-04T11:50:52  <Frontier> Well there was some OpenGL stuff, but that doesn't count. It was just a basic Window without any buttons and labels, so I used the xorg windowing functions directly.

2011-04-04T12:27:25  <antimatroid> when you move an ant towards a food square, you could also "place an ant" at that food square, indicating when it will be there, then when you scan from another food square, if you hit that, you add how many turns you can use the ant in and consider that ant again

2011-04-04T14:18:04  <phire> antimatroid, thats a great idea
2011-04-04T14:18:24  <Keth> Anyone would like to collaborate and share their bot so we could run tests, let them fight and improve them? I know there is HunterBot but my AI has 99.99% win ratio against it so there isn't much to improve. And fighting with myself seems kind of pointless. Anyone interested just message me.
2011-04-04T14:18:46  <antimatroid> Keth: i don't know anyone else with a bot sorry
2011-04-04T14:18:53  <antimatroid> i guess there's probably quite a few of you now :\
2011-04-04T14:19:07  <Keth> Yeah I understand.
2011-04-04T14:19:13  <Keth> But still, I'm sure there is somebody who did something.
2011-04-04T14:19:16  <antimatroid> Keth: want are you doing? have you seen the strategy idea pages i started making?
2011-04-04T14:19:22  <antimatroid> i'm welcome to ideas to add to it
2011-04-04T14:19:35  <Keth> I'm not really looking for a final version from anyone
2011-04-04T14:19:58  <antimatroid> yeah, i have only written the c++ starter package
2011-04-04T14:20:03  <antimatroid> i've been busy doing other stuff
2011-04-04T14:20:40  <phire> but not exactly accurate, In the future you are going to have 2 ants there, not 1
2011-04-04T14:20:41  <Keth> Oh nice, I'm actually using that c++ starter package
2011-04-04T14:20:49  <Keth> and I know I should contribute but I'm not sure if I would like to share my AI strategy
2011-04-04T14:21:05  <antimatroid> phire: true, place 2 new ones, with the information
2011-04-04T14:21:30  <antimatroid> Keth: ahh, i just updated it recently to include vision calculation for you and changed the structure a bit :P
2011-04-04T14:21:53  <antimatroid> is there anything you particularly hate or feel is missing from it?
2011-04-04T14:22:13  <antimatroid> you're the first person i've come across using it
2011-04-04T14:23:29  <antimatroid> although line 22 of bot.cc should not be commented for what's uploaded
2011-04-04T14:23:33  <antimatroid> i need to fix that :\
2011-04-04T14:23:58  <Frontier> jesus christ, stop workin on your bots. we will never catch up in two months.
2011-04-04T14:24:51  <antimatroid> Frontier: it makes it less bad that we're competing now
2011-04-04T14:24:58  <Frontier> Then again, after all the time I put into the visualizer it might well be that I can't see any more ants when the contest starts.
2011-04-04T14:25:31  <antimatroid> if i do gsoc i'll probably have to give myself an early end date anyway
2011-04-04T14:26:01  <Keth> antimatroid: I rewrote quite a bit, wrote my own classes Map, Ant, Debug and so on.
2011-04-04T14:26:01  <Keth> antimatroid: I'm quite fine :3

2011-04-04T14:27:48  <antimatroid> Keth: what was wrong with the bug struct i gave you?
2011-04-04T14:27:50  <Frontier> antimatroid: were any new algorithms added to the starter bots, like pathfinding?
2011-04-04T14:28:16  <antimatroid> i expect you to restructure a lot of other stuff, it's mostly aimed at people who don't want to restructure, mine will be different, but the bug struct is awesome
2011-04-04T14:29:00  <antimatroid> Frontier: i added vision to run behind the scenes, and i'm updating ant locations so that it's easier to "avoid collisions", but i'm still doing to naive strategy and only not walking onto water
2011-04-04T14:29:37  <antimatroid> Frontier: once it reads the state each turn, it will update the squares "lastSeen" variable to the current turn, and i added Square and Location structs
2011-04-04T14:29:39  <Keth> antimatroid: What's wrong with yours is that you're not able to recognize invidual ant and have it's own pointer data. The ant ID's change every turn so you need to have your own Ant class to keep track of the correct IDs.
2011-04-04T14:30:05  <antimatroid> Keth: yeah that's fine, but you said you wrote your own Debug class? what was wrong with the Bug one?
2011-04-04T14:30:31  <antimatroid> i don't care to differentiate which ant is which of mine
2011-04-04T14:30:38  <Keth> yea I understand
2011-04-04T14:30:51  <antimatroid> ... so why did you write a Debug class? :P
2011-04-04T14:31:36  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp/Bug.h
2011-04-04T14:31:41  <antimatroid> i really like that
2011-04-04T14:32:31  <Frontier> antimatroid: If I find the time I may look at your code and update my starter.
2011-04-04T14:32:56  <Keth> for the debug, I just added more stuff for my own purposes, outputing json, logError(), logWarning() so then when I run 1000 tests I can see if there are any warnings, it sums up at the end of the game.
2011-04-04T14:33:26  <antimatroid> ah okay, i thought you redid the whole passing debug to a file again
2011-04-04T14:33:33  <Keth> No no, passing is not changed
2011-04-04T14:33:37  <Keth> and silly functions to help me out debugging the AI: drawLine(), drawText()
2011-04-04T14:33:44  <Keth> they go straight to vizualizer
2011-04-04T14:33:45  <antimatroid> have you got a game tree yet?
2011-04-04T14:34:07  <Keth> game tree?
2011-04-04T14:35:04  <antimatroid> i'm planning to use a game tree for ants that are within a certain range of enemies for battles
2011-04-04T14:35:41  <Keth> I think the highest priority and what is most important is being able to keep track of invidual ants
2011-04-04T14:35:44  <Keth> I don't know how can you write AI without that
2011-04-04T14:35:47  <antimatroid> basically "avoid battles if you will not get at least a 1:1 death/kill ratio"
2011-04-04T14:35:59  <antimatroid> i don't see the need for tracking individual ants
2011-04-04T14:36:05  <Keth> You really don't?
2011-04-04T14:36:42  <Keth> Tell me how would you set an ant state to "wait" - just an example
2011-04-04T14:37:34  <antimatroid> my basic strategy intention is something like follows "assign each food square an ant and move the ant towards it, use a game tree for deciding moves of any ants near enemies and use heuristics to spread the rest out and move them towards battles"
2011-04-04T14:37:57  <Keth> your AI is pretty much grid based, not structural based - that's why you don't see a purpose of it.
2011-04-04T14:37:57  <antimatroid> or unexplored land, not recently seen land etc.
2011-04-04T14:38:57  <antimatroid> :P possibly
2011-04-04T14:39:11  <Keth> I keep my invidual ants in seperate class, I have much more freedom with it. Ant* ant = getAntFrom(Location(5,5)); ant->setState(STATE_WAIT);
2011-04-04T14:39:24  *** dwchandl1r <dwchandl1r!~dwc@tuppy.intrepidhosting.net> has left #aichallenge
2011-04-04T14:39:27  <Keth> just an example of what you can't really
2011-04-04T14:39:45  <antimatroid> i could have a list of locations that are to wait :P
2011-04-04T14:39:55  <Keth> And you would keep 10 arrays for 10 variables?
2011-04-04T14:40:03  <antimatroid> i'm considering using sets rather than grids for my actual bot
2011-04-04T14:40:24  <Keth> yeah but 10 variables like STATE, isAggressive, hasFoundFood
2011-04-04T14:40:31  <Keth> you would need like 10 arrays
2011-04-04T14:40:41  <Keth> which is really a bad structure
2011-04-04T14:40:51  <Keth> It really depends on your AI
2011-04-04T14:40:54  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't keep information like that across states
2011-04-04T14:41:01  <Keth> yeah, if you don't then it's fine
2011-04-04T14:41:07  <Keth> but it defaintely gives you more freedom
2011-04-04T14:41:20  <antimatroid> i had previously considered having an ant class, but i don't need that much information
2011-04-04T14:41:43  <Keth> like I said, depends on strategy
2011-04-04T14:41:47  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-04T14:42:05  <antimatroid> had you looked at vision yet?
2011-04-04T14:42:22  <antimatroid> the updated bot has code for that, be careful trying to make that faster (i've made that clear with the comments)
2011-04-04T14:42:50  <Keth> yeah, I'm not using vision at all for my strategy. I only calculate area_covered in percent and visibility_covered
2011-04-04T14:43:18  <antimatroid> i use visibility information when searching the map
2011-04-04T14:43:36  <antimatroid> if i have to send an ant somewhere, send it towards an unseen/not recently seen square
2011-04-04T14:43:51  <Keth> I changed:
2011-04-04T14:43:57  <Keth> grid = vector<vector<char> >(rows, vector<char>(cols, '.')); to grid = vector<vector<char> >(rows, vector<char>(cols, '?'));
2011-04-04T14:44:10  <Keth> and then keep track of which are visible
2011-04-04T14:44:20  <antimatroid> yeah, i changed that to a 2d vector of Squares now
2011-04-04T14:44:24  <Keth> so then you just do grid[1][1] = "?" or isSquareVisible()
2011-04-04T14:44:29  <Keth> but you don't need seperate grid
2011-04-04T14:44:39  <Keth> which I guess you keep two seperate arrays
2011-04-04T14:45:50  <antimatroid> and each square has a lastSeen variables, starting at 0 (when you output the grid, it will output ? if lastSeen is 0, ~ if lastSeen < turn), then after reading input, it'll do a breadth first search from each ant marking each visible square as lastSeen to the current turn
2011-04-04T14:46:38  <Keth> It's not bad that way but I'm kind of used to writing fast code and efficient memory use
2011-04-04T14:46:51  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2011-04-04T14:47:16  <antimatroid> i'm trying to make it as usable for beginners as possible, i myself don't plan to use exactly what i provide
2011-04-04T14:47:33  <phire> As far as I can tell, fast code might actually be important in this challange
2011-04-04T14:47:45  <antimatroid> phire: yep
2011-04-04T14:47:48  <Keth> It just feels like your structure is kinda limited, you can't save variables for ants, you use many arrays. It might work for now but it might impact later on
2011-04-04T14:48:30  <antimatroid> i agree, it's hard to know exactly how to make the starter bot though
2011-04-04T14:48:45  <Keth> i might be just too familiar with physics engines and the way they are structured
2011-04-04T14:48:51  <Keth> since I even added velocity for my ant
2011-04-04T14:48:52  <Keth> lol
2011-04-04T14:48:53  <antimatroid> beginners are least likely to be able to make any real changes for themselves, so they are my highest priority
2011-04-04T14:49:14  <antimatroid> lol, i can't see how the velocity matters? surely it's always the same?
2011-04-04T14:49:19  <Keth> naw
2011-04-04T14:49:20  <antimatroid> well, for a moving ant
2011-04-04T14:49:23  <Keth> my ants have physical position
2011-04-04T14:49:28  <Keth> and velocity
2011-04-04T14:49:36  <Keth> and they steer to that position
2011-04-04T14:49:54  <antimatroid> interesting

2011-04-04T14:52:13  <antimatroid> what's your experience with the asymmetric ones?
2011-04-04T14:52:18  <antimatroid> are the fair at all?
2011-04-04T14:52:27  <Keth> phire: I see, I have been through it =D
2011-04-04T14:52:34  <Keth> antimatroid: I would recommend to keep them 1v1
2011-04-04T14:52:43  <Keth> antimatroid: I really can't imagine ants will be more than 2 players for the final matchups
2011-04-04T14:52:53  <Keth> antimatroid: I modify your map to do 1v1 testing
2011-04-04T14:52:55  <antimatroid> 1v1 is a different game
2011-04-04T14:53:18  <Keth> antimatroid: 1v1v1v1 is much more about luck
2011-04-04T14:53:28  <antimatroid> not in the long run
2011-04-04T14:53:49  <Keth> antimatroid: in a long run less but trust me, still lots of luck.
2011-04-04T14:54:07  <Keth> antimatroid: I hope you're reading the forums
2011-04-04T14:54:14  <antimatroid> i am
2011-04-04T14:55:29  <antimatroid> the problem is n player is a different game and lots of people expressed wanting to do that
2011-04-04T14:55:33  <Naktibalda> basic question, if spawnradius is 1, does it access vertical and horizontal neighbours only or diagonals too?
2011-04-04T14:55:46  <antimatroid> i was originally opposed, but this game has lots of cool cooperation aspects, so i would be quite disappointed to move back to 1v1 noq
2011-04-04T14:55:48  <antimatroid> now*
2011-04-04T14:55:57  <Keth> you should know about how 1v1v1v1 is being imbalanced compared to 1v1, even in a long run
2011-04-04T14:56:01  <antimatroid> Naktibalda: diagonal is sqrt(2) away
2011-04-04T14:56:10  <Keth> you have lots of info about that on forums, I give 95% percent you will never see 1v1v1v1
2011-04-04T14:56:54  * Naktibalda should think about map like a go board, not a chess board
2011-04-04T14:57:05  <Keth> Haha
2011-04-04T14:57:25  <Naktibalda> textual presentation doesn't help to do that
2011-04-04T14:58:16  <Keth> exactly, but you're asking for textual answer
2011-04-04T14:58:41  <antimatroid> Keth: what about 1v1v1?
2011-04-04T14:58:48  <Keth> antimatroid: It's not about the balance only
2011-04-04T14:58:52  <antimatroid> we can do full symmetry including relative starting positions then
2011-04-04T14:58:52  <Keth> antimatroid: It's a lot about TrueSkill
2011-04-04T14:59:36  <Keth> antimatroid: relative starting positions has been already tried but it did not work out.
2011-04-04T15:00:24  <Keth> antimatroid: trust me, it's not going to change to relative positions
2011-04-04T15:00:38  <antimatroid> ?
2011-04-04T15:00:51  <Keth> Which part?
2011-04-04T15:01:01  <antimatroid> change to relative positions
2011-04-04T15:01:06  <Keth> Well, it's not going to happen.
2011-04-04T15:01:10  <Keth> I can guarantee you that
2011-04-04T15:01:11  <antimatroid> oh, i wasn't referring to that
2011-04-04T15:01:30  <antimatroid> i meant if you have more than 4 players, you can't have every player with "equal" access to every other player on the map
2011-04-04T15:01:38  <antimatroid> but you can with 3
2011-04-04T15:01:54  <antimatroid> more than or equal to 4
2011-04-04T15:02:00  <Keth> More than 2 players, won't work.
2011-04-04T15:02:09  <antimatroid> you can do it with 3 and wrapped edges
2011-04-04T15:02:31  <Keth> Lots of issues with TrueSkill, coding it, beginners having difficulty understanding, very easy to figure out the map after few steps anyway
2011-04-04T15:02:45  <Keth> I guarantee you it will be 2 players
2011-04-04T15:02:52  <antimatroid> a beginner wouldn't understand bayeslo any more than they would trueskill
2011-04-04T15:02:58  <Keth> (just my opinion)
2011-04-04T15:03:23  <Keth> we'll see, there isn't much to debate

2011-04-04T16:17:29  <antimatroid> Frontier: is zooming still too hard? :P
2011-04-04T16:18:00  <Frontier> why do you always want to zoom? is your screen too small? :p
2011-04-04T16:18:31  <antimatroid> my screen is large
2011-04-04T16:18:44  <antimatroid> i'm worried about having to restrict the max dimensions so that people can reasonably watch it
2011-04-04T16:19:03  <antimatroid> if people could zoom, we can sort of ignore that more
2011-04-04T16:19:08  <Frontier> well, that is a different story
2011-04-04T16:19:16  *** chris__0076 <chris__0076!~Chris_007@adsl-190-125-144.asm.bellsouth.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2011-04-04T16:19:17  <amstan> Frontier: nah.. it's ok
2011-04-04T16:19:17  <amstan> i think you can do browser zoom
2011-04-04T16:19:17  <amstan> Frontier: actually.. i'm getting weird behavoir with zooming
2011-04-04T16:19:19  <amstan> Frontier: everything gets smaller
2011-04-04T16:19:26  <amstan> instead of bigger
2011-04-04T16:19:36  <antimatroid> well even 200x200 would be too hard to really watch now yeah?
2011-04-04T16:19:56  <antimatroid> then again, i do feel that's too large to play a reasonable game on that doesn't take too long
2011-04-04T16:20:11  <Frontier> I don't know if it is good to have a game that doesn't fit on screen.
2011-04-04T16:20:46  <antimatroid> provided you could sort of make out what's going on globally with it placed on 1 screen, i don't think it'd matter too much
2011-04-04T16:21:07  <antimatroid> you could still zoom in and look at specific stuff more closely
2011-04-04T16:21:56  <antimatroid> hehe i can make it smalled with ctrl scroll
2011-04-04T16:22:39  <antimatroid> amstan: yeah i get that :\
2011-04-04T16:22:43  <antimatroid> it's a bit weird hey
2011-04-04T16:22:54  <antimatroid> but not really an issue
2011-04-04T16:22:55  <Frontier> browser zoom works differently among browsers
2011-04-04T16:23:04  <Frontier> opera does what you expect, amstan
2011-04-04T16:23:47  <amstan> Frontier: chrome and firefox don't

2011-04-04T16:25:28  <antimatroid> it would also allow LARGE crazy maps if we had zooming :P
2011-04-04T16:25:56  <antimatroid> like mega 16 player games on 1000x1000 maps :P
2011-04-04T16:26:00  <antimatroid> would be cool to watch the result
2011-04-04T16:26:13  <antimatroid> maybe not quite 1000x1000
2011-04-04T16:26:51  <Frontier> and for the record: Safari behaves like Firefox and Chrome

2011-04-04T16:29:49  <Frontier> i had that in one version
2011-04-04T16:30:10  <antimatroid> i do
2011-04-04T16:31:43  <Frontier> i think i was using a ceil function to calculate the bounding box and used that value for the visibility calculation, but it was wrong. it has to be floor.
2011-04-04T16:33:08  <antimatroid> fixed, i was using ints for viewradius etc :P
2011-04-04T16:33:17  <antimatroid> thanks for that comment :P
2011-04-04T16:33:40  <antimatroid> Keth: change viewradius etc. in state to doubles
2011-04-04T16:34:40  <Frontier> there is nothing wrong with ints, as long as you keep every distance squared
2011-04-04T16:35:28  <Frontier> it may be faster than floating point arithmetic
2011-04-04T16:35:35  <antimatroid> yes, but it's the starter package, i want it to be easy to understand for beginners

2011-04-04T16:36:59  <Frontier> I plan to draw letters on the ants, so keep the map size small antimatroid :p
2011-04-04T16:37:26  <antimatroid> Frontier: i think 120x120 is the best size
2011-04-04T16:38:28  <antimatroid> that's the lcm of like (2,3,4,5,6,8), so that people can't guess how many players might be on the game if we chose them strictly from that set
2011-04-04T16:38:48  <Frontier> ah that is smart
2011-04-04T16:39:47  <Frontier> Do you have a .replay of a game on such a map?

2011-04-04T16:40:09  <antimatroid> actually, i could make you the replay :P

2011-04-04T17:09:57  <Frontier> Is the visualizer up to date then?
2011-04-04T17:12:38  <Frontier> git pull, cd ants/visualizer, ant jar -> gives you a visualizer.jar that you can run with the .replay as the command-line option. But you can use the html version of course with visualize_locally.py.
2011-04-04T17:13:42  <Frontier> there is a new file 'copy_paste.html' now as well where you can paste replay strings. But you said the engine doesn't emit json files, so the problem must be somewhere else.
2011-04-04T17:17:27  <Keth> I updated to newest everything from today
2011-04-04T17:17:31  <Keth> the replay file is still not json

2011-04-04T23:22:05  <antimatroid> amstan: provided mcleopold and sigh agree, i think we really need to get jeff to make some decisions soon
2011-04-04T23:22:13  <amstan> antimatroid: about?
2011-04-04T23:22:23  <antimatroid> it's been over a week since that post was made to reddit, and we've been saying "a few weeks" for a while now
2011-04-04T23:22:29  <antimatroid> battle, scoring etc.
2011-04-04T23:23:00  <amstan> antimatroid: can you setup some page or something so jeff can get up to speed?
2011-04-04T23:23:10  <antimatroid> there is one for battle resolutions
2011-04-04T23:23:11  <amstan> on what he needs to decide
2011-04-04T23:23:14  <antimatroid> i will do one for scoring
2011-04-04T23:23:41  <antimatroid> i will talk to mcleopold and sigh
2011-04-04T23:23:44  <antimatroid> and work something out
2011-04-04T23:23:56  <antimatroid> sigh: ^^
2011-04-04T23:25:42  <amstan> k, i summoned him

2011-04-04T23:33:01  <amstan> antimatroid: you said not yet? when? lol
2011-04-04T23:33:19  <antimatroid> "provided mcleopold and sigh agree", "i will talk to mcleopold and sigh"
2011-04-04T23:34:08  <antimatroid> i don't want to pull jeff in for important decisions like that without their consent
2011-04-04T23:34:13  <amstan> agree to what? jeff summoning? lol
2011-04-04T23:34:24  <amstan> w/e.. jeff has to be summoned either way
2011-04-04T23:34:30  <antimatroid> jeff can come and get up to speed, but yeah
2011-04-04T23:34:42  <antimatroid> i would prefer them to be okay with a decision being made if one is going to be
2011-04-04T23:35:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold especially as he's done more than most (excepting maybe Frontier)

2011-04-04T23:52:19  <antimatroid> oh, do you agree that we should get jeff in to make some (at least initial) decisions about battle/scoring
2011-04-04T23:52:34  <antimatroid> we've been saying "a few weeks" for a while
2011-04-04T23:52:49  <sigh> is there any reason not agree?
2011-04-04T23:53:12  <antimatroid> i don't know, i just don't want to "go around" you and mcleopold
2011-04-04T23:53:30  <antimatroid> particularly when it's on a topic most people seem interested in
2011-04-04T23:53:51  <sigh> can I outsource my decision making to you?
2011-04-04T23:54:16  <antimatroid> you could, but all i was asking was that you have no objections :P
2011-04-04T23:55:20  <sigh> I have no objections

2011-04-04T23:57:03  <antimatroid> amstan: when have you not been?
2011-04-04T23:57:24  <amstan> well.. it seems like stuff has been slowed down lately
2011-04-04T23:57:27  <amstan> i was just checking
2011-04-04T23:57:32  <amstan> maybe i missed something
2011-04-04T23:58:28  <sigh> for my part people tell me stuff needs to be added to the engine and I add it... so I don't know much about the hold ups
