2011-09-07T06:16:55  <mleise> Let's do two player games only.
2011-09-07T06:19:07  <antimatroid> mleise: ?
2011-09-07T06:19:59  <mleise> It's more interesting to watch games with just you and your arch enemy
2011-09-07T06:20:26  <mleise> And these matchup and ranking problems could be avoided
2011-09-07T06:21:20  <antimatroid> hmmm :(
2011-09-07T06:21:26  <mleise> :)
2011-09-07T06:21:27  <antimatroid> i would have liked at least up to 4 or 5 players
2011-09-07T06:21:34  <rabidus>  up to unlimited
2011-09-07T06:21:45  <antimatroid> and i was originally very opposed to moving away from 2 player games :P
2011-09-07T06:21:53  <mleise> why not put all players in one game?
2011-09-07T06:22:01  <rabidus> yeah
2011-09-07T06:22:26  <antimatroid> not enough resources, maps would need to be LARGE which bots couldn't handle, too much noise etc. etc. :P
2011-09-07T06:23:39  <mleise> I whish I could make the games as entertaining to watch as Planet Wars matches!
2011-09-07T06:23:48  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-09-07T06:24:00  <antimatroid> even tron was more fun to watch :\
2011-09-07T06:24:07  <mleise> really? :O
2011-09-07T06:24:07  <antimatroid> well, maybe not
2011-09-07T06:24:17  <antimatroid> i'm comparing the ants bots to the best tron bots
2011-09-07T06:24:21  <antimatroid> a bit of an unfair comparison
2011-09-07T06:24:25  <rabidus> hey! nukes, mines, heat targeting missles, and such!
2011-09-07T06:24:25  <rabidus> :D
2011-09-07T06:25:00  <rabidus> (was a joke)
2011-09-07T06:31:39  <mleise> We had some funny ideas in the forum. But for simplicity sake much didn't make it.
2011-09-07T06:34:07  <mleise> Oh btw... does anyone want to write a map editor? We could use some nice hand-crafted maps
2011-09-07T06:42:47  <berak> sorry to disturb you, mleise , but the latest push seems broken with firefox(3.6.7 / 6.0.2)  http://i.imgur.com/MkG4Y.png
2011-09-07T06:45:20  <mleise> I use 3.6.20 and don't see a problem on the server
2011-09-07T06:45:35  <mleise> berak: How can I reproduce this?
2011-09-07T06:49:19  <berak> good question, seems to happen with the server and locally: http://i.imgur.com/RzWpP.png
2011-09-07T06:51:03  <berak> the mouse leaves a trail, and everything off-center is black
2011-09-07T06:55:08  <mleise> ok, I'll try to revert the rendering mode to default. thought copy mode would make it faster. but if that is the cause of gfx gliches like this... did you try reloading the visualizer (i.e. clear cache?)
2011-09-07T06:55:54  <berak> let me do that
2011-09-07T06:56:11  <mleise> oh wait, now I see artifacts as well in Opera.
2011-09-07T06:56:41  <berak> same
2011-09-07T06:57:55  <berak> it's only today's changes worked 24 hrs before
2011-09-07T07:00:09  <mleise> berak: does this game work for you? http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=158410
2011-09-07T07:01:34  <berak> no, same problems. mouse trails, black sides, fog only on the outside
2011-09-07T07:04:02  <berak> my vintage seamonkey can handle it, but not ff
2011-09-07T07:05:28  <mleise> Yeah I should revert to alpha blending mode. it seems like browsers all handle the non-default blending modes differently. I was hoping that a simple plain overwrite mode would make things faster
2011-09-07T07:08:30  <mleise> Actually it slowed down Opera by solid 50% *g*. Damnit.
2011-09-07T07:08:33  <berak> started ubuntu in a vm, old ff3.5.3 there -works fine. so maybe a windows problem only

2011-09-07T10:22:52  <MikeTheAnt> hi all, there has been no games played today?  for anyone?
2011-09-07T10:22:53  <berak> python taught me otherwise ;(
2011-09-07T10:23:28  <mcstar> i played several today
2011-09-07T10:24:44  <mcstar> in fact i just started another one
2011-09-07T10:25:00  <MikeTheAnt> I had a game early morning and since then it has said: "88 players are ahead of you. The current game rate is about 0.0 players per minute. Your next game could take awhile..."
2011-09-07T10:25:03  <mcstar> my bot spits out ppm images of the influence maps
2011-09-07T10:25:28  <mcstar> i think it is correct
2011-09-07T10:25:36  <antimatroid> mcstar: yes, it's a contest about strategy :)
2011-09-07T10:26:11  <antimatroid> not ones ability to play a game, but how they can come up with a strategy to play it (and then with bugs how well you can implement said strategy)
2011-09-07T10:26:49  <mcstar> my strategy will be very happy in the end
2011-09-07T10:27:53  <mcstar> antimatroid: what do you say to this? couple of the top players should make their executables available, so that others could match their bots locally, so they would stop complaining till the contest starts?
2011-09-07T10:28:25  <antimatroid> nah, just have them wait
2011-09-07T10:28:29  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-07T10:28:36  <antimatroid> if a tcp server went up they'd stop complaining :P
2011-09-07T10:28:56  <mcstar> yeah, i guess, bereak how advanced yours is now?
2011-09-07T10:28:59  <antimatroid> once tcp up the main server is useless until the final contest except for bragging rights imo

2011-09-07T10:33:27  <berak> at least those 'moved blocked' things got fixed, and running multitheraded, a game only takes 1 or three minutes
2011-09-07T10:34:41  <mcstar> i dont think it matters how fast the engine is, isnt it true that if the bots take their time, than that will be much greater than the time the engine needs to calculate the next turn?
2011-09-07T10:35:06  <berak> yep
2011-09-07T10:35:07  <antimatroid> it would still be nice if the engine isn't ridiculously slow

2011-09-07T10:49:58  <mcstar> berak: well yeah, im diffusing the influence of my ants over the map
2011-09-07T10:50:17  <mcstar> i read about these a bit, and it seems they are a basic RTS/AI technique
2011-09-07T10:50:41  <delt0r> yea
2011-09-07T10:50:49  <delt0r> I have tried them in my RTS
2011-09-07T10:51:15  <delt0r> "influence maps" is similar
2011-09-07T10:51:39  <mcstar> im mentioned that earlier didnt I?
2011-09-07T10:51:40  <delt0r> was not so impressed tbh --but then my RTS have very open terrain
2011-09-07T10:51:55  <delt0r> mcstar: sorry missed it
2011-09-07T10:52:32  <mcstar> another kind of map is the potential map /method
2011-09-07T10:52:57  <mcstar> but as far as i understand its for navigating and instead of pathfinding
2011-09-07T10:53:10  <delt0r> But you know you can "solve" the diffusion very efficiently  with supergrid methods
2011-09-07T10:53:20  <mcstar> so im using influence maps(trying to) to make strategic decisions
2011-09-07T10:53:28  <delt0r> The math is more or less the same
2011-09-07T10:53:35  <mcstar> idk
2011-09-07T10:53:41  <mcstar> i mean ive just tried it
2011-09-07T10:53:46  <berak> doing that recursively was gross slow, but then i found some old double-buffering code for that
2011-09-07T10:54:16  <mcstar> double-buffering is a fancy term for not in-place calculation
2011-09-07T10:54:27  <berak> hehe
2011-09-07T10:54:36  <mcstar> and its not recursively but iteratively right?
2011-09-07T10:54:46  *** foRei <foRei!~ViT@0x4dd7b24d.adsl.cybercity.dk> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-07T10:54:49  <berak> that's the point
2011-09-07T10:55:02  <mcstar> ?
2011-09-07T10:55:04  <delt0r> supergrid methods can solve the diffusion equation (potential equation) with log(n) iterations
2011-09-07T10:55:10  <mcstar> did you try it recursively?
2011-09-07T10:55:16  <mcstar> i mean why=how?
2011-09-07T10:55:22  <mcstar> why/how?
2011-09-07T10:55:55  <mcstar> delt0r: a moment, seems interesting but first lets execute berak
2011-09-07T10:55:57  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-07T10:56:03  * berak googles supergrid
2011-09-07T10:56:19  <mcstar> no, berak answers my questions
2011-09-07T10:56:30  <berak> hell, don't shoot me, i'm only the piano player !
2011-09-07T10:56:36  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-07T10:56:54  <delt0r> piano? why not bass?
2011-09-07T10:56:58  <delt0r> or drums...
2011-09-07T10:56:59  <delt0r> ;)
2011-09-07T10:57:04  <mcstar> you said: that's the point
2011-09-07T10:57:10  <mcstar> what is?
2011-09-07T10:57:23  <mcstar> you wrote: recursively, im stuck there
2011-09-07T10:57:28  <mcstar> what is recursive?
2011-09-07T10:57:44  <berak> iterating over a grid (double buffer) is only dependant on the map size
2011-09-07T10:58:06  <berak> while recursing over your ants ...
2011-09-07T10:58:07  <antimatroid> or you can treat your map like a graph :)
2011-09-07T10:59:26  <mcstar> hm
2011-09-07T10:59:41  <mcstar> influence maps != potential map
2011-09-07T10:59:43  <mcstar> s
2011-09-07T11:00:10  <mcstar> its not like evaluating a functions per ant then summing and writing it for every cell
2011-09-07T11:00:12  <berak> ahh, k
2011-09-07T11:00:20  <mcstar> -s
2011-09-07T11:00:42  <mcstar> the influence must flow you see
2011-09-07T11:00:44  <delt0r> mcstar: they are in fact very related...

2011-09-07T11:00:59  <delt0r> in fact the PDE is the same type
2011-09-07T11:00:59  <mcstar> theres a source, and there are obstacles in the map
2011-09-07T11:01:09  <mcstar> and the influence flows/dissipates
2011-09-07T11:01:19  <delt0r> yea.. there is a reason we have "potental flows"
2011-09-07T11:02:06  <mcstar> delt0r: theres a difference: time dependent diffusion vs iteratively solving the poisson equation
2011-09-07T11:02:09  <delt0r> the navier stokes equation reduces to Poisson equation in the invisid incompressible limit
2011-09-07T11:02:34  <mcstar> no, to the euler equation
2011-09-07T11:02:39  <mcstar> inviscid
2011-09-07T11:03:19  <delt0r> yea--you solve potentail flow... the you have a grad operator... sweet...
2011-09-07T11:03:53  <mcstar> what i really mean, is that the 2 processes are fundamentally different also, they seem similar
2011-09-07T11:03:55  <delt0r> mcstar: true with time dependance --however you can just add a time dimension... and use a "upwinding"
2011-09-07T11:04:20  <mcstar> im not really clear on the AI side though
2011-09-07T11:04:45  <delt0r> mcstar: the math can be --in many cases-- to be more or less ==... hence can use efficient solvers
2011-09-07T11:05:09  <mcstar> i read 2 tutorials, on the same thing, one used influence diffusion, the other just summed values on the map i think
2011-09-07T11:05:45  <delt0r> ? summed values?
2011-09-07T11:06:00  <delt0r> bit vague there
2011-09-07T11:06:31  <mcstar> the may reason for using some kind of diffusion, is that the resulting influence map will contain the geometry of the real map, like obstacles, corridors and such

2011-09-07T11:07:04  <mcstar> like evaluating a superposable potential

2011-09-07T11:07:41  <delt0r> yes?
2011-09-07T11:07:48  <mcstar> sure
2011-09-07T11:08:23  <delt0r> right so solving that with summation at each square is expensive compared to these grid methods
2011-09-07T11:08:44  <delt0r> if you only need it for a few squares... then well it works better
2011-09-07T11:09:13  <mcstar> not just that, when your potential is distance based, you essentially ignore obstacles(you can choose a defualt value for them)

2011-09-07T11:10:17  <mcstar> now try diffusion, or simply evaluate the potential as a function of the distance
2011-09-07T11:10:27  <delt0r> potential/PDE type things work with obstacles... they are "negative" sources... in a grid method, potential or flow is propogated through the grid
2011-09-07T11:10:27  <mcstar> you can clearly see the problem
2011-09-07T11:11:33  <mcstar> it seems you dont get what i say
2011-09-07T11:11:57  <mcstar> nvm
2011-09-07T11:12:07  <delt0r> The trick with propagation through the grid --is that these super grids propagate information over the grid faster..
2011-09-07T11:12:53  <delt0r> Oh i do... this does work... it is done with complicated geometry fluid and potential solvers all the time
2011-09-07T11:13:09  <delt0r> look em up
2011-09-07T11:13:11  <mcstar> you see, you dont :)
2011-09-07T11:13:22  <mcstar> what im saying is not really a potential solver
2011-09-07T11:13:32  <delt0r> niether is a fluid solver
2011-09-07T11:13:42  <delt0r> but its simmilar
2011-09-07T11:13:53  <mcstar> just get a function with compact support, put them in the sources, and sum up the values on the map
2011-09-07T11:14:02  <delt0r> the FDM PDE system of equations
2011-09-07T11:14:30  <mcstar> delt0r: i just wrote an fdm solver for the gpu
2011-09-07T11:14:36  <mcstar> but im not talking about that
2011-09-07T11:16:11  <mcstar> so this primitive method can be used too, for example to make ants spread out evenly in a volume(map)
2011-09-07T11:16:55  <mcstar> and it can be made more accurate, if you dont use the distance function, but actually use a pathfinding-based distance
2011-09-07T11:17:09  <mcstar> i.e. you dont cut through obstacles
2011-09-07T11:18:05  <mcstar> now delt0r pls give me a hint how to search for this supergrid method
2011-09-07T11:18:25  <mcstar> do they use this for solving relaxational problems?
2011-09-07T11:19:04  <mcstar> or is it rather a computer-science method?
2011-09-07T11:22:59  <mcstar> A Super-Grid-Scale Model for Simulating
2011-09-07T11:23:06  <mcstar> Compressible Flow on Unbounded Domains
2011-09-07T11:23:09  <delt0r> sorry... busy...
2011-09-07T11:23:13  <mcstar> delt0r: is that it?
2011-09-07T11:23:23  <delt0r> got the name wrong Multigrid

2011-09-07T19:09:39  <spacebat> hi, I've been to the website and there is no mention of this year's competition
2011-09-07T19:09:57  <spacebat> is there a better URL to find out where things are at?
2011-09-07T19:10:15  <antimatroid> @beta
2011-09-07T19:10:16  <contestbot> antimatroid: beta could be http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/.
2011-09-07T19:10:38  <spacebat> ok so the contest hasn't started
2011-09-07T19:10:42  <spacebat> thanks
2011-09-07T19:15:50  <mleise> no, it hasn't started
2011-09-07T19:54:28  <mleise> timeout with only 101 ants? http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=163853 FlagCapper should look over the code :)
