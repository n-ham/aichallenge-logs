2011-10-16T15:39:40  <mleise> I recommend a size where you get the squares all aligned on mpeg macroblocks (8x8 pixels) for best quality
2011-10-16T15:40:28  <mcstar> what are we supposed to see?
2011-10-16T15:40:38  <mcstar> (correction: amstan to see)
2011-10-16T15:40:52  <amstan> janzert: you around?
2011-10-16T15:41:23  <mleise> amstan: rows=86 cols=156 would be the perfect size
2011-10-16T15:41:55  <amstan> mleise: i was poking around in the mapgen to get different sizes, there's no way to make it output a specific map size
2011-10-16T15:42:03  <amstan> just ranges on both x and y(at the same time)
2011-10-16T15:42:08  <amstan> most of the time it'll output a square map
2011-10-16T15:42:32  <mleise> I'm just saying :)
2011-10-16T15:42:58  <mcstar> aham, so the news is the rendering itself
2011-10-16T15:48:33  <mleise> mcstar: Yes, the news is that the visualizer supports fixed frame rate output to compressed numbered image files using multi-threading.
2011-10-16T15:49:19  <mcstar> aham, so you make the movie from those images
2011-10-16T15:49:39  <mleise> yes, using ffmpeg in this case
2011-10-16T15:50:15  <mcstar> make the script available too, where the visualizer is
2011-10-16T15:50:20  <mcstar> but i guess you thought of that
2011-10-16T15:50:30  <mleise> what script?
2011-10-16T15:50:41  <mcstar> the parameterized ffmpeg call
2011-10-16T15:52:11  <mleise> I added a simple example in the help for the visualizer (java -jar visualizer.jar --help), that will work. But the quality can be improved with the right map size, image resolution and video format.
2011-10-16T15:54:11  <mleise> The final line I used was: ffmpeg -i %08d.png -vcodec libx264 -vpre lossless_max movie.mp4
2011-10-16T15:54:44  <mleise> Now it is in the channel logs for later reference :p

2011-10-16T15:57:48  <mcstar> yeah
2011-10-16T15:58:30  <mcstar> now you just have to make a readme "pls grep the logs for the exact video conversion call"
2011-10-16T15:59:21  <mcstar> i am proud of myself too, btw
2011-10-16T15:59:30  <mleise> If a video is going to be uploaded on YouTube there might be someone editing it, so its probably not simply a conversion call.
2011-10-16T15:59:36  <mcstar> i wrote a slow matrix multiplication c++ program
2011-10-16T15:59:49  <mleise> lol, at least it works
2011-10-16T16:00:07  <mleise> for what sizes of matrixes?
2011-10-16T16:00:28  <mcstar> well, i tested fot a 300x300 double prec. matrix, 10 times
2011-10-16T16:00:36  <mcstar> took 1.4 sec with -O3
2011-10-16T16:00:48  <mleise> ok, that's a huge one
2011-10-16T16:00:50  <mcstar> mathematica did it in 0.35sec
2011-10-16T16:01:26  <mcstar> the thing is, the matrix can be indexed like a 2d static array
2011-10-16T16:01:42  <amstan> mleise: why do you think someone will edit it?
2011-10-16T16:01:51  <mcstar> i guess, for internal operations, like multiplication, i will not use double indexing
2011-10-16T16:02:00  <mleise> mcstar: If you want to optimize you can try do reduce the number of divisions
2011-10-16T16:02:18  <mcstar> what divisions?
2011-10-16T16:02:39  <mleise> sorry, i was somewhere else -> inversion
2011-10-16T16:02:46  <mcstar> ah
2011-10-16T16:02:49  <mcstar> next step
2011-10-16T16:03:05  <mcstar> but i will do an LU decomposition to solve linear systems
2011-10-16T16:03:19  <mcstar> but maybe ill do inversion too
2011-10-16T16:03:39  <mcstar> anyway, this is my second object-oriented program
2011-10-16T16:03:51  <mleise> amstan: Create an intro saying "Goole AI challenge - Ants (sample gameplay)" or something and "Thanks for watching"

2011-10-16T16:04:56  <mcstar> its a good idea to make a video that will circulate among youtubers
2011-10-16T16:04:59  <amstan> or not.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwDKMiAfxFE&feature=player_embedded

2011-10-16T16:05:30  <mleise> ok, PlanetWars was more interesting to watch though. Ants could use some zoom in on an ant hill and other action.
2011-10-16T16:05:59  <amstan> this was done in tron

2011-10-16T16:08:54  <mcstar> not like that
2011-10-16T16:08:57  <mcstar> more turns per sec
2011-10-16T16:09:07  <mcstar> not more frames per turn
2011-10-16T16:09:46  <mcstar> im just saying, if it seems faster, than more things would happen, and the newbie would find the game more interesting
2011-10-16T16:09:48  <mleise> I know what you mean. The faster you play the replay, the more the per turn preparations weight.

2011-10-16T16:13:57  <mleise> Iterating over stl lists in C++ makes for very ugly code.

2011-10-16T16:16:16  <kire> they actually have nice solutions for it now
2011-10-16T16:16:30  <mleise> amstan: I was seeing that coming, and thought that the frame rate conversion would suck.
2011-10-16T16:16:52  <mleise> kire: c++11 ? is c++10 implemented yet?
2011-10-16T16:16:58  <amstan> hey.. that's what i used last time

2011-10-16T16:17:11  <amstan> and the visualizer last time was made in python, outputting bash colour commands
2011-10-16T16:17:16  <kire> c++11 is the finalized C++0x

2011-10-16T16:23:38  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-16T16:23:40  <mcstar> cptr+cptr
2011-10-16T16:23:55  <mcstar> since pointers cannot be added or multiplied
2011-10-16T16:24:11  <mleise> The language would become unreadable if simple things like that did something unexpected. It is good the way it is.
2011-10-16T16:24:16  <mcstar> i want to interpret this, as a something, that now only can be achieved with *cptr
2011-10-16T16:24:41  <mcstar> let say i have a matrix class, to be definite
2011-10-16T16:24:55  <mleise> Use a reference to the matrix then.
2011-10-16T16:24:56  <mcstar> and now multiplication looks like this:
2011-10-16T16:25:02  <mcstar> *mat * *mat
2011-10-16T16:25:07  <kire> mcstar: afaik only enums and classes are allowed
2011-10-16T16:25:24  <kire> and of course structs, but those are just classes with default public access
2011-10-16T16:25:30  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-16T16:25:54  <mcstar> mleise: what do you mean use a reference?
2011-10-16T16:26:04  <mcstar> i know what it is, i just dont understand how
2011-10-16T16:26:07  <mleise> How do you declare a reference in C++ again? Matrix& ? I think so. Matrix& a = ...; a * a;
2011-10-16T16:26:29  <kire> and actually C++11 discourages raw pointers in preference of wrapped pointers and references
2011-10-16T16:26:36  <mcstar> but my matrix class is dynamically created with new
2011-10-16T16:26:39  <mleise> you still have don't copy data, but can use the overloaded operator
2011-10-16T16:26:41  <mcstar> instantiated
2011-10-16T16:27:10  <mleise> Matrix& a = *new Matrix(...);  ?  :p
2011-10-16T16:27:21  <mcstar> i dont think that is correct
2011-10-16T16:27:25  <kire> no it's not
2011-10-16T16:27:51  <mcstar> whenever i use new, i have to use a pointer to store that address
2011-10-16T16:28:07  <mcstar> and theres no point in referencing that in any way i can see
2011-10-16T16:28:43  <mcstar> references are only good for function calls, makes them clearer, wrt to poitners
2011-10-16T16:28:50  <mcstar> -to
2011-10-16T16:29:25  <mcstar> anyway, i think i have my solution
2011-10-16T16:29:37  <mleise> why is it not correct what I wrote?!?
2011-10-16T16:29:57  <mleise> please explain
2011-10-16T16:30:31  <mcstar> =new type
2011-10-16T16:30:36  <mcstar> isnt this the correct syntax?
2011-10-16T16:30:42  <mcstar> what is = * ?
2011-10-16T16:30:54  <mleise> pointer dereference
2011-10-16T16:30:55  <mcstar> if you say its correct i believe you

2011-10-16T16:50:47  <mleise> kire: I have some hopes on D, but I hesitate to allocate memory on the heap to avoid the garbage collector. That is still a topic that comes up often, especially from real-time and game programmers.
2011-10-16T16:52:06  <mleise> amstan: does the error still pop up with local.properties in place? It should be the only problem on a new machine.
2011-10-16T16:52:42  <amstan> mleise: what?
2011-10-16T16:52:44  <kire> mleise: well, actually scoped_ptr is good at doing automatic deallocation as soon as your object goes out of scope, but it's a bit harder to cary over ownership (it uses new std::move and rvalue references). shared_ptr uses reference counters and therefore is a bit more subtle.
2011-10-16T16:52:49  <amstan> there's no local.properties
2011-10-16T16:53:02  <kire> But in general I find most game and real-time programmers exaggerate (I personally work on embedded hardware)
2011-10-16T16:53:25  <mleise> Look above ^. You need to give the build script a hint to the plugin.jar to compile against
2011-10-16T16:54:26  <kire> You've got loads of possiblities to define (de)allocation mechanisms for standard containers and such. But anyway, gtg, bye

2011-10-16T16:59:20  <mleise> amstan: If you use compiz and it uses a fair bit of CPU while rendering the images, try minimizing the visualizer and the console window. It worked for me. Maybe I should upgrade to Gnome 3 and forget about compiz.

2011-10-16T17:01:02  <mleise> It is two rows too high, but if you use a higher image and crop it later it should be good!

2011-10-16T17:02:39  <amstan> i guess i could run convert on everything

2011-10-16T17:02:53  <mleise> use that height instead of 720

2011-10-16T17:09:00  <mleise> let's see :)
2011-10-16T17:09:05  <mcstar> i think my solution will be to NOT use new, or references, but to stick with class-stack allocation, of course the matrix inside it is heap allocated, and i will need to overload the = operator, so i can store the result easily, and of course i need to add an empty constructor matrix()
2011-10-16T17:09:21  <amstan> mleise: kinda boring, what about: http://beta.aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=13821
2011-10-16T17:10:15  <mleise> that looks more interesting
2011-10-16T17:11:13  <amstan> if you watch these ant games backwards, they're about different colour ants producing offsprings who then proceed toward their individual hives
2011-10-16T17:11:19  <mleise> 90*8=720, hmm. so if you use 740 as the visualizer height and crop 10 pixels top/down it still fits in the video fully :)
2011-10-16T17:11:38  <amstan> ok, what about width?
2011-10-16T17:11:49  <mleise> amstan: Theoretically the games could be played backwards
2011-10-16T17:12:03  <mleise> the width... ok what is it?
2011-10-16T17:12:16  <amstan> for 720p at 16:9 it needs to be 1280
2011-10-16T17:12:28  <mleise> and the map has how many cols?
2011-10-16T17:13:24  <amstan> 144
2011-10-16T17:14:04  <mleise> 144*8=1152 , 1280-1152=128 -> 64 pixels shaded on each side
2011-10-16T17:14:44  <mleise> Sounds fair enough, so go with --width=1280 and --height=740 --decoration=false

2011-10-16T18:12:40  <mleise> amstan: I tried both VMs now and I don't see a difference in speed. A 1000 turn game would take around 12-13 minutes. Do you run 32-bit or 64-bit software?
2011-10-16T18:15:15  <mleise> It could be that the JavaScript part is heavy on 64-bit data types and doesn't run well in a 32-bit environment. But I'm not sure.

2011-10-16T18:55:15  <amstan> mleise: why?
2011-10-16T18:55:44  <mleise> it says "frames per turn" not per second. when you later create the video from it, you set the frames per second
2011-10-16T18:56:00  <amstan> well.. that would explain it
2011-10-16T18:56:03  <amstan> oh well
2011-10-16T18:56:06  <amstan> np, i got pizza in the meantime
2011-10-16T18:56:28  <mleise> 3 frames per turn played at 25 FPS -> 25/2 ~= 8 turns per second
2011-10-16T18:56:35  <mleise> sorry, 25/3
2011-10-16T18:57:54  <mleise> damn, now you got images for 1 turn/s ^^
2011-10-16T18:58:32  <mleise> or you can produce a 75 FPS movie for the refresh rate junkies

2011-10-16T19:15:07  <mleise> it will use a default of 25, you can use -r <fps> though
2011-10-16T19:15:15  <amstan> ok
2011-10-16T19:15:17  <amstan> good

2011-10-16T19:15:55  <amstan> mleise: you could have said about the crop option before aarosig made a script to convert all of them
2011-10-16T19:16:15  <mleise> hey I did say either ffmpeg or convert
2011-10-16T19:17:00  <mleise> (23:03:28) mleise: then use ffmpeg or convert to crop the first and last 8 pixels (which will align fine with 8 pixel macroblocks again)
2011-10-16T19:17:45  <amstan> yeah, but i went with convert instead
2011-10-16T19:17:54  <mleise> :)
2011-10-16T19:19:20  <mleise> just don't tell him about ffmpeg's crop ;)

2011-10-16T22:50:29  <amstan> but it'll take a while
2011-10-16T22:50:38  <amstan> and they'll have to be exact matches
2011-10-16T22:50:45  <amstan> and they won't be questions either
2011-10-16T22:51:23  <aarossig> amstan: if you do that... you could say that if a question is asked twice then it is a faq
2011-10-16T22:51:40  <amstan> aarossig: yes, but it's statistically irrelevant

2011-10-16T23:07:41  <amstan> so yeah, not a good source of frequently asked questions
2011-10-16T23:07:42  <aarossig> Answer: In what context?
2011-10-16T23:07:42  <aarossig> lol
2011-10-16T23:07:57  <aarossig> 2) In what context?
2011-10-16T23:08:10  <aarossig> Answer: I don't know, I'm just a silly FAQ. You tell me.
2011-10-16T23:08:14  <amstan> aarossig: i dare you to do what i just did in C
2011-10-16T23:08:16  <aarossig> I think we need cleverbot
2011-10-16T23:08:25  <aarossig> amstan: you got some library
2011-10-16T23:08:29  <aarossig> amstan: and used it
2011-10-16T23:08:30  <aarossig> lol
2011-10-16T23:08:32  <amstan> yes, it's in the other file
2011-10-16T23:08:58  <aarossig> heres what I suggest
2011-10-16T23:09:09  <aarossig> do as mcleopold suggested, take the question mark
2011-10-16T23:09:23  <aarossig> any message with more than two or even three spaces as well
2011-10-16T23:09:29  <aarossig> then see what you get
2011-10-16T23:09:46  <aarossig> since you can't really have a good faq question that has no spaces...
2011-10-16T23:10:28  <aarossig> you might be able to get away with even 6 or 7 spaces...
2011-10-16T23:10:31  <aarossig> n+1 words

2011-10-16T23:12:06  <amstan> still nothing relevant
2011-10-16T23:12:10  <aarossig> no, this is good
2011-10-16T23:12:13  <aarossig> get more spaces
2011-10-16T23:12:15  <amstan> problem is that all frequently asked questions are rephrased
2011-10-16T23:12:24  <aarossig> get more spaces
2011-10-16T23:12:28  <amstan> don't even look in the 2 section
2011-10-16T23:12:39  <amstan> that's just people sending it twice because of lag or something
2011-10-16T23:13:02  <aarossig> get like.. 6 or 7 spaces
2011-10-16T23:13:07  <amstan> aarossig: what will more spaces do? you already have the data
2011-10-16T23:13:09  <aarossig> you will probably filter out all the low quality questions
2011-10-16T23:13:21  <aarossig> isn't this just the top?
2011-10-16T23:13:35  <amstan> no, this is all questions from this year, with 3 or more words
2011-10-16T23:13:42  <aarossig> ah okay
2011-10-16T23:13:55  <aarossig> well
2011-10-16T23:13:58  <aarossig> you can read into it a little
2011-10-16T23:14:05  <aarossig> 3 what language are you using?
2011-10-16T23:14:13  <aarossig> FAQ: What languages are available?
2011-10-16T23:14:26  <amstan> that's people asking for questions without stating what they're coding in
2011-10-16T23:14:32  <amstan> so helpers usually start by asking that
2011-10-16T23:14:34  <aarossig> Answer: See the starter pack page and if you're not satisfied come and see us on IRC.
2011-10-16T23:15:05  <aarossig> 2 how is your bot doing?
2011-10-16T23:15:12  <aarossig> See the ranking page.
2011-10-16T23:15:17  <aarossig> see what I mean?
2011-10-16T23:15:20  <aarossig> just read into it a little
2011-10-16T23:16:03  <aarossig> but yeah, this is weak
2011-10-16T23:16:04  <aarossig> also..
2011-10-16T23:16:07  <aarossig> irc is for experts lol
2011-10-16T23:16:19  <aarossig> you need to build a faq using this exact script
2011-10-16T23:16:24  <aarossig> once you get the redditors in here
2011-10-16T23:16:28  <aarossig> with 500 people chatting
2011-10-16T23:16:38  <aarossig> your logging bot will provide you with some useful data at that point
2011-10-16T23:16:57  <amstan> aarossig: last year: http://pastebin.com/FQRKxMUh
2011-10-16T23:17:06  <amstan> aarossig: with 3 or more words
2011-10-16T23:17:10  <aarossig> yeah, that's cool
2011-10-16T23:17:29  <aarossig> you'll see
2011-10-16T23:17:31  <amstan> #check if serious question
2011-10-16T23:17:32  <aarossig> also.. reddit comments
2011-10-16T23:17:33  <amstan> if len(line[3].split())>2:
2011-10-16T23:18:02  <amstan> yeah, reddit comments will be good
2011-10-16T23:18:12  <amstan> the most upvoted is probably frequent

2011-10-16T23:20:43  <amstan> that i didn't go to their website
2011-10-16T23:21:01  <aarossig> amstan: i got in...
2011-10-16T23:21:10  <aarossig> but it's just a crappy guest account
2011-10-16T23:21:17  <aarossig> you just see *all* the jobs
2011-10-16T23:21:21  <aarossig> so you can't actually apply
2011-10-16T23:21:30  <aarossig> so retardedf
2011-10-16T23:21:34  <amstan> oh, screw that then
2011-10-16T23:21:39  <amstan> yeah, ok
2011-10-16T23:21:44  <aarossig> like..
2011-10-16T23:21:50  <aarossig> you can reply to ibm directly
2011-10-16T23:21:51  <aarossig> but not this
2011-10-16T23:21:54  <amstan> i'll have to actually apply to ibm jobs then, oh well, not a big deal, i saw like 2 that were interesting
2011-10-16T23:22:00  <aarossig> yeah
2011-10-16T23:22:10  <aarossig> what is annoying..
2011-10-16T23:22:13  <amstan> i can't believe i'm doing this over a site not working
2011-10-16T23:22:14  <aarossig> the login gateway responds
2011-10-16T23:22:25  <aarossig> but "too many users"
2011-10-16T23:22:44  <aarossig> i have a suggestion...
2011-10-16T23:22:48  <aarossig> for your irc srcript
2011-10-16T23:22:58  <aarossig> a lot of idiots come on irc and say "I have a question"
2011-10-16T23:23:03  <aarossig> there is no question mark in there
2011-10-16T23:23:10  <aarossig> maybe do a search
2011-10-16T23:23:16  <aarossig> and then return the following message written by them
2011-10-16T23:23:24  <aarossig> or like.. the following 3 messages
2011-10-16T23:23:30  <aarossig> i know from experience, being one of these idiots lol
2011-10-16T23:23:41  <aarossig> what do you think?
2011-10-16T23:23:50  <aarossig> because.. most people don't use proper grammar on here
2011-10-16T23:24:32  <aarossig> the exchange server is still running
2011-10-16T23:24:38  <aarossig> for mohawk email

2011-10-16T23:26:16  <amstan> 2011-03-30T08:44:26
2011-10-16T23:26:17  <amstan> 2011-04-15T19:15:48
2011-10-16T23:26:22  <amstan> timestamps ^
2011-10-16T23:26:31  <aarossig> yeah so?
2011-10-16T23:26:50  <aarossig> oh
2011-10-16T23:26:54  <aarossig> what about "what if"
2011-10-16T23:26:57  <aarossig> like..
2011-10-16T23:26:59  <aarossig> question words
2011-10-16T23:27:00  <aarossig> yes
2011-10-16T23:27:04  <aarossig> who what where when why how
2011-10-16T23:27:10  <aarossig> independently.. of course
2011-10-16T23:27:24  <aarossig> yes
2011-10-16T23:27:27  <aarossig> get question words
2011-10-16T23:29:26  <amstan> aarossig: huh?
2011-10-16T23:29:30  <aarossig> "who"
2011-10-16T23:29:33  <aarossig> "where"
2011-10-16T23:29:35  <aarossig> "what"
2011-10-16T23:29:36  <aarossig> and so on
2011-10-16T23:29:41  <amstan> what about them?
2011-10-16T23:29:41  <aarossig> "why" "how"
2011-10-16T23:29:50  <aarossig> use those as search terms instead of "?"
2011-10-16T23:30:11  <aarossig> and maybe make it minimum 2 words or something
2011-10-16T23:30:22  <aarossig> to filter out the "what?" messages
2011-10-16T23:30:27  <aarossig> minimum three even
2011-10-16T23:31:26  <amstan> aarossig: http://pastebin.com/R4kvy7BJ
2011-10-16T23:31:39  <aarossig> wow, decent
2011-10-16T23:31:45  <amstan> they're all 2 though
2011-10-16T23:31:50  <amstan> and they're too long to be coincidences
2011-10-16T23:31:53  <aarossig> yeah
2011-10-16T23:31:57  <amstan> so they're all doubles
2011-10-16T23:32:04  <aarossig> the three messages aren't that interesting

2011-10-16T23:32:42  <aarossig> okay, so we just exchange non-question information lol
2011-10-16T23:32:54  <aarossig> now... this might take a while... but what if you do this:
2011-10-16T23:32:56  *** ibdknox <ibdknox!~ibdknox@c-98-210-192-192.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-16T23:33:00  <aarossig> take all words that are say minimum 4 characters
2011-10-16T23:33:04  <aarossig> create a dictionary of them
2011-10-16T23:33:15  <aarossig> and then keep track of how many times the words come up
2011-10-16T23:33:25  <aarossig> and then return those messages with the higest ranked words
2011-10-16T23:33:30  <aarossig> say top 50 words or something
2011-10-16T23:33:38  <aarossig> they won't necessarily be questions
2011-10-16T23:33:48  <aarossig> but maybe just general conversations that were important
2011-10-16T23:33:52  <aarossig> that questions could arise about
2011-10-16T23:34:29  <aarossig> idk, what do you think?
2011-10-16T23:34:36  <aarossig> the output would be huge
2011-10-16T23:35:22  <aarossig> you can increase the minimum word size as well
2011-10-16T23:35:32  <aarossig> if you make it 6, your result would be smaller
