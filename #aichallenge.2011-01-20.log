2011-01-20T21:34:59  <amstan> sigh: markov trying to make a word?
2011-01-20T21:35:04  <amstan> sigh: faulty markov?
2011-01-20T21:35:06  <amstan> lol
2011-01-20T21:35:35  <sigh> well anything's possible if you assume the program is broken :P
2011-01-20T21:36:03  <sigh> even if you were constructing words I don't think this would be the result
2011-01-20T21:36:25  <chris_0076> maybe that should be the next challenge...
2011-01-20T21:36:36  <chris_0076> making the most turing complete bot ^^
2011-01-20T21:37:07  <sigh> entries will be evaluated by their forum posts
2011-01-20T21:37:22  <sigh> btw, that's not what turing complete means
2011-01-20T21:38:30  <chris_0076> hmm then what is the terminology for passing the turing test?
2011-01-20T21:38:42  <chris_0076> or rather being able to?
2011-01-20T21:39:13  <sigh> not sure that's got a term for itself
2011-01-20T21:40:38  <sigh> "passing the turing test" seems to be the simplest way of saying it :D
2011-01-20T21:41:18  <chris_0076> but, how can you comparatively quantify  "passing the turing test" vs being the most complete ^^
2011-01-20T21:41:37  <chris_0076> unless passing is graded on a 0-100 scale
2011-01-20T21:41:52  <chris_0076> with grade > 60 ==passing
2011-01-20T21:42:26  <sigh> turing complete refers to a completely separate thing, a turing complete language is one that can simulate a turing machine
2011-01-20T21:42:44  <chris_0076> <-- playing off words
2011-01-20T21:42:49  <chris_0076> ^^
2011-01-20T21:42:52  <sigh> :)
2011-01-20T21:46:42  <chris_0076> or I guess, retrospectively, grades are based on that they are x/100... so the higher the grade the more complete the whole is.
