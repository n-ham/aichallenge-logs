2010-11-28T00:00:35  <rebelxt_> i'm about to test one last parameter change ;-) maybe a miracle happens
2010-11-28T00:04:34  <phreeza_> i still like my bot because it looks absolutely disorganized but still manages to win some games.
2010-11-28T00:04:48  <phreeza_> reflects my character :D
2010-11-28T00:05:11  <Ken69267> mine miracally is ranking 1400ish and I crapped it together in like 12 hours
2010-11-28T00:05:14  <Ken69267> all hardcoded random logic
2010-11-28T00:05:30  <Ken69267> basically just nukes the closest thing to each planet if its growth is >= 3
2010-11-28T00:07:06  <rebelxt_> haha, Celica has a nice fireworks mode triggered a few turns before game loss
2010-11-28T00:07:23  <rebelxt_> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8822046 - last few turns are fun to watch..
2010-11-28T00:08:12  <Ken69267> heh, nice
2010-11-28T00:08:18  <phreeza_> heheh
2010-11-28T00:08:29  <wh1teside_> "crapped it together" = newest addition to my phrase library
2010-11-28T00:08:39  <phreeza_> "launch the escape pods, initiate self destrcuct sequence"
2010-11-28T00:09:14  <rebelxt_> hehe

2010-11-28T00:13:30  <Kingpin13> gah, wish you could upload more than one bot ;). Can not decide which version of mine works best D:
2010-11-28T00:13:52  <Ken69267> put them in a cagematch with each other
2010-11-28T00:13:54  <Ken69267> the survivor is
2010-11-28T00:14:14  <Kingpin13> yeah, but it's no good for testing, when they're both pretty much the same.

2010-11-28T00:15:25  <phreeza_> bit late for that anyway
2010-11-28T00:15:32  <rebelxt_> Kingpin, unless you had a chance to test both bots on tcp servers, pick one that dispatches example bots better/quicker
2010-11-28T00:15:51  <phreeza_> lets ask for an extension lol
2010-11-28T00:16:02  <Kingpin13> Phreeza, haha, it's never too late :P.
2010-11-28T00:16:17  <rebelxt_> i would mind. really need my life back asap!
2010-11-28T00:16:20  <phreeza_> j3camero: extension pretty please? :D
2010-11-28T00:16:35  <Kingpin13> rebelxt_, thanks for the suggestion, I'll try that, wish there were more example bots though
2010-11-28T00:17:13  <phreeza_> whats the pairing cutoff?
2010-11-28T00:17:18  <Ken69267> example bots beat mine occasionally -_-
2010-11-28T00:18:04  <janzert> phreeza_: for later in the finals as we limit the tournament to the top N bots
2010-11-28T00:18:28  <phreeza_> ah ok

2010-11-28T00:20:48  <rebelxt_> looking forward to seeing how fast elo scores stabilize once a cutoff is in place. was nice getting a rock solid position on tcp servers but it used to take 200+ games normally..
2010-11-28T00:21:12  <phreeza_> wow this guy submitted about 3000 times
2010-11-28T00:21:13  <phreeza_> http://ai-contest.com/profile_submissions.php?user_id=10464&page=1
2010-11-28T00:21:25  <phreeza_> Raschi
2010-11-28T00:22:28  <rebelxt_> wow.. was he trying to inflate ELO by re-submitting upon a loss?
2010-11-28T00:23:01  <phreeza_> i don't think so
2010-11-28T00:23:23  <janzert> yeah, I think he was just resubmitting every change
2010-11-28T00:23:24  <phreeza_> my guess is he had a hook set up with his git
2010-11-28T00:23:49  <rebelxt_> phreeza_: ahh interesting theory. a bad idea though ;-)
2010-11-28T00:24:05  <phreeza_> looks like he worked on it more or less constantly from Oct 3rd
2010-11-28T00:24:12  <Terr__> Kingpin13: Regarding multiple bots... In the suggestion thread in the forum there's an idea for that
2010-11-28T00:24:19  <phreeza_> i guess he deserves 11th then :)
2010-11-28T00:24:42  <sigh> he's updating like every 10 min o_O
2010-11-28T00:24:44  <Terr__> Basically, allow 2-3 concurrent bots per user, with one of them always marked "primary" and the only one which will make it into the final competition if they walk away
2010-11-28T00:24:55  <Terr__> Allows limited comparison testing
2010-11-28T00:25:19  <Kingpin13> Terr__, yeah sounds like a good idea, would have been ncie to have that :(
2010-11-28T00:25:47  <rebelxt_> Terr__: a good idea, but tcp servers would still be a much better tool for comparison testing

2010-11-28T00:31:14  <antimatroid1> i think the new tree idea was better but i decided against uploading it, should have tried it earlier
2010-11-28T00:32:30  <Terr__> You know what would make the next contest better?
2010-11-28T00:32:32  <Terr__> Two Rounds.
2010-11-28T00:32:36  <phreeza_> i'm off to sleep :) good luck everyone
2010-11-28T00:32:40  <antimatroid1> why two rounds?
2010-11-28T00:32:44  <rebelxt_> antimatroid1: so was it heuristic bot you uploaded?
2010-11-28T00:32:44  <Terr__> First is optional, but bragging rights anyway
2010-11-28T00:32:51  <antimatroid1> revelxt_: minimax
2010-11-28T00:32:55  <Terr__> antimatroid1: Procrastinators!
2010-11-28T00:33:18  <antimatroid1> why not three rounds? for the uber procrastinaros?
2010-11-28T00:33:20  <antimatroid1> ad infinitum
2010-11-28T00:33:38  <rebelxt_> antimatroid1: cool. two many pure heuristic bots out there ;)
2010-11-28T00:34:53  <Zannick> i wonder how many generations it would take a GP bot with no knowledge of the game to manage to play correctly to 200 turns
2010-11-28T00:35:03  <antimatroid1> my strategy is basically as follows, 1. cancel out any of their offensive moves that I can, 2. use minimax tree to pick my other main moves (don't get more than like 2-3 of those turns per move, the new idea gave more), 3. pick redistribution, done

2010-11-28T00:36:07  <Ken69267> its all about blindly spamming ships to their doom for me
2010-11-28T00:36:28  <Terr__> *slams head on desk as he sees where he reversed a heuristic calculation*
2010-11-28T00:36:47  <Ken69267> Terr__: you've got 20 minutes!
2010-11-28T00:36:57  <Ken69267> fix it
2010-11-28T00:38:30  <rebelxt_> antimatroid1: how deep can it search?
2010-11-28T00:38:44  <antimatroid1> not deep at all
2010-11-28T00:38:49  <janzert> we've hit 14 submissions in the compiler backlog now :/
2010-11-28T00:38:52  <antimatroid1> like 4-6 layers max i'd say
2010-11-28T00:39:08  <antimatroid1> janzert: i uplaoded a few minutes ago and it's already compiled
2010-11-28T00:39:15  <sigh> Zannick: what do you mean my "no knowledge"?
2010-11-28T00:39:22  <janzert> yep, it's still storming through them
2010-11-28T00:40:08  <Zannick> sigh: i mean start the generations with bots that only know to output a series of "%d %d %d\n" until a final line of "go\n", each turn
2010-11-28T00:40:27  <sigh> ok, I see
2010-11-28T00:40:32  <antimatroid1> GA doesn't sound like it'd work very well to me
2010-11-28T00:40:57  <Zannick> GP is crazy hilarious
2010-11-28T00:41:02  <Zannick> it's a GA that makes programs
2010-11-28T00:41:14  <Zannick> so it might take awhile
2010-11-28T00:41:18  <antimatroid1> if i did do it, i certainly would be trying to program some heuristics in
2010-11-28T00:41:31  <Zannick> but then again i don't plan to seriously compete in the next one, so
2010-11-28T00:41:54  <sigh> do we know what the next one is>
2010-11-28T00:41:57  <sigh> ?

2010-11-28T00:42:37  <antimatroid1> lol that is not promising, my final upload lost it's first nonofficial game to someone ranked in the 200's
2010-11-28T00:42:42  <sigh> still interesting to watch everyone else
2010-11-28T00:46:35  <janzert> looks like submission rate is slowing down. I wonder if we'll get another surge at the deadline.
2010-11-28T00:47:04  <rebelxt_> janzert: hopefully not ;-)
2010-11-28T00:47:33  <janzert> yeah, I hope too but I'm not sure that aligns with human nature :)

2010-11-28T00:54:22  <Terr__> I never hit the submit limit before...
2010-11-28T00:54:26  <amstan> janzert: can we disable that?
2010-11-28T00:54:30  <Terr__> And now I have to wait until after the contest.
2010-11-28T00:54:33  <Terr__> Huh.
2010-11-28T00:54:41  <Zannick> ooh, yeah that should get turned off
2010-11-28T00:54:49  <janzert> hmm?
2010-11-28T00:54:51  <antimatroid1> if you didn't compile that shouldn't have triggered?
2010-11-28T00:54:54  <amstan> janzert: disable upload limit
2010-11-28T00:55:03  <Terr__> Oh, it's screwed up, but not in compilation
2010-11-28T00:55:04  <antimatroid1> janzert: maybe leave submissions open 10 minutes extra?
2010-11-28T00:55:07  <antimatroid1> that'd sort it
2010-11-28T00:55:08  <amstan> antimatroid1: can compile but still be broken
2010-11-28T00:55:42  <amstan> nah, we can just take out the limit
2010-11-28T00:55:59  <amstan> it's not really applicable now
2010-11-28T00:56:19  <janzert> amstan: I'm afraid of the backlog growing to nasty sizes
2010-11-28T00:56:21  <Terr__> Don't worry on my account: My bot sucks either way
2010-11-28T00:56:25  <Terr__> Just...blarg.
2010-11-28T00:56:28  <amstan> janzert: make it one then
2010-11-28T00:56:34  <amstan> 1m
2010-11-28T00:56:42  <janzert> which will cause people to keep resubmitting since they didn't get a response

2010-11-28T00:57:36  <Zannick> the cs class i TAed in college wouldn't count a hw as a day late until 15 minutes after

2010-11-28T00:59:34  <Terr__> ABILITY TO SLEEP RESTORED
2010-11-28T00:59:37  <antimatroid1> amstan: read your emails
2010-11-28T00:59:48  <amstan> antimatroid1: i have emails? lol
2010-11-28T00:59:57  <janzert> amstan: shrug left about an hour ago said he'd be back by one
2010-11-28T01:00:20  <antimatroid1> sites down?
2010-11-28T01:00:26  <amstan> janzert: weird..
2010-11-28T01:00:31  <amstan> antimatroid1: shouldn't be
2010-11-28T01:00:33  <Zannick> everybody refreshed
2010-11-28T01:00:40  <Terr__> Quick idea to plant for participants: Merging code and methods to create the UBERBOT. (Or more likely, the spaghetticodebot.)
2010-11-28T01:00:40  <amstan> too many connections for mysql
2010-11-28T01:00:42  <amstan> lol
2010-11-28T01:00:48  <sanddbox> need better server <.<
2010-11-28T01:00:54  <amstan> yeah, lol
2010-11-28T01:00:54  <Zannick> no kidding
2010-11-28T01:00:55  <janzert> yeah, it's also doing it's on the hour stuff so wait a minute or two
2010-11-28T01:00:57  <sanddbox> edit the max connections in config
2010-11-28T01:01:01  <antimatroid1> Terr__: too much work/wouldn't work
2010-11-28T01:01:05  <rebelxt_> everyone, relax and stop refreshing ;-))
2010-11-28T01:01:06  <amstan> k, it's back
2010-11-28T01:01:24  <amstan> janzert: you tricky man: If you haven't submitted your final bot do so now!
2010-11-28T01:01:28  <Terr__> antimatroid1: I just feel bad, looking at all this code and knowing it'll be ophaned.
2010-11-28T01:01:57  <Zannick> i'm gonna open-source my terrible thing early dec.
2010-11-28T01:02:09  <janzert> :) gotta see what's happening with the compilation backlog here
2010-11-28T01:02:22  <amstan> janzert: of man, everyone's going to the forums now
2010-11-28T01:02:33  <Terr__> Now all I need to do is never ever reveal my bot name to avoid public shame.
2010-11-28T01:02:35  <rebelxt_> "Submissions will be closing shortly." janzert you are just too nice! ;-)
2010-11-28T01:03:17  <Zannick> i miss my mod powers
2010-11-28T01:03:26  <Zannick> there's a thread marked with unread posts
2010-11-28T01:03:34  <Zannick> but i go there and there aren't any!
2010-11-28T01:03:48  <antimatroid1> Terr__; all of my programs end up orphaned :P
2010-11-28T01:03:59  <janzert> Zannick: I get that too though
2010-11-28T01:04:08  <Terr__> Yeah
2010-11-28T01:04:13  <Terr__> the unread stuff isn't quite working right
2010-11-28T01:04:21  <Terr__> Several threads keep bugging me that way.
2010-11-28T01:04:31  <Zannick> my mod powers disappeared for some reason, and then i decided i wanted a new account with this name instead of the other one
2010-11-28T01:04:32  <antimatroid1> i hope to god my new bot was bug free
2010-11-28T01:04:41  <antimatroid1> i literally through that different game tree together today
2010-11-28T01:04:43  <Zannick> so it goes
2010-11-28T01:04:47  <amstan> Zannick: you're from google, right?
2010-11-28T01:04:52  <Terr__> antimatroid1: I know from the devil mine isn't ;)
2010-11-28T01:05:50  <Terr__> Something keeps screwing up my evaluation so that it likes high-pop low-growth distant neutral planets ;)
2010-11-28T01:05:54  <Zannick> amstan: aye
2010-11-28T01:06:02  <amstan> Zannick: k, you can have mods back
2010-11-28T01:06:06  <Zannick> hahaha
2010-11-28T01:06:14  <Zannick> what a great reason ;)
2010-11-28T01:06:17  <amstan> lol
2010-11-28T01:06:30  <amstan> i don't think i left anyone a mod
2010-11-28T01:06:40  <McLeopold> Nothing like a last minute untested code change submit.
2010-11-28T01:06:43  <Terr__> Well, stuff like that anyway. At this point a "fresh start rewrite" looks pretty good.
2010-11-28T01:06:47  <amstan> nvm, i guess jmcarthur and a1k0n_ were
2010-11-28T01:06:58  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: that's my style
2010-11-28T01:07:05  <Zannick> i mean, it's okay with me if i get mod powers for being a googler, or for being a contributor, or for planning to be an admin/contributor in the future
2010-11-28T01:07:09  <McLeopold> And mine, I just did it.
2010-11-28T01:07:10  <antimatroid1> 3 months of work and a last minute huge change, hopefully it pays off aha
2010-11-28T01:07:17  <Terr__> My "ragebot-esque random lunatic" version would've probably performed better because it'd get all the folks who didn't code anti-rage-ish behavior.
2010-11-28T01:07:20  <McLeopold> 2 minutes past the dealine I think...
2010-11-28T01:07:27  <antimatroid1> decent effort :)
2010-11-28T01:07:38  <antimatroid1> feeling as unconfident as me? :P
2010-11-28T01:07:49  <amstan> Zannick: i think you were mod before i did that behind the scenes stuff, so you should have been left as a mod
2010-11-28T01:07:56  <Terr__> Did anybody end up using "crazy math" as a method?
2010-11-28T01:07:59  <McLeopold> It turns out, I suck at AI.
2010-11-28T01:08:00  <Zannick> i think the first thing i coded in my bot was anti-ragebot
2010-11-28T01:08:01  <Terr__> Massive matrix transformations etc?
2010-11-28T01:08:02  <Ken69267> you take rage bot, but make it rage at entirely random planets
2010-11-28T01:08:03  <Ken69267> thats mine
2010-11-28T01:08:20  <Terr__> Ken69267: Platonic anger, Mr. Tulip?
2010-11-28T01:08:21  <Zannick> amstan: yeah, i was. but i'm on a new account "Zannick" now so as not to confuse people
2010-11-28T01:08:31  <amstan> what was the old one?
2010-11-28T01:08:36  <McLeopold> Actually, I think I just tuned by bot to play well on only certain map types.
2010-11-28T01:08:44  <sigh> amsta: bswolf
2010-11-28T01:08:45  <Zannick> amstan: bswolf
2010-11-28T01:08:50  <sigh> :p
2010-11-28T01:08:53  <Zannick> ha, someone else remembers
2010-11-28T01:08:53  <CryBaby> Stalemate: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8849319
2010-11-28T01:08:55  <antimatroid1> i'm not really sure how one would do any kind of matrix transformations
2010-11-28T01:08:57  <amstan> Zannick: right.. yeah.. you were a mod
2010-11-28T01:09:02  <amstan> medal of honour*
2010-11-28T01:09:08  <antimatroid1> most of my crazy methods were too slow
2010-11-28T01:09:14  <antimatroid1> linear programming was the slowest i tried
2010-11-28T01:09:28  <burny> red should send 24 at th 23
2010-11-28T01:09:30  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: bot building on the edge! i decided against last minute change
2010-11-28T01:09:45  <sanddbox> CryBaby: i lol'd
2010-11-28T01:09:49  <sanddbox> chaotic could have easily won
2010-11-28T01:10:23  <sanddbox> chaotic should have just taken over that 23 neutral
2010-11-28T01:10:26  <amstan> janzert: need any help?
2010-11-28T01:10:36  <janzert> submissions have finally worked the the final surge backlog
2010-11-28T01:10:41  <Terr__> I'm pleased to say my hybrid knapsacky narrowing-tree minimax future-steps-modeling crazy soft reference caching abomination at least runs.
2010-11-28T01:10:46  <janzert> amstan: not yet anyway
2010-11-28T01:11:24  <McLeopold> You just described my bot.
2010-11-28T01:11:28  <Terr__> If the code is a waste, I might try eeking out some value by posting a "Here's how it was supposed to work" thing on a blog.
2010-11-28T01:11:38  <Terr__> McLeopold: 'Cept yours WORKS, right? ;)
2010-11-28T01:11:39  <Zannick> amstan: cool, thanks
2010-11-28T01:11:53  <McLeopold> It plays a game, yes.
2010-11-28T01:12:03  <McLeopold> It also times out on the main servers. :(
2010-11-28T01:12:24  <rebelxt_> doh
2010-11-28T01:12:28  <sigh> :(

2010-11-28T01:12:54  <Terr__> My bot never connected to the TCP server nor was uploaded prior to yesterday: I worked for too long in a vacuum.
2010-11-28T01:12:57  <amstan> too bad mega's sleeping
2010-11-28T01:13:01  <Terr__> Like way too long.
2010-11-28T01:13:05  <amstan> he'll wake up in an hour or so
2010-11-28T01:13:12  <McLeopold> I lost a game I was winning to someone who was rank 22 earlier today.
2010-11-28T01:13:15  <Terr__> Architecture astronautics dooms another of my projects.
2010-11-28T01:13:45  <antimatroid1> Terr__: i did that for tron
2010-11-28T01:13:51  <antimatroid1> was alright for that, not for this :P
2010-11-28T01:14:06  <antimatroid1> didn't wait till the very last day, but worked for most of the time locally
2010-11-28T01:14:28  <rebelxt_> now that this contest is over, is minecraft really really worth checking it out? lol
2010-11-28T01:14:36  <antimatroid1> haha, that's my plan
2010-11-28T01:14:37  <amstan> yes!
2010-11-28T01:14:38  <antimatroid1> apparently yes

2010-11-28T01:14:49  <Terr__> antimatroid1: I imagine it was because it was less "fuzzy" in terms of reactions
2010-11-28T01:14:54  <janzert> and all submissions have compiled
2010-11-28T01:15:00  <Terr__> antimatroid1: Easier to code in a unit test when the "right" action is much easier to verify

2010-11-28T01:16:28  <Terr__> When I go to wikipedia all the math symbols put me to sleep.
2010-11-28T01:16:34  <antimatroid1> :( i love maths
2010-11-28T01:16:38  <jaman4dbz> haha, it has uses in graphics.

2010-11-28T01:16:47  <jaman4dbz> oh and eigenvectors are very useful in graph theory
2010-11-28T01:16:51  <sigh> it has uses in everything!
2010-11-28T01:16:54  <antimatroid1> one can never know too much linear algebra, true fact
2010-11-28T01:17:02  <jaman4dbz> i agree with this statement
2010-11-28T01:17:04  <rebelxt_> lol at topic
2010-11-28T01:17:07  <Terr__> jaman4dbz: Yeah, and I've got a shitload of graphs in my bot :(
2010-11-28T01:17:11  <jaman4dbz> calculus on the other hand... ewwwwww
2010-11-28T01:17:20  <Snowplan> ehh that sucks I was trying to make a last minute edit and the file i sent didn't compile
2010-11-28T01:17:22  <antimatroid1> calculus of variations was fun
2010-11-28T01:17:29  <Zannick> awww
2010-11-28T01:17:31  <amstan> Snowplan: it'll default to the previous one
2010-11-28T01:17:38  <amstan> Snowplan: if you had a compile error
2010-11-28T01:17:40  <Zannick> google isn't doing very well :P
2010-11-28T01:17:47  <Terr__> jaman4dbz: I took calculus... didn't like it, but I get what it does. All the set/combinatorics/etc. is far more daunting to me
2010-11-28T01:17:51  <antimatroid1> Terr__: were you creating subgraphs?
2010-11-28T01:17:58  <antimatroid1> i considered trying something like that, but meh
2010-11-28T01:18:09  <Snowplan> Id like it to be 3 because the last one crashed
2010-11-28T01:18:11  <jaman4dbz> haha graphs and subgraphs... You didn't really need any of that.
2010-11-28T01:18:11  <Terr__> antimatroid1: OK, so all planets were a heavily connected graph (no X/Y positions)
2010-11-28T01:18:15  <Snowplan> o well

2010-11-28T01:19:25  <jaman4dbz> I'm curious, did anyone else just transform the backpack problem for choosing planets to attack?
2010-11-28T01:19:26  <Terr__> antimatroid1: Any node combined with a Set of fleet-moves could be used to calculate the next, etc.
2010-11-28T01:19:37  <jaman4dbz> *transform = reduce... ya know what i mean
2010-11-28T01:19:52  <Terr__> antimatroid1: States of a node were stored in a Map<Set<Fleet>,Outcome>

2010-11-28T01:20:23  <sigh> jaman4dbz: there was a post about it in the forum early in the competion, so I imagine many people tried it
2010-11-28T01:20:35  <jaman4dbz> makes sense
2010-11-28T01:20:45  <Terr__> antimatroid1: There were a few other tricks, but I think I made a very effective way to say: "What would everything look like if I did this"
2010-11-28T01:20:57  <Terr__> antimatroid1: The problem is my code doesn't ask good questions ;)

2010-11-28T01:22:14  <antimatroid1> game tree
2010-11-28T01:22:24  <Terr__> I think my max future modeling ended up being 2x the max travel distance
2010-11-28T01:22:36  <antimatroid1> i just throw moves down each branch, copy state, add moves, update, then continue
2010-11-28T01:22:46  <antimatroid1> i just did up to maxdistance in the end
2010-11-28T01:22:57  <antimatroid1> i originally did up to 2*maxdistance

2010-11-28T01:23:14  <Terr__> Well, I had a minimax-ish thing that had depth 1x, and then at each step it would proceed by 1x assuming no changes in order to calculate how "happy" it was.
2010-11-28T01:23:14  <antimatroid1> but i figured the games changed so much by then anyway, why even bother
2010-11-28T01:23:52  <Terr__> Ironically when I started, I said: "Steer, don't plan!" and ended up making a planning system. Discipline fail.
2010-11-28T01:24:23  <antimatroid1> hehe
2010-11-28T01:24:36  <jaman4dbz> you can't control the code! It does what it wants!
2010-11-28T01:25:01  <jaman4dbz> man I'm so disappointed... I had so many plans... and just got stuck on infinite bugs... I fail at debugging.
2010-11-28T01:25:18  <antimatroid1> i just got a new game?
2010-11-28T01:25:19  <Terr__> "Maybe being ignorant of the field will let me do great because I don't know what 'can not be done'!" --> Nope.
2010-11-28T01:25:21  <jaman4dbz> I murdered a small tree to write down all of my algorithms... that tree died for nothing!
2010-11-28T01:25:31  <antimatroid1> janzert: shouldn't games have stopped running?
2010-11-28T01:25:34  <jaman4dbz> ah dang... lol
2010-11-28T01:25:35  <sigh> infinite bugs :( were they at least countable?
2010-11-28T01:25:38  <Terr__> jaman4dbz: I have all these scribbled "timelines" of fleet movements
2010-11-28T01:25:42  <Terr__> Graph paper FTW
2010-11-28T01:26:04  <jaman4dbz> Terr__: haha awesome
2010-11-28T01:26:06  <Terr__> X axis : planets, Y axis: time. Variously-angled lines connecting points along planet-lines.
2010-11-28T01:26:09  <jaman4dbz> fyi i fail at IRC
2010-11-28T01:26:43  <Terr__> Not exactly a "parallel graph", but it looked very similar
2010-11-28T01:26:44  <jaman4dbz> mine were just ideas into ensuring all of my planets were defended... and then ideas to tricky enemys who would do very robotic things like going for the perfect move.
2010-11-28T01:26:50  <antimatroid1> ha, just in time i made first for australia at closing of submissions aha
2010-11-28T01:26:54  <jaman4dbz> I really wasn't thinking very systematically =P
2010-11-28T01:27:08  <jaman4dbz> nice! Congrats dude.
2010-11-28T01:27:19  <antimatroid1> Terr__: it sounds like we did a lot of things the same
2010-11-28T01:27:21  <Terr__> Ex: http://filer.case.edu/~dbh10/eecs466/pGraph.png
2010-11-28T01:27:27  <antimatroid1> McLeopold used excel
2010-11-28T01:27:29  <jaman4dbz> I was like 36th in Canada... not quiet what i was hoping.
2010-11-28T01:27:31  <antimatroid1> i really should have too, but oh wel
2010-11-28T01:27:44  <jaman4dbz> wow
2010-11-28T01:27:53  <Terr__> It looks like that
2010-11-28T01:28:19  <antimatroid1> oh maybe not
2010-11-28T01:28:34  <antimatroid1> i considered trying discrete 3d graphs like that
2010-11-28T01:28:38  <antimatroid1> but never tried it
2010-11-28T01:28:50  <janzert> the final open period rankings aren't quite finished running yet
2010-11-28T01:28:58  <Neverstu> did you guys test against alternate/legacy versions of your bots? i did that for a while but found the data to be almost useless. winning against myself does not mean anything as it turns out.
2010-11-28T01:29:07  <Terr__> antimatroid1: the Y axis was time (one turn per unit) while the X axis had no real measurement, all "travel times" were expressed by the slope of the connecting lines
2010-11-28T01:29:14  <jaman4dbz> I used that alot neverstu
2010-11-28T01:29:17  <jaman4dbz> that was all i had =p
2010-11-28T01:29:25  <jaman4dbz> how else would I know to even bother submitting.
2010-11-28T01:29:49  <davidjliu> good night all
2010-11-28T01:29:51  <jaman4dbz> I tried so hard to convince my friends to join this competition, but they are SOOOO lazy.

2010-11-28T01:30:03  <jaman4dbz> night random guy i never said hello to.
2010-11-28T01:30:09  <davidjliu> heh
2010-11-28T01:30:11  <Neverstu> i kept it up for major regression checking, but generally then i had to re-create official matches or hit the TCP server to get reasonable data
2010-11-28T01:30:12  <Terr__> My god... I CAN PLAY VIDEO GAMES AGAIN!

2010-11-28T01:35:24  <Neverstu> my feeder algorithm was bolted on in a very bad way...did anyone have feeders/supply lines emerge from offense naturally?

2010-11-28T01:35:30  <McLeopold> :)
2010-11-28T01:35:30  <Zannick> i already have an ircbot that works, though i know supybot has been around for a lot longer
2010-11-28T01:35:37  <Neverstu> i was hoping for that, but i never found a good formulation
2010-11-28T01:36:02  <antimatroid1> Neverstu: i sort of did
2010-11-28T01:36:04  <Terr__> Neverstu: My attempts to make "PlanetRank" kept hitting a wall.
2010-11-28T01:36:07  <McLeopold> Neverstu: I have an idea for that, but I never got around to it.
2010-11-28T01:36:23  <sanddbox> Terr__, planetrank?
2010-11-28T01:36:23  <Terr__> On account of being an eigenvector ignoramus ;)
2010-11-28T01:36:30  <antimatroid1> if i added fleets at time 0 and sent them later, i would see if i could send them to a friend closer to the enemy and have the fleet make it's final journey in time
2010-11-28T01:36:34  <janzert> btw, the final rankings have from the open tournament have finished
2010-11-28T01:36:36  <Terr__> sanddbox: Like Google's "PageRank" but not at all like it.
2010-11-28T01:36:56  <sanddbox> not sure how backlinks apply to planets xD
2010-11-28T01:36:59  <antimatroid1> janzert: )
2010-11-28T01:37:04  <sanddbox> i ranked planets with a simple formula
2010-11-28T01:37:12  <antimatroid1> i snuck into 41st
2010-11-28T01:37:27  <Terr__> sanddbox: Well, a 5 planet right next to a 4 planet is more powerful than one farther away
2010-11-28T01:37:28  <jaman4dbz> ya I was sorta wondering how others ranked their planets as well
2010-11-28T01:37:30  <sanddbox> Distance(home.PlanetID(), expansion.PlanetID())) - (2 * expansion.GrowthRate()) + (expansion.NumShips() / 10))
2010-11-28T01:37:41  <Terr__> sanddbox: Because the advantage is worn down by the travel time
2010-11-28T01:37:41  <Terr__> Just an example
2010-11-28T01:37:44  <sanddbox> but i only found out about this two days ago so it's not like i had time to make it advanced
2010-11-28T01:37:54  <jaman4dbz> ah
2010-11-28T01:37:55  <antimatroid1> my ranking of planets was as follows, maximise growth, then minimise average distance to enemies
2010-11-28T01:38:05  <sanddbox> Terr__, that's why i just incorporated distance into my ofrmula
2010-11-28T01:38:07  <jaman4dbz> mine literally just found the worth of the planet according to how long it took me to get there
2010-11-28T01:38:12  <sigh> Terr__: I tried eigenvector centrality, but couldn't figure ut a ggood way of using the data

2010-11-28T01:38:28  <jaman4dbz> so you'd call the function giving it the two planets, and it would know how long it would take, and therefor how much growth it would get out of it.
2010-11-28T01:38:29  <Terr__> sigh: I tried egenvector centrality, but then I realized I didn't really know what that meant ;)
2010-11-28T01:38:29  <sanddbox> i just factored in growth, distance, and ships defending
2010-11-28T01:38:34  <McLeopold> I have no planet rankings, maybe that's my problem.
2010-11-28T01:38:36  <sigh> Terr__: haha
2010-11-28T01:38:39  <jaman4dbz> so you'd say 20 turns and if it took 5 turns it would only get 15 turns worth.
2010-11-28T01:38:55  <Terr__> sigh: This is one of the few times I look back and say: "Gosh, I wish I took all those hard CS courses"
2010-11-28T01:38:57  <jaman4dbz> Terr__: lmao, awesome!
2010-11-28T01:39:00  <Neverstu> the only planet ranking i did was on turn 1 - i calculated a weighting of each planet to the chord between each pair of planets. this gives a rough idea of which planets will be useful "on the way" to other planets.
2010-11-28T01:39:00  <rebelxt_> Neverstu: same for me.. ship re-distribution is its own separate algorithm using enemy proximity and ship counts into account
2010-11-28T01:39:05  <Terr__> As opposed to a slightly moer wishy-washy degree.
2010-11-28T01:39:19  <jaman4dbz> Neverstu: haha one of my profs from Windsor did that
2010-11-28T01:39:34  <Neverstu> for all other rankings, the planets were ranked according to the attack plans for them, not in isolation
2010-11-28T01:39:39  <jaman4dbz> Terr__: apparently its some alien searching algorithm or something
2010-11-28T01:39:39  <burny> games not being played anymore?
2010-11-28T01:39:44  <sigh> Terr__: it's like... assume your randomly go from planet to planet, following the links with the highest weight more often... where are you likely to end up
2010-11-28T01:39:55  <sigh> that's one way of looking at it

2010-11-28T01:40:43  <Terr__> sigh: Yeah, I'm just sayinig I don't have the terminology down. Maybe it's just in my head, but it seems like 99% of the resources I can find are all geared for math-heads rather than coders.
2010-11-28T01:40:43  <antimatroid1> especially janzert
2010-11-28T01:40:44  <jaman4dbz> But ya, that pairing algorithm... my old prof spent like 3 hours making a bot and beat the one I spent 2 days on... I was impressed.

2010-11-28T01:41:48  <sanddbox> seriously, all you really need is a good understanding of algebra, logic, and possibly statistics

2010-11-28T01:42:10  <antimatroid1> Terr__: all that maths crap is usually just notation
2010-11-28T01:42:14  <Terr__> sanddbox: Later I had to teach myself things like formal grammars (ANTLR) etc.
2010-11-28T01:42:16  <jaman4dbz> I wasted days trying to think of an effecient way for me to reduce the backpack problem to attacking from multiple planets to multiple planets

2010-11-28T01:42:22  <jaman4dbz> FYI I don't think it's feasible...
2010-11-28T01:42:33  <Terr__> antimatroid1: And I hateses it. It burneses poor gollum.
2010-11-28T01:42:40  <jaman4dbz> if it was feasible though it would be the gaurenteed best planets to take =P
2010-11-28T01:42:44  <jaman4dbz> gaurenteed as in proven.
2010-11-28T01:42:46  <antimatroid1> i love notation
2010-11-28T01:42:57  <sanddbox> i'm only a freshman in HS (:/) but i plan to go into AI
2010-11-28T01:43:06  <antimatroid1> i do wish there was a standard relation for "is a sequence in"
2010-11-28T01:43:09  <sanddbox> it's really the only CS field that still has a lot of room for work
2010-11-28T01:43:11  <jaman4dbz> lol your crazy sanddbox
2010-11-28T01:43:17  <sanddbox> you're*
2010-11-28T01:43:21  <sanddbox> <3
2010-11-28T01:43:21  <jaman4dbz> that's pretty early.
2010-11-28T01:43:28  <jaman4dbz> ya ya... pft.
2010-11-28T01:43:38  <antimatroid1> sanddbox: do maths and cs for undergrad, don't try to specialise that early
2010-11-28T01:43:42  <rebelxt_> Neverstu: you should do a write-up on your algorithm later. i'd be interested to read how you took attack plans into account when ranking planets etc
2010-11-28T01:43:43  <jaman4dbz> also sanddbox that is not at all true.
2010-11-28T01:43:52  <Terr__> sanddbox: Get a job doing intranet site utilities and crap and THEN tell me algebra/logic/statistics is all you need ;P
2010-11-28T01:44:08  <jaman4dbz> their are tons of fields were CS can evolve

2010-11-28T01:46:04  <sanddbox> any hints as to what the next ai challenge will be?
2010-11-28T01:46:04  <rebelxt_> would be interesing to see if anyone managed to take knapsack to the next level.. i.e. using integer programming for move scheduling, ship distribution
2010-11-28T01:46:06  <sanddbox> :D
2010-11-28T01:46:40  <CryBaby> Jenga
2010-11-28T01:46:56  <Terr__> rebelxt_: I wanted to, but I couldn't see a clear way to express it and use a solving library. (It's probably doable, just not by me.)
2010-11-28T01:46:58  <rebelxt_> i guess many of use are using knapsack for the first turn.. but it got so messy trying to use it with move scheduling required to do attack coordination
2010-11-28T01:47:01  <antimatroid1> sanddbox: i would guess somewhere near the start of next year
2010-11-28T01:47:04  <sanddbox> rebelxt_, how exactly does the knapsack problem relate to this contest?
2010-11-28T01:47:16  <sanddbox> antimatroid1, wat
2010-11-28T01:47:21  <sanddbox> the next ai challenge is the start of next year?
2010-11-28T01:47:29  <antimatroid1> the last one was earlier this year
2010-11-28T01:47:32  <sanddbox> i mean what the challenge actually is
2010-11-28T01:47:34  <sanddbox> not when it begins
2010-11-28T01:47:34  <margoth> i'm not sure if knapsack as such is applicable
2010-11-28T01:47:35  <sanddbox> :P
2010-11-28T01:47:36  <Terr__> rebelxt_: I wonder if flow algorithms... nah, everything is too dependent on +/-1 values
2010-11-28T01:47:47  <antimatroid1> oh, it hasn't even been considered properly
2010-11-28T01:47:54  <margoth> you can use it to expend all your ships but that might not be the best move
2010-11-28T01:48:31  <rebelxt_> sandbox, many are using knapsack to pick best planets to hit on first turn
2010-11-28T01:48:44  <sigh> margoth: sure, but I don't think *anyne* found the best move :P
2010-11-28T01:48:53  <Terr__> margoth:
2010-11-28T01:49:10  <margoth> there is no "best" move, only moves that might be better than others
2010-11-28T01:49:12  <Terr__> margoth: The "best" move depends on what the opponent does... and you can't see that or react except one turn later
2010-11-28T01:49:23  <Terr__> er, that was to sigh
2010-11-28T01:49:36  * Terr__ wonders about sleeping
2010-11-28T01:49:39  * Terr__ is out of practice
2010-11-28T01:49:44  <rebelxt_> is anyone using simulated annealing to calculate best possible way to expand (or simple hill climbing)?
2010-11-28T01:50:33  <margoth> anyway, I tried to use knapsack to produce different solution candidates but couldn't make it produce any improvement
2010-11-28T01:50:38  <Terr__> No, but I did seek out dubiously-legal torrents of scanned AI/algorithm e-books. And stayed at a Holday Inn Express.
2010-11-28T01:50:39  <rebelxt_> "best possible way" - i mean to get a good approximation of course since it's NP hard problem like TSP
2010-11-28T01:50:58  <rebelxt_> Terr__: lol
2010-11-28T01:51:47  <rebelxt_> Terr__: "Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach"?
2010-11-28T01:51:59  <Terr__> Hmmmm... Supreme Commander 2 on Steam for 3.75
2010-11-28T01:52:02  <margoth> I decided to abandon complex far reaching strategies as I had limited time and I assumed that whatever the opponent does will destroy my plans anyhow
2010-11-28T01:52:03  <sanddbox> rebelxt_: XD
2010-11-28T01:52:06  <sanddbox> that's the one i torrented about a month ago

2010-11-28T01:52:23  <margoth> that's why my bot doesn't save any calculations to the next turn
2010-11-28T01:53:01  <Terr__> rebelxt_: No, but I may have gone through it from the library.not sure.

2010-11-28T01:53:27  <jaman4dbz> I sorta missed a lot, but I can say that the knapsack provided a perfect solution, but only in the context you gave it.
2010-11-28T01:53:28  <burny> anyone know when we can start seeing the final things: and when it'll be done?
2010-11-28T01:53:49  <rebelxt_> a great book. i even thought it was gonna help "solve" planet wars ;-))
2010-11-28T01:53:51  <Terr__> sanddbox: I agree to a point: A book is awesome for absorbing information, but when it comes to troubleshooting etc. the ability to do a fulltext search is *invaluable*

2010-11-28T01:54:09  <jaman4dbz> for example if you had a function that calculated how many ships you could gain from a planet if you tried to take it and plugged that into the knapsack algorithm, then you would have the maximum solution for that number of turns.

2010-11-28T01:58:22  <margoth> if money be problem, at least pay for indie games
2010-11-28T01:58:22  <Terr__> rebelxt_: Makes it less interesting AI-wise though

2010-11-28T01:59:16  <margoth> now, if passing fleets would fire at one another, _that_ would make it ai-worthwhile
2010-11-28T01:59:22  <margoth> albeit a bit more complex
2010-11-28T01:59:33  <jaman4dbz> complex...
2010-11-28T01:59:34  <jaman4dbz> yes.
2010-11-28T01:59:54  <jaman4dbz> one of the hooks that got me into this contest was how simple it was =P
2010-11-28T02:00:11  <Terr__> margoth: From what I know of Galcon there are... aspects to it which an AI player could do too much more effectively than a human player.
2010-11-28T02:01:19  <Terr__> margoth: Similar to bots having unbeatable aim in FPS games, a galcon bot could micromanage things so that their ships dove into a planet at the exact moment of weakness... or continually hovered between two destinations... or could super-accurately estimate the normally-hidden numbers of ships at planets.

2010-11-28T02:12:01  <Terr__> I think the problem with git is--as many have mentioned--that there's a sort of mental-model mismatch
2010-11-28T02:12:17  <amstan> Terr__: how so?
2010-11-28T02:12:19  <Terr__> And right now it just isn't quite compelling enough for me to move my one-person stuff to it

2010-11-28T02:24:29  <janzert> no idea, I wasn't really around till after the contest started
2010-11-28T02:25:16  <NannerBflizzle> Probably a dumb question, but how do I use the contestBot that amstan put up?
2010-11-28T02:25:49  <amstan> NannerBflizzle: depends on what you want to do
2010-11-28T02:26:22  <NannerBflizzle> use the plugin
2010-11-28T02:26:30  <amstan> oh
2010-11-28T02:26:36  <amstan> @rankings
2010-11-28T02:26:37  <NannerBflizzle> or get rankings

2010-11-28T03:00:58  <antimatroid1> awesome
2010-11-28T03:01:13  <sigh> missed nothing?
2010-11-28T03:01:18  <antimatroid1> no games yet
2010-11-28T03:01:21  <antimatroid1> i went out for a bit
2010-11-28T03:01:31  <sigh> ah, so did I
2010-11-28T03:01:48  <antimatroid1> i made a big risk with my submission
2010-11-28T03:01:56  <antimatroid1> hopefully i at least get 1st for australia
2010-11-28T03:03:22  <margoth> I'm hoping to land finnish #1, a long shot
2010-11-28T03:04:42  <antimatroid1> ha, i gave up that hope a while ago
2010-11-28T03:05:14  <Neverstu> what was the risk? a big last-minute change?
2010-11-28T03:05:23  <sigh> antimatroid1: you wanted finnish #1? o_O
2010-11-28T03:05:49  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-11-28T03:06:11  <antimatroid1> i spent some time in first for tron before the final contest
2010-11-28T03:06:12  <margoth> yeah, finnish #1 is the best!
2010-11-28T03:06:21  <antimatroid1> it was really disappointing when we got disqualified
2010-11-28T03:06:54  <sigh> antimatroid1: do you realise that finnish is a nationality and not a verb?

2010-11-28T03:07:32  <Neverstu> doh! i forced myself to submit yesterday and not touch it today. the rankings were a complete mess today, impossible to figure out if you've made any improvements
2010-11-28T03:07:52  <margoth> I actually rolled back my last submission
2010-11-28T03:08:27  <margoth> my own tests kinda said it wasn't as good as the latest but... with no proper benchmarking I decided to rely on hunch
2010-11-28T03:08:39  <Neverstu> probably a wise choice

2010-11-28T03:10:54  <antimatroid1> i implemented a completely new tree idea today and submitted it without any real testing :P
2010-11-28T03:11:33  <antimatroid1> it shouldn't be that different to my others anyway
2010-11-28T03:11:49  <Neverstu> holy cow
2010-11-28T03:12:29  <antimatroid1> it seemed better, so i thought fuck it :p
2010-11-28T03:12:29  <Neverstu> i had a number of bugs that i left in intentionally, because they turned other bugs into nice features :) "fixing" them would upset the whole house of cards
2010-11-28T03:12:57  <antimatroid1> i also went for an agressive bot
2010-11-28T03:13:18  <sigh> antimatroid1: where do you think your bot will place?
2010-11-28T03:13:23  <sigh> any chance at top 10?
2010-11-28T03:13:26  <antimatroid1> in that it will send offensive moves to arrive whenever (provided it's not as they claim a neutral
2010-11-28T03:13:32  <antimatroid1> sigh: doubtful
2010-11-28T03:13:35  <antimatroid1> top 30 would be nice
2010-11-28T03:13:41  <sigh> ah, too bad
2010-11-28T03:13:45  <antimatroid1> i can beat iouri, accoun etc. sometimes
2010-11-28T03:13:48  <sigh> col
2010-11-28T03:13:50  <sigh> *cool
2010-11-28T03:13:51  <antimatroid1> but it loses to some crap bots too
2010-11-28T03:14:30  <antimatroid1> i have no idea what the competition is like on the main site though, i haven't had a bot run on there in like a month
2010-11-28T03:14:40  <Neverstu> the rock-paper-scissors nature of this problem is a bit irritating. it's hard to get any real consistency (though clearly some have done it)
2010-11-28T03:15:31  <sigh> Neverstu: there was never much stability in the rankings
2010-11-28T03:15:39  <antimatroid1> except for first place*
2010-11-28T03:15:42  <sigh> :)
2010-11-28T03:15:48  <Neverstu> indeed :)

2010-11-28T03:16:54  <antimatroid1> i don't think any bots are anywhere near optimal
2010-11-28T03:16:58  <antimatroid1> it's a really really hard problem
2010-11-28T03:17:06  <sigh> yeah
2010-11-28T03:17:11  <Neverstu> it's remarkable that at first it seems so simple too
2010-11-28T03:17:16  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-11-28T03:17:24  <antimatroid1> was a wondeful choice of game
2010-11-28T03:17:28  <sigh> heh, I never thought it was simple o_O
2010-11-28T03:17:28  <Neverstu> only after starting to analyze the tree you realize how unbelieveably hopeless it is
2010-11-28T03:17:58  <antimatroid1> lol, the actual game tree is so big you can't even touch the first layer
2010-11-28T03:18:13  <Neverstu> well "simple" is an overstatement, but i think given the number of contestants it certainly has a casual appeal, as if a few hours of work could generate a decent bot
2010-11-28T03:18:54  <sigh> it's simple in that it has a fairly low barrier for entry

2010-11-28T03:19:20  <sigh> simple for someone to get a bot going which doesn't look completely randm :P
2010-11-28T03:19:24  <Neverstu> ah yes, that's a more concise way to put it

2010-11-28T03:20:08  <burny> woot, I'm tied for first!
2010-11-28T03:20:14  <Neverstu> hot damn
2010-11-28T03:20:58  <Neverstu> i hit top 10 a few days ago, but that was all due to ratings instability for new submissions :/
2010-11-28T03:21:04  <Neverstu> for a few minutes there it was wonderful
2010-11-28T03:21:08  <sigh> :)
2010-11-28T03:21:22  <sigh> where were you before they shut off the games?
2010-11-28T03:21:26  <burny> my highest was 58th or so
2010-11-28T03:21:41  <Neverstu> 42 i believe
2010-11-28T03:21:49  <sigh> cool
2010-11-28T03:22:06  <Neverstu> you?
2010-11-28T03:22:35  <sigh> hmmm... somewhere around 100... I haven't worked on my bot for over a month and my last submission was 2 weeks ago
2010-11-28T03:22:44  <sigh> wish I had had more time

2010-11-28T03:23:22  <Zoo> thats lovely
2010-11-28T03:23:33  <Zoo> I wish spaceinvaders could too =/
2010-11-28T03:23:37  <Neverstu> i had a co-worker to compete with; after he beat me once i became obsessed
2010-11-28T03:24:17  <Neverstu> Zoo: the generator code, or the soupy product?
2010-11-28T03:24:48  <Zoo> the implementation of the genetic part on planet wars
2010-11-28T03:25:03  <Neverstu> that would be neat to see
2010-11-28T03:25:04  <Zoo> Im mostly interested in how they managed to pull it off and make it effective
2010-11-28T03:25:38  <Zoo> yeah it would
2010-11-28T03:25:52  <Zoo> apparently there were a few others who had genetic bots aswell
2010-11-28T03:26:45  <Neverstu> i thought of parameterizing key parts of mine, then evolving those parameters, but it seemed so hopeless to get real data
2010-11-28T03:28:41  <Zoo> Yeah I doubt they got any quick effects either. Im imagining they used clouding and ran it for a month before they managed to get any kind of logic in it
2010-11-28T03:30:20  <antimatroid1> they were in the top 100 right before the end

2010-11-28T03:49:28  <Mistmanov> the "next game will be played within xxxx next games" thingie is disabled for the finals? or it doesn't kick in untill everyone has had a few games?
2010-11-28T03:49:52  <janzert> Mistmanov: it's disabled at least for now
2010-11-28T03:49:56  <Mistmanov> k =)
2010-11-28T03:50:17  <janzert> probably actually it'll stay disabled
2010-11-28T03:50:57  <janzert> since it would be hard to make it work right once we start only playing the top x bots
2010-11-28T03:51:34  <antimatroid1> yeah, i don't see much need for it
2010-11-28T03:52:00  <Neverstu> janzert: speaking of, can you provide more details about how the pairings will work? or should i wait patiently for the inevitable forum discussions? :)
2010-11-28T03:52:23  <janzert> you can look at create_matchups.py in the repo to see exactly how they work :)

2010-11-28T03:52:30  <antimatroid1> in the future there needs to be a "latest games" page
2010-11-28T03:52:51  <Neverstu> janzert: looking now thanks!
2010-11-28T03:52:53  <janzert> it's basically the same as has been though
2010-11-28T03:53:24  <Neverstu> or perhaps the schedule of "pairing cutoffs"?
2010-11-28T03:53:56  <janzert> Neverstu: that is still dependent on how many games we manage to fit into the next few days
2010-11-28T03:54:50  <janzert> I can say it won't start until at least the bottom of the rankings have shook themselves out into the groups we saw before and it will hopefully be gradual
2010-11-28T03:54:53  <antimatroid1> janzert: is it flexible about extending if not enough games have played? or MUST results be released on the first?
2010-11-28T03:55:22  <janzert> antimatroid1: that's up to Jeff but I think we'll probably make it

2010-11-28T04:03:55  <Mistmanov> I really think you could've cut down dramatically on the server load by just removing everyone ranked starter package and below

2010-11-28T04:04:50  <Neverstu> i browsed the bottom of the rankings a few times and was slightly appalled
2010-11-28T04:05:13  <Neverstu> who submits a bot that crashes every single time...and leaves it like that?
2010-11-28T04:05:24  <Mistmanov> someone who doesn't care :p
2010-11-28T04:06:01  <antimatroid1> Neverstu: quite a lot of people made bots that works only for 23 or less planets
2010-11-28T04:06:11  <antimatroid1> so they kind of got crippled with the new map generator
2010-11-28T04:06:24  <Zoo> or left maxdistance at 25
2010-11-28T04:06:26  <Neverstu> antimatroid1: ha! i had forgotten about that
2010-11-28T04:06:39  <Zoo> like me
2010-11-28T04:06:57  <janzert> there are still a lot of bots at the very bottom that have always just crashed immediately on the first turn.
2010-11-28T04:06:57  <antimatroid1> wasn't max distance originally 34?
2010-11-28T04:07:26  <Zoo> People like me dont browse the forums too much hence dont hear about map generator changes until they come on irc and ask about them :)
2010-11-28T04:07:30  <antimatroid1> jaznert: how often do rankings update?
2010-11-28T04:07:47  <antimatroid1> Zoo: you can mostly thank/hate me for that change :)

2010-11-28T04:08:21  <antimatroid1> people seem divided on the thanking/hating part :P
2010-11-28T04:08:42  <Zoo> yeah I imagine its because people dont know their code and cant adapt :P
2010-11-28T04:09:02  <Neverstu> the line-symmetric maps caused a bit of headache, but ultimately my bot was better for it
2010-11-28T04:09:06  <antimatroid1> i think it's made it better, and imo it's boring when people are trying to optimise just for specific maps
2010-11-28T04:09:22  <antimatroid1> it certainly made it tougher
2010-11-28T04:09:52  <antimatroid1> having said that, my bot fails miserably when there are lots of takable planets
2010-11-28T04:10:22  <Zoo> what kind of starting move do you use?
2010-11-28T04:10:32  <antimatroid1> i have my first win under my belt
2010-11-28T04:10:38  <Neverstu> the new generator occasionally spits out extremely sparse maps - i found these to be very illuminating in terms of middle-planet strategy

2010-11-28T04:11:33  <antimatroid1> i basically have 3 steps, 1. cancel out as many of their attacks as i can, 2. use a game tree to pick moves (can't do more than a few moves), 3. redistribute ships closer to the front line

2010-11-28T04:12:48  <antimatroid1> ^^ game tree part handles it

2010-11-28T04:14:11  <antimatroid1> the game tree i entered works as follows, pick moves I would like to make to each planet (sending ships from wherever at any time), then create children, do the same for them at each child, then run minimax, best the best two moves, then extend from that terminal node, rinse and repeat
2010-11-28T04:14:50  <sigh> antimatroid1: what is your eval function>

2010-11-28T04:21:51  <antimatroid1> i assumed we could fight better than them
2010-11-28T04:22:07  <antimatroid1> path filling was easier, and we were quite strong

2010-11-28T05:10:40  <antimatroid1> i have no idea how my bot will do against the other top 200 bots
2010-11-28T05:10:47  <Error323> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1177
2010-11-28T05:10:51  <antimatroid1> it better at least get top 50 :\
2010-11-28T05:11:10  <burny> same here anti.. I only got to see 1 game before final hehe
2010-11-28T05:12:18  <burny> I'm thinking I'm gona be aroudn 100-120 though
2010-11-28T05:12:31  <burny> MAYbe as high as 50-100, but I doubt it
2010-11-28T05:12:51  <antimatroid1> i think my bot is crash free
2010-11-28T05:12:57  <antimatroid1> and i'm pretty sure it shouldn't eve time out
2010-11-28T05:12:58  <Error323> burny: what's ur botname on tcp?
2010-11-28T05:13:07  <burny> it's not on tcp
2010-11-28T05:13:16  <Error323> in the past
2010-11-28T05:13:21  *** krokokru1a is now known as krokokrusa
2010-11-28T05:13:24  <burny> never was
2010-11-28T05:15:13  <antimatroid1> Error323: it's a one week effort
2010-11-28T05:15:18  <antimatroid1> and a pretty decent one
2010-11-28T05:15:31  <Error323> Error323: mmm? what is
2010-11-28T05:15:42  <sigh> heh
2010-11-28T05:15:48  <burny> janz: how hard would it be to make a chart of elo vs time per game(time, rather than turns)
2010-11-28T05:16:12  <sigh> i doubt they recrd that
2010-11-28T05:16:16  <antimatroid1> burnys bot
2010-11-28T05:16:27  <antimatroid1> burny: not going to happen now
2010-11-28T05:16:53  <janzert> burny: yeah, not possible game time length isn't recorded
2010-11-28T05:17:56  <burny> well, time to get to bed
2010-11-28T05:18:27  <burny> as much fun as it is to watch my bot slowly win games, as it drops in the ranks..
2010-11-28T05:20:00  <contestbot> Top 10 players: csr_22(1319), noripcord7(1246), fontanini(1229), arekkap(1227), rastafarra(1227), .mamay.(1225), dustypup(1218), EricManley(1216), b1uespeck(1214), pomppis(1178)
2010-11-28T05:20:00  <janzert> burny: don't worry bocsimacko is down to 2070th ;)
2010-11-28T05:20:46  <burny> 2799 for me, woot!
2010-11-28T05:21:17  <Zoo> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8862368
2010-11-28T05:21:30  <Zoo> how does zheka manage to lose that :|
2010-11-28T05:21:36  <burny> finalyl someone in the top20 that belongs in top20?
2010-11-28T05:21:40  <antimatroid1> dunno but thank fuck :P
2010-11-28T05:21:56  <janzert> what a comeback
2010-11-28T05:22:12  <Zoo> he pretty much just spits on you at the start
2010-11-28T05:22:25  <burny> not so much on.. as beside
2010-11-28T05:22:33  <antimatroid1> i don't want to be coming back yet :(
2010-11-28T05:22:48  <sigh> haha, attacking the top right from the bottm left
2010-11-28T05:22:54  <sigh> that did it
2010-11-28T05:23:21  <sigh> well, just attacking stuff on the opposite side of the board in various places
2010-11-28T05:23:35  <antimatroid1> man, that was a close one to ruining my rank early
2010-11-28T05:23:46  <Zoo> I imagine he adds score based on purely on shipcount
2010-11-28T05:24:43  <burny> I duno.. looks like you dominated that one really
2010-11-28T05:24:51  <antimatroid1> actually, i'm not sure i played that badly there, he made stupid moves the whole time
2010-11-28T05:25:09  <antimatroid1> and i waited to ruin them
2010-11-28T05:25:26  <antimatroid1> it was sort of dangerous, but wasn't terrible
2010-11-28T05:25:29  <burny> could have done a lot better(had hundred+ at base whole game)
2010-11-28T05:25:38  <sigh> he was well ahead on ship count and production
2010-11-28T05:25:43  <Zoo> turn 4 kinda makes it for him
2010-11-28T05:26:14  <sigh> why turn 4?
2010-11-28T05:26:15  <burny> if the opponent made bad moves at the start, just to throw you off, it coulda totally stomed you
2010-11-28T05:26:26  <Zoo> sigh: look where he tries to expand
2010-11-28T05:26:58  <burny> if planet can recoop it's production*2 before the enemy gets to it, it's better to take it, rather than wait for enemy to snipe it
2010-11-28T05:27:09  <Zoo> moves before that allow him to get ahead of antimadroid
2010-11-28T05:27:15  <antimatroid1> i'll be much more comfortable when i'm playing against better ranked bots
2010-11-28T05:27:24  <antimatroid1> it's not got rage bot checks or anything anymore
2010-11-28T05:27:24  <sigh> ll
2010-11-28T05:27:27  <sigh> *lol
2010-11-28T05:27:30  <antimatroid1> although i do try to not make snipable moves
2010-11-28T05:27:56  <antimatroid1> bury: yes, but it's messy to do that when incoming fleets might be arriving before
2010-11-28T05:28:00  <antimatroid1> i couldn't be bothered dealing with all of that
2010-11-28T05:28:07  <burny> there's a 13cost 3grow right beside your base, that you ignored for like 30 turns
2010-11-28T05:28:48  <antimatroid1> if i took that first turn and they did nothing, they'd snipe my 24
2010-11-28T05:28:48  <burny> took enemy 31moves to get to it: it coulda produced 90ships by then
2010-11-28T05:28:53  <antimatroid1> and the 77 5 growth looked bette
2010-11-28T05:29:08  <antimatroid1> then like i've said before, i'm severely capped on the number of actual moves my bot can make each move
2010-11-28T05:29:17  <mega1_> what's iouri's username?
2010-11-28T05:29:17  <antimatroid1> hence i'll be more comfortable once my opponents are better
2010-11-28T05:29:22  <antimatroid1> _iouri
2010-11-28T05:29:42  <antimatroid1> look out for asvaisus or whatever
2010-11-28T05:29:53  <mega1_> thanks
2010-11-28T05:29:56  <antimatroid1> not sure how to actually spell it
2010-11-28T05:30:00  <burny> oh, so if someone just expands like made and then pukes at you, you'll lose for sure?
2010-11-28T05:30:28  <antimatroid1> don't think so?
2010-11-28T05:36:51  <janzert> oops, just realized I was sorting the player order the wrong direction so it wanted to play the player with the most games first instead of last
2010-11-28T05:36:54  <janzert> all fixed now
2010-11-28T05:37:16  <sigh> -_-
2010-11-28T05:37:22  <sigh> :P
2010-11-28T05:37:37  <burny> bocs up to 282 now
2010-11-28T05:37:40  <sigh> so someone has a lot of games?
2010-11-28T05:37:46  <janzert> fortunately I caught it with when they had only gotten 5 games for the leader
2010-11-28T05:38:01  <sigh> ah, that's not too bad
2010-11-28T05:38:25  <janzert> nah, it'll even out again quite quick
2010-11-28T05:38:35  <sigh> burny: link for bocs user profile?
2010-11-28T05:38:46  <burny> wouldn't that have made it so one person would likely have like 5000 games now?
2010-11-28T05:39:05  <janzert> sigh: search for bocs in the user search on the sidebar
2010-11-28T05:39:05  <antimatroid1> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=8565
2010-11-28T05:39:24  <sigh> oh haha, when was that added?
2010-11-28T05:39:37  <janzert> last week?
2010-11-28T05:39:41  <janzert> not too long ago
2010-11-28T05:39:55  <sigh> :)
2010-11-28T05:40:25  <antimatroid1> damn
2010-11-28T05:40:27  <antimatroid1> manwe beat me
2010-11-28T05:41:51  <antimatroid1> i threw the game too
2010-11-28T05:41:53  <antimatroid1> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8863622
2010-11-28T05:41:56  <antimatroid1> stupidest move ever
2010-11-28T05:42:42  <burny> that's an interesting map
2010-11-28T05:42:43  * krokokrusa is running local tournament between his 2 bots, ragebot, error323, and antimatroid :)
2010-11-28T05:42:58  <antimatroid1> let me know the results :)
2010-11-28T05:43:13  <janzert> ouch, it didn't notice all those nasty ships sitting next it?
2010-11-28T05:43:25  <sigh> janzert: I think it decided that planet was a lost cause
2010-11-28T05:43:28  <antimatroid1> janzert: nope, could never get it to do that well
2010-11-28T05:43:47  <antimatroid1> sigh: yeah the game tree would have, but still :(
2010-11-28T05:44:25  <sigh> I remember similar stuff happened when I tried to implement code to abandon planets
2010-11-28T05:44:41  <antimatroid1> my guess is the game tree is sayin, i can take that, they can then take me, they were going to take me if i did nothing, hence doing my move is better
2010-11-28T05:44:59  <sigh> a talking tree!
2010-11-28T05:45:02  <antimatroid1> although it probably wasn't
2010-11-28T05:45:49  <antimatroid1> it's alright, if i'm going to lose to someone, i'd rather it be someone like manwe who is going to be ranked reasonably high
2010-11-28T05:46:00  <sigh> :)
2010-11-28T05:46:35  <janzert> kinda surprised already starting to see some familiar names in the top 100
2010-11-28T05:46:52  <bobng> I see in the source code that you use the command "md5sum" rather than pythons hashlib
2010-11-28T05:46:55  <bobng> is it really faster?
2010-11-28T05:47:18  <bobng> proc = Popen(["md5sum", filename], stdout=PIPE)
2010-11-28T05:47:36  <janzert> bobng: not sure where you're seeing that but I'm pretty certain it wasn't written by me
2010-11-28T05:47:48  <bobng> submission_hash.py
2010-11-28T05:47:51  <janzert> or maybe that was, where is this
2010-11-28T05:47:55  <janzert> yeah it was
2010-11-28T05:47:56  <bobng> # suprisingly in testing this is slower than doing the file hash in python
2010-11-28T05:47:56  <bobng> # this hash value will include the full absolute path to the file
2010-11-28T05:48:08  <bobng> oh wait, wat, its slower?
2010-11-28T05:48:29  <janzert> just sec let me open it and refresh my memory
2010-11-28T05:48:43  <bobng> this has caught my interest. lemme run a test and see
2010-11-28T05:49:32  <janzert> yes, that was slower calling md5sum instead of using the python hash
2010-11-28T05:49:56  <burny> jan, after about 8games, teh top100 list should have most of the correct people
2010-11-28T05:50:02  <janzert> look at def hash_file() and you see I ended up using the internal sha hash
2010-11-28T05:50:30  *** krokokrusa <krokokrusa!~zvold@89.31.118.163> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-11-28T05:50:34  <bobng> oh right, I see now
2010-11-28T05:50:42  <antimatroid1> i don't know about 8 games
2010-11-28T05:50:45  <bobng> were you really surprised?
2010-11-28T05:51:01  <burny> and after 10games, it should resemble the correct order also
2010-11-28T05:51:39  <janzert> burny: that depends on a lot of variable though
2010-11-28T05:51:47  <janzert> bobng: yes, a bit
2010-11-28T05:52:16  *** krokokrusa <krokokrusa!~zvold@89.31.118.163> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-28T05:52:17  <janzert> since I didn't think reading the whole file into python then hashing it would be as fast as md5sum should have been able to do it
2010-11-28T05:52:43  <burny> blah.. I still don't have a 3rd game
2010-11-28T05:52:52  <bobng> it only takes
2010-11-28T05:52:55  <sigh> I have 3 :)
2010-11-28T05:52:56  <Error323> oh i do
2010-11-28T05:52:59  <bobng> 1.1 seconds to hash a 100mb file on my machine
2010-11-28T05:53:01  <Error323> also a win :D
2010-11-28T05:53:09  <Error323> from mister epic fail
2010-11-28T05:53:10  <Error323> :P
2010-11-28T05:53:17  <bobng> Pythons hashlib is actually a C module, so it should be pretty fast
2010-11-28T05:53:24  <burny> pretty sure the pairing, isn't giving a game to the person with least games
2010-11-28T05:53:53  <sigh> janzert said he fixed that
2010-11-28T05:53:55  <Error323> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1177&p=7809#p7809
2010-11-28T05:53:58  <Error323> :)
2010-11-28T05:54:08  <Error323> I updated my post with rank,language etc
2010-11-28T05:55:26  <bobng> heh, I eat my words. Spawning md5sum is faster than doing it in python
2010-11-28T05:55:30  <bobng> by a huge factor.
2010-11-28T05:55:35  <burny> servers all broked?
2010-11-28T05:55:40  <bobng> >>> test_two()
2010-11-28T05:55:40  <bobng> 9b5183f05b62ca114c467945467050be  100mb.test
2010-11-28T05:55:40  <bobng> 0.351421117783
2010-11-28T05:56:06  <bobng> compared to 1.30111789703
2010-11-28T05:56:13  <bobng> when using hashlib.
2010-11-28T05:57:29  <janzert> bobng: hmm, there must be some other factors since I had the reverse
2010-11-28T05:57:58  <bobng> well I was reading 100 bytes at a time and updating the hash object, that might be why.
2010-11-28T05:58:02  <janzert> burny: actually I broke the create_matchup script when adding some logging with my last fix to pairing
2010-11-28T05:58:27  <janzert> bobng: ouch, yeah that's gotta be slowing it down
2010-11-28T05:58:36  <bobng> but in any case it academic. I was doing it on a 100mb file though
2010-11-28T05:58:54  <bobng> perhaps on a smaller file the overhead of starting a md5 process will make it worthless
2010-11-28T05:59:04  <janzert> out of curiosity try my actual hash_file_sha from submission_hash.py
2010-11-28T05:59:29  <janzert> and yeah, this is almost exclusively used on quite small files
2010-11-28T05:59:51  <bobng> sure, give me a sec

2010-11-28T06:11:13  <Error323> ok here's what you can do
2010-11-28T06:11:22  <burny> jan: should save a screenshot of the top100 list at about 8am and 10am(for the 6game and 8game count?).. I'm kinda curious of how accurate my prediction is, on what it'll look like at that point
2010-11-28T06:11:23  <Zoo> Seems like a lot of people are using regular knapsack01 as a starting move :| quite surprising considering they seem to be top 50ish
2010-11-28T06:11:28  <bobng> janzert: my tests show that md5 is faster than sha1
2010-11-28T06:11:31  <Error323> in the makefile remove -DDEBUG
2010-11-28T06:11:34  <Zoo> "alot" being the ones who posted their source
2010-11-28T06:11:34  <burny> do we have a copy of the board before rseting it also?
2010-11-28T06:11:47  <bobng> specifically that
2010-11-28T06:11:47  <bobng> >>> def hash_md5():
2010-11-28T06:11:47  <bobng> ...     f = open("100mb.test")
2010-11-28T06:11:47  <bobng> ...     hash = md5.new()
2010-11-28T06:11:48  <bobng> ...     while True:

2010-11-28T06:11:48  <bobng> ...     return hash.hexdigest()
2010-11-28T06:11:56  <bobng> is faster than a near exact copy of your sha1 hash function
2010-11-28T06:12:09  <bobng> at least with a BUFER_SIZE of under 10,000
2010-11-28T06:13:03  <janzert> need to use similiar buffer sizes to compare fairly of course, but yeah I'm not too surprised
2010-11-28T06:13:47  <bobng> yeah, they both use the same buffer size
2010-11-28T06:14:08  <bobng> and also md5sum seems to be consistently just a bit faster than hashlib
2010-11-28T06:14:14  <bobng> >>> run_func(hash_sha)
2010-11-28T06:14:14  <bobng> 0.461477994919
2010-11-28T06:14:18  <bobng> >>> run_func(hash_md5sum)
2010-11-28T06:14:18  <bobng> 0.355353116989
2010-11-28T06:14:22  <bobng> >>> run_func(hash_md5)
2010-11-28T06:14:22  <bobng> 0.393083095551
2010-11-28T06:14:28  <bobng> so meh.
2010-11-28T06:14:37  <janzert> interesting
2010-11-28T06:14:44  <burny> lols.. http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8862223
2010-11-28T06:14:47  <bobng> not that it makes much difference of course.

2010-11-28T06:15:17  <janzert> oh, you are running each with a cold disk cache right?
2010-11-28T06:15:19  <antimatroid1> just over 4600 bots in the end
2010-11-28T06:15:23  <antimatroid1> quite a nice improvement on tron
2010-11-28T06:15:36  <Error323> antimatroid1: how much did tron have?
2010-11-28T06:15:42  <antimatroid1> like 750 i think
2010-11-28T06:16:07  <antimatroid1> but even here, it's only really competitive in the top 100
2010-11-28T06:16:32  <janzert> bobng: to clear the cache under linux for testing you can use "sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" before each test
2010-11-28T06:16:48  <janzert> as root
2010-11-28T06:16:56  <burny> the top 300ish, seem to all have logic for defending planets
2010-11-28T06:17:17  <burny> and most of those, also logic for avoiding snipable planets
2010-11-28T06:17:32  <janzert> but yeah, it doesn't really make much a difference at this point
2010-11-28T06:18:10  <bobng> sec, lemme clear the cache
2010-11-28T06:18:23  <burny> the last hour had 4400gmes, and I've only had 1 game per hour
2010-11-28T06:18:33  <burny> shouldn't it be an average of nearly 2games per hour?
2010-11-28T06:19:12  <bobng> bah, write error. whatever, it is purely academic
2010-11-28T06:19:25  <janzert> yeah
2010-11-28T06:19:25  <bobng> and i'm just procrastinating
2010-11-28T06:19:29  <janzert> hehe
2010-11-28T06:19:58  <antimatroid1> i'm dreading my next game being a loss

2010-11-28T06:22:42  <bobng> woah, thats a lot of gpm
2010-11-28T06:22:56  <bobng> I remember when it was like 1 game pm
2010-11-28T06:23:10  <burny> so is the average game like, 5seconds or so?
2010-11-28T06:23:16  <krokokrusa> some nice comments in mogron's commit log :) "30e205a no idea what i changed. am now at 617/700 in run_tests5.sh"
2010-11-28T06:23:19  <bobng> with only the web server running.
2010-11-28T06:23:37  <burny> or are multiple games running on each server, with multithreads etc.?
2010-11-28T06:23:40  <bobng> where did all this extra computing power come from?
2010-11-28T06:23:46  <janzert> burny: right around there
2010-11-28T06:24:04  <janzert> 2 simultaneous games per server generally

2010-11-28T06:24:42  <burny> is there memory limits?
2010-11-28T06:24:45  <bobng> oh nice
2010-11-28T06:24:56  <antimatroid1> burny: there are always memory limits
2010-11-28T06:24:58  <bobng> you know you could each get sign up and get one of their free vps's
2010-11-28T06:25:16  <burny> or, what happens if one bot allocates tons of memory, and thrashes it, while it's opponent trys to maximize it's usage of processing time
2010-11-28T06:25:20  <bobng> i don't know how much memory running the engine would take, but they come with like 600mb

2010-11-28T06:25:34  <janzert> it's the cpu that would be more of a problem
2010-11-28T06:25:53  <antimatroid1> yeah, i use the cpu pretty much the whole time
2010-11-28T06:25:54  <janzert> the micro's are allowed to burst but if they stay at high load for a long period they get throttled back
2010-11-28T06:26:01  <burny> if the system has 600meg,s and I allocate a gig of int's, and sort it..
2010-11-28T06:26:01  <antimatroid1> which is only like 0.5 seconds against good bots
2010-11-28T06:26:26  <burny> that'll hurt the performance of the opponent(and the other saps, that happen to be on the same server)
2010-11-28T06:26:50  <Error323> janzert: cool how many servers?
2010-11-28T06:27:03  <janzert> 5 right at the moment
2010-11-28T06:27:20  <janzert> I'll probably kick another one off in a bit
2010-11-28T06:27:54  <janzert> dimkadimon is having a rough go :(
2010-11-28T06:28:18  <bobng> how much $$
2010-11-28T06:28:19  <janzert> anyone remember where he was ranked?
2010-11-28T06:28:20  <bobng> is this costing?
2010-11-28T06:28:38  <burny> I wonder how many of the top50 bots are gona drop a bunch, due to being excessivly tweaked for the test maps
2010-11-28T06:28:42  <janzert> roughly 1.50 per worker per hour
2010-11-28T06:29:21  <mega1_> a draw with asavis
2010-11-28T06:30:20  <antimatroid1> janzert: lower end of the top 100
2010-11-28T06:30:22  <janzert> interesting final moves there by both of you :)
2010-11-28T06:31:11  <mega1_> that was a draw map, I guess
2010-11-28T06:32:29  <antimatroid1> dimka is having a rough time
2010-11-28T06:32:30  <burny> bocs would have lost, if asavis made an attack just hoping for the best
2010-11-28T06:32:38  <antimatroid1> he is my unofficial rival, but damn that's rough aha
2010-11-28T06:33:38  <antimatroid1> it is a pretty bad map
2010-11-28T06:33:52  <burny> oh actually nm, even if he lost the planet in the final turn: wouldn't have lost any growth right?
2010-11-28T06:34:03  <antimatroid1> at least it was a draw with another top ranked bot
2010-11-28T06:34:18  <medrimonia> mega_1: I think it's a draw map too
2010-11-28T06:34:44  <burny> pretty sure my bot would lose on that map
2010-11-28T06:35:03  <burny> cause once population was up to about 200, it'd want to attack something

2010-11-28T06:37:11  <antimatroid1> s still nowhere near that
2010-11-28T06:37:26  <medrimonia> I think we'll have to wait at least 20 games before having most of the right people in top 100

2010-11-28T06:55:00  <Zoo> same here
2010-11-28T06:55:01  <antimatroid1> i don't use knapsack at all
2010-11-28T06:55:02  <sigh> what is multiturn knapsak?
2010-11-28T06:55:07  <Zoo> well, not first turn but first expansion
2010-11-28T06:55:11  <Error323> and skip planets that are in the center for capturing so i can snipe them off
2010-11-28T06:55:15  <antimatroid1> optimise for n turns in the future?
2010-11-28T06:55:20  <Zoo> and im not sure if it can be called knapsack anymore
2010-11-28T06:55:22  <Zoo> antimatroid1: yeah
2010-11-28T06:55:30  <sigh> i see
2010-11-28T06:55:37  <Zoo> most profit in n turns
2010-11-28T06:55:41  <antimatroid1> i tried dynamic programming for optimal ships to send for given feasible amounts
2010-11-28T06:55:44  <antimatroid1> but it was REALLY slow
2010-11-28T06:55:52  <antimatroid1> no way it would work for move selection in a game tree
2010-11-28T06:56:01  <burny> looks like roughly 30% of the original top100 are in the top100 now.. and about 50% of the top100, were in the top200
2010-11-28T06:56:34  <Error323> my version of knapsack uses dynamic programming
2010-11-28T06:56:42  <antimatroid1> knapsack is dp :P

2010-11-28T07:14:02  <Muffi> 2nd question. If that contest starts again some day, will it be the same game? Is it worth to keep the code?
2010-11-28T07:14:19  <antimatroid1> it'll be another game
2010-11-28T07:14:23  <Muffi> ok
2010-11-28T07:14:25  <antimatroid1> the last game was tron
2010-11-28T07:14:35  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't just delete the code though
2010-11-28T07:15:16  <CACA> please tell me is it possible somewhow to upload corrected code - i made stupid division by zero, and now there is 3 crashes (but ship count is on my side :-(
2010-11-28T07:15:22  <CACA> please
2010-11-28T07:15:23  <CACA> plase
2010-11-28T07:15:26  <Muffi> hihi
2010-11-28T07:15:30  <Muffi> i asked the same
2010-11-28T07:15:45  <Muffi> no

2010-11-28T07:15:47  <antimatroid1> ouch
2010-11-28T07:16:21  <antimatroid1> that would have hurt bocsi temporarily too
2010-11-28T07:16:26  <CACA> admins, pleaseeeeeeeeee

2010-11-28T07:16:58  <Muffi> but hey, a off by one when to capture a planet and anyhow rank 482
2010-11-28T07:17:10  <Muffi> could be worse ;-)
2010-11-28T07:17:18  <janzert> CACA: Sorry the deadline is well and truely past
2010-11-28T07:17:31  <antimatroid1> Muffi: i got disqualified from tron for timing out on a single game, i expect to finish top 10 :(
2010-11-28T07:17:32  <burny> lol anti.. wtf was that?
2010-11-28T07:17:43  <janzert> some poor person that was the second to last submission had there submission fail to compile :(
2010-11-28T07:17:58  <antimatroid1> burny: ?
2010-11-28T07:18:00  <CACA> but admins can change rank counting rulesss.
2010-11-28T07:18:03  <CACA> for example
2010-11-28T07:18:12  <CACA> if there is division by zero
2010-11-28T07:18:12  <antimatroid1> rank counting rules?
2010-11-28T07:18:14  <burny> asavis just randomly decided to give the game away?
2010-11-28T07:18:17  <krokokrusa> janzert: to compile _in time_, I believe
2010-11-28T07:18:28  <CACA> just ignore it- count ships BEFORE crash ??
2010-11-28T07:18:43  <Muffi> but you can cry seeing all the time sending ships that ends with 0 units for the enemy *cry*
2010-11-28T07:18:46  <janzert> krokokrusa: ? no it had a compilation error
2010-11-28T07:18:55  <burny> so teh best strat is to not attack anything.. and once opponent takes something, to crash?
2010-11-28T07:18:57  <janzert> undefined variable if I remember right
2010-11-28T07:19:20  <Zoo> I figure it might be a good idea to get some sponsors for the next competition

2010-11-28T07:24:01  <antimatroid1> that's not a bad start
2010-11-28T07:24:07  <smloh1> is the pairing right now purely random? or rank-based?
2010-11-28T07:24:13  <antimatroid1> i'm less nervous now
2010-11-28T07:24:19  <antimatroid1> rank based i think
2010-11-28T07:24:44  <antimatroid1> which is why i'm less nervous now
2010-11-28T07:25:03  <antimatroid1> i think i've done a sufficient amount to get to play the better bots soon enough
2010-11-28T07:25:10  <janzert> smloh1: still rank based, but that is basically random
2010-11-28T07:25:20  <janzert> the first games were of course purely random
2010-11-28T07:25:29  <antimatroid1> it's risky business having more games against bad bots for this

2010-11-28T07:26:46  <Error323> well I know my bot is better
2010-11-28T07:26:47  <antimatroid1> yeah, but if you lose early, then you probably have to play more bad bots
2010-11-28T07:26:51  <Error323> so thats good
2010-11-28T07:26:54  <antimatroid1> so you have a higher chance of losing more games to them
2010-11-28T07:26:56  <CACA> @admins: could you change rank rules - to ignore crashes for All players and count ships until crash ?
2010-11-28T07:26:57  <contestbot> CACA: User error -- Replace user.
2010-11-28T07:26:59  <antimatroid1> which would really hurt in the long run i think
2010-11-28T07:27:34  <Error323> CACA: of course not, that would mean i'd crash my bot as soon as my shipcount is higher

2010-11-28T07:28:13  <janzert> it is lost when your gun jams or engine on your plane quits though
2010-11-28T07:28:56  <krokokrusa> I propose drop everyone's scores when somebody divides by zero

2010-11-28T07:30:16  <antimatroid1> i'd allow that argument
2010-11-28T07:30:22  <Error323> xD
2010-11-28T07:30:22  <antimatroid1> just for its absurdity :P

2010-11-28T07:31:14  <burny> that's gota be an upseting loss

2010-11-28T07:33:33  <sigh> heh, your bot is fun to watch
2010-11-28T07:33:38  <burny> caca.. how about this?  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8870418
2010-11-28T07:33:48  <antimatroid1> CACA: last contest i was disqualified for timing out, at least that hasn't happened
2010-11-28T07:34:08  <Error323> janzert: will drawmaps be removed at some point?
2010-11-28T07:34:39  <antimatroid1> before i didn't think it'd be needed, but some of those maps before were pretty awful
2010-11-28T07:34:50  <janzert> Error323: probably not, if some map is getting larger than 50% draws I could probably talked into it though
2010-11-28T07:35:14  <Error323> yeah ok
2010-11-28T07:35:20  <Error323> that'll never happen though :P
2010-11-28T07:35:23  <antimatroid1> although, i think it's possible alright to test some bots on draw maps, and a lot of people will fail on them anyway
2010-11-28T07:35:30  <antimatroid1> i don't trust my bot on a draw map at all, but we'll see
2010-11-28T07:35:34  <Error323> or well... it might but is highly unlikely
2010-11-28T07:35:40  <janzert> top draw percentage is 14% right now so :)
2010-11-28T07:36:06  <janzert> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8873696
2010-11-28T07:36:10  <janzert> that map
2010-11-28T07:36:34  <Zoo> CACA's bot is beautiful :)
2010-11-28T07:36:44  <antimatroid1> ahhh, yeah i would probably draw with people on that
2010-11-28T07:36:45  <Zoo> like blooming roses
2010-11-28T07:36:49  <antimatroid1> that centre planet is very appealing

2010-11-28T07:41:10  <antimatroid1> hence my worry about the start of the contest

2010-11-28T07:41:27  <antimatroid1> yeah, mine is a brand new tree i came up with today

2010-11-28T07:43:08  <Error323> well however it turns out, I have to say it was awesome and I wanna thank the devs a lot for that! Very nice work!
2010-11-28T07:43:22  <antimatroid1> with an hour left i uploaded this new one, then decided no, uploaded my old one with 30 minutes left, then that lost its first game to someone in the 200's and i was like ah crap now what, then with 11 minutes left i resubmitted my new bot
2010-11-28T07:43:43  <Error323> antimatroid1: that's very dangerous based on one loss
2010-11-28T07:43:48  <antimatroid1> yeah, janzert thanks heaps, i'm not sure what it would be like atm without you
2010-11-28T07:43:53  <janzert> antimatroid1: hehe, what a tossup

2010-11-28T07:44:53  <antimatroid1> i think this new one could be better if i had thought of it earlier, but oh well
2010-11-28T07:45:47  <burny> k, right now is when I think most of the top100 peeps, should be in the top100
2010-11-28T07:45:56  <CACA> in any case- AI comp is VERY fun, i wish same ai comp spirit for next year !!!!
2010-11-28T07:46:18  <Error323> burny: i'm still not in it >_<

2010-11-28T07:46:20  <CACA> good job devs

2010-11-28T07:47:51  <heikoh> I enjoyed this challenge as well. Unfortunately didn't hear about it untill last Wednesday, so didn't have much time to come up with something good. Will be on the lookout for the next challenge and step in a lot earlier!

2010-11-28T07:50:24  <smloh1> ahh, got my first loss vs JimRogerz
2010-11-28T07:51:04  <burny> why are so many yop10 bots losing against sub 100s?
2010-11-28T07:51:21  <burny> too much fine tuning against strictly top100's, ad on specific maps?
2010-11-28T07:51:31  <antimatroid1> Error323: just above 100 i think
2010-11-28T07:51:32  <Error323> burny: possibly
2010-11-28T07:51:40  <antimatroid1> burny: exactly that
2010-11-28T07:51:43  <janzert> looks like the crash bots are just about sorted out to the bottom anyway
2010-11-28T07:52:02  <Error323> janzert: rip them out :)
2010-11-28T07:52:04  <antimatroid1> janzert: people are having a lot of trouble with lower ranked bots
2010-11-28T07:52:11  <antimatroid1> i think a lot of people haven't played them in a while
2010-11-28T07:52:19  <janzert> yeah, I've noticed
2010-11-28T07:52:30  <antimatroid1> i don't have a problem with it, just a comment :)
2010-11-28T07:52:35  <Error323> trapped in local optima
2010-11-28T07:52:38  <antimatroid1> ranking is one very tough business
2010-11-28T07:52:41  <burny> I think if people lose against weaker bots.. that should be a reasonable component of their score.. just like losing on a tie map
2010-11-28T07:52:53  <antimatroid1> burny: agreed
2010-11-28T07:52:56  <Error323> ofc it is
2010-11-28T07:53:09  <burny> if you assume your opponent doesn't suck.. it allows you to make more powerful moves
2010-11-28T07:53:36  <antimatroid1> unfortunately i think it confirms my point about the order in which you win games is not independent of your final ranking, but i can't think of a better ranking method
2010-11-28T07:54:08  <janzert> part of the problem is during the open contest the resubmissions have to play near ranked bots to validate they deserve the rank but it means everyone nearby never plays bots further away
2010-11-28T07:54:25  <Mistmanov> everyone playing against everyone on every map.. but that's a lot of games -_-
2010-11-28T07:54:32  <antimatroid1> yeah, i think in the future it would be good if elos were completely reset for each resubmission?
2010-11-28T07:54:35  <Error323> janzert: yeah thats exactly the problem ppl were having
2010-11-28T07:54:35  <janzert> I think next contest the resubmission needs to be paired somewhere between where the old submission was and the middle of the rankings
2010-11-28T07:54:49  <Error323> i think they should always start in the middle
2010-11-28T07:55:02  <antimatroid1> and a lot of people can game the current system beofre the actual contest
2010-11-28T07:55:03  <Error323> centeroid of the ranking
2010-11-28T07:55:12  <Error323> like it was at the start
2010-11-28T07:55:13  <janzert> well that's the way it used to be and we heard endless griping about it :P
2010-11-28T07:55:21  <Error323> not by me ^_^
2010-11-28T07:55:23  <antimatroid1> which is fine by me, they only let themselves down when they finish lower than they got their hopes up for
2010-11-28T07:55:25  <Error323> but ye i understand

2010-11-28T07:56:00  <antimatroid1> yeah, not complaining, i just like to rip things to pieces analytically if you will
2010-11-28T07:56:22  <janzert> yep, yep.
2010-11-28T07:56:51  <janzert> I do think there is probably a fairly happy middle ground between always start in the middle and start where you were
2010-11-28T07:57:08  <antimatroid1> what if all bots started in the middle?
2010-11-28T07:57:09  <burny> if there's a sufficient number of games: the top bots having a few losses to the crap-bots, won't make much difference
2010-11-28T07:57:12  <antimatroid1> rahter than the bottom
2010-11-28T07:57:26  <antimatroid1> burny: the problem is how many games can we run in 5 days
2010-11-28T07:57:36  <janzert> I did debate about suggesting to some of the top people in the last week to submit crash bots for a bit
2010-11-28T07:57:37  <Error323> yeah 5 days isn't a lot
2010-11-28T07:57:40  <antimatroid1> and if you have those 2-3 losses and your equivalent other bot doesn't, you lose
2010-11-28T07:58:15  <Error323> why is it 5 days btw
2010-11-28T07:58:17  <janzert> so they could see how they were going to do climbing back up but decided that could be seen as unfair help
2010-11-28T07:58:21  <Error323> that's scary little time
2010-11-28T07:58:33  <Error323> i'd say a month would be much better :>
2010-11-28T07:58:47  <antimatroid1> i feel bad for you, i don't have to worry about being impartial much
2010-11-28T07:58:53  <janzert> Error323: there'd be no one left to hear the result by then ;)
2010-11-28T07:58:58  <smloh1> yes, a month should be enough time to run everyone against everyone on every map
2010-11-28T07:59:10  <antimatroid1> i'd stick around to watch for a month
2010-11-28T07:59:15  <antimatroid1> after spending 3 months programming
2010-11-28T07:59:41  <antimatroid1> i still don't understand the nonlive leaderboard concept even being considered, it's like only broadcasting the results of sports matches at the end
2010-11-28T07:59:48  <burny> at current rate, 5days is about 300games per bot

2010-11-28T08:01:08  <burny> if we punt everyone who is at or below the rank of the default bot, after 48hours, that should get the 'real' bots, like 500games each?

2010-11-28T08:02:46  <antimatroid1> but i think watching the leaderboard for 5 days will keep me entertained
2010-11-28T08:02:58  <smloh1> ah but crash bot games run in way faster than 100 games per minute
2010-11-28T08:03:10  <antimatroid1> lol, and slow bots take more than a minute per game
2010-11-28T08:03:19  <Error323> smloh1: yes, but 200 turn games way slower
2010-11-28T08:03:29  <smloh1> that's true, 200 seconds max
2010-11-28T08:03:30  <asdfghv> on the subject of bayeselo, you guys might have been interested in the kaggle challenge to make a Better Elo
2010-11-28T08:03:34  <Error323> 100 gpm is already quite an optimistic average
2010-11-28T08:04:06  <antimatroid1> what about completely random pairings for 2 days, then implementing the better pairing algorithm
2010-11-28T08:04:14  <antimatroid1> so people could sort out their positions roughly, then let it rip
2010-11-28T08:04:22  <antimatroid1> not for this contest, but for the future
2010-11-28T08:05:21  <Error323> or weight losing against a much weaker opponent with the inverse probability of facing the weak opponent.
2010-11-28T08:06:32  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.80.211> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2010-11-28T08:07:12  <Mistmanov> it's a bit random whether you lose from weak opponents though. It's like my latest bot destroys my earliest attempts 95 out of 100 games.. but in 5 games the map just favors the coding of the earlier
2010-11-28T08:07:16  <burny> roughly 30hours, lets all bots face all toher bots once, on a random map
2010-11-28T08:07:34  <Mistmanov> if you then have the bad luck to play on that crappy map, and the loss is weighted very heavily
2010-11-28T08:07:35  <Mistmanov> ..
2010-11-28T08:07:45  <antimatroid1> you want to run more than a couple of maps
2010-11-28T08:07:57  <burny> anti: ideally.. obviously..
2010-11-28T08:08:20  <burny> but 1map against EVERY person, is a fairly good average
2010-11-28T08:08:26  <Error323> yeah its too biased probably
2010-11-28T08:08:26  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-28T08:08:37  <burny> not 1 specific map.. random one for each pairing
2010-11-28T08:08:53  <antimatroid1> i think it will work reasonably well now

2010-11-28T08:09:43  <burny> I personally think that it should have been more of a balance though, between win %, and elo

2010-11-28T08:11:41  <janzert> the whole open contest we only played around 4.7 million games
2010-11-28T08:12:03  <burny> oh, meh.. ya.. I was off by a factor of 60 lol
2010-11-28T08:12:08  <asdfghv> games vs similarly rated opponents are more informative -- it teaches us nothing new to pair bocsimacko vs bot#1000
2010-11-28T08:12:19  <Error323> ((4600 * (4600-1))/2) / (100 * 60 * 24) = 73 days of continuous play
2010-11-28T08:12:32  <burny> asdf.. it does when bosc loses to bot #1000 :P
2010-11-28T08:13:21  <asdfghv> sure. but if bot#1000 can beat bosci then surely it can also beat #900-#999 quite easily
2010-11-28T08:13:30  <janzert> ideally we would like to pair the biggest potential upsets :)
2010-11-28T08:13:38  <Error323> hehe yeah
2010-11-28T08:13:52  <Error323> just make bocsimacko face everyone on each map :P
2010-11-28T08:13:58  <burny> asdf.. :  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8870418
2010-11-28T08:14:45  <asdfghv> an upset for sure but he's 135th
2010-11-28T08:14:49  <Error323> was asavis that good unofficial?

2010-11-28T08:14:56  <burny> was 1st
2010-11-28T08:15:07  <Error323> or is everyone just drewling on its loss because it drawed against bocsimacko

2010-11-28T08:15:18  <GreenTea> OMG asavis..
2010-11-28T08:15:21  <antimatroid1> it was in the top 5, and finished sitting first
2010-11-28T08:15:33  <medrimonia> yes asavis is doing quite badly
2010-11-28T08:16:02  <Error323> well
2010-11-28T08:16:14  <antimatroid1> my bot is holding strongish for the moment
2010-11-28T08:16:20  <GreenTea> last commit of asavis was Nov 27th 19:29:54
2010-11-28T08:16:23  <antimatroid1> but hasn't really had a challenging person except manwe who it lost to
2010-11-28T08:16:36  <Error323> its a number game, you can beat a much weaker opponent 95% of the time but if this game you face a map of the 5% u'll drop like a brick right now
2010-11-28T08:16:42  <GreenTea> this is 3:29 by Kyiv timezone

2010-11-28T08:17:33  <antimatroid1> Erro323: rankings are still completely out of whack
2010-11-28T08:17:41  <Error323> true
2010-11-28T08:17:59  <antimatroid1> i want my bot to go into the top 100 already
2010-11-28T08:18:07  <antimatroid1> i'm sicking of risky games against lower ranked bots
2010-11-28T08:18:27  <medrimonia> It's really funny how this is completely random now
2010-11-28T08:18:30  <antimatroid1> i almost lost one

2010-11-28T08:19:04  <medrimonia> smloh1: jimrogerz is quite good but uwetudd was #277
2010-11-28T08:19:15  <smloh1> will we just freeze the lowest bots?
2010-11-28T08:19:36  <smloh1> medrimonia: ah, curses on my unreliable reinforcement algorithm!
2010-11-28T08:19:37  <antimatroid1> smloh1: yep

2010-11-28T08:20:07  <smloh1> when that happens how about the matches with them?
2010-11-28T08:20:25  <Error323> btw guys, publish your code please: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1177
2010-11-28T08:20:29  <medrimonia> The more interessant is that we will know how will the good bots racts against those who aren't ranked in top 100
2010-11-28T08:20:32  <burny> was around 50% of bots, the default?
2010-11-28T08:20:47  <antimatroid1> smloh1: i expect the matches are kept
2010-11-28T08:20:55  <antimatroid1> i'll be very disappointed if they aren't
2010-11-28T08:21:18  <medrimonia> Hmmm Error323: I think my code is really unreadable
2010-11-28T08:21:31  <Error323> medrimonia: doesn't matter
2010-11-28T08:21:40  <burny> it seems to me that roughly 80% of bots can be purged after 24hours
2010-11-28T08:21:56  <Error323> reading other people's code is the _best_ way to learn programming
2010-11-28T08:21:58  <antimatroid1> my code isn't very readable

2010-11-28T08:24:25  <Accoun> all 75 map sets sepecial and give special winer
2010-11-28T08:24:29  <Accoun> explain in detail:
2010-11-28T08:24:38  <Accoun> 75 map set fast give wrong winer (map set related)
2010-11-28T08:24:38  <Accoun> 999 map set give true winer if enougth number of games played, more games more accurate result
2010-11-28T08:24:47  <asdfghv> why 999 though, and not 9999?
2010-11-28T08:24:56  <burny> it's over 9000!

2010-11-28T08:25:47  <GreenTea> Who know how many maps are used? 75?
2010-11-28T08:25:53  <asdfghv> protocolon was 31st before
2010-11-28T08:25:57  <Accoun> only 75
2010-11-28T08:25:58  <antimatroid1> yes 75 maps are in the set
2010-11-28T08:26:02  <GreenTea> oO
2010-11-28T08:26:03  <antimatroid1> they are available in the forums
2010-11-28T08:26:13  <antimatroid1> they were all generated fresh for the tournament
2010-11-28T08:26:20  <Accoun> it canadin chiters
2010-11-28T08:26:22  <GreenTea> This is sad..
2010-11-28T08:26:27  <antimatroid1> what is sad?
2010-11-28T08:26:36  <antimatroid1> they're 75 random maps
2010-11-28T08:26:52  <asdfghv> hmm the pairing algorithm, was it based on elo score or on nearness in ranking?
2010-11-28T08:27:07  <GreenTea> I agree with Accoun

2010-11-28T08:27:42  <antimatroid1> asdfghv: something to do with pareto distribution to nearest elo or something

2010-11-28T08:28:03  <medrimonia> Accoun need to review the meaning of "cheating"

2010-11-28T08:32:45  <Error323> ...
2010-11-28T08:32:46  <burny> no any reason for use more maps
2010-11-28T08:32:52  <antimatroid1> Accoun: argue/discuss better methods for ranking if you want, hell we do it here all the time, but at the end of the day, the contest is still fair (which is most important) and the organisers put a lot of effort in, which they do at their own expense

2010-11-28T08:33:26  <Error323> Accoun: nonsense, its a random distribution over maptypes from the generator.
2010-11-28T08:33:30  <Accoun> okey?
2010-11-28T08:33:30  <antimatroid1> is accoun a bot?
2010-11-28T08:33:54  <burny> accoun: NO one knows ahead of time which 'special' map types will happen though
2010-11-28T08:34:04  <burny> and, bots are SUPOSED to be good at ALL map types
2010-11-28T08:34:08  <Accoun> no any reson use only 75 maps except for chiting
2010-11-28T08:34:16  <Error323> 1000 maps or 75 maps just gives lower amount of types of maps. But the same percentages roughly

2010-11-28T08:34:53  <antimatroid1> Accoun: it's not going to change, so get over it
2010-11-28T08:34:55  <Accoun> easy ajusted to mekre selected winer
2010-11-28T08:35:05  <Accoun> easy ajusted to make selected winer
2010-11-28T08:35:09  <antimatroid1> nobody is selecting any winners
2010-11-28T08:35:33  <burny> it'd be hilareous if the default ai wins :P

2010-11-28T08:36:13  <Error323> well if that's the case, the ranking algo should be revised :P
2010-11-28T08:36:19  <Accoun> no any reson use only 75 maps except for chiting

2010-11-28T08:36:37  <Error323> Accoun: stop repeating urself -.-
2010-11-28T08:36:45  <medrimonia> Accoun said the other day that if he had one "mouth" more, he would win against bocsimacko, because he's a better player than him
2010-11-28T08:36:48  <antimatroid1> janzert: i don't know about that, the game specifics are different, did he get those right?
2010-11-28T08:36:54  <Error323> janzert: cool
2010-11-28T08:37:03  <Error323> good to know we're kicking its ass :P
2010-11-28T08:37:04  <burny> I do have to agree though.. that there's no advantage to using 75maps rather than a few hundred maps
2010-11-28T08:37:07  <janzert> antimatroid1: I don't really know any specifics on it
2010-11-28T08:37:21  <Accoun> all 75 map sets sepecial and give special winer
2010-11-28T08:37:28  <burny> but, I also think 75maps is sufficient
2010-11-28T08:37:30  <Accoun> all 999 map sets identical and give the same winer
2010-11-28T08:37:36  <janzert> antimatroid1: just that the galcon author submitted it as the actual galcon bot
2010-11-28T08:37:38  <Accoun> explain in detail:
2010-11-28T08:37:42  <antimatroid1> he's had just as long as bocsimacko, if he was a better player he'd already be beating him
2010-11-28T08:37:45  <Accoun> 75 map set fast give wrong winer (map set related)
2010-11-28T08:37:54  <janzert> Accoun you already posted that within the last 15 minutes
2010-11-28T08:37:57  <Error323> Accoun: unless you can explain why with good arguments in proper english stop repeating, because I can't understand you...
2010-11-28T08:37:59  <Accoun> 999 map set give true winer if enougth number of games played, more games more accurate result
2010-11-28T08:38:24  <antimatroid1> Accoun: the problem is the number of games that can feasibly be played
2010-11-28T08:38:32  <antimatroid1> but we've been over this, i can't be bothered doing it again
2010-11-28T08:38:46  <smloh1> no matter what, there is always going to be a map set bias
2010-11-28T08:38:46  <Error323> its like talking to a brick wall
2010-11-28T08:38:46  <GreenTea> Accoun let me ask you one question
2010-11-28T08:39:05  <Accoun> no any reson use only 75 maps except for chiting
2010-11-28T08:39:07  <asdfghv> Accoun : you are suggesting that by sampling 75 maps with rejection from the map distribution, the outcome can be skewed. However the same argument applies regardless of the number of maps you choose.
2010-11-28T08:39:09  <antimatroid1> medrimonia: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8869599 i'm glad you agreed that it's a draw map
2010-11-28T08:39:10  <GreenTea> This guy in you profile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-5nXqUF29Q,  this is you?
2010-11-28T08:39:12  <burny> error, if 999maps has 37 'draw maps'... 75maps will most likely have either 8% more or 28% less
2010-11-28T08:39:44  <Error323> 999 maps will have many more draw maps
2010-11-28T08:40:00  <Error323> 75 maps already have quite some draw maps
2010-11-28T08:40:09  <burny> I just raed  ahat.. and picked some numbers
2010-11-28T08:40:10  <Accoun> u a realy so stuped or it sumulation?
2010-11-28T08:40:11  <Error323> however you define draw anyway
2010-11-28T08:40:19  <medrimonia> antimatroid1: Yep, it's sad, but if someone makes an error, he'll loose
2010-11-28T08:40:29  <burny> error, for any definable 'type' of map..
2010-11-28T08:40:51  <burny> a smaller set of maps, will have a less 'average' representation OF that type, vs a larger set
2010-11-28T08:41:08  <Accoun> actualy any top bot make luse any ozer top bot on same map
2010-11-28T08:41:09  <medrimonia> But antimatroid1: I think that it's normal that there's some draw maps, just to see if the people know how to deal with this cases.
2010-11-28T08:41:22  <antimatroid1> medrimonia: i agree
2010-11-28T08:41:39  <antimatroid1> and lower ranked bots wont all handle it, is it reasonable to let them assume such maps don't exist
2010-11-28T08:41:40  <Error323> burny: it will be less accurate yes
2010-11-28T08:41:45  <janzert> woah, two losses for bocsi
2010-11-28T08:41:49  <antimatroid1> shit
2010-11-28T08:41:50  <smloh1> really??
2010-11-28T08:42:04  <Error323> holy shit
2010-11-28T08:42:05  <Accoun> actualy any top bot make luse to any ozer top bot on same map- by selection map set can make any winer
2010-11-28T08:42:05  <antimatroid1> it's all over the show :\
2010-11-28T08:42:09  <Accoun> no any reson use only 75 maps except for chiting
2010-11-28T08:42:11  <medrimonia> whoot, strange really!
2010-11-28T08:42:25  <smloh1> that's strange, those are top 100 bots aren't they?
2010-11-28T08:42:30  <burny> error. ya.. it really doesn't matter though, since we were given the generator.. and the ai needs to be good on all types
2010-11-28T08:42:39  <smloh1> in fact i thought protocolon was top 10 for a good while
2010-11-28T08:42:46  <Accoun> in fact actualy any top bot make luse to any ozer top bot on same map- by selection map set can make any winer
2010-11-28T08:42:49  <GreenTea> <Accoun> no any reson use only 75 maps except for chiting. yea yea. we know)))
2010-11-28T08:42:51  <antimatroid1> smloh1: did you just ask who bocsimacko is?
2010-11-28T08:43:00  <burny> it'd be a bit different if you weren't given the entire map info(and had to explore).. or weren't given the generator
2010-11-28T08:43:00  <smloh1> no i mean the ones he lost to
2010-11-28T08:43:36  <antimatroid1> i don't like having a definitive map generator right from the start
2010-11-28T08:43:37  <smloh1> i thought he might have lost if he'd overfitted for top-performing bots, but these are by no means lower than 100-ranked
2010-11-28T08:43:40  <Accoun> canadin chiting
2010-11-28T08:43:49  <antimatroid1> it isn't always clear what maps will work best till people have toyed with the problem
2010-11-28T08:43:50  <Error323> I don't recall kevlar being that good?
2010-11-28T08:44:03  <smloh1> maybe i'm just remembering from earlier in the competition
2010-11-28T08:44:06  <antimatroid1> yeah, i've never seen kevlar
2010-11-28T08:44:15  <antimatroid1> photocolon is ranked highly
2010-11-28T08:44:25  <antimatroid1> colocon* TIL
2010-11-28T08:44:25  <burny> was 68th with 12games before final
2010-11-28T08:44:27  <medrimonia> kavlar was #68
2010-11-28T08:44:33  <medrimonia> kevlar*
2010-11-28T08:44:34  <Error323> ah ok
2010-11-28T08:44:38  <Error323> thats not bad
2010-11-28T08:44:38  <antimatroid1> rankings at the end were retarded
2010-11-28T08:44:43  <Error323> true
2010-11-28T08:44:44  <antimatroid1> i was 41st
2010-11-28T08:44:48  <Error323> i was 200th
2010-11-28T08:44:50  <Error323> :P
2010-11-28T08:44:51  <antimatroid1> and i hadn't been on the site in like a month
2010-11-28T08:44:53  <burny> also.. a single loss, is to be expected
2010-11-28T08:44:55  <Error323> which is retarded ofc :P
2010-11-28T08:45:17  <burny> if the same(or all) crappy bots, beat the same top bots often.. then that's different
2010-11-28T08:45:31  <Accoun> actualy any top bot make luse to any ozer top bot on same map- by selection map set can make any winer
2010-11-28T08:45:37  <burny> but it's expected that a 1500elo will beat a 2500elo like 1 in 1000 games
2010-11-28T08:45:46  <antimatroid1> if bocsi doesn't win i hope shangas does
2010-11-28T08:45:51  <antimatroid1> cause the bot is almost a month old
2010-11-28T08:46:29  <Error323> I hope a bot with evolutionary programming or any other type of non-heuristic stuff wins
2010-11-28T08:46:51  <antimatroid1> does my game tree count? :P
2010-11-28T08:47:03  <Zoo> spaceinvaders was at 300 last I checked
2010-11-28T08:47:09  <antimatroid1> yeah he was doing badly
2010-11-28T08:47:13  <burny> ouch.. I just beat a rank47

2010-11-28T08:52:28  <Error323> wth
2010-11-28T08:52:29  <protocolocon> yep, just possitional luck
2010-11-28T08:52:46  <Zoo> I wonder if this contest will one day be eligible to be added in ones CV :P
2010-11-28T08:53:00  <antimatroid1> Zoo: mega1 put in his 11th from tron
2010-11-28T08:53:09  <antimatroid1> i would
2010-11-28T08:53:12  <protocolocon> it is already, you can see bocsimacko CV in the web

2010-11-28T08:53:37  <Zoo> so even getting in to final 10% is a feat worth mentioning
2010-11-28T08:53:47  <Zoo> getting in top 2% is something to be very proud of
2010-11-28T08:53:56  <Zoo> and winning...thats something entirely different
2010-11-28T08:54:01  <antimatroid1> it makes me sad to talk about finishing well
2010-11-28T08:54:15  <protocolocon> antimatroid1: yep, one needs to know who is winning you
2010-11-28T08:54:15  <antimatroid1> i so badly wanted top 10 in tron and i didn't even get to finish due to a stupid timeout
2010-11-28T08:54:39  <burny> getting into top500 isn't too hard.. and top 1000 is nearly trivial
2010-11-28T08:54:39  <antimatroid1> of course
2010-11-28T08:54:49  <antimatroid1> top 1000 is trivial

2010-11-28T08:55:38  <Mistmanov> I don't know for sure, but I think that top ~200 doesn't really require a lot of programming genius, just a lot of free time
2010-11-28T08:55:42  <GreenTea> 144  gpm - not bad, not bad..
2010-11-28T08:55:59  <Mistmanov> (if you have programming genius and little free time, you can ofcourse also get top 200 =))
2010-11-28T08:55:59  <burny> agree
2010-11-28T08:56:11  <insectores> Mistmanov, you hit the spot.
2010-11-28T08:56:17  <Error323> yup
2010-11-28T08:56:26  <insectores> I didn't had enough spare time, so I'll not even reach top 1000.
2010-11-28T08:56:27  <Zoo> there were thousands of people with free time, yet only 200 make it to top 200
2010-11-28T08:56:31  <Zoo> :)
2010-11-28T08:56:37  <burny> a few days before final, it was around rank 300. where it started to require more then 10mnutes of work
2010-11-28T08:56:39  <Mistmanov> thousands of people who didn't care enough :p
2010-11-28T08:56:48  <Error323> well wouldn't say that
2010-11-28T08:56:50  <Zoo> or just werent skilled enough
2010-11-28T08:56:52  <antimatroid1> i agree with that^^
2010-11-28T08:57:07  <Error323> top 300ish is exponentially harder to gain rank
2010-11-28T08:57:14  <Error323> don't know the exponent htough :P
2010-11-28T08:57:26  <Zoo> and not to mention not every programmer is cut out to make a good ai dev
2010-11-28T08:57:37  * antimatroid1 is a maths student :)
2010-11-28T08:57:51  <Error323> and some ai devs tried some really outlandish stuff which may have failed
2010-11-28T08:57:52  * burny is a problem solver :\
2010-11-28T08:57:56  <antimatroid1> and game theory nut
2010-11-28T08:57:57  * Mistmanov is a biophycist ^^
2010-11-28T08:57:58  <Error323> like the evolutionary programmers
2010-11-28T08:58:16  <Mistmanov> yeah there are probbly a few of those
2010-11-28T08:58:25  <Mistmanov> the "tried something cool and failed"
2010-11-28T08:58:29  <antimatroid1> although, mega1 did his masters in ai
2010-11-28T08:58:39  <Mistmanov> but if the cared about the ranking, they would then have tried something more conventional
2010-11-28T08:58:45  <medrimonia> Mistmanov: It's not only about genius, but I think being in top 200 is already meaning that you can be a little bit perseverant
2010-11-28T08:59:18  <Error323> and then there's age difference, programming experience etc
2010-11-28T08:59:24  <Mistmanov> persistent.. or just really good at finding excuses for not having to work at your actual job/classes/etc :p
2010-11-28T08:59:27  <burny> I wish I had some more time, to come up with a proper way of sending my troops to the front lines :\
2010-11-28T08:59:40  <Mistmanov> <<--- should've been doing something else while working on the contest
2010-11-28T08:59:51  <burny> I had to just hack somethign in, in the last 30mins before deadline

2010-11-28T09:10:04  <Error323> and george will probably be in there somewhere
2010-11-28T09:10:13  <Error323> oh
2010-11-28T09:10:17  <antimatroid1> george is highly ranked
2010-11-28T09:10:24  <medrimonia> And I have been fighting against him the last two weeks
2010-11-28T09:10:25  <antimatroid1> i don't think manwe is that good errir
2010-11-28T09:11:25  <antimatroid1> i broke into top 100
2010-11-28T09:11:40  <Error323> me too i think, when rating is updated

2010-11-28T09:11:52  <antimatroid1> that game required a bit more work
2010-11-28T09:11:59  <medrimonia> I think that for the first french guy, the fight will be quite hard between Doraj8, Manwe and Me
2010-11-28T09:12:13  <antimatroid1> i have to fight smiley for australia

2010-11-28T09:22:45  <antimatroid1> very impressive couple of days effort bot
2010-11-28T09:22:51  <burny> thanks
2010-11-28T09:22:55  <burny> how strong is oldman?
2010-11-28T09:23:00  <antimatroid1> quite strong
2010-11-28T09:23:04  <antimatroid1> top 10 for quite a while
2010-11-28T09:23:16  <burny> I see he was top 20, but only had 1 game listed since latest submission
2010-11-28T09:23:21  <burny> nice
2010-11-28T09:23:53  <burny> seeming like I'm fairly possibly going to be top50

2010-11-28T09:26:13  <antimatroid1> this is so much better with a live leaderboard
2010-11-28T09:26:24  <antimatroid1> for tron they closed the leaderboard off while the final tournament ran :|

2010-11-28T09:27:44  <antimatroid1> there are so many shit maps
2010-11-28T09:27:46  <BaronTrozo> anyone knows if  it will be a final with best players, or it will be tree days tournament??
2010-11-28T09:28:06  <antimatroid1> BaronTrozo: it is intended that the lower ranked sections get frozen over time

2010-11-28T09:28:15  <antimatroid1> it will have information there
2010-11-28T09:28:20  <antimatroid1> shit, there's like 7 servers
2010-11-28T09:29:24  <BaronTrozo> over time??? is there any web where this is explained
2010-11-28T09:29:24  <Error323> yeah its awesome

2010-11-28T09:31:04  <Error323> that's on the 75 final maps i presume?

2010-11-28T09:31:23  <Error323> >_<
2010-11-28T09:31:35  <antimatroid1> i think so, but then it also depends which map we get paired on if we play

2010-11-28T09:32:48  <Error323> well
2010-11-28T09:32:51  <Error323> wouldn't say that
2010-11-28T09:32:56  <Error323> run it on the 75 maps
2010-11-28T09:32:59  <Error323> :)
2010-11-28T09:33:21  <antimatroid1> i didn't run it :P
2010-11-28T09:33:25  <Error323> oh
2010-11-28T09:33:31  <Error323> which bot was that then?
2010-11-28T09:33:40  <antimatroid1> krokokrusa did it
2010-11-28T09:33:43  <antimatroid1> like he said earlier
2010-11-28T09:33:46  <Error323> oh
2010-11-28T09:33:52  <antimatroid1> bix0r into first
2010-11-28T09:33:55  <krokokrusa> I can run on 75 official maps, but it would take ages :)
2010-11-28T09:33:59  <antimatroid1> i can't go for him
2010-11-28T09:34:04  <antimatroid1> he used java, that is not acceptable
2010-11-28T09:34:08  <Error323> i'll download ur code antimatroid1
2010-11-28T09:34:13  <krokokrusa> antimatroid1's bot is very cpu heavy
2010-11-28T09:34:20  <antimatroid1> super heavy
2010-11-28T09:34:25  <antimatroid1> i'll use my 1 second damnit!
2010-11-28T09:34:42  <antimatroid1> that wasn't in response to the other day though, it's the nature of a game tree
2010-11-28T09:34:53  <krokokrusa> antimatroid1: I tried C++ too if you look into my submission's list :)
2010-11-28T09:35:13  <antimatroid1> java?
2010-11-28T09:35:16  <antimatroid1> why?
2010-11-28T09:35:34  <antimatroid1> i pretty much completely rewrote from the start package
2010-11-28T09:35:46  <antimatroid1> i even changed to handling the input differently
2010-11-28T09:35:47  <krokokrusa> I just develop a lot faster in Java
2010-11-28T09:36:04  <krokokrusa> me too
2010-11-28T09:36:13  <krokokrusa> starter bot in Java spent way too much time parsing
2010-11-28T09:36:27  <krokokrusa> like 30 ms or so :))) I don't recall
2010-11-28T09:37:19  <antimatroid1> i never tested if my way was faster, but i would be very surprised if it isn't
2010-11-28T09:37:48  <antimatroid1> i capped myself processing information to 0.3 seconds, just in case it was horribly inefficient
2010-11-28T09:38:02  <antimatroid1> i just deal with wrong information if that ever happens, which would be absurd

2010-11-28T09:54:51  <GreenTea> my stategy is very similar..
2010-11-28T09:55:18  <antimatroid1> did anyone else do something along the lines of minimax?

2010-11-28T09:56:06  <GreenTea> Im not will be surprised if algorithms of all top bots are very similar...
2010-11-28T09:56:40  <antimatroid1> yeah, i expect they'll be reasonably different
2010-11-28T09:56:58  <antimatroid1> i don't think i'm going to get top 10 for this though
2010-11-28T09:57:04  <antimatroid1> might get top 30
2010-11-28T09:57:18  <dmj111> antimatroid1: when I get a chance, I will describe more, but I tried to do a 2-ply best first search, with lots of pruning ahead of tmie.
2010-11-28T09:57:40  <antimatroid1> burny: you beat jimrogerz too!
2010-11-28T09:58:00  <antimatroid1> dmj111: i implemented a new game tree idea today, and submitted it :P
2010-11-28T09:58:26  <antimatroid1> it generates each two layers, picks the best strategy combination, then keeps generating from that
2010-11-28T09:58:39  <dmj111> cool.
2010-11-28T09:59:13  <BaronTrozo> IOURI i heve read your post, where you explained your bot, i did something very similar I expect that my bot have almost the same great results as yours.

2010-11-28T10:02:30  <antimatroid1> amstan: rankings are all over the show
2010-11-28T10:02:44  <antimatroid1> some good bots clearly have only tested against other good bots recently
2010-11-28T10:03:01  <antimatroid1> poo i lost a game
2010-11-28T10:03:38  <davidjliu> poo, my bot just timed out :(
2010-11-28T10:03:43  <antimatroid1> ouch
2010-11-28T10:04:09  <davidjliu> heh, at this rate I'm pretty sure I'll never get into the top 100
2010-11-28T10:04:29  <antimatroid1> davidjliu: a lot of people are losing etc.
2010-11-28T10:04:33  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't be too worried yet
2010-11-28T10:04:35  <amstan> this is quite interesting
2010-11-28T10:04:48  <amstan> the rankings are nothing like before the closing
2010-11-28T10:04:48  <Error323> yea

2010-11-28T10:05:46  <amstan> nice to see uwaterloo in 86th
2010-11-28T10:05:52  <antimatroid1> here comes mcleopold
2010-11-28T10:05:55  <antimatroid1> he's right near me
2010-11-28T10:06:07  <amstan> antimatroid1: rank?
2010-11-28T10:06:21  <Error323> nooooooo I'm 181 ;_;
2010-11-28T10:06:35  <amstan> lavalamp is 99th

2010-11-28T10:06:52  <antimatroid1> amstan: burny is 13th!
2010-11-28T10:06:58  <antimatroid1> that is astounding
2010-11-28T10:07:10  <antimatroid1> and a little depressing for me
2010-11-28T10:07:16  <Error323> i think its still to randomish atm
2010-11-28T10:07:24  <antimatroid1> he beat some good bots to get there

2010-11-28T10:07:52  <bhasker> aww i lost my first game
2010-11-28T10:08:02  <antimatroid1> imagine if everyone overshot the optimal target
2010-11-28T10:08:10  <antimatroid1> but they didn't know, cause they all did it gradually
2010-11-28T10:08:17  <bhasker> wow burny is doing quite well
2010-11-28T10:08:30  <bhasker> for 2 weeks of work
2010-11-28T10:08:31  <bhasker> thats awesome
2010-11-28T10:08:51  <Error323> wow indeed

2010-11-28T10:09:50  <bhasker> if anyone is interested
2010-11-28T10:09:51  <amstan> antimatroid1: he was doing it like crazy before
2010-11-28T10:09:55  <bhasker> its a pile of mess
2010-11-28T10:09:56  <antimatroid1> oh yeah
2010-11-28T10:09:56  <Error323> i'm still 1v1ing against anti =)
2010-11-28T10:10:02  <Error323> its taking forever
2010-11-28T10:10:09  <Error323> whilest my pc is quite powerfull
2010-11-28T10:10:25  <Error323> and my turnspeed is ~0.0004s
2010-11-28T10:10:26  <amstan> @rankings
2010-11-28T10:10:27  <contestbot> amstan: Top 10 players: ChrisH(2824), _iouri_(2737), GreenTea(2735), bix0r4ever(2717), _Astek_(2663), george(2650), medrimonia(2617), CorwinAlex(2605), mogron(2591), Polsky(2585)
2010-11-28T10:10:27  <amstan> they changed
2010-11-28T10:10:43  <Error323> is there anyone who hasn't lost yet?
2010-11-28T10:10:48  <amstan> yep
2010-11-28T10:10:48  <antimatroid1> chrisH
2010-11-28T10:10:49  <amstan> top
2010-11-28T10:10:50  <antimatroid1> he is owning
2010-11-28T10:10:50  <Error323> can you query that easily
2010-11-28T10:10:51  <Error323> ah
2010-11-28T10:10:56  <bhasker> so amstan how are the games being decided now
2010-11-28T10:11:00  <bhasker> as in the pairing
2010-11-28T10:11:05  <antimatroid1> same as before
2010-11-28T10:11:06  <amstan> bhasker: i'm not sure
2010-11-28T10:11:11  <Error323> wow
2010-11-28T10:11:14  <amstan> yeah, as far as i know..
2010-11-28T10:11:25  <amstan> i think the randomness is caused by the few games
2010-11-28T10:11:33  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-28T10:11:43  <amstan> which was caused by the reset of rankings at closing
2010-11-28T10:11:57  <amstan> they should go back
2010-11-28T10:11:59  <bhasker> well i am not complaining lol my bot is doing quite well right now
2010-11-28T10:12:11  <Error323> mine is not >:(
2010-11-28T10:12:19  <antimatroid1> bhasker: :)
2010-11-28T10:12:21  <bhasker> yea i saw that
2010-11-28T10:12:26  <bhasker> #181 or so
2010-11-28T10:12:36  <bhasker> you seem to be losing to some good bots though
2010-11-28T10:12:36  <Error323> though last version beats urs 110/80 bhasker against 0.23 that is
2010-11-28T10:12:43  <bhasker> oh this is not 0.23
2010-11-28T10:12:46  <bhasker> this is the max version
2010-11-28T10:12:49  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-28T10:12:53  <amstan> i should get a special rankings mode..
2010-11-28T10:12:57  <amstan> for people in here
2010-11-28T10:13:08  <bhasker> max one kind of upsets good bots too
2010-11-28T10:13:10  <Error323> amstan: oh yeah that would be awesome
2010-11-28T10:13:12  <bhasker> though it loses to bad ones too ll
2010-11-28T10:13:14  <bhasker> lol*
2010-11-28T10:13:17  <dmj111> We'll see what happens with the rankings.  This may be reason to not seed new submissions back at the old ranking.
2010-11-28T10:13:18  <antimatroid1> amstan: what you really need is a page of "latest games"
2010-11-28T10:13:29  <antimatroid1> dmj111: already discussed :)
2010-11-28T10:13:34  <dmj111> my bad.
2010-11-28T10:13:37  <Error323> yep
2010-11-28T10:13:44  <antimatroid1> just pointing out we agree :)
2010-11-28T10:13:50  <Error323> always restart at ~mediaan
2010-11-28T10:13:53  <bhasker> i think dmj it will settle down to the same, from what I can see right now bots are all over the place
2010-11-28T10:14:03  <bhasker> TCP elo ratings are good indicator of bot strengt
2010-11-28T10:14:08  <bhasker> and i don't see the order match up yet
2010-11-28T10:14:26  <antimatroid1> the problem with tcp rankings is you are playing against other reasonably good bots
2010-11-28T10:14:27  <Error323> true
2010-11-28T10:14:35  <antimatroid1> it doesn't klet you know how you perform against not so good bots
2010-11-28T10:14:38  <Error323> tcp is only good after atleast a night of play though
2010-11-28T10:14:42  <bhasker> yes but it gives you some kind of idea who you should be rated below
2010-11-28T10:14:46  <antimatroid1> i beat clusterteam :)
2010-11-28T10:14:51  <bhasker> like i know my bot is not stronger than dmjs/barontrozo etc
2010-11-28T10:14:58  <bhasker> nor accoun
2010-11-28T10:15:06  <bhasker> so i should be rated below them on official
2010-11-28T10:15:19  <medrimonia> 13 Wins / 1 Draw / 2 Loss at the moment
2010-11-28T10:15:20  <bhasker> right now i am above dmj even
2010-11-28T10:15:40  <antimatroid1> i'm 14 wins, 2 loses
2010-11-28T10:15:44  <bhasker> just by looking at bots i couldn't beat on tcp i can see that rankings are not stable
2010-11-28T10:15:47  <Error323> 16 games, 12 wins, 4 losses
2010-11-28T10:15:53  <Error323> 5 losses -.-
2010-11-28T10:15:58  <antimatroid1> bhasker: yep, they'll take a while to settle

2010-11-28T10:16:33  <bhasker> oh wait did we change the maps for the tourney?
2010-11-28T10:16:34  <antimatroid1> Accoun: they're far too shit to have been preselected
2010-11-28T10:16:37  <bhasker> are these completely new maps?
2010-11-28T10:16:40  <antimatroid1> some of them are awful :(
2010-11-28T10:16:41  <Error323> Accoun: be quiet, or give a mathmatical proof on why its so bad
2010-11-28T10:16:44  <antimatroid1> bhasker: yes
2010-11-28T10:16:47  <bhasker> oooh
2010-11-28T10:16:55  <bhasker> then it may change the ordering lol

2010-11-28T10:17:03  <antimatroid1> same genreator
2010-11-28T10:17:06  <bhasker> cause everytime we changed the maps the bot ratings changed a bit
2010-11-28T10:17:11  <bhasker> yea even with same generator
2010-11-28T10:17:23  <bhasker> at least thats what i saw
2010-11-28T10:17:39  <bhasker> its a bit of luck sometimes you just get maps that don't trigger certain buggy behaviour
2010-11-28T10:17:46  <bhasker> like selection of planets on turn 1
2010-11-28T10:17:53  <bhasker> that can make or break a game
2010-11-28T10:18:00  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-11-28T10:18:07  <antimatroid1> but that's the whole point
2010-11-28T10:18:12  <bhasker> wtf did someone delete the post?
2010-11-28T10:18:15  <antimatroid1> and what i like

2010-11-28T10:20:09  <bhasker> and yea the map is bad
2010-11-28T10:20:14  <amstan> that was a draw against a 130th!

2010-11-28T10:20:46  <bhasker> asavis i think is a top 20 bot at least
2010-11-28T10:20:48  <bhasker> if i remember

2010-11-28T10:21:02  <antimatroid1> asavis is number 1
2010-11-28T10:21:03  <Error323> is his name as-* on tcp?
2010-11-28T10:21:11  <antimatroid1> i assume so
2010-11-28T10:21:12  <bhasker> probably i think
2010-11-28T10:21:15  <Error323> if so, then yes his bot was pretty good
2010-11-28T10:21:17  <bhasker> those bots are quite good
2010-11-28T10:21:20  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-28T10:21:21  <amstan> he had 10 games at closing, i wouldn't day that's accurate
2010-11-28T10:21:22  <amstan> 8348,asavis,196006             1644  223  223    10
2010-11-28T10:21:34  <antimatroid1> he had been up near the top for a few days
2010-11-28T10:21:35  <Error323> no thats not even close to accurate
2010-11-28T10:21:36  <bhasker> yea but amstan if his bots were named as-e/d01/2/3
2010-11-28T10:21:38  <antimatroid1> at least i'm pretty sure
2010-11-28T10:21:39  <bhasker> they are quite good
2010-11-28T10:21:40  <amstan> dmj though.. seems to do much better
2010-11-28T10:21:47  <amstan> 108 games, he hwas 8th
2010-11-28T10:21:55  <amstan> seemed*

2010-11-28T10:23:44  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i don't like that
2010-11-28T10:23:49  <bhasker> without a reset can't do that
2010-11-28T10:23:56  <antimatroid1> i think the maps sort of need to be stuck to
2010-11-28T10:23:57  <bhasker> cause people who lost on the bad maps
2010-11-28T10:23:57  <Error323> nah imo don't do anything now anymore
2010-11-28T10:24:00  <bhasker> it will affect their rating
2010-11-28T10:24:01  <Error323> or you will piss ppl off
2010-11-28T10:24:06  <Mistmanov> handselecting maps -->> I can imagine how a certain person is going to respond ;)
2010-11-28T10:24:17  <antimatroid1> i would agree with him then
2010-11-28T10:24:26  <amstan> ok.. just saying..
2010-11-28T10:24:32  <amstan> it's an option.. to get more maps
2010-11-28T10:24:36  <bhasker> more maps yes
2010-11-28T10:24:39  <bhasker> replace maps no
2010-11-28T10:24:46  <Error323> agree
2010-11-28T10:24:46  <Mistmanov> say like... 999 at least :p
2010-11-28T10:24:47  <krokokrusa> more maps isn't fair too
2010-11-28T10:24:49  <bhasker> i think adding maps everyone will agree too
2010-11-28T10:24:51  <heikoh> a decent bot should just perform well on any map, given that both players share the same advantage/disadvantages of the map
2010-11-28T10:24:53  <amstan> Mistmanov: 1999!
2010-11-28T10:24:53  <bhasker> why krokok?
2010-11-28T10:24:55  <margoth> more yes, replace no ++
2010-11-28T10:24:59  <bhasker> adding maps should not change anything
2010-11-28T10:25:05  <Mistmanov> unless someone has already played 2 games on the same map, adding maps won't change anythin
2010-11-28T10:25:09  <antimatroid1> i think more maps should be considered
2010-11-28T10:25:12  <krokokrusa> bhasker: because it changes probabilities of getting an old map
2010-11-28T10:25:13  <antimatroid1> the maps atm are terrible
2010-11-28T10:25:17  <amstan> Mistmanov: +1
2010-11-28T10:25:25  <bhasker> aah
2010-11-28T10:25:25  <bhasker> true
2010-11-28T10:25:30  <bhasker> that statement is true
2010-11-28T10:25:31  <antimatroid1> janzert: are you about?
2010-11-28T10:25:31  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-28T10:25:36  <Mistmanov> although, with 4000 players, there's a good chance that someone has already played a duplicate map
2010-11-28T10:25:38  <Error323> there is a high probability that someone has already played on the same map twice
2010-11-28T10:25:48  <krokokrusa> if, when the new maps are added, not all people played on all maps equally, it's not fair
2010-11-28T10:25:56  <antimatroid1> krokokrusa is right
2010-11-28T10:25:58  <antimatroid1> we're stuck with them
2010-11-28T10:25:59  <bhasker> so i guess no way to do it without a full reset
2010-11-28T10:26:07  <antimatroid1> and we can't do a full reset
2010-11-28T10:26:10  <antimatroid1> we're stuck with them
2010-11-28T10:26:20  <Mistmanov> I wouldn't mind a full reset -_-
2010-11-28T10:26:23  <bhasker> lol
2010-11-28T10:26:34  <antimatroid1> mistmanov: you would understand why it can't be done
2010-11-28T10:26:35  <bhasker> how is your bot doing mist
2010-11-28T10:26:46  <Error323> where has the unleash ur code thread gone off to? i lost it
2010-11-28T10:26:46  <Mistmanov> meh, crappy enemy selection :p
2010-11-28T10:26:48  <amstan> resetting would be like handselecting scores then
2010-11-28T10:26:55  <Mistmanov> haven't had a single high ranking opponent yet
2010-11-28T10:27:00  <Mistmanov> and lost 3 out of 14 against bad players
2010-11-28T10:27:06  <Error323> Mistmanov: good :P
2010-11-28T10:27:08  <antimatroid1> yeah, unfortunately i think maps must stay :(
2010-11-28T10:27:10  <antimatroid1> they are so shit
2010-11-28T10:27:11  <Mistmanov> so I'm stuck in 250-ville
2010-11-28T10:27:14  <Error323> however, so have I >_<
2010-11-28T10:27:17  <bhasker> ouch
2010-11-28T10:27:20  <antimatroid1> i'm allowed to say that, cause in a way i made them
2010-11-28T10:27:27  <antimatroid1> so i'm only insulting myself :)
2010-11-28T10:27:28  <amstan> Mistmanov: pretty sure that's not the ranking's fault, if your bot was good you wouldn't have lost against those bad players
2010-11-28T10:27:39  <Mistmanov> well, true :p
2010-11-28T10:27:45  <Mistmanov> losses were my own fault
2010-11-28T10:27:54  <Error323> yeah this is optimization against top bots
2010-11-28T10:27:58  <Mistmanov> but that's more like.. my bot is just REALLY crappy on some map types
2010-11-28T10:28:06  *** BaronTrozo <BaronTrozo!553c37f9@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.60.55.249> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2010-11-28T10:28:07  <Error323> same here
2010-11-28T10:28:13  <foucist> why would map types affect yoru bots
2010-11-28T10:28:27  <antimatroid1> the current pairing method has the issue that your final ranking is not independent of the order in which you win your games
2010-11-28T10:28:33  <bhasker> cause ultimately everyone is using some heuristics
2010-11-28T10:28:33  <antimatroid1> but it's better than the old method
2010-11-28T10:28:36  <bhasker> they just break down sometimes
2010-11-28T10:28:40  <Error323> yep
2010-11-28T10:28:44  <bhasker> so on some maps you always do horribly
2010-11-28T10:28:52  <bhasker> mostly its a turn 1 problem
2010-11-28T10:28:53  <antimatroid1> foucist: the point is just that a lot of the generated maps are very uninteresting
2010-11-28T10:28:59  <Error323> my bot is different
2010-11-28T10:29:00  <krokokrusa> foucist: for example, sparse maps with small number of planets give more time to search a tree :)
2010-11-28T10:29:06  <Error323> it doesn't do horribly on some maps :P
2010-11-28T10:29:12  <medrimonia> I tried to update my bot to be at least have a good start on each kind of maps, it seems to be helping for the beginning
2010-11-28T10:29:24  <bhasker> yea medri turn 1 makes a lot of difference
2010-11-28T10:29:29  <bhasker> just going for the center or not
2010-11-28T10:29:33  <bhasker> can make or break a game
2010-11-28T10:29:44  <Error323> oh yeh
2010-11-28T10:29:44  <bhasker> frankly i liked the symmetrical maps from before
2010-11-28T10:30:01  <bhasker> actually i think there should be no planet in center
2010-11-28T10:30:04  <Error323> oh I like the linesymmertry aswell
2010-11-28T10:30:09  <bhasker> :)
2010-11-28T10:30:16  <Error323> bhasker: wut
2010-11-28T10:30:22  <Error323> no man, that's cool stuff =)
2010-11-28T10:30:28  <foucist> antimatroid1: uninteresting to the poor bot that has to think about it? ;)
2010-11-28T10:30:36  <Error323> it requires precise calculations
2010-11-28T10:30:40  <foucist> antimatroid1: all the maps seem equally interesting to me
2010-11-28T10:30:51  <medrimonia> I love those mirror maps

2010-11-28T10:31:21  <Mistmanov> foucist: well, some maps just have 1 relatively simple ideal strategy. First turn expand to 2-3 close planets, and then do nothing for the rest of the game
2010-11-28T10:31:33  <Mistmanov> and wait for the othet guy to make a mistake
2010-11-28T10:31:36  <amstan> jmpespxoreax: hey

2010-11-28T10:32:57  <Mistmanov> Error323 and I have completely different bots as far as I'm aware, but we had a draw on 8 out of 75 official maps
2010-11-28T10:32:58  <antimatroid1> i'm at 36, slowly rising
2010-11-28T10:33:04  <antimatroid1> i hope it keeps rising
2010-11-28T10:33:06  <bhasker> mine hasn't gotten a game in quite sometime:-\
2010-11-28T10:33:10  <bhasker> stuck at 70
2010-11-28T10:33:27  <bhasker> is tcp updated with these maps?
2010-11-28T10:33:30  <medrimonia> I'll be falling down I think later, but It's still quite fun
2010-11-28T10:33:33  <antimatroid1> Mistmanov: :| that's terrible
2010-11-28T10:33:37  <bhasker> maybe we should start up tcp with just these maps
2010-11-28T10:33:39  <antimatroid1> but nothing can be done
2010-11-28T10:33:40  <bhasker> and run our bots
2010-11-28T10:33:43  <bhasker> and see how they perform
2010-11-28T10:33:54  <foucist> so have any of you used EC or NN etc in this?
2010-11-28T10:33:57  <Error323> yeah we have 8 draws and our bots _are_ completely different
2010-11-28T10:33:59  <antimatroid1> we would need mcleopold
2010-11-28T10:34:02  <foucist> instead of heuristics
2010-11-28T10:34:13  <Error323> I tried alphabeta
2010-11-28T10:34:18  <Error323> see my alphabeta branch
2010-11-28T10:34:24  <antimatroid1> foucist: i use a minimax tree kind of
2010-11-28T10:34:28  <Error323> but it failed at comming up with a proper eval function
2010-11-28T10:34:34  <Error323> mega1_: what is ur eval function?
2010-11-28T10:34:38  <foucist> antimatroid1: that sounds like heuristics though?
2010-11-28T10:34:39  <Error323> tell us pleaaaaaaaaaze
2010-11-28T10:34:52  <j3camero> Oh man I am back!

2010-11-28T10:35:36  <foucist> Error323: you don't think of alphabeta as a heuristic thing?
2010-11-28T10:35:39  <antimatroid1> foucist: in a way yeah, but it's not just, pick move make move, pick move make move either
2010-11-28T10:35:41  <bhasker> added 0.23 version of the bot as well

2010-11-28T10:35:51  <Error323> foucist: well, yes but on a higher level
2010-11-28T10:36:05  <amstan> j3camero: mega's going up apparently

2010-11-28T10:37:21  <foucist> Mistmanov: i can't imagine that just sitting on 3 planets would be the optimal strategy, the enemy bot would have to be right next door to not even bother colonizing some more planets ?
2010-11-28T10:37:27  <bhasker> wow 158 games per minute right now

2010-11-28T10:37:38  <bhasker> it is optimal
2010-11-28T10:37:50  <bhasker> most of the other planets are too expensive

2010-11-28T10:38:28  <foucist> ok

2010-11-28T10:38:57  <foucist> by first weakening it

2010-11-28T10:41:05  <foucist> yeah tbh i'd rather just write code that generates all the strategies itself somehow

2010-11-28T10:45:59  <Mistmanov> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8890691 at turn 37, he attacks the central neutral. A ridiculous move since I can snipe it (and I do, from the planet on the right). But since no one makes such a move, I never spotted the bug where my supply thing captures the planet first from the north..
2010-11-28T10:46:23  <Mistmanov> which makes me lose the game ^^
2010-11-28T10:46:28  <antimatroid1> where can i do it at code.google?

2010-11-28T10:55:40  <Error323> bhasker: yes, well its not hard if i can read it you can too i'm sure. But it gives a good base on how it works and why its so much better
2010-11-28T10:55:40  <bhasker> looks interesting

2010-11-28T10:57:57  <Error323> yep
2010-11-28T10:58:06  <Error323> well as long as you don't put binary data into it
2010-11-28T10:58:13  <Error323> they should fix that
2010-11-28T10:58:19  <amstan> ?
2010-11-28T10:58:24  <Error323> if it could handle binary good aswell then its epic
2010-11-28T10:58:41  <amstan> git can handle binary just fine, it's just not pretty

2010-11-28T11:00:14  <Error323> game assets, like 3D files, photoshop files, content
2010-11-28T11:00:17  <bhasker> haha thanks antimatroid
2010-11-28T11:00:49  <antimatroid1> thank amstan :P
2010-11-28T11:00:51  <bhasker> error323 don't most game companies use custom asset management tools
2010-11-28T11:00:58  <bhasker> i doub they maintain it in an SCM
2010-11-28T11:01:08  <Error323> well I'm intern at one
2010-11-28T11:01:12  <bhasker> ah which one?
2010-11-28T11:01:13  <Error323> and they use perforce
2010-11-28T11:01:18  <Error323> guerrilla games
2010-11-28T11:01:32  <bhasker> i have been thinking of joining one
2010-11-28T11:01:34  <bhasker> for a lon time
2010-11-28T11:01:35  <foucist> Error323: many assets i leave outside of the SCM.. depending on how static they are etc

2010-11-28T11:02:15  <foucist> Error323: unless an asset is directly changeable i wouldn't put it in a SCM, i'd just use a standard backup process, timestamp it or whatever
2010-11-28T11:02:42  <amstan> the moment you add it to an scm, you effectively double it's size
2010-11-28T11:02:49  <antimatroid1> lol, my bot has like a HUGE bug i think
2010-11-28T11:02:56  <amstan> since you have to store it both in the scm and the working dir
2010-11-28T11:03:00  <antimatroid1> that's kind of funny that it's doing well
2010-11-28T11:03:06  <Error323> well that's easy to say for the geeks
2010-11-28T11:03:17  <bhasker> focuist doesn't work in a big company
2010-11-28T11:03:21  <bhasker> with thousands of assets
2010-11-28T11:03:25  <Error323> but if you don't know squad about this stuff (most artists don't) you just want to be able to "update"
2010-11-28T11:03:25  <bhasker> you need some revisioning
2010-11-28T11:03:28  <Error323> and be up to date
2010-11-28T11:03:30  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-28T11:03:34  <Error323> and not zipfiles
2010-11-28T11:03:41  <bhasker> and you want reproducable builds
2010-11-28T11:03:45  <antimatroid1> oh wow, my bot is not doing what i think at all aha
2010-11-28T11:03:53  <antimatroid1> that's incredible
2010-11-28T11:03:59  <bhasker> you don't want wrong versions of binaries/models being pulled in the next time you do a build
2010-11-28T11:04:09  <heikoh> working at a gaming company as well, all assets are put in svn, and indeed most artists don't know anything about such stuff
2010-11-28T11:04:19  <bhasker> which one heikoh
2010-11-28T11:04:24  <heikoh> khaeon games

2010-11-28T11:06:56  <antimatroid1> amstan: i'm more worried about it being my submitted bot :P
2010-11-28T11:07:02  <antimatroid1> but it's currently in 36th place
2010-11-28T11:07:06  <antimatroid1> 3 losses, one a crash
2010-11-28T11:07:36  <antimatroid1> i'm going to run the current version against a corrected version and see what happens
2010-11-28T11:07:44  <antimatroid1> with any luck the submitted one is better anyway
2010-11-28T11:07:58  <amstan> did you guys know you could edit the files directly on github? i only discovered this recently

2010-11-28T11:22:14  <Error323> ye he is a good coder
2010-11-28T11:22:47  <bhasker> though his code in gametimeline isnot really the most understandable
2010-11-28T11:22:56  <Error323> I wrote a simulator
2010-11-28T11:23:04  <bhasker> ye ai saw your code
2010-11-28T11:23:10  <aizu> oh wow, I'm +500 ranks from when the deadline hit
2010-11-28T11:23:11  <Error323> I don't see why ppl didn't do that
2010-11-28T11:23:20  <Error323> https://github.com/Error323/googleai/blob/heuristics/Simulator.cc
2010-11-28T11:24:01  <bhasker> well my bot does something similar
2010-11-28T11:24:03  <bhasker> gamestate.py
2010-11-28T11:24:08  <bhasker> takes the state and fleets
2010-11-28T11:24:10  <bhasker> and resolves
2010-11-28T11:24:15  <bhasker> and has an evaluate function
2010-11-28T11:24:19  <bhasker> to get a score for the state

2010-11-28T11:24:28  <antimatroid1> could that be avanish dixit?
2010-11-28T11:24:39  <bhasker> no he is my colleague
2010-11-28T11:24:48  <bhasker> works in my team
2010-11-28T11:24:50  <antimatroid1> ah, that would be avanash
2010-11-28T11:24:55  <bhasker> he didnt spend much time on it though
2010-11-28T11:25:04  <bhasker> though looks like last 4 days he has been active
2010-11-28T11:25:30  <bhasker> mega1 #9 now
2010-11-28T11:25:31  <antimatroid1> i'm at 31 :(

2010-11-28T11:25:36  <antimatroid1> that pesky crash!!

2010-11-28T11:25:54  <bhasker> for me
2010-11-28T11:26:09  <Error323> bhasker: mmm i wonder wether your bot is better than mine
2010-11-28T11:26:11  <Error323> it might be
2010-11-28T11:26:19  <bhasker> though iceharley just owned me http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8904376
2010-11-28T11:26:25  <bhasker> i doubt it error
2010-11-28T11:26:28  <bhasker> probably close to even
2010-11-28T11:26:29  <bhasker> try it out
2010-11-28T11:26:35  <bhasker> or worse
2010-11-28T11:26:37  <Error323> yeah gotta find ur source
2010-11-28T11:26:48  <bhasker> oh its on the post
2010-11-28T11:26:58  <bhasker> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1168&start=20#p7836
2010-11-28T11:27:14  <bhasker> bot max ( my last submission) and 0.23
2010-11-28T11:27:25  <Error323> ok
2010-11-28T11:27:31  <Error323> well i know about 0.23
2010-11-28T11:27:35  <Error323> though not on new mapset
2010-11-28T11:27:48  <bhasker> yea i was debating if i should just reupload 0.23
2010-11-28T11:27:53  <contestbot> Top 10 players: george(2999), medrimonia(2973), _iouri_(2941), _Astek_(2929), GreenTea(2920), jimrogerz(2919), Neverstu(2905), protocolocon(2904), bocsimacko(2898), mogron(2867)
2010-11-28T11:27:54  <bhasker> then i decided against it
2010-11-28T11:27:58  <bhasker> cause i like the new version better loo
2010-11-28T11:28:00  <bhasker> lol*
2010-11-28T11:28:04  <bhasker> it does more interesting stuff
2010-11-28T11:28:10  <bhasker> 0.23 is a very boring conservative bot
2010-11-28T11:28:36  <Error323> bhasker: do I need MyBot.py or malazanbot.py?
2010-11-28T11:28:42  <bhasker> both are the same
2010-11-28T11:28:49  <bhasker> i just run it using malazanbot.py
2010-11-28T11:28:55  <Error323> oh right
2010-11-28T11:28:55  <bhasker> but for official i kept mybot.py
2010-11-28T11:29:00  <antimatroid1> yeah, i normally have a set arrive time for my fleets, but it is nice and aggressive if i send any fleets now that arrive when they owne the planet (and didn't just claim neutral)
2010-11-28T11:29:20  <antimatroid1> but sometimes it gets a little too agressive, i added it in again right at the end and it seems to be paying off for the moment
2010-11-28T11:29:33  <bhasker> heh mistakes that help are not bugs but features
2010-11-28T11:29:55  <antimatroid1> bugs provide character
2010-11-28T11:30:05  <bhasker> though error323 you may want to change logutils.py to not spout debug logs
2010-11-28T11:30:19  <Error323> oh its running already
2010-11-28T11:30:20  <Error323> oh well
2010-11-28T11:30:21  <bhasker> otherwise it outputs like over 100mb of logs per game:)
2010-11-28T11:30:33  <Error323> doesn't matter much :P
2010-11-28T11:30:42  <bhasker> it slows down the bot a lot
2010-11-28T11:30:45  <Error323> i'll brb gonnna make some food
2010-11-28T11:30:47  <antimatroid1> smiley isn't doing very well :D

2010-11-28T11:33:09  <Error323> antimatroid1: i think he's hitting refresh 100 times a second ;)
2010-11-28T11:33:11  <bhasker> should not output any logs now
2010-11-28T11:33:31  <bhasker> i don't think he has anything to be worried
2010-11-28T11:34:02  <bhasker> unless someone comes out of the blue his bot will pretty much win this competition for sure
2010-11-28T11:34:03  <antimatroid1> george he needs to worry about
2010-11-28T11:34:12  <bhasker> don't think george's bot is as good as mega1s

2010-11-28T11:35:17  <krokokrusa> it would be fun to take all open-sourced bots and make 1 bot from them
2010-11-28T11:35:23  <Error323> but ya know... i love holland ^_^
2010-11-28T11:35:24  <bhasker> there is sloppybot too

2010-11-28T11:35:29  <j3camero> Rankings are fluctuating a bit. We'll see how long it takes to settle down.
2010-11-28T11:35:31  <krokokrusa> turn by turn
2010-11-28T11:35:32  <Error323> yeah I know I beat him for a fact

2010-11-28T11:36:33  <bhasker> will probably mess up things krokor
2010-11-28T11:36:53  <bhasker> if you line up a bad bot after a good one
2010-11-28T11:37:10  <krokokrusa> if, say, only 10 bots are used
2010-11-28T11:37:20  <krokokrusa> then deviation from normal bot's prediction won't be more than 10 turns
2010-11-28T11:37:36  <bhasker> 10 turns is enough to make or break a bots game
2010-11-28T11:37:39  <bhasker> heck one bad luanch
2010-11-28T11:37:41  <krokokrusa> it should be able to patch things up, maybe :)

2010-11-28T11:38:28  <antimatroid1> then playing them against each other and picking the best moves like that?

2010-11-28T11:39:08  <bhasker> what would be interesting would be to

2010-11-28T11:39:18  <bhasker> on each turn
2010-11-28T11:39:20  <bhasker> then pick the best one
2010-11-28T11:39:32  <bhasker> and see if that makes a better bot ^
2010-11-28T11:39:43  <bhasker> give same state to all 10 bots
2010-11-28T11:39:48  <bhasker> and collect result /evaluate

2010-11-28T11:40:05  <bhasker> hehe not neccessarily unless we know his eval function
2010-11-28T11:40:19  <bhasker> his eval function surely is not the simple one i am using
2010-11-28T11:40:20  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-28T11:40:27  <Error323> 34 wins, 35 losses, rest is draw. you are better by 1 game on this mapset

2010-11-28T12:34:02  <Error323> antimatroid1: ur bot is mostly extremely slow :P
2010-11-28T12:34:14  <antimatroid1> Error323: yep
2010-11-28T12:34:32  <McLeopold> GreenTea: did you beat account in a game on my zeroviz server, or in the finals?  You should post a link.
2010-11-28T12:34:39  <mega1_> Error323: is that so? wow
2010-11-28T12:34:41  <Ken69267> oh you cant send ships = 0 on tcp?
2010-11-28T12:34:46  <Ken69267> that would be why :p
2010-11-28T12:34:56  <McLeopold> It's dhartmei's code... ask him.

2010-11-28T12:36:31  <McLeopold> You only lose to me. :)
2010-11-28T12:36:34  <rebelxt_> Accoun: relax, man.. there is no conspiracy
2010-11-28T12:36:56  <Error323> indeed, maps are just generated with the mapgen.py, its all fair.
2010-11-28T12:37:19  <antimatroid1> Account: I got you that time!
2010-11-28T12:37:22  <Error323> and america landed on the moon
2010-11-28T12:37:23  <Error323> =)
2010-11-28T12:37:25  <antimatroid1> damn, i did it too
2010-11-28T12:37:38  <McLeopold> It's the maps that get drawn.  My bot does very good if the best strategy is to wait and snipe.
2010-11-28T12:38:07  <McLeopold> I do badly when you are far away and it's good to build fast, then I always get behind.
2010-11-28T12:38:08  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: sounds like you are me, don't make many actual moves each turn?
2010-11-28T12:38:15  <antimatroid1> most of my fleets are all show
2010-11-28T12:38:38  <McLeopold> No, I make a lot of moves.  Some of them are just to reserve fleets on a planet.
2010-11-28T12:38:42  <Accoun> this contest- playing agnust organizers
2010-11-28T12:39:04  <burny> aw, I've got a bunch of losses now.. still holding a high rank yet though
2010-11-28T12:39:16  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: you just did 100 ships to the center planet...

2010-11-28T12:39:23  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: so what does your bot do? i might have missed if you already mentioned
2010-11-28T12:39:51  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: yep :)
2010-11-28T12:39:54  <antimatroid1> and i'd do it a gain
2010-11-28T12:40:01  <boegel> are pairs of bots picked in a special way during the final round<
2010-11-28T12:40:03  <boegel> ?
2010-11-28T12:40:18  <boegel> cause my win/loss streaks are kind of striking... http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=7846
2010-11-28T12:40:24  <McLeopold> Basically, I predict the future and look for holes in the enemy defense.
2010-11-28T12:40:27  <antimatroid1> although i ended up losing
2010-11-28T12:40:33  <burny> :(   I'm gona have tons of losses cause of this crap.  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8895479
2010-11-28T12:40:34  <rebelxt_> boegel, looks like the same match making algorithm is used.. i.e. normally close rankings are paired
2010-11-28T12:40:48  <McLeopold> I have giant lists of numbers on max ships at every given planet at every turn.

2010-11-28T12:41:11  <antimatroid1> not quite
2010-11-28T12:41:18  <McLeopold> I then do some crazy ordering of every planet to pick the best target.
2010-11-28T12:41:36  <McLeopold> I'm using ROI, so distance + num_ships/growth_rate
2010-11-28T12:42:00  <McLeopold> Then I add some extra distance to return to the center so I value the center more.
2010-11-28T12:42:26  <Error323> I sort enemyplanets on weakness, and attack the planet that has is the hardest to defend
2010-11-28T12:42:28  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: i'd say our bots are about equal
2010-11-28T12:42:33  <Error323> but its not always optimal
2010-11-28T12:42:36  <McLeopold> My bot doesn't try to expand too fast, it only tries to be a little growth over the opponent.
2010-11-28T12:42:56  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3241), protocolocon(3222), _Astek_(3167), GreenTea(3148), george(3142), jimrogerz(3138), medrimonia(3132), CorwinAlex(3111), Accoun(3100), _iouri_(3093)
2010-11-28T12:43:05  <McLeopold> Yeah, target selection is a big weakness in my bot.
2010-11-28T12:43:18  <davidjliu> Almost in the top 150 now!
2010-11-28T12:43:25  <antimatroid1> my weakness is sending ships from planets i shouldn't and not making enough proper moves each turn
2010-11-28T12:43:30  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: i see. interesting. some aspects are similar to mine
2010-11-28T12:43:41  <McLeopold> davaidjliu: how were you even not in the top 150?
2010-11-28T12:43:41  <antimatroid1> davidjliu: I had a crash too :)
2010-11-28T12:43:47  <McLeopold> oh
2010-11-28T12:43:51  <davidjliu> I had a crash on one
2010-11-28T12:43:58  <rebelxt_> davidjliu: did you have a slow start?
2010-11-28T12:44:02  <davidjliu> and my bot tends to always lose on some maps
2010-11-28T12:44:07  <Ken69267> meh
2010-11-28T12:44:10  <Ken69267> tcp hates me
2010-11-28T12:44:11  <antimatroid1> don't they all :P
2010-11-28T12:44:17  <davidjliu> I lost to one guy around 400, timed out against one around 300
2010-11-28T12:44:28  <McLeopold> ouch
2010-11-28T12:44:28  <davidjliu> but I still have a 88% winnig percentage
2010-11-28T12:44:31  <davidjliu> heh
2010-11-28T12:44:33  <Ken69267> I wonder if its the map
2010-11-28T12:44:46  <antimatroid1> i've had a few losses on the main server lately
2010-11-28T12:44:46  <McLeopold> Ken69267:are you not connecting right, or just losing?
2010-11-28T12:45:20  <Error323> McLeopold: is it only official mapset atm?
2010-11-28T12:45:24  <Error323> on zeroviz?
2010-11-28T12:45:25  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-28T12:45:29  <Error323> good
2010-11-28T12:45:31  <Ken69267> McLeopold: it just returns to a terminal, and the site says (I)
2010-11-28T12:46:10  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: is your bot as slow as mine?
2010-11-28T12:46:14  <McLeopold> oh, invalid orders, I see
2010-11-28T12:46:17  <antimatroid1> someone else must be using their time up
2010-11-28T12:46:30  <burny> so is the top 10 now, looking just about right?
2010-11-28T12:46:31  <McLeopold> I think I'm running with the 1 second limit
2010-11-28T12:46:41  <Ken69267> is there anyway to tell why it craps out on tcp
2010-11-28T12:46:44  <antimatroid1> not really
2010-11-28T12:46:49  <McLeopold> yeah, hold on

2010-11-28T12:47:55  <rebelxt_> burny: no i don't think top10 is settled at this point

2010-11-28T13:09:00  <GreenTea> My first bot also have only set of moves and evaluation function to chose the best. But it is really hart to write good evaluation function..
2010-11-28T13:09:04  <McLeopold> so, who's narnach?
2010-11-28T13:09:08  <Error323> if i'm not in top 100 tomorrow i'll cry
2010-11-28T13:09:09  <Error323> :P
2010-11-28T13:09:11  <rebelxt_> c++ helps.. when i ported my early bot from python to c++, i got 35x speed improvement..
2010-11-28T13:09:17  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: i think i might take top spot on your tcp in a minute :P
2010-11-28T13:09:23  <narnach> McLeopold: me! :-)
2010-11-28T13:09:25  <Error323> yeah c++ is sweet
2010-11-28T13:09:27  <burny> nearly every one of my losses against top100 bots, is because I don't re-enforce the front lines properly
2010-11-28T13:09:48  <antimatroid1> c++ <3
2010-11-28T13:09:59  <McLeopold> I lost to rebelxt_, as soon as he rises up, so will I
2010-11-28T13:10:21  <antimatroid1> ah crap, i might lose this game to accoun
2010-11-28T13:10:38  <rebelxt_> Error323: you will get there today! i just did, and your bot is beating me on tcp at the moment
2010-11-28T13:10:39  <antimatroid1> no, i think i have it again
2010-11-28T13:10:55  <Accoun> when i ported my early bot from perl to C, i got 101x speed improvement..
2010-11-28T13:11:17  <Error323> rebelxt_: heh well it doesn't say eveerything but ye i do think i'll end up in #100
2010-11-28T13:12:06  <antimatroid1> http://zeroviz.us:8080/antimatroid.html :D
2010-11-28T13:12:25  <McLeopold> I really gotta take down the 8080...

2010-11-28T13:19:35  <burny> I'm finding the same thing for me anti... it makes me cry, how simple the things I'm losing to are
2010-11-28T13:19:39  <antimatroid1> if my bot properly saved itself from stupid moves it'd probably be a hell of a lot better

2010-11-28T13:20:07  <burny> like, turn 1, decide that attacking some planet is a good idea..
2010-11-28T13:20:19  <burny> and then turn 4, decide it can't defend it(even though it can)
2010-11-28T13:20:58  <burny> a number of games against top20 bots that I lost like that, that would have otherwise won
2010-11-28T13:21:40  <burny> that, and deciding "if I attack that planet, I can defend it".. and attacking it.. and then losing everything expcet that planet in the next few turns

2010-11-28T13:21:57  <antimatroid1> burny: i have the exact same problems

2010-11-28T13:22:13  <antimatroid1> often in the middle of a battle i'll just send everything i have pretty much across the whole map
2010-11-28T13:23:14  <McLeopold> Ken69267: you're sending 2 "go" commands in a row
2010-11-28T13:23:30  <antimatroid1> go go gadget!

2010-11-28T13:23:46  <antimatroid1> when you finish making your turn, you need to output go
2010-11-28T13:23:51  <antimatroid1> you're doing it twice

2010-11-28T13:29:48  <GreenTea> why to send 100 ships to far isolated planet?
2010-11-28T13:30:19  <McLeopold> rebelxt_: you're bouncing your fleets all over my back line :)
2010-11-28T13:30:30  <antimatroid1> oh aha, now that i wouldn't do again, it's because the planets are at an equal distance and it "thinks" (stupidly) that they need to both all out battle for that planet

2010-11-28T13:45:41  <Error323> indeed.
2010-11-28T13:45:47  <BaronTrozo> almost oall of the code is done at 1a.m. - 2a.m.
2010-11-28T13:45:55  <antimatroid1> my code is not safe for anyones eyes
2010-11-28T13:46:34  <BaronTrozo> with variables name some in sapnish, some in english and some variables with part in spanish and part on english
2010-11-28T13:46:46  <Error323> BaronTrozo: ouch :P
2010-11-28T13:46:48  <Error323> whyyyyy.
2010-11-28T13:47:07  <antimatroid1> god damnit, i want the greek alphabet and common maths relations etc. on my keyboard and usable in programs
2010-11-28T13:47:10  <rebelxt_> all of my variables are a,b,c,...z for ease of reading
2010-11-28T13:47:11  <BaronTrozo> becasue it was done at 1 a.m.
2010-11-28T13:47:13  <rebelxt_> j/k
2010-11-28T13:47:32  <Error323> BaronTrozo: that's no excuse to go spanish on us :P
2010-11-28T13:48:03  <BaronTrozo> okey, but first i will clean the code before publishing it

2010-11-28T13:49:31  <medrimonia> BaronTrozo: Me too, I've a mix of french and english in my variables
2010-11-28T13:50:02  <Error323> rebelxt_: 44-2-29 you mean you win 44 times of me?
2010-11-28T13:50:16  <Error323> cuz that's a lot :/
2010-11-28T13:50:19  <BaronTrozo> and also the english part, are writting in my own english, that of xourse is diferent than cambrige one
2010-11-28T13:51:22  <rebelxt_> Error323: yep mine was ahead.. but i don't think that's a big difference. let me run on a bigger 500-map set
2010-11-28T13:52:09  <Error323> mm
2010-11-28T13:52:11  <rebelxt_> i doubt 75 maps is a good test.. i was normally doing 250 maps in local tests to get a decent picture which bot is stronger

2010-11-28T13:52:58  <antimatroid1> it uses it's full second
2010-11-28T13:53:00  <Error323> 1 sec a turn
2010-11-28T13:53:15  <antimatroid1> and it's not that simple to just adjust either
2010-11-28T13:53:18  <GreenTea> I have 5 map sets for local testing. 100, 100, 200, and 2x200 generated by new generator
2010-11-28T13:53:33  <rebelxt_> ok, i will make my seconds shorter to speed it up ;)
2010-11-28T13:53:58  <antimatroid1> rebelxt_: it'll just crash on you :)
2010-11-28T13:54:25  <rebelxt_> will it cause blue screen of death on ubuntu? and permanent damage to hard drive?
2010-11-28T13:54:37  <antimatroid1> no, but it wont give accurate results

2010-11-28T14:04:43  <Mistmanov> I think the canadians are chiting to keep the dutch people out

2010-11-28T14:09:40  <Error323> same everywhere :P
2010-11-28T14:09:43  <antimatroid1> my bot falls to pieces once there are a lot of takeable planets though

2010-11-28T14:10:40  <Error323> and doing it poorly aswell sometimes :/

2010-11-28T14:42:33  <GreenTea> something strange with bix0r4ever..
2010-11-28T14:42:36  <politik> hi all. is there any talk of another contest? I found out about this one too late
2010-11-28T14:42:46  <bhasker> i just seem to be getting games against whiteside

2010-11-28T14:43:04  <bhasker> grats david i guess the reset is throwing people around a lot
2010-11-28T14:43:15  <bhasker> people from the top 50 are still outside the top 100
2010-11-28T14:43:34  <Error323> amazing how you are 1 game better than me bhasker
2010-11-28T14:43:35  <Error323> =)
2010-11-28T14:43:53  <bhasker> heh against you not necessarily against others though
2010-11-28T14:44:06  <Error323> mja dunno
2010-11-28T14:44:07  <bhasker> you may be stronger against other opponents for all you know
2010-11-28T14:44:12  <Error323> but it'll be close i think
2010-11-28T14:44:16  <bhasker> barontrozo just broke my winning streak on tcp
2010-11-28T14:44:21  <Error323> we'll dance around eachother =)
2010-11-28T14:44:22  <bhasker> !@#!
2010-11-28T14:44:25  <bhasker> hehe hopefully
2010-11-28T14:44:30  <bhasker> i think rebelxt will be close too
2010-11-28T14:44:36  <bhasker> his bot is also of similar strength
2010-11-28T14:44:52  <politik> did anyone here end up doing minimax?
2010-11-28T14:45:01  <bhasker> quite a few people
2010-11-28T14:45:03  <bhasker> i think antimatroid
2010-11-28T14:45:06  <bhasker> E323 gave it a shot

2010-11-28T14:46:00  <politik> ah, what rank was it?
2010-11-28T14:46:16  <politik> I would think even very dumb eval would be alright, compared to most bots
2010-11-28T14:46:27  <bhasker> the problem is not really just the eval though
2010-11-28T14:46:30  <GreenTea> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=9309   OMG SUA...
2010-11-28T14:46:31  <bhasker> its also the move generation
2010-11-28T14:46:45  <GreenTea> he was in top 50
2010-11-28T14:46:46  <politik> I did a half-ply with just ship count as eval, and it's not good but it's not awful
2010-11-28T14:46:49  <bhasker> yea i remember
2010-11-28T14:47:00  <bhasker> how does one do a half ply
2010-11-28T14:47:06  <bhasker> isnt a ply one move by one player
2010-11-28T14:47:11  <Error323> Mistmanov: yeah it seems we'll go really really slow
2010-11-28T14:47:12  <Error323> bah
2010-11-28T14:47:19  <politik> I think a ply is a full move by both players
2010-11-28T14:47:24  <politik> thats how it is in chess anyway
2010-11-28T14:47:38  <politik> I think... googling..
2010-11-28T14:47:45  <bhasker> ply is one move
2010-11-28T14:47:48  <Mistmanov> I hope they don't do the cut-off to soon :p
2010-11-28T14:47:49  <bhasker> by one player
2010-11-28T14:47:50  <Error323> ply is one move iirc
2010-11-28T14:47:52  <Error323> ye
2010-11-28T14:47:58  <politik> ah, you're right
2010-11-28T14:48:03  <Mistmanov> like that tomorrow they're already going to stop playing everyone besides top100 -_-
2010-11-28T14:48:25  <Error323> ?
2010-11-28T14:48:41  <Mistmanov> I hope they don't do that :p
2010-11-28T14:48:45  <Mistmanov> the probably won't
2010-11-28T14:49:03  <politik> wow, seems sudden to go to top 100
2010-11-28T14:49:07  <politik> maybe top 300
2010-11-28T14:49:35  <bhasker> i think top 100 will be at least a day off
2010-11-28T14:49:40  <politik> they should cut off the bottom ~4000 anyway, so many people just submitted ragebot or something
2010-11-28T14:49:53  <bhasker> i thought it was totally 4000 odd bots
2010-11-28T14:50:12  <politik> 4619
2010-11-28T14:50:15  <Error323> imo playing top 500 is good enough right?
2010-11-28T14:50:26  <Error323> at 200 gpm
2010-11-28T14:50:57  <politik> I would think it would be sort of adaptive, where if your rating is moving, you get more games
2010-11-28T14:51:00  <bhasker> how is it that on zeroviz
2010-11-28T14:51:07  <politik> but it seems to be totally spread evenly
2010-11-28T14:51:11  <bhasker> there is e323-final at 249 elo
2010-11-28T14:51:16  <bhasker> and the next bot is mine at -55 elo
2010-11-28T14:51:22  <bhasker> shouldn't there be something in the middle
2010-11-28T14:51:28  <bhasker> or a more gradual fall off in elo
2010-11-28T14:51:33  <Error323> it only shows active bots bhasker
2010-11-28T14:51:39  <bhasker> oooh nm
2010-11-28T14:51:40  <bhasker> doh
2010-11-28T14:51:41  <Error323> but there's a lot in between
2010-11-28T14:51:50  <Mistmanov> http://tcp.zeroviz.us/ratings.html
2010-11-28T14:51:56  <Mistmanov> too late ---
2010-11-28T14:52:47  <politik> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=14232 7 submissions, and the last one doesn't even play
2010-11-28T14:52:50  <bhasker> looks like mistmanov is beating you e323
2010-11-28T14:52:51  <politik> poor guy
2010-11-28T14:53:04  <Error323> bhasker: YEAH :( :(( :(
2010-11-28T14:53:09  <Error323> I think he'll win
2010-11-28T14:53:22  <Error323> unless the random generator is on my side :P
2010-11-28T14:53:24  <Mistmanov> assuming the server is ever going to give me some good games :p
2010-11-28T14:53:32  <Mistmanov> I think that in theory
2010-11-28T14:53:45  <Error323> i'm almost #1 of NL
2010-11-28T14:53:51  <Mistmanov> it's perfectly possible to just get a crap map every time that I get a good opponent (like every 20 games)
2010-11-28T14:53:51  <Error323> with Mistmanov on my tail
2010-11-28T14:53:52  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-28T14:54:27  <bhasker> who is Ken and narnach on tcp and whiteside?
2010-11-28T14:54:42  <bhasker> as of now those seem to be the only bots i can beat ^

2010-11-28T15:04:03  <Error323> bhasker: nooooooooo don't go out of 100
2010-11-28T15:04:12  <bhasker> still at #98!
2010-11-28T15:04:13  <Error323> that prolly means the same for me :S :S :S
2010-11-28T15:04:15  <bhasker> holding on
2010-11-28T15:04:15  <politik> anyone do random playouts, i.e. Monte Carlo? I considered that since it seems to be great for Go AI
2010-11-28T15:04:29  <Mistmanov> I think that running your CPU at full speed in order to run the bot locally comes close to costing 3 cents per hour in energy consumption..
2010-11-28T15:04:49  <bhasker> hmm probably does
2010-11-28T15:05:23  <rebelxt_> bhasker, Error323, Mistmanov, all or us are not where we are used to be but i feel ratings are too volatile at the moment, so let's keep our hopes up! go, bots!
2010-11-28T15:05:23  <Mistmanov> a kwh is something like 12 cents, so if your cpu takes 250w (it doesn't, but eh..), it would cost 3 cents per hour
2010-11-28T15:05:42  <Error323> rebelxt_: indeed :D
2010-11-28T15:05:47  <bhasker> lol yea rebel... lets cheer for our bots!
2010-11-28T15:05:48  <Mistmanov> yeah, I'm certainly expecting to still breach the top 100 :p

2010-11-28T15:11:35  <Error323> i'll run Mistmanov aswell
2010-11-28T15:11:43  <Mistmanov> hurray!
2010-11-28T15:11:51  <Error323> see if i can get it to work
2010-11-28T15:11:59  <Mistmanov> I wonder.. do you guys really check the entire code to see if it isn't going to blow up your computer?
2010-11-28T15:12:03  <bhasker> yay beat accoun finally!
2010-11-28T15:12:12  <bhasker> i don't think anyone is doing that mist lol
2010-11-28T15:12:20  <rebelxt_> Mistmanov: i run on EC2 so it's a JAIL
2010-11-28T15:12:21  <Mistmanov> (not that my code blows up your computer, but that's one of the things that makes me wary of running other people's code :p)
2010-11-28T15:12:35  <bhasker> i didnt run other's code either
2010-11-28T15:12:38  <bhasker> thats why i rely on tcp
2010-11-28T15:12:41  <bhasker> to do all my testing
2010-11-28T15:12:49  <rebelxt_> except for antima's which is running locally so he might blow something up hehe

2010-11-28T15:13:05  <bhasker> so be careful!
2010-11-28T15:13:13  <bhasker> though maybe if he was one you have something to worry

2010-11-28T15:13:47  <mega1_> all my losses so far are on maps with low planet counts
2010-11-28T15:13:50  <Mistmanov> yeah, he's just pretending to not be a programmer so you won't search for the keylogger that he cunningly hid in some future state calculations ;)
2010-11-28T15:13:50  <rebelxt_> looking at antima's code.. maybe all my passwords are gone now
2010-11-28T15:14:36  <bhasker> mega1 your bot will this tourney
2010-11-28T15:14:39  <bhasker> i think that is decided
2010-11-28T15:14:44  <bhasker> now its for rank 2-100
2010-11-28T15:14:50  <bhasker> you can go rest

2010-11-28T15:36:15  <MistmanovsGhost> yeah that's probably quite common
2010-11-28T15:36:29  <MistmanovsGhost> for me it's because some of my heuristics are pretty good
2010-11-28T15:36:39  <MistmanovsGhost> and some are really bad (e.g., the "can I take a neutral?")
2010-11-28T15:36:54  <MistmanovsGhost> and some maps just invoke one set of heuristics, and other maps another set
2010-11-28T15:37:40  <MistmanovsGhost> maps where you would have two clear front planets would be a disaster for me
2010-11-28T15:37:46  <MistmanovsGhost> since it would require coordinated attacks

2010-11-28T16:12:58  <rebelxt_> yep 33 wins for you, 3 draws

2010-11-28T16:13:39  <rebelxt_> what's interesting is that you win very fast.. avg turns for you to win only 117, for me 151
2010-11-28T16:13:57  <MistmanovsGhost> yeah I either win fast or I lose ^^
2010-11-28T16:14:04  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-28T16:14:10  <Error323> same here

2010-11-28T16:14:16  <MistmanovsGhost> maps with a lot of direct fighting often go may way
2010-11-28T16:14:33  <MistmanovsGhost> maps with a lot of expanding and waiting for ships to replenish go horribly
2010-11-28T16:14:43  <rebelxt_> ok, medrimonia2 up next. python vs python. this is gonna be super painful for my bot
2010-11-28T16:14:53  <Error323> I was losing a lot at first, then I figured ok once binary knapsack is done, i'll remove the center planets and save my ships... then BOOM top 40 :P

2010-11-28T16:17:51  <Error323> how is it doing
2010-11-28T16:18:07  <mega1_> 29/1/7 so far for me
2010-11-28T16:18:13  <Error323> nice
2010-11-28T16:18:18  <rebelxt_> what's everyone's horizon? i.e. number of turns you use when calculating expected value of planet captured.. if you used such a metric in eval function
2010-11-28T16:18:46  <Error323> well sometimes i simulate to the end
2010-11-28T16:18:49  <Error323> without moves though
2010-11-28T16:18:52  <Error323> just to see who'd win
2010-11-28T16:19:02  <Error323> if its the enemy i'll cap neutrals
2010-11-28T16:19:19  <rebelxt_> do you simulate to 200 even on first turn?
2010-11-28T16:19:25  <Error323> yes
2010-11-28T16:19:28  <Error323> its rlly fast

2010-11-28T16:20:15  <Error323> oh i never tried that :$
2010-11-28T16:20:25  <politik> I go to 20 turns, just because thats what I guessed last night when I got it working :)

2010-11-28T16:25:45  <Error323> lol ok
2010-11-28T16:26:03  <politik> one thing I thought of today that I wish I tried... in the eval of the game at the N turn horizon, *divide* my ship count by the enemy ship count, rather than subtracting. then even exchanges in attacks are a win, would make my bot more aggressive
2010-11-28T16:26:51  <politik> with subtracting, the bot ends up being conservative, so it doesn't use it's advantage
2010-11-28T16:27:02  <rebelxt_> mega1_: was accon the one with highest win rate against you?
2010-11-28T16:27:13  <GreenTea> "*divide* my ship count by the enemy ship count" i do such thing..

2010-11-28T16:30:44  <Error323> how do you guys compute the frontline
2010-11-28T16:31:16  <Error323> my method is: if i'm the closest planet to an enemy planet i'm frontline.
2010-11-28T16:31:17  <rebelxt_> mega1_: woah, so iuri only gets two more wins that i did. that's weird since he appears way stronger than my bot.
2010-11-28T16:31:31  <mega1_> rebelxt_: different map set
2010-11-28T16:31:39  <rebelxt_> ahh right
2010-11-28T16:31:54  <mega1_> different number of maps too

2010-11-28T16:32:38  <politik> mega1_: do you know what your bot does that is unique, or is it a mystery to you why it is so awesome? :)
2010-11-28T16:32:51  <MistmanovsGhost> Error323: the "if I'm closest to an enemy planet I'm front line" is also at the basis of my front calculation yes, but I also try to look into the future..
2010-11-28T16:33:07  <Error323> MistmanovsGhost: ah yes so do i
2010-11-28T16:33:11  <Error323> for the feeding part
2010-11-28T16:33:18  <MistmanovsGhost> like.. if planet X is going to send to ships to Y, Y needs to be the front when the ships arrive

2010-11-28T16:46:19  <Error323> with my too extreme lookahead lol

2010-11-28T16:46:24  <Error323> xD
2010-11-28T16:46:40  <Error323> why didn't i think of that
2010-11-28T16:46:54  <politik> I dunno, thats like the only thing I *did* think of :)

2010-11-28T16:47:23  <dmj111> the last big change I made was to change how far I looked ahead based on the closest distance between my planets and the enemy planets.
2010-11-28T16:47:53  <Error323> mja i should've done that too
2010-11-28T16:47:58  <rebelxt_> Error323: well, it's probably a 10% improvement if you optimize horizon. not dramatic.. it seems to matter the most on the first turn
2010-11-28T16:48:01  <Error323> cuz this is just >_< frustrating
2010-11-28T16:48:25  <Error323> dmj111: will you publish code?
2010-11-28T16:48:34  <rebelxt_> dmj111: hey, curious if your bot is heuristic as well like most?
2010-11-28T16:48:45  <dmj111> yeah, I will.   I am too depressed at the moment.

2010-11-28T16:49:24  <Error323> just takes more time
2010-11-28T16:49:27  <dmj111> I am rising.  I had my hopes up after the last few weeks :)

2010-11-28T16:50:05  <Error323> I learned to _always_ trust statistical data
2010-11-28T16:50:05  <dmj111> rebelxt_: It is mostly heuristic.   I do a 2-ply lookahead, against my own heuristics.
2010-11-28T16:50:10  <Error323> and not look at first losses :P
2010-11-28T16:50:11  <politik> bix0r4ever is #27, I don't understand that either. I thought he was top 5 consistently

2010-11-28T16:58:35  <rebelxt_> politik: it does.. i burnt lots of cpu cycles to find optimal value
2010-11-28T16:58:52  <politik> I don't blame youdid you say you did 60?
2010-11-28T16:59:00  <politik> jesus I keep half-finishing things
2010-11-28T16:59:06  <meneky> mine is 40 turns, i tested increasing it, but it didnt work
2010-11-28T16:59:45  <Error323> politik: yes 60
2010-11-28T16:59:48  <Error323> it was better
2010-11-28T16:59:55  <politik> I think dmj111's approach of making it proportional to distance to enemy is the best... that's the measure of how uncertain you are about how quickly the enemy could change the state
2010-11-28T16:59:58  <rebelxt_> i did something weird.. which is 40 + (max_distance_between_planets - distance), then multiply by growth and subtract cost if it's neutral
2010-11-28T16:59:59  <Error323> yep
2010-11-28T17:00:09  <sigh> I did 50, for what it's worth
2010-11-28T17:00:18  <Error323> rebelxt_: that is weird indeed :P
2010-11-28T17:00:35  <politik> rebelxt_: wow
2010-11-28T17:00:53  <politik> what is distance, distance of the move you're considering?
2010-11-28T17:01:01  <rebelxt_> yes
2010-11-28T17:01:15  <Error323> )#$(%)#$(*%)#($%@ 102
2010-11-28T17:01:16  <dmj111> rebelxt_: i tried something similar, but it didn't make mine better.
2010-11-28T17:02:00  <rebelxt_> if max distance is 30, then neutral's value is essentially (70 - distance) * growth - cost
2010-11-28T17:02:25  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@112.134.122.232> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-28T17:02:26  <rebelxt_> if it's enemy, then multiply by two since enemy loses production, and you gain, so the score is twice as big
2010-11-28T17:02:41  <politik> hm so that is sort of valuing closer planets higher... makes sense
2010-11-28T17:02:54  <rebelxt_> dmj111: curious what worked the best for you?
2010-11-28T17:02:56  <politik> sounds semi-hard to tune though
2010-11-28T17:03:12  <Error323> I used: growth^2 / (ships * distance + epsilon)
2010-11-28T17:03:14  <politik> still seems like distance-to-enemy should be in there somewhere
2010-11-28T17:03:52  <politik> maybe distance-to-enemy - distance? but that will give quite low numbers
2010-11-28T17:04:02  <politik> distance-to-enemy being the distance of the target planet to the enemy
2010-11-28T17:04:14  <rebelxt_> politik: distance to enemy is taken into account since i only attack as long as i can actually capture the target.. so i can get more ships to the planet than enemy can to be able to hold it until profit
2010-11-28T17:04:48  <GreenTea> I calc rating to neutral this way: getGrowthRate() / (getShipsCount() + distanceTo(x, y) * getGrowthRate());, where x y is center of mass of my planets..
2010-11-28T17:04:59  <politik> ok, that's based on the assumption that the enemy will attack it with everything? makes sense
2010-11-28T17:05:16  <GreenTea> siple and effective formula
2010-11-28T17:05:17  <rebelxt_> politik: yeah, a worst case scenario
2010-11-28T17:05:39  <Ken69267> these new maps are destroying my bot :(

2010-11-28T17:06:54  <rebelxt_> so many ways to skin a cat ;)
2010-11-28T17:07:07  <GreenTea> =)
2010-11-28T17:07:10  <dmj111> rebelxt_: I'm not sure I can explain a little, instead of a lot.  I'll work on commenting my code, and try to get it out.
2010-11-28T17:07:18  <sanddbox> GreenTea, i use a constant
2010-11-28T17:07:22  <rebelxt_> i really hate magic constants though. some of those were impossible to eliminate by HUNDRED of lines of code
2010-11-28T17:07:23  <Error323> i fear magic constants :P
2010-11-28T17:07:24  <sanddbox> i just put 10 so i didn't have to tell you the value of the constant
2010-11-28T17:07:59  <rebelxt_> dmj111: ok. looking forward to it
2010-11-28T17:09:06  <GreenTea> i tried to use as less constants as possible - because this is synthetic thing..
2010-11-28T17:09:21  <sanddbox> "as less constants"
2010-11-28T17:09:29  <sanddbox> i try to use as much proper english as possible
2010-11-28T17:09:33  <rebelxt_> the most magic constant i have is 140.. that thing is still there /sigh
2010-11-28T17:09:36  <sanddbox> as few constants is correct
2010-11-28T17:09:58  <GreenTea> yes, thank you)

2010-11-28T17:10:01  <GreenTea> few

2010-11-28T17:13:43  <sanddbox> GreenTea, same
2010-11-28T17:13:44  <politik> hm even from turn 1?
2010-11-28T17:13:45  <sanddbox> i did that from the start
2010-11-28T17:13:50  <sanddbox> well
2010-11-28T17:13:56  <Error323> figuring out when to capture neutrals and which is imo hardest part of this contest

2010-11-28T17:14:04  <GreenTea> in turn 1 growth ratie is same (5)
2010-11-28T17:14:09  <sanddbox> i expand if my growth is <= to the opponent
2010-11-28T17:14:18  <Error323> sanddbox: so do i
2010-11-28T17:14:22  <GreenTea> rebelxt_: yes)
2010-11-28T17:14:25  <Error323> in the future*

2010-11-28T17:36:16  <meneky> the question then is, will they?
2010-11-28T17:37:13  <GreenTea> I hope next contest will be next year in the same months
2010-11-28T17:38:04  <meneky> not sure, i think last contest finished on feb/mar
2010-11-28T17:38:21  <narnach> so twice a year seems likely if they continue doing this
2010-11-28T17:38:27  <narnach> which I hope they do :-)
2010-11-28T17:38:55  <GreenTea> make it more frequent than once a year, I don't know..
2010-11-28T17:39:11  <GreenTea> it take to much time)
2010-11-28T17:39:13  <meneky> my mental health may not toleate it, but i'd like it
2010-11-28T17:40:09  <GreenTea> how much time you guys spend on this contest?
2010-11-28T17:41:27  <narnach> 50 hours or so, I think

2010-11-28T17:43:12  <GreenTea> i think from 10 october to 27 november - maybe 3-4 hour a day

2010-11-28T17:44:04  <meneky> i started working seriously on it from 1 Oct, almost all my free time dedicated to it (most of it thinking), too much for the result i finally expect
2010-11-28T17:44:36  <meneky> maybe 3 hours a day, weekend plenty more
2010-11-28T17:44:59  <GreenTea> yes, on weekens ~ 10 hours
2010-11-28T17:44:59  <meneky> i followed too many dead ends
2010-11-28T17:45:17  <GreenTea> and 90% of time is testing..
2010-11-28T17:45:42  <GreenTea> against all older versions on different mapsets..
2010-11-28T17:45:49  <politik> wow, I've just been working on it since thursday, and I thought I put in a lot of time...
2010-11-28T17:46:16  <GreenTea> ^_^

2010-11-28T17:53:24  <politik> but yeah I am looking forward to the next one, then I can be obsessed with it from the beginning like you guys :)
2010-11-28T17:54:14  <politik> might be hard to do something as cool as this challenge though... I like the game
2010-11-28T17:56:58  <meneky> me too, it is worth the time and effort, and i agree, the game is very very cool, and real time rankings make it very addictive

2010-11-28T18:49:06  <dmj111> nice :)
2010-11-28T18:49:20  <McLeopold> I think I'm just getting really lucky right now.
2010-11-28T18:49:49  <dmj111> I hear ya.  Its fun anyways...
2010-11-28T18:50:41  <dmj111> I'm amazed at how quick the games are coming now.
2010-11-28T18:51:02  <McLeopold> dmj111: how come your not top 10?  I thought you maintained it the whole time?
2010-11-28T18:51:41  <dmj111> Could be many reasons, first of which that it was a fluke I was in the top 10.
2010-11-28T18:52:01  <dmj111> Since I resubmitted rarely, maybe that gave me an artificial inflation?
2010-11-28T18:52:19  <dmj111> I don't play defense, and maybe  the new maps demand it...
2010-11-28T18:52:21  <McLeopold> I thought that too, but janzert said they only used 3 days of results
2010-11-28T18:52:32  <McLeopold> I do play defense...

2010-11-28T18:53:12  <dmj111> when I say defense, I mean against possible attacks, not attacks already on the way.  Is that what you mean?
2010-11-28T18:53:16  <McLeopold> Maybe a high ranking get's you games with better people, so you don't lose to people way down in the rankings?
2010-11-28T18:53:42  <McLeopold> No, I have defense fleets and security reserves.
2010-11-28T18:53:44  <dmj111> I think that may be it.  I am suseptible to losing to anyone, but can manage to beat the higher bots too.
2010-11-28T18:53:55  <dmj111> Ah, I never got reserves to work.
2010-11-28T18:54:02  <davidjliu_> heh, I have successfully secured myself in the top 100
2010-11-28T18:54:05  <McLeopold> I've gotten some big wins against the top ten so far.

2010-11-28T18:54:35  <McLeopold> Each order I have has a set of 3 numbers, fleets, reserves and boost.

2010-11-28T18:56:57  <dmj111> My bot has lots of bad assumptions that made it hard to improve it much.

2010-11-28T19:20:30  <burny> :(
2010-11-28T19:20:40  <burny> time outs are a pooy way to lose
2010-11-28T19:21:00  <burny> it'd be nice if timeout would just mean that all moves for that turn, aren't executed
2010-11-28T19:21:51  <Ken69267> that would be fair I'd think

2010-11-28T19:29:26  <medrimonia> Normally, at the end, winning five or six games in a streak won't change too much the rankings right?
2010-11-28T19:32:15  <burny> correct
2010-11-28T19:32:24  <GreenTea> "<McLeopold> did the game stats start over for the finals?" finals? what is format of finals?

2010-11-28T19:38:42  <burny> it'd be interesting to see how the results for the top100 would be, with the pairing method beign used, vs 100% random pairing
2010-11-28T19:40:24  <rebelxt_> they mentioned pairing cutoff will be lowered gradually. things should get more interesting

2010-11-28T19:41:01  <burny> rebel, what's that mean?
2010-11-28T19:41:22  <burny> go more and more towards 100% random? or less random?
2010-11-28T19:41:42  <medrimonia> freezing the last players right?
2010-11-28T19:41:45  <rebelxt_> no. just stop playing game for rankings over 1000, 500, 200, 100, etc

2010-11-28T19:42:31  <burny> I need for both me, and the other top 100s.. to play against more of the sub-100 bots
2010-11-28T19:42:37  <rebelxt_> pairing cutoff is a nice way to eliminate all the dual and rage bots and let higher ranks get more games

2010-11-28T19:43:50  <GreenTea> Why no explanation on offical forum...
2010-11-28T19:44:03  <rebelxt_> there is one. let me find a link.

2010-11-28T19:47:35  <rebelxt_> image crazy number of games we will be getting when pairing cutoff is eventually in place
2010-11-28T19:48:07  <medrimonia> yep something like a game every minute
2010-11-28T19:48:12  <rebelxt_> when they drop it to top100 for instance, everyone would be getting two games per minute it seems
2010-11-28T19:48:40  <burny> more like 3 per min
2010-11-28T19:48:41  <meneky> dont think so, top 100 bots are more likely to consume the entire second
2010-11-28T19:48:47  <meneky> per turn

2010-11-28T20:03:09  <bhasker> i have no idea why my bot did that
2010-11-28T20:03:11  <bhasker> !!
2010-11-28T20:03:27  <bhasker> suddenly decided it needed to send 182 ships to another planet
2010-11-28T20:03:28  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-28T20:03:57  <bhasker> though e323 http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8983436
2010-11-28T20:04:40  <rebelxt_> nice
2010-11-28T20:05:06  <bhasker> weird my bot decided to turn a draw into a loss lol
2010-11-28T20:05:10  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-28T20:06:15  <rebelxt_> it's just experimenting with different strategies ;-)
2010-11-28T20:06:19  <bhasker> hehe i wish
2010-11-28T20:06:20  <burny> it probably just thought that sending the 112, would soak up some of their 200, and then your other 200 can capture the side
2010-11-28T20:06:34  <bhasker> i don't have any such code, i think its a bug lol
2010-11-28T20:06:54  <bhasker> oh i thin i know what happened
2010-11-28T20:07:04  <bhasker> it sent the 112 which changed my staging planet
2010-11-28T20:07:05  <bhasker> to the right
2010-11-28T20:07:11  <bhasker> and it sent the ships to the staging
2010-11-28T20:07:12  <rebelxt_> bhasker: 40-31-4
2010-11-28T20:07:16  <bhasker> not bad
2010-11-28T20:07:48  <bhasker> i thought it would do much worse rebel
2010-11-28T20:07:58  <bhasker> wow upto 190 games a minute
2010-11-28T20:08:10  <bhasker> thats a game every 10 minutes?
2010-11-28T20:08:14  <bhasker> almost
2010-11-28T20:08:51  <rebelxt_> well, i did not do any tweaks last few days so this kinda indicates that new map set did not affect relative strength of our bots. good data point for both
2010-11-28T20:09:12  <bhasker> true
2010-11-28T20:09:16  <bhasker> neither did i tweak anything
2010-11-28T20:09:21  <bhasker> i kind of ran out of ideas
2010-11-28T20:09:39  <bhasker> short of a full rewrite
2010-11-28T20:09:43  <bhasker> to do a proper minmax
2010-11-28T20:10:03  <bhasker> hmm #games per minute is still climbing are we spinning up more servers
2010-11-28T20:10:06  <bhasker> upto 200 now
2010-11-28T20:10:45  <bhasker> mcleopold seems to be doing quite well
2010-11-28T20:10:46  <bhasker> #21
2010-11-28T20:10:54  <rebelxt_> i'm almost 50-50 with antimadroid on 200-map test... but significant difference in the rankings. indicates that local tests against other people's bots can still be very misleading ;-)
2010-11-28T20:11:06  <rebelxt_> he is doing great
2010-11-28T20:11:10  <bhasker> yea

2010-11-28T20:12:06  <rebelxt_> bhasker: 200gpm - it's probably playing lowest rated bots now.. i.e. those which issue invalid orders on first turn ;-)

2010-11-28T20:13:18  <bhasker> the sad part though is that there are quite a few bots which haven't been updated in a month or more and are still in the top 50-60
2010-11-28T20:13:30  <bhasker> that shows that not much improvement happened in the last month:-\
2010-11-28T20:13:31  <rebelxt_> bhasker: yeah but some terrible losses ;) i was stuck in 100-200 land for too long hehe

2010-11-28T20:14:08  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-28T20:14:26  <bhasker> rebel you on east coast?
2010-11-28T20:14:42  <rebelxt_> central - austin
2010-11-28T20:14:46  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-28T20:14:52  <bhasker> anyone on the west coast here?
2010-11-28T20:14:55  <bhasker> in the bay area?
2010-11-28T20:15:27  <burny> if the number of losses to a lower-ranked bot effects the ratings much.. then higher ranked bots should all have to face lower bots, some fixed number of times(to balance it out, so some don't get screwed out of points from randomness)
2010-11-28T20:16:07  <bhasker> but the lower ranked bot is a moving target is it not?
2010-11-28T20:16:48  <rebelxt_> burny, i dunno if it's a good idea but yeah some good bots had a slow start due to getting stuck in the low rankings. i think when they start lowering pairing cutoff gradually, things will hopefully settle down eventually
2010-11-28T20:17:14  <jmcarthur> burny: it actually evens out in the end
2010-11-28T20:17:37  <jmcarthur> burny: if you are losing a lot of games to lower ranked bots then your bot isn't very good anyway
2010-11-28T20:17:41  <burny> ya, true.. if when it's only playing top 500 bots, it's more random, and less playing against equal rated bots.. it'll balance out fine
2010-11-28T20:17:52  <jmcarthur> burny: and if a higher ranked bot is able to hold its own in the higher ranks then it certainly deserves to be there
2010-11-28T20:18:05  <burny> jmc, lots of high ranked bots lose a few games to lowbies..
2010-11-28T20:18:12  <jmcarthur> yeah i know it happens
2010-11-28T20:18:20  <burny> and also lots of high rankers, didn't have to play against any lowbies, due to randomness
2010-11-28T20:18:22  <jmcarthur> but nowhere near as often as the lower ranked bots
2010-11-28T20:18:38  <jmcarthur> those high rankers don't get to stay high rank for long
2010-11-28T20:20:58  <bhasker> looks like the low ranked bots are playing i don't see any movement in the top 100 right now
2010-11-28T20:21:26  <burny> asavis and bocs both lost to a 400ish ranked bot
2010-11-28T20:22:57  <burny> I'm sure a number of others have also

2010-11-28T20:35:22  <burny> horrible map? or is taking one of those 81's a good move? http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8989329
2010-11-28T20:36:11  <medrimonia> you should take a 81 I think
2010-11-28T20:36:24  <burny> hm, ya.. probably should
2010-11-28T20:36:47  <medrimonia> the distance between you two is of more than eight and you have a growth of 12
2010-11-28T20:37:06  <medrimonia> so you can take it
2010-11-28T20:37:15  <burny> it's not distance between bases that matters, it's base->target vs opponents base->target
2010-11-28T20:37:23  <medrimonia> (But my bot wouldn't do it too I think)
2010-11-28T20:37:34  <medrimonia> The two matters
2010-11-28T20:37:48  <burny> and the 81 isn't a 5grow
2010-11-28T20:38:06  <medrimonia> No but you've already 12 of growth
2010-11-28T20:38:11  <burny> er, ya nm.. doesn't matter what it's grow is
2010-11-28T20:38:58  <burny> if the 81 is a distance of 5 vs 11 though.. means they can get there, before I get 80 extra units to it
2010-11-28T20:39:24  <medrimonia> yep but I think there's more than eight of difference
2010-11-28T20:39:57  <medrimonia> and at worst, you keep 82 ships in the little planet (2 growth)
2010-11-28T20:40:11  <medrimonia> or even all your ships
2010-11-28T20:40:17  <medrimonia> and here it has to be good
2010-11-28T20:40:39  <medrimonia> But... that's human thinking, not bot thinking
2010-11-28T20:41:12  <burny> I don't think the differece is more than 8
2010-11-28T20:42:18  <burny> er, mayybe.. i estimate 6 vs 15, by appearance

2010-11-28T22:58:38  <dmj111> i think just the contestbot top 10 announcements.
2010-11-28T23:00:05  <mega1_> I see
2010-11-28T23:00:45  <janzert> yes
2010-11-28T23:01:16  <janzert> I did just post in the forums on some more finals details people may be interested in
2010-11-28T23:05:38  <mega1_> cool, thank you
2010-11-28T23:10:31  <janzert> new additional maps coming soon
2010-11-28T23:13:13  <bhasker> how many maps?
2010-11-28T23:13:25  <janzert> another 75
2010-11-28T23:14:01  <janzert> so it will be 150 total
2010-11-28T23:14:21  <bhasker> nice
2010-11-28T23:14:26  <bhasker> should make for interesting games
2010-11-28T23:14:35  <bhasker> btw can you add that counter back
2010-11-28T23:14:43  <bhasker> where it was showing how many games before you get the next game?
2010-11-28T23:14:48  <bhasker> that was kind of cool
2010-11-28T23:14:58  <janzert> sorry, there isn't any easy way to make it work now
2010-11-28T23:15:01  <bhasker> oh
2010-11-28T23:15:02  <bhasker> :-(
2010-11-28T23:15:19  <bhasker> the pairing mechanism is not the same?
2010-11-28T23:15:31  *** Neverstu <Neverstu!~Neverstu@99.190.172.81> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-28T23:15:54  <janzert> pairing itself is but the way the first player is chosen changed, your next game isn't based on the time of the last game but how many games you have played
2010-11-28T23:16:10  *** i_ito <i_ito!7ad8233a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.122.216.35.58> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-11-28T23:16:34  <janzert> so one of the players with the least number of games is randomly chosen and on average that is somewhere a little under half of all the players
2010-11-28T23:17:20  <janzert> I guess it could go by how many other players have the same or less number of games as you
2010-11-28T23:17:48  <janzert> but that would be a pretty heavy query and I'm pretty sure too much load
2010-11-28T23:18:01  <janzert> I'd rather try and keep the server playing as many games as possible
2010-11-28T23:18:22  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-28T23:19:23  <bhasker> and rankings is updated every 10-15 minutes?
2010-11-28T23:20:10  <janzert> currently 10 minutes, as the total number of games increases and it takes longer to calculate that will almost certainly change though
2010-11-28T23:24:28  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-28T23:27:32  <antimatroid> i beat iouri on official over night :)

2010-11-28T23:41:27  <janzert> gratz
2010-11-28T23:42:08  <antimatroid> yeah, it's still making some really stupid moves
2010-11-28T23:42:31  <antimatroid> so i don't think there's any chance of top 10, but it may hang around in the top 30
2010-11-28T23:45:59  <bhasker> i am kind of losing my inclination to write a proper minmax bot now that the competition is over:-\
2010-11-28T23:47:15  <antimatroid> hehe, the bot i uploaded isn't doing what i thought at all
2010-11-28T23:47:43  <antimatroid> but it seems to work so meh aha
2010-11-28T23:47:43  <burny> nice
2010-11-28T23:47:51  <antimatroid> burny: you beat me, you little bugger ! :P:
2010-11-28T23:47:56  <burny> :P
2010-11-28T23:48:06  <antimatroid> my rankings is higher now though :)
2010-11-28T23:48:15  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3885), Accoun(3804), _iouri_(3770), _Astek_(3761), protocolocon(3758), Slin-.-(3744), george(3730), jimrogerz(3727), GreenTea(3723), shangas(3673)
2010-11-28T23:48:18  <burny> ya, I keep getting matched with higher ranked bots
2010-11-28T23:48:26  <burny> and my bot sucks against higher ranked ones
2010-11-28T23:48:30  <antimatroid> i have a win against iouri and a draw against accoun

2010-11-28T23:49:02  <burny> think my best still is a win against bix
2010-11-28T23:51:03  <davidjliu_> heh, still slowly rising
2010-11-28T23:51:11  <antimatroid> davidjliu: :(
2010-11-28T23:51:14  <antimatroid> you had a very rough start
2010-11-28T23:51:44  <davidjliu_> hopefully I finish moving up by the time the contest's over
2010-11-28T23:52:16  <davidjliu_> also, how do I get rid of the underscore after my name?
2010-11-28T23:52:30  <antimatroid> type /nick newnick
2010-11-28T23:52:40  *** davidjliu_ is now known as davidjliu
2010-11-28T23:52:45  <davidjliu> yay. danke
2010-11-28T23:52:48  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-28T23:55:31  <davidjliu> I still have, like, an 80% winning percentage. It's pretty exciting
2010-11-28T23:55:52  <antimatroid> that gets ruined once you're closer to the top :)
2010-11-28T23:55:59  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/profile_games.php?user_id=3945
2010-11-28T23:56:03  <antimatroid> that's my current record :)
2010-11-28T23:56:17  <antimatroid> i make too many stupid moves to get the top ten i think
2010-11-28T23:56:42  <burny> my bot has 2 flaws that's costing it about 90% of it's games :\
2010-11-28T23:56:51  <davidjliu> I lose too often against 400-ranked bots to get to the top ten I think
2010-11-28T23:56:53  <davidjliu> as in twice
2010-11-28T23:56:53  <davidjliu> heh
2010-11-28T23:57:03  <burny> even all kinds of top20 bots I've faced, i would have won, if not for those flaws
2010-11-28T23:57:31  <antimatroid> dmj111: FUUUUUUUU, you beat me
2010-11-28T23:57:33  <burny> bocs and asavis both lost to some 400s
