2011-10-27T00:47:13  <amstan> janzert: can we merge this? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/pull/324
2011-10-27T00:47:31  <janzert> you can but it's broken ;)
2011-10-27T00:47:46  <amstan> it is?
2011-10-27T00:47:50  <a1k0n> if ants from two different players reach food simultaneously, is the food destroyed without spawning anything?
2011-10-27T00:47:50  <janzert> I won't have a chance to fix it up till friday or the weekend probably
2011-10-27T00:47:55  <janzert> yes, it is
2011-10-27T00:47:58  <a1k0n> thx
2011-10-27T00:48:10  <Sakura_Away> Q: What happens when a bot capture more than a piece of food in a turn? Are the 'newborn' queued or "fuck the 4 pieces you ate; just 1 newborn next turn anyway" ?
2011-10-27T00:48:25  <janzert> a1k0n: oops I wasn't talking to you, but yes is still correct for you as well :)
2011-10-27T00:48:25  <a1k0n> queued i assume
2011-10-27T00:48:31  <a1k0n> oh ok. :)
2011-10-27T00:48:47  <Sakura_Away> I also assume, but if we're wrong....
2011-10-27T00:48:55  <amstan> janzert: why is it broken?
2011-10-27T00:48:56  <janzert> amstan: the compiler.py changes are almost certain not to work as is
2011-10-27T00:49:04  <amstan> ic
2011-10-27T00:49:06  <janzert> nor does it add the installation of ada to the worker

2011-10-27T00:49:38  <janzert> well, it adds the installation just in the wrong spot

2011-10-27T00:51:36  <janzert> we never properly settled on apache even
2011-10-27T00:51:50  <Sakura_Away> Also, if you have an ant right on a hill and a newborn arrives from this hill, are one of those two ants dead?  I'm pretty sure as I don't see what could happen else, but, can anyone confirm?
2011-10-27T00:51:51  <janzert> at the beginning of ants we were going to move to bsd or mit but it never happened
2011-10-27T00:52:11  <amstan> we should fix that, some contributors easily get offended if they don't like the license
2011-10-27T00:52:14  <janzert> including those in full in each file wouldn't be so bad :}
2011-10-27T00:52:25  <janzert> meh

2011-10-27T01:09:48  <janzert> rts of course lends itself to nice visualization besides all the other benefits it gives though

2011-10-27T01:11:00  <burny> team based fps/capture the flag style could be neat
2011-10-27T01:11:28  <janzert> pure bot fps is hard to make interesting actually
2011-10-27T01:11:40  <janzert> since a big portion of the traditional fps is about reaction times
2011-10-27T01:11:46  <a1k0n> i worry about all-starter-pack teams
2011-10-27T01:11:51  <burny> it can be fuzzy
2011-10-27T01:12:01  <a1k0n> though with truskill at least the somewhat decent bots would fight together
2011-10-27T01:12:15  <burny> eg. if you are prone, then opponent is less likely to be given your infos
2011-10-27T01:12:21  <janzert> sure you can artificially limit the bots but that's not very interesting
2011-10-27T01:12:36  <burny> if you're running, they'll be more likely to notice you, even if they're facing hte other way, etc.
2011-10-27T01:12:50  <TheDigitalNinja> bzflag bot game :P
2011-10-27T01:13:05  <a1k0n> team games might also have perverse incentives for players vying for "MVP"
2011-10-27T01:13:06  <burny> personally I would love go.. but I think it's WAY above the heads of most people
2011-10-27T01:13:35  <janzert> and go is really too abstract for us as well
2011-10-27T01:14:06  <janzert> a persistent game of some sort would be really sweet
2011-10-27T01:14:14  <janzert> might be hard to pull off well though
2011-10-27T01:14:23  <a1k0n> it's also pretty well-studied.. the answer will be to do whatever the best go bots do already
2011-10-27T01:14:24  <burny> persistent like?
2011-10-27T01:14:45  <janzert> persistent world, not individual separate games
2011-10-27T01:14:50  <burny> rts's are pretty well studied also :P
2011-10-27T01:15:38  <janzert> minecraft for bots :)
2011-10-27T01:15:50  * antimatroid1 is a big fan of simultaneous
2011-10-27T01:16:15  <burny> I can't think of anything that would work as persistent besides something like a stock market sim
2011-10-27T01:16:17  <janzert> actually Eve for bots would be a better analogy I suppose
2011-10-27T01:16:48  <antimatroid1> delt0r was making what sounded like a pretty sweet game
2011-10-27T01:17:08  <amstan> so you either have real time or turn based, not much difference

2011-10-27T01:55:16  <bqf> a1k0n: what i disliked about the mario challenge was that _every last detail_ could be accounted for. if you know exactly how your enemies are going to behave and even know their exact timings, the winner is the one with the best copy of an already existant game model, not the one who comes up with a good idea. (or at least that is what the challenge looked like from an outside perspective. _my_ outside perspective, at that ;))

2011-10-27T03:02:03  <bobbydroptable> isbric then i'm not sure. you should be able to pick up the error messages in the game_log directory ( for python)
2011-10-27T03:02:12  <janzert> basically just have to do it in two places and th rest of the time you can deal with what you're used to

2011-10-27T03:06:55  <bobbydroptable> or you could use bot0.input, and i guess it should replicate the crash

2011-10-27T04:09:59  <grom358> yeah.. but I had no idea TreeSet did that
2011-10-27T04:10:02  <sir_macelon> grom358: aka design fail :)
2011-10-27T04:10:09  <grom358> lol.. yes
2011-10-27T04:10:18  <sir_macelon> grom358: have you ever used it before?
2011-10-27T04:10:38  <grom358> yeah I have
2011-10-27T04:11:01  <sir_macelon> TreeSet is a implementation of Set which by its nature doesn't allow duplicates
2011-10-27T04:11:08  <grom358> I just thought it also checked equals method too
2011-10-27T04:11:37  <grom358> yeah I realise can't have duplicates.. just thought it would use compareTo for order.. and then equals for contains
2011-10-27T04:11:45  <sir_macelon> TreeSet determines duplicates by compareTo method, if it returns 0, the elements are considered as duplicates
2011-10-27T04:11:59  <bobbydroptable> still doesn't necessarily explain why contains() returns true for an element that isn't in it
2011-10-27T04:12:25  <sir_macelon> bobbydroptable: because is uses compareTo and it returns 0
2011-10-27T04:13:05  <Draivin> can't he just make it so that if the two are equal
2011-10-27T04:13:09  <Draivin> compareTo returns -1?
2011-10-27T04:13:43  <sir_macelon> Draivin: no, because it breaks his contract for comparing
2011-10-27T04:13:48  <grom358> well the PriorityQueue fixed it
2011-10-27T04:14:09  <Draivin> contract?
2011-10-27T04:14:28  <sir_macelon> bobbydroptable: take a look at the TreeSet implementation it is backed up by NavigableMap and it overrides the contains method
2011-10-27T04:15:11  <sir_macelon> Draivin: contract is return -1 if one element has lower cost to compared one, the cannot be equal
2011-10-27T04:15:28  <sir_macelon> *they cannot be equal
2011-10-27T04:15:43  <grom358> mmm.. still something wrong with this.. gah
2011-10-27T04:15:54  <Draivin> well, if he returns -1 wouldn't it just be inserted at a lower place in the list?
2011-10-27T04:16:52  <sir_macelon> Draivin: yes, but this a very dirty hack, noone should that
2011-10-27T04:17:07  <sir_macelon> very unintuitive
2011-10-27T04:17:40  <Draivin> Just wanted to know if it would work =p
2011-10-27T04:18:03  <sir_macelon> Draivin: I am not sure if it would work at all
2011-10-27T04:18:19  <grom358> well.. that stopped it getting stuck but its still broken big time
2011-10-27T04:18:35  <sir_macelon> Draivin: how it would work if you would have a set of elements of all the same value?
2011-10-27T04:18:45  <Draivin> well, as I see it, if it is as I see it, it user the compareTo when inserting a new item on the tree right?
2011-10-27T04:19:31  <grom358> http://pastebin.com/Yqw0icft
2011-10-27T04:19:38  <grom358> so.. still don't work :'(
2011-10-27T04:20:03  <Draivin> if it is like that, it would say that this one has a lower value than the previous one, so it would be inserted at a lower index, and therefore be first in the list than their equals
2011-10-27T04:20:11  <Draivin> but when getting the first element from the list
2011-10-27T04:20:24  <Draivin> it doesnt really matter which of the equal distance elements you get first
2011-10-27T04:20:51  <Draivin> you just need them to be after the ones that have a lower distance on the list

2011-10-27T04:33:20  <bobbydroptable> i test with gratuitous amounts of stderr messages... oldskool
2011-10-27T04:33:24  <grom358> gonna be using jUnit soon

2011-10-27T04:34:34  <sir_macelon> grom358: just be sure to design your bot in a way it can be easily unit tested

2011-10-27T04:36:09  <Draivin> that you will ever compare to
2011-10-27T04:36:10  <Draivin> is your parent node
2011-10-27T04:36:14  <grom358> yeah.. i like the version below cause it follows the one on wikipedia
2011-10-27T04:36:16  <Draivin> and it will always be at a smaller distance
2011-10-27T04:36:41  <grom358> just was trying to get my head around the old piece of code I had for this A*
2011-10-27T04:38:45  <grom358> now I can maybe use A* for all my pathing now it fixed.. just not sure about performance doing it that way
2011-10-27T04:39:02  <grom358> I have some wall hugging thing atm that sort of working now
2011-10-27T04:41:06  <bobbydroptable> the code on wikipedia takes into account things like inconsistent heuristics and cost
2011-10-27T04:41:17  <bobbydroptable> for the ants problem , alot of the heuristics can be assumed
2011-10-27T04:41:32  <grom358> what u mean?
2011-10-27T04:41:34  <bobbydroptable> *a lot
2011-10-27T04:41:43  <Draivin> he means that you can only move in four directions
2011-10-27T04:41:44  <Draivin> =p
2011-10-27T04:41:51  <bobbydroptable> well that
2011-10-27T04:41:57  <bobbydroptable> and movement cost is constant
2011-10-27T04:42:05  <grom358> yeah.. I got + 1 in there
2011-10-27T04:42:22  <Draivin> I got +10 so if I want to weight some paths later I can
2011-10-27T04:42:32  <Draivin> without having to work with floats
2011-10-27T04:43:24  <Draivin> how you solved your exploration problem after all bobby?
2011-10-27T04:43:56  <bobbydroptable> part of it was solved with a quadtree
2011-10-27T04:44:30  <Draivin> quad as in quadrants?
2011-10-27T04:44:33  <bobbydroptable> yup

2011-10-27T04:49:26  <bobbydroptable> its only part of the puzzle though, i had to hack the tree quite a bit
2011-10-27T04:51:36  <grom358> so only took 60ms to calculate the path.. sweet
2011-10-27T04:52:31  <Draivin> thats a lot of time
2011-10-27T04:52:45  <Draivin> you have 500ms per turn
2011-10-27T04:53:08  <grom358> i thought its 1000ms per turn
2011-10-27T04:53:16  <Draivin> nop
2011-10-27T04:53:22  <grom358> but u see.. I don't need to A* up every turn either
2011-10-27T04:53:29  <grom358> only if don't have objective
2011-10-27T04:53:38  <Draivin> yeah, but you don't have the whole map upfront either
2011-10-27T04:53:45  <Draivin> as you discover more walls
2011-10-27T04:53:52  <Draivin> how will you do?
2011-10-27T04:54:16  <grom358> yeah.. so I assume I can path to it.. and when I get to water.. I recalculate the path then

2011-10-27T06:07:18  <Draivin> you can just find you ants by location when you receive a "d" with owner 0

2011-10-27T06:08:16  <Draivin> well, I have a ant set with locations as index
2011-10-27T06:08:26  <Draivin> one I receive a ant
2011-10-27T06:08:31  <Draivin> I check if in my ant set
2011-10-27T06:08:34  <Draivin> there is one with that index
2011-10-27T06:08:43  <Draivin> it there is not I create a new ant

2011-10-27T06:12:55  <Draivin> just when you make a move, don't see a big deal in that, better than iterate through you whole array when you want a specific ant I guess
2011-10-27T06:12:59  <ikaros> you could even use simple 2d array since max size of maps is 200*200 and thats few memory
2011-10-27T06:14:18  <bobbydroptable> sigh so difficult to find neighbours in a quadtree
2011-10-27T06:14:19  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-27T06:14:27  <Draivin> yeah
2011-10-27T06:14:32  <Draivin> was going to ask you about that
2011-10-27T06:14:35  <Draivin> I got stuck on that part
2011-10-27T06:14:36  <Draivin> hahaha
2011-10-27T06:14:44  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-27T06:14:52  <bobbydroptable> thinking, or have you alerady done

2011-10-27T06:14:57  <Draivin> thinking
2011-10-27T06:14:59  <ikaros> =)
2011-10-27T06:14:59  <bobbydroptable> cuz that'd make me feel useless
2011-10-27T06:15:01  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-27T06:15:06  <bobbydroptable> i've been coding this for 2 days already
2011-10-27T06:15:08  <bobbydroptable> just this
2011-10-27T06:15:11  <bobbydroptable> =="
2011-10-27T06:15:52  <Draivin> the worst problem
2011-10-27T06:15:58  <Draivin> is that a quad can have multiple neighbours
2011-10-27T06:15:59  <Draivin> on one side
2011-10-27T06:16:13  <bobbydroptable> exactly!!! *cries*
2011-10-27T06:16:26  <bobbydroptable> i have an idea but it puts the UG in UGLY
2011-10-27T06:16:40  <Draivin> what?
2011-10-27T06:17:20  <bobbydroptable> put everything into a 2d array
2011-10-27T06:17:21  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-27T06:17:24  <Draivin> well
2011-10-27T06:17:28  <Draivin> I have another idea
2011-10-27T06:17:31  <bobbydroptable> which is?
2011-10-27T06:17:32  <bobbydroptable> :p
2011-10-27T06:17:57  <Draivin> there could be a search by direction function in the quads
2011-10-27T06:18:05  <mleise> bobbydroptable: pathfinging is fun :D
2011-10-27T06:18:06  <Draivin> so when you want to know the neighbours in a quad
2011-10-27T06:18:15  <Draivin> the top neighbours for example
2011-10-27T06:18:23  <GeorgeJ> Do any of you store your map as layers?
2011-10-27T06:18:33  <Draivin> you would pass 'bottom' to that function
2011-10-27T06:18:40  <Draivin> of the quad that is on top
2011-10-27T06:18:41  <Draivin> the big one
2011-10-27T06:18:47  <Draivin> and it would iterate through the sub quads

2011-10-27T06:19:10  <bobbydroptable> sometimes a neighbour is a branch off a grandparent
2011-10-27T06:19:13  <Draivin> was thinking about that too
2011-10-27T06:19:14  <bobbydroptable> or great grandparent
2011-10-27T06:19:23  <mleise> if i have some pathfinder with nodes, I would make the nodes a separate layer from other data
2011-10-27T06:19:26  <bobbydroptable> you could do a reverse tree lookup
2011-10-27T06:19:49  <nishant> hey guys at the tutorial step 4, on implementing th code , i get duplicate orders when i run the test program
2011-10-27T06:19:52  <Draivin> but you would have to look for every possible neighbour?
2011-10-27T06:19:56  <mleise> GeorgeJ: At least I can say that a single interger for a square is a bad idea
2011-10-27T06:19:57  <Draivin> and filter for duplicates
2011-10-27T06:20:00  <nishant> any suggesions
2011-10-27T06:20:26  <bobbydroptable> sets will do the filtering
2011-10-27T06:20:47  <bobbydroptable> its the lookup that is bothering me at the moment

2011-10-27T06:20:53  <Draivin> yeah
2011-10-27T06:20:56  <Draivin> get every possible neighbour
2011-10-27T06:20:57  <Draivin> is a pain
2011-10-27T06:21:06  <Draivin> that varies with the size of the quad
2011-10-27T06:21:06  <Draivin> haha
2011-10-27T06:21:10  <bobbydroptable> yeh
2011-10-27T06:21:22  <bobbydroptable> but with yours, you'd have to check every node to test that they share edges

2011-10-27T06:26:36  <GeorgeJ> But yeah, not as complex as what you are trying to achieve
2011-10-27T06:27:41  <mleise> GeorgeJ: So you have practically more than a char, too. "Layers" or a single struct.. it comes down to the same in the end.

2011-10-27T06:28:48  <GeorgeJ> There's no point in trying to conserve memory

2011-10-27T06:29:46  <GeorgeJ> Well, tbh. Having stored maps as such, would make it rather easy for the pathfinding algo
2011-10-27T06:29:58  <mleise> When you see 2 enemy parties fight, you can wait till they kill each other for example.
2011-10-27T06:31:44  <GeorgeJ> Using (map[row*cols + col] >> layer) & 0x01 to check if I have an entity would be easier than map[row][col].is_water != 0
2011-10-27T06:32:07  <GeorgeJ> Well, not easier, faster perhaps
2011-10-27T06:33:38  <GeorgeJ> Then have a sepparate structure to keep all data needed by your algos perhaps

2011-10-27T06:51:17  <jix_> it's just a kind of indicator

2011-10-27T07:10:36  <ikaros> i hope there will be some further server updates.. with the current state it's impossible to compare new versions to the field because it takes so long until a solid ranking is available
2011-10-27T07:11:42  <bobbydroptable> tcp servers is your best bet
2011-10-27T07:12:26  <ikaros> yea i use it but the range of opponents alot smaller
2011-10-27T07:12:35  <ikaros> +is
2011-10-27T07:16:56  <bobbydroptable> but you probably get higher calibre opponents too because most people will be doing the same things
2011-10-27T07:16:58  <bobbydroptable> i think
2011-10-27T07:17:05  <bobbydroptable> they'll be the ones with the weird quirky bots

2011-10-27T07:36:18  <nielsrobin> Hi guys, I seem to be slamming my head against the wall here. Did i miss something, or is there no way of telling if a square is seen or unseen?
2011-10-27T07:36:29  <mayanks43> there is
2011-10-27T07:36:36  <mayanks43> unseen squares are marked ?
2011-10-27T07:36:45  <bobbydroptable> nope you have to keep track of them yourself
2011-10-27T07:37:14  <bobbydroptable> on setup, initialise all the squares as unmarked, then go through the vision and mark squares you see as marked
2011-10-27T07:38:00  <nielsrobin> Ok, i'm using the C# version, where, as far as i know there is no "get tile type" on a location. so where does this "?" come into play? in the game state?

2011-10-27T07:38:18  <Draivin> this is just a starting kit
2011-10-27T07:38:25  <Draivin> you should read the documentation
2011-10-27T07:38:27  <jasperduba> look at the code where it reads w for water
2011-10-27T07:38:35  <Draivin> to see what input the server gives to you
2011-10-27T07:38:39  <mayanks43> python starter has visible function
2011-10-27T07:38:41  <Draivin> and parse it properly
2011-10-27T07:38:54  <mayanks43> that does the same as what bobbydroptable said
2011-10-27T07:39:59  <nielsrobin> alright, thanks i'll have a look at the function that keeps track of visible food and see if i can build a "unseen tiles" list using the same method
2011-10-27T07:45:25  <nielsrobin> ok, from looking at the code, it looks like i would have to cycle through every location on the map and figure out if it is seen or unseen by the distance to the nearest ant, does it sound like i'm on the right track?
2011-10-27T07:47:04  <Draivin> you should look at the tutorial
2011-10-27T07:47:08  <Draivin> thats how they do it

2011-10-27T08:04:03  <Garf> because it doesnt specify vision range in the map

2011-10-27T11:02:59  <bearoff_w> is there a situation when you need to calculate more paths than your ants number (if it's not paths cashing)?
2011-10-27T11:03:02  <mleise> I don't know yet how I would handle ants blocking each other or how to assign ants to their targets. It may mean that I want to calculate alternative paths.
2011-10-27T11:04:33  <bearoff_w> you can recalculate blocked ants when it happens
2011-10-27T11:06:10  <mleise> I could well run into timing issues though. Is there anyone with a C++ or C bot that took the time of his path finding algorithm?

2011-10-27T11:22:15  <bearoff_w> if water hapenns, i simply recalculate path in this case

2011-10-27T11:43:08  <nielsrobin> so i'm coding in C# and i seem to run into some performance issues (timeouts at around 400 ants) and i still want to add more complexity to the decision making process. I'm pretty sure that my core issue is not my A*, which seems to run fast enough but rather the input i'm giving it. Eg. lists of foods sorted by distance to the current Ant
2011-10-27T11:44:13  <nielsrobin> Should i be reusing them and not recreating them, should i drop generic lists all together and grab hashtables and hashmaps instead? or is my core problem that i recalculate every search for every ant every turn?
2011-10-27T11:44:50  <nielsrobin> As you can probably guess from my question, i'm not normally engaged in coding where performance is critical
2011-10-27T11:45:21  <bqf> nielsrobin: why are you only "pretty sure" your A* implementation is not your problem? i for one am pretty _damn_ sure C# supports profiling. you should make use of it and find out what is causing your problems ;)

2011-10-27T11:47:45  <nielsrobin> bqf: profiling ok, i'll have a google at that :)

2011-10-27T11:48:29  <antimatroid1> oh wait, might not be a problem

2011-10-27T12:07:33  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: i realise sir macelon might have taken some work to beat, but i imagine the game would have been stopped even if he was about to be taken?

2011-10-27T12:08:15  <McLeopold> yeah, we'd need to add logic that says, "if any bot can gain *or lose* rank, then the game continues"
2011-10-27T12:08:23  <McLeopold> right now we just check for a gain in rank

2011-10-27T12:08:54  <McLeopold> I'm also slightly okay with him having a higher rank than the other too, because he lasted longer

2011-10-27T12:09:14  <antimatroid1> why not call it off before the middle bot got eliminated too then :P
2011-10-27T12:09:16  <McLeopold> There are examples of it being more iffy than that
2011-10-27T12:09:40  <McLeopold> because sir_macelon could have taken out the second and tied
2011-10-27T12:10:08  <antimatroid1> hmm yeah okay, i still think we should be concerned about rankings in general and not just first place in each game
2011-10-27T12:10:19  <antimatroid1> even if our only concern was finding the best bot, which it is not
2011-10-27T12:10:30  <GarfTop> does skill calculations use anything but the top bot?
2011-10-27T12:10:44  <antimatroid1> it uses the ordinal rankings of bots

2011-10-27T12:19:17  <antimatroid1> master_ninja: the point is don't just add all ant locations to one queue and search outwards, i can't remember what exactly but since the euclidean and manhatten metrics aren't equivalent that doesn't work correctly

2011-10-27T12:24:36  <McLeopold> you can add all the ants and search outwards, but when you reach a square that has already been searched, you need to track that furthur distance calcs must be done for both ants

2011-10-27T12:24:48  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: yeah but i can't remember why example wise, my go to example to show the metrics aren't equivalent is

2011-10-27T12:25:05  <antimatroid1> but even if you searched from a first, you could go right and up from b to find *
2011-10-27T12:25:10  <McLeopold> it only appeared starting at distance 7, I believe
2011-10-27T12:25:17  <antimatroid1> ah yeah okay
2011-10-27T12:25:22  <McLeopold> plus, you had to have a speacial offset
2011-10-27T12:25:41  <antimatroid1> yeah, like i said in the forums, the correct faster way is messy
2011-10-27T12:25:57  <McLeopold> you'd end up with a few spots that are visible that you might think are not at the edges of you vision

2011-10-27T12:31:33  <bqf> antimatroid1: i think it's just that when most people hear "coordinates", they automatically think "x, y"
2011-10-27T12:31:49  <antimatroid1> i think location, not coordinate :P
2011-10-27T12:32:31  <antimatroid1> loc and location are shorter than coord and coordinate, so i'm going to claim superiority :P
2011-10-27T12:32:44  <bqf> :)
2011-10-27T12:33:36  <antimatroid1> and i think of the grid as being like a matrix just not over a field to form a ring

2011-10-27T12:34:21  <antimatroid1> shh you :P
2011-10-27T12:34:52  <master_ninja> i'm just using unsigned int location and my "grid" is just single vector
2011-10-27T12:35:16  <antimatroid1> i turned my grid into a graph for pathfinding
2011-10-27T12:35:29  <antimatroid1> no need to calcualte neighbours all the time or check if a location is water
2011-10-27T12:35:42  <master_ninja> brilliant
2011-10-27T12:36:27  <antimatroid1> just add a neighbours vector to each square and remove appropriate neighbours as you receive water inforamtion

2011-10-27T12:38:06  <bqf> antimatroid1: that's what i plan to do. it also solves the wrapping at the borders rather nicely - just connect the edges.
2011-10-27T12:38:08  <antimatroid1> hmmm i wonder how long it would take to calculate for each square the average length of the shortest path to every other square
2011-10-27T12:38:23  <antimatroid1> to give you some idea of which squares had more "escape" paths
2011-10-27T12:38:45  <antimatroid1> i imagine quite a long time unless i'm missing something
2011-10-27T12:39:06  <bqf> antimatroid1: since the official info is that you have "about 1 gig of ram" available for your bot, you could just do this in the background if you have time left
2011-10-27T12:39:09  <antimatroid1> bqf: wrapping is solved by get neighbours or whatever :P

2011-10-27T12:41:06  <antimatroid1> if you're planning a game tree think very carefully about just how ridiculously big the state space is

2011-10-27T12:58:43  <Fluxid> thanks
2011-10-27T12:58:49  <antimatroid1> take two ants that can battle, the first layer is the moves your ant can make, the second layer is the trees your enemy can make then the terminal nodes have the outcome after battle resolution is run, then you need a function to evaluate the states
2011-10-27T12:58:55  <antimatroid1> and that gives you your game tree
2011-10-27T12:59:06  <antimatroid1> moves* your enemy can make
2011-10-27T12:59:30  <Fluxid> but i don't have just one enemy
2011-10-27T13:00:10  <Fluxid> but group of ants, and possibly group of my own ants which may have more killpower when coming closer to enemy

2011-10-27T13:00:38  <antimatroid1> you can either treat it as an nplayer game tree and run backwards induction or treat all enemies as "one player ganging up on you"
2011-10-27T13:00:41  <antimatroid1> i plan to do the later
2011-10-27T13:01:19  <Fluxid> when evaluating possible moves of one ants, can i simplify the case and try four same directions of all my ants, then four directions of all the enemy?
2011-10-27T13:01:26  <antimatroid1> also, i'm considering for a set of my ants that i want to consider moves together with as finding their set of moves, taking out collisions and then having a branch for each of those moves in one layer, rather than having a layer for each ant
2011-10-27T13:02:04  <Fluxid> just ignore the fact that my or enemy ants can move in different directions in next turn
2011-10-27T13:02:22  <antimatroid1> i don't quite get what you mean?
2011-10-27T13:02:43  <antimatroid1> you can do more layers of the tree, but i think you'll be struggling enough already to do moves for you and your enemys 1 turn deep

2011-10-27T13:09:11  <antimatroid1> Fluxid: when i write a game tree, i have a game tree struct with the root node and all functions to get moves etc. and a node struct and each node has a game state and state evaluation function (or maybe that's in state) etc.
2011-10-27T13:10:03  <Fluxid> duh, so this collides with my bot design... i think
2011-10-27T13:10:10  <antimatroid1> :P
2011-10-27T13:10:19  <antimatroid1> always plan your bot before designing everything
2011-10-27T13:10:21  <antimatroid1> otherwise that happens
2011-10-27T13:10:44  <Fluxid> antimatroid1: i have no experience at all
2011-10-27T13:10:53  <Fluxid> i didn;t know what was minmaxing until yesterday
2011-10-27T13:11:04  <antimatroid1> yeah, i had no idea at the start of tron
2011-10-27T13:11:12  <antimatroid1> we all have to learn somewhere
2011-10-27T13:11:37  <Fluxid> still i was surprised that my totally dumb bot which implemented only floodfiling to find directions of ants got to 30 place
2011-10-27T13:11:58  <antimatroid1> it's still very early in the contest
2011-10-27T13:12:28  <Fluxid> more advanced players are coming, huh
2011-10-27T13:12:41  <antimatroid1> if past contests are anything to go by ;)

2011-10-27T13:14:51  <antimatroid1> i'm curious, what do people think of the battle resolution rules?
2011-10-27T13:19:33  <Fluxid> antimatroid1: just to clarify: i have group of four ants ants, each ant can move in four directions. do i try all possible moves of all ants? and then, four enemy ants... this tree would be huge!
2011-10-27T13:20:05  <antimatroid1> each ant has up to 5 moves actually, it can not move if you will
2011-10-27T13:20:11  <Fluxid> even bigger
2011-10-27T13:20:21  <antimatroid1> yes the tree is massive, you need to use less ants or prune the tree somehow
2011-10-27T13:20:58  <antimatroid1> i'm also kind of iffy about how people are managing game trees with this
2011-10-27T13:21:07  <antimatroid1> i had pretty much ruled it out, but it appears people are

2011-10-27T13:34:10  <fenec> how can i find elaborated examples of a bot, my code is a mess
2011-10-27T13:34:16  <cyphase> yea, i glanced through the python starter kit while doing the tutorial, but apart from a few pieces of code that may or may not be eventually changed, i'm doing mine from scratch
2011-10-27T13:35:59  <Fluxid> i made mine from scratch too, and glanced twice at game engine's ants.py (not the one from kit) to see how stuff actually work
2011-10-27T13:37:44  <bishoco> Any word on why the contest game processing is so slow? The current game rate is 1.5 games a minute which tells something is wrong with their servers.
2011-10-27T13:39:26  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=19847 too bad this game ended so early
2011-10-27T13:39:29  <g0llum> there's nothing wrong with the servers, it's just 3 of them against 3000 of us ..

2011-10-27T13:43:20  <zefyear> Just out of interest, is anyone trying an autonomous agents approach as opposed to a top-down managed

2011-10-27T13:46:32  <zefyear> Zannick: For PSO or any other GA to work, you have to have a lot of iterations so you can influence the weights in a markov chain
2011-10-27T13:47:06  <zefyear> If all of your ants 'die out' after each lost game and 'procreate' every won game, you have to lose a lot of games before you can converge to the local optima
2011-10-27T13:47:10  <Zannick> so there are a few things here i should point out
2011-10-27T13:47:47  <Zannick> first, you can't write anything on the contest servers. you have to run your learning or markov algorithm elsewhere
2011-10-27T13:48:20  <Zannick> there are unofficial tcp servers; check the forums or type @tcp
2011-10-27T13:48:22  <zefyear> i noticed
2011-10-27T13:48:32  <zefyear> you can pipe out traffic to the net
2011-10-27T13:48:42  <Zannick> that will get you disqualified
2011-10-27T13:49:00  <Zannick> second, google is not running the contest, only sponsoring it
2011-10-27T13:49:44  <Zannick> all that aichallenge gets from them is money and some publicity
2011-10-27T13:50:17  <Zannick> some googlers might be helping run in their spare time :)

2011-10-27T14:07:32  <magiik> for path finding, passable might be better because some of that stuff is temporary

2011-10-27T14:09:12  <antimatroid1> it's probably easier to just have your bot direct orders onto the food aye?

2011-10-27T14:26:30  <janzert> basically it was allowing a None through as output that it shouldn't have and it was causing later code to choke

2011-10-27T14:27:18  <janzert> by it I mean the language support, not the starter bot itself
2011-10-27T14:27:23  <McLeopold> janzert: I have an idea to speed up games.
2011-10-27T14:27:38  <janzert> yes?
2011-10-27T14:27:49  <McLeopold> I've already created a database field to support the idea a month ago :)
2011-10-27T14:28:19  <McLeopold> Basically, a submission is deactivated after a certain amount of time.  It will no longer be used as a seed, but can still be pulled in for matches.
2011-10-27T14:28:48  <McLeopold> Each user profile page will allow you to reactivate any submission, if you want your current bot to continue to play.
2011-10-27T14:28:51  <janzert> yeah, I'd like to see that
2011-10-27T14:28:58  <avdg> :-)
2011-10-27T14:29:04  <janzert> I was even discussing it with someone else the other day
2011-10-27T14:29:09  <McLeopold> My assumption is that after awhile, starter bots will all start to drop off, and never be pulled into games.
2011-10-27T14:29:19  <janzert> I think the time needs to be at least a week though
2011-10-27T14:29:26  <avdg> (well, lets say you can only activate 1 bot?)
2011-10-27T14:29:28  * janzert nods
2011-10-27T14:29:45  <McLeopold> I was thinking 3-5 days.
2011-10-27T14:29:47  <janzert> avdg: it'll just be your latest
2011-10-27T14:30:17  <McLeopold> on day 7, you'd still be pulled in if you had a serious submission.
2011-10-27T14:30:41  <McLeopold> those that are checking everyday can just click the button to keep it activated
2011-10-27T14:30:52  <janzert> yeah, but I can see it common that people work on their bot once a week. it'd be nice for it to run normally the rest of the week

2011-10-27T14:34:42  <janzert> I'd rather people learn not to do last second uploads :P
2011-10-27T14:35:33  <McLeopold> we could even allow the activate to occur a few hours after submissions are closed
2011-10-27T14:35:51  <janzert> that's probably not going to happen
2011-10-27T14:35:59  <Fluxid> anyway, what will happen after submission are closed?
2011-10-27T14:36:06  *** tncardoso <tncardoso!~thiagon@150.164.2.20> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2011-10-27T14:36:15  <McLeopold> So, if you fractically uploaded a crash bot at the last second, you have a few hours to watch its performance, and then decide to revert to the last submission
2011-10-27T14:36:15  <janzert> it takes me a while to get the finals started and I end up staying up too late that night as it is
2011-10-27T14:36:25  <janzert> adding a few hour delay in would be bad
2011-10-27T14:36:36  <McLeopold> it gives you more time
2011-10-27T14:36:46  <McLeopold> finals start 24 hours after submission deadline
2011-10-27T14:36:56  <janzert> not really
2011-10-27T14:37:09  <McLeopold> they can, we can say the can :)
2011-10-27T14:37:32  <janzert> we're trying to shorten the time between close of submissions and the finals ending not lengthen it :P
2011-10-27T14:37:32  <McLeopold> finals don't need to start right at the deadline
2011-10-27T14:37:40  <McLeopold> why?
2011-10-27T14:37:40  <g0llum> janzert, sorry for the trouble, thanks for the help, works now ;)

2011-10-27T14:38:23  <janzert> half of it was at least mine :)
2011-10-27T14:38:35  <McLeopold> so, why do we need a quick final?
2011-10-27T14:38:38  <janzert> the other half had been there for a very long time, I'm not sure who wrote it
2011-10-27T14:38:51  <janzert> because people start to lose interest
2011-10-27T14:39:04  <janzert> we want to wrap it up fast
2011-10-27T14:39:13  <McLeopold> but, submission are closed? why do we need interest?

2011-10-27T14:40:50  <McLeopold> for the start
2011-10-27T14:40:57  <master_ninja> it would be bad luck if food spawned just next to my any in submission test... i guess i just test my luck for now :P
2011-10-27T14:41:00  <McLeopold> it seems kinda mute for the finals
2011-10-27T14:41:21  <master_ninja> *oops, wrong window
2011-10-27T14:41:25  <McLeopold> master_ninja: no food spawning on submission test for now
2011-10-27T14:41:37  <janzert> if you don't have your final hurrah, you aren't as likely to come back for the next one
2011-10-27T14:42:11  <McLeopold> okay, so, the idea of activating an old bot seems to me a way to lessen the stress load just before finals start
2011-10-27T14:42:32  <McLeopold> less people uploading their best bot, more people just activating their best bot

2011-10-27T14:44:51  <janzert> and I worry a bit about what sort of bugs we are going to run into by reactivating old submissions, seeing as the system hasn't been dealing with that
2011-10-27T14:44:53  <McLeopold> we keep them now, we can discard them later for archiving
2011-10-27T14:45:10  <McLeopold> like trueskill updates or matchmaking?
2011-10-27T14:45:13  <janzert> not really, new workers basically recompile all active submissions all the time anyway

2011-10-27T15:33:19  <Zannick> a lot of bots just go back and forth :/
2011-10-27T15:33:23  <avdg> you have to code much code in other languages as well

2011-10-27T15:34:16  <ajf> avdg: I did
2011-10-27T15:34:23  <Zannick> i don't think we can handle multilanguage bots
2011-10-27T15:34:26  <Zannick> or polyglots
2011-10-27T15:34:48  <janzert> if you want speed and not so low level though Lua might be a way to go
2011-10-27T15:34:57  <avdg> it would probably use multiple threads anyway ;-)
2011-10-27T15:35:20  <avdg> unless its a language in a language
2011-10-27T15:36:05  <master_ninja> It should be possible to submit bots written in assembly language
2011-10-27T15:36:28  <g0llum> the only lua contestant in PW was actually a c  one, supplying compiler and script..
2011-10-27T15:38:36  <Darrow> I think a lot of people prototype in a higher level language (i.e. Python) and then do the final bot in a lower level language once they've optimized everything.
2011-10-27T15:38:58  <Zannick> not necessarily

2011-10-27T15:41:47  <ajf> Darrow: that's how I did it
2011-10-27T15:41:51  <ajf> was not a good idea
2011-10-27T15:42:06  <ajf> in fact, my bad C abilitiy meant it ran SLOWER
2011-10-27T15:42:29  <ajf> Well, CPython has one of the most highly optimized list and hashtable implementations out there
2011-10-27T15:42:49  <ajf> Rewriting your bot in C with your own lists will not end well for performance
2011-10-27T15:42:54  <amstan> ajf: so.. use the cpython list
2011-10-27T15:42:58  <Zannick> some people may just start in a lower level language
2011-10-27T15:43:16  <Zannick> some people might not bother to optimize in the higher language
2011-10-27T15:43:48  <Zannick> or sometimes the optimization in the higher level language is fine
2011-10-27T15:43:50  <avdg> I'm kinda relying that references are cheap
2011-10-27T15:44:01  <avdg> maybe a bad assertion

2011-10-27T17:11:56  <amstan> McLeopold: you have to give it valid json i think
2011-10-27T17:12:04  <McLeopold> amstan: or map text
2011-10-27T17:12:11  <McLeopold> or the live stream

2011-10-27T17:12:35  <McLeopold> so, if the [visualizer] tag could take a map file, that would be nice

2011-10-27T17:37:37  <avdg> or am I confused?
2011-10-27T17:37:46  <overburn> what on earth
2011-10-27T17:37:50  <amstan> Fluxid: load average: 0.39 0.30 0.41
2011-10-27T17:37:56  <overburn> the php starter seems to be useless
2011-10-27T17:37:57  <overburn> O_O
2011-10-27T17:37:58  <ikaros> it's not that important but this page http://aichallenge.org/game_settings.php states turn limit is 1500 but i have the impression it's 1000
2011-10-27T17:38:19  <Fluxid> amstan: that's low!
2011-10-27T17:38:28  <avdg> maybe because its idling?
2011-10-27T17:38:30  <amstan> Fluxid: yeah, i'm not sure why it's not higher
2011-10-27T17:38:44  <amstan> janzert: shouldn't at least one core be at 100%?
2011-10-27T17:39:03  <CIA-24> aichallenge: janzert epsilon * r42e0504 / (setup/chroot_configs/sources.list setup/worker_setup.py): Set chroot package source to ec2 mirror - http://git.io/e-PLeA
2011-10-27T17:39:11  <janzert> amstan: generally it isn't
2011-10-27T17:39:13  <amstan> the python bots seem to only use 20% when working
2011-10-27T17:40:01  <janzert> most bots don't use cpu long enough to push it to 100%, especially the starter bots
2011-10-27T17:40:09  <amstan> ic
2011-10-27T17:40:45  <Fluxid> would it hurt to try running more games at once?
2011-10-27T17:40:46  <janzert> it's why last contest danielvf decided to run 2 bots per core
2011-10-27T17:41:37  <janzert> Fluxid: bots get the short end of the stick if they get stuck running with another high cpu usage bot
2011-10-27T17:41:49  <overburn> so in order to be accepted, does the bot file need to be called MyBot, or does it get recognized automatically?
2011-10-27T17:42:00  <Zannick> has to be MyBot.<extension>
2011-10-27T17:42:11  <overburn> okay thanks mate
2011-10-27T17:42:23  <Fluxid> janzert: ah, i get the problem - timeouts
2011-10-27T17:42:26  <ikaros> 2 bots per core wouldn't be fair with a round timeout i think
2011-10-27T17:42:26  <Zannick> the compiler's not sophisticated enough to find the entry point on its own
2011-10-27T17:42:36  <amstan> janzert: but i don't get it, what the cpu doing for the other time when it's idle
2011-10-27T17:42:56  <janzert> waiting for the engine or other bot
2011-10-27T17:43:24  <amstan> janzert: but if it was waiting for the other bot, shouldn't the other core be at 100%?

2011-10-27T17:44:46  <amstan> but engine is also doing nothing
2011-10-27T17:44:53  <amstan> or only 20%

2011-10-27T18:04:14  <HaraKiri> the maps have different kinds of symmetries, that's confusing. or at least very hard to take use of
2011-10-27T18:04:33  <avdg> HaraKiri: don't rely on the map
2011-10-27T18:04:54  <avdg> it only produces stupid bots
2011-10-27T18:05:03  <HaraKiri> on on those particular maps, but you can use the general information that maps have a symmetry
2011-10-27T18:05:27  <teryret> you know what else produces stupid bots?  A* searches that inexplicably take forever but don't show up on profiler runs...
2011-10-27T18:05:28  <Fluxid> someone here considered using fourier tranformations and other method to predict enemy hives...
2011-10-27T18:06:07  <HaraKiri> if can't see how fourier would help. but hive positions are doable once you know the position of one other hive, and the map symmetry

2011-10-27T18:10:43  <amstan> teryret: you can't rely on that 100%, since your bot is not the only thing executing on the cpu, keep into consideration the operating system
2011-10-27T18:11:06  <amstan> teryret: so make your give up threshold to be much earlier
2011-10-27T18:11:29  <teryret> ... my give up threshhold should be in the first 200 of 1000 ms?
2011-10-27T18:11:36  <teryret> that doesn't sound right
2011-10-27T18:11:46  <amstan> how about 700ms?
2011-10-27T18:11:47  <avdg> the server sets it on 500
2011-10-27T18:11:51  <amstan> oh.. that too
2011-10-27T18:11:52  <amstan> lol
2011-10-27T18:11:54  <amstan> 400ms?
2011-10-27T18:12:13  * avdg is going for 300ms
2011-10-27T18:12:16  <janzert> amstan: more likely is that the bot is doing something for 800ms before checking time_remaining again
2011-10-27T18:12:21  * avdg can't rely his gc
2011-10-27T18:12:23  <teryret> but my problem is that it's showing 800+ms remaining just before it times out
2011-10-27T18:12:28  <janzert> probably stuck in a loop
2011-10-27T18:12:42  <teryret> I thought of that

2011-10-27T18:13:48  <paulwal> Question about the server 'compiler'.  When running interpreted language bots, does the compiler load all *.py  or *.rb files into the interpreter and just load MyBot.extension last, or is MyBot.extension expected to load any extra source files itself?

2011-10-27T18:29:11  <amstan> Zannick: i was trying to do it through contestbot, so it would be temporary

2011-10-27T18:31:25  <amstan> janzert: other languages have it
2011-10-27T18:31:47  <janzert> python compilation isn't like other languages
2011-10-27T18:31:59  <janzert> the ones that is like don't do it
2011-10-27T18:32:07  <ybit> where are the rules for how this game is played?
2011-10-27T18:32:26  <amstan> janzert: i mean other interpreted languages
2011-10-27T18:32:27  <janzert> all python compilation is, is basically pre-parsing the code
2011-10-27T18:32:30  <amstan> yeah
2011-10-27T18:32:43  <amstan> i guess it'll only make like .1s diff at startup
2011-10-27T18:32:48  <McLeopold> janzert: what about food spawn rate, I'd like to increase the start and increase the lower limit
2011-10-27T18:33:16  <ybit> do the ants attack other ants or..?
2011-10-27T18:33:26  <janzert> increasing start doesn't matter either way to me
2011-10-27T18:33:29  <Guest03238> hi! i have a question: i'm trying to build a bot with the python starter package... and as the game swallows all prints i just write debug messages in a file. so if i write a test debug message in do_turn() and run my program it is just written to the file ONCE, while the game has like 117 round or so... anyone has a clue why?
2011-10-27T18:33:32  <teryret> ybit: in addition to the website, the best reference I can give you for how to play is pick up an AI textbook
2011-10-27T18:33:43  <McLeopold> okay, I'll make the change and update the server message
2011-10-27T18:33:51  <janzert> not so sure about lower limit though
2011-10-27T18:33:57  <janzert> what server message?
2011-10-27T18:34:07  <ybit> teryret: i'm looking at the tutorial, but it just mentions avoiding collisions, gathering food, not blocking hills, exploring the map, and attacking enemy hills
2011-10-27T18:34:08  <McLeopold> server_message.html
2011-10-27T18:34:19  <teryret> Guest: the -e and -E flags to the game will make it start logging things you print
2011-10-27T18:34:21  <janzert> why?
2011-10-27T18:34:33  <ybit> if you attack an enemy hill, does that destroy the entire colony automatically or can they then regenerate another hill somewhere
2011-10-27T18:34:33  <McLeopold> uh, because?
2011-10-27T18:34:35  <janzert> it's not something the bot is told at all
2011-10-27T18:34:36  <teryret> ybit: don't look at the tutorial, follow it
2011-10-27T18:34:48  <McLeopold> ture
2011-10-27T18:34:50  <McLeopold> true
2011-10-27T18:34:51  <janzert> just do a forum post, I wouldn't make it a front page thing
2011-10-27T18:34:54  <McLeopold> ok
2011-10-27T18:35:12  <ybit> suggestion: put the rules of how the game is played somewhere so i can read them

2011-10-27T18:36:07  <ybit> i'm on freenode always
2011-10-27T18:36:07  <overburn> umm shouldn't the output from the program be like "x coordX coordy" ?

2011-10-27T18:36:10  <Zannick> did you look at the topic or no?

2011-10-27T18:36:47  <ybit> i did not, my bad

2011-10-27T18:37:14  <Zannick> oh
2011-10-27T18:37:17  <overburn> it outputs things like a 28
2011-10-27T18:37:21  <amstan> Zannick: i don't think so
2011-10-27T18:37:26  <amstan> Zannick: you can compete just fine

2011-10-27T18:38:21  <amstan> Zannick: ok, you should have a disable thing on each profile
2011-10-27T18:38:25  <Zannick> neat
2011-10-27T18:38:49  <amstan> janzert, McLeopold: i think we should display the errors from profiles to admins
2011-10-27T18:38:57  <amstan> the compile errors i mean
2011-10-27T18:39:50  <Zannick> oh, that would be brilliant

2011-10-27T18:54:23  <Zannick> oh, also
2011-10-27T18:54:35  <Zannick> if you're using the print keyword, your bot is outputting to stdout
2011-10-27T18:54:40  <Zannick> which is where your commands should be going
2011-10-27T18:55:03  <Zannick> so they'll be interpreted as invalid commands and your bot will be killed.
2011-10-27T18:55:23  <teryret> it doesn't kill bots on my local box
2011-10-27T18:55:35  <Zannick> or something
2011-10-27T18:55:47  <teryret> it logs them as input errors

2011-10-27T18:56:40  <amstan> yeah! 4 servers now
2011-10-27T18:56:40  <teryret> or perhaps some other type of thing, I know there are strings you can output that will get your bot killed right off

2011-10-27T19:00:06  <Guest03238> it's really weird... if i say my bot in do_turn() to walk to a random location on the map. if i let the program run it ALWAYS picks the same "random" location
2011-10-27T19:00:51  <Minthos> what do you seed your random number generator with?
2011-10-27T19:01:16  <Guest03238> i use the python standard
2011-10-27T19:01:23  <Guest03238> random.randint for row and column
2011-10-27T19:01:29  <teryret> if you're using the script I pasted it seeds random to a constant
2011-10-27T19:01:47  <teryret> (or alternatively if youre using the one from the tutorial, which mine is heavily based on)
2011-10-27T19:01:48  <amstan> Guest03238: starter packages are supposed to use the seed given by the engine
2011-10-27T19:02:47  <teryret> yes, and the engine gets it from a terminal argument
2011-10-27T19:03:03  <Guest03238> i see
2011-10-27T19:03:13  <Guest03238> but if i put nothing it should use the current time, or not?
2011-10-27T19:03:22  <teryret> one way to find out
2011-10-27T19:04:10  <amstan> Guest03238: just remember that having such control to the seed is a useful tool, you can test your bot in exactly the same situation when you have a bug

2011-10-27T19:11:14  <avdg> eduardo_jrh: because the parameters are already set
2011-10-27T19:11:21  <avdg> or wait
2011-10-27T19:11:36  <avdg> hmm so it can't find the maps?
2011-10-27T19:11:49  <avdg> (hmm, I hadn't this problem on mine)
2011-10-27T19:12:41  <eduardo_jrh> wait please
2011-10-27T19:12:41  <avdg> you did not modify the script or added parameters while using it right?
2011-10-27T19:13:25  <eduardo_jrh> i didn't modify anything
2011-10-27T19:13:32  <eduardo_jrh> the example already uses playgame.py

2011-10-27T19:20:48  <eduardo_jrh> Usage: playgame.py [options] map bot1 bot2  You must specify a map file.  Options:   -h, --help            show this help message and exit   -m MAP, --map_file=MAP                         Name of the map file   -t TURNS, --turns=TURNS                         Number of turns in the game   --serial              Run bots in serial, instead of parallel.   --turntime=TURNTIME   Amount of time to give each bot, in milliseconds
2011-10-27T19:20:49  <janzert> hmm, I'm not opposed in principle. I wonder if that percentage might be to low though? I guess we could try it and see.
2011-10-27T19:20:54  <eduardo_jrh> yeah, i'm on lion
2011-10-27T19:21:04  <avdg> ah, that explains a lot

2011-10-27T19:21:24  <eduardo_jrh> it's snow leopard
2011-10-27T19:21:24  <janzert> basically currently you have to have a 10 to 1 ratio currently that would only require outnumbering by 4 to 3

2011-10-27T19:22:57  <avdg> (meh, I'm becoming confused)
2011-10-27T19:22:58  <teryret> although stdout works
2011-10-27T19:23:05  <McLeopold> The cutoff would start a lot sooner, but we give them more time to clean up
2011-10-27T19:23:19  <eduardo_jrh> i must open terminal, the write the address of play_one_game.sh right?
2011-10-27T19:23:31  <janzert> double the clean up time but less than half the advantage
2011-10-27T19:23:34  <avdg> eduardo_jrh: yeah
2011-10-27T19:23:44  <janzert> how about 80% so it's double and half

2011-10-27T20:05:48  <teryret> what we call fog of war is only a visualization of what the ants can currently see
2011-10-27T20:06:19  <teryret> it's important to keep that separate in your mind from the notion of what the computer "knows" at any given time
2011-10-27T20:06:36  <teryret> you can know a great deal more than you can see at any one moment

2011-10-27T20:10:38  <eduardo_jrh> maybe it's a stupid question but i really don't know how to compile the jar file
2011-10-27T20:10:54  <teryret> uh, don't you just run jar files?
2011-10-27T20:11:06  <eduardo_jrh> I tried running it on the Terminal
2011-10-27T20:11:15  <eduardo_jrh> how to compile the .java files on a .jar file?
2011-10-27T20:11:36  <teryret> oh, how to make the jar file you mean
2011-10-27T20:11:52  <eduardo_jrh> sorry, that's what i meant

2011-10-27T20:13:54  <teryret> man jar
2011-10-27T20:14:03  <eduardo_jrh> the tutorial says you should run makefile
2011-10-27T20:14:23  <avdg> meh, js is an easy language to kill performance, but its still a relative fast language when these performance killers are solved
2011-10-27T20:14:26  <teryret> figure out how to do it in the terminal, then use that as the command in your make file
2011-10-27T20:14:26  <eduardo_jrh> what does man jar mean?

2011-10-27T20:14:46  <teryret> go to a terminal, and type "man jar"

2011-10-27T20:15:09  <Mooloo> if you mean running the makefile, you type "make"
2011-10-27T20:15:29  <Mooloo> (the java starter pack comes with a makefile)
2011-10-27T20:15:35  <eduardo_jrh> i type that ont terminal... right?
2011-10-27T20:15:38  <Mooloo> yes
2011-10-27T20:15:49  <teryret> once you have the makefile written
2011-10-27T20:16:03  <dwins> Guest29292929: you don't get a report of anything outside of the visibility radius of your ants
2011-10-27T20:16:25  <teryret> but the first step to getting the make file written is figuring out the command that does the compiling
2011-10-27T20:16:39  <Guest29292929> i see. so i can't plan a path through unseen territorry , right?
2011-10-27T20:16:59  <Mooloo> nothing wrong with planning it :)
2011-10-27T20:17:00  <dwins> well, if you've seen it before you might be able to

2011-10-27T20:17:24  <eduardo_jrh> so i type make... make what? haha what's the target?
2011-10-27T20:17:26  <dwins> but there may be new enemy ants there you don't know about
2011-10-27T20:17:32  <Mooloo> just make
2011-10-27T20:17:33  <Guest29292929> if i call passable() on a cell i haven't seen before
2011-10-27T20:17:37  <Guest29292929> what is the return value?
2011-10-27T20:17:39  <Mooloo> it has a default target
2011-10-27T20:17:51  <eduardo_jrh> it asks me what's the target
2011-10-27T20:17:53  <teryret> the target is defined in the file called Makefile
2011-10-27T20:18:02  <teryret> the default target is all

2011-10-27T20:21:46  <teryret> the function is called visible
2011-10-27T20:22:00  <teryret> you pass it a loc and it will tell you what's there, if it can see it
2011-10-27T20:22:18  <teryret> with some refactoring you can pull a list of all visible spots

2011-10-27T20:54:43  <teryret> when an enemy ant is within your attack radius you fire
2011-10-27T20:55:09  <teryret> and since they have the same radius, when both ants are within that radius of each other they both fire
2011-10-27T20:55:25  <grom358> teryret: yeah that is what I thought.. but why does on the page http://aichallenge.org/specification_battle.php is says Bob attacks Roy
2011-10-27T20:56:16  <callahan> The pictures on the specification  page all need neighborhood circles drawn on them.  Several are unclear about who is within range of whom.
2011-10-27T20:56:53  <Fluxid> hey, similar question but real-life: http://fluxid.pl/misc/2011-10-28-025217_428x346_scrot.png
2011-10-27T20:57:18  <Fluxid> whis is the purple ant killed, and all three green ones survive?
2011-10-27T20:57:30  <Fluxid> none of the three ants are in radius of 5...
2011-10-27T20:57:40  <Fluxid> sqrt(5)
2011-10-27T20:57:49  <callahan> The three  ants are in radius of each other.  Not the enemy.
2011-10-27T20:57:52  <avdg> meh, I still have to wait for a long time to test mine on the site
2011-10-27T20:58:18  <callahan> Because the three green ones each have 3 neighbors (they are within 3 circles).
2011-10-27T20:58:21  <Fluxid> callahan: same, purple isn't in radius of those three
2011-10-27T20:59:40  <teryret> grom358: because bob and ralph are too far apart

2011-10-27T21:03:23  <craklyn> It means that you have to add the code which reads the game's input to your bot

2011-10-27T21:05:52  <craklyn> Depends on the range
2011-10-27T21:05:56  <Fluxid> grom358: my guess is on the time of writing radius was different
2011-10-27T21:06:04  <craklyn> I don't know if they said what the range was in this example, do they?
2011-10-27T21:06:07  <Fluxid> grom358: don't rely on constant value 5
2011-10-27T21:06:10  <teryret> oh, wait a sec, if you just scroll down it gives you how it works in python
2011-10-27T21:06:16  *** RobotCaleb <RobotCaleb!~RobotCale@cpe-70-123-135-189.austin.res.rr.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-27T21:06:20  <callahan> You are counting it wrong.  It's not how many ants surround your enemies that matter.  it's how many ants surround your friends.
2011-10-27T21:06:28  <craklyn> " After moving, Bill has stepped close enough to fight with both red ants while Bob only moved close enough to fight with Roy."
2011-10-27T21:06:40  <craklyn> So yes, by hypothesis, they're in range
2011-10-27T21:06:46  <grom358> yeah I'm not relying on 5.. I just wanted to make sure I understood the radius right.. that my diagram is correct for the correct values
2011-10-27T21:07:49  <callahan> Roy encircles bill and ralph.  ralph encircles roy.  Both roy and ralph have a score of 2 (in two friendly circles).
2011-10-27T21:07:58  <callahan> Same for bob and bill.
2011-10-27T21:08:11  <callahan> Thus bill and roy are in range of each other with same score.  They blow up.
2011-10-27T21:08:18  <craklyn> Friendly circle?
2011-10-27T21:08:27  <callahan> yeah, it counts friends.
2011-10-27T21:08:39  <grom358> what? so you friends don't need to be in range?
2011-10-27T21:08:52  <callahan> Your friends need to be in range of YOU, not your enemy.
2011-10-27T21:10:00  <craklyn> Uh, I don't think my understanding of ant combat agrees with your description callahan
2011-10-27T21:10:05  <grom358> where does it say this?
2011-10-27T21:10:31  <grom358> they talk about how many enemy ants. not friends
2011-10-27T21:10:48  <craklyn> Each ant splits its focus on all enemy ants within its range
2011-10-27T21:10:57  <callahan> (enemies in range of enemy) in the pseudocode
2011-10-27T21:11:01  <craklyn> If an enemy ant within its range has greater focus than your ant has, then your ant dies
2011-10-27T21:11:48  <grom358> yeah.. I see there shape matches mine for attackradius2 = 5.. That is what I was trying to confirm
2011-10-27T21:12:41  <burny> for all ants: count how many of their enemys are in range.. the higher that number is, the easier they are to die, and harder for them to kill
2011-10-27T21:13:00  <burny> if any enemy ant in range, has a smaller number: then it dies
2011-10-27T21:13:45  <Fluxid> okay! time for some tcp testing!
2011-10-27T21:14:00  <callahan> Which bot is yours Fluxid?
2011-10-27T21:14:02  <teryret> tcp?
2011-10-27T21:14:10  <grom358> so.. http://pastebin.com/pcqrWRnT . If if I move to + square then the enemy ant can kill me on their turn.
2011-10-27T21:14:11  <teryret> we're allowed to talk to servers from our ants?
2011-10-27T21:14:26  <Fluxid> NO
2011-10-27T21:14:35  <burny> there is no 'turn'.. all actions are at same time
2011-10-27T21:14:41  <teryret> whew
2011-10-27T21:15:15  <grom358> oh...
2011-10-27T21:15:25  <Fluxid> callahan: it will be fluxid_v5 in a second
2011-10-27T21:15:27  <Fluxid> @tcp
2011-10-27T21:15:28  <contestbot> Fluxid: tcp could be http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto.
2011-10-27T21:15:38  <grom358> so the engine talks to all bots for actions.. then applys them all at same time.. got you
2011-10-27T21:16:23  <callahan> Fluxid: That's a good naming scheme so you can tell your bots apart somewhat.
2011-10-27T21:17:31  <Fluxid> callahan: yes, i'm connecting to tcp few of them at once, so i can check in ranking how they do
2011-10-27T21:18:43  <Fluxid> i hope v5 will work better than v4... at least in close combat because this it the only change
2011-10-27T21:19:08  <Fluxid> v4 just avoids enemy from far, v5 tries to get closer and eventually kill
2011-10-27T21:19:28  <grom358> what is this tcp server u speak of?
2011-10-27T21:20:29  <callahan>  http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto
2011-10-27T21:21:02  <grom358> yeah looked at that.. but what does it do differently to running a game locally?
2011-10-27T21:21:05  <grom358> with playgame.py
2011-10-27T21:21:20  <burny> gives you different opponents
2011-10-27T21:21:46  <callahan> It plays in a tournament against other people's bots.
2011-10-27T21:21:51  <callahan> And ranks them.
2011-10-27T21:21:51  <Fluxid> grom358: it does run it locally
2011-10-27T21:22:02  <Fluxid> but with bots of other people
2011-10-27T21:22:08  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.9705 bah, fail

2011-10-27T21:22:45  <callahan> It's just a separate tournament that isn't so slow.

2011-10-27T21:23:04  <grom358> ah.. okay. My bot not really ready for that
2011-10-27T21:23:14  <grom358> its too stupid atm
2011-10-27T21:23:33  <anty_m> grrr... pathfinding is expensive.
2011-10-27T21:23:34  <grom358> need battle logic.. then it will be ready
2011-10-27T21:23:46  <anty_m> gotta get smarter about storing results between searches
2011-10-27T21:23:48  <grom358> anty_m: do it on queue
2011-10-27T21:23:57  <grom358> that is what I did
2011-10-27T21:24:43  <anty_m> "on queue" ...breadth first search using a queue, you mean?
2011-10-27T21:25:11  <callahan> My bot only does well in random walk maps so far.  But it's really fast.
2011-10-27T21:25:19  <callahan> apply on ants.fluxid.pl
2011-10-27T21:25:33  <grom358> like put that you want to path find onto a queue.. then while timeRemaining > timeToPathfind (pop item off queue; pathfind for item)

2011-10-27T21:37:14  <cyphase> i suppose it's not really, i could just take out the in-dev code and it would run
2011-10-27T21:37:40  <avdg> Fluxid: do you block movements to your own hill?
2011-10-27T21:37:47  <Fluxid> but avdg yes

2011-10-27T21:44:29  <teryret> ok, guesses as to why my bot is making a quarter billion calls to str.lower() ?
2011-10-27T21:44:46  <cyphase> teryret, stuck in parsing?
2011-10-27T21:44:51  <grom358> my current version is using A* to food.. but I could replace it with that snippet again. It worked on my old version of the bot
2011-10-27T21:45:04  <avdg> my only string operations are in a file with 321 loc
2011-10-27T21:45:10  <teryret> nope, somehow str.lower() is being called from my A* code
2011-10-27T21:45:20  <avdg> except debug messages
2011-10-27T21:46:02  <teryret> ... as is file.readline?!?
2011-10-27T21:46:06  <teryret> wtf?
2011-10-27T21:46:10  <cyphase> lol
2011-10-27T21:46:16  <teryret> I didn't write that
2011-10-27T21:46:24  <teryret> I know I didn't
2011-10-27T21:46:38  <grom358> or. like do a hybrid. if can walk directly to it. set that as path.. if none of the food is in direct path.. then choose the closest one by distance and queue up A* for it
2011-10-27T21:47:18  <teryret> if you do A* right it acts like DFS for direct paths
2011-10-27T21:48:09  <teryret> so if it's direct it'll be just as fast as any other algorithm
2011-10-27T21:48:18  <grom358> yeah.. I really should time it for food ones.. the 60ms I spoke about before was to travel across the entire map to enemy hill
2011-10-27T21:48:26  <teryret> (or, more accurately, within a constant factor of any other algorithm)
2011-10-27T21:49:44  <grom358> well.. my current bot.. does BFS limited to the ant's vision. Then picks the first food given by the BFS. Then queues an A* path for it
2011-10-27T21:50:14  <grom358> yeah.. could do that better.. get the BFS to return the path
2011-10-27T21:51:09  <teryret> or just not do the BFS at all
2011-10-27T21:51:21  <teryret> you already have a collection of currently visible foods
2011-10-27T21:51:31  <grom358> yeah but without the BFS how do I figure out the food that is closest?
2011-10-27T21:51:34  <teryret> you can then find the nearest one in linear time
2011-10-27T21:51:49  <teryret> loop over foods calculating distance for each
2011-10-27T21:51:57  <grom358> teryret: how do u know distance?
2011-10-27T21:51:59  <teryret> keeping track of the nearest as you go
2011-10-27T21:52:07  <teryret> there's a function in ants.py that does it for you
2011-10-27T21:52:21  <grom358> closest by vision is not closest by travelling
2011-10-27T21:52:24  <teryret> it's just manhattan distance
2011-10-27T21:52:38  <grom358> yeah.. thats no good. That is why I did BFS
2011-10-27T21:52:44  <grom358> could be water in way
2011-10-27T21:53:12  <teryret> that's very true, but it turns out to not matter
2011-10-27T21:53:42  <teryret> you see the nearest food and start A*ing to it
2011-10-27T21:53:57  <teryret> as you go you're continually checking what the nearest food is
2011-10-27T21:54:00  <grom358> yeah.. but you might head to one that will take longer to get too
2011-10-27T21:54:12  <grom358> that is why I was using BFS
2011-10-27T21:54:22  <grom358> it will give u the closest one
2011-10-27T21:54:34  <teryret> yes, provably optimal and all that

2011-10-27T22:10:46  <Fluxid> as hard as on official. i don't really know how trueskill work

2011-10-27T22:12:38  <TheGeek> any of the contest organizers online?
2011-10-27T22:12:52  <Mooloo> notably mine :) please fix
2011-10-27T22:12:56  <cyphase> how hard would it be to have a reset flag sent when you connect your bot?
2011-10-27T22:13:03  <Fluxid> Mooloo: its python http server behind nginx revproxy...
2011-10-27T22:13:28  <Mooloo> all other pages work, just the replays are apparently just pinted
2011-10-27T22:13:31  <Mooloo> printed
2011-10-27T22:13:39  <Fluxid> Mooloo: gimme a link so i can check
2011-10-27T22:14:28  <Mooloo> ants.fluxid.pl/replay.100
2011-10-27T22:15:00  <Fluxid> link which doesn't work... okay, i'll look into broswer requests >_>
2011-10-27T22:15:23  <Mooloo> i looked at it in wireshark. the response is the replay
2011-10-27T22:15:27  <Mooloo> just no headers at all
2011-10-27T22:16:31  <Fluxid> this exact url doesn't work?
2011-10-27T22:16:58  <Mooloo> yes
2011-10-27T22:18:05  <Fluxid> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/499334/
2011-10-27T22:22:09  <Fluxid> if it doesn't work with your proxy... did you check what proxy  gets or what you get from proxy?

2011-10-27T23:11:43  <Fluxid> and when you find the hill all your ants suddenly reorganize... ungroup
2011-10-27T23:12:17  <rj_> when i check my logs i get invalid orders
2011-10-27T23:12:24  <rj_> can anyone help me here
2011-10-27T23:12:35  <luizribeiro> wow
2011-10-27T23:12:41  <luizribeiro> that is some sick action
2011-10-27T23:12:42  <avdg> did you try to move on water rj_?
2011-10-27T23:12:47  <Fluxid> but i'm happy my stupid bot still can pwn yours somehow D:

2011-10-27T23:13:11  <Fluxid> rj_: food blocks too
2011-10-27T23:13:14  <avdg> rj_: or did you tried to move ants which are not yours?

2011-10-27T23:15:20  <cyphase> i hadn't considered that yet. even without taking advantage of symmetry, you can narrow down where the enemy hill(s) are
2011-10-27T23:15:20  <cyphase> and you know how man there are because it's the same as you
2011-10-27T23:15:20  <cyphase> many*
2011-10-27T23:15:28  <Fluxid> log your movements to stderr
2011-10-27T23:17:02  <rj_> i am just trying to do things from tutorial

2011-10-27T23:40:13  <avdg> meh, many bots are sucking in attacking on open fields
2011-10-27T23:40:21  <Fluxid> i hope in finals turn limit will be 2x or 3x as long
2011-10-27T23:40:39  <Zannick> bots may be more interesting in the finals
2011-10-27T23:40:59  <avdg> just a few running behind, and the team mates in front don't even care about these ants they hunting at
2011-10-27T23:41:03  <burny> hopefully bots will be a lot better by then

2011-10-27T23:56:20  <bobbydroptable> nice
2011-10-27T23:57:37  <avdg> hmm, some bot like to group them self, but are still scared to attack when they are big enough
2011-10-27T23:57:44  <avdg> its actually funny
2011-10-27T23:58:04  <avdg> 1 big group of at least 50 ants, guarded by like 3 ants
2011-10-27T23:58:29  <jsmnsr> is there an ascii visualizer?
2011-10-27T23:58:56  <SharkMonkey> avdg, You can't see the expressions on their faces. You wouldn't want to mess woth those 3 ants either.
2011-10-27T23:59:50  <SharkMonkey> jsmnsr, So you can pretend to be working? :P
