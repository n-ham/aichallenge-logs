2012-09-09T05:56:25  <mcstar> antimatroidl: good evening/morning/afternoon/noon/dawn/dusk or whatever
2012-09-09T05:58:19  <antimatroidl> evening :)
2012-09-09T05:58:55  <antimatroidl> and ridiculously windy
2012-09-09T05:59:22  <mcstar> i like wind
2012-09-09T05:59:34  <mcstar> unfortunately, for 2 days, its me whos windy
2012-09-09T05:59:50  <antimatroidl> up to 95km/h gusts seen recently
2012-09-09T05:59:55  <antimatroidl> got above 110 yesterday
2012-09-09T06:00:10  <mcstar> good for sailing to the New World, isnt it?
2012-09-09T06:00:19  <antimatroidl> 156 up the mountain actually
2012-09-09T06:00:27  <antimatroidl> which is visible from my house
2012-09-09T06:01:05  <mcstar> antimatroidl: do you have a benchmark, like taking the product of 2 diagrams a lots of times?
2012-09-09T06:01:25  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i made a complete program out of what i showed you last time
2012-09-09T06:01:47  <mcstar> and id like to compare it performance wise to yours, since it is slower tham my haskell one considerably
2012-09-09T06:01:52  <mcstar> and id like to know the reason
2012-09-09T06:02:00  <antimatroidl> nope
2012-09-09T06:02:12  <antimatroidl> generate the dictionary from generators
2012-09-09T06:02:24  <antimatroidl> that requires lots of multiplication
2012-09-09T06:02:37  <mcstar> i just want to do it on the same 2 diagrams
2012-09-09T06:03:15  <mcstar> antimatroidl: http://hpaste.org/74446 this is the code
2012-09-09T06:05:10  <antimatroidl> gross :P
2012-09-09T06:05:29  <mcstar> yeah?
2012-09-09T06:05:36  <mcstar> thats means bad?
2012-09-09T06:05:38  <mcstar> -s
2012-09-09T06:05:41  <antimatroidl> no
2012-09-09T06:05:54  <antimatroidl> i think that when i look at other people's code
2012-09-09T06:06:03  <antimatroidl> peoples'*
2012-09-09T06:06:23  <mcstar> i dont understand them either
2012-09-09T06:06:36  <mcstar> c++ usually obscures the logic behind the code
2012-09-09T06:08:28  <mcstar> antimatroidl: have you studied flow networks?
2012-09-09T06:08:45  <mcstar> it is closely related to graph theory, so i thought you might have
2012-09-09T06:09:46  <antimatroidl> my graph theory background is pretty sketchy
2012-09-09T06:09:56  <antimatroidl> we covered flow networks but i didn't take any of it in
2012-09-09T06:10:04  <antimatroidl> i should go through and learn the maths
2012-09-09T06:10:09  <antimatroidl> but there's so much maths to learn
2012-09-09T06:10:13  <antimatroidl> and only a finite amount of time
2012-09-09T06:10:36  <mcstar> minimum cost perfect matching has a solution using the ford-fulkerson algorithm
2012-09-09T06:10:50  <mcstar> but they are presented usually in a primal-dual setting
2012-09-09T06:10:59  <mcstar> which im not familiar with, not even the notation
2012-09-09T06:12:56  <mcstar> antimatroidl: then paste me your diagram code, ill put a 'main' around it, and test it myself
2012-09-09T06:14:36  <antimatroidl> https://gist.github.com/3664627
2012-09-09T06:16:20  <mcstar> stupid github limits the length of the lines
2012-09-09T06:22:58  <antimatroidl> you should be able to get the raw text
2012-09-09T06:24:03  <mcstar> antimatroidl: ofc, im just saying how stupid is that you have to horizontally scroll the read the code from the gist
2012-09-09T06:24:10  <mcstar> to*
2012-09-09T06:24:35  <mcstar> why limit the viewing area?
2012-09-09T06:27:12  <mcstar> antimatroidl: whats A in the Diagram constructor?
2012-09-09T06:30:39  <antimatroidl> the number of nodes connected in an apsis for generators
2012-09-09T06:30:43  <antimatroidl> ie. F_n uses A=3
2012-09-09T06:30:48  <mcstar> i crashed it on the first try...
2012-09-09T06:30:50  <antimatroidl> it's so i can do others later
2012-09-09T06:31:04  <antimatroidl> good effort
2012-09-09T06:31:09  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-09T06:31:33  <antimatroidl> for example if A=3 and N=5 then there's 3 generators 0, 1 and 2
2012-09-09T06:31:57  <mcstar> yeah, and im going for 0 to 100
2012-09-09T06:32:05  <mcstar> and it doesnt take it nicely
2012-09-09T06:32:25  <antimatroidl> yeah i assume people using my code know what they're doing (no exceptions)
2012-09-09T06:32:55  <mcstar> i just put that exception into my code to illustrate the use of it
2012-09-09T06:36:59  <mcstar> ok, so the first 2 examples you gave were, g=0 and g=2
2012-09-09T06:41:43  <mcstar> 8.53s user vs 32.73s user
2012-09-09T06:41:47  <mcstar> antimatroidl: ^^
2012-09-09T06:45:25  <antimatroidl> ?
2012-09-09T06:45:36  <antimatroidl> which one is which?
2012-09-09T06:46:10  <mcstar> mine is the first
2012-09-09T06:46:26  <mcstar> but if im correct, the haskell one is like 10x faster
2012-09-09T06:46:46  <mcstar> but this issue is a bit trickier, with lazyness...
2012-09-09T06:47:11  <mcstar> 1e6 times taking the product of g=0 and g=2
2012-09-09T06:47:52  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i didnt optimize for speed though
2012-09-09T06:48:10  <mcstar> its the simplest working implementation of my thinking i tlaked about
2012-09-09T06:48:43  <antimatroidl> yeah i didn't optimise either
2012-09-09T06:49:04  <antimatroidl> mine is sufficiently fast, but i'll try to speed it up at some point anyway, cause that's what we do :)

2012-09-09T09:34:23  <mcstar> lets do it
2012-09-09T09:48:25  <mcstar> antimatroidl: |G_n| = n-2, right?
2012-09-09T09:49:39  <mcstar> (cardinality of the generator set of order n)
2012-09-09T09:51:34  <antimatroidl> yep
2012-09-09T09:51:39  <antimatroidl> starting from 0
2012-09-09T09:51:46  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-09T09:51:51  <antimatroidl> ie. G_3 = {g_0}
2012-09-09T09:52:10  <mcstar> antimatroidl: so, for n=11, you can have at most 9x9 different products
2012-09-09T09:52:22  <mcstar> of which a lot of will be the same, and the result is 60
2012-09-09T09:52:30  <mcstar> what is 104492 then?
2012-09-09T09:52:44  <antimatroidl> no, i think you misunderstand
2012-09-09T09:52:50  <mcstar> yeah, i think i do
2012-09-09T09:52:54  <antimatroidl> it's not just products, but also products of products
2012-09-09T09:53:00  <antimatroidl> and products of products of products
2012-09-09T09:53:05  <antimatroidl> until you've generated everything possible
2012-09-09T09:53:27  <antimatroidl> ie. what's the dictionary of words using generators
2012-09-09T09:53:30  <mcstar> so you compute G_n^k?
2012-09-09T09:53:43  <mcstar> damn no
2012-09-09T09:53:49  <antimatroidl> yeah i just with min k st G_n^k+1 = G_n^k
2012-09-09T09:53:51  <mcstar> 2^G_n
2012-09-09T09:53:58  <antimatroidl> no
2012-09-09T09:54:01  <antimatroidl> it's not the power set
2012-09-09T09:54:03  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-09T09:54:16  <antimatroidl> what do you is as follows
2012-09-09T09:54:30  <mcstar> afk, got to eat, but pls, write it down
2012-09-09T09:54:41  <antimatroidl> add the generators to the dictionary any new words added to the dictionary including the generators are added to a queue
2012-09-09T09:54:55  <antimatroidl> for each word you take off the queue, multiply it by each of the generators and see if you found a new word
2012-09-09T09:55:33  <antimatroidl> ie. has that diagram been found yet, if it has, just skip over
2012-09-09T10:10:26  <mcstar> antimatroidl: aha, so you want all the diagrams of order n that are closed under multiplication
2012-09-09T10:13:47  <antimatroidl> yes
2012-09-09T10:13:51  <antimatroidl> i want the semigroup generated by them
2012-09-09T10:14:14  <antimatroidl> that's what the semigroup/monoid/group generated by a set of generators is
2012-09-09T10:14:49  <antimatroidl> you can also think of it as the smallest semigroup/monoid/group containing the generators when partially ordered by the subset relation
2012-09-09T10:15:01  <antimatroidl> they're the same thing
2012-09-09T10:17:49  <mcstar> antimatroidl: is G_n minimal, in the sense, that removing any element from it will give a different group?
2012-09-09T10:18:00  <antimatroidl> it's not a grouo
2012-09-09T10:18:04  <antimatroidl> it's not even a monoid
2012-09-09T10:18:11  <antimatroidl> well, F_3 is a monoid
2012-09-09T10:18:12  <mcstar> semigroup
2012-09-09T10:18:25  <antimatroidl> not sure about the middle generators
2012-09-09T10:18:46  <antimatroidl> if you removed the first or last generator you'd obviously just get F_n-1 with a line on one end
2012-09-09T10:18:58  <antimatroidl> and hence a group
2012-09-09T10:19:04  <antimatroidl> but that's not interesting
2012-09-09T10:19:10  <antimatroidl> it's the trivial group
2012-09-09T10:19:26  <antimatroidl> that's F_3
2012-09-09T10:37:44  <mcstar> antimatroidl: did you ever check that G_n x G_n = G_n ?
2012-09-09T10:38:46  <antimatroidl> mcstar: wut?
2012-09-09T10:39:39  <mcstar> i just want to know, if you ever checked that it holds, for the way you generate that set
2012-09-09T10:39:47  <mcstar> fuck
2012-09-09T10:39:50  <mcstar> not G , F
2012-09-09T10:39:59  <mcstar> F_n x F_n = F_n
2012-09-09T10:40:20  <antimatroidl> don't use x
2012-09-09T10:40:24  <antimatroidl> that's for cartesian products
2012-09-09T10:40:33  <mcstar> yeah, on the 2 sets
2012-09-09T10:40:35  <antimatroidl> just F_n^2 or F_nF_n is fine
2012-09-09T10:40:47  <antimatroidl> i don't need to check that
2012-09-09T10:40:59  <antimatroidl> it'd given by the fact that i calculated the semigroup generated
2012-09-09T10:41:00  <mcstar> {a,b} x {c,d} = {a.c,a.d,b.c,b.d}
2012-09-09T10:41:12  <mcstar> where . is what you want it to be
2012-09-09T10:41:42  <mcstar> antimatroidl: im asking, if you actually checked the algorithm
2012-09-09T10:42:01  <mcstar> for some n, at least
2012-09-09T10:42:29  <antimatroidl> {a,b}x{c,d} = {(a,c), (a,d), (b,c), (b,d)}
2012-09-09T10:42:35  <antimatroidl> i don't need to
2012-09-09T10:43:05  <antimatroidl> i have proved the diagrams are no larger than what i have counted up to 319
2012-09-09T10:51:14  <antimatroidl> wooo marking done

2012-09-09T15:59:35  <mcstar> thestinger: for the full problem, ghc runs as fast as the unoptimized c++, with -O3, c++ is 10x faster , all is good again :)
2012-09-09T16:00:01  <thestinger> needs more pgo and lto :P
2012-09-09T16:03:05  <mcstar> thestinger: it needs parallelization
2012-09-09T16:04:03  <thestinger> I wonder if gcc supports c++11 futures yet
2012-09-09T16:07:01  <mcstar> thestinger: in the end this all doesnt matter
2012-09-09T16:07:36  <mcstar> the problem he has is combinatorial, whatever you do, you can only get results for small numbers
2012-09-09T16:08:08  <thestinger> tree-parallelize-loops=2 :P
2012-09-09T16:08:16  <thestinger> -ftree-parallelize-loops=2 *
2012-09-09T16:08:28  <mcstar> whats that>
2012-09-09T16:08:35  <mcstar> and why would that help?
2012-09-09T16:08:39  <thestinger> auto-parallelizes loops
2012-09-09T16:08:48  <mcstar> you cant parallelize something that shares a common resource
2012-09-09T16:08:54  <thestinger> there is? :(
2012-09-09T16:09:00  <mcstar> first you need to get rid of that
2012-09-09T16:09:08  <thestinger> at the very least it would cheat on your benchmark :)
2012-09-09T16:09:11  <mcstar> after that, you can do small tasks in parallel, in synchronize
2012-09-09T16:09:23  <mcstar> in->and
2012-09-09T16:09:48  <thestinger> anyway better to just use tbb
2012-09-09T16:10:02  <mcstar> meaining?
2012-09-09T16:10:06  <mcstar> meaning
2012-09-09T16:10:07  <thestinger> the library
2012-09-09T16:10:27  <mcstar> thestinger: what library?
2012-09-09T16:10:52  <thestinger> tbb.
2012-09-09T16:11:06  <thestinger> intel-tbb
2012-09-09T16:11:20  <mcstar> i recon, tbb stands for something...
2012-09-09T16:11:55  <mcstar> openmp, and mpi is not obsolete either
2012-09-09T16:12:00  <thestinger> thread building blocks (it just has a bunch of concurrent data structures, etc.)
2012-09-09T16:12:08  <thestinger> mcstar: but cilk is way faster
2012-09-09T16:12:20  <mcstar> how?
2012-09-09T16:12:36  <thestinger> it's less stupid
2012-09-09T16:12:41  <mcstar> wait, is cilk that data-graph description stuff?
2012-09-09T16:12:50  <mcstar> from intel also?
2012-09-09T16:13:07  <thestinger> well it's like openmp
2012-09-09T16:14:11  <mcstar> i see
2012-09-09T16:14:24  <mcstar> how do you know it is actually faster?
2012-09-09T16:14:40  <mcstar> im sorry, but i just cant believe that you have actual experience with it
2012-09-09T16:14:49  <thestinger> heh :P
2012-09-09T16:22:01  <mcstar> for n=12, it would take 63 days to run, i better ^c
2012-09-09T16:22:59  <mcstar> but this means, for n=11 antimatroidl run his for more than a week
2012-09-09T16:23:03  <thestinger> do you think there's a better algorithm?
2012-09-09T16:23:15  <mcstar> you can use more brains
2012-09-09T16:23:39  <mcstar> i dont really want to describe the stuff in detail
2012-09-09T16:23:53  <mcstar> but basically, you can exclude stuff, if you study the structure more
2012-09-09T16:24:41  <mcstar> but the result is exponential also, so theres no polynomial algorithm probably
2012-09-09T16:25:18  <mcstar> anyway, it was good to do it, i learned some stuff while doing it

2012-09-09T17:07:17  <mcstar> any news with the contest?
2012-09-09T17:07:22  <McLeopold> nope
2012-09-09T17:07:36  <mcstar> i thought you might have been conspiring in the background..
2012-09-09T17:08:01  <McLeopold> no, I think jeff has just given up, but I don't know
2012-09-09T17:08:14  <mcstar> sometimes ppl ask, and i dont want to disseminate faulty information :)
2012-09-09T17:08:43  <McLeopold> I could probably crank one out it a week or two with the current framework, but we still need money for hosting
2012-09-09T17:09:20  <mcstar> yes, that much we know, you need to get 'organized'
2012-09-09T17:09:30  <mcstar> sry
2012-09-09T17:09:33  <mcstar> incorporated
2012-09-09T17:10:24  <mcstar> deltor was very much on the stand of forking the competition
2012-09-09T17:10:36  <mcstar> but he had moved to switzerland recently, and he hasnt been back since
2012-09-09T17:13:42  <McLeopold> we just need someone willing to take care of the money
2012-09-09T17:14:15  <McLeopold> and maybe a courtesy email to jeff asking for permission to take over
2012-09-09T17:14:58  <McLeopold> mcstar: are you a javascript fan
2012-09-09T17:15:39  <mcstar> i dont speak web technologies
2012-09-09T17:15:58  <McLeopold> so, you wouldn't be interested in this? https://github.com/McLeopold/DCPU16
2012-09-09T17:17:03  <mcstar> dcpu sounds familiar
2012-09-09T17:17:19  <mcstar> is it a simulator of a microprocessor?
2012-09-09T17:17:35  <McLeopold> yeah, for notch's upcoming game
2012-09-09T17:17:54  <mcstar> thestinger: << he will be interesting i think
2012-09-09T17:21:25  <mcstar> McLeopold: lol, Hard science fiction bullet point is lined out :(
2012-09-09T17:21:44  <mcstar> crossed out, that is
2012-09-09T17:22:19  <mcstar> i think when i visited that page last time, it appealed to me, that the game would feature hard scifi
2012-09-09T17:23:07  <mcstar> McLeopold: are you considering this for possible contest material, or you just mentioned it?
2012-09-09T17:24:16  <McLeopold> just mentioned it
2012-09-09T17:24:46  <McLeopold> janzert and I, or maybe jmcarthur discussed an ant game where you get a set of instructions with a cycle cost last year
2012-09-09T17:25:01  <McLeopold> this brings me closer to thinking that is possible
2012-09-09T17:25:38  <McLeopold> mcstar: plus, land the apollo lunar module on the moon with assembler!
2012-09-09T17:27:20  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-09T17:28:08  <mcstar> i dont want to be the grinch, but why would you do that?
2012-09-09T17:28:54  <mcstar> ants was great, you could apply all sorts of strategy, develop algorithms, on which to base them
2012-09-09T17:29:02  <mcstar> it was mildy visual
2012-09-09T17:29:06  <mcstar> mildly*
2012-09-09T17:29:19  <mcstar> it was great
2012-09-09T17:29:34  <McLeopold> the lunar lander is in no way being compared to the aichallenge, totaly separate :)
2012-09-09T17:29:39  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-09T17:29:49  <mcstar> but still, im describing a game that appeals to me
2012-09-09T17:29:57  <jmcarthur> oh hey i was mentioned
2012-09-09T17:30:08  <mcstar> and programming a virtual assemly language isnt for me :)
2012-09-09T17:30:28  <jmcarthur> i would totally write an assembler dsl though!
2012-09-09T17:30:34  <jmcarthur> *edsl
2012-09-09T17:30:39  <McLeopold> in haskell?
2012-09-09T17:30:43  <jmcarthur> hellz yeah
2012-09-09T17:30:44  <mcstar> what else?
2012-09-09T17:30:46  <McLeopold> :)
2012-09-09T17:30:47  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-09T17:30:58  <jmcarthur> okay i should read up i guess
2012-09-09T17:32:28  <jmcarthur> mcstar: "thestinger: for the full problem, ghc runs as fast as the unoptimized c++, with -O3, c++ is 10x faster , all is good again :)" <-- this is just bait for me, isn't it?
2012-09-09T17:32:42  <thestinger> jmcarthur: yes
2012-09-09T17:32:53  <mcstar> jmcarthur: haha
2012-09-09T17:33:21  <mcstar> jmcarthur: it is actually allright, really, the c++ version is highly in-place, and uses a more sophisticated algorithm
2012-09-09T17:33:51  <mcstar> jmcarthur: the haskell one is terser, more comfortable to use...
2012-09-09T17:33:56  <jmcarthur> the in-place-ness is totally doable via haskell without sacrificing purity, to be clear :P
2012-09-09T17:34:19  <mcstar> well, i wrote some stuff in st, it didnt performan too great
2012-09-09T17:34:26  <mcstar> perform*
2012-09-09T17:34:28  <jmcarthur> although depending on the nature of the algorithm i may have to qualify that a lot
2012-09-09T17:34:35  <jmcarthur> i rarely use st
2012-09-09T17:35:34  <jmcarthur> st is pretty lame without unboxing and such, and *usually* you can avoid it without sacrificing performance at all anyway, but that depends on the algorithm.
2012-09-09T17:36:12  <jmcarthur> ah money was discussed earlier
2012-09-09T17:37:05  <jmcarthur> remember i mentioned earlier that i am likely to be able to arrange a sponsor, depending on whether we as a group would want it. it's a more likely deal if the game is trading-related, too.
2012-09-09T17:37:18  <jmcarthur> that's still on the table
2012-09-09T17:37:38  <mcstar> i thought you said you wanted an in-house trading game
2012-09-09T17:37:43  <mcstar> unrealted to aichallenge
2012-09-09T17:37:56  <jmcarthur> we have considered that too, but it's not necessarily a preference
2012-09-09T17:38:11  <jmcarthur> we already have one in-house, if that clears up some confusion
2012-09-09T17:38:42  <jmcarthur> just a simulated exchange and such. not very well implemented or anything though.
2012-09-09T17:38:52  <jmcarthur> and probably not as gamified as it could be
2012-09-09T17:38:55  <mcstar> jmcarthur: so how do you do in-place algorithms, without st, or io?
2012-09-09T17:39:04  <jmcarthur> (for good uses of the word "gamified" rather than stupid ones...)
2012-09-09T17:39:19  <jmcarthur> mcstar: there are various pure apis that internally use mutation, such as vector
2012-09-09T17:39:30  <jmcarthur> it depends on the algorithm, whether that's useful
2012-09-09T17:40:18  <jmcarthur> what is the algorithm? maybe i can nudge in the right direction, if it's doable
2012-09-09T17:40:30  <mcstar> that is semantically equivalent to ST
2012-09-09T17:41:04  <jmcarthur> that's probably overconstraining
2012-09-09T17:41:26  <mcstar> if i reimplemented my c++ one is haskell, i could tell you how much slower it would be
2012-09-09T17:41:27  <jmcarthur> if it's semantically equivalent to ST, it's no better or worse than ST anyway
2012-09-09T17:41:32  <mcstar> but im not going to do that
2012-09-09T17:41:45  <jmcarthur> but what is the algorithm?
2012-09-09T17:41:54  <jmcarthur> the C++ one
2012-09-09T17:42:02  <thestinger> mcstar: just cheat and use pgo.
2012-09-09T17:42:21  <McLeopold> a trading game would require a lot of new framework to be written.
2012-09-09T17:42:28  <jmcarthur> the fact that you guys are saying it is parallelizable strongly indicates that you don't need ST at all
2012-09-09T17:42:33  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: yes
2012-09-09T17:42:44  <mcstar> jmcarthur: no, what i meant is, if you can provide a pure interface for some imperative code, that semantically equivalent to ST, in that you could write that alg. in ST and runST it
2012-09-09T17:42:57  <jmcarthur> sure
2012-09-09T17:43:02  <jmcarthur> it depends on the algorithm
2012-09-09T17:43:11  <jmcarthur> the point is that ST is often overly powerful for what you need to do
2012-09-09T17:43:32  <jmcarthur> there are limited forms of mutation you can get without it
2012-09-09T17:43:38  <mcstar> this is not a well known algorith with a name
2012-09-09T17:43:42  <mcstar> it solved a problem
2012-09-09T17:43:44  <mcstar> solves*
2012-09-09T17:44:02  <mcstar> it is antimatroidl's academic problem
2012-09-09T17:44:26  <jmcarthur> for example, the various "accum" functions in vector give you random-access writes. you just can't read from the accumulation vector until you're done
2012-09-09T17:45:25  <mcstar> jmcarthur: the core algorithm is like, you are given a set of sets
2012-09-09T17:45:51  <mcstar> you have to cluster the set, meaning, take the union of any, that have common elements
2012-09-09T17:46:46  <mcstar> the haskell one uses actual sets, with the usual set operations
2012-09-09T17:47:07  <mcstar> the c++ has a different approach, i dump the elements of a set to a vector
2012-09-09T17:47:32  <mcstar> while dumping a second set to the vector, if i encounter already present elements, i merge the 2 sets
2012-09-09T17:47:34  <mcstar> etc.
2012-09-09T17:47:43  <jmcarthur> so you partition the set into sets of sets that contain one or more common elements and then collapse each set of sets into just a set, resulting in a set of sets?
2012-09-09T17:48:11  <mcstar> if you want to state it in a complicated way, yes
2012-09-09T17:48:18  <mcstar> think of it as set-clustering
2012-09-09T17:48:23  <mcstar> i think that describes it well
2012-09-09T17:48:34  <jmcarthur> i feel like there is more than one way to interpret set clustering
2012-09-09T17:48:43  <jmcarthur> or is that actually well-defined and i should just google it?

2012-09-09T17:51:48  <mcstar> jmcarthur: http://hpaste.org/74494
2012-09-09T17:51:55  <mcstar> if you understand code better :)
2012-09-09T17:52:13  <jmcarthur> code is definitely less ambiguous
2012-09-09T17:52:35  <mcstar> Diagram times(Diagram d1, Diagram d2){
2012-09-09T17:52:45  <mcstar> this is the function, that does the above algorithm
2012-09-09T17:52:59  <mcstar> in the guise of taking a 'product' of 2 diagrams
2012-09-09T17:53:18  <jmcarthur> man i haven't read C++ code in a while
2012-09-09T17:53:26  <jmcarthur> ah
2012-09-09T17:54:33  <mcstar> the real task is then, given a set of generator diagrams, enumerate the semigroup generated by them

2012-09-09T17:57:20  <thestinger> just looking at the valgrind numbers
2012-09-09T17:57:25  <mcstar> the complexity remains the same
2012-09-09T17:57:29  <mcstar> but it is exponential

2012-09-09T17:58:23  <thestinger> so get him to clean it up first :P
2012-09-09T17:58:44  <jmcarthur> i see for loops three levels deep though, which is an indicator of how this works at least...
2012-09-09T17:59:02  <mcstar> jmcarthur: 38-40 is the actual algorithm i was describing
2012-09-09T17:59:07  <jmcarthur> ah, the hs is so much clearer! :)
2012-09-09T17:59:21  <thestinger> different algo though
2012-09-09T17:59:27  <jmcarthur> yeah
2012-09-09T17:59:31  <mcstar> thestinger: go for it, if you can clean it up, what you see there is my professional c++ style
2012-09-09T17:59:41  <thestinger> mcstar: well you can just reduce the copies
2012-09-09T18:00:14  <mcstar> thestinger: copies of what?
2012-09-09T18:02:15  <thestinger> improving the algorithm requires understanding what all these loops are doing first :P
2012-09-09T18:02:26  <mcstar> eh, i think my c++ code is colored according to haskell
2012-09-09T18:02:31  <mcstar> forgot to set the language
2012-09-09T18:02:54  <mcstar> thestinger: ah, copuing of the objects?
2012-09-09T18:03:11  <jmcarthur> the lack of top-level type signatures in the hs hurts my brain :(
2012-09-09T18:03:11  <mcstar> thats quite alright
2012-09-09T18:03:16  <thestinger> yeah they're small
2012-09-09T18:04:17  <mcstar> jmcarthur: theres one... Dequeue is polymorphic in a way that cant be inferred
2012-09-09T18:04:19  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-09T18:04:26  <jmcarthur> :\
2012-09-09T18:04:43  <jmcarthur> actually that surprises me
2012-09-09T18:04:51  <mcstar> oh, and since i made a mistake, i always use main :: IO ()
2012-09-09T18:05:14  <mcstar> jmcarthur: the type selects the type of the dequeue implementation
2012-09-09T18:05:21  <mcstar> it doesnt 'show'

2012-09-09T18:37:29  <jmcarthur> where L is lazy bytestrings
2012-09-09T18:38:28  <jmcarthur> it's 19% faster than wc -l
2012-09-09T18:39:00  <mcstar> hm
2012-09-09T18:39:12  <mcstar> but wc has many options :)
2012-09-09T18:39:34  <jmcarthur> that's true. if i wanted to be really objective i would implement all of them
2012-09-09T18:39:36  <mcstar> jmcarthur: how do you use it?
2012-09-09T18:39:43  <mcstar> cat some | wc
2012-09-09T18:39:46  <mcstar> or direclty?
2012-09-09T18:39:48  <jmcarthur> ./Wc < files
2012-09-09T18:40:07  <jmcarthur> or using cat, but that's an extra command, so i don't know if that affects anything
2012-09-09T18:40:13  <jmcarthur> i guess the shell has to implement <
2012-09-09T18:40:24  <jmcarthur> i built it with -O2 using ghc 7.6
2012-09-09T18:40:29  <mcstar> why not wc -l file ?
2012-09-09T18:40:39  <jmcarthur> i was using more than one file
2012-09-09T18:40:44  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-09T18:40:54  <mcstar> well, < just rebinds file descriptors
2012-09-09T18:40:59  <jmcarthur> ah
2012-09-09T18:41:06  <jmcarthur> even multiple ones?...
2012-09-09T18:41:12  <mcstar> depends on the shell
2012-09-09T18:41:17  <mcstar> zsh is pretty powerful there

2012-09-09T18:44:11  <jmcarthur> that's fair
2012-09-09T18:44:26  * jmcarthur does that
2012-09-09T18:50:20  <mcstar> jmcarthur: do you use graph algorithms at work? like finding maximum flow?
2012-09-09T18:51:08  <jmcarthur> well... i bet the research group does more than i do. i've use some a few times for general cs type stuff, but not for trading specifically

2012-09-09T18:52:09  <jmcarthur> looks like wc was build with -march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, which is the default for arch packages as i understand it
2012-09-09T18:52:12  <jmcarthur> *built
2012-09-09T18:52:41  <mcstar> i forgot you are an archer
2012-09-09T18:52:48  <mcstar> thats good
2012-09-09T18:52:52  <jmcarthur> i did just rebuild it with -march=native -mtune=native instead of the generic ones. could install and try that if you want
2012-09-09T18:53:02  <jmcarthur> ghc doesn't get that same advantage
2012-09-09T18:53:06  <mcstar> me? i dont want anything :)
2012-09-09T18:53:14  <jmcarthur> heh
2012-09-09T18:53:19  <jmcarthur> i'm happy with the generic build
2012-09-09T18:53:23  <jmcarthur> enouh
2012-09-09T18:53:25  <jmcarthur> *enough
2012-09-09T18:53:33  <mcstar> jmcarthur: what do you think is the reason of the difference?
2012-09-09T18:53:54  <jmcarthur> my suspicion is that it's merely a luckier choice of buffer sizes
2012-09-09T18:54:01  <mcstar> yeah
2012-09-09T18:54:02  <jmcarthur> but i have no idea
2012-09-09T18:54:47  <mcstar> jmcarthur: you know what is a much better utility to write? find and/or du
2012-09-09T18:54:52  <jmcarthur> it's all in memory already to begin with since i did these benchmarks with a warm cache
2012-09-09T18:55:01  <jmcarthur> ooh, du might be tough
2012-09-09T18:55:09  <jmcarthur> find would be harder to write
2012-09-09T18:55:15  <mcstar> ive seen some versions of it on a forum
2012-09-09T18:55:30  <mcstar> there was much debate on the canonical form of the solution
2012-09-09T18:55:33  <jmcarthur> du would be an easy one to try and hard to beat, most likely
2012-09-09T18:55:48  <mcstar> i dont think there was a satidfactory solution found though
2012-09-09T18:56:59  <mcstar> jmcarthur: if i had to read the source of utility programs, id choose haskell
2012-09-09T18:57:14  <mcstar> fortunately, it is enough to know the parametrization
2012-09-09T18:57:57  <mcstar> jmcarthur: do you have ocaml+gui experience?
2012-09-09T18:58:23  <jmcarthur> we basically never write guis. the closests we normally get is ncurses
2012-09-09T18:58:28  <jmcarthur> *closest
2012-09-09T18:58:49  <mcstar> in non-work related context?
2012-09-09T18:59:00  <mcstar> or you dont write ocaml outside work?
2012-09-09T18:59:01  <jmcarthur> nah, i don't really do ocaml much outside of work
2012-09-09T18:59:04  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-09T18:59:41  <mcstar> i was eyeballing with f#+qt

2012-09-09T19:01:36  <mcstar> heh
2012-09-09T19:01:40  <mcstar> yeah, me too
2012-09-09T19:02:02  <mcstar> well, qt fits c++ obviously
2012-09-09T19:02:08  <mcstar> the problem, is that c++ doesnt fit me
2012-09-09T19:02:13  <thestinger> jmcarthur: using xul for firefox addons is the one toolkit that doesn't suck
2012-09-09T19:02:28  <thestinger> except javascript makes up in awfulness
2012-09-09T19:02:31  <mcstar> why not write desktops apps in xul?
2012-09-09T19:02:33  <thestinger> makes up for that*
2012-09-09T19:02:39  <mcstar> allegedly it can be done
2012-09-09T19:02:43  <thestinger> mcstar: that's what firefox and thunderbird are
2012-09-09T19:02:49  <thestinger> the UI is all js/xml/css
2012-09-09T19:02:51  <mcstar> yeah, but ppl dont do it
2012-09-09T19:02:56  <mcstar> for other apps
2012-09-09T19:03:00  <thestinger> because xul isn't a stable API
2012-09-09T19:03:09  <thestinger> afaik it has no stable release
2012-09-09T19:03:11  <mcstar> there is one though, filezilla
2012-09-09T19:03:13  <mcstar> i think
2012-09-09T19:03:41  <thestinger> mozilla's internal javascript is much less awful than ecmascript though
2012-09-09T19:03:53  <thestinger> it has lexical scoping, generators, list comprehensions, etc.
2012-09-09T19:04:39  <thestinger> mcstar: maybe, dunno
2012-09-09T19:05:22  <jmcarthur> i expect haskell to be crippled when it comes to du or find because if the idiotic decision to make the default String type a linked list, which of course is what all the posix libraries use
2012-09-09T19:05:27  <jmcarthur> *because of
2012-09-09T19:05:53  <jmcarthur> i would have to bind to various syscalls myself to work around that
2012-09-09T19:06:04  <thestinger> they don't use bytestrings?
2012-09-09T19:06:07  <jmcarthur> not that that's the most horrible thing in the world, but it is pretty dumb
2012-09-09T19:06:12  <jmcarthur> thestinger: not for things like file names
2012-09-09T19:06:27  <jmcarthur> you can use bytestrings for I/O
2012-09-09T19:06:54  <jmcarthur> but the function calls themselves involve the linked-list strings :(
2012-09-09T19:07:36  <jmcarthur> i don't think the impact would be that great, but enough to make it slower than the C implementations, for sure
2012-09-09T19:07:51  <jmcarthur> needless copying, allocations, GC, etc.
2012-09-09T19:08:27  <jmcarthur> without that i bet the gc costs would be basically nothing
2012-09-09T19:12:48  <mcstar> thestinger: not filezilla, but songbird
2012-09-09T19:12:56  <thestinger> oh, yeah
2012-09-09T19:12:59  <mcstar> i think i used it on osx
2012-09-09T19:13:01  <thestinger> I thought songbird was dead though
2012-09-09T19:13:02  <mcstar> awful music player
2012-09-09T19:13:30  <mcstar> thestinger: i wish i had known about console music players, i would have used one of them :(
2012-09-09T19:13:35  <thestinger> mpd!
2012-09-09T19:13:40  <mcstar> cmus!
2012-09-09T19:13:45  <thestinger> or that
2012-09-09T19:13:52  <thestinger> I just leave it on shuffle though
