2010-10-03T00:00:21  <antimatroid2> i've got 11th :(
2010-10-03T00:00:34  <j3camero> aw damn so close
2010-10-03T00:00:50  <j3camero> what is the level of sophistication that is needed to be in the top 100 right now? Top 10?
2010-10-03T00:00:56  <antimatroid2> not that much
2010-10-03T00:00:57  <j3camero> What sorts of algorithms are we talking here?
2010-10-03T00:01:02  <antimatroid2> my current one is still mostly heuristic based
2010-10-03T00:01:18  <antimatroid2> i'm currently working on some kind of approximation to a game tree to try minimax and see how that goes
2010-10-03T00:01:18  <j3camero> Ugh. That is not good. I wonder what we can do to step it up.
2010-10-03T00:01:26  *** yasith_ <yasith_!~yasith@112.135.80.168> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-03T00:01:26  <antimatroid2> but there's so many choices to be made i have no idea how it will go
2010-10-03T00:01:28  <j3camero> That would do it haha.
2010-10-03T00:01:46  <antimatroid2> i tried dynamic programming but too many possibe moves and couldn't see and easy way to reduce that
2010-10-03T00:02:11  <antimatroid2> i think people are going to be using simplex for choice selection at the top towards the end
2010-10-03T00:02:11  <j3camero> I find when I am playing Galcon I am doing a bit of a minimax thing in my head. Trying to figure out how to do the pruning will be tough though. It seems like I base it off of a thousand little heuristics.
2010-10-03T00:02:32  <j3camero> Simplex as in linear programming?
2010-10-03T00:02:38  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-03T00:02:49  <antimatroid2> fairly simple to set it up for moves to planets you want to make
2010-10-03T00:03:22  <j3camero> I can see how you would do it up. Each decision variable is the number of ships to send between each pair of planets, and the constraints are zero and the number of ships available at each planet. However, what would you use as a fitness function?
2010-10-03T00:03:36  <antimatroid2> i don't even mind sharing what my strategies are for this, there are so many and the details are many for each that i don't think it even really matters
2010-10-03T00:04:00  <antimatroid2> not entirely sure yet, Migi32 had an interesting idea
2010-10-03T00:04:07  <j3camero> Do you know what it was?

2010-10-03T00:04:09  <antimatroid2> maximise expected number of ships at the end of the game
2010-10-03T00:04:16  <j3camero> You don't say.
2010-10-03T00:04:38  <antimatroid2> so your ships - their ships + remainingturns(your growth - their growth
2010-10-03T00:04:47  <j3camero> Ahhhh
2010-10-03T00:04:50  <j3camero> Not bad.
2010-10-03T00:05:02  <antimatroid2> i would probably throw something into the mix about position strength
2010-10-03T00:05:11  <j3camero> And that gets maximized for some time period n turns in the future or what?

2010-10-03T00:05:56  <j3camero> Like, you have to pick some time t where you evaluate that heuristic.
2010-10-03T00:05:57  <antimatroid2> yeah, just do it for the end condition if specified, otherwise that one might be a bit wonky
2010-10-03T00:06:11  <antimatroid2> or you could just try to maximise your number of ships 100 turns into the future or something
2010-10-03T00:06:18  <antimatroid2> if the end time is unspecified

2010-10-03T00:07:14  <j3camero> I was thinking that this problem is great for linear programming. I'm just not sure how to choose weights for the maximization function.
2010-10-03T00:07:38  <antimatroid2> that's where it gets difficult
2010-10-03T00:08:11  <antimatroid2> i'm still not sure if the simple way of setting the problem removes the possibility of finding an optimal solution for which no feasible integer solution exists
2010-10-03T00:08:19  <j3camero> It seems like you sort of want to be able to say if(i_own_planet_n,some_linear_function,some_different_linear_function)
2010-10-03T00:08:21  <antimatroid2> i think you can set the constraints up such that that doesn't happen
2010-10-03T00:08:42  <u1tr0n> 7 am ... need to go sleep :(
2010-10-03T00:08:48  <antimatroid2> night
2010-10-03T00:09:05  <u1tr0n> mb in my dream i will see better architecture of my bot ;)
2010-10-03T00:09:21  <j3camero> night ult0n
2010-10-03T00:09:30  *** u1tr0n <u1tr0n!~u1tr0n@90-131-93-178.pool.ukrtel.net> has quit IRC ()
2010-10-03T00:09:51  <j3camero> I think there's always going to be a feassible integer solution. You're always free to do nothing: (0,0,...,0)
2010-10-03T00:10:07  <antimatroid2> yeah, but the planets it spits out to claim as optimal
2010-10-03T00:10:23  <antimatroid2> i am unsure whether it's possible that there is a real solution without an integer solution to that
2010-10-03T00:10:47  <antimatroid2> i think it's fine, but i'm not positive
2010-10-03T00:11:13  <j3camero> The biggest problem is that you sort of need conditionals in the fitness function for the LP, which you can't really do.
2010-10-03T00:11:29  <antimatroid2> whichever way people go algorithm wise, unless it's got a good heuristic side well built into it, it wont do very well this time
2010-10-03T00:11:38  <sigh> yup
2010-10-03T00:11:42  <sigh> at the moment, the quality of the heuristics is the dominating factor
2010-10-03T00:11:44  <j3camero> I was thinking that some kind of interior point algorithm might work even if you had conditionals in the fitness expression?
2010-10-03T00:11:45  <antimatroid2> last time you could do reasonably well with a pretty stragith forward minimax implementation
2010-10-03T00:12:05  <sigh> even later, more sophisticated strategies have to have strong heuristics underlying them
2010-10-03T00:12:27  <sigh> because brute force search is just not feasible for almost any aspect of this problem
2010-10-03T00:12:42  <j3camero> I really really want someone to go hardcore on the machine learning to tune their heuristics. It doesn't seem like we've seen anything like that... yet.
2010-10-03T00:13:02  <antimatroid2> like my idea for minimax is pick some moves from us, them counter that, do that 2 or 3 turns, then estimate their moves with a probability distribution, run each child for a number of turns, evalulate those and run minimax on the tree
2010-10-03T00:13:25  <antimatroid2> still haven't worked out how to pick possible combinations of moves i and they might make with all of that information
2010-10-03T00:13:26  <antimatroid2> it's insane
2010-10-03T00:13:28  <sigh> j3camero: I don't think anyone is at the stage where they know what parameters to use for something like that
2010-10-03T00:13:35  <sigh> maybe they are, but I wouldn't bet on it
2010-10-03T00:13:41  <sigh> people are still figuring this stuff out
2010-10-03T00:13:46  <antimatroid2> i'm playing to let it churn away for a few days at some point trying out different parameter values
2010-10-03T00:14:06  <j3camero> I wonder what I can do to give people a steeper incentive to really create cool stuff.
2010-10-03T00:14:27  <antimatroid2> i have fucked around with parameters manually a lot, but need to get the computer to really give it a go once things are better set up, no point doing it now
2010-10-03T00:14:28  <sigh> let us download the st of  games
2010-10-03T00:14:34  <sigh> or the set of top games
2010-10-03T00:14:36  <antimatroid2> j3camero: prizes :P
2010-10-03T00:14:42  <j3camero> We gotta find some people to do sportscaster-style news coverage of the contest on a daily basis. We could even do Skype interviews with the top contestants and shit.
2010-10-03T00:14:42  <sigh> that too
2010-10-03T00:14:49  <antimatroid2> did that person that emailed you the other day pull through with anything?
2010-10-03T00:15:18  <antimatroid2> j3camero: are we getting a live leaderboard during the final tournament this time? that'd be so much more awesome
2010-10-03T00:15:22  <sigh> j3camero: I think dmj111 is planning to continue blogging about what he's doing
2010-10-03T00:15:28  <j3camero> Yeah he was quite nice. Memberships to his AI website. He hasn't got back to me yet though.
2010-10-03T00:15:28  <antimatroid2> even if not being able to view games
2010-10-03T00:15:48  <antimatroid2> ah, that's not really much of a prize :P
2010-10-03T00:16:10  <antimatroid2> don't get me wrong, i'm competing anyway, but prizes do motivate people
2010-10-03T00:16:25  <j3camero> antimatroid2: no promises, but the odds are higher this time due to open source. I took it down last time because I was so tired of people crying foul, and I knew people would lose their shit every time their ranking moved and blog about how the cotnest is corrupt.
2010-10-03T00:16:38  <sigh> o_O
2010-10-03T00:17:04  <antimatroid2> haters gonna hate regardless
2010-10-03T00:17:13  <j3camero> antimatroid2: yeah, prizes would be so awesome. I wonder if I could put up some prizes...
2010-10-03T00:17:29  <antimatroid2> have you considered an open paypal account?
2010-10-03T00:17:32  <j3camero> antimatroid2: actually, I found that if people couldn't see the leaderboard, they quieted right down.
2010-10-03T00:17:35  <antimatroid2> let people donate for prize money?
2010-10-03T00:17:37  <antimatroid2> i would
2010-10-03T00:18:02  <antimatroid2> j3camero: it's a lot of fun to see the leaderboard evolve throughout the tournament though
2010-10-03T00:18:02  <sigh> j3camero: but you also quieten the people interested in the competition?
2010-10-03T00:18:14  <j3camero> antimatroid2: ohhh this is a great idea. Maybe say that half the donations go to prizes, and half goes to a slush fund for the next contests. We are starting to make big plans that require at least a bit of dough.
2010-10-03T00:18:26  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-03T00:18:28  <sigh> a lot of the chat here revolves around the leaderboard, without it this would be less exciting
2010-10-03T00:18:49  <j3camero> sigh: yeah you're right. This was only during the final tournament after the submission deadline we're talking about.
2010-10-03T00:19:01  <sigh> contestbot tells us the top 10 every hour, and often that sparks a discussion
2010-10-03T00:19:02  <antimatroid2> yeah, but that's when it's most exciting :P
2010-10-03T00:19:02  <contestbot> sigh: I'm sorry Dave, I cannot tells.
2010-10-03T00:19:15  <sigh> :P
2010-10-03T00:19:37  <sigh> I think it will hurt more than help if you hide the leaderboard
2010-10-03T00:19:57  <antimatroid2> if the server could handle people also viewing games, that would be awesome
2010-10-03T00:20:11  <antimatroid2> otherwise maybe pick a few "cool" games each day to release?
2010-10-03T00:20:16  <j3camero> sigh: yeah the odds are higher of the leaderboard staying up for the final tourney this time round, since it's all open source. There is much less chance of people being unreasonable about the ranking algorithm and matching procedure and such.
2010-10-03T00:20:31  <sigh> cool
2010-10-03T00:20:47  <antimatroid2> how long are you planning to run the final tourny for?
2010-10-03T00:20:55  <antimatroid2> i think a week would be awesome with a live leaderboard
2010-10-03T00:21:19  <antimatroid2> and scores need to be reset at the deadline so that everyone starts from scratch, but i think daniel's onto that one
2010-10-03T00:22:01  <j3camero> sigh: the element of surprise was also a factor though. It's cool to embargo it for a while to build up the anticipation. Otherwise it becomes clear who the winner is pretty early. To tell you the truth, we barely needed the final tourney last time. People were being so crazy about making sure that every top50 person played every other top50 person. After all was said and done, it didn't make much difference. The rankings stayed dead steady for the whol
2010-10-03T00:22:31  <antimatroid2> also, for next time, would it be possible for people to specify whether they're happy to share their final code and have their profile automatically have it downloadable after the final tournament should they say they're happy for that to happen? would make it a lot cleaner to find shared code at the end of the contest
2010-10-03T00:22:43  <antimatroid2> google codejam shares everyones code i think
2010-10-03T00:23:09  <antimatroid2> yeah agreed on the rankings
2010-10-03T00:23:20  <antimatroid2> i was one of the people bitching about that a lot, but it really was quite steady
2010-10-03T00:23:26  <j3camero> antimatroid2: yeah I think that's a great idea. People could download the zip file they submitted originally, maybe?
2010-10-03T00:23:36  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-03T00:23:48  <antimatroid2> they're usually pretty small aren't they?
2010-10-03T00:23:52  <antimatroid2> mine is
2010-10-03T00:24:01  <j3camero> for the most part yeah.
2010-10-03T00:24:34  <antimatroid2> i wouldn't force people to have their code shared, might discourage some people from participating
2010-10-03T00:24:41  *** FBP <FBP!~chatzilla@207.160.210.187> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.10/20100914125854])

2010-10-03T00:24:54  <j3camero> We could give people a few options actually: (1) dont release (2) release after the deadline (3) release with a one week delay (4) release with a one hour delay.

2010-10-03T00:26:06  <j3camero> Yeah so today we set up a bunch of workhorse servers on Amazon EC2 to give the bots a bunch more play!
2010-10-03T00:26:14  <sigh> cool :)
2010-10-03T00:26:22  <j3camero> The goal is to get it so newly submitted entries have their rankings converge in under one minute.
2010-10-03T00:26:30  <antimatroid2> that would be awesome
2010-10-03T00:26:42  <j3camero> How long do you find it takes your bot's ranking to converge after submission?
2010-10-03T00:26:50  <antimatroid2> a few hours
2010-10-03T00:26:54  <j3camero> Oh really...
2010-10-03T00:27:06  <antimatroid2> i'm not too fussed with tcp though :P
2010-10-03T00:27:18  <antimatroid2> that was yesterday
2010-10-03T00:27:22  <sigh> my last submission was a week ago
2010-10-03T00:27:30  <j3camero> The TCP model is a good idea I think.
2010-10-03T00:27:32  <sigh> that took a day or so to converge I think
2010-10-03T00:28:01  <j3camero> I am toying with the idea of just letting people run their own bots. They would just connect to a TCP tournament manager. That way if you want to go set your bot up on a bigass cluster you can do that.
2010-10-03T00:28:03  <antimatroid2> sigh: you also lost your first game didn't you?
2010-10-03T00:28:07  <sigh> 2nd :P
2010-10-03T00:28:15  <antimatroid2> j3camero: can't do time limits with that
2010-10-03T00:28:32  <antimatroid2> tcp has to have a high time limit to account of latency
2010-10-03T00:28:32  <j3camero> antimatroid2: why not?
2010-10-03T00:28:45  <antimatroid2> like it's about 5 seconds now i heard
2010-10-03T00:28:57  <sigh> 10 sec first move, 5 second for the rest
2010-10-03T00:29:05  <j3camero> Oh yeah latency. Meh. It's not a big issue. Since we're not actually running people's code, I could care less. Your bot could take 1 minute per turn if it wants.
2010-10-03T00:29:21  <antimatroid2> competition would take ages to run
2010-10-03T00:29:25  <antimatroid2> oh wait no
2010-10-03T00:29:26  <antimatroid2> err :P
2010-10-03T00:29:31  <j3camero> Throughput, my good sir.
2010-10-03T00:29:39  <antimatroid2> yeah okay, so just remove time limits?
2010-10-03T00:29:45  <j3camero> We could run thousands of games concurrently.
2010-10-03T00:30:07  <antimatroid2> you could set some time limit to remove absurdness
2010-10-03T00:30:16  <j3camero> Yeah we could just remove time limits, or else have one hour time limits or some such.
2010-10-03T00:30:28  <antimatroid2> i'd say like 30 seconds or a minute
2010-10-03T00:30:43  <antimatroid2> otherwise the opponent gets stuck in that game for AGES
2010-10-03T00:30:52  <sigh> absurd time limits is no good I think
2010-10-03T00:30:57  <sigh> you get less games :(
2010-10-03T00:31:05  <antimatroid2> sigh: not really
2010-10-03T00:31:10  <antimatroid2> cause you are always playing someone
2010-10-03T00:31:13  <j3camero> The average use case will be less than one second per turn. It would only be the pwoer users who take ridiculous amounts of time. Since it doesn't hurt the contest, that's fine. They would udnerstand that the tradeoff is that you get less games in.
2010-10-03T00:31:19  <antimatroid2> as opposed to waiting for the server to be able to play you
2010-10-03T00:31:22  <sigh> if it's a minute per moves, then potentially you only start a new game every hour or two
2010-10-03T00:31:29  <sigh> *minute per move
2010-10-03T00:31:41  <antimatroid2> 10 seconds then
2010-10-03T00:31:45  <sigh> assuming that one bot can only play one game at a time
2010-10-03T00:31:56  <antimatroid2> allows people using "lesser" languages to not bitch
2010-10-03T00:32:10  <j3camero> Oh, I guess the issue is if you take such a long time that your opponent forfeits by shutting down his bot. Didn't think of that. So we would need some kind of time limit, like 10 seconds.
2010-10-03T00:32:17  <antimatroid2> although, you might then have lots more timeouts from people with crap connections
2010-10-03T00:32:19  <sigh> I think the current timeout on tcp is reasonable
2010-10-03T00:32:23  <antimatroid2> so anyone with a good connection has an advantage?
2010-10-03T00:32:36  <j3camero> Yeah.
2010-10-03T00:32:54  <antimatroid2> dear uni, may i please have a port opened, no fuck off
2010-10-03T00:32:57  <j3camero> Hardware fairness goes out the window if we let people run their own bots. Someone can go run it on a cluster if they want.
2010-10-03T00:33:03  <sigh> but, overall I think tcp is awesome for an informal tournament and testing, but not very fair at all
2010-10-03T00:33:30  <antimatroid2> yeah, i think it's better to keep the final tournament on similar machines with similar time limits
2010-10-03T00:33:40  <antimatroid2> donations :P
2010-10-03T00:33:42  <j3camero> I think it's a minimal issue, honestly. If the internet is fast enough to play FPS, then latency doesn't matter.
2010-10-03T00:34:20  <antimatroid2> do there exist places still on dial up?
2010-10-03T00:34:35  <antimatroid2> can you play fps games on dial up?
2010-10-03T00:34:40  <antimatroid2> i have no idea for these things
2010-10-03T00:34:42  <j3camero> Yes. But it's unlikely that anyone who would give us grief about latency is using dial up.
2010-10-03T00:35:30  <sigh> but yeah, not everyone can get on tcp
2010-10-03T00:35:57  <antimatroid2> yep, a lot of people keep timing out and just give up
2010-10-03T00:36:28  <sigh> I kept timing out, but that got fixed when I moved my comp from wireless to wired
2010-10-03T00:36:37  <sigh> but moving to wired was very annoying for me
2010-10-03T00:36:48  <j3camero> 2% of people looking at the web page are on dialup.
2010-10-03T00:37:09  <antimatroid2> isn't it ideal for the competition to be open for everyone?
2010-10-03T00:37:28  <antimatroid2> what about the ability to upload your submission and have it run by you?
2010-10-03T00:37:34  <antimatroid2> or run it locally
2010-10-03T00:37:40  <antimatroid2> so people could upload if they insist
2010-10-03T00:37:46  <j3camero> Yeah I thought of that.
2010-10-03T00:37:49  <antimatroid2> that way you'd have less to deal with
2010-10-03T00:38:22  <j3camero> Or keep it the way it is, but have an option to connect by TCP for the power users. So if anyone wants to bitch about hardware fairness, I give them the connection details and tell them to rent a cluster.
2010-10-03T00:38:55  <antimatroid2> that's an option
2010-10-03T00:39:08  <antimatroid2> i personally think it's better to have them all submitted
2010-10-03T00:40:00  <sigh> ^^ I second that
2010-10-03T00:40:49  <sigh> I rather this be about who writes the best algorithm, than who can get the best hardware and connection
2010-10-03T00:42:16  *** keynes <keynes!~AndChat@203.236.22.68> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2010-10-03T00:42:17  <j3camero> Hardware hackers are hackers too haha.
2010-10-03T00:42:40  <sigh> :P
2010-10-03T00:42:41  <j3camero> Of course, if you sample the people who are already taking part (who are all software hackers) then they would prefer hosted bots.  :-)
2010-10-03T00:43:48  <j3camero> I wonder if we could do some really intense shit where we let top bots have more resources. I wonder if people who like that. I would love to see some people experimenting with parallel algorithms and stuff.
2010-10-03T00:44:12  <antimatroid2> i'd like to see some games with more planets if possible?
2010-10-03T00:44:20  <antimatroid2> my bot can handle variable planets
2010-10-03T00:44:25  <antimatroid2> i assume most people can
2010-10-03T00:45:00  <j3camero> Yeah we should write a different map generator. The one we have sucks balls. I wrote it on the bus one day just to have maps to test the engine on.
2010-10-03T00:45:11  <sigh> some purposely degenerate maps would be interesting
2010-10-03T00:45:35  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-03T00:45:37  <sigh> for example, a regular pattern
2010-10-03T00:45:52  <j3camero> Cool idea. I should generate some maps that have three-way symetry, with only two of the sides occupied by players to begin with. It would be a fight for control of the remaining side.
2010-10-03T00:45:53  <antimatroid2> or perfect circles etc.
2010-10-03T00:46:10  <Sylph> that'd be interesting
2010-10-03T00:46:10  <antimatroid2> j3camero: that's a really good idea
2010-10-03T00:46:12  <sigh> or to be evil, hexagonally packed planets at a distance of 1 unit :)
2010-10-03T00:46:19  <Sylph> start making interesting maps, like starshaped, etc
2010-10-03T00:46:24  <Sylph> circle, square
2010-10-03T00:46:26  <sigh> stealth fight :)
2010-10-03T00:46:27  <Sylph> square with an X
2010-10-03T00:46:29  <antimatroid2> yes, or do a square lattice of planets distances 1 apart
2010-10-03T00:46:29  <j3camero> Oh snap that would be interesting. I like the honeycomb map idea.
2010-10-03T00:46:39  <Sylph> lol
2010-10-03T00:46:41  <antimatroid2> i really want that now
2010-10-03T00:46:45  <Sylph> that can be crazy at 1 unit ?
2010-10-03T00:46:47  <j3camero> Or the square lattice.
2010-10-03T00:46:47  <Sylph> how many planets ? :|
2010-10-03T00:46:52  <Sylph> my bot will die :|
2010-10-03T00:46:56  <antimatroid2> you never see enemy fleets sent from planets distanced 1 apart
2010-10-03T00:47:02  <Sylph> yeah >.<
2010-10-03T00:47:04  <j3camero> Oh shit yeah if they're one unit apart then it would be intense.
2010-10-03T00:47:23  <j3camero> That's a totally different ball game.
2010-10-03T00:47:33  <antimatroid2> how hard is it for you to add a map?
2010-10-03T00:47:38  <j3camero> Easy.
2010-10-03T00:47:45  <j3camero> Give me the map, I will add it.
2010-10-03T00:47:52  <antimatroid2> does it have to have 23 planets?
2010-10-03T00:47:57  <j3camero> No
2010-10-03T00:48:01  <j3camero> Just a text file.
2010-10-03T00:48:04  <antimatroid2> okay, i'ma make some
2010-10-03T00:48:08  <j3camero> Yup.
2010-10-03T00:48:16  <sigh> cool :)
2010-10-03T00:48:28  <j3camero> Is anyone here a fan of hard glitch music?
2010-10-03T00:48:33  <Sylph> don't go crazy with number of planets :|
2010-10-03T00:48:58  <antimatroid2> i wont
2010-10-03T00:49:09  <antimatroid2> i'll try to keep it below 30
2010-10-03T00:49:13  <antimatroid2> i WILL*
2010-10-03T00:49:13  <Sylph> ah ok
2010-10-03T00:49:15  <Sylph> that's good
2010-10-03T00:49:18  <j3camero> the square lattice degenerates into a much simpler game.
2010-10-03T00:49:25  <Sylph> i was like worried you put in 100-200 planets :|
2010-10-03T00:49:41  <Sylph> that when i got my bot working, it'd just choke >.<
2010-10-03T00:49:42  <sigh> j3camero: that's assuming all planets are equal
2010-10-03T00:49:45  <Sylph> get
2010-10-03T00:49:48  <sigh> more to the game than distance
2010-10-03T00:49:51  <j3camero> it's basically like a chess board where you stack black or white chips on each square.
2010-10-03T00:50:27  <antimatroid2> hmm, if i do a c++ function to output to a file on windows, is the normal endl going to go fine on the servers?
2010-10-03T00:50:39  <j3camero> No, but I'll fix it.
2010-10-03T00:50:42  <antimatroid2> i have to edit maps with notepad++ for the save to not fuck it up
2010-10-03T00:50:43  <antimatroid2> okay
2010-10-03T00:51:33  <j3camero> Crazy thing about the square lattice is that you can actually still go diagonally if you want.
2010-10-03T00:51:46  <sigh> you can go anywhere
2010-10-03T00:51:49  <j3camero> It only makes sense to do so over longer distances, but you can do it.
2010-10-03T00:52:12  <sigh> why only over longer distances?
2010-10-03T00:52:33  <sigh> hopping from planet to planet is always slower than direct
2010-10-03T00:52:41  <j3camero> Oh man. People here should check out "Is You" by D.I.M. Make sure you get the original mix, not the dumb remixes. It's glorious coding music.
2010-10-03T00:53:36  <j3camero> The distance is ceil(x*x+y*y). You would almost never want to jump diagonally by one square, when you could go two sides around the square. Takes the same number of turns, but also gives you the option of turning around.
2010-10-03T00:53:44  <antimatroid2> this will be done soonish, what kind of lattice ones do you want?
2010-10-03T00:53:52  <antimatroid2> i will do circular ones going out from the middle after
2010-10-03T00:54:04  <sigh> j3camero: hopping reduces hte number of units available
2010-10-03T00:54:04  <antimatroid2> with whatever density for each circle
2010-10-03T00:54:13  <sigh> becuase of the order that the engine handles things
2010-10-03T00:54:14  <antimatroid2> i will do 5x5 lattices? 25 planets?
2010-10-03T00:54:24  <antimatroid2> 1 distance apart? want any other distances apart?
2010-10-03T00:55:01  <sigh> if you go A -> B -> C then B gets stuck with G(A)+G(B) units
2010-10-03T00:55:07  <sigh> where G(x) is growth of planet x
2010-10-03T00:55:39  <sigh> whereas if A and B both go direct to C then B only gets stuck with G(B) units
2010-10-03T00:55:55  <sigh> it's because you make orders before you process growth and arrivals
2010-10-03T00:56:01  <antimatroid2> where do you want starting positions? top left and bottom right?
2010-10-03T00:56:56  <sigh> antimatroid2: it shouldn't matter
2010-10-03T00:57:12  <antimatroid2> yeah, so which do i pick :P
2010-10-03T00:57:25  <sigh> flip a coin
2010-10-03T00:58:51  <contestbot> Top 10 players: ruilov(3903), davidjliu(3853), Hazard(3817), rsergio(3769), felixcoto(3736), EBraun(3723), cfaftw(3711), dmj111(3711), bix0r4ever(3659), sequoh(3648)
2010-10-03T00:59:25  <sigh> j3camero: simpler way to explain it - hopping takes an extra turn :P so diagonal is also faster
2010-10-03T00:59:46  <j3camero> yup
2010-10-03T00:59:47  <antimatroid2> diagonal is two moves
2010-10-03T00:59:55  <antimatroid2> hoping is just as fast
2010-10-03T00:59:58  <j3camero> I was assuming that all the planet start empty.
2010-10-03T01:00:14  <antimatroid2> so you can to left then right or diagonally in the same number of turns
2010-10-03T01:00:20  <sigh> antimatroid2: the travel time is 2 moves, but you are stuck on middle planet for a move
2010-10-03T01:00:36  <antimatroid2> you can move there
2010-10-03T01:00:36  <antimatroid2> on the middle turn
2010-10-03T01:00:51  <sigh> you can't, you issue order -> then arrivals come -> then execute order
2010-10-03T01:00:59  <sigh> you can't use the incoming arrivals in your order
2010-10-03T01:01:16  <antimatroid2> yeah you move left, next turn that arrives and you own that planet, so you then move to the diagonal planet
2010-10-03T01:01:17  <sigh> jut like you can't use the growth
2010-10-03T01:01:20  <antimatroid2> total trip length is 2 turns
2010-10-03T01:01:28  <antimatroid2> you don't get growth for that claim though
2010-10-03T01:01:33  <antimatroid2> on that turn
2010-10-03T01:01:50  <antimatroid2> what kind of growth and ships?
2010-10-03T01:02:02  <sigh> random
2010-10-03T01:02:06  <j3camero> okay imma play some fucking galcon now. I can't take it any more.
2010-10-03T01:02:16  <sigh> heh
2010-10-03T01:02:18  <antimatroid2> i was thinking it'd be cool to have it constant across at least all neutral
2010-10-03T01:02:31  <sigh> try both
2010-10-03T01:02:37  <antimatroid2> okay
2010-10-03T01:02:47  <sigh> my worry is that constant might be a trivial stalemate
2010-10-03T01:02:59  <antimatroid2> yeah okay
2010-10-03T01:03:17  <antimatroid2> i have the necessary function in my bot already anyway
2010-10-03T01:04:41  <sigh> necessary function?
2010-10-03T01:05:12  <j3camero> def win_now();
2010-10-03T01:06:40  <antimatroid2> pick a number for me between x and y
2010-10-03T01:06:54  <j3camero> z?
2010-10-03T01:07:09  <sigh> x+eplison
2010-10-03T01:07:29  <sigh> *epsilon
2010-10-03T01:07:35  <j3camero> z*x+(1-z)*y, 0<=z<=1?
2010-10-03T01:09:26  <sigh> McLeopold's wormbot is a good idea of what happens if you hop: http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=McLeopold.WormBot.py
2010-10-03T01:09:36  <sigh> units get "stuck" on the intermediate planets
2010-10-03T01:09:55  <sigh> not sure about the effect on travel time anymore

2010-10-03T01:22:44  <rwa> took me awhile to understand what the point of planet hopping was
2010-10-03T01:23:08  <rwa> at first it seemed really dumb, but a lot of the good bots did it...
2010-10-03T01:23:14  <sigh> I understand the point, just a matter of whether the delay is worth it
2010-10-03T01:23:23  <rwa> sigh: yes.
2010-10-03T01:23:25  <sigh> a lot f good bots also go direct
2010-10-03T01:23:55  <rwa> there are good times to go direct and good times to hop.  Also, it depends on what bot you're playing...
2010-10-03T01:24:01  <sigh> :)
2010-10-03T01:24:29  <sigh> then there's stuff like everyone hop staging planets

2010-10-03T01:25:31  <sigh> ok, I've decided I was wrong... in the lattice case hopping doesn't perform worse than direct

2010-10-03T01:37:09  <sigh> nah, j3camero said he was interested in the idea of some designed maps
2010-10-03T01:38:11  <rwa> hmm, contestant designed maps?
2010-10-03T01:38:27  <askhader> Why not?
2010-10-03T01:38:59  <rwa> because you could tailor them to what your bot is good at
2010-10-03T01:39:21  <rwa> if you had a special trick for a certain configuration, put that all over the place...
2010-10-03T01:39:31  <sigh> rwa: not that in that way, just in the sense of some non-random maps
2010-10-03T01:40:05  <sigh> such as lattices, regular arrangements, etc
2010-10-03T01:41:31  <sigh> anyway, the point was about having some maps that were specifically designed to be "interesting"
2010-10-03T01:41:41  <rwa> don't think that's a good idea either.  perhaps somebody worked out one of those cases ahead of time, and then gets to submit it as an official map.  not fair.

2010-10-03T02:15:23  <antimatroid2> this is still ranomly picking nuetral ship sizes and growth rates

2010-10-03T02:17:41  <antimatroid2> i couldn't get it to output the coordinates as actual double values :|
2010-10-03T02:19:28  <rwa> I'm stuck around 30 at the moment.  My last 5 or 6 ideas haven't panned out very much.
2010-10-03T02:20:18  <antimatroid2> http://codepad.org/5VyYR4hY
2010-10-03T02:20:21  <antimatroid2> 6x6 map
2010-10-03T02:21:15  <antimatroid2> http://codepad.org/DLeYSPZF that's the better generator too, other one was picking starting locations only in top left 2x2 block for all dimensions
2010-10-03T02:30:48  <sigh> antimatroid2: you need to prefix the lines with a P
2010-10-03T02:31:35  <sigh> rwa: yeah, I'm having the same problem
2010-10-03T02:31:55  <rwa> you're stuck considerably higher than me, though...
2010-10-03T02:32:17  <antimatroid2> that would possibly explain my issues :P
2010-10-03T02:33:35  <antimatroid2> h'okay, http://codepad.org/GV3F4XLE, sorry about the spam, use that map generator then the files work
2010-10-03T02:33:42  <sigh> rwa: not much difference, I am closer to you than say dmj111
2010-10-03T02:35:23  <sigh> only ~100 elo points
2010-10-03T02:35:32  <antimatroid2> oh wait, i have one more desired fix :P
2010-10-03T02:37:58  <antimatroid2> http://codepad.org/TYUySfEO final copy of generator :)
2010-10-03T02:38:30  <antimatroid2> i'm curious how bots would go against each other on it
2010-10-03T02:39:56  <antimatroid2> hmmm, i think we could do a map where all planets are distances one apart from the others?
2010-10-03T02:40:04  <antimatroid2> just put all planets in a ball of radius 1?
2010-10-03T02:40:07  <antimatroid2> that would be interesting
2010-10-03T02:41:18  <antimatroid2> that's an awesome idea aha
2010-10-03T02:43:50  <antimatroid2> my bot can handle a 10x10 map still fairly fast
2010-10-03T02:44:01  <antimatroid2> and i got a winner in 92 turns
2010-10-03T02:44:14  <antimatroid2> i think we could maybe do much larger maps and not have the turns necessarily blow out so much

2010-10-03T02:49:10  <antimatroid2> what size do you want?
2010-10-03T02:49:17  <antimatroid2> i am just testing 13x13 but it's pretty slow
2010-10-03T02:49:22  <sigh> paste the one you thought was most interesting
2010-10-03T02:49:25  <antimatroid2> still less than 1 second per move though
2010-10-03T02:49:32  <antimatroid2> i've just been replacing them as i go :P

2010-10-03T02:58:35  <antimatroid2> my bots seems to expand lots on these and then whoever gets the biggest half wins
2010-10-03T02:58:41  <antimatroid2> are you getting that if you have run them?

2010-10-03T03:00:36  <antimatroid2> sigh: how bad does it look on canvas visualiser? they look fine on the old one :P
2010-10-03T03:00:55  <sigh> the distance 4 one looks fine
2010-10-03T03:01:10  <antimatroid2> i was going to do this one just on a straight line, but then the way i think it displays it, would be better to do it as a circle with certain density of points
2010-10-03T03:01:27  <antimatroid2> i'll just do the line one first and see what happens
2010-10-03T03:03:09  <sigh> antimatroid2: sending you screenshot of distance 1
2010-10-03T03:03:26  <antimatroid2> yep, if it starts :P cheers
2010-10-03T03:03:28  <sigh> ignore the green numbers, that's just something I added

2010-10-03T03:05:20  <sigh> the green numbers are just me displaying the planet ids
2010-10-03T03:06:50  <sigh> anyway, no big deal... easy enough to fix the visualiser if I need to
2010-10-03T03:07:50  <antimatroid2> so what happens play wise?
2010-10-03T03:09:01  <sigh> my bots expand towards each other and one wipes the other out :P

2010-10-03T03:17:52  <antimatroid2> i'll try those two being the only two planets 2 apart
2010-10-03T03:25:36  <antimatroid2> nah, those games are very boring
2010-10-03T03:31:42  <antimatroid2> okay, i think 50 planets could probably be done, anything above that and maybe not

2010-10-03T03:36:35  <antimatroid2> http://codepad.org/zeDPrDqF you can generate your own lattice map on that page, just edit the distance and dimension variables in main at the bottom and click run

2010-10-03T09:35:22  <u1tr0n> no but you can debug on TCP server
2010-10-03T09:37:51  <Florian> Arf
2010-10-03T09:38:00  <Florian> "Florian95 crashed / did not start / timeout."
2010-10-03T09:38:04  <Florian> is not very explicite
2010-10-03T09:38:05  <Florian> .. :(
2010-10-03T09:38:37  <u1tr0n> you count time in debug ?
2010-10-03T09:39:22  <Florian> for timeout ?
2010-10-03T09:39:32  <u1tr0n> yep
2010-10-03T09:39:34  <Florian> no

2010-10-03T09:39:55  <Florian> all match
2010-10-03T09:40:03  <u1tr0n> try to count on tcp server in first step you have 10 sec on public only 1
2010-10-03T09:40:35  <Florian> its works before :(

2010-10-03T10:05:03  <Florian> ok...
2010-10-03T10:05:15  <Florian> u1tr0n, its because my bt work on 1.8 but not 1.9
2010-10-03T10:05:31  <Florian> ruturaj1 -> what do you want, your first match determine your infos
2010-10-03T10:06:19  <ruturaj1> ohk! so the first username and password will define my credentials.
2010-10-03T10:06:55  <Florian> yes
2010-10-03T10:07:02  <ruturaj1> Also, is it known, whether planet IDs are from 0 to sizeof(pw.Planets()) only?
2010-10-03T10:07:27  <ruturaj1> or can there be k planets and an ID be > K+1
2010-10-03T10:10:41  <Arekku> naw
2010-10-03T10:10:48  <Arekku> ids start from 0
2010-10-03T10:10:59  <Arekku> and go to sizeof(pw.Planets())-1
2010-10-03T10:14:06  <ruturaj1> And I hope that remains constant across the game. I am getting "issued invalid command" always, and I am not able to get the tools running either .. the tcp server matches are also not running.
2010-10-03T10:14:38  <Florian> make some test before send a command
2010-10-03T10:14:41  <Florian> num of ships....
2010-10-03T10:15:01  <Florian> if source.num_ships > sended_ships && sended_ships > 0
2010-10-03T10:15:03  <Florian> ...
2010-10-03T10:15:40  <ruturaj1> Yes, I am keeping them, I feel the mapping from Planets to IDs is going wrong.
2010-10-03T10:16:07  <ruturaj1> more like, will pw.Planets()[0] have planetID 0? no right?
2010-10-03T10:16:15  <Arekku> yep
2010-10-03T10:16:38  <ruturaj1> yep for.. it will be 0?
2010-10-03T10:16:44  <Arekku> it'll be 0
2010-10-03T10:20:37  <Arekku> might be the wrong place to ask
2010-10-03T10:20:57  <Arekku> but does anyone have any hints how I could get a job in programming without any experience?
2010-10-03T10:21:30  <ruturaj1> experience as in professional work experience or programming experience?
2010-10-03T10:22:15  <Migi32> Arekku, you mean no provable experience
2010-10-03T10:22:17  <Migi32> ?
2010-10-03T10:22:23  <Arekku> no proffesional experience
2010-10-03T10:22:38  <Arekku> got fornicating loads of hobby experience
2010-10-03T10:22:58  <Migi32> yes that. What did you study at college/university?
2010-10-03T10:23:43  <Arekku> Malardalen University, which has not been added yet
2010-10-03T10:23:53  <Arekku> sorry robotics, misread you
2010-10-03T10:24:19  <ruturaj1> Arekku: Professional experience is not required for your first job. You can directly apply to companies. mostly from their website like www.company.org/careers
2010-10-03T10:24:29  <ruturaj1> you can know if positions are open and you can apply.
2010-10-03T10:27:05  <Migi32> if all jobs required experience, nobody would have a job :)
2010-10-03T10:29:49  <Arekku> Problem being there always seem to be someone with more experience applying, oh well I'll just keep trying then

2010-10-03T11:22:13  <optimum> i'm thinking i'm not going to win either.  the competition must be fierce, and the problem requires real intelligence

2010-10-03T11:24:02  <Arekku> oh right, well are you planning to rank high?
2010-10-03T11:24:06  <mcmillen> i'm fairly sure i won't win either :) i'll be super happy if i'm in the top 100

2010-10-03T11:34:37  <Arekku> wow that was interesting
2010-10-03T11:34:43  <optimum> google really needs to work on supporting niche browsers

2010-10-03T11:36:10  <mcmillen> i was winning slightly, but i was winning earlier and then the other guy came back

2010-10-03T12:31:28  <Agamemnus> hello, i'd like to ask how we could go about having a starter package for my programming language, Freebasic
2010-10-03T12:33:33  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: basically you have to provide tested instructions for setting up the prerequisties on the server and probably write your own starter since it's a low demand language
2010-10-03T12:34:11  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: you don't necessarily have to provide a starter for others to use though. you can just follow the spec and make a bot without a ready-made starter if you'd rather
2010-10-03T12:34:42  <jmcarthur> i don't know how quickly the admins are adopting new languages though
2010-10-03T12:35:07  <Agamemnus> i see
2010-10-03T12:35:51  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: if you can test and provide instructions for setting up Freebasic on the server as well as compilation and execution instructions (preferably in the form of a patch to the compile script and stuff) then you can probably get it in. it just takes a little upfront work is all

2010-10-03T12:37:43  <antimatroid2> no, you put your source files into a zip, then the server compiles them itself

2010-10-03T12:39:11  <antimatroid2> oh wait, you're haskell aren't you?
2010-10-03T12:39:11  <jmcarthur> requires GHC 7 for at all resonable performance
2010-10-03T12:39:15  <antimatroid2> yeah
2010-10-03T12:39:16  <Agamemnus> ok... so i send data to the server by printing the data (stdout), but stdin? I'm not really familiar with this...
2010-10-03T12:39:20  <jmcarthur> server only have GHC 6.8.2
2010-10-03T12:39:22  <jmcarthur> *has
2010-10-03T12:39:59  <antimatroid2> Agamemnus: it's basically taking in a string containing information about the game state, you take that and choose which moves you want and print that back to the engine
2010-10-03T12:40:35  <Agamemnus> so the program goes into a wait loop and waits for the server to send it data?
2010-10-03T12:40:56  <antimatroid2> i guess, you have 1 second for each move, otherwise you lose
2010-10-03T12:41:03  <jmcarthur> yeah, it's basically receive game state then send orders, repeatedly
2010-10-03T12:41:42  <Agamemnus> :\ I am not sure how to do this in Freebasic without using the actual stolen C commands :-|
2010-10-03T12:41:50  <dwchandler> Agamemnus: read from stdin until you see a line with "go", then calculate your moves, print out the moves and end with "go"
2010-10-03T12:41:55  <Agamemnus> (freebasic can include headers like "crt.bi")
2010-10-03T12:42:04  <Agamemnus> i see
2010-10-03T12:42:19  <Agamemnus> well it sounds easy enough, though i am not 100% sure how to make the wait loop
2010-10-03T12:42:25  <dwchandler> surely freebasic has the ability
2010-10-03T12:42:31  <jmcarthur> antimatroid2: GHC 6.8.2 is... workable... but i'd have to rewrite from scratch. i'm using some GHC 7 specific stuff because i am going for C-like performance. if i can't get that with haskell i'll probably have to just drop to C
2010-10-03T12:42:51  <Agamemnus> ok, so let's see...
2010-10-03T12:43:24  <antimatroid2> i'm just using c++, although i intend to learn haskell at some point and will probably convert to being a little fanboy of that
2010-10-03T12:43:32  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-10-03T12:43:42  <antimatroid2> i'm a maths student and people say that should follow quite well
2010-10-03T12:43:52  <dwchandler> yes
2010-10-03T12:44:11  <Agamemnus> well, freebasic doesn't really need any instructions besides just... copying the freebasic files and doing "<fbc> <file>"
2010-10-03T12:44:22  <dwchandler> some bits will feel just like home to a maths student, but not everything ;-)

2010-10-03T12:44:29  <jmcarthur> yeah with haskell you can kind of forget a lot of things about evaluation order and just think of your problem as a set of math equations
2010-10-03T12:44:53  <Agamemnus> and where would I post this?
2010-10-03T12:45:19  <jmcarthur> @where issues
2010-10-03T12:45:19  <contestbot> jmcarthur: issues = http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/list
2010-10-03T12:45:49  <jmcarthur> best to put instructions for installation there, and include a patch for the compilation script and the code that runs the bots
2010-10-03T12:46:31  <Agamemnus> uh.... code that runs the bots? you mean like a test?
2010-10-03T12:46:42  <jmcarthur> i mean like in the tournament manager
2010-10-03T12:46:47  <jmcarthur> the site and backend are open source
2010-10-03T12:47:31  <Agamemnus> would they accept just installation instructions?
2010-10-03T12:47:43  <Agamemnus> I can't really be bothered to try to run a server and test it atm.
2010-10-03T12:48:04  <jmcarthur> if you are really careful with the coding you can just submit an untested patch
2010-10-03T12:48:14  <jmcarthur> somebody should review it before merging anyway

2010-10-03T12:50:16  <jmcarthur> h/o
2010-10-03T12:50:46  <Agamemnus> i mean like... say I have the Freebasic Linux program. (Linux, right?)
2010-10-03T12:51:07  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: here is the compilation script: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/compile_anything.py
2010-10-03T12:51:08  <Agamemnus> I have set up freebasic on a linux server before, and all I have to do is just copy the files
2010-10-03T12:51:16  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: the runner is in the same project somewhere, but i don't know where
2010-10-03T12:51:41  <jmcarthur> copy the files where?
2010-10-03T12:52:07  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: you have to provide instructions for installing Freebasic on Ubuntu Server 8.04, 32 bit
2010-10-03T12:52:14  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: and it's best if Freebasic is in the package manager
2010-10-03T12:52:34  <Agamemnus> i copy the files to one of my server directories.. doesn't really matter
2010-10-03T12:52:43  <jmcarthur> what files are you talking about?
2010-10-03T12:52:58  <Agamemnus> freebasic exe and include files
2010-10-03T12:53:01  <jmcarthur> oh
2010-10-03T12:53:05  <jmcarthur> eh, that would not be ideal
2010-10-03T12:53:17  <jmcarthur> the admins won't like running some binary from a stranger on the internet
2010-10-03T12:53:38  <jmcarthur> it would be better to get it through from the freebasic project proper
2010-10-03T12:53:44  <jmcarthur> *get it from
2010-10-03T12:53:53  <jmcarthur> or through the ubuntu package manager
2010-10-03T12:53:53  <Agamemnus> yeah, i will put a link to the linux freebasic compiled version
2010-10-03T12:53:59  <Agamemnus> never used that..
2010-10-03T12:54:01  <jmcarthur> the package manager would be ideal

2010-10-03T12:54:35  <Agamemnus> ok, so do you know anything about http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/compile_anything.py ?
2010-10-03T12:54:37  <jmcarthur> i would recommend setting up a VM with ubuntu server 8.04 32bit and testing your installation instructions
2010-10-03T12:54:54  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: for compile_anything you should be able to just model your additional code on one of the other languages
2010-10-03T12:55:07  <jmcarthur> there's a big switch statement in there
2010-10-03T12:55:19  <jmcarthur> the compile_function function
2010-10-03T12:55:20  <Agamemnus> i'm thinking C, since Freebasic is very similar to it
2010-10-03T12:55:22  <mcmillen> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=322684 has some directions on how to compile freebasic on ubuntu (old)
2010-10-03T12:56:00  <Agamemnus> a linux compiled version wouldn't work, would it? :(
2010-10-03T12:56:40  <Agamemnus> (i am a total noob at compiles and makefiles and such)
2010-10-03T12:57:02  <Agamemnus> so i dunno if what i just said makes any sense
2010-10-03T12:57:45  <jmcarthur> Agamemnus: the admins will want to set it up themselves, not use something that somebody else prepared on their behalf. the server is rather security critical after all
2010-10-03T12:58:02  <jmcarthur> so you will have to provide detailed instructions how
2010-10-03T12:58:06  <Agamemnus> it doesn't look like i can do this myself, so i will post what we need in the freebasic forums
2010-10-03T12:58:11  <jmcarthur> and they can't just be "copy my files into these locations"
2010-10-03T12:58:31  <Agamemnus> so, a patch to the makefile, instructions to compile freebasic to ubuntu server 8.04,
2010-10-03T12:58:40  <jmcarthur> what makefile?
2010-10-03T12:58:41  <Agamemnus> and optionally a test program
2010-10-03T12:58:44  <Agamemnus> errrr the py file
2010-10-03T12:58:46  <jmcarthur> no, not a test program
2010-10-03T12:58:47  <Agamemnus> not makefile

2010-10-03T12:59:09  <Agamemnus> optionally, a....???
2010-10-03T12:59:14  <jmcarthur> you need to patch compile_anything, you need to patch whatever script runs the bot, and you need to submit some installation instructions
2010-10-03T12:59:20  <jmcarthur> none of that is really optional
2010-10-03T12:59:51  <jmcarthur> i don't remember which script actually launches the bot. you'll have to just find it yourself
2010-10-03T12:59:58  <Agamemnus> ok, thanks
2010-10-03T12:59:58  <jmcarthur> or ask somebody else (anyone?)
2010-10-03T13:00:20  <jmcarthur> maybe it's the engine that does it
2010-10-03T13:00:23  <jmcarthur> dunno
2010-10-03T13:00:28  <Agamemnus> It's ok
2010-10-03T13:02:10  <Agamemnus> so just to be clear, these instructions are to compile freebasic, or to set it up from the compiled linux version?
2010-10-03T13:02:22  <Agamemnus> i'm not really clear whether ubuntu code is the same as linux code

2010-10-03T13:15:01  <jmcarthur> aga|afk: these instruction are to set it up on ubuntu however is idiomatic for setting up freebasic on ubuntu. i don't know exactly what that is though. you will need to ask the freebasic guys, most likely

2010-10-03T16:35:18  <optimum> i am considering strategy... basically, i think i should create some kind of rank function that determines which planet to take over next based on factors such as size, proximity to other planets, the enemy's locations, and so forth
2010-10-03T16:35:43  <optimum> then there's the question as to how much force to use

2010-10-03T16:45:32  <tty2> optimum, no doubt, typically something like this would use a deterministic weighted model with a non-deterministic AI discovering the weights of the model

2010-10-03T17:38:22  <tty2> Migi32, id be happy to
2010-10-03T17:38:54  <Migi32> well it'd basically be a minimax search, but with the following difference:
2010-10-03T17:39:17  *** JensTi1 <JensTi1!~jens@109.236.131.176> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-03T17:39:21  *** JensTi <JensTi!~jens@109.236.131.176> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-10-03T17:39:40  <Migi32> if you do minimax the original way, you basically let players take turns, allowing one to react on moves by the other he couldn't possibly know yet
2010-10-03T17:40:54  <Migi32> so instead I would consider each node of the minimax search tree as a zero-sum game and find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium on it, and use that to get the "score" of that node
2010-10-03T17:41:17  <tty2> Migi32, interesting approach
2010-10-03T17:41:25  <tty2> Migi32, bonus points for creativity
2010-10-03T17:41:39  <tty2> Migi32, i cant say ive ever applied that approach before, although ive worked with minimax
2010-10-03T17:41:46  <Arekku> does it work well in reality?
2010-10-03T17:42:12  <Migi32> yeah, but the other problem is that the number of branches is insane and finding a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium requires solving a linear programming problem
2010-10-03T17:42:40  <Migi32> for which I'd use the simplex algorithm which has exponential complexity...
2010-10-03T17:42:44  <tty2> Migi32, i tend to be a big supporter of creative ways of mixing and matching AI (my own library i mentioned is specificallygeared towards bewing able to intermix unrelated AI strategies seemlessly)... so i suspect that it has the potential to be very effective
2010-10-03T17:43:35  <tty2> Migi32, it will be challenging, but you seem to have a good grip on how to do it
2010-10-03T17:43:36  <Migi32> so to limit the number of branches, I would only branch if the move (one "move" can consist of multiple orders) is an attack that the enemy can't possibly hold or if it's sending reinforcements to defend, and this move wasn't possible on a previous turn (as then we have already branched).
2010-10-03T17:43:45  <Migi32> but I see 2 major problems with that:
2010-10-03T17:43:55  <Migi32> 1. there are still an enormous number of branches left, because there are usually a ton of possible ways to partition where you get your attacking ships from
2010-10-03T17:44:05  <Migi32> 2. it totally ignores positioning of ships, planets in a corner won't move their ships to a more favorable position

2010-10-03T17:46:02  <Arekku> still sounds a lot better than my strategy though m8
2010-10-03T17:46:06  <tty2> Migi32, well thats one of the things that is appealing about this challenge... like chess, you cant run through every single possible outcome, there are just too many. So if your going to use a search algorithm you need to come up with a creative way to not search every branch (DFS type algorithms here would be fairly useless id imagine)
2010-10-03T17:46:38  <tty2> Arekku, if it is implementable... there are some unique challenges to his approach which need to be addressed firs t:)
2010-10-03T17:47:55  <Migi32> well yeah, the most annoying that there's really a mind-boggling number of possible moves each turn
2010-10-03T17:48:06  <Migi32> chess has about 35 per turn
2010-10-03T17:48:12  <Migi32> Arimaa 17000
2010-10-03T17:48:27  <Migi32> this game a 1 with about 20 zero's I guess :P
2010-10-03T17:48:35  <Migi32> at least in mid-game
2010-10-03T17:48:50  <tty2> Migi32, yea, per turn maybe, but the overall number of possiblities of turns as a whole are still enourmous.. but yes here the possiblities per turn, rahter than as a whole, makes it even more challenging
2010-10-03T17:49:24  <tty2> Migi32, which is why i think this challenge will very certainly need some non-deterministic AI to be approached properly (any approach that goes through all the possiblities just has too large a search space)
2010-10-03T17:50:42  <Appleman1234> isn't it best to just do dimension reduction on the search space ?
2010-10-03T17:51:50  <tty2> Appleman1234, maybe, if you can effectivly. But i suspect even if you do youll either still have a very large search space, or youll have thrown out vital information.

2010-10-03T18:00:17  <Migi32> I'm sorry, I won't say it in this public channel ;)
2010-10-03T18:00:44  <tty2> Migi32, by the way keep in mind there are unsupervised neural networks to consider too, like SOM, which can help determine features as well
2010-10-03T18:00:55  <tty2> Migi32, so you may not need to train at all
2010-10-03T18:01:09  <Migi32> SOM stands for?
2010-10-03T18:01:21  <tty2> Migi32, if youd like to pm it to me you can, but, considering i might help other groups as well you should do so cautiously
2010-10-03T18:01:34  <tty2> Migi32, Self Organizing Map, it is synonomous with Kohonen networks
2010-10-03T18:01:35  <Migi32> but I have a question to other people: can you still download the played games from the server like you could in the Tron contest?
2010-10-03T18:03:17  <tty2> Migi32, if you go with ANN or SOM you may want to consider the open source AI library i mentioned only because it implements both of them... there are other libraries as well, dANN ( #dANN on here ) is theone i write, and there is Neuroph, another good open source AI library that is specific to neural networks (dANN is more for AI in general and goes beyond just neural networks)
2010-10-03T18:03:29  <tty2> let me link the dANN library page incase anywhere here might find it useful
2010-10-03T18:03:55  <tty2> http://wiki.syncleus.com/index.php/DANN that has a bullet point list of all the features in dANN

2010-10-03T18:08:23  <antimatroid2> you guys have too much time on your hands :|
2010-10-03T18:08:31  <antimatroid2> i want time to do lots of machine learning stuff :(
2010-10-03T18:09:18  <tty2> antimatroid2, i love machine learning, fun stuff... if i had more time on my hands i might enter the contest, but i wotn cause id much rather just tinker at making good AI library than to win at a game (which is why im glad i atleast get to help people here with the AI parts)
2010-10-03T18:10:02  <mcmillen> btw, i just posted http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=854 which is a basic but non-hacky approach to deciding what to do on your first turn
2010-10-03T18:10:38  <antimatroid2> i've started the ground work for an approximation to a game tree

2010-10-03T18:19:00  <Migi32> can we use this dANN library? Is it installed on the server?
2010-10-03T18:19:10  <tty2> by the way for your consideration... this game has the markov property.
2010-10-03T18:19:33  <Arekku> great, found another thing to patch :(
2010-10-03T18:20:12  <tty2> Migi32, dANN is an open-source library. if you wish to use it you can just package the library with your source code id imagine. and me, or anyone in #dANN could help with that side of it. But i dont know exactly whats on the AI server itself.
2010-10-03T18:20:15  <antimatroid2> tty2: had thought of that, still buttloads to work with
2010-10-03T18:20:53  <Migi32> yea I already ditched the variables that track where a fleet came from or what its total trip length was
2010-10-03T18:21:46  <tty2> Migi32, :)
2010-10-03T18:22:07  <Migi32> tty2, unfortunately there's a 2MB limit to the (zip-compressed) source we can upload
2010-10-03T18:22:17  <Migi32> how big is dANN's source compressed?
2010-10-03T18:22:55  <Arekku> about this big <---------------------------------------------------------> (not to scale)
2010-10-03T18:22:56  <tty2> Migi32, you shouldnt need to use all of dANNs source. since its open source you can choose to compile just the segments you need. but let me check what the full thing is
2010-10-03T18:23:41  <antimatroid2> i have to go to uni now
2010-10-03T18:23:43  <Migi32> haha Arekku :P
2010-10-03T18:23:48  <Migi32> see ya
2010-10-03T18:23:50  <antimatroid2> tty2: i'd be interested to chat about your library some time
2010-10-03T18:23:59  <antimatroid2> i'm trying to put together a general game theory library
2010-10-03T18:24:09  <tty2> Migi32, 572KB
2010-10-03T18:24:14  <Migi32> oh sweet :P
2010-10-03T18:24:38  <tty2> antimatroid2, join #dANN, we can discuss it anytime, and the rest of the devs are there too (im the founder though so i tend to be more familiar with all the details)
2010-10-03T18:24:57  <tty2> Migi32, as i siad you can cut that down a lot too, there is a lot of stuff in there that you can cut out for something like this, like all the visualization stuff)
2010-10-03T18:25:55  <antimatroid2> done so i don't forget later
2010-10-03T18:25:56  <antimatroid2> bye
2010-10-03T18:26:05  <tty2> antimatroid2, see ya
2010-10-03T18:26:25  <antimatroid2> oh bugger, you had me till it was written in java :P
2010-10-03T18:27:05  <antimatroid2> not keen to switch to c++? :P
2010-10-03T18:27:59  <Migi32> it is? That might not work as the compilation script doesn't handle one bot using multiple languages I believe
2010-10-03T18:28:02  <antimatroid2> have you done nd vectors yet?
2010-10-03T18:28:04  <Migi32> I'm using c++ by the way
2010-10-03T18:28:11  <tty2> antimatroid2, we have plans to continue our C++ port in the very near future and even sooner to do JNI interface
2010-10-03T18:28:16  <antimatroid2> i have an implementation for those in c++ i'd be happy to share how we did that
2010-10-03T18:28:23  <tty2> Migi32, shouldnt be hard to use java from inside C++ if you wanted, we did it tons
2010-10-03T18:28:55  <antimatroid2> it's basically all stored in a 1d vector, then we use strategy variables for indexing
2010-10-03T18:28:59  <tty2> Migi32, im not sure about the specific challenges of the build script yet
2010-10-03T18:29:09  <antimatroid2> so we can store simultaneous games as though they're in a kind of finite tensor
2010-10-03T18:29:11  <tty2> antimatroid2, and yes we have n-dimensional vectors
2010-10-03T18:29:33  <tty2> antimatroid2, and conversion between cartesian and hyperspherical coordinate systems as well
2010-10-03T18:29:44  <antimatroid2> :)
2010-10-03T18:29:46  <antimatroid2> anyway, i must run

2010-10-03T18:32:17  <JensTi1> Migi32: yes http://www.ai-contest.com/game_info.php?game_id=1 with game_id the id of the game you want

2010-10-03T18:46:20  <tty2> Migi32, im not entierly sure id go that approach at all but id have to get a little deeper into it first to speculate
