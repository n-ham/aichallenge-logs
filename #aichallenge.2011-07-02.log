2011-07-02T05:05:13  <sir_macelon> hi
2011-07-02T05:05:35  <sir_macelon> look at this game turn: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=52727&turn=42&row=61&col=36
2011-07-02T05:05:47  <sir_macelon> do you think food has been spawned fairly there?
2011-07-02T05:10:07  <mcstar> certainly not, since flagcapper won
2011-07-02T05:13:23  <mcstar> sir_macelon: pardon my insolence, but why do you expect the engine to be "fair" all the time? maybe ants should believe in god(engine) and pray to him to be fair, hm.

2011-07-02T05:19:41  <sir_macelon> mcstar: but that's why have provided symmaterical spawning, so it should be fair, but it seems it isn't in this kind of symmetry
2011-07-02T05:22:02  <mcstar> just because spawning is symmetric it doesnt imply it is fair too
2011-07-02T05:22:24  <mcstar> but these differences should average out
2011-07-02T05:22:41  <mcstar> maybe in some other situation your bot will get food similarly
2011-07-02T05:23:43  <mcstar> if the engine pays too much attention to this, and precisely controls spawning, it will control the game eventually
2011-07-02T05:23:56  <mcstar> id rather leave it more random
2011-07-02T05:25:26  <sir_macelon> i mean it assumes the food should be spawned equaliy distant from starting location, but in some situations, like the one i showed, it spawns a group of food, which luckily favours someone who is luckily around there
2011-07-02T05:27:46  <sir_macelon> if you would have this kind of symmetry for 4 players, there could be a group of 4 adjacent food spawned together, i don't like such spawning as it brings too much luck
2011-07-02T05:28:47  <mcstar> so your problem is, that foods spawned too close together? i agree thats not ideal
2011-07-02T05:29:58  <sir_macelon> this is exactly, what i mean
2011-07-02T05:30:06  <sir_macelon> look at this game: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=52240
2011-07-02T05:30:20  <sir_macelon> most of the food is spawned in the middle
2011-07-02T05:30:52  <sir_macelon> luckily my ant was there first and got it all, dominating the game and a very quick win in under 100 turns
2011-07-02T05:31:03  <mcstar> ok, thats a good point, i thought you had a different problem
2011-07-02T05:31:56  <sir_macelon> i only care here about adjacent food spawning which is not fair in my opinion
2011-07-02T05:32:16  <mcstar> in prev. version of the food spawning alg. wasnt there a check to not spawn food too close together?
2011-07-02T05:32:26  <mcstar> i dont really remmeber seeing such situtations

2011-07-02T05:50:25  <antimatroid1> mcstar: the reason you didn't see it previously was because the tile symmetry never has symmetrically equivalent squares close like that
2011-07-02T05:50:41  <antimatroid1> i hadn't thought of this problem, i'm not really sure there's anything we can do about it while keeping symmetry
2011-07-02T05:51:26  <mcstar> ?
2011-07-02T05:51:31  <antimatroid1> i will at least be able to hide where these "middle" parts of the map are with translations
2011-07-02T05:51:44  <mcstar> just call a proper distance function on the foods-to-be-spawned
2011-07-02T05:51:55  <antimatroid1> not that simple
2011-07-02T05:52:03  <antimatroid1> then you're excluding some land squares from ever spawning food
2011-07-02T05:52:05  <mcstar> why? if its too low, just ignore it
2011-07-02T05:52:05  <antimatroid1> is that fair?
2011-07-02T05:52:28  <antimatroid1> we might have to do that though
2011-07-02T05:52:30  <mcstar> i guess its better than now, dont you think?
2011-07-02T05:52:49  <antimatroid1> ^^ yeah, i just got introduced to the "problem" :P
2011-07-02T05:53:54  <mcstar> (btw my personal opinion is that symmetric food spawning sucks ass)

2011-07-02T05:56:28  <antimatroid1> we're quite limited on just how many games we can run for each bot during the final contest
2011-07-02T05:56:37  <antimatroid1> and ranking is already quite iffy

2011-07-02T05:58:02  <mcstar> look, as far as i see, the food spawning problem is significant in the first phase of the game: the expansion phase. and yes, there should be some fairness guaranteed, not to help any bot more than any other one to gain much territory in a short time
2011-07-02T05:58:54  <mcstar> im not sure yet what is the solution to that
2011-07-02T05:59:33  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2011-07-02T05:59:37  <mcstar> you can argue that symmatric spawning is, maybe, but id turn it off after a couple of turns
2011-07-02T06:02:37  <mcstar> and obviously the engine can control the expansion rate of the bots by controlling the amount of food it spawns, cotrolling the probability depending on the manhattan distance from each bot
2011-07-02T06:03:02  <mcstar> con-trolling
2011-07-02T06:03:09  <mcstar> that is a nice phrase
2011-07-02T06:03:22  <mcstar> if you troll, i will con-troll
2011-07-02T06:05:54  <antimatroid1> i'm not willing to pick spawn locations based on the current ants locations
2011-07-02T06:06:05  <antimatroid1> it opens up the game to influencing the spawn code as well
2011-07-02T06:07:00  <mcstar> no, i dont really mean that
2011-07-02T06:07:37  <mcstar> consider this: the edge of the blob(the area ants can reach) grows with the turns
2011-07-02T06:08:16  <mcstar> and i would change the probability density function with the value of this distance(the edge of the blob)
2011-07-02T06:08:55  <mcstar> and this pdf of course depends upon the distance from the spawn locations
2011-07-02T06:09:11  <mcstar> not to cause a cascade-like expansion
2011-07-02T06:09:29  <mcstar> im not saying that it should depend on individual ant locations
2011-07-02T06:09:50  <mcstar> so there could not be a back-propagation effect
2011-07-02T06:10:45  <mcstar> if you really want a fair game, i think, first of all you have to control the fast initial expansion
2011-07-02T06:12:00  <mcstar> antimatroid1: i got it
2011-07-02T06:12:27  <mcstar> Dijkstra's algorithm cant work with negative edge costs
2011-07-02T06:12:37  <mcstar> id would loop forever on those edges
2011-07-02T06:12:54  <mcstar> because it would always make the cost ever smaller
2011-07-02T06:13:44  <mcstar> and basically the criterion: h(x) <= g(x,y)+h(y) guarantees, that the a* rewritten as dijkstra's cant have negative edge cost
2011-07-02T06:15:50  <mcstar> i should find my linux tux, put it next to my monitor, and talk to it
2011-07-02T06:16:09  <mcstar> its easier than to write this on irc, and would have the same effect

2011-07-02T07:24:11  <mcstar> reading up on D* and skimming Sven Koenig's page it seems that d* could be an optimal solution, since it reuses previous paths, for new searches, and can incorporate changing environments well, but i havent fully comprehended it though
2011-07-02T07:25:04  <antimatroid> sounds interesting
2011-07-02T07:25:17  <antimatroid> i just came to ask you a question about the a* with negative weight edges
2011-07-02T07:25:32  <antimatroid> wouldn't that imply you need to use the open/closed set way with a non-monotone heuristic?
2011-07-02T07:25:37  <antimatroid> making the wikipedia page wrong?
2011-07-02T07:26:08  <antimatroid> mcstar: does that sound right?
2011-07-02T07:28:47  <mcstar> wiki says for negative edges there is the bellman ford, which detects negative cycles, and theres a variation for directed graphs with negative edges, but no negative cycles
2011-07-02T07:28:50  <SSNikolaevich> Yes. open/closed sets is needed
2011-07-02T07:29:22  <mcstar> but i would really leave this alone cause it got nothing to do with applications
2011-07-02T07:29:30  <mcstar> with our
2011-07-02T07:30:07  <SSNikolaevich> negative weights is alowed only in acyclic graphs
2011-07-02T07:30:11  <antimatroid> i'm trying to find the exact statement that confused me
2011-07-02T07:31:03  <antimatroid> i can't find the comment :\
2011-07-02T07:31:27  <mcstar> i guess they're allowed always, but algorithms broke down, obviously, but you can say, that if you find a negative cycle, you dont traverse it more than once
2011-07-02T07:31:47  <mcstar> or at all
2011-07-02T07:32:02  <mcstar> i think it depends what you are really representing with edges and costs....
2011-07-02T07:32:16  <SSNikolaevich> yes
2011-07-02T07:32:46  <antimatroid> mcstar: there's another way of ordering your search queue items
2011-07-02T07:32:50  <mcstar> the closed set is an improvement over not having them, cause it makes possible not to check again a node if it was added to the closed set
2011-07-02T07:33:19  <antimatroid> when there is a draw with f, you have fifo yes?, i say split on h, but then they also suggest making it lifo after that, or without even splitting on h
2011-07-02T07:33:21  <mcstar> antimatroid: the min(g+h) then min(h) didnt help mcuh
2011-07-02T07:33:42  <antimatroid> mcstar: but i don't ever search a location twice without the closet set :\
2011-07-02T07:33:54  <antimatroid> once i add a location to the search queue, i mark it as visited and don't touch it again
2011-07-02T07:34:23  <mcstar> i add a square to closed if i added all its nbors to open
2011-07-02T07:34:35  <mcstar> might be the same in essence
2011-07-02T07:35:02  <SSNikolaevich> a* & d* both good enought. But weight function is main challenge. It depends on enemy ants around etc.
2011-07-02T07:35:06  <antimatroid> i may be wrong, but i figure once you add a location to the search queue, you can't possibly find a shorter path to it
2011-07-02T07:35:12  <antimatroid> otherwise it would have already been added
2011-07-02T07:35:29  * antimatroid still doesn't get weighted a*?
2011-07-02T07:35:36  <SSNikolaevich> its wrong.
2011-07-02T07:35:37  <mcstar> its just c*h
2011-07-02T07:35:48  <mcstar> ok? just scale up the heuristics
2011-07-02T07:36:03  <antimatroid> yeah, but i don't get why it improves it
2011-07-02T07:36:04  <antimatroid> etc. etc.
2011-07-02T07:36:06  <mcstar> the criterion that h(target)=0 will sill hold
2011-07-02T07:36:12  <antimatroid> i like to wrap my head around the why of things
2011-07-02T07:36:15  <mcstar> but you dont check that many nodes
2011-07-02T07:36:22  <mcstar> but you sacrifice optimality
2011-07-02T07:36:47  <mcstar> you scale up the gap between solutions
2011-07-02T07:36:53  <mcstar> but you dont scale up g

2011-07-02T07:38:36  <SSNikolaevich> and it is not required to make full search. Search with fixed max depth is enought to determine the aproximate direction for ant. I tested this on my test cases
2011-07-02T07:38:58  <antimatroid> SSNikolaevich: have you played around with pathfinding with multiple targets yet?
2011-07-02T07:39:12  <antimatroid> i have got it working with a*, but mcstar has me interested in d*
2011-07-02T07:40:00  <SSNikolaevich> yes. It is my real live work :)
2011-07-02T07:41:08  <mcstar> SSNikolaevich: you work in ai? robotics maybe?
2011-07-02T07:41:17  <SSNikolaevich> CAD
2011-07-02T07:41:31  <SSNikolaevich> placement & routing
2011-07-02T07:42:05  <mcstar> hm, i never really considered this, but cad/graphics applications has many of these ai algorithms
2011-07-02T07:42:11  <antimatroid> SSNikolaevich:  what is your take on path finding with multiple targets then?
2011-07-02T07:42:30  <antimatroid> i've just been using h(x) = min_T mdist(x, T)
2011-07-02T07:43:21  <SSNikolaevich> no. I'm fighting with timeouts in my bot now :(
2011-07-02T07:43:27  <antimatroid> which language?
2011-07-02T07:43:44  <mcstar> SSNikolaevich: are you used to supercomputers? :D
2011-07-02T07:43:50  <SSNikolaevich> python
2011-07-02T07:44:07  <antimatroid> that's going to be really slow for this contest :)
2011-07-02T07:44:18  <SSNikolaevich> computational claster in LAN
2011-07-02T07:44:18  <antimatroid> that's my claim anyway
2011-07-02T07:44:36  <mcstar> i like clusters too, wrote for them in mpi
2011-07-02T07:44:44  <antimatroid> mcstar: http://ants.zeroviz.us/AxIF2/ 5 player symmetry still weirds me out :P
2011-07-02T07:45:35  <SSNikolaevich> we using OpenMP, Erlang ant task scheduling
2011-07-02T07:46:00  <mcstar> omg erlang?
2011-07-02T07:46:09  <mcstar> i read that its good for concurrency
2011-07-02T07:46:40  <mcstar> well, we use c, its for  physics simulations, no need for functional languages :)
2011-07-02T07:46:42  <SSNikolaevich> Bot may be slow because of algorithms, not because language.
2011-07-02T07:47:41  <SSNikolaevich> Functional languages is good for multiprocess applications because they have no side effects.
2011-07-02T07:48:33  <mcstar> antimatroid: nice idea on the superlattice
2011-07-02T07:49:09  <antimatroid> mcstar: the recursive backtrack maze generation technique seemed easiest :P
2011-07-02T07:49:14  <antimatroid> so i had to do that to implement it :P
2011-07-02T07:50:36  <SSNikolaevich> Start width search from food is good, if your bot have anought time
2011-07-02T08:12:35  <antimatroid> ... is it worth doing the searches in reverse
2011-07-02T08:12:41  <antimatroid> just so you can get the path out easier
2011-07-02T08:13:08  <antimatroid> i doubt it, i imagine it'd be better to minimise the number of targets if possible
2011-07-02T08:17:43  <SSNikolaevich> and how you search path too food? from every ant? From closest subset of ants? The main goal of searching from food it is one search instead multiple
2011-07-02T08:24:50  <antimatroid> i search from all (my) ants to all food
2011-07-02T08:24:52  <antimatroid> or vice versa
2011-07-02T08:25:21  <antimatroid> i'm going to use a deque of moves for my paths, so it doesn't matter which way i do it
2011-07-02T08:25:34  <antimatroid> then i might get it to split which way it does it based on the size of the sources and target sets
2011-07-02T08:25:35  <mcstar> i have an idea: just add all the h together h_f1+h_f2+h_f3 and use this as a heuristic function searching for food from 1 ant
2011-07-02T08:25:43  <SSNikolaevich> its very expensive in term of time
2011-07-02T08:25:57  <antimatroid> SSNikolaevich: how?
2011-07-02T08:26:04  <antimatroid> i would have expected it to be quicker..
2011-07-02T08:26:18  <antimatroid> for just bfs's it would surely be quicker
2011-07-02T08:26:30  <antimatroid> my heuristic function is a bit iffy though when there is a large number of targets
2011-07-02T08:26:51  <antimatroid> oh, maybe not for bfs
2011-07-02T08:26:52  <antimatroid> hmm, dunno
2011-07-02T08:26:53  <SSNikolaevich> width search from food is too expencive in python. I'm search path to food from 5 closes ants
2011-07-02T08:26:57  <antimatroid> i'm writing up test stuff now
2011-07-02T08:27:00  <SSNikolaevich> closes=closest
2011-07-02T08:27:10  <antimatroid> c++ <3 :)
2011-07-02T08:27:22  <SSNikolaevich> ;)
2011-07-02T08:29:42  <SSNikolaevich> C++ is good. But is require free time. I have work to do, family, which don't allow me to write bot in home. That's why i use python: rapid development and prototyping
2011-07-02T08:33:20  <antimatroid> i find c++ easier to program in anyway, as it's what i know best
2011-07-02T08:33:36  <antimatroid> my python skills are minimal at best
2011-07-02T08:34:36  <SSNikolaevich> I'm familiar with C++, python and erlang. But don't have anought free time to write in C++ :(
2011-07-02T08:36:42  <SSNikolaevich> games is stoped now. Anybody knows why?
2011-07-02T08:38:04  <mcstar> yeah, i know that was a stupid idea in itself, but ill improve on ti

2011-07-02T10:05:08  <antimatroid> anyone know how i'd do a comparison operator for structs in c++ to do l/fifo for priorit_queues
2011-07-02T10:07:34  <mcstar> i know this isnt what you want, but why not just write a function which test all .elements ?
2011-07-02T10:07:48  <mcstar> (sure you can even overload =, cant you)
2011-07-02T10:09:38  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-07-02T10:09:47  <antimatroid> i want a priority queue of search items
2011-07-02T10:10:06  <antimatroid> and i want to be able to set the comparison operator with variables when calling a search
2011-07-02T10:11:06  <antimatroid> i think i'ma need to mark numbers for order in which i found a square
2011-07-02T10:11:22  <antimatroid> i can overload = and ==
2011-07-02T10:12:11  <mcstar> yeah, i meant ==

2011-07-02T10:13:09  <mcstar> when the list is almost sorted, the sort is very fast

2011-07-02T10:34:50  <mcstar> all the rules are there
2011-07-02T10:35:02  <antimatroid1> yeah, specs wiki page is the best place to look
2011-07-02T10:35:05  <mcstar> or you can take a look at a starter pack already written
2011-07-02T10:35:14  <antimatroid1> if you know c++ i'm of the biased opinion that my starter bot for that is worth basing bots off :)
2011-07-02T10:36:02  <mcstar> well, he is writing in closure, so pls rather take a look at the common lisp version

2011-07-02T10:37:23  <pcavs> Thanks for being helpful, I will probably end up bothering this group with more questions in the future
2011-07-02T10:37:43  <mcstar> i guess the channel was created for this exact purpose :)
2011-07-02T10:37:52  <pcavs> haha, indeed ;)
2011-07-02T10:39:52  <smiley1983> there's also a scala bot, which might be worth looking at. Someone named tnbd was asking about a clojure starter pack recently, but from grepping the channel logs it seems there hasn't been any mention of one being developed yet
2011-07-02T10:40:58  <antimatroid1> sigh__, smiley1983: what's the best way for me to make a priority_queue in c++ fifo or lifo on elements that are otherwise "equal"?
2011-07-02T10:41:12  <antimatroid1> is it to just store a variable indicating the order in which i added items and comparing based off that?
2011-07-02T10:42:20  <smiley1983> I don't know enough about c++ to answer that
2011-07-02T10:42:28  <sigh__> antimatroid1: yes, that sounds reasonable
2011-07-02T10:43:37  <antimatroid1> damn, cheers
2011-07-02T10:43:42  <antimatroid1> i was hoping there'd be something neater :P
2011-07-02T10:44:02  <mcstar> smiley1983: maybe it was asked yesterday? i think i let that question pass me by
2011-07-02T10:44:24  <antimatroid1> i vaguely remember someone asking something like that recently
2011-07-02T10:44:24  <smiley1983> 2011-07-01T09:00:18  <tnbd> Is anyone creating a clojure starter pack?
2011-07-02T10:47:02  <mcstar> antimatroid1: cant you just put the pointers to those structs in a vector? (push, or something?)
2011-07-02T10:47:26  <antimatroid1> mcstar: i want to use normal priority_queues as implemented in c++
2011-07-02T10:47:35  <antimatroid1> they're implemented as a heap as far as i know
2011-07-02T10:47:42  <mcstar> (im not saying i know it better, im just curious, i dont mind a small cpp sticking to me)
2011-07-02T10:47:58  <antimatroid1> i give it a type, something to store it in (a vector) and a comparison operator for determining "max" elements (which can give a min operator if you want)
2011-07-02T10:48:37  <sigh__> you can do what mcstar says and store vectors instead of values, but that is much more code to maintain
2011-07-02T10:48:55  <sigh__> or the quick hacky solution is to store x+k*epsilon for equals values x
2011-07-02T10:49:12  <antimatroid1> like priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > will give a priority queue of integers, stored in a vector that is "sorted" with >, so when you retrieve the last element (top) then you get the least element in the priority queue
2011-07-02T10:49:47  <sigh__> antimatroid1: you'd pretty much be rolling your own implementation for that :
2011-07-02T10:49:49  <antimatroid1> sigh__: i wouldn't use +k*e, i just add the code into my comparison operator
2011-07-02T10:50:11  <sigh__> yup, that's normal
2011-07-02T10:50:58  <mcstar> well, i did this with a second comparison
2011-07-02T10:51:06  <antimatroid1> i don't like that the comparison thing needs to be a struct/class either :P
2011-07-02T10:51:18  <antimatroid1> it would be cooler if i could just pass it an operator/function, pesky c++
2011-07-02T10:51:38  <mcstar> i checked for (if (< sum min-sum) (do this and this))
2011-07-02T10:51:49  <mcstar> (if (= sum min-sum) (do another thing))
2011-07-02T10:52:05  <antimatroid1> oh, i could min/max g for fifo lifo?
2011-07-02T10:52:06  <mcstar> where sum is g+h
2011-07-02T10:52:30  <mcstar> and where its =, i check for (< h hmin)
2011-07-02T10:52:34  <antimatroid1> i think that'd work?
2011-07-02T10:53:01  <antimatroid1> close enough to fifo/lifo for what i want anyway, mcstar: does that sound right? :P
2011-07-02T10:53:17  <mcstar> sorry, which one? :S
2011-07-02T10:53:42  <antimatroid1> g(x) := mdist(source, x)
2011-07-02T10:53:56  <antimatroid1> no it's not
2011-07-02T10:53:59  <antimatroid1> it's the path distance to x
2011-07-02T10:54:15  <antimatroid1> that wouldn't do it :(

2011-07-02T11:02:01  <antimatroid1> yeah
2011-07-02T11:02:04  <mcstar> because you could try searching from a food square where are more food squares close by, that makes sense
2011-07-02T11:02:33  <mcstar> let me think
2011-07-02T11:02:51  <antimatroid1> i think if you did that with fifo on a draw then you'd get the optimal solution? and not with lifo
2011-07-02T11:02:56  <antimatroid1> if my intuition is correct
2011-07-02T11:04:28  <mcstar> well, if you use strictly f=g+h, where h is the manhattan distance, you can prioritise whatever the way you like
2011-07-02T11:04:57  <antimatroid1> no i mean like, min f, min h, if both of those are equal, then lifo or fifo
2011-07-02T11:05:07  <mcstar> but since you are searching for an ant now, i dont think you should be preferring food squares
2011-07-02T11:05:44  <mcstar> there cant be many such cases where both are equal
2011-07-02T11:05:52  <mcstar> the open set supposed to be small

2011-07-02T13:11:05  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: what do you think about not spawning food next to each other?  That would effectively make the land area control percentage not match food spawning percentages
2011-07-02T13:11:05  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-07-02T13:12:11  <McLeopold> The dead area would always be on symmetric lines, which would be fair
2011-07-02T13:12:55  <McLeopold> The fact that your on land that doesn't spawn may balance with the fact the food could spawn 4 squares apart sometimes
2011-07-02T13:13:31  <McLeopold> It seems similar to the "no planets closer than 1" of the last contest

2011-07-02T13:44:51  <qacek> Hi, at one point I heard that an ant could still "see" for 1 turn after it died. I see the game spec has been updated on the wiki and I don't see any mention of this. Has this idea been axed?
2011-07-02T13:47:28  <mcstar> definitely not true now
2011-07-02T13:49:35  <mcstar> VilleH: its still beta, they dont yet send emails, and try running your bot with test_bot.sh
2011-07-02T13:50:14  <mcstar> and make sure you have the latest tools from github
2011-07-02T13:57:50  <VilleH> mcstar: Just downloaded the tools today, so I think they should be latest.

2011-07-02T14:23:29  <mcstar> so with play_one_game it runs perfectly ok? no timeouts or somesuch?
2011-07-02T14:27:24  <amstan> VilleH: make sure you have the same mono version
2011-07-02T14:27:35  <amstan> VilleH: also.. it might behave differently under linux

2011-07-02T14:42:44  <VilleH> as on the beta pages doesn't have whole package

2011-07-02T14:57:44  <jmreardon> VilleH: when a bot times out it gets kicked out of the match, so, yes, it matters
2011-07-02T14:58:19  <VilleH> Of course, but in those test cases I meant
2011-07-02T14:58:39  <VilleH> As those bots doesn't get kicked out of the match on local computer
2011-07-02T14:59:21  <amstan> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/207
2011-07-02T15:04:13  <jmreardon> VilleH: the test cases just seem to run the game on a certain map against a certain bot. Apparently the C# bot can't handle something about it

2011-07-02T17:37:46  <mcstar> i thought you referred to the conversation with jm reardon
2011-07-02T17:38:02  <mcstar> what code base?
2011-07-02T17:39:01  <VilleH> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge I presume that those test cases are also somewhere in there?
2011-07-02T17:40:36  <mcstar> you mean the test_bot?
2011-07-02T17:40:50  <mcstar> thats just a simple game on a small map

2011-07-02T17:42:17  <VilleH> When I upload that c# bot it doesn't pass the test
2011-07-02T17:43:07  <mcstar> amstan confirmed that theres a problem with the cx starter bot right?

2011-07-02T17:43:50  <VilleH> yeah
2011-07-02T17:44:12  <mcstar> then try to use antimatroid1's cpp starter bot
2011-07-02T17:45:00  <mcstar> i guess something changed on the server side, the c# must have worked at some point
2011-07-02T17:46:15  <VilleH> cpp starter bot works. But I'd presume that they are using same on server which is in github and c# passes latest release from there on local computer
2011-07-02T17:47:13  <VilleH> yeah, there are few developers using and running c# bots
2011-07-02T17:47:20  <mcstar> the server is ubuntu version whatever, but not the latest i think
2011-07-02T17:49:47  <mcstar> do you output anything to stderr?
2011-07-02T17:50:41  <VilleH> nope, does it print those out when testing?
2011-07-02T17:51:32  <mcstar> it might
2011-07-02T17:51:57  <mcstar> but i was afraid that the sandbox might think theres an error, and abort the test if you use stderr

2011-07-02T22:46:51  <antimatroid1> i've had problems before with collecting food, i think it's when the test case tests my bot with no ants, or no food or something
2011-07-02T22:47:12  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure why it would test a bot with no ants? a bot should never be passed a state to make moves if it has no ants, it's out of hte game
