2012-01-14T06:59:08  <mcstar> hey
2012-01-14T07:00:07  <mcstar> conor_f: is it correct?

2012-01-14T07:03:38  <conor_f> wait which? what I pasted?
2012-01-14T07:03:49  <conor_f> thats the solution they gave, so I presume it's correct :P

2012-01-14T07:10:56  <mcstar> btw a scalar is something that remains the same wrt coordinate transformations

2012-01-14T07:11:03  <mcstar> it is an invariant

2012-01-14T07:11:42  <Guest61192> a scalar is the inverse of a vector... because you use integration or differentiation to solve for the other

2012-01-14T09:48:07  <Colors> you posted that for what problem
2012-01-14T09:48:07  <mcstar> why would you say: "scalar is distance vector is distance and direction" when we are talking about some algorithmic problem?
2012-01-14T09:49:12  <mcstar> Colors: did you talk to conor before?

2012-01-14T09:51:39  <pairofdice> Welcome to Internet
2012-01-14T09:51:47  <Colors> you know what originally made me thinking of using such basic trig, the greeks method of exhaustion... to solve for the area of a circle
2012-01-14T09:52:11  <Colors> A: using triangles B: solving for every small increase of area from a triangle to a circle
2012-01-14T09:53:15  <Colors> giving you many permutations... that you would sum and derive the constant pi
2012-01-14T09:53:27  <Colors> same concept still using triangles
2012-01-14T09:53:37  <Colors> only with a much simpler geometry... a square
2012-01-14T09:59:03  <mcstar> "you posted that for what problem" -> obviously you didnt read the paste, thx, it is the solution to a physics problem which involved a point mass sliding frictionless down a free wedge
2012-01-14T09:59:43  <mcstar> Colors: it has nothing to do with cicles greeks, pi, cows, algorithms, and you
2012-01-14T10:00:13  <Colors> tsk tsk

2012-01-14T10:03:51  <mcstar> very imformative link for elementary school students
2012-01-14T10:04:39  <Colors> I'm sorry I made it too simple for even you
2012-01-14T10:06:19  <Colors> I just thought, something like http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AITechniques.html would be a little over kill
2012-01-14T10:06:53  <mcstar> i didnt find much use for amit's collection for aichallenge
2012-01-14T10:07:40  <mcstar> Colors: still, do you understand that there are two separate problems here?
2012-01-14T10:08:15  <Colors> and they both can be solved  using the same exact arithmetic
2012-01-14T10:08:34  <Colors> what are you solving for with the physics equations?
2012-01-14T10:08:50  <mcstar> did you read it?
2012-01-14T10:08:57  <Colors> slope yea?
2012-01-14T10:09:03  <mcstar> if you did you know
2012-01-14T10:09:09  <Colors> in relation to force
2012-01-14T10:09:13  <mcstar> im not solving "for the slope"
2012-01-14T10:09:28  <mcstar> there are 2 bodies
2012-01-14T10:09:31  <mcstar> with mas m and M
2012-01-14T10:09:34  <mcstar> mass*
2012-01-14T10:09:53  <mcstar> these accelerate when the system is released
2012-01-14T10:10:02  <mcstar> the solution is this acceleration
2012-01-14T10:10:17  <mcstar> or you can do whatever with it afterwards, compute trajectories whatever
2012-01-14T10:14:43  <Colors> so if force = mass * acceleration
2012-01-14T10:15:15  <Colors> and acceleration is the change in distance per second ^ 2?
2012-01-14T10:15:55  <mcstar> so if what?
2012-01-14T10:16:30  <Colors> then calculating the slope of a triangle which is also the hypotenuse... as distance changes
2012-01-14T10:16:55  <mcstar> the slope is given
2012-01-14T10:16:55  <Colors> then what it you'd be doing for both problems is "X is the distance of the tip of the right angle triangle from the origo, x is the distance of the point mass from X, in the x direction, and y is the distance of the point mass from the ground, in the y direction
2012-01-14T10:16:55  <Colors> so the coordinate of the point mass in the x direction from the origo is x+X "
2012-01-14T10:17:35  <mcstar> you dont need to quote what i wrote
2012-01-14T10:19:14  <Colors> scalar is your distance, the slope, the hypotenuse.... and the vector is length + width, x + y , delta(x) / delta(y)
2012-01-14T10:20:17  <Colors> if you put that on a grid with discretized coordinates... you get points instead of lines... but the same applies

2012-01-14T10:34:11  <antimatroid> i wonder if that path counting problem could be useful for a tron bot
2012-01-14T10:34:46  <Colors> sort've
2012-01-14T10:35:02  <sigh> I don't think so, since you are essentially enumerating all the paths
2012-01-14T10:35:08  <Colors> the goal is different... you're objective is to corner the opponent
2012-01-14T10:35:13  <antimatroid> is it that expensive to count?
2012-01-14T10:35:20  <antimatroid> i guess so :P
2012-01-14T10:36:03  <Colors> the first thing you do in tron... is try and gain the larger area
2012-01-14T10:36:18  <Colors> so you cut the area somewhere close to half or a half of a half
2012-01-14T10:37:01  <antimatroid> i know that
2012-01-14T10:37:15  <antimatroid> i did write a bot for the tron contest
2012-01-14T10:37:34  <Colors> something, I thought of that's unique for the path counting problem
2012-01-14T10:37:39  <Colors> cows right?
2012-01-14T10:38:10  <Colors> that... each coordinate can hold 2 states
2012-01-14T10:38:22  <Colors> allowing for a boolean grid
2012-01-14T10:38:38  <Colors> 0 if you can move to that x, y coordinate
2012-01-14T10:38:59  <Colors> 1 if you've been their already, or 1 if there is an obstacle
2012-01-14T10:39:01  <Colors> right?
2012-01-14T10:39:05  <sigh> that's... exactly the solution that conor_f posted?
2012-01-14T10:39:30  <Colors> because of that... you can use a karnaugh map to reduce the grid
2012-01-14T10:39:54  <sigh> I don't think you know what you are talking about

2012-01-14T10:45:09  <Colors> because
2012-01-14T10:45:20  <mcstar> but why?
2012-01-14T10:45:46  <mcstar> "and the vector is length + width"
2012-01-14T10:45:53  <Colors> that is the number of combinations you get from 2 bits
2012-01-14T10:46:02  <mcstar> thats gonna revolutionize math

2012-01-14T10:46:50  <sigh> lol
2012-01-14T10:46:52  <Colors> it's total distance as opposed to displacement
2012-01-14T10:47:53  <Colors> the above boolean equation simplifies to A or B = Y
2012-01-14T10:48:18  <mcstar> displacement is a proper vector, distance isnt
2012-01-14T10:48:35  <Colors> now is that not a major reduction
2012-01-14T10:48:53  <Colors> displacement is a scalar
