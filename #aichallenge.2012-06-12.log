2012-06-12T22:57:21  <McLeopold> hey
2012-06-12T22:58:16  <McLeopold> so, first I'd like to complain that someone took my nick on minecraft
2012-06-12T22:58:27  <amstan> yeah, i had the same problem
2012-06-12T22:58:41  <amstan> so i couldn't use my usual gaming nick: siralex
2012-06-12T22:59:02  <McLeopold> my name sucks so much that I've never run into this before
2012-06-12T22:59:38  <McLeopold> I figure Mc for MineCraft may be a common prefix?
2012-06-12T22:59:47  <amstan> idk
2012-06-12T23:00:06  <McLeopold> anyway, how do I play the game without paying money? :)
2012-06-12T23:00:56  <thestinger> kill someone who has it
2012-06-12T23:00:58  * thestinger runs
2012-06-12T23:01:10  <amstan> just buy it
2012-06-12T23:01:31  <McLeopold> so, no solution then...
2012-06-12T23:01:57  <amstan> there's frequent updates, and part of the servers security against impersonators relies on the central login system
2012-06-12T23:02:14  <McLeopold> I just want to play SMP
2012-06-12T23:03:00  <McLeopold> also, a1k0n rickrolled me with a DCPU16 program
2012-06-12T23:03:03  <amstan> most servers won't let you in without a user account on the central server
2012-06-12T23:03:29  <thestinger> yes, otherwise you can't ban people properly
2012-06-12T23:03:32  <McLeopold> But, single player?  Shouldn't need a server, right?
2012-06-12T23:03:51  <thestinger> McLeopold: what's the fun of singleplayer? :P
2012-06-12T23:04:11  <McLeopold> It looks fun to me, what's the fun of multiplayer?
2012-06-12T23:04:23  <amstan> McLeopold: it's singleplayer+more
2012-06-12T23:04:38  <thestinger> testosterone fueled competition
2012-06-12T23:04:47  <thestinger> singleplayer gets boring pretty quickly imo
2012-06-12T23:04:59  <thestinger> as does joining a server that's existed for a while
2012-06-12T23:05:10  <thestinger> building stuff with people is fun :)
2012-06-12T23:06:31  <McLeopold> so, anyone want to start the next contest?
2012-06-12T23:08:20  <amstan> McLeopold: so opening a bank account is relatively easy
2012-06-12T23:08:29  <amstan> no need to incorporate and all that
2012-06-12T23:08:52  <amstan> McLeopold: then janzert's busy this summer
2012-06-12T23:09:03  <amstan> McLeopold: and j3camero wants to joing deving, he's back to google
2012-06-12T23:09:13  <amstan> no more time consuming financial job
2012-06-12T23:11:45  <amstan> McLeopold: now we need to get organized and start deving
2012-06-12T23:15:30  <Zannick> jeff is working at google again?
2012-06-12T23:15:41  <Zannick> i knew he left the other job
2012-06-12T23:15:48  <amstan> i heard he was moving to google
2012-06-12T23:15:52  <McLeopold> ohh, that's good news
2012-06-12T23:15:56  <Zannick> cool
2012-06-12T23:16:03  <McLeopold> maybe, if he shows up on irc again
2012-06-12T23:16:09  <amstan> contestbot: seen j3camero
2012-06-12T23:16:09  <contestbot> amstan: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 6 weeks, 1 day, 2 hours, 22 minutes, and 57 seconds ago: <j3camero> good ideas all around
2012-06-12T23:16:22  <amstan> that's when he told me
2012-06-12T23:16:32  <amstan> he's been on gtalk a few times
2012-06-12T23:16:53  <McLeopold> ah
