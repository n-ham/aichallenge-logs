2011-04-01T02:01:18  <antimatroid> McLeopold: how are symmetric maps going?
2011-04-01T02:01:36  <McLeopold> ok
2011-04-01T02:01:50  <McLeopold> I've got the framework for carving symmetrically
2011-04-01T02:02:07  <McLeopold> I just need the finish the function to create symmetric points
2011-04-01T02:02:34  <sigh> are you using the same type of symmetry that antimatroid had?
2011-04-01T02:02:44  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure yes
2011-04-01T02:02:56  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you doing the check to make sure players never start in the same row or column?
2011-04-01T02:03:38  <McLeopold> No, I'm not doing that type of check, but it might come out like that sometimes.
2011-04-01T02:03:55  <antimatroid> you will break symmetric spawning as it currently is if you do that
2011-04-01T02:03:57  <sigh> then food gen will need ot be updated
2011-04-01T02:04:07  <antimatroid> well, don't do that :P
2011-04-01T02:04:43  <McLeopold> if 2 starts are in the same row or column, food spawning breaks?
2011-04-01T02:05:05  <antimatroid> possibly, because it may get a row and col translate that doesn't take n iterations to loop
2011-04-01T02:06:00  <antimatroid> we could make row and col translate parameters at the top of the map
2011-04-01T02:06:03  <antimatroid> then it wouldn't matter
2011-04-01T02:06:28  <antimatroid> but it's visually less appealing if players start like that, because then the lattices are more obvious
2011-04-01T02:06:38  <sigh> meh, we'll see about food gen after McLeopold finishes his maps
2011-04-01T02:06:56  <antimatroid> yeah, just noting why it isn't really important :P
2011-04-01T02:07:04  <sigh> McLeopold: can I ask you something about replays and the engine?
2011-04-01T02:07:26  <McLeopold> yeah, also, I just replied to an email from Frontier
2011-04-01T02:07:50  <McLeopold> That format looks really good, nice work.
2011-04-01T02:07:50  <McLeopold> I'm thinking maybe the mapname could be a map url? so mapurl: "tcp.zeroviz.us/ants/maps/random4.map".  That means the replay could be passed around and we still know where the map file resource is.  Do we still need an "a" as the first element of the array if it is in an ants array?
2011-04-01T02:07:52  <antimatroid> .. i have time for a food bonus chat if you two do?
2011-04-01T02:07:58  <McLeopold> ^^ that was my reply
2011-04-01T02:08:06  <sigh> I want the engine/playgame to be able to output replays on stdout so it can be piped into a visualiser
2011-04-01T02:08:08  <McLeopold> I need to go, actually
2011-04-01T02:08:13  <sigh> ah ok :(
2011-04-01T02:08:14  <antimatroid> all good
2011-04-01T02:08:21  <McLeopold> sigh: that would be the streaming format?
2011-04-01T02:08:29  <sigh> either format
2011-04-01T02:08:44  <sigh> main point is that current output should be to stderr
2011-04-01T02:08:52  <sigh> and replay/streaming should be on stdout
2011-04-01T02:08:57  <McLeopold> ok
2011-04-01T02:09:03  <sigh> cool, will do that
2011-04-01T02:09:08  <McLeopold> verbose puts everything to stderr then
2011-04-01T02:09:12  <sigh> yup
2011-04-01T02:09:24  <McLeopold> sigh: did you implement the food bonus yet?
2011-04-01T02:09:36  <sigh> McLeopold: not yet
2011-04-01T02:09:53  <McLeopold> could you hack that up real quick, people are starting to talk about scoring now
2011-04-01T02:10:05  <sigh> ok, when I get home
2011-04-01T02:10:11  <McLeopold> turns_left*spawn rate
2011-04-01T02:10:17  <sigh> I don't really understand the justification for it that well though
2011-04-01T02:10:18  <McLeopold> Doesn't need to be perfect
2011-04-01T02:10:27  <sigh> it seems quite arbitrary
2011-04-01T02:10:29  <McLeopold> janzert can help explain
2011-04-01T02:10:33  <sigh> ok :)
2011-04-01T02:10:37  <McLeopold> But, it is to encourage short game
2011-04-01T02:10:38  <McLeopold> s
2011-04-01T02:10:48  <sigh> yeah, I get that
2011-04-01T02:10:52  <sigh> anyway, I'll let you go
2011-04-01T02:10:56  <McLeopold> and to help make sure the last bot standing wins
2011-04-01T02:10:59  <sigh> I'll harass antimatroid and janzert
2011-04-01T02:11:02  <McLeopold> ok
2011-04-01T02:11:13  <McLeopold> oh, and check out ants.zeroviz.us
2011-04-01T02:11:18  <sigh> i saw :P
2011-04-01T02:11:26  <McLeopold> I know django now
2011-04-01T02:11:29  <sigh> :)
2011-04-01T02:11:46  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i think the current scoring already kind of encourages a good game, but we an talk about it later
2011-04-01T02:11:55  <antimatroid> i think we should at least simplify the food bonus
2011-04-01T02:12:00  <antimatroid> but we can talk about that later
2011-04-01T02:12:44  <antimatroid> sigh: it stops the farming
2011-04-01T02:12:58  <antimatroid> if there are two players left, they can sort of continue the game and increase each others relative placing
2011-04-01T02:13:04  <antimatroid> the food bonus makes you both fight for that?
2011-04-01T02:13:36  <antimatroid> it might be necessary for that

2011-04-01T02:21:04  <sigh> one thing odd about the food bonus is that it depends on the length of the game
2011-04-01T02:21:54  <sigh> so games that are 500 moves long are very different to games that are 2000 moves long

2011-04-01T16:42:31  <phire> 7 hours, but a lot of groundwork was layed out as well
2011-04-01T16:42:59  <Stocha> the map doesn't really strike as a path finding challenge :p
2011-04-01T16:43:11  <Stocha> 7 hours; wow.
2011-04-01T16:43:31  <Stocha> i think i took me like 2 days, to make about the same.
2011-04-01T16:43:53  <Stocha> not full time
2011-04-01T16:44:14  <Stocha> but i also made the engine, for my simulation framework.
2011-04-01T16:44:31  <phire> yeah, I trimmed it down to actual work done
2011-04-01T16:44:37  <Stocha> but the map isn't very informative here.
2011-04-01T16:44:50  <Stocha> what does the groundwork involves ?

2011-04-01T16:45:10  <Stocha> what's next also ?
2011-04-01T16:45:27  <Stocha> i think i went this way : Pure random bot, and some other random stuff
2011-04-01T16:45:39  <Stocha> then i wen : all closest ant to food, try to go to that food
2011-04-01T16:45:55  <Stocha> at some point i added some collision control, i don't remember when
2011-04-01T16:46:12  <Stocha> then i went for the either a bit of exploration, or more advance food
2011-04-01T16:46:31  <phire> yeah, collision control is next
2011-04-01T16:46:35  <Stocha> the more advanced food being : one food is assigned only one ant. That made one hell of a difference in food speed
2011-04-01T16:46:46  <Stocha> my first collision control was buggy i think
2011-04-01T16:47:26  <Stocha> i may have one that works now. And it is easilly plugable. Although everything is probably quite slow. I went more for expressivness rather than speed.
2011-04-01T16:47:34  <Stocha> i do very simples things.
2011-04-01T16:48:07  <phire> I think I might be over designing mine
2011-04-01T16:48:11  <phire> but we will see

2011-04-01T16:48:41  <Stocha> you mean you have a lot of plans already ?
2011-04-01T16:48:50  <Stocha> My simple bots are nowhere sufficient
2011-04-01T16:48:58  <Stocha> i have some simple stuff to add though.
2011-04-01T16:49:18  <Stocha> then there is the matter of fighting
2011-04-01T16:49:31  <Stocha> i tryed to do some gate control. It was total fiasco
2011-04-01T16:49:32  <phire> oh yeah that
2011-04-01T16:49:39  <Stocha> in fact i wasn't even able to spot the gates :p
2011-04-01T16:50:17  <Stocha> i also tried sotftly to make the ants goes in nice formation (roman army like) That wasn't very sucessfull
2011-04-01T16:50:44  <Stocha> it was funny to imagine, i just didn't get it right. Maybe it is not as easy as going for food. And probably not as efficient for performances :p
2011-04-01T16:51:15  <Stocha> Although 3x3 ants formations moving together might do damage to simple minded bots with the Damage(x=1) rule.
2011-04-01T16:51:22  <phire> I'm thinking that I might split a small section of the board off for battle simulations
2011-04-01T16:51:42  <phire> maybe a 10x10 area
2011-04-01T16:51:47  <Stocha> you mean you'll build a special map ?
2011-04-01T16:51:56  <phire> with 5-10 ants on each side
2011-04-01T16:52:09  <Stocha> with your prefered ascii tool
2011-04-01T16:52:14  <phire> and then run detailed simulations over the next 10 turns
2011-04-01T16:52:46  <Stocha> what does that mean ?
2011-04-01T16:53:04  <phire> I'm not explaining this well
2011-04-01T16:53:18  <Stocha> i have designed a tool for build fighting maps for testing. Like yours i guess. I'm just not in the mood for implementing it.
2011-04-01T16:53:28  <Stocha> i'm french by the way.
2011-04-01T16:53:44  <Stocha> do you mean you'll move ants by hand ?
2011-04-01T16:53:48  <Stocha> or will they go at random ?
2011-04-01T16:53:49  <phire> my plan is, when my AI sees a group of my ants about to engage with enemy ants
2011-04-01T16:53:52  <Stocha> will they go straight ?
2011-04-01T16:54:15  <phire> I will create a sub simulation, with just those ants
2011-04-01T16:54:27  <Stocha> that would be a montecarlo solver ?
2011-04-01T16:54:28  <phire> and attempt to solve the battle like a chess game
2011-04-01T16:54:53  <Stocha> i have made some rough testing about a montecarlo food gatherer. Just to see.
2011-04-01T16:55:00  <phire> something that would be impossible to do over the whole map
2011-04-01T16:55:01  <Stocha> it was rough indeed. I wasn't confident.
2011-04-01T16:55:10  <Stocha> especially because the computing power is so scarce.

2011-04-01T16:55:22  <Stocha> will you do alpha beta ?
2011-04-01T16:55:33  <Stocha> or montecarlo trees ?
2011-04-01T16:55:56  <phire> no idea, haven't gotten that far yet
2011-04-01T16:55:59  <Stocha> alpha beta , or tree i should say.
2011-04-01T16:56:06  <phire> I will need to do some research
2011-04-01T16:56:21  <Stocha> you only now you want to make a solver for close fighting :p
2011-04-01T16:56:29  <Stocha> with limiting the number of ants considered.
2011-04-01T16:56:51  <Stocha> i'm wondering of the simple 3x3 formation is not enougth
2011-04-01T16:56:57  <Stocha> or raw double lined formation
2011-04-01T16:57:09  <Stocha> (well that would be simple formations)
2011-04-01T16:57:14  <phire> I don't think formations are going to really work
2011-04-01T16:57:20  <Stocha> why not ?
2011-04-01T16:57:51  <Stocha> at this point, there is great chances that formation will be my first try at combat anyway. So we might see how it does.
2011-04-01T16:57:51  <phire> the problem is that the battles are over in a single turn
2011-04-01T16:58:01  <Stocha> ?
2011-04-01T16:58:25  <Stocha> basically there is two stages in the game.
2011-04-01T16:58:53  <Stocha> in the begining you might have complicated combats. With arbitration between food exploration and gathering for fight.
2011-04-01T16:59:13  <Stocha> then in the second part of the game (depending on the map, you might only get one )
2011-04-01T16:59:25  <Stocha> you send waves of ants at the ennemy
2011-04-01T16:59:32  <Stocha> so the combat tend to go for up until the end.
2011-04-01T16:59:51  <Stocha> (well you probably seen that on the ant simulator i showed)
2011-04-01T17:00:21  <phire> yeah, I think you are right
2011-04-01T17:00:34  <Stocha> Or do you mean the formations will break after the first turn ?
2011-04-01T17:00:58  <phire> think about the 3x3 block
2011-04-01T17:01:06  <Stocha> Anyway, studying simple cases on 10x10 maps, is probably the way to start
2011-04-01T17:01:20  <phire> its strong if you attack from the 4 sides
2011-04-01T17:01:23  <Stocha> the other way being to put up some random map, and see how it goes in there.
2011-04-01T17:01:59  <phire> but if you are clever, you can pick away the corners
2011-04-01T17:01:59  <Stocha> 3x3 block is strong and flexible. But costly
2011-04-01T17:02:15  <Stocha> can you ?
2011-04-01T17:02:24  <Stocha> with one ant you mean ?
2011-04-01T17:02:31  <Stocha> or with 4 ?
2011-04-01T17:02:40  <phire> one for each corner
2011-04-01T17:02:44  <Stocha> ah yeah with one ant then.
2011-04-01T17:02:55  <Stocha> yeah the corners are weak there.
2011-04-01T17:03:15  <Stocha> but that would mean you are being attacked diagonally
2011-04-01T17:03:29  <Stocha> wich seems a weird way to get attacked
2011-04-01T17:03:29  <phire> diagonal attacks are alowed
2011-04-01T17:03:37  <Stocha> because diagonal movement is not efficient
2011-04-01T17:03:49  <Stocha> they are allowed, but not easy to set up.
2011-04-01T17:04:04  <Stocha> the radius of attack is pretty short also.
2011-04-01T17:04:12  <phire> I think I can manage
2011-04-01T17:04:23  <phire> it becomes all about setup
2011-04-01T17:04:39  <phire> trying to move all your ants into range at the right turn
2011-04-01T17:04:42  <Stocha> I think i will try very simple formations first anyway.
2011-04-01T17:05:15  <Stocha> but at the moment, i'm not to deeply involved in combat
2011-04-01T17:05:18  <phire> if they work, it will be a nice simple solution
2011-04-01T17:05:25  <Stocha> alghouth i guess the combat rule is pretty settled
2011-04-01T17:05:41  <Stocha> my plan is to build bot incrementally
2011-04-01T17:05:51  <phire> combat will be a lot easier when there are other bots to test it against
2011-04-01T17:06:14  <Stocha> so the question is : will it work agains my previous generations of bots. Those that doesn't care about formations and fighting. Just running mindlessly at the ennemy
2011-04-01T17:06:26  <Stocha> if it does, it is sufficient argument for me to try hard at it :p
2011-04-01T17:06:55  <Stocha> of course the process might be badly flawed, but it is simple to follow. And probably more fun that to try to think hard :p
2011-04-01T17:07:25  <Stocha> i've put a lot of thinking into food gathering. And only got out with a headache. no concrete solutions. No implementation.
2011-04-01T17:07:39  <Stocha> well i guess my next bot will try to improve the food gathering thing a bit.
2011-04-01T17:08:07  <Stocha> i'm trying to get some expressive framework to help me in that goal. It might help for other tasks too. If it work.
2011-04-01T17:09:09  <Stocha> Once there are other bots available for comparison, everything will be more fun. I suppose :p
2011-04-01T17:09:18  <Stocha> we'll need maps although. A lot of them.
2011-04-01T17:09:38  <Stocha> Knowing what kind of map will make it live would be good. Especially the size.
2011-04-01T17:09:43  <phire> of different types
2011-04-01T17:09:59  <Stocha> if map are more than 128 x128 all my bot framework might break out of acceptable speed :p
2011-04-01T17:10:22  <Stocha> i'll have to do it all back again from scratch.
2011-04-01T17:10:25  <phire> I had a few wraping problems
2011-04-01T17:10:40  <Stocha> yeah ?
2011-04-01T17:10:43  <Stocha> what kind ?
2011-04-01T17:11:28  <phire> I expected the mod operator work like: -1 % 100 == 99
2011-04-01T17:11:33  <Stocha> For combat the turn are simultaneous. Unlike chess.
2011-04-01T17:11:39  <Stocha> so you can't do the same sort of planning.
2011-04-01T17:11:47  <Stocha> mixed strategy are probable.
2011-04-01T17:12:00  <Stocha> it works that way.
2011-04-01T17:12:17  <Stocha> you do it (x+100)%100
2011-04-01T17:12:18  <Stocha> :p
2011-04-01T17:12:27  <Stocha> i think i had the same issue though
2011-04-01T17:12:31  <phire> I worked that out
2011-04-01T17:12:35  <Stocha> i don't remember really.
2011-04-01T17:12:49  <Stocha> i think i had that exact -1%100 stuff.
2011-04-01T17:13:15  <phire> I also had some brutal spelling errors
2011-04-01T17:13:21  <phire> that took me hours to debug
2011-04-01T17:13:23  <Stocha> but i'm not sure there is any (x+100)%100 in my code anymore. Maybe deep into the framework there is. I'm not even sure.
2011-04-01T17:13:27  <Stocha> hehe
2011-04-01T17:13:33  <Stocha> it took minutes :p
2011-04-01T17:13:38  <Stocha> java rocks :p
2011-04-01T17:13:53  <Stocha> do you have mean of producing debug output ?
2011-04-01T17:14:01  <phire> they would work 90% of the time
2011-04-01T17:14:15  <Stocha> also to be fair, i made my own server. So i could control everything.
2011-04-01T17:14:35  <phire> I modified the framework to trigger core dumps on a timeout
2011-04-01T17:14:44  <Stocha> loool
2011-04-01T17:14:48  <Stocha> that's nice debug output :p
2011-04-01T17:14:59  <Stocha> so one core dump for a, two for b ?
2011-04-01T17:15:24  <phire> just one dump at a time
2011-04-01T17:15:27  <Stocha> i had both err/std and some graphical output capabilities for debuging.
2011-04-01T17:15:46  <Stocha> yeah multiple dump or not that easy to output :p
2011-04-01T17:15:47  <phire> yeah, I think I'm going to need some graphical debugging at some point
2011-04-01T17:16:00  <Stocha> you might at least go for some file ouput
2011-04-01T17:16:19  <Stocha> i was on the point to do that, when i tryed to plug my bot into the real framework
2011-04-01T17:16:24  <phire> trying to work out what happened from just a core dump can be a little hard
2011-04-01T17:16:41  <Stocha> i had a silly bug : i didn't call the main function. It took me like two hours.  Because i had no mean of outputing anything.
2011-04-01T17:16:58  <phire> lol
2011-04-01T17:17:25  <Stocha> after 2 hours of rereading the code, i finally picked up the fault. So i didn't do file output.
2011-04-01T17:17:42  <Stocha> but i guess for c addict, it is just easy and efficient. With a kind of ascii format
2011-04-01T17:17:56  <Stocha> of course i find ascii really hard to read.
2011-04-01T17:18:14  <phire> the problem I've been having is that printing debugging infomation can effect the timing
2011-04-01T17:18:55  <Stocha> i didn't found anyway to output anything in the real framework. i'm not very comfortable with unix or anything.
2011-04-01T17:19:11  <Stocha> but file output can be pretty fast.
2011-04-01T17:19:18  <Stocha> certainly faster than stderr
2011-04-01T17:19:19  <phire> system.err.println
2011-04-01T17:19:26  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-01T17:19:39  <Stocha> but it doesn't make it to the console
2011-04-01T17:19:50  <Stocha> when i do play_one_game
2011-04-01T17:19:52  <phire> it shows up at the very end
2011-04-01T17:19:59  <Stocha> i can use it with my internal test server though.
2011-04-01T17:20:02  <Stocha> does it ?
2011-04-01T17:20:07  <Stocha> i didn't found it.
2011-04-01T17:20:10  <phire> it does it mine
2011-04-01T17:20:24  <Stocha> i think you can configure the timeout though.
2011-04-01T17:21:05  <Stocha> so you don't get bothered too much when outputing . Although i didn't try to find out how. Because i don't depend on the official thing for debugging.
2011-04-01T17:21:25  <phire> I tried that, my printf was causing a massive spike
2011-04-01T17:21:43  <Stocha> strange.
2011-04-01T17:21:46  <phire> I think I got to the end of a buffer or something
2011-04-01T17:21:59  <Stocha> i had no problem with standard output on my private testings.
2011-04-01T17:22:32  <Stocha> it's not like i'm really short in time, or need a lot of output also.
2011-04-01T17:22:55  <Stocha> do you plan to win ?
2011-04-01T17:23:19  <Stocha> i mean, i came here to see if i could win the game. I'm not that confident now :p
2011-04-01T17:23:33  <Stocha> it seems quite some work to do it seriously.
2011-04-01T17:23:47  <phire> I'm hoping for the top in my country
2011-04-01T17:24:15  <phire> which shouldn't be hard
2011-04-01T17:24:34  <Stocha> i guess being at the top will requires some complex pieces of software. I wonder if i can handle that. I prefer things to be simple really :p
2011-04-01T17:24:44  <Stocha> what kind of country would that be ? :p
2011-04-01T17:24:47  <phire> I think New Zealead had 30 entries last time
2011-04-01T17:25:09  <Stocha> i don't know how many france had. I suppose they had quite some good one though.
2011-04-01T17:25:36  <Stocha> isn't 30 a lot ? if they are top guys.
2011-04-01T17:26:16  <Stocha> i have to go against 30 good guys spending quite some work, i'm not confident i'll have it easy.

2011-04-01T17:27:16  <Stocha> ii don't know what it takes to really make a difference though.
2011-04-01T17:27:35  <Stocha> i never participated in any competition.

2011-04-01T17:29:08  <phire> France might be hard: http://ai-contest.com/country_profile.php?country_id=82
2011-04-01T17:29:27  <phire> 7 people in the top 100
2011-04-01T17:29:49  <Stocha> first one was using python ! :p
2011-04-01T17:30:12  <Stocha> i will not be happy if python plunge my little thing
2011-04-01T17:30:19  <Stocha> i'm so worried about speed really :p
2011-04-01T17:30:41  <Stocha> but planet wars doesn't seems to have been hard on computing power for top bots.
2011-04-01T17:30:45  <Stocha> somehow
2011-04-01T17:31:14  <Stocha> that's why i concluded that i had to have some nice understanding of the ant games first.
2011-04-01T17:31:19  <phire> yeah
2011-04-01T17:31:37  <Stocha> going as fast as i could, not worrying too much about anything :p
2011-04-01T17:31:39  <phire> I think planet wars was easy
2011-04-01T17:32:22  <Stocha> easy on computer power, doesn't mean that winning bots had simple architectures and low coupling components :p
2011-04-01T17:32:49  <Stocha> seeing that functionnal had the lead, it might be the reverse.
2011-04-01T17:32:53  <Stocha> i wonder how ant will go.
2011-04-01T17:33:10  <phire> there is a reason I chose c
2011-04-01T17:33:13  <Stocha> will complex rules rules. Or will tree solvers be the way to go ? probably a bit of both.
2011-04-01T17:33:24  <Stocha> what reason is it you chose c ?
2011-04-01T17:33:42  <phire> I wanted that extra processing power
2011-04-01T17:33:57  <Stocha> it's always good to have.
2011-04-01T17:34:01  <phire> my next choice would be python
2011-04-01T17:34:11  <Stocha> but wanting to have it might do some real damage to your engine :p
2011-04-01T17:34:19  <Stocha> are you confortable with python ?
2011-04-01T17:34:28  <Stocha> how does python compares to c ?
2011-04-01T17:34:46  <Stocha> i know from experience that sometime java can compare acceptably with c.
2011-04-01T17:35:04  <phire> it depends on how well you design the algorithm
2011-04-01T17:35:13  <Stocha> (not when you really need those extra few milliseconds obvioulsy but well)
2011-04-01T17:35:22  <Stocha> let's suppose you have the same algorithm
2011-04-01T17:35:31  <Stocha> what factor can you expect beteween c and python ?
2011-04-01T17:35:39  <Stocha> c and java might be like x2
2011-04-01T17:35:51  <phire> it depends a lot on the algrothem
2011-04-01T17:36:09  <Stocha> but i don't know if i'll produce c code good enough to get the x2 from c :p
2011-04-01T17:36:20  <Stocha> some algo are fast in python and some very slow ?
2011-04-01T17:36:24  <phire> I know form experence, c is 20x faster than python when you touch each byte in a long string and xor it with another string
2011-04-01T17:36:58  <Stocha> now that's quite a motivation for going c rather than python then :p
2011-04-01T17:37:28  <Stocha> with java i have much lower ratio, to be sure. But i don't know what it will be like on the server machine. C is more easy to plan for.
2011-04-01T17:37:37  <phire> but a good algrothem should be 2-5 times slower, if you use numpy
2011-04-01T17:37:44  <Stocha> i though : if it goes really wrong, i'll make a duplicate in c.
2011-04-01T17:37:57  <Stocha> numpy ?
2011-04-01T17:38:16  <phire> its a library for dealing with numbers and arrays better
2011-04-01T17:39:00  <Stocha> So my plan is to test idea in java. And if i really need speed, i'll try to build something in c.
2011-04-01T17:39:33  <phire> I've heard that java can get upto 80% of the performance of c
2011-04-01T17:39:39  <Stocha> java has cool naming spaces.
2011-04-01T17:39:52  <Stocha> well i did a GoBot once.
2011-04-01T17:39:57  <Stocha> a friend optimized it.
2011-04-01T17:40:00  <Stocha> in java still.
2011-04-01T17:40:06  <Stocha> i translated it in c.
2011-04-01T17:40:11  <Stocha> and obtains i think no gain.
2011-04-01T17:40:43  <Stocha> it was like 20 000 simulations/sec proc in java, and the same in c.
2011-04-01T17:40:55  <phire> I bet someone could optimise it again in c and get another 10%\
2011-04-01T17:41:18  <Stocha> but good c simulator where like 80 000 simulations/sec
2011-04-01T17:41:26  *** p4p4p5 <p4p4p5!~chatzilla@82.113.106.30> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [SeaMonkey 2.0a3/20090223135443])
2011-04-01T17:41:59  <Stocha> but you might have to know what your are doing. And also i could took up some time.
2011-04-01T17:42:02  <phire> at some point you have to start thinking about the asm code that c will generate
2011-04-01T17:42:23  <Stocha> So java sounds okay for prototyping. It is flexible. And you have great graphical lib at hand.
2011-04-01T17:42:25  <phire> and how the data structures will fit into the cache
2011-04-01T17:42:28  <Stocha> and some others also.
2011-04-01T17:42:43  <phire> I would be a little worried about the garbage collector
2011-04-01T17:43:01  <Stocha> I totally didn't understood processors
2011-04-01T17:43:18  <Stocha> it seems so complicated, random and model specific :p
2011-04-01T17:43:25  <phire> very
2011-04-01T17:43:45  <Stocha> i made some optimizations that where like +1% on my proc. and +20% on the amd a friend had
2011-04-01T17:43:59  <Stocha> so his optimization where good for my machine. And mine for his.
2011-04-01T17:44:10  <phire> lol
2011-04-01T17:44:11  <Stocha> total madness.
2011-04-01T17:44:26  <Stocha> so i guess i'll go for -O3 or whatever java -server stuff
2011-04-01T17:44:42  <Stocha> although i don't have control over what java vm they'll run i guess
2011-04-01T17:44:43  <phire> my code was crashing with -O3
2011-04-01T17:44:52  <Stocha> your bot here ?
2011-04-01T17:44:58  <phire> yeah
2011-04-01T17:44:59  <Stocha> that doesn't sound good. :p
2011-04-01T17:45:06  <Stocha> i don't think i managed to that
2011-04-01T17:45:08  <phire> I think I fixed the bug
2011-04-01T17:45:21  <Stocha> unless you do some nasty wright outside of boundaries
2011-04-01T17:45:34  <Stocha> which c is very efficient and practical for doing
2011-04-01T17:45:46  <phire> it was probally that one were I was still using data that had been freed already
2011-04-01T17:45:48  <Stocha> that might be why i never did a c program that behaved right.
2011-04-01T17:46:17  <Stocha> so -03 is better core dump proofed.
2011-04-01T17:46:33  <Stocha> really java is good for this. You go for index out of bound exception.
2011-04-01T17:46:39  <Stocha> rather than random bugs :p
2011-04-01T17:46:47  <phire> -03 made things hard to debug
2011-04-01T17:46:54  <Stocha> practical for prototyping.
2011-04-01T17:47:01  <phire> it kept optimising out all the varables
2011-04-01T17:47:05  <Stocha> how do -03 make things hard to debug ?
2011-04-01T17:47:15  <Stocha> i think i didn't used a debugger in 20 years.
2011-04-01T17:47:35  <Stocha> debuggers are really for when you are hacking through unfriendly code.
2011-04-01T17:47:44  <Stocha> wich i tend to rarely do lately.

2011-04-01T17:48:21  <Stocha> were
2011-04-01T17:49:08  <phire> I actually found one of my typos when I was looking at the assembly output
2011-04-01T17:49:12  <Stocha> debuggers are not good really :p
2011-04-01T17:49:48  <phire> I could do with more exprence in gdb
2011-04-01T17:50:05  <Stocha> i haven't done serious C in years. And i think i didn't use disassembly to much in the past.
2011-04-01T17:50:19  <Stocha> What i use a lot are debugoutputs
2011-04-01T17:50:23  <Stocha> like printf :p
2011-04-01T17:50:40  <Stocha> or i build a framework altogethere
2011-04-01T17:50:42  <phire> yeah, I use a lot of them
2011-04-01T17:51:11  <Stocha> they are -O3 proof. Most of the time; When they aren't, something really nasty is happening - like compiler trouble
2011-04-01T17:51:30  <Stocha> sometime you have trouble commenting them off though :p
2011-04-01T17:52:04  <Stocha> i guess i should work or sleep. I'm probably in no condition to produce some worthy code though.

2011-04-01T17:53:18  <phire> yeah, south east
2011-04-01T17:54:28  <Stocha> it won ? :p
2011-04-01T17:54:45  <phire> number of ants, but not points
2011-04-01T17:55:05  <phire> not supprising, because it doesn't try to attack
2011-04-01T17:55:50  <Stocha> what were the opponents ?
2011-04-01T17:56:02  <Stocha> if they try to attack that would suffice in most cases.
2011-04-01T17:56:44  <phire> 2 hunter bots to the west
2011-04-01T17:57:07  <phire> north east was "Lefty" who just sticks to the left wall
2011-04-01T17:57:34  <Stocha> so just gobling up food is enougth to keep the hunters bots in check then.
2011-04-01T17:57:43  <Stocha> i felt my bot had trouble with them :p
2011-04-01T17:58:15  <Stocha> although the three died ultimately. on this map. The map is well straight forward.
2011-04-01T17:58:30  <Stocha> i think it took 282 for the bot to win.
2011-04-01T17:58:46  <Stocha> i guess he was loosing for most of the game.
2011-04-01T17:58:55  <Stocha> up until it defeated the two first bots
2011-04-01T17:59:05  <Stocha> the third one was leading on the score i think.
2011-04-01T18:00:05  <Stocha> good night then :p
2011-04-01T18:00:06  <phire> its a shame that the bots don't get live scoring infomation so they can decide who to go after
2011-04-01T18:00:09  <phire> night
2011-04-01T18:00:26  <Stocha> they don't see the map anyway
2011-04-01T18:00:34  <Stocha> how would knowing the score really help ?
2011-04-01T18:00:43  <Stocha> the need to see the map really :)
2011-04-01T18:01:01  <phire> not sure
2011-04-01T18:01:04  <phire> anyway sleeping
