2012-06-26T09:34:58  <mcstar> delt0r: no, thats the reason we wont meet XD
2012-06-26T09:35:06  <delt0r> just had a power cut... first time i booted this machine in 15 months
2012-06-26T09:35:21  <delt0r> mcstar: your confusing me
2012-06-26T09:35:39  <delt0r> not that its difficulty to do that
2012-06-26T09:35:48  <mcstar> :)
2012-06-26T09:36:16  <delt0r> I was also wondering if there was any progress with "reorganizing" the organization that is aichallange
2012-06-26T09:36:19  <mcstar> delt0r: not much was happening to the contest since jeff last appeared
2012-06-26T09:36:41  <mcstar> it was ~2 months ago
2012-06-26T09:36:43  <delt0r> in other words i am asking if anyone has got a hold of jeff
2012-06-26T09:37:24  <delt0r> He needs to agree to let his baby leave home
2012-06-26T09:37:32  <mcstar> probably
2012-06-26T09:38:10  <delt0r> in other words he is not around enough... there is a lot of people that want to see a bit more pace than "we don't know what is happening next"
2012-06-26T09:38:21  <delt0r> and since he is not around... why are we waiting for him?
2012-06-26T09:38:23  <mcstar> absolutely
2012-06-26T09:38:37  <mcstar> but he brought the funding so far
2012-06-26T09:38:40  <mcstar> thats one reason i recon
2012-06-26T09:38:56  <delt0r> he who has the gold makes the rules
2012-06-26T09:39:08  <delt0r> how much funding is needed?
2012-06-26T09:39:19  <mcstar> idk
2012-06-26T09:39:25  <delt0r> I still think getting a uni on board would not be difficult...
2012-06-26T09:39:44  <delt0r> use the spare cluster cycles... or even get some allocated
2012-06-26T09:40:17  <delt0r> I am moving to Switzerland next year. I know i will be there for at least 4 years..
2012-06-26T09:40:49  <delt0r> So I am prepared to be a bit more stable with perhaps doing something more tangible than just code...
2012-06-26T09:42:49  <delt0r> not that code is not tangible...
2012-06-26T09:43:18  <mcstar> i was thinking about that, and came to the conclusion it isnt, except in mission critical applications
2012-06-26T09:43:53  <delt0r> you mean code is not tangible..
2012-06-26T09:43:57  <mcstar> yeah
2012-06-26T09:44:22  <mcstar> maybe if you print it in braille...
2012-06-26T09:44:27  <delt0r> well then my job involve lots of intangible productivity
2012-06-26T09:44:42  <mcstar> yeah
2012-06-26T09:44:51  <mcstar> and not just code is like that
2012-06-26T09:45:01  <delt0r> case in point my new job will involve a lot more data work
2012-06-26T09:45:32  <delt0r> like real data, HIV and influenza and stuff like that
2012-06-26T09:45:43  <mcstar> exciting
2012-06-26T09:45:48  <delt0r> I am
2012-06-26T09:45:54  <delt0r> good lab to work with
2012-06-26T09:45:59  <delt0r> good pay too
2012-06-26T09:46:09  <delt0r> well for science anyway
2012-06-26T09:47:44  <mcstar> have you moved your family to switzerland yet?
2012-06-26T09:47:51  <delt0r> so anyway you talked to jeff 2 months ago? how did that go? anything to report (don't want to go over the logs)
2012-06-26T09:48:03  <delt0r> mcstar: no... we move in Dec/Jan
2012-06-26T09:48:06  <mcstar> not me
2012-06-26T09:48:29  <delt0r> oh... thought you where in canada?
2012-06-26T09:48:32  <delt0r> like jeff
2012-06-26T09:48:39  <mcstar> im in hungary
2012-06-26T09:48:49  <mcstar> and im not an organizer :)
2012-06-26T09:48:50  <delt0r> oh... well another EU person
2012-06-26T09:48:59  <delt0r> but are any of us?
2012-06-26T09:49:37  <delt0r> Hungary is nice --we have been to Budapest a few times
2012-06-26T09:49:45  <delt0r> like the food
2012-06-26T09:49:58  <mcstar> well, amstan rossignol scott and jeff are the core
2012-06-26T09:49:59  <mcstar> afaik
2012-06-26T09:50:00  <delt0r> not so different from Austria however
2012-06-26T09:50:08  <delt0r> Right
2012-06-26T09:50:18  <delt0r> do you know if any progress was made?
2012-06-26T09:50:47  <mcstar> they agreed to talk more seriously again
2012-06-26T09:50:51  <mcstar> but that never happened
2012-06-26T09:50:58  <delt0r> Oh god
2012-06-26T09:51:30  <delt0r> of course not... because they could have done it then and it was delayed... the infinite delay
2012-06-26T09:52:16  <delt0r> What i don't get is why is this aichallenge so popular compared to others?
2012-06-26T09:52:32  <delt0r> because google is in the name?
2012-06-26T09:52:52  <mcstar> is it popular?
2012-06-26T09:53:03  <delt0r> well compared to others
2012-06-26T09:53:05  <delt0r> yes
2012-06-26T09:53:11  <mcstar> it attracts a lot of newbies
2012-06-26T09:53:22  <mcstar> the entry barrier is low
2012-06-26T09:53:37  <delt0r> its quite a lot of entries... and if it was consistent with 2 per year it would get a lot bigger
2012-06-26T09:54:22  <mcstar> afaik, it needs more advertising
2012-06-26T09:54:25  <mcstar> not afaik
2012-06-26T09:54:29  <mcstar> imho
2012-06-26T09:54:38  <mcstar> ofc, not now
2012-06-26T09:54:39  <delt0r> it is also perhaps the most language diverse
2012-06-26T09:54:52  <mcstar> yeah, thats a great plus
2012-06-26T09:55:03  <delt0r> yea.. perhaps... but without more resources i think more entries would be bad
2012-06-26T09:55:30  <delt0r> that or pick a challenge that does not need so much cpu and servers etc
2012-06-26T09:56:17  <mcstar> i have quite a lot to do, so i wont be the one pushing the challenge forward
2012-06-26T09:56:29  <mcstar> though ill try to help if i can
2012-06-26T09:56:38  <pairofdice> AI challenge was easy to get into
2012-06-26T09:56:48  <delt0r> a lot of us are in that boat mcstar
2012-06-26T09:56:51  <pairofdice> It was simple and fun

2012-06-26T10:00:06  <pairofdice> roughly 1% of the shots turned out decent
2012-06-26T10:00:20  <delt0r> yea these days just getting more people interested is probably pretty good advertising via g+ and facebook etc

2012-06-26T13:44:37  <mcstar> with 1 cycle
2012-06-26T13:44:41  <mcstar> but lets erase that
2012-06-26T13:44:58  <mcstar> ofc, the conjecture is that notwithstanding that cycle, there is no other
2012-06-26T13:45:12  <mcstar> and all the natural numbers appear as vertices
2012-06-26T13:46:00  <n4nd0> hi all, I wonder if there has already been something talked about or planned for the next ai challenge
2012-06-26T13:46:07  <n4nd0> like dates or the topic
2012-06-26T13:46:10  <mcstar> no

2012-06-26T13:49:53  <mcstar> well, his nick is 13345p34k, and you purposefull changed the 4 to 3 to make it funny
2012-06-26T13:50:08  <antimatroid> okay, let's go with that :P
2012-06-26T13:50:13  <antimatroid> and not blame the time
2012-06-26T13:50:26  <antimatroid> (it's 3:50am and i've been marking exams :()

2012-06-26T13:50:48  <mcstar> great, and in the meantime, you forgot about the beloved Tab key
2012-06-26T13:50:54  <mcstar> np
2012-06-26T13:51:11  <antimatroid> i usually only use tab for long names
2012-06-26T13:51:16  <antimatroid> or if i want to see if someone i know is in the channel
2012-06-26T13:51:37  <antimatroid> before i bombard a nic which isn't even here aha
2012-06-26T13:51:59  <mcstar> antimatroid: i dont like mixing letters with numbers when i type
2012-06-26T13:52:13  <mcstar> so even for short names, i tab till it finds the right one
2012-06-26T13:52:16  <antimatroid> it certainly slows me down
2012-06-26T13:52:21  <antimatroid> i have to look at the keyboard
2012-06-26T13:52:46  <antimatroid> if i tab on m it just gives me a list of 4 names
2012-06-26T13:53:01  <mcstar> mine cycles through
2012-06-26T13:53:01  <antimatroid> i have to keep going till it can get a unique match for tab to actually put the username in for me
2012-06-26T13:53:11  <antimatroid> pesky pidgeon, i prefer yours
2012-06-26T13:53:20  <antimatroid> 5* names

2012-06-26T15:07:41  <mcstar> what is a bana consumption?
2012-06-26T15:08:11  <mcstar> (otherwise its funny)
2012-06-26T15:08:15  <Zannick> x_b obviously
2012-06-26T15:10:20  <mcstar> x_b denotes the optimal bana consumption, but it does not answer what is a bana consumption
2012-06-26T15:10:38  <mcstar> you joker
2012-06-26T15:16:37  <Zannick> right, so since x_b is the optimal bana consumption, it is *a* bana consumption
