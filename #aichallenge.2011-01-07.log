2011-01-07T22:29:00  <antimatroid> amstan_: how's the progress coming along?
2011-01-07T22:29:06  <amstan_> well
2011-01-07T22:29:11  <amstan_> we have some ieas
2011-01-07T22:29:14  <amstan_> ideas*
2011-01-07T22:29:29  <antimatroid> i'm going camping for 6 days tomorrow, then going away for another week at the end of january, otherwise i'll have some time to do stuff
2011-01-07T22:29:44  <amstan_> we are thinking of not doing stuff from scratch yet
2011-01-07T22:29:57  <amstan_> launch another contest asap, with the structure we have now
2011-01-07T22:30:06  <amstan_> nothing much being changed
2011-01-07T22:30:14  <amstan_> that wouldn't take much maintenance either
2011-01-07T22:30:26  <amstan_> while we concentrate on coding the backend at the same time
2011-01-07T22:30:29  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2011-01-07T22:30:36  <antimatroid> there are a few things that i think should change
2011-01-07T22:30:46  <antimatroid> that don't require a full rewrite of everything
2011-01-07T22:30:46  <amstan_> so... things we have to do for that:
2011-01-07T22:30:57  <amstan_> -new site
2011-01-07T22:31:07  <amstan_> -pick a game
2011-01-07T22:31:24  <amstan_> issue is that ants should be more than 2 players at once
2011-01-07T22:31:29  <antimatroid> delt0r: how's your game coming along?
2011-01-07T22:31:41  <antimatroid> why do you want ants to be more than 2 player?
2011-01-07T22:31:50  <amstan_> and we don't really have a multi player rankings system
2011-01-07T22:32:02  <antimatroid> people have been playing around with trueskill
2011-01-07T22:32:11  <antimatroid> that will do multiplayer rankings
2011-01-07T22:32:18  <antimatroid> well, as far as i've been told anyway
2011-01-07T22:32:24  <amstan_> well.. is it ok to use though?
2011-01-07T22:32:27  <amstan_> how open is it?
2011-01-07T22:32:36  <antimatroid> dmj111: you about?
2011-01-07T22:33:07  <antimatroid> i don't know much about it myself, but it seems open enough for others to use it
2011-01-07T22:33:28  <amstan_> ok
2011-01-07T22:33:36  <amstan_> but it'll still require implementing
2011-01-07T22:33:40  <antimatroid> i would expect rankings to be even less stable though
2011-01-07T22:34:03  <antimatroid> personally i think 2 player games are still sufficiently hard that n>2 isn't really needed
2011-01-07T22:34:18  <amstan_> so... implement ants, implement trueskill, add new content for the site, make a visualizer, make starter packages
2011-01-07T22:34:23  <antimatroid> it would be nice at some point, but if you're in a hurry to get the next contest going, possibly better to wait?
2011-01-07T22:34:56  <amstan_> ants could get more potential with multiplayer
2011-01-07T22:35:02  <amstan_> jeff has a simplified version
2011-01-07T22:35:04  <antimatroid> yeah, it does sound cool
2011-01-07T22:35:20  <antimatroid> is he running with the home base idea?
2011-01-07T22:35:25  <amstan_> no..
2011-01-07T22:35:29  <antimatroid> that's my favourite part of ants
2011-01-07T22:35:45  <amstan_> you get an ant... there's food points all over, they spawn during the game too
2011-01-07T22:35:47  *** Cold-Phoenix <Cold-Phoenix!~Cold-Phoe@33.58.113.87.dyn.plus.net> has quit IRC ()
2011-01-07T22:35:59  <amstan_> if an ant comes to a food, the food gets converted to another ant
2011-01-07T22:36:08  <amstan_> when 2 enemy ants meet, they both die
2011-01-07T22:36:12  <antimatroid> so it's just seek, destroy and multiply?
2011-01-07T22:36:16  <amstan_> yep
2011-01-07T22:36:25  <antimatroid> i like the idea of having to try and invade/defend bases
2011-01-07T22:36:30  <amstan_> no need
2011-01-07T22:36:41  <amstan_> the idea then will be.. to controll the biggest area
2011-01-07T22:36:47  <amstan_> that way you'll always have more food
2011-01-07T22:36:55  <amstan_> since it keeps spawning
2011-01-07T22:37:23  <antimatroid> that's easier said than done when you can't see the whole map, have to defend etc.
2011-01-07T22:37:37  <amstan_> yep
2011-01-07T22:37:48  <amstan_> that's why it's a good idea
2011-01-07T22:38:05  <amstan_> but issue is that multiplayer will be better
2011-01-07T22:38:08  <antimatroid> wait, what? you just said you aren't running with it :P
2011-01-07T22:38:13  <antimatroid> you can do multiplayer with home bases
2011-01-07T22:38:32  <amstan_> link?
2011-01-07T22:38:43  <antimatroid> there is no link
2011-01-07T22:38:44  <Zannick> the home base thing as the visualizer showed seemed kinda clunky to me
2011-01-07T22:38:58  <antimatroid> Zannick: too many ants? that was done because the ai was really shit
2011-01-07T22:38:59  <Zannick> as in you had to deposit food to it to make ants
2011-01-07T22:39:02  <amstan_> does it require an ant per process?
2011-01-07T22:39:11  <amstan_> process per ant*
2011-01-07T22:39:21  <antimatroid> amstan_: you can't do a process per ant, too much overhead
2011-01-07T22:39:29  <amstan_> yeah.. so.. is it or not?
2011-01-07T22:39:34  <antimatroid> no
2011-01-07T22:39:38  <Zannick> that's fairly ridiculous anyhow, you can simulate that with one process
2011-01-07T22:39:46  <antimatroid> Zannick: not really
2011-01-07T22:39:54  <Zannick> it's useful when you can't simulate it, ie. real life
2011-01-07T22:40:10  <amstan_> Zannick: the idea is to stop them from communicating
2011-01-07T22:40:16  <antimatroid> if you have a single process, each of your ants has the same information
2011-01-07T22:40:23  <Zannick> amstan_: ah
2011-01-07T22:40:34  <Zannick> that's...
2011-01-07T22:40:39  <Zannick> that's not a game with ants anymore
2011-01-07T22:40:41  <antimatroid> even if you pass relative information, they all know what the other knows, and it just becomes a pattern matching exercise at the start
2011-01-07T22:41:01  <amstan_> Zannick: no.. if we wanted to make it cool we would have done that, each ant thinks for itself
2011-01-07T22:41:06  <amstan_> but that's too much overhead
2011-01-07T22:41:18  <antimatroid> there would have been ways for the ants to communicate
2011-01-07T22:41:20  <amstan_> so it has to be a hive mind, all ants of the same team will have to be one process
2011-01-07T22:41:26  <antimatroid> but it would have been like a max length string or something
2011-01-07T22:42:16  <amstan_> we also have to look for sponsors
2011-01-07T22:42:17  <antimatroid> amstan_: what do you mean when you see ants both die when they come across each other?
2011-01-07T22:42:30  <amstan_> antimatroid: 2 ants meet, they both dissapear!
2011-01-07T22:42:40  <antimatroid> is that if they land on the same square? what if more than 2 ants land there? all dead?
2011-01-07T22:42:51  <antimatroid> it's also giving no real attack strategy
2011-01-07T22:42:56  <amstan_> distance smaller than epsilon
2011-01-07T22:43:05  <amstan_> if more than 2.. they get paired
2011-01-07T22:43:30  <antimatroid> it's pretty much 0 payoff to each of you from losing an ant, cause they lost exactly the same thing, whereas if you let ants attack adjacent squares, some ants can run away while others surround and take them out
2011-01-07T22:43:32  <Zannick> 2 allied ant?
2011-01-07T22:43:43  <amstan_> not really
2011-01-07T22:43:53  <Zannick> 4 allied and 1 enemy?
2011-01-07T22:44:18  <Zannick> oh, that's contrived, if this is a square grid
2011-01-07T22:44:21  <amstan_> Zannick: 2 ants of the same team.. nothing happens, they'll both survive
2011-01-07T22:44:30  <antimatroid> so ants can stack?
2011-01-07T22:44:54  <amstan_> ok.. if n blue ants meet m red ants... n-m blue ants survive
2011-01-07T22:44:58  <Zannick> i'm not really confident in this game
2011-01-07T22:45:02  <amstan_> no.. they don't stack..
2011-01-07T22:45:26  <antimatroid> tbh, neither am i, i'm not sure the games would be particularly interesting
2011-01-07T22:45:28  <amstan_> actually.. jeff has a simulation
2011-01-07T22:45:54  <dmj111> hey... I am reading through the conversation at the moment.
2011-01-07T22:46:14  <antimatroid> dmj111: main question is about how hard it would be to set up multiplayer rankings with trueskill
2011-01-07T22:47:00  <antimatroid> amstan_: definitely talk to Frontier about an official visualiser if ants is followed through with
2011-01-07T22:47:49  <amstan_> @later tell Frontier Hang around, we might need your help doing an ants visualizer for the next contest.
2011-01-07T22:47:49  <contestbot> amstan_: Yep.
2011-01-07T22:48:08  <amstan_> another contest option is that 3vs3 tron
2011-01-07T22:48:13  <amstan_> that jmcarthur suggested
2011-01-07T22:48:29  <dmj111> the multiplayer trueskill is far hairier than single player.  there is a pretty open source C# implementation, I believe.
2011-01-07T22:48:29  <amstan_> we can keep bayeselo for that
2011-01-07T22:48:32  <antimatroid> i'm not ver interested in doing another tron contest, but i could be in the minority
2011-01-07T22:49:00  <Zannick> i'm not very interested in ants, but i could be in the minority
2011-01-07T22:49:04  <antimatroid> :P
2011-01-07T22:49:20  <dmj111> using it also requires ordering all finishers, first through last.
2011-01-07T22:49:27  <antimatroid> although sigh sparked a cool idea with me for tron a few months ago
2011-01-07T22:49:29  <amstan_> though.. we might get sued by disney if we become bigger and we do tron
2011-01-07T22:49:32  <antimatroid> could be semi fun to implement
2011-01-07T22:50:04  <Zannick> i'm pretty sure fair use, etc. etc.
2011-01-07T22:50:19  <antimatroid> i'm going to do a complete 180 here
2011-01-07T22:50:32  <antimatroid> i actually think i'd have fun implementing that tron idea, but i still feel some might not go for the repeat
2011-01-07T22:51:07  <Zannick> i think that eventually as we do more and more games that we'll either need to invent new ones every time or repeat some
2011-01-07T22:51:18  <amstan_> imagine the other guys who came too late for tron though...
2011-01-07T22:51:19  <Zannick> the problem with inventing games is determining a proper balance
2011-01-07T22:51:32  <Zannick> and making it interesting
2011-01-07T22:54:19  <antimatroid> with tron, would nvn be better than 3v3?
2011-01-07T22:54:33  <amstan_> 3 seems cooler
2011-01-07T22:55:03  <Zannick> 3 is a high enough n to be cool while being a low enough number to be feasible
2011-01-07T22:55:22  <amstan_> ya, lol
2011-01-07T22:55:41  <antimatroid> are edges going to be wrapped?
2011-01-07T22:55:57  <amstan_> no
2011-01-07T22:56:00  <Zannick> as opposed to walling off edges?
2011-01-07T22:56:05  <antimatroid> yep
2011-01-07T22:56:27  <antimatroid> my ants map gen can easily be converted to make maps for something like that
2011-01-07T22:57:53  <antimatroid> i think 3v3 tron would be more interesting strategy wise than the above described ants game
2011-01-07T23:01:32  <dmj111> 3v3 tron certainly seems interesting.   What I wonder is if there is something obvious hidden there that we won't realize until games are played.
2011-01-07T23:02:20  <dmj111> But I have no clue where to even start for a decent idea.
2011-01-07T23:02:20  <amstan_> like?
2011-01-07T23:03:03  <dmj111> the biggest thing, i guess, is once it is 3v2, is it too easy?  maybe not, because of space restrictions of multiple bikes.
2011-01-07T23:04:02  <dmj111> this is just me putting unedited thoughts out there.
2011-01-07T23:04:02  <sigh> if I understand this right, then once seperated the best thing to do is kill off all but one bike?
2011-01-07T23:05:03  <amstan_> a bike's walls died off with the bike
2011-01-07T23:05:11  <sigh> ah
2011-01-07T23:05:18  <amstan_> so that might unseparate you
2011-01-07T23:05:21  <dmj111> yep.
2011-01-07T23:05:29  <sigh> that gives even more reason that you might suicide
2011-01-07T23:05:41  <sigh> that gets very tricky
2011-01-07T23:05:46  <antimatroid> i would have thought it's better to have a wall stay a wall
2011-01-07T23:05:56  <antimatroid> it makes the game easier, which is already quite complicated
2011-01-07T23:06:06  <antimatroid> i have a few ideas
2011-01-07T23:06:09  <antimatroid> i'm down :P
2011-01-07T23:06:44  <sigh> walls disappearing makes the state update more expensive which makes search harder, that's for sure
2011-01-07T23:06:58  <sigh> so you are skewing it towards heuristics again
2011-01-07T23:07:42  <Zannick> well, without that each node has only 3^6 children
2011-01-07T23:07:56  <amstan_> 4
2011-01-07T23:08:03  <Zannick> heck, each node has at most 3^6 children anyway
2011-01-07T23:08:06  <amstan_> since you can now suicide
2011-01-07T23:08:17  <Zannick> by doing a 180?
2011-01-07T23:08:22  <amstan_> yes
2011-01-07T23:08:25  <Zannick> :<
2011-01-07T23:08:27  <Zannick> 4^6
2011-01-07T23:08:39  <dmj111> i guess the hope is that a heuristic favoring game might lead to cooler ideas, while a brute force game is just a brute.
2011-01-07T23:08:44  <Zannick> that's easier to calculate anyway, it's 2^12 which is 4096
2011-01-07T23:08:56  <antimatroid> to hard and you can't get anything interesting done in time
2011-01-07T23:08:59  <antimatroid> too*
2011-01-07T23:09:02  <sigh> dmj111: too much each way is not good , I think
2011-01-07T23:09:04  <Zannick> which is much smaller than the 122 choose 22 planet wars started with
2011-01-07T23:09:35  <dmj111> sigh: ah.  i see.
2011-01-07T23:09:43  <sigh> where did you get 122 choose 22 from?
2011-01-07T23:09:48  <sigh> dmj111: what do you see?
2011-01-07T23:10:01  <antimatroid> if you have 3v3, max turns for each player on first turn is 12, 9 after that
2011-01-07T23:10:04  <dmj111> your point about too much either way.
2011-01-07T23:10:09  <sigh> :)
2011-01-07T23:10:12  <amstan_> antimatroid: nope..
2011-01-07T23:10:14  <antimatroid> that's large enough that you aren't going to really get away with a basic minimax tree
2011-01-07T23:10:17  <Zannick> 100 ships, 23 planets, each possible set of orders allocates that 100 ships among the 23 planets
2011-01-07T23:10:25  <amstan_> antimatroid: for each bike you havea a choice to turn 180 and suicide
2011-01-07T23:10:35  <Zannick> the formula for allocating k among n is (k+n-1) choose (n-1)
2011-01-07T23:10:40  <amstan_> antimatroid: it's just been regarded invalid in the last game since it makes you loose the game
2011-01-07T23:10:44  <amstan_> antimatroid: but not for 3v4
2011-01-07T23:10:46  <amstan_> 3v3*
2011-01-07T23:10:53  <antimatroid> fair point
2011-01-07T23:11:07  <antimatroid> i would probably only consider that if i decided to kill one off
2011-01-07T23:11:18  <antimatroid> but i guess you would want to with close range combat
2011-01-07T23:11:23  <Zannick> i think it would be more interesting if you had to drive into a wall to suicide
2011-01-07T23:11:27  <sigh> Zannick: ah, yeah... and that's just first move :P
2011-01-07T23:11:32  <Zannick> rather than make it an option at any point
2011-01-07T23:11:35  <antimatroid> Zannick: that is diving into a wall :P
2011-01-07T23:11:57  <amstan_> Zannick: you need 2 more turns then, but possible
2011-01-07T23:12:03  <Zannick> antimatroid: that kind of movement doesn't make sense in the actual game
2011-01-07T23:12:15  <sigh> I agree... 180 degree turn doesn't seem like something the bikes can do
2011-01-07T23:12:15  <Zannick> amstan_: yeah
2011-01-07T23:12:20  <antimatroid> neither does a 90 degree turn
2011-01-07T23:12:33  <Zannick> 90 degree turn is all they do
2011-01-07T23:12:42  <antimatroid> no turning?
2011-01-07T23:12:44  <amstan_> Zannick: it does.. imagine you're on the lightcycle ala the new movie, and you just loose controll of the bike and crash
2011-01-07T23:12:52  * Zannick hasn't seen the new movie
2011-01-07T23:12:52  <antimatroid> in this it just goes straight across
2011-01-07T23:12:53  <Zannick> :P
2011-01-07T23:13:06  <Zannick> i'm thinking of the old one, you know, *Tron*
2011-01-07T23:13:10  <amstan_> Zannick: neither did i, just think of a bike going very fast..
2011-01-07T23:13:33  <Zannick> i think in the end we abstract away enough...
2011-01-07T23:13:45  <antimatroid> hmm, i kind of like the idea of walls disappearing
2011-01-07T23:13:56  <antimatroid> completely changes up the game though
2011-01-07T23:14:15  <Zannick> that's good! :D
2011-01-07T23:16:00  <dmj111> the visibility calculations may be fun to do :)  unless they are limited distance, I guess, then it would be easier.
2011-01-07T23:16:24  <antimatroid> what would the visualiser do?
2011-01-07T23:16:24  <dmj111> not hard, just not as  simple as the previous engines.
2011-01-07T23:16:30  <antimatroid> separate shade of wall colour for each snake?
2011-01-07T23:16:43  <sigh> that makes the most sense
2011-01-07T23:16:45  <amstan_> yeah, we could have that
2011-01-07T23:17:41  <dmj111> mini - rant ... i could almost watch planetwars on my black and white kindle.  using shades for the bikes will never work there !!
2011-01-07T23:17:45  <dmj111> :)
2011-01-07T23:18:00  <dmj111> it does make the most sense.
2011-01-07T23:18:20  <antimatroid> i think visibility on black and white kindles is fairly low on the priority list :P
2011-01-07T23:18:21  <sigh> it's either that or different patterns on each trail
2011-01-07T23:18:35  <dmj111> antimatroid: i imagine.  probably an audience of one.
2011-01-07T23:18:37  <sigh> and shades is much simpler to implement
2011-01-07T23:19:02  <antimatroid> dmj111: make yourself a visualiser :P
2011-01-07T23:19:55  * antimatroid is still confused as to why it's not called a gui, it's much quicker to type
2011-01-07T23:20:09  <sigh> it's not a user interface though
2011-01-07T23:20:22  <antimatroid> gi? :P
2011-01-07T23:20:22  <sigh> mostly
2011-01-07T23:21:07  <sigh> they are all vauge terms
2011-01-07T23:21:22  <amstan_> anyway
2011-01-07T23:21:23  <sigh> I'm surprised no one argued with me :P
2011-01-07T23:21:29  <amstan_> i'm going to shower/sleep
2011-01-07T23:21:32  <amstan_> cya tomorrow
2011-01-07T23:21:38  <antimatroid> night
2011-01-07T23:21:42  <sigh> shower-sleeps are awesome
2011-01-07T23:21:43  <sigh> night
2011-01-07T23:21:50  <dmj111> later
2011-01-07T23:22:06  <dmj111> so, to make fun of myself a little more... I didn't realize until the last week of the contest that you could mouseover the planets and ships to highlight them.
2011-01-07T23:22:24  <sigh> I implemented that :P
2011-01-07T23:22:37  <dmj111> awesome.  I wish I realized it did it earlier.
2011-01-07T23:22:46  <antimatroid> mcleopold's tcp would let you hover over a planet to bring it to the front
2011-01-07T23:23:07  <antimatroid> that needs to be done too, an official tcp
2011-01-07T23:23:18  <sigh> dmj111: it was only there from the last month or so
2011-01-07T23:24:07  <dmj111> i feel better now.  with all the time I was looking at it, it seemed that I should have noticed sooner.
2011-01-07T23:24:15  <sigh> it was the same time as the click and draggable timeline
2011-01-07T23:24:22  <sigh> did you notice that?
2011-01-07T23:24:23  <dmj111> what???
2011-01-07T23:24:29  <sigh> I did that too :P
2011-01-07T23:24:47  <sigh> click on graph at the bottom
2011-01-07T23:25:17  <dmj111> holy crap.  in my luddite keyboard only lifestyle, I *am* missing out on some good stuff.

2011-01-07T23:38:39  <antimatroid> dmj111: thoughts on disappearing walls?
2011-01-07T23:39:28  <dmj111> i think they may be critical to a strategy.  but I am not sure how to use them.
2011-01-07T23:40:07  <dmj111> for example you could suicide one bike to unleash a hidden bot and trap two enemy bikes who didn't know you were there.
