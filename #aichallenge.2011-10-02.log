2011-10-02T19:00:28  <janzert> McLeopold: the problem occurs when there was no result from the query
2011-10-02T19:00:44  <janzert> in particular in the case when a user has no games yet
2011-10-02T19:03:27  <janzert> i.e. the while loop is dropped out of immediately before $cur_row is ever changed from the NULL it is initially set to
2011-10-02T19:04:57  <janzert> the way it executes now, the check at line 218 is always true
2011-10-02T19:06:41  <_flag> McLeopold: Given an average of ~5 players a game, and the fact that the match making system should favour matching players of similar skill, 1/10 games seems very low
2011-10-02T19:09:36  <_flag> Also considering there are only ~70 players on the server
2011-10-02T19:10:35  <_flag> And my recent bot has yet to play with DarkMomoBot or leviathan after 65 games
2011-10-02T19:11:12  <_flag> It's not a big deal, but it's somewhat frustrating to submit a bot, and still be unsure of as to where it ranks after 65 games because it takes an eternity to climb to the top

2011-10-02T19:13:37  <_flag> Also, that statistic since the last reset doesn't mean much because I was playing against the top 10 a ton with my previous bots, it's just the most recent version that barely gets any games

2011-10-02T19:46:10  <aarossig> oh right, and the square wave of is also on a scope
2011-10-02T19:46:20  <amstan> so... it goes something like this
2011-10-02T19:46:26  <amstan> someone in the world clicks a button to load the page
2011-10-02T19:46:33  <amstan> it goes to a random server at amazon
2011-10-02T19:46:40  <amstan> then from there it goes to our dev comp
2011-10-02T19:46:52  <amstan> from there it gets piped to the serial port
2011-10-02T19:47:07  <amstan> then the mcu converts all the "\n"s to a click
2011-10-02T19:47:10  <aarossig> don't forget minicom!
2011-10-02T19:47:16  <amstan> and then the scope shows that click
2011-10-02T19:47:38  <aarossig> and a mechanical counter much like your cars odometer ++'s

2011-10-02T20:51:45  <ChrisH> McLeopold: turn 190-191 of this game (http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=8824&user=5) seems to have a case of a hill being razed while there are still 12 ants in the hive, This seems to contradict our conversation on the topic a few days ago. Any idea what's going on here.

2011-10-02T23:16:16  <McLeopold> @later tell ChrisH you can prevent your hill from being taken, but you still have to keep an ant on top to ensure a collision if enemies are close, the ant moved off of the hill and didn't protect
2011-10-02T23:16:16  <contestbot> McLeopold: Yes master!
2011-10-02T23:46:40  <McLeopold> @later tell janzert we still have a sandbox error every once in a while from the workers.  it seems these happen after the game is done during cleanup.  I think the game should be posted before cleaning up the jails, so we don't lose the results as much
2011-10-02T23:46:40  <contestbot> McLeopold: I come to serve.
2011-10-02T23:47:27  <McLeopold> @later tell janzert also, it looks like I'm adding a NoneType and a str, but I'm not getting a traceback... idk?
2011-10-02T23:47:27  <contestbot> McLeopold: Ready to serve, my lord.
