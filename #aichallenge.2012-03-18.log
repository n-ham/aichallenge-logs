2012-03-18T19:55:32  <mleise> This is a blend of Psychology and A.I.. Fairly old, but plan recognition is an interesting aspect of A.I.
2012-03-18T19:57:38  <mleise> I actually came to that from reading on the A.I. in the game F.E.A.R., where a developer stated that plan recognition would create more useful NPCs.
2012-03-18T19:59:57  <mleise> Like when you pick certain types of plants in an RPG, they could do the same. Or when you try to forge a sword, they could keep the fire going.
