2012-06-05T09:52:48  <conor_f> anyone have any ideas for something I could code?
2012-06-05T09:53:56  <conor_f> something fun. Linux or web-based, C/++, Perl, web-based languages
2012-06-05T09:54:06  <conor_f> really bored for the first week of holidays :P
2012-06-05T10:05:06  <smjms> create a program which analyzes a video file by the amount of detail, and comes up with a suggestion for a more efficient resolution and bitrate
2012-06-05T10:06:40  <smjms> or just for a single image, and suggestion for a better resolution
2012-06-05T10:07:08  <mcstar> conor_f: why not http://learnyouahaskell.com/
2012-06-05T10:08:00  <smjms> because some don't live up to their megapixels
2012-06-05T10:08:04  <smjms> *some cameras
2012-06-05T10:15:22  <smjms> I guess the easiest way for analyzing single images would be iterating through some resolutions
2012-06-05T10:16:37  *** amstan <amstan!~alex@aichallenge/admin/amstan> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2012-06-05T10:17:10  <smjms> downscaling the image, upscaling to the original size, calculating the difference for each pixel, and averaging the differences and the channels into a single number
2012-06-05T10:18:53  <smjms> each scaling would have its own output value
2012-06-05T10:24:28  <smjms> I have a guess, that the table of output values should have relatively low levels of detail loss with the lighter downscales, and then a sudden rise
2012-06-05T10:27:06  <smjms> imagemagick could be used in analyzing single images
2012-06-05T10:27:32  <smjms> and ffmpeg for extracting some sample images from videos

2012-06-05T10:43:53  <amstan> conor_f: apparently there's quite a few jobs looking for it
2012-06-05T10:43:59  <mcstar> it is wildly used, yes
2012-06-05T10:44:13  <conor_f> interesting
2012-06-05T10:44:22  <amstan> but i guess all of them would want a CS degree
2012-06-05T10:44:41  <conor_f> this is the functional language mcstar used for some PE problems?
2012-06-05T10:45:04  <mcstar> generally people describe haskell exactly like that ^^

2012-06-05T14:02:59  <conor_f> yup
2012-06-05T14:03:08  <conor_f> I like haskell now :P
2012-06-05T14:05:24  <mcstar> conor_f: i remember now, i showed you some complicated/ugly code right? thats when you lost your apetite for it
2012-06-05T14:08:21  <amstan_> zomg this is exactly what i need: http://kst-plot.kde.org/screenshots/sessions/
2012-06-05T14:08:27  <amstan_> it support real time plotting
2012-06-05T14:08:52  * thestinger remembers seeing some other new Qt plotting thing a week ago
2012-06-05T14:09:02  <amstan_> yes, but this is real time
2012-06-05T14:09:09  <amstan_> i can get my device connected to it really easy
2012-06-05T14:09:13  <conor_f> mcstar: yes
2012-06-05T14:09:16  <amstan_> i just have to wait for it to compile
2012-06-05T14:09:45  <mcstar> amstan_: is that embeddable?
2012-06-05T14:09:47  <conor_f> mcstar: it was for counting the number of ways to arrange blocks in a wall if I recall correctly
2012-06-05T14:09:54  <amstan_> mcstar: idk, but it's kdeish
2012-06-05T14:10:13  <mcstar> amstan_: it would be nice if it offered its widgets
2012-06-05T14:10:36  <mcstar> i thought you would have implemented your plots by now :)
2012-06-05T14:10:45  <amstan_> mcstar: this is for another project
2012-06-05T14:10:49  <amstan_> projects*
2012-06-05T14:10:58  <amstan_> i want to display data from an accelerometer
2012-06-05T14:11:02  <amstan_> well... 5 accelerometers
2012-06-05T14:11:13  <amstan_> i really don't feel like writing uis for it
2012-06-05T14:11:20  <amstan_> just a quick and dirty real time plot
2012-06-05T14:11:34  <mcstar> amstan_: whats the input method for this kst?
2012-06-05T14:11:43  <amstan_> mcstar: | separated values
2012-06-05T14:11:53  <mcstar> other than text files?
2012-06-05T14:11:58  <amstan_> i could make my microcontroller output them directly
2012-06-05T14:12:00  <amstan_> idk..
2012-06-05T14:12:11  <mcstar> socket, fifo?
2012-06-05T14:12:15  <mcstar> that would be nicer
2012-06-05T14:12:17  <amstan_> if i want to conserve bw i could get a python script in between to convert from binary data to...
2012-06-05T14:12:21  <amstan_> mcstar: idk
2012-06-05T14:12:32  <amstan_> mcstar: lots of people say you can do realtime, i don't think you can do realtime with just files
2012-06-05T14:12:40  <amstan_> so it must have some kind of pipe system
2012-06-05T14:12:47  <amstan_> i'll tell you after i compile it
2012-06-05T14:12:49  <mcstar> yeah, i guess so
2012-06-05T14:12:52  <mcstar> k
2012-06-05T14:13:17  <amstan_> hopefully it doesn't error
2012-06-05T14:13:27  <mcstar> amstan_: i would like to help with the contest if i have time, but im not into design either
2012-06-05T14:13:39  <amstan_> i see a moc_asciisource.cxx
2012-06-05T14:14:12  <amstan_> mcstar: hmm, i know someone from waterloo who might be interested
2012-06-05T14:14:29  <amstan_> mcstar: he started designing a tron website way back, but we denied him idk why
2012-06-05T14:14:34  <amstan_> well.. jeff denied his skin
2012-06-05T14:14:36  <amstan_> i liked it
2012-06-05T14:14:50  <amstan_> he was always interested in UX stuff
2012-06-05T14:15:20  <mcstar> why didnt aarossig take the job of design?
2012-06-05T14:15:49  <amstan_> perhaps
2012-06-05T14:15:53  <amstan_> yeah.. he's doing that too
2012-06-05T14:16:03  <amstan_> but in C#
2012-06-05T14:16:38  <thestinger> UI stuff makes me depressed
2012-06-05T14:16:41  <mcstar> great, if mono, then lets write all the stuff in it, ill be willing to code in f#
2012-06-05T14:16:46  <thestinger> I can't figure out how the hell to set keybindings for this widget
2012-06-05T14:17:21  <amstan_> thestinger: some people really like it
2012-06-05T14:17:30  <mcstar> i have to peel more garlic...
2012-06-05T14:17:52  <amstan_> 99% compiled
2012-06-05T14:18:39  <amstan_> creating package!
2012-06-05T14:18:54  <mcstar> aur?
2012-06-05T14:19:16  <mcstar> how does arch feel like? youve been using it in ~6months?
2012-06-05T14:19:20  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vZTN5NA working scrollback completion at least :P
2012-06-05T14:19:24  <mcstar> in -> for
2012-06-05T14:19:28  <thestinger> now if only I knew how to bind keys other than up/down
2012-06-05T14:19:33  <amstan_> mcstar: pretty decent
2012-06-05T14:20:28  <mcstar> thestinger: i do that by capturing key events
2012-06-05T14:20:43  <mcstar> at least in qt, you have to override a virtual function
2012-06-05T14:20:46  <thestinger> the problem is that this widget doesn't have functions I can call to trigger the stuff
2012-06-05T14:20:54  <thestinger> so I think I have to fake keypresses
2012-06-05T14:20:57  <thestinger> :\
2012-06-05T14:21:27  <mcstar> what will it be?
2012-06-05T14:22:26  <thestinger> well atm ctrl-tab makes the completion thing pop up, so it would be nice if tab/shift-tab worked to cycle through them
2012-06-05T14:23:41  <mcstar> i mean whats the purpose of the app
2012-06-05T14:25:42  <thestinger> oh, a terminal :P
2012-06-05T14:26:24  <thestinger> I want some of the nice iterm2 features like completion from scrollback
2012-06-05T14:26:34  <mcstar> character terminal with gui popup comletion?
2012-06-05T14:28:24  <mcstar> well, looking forward to it
2012-06-05T14:29:23  <thestinger> well, I tried doing it with tmux but wasn't successful
2012-06-05T14:29:46  <thestinger> mcstar: https://github.com/thestinger/termite the basics already work and people are using it apparently :P
2012-06-05T14:30:49  <thestinger> it's just a UI wrapper around vte anyway
2012-06-05T14:30:51  <thestinger> nothing complicated
2012-06-05T14:31:20  <thestinger> I'm just going to fix some of the vte bugs "upstream" to improve some of the stuff like search

2012-06-05T14:45:05  <conor_f> tried to do http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/ukj67/642012_challenge_60_difficult/
2012-06-05T14:45:14  <conor_f> thought it'd be easier than it is :O
2012-06-05T14:47:37  <thestinger> conor_f: it is pretty easy, once you know how the modular arithmetic stuff works
2012-06-05T14:47:57  <conor_f> hmm
2012-06-05T14:48:17  <conor_f> Compute φ(n) = (p – 1)(q – 1), where φ is Euler's totient function.
2012-06-05T14:48:22  <conor_f> got confused at that stage
2012-06-05T14:48:56  <thestinger> (p - 1)(q - 1) is equal to the totient of pq
2012-06-05T14:49:05  <conor_f> or does that just mean calculate (p-1)(q-1) and that is the answer to φ(n)
2012-06-05T14:49:10  <thestinger> since they are primes
2012-06-05T14:49:15  <thestinger> conor_f: yes
2012-06-05T14:49:23  <conor_f> oh, well now I feel stupid -_-
2012-06-05T14:49:36  <conor_f> thank you very much

2012-06-05T14:54:50  <thestinger> why?
2012-06-05T14:55:02  <mcstar> joke
2012-06-05T14:55:06  <thestinger> :P
2012-06-05T14:55:27  <mcstar> its blinkin!
2012-06-05T14:55:30  <mcstar> g
2012-06-05T14:55:31  <thestinger> anyway the scrollback completion and other fancy things are still in branches
2012-06-05T14:55:51  <mcstar> how can i disable blinking?
2012-06-05T14:55:56  <thestinger> mcstar: config.h :P
2012-06-05T14:56:05  <mcstar> haha
2012-06-05T14:56:10  <thestinger> or gtkrc (there's a blink setting that is respected)

2012-06-05T15:01:48  <thestinger> via url-select
2012-06-05T15:02:29  <thestinger> other terms on linux don't have completion from scrollback though
2012-06-05T15:02:48  <thestinger> before I was just using tmux + a zsh function and it sort of worked a bit
2012-06-05T15:02:59  <thestinger> but broke on unicode and was noticeably slow
2012-06-05T15:04:14  <mcstar> i just have to learn to search in my command history
2012-06-05T15:04:55  <thestinger> mcstar: it completes from outputs though
2012-06-05T15:05:08  <mcstar> yeah i get it
