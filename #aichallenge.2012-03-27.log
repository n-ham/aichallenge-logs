2012-03-27T14:14:16  <mleise> I like the "religious conversion game" idea. it is different from what we had so far and it looks manageable in terms of server horse power
2012-03-27T14:30:46  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2012-03-27T14:35:10  <antonh> smiley1983, sounds good. is there any date set?
2012-03-27T14:44:26  <mleise> antonh: Likely not
2012-03-27T14:46:43  <mleise> A.I. Challenge is supposed to become a non-profit organization in Canada and the most important person to the project is often away/offline. And even when the legal side is ok, the last game was ~1 year in development by volunteers.
2012-03-27T14:47:16  <amstan> hopefully we can do less development this time around
2012-03-27T14:47:25  <amstan> less time that is
2012-03-27T14:47:27  <Zannick> zeta!
2012-03-27T14:47:30  * Zannick ducks
2012-03-27T14:47:32  <amstan> problem is that organization stuff
2012-03-27T14:47:33  <mleise> haha
2012-03-27T14:48:06  <mleise> no Zannick is right, we chose Zeta for the next contest and there we go with our dev time estimate ....  waaaayyyy offf
2012-03-27T14:48:13  <amstan> in about a month i'll get together with aarossig and talk to accountants/lawyers and see what's to happen
2012-03-27T14:48:39  <mleise> aarossig is who again?
2012-03-27T14:48:44  <amstan> mleise: the problem last time is that we cheaped out and didn't go with zeta, so we rewrote a half working framework
2012-03-27T14:48:53  <amstan> mleise: guy who made the ants webdesign
2012-03-27T14:49:01  <mleise> ah right
2012-03-27T14:49:23  <Zannick> yeah, i vanished for a while and then people made months of changes to the old framework
2012-03-27T14:50:17  <mleise> Someone has to share his/her vision for Zeta, otherwise noone is going to blindly hack on it. I mean.. the goals were there, but no details.
2012-03-27T14:50:42  <amstan> mleise: we should probably have a meeting about all this sometime
2012-03-27T14:50:50  <Zannick> i had some vague details
2012-03-27T14:51:03  <amstan> i don't think anyone has too specific goals
2012-03-27T14:51:04  <mleise> that is an oxymoron
2012-03-27T14:51:20  <mleise> either vague or detailed :p
2012-03-27T14:51:22  <amstan> the general thing is django, but other than that no idea
2012-03-27T14:51:44  <Zannick> i think i would be a little worried working on it now due to similarities to my actual work
2012-03-27T14:51:56  <mleise> hmm, some of the things we implemented for Ants were supposed to go into Zeta. Multiplayer games for example
2012-03-27T14:52:29  <Zannick> i'm probably okay for some parts of it
2012-03-27T14:52:50  <mleise> Zannick: So you work on a game server of sorts?
2012-03-27T14:52:50  <amstan> Zannick: are you doing that google contest now or something?
2012-03-27T14:52:59  <Zannick> the what?

2012-03-27T14:55:42  <amstan> Zannick: i know google released some similar contest to ai challenge
