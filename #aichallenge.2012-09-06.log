2012-09-06T10:17:44  <Icebone1000> anyone can clarify a question to me?
2012-09-06T10:20:16  <Icebone1000> why the radius is given as 55? why not 7.4 at once, and how can I compute what are the visible tiles given the radius?
2012-09-06T10:24:08  <pairofdice> Because of reasons, and simply
2012-09-06T10:25:54  <Icebone1000> great...How do I compute what and how much tiles can I see given a radius value?
2012-09-06T10:31:08  <pairofdice> Well it gives you the area, and Area is what pi * r^2, so r = sqrt(pi/area)  ?
2012-09-06T10:32:11  <pairofdice> I don't think I did it like that anyway
