2011-03-13T00:08:49  <antimatroid> bss03: it's sort of like that now, except i'm catching << for file streams and doing the save format then
2011-03-13T00:08:58  <antimatroid> i'm not very happy with it like that though
2011-03-13T00:09:07  <bss03> antimatroid: Then a write() and read() function that does the network/file/other marshaling.
2011-03-13T00:10:19  <bss03> '<<' available as a non-operator with print() '>>' available as a non-operator with scan().
2011-03-13T00:10:48  <antimatroid> one wouldn't input a game except in the save format
2011-03-13T00:11:05  <antimatroid> it's actually really hard to write down a game with more than 2 players
2011-03-13T00:11:16  <antimatroid> but this will handle any number ignoring memory limits

2011-03-13T00:58:03  <antimatroid> bss03: what are your thoughts on not including a "no parameter" constructer if it makes no sense to use it?
2011-03-13T01:08:01  <bss03> antimatroid: Declare one as private, then don't implement it.
2011-03-13T01:08:55  <bss03> antimatroid: I'm working under the assumption that this class is entirely non-struct-like.
2011-03-13T01:10:16  <bss03> The private -> no implementation way prevents use from outside the class, and gives a linker error if you accidentally use it inside the class.
2011-03-13T01:12:58  <antimatroid> i have everything as structs, but i have been considering switching this back to classes
2011-03-13T01:13:10  <antimatroid> this is my general game theory library
2011-03-13T01:13:29  <antimatroid> i'm cleaning everything up because i want to use it for thesis stuff this year
2011-03-13T01:13:54  <antimatroid> i'll put it up on github once i've cleaned things more
2011-03-13T01:14:39  <bss03> I generally try and reserve the "struct" keyword for POD.
2011-03-13T01:14:52  <antimatroid> it's all i use normally :P
2011-03-13T01:15:05  <antimatroid> i'm a communist when it comes to programming, everything is public
2011-03-13T01:15:30  <antimatroid> but people can really mess things up with this library if the start changing things themselves
2011-03-13T01:16:22  <bss03> Having to deal with a lot of C and some ugly C++/ESQL/C mixes, having the semantic anchor of "struct" -> "POD" is helpful for retaining sanity.
2011-03-13T01:17:14  <bss03> In "pure" C++ though, I don't have much opinion; I guess use whichever saves you the most typing. :P
2011-03-13T01:18:00  <bss03> If everything is public, hasing a no-arg constructor probably does "make sense" though.
2011-03-13T01:18:38  <antimatroid> nah, the point is it makes no sense to make a pure/mixed strategy without having game dimensions, so without passing that it can't construct something that is usable
2011-03-13T01:18:45  <antimatroid> and i use pure strategies for indexing tensors
2011-03-13T01:18:58  <antimatroid> as they internally store the index value
2011-03-13T01:19:19  <antimatroid> a similar thing happens with mixed strategies but for more efficiently calculating lots of expected utilities
2011-03-13T01:21:31  <antimatroid> bss03: what's more appealing? :P
2011-03-13T01:21:31  <antimatroid> NStrategy strategy(game.dimensions); or
2011-03-13T01:21:31  <antimatroid> NStrategy strategy = game.NStrategy();
2011-03-13T01:22:15  <bss03> I'm a big fan of the Factory pattern, so I like the later.
2011-03-13T01:22:41  <antimatroid> i like the later too
2011-03-13T01:22:45  <antimatroid> it just seems less standard
2011-03-13T01:23:05  <antimatroid> and it's longer, which is pretty much against my life rules
2011-03-13T01:24:32  <bss03> Well, I guess the techincal argument would be "Does it make sense to have a NStrategy without a specific game object in mind?"
2011-03-13T01:24:40  <bss03> If so, the first.  If not, the second.
2011-03-13T01:24:55  <antimatroid> no, that's the reason i don't include the constructers, i need game.dimensions
2011-03-13T01:26:13  <bss03> Since everything is public, couldn't use just create a "uninitialized" NStrategy and then populate it based on something other than game.dimensions?
2011-03-13T01:26:22  <bss03> s/use/users/
2011-03-13T01:27:17  <antimatroid> a normal strategy is really just a vector of ints of length noPlayers, but for increment functions and calculating indexes for tensors i need to know the dimensions
2011-03-13T01:27:25  <antimatroid> and otherwise you would need the number of players anyway
2011-03-13T01:27:35  <bss03> I think if you class is only designed to work a certain way, the access levels should reflect it, which likely means making something private, the class non-struct-like, and doing the "private -> no implementation" thing with the default constructors you dont' like.
2011-03-13T01:27:56  <antimatroid> you strictly need the dimensions for a mixed strategy because each player assigns a probability distribution across their strategy vector
2011-03-13T01:31:10  <bss03> I'm an insufferacle purish though.  It comes from having to be pragmatic at my DJ, while also having to work around earlier "pragmatism".

2011-03-13T03:04:40  <antimatroid> i don't like that
2011-03-13T03:05:14  <antimatroid> rules would be the same, don't overload it unless the use is obvious

2011-03-13T03:12:46  <bss03> Walking through jmcarthur's "starter pack" is enlightening to me.
2011-03-13T03:13:42  <bss03> It seems to be a pretty dense application of MTL, which seems to be the norm for doing imperative stuff in Haskell.
2011-03-13T03:14:08  <antimatroid> sigh: has anyone ever said haskell isn't confusing?

2011-03-13T03:17:41  <bss03> Well, it hurts that "learn monads" isn't really a single task.
2011-03-13T03:17:54  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-13T03:18:23  <bss03> The [] monad is significantly different in *behavior* than the STM or IO monad, although the interface is the same.
2011-03-13T03:18:31  <sigh> I might try to write a haskell bot, but I looked at jmcarthur's starter pack and couldn't make head or tail of it :P
2011-03-13T03:19:01  <sigh> bss03: yeah, that's the thing... and there are a million *tutorials* on monads which all say different things
2011-03-13T03:19:15  <antimatroid> your mums a monad, yeah!!!
2011-03-13T03:19:18  <bss03> sigh: I'm working through it slowly.  Eventually, I'll add some documetnation to make it easier to read.
2011-03-13T03:19:32  <sigh> cool :)
2011-03-13T03:19:54  <bss03> sigh: Also, having even a do-nothing except query a bunch of things example would help A LOT.

2011-03-13T04:12:07  <Frontier1> im not at home ^^. shi... well there is for example the red ant. it converts food into ants. the food disappears correctly, but the new ant shows up a few squares away

2011-03-13T04:13:34  <sigh> this happens everytime an ant spawns from food?
2011-03-13T04:13:54  <sigh> or only on specific occasions?
2011-03-13T04:14:20  <Frontier1> not on very short games. it seems to happen when there is a lot going on. maybe some ant locations get mixed up over the course of a long game
2011-03-13T04:14:55  <Frontier1> But it happens right from turn 0 on in that case
2011-03-13T04:15:47  <_flag> Question: When I play games, sometimes food turning into an ant will trigger more food (previously out of range) to turn into ants, and sometimes it won't. Is this expected?

2011-03-13T05:28:17  <antimatroid> yeah okay cool
2011-03-13T05:33:43  <sigh> Frontier1: I can't figure out how that replay could have been generated. Can you tell me what you ran to create it. If you can, I have some changes in sigh/aichallenge which make runs deterministic, so if you can reproduce it that way it would be even better
2011-03-13T05:51:28  <Frontier1> I used the RandomBot and 60 turns, but I'll pull your changes now and repeat the test.
2011-03-13T06:00:35  <Frontier1> sigh: It doesn't run deterministically.
2011-03-13T06:00:59  <sigh> Frontier1: use --seed argument to playgame.py
2011-03-13T06:01:10  <Frontier1> ok thx
2011-03-13T06:01:43  <sigh> it propagates the seed to the bots as part of the options, and I've made the python bots aware of it
2011-03-13T06:03:45  <Frontier1> here you are: http://pastebin.com/tARp2KPp
2011-03-13T06:04:23  <Frontier1> sigh: That's a good idea.
2011-03-13T06:04:52  <Frontier1> Is it part of the stdio communication?
2011-03-13T06:05:27  <sigh> yeah, you can see it in the replay output at the top too
2011-03-13T06:05:34  <sigh> that's exactly how the bots see it as well
2011-03-13T06:08:11  <Frontier1> Thats a good point about the replay format. Yesterday I found some flaws in it, too. Like for example a layman's approach would kill everything after the last turn, because the ants give no orders for the 'end game state' and so are considered dead in this turn.
2011-03-13T06:13:10  <sigh> yeah... i think there might be some issues there, but I haven't thought too deeply about them
2011-03-13T06:13:57  <sigh> Frontier1: would you mind pasting the exact command you used to create that run?
2011-03-13T06:16:18  <Frontier1> ./playgame.py --seed 42 -m maps/random4.txt -t 60 -o output "python bots/python/RandomBot.py" "python bots/python/RandomBot.py" "python bots/python/RandomBot.py" "python bots/python/RandomBot.py"
2011-03-13T06:16:42  <Frontier1> Python version is 2.6 if that is your next question ;)
2011-03-13T06:16:50  <sigh> :)
2011-03-13T06:18:50  <Frontier1> The random number generator implementation could be different, though.
2011-03-13T06:20:15  <Frontier1> I remember a warning in a Delphi version about using pseudo random numbers for encryption, as the implementation could change between compiler releases.
2011-03-13T06:23:02  <sigh> ahhh... dammit... I know why
2011-03-13T06:23:09  <Frontier1> yes? what is it?
2011-03-13T06:23:12  <sigh> I'm outputting the ant's FINAL position
2011-03-13T06:23:27  <sigh> :P
2011-03-13T06:23:39  <Frontier1> that explains why the coordinates were never too far off
2011-03-13T06:24:37  <Frontier1> I'm glad it isn't something complicated.
2011-03-13T06:25:07  <sigh> yeah... I was really confused because the code is so simple... and the engine was fine because the old visualiser worked
2011-03-13T06:28:13  <bss03> jmcarthur: ping?
2011-03-13T06:28:56  <sigh> Frontier1: do you think it would be better if the map showed the initial game position as well?
2011-03-13T06:30:15  <Frontier1> sigh: I actually liked the map like this. It reminds me of the Youtube video previews.
2011-03-13T06:30:27  <sigh> in what way?
2011-03-13T06:30:51  <Frontier1> You get more information from a later state of the game than the initial state.
2011-03-13T06:31:02  <sigh> fair enough
2011-03-13T06:31:11  <sigh> will leave as is :)
2011-03-13T06:31:45  <Frontier1> Maybe someone will write a local replay browser that displays the map as a preview... maybe
2011-03-13T06:32:53  <sigh> Frontier1: ok, fixed and upload to sigh/aichallenge
2011-03-13T06:34:50  <Frontier1> perfect, its working
2011-03-13T06:36:36  <bss03> @later tell jmcarthur Is there a way to get the final TurnInfo without re-implementing runTurn?
2011-03-13T06:36:36  <contestbot> bss03: Yep.
2011-03-13T06:36:42  <sigh> Frontier1: cool
2011-03-13T06:36:46  <sigh> antimatroid: you around?
2011-03-13T06:37:07  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-13T06:37:44  <sigh> can you look at this function and tell me if it is what you expected: https://github.com/sigh/aichallenge/blob/sym-food/ants/ants.py#L565
2011-03-13T06:38:03  <sigh> assume that initial_ant_list and find_nearest_land work as you would expect
2011-03-13T06:38:17  <sigh> (this is for symmetric food)
2011-03-13T06:39:26  <antimatroid> sigh: what's with the "find closest land"?
2011-03-13T06:40:08  <antimatroid> sigh: you also can't assume players start with just 1 ant
2011-03-13T06:40:13  <sigh> if the current square is occupied
2011-03-13T06:40:34  <antimatroid> i don't think you can avoid issues doing that
2011-03-13T06:40:49  <antimatroid> how do you tie break the closest square fairly?
2011-03-13T06:40:53  <sigh> well, suggest something better
2011-03-13T06:40:59  <sigh> you can't
2011-03-13T06:41:19  <sigh> map becomes asymmetric when the game starts
2011-03-13T06:41:28  <antimatroid> my suggestion was to pick another location if one of the squares is containing an ant
2011-03-13T06:42:42  <sigh> ok, so you want to break the map into disjoint sets with n points each (where n is the number of players), and you want to pick a random set where none of the points are occupied
2011-03-13T06:42:44  <sigh> is that it?
2011-03-13T06:43:33  <antimatroid> that was my very naive symmetric method yes, although i was willing to allow some of those squares to contain food already
2011-03-13T06:43:56  <antimatroid> i don't necessarily mind what you've done, was just checking what it's doing, i've said a few times i have no idea how to actually do it fairly :P
2011-03-13T06:44:52  <sigh> I will see if I can implement your method efficiently
2011-03-13T06:45:15  <sigh> also, with more than 1 ant per player how does the logic for the translation go?
2011-03-13T06:49:28  <antimatroid> i haven't done actual more than 1 ant per player, but i imagine i'd need to enforce all enemies in a separate row/col then you could just take any 2 enemies starting ant locations to find translation amounts
2011-03-13T06:51:55  <sigh> if we are doing any of this logic based on initial ant positions, let's limit it to 1 ant per player
2011-03-13T06:54:59  <antimatroid> i asked mcleopold the other day and he said assume there may be more
2011-03-13T06:55:39  <antimatroid> i think it'd be ideal for testing anyway
2011-03-13T06:57:24  <antimatroid> sigh: is it hard for you to just assume it'll work for any two enemy ants start loc differences? then i'll play around later and work out whether that's valid or not
2011-03-13T06:59:09  <sigh> antimatroid: it should be fine
2011-03-13T06:59:23  <sigh> so long as the logic is straight-forward
2011-03-13T07:15:32  <antimatroid> is there an efficient way to do battle resolution option 2?
2011-03-13T07:16:04  <antimatroid> my original method was like iteratively make graphs until no ants need to be removed
2011-03-13T07:26:13  <sigh> antimatroid: not sure, thinking about it now
2011-03-13T07:41:04  <antimatroid> sigh: there are some annoying example cases with option 2 imo too
2011-03-13T07:41:16  <antimatroid> like the existence of an extra one of your ants can mean 2 die instead of none
2011-03-13T07:42:20  <antimatroid> ab..   .b..
2011-03-13T07:42:20  <antimatroid> ..c.a  ..c.a
2011-03-13T07:42:30  <sigh> yeah, it's a bit odd
2011-03-13T07:44:21  <antimatroid> option 1 <3
2011-03-13T07:44:24  <antimatroid> :p

2011-03-13T09:36:13  <Frontier1> @later tell sigh: Right now I can't tell if an ant dies in the last turn. Expect a correction in the replay format there. Maybe it could be an additional optional parameter as in the case of food items. If it is there, the ant did not survive the game.
2011-03-13T09:36:13  <contestbot> Frontier1: OK
2011-03-13T09:44:06  <janzert> does the new replay format handle the case of an ant standing still for a turn?
2011-03-13T09:46:32  <janzert> if it doesn't it needs to be extended to do that as well and if it does can all ants just stand still for the final game state?

2011-03-13T10:05:45  <Frontier1> janzert: That is possible. In that case we need to make the actual number of turns played a required parameter, too. I think we'll go with that.

2011-03-13T10:15:06  <janzert> Frontier: even if you make ants carry a number of turns played parameter there still needs to be a way to say an ant stood still on a turn (or turns) somewhere in the middle of its life
2011-03-13T10:15:56  <Frontier> janzert: the command string is in the form 'nsew-' where - means: stood still
2011-03-13T10:16:05  <janzert> ahh ok
2011-03-13T10:16:38  <janzert> so is there a reason ants that are alive in the last move can't just get a - for the final move?
2011-03-13T10:16:49  <janzert> or final state rather

2011-03-13T12:02:08  <Frontier> janzert: The duration of the game is the the result of the longest running command string or score entry. So without a game duration in the parameter list the game would just become a turn longer.
2011-03-13T12:03:14  <McLeopold> Frontier: how's the new format?
2011-03-13T12:03:37  <Frontier> McLeopold: Sleeping soundly in its cradle
2011-03-13T12:04:51  <Frontier> It is a bit of a ping-pong, because sigh and I are seldom online at the same time, but we have this new format described in the wiki which is compressing the data really well (<1:10) and the currently checked in visualizer understands it.
2011-03-13T12:05:22  <McLeopold> nice
2011-03-13T12:05:33  <McLeopold> did you need a game length parameter?
2011-03-13T12:05:37  <Frontier> (The engine is in sigh's repository.) Only the end game state is currently flawed. Either all ants die or no ant dies in the last turn
2011-03-13T12:06:07  <McLeopold> Okay, hopefully I will get it merged soon
2011-03-13T12:06:38  <Frontier> That's the point. Basically the game length can be derieved from the data, but then we don't know why the command string of an ant ends with the game. Did it survive? Did it die?
2011-03-13T12:08:53  <Frontier> There is also food which can 'survive' the game and I have to process that again after the game duration is known. It works, but it could be simpler :)
2011-03-13T12:11:44  <McLeopold> the 'end' turn should be defined up front, so you know
2011-03-13T12:13:51  <Frontier> Yep, you are right.

2011-03-13T18:06:22  <bss03> @later tell jmcarthur Your ants-bot library doesn't seem to build under GHC 6.12.1, which is what is going to be on the workers.  The Monad instance for Etiher [Char] moved around.
2011-03-13T18:06:23  <contestbot> bss03: Yep.
2011-03-13T18:08:36  <jmcarthur> bss03: hey
2011-03-13T18:08:44  <jmcarthur> i don't remember even using that instance...
2011-03-13T18:09:32  <jmcarthur> last i checked it built with ghc 6.12.3, but i changed a few things since that
2011-03-13T18:09:40  <jmcarthur> and yeah, i need to check with 6.12.1
2011-03-13T18:10:07  <bss03> jmcarthur: maybe I have old version or something.  I thought I cloned last night.
2011-03-13T18:10:15  <bss03> s/cloned/getted/
2011-03-13T18:10:28  <jmcarthur> well, i haven't really pushed anything since i linked it to you i think
2011-03-13T18:10:47  <bss03> GHC 6.12.1 claims you use it for calling mapM on line 109 of Internal.hs
2011-03-13T18:10:48  <jmcarthur> what module/line is it complaining about?
2011-03-13T18:10:54  * jmcarthur checks
2011-03-13T18:11:17  <bss03> Defintiely using do notation on a function that returns Either String Parameters.
2011-03-13T18:11:24  <jmcarthur> ah yeah
2011-03-13T18:11:29  <jmcarthur> i forgot i did that
2011-03-13T18:11:41  <jmcarthur> alright, that'll be something to change when i get the chance
2011-03-13T18:12:02  * jmcarthur makes a note to install 6.12.1 for testing
2011-03-13T18:12:14  <bss03> I'll probably mail you a patch bundle this evening.
2011-03-13T18:12:18  <jmcarthur> sweet
2011-03-13T18:12:39  <bss03> I intend to get a compile working on Squeeze that includes an example of how to use the library.
2011-03-13T18:12:55  <jmcarthur> i really should have given you my example
2011-03-13T18:13:33  <jmcarthur> it wasn't anything amazing, but it would have gotten you up to speed more quickly
2011-03-13T18:13:43  <jmcarthur> sorry about that
2011-03-13T18:14:24  <jmcarthur> my basic plan is for people to compose a few run* functions depending on what features they need (and the starter could just have all of them by default so people don't need to worry about it)
2011-03-13T18:15:43  <jmcarthur> it may seem overkill to break it up like this, but i was finding the all-in-one version much more difficult to change and maintain
2011-03-13T18:17:00  <jmcarthur> the fact that you can pick and choose the parts you need is just a side effect of me fixing my bigger problem. i'm even considering just stacking all these transformers in the library and only exposing one monad in the first place
2011-03-13T18:17:33  <jmcarthur> which would have an interface closer to what i had before
2011-03-13T18:17:56  <jmcarthur> (which was a bit simpler)
2011-03-13T18:18:54  *** closedbracket <closedbracket!~closedbra@southeast-invest.oneringnetworks.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-03-13T18:19:04  <bss03> Right.  My example does that first thing.  Makes a type alias for the TurnT WaterT AntsOutputT AntsInput stack.
2011-03-13T18:19:37  <jmcarthur> yeah. that stack is awkward right now
2011-03-13T18:19:59  <bss03> Then, I have the meat of the example, which basically just queries everything. and issues "go north" orders to every ant.
2011-03-13T18:20:16  <bss03> (and Loops, with "advance >> exampleAnt")
2011-03-13T18:20:19  <jmcarthur> i also don't like the noncommutativity of AntsOutputT and AntsInputT, but i don't know what to do about that
2011-03-13T18:21:13  <jmcarthur> my example prefers north, then east, then south, then west, then no moving, for each ant, based on where water is
2011-03-13T18:21:19  <bss03> Commutivity is a nice-to-have, as long as we have a stack order that works we can just document that.
2011-03-13T18:21:25  <jmcarthur> basically like the starter should be
2011-03-13T18:22:05  <jmcarthur> if i go through with collapsing it down to just one monad then commutativity isn't a big deal whatsoever
2011-03-13T18:22:41  <bss03> I was a little surprised you didn't just have an AntsIO instead of that split.
2011-03-13T18:23:01  <jmcarthur> i did at first
2011-03-13T18:23:14  <jmcarthur> it was just hard to navigate the code, for me
2011-03-13T18:23:26  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: my planetwars bot actually consisted of several bots chained together
2011-03-13T18:23:28  <jmcarthur> i got tired of trying to hunt down various, vaguely-named functions
2011-03-13T18:23:38  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: interesting!
2011-03-13T18:23:52  <McLeopold> DefenseBot, AttackBot, FunnelBot and some others.
2011-03-13T18:24:15  <McLeopold> with a little logic to choose priorities based on growth and ship difference with the enemy
2011-03-13T18:24:16  <bss03> As long as you still export the Transformers and their associated type classes, it would probably be good for newbies if we used the Facade pattern.

2011-03-13T18:25:20  <McLeopold> My performance issues boiled down to me not knowing how to make my calculations lazy

2011-03-13T18:25:39  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: ah yeah, haskell would have made that the default :)
2011-03-13T18:26:04  <antimatroid> will ubuntu install on an ntfs formatted hdd?
2011-03-13T18:26:08  <jmcarthur> bss03: yes, i think that's where i'm leaning
2011-03-13T18:26:21  <McLeopold> antimatroid: did you ever find out how to make python lists behave as queues?
2011-03-13T18:26:23  <bss03> Well, I didn't have MTL for PW, so I evnded up hacking to gether partial implementations of State etc.
2011-03-13T18:26:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: you have to use deques
2011-03-13T18:26:39  <McLeopold> you don't
2011-03-13T18:26:47  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: ?
2011-03-13T18:26:48  <antimatroid> how do you use a list like a queue?
2011-03-13T18:26:48  <McLeopold> list.pop() and list.pop(0)
2011-03-13T18:27:00  <antimatroid> that'll do it
2011-03-13T18:27:12  <McLeopold> it's just faster with deque
2011-03-13T18:27:20  <antimatroid> oh, so that is horribly slow?
2011-03-13T18:27:24  <bss03> My queues are always finger trees. :)
2011-03-13T18:27:30  <bss03> Data.Sequence for the win.
2011-03-13T18:27:33  <jmcarthur> finger trees are actually not very fast
2011-03-13T18:27:37  <McLeopold> lists are single linked I think?
2011-03-13T18:27:39  <antimatroid> queue<type> ftw
2011-03-13T18:27:39  <jmcarthur> they just have really good complexity
2011-03-13T18:27:43  <McLeopold> deque is double?
2011-03-13T18:27:54  <jmcarthur> still, i <3 finger trees
2011-03-13T18:27:56  <McLeopold> they are all just c implementations in the backend :)
2011-03-13T18:28:00  <antimatroid> yeah dequeue is like a double ended vector in c++
2011-03-13T18:28:12  <antimatroid> deque**
2011-03-13T18:28:28  <jmcarthur> are python lists different from arrays?
2011-03-13T18:28:40  <jmcarthur> i thought the default collection type was arrays
2011-03-13T18:28:41  <antimatroid> i assume they're implemented as lists?
2011-03-13T18:29:00  <antimatroid> i guess that wouldn't work real well for arbitrary indexing
2011-03-13T18:29:01  <jmcarthur> with geometric expansion or somesuch
2011-03-13T18:30:28  <bss03> jmcarthur: Is there a good way to drop the requirement that runTurnT needs a TurnT m *[Score]*?
2011-03-13T18:31:30  <jmcarthur> bss03: the only way i can think of is to add a continuation parameter to it
2011-03-13T18:32:03  <jmcarthur> which i didn't think was helpful anyway
2011-03-13T18:32:03  <bss03> I'm betting either could be confusing to newbs.
2011-03-13T18:32:17  <jmcarthur> the either function?

2011-03-13T18:33:15  <jmcarthur> yeah the main reason i made TurnT was so that i could advance the state and handle loop abortion without the developer needing to think about it
2011-03-13T18:33:23  <jmcarthur> or even really be aware of it
2011-03-13T18:33:46  <jmcarthur> it would be nice if runTurnT accepted a polymorphic return type
2011-03-13T18:33:54  <antimatroid> is that the last turn?
2011-03-13T18:34:11  <jmcarthur> but it would have to be like...  runTurnT :: (forall a. TurnT m a) -> m [Score]
2011-03-13T18:34:13  <antimatroid> i still think it'd be nice if end just replaced go to indicate the end of the game
2011-03-13T18:34:17  <jmcarthur> which might be even worse for beginners
2011-03-13T18:34:45  <jmcarthur> and i'm also not sure if i can get that to work
2011-03-13T18:35:31  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: "end" just replaces "turn <n>"

2011-03-13T18:43:03  <bss03> Not the either function.  I think the either having the return type forced to something that "doesn't make sense" or having to pass a continuation could be confusing.
2011-03-13T18:43:57  <bss03> I'm trying to hide the [Score] type in my example.
2011-03-13T18:45:07  <bss03> jmcarthur: Also, not that I can think of a reason for it, but is there a way to access the final TurnInfo?  The one that comes after the [Score] in the input format?

2011-03-13T23:30:15  <McLeopold> idea 2) further divide the map into sections based on overlapping voronoi
2011-03-13T23:30:45  <antimatroid> sigh has already done a basic symmetric spawning method
2011-03-13T23:30:51  <antimatroid> but there are still issues
2011-03-13T23:31:06  <McLeopold> what are they?
2011-03-13T23:31:29  <antimatroid> you are picking n squares to fill with food, what do you do if some of those squares contain ( i) a food square) (ii) a food square
2011-03-13T23:31:44  <antimatroid> ergh, (ii) an ant
2011-03-13T23:31:59  <McLeopold> spiral outward looking for the next best spot
2011-03-13T23:32:14  <antimatroid> how do you fairly pick which direction to spiral from?
2011-03-13T23:32:19  <sigh> yeah, that's what antimatroid had an issue with
2011-03-13T23:32:29  <sigh> he only wants to place the food if ALL locations are free
2011-03-13T23:32:32  <antimatroid> it's the same issue we had with a battle resolution method is it not?
2011-03-13T23:32:56  <McLeopold> it doesn't sound like it is
2011-03-13T23:33:11  <antimatroid> we didn't want 1:1 because then who do you kill with a.b.a
2011-03-13T23:33:28  <antimatroid> here you have .a.b and you want to place food where a is, where do you place it?
2011-03-13T23:33:32  <antimatroid> isn't that similar?
2011-03-13T23:33:58  <McLeopold> I see your point, but not that similar
2011-03-13T23:34:09  <antimatroid> i'm not saying don't do that, just pointing that issue out
2011-03-13T23:34:40  <antimatroid> my current opinion might be something like fill in food twice (because you should have been faster to get it) then maybe move on to other squares if an ant blocks one?
2011-03-13T23:35:09  <antimatroid> but i'm very iffy on all of that, i just want to make sure people actually consider the (dis)advantages to each way it could be done
2011-03-13T23:35:15  <_flag> Why not pick a random offset each turn and spawn food at the starting position of each player plus that offset?
2011-03-13T23:35:30  <McLeopold> _flag: excellent idea
2011-03-13T23:35:33  <McLeopold> but...
2011-03-13T23:35:39  <antimatroid> _flag: that'd be good for asymmetric spawning
2011-03-13T23:35:53  <McLeopold> we are discussing what happens when the offset for each player has something different
2011-03-13T23:36:08  <McLeopold> like food, and, land
2011-03-13T23:36:12  <McLeopold> *ant(
2011-03-13T23:36:23  <_flag> So for asymmertic maps, or they have something different on that square?
2011-03-13T23:36:37  <janzert> note that simply skipping a spot if an ant is in it is yet another slight incentive to spread out more
2011-03-13T23:36:44  <McLeopold> let's keep our discussion to symmetric right now
2011-03-13T23:36:54  <antimatroid> you don't need to do it like that either, if you have rtrans and ctrans, you can just pick a non-water square and find all n "symmetrical" locations by repeatedly translating
2011-03-13T23:37:23  <janzert> not that it's a bad thing in itself
2011-03-13T23:37:45  <antimatroid> the maps are constructed so that for any location L, L + nT = L
2011-03-13T23:38:03  <McLeopold> what does "fill in food twice" mean?
2011-03-13T23:38:29  <antimatroid> like say one of the squares to be made food was already food, leave it as food (or we could mark is as needing food the next time its free?
2011-03-13T23:38:39  <antimatroid> i hadn't considered that last idea yet
2011-03-13T23:38:50  <_flag> How about just try a different square?
2011-03-13T23:39:01  <antimatroid> same could be done if an ant's there, just have a "grid" of numbers of food squares waiting to spawn
2011-03-13T23:39:13  <McLeopold> okay, let's go with my other idea, of the dividing the map into more sections
2011-03-13T23:39:15  <antimatroid> i quite like that
2011-03-13T23:39:24  <sigh> more sections
2011-03-13T23:39:25  <sigh> ?
2011-03-13T23:39:49  <McLeopold> yeah, so back to my fair but random number generator
2011-03-13T23:40:04  <antimatroid> sigh: you've probably thought most about this other than i, what do you think about waiting to spawn food (up to many food squares) if it's blocked?
2011-03-13T23:40:57  <sigh> I don't know... your proposed method is expensive computationally
2011-03-13T23:41:00  <McLeopold> I think waiting is bad
2011-03-13T23:41:04  <sigh> if I understand it right
2011-03-13T23:41:23  <sigh> oh waiting instead of retrying, that could starve the game
2011-03-13T23:41:25  <antimatroid> i don't think so
2011-03-13T23:41:44  <antimatroid> yeah, that could be an issue, but i don't think it'd starve it much?
2011-03-13T23:42:09  <antimatroid> unless we're planning to flood the maps
2011-03-13T23:42:15  <antimatroid> which would suck
2011-03-13T23:42:31  <McLeopold> so, let's say each of 4 bots has about the same amount of land, all with lots of ants.  If each territory spawned 1 food, even if it wasn't symmetric, that would still be fair.
2011-03-13T23:43:03  <sigh> that's what do_food_sections does now?
2011-03-13T23:43:03  <antimatroid> i'm looking for something that is at least very much almost symmetric
2011-03-13T23:43:16  <McLeopold> that's why I think dividing the map into many sections, even layers of sections will work.
2011-03-13T23:43:18  <antimatroid> something like that i would be planning to do for asymmetric maps anyway
2011-03-13T23:43:38  <antimatroid> by symmetric i mean each player should have exactly the same outlook
2011-03-13T23:43:39  <McLeopold> if you get a block, then just pick another spot in the same section
2011-03-13T23:43:48  <antimatroid> if you play n bots all doing the same actions, it should result in a draw
2011-03-13T23:44:27  <antimatroid> that is my definition for a symmetric game
2011-03-13T23:45:05  <McLeopold> so, with a voronoi diagram, you will find points where 3 or more territories meet.  Just add those points as starting positions, then recalc a new diagram.
2011-03-13T23:45:32  <antimatroid> i can play around with that
2011-03-13T23:45:54  <_flag> What's the problem with just retrying in case of a collision?
2011-03-13T23:45:56  <sigh> McLeopold: my only worry is that is starting to get a bit complicated
2011-03-13T23:46:00  *** readncode <readncode!~closedbra@63.133.138.10> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-13T23:46:12  <antimatroid> can i propose something that does give full symmetry for testing symmetry, and do this other method for testing asymmetry, then if asymmetry spawning works better and we go with symmetric maps that can easily be used anyway?
2011-03-13T23:46:19  <McLeopold> sigh: at the beginning, yes, startup will take a little to process
2011-03-13T23:46:24  <antimatroid> sigh: the engine code can be as complicated as necessary
2011-03-13T23:46:58  <antimatroid> i would like to be able to at least test with full symmetry locally
2011-03-13T23:47:00  <McLeopold> so, the goal is to uniformly, but randomly fill the whole map every so often
2011-03-13T23:47:34  <antimatroid> i don't think you want to fill the whole map, one of the biggest complaints of my ants game was there were too many ants
2011-03-13T23:47:47  <antimatroid> and i agreed
2011-03-13T23:47:56  <antimatroid> i only had that many so i could see all the different things happen in a game
2011-03-13T23:48:23  <McLeopold> so, each bot section (what we are calculating now) can be subdivided into further sections.  So pick a sub-section to spawn in, the attempt to pick any free spot in that subsection.
2011-03-13T23:48:48  <sigh> i see
2011-03-13T23:48:56  <McLeopold> and we can do sub-sub-sections as well
2011-03-13T23:48:57  <antimatroid> that's asymmetric yeah?
2011-03-13T23:49:02  <McLeopold> should be
2011-03-13T23:49:34  <McLeopold> if you had a random section shape, can you divide it into X section of the same size easily?
2011-03-13T23:50:39  <McLeopold> antimatroid: by uniformly and randomly, I'm only thinking something like 1% of the land
2011-03-13T23:51:18  *** readncode <readncode!~closedbra@63.133.138.10> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-03-13T23:51:29  <McLeopold> basically, the .a.b situation is ignored and anything can happen
2011-03-13T23:51:42  <McLeopold> so, at the micro level, it would be unfair
2011-03-13T23:52:25  <antimatroid> sigh: with that method i proposed, you could store a queue of locations that are waiting to have food spawned, then go through and spawn there each turn, not adding the location back onto the queue if it no longer needs food, and adding locations as conflicts happen, so it'd be reasonably efficient
2011-03-13T23:52:28  <McLeopold> The other thing we could do is create some special spawning rules that affect game play, like food doesn't spawn within X of an ant.
2011-03-13T23:53:01  <antimatroid> you could do that, but that's just my method with x > 0
2011-03-13T23:53:07  <antimatroid> and < 1
2011-03-13T23:53:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if you did the queues, I would then say each attempt to spawn new stuff should avoid the spots that are queued up.
2011-03-13T23:53:39  <antimatroid> McLeopold: maybe not repeat a land placement square in the last x turns?
2011-03-13T23:53:40  <McLeopold> your right, it is your method :)
2011-03-13T23:53:49  <antimatroid> i don't think it would be a very big problem
2011-03-13T23:53:53  <McLeopold> yeah, we should be doing that anyway
2011-03-13T23:54:11  <McLeopold> every land space should be attempted before a single repeat
2011-03-13T23:54:43  <antimatroid> i think that still has issues skipping locations like that
2011-03-13T23:54:57  <antimatroid> but i'd be very happy with something like that with symmetric maps for the moment
2011-03-13T23:54:59  <sigh> McLeopold: why is that important?
2011-03-13T23:55:03  <McLeopold> in fact, you could generate an entire maps food spawn schedule up front, and just rotate through it
2011-03-13T23:55:04  <antimatroid> but i'm off to the shop to get food, bbs
2011-03-13T23:55:43  <McLeopold> sigh: we don't really want to be random, we want to be fair
2011-03-13T23:56:06  <sigh> but how is covering all land more fair?
2011-03-13T23:56:10  <McLeopold> we want each land space to have a 1/total land chance of spawning food
2011-03-13T23:56:28  <McLeopold> and we should attempt to enforce that more than just a random number
2011-03-13T23:56:39  <McLeopold> so that spots will be "due" for food
2011-03-13T23:56:44  <sigh> but how does that equate to fairness, fairness comes about from being symmetrical no?
2011-03-13T23:57:22  <McLeopold> that's one part of it, but when the bots have different territories and some are eliminated, symmetric isn't fair anymore
2011-03-13T23:57:26  *** amstan <amstan!~alex@174-138-221-195.cpe.distributel.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
2011-03-13T23:57:37  <sigh> yeah, that's true
2011-03-13T23:57:41  <antimatroid> it's also a good test that everything is working if you can play n bots symmetrically and see a draw consistently
2011-03-13T23:58:33  <McLeopold> what's fair is that if you can get to 40% of the map first, you should see a growth rate that is 40% of the total
2011-03-13T23:59:07  <McLeopold> what if we didn't spawn food?
2011-03-13T23:59:10  <antimatroid> actually, i like your picking out a random listing of squares
2011-03-13T23:59:21  <_flag> How is symmetric not fair if bots are eliminated, if a bot takes over another bot's territory it should be to their benifit, no?
2011-03-13T23:59:22  <antimatroid> because it really is a game of maintaining territory yeah?
2011-03-13T23:59:25  <antimatroid> and that enforces that better
2011-03-13T23:59:56  <McLeopold> _flag: if they get just one part of someone else
