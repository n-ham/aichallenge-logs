2011-07-25T13:23:16  <bhasker> morning
2011-07-25T13:52:27  <iouri_> is there any specific newline convention used here?  Or should I assume that it can be any of \n, \r\n and \r?
2011-07-25T13:53:11  <amstan> iouri_: it's definatelly one of those and not some alien one
2011-07-25T13:53:25  <iouri_> ok, thanks
2011-07-25T13:54:30  <amstan> it's probably going to be \n
2011-07-25T13:54:47  <amstan> but sometimes we have to go with \r\n because of windows
2011-07-25T13:54:51  <amstan> \r is probably rare
2011-07-25T13:56:53  <iouri_> ah, thanks.  I'll just check for all of them, it's not that expensive.
2011-07-25T13:57:31  <amstan> what language?
2011-07-25T13:57:36  <iouri_> c++
2011-07-25T13:57:38  <amstan> see what the starter package does

2011-07-25T15:39:55  <amstan> jbroman: it's kinda hard not to when pidgin flashes as soon as i login
2011-07-25T15:45:11  <jbroman> amstan: Also the wiki should perhaps not list Ants as a "Winter 2011" game, since it's nearly August. :P
2011-07-25T15:45:21  <jbroman> Unless you mean December, of course.
2011-07-25T15:45:44  <amstan> yeah... we really need a time designation system that is immune to time passing by
2011-07-25T15:45:57  <amstan> which isn't really possible..

2011-07-25T15:46:59  <amstan> that could work

2011-07-25T15:47:23  <amstan> janzert: when did it need straightening?
2011-07-25T15:47:41  <janzert> a few hours ago, I told contestbot to message you later :}
2011-07-25T15:47:55  <janzert> "trying to do a git pull on the beta server it complains about changes to ants/play_one_game.cmd. I tried doing git checkout -- ants/play_one_game.cmd to get it back to the right state but it didn't help"
2011-07-25T15:47:58  <amstan> janzert: oh, i probably missed it, i was reconnecting a lot since i was at school
2011-07-25T15:48:09  <amstan> you just want a pull?
2011-07-25T15:48:21  <janzert> that's all I was trying to do yes
2011-07-25T15:49:42  <janzert> it kinda looked like it might be a newline conversion problem
2011-07-25T15:50:11  <janzert> and was getting it confused into thinking the file was modified
2011-07-25T15:51:52  <amstan> man.. it really doesn't like me
2011-07-25T15:58:43  <amstan> janzert: almost
2011-07-25T15:59:20  <amstan> janzert: though, i seem to have reset /manager/jskills/JSkills_0.9.0.jar
2011-07-25T15:59:39  <amstan> janzert: for some reason it wasn't the same as the one in the repo before i starter
2011-07-25T15:59:41  <amstan> started*
2011-07-25T16:00:00  <janzert> yeah, I had modified it so it didn't crash quite as often
2011-07-25T16:00:07  <janzert> but it wasn't real fix and still crashed
2011-07-25T16:00:23  <janzert> so never ended up committing it

2011-07-25T16:01:46  <amstan> i git fetchd
2011-07-25T16:01:52  <janzert> trueskill should probably be removed from the repository since we don't use it and it produced worse results than jskill :/
2011-07-25T16:02:19  <amstan> then to merge i did git reset origin/epsilon then git checkout epsilon
2011-07-25T16:02:27  <amstan> maybe a -f for the checkout
2011-07-25T16:02:51  <amstan> i still don't know why that trueskill implementation is bad
2011-07-25T16:02:53  * janzert wonders how it got so confused
2011-07-25T16:03:31  <janzert> yeah, I don't know what the cause is just that the results from it don't agree with the online calculator results
2011-07-25T16:03:56  <amstan> do you have a sample?
2011-07-25T16:04:12  <amstan> i would have submitted a bug report with this
2011-07-25T16:04:16  <amstan> but i didn't have the data
2011-07-25T16:04:35  <janzert> I think everything I tried was different
2011-07-25T16:04:52  <jbroman> amstan: I take it you'll follow up on the NVIDIA guy's further questions?
2011-07-25T16:05:00  <amstan> jbroman: yes
2011-07-25T16:05:22  <janzert> test_trueskill.py in the manager directory has one test that differed
2011-07-25T16:05:58  <janzert> at least I'm fairly certain it did
2011-07-25T16:06:11  <amstan> antimatroid1: do you remember any pw enthusiasts that wanted to keep playing after the contest? anything happened to them? a tcp server maybe?

2011-07-25T16:29:23  <amstan> you serious?
2011-07-25T16:29:29  <jbroman> This was a question.
2011-07-25T16:29:31  <jbroman> You had two in there.
2011-07-25T16:29:45  <jbroman> I was asking whether that was necessary.
