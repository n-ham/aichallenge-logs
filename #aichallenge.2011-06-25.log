2011-06-25T07:30:29  <antimatroid> carlop: got any ideas for how to make nice maze maps?
2011-06-25T07:32:38  <carlop> antimatroid: no, actualy i'm trying to enumerate all possible symmetry that a map can have, reducing the problem only to desing a player zone (that can be triangular, like current 8-player symmetric map, or square/rectangular/rombo)
2011-06-25T07:33:01  <antimatroid> yeah, i've taken a look at your pastebin and wiki link
2011-06-25T07:33:07  <carlop> so the map generator can be a part that generate a pattern, and a part that replicate the pattern in simmetric way
2011-06-25T07:33:40  <antimatroid> for the rotational maps i made yesterday, i have 5 types of symmetry for 2 players, 3 types of symmetry for 4 players and 1 type for 8 players
2011-06-25T07:33:53  <antimatroid> i'm not sure why i don't have 7 for 2 players, 2 of them don't seem to work
2011-06-25T07:34:04  <carlop> on build interesting pattern (eg maze one) i don't have idea
2011-06-25T07:34:20  <antimatroid> one can use a dfs to build a "perfect maze"
2011-06-25T07:34:24  <carlop> i think that there are at least 7 pattern for 2player, maybe more
2011-06-25T07:34:27  <antimatroid> but the players regions are going to be disconnected
2011-06-25T07:34:35  <antimatroid> really i want multiple paths leading to places
2011-06-25T07:34:50  <antimatroid> there should be 7 for 2 players i think
2011-06-25T07:35:03  <antimatroid> based on the rotations of an nxn grid

2011-06-25T07:36:49  <carlop> i think the 6th and 7th that you miss are this one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_pg and the same pattern but vertical
2011-06-25T07:37:26  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/Md2LfGpr
2011-06-25T07:37:30  <antimatroid> those are the 7 i expect
2011-06-25T07:37:49  <antimatroid> i don't have the vertical/horizontal flip then diagonal flip rotations
2011-06-25T07:38:02  <antimatroid> when i generate it the way i'm doing all the others, it doesn't come out symmetrically :s
2011-06-25T07:38:16  <antimatroid> even though i use the functions for that in one of the 4 player symmetric types
2011-06-25T07:38:58  <antimatroid> carlop: do you know much group theory?
2011-06-25T07:39:11  <antimatroid> i love groups, they're awesome

2011-06-25T07:41:48  <carlop> i have not understand your paste with the symmetry.... sorry
2011-06-25T07:42:05  <antimatroid> my paste has 2 player symmetric games
2011-06-25T07:42:22  <antimatroid> done with the 7 non-identity rotations of the grid
2011-06-25T07:42:48  <carlop> now i get it
2011-06-25T07:43:09  <carlop> but 2nd and 7th can't work, cause they are not symmetric
2011-06-25T07:44:12  <carlop> they have only a 90degree turn, that can work only with 4x player
2011-06-25T07:45:08  <antimatroid> carlop: that would explain why 2 didn't work for me :)
2011-06-25T07:46:09  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/0hAmMMMP
2011-06-25T07:46:19  <antimatroid> those rotations leave the starting positions the same
2011-06-25T07:46:39  <antimatroid> but i think as you mentioned, you can construct examples where a horizontal/vertical then diagonal flip does not leave the map unchanged
2011-06-25T07:47:08  <carlop> like this one: http://pastebin.com/gSbeWeEE

2011-06-25T07:49:08  <antimatroid> i do a transpose like a matrix when diagonally flipping

2011-06-25T07:49:32  <antimatroid> you can take h,v,d flips as generators for the group of rotations on a square
2011-06-25T07:54:04  <Rabidus> whoo, gold in intermediate lotus challenge!
2011-06-25T07:54:12  <carlop> i'm thinking.... i'm not sure this generetor work, cause they have always a fixed point
2011-06-25T07:54:40  <antimatroid> carlop: sorry what?
2011-06-25T07:55:37  <carlop> there are symmetry without a fixed point (eg traslation, a type of symmetry), but all flips preserve the center of the square in the same point
2011-06-25T07:55:59  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-25T07:56:15  <antimatroid> if i had to do a diagonal flip to get to my rotation, i have had to use square maps
2011-06-25T07:56:22  <antimatroid> otherwise they can be rectangles
2011-06-25T07:57:02  <antimatroid> h and v would have needed it also
2011-06-25T07:57:19  <antimatroid> Rabidus: what is that? and well done :P
2011-06-25T07:58:42  <UncleVasya> 10 mins of interval between submissions must be on now, right? If so it might be broken because I've made two success uploads with 5 mins of interval.

2011-06-25T07:59:33  <antimatroid> it might have been changed
2011-06-25T07:59:44  <antimatroid> actually, i think it's meant to be really short once your bot has compiled
2011-06-25T08:00:08  <carlop> antimatroid: the problem is that i think we are not looking for composition of rotation and mirroring, but for composition of rotation, mirroring and translation

2011-06-25T08:00:58  <antimatroid> no, i think you want all three of those along with tiling rotations/mirrows/transposes of those
2011-06-25T08:01:06  <antimatroid> a translation isn't going to increase the size of the map
2011-06-25T08:02:06  <carlop> look of this two example: they are made of mirroring and translation, and without translation they can be done

2011-06-25T08:24:40  <carlop> another possible idea for maze generation is this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_avoiding_walk, try to build a water path like the one, then adding brige somewhere
2011-06-25T08:25:57  <antimatroid> the problem is i want a maze with noisy lines and wider than 1 width corridors
2011-06-25T08:26:15  <antimatroid> and more than one way connecting stuff up
2011-06-25T08:26:40  <antimatroid> i think maybe if i do that random sized linear lines with some noise
2011-06-25T08:26:46  <antimatroid> then just random walk those all over the place

2011-06-25T11:10:41  <UncleVasya> I subscribe to channel bot like to RSS.
2011-06-25T11:11:25  <UncleVasya> Asking him to send me PM with link when my bot plays a new game.
2011-06-25T11:12:08  <UncleVasya> Just like he says about github changes.
2011-06-25T11:14:21  <UncleVasya> When I update browser waiting for new games, I see the outcome of the game before I watch the game itself. No intrigue :(
2011-06-25T11:15:33  <UncleVasya> And with this feature of  channel bot and visualizer watching games can be much more interesting.
2011-06-25T11:17:04  <UncleVasya> mleise: what do you think?
2011-06-25T11:19:46  <mleise> hmm can you explain what the visualizer should look like?
2011-06-25T11:20:47  <mleise> a RSS feed with the latest games and results ok, but what is the role of the visualizer?
2011-06-25T11:22:46  <UncleVasya> In RSS feed with latest game a link comes like that: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=37498
2011-06-25T11:23:50  <UncleVasya> I follow link and before I start watching game I see who is winner.
2011-06-25T11:24:40  <UncleVasya> I suggest to sent link like that http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=37498&mode=no_info
2011-06-25T11:25:43  <UncleVasya> where mode=no_info means that all info about outcome isn't shown.
2011-06-25T11:26:39  <UncleVasya> Just player names in normal order.
2011-06-25T11:31:27  <UncleVasya> Also it can be useful if someone wants to share a cool replay with a very unexpected final to his friends.

2011-06-25T14:59:31  <stocha> Okay, today i want to defend the position "Maps making process (or static maps) should be settled BEFORE the end of the beta"
2011-06-25T14:59:47  <stocha> 1/ People don't want to write code that will never be used.
2011-06-25T15:00:38  <stocha> So let's take an example. Let's say you want to write blocking code. So you detect good point for blocking on map, clever algorithm for puting ant in there etc ... but let's say it take 3000 line of code and 3 weeks of tuning/debugging.
2011-06-25T15:01:30  <stocha> Now, imagine you are already in the real contest, and sudenly, there is this new features of maps never having any blocking point (corridors are always 3 square wide).
2011-06-25T15:01:37  <stocha> how would you feel ? isn't that bad ?
2011-06-25T15:02:00  <stocha> (now maybe you had fun during those three week, but well)
2011-06-25T15:02:35  <stocha> I have other example, involving time management etc. But i hope i already made the point clear. So i won't insist.
2011-06-25T15:02:40  <stocha> what do you guys think ?
2011-06-25T15:05:24  <gobang>  stoch, your main point is to have a 'feature freeze', once it's beyond beta ?

2011-06-25T15:10:45  <stocha> davidjliu only made 1 submission. I'm yet to understand what rank it should have though.
2011-06-25T15:14:47  <stocha> have you seen the snake bot. Who can be stupid enough to build a snake bot really. It will always be very weak.
2011-06-25T15:15:20  <stocha> Maybe he made a strong bot, and the thing bugged out to being a snake.
2011-06-25T15:15:33  <stocha> once debugged, it will rule the challenge. maybe.

2011-06-25T15:50:20  <stocha> it sure is fighting bot.

2011-06-25T17:12:42  <davidjliu> what's the difference between the skill on the main rankings page and the individual profile pages?
2011-06-25T17:13:00  <stocha> Okay so sto_greed_002  is a sort of anchor.
2011-06-25T17:13:21  <stocha> basically if you are under in ranking, you really have to worry. if you are above .. well you have to worry also, but you are above.

2011-06-25T17:14:26  <stocha> (not that i can't make weaker bot, but well)

2011-06-25T17:14:46  <stocha> So we are left with three others
2011-06-25T17:15:25  <stocha> Sto03RepliCrush currently try to run shy bot code. It happens that this my highest ranked bot >_<
2011-06-25T17:15:27  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!kvirc@46.133.128.216> has quit IRC ()
2011-06-25T17:15:44  <stocha> the stoha02 is simply a test.
2011-06-25T17:16:15  <stocha> i wanted to put in there an aggressive bot, to see if it would disturb the strong bots.
2011-06-25T17:16:47  <stocha> then the stocha bot, i waiting for something i'd like to put in first place of the ranking. Wich i haven't made my mind upon yet.
2011-06-25T17:18:06  <stocha> Although the Sto03Repli and stoha02 i wanted to have as anchor.
2011-06-25T17:18:41  <davidjliu> for some strange reason, I feel like my bot is red in 95% of its games
2011-06-25T17:18:55  <stocha> davidjliu: it's always red.
2011-06-25T17:19:02  <stocha> davidjliu: if you look from your profile.
2011-06-25T17:19:18  <stocha> basically, the bot you look at the profile of, will be red.
2011-06-25T17:19:49  <davidjliu> aah, ok.. That makes sense now
2011-06-25T17:19:54  <stocha> so if you want to see your bot not red, you find one of your game, and you look at one of the opponent in there, and from there, if you find the same game, you won't be red.
2011-06-25T17:20:13  <stocha> it happens, that i have trouble seeing red ... so it's not easy for me.
2011-06-25T17:20:21  <davidjliu> I'm surprised that my bot's still holding up though... I think it's rather silly
2011-06-25T17:20:23  <stocha> whenever i'm interested in a bot, i just can't see it's ants :p
2011-06-25T17:20:28  <davidjliu> heh :)
2011-06-25T17:20:36  <stocha> davidjliu: i think it was down to like 8th place
2011-06-25T17:21:00  <stocha> and probably because of some strange interaction, it now goes as high as 3rd from time to time :)
2011-06-25T17:21:16  <stocha> it has a nack at being right where it needs to :p
2011-06-25T17:21:36  <stocha> my hypothesis though, is that it has started to learn the game by itself.
2011-06-25T17:21:47  <stocha> so in a few days, it should be ranked 1st :)
2011-06-25T17:22:03  <davidjliu> lol... I'm quite impressed with FlagCapper and Sir Macelon though
2011-06-25T17:22:09  <stocha> and in a few month, it should have control of the whole internet.
2011-06-25T17:22:20  <stocha> i think both fight.
2011-06-25T17:22:25  <davidjliu> I'll have to upload a new bot to replace it then
2011-06-25T17:22:29  <stocha> i didn't look to hard at FlagCapper though.
2011-06-25T17:22:37  <davidjliu> yeah
2011-06-25T17:22:48  <_flag> Well I'm disappointed in mine ATM, so I'm glad you like it :P
2011-06-25T17:22:51  <stocha> davidjliu: yeah, if we don't want to loose man kind, it would be advisable :p
2011-06-25T17:23:12  <stocha> _flag: i'm disapointed at it too. why is it not first ?
2011-06-25T17:23:29  <_flag> It was for awhile, until macelon submitted a new version
2011-06-25T17:23:45  <davidjliu> the funny thing about my bot is that it would currently actually work under the rules where a different engine was generated for each ant
2011-06-25T17:23:49  <_flag> Now it's crashing and timing out a bit too often, but I actually should be winning most of my games against macelon
2011-06-25T17:24:13  <stocha> _flag: would you ?
2011-06-25T17:24:21  <davidjliu> _flag: yeah, I watched one of those games... it was sad
2011-06-25T17:24:27  <stocha> can you point me to a game ?
2011-06-25T17:24:33  <_flag> See this game for example: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=37812&user=7
2011-06-25T17:24:48  <_flag> At the height of my strength, my bot starts losing due to a timeout problem
2011-06-25T17:24:59  <_flag> I think I've fixed it now though, but I'm not entirely sure
2011-06-25T17:25:39  <_flag> And another example: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=37498&user=7
2011-06-25T17:25:41  <stocha> sir_macelon start is leagues above yours in this game
2011-06-25T17:25:49  <stocha> let's talk about the first first :p
2011-06-25T17:26:08  <_flag> Look at the most recent game, I beat him :)
2011-06-25T17:26:28  <_flag> If I give myself the timeout games, I'm currently 4-2 against him with this bot
2011-06-25T17:26:40  <_flag> So I just need to fix some bugs
2011-06-25T17:27:24  <_flag> stocha: The starts are affected largely by where food spawns, so it's not uncommon for games to be largely influenced by luck
2011-06-25T17:27:39  <_flag> I'm not claiming I'm far better than him though, he does fighting much better than I

2011-06-25T17:29:57  <antimatroid> bah bot writing
2011-06-25T17:30:05  <antimatroid> maps are the current interest imo :P
2011-06-25T17:30:27  <antimatroid> davidjliu, _flag, stocha: any ideas on making maze like maps?
2011-06-25T17:30:45  <antimatroid> the best idea i've had is random walks that do random lengthed linear lines with a bit of noise
2011-06-25T17:30:52  <antimatroid> but it's not very maze generation like
2011-06-25T17:31:36  <stocha> antimatroid: the thing is, you need dead-ends.
2011-06-25T17:31:49  <stocha> but McLeopold had a maze generator. why not to use this ?
2011-06-25T17:32:01  <antimatroid> i'm not sure what he made it in
2011-06-25T17:32:07  <antimatroid> it would be good to have it all in the one file
2011-06-25T17:32:53  <stocha> maybe that : get a tile. make a maze inside it. (with one in, one out, and a lot of dead ends). then connect the different tiles in/out
2011-06-25T17:33:00  <antimatroid> dead ends could happen from the walks back tracking though
2011-06-25T17:33:05  <antimatroid> or i could randomly kill off walks
2011-06-25T17:33:41  <stocha> i think maze are good, for complex branched dead ends. And for the few connex path.
2011-06-25T17:33:54  <stocha> like there should be only one way to round the map for each directions.
2011-06-25T17:34:00  <antimatroid> the problem with making a "perfect maze" is that the players are going to be in separate regions (need to connect them somehow?) and the walls are going to all be straight
2011-06-25T17:34:04  <antimatroid> i'd prefer noisy walls
2011-06-25T17:34:09  <stocha> so maybe you do just that. build the two round ways.
2011-06-25T17:34:41  <stocha> then generate arbitrary tree, that do not overlap (all dead ends) that grow from the initial connex cross.
2011-06-25T17:34:52  <antimatroid> i want everything to be connected with more than one path
2011-06-25T17:34:58  <stocha> obviously, the initial cross should be twisted also.
2011-06-25T17:35:04  <antimatroid> you should be able to navigate your way around stuff if need be
2011-06-25T17:35:10  <stocha> what is everything ?
2011-06-25T17:35:16  <stocha> starting points ?
2011-06-25T17:35:30  <antimatroid> not everything, most, yes starting points
2011-06-25T17:35:37  <antimatroid> i don't mind little caves with one entrance
2011-06-25T17:35:39  <stocha> then really, with the map so small, and if you also want to avoid blocking ... there is not much room for maze.
2011-06-25T17:35:44  <antimatroid> but i want them to be wide enough to be non-blockable
2011-06-25T17:36:01  <stocha> at least, you can still grow dead end fractal trees here and there.
2011-06-25T17:36:11  <davidjliu> hm... I like the idea of mazes more in the sense of well-defined passageways
2011-06-25T17:36:16  <antimatroid> if i enfore the rule that an nxn block can traverse the map, then i can still get 1 width openings, but i don't get long really thin corridors etc.
2011-06-25T17:36:18  <davidjliu> but not so much as in mazes that are difficult to navigate
2011-06-25T17:36:20  <antimatroid> i quite like that
2011-06-25T17:36:46  <stocha> in my own maps, there are a lot of dead ends. In the server maps, there are very very few.
2011-06-25T17:37:32  <stocha> i think that some long twisted tiny corridor would be fun.
2011-06-25T17:37:38  <stocha> if only to loose the bots a bit :)
2011-06-25T17:38:28  <stocha> the map are so small, that twisting is a good way to make them a little bigger.
2011-06-25T17:38:52  <stocha> try to maximize the distance between the starting positions maybe.

2011-06-25T17:40:05  <stocha> so : you generate 1000 000 map, and you keep those with the maxim distance between starting place :p
2011-06-25T17:40:12  <antimatroid> a 2x2 block can traverse all land squares of that map, while there still existing 1 width corridors in places
2011-06-25T17:40:32  <antimatroid> stocha: i have a variable min_starting_distance in the map generator
2011-06-25T17:40:47  <antimatroid> it forces the ants to be at least that far appart without any water even being considered
2011-06-25T17:41:01  <stocha> not much room for twists though.
2011-06-25T17:42:23  <antimatroid> twists?
2011-06-25T17:42:30  <antimatroid> these maps are not going to be maze like
2011-06-25T17:42:38  <antimatroid> i need to do a separate generation function for that
2011-06-25T17:42:39  <davidjliu> is it just me, or are the players on the second map somewhat asymmetrical?
2011-06-25T17:42:45  <antimatroid> but the underlying symmetries should all work
2011-06-25T17:42:49  <davidjliu> like, f and g are right by each other
2011-06-25T17:43:01  <davidjliu> while a and b are rather far off
2011-06-25T17:43:13  <antimatroid> davidjliu: it's the whitespace fooling you ;)
2011-06-25T17:43:25  <antimatroid> also, a and b aren't next to each other
2011-06-25T17:43:34  <antimatroid> a is to b as g is to e
2011-06-25T17:44:23  <davidjliu> wait so... g is to f while a is to...?
2011-06-25T17:44:31  <antimatroid> davidjliu: on top of the tessellation/tile maps which are all the current maps, i now have 5 types of rotational symmetry for 2 player maps, 3 types for 4 players and 1 type for 8 players
2011-06-25T17:44:37  <antimatroid> a is to c
2011-06-25T17:44:40  <davidjliu> oh wait
2011-06-25T17:44:41  <davidjliu> ha, I see it
2011-06-25T17:44:42  <davidjliu> yeah
2011-06-25T17:44:45  <stocha> http://ants.zeroviz.us/OSw80/
2011-06-25T17:45:04  <stocha> is this a rochshar test ? :p
2011-06-25T17:45:11  <antimatroid> there we go
2011-06-25T17:45:15  <stocha> why don't you past map them ?
2011-06-25T17:45:37  <davidjliu> I rather like this map
2011-06-25T17:45:38  <antimatroid> that's a different map
2011-06-25T17:46:25  <stocha> this pastemap thing is good You can even drag to inspect the symetry :)
2011-06-25T17:46:33  <antimatroid> davidjliu: http://ants.zeroviz.us/bZnkx/
2011-06-25T17:47:10  <antimatroid> it is pretty awesome
2011-06-25T17:47:16  <davidjliu> I was talking about the 4-p one, but yeah this kind of map seems to be more... and death arena style and less random blob style
2011-06-25T17:47:27  <davidjliu> and I personally like and death arenas
2011-06-25T17:47:32  <davidjliu> *ant
2011-06-25T17:47:51  <antimatroid> i do too
2011-06-25T17:47:54  <antimatroid> but i also like variation
2011-06-25T17:48:10  <antimatroid> i've got it making 75% rotationally symmetric maps and 25% tiled
2011-06-25T17:48:25  <stocha> yeah. they seem to share some properties. wich make them all alike :p
2011-06-25T17:49:18  <McLeopold> My maze generator is the McMaps.py file
2011-06-25T17:49:52  <antimatroid> stocha, McLeopold: what do you think about the fact that a 2x2 block can traverse the maps but 1 width openings can still happen
2011-06-25T17:49:54  <antimatroid> i really like that
2011-06-25T17:50:07  <antimatroid> i'm tempted to make it a 3x3 block that needs to be able to traverse the map
2011-06-25T17:50:17  <antimatroid> i think we'd then have mostly eliminated blocking
2011-06-25T17:50:28  <stocha> antimatroid: i'm happy with 1 width
2011-06-25T17:50:35  <antimatroid> well, blocking off a region, not blocking off an opening
2011-06-25T17:50:57  <stocha> although ... it can maybe mean that there are possibility of unvelnerable ants. Which would make nothing to shorten the games.
2011-06-25T17:51:07  <McLeopold> as long as a region can be accessed by a 3x3 block, then I think the map is fine
2011-06-25T17:51:09  <stocha> invulnerability is problematic game length wise.
2011-06-25T17:52:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: any ideas on how to make more mazey maps? :P
2011-06-25T17:52:17  <stocha> very small maps, and 3x3 block connexity don't leave a lot of possibilities really. Especially if you have them symetrical to contrain them even more.
2011-06-25T17:53:37  <stocha> i guess the map we have seen are good. When you think of all those constraints.
2011-06-25T17:53:49  <McLeopold> antimatroid: my McMaps maze generator can be tuned to make very mazy maps
2011-06-25T17:54:21  <stocha> McLeopold: can you show use some 3x3 compliant maze on pastemap ?
2011-06-25T17:54:41  <McLeopold> I think my maze is 3x3 compliant?
2011-06-25T17:54:49  <antimatroid> my maze generator is pretty solid in design, the implementation however is really messy
2011-06-25T17:54:54  <stocha> don't know, let's show us
2011-06-25T17:54:59  <antimatroid> my python fu is non-existent
2011-06-25T17:55:01  <McLeopold> http://ants.zeroviz.us/BqmlS/
2011-06-25T17:55:15  <stocha> what about mazing a tile, and then go with a tile symetry ?
2011-06-25T17:55:28  <stocha> like 4 player, each in the same tile.
2011-06-25T17:55:42  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it's not 3x3 compliant
2011-06-25T17:55:46  <stocha> McLeopold: wow :)
2011-06-25T17:55:48  <McLeopold> it's close
2011-06-25T17:55:54  <stocha> now that looks like a maze
2011-06-25T17:56:01  <antimatroid> go to r 47, c 58
2011-06-25T17:56:15  <antimatroid> 57, 48 sorry
2011-06-25T17:56:22  <stocha> McLeopold: it's big dimension, small map though :p
2011-06-25T17:56:49  <McLeopold> yeah, the openings need to be tuned a little
2011-06-25T17:57:26  <stocha> ah i was looking at the wrong side of the map (seeing water as ground)
2011-06-25T17:57:56  <antimatroid> stocha: i think these are cooler maze like maps
2011-06-25T17:58:03  <McLeopold> http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm
2011-06-25T17:58:08  <stocha> i guess you could use the same, with 3x3 water . And then inverse it
2011-06-25T17:58:18  <McLeopold> This is the implementation I used, which can be tuned for very different mazes
2011-06-25T17:58:22  <antimatroid> McLeopold: imagine a full maze map, with straight lines, single width corridors and single width water
2011-06-25T17:58:25  <antimatroid> i want that on crazy maps tcp
2011-06-25T17:58:59  <McLeopold> I generate cells by placing random points with a minimum distance from each other, then create a voronoi diagram
2011-06-25T17:59:28  <antimatroid> how do you carve holes?
2011-06-25T17:59:35  <McLeopold> http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/12/maze-generation-recursive-division-algorithm
2011-06-25T17:59:38  <antimatroid> or you you not place a water square that makes the map invalid?
2011-06-25T17:59:52  <stocha> each cell has 4 potential wall in this algo it seems.
2011-06-25T17:59:57  <McLeopold> this algorythm might work well too
2011-06-25T18:00:38  <McLeopold> to carve, I look for squares that are eqidistant to only 2 points, and consider those the doorways
2011-06-25T18:01:03  <McLeopold> that's what needs to be tweeked to ensure 3x3 compliance
2011-06-25T18:01:25  <McLeopold> The code is in flux, I'm in the middle of implementing symmetric carving
2011-06-25T18:02:32  <stocha> why not simply get a maze, and zen 3x zoom it ?
2011-06-25T18:02:48  <stocha> and you then put 1width wall
2011-06-25T18:02:58  <McLeopold> stocha, I don't think that would look as nice
2011-06-25T18:03:10  <McLeopold> I'd rather just fix the doorway code
2011-06-25T18:03:25  <stocha> the 4wall cells disturbs me though :p
2011-06-25T18:03:30  <McLeopold> each cell has an arbitrary number of neighbors
2011-06-25T18:04:01  <stocha> how do you get a 4wall cells out of our water/ground division ?
2011-06-25T18:05:15  <stocha> the walls do form a maze too it seems

2011-06-25T18:07:48  <stocha> i think the algo works well, the walls as ground. And then you 3x on them.
2011-06-25T18:08:00  <stocha> the recursive division
2011-06-25T18:08:07  <McLeopold> stocha: I think in any minimal spaning tree maze, the walls and floor can both be the maze

2011-06-25T18:09:04  <stocha> it's interesting that he ends up with constant size wall though
2011-06-25T18:09:12  <stocha> constant size corridors
2011-06-25T18:09:36  <stocha> you could randomly skip some recursive branch, to build big room maybe ?
2011-06-25T18:10:00  <McLeopold> yes
2011-06-25T18:10:39  <McLeopold> play with the generator on the growing tree page to see what types of mazes are possible
2011-06-25T18:11:18  <stocha> i like the fact that you can use the wall as the maze. Because then you really can maximize the avaible ground (still re cu
2011-06-25T18:11:20  <stocha> recursive division
2011-06-25T18:11:30  <stocha> i like this recursive division thing :p
2011-06-25T18:11:37  <McLeopold> so do I :)
2011-06-25T18:12:01  <McLeopold> I tried to make one, but didn't finish
2011-06-25T18:12:24  <McLeopold> I was trying a random number of holes per wall, so it would be chopped up into rooms, but not to mazy
2011-06-25T18:13:16  <stocha> i could try to build one. but i don't know. i have trouble keeping up with all my bot subjects yet :)
2011-06-25T18:13:55  <stocha> if i try one, it will be based on recursive division for sure
2011-06-25T18:15:00  <stocha> You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúadd walls‚Äù in order to implement this algorithm. I implemented it with a ‚Äúpassage carvers‚Äù method by only changing a small piece. https://gist.github.com/904686  Also: great articles. I‚Äôve been enjoying going back and reading them when I have free time :)
2011-06-25T18:15:43  <stocha> it would have been kind to show use results :p
2011-06-25T18:16:16  <stocha> mmm with recursive division, you can adjust the size of the corridor with the number of steps it seems.
2011-06-25T18:16:33  <stocha> (using one bit width for wals)
2011-06-25T18:17:07  <stocha> so let's say you start from a blank bitmap with a certain size. the size of the corridor will depend on the number of steps you use.
2011-06-25T18:17:21  <stocha> so it should be easy to end up with 3x3 corridors

2011-06-25T20:13:31  <antimatroid> i could make the walls noisy with holes

2011-06-25T20:16:15  <antimatroid> actually, one should be able to just do random walks with walls like that
