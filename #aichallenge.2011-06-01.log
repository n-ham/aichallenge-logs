2011-06-01T00:40:58  <McLeopold> janzert: what was our games per minute during the finals last time?
2011-06-01T00:41:05  <amstan> McLeopold: like 120
2011-06-01T00:41:48  <janzert> something like that, I think it peaked around 180 or so
2011-06-01T00:41:55  <janzert> don't really remember exactly
2011-06-01T00:42:09  <McLeopold> I don't think we'll get anywhere near that this time
2011-06-01T00:42:18  <janzert> I don't either
2011-06-01T00:43:07  <janzert> of course we only need around 1/3 or 1/4 that to get the same number of players per minute
2011-06-01T00:43:10  <McLeopold> I think next I need to get some average game length stats
2011-06-01T00:43:10  <amstan> oh man, we have a ton of beta users
2011-06-01T00:43:24  <McLeopold> those are just starter users created by hjax
2011-06-01T00:43:53  <amstan> well.. no
2011-06-01T00:43:58  <amstan> only 19 in the last 24 hours
2011-06-01T00:44:07  <amstan> we still have 39 before then
2011-06-01T00:44:13  <McLeopold> janzert: I could calc player-games per minute, or turns per minute
2011-06-01T00:45:01  <janzert> games per minute and an average number of players in those games is probably sufficient

2011-06-01T00:46:27  <amstan> the square dance is pretty effective

2011-06-01T00:49:18  <janzert> the method doesn't work for all map types does it?
2011-06-01T00:49:50  <amstan> it should..
2011-06-01T00:50:51  <amstan> ok, i'm going to bed
2011-06-01T00:51:19  <janzert> oh, maybe something different is being used now. The method I had heard before I thought only worked with the offset tessellation type
2011-06-01T00:51:22  <janzert> night
2011-06-01T00:52:36  <amstan> yes, it should work for everything
2011-06-01T00:52:39  <amstan> and random is not good either

2011-06-01T01:33:07  <McLeopold> amstan: from what I've seen, high food amount, wide attack and spawn radii and asymmetric maps make for a very low skill game
2011-06-01T01:34:10  <McLeopold> I think we could add a bit more food, but not much.  The small radii for attack and spawn are working well.
2011-06-01T01:34:39  <McLeopold> We could do asymmetric, but we don't really have the time or manpower to analyze it to do it right.  Maybe next time.
2011-06-01T01:34:56  <McLeopold> Food spawning is symmetric and very fair right now.

2011-06-01T10:35:56  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, what is the difference?
2011-06-01T10:36:12  <Ice_Harley> between java and html
2011-06-01T10:37:02  <Frontier> the html visualizer is faster and offers a copy&paste solution for replay text, the java version on the other hand can be used in scripts by calling "java -jar visualizer.jar replayfile"
2011-06-01T10:37:33  <olexs> html is faster than java? :)
2011-06-01T10:38:25  <Frontier> html with css3 is said to be turing complete, but the language is actually JavaScript. And JavaScript in a browser runs faster than through a Java library. That's why :)
2011-06-01T10:38:37  <olexs> but then the html visualizer ist quite good performance-wise, it seems, it works flawlessly on my android even
2011-06-01T10:39:13  <smiley1983> you can also call the html one in scripts using "python visualizer/visualize_locally.py < 0.replay"
2011-06-01T10:39:39  <Frontier> Chrome has a very good implementation of JavaScript. They even compile parts of it into machine code.

2011-06-01T10:40:06  <olexs> the play_one_game script that was in repo earlier uses the html visualizer, i still use that to dev my bot
2011-06-01T10:40:07  <skylord5816> as does Opera
2011-06-01T10:40:41  <Frontier> skylord5816: Yeah, I thought of that when I pressed Enter :p.
2011-06-01T10:41:12  <Frontier> But it seems right now Opera is the slowest for the visualizer. ...maybe IE is slower
2011-06-01T10:42:09  <skylord5816> hm, wonder why
2011-06-01T10:42:22  <Frontier> I tried to find some docs on the internet that would help me optimize parts of the visualizer, but I couldn't find anything.
2011-06-01T10:42:22  <olexs> canvas implementation?
2011-06-01T10:42:24  <skylord5816> so, what in there do I download?
2011-06-01T10:43:17  <Frontier> Don't use Chrome's HW accelerated canvas 2d, btw. It is far from production quality
2011-06-01T10:44:38  <olexs> Frontier: it's also not in stable yet, is it?
2011-06-01T10:44:55  <Frontier> skylord5816: you mean in the git repository? there are sample bots, the engine code etc... just clone the repository :)
2011-06-01T10:45:45  <skylord5816> Frontier: ah, ok
2011-06-01T10:45:55  <Frontier> olexs: No it isn't and there is a big fat warning about it when you use it. That didn't stop a 14 year old from posting a screenshot and saying "The visualizer has a bug"
2011-06-01T10:46:14  <skylord5816> hey!!! I'm 15!!! ;)
2011-06-01T10:46:19  <olexs> lol
2011-06-01T10:46:41  <Frontier> :p After a few questions I found out that he was using Chrome 12 with experimental features active.
2011-06-01T10:47:25  <Frontier> Then amstan came around with the same problem claiming he didn't activate HW acceleration. I didn't believe him, he checked again and found out that it was active.
2011-06-01T10:48:31  <olexs> what do I do if I have an idea for improvement of say, the website? issue in github?
2011-06-01T10:49:15  <Frontier> Yeah that's probably best. What kind of idea is it?
2011-06-01T10:49:34  <olexs> for example, display version number in submission list on user page
2011-06-01T10:50:37  <olexs> I should be able to implement that as well, just no idea how github works to be honest :)
2011-06-01T10:50:40  <Frontier> Ok, that's a good one. It makes no sense to have it only in the general overview, but not on the user's page
2011-06-01T10:51:18  <Ice_Harley> visualizer works good for my Opera. Maybe i should check it speed in Chrome

2011-06-01T10:52:14  <Frontier> Ice_Harley: Do that. The speed gain in Chrome and Firefox 4 is astonishing :)
2011-06-01T10:52:14  <olexs> Frontier: signed up I am, and I have a repo clone as well. fork would be within github and I'd have to clone that separately, right?
2011-06-01T10:52:35  <Frontier> right
2011-06-01T10:53:20  <olexs> ok, I'll see what I can do.
2011-06-01T10:53:41  <Ice_Harley> Frontier: i don't see any difference in speed. Opera 11.11
2011-06-01T10:54:06  <Frontier> try adding &debug=true to the url to see the speed in the title bar
2011-06-01T10:54:45  <Frontier> and &config={"cpu":1} to get maximum speed
2011-06-01T10:55:17  <Ice_Harley> ok
2011-06-01T10:55:36  <Frontier> You are on Windows?
2011-06-01T10:56:13  <Frontier> I noticed that Opera is quite a bit slower for me on Linux, so that may be it.
2011-06-01T10:56:26  <olexs> how can I label the issue in github ("website")? or can only team members do that?
2011-06-01T10:56:42  <Frontier> olexs: no idea
2011-06-01T10:57:09  <Frontier> the gui for that is not intuitive though, maybe try a bit more :p
2011-06-01T10:57:38  <olexs> there is a "Labels" are on the right, but no active controls there, so I assume I can't do anything there :)

2011-06-01T11:46:35  <Frontier> But then I came across the passage where they want to add 24*c³ random sample points out of the set to a list. An if I understood that right that would be 192 points to go through.

2011-06-01T12:10:58  <McLeopold> janzert: It looks like we don't install clojure?
2011-06-01T12:11:50  <janzert> not sure offhand, I did notice the language entry for it in compiler.py is certainly incomplete
2011-06-01T12:12:06  <McLeopold> yeah, it's causing the worker to hang, so I'm fixing that
2011-06-01T12:20:16  <janzert> looks like it's another language that we need to do a manual install in order to get a recent version :(
2011-06-01T12:20:35  <janzert> fortunately it looks like that involves downloading and unpacking a zip to a known location
2011-06-01T12:21:19  <janzert> are you already working on setting that up or do you want me to do it?
2011-06-01T12:22:50  <McLeopold> no, you do it, I'm making sure the worker can survive the lack of a language
2011-06-01T12:23:03  <janzert> ok

2011-06-01T12:36:21  <McLeopold> I'm going to set one up for the manager as well.  contest/manager
2011-06-01T12:36:29  <amstan> McLeopold: just use another tab
2011-06-01T12:36:34  <amstan> in the same screen
2011-06-01T12:36:42  <McLeopold> what are the commands for that?
2011-06-01T12:36:52  <amstan> ctrl+a ctrl+c makes a new one
2011-06-01T12:37:05  <amstan> ctrl+a ctrl+a changes to the previous tab
2011-06-01T12:37:30  <McLeopold> 2 sessions will be easier for me, I can access the correct one by name
2011-06-01T12:37:33  <amstan> ctrl+a ctrl+$i where $i e {0-9} changes to the $ith tab
2011-06-01T12:37:55  <McLeopold> unless there is a big downside?
2011-06-01T12:38:26  <amstan> you have to constantly switch screens sessions?
2011-06-01T12:38:31  <amstan> instead of ctrl+a ctrl+a?
2011-06-01T12:39:00  <McLeopold> okay, it's in one screen
2011-06-01T12:39:13  <McLeopold> but, if I switch, do you see the switch?
2011-06-01T12:40:21  <amstan> yeah, try it
2011-06-01T12:40:35  <amstan> i think there's a thing at the bottom that tells you which tab you're in for a few seconds
2011-06-01T12:40:46  <amstan> but it's pretty obvious when you switch tabs
2011-06-01T12:41:00  <McLeopold> okay

2011-06-01T13:25:07  <janzert> I was worried about putting it somewhere that is on the regular classpath that it might cause unintentional interference with another JVM entry
2011-06-01T13:25:46  <McLeopold> well, I'd just go with the ubuntu way.  then move the symlink over to the latest jar
2011-06-01T13:25:47  <janzert> I suppose everything is very well namespaced so that isn't much of a concern though
2011-06-01T13:26:38  <janzert> or is /usr/share/java not on the default classpath?

2011-06-01T14:14:35  <bhasker> it should have made some random moves

2011-06-01T14:23:18  <McLeopold> janzert: food spawning was 1 starting food per 100 land squares and 1 food per player per turn after that.
2011-06-01T14:23:54  <McLeopold> The start food has been reduced to 1 per 200-300 land squares
2011-06-01T14:24:16  <janzert> ok, and I've kind of changed my mind a bit from what I said above. the current top end rate is plenty for maps with a low number of players
2011-06-01T14:25:02  <janzert> I think maybe the spawn rate should be propotional to the number of players in the game instead of absolute
2011-06-01T14:25:09  <McLeopold> The food spawning is between 3 per turn and 1 every 20 turns, not dependant on players
2011-06-01T14:25:48  <McLeopold> I could see it being tied to land area, but not players.
2011-06-01T14:25:49  <janzert> for a 4 player map 3 per turn is plenty but for a 9 player seems a bit low for the top end
2011-06-01T14:26:01  <McLeopold> land area should be tied to players somewhat
2011-06-01T14:26:20  <janzert> that would probably work out ok as well
2011-06-01T14:26:44  <McLeopold> I really like having games with very little food
2011-06-01T14:27:01  <McLeopold> It means bots have to be good at both types of maps
2011-06-01T14:27:12  <janzert> I like having some with very little food, but I want some with a pretty good amount too
2011-06-01T14:27:30  <janzert> very little food seems to emphasize exploration
2011-06-01T14:28:53  <janzert> i.e. I'm fine with the low end of spawn rate everywhere right now, and the high end of the rate on low player games, I just want a higher end rate for the larger player games
2011-06-01T14:29:50  <McLeopold> 1 per player per turn is too high, imo
2011-06-01T14:29:56  <McLeopold> what should be our max?
2011-06-01T14:30:48  <janzert> I was thinking of a range between .25 and .8 per player per turn earlier
2011-06-01T14:32:11  <janzert> although that's a somewhat higher low end than current for large player maps, so maybe even .2 or so for the low end

2011-06-01T14:34:26  <janzert> maybe go with 1/8th, .125

2011-06-01T14:37:56  <McLeopold> you want the rate to change after an elimination?
2011-06-01T14:38:08  <janzert> no
2011-06-01T14:38:12  <McLeopold> good :)
2011-06-01T14:38:27  <McLeopold> land area will be higher for higher # of players
2011-06-01T14:38:43  <janzert> but I'm thinking about it in terms of how often a player gets a chance at a new ant assuming everyone is alive still
2011-06-01T14:38:50  <janzert> not in terms of land area
2011-06-01T14:39:02  <janzert> so I can't really give you a rate I'd like in terms of land area :)
2011-06-01T14:39:24  <McLeopold> how much land can 1 ant see?
2011-06-01T14:40:05  <janzert> don't even know what the vision radius is atm :/
2011-06-01T14:40:53  <olexs1> can someone from the team check my pull request?
2011-06-01T14:42:09  <McLeopold> 55
2011-06-01T14:42:22  <McLeopold> 1 ant sees 177 squares
2011-06-01T14:42:43  <McLeopold> olexs1: I don't know the language, sry
2011-06-01T14:43:18  <janzert> McLeopold: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/pull/140 ?
2011-06-01T14:43:23  <janzert> it's a website change
2011-06-01T14:43:25  <McLeopold> janzert: should we say an ant standing still should see food at a rate of 1 per 5-15 turns?
2011-06-01T14:45:02  <janzert> I don't know :) I want to say a bot given perfect conditions and everyone else in the game should be able to get a new ant from every 5-8 turns up to a little less than every turn
2011-06-01T14:45:58  <janzert> i.e. from somewhere around .125-.2 up to .8 or .9 food per player per turn :/
2011-06-01T14:46:38  <janzert> I'm not sure how to translate that feel into per ant area or land area

2011-06-01T14:48:47  <janzert> actually the low end could probably be lower than that, but less than 1 every 15 turns or so seems like a very slow and barren game
2011-06-01T14:49:58  <janzert> I guess that would translate into a much lower rate than an ant standing still seeing a food within 15 turns?
2011-06-01T14:51:04  <olexs1> bhasker: that's a bit of a weird behaviour right at the start :) almost saw the food to the left and then decided to go right back
2011-06-01T14:51:16  <bhasker> yea lol
2011-06-01T14:51:18  <bhasker> but it still won!
2011-06-01T14:51:34  <bhasker> my code remembers its last destination and unless it gets better orders
2011-06-01T14:51:37  <bhasker> will keep giong

2011-06-01T14:51:44  <bhasker> in this case it never saw any food
2011-06-01T14:51:54  <olexs1> heh
2011-06-01T14:51:54  <bhasker> and it always tracks to what it thinks is the closest edge locaiton
2011-06-01T14:51:59  <bhasker> so it just kept going back and forth
2011-06-01T14:52:06  <bhasker> will have to add some randomness in there
2011-06-01T14:52:21  <olexs1> I should improve spreading out in the beginning, my ants will mostly keep going all the same way instead of covering maximum area
2011-06-01T14:52:33  <bhasker> yea well i jsut added some code to do that
2011-06-01T14:52:44  <bhasker> so that they explore in all directions equally
2011-06-01T14:53:35  <bhasker> but this new code at least got rid of oscillation on the same two squares
2011-06-01T14:53:46  <bhasker> otherwise a lot of my ants just keep oscillating between two positions
2011-06-01T14:54:18  <olexs1> I had that when navigating to closest invisible square. got rid of it by changing invisible to unexplored
2011-06-01T14:54:41  <bhasker> hmm
2011-06-01T14:55:08  <olexs1> all squares are unexplored to start with, once a square is visible, it's marked as explored for the rest of the game
2011-06-01T14:56:04  <olexs1> later in the game this might result in suboptimal exploration, but at that point my bot is in a different mode altogether anyway
2011-06-01T14:59:14  <McLeopold> janzert: a game with very low food turns into a game where the bot with the best formations should win
2011-06-01T15:00:15  <janzert> hmm, I think it ends up more about luck of early exploration
2011-06-01T15:01:51  <janzert> and with less food it seems like there are less chances for the randomness to even out
2011-06-01T15:02:00  <McLeopold> 1 food per 1-8 turns per land_area/#players
2011-06-01T15:02:25  <McLeopold> with more food, the game results were more random
2011-06-01T15:03:57  <janzert> so 1 food per x turns per land area per player right?
2011-06-01T15:04:32  <McLeopold> thinking...
2011-06-01T15:05:49  <McLeopold> at 2000 turns, the high end would give us 18000 ants for a 9 player game
2011-06-01T15:05:59  <McLeopold> 1 per turn per player
2011-06-01T15:06:21  <janzert> doesn't the size of map effect it with that formulation though?
2011-06-01T15:06:30  <McLeopold> no

2011-06-01T15:06:50  <janzert> so what does the land area term effect?
2011-06-01T15:07:14  <McLeopold> ignore it :)
2011-06-01T15:07:18  <janzert> ok
2011-06-01T15:07:29  <McLeopold> you wanted a bot with perfect conditions to get 1 ant per turn at the high end
2011-06-01T15:07:33  <janzert> so it's really 1 food per x turns per player
2011-06-01T15:07:37  <McLeopold> yea
2011-06-01T15:08:37  <janzert> I'm thinking make the range of x between 1-10 now but yeah that looks good to me
2011-06-01T15:08:49  <McLeopold> I think that is just way to high
2011-06-01T15:08:55  <janzert> although 1 seems just a tad high it's probably fine occasionally
2011-06-01T15:09:33  <janzert> I really want the range to be fractional :P
2011-06-01T15:09:40  <McLeopold> it is :)
2011-06-01T15:09:59  <janzert> I mean 1 food per 1.2 turns per player
2011-06-01T15:10:10  <McLeopold> it is :D
2011-06-01T15:10:47  <McLeopold> 6 food per 5 turns, food_rate/food_turn
2011-06-01T15:11:29  <McLeopold> also, the lower food rates will be choosen more often right now
2011-06-01T15:11:38  <janzert> ahh, then I want a continuous range of 1.5 to 10 :)
2011-06-01T15:12:49  <McLeopold> with 9 players, that's 6 food per turn
2011-06-01T15:13:07  <janzert> on the high end yeah
2011-06-01T15:13:28  <janzert> and just under 1 food per turn on the low end
2011-06-01T15:13:30  <McLeopold> I'll try that out, but I think it is too high
2011-06-01T15:13:56  <McLeopold> do you mind the lower end being chosen more?
2011-06-01T15:16:16  <janzert> I wouldn't mind seeing less of either extreme
2011-06-01T15:16:30  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-06-01T15:17:15  <janzert> maybe a normal distribution over a range of 1 and 15?
2011-06-01T15:18:10  <McLeopold> so, you don't have to do as good in low and high end games?  I would think we want even distrubution
2011-06-01T15:18:12  <janzert> or rather normal distribution over a 99% range of 1 and 15
2011-06-01T15:18:49  <janzert> you do have to do as good in extreme conditions
2011-06-01T15:18:58  <janzert> err, don't have to do as good
2011-06-01T15:19:22  <McLeopold> but there will be less games with low and high end
2011-06-01T15:19:27  <janzert> but I could see going the other way too
2011-06-01T15:20:02  <janzert> right, that's why you don't need to do as well in the extreme's
2011-06-01T15:20:31  <McLeopold> I think we should encourage doing well in both extremes
2011-06-01T15:20:34  <janzert> I don't really have a strong feel one way or the other on distribution
2011-06-01T15:23:34  <janzert> I kinda think the extreme games may be the least interesting to watch though
2011-06-01T15:33:07  <janzert> is there a published clojure bot, that I could test with?

2011-06-01T15:36:26  <olexs1> berak: good point. another reason for me to rewrite what is now about 10 lines of initial exploration code :)
2011-06-01T15:38:23  <bhasker> fixed another bug with exploration hopefully my bot does a bit better and doesn't sit doing nothing
2011-06-01T15:38:25  <bhasker> for a few turns
2011-06-01T15:38:30  <bhasker> though i still see some ants do it
2011-06-01T15:39:16  <olexs1> bhasker: do you test locally? early game behaviour should be pretty easy to debug
2011-06-01T15:39:34  <bhasker> yea i do
2011-06-01T15:40:04  <bhasker> i think early game behaviour is fine, its later that ants get a little confused :)
2011-06-01T15:40:21  <bhasker> ouch latest submission flunked compilation
2011-06-01T15:40:21  <bhasker> hmm
2011-06-01T15:44:32  <olexs1> berak: actually, after looking at my code again, the way I implemented it ants wont get stuck... it's looking further out that its view range for unexplored squares, so after exploring the whole pocket, it'll get out again and go  somewhere else

2011-06-01T15:50:23  <berak> olexs1, just wanna say, if a game can take like 2000 turns, it's not wise to say: 'been there, seen that', situation might change..
2011-06-01T15:51:05  <olexs> berak: that is why I switch to a completely different logic at some point in the game, the "unexplored" system is only for the early phase
2011-06-01T15:51:39  <bhasker> my bot defines what i call a frontline
2011-06-01T15:52:05  <bhasker> of enemy ant squares/dead ants squares and squares which have either unexplored adjacent squares or squares that haven't been seen in some time
2011-06-01T15:52:11  <bhasker> then when an ant has nothing better to do
2011-06-01T15:52:16  <bhasker> it just routes to one of the frontline squares
2011-06-01T15:52:48  <Frontier> frontiers? :D
2011-06-01T15:52:49  <olexs> in later game, I have a grid of ants keeping fog of war away, and so-called "interest points", where most of the other ants go, as well as some micro-management when encountering enemies
2011-06-01T15:53:06  <bhasker> frontiers indeed:)
2011-06-01T15:53:40  <Frontier> olexs: what kind of grid do you use?
2011-06-01T15:53:59  <olexs> Frontier: hexagonal, to use minimal amount of ants for maximum view area
2011-06-01T15:54:36  <berak> hex grid, cool!
2011-06-01T15:54:59  <olexs> GreenTea had a similar idea it seems, only his is rectangular and much tighter than mine
2011-06-01T15:55:00  <Frontier> olexs: me too - in theory, implementation has to follow now
2011-06-01T15:55:30  <Frontier> well to be fair a lot of people realized that a grid might be useful
2011-06-01T15:55:30  <bhasker> random shuffle causing weird behaviour

2011-06-01T15:55:40  <olexs> Frontier: I use the viewradius var at game initialisation to calculate grid distance, and build it from there
2011-06-01T15:55:40  <bhasker> bots routing across each other lol
2011-06-01T15:55:42  <bhasker> ants*
2011-06-01T15:56:24  <olexs> my micro needs massive improvement though, I lose way more ants in battles than necessary...
2011-06-01T15:57:02  <Frontier> with the current maps we can do evil things in micro *hint*hint*
2011-06-01T15:58:04  <berak> Frontier, micro ?
2011-06-01T15:58:22  <bhasker> my bot does a bit of micro:)
2011-06-01T15:58:29  <bhasker> it does some smart battles if possible
2011-06-01T15:58:41  <olexs> at this point my micro-management is pretty much "am I alone ? ruuuuun : this is sparta!"
2011-06-01T15:58:42  <Frontier> but it doesn't do the evil I have in mind.
2011-06-01T16:00:26  <olexs> however, I have an idea how I can improve it massively... just too lazy to actually sit down and code it properly
2011-06-01T16:01:32  <aeter> Maybe a stupid question; can the locations of dead ants, given to the starter package, be the same as a location of an alive ant?
2011-06-01T16:01:50  <McLeopold> no
2011-06-01T16:02:06  <aeter> ok, thanks - wasn't sure.
2011-06-01T16:02:06  <McLeopold> you can't walk on food
2011-06-01T16:02:29  <McLeopold> any ants at a dead ant location would have been considered to "collide" with it and be dead also
2011-06-01T16:03:02  <McLeopold> what do you guys think about the starting food amounts?

2011-06-01T16:06:30  <bhasker> seems fine to me
2011-06-01T16:06:49  <berak> McLeopold, seems you just need longer games this way  ( since they all have to walk some time to find food ) 100 turns not enough
2011-06-01T16:06:50  <bhasker> makes bots a bit more interesting than a food gatherer
2011-06-01T16:07:31  <bhasker> and battles count now
2011-06-01T16:07:34  <berak> bhasker +1
2011-06-01T16:07:42  <bhasker> stupid battle logic will kill the bot very fast
2011-06-01T16:07:53  <olexs> a bit low for my taste. my bot loses some games just because he doesn't happen to come across a food piece in first few turns, and others do, by pure random
2011-06-01T16:08:03  <bhasker> that should not happen olex
2011-06-01T16:08:10  <bhasker> spawning is symmetric
2011-06-01T16:08:17  <bhasker> unless there was no food nearby
2011-06-01T16:08:17  <olexs> okay
2011-06-01T16:08:23  <bhasker> in which case yes there is some luck
2011-06-01T16:08:31  <McLeopold> I'm going to try and raise it a bit, so that a bot will on average see 1 food to start with
2011-06-01T16:08:43  <olexs> I observed that yesterday and earlier today, don't know if you changed something since then
2011-06-01T16:09:46  <Frontier> McLeopold: that would be good I think. The bots need a little kick start to get the game to the interesting phase

2011-06-01T16:15:56  <bhasker> ah
2011-06-01T16:16:03  <bhasker> simpler to just store the stream zipped?

2011-06-01T16:17:11  <olexs> 25:1
2011-06-01T16:17:16  <bhasker> oh the ant that didn't move
2011-06-01T16:17:20  <McLeopold> I suppose I could store it on the worker, then replay it if requested?
2011-06-01T16:17:23  * berak still wonders, why this go-bot, doing straight random is doing so fine

2011-06-01T16:17:34  <bhasker> i took one of his ants with me
2011-06-01T16:17:37  <bhasker> i didn't lose it
2011-06-01T16:17:41  <bhasker> even trade
2011-06-01T16:17:42  <olexs> okay :)
2011-06-01T16:17:48  <bhasker> i allow that
2011-06-01T16:17:51  <bhasker> explicitly
2011-06-01T16:17:52  <McLeopold> random does surprisingly well
2011-06-01T16:20:00  <berak> we need a rage-bot for this ;)
2011-06-01T16:20:31  <Frontier> McLeopold: I need to show you something, and you tell me what you think.
2011-06-01T16:20:38  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-01T16:21:00  <olexs> berak: HunterBot from python samples? :)
2011-06-01T16:21:50  <berak> i think, it's not the same idea
2011-06-01T16:22:21  <olexs> it always goes for closest food or enemy
2011-06-01T16:22:31  <berak> it does not show that kind of hate ;)
2011-06-01T16:25:18  <berak> since it does not distinguish between food and enemy
2011-06-01T16:25:28  <olexs> someone should upload it though, just to see how it does :)
2011-06-01T16:32:34  <berak> won't work here, in pw, you could win attacking in turn 1, (being daring), but here, you'll never see an opponent before ~ turn 50, and you're lucky finding food/spawning more ants before that
2011-06-01T16:32:41  <olexs> just done that... let's see whatever happens.
2011-06-01T16:32:57  <berak> ;)
2011-06-01T16:33:38  <olexs> it was actually fairly good among the test bots, at least until food got dialed back
2011-06-01T16:33:53  <olexs> argh, forgot to rename the executable
2011-06-01T16:34:07  <berak> most fun for me, in this beta-phase, is that's almost anything possible
2011-06-01T16:34:53  <olexs> ok, now it's in the contest, and I'm afk for a while

2011-06-01T17:02:44  <|UncleVasya|> It's Windows-only (works on my XP and I hope Vista in 7 will be ok too).
2011-06-01T17:02:46  <berak> GreenTea: i liked that idea of leaving some ants on a raster, to improve the vision, did you give up on this ?

2011-06-01T17:12:11  <berak> seems, you left some ants as a sitting duck, to keep that area within sight ( if there's food spawning there )
2011-06-01T17:15:13  <berak> in regula distance
2011-06-01T17:16:30  <GreenTea> this is good taktick when all food on map was eaten
2011-06-01T17:17:51  <GreenTea> I thought that food spawning randomly..
2011-06-01T17:17:58  <berak> yeah, like now, when new food  only happening rarely ;)

2011-06-01T18:59:25  <bhasker> so question, when a bot times out why does the replay get borked?
2011-06-01T19:00:56  <janzert> answer that and you can probably fix the problem :} I believe a further constraint on when the problem appears is only when the starting ant for that player is still alive
2011-06-01T19:01:36  <janzert> at least I think that is what Frontier tracked it down to

2011-06-01T19:12:54  <amstan> yeah, so what's the plan?
2011-06-01T19:13:08  <janzert> biggest thing missing for launch at this point is probably email sending

2011-06-01T19:15:08  <janzert> GreenTea: lol, soo close
2011-06-01T19:15:26  <janzert> gmail has a limit of 500 per day
2011-06-01T19:15:34  <j3camero> Oh wow.
2011-06-01T19:15:43  <j3camero> But makes sense if you only want humans using it.
2011-06-01T19:15:48  <janzert> I think the amazon mail service is probably the way to go
2011-06-01T19:15:53  <j3camero> Who sends more than 500 emails a day pff.
2011-06-01T19:15:56  <McLeopold> who's doing the hosting?  you just buy access to a relay
2011-06-01T19:15:58  <j3camero> Okay.
2011-06-01T19:16:43  <j3camero> Last time we were just sending mail right from my dedicated server's mail server. Surprisingly, hotmail and gmail seemed to accept our emails as valid and non-spam. Could we do that again? It's so free.
2011-06-01T19:17:19  <McLeopold> I brought this up before, but do we really need email other than for registering?
2011-06-01T19:17:36  <j3camero> Not at this point I don't think.
2011-06-01T19:17:49  <amstan> McLeopold: not really, not anymore, since we have the errors being displayed on the user page
2011-06-01T19:17:50  <McLeopold> Just lost password.  I don't even know if we have that.
2011-06-01T19:18:01  <amstan> no way to change passwords..
2011-06-01T19:18:21  <amstan> and i'm really not going to bother, anyone who loses their password must submit a patch to add the recovery feature, lol
2011-06-01T19:18:24  <janzert> if we are only sending registration/password reset emails I don't think we'll hit amazons free limit of 2000 free emails
2011-06-01T19:18:34  <amstan> janzert: /day?
2011-06-01T19:18:42  <janzert> yes
2011-06-01T19:18:46  <amstan> oh, decent
2011-06-01T19:18:51  <j3camero> Oh wait yeah. The compile status emails. We may be able to do without those, especially since people's entries are being compiled by the workers.

2011-06-01T19:22:49  *** GreenTea <GreenTea!55c69c0c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.198.156.12> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-06-01T19:23:07  <j3camero> What if the compiler output is really long? Does it get truncated to the first few lines?
2011-06-01T19:23:24  <McLeopold> first 1024 chars
2011-06-01T19:23:52  <amstan> j3camero: people are supposed to test their bots locally anyway, the functional test is included in the tools download
2011-06-01T19:23:56  <j3camero> Oh solid. Did you check with a few languages' compilers to make sure that will usually be enough?
2011-06-01T19:24:15  <amstan> nobody tested that that i know
2011-06-01T19:24:18  <McLeopold> no, but we've got most language in the system with no complaints
2011-06-01T19:24:28  <j3camero> Okay.
2011-06-01T19:25:05  <j3camero> In practice, most people will happily use the site as their compiler. Hopefully people will be able to get somewhat clear error messages from the site.
2011-06-01T19:25:21  <amstan> McLeopold: maybe we should do tail instead?
2011-06-01T19:25:30  <amstan> i know python gives the most relevant error at the end
2011-06-01T19:25:40  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-06-01T19:25:50  <janzert> amstan: but for C/++ you want the head :(
2011-06-01T19:26:00  <janzert> I was thinking about that before
2011-06-01T19:26:01  <McLeopold> but I want to encourage people not to fill up stderr, so I went with head
2011-06-01T19:26:04  <amstan> first 512 and last 512?
2011-06-01T19:26:11  <j3camero> Maybe a head/tail thing. 1024 from the head, 1024 from the tail. Unless it's less than 2048.
2011-06-01T19:27:08  <janzert> what is there now is probably fine for the moment though
2011-06-01T19:27:17  <j3camero> For sure.
2011-06-01T19:27:22  <janzert> McLeopold: what do you think of changing the serial game option to an integer on how many bots to run in parallel?
2011-06-01T19:27:46  <McLeopold> support is already in engine
2011-06-01T19:27:50  <McLeopold> sure
2011-06-01T19:28:05  <McLeopold> but, will in make a difference?
2011-06-01T19:28:23  <janzert> I want to run as many bots in parallel as there are cores on the worker
2011-06-01T19:28:38  <janzert> I've actually got it fleshed out in the engine right now
2011-06-01T19:28:42  <j3camero> How sensitive are the workers to the Ubuntu version? Do they need a specific version of Ubuntu?
2011-06-01T19:28:48  <amstan> j3camero: yes, natty
2011-06-01T19:28:48  <janzert> just not at all tested :/
2011-06-01T19:28:54  <j3camero> Okay.
2011-06-01T19:29:30  <amstan> there's quite a few things that had to be hardcoded and that change between ubuntu versions
2011-06-01T19:30:04  <j3camero> We could try upping the games/minute by using boxes owned by us and other IRC people as workers in addition to the EC2 workers. good idea/bad idea?
2011-06-01T19:30:16  <janzert> bad idea
2011-06-01T19:30:21  <janzert> ;)
2011-06-01T19:30:24  <j3camero> Haha okay.
2011-06-01T19:30:31  <j3camero> Why? Different specs would cause problems?
2011-06-01T19:30:54  <janzert> yeah, I think people will really complain about having differences in different workers
2011-06-01T19:31:11  <bhasker> all these starter bots are annoying :-\
2011-06-01T19:31:34  <janzert> there was a fair amount of complaining about having games on the main server and workers while that was happening last time
2011-06-01T19:35:30  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=10561
2011-06-01T19:35:44  <bhasker> interesting game frontier
2011-06-01T19:35:57  <bhasker> though my bot's exploration logic is oor
2011-06-01T19:35:58  <bhasker> poor*
2011-06-01T19:36:27  <amstan> how do you do against the square dancer?
2011-06-01T19:36:35  <bhasker> who is that
2011-06-01T19:37:32  <amstan> he was 5th a while ago
2011-06-01T19:40:55  <janzert> McLeopold: is anyone actively working on the engine at this point?
2011-06-01T19:41:18  <McLeopold> I'm working on ants.py, not engine.py
2011-06-01T19:42:26  <janzert> ok, I've got serial mode changed to allow a set number of bots at a time
2011-06-01T19:42:51  <McLeopold> janzert: I thought it was already there?
2011-06-01T19:42:57  <janzert> not quite
2011-06-01T19:43:23  <janzert> the basis for it was, but it could only handle everyone at once or one at a time
2011-06-01T19:43:37  <McLeopold> oh, yeah, I see the TODO's now
2011-06-01T19:44:07  <McLeopold> did you suffle the bot order ;)
2011-06-01T19:44:12  <j3camero> So amstan. Do you feel like being a director of a corporation? :-P
2011-06-01T19:44:23  <CIA-48> aichallenge: janzert epsilon * recb0178 / worker/engine.py : Allow a restricted number of bots at once in serial mode - http://bit.ly/lIUwnC
2011-06-01T19:44:33  <janzert> shuffle I did :)
2011-06-01T19:45:36  <janzert> the next thing that is bugging me is that all the bots are kept in one list for the whole time and it constantly has to be checked if a bot is alive or not
2011-06-01T19:46:16  <janzert> but I'll probably just leave that for now
2011-06-01T19:46:47  <McLeopold> I think we did that so the numbers don't get off
2011-06-01T19:47:18  <janzert> yeah, I'd just give them an explicit player number
2011-06-01T19:47:59  <janzert> also that way the numbers don't have to passed around separately
2011-06-01T19:48:37  <janzert> but I'll not touch it right now
2011-06-01T19:53:56  *** Kingpin13 <Kingpin13!~Kingpin13@Wikipedia/Kingpin13> has quit IRC (Quit: time to go)
2011-06-01T19:56:31  <janzert> I wonder if people would prefer .5GB of memory and 1.3 times more processing power or 1GB of memory and less processing power
2011-06-01T19:57:44  <janzert> oops, that's actually not a choice :}
2011-06-01T20:00:08  <janzert> it's basically 1GB of memory per bot and 1.3x times processing power for each turn but a quarter the throughput (in games per unit of time) (2 cores instead of 8)
2011-06-01T20:00:25  <olexs> 1gb memory per bot? that's a lot
2011-06-01T20:00:36  <j3camero> Are the bots memory-limited in some hard way?
2011-06-01T20:00:40  <janzert> yes
2011-06-01T20:01:01  <j3camero> Oh nice. Using the same shady sandbox that I cobbled together last contest?
2011-06-01T20:01:03  <janzert> currently the sandbox is set to just over a 1GB limit
2011-06-01T20:01:15  <janzert> not quite
2011-06-01T20:01:16  <j3camero> That should be plenty haha.
2011-06-01T20:01:24  <janzert> built off of it though
2011-06-01T20:01:25  <McLeopold> were passing language specific params as well
2011-06-01T20:01:45  <janzert> it chroots the sandboxed process
2011-06-01T20:01:54  <j3camero> Oh nice. More condoms.
2011-06-01T20:02:40  <j3camero> And the language-specific treatment should really help. The sandbox tends to irritate users of some languages more than others.
2011-06-01T20:02:43  <janzert> I'm not completely sure java will start with a smaller hard limit even with giving the lower memory options
2011-06-01T20:03:00  <janzert> guess I should test that
2011-06-01T20:03:13  <McLeopold> janzert: so far, I think you're right because java is still crashing on turn 1
2011-06-01T20:03:25  <McLeopold> We need to test on a real server
2011-06-01T20:04:37  <janzert> java is such a pain, too bad it's so popular :P
2011-06-01T20:04:46  <j3camero> Okay, so I need to do a ton of paperwork before we can get mega google money (or Facebook or Amazon or whatever)
2011-06-01T20:05:24  <j3camero> So I don't know what to do about that. Ideally we would be able to light up a few servers right now to get things rolling.
2011-06-01T20:05:46  <McLeopold> do the paperwork?
2011-06-01T20:05:56  <j3camero> Yep, working on that now!
2011-06-01T20:06:23  <j3camero> What would it cost per month to light up a web server and two workers at this time?
2011-06-01T20:07:16  <j3camero> I just need a ballpark idea what each worker costs per month basically.
2011-06-01T20:07:23  <j3camero> All-in.
2011-06-01T20:08:19  <CIA-48> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * rc13ff98 / (4 files in 3 dirs): update to ensure ants have starting food, upped food amounts - http://bit.ly/iOPYNa

2011-06-01T20:09:42  <janzert> webserver at most $0.34 per hour and worker at most $0.25 per hour on ec2 for both
2011-06-01T20:10:13  <janzert> so ~245 for server and 180 per worker
2011-06-01T20:10:23  <j3camero> My current plan is to basically start funding the contest out of pocket (given my stable employment and low expenses and such) and then have the corporation pay me back once it's set up. That will be good because it will make me actually do stuff. If I don't, I won't get paid back :-)
2011-06-01T20:10:33  <janzert> that's maximum amount basically
2011-06-01T20:10:37  <j3camero> Okay that's reasonable. Thanks janzert.
2011-06-01T20:11:10  <janzert> I haven't really decided what instance type is best bang for the buck for workers still
2011-06-01T20:11:15  <j3camero> So 600 per month for the server and two workers, to get started.
2011-06-01T20:11:40  <janzert> yeah, that would do it for sure
2011-06-01T20:12:01  <j3camero> I think ultimately we will be able to raise whatever cash we need. So we don't have to be stingy. The concern is purely from an engineering point of view, which instance type gives us the best games/minute/dollar.
2011-06-01T20:12:27  <janzert> also I do worry about the instance stability for the main server though
2011-06-01T20:12:42  <j3camero> We don't have to use EC2 if it's a problem.
2011-06-01T20:12:57  <j3camero> The web server is the only thing that really has to stay up.
2011-06-01T20:13:11  <janzert> yeah, I'm thinking a more traditional server for the webserver might be better
2011-06-01T20:13:16  <janzert> say linode or something
2011-06-01T20:13:38  <j3camero> Yep. What does that mean for the cost of sending data in and out of ec2?
2011-06-01T20:13:48  <j3camero> I assume that's pretty light.
2011-06-01T20:14:06  <j3camero> Game assignments go out, results come back in. Here I am assuming that the database is with the web server.
2011-06-01T20:14:30  <janzert> I don't think it should be huge, it's basically $0.10 per GB in and $0.15 per GB out
2011-06-01T20:14:43  <j3camero> Okay that should be practically nothing.
2011-06-01T20:15:04  <janzert> yeah, the instance cost should completely out weigh that I'm pretty sure
2011-06-01T20:15:36  <j3camero> Cool cool.

2011-06-01T20:17:10  <j3camero> In the past I have done pretty extensive stress testing before launching. I think we should light up an instance on real servers, then use scripts to create a few thousand accounts and submit thousands of bots that all behave differently. We can try a few scenarios to make sure that the whole house of cards doesnt blow over when we launch.
