2010-09-21T00:06:04  <sigh> does your bot often attack enemies far away in preference to closer targets?
2010-09-21T00:07:12  <bss03> No, it likes closer targets.  It will "just" continue a drawn-out contest for a hostile planet when it would be better off doing more expansion onto neutral planets.
2010-09-21T00:07:36  <Snowplan> thanks sigh
2010-09-21T00:07:38  <sigh> hmm... ok, I'm probably misunderstanding something then

2010-09-21T00:15:30  <bss03> Zarathust: I think the suggestion for getting extra debug information is to write stuff to a file.
2010-09-21T00:15:57  <bss03> Zarathust: PlayGame.jar seems to swallow stdout and stderr from your program, but opening a file and logging to that should work.
2010-09-21T00:16:01  <Zarathust> Yes i already do this
2010-09-21T00:16:14  <Zarathust> But stepping through the engine could be better

2010-09-21T02:37:28  <boegel> I can easily tell, because my old bot didn't work at all, this is my first somewhat decent submission

2010-09-21T02:38:44  <boegel> how long does it take for the system to pick up the new version?
2010-09-21T02:39:12  <antimatroid1> should be pretty much straight away, but it's hardly giving out games atm
2010-09-21T02:39:17  <boegel> is it possible that it was playing with the older version during the submission, and that it'll take those odl results into account?

2010-09-21T02:39:39  <antimatroid1> and your elo is pretty much wiped everytime you resubmit

2010-09-21T02:41:20  <boegel> in this game, the system is definitely using my old bot: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4615883
2010-09-21T02:41:29  <boegel> and it was played after my most recent submission
2010-09-21T02:41:43  <boegel> antimatroid1: is it possible a game was in play *during* my submission?
2010-09-21T02:42:04  <Zannick> haha, that would be a terrible race
2010-09-21T02:42:05  <boegel> because the game result came in just 12s after my submission
2010-09-21T02:42:17  <boegel> Zannick: yeah, my old bot was utter crap, full of bugs
2010-09-21T02:42:19  <Zannick> i wonder if it does...
2010-09-21T02:42:26  <Zannick> no, i mean race condition
2010-09-21T02:42:42  <antimatroid1> boegel: it would wipe any old games when you resubmit (or at least that's waht it's done for me)
2010-09-21T02:43:01  <boegel> Zannick: ah, ok
2010-09-21T02:43:31  <boegel> well, the version it's playing doesn't match with what I'm seeing locally, so my best guess is that it's playind the old version
2010-09-21T02:44:33  <Zannick> well, the 12s thing is also a good indicator it might be
2010-09-21T02:45:52  <boegel> Zannick: I thought so too
2010-09-21T02:46:16  <boegel> antimatroid1: the benzedrine version allows you to play as many games as you want in a short period of time?
2010-09-21T02:46:28  <boegel> antimatroid1: and thus get a quick estimate of the quality of your bot?
2010-09-21T02:47:31  <boegel> antimatroid1: how does it know if you're playing a new version? the ranking is cumulative, I assume, no matter which version you're using?

2010-09-21T06:04:08  <mega1> aerique: the exit code of sbcl is 1 on error (when --disable-debugger)
2010-09-21T06:04:28  <aerique> mega1: that's good no?
2010-09-21T06:04:34  <mega1> so stderr can be simply redirected to stdout to see all the notes
2010-09-21T06:04:49  <mega1> (which I'd get in the email from the server)
2010-09-21T06:05:13  <mega1> I have to check if the server actually checks the exit code.

2010-09-21T06:05:41  <aerique> mega1: my impressions is it simply checks for output on stderr but i'd have to look at the code
2010-09-21T06:06:04  <aerique> perhaps Janzert knows :)
2010-09-21T06:07:28  <mega1> def check_path(path):

2010-09-21T06:07:44  <mega1> and it's called with "MyBot"
2010-09-21T06:07:59  <mega1> so no, it doesn't check the exit code but we are still good

2010-09-21T08:35:29  <antimatroid1> hmmm, with so much variation of bots on different maps, would it work better if each time bots were paired, they had a match off on a few maps to decide which one was the winner/loser out of them?

2010-09-21T08:38:29  <HakanD> i have categorized maps based on distance of neutrals, enemy home etc, and choosing different strategies for each
2010-09-21T08:39:12  <antimatroid1> i am, i'm just pondering ways of better ranking bots
2010-09-21T08:40:21  <HakanD> yep, sth needs to be done about ranking
2010-09-21T08:41:15  <HakanD> at least for final round
2010-09-21T08:41:38  <antimatroid1> problem is you may always end up with some cyclic kind of preferences
2010-09-21T08:41:47  <antimatroid1> which makes it hard to give a perfect ranking
2010-09-21T08:42:01  <antimatroid1> but i still think it could be improved upon what it's doing currently

2010-09-21T09:51:15  <MrCeeJ> I have a question about 'fair play'. it is probably better on the forums but I thought i'd ask here anyway. When moving ships from a->b to reinforce, moving 50 ships in 50 1 ship fleets is obviously going to cause more pain for other bots than one single fleet, but is clearly not making your bot any stronger tactically, just exploiting a possible weakness of your opponent (i.e. bad sportsmanship)... is it against the rules / spirit of the competition? (
2010-09-21T09:52:05  <bartwe> MrCeeJ: have you checked if the game server doesn't combine those attacks ?
2010-09-21T09:52:19  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure they fixed this

2010-09-21T09:52:43  <MrCeeJ> No i didn't want to implement it. I read they removed size 0 fleets, but there was a comment to the effect of 'size 1 and greater fleets are fleets'

2010-09-21T09:57:17  <antimatroid1> that's fine, but a rather stupid tactic imo

2010-09-21T10:02:28  <MrCeeJ> I was more concerned about the unknown processing power of the servers and the 1sec rule. 21 planets with 20 fleets generated per turn for the last 10 turns is 4000, if you then parse that list for each of you 20 planets you have 80,000 iterations of your loop to get through

2010-09-21T10:13:45  <bartwe> hi
2010-09-21T10:13:52  <bartwe> i need some suggestions for my bot
2010-09-21T10:14:00  <bartwe> the .10 series is not really beating the .8 series
2010-09-21T10:14:00  <antimatroid1> haha
2010-09-21T10:14:09  <bartwe> and i'm losing momentum ....
2010-09-21T10:14:09  <antimatroid1> .11 seems pretty good :P
2010-09-21T10:14:24  <bartwe> antimatroid1: .11 is worse then .8 and also, not mine
2010-09-21T10:14:40  <antimatroid1> that last part was the point ;)
2010-09-21T10:15:16  <bartwe> geh,
2010-09-21T10:15:24  <bartwe> do you guys model coordinated strikes ?
2010-09-21T10:15:35  <sigh> bartwe: I do
2010-09-21T10:15:49  <bartwe> how do you model somethign like that ?
2010-09-21T10:16:04  <bartwe> even picking the fleet seems very combinatorial
2010-09-21T10:16:14  <sigh> I do loop over each destination planet and decide the best way of attacking it

2010-09-21T10:16:25  <sigh> where that attack can involve multiple sources
2010-09-21T10:17:02  <sigh> I do each destination independently and score them based on the cost of attacking them, distance and other factors
2010-09-21T10:17:45  *** xvinyl <xvinyl!~xvinyl@AVelizy-153-1-17-224.w83-199.abo.wanadoo.fr> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-09-21T10:18:30  <sigh> previous to that I looped over all sources and picked the best destination to send ships to, that was much simpler but didn't allow as sophisticated attacks
2010-09-21T10:20:06  <antimatroid1> sigh: i do much the same, but it feels way to sub optimal to do well later
2010-09-21T10:20:33  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to work out ways to solve the problem better, but it gets complicated with fleets being 0 or above x
2010-09-21T10:21:17  <sigh> antimatroid1: sure, but I'm no where near reaching the potential of this current approach
2010-09-21T10:21:39  <antimatroid1> yeah neither, my point is the above is what i see as that key :P
2010-09-21T10:22:11  <bartwe> one issue with coordinated strikes is the combination of timing and reevaluation of not yet departed fleet bits of a strike
2010-09-21T10:22:19  <bartwe> i see no good way to model that
2010-09-21T10:22:45  <antimatroid1> you can compute a surprising amount :P
2010-09-21T10:22:51  <sigh> :)
2010-09-21T10:23:26  <sigh> bartwe: example of my coordinated attacks, see the end of this game: http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4615907
2010-09-21T10:23:51  <sigh> last 15 moves or so when I take the last planets
2010-09-21T10:23:56  <bartwe> the timing seems off
2010-09-21T10:24:22  <sigh> a bit, enemy does stuff in the mean time to screw up timing, and I have bugs too
2010-09-21T10:24:58  <MrCeeJ> the neutral 44 you take on turn 29/30, you hit first with 24 then with 27 a turn later
2010-09-21T10:25:09  <MrCeeJ> possibly not rounding up the distance ?
2010-09-21T10:26:13  <sigh> MrCeeJ: nah, it wont be a rounding error... it's either a bug, or I'm being over defensive
2010-09-21T10:26:34  <sigh> probably bug :)
2010-09-21T10:26:54  <sigh> point I wanted to illustrate was the coordinated attack, not the timing :P
2010-09-21T10:27:05  <sigh> so stop picking on me :D
2010-09-21T10:27:08  <MrCeeJ> :p
2010-09-21T10:27:08  <bartwe> hehe
2010-09-21T10:27:13  <bartwe> looks great
2010-09-21T10:27:18  <bartwe> how do you pick the sources ?
2010-09-21T10:27:29  <sigh> secret atm :P
2010-09-21T10:27:32  <MrCeeJ> I was under the impression that the coordination (timing) was the point :p
2010-09-21T10:28:04  <sigh> MrCeeJ: timing is more of a detail... the hard part is getting different source planets to act in unison

2010-09-21T10:29:03  <sigh> if you know what sources you want to use, then it is easy to brute force possible timings
2010-09-21T10:29:12  <MrCeeJ> it is only a matter of perspective, you can look at all the sources and pick a destination, or you can look at all the destinations and pick a (combination of) sources
2010-09-21T10:29:23  <sigh> *easy being relative here
2010-09-21T10:29:23  <kunaljain> if you are out of turn, then which player wins ? The player with more number of planets or more number of Army ?
2010-09-21T10:29:33  <MrCeeJ> army size
2010-09-21T10:29:47  <kunaljain> MrCeeJ: thanks
2010-09-21T10:29:52  <antimatroid1> those are sort of dual problems
2010-09-21T10:29:57  <bartwe> kunaljain: very hard to have superior army size at move 200 without a equal or better planet position
2010-09-21T10:30:08  <antimatroid1> in that they're really the same, and you don't necessarily have to lose that detail doing the former
2010-09-21T10:30:25  <bartwe> sigh: does coordinated strikes reduce or increase the complexity of moving units forward ?
2010-09-21T10:30:40  <sigh> moving units forward?
2010-09-21T10:30:49  <sigh> like redistributing them?
2010-09-21T10:30:59  <bartwe> yes, into a position of influence
2010-09-21T10:31:13  <sigh> for me those two part of the code are completely independant
2010-09-21T10:31:28  <sigh> *completely is an approximation
2010-09-21T10:31:43  <sigh> so it doesn't really impact me, but that's just my approach

2010-09-21T10:33:27  <bartwe> so do you reevaluate the sending of units in a coordinated strike for which the initial units are inflight ?
2010-09-21T10:34:12  <sigh> bartwe: at the moment my bot has no notion of state... it doesn't remember that the previous move it wanted to do a coordinated strike :P
2010-09-21T10:34:57  <sigh> It will be a long time before I change that, because making my bot stateful will make testing and debugging much harder

2010-09-21T12:38:07  <jmcarthur> my bot is going to be trivially parallelizable. i'm debating whether i should use more than one core for the tcp server
2010-09-21T12:38:18  <jmcarthur> maybe i could just have my bot under a different name for that
2010-09-21T12:39:36  <phreeza> jmcarthur: the real contest only allows 1 thread though, right?
2010-09-21T12:39:51  <phreeza> or was it 1 process
2010-09-21T12:39:58  <jesionaj> both
2010-09-21T12:40:46  <jmcarthur> yeah the real one only allows a single thread
2010-09-21T12:41:13  <jmcarthur> although i'm not entirely sure whether that's enforced technically, i will not be exploiting that
2010-09-21T12:41:34  <jmcarthur> wish i could though. it would give me a significant advantage

2010-09-21T12:45:34  <jmcarthur> for me it's just a matter of building with -threaded and running with +RTS -N (or i could wrap it with a C main and have those flags passed to the haskell runtime automatically)
2010-09-21T12:45:42  <jmcarthur> this of course depends on getting to upload a binary
2010-09-21T12:46:48  <jmcarthur> wish i had more than two cores at my disposal for the tcp server
2010-09-21T12:47:32  <jmcarthur> i have a nettop with a dual core Atom that has hyperthreading, making it 4 virtual cpus, but i doubt it would really be much faster if at all

2010-09-21T13:28:44  * dufflebunk hasn't done much multi-threaded haskell

2010-09-21T13:29:57  <jmcarthur> dufflebunk: what i ended up doing was sharing a couples MVars with the SIGALRM signal handler, last time

2010-09-21T13:30:34  <a1k0n> if only i had a machine fast enough to play it
2010-09-21T13:30:35  <jmcarthur> dufflebunk: when the signal is received it waits for the worker to finish its current iteration, grabs the current result, then pushes it to another MVar that the IO thread is waiting on
2010-09-21T13:30:52  <jmcarthur> then the IO thread pushes back to the worker thread when it's done
2010-09-21T13:31:06  <HakanD> if only i have time enough to play it :)
2010-09-21T13:31:09  <jmcarthur> in fact, i had the IO thread push back to the worker between sending orders and receiving the next game state
2010-09-21T13:31:14  <HakanD> enough time-
2010-09-21T13:31:16  <dufflebunk> shul: yeah, no OS threads so it should be fine
2010-09-21T13:31:22  <jmcarthur> and then grab it back again when the next state update is received
2010-09-21T13:31:38  <jmcarthur> so it was really working all the time except during actual IO and during signal handling

2010-09-21T13:49:23  <ntroPi> because noone _really_ understands their heuristics for choosing planets ;)

2010-09-21T14:34:42  <jmcarthur> this is the first time i've used this repa library. purely functional regular arrays are taking some time to get used to, but so far it's pretty cool
2010-09-21T14:35:09  <jmcarthur> i'm not used to indexing being so abstracted, is the main mental stumbling block i'm having
2010-09-21T14:37:12  <jmcarthur> for example, replication along any dimension is just an indexing transformation rather than an actual copy, so my function for precomputing planet distances basically replicates the array of coordinates twice, along two different dimensions, then applies the distance computation element-wise to "both" arrays (although there is actually only one, just with different indexing transformations under
2010-09-21T14:37:14  <jmcarthur> two different names)

2010-09-21T14:48:06  <McLeopold> I thought it was the mean - confidence?
2010-09-21T14:48:12  <jmcarthur> no, it's just mean
2010-09-21T14:48:20  <jmcarthur> i have been pushing for the lower confidence bound

2010-09-21T14:48:27  <McLeopold> That puts me at less ease. :)
2010-09-21T14:48:49  <McLeopold> It makes more sense when you begin.  Start at the bottom.
2010-09-21T14:49:07  <McLeopold> After you are established, it can be tricky.
2010-09-21T14:49:16  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: it could be that you have a very tight confidence interval, which would mean that games affect your rank less
2010-09-21T14:50:19  <jmcarthur> i agree. i don't care if it takes a while to get to the top. in fact, i think that is better
2010-09-21T14:50:36  <McLeopold> I see. So I could be 3530-3534, and kcm could be 3520-3602 or something.
2010-09-21T14:50:49  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-21T14:50:57  <McLeopold> My lower bound could be higher, but not the mean.

2010-09-21T17:16:29  <dufflebunk> right, Int64, maybe too big for that too. I'll just skip that section. It'll just cause at most one incorrect calculation per year.
2010-09-21T17:17:05  <Zannick> why does your bot need such a number?
2010-09-21T17:17:56  <dufflebunk> I'm making sure the (green) thread doesn't go over 900 ms, and the time library gives me differences in a silly structure

2010-09-21T17:57:15  <retybok_> I've found that fixing bugs improve performance a lot more than implementing new features :)
2010-09-21T17:57:21  <retybok_> but it's not as much fun :)
2010-09-21T17:57:40  <Naktibalda> hmm, that's good, looks like I have a lot of them
2010-09-21T17:58:33  <seon> what are the bugs?
2010-09-21T18:00:07  <Naktibalda> for example: sending more ships then necesarry

2010-09-21T18:00:58  <Naktibalda> yesterday I discovered, that I clean targets list at the wrong level of nested loops, so it sends multiple fleets of the same size if there are enough

2010-09-21T18:01:45  <seon> Naktibalda> do you prefer to send more ships?
2010-09-21T18:01:46  <Naktibalda> now I see that my planet size calculator after capturing works wrong, so it sends not enough ships to get a cheap capture

2010-09-21T18:02:16  <Naktibalda> no, I prefer to attack more targets at the same time :)
2010-09-21T18:03:17  <Naktibalda> another bug that I see, is that if one planet is under attack, another planet sends multiple fleets at the same turn.

2010-09-21T19:27:07  <pacotabaco> for ex: if some one win in 50 turns get more ELO points than if he do it in 200?

2010-09-21T19:27:46  <jmcarthur> all wins count the same

2010-09-21T21:38:59  <Naktibalda> what to visualize? you can watch  games in server
2010-09-21T21:39:41  <Snowplan> 945 now, no real AI work in my bot. Thought a rough version of my bot would at least be around 500

2010-09-21T21:51:10  <Snowplan> why is the tcp server so much better then the waterloo one
2010-09-21T21:51:57  <dufflebunk> the waterloo one has 1400 bots to play against each other
2010-09-21T21:52:02  <jmcarthur> it's a completely different architecture with completely different goals
2010-09-21T21:52:34  <jmcarthur> dufflebunk: 1884 bots, actually
2010-09-21T21:53:37  <jmcarthur> a single round robin would require over 3.5 million games
2010-09-21T21:53:45  <jmcarthur> and this number is still climbing
2010-09-21T21:53:56  <dufflebunk> s/1400/more bots than I can count on my fingers and toes/
2010-09-21T21:53:56  <jmcarthur> oh i did that math very wrong though
2010-09-21T21:54:16  <jmcarthur> my bad, "only" 1.8 million games
2010-09-21T21:54:20  <Snowplan> lol
2010-09-21T21:54:34  <Snowplan> any idea on the prize yet
2010-09-21T21:54:47  * jmcarthur shrugs
2010-09-21T21:54:55  <jmcarthur> the prize could end up just being fame and glory

2010-09-21T22:10:07  <MarcAndrePC> lol I made a stupid bot and rank 228, but the work to make it better is so much bigger O_o
2010-09-21T22:11:55  <Snowplan> I want to make a bot that can be stable in 300.  Def pat yourself on the back
2010-09-21T22:13:01  <Naktibalda> everyone is making his bot better
2010-09-21T22:14:36  <Naktibalda> what is AI actually?
2010-09-21T22:14:39  <jimmerton> is there a way to make the simulator quicker?
2010-09-21T22:14:45  <jimmerton> it takes a couple of seconds per game on my machine
2010-09-21T22:14:48  <Snowplan> why?
2010-09-21T22:14:52  <jimmerton> seems very slow
2010-09-21T22:14:59  <jimmerton> to run through a few hundred games
2010-09-21T22:15:15  <Naktibalda> jimmerton: make your bot faster :)
2010-09-21T22:15:33  <jimmerton> hah, you think it's my bot that's slow?
2010-09-21T22:15:37  <Naktibalda> how many turns your games last?
2010-09-21T22:15:38  <jimmerton> I assumed it was the game engine
2010-09-21T22:15:43  <jimmerton> 100-odd
2010-09-21T22:16:14  <jmcarthur> are you talking about the engine or the visualizer?
2010-09-21T22:16:18  <jimmerton> the engine
2010-09-21T22:16:32  <jmcarthur> maybe try one of the c++ engines from the forums?
2010-09-21T22:16:33  <jimmerton> java -jar tools/PlayGame
2010-09-21T22:16:37  <jimmerton> ah I didn't see those
2010-09-21T22:16:41  <jimmerton> I'll try one
2010-09-21T22:16:41  <Naktibalda> couple of seconds for a game is very fast, you are allowed to use 1 second per turn
2010-09-21T22:16:42  <jmcarthur> there's at least one
2010-09-21T22:16:51  <jmcarthur> not sure if the Qt one is also c++ (probably is)
2010-09-21T22:16:52  <Snowplan> mine sucks
2010-09-21T22:17:00  <jimmerton> my bot is pretty stupid Naktibalda
2010-09-21T22:17:06  <jimmerton> so it should be quick
2010-09-21T22:17:11  <Naktibalda> what language is it?
2010-09-21T22:17:22  <jimmerton> python
2010-09-21T22:17:33  <jmcarthur> my bot is going to run full game simulations many times per turn, so i'm working hard to make it pretty fast
2010-09-21T22:18:18  <jimmerton> how many turns into the future are you expecting to simulate?
2010-09-21T22:18:29  <Naktibalda> why do you want to make it faster? It takes me a few minutes to analyze 1 game
2010-09-21T22:18:47  <jimmerton> for bulk testing
2010-09-21T22:18:53  <Snowplan> I want my bot to eventually realize this game is trivial and pursue global dominations
2010-09-21T22:19:03  <jimmerton> sometimes I run a new version against all the bots on all the maps
2010-09-21T22:19:14  <jimmerton> it takes about 10 minutes
2010-09-21T22:19:27  <jimmerton> I'd like it to be quicker
2010-09-21T22:19:44  <jmcarthur> jimmerton: i'm simulating all the way to the end of the match, just not all possible matches
2010-09-21T22:20:26  <jmcarthur> as in, there is no branching factor
2010-09-21T22:20:42  <jimmerton> how is there any value in that?
2010-09-21T22:20:49  <jmcarthur> i shan't tell
2010-09-21T22:20:53  <jimmerton> heh, ok
2010-09-21T22:21:03  <jimmerton> are you assuming the enemy will do what your bot would do?
2010-09-21T22:21:09  <jmcarthur> not at all
2010-09-21T22:21:26  <jmcarthur> i am making no assumptions about the enemy, actually
2010-09-21T22:21:37  <Snowplan> good to know
2010-09-21T22:21:57  <jimmerton> I can't see much value in evaluating branches which are unlikely to occur
2010-09-21T22:22:13  <jmcarthur> i assure you there is. i'm just not going to say what
2010-09-21T22:23:21  <jimmerton> do you have a bot in the competition?
2010-09-21T22:23:26  <Snowplan> I think a real AI thinks on its own thats why I'm running through cases to implement an indefinate strategy
2010-09-21T22:23:47  <jmcarthur> not yet
2010-09-21T22:24:07  <jimmerton> I'm just hand coding sensible strategy for now
2010-09-21T22:24:15  <jimmerton> I'll look at proper ai methods later
2010-09-21T22:24:21  <jimmerton> when I have better understanding of the game myself
2010-09-21T22:24:24  <jmcarthur> heh, "proper"
2010-09-21T22:24:27  <jmcarthur> no such thing
2010-09-21T22:24:40  <jimmerton> what I mean is
2010-09-21T22:24:44  <jimmerton> machine learning algorithms
2010-09-21T22:24:48  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-21T22:24:52  <jmcarthur> that's an unusual approach

2010-09-21T22:25:03  <jimmerton> do you think so?
2010-09-21T22:25:06  <Snowplan> anyone use linux
2010-09-21T22:25:14  <jmcarthur> <-- uses linux
2010-09-21T22:25:25  <jimmerton> I'm planning on hand coding most of the strategy and tweaking the value functions using machine learning
2010-09-21T22:25:30  <jimmerton> linux and os x, what's up?
2010-09-21T22:25:33  <Snowplan> It's actially awsome
2010-09-21T22:25:33  <jmcarthur> jimmerton: yeah. the last contest was won by search algorithms
2010-09-21T22:25:41  <Snowplan> actually
2010-09-21T22:25:41  <greghaynes> No one, ever, uses linux. why?
2010-09-21T22:26:03  <jmcarthur> i don't think search applies as strongly this time
2010-09-21T22:26:11  <jmcarthur> because the search space is so huge
2010-09-21T22:26:15  <greghaynes> Defintely
2010-09-21T22:26:21  <greghaynes> Tron was all about search
2010-09-21T22:26:23  <jimmerton> I think the value functions will be important
2010-09-21T22:26:28  <jmcarthur> nonetheless, i am working with a search algorithm of my own
2010-09-21T22:26:38  <jimmerton> the value of a planet based on the planets around it
2010-09-21T22:26:47  <jimmerton> etc
2010-09-21T22:26:49  <greghaynes> You could definitely turn this into a search problem...
2010-09-21T22:27:10  <jmcarthur> yeah you just have to have insane pruning, or don't generate moves that you have to prune in the first place...
2010-09-21T22:27:48  <jmcarthur> it also looks a lot like some sort of linear programming problem to me, but i haven't determined how to go about that approach yet
2010-09-21T22:28:11  <jmcarthur> the rules are just ever so slightly more complicated than i think straight up linear programming can tackle
2010-09-21T22:28:20  <jmcarthur> but maybe some generalization...
2010-09-21T22:28:35  <jmcarthur> might be too computationally expensive if it even exists
2010-09-21T22:29:11  <jmcarthur> and finding it would probably be thesis-worthy
2010-09-21T22:30:01  <sigh> I've been trying to nut out some solid maths for this, but failing other than in very simple situations
2010-09-21T22:30:26  <jmcarthur> my attempts to micro-optimize my simulation code has proven to be surprisingly fruitful in this area
2010-09-21T22:30:33  <jmcarthur> of understanding the game on a more mathematical level, i mean
2010-09-21T22:30:57  <sigh> hmmm... any hints? ;)
2010-09-21T22:31:16  <jmcarthur> that *was* a hint :P

2010-09-21T22:35:28  <jmcarthur> using this purely functional multidimensional array library has really made me think about the problem differently. i didn't quite expect that
2010-09-21T22:36:08  <sigh> thinking about anything in a purely functional way makes you think about the problem differently
2010-09-21T22:36:35  <jmcarthur> well yeah, but i have been using haskell as my primary language for 3+ years now
2010-09-21T22:36:43  <sigh> :)

2010-09-21T22:38:20  <jmcarthur> i like how it emphasizes cache coherency by offering functions that pretty much exclusively operate on the "inner" dimensions of the arrays
2010-09-21T22:38:56  <sigh> hmmm... hadn't thought of it that way
2010-09-21T22:39:05  <sigh> interesting
2010-09-21T22:39:13  <jmcarthur> and to work on out dimensions you have to transpose the array, which is actually a free operation because it only changes the indexing function, but having to do that explicitly forces you to consider the cache effects you are about to inflict
2010-09-21T22:39:17  <jmcarthur> *on outer
2010-09-21T22:40:17  <jmcarthur> and then finally you can balance it all out with a force function that rewrites the array into a cache coherent form for the current index transformation

2010-09-21T22:47:14  <antiUni> i'm using c++, you can use haskell though
2010-09-21T22:47:18  <antiUni> i believe jmcarthur is

2010-09-21T22:49:40  <jmcarthur> yeah there are a few using haskell
2010-09-21T22:49:48  <jmcarthur> the server currently has a super crappy version of ghc though
2010-09-21T22:50:11  <sigh> jmcarthur: how goes your campaign for binaries?
2010-09-21T22:50:37  <jmcarthur> sigh: no objections on the mailing list. i think it will go through. i just have to convince an admin to actually take the steps to allow it
2010-09-21T22:50:45  <sigh> cool
2010-09-21T22:50:56  <jmcarthur> sigh: i had written a patch for it ages ago. just needs to be merged in and an entry added to the db
2010-09-21T22:51:57  <sigh> jmcarthur: what is your role in this comp, you seem quite involved, but you aren't an admin?
2010-09-21T22:52:11  <jmcarthur> no i'm just a contributor
2010-09-21T22:52:18  <jmcarthur> the project being open source means it's easy to help out :)
2010-09-21T22:52:23  <sigh> ah, i see... keep up the good work :)
2010-09-21T22:53:04  <jmcarthur> pretty much the only people who are disqualified from entering are the maintainers (those who have access to the machines running the bots and stuff)
2010-09-21T22:53:17  <sigh> yeah, that's fair
2010-09-21T22:53:38  <jmcarthur> some of the maintainers are actually people who were originally going to compete but sacrificed that to assist with the technicals
2010-09-21T22:53:48  <jmcarthur> i do not envy them, but i am very grateful
2010-09-21T22:53:53  <sigh> :)
2010-09-21T22:54:24  <jimmerton> I think it's a great competition
2010-09-21T22:54:34  <sigh> me too
2010-09-21T22:54:41  <jimmerton> I'm trying to get more of my friends involved

2010-09-21T22:56:55  <sigh> McLeopold beats everyone :P
2010-09-21T22:57:02  <jmcarthur> he didn't think he would beat Arekku
2010-09-21T22:57:21  <sigh> why Arekku specifically?
2010-09-21T22:57:55  <jmcarthur> watch some of Arekku's games
