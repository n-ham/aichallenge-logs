2011-11-13T00:00:56  <janzert> well you know at least 1 player per game ahead of you will be used of course so can set the min to that

2011-11-13T00:04:07  <amstan> smooth is usually the opposite of noise
2011-11-13T00:04:27  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yeah, I was in that range before I resubmitted.
2011-11-13T00:04:59  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: my prior version was in position 21ish and I resubmitted a slightly better bot and in the meantime the same score has slipped down to mid-30s
2011-11-13T00:05:04  <Extrarius> yeah, but I added the noise before smoothing to give more 'character' - the noise by itsel is really ugly, but the smoothed version without noise looks kinda boring imo (and makes the circular worm shape obvious)
2011-11-13T00:05:10  <ChrisH_> the has been a lot of good competition climbing the ladder this past week.
2011-11-13T00:05:47  <BenJackson> I've been wondering if I should revisit the pre-hill game and "solve" that myself to gain some insight into how the top players are thinking
2011-11-13T00:05:58  <BenJackson> since hills seems to be a distraction that's slowing everyone else down!
2011-11-13T00:06:04  <ChrisH_> My new bot is a lot better than my old one, but it has time management issues that I need to work out.
2011-11-13T00:06:33  <BenJackson> my new bot crushes my old bot reliably but I think that's only going to be worth a couple of skill points and get offset by others climbing the ladder
2011-11-13T00:07:07  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I think combat skills will be a big differentiator at the top of the charts
2011-11-13T00:07:22  <BenJackson> actually if I just let this one play the sigma reduction will probably gain me 10 spots
2011-11-13T00:07:42  <BenJackson> but who wants to come in 20th
2011-11-13T00:08:13  <ChrisH_> I was amazed that I stayed in the top 25 for as long as I did with basically no combat logic, just avoiding enemy ants until I was ready to attack a hill, then hope I could swarm it with numbers.
2011-11-13T00:08:35  <BenJackson> that was basically my first bot
2011-11-13T00:09:20  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: if you submitted early enough you could solidify a good mu and low sigma
2011-11-13T00:09:30  <BenJackson> I think people will be surprised at the shakeup in the final tournament
2011-11-13T00:09:34  <ChrisH_> Yeah, I was submission #10.  :)
2011-11-13T00:09:35  <BenJackson> just based on the weirdness I've seen
2011-11-13T00:10:21  <ChrisH_> But I would still win games against most bots #30 or higher, it was only the top few bots that I'd always lose to, until this week anyway.
2011-11-13T00:10:26  <janzert> ChrisH_: hehe, so with the current percentage of users in the queue for seeding all the complicated algorithm does is reduce to the simple players ahead / games per minute that I wanted to go to before anyway :P
2011-11-13T00:10:42  <Extrarius> in this kind of progressive tournament, mu and sigma should probably be increased once  a week or two to let old bots sink faster as new ones become better
2011-11-13T00:10:49  <BenJackson> I'm still interested in some meta-analysis
2011-11-13T00:10:57  <BenJackson> any idea how many positions are occupied by starter kits?
2011-11-13T00:11:25  <ChrisH_> janzert: wow, that's interesting, and funny too
2011-11-13T00:11:51  <janzert> oh well I'll probably put the complicated one in for now in case the percentage of activated bots ever increases significantly
2011-11-13T00:12:33  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I haven't tried to figure that out recently, but about 1.5 weeks ago I guessed it was around 30-40%.
2011-11-13T00:13:01  <BenJackson> while watching my last upload ascend I got really interested in what was going on at the mid levels
2011-11-13T00:13:14  <BenJackson> I stomped some 500-600 ranked bots and so I started exploring those games
2011-11-13T00:13:50  <BenJackson> it seemed strange to me somehow that you could write an algorithm that would be so consistent (plenty of those bots had low sigma) but also so... mediocre
2011-11-13T00:14:06  <amstan> janzert: so.. with 20GB are we going to be able to store all the submissions/replays?
2011-11-13T00:14:08  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I find it fascinating how bots with low sigmas and similar mu's tend to have very similar behaviors.
2011-11-13T00:14:13  <BenJackson> it made me think there must be some very common distinguishing features and big lumps of similar population
2011-11-13T00:14:21  * BenJackson hi5's
2011-11-13T00:14:42  <BenJackson> so I wanted to write a python script to analyze replays and try to figure out which ants have combat, hill seeking, etc
2011-11-13T00:14:50  <BenJackson> run it over a big sample of games
2011-11-13T00:15:01  <BenJackson> and then plot overlapping histograms of features vs rank
2011-11-13T00:15:09  <janzert> amstan: for the current contest, I believe so
2011-11-13T00:15:13  <ChrisH_> That would be an interesting data set to see.
2011-11-13T00:15:18  <amstan> BenJackson: i've read a bunch of post mortems which analyzed games from top bots
2011-11-13T00:18:50  <amstan> janzert: i'm going to try backing up and archiving /var/lib/mysql/contest from planetwars, and see how big it actually is
2011-11-13T00:19:07  <janzert> ok
2011-11-13T00:19:42  <ChrisH_> So, my most recent submission has added real combat logic, but when I was working on the code I was stunned that I found at least two bugs in my old bot's map graph update logic that made it sometimes forget about a water tile or have the wrong idea about whether a tile was within attack range of another. Yet my bot's overall behavior wasn't obviously affected by these bugs. Amazing that micro bugs like that can be masked for so
2011-11-13T00:20:37  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-11-13T00:20:54  <BenJackson> or in my case I know certain limitations of my "strategy" level code also work in my favor...sometimes
2011-11-13T00:21:18  <BenJackson> I've made those "better" (ie gotten more direct control) but then made a worse bot
2011-11-13T00:21:51  <ChrisH_> I experienced that towards the end of PlanetWars.

2011-11-13T00:24:11  <ChrisH_> I made lots of attempts to "improve" my bot in the last week or two before finals and none of them had a measurable impact or actually made things worse, so I ended up sticking with the bot that worked best even though it made some decisions based on guesses of what to do.

2011-11-13T00:29:04  <janzert> approximately 1000 activated
2011-11-13T00:29:17  <BenJackson> someone was pretty careful not to leak information about map symmetry to the bots
2011-11-13T00:29:22  <janzert> so somewhere around 1/6
2011-11-13T00:29:23  <BenJackson> I congratulate them... and curse them
2011-11-13T00:29:24  <ChrisH_> has that been staying pretty consistent?
2011-11-13T00:29:42  <janzert> it's actually gone down over the last few days
2011-11-13T00:29:47  <janzert> it was around 1200

2011-11-13T00:30:42  <janzert> don't think so :)
2011-11-13T00:30:53  <janzert> and they won't
2011-11-13T00:31:41  <ChrisH_> is the plan to incrementally raise the cuttoff point similar to what was done in the PW finals?
2011-11-13T00:31:48  <janzert> yep
2011-11-13T00:32:21  <ChrisH_> good, that seems to work well, although I wonder how trueskill will react
2011-11-13T00:32:44  <janzert> hmm, good question

2011-11-13T00:33:11  <BenJackson> btw if you don't get any other awards I was thinking of donating plaques or something.  I have a laser cutter
2011-11-13T00:33:57  <ChrisH_> it would seem that bots that just make it into the cuttoff will be penalized the most, and that the avg mu would probably fall for all bots in the cutoff once enough games are played.
2011-11-13T00:33:59  <janzert> ooh that'd be cool, although getting them to winners might be a challenge in itself :(
2011-11-13T00:34:55  <janzert> ChrisH_: the planetwars cutoff was soft in that if a bot fell below the cutoff the bot coming above would then play instead
2011-11-13T00:35:11  <ChrisH_> janzert: interesting, i didn't realize that
2011-11-13T00:35:23  <ChrisH_> so it was more dynamic
2011-11-13T00:35:28  <BenJackson> wait, wouldn't that mean that the lowest not-cut-off bot would sub for every cut-off bot?
2011-11-13T00:35:47  <janzert> ChrisH_: yeah
2011-11-13T00:36:01  <ChrisH_> that should keep the mu's more in line with expectations then
2011-11-13T00:36:14  <ChrisH_> but that area just below the cuttoff is going to get compressed
2011-11-13T00:36:33  <ChrisH_> but not a bad solution I don't think
2011-11-13T00:36:34  <janzert> BenJackson: how ever many bots got pushed below the cutoff would be replaced by the bots previously just below, yes
2011-11-13T00:36:47  <BenJackson> oic
2011-11-13T00:37:06  <BenJackson> so the cutoff doesn't change the population or the mu or the sigma
2011-11-13T00:37:10  <ChrisH_> I think that works out, at least just intuiting about it.
2011-11-13T00:37:11  <BenJackson> it just changes who gets to play
2011-11-13T00:37:16  <janzert> right
2011-11-13T00:37:57  <ChrisH_> the important thing is that the rankings stay accurate, and i think that is preserved well by the soft cuttoff idea
2011-11-13T00:38:37  <BenJackson> ChrisH_ actually I think the compression goes the other way
2011-11-13T00:38:42  <janzert> I am a bit more worried about it with trueskill than I was will bayeselo
2011-11-13T00:38:44  <ChrisH_> how so?
2011-11-13T00:38:51  <BenJackson> the above-cutoff players will have continually decreasing sigma
2011-11-13T00:39:09  <BenJackson> that will tend to create a gap in "skill" just above the cutoff

2011-11-13T00:40:13  <ChrisH_> maybe, but a bot that just wins all the time doesn't seem to lose as much sigma as one that wins 50%, so the bots at the bottom of the cuttoff beating up on the bots just below it has less impact on the sigmas in general, but you could be right
2011-11-13T00:40:45  <janzert> the behavior I expected and seemed to see was that players around the cutoff tended to bounce back and forth around it
2011-11-13T00:41:01  <ChrisH_> yes, that is what I would expect
2011-11-13T00:41:04  <BenJackson> eg if you stop when sigma=~3 for everyone and implement a cutoff S, when you play the upper bots until sigma=~2 then bots who were at score S will now be at ~S+3 while bots below S will still be at S
2011-11-13T00:41:14  <ChrisH_> a rotating band of cannon fodder
2011-11-13T00:41:21  <janzert> yep :)
2011-11-13T00:41:49  <BenJackson> maybe that is offset by dropping mu due to the competition suddenly becoming entirely one-sided
2011-11-13T00:42:15  <BenJackson> so the Sth place bot suddenly loses "all" of its games
2011-11-13T00:42:20  <ChrisH_> there should be a group of bots with sigma ~2.5 just above and below the cuttoff at that point
2011-11-13T00:42:29  <janzert> BenJackson: if it was a hard cutoff that would be more likely perhaps

2011-11-13T00:42:50  <ChrisH_> because they play fewer games due to bouncing above and below the cuttoff
2011-11-13T00:42:58  <Zaphus> anyone know how "players ahead of you" works on the main server ?   it should just be the people who are next in the queue to play... so why has mine gone from 5 ahead 10 minutes ago, to 11 ahead now - do some bots get to jump to the front of the queue somehow ?  or is it a reporting error
2011-11-13T00:43:48  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: with N player games there may be multiple bots at the same queue position that get counted in different orders (i'm guessing)
2011-11-13T00:44:17  <BenJackson> is there any goal behind how many players are pulled into a game?
2011-11-13T00:44:22  <BenJackson> or is it just randmo
2011-11-13T00:44:32  <janzert> Zaphus: three things, new players start at the front, players that reactivate are quite likely to be at or near the front, it seems the players that were in the same game as you last time tend to get randomly sorted ahead and behind
2011-11-13T00:45:03  <Zaphus> ah, ok, the list is unsorted...  that could be it... still not good when you're desperately waiting for that game that has taken 6 hours to arrive :-)
2011-11-13T00:45:18  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: I feel your pain.  ;)
2011-11-13T00:45:34  <BenJackson> I keep considering deactivating just to "save up" so my next submission will play quickly
2011-11-13T00:45:38  <janzert> BenJackson: basically the server tries to play all maps roughly the same amount
2011-11-13T00:45:46  <BenJackson> of course it will play bots ranked 2000th so it isn't that exciting anyway
2011-11-13T00:46:00  <ChrisH_> Although I think it's worse when you get the "now playing in a game" message and you are anxiously waiting for the results to be ready.  ;)
2011-11-13T00:46:07  <BenJackson> janzert: aha, I hadn't considered it from the map perspective
2011-11-13T00:46:48  <BenJackson> is it mathematically problematical to give some of a bot's mu back on resubmit?
2011-11-13T00:47:05  <Zaphus> damn, finally got the game and lost (2 players)... now to wait another 6 hours

2011-11-13T00:47:42  <janzert> I'd worry a bit about what it would do to trueskill but even if that worked out ok I'd rather not do it
2011-11-13T00:47:58  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: When I made my new submission a couple nights ago my bot was deactivated and the counter was getting close to 0, so I was trying to get my code uploaded before I got pulled into a game, but alas, after I hit submit I got the "no playing in a game" message, *for my old bot* and had to wait six hours for my new code's first game.
2011-11-13T00:48:24  <a1k0n> amstan: awesome
2011-11-13T00:48:25  <BenJackson> that happened to me for my V5 submission
2011-11-13T00:48:44  <Zaphus> yeah, but I have problems with them, it's always the same bots I keep playing, no variety (especially on tcpants.com which plays 2 player games, so you play the same person 20 times in a row!)
2011-11-13T00:49:04  <BenJackson> ChrisH_ by the time you're ready to deactivate your sigma is low enough you've become a useful reference bot
2011-11-13T00:49:29  <BenJackson> Zaphus: more specifically you play *me* 20 times in a row
2011-11-13T00:49:37  <Zaphus> yep
2011-11-13T00:49:38  <BenJackson> I'm not sure why it's not mixing things up more
2011-11-13T00:49:45  <BenJackson> fluxid.pl has people too
2011-11-13T00:49:47  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yes, and since my old submission was one of the oldest still around it was still getting 8 games a day while deactivated
2011-11-13T00:49:59  <BenJackson> and that 213* server which I keep a bot on but seems hit or mis
2011-11-13T00:50:09  <janzert> the pairing spreads out the games so much now that whatever your sigma if you're in the top few hundred you're going to pretty much get games no matter what
2011-11-13T00:51:14  <BenJackson> ah, hence the comment about how resubmits are even slower than "normal" game rate
2011-11-13T00:51:58  <thestinger> the tcp server doesn't seem to bother waiting long for matchmaking so the bots play the same opponents as their last game most of the time

2011-11-13T01:00:19  <a1k0n> if you click some of the games on the profile page you linked me the first few work but the last few don't
2011-11-13T01:00:33  <amstan> hmmm

2011-11-13T01:02:16  <amstan> the last leaderboard_id is from 2010-03-01 15:02:41
2011-11-13T01:02:51  <amstan> game id 3878644 exists
2011-11-13T01:02:51  <janzert> that sounds like when submissions closed
2011-11-13T01:03:04  <amstan> might be a maps problem again
2011-11-13T01:03:14  <janzert> I don't really remember how long finals ran though
2011-11-13T01:03:23  <BenJackson> a1k0n: do you have the maps?
2011-11-13T01:04:16  <amstan> janzert: that was a monday, contest closed on a friday night
2011-11-13T01:04:21  <amstan> so i think that was right
2011-11-13T01:04:29  <BenJackson> thestinger: that assault on the red clot went better than I expected
2011-11-13T01:04:34  <amstan> anyway
2011-11-13T01:04:39  <amstan> data does exist, so it's fine
2011-11-13T01:04:43  <amstan> going to bed, fixing later
2011-11-13T01:04:59  <amstan> a1k0n: just link anyway, i'll look at fixing it
2011-11-13T01:05:05  <a1k0n> this was one of the starter pack maps iirc
2011-11-13T01:05:12  <a1k0n> not one of the final game maps
2011-11-13T01:05:25  <janzert> hmm, yeah I guess I made the last commit to my bot on 2-26
2011-11-13T01:05:30  <a1k0n> updated the links on my blog; thanks

2011-11-13T01:38:12  <janzert> no wonder number of players ahead bounces around so much, just noticed that it's including players currently in games
2011-11-13T01:38:45  <a1k0n> i occasionally see negative estimates for when my next game will be
2011-11-13T01:38:56  <janzert> you shouldn't anymore ;)
2011-11-13T01:39:03  <a1k0n> you must be doing some kind of average game rate + N*stddev minutes
2011-11-13T01:39:06  <janzert> as of those last two commits
2011-11-13T01:39:26  <janzert> not quite
2011-11-13T01:39:46  <janzert> it is trying to take into account how long the current games have been going for
2011-11-13T01:39:54  <a1k0n> ahh
2011-11-13T01:40:23  <a1k0n> well you could do that, to get a more conservative estimate
2011-11-13T01:40:25  <janzert> I personally think it's rather misguided to try and get that accuracy where there is so much noise in the signal
2011-11-13T01:40:54  <a1k0n> certainly; it would just kinda smooth it out.  "your next game will be within <x> minutes" will be more confidently true.
2011-11-13T01:41:01  <a1k0n> but maybe.. not as informative.
2011-11-13T01:41:11  <a1k0n> "your next game will definitely be within 239848932 minutes"
2011-11-13T01:41:18  <janzert> :)
2011-11-13T01:42:13  <janzert> it was averaging estimates based on players ahead of you with the number of players per minute and the number of games per minute which is just completely inaccurate
2011-11-13T01:42:19  <a1k0n> might want to.. expand into hours:minutes too btw
2011-11-13T01:42:20  <janzert> the new method should be much better

2011-11-13T10:13:54  <bugnuts> sounds odd.
2011-11-13T10:14:40  <liberforce> i also noticed that someone if for example I timeout at turn 50, I only got stderr up to turn 40
2011-11-13T10:14:57  <liberforce> reducing the amout of logs sent improved that
2011-11-13T10:15:21  <liberforce> but then I have few traces to analyze, which makes them useless
2011-11-13T10:15:52  <liberforce> i tried again with gettimeofday, and I at last had a time > turntime which explains the timeout
2011-11-13T10:16:04  <liberforce> i'm trying to reproduce the behaviour
2011-11-13T10:17:48  <liberforce> I've got a new trace
2011-11-13T10:18:19  <liberforce> after the "go" was sent on stdout and flushed: 1912 microseconds

2011-11-13T10:18:42  <liberforce> the game tells me I timed out at the same turn
2011-11-13T10:19:00  <liberforce> no, micro, gettimeofday has microseconds precision
2011-11-13T10:19:38  <liberforce> which means I timed out with time < 2ms and turntime = 200ms

2011-11-13T11:11:01  <cuademon> How about the frontpage
2011-11-13T11:11:32  <etaonis> It says 'Fall 2011' - does that mean it ends when winter starts?!
2011-11-13T11:12:09  <cuademon> The current phase of the contest will end December 18th at 11:59pm EST. At that time submissions will be closed. Shortly thereafter the final tournament will be started. The length of the final tournament has not yet been determined but is expected to last less than one week. Upon completion the contest winner will be announced and all results will be publically available.
2011-11-13T11:12:10  <etaonis> Oh, sorry

2011-11-13T11:48:14  <Conorach> does it?
2011-11-13T11:48:25  <Conorach> ah yes doesn't work on server or something
2011-11-13T11:48:27  <Conorach> I had that too.
2011-11-13T11:48:54  <Conorach> have to include #include <sys/time.h>  just under #else //Mac/Linux timr
2011-11-13T11:49:05  <Conorach> at least, that worked for me.
2011-11-13T11:49:19  <Conorach> or is there something else wrong liberforce?

2011-11-13T13:05:25  <bmh> morning a1k0n -- I'm considering abandoning Haskell. Largely due to my inability to write performant haskell.
2011-11-13T13:05:43  <a1k0n> that was my reason for not using it.
2011-11-13T13:06:06  <bmh> I can run my cellular automata about 25 times before it times out. I'm sure it would run about a billion times per second in C
2011-11-13T13:06:57  <a1k0n> yeah, without mutable arrays thats a challenge
2011-11-13T13:07:16  <bmh> I'm *using* mutable arrays

2011-11-13T15:38:23  <amstan> yoR: the contest needs identical servers to be fair
2011-11-13T15:39:42  <mleise> yoR: that would mean, that your personal computer executes other contestants bots, and you could take a look at their code.
2011-11-13T15:40:01  <amstan> that too
2011-11-13T15:40:27  <yoR> There are smart people working on the contests, there are probably ways around both problems
2011-11-13T15:40:50  <amstan> yoR: also.. each game requires 12GB of ram
2011-11-13T15:40:57  <amstan> kinda hard to crowdsource that
2011-11-13T15:40:58  <yoR> For example the timelimit could be variable, before each game do a little benchmark and adjust the timelimit accordingly
2011-11-13T15:41:11  <yoR> That is true..
2011-11-13T15:41:31  <amstan> and there's not many ways around the admins seeing the source code
2011-11-13T15:42:44  <Anilm3> 12GB each game??
2011-11-13T15:42:50  <Anilm3> that can't be right
2011-11-13T15:43:33  <thestinger> why not? each bot gets up to 1GB of memory

2011-11-13T15:44:27  <BenJackson> even if there was a ton of swapping you could grind through a game with 10 players with 1 cpu and 1G

2011-11-13T15:44:41  <BenJackson> and you should get the same result as a run on another machine with the same cpu
2011-11-13T15:44:54  <amstan> BenJackson: cpu time on 1GHz cpu doesn't give you the same ammount of instructions on a 100MHz cpu

2011-11-13T16:38:44  <Cowbandit> ah
2011-11-13T16:38:49  <BenJackson> so you really don't have to optimize for that unless your whole bot is stuck in some middle tier where peopel are doing that
2011-11-13T16:38:59  <BenJackson> because top bots won't do that to you because they don't want to lose
2011-11-13T16:39:09  <Cowbandit> oh ok i see
2011-11-13T16:39:29  <BenJackson> generally bots that do that don't know combat so your combat may be able to neutralize them even with just a few ants
2011-11-13T16:40:00  <Cowbandit> well i noticed some good players on the tcp server do that
2011-11-13T16:40:34  <Cowbandit> but w/e
2011-11-13T16:40:51  <Cowbandit> yeah nvm ur right they all seem to die afterwards
2011-11-13T16:41:03  <Cowbandit> hey i was also wondering
2011-11-13T16:41:07  <Cowbandit> for tactics
2011-11-13T16:41:17  <Cowbandit> how exactly would you anticipate moves ahead?

2011-11-13T16:43:26  <thestinger> ah, the tcp server doesn't really try matchmaking at all, the client just tries waiting for a random interval between 1 and 6 seconds
2011-11-13T16:43:41  <amstan> janzert: so is there no way to get a list of workers when it's not in the workers table?
2011-11-13T16:43:50  <thestinger> I might try increasing that interval b/c my bots just end up playing the same opponents over and over
2011-11-13T16:44:28  <BenJackson> amstan: btw for those of us who would donate if/when donations are figured out:  any estimate of how much it costs per game (or per bot per game)?
2011-11-13T16:44:33  <amstan> thestinger: yeah.. matchmaking is limited to what opponents you have available to play
2011-11-13T16:45:08  <thestinger> I have 3 bots running on it, and they basically play a different subset of opponents :P
2011-11-13T16:45:08  <amstan> BenJackson: it'll be per hour of server time i think, but i'm not sure of the price, janzert does
2011-11-13T16:45:33  <BenJackson> [13:30] <janzert> nah, just the workers that normally cost about $0.16 are running $1.00+ for some reason at the moment which is higher than our normal cap
2011-11-13T16:45:52  <amstan> there you go

2011-11-13T16:45:54  <BenJackson> so if I estimated cpu time/game in hours and multiply by something between 0.16 and $1
2011-11-13T16:46:10  <amstan> you already have that in the stats page, gpm
2011-11-13T16:46:23  <BenJackson> 0.0 ;-)
2011-11-13T16:46:33  <avdg> BenJackson: you could estimate the number of workers
2011-11-13T16:46:58  <avdg> the cap stays the same
2011-11-13T16:47:02  <amstan> BenJackson: lol.. umm
2011-11-13T16:47:06  <BenJackson> so 1500 turns * worst case .5s/turn = 750s/game ~ 0.2h/game/bot or between 3.2c and 20c
2011-11-13T16:47:11  <amstan> i think it's 2000s if all bots used their full time
2011-11-13T16:47:15  <avdg> (unless the budget raised)
2011-11-13T16:47:21  <BenJackson> per bot per game
2011-11-13T16:47:30  <amstan> no.. in total
2011-11-13T16:47:49  <BenJackson> my C++ bot takes about 1/10th time so I'll figure that's similar to others, so something like 0.32c/bot/game to 2c/bot/game
2011-11-13T16:47:59  <amstan> then 200s
2011-11-13T16:48:05  <amstan> so 0.3 gpm
2011-11-13T16:48:49  <BenJackson> so it's really more expensive than I thought
2011-11-13T16:48:54  <BenJackson> $100 is on the order of 1000 games
2011-11-13T16:49:13  <BenJackson> (not taking your average game length comments into account yet)

2011-11-13T19:35:48  <NightExcessive> Ah.
2011-11-13T19:36:11  <NightExcessive> So just iterating away from the specified point equally on all sides until a point with the desired conditions are met is best?
2011-11-13T19:36:19  <amstan> there we go, now it works
2011-11-13T19:36:34  <grwip> but simple bfs would work, you expand each path until you hit an explored tile and you return the path
2011-11-13T19:36:46  <grwip> NightExcessive: so yes

2011-11-13T19:37:58  <grwip> NightExcessive: but you can't really do that for each ant it will take too much time
2011-11-13T19:38:30  <grwip> NightExcessive: What I tried to do is just run this search for ants that have an unexplored Tile within their view radius
2011-11-13T19:40:03  <NightExcessive> Well, the way my exploration checks work is fairly simple: Once an ant sees a tile, it's marked explored. Even if it goes out of view range from all ants, it still has the exploration mark. It's basically so that my ants will explore the entire map and find other hills (and food).

2011-11-13T19:50:52  <bmh> so that I can run collaborative diffusion on places I've never seen
2011-11-13T19:50:59  <bmh> and generate food in areas that my ants can't see
2011-11-13T19:51:15  <amstan> unless you're hacking our servers or submitting bots that are good in general but loose intentionally to your bot to get higher in ranks, everything is fair game
2011-11-13T19:51:23  <amstan> including using bots from past competitions
2011-11-13T19:51:37  <NightExcessive> amstan: Gotcha. But outgoing TCP connections are blocked?
2011-11-13T19:52:07  <amstan> yes
2011-11-13T19:52:18  <amstan> but in terms of using TCP for training your bot, or using replays
2011-11-13T19:52:22  <Carneque> Okay, to me and my weak AI skills I see this line as the area I need to expand upon:  a.IssueOrder(antLoc, d)
2011-11-13T19:52:24  <amstan> go right ahead, that's what you should be doing
2011-11-13T19:52:26  <bmh> yeah… if we could dial out I would phone up a cluster and brute for the solution :)
2011-11-13T19:52:28  <Anilm3> bmh: do you have a working version of collaborative diffusion?
2011-11-13T19:52:46  <bmh> Anilm3: the diffusion bit works, but my ants aren't following the gradient.
2011-11-13T19:52:58  <grwip> amstan: I was wondering something regarding the rules, is it allowed to upload several bots on the server before the competition starts but just left one for the competition?
2011-11-13T19:53:13  <amstan> grwip: no, please don't do that
2011-11-13T19:53:18  <Anilm3> bmh: I tried something similar before knowing it existed and had the same problem
2011-11-13T19:53:30  <amstan> grwip: you're just stealing from other people's worker time
2011-11-13T19:53:44  <NightExcessive> Hum. So you have to get your bots to "learn" offline, then embed the data in them before uploading?
2011-11-13T19:53:53  <amstan> NightExcessive: sure
2011-11-13T19:53:57  <bmh> Anilm3: I've printed out the board state and it looks fine. I'm just doing something excessively dull
2011-11-13T19:54:03  <NightExcessive> Awesome. More challenge! :)
2011-11-13T19:54:13  <Anilm3> NightExcessive: you can use the tcp client for that
2011-11-13T19:54:20  <amstan> NightExcessive: tip: TCP games are a little different than official games, you might want to look at using official replays only
2011-11-13T19:54:26  <grwip> amstan: I understand and wasn't really going to do that, was just curious about this point which is not really clear in the rules... but I guess it's common sense
2011-11-13T19:54:52  <amstan> grwip: it's about 1. worker cpu usage, 2. inflating rankings
2011-11-13T19:54:56  <NightExcessive> amstan: I was referring to TCP to connect from a running instance inside a worker to a server of my own and relay the current state (from my state manage).
2011-11-13T19:55:07  <Anilm3> bmh: I thought the idea would make my ants follow each other like the really cool bots, but instead they went mad :(

2011-11-13T19:55:34  <analyst74> NightExcessive, you cannot do that, as amstan said, but you can download official replay for learning purpose
2011-11-13T19:55:34  <grwip> amstan: loud and clear :)
2011-11-13T19:56:49  <NightExcessive> amstan: Basically send data to my own servers for learning, then at the beginning of a round the bot would connect to pull learning data. Would basically save me from having to embed the data and re-upload... but I'm fine following the rules. :)
2011-11-13T19:56:57  <NightExcessive> Not a round, a match.
2011-11-13T19:57:46  <bmh> NightExcessive: just train on fluxid and embed when you're ready

2011-11-13T19:58:31  <NightExcessive> Alrighty.
2011-11-13T19:58:52  <amstan> NightExcessive: what would be awesome though, is allow people to write to their folders and learn on the fly
2011-11-13T19:59:24  <NightExcessive> amstan: I agree. My local learning file has only been through 4 games and is already 40 some odd MB, though. :x
2011-11-13T19:59:45  <amstan> that's rather high, lol
2011-11-13T20:00:00  <bmh> do some SVD on that shit ;)

2011-11-13T20:00:10  <bmh> amstan: Will you be running the competition next year?
2011-11-13T20:00:14  <Antimony> singular value decomp?
2011-11-13T20:00:14  <NightExcessive> Yeahh. Probably because I haven't bothered with compression or getting rid of the unneeded state data.
2011-11-13T20:00:16  <amstan> bmh: probably
2011-11-13T20:00:16  <bmh> singular value decomposition
2011-11-13T20:00:25  <amstan> bmh: see the zeta branch
2011-11-13T20:00:32  <amstan> but we still need a game
2011-11-13T20:02:02  <NightExcessive> Has any tried using flow fields?
2011-11-13T20:03:01  <Anilm3> I certainly have not
2011-11-13T20:03:49  <NightExcessive> I tried it with a Lua bot but it was too computationally intensive with any number of ants higher than 15.
2011-11-13T20:04:15  <bmh> NightExcessive: is flow fields = collaborative diffusion, then yes
2011-11-13T20:04:22  <Anilm3> and with that 15 ants did it work?
2011-11-13T20:04:33  <NightExcessive> It worked extremely well.
2011-11-13T20:04:55  <NightExcessive> bmh: Kind of like collaborative diffusion.

2011-11-13T20:38:37  <amstan> how about changing the /etc/hosts file from the new server to resolve ai-contest.com to the old server
2011-11-13T20:38:42  <amstan> and setting up an apache proxy
2011-11-13T20:39:10  <amstan> is there anything relying to ai-contest.com on the server?

2011-11-13T20:41:01  <amstan> so it might go down by 50%
2011-11-13T20:42:19  <janzert> so worst case 60GB should work for an archive server?
2011-11-13T20:42:31  <janzert> for the moment
2011-11-13T20:42:33  <amstan> yes

2011-11-13T20:57:42  <NightExcessive> Carneque: That happens to me with Chrome + HTML5 whenever my bot errors
2011-11-13T20:57:56  <Anilm3> But isn't the engine written in python?
2011-11-13T20:58:11  <NightExcessive> The replayer seems to use Java sometimes (IE only?)
2011-11-13T20:58:17  <Carneque> It's happening to me across all browsers
2011-11-13T20:58:18  <NightExcessive> I know it did when I accidentally clicked a link in VS2010.
2011-11-13T20:58:35  <amstan> woot! http://planetwars.aichallenge.org/

2011-11-13T20:59:31  <amstan> hmm.. maybe it could
2011-11-13T20:59:39  <amstan> thing is.. i made a copy of it for this

2011-11-13T20:59:49  <amstan> and i don't want to not do that incase the pack goes wrong
2011-11-13T20:59:53  <amstan> avdg: tell me about it, lol
2011-11-13T21:00:09  <janzert> yeah, having a copy would be good :)
2011-11-13T21:00:25  <Carneque> When I run .\MyBot.exe from cli it also just seems to time out
2011-11-13T21:00:40  <Carneque> This is the unmodified downloaded zip package
2011-11-13T21:00:51  <Carneque> I am doing something wrong thusly
2011-11-13T21:00:55  <avdg> Carneque: does it have input?
2011-11-13T21:01:11  <Carneque> Do you mean, have I given input to MyBot.exe
2011-11-13T21:01:24  <avdg> yeah
2011-11-13T21:01:31  <Carneque> I just executed command '.\MyBot.exe'
2011-11-13T21:01:42  <avdg> your bot is listening to stdin for data to process

2011-11-13T21:09:49  <janzert> du -h --max-depth=1 . IIRC
2011-11-13T21:10:24  <CowTipperVirus> @Carneque, edit the command (.bat in windows) to run your bot
2011-11-13T21:10:25  <contestbot> CowTipperVirus: I'm sorry Dave, err CowTipperVirus; I cannot 'Carneque,'.
2011-11-13T21:10:29  <CowTipperVirus> so mine for example would be:
2011-11-13T21:10:31  <NightExcessive> janzert: du -sh .
2011-11-13T21:10:51  <CowTipperVirus> bleh.. stupid bot, did you get that last message carneque?
2011-11-13T21:11:08  <pedrosorio> yes he did
2011-11-13T21:11:10  <pedrosorio> :P
2011-11-13T21:11:14  <amstan> janzert: this is going to take a while
2011-11-13T21:11:18  <thestinger> @rq
2011-11-13T21:11:19  <contestbot> thestinger: I have no idea what you mean.
2011-11-13T21:11:29  <Carneque> CTVirus, I don't have a clue what's going on
2011-11-13T21:11:32  <Carneque> Just like the contestbot
2011-11-13T21:11:46  <Carneque> the example would be:
2011-11-13T21:11:51  <Carneque> I'm not sure how to edit a .bat
2011-11-13T21:11:52  <janzert> NightExcessive: ahh, handy. I knew the gnu version had to have a shorter invocation
2011-11-13T21:11:57  <CowTipperVirus> ok... so my play_one_game.cmd has a bunch of stuff... at the very end, I added
2011-11-13T21:12:06  <NightExcessive> :)
2011-11-13T21:12:07  <CowTipperVirus> """%~dp0sample_bots\mine\MyBot.exe"""
2011-11-13T21:12:22  <janzert> bsd version had du -hd 1 .
2011-11-13T21:12:45  <CowTipperVirus> so under the sample bots directory, I put my bot... and I told the play_one_game batch file to pull my bot into its game
2011-11-13T21:12:49  <CowTipperVirus> should be all there is to it
2011-11-13T21:12:49  <janzert> although it's been quite I while since I've used it so may be misremembering now
2011-11-13T21:13:18  <Carneque> Yes this doesn't seem too complicated, I'm looking into creating a Bat file
2011-11-13T21:13:25  <Carneque> It looks like the bat file is just a set of commands
2011-11-13T21:13:50  <CowTipperVirus> correct, carneque, now just make it run your bot instead of calling sample bots only
2011-11-13T21:14:14  <Carneque> will do (try to do)

2011-11-13T21:16:31  <amstan> over where?
2011-11-13T21:16:41  <janzert> to the archive server
2011-11-13T21:16:57  <janzert> but I suppose you're trying to get space for the compression
2011-11-13T21:17:17  <amstan> is there a point to keeping them though? we can't do much with them
2011-11-13T21:17:24  <amstan> we can't release them to anyone except the owners
2011-11-13T21:17:25  <janzert> yeah, not really
2011-11-13T21:17:50  <amstan> they're only useful for people that want to debate the rankings
2011-11-13T21:18:01  <amstan> but then we should only be storing like top 50
2011-11-13T21:18:06  <janzert> the only reason I can think of is if we ever reopen old contests
2011-11-13T21:18:23  <janzert> that's come up a time or two but I'm not sure it's likely to really happen
2011-11-13T21:19:09  <Flapadar> If you're talking about the code
2011-11-13T21:19:22  <Carneque> THanks CTVirus, it worked
2011-11-13T21:19:24  <Flapadar> isn't it stored so as winners can release their winning entry if they wish
2011-11-13T21:19:41  <Flapadar> top 50 might
2011-11-13T21:19:45  <Flapadar> not matter*
2011-11-13T21:20:41  <janzert> Flapadar: we never publicly make available the code, the authors do it themselves
2011-11-13T21:21:41  * avdg waits until the day the server got hacked
2011-11-13T21:21:44  <avdg> just kidding :p
2011-11-13T21:22:16  <ALplus> so there isn't really way to query the amount of food left in the hives?
2011-11-13T21:22:25  <NightExcessive> janzert: Why not put the archives on S3?
2011-11-13T21:22:29  <Extrarius> janzert: It'd be cool if there was a way to have the contest site host code for those that want to share it - maybe some kind of checkbox when you submit your bot 'share this code after contest'?
2011-11-13T21:22:44  <avdg> ALplus: there should be
2011-11-13T21:22:45  <Flapadar> you can only see within the revealed FOW @ALPlus
2011-11-13T21:23:04  <avdg> as food can only be picked up after the round they are spawned
2011-11-13T21:23:12  <Flapadar> You can save positions of where food was but there's no guarantee it will be there later
2011-11-13T21:23:19  <CowTipperVirus> no.. no way to see how many ants you have in the hive
2011-11-13T21:23:29  <ALplus> thanks cowtipper
2011-11-13T21:23:36  <CowTipperVirus> you have to keep track (estimate is best you can do) of how much food you ate
2011-11-13T21:23:45  <ALplus> hm... interesting
2011-11-13T21:23:46  <CowTipperVirus> there's a forum post on it
2011-11-13T21:23:55  <janzert> NightExcessive: apparently no one has been able to create a static version of the old sites
2011-11-13T21:23:55  <Flapadar> You don't have to estimate how much you are
2011-11-13T21:23:56  <Flapadar> ate*
2011-11-13T21:23:59  <avdg> yeah, you can keep track of that number accurately
2011-11-13T21:24:13  <Flapadar> You can count how many ants you have on a per-frame basis and iterate it
2011-11-13T21:24:13  <ALplus> by seeing if the food list changes i assume?
2011-11-13T21:24:17  <CowTipperVirus> maybe you guys are better than me :) it's hard to keep track of accurately
2011-11-13T21:24:24  <amstan> NightExcessive: it's work, you need to modify the visualizer and all that
2011-11-13T21:24:39  <NightExcessive> Ah. What about for the old code and packed database?
2011-11-13T21:24:43  <avdg> well, if I can get it, I'm fighting for it in my codebase ;-)
2011-11-13T21:24:44  <Flapadar> or on the food list ofc :P
2011-11-13T21:25:55  <Flapadar> Speaking of the visualiser has anyone noticed it not load if the bot takes a longer time per turn?
2011-11-13T21:26:23  <Flapadar> mine loads a blank page if the bot takes >~0.3 seconds on a single turn
2011-11-13T21:26:39  <NightExcessive> Flapadar: When I was toying with Lua bots, if the script timed out or errored it would simply not load.
2011-11-13T21:27:01  <Flapadar> Strange. Mine is lua, doesn't time out or crash, but that happens
2011-11-13T21:27:12  <NightExcessive> It caused a JS error because the JSON had a newline in it for me.
2011-11-13T21:27:15  <Flapadar> I rewrote my astar specifically so as to reduce timeouts lol

2011-11-13T22:45:44  <janzert> just to test did you try it once with the db on the main drive?
2011-11-13T22:46:00  <amstan> janzert: yes
2011-11-13T22:46:04  <janzert> hmm
2011-11-13T22:46:18  <janzert> weird
2011-11-13T22:46:40  <janzert> both are ext4 file systems mounted the same way
2011-11-13T22:47:13  <amstan> hmm
2011-11-13T22:47:18  <amstan> might be a permission error, hold on
2011-11-13T22:48:32  <amstan> nope.. this should work already
2011-11-13T22:49:31  <amstan> i'm getting a bunch of these: http://pastebin.com/pjHU4Awy
2011-11-13T22:50:17  <amstan> sigh.. everything is mysql:mysql and at least a 6 in the user permission
2011-11-13T22:50:41  <Zao> If you're running Fedora, watch out for additional selinux labelling.
2011-11-13T22:53:10  <amstan> Zao: it's not installed
2011-11-13T22:54:31  <janzert> possible mysql isn't getting run as the mysql user?

2011-11-13T22:54:46  <amstan> janzert: if i move the stuff back, it'll work
2011-11-13T22:54:51  <amstan> the only diff is the file location
2011-11-13T22:54:57  <amstan> i disabled/uninstalled apparmor
2011-11-13T22:55:00  <NightExcessive> Make sure the directories have +x (executable) permissions
2011-11-13T22:55:00  <amstan> let's see now
2011-11-13T22:55:08  <NightExcessive> Otherwise MySQL can't enumerate them
2011-11-13T22:55:20  <amstan> NightExcessive: yep, but only for user
2011-11-13T22:55:27  <amstan> that's what it was before i copied it
2011-11-13T22:55:31  <NightExcessive> Ah
2011-11-13T22:57:14  <NightExcessive> amstan: Is the C++ starter package licensed?
2011-11-13T22:57:31  <amstan> NightExcessive: everything is apache or something like that
2011-11-13T22:58:12  <NightExcessive> amstan: Ah. I'm refactoring a lot of it to be more object-oriented and more of my style... was considering redistributing it.
2011-11-13T22:58:22  <NightExcessive> I also added a shiney A* class :)

2011-11-13T22:59:07  <amstan> the starter package that is
2011-11-13T22:59:47  <NightExcessive> There's no attribution with it to start... so what attribution do I include? :v
2011-11-13T22:59:52  <janzert> amstan: should it be pointing at /media/archive/mysql or /media/archive/mysql/mysql?
2011-11-13T23:00:11  <amstan> first one
2011-11-13T23:00:25  <amstan> i did mv /var/lib/mysql /media/archive
2011-11-13T23:00:51  <amstan> running mysql_safe doesn't seem to do much
2011-11-13T23:01:06  <janzert> also I see an email message in response to a similar error about moving ib_logfile* out of the way when moving between servers
2011-11-13T23:03:31  <amstan> janzert: same thing
2011-11-13T23:05:25  <amstan> i really don't get this, i'm doing exactly the same thing with the ln -s on hypetriangle

2011-11-13T23:10:50  <janzert> yeah, I'm pretty much stumped
2011-11-13T23:14:00  <janzert> maybe try moving it back once and running mysql without changing the configuration
2011-11-13T23:14:30  <janzert> to try and double check that it is really picking up the configuration change
2011-11-13T23:15:25  <amstan> mysql start/running, process 10413
2011-11-13T23:15:28  <janzert> wish the error message included an absolute path
2011-11-13T23:16:38  <janzert> but it looks like my.cnf is pointing at /var/lib right now
2011-11-13T23:16:54  <janzert> try point my.cnf at /media/archive/mysql without actually moving the data
2011-11-13T23:16:57  <amstan> oh
2011-11-13T23:16:57  <janzert> make sure it breaks
2011-11-13T23:17:47  <amstan> well.. not even stop works now
2011-11-13T23:18:01  <amstan> but there's no process running
2011-11-13T23:18:54  <NightExcessive> amstan: Try using strace to see where it's looking
2011-11-13T23:19:56  <amstan> how do you pipe stderr to stdout again?
2011-11-13T23:20:39  <amstan> & not $ , *facepalm*

2011-11-13T23:21:32  <amstan> it still seems to request /var/lib/mysql/mysql/bin/mysqld
2011-11-13T23:21:43  <amstan> but like it doesn't exist
2011-11-13T23:22:52  <janzert> that's a weird path
2011-11-13T23:24:00  <amstan> ok, i give up
2011-11-13T23:24:02  <amstan> tomorrow!
2011-11-13T23:25:31  <bmh> chin up, amstan!
2011-11-13T23:26:03  <NightExcessive> bmh: I wish you had never given me the idea of collaborative diffusion. I'm gonna stay up way too late tonight. :P
2011-11-13T23:27:06  <bmh> NightExcessive: I've been faffing around with it in haskell for too long
2011-11-13T23:27:52  <NightExcessive> bmh: I'm trying it in C++. I can't get a nice spread from "scent" sources (I'm calling them positive and negative scents, as if the ants are lead completely by their noses. Which makes the food cakes.)
2011-11-13T23:28:46  <bmh> NightExcessive: The function I'm using for the food scent is just: score = max score, (maxNeighborScore - 1);
2011-11-13T23:29:08  <NightExcessive> I'm trying to get a non-linear diffusion.
2011-11-13T23:30:18  <bmh> why bother? I'm diffusing different scents on the same grid. I can combine them in a non-linear way when I evaluate each square
2011-11-13T23:31:26  <NightExcessive> True.
2011-11-13T23:31:43  <NightExcessive> I'm calculating mine when a function is called and spreading it inside that function to adjacent squares.
2011-11-13T23:33:15  <bmh> ah, I just evaluate the whole grid 40-or-so times

2011-11-13T23:49:21  <amstan> janzert: oh.. yeah.. have you tried worker_ssh?
2011-11-13T23:50:40  <janzert> not directly, the list on su contest was handy though
2011-11-13T23:51:05  <amstan> bashrc just does worker_ssh -l as in list
2011-11-13T23:51:15  <amstan> you can refresh that list with -r(which is also done in a cronjob)
2011-11-13T23:51:21  <janzert> right
2011-11-13T23:51:29  <amstan> if you give it a number or an ip as an argument, it'll ssh to it
2011-11-13T23:51:37  <amstan> -a sshs to all of them, sequencially
2011-11-13T23:51:38  <janzert> nice
2011-11-13T23:52:36  <amstan> i had it find if they were alive using pings before, problem was that the workers weren't answering to pings
2011-11-13T23:52:55  <amstan> so now i test that by oppening a connection to port 22 and failing if connection is refused or something
2011-11-13T23:54:31  <amstan> oh man.. this guy: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=1876
2011-11-13T23:54:34  <janzert> hmm, actually I think the problem is the server can ping out
2011-11-13T23:55:04  <janzert> yeah, I was looking at the pull request earlier
2011-11-13T23:55:18  <amstan> right.. so that guy..
2011-11-13T23:55:23  <amstan> he's like the starter package guy
2011-11-13T23:55:29  <bmh> ha
2011-11-13T23:55:35  <janzert> the big thing is that as given we have to trust his dart build
2011-11-13T23:55:37  <amstan> in tron he made both javascript and go starter package
2011-11-13T23:55:41  <amstan> now he made dart
2011-11-13T23:55:47  <amstan> janzert: he's from google, so i think it's fine
2011-11-13T23:56:10  <amstan> he might even be a dart dev
2011-11-13T23:59:06  <amstan> we could tell him to give us instructions on how to compile from source
