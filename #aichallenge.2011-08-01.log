2011-08-01T03:17:54  <mleise> Hey I'm on 64-bit now and I found out in the process that nVidia cards support hardware accelerated decoding of h264 flash video on YouTube (and anywhere else). It looks like that shaved off a BIG deal of my CPU load when browsing Youtube, especiall when I load some playlist to listen to music and do other things without actually watching the videos.
2011-08-01T03:21:51  <mleise> On a different note there is currently a discussion about the possibility of a language parser builder in the standard library in D. One that is fed with definitions like: 'if' is followed by '(' an expression, a ')' and a 'code block'.
2011-08-01T03:25:23  <mleise> I like these ideas, because you can write your programs in a very clean way then. Instead of lots of string tokenizing, ifs, switches recursion and the like you just put down the definition of a language you want to parse. You most probably lose some performance compared to a hand-written parser, but on the other hand debugging a 'definition' should be much easier.
2011-08-01T03:25:54  <mcstar> heheh
2011-08-01T03:25:56  <mcstar> sorry
2011-08-01T03:26:08  <mcstar> lisp has macros for like many years
2011-08-01T03:26:19  <mleise> Someone already wrote an object <-> database binding, turning "CREATE TABLE ..." sql commands into machine code :)
2011-08-01T03:27:15  <mleise> mcstar: Yeah other languages have that already and Perl would come to mind as well
2011-08-01T03:27:45  <mcstar> paul graham says lisp has macros since the mid 1960s
2011-08-01T03:28:24  <mcstar> vdpau?
2011-08-01T03:28:28  <mcstar> is that it?
2011-08-01T03:28:53  <mcstar> its supported from the 8th series upwards
2011-08-01T03:29:04  <mleise> mcstar: yes, that is it, one more thing that Gentoo didn't tell me and I overlooked it for years. Same goes for libreoffice. I was still using the outdated openoffice :p
2011-08-01T03:29:05  <mcstar> unfortunately i had a 7300
2011-08-01T03:29:32  <mcstar> well, arch upgraded to libre just recently

2011-08-01T03:30:31  <mcstar> fortunately i dont use them at all

2011-08-01T03:31:41  <mcstar> now i startes to set up my cuda development environment, and i faced with a problem:
2011-08-01T03:31:53  <mcstar> cuda needs gcc <= 4.X
2011-08-01T03:32:00  <mcstar> ah
2011-08-01T03:32:04  <mleise> I actually use Writer now and then, but I hate that the Gentoo ebuild doesn't offer use flags for the other parts. I'd definitly disable database and drawing functionality
2011-08-01T03:32:05  <mcstar> <=4.4.X
2011-08-01T03:32:43  <mcstar> mleise: arent you tired of configuring every package in such details?
2011-08-01T03:32:44  <mleise> oh... and maybe also an outdated glibc
2011-08-01T03:33:06  <mcstar> i might have asked this before...
2011-08-01T03:33:16  <mleise> mcstar: no, because libreoffice takes literally hours to compile ... which is arguably again the 'fault' of using gentoo :p
2011-08-01T03:34:53  <mleise> mcstar: There are other use flags that I consider 'details'. Like 'minimal' on nano. It makes nano unaware of terminal resizing :p. Yes, I tried it
2011-08-01T03:35:15  <mcstar> hm
2011-08-01T03:35:19  <mcstar> im
2011-08-01T03:35:25  <mcstar> im perplexed
2011-08-01T03:35:51  <mcstar> i mean nano?
2011-08-01T03:36:13  <mcstar> and paying attention to such details requires a mental process
2011-08-01T03:36:13  <mleise> nano the tiny little text editor, yes it can become even tinier and more minimalistic
2011-08-01T03:36:29  <mcstar> i mean doesnt it make you tired and angry?
2011-08-01T03:36:31  <mcstar> :D
2011-08-01T03:36:39  <mcstar> i would make me
2011-08-01T03:37:00  <mcstar> well, recently i compiled emacs, to change 1 flag
2011-08-01T03:37:22  <mcstar> i wo...->it wou..
2011-08-01T03:37:23  <mleise> I was recompiling my system to 64-bit. While I could cook and iron clothes and the like I also checked some of the use flags.
2011-08-01T03:37:41  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-01T03:37:53  <mleise> Practically I think I should now have an awesome low memory footprint, right?
2011-08-01T03:38:03  <mcstar> what size do you wear?
2011-08-01T03:38:20  <mcstar> i have 43 sized feet
2011-08-01T03:38:38  <mleise> -.- me too
2011-08-01T03:38:53  <mcstar> not that low, is it?
2011-08-01T03:38:59  <mcstar> and i didnt change my flags
2011-08-01T03:39:20  <mcstar> clearly you are a computer-enthusisast

2011-08-01T03:41:43  <mcstar> i had a terrible week the last week
2011-08-01T03:41:53  <mcstar> i started on a new job
2011-08-01T03:42:02  <mleise> that's not that bad
2011-08-01T03:42:12  <mcstar> (well, new assignment, same place)
2011-08-01T03:42:31  <mcstar> and my old machine's hdd had problems, lost my data
2011-08-01T03:42:32  <mleise> oh that's more the mediocre type of 'new'
2011-08-01T03:42:46  <mleise> shit, make backups!
2011-08-01T03:42:57  <mcstar> then, on wednesday, my mother got hit my a car
2011-08-01T03:43:02  <mcstar> by
2011-08-01T03:43:15  <mcstar> i was visiting the hospital
2011-08-01T03:43:15  <mleise> did she get injured?
2011-08-01T03:43:27  <mcstar> sort of, fortunately not really bad
2011-08-01T03:43:34  <mcstar> concussion
2011-08-01T03:43:42  <mcstar> and contusions?
2011-08-01T03:43:55  <mcstar> im not sure of the right word
2011-08-01T03:44:12  <mcstar> then i had bad sectors on my drive at home
2011-08-01T03:44:49  <mcstar> so i was recovering data, and running badblocks and smart self tests the weekend
2011-08-01T03:45:12  <mleise> Did you lose anything important?

2011-08-01T03:46:06  <mcstar> on my work machine, now everything is gone, but i stored mainly things like star trek the next generation, house m.d. and a couple of bluray movies on it
2011-08-01T03:46:23  <mcstar> 700gb of entertainment
2011-08-01T03:46:47  <mleise> oh crap! and you can't even blame your boss for the bad hardware
2011-08-01T03:46:50  <mcstar> but i had a couple 100 mbs of important data too
2011-08-01T03:47:27  <mcstar> well, they were using wdc caviar green's, a lot of them
2011-08-01T03:47:35  <mcstar> and at one point they started to die
2011-08-01T03:47:40  <mleise> sigh, I'd be down from that too. It takes a long time to acquire 700gb of movies/music
2011-08-01T03:47:52  <mcstar> the lost quite a few of them, with simulation data on them
2011-08-01T03:48:00  <mcstar> they*
2011-08-01T03:48:15  <mcstar> it was a faulty series
2011-08-01T03:48:19  <mleise> caviar hdd hmm... actually I heard about them dying like 5 years ago
2011-08-01T03:48:21  <mcstar> the drive kept parking the heads
2011-08-01T03:48:37  <mcstar> they were <2 years old i think
2011-08-01T03:48:40  <mcstar> but im not sure
2011-08-01T03:48:52  <mcstar> fuckno
2011-08-01T03:48:56  <mcstar> 1 year old
2011-08-01T03:48:59  <mcstar> yes
2011-08-01T03:49:11  <mcstar> but, mine doesnt have that problem
2011-08-01T03:49:44  <mcstar> seems that sometimes hangs the sata controller, and the system cant see the drive anymore, the surface seemed ok
2011-08-01T03:50:02  <mcstar> i think it has a problem in the pcb
2011-08-01T03:50:06  <mcstar> doesnt matter
2011-08-01T03:50:28  <mcstar> i had a caviar green at home too, slightly different model
2011-08-01T03:50:34  <mleise> Oo
2011-08-01T03:51:04  <mleise> are they called green because they save energy by parking the heads all the time?
2011-08-01T03:51:11  <mcstar> 3 bad sectors appeared on it, but a 15 full badblocks test fixed it, they arent listed as bad blocks, and the reallocation count is 0
2011-08-01T03:51:17  <mcstar> no :)
2011-08-01T03:51:22  <mcstar> that was a fault
2011-08-01T03:51:40  <mcstar> they parked the head in every couple of seconds
2011-08-01T03:51:53  <mcstar> im not sure how did the guys miss it though
2011-08-01T03:52:04  <mcstar> that gives off sound doesnt it?

2011-08-01T03:53:26  <mcstar> the wdc's dont have those fields in their smart's
2011-08-01T03:53:58  <mcstar> i think this is quite common, the error occurs in the tranfer from the drive to the contrller
2011-08-01T03:54:05  <mleise> hmm I had strange corruptions in text files when I resored a backup once
2011-08-01T03:54:40  <mcstar> in december i lost a samsung sata, before that, i my wdc caviar black got corrupted
2011-08-01T03:54:58  <mcstar> so you can imagine that i hate computers
2011-08-01T03:55:22  <mleise> Ok, before that happens to me... is there a way to scan an USB disk for bad sectors?
2011-08-01T03:55:30  <mcstar> sure
2011-08-01T03:55:57  <mcstar> the best is: badblocks -swv -t random /dev/something
2011-08-01T03:56:00  <mleise> even with marking bad sectors and all the usual stuff?
2011-08-01T03:56:11  <mcstar> well, i reda about it now
2011-08-01T03:56:28  <mleise> and this command doesn't overwrite any data?
2011-08-01T03:56:29  <mcstar> oyu can mark sectors on the ext* family
2011-08-01T03:56:36  <mcstar> yes it does
2011-08-01T03:56:38  <mcstar> thats the point
2011-08-01T03:56:40  <mcstar> -w
2011-08-01T03:56:49  <mcstar> its destructive, but its more reliable
2011-08-01T03:56:58  <mleise> mcstar: ok so it is a filesystem feature, I remember from the DOS days that HDDs have their own bad sector list
2011-08-01T03:57:00  <mcstar> you can use -n, it doesnt destroy data then
2011-08-01T03:57:06  <mcstar> wait
2011-08-01T03:57:13  <mcstar> you can, but thats a last resort
2011-08-01T03:57:21  <mcstar> you have to run a full smart self-test
2011-08-01T03:57:35  <mleise> smart on usb? i doubt that works
2011-08-01T03:57:35  <mcstar> smartctl -t long /dev/somedrive
2011-08-01T03:57:48  <mcstar> i think that works if youre lucks
2011-08-01T03:57:50  <mcstar> y
2011-08-01T03:57:56  <mcstar> it supposed to
2011-08-01T03:58:22  <mcstar> but yeah, there are compilcations, the best is to pull it from its cage ant put it in the machine
2011-08-01T03:58:29  <mcstar> ant
2011-08-01T03:58:31  <mcstar> hehe
2011-08-01T03:58:34  <mleise> ;)
2011-08-01T03:58:53  <mcstar> well, maybe windows has better support for that idk
2011-08-01T03:59:37  <mcstar> but you could do the badblocks test, it will take long
2011-08-01T03:59:53  <mcstar> just use -svn
2011-08-01T04:00:11  <mleise> svn version of smartctl?
2011-08-01T04:00:17  <mcstar> -s -v -n
2011-08-01T04:00:17  <mleise> ah no, ok
2011-08-01T04:01:38  <mleise> please wait 106 minutes, hmm
2011-08-01T04:01:58  <mcstar> i learned one thing: dont use a filesystem youre not familiar with
2011-08-01T04:02:09  <mcstar> this means, i will only be using extX
2011-08-01T04:02:25  <mcstar> 320gb?
2011-08-01T04:02:45  <mcstar> nono
2011-08-01T04:02:49  <mcstar> 500 right?
2011-08-01T04:03:03  <mleise> I switched to ext4 when it was reportedly stable enough and I can wait that long for btrfs. The disk size is 250 GB ;)
2011-08-01T04:03:15  <mcstar> oh
2011-08-01T04:03:23  <mcstar> it said 120 min for my 500
2011-08-01T04:03:28  <mcstar> and 255 for my 1.5tb
2011-08-01T04:04:00  <mcstar> is it your main drive?
2011-08-01T04:04:04  <mcstar> not the usb one right?
2011-08-01T04:04:23  <mcstar> smartctl -a /dev/*
2011-08-01T04:04:34  <mcstar> but i guess you knew that
2011-08-01T04:04:34  <mleise> "Western Digital Scorpio Blue" what a wonderful name
2011-08-01T04:04:42  <mcstar> laptop
2011-08-01T04:05:00  <mleise> uh yes, laptop and this is the main drive
2011-08-01T04:05:24  <mleise> what do I do *after* 106 minutes?
2011-08-01T04:05:35  <mcstar> ?
2011-08-01T04:05:41  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-08-01T04:05:49  <mcstar> the thing you did before that?
2011-08-01T04:06:17  <mcstar> ironing, baking, cooking, vacumming
2011-08-01T04:06:17  <mleise> lol, no smartctl started the self-test, but where can I read the results
2011-08-01T04:06:26  <mcstar> i said it
2011-08-01T04:06:29  <mcstar> smartctl -a
2011-08-01T04:06:55  <mcstar> it should say test is in progress
2011-08-01T04:07:08  <mcstar> scroll up
2011-08-01T04:07:45  <mcstar> i found notebook hdds more reliable so far
2011-08-01T04:08:16  <mcstar> mleise: you can do whatever while the test is running
2011-08-01T04:08:36  <mcstar> but i dont recommend heavy hdd load, because the test will slow down
2011-08-01T04:08:57  <mcstar> and when the test completes, you should obviously see no errors
2011-08-01T04:09:15  <mcstar> no bad blocks, no reallocations, no pending sectors
2011-08-01T04:10:03  <mcstar> oh, there is a graphical front-end, palimpsest
2011-08-01T04:10:32  <mcstar> gnome-disk-utility is the package on arch
2011-08-01T04:13:40  <mleise> ah thx, that's actually a good gui. there is also GSmartControl
2011-08-01T04:14:24  <mcstar> btw, you cant entirely rely on smart to anticipate errors
2011-08-01T04:14:31  <mcstar> i read the google-report
2011-08-01T04:15:01  <mcstar> it is quite enlightening, and there is not much more reports like that(ive seen none another)
2011-08-01T04:15:22  <mcstar> the one problem, for trademark reasosn, it doesnt mention specific models/vendors
2011-08-01T04:16:37  <mleise> worst value for temperature: 84°C  ... what?!? I hope that is a bug
2011-08-01T04:17:24  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-01T04:17:32  <mcstar> lowest?
2011-08-01T04:17:52  <mleise> no idea
2011-08-01T04:18:01  <mcstar> oh, is it the upper bound? or the experienced upper value?
2011-08-01T04:18:11  <mcstar> they are different, is it in the last column?

2011-08-01T04:20:07  <mcstar> all in all, the good thins is that i found the bills of my wdc hdd, so when i see a problem again, ill take it back to the store
2011-08-01T04:20:10  <mleise> I'm using GSmartTools, and it is the 'worst' column
2011-08-01T04:20:21  <mcstar> hm
2011-08-01T04:20:28  <mcstar> i cant say without seeing it
2011-08-01T04:20:29  <mleise> the norm-ed value is 97°
2011-08-01T04:20:35  <mcstar> i mean those can be confusing
2011-08-01T04:20:50  <mleise> what could 'old age' and 'pre-failure' mean
2011-08-01T04:21:13  <mcstar> tipical reason for that value to increase
2011-08-01T04:21:31  <mleise> ah, thx
2011-08-01T04:22:35  <mleise> only the raw spinup time looks odd: 1508
2011-08-01T04:22:53  <mleise> norm-ed: 189
2011-08-01T04:23:00  <mcstar> ms
2011-08-01T04:23:04  <mcstar> 1508 ms
2011-08-01T04:23:28  <mcstar> dont pay attention to that normed value
2011-08-01T04:23:38  <mcstar> i dont know who is Norm
2011-08-01T04:23:57  <mleise> how do I know what is considered 'too long' then :p
2011-08-01T04:25:45  <mcstar> you simply shouldnt care
2011-08-01T04:26:09  <mleise> but I want to care about details
2011-08-01T04:26:11  <mcstar> the important fields are the ones i told you about
2011-08-01T04:26:25  <mcstar> mleise: well, that your problem now
2011-08-01T04:26:28  <mcstar> read up
2011-08-01T04:26:35  <mcstar> :D
2011-08-01T04:27:42  <mleise> hmm
2011-08-01T04:28:01  <mleise> i hope the self test will be self explanatory
2011-08-01T04:30:12  *** sir_macelon <sir_macelon!c06482e5@gateway/web/freenode/ip.192.100.130.229> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-08-01T04:30:52  <mcstar> if it runs ok, then you wont see a difference
2011-08-01T04:30:58  <mcstar> hehe
2011-08-01T04:31:49  <mcstar> theres no fireworks on your desktop saying: you are a real hero, you are smart-a-ok
2011-08-01T04:32:30  <mleise> yeah I wasn't expecting that.
2011-08-01T04:33:24  <mleise> But since this is a gnome gui application i DO expect a dialog saying "no errors"
2011-08-01T04:33:28  <mcstar> (im exaggerating, because i am.... still funny)
2011-08-01T04:33:49  <mcstar> you initiated the test from the console
2011-08-01T04:33:52  <mleise> you are funny like someone who is really pissed
2011-08-01T04:34:14  <mleise> mcstar: but then I over-initiated it from palim... whatever
2011-08-01T04:34:43  <mcstar> :S
2011-08-01T04:34:54  <rabidus> :<
2011-08-01T04:34:55  <mleise> and I also have GSmartControl running at the same time
2011-08-01T04:34:58  <mcstar> it will say disk is healthy in green
2011-08-01T04:35:26  <mcstar> but otherwise, you can run it as a daemon or whatever
2011-08-01T04:35:33  <mcstar> i think ubuntu does this by default
2011-08-01T04:35:46  <mcstar> and it alerts you by desktop notifications if somethings wrong
2011-08-01T04:36:11  <mleise> mcstar: yes that's a great feature, it told me my battery was dying, 2 days before it did die
2011-08-01T04:36:21  <mcstar> lucky you
2011-08-01T04:36:32  <mcstar> damn thing made you buy a new battery
2011-08-01T04:36:45  <mleise> i didn't :p it is a desktop replacement
2011-08-01T04:37:04  <mcstar> the one thing it didnt tell you, is that it MADE the battery die, by running in the background
2011-08-01T04:37:10  <mleise> I don't want to pay 200+ € for a new battery
2011-08-01T04:37:33  <mcstar> expensive things
2011-08-01T04:37:50  <mleise> hehe, no the battery really died from bad quality, high temperatures and low discharging
2011-08-01T04:38:02  <mcstar> (i was kidding again as always)
2011-08-01T04:38:16  <mcstar> pfff, i need to get back and get a working gcc
2011-08-01T04:38:18  <mleise> mcstar: they are out of stock and 9 cell, so I can get them from a reseller now for twice the price
2011-08-01T04:38:30  <mcstar> :S:S:S
2011-08-01T04:38:37  <mcstar> really?
2011-08-01T04:38:45  <mleise> really -.- it makes me sad
2011-08-01T04:38:52  <mcstar> i can imagine
2011-08-01T04:39:46  <mcstar> the problem is that we are fed bullshit
2011-08-01T04:40:10  <mcstar> they made us believe that whatwe are using are actually good things
2011-08-01T04:40:24  <mcstar> then we are disapointed when something bad happens
2011-08-01T04:41:05  <mcstar> everything is really, of quite bad quality
2011-08-01T04:41:11  <mleise> That's absolutly right. Especially with this dell laptop that was advertised with the gfx card and processor + gadgets like fingerprint and camera
2011-08-01T04:41:15  <mcstar> doesnt matter what is printed on its side
2011-08-01T04:41:46  <mleise> the first day i had to get a ram stick replaced, then the left speaker died, then the battery
2011-08-01T04:41:58  <mleise> now the left mouse button
2011-08-01T04:42:06  <mcstar> looks like you win the lottery brother
2011-08-01T04:42:11  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~chatzilla@host-81-20-37-12.eckoh.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-01T04:42:42  <mleise> well the mouse button still works, it just dosn't have feedback any more
2011-08-01T04:42:53  <mleise> so I guess that's second place in the lottery
2011-08-01T04:42:59  <mcstar> ah, good, i was soo worried :)
2011-08-01T04:43:15  <mleise> otherwise it would be a Mac *hint* :p
2011-08-01T04:43:42  <mcstar> well, yeah, they arent really better
2011-08-01T04:43:55  <mcstar> and when that breaks down, you are even more disappointed
2011-08-01T04:44:01  <mleise> but they ARE expensive and use only intel quality hardware?
2011-08-01T04:44:09  <mcstar> pfff
2011-08-01T04:44:15  <mcstar> they are pc
2011-08-01T04:44:28  <mleise> yes, intel pc with expensive hardware
2011-08-01T04:44:33  <mleise> or is it the apple logo?
2011-08-01T04:44:43  <mcstar> no, the genius service
2011-08-01T04:45:06  <mleise> they have a boot loader in the bios though that works with the os, so you cannot install MacOS without hacks on a PC
2011-08-01T04:45:08  <mcstar> they need money to keep dumb-asses in business
2011-08-01T04:45:40  <mcstar> osx expects efi
2011-08-01T04:45:48  <mcstar> the bootloader, i.e.
2011-08-01T04:46:05  <mcstar> but the os needs some kind of identification chip
2011-08-01T04:46:15  <mcstar> that is not on conventional motherboards
2011-08-01T04:46:18  <mcstar> thats why the hack is needed
2011-08-01T04:46:49  <mcstar> but recent motherboards support efi now
2011-08-01T04:47:00  <mcstar> i even  used gpt instead of mbr
2011-08-01T04:47:09  <mcstar> it has a couple of nice features
2011-08-01T04:47:18  <mcstar> but i had to used grub1.99 with it
2011-08-01T04:47:23  <mleise> gpt... yes. I didn't dare convert my HDD
2011-08-01T04:47:30  <mcstar> its alright
2011-08-01T04:47:37  <mcstar> even windows can use it
2011-08-01T04:47:42  <mcstar> but cant boot from it
2011-08-01T04:47:57  <mcstar> not even win7, that a bit lame
2011-08-01T04:48:16  <mleise> hmm, I figure it gives each partition a GUID, that can be used by Grup
2011-08-01T04:48:18  <mleise> *grub
2011-08-01T04:48:22  <mcstar> thats why those mac something is needed if you want to install win on a mac pc
2011-08-01T04:48:38  <mcstar> not parallels
2011-08-01T04:48:52  <mcstar> but some other things i cant remember but you know it
2011-08-01T04:49:32  <mcstar> mleise: no, not that is important(guid)
2011-08-01T04:49:50  <mcstar> the thing is, that it has a little partition, that stores information of all other partitions
2011-08-01T04:50:08  <mcstar> and basically you can sort of unlimited sized partitions and many of them
2011-08-01T04:50:19  <mcstar> that fits modern age requirements
2011-08-01T04:50:29  <mcstar> mbr was very limited
2011-08-01T04:50:32  <mcstar> as you know it
2011-08-01T04:50:47  <mleise> but that's no different from a dozen logical partitions
2011-08-01T04:50:54  <mcstar> yes
2011-08-01T04:51:00  <mcstar> dont ask how
2011-08-01T04:51:22  <mcstar> i read up when i did that a year ago? but i sort of forgot them
2011-08-01T04:51:30  <mcstar> i was convinced that its a nice thing
2011-08-01T04:51:41  <mcstar> and its pretty mature
2011-08-01T04:51:50  <mleise> all I'm really interested in is the cheap partition ID to boot from (without loading an initrd root first and using udev to label disks)
2011-08-01T04:51:56  <mcstar> you only need the right tools to use it now
2011-08-01T04:52:15  <mcstar> ah
2011-08-01T04:52:21  <mleise> mcstar: so you say it is safe to just convert the disk and reboot?
2011-08-01T04:52:30  <mcstar> yes, i remember something like that, efi solved that right?
2011-08-01T04:52:47  <mcstar> so its not gpt that provides that functionality but efi
2011-08-01T04:52:50  <mleise> efi.... I don't even know what that really is and if I have it
2011-08-01T04:52:58  <mcstar> its like a better bios
2011-08-01T04:53:23  <mcstar> mac's always had them (well, not efi, but a similar thing)
2011-08-01T04:53:31  <mcstar> openfirmware
2011-08-01T04:53:44  <mcstar> did you use it? i messed with it on my powerbook
2011-08-01T04:53:54  <mcstar> its very advanced, compared to bios
2011-08-01T04:54:04  <mcstar> and efi is something like that for pc's
2011-08-01T04:54:16  <mcstar> but not compatible with it
2011-08-01T04:54:31  <mleise> no i did not use any firmware except for the binary for my wlan
2011-08-01T04:55:15  <mcstar> nono
2011-08-01T04:55:20  <mcstar> did you have an old mac?
2011-08-01T04:55:45  <mcstar> hm, im not sure when did they changed this though
2011-08-01T04:55:54  <mcstar> maybe the first intels had them too
2011-08-01T04:56:03  <mcstar> its the gray screen
2011-08-01T04:56:19  <mcstar> you can hold option control f o
2011-08-01T04:56:36  <mcstar> and the opnfirmware comes up, a command line interface
2011-08-01T04:56:56  <mcstar> where you can manage everyhting: boot loading, query devices, ports, any hardware
2011-08-01T04:56:58  <mcstar> access disks
2011-08-01T04:57:10  <mcstar> thats why i say very advanced
2011-08-01T04:57:24  <mcstar> it has a whole language of its own
2011-08-01T04:57:42  <mleise> mcstar: no i never had a mac, only pc
2011-08-01T04:57:44  <mcstar> and now they have efi, and recently pc motherboards have them too
2011-08-01T04:57:58  <mcstar> workstations ahd them for some time too
2011-08-01T04:58:10  <mcstar> mleise: wtf? i thought you had a mac
2011-08-01T04:58:19  <mcstar> you talked about it as if you had one
2011-08-01T04:58:40  <mcstar> i dont mean now, but previously
2011-08-01T04:58:41  <mleise> lol, our graphics dude at the office had one
2011-08-01T04:59:15  <mcstar> ok, then i will talk bullshit now, and dont pay attention to the details, since you cant check
2011-08-01T04:59:57  <mleise> I'm just not ignorant to what is happening on the Mac-side and I know people who use Mac.
2011-08-01T05:00:13  <mleise> I remember the times of one mouse button and when IE was supported on Mac
2011-08-01T05:00:32  <mcstar> ich bin dein fater, Luke....
2011-08-01T05:00:59  <mleise> wow, almost right, but with a V instead of an f
2011-08-01T05:01:09  <mcstar> ah, sry
2011-08-01T05:01:47  <mleise> hmm how do i check for efi support? /proc/efi ? :p
2011-08-01T05:02:02  <mcstar> you dont have it
2011-08-01T05:02:06  <mcstar> :D
2011-08-01T05:02:09  <mcstar> im quite sure
2011-08-01T05:02:26  <mcstar> expensive desktop motherboards have it
2011-08-01T05:02:42  <mleise> :-/ at least it is part of IA64, so it cannot be too exotic

2011-08-01T05:04:04  <mcstar> In 2011 Asus and MSI launched several consumer-based motherboards using the Intel LGA 1155 chipset with EFI.[31]
2011-08-01T05:05:10  <mcstar> mleise: efi is like a complete bios replacement
2011-08-01T05:05:18  <mcstar> so its a big change
2011-08-01T05:05:38  <mcstar> but linux supports it on specific hardware, from 200X
2011-08-01T05:05:55  <mcstar> read up on the wiki, i cant tell you any-different
2011-08-01T05:06:04  <mleise> sounds cool. I'll compile my kernel with EFI and see what happens

2011-08-01T05:06:55  <mcstar> it not spread among consumer motherboards at all
2011-08-01T05:07:04  <mleise> :-(
2011-08-01T05:07:10  <mcstar> and much less among laptop motherboards
