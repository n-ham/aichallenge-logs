2011-02-12T00:00:11  <janzert> I only wonder if it's not too generous, but overall yeah it seems a rather nice solution
2011-02-12T00:00:39  <antimatroid> oh wait, i was thinking we can turn into them
2011-02-12T00:00:43  <antimatroid> what if they all became food :P
2011-02-12T00:00:56  <antimatroid> i'd probably go with removing them and setting their score to 0?
2011-02-12T00:01:16  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-12T00:01:24  <jmcarthur> i think it should just be an instant lose
2011-02-12T00:01:45  <janzert> the worry is how much it ends up disrupting the balance of the game for the rest of the players

2011-02-12T00:02:52  <janzert> e.g. if 4 players in a grid and 1,2;3,4 and 4 crashes out, 2 and 3 seem inordinately benefited by it. so by just freezing 4's ants instead of killing them off it is less of an advantage to 2 and 3
2011-02-12T00:03:13  <janzert> but yeah, I wouldn't mind if 4 still didn't receive any score
2011-02-12T00:03:23  <janzert> would seem better actually
2011-02-12T00:04:21  <jmcarthur> well, just freezing them makes sense, too
2011-02-12T00:04:47  <jmcarthur> so how about freezing and setting their score to zero?
2011-02-12T00:04:52  <antimatroid> yep
2011-02-12T00:04:55  <antimatroid> that would seem ideal to me
2011-02-12T00:05:03  <antimatroid> i'll throw that into the spec for the moment
2011-02-12T00:07:22  <jmcarthur> what's interesting is that you could try to detect when an opponent has died and act differently if so
2011-02-12T00:07:38  <jmcarthur> which leads to the counter strategy of pretending you are dead...

2011-02-12T00:26:37  <amstan> this is what i was envisioning when i was thinking about a mmorts for aichallenge: http://www.goblincamp.com/2011/02/version-v0-14-release/
2011-02-12T00:28:32  <McLeopold> if a bot crashes, it will stop accumulating points
2011-02-12T00:28:53  <McLeopold> but, it could still beat a bot that was eliminated before the crash
2011-02-12T00:30:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i'd set it's score to 0?
2011-02-12T00:30:39  <antimatroid> what about a timeout?
2011-02-12T00:30:43  <antimatroid> its*
2011-02-12T00:30:51  <McLeopold> a timeout is pretty much the same as a crash
2011-02-12T00:30:58  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i'm currently doing up a game spec on the wiki
2011-02-12T00:31:07  <antimatroid> that;s my point, shouldn't that be considered a loss
2011-02-12T00:31:33  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-12T00:32:09  <McLeopold> there's no reason to punish a bot that crashes anymore than it not being in the match
2011-02-12T00:32:29  <antimatroid> are you removing all their ants?
2011-02-12T00:32:35  <antimatroid> or leaving them as "non-moving" enemies?
2011-02-12T00:32:40  <McLeopold> no, that would unbalance the game for the others
2011-02-12T00:32:47  <McLeopold> non-moving enemies
2011-02-12T00:32:57  <McLeopold> they can still claim new ants as well
2011-02-12T00:32:59  <antimatroid> sure, but jmcarthur makes a good point that you then want to predict whether an ant is dead
2011-02-12T00:33:36  <antimatroid> i think it's the better solution overall though
2011-02-12T00:34:00  <antimatroid> what's the current scoring system?
2011-02-12T00:34:20  <McLeopold> kills
2011-02-12T00:34:31  <McLeopold> plus food bonus at end
2011-02-12T00:35:04  <McLeopold> what is jmcarthur's point?
2011-02-12T00:35:48  <antimatroid> you want to see if an enemies ants aren't "moving"
2011-02-12T00:36:00  <antimatroid> and you might then want to "play dead"
2011-02-12T00:36:41  <antimatroid> a kill == having an ant in range of an ant dying from battle yes? and what's the food bonus?
2011-02-12T00:37:32  <McLeopold> the food bonus is extra points to the last bot standing, based on the amount of food that would have been spawned
2011-02-12T00:37:57  <antimatroid> do they get points for all the food currently on the map as well?
2011-02-12T00:38:02  <McLeopold> it is to take away incentive for dragging out the game, and to ensure the last bot wins the score
2011-02-12T00:38:18  <McLeopold> I hadn't thought of that
2011-02-12T00:38:20  <McLeopold> probably
2011-02-12T00:38:21  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-12T00:38:35  <antimatroid> okay, i think i'm good to do the spec
2011-02-12T00:38:45  <McLeopold> so, with the input
2011-02-12T00:38:49  <McLeopold> we have 2 options
2011-02-12T00:38:58  <McLeopold> I don't think the options will change at this point
2011-02-12T00:39:07  <antimatroid> i am putting both battle resolutions in there so there's a place with both clearly defined
2011-02-12T00:39:08  <McLeopold> we will just pick the best one
2011-02-12T00:39:16  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-12T00:39:33  <antimatroid> oh, did you see my comment about attack and birth radius?
2011-02-12T00:39:46  <antimatroid> i think attack = 5 and birth = 1
2011-02-12T00:39:56  <McLeopold> yeah, those are still up for debate
2011-02-12T00:40:03  <antimatroid> so attack is with knight moves
2011-02-12T00:40:23  <antimatroid> that gives a nice circle for attack and ensures food squares never actually die
2011-02-12T00:45:08  <McLeopold> I like food squares dying
2011-02-12T00:47:27  <antimatroid> i don't think it really matters or changes anything
2011-02-12T00:54:33  <pyro-> :O
2011-02-12T00:54:37  <pyro-> food is alive?
2011-02-12T00:54:45  <pyro-> i don't want my ants to eat any now
2011-02-12T00:54:48  <pyro-> that is mean
2011-02-12T00:55:17  <antimatroid> :P
2011-02-12T00:55:46  <pyro-> on the other hand i don't care about eating enemy ants nom nom
2011-02-12T00:57:14  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what if battle resolution also treated a dying ant like food :\
2011-02-12T00:57:22  <antimatroid> then we really could call it zombie ants
2011-02-12T00:57:54  <McLeopold> that would be worse than option 2
2011-02-12T00:58:11  <antimatroid> :P
2011-02-12T00:58:26  <antimatroid> i don't really want to change anything at this point
2011-02-12T00:58:28  <antimatroid> it was more an insight
2011-02-12T00:58:48  <antimatroid> other than choosing things, i think the game is pretty well defined
2011-02-12T00:59:05  <pyro-> is it fun and balanced and fair?
2011-02-12T00:59:26  <antimatroid> yes, depends on battle option if you ask me :P, yes
2011-02-12T00:59:32  <pyro-> :D
2011-02-12T00:59:40  <pyro-> battle option?
2011-02-12T00:59:45  <antimatroid> don't ask :P
2011-02-12T00:59:54  <pyro-> i choose howitzers
2011-02-12T00:59:58  <pyro-> or h bombs :-)
2011-02-12T01:01:14  <antimatroid> battle option 1: an ant with more enemy ants in it's fight radius than any of those ants enemies in range dies
2011-02-12T01:01:14  <antimatroid> battle option 2: iteratively remove closest enemy ants in fighting range

2011-02-12T01:05:45  <janzert> didn't that one lead to blocking?

2011-02-12T01:09:22  <pyro-> very random rule :D
2011-02-12T01:09:30  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you taking the last issued command for each ant? or first? or..
2011-02-12T01:09:48  <McLeopold> first
2011-02-12T01:09:54  <antimatroid> pyro-: neither do i :P
2011-02-12T01:10:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i think he's talking about dimkadimons option
2011-02-12T01:10:12  <janzert> pyro-: I think about the only person that does like option 2 is Jeff
2011-02-12T01:10:14  <antimatroid> which led to blocking of arbitrary widths
2011-02-12T01:10:19  <pyro-> if i were making such a game i would have health :-)
2011-02-12T01:10:44  <antimatroid> pyro-: i did that, people didn't like it
2011-02-12T01:10:57  <McLeopold> health would be nice
2011-02-12T01:11:00  <antimatroid> it had home bases too, which you had to try and invade, and take food back there to spawn more ants
2011-02-12T01:11:02  <McLeopold> but may be too complicated
2011-02-12T01:11:12  <pyro-> collision = attack. remove one with smaller health. subtract smaller health from bigger health
2011-02-12T01:11:16  <antimatroid> you could see it in action, but frontiers laptop is off
2011-02-12T01:11:20  <pyro-> collison with food = more health
2011-02-12T01:11:38  <pyro-> or smt ;)
2011-02-12T01:11:42  <McLeopold> every ant can deal 1 damage per turn
2011-02-12T01:12:03  <McLeopold> so, it will spread it's damage to all enemies in range
2011-02-12T01:12:12  <antimatroid> pyro-: play around with resolution method 1, it's so awesome
2011-02-12T01:12:18  <pyro-> oh that sounds fun too :D
2011-02-12T01:12:25  <pyro-> but your not having health?
2011-02-12T01:12:27  <pyro-> :(
2011-02-12T01:12:29  <McLeopold> so, if a single ant comes in, then several ants can take the hit, and save each other
2011-02-12T01:12:50  <pyro-> attack diffusion :D
2011-02-12T01:12:54  <antimatroid> it doesn't need it
2011-02-12T01:13:01  <McLeopold> but, you'd have to track all your ant's current health
2011-02-12T01:13:24  <pyro-> also you could do spawn new ant = divide up ants health :D
2011-02-12T01:13:42  <antimatroid> pyro-: the game is good already
2011-02-12T01:13:46  <pyro-> then you get a choice between mighty single ant or spread out weak ants :D
2011-02-12T01:13:51  <antimatroid> people are generally happy with it, and it's well defined
2011-02-12T01:13:55  <pyro-> :D
2011-02-12T01:14:13  <pyro-> if only one person does like your option 2 why not you using option 1? :D
2011-02-12T01:14:22  <antimatroid> they're the person with the decision
2011-02-12T01:14:36  <pyro-> and they made the decision already?
2011-02-12T01:14:40  <antimatroid> no
2011-02-12T01:14:45  <antimatroid> they aren't unreasonable
2011-02-12T01:14:50  <antimatroid> he*
2011-02-12T01:15:15  <pyro-> i will start being unreasonable
2011-02-12T01:15:29  <pyro-> that will be fun :D
2011-02-12T01:16:05  <pyro-> antimatroid you said its well defined. may i read about it somehwere?
2011-02-12T01:17:50  <antimatroid> i'm writing a spec atm
2011-02-12T01:17:58  <pyro-> oh :D
2011-02-12T01:18:09  <pyro-> then i can already nearly make a starter pack :D
2011-02-12T01:18:29  <antimatroid> you will probably want to wait for more decisions to be made
2011-02-12T01:18:33  <antimatroid> particularly about input
2011-02-12T01:18:56  <McLeopold> input is pretty well defined
2011-02-12T01:19:12  <antimatroid> depending on the option?
2011-02-12T01:19:24  <antimatroid> with the current option, is that moving to outputting info for all currently seeable squares?

2011-02-12T01:21:40  <McLeopold> output land and wall only once
2011-02-12T01:21:47  <McLeopold> output all dead ants each turn
2011-02-12T01:22:01  <McLeopold> so, you must clear your list of food
2011-02-12T01:22:34  <McLeopold> if you want to remember, it is up to your bot to calc the view distance
2011-02-12T01:23:29  <antimatroid> i'm fairly strongly opposed to that :P
2011-02-12T01:23:38  <McLeopold> I know
2011-02-12T01:23:59  <antimatroid> the specs will have that at least for now
2011-02-12T01:24:12  * janzert doesn't understand why not just outputting one line per map row with non-visible squares just say X'ed out
2011-02-12T01:24:31  <McLeopold> janzert: that's the other option
2011-02-12T01:24:32  <janzert> especially if the bots are already being given the map dimensions
2011-02-12T01:24:59  <janzert> it seems a lot easier to debug and look at
2011-02-12T01:25:24  <janzert> and probably easier for the bot to use too
2011-02-12T01:25:25  <McLeopold> it would be, but the starter pack would have the ability to turn the input into ascii art if needed
2011-02-12T01:26:17  <janzert> being able to look at the IO in a text editor and have it make intuitive sense is quite nice
2011-02-12T01:27:20  <McLeopold> okay, let's take a vote
2011-02-12T01:27:33  <McLeopold> option 1, changes only, option 2, map in ascii
2011-02-12T01:28:46  <McLeopold> for a 128x128 map, that's 16,512 bytes per turn
2011-02-12T01:28:52  <janzert> clearly I'd go for two
2011-02-12T01:29:42  <antimatroid> i'm with 2
2011-02-12T01:30:04  <janzert> even though I think raw data sent is a low priority concern, how many ants/food/etc. is the crossover for option 1
2011-02-12T01:30:34  <antimatroid> you can give players the char map of the smallest rectangle containing all visible squares
2011-02-12T01:30:44  <antimatroid> and pass the top left and bottom right coords before sending it
2011-02-12T01:31:13  <janzert> if you're giving them the full dimensions anyway, it seems like extra work that isn't worth it
2011-02-12T01:31:14  <McLeopold> 2064 changes in state
2011-02-12T01:31:48  <antimatroid> janzert: assuming you treat the whole map as unseen at the start of each turn, the difference is reading values to set iterators to and filling in based on that
2011-02-12T01:31:53  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if they have ants all over the map, not connected, that is harder than it sounds
2011-02-12T01:32:12  <antimatroid> McLeopole: store max/min row/col
2011-02-12T01:32:20  <janzert> antimatroid: I meant more from the engine perspective
2011-02-12T01:32:26  <antimatroid> ah yeah, sure
2011-02-12T01:32:32  <janzert> but yes, it's minimal extra work either way
2011-02-12T01:32:38  <McLeopold> yeah, but vision may wrap
2011-02-12T01:33:00  <antimatroid> oh, you're right
2011-02-12T01:33:03  * pyro- just saw the phrase "visible squares"
2011-02-12T01:33:07  <pyro-> there ist fog? :D
2011-02-12T01:33:13  <antimatroid> it'd still work, just show too much sometimes
2011-02-12T01:33:18  <McLeopold> yes, I posted a movie in the forum
2011-02-12T01:33:30  <antimatroid> pyro-: yeah :P
2011-02-12T01:33:46  <antimatroid> and it's n-player not 2 player
2011-02-12T01:35:53  <antimatroid> i almost think the game could be more interesting without the fog of war with the n-players
2011-02-12T01:36:30  <pyro-> how far can you see?
2011-02-12T01:37:03  * pyro- thinks every game in the competition to date has had perfect information
2011-02-12T01:37:30  <antimatroid> i would be very surprised if it changes from sqrt(96)
2011-02-12T01:37:58  <antimatroid> that's using the euclidean metric too
2011-02-12T01:38:32  <McLeopold> it might
2011-02-12T01:38:39  <McLeopold> if we go with a smaller attack radius
2011-02-12T01:39:03  <antimatroid> maybe, i still think it's a good view radius
2011-02-12T01:39:11  <pyro-> fog does make it much harder :-)
2011-02-12T01:39:36  <antimatroid> i think fog discourages the whole see what everyone else is doing and coopeate etc.

2011-02-12T01:41:17  <antimatroid> and kamakazee them into the enemy
2011-02-12T01:41:29  <antimatroid> which also means there is no balance with also wanting to spread out for finding food
2011-02-12T01:41:43  <antimatroid> option 1 gives incentive to clump up, which gives balance to wanting to spread for food
2011-02-12T01:43:13  <pyro-> how will you detirmine whether you want to defend your area or crush a player if you can't see how many ants has that player?
2011-02-12T01:44:31  <pyro-> yes i am asking you to design my bot for me :D
2011-02-12T01:44:46  <antimatroid> that's part of the appeal fog does offer
2011-02-12T01:44:54  <antimatroid> there is balance from that
2011-02-12T01:44:59  <pyro-> apeal? no it make me sad
2011-02-12T01:45:02  <pyro-> start to cry
2011-02-12T01:45:24  <pyro-> i can only luanch test attacks and see if they die or not. i cant actually make any stratagy :'(
2011-02-12T01:46:46  <antimatroid> the rules are set that i think you want to at least fight what you can see
2011-02-12T01:46:52  <antimatroid> you wont know how much back up to send
2011-02-12T01:47:05  <antimatroid> part of why i like the larger vision radius is because you still get a decent amount of visibility
2011-02-12T01:47:10  <antimatroid> particularly once you get more ants
2011-02-12T01:47:49  <pyro-> yes. i can charge at 1 ant becuase i have near him 3 and then find out he has 20 ants just behind one ant and i loose
2011-02-12T01:48:04  <pyro-> then all my ants cry very much

2011-02-12T01:50:34  <antimatroid> until your backup arrives
2011-02-12T01:50:46  <antimatroid> and hope they can't get you dodging through walls
2011-02-12T01:51:27  <antimatroid> the good thing about a smaller attack radius is you don't need as many ants about to still get at least a kill in
2011-02-12T01:51:39  <pyro-> so then stratagy is don't send out single ant ?
2011-02-12T01:51:47  <pyro-> everyone grow out slowly like a mushroom ?
2011-02-12T01:52:17  <pyro-> and you dont know how strong is your neibhour so you must simply keep trying to mushroom out even when you hit him
2011-02-12T01:52:31  <pyro-> becuase if you divert too many forces you may find yourself dead
2011-02-12T01:52:48  <pyro-> if he is stronger
2011-02-12T01:52:54  <antimatroid> but you want to spread out so you can see more and get food as it replenishes

2011-02-12T01:54:20  <pyro-> i know not what area i can control once he is dead

2011-02-12T01:58:20  <antimatroid> that is part of the point of fog of war
2011-02-12T01:58:24  <antimatroid> you don't have perfect information
2011-02-12T02:00:40  <pyro-> yes

2011-02-12T02:05:56  <antimatroid> that was the ant game i made with hp
2011-02-12T02:06:33  <antimatroid> Frontier ^^ there did the visualiser
2011-02-12T02:07:29  <Frontier> :)
2011-02-12T02:07:32  <pyro-> no idea what is going on
2011-02-12T02:07:44  <pyro-> hard to follow. but i think it look more fun than the game you have here currently
2011-02-12T02:08:09  <antimatroid> if you have food deposited on your home base at the start of a turn, an ant spawns, then you have to go out and harvest, attack and invade their base
2011-02-12T02:08:22  <antimatroid> if you invade their base, you win, and there is fog of war
2011-02-12T02:08:24  <Frontier> ok the numbers above the ants are "hp | harvest"
2011-02-12T02:08:30  <antimatroid> i don't know, i think the current game will be quite cool
2011-02-12T02:08:55  <pyro-> pff fog is lame ;)
2011-02-12T02:09:05  <antimatroid> it means you don't know where their base is
2011-02-12T02:09:09  <antimatroid> you have to go and find it
2011-02-12T02:09:32  <pyro-> oh
2011-02-12T02:09:36  <antimatroid> the maps are symmertic, but the start base could be anywhere
2011-02-12T02:09:38  <pyro-> at least you have an excuse for it
2011-02-12T02:09:41  <antimatroid> :p
2011-02-12T02:09:55  <Frontier> the ants can pass on their harvest to other ants closer to the ant hill
2011-02-12T02:10:03  <pyro-> i dont know what fog supposed to be adding to the game here
2011-02-12T02:10:07  <antimatroid> and colliding ants fight to the death
2011-02-12T02:10:14  <antimatroid> friend ants colliding fuse and hp just sums
2011-02-12T02:10:21  <pyro-> to your game at least it add "searching" component :D
2011-02-12T02:10:27  <antimatroid> pyro-: you don't get told the number of players
2011-02-12T02:10:44  <antimatroid> and you have to search out to see what the map looks like
2011-02-12T02:10:45  <pyro-> so its even worse ;)
2011-02-12T02:10:53  <antimatroid> that's not worse
2011-02-12T02:10:58  <antimatroid> imagine real life colony wars
2011-02-12T02:11:04  <antimatroid> they don't know how many other colonies there are
2011-02-12T02:11:06  <pyro-> you have no information to make a global stratagy
2011-02-12T02:11:24  <antimatroid> you have a global strategy to maximise vision to have a global strategy
2011-02-12T02:11:26  <antimatroid> yo dog
2011-02-12T02:12:27  <pyro-> and the only way to acomplish that stratgy apart froming owning the map by which time you've won anyway, is to send out scouts and weaken your force and die
2011-02-12T02:12:36  <pyro-> so you must be content with looking only at your own ants ;)
2011-02-12T02:13:39  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-02-12T02:13:45  <antimatroid> that's still very much a work in progress
2011-02-12T02:14:24  <antimatroid> the bottom is wrong too, i haven't changed it fully from planet wars rules
2011-02-12T02:15:04  <antimatroid> the objective is wrong too
2011-02-12T02:15:41  <pyro-> yes
2011-02-12T02:15:53  <pyro-> you talk of killing enemies and then later talk of scoring
2011-02-12T02:16:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold:  The objective is to have the highest score at the end of the game, which consists of killing the most ants and trying to be the last remaining colony.
2011-02-12T02:16:14  <antimatroid> is that sufficient for the very introductory explanation of the game?
2011-02-12T02:16:15  <McLeopold> yup
2011-02-12T02:16:24  <McLeopold> yup
2011-02-12T02:16:27  <pyro-> "and"
2011-02-12T02:16:34  <McLeopold> you must favor fighting
2011-02-12T02:16:41  <McLeopold> and being the last bot left
2011-02-12T02:16:47  <pyro-> what happen if a kill the most ants but b is the last one standing?
2011-02-12T02:16:47  <antimatroid> being the last remaining colony doesn't ensure you win
2011-02-12T02:17:00  <antimatroid> depends on how much the difference is and the food bonus
2011-02-12T02:17:01  <McLeopold> surviving longer than someone else by hiding will not get you a good score
2011-02-12T02:17:03  <antimatroid> read the scoring part
2011-02-12T02:17:24  <McLeopold> pyro-: hopefully you got second place
2011-02-12T02:17:27  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it may cause the end to be a cat and mouse game
2011-02-12T02:17:41  <McLeopold> or, if he doesn't take over until the very end, you may still win
2011-02-12T02:17:55  <McLeopold> antimatroid: how so?
2011-02-12T02:18:10  <antimatroid> you want to run around and minimise the food bonus they'll get
2011-02-12T02:18:23  <antimatroid> i guess you want to do that for survival anyway
2011-02-12T02:18:25  <antimatroid> nevermind
2011-02-12T02:18:34  <pyro-> also. ant from a and b in range of ant from c. c die and both a and b gain one point?
2011-02-12T02:18:52  <McLeopold> if a and b are in range of c, they all die
2011-02-12T02:18:58  <McLeopold> and 3 points are handed out
2011-02-12T02:20:24  <pyro-> "A bot gets a point for every enemy ant they kill." i cant work out how its decided who was the murderer
2011-02-12T02:20:39  <McLeopold> we have a formula
2011-02-12T02:21:21  <McLeopold> every ant that dies spreads it's 1 point out to all enemies in range
2011-02-12T02:21:45  <McLeopold> normally there will only be 2 ants that fight, so it will be 1 point each

2011-02-12T02:22:08  <McLeopold> if you get lucky and kill 2 ants with 1, you get 2 points, they get 1
2011-02-12T02:22:20  <pyro-> then in my situation above
2011-02-12T02:22:29  <McLeopold> 1 point each
2011-02-12T02:22:40  <McLeopold> each ant give 1/2 point to the other 2
2011-02-12T02:22:44  <pyro-> but i killed 2 ants!
2011-02-12T02:22:53  <McLeopold> no, 3 ants died
2011-02-12T02:22:57  <pyro-> when one died i was in rnage. when other died i was in range
2011-02-12T02:23:03  <McLeopold> you killed half of each ant
2011-02-12T02:23:49  <pyro-> XD
2011-02-12T02:24:03  <pyro-> the half of ant i didnt kill can still run around :D
2011-02-12T02:24:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i would have expected 2 points for that
2011-02-12T02:24:20  <McLeopold> 3 different ants all in range?
2011-02-12T02:24:25  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-12T02:24:29  <antimatroid> each player gets 2 points
2011-02-12T02:24:31  <McLeopold> no, only 3 point
2011-02-12T02:24:41  <McLeopold> it wouldn't be fair to bots not in the battle
2011-02-12T02:24:41  <pyro-> thats different to your own rule
2011-02-12T02:24:50  <antimatroid> so if 2 people kill 1 player, each gets half a point?
2011-02-12T02:24:59  <Frontier> each bot gets 2*1/2 i think
2011-02-12T02:25:03  <pyro-> it say if an ant die all enemies in range get a point
2011-02-12T02:25:09  <pyro-> but thats not what you describe :D
2011-02-12T02:25:16  <antimatroid> pyro-: i wrote what that says
2011-02-12T02:25:20  <McLeopold> if 2 people kill 1 ant, then there are 3 ants all dying together
2011-02-12T02:25:25  <antimatroid> but i only wrote that trying to interpret mcleopolds rule
2011-02-12T02:25:27  <antimatroid> atm he is right
2011-02-12T02:25:37  <antimatroid> not necessarily
2011-02-12T02:25:42  <antimatroid> a..b..c
2011-02-12T02:25:54  <antimatroid> oh, you're still with option 2
2011-02-12T02:25:58  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-12T02:25:58  <antimatroid> i'm thinking option 1 always :P
2011-02-12T02:26:01  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-12T02:26:10  <pyro-> such a complecated game
2011-02-12T02:26:20  <antimatroid> it's cool complicated
2011-02-12T02:26:31  <pyro-> i do not agree :D
2011-02-12T02:26:39  <McLeopold> with that, we can still determine which ants did the kill, and the 1 point will be spread between them
2011-02-12T02:26:43  <pyro-> but i can still try and win it ;D
2011-02-12T02:27:14  <antimatroid> McLeopold, if 2 a ants and 1 b ant kill a c ant
2011-02-12T02:27:18  <antimatroid> does a get 2/3 points?
2011-02-12T02:27:24  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-12T02:27:34  <McLeopold> the 1 point is spread per ant, not per player
2011-02-12T02:27:37  <pyro-> floating point scores :|
2011-02-12T02:28:14  <pyro-> or exact fractions used?
2011-02-12T02:28:15  <McLeopold> depending on the attack range, we can just multiply the per ant score to avoid floating point
2011-02-12T02:28:21  <antimatroid> hmmm, i prefer my one again :P
2011-02-12T02:29:06  <antimatroid> i'll put yet another option split in the spec :P
2011-02-12T02:30:29  <pyro-> i know you wont consider it since your gamnes already made. but its why i suggested health earlier. its more easy to see who attack who else and who is just standing nearby :D
2011-02-12T02:30:30  <McLeopold> each ant is worth 840 point
2011-02-12T02:31:10  <Frontier> that is not divisible by 7 is it ^^
2011-02-12T02:31:14  <McLeopold> it is
2011-02-12T02:31:21  <Frontier> wow
2011-02-12T02:31:48  <pyro-> but its not divisible by 9 :D
2011-02-12T02:32:02  <pyro-> or 865 :D
2011-02-12T02:32:04  <Frontier> make that number as large as the max amount of ants in attack range
2011-02-12T02:32:11  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-12T02:32:31  <McLeopold> yes, that would be for option 1
2011-02-12T02:32:32  <antimatroid> you can't get that many ants in the attack range i don't tihnk
2011-02-12T02:32:48  <McLeopold> just the perimeter
2011-02-12T02:33:10  <antimatroid> not just the preimeter
2011-02-12T02:33:15  <antimatroid> the 2 edge perimeter?
2011-02-12T02:33:15  <Frontier> that's what I meant anyway
2011-02-12T02:33:42  <antimatroid> :P
2011-02-12T02:33:45  <antimatroid> so it was

2011-02-12T02:36:07  <antimatroid> scoring would be less intuitive if it's going up 840 at a time
2011-02-12T02:37:03  <McLeopold> the visualizer can divide it back out
2011-02-12T02:38:17  <antimatroid> and food bonus is *840?
2011-02-12T02:38:25  <McLeopold> per food
2011-02-12T02:38:30  <Frontier> McLeopold: About that scoring. Should I do my own calculations or will the replay string include scores for each player?
2011-02-12T02:38:47  <antimatroid> Frontier: the go message is followed by scores
2011-02-12T02:38:48  <McLeopold> you'll get and end score
2011-02-12T02:38:50  <antimatroid> same as end
2011-02-12T02:39:02  <McLeopold> no scores during the game
2011-02-12T02:39:17  <Frontier> yes? no?
2011-02-12T02:39:29  <antimatroid> McLeopold; he;s talking about the visualiser
2011-02-12T02:39:42  <McLeopold> oh
2011-02-12T02:40:01  <McLeopold> yeah, whatever you need for the visualizer, we'll give you
2011-02-12T02:40:51  <Frontier> Ok, I guess with a scoring like that it should be in the replay string. Planet Wars was more straight forward there
2011-02-12T02:42:13  <McLeopold> since the replay string can see everything, you'll be given the wall info once, then nothing but ant, food and dead ant locations
2011-02-12T02:42:16  <McLeopold> along with score
2011-02-12T02:42:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i'm adding a visualiser input parameter for that 840 thing
2011-02-12T02:42:28  <McLeopold> 840 is not set in stone
2011-02-12T02:42:43  <antimatroid> exactly
2011-02-12T02:42:43  <Frontier> therefor it is a parameter :)
2011-02-12T02:42:50  <McLeopold> it's just the lcm of 1-8
2011-02-12T02:42:56  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-12T02:43:08  <antimatroid> that's why i'm making it a parameter :P
2011-02-12T02:43:13  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-12T02:43:47  <McLeopold> javascript doesn't have integers anyway...
2011-02-12T02:44:03  <Frontier> well, I thought it has
2011-02-12T02:44:14  <McLeopold> only floating point
2011-02-12T02:47:30  <antimatroid> McLeopold: does the engine send the bots "go" almost at the same time, or at the end of sending each bot input? and does the timer start after sending go or when sending input starts?
2011-02-12T02:48:00  <McLeopold> at the end of each input, but I like your idea
2011-02-12T02:48:17  <McLeopold> I'm writing the game class, that should plug into an engine
2011-02-12T02:48:23  <McLeopold> so my engine may not be used
2011-02-12T02:48:32  <antimatroid> yeah that's fine
2011-02-12T02:48:46  <antimatroid> hopefully otherwise the engine will at least be made to the specs
2011-02-12T02:49:32  <Frontier> McLeopold: I found a website mentioning an internal ToInt32 function. And I use to write "number | 0" to trigger that and cast a number to an int
2011-02-12T02:51:10  <McLeopold> do you have a link?
2011-02-12T02:51:36  <McLeopold> in javascript, number | 0 would just be a way to default to 0 if number was falsy
2011-02-12T02:51:48  <pyro-> is the non existance of a legal move for either player possible?
2011-02-12T02:51:57  <Frontier> http://www.jibbering.com/faq/notes/type-conversion/
2011-02-12T02:52:09  <McLeopold> not really
2011-02-12T02:52:42  <McLeopold> you'd have to have all ants in a 1x1 space surrounded by wall
2011-02-12T02:53:04  <Frontier> "number | 0" works very well to trunc() floating point numbers in my visualizer
2011-02-12T02:53:12  <pyro-> what happens if you move an ant into an ant?
2011-02-12T02:53:17  <McLeopold> they die
2011-02-12T02:54:26  <antimatroid> enemy ants can't land in the same square if the attack radius is >=2
2011-02-12T02:55:06  <McLeopold> ok, for a game of 200 turns, sending full map is 485,627 bytes, changes only is 42,295
2011-02-12T02:55:44  <antimatroid> so.. char maps?
2011-02-12T02:55:52  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-12T02:56:11  <McLeopold> so, do we want to store 1 meg per game for the replays?
2011-02-12T02:56:34  <McLeopold> do we want to have that much bandwidth taken on the web server?
2011-02-12T02:56:40  <antimatroid> don't you only need the visualiser stuff?
2011-02-12T02:56:40  <McLeopold> janzert: ^^
2011-02-12T02:56:41  <Frontier> I only need the bare bone version
2011-02-12T02:56:45  <pyro-> why would you not delta encode?
2011-02-12T02:57:12  <janzert> so they're within about 10x of each other, sounds fine
2011-02-12T02:57:14  <McLeopold> some think it is easier to debug and code for if you send the whole map
2011-02-12T02:57:19  <Frontier> encode it whatever way you see fit, but i thought the current format was ok
2011-02-12T02:57:34  <McLeopold> janzert: you know the web server better than me
2011-02-12T02:57:37  <antimatroid> Frontier: it's the bot input i want to be a char map
2011-02-12T02:57:38  <McLeopold> are you sure about that?
2011-02-12T02:57:51  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I don't want to change the input for the visualiser
2011-02-12T02:58:02  <antimatroid> that is good, and will decrease the size of game strings
2011-02-12T02:58:26  <janzert> for the replay data, I don't care as much
2011-02-12T02:59:05  <janzert> in either case it really needs to not be stored in the database like the last contest did
2011-02-12T02:59:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold: give me a minute to update that specs page, then see if we all agree
2011-02-12T03:00:03  <janzert> and it would be best if it can be stored in such a way that it can be served as a static file directly by the webserver
2011-02-12T03:00:04  <Frontier> janzert: So replays would be stored as files?
2011-02-12T03:00:45  <McLeopold> janzert: the full map compresses much better, only 2x the size
2011-02-12T03:00:46  <janzert> Frontier: yeah, I think so although someone had mentioned just storing them in amazon storage
2011-02-12T03:00:52  <Frontier> I currently use a http request in the visualizer to download the replays. the web server is 100% static
2011-02-12T03:01:11  <McLeopold> if most everyone uses a browser that requests gzip, we are only going to double bandwidth
2011-02-12T03:01:46  <Frontier> but replays can be cached when there is no parameters involved in the requests
2011-02-12T03:01:47  <janzert> McLeopold: I rather thought that might indeed be the case, and I do expect most browsers will be accepting gz compressed responses
2011-02-12T03:02:31  <janzert> Frontier: yep, although the current webserver setup is messed up in that it sends no cache headers for all requests
2011-02-12T03:02:42  <McLeopold> okay, I'll look into a modified input scheme where we attempt to send only the visible part to bots
2011-02-12T03:02:43  <janzert> that should really be changed too :)
2011-02-12T03:03:23  <janzert> lots of stuff that should get changed :/
2011-02-12T03:03:29  <McLeopold> Frontier: try and get the visualizer to use localStorage
2011-02-12T03:03:42  <janzert> why?
2011-02-12T03:03:46  <janzert> or rather what for?
2011-02-12T03:03:52  <Frontier> have a link with information, im not really a web developer?
2011-02-12T03:03:58  <McLeopold> so a person can store replays locally if they want
2011-02-12T03:04:24  <McLeopold> well, check out dive into html5
2011-02-12T03:04:37  <janzert> hmm, seems like pretty limited use. Just get the cache headers set right
2011-02-12T03:04:57  <Frontier> McLeopold: what would the use case be?
2011-02-12T03:05:45  <janzert> if there were different options to set for the visualizer then it seems like localstorage might be handy for that
2011-02-12T03:06:13  <janzert> but really I think the browser compatibility is still too thin to rely on it
2011-02-12T03:06:20  <Frontier> hmm, yes we talked about zoom levels for that matter
2011-02-12T03:06:41  *** j3camero <j3camero!~jeff@207.219.39.71> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-02-12T03:10:09  <Frontier> janzert: I don't know if JavaScript is allowed to download from different servers now that I think about it.
2011-02-12T03:10:11  <janzert> hmm, only about 5% of visitors to the site are using IE, with only about 1% using older than version 8, so maybe you could get away with it
2011-02-12T03:10:41  <janzert> Frontier: not in general no
2011-02-12T03:11:33  <Frontier> So the replays must be served by the main web server ?
2011-02-12T03:12:49  <janzert> pretty much, possibly a subdomain works too I'd have to look
2011-02-12T03:12:59  *** amstan <amstan!~amstan@206-248-153-79.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2011-02-12T03:13:21  <janzert> but I would expect just to have it come from the main server
2011-02-12T03:14:02  <Frontier> alright
2011-02-12T03:16:00  <antimatroid> i need to add something to input
2011-02-12T03:16:17  <antimatroid> atm it's hard to tell whether you're inputing a char map or the end line
2011-02-12T03:16:43  <McLeopold> if we had 14 players, yes it would be
2011-02-12T03:17:28  <janzert> don't all lines start with a type identifier?
2011-02-12T03:17:49  <antimatroid> not for input
2011-02-12T03:18:26  <McLeopold> we did have 'M'
2011-02-12T03:18:28  <janzert> ouch
2011-02-12T03:18:43  <antimatroid> i don't like M at the start of every char line
2011-02-12T03:19:04  <antimatroid> could I add a T/E line at hte start of each turn
2011-02-12T03:19:40  <janzert> I think it's really worth it to make each line unambiguously identified by its first word
2011-02-12T03:19:56  <antimatroid> okay, i'll do that
2011-02-12T03:20:44  <janzert> lets people do really easy parsing
2011-02-12T03:21:57  <McLeopold> plus, if every line starts 1 char and 1 space, you can make assumptions
2011-02-12T03:22:06  <McLeopold> just chop the first 2 chars off each line
2011-02-12T03:22:15  <janzert> I'd try not to make it 1 char and a space
2011-02-12T03:22:21  <janzert> we might run out of chars :)
2011-02-12T03:22:37  <McLeopold> >:(
2011-02-12T03:22:45  <janzert> but <type> always followed by a space is certainly good
2011-02-12T03:22:52  <McLeopold> antimatroid: how about for bot output 'O' for order
2011-02-12T03:23:37  <janzert> is the game length given in the pregame setup phase?
2011-02-12T03:23:51  <McLeopold> P turns 1000
2011-02-12T03:23:59  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-12T03:24:55  <antimatroid> McLeopold: done
2011-02-12T03:25:08  <antimatroid> actually, looks a lot like 0
2011-02-12T03:25:14  <janzert> ok, although I'm not sure why to use <type> <subtype> <value> instead of just <type> <value>
2011-02-12T03:25:20  <antimatroid> W?
2011-02-12T03:25:21  <antimatroid> walk
2011-02-12T03:25:31  <McLeopold> w = wall
2011-02-12T03:25:36  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-02-12T03:25:37  <McLeopold> let's keep em unique
2011-02-12T03:25:41  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-12T03:25:56  <antimatroid> well that's a single char in the spec, so work one out, i've almost finished updating
2011-02-12T03:26:31  <janzert> that what I'm pushing for, dropping the single char types :P
2011-02-12T03:27:00  <janzert> just go for the full monte and only use the single char types for things that are used a lot and a natural fit
2011-02-12T03:27:22  <janzert> like M for map line
2011-02-12T03:27:38  <McLeopold> too late, the bike shed is built
2011-02-12T03:27:52  <janzert> you're using go and ready anyway right?
2011-02-12T03:27:59  <McLeopold> dammit
2011-02-12T03:28:26  <janzert> so not all types are a single char already
2011-02-12T03:28:48  <McLeopold> json?
2011-02-12T03:28:57  <McLeopold> yaml?
2011-02-12T03:29:04  <McLeopold> xml?
2011-02-12T03:29:04  <janzert> no, just plain <type> <value> :P
2011-02-12T03:29:22  <antimatroid> ergh, i need to do formatting hold up
2011-02-12T03:29:56  <antimatroid> we could make them strings
2011-02-12T03:30:04  <McLeopold> what about bot output, should we bother with the 'O', or just have value value value
2011-02-12T03:30:22  <janzert> does a bot send anything other than ant moves?
2011-02-12T03:30:26  <antimatroid> no
2011-02-12T03:30:29  <antimatroid> "go"
2011-02-12T03:30:36  <antimatroid> yes :P
2011-02-12T03:30:41  <janzert> or better is there any possible future change where it would want to?
2011-02-12T03:30:49  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-02-12T03:30:58  <McLeopold> so stick with 'O'
2011-02-12T03:31:05  <janzert> if yes, then stick with a type identifier for bot output too
2011-02-12T03:31:07  <McLeopold> let's drop the 'P'
2011-02-12T03:32:10  <McLeopold> also, the engine sends 'ready' on turn 0 and 'go' for all others with an 'end' after the game is over
2011-02-12T03:32:38  <janzert> you could specify that the engine ignores unrecognized types, then people can use it to output debug info mixed in with their orders if they want
2011-02-12T03:32:45  <janzert> not positive if that's a good idea or not
2011-02-12T03:32:54  <McLeopold> no, it's not
2011-02-12T03:33:01  <janzert> definitely specify that bots should ignore the unrecognized types
2011-02-12T03:33:11  <janzert> so you can add new types without breaking old bots
2011-02-12T03:33:23  <McLeopold> the starter packs should help with that
2011-02-12T03:34:36  <janzert> be sure to spec it in anyway so no one can cry about it
2011-02-12T03:34:44  <janzert> even thought they still will...
2011-02-12T03:34:48  <janzert> though
2011-02-12T03:35:09  <antimatroid> janzert: i'm quite happy i get to throw it together just so i can make note of such things
2011-02-12T03:36:45  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so, you agree we can drop the 'P'
2011-02-12T03:37:14  <McLeopold> wait...
2011-02-12T03:37:23  * janzert knows the last contest made him evil because he'd be tempted to have the engine randomly add invalid types to be sure the bots were correctly rejecting them :P
2011-02-12T03:37:27  <McLeopold> I'd kinda like the first char to be a good indicator
2011-02-12T03:37:38  <antimatroid> McLeopold: we could drop it
2011-02-12T03:37:50  <antimatroid> we can drop the go's but not the ready
2011-02-12T03:37:58  <antimatroid> because you ened to give people time to set up etc.
2011-02-12T03:38:12  <McLeopold> ened?
2011-02-12T03:38:16  <antimatroid> need*
2011-02-12T03:38:28  <McLeopold> how could we drop 'go'?
2011-02-12T03:38:36  <antimatroid> you know the dimensions
2011-02-12T03:38:36  <McLeopold> that's after every turn
2011-02-12T03:38:45  <antimatroid> if you read M, get height lines of them
2011-02-12T03:38:56  <antimatroid> i'll leave go in, probably makes life easier
2011-02-12T03:38:59  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-12T03:39:17  <McLeopold> because I may only send visible lines
2011-02-12T03:39:31  <antimatroid> how do you explain the input in words?
2011-02-12T03:39:55  <antimatroid> check what it has now
2011-02-12T03:40:29  <antimatroid> ergh, formatting is still hating on me
2011-02-12T03:41:20  <janzert> each line of type 'M' represents one row of the maps with the (cells/squares) being represented as follows
2011-02-12T03:41:59  <janzert> something like that anyway is what I would start working from
2011-02-12T03:43:00  <janzert> I also don't really understand you're radius value definitions
2011-02-12T03:43:57  <antimatroid> the value passed is vision^2
2011-02-12T03:44:04  <janzert> and be sure to send loadtime as the first thing since it is really already in progress when they receive it
2011-02-12T03:44:05  <antimatroid> so it can be passed as an int
2011-02-12T03:44:43  <janzert> say the value passed is the square of the radius then?
2011-02-12T03:44:58  <janzert> or the actual value sent
2011-02-12T03:45:17  <janzert> and maybe call the type e.g. viewradius2
2011-02-12T03:45:46  <antimatroid> done
2011-02-12T03:45:54  <antimatroid> not saved, but it's changed in the edit page
2011-02-12T03:46:06  <antimatroid> i'm stripping out sample inputs for the moment
2011-02-12T03:46:19  <antimatroid> i can't work out how to do text over multiple lines without paragraph gaps
2011-02-12T03:47:25  <antimatroid> oh, now i have i think
2011-02-12T03:47:34  <janzert> it's markdown right?
2011-02-12T03:47:54  <janzert> if so leave two trailing spaces on the line
2011-02-12T03:49:05  <janzert> also need to specify how your location indexing works for ant orders
2011-02-12T03:49:20  <janzert> e.g. is it zero or one based?
2011-02-12T03:51:03  *** choas <choas!~lars@p578F6E35.dip.t-dialin.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-12T03:53:20  <antimatroid> should we send go after the end E line?
2011-02-12T03:59:28  <janzert> it might be best to be consistent there
2011-02-12T03:59:54  <janzert> although I would still just kill the bot when it loses :P
2011-02-12T04:00:43  <antimatroid> actually, i think with M, you can just send end info as though it was go
2011-02-12T04:00:47  <antimatroid> and process end differently
2011-02-12T04:02:01  <janzert> probably doesn't make a big difference either way, bots aren't supposed to be doing anything other than shutting down after receiving it anyway
2011-02-12T04:02:26  <antimatroid> janzert: the point is to send them information about winners/scores so if people want to train with that information locally, they can
2011-02-12T04:03:03  <janzert> for training you'll want to get that information to your bot runner though not the bot itself
2011-02-12T04:04:02  <janzert> but if you want it go for it
2011-02-12T04:06:21  <antimatroid> i don't really want it personally
2011-02-12T04:06:35  <antimatroid> i figure it's better to give people too much info than not enough
2011-02-12T04:07:23  <antimatroid> janzert: can you check the sample input
2011-02-12T04:07:30  <antimatroid> does that look good?
2011-02-12T04:07:43  <antimatroid> other than the fact that it formatted horribly
2011-02-12T04:08:04  <antimatroid> i still need to clean, just trying to get the structure right first
2011-02-12T04:08:49  <janzert> I still think you should drop P also your example loadtime and turntime look wrong
2011-02-12T04:09:05  <antimatroid> ah, they are, so is birth radius for attack
2011-02-12T04:09:56  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I am happy to drop P if you are happy for me to?
2011-02-12T04:10:42  <janzert> if you indent the examples by 4 spaces I think they will be monospaced font so they'll look better
2011-02-12T04:10:51  <janzert> not positive github does that though
2011-02-12T04:11:13  <antimatroid> i committed a their crime
2011-02-12T04:12:11  <antimatroid> janzert: that worked a treat thanks
2011-02-12T04:18:19  <antimatroid> it's a lot neater now, still needs to be cleaned, but it's readable
2011-02-12T04:22:04  <antimatroid> i haven't fixed the examples, they are broken
2011-02-12T04:23:09  <janzert> are locations using a zero based index?
2011-02-12T04:24:58  <janzert> I made a little more reasonable anyway
2011-02-12T04:25:05  <janzert> the example input that is
2011-02-12T04:26:09  <antimatroid> yeah locations are zero index based
2011-02-12T04:26:22  <antimatroid> i'll put that in at some point, although a programmer shouldn't even need to ask :P
2011-02-12T04:26:45  <janzert> remember some languages use 1 based indexes for their arrays
2011-02-12T04:27:05  <antimatroid> learn*
2011-02-12T04:47:10  <pyro-> antimatroid in your sample input how may i discover from what team is a given ant?
2011-02-12T04:49:41  <janzert> by the letter given for it
2011-02-12T04:50:05  <janzert> I believe 'a' is always your own and the other teams start at 'b', 'c', etc.
2011-02-12T04:50:24  <pyro-> ty
2011-02-12T04:50:40  <antimatroid> yes, the first enemy you come across will be b for the rest of the game, etc. etc.
2011-02-12T04:50:43  <antimatroid> i will put that in after
2011-02-12T04:50:52  <pyro-> what is the significance of a dead ant?
2011-02-12T04:51:04  <pyro-> can i walk into it or eat it or die from it?
2011-02-12T04:51:09  <antimatroid> so you can do some scoring internally
2011-02-12T04:51:13  <antimatroid> it's equivalent to land
2011-02-12T04:51:16  <antimatroid> it's just giving you information
2011-02-12T04:51:58  <pyro-> and if two ants have died in the same spot the information given does not change?
2011-02-12T04:53:13  <antimatroid> i don't think you see ants that died from collision
2011-02-12T04:53:20  <antimatroid> McLeopold: do you see ants that died from collisions?
2011-02-12T04:53:43  <pyro-> its not important how they died. if its equivilent to land another ant may walk over a dead ant
2011-02-12T04:53:49  <pyro-> and subsequently perish
2011-02-12T04:53:59  <antimatroid> pyro-: i expect the attack radius to be large enough that enemy ants can't land on each other
2011-02-12T04:54:08  <antimatroid> you can walk onto any dead ant square
2011-02-12T04:54:17  <pyro-> yes
2011-02-12T04:54:22  <pyro-> and some time in the future
2011-02-12T04:54:26  <pyro-> die on the square
2011-02-12T04:54:34  <pyro-> now will i see the old dead ant or the new dead ant?
2011-02-12T04:54:48  <pyro-> if they are from different teams
2011-02-12T04:55:22  <antimatroid> pyro-: with a "starter bot" just take a dead ant square to mean it is land
2011-02-12T04:55:24  <antimatroid> and leave it at that
2011-02-12T04:55:32  <janzert> I think you only see a dead ant for the turn after they die, it's basically just to let you know the ant died rather than simple disapeared
2011-02-12T04:55:38  <antimatroid> you only see the dead ant the turn after it died
2011-02-12T04:55:43  <pyro-> ah
2011-02-12T04:55:49  <pyro-> ty
2011-02-12T04:55:57  <antimatroid> as you don't know where your enemies moved, it'd be hard to work out otherwise
2011-02-12T04:56:07  <antimatroid> you don't get information if one of your ants died and it's out of view of ants now
2011-02-12T04:56:12  <antimatroid> you need to work that out yourself
2011-02-12T04:56:17  <antimatroid> and try to work out who died in the conflict
2011-02-12T04:56:28  <pyro-> clear

2011-02-12T05:00:06  <pyro-> is it safe to ignore the parameter of a P and use the knowledge that the first line is loadtime and the second line is turntime or are the other of parameters subject to change on a game by game basis?
2011-02-12T05:00:17  <pyro-> are the order*
2011-02-12T05:01:01  <janzert> order should be undefined
2011-02-12T05:01:31  <janzert> although it's pretty safe that the first one will always be loadtime, still don't assume that
2011-02-12T05:01:56  <janzert> also the P may go away if I can get that :)
2011-02-12T05:02:08  <janzert> just <optiontype> <value> then
2011-02-12T05:02:38  <pyro-> there is so much redundancy. P, M, optiontype could all be implicit
2011-02-12T05:03:23  <antimatroid> the M is needed
2011-02-12T05:03:33  <pyro-> end 2 0 0
2011-02-12T05:03:34  <antimatroid> otherwise it's hard to see if you're getting map data or end of turn info
2011-02-12T05:03:36  <janzert> there needs to be a type identifier since currently unknown types of lines may be passed in the future
2011-02-12T05:03:38  <pyro-> is not a valid map
2011-02-12T05:03:53  <antimatroid> no, the example is broken
2011-02-12T05:03:57  <antimatroid> i'll fix that now
2011-02-12T05:04:01  <antimatroid> been playing galcon sorry
2011-02-12T05:04:16  <pyro-> janzert: the protocal should be frozen before the competition starts
2011-02-12T05:04:35  <janzert> that was the problem last time, this time the protocol will be frozen
2011-02-12T05:04:49  <janzert> it will be all lines are passed as <type> <value>
2011-02-12T05:05:07  <janzert> you should ignore all types you don't recognize
2011-02-12T05:05:32  <pyro-> if its frozen then im correct in saying that type is redundant :-)
2011-02-12T05:05:47  <janzert> nope the type of types aren't frozen
2011-02-12T05:05:54  <janzert> just <type> <value> is frozen
2011-02-12T05:06:22  * janzert is being a bit sarcastic above
2011-02-12T05:06:43  <pyro-> to change the messages that may be sent to a bot after the competition has started is very bad :)
2011-02-12T05:06:48  * janzert really wants to thrown invalid types at bots to make sure the conform now :)
2011-02-12T05:07:02  <janzert> they
2011-02-12T05:08:33  <Frontier> the message isn't changed as long as you keep ignoring the types you don't know
2011-02-12T05:09:30  <Frontier> on the otherhand... bots that do understand the new types may perform better :p
2011-02-12T05:10:11  <pyro-> sure as long as you can garentee that a bot written with the rules as stated at competition opening are not disadvantaged there is no problem. but if you do so we arrive at the same conclusion that extensibility is not required.
2011-02-12T05:10:57  <Frontier> say there is some problem we discover later on that could be fixed by an extension, what would you do?
2011-02-12T05:11:03  <antimatroid> i am going to remove the P's if mcleopold is okay with it
2011-02-12T05:11:16  <Frontier> The turn limit in PlanetWars was such a candidate
2011-02-12T05:11:53  <antimatroid> or number of planets
2011-02-12T05:12:20  <janzert> yeah, too bad if they're disadvantaged but if we're at the point where we need to change we're probably at the point where that is exactly all they get "too bad" and so long as they follow the spec for input at least they'll probably still run
2011-02-12T05:13:15  <pyro-> Frontier: if i have not built the engine and protocol correctly from the start i am an idiot and will cease attempting to organise competitions that i am clearly unable to. i will not modify the rules ad hoc as the competition progresses.
2011-02-12T05:13:48  <Frontier> but to be fair i must say that i would like such changes to happen at least two to four weeks before the deadline
2011-02-12T05:13:58  <antimatroid> pyro-: you clearly weren't about at the start of the last contest :P
2011-02-12T05:14:15  <antimatroid> what we're doing now was basically done after the contest starte
2011-02-12T05:14:18  <pyro-> wasn't i
2011-02-12T05:14:35  <janzert> there is always a risk that a problem will crop up with the current game, at least we can try and have the foresight to minimize the impact of any change we have to make

2011-02-12T09:13:25  <antimatroid> pyro-: the "starter strategy" is going to be as simple as:
2011-02-12T09:13:25  <antimatroid> for each ant: try to move north, then east, then south then west
2011-02-12T09:13:38  <antimatroid> that way people can download it and make noticable improvements almost straight away
2011-02-12T09:13:51  <antimatroid> even beginners to programming

2011-02-12T09:16:34  <pyro-> im going to sleep now. then i get back from stuff tomorow at early afternoon prolly. then i'll write it. so an ikarus scheme client as per current wiki and above stratagy will exist by this time tomorow
2011-02-12T09:16:38  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what happens when there is only one active bot left but ants from more players? do they have to round up all the other ants before they get the food bonus?
2011-02-12T09:17:32  * janzert thinks they should
2011-02-12T09:18:17  <antimatroid> if we're also adding to the scores of "dead" bots
2011-02-12T09:18:28  <antimatroid> we should probably finish a game where all bots are inactive
2011-02-12T09:18:30  <janzert> also was going to mention the "food" bonus should include all future food, food currently on the map *and* the players own ants
2011-02-12T09:19:07  <janzert> is McLeopold zeroing the score of dead ants or just letting it stand where it is?
2011-02-12T09:19:15  <antimatroid> stand i think
2011-02-12T09:19:23  <antimatroid> although i'm unsure whether the score even freezes
2011-02-12T09:19:39  <janzert> hmm, I wonder what to do when all the bots have crashed then?
2011-02-12T09:19:53  <antimatroid> ^^ that's what i said above, should the game continue running
2011-02-12T09:20:09  <antimatroid> it would be fairly fast anyway, as the bots don't need to be given anything, particularly time to think
2011-02-12T09:20:53  <janzert> seems like a waste of resources to play it out, but it should play out very fast as long as the engine is smart enough not to wait on bots after the first move they timeout on.
2011-02-12T09:21:02  <janzert> so yeah ;)
2011-02-12T09:21:34  <antimatroid> i would be in favour of just zeroing any "crashed" bots score
2011-02-12T09:21:41  <janzert> the engine should record and give the visualizer some indication on what move a bit crashes on
2011-02-12T09:21:45  <antimatroid> then calling the game off and drawing everyone, but i don't really care
2011-02-12T09:22:10  <janzert> yeah, I think zeroing the score is slightly better but I don't have a strong preference
2011-02-12T09:22:13  <antimatroid> I'll add a command for noting the "crash" of a bot
2011-02-12T09:22:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold is just making sure he doesn't get hurt as bad as in pw from crashes :P
2011-02-12T09:22:37  <antimatroid> jk
2011-02-12T09:22:50  <janzert> heh
2011-02-12T09:25:59  <antimatroid> i think that will do me for tonight with the spec
2011-02-12T09:26:18  <antimatroid> the maths doesn't show very nicely for distances
2011-02-12T09:26:33  <antimatroid> it wouldn't let me use the align* function with the tex stuff :(
2011-02-12T09:28:59  <antimatroid> i think the last unclear thing is battle resolution and then playing around with radius parameters/maps
2011-02-12T09:29:10  <antimatroid> and these "end of game" conditions
2011-02-12T09:30:11  <janzert> yeah, it seems to be basically to the point of needing something running to see how or if things really work out as an interesting game
2011-02-12T09:31:10  <antimatroid> even that's unclear till people really get going, but yeah some testing will be good

2011-02-12T11:20:18  <amstan> antimatroid: decent
2011-02-12T11:20:45  <amstan> i should probably make an announcement about it
2011-02-12T11:20:47  <antimatroid> it's still in need of a clean and revise etc. but it's a start
2011-02-12T11:21:03  <antimatroid> we still need engines/visualisers/etc.
2011-02-12T11:21:36  <antimatroid> and we still need to convince jeff battle option 1 is superior
2011-02-12T11:22:10  <amstan> well, make a proposal, have it all written down
2011-02-12T11:22:23  <amstan> irc is kinda overwhelming if someone is trying to convince you something
2011-02-12T11:22:39  <antimatroid> hmm, i might do advantages disadvantages tomorrow
2011-02-12T11:22:42  <antimatroid> but i'm going to bed now
2011-02-12T11:22:56  <antimatroid> there's also a page for starter bot strategy stuff with possible improvement hints
2011-02-12T12:14:37  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you still here?
2011-02-12T12:15:45  <McLeopold> so, my thoughts on bot crashes and scores...
2011-02-12T12:16:15  <McLeopold> a bot that crashes or times out will stop accumulating points
2011-02-12T12:16:27  <McLeopold> the ants will always stay put
2011-02-12T12:16:41  <McLeopold> food can still be turned into new ants
2011-02-12T12:17:09  <McLeopold> this is too keep the balance of the game, to not give an advantage to one of the other bots still in the game
2011-02-12T12:17:35  <McLeopold> the food turning into ants is so that a bot can't tell when another bot has crashed by the game mechanics
2011-02-12T12:18:18  <McLeopold> if all but 1 bot crashes, the game ends and the last ant gets the food bonus, plus a bonus for all leftover food and enemy ants
2011-02-12T12:18:42  <McLeopold> this would be the same score if we let them clean up the map, so we don't need to drag out the game
2011-02-12T12:19:20  <McLeopold> if the last 2 bots crash, the split the bonus, and neither of their ants are included in it
2011-02-12T12:19:38  <McLeopold> the score is not zeroed out for a crashed bot
2011-02-12T12:20:24  <McLeopold> which means a crashed or timed out bot may still get any ranking in the game
2011-02-12T12:20:53  <McLeopold> The reason for this is because I want to emphasize that this is an "AI" contest and not a coding contest.
2011-02-12T12:21:20  <McLeopold> Also, there will be no invalid moves, the engine will ignore them.
2011-02-12T12:21:47  <McLeopold> We could probably make an engine that would report invalid moves, for testing.
2011-02-12T12:22:06  <jbroman> McLeopold: At a minimum, you probably also want to log timeouts so that people know why the bots didn't do anything.
2011-02-12T12:22:21  <McLeopold> yes, timeouts and crashes will be logged
2011-02-12T12:22:35  <McLeopold> hopefully on crashes we can capture 1024 bytes of stderr
2011-02-12T12:22:49  <jbroman> McLeopold: Not sure about that one.
2011-02-12T12:23:17  <jbroman> McLeopold: From a security perspective, it's nice for the bots to have no outbound communication channels other than the moves to the engine.
2011-02-12T12:24:01  <McLeopold> it would be very useful, there were a lot of forum posts of people confused about why their bot crashed.  This would help with that, and hopefully make for less forum maintenance.
2011-02-12T12:24:19  <McLeopold> It's not a security issue.
2011-02-12T12:24:48  <McLeopold> It's captured as part of the game replay and made available to the owner only.
2011-02-12T12:24:59  <jbroman> McLeopold: Well, it's nice that if bots were to gain access to secret information (other bots' source code, etc) somehow, they would not be able to transmit it.
2011-02-12T12:25:23  <McLeopold> Yeah, so, bot owner only.
2011-02-12T12:25:34  <jbroman> McLeopold: I think you're missing my point.
2011-02-12T12:25:37  <McLeopold> Plus, bots control what is extracted
2011-02-12T12:25:56  <McLeopold> I must be
2011-02-12T12:26:10  <jbroman> If Bot A is able to (by some other security flaw) gain access to Bot B's source code (or our API keys or something), it is nice if we can prevent Bot A from sending that to Bot A's owner.
2011-02-12T12:26:21  <jbroman> The debugging advantage may trump this, though.
2011-02-12T12:26:31  <McLeopold> it would
2011-02-12T12:44:06  <amstan> jbroman: perhaps we should allow bots to read eachother's sources, but block all communications
2011-02-12T12:44:24  <amstan> jbroman: if they're smart enough to find the best bot and use stuff from its code, so be it, lol
2011-02-12T12:57:14  <jmcarthur> the visualizer could show "dead" ants differently, maybe
2011-02-12T12:57:24  <jmcarthur> make their colors more pale maybe

2011-02-12T13:06:55  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: that's what I was thinking
2011-02-12T13:07:07  <McLeopold> or just darken the dirt every time an ant dies on a spot
2011-02-12T13:07:19  <McLeopold> then the visualizer could show high conflict areas
2011-02-12T13:09:39  <jmcarthur> heh that'd be neat
2011-02-12T13:09:50  <jmcarthur> turn it a bit more red, like blood :P
2011-02-12T13:10:24  <jmcarthur> by "dead" i actually meant when the bot crashes or something
2011-02-12T13:10:29  <jmcarthur> so the ants are technically still alive
2011-02-12T13:10:36  <jmcarthur> "frozen" would have been more accurate
2011-02-12T13:12:23  <McLeopold> I don't want other bots to be able to determine crashed bots
2011-02-12T13:13:58  <McLeopold> What would you think about having warrior ants and gatherer ants?
2011-02-12T13:14:17  <McLeopold> It would turn the game into more of an economic challenge
2011-02-12T13:14:24  <McLeopold> similar to an rts
2011-02-12T13:15:11  <jbroman> McLeopold: slippery slope
2011-02-12T13:16:09  <McLeopold> it's not going to happen, but it would make for a fun game
2011-02-12T13:16:22  <McLeopold> you have to balance gather and attack strength
2011-02-12T13:16:48  <McLeopold> then we can really call it antz and steal the disney theme

2011-02-12T17:13:34  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i like quadrant 1, but i don't think it's that important
2011-02-12T17:14:47  <McLeopold> I never worried about it with planet wars
2011-02-12T17:14:56  <McLeopold> I just created a distance table and forgot about
2011-02-12T17:14:58  <McLeopold> it
2011-02-12T17:15:45  <McLeopold> if we go from n,e,s,w to 2 cords for a movement, their might be less confusion?
2011-02-12T17:15:56  <McLeopold> or at least people can make consistent mistakes
2011-02-12T17:17:10  <jmcarthur> honestly, even if you're sending NSEW, internally you are probably using coords anyway
2011-02-12T17:17:16  <McLeopold> and for the record, yes, I misspelled 'there'
2011-02-12T17:17:31  <jmcarthur> and coords, but who cares? ;)
2011-02-12T17:17:48  <McLeopold> we will just have to be really clear about the coord system
2011-02-12T17:18:02  <McLeopold> 0,-1 is north
2011-02-12T17:18:13  <jmcarthur> yeah, sending coords won't help anyway
2011-02-12T17:18:17  <jmcarthur> to be more clear i mean
2011-02-12T17:18:33  <McLeopold> it would
2011-02-12T17:18:43  <McLeopold> if someone got their x and y backwards
2011-02-12T17:18:51  <jbroman> McLeopold: Then it's a trivial fix to their bot.
2011-02-12T17:18:54  <jmcarthur> you still have to know what coordinates your ants are at, and if it's a map input...
2011-02-12T17:19:06  <McLeopold> yes, you're right
2011-02-12T17:19:50  <McLeopold> j3camero: ping
2011-02-12T18:11:21  <antimatroid> i'm about now..
2011-02-12T18:12:20  <antimatroid> McLeopold: the point of al inactive ants remaining is they may cause food squares to "disappear" and i was curious whether a non-participlating bot can still accumulate points? if not, do all active ants get the whole weight of killing the ants in the future?
2011-02-12T18:23:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I don't get what you mean about the coordinates being in the fourth quadrant?
2011-02-12T18:23:43  <antimatroid> i also changed attack and birth radius to battle and spawn radius
2011-02-12T18:24:03  <McLeopold> crashed and timed out bots do not get more points, but they keep the points the earned
2011-02-12T18:24:04  <antimatroid> because battle resolution sounds better than attack resolution, then i couldn't use birth
2011-02-12T18:24:31  <McLeopold> sounds good
2011-02-12T18:24:35  <antimatroid> McLeopold: so what happens to the points of a dying live ant when both active and inactive ants contributed to killing it?
2011-02-12T18:24:54  <antimatroid> do the active ants if any exist get to split the winnings between them, or do some of the points go to no one?
2011-02-12T18:25:13  <antimatroid> btw i got rid of my second scoring option, i prefer yours anyway
2011-02-12T18:25:17  <McLeopold> the points are spread as normal, the inactive ants get the claim some points, but they don't get added to the bot's score
2011-02-12T18:25:41  <antimatroid> sure, i'll make the specs reflect that
2011-02-12T18:26:08  <McLeopold> so, some of the points go to noone
2011-02-12T18:26:52  <McLeopold> the point of inactive bots staying is to keep the game balanced for the others
2011-02-12T18:27:16  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i get that, just trying to work out the mechanics of how it will work
2011-02-12T18:27:18  <McLeopold> the point of the inactive bot still getting to spawn ants is so that a bot can't detect inactive bots easily
2011-02-12T18:27:21  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Strategy-Guide
2011-02-12T18:27:34  <antimatroid> does that look like a reasonably way for people to be able to get started improving strategy wise?
2011-02-12T18:27:40  <McLeopold> it's as if the ants all hold, or the bot is still in the game, but doesn't send order
2011-02-12T18:28:01  <McLeopold> no one knows the score until the end
2011-02-12T18:28:59  <McLeopold> I think the improvements are too detailed
2011-02-12T18:29:04  <McLeopold> But it's a good start
2011-02-12T18:29:15  <McLeopold> Here's what I would go with for strategy...
2011-02-12T18:30:00  <McLeopold> 1) know your coordinate system.  (detailed explanation)
2011-02-12T18:30:15  *** Mathnerd314 <Mathnerd314!~mathnerd3@dsl.6.28.53.206.cos.dyn.pcisys.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-12T18:30:29  <McLeopold> 2) the map wraps, know how to deal with this, (same distance and direction algos)
2011-02-12T18:31:18  <McLeopold> 3) path finding, attempt to calculate the shortest distance between 2 points and find your way around walls
2011-02-12T18:31:56  <antimatroid> hmmm yeah okay
2011-02-12T18:31:58  <McLeopold> 4) balance, find a good mix of ants that will gather food and ants that will attack
2011-02-12T18:32:24  <McLeopold> anything talking about specific algos, besides the distance and direction ones, is too detailed
2011-02-12T18:32:24  <antimatroid> so focus souly on strategy and let them work out the implementation of it?
2011-02-12T18:32:34  <McLeopold> we might point them to common path finding articles though
2011-02-12T18:32:40  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-12T18:32:48  <McLeopold> the forums will be filled with implementations
2011-02-12T18:33:04  <antimatroid> consider it done
2011-02-12T18:33:08  <McLeopold> sweet
2011-02-12T18:33:31  <antimatroid> i think the game is pretty much "worked out" other than battle resolution and parameter values
2011-02-12T18:33:44  <antimatroid> less unforseen problems
2011-02-12T18:33:52  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-12T18:34:27  <McLeopold> so, if the game is "broken" as it stands, (with option 2) then we either switch to option 1, or do something else
2011-02-12T18:34:42  <antimatroid> hmmm, i don't want to have to break option 2 to go with 1
2011-02-12T18:34:59  <antimatroid> i am still banking on option 1, surely jeff is willing to at least compromise if everyone else wants 1
2011-02-12T18:35:38  <McLeopold> I agree with him that it makes it a much more complicated game.  It would be fun, but a little to advanced.
2011-02-12T18:35:59  <McLeopold> I think the solution might be to allow full vision and have bots communicate alliances.
2011-02-12T18:36:04  <antimatroid> i agree with you borth there, just not about it being too advanced
2011-02-12T18:36:25  <antimatroid> i think for either game people are going to be attempting similar things to be near the top, why not pick the more interesting game, even if it's harder
2011-02-12T18:37:36  <McLeopold> he's worried about a huge gap in abilities.  I think option 1 give a larger spread, but it would still be linear.
2011-02-12T18:37:51  <McLeopold> so, I don't think I agree totally with his concerns.
2011-02-12T18:37:56  <McLeopold> but I share the vision
2011-02-12T18:38:12  <antimatroid> i think he underestimates how hard it will be to "exploit" option 1 too
2011-02-12T18:38:42  <McLeopold> He also thinks option 2 doesn't have the possibility of being trivially solved, but I think it might be.
2011-02-12T18:38:50  <antimatroid> if anyone uses a tree, i can't see them getting passed using it for any enemy ants at close range 1 turn ahead
2011-02-12T18:39:17  <McLeopold> I couldn't see anyone making a useful alpha beta for planet wars, but I was wrong. :)
2011-02-12T18:39:22  <antimatroid> i don't think option 2 will be "trivially solved", but there's certainly way less balance making it easier to know what you ought to be doing
2011-02-12T18:39:33  <McLeopold> yeah,
2011-02-12T18:39:35  <antimatroid> who made a useful alpha beta for pw?
2011-02-12T18:39:41  <McLeopold> mega1
2011-02-12T18:39:43  <McLeopold> the winner
2011-02-12T18:39:48  <antimatroid> only on the first turn
2011-02-12T18:39:56  <McLeopold> it worked
2011-02-12T18:40:00  <antimatroid> yeah :P
2011-02-12T18:40:12  <McLeopold> I thought about maybe splitting the ants into workers and fighters
2011-02-12T18:40:30  <McLeopold> that would give you a decision to make on how many you spawn of each
2011-02-12T18:40:53  <McLeopold> That would be another change I'd be willing to code if we needed it
2011-02-12T18:40:55  <antimatroid> what would the difference be? workers can only be killed not kill? and fighters can't spawn?
2011-02-12T18:41:09  <McLeopold> workers can't attack, fighters can't spawn
2011-02-12T18:41:23  <McLeopold> so, you need to find the proper mix given your neighbors
2011-02-12T18:41:32  <McLeopold> no workers, no growth
2011-02-12T18:41:32  <antimatroid> hmmm i like that
2011-02-12T18:41:39  <McLeopold> no fighters, no security
2011-02-12T18:41:41  <McLeopold> So do i
2011-02-12T18:41:42  <antimatroid> but it makes things more complicated
2011-02-12T18:41:43  <McLeopold> :)
2011-02-12T18:41:52  <McLeopold> so, you would need a spawn command
2011-02-12T18:42:09  <McLeopold> you are told you have an "egg" and you choose which to spawn
2011-02-12T18:42:32  <McLeopold> then instead of just ant corrds, you get fighter/worker coords
2011-02-12T18:42:48  <McLeopold> so, an ant has an owner, now it has an owner and type
2011-02-12T18:43:04  <McLeopold> all orders are still the same, except for the spawn order
2011-02-12T18:43:17  <antimatroid> can't really display that on a char map?
2011-02-12T18:43:32  <McLeopold> lower, upper case
2011-02-12T18:43:42  <McLeopold> special symbol for eggs?

2011-02-12T18:43:44  <antimatroid> that's for dead ants?
2011-02-12T18:44:49  <McLeopold> I think it could still be simple enough to understand the rules by watching the game.
2011-02-12T18:46:11  <antimatroid> hmmm maybe, i think i'd personally go with with what we have already
2011-02-12T18:46:17  <antimatroid> i like just how simple it is

2011-02-12T20:35:47  <antimatroid> TIL parts of america have curfew laws for teenagers
2011-02-12T20:35:48  <antimatroid> that's insane
2011-02-12T20:41:56  <jmcarthur> those curfew laws usually are just for driving
2011-02-12T20:42:14  <jmcarthur> i've never heard of one that says you must be *at home* by a certain time or anything like that
2011-02-12T20:46:14  <antimatroid> the comments on reddit were very much indicative that there are places where teenagers aren't allowed out past liek 11pm
2011-02-12T20:48:21  <antimatroid> while i agree some age discrimination isn't necessarily bad (driving, drinking etc.), that is insane
2011-02-12T21:00:05  <jmcarthur> well, i was unaware of it. that's kind of weird
2011-02-12T21:00:15  <jmcarthur> my area has a driving curfew for teenagers
2011-02-12T21:00:20  <jmcarthur> it's like 2am or 3am or something
2011-02-12T21:00:31  <jmcarthur> i don't know what time the curfew is over though
2011-02-12T21:01:53  <jmcarthur> ah, no it's midnight
2011-02-12T21:01:59  <jmcarthur> 12am-6am
2011-02-12T21:02:07  <jmcarthur> if you are under 18

2011-02-12T21:33:27  <jmcarthur> sigh: yeah learners requires at least 15 years of age and a parent or licensed driver over 18, and when you turn 16 if you don't upgrade to a license you can drive with any supervisor with a license
2011-02-12T21:33:41  <jmcarthur> i think i mixed something up there
2011-02-12T21:33:51  <jmcarthur> but you get the gist
2011-02-12T21:34:16  <sigh> yeah, similar here
2011-02-12T21:35:01  <sigh> supervisor just needs to have a full licence (and not be over blood alcohol limit :P)
2011-02-12T21:36:16  <pyro-> why are all the radii named radius2? is there a viewradius1?
2011-02-12T21:37:45  <sigh> oh that's sneaky... it's like that prank where you release pigs numbered 1,2 and 4

2011-02-12T21:39:28  <jmcarthur> pyro-: maybe it's meant to be "radius squared"

2011-02-12T21:40:15  <pyro-> makes sense

2011-02-12T21:41:46  <antimatroid> i was lazy with getting my license
2011-02-12T21:41:46  <pyro-> antimatroid: good afternoon
2011-02-12T21:41:47  <jmcarthur> i thought of that because agda allows unicode characters and allows arbitrary characters to be used in identifiers (only whitespace matters for seperating identifiers)
2011-02-12T21:42:07  <jmcarthur> so you could have r² for radius squared

2011-02-12T21:42:50  <antimatroid> i'll fix the visualiser stuff in a bit
2011-02-12T21:44:25  <antimatroid> McLeopold: we need to decide whether blockages are walls or water
2011-02-12T21:44:32  <antimatroid> i think water makes more sense with fighting going over it
2011-02-12T21:45:12  <antimatroid> if anyone has a strong preference I'm fairly indifferent, so I'm happy to go with what other people want
2011-02-12T21:45:22  <flag> why water?
2011-02-12T21:45:40  <antimatroid> dunno, fighting and spawning aren't blocked by it
2011-02-12T21:45:42  <antimatroid> but walking is
2011-02-12T21:45:54  <antimatroid> what's an intuitively reasonable thing to call them?
2011-02-12T21:46:29  <antimatroid> apparently the game making sense to a real world situation is important
2011-02-12T21:46:29  <flag> tall grass? I dunno, somehow I can't really see ants being surrounded by water
2011-02-12T21:46:45  <antimatroid> it rains in a forest doesn't it?
2011-02-12T21:47:01  <flag> i suppose
2011-02-12T21:47:02  <antimatroid> i imagine there are times where their movement is contrained by small water regions
2011-02-12T21:47:24  <antimatroid> but it doesn't really make much more sense for them to fight/spawn over those regions than to walk
2011-02-12T21:47:29  <flag> Why not have the ants going through tunnels and the rest be the walls?
2011-02-12T21:47:38  <antimatroid> what?
2011-02-12T21:47:59  <flag> As in, the moveable area is a tunnel, the non-moveable/spawnable area is the wall of the tunnel
2011-02-12T21:48:04  <flag> such as in an anthill
2011-02-12T21:49:12  <antimatroid> the point is people can fight an ant that is on the other side of a wall
2011-02-12T21:49:25  <flag> is that a requirement?
2011-02-12T21:49:31  <antimatroid> that's how the game currently works
2011-02-12T21:49:39  <antimatroid> and i think it'd be easier to block regions off otherwise
2011-02-12T21:49:48  <antimatroid> which people seem to think is unideal
2011-02-12T21:49:48  <flag> quicksand then maybe?
2011-02-12T21:50:30  <antimatroid> maybe if spawning was blocked by walls we could argue the walls aren't so high they can't fight
2011-02-12T21:50:58  <antimatroid> in fact, it would probably be better if spawning was blocked by walls
2011-02-12T21:51:20  <antimatroid> or if spawn radius < 2 then you can't get a food square in range through a wall
2011-02-12T21:51:35  <antimatroid> i think that's ideal for spawn radius anyway
2011-02-12T22:06:37  <antimatroid> McLeopold: give me a yell when you're about, i want to talk food bonus conditions again
2011-02-12T22:39:12  <antimatroid> we could get beginners to try and gang up on the best player
2011-02-12T22:39:57  <pyro-> i can't decide if i want to represent the map as a group of linked cells or an array
2011-02-12T22:40:59  <pyro-> how will you know who the best player is?
2011-02-12T22:41:08  <antimatroid> go for the player with the most ants you can see
2011-02-12T22:41:11  <antimatroid> and only them
2011-02-12T22:41:21  <pyro-> you can't see shit about who has how many ants with the fog
2011-02-12T22:41:21  <antimatroid> or most ants you've seen
2011-02-12T22:41:40  <antimatroid> you can with the radius being sqrt(96) and a few ants
2011-02-12T22:46:13  <pyro-> i think i'll go with an array
2011-02-12T22:46:59  <antimatroid> oh man, i almost want to not do an actual bot and make my bot the ultimate troll
