2011-12-08T00:32:49  <McLeopold> it seems like the second best method to me
2011-12-08T00:33:51  <greghaynes> Whats the first?
2011-12-08T00:34:09  <McLeopold> something that controls individual ants toward the best path
2011-12-08T00:34:31  <McLeopold> or, something where 2 ants coordinate together

2011-12-08T00:35:07  <greghaynes> I find influence mapping to coordinate much easier than per ant searching

2011-12-08T00:55:45  <greghaynes> Its pretty simple to make influene mapping generate equivilent data to a* or any of the similar searches
2011-12-08T00:56:11  <greghaynes> So not sure why its inefficient for food gathering
2011-12-08T00:56:50  <McLeopold> making sure 2 ants don't go for a pile when 1 ant would do
2011-12-08T00:57:23  <greghaynes> Yea, so you decrement your map based on occupancy
2011-12-08T00:57:30  <greghaynes> that is basically its strongpoint
2011-12-08T00:59:50  <greghaynes> The downside is that you dont get as quick response time for fast changing maps
2011-12-08T01:00:12  <greghaynes> but when the food and ant count grows it doesnt lose efficiency which is win
2011-12-08T01:00:42  <BenJackson> food count is never high
2011-12-08T01:01:14  <BenJackson> it never gets very high as an absolute value and it never gets very high relative to ant count after the beginning
2011-12-08T01:01:59  <greghaynes> ah, well the problem ive noticed with a*/etc is you are doing an exponential algo * num ants which doesnt work out well
2011-12-08T01:02:19  <BenJackson> if you search from food to ants it works fine
2011-12-08T01:02:25  <BenJackson> and food is important enough to handle specifically
2011-12-08T01:02:27  <greghaynes> sure, but then you have to collaborate
2011-12-08T01:02:28  <McLeopold> yeah, I'm working on bfs, search from food
2011-12-08T01:02:49  <BenJackson> well that *is* how i do it so I think it works ok :)
2011-12-08T01:02:56  <greghaynes> and food * num_ants is just as bad as num_ants * food ;)(
2011-12-08T01:03:22  <BenJackson> yes but you're searching from food to any ant
2011-12-08T01:03:24  <BenJackson> not every ant
2011-12-08T01:03:35  <McLeopold> BenJackson: how do you explorer? last seen? influece map?
2011-12-08T01:03:36  <antimatroid> any moveable ant*
2011-12-08T01:03:37  <BenJackson> and the distance is capped anyway
2011-12-08T01:03:39  <greghaynes> but you dont want the n closest ants?
2011-12-08T01:03:54  <BenJackson> McLeopold: various ways
2011-12-08T01:04:08  <BenJackson> primarily an influence-type map based on finding the unexplored frontier
2011-12-08T01:04:19  <McLeopold> do you detect dead ends?
2011-12-08T01:04:28  <antimatroid> i do iterative bfs from uncollected food to moveable ants, and atm i'm not collecting food that doesn't have a seen path to it from a hill
2011-12-08T01:04:34  <BenJackson> if you saw my multi-source bfs that was the basis of almost everything I did in my first decent version
2011-12-08T01:04:38  <antimatroid> well, i'm not searching over unseen land
2011-12-08T01:04:43  <BenJackson> you mean cul-de-sacs?
2011-12-08T01:05:13  <McLeopold> cul-de-sac implies a loop?
2011-12-08T01:05:38  <BenJackson> a path with no outlet
2011-12-08T01:05:52  <greghaynes> BenJackson: so you are doing an influence map?
2011-12-08T01:05:59  <BenJackson> in french literally "bott of bag"
2011-12-08T01:06:04  <BenJackson> +om
2011-12-08T01:06:19  <BenJackson> greghaynes: yes, but how I'm using it has varied considerably
2011-12-08T01:06:34  <BenJackson> originally I just did things like multi-source bfs sets of interesting things
2011-12-08T01:06:37  <BenJackson> food, enemy hills, etc
2011-12-08T01:06:47  <BenJackson> and then each ant went to the closest one of those
2011-12-08T01:06:50  <greghaynes> Makes sense, I couldnt see a better way to aggregate map data though
2011-12-08T01:06:59  <BenJackson> then that got modulated by scaling the closeness
2011-12-08T01:07:10  <BenJackson> eg so "hill defense" was only interesting very locally
2011-12-08T01:07:16  <BenJackson> while attacking was interesting far away
2011-12-08T01:07:34  <BenJackson> now I have those maps but I use them indirectly in various ways
2011-12-08T01:08:01  <BenJackson> since I can immediately ask "how many steps is this ant to *any* enemy ant"
2011-12-08T01:08:03  <BenJackson> not *every*
2011-12-08T01:13:18  <BenJackson> McLeopold: Anyway if you see a dead end then the frontier extends beyond the back wall of it and thus the influence for exploring no longer eminates from inside
2011-12-08T01:13:27  <BenJackson> in fact the gradient immediately flips around
2011-12-08T01:13:51  <BenJackson> exploring is not that hard
2011-12-08T01:13:57  <BenJackson> you just need some attractive force on unseen squares
2011-12-08T01:14:05  <BenJackson> what's harder is maintaining vision long term
2011-12-08T01:14:18  <BenJackson> that's a different problem from most in the game:
2011-12-08T01:14:23  <BenJackson> it's not "somewhere to go"

2011-12-08T10:20:09  <amstan_> it's really stupid to be playing games at that price

2011-12-08T10:50:20  <rwest> Well it looks like it could be, but you couldn't compile and the like on the server
2011-12-08T10:50:31  <amstan_> Minthos: that's only for python and go
2011-12-08T10:50:35  <rwest> it seems it's web apps only
2011-12-08T10:50:40  <rwest> yea that's what I just read
2011-12-08T10:51:15  <Minthos> so unless you could virtualize a worker in a python or go process you're screwed :p

2011-12-08T10:51:54  <amstan_> last time i checked google apps only liked python 2.5
2011-12-08T10:52:08  <amstan_> which is like 3 years old
2011-12-08T10:53:18  <rwest> it's nuts that amazon prices fluctuate so much
2011-12-08T10:53:50  <amstan_> if you think about it, it's supercheap
2011-12-08T10:53:59  <Minthos> seems reasonable to me
2011-12-08T10:54:12  <amstan_> we spent 2000 bucks for like 7 servers running at the same time on average, with 100% cpu usage
2011-12-08T10:54:28  <Surya> Thx a lot for this awesome challenge anyway amstan :] I enjoy it too much (literally, my professionnal productivity & personal life get fucked up :])
2011-12-08T10:54:42  <Minthos> amstan_: 2k/7 servers for how long?
2011-12-08T10:54:49  <amstan_> the length of the contest
2011-12-08T10:55:00  <Minthos> two-three months?
2011-12-08T10:55:05  <amstan_> yeah
2011-12-08T10:55:30  <Minthos> I think 7 regular vpses would have been cheaper
2011-12-08T10:55:37  <Minthos> with similar resources
2011-12-08T10:55:52  <amstan_> similar resources? 17GB of ram each and dual core xeons?
2011-12-08T10:55:59  <Minthos> hmm.. perhaps not
2011-12-08T10:56:05  <Minthos> but the memory seems overkill
2011-12-08T10:56:09  <amstan_> and an interface to start and stop them at will?
2011-12-08T10:56:12  <amstan_> not really
2011-12-08T10:56:18  <amstan_> you have 1.5B limit per bot
2011-12-08T10:56:27  <amstan_> you have at most 8 bots running at the same time
2011-12-08T10:56:34  <amstan_> 1.5GB*
2011-12-08T10:56:46  <Minthos> yeah 1.5 GB per bot seems overkill
2011-12-08T10:56:47  <amstan_> so that's 12GB
2011-12-08T10:56:55  <amstan_> Minthos: java doesn't start otherwise

2011-12-08T10:59:10  <Minthos> and cloud computing is popular for people who have workloads that flucutate a lot
2011-12-08T10:59:23  <Minthos> so amazon needs to have capacity to handle peak demand
2011-12-08T10:59:41  <Minthos> so they price resources higher when there is much demand, and lower when there is less
2011-12-08T10:59:57  <Minthos> makes perfect sense :)

2011-12-08T11:16:42  <besh> can't you move to a food location ? I got a move blocked error
2011-12-08T11:17:00  <pairofdice> You can't
2011-12-08T11:17:15  <thestinger> food spawns at the end of the turn, and you're told about it at the start of the turn
2011-12-08T11:17:19  <thestinger> so it can be next to your ants
2011-12-08T11:17:33  <rwest> don't you automatically collect them when near?
2011-12-08T11:17:40  <rwest> I have never had this problem and I should
2011-12-08T11:17:42  <thestinger> yes, during the turn - not in between them
2011-12-08T11:17:58  <besh> well i thought so too but food can be dropped close to your ant I think..
2011-12-08T11:18:01  <rwest> unless!
2011-12-08T11:18:14  <rwest> maybe the java start package calls i occupied
2011-12-08T11:18:16  <thestinger> food can spawn next to one of your ants at the end of the turn (when food spawns :P)
2011-12-08T11:18:18  <rwest> it
2011-12-08T11:18:32  <thestinger> and then it will be 1 distance from your ant at the start of the turn
2011-12-08T11:18:38  <thestinger> and movement happens before food is gathered
2011-12-08T11:18:42  <besh> thestinger: yes
2011-12-08T11:19:40  <rwest> hmm I have never seen the issue yet I have nothing preventing it
2011-12-08T11:20:00  <thestinger> it doesn't really matter, your move will just be blocked and you'll gather the food
2011-12-08T11:20:33  <rwest> well still a wast of a turn
2011-12-08T11:20:33  <thestinger> I wrote a special case to deal with it just to get rid of the warnings though
2011-12-08T11:20:42  <besh> yes that is what happened.
2011-12-08T11:20:58  <rwest> I can just modify the check to see if it's unoccupied
2011-12-08T11:21:01  <besh> thestinger: wow too cautions :)
2011-12-08T11:21:09  <besh> cautious*
2011-12-08T11:21:35  <thestinger> well, if 2 ants are next to a food I only want one to stay
2011-12-08T11:21:54  <thestinger> well I guess that would happen anyway if I ignored food blocking movement...
2011-12-08T11:22:48  <thestinger> I think I might improve my bot again today, for the first time in over a week :P

2011-12-08T11:26:15  <rwest> if it's labeled land it has no food on it
2011-12-08T11:26:19  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-08T11:26:31  <besh> yes it excludes that but my A* excludes only water. Got to fix that
2011-12-08T11:26:52  <thestinger> the food won't be there once gathered though
2011-12-08T11:27:08  <thestinger> so you might as well pathfind through it
2011-12-08T11:27:14  <rwest> add it to the isPassible() if you are using java besh
2011-12-08T11:27:26  <rwest> assuming you use that to check for water
2011-12-08T11:28:00  <besh> I assume food is passable for A*
2011-12-08T11:28:01  <McLeopold> I think the only time food would block a path is if it spawned next to an ant
2011-12-08T11:28:13  <thestinger> McLeopold: yeah :)
2011-12-08T11:28:15  <McLeopold> otherwise walking "through" it will gather it and not slow you down
2011-12-08T11:28:27  <rwest> I check my moves right before do them
2011-12-08T11:28:36  <thestinger> if I didn't handle food spawning next to ants, I think it would end up being the same behavior as what I do now
2011-12-08T11:28:40  <rwest> as a secondary check
2011-12-08T11:28:48  <thestinger> because I would try to have one of the ants it spawned next to move onto it
2011-12-08T11:28:50  <thestinger> and they would stay there
2011-12-08T11:29:05  <thestinger> which is exactly what I do now (I make one of the ants next to it stay there to gather it)
2011-12-08T11:29:59  <matthewd> thestinger: Though if you think they're moving, you'd risk a collision
2011-12-08T11:30:23  <thestinger> ah yeah, that's why I fixed it :)
2011-12-08T11:30:25  <rwest> if it happens, my ant will stay there or move a space along in it the direction of it's next target
2011-12-08T11:30:27  <thestinger> now I remember xD

2011-12-08T12:37:06  <thestinger> hm, I think memetix does things a bit differently than how I coded it
2011-12-08T12:37:50  <rwest> too... much... kfc...
2011-12-08T12:37:50  <rwest> ugh
2011-12-08T12:38:53  <thestinger> so for the "best ant", he just means ant within attackradius+1 with the minimum number of enemies in range, right?
2011-12-08T12:39:04  <thestinger> I already do that
2011-12-08T12:39:43  <thestinger> oh well, time to figure out why my bot isn't nearly that good :P
2011-12-08T12:42:00  <a1k0n> his method seems like it works well in mazes and confined areas but is too conservative in open spaces
2011-12-08T12:43:09  <BenJackson> I might implement it just to have it to fight against
2011-12-08T12:43:23  <thestinger> yeah, I'm implementing it right now just so I can compare
2011-12-08T12:43:37  <a1k0n> it's similar to what you're doing anyway Ben isn't it?  at last for enemy ants?
2011-12-08T12:43:45  <a1k0n> s/last/least/
2011-12-08T12:44:59  <BenJackson> mine is probably more similar to what I've heard peopel describe here where they assume all enemies are stationary
2011-12-08T12:45:10  <BenJackson> i just multiply all enemies by everywhere they could go
2011-12-08T12:45:13  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-08T12:45:16  <BenJackson> and fight against all those at once
2011-12-08T12:45:19  <thestinger> I just move them towards me (without collisions)
2011-12-08T12:45:29  <thestinger> and pretend they are staying still (so 2 scenarios)
2011-12-08T12:45:30  <a1k0n> that's pretty much what the influence map is
2011-12-08T12:45:41  <BenJackson> yes, I agree
2011-12-08T12:46:02  <BenJackson> but then I consider individual sets of moves against that
2011-12-08T12:46:08  <thestinger> this influence map method is a lot more cautious than mine
2011-12-08T12:46:20  <BenJackson> if my code lacks anything it's probabilities for where the enemies would go
2011-12-08T12:46:21  <thestinger> because it basically multiplies ants in all directions
2011-12-08T12:46:29  <BenJackson> so I might implement his combat to weight the probabilities of the enemy ants
2011-12-08T12:46:49  <a1k0n> the thing is, it's equally cautious and reckless cause he multiplies his own ants the same way
2011-12-08T12:46:56  <rwest> lol implement his combat so you can predict his moves
2011-12-08T12:47:01  <BenJackson> http://paste.aichallenge.org/Xz0Gl/
2011-12-08T12:47:07  <BenJackson> rwest: well if he can do it in a few ms in java...
2011-12-08T12:47:26  <BenJackson> btw that's what I finally did last night
2011-12-08T12:47:41  <BenJackson> I was inspired by the fog of war at the end of a pguillory game to just go ahead and directly maximize vis
2011-12-08T12:47:53  <BenJackson> so if you slide to the end there and hit fog you can see how nicely it works out
2011-12-08T12:47:56  <rwest> I have a similar combat on my bot and I couldn't figure out why it sucked
2011-12-08T12:48:03  <rwest> I need to separate it out from my main map
2011-12-08T12:48:07  <BenJackson> didn't cost any more than my other method which was far more dense
2011-12-08T12:48:12  <a1k0n> that's pretty much what i've been doing all along
2011-12-08T12:48:14  <rwest> since I spread the values too much
2011-12-08T12:48:24  <a1k0n> my ants don't bother scouting over known water either
2011-12-08T12:48:56  <BenJackson> my currently submitted bot tried to be within some number of steps (4? 5? I forget) of everything
2011-12-08T12:49:03  <BenJackson> it works well for some things
2011-12-08T12:49:10  <BenJackson> but it's too dense far from teh fight

2011-12-08T12:49:56  <pairofdice> If you have ants moving from hills you don't have to have stationary ants at all, if you keep track of the perimeter

2011-12-08T12:51:19  <BenJackson> you can force the lone ant to die with 3 but it can trade you

2011-12-08T12:57:38  <BenJackson> bhickey is for lower level competition

2011-12-08T13:00:36  <thestinger> I guess he _always_ moves toward the enemy?
2011-12-08T13:01:41  <pairofdice> He masks the tiles on which ants can attack on the next turn
2011-12-08T13:02:03  <pairofdice> just adds up the number of ants that a tile can be attacked by
2011-12-08T13:02:20  <thestinger> yeah, I get that
2011-12-08T13:02:24  <thestinger> I've been doing it all along
2011-12-08T13:02:38  <thestinger> but then he's pretending all his ants are moving towards the enemy, before he decides to do that
2011-12-08T13:02:41  <thestinger> basically
2011-12-08T13:02:44  <pairofdice> oh
2011-12-08T13:02:59  <BenJackson> I don't think so
2011-12-08T13:03:03  <BenJackson> he's pretending all ants move everywhere
2011-12-08T13:03:18  <thestinger> yeah, so lets say he has 2 ants out of range of an enemy

2011-12-08T13:03:26  <thestinger> he's pretending the enemy moves every direction, and his own ants do
2011-12-08T13:03:29  <thestinger> so he can kill the enemy
2011-12-08T13:03:40  <thestinger> but he must be forcing both his ants to then move towards the enemy
2011-12-08T13:03:51  <thestinger> otherwise one might think 'hey!, it's safe!', but it's not
2011-12-08T13:03:58  <thestinger> unless all ants attack if possible
2011-12-08T13:04:06  <pairofdice> Yeah, that's an issue
2011-12-08T13:04:14  <thestinger> I can easily work this into what I already do

2011-12-08T13:18:02  <pairofdice> O_o
2011-12-08T13:18:54  <thestinger> like, moving into tiles with 0 (SAFE) could be lethal if your other ants don't move where they are supposed to
2011-12-08T13:19:23  <pairofdice> Yes, but you can control what your ants
2011-12-08T13:19:30  <pairofdice> do
2011-12-08T13:19:39  <thestinger> yeah, but lets say the enemy is on both sides of you
2011-12-08T13:19:44  <thestinger> so if you attack one way, you can beat them
2011-12-08T13:19:49  <thestinger> if you attack the other, you can too

2011-12-08T13:21:32  <pairofdice> heh
2011-12-08T13:22:28  <rwest> thestinger: you have to diffuse the map

2011-12-08T13:23:16  <rwest> 't completely read the thread hah
2011-12-08T13:23:29  <rwest> but I assume he is doing a typical influence map
2011-12-08T13:23:36  <rwest> and diffusing the values afterwards
2011-12-08T13:25:04  <besh> i don't think there is diffusion.
2011-12-08T13:25:22  <rwest> ahh, then it is not exactly like mine heh
2011-12-08T13:26:13  <thestinger> rwest: yeah, he just doesn't move into tiles marked as DIE (2 in my map)
2011-12-08T13:26:16  <besh> so did you guys figure out what the best ant is used for ? In other words,how is fighting[p][r][c] determined ?
2011-12-08T13:26:37  <thestinger> sec, I'll explain how I interpreted it
2011-12-08T13:26:38  <thestinger> so
2011-12-08T13:27:04  <thestinger> first of all, I'm putting all this in the Square struct the C++ starter has
2011-12-08T13:27:16  <thestinger> so then I access stuff like grid[row][col].influence[player]
2011-12-08T13:27:37  <thestinger> anyway, for each Square, I make an influence array that holds the number of ants within attackradius+1 for each player
2011-12-08T13:27:53  <thestinger> and a total_influence int with the total number of ants
2011-12-08T13:28:03  <besh> so far so good
2011-12-08T13:28:29  <thestinger> then I make a 'fighting' array (for each player), which is 'total - influence[player]'
2011-12-08T13:28:31  <thestinger> so
2011-12-08T13:28:36  <thestinger> the number of enemies within attackradius+1
2011-12-08T13:29:02  <thestinger> then I go through each tile to decide whether to mark them as DIE or KILL (they are all set to SAFE at the start of the turn)
2011-12-08T13:29:33  <besh> wait
2011-12-08T13:29:48  <besh> He said "enemies = total[row][col] - influence[player][row][col]"
2011-12-08T13:29:52  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-08T13:30:00  <thestinger> so
2011-12-08T13:30:17  <thestinger> enemies[player] = total - influence[player] for each tile
2011-12-08T13:30:19  <besh> "the best ant being the one that is fighting the least number of other ants"
2011-12-08T13:30:26  <thestinger> yes
2011-12-08T13:30:33  <thestinger> so when I look around each tile (to mark them as DIE or KILL)
2011-12-08T13:30:46  <thestinger> if I find an enemy ant in attackradius+1, I check the # of enemies that ant has
2011-12-08T13:30:55  <besh> so fighting[p][r][c] is not same as number of enemies

2011-12-08T13:31:48  <thestinger> i.e. fighting[0][0][0] would contain the number of enemy ants an ant at (0,0) belonging to player 0 would be fighting.
2011-12-08T13:31:51  <thestinger> that's what he says
2011-12-08T13:31:53  <thestinger> so I just did that
2011-12-08T13:32:04  <thestinger> I find the best ant based on that
2011-12-08T13:32:14  <thestinger> 'best ant' meaning enemy with the lowest weakness
2011-12-08T13:32:21  <thestinger> just like running a combat evaluation
2011-12-08T13:32:56  <besh> yes that second statement makes sense.
2011-12-08T13:33:24  <thestinger> I don't really think I interpreted what he said in the right way

2011-12-08T13:33:59  <thestinger> fighting[row][col][player] is the number of enemies (of that player) within attackradius+1
2011-12-08T13:34:09  <thestinger> besh: yeah, I do that with the fighting data later
2011-12-08T13:34:19  <thestinger> so after I calculate all that stuff
2011-12-08T13:34:22  <thestinger> I go through each tile
2011-12-08T13:34:42  <thestinger> I get the fighting value of that tile (for player 0)
2011-12-08T13:34:52  <thestinger> then I look at the tiles around it (within attackradius+1)
2011-12-08T13:35:16  <thestinger> if there's an enemy ant, I check the value for it (# of enemies it has)
2011-12-08T13:35:43  *** dr- <dr-!~dr-@ble59-1-82-66-133-150.fbx.proxad.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
2011-12-08T13:35:52  <thestinger> then I compare to the value I got for the tile I'm checking - it's equal, I mark it KILL - if it's greater, I mark it DIE and break out of the loop
2011-12-08T13:36:55  <besh> Ok thanks it is getting clearer now.
2011-12-08T13:37:03  <thestinger> well, that's how I interpreted it
2011-12-08T13:37:14  <thestinger> I think my interpretation must be wrong because this doesn't seem very useful :P
2011-12-08T13:37:42  <besh> haha... it must be because his bot is very strong ;)
2011-12-08T13:38:47  <besh> My combat scheme which I think a lot other use is simple
2011-12-08T13:39:01  <besh> I just park my ants on attack_radius + 2 of enemy ants
2011-12-08T13:39:13  <besh> then attack when I outnumber the enemy ant
2011-12-08T13:39:31  <thestinger> so does it work if there's 1 enemy
2011-12-08T13:39:38  <thestinger> and you have 1 ant on opposite sides?
2011-12-08T13:40:19  <thestinger> meh, maybe I'll try the debug visualizer and take a screen of this crap :P
2011-12-08T13:43:43  <BenJackson> wow I played a burst of games
2011-12-08T13:43:56  <BenJackson> 5 between 3:16am and 3:23am
2011-12-08T13:44:09  <BenJackson> previous gap was about 24h
2011-12-08T13:44:19  <BenJackson> net skill change was -0.05
2011-12-08T13:44:41  <besh> yes it works well but sometimes can suicide.
2011-12-08T13:44:55  <besh> A little correction there. I park them at attack_radius + 1
2011-12-08T13:45:04  <besh> and also attack_radius + 2
2011-12-08T13:45:36  <besh> In 2 vs 1 it can never loose but doesn't mean it can always win.
2011-12-08T13:46:22  <BenJackson> since my combat just maximizes certain heuristics I often don't understand what it does
2011-12-08T13:46:27  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-08T13:46:29  <thestinger> I think this works :D
2011-12-08T13:46:31  <BenJackson> or not without significant thought
2011-12-08T13:46:52  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vYm5jZw
2011-12-08T13:46:58  <thestinger> so that orange ant near the enemies
2011-12-08T13:47:05  <thestinger> if it moves down (into blue) it can trade 1 for 1
2011-12-08T13:47:06  <BenJackson> it will sort of suck if after seeing everyone implement the same strategy function and clump up in the ranks now everyone implements the same combat
2011-12-08T13:47:14  <thestinger> if it moves out of the red/blue ranges, it will be safe
2011-12-08T13:47:40  <pairofdice> Why is the blue only south
2011-12-08T13:47:53  <BenJackson> blue is trade
2011-12-08T13:47:56  <BenJackson> if it moves east it can escape
2011-12-08T13:48:42  <thestinger> yeah, this is somewhat different than what I do now
2011-12-08T13:48:46  <thestinger> I think I could easily mix them together
2011-12-08T13:48:54  <thestinger> but I don't think just doing it this way will work

2011-12-08T13:49:23  <thestinger> Fluxid: just look at the pic :P

2011-12-08T13:49:50  <thestinger> atm I come up with possible enemy locations
2011-12-08T13:49:59  <thestinger> a simple version is just unmoving enemies, and enemies moving towards me
2011-12-08T13:50:18  <thestinger> then I generate moves that optimize a "score" based on those enemy locations (I assume they will do the best thing, so I raise the minimum)
2011-12-08T13:50:27  <thestinger> so like a payoff matrix, but only for enemy moves

2011-12-08T13:51:51  <BenJackson> actually this combat is pretty much the exact inverse of what I do
2011-12-08T13:52:01  <BenJackson> this method looks at how enemies could possibly threaten you
2011-12-08T13:52:12  <BenJackson> and I look at how I could possibly threaten enemies
2011-12-08T13:52:50  <Fluxid> those ideas look neat bu i think i'll stick with what i do
2011-12-08T13:53:06  <antimatroid> thestinger: if you're only considering 1 set of moves from your opponents it's more like a decision matrix :P
2011-12-08T13:53:29  <thestinger> antimatroid: no, I consider n sets of enemy moves
2011-12-08T13:53:38  <thestinger> but I only test 1 set of moves against them and just keep optimizing it
2011-12-08T13:53:54  <thestinger> so it's like a payoff matrix but I don't actually keep it around
2011-12-08T13:54:14  <thestinger> anyway it doesn't work very well
2011-12-08T13:55:23  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=171150&user=2255
2011-12-08T13:55:37  <thestinger> you can see that it gets the basics okay, but it falls apart for big battles
2011-12-08T13:55:47  <BenJackson> which one is he?
2011-12-08T13:55:55  <thestinger> because I don't form lines
2011-12-08T13:55:55  <BenJackson> oh you mean YOU
2011-12-08T13:56:06  <thestinger> and I don't really try to flank the enemy, even when I outnumber them
2011-12-08T13:56:29  <thestinger> the lines that do form are just because my ants try to get around each other, but that's limited to ~3 tiles away
2011-12-08T13:56:32  <BenJackson> neither do I, although it happens as an emergent behavior
2011-12-08T13:57:00  <BenJackson> I used to use "step around" avoidance but it resulted in lines
2011-12-08T13:57:10  <BenJackson> it's neat to see the current code moves 3-abreast snakes through mazes and stuff
2011-12-08T13:57:40  <BenJackson> the other problem with 'stepping around' is that the ants that would step out of line would sometimes step right back in to be closer, followed by stepping out, etc
2011-12-08T13:57:51  <Minthos> I saw one bot whose ants were just a flowing mass, like liquid
2011-12-08T13:58:25  <antimatroid> thestinger: have you considered path finding to enemies not over friends to try and get them to surround the enemy?
2011-12-08T13:59:33  <antimatroid> or vice versa
2011-12-08T13:59:40  <antimatroid> from enemies to friends but not over friends
2011-12-08T13:59:57  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-08T14:00:06  <thestinger> I have a few attempts in branches atm
2011-12-08T14:00:19  <thestinger> such as pretending a layer thicker than 2 of my ants is not passable
2011-12-08T14:00:21  <antimatroid> i haven't touched my bot in a few days
2011-12-08T14:00:44  <antimatroid> been busy with other stuff, hopefully i have time again on the weekend, although i need to fix up the maze map gen before my bot again too
2011-12-08T14:00:54  <thestinger> my bot is basically fine until there's a big battle, where it will just form a ball instead of a line
2011-12-08T14:01:20  <antimatroid> because they're all either agressive or defensive?

2011-12-08T14:02:22  <thestinger> basically, I have efficient movement to a target
2011-12-08T14:02:42  <thestinger> so, they'll usually form a 3 or 4 width march towards it

2011-12-08T14:04:56  <thestinger> so... it doesn't work like this
2011-12-08T14:06:20  <thestinger> because the "best" enemy ant doesn't have any enemies within attackradius+1
2011-12-08T14:07:27  <antimatroid> lol, you're still using attackradius +1?
2011-12-08T14:07:30  <antimatroid> partition them properly!
2011-12-08T14:07:39  <thestinger> no
2011-12-08T14:07:45  <thestinger> this is to implement this http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=2083
2011-12-08T14:07:50  <thestinger> I'm trying to understand it
2011-12-08T14:08:21  <thestinger> I could just get attackradius with the ant moved in each possible direction
2011-12-08T14:08:33  <thestinger> but there's no point doing it properly if it's not going to work at all :P
2011-12-08T14:09:11  <antimatroid> hehe, that's a lot like what i do, except they missed a trick i'm using to get slightly more accurate info
2011-12-08T14:09:42  <antimatroid> i use that kind of information to pick out offensive and defensive moves for my opponents and i then put it through a game tree
2011-12-08T14:11:25  <UncleVasya> Offencive is where sum of  summes of distances every enemy to every your ant is minimal and defencive vise versa?
2011-12-08T14:16:01  <antimatroid> thestinger: http://pastebin.com/a0tstdX5
2011-12-08T14:16:08  <antimatroid> that's a hint towards improving the accuracy of your info
2011-12-08T14:16:18  <antimatroid> only 1 enemy can really battle a if he remains statis
2011-12-08T14:16:20  <antimatroid> static*
2011-12-08T14:17:15  <thestinger> well, I know a better way would be tiles within attackradius of the tile the enemy ant is in, and also the tiles they could move to
2011-12-08T14:18:01  <antimatroid> yeah, i just do min of those two numbers :P
2011-12-08T14:18:10  <antimatroid> unique locations battled from and unique enemies
2011-12-08T14:19:44  <antimatroid> you only need to work out this information for locations that can be moved into as well obviously
2011-12-08T14:21:05  <antimatroid> and my state stores for each location the locations that (i) could battle it if it doesn't move and it's enemies do(don't) (ii) could battle if it does(n't) and it's enemies do(don't) move
2011-12-08T14:21:50  <antimatroid> you can set them up with translation values in turn 0 then just update as you receive water info :P

2011-12-08T16:17:22  <Minthos> better than valgrind? blasphemy! :p
2011-12-08T16:17:23  <ikaros> any hint on how much time i should reserver for sending outputs? .. this seems to vary pretty much
2011-12-08T16:17:30  <thestinger> Minthos: much better, it's built into your program
2011-12-08T16:17:31  <ikaros> reserve*
2011-12-08T16:17:33  <thestinger> bounds checks for every array
2011-12-08T16:17:34  <BenJackson> it's 10ms per 100 lines
2011-12-08T16:17:41  <BenJackson> the engine enforces that
2011-12-08T16:17:49  <thestinger> int a[4]; a[5] = 5;
2011-12-08T16:17:53  <BenJackson> but you can send output early and be processing during the 10ms too
2011-12-08T16:17:53  <ikaros> hmm
2011-12-08T16:17:54  <thestinger> valgrind doesn't catch that, libmudflap does
2011-12-08T16:18:14  <thestinger> well valgrind might if it actually accesses off the end of the stack
2011-12-08T16:18:15  <ikaros> i buffered all outputs in a stringstream and send it completely at the end
2011-12-08T16:18:37  <BenJackson> not a good idea
2011-12-08T16:18:38  <thestinger> ikaros: the engine pauses for 10ms between every... 50 lines I think
2011-12-08T16:18:39  <thestinger> maybe 100 lines
2011-12-08T16:18:43  <thestinger> don't buffer it
2011-12-08T16:18:48  <BenJackson> if you know what you want to do, do it early if you have >100 bots
2011-12-08T16:18:56  <ikaros> hm ok i did that because i already had timeouts befor
2011-12-08T16:18:59  <ikaros> which was strange
2011-12-08T16:19:24  <ikaros> set turntime to 50ms and let 10% for output
2011-12-08T16:19:28  <thestinger> so my new combat code is different
2011-12-08T16:19:30  <ikaros> but it seemed to low
2011-12-08T16:19:30  <thestinger> not sure if it's better
2011-12-08T16:19:43  <thestinger> maybe I just have 1000 bugs to fix
2011-12-08T16:20:12  <Minthos> same here.. I fixed last night's bug today
2011-12-08T16:20:21  <Minthos> and made one ore more new ones
2011-12-08T16:20:32  <Minthos> so now my bot is mental again
2011-12-08T16:20:51  <Minthos> s/ore/or/
2011-12-08T16:21:02  <besh> I do the same thning as Ikaros. What is wrong with buffering ?
2011-12-08T16:21:14  <McLeopold> BenJackson: I had updated the status wrong.  And it's not really combat yet, just combat avoidance.
2011-12-08T16:22:00  <ikaros> keep getting timeouts.. even with 10ms reserved for output.. very strange
2011-12-08T16:22:07  <ikaros> and there are only 15 ants or so
2011-12-08T16:22:12  <ikaros> meaning 15 lines..
2011-12-08T16:22:19  <BenJackson> how is 15 ants taking 500ms anyway?
2011-12-08T16:22:21  <besh> thestinger: is it better to send each move as you get it ?
2011-12-08T16:22:23  <Minthos> buffering throws away computation time because the engine is slow at reading bot commands
2011-12-08T16:22:35  <thestinger> besh: I dunno, it doesn't matter for me
2011-12-08T16:22:39  <ikaros> BenJackson, i lowered turntime to 100ms
2011-12-08T16:22:48  <ikaros> and i test how many calculations i can do
2011-12-08T16:22:48  <thestinger> I output all moves near the end because I keep them around to change them with combat code
2011-12-08T16:22:56  <ikaros> thats why it uses 90% time for simulation
2011-12-08T16:23:00  <thestinger> but it would be better just to output them right away I guess
2011-12-08T16:23:19  <McLeopold> just before I timed out, I had the highest ant count \o/ http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.19470
2011-12-08T16:24:03  <BenJackson> wow I wonder if the "_15lookahead" guy is really etc
2011-12-08T16:24:28  <BenJackson> guess I've got to implement this new combat thing to see it in action
2011-12-08T16:24:29  <thestinger> no way

2011-12-08T16:25:23  <besh> Minthos: we are talking about writing your moves. Is it better to write each move one by one as you get it doing computation in between OR write them all at the end ?

2011-12-08T16:28:24  <BenJackson> is the live setup actually using --serial or some variant?

2011-12-08T16:28:48  <McLeopold> serial 2
2011-12-08T16:29:00  <McLeopold> serial is only for the engine, not playgame
2011-12-08T16:29:08  <McLeopold> the official contest doesn't use playgame
2011-12-08T16:29:13  <McLeopold> that is local play only
2011-12-08T16:29:14  <BenJackson> playgame does take it, ah
2011-12-08T16:29:20  <BenJackson> ok, cool
2011-12-08T16:29:32  <BenJackson> so maybe having CPU time controls vs wall clock is not that big a deal
2011-12-08T16:29:38  <McLeopold> I could added... or you could do a pull request
2011-12-08T16:29:39  <BenJackson> since it's not up to 9 bots waiting on the slowest

2011-12-08T16:31:48  <BenJackson> as long as your logic doesn't move ants off your hill
2011-12-08T16:32:08  <BenJackson> BUT your hills are only worth 1 point so you can probably still score higher if you bring more ants to the party
2011-12-08T16:32:13  <BenJackson> once your hill is surrounded you won't be able to

2011-12-08T16:33:55  <Fluxid> okay then!
2011-12-08T16:34:00  <Fluxid> KILL ALL THE GAMES
2011-12-08T16:34:07  <McLeopold> Fluxid: so, how about that turn time?
2011-12-08T16:34:36  <Fluxid> McLeopold: now it should send turntime 500
2011-12-08T16:34:40  <Fluxid> someone check
2011-12-08T16:34:48  <thestinger> it's fast now
2011-12-08T16:34:50  <thestinger> :)
2011-12-08T16:35:10  <thestinger> my cpu load is way up which is a good sign
2011-12-08T16:35:12  <BenJackson> mine won't be restarted until I get home
2011-12-08T16:35:34  <besh> yes it seems to go faster but i have to wait till a new game starts ..
2011-12-08T16:36:32  <besh> no it is still 5000
2011-12-08T16:37:40  <Fluxid> besh: you mean you get 5000 or you see 5000 in game replay on site
2011-12-08T16:38:00  <Fluxid> because it replaces turntime when sending to socket with 500
2011-12-08T16:38:05  <Fluxid> not in engine itself
2011-12-08T16:38:16  <Fluxid> at least it should
2011-12-08T16:38:20  <ikaros> wasnt there a problem with the timer from the c++ starter pack?
2011-12-08T16:38:30  <thestinger> ikaros: I think it was broken
2011-12-08T16:38:40  <ikaros> ok.. best ill look into that first :)
2011-12-08T16:39:06  <thestinger> the best way to do it is saving a timeval struct, and calculating a delta based on a new one
2011-12-08T16:39:31  <thestinger> instead of trying to turn unix time seconds into milli/microseconds
2011-12-08T16:39:59  <besh> fluxid: I see 5000 for both loadtime and turntime but the games to go much faster..
2011-12-08T16:40:17  <Fluxid> i'll check myself with my bot then
2011-12-08T16:40:43  <Fluxid> it's 500
2011-12-08T16:40:46  <g0llum> fluxid, what did you do to achieve the 500 output t the bots ?
2011-12-08T16:40:58  <Fluxid> g0llum: i'll commit and push in a second
2011-12-08T16:41:03  <thestinger> ikaros: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/z5jGMzQw7jxcJkOOYa4B/ I just turned it into that (you can ignore the silly anonymous namespace)

2011-12-08T16:41:33  <ikaros> thx i was just reading up clock_gettime .. no idea whats the better choice
2011-12-08T16:41:37  <LouisMartin> greeting gentlemen  :)
2011-12-08T16:41:56  <thestinger> ikaros: clock_gettime is the modern way (gettimeofday is deprecated according to the POSIX:2008 docs)

2011-12-08T16:42:05  <thestinger> but I think you need -lrt passed to gcc to use the clock_ stuff
2011-12-08T16:42:11  <Fluxid> g0llum: https://github.com/fluxid/ants-tcp/commit/4cdd4c7c293c46094271020b4b7f93858c2e62e3 here you are
2011-12-08T16:42:11  <ikaros> ohh
2011-12-08T16:42:19  <ikaros> ok thx i will try your version first
2011-12-08T16:42:57  <thestinger> the new clock_ stuff lets you use CLOCK_MONOTONIC (based on an arbitrary time) instead of wall clock time, which can be changed by ntpd, etc.
2011-12-08T16:43:17  <LouisMartin> as I'm about to begin the battle code for my post-nervous breakdown v2 bot, I was wondering if some of you would be kind enough to give me a few advices and tips? share some horror stories of what to avoid?
2011-12-08T16:43:26  <thestinger> and I think it's more accurate (the struct uses nsec, not usec :P) and you can get the resolution with clock_getres
2011-12-08T16:43:32  <thestinger> gettimeofday() is fine though

2011-12-08T16:45:35  <besh> fluxid: I am getting 5000 for the third time even after I restarted ? Replay also says 5000
2011-12-08T16:45:41  <LouisMartin> has anyone shared some scenarios maps to practice battle / battle aspect and such?   is there a map editor or any precious tool I should know about?
2011-12-08T16:46:43  <McLeopold> LouisMartin: notepad...
2011-12-08T16:47:13  <thestinger> I think there's an emacs mode for drawing ascii art...
2011-12-08T16:47:20  <BenJackson> to be 100% accurate:  clock_gettime CLOCK_MONOTONIC's *rate* is affected by NTP, but not its offset
2011-12-08T16:47:40  <BenJackson> but gettimeofday and clock_gettime use the same underlying mechanism
2011-12-08T16:47:45  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-08T16:47:48  <BenJackson> and linux actually stores the wall clock time and translates to monotonic
2011-12-08T16:47:56  <BenJackson> so gettimeofday is microscopically faster
2011-12-08T16:48:28  <McLeopold> oh wow, you drop all games when restarting?
2011-12-08T16:48:48  <LouisMartin> McLeopold:  Yea, I was thinking of TheDraw (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheDraw)

2011-12-08T16:49:41  <thestinger> anyway I'm just doing it by hand in vim :P
2011-12-08T16:50:37  <BenJackson> yeah, I have a template arena
2011-12-08T16:50:43  <BenJackson> and I modify it in vim
2011-12-08T16:50:54  <LouisMartin> thestinger: I like it
2011-12-08T16:51:36  <g0llum> fluxid, still got turntime 5000fluxid, it's not the bot, that writes turntime, but the angine/ants.py(1542) i think, you mixed up bot read/write
2011-12-08T16:52:13  <Fluxid> lemme check once more
2011-12-08T16:53:09  <LouisMartin> so, no maps/bots to practice battle code has been shared?
2011-12-08T16:53:30  <McLeopold> a few on paste
2011-12-08T16:53:42  <Fluxid> hm, you're right
2011-12-08T16:55:05  <thestinger> in vim, I just use block visual with ctrl-V and then r% to change to walls r. to change to land, etc.
2011-12-08T16:55:20  <thestinger> the emacs artist mode thing is kind of neat though

2011-12-08T17:08:30  <BenJackson> yeah that seems to be a big disparity for the finals

2011-12-08T17:08:39  <BenJackson> you and some other bot could play entirely disjoint sets of maps

2011-12-08T17:09:13  <BenJackson> an ant could hide in a niche such that only one enemy ant could threaten it

2011-12-08T17:09:32  <thestinger> this map I'm testing on is silly, my bots raise each other's hill at the same turn

2011-12-08T17:32:08  <besh> fluxid: I tried your idea about cost of path through ants for A* path finding, and it helps.
2011-12-08T17:32:51  <besh> I increment the cost by +2 when the path is through an ant. Maybe too aggresive ?
2011-12-08T17:33:17  <besh> I am wondering if I can manipulate the cost to include "unseen tile" information.
2011-12-08T17:33:50  <thestinger> besh: I do +3 when going through an ant instead of the usual +1
2011-12-08T17:34:09  <besh> Aha so we do similar things then.
2011-12-08T17:34:11  <thestinger> well, I've tried like a hundred variations
2011-12-08T17:34:40  <besh> It helps to avoid path through pile of your ants like at choke points.
2011-12-08T17:35:13  <thestinger> yeah, they take alternate routes if it's not too much further
2011-12-08T17:35:32  <thestinger> I need a better way of doing it though
2011-12-08T17:36:34  <besh> I am thinking to use it for maximizing exploration as well. To prefer paths through less visited tiles more but getting the right weights may be difficult.
2011-12-08T17:39:01  <besh> My A* paths are not really that optimal anyway. I use  weighted A* with a factor of 2

2011-12-08T17:50:56  <besh> but that water tile forces them to move to the same location for his example.

2011-12-08T18:21:36  <LouisMartin> btw, what would be the parameter  -So  ?   I blindly copy/pasted it for a while without knowing. It's not in the playgame.py usage
2011-12-08T18:22:28  <BenJackson> LouisMartin: bad line endings?
2011-12-08T18:22:45  <LouisMartin> tried it, but it doesn't work
2011-12-08T18:23:50  <LouisMartin> Ben: line endings?    I thought notepad was okay?
2011-12-08T18:24:10  <LouisMartin> cr/lf  versus just lf  ?
2011-12-08T18:25:07  <LouisMartin> I actually used Visual Studio to save it, not notepad
2011-12-08T18:28:45  <LouisMartin> ...and that is it: saving maps under common windows editors adds the <Cr> and playgame.py dislike those. I opened and <saved as> a perfectly working map and now it's ruined.
2011-12-08T18:29:18  <LouisMartin> thanks BenJackson and g0llum. mystery solved.

2011-12-08T18:34:09  <thestinger> windows also doesn't use UTF-8 everywhere
2011-12-08T18:34:25  <thestinger> and I think notepad/wordpad have broken unicode
2011-12-08T18:34:36  <BenJackson> you could probably fix the engine to load crlf maps pretty easily

2011-12-08T20:12:06  <BenJackson> so I took out almost all of my bot's motivations
2011-12-08T20:12:22  <BenJackson> it doesn't even go toward hills for the most part
2011-12-08T20:12:37  <BenJackson> it might step on one preferentially if it happens to be next to it
2011-12-08T20:12:50  <BenJackson> then I added a slight interest in enemy ants
2011-12-08T20:12:55  <BenJackson> now it's an ant extermination machine
2011-12-08T20:13:16  <BenJackson> finished this 4 player game with total vision of the map and 2 surviving enemies
2011-12-08T20:15:39  <besh> so it is more passive now ?

2011-12-08T20:16:48  <besh> well I need to add some motivation to my bot. Look at the end of the game here http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.19863
2011-12-08T20:16:56  <BenJackson> not really
2011-12-08T20:16:58  <BenJackson> just less focused
2011-12-08T20:17:44  <besh> I did the changes you made sometime back and it clearly improved strenght
2011-12-08T20:18:12  <BenJackson> the changes I made?
2011-12-08T20:18:18  <besh> viz a viz. Less attack hill , more exploration, and more enemy ant attacks
2011-12-08T20:18:38  <besh> Hill attack was taking too many ants
2011-12-08T20:18:51  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-12-08T20:19:10  <BenJackson> my current version will do some interesting collapsing on an enemy hill when it's discovered
2011-12-08T20:19:15  <BenJackson> which is great when it's the last
2011-12-08T20:19:17  <BenJackson> and sucks when it's not
2011-12-08T20:19:46  <besh> do you prioritize based on distance to targets ?
2011-12-08T20:20:24  <BenJackson> on all kinds of things, but yes
2011-12-08T20:20:29  <besh> For instance, when I find enemy hill with in 16 unit radius I go for it instead of attacking ants.
2011-12-08T20:21:14  <besh> Also I prefer to attack ants close to my hills with more priority
2011-12-08T20:21:20  <BenJackson> one bug that's fixed in V10 that I saw on aichallenge in V9 was where an ant that was NEXT TO an enemy hill ran off to get food
2011-12-08T20:21:23  <BenJackson> oops
2011-12-08T20:22:00  <besh> yes that could still happen for me
2011-12-08T20:22:10  <BenJackson> I basically rely on finding nearby hills first to set the priority
2011-12-08T20:22:17  <BenJackson> that's one reason I didn't use symmetry detection yet
2011-12-08T20:22:22  <BenJackson> I "find" far away hills too early
2011-12-08T20:22:48  <Anilm3> do the top bots use symmetry detection?
2011-12-08T20:23:07  <besh> But if you have reduced priority for hills, it may come handy
2011-12-08T20:24:19  <BenJackson> Anilm3: I haven't tried to figure it out
2011-12-08T20:24:24  <BenJackson> like I said, I don't, and I was as high as 5th

2011-12-08T20:25:01  <Anilm3> I don't even have a clue as to how that would be implemented
2011-12-08T20:25:40  <BenJackson> I had to read a lot of code
2011-12-08T20:25:44  <BenJackson> the map generators, the engine, etc
2011-12-08T20:27:10  <besh> sysmmetry detection can also be used to reduce path finding _theoretically_

2011-12-08T20:32:23  <Anilm3> I'm still trying to make my bot go a little bit more packed to raze hills and to avoid exploring dead ends
2011-12-08T20:33:23  <Anilm3> I don't even know where to start
2011-12-08T20:33:33  <besh> I try to flock my ants when they are outnumbered by enemy.
2011-12-08T20:34:08  <Anilm3> I see some of the top100 bots and they all go packed and don't get stuck
2011-12-08T20:34:18  <Anilm3> I don't see how they do it
2011-12-08T20:34:28  <thestinger> recursively changing moves
2011-12-08T20:34:45  <Anilm3> what?
2011-12-08T20:34:49  <Anilm3> :O
2011-12-08T20:35:00  <besh> Anilms3: the snake like movements are sideeffects of path finding
2011-12-08T20:35:24  <besh> the head of the snake moves leaving behind an empty space..and so on
2011-12-08T20:36:07  <besh> then when you see an enemy you change course to put maximum attack
2011-12-08T20:36:57  <Anilm3> but path finding usually needs a target doesn't it?
2011-12-08T20:37:24  <besh> yes.
2011-12-08T20:37:53  <Anilm3> In my case
2011-12-08T20:37:57  <Anilm3> when there is no target
2011-12-08T20:38:00  <Anilm3> ants roam freely
2011-12-08T20:38:34  <Anilm3> searching for food and ignoring enemies
2011-12-08T20:38:38  <besh> yes. But when you see a hill all move to one target
2011-12-08T20:38:48  <besh> And they can even flock without any additional code
2011-12-08T20:38:53  <Anilm3> but how can I do that?
2011-12-08T20:39:06  <besh> All ants converge to the same location

2011-12-08T20:39:43  <Anilm3> so if I see a hill I have to move a large number of ants towards it?
2011-12-08T20:39:50  <besh> For exploration (different targets) the ants disperse which is again the desired behaviour
2011-12-08T20:40:05  <besh> yes
2011-12-08T20:40:21  <Anilm3> but pathfinding from every ant to that same hill can be costly
2011-12-08T20:40:34  <BenJackson> jeez there's a lot of spam in the forums
2011-12-08T20:40:41  <BenJackson> I need a macro to report with fewer clicks
2011-12-08T20:40:43  <besh> As a beginner,  infact I moved all my ants
2011-12-08T20:40:59  <Anilm3> I tried that but my bot timed out
2011-12-08T20:41:15  <besh> have you tried bfs ?
2011-12-08T20:41:25  <Anilm3> I did A* from every ant to the target
2011-12-08T20:41:30  <besh> thestinger uses that if I am not mistaken
2011-12-08T20:41:51  <Anilm3> A*?
2011-12-08T20:42:27  <besh> It is more like diffusion without coordination. You generate a bfs table from the hill outwards and then, you ants move towards the hill by minizing distance
2011-12-08T20:43:22  <Anilm3> in order to move a subset of my ants
2011-12-08T20:43:40  <Anilm3> I see
2011-12-08T20:44:05  <besh> what language are you using ?
2011-12-08T20:44:12  <thestinger> besh: I add +3 instead of +1 when going through a tile with one of my ants though
2011-12-08T20:44:13  <Anilm3> c++
2011-12-08T20:44:20  <ikaros> you could sort them by distance so they wont be blocked or implement a "push" system
2011-12-08T20:44:44  <besh> Aha you do that to the bfs table too ?
2011-12-08T20:44:50  <besh> thestinger: ^
2011-12-08T20:45:18  <thestinger> yeah, makes ants spread out or take alternate routes (if they aren't much longer)
2011-12-08T20:45:25  <Anilm3> ikaros: by distance to the hill you mean?
2011-12-08T20:45:32  <ikaros> for example
2011-12-08T20:45:44  <ikaros> or to whatever target you are heading
2011-12-08T20:46:41  <ikaros> though all my bfs based exploration sucked but i guess thats just my fault
2011-12-08T20:47:47  <ikaros> either my ants jittered or the clumped together.. no good distribution :)
2011-12-08T20:48:23  <Anilm3> my exploration actually tends to separate ants too much
2011-12-08T20:48:27  <Anilm3> except on mazes
2011-12-08T20:48:29  <besh> ikaros: the ants do jitter but become straight when they see enemy
2011-12-08T20:48:34  <Anilm3> on mazes they get stuck
2011-12-08T20:48:54  <besh> The first ant to reach the target stops at attack_radius + 2
2011-12-08T20:49:39  <besh> i wouldn't worry about how they move before reaching the target really
2011-12-08T20:49:55  <ikaros> besh :)
2011-12-08T20:50:42  <ikaros> how do you guys decide which tile should be explored?
2011-12-08T20:50:59  <besh> To be honest, I was worried to and tried to make vertical/horizontal lines when i started :)
2011-12-08T20:51:01  <ikaros> i use an times_not_seen attribute but its not so good

2011-12-08T20:51:50  <ikaros> increasing a counter for each tile when i dont see it
2011-12-08T20:52:21  <Anilm3> something like that
2011-12-08T20:52:24  <ikaros> Anilm3, when i do that and set the period too short the run in circles
2011-12-08T20:52:34  <besh> ikaros: it is better to incrment a counter when you see the tile.
2011-12-08T20:52:44  <ikaros> hm
2011-12-08T20:52:45  <Anilm3> besh: that's how I do it yes
2011-12-08T20:52:52  <ikaros> i had that before
2011-12-08T20:52:54  <ikaros> why is it?
2011-12-08T20:53:06  <Anilm3> I don't increment viewrange
2011-12-08T20:53:13  <Anilm3> just a smaller range
2011-12-08T20:53:23  <Anilm3> arbitrarily picked (worked well)
2011-12-08T20:53:28  <besh> well when I tested the idea, I wanted to move my ant to the least visited tile.
2011-12-08T20:53:31  <ikaros> hm gotta try that
2011-12-08T20:53:56  <Anilm3> ikaros: my ants walk very well on random walks and on some cells
2011-12-08T20:54:03  <Anilm3> but on mazes they get stuck
2011-12-08T20:54:04  <ikaros> besh which is not visible?
2011-12-08T20:54:07  <ikaros> oh hehe
2011-12-08T20:54:39  <Anilm3> I have tried taking into account not only the tiles I haven't visited but the number of ants near that tile
2011-12-08T20:54:44  <Anilm3> but it gets worse somehow
2011-12-08T20:55:22  <ikaros> for mazes this hill climbing thing from the forums was great
2011-12-08T20:55:26  <besh> anilm3: number of enemy ants ?

2011-12-08T20:56:26  <ikaros> yea
2011-12-08T20:56:43  <Anilm3> today I tried some type of "learning"
2011-12-08T20:56:49  <ikaros> but the version is very old and still has the bug: if it discovered the whole map they go all back to base lol
2011-12-08T20:56:53  <Anilm3> but sucked
2011-12-08T20:57:32  <besh> ikaros: i refill unseen tiles when the whole map is visited.
2011-12-08T20:57:44  <ikaros> ok i tried that too
2011-12-08T20:57:49  <besh> I want to replace that with the visit_count array later when I have time
2011-12-08T20:58:04  <ikaros> but often ants went in lines into one direction..
2011-12-08T20:58:13  <ikaros> from the hive
2011-12-08T20:58:25  <besh> unfortunately they do
2011-12-08T20:58:26  <ikaros> and didnt distribute enough.. no idea what i do wrong there
2011-12-08T20:59:07  <besh> well i thought about adding some randomness to the closest tiles, instead of taking the single closest tile as target.
2011-12-08T21:00:00  <ikaros> i used a "ring" of targets as queue for my bfs

2011-12-08T22:35:00  <besh> The correct attack would be to move the top left two ants south, but keep the right one static
2011-12-08T22:35:16  <besh> Assuming static opponent ants. How to achieve this ?
2011-12-08T22:37:19  <LouisMartin> pay them?  ants love money :)
2011-12-08T22:38:34  <LouisMartin> I'm just beginning to develop my own battle system, so I'm afraid I can't afford way more than humor here
2011-12-08T22:38:36  <besh> they love sugar :) My combat moves all three ants down and I think it can help to improve this
2011-12-08T22:39:49  <besh> I wonder if the influence methods discussed would help here
2011-12-08T22:39:57  <LouisMartin> well, what about less sugar where your ant is sure to get killed without gain?
2011-12-08T22:41:37  <besh> The third ant will find no sugar by moving down, but two angry enemy attacks
2011-12-08T22:42:04  <besh> You are right, i should start thinking interms of sugar :)

2011-12-08T22:45:19  <thestinger> my old method was just to attack with everything
2011-12-08T22:45:22  <thestinger> then try cancelling orders
2011-12-08T22:45:31  <thestinger> which would result in the left two going down and the right one not going down
2011-12-08T22:45:36  <LouisMartin_> besh: sorry if I repeated this many times, but my computer is bugging tight and I don't know if I've resent this many times over.. strange bugs.. anyways ->
2011-12-08T22:45:38  <LouisMartin_> the implementation of this depends on how your system works, but a quick check such as "if I don't sacrifice this ant, is the outcome (gain) different?"  before moving wouldn't be costly I'd think
2011-12-08T22:46:39  <thestinger> going to bed now, cya
2011-12-08T22:47:09  <besh> what if there was another ant north of the 3rd ant. I mean redoing a move woud triger another undo
2011-12-08T22:47:19  <besh> undoing*
2011-12-08T22:47:29  <besh> ok cya

2011-12-08T23:12:41  <Antimony> Ug, I keep finding bugs in my symmetry code
2011-12-08T23:12:54  <Antimony> I've found at least 3 bugs in release versions
2011-12-08T23:13:10  <bmh> Antimony: you're doing symmetry? neat!
2011-12-08T23:13:45  <bmh> what 's your technique?
2011-12-08T23:14:50  <Antimony> what do you mean?
2011-12-08T23:15:58  <bmh> How are you solving it? How do you deal with rotation/mirroring?
2011-12-08T23:16:54  <Antimony> well for one thing, I assume rotation can only happen on square maps
2011-12-08T23:17:28  <bmh> that's a nice simplifying assumption
2011-12-08T23:18:12  <Antimony> anyway, I hope that it will give me a edge, but I haven't really noticed any benefits yet
2011-12-08T23:18:23  <Antimony> it wasn't as effective as I'd hoped
2011-12-08T23:18:56  <bmh> currently my ants blindly rush other ants
2011-12-08T23:19:01  <bmh> it's... suboptimal

2011-12-08T23:20:37  <Antimony> why would you rush other ants?
2011-12-08T23:21:15  <bmh> Antimony: because I have no fight code
2011-12-08T23:21:50  <Antimony> Anyway, the basic idea is to find all possible syemmtries and then each time you see a new square, remove the ones that don't fit. But unfortunately the method is a little slow
2011-12-08T23:22:48  <Antimony> Some times, my bot doesn't even get done processing the starting data before it finds the first hill
2011-12-08T23:22:55  <bmh> slow, really? :)
2011-12-08T23:22:58  <a1k0n> wow, the contest site is cruising now

2011-12-08T23:28:54  <Antimony> nah, I think my way is better even if it is slow
2011-12-08T23:29:15  <Antimony> and I do it at the end of turn after moves are calculated so at least it isn't hurting me
2011-12-08T23:29:36  <amstan> also... once you find your first hill it's really easy
2011-12-08T23:29:53  <amstan> the challenge is to do this before you find the hill, so you know where they are before the enemy has seen you
2011-12-08T23:30:07  <BenJackson> I keep "timing out" on fluxid
2011-12-08T23:30:20  <BenJackson> time taken: 185.627ms
2011-12-08T23:30:22  <amstan> BenJackson: turn off those torrents, lol
2011-12-08T23:30:45  <BenJackson> my ping to fluxid.pl is about 200ms
2011-12-08T23:31:19  <BenJackson> some packet loss in mid europe
2011-12-08T23:31:27  <_flag> BenJackson: fluxid times me out all the time too
2011-12-08T23:31:43  <_flag> That server is kind of known for its problems, I think there may just be a ton of people using it
2011-12-08T23:32:36  <BenJackson> this bot has most of the logic removed, too
2011-12-08T23:32:42  <BenJackson> so I was worried if it *really* timed uot!
2011-12-08T23:33:06  <bmh> my server isn't very beefy, but you could run your real bot there?
2011-12-08T23:33:19  <BenJackson> in 20 games the worst turn was 310ms
2011-12-08T23:33:48  <BenJackson> bmh: you want me to run my current contest bot on your server?
2011-12-08T23:34:17  <bmh> BenJackson: go for it. If fluxid is overrun, I have no qualms with 'production' bots running
2011-12-08T23:34:26  <BenJackson> oh, no
2011-12-08T23:34:29  <Antimony> my bot can generally only find hills before seeing them on a 2 player map
2011-12-08T23:34:35  <BenJackson> I just did 20 runs with some modified logic to see what it did
2011-12-08T23:34:43  <Antimony> because you usally have to explore almost half the map before you can be sure
2011-12-08T23:34:49  <BenJackson> I just wanted to see what it did with most of the "rules" removed
2011-12-08T23:34:53  <BenJackson> to see which rules are worth putting back
2011-12-08T23:35:02  <bmh> BenJackson: there is one game with bj_v4 v. skynet. Skynet should have won, but I turned off my laptop and went to bed :)
2011-12-08T23:35:14  <BenJackson> Antimony: you guys are going to kick yourselves at the end ;-)
