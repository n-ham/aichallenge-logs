2011-10-20T00:00:16  <mleise> Is there no "checkout all submodules" in the build script?
2011-10-20T00:00:22  <janzert> ahh, git repo doesn't have the submodules inited yet
2011-10-20T00:00:34  <janzert> nope, not automatically
2011-10-20T00:01:49  <mleise> janzert: is that new server a http server?
2011-10-20T00:02:13  <janzert> an http server?
2011-10-20T00:02:14  <mleise> a "manager" or whatever you call them?
2011-10-20T00:02:19  <janzert> yes

2011-10-20T00:11:55  <janzert> there is a Clojure bot in the git repo, I'm not sure it is complete though

2011-10-20T00:16:28  <janzert> one thing I would recommend is not to get too commited to any one technique right at the start of the contest but keep your mind opening to changing your approach for a while as you get some experience in how your bot is working out
2011-10-20T00:17:02  <djr_> hm
2011-10-20T00:17:18  <rockzombie2> quick question, it sounds dumb (and it is kinda dumb) but how can you "look" in your visible area around the ant and find food, or enemies? because so far I just know how to check to see if the space is unoccupied and passable
2011-10-20T00:18:14  *** mindeavor <mindeavor!~mindeavor@cpe-72-177-95-93.austin.res.rr.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-20T00:18:16  <janzert> not sure if this is what you mean but the engine will automatically send you the information on everything you can see

2011-10-20T00:18:37  <janzert> for ants, food and hills it sends that information every turn, for water just on the first turn you see it
2011-10-20T00:20:02  <UncleVasya> djr_: I did previous one and I think have some experience to help you in general.
2011-10-20T00:20:10  <janzert> working through the tutorial might help explain how your bot can handle that information
2011-10-20T00:20:39  <rockzombie2> so in C# at least, there is a Tile array called map, but the thing is it's private. so how am i supposed to check where the food is?

2011-10-20T00:21:07  <rockzombie2> oh i see it
2011-10-20T00:21:09  <UncleVasya> 1. Do version control. Even without special tools, you can just archive every version you uploading to the site.
2011-10-20T00:21:17  <janzert> great :)

2011-10-20T00:22:01  <janzert> it's set up for python and java at the moment but hopefully it will explain the same approach used in the C# bot
2011-10-20T00:22:05  <UncleVasya> 2. Do not hardcode any numbers (like attack radius, view radius). It can be changed. Last contest many guys got their bots crashed when max amout of planets changed.
2011-10-20T00:22:17  <djr_> yes i was actually looking up information on git right now
2011-10-20T00:22:23  <djr_> i haven't worked with version control much
2011-10-20T00:22:48  <djr_> and i am aware of the hardcoding numbers issue
2011-10-20T00:23:22  <UncleVasya> Me too, I just store zip archives like MyBot_10.zip, MyBot_18.zip
2011-10-20T00:24:08  <rockzombie2> also what time zone is the time to start the contest? because it's the 20th where I'm from
2011-10-20T00:24:33  <janzert> @tutoral

2011-10-20T00:26:35  <UncleVasya> 3. Sometime you have a good idea but you need a lot of time to implement it. And you think 'for now I'll do it in another, simplier way and later will rewrite this function'. Don't even try, do in the good way from the beginning.

2011-10-20T01:19:03  <a1k0n> nice.  one of the spawn locations is stuck in a wall in http://213.88.39.97:2080/map/multi_maze_02.map
2011-10-20T01:19:43  <janzert> a1k0n: all the disabled maps at the bottom of http://antsbeta.janzert.com/maps.php have that issue
2011-10-20T01:20:00  <janzert> the map generator now has a fix to prevent it of course
2011-10-20T01:20:03  <a1k0n> is there a connected-components check on the map generator now?
2011-10-20T01:20:38  <janzert> the problem was that it didn't have a check that it was placing the hill on land and not water
2011-10-20T01:20:58  <a1k0n> i love the map stats page
2011-10-20T01:21:18  <McLeopold> a1k0n: we have a lot of checks written, but not fully implemented yet
2011-10-20T01:21:19  <janzert> it's fun to go through
2011-10-20T01:21:24  <a1k0n> nice.  but is that enough?  a map generator could theoretically isolate land from everything
2011-10-20T01:21:40  <janzert> yeah, it could
2011-10-20T01:21:50  <a1k0n> (that could be considered a feature, unless only one player has a hill on it)
2011-10-20T01:21:57  <janzert> I don't think any of the current ones can though
2011-10-20T01:22:00  <McLeopold> I'm checking that 66% is traversable by a 3x3 block, that 100% is traversable by an ant
2011-10-20T01:22:14  <janzert> there are multiple generators for the different map types btw
2011-10-20T01:22:35  <McLeopold> they'll all be run through the master at some point, to do all the checks
2011-10-20T01:23:35  <jonathanasdf> How many people would be interested in an ActionScript 3 starter pack? I'm considering trying to whip one up but not sure if it'll be worth the effort
2011-10-20T01:24:28  <a1k0n> how does one run actionscript3 on the command line?
2011-10-20T01:24:37  <jonathanasdf> redtamarin
2011-10-20T01:24:49  <loverl> I don't know about ActionScript, but Erlang would be pretty nice.
2011-10-20T01:24:53  <a1k0n> ah.
2011-10-20T01:25:07  <jonathanasdf> Erlang probably is supported because I saw someone with Erlang on the scoreboards...
2011-10-20T01:25:50  <loverl> I didn't see a link for one on the Starter Packages page.
2011-10-20T01:25:57  <a1k0n> erlang seems like an odd choice compared to, i dunno, ocaml or haskell for this
2011-10-20T01:26:14  <jonathanasdf> http://aichallenge.org/language_profile.php?language=Erlang
2011-10-20T01:26:41  <loverl> http://aichallenge.org/starter_packages.php
2011-10-20T01:27:02  <a1k0n> yeah just because there's no starter package doesn't mean it's unsupported
2011-10-20T01:27:03  <janzert> loverl: there are several languages there that are supported but don't have a starter package
2011-10-20T01:27:21  <a1k0n> in the end, you just need to take a certain input on stdin and output something on stdout
2011-10-20T01:27:27  <jonathanasdf> yeah
2011-10-20T01:27:32  <a1k0n> and the building magic has to support it
2011-10-20T01:27:50  <loverl> Ah, okay then.  So if I whip up my own stuff, I'd be fine then.
2011-10-20T01:28:07  <jonathanasdf> well you can't use some language that they can't run
2011-10-20T01:28:17  <loverl> right, but for Erlang
2011-10-20T01:28:21  <jonathanasdf> yep
2011-10-20T01:28:41  <McLeopold> jonathanasdf: we would first need instructions on how to install it on ubuntu
2011-10-20T01:29:11  <loverl> that wouldn't take much.
2011-10-20T01:29:29  <jonathanasdf> if it's regarding redtamarin I haven't tried installing it on my side either
2011-10-20T01:29:39  <jonathanasdf> just gauging interest
2011-10-20T01:30:23  <jonathanasdf> because I have a few friends who don't know any other languages and doesn't want to learn any other languages but wants to compete... lol
2011-10-20T01:31:00  <loverl> Well, maybe I'll do something with erlang after I finish a shortest path algorithm and and a few other checks here and there..
2011-10-20T01:31:15  <loverl> Or perl.
2011-10-20T01:32:04  <loverl> Perl seems more tempting because I'd be less that I have to write myself.
2011-10-20T01:32:41  <jonathanasdf> I'm not that familiar with perl but isn't it kinda hard to make it OO?
2011-10-20T01:33:31  <jonathanasdf> and it's not a functional language either
2011-10-20T01:35:43  <loverl> I'm not sure.  I'm learning it now because I'm going into system administration.  I guess I'd be doing it because not many people would.  Same thing with Erlang.
2011-10-20T01:36:29  <jonathanasdf> doesn't seem like a great reason for doing so :P
2011-10-20T01:36:44  <jonathanasdf> sounds almost like you don't want to get top100

2011-10-20T02:08:49  <_flag> Perhaps you should add a feature that allows people to disable their bots if they don't want to be ranked atm, which allows for the conservation of resources?

2011-10-20T02:09:20  <janzert> that would be a nice feature, but I doubt many would use it
2011-10-20T02:09:29  <_flag> You can encourage people to use it
2011-10-20T02:10:08  <_flag> Just leave a message saying, "If you do not wish to be ranked atm, you may disable your bot temporairly to allow others to play more games. This will not affect your entry into the contest."
2011-10-20T02:10:26  <janzert> there has been talk of automatically disabling a submission after some time period unless the owner takes an action to keep it going
2011-10-20T02:10:26  <_flag> So if I upload a buggy version, I can disable it until I fix the issue
2011-10-20T02:10:38  <janzert> e.g. clicks a button in his profile
2011-10-20T02:10:50  <_flag> Hmm... that could work
2011-10-20T02:11:06  <_flag> How about a combination of that and if it's a top bot it keeps going automatically?
2011-10-20T02:11:17  <janzert> but of course none of these ideas have been actually coded so...

2011-10-20T02:23:11  <jonathanasdf> janzert: I'm following http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial.php and at the end of the Create Test Script step it says "A browser should have launched to show you the game in the visualizer." but I don't see that happening :\
2011-10-20T02:23:35  <McLeopold> jonathanasdf: what is happening?
2011-10-20T02:23:50  <jonathanasdf> just the table output
2011-10-20T02:23:56  <McLeopold> do you see errors?
2011-10-20T02:23:58  <jonathanasdf> the visualizer.jar doesn't auto-open
2011-10-20T02:23:59  <jonathanasdf> no errors
2011-10-20T02:24:21  <jonathanasdf> if I manually change tutorial.sh to pipe to the visualizer then it's fine
2011-10-20T02:24:25  <jonathanasdf> but according to that tutorial it's supposed to automatically open even if I don't do that

2011-10-20T02:30:45  <McLeopold> why cygwin?
2011-10-20T02:31:05  <jonathanasdf> because
2011-10-20T02:31:06  <jonathanasdf> lol
2011-10-20T02:31:14  <jonathanasdf> why not cygwin? it's worked fine for me for everything else
2011-10-20T02:31:16  <janzert> changing it to pipe the output might be the easiest
2011-10-20T02:31:45  <jonathanasdf> well i'm going to mess around a bit with playgame and visualizer..

2011-10-20T02:36:23  <McLeopold> janzert: export BROWSER=~/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe
2011-10-20T02:36:26  <McLeopold> jonathanasdf: ^^
2011-10-20T02:36:36  <McLeopold> put that in .profile
2011-10-20T02:39:02  <McLeopold> jonathanasdf: but, its attempting to launch outside the cygwin environment, so can't find the file
2011-10-20T02:39:24  <jonathanasdf> BROWSER just runs the file right?
2011-10-20T02:39:28  <jonathanasdf> so it could point to a script?
2011-10-20T02:39:36  <jonathanasdf> so I can just have a script that opens the browser outside of cygwin
2011-10-20T02:39:47  <McLeopold> the webbrowser module checks that for a valid webbrowser executable
2011-10-20T02:40:08  <McLeopold> this is what I get though file:///cygdrive/c/Users/Scott/git/aichallenge/ants/game_logs/replay.0.html
2011-10-20T02:40:32  <McLeopold> so, I think I would need a junction at cygdrive/c pointing to the root
2011-10-20T02:42:15  <jonathanasdf> ok good point, the brwoser can't open cygdrive paths
2011-10-20T02:42:30  <jonathanasdf> but can't I just sed it or something lol

2011-10-20T02:43:21  <jonathanasdf> to that bad link
2011-10-20T02:43:25  <jonathanasdf> so it's still not calling the browser
2011-10-20T02:43:33  <McLeopold> using chrome?
2011-10-20T02:43:35  <jonathanasdf> I have $BROWSER pointing to the firefox.exe
2011-10-20T02:43:42  <jonathanasdf> should I be using chrome? lol

2011-10-20T06:15:14  <antimatroid> i am curious of your results if you do test it :P
2011-10-20T06:15:21  <antimatroid> not the exact numbers, just whether there's a difference
2011-10-20T06:15:37  <mcstar> im not there yet, writing my bot from scratch
2011-10-20T06:15:46  <mcstar> i just wanted to see your file-structure
2011-10-20T06:16:00  <antimatroid> yeah, just write a file that outputs like 10000 lines and compare with or without it
2011-10-20T06:16:26  <mcstar> k, maybe i will test it, later
2011-10-20T06:16:38  <antimatroid> i found it nice to add a vector of neighbour locations to each square and update it so i could treat it like a graph
2011-10-20T06:16:50  <antimatroid> that way with path finding you aren't constantly calculating adjacent locations
2011-10-20T06:16:57  <antimatroid> and you never worry about searching onto water
2011-10-20T06:17:06  <antimatroid> i didn't do that with the starter bot though
2011-10-20T06:17:35  <antimatroid> i can't remember if i squared the euclidean metric in the starter bot either? but i don't know why anyone wouldn't
2011-10-20T06:17:40  <mcstar> is it faster than checking nn's?
2011-10-20T06:17:50  <antimatroid> nn?
2011-10-20T06:17:59  <mcstar> nearest neigbors

2011-10-20T06:18:28  <antimatroid> normally with path finding you get to a square and have to calculate all the neighbours right? you can just store a vector of non-water neighbours and grab the locations from that
2011-10-20T06:18:46  <antimatroid> and update the vectors as you get water information
2011-10-20T06:18:46  <mcstar> you have to traverse that vector too
2011-10-20T06:19:10  <antimatroid> yes, but you don't have to calculate the 4 adjacent locations (and check if they're water) for every square you search
2011-10-20T06:19:17  <antimatroid> and every time you search it
2011-10-20T06:19:18  <mcstar> calculating the positions of 4 nbors isnt much
2011-10-20T06:19:28  <mcstar> even so, if the compiler uses sse optimization
2011-10-20T06:19:30  <antimatroid> i optimise all the things
2011-10-20T06:19:49  <antimatroid> plus i think it's nicer anyway
2011-10-20T06:20:00  <antimatroid> once you set it up anyway
2011-10-20T06:20:16  <mcstar> no, i can see why you do it that way
2011-10-20T06:20:20  <antimatroid> you don't have to worry about checking for water all over the place or getting a vector of locations, just indexing a pre-existing one

2011-10-20T06:21:27  <antimatroid> I also had a grid struct for my actual bot rather than just having a 2d vector of squares called grid in state
2011-10-20T06:21:47  <mcstar> im thinking i will go with a full board-based approach, c++ will handle it nicely i think
2011-10-20T06:22:29  <mcstar> lol, 2d vector?

2011-10-20T06:23:40  <mcstar> i did a double indexable array
2011-10-20T06:23:49  <lrh9_> I'm using the Python starter kit. The 'ready' return value the specification refers to is is None, correct?
2011-10-20T06:23:54  <antimatroid> you can overload [] on a grid struct so you can still index it grid[r][c]
2011-10-20T06:24:06  <Posterdati> mcstar: is it a documentation on how to write a bot?
2011-10-20T06:24:10  <antimatroid> just return a reference to a vector of squares
2011-10-20T06:24:11  <mcstar> so the parameter is a int?
2011-10-20T06:24:21  <antimatroid> yeah, hang on

2011-10-20T06:25:09  <mcstar> what is?
2011-10-20T06:25:11  <antimatroid> mcstar: inline Square& operator[](const Location &loc) const
2011-10-20T06:25:28  <antimatroid> that's my index operator, so i can just index grid[loc] rather than grid[loc.row][loc.col]
2011-10-20T06:25:34  <mcstar> but location is a pair?
2011-10-20T06:25:40  <antimatroid> location is a struct
2011-10-20T06:25:53  <mcstar> oh
2011-10-20T06:25:54  <antimatroid> which contains 2 integers, one for row and another for col
2011-10-20T06:25:58  <mcstar> that hides the indices

2011-10-20T06:26:05  <antimatroid> then neighbours would be a vector of Locations etc.

2011-10-20T06:27:59  <mcstar> antimatroid: i had it in xclip
2011-10-20T06:27:59  <antimatroid> the engine will run your bot as a child process and feed input to it and read output back

2011-10-20T06:35:28  <mcstar> so you build on the vector stl
2011-10-20T06:35:32  <antimatroid> some of them just make life easier

2011-10-20T06:35:47  <mcstar> turns out, mine is no fast
2011-10-20T06:35:52  <antimatroid> not sure, works fine for me
2011-10-20T06:35:57  <mcstar> mathematica is 3x faster
2011-10-20T06:36:09  <antimatroid> in a .cc file i still include the std namespace so i don't need std:: everywhere
2011-10-20T06:36:17  <antimatroid> but i've been told i shouldn't do that in a library .h file
2011-10-20T06:36:27  <mcstar> can you set up a 300x300 double prec matrix multtiplication? run 10 times?
2011-10-20T06:36:39  <mcstar> that doesnt matter
2011-10-20T06:36:49  <mcstar> it disappears after compilation
2011-10-20T06:38:22  <mcstar> i cant stand this:

2011-10-20T06:38:54  <antimatroid> yeah the only time i ever need to use a * in c++ is for trees
2011-10-20T06:38:54  <mcstar> int &c
2011-10-20T06:39:01  <antimatroid> and even then i'm not convinced it's not me being silly
2011-10-20T06:39:09  <mcstar> i mean i prefer int* a;
2011-10-20T06:39:12  <mcstar> or int& a;
2011-10-20T06:39:18  <antimatroid> oh, meh
2011-10-20T06:39:22  <antimatroid> i agree
2011-10-20T06:39:28  <antimatroid> but yeah
2011-10-20T06:39:40  <antimatroid> i prefer to distinguish the type in the name
2011-10-20T06:39:47  <antimatroid> but i'm so used to it i forget
2011-10-20T06:40:58  <mcstar> i told my mathematician friend to write a bogosort
2011-10-20T06:41:03  <mcstar> poor guy did this:
2011-10-20T06:41:29  <mcstar> while(for(;;){something;} == 0){some other thing;}
2011-10-20T06:42:07  <mcstar> and he attended a c++ course at uni.
2011-10-20T06:42:38  <antimatroid> we got a 1 day crash course at the start of advanced algorithms
2011-10-20T06:42:43  <antimatroid> but we'd used c in another class
2011-10-20T06:43:11  <antimatroid> i've picked most of it up on a need to know basis though
2011-10-20T06:43:12  <mcstar> i think in our uni, you can learn jackshit on programming classes
2011-10-20T06:43:19  <mcstar> cant*
2011-10-20T06:43:31  <antimatroid> yeah the computing department at my uni is dreadful
2011-10-20T06:43:31  <mcstar> yeah me too
2011-10-20T06:43:48  <mcstar> i forgot a return
2011-10-20T06:44:00  <mcstar> while(for(;;){something; if() return 0;} == 0){some other thing;}
2011-10-20T06:44:10  <mcstar> so "logically" he was correct
2011-10-20T06:44:25  <mcstar> but c/c++ doesnt allow your logic to manifest
2011-10-20T06:45:47  <antimatroid> c++ would be perfect if it was just a little bit more flexible

2011-10-20T07:44:08  <antimatroid> Posterdati: you might not be able to win but you can certainly compete
2011-10-20T07:44:27  <mcstar> if you submit a bot, wheather you like it or not you are competing
2011-10-20T07:44:28  <antimatroid> we have made sure the game is simple enough that beginner programmers can actually learn while writing a bot

2011-10-20T07:44:46  <antimatroid> while the game has enough depth that more serious competitors have room to work on strategies
2011-10-20T07:44:51  <Posterdati> antimatroid: what is the purpose to compete without win?
2011-10-20T07:44:57  <antimatroid> to have fun!
2011-10-20T07:45:01  <mcstar> like a true klingon
2011-10-20T07:45:11  <Posterdati> lol
2011-10-20T07:45:14  <antimatroid> it's really cool watching a bot you wrote play against bots other people wrote
2011-10-20T07:45:15  <mcstar> if it's not for the win, why keep score?
2011-10-20T07:45:27  <Posterdati> I could have fun having sex not programming a bot!
2011-10-20T07:45:28  <Posterdati> :)
2011-10-20T07:45:32  <antimatroid> you could aim to do better than other beginners for example
2011-10-20T07:45:42  <antimatroid> i'm not saying results are irrelevant, just that it's not the only reason to compete
2011-10-20T07:45:55  <mcstar> Posterdati: well, if you can you should, unfortunately i cant
2011-10-20T07:46:26  <Posterdati> mcstar: me too, was a joke :)
2011-10-20T07:46:30  <antimatroid> Posterdati: my friend and i wrote a bot for tron when we were completely new to ai and it would have come in around 10th if it wasn't for the stupid timeout rules at the time
2011-10-20T07:46:45  <antimatroid> imo tron was a simpler game than planet wars or ants though
2011-10-20T07:47:38  <Posterdati> antimatroid: wow!
2011-10-20T07:47:47  <Posterdati> antimatroid: did you win?
2011-10-20T07:48:21  <mcstar> and the matchmaking is so, that there IS an ordering of the submitted bots, so even if you dont Win, you have still beaten all the players below your rank
2011-10-20T07:48:24  <antimatroid> no, we got disqualified when we were sitting around 10th cause we timed out
2011-10-20T07:48:25  <antimatroid> http://www.sifflez.org/misc/tronbot/index.html
2011-10-20T07:48:37  <antimatroid> our bot was based off that tutorial, although more clever
2011-10-20T07:49:09  <antimatroid> we had a pretty good state evaluation function and recycled relevant parts of hte tree between turns
2011-10-20T07:50:07  <antimatroid> to get anything useful out of game trees for planet wars or ants requires a lot more effort though due to the ridiculously large state spaces
2011-10-20T07:50:22  <antimatroid> you're much better off starting out with heursistics and path finding
2011-10-20T07:50:43  <mcstar> not just that, the whole game is more random
2011-10-20T07:50:54  <antimatroid> random?
2011-10-20T07:51:05  <antimatroid> i hate everything about random in ai games
2011-10-20T07:51:15  <mcstar> yeah, basically the state space if influenced by the position of food/water/hills
2011-10-20T07:51:18  <antimatroid> well, unfair random
2011-10-20T07:51:27  <antimatroid> yeah but that's all somewhat symmetric
2011-10-20T07:51:40  <antimatroid> at least from starting positions
2011-10-20T07:51:53  <mcstar> yeah, but the structure is much more complicated
2011-10-20T07:52:12  <antimatroid> yeah, tron was read a board and output which direction to move
2011-10-20T07:52:12  <mcstar> in PW you did have that many degrees of freedom
2011-10-20T07:52:17  <danielha_> uh, where do I get the code to run two agents against each other locally?
2011-10-20T07:52:27  <antimatroid> danielha_: starter packages
2011-10-20T07:52:45  <danielha_> antimatroid: I don't see it in Ruby?
2011-10-20T07:53:00  <mcstar> ants/dist/starter_packages?
2011-10-20T07:53:09  <mcstar> i think theres a ruby one
2011-10-20T07:53:11  <mcstar> i saw it
2011-10-20T07:53:36  <danielha_> there is a ruby starter package, which I got
2011-10-20T07:53:49  <danielha_> I'm wondering if I can do a local match between 2 of my own agents, before uploading
2011-10-20T07:53:57  <antimatroid> hmm, you need the tools
2011-10-20T07:54:08  <antimatroid> the cpp starter just downloads a zipped copy of that bot too
2011-10-20T07:54:21  <antimatroid> danielha_: you can of course do that, you just need to get a copy of the tools
2011-10-20T07:54:29  <antimatroid> mcstar: what's the easiest place to get them?
2011-10-20T07:54:36  <antimatroid> i haven't really seen what's happened lately
2011-10-20T07:54:37  <mcstar> always git
2011-10-20T07:54:51  <antimatroid> danielha_: http://aichallenge.org/using_the_tools.php see that page

2011-10-20T07:55:31  <antimatroid> np
2011-10-20T07:55:55  <mcstar> btw, i people should be disqualified for asking such questions, before exploring the site more thoroughly dont yuo agree?
2011-10-20T07:55:55  <antimatroid> mcstar: once we launch it's probably better to direct people to the actual site :P
2011-10-20T07:56:06  <mcstar> i think*
2011-10-20T07:56:12  <antimatroid> no, i ask such questions all the time :P
2011-10-20T07:56:22  <antimatroid> why look something up when it's quicker to ask someone else?
2011-10-20T07:56:35  <mcstar> i highly disagree
2011-10-20T07:56:47  <mcstar> i'd be a bad teacher
2011-10-20T07:56:57  <antimatroid> if i think there'd be a significant time difference i'll tend to ask
2011-10-20T07:57:12  <antimatroid> and there's a fair bit of information to ingest for the contest stuff when you first come across it
2011-10-20T07:57:36  <delt0r> wibble
2011-10-20T07:57:42  <mcstar> but soo much was added since i came here first
2011-10-20T07:57:48  <delt0r> man i totally don't feel like doing work today
2011-10-20T07:57:53  <mcstar> there are all sorts of tutorials, descriptions
2011-10-20T07:58:40  <delt0r> mcstar: you are right of course... but no one reads the site properly
2011-10-20T07:58:49  <mcstar> delt0r: than please, take job of answering helpdesk questions
2011-10-20T07:58:56  <mcstar> take the*
2011-10-20T07:58:59  <danielha_> with due respect, I did search. the only link I see now is in the 5 minute quickstart guide. I expected to see that in FAQs
2011-10-20T07:59:13  <mcstar> danielha_: dont take this personally
2011-10-20T07:59:24  <delt0r> sometimes people try... i am sure we have all had times when we look everywhere --don't find the answer then ask and it was right there in front of us the whole time
2011-10-20T07:59:42  <mcstar> "where is my beer?"
2011-10-20T07:59:50  <delt0r> at the bar
2011-10-20T07:59:57  <mcstar> yeah, that happens
2011-10-20T08:00:04  <danielha_> it's happened debugging too. so saying someone should be disqualified when you've already nerd-sniped me... well, how aren't I to take it personally?
2011-10-20T08:00:21  <delt0r> easily?
2011-10-20T08:00:30  <delt0r> sorry in a funny mood today
2011-10-20T08:00:46  <danielha_> and we wonder why there aren't more women hackers? christ
2011-10-20T08:00:56  <mcstar> people should say sorry if they are NOT in a funny mood, no the other way around
2011-10-20T08:00:59  <delt0r> you are a women?

2011-10-20T08:02:57  <delt0r> seriously danielha_ I don't pay attenttion to handels as they have nothing much to do with the person. I don't see gender as important for something like this
2011-10-20T08:03:03  <mcstar> as much as David Sandstrom
2011-10-20T08:03:07  <delt0r> delt0r is a math term and is quite genderless
2011-10-20T08:03:36  <danielha_> it's not my gender / sex - it's the kind of macho, elitist RTFM crap for something that was pretty much buried.
2011-10-20T08:03:49  <delt0r> so if there was offence danielha_ I do apologize. It was not intended.
2011-10-20T08:04:01  <mcstar> danielha_: yesterday i coined the term rtft, you are spot on

2011-10-20T08:13:54  <Posterdati> mcstar: so your ants are all dead
2011-10-20T08:13:55  <mcstar> ah sure
2011-10-20T08:14:17  <mcstar> delt0r: they want your tcp even more
2011-10-20T08:14:28  <delt0r> you mean play TCP
2011-10-20T08:14:32  <delt0r> or a tcp server?
2011-10-20T08:14:37  <mcstar> sure
2011-10-20T08:14:39  <delt0r> thought there was already a server
2011-10-20T08:14:56  <delt0r> I have a bot observer
2011-10-20T08:14:57  <mcstar> i dont think its complete

2011-10-20T08:15:41  <mcstar> and not with hills ans such for sure
2011-10-20T08:15:47  <mcstar> and*
2011-10-20T08:16:09  <delt0r> I was thinking of supporting the python engine too
2011-10-20T08:16:14  <mcstar> good
2011-10-20T08:16:22  <delt0r> so that changes don't always need to be reflected
2011-10-20T08:16:38  <delt0r> but you probably won't be able to watch a game while its playing
2011-10-20T08:16:48  <mcstar> why?
2011-10-20T08:17:02  <delt0r> and your local python installtion will need to be correct
2011-10-20T08:17:06  <mcstar> marco had a java in-play visualizer
2011-10-20T08:17:28  <mcstar> anyway, i dont care, im not the target audience
2011-10-20T08:17:41  <delt0r> is that with the stream game format?
2011-10-20T08:17:42  <mcstar> i dont yet know the usefulness of the tcp server
2011-10-20T08:17:52  <mcstar> i think so
2011-10-20T08:18:06  <delt0r> i think its a little ambiguous (stream game format)
2011-10-20T08:18:21  <mcstar> so is my answer
2011-10-20T08:18:31  <mcstar> best to take a look at it yourself
2011-10-20T08:18:33  <delt0r> give locations, but you can't be sure which ant moved to where... just the final result

2011-10-20T08:19:14  <mcstar> have you seen that marco added a new option to the js visualizer?
2011-10-20T08:19:22  <delt0r> nope
2011-10-20T08:19:35  <delt0r> again the visualizer this year is awesome
2011-10-20T08:19:35  <mcstar> you can copy instantly the input for your bot to reproduce the gameplay
2011-10-20T08:19:41  <delt0r> so little need for my one
2011-10-20T08:19:54  <delt0r> ?
2011-10-20T08:20:04  <mcstar> just try it
2011-10-20T08:20:21  <delt0r> the input to any one bot is incomplete.
2011-10-20T08:20:33  <mcstar> hah
2011-10-20T08:20:38  <mcstar> i dont know what you mean
2011-10-20T08:21:14  <mcstar> the only problem, is if the bot has some true pseudorandomness in it
2011-10-20T08:21:21  <mcstar> than it will diverge from its input
2011-10-20T08:21:48  <mcstar> expected input*
2011-10-20T08:22:02  <delt0r> you mean bots output? it can't control its input
2011-10-20T08:22:14  <mcstar> i meant what i wrote
2011-10-20T08:22:44  <delt0r> one bot does not see the full game state. that is what i mean my incomplete

2011-10-20T08:23:03  <mcstar> so?
2011-10-20T08:23:36  <mcstar> if the bot only initializes its random number generator, by player_seed, than this will work
2011-10-20T08:24:00  <mcstar> you can recreate the game by feeding it the input data from the visualizer

2011-10-20T08:34:05  <delt0r> it never seems to bet polys+ razterizers at the game however
2011-10-20T08:34:13  <delt0r> there is always some catch
2011-10-20T08:35:13  <mcstar> argh
2011-10-20T08:35:19  <delt0r> from the examples there is a lot of instancing and not much independent geometry
2011-10-20T08:35:21  <mcstar> what does this mean?
2011-10-20T08:35:33  <Accoun> some were is sectet TCP server- i know it!
2011-10-20T08:35:34  <mcstar> ah, thats not important

2011-10-20T08:35:49  <delt0r> lol
2011-10-20T08:36:01  <mcstar> delt0r: they can do it with not repeating patters too
2011-10-20T08:36:25  <delt0r> there is still real physical limits to what you can store...
2011-10-20T08:36:30  <mcstar> they say, they have a search lagorithm, that searchis this "point cloud data" and only rasterizes pixels that would appear onthe screen
2011-10-20T08:36:32  <delt0r> polys are pretty cheap
2011-10-20T08:36:42  <mcstar> pfff
2011-10-20T08:36:43  <delt0r> even pixar (aka renderman) use that
2011-10-20T08:36:44  <mcstar> searches
2011-10-20T08:36:50  <mcstar> aham
2011-10-20T08:36:58  <mcstar> so this is not new?
2011-10-20T08:37:09  <delt0r> yea i remeber when they were making a fuss about it last year
2011-10-20T08:37:14  <delt0r> not really

2011-10-20T08:37:53  <delt0r> but that is not good enough --it needs to be better than current stuff so its worth the "upgrade"
2011-10-20T08:38:11  <mcstar> well, they say it is without 3d accel
2011-10-20T08:38:27  <mcstar> if some writes this for the gpu, it can be pretty impressive
2011-10-20T08:38:36  <delt0r> And well razterised renderers with shaders and passes is hard to beat

2011-10-20T08:39:16  <delt0r> so you probably need to convert to get good performance....

2011-10-20T08:47:36  <delt0r> but in java you use other dir or packages...

2011-10-20T08:47:43  <delt0r> Awesome
2011-10-20T08:47:59  <sir_macelon> I tried that already
2011-10-20T08:48:17  <ermau> So, given appropriate licenses, we're allowed to use open source code in our bots right?
2011-10-20T08:48:25  <mcstar> sir_macelon: are you already using libs?
2011-10-20T08:48:46  <mcstar> ermau: it must fit a 2MBs archive
2011-10-20T08:48:59  <lrh9__> mcstar, well I'm using the Python starter package at the moment. The default bot's do_turn method accepts ants, so I'm trying to understand what ants is and how it works.
2011-10-20T08:49:09  <ermau> mcstar: o..k...?
2011-10-20T08:49:24  <sir_macelon> mcstar: no, only packages, it means subfolders for class files
2011-10-20T08:49:40  <mcstar> k
2011-10-20T08:49:41  <sir_macelon> mcstar: that's how java source code's getting orgainzed
2011-10-20T08:50:02  <TankEnMate> mcstar: the perl install is an ubuntu default 5.10.1 install?
2011-10-20T08:50:17  <mcstar> TankEnMate: the current server is still natty
2011-10-20T08:50:20  <mcstar> i think
2011-10-20T08:50:29  <TankEnMate> okies, thanks.
2011-10-20T08:50:49  <TankEnMate> C# is mono then?
2011-10-20T08:50:51  <mcstar> lrh9__: i think McLeopold wrote the python starter
2011-10-20T08:51:09  <mcstar> but you can easily write your own, you dont have to figure out anything
2011-10-20T08:51:19  <lrh9__> From what I can tell it is just an api that abstracts obtaining data from given turn data. But what I'm wondering is this ants api going to be supplied by the contest operators, or can we use our own?
2011-10-20T08:51:19  <mcstar> TankEnMate: basically
2011-10-20T08:51:32  <mcstar> i mean yes ok
2011-10-20T08:52:06  <mcstar> lrh9__: nothing is supplied only the input
2011-10-20T08:52:10  <smiley1983> lrh9__: Currently that api is implemented in ants.py, but you can replace it if you want
2011-10-20T08:52:18  <mcstar> you must put all sources into the archive

2011-10-20T08:53:16  <ermau> ah
2011-10-20T08:53:16  <lrh9__> (I don't understand how getting input from stdin works, but I guess that's not for me to worry about. I just need to handle it correctly.)

2011-10-20T08:54:08  <mcstar> lrh9__: IO is one of the first things you have to consider when dealing with a new language
2011-10-20T08:54:23  <mcstar> python has input() i think

2011-10-20T09:00:24  <TankEnMate> mcstar: i noticed a couple of the perl bots said "compiled but failed tests", do perl bots need a working test harness?
2011-10-20T09:01:00  <smiley1983> I think those are the test cases which all bots must pass in order to be given games
2011-10-20T09:01:16  <mcstar> TankEnMate: test_bot.sh
2011-10-20T09:01:41  <TankEnMate> the perl starter doesn't include test_bot.sh, what needs to go in it?
2011-10-20T09:02:08  <mcstar> TankEnMate: you need the tools
2011-10-20T09:02:19  <mcstar> and always try your bot locally before you upload

2011-10-20T09:16:25  <mcstar> dd: accept them, and check some box
2011-10-20T09:17:15  <dd> Hm, what's that accepting it for though - that page only (which is fine) or all local HTML? Or even all remote too?
2011-10-20T09:17:25  <mcstar> TankEnMate: i dont think theres a limitation as to where your code can come from, basically, different registered entities are not allowed to work together/share code
2011-10-20T09:18:22  <dd> Also, if I click "deny" it works fine. Is it totally necessary to be requesting those permissions?
2011-10-20T09:18:34  <mcstar> dd: k, no idea, but theres some popup something that comes up, when you try it in a new browser session
2011-10-20T09:18:54  <mcstar> accept that with checking that box too, and it wont come up, unless you re-start your browser
2011-10-20T09:18:58  <mcstar> so it isnt permanent
2011-10-20T09:19:17  <dd> OK, cheers.
2011-10-20T09:19:22  <mcstar> it is, since java accesses your local file system, which it cant do otherwise

2011-10-20T09:20:24  <TankEnMate> mcstar: the rules don't mention anything about network connections, i assume that is verbotten as well.

2011-10-20T09:23:46  <mcstar> yeah, cant do that
2011-10-20T09:24:16  <TankEnMate> by definition if you have a network connection with anything meaningful happening it is by definition multi processing, just not on the same device.
2011-10-20T09:24:32  <mcstar> amstan_: you need to extend http://aichallenge.org/rules.php with at least "no network connections allowed"
2011-10-20T09:25:05  <mcstar> not really
2011-10-20T09:25:19  <mcstar> if you dont get back anything, why would it be multi-processing?

2011-10-20T10:39:06  <delt0r> jcdjcd: turns out the mem limits are somewhat problematic.. 1Gb should be fine i suspect
2011-10-20T10:39:50  <delt0r> but for example java uses lots of virtual memeory (as in not real mem that is not mapped etc) and the instances can't work out that its not real mem
2011-10-20T10:40:02  <delt0r> so in java for example it may be less...

2011-10-20T10:40:51  <delt0r> this is not really a java thing per say... for example if you used large memory mapped files in a instance this would have the same issue. However that does not really apply here
2011-10-20T10:41:58  <mcstar> delt0r: sbcl asks for 8GB on 64bit systems
2011-10-20T10:42:05  <delt0r> right
2011-10-20T10:42:26  <delt0r> but my guess that is virtual as well right?
2011-10-20T10:42:58  <mcstar> once i messed with linux memory allocation, disabeled over-allocation, well, sbcl stopped working
2011-10-20T10:43:06  <mcstar> it isnt virtual
2011-10-20T10:43:13  <mcstar> i mean this isnt the proper term
2011-10-20T10:43:14  <delt0r> personally i am surprised by how poor instances/virtulization is

2011-10-20T11:14:48  <itelichko> These circles around ant hills in the visualiser, what they show?
2011-10-20T11:15:26  <larrydag> i believe enemy ants approaching the hill
2011-10-20T11:16:26  <avdg> it looks like it is indeed the enemy ants aprouching the hill
2011-10-20T11:17:24  <itelichko> I thought so, but sometimes they are not shown. For example - http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=38452&user=26, turn 50, blue hil in the right bottom.
2011-10-20T11:17:48  <itelichko> There are two enemy ants next to the hill, but no circle around it.
2011-10-20T11:18:13  <itelichko> I see that quite a lot.
2011-10-20T11:18:18  <avdg> which row/col?
2011-10-20T11:18:37  <itelichko> row 71, col 75
2011-10-20T11:19:13  <sir_macelon> itelichko: because these circles show that a hill will be captured soon
2011-10-20T11:19:54  <sir_macelon> in this case although enemy ant was close the hill was not threatened
2011-10-20T11:20:13  <avdg> the circle appears at around turn 100
2011-10-20T11:20:33  <sir_macelon> this lets you focus on when a hill is being razed
2011-10-20T11:20:36  <itelichko> I see. So if enemies will not capture the hill this time, there will be no circle.
2011-10-20T11:21:58  <mcstar> i think if not that enemy will capture it, than theres gonna be no circle
2011-10-20T11:22:19  <mcstar> or maybe it is turn dependent
2011-10-20T11:22:22  <sir_macelon> itelichko: yes, exactly
2011-10-20T11:22:48  <sir_macelon> mcstar: I've noticed the circle is shown 30 turns before a hill is razed

2011-10-20T11:32:04  <lrh9__> One of the rules states that we can read from files. Would loading precomputed values - say square roots - violate the rules or the spirit of the rules?
2011-10-20T11:32:16  <mcstar> of course not
2011-10-20T11:32:25  <mcstar> but that is a bad example
2011-10-20T11:32:47  <mcstar> it takes more time to fetch it from memory than to recompute it
2011-10-20T11:33:40  <mcstar> lrh9__: the limit is that your archive must be within 2MBs
2011-10-20T11:33:56  <mcstar> but this opens up an interesting bug
2011-10-20T11:34:06  <ermau> next game? I can't even login (I wonder if some accounts were cleared yesterday?)
2011-10-20T11:35:03  <mcstar> you are worrying over nuances
2011-10-20T11:35:30  <mcstar> could you log in at least once?
2011-10-20T11:35:50  <ermau> mcstar: Yeah
2011-10-20T11:36:03  <ermau> I registered and logged in a few times before registrations were closed yesterday
2011-10-20T11:36:10  <mcstar> than clearly, you have forgotten your password
2011-10-20T11:36:20  <lrh9__> mcstar, I'm not sure it would be slower. I'm doing a simple test (so my testing methodology may be flawed) but according to my timeits calculating the square root of a number is a little over twice as slow as looking it up from a dictionary of number, square root pairs.
2011-10-20T11:36:26  <ermau> mcstar: Not a chance.

2011-10-20T11:36:54  <lrh9__> Yes.
2011-10-20T11:36:58  <mcstar> use numpy
2011-10-20T11:37:25  <mcstar> it is slow, beacuse python must dispatch on its dynamic variable's type
2011-10-20T11:37:39  <mcstar> you are not measuring sqrt speed
2011-10-20T11:38:14  <mcstar> ermau: all i can say is that i can log in
2011-10-20T11:38:32  <mcstar> and the admins dont delete accounts "just that"

2011-10-20T11:39:16  <mcstar> they either delete all, or none

2011-10-20T11:40:39  <andy> is there any way of logging during a game on the local computer (I'm using java). I suspect it could be problematic since System.out is used to issue commands to the server
2011-10-20T11:41:04  <mcstar> andy: you can use standard error output
2011-10-20T11:41:10  <ruser> so the sumbissions are open again?
2011-10-20T11:41:12  <mcstar> use -e -E flags with playgame.py
2011-10-20T11:41:19  <andy> alright. thanks

2011-10-20T11:55:46  <ruser> avdg: i think it means, if you try to make another opponent win based on some data, that is considred cheating and you will be disqualified

2011-10-20T11:55:54  <sir_macelon> avdg: it means you cannot base your strategy on some other opponent's strategy

2011-10-20T11:59:28  <mcstar> it means: you cannot identify specific enemies, you CAN identify startegies, but cannot make action regarding another player's identity: i.e.: you match a "behavoir" to A.Smith, and your code copntains explicitely: if i encounter A.Smith, i will collaborate with him
2011-10-20T11:59:35  <rogerhall> any thoughts ermau? Was there no administrative deleting?
2011-10-20T11:59:55  <donpdonp> the ruby starter package has two .rb files. it does not have 'One hundred randomly generated maps that you can use for testing'. where can i get some maps?
2011-10-20T12:00:04  <lrh9__> The way I interpret it is that if you can somehow tell that a bot belongs to player Bob, you can't write a bot that combats Bob's specific implementation. I'd think that opponent modeling (as in gather data that is legally available and making decisions based on it) would and should be legal.

2011-10-20T12:25:57  <djr_> just personal reasons, i'm really busy at school until 2 months from now..

2011-10-20T12:44:07  <smiley1983> no worries :)
2011-10-20T12:44:12  <ash0d> so basically we'll be able to experiment and upload modifications of our bots until the closing date, at which point the real tournament will start?
2011-10-20T12:45:17  <mcstar> this is gonna be the real turnament, that is the finals
2011-10-20T12:45:25  <mcstar> tournament*
2011-10-20T12:46:12  <ash0d> so we get only one submission?

2011-10-20T12:49:31  <lrh9__> Should we scrap input validation from a starter package to increase execution speed or is it pretty much vital? I wouldn't expect malformed or nonstandard input from the contest.
2011-10-20T12:50:01  <antimatroid> imo very little time is actually used on reading input in the end

2011-10-20T12:55:24  <Siretu> If I have speed problems I might switch from python
2011-10-20T12:55:29  <danielha_> if it's even possible :O

2011-10-20T12:56:36  <antimatroid> lol, the state space for planet wars and ants were both unimaginably large
2011-10-20T12:56:37  <Siretu> Nice, how did the first homework go?
2011-10-20T12:57:04  <danielha_> 85%. not great, but OK
2011-10-20T12:57:07  <Siretu> I haven't finished all the lectures for this week yet, nor the homework. I am finding less time for everything

2011-10-20T12:57:17  <rmmh> annoyed that they think loaded coins are partially observable

2011-10-20T13:03:47  <Zannick> i wouldn't upload the part that generates the bot :P
2011-10-20T13:04:10  <ash0d> i see :)
2011-10-20T13:04:17  <antimatroid> you can't write to file on the server anyway, so you might as well just train it before submitting
2011-10-20T13:04:19  <ash0d> you'll generate based on genetic
2011-10-20T13:04:32  <mcstar> Zannick: yeah, evolving a bot under 1 sec is not really feasible on current EC2 machines
2011-10-20T13:04:32  <Zannick> that is how it's usually done, yes
2011-10-20T13:04:48  <ash0d> that may work, if you have enough cycles until the closing date :P
2011-10-20T13:05:12  <rmmh> isn't the resulting algorithm pretty much opaque and impossible to tweak
2011-10-20T13:05:15  <Zannick> mcstar: not really only that, but with more time to generate a bot it'll generate a better one
2011-10-20T13:05:29  <rmmh> you just have to modify the evolver and model parameters and hope you get better results
2011-10-20T13:05:57  <xunie-laptop> Say, I was wondering. What if my bot crashes during a game? Can I build in error reporting facilities in my bot?
2011-10-20T13:06:29  <mcstar> previously, you had a chunk of stderr on your profile page
2011-10-20T13:06:35  <mcstar> but i dont see it anymore
2011-10-20T13:06:49  <xunie-laptop> Like, maybe it's handy that stderr will be outputted to a file for later retrieval.
2011-10-20T13:06:57  <ash0d> this reminds me, what about logging? can we enable it?
2011-10-20T13:06:58  <mcstar> nah
2011-10-20T13:07:14  <xunie-laptop> I mean, the bot can't write to files itself. So... :/
2011-10-20T13:07:20  <antimatroid> it can locally
2011-10-20T13:07:23  <antimatroid> just not on the server
2011-10-20T13:07:55  <mcstar> you can output to stderr as i said, and previously, i know fore sure, you could see the end of the error output when your bot crashed
2011-10-20T13:08:17  <Laie> what language can i develop the AI?
2011-10-20T13:08:22  <mcstar> now, either it got changed, or simply my bot doesnt want to report anything
2011-10-20T13:08:31  <Laie> can i develop with C++?
2011-10-20T13:08:33  <mcstar> but it is possible to re-enable this feature

2011-10-20T13:09:05  <Siretu> There's a list of available languages here: http://aichallenge.org/starter_packages.php
2011-10-20T13:09:13  <antimatroid> shhh, c++ is fine
2011-10-20T13:09:22  <Laie> mcstart / good point i think
2011-10-20T13:09:25  <mcstar> Siretu: no, that is the list of "starter packages"
2011-10-20T13:09:29  <Siretu> well
2011-10-20T13:09:35  <rmmh> Laie: pretty much any language
2011-10-20T13:09:37  <Laie> but maybe 'C' is a variable
2011-10-20T13:09:38  <Siretu> it also contains languages that there are no starter package for?

2011-10-20T13:18:18  <amstan> it's just that some blogs started blogging about us when we were in beta

2011-10-20T14:09:50  <amstan> they're not inverted, just blended

2011-10-20T14:10:14  <aarossig> but this is rarer
2011-10-20T14:10:19  <amstan> aarossig: yes, but if it's dark vs light, it's easy to distinguish
2011-10-20T14:10:21  <ruser> aarossig: yeah, always annoyed me in North America, easter europe they just mark the resistance  :)
2011-10-20T14:10:27  <mleise> McLeopold: the human eye has receptors for color and for brightness. if the brightness is not affected, monochrome is always a good indicator
2011-10-20T14:10:33  <aarossig> I think John sees blue as red or something

2011-10-20T14:12:01  <amstan> the homepage looks ok in grayscale, verything is readable, except the player colours on the visualizer
2011-10-20T14:12:12  <amstan> but i don't expect that to work when there's 10 different colours
2011-10-20T14:12:57  <g0llum> amstan, how did you get that into grayscale ?
2011-10-20T14:13:05  <aarossig> amstan: from what I've seen color blind people don't browse the internet in grayscale
2011-10-20T14:13:07  <mcstar> 1 think that could be done, is a button that lets you cycle colors
2011-10-20T14:13:12  <mcstar> thing*
2011-10-20T14:13:22  <aarossig> now... if we had a button that changed the users preffered colors cheme

2011-10-20T14:13:26  <amstan> aarossig: you don't get it..
2011-10-20T14:13:26  <aarossig> that would be decent
2011-10-20T14:13:37  <aarossig> amstan: it has to do with brightness, i know
2011-10-20T14:13:43  <aarossig> brightness and contrast
2011-10-20T14:13:46  <amstan> no, brightness stays the same
2011-10-20T14:13:52  <amstan> the problem is distinguishing between the hues
2011-10-20T14:14:05  <amstan> as long as grayscale is readable, they should be able to read
2011-10-20T14:14:09  <aarossig> which in graysacle is contrast
2011-10-20T14:14:13  <ash0d> @aarossig: color blind people just have a different ratio of the primary color receptor... they see the colors shifted with the proportions that they lack in receptors

2011-10-20T15:00:44  <mleise> ant___: you can try to print to stderr first
2011-10-20T15:01:00  <mleise> UncleVasya: Who is Dr. Brennan?
2011-10-20T15:01:14  <McLeopold> this is hard, colorblindness sucks :(
2011-10-20T15:01:38  <mleise> http://www.maxrev.de/oh-rly-bild-106941.htm
2011-10-20T15:01:56  <UncleVasya> ant___: I do logging in the text file (like many people here).
2011-10-20T15:02:02  <ant___> is there a way to debug using breakpoints in netbeans, now i only can compile in it

2011-10-20T15:02:21  <ChrisH_> McLeopold, mleise: I think McLeopold's colors are better overall than the current set. (I'm R-G color blind BTW), except the darkets red is a bit hard to see against the brown background of the land spaces.
2011-10-20T15:02:35  <UncleVasya> Some smart guys can debug right from their IDE in the step-mode but I can't.
2011-10-20T15:02:44  <Siretu> Talking about color blindness
2011-10-20T15:02:45  <ant___> logging into file is annoying
2011-10-20T15:02:59  <Siretu> My friend came to school with a pink pencil that attracted some attention
2011-10-20T15:03:03  <mleise> ChrisH_: oh good then. I didn't expect that :)
2011-10-20T15:03:09  <Siretu> Turns out he bought thinking it was gray
2011-10-20T15:03:12  <antimatroid> hmmmm any game theorists here?
2011-10-20T15:03:24  <Siretu> bought it*
2011-10-20T15:03:26  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I'd like to see a sample image with the ants more interspersed though, cause that's when it gets anoying.
2011-10-20T15:03:28  <antimatroid> nevermind
2011-10-20T15:03:29  <mleise> Siretu: lol

2011-10-20T15:06:02  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: I'm getting it to look getter, I think
2011-10-20T15:06:08  <McLeopold> better
2011-10-20T15:07:02  <ant___> moving the ant doesnt change tile's state to occupied, so can kill ants moving into one unoccupied tile same turn, thats nasty
2011-10-20T15:07:38  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: Yes, I think you are making progress. I had issues with the colors a few weeks ago, and mleise and I chatted and he made some improvements, but I still have problems tellins some of the colors apart when they are all mixed together rather than in big clumps like your sample.
2011-10-20T15:07:40  <ant___> need double check, any thoughts to avoid that?
2011-10-20T15:08:02  <Siretu> Isn't there a fix for it in the start of the ant tutorial?
2011-10-20T15:08:07  <Siretu> The fix was for python though
2011-10-20T15:08:10  <Siretu> using a dictionary
2011-10-20T15:08:18  <Siretu> Assuming I understood your issue
2011-10-20T15:08:55  <Siretu> Basically, save where you're ordering your ants to move and don't move an ant to to a tile that another ant is already going to move to next turn
2011-10-20T15:09:05  <ant___> dont know just found my ants diying out themselves

2011-10-20T15:11:22  <rmmh> ChrisH_: I have trouble distinguishing some of the colors too, and I'm not even colorblind :(

2011-10-20T15:12:09  <Siretu> Okay
2011-10-20T15:12:27  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: What am I looking for in that image?
2011-10-20T15:12:31  <McLeopold> Siretu: every new submission is evaluated separately from the previous
2011-10-20T15:12:31  <rmmh> Siretu: the ranking algorithm is (I believe) very close to what's used on Xbox Live for ranking human players against each other
2011-10-20T15:12:37  <ant___> Siretu submit at any time u want, dont think it matters much, cz ur rating is only how u do vs others
2011-10-20T15:12:41  <rmmh> or that, HEH
2011-10-20T15:12:41  <mcstar> McLeopold: i can see from IR to UV distinguishing 16 million colors
2011-10-20T15:13:11  <Siretu> okay
2011-10-20T15:13:12  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: the boxes will be the ant colors, the surrounding colors are water, food, land, and the bottom is green
2011-10-20T15:13:24  <McLeopold> mcstar: I thought mleise said you were blind?
2011-10-20T15:13:31  <mcstar> i dont think so
2011-10-20T15:13:35  <mcstar> but otherwise i like them
2011-10-20T15:14:02  <mcstar> lol
2011-10-20T15:14:05  <mcstar> blind
2011-10-20T15:14:12  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: Ok, the problem with me looking at that image is that when the boxes are that big I can see the differences a lot more easily than when they are little circles (even at full screen 1600x1200).
2011-10-20T15:14:29  <rmmh> maybe textured circles?
2011-10-20T15:14:32  <janzert> is there an easy way to visualize a map locally?
2011-10-20T15:14:40  <McLeopold> oops, stocha
2011-10-20T15:14:55  <mcstar> yep he is
2011-10-20T15:15:08  <McLeopold> mcstar: I get you two mixed up because your both very opinionated :)
2011-10-20T15:15:11  <mcstar> but only colorblind, not "blind" as you said
2011-10-20T15:15:12  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: Example, I can tell red and green apart if it is a grass field next to a field of red flowers, but I have trouble seeing a single red flower in the middle of a big grass field.
2011-10-20T15:15:39  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: I'll try another screen shot with these colors, and try to mix up the ants some
2011-10-20T15:15:43  <mcstar> i dont have "both"

2011-10-20T15:48:06  <mleise> McLeopold: now the visualizer doesn't support old replays with up to 26 players any more
2011-10-20T15:48:22  <mleise> let me see
2011-10-20T15:48:25  <McLeopold> mleise: we never had more than 8

2011-10-20T15:48:47  <McLeopold> well, some 9 and 10
2011-10-20T15:49:22  <mleise> It works for me. Yeah right, there were no maps with more than 10 players anyway. I could as well fix the replay parser to not allow player numbers above 10

2011-10-20T15:51:03  <mleise> oops undefined variable colormaps. that was why i asked if it still works with the user variable
2011-10-20T15:52:05  <mleise> McLeopold: If "user" is given on the URL that user is will get assigned the first color in the array, so you always see yourself as 'green' for example.
2011-10-20T15:52:25  <mleise> In the Replay class you can find it as the parameter 'swapUser'
2011-10-20T15:55:57  <olexs> what's with game replays in the beta? ReferenceError keeps popping up, are the game records gone already due to upcoming reset at start?
2011-10-20T15:56:09  <rmmh> visualizer should have "simant mode" where it renders ants as red/black, food as little peas, water as rocks... ;)

2011-10-20T16:06:46  <mleise> mcstar: The visualier doesn't look like in the picture because it was ass slow to render the map like that.
2011-10-20T16:07:05  <lrh9> McLeopold, you wrote the Python starter package?
2011-10-20T16:07:21  <mcstar> seems fast
2011-10-20T16:07:33  <rmmh> it's slow
2011-10-20T16:07:37  <mcstar> is it because there are few tiles there?

Above the timeline there's a part that says "# of ants" that displays the number of ants each player has with a colorful bar in their color(bigger bar means more ants), but to the right of all the players' bars there's sometimes a triangle  with a number and the text "hive"

2011-10-20T18:44:06  <jmcarthur> @later tell boegel sorry, i've been kind of MIA for the most part. i haven't made a starter and in fact didn't even know until today that it was launching

2011-10-20T18:44:11  <ChrisH_> mleise, McLeopold: the orange and yellow colors are hard to tell apart. If there are no better color choices, I request that one of the two of those be the last color assigned so that they appear in the same game as infrequently as possible.
2011-10-20T18:45:15  <jmcarthur> guess i will have to decide whether to get involved

2011-10-20T18:47:24  <deltree_> does it still use the same basic command line string parsing?
2011-10-20T18:47:52  <jmcarthur> i doubt that has changed much

2011-10-20T18:55:21  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: the hues are about as far apart as I can get 10 colors, so the remaining tweeks would need to be with brightness
2011-10-20T18:55:27  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: That's a step back. The green and orange are really tough. Pastels are more difficult to deal with because the don't have much difference in brightness.

2011-10-20T18:58:20  <jmcarthur> the spec does not say that # denotes a comment in the input format. is that intended? does that mean i can rely on the server never sending a comment? (usually a safe assumption anyway, i know)
2011-10-20T18:58:40  <jmcarthur> if i don't have to worry about comments then all white space is equal, making things very simple
2011-10-20T18:59:20  <Zannick> jmcarthur: " If the bot encounters an unknown parameter it should treat the value as an opaque string and not try to parse it in any way."
2011-10-20T18:59:46  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: back for a sec. My particular color blindness makes it really hard to tell the difference between the light orange and light green shades. Shades of blue I see easily, so making the hues far apart in abolute terms isn't always ideal for me. Of course there are other types of color blindness that make other colors hard to distinguish. :(

2011-10-20T19:05:30  <ChrisH_> McLeopold, mleise: if you could put a little black dot in the middle of either the orange or the yellow and either the cyan or the gray, that would be a huge help
2011-10-20T19:05:49  <jmcarthur> i guess the unknown token thing is also what allows the server to extend the protocol in a backward compatible way, and tokenizing without regard to newlines would violate some assumptions
2011-10-20T19:05:51  <ChrisH_> mleise: about the same
2011-10-20T19:05:57  <ChrisH_> afk for a bit
2011-10-20T19:05:59  <mleise> in direct comparison it doesn't seem to change much if the colors change around, a texture would help

2011-10-20T19:09:30  <jmcarthur> the spec says you can occupy the same space as an enemy. this implies that neither ant dies in this scenario? do they not even combat as normal?

2011-10-20T19:11:04  <jmcarthur> "You can order 2 ants to the same space. If you do this, both ants will die. You can be on the same space as an enemy. This can happen if an ant spawns next to an enemy."
2011-10-20T19:11:13  <jmcarthur> jhines0042: if you are correct then the above statement seems ambiguous to me
2011-10-20T19:11:40  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: okay, made some contrast changes, check out ant paste again
2011-10-20T19:11:54  <jmcarthur> well, it actually seems ambiguous whichever way, but your statement seems even less obvious from the spec
2011-10-20T19:12:01  <jhines0042> jmcarthur: I read that as "if two ants occupy the same space they will both die.  This can happen because ants can spawn inside of your ant's attack radius."

2011-10-20T19:13:24  <jhines0042> but definitely your ants will kill each other if they share the same space.

2011-10-20T19:37:15  <ChrisH_> mleise: or something closer to the color of the dirt so the colors look more consistant.
2011-10-20T19:37:33  <ChrisH_> mleise: I'm sure that would have other problems though.  ;)

2011-10-20T19:37:45  <janzert> maybe the dirt should become quite light?

2011-10-20T19:38:03  <janzert> so it's not that differrent from the white background?
2011-10-20T19:38:20  <ChrisH_> janzert: maybe, and then the ants would need to be darker
2011-10-20T19:38:47  <rmmh> that sounds like a bad idea
2011-10-20T19:38:54  <janzert> yes, although the color for them already has to show up good on a white background

2011-10-20T19:40:33  <ChrisH_> janzert: that is true, and we won't know until we try it, but it is the small size of the ants that makes it difficult, they just don't project onto a very large area of your retina, making it harder to see the actual color
2011-10-20T19:40:42  <nikkos> hey anyone on here that is using the common lisp start kit?

2011-10-20T19:43:53  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: did you change the ant colors at all, or just the dirt color?
2011-10-20T19:43:56  <rmmh> lol what is happening
2011-10-20T19:43:59  <McLeopold> just dirt
2011-10-20T19:44:00  <rmmh> pure black now
2011-10-20T19:44:02  <Zannick> :o
2011-10-20T19:44:07  <janzert> and neither does black
2011-10-20T19:44:17  <Zannick> now the water is hard to see :P
2011-10-20T19:44:18  <rmmh> I would be fine with black :V
2011-10-20T19:44:18  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: fascinating, I now have no problem with the two colors I had problems with before.
2011-10-20T19:44:19  <mleise> lights in the sky
2011-10-20T19:44:52  <Zannick> not that hard but i have to really look
2011-10-20T19:44:58  <jmcarthur> so the "hive" is a kind of an omnipresent entity, distinct from hills?
2011-10-20T19:45:05  <ChrisH_> maybe a light tan color for dirt would be good
2011-10-20T19:45:11  <janzert> jmcarthur: yes
2011-10-20T19:45:28  <ermau> it'd be really nice if the engine said why a bot was eliminated when it was eliminated
2011-10-20T19:45:33  <ermau> make it easier to debug
2011-10-20T19:46:00  <McLeopold> ermau: it does
2011-10-20T19:46:03  <jmcarthur> what are the rings that appear around the hills?
2011-10-20T19:46:14  <rmmh> they indicate when enemy ants approach

2011-10-20T19:46:59  <McLeopold> check the colors again
2011-10-20T19:47:07  <janzert> amstan: not really
2011-10-20T19:47:21  <ermau> McLeopold: I just see "bot 3 eliminated" and "eliminated" at the end.. but there was no gameplay reason why it would have been, so it must have violated a rule or something
2011-10-20T19:47:47  <McLeopold> ermau: I'm thinking of game end
2011-10-20T19:47:56  <ermau> McLeopold: It doesn't say there either
2011-10-20T19:47:57  <McLeopold> bots are only eliminated by losing all ants

2011-10-20T19:48:40  <janzert> seems like the dirt should be redder

2011-10-20T20:25:04  <j3camero> janzert: what do you need me to do? Is the webserver and the workers still on your dime? If so, we should transfer them so it's costing me money instead.
2011-10-20T20:25:15  <aarossig> jonathanasdf: not exactly sure at this point
2011-10-20T20:25:37  <janzert> j3camero: it would actually be easier if I can just send you an amount each month
2011-10-20T20:25:38  <a1k0n> C++ one does!
2011-10-20T20:26:00  <janzert> especially for the main server right now
2011-10-20T20:26:16  <j3camero> janzert: that is fine with me. What is your preferred method of transfer?

2011-10-20T20:26:30  <mleise> D and Pascal are ok, but Clojure lacked hill information last time I looked
2011-10-20T20:26:36  <janzert> but for the workers too it would make it easier for me to track that we come out at our budget

2011-10-20T21:37:47  <amstan> ermau: pull requests should be individual features
2011-10-20T21:38:05  <deltree_> j3camero: all the tutorials, in fact, as I recall, the visualizer for PlanetWars was in Java
2011-10-20T21:38:28  <j3camero> deltree_: oh true. I was thinking of the backend software. But you're right.
2011-10-20T21:38:32  <aarossig> j3camero: now now, we do have IE support thanks to java :P

2011-10-20T21:39:04  <j3camero> aarossig: I'm not hating on Java. I use it at work all day. Just saying it's not ideal for software that involves precise timing or interprocess communication.
2011-10-20T21:39:05  <deltree_> like tron & pw
2011-10-20T21:39:27  <deltree_> j3camero: it may be too forward, but what language is your back-end written in?

2011-10-20T22:13:12  <jonathanasdf> just do it in ruby then o.o
2011-10-20T22:13:15  <deltree_> lol
2011-10-20T22:13:19  <ChrisH_> deltree_: what is your everyday language?
2011-10-20T22:13:28  <jonathanasdf> ruby and python are similar enough imo lol
2011-10-20T22:13:50  <deltree_> c# is my work language, so it's where I live these days.  Looks like I may be moving to c++ or java soon (depending on which job pulls through)
2011-10-20T22:14:16  <deltree_> used a few others.  I've coded in something like 17 languages
2011-10-20T22:14:21  <deltree_> but not very well in many
2011-10-20T22:14:28  <jonathanasdf> C# and VS? do you use resharper? I don't think I can live without that anymore lol
2011-10-20T22:14:35  <ermau> <3 R#
2011-10-20T22:14:40  <deltree_> I never understood resharper
2011-10-20T22:14:47  <ermau> O_O
2011-10-20T22:14:57  <deltree_> it took me 3 months to come around to saying "OK, VS is faster"
2011-10-20T22:15:02  <deltree_> I don't understand IDEs
2011-10-20T22:15:05  <jonathanasdf> :???
2011-10-20T22:15:10  <deltree_> have yet to find a book or tutorial that makes sense to me
2011-10-20T22:15:15  <jonathanasdf> resharper is a plugin for VS....
2011-10-20T22:15:23  <deltree_> I know what resharper is
2011-10-20T22:15:25  <jonathanasdf> oh
2011-10-20T22:15:29  <jonathanasdf> I misunderstood your statement
2011-10-20T22:15:35  <deltree_> one of my co-workers installed it for me and told me it was better
2011-10-20T22:15:41  <jonathanasdf> you mean to say that you used to think coding in say notepad was faster
2011-10-20T22:15:43  <deltree_> it just kept crashing my machine
2011-10-20T22:15:54  <jonathanasdf> o.o
2011-10-20T22:16:28  <deltree_> jonathanasdf: I custom built my own tools for compiling etc
2011-10-20T22:16:55  <ermau> ..why would you do that?
2011-10-20T22:17:20  <jonathanasdf> so you didn't use VS's solutions, nor ant scripts?
2011-10-20T22:17:26  <jonathanasdf> lol...
2011-10-20T22:17:33  <deltree_> ermau: for the first 3 months I worked at my job, I didn't have admin rights or VS, so I had to work around it
2011-10-20T22:17:34  <a1k0n> or even.. nmake?
2011-10-20T22:17:41  <deltree_> that was when I was learning c#
2011-10-20T22:17:47  <ermau> deltree_: That's when you find a new job.
2011-10-20T22:17:48  <deltree_> last year
2011-10-20T22:17:52  <deltree_> during the last competition
2011-10-20T22:18:01  <ermau> amstan: There we go, should be set now
2011-10-20T22:18:12  <a1k0n> does visual studio still do weird shit to enable precompiled headers (e.g. magic sauce around #include "stdafx.h"?)

2011-10-20T22:18:20  <deltree_> jonathanasdf: I used the scripts that were provided and compiled them with csc.exe last year
2011-10-20T22:18:22  <a1k0n> or i guess c++ specific so nm
2011-10-20T22:18:37  <jonathanasdf> can't say I heard of csc.exe so can't comment on it
2011-10-20T22:18:55  <deltree_> it's the C Sharp Compiler that's built into windows
2011-10-20T22:19:08  <deltree_> have to use command prompt to use it
2011-10-20T22:19:28  <adgooroo> Excellent - I just logged in to check on the c# starter project... looks it doesn't have any support for Hills?
2011-10-20T22:19:29  <deltree_> so I custom built a application to make it simpler
2011-10-20T22:19:32  <ermau> You write C# and don't know what CSC is? :-\

2011-10-20T22:19:53  <ermau> adgooroo: Yeah :-\  I'm working on patching in support for it now
2011-10-20T22:19:57  <jonathanasdf> and can't say I really have much experience in C# either...
2011-10-20T22:20:04  <adgooroo> cool ... saves me the trouble ;-)
2011-10-20T22:20:06  <jonathanasdf> just a few small projects here and there, nothing in actual companies
2011-10-20T22:20:09  <ermau> jonathanasdf: So do I..
2011-10-20T22:20:11  <ermau> jonathanasdf: Ah ok
2011-10-20T22:20:32  <ermau> I think it's important to know how everything works, even if I don't need to mess with it directly.
2011-10-20T22:20:34  <jonathanasdf> hmm i should probably go finish the tutorial..
2011-10-20T22:20:51  <jonathanasdf> ermau: my philosophy is, only do that when stuff breaks
2011-10-20T22:21:05  <adgooroo> jonathanasdf - what was your question about C#/VS?
2011-10-20T22:21:09  <jonathanasdf> eventually, stuff WILL break and then I'll have to learn it, but until then, I'll rely on the magic
2011-10-20T22:21:12  <jonathanasdf> adgooroo: nothing
2011-10-20T22:21:17  <adgooroo> ah ok
2011-10-20T22:21:32  <deltree_> I don't know how hills work or I'd offer to help

2011-10-20T22:52:17  <aarossig> okay, get a reddit mod to take it down.
2011-10-20T22:52:19  <aarossig> it is wrong.

2011-10-20T23:00:14  <f4hy> oh... how did you get a beta invite? just had to know about it?
2011-10-20T23:00:27  <Zannick> it was an open beta, yeah.
2011-10-20T23:00:30  <Zannick> but not the real contest
2011-10-20T23:00:35  <Zannick> where all the awesome is
2011-10-20T23:00:40  <f4hy> sweet
2011-10-20T23:00:46  <Acorn> Is there a rush to get started as soon as the contest starts, or is there no real urgency?
2011-10-20T23:00:47  <f4hy> I bet the beta people have a leg up though
2011-10-20T23:01:01  <Zannick> they changed the rules just before the beta ended
2011-10-20T23:01:14  <jhines0042> f4hy: six legs?
2011-10-20T23:01:18  <ChrisH_> Acorn: depends on your personality. You'll have a couple months to work on your code before the final start though.
2011-10-20T23:01:53  <jhines0042> I'm going to rush simply because my latest bot changes haven't been tested in the wild yet and I want to see how they do.
2011-10-20T23:01:55  <ChrisH_> before the finals start, that is.
2011-10-20T23:02:19  <f4hy> will it work that at some point the scores reset and it does a final evaluation? otherwise I bet people will rank up if they get a good bot early while we all submit starter kits
2011-10-20T23:02:19  <Acorn> ChrisH_: ah, that's what I meant, good to know the actual final start is some time away
2011-10-20T23:02:50  <ChrisH_> f4hy: yes, in a few months they will reset and do a final competition
2011-10-20T23:02:56  <f4hy> sweet
2011-10-20T23:03:07  <jhines0042> f4hy: there is plenty of time to be competitive.  I came in last time (Planet Wars) near the end and still placed in the upper 1/3
2011-10-20T23:03:09  <f4hy> My ants are going to die so fast
2011-10-20T23:03:10  <ChrisH_> yeah, it's lots of fun

2011-10-20T23:07:11  <cavilling_elite> I think the biggest challenge is making sure you fit into the timeout clause
2011-10-20T23:07:24  <jhines0042> I thought about go but decided to stick with Java

2011-10-20T23:22:25  <ermau> or just put on the web separately
2011-10-20T23:22:27  <amstan> just find the merge commit, git revert commitnumber
2011-10-20T23:22:40  <amstan> ermau: did you update the starter pack page about it?
2011-10-20T23:22:42  <j3camero> amstan: are the starter package for the Big Four languages more or less working? Do we have some confidence that we won't get massive complaints and discouraged participants?
2011-10-20T23:22:48  <ermau> amstan: No
2011-10-20T23:22:49  <amstan> j3camero: yep, check the page

2011-10-20T23:24:14  <amstan> doing that entails you need another folder, and that's just complicated
2011-10-20T23:24:18  <j3camero> amstan: I see that we have starter packages, but have you heard from people who have actually used them with minimal problems?
2011-10-20T23:24:37  <ermau> amstan: oh the website and github are directly linked?
2011-10-20T23:24:41  <amstan> j3camero: we submitted all of them during beta a few times
2011-10-20T23:24:45  <amstan> j3camero: not with hills though
2011-10-20T23:24:47  <aarossig> j3camero: we'll hear from them at midnight ;)
2011-10-20T23:24:49  <deltree_> amstan, the cleanup code is taking a bit to test

2011-10-20T23:25:14  <amstan> i hope..
2011-10-20T23:25:14  <ermau> j3camero: C# doesn't have hills, I'm adding them right now, but obviously it won't have had the test time as everything else
2011-10-20T23:25:23  <j3camero> amstan: if a starter package has no hills, does it still pretty much work?
2011-10-20T23:25:29  <amstan> yes
2011-10-20T23:25:38  <j3camero> Coolio.
2011-10-20T23:25:41  <amstan> it's a 10 line change to add the hills too, so ...
2011-10-20T23:25:56  <deltree_> well, the basic capture is up
2011-10-20T23:26:03  <deltree_> the next bit is just the button for easy delete
2011-10-20T23:26:08  <deltree_> you just have to merge in my code
2011-10-20T23:26:20  <j3camero> ermau: yes that would be epic. Whenever you think it's pretty smooth and polished, push it over!

2011-10-20T23:34:59  <f4hy> i mean weechat is vary similar to irssi
2011-10-20T23:35:03  <aarossig> ah okay

2011-10-20T23:35:28  <f4hy> if you already have your irssi set up the way you like it probably not worth it though
