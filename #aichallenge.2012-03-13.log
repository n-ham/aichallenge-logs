2012-03-13T03:49:21  <antonh> antimatroid, shoot :)
2012-03-13T04:10:34  <antimatroid> given a set of generators and relations on them calcualate the semigroup the generate
2012-03-13T04:11:11  <antimatroid> eg. {w_1, w_2} with w_iw_i = w_i and w_iw_{i+/-1}w_i generates {w_1, w_2, w_1w_2, w_2w_1}
2012-03-13T04:11:51  <antimatroid> for each element generated (including the generators) you right multiply by each generator and see if the new element is not equivalent to any previously generated elements
2012-03-13T04:12:19  <antimatroid> the hard part (well what i haven't worked out) is how to test equivalence of elements with the given relations
2012-03-13T04:12:28  <antimatroid> antonh: there you go :)
2012-03-13T04:13:20  <antimatroid> the operation is associative on the generators, so is associative on the generated semigroup
2012-03-13T04:14:01  <antimatroid> you don't need to understand what a semi group is
2012-03-13T04:14:20  <antimatroid> basically i want a way to be able to say like w_1w_2w_1 == w_1 from the relations
2012-03-13T04:15:33  <antonh> i'm afraid i don't get it

2012-03-13T12:44:27  <thestinger> so space XOR letter flips that one bit
2012-03-13T12:44:31  <mcstar> i know
2012-03-13T12:44:34  <mcstar> but thats useless
2012-03-13T12:44:36  <thestinger> no
2012-03-13T12:44:54  <thestinger> the difference between the lowercase and uppercase ascii characters is that bit
2012-03-13T12:45:00  <thestinger> 'A' ^ ' ' == 'a'
2012-03-13T12:45:05  <thestinger> 'a' ^ ' ' == 'A'

2012-03-13T12:45:08  <thestinger> etc.
2012-03-13T12:45:12  <mcstar> well, i just xor'd all the c1^c2 with ' '
2012-03-13T12:45:20  <mcstar> with a string of space
2012-03-13T12:45:37  <mcstar> if the numbers were within 65-122 it is a letter
2012-03-13T12:45:44  <mcstar> so probably there was a ' '
2012-03-13T12:45:57  <mcstar> and did histograms for all the products
2012-03-13T12:46:11  <mcstar> so i just saw which product had the most spaces

2012-03-13T12:46:29  <mcstar> possible space to be precise
2012-03-13T12:47:02  <mcstar> so anyway the 10th message was full of spaces and i started from there
2012-03-13T12:47:22  <mcstar> i assumed all of its spaces tranlated to right characters in all the messages
2012-03-13T12:47:35  <mcstar> from that alone i could read almost all messages
2012-03-13T12:47:37  <thestinger> ah
2012-03-13T12:47:40  <thestinger> I tried two ways
2012-03-13T12:48:20  <thestinger> well, I tried to find probable spaces
2012-03-13T12:48:32  <thestinger> but I assumed they threw in a bunch of weird characters after that didn't work out perfectly
2012-03-13T12:48:34  <thestinger> I was wrong
2012-03-13T12:48:48  <thestinger> anyway I did it by taking the letters, and then figuring out very likely ones

2012-03-13T12:50:46  <mcstar> hm?
2012-03-13T12:50:48  <thestinger> and a double space
2012-03-13T12:51:02  <mcstar> yep there are 2 double spaces i think
2012-03-13T12:51:12  <mcstar> (in another one)
2012-03-13T12:51:16  <thestinger> I wrote a little thing to verify, so sec
2012-03-13T12:53:14  <thestinger> yeah, message 10 is weird
2012-03-13T12:53:33  <mcstar> weird, but alright
2012-03-13T12:53:42  <mcstar> just have to figure out whats going on

2012-03-13T17:13:31  <mcstar> (seems all i want to do this night is suppressing)

2012-03-13T17:14:22  <mcstar> anything
2012-03-13T17:14:34  <thestinger> you can catch ctrl-C and exit cleanly
2012-03-13T17:14:37  <mcstar> something that already exists, but i dont know about it
2012-03-13T17:14:37  <Zannick> you could wrap the main in try / catch KeyboardInterrupt: pass
2012-03-13T17:15:02  <Zannick> or s/pass/sys.exit(0)/
2012-03-13T17:15:15  <mcstar> yeah
2012-03-13T17:15:15  <Zannick> or put that somewhere reasonable
2012-03-13T17:16:25  <mcstar> but that wont help in the interpreter
2012-03-13T17:16:38  <Zannick> oh, you want to exit the interpreter?
2012-03-13T17:16:38  <mcstar> lets say im executing single statements
2012-03-13T17:16:41  <mcstar> no
2012-03-13T17:16:49  <mcstar> i call a function

2012-03-13T17:17:52  <mcstar> i mean obviously i dont want to put every statement into a try/catch block
2012-03-13T17:18:16  <mcstar> i just was asking if there was already nicer available
2012-03-13T17:18:31  <mcstar> but the KeyboardInterrupt is good for scripts, thanks

2012-03-13T17:18:49  <thestinger> import signal
2012-03-13T17:18:51  <Zannick> you could define a decorator that will let your function exit cleanly
