2010-11-16T11:06:58  <Error323> Imo after having changed the maps all the ratings should have been resetted
2010-11-16T11:07:22  <McLeopold> I think they'll merge to the correct spot
2010-11-16T11:07:26  <Error323> now there are ppl with such stable ratings slowly but surely dropping because of the new maps that their bots are less good at

2010-11-16T11:07:48  <McLeopold> It only uses 3 days of results, so it should be mostly new maps only.

2010-11-16T11:08:18  <Error323> the point is the players still have ratings from way before

2010-11-16T11:09:24  <Error323> are you saying that the history has no impact from before 3 days back?
2010-11-16T11:09:30  <Error323> because I think it does

2010-11-16T11:09:48  <lavalamp_> I could be wrong but at least my misinformation comes from the best source
2010-11-16T11:10:05  <McLeopold> Yes, janzert said 3 days.
2010-11-16T11:10:06  <Error323> then why keep the history in the first place
2010-11-16T11:10:11  <Error323> doesn't make sense
2010-11-16T11:10:17  <McLeopold> So you can review your past matches
2010-11-16T11:10:38  <McLeopold> The issue is, it takes too long to process the scores.
2010-11-16T11:11:02  <McLeopold> With BayesElo, you always process the entire batch from scratch.
2010-11-16T11:11:30  <Error323> I fear that people resubmitting now for the first time in > 10 days are in for a scare

2010-11-16T11:21:19  <McLeopold> Because we hated the party of the last guy 2 years ago.
2010-11-16T11:21:23  <lavalamp_> It's a whole-history method, not an incremental method

2010-11-16T11:22:14  <lavalamp_> if you only plug three days of games into it, you'll only be rated on those three days

2010-11-16T11:24:37  <Error323> let say contestant X is rated 20th and has a history with its latest submission of 1000 games. He submitted 20 days before the maps changed. 20 days later the maps changed and because of his massive history his rating is very stable resulting in very slow decrease of his rating. Whilest when he would resubmit, the true problem would show up as he wouldn't come anywhere near his old ranking.

2010-11-16T11:25:42  <Error323> My point is everyones score should have been completely resetted (as if they all resubmitted) when the server maps had changed.
2010-11-16T11:25:47  <lavalamp_> AFAIK, bayeselo doesn't carry over stability info like that; you are rated solely on the games it's given
2010-11-16T11:26:07  <lavalamp_> it's as if everyone submitted their bot three days ago
2010-11-16T11:26:25  <Error323> well thats not true, bayeselo holds a history
2010-11-16T11:26:33  <lavalamp_> only for the games you feed it
2010-11-16T11:26:37  <Error323> losing 10 times of X is very different from losing 1 time of X
2010-11-16T11:26:47  <lavalamp_> right
2010-11-16T11:27:08  <lavalamp_> it forgets everything between rating runs though. That's why you have to give it all the games at once.
2010-11-16T11:28:25  <lavalamp_> I could be thinking of another rating algorithm but I'm pretty sure I'm not

2010-11-16T12:25:32  <Error323> now i understand :P
2010-11-16T12:25:36  <lavalamp_> haha ok
2010-11-16T12:27:12  <Error323> thats very weird though
2010-11-16T12:27:35  <Error323> only a few games are played for a contestant in 3 days
2010-11-16T12:28:18  <Error323> lavalamp_: are you sure thats the case?
2010-11-16T12:28:26  <lavalamp_> when I left mine running it got quite a few

2010-11-16T12:28:46  <lavalamp_> it seemed to play like one an hour or so
2010-11-16T12:29:16  <Error323> yes well thats like 72 games
2010-11-16T12:29:19  <lavalamp_> hm, Error323 if my bot were a little brighter it should have won this I think:

2010-11-16T12:29:49  <lavalamp_> if you're arguing not enough games are played for accurate ratings, I agree ^^

2010-11-16T12:30:39  <Error323> :(
2010-11-16T12:31:15  <lavalamp_> it probably depends on the level of the program to some extent
2010-11-16T12:31:40  <lavalamp_> my first submission bounced between place 120 and 270-- that's incredibly innacurate
2010-11-16T12:31:41  <Error323> no but seriously
2010-11-16T12:31:48  <Error323> the variety in the maps is so big now
2010-11-16T12:32:05  <Error323> that 3 days of play is not enough for accurate ratings

2010-11-16T12:32:38  <lavalamp_> I totally agree, and further, it wasn't before the new maps, either
2010-11-16T12:33:02  <Error323> no... but probably less of a problem
2010-11-16T12:33:35  <Error323> devs?
2010-11-16T12:33:44  <lavalamp_> you can double check with janzert but I'm 95% sure what I'm saying is correct
2010-11-16T12:33:58  <lavalamp_> or amstan
2010-11-16T12:34:02  <Error323> amstan: ping
2010-11-16T12:35:14  <Error323> well i hope i'm missing something
2010-11-16T12:35:25  <Error323> but from the looks of the dropping of some players I'm not sure
2010-11-16T12:36:07  <lavalamp_> awesome, my bot is so much better at close positions now: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1055535

2010-11-16T12:42:48  <Error323> mine is failing more each day
2010-11-16T12:42:49  <Error323> :/
2010-11-16T12:44:05  <medrimonia> Mine too, I'm making a big work, but I just can hope that I'll finish it before the deadline
2010-11-16T12:45:21  <lavalamp_> I have a lot left to do still, I'm worried I won't have much time to do any tuning once I get it all written :/
2010-11-16T12:49:39  <Error323> i'm having a crisis in wether to pursue my new approach
2010-11-16T12:49:46  <Error323> or optimize/tweak my old
2010-11-16T12:50:17  <Error323> new approach is more risk with higher payoff
2010-11-16T12:50:23  <Error323> old is less payoff less risk
2010-11-16T12:50:25  <Error323> :P

2010-11-16T12:53:49  <bhasker> oh i am just trying out new stuff
2010-11-16T12:53:55  <Error323> ah ok
2010-11-16T12:53:57  <bhasker> changed the routing logic
2010-11-16T12:54:04  <bhasker> so it doesn't do the fly past stuff
2010-11-16T12:54:11  <bhasker> but its doing other stuff that isn't correct
2010-11-16T12:54:54  <Error323> i see
2010-11-16T12:55:04  <Error323> well i really need to update my attacking system
2010-11-16T12:55:08  <Error323> cuz its teh suck atm
2010-11-16T12:55:24  <lavalamp_> not as bad as my defense, I'm sure

2010-11-16T12:57:38  <bhasker> the new routing doesn't fly past my planets
2010-11-16T12:57:38  <Error323> i wish i could predict with how much to attack an enemy planet better without heavily overestimating
2010-11-16T12:57:51  <bhasker> error i wish i could do the same
2010-11-16T12:58:00  <bhasker> but i can't get the math right for that:-\
2010-11-16T12:58:14  <Error323> thats because its not just math
2010-11-16T12:58:27  <Error323> but highly dependent on the enemy's behavior
2010-11-16T12:58:51  <Error323> nice work on the routing though, looking more like mine now :>
2010-11-16T12:59:11  <Error323> I like looking at routing :P
2010-11-16T12:59:23  <Error323> i'm going mental over this game
2010-11-16T12:59:34  <bhasker> lol
2010-11-16T12:59:42  <Error323> ^_^
2010-11-16T13:00:33  <bhasker> i fixed my state udpation code, now takes 2 ms to update all 23 planets
2010-11-16T13:00:43  <bhasker> and do all the fleet resolution for all planets
2010-11-16T13:01:04  <Error323> cool, your approach is the complement of mine
2010-11-16T13:01:09  <Error323> xD
2010-11-16T13:01:12  <bhasker> heh
2010-11-16T13:01:28  <Error323> though for some stuff urs make more sense
2010-11-16T13:01:38  <Error323> like fleetrequests or sth
2010-11-16T13:01:56  <bhasker> this bogusbrainpower keeps killing my bot
2010-11-16T13:04:47  <Error323> lavalamp_: did you last stated that taking the average was a pretty good eval function?
2010-11-16T13:07:59  <bhasker> average of what?
2010-11-16T13:08:22  <Error323> that would be my question

2010-11-16T13:18:55  <bhasker> i am getting tired of this bogusbrainpower bot
2010-11-16T13:35:33  <lavalamp_> Error323: average ships count * average production (over the next max distance turns)
2010-11-16T13:36:01  <lavalamp_> that's a large part of my eval function right now and it's surprisingly hard to improve on
2010-11-16T13:36:50  <d0ugal> Zannick: Sorry, was away - filing a bug now.
2010-11-16T13:36:51  <Error323> lavalamp_: average over what?
2010-11-16T13:37:32  <lavalamp_> from the current turn until [max distance on the board] turns from now
2010-11-16T13:37:33  <Error323> planets?
2010-11-16T13:37:38  <Error323> ohhh
2010-11-16T13:37:39  <lavalamp_> sorry yes
2010-11-16T13:37:42  <Error323> over time
2010-11-16T13:37:43  <Error323> ?
2010-11-16T13:37:46  <lavalamp_> yeah
2010-11-16T13:37:51  <lavalamp_> all my planets over time
2010-11-16T13:38:36  <Error323> mmm
2010-11-16T13:38:40  <Error323> makes sense i guess
2010-11-16T13:39:12  <Error323> but why only the furthest
2010-11-16T13:39:17  <Error323> or max distance
2010-11-16T13:39:35  <lavalamp_> actually I used 20 and just changed it to max distance this morning
2010-11-16T13:39:57  <lavalamp_> I do know if I use max distance *2 it's horrible
2010-11-16T13:41:51  <lavalamp_> I need to do more experimentation to figure out what is actually going on
2010-11-16T13:42:00  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-16T13:42:12  <Error323> I don't have an explanation for it
2010-11-16T13:42:13  <lavalamp_> there's some more in my eval, now, too--
2010-11-16T13:42:15  <Error323> but i'll try it out
2010-11-16T13:42:20  <Error323> see if it works here as well
2010-11-16T13:42:56  <lavalamp_> For example, I don't include planets that I think ragebot could take
2010-11-16T13:43:05  <d0ugal> Zannick and anybody else it concerns: Issue can be found here; http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=211
2010-11-16T13:43:52  <lavalamp_> I also have a connectedness metric, positions score better if their planets are more cohesive
2010-11-16T13:44:12  <Error323> ah
2010-11-16T13:44:22  <lavalamp_> if it gets near the end of the game I switch to just using ship count at the last turn
2010-11-16T13:44:52  <Error323> yeah its already becomming more hary :P
2010-11-16T13:44:58  <lavalamp_> but the connectedness thing doesn't really do much
2010-11-16T13:45:01  <lavalamp_> haha
2010-11-16T13:45:25  <lavalamp_> some of what I have is band-aids to fix problems that should be fixed other ways

2010-11-16T13:46:33  <lavalamp_> lesson being: if your bot doesn't know how to fortify/defend itself, you can't fix that with an eval function
2010-11-16T13:49:40  <lavalamp_> because the eval function won't notice a planet is vulnerable until it actually gets taken

2010-11-16T13:52:10  <lavalamp_> I will probably remove the connectedness thing unless I can show it does something useful
2010-11-16T13:57:45  <lavalamp_> yay my bot is climbing back up on official now that I have a new version... disastrous upload yesterday, ugh
2010-11-16T13:58:33  <Error323> whats ur unofficial rank?

2010-11-16T13:59:47  <lavalamp_> I was in the 500's before I killed it yesterday
2010-11-16T13:59:57  <lavalamp_> shot down to 1500
2010-11-16T14:00:03  <Error323> ouch
2010-11-16T14:00:03  <lavalamp_> now it's back to 600

2010-11-16T14:02:26  <lavalamp_> -150 on tcp right now but who knows what that means, tcp is brutal lately
2010-11-16T14:02:39  <Error323> true that

2010-11-16T15:01:47  <lavalamp_> currently my code is pretty focused on expansion, if yours isn't maybe that's the difference

2010-11-16T15:02:06  <Mistmanov> really weird bug somewhere in my defensive routine causes that.. just have to track it down (first time I've it happening)
2010-11-16T15:02:14  <lavalamp_> it's also possible that yours was way better than mine already ^^
2010-11-16T15:02:18  <Error323> thats insande =)
2010-11-16T15:02:21  <Error323> insane*
2010-11-16T15:02:49  <Mistmanov> having 3x as many ships, more production, and still managing to lose

2010-11-16T15:06:44  <Error323> holy crap
2010-11-16T15:07:02  <McLeopold> Once dmj111 and mega1 start playing, they'll have some meaning
2010-11-16T15:07:17  <Error323> McLeopold: but could you solely generate maps using http://tinyurl.com/aimapgen
2010-11-16T15:07:27  <Error323> then i'll get on it for sure
2010-11-16T15:07:27  <McLeopold> Accoun is #12 right now on official, so that has some meaning.

2010-11-16T15:08:32  <Error323> its in the topic
2010-11-16T15:08:35  <Error323> it must be right?
2010-11-16T15:08:51  <Error323> just generate 500 maps or sth
2010-11-16T15:09:00  <Error323> no more experimental weirdness
2010-11-16T15:09:06  <Error323> cuz it says nothing to me
2010-11-16T15:09:17  <McLeopold> no, I removed those
2010-11-16T15:09:23  <McLeopold> I'll have a port just for fun later.
2010-11-16T15:09:26  <lavalamp_> McLeopold you used the updated script with the two changes right?
2010-11-16T15:09:30  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-16T15:09:40  <McLeopold> but the original 30 are still there
2010-11-16T15:09:45  <McLeopold> They still fit the spec
2010-11-16T15:10:09  <lavalamp_> yeah ok
2010-11-16T15:10:13  <McLeopold> Although, I don't like the circle shape instead of a square, personally.
2010-11-16T15:10:54  <Error323> men i need to change my attackscheme but i don't know how :/
2010-11-16T15:11:00  <lavalamp_> I thought I heard antimatroid say something about changing that

2010-11-16T15:16:06  <lavalamp_> it frustrates me that I have to hold back my expansion just to beat ragebot, even though no one good will play like ragebot. So I was thinking about making my bot play rage's moves sometimes on close maps just to keep people honest

2010-11-16T15:18:46  <Mistmanov> eh maps
2010-11-16T15:18:49  <JamesMG> the new maps broke my most recent code more than my older code
2010-11-16T15:19:01  <JamesMG> probably a good thing though

2010-11-16T16:27:19  <bhasker> if you are too aggressive against him
2010-11-16T16:27:20  <bhasker> you get owned
2010-11-16T16:29:25  <bhasker> E323 at top
2010-11-16T16:29:28  <McLeopold> nice
2010-11-16T16:29:58  <bhasker> with this asymmetrical maps its all  the more important not to go for disputed planets:-\
2010-11-16T16:30:03  <eburnette> lol that was quick
2010-11-16T16:30:06  <bhasker> i keep getting owned
2010-11-16T16:30:12  <bhasker> by going for wrong planets at start
2010-11-16T16:30:48  <eburnette> I think knapsack does not work on this type of map
2010-11-16T16:31:36  <eburnette> Is newmap27.txt valid?
2010-11-16T16:32:42  <lavalamp_> honestly I don't see how peolpe have gotten knapsack to work at all... do you factor in travel time?
2010-11-16T16:32:53  <eburnette> yeah
2010-11-16T16:32:58  <JamesMG> I have at various points lavalamp_
2010-11-16T16:33:08  <JamesMG> eburnette: I think it's valid, those planets are all 2 turns away, right?
2010-11-16T16:33:16  <eburnette> it helped my score a lot a couple of weeks ago
2010-11-16T16:33:30  <lavalamp_> do you factor in the ships that will be available the turn after you capture a new planet
2010-11-16T16:33:35  <lavalamp_> ?
2010-11-16T16:34:58  <eburnette> what do you count as 2 turns away? Launch on turn 3 and arrive on turn 4?
2010-11-16T16:35:41  <McLeopold> distance of 2.00 to 2.99999
2010-11-16T16:36:07  <JamesMG> talking about this game, right? http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=298
2010-11-16T16:36:36  <d0ugal> @tcp
2010-11-16T16:36:37  <contestbot> d0ugal: tcp = (#1) http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/, or (#2) http://72.44.46.68/, or (#3) http://zeroviz.us:8080, or (#4) 98.247.248.39:995 (zeroviz.us)
2010-11-16T16:36:48  <eburnette> JamesMG yes
2010-11-16T16:38:07  <JamesMG> I can't actually tell, now that you mention it.  would have to step through the game state
2010-11-16T16:38:14  <eburnette> profit[planet] = (horizon - distanceFromStarter) * dest.GrowthRate()) - attackSize
2010-11-16T16:39:05  <McLeopold> what's horizon?
2010-11-16T16:39:41  <eburnette> it varies
2010-11-16T16:40:03  <eburnette> JamesMG first command was "F 2 17 2 17 2 1 /  F 1 20 1 16 2 1"
2010-11-16T16:40:18  <eburnette> first state I mean, turn 1
2010-11-16T16:41:22  <lavalamp_> eburnette that map looks fine to me
2010-11-16T16:42:42  <eburnette> ok
2010-11-16T16:42:57  <lavalamp_> yay I'm at my highest official rating since the map change
2010-11-16T16:43:31  <JamesMG> I think my bot has settled in at 250th or so
2010-11-16T16:44:07  <lavalamp_> unlike my last one I should have plenty of ways to continue to improve after I get up there
2010-11-16T16:44:16  <Error323> wuut
2010-11-16T16:44:20  <Error323> i'm second \o/
2010-11-16T16:44:38  <Error323> McLeopold: why is the rank messed up btw?
2010-11-16T16:44:57  <McLeopold> how so
2010-11-16T16:45:19  <Error323> http://zeroviz.us:8080/ very weird countings
2010-11-16T16:45:31  <McLeopold> that's only the active bots
2010-11-16T16:45:32  <Error323> what does it mean
2010-11-16T16:45:36  <Error323> oh
2010-11-16T16:47:05  <McLeopold> better?
2010-11-16T16:47:06  <Mistmanov> ugh.. there I was, all proud that my bot scored a victory against the new player "bitterandtwisted"
2010-11-16T16:47:20  <Mistmanov> looked at the game and went "oh... ragebot in disguise >_<"
2010-11-16T16:48:53  <McLeopold> we gotta get george and iouri on zeroviz...
2010-11-16T16:49:15  <JamesMG> all the top 10
2010-11-16T16:49:15  <McLeopold> and flag
2010-11-16T16:49:25  <eburnette> what's the holdup on betting benzedrine updated?
2010-11-16T16:49:39  <McLeopold> and oldman, even though his bot enrages me
2010-11-16T16:49:47  <JamesMG> haha, I hear that
2010-11-16T16:49:47  <McLeopold> dunno, can't get ahold of dhartmei

2010-11-16T16:50:54  <Frontier> Does anyone know how openmp works? I just though it could be active by default in the current gcc releases and unroll loops on multiple cpu cores transparently. That could become an oversight on the server side some time and give c(++) programs an advantage. Or is there no need to worry?

2010-11-16T16:51:46  <Frontier> alright, thx for the info
2010-11-16T16:52:11  <eburnette> However the c compiler has options to do things with vectorization, not quite the same as multiple threads though
2010-11-16T16:53:38  <Frontier> it could use simd instructions, why not :)

2010-11-16T16:55:26  <bhasker> it just stopped at 168

2010-11-16T17:11:52  <Mistmanov> ok, so it wasn't an infinite loop.. but the problem has still been solved =)

2010-11-16T17:13:51  <d0ugal> Nice
2010-11-16T17:13:59  <Zannick> yeah, that map...
2010-11-16T17:14:21  <d0ugal> My bot is really bad on the maps that are that close
2010-11-16T17:14:30  <d0ugal> but then its poor compared to all you guys in general
2010-11-16T17:15:41  <McLeopold> so, try not to attack too far away
2010-11-16T17:16:00  <McLeopold> put a max distance on your attacking, and you'll do much better
2010-11-16T17:16:21  <McLeopold> There's probably a better way to go about that, but just try the easy way and see how you do.
2010-11-16T17:16:22  <d0ugal> McLeopold: Yeah, I'm just workin on that part
2010-11-16T17:16:55  <d0ugal> It's a total re-write, I only got it to a point where it finished a game two days ago, so plenty of tweaking to do
2010-11-16T17:17:08  <McLeopold> cool
2010-11-16T17:17:23  <d0ugal> Need to update the fitness function to give the distance more of a negative value

2010-11-16T17:21:08  <eburnette> Darn, I forgot to add if (stupid(move)) break;
2010-11-16T17:21:12  <Error323> McLeopold: how are  you determining when players have disconnected?
2010-11-16T17:21:25  <Error323> i mean, to refresh the list
2010-11-16T17:21:28  <McLeopold> That part is dhartmei's code
2010-11-16T17:21:43  <Error323> oh
2010-11-16T17:21:48  <Error323> cuz tcp ain't doing that
2010-11-16T17:22:43  <McLeopold> if the tcp connection is closed
2010-11-16T17:22:56  <McLeopold> tcp is a stateful connection
2010-11-16T17:23:04  <McLeopold> so your end needs to not hang up
2010-11-16T17:25:32  <Error323> men
2010-11-16T17:25:54  <Error323> i wonder if the dev team truely realized how much they changed the game with the new mapgen
2010-11-16T17:26:01  <Error323> and how many ppl they pissed off
2010-11-16T17:26:20  <Mistmanov> who says there aren't any women here -_-
2010-11-16T17:26:37  <McLeopold> I think they don't care, since technically it's still within the original specs.
2010-11-16T17:26:38  <Mistmanov> but yeah.. the dev team itself isn't developing any bots?

2010-11-16T17:26:47  <JamesMG> McLeopold: any chance you could put a newline between player names and shipcount/growth?
2010-11-16T17:26:51  <bhasker> lol http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=496
2010-11-16T17:26:54  <JamesMG> on the canvas page
2010-11-16T17:26:59  <Mistmanov> that may influence their perspective on how they see changes to the rules
2010-11-16T17:27:02  <Zannick> i think the biggest problem with the new mapgen is that somehow a lot of the maps have very close planets that the visualizer overlaps
2010-11-16T17:27:13  <McLeopold> JamesMG: I'll try
2010-11-16T17:27:23  <McLeopold> tired of the wiggle?
2010-11-16T17:27:27  <JamesMG> yup
2010-11-16T17:27:41  <McLeopold> Zannick: I think there is a bias in the new generator
2010-11-16T17:27:51  <McLeopold> for planets to be closer to center
2010-11-16T17:28:12  <McLeopold> it's the whole sqrt() thing for radius, instead of log()
2010-11-16T17:28:35  <Zannick> hm
2010-11-16T17:29:00  <Zannick> that should weight it higher, though
2010-11-16T17:29:18  <Zannick> log(random.random()) would make it negative
2010-11-16T17:29:38  <lavalamp_> I don't understand why it does the generation in polar coords
2010-11-16T17:29:45  <McLeopold> log( random( 1 to 4) , 2)
2010-11-16T17:29:59  <McLeopold> yeah, that's kinda a waste to
2010-11-16T17:30:18  <Zannick> the radius is generated by sqrt( uniform[0,1) )
2010-11-16T17:30:26  <Zannick> times max and whatnot
2010-11-16T17:30:40  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-16T17:30:51  <Zannick> the generation is in polar to get the symmetry more easily
2010-11-16T17:31:09  <McLeopold> you don't need polar for symmetry
2010-11-16T17:31:35  <McLeopold> generate x and y
2010-11-16T17:31:46  <Zannick> no you don't, but for arbitrary angle reflective symmetry it's easier
2010-11-16T17:31:47  <lavalamp_> ... it's possible to convert one to the other
2010-11-16T17:31:48  <McLeopold> for point symmetry, use -x and -y
2010-11-16T17:32:00  <McLeopold> for line symmetry, use -x, y   or  x, -y
2010-11-16T17:32:00  <Zannick> line symmetry, i mean
2010-11-16T17:32:24  <McLeopold> rotate afterwards if you need it to be astetically pleasing
2010-11-16T17:32:37  <lavalamp_> even for line symmetry  you can convert x,y to r,theta
2010-11-16T17:32:43  <eburnette> whoohoo
2010-11-16T17:32:44  <McLeopold> and translate to positive coords
2010-11-16T17:32:58  <Zannick> i agree, though, the distribution is making planets much closer
2010-11-16T17:33:26  <lavalamp_> there's also more planets now though, so you have to expect it to be denser
2010-11-16T17:33:31  <McLeopold> the other thing is, I think the old generator staying in a square shape, the new one is in a circle shape
2010-11-16T17:33:42  <lavalamp_> yes that is true
2010-11-16T17:33:46  <Zannick> yes
2010-11-16T17:33:57  <McLeopold> but if you don't hit large radii, it doesn't matter
2010-11-16T17:34:17  <Zannick> that removes less than a quarter of the original space
2010-11-16T17:34:32  <McLeopold> for radius 12, yes
2010-11-16T17:34:43  <McLeopold> but he want's to bump it up to 17, so more space
2010-11-16T17:34:46  <Zannick> it should hit large radii, though, it's less likely to hit small radii
2010-11-16T17:34:59  <McLeopold> Zannick, it should be even
2010-11-16T17:35:17  <Zannick> it should be that every point be as likely as before
2010-11-16T17:35:25  <McLeopold> radius 2 *should* have twice the probability, if he used log
2010-11-16T17:35:28  <Zannick> or at least balance
2010-11-16T17:36:47  <Zannick> probability of exact numbers are hard to specify
2010-11-16T17:37:16  <McLeopold> well, the circumference of radius 2 is twice radius 1
2010-11-16T17:37:33  <Zannick> yes, and the radius is a randomly selected "real"
2010-11-16T17:37:46  <Zannick> so yes, twice 0 is 0 :P
2010-11-16T17:37:51  <McLeopold> ?
2010-11-16T17:38:16  <Zannick> what's the probability a random real number between 0 and 12 is exactly 1?
2010-11-16T17:38:38  <McLeopold> very small
2010-11-16T17:38:39  <McLeopold> but
2010-11-16T17:38:56  <amstan_> ugh... a bunch of crybabies
2010-11-16T17:39:00  <McLeopold> what's the probability that it is closer to 1 than 2?
2010-11-16T17:39:02  <amstan_> now transforming in a flame war
2010-11-16T17:39:07  <amstan_> perhaps i should lock that topic

2010-11-16T17:39:25  <Zannick> he's talking about the forum
2010-11-16T17:39:33  <McLeopold> amstan: I think there is a bais in the map generator, which should be fixed

2010-11-16T17:47:32  <amstan_> it's really depressing
2010-11-16T17:47:56  <Error323> but you have to understand that the mapchange had a massive impact on some ppl's time which is easily just as frustrating

2010-11-16T17:51:17  <Error323> amstan_: on a different topic, is it true that the elo rating has a history knowledge of only 3 days?
2010-11-16T17:51:19  <Zannick> okay, that looks like a serious issue with generating theta...

2010-11-16T17:54:24  <Error323> so am i
2010-11-16T17:54:26  <amstan_> thanks
2010-11-16T17:54:27  <lavalamp_> I'm not sure if I'm having fun or am obsessed... but thanks for running it
2010-11-16T17:54:33  <Mistmanov> =) a little difference of opinion over some aspects of the contests shouldn't overshadow the overall experience =)
2010-11-16T17:54:44  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-16T17:55:26  <Error323> damnit dmj111 I hate you
2010-11-16T17:55:36  <Error323> your attacks are scary
2010-11-16T17:56:20  <McLeopold> Actually, all the people ranting about how unprofessional this is, is really a testament to how close this is to really being professional.
2010-11-16T17:56:41  <amstan_> McLeopold: hmm?
2010-11-16T17:56:53  <McLeopold> Kinda like only being critical of things you care about.
2010-11-16T17:57:28  <Zannick> antimatroid: there seem to be problems with distances http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=558
2010-11-16T17:57:57  <McLeopold> Zannick: that map is totally within spec
2010-11-16T17:58:10  <dmj111> Error323: that hurts :)
2010-11-16T17:58:20  <Error323> ;)
2010-11-16T17:58:23  <Zannick> or random numbers
2010-11-16T17:58:32  <mega1> amstan_: which topic is that?
2010-11-16T17:58:35  <JamesMG> that map/game is kind of awesome actually
2010-11-16T17:58:38  <JamesMG> 558 I mean
2010-11-16T17:58:47  <JamesMG> round robin and brutally short
2010-11-16T17:58:47  <Zannick> McLeopold: when i see a lot of those maps, i suspect a problem is occurring

2010-11-16T18:01:59  <mega1> yes, when the new version settles down
2010-11-16T18:02:08  <amstan_> why do you guys use the ip address directly? wouldn't the hostname be more flexible?
2010-11-16T18:02:13  <mega1> maybe in about 5-6 hours
2010-11-16T18:02:22  <mega1> amstan_: doesn't work for some reason
2010-11-16T18:02:31  <amstan_> weird
2010-11-16T18:02:35  <mega1> maybe the client doesn't look it up properly
2010-11-16T18:03:08  <eburnette> Somebody's home computer using dyndns maybe?
2010-11-16T18:04:17  <amstan_> i noticed McLeopold changing the ip in the contestbot factoid
2010-11-16T18:05:05  <McLeopold> after the power outage, I got a new ip
2010-11-16T18:05:16  <McLeopold> dns has to propogate throughout the world now
2010-11-16T18:05:57  <iamluck> McLeopold: change TTL of your DNS, if you can, in case it happens again :)
2010-11-16T18:05:59  <McLeopold> mega1: it's working now
2010-11-16T18:06:05  <McLeopold> what to?
2010-11-16T18:06:19  <McLeopold> I think it's a 2 hours?
2010-11-16T18:06:21  <iamluck> 60 minutes? how low can you go?
2010-11-16T18:06:56  <McLeopold> 2 mintues
2010-11-16T18:07:42  <iamluck> Then after this change there shouldn't be many issues with "dns has to propogate throughout the world now"

2010-11-16T18:08:57  <Zannick> yeah, i'm tempted to rewrite the coordinate generation in the map generator
2010-11-16T18:09:15  <Zannick> so that each point is equally likely
2010-11-16T18:09:17  <amstan_> #topic add Turn count WILL stay at 200!
2010-11-16T18:09:22  <sigh> what's wrong with the coordinate generation?

2010-11-16T18:09:27  <McLeopold> yeah!
2010-11-16T18:09:30  <McLeopold> a decision!
2010-11-16T18:10:03  <mega1> Zannick: does it generate angles and distances uniformly or what?
2010-11-16T18:10:05  <sigh> 200! is a bit high, imo
2010-11-16T18:10:10  <Zannick> the change in generating points by radius and theta seems to be throwing something off
2010-11-16T18:10:15  <amstan_> sigh: shut up, lol

2010-11-16T18:13:58  <dmj111> Zannick: i think that would be a good change.
2010-11-16T18:14:13  <mega1> Error323: just a more combative way of saying that I'm not in agreement.
2010-11-16T18:14:46  <dmj111> eburnette: my bot is, and might always be, a chicken.

2010-11-16T18:17:31  <mega1> McLeopold: I'm at work and testing new stuff too locally.
2010-11-16T18:17:36  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3655), oldman(3564), GreenTea(3497), davidjliu(3493), bix0r4ever(3484), protocolocon(3472), shangas(3450), _iouri_(3442), dmj111(3441), george(3424)
2010-11-16T18:17:53  <McLeopold> okay, just send me your old code and I'll get it up and running for you
2010-11-16T18:18:33  <mega1> I have very promising local tests.
2010-11-16T18:18:41  <antimatroid> i've had a read up above
2010-11-16T18:18:54  <McLeopold> use log!
2010-11-16T18:18:58  <antimatroid> 2 things, 1. they would be significantly more bunched up atm, the map size is tinier
2010-11-16T18:19:05  <McLeopold> ..was my opinion
2010-11-16T18:19:14  <antimatroid> seconly log(0,1) is between -inf and 0 or whatever
2010-11-16T18:19:14  <mega1> maybe I can catch up with the map changes after several days of hacking
2010-11-16T18:19:25  <antimatroid> secondly, using sqrt is meant to give uniform distribution inside the circle
2010-11-16T18:19:28  <antimatroid> on average
2010-11-16T18:19:44  <mega1> "uniform on average"
2010-11-16T18:19:46  <mega1> ?
2010-11-16T18:20:00  <McLeopold> Yeah, but this is math, and I can prove you wrong.
2010-11-16T18:20:20  <antimatroid> we did ask the #math channel :\
2010-11-16T18:20:25  <mega1> ah, just a terminology confusion
2010-11-16T18:20:35  <McLeopold> :)
2010-11-16T18:20:44  <McLeopold> seriously, do you want a graph?
2010-11-16T18:21:20  <Error323> mega1: if you got a new bot, make sure to run it at McLeopold 's server, the old tcp has obsolete maps and will rate you wrong
2010-11-16T18:21:31  *** nullkuhl <nullkuhl!~nullkuhl@196.221.227.142> has joined #aichallenge

2010-11-16T18:21:43  <mega1> Error323: I'll run at both
2010-11-16T18:21:59  <Error323> McLeopold: they will be that off hehe
2010-11-16T18:22:04  <mega1> they are significantly different
2010-11-16T18:22:04  <McLeopold> ( Little does everyone know that they are feeding my neutral net.  Bwahaha! )
2010-11-16T18:22:16  <Error323> how come ppl don't see how a massive impact those maps have on bots o_O
2010-11-16T18:22:20  <mega1> neutral net is a new concept
2010-11-16T18:22:32  <Zannick> naw, net neutrality has existed for a while
2010-11-16T18:22:43  <McLeopold> not for long...
2010-11-16T18:22:47  <Error323> lol neutral net :P
2010-11-16T18:22:52  <antimatroid> i love it how people say the rules just need to be clear about 200 turn limit so people don't get an advantage from guessing the rules
2010-11-16T18:23:00  <antimatroid> yet half of those people are bitching like crazy about the map change
2010-11-16T18:23:07  <JamesMG> if you needed to run a TCP server to feed a neural net I wouldn't be too worried about it
2010-11-16T18:23:22  <Zannick> to be honest my bot assumes the game will end on a multiple of 50...
2010-11-16T18:23:30  <mega1> Error323: maybe they have more basic problems
2010-11-16T18:23:31  <Error323> antimatroid: i'm not bitching, just stating facts
2010-11-16T18:23:51  <antimatroid> Error323: the old maps were never a rule
2010-11-16T18:24:05  <antimatroid> to now use them allows people who guessed they would be used to have that same advantage people are talking about
2010-11-16T18:24:21  <Error323> doesn't matter antimatroid, its what the server has been running for all these months
2010-11-16T18:24:24  <antimatroid> but i've been over that, i was just pointing out peoples double argumets :)
2010-11-16T18:24:27  <Error323> ppl overfit on them, it happens
2010-11-16T18:24:28  <Zannick> we could tell people that if they're unhappy with the change we'll refund their money
2010-11-16T18:24:31  <Zannick> ;)
2010-11-16T18:24:44  <mega1> I have many ideas, but until the more serious problems are fixed it's impossible to gauge their worth.

2010-11-16T18:26:06  <antimatroid> i don't think i'm going to like future contests as much, it looks like people will be demanding genetors be set in stone early so they can gear their "bots" to work on very specific kinds of maps
2010-11-16T18:27:02  <JamesMG> maybe make it a facet of the competition that generators can and will change
2010-11-16T18:27:11  <JamesMG> makes the "AI" aspect of it more interesting anyways
2010-11-16T18:27:24  <iamluck> antimatroid: then make the map generator not very specific to begin with? :)
2010-11-16T18:27:29  <mega1> antimatroid: then make the generator general enough
2010-11-16T18:27:37  <Zannick> no, we'll set in stone the qualities of the map
2010-11-16T18:27:43  <Zannick> not the generator

2010-11-16T18:28:22  <antimatroid> iamluck: it wasn't ever stated to be an official generator :P
2010-11-16T18:28:25  <antimatroid> re read the specs
2010-11-16T18:28:38  <Error323> its all ppl had
2010-11-16T18:28:52  <antimatroid> yes, it says make your own test maps
2010-11-16T18:29:08  <mega1> the right way is to make a general enough generator
2010-11-16T18:29:18  <Error323> yes

2010-11-16T18:29:29  <Zannick> the right way is to make three generators and release them over time
2010-11-16T18:29:33  <iamluck> I'm not trying to argue, it is what it is... Why not then create the generator that makes these maps from the get go? ;) You have to agree if we had line symmetrical maps from the get go we wouldn't be having this argument.
2010-11-16T18:30:01  <antimatroid> the first generator was never meant to last that long, nobody else made a suitable new one
2010-11-16T18:30:02  <antimatroid> so i did
2010-11-16T18:30:13  <antimatroid> i had been waiting for it to change, but couldn't do anything due to exams
2010-11-16T18:30:26  <Error323> thats not the point =)
2010-11-16T18:30:59  <antimatroid> my point is if people wanted clearer rules about maps they should have done something themselves, not made assumptions :P
2010-11-16T18:31:17  <mega1> like ask for clarification?
2010-11-16T18:31:30  <Error323> antimatroid: ugh your quite stubborn :P
2010-11-16T18:31:37  <antimatroid> i am :)
2010-11-16T18:31:44  <Error323> look, the point is not us creating our own generator or sth
2010-11-16T18:31:54  <Error323> we can *ONLY* test on official or tcp
2010-11-16T18:32:00  <antimatroid> mega1: that was bad yes, not my fault, and no answer doesn't mean go and make assumptions
2010-11-16T18:32:13  <amstan_> btw... i posted something about the next contest on the mailing list, anyone want to read it?
2010-11-16T18:32:16  <Error323> so our own generators would be worth *NOTHING*
2010-11-16T18:32:22  <Zannick> most people probably won't read everything anyway
2010-11-16T18:32:23  <antimatroid> amstan: brb
2010-11-16T18:32:45  <mega1> what you still cannot appreciate that there is no way to avoid assumptions

2010-11-16T18:34:25  <antimatroid> amstan: I think the most important fixes needed are rules being VERY clear at the start of the contest, like maximum dimensions of maps etc.

2010-11-16T18:34:53  <antimatroid> general is fine, in fact I prefer it, but they need to be clear, and if the rules are general, they have to be followed that generally in the final contest, so people who made assumptions get no advantage
2010-11-16T18:35:00  <amstan> antimatroid: that's more related to the actual game, i'm interested in the code and framework

2010-11-16T18:45:07  <antimatroid> while I would be down for an n-player ai contest, realise that as soon as players increases, it's a completely different game as coalitions become important
2010-11-16T18:45:08  <amstan> antimatroid: well.. it is
2010-11-16T18:45:09  <amstan> lol
2010-11-16T18:45:16  <iamluck> I was considering setting up the TCP server on something like Google App Engine before. Ofcourse, tcp.exe would have to change... Not sure how feasible that is :)  Google would be a sponsor then!

2010-11-16T19:35:05  <Zannick> smaller space + same number of planets (or more) = closer planets, greater probability of "overlapping" planets

2010-11-16T19:36:50  <Zannick> it shouldn't

2010-11-16T19:37:08  <McLeopold> I guess it depends on the bot's style.

2010-11-16T19:51:41  <antimatroid> sigh: no offense :P
2010-11-16T19:51:45  <Mjothitnir> oh, so they are still the newmaps (528) and not the newnewmaps(526?+)
2010-11-16T19:51:57  <Mjothitnir> 536?+
2010-11-16T19:52:17  <sigh> antimatroid: I don't think my bot is going to get much better, anyway :P
2010-11-16T19:52:23  <mega1> Mjothitnir: is that a sarcastic version number?
2010-11-16T19:53:47  <Mjothitnir> the newmaps were "map_r528_#.txt" and the generator I was pointed to is "536" so the "?+" was allowing for future revisions . . . so hmm, I guess that could be considered sarcatic. :)
2010-11-16T19:54:59  <Mjothitnir> Oh crap gotta run

2010-11-16T20:07:10  <lavalamp_> eburnette: thanks :)
2010-11-16T20:07:10  <eburnette> Not sure I should be proud of this or not: You WIN against rangzen-stupid2.1
2010-11-16T20:08:55  <eburnette> quick poll: on point symmetric map: going for the central planet very early  - good or bad?
2010-11-16T20:09:12  <McLeopold> depends
2010-11-16T20:09:30  <lavalamp_> RPS
2010-11-16T20:09:30  <McLeopold> 0 growth 100 ships or 5 growth 1 ship?
2010-11-16T20:10:12  <McLeopold> I prefer lurking near the center waiting to snipe...
2010-11-16T20:10:14  <eburnette> how about 3 growth 4 ships
2010-11-16T20:10:39  <McLeopold> hmm...  Where's the growth 5 planets, near or far?
2010-11-16T20:10:45  <McLeopold> still depends
2010-11-16T20:11:03  <McLeopold> but it is more attractive now
2010-11-16T20:11:14  <eburnette> http://98.247.248.39:8080/canvas?game_id=931
2010-11-16T20:11:18  <antimatroid> yeah, depends on your distance to it and the enemies
2010-11-16T20:11:29  <McLeopold> totaly worth it
2010-11-16T20:12:05  <eburnette> why?
2010-11-16T20:12:24  <McLeopold> it's the jump point between the two sides...
2010-11-16T20:12:38  <McLeopold> It's probably the planet that will decide who has more growth...
2010-11-16T20:13:03  <McLeopold> Just go for the 21 and 12 near you first, then hold the center
2010-11-16T20:14:47  <McLeopold> you have a lot of disconnects
2010-11-16T20:15:07  <eburnette> disconnects?
2010-11-16T20:15:20  <McLeopold> yeah, that game didn't go 200

2010-11-16T20:15:41  <eburnette> Oh, I was watching it and stopped it
2010-11-16T20:15:45  <McLeopold> okay
2010-11-16T20:15:56  <McLeopold> I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a server issue.

2010-11-16T20:23:48  <mega1> clearly, there is a significant difference
2010-11-16T20:25:05  <antimatroid> what bot is that against?
2010-11-16T20:25:21  <antimatroid> or is this on the server?
2010-11-16T20:26:54  <mega1> my new creation against my old bot
2010-11-16T20:27:25  <mega1> I'll investigate a bit more later.
2010-11-16T20:27:54  <mega1> the difference is basically that 25 wins turned into draws
2010-11-16T20:28:20  <antimatroid> so what's making the planets more drawish?
2010-11-16T20:28:21  <mega1> may not necessarily mean much because the bots are similar
2010-11-16T20:28:43  <antimatroid> there's 2 reasons i could think of
2010-11-16T20:28:48  <mega1> no idea yet, don't have the time now to look at the individual matches
2010-11-16T20:29:13  <antimatroid> 1. larger distances make first moves a bit easier
2010-11-16T20:29:13  <antimatroid> 2. larger distances make planets more likely to be snipable?
2010-11-16T20:29:15  <antimatroid> those are just guesses
2010-11-16T20:29:17  <davidjliu> .............uhoh, I'm scared

2010-11-16T20:31:08  <mega1> I'd bet on 1
2010-11-16T20:31:54  <antimatroid> the only person i would have beat you is me :P
2010-11-16T20:31:58  <antimatroid> otherwise i'm rooting for you
2010-11-16T20:36:01  <bhasker> so i have a basic state evaluation function now
2010-11-16T20:36:05  <bhasker> now to see if its stable
2010-11-16T20:36:05  <antimatroid> i'm amazed that george is still at 10th
2010-11-16T20:36:17  <bhasker> if i am losing i would expect it to constantly go down

2010-11-16T20:49:03  <eburnette> what's wrong with totalling growth?
2010-11-16T20:49:41  <Mjothitnir> nothing if that is what you thought you were totalling
2010-11-16T20:51:47  <Mjothitnir> um, I thought y'all were saying that the "radius" was 17 not 12...
2010-11-16T20:52:02  <antimatroid> Mjothitnir: it needs fixing on the main site
2010-11-16T20:52:25  <Mjothitnir> OK, so the "decision" is 17, but it hasn't been updated yet. ok.
2010-11-16T20:52:28  <antimatroid> the old "radius" of the map was 12, but it was square, giving a max distance of 34
2010-11-16T20:52:47  <antimatroid> whereas the new maps are generated inside a circle, so i carried over the old radius and not the max distance
2010-11-16T20:52:56  <antimatroid> but preserving the max distance is considered more important
2010-11-16T20:53:30  <burny> I'd same preserve the surface area probably, rather than max distance
2010-11-16T20:54:13  <burny> which would be a radius of 13.5
2010-11-16T20:54:40  <antimatroid> that would preserve max distance anyway
2010-11-16T20:54:51  <antimatroid> wait, no err
2010-11-16T20:54:53  <antimatroid> hmmm
2010-11-16T20:54:57  <burny> it would preserve average max distance
2010-11-16T20:55:21  <antimatroid> another option is to just throw out any points generated outside the original square
2010-11-16T20:55:49  <antimatroid> i don't see why it matters though game wise, and people seem to care most about changes to the generator
2010-11-16T20:56:28  <burny> I'm giving up on doing the math to win.. I'm going to just have a simple huristic on how good each planet is, and try to maximize my value - opponents value
2010-11-16T20:59:01  <eburnette> so what do you think makes a planet valuable?
2010-11-16T20:59:06  <burny> guessing it'll put me around 10th-2th place
2010-11-16T20:59:21  <burny> growth obviously.. primarily
2010-11-16T21:02:46  <lavalamp_> burny, what place are you now?

2010-11-16T22:00:25  <burny> the problem I expect to run into with my AI.. is going to be that it determins that stackign up 200ships beside a planet, is a real good idea, because it can attack that planet.. and that actually attackingthe planet isn't all that good of an idea
2010-11-16T22:01:53  <eburnette> Next contest there should be a '50 repeat moves = a draw' rule
2010-11-16T22:02:09  <antimatroid> my biggest problem is working out what ships i should save for potential enemy attacks
2010-11-16T22:02:21  <javagamer> How come my compiler didn't throw any errors when I had a function that was supposed to return something, but forgot the return statement?
2010-11-16T22:02:34  <burny> default return 0?
2010-11-16T22:03:48  <davidjliu> heh, apparently McLeopold is my bane
2010-11-16T22:03:50  <eburnette> Ok is there any way this game could have been won instead of drawn? http://98.247.248.39:8080/canvas?game_id=1231
2010-11-16T22:04:44  <davidjliu> wait one turn
2010-11-16T22:04:51  <davidjliu> and then go for the +4 that has 12 ships on it
2010-11-16T22:04:54  <davidjliu> (does it have 12 ships on it?)
2010-11-16T22:05:42  <davidjliu> specifically, if the enemy tries to take the 16 1-growth, you take the 12 with +4, and if he doesn't, then it'll be a draw
2010-11-16T22:06:24  <davidjliu> so it's still a draw, but in a different way...

2010-11-16T22:14:06  <lavalamp_> eburnette: I have games where 50 repeat moves is the right thing to do while I slowly drain away the other guys forces until my superior production gives me enough ships to take over

2010-11-16T22:48:45  <rebelxt_> i.e. visualizer is not showing some planets
2010-11-16T22:49:01  <lavalamp_> visualizer might be busted as they're made in a circle and not a square anymore...
2010-11-16T22:49:10  <lavalamp_> I'm not sure if that will be changed or no
2010-11-16T22:49:12  <rebelxt_> ahh ok. i think the issue is radius 17
2010-11-16T22:49:23  <lavalamp_> antimatroid probably knows more if he's around

2010-11-16T22:57:57  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: does this ring a bell?
2010-11-16T23:01:00  <antimatroid> rebelxt_: maps are generated in a circle of radius 17 around the origin, then translated so that all coordinates are positive
2010-11-16T23:01:08  <antimatroid> so they can happen above 34
2010-11-16T23:01:41  <antimatroid> how is the visualiser broken? some maps aren't displayed? then yeah the visualiser is giving a display area smaller than the new possible area
2010-11-16T23:01:47  <antimatroid> some planets**
2010-11-16T23:01:54  <lavalamp_> wait how does that math work
2010-11-16T23:02:08  <lavalamp_> oh positive and != 0
2010-11-16T23:02:17  <lavalamp_> is that what you mean?
2010-11-16T23:02:36  <rebelxt_> one thing to look into is to check if visualizer.js can handle such maps. danielvf's visualizer can't without a patch, and it appears that ai-contest is using a modified version of daniel's visualizer
2010-11-16T23:02:43  <pgpaskar> does the java visualizer work at all?
2010-11-16T23:02:55  <pgpaskar> just curious, that code is prehistoric and bad at this point.
2010-11-16T23:03:01  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: it's not showing some planets (cropping)
2010-11-16T23:03:33  <rebelxt_> pgpaskar: i don't even have java viz any more.. it's so bad
2010-11-16T23:03:43  <pgpaskar> yup
2010-11-16T23:04:19  <pgpaskar> it was hacked together by a moron (me) in a day based on someone elses' code (jeff's) and never maintained
2010-11-16T23:04:27  <pgpaskar> i call it the student development cycle
2010-11-16T23:04:56  <rebelxt_> oops ;-)
2010-11-16T23:05:38  <pgpaskar> meh
2010-11-16T23:05:49  <rebelxt_> let me put it this way: java viz served us well until more light weight options showed up
2010-11-16T23:05:49  <pgpaskar> so whats all this talk of map generator broken?
2010-11-16T23:06:07  <pgpaskar> Hey; I'll have you know that the java visualizer uses less resources and less memory than the canvas one
2010-11-16T23:06:20  <pgpaskar> That is, before jeff did something to the animation
2010-11-16T23:06:23  <pgpaskar> I'm not sure what it does now
2010-11-16T23:07:41  <rebelxt_> canvas viz is resource intensive.. but what's also important to me is start-up time (i.e. chrome + canvas viz)

2010-11-16T23:09:20  <rebelxt_> i understand. again, i did not mean to say java one is bad per se ;) there are so many options these days.. java, canvas, jbotmanager, albert's stl player etc
2010-11-16T23:09:41  <pgpaskar> oh I know its bad
2010-11-16T23:10:40  <pgpaskar> But those complaints were kind of geared toward java as a langauge and the jvm, it seemed, which is stereotyped as being slow and bulky when it really isn't /that/ slow and bulky

2010-11-16T23:15:47  <antimatroid> is there anything i'm meant to be worrying about atm? or some visualiers just aren't displaying all planets?

2010-11-16T23:19:12  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: i guess we just need to let janzert know there might be a problem with visualizer handling radius 17 maps.. worth looking into this so that we all don't get surprised if new R17 maps are used

2010-11-16T23:22:34  <sigh> eburnette: what depth and branching factor?
2010-11-16T23:22:44  <antimatroid> eburnette: are you just sending ships from your planets at the current point in time? or into the future?
2010-11-16T23:22:57  <antimatroid> and if the later, how are you handling players possibly rendering those moves useless?
2010-11-16T23:23:18  <antimatroid> i've decided to try and set it up so that i only actually need to send fleets from now at each layer but considers moves from all time points

2010-11-16T23:23:52  <sigh> ah ok, you've got a fairly small set
2010-11-16T23:25:23  <eburnette> and future moves. I try really hard to make future moves work but if they don't then I bail on the latter parts
2010-11-16T23:28:17  <eburnette> It's pretty when it works, it even does future moves from planets that aren't captured yet
2010-11-16T23:28:24  <antimatroid> the other thing that is hard is having them expand, but not trying to snipe their "potential expansions"
2010-11-16T23:28:40  <antimatroid> well, not with your actual moves anyway
2010-11-16T23:30:27  <rebelxt_> eburnette: cool. i just got this to work as well (scheduling fleets from to-be captured planets).. a minor boost
2010-11-16T23:31:23  <eburnette> If I could just get my evaluate function to reflect reality I could do much better.
2010-11-16T23:32:46  <rebelxt_> so tricky to take positional advantage into account..
2010-11-16T23:32:51  <McLeopold> rebelxt_: the visualizer handles radius just fine
2010-11-16T23:32:58  <McLeopold> radius 17 that is
2010-11-16T23:33:20  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: which viz are you using? danielvf's from github?
2010-11-16T23:33:32  <McLeopold> no, the one from ai-contest
2010-11-16T23:33:42  <McLeopold> danielvf's doesn't handle it

2010-11-16T23:35:05  <lavalamp_> antimatroid: i do the latter of your two options... my preditiction object recognizes and appropriately cancels conflicting orders
2010-11-16T23:35:34  <lavalamp_> ...and yes that was just as hard as it sounds...

2010-11-16T23:38:06  <antimatroid> so the player can re-evalutate entire moves dependent on what they do
2010-11-16T23:38:11  <lavalamp_> that's probably more efficient

2010-11-16T23:38:38  <antimatroid> that's the plan, and hopefully doesn't result in missing potential good moves just cause they fucked one way of doing it up
