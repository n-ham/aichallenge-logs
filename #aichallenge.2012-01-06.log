2012-01-06T09:15:53  <UncleVasya> yep, I tried to update my local repo of his code and found the fact there are no more Asteroids on github.
2012-01-06T09:16:10  <UncleVasya> Now I'm going to look at the aeriques one.
2012-01-06T09:16:30  <UncleVasya> I hope they will not dissapear in few days.
2012-01-06T09:16:54  <UncleVasya> I dont't knwo why. Maybe because aerique has more progress.
2012-01-06T09:17:02  <UncleVasya> *know
2012-01-06T09:18:16  <mcstar> check out aerique's repo
2012-01-06T09:26:24  <ahow984_> lol mcstar I won't be able to do this one :P :/ it's not too much like pathfinding after all, you need to find the number of different paths they can take :P
2012-01-06T09:27:57  <UncleVasya> number of different paths is a DP-problem, right?
2012-01-06T09:28:17  <ahow984_> I don't know what a DP-Problem is, but don't tell me
2012-01-06T09:28:19  <mcstar> or combinatorial

2012-01-06T09:28:32  <ahow984_> actually :P

2012-01-06T11:39:18  <rwest> mcstar: what is your PE friend key?
2012-01-06T11:39:32  <ahow984_> there are 2 cows, at 0,0 and 5,5 (one at each)
2012-01-06T11:40:12  <ahow984_> you have to find out how many ways they can eat all the grass in the field and end up finishing at the same location
2012-01-06T11:40:36  <ahow984_> but the problem is some areas are barren, so they can't stand at them locations
2012-01-06T11:41:18  <ahow984_> given the number of barren patches (and their locations), how many ways can they reach the same patch having eaten all other bits of grass?
2012-01-06T11:41:34  <rwest> ahow984_: should just be a graph
2012-01-06T11:41:55  <mcstar> huh?
2012-01-06T11:42:03  <mcstar> 5x5 but you have index 5?
2012-01-06T11:42:12  <mcstar> from 0-5 thats 6x6

2012-01-06T11:42:24  <ahow984_> sorry, 0,0 and 4,4
2012-01-06T11:43:00  <rwest> ahow984_: do they both have to move the same amount of times?
2012-01-06T11:43:03  <ahow984_> complete with a dodgy function that posesses some recursive qualities :P
2012-01-06T11:43:06  <ahow984_> rwest: yes
2012-01-06T11:43:21  <ahow984_> and once a patch has been stood on, they can't move there again
2012-01-06T11:43:27  <mcstar> so barren areas are totally excluded
2012-01-06T11:43:31  <ahow984_> yes
2012-01-06T11:43:51  <rwest> ahow984_: there is a recursive solution that is simple
2012-01-06T11:43:58  <ahow984_> haha

2012-01-06T11:44:12  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-06T11:44:15  <rwest> though the search space is small enough
2012-01-06T11:44:18  <ahow984_> I just ignored the < 1s runtime
2012-01-06T11:44:23  <ahow984_> but explain?
2012-01-06T11:44:43  <rwest> basically just an exhaustive search
2012-01-06T11:45:01  <ahow984_> like what I tried to do?
2012-01-06T11:45:02  <rwest> you try every move with each cow and add 1 if they end on the same tile at the end
2012-01-06T11:45:07  <rwest> lemme look at yours
2012-01-06T11:45:21  <ahow984_> codepad link ^^
2012-01-06T11:46:13  <mcstar> can they step back to a visited patch?
2012-01-06T11:46:19  <rwest> mcstar: no
2012-01-06T11:46:23  <ahow984_> no
2012-01-06T11:46:47  <rwest> ahow984_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm
2012-01-06T11:46:58  <ahow984_> I don't see whats wrong with my code :/
2012-01-06T11:47:15  <mcstar> this problem is too hard for me
2012-01-06T11:47:54  <rwest> basically you need to push moves onto a stack and check them for validity, return 0 if not valid else, do next move
2012-01-06T11:47:55  <ahow984_> huh, I don't feel too bad so
2012-01-06T11:48:09  <rwest> if they end up on the same space at the end with no more valid moves, return 1
2012-01-06T11:48:23  <ahow984_> rwest: I don't see the huge difference between that and my code?
2012-01-06T11:48:55  <rwest> ahow984_: It probably is the same, but it's harder to follow iteratively
2012-01-06T11:49:05  <ahow984_> kk
2012-01-06T11:49:27  <ahow984_> :/ it should work, thats what really annoys me :(
2012-01-06T11:49:50  <rwest> you could remove the for loop with the switch
2012-01-06T11:49:55  <rwest> and just leave the if statements
2012-01-06T11:50:10  <rwest> since you are running them all anyway
2012-01-06T11:50:45  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-06T11:50:55  <ahow984_> so I'll remove the for and the switch
2012-01-06T11:51:55  <rwest> you never return answer?
2012-01-06T11:52:05  <rwest> nvm global
2012-01-06T11:52:33  <rwest> you are almost doing recursion heh
2012-01-06T11:52:36  <rwest> I just noticed
2012-01-06T11:52:42  <ahow984_> heh
2012-01-06T11:52:44  <ahow984_> yeah :P
2012-01-06T11:53:07  <ahow984_> it works recursively, but isn't actually recursion :P
2012-01-06T11:53:35  <ahow984_> and taking out that switch and them made runtime about 6 times shorter :P
2012-01-06T11:54:15  <rwest> you should check validity of the move at the begining of the function
2012-01-06T11:54:39  <rwest> and return get_answer(move) + get_answer(othermove) + ...
2012-01-06T11:54:44  <rwest> to make it real recursion
2012-01-06T11:54:48  <rwest> it's easier to read that way
2012-01-06T11:54:55  <ahow984_> hmm
2012-01-06T11:55:00  <ahow984_> kk, I'll try

2012-01-06T12:14:16  <rwest> and unfortunately that makes for 16 calls per recursion

2012-01-06T12:17:21  <antimatroid> nobody wants to harrass my prime code for me? :(
2012-01-06T12:17:34  <ahow984_> antimatroid: I saw it, its not how I do it but it looks faster
2012-01-06T12:17:44  <antimatroid> how do you do it?
2012-01-06T12:17:47  <ahow984_> I just do a simple sieve or erasthotenes
2012-01-06T12:17:54  <antimatroid> that's what i'm doing
2012-01-06T12:17:56  <antimatroid> essentially
2012-01-06T12:18:01  <ahow984_> *however you spell it

2012-01-06T12:19:06  <rwest> antimatroid: I believe that is the fastest way possible
2012-01-06T12:19:09  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@barracuda.imagesourceinc.com> has joined #aichallenge
2012-01-06T12:19:26  <antimatroid> possible or known?
2012-01-06T12:19:33  <rwest> ahow984_: I mean there should be 16 possible moves per turn
2012-01-06T12:19:38  <antimatroid> i'd be interested if there was a proof that that's the most efficient
2012-01-06T12:19:42  <rwest> antimatroid: same thing?
2012-01-06T12:19:44  <rwest> lol
2012-01-06T12:19:48  <antimatroid> nowhere near
2012-01-06T12:20:11  <antimatroid> if you can show something is the most efficient there's no need to look any further :P
2012-01-06T12:20:23  <rwest> ahow984_: because he cow can move 4 ways and there are 2 of them
2012-01-06T12:20:29  <rwest> so 4^2 moves
2012-01-06T12:20:48  <rwest> antimatroid: that is a difficult task
2012-01-06T12:20:52  <mcstar> lol
2012-01-06T12:21:01  <mcstar> i have something that runs instantly
2012-01-06T12:21:03  <antimatroid> it is, but it's the sort of thing you see in statistic
2012-01-06T12:21:04  <antimatroid> s
2012-01-06T12:21:17  <mcstar> ive got to peel the result out from the calculatini though
2012-01-06T12:21:35  <rwest> antimatroid: what problem you doing btw?
2012-01-06T12:21:41  <antimatroid> mcstar: mine's reasonably fast
2012-01-06T12:21:49  <antimatroid> rwest: just starting to look at 49
2012-01-06T12:21:51  <antimatroid> but being lazy
2012-01-06T12:21:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: not talking about primes
2012-01-06T12:22:00  <antimatroid> i did 50 but it was really slow
2012-01-06T12:25:07  <ahow984_> rwest:
2012-01-06T12:25:15  <ahow984_> do you understand what I'm saying?
2012-01-06T12:25:51  <ahow984_> bbiab, dinner
2012-01-06T12:27:53  <mcstar> nice, much better segfault
2012-01-06T12:32:41  <antimatroid> that sucks
2012-01-06T12:32:53  <antimatroid> i get problem 50 out in 0.148s if i don't do it "correctly"
2012-01-06T12:33:05  <antimatroid> it gets the correct answer, but it's not really checking it properly
2012-01-06T12:33:22  <antimatroid> from the forum you can tell most people didn't do it properly

2012-01-06T12:39:06  <antimatroid> thestinger: perfect timing, how did you do 50?
2012-01-06T12:39:23  <thestinger> sec
2012-01-06T12:39:30  <antimatroid> did you check for sums of consecutive primes starting anywhere or just from 2?
2012-01-06T12:39:47  <antimatroid> it takes me less that 200ms to do the later, almost 20s to do the former
2012-01-06T12:39:59  <antimatroid> both give the correct answer, but imo the former is the correct way to do it
2012-01-06T12:40:02  <mcstar> hm
2012-01-06T12:40:23  <thestinger> lol, I used Go for this
2012-01-06T12:40:27  <thestinger> crappy language
2012-01-06T12:40:34  <mcstar> ahow984_: whats the result if there are no "barren" areas?
2012-01-06T12:40:45  <rwest> ahow984_: I do, but you are still missing a lot of possible moves
2012-01-06T12:41:06  <thestinger> antimatroid: I got all primes below 1000000 and then found the highest consecutive ones or whatever
2012-01-06T12:41:14  <rwest> problem 17 is being annoying
2012-01-06T12:41:21  <rwest> oh shit I see it
2012-01-06T12:41:37  <antimatroid> thestinger: but highest how? starting from 2+.... ? or prime + ....?
2012-01-06T12:41:49  <antimatroid> if you just check from 2 + ... you get the right answer
2012-01-06T12:42:10  <thestinger> oh
2012-01-06T12:42:12  <thestinger> well
2012-01-06T12:42:15  <mcstar> rwest: do you have a solution to ahow984_ 's proposal?
2012-01-06T12:42:20  <thestinger> I find the longest consecutive chain of them, anywhere
2012-01-06T12:42:22  <mcstar> i "think" mine is working
2012-01-06T12:42:31  <mcstar> but i  cant check it
2012-01-06T12:42:43  <antimatroid> yeah, that's what i did but slowly
2012-01-06T12:43:00  <thestinger> mine takes 120ms
2012-01-06T12:43:19  <antimatroid> but i think you get the right answer anyway, at least it did when I cut it short when the sum of primes starting at 2 is above 1000000
2012-01-06T12:43:21  <thestinger> I don't really understand my code, lemme figure it out
2012-01-06T12:43:22  <thestinger> lol
2012-01-06T12:43:28  <antimatroid> although it may have still done it somewhat differently i guess
2012-01-06T12:43:39  <antimatroid> i'm going to get some more sleep i think
2012-01-06T12:44:05  <thestinger> ah okay
2012-01-06T12:44:07  <thestinger> I used a slice
2012-01-06T12:44:18  <mcstar> that makes sense
2012-01-06T12:44:22  <thestinger> and I basically just did takeWhile and took a sum
2012-01-06T12:44:26  <thestinger> if I read this correctly
2012-01-06T12:44:41  <thestinger> I precalculated all the primes
2012-01-06T12:45:05  <rwest> mcstar: which proposal?
2012-01-06T12:45:07  <thestinger> anyway, Go sucks
2012-01-06T12:45:44  <antimatroid> Go lost me with requiring { not be on a newline

2012-01-06T12:46:09  <antimatroid> it was enough to turn me off
2012-01-06T12:46:10  <rwest> mcstar: I know how to do it, I just haven't done it myself

2012-01-06T12:46:44  <antimatroid> it's nice when functions get large

2012-01-06T12:46:52  <thestinger> antimatroid: why?
2012-01-06T12:47:01  <antimatroid> seeing where indentation ends
2012-01-06T12:47:11  <rwest> mcstar: you mean the number of paths?
2012-01-06T12:47:16  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-06T12:47:29  <rwest> I dunno, i would have to do the problem, I am guessing it's a large number
2012-01-06T12:47:36  <antimatroid> i just find it easier and nicer with the brackets, creature of habit perhaps :P
2012-01-06T12:47:38  <mcstar> i get ~3000
2012-01-06T12:47:41  <thestinger> antimatroid: well, when you've been coding in a language like haskell/python that let you use indentation for blocks, you get used to it
2012-01-06T12:47:41  <mcstar> i get ~30000
2012-01-06T12:47:55  <thestinger> I've done a lot in languages with {} and with indentation, and indentation is better :P
2012-01-06T12:48:03  <rwest> that's something I would think would be correct
2012-01-06T12:48:27  <rwest> as long as you have the cows moving independent of eachother
2012-01-06T12:48:38  <mcstar> rwest: is it required that the cows' last step is to the same tile?
2012-01-06T12:48:43  <rwest> yes
2012-01-06T12:48:49  <mcstar> they are independent
2012-01-06T12:48:59  <mcstar> but i dont check for the prev. condition

2012-01-06T13:04:03  <mcstar> nice

2012-01-06T13:04:56  <mcstar> thestinger: tuple comprehension?
2012-01-06T13:05:07  <thestinger> well, list comprehensions are generalized in python
2012-01-06T13:05:11  <thestinger> to generator expressions
2012-01-06T13:05:15  <thestinger> they are lazily calculated
2012-01-06T13:05:21  <thestinger> that's just a generator comprehension
2012-01-06T13:05:23  <mcstar> ah, () is a generator
2012-01-06T13:05:26  <mcstar> ok
2012-01-06T13:05:28  <thestinger> well
2012-01-06T13:05:31  <mcstar> i read about it long ago
2012-01-06T13:05:35  <thestinger> don't need the ()
2012-01-06T13:05:51  <thestinger> x*2 for x in range(10) if x % 2
2012-01-06T13:05:56  <thestinger> with [ ] around it, it makes a list
2012-01-06T13:06:02  <thestinger> originally, that was the only way you could do it
2012-01-06T13:06:06  <thestinger> but now it's generalized
2012-01-06T13:06:08  <thestinger> so
2012-01-06T13:06:12  <thestinger> {x for x in range(10)}
2012-01-06T13:06:15  <thestinger> set comprehension
2012-01-06T13:06:43  <thestinger> can do a dictionary comprehension, etc. too
2012-01-06T13:06:49  <mcstar> to these things scale well for large data?
2012-01-06T13:06:54  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-06T13:07:01  <thestinger> a generator expression or function is lazy
2012-01-06T13:07:15  <mcstar> i mean the others
2012-01-06T13:07:16  <thestinger> comprehensions are the non-lazy version
2012-01-06T13:07:19  <thestinger> well, they scale well
2012-01-06T13:07:23  <mcstar> [] and {}
2012-01-06T13:07:30  <thestinger> yeah, much faster than a python for loop
2012-01-06T13:07:42  <thestinger> also you can do a dictionary comprehension, etc.
2012-01-06T13:08:01  <thestinger> for a tuple you have to use the generator version and wrap it in tuple()
2012-01-06T13:08:06  <thestinger> tuple(x for x in range(10))
2012-01-06T13:08:24  <thestinger> anyway you could also do a list, set, dict, etc. like that
2012-01-06T13:08:31  <thestinger> probably no real speed difference in pypy
2012-01-06T13:08:49  <rwest> mcstar: lol I didnt add in the numbers 21-99 because I removed a line on accident
2012-01-06T13:09:02  <thestinger> mcstar: range() is a generator in python3, so it's lazy
2012-01-06T13:09:18  <thestinger> you can just make a generator function with yield, or make a generator expression
2012-01-06T13:09:21  <mcstar> thestinger: i was just missing xrange today! so thats the answer
2012-01-06T13:11:36  <thestinger> mcstar: anyway, the idiom is to usually make your functions that return a sequence of things into generators
2012-01-06T13:11:40  <thestinger> so you get laziness
2012-01-06T13:11:46  <thestinger> the overhead isn't really very much
2012-01-06T13:12:23  <mcstar> it still, isnt like haskell's lazyness
2012-01-06T13:12:26  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-06T13:12:29  <mcstar> but thats probably a good thing
2012-01-06T13:14:40  <thestinger> for 59 I basically made a string comprehension :P
2012-01-06T13:14:43  <thestinger> for part of it
2012-01-06T13:14:53  <thestinger> "".join(chr(char ^ key) for char, key in zip(encoded, cycle(key)))
2012-01-06T13:15:24  <thestinger> itertools and functools have some nice stuff that's in Prelude in haskell
2012-01-06T13:15:40  <thestinger> zip is a built-in though
2012-01-06T13:17:41  <mcstar> would you mind only pasting solution to problems that i sovled?
2012-01-06T13:17:57  <thestinger> well, that's not really a solution :P

2012-01-06T13:30:07  <thestinger> yay, done 32
2012-01-06T13:30:09  <thestinger> on to 33 :)
2012-01-06T13:30:22  <ahow984_> I don't know the result if there are no barren areas
2012-01-06T13:30:25  <thestinger> some of these are easy to just brute force
2012-01-06T13:30:29  <ahow984_> oh, my code will work with that
2012-01-06T13:30:29  <ahow984_> sec
2012-01-06T13:30:56  <mcstar> ahow984_: how do you check for correctness?

2012-01-06T13:31:42  <thestinger> do 79
2012-01-06T13:32:11  <thestinger> you can do it with *nix command-line utilities in a line
2012-01-06T13:32:12  <ahow984_> mcstar: there must be more problems then I though
2012-01-06T13:32:13  <ahow984_> *thought

2012-01-06T13:33:07  <thestinger> well, easier just to do it in python/haskell anyway
2012-01-06T13:33:34  <ahow984_> rwest: oh? yes, I see now
2012-01-06T13:33:50  <mcstar> i doiim heavily
2012-01-06T13:33:52  <thestinger> you could also do 79 on paper in 5 minutes
2012-01-06T13:33:57  <ahow984_> there might be multiple ways one cow can get to the goal instead of just one >_<
2012-01-06T13:34:03  <mcstar> damn
2012-01-06T13:34:36  <mcstar> thats niot what i said
2012-01-06T13:34:37  <mcstar> im doing a brute force one

2012-01-06T13:35:59  <mcstar> the system could handle the strain
2012-01-06T13:36:59  <rwest> lol I did 79 in a text file
2012-01-06T13:37:09  <rwest> took 3 minutes
2012-01-06T13:37:19  <rwest> to just compare the strings
2012-01-06T13:37:23  <rwest> err codes
2012-01-06T13:39:14  <thestinger> oh well, 78 looks pretty easy
2012-01-06T13:39:19  <thestinger> just a bit of recursion
2012-01-06T13:40:15  <rwest> 78 is a math problem lol
2012-01-06T13:40:34  <thestinger> lots can be solved with math
2012-01-06T13:40:35  <rwest> nvm
2012-01-06T13:40:38  <rwest> read it
2012-01-06T13:40:43  <thestinger> I dunno how to solve this with math :P
2012-01-06T13:40:51  <rwest> it's math but you need to compare
2012-01-06T13:41:28  <rwest> thestinger: I know it's solvable via math, I just don't know how haha
2012-01-06T13:43:23  <ahow984_> damn, I was all excited because I thought I solved 78 :P
2012-01-06T13:43:43  <ahow984_> maybe I can do these with the little math I know :P

2012-01-06T14:49:22  <ahow984_> and thestinger yes, wtf?
2012-01-06T14:49:23  <pairofdice> 33 is certainly a bit odd

2012-01-06T14:50:59  <thestinger> I didn't optimize that one

2012-01-06T14:51:03  <ahow984_> that btw :P
2012-01-06T14:51:08  <thestinger> rwest: well, how are you factoring?
2012-01-06T14:52:27  <rwest> thestinger: the worst possible way, but that is not the slow part lol
2012-01-06T14:52:40  <McLeopold> anyone working on one above 74?
2012-01-06T14:53:11  <rwest> thestinger: my problem is determining if the number is the sum of the 2 nums
2012-01-06T14:53:16  <rwest> I am just trying everything
2012-01-06T14:53:41  <rwest> thus 6965^2 iterations per number
2012-01-06T14:53:50  <rwest> I guess I can cut that down easily
2012-01-06T14:54:18  <thestinger> hmm, why?
2012-01-06T14:54:25  <rwest> still leaves a lot of checks for the high numbers
2012-01-06T14:54:30  <thestinger> sum(factors(n)) > n+n
2012-01-06T14:54:34  <thestinger> mine just compares that
2012-01-06T14:54:36  <rwest> because there are 6965 abundant numbers
2012-01-06T14:55:01  <thestinger> well, I did this a long time ago
2012-01-06T14:55:14  <rwest> maybe I am going about this the wrong way?
2012-01-06T14:55:39  <thestinger> well, mine takes 500ms in python
2012-01-06T14:56:17  <rwest> mine will take forever in php

2012-01-06T16:02:46  <thestinger> I know of it, but I haven't tried it
2012-01-06T16:02:51  <mcstar> why i really liked it, is that it has a nice notebook interface
2012-01-06T16:03:11  <mcstar> you can have these notebooks, very comfortable, and have it all in the browser
2012-01-06T16:03:26  <mcstar> anyway, it was the best python interaction i could find

2012-01-06T16:26:55  <aerique> amstan: i've already got access to the main repo :-)
2012-01-06T16:27:31  <aerique> amstan: and check the example-game.sh script on how to run a game
2012-01-06T16:27:41  <amstan> aerique: mcleopold suggested that we delay work on games, so we don't have the situation we had last time(with people getting awesome in beta)
2012-01-06T16:28:04  <aerique> amstan: yeah, he has a point
2012-01-06T16:28:48  <aerique> amstan: but how to evaluate the game ideas then?  just discuss them and decide on one?
2012-01-06T16:30:03  <amstan> what he means is that we should only concentrate on the game after we have the rest of the framework ready
2012-01-06T16:30:38  <ahow984_> http://codepad.org/Tb0GLZCR
2012-01-06T16:30:48  <ahow984_> Problem 18 (the smaller triangle one)
2012-01-06T16:31:06  <thestinger> ahow984_: try the big one now :)
2012-01-06T16:31:20  <ahow984_> I will once this one works ;)
2012-01-06T16:32:17  <aerique> amstan: oh, i thought the framework was ready :)  what needs to be done still?
2012-01-06T16:32:23  <amstan> everything
2012-01-06T16:32:28  <amstan> we're replacing php with django
2012-01-06T16:32:44  <ahow984_> mcstar: any idea whats making it not give the right answer?
2012-01-06T16:33:06  <mcstar> ahow984_: what does not?
2012-01-06T16:33:30  <ahow984_> my code in the codepad link
2012-01-06T16:34:01  <amstan> oh! i get how to solve that!
2012-01-06T16:34:04  <amstan> you start from the bottom
2012-01-06T16:34:18  <ahow984_> yeah, but I'm starting from the top because it's easier :P
2012-01-06T16:34:31  <pairofdice> (it's not)
2012-01-06T16:34:44  <ahow984_> oh?
2012-01-06T16:35:00  <thestinger> amstan: yeah, that's how I did it
2012-01-06T16:35:01  <amstan> and then always expand the one that has a bigger sum
2012-01-06T16:35:07  <amstan> or something
2012-01-06T16:35:14  <pairofdice> And he scores
2012-01-06T16:35:19  <thestinger> yup, I did that
2012-01-06T16:35:29  <amstan> well.. i was following ahow984_'s code
2012-01-06T16:35:35  <ahow984_> :P
2012-01-06T16:35:38  <amstan> but i realized that a ton of calculations are repeated
2012-01-06T16:35:44  <ahow984_> you mean, the one that doesn't work? :P
2012-01-06T16:35:48  <amstan> i was thinking of ways of caching it
2012-01-06T16:35:58  <thestinger> amstan: http://sprunge.us/bEjN that was mine (for the bigger triangle)
2012-01-06T16:36:00  <amstan> starting from the bottom does that
2012-01-06T16:37:00  <amstan> yeah, because from the bottom you only go through all elements once
2012-01-06T16:37:08  <thestinger> yeah, you choose the bigger sum and just work up to the top
2012-01-06T16:37:09  <amstan> from the top you go a lot of times
2012-01-06T16:37:28  <pairofdice> I've been 'working' on 24 for far too long now
2012-01-06T16:38:15  <pairofdice> Well, from the the top you can do almost the same thing actually
2012-01-06T16:38:42  <pairofdice> Sum the upper number to both the lower ones and then at the lowest take the max
2012-01-06T16:38:44  <ahow984_> so any ideas whats wrong with my code?
2012-01-06T16:39:15  <pairofdice> None whatsoever
2012-01-06T16:40:22  <amstan> pairofdice: did you try it for the 3 element triangle case?
2012-01-06T16:41:22  <ahow984_> anyone? anyone?
2012-01-06T16:41:23  <pairofdice> well it's not quite so straightforward
2012-01-06T16:41:54  <amstan> ahow984_: did you try it for the 3 element triangle case
2012-01-06T16:42:01  <amstan> pairofdice: sorry, i meant to send it to him ^
2012-01-06T16:42:08  <ahow984_> oh, no
2012-01-06T16:42:17  <pairofdice> ^^
2012-01-06T16:42:18  <amstan> it should help..
2012-01-06T16:42:18  <ahow984_> I thought that was @pairofdice :P
2012-01-06T16:42:51  <ahow984_> lol fail
2012-01-06T16:42:53  <ahow984_> ok

2012-01-06T16:52:42  <thestinger> well

2012-01-06T16:54:25  <ahow984_> grrr combinatorics
2012-01-06T16:54:42  <amstan> well.. the idea with most of those is that your algorithm gives you the speed boost, not the language
2012-01-06T16:54:44  <amstan> same in aichallenge
2012-01-06T16:55:14  <thestinger> well, I never really have trouble with speed
2012-01-06T16:55:26  <thestinger> once I get a proper algorithm
2012-01-06T16:55:45  <pairofdice> You struck the point squarely there

2012-01-06T19:10:06  <mcstar> i thought .[100] is needed
2012-01-06T19:10:13  <thestinger> I tested with sqrt(2) at first and it tricked me
2012-01-06T19:10:27  <thestinger> because I only did 100 digits of precision, and I need more to get the right answer
2012-01-06T19:10:49  <thestinger> so the sum of the digits after the . was correct, but the digits at the end were wrong :P
2012-01-06T19:10:57  <thestinger> digit at the end*
2012-01-06T19:11:01  <mcstar> i know my digits are good

2012-01-06T19:54:31  <thestinger> which is that?
2012-01-06T19:54:35  <mcstar> 45
2012-01-06T19:54:36  <thestinger> oh
2012-01-06T19:54:38  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-06T19:54:53  <mcstar> pretty ugly
2012-01-06T19:55:02  <thestinger> hexagonal numbers are triangle numbers
2012-01-06T19:56:26  <thestinger> anyway, I want to make my solution nicer
2012-01-06T19:57:17  <thestinger> I guess I could just make is_pentagonal
2012-01-06T19:57:27  <mcstar> i didnt know how to represent the state of the computation except with arguments :(

2012-01-06T19:58:56  <thestinger> oh, you can just solve the equation
2012-01-06T20:00:53  <mcstar> again, im doing them to excercise(mainly haskell, except when i dunno how)
2012-01-06T20:01:09  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-06T20:01:15  <thestinger> I like doing them a few different ways
2012-01-06T20:01:20  <thestinger> and then figuring out how to optimize

2012-01-06T20:06:19  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/TTVW there's my nice solution to 45 after optimizing a bit
2012-01-06T20:06:53  <thestinger> well
2012-01-06T20:07:01  <thestinger> left in an evil global :P

2012-01-06T21:01:46  <antimatroid> thestinger: take a look at problem 344
2012-01-06T21:01:49  <antimatroid> it looks cool
2012-01-06T21:01:56  <antimatroid> dealing with the large numbers doesn't seem so fun
2012-01-06T21:02:43  <antimatroid> i imagine the game solution isn't far off being like nim
2012-01-06T21:05:40  <rwest_> you guys are still on?
2012-01-06T21:05:41  <rwest_> heh
