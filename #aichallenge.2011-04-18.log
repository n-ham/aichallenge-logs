2011-04-18T01:58:49  <bhasker> hey i ran into some weird state
2011-04-18T01:58:54  <bhasker> .a*a.
2011-04-18T01:59:00  <bhasker> basically when my bot got into this state
2011-04-18T01:59:03  <bhasker> no new ant is spawning
2011-04-18T01:59:56  <antimatroid> hmm, i'll take a look later

2011-04-18T02:17:25  <antimatroid> Ice_Harley: I have no way of handling that case fast enough
2011-04-18T02:17:30  <antimatroid> and smart enough
2011-04-18T02:17:57  <antimatroid> it's a bit of a pitty people wont have enough time to do the really interesting ideas
2011-04-18T02:18:05  <antimatroid> but people insist on having larger maps
2011-04-18T02:18:40  <antimatroid> which will make language choice even more important
2011-04-18T02:18:54  <antimatroid> it's going to be a contest of who can do the best stuff in the time limit
2011-04-18T02:19:05  <antimatroid> and macro strategy of course :P
2011-04-18T02:21:02  <Ice_Harley> antimatroid: so you just go to closest food everytime?
2011-04-18T02:21:17  <antimatroid> reusing already moved ants yes
2011-04-18T02:21:41  <antimatroid> i considered moving to the food square closest to me that minimises the distance to an enemy each iteration, but i don't think that'd work as well
2011-04-18T02:21:43  <Ice_Harley> I didn't find soluthion for this either
2011-04-18T02:23:55  <antimatroid> ideally you want to use a game tree for that too
2011-04-18T02:23:59  <antimatroid> but i'm saving that for battles
2011-04-18T02:27:59  <Ice_Harley> I thought about trees. What kind of tree you can do? Each node is one move? Or each node is ant from food spawn?
2011-04-18T02:29:34  <Ice_Harley> First variant will have huge number of nodes. Second - how to handle that when one ant takes food others shold go somewhere?
2011-04-18T02:37:19  <antimatroid> when i collect food now i already update the information at the food square as to when that will be available for collecting more food
2011-04-18T02:37:33  <antimatroid> so yeah, i would be moving it to "next to" the food square in the tree
2011-04-18T02:45:39  <Ice_Harley> but you can't build new position because you don't know where will be other ants on this step

2011-04-18T03:06:06  <antimatroid> Ice_Harley: what do you mean?
2011-04-18T03:08:44  <Ice_Harley> Each node in tree is map position, isn't it?
2011-04-18T03:09:41  *** jaycobcoleman <jaycobcoleman!d84332d7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.216.67.50.215> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-04-18T03:10:23  <antimatroid> each node in the tree contains a game state
2011-04-18T03:10:30  <antimatroid> each edge is a strategy
2011-04-18T03:11:54  <Ice_Harley> yes-yes. So when you create new node where strategy is ant A1 goes to food F1 you need new game state. In this game state A1 is near F1, and instead F1 you have new ant A2. But where are ants A3, A4 and A5?
2011-04-18T03:12:27  <antimatroid> where they were before unmoves
2011-04-18T03:12:48  <antimatroid> then for each of those children you move A3, A4 and A5
2011-04-18T03:13:07  <antimatroid> or A1 and A2 again for collecting food
2011-04-18T03:14:12  <Ice_Harley> You don't take into account that A1 and A3 are moving simultaneously?
2011-04-18T03:14:23  <antimatroid> for blocking paths?
2011-04-18T03:14:24  <janzert> ARGH, a combination of github's SSL certificate and redirect setup trigger a bug in wget such that you can't securely download tarballs using wget, this is making my life difficult in trying to refactor the worker setup scripts in preparation for adding jailuser chroot setup to them so I can then add that to the sandbox.
2011-04-18T03:14:40  <janzert> I think it's time to go to bed and work on it tomorrow
2011-04-18T03:14:46  *** jaycobcoleman <jaycobcoleman!d84332d7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.216.67.50.215> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-18T03:15:08  <antimatroid> one option is to have a map set<pair<int, Location> > to mark when a square will be "taken"
2011-04-18T03:15:16  <antimatroid> and use that information when path finding
2011-04-18T03:15:26  <antimatroid> /s/map/set
2011-04-18T03:15:32  <antimatroid> or just remove map :P
2011-04-18T03:16:20  <antimatroid> int represents the turn it will be occupied on
2011-04-18T03:16:55  <antimatroid> but i suspect to be quite limited on time
2011-04-18T03:17:01  <antimatroid> so i'm not really sure what will work best yet
2011-04-18T03:17:13  <antimatroid> expect* ergh :P
2011-04-18T03:17:43  <Ice_Harley> for blocking pathes I think it's much easier to check moves before submitting to server and if two ants go to one square just recalculate path for one of them, marking that square as water
2011-04-18T03:18:48  <jaycobcoleman> information on the location of water squares isn't reset each turn by default, so watch out doing that.
2011-04-18T03:20:36  <antimatroid> you can't mark a square as water, you need to retain water information across turns
2011-04-18T03:20:36  <antimatroid> there are times where you might have ants cross each others paths that you need to account for
2011-04-18T03:20:36  <antimatroid> but you don't want to say the ant can't walk through the path of another ant at all
2011-04-18T03:20:36  <antimatroid> that would really block off what you can actually do
2011-04-18T03:20:36  <antimatroid> for my squares, i have int ant, and vector<int> newAnts, deadAnts
2011-04-18T03:20:43  <Ice_Harley> jaycobcoleman: it's in temporary game state. I will not change real one
2011-04-18T03:21:08  <antimatroid> when i move an ant, i place it onto newAnts (same as when i'm inputting state information), then when i increment states or resolve information etc. I move the ants back from newAnts to ant
2011-04-18T03:22:02  <antimatroid> that way in your game tree for example (or heuristics if you don't mind the odd "crash of ants") you can move an ant onto a square containing another ant before it moves

2011-04-18T03:23:18  <sigh> finished my first day of work at Google :D
2011-04-18T03:23:25  <antimatroid> another thing you will want to do at some point is work out how to retain information about food squares that existed when they went out of visibility of you
2011-04-18T03:23:41  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: I'm so jealous of you
2011-04-18T03:23:48  <antimatroid> the annoying thing is you are only implicitly told if it's no longer there when you get back in view by not being told it's there

2011-04-18T03:38:42  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: if you are serious about cs and not just programming, i can't recommend doing a dual maths major enough :)
2011-04-18T03:39:14  <antimatroid> and i'm not very knowledgeable about cs, but i sort of know about the different things :P
2011-04-18T03:39:55  <sigh> in cs if you know the basic concepts it's much easier to pick up anything else
2011-04-18T03:40:15  <antimatroid> i think that's the case for everything :P
2011-04-18T03:40:33  <jaycobcoleman> Well then, to problem number one it is
2011-04-18T03:40:51  <sigh> antimatroid: yes and no
2011-04-18T03:40:51  <antimatroid> what language do you use?
2011-04-18T03:41:12  <sigh> antimatroid: for example in math, ever new subject redefines what is "basic"

2011-04-18T03:41:53  <antimatroid> maybe, it's still good to know the basics
2011-04-18T03:42:02  <antimatroid> i love that video
2011-04-18T03:42:05  <sigh> what do you count as the basics for maths?
2011-04-18T03:42:27  <antimatroid> depends on what areas of maths, is there another word that encompasses more?
2011-04-18T03:42:32  <antimatroid> everything :P
2011-04-18T03:42:36  <antimatroid> but you know what i mean
2011-04-18T03:42:53  <sigh> that was my point, the basics covers too much :P
2011-04-18T03:42:58  <antimatroid> for pure maths say, knowing about sets, relations, etc. is vital
2011-04-18T03:43:09  <antimatroid> then you just keep building
2011-04-18T03:44:24  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: Where you asking what language I use?
2011-04-18T03:44:56  <sigh> he was
2011-04-18T03:45:12  <jaycobcoleman> mostly python
2011-04-18T03:45:16  <jaycobcoleman> and C++
2011-04-18T03:45:21  <jaycobcoleman> I know you like that one
2011-04-18T03:47:42  <antimatroid> anything but java and i wont hate on you too much :P
2011-04-18T03:48:15  <antimatroid> imo c++ is better for maths, because if you define matrices you can overload operators on them
2011-04-18T03:48:17  <jaycobcoleman> I don't understand java worth crap
2011-04-18T03:49:07  <antimatroid> Matrix A = 2*B*(C^4) is a lot better than
2011-04-18T03:49:07  <antimatroid> Matrix A = smult(2, mult(B, pow(C, 4)))
2011-04-18T03:49:20  <sigh> antimatroid: you can do that in python too
2011-04-18T03:49:24  <antimatroid> ah, nevermind then
2011-04-18T03:49:46  <sigh> infact, numpy already does that for you :P
2011-04-18T03:50:01  <antimatroid> does it do tensors?
2011-04-18T03:50:06  <jaycobcoleman> I like numpy :)
2011-04-18T03:50:45  <sigh> antimatroid: dunno, haven't worked with tensors
2011-04-18T03:50:55  <antimatroid> i am tempted to do a second normal form game class with utilities represented as map<NStrategy, utilityType>
2011-04-18T03:51:04  <antimatroid> it's slower, but way easier
2011-04-18T03:51:38  <jaycobcoleman> I'm using numpy to keep track of the soonest that an enemy ant can be on each square given the information I have
2011-04-18T03:52:02  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: how are you doing that?
2011-04-18T03:53:46  <jaycobcoleman> everytime I get vision information from my ants I'll assign the value of the vision radius to the square I'm on and then a value one less for each square away from that point, then at the beginning of each turn I'll subtract one from the entire array
2011-04-18T03:54:36  <antimatroid> a good way would be as follows: create a "time accessible map" set at -1, add all enemy locations to a queue noting the current distance for each location (currently 0) and set those locations as 0 in the accessible map, then while the queue isn't empty, for any adjacent square with accessible at -1, update that to the current squares value + 1, and add that information to the end of the queue
2011-04-18T03:55:11  <antimatroid> then your accessible map will tell you the shortest turns in which an enemy can reach any square on the map
2011-04-18T03:55:34  <antimatroid> you can do that from food squares to get closest ant to food, from all ants to partition the map into who can reach what first, etc. etc.
2011-04-18T03:56:05  <jaycobcoleman> Yes I'm planning on doing something similar
2011-04-18T03:56:12  <jaycobcoleman> I haven't worked out all the logistics
2011-04-18T03:57:51  <jaycobcoleman> But I plan to come up with several possible moves for each of my ants and evaluating the likelyhood of their success and then any conflict between two ants regarding movement onto a particular aquare will be resolved by the likelyhood of success
2011-04-18T03:57:58  <jaycobcoleman> *square
2011-04-18T03:58:21  <antimatroid> yep, i'm planning to do that just for ants that may land in a battle
2011-04-18T03:58:24  <antimatroid> and use a game tree for it
2011-04-18T03:58:40  <antimatroid> i expect time to be tight
2011-04-18T03:59:01  <jaycobcoleman> I know an unfortunately small amount about game theory
2011-04-18T03:59:59  <antimatroid> the basics are quite simple
2011-04-18T04:00:07  <antimatroid> there's a bit of jargon one needs to get used to though
2011-04-18T04:00:11  <jaycobcoleman> also, I feel like time shouldn't be a concern in this contest, to a reasonable extent anyway.
2011-04-18T04:00:20  <antimatroid> it will be
2011-04-18T04:00:27  <antimatroid> and unfortunately it'll be necessary
2011-04-18T04:00:41  <antimatroid> with a few thousand bots, we need quite a few games for decent rankings, and the contest can't run forever
2011-04-18T04:01:00  <jaycobcoleman> WE NEED MORE SERVERS!!!
2011-04-18T04:01:14  <antimatroid> that requires moar money
2011-04-18T04:01:49  <jaycobcoleman> psh, It's sponsored by google
2011-04-18T04:02:06  <jaycobcoleman> they've got loads of money
2011-04-18T04:05:00  <antimatroid> they have given a bit of money previously, and hopefully some this time
2011-04-18T04:05:15  <antimatroid> but the names mostly there because it looks good for both parties
2011-04-18T04:05:34  <jaycobcoleman> Yeah I kinda figured that out by this point
2011-04-18T04:06:04  <antimatroid> it would be silly to remove it unless google actually wanted us to / stopped giving permission
2011-04-18T04:07:53  <antimatroid> the contest is still quite new, but it's grown well, there was ~800 bots for tron, then ~4700 for planet wars
2011-04-18T04:08:08  <antimatroid> the contests before that were just for uwaterloo students
2011-04-18T04:08:21  <jaycobcoleman> rock, paper, scissors?
2011-04-18T04:08:21  <antimatroid> amstan won the repeated rock paper scissors one
2011-04-18T04:08:31  <antimatroid> repeated
2011-04-18T04:08:34  <jaycobcoleman> have you been here the while time?
2011-04-18T04:08:38  <antimatroid> the bots would play a bunch of games against each other
2011-04-18T04:08:44  <jaycobcoleman> *whole
2011-04-18T04:08:46  <antimatroid> i came in for tron
2011-04-18T04:08:56  <antimatroid> waterloo is in canada, i'm in tasmania, australia :p

2011-04-18T06:13:34  <antimatroid> if the actual functionality is solid i'd say put it up
2011-04-18T06:18:19  <antimatroid> sigh: oh yeah
2011-04-18T06:18:30  <antimatroid> bhasker found a possible bug with ant spawning
2011-04-18T06:18:40  <sigh> what was that?
2011-04-18T06:18:41  <antimatroid> something about ...a*a... not spawning an ant
2011-04-18T06:18:56  <antimatroid> i haven't got around to testing that myself yet
2011-04-18T06:19:28  <sigh> if you can make a repeatable test case, I'll have a look at it
2011-04-18T06:19:46  <antimatroid> i'll have a look in a bit

2011-04-18T07:01:32  <smiley1983> antimatroid: no, but unless someone's in a hurry to get their hands on the code, I'll probably finish it first. I've got the git repository cloned, but I haven't done the research into how to make a pull request yet.
2011-04-18T07:01:50  <antimatroid> yep, there's definitely no rush
2011-04-18T07:02:01  <antimatroid> ps bring it on for first in aus again :P
2011-04-18T07:02:23  <smiley1983> The basic functionality is (I believe) solid, though.
2011-04-18T07:02:43  <smiley1983> Congratulations on being first last time, and by such a large margin. :)
2011-04-18T07:02:43  <antimatroid> i take it you're planning to participate?
2011-04-18T07:02:49  <smiley1983> Yes.
2011-04-18T07:02:53  <antimatroid> you were worrying me towards the end
2011-04-18T07:02:58  <antimatroid> it wasn't clear to me who was best on tcp
2011-04-18T07:03:02  <antimatroid> (i didn't use antimatroid on tcp)
2011-04-18T07:03:23  <antimatroid> but thanks :)
2011-04-18T07:03:33  <smiley1983> Ha. I found it difficult to judge much from the TCP games because the pool of regular opponents was so small
2011-04-18T07:03:49  <antimatroid> still better than testing on the main site
2011-04-18T07:03:57  <antimatroid> i didn't even bother with a bot on there for the last month
2011-04-18T07:03:59  <smiley1983> Oh yes, it was a great blessing
2011-04-18T07:04:20  <smiley1983> That'll be why I didn't notice you among the top ranks until the very end. :)
2011-04-18T07:04:37  <antimatroid> yep, i'm tempted to do the same again
2011-04-18T07:04:42  <antimatroid> it's nice jumping in at the end
2011-04-18T07:05:15  <smiley1983> Can anyone tell me, for the starter pack: should the distance function return the number of steps an ant has to take, or the LOS distance?
2011-04-18T07:05:18  <antimatroid> the plan is to make tcp more official this time, so hopefully we can get more people testing on there
2011-04-18T07:05:28  <antimatroid> LOS?
2011-04-18T07:05:30  <smiley1983> That would be great.
2011-04-18T07:05:33  <smiley1983> Line of Sight
2011-04-18T07:05:36  <antimatroid> distance is the euclidean distance with edges wrapped
2011-04-18T07:05:41  <antimatroid> check the specs page
2011-04-18T07:06:11  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-04-18T07:06:47  <antimatroid> all distances are using that metric
2011-04-18T07:07:13  <antimatroid> which is unfortunately tricky to work with when you do vision calculations, be really careful there
2011-04-18T07:07:39  <smiley1983> ight. I think the python starter bot might be returning number of steps
2011-04-18T07:07:47  <antimatroid> if you do a simple bfs from all ants simultaneously it doesn't always work properly, you miss some
2011-04-18T07:07:54  <antimatroid> have you looked at my c++ bot?
2011-04-18T07:08:02  <antimatroid> that's pretty solid, and reasonably well laid out
2011-04-18T07:08:42  <smiley1983> I haven't - is it the c++ starter bot or available elsewhere?
2011-04-18T07:09:27  <antimatroid> the c++ starter bot
2011-04-18T07:09:27  <smiley1983> also - bfs?
2011-04-18T07:09:33  <antimatroid> breadth first search
2011-04-18T07:09:45  <antimatroid> basically, add all ants locations to a queue, then keep "painting outwards"
2011-04-18T07:10:29  <antimatroid> it's nice for doing stuff like partitioning the squares into which player can reach them first, or finding which ant is closest to a food square etc.
2011-04-18T07:11:54  <smiley1983> Yes. I'm looking at the c++ code now - I had used the Python one for reference because Python is readable, but I've noticed some incompletenesses. I'll use yours for reference from now, thankyou for pointing me to it
2011-04-18T07:14:32  <bhasker> antimatroid did you test my case?
2011-04-18T07:14:57  <antimatroid> bhasker: not yet sorry, got a few other things to do
2011-04-18T07:15:09  <bhasker> kk
2011-04-18T07:16:34  <bhasker> i implemented a basic BFS search to find closest ant
2011-04-18T07:16:38  <bhasker> and extract the path
2011-04-18T07:16:47  <bhasker> to issue orders
2011-04-18T07:16:49  <bhasker> but...
2011-04-18T07:17:03  <bhasker> that bug is stopping my bot from going very far:p
2011-04-18T07:18:39  <antimatroid> strange, i ran games which flooded the map and never noticed anything like that
2011-04-18T07:20:12  <bhasker> i can send you a text copy of the map state if you want
2011-04-18T07:20:16  <bhasker> or a replay
2011-04-18T07:22:32  <antimatroid> do it to sigh
2011-04-18T07:22:38  <antimatroid> but he's not here
2011-04-18T07:22:49  <bhasker> was just reading the logs he is close to where i am
2011-04-18T07:22:52  <bhasker> now that he works at google
2011-04-18T07:23:03  <antimatroid> except he's in sydney :P
2011-04-18T07:23:07  <bhasker> oooh
2011-04-18T07:23:08  <bhasker> doh
2011-04-18T07:23:18  <bhasker> i thought he joined the US office

2011-04-18T07:30:27  <antimatroid> meh, tassie is better :P
2011-04-18T07:31:24  <smiley1983> Yes, I would consider living there if I wasn't set up here
2011-04-18T07:31:47  <antimatroid> i'll probably have to move at the end of this year
2011-04-18T07:31:53  <antimatroid> but i always see myself ending up back here
2011-04-18T07:32:23  <smiley1983> Do you like bushwalking?
2011-04-18T07:32:39  <antimatroid> yeah and camping
2011-04-18T07:32:46  <antimatroid> particularly camping and drinking
2011-04-18T07:33:05  <smiley1983> Definitely a great place yo live then
2011-04-18T07:33:40  <antimatroid> my only complaint is nothing in the way of snowboarding/skiing
2011-04-18T07:33:53  <antimatroid> i've always wanted to, but only ever snowboared for one day
2011-04-18T07:34:52  <smiley1983> Ah. I've been assured it's fun, but it just doesn't appeal to me for some reason.
2011-04-18T07:35:34  <antimatroid> i used to skate a fair bit, so it's always seemed like it'd be even better

2011-04-18T07:37:47  <smiley1983> Yes, it makes a great deal of sense in snowy places :)
2011-04-18T07:38:38  <smiley1983> Do you have any idea of the expected duration of this contest?
2011-04-18T07:38:54  <antimatroid> the number i proposed was 2 months
2011-04-18T07:39:03  <antimatroid> because tron was too short and planet wars too long
2011-04-18T07:39:14  <antimatroid> but there's going to be a beta period for like 2 weeks as well, for ironing stuff out
2011-04-18T07:39:36  <antimatroid> although i'm tempted to change my opinion back to 3 months
2011-04-18T07:39:44  <antimatroid> so people who come in have plenty of time
2011-04-18T07:41:21  <smiley1983> Right. I was thinking it might be good to update the front page so casual visitors know something is happening without checking the forums
2011-04-18T07:42:04  <smiley1983> I checked in sometime in March but didn't look at the forums, and thought nothing was happening yet.
2011-04-18T07:42:16  <antimatroid> hmmm maybe
2011-04-18T07:42:21  <smiley1983> I only checked the forums a few days ago and found that the next game had been determined
2011-04-18T07:42:22  <antimatroid> i'll mention that to amstan
2011-04-18T07:42:35  <antimatroid> yeah, we've been working for ages
2011-04-18T07:42:50  <antimatroid> have you taken a look at the symmetric maps?
2011-04-18T07:43:00  <antimatroid> you can turn symmetric food spawning on too
2011-04-18T07:43:32  <smiley1983> Yes, the test map I've been using is symmetric
2011-04-18T07:43:43  <smiley1983> I haven't fiddled with any options, though
2011-04-18T07:44:32  <antimatroid> --food symmetric
2011-04-18T07:44:41  <antimatroid> add that to your play_one_game script to do symmetric food
2011-04-18T07:44:52  <antimatroid> feel free to make another map generator, we want lots of variety
2011-04-18T07:45:28  <smiley1983> Right. I'll be looking at other things to develop once I'm happy (enough) with my starter pack. :)
2011-04-18T07:47:15  <antimatroid> are you watching games with the viewer or visualiser?
2011-04-18T07:47:21  <antimatroid> the visualiser is far superior
2011-04-18T07:47:48  <smiley1983> Visualiser - I hadn't noticed the viewer
2011-04-18T07:48:03  <antimatroid> cool, ignore what i said
2011-04-18T07:48:56  <smiley1983> So far there isn't anything to watch, though, except to confirm that it's making the correct starter bot moves.
2011-04-18T07:49:25  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-04-18T07:49:34  <antimatroid> i've played around with food collection, which is fun to watch
2011-04-18T07:49:54  <bhasker> antimatroid another bug in the c++ starter bot
2011-04-18T07:50:00  <bhasker> it doesn't clear out old food in the grid
2011-04-18T07:50:00  <antimatroid> :(
2011-04-18T07:50:07  <antimatroid> ah my bad
2011-04-18T07:50:14  <bhasker> so if the food is now an ant
2011-04-18T07:50:20  <bhasker> it still shows up as a food etc
2011-04-18T07:50:32  <bhasker> so probably in the loop which reads in the state
2011-04-18T07:50:36  <bhasker> you need to validate all the food
2011-04-18T07:50:37  <antimatroid> yes it does
2011-04-18T07:50:45  <antimatroid> well, it should :\
2011-04-18T07:50:55  <antimatroid> clear() in square.h has isFood = 0
2011-04-18T07:51:07  <bhasker> it won't right since food information is sent only once when its seen first time?
2011-04-18T07:51:11  <bhasker> and you have this in your loop
2011-04-18T07:51:22  <bhasker>     for(int row=0; row<rows; row++)
2011-04-18T07:51:23  <bhasker>         for(int col=0; col<cols; col++)
2011-04-18T07:51:23  <bhasker>             if(!grid[row][col].isFood)
2011-04-18T07:51:23  <bhasker>                 grid[row][col].reset();
2011-04-18T07:51:29  <bhasker> so it doesn't reset Food Squares
2011-04-18T07:51:37  <antimatroid> oh, that should be isWater
2011-04-18T07:51:38  <antimatroid> cheers
2011-04-18T07:51:53  <bhasker> will food information be sent every turn?
2011-04-18T07:51:59  <bhasker> all visible food?
2011-04-18T07:52:02  <antimatroid> if it's visible
2011-04-18T07:52:04  <bhasker> ah
2011-04-18T07:52:28  <antimatroid> but if you go out of range of food while it's there, you're only implicitly told it's not there anymore when you come back in range by not being told it's there
2011-04-18T07:52:31  <bhasker> water squares arent sent right
2011-04-18T07:52:38  <antimatroid> i really don't like that, but i didn't win that battle
2011-04-18T07:52:49  <antimatroid> water square information is sent once per bot
2011-04-18T07:52:56  <bhasker> doh fixing that makes my bot behave better
2011-04-18T07:52:57  <bhasker> lol
2011-04-18T07:53:02  <bhasker> that was throwing my bot off
2011-04-18T07:53:06  <bhasker> my ants will step on each other
2011-04-18T07:53:11  <bhasker> and die
2011-04-18T07:53:41  <smiley1983> That reminds me - is it okay for a starter pack to track the turn on which each tile was last seen (for the Visible function) or should it clear this info between turns? It's obviously useful to keep it, but not specified in the starter pack guide.

2011-04-18T07:56:30  <antimatroid> there we go :)
2011-04-18T07:56:56  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i think i am?
2011-04-18T07:57:07  <smiley1983> :) Right.
2011-04-18T07:57:15  <bhasker> hah BFS doesn't scale so well once the search space increases:-\
2011-04-18T07:57:22  <bhasker> Found food: 105,62
2011-04-18T07:57:22  <bhasker> Issuing order : 102,43,E
2011-04-18T07:57:22  <bhasker> time taken: 806.759ms
2011-04-18T07:57:24  <bhasker> :-\
2011-04-18T07:57:42  <antimatroid> bhasker: i can do my food collection in under 200ms most of the time
2011-04-18T07:57:59  <bhasker> well each ant is finding in under 10-15 ms
2011-04-18T07:58:12  <antimatroid> i am searching from all food squares simultaneously on each iteration
2011-04-18T07:58:22  <bhasker> ah i am doing reverse
2011-04-18T07:58:27  <bhasker> i thought of that
2011-04-18T07:58:27  <antimatroid> moving the ant that can reach one first, including an ant that's already been moved
2011-04-18T07:58:48  <bhasker> but i am doing a search around each ant
2011-04-18T07:58:53  <bhasker> to closest food
2011-04-18T07:58:56  <bhasker> then guiding the ant
2011-04-18T07:59:02  <antimatroid> expensive :P
2011-04-18T07:59:08  <bhasker> yes
2011-04-18T07:59:17  <antimatroid> i can run mine on 100x100 maps with like 90% starting food
2011-04-18T07:59:36  <bhasker> thats why i will probably replace BFS with an a* to guide the search
2011-04-18T07:59:38  <woudshoo> bashker: Do you stop searching as soon as all food is asigned an ant?
2011-04-18T07:59:51  <bhasker> i stop scanning the moment it finds an available free food
2011-04-18T07:59:59  <antimatroid> a* doesn't help if you don't have a target when you start searching
2011-04-18T08:00:16  <antimatroid> are you searching from all ants at the same time? or each ant individually?
2011-04-18T08:00:19  <bhasker> that is easy
2011-04-18T08:00:24  <bhasker> each ant right now
2011-04-18T08:00:40  <bhasker> getting target is easy
2011-04-18T08:00:49  <bhasker> just find in a circle around the ant food that is not tracked
2011-04-18T08:00:51  <bhasker> by another ant
2011-04-18T08:00:55  <bhasker> then path to that
2011-04-18T08:00:58  <bhasker> using a*
2011-04-18T08:01:09  <antimatroid> i can't imagine that being better
2011-04-18T08:01:27  <bhasker> a* reduces the node exploration by a lot
2011-04-18T08:01:44  <bhasker> though the problem is this map wraps around
2011-04-18T08:01:50  <bhasker> so guiding the search is a little problem
2011-04-18T08:02:00  <antimatroid> it doesn't complicate it much
2011-04-18T08:02:10  <antimatroid> no more than to calculate distances
2011-04-18T08:03:47  <bhasker> http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/MapRepresentations.html#S15
2011-04-18T08:04:01  <bhasker> thats my reference page for all pathfinding related stuff
2011-04-18T08:04:20  <antimatroid> that's silly
2011-04-18T08:04:27  <antimatroid> you use the same a* algorithm
2011-04-18T08:04:37  <antimatroid> with the same rule, just using the new distance metric
2011-04-18T08:08:18  <antimatroid> algorithm/heuristic
2011-04-18T08:17:25  <bhasker> k clearly a bug in my code
2011-04-18T08:17:39  <bhasker> Ant at: 104,43
2011-04-18T08:17:39  <bhasker> Found food: 86,48

2011-04-18T08:17:50  <antimatroid> lol
2011-04-18T08:17:53  <bhasker> in a 108x84 map
2011-04-18T08:18:02  <bhasker> no wonder it took 800ms

2011-04-18T08:26:59  <antimatroid> what language do you want?
2011-04-18T08:27:32  <ginDeVine> Just curious mostly.
2011-04-18T08:28:07  <ginDeVine> I was looking for a JavaScript one, but as I didn't find any, I made my own a few days ago..
2011-04-18T08:28:08  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots
2011-04-18T08:28:43  <ginDeVine> Thanks :D
2011-04-18T08:31:34  <smiley1983> bhasker: I was getting worried (for my own prospects) when you were talking about 800ms to find food, I'm glad to hear it was (probably) a bug.
2011-04-18T08:32:04  <antimatroid> smiley1983: it takes me more than 200ms with lots of food
2011-04-18T08:33:09  <smiley1983> Which does make sense - even that is a little worrying, since we'll want to do a bit of other processing on top of that, but at least it leaves 4/5 of your allocation untouched.
2011-04-18T08:33:24  <bhasker> yea it was a bug
2011-04-18T08:33:31  <antimatroid> not very promising when i want to use a game tree for battle ants
2011-04-18T08:33:43  <antimatroid> well, multiple game trees
2011-04-18T08:33:44  <bhasker> now each BFS search is taking only 2ms or so
2011-04-18T08:34:08  <antimatroid> i've had games with more than 1000 ants :P
2011-04-18T08:34:24  <smiley1983> Yes, I had game tree plans, and sort of still do... I'm just a bit doubtful about how much use they'll see. :)

2011-04-18T09:25:15  <bhasker> k got it working now
2011-04-18T09:37:39  <bhasker> 66ms to route over 125 ants
2011-04-18T09:37:42  <bhasker> so not bad
2011-04-18T09:38:53  <smiley1983> Sounds pretty good really. Should cope with the 1000+ ants scenario (if it happens in contest games)
2011-04-18T09:39:25  <smiley1983> If its a linear increase in time, which I guess it might not be
2011-04-18T09:39:57  <bhasker> well it will be a linear increase kind of
2011-04-18T09:40:01  <bhasker> since i am doing per ant
2011-04-18T09:40:19  <bhasker> but i guess i will add some customization to spread it over a few turns
2011-04-18T09:40:30  <smiley1983> Is this matching against the food list, or matching against the map tile by tile?
2011-04-18T09:40:33  <bhasker> so that at any point i don't move than X number of hosts
2011-04-18T09:40:42  <bhasker> it explores the map
2011-04-18T09:40:50  <bhasker> starts at ant location and explores outwards
2011-04-18T09:40:58  <bhasker> towards the closest food/ant
2011-04-18T09:41:57  <bhasker> then i just extract the path and make the first move
2011-04-18T09:42:38  <smiley1983> Right, so it's pathfinding, not just matching ants against closest food.
2011-04-18T09:42:50  <bhasker> yes it does do a bit of pathfinding
2011-04-18T09:43:03  <bhasker> it will route around my ants
2011-04-18T09:43:14  <bhasker> i don't explore nodes which have my ants
2011-04-18T09:43:25  <bhasker> so that i don't end up stomping my own ants
2011-04-18T09:44:14  <smiley1983> Though I've noticed that you can move an ant into a tile in the same turn as moving another out - even having two ants swap places. So you may sometimes want to route through your current ant locations
2011-04-18T09:44:29  <bhasker> replaying http://pastebin.com/QM7LSe9b
2011-04-18T09:45:02  <bhasker> i could but that complicates stuff, since now i have to special case the first search to be not via my own ant
2011-04-18T09:45:22  <bhasker> i guess not routing via my ant might have other issues
2011-04-18T09:45:28  <bhasker> where corridors are narrow
2011-04-18T09:45:53  <bhasker> ants may end up going all around instead of following ants
2011-04-18T09:46:07  <smiley1983> This contest will pose many interesting challenges :)
2011-04-18T09:46:57  <bhasker> yea it will i want to see the strategies evolve
2011-04-18T09:47:11  <bhasker> it will be a big learning curve similar to planetwars
2011-04-18T09:47:19  <bhasker> initially we will see a bunch of strategies
2011-04-18T09:47:25  <bhasker> then it will refine down to a few
2011-04-18T09:47:28  <bhasker> as time goes on
2011-04-18T09:50:17  <smiley1983> Thanks for the replay, I haven't seen many yet
2011-04-18T09:58:45  <bhasker> you are welcome, though i am seeing weird stuff, looks like a lot of the game will be determined by who your neighbour is
2011-04-18T09:58:57  <bhasker> i played a game with hunterbot/lefty/hunter/mybot
2011-04-18T09:59:02  <bhasker> and lefty got eliminated
2011-04-18T09:59:06  <bhasker> and player 1 is now 2x my size
2011-04-18T09:59:15  <bhasker> turn 500
2011-04-18T09:59:16  <bhasker> turn  500 stats: ant_count: [565, 0, 150, 244]
2011-04-18T09:59:16  <bhasker> s
2011-04-18T09:59:29  <bhasker> i am guessing because mybot spent most time fighting with player 3

2011-04-18T10:23:37  <bhasker> though i wish they would let ants stack
2011-04-18T10:23:37  <bhasker> instead of killing the ant if you move onto another of your ants

2011-04-18T12:14:09  <smiley1983> Ah, sorry, I didn't actually mean starter bot. That's just supposed to avoid water, not even food. However, they suggest a "passable" helper function
2011-04-18T12:14:35  <smiley1983> I'm guessing the passable function should avoid food, unlike the starter bot logic.

2011-04-18T17:55:44  <a1k0n> well shit, now i feel obligated
2011-04-18T17:55:54  <sigh> :P
2011-04-18T17:55:55  <amstan> lol
2011-04-18T17:56:50  <bhasker> i just noticed that when my ants got into a configuration like ...a*a...
2011-04-18T17:56:55  <bhasker> for some reason no ant was spawning
2011-04-18T17:57:06  <bhasker> but not sure if it was some other bug that  i wasn't logging
2011-04-18T17:57:07  <sigh> did the food disappear?
2011-04-18T17:57:11  <bhasker> nope
2011-04-18T17:57:28  <bhasker> oh wait hmm it might have been the bug in the c++ starter bot that i discovered later
2011-04-18T17:57:35  <sigh> heh
2011-04-18T17:57:44  <sigh> what bug is that?
2011-04-18T17:57:44  <bhasker> the reset code was not resetting the squares properly
2011-04-18T17:57:52  <bhasker> i told antimatroid already
2011-04-18T17:57:56  <bhasker> let me pull up the code
2011-04-18T17:57:57  <sigh> ah, yeah... that would explain it :)
2011-04-18T17:58:18  <bhasker>     for(int row=0; row<rows; row++)
2011-04-18T17:58:18  <bhasker>         for(int col=0; col<cols; col++)
2011-04-18T17:58:19  <bhasker>             if(!grid[row][col].isWater)
2011-04-18T17:58:19  <bhasker>                 grid[row][col].reset();
2011-04-18T17:58:20  <bhasker> this code
2011-04-18T17:58:23  <bhasker> the isWater check
2011-04-18T17:58:28  <bhasker> is actually listed as isFood check
2011-04-18T17:58:33  <bhasker> in the State::reset()
2011-04-18T17:58:35  <bhasker> check
2011-04-18T17:58:50  <bhasker> so it won't reset for food squares
2011-04-18T17:58:50  <sigh> haha
2011-04-18T17:58:51  <janzert> btw, I believe antimatroid checked in the fix for that earlier
2011-04-18T17:59:08  <bhasker> took me sometime to track that down, my bots would keep walking into each other
2011-04-18T17:59:13  <bhasker> and dying near food
2011-04-18T17:59:46  <sigh> bhasker: if you notice any problems like that again, just verify with the replay what is actually happening
2011-04-18T18:00:23  <bhasker> will do , though i haven't seen it since and my elementary bot seems reasonably good now
2011-04-18T18:00:33  <sigh> cool
2011-04-18T18:00:35  <bhasker> seems to expand quite nicely
2011-04-18T18:00:41  <bhasker> and doesn't oscillate or get stuck
2011-04-18T18:01:13  <bhasker> and i seem to be able to pathfind for a few hundred ants without significant slowdown
2011-04-18T18:01:14  <a1k0n> so ants can spawn on water?
2011-04-18T18:01:19  <bhasker> no they can't
2011-04-18T18:01:23  <bhasker> neither can food
2011-04-18T18:01:46  <a1k0n> oh.  right.  heh.  this is confusing:
2011-04-18T18:01:47  <a1k0n> Only movement is blocked by water. Ants can see, battle and spawn over water.
2011-04-18T18:02:00  <a1k0n> meaning they can access food through water
2011-04-18T18:02:01  <bhasker> haha i pointed this out yesterday as well
2011-04-18T18:02:08  <bhasker> its meant to be across
2011-04-18T18:02:11  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-04-18T18:02:15  <bhasker> i think antimatroid is gonna fix that

2011-04-18T20:01:07  <Frontier> I did just say something bad to someone.
2011-04-18T20:03:51  <Frontier> There is a pub I visit regularly and the owner was asking the staff if they know me (because I was the last non-staff guy hanging around). Of course I'm drunk and think *wtf* he has seen me so often here and say "The reason you don't know me is because you are always drunk." Man was he pissed off.
2011-04-18T20:07:22  <Frontier> bhasker: I made sure the applet runs without a certificate. That means it has no write access to any files and can not execute code on your server. Unless there is a security hole in the JVM.
2011-04-18T20:08:40  <jbroman> Why is the applet running on the server instead of the client?
2011-04-18T20:08:54  <Frontier> It runs on the client of course :p
2011-04-18T20:09:09  <jbroman> So then why would it ever be able to execute code on the server?
2011-04-18T20:09:38  <Frontier> Maybe trough some applet function (that doesn't exist)
2011-04-18T20:09:53  <jbroman> Any such function would be accessible with or without the applet.
2011-04-18T20:10:04  <jbroman> (By writing my own client for whatever interface it exposes.)
2011-04-18T20:10:29  <jbroman> But whatever…we agree there is zero threat.
2011-04-18T20:11:00  <Frontier> Seems like this is one of those days where I don't think enough before talking. ;)
2011-04-18T20:11:31  <jbroman> I was confused even by the original question. But I have been known to be temporarily stupid as well, so…meh.
2011-04-18T20:13:24  <Frontier> If I created a certified applet it would be able to do all kinds of things on the clients machine, but it really isn't neccesary here.
2011-04-18T20:13:59  <Frontier> It means no fullscreen mode though for IE users.
2011-04-18T20:14:10  <jbroman> Let them press F11.
2011-04-18T20:15:28  <Frontier> The applet will keep it's size on the web page
2011-04-18T20:16:00  <jbroman> Can you resize applets at runtime from JS?
2011-04-18T20:16:14  <jbroman> Ah, whatever. Doesn't really matter.
2011-04-18T20:16:19  <jbroman> IE users are, well, IE users.
2011-04-18T20:16:33  <Frontier> It is a bit tricky to make it the only element on the page without reloading it and resizing is a bit non-standard ^^
2011-04-18T20:16:33  <jbroman> Wonder what proportion of people last time around used IE?
2011-04-18T20:16:54  <jbroman> I'd expect ai-contest.com's IE share to be significantly lower than the average.
2011-04-18T20:16:56  <Frontier> I don't know, but IE 9 will support the canvas as far as I heard
2011-04-18T20:17:25  <Frontier> Ask janzert or amstan, they have access to the latest browser stats.

2011-04-18T22:32:11  <j3camero> Hey McLeopold
2011-04-18T22:33:10  <McLeopold> hi
2011-04-18T22:33:21  <McLeopold> j3camero: thx for showing up
2011-04-18T22:33:39  <McLeopold> nothing to report, though, I've been sick for the last 3 days, so no progress
2011-04-18T22:33:45  <j3camero> I actually just got in. Just got back in the door from the airport.
2011-04-18T22:33:53  <j3camero> Oh, I hope you're feeling better.
2011-04-18T22:34:00  <McLeopold> I'm getting there
2011-04-18T22:34:15  <bhasker> leopold
2011-04-18T22:34:24  <McLeopold> There's been some more activity as far as bots go, bhasker is working on some good ones
2011-04-18T22:35:22  <bhasker> haha not good ones,
2011-04-18T22:35:25  <bhasker> just a basic one
2011-04-18T22:35:39  <j3camero> Excellent.
2011-04-18T22:36:44  <j3camero> Is anyone showing interest in writing content for the website? Maybe some tutorials. I find it's good to have a tutorial for using the visualizer and other client-side tools, and also another tutorial that starts with the starter package and leads the person through a series of small changes that raise their ranking.
2011-04-18T22:39:08  <McLeopold> I would recommend Stocha for that, if he's willing
2011-04-18T22:39:25  <McLeopold> He's done a *lot* of testing and is fairly active on the forums
2011-04-18T22:40:09  <McLeopold> antimatroid has done a lot on the wiki already, I'm sure that could be converted over easily
2011-04-18T22:40:25  <j3camero> Excellent. Good to hear. That's something that I have up until now always neglected until the last moment.
2011-04-18T22:40:30  <McLeopold> amstan: did you get a test server going yet?
2011-04-18T22:40:42  <amstan> nope, i'm still working on that
2011-04-18T22:41:01  <amstan> j3camero: antimatroid has been writing content for the website
2011-04-18T22:41:12  <j3camero> amstan: excellent.
2011-04-18T22:41:28  <j3camero> Okay I gotta hit the sack. Big day tomorrow.

2011-04-18T23:03:26  <McLeopold> bhasker: I'll have to look at it later.  Also, ants.zeroviz.us will do replay pastes soon.
2011-04-18T23:03:39  <bhasker> oh i uploaded the visualizer
2011-04-18T23:03:42  <bhasker> to my website
2011-04-18T23:03:48  <bhasker> bhasker.net/ants/copy_paste.html
2011-04-18T23:11:10  <j3camero> Love that visualizer. bhasker did you make that?
2011-04-18T23:16:35  <amstan> j3camero: frontier did it
2011-04-18T23:18:58  <bhasker> nope
2011-04-18T23:19:01  <bhasker> i just uploaded it
2011-04-18T23:20:32  <bhasker> need some good bots to test against
2011-04-18T23:24:45  <jaycobcoleman> Wish I could provide. Still in construction :P

2011-04-18T23:40:08  <janzert> I looked at browser stats the other day and it was still about 4.25% that were using IE <= 8
2011-04-18T23:46:23  <jaycobcoleman> I don't think those statistics have our target audience in mind
2011-04-18T23:46:48  <janzert> ? the 4.25% is the visitors to ai-contest.com
2011-04-18T23:47:19  <janzert> I have no idea what the general population percentage is :)
2011-04-18T23:47:54  <jaycobcoleman> This is shocking
2011-04-18T23:48:02  <amstan> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Web_browser_usage_share.svg
2011-04-18T23:48:43  <jaycobcoleman> Oh god. It's horrifying
2011-04-18T23:50:20  * janzert wonders what the source of data is for that
2011-04-18T23:50:24  <bhasker> hah most people don't care about the browser they just use whatever came with their pc
2011-04-18T23:50:26  <janzert> is it visitors to wikipedia?
2011-04-18T23:50:26  <bhasker> laptop
2011-04-18T23:50:26  <bhasker> etc
2011-04-18T23:50:52  <bhasker> even though IE is steadily losing ground, its still the default browser on most systems sold today
2011-04-18T23:53:41  <amstan> janzert: no, here's more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser_usage_share
2011-04-18T23:54:25  <janzert> yeah, I figured it out eventualy. basically it is the median values from 4 or 5 different sources including wikipedia
2011-04-18T23:56:38  <jaycobcoleman> Ahhh yes. A nice steady decline
2011-04-18T23:56:46  <amstan> yes
2011-04-18T23:57:38  <janzert> although taking the medians of market share percentages seems a rather dubious way to make a chart since you'll notice the total percentage no longer adds up to 100% (it's somewhere around 102%)
2011-04-18T23:58:11  <jaycobcoleman> You got me in a statisticsy mood now. Let's see how AT&T is doing
