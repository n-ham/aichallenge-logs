2010-11-27T00:00:28  <janzert> not sure how frequently but yes it's trying to sync with the server time
2010-11-27T00:00:35  <janzert> that is probably what is failing
2010-11-27T00:01:18  <Zannick> i would have recommended just doing that once rather than hammer the server
2010-11-27T00:01:39  <janzert> it's using http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html
2010-11-27T00:02:16  <janzert> hopefully once it syncs once successfully it stops hammering, since I don't see that behavior

2010-11-27T00:05:28  <Zannick> i'm reading the docs
2010-11-27T00:05:41  <Zannick> try using timezone or UTCDate?
2010-11-27T00:05:45  <Accoun> Submissions closing counter buggy for me
2010-11-27T00:05:52  <Accoun> 744 hours
2010-11-27T00:06:06  <Zannick> this means you hardcode the actual date in
2010-11-27T00:06:21  <antimatroid> it says no time left for me
2010-11-27T00:06:25  <Zannick> Accoun: what is the date on your computer?
2010-11-27T00:06:27  <janzert> working on it
2010-11-27T00:06:38  <janzert> the 744 hours was a mistake I uploaded just now
2010-11-27T00:06:38  <antimatroid> oh, time zones?
2010-11-27T00:06:48  <antimatroid> mine says 0 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds
2010-11-27T00:07:22  <burny> lol.. for me the numbers aren't aligned
2010-11-27T00:07:24  <Zannick> oh, it's working for me now
2010-11-27T00:07:33  <janzert> everyone try refreshing now
2010-11-27T00:07:39  <burny> and when the page was loading, they were jumbling around
2010-11-27T00:07:44  <antimatroid> <3
2010-11-27T00:07:44  <Zannick> though the font is getting messed up after less than a second
2010-11-27T00:07:56  <Zannick> good enough, though
2010-11-27T00:08:14  <antimatroid> wait, now it says 41 hours?
2010-11-27T00:08:29  <janzert> gah, really?
2010-11-27T00:08:29  <Zannick> but i don't think it's correct
2010-11-27T00:08:51  <antimatroid> yeah :\
2010-11-27T00:08:59  <Zannick> it's counting down to 8pm pst, which is 10pm cst
2010-11-27T00:09:23  * janzert considers just killing the javascript countdown and just leave the static time
2010-11-27T00:09:37  <janzert> people will just have to refresh to see the current time

2010-11-27T00:13:37  <Zannick> oh, right
2010-11-27T00:14:13  <Zannick> i would think {until: new Date("Nove 27, 2010 23:59:00"), timezone: -6, format: "HMS"} would work
2010-11-27T00:14:23  <Zannick> and you don't need serverSync at all

2010-11-27T00:14:56  <janzert> Zannick: only as long as the client time is set correctly
2010-11-27T00:15:01  <janzert> and date
2010-11-27T00:15:03  <Zannick> that's what i meant before
2010-11-27T00:15:07  <Zannick> that is true
2010-11-27T00:15:22  <janzert> that's the reason for the serverSync
2010-11-27T00:15:24  <Zannick> right
2010-11-27T00:16:40  <Zannick> oh, even better, then
2010-11-27T00:16:56  <Zannick> use a php function like gettimeofday and calc the time remaining in the php
2010-11-27T00:17:05  <janzert> that's what I'm doing :)
2010-11-27T00:17:10  <Zannick> sweet :)
2010-11-27T00:17:26  <Zannick> i see you don't need me to say my advice out loud ;)
2010-11-27T00:17:29  <janzert> it was already in there
2010-11-27T00:17:56  <janzert> but was calculating something wrong, current suspicion is that number_format actually rounds to nearest instead of truncating like I need
2010-11-27T00:18:11  <janzert> or floor would work as well

2010-11-27T00:59:32  <burny> ahh..
2010-11-27T00:59:39  <burny> I miscounted on teh 59planet by 1turn
2010-11-27T00:59:55  <burny> and thought the 19planet was 3growth not 2
2010-11-27T01:01:10  <janzert> just curious, are you still without a browser that shows the javascript visualizer?
2010-11-27T01:01:21  <burny> no, I can see it now

2010-11-27T01:02:52  <burny> I'm about to give up on trying to progress anyway..
2010-11-27T01:03:33  <burny> can't think ofa non time consuming way to make it figure out if a planet is safe to attack, and where to send re-enforcements
2010-11-27T01:03:40  <Terr__> off-by-one errors are my persistent nightmare in this contest.
2010-11-27T01:04:02  <burny> ya, I'm surprised I haven't had any of those
2010-11-27T01:04:51  <Terr__> My mother has a funny anecdote about how I would verify plans (like if she said: "Next tuesday") by asking if she meant the-day-after-the-day-after-the-day-after-the-day-after-tomorrow.
2010-11-27T01:05:08  <Terr__> As far as I was concerned it eliminated ambiguity.

2010-11-27T01:24:00  <Snowplan> shouldn't have gone after that 7
2010-11-27T01:25:53  <burny> shouldn't have gone after anything
2010-11-27T01:26:00  <Snowplan> lol
2010-11-27T01:26:29  <burny> except the 2
2010-11-27T01:26:58  <burny> first turn, anything besides sending 100 units at the 2, loses to sending 100units at the 2
2010-11-27T01:28:10  <janzert> unless they send 50 at your home?
2010-11-27T01:28:28  <burny> you can get 50 back to your base by tmime theirs gets there
2010-11-27T01:29:30  <janzert> ok, I thought it was a turn short
2010-11-27T01:29:43  <burny> 3, 3, and 6
2010-11-27T01:30:20  <burny> if it was 3,3,7.. then best strat is to send 35 instead of 100
2010-11-27T01:30:33  <burny> er, nm..
2010-11-27T01:30:36  <burny> is no best then
2010-11-27T01:30:44  <burny> then it'd be paper rock scissors
2010-11-27T01:30:57  * janzert nods
2010-11-27T01:30:58  <Snowplan> or attack form the outside
2010-11-27T01:31:21  <burny> if you attack any of the outside planets, and the opponent doesn't, you lose
2010-11-27T01:31:40  <burny> losing those 7 ships, allows opponent to secure the 2
2010-11-27T01:31:47  <burny> and then take your base
2010-11-27T01:32:32  <burny> takes 14 turns to capture the base I think(assuming you go for a 7, and nothing else)

2010-11-27T01:36:25  <burny> the base costs less(0) than the 11's, and takes longer to capture

2010-11-27T01:37:40  <Snowplan> right I see what you mean. best line through the 2

2010-11-27T02:06:52  <burny> so.. if I check to see if it's equal to 0..

2010-11-27T02:22:51  <janzert> yes
2010-11-27T02:27:28  <burny> are the new maps just whatever happens ot be random? or is there going to be extra criteria, like.. there isn't a single distinctly 'best' planets to attack on turn1?
2010-11-27T02:28:51  <Snowplan> lol
2010-11-27T02:29:12  <janzert> there is no further selection criteria than what the current map_generator does itself

2010-11-27T02:29:50  <Snowplan> leak the maps
2010-11-27T02:30:02  <janzert> heh, I can't :)
2010-11-27T02:30:10  <burny> they already are leaked :P
2010-11-27T02:30:21  <janzert> since I won't even generate them till submissions close
2010-11-27T02:30:38  <burny> we have the generater source.. and we know when the contest is..

2010-11-27T02:31:12  <janzert> yeah, but you gotta know the millisecond (possibly nanosecond) that I'm going to run it :P
2010-11-27T02:31:16  <McLeopold> Or do you think you'll even look at the quality of maps?

2010-11-27T02:32:45  <McLeopold> In the future, however, analysis would be better.
2010-11-27T02:32:56  <burny> I agree with leo on both points
2010-11-27T02:33:21  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.88.254> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2010-11-27T02:33:33  <Terr__> DO: Keep the final maps secret, all map analysis should be during runtime.
2010-11-27T02:33:40  <burny> as long as there's a sufficient number of maps, the variety should be adequate
2010-11-27T02:33:41  <janzert> since we've gone through 155 maps without running into any that are a major problem
2010-11-27T02:33:53  <janzert> I'm expecting we'll be fine
2010-11-27T02:33:54  <Terr__> In terms of "analysis"
2010-11-27T02:33:58  <burny> major problem?
2010-11-27T02:34:01  <Terr__> That should be done in the map generator itself, IMO
2010-11-27T02:34:11  <McLeopold> janzert: I've run into major problems on my type. :)
2010-11-27T02:34:16  <Terr__> That way the conditions are publicly visible, but privately verified
2010-11-27T02:34:37  <McLeopold> Terr__: your right
2010-11-27T02:35:13  <McLeopold> You would need to write a tool that can analyze the maps by some metric, and then make sure they are evenly spaced.
2010-11-27T02:35:19  <Terr__> Perhaps for the next contest, there should be a specific period marked out in the timeline, a sort of "request for comments" regarding map layout
2010-11-27T02:36:02  <Terr__> McLeopold: I mean it should be part of the generation process, even if it's simply a "no, try generating again"-type of check
2010-11-27T02:36:04  <Snowplan> thought it was all linear
2010-11-27T02:36:09  <burny> janz, I've got a bunch of experience with what I call 'presentation level' ai, if you want to consult with me on stuff for the next contest..
2010-11-27T02:36:14  <McLeopold> What we need is insane scientists to create crazy boards and conditions so that no one can make any assumptions.
2010-11-27T02:36:23  <janzert> I think as long as it works out like it did during tron it should be fine, basically just the community needs to be encouraged to start trying out different maps early on
2010-11-27T02:36:30  <Terr__> McLeopold: Do you mean *deliberately* tricky situations?
2010-11-27T02:36:31  <McLeopold> Terr__: yes I agree
2010-11-27T02:36:39  <McLeopold> Yes
2010-11-27T02:36:39  <janzert> then that experience can be drawn back into the official contest
2010-11-27T02:36:42  <Terr__> Designed by man?
2010-11-27T02:36:53  <burny> eg. to determine how 'good' a map is, in terms of having a variety of potentially pheasible strategies
2010-11-27T02:36:55  <McLeopold> No, like what I generate on my crazy tcp server.
2010-11-27T02:36:58  <janzert> burny: I won't be around for the next one
2010-11-27T02:37:19  <McLeopold> burny: it wouldn't be a determination of "good", just "different" from the other maps
2010-11-27T02:37:22  <burny> how come?
2010-11-27T02:37:35  <janzert> burny: no time until next fall at least
2010-11-27T02:37:51  <Terr__> McLeopold: Your next mission, therefore, is to create an AI program which will classify and cluster maps based on features and determine which are underrepresented ;)
2010-11-27T02:37:58  <burny> leo, if you have 'different' huristics.. then you can ensure a certain overall range within those differences
2010-11-27T02:38:08  <janzert> besides after the 100s of hours on this one I'm not ready to do it again real soon
2010-11-27T02:38:08  <burny> as being on of the criteria for 'goodness'
2010-11-27T02:38:10  <McLeopold> Terr__: I'm halfway there...
2010-11-27T02:38:52  <Terr__> janzert: Is there an opinion in terms of "build upon PlanetWars" versus "Completely new game"?
2010-11-27T02:39:23  <janzert> I haven't heard any serious discussion of "build upon planetwars"
2010-11-27T02:39:24  <Snowplan> I already do
2010-11-27T02:39:39  <janzert> the history has always been "new game" so far

2010-11-27T02:43:11  <Terr__> amstan: I'd have emphasized the [AI] rather than the [Programming]
2010-11-27T02:43:17  <Terr__> One's a lot more specialized

2010-11-27T02:47:35  <amstan> Terr__: i'm just saying.. it would be hard to make an exciting contest with things that would be useful after... since useful things are usually required, so people have already thought about them
2010-11-27T02:47:48  <janzert> Terr__: yep
2010-11-27T02:48:20  <Terr__> amstan: Maybe it's just my ignorance of the "right ways" to solve PlanetWars, but it seems like there aren't so few that they've all been done to death.

2010-11-27T02:52:03  <Zannick> from the faq
2010-11-27T02:52:11  <amstan> yeah.. it says maybe

2010-11-27T02:53:55  <burny> with only a week.. risk vs reward. made it not worth spending my time
2010-11-27T02:54:05  <amstan> medrimonia: hey.. congrats for first
2010-11-27T02:54:08  <Snowplan> like the pen and the sword
2010-11-27T02:54:23  <McLeopold> janzert: can you confirm timeouts vs crashes vs invalid orders?
2010-11-27T02:54:36  <janzert> confirm in what way?
2010-11-27T02:54:50  <McLeopold> look at a game id a tell me which one happened?
2010-11-27T02:54:52  <janzert> I confirm there are differences
2010-11-27T02:55:01  <Terr__> Next time we need to be able to see the last X lines of output from a crashed/timeout'ed/invalid bot...
2010-11-27T02:55:12  <burny> amstan, if the next contest interests me, I'll most likely enter it
2010-11-27T02:55:13  <amstan> Terr__: can you add that to framework ideas?
2010-11-27T02:55:17  <janzert> no the extent of what is record is already displayed
2010-11-27T02:55:24  <janzert> there is no more information to look at
2010-11-27T02:55:27  <Terr__> I think it's already in a Google Code issue somewhere
2010-11-27T02:55:28  <Zannick> we have a lot of overhaul planned
2010-11-27T02:55:29  <burny> I've done a number of things LIKE this before
2010-11-27T02:55:57  <amstan> burny: you can always suggest new games for next contest
2010-11-27T02:56:15  <sanddbox> i like these rts-type games
2010-11-27T02:56:15  <Snowplan> checkers
2010-11-27T02:56:44  <burny> there's an infinite number of games..
2010-11-27T02:56:55  <Terr__> Nim. Yay.
2010-11-27T02:57:00  <burny> would need some constraints, before I thought about it much
2010-11-27T02:57:03  <janzert> we're going to break 1000 submissions in the past 24 hours soon
2010-11-27T02:58:30  <Terr__> janzert: Suggestion: Make an explicit SVN tag in the codebase at the end of the contest
2010-11-27T02:58:54  <Terr__> That way if someone wants to fork it or even use use it to fix a TCP server "that used to work" there's a solid baseline code-wise
2010-11-27T02:59:06  <Terr__> Just a bit easier than sleuthing through revision numbers
2010-11-27T03:00:12  <janzert> I'm not sure why it will be of interest but sure
2010-11-27T03:01:18  <amstan> Terr__: we're moving to git for the next one
2010-11-27T03:01:21  <amstan> so.. meh

2010-11-27T03:02:02  <amstan> maybe we can convert the repo to git
2010-11-27T03:02:06  <amstan> then delete everything
2010-11-27T03:02:11  <amstan> so there's a nice progression

2010-11-27T03:03:08  <janzert> I'm hoping someone has the time to start from the ground up using a nice python framework for the next one

2010-11-27T03:03:33  <Terr__> janzert: Does Python impose any issues in terms of performance and the GIL?
2010-11-27T03:03:43  <Snowplan> sounds like you
2010-11-27T03:03:46  <Terr__> I guess if everything has to be in a sandbox with separate processes anyway, it's not an issue
2010-11-27T03:03:57  <Terr__> But for, say, a TCP server...
2010-11-27T03:03:59  <janzert> Terr__: not that are a problem for this, no

2010-11-27T03:17:45  <CryBaby> so it must have created 1.txt, correct?
2010-11-27T03:18:26  <Pihtashilo> it was, but it contains a lot of numbers in game format, not log like "Turn 1 Turn 2 Player 1 wins!"

2010-11-27T03:20:32  <Pihtashilo> the log is still writen to the console
2010-11-27T03:22:11  <CryBaby> I guess PlayGame must be using the error stream to display the turn numbers and the final result
2010-11-27T03:22:12  <CryBaby> if the replay data is sent to the standard output
2010-11-27T03:22:46  <Pihtashilo> thanks, i will check it now
2010-11-27T03:22:46  <CryBaby> which is then saved in the text file
2010-11-27T03:29:29  <CryBaby> yep, the turn numbers and winner are coming out in the error stream
2010-11-27T03:29:39  <Pihtashilo> hm
2010-11-27T03:29:46  <Pihtashilo> yes, it is so, thanks
2010-11-27T03:29:56  <Pihtashilo> but a new problem appeared

2010-11-27T05:33:39  <mega1> ok

2010-11-27T05:34:23  <amstan> bobng: see topic
2010-11-27T05:34:39  <bobng> i wouldn't say they were malicious

2010-11-27T05:35:40  <amstan> bobng: if it were a demonstration he would have contacted an organizer directly and demonstrated it..
2010-11-27T05:35:56  <amstan> not secretly pmd a few users
2010-11-27T05:36:00  <bobng> well it was under "demonstration.html"
2010-11-27T05:36:28  <amstan> i'm gonna demonstrate how you can steal from a bank.. i'll need to shoot a few ppl too
2010-11-27T05:36:55  <bobng> i'm going to demonstrate a flaw in myspace by making everyone add me
2010-11-27T05:37:18  <bobng> it was only changing the country and the organization
2010-11-27T05:37:26  <amstan> yeah, so, he did not get permissions to do any security demonstrating
2010-11-27T05:37:28  <bobng> its not as though the password and email were being changed.
2010-11-27T05:37:31  <bobng> haha
2010-11-27T05:37:34  <bobng> you need permission now?
2010-11-27T05:37:44  <amstan> you always needed it
2010-11-27T05:37:55  <bobng> that rule is rather stupid
2010-11-27T05:38:03  <amstan> orly?
2010-11-27T05:38:07  <bobng> you don't need to ask permission to conduct a security test
2010-11-27T05:38:15  <bobng> on a front end facing website
2010-11-27T05:38:25  <amstan> it's even illegal to do it in most places
2010-11-27T05:38:53  <bobng> its illegal to do a lot of things, it doesn't mean those laws are enforced
2010-11-27T05:39:46  <amstan> well.. i'm enforcing them now
2010-11-27T05:40:57  <amstan> 1. it was a failed attempt, 2. it was not noted as a security demonstration, the links were clearly deceiving(hidden with tinyurl too), 3. he did not get permission
2010-11-27T05:45:52  <antimatroid> amstan: what is the deal? is anyone actually fucking with the site or just being a nuissance?
2010-11-27T05:46:13  <amstan> antimatroid: apparently someone tried to do this, but failed
2010-11-27T05:46:28  <amstan> idk if i would call it a demonstration, he was sending tinyurls to his site through PMs
2010-11-27T05:46:41  <antimatroid> yeah i got one of the pms
2010-11-27T05:47:12  <amstan> people doing security testing should inform us should not be so sneaky

2010-11-27T05:55:07  <amstan> medrimonia: same as now?
2010-11-27T05:55:51  <medrimonia> But I heard that only the top 100 (or other limit) would play at the end
2010-11-27T05:55:55  <medrimonia> Is it right?
2010-11-27T05:56:14  <amstan> we'll to that too, but near the ened
2010-11-27T05:56:17  <amstan> end*
2010-11-27T05:57:04  <medrimonia> ok, so there's not too many risked that we get kicked from the contest because we loose the four or five first games
2010-11-27T05:57:17  <medrimonia> risks*
2010-11-27T05:58:46  <amstan> no
2010-11-27T06:00:18  <medrimonia> In all cases, this contest is really exciting, there isn't any fixed rank, everything can still happen
2010-11-27T06:01:46  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm really excited for tomorrow
2010-11-27T06:02:09  <antimatroid> i hope i don't lose many (at all) before my rank gets closer to the top
2010-11-27T06:02:15  <antimatroid> i feel bad for those who happen to lose early
2010-11-27T06:03:33  <amstan> antimatroid: there's no problem with loosing early, as long as you stay above the 100/25 or w/e
2010-11-27T06:03:55  <antimatroid> amstan: if you lose early, wont you play more games against lower ranked bots?
2010-11-27T06:04:06  <antimatroid> and hence have a higher chance of losing more games to lower ranked bots
2010-11-27T06:04:19  <amstan> but then you win, and go back near the top
2010-11-27T06:04:32  <antimatroid> but you still have more lost games to lower ranked bots potentially
2010-11-27T06:04:48  <amstan> which seems fair
2010-11-27T06:05:02  <amstan> you loose a match, you must win one to get to the same place you were before
2010-11-27T06:05:13  <antimatroid> i think this is way better than what was done previously, but i still think two equal bots that win/lose their first game against a not so good bot have different chances of then placing the same at the ed

2010-11-27T06:07:57  <medrimonia> I know that in chess, if you loose against someone that has 400 or more elo points less than you, you loose the same amount of point
2010-11-27T06:08:14  <amstan> i don't think there's limits
2010-11-27T06:08:28  <medrimonia> hmmm
2010-11-27T06:08:33  <amstan> i'm not sure that much about how scores are calculated or how the pairings are set
2010-11-27T06:08:40  <amstan> you can explore the source code and see for yourself

2010-11-27T06:08:52  <janzert> medrimonia:  bayeselo doesn't work like that
2010-11-27T06:09:10  <janzert> it isn't incremental by game but looks at all the games at once
2010-11-27T06:09:38  <janzert> and calculates each players most likely elo based on that full history
2010-11-27T06:10:38  <medrimonia> hmmm I'll see in the code
2010-11-27T06:11:03  <amstan> janzert: do you know what makes ratings.txt?
2010-11-27T06:11:16  <janzert> bayeselo
2010-11-27T06:12:15  <medrimonia> Hmmm too much complicated for me I think^^
2010-11-27T06:12:30  <janzert> that is the output file from bayeselo that is loaded back into the database by process_rankings
2010-11-27T06:13:13  <amstan> janzert: where's the code for bayeselo?
2010-11-27T06:13:31  <janzert> medrimonia: you can read a little bit about the overall idea on the bayeselo page
2010-11-27T06:13:34  <janzert> http://remi.coulom.free.fr/Bayesian-Elo/
2010-11-27T06:13:48  <medrimonia> thanks janzert!
2010-11-27T06:13:56  <janzert> I think there's a fairly detailed paper he published as well but I don't know where at the moment

2010-11-27T06:15:35  <janzert> as in why do we have the code for bayeselo in our tree?
2010-11-27T06:15:39  <janzert> no idea really
2010-11-27T06:15:55  <amstan> it looks like it's a gui app of some kind too

2010-11-27T09:13:56  <Error323> yea exactly
2010-11-27T09:17:27  <antimatroid> i sort of wish the final tournament was going to run for a week or two
2010-11-27T09:17:52  <antimatroid> what do you think (for future reference :))?
2010-11-27T09:18:17  <antimatroid> although only with a live leaderboard, i couldn't handle 2 weeks of waiting
2010-11-27T09:18:22  <Error323> how will it run?
2010-11-27T09:18:29  <Error323> i think it nees much more
2010-11-27T09:18:40  <antimatroid> like it is now, but everyones rankings are completely reset
2010-11-27T09:18:53  <Error323> how long*
2010-11-27T09:18:55  <Error323> i mean -_-
2010-11-27T09:18:57  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-27T09:18:58  <antimatroid> 5 days or so?
2010-11-27T09:19:14  <antimatroid> they're releasing results on the 1st
2010-11-27T09:19:49  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3433), bix0r4ever(3334), george(3332), Raschi(3314), dmj111(3258), GreenTea(3245), wagstaff(3239), medrimonia(3235), murrayr(3232), Manwe56(3226)
2010-11-27T09:41:28  <antimatroid> janzert: would i suggest it might be worth removing the 10 minute resubmit time right at the end, even with leaving submissions open just past the deadline

2010-11-27T09:45:08  <janzert> antimatroid: I'm worried about the compile daemon not being able to keep up as it is and people then making it worse by doing multiple resubmits, etc.
2010-11-27T09:46:35  <antimatroid> yeah, surely you wait for the compile queue to finish before starting the final torunament?
2010-11-27T09:46:59  <antimatroid> either way i'm not personally waiting that late :)
2010-11-27T09:47:17  <janzert> yes, although not necessarily closing the submissions or we may never be able to close it :/
2010-11-27T09:47:31  <janzert> but hopefully it doesn't come to that
2010-11-27T09:49:13  <antimatroid> yep, cool

2010-11-27T09:56:08  <antimatroid> all set for game day?
2010-11-27T09:56:30  <bhasker> i am done, i have no more ideas to improve it, i have uploaded malazan-max and i am done
2010-11-27T09:56:36  <bhasker> its a more fun bot to watch though it makes mistakes
2010-11-27T09:56:41  <bhasker> 0.23 is boring as hell
2010-11-27T09:56:51  <Error323> hahah
2010-11-27T09:57:00  <Error323> its also better i presume?
2010-11-27T09:57:02  <bhasker> and i know one of the reasons it makes mistakes but i don't have a good way to solve the problem
2010-11-27T09:57:15  <Error323> what's the problem
2010-11-27T09:57:17  <bhasker> i think so
2010-11-27T09:57:25  <bhasker> well i maintain two lists for available ships
2010-11-27T09:57:32  <antimatroid> me to
2010-11-27T09:57:37  <antimatroid> usable and sendable
2010-11-27T09:57:38  <bhasker> when attacking/defending i use a list that has less restrictions
2010-11-27T09:57:42  <bhasker> when attacking neutrals
2010-11-27T09:57:46  <bhasker> i use a stricter list
2010-11-27T09:57:53  <antimatroid> ah, i use them differently
2010-11-27T09:58:04  <bhasker> the problem is i run through the list of planets and build orders for each planet
2010-11-27T09:58:11  <bhasker> then in second pass i optimize the orders
2010-11-27T09:58:11  <Error323> men, i'm doing really other stuff than you guys
2010-11-27T09:58:18  <bhasker> by figuring out which orders can be combined

2010-11-27T09:58:29  <bhasker> the problem is when combining orders
2010-11-27T09:58:40  *** Palmik <Palmik!~Palmik@palmikpc.sks6.muni.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-27T09:58:40  <bhasker> i use the looser availability list
2010-11-27T09:59:00  <bhasker> so i might end up combining neutral orders with attack/defense when technically they shouldn't be executed together
2010-11-27T09:59:19  <bhasker> the problem is order combining while keep ship counts in check
2010-11-27T09:59:51  <bhasker> this version that i uploaded has been holding 270-290 elo on tcp
2010-11-27T10:00:02  <bhasker> so i think its decent and should do better than 0.23

2010-11-27T10:18:29  <antimatroid> yes, but some changes have been made :P

2010-11-27T10:20:33  <antimatroid> yeah, rankings aren't reliable at all atm

2010-11-27T11:08:30  <mistmanov> just seems a bit of a waste of time to run games for people who uploaded the started package like 2 months ago

2010-11-27T11:53:16  <Error323> or is this written somewhere
2010-11-27T11:53:29  <rebelxt_> janzert implemented pairing cutoff
2010-11-27T11:53:48  <rebelxt_> initially they are gonna run it with no cutoff at all just like at the moment
2010-11-27T11:54:20  <rebelxt_> then they are planning to set cutoff to ~100 so that top bots get more games. that's what i heard preliminary plan was

2010-11-27T12:05:08  <Accoun> wat is "pairing cutoff"
2010-11-27T12:05:11  <Accoun> ?
2010-11-27T12:05:39  <antimatroid> after a certain amount of time, the lower ranked bots wont get any more games
2010-11-27T12:05:54  <antimatroid> so the better bots get more games, hence giving a better ranking at the top end
2010-11-27T12:06:16  <Accoun> lower ranked bots mast be deleted with all his game results
2010-11-27T12:06:48  <Error323> ahh i see
2010-11-27T12:08:25  <Accoun> canadian attempts to make ALO beter - ridiculous
2010-11-27T12:08:59  <antimatroid> Accoun: it's a matter of limited resources (including time)
2010-11-27T12:09:18  <antimatroid> would you prefer the top bots to get less games and leave all bots running the whole time?
2010-11-27T12:09:27  <antimatroid> (not that anything will change from your answer :))
2010-11-27T12:09:34  <Accoun> take top 256 bots and make games

2010-11-27T15:09:28  <burny> so, one can expect peak times to be up to around 30minutes?
2010-11-27T15:09:50  <flag> Ehh... I doubt it takes 10 seconds to compile a bot
2010-11-27T15:10:22  <flag> Mine seems to have compiled though
2010-11-27T15:15:34  <antimatroid1> how do i know if i'm checking the wall or cpu clock with my timer?

2010-11-27T16:13:21  <burny> anti: the counter is reset when your game is dispatched.. results don't show up till game is complete though
2010-11-27T16:16:10  <burny> bah... my bot now plays with the optimal strategy: assuming the opponent does nothing on first turn
2010-11-27T16:17:11  <antimatroid1> lol, and what's the optimal strategy?
2010-11-27T16:17:28  <antimatroid1> i assume you're not taking into account position strength?

2010-11-27T16:47:19  <Ken69267> mine just spams ships to the closest target practically
2010-11-27T16:47:37  <boegel> medrimonia: hard map, not bad
2010-11-27T16:47:47  <medrimonia> not hard
2010-11-27T16:47:53  <boegel> medrimonia: it makes perfect sense to try and conquer the 22 planet
2010-11-27T16:47:58  <medrimonia> no
2010-11-27T16:48:02  <medrimonia> you can't
2010-11-27T16:48:09  <boegel> sure you can
2010-11-27T16:48:29  <boegel> medrimonia: just send way more ships to it than the enemy would spend
2010-11-27T16:48:36  <medrimonia> (if you try to conquer the 22 planet, you'll get snipped by a good player
2010-11-27T16:48:52  <boegel> medrimonia: not if you send 500 to it
2010-11-27T16:48:57  <medrimonia> yes
2010-11-27T16:49:07  <boegel> you should just make the planet less interesting than it is now
2010-11-27T16:49:08  <medrimonia> once you have 500, the opponent has 500 too
2010-11-27T16:49:14  <boegel> just sending 55 would probably do it

2010-11-27T16:58:39  <burny> it doesn't matter that it costs them 100 to capture it.. because it would have also cost you 100 to NOT capture it

2010-11-27T17:56:11  <Terr__> Two weeks from now I'll come across some sort of matrix math or algorithm with a note about how people "never do it this way because..." and I'll have to slap myself upside the head.
2010-11-27T17:56:35  <Terr__> "Hey, let's model the entire future state of the game world and do it obsessively!"
2010-11-27T17:56:47  <Ken69267> I enjoy watching the completely random choices my bot makes, sometimes for the better :p
2010-11-27T17:57:08  <burny> that's what mine does
2010-11-27T17:57:28  <Terr__> Originally I had some sort of idea of focusing on heuristics and 80/20 goodness and now I look back and find myself along the path to hell paved with good number-crunching intentions.
2010-11-27T17:58:11  <burny> I just assume that enemy ships will all attack, all possible planets.. and then use the worst-case cost for me to take a planet, as the expected cost
2010-11-27T17:58:44  <Ken69267> mine just bombards the closest "best" planet per planet and ignores neuts entirely after turn 100
2010-11-27T17:58:51  <Ken69267> causes some amusing side effects
2010-11-27T18:02:24  <Terr__> Mine tries to track absolutively everything, predict all future places a planet changes hands given a set of past/future fleets, and tries to give a basic guess of "what I would do if I were the enemy" and uses as much allocated time as possible to draw out that simulation... And ARRRRRGHITMAKESNOSENSE
2010-11-27T18:02:35  <Terr__> Hubris!
2010-11-27T18:03:56  <Terr__> I'm reduced to running things against the TCP server just to check that my bot is losing in the expected rather than unexpected way.
2010-11-27T18:04:33  <Ken69267> in restrospect i should have added a check to see if the enemy home planet was extremely close but allwell
2010-11-27T18:04:38  <Terr__> Not helped by all the enemy bots who "play it safe" for the whole 200 turns even if a logic error keeps my bot from expanding at all
2010-11-27T18:07:00  <burny> terr, making your bot do the best thing, assuming the opponent thinks the same way as you, is flawed, unless you think better than the opponent
2010-11-27T18:07:18  <Terr__> No, my bot does the least-worst thing ;)
2010-11-27T18:07:48  <Terr__> I imagine it helps for certain "you can take it but for only one turn"-type deals

2010-11-27T18:12:37  <Terr__> I think part of what pisses me off is I sunk a lot of time into build scripts, tests, etc, and apparently all of it will be completely useless by tomorrow.
2010-11-27T18:12:57  <Terr__> Partly my fault, but... bah.
2010-11-27T18:14:57  <Ken69267> how's your least-worst bot doing anyhow?
2010-11-27T18:16:32  <Terr__> Very badly, because it doesn't make good decisions in the first place
2010-11-27T18:16:58  <Terr__> And it doesn't make alternates, so there's no point branching.
2010-11-27T18:17:30  <Terr__> Ironically my earlier version with the getStupidMoves() method (quasi-Ragebot behavior) was doing a lot better.

2010-11-27T20:10:48  <burny> ya.. I duno what that's about :\
2010-11-27T20:11:34  <virdo> I would be guessing routing your fleet -- tried to go after 88, through the little planet, and then weirdly routes through your home planet?
2010-11-27T20:11:35  <burny> probably it's trying to setup to attack the 60 near base
2010-11-27T20:11:56  <burny> but then by time it has enough there, the 88 is safe to take
2010-11-27T20:13:05  <burny> I'm surprised at how well it ended the game..
2010-11-27T20:13:23  <burny> cause I don't have any logic in place, for gathering troops at the front line, or attacking from multiple planets
2010-11-27T20:15:29  <burny> I guess it did well for the most part.. just it over-considered taking the 60cost 2grow planet
2010-11-27T20:15:29  <virdo> I don't have any "proper" logic for that too... I just spam my fleet away, and if it can go through some neighbouring planet, it does... attacking from multiple planets I have, but not synchronized / no assurances, just fleet spam :)
2010-11-27T20:15:58  <virdo> so often I can send fleet at a neutral and not take it over :(
2010-11-27T20:16:26  <burny> ya, that's what I had before
2010-11-27T20:16:40  <burny> I decided to try and add some anti-snipe logic

2010-11-27T21:47:22  <janzert> timeout is 'T' I'm pretty sure
2010-11-27T21:48:15  <Zannick> if you look at your player page on the server it should have a key

2010-11-27T21:52:15  <Error323> wtffffffff
2010-11-27T21:52:15  <Zannick> i have no idea what that is
2010-11-27T21:52:23  <Terr__> Also things like:
2010-11-27T21:52:24  <Terr__>    Turn  10: 28 7 1        OIOIOIOIOI     Turn  15: 24 1 1             Turn  15: 29 1 11             Turn  15: 28 1 25
2010-11-27T21:52:33  <Error323> antimatroid1: whats ur rank currently?
2010-11-27T21:52:34  <Terr__> er, newlines got bashed there, but it's saying OIOIOIOI for some reason
2010-11-27T21:53:16  <Terr__> I've got some client-side checks for invalid orders, so I'm just confused.
2010-11-27T21:53:27  <antimatroid1> Error323: just above 200, it just lost a game before
2010-11-27T21:53:33  <antimatroid1> it had to climb right from the bottom though
2010-11-27T21:53:40  <Zannick> if it's always "OI" and not just "O" or "I" then i'd presume it means "order invalid"
2010-11-27T21:53:55  <antimatroid1> i'm still tweaking and plan to make one final submission yet though
2010-11-27T21:54:06  <Terr__> My client debug says it is sending 9 orders
2010-11-27T21:54:09  <Terr__> and 9 orders come out...
2010-11-27T21:54:18  <Terr__> With leftover on the planet,mind you
2010-11-27T21:55:04  <Terr__> Correction, no leftover on the planet by design, that 5 is later growth
2010-11-27T21:55:13  <Terr__> Anyway, I'm not sure what the message is here.
2010-11-27T21:55:42  <janzert> Terr__: take a look at your player page on the tcp server to verify if you are losing games by invalid orders or such
2010-11-27T21:56:31  <j3camero> Hey Janzert. I see the servers are not on fire. This is a good thing.

2010-11-27T21:57:50  <Terr__> janzert: Does the TCP server give you some "freebie" timouts/invalid orders and then kills your bot later?
2010-11-27T21:58:11  <janzert> Terr__: not that I know of, but I really don't have any experience with it
2010-11-27T21:58:36  <antimatroid1> pretty sure it doesn't have anything like that
2010-11-27T21:59:03  <antimatroid1> Terr__: in your make move function, are you checking source != dest, and ships > 0?
2010-11-27T21:59:05  <Terr__> Maybe it's just some bizarro interleaved-stdout stuff.

2010-11-27T23:42:50  <antimatroid1> i terribly had a new idea for my tree which seems to be better
2010-11-27T23:42:56  <antimatroid1> so i'm frantically testing it
2010-11-27T23:43:20  <burny> my bot is now way better, except one crucial factor.. it needs to re-enforce the front lines properly
2010-11-27T23:43:38  <burny> before, it would just try to attack the enemy, and stop by the front lines on it's way
2010-11-27T23:43:54  <burny> but I fixed it so it doesn't try to attack so retardly anymore
2010-11-27T23:44:37  <antimatroid1> redistribution is easy if you ahve "closest enemies" calculated
2010-11-27T23:45:02  <antimatroid1> then send like max 3*planets growth to closest planet thats closer to the enemy
2010-11-27T23:45:13  <antimatroid1> or i minimise the distance from source to redist to dest
2010-11-27T23:45:43  <burny> ya, it's easy to get the ships to there..
2010-11-27T23:45:51  <burny> it's trying to figure out which ships to send, and how many
2010-11-27T23:46:06  <antimatroid1> ^^ i  just use the hack of up to 3* that planets growth
2010-11-27T23:46:13  <burny> I don't want it to be making all attacks on neutrals, from whatever planet is closest to enemy
2010-11-27T23:46:19  <antimatroid1> that way it feeds down to nothing (excepting planets sending more in)

2010-11-27T23:50:00  <burny> think I mighta figured out atleast a half-assed way

2010-11-27T23:52:40  * janzert wonders if anyone put in behavior changes for there bot that kick in only once the finals start
2010-11-27T23:53:07  <janzert> I don't think there is really any good reason to do it but also wouldn't be surprised if someone has done it
2010-11-27T23:53:07  <burny> doubt it
2010-11-27T23:53:20  <burny> easier to just commit a new bot at deadline
2010-11-27T23:54:38  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i think i'm going to take a huge gamble and upload this other one

2010-11-27T23:55:14  <antimatroid1> it's basically just doing each layer, picking the best path, and expanding on that
2010-11-27T23:55:24  <antimatroid1> rather than doing all layers then picking the best path
2010-11-27T23:57:22  <davidjliu> urg. my bot confuses me
2010-11-27T23:57:41  <Ken69267> heh
2010-11-27T23:57:53  <wh1teside_> my bot simulates two ply...
2010-11-27T23:57:56  <wh1teside_> ...toilet paper.

2010-11-27T23:58:13  <rebelxt_> haha
2010-11-27T23:58:19  <wh1teside_> the resemblance is uncanny
2010-11-27T23:59:08  <janzert> This is your 1 hour warning
2010-11-27T23:59:10  <janzert> :)
2010-11-27T23:59:10  <rebelxt_> last minute scoring function tweaks can't be bad, right? ;-)
2010-11-27T23:59:21  <phreeza_> hehe
2010-11-27T23:59:33  <phreeza_> rebelxt_: thats what i'm doing, blindly
2010-11-27T23:59:54  <phreeza_> i'm ranking so low, it can't really get worse
