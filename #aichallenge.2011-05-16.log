2011-05-16T00:39:26  <McLeopold> janzert: when using secure jails, I'm not getting output from the bots
2011-05-16T00:40:16  <janzert> not sure what could cause that
2011-05-16T00:40:33  <McLeopold> I'm running with full logging
2011-05-16T00:40:34  <janzert> so play_one_game times out all the bots on the first move?
2011-05-16T00:40:53  <McLeopold> Well, I think it's only from within the worker...
2011-05-16T00:41:06  <McLeopold> I need to compare options then...
2011-05-16T00:41:38  <McLeopold> within the worker for a functional test, both timeout
2011-05-16T00:42:32  <janzert> I guess I'd start by checking if play_one_game works
2011-05-16T00:42:37  <McLeopold> playgame is find
2011-05-16T00:47:00  <McLeopold> wait, no, playgame does a timeout as well
2011-05-16T00:48:04  <McLeopold> janzert: have you gotten a bot to reply to input inside of a jail?
2011-05-16T00:50:33  <McLeopold> janzert: this is my current guess -- shlex.split(shell_command.replace('\\','/'))
2011-05-16T00:56:31  <janzert> yes, play_one_game works fine with secure jails here
2011-05-16T00:56:48  <amstan> McLeopold: works for hypertriangle too

2011-05-16T00:58:30  <McLeopold> It seems like the last 2 shouldn't be split?
2011-05-16T00:59:09  <janzert> why not?
2011-05-16T00:59:28  <McLeopold> It's a guess
2011-05-16T00:59:34  <janzert> they are the program to run and the argument to give it
2011-05-16T00:59:55  <McLeopold> if that's how schroot works, the good
2011-05-16T00:59:58  <janzert> btw, the shlex.split happens even when not run in a secure jail
2011-05-16T01:01:08  <janzert> and taking a look at the schroot man page again, it seems like that should be correct
2011-05-16T01:02:38  <McLeopold> okay, let me try on hypertriangle

2011-05-16T01:18:29  <McLeopold> it's your machine, just want to be sure
2011-05-16T01:18:50  <amstan> np, you can do it
2011-05-16T01:18:56  <amstan> i don't have the stuff open now
2011-05-16T01:21:01  <janzert> why the changes to sandbox.py, they don't seem to make any functional change?
2011-05-16T01:22:16  <McLeopold> So I can pass a --debug switch to worker.py, and a --secure_jail switch to playgame.py
2011-05-16T01:22:47  <janzert> how do the changes in sandbox.py effect that?
2011-05-16T01:23:19  <janzert> ahh, nevermind I figured it out :P
2011-05-16T01:23:30  <janzert> so you can pass in an explicit None and get the default
2011-05-16T01:23:51  <McLeopold> yeah, otherwise the server_info setting takes over

2011-05-16T01:44:42  <Frontier> the engine works again for me, yay! I had trouble with it trying to writing to /srv/chroot
2011-05-16T01:45:16  <McLeopold> janzert: any status on an answer to the working dir question?
2011-05-16T01:46:26  <McLeopold> It seems like it is /home/jailuser?
2011-05-16T01:46:31  <McLeopold> without a number?
2011-05-16T01:46:39  <janzert> that's what it appears to the sandboxed program yes
2011-05-16T01:47:10  <McLeopold> so, what's really going on?
2011-05-16T01:48:06  <janzert> on the outside it is /srv/chroot/jailuser<number>/root/home/jailuser, which is a unionfs and any data written will actually be at /srv/chroot/jailuser<number>/scratch/...
2011-05-16T01:48:39  <janzert> it's a chroot so the /srv/chroot/jailuser<number>/root appears to be the root of the filesystem to the programs inside it
2011-05-16T01:49:18  <McLeopold> Where does the command run at then?  I'm getting a 'cant find MyBot.py'
2011-05-16T01:49:39  <janzert> in /home/jailuser
2011-05-16T01:49:49  <McLeopold> I have a submission_test dir in there
2011-05-16T01:50:03  <McLeopold> so, it's not in the correct location to run the MyBot.py
2011-05-16T01:50:05  <janzert> the sandbox copies the working directory you give for the bot to that spot
2011-05-16T01:50:30  <McLeopold> shouldn't it copy the contents of the dir instead?
2011-05-16T01:50:41  <janzert> that's what I mean
2011-05-16T01:50:52  <McLeopold> so, that's a bug then
2011-05-16T01:51:08  <janzert> it's working here though
2011-05-16T01:51:11  <McLeopold> but it doesn't make sense that you guys see things working
2011-05-16T01:51:41  <janzert> see the Jail.prepare_with method
2011-05-16T01:51:42  <McLeopold> Unless the worker is getting the wrong dir maybe
2011-05-16T01:52:13  <McLeopold> does an ending slash matter?
2011-05-16T01:52:34  <janzert> does it to "cp -r"?
2011-05-16T01:53:33  <janzert> it is using cp -r <working directory given> <jail home directory> to make the copy
2011-05-16T01:53:37  <Frontier> hmm things like that may depend on the distribution
2011-05-16T01:55:15  <McLeopold> janzert: playgame passes a '.' for the working dir, worker does something different
2011-05-16T01:56:20  <janzert> playgame changes to the bot directory before calling the sandbox?
2011-05-16T01:56:37  <McLeopold> no, it just assumes where you run it is your working dir
2011-05-16T01:57:12  <janzert> but that isn't the bot's working directory so should never work
2011-05-16T01:57:29  <McLeopold> so, if I fix it, jails will break for you then :)
2011-05-16T01:58:35  <janzert> to be sure, I'm talking about what ends up as the bot_cwd variable at line 40 of engine.py
2011-05-16T01:58:54  <janzert> and is the first argument to the Sandbox constructor
2011-05-16T01:59:03  <Frontier> McLeopold: Did you add the "status" array to the replays and if so, does it use the same values as the "playerstatus" field described in the wiki?
2011-05-16T01:59:38  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, playgame hardcodes to '.', which I am fixing
2011-05-16T02:00:03  <McLeopold> and when I do, I think you'll see the issue I get with worker, where the dir name is copied to the jailuser
2011-05-16T02:00:07  <McLeopold> not the contents
2011-05-16T02:00:13  <McLeopold> Frontier: I'll check later tonight
2011-05-16T02:01:35  <janzert> @#$^%!@#$%, stupid print functions
2011-05-16T02:01:36  <contestbot> janzert: User error -- Replace user.
2011-05-16T02:01:50  <janzert> python 2 has a print statement for crying out loud
2011-05-16T02:03:03  <McLeopold> it also has future imports
2011-05-16T02:05:26  * janzert isn't going to discuss print functions because all I'm going to do is start screaming
2011-05-16T02:06:03  <janzert> I do see playgame is using the "." so that means the whole ants/ directory structure is getting copied into the sandbox
2011-05-16T02:06:35  <McLeopold> janzert: so, you prefer the print statement over the print function?
2011-05-16T02:06:50  <janzert> I prefer to stick with standard python 2 style
2011-05-16T02:07:06  <janzert> if I was writing python 3 then I'd prefer print functions
2011-05-16T02:07:14  <McLeopold> Noted.  I was preparing for 3
2011-05-16T02:09:41  <janzert> so the working directory passed into the sandbox should be the directory you want the commands run from
2011-05-16T02:09:59  <janzert> and the commands run should assume they are run from that directory obviously :)
2011-05-16T02:10:20  <McLeopold> yes, but I think if I actually did that, it would be broken
2011-05-16T02:10:22  <janzert> the current playgame follows both those rules but in a rather wierd way :P
2011-05-16T02:11:24  <janzert> basically it looks like instead of setting up the commands to run from the bots directory it sets them up to run from the current directory
2011-05-16T02:12:11  <janzert> since the working directory is given as '.' and the bot command is "python dist/sample_bits/python/LeftyBot.py" for example
2011-05-16T02:12:25  <McLeopold> with playgame, someone should be able to pass in a command, which could be "python my/dir/struct/MyBot.py"
2011-05-16T02:12:38  <McLeopold> so, the command has the dir info inside of it
2011-05-16T02:12:59  <McLeopold> okay, we are saying the same thing :)
2011-05-16T02:13:41  <janzert> so long as the sandboxes are running non-secure or the my/dir/struct/ is under the current working directory that will work fine
2011-05-16T02:13:46  <McLeopold> we can make playgame take 2 params for each bot, or we can try and parse it out properly
2011-05-16T02:14:04  <janzert> I would just leave it the way it is
2011-05-16T02:14:04  <McLeopold> worker is a whole different story
2011-05-16T02:14:37  <janzert> it will work fine for people using it themselves since they won't be running in secure mode anyway
2011-05-16T02:15:20  <McLeopold> but, worker passes ("../ants/submission_test/", "python TestBot.py"), and the jail has a "submission_test" dir.  Shouldn't the contents be copied?
2011-05-16T02:16:08  <janzert> what does "cp -r ../ants/submission_test/ some_test_destination" do?
2011-05-16T02:16:37  <McLeopold> not the contents
2011-05-16T02:16:47  <McLeopold> you need a splat on the end
2011-05-16T02:16:49  <janzert> also using a relative path like that is going to cause the behaviour to be dependent on the scripts current working directory
2011-05-16T02:17:14  <janzert> don't use * cause you won't get any .dot files
2011-05-16T02:17:18  <McLeopold> I think I mentioned making these module dir to solve that
2011-05-16T02:17:59  <janzert> I would recommend getting an absolute directory to pass to the sandbox

2011-05-16T03:08:17  <McLeopold> the worker is passing the correct commands defined here: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py#L227
2011-05-16T03:08:34  <McLeopold> janzert: look at the code, it should work
2011-05-16T03:08:44  <janzert> and "../mylanguage/interpreter ../mybot/MyBot.mylanguage"? :)
2011-05-16T03:08:58  <McLeopold> janzert: that last one may fail :)
2011-05-16T03:09:14  <janzert> I guess I'm saying I think an option argument might be better way to go
2011-05-16T03:09:33  <janzert> although actually there probably isn't a way to make the latter one work sanely
2011-05-16T03:10:06  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes
2011-05-16T03:10:41  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if you have a lone scout ant, and it dies, it gets to see who it killed
2011-05-16T03:11:27  <McLeopold> antimatroid: ants move -> vision calc -> battle -> birth
2011-05-16T03:12:03  <McLeopold> antimatroid: although, I'm thinking of this as well: birth -> move -> vision -> battle
2011-05-16T03:12:40  <McLeopold> that last one prevents the boost from spawning an ant, slightly harder to spawn under contention
2011-05-16T03:14:18  <janzert> bah, on my development VM sandbox.py command line works, on my server test vm it doesn't
2011-05-16T03:15:36  <janzert> and play_one_game, even with the latest playgame.py, works fine on both
2011-05-16T03:15:59  <McLeopold> hypertriangle worker works now!
2011-05-16T03:17:49  <janzert> the box where it's not working, does "./sandbox.py -o echo test" give you a "response: test" line?
2011-05-16T03:17:51  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: do you mean move->birth?
2011-05-16T03:18:00  <janzert> and how about without the -o argument
2011-05-16T03:18:50  <antimatroid1> you will get more draws for food doing that?
2011-05-16T03:19:04  <McLeopold> janzert: No more responses. Terminating.
2011-05-16T03:19:13  <McLeopold> so, no
2011-05-16T03:19:35  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I was specifying the order in which things are calculated in the engine
2011-05-16T03:19:50  <janzert> heh, so even where it's not working correctly for me I still get that response
2011-05-16T03:20:17  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it means you have to be next to food *before* your ant moves, so you have to wait a turn
2011-05-16T03:20:40  <McLeopold> janzert: I guess your not in jail?  Get out of jail free card? :p
2011-05-16T03:24:19  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I don't get the difference
2011-05-16T03:24:26  <antimatroid1> except your ant spawns after the change of turn
2011-05-16T03:24:44  <McLeopold> which you can't then control right away
2011-05-16T03:25:16  <antimatroid1> yeah okay, i think that's more confusing than anything :P
2011-05-16T03:25:28  <McLeopold> it is...
2011-05-16T03:25:34  <antimatroid1> and it could still spawn then too
2011-05-16T03:25:37  <antimatroid1> the new ant that is
2011-05-16T03:25:57  <McLeopold> I just don't like the boost in speed you get from walking towards food
2011-05-16T03:26:03  <antimatroid1> why not?
2011-05-16T03:26:11  <McLeopold> I guess it can be a technique for faster growth
2011-05-16T03:26:27  <antimatroid1> everyone gets the same deal
2011-05-16T03:26:51  <McLeopold> because, if 2 players are distance 20 from the same spot, random food shouldn't give either an advantage in speed
2011-05-16T03:28:18  <antimatroid1> ... symmetric food spawning == win
2011-05-16T03:28:25  <antimatroid1> it's too hard to make things fair asymmetrically
2011-05-16T03:28:30  <McLeopold> Frontier: is there anyway to speed up the replays?
2011-05-16T03:28:54  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: it's a nitpick, so it's not worth messing with

2011-05-16T03:34:11  <Frontier> lol, we can add a constructor field to override settings of course. and we should do that really to avoid having people with fullscreen mode as default not seeing the front page

2011-05-16T03:35:43  <McLeopold> looks like it's trying to load an apache dir listing...
2011-05-16T03:36:00  <McLeopold> janzert: that wasn't me

2011-05-16T03:38:30  <McLeopold> yeah, I read the page and then thought, crap, I've seen this before :p
2011-05-16T03:38:37  <McLeopold> Frontier: memcache issue...
2011-05-16T03:39:15  <Frontier> oh how does that happen? i mean how can "games/0/0.replay" become "games/" ?

2011-05-16T03:39:58  <McLeopold> thx to the magic of mod_rewrite
2011-05-16T03:42:42  <Frontier> McLeopold: currently I set the playback speed as 1 turn / second, but keep the playback time at max 1 minute. That means any game longer than 60 turns gets sped up. That doesn't work too well with a simple +/-. So I wonder if I should drop the automagic speed correction or make it configurable.

2011-05-16T03:43:31  <McLeopold> It's some fairly simple math to set it either way.  I like that idea
2011-05-16T03:44:04  <janzert> can't +/- buttons change based on a percentage?
2011-05-16T03:44:22  <McLeopold> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/  looking kinda good
2011-05-16T03:44:22  <janzert> say 25% faster or slower each time they're pressed
2011-05-16T03:44:23  <Frontier> ?
2011-05-16T03:45:15  <Frontier> janzert: sure, the point is I have a time limit in place: no replay runs longer than a minute no matter what the speed setting is.

2011-05-16T03:46:15  <Frontier> who would want to watch a 900 turns game at 1 or 2 turns a second? that would take 7:30 to watch
2011-05-16T03:46:30  <McLeopold> well, for a starting speed, sure, but you want to be able to slow it down when reviewing a match
2011-05-16T03:46:47  <janzert> I certainly would when wanting to check out a specific part of the battle
2011-05-16T03:47:11  <Frontier> ... which makes it difficult again to save that setting, because it depends on the actual replay length :p

2011-05-16T03:48:16  <McLeopold> but at least give the controls
2011-05-16T03:48:20  <janzert> can't you set a moves to play per second variable when first loading based on the replay length then just modify that variable faster or slower when requested by the buttons?
2011-05-16T03:49:05  <janzert> you could even save it as a default speed as well if you want to provide a quick way for them to get back to a reasonable speed
2011-05-16T03:49:05  <Frontier> yeah sure, so no saving of the speed setting.

2011-05-16T03:53:29  <McLeopold> janzert: that's a bug in the ants.py engine

2011-05-16T04:05:46  <Frontier> I mean... strip the ui as an option
2011-05-16T04:06:06  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: oh, didn't realise that :P

2011-05-16T04:46:09  <Frontier> yesterday, a satire show asked someone in the pedestian prescinct to give them all their bank account information so they can look for that on the internet and remove it. the person was so aware of securing personal data that she agreed.

2011-05-16T09:36:41  <antimatroid1> :P
2011-05-16T09:36:45  <antimatroid1> are you using it normally?
2011-05-16T09:36:55  <antimatroid1> or are you using a different language?
2011-05-16T09:37:10  <Ice_Harley> i use C#
2011-05-16T09:38:04  <Ice_Harley> i forgot averything about C++ years ago :) Maybe problems because of using windows?
2011-05-16T09:39:52  <antimatroid1> it used to work on windows for me no problems
2011-05-16T09:40:14  <Ice_Harley> no timeval type in windows time.h
2011-05-16T09:40:44  <antimatroid1> :\ i have used that exact timer in windows before
2011-05-16T09:40:55  <antimatroid1> it's the same one i used for tron and pw
2011-05-16T09:40:58  <antimatroid1> except a bit cleaner
2011-05-16T09:41:28  <antimatroid1> but yeah, it's not good if it only works for some compilers/whatever
2011-05-16T09:42:06  <Ice_Harley> i found that #include <winsock2.h> needed

2011-05-16T09:44:50  <Frontier> I bet winsock2.h includes some basic header file like type.h or windows.h that is needed.
2011-05-16T09:45:35  <antimatroid1> Ice_Harley: can you try windows.h or type.h?
2011-05-16T09:45:43  <antimatroid1> i can make it catch that on windows computers
2011-05-16T09:46:09  <Frontier> That was a VERY wild guess, I'm not using Windows or C much

2011-05-16T09:49:09  <Ice_Harley> new problem now: gettimeofday not found
2011-05-16T09:55:45  <Ice_Harley> seems gettimeofday it unix only function. And windows people should use something like GetSystemTime
2011-05-16T09:57:04  <antimatroid1> i assure you i have previously used it on windows
2011-05-16T09:57:12  <antimatroid1> but it could be the compiler
2011-05-16T09:57:20  <antimatroid1> i am not overly knowledgeable on these things
2011-05-16T09:57:47  <jbroman> Worst-case, you can conditionally implement it using the Windows API.
2011-05-16T09:57:58  <antimatroid1> i don't want it to be that messy :(
2011-05-16T09:58:07  <antimatroid1> i want beginners to be able to go through it and learn the language better
2011-05-16T09:58:23  <jbroman> Hahaha, portable C is a lie.
2011-05-16T09:59:08  <jbroman> (That's overly broad, but I like to pretend Windows does not exist for this reason.)
2011-05-16T10:00:47  <antimatroid1> i have stopped caring about windows :P
2011-05-16T10:00:51  <antimatroid1> but i kind of have to here
2011-05-16T10:03:57  <Frontier> i have to know how to configure apache2 now. Since I don't use it solely for ants and don't generally mess up the config, I cannot use the build script to configure it, but there are now mod_rewrite rules required to load replays.
2011-05-16T10:05:36  <smiley1983> Portable C has one set of functions for Windows, and one set of functions for all the POSIX systems. (maybe a bit general, but represents what I've seen)
2011-05-16T10:07:36  <antimatroid1> i would have been using mingw on windows
2011-05-16T10:09:57  <janzert> Frontier: if using ubuntu or something that uses the same apache configuration directory setup you should still be able to drop an appropriately filled out apache_site.template in the setup directory into your apache sites-available directory and an appropriate link to it from sites-enabled
2011-05-16T10:10:13  <janzert> both located in /etc/apache2 on ubuntu
2011-05-16T10:11:07  <janzert> that'll set it up as a virtualhost
2011-05-16T10:11:16  <Frontier> yeah, as I said, I need to learn the apache configuration stuff now. I try to only add some appropriate rewrite rules
2011-05-16T10:11:49  <Frontier> I don't even know what a virtualhost is
2011-05-16T10:12:52  <janzert> :) it's the most common way to host multiple domains off one server basically
2011-05-16T10:16:15  <Frontier> janzert: was it your idea then to use mod_rewrite instead of a php function?
2011-05-16T10:16:29  <janzert> nope
2011-05-16T10:17:14  <janzert> from what I can tell the mod_rewrite isn't really needed it just is being used to cleanup the game replay urls a bit
2011-05-16T10:18:20  <antimatroid1> Ice_Harley: do you think they all realise the edges are wrapped?
2011-05-16T10:18:25  <antimatroid1> i've had a read through of the thread
2011-05-16T10:19:22  <Ice_Harley> i think yes. But if not, they will realise it very quickly.
2011-05-16T10:21:20  <antimatroid1> is symmetric food spawning default yet?
2011-05-16T10:21:28  <Ice_Harley> why are you asking? What message made you think so?
2011-05-16T10:21:39  <antimatroid1> just had a read through
2011-05-16T10:21:45  <antimatroid1> didn't see that mentioned anywhere
2011-05-16T10:23:12  <Frontier> janzert: I found the problem: I didn't realize there were double {{ and }} in the template file that when I copied the rules. Those become single brackets once the variables are replaced.

2011-05-16T10:29:17  <antimatroid1> well crap, i can't find anything promising for using gettimeofday generally on windows :(
2011-05-16T10:29:21  <antimatroid1> bloody windows, why must it exist
2011-05-16T10:30:29  <janzert> Frontier: ahh
2011-05-16T10:32:08  <Frontier> antimatroid1: on windows you use QueryPerformanceTimer, which uses a hardware timer
2011-05-16T10:32:20  <smiley1983> I'm having trouble running matches with non-Python bots with the current contest code. I run play_one_game.sh and it runs. I make a copy, it runs. I modify the copy so one of the bots points to the Python starter, it runs. I modify the same bot so it points to a compiled binary starter (cpp or ocaml) and it crashes with "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory"
2011-05-16T10:32:37  <Frontier> you get the frequency of the hardware by calling QueryPerformanceFrequency
2011-05-16T10:33:31  <antimatroid1> Frontier: it would be nice if it was the same thing across os's :P
2011-05-16T10:33:36  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, engine use walltime
2011-05-16T10:34:07  <smiley1983> Also, if I modify it to run "ocamlrun /path/to/bytecode" that fails as well, so it seems to only like python bots atm.
2011-05-16T10:34:12  <antimatroid1> i could just let people deal with the timer themselves
2011-05-16T10:37:31  <janzert> smiley1983: and running the same bot command in the same directory as playgame is run from the bot works?
2011-05-16T10:38:22  <smiley1983> Yes
2011-05-16T10:38:23  <Frontier> Ice_Harley: QueryPerformanceCounter is wall time, not cpu time. You just have to do "counter / frequency" to get a value in seconds
2011-05-16T10:39:20  <smiley1983> janzert: When I type dist/starter_bots/cpp/MyBot from the ants directory, the program runs
2011-05-16T10:39:50  <janzert> if that works and it doesn't with the engine I'm not sure what might be going on
2011-05-16T10:40:11  <smiley1983> I can't seem to see the error output from playgame.pt

2011-05-16T10:41:20  <janzert> Mcleopold has done a lot of logging and error handling refactoring lately I really don't know how things are working now
2011-05-16T10:42:19  <smiley1983> Ah, it's only outputting that info if it gets the wrong number of bots, perhaps I can get it by passing too few
2011-05-16T10:43:29  <smiley1983> Hm, it hasn't introduced any errors in its path processing (which is what I had been expecting).
2011-05-16T10:43:52  <smiley1983> It would be nice if Python would tell you *which* file doesn't exist
2011-05-16T10:44:38  <janzert> it should be at least showing a traceback that allows you to find exactly where the call is being made

2011-05-16T15:40:07  <McLeopold> how so?
2011-05-16T15:41:22  <amstan> morgages mostly, since there won't be any purpose to store your money in banks(besides interest), so banks won't have money to loan
2011-05-16T15:42:57  <a1k0n> i was just pointing out today that bitcoins are almost worth $8 on mtgox, which implies a market capitalization of over $46 million
2011-05-16T15:43:50  <a1k0n> that is... totally insane for an experimental open source thing
2011-05-16T15:48:08  <amstan> a1k0n: lol
2011-05-16T15:48:11  <amstan> yeah, fun
2011-05-16T15:49:44  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2011-05-16T15:51:24  <a1k0n> btw if you can do fractional reserve banking with cash you can do it with bitcoin.  you just don't have a federal reserve to print more money for you if your clients want their money back
2011-05-16T15:52:35  <a1k0n> but someone with substantial bitcoin holdings could lend out guaranteed money
2011-05-16T16:01:09  <delt0r_> a1k0n: if there is a cap on the total --fractional reserve does not work.
2011-05-16T16:01:15  <delt0r_> bitcoin has a cap
2011-05-16T16:01:35  <a1k0n> ah, that is true
2011-05-16T16:01:45  <a1k0n> i forgot about that
2011-05-16T16:02:33  <a1k0n> it isn't a technological limitation, more of a protocol
2011-05-16T16:02:54  <delt0r_> well in the Austrian school of Economics --the whole boom/bust cycle is caused by fractional banking and the "perpetual" increase of currency
2011-05-16T16:03:06  <a1k0n> right, so the gold standard is supposedly a good thing to emulate
2011-05-16T16:03:09  <delt0r_> as the theory goes
2011-05-16T16:03:30  <a1k0n> one could create an alternate bitcoin market, exactly the same way, without the cap.  and so far in bitcoin's history none of the capping mechanisms have come into play
2011-05-16T16:03:48  <delt0r_> well the gold standard has a lot in common with modern currency... bascially that golds worth is far above its utility
2011-05-16T16:04:12  <delt0r_> so it can still crash... but yea--you have a natural cap on suply
2011-05-16T16:04:56  <delt0r_> a1k0n: true... but "hash cash" has problems of over supply with increasing cpu power
2011-05-16T16:05:06  <delt0r_> it can't stay scarce
2011-05-16T16:05:28  <a1k0n> well, that's why there's a protocol on which everyone agrees to self-adjust difficulty to mint coins once every ten minutes
2011-05-16T16:05:40  <a1k0n> which is also a natural cap to make growth linear instead of exponential i guess
2011-05-16T16:05:52  <a1k0n> an asymptotic cap on log-money
2011-05-16T16:06:26  <delt0r_> yea---tbh i remain unconvinced its a improvement over a central clearing house
2011-05-16T16:06:38  <delt0r_> in the bitcoin case at least
2011-05-16T16:07:09  <delt0r_> I don't like how transaction are validated ---localized fraud can still occur
2011-05-16T16:07:19  <a1k0n> we'll see i guess.  it's a great experiment
2011-05-16T16:07:28  <a1k0n> how so?
2011-05-16T16:07:39  <delt0r_> for example here in Vienna a bunch of fake 10EU notes are going around
2011-05-16T16:07:42  <a1k0n> they're validated by appearing in a new block right?
2011-05-16T16:08:33  <delt0r_> but when i trade. its not validated immediately. You have to wait till you have all the information
2011-05-16T16:08:46  <a1k0n> right
2011-05-16T16:09:27  <delt0r_> Like the fake 10EU notes... you detect the fraud... later and are out of pocket to the tune of 10EU
2011-05-16T16:09:43  <delt0r_> These are really good fakes btw
2011-05-16T16:09:57  <delt0r_> only the UV missing and the metal strip
2011-05-16T16:10:02  <delt0r_> even has the water marks
2011-05-16T16:10:20  <a1k0n> so you're saying in a point-of-sale type situation where you can just "beam" a bitcoin transaction to someone and walk away, it's trivial to just fake it
2011-05-16T16:10:41  <delt0r_> yea--not quite trivial
2011-05-16T16:10:43  <a1k0n> that is true; nothign is certain until a vlidation comes through
2011-05-16T16:10:48  <delt0r_> but not really hard either
2011-05-16T16:10:54  <a1k0n> yeah they have to have a fake block in reserve
2011-05-16T16:10:59  <delt0r_> yep
2011-05-16T16:11:12  <delt0r_> so you still need to generate the "hashcash"
2011-05-16T16:11:15  <a1k0n> which means... they could just "redeem" it as a regular bitcoin for currently $375 USD
2011-05-16T16:11:15  <delt0r_> lol
2011-05-16T16:11:33  <a1k0n> so.. that kind of fraud wouldn't be worth it.  shrug.
2011-05-16T16:11:34  <delt0r_> its gone up that much?
2011-05-16T16:11:36  <a1k0n> anyway.  lunch.
2011-05-16T16:11:41  <delt0r_> l8r
2011-05-16T16:11:42  <a1k0n> yes, it's trading for $7.50 on mtgox
2011-05-16T16:11:43  <a1k0n> it's insane
2011-05-16T16:11:57  <delt0r_> it was 2 last i looked
