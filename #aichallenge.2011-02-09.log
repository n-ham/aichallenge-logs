2011-02-09T00:00:46  <amstan> nullkuhl: nope
2011-02-09T00:00:57  <amstan> nullkuhl: there's just code everywhere
2011-02-09T00:01:02  <amstan> hard to tell
2011-02-09T00:01:08  <amstan> we got some specs done for ants
2011-02-09T00:01:13  <amstan> but.. we're still far
2011-02-09T00:01:40  <nullkuhl> its all managed by waterloo university ?
2011-02-09T00:02:34  <amstan> no
2011-02-09T00:02:45  <amstan> some of us are students from there
2011-02-09T00:02:50  <amstan> but... no affiliation anymore
2011-02-09T00:06:16  <antimatroid> amstan: some requests for the new site, leaderboards for organisations and countries, and those graphs on users profiles  showing ranking vs time
2011-02-09T00:06:24  <antimatroid> so, what tron had
2011-02-09T00:06:51  <amstan> antimatroid: the site redesign is for zeta
2011-02-09T00:06:56  <nullkuhl> amstan: i was wondering if i could contribute by anything, i do web dev, and graphic design.
2011-02-09T00:06:57  <antimatroid> oh okay
2011-02-09T00:06:57  <amstan> for the other one.. idk
2011-02-09T00:07:07  <antimatroid> i just had an idea for ranking countries/organisations
2011-02-09T00:07:11  <amstan> nullkuhl: we could use some design ideas for the website
2011-02-09T00:07:19  <antimatroid> run a separate set of rankings, and assume a player from each just plays for them
2011-02-09T00:07:36  <antimatroid> and count up accordingly, does that work when you might have the "same player" playing
2011-02-09T00:08:01  <nullkuhl> amstan: sure, what are the requirements ?
2011-02-09T00:08:30  <amstan> nullkuhl: it just needs to look professional, that's pretty much it
2011-02-09T00:08:37  <amstan> but more than that.. there's no limits

2011-02-09T00:10:47  <amstan> theme... we're doing ants next, so we could do a disposable design just for ants
2011-02-09T00:10:55  <amstan> there's no preferred colours
2011-02-09T00:14:10  <nullkuhl> amstan: i was just wondering about that yesterday, about "ants", i mean the idea got morphed now and includes some sort of infections, so are there any thoughts to change "ants" to "zombies" or something like that ?
2011-02-09T00:14:34  <amstan> we had a vote, we're staying with ants
2011-02-09T00:15:59  <nullkuhl> oh okay
2011-02-09T00:16:42  <nullkuhl> ill start doing some prototype for the website design then, if am done with anything where should i be submitting it ? i mean are there other ppl working on the design as well submitting to somewhere ?

2011-02-09T00:18:46  <nullkuhl> yeah i know, i was just wondering whom should i wait for a feedback from, anyway ill submit to forum and pm you the thread link
2011-02-09T00:19:27  <amstan> i offered to work on the site as well
2011-02-09T00:19:33  <amstan> we could work on it together
2011-02-09T00:19:46  <amstan> don't worry about the topic, i check the forums regularly for any new posts
2011-02-09T00:19:51  <amstan> no need to pm me
2011-02-09T00:20:06  <amstan> i'll reply with oppinions when you post
2011-02-09T00:22:06  <nullkuhl> ok great
2011-02-09T00:23:03  <amstan> thanks for helping btw
2011-02-09T00:23:42  <Frontier> What is the procedure to add new programming languages?
2011-02-09T00:23:55  <nullkuhl> sure, its not much of a contribution anyway :), i am hoping i could help more later on
2011-02-09T00:24:07  <amstan> Frontier: which framework?
2011-02-09T00:25:15  <Frontier> Framework? D with the phobos library. I think it is marture enough to take a place at the side of C++.
2011-02-09T00:26:27  <amstan> Frontier: there's 2 branches being worked on, see topic
2011-02-09T00:26:59  <Frontier> what branches? which topic?
2011-02-09T00:27:34  <amstan> Frontier: http://www.ai-contest.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=1238
2011-02-09T00:30:32  <Frontier> oh, ok. I know that thread. Adding a programming language to either code base doesn't take long I assume. After all .NET has been mastered :)
2011-02-09T00:30:41  <amstan> yeah
2011-02-09T00:31:05  <amstan> Frontier: either this file: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/planet_wars/backend/compile_anything.py
2011-02-09T00:31:41  <amstan> or this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/zeta/worker/language.py
2011-02-09T00:31:56  <janzert1> Adding D to either or both frameworks should be almost trivial, except for the part of getting it installed on workers
2011-02-09T00:32:14  <janzert1> I don't think the new framework addresses that part at all yet though
2011-02-09T00:32:37  <Frontier> That's a good place to start. Thank you. What else is needed for the installation?
2011-02-09T00:32:51  <Frontier> Just a .deb file?
2011-02-09T00:33:09  <amstan> Frontier: yeah, an easy way to install it
2011-02-09T00:33:24  <amstan> ideally in the ubuntu repo, if not a ppa, if not a deb, if not a source to compile
2011-02-09T00:33:26  <amstan> and so on

2011-02-09T00:41:15  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~scott@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-09T00:42:22  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i had an idea with spawning ants, suppose you are using option 1 for battles,
2011-02-09T00:42:23  <antimatroid> do players moves, resolve births (player with most ants in range wins, if not unique, food dies), then battle resolution?
2011-02-09T00:44:09  <McLeopold> I don't think it makes much difference.  At first I wanted food to be secured before spawning an ant.  Now that we remove food in contention, it doesn't really matter.
2011-02-09T00:44:33  <antimatroid> but this doesn't necessarily remove food in contention
2011-02-09T00:44:38  <antimatroid> only if there's a draw for that contention
2011-02-09T00:45:28  <McLeopold> so, removing food first, before battle, would tend to remove more food from the game
2011-02-09T00:45:53  <antimatroid> i guess maybe
2011-02-09T00:46:34  <antimatroid> i was looking at doing the rule afterwards, but i think you'd need to then resolve battles again
2011-02-09T00:46:38  <McLeopold> I think I would prefer less food being removed
2011-02-09T00:46:47  <antimatroid> yeah i agree with that
2011-02-09T00:46:48  <McLeopold> but I could be convinced otherwise
2011-02-09T00:47:04  <antimatroid> i thought it might make the claiming of new ants more interesting
2011-02-09T00:47:08  <McLeopold> if there was a really compelling reason
2011-02-09T00:47:31  <antimatroid> no major reason, just looking for the most interesting game
2011-02-09T00:47:50  <McLeopold> it's more of a race with who can get the most there first, but if you tie, its gone
2011-02-09T00:48:05  <McLeopold> no one would *not* go for the food
2011-02-09T00:48:38  <antimatroid> you basically want to do that now, but just be the first there
2011-02-09T00:48:47  <antimatroid> if you both get there, nothing strategic about it, it goes
2011-02-09T00:48:56  <McLeopold> what would make it more interesting is if you had to hold on to the advantage for a few turns
2011-02-09T00:49:15  <antimatroid> i think that's getting too complicated
2011-02-09T00:49:23  <antimatroid> atm it's nice and simple
2011-02-09T00:49:29  <antimatroid> while still interesting
2011-02-09T00:56:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: do you have experience with python's Queue
2011-02-09T00:56:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: no
2011-02-09T00:56:44  <antimatroid> i've only ever used python for map gens
2011-02-09T00:56:53  <antimatroid> and i learnt most of it from j3camero's last one
2011-02-09T00:57:01  <McLeopold> ouch
2011-02-09T00:57:12  <McLeopold> dive into python
2011-02-09T00:57:24  <antimatroid> i've been trying (not very hard) to learn haskell

2011-02-09T01:33:44  <Zannick> aye
2011-02-09T01:33:59  <McLeopold> I'm having trouble with sadbox similar stuff
2011-02-09T01:34:07  <McLeopold> I thought that you had worked on it.
2011-02-09T01:34:21  <Zannick> i've hacked away at it a little
2011-02-09T01:34:55  <McLeopold> okay, I've created a process with popen, but, when I write to the process stdin, nothing seems to go
2011-02-09T01:35:02  <McLeopold> I've added a flush, just in case
2011-02-09T01:35:29  <McLeopold> My subprocess is a python script that is writing to a log file all the stuff that come on stdin.
2011-02-09T01:35:36  <McLeopold> It writes a blank file
2011-02-09T01:35:50  <McLeopold> If I run the script from the shell, it works.
2011-02-09T01:35:52  <Zannick> is it flushing its output to the file?
2011-02-09T01:36:05  <McLeopold> if I run directly yes
2011-02-09T01:36:16  <McLeopold> I can add flushes to that side to make sure
2011-02-09T01:36:38  <janzert> python subprocess.Popen?
2011-02-09T01:37:02  <Zannick> so you're using user_sadbox?
2011-02-09T01:37:21  <Zannick> and sadbox.write or sadbox.write_line?
2011-02-09T01:37:29  <McLeopold> hmm, so adding flush to the bot made it write
2011-02-09T01:37:40  <McLeopold> No, I'm using something dmj111 wrote
2011-02-09T01:37:45  <McLeopold> but it is similar
2011-02-09T01:37:51  <McLeopold> same technique
2011-02-09T01:38:02  <Zannick> well, if the flushing output made it write
2011-02-09T01:38:03  <Zannick> well then
2011-02-09T01:38:03  <Frontier> Zannick: You are writing python code for the next contest, right?
2011-02-09T01:38:03  <McLeopold> It looks like my new lines are getting lost
2011-02-09T01:38:10  <Zannick> Frontier: some
2011-02-09T01:38:22  <Zannick> McLeopold: really not sure what you mean
2011-02-09T01:38:46  <McLeopold> my bot didn't record receiving new line characters from the engine.
2011-02-09T01:39:21  <Frontier> If we were to add the D programming language, would we want object files to be generated or just generate the final executable?
2011-02-09T01:39:21  <McLeopold> wait, no, that's not it
2011-02-09T01:39:21  <Zannick> so you sent it a\nb\n and it recorded ab?
2011-02-09T01:39:53  <Zannick> Frontier: the C compiling steps generated object files then link it all together, so that would be fine
2011-02-09T01:40:02  <Zannick> s/generated/generate/
2011-02-09T01:42:17  <janzert> Frontier I would just do dmd -release -O mybot.d <rest of .d files>
2011-02-09T01:42:39  <janzert> if I'm remembering my dmd command line right off the top of my head
2011-02-09T01:43:51  <janzert> I don't think there is any benefit to add a separate per file compilation step in this situation
2011-02-09T01:43:58  <Frontier> maybe with an additional -inline
2011-02-09T01:44:13  <Frontier> What is the benefit in the C/C++ case?
2011-02-09T01:44:17  <janzert> ahh, yeah. that's the one I was forgetting
2011-02-09T01:44:41  <janzert> for whatever reason they're passing different options in the compilation and linking stages
2011-02-09T01:44:51  <janzert> not really sure how that came about or why
2011-02-09T01:44:58  <Frontier> *they* :D
2011-02-09T01:45:13  <janzert> as in someone(s) before my time :)
2011-02-09T01:45:30  <Zannick> i took out the -funroll-loops for zeta :P
2011-02-09T01:45:50  <Frontier> That was a bit esoteric honestly
2011-02-09T01:46:10  * janzert certainly didn't want to take responsibility for it :P
2011-02-09T01:46:58  <Frontier> I'll try and get the backend running locally and create a patch for D

2011-02-09T01:48:17  <McLeopold> so, janzert and I did the map analysis?
2011-02-09T01:48:33  <janzert> hmm, what map analysis was that?
2011-02-09T01:48:42  <McLeopold> average planets
2011-02-09T01:48:51  <McLeopold> average growth per map
2011-02-09T01:49:03  <Zannick> i might have been involved with that, i made a mapgen fix
2011-02-09T01:49:06  <janzert> well at least I was the one asking for those numbers from you anyway :)
2011-02-09T01:49:11  <McLeopold> okay
2011-02-09T01:49:27  <McLeopold> so, my bot is getting input
2011-02-09T01:49:43  <McLeopold> it should be writing to stdout, but something else is crashing...

2011-02-09T01:56:02  <McLeopold> so my hope was to just drop this in and have it work
2011-02-09T01:56:09  <McLeopold> that hasn't happened
2011-02-09T01:56:20  <Zannick> i'm not surprised!
2011-02-09T01:56:25  <McLeopold> So, I just want to run a bot using stdin/stdout with my engine
2011-02-09T01:56:28  <Zannick> no offense to dmj
2011-02-09T01:56:37  <McLeopold> It was a work in progress
2011-02-09T01:57:13  <Zannick> i don't really know what is gained by running the bots separately from separate threads
2011-02-09T01:57:23  <McLeopold> Is there an easy way I can just use the sadbox stuff?
2011-02-09T02:00:07  <Zannick> https://bitbucket.org/zannick/planet-wars/src/36d9e6b7b643/user_sadbox.py
2011-02-09T02:00:30  <McLeopold> is that not in the official repo?
2011-02-09T02:00:33  <Zannick> basically, strip everything related to ssh or jail security and just run it in a subprocess
2011-02-09T02:00:41  <Zannick> no
2011-02-09T02:00:56  <Zannick> that is a version i modified while testing my own bot during planet-wars
2011-02-09T02:02:36  <McLeopold> did we pick a license yet?
2011-02-09T02:03:00  <Zannick> for epsilon? i don't know.
2011-02-09T02:03:21  <Zannick> for zeta i don't know either, but there was a joke about using the wtf license
2011-02-09T02:04:18  <McLeopold> so, you're syed?
2011-02-09T02:04:36  <Zannick> syed?
2011-02-09T02:05:09  <Zannick> oh, no i totally didn't write that file at all
2011-02-09T02:05:19  <Zannick> i just remarked out all the parts that needed to be remarked out
2011-02-09T02:05:45  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-09T02:05:51  <McLeopold> I run with this for awhile
2011-02-09T02:06:01  <Zannick> oh, so
2011-02-09T02:06:13  <Zannick> i think i see the problem in BotThread.run
2011-02-09T02:06:20  <McLeopold> ?
2011-02-09T02:06:31  <Zannick> line = self.process.stdout.readline()
2011-02-09T02:06:39  <Zannick> readline doesn't give a newline, iirc
2011-02-09T02:07:05  <Zannick> and then result.append(line)
2011-02-09T02:07:07  <McLeopold> he was putting them in a list, then doing a '\n'.join later
2011-02-09T02:07:10  <Zannick> and "".join(result)
2011-02-09T02:07:11  <janzert> only looking back at this occasionally, so not sure what the threads above were referring too, but generally it's easiest to do i/o with the bots by using a thread per bot
2011-02-09T02:07:23  <Zannick> no, there isn't a '\n'.join
2011-02-09T02:07:28  <Zannick> it's "".join
2011-02-09T02:08:19  * janzert wanders away again
2011-02-09T02:08:21  <Zannick> the old user_sadbox simply put each line into the output queue itself
2011-02-09T02:08:36  <Zannick> so each line was parsed separately rather than all lines from the turn
2011-02-09T02:09:33  <McLeopold> I think I'd rather learn the sadbox way, if that is what we will use
2011-02-09T02:09:50  <Zannick> for epsilon, we will probably want to use that
2011-02-09T02:10:01  <McLeopold> I remember fcntl giving me issues in windows for some reason
2011-02-09T02:10:04  <Zannick> for zeta, there is something slightly new going on
2011-02-09T02:10:20  <Zannick> i have never been certain how necessary those lines were
2011-02-09T02:10:36  <Zannick> especially as they were used in the non-secure case of the sadbox
2011-02-09T02:10:57  <Zannick> which was the case that wasn't being used
2011-02-09T02:10:59  <janzert> btw, if using the sadbox from the last contest go from the one the workers were using, not the main server backend directory
2011-02-09T02:11:34  <janzert> the engine and sadbox and other stuff for actually playing games in that directory should be thrown away since it bit rotted for about the last month of the contest
2011-02-09T02:12:01  <janzert> all actual game playing had moved to workers at that point
2011-02-09T02:12:35  <McLeopold> I only need enough framework to test the engine and bots
2011-02-09T02:12:58  <McLeopold> I don't even want to try and improve or work on this part.
2011-02-09T02:13:05  <Zannick> you will likely be fine with my version of the user_sadbox
2011-02-09T02:13:11  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-09T02:13:18  <Zannick> it is the barest of wrappers around subprocess.Popen
2011-02-09T02:13:47  <McLeopold> 2 space python, shame on you
2011-02-09T02:13:53  <Zannick> not my fault
2011-02-09T02:14:12  <janzert> yeah, someone previous to the last contest liked 2 space indention :(
2011-02-09T02:14:24  <McLeopold> I'm telling Guido...
2011-02-09T02:14:34  <Zannick> my changes to that file were adding '#' characters to several lines
2011-02-09T02:14:39  <Zannick> and adding a couple print statements
2011-02-09T02:15:48  <McLeopold> do I need the working directory stuff?
2011-02-09T02:16:17  <Zannick> um...no.
2011-02-09T02:16:24  <Zannick> no, wait, yes.
2011-02-09T02:16:38  <Zannick> it should just be the working directory of the bot
2011-02-09T02:16:43  <McLeopold> it's only passed to the popen
2011-02-09T02:16:45  <Zannick> so 'bots/' is fine
2011-02-09T02:16:48  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-09T02:17:08  <Zannick> and the third arg 'security_on' should be False
2011-02-09T02:17:15  <McLeopold> I removed it
2011-02-09T02:17:29  <Zannick> either way :)
2011-02-09T02:17:51  <McLeopold> so, I'm thinking of a protocol for turn 0
2011-02-09T02:18:21  <McLeopold> send info, send "ready", receive "go", send turn 1 stuff, receive "go", etc
2011-02-09T02:18:34  <McLeopold> It makes the starter bot look simple
2011-02-09T02:18:53  <McLeopold> if "ready" then setup else if "go" then do turn
2011-02-09T02:21:21  <McLeopold> woot, sandbox working
2011-02-09T02:24:00  <McLeopold> I seem to need to do a sys.stdout.flush in the bot
2011-02-09T02:24:06  <McLeopold> that seems weird
2011-02-09T02:24:19  <McLeopold> Zannick: ^^ ?
2011-02-09T02:24:22  <Frontier> Zannick: Where should the server_info.py go? Should I just create one in my backend directory for testing?
2011-02-09T02:24:52  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what's wrong with what's on etherpad?
2011-02-09T02:25:10  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm not looking at etherpad write now
2011-02-09T02:25:15  <Zannick> McLeopold: i don't know; might have been the case in the contest, too
2011-02-09T02:25:36  <Zannick> Frontier: you don't really need one; it's for connecting to the server sql database
2011-02-09T02:25:37  <antimatroid> McLeopold: can you go and look if you want to talk io :P
2011-02-09T02:25:48  <McLeopold> not right now
2011-02-09T02:25:48  <Zannick> Frontier: i just always turned everything off that used that
2011-02-09T02:25:56  <McLeopold> maybe when your sleeping ;)
2011-02-09T02:27:06  <Frontier> Zannick: I want to check that the additional line in the sql table is working as well.
2011-02-09T02:27:18  <McLeopold> starter pack did do a fllush
2011-02-09T02:28:16  <Zannick> Frontier: then yeah, just put it somewhere that the scripts that import it can reach it
2011-02-09T02:28:45  <CIA-37> aichallenge: Scott Hamilton epsilon * rd89dfe6 / (4 files in 2 dirs): Added sandbox for testing engine. Will rewrite engine to use this instead. - http://bit.ly/hRQVUf

2011-02-09T03:07:11  <antimatroid> simplicity ftw
2011-02-09T03:20:46  <Frontier> Zannick: Does the compiler have to be available as and produce 64-bit executables? I just recalled that D doesn't have 64-bit support yet.
2011-02-09T03:21:02  <Zannick> i'm not sure about server specs
2011-02-09T03:21:24  <Zannick> i don't think it's 64bit
2011-02-09T03:21:35  <Frontier> I think the cloud servers are
2011-02-09T03:22:13  <Zannick> again, i don't know for sure
2011-02-09T03:22:58  <janzert> the servers used in the last contest were 32bit only
2011-02-09T03:23:35  <janzert> I'm hoping the ones used in the future can be 64bit, but for sure should still support 32bit applications as well
2011-02-09T03:23:53  <Frontier> ok, so that's no problem. i'm done. i put it all in a forum post now

2011-02-09T04:17:44  <antimatroid> does anyone know if McLeopold is planning to allow friend ants to "swap" squares?
2011-02-09T04:17:53  <antimatroid> i think it's easier to allow it
2011-02-09T04:18:57  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: what do you think about ants "swapping" squares?
2011-02-09T04:23:13  <antimatroid> oh god, i had a game idea, not for now or ever, it would be madness
2011-02-09T04:23:28  <antimatroid> wait, nevermind, it doesn't work
2011-02-09T04:24:17  <antimatroid> hmm, what about tron, but you can move any of your blocked squares in a turn instead of a designated head, but only one ..
2011-02-09T04:24:49  <antimatroid> you'd get long games
2011-02-09T04:25:57  <antimatroid> multiplayer knights tour would be cool, can't land in a square that's already been landed in..

2011-02-09T10:01:25  <jmcarthur> hmm... is the intuition that the "head" can move anywhere within the "tail" and poke out of it from anywhere? i guess kind of like movement amon connected territories in risk?

2011-02-09T10:16:00  <janzert> yeah, I think another equivalent description of antimatroid's game is each player starts with one square of territory every turn you must expand your territory to one adjacent square, the first player unable to expand loses
2011-02-09T10:16:41  <janzert> I do think it would actually be rather interesting
2011-02-09T10:17:16  <jmcarthur> so do it
2011-02-09T10:17:18  <jmcarthur> *i
2011-02-09T10:17:46  <jmcarthur> assuming either the maps aren't too big or there are more than 2 players
2011-02-09T10:18:42  <jmcarthur> there's still the question of what to do if two players try to, err, "poke" the same square at the same time
2011-02-09T10:21:21  <janzert> hmm, yeah need some resolution rule there. probably just turn it into a 'wall'
2011-02-09T10:21:46  <janzert> i.e. neutral unclaimable territory
2011-02-09T10:23:02  *** Meatkat <Meatkat!~bovard@217.113.66.228> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-09T10:23:08  <janzert> also instead of first person unable to expand loses, score by size of territory and it both makes it natural for multiplayer and allows you to short circuit filling in any territory completely surrounded by one player
2011-02-09T10:23:21  <janzert> or rather only reachable by one player
2011-02-09T10:24:45  <janzert> for 2 players it's still equivalent to the above
2011-02-09T10:26:06  <janzert> not sure it'd be a good fit for the contest, but it seems like it might be fun to play around with sometime
2011-02-09T10:30:35  <jmcarthur> seems easy to write, too

2011-02-09T13:03:49  <antimatroid> McLeopold: good about swapping, that makes everything much easier
2011-02-09T13:04:10  <antimatroid> i'm currently playing around with the different battle resolutsion/region sizes and what happens with food squares
2011-02-09T13:05:50  <McLeopold> k
2011-02-09T13:06:32  <McLeopold> so, there was the option to kill closest ants first, iteratively
2011-02-09T13:06:47  <McLeopold> and there's the option to kill all ants in range, regardless of closeness.
2011-02-09T13:07:03  <McLeopold> let's call them A and B
2011-02-09T13:07:11  <McLeopold> A is closer to 1:1

2011-02-09T13:09:55  <antimatroid> Why isn't octal a funny number system? Because 7 10 11.
2011-02-09T13:11:11  <McLeopold> :/
2011-02-09T13:11:36  <McLeopold> B is easier to code, locally deterministic
2011-02-09T13:11:44  <McLeopold> Both allow for some micro
2011-02-09T13:12:00  <antimatroid> i want micro to be a defining feature of the game
2011-02-09T13:12:02  <McLeopold> The micro in A is more advanced and harder to get the 2:1 kill
2011-02-09T13:12:21  <McLeopold> The micro in B is easier to get the 2:1
2011-02-09T13:12:53  <antimatroid> in either instance, you want to fight with single ants yes?
2011-02-09T13:12:54  <McLeopold> Jeff's okay with either.  I think B will the the easiest to explain and understand at a glance
2011-02-09T13:13:00  <antimatroid> with the other option, you want to roam around in small packs
2011-02-09T13:13:35  <McLeopold> small packs would still be okay, you just need to split when you see an ant, or send out an interceptor from the pack
2011-02-09T13:13:40  <antimatroid> so you're not even considering jmcarthur's rule anymore?
2011-02-09T13:13:56  <McLeopold> No, because Jeff doesn't want blocking.
2011-02-09T13:14:02  <McLeopold> I still like it, I've just lost hope.
2011-02-09T13:14:09  <antimatroid> there's only blocking very small widths
2011-02-09T13:14:27  <antimatroid> as far as i can tell, jeff is pretty much the only person opposed to that option
2011-02-09T13:14:51  <jmcarthur> and the only person that needs to be convinced
2011-02-09T13:14:55  <jmcarthur> :\
2011-02-09T13:15:01  <McLeopold> So, jmcarthur and my *original* proposal?  Or something else?
2011-02-09T13:15:24  <McLeopold> I pretty sure our original allowed for blocking.
2011-02-09T13:15:35  <antimatroid> McLeopold: aba with your new option A kills all three yes?
2011-02-09T13:15:42  <antimatroid> i think that's silly
2011-02-09T13:15:47  <jmcarthur> the enemies of enemies one only allowed for blocking of like 1-wide corridors
2011-02-09T13:15:48  <McLeopold> with both A and B, yes
2011-02-09T13:16:23  <antimatroid> a.b.a for an actual example that can happen
2011-02-09T13:16:30  <antimatroid> i think b should die in that encounter and only b
2011-02-09T13:17:33  <jmcarthur> one 'a' dying along with the 'b' would also make sense, but it would be nondeterministic, which makes this an obvious choice for me
2011-02-09T13:19:01  <antimatroid> McLeopold: basically, i'm not wanting to give up on that rule, i think it's far superior to the others
2011-02-09T13:19:05  <antimatroid> :P
2011-02-09T13:19:27  *** Apophis <Apophis!~apophis@80-219-211-230.dclient.hispeed.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-09T13:19:34  <McLeopold> Okay, from a macro level, with a less than 1:1 option, the micro allows you to kill 2 ants with 1
2011-02-09T13:19:55  <McLeopold> with a more that 1:1, it allows you to defend without losses
2011-02-09T13:20:18  <McLeopold> Jeff has been okay with less than 1:1 kill ratios, but not more.
2011-02-09T13:20:45  <McLeopold> I may have the less/more backwards, but I hope you know what I'm going for.
2011-02-09T13:20:52  <antimatroid> i think it should be costly to take someone's region?
2011-02-09T13:20:59  <antimatroid> favouring defending yes?
2011-02-09T13:21:20  <McLeopold> So, you need to convince Jeff that being able to defend well, as a strategy, is better than being able to kill effeciently.
2011-02-09T13:21:55  <McLeopold> Ultimately, it would be a difference in clumping ants, or spreading them out.
2011-02-09T13:22:16  <McLeopold> Jeff has been against clumping and formation being a part of the game.
2011-02-09T13:22:42  <antimatroid> i am in favour of that, i think it would make it more interesting strategically and visually
2011-02-09T13:23:11  <antimatroid> and i don't see it as being much different what people need to do in order to play "well" in either case
2011-02-09T13:23:16  <McLeopold> So, convince Jeff.  I will support it.  But for now, I'm trying to move the contest forward by getting something up and running.
2011-02-09T13:23:30  <antimatroid> j3camero: are you about?
2011-02-09T13:25:08  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you still showing dead ants?
2011-02-09T13:25:16  <antimatroid> i think it might be nice to know what team it was from?
2011-02-09T13:25:28  <antimatroid> what if dead ants were capitals? and were equivalent to '.'?
2011-02-09T13:26:27  <McLeopold> That would work
2011-02-09T13:26:39  <antimatroid> that way you can count the number of dead ants you see of each other player
2011-02-09T13:26:45  <McLeopold> but, we couldn't have rules where 2 ants land on the same square
2011-02-09T13:26:54  <antimatroid> true
2011-02-09T13:27:08  <McLeopold> Actually, if we give the orders of the ant, you would know.
2011-02-09T13:27:18  <antimatroid> that may give reason to use the larger fighting region, other than it being easier to do the visualiser
2011-02-09T13:27:27  <McLeopold> I'm thinking something like:
2011-02-09T13:27:45  <McLeopold> [AD] from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y
2011-02-09T13:27:52  <McLeopold> a=ant, d=dead_ant
2011-02-09T13:27:57  <McLeopold> a=alive_ant
2011-02-09T13:28:15  <antimatroid> wait, are you still using x and y instead of row/col?
2011-02-09T13:28:30  <McLeopold> for bot communication, yes
2011-02-09T13:28:38  <McLeopold> internal storage is row/col
2011-02-09T13:28:59  <antimatroid> i'd rather everything was row/col if possible, it's consistent :P
2011-02-09T13:29:12  <jmcarthur> i think for bot communication x,y is fine
2011-02-09T13:29:21  <McLeopold> it's easier to explain x,y
2011-02-09T13:29:30  <antimatroid> how?
2011-02-09T13:29:36  <antimatroid> go to row, go to col, there
2011-02-09T13:29:38  <antimatroid> s your element
2011-02-09T13:30:04  <McLeopold> cause the x axis is always horizontal
2011-02-09T13:30:20  <McLeopold> idk, it doesn't matter
2011-02-09T13:30:40  <McLeopold> you maps may all be sideways. ;)
2011-02-09T13:30:44  <antimatroid> printing a map that was used as x,y is tricker
2011-02-09T13:31:32  <McLeopold> well, not as efficient, but still easy
2011-02-09T13:31:44  <antimatroid> requires more thought
2011-02-09T13:31:52  <jmcarthur> transpose is an easy function to use
2011-02-09T13:32:22  <McLeopold> if you can convince jeff of alternate combat rules, I'll go row/col
2011-02-09T13:32:28  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-02-09T13:32:31  <McLeopold> :)
2011-02-09T13:32:35  <antimatroid> challenge accepted
2011-02-09T13:35:08  <antimatroid> McLeopold: can you make "kill all fighting ants" option 3/C?
2011-02-09T13:35:09  <antimatroid> i'
2011-02-09T13:35:17  <antimatroid> ll make it the third branch on those images
2011-02-09T13:35:48  <antimatroid> has anything been decided about fight region?
2011-02-09T13:36:13  <antimatroid> i think it's nice if ants can't land in the same square, it's easier to program, easier to visualise, would allow showing dead ants as before...
2011-02-09T13:37:18  <McLeopold> yeah, I'd rather have a range of at least sqrt(5)
2011-02-09T13:37:41  <antimatroid> is that the 2 square?
2011-02-09T13:37:47  <antimatroid> 5*?
2011-02-09T13:38:00  <McLeopold> it's the range of a knight in chess
2011-02-09T13:38:02  <antimatroid> i think that means you can't have a draw for food squares?
2011-02-09T13:38:26  <McLeopold> or, 5x5 box without the corners
2011-02-09T13:38:35  <antimatroid> oh, isn't that just 2 then?
2011-02-09T13:38:50  <McLeopold> that would be sqrt(4)
2011-02-09T13:39:04  <McLeopold> and miss the knight moves
2011-02-09T13:39:13  <antimatroid> oh, i see
2011-02-09T13:39:13  <McLeopold> it would be a diamond
2011-02-09T13:39:34  <antimatroid> wait, i see
2011-02-09T13:40:07  <antimatroid> what's the benefit to that over 2?
2011-02-09T13:40:18  <McLeopold> --a----a-- would be a minimal defense line for a 10 wide passage
2011-02-09T13:40:30  <McLeopold> um, more death?
2011-02-09T13:41:01  <McLeopold> it's not a tessellation, so there is no "perfect" defense coverage
2011-02-09T13:41:44  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2011-02-09T13:42:30  <McLeopold> so, wanna go with hex grids?
2011-02-09T13:42:51  <jmcarthur> i'm curious what it'd be like
2011-02-09T13:43:17  <antimatroid> hex grids would be cool, but harder to do sliding squares?
2011-02-09T13:43:20  <antimatroid> hexes*
2011-02-09T13:43:41  <jmcarthur> it would just have to be a jittering square instead
2011-02-09T13:44:11  <antimatroid> you could play on a directed graph
2011-02-09T13:44:13  <antimatroid> that'd be madness
2011-02-09T13:44:30  <jmcarthur> it'd be sparta!
2011-02-09T13:44:53  <antimatroid> i think the square grid would be fine?
2011-02-09T13:45:11  <antimatroid> well, rectangle :P
2011-02-09T13:45:16  <jmcarthur> no reason not to consider hex
2011-02-09T13:45:24  <jmcarthur> what if it has some cooler strategies?
2011-02-09T13:45:39  <McLeopold> can you wrap hex?
2011-02-09T13:45:47  <antimatroid> sure, but there's already a few options for a few different thinks
2011-02-09T13:45:53  <antimatroid> McLeopold: hmm...
2011-02-09T13:45:56  <jmcarthur> if it's an even number of rows/columns
2011-02-09T13:46:48  <McLeopold> if it's a tessellation, you can wrap
2011-02-09T13:48:21  <antimatroid> yeah it can be done
2011-02-09T13:48:26  <McLeopold> you could wrap in 3 direction if it was a giant hexagon, I wonder what shape it would be?
2011-02-09T13:53:17  <antimatroid> your fight distance would be 2?
2011-02-09T13:53:28  <antimatroid> with a sort of hex manhatten dist
2011-02-09T13:54:10  <antimatroid> it has the nice appeal that every "adjacent" square is at an equal distance by any metric
2011-02-09T13:54:36  <antimatroid> well, not counting normal manhatten
2011-02-09T13:54:47  <antimatroid> any reasonable metric
2011-02-09T14:03:28  <antimatroid> am i right that options 2 and new3 are equivalent on a hex grid with fight radius 1?

2011-02-09T14:15:35  <Frontier> Now add to the mix that the ants can only see what lies in front of them and you get some sneek attacks
2011-02-09T14:17:00  <McLeopold> they would need an orientation
2011-02-09T14:17:49  <jmcarthur> orientation would suck, i think
2011-02-09T14:18:08  <McLeopold> it wouldn't be hard to implement, but suck for the bot writers
2011-02-09T14:20:48  <antimatroid> i'm fairly opposed to things that make coding unecessarily complicated without sufficient strategy complexity increase

2011-02-09T14:32:57  <antimatroid> with the other methods, i think you just want to put a single ant in the middle of the passage with a gap between it

2011-02-09T14:55:48  <foucist> hmm
2011-02-09T14:55:56  <Frontier> when ants come close to each other they start dying one way or another
2011-02-09T14:55:59  <foucist> how does it differ from galcon ?
2011-02-09T14:56:06  <foucist> i mean in terms of actual AI development
2011-02-09T14:56:45  <Frontier> maybe someone else should answer that.
2011-02-09T14:57:31  <foucist> i don't know too much, but seemed like the majority of the AI solutions for the galcon contest was mostly heuristic?
2011-02-09T14:57:51  <Frontier> You have full control of your agents at any turn, food turns into ants and disapears, the way you position each ant can have a big influence
2011-02-09T14:59:24  <Frontier> foucist: They WERE mostly heuristic. What do you think could make the solutions more 'ai'?
2011-02-09T14:59:59  <foucist> well is heuristic even AI by definition?
2011-02-09T15:00:44  <foucist> i guess ultimately an ai solution would be something that is more meta-..  i.e. comes up with hte heuristics itself
2011-02-09T15:00:45  <Frontier> When it comes to video games every software that plays the game is called an ai
2011-02-09T15:00:58  <foucist> yeah
2011-02-09T15:02:01  <Frontier> This contest is not especially scientific, so for most this definition will suffice. But nothing stops you from writing software that writes software :)

2011-02-09T15:22:53  <Frontier> I think a loaded term, is a term with a loose definition
2011-02-09T15:23:54  <jmcarthur> Frontier: to me, "loaded" just means that it is commonly *associated* with some things, not that it's taken to *mean* those things

2011-02-09T19:08:54  <amstan> Frontier: dude.. we don't even have C working
2011-02-09T19:08:59  <amstan> stop stressing out over it
2011-02-09T19:09:07  <janzert> hmm, I'm not really sure who's working on that part
2011-02-09T19:09:13  <janzert> possibly jbroman
2011-02-09T19:09:21  <janzert> or possibly nobody right now :(
2011-02-09T19:09:25  <amstan> jbroman's working on zeta
2011-02-09T19:09:40  <janzert> yes, but on the compiler and such right?
2011-02-09T19:09:48  <amstan> worker, yes
2011-02-09T19:09:55  <janzert> integrating it with zeta would be good
2011-02-09T19:09:56  <Frontier> amstan: I'm not accoun ;), but the times I asked you about the next steps you alwas timed out
2011-02-09T19:10:12  <jbroman> I'm here, but what about Zeta?
2011-02-09T19:10:27  <amstan> jbroman: frontier's eager about getting D working
2011-02-09T19:10:32  <janzert> mind adding in the information for a new language?
2011-02-09T19:10:55  <jbroman> We could, I suppose, but currently the entire compilation logic for Zeta is still in flux.
2011-02-09T19:11:10  <jbroman> So I'm not sure whether there's any advantage to putting it in now as opposed to later.
2011-02-09T19:11:22  <Frontier> Zeta isn't my target. I would like to go for the old branch
2011-02-09T19:11:27  <janzert> just that it doesn't get lost that way
2011-02-09T19:11:59  <jbroman> Well, if you send it to me I can put it in zeta. Haven't looked at epsilon much, so someone else might be better for that.
2011-02-09T19:12:02  <amstan> Frontier: we're still in flux with epsilon too
2011-02-09T19:12:09  <Frontier> Once a language is working in one branch it can easily be ported to the other I hope
2011-02-09T19:13:30  <jbroman> Frontier: Probably. The marginal effort of adding a language is fairly small.
2011-02-09T19:14:26  <Frontier> I posted the required information on the forums: http://www.ai-contest.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1315&p=8624#p8624
2011-02-09T19:14:36  <McLeopold> amstan: are we still shooting for the zeta re-write?
2011-02-09T19:14:47  <amstan> McLeopold: umm, yes?
2011-02-09T19:14:49  <McLeopold> for this next contest?
2011-02-09T19:14:53  <amstan> oh..
2011-02-09T19:14:54  <amstan> idk
2011-02-09T19:15:04  <amstan> i wanna work on zeta either way
2011-02-09T19:15:09  <McLeopold> yea
2011-02-09T19:15:36  <McLeopold> I've almost got an engine going with stdin/stdout communication going, with fog of war and centering
2011-02-09T19:15:42  <Frontier> (I don't know how you go about the package installation or the database so I couldn't go into detail there)
2011-02-09T19:18:10  * Frontier didn't know zeta could be ready for this term! That changes everything a bit.
2011-02-09T19:18:33  <jbroman> I wouldn't expect the Ants contest to run on Zeta.
2011-02-09T19:18:38  <jbroman> that will almost certainly be Epsilon.

2011-02-09T19:29:15  <Frontier> jbroman: By all means take your time with the core code. I see there are quite a few new ideas, like the new scoring system, less database load or binary submissions
2011-02-09T19:33:25  <McLeopold> who's working on the zeta engine?
2011-02-09T19:33:52  <McLeopold> I mean, the thing that manages the bots, that you would plug a game into.
2011-02-09T19:34:10  <jbroman> McLeopold: I've written some of it, but it's early-stage at the moment in Zeta.
2011-02-09T19:34:16  <j3camero> Okay I am here. I have a solid few hours to work on things finally.
2011-02-09T19:34:37  <McLeopold> sweet, I should catch you up to where I am
2011-02-09T19:35:18  <j3camero> jbroman: what do you think of making a zeta game engine just be like a bot. It would run in the same sort of sandbox and communicate with the general engine stub through its own stdin and stdout?
2011-02-09T19:35:38  <j3camero> Yeah McLeopold catch me up. Can you commit your latest code and I will pull it down now?
2011-02-09T19:36:13  <McLeopold> Um, it's broken, give me 10 minutes...
2011-02-09T19:36:24  <McLeopold> unless you just want to see
2011-02-09T19:37:02  <j3camero> Yeah just want to see.
2011-02-09T19:37:08  <j3camero> It's okay to break the build hah.
2011-02-09T19:37:39  <jbroman> j3camero: I'm not sure what you mean.
2011-02-09T19:38:03  <j3camero> jbroman: just thinking forward to letting people submit new game engines the way they currently submit bots.
2011-02-09T19:38:11  <jbroman> The current architecture that exists (minimally) in Zeta is to have a Python module that implements the game.
2011-02-09T19:38:14  <antimatroid> McLeopold: is there any need to give people relative coordinates?
2011-02-09T19:38:19  <McLeopold> http://pastebin.com/ALtM8tZm
2011-02-09T19:38:21  <antimatroid> it makes it harder to debug when you aren't where you thought
2011-02-09T19:38:26  * antimatroid reads up the rest
2011-02-09T19:38:43  <j3camero> jbroman: I think that's a great way to do it, especially for now. I don't see letting people submit new game engines for a while yet.
2011-02-09T19:38:46  <jbroman> j3camero: Out of curiosity, why would we run a game whose judge we don't trust?
2011-02-09T19:39:10  <jbroman> This architecture still lets us write a shim game that goes and runs some untrusted engine if we wanted to, I guess.
2011-02-09T19:39:50  <j3camero> jbroman: I am picturing a site that is like Project Euler, where each "problem" is a contest. The user-submitted contests would be ranked based on participation. People would submit shit engines, most of them would be shit actually, but the good ones would bubble up to the top Reddit-style.
2011-02-09T19:40:11  <j3camero> jbroman: you're right. The idea I'm pitching now is probably a distraction. Forget it.
2011-02-09T19:41:31  <Zannick> i disagree with the notion above that the compilation architecture in zeta is in flux ;)
2011-02-09T19:41:32  <j3camero> Wait, are we back on amstan/aichallenge?

2011-02-09T19:42:51  <Zannick> yeah
2011-02-09T19:43:11  <Zannick> i'm mostly done with it unless there are other serious things that need changing
2011-02-09T19:43:11  <j3camero> McLeopold: did that last commit of yours have the latest work on the engine that you've done?
2011-02-09T19:43:15  <McLeopold> so, the pastebin above is an example of 1 map where the different perspectives are given to the players
2011-02-09T19:43:20  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-09T19:43:24  <Zannick> unless you refer to the part where the worker is told to compile x
2011-02-09T19:43:45  <McLeopold> You'll notice each player thinks he's 'a'.
2011-02-09T19:44:02  <j3camero> McLeopold: sweet
2011-02-09T19:44:27  <jbroman> Zannick: There's that bit of it. I also don't want to declare it done until we can verify that it works the way we want with everything else.
2011-02-09T19:44:36  <Zannick> absolutely.

2011-02-09T19:44:52  <McLeopold> so there's some main functions in the game that I can see every game needing.
2011-02-09T19:44:56  <antimatroid> j3camero: i don't know about user submitted games so much, i'd prefer to have a bunch of well made games people can pick from, then run a large contest with a specific new game every, maybe, year at that point?
2011-02-09T19:45:13  <McLeopold> My engine is just calling those functions.
2011-02-09T19:45:22  <j3camero> jbroman: the compile logic would probably be a good place to start introducing unit tests. I don't know how big you are on testable development but it gives me a huge boner.
2011-02-09T19:45:24  <McLeopold> If this were java, I would have made an interface.
2011-02-09T19:45:41  <jbroman> j3camero: You're welcome to write unit tests as well.
2011-02-09T19:45:49  <Zannick> we really could use a testing framework for everything the worker does
2011-02-09T19:45:49  <j3camero> jbroman: oh yes of course haha.
2011-02-09T19:46:01  <Zannick> everything the manager does, too
2011-02-09T19:46:10  <jbroman> Also, would you mind if I made the args the first constructor arg of System(), and just shlex-ed it? i.e. System("gcc -O2 -c {file}", sourceglobs=["*.c"]) as opposed to System(sourceglobs=["*.c"], args=["gcc","-O2","-c","{file}"])
2011-02-09T19:46:18  <j3camero> As far as I know everything is being done in Python. So the default Python unittest module is pretty awesome.
2011-02-09T19:46:36  <jbroman> Zannick: Not critical, I just like it better aesthetically myself.

2011-02-09T19:50:51  <Zannick> hm, yeah, you need to shlex split before replacing file

2011-02-09T19:52:30  <McLeopold> if we give them the whole map as an ascii picture, then there shouldn't be an issue

2011-02-09T19:55:26  <McLeopold> I've built in a "reveal" matrix in the engine to support the second way.
2011-02-09T19:55:33  <Zannick> my entire music library has files like that :<
2011-02-09T19:55:41  <McLeopold> I'll start working on that next.
2011-02-09T19:55:45  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I don't think relative coordinates adds anything to the game? am i wrong?
2011-02-09T19:56:05  <Frontier> Zannick: Generally not, but a Java class cannot have spaces. Never mind ^^
2011-02-09T19:56:11  <j3camero> McLeopold: sorry I don't understand. Are you planning on sending every visible tile every turn?
2011-02-09T19:56:13  *** Mathnerd314 <Mathnerd314!~mathnerd3@dsl.6.28.53.206.cos.dyn.pcisys.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2011-02-09T19:56:16  <McLeopold> It did when we were going to hide the map size
2011-02-09T19:56:31  <Zannick> well, java was a poor example, then
2011-02-09T19:56:42  <McLeopold> j3camero, only land/wall the first time seen, food and ants every turn
2011-02-09T19:56:46  <Zannick> 'break your server.c'
2011-02-09T19:57:00  <j3camero> McLeopold: on map size, I believe we should do things the simple way. Send them the map size up front, and use absolute coords instead of relative.
2011-02-09T19:57:16  <McLeopold> okay, I'll take the relative coords out.
2011-02-09T19:57:30  <McLeopold> But, we should keep them for the visualizer.
2011-02-09T19:57:35  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: i could change my opinion there if it actually changed anything?
2011-02-09T19:57:42  <j3camero> McLeopold: that's the way I want to do things. Send the land/water status of each tile only once per game as they are discovered, then send the status of all visible ants and food every turn.
2011-02-09T19:58:05  <McLeopold> also, we wanted to send the status of killed ants
2011-02-09T19:58:09  <antimatroid1> j3camero: food squares can change
2011-02-09T19:58:10  <antimatroid1> ants die
2011-02-09T19:58:38  <antimatroid1> j3camero: if we don't allow enemy ants to land in the same square ever, you can communicate a dead ant with just the capital of their player char
2011-02-09T19:58:40  <j3camero> Why not send a list of ants and food every turn? If they die they stop getting sent.
2011-02-09T19:58:48  <antimatroid1> but that requires the larger fighting region
2011-02-09T19:58:57  <McLeopold> because it may be difficult to determine which ant went where
2011-02-09T19:59:08  <antimatroid1> j3camero: that's not such a bad idea
2011-02-09T19:59:10  <McLeopold> if it's on the edge of vision, it could become more complicated
2011-02-09T19:59:46  <McLeopold> it extra information to try an analyze your opponent, and it's extra info to make the visualizer look cool
2011-02-09T20:00:01  <McLeopold> I would at least like to send the location of dead ants.
2011-02-09T20:00:16  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: store info of dead ants on grid, for each player, scan out and print ant/food info?
2011-02-09T20:00:16  <j3camero> McLeopold: I say don't worry about it. When an ant dies it just disappears. I really doubt many bots will care about sorting out the precise history of the current game state.
2011-02-09T20:00:23  <jbroman> Zannick: Also, the runner chdirs into the directory of the bot, do you mind if I simplify the logic a bit so that we don't have to insert the path into the runner commadn?
2011-02-09T20:00:27  <jbroman> s/commadn/command/
2011-02-09T20:00:27  <McLeopold> It would be nice to attempt to count the ants your opponent has and the losses they take.
2011-02-09T20:00:31  <antimatroid1> j3camero: i wouldn't mind that data
2011-02-09T20:00:55  <antimatroid1> you could try to guess how good each opponent is
2011-02-09T20:00:56  <Zannick> jbroman: subprocess.Popen doc:
2011-02-09T20:01:01  <Zannick> If cwd is not None, the child’s current directory will be changed to cwd before it is executed. Note that this directory is not considered when searching the executable, so you can’t specify the program’s path relative to cwd.
2011-02-09T20:01:23  <j3camero> I guess there is no harm adding a new message type like "DEATH player_id x y" or something.
2011-02-09T20:01:33  <McLeopold> Yeah, that's what I want.
2011-02-09T20:01:42  <antimatroid1> can we not have player id's
2011-02-09T20:01:43  <Zannick> this isn't a problem for eg, python, but executables need to be referenced directly
2011-02-09T20:01:45  <antimatroid1> it's not needed
2011-02-09T20:01:47  <McLeopold> I'll put it in for now, we can rip it out if it doesn't work well.
2011-02-09T20:01:52  <antimatroid1> and complicates the programs a lot
2011-02-09T20:02:31  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: you are always player 'a', the second player you discover is always player 'b'
2011-02-09T20:02:40  <Zannick> unless you change the run command for them to "cd . && ./MyBot" or something hacky
2011-02-09T20:02:41  <McLeopold> so there are relative player ids
2011-02-09T20:02:55  <jbroman> Zannick: OK, I'll concede that one.
2011-02-09T20:02:59  <antimatroid1> oh, nevermind
2011-02-09T20:03:05  <antimatroid1> i was thinking ant_id
2011-02-09T20:03:08  <antimatroid1> that's what i don't want :P
2011-02-09T20:03:13  <McLeopold> no ant ids
2011-02-09T20:04:22  <j3camero> McLeopold: what's the deal with the current sandbox? This is the old skeleton of the VM-based sandbox from the looks of it. Have you changed this at all?
2011-02-09T20:04:39  <McLeopold> j3camero: yes, but it is for testing only
2011-02-09T20:04:54  <McLeopold> I'm hoping the engine can be plugged into another system.
2011-02-09T20:04:58  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I quite like my current io on etherpad, you could change the bot io for map data as per here, but otherwise it's really easy to handle input with
2011-02-09T20:05:03  <j3camero> McLeopold: if you don't mind, I will replace it with the user_sadbox, which is the sandbox that we used for Planet Wars.
2011-02-09T20:05:33  <McLeopold> It's pretty much the same thing, with the jail stuff taken out.
2011-02-09T20:05:35  <Zannick> j3camero: that is basically a stripped down version of the user_sadbox, i believe
2011-02-09T20:05:56  <McLeopold> leave it in, for testing
2011-02-09T20:05:58  <janzert> j3camero: note though that sandbox used for planetwars is *not* the one in the backend directory
2011-02-09T20:06:10  <janzert> it's the one from the workers
2011-02-09T20:06:23  <j3camero> janzert: ah okay I didn't realize.
2011-02-09T20:06:34  <j3camero> janzert: where do I find the sandbox that I want?
2011-02-09T20:06:35  <janzert> the one in the backend directory along with the engine there were not actually used for the last month
2011-02-09T20:06:37  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/WCVVcW2I   that's the kind of io by bot currently takes
2011-02-09T20:07:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: well, we are going away from ascii pictures
2011-02-09T20:07:08  <janzert> let me poke around how things are now arranged on github for a sec
2011-02-09T20:07:25  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: yeah that's fine, but the rest of it i wouldn't mind being like if possible?
2011-02-09T20:07:39  <Zannick> either way, both the old user_sadbox scripts required access to the jail_users to be used properly
2011-02-09T20:07:59  <McLeopold> j3camero: one other question, I'm storing things as map[row][col], but I was going to have the bots communicate in [x][y], so there is some translation.  thoughts?
2011-02-09T20:08:00  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: particularly the "T/F" line to say if the following lines are for the start or end of game
2011-02-09T20:08:23  <j3camero> McLeopold: yeah that's fine with me. Whatever.
2011-02-09T20:08:43  <j3camero> McLeopold: hopefully the internal representation of the maps is hidden behind some nice OO methods?
2011-02-09T20:08:44  <janzert> j3camero: it looks like the stuff in planet_wars/worker should be what was actually in use for playing games at the end of the contest
2011-02-09T20:08:50  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: actually, nevermind, throw my input out
2011-02-09T20:08:54  <j3camero> thanks janzert.
2011-02-09T20:09:03  <McLeopold> j3camero: it will be, if the sample bots are written nicely
2011-02-09T20:09:13  <j3camero> How do I copy a file in git? I tried googling it, but the answer seems... complicated...
2011-02-09T20:09:21  <McLeopold> git cp
2011-02-09T20:09:36  <j3camero> Wow why could nobody from the internet just say that. svn copy == git cp.
2011-02-09T20:09:53  <Zannick> you might have been stumbling across something else
2011-02-09T20:09:56  <amstan> j3camero: http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html
2011-02-09T20:10:00  <j3camero> Instead all you get is these tirades from ponytail-sporting DVCS zealots.
2011-02-09T20:10:13  <McLeopold> I am wrong...
2011-02-09T20:11:24  <j3camero> hmm yeah I don't know about this git cp.
2011-02-09T20:11:42  <j3camero> I checked out that page amstan. Doesn't seem to say how to just copy a file.
2011-02-09T20:11:53  <McLeopold> copy file in file system, git will "detect" it
2011-02-09T20:11:57  <Zannick> cp then git add
2011-02-09T20:12:00  <j3camero> Some people from the internet are saying just copy the file using ordinary cp then git add it.
2011-02-09T20:12:13  <j3camero> Ah nice I will just do that, as weird as it sounds.
2011-02-09T20:12:58  <amstan> j3camero: actually, yeah, git can detect even file moves
2011-02-09T20:13:23  <j3camero> That's pretty magic.
2011-02-09T20:13:40  <j3camero> I am still hurting for SVN. I will learn in time though.
2011-02-09T20:13:47  <j3camero> I have a feeling once I grok git I will like it.
2011-02-09T20:15:47  <jbroman> Zannick: OK, so here's a thought: sandboxed compilation? Some people (jmcarthur) want it, and it seems reasonable. Any reason not to?
2011-02-09T20:15:51  <j3camero> Okay McLeopold how do I invoke this engine? Are you testing this in Python interactive mode right now?
2011-02-09T20:15:57  <jbroman> We can use the same sandbox as for the bots, really.
2011-02-09T20:16:04  <Zannick> jbroman: i am +1 for this, too, actually
2011-02-09T20:16:07  <amstan> jbroman: jeff has some issues with it
2011-02-09T20:16:15  <j3camero> I do?
2011-02-09T20:16:22  <amstan> jbroman: since he's not sure how to avoid files that eat up a ton of space
2011-02-09T20:16:23  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/DqZz64cy
2011-02-09T20:16:28  <antimatroid1> that could work for io?
2011-02-09T20:16:30  <amstan> j3camero: yeah, remember, we were in that big starbucks
2011-02-09T20:16:32  <antimatroid1> well, input*
2011-02-09T20:16:41  <jbroman> amstan: How does sandboxing compilation affect this?
2011-02-09T20:16:51  <antimatroid1> oh, L and D are [*ab..]
2011-02-09T20:17:01  <amstan> jbroman: hmm... maybe i'm not understading properly
2011-02-09T20:17:12  <j3camero> I think sandboxed compilation is a great idea. The only thing that could be hard about it is you need to let the bots touch the filesystem without letting them wreck the filesystem.
2011-02-09T20:17:17  <amstan> jbroman: do you want to sandbox and allow makefiles? or just sandbox the current compile everything?
2011-02-09T20:17:23  <janzert> jbroman: yes, compilation should be sandboxed
2011-02-09T20:17:27  <janzert> even for the next contest
2011-02-09T20:17:55  <janzert> it was one of the things that left me nervous till the last one closed submissions
2011-02-09T20:18:00  <Zannick> they can't wreck the filesystem if they don't have write permissions outside their homedir
2011-02-09T20:18:04  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: http://codepad.org/GGYLAMUz what do you think of that?
2011-02-09T20:18:09  <antimatroid1> that also works if ants are landing in the same square
2011-02-09T20:18:19  <McLeopold> j3camero: some iteractive, some running the files directly, some command line
2011-02-09T20:18:20  <amstan> nullkuhl_: hey, any news?
2011-02-09T20:18:22  <janzert> Zannick: compilation is currently done under the contest user
2011-02-09T20:18:44  <janzert> so can wreck all other submissions
2011-02-09T20:19:06  <Zannick> janzert: right, but the idea behind the sandboxing is sudo to another user, compile in the homedir
2011-02-09T20:19:34  <janzert> ahh, I thought you meant currently, not when sandboxed
2011-02-09T20:19:37  <McLeopold> playgame.py -t 10 -m maps\simple1.txt "python bots\MyBot.py" "python bots\MyBot.py" "python bots\MyBot.py" "python bots\MyBot.py"
2011-02-09T20:19:48  <McLeopold> j3camero: ^^
2011-02-09T20:19:48  <Zannick> my comment is it shouldn't be difficult to "let them touch the filestystem without them destroying it"
2011-02-09T20:19:55  <Zannick> s/sty/sy/
2011-02-09T20:20:03  <janzert> yeah
2011-02-09T20:20:51  <janzert> also certain languages allow arbitrary code execution during compilation anyway (with no way to disable that) so people can do whatever they want anyway
2011-02-09T20:21:12  <Zannick> well, that's why we want to sandbox it
2011-02-09T20:21:24  <janzert> yep :)
2011-02-09T20:21:27  <nullkuhl_> amstan: yeah, worked on a few sketches today, should get something by tomorrow
2011-02-09T20:21:55  <amstan> nullkuhl_: anything that you can share?
2011-02-09T20:21:56  <nullkuhl_> amstan: will probably provide 2 different designs
2011-02-09T20:22:14  <nullkuhl_> not yet today, but tomorrow i wil
2011-02-09T20:22:17  <antimatroid1> i don't think input could be much simpler than above
2011-02-09T20:23:38  <Zannick> under a jail user, we still need to be careful, of course, but at least we can prevent them from straightforwardly rm -rf the submissions
2011-02-09T20:23:55  * janzert nods
2011-02-09T20:24:05  <jbroman> Zannick: We can't block every conceivable malicious act, just the trivial ones.
2011-02-09T20:24:15  <Zannick> yes
2011-02-09T20:24:24  <janzert> the current jail user setup really needs to get locked down a lot better though
2011-02-09T20:24:32  <jbroman> Ultimately, when you allow arbitrary users to upload code in a variety of languages that you will execute you cannot secure it completely.
2011-02-09T20:24:42  <amstan> janzert: feel free to make a wiki page with your requirements
2011-02-09T20:24:44  <janzert> also the sandbox should completely remove the jail home directory and recreate it each time
2011-02-09T20:25:21  <janzert> right now it will leave and .dot files in place that a bot creates
2011-02-09T20:25:28  <jbroman> janzert: No homedir?
2011-02-09T20:25:31  <janzert> any
2011-02-09T20:25:33  <jbroman> Not all users need have homedirs.
2011-02-09T20:26:02  <jbroman> Or does some language get angry if it can't create preference files?
2011-02-09T20:26:09  <janzert> jbroman: yeah, that'd be fine. in that case replace home directory above with bot working directory :)
2011-02-09T20:26:15  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: to the etherpad!
2011-02-09T20:27:12  <janzert> I know mono wrote a bunch of stuff under a .something directory in the jailusers but no idea if it required it
2011-02-09T20:29:48  <amstan> ugh.. spaces vs tabs... i can has tabs
2011-02-09T20:31:06  <j3camero> amstan: no tabs ffs
2011-02-09T20:31:14  <amstan> lol
2011-02-09T20:31:15  <j3camero> PEP 8.
2011-02-09T20:31:24  <amstan> i was just kidding
2011-02-09T20:33:47  <antimatroid1> what metric do people think should be used with view radius? mcleopold is using euclidean, i would have gone with manhatten?
2011-02-09T20:34:02  <antimatroid1> movement is based off of manhatten
2011-02-09T20:34:14  <j3camero> I don't see any huge advantage one way or the other.
2011-02-09T20:34:27  <antimatroid1> manhatten gives more consistency i would have thought?
2011-02-09T20:34:37  <j3camero> One way or the other might generate some pretty degenerate situations at the micro level, but I don't know.
2011-02-09T20:34:53  <antimatroid1> it's about what you can see 10ish squares out
2011-02-09T20:34:58  <antimatroid1> i think it's not too much of an issue
2011-02-09T20:35:00  <janzert> if everything could be based off manhattan it'd be a little simpler for people
2011-02-09T20:35:18  <j3camero> I'm inclined to think Manhattan is better for now yeah.
2011-02-09T20:35:26  <Chris_0076> Chebyshev ^^
2011-02-09T20:35:30  <Chris_0076> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance
2011-02-09T20:35:39  <j3camero> We'll see if people come up with a compelling reason to switch.
2011-02-09T20:35:42  <antimatroid1> that's a square^^
2011-02-09T20:36:04  <antimatroid1> chris_0076: i dunno about that for view, and with movement you'd want diagonal as well
2011-02-09T20:36:14  <amstan> @reop
2011-02-09T20:36:15  <contestbot> amstan: I do not know about 'reop', but I do know about these similar topics: 'repo'
2011-02-09T20:36:17  <amstan> @repo
2011-02-09T20:36:18  <contestbot> amstan: repo = https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-09T20:38:00  <antimatroid1> actually, i think i might see a reason for euclidean
2011-02-09T20:38:17  <antimatroid1> it gives you a larger variety of fight regions that can be picked out?
2011-02-09T20:38:27  <antimatroid1> and just work
2011-02-09T20:38:51  <Chris_0076> but the distances are finite blocks not infinite ranges =/
2011-02-09T20:39:07  <Chris_0076> or infinitesimal...
2011-02-09T20:39:46  <antimatroid1> if we did decide to not allow enemy ants to land in the same square, then manhatten can be used with fightRadius = 2 and viewRadius = r
2011-02-09T20:40:29  <j3camero> The nice thing about euclidean is it will look nicer if the visualizer shows the fog of war.
2011-02-09T20:40:50  <Chris_0076> because of circles?
2011-02-09T20:40:55  <McLeopold> j3camero: that's why I'm using it for vision
2011-02-09T20:40:55  <Chris_0076> vs squears
2011-02-09T20:40:59  <Chris_0076> squares*

2011-02-09T20:41:11  <McLeopold> and I'm using it for attack range
2011-02-09T20:41:21  <antimatroid1> i've been convinced about that
2011-02-09T20:41:37  <McLeopold> movement being n,e,s,w is just a drawback
2011-02-09T20:41:51  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: walk radius = 1
2011-02-09T20:41:52  <Chris_0076> for vision, euclidean seems more justified
2011-02-09T20:41:52  <antimatroid1> simple
2011-02-09T20:42:23  <McLeopold> j3camero: http://ietherpad.com/TR0zbEqvx1 <-- let's finalize the communication on this, just the section at the top.
2011-02-09T20:42:44  <McLeopold> Or, if you want changes, please update
2011-02-09T20:43:16  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: why not have P as one longer line?
2011-02-09T20:43:34  <McLeopold> this allows for expansion of the parameters
2011-02-09T20:43:42  <antimatroid1> fair call
2011-02-09T20:43:48  <McLeopold> it's only sent turn 0, so it's not a big deal
2011-02-09T20:43:54  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-02-09T20:44:33  <antimatroid1> i think the game specs should make it clear you only get sent L or W once for a given square in a game
2011-02-09T20:44:41  <McLeopold> yes, they should
2011-02-09T20:44:52  <McLeopold> the starter packs should be written to make that clear
2011-02-09T20:45:03  <antimatroid1> yes, but the actual game specs on the site should also point it out
2011-02-09T20:45:24  <j3camero> McLeopold: seems like a good place to start. We'll add stuff as we build up the engine.
2011-02-09T20:45:45  <antimatroid1> j3camero: i think we should finalise structure now, only changed if absolutely necessary
2011-02-09T20:46:03  <antimatroid1> mcleopold has done a good job at making it easy to make ammendments and not mess up peoples code too much
2011-02-09T20:46:13  <j3camero> antimatroid: I think what we have there is enough to get started actually building it.
2011-02-09T20:46:16  <antimatroid1> now as in soonish
2011-02-09T20:47:07  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: what is the current fight radius?

2011-02-09T20:47:20  <antimatroid1> i still think 2 would be good
2011-02-09T20:47:37  <McLeopold> okay, I'm out for the evening.  I'll check the repo later tonight.
2011-02-09T20:47:43  <j3camero> antimatroid1: that will be configurable, and we will just play with it and see what people are liking best.
2011-02-09T20:47:55  <j3camero> McLeopold: see ya. I will keep hacking on this engine.
2011-02-09T20:48:02  <antimatroid1> okay
2011-02-09T20:48:08  <McLeopold> merge my changes, they aren't too much

2011-02-09T20:48:26  <antimatroid1> j3camero: when you've given up doing work for the night i want another crack at convincing you of battle resolution method 1 :)
2011-02-09T20:49:47  <antimatroid1> also, if we do symmetric maps with symmetric food replenishment, the map gen needs to provide a bit more info to the engine
2011-02-09T20:49:50  <j3camero> antimatroid1: I will give you a listen as always.
2011-02-09T20:50:01  <antimatroid1> but that can happen once such a decision is made
2011-02-09T20:50:18  <antimatroid1> j3camero: do you want me to bombard you now or later?
2011-02-09T20:50:53  <antimatroid1> actually, i'll write it up and you can read it when you like

2011-02-09T20:52:41  <janzert> random food distribution should already encourage people to spread out, it would be nice if the fight mechanic added a bit of tension to that giving some (probably small) balancing incentive to clumping together
2011-02-09T20:54:56  <antimatroid1> janzert: if you did it with symmetric maps and symmertic to start positions, it wouldn't currently be symmetric and you would still be encouraged to spread out yeah?
2011-02-09T20:55:16  <antimatroid1> it just adds that extra bit of symmetry to the actual game
2011-02-09T20:55:30  <antimatroid1> to ensure "fairness"
2011-02-09T20:55:50  <janzert> I don't think map symmetry or lack thereof effects the above much
2011-02-09T20:56:33  <antimatroid1> i don't think it'd make much difference for anything in either instance, but when it barely changes strategy, why not err on the side of more symmetric?
2011-02-09T20:56:36  <janzert> basically it seems like there is no counter tension in the game mechanics to simply spreading fast, unless the fight mechanics introduce it

2011-02-09T20:57:24  <janzert> heh, well it seems orthogonal to me, and I think non-symmetry adds interest if it can be made fair
2011-02-09T20:57:31  <j3camero> janzert: there is an incentive to cluster ants in chokepoints to create secure border and the appearance of strength.
2011-02-09T20:57:51  <janzert> why? I don't see any reason to stop at any choke point
2011-02-09T20:57:59  <janzert> just expand through it as fast as you can
2011-02-09T20:58:20  <antimatroid1> yeah, you can always retreat if necessary
2011-02-09T20:58:25  <antimatroid1> depending on how much you sent through
2011-02-09T20:58:45  <j3camero> janzert: but when you do encounter an enemy force, the best place to fall back to is a chokepoint.
2011-02-09T20:58:56  <antimatroid1> if you get into a "block" formation, you can store information from future turns about how to return there
2011-02-09T20:58:58  <janzert> at least if fighting the best you can do is keep your ants spread out so you don't lose more than one ant for one of theirs
2011-02-09T21:00:51  <j3camero> janzert: if I charge your chokepoint with a cluster of ants I can break through and start collecting your food. That's why I think there's a strong incentive to keep ants near chokepoints.
2011-02-09T21:01:22  <janzert> if your ants are clustered I can kill at more than 1 for 1 though right?
2011-02-09T21:01:34  <janzert> so you have to spread them out
2011-02-09T21:01:54  <j3camero> Still I would want to keep them somewhat near a chokepoint.
2011-02-09T21:02:08  <j3camero> I have to be able to get them to the chokepoint in time to stop you from charging it.
2011-02-09T21:02:56  <j3camero> If your chokepoint gets charged you could get badly routed.
2011-02-09T21:02:59  <janzert> might as well push through and collect the food on the other side for as long as I can though, I'm still closer to the chokepoint than you and can reach it before you and maybe I'll find another one further on
2011-02-09T21:03:25  <j3camero> janzert: maybe if you're only fighting that one opponent.
2011-02-09T21:03:59  <janzert> any number of opponents doesn't matter I can just treat them all as simply enemy
2011-02-09T21:04:26  <j3camero> Well, your opponents to the east and west are unlikely to act in concert. That's the difference.
2011-02-09T21:05:16  <janzert> you still have to leave ants in the interior
2011-02-09T21:05:29  <janzert> when I'm talking about spreading out I mean an even density
2011-02-09T21:05:34  <j3camero> We saw in Planet Wars that the best bots always kept almost no bots on most of their planets. They preferred to concentrate all troops near potential sites of conflict. I think we will see the same here, with a few foragers eating food behind the front line.
2011-02-09T21:08:59  <janzert> in planetwars a ship that wasn't on the frontlines was useless, in ants an ant that is too close to another is useless
2011-02-09T21:09:17  <janzert> not sure how close too close will end up being :)
2011-02-09T21:15:10  <j3camero> Holy hell. This sandbox stuff all needs to get cleaned up and factored out into a nice library or something.
2011-02-09T21:15:35  <j3camero> I put this together in such a hurry before the last contest after bailing on the VM sandbox approach.

2011-02-09T21:45:04  <Prillicy> so its definitely ants then? not zombies? I kinda liked the zombie idea
2011-02-09T21:45:13  <amstan> Prillicy: ants, we had a vote
2011-02-09T21:45:42  <j3camero> I think there are a few criticisms of Option 2 in there that are pretty invalid. Also, the document does not even address my primary concern about Option 1. I can best phrase it thus: the rule is very difficult for novices to exploit. While it will be more interesting for you to tinker with (I don't deny it), you will destroy the novices so badly that they won't want to play. This concern is not addressed in the document.
2011-02-09T21:45:53  <Prillicy> darn, I had a plan, I was going to build a zombie bot, then give it the three laws, and watch as it does nothing
2011-02-09T21:47:19  <Prillicy> j3camero: any "strategy" involved in option 2 would have to be so complex as to discourage beginners to a much greater deal
2011-02-09T21:50:19  <antimatroid1> j3camero: I thought i had addressed it with the difficulty to beginners, unless a beginners spreads out, they will also get trampled by a better bot anyway, and I don't think it's going to be very easy to exploit these kind of things very well
2011-02-09T21:50:46  <antimatroid1> it also provides something clear and noticable people can do to improve the quality of their bot
2011-02-09T21:50:51  <j3camero> I think there is this perception that 1:1 death rules render all strategy moot because there is no way to make your opponent die more than you. The argument goes "if we always lose ants at the same time, then there is no strategy. It doesn't matter whether you fight or don't fight." This argument is utterly invalid.
2011-02-09T21:51:10  <antimatroid1> no, i understand you want to claim more region for larger growth
2011-02-09T21:51:24  <antimatroid1> but i think you can have that and more
2011-02-09T21:51:50  <antimatroid1> option 1 encourages both good defense and offense
2011-02-09T21:52:02  <antimatroid1> if you can surround and enemy from all sides, you're probably going to take them out pretty easily
2011-02-09T21:52:28  <antimatroid1> provided beginners are getting games mostly with people near their ranks, it really shouldn't matter that much anyway
2011-02-09T21:52:31  <j3camero> I don't think I will be able to convince you on this. You seem to believe that a good portion of the participants will have the patience to code up an algorithm that takes advantage of the tactical death conditions. I know from experience that they will not.
2011-02-09T21:53:00  <antimatroid1> they don't have to and they will still have each other to play
2011-02-09T21:53:33  <antimatroid1> i don't see any need for the game to be easy enough for someone not willing to put effort in to do well
2011-02-09T21:53:42  <antimatroid1> only that someone can get started easily and with minimal effort
2011-02-09T21:53:52  <antimatroid1> the longer the road for improvement the better surely?
2011-02-09T21:54:07  <j3camero> I disagree.
2011-02-09T21:54:37  <antimatroid1> why would you want someone who puts in minimal effort to actually rank high?

2011-02-09T21:55:21  <antimatroid1> what then?
2011-02-09T21:56:24  <j3camero> I have tried to convey it so many ways, I don't know what else to say. The problem is with the disproportionately large reward for creating an algorithm which is able to milk Rule 1.
2011-02-09T21:56:55  <antimatroid1> there is a large reward for playing any game well, it's called winning :P
2011-02-09T21:57:25  <antimatroid1> look at how bocsimacko pounded people in planet wars
2011-02-09T21:57:33  <j3camero> Think about why we don't do chess. It's because it takes days of coding before you get anything satisfying. There are very few little rewards along the way. The improvement curve is not smooth. Rather, it has a huge discontinuity.
2011-02-09T21:57:34  <antimatroid1> i didn't hear a single person say the game sucked because of that
2011-02-09T21:57:44  <antimatroid1> it's because it's already well studied i thought
2011-02-09T21:58:00  <j3camero> Nope.
2011-02-09T21:58:14  <antimatroid1> i think there are plenty of improvements with ants with option 1, even before touching micro very well
2011-02-09T21:58:52  <antimatroid1> if the starter package is about as stupid as can be without doing nothing, with a variety of increasing difficulty sample bots, they have quite a lot of work ahead
2011-02-09T21:58:58  <j3camero> It's because there is this point beyond which you can't make any improvements without knuckling down for days of coding with no rewards. At that point we would bleed participants. They would just leave.
2011-02-09T21:59:03  <antimatroid1> and the majority of the bots on the servers will most likely be at their level anyway
2011-02-09T21:59:26  <antimatroid1> i think planet wars would have had a lot less room for improvement
2011-02-09T21:59:35  <antimatroid1> there was a very big brick wall for that
2011-02-09T22:00:29  <antimatroid1> i agree with you that people should be able to make continous noticable improvements for quite a long time
2011-02-09T22:01:26  <antimatroid1> i always note that as something ideal for a game :)
2011-02-09T22:02:43  <antimatroid1> j3camero: I'll even volunteer to do an indepth discussion about how people could do a decision/game tree with "ants in fight range" to see what move right now might better your chances of a "good fight"
2011-02-09T22:02:43  <antimatroid1> i'm planning to do a tutorial for people anyway
2011-02-09T22:02:44  <j3camero> The game should be both deep and smooth. The depth is the number of visibly distinct skill levels that can fit on the leaderboard. The smoothness is the smoothness of the graph of rank vs hours of coding.
2011-02-09T22:03:08  <antimatroid1> by smoothness to you mean linear?
2011-02-09T22:03:14  <j3camero> Not linear.
2011-02-09T22:03:20  <j3camero> Just... smooth.
2011-02-09T22:03:24  <j3camero> Like, no cliffs.
2011-02-09T22:03:30  <j3camero> Or plateaus.
2011-02-09T22:03:37  <antimatroid1> okay sure, i'll agree with that
2011-02-09T22:04:01  <antimatroid1> i don't think it should necessarily be hours of coding
2011-02-09T22:04:09  <antimatroid1> there needs to be some distinction of ability in there
2011-02-09T22:04:57  <antimatroid1> i don't think there is a lack of that smoothness with 1 though?
2011-02-09T22:05:37  <antimatroid1> with pairing as in planet wars, lower ranked players are going to be playing each other most often anyway, and i don't think it's going to be easy for middle ranked players to get it right either
2011-02-09T22:05:49  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure how i'd do it very well
2011-02-09T22:06:02  <antimatroid1> i plan to use some kind of tree regardless of battle method, but even then it's tricky
2011-02-09T22:07:52  <j3camero> It's definitely a tree search sort of problem.
2011-02-09T22:08:08  <j3camero> It's not totally just straight alpha beta, but it's tree-like.
2011-02-09T22:08:25  <antimatroid1> it's not zero sum i don't tihnk
2011-02-09T22:08:48  <antimatroid1> plus unless you treat all enemies as "one" player, you have n payoffs to consider
2011-02-09T22:08:57  <antimatroid1> it's still fairly easy to do backward induction on such a tree though
2011-02-09T22:09:06  <antimatroid1> it's pretty much the same algorithm
2011-02-09T22:09:27  <antimatroid1> i've no idea if an alpha-beta like thing would work for pruning
2011-02-09T22:09:42  <antimatroid1> you're going to have to prune somewhere if there's lots of ants in "fight" range
2011-02-09T22:10:06  <antimatroid1> but i see that as a necessary goal for reaching the top of the leaderboard with either battle resolution method?
2011-02-09T22:10:42  <antimatroid1> people can also try pattern matching, and storing information about where good positions are etc.
2011-02-09T22:10:48  <antimatroid1> there's a lot of different things people can try
2011-02-09T22:11:13  <j3camero> It would be fine if there was some way to gain a proportional advantage by doing some sort of crazy tree search. The problem here is that the reward for figuring out this one aspect of the game is so monstrous that it's likely to overpower the other elements of the game. A scrappy fighter could cream a skilled general hands-down, because he is getting n-to-1 odds in battle. It's just too disproportionate.
2011-02-09T22:11:54  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure it will always be so easy for them to get the advantage, the fight arena needs to be right
2011-02-09T22:12:10  <antimatroid1> if a less skilled player goes around in a swarm and bombs in numbers, they should still do alright
2011-02-09T22:13:35  <antimatroid1> a less skilled player should at least be able to work out how to avoid walking into a trap
2011-02-09T22:13:50  <antimatroid1> and that's another thing they get to program/play around with
2011-02-09T22:13:55  <j3camero> Here's another way to think about the problem. You get a huge amount of reward for a huge amount of work. Since the algorithm for being a scrappy fighter is likely to be fairly sophisticated, it gives you zero utility until it's 100% done. So the contest will become more about who bothers putting in the time, rather than rewarding a specific insight.
2011-02-09T22:14:49  <j3camero> I mean, if you have the scrappy fighter algorithm, you could beat an army of 100 using just two ants.
2011-02-09T22:14:54  <j3camero> That's just too much.
2011-02-09T22:15:06  <j3camero> It will overpower the other aspects of strategy.
2011-02-09T22:15:22  <antimatroid1> i don't think even the number one bot would achieve such a feat
2011-02-09T22:16:09  <antimatroid1> i would expect at least the top 100 people to be playing around with micro, and i expect it to be very hard to get right, so people will be doing it at different levels of goodness
2011-02-09T22:16:34  <antimatroid1> so it wont be a "they have it or don't" thing
2011-02-09T22:17:21  <j3camero> You're right that it would still be competitive. I don't disagree. Again, the problem is with the discontinuity. There would be varying levels of goodness of the algorithm. However, you can't get one ounce of that goodness without a great deal of effort up front.
2011-02-09T22:17:54  <antimatroid1> you can assume they do nothing and work out the best position you should move into fairly easily?
2011-02-09T22:18:06  <j3camero> But once you do get that first bit of the scrappy fighting algorithm, the advantage is so monstrous as to be unreasonable.
2011-02-09T22:18:07  <antimatroid1> that would be a simple micro strategy
2011-02-09T22:18:45  <antimatroid1> most people have been in favour of option 1 as well
2011-02-09T22:19:30  <Frontier_> when i saw 1 ant kill 3 others i voted for option 1.
2011-02-09T22:19:38  <j3camero> The first thing that will occur to most people who take the time to study the death rule is to form a long straight line of ants and march forward. This is the "windshield wiper algorithm". It would cause the death of a player who does not have such an algorithm virtually n-to-0.
2011-02-09T22:20:04  <antimatroid1> j3camero: and would be fairly easy to implement
2011-02-09T22:20:12  <j3camero> How easy is it really?
2011-02-09T22:20:34  <amstan> j3camero: pretty much implement a snakebot
2011-02-09T22:20:39  <j3camero> Is it within reach of most participants? No. So is it reasonable to assign such incredible odds? I don't think so. It's a truly massive discontinuity.
2011-02-09T22:20:41  <Prillicy> j3camero: can I ask a question?
2011-02-09T22:20:43  <amstan> make sure all your ants are connected
2011-02-09T22:21:20  <antimatroid1> i think it'd be within reach of any participant that wanted to sit down and think
2011-02-09T22:21:33  <janzert> making a line of ants seems awfully easy, if we can't give beginners instructions to do that...
2011-02-09T22:21:35  <antimatroid1> and could otherwise compete (can program)
2011-02-09T22:21:40  <j3camero> The windshield wiper algorithm is interesting. It's easy to characterize its goal, but pretty hard to actually code it.
2011-02-09T22:22:08  <Prillicy> what's the purpose of this whole thing?
2011-02-09T22:22:09  <antimatroid1> j3camero; what if the starter bots were just that?
2011-02-09T22:22:38  <antimatroid1> i think it'd be better to leave it as an exercise to the participant though
2011-02-09T22:23:16  <j3camero> Prillicy: the contest means different things to different people. I started it to get more people coding for fun. So choosing a game where a single algorithmic insight results in 100-0 slaughter is not really what I'm going for.
2011-02-09T22:23:48  <Prillicy> You're jumping defensive quickly
2011-02-09T22:24:06  <Prillicy> I haven't even given an opinion on your idea since I've spoken to you
2011-02-09T22:24:13  <j3camero> Yep.
2011-02-09T22:24:35  <Prillicy> my curiosity is much simpler.  This game, what's the goal? to have the most ants at the end?
2011-02-09T22:24:35  <antimatroid1> i don't expect to see a 100-0 slaughter, but people got slaughtered all the time in planet wars
2011-02-09T22:24:39  <antimatroid1> and not just from bocsi
2011-02-09T22:25:30  <j3camero> Prillicy: basically the goal of the game is to kill your opponents ad be the last ant standing.
2011-02-09T22:25:43  <antimatroid1> the exact scoring isn't finalised yet
2011-02-09T22:25:56  <antimatroid1> although i think mcleopold is onto a winner maybe
2011-02-09T22:26:38  <Prillicy> ok, and since this is an ai contents, the idea is that the person with the best strategy wins?
2011-02-09T22:27:07  <j3camero> Pretty much yep.
2011-02-09T22:27:23  <Prillicy> so what's the purpose of the food?
2011-02-09T22:27:47  <janzert> it is converted to your new ant if you get another one close to it
2011-02-09T22:27:54  <Prillicy> *purpose
2011-02-09T22:27:55  <j3camero> When you go near food the food turns into an ant of your color.
2011-02-09T22:28:13  <jmcarthur> i think Prillicy is looking for "why is it an important part of the game?"
2011-02-09T22:28:18  <Prillicy> the food, in terms of "strategy" encourages one to spread out and risk his ants being alone and unprotected
2011-02-09T22:28:26  <antimatroid1> j3camero: simple windshield like algorithm: if an ant is less than 5 away from an enemy stand still, otherwise move to a square nearer to the closest enemy?
2011-02-09T22:28:30  <j3camero> The idea is that food is randomly palced throughout the game. So the more territory you can keep hold of, the more ants you get.
2011-02-09T22:28:42  <janzert> Prillicy: yep
2011-02-09T22:29:00  <Prillicy> and the purpose of the enemy ants?
2011-02-09T22:29:11  <antimatroid1> it's more of a freeze up and block the path algorithm
2011-02-09T22:29:12  <janzert> doing the same themselves :)
2011-02-09T22:29:26  <Prillicy> to contradict that strategy, stop you from spreading out, for fear of death
2011-02-09T22:29:44  <Prillicy> j3camero: are we in agreement in all of this?
2011-02-09T22:29:48  <j3camero> Prillicy: yep pretty much.
2011-02-09T22:29:54  <j3camero> It's a big balancing act.
2011-02-09T22:30:11  <j3camero> Expand too fast and you will die. Expand too slow and you will die. Gotta get the balance.
2011-02-09T22:30:20  <antimatroid1> we all either agree or have decent reasons for not agreeing usually i think
2011-02-09T22:30:50  <Prillicy> ok, so by your statement, keeping ants close together becomes more dangerous than having them spread out, where they might just get lucky and encounter a large group of ants and kill more enemies than allied ants die in the process
2011-02-09T22:31:35  <Prillicy> i.e. you remove the fear of enemy ants
2011-02-09T22:31:53  <j3camero> Unless there's some reason to bunch some ants together, like to have a bank of responders near a chokepoint.
2011-02-09T22:31:55  * janzert agrees completely
2011-02-09T22:32:04  <janzert> with Prillicy
2011-02-09T22:32:32  <antimatroid1> you also have the incentive to spread out for food now, option 2 favours spreading while option 1 gives a counter balance
2011-02-09T22:32:39  <antimatroid1> which is another balancing act for people
2011-02-09T22:32:48  <Prillicy> you're thinking that a map is going to counter the downside? I hadn't thought of that.  please elaborate
2011-02-09T22:32:59  <jmcarthur> the idea is that there should be a couple contradictory motivators. you should have reason to spread out (with the current rules: food and safety), and you should have reason to clump together (currently, nothing motivates this)
2011-02-09T22:33:58  <antimatroid1> i also think
2011-02-09T22:33:58  <antimatroid1> a.b.a -> a...a is better than .....
2011-02-09T22:34:04  <j3camero> I think there is reason to clump together. Having a pack of ants near a site of likely conflict means you can apply more force there faster when it's time to act.
2011-02-09T22:34:26  <Prillicy> again, that only encourages ants to stay within "sight" distance
2011-02-09T22:34:27  <jmcarthur> force is pretty meaningless when relatively few attackers can take out relatively many defenders
2011-02-09T22:34:42  <jmcarthur> so the ideal is still to spread out
2011-02-09T22:34:50  <jmcarthur> even when defending
2011-02-09T22:34:53  <Prillicy> just to keep within visible distance
2011-02-09T22:34:58  <antimatroid1> j3camero: option 2 encourages people to stand back and send single ants in, option 1 encourages you to charge in and battle each other
2011-02-09T22:35:09  <Prillicy> which is more spread out than option 1 would encourage
2011-02-09T22:35:30  <amstan> what about having the ants in a huge group, that has lots of branches
2011-02-09T22:35:41  <Prillicy> I think option 2 would discourage beginners more than option 1 tbh
2011-02-09T22:35:45  <j3camero> jmcarthur: I disagree. I could defend a chokepoint without risking bad odds in battle by placing a block of ants, say, 10 units back from a chokepoint and sending two or three ants at a time to defend it. You could stop the enemy from suicide bombing your block of ants.
2011-02-09T22:35:46  <jmcarthur> if you clump together with the option 2 rules, you lose. there is *no* case where it is better to clump together with these rules
2011-02-09T22:35:51  <antimatroid1> j3camero: i think even with option 2, if you want to be competitive at the top, you're going to need to put the work in for some kind of tree
2011-02-09T22:36:01  <jmcarthur> j3camero: why even keep a block of ants?
2011-02-09T22:36:15  <janzert> yeah, the block of ants just seems wasted
2011-02-09T22:36:16  <jmcarthur> there's just no reason to
2011-02-09T22:36:19  <antimatroid1> if you are evenly distributed, you can just stream them there
2011-02-09T22:36:22  <jmcarthur> it's *always* better to spread out
2011-02-09T22:36:56  <antimatroid1> then redistribute once the battle is over
2011-02-09T22:37:14  <jmcarthur> it's very hard to have this conversation. my cat is trying to sleep on my chest while i type
2011-02-09T22:37:27  <j3camero> I guess it's a question of latency in battle. If I ambush a section of the map with a large number of ants I can take a big block of territory before he is able to summon an army to defend.
2011-02-09T22:37:42  <Prillicy> but he doesn't need an army
2011-02-09T22:38:02  <Prillicy> he just needs to send 1 ant at a time and hope that you're a beginner who doesn't know to program his ants to move 1 at a time to defend
2011-02-09T22:38:03  <jmcarthur> j3camero: the thing is that you never need an army
2011-02-09T22:38:08  <jmcarthur> j3camero: it's better not to have an army at all
2011-02-09T22:40:06  <jmcarthur> or at the most, an evenly spaced army
2011-02-09T22:40:28  <jmcarthur> just make a "dot formation" over the entire map
2011-02-09T22:40:40  <j3camero> Isn't that like saying that it's just as good to spread your ships evenly across your planets in Planet Wars? Clearly there's an advantage to having large armies at the front line ready to defend.
2011-02-09T22:41:00  <antimatroid1> j3camero: no, because you wanted to get ships there as fast as possible
2011-02-09T22:41:00  <j3camero> Or attack as the case may be.
2011-02-09T22:41:10  <antimatroid1> whereas here you want a stream of ants
2011-02-09T22:41:11  <jmcarthur> j3camero: planet wars was entirely different. a fleet with one ship couldn't take out a fleet with 3 ships
2011-02-09T22:41:14  <antimatroid1> spaced
2011-02-09T22:41:14  <janzert> there was no disadvantage to too many ships
2011-02-09T22:41:26  <janzert> at a single point that was then attacked
2011-02-09T22:41:37  <Prillicy> j3camero: I think I see where the confusion comes from.  It
2011-02-09T22:42:00  <Prillicy> I think the premise of option 2 is simply contradictory to the way the situation would work in real life.
2011-02-09T22:42:23  <antimatroid1> j3camero: a beginner who doesn't manage to spread out with option 2 also stands to be demolished by a good bot
2011-02-09T22:42:40  <Prillicy> who would build an AI for a scenario that simply couldn't happen
2011-02-09T22:42:42  <antimatroid1> and when ants spawn near each other, that might be common
2011-02-09T22:43:01  <antimatroid1> Prillicy: not really
2011-02-09T22:43:06  <antimatroid1> it does make some sense
2011-02-09T22:43:18  <Prillicy> explain the realism then
2011-02-09T22:43:23  <antimatroid1> each ant goes for it's closest enemy, conveniently in a cyclic manner if necessary
2011-02-09T22:43:31  <antimatroid1> closest ants fight first
2011-02-09T22:43:37  <antimatroid1> as they "reach" each other first
2011-02-09T22:43:41  <jmcarthur> it makes sense if ants are like bombs
2011-02-09T22:43:55  <Prillicy> 1 ant versus 4
2011-02-09T22:43:57  <Prillicy> 4 wins
2011-02-09T22:43:57  <j3camero> So say we're the two players who are left. You're evenly spread out, whereas I have more ants near the front than far from it. I take 5% of the map from you, and you're only able to match my strength in that area a few moments later. I win.
2011-02-09T22:44:08  <antimatroid1> Prillicy: good point
2011-02-09T22:44:16  <jmcarthur> j3camero: no, i'm able to match your strength immediately
2011-02-09T22:44:23  <antimatroid1> go with jmcarthur's bombs
2011-02-09T22:44:23  <jmcarthur> j3camero: because i don't need as many ants to kill you
2011-02-09T22:44:41  <Prillicy> I think I see the idea now
2011-02-09T22:44:46  <janzert> and if you're only concentrated at the front it means your growth will be slower than mine
2011-02-09T22:44:52  <janzert> hence I can reinforce faster
2011-02-09T22:45:09  <Prillicy> you're saying groups of ants sending out ant defenses like countermeasures on an aircraft
2011-02-09T22:45:18  <antimatroid1> and if you manage to impede on them, you'll start taking out chunks
2011-02-09T22:45:20  <Prillicy> individual ants sent away from the group to defend
2011-02-09T22:45:23  <j3camero> jmcarthur: no, because I'm not attacking with a bare rectangle of ants. I'm just attacking with more ants than you have in the area.
2011-02-09T22:45:33  <Prillicy> it's an interesting idea and it would work with option 1 as much as option 2
2011-02-09T22:45:37  <antimatroid1> j3camero: you don't want to do that
2011-02-09T22:45:59  <antimatroid1> you want to fight with less ants and be able to get more ants there before the battle ends
2011-02-09T22:46:13  <jmcarthur> j3camero: you can't use all those ants at once. it doesn't help at all
2011-02-09T22:46:24  <antimatroid1> option 1 would be better for that person
2011-02-09T22:46:36  <jmcarthur> j3camero: by the time you have been able to strategically use your ants, i've been able to stream enough ants in in the first place
2011-02-09T22:46:38  <antimatroid1> but even then it's a balancing act of taking them out vs them growing faster
2011-02-09T22:46:44  <jmcarthur> j3camero: because you can only use a couple at a time
2011-02-09T22:46:47  <Prillicy> tightly grouped ants hurts the possibility of getting food, this is the reason to spread
2011-02-09T22:47:02  <antimatroid1> you could ensure no regions can be blocked i think
2011-02-09T22:47:07  <jmcarthur> j3camero: so the combat situation favors neither of us, but the food situation favors me
2011-02-09T22:47:10  <Prillicy> one enemy ant could kill 5 of your ants if positioned correctly, this is a reason to spread.
2011-02-09T22:47:12  <antimatroid1> just ensure there is no
2011-02-09T22:47:13  <antimatroid1> %.
2011-02-09T22:47:13  <antimatroid1> %% things
2011-02-09T22:47:30  <jmcarthur> j3camero: and the combat situation favors *me* if you don't attack with just one or two at a time
2011-02-09T22:47:36  <Prillicy> one enemy ant could kill one of your ants, this is a reason to stay close
2011-02-09T22:48:04  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: huh?
2011-02-09T22:48:07  <j3camero> There is a tradeoff between how quickly you pounce on food that is within your territory, vs how quickly you are able to act at the front line. It's how many of your ants you have at the front vs foraging.
2011-02-09T22:48:40  <antimatroid1> j3camero; there's also going to be ants in all directions, if you're the last two left, and spaced, you come in from every direction on them
2011-02-09T22:48:47  <antimatroid1> kamakazeeing them, that's going to annialiate them
2011-02-09T22:48:55  <Prillicy> except that your front is severely hurt if one ant gets to it and the ants aren't perfectly positioned to avoid multi-death
2011-02-09T22:49:10  <jmcarthur> j3camero: okay, this is simple math here. if you have 20 ants at the front, and i have 5 ants at the front, 5 ants a bit further back, 5 ants a bit further back, and 5 ants a bit further back, i'm able to fend you off while i stream in my ants because you can't attack all at once. meanwhile, as i'm streaming them in, i'm getting more food.
2011-02-09T22:49:27  <Prillicy> and with constantly shifting fronts, that nearly destroys any chance for a beginner to develop a strategy
2011-02-09T22:49:47  <Prillicy> instead they'll be trying to program avoiding multi-death for the 2 months or whatever length the competition is
2011-02-09T22:49:57  <j3camero> jmcarthur: I'm not saying don't forage and just keep all ants at the front, clearly.
2011-02-09T22:50:10  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i'm saying there's not *point* in keeping them at the front
2011-02-09T22:50:13  <jmcarthur> *no
2011-02-09T22:50:26  <Prillicy> I don't see the point
2011-02-09T22:50:27  <j3camero> jmcarthur: if I manage to push you back for a short time, I have more territory on which to collect food.
2011-02-09T22:50:29  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i'm saying that having more ants at the front doesn't enable you to respond more quickly
2011-02-09T22:50:36  <antimatroid1> fighting is reduced to keep a constant stream available with option 2
2011-02-09T22:50:51  <jmcarthur> j3camero: it also doesn't give you more power to push with
2011-02-09T22:50:54  <antimatroid1> which provides no balance to the spreading out
2011-02-09T22:50:59  <jmcarthur> j3camero: you can still only attack with a couple at a time
2011-02-09T22:51:09  <jmcarthur> j3camero: and i only have to stream them in at the same speed
2011-02-09T22:51:17  <jmcarthur> i could easily hold your ants at bay
2011-02-09T22:51:23  <jmcarthur> *at the same rate
2011-02-09T22:51:35  <Prillicy> plus, without ants grouped together, he would have more ants coming in as more are foraging
2011-02-09T22:51:42  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-02-09T22:52:13  <jmcarthur> not that that even helps
2011-02-09T22:52:20  <jmcarthur> unless that's where score comes from
2011-02-09T22:52:28  <j3camero> Except that while this is all happening, I have more territory.
2011-02-09T22:52:34  <Prillicy> you wouldn't
2011-02-09T22:52:36  <Prillicy> you're more compact
2011-02-09T22:52:41  <jmcarthur> territory means nothing if your ants aren't on it
2011-02-09T22:52:44  <Prillicy> with the same number of ants, he would have more territory
2011-02-09T22:52:46  <antimatroid1> more spaced means you have more area
2011-02-09T22:53:09  <antimatroid1> there will ideally be lots of paths to most places too
2011-02-09T22:53:20  <antimatroid1> so if they're blocking you, go around and attack from behind
2011-02-09T22:53:45  <jmcarthur> i'm tempted to just say we should code the engine and then j3camero can make a bot that clumps together and somebody else can make one that spread out, then we'll see once and for which one annhilates the other
2011-02-09T22:53:47  <janzert> right, maybe that's the key. territory in this case is not the places you can reach first, it's the places you are in now
2011-02-09T22:54:08  <Prillicy> I think you're worrying too much about "beginners" when that's the contestant selector program's job
2011-02-09T22:54:17  <janzert> the squares where food turns into your ants that is
2011-02-09T22:55:16  <jmcarthur> it's not like combat resolution would be difficult to change after we finally show j3camero how bad this one is
2011-02-09T22:55:32  <Frontier_> i think it is sufficient to see the food. if you aren't on it that only means a short delay to get there. the food doesn't decay. It is all yours as long as it is on your territory
2011-02-09T22:55:32  <j3camero> Maybe I'm not understand you. You're saying that the optimal strategy with option 2 is to just spread out to coat your territory with a uniform distribution of ants?
2011-02-09T22:55:38  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: the problem is with how late we realise it needs changing
2011-02-09T22:55:39  <jmcarthur> j3camero: exactly
2011-02-09T22:55:52  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: part of my proposal is to code some bots before the contest starts
2011-02-09T22:55:59  <janzert> j3camero: yes
2011-02-09T22:56:09  <antimatroid1> yes i plan to as well, i have been working on my own "super starter bot"
2011-02-09T22:56:10  <jmcarthur> j3camero: and there's really nothing that will beat that
2011-02-09T22:56:31  <antimatroid1> it has no strategy yet, it's all just tools
2011-02-09T22:57:13  <j3camero> jmcarthur: clearly not. I mean, come on. If there are two players left, all I have to do is push you back just a tiny bit, and I will now have 51% of the territory. If there are two even players left, the situation is inherently unstable. It will quickly break in favor of one player or the other. The way to make it break in your favor is to push just a little harder than the other guy at the front line by having just a slightly higher density of ants at
2011-02-09T22:57:13  <antimatroid1> can i also point out option 1 is cheaper to compute
2011-02-09T22:57:21  <jmcarthur> j3camero: what do you push with?
2011-02-09T22:57:34  <antimatroid1> j3camero: that sounds like a very slow game
2011-02-09T22:57:42  <jmcarthur> j3camero: you're going to push my one ant with, well, one ant at a time, right?
2011-02-09T22:57:45  <antimatroid1> 2 people left, slowly battling away single ants at a time
2011-02-09T22:57:57  <jmcarthur> j3camero: meanwhile, i can just stream the ants in
2011-02-09T22:58:07  <jmcarthur> j3camero: there's no benefit to having them clumped up at the front
2011-02-09T22:58:25  <jmcarthur> j3camero: and since you don't have as many ants throughout the rest of your territory, you're not generating as many ants
2011-02-09T22:58:34  <antimatroid1> as you get more ants that you've filled your region, you would fill the front lines from a distance anyway
2011-02-09T22:58:58  <j3camero> Yeah, so my first ant and your first ant kill each other, but then I have a second ant directly behind and you don't. Therefore I am able to collect food in the area more readily than you.
2011-02-09T22:59:04  <antimatroid1> it's fairly boring macro wise as opposed to how people must deal with 1, which means it's more interesting with micro and macro?
2011-02-09T22:59:14  <jmcarthur> j3camero: if it's directly behind, it dies. if it's a safe distance behind, well, i have one too
2011-02-09T22:59:15  <Prillicy> j3camero: option 2 presents a clear simple optimizing strategy...which I believe is one of the first things you said shouldn't be in the game
2011-02-09T22:59:18  <jmcarthur> j3camero: no advantage
2011-02-09T22:59:37  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: abb -> ..b
2011-02-09T22:59:52  <j3camero> Wait, why does my second ant die?
2011-02-09T22:59:57  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: all i have to do is let him chase one of my ants a couple pixels in and come from the side
2011-02-09T22:59:58  <j3camero> It's behind, not beside.
2011-02-09T23:00:09  <jmcarthur> it's a trivial move
2011-02-09T23:00:13  <antimatroid1> aaa  a.a
2011-02-09T23:00:13  <antimatroid1> .b.   ... unless with chebyshev
2011-02-09T23:00:22  <antimatroid1> j3camero has a point
2011-02-09T23:00:26  <Prillicy> j3camero: the optimizing strategy is to keep ants at visible distance of each other, searching their vision for food and enemies.  When one ant goes out of visual range (having prioritized either food or fight) the ant that doesn't see it anymore should follow
2011-02-09T23:00:31  <j3camero> If you let me chase you back a few pixels, I win.
2011-02-09T23:00:48  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: or unless with the sqrt(5) range
2011-02-09T23:01:03  <antimatroid1> j3camero: i don't think it lets you win, but it gives you something i didn't think before
2011-02-09T23:01:14  <jmcarthur> j3camero: that's not the case because you then immediately lose those ants you ran in with
2011-02-09T23:01:19  <Prillicy> this creates a perfect funnel to enemy ants avoiding possible multi-kills and finds as much food as possible
2011-02-09T23:01:30  <antimatroid1> the spread out bot is going to be growing faster
2011-02-09T23:01:43  <antimatroid1> and have a larger region
2011-02-09T23:02:23  <Prillicy> j3camero: you're assuming your massive group of ants isn't getting hit with multi-kills left and right as well, which is going to happen as people would develop strategies to find ways to get the most kills with individual ants
2011-02-09T23:02:26  <j3camero> Here's the counter-example. Picture a 1xN map which is just a thin rectangle. Two players start wth the same number of ants int he same configuration. If you spread evenly, all I have to do is keep, say, 3 ants lined up at the front with the rest spread evenly otherwise, and march steadily towards you. It almost can't lose.
2011-02-09T23:02:40  <jmcarthur> j3camero: ant worst, i just need a single file line. i still don't need a huge clump of ants
2011-02-09T23:02:54  <jmcarthur> *at worst
2011-02-09T23:03:16  <jmcarthur> huh?
2011-02-09T23:03:23  <jmcarthur> j3camero: why would that favor either player at all?
2011-02-09T23:03:25  <antimatroid1> yes it can
2011-02-09T23:03:41  <antimatroid1> if you have groups of 3, then you pretty much can't lose?
2011-02-09T23:03:54  <antimatroid1> but it's a simple strategy for both to work out
2011-02-09T23:03:55  <j3camero> Because my first ant kills your first ant, then I have another immediately ready to hold the gains and you don't.
2011-02-09T23:04:24  <jmcarthur> okay fine, but this still doesn't counter against my single file line
2011-02-09T23:04:27  <jmcarthur> i don't need a clump
2011-02-09T23:04:46  <jmcarthur> it's still effectively the same thing
2011-02-09T23:04:48  <antimatroid1> aabb -> .... in option 1
2011-02-09T23:04:48  <antimatroid1> a..b in option 2
2011-02-09T23:04:52  <j3camero> It's still not an even spread, as I understand it.
2011-02-09T23:04:55  <antimatroid1> you just need to go around with pairs if possible
2011-02-09T23:05:10  <Prillicy> no, he's right
2011-02-09T23:05:17  <Prillicy> as I said, the fight is the encouragement to stay together
2011-02-09T23:05:18  <Prillicy> I agree
2011-02-09T23:05:28  <Prillicy> but the multi-kill is DISCOURAGING that
2011-02-09T23:05:33  <jmcarthur> i also still don't see it as very compelling
2011-02-09T23:05:37  <janzert> j3camero: we won't meet in the middle though we'll meet on your half since you had to put that clump together and spread slower
2011-02-09T23:06:40  <Prillicy> janzert has a point
2011-02-09T23:06:44  <janzert> just start with one ant on either 2/3rds point and go from there
2011-02-09T23:06:57  <Prillicy> more than that, where are all these ants coming from on a 1xN map? there can only be food on the straight line
2011-02-09T23:07:19  <Prillicy> which means the spreader would have more ants anyway
2011-02-09T23:07:44  <antimatroid1> would it depend on the rate of food?
2011-02-09T23:07:51  <jmcarthur> somewhat
2011-02-09T23:07:56  <antimatroid1> if it's too slow, then j3camero wins
2011-02-09T23:08:06  <Prillicy> incorrect
2011-02-09T23:08:09  <antimatroid1> hmmm
2011-02-09T23:08:22  <Prillicy> you're still forgetting that j3camero is going to lose 3 ants to your 1
2011-02-09T23:08:22  <j3camero> So at first your forward-most ants run right to the front, while the rest spread out. Then we meet in the middle. After that first meeting, I have an ant closer to the middle than you. After the second battle, I still have an ant closer to the middle than you. I will always. The only sacrifice I'm making is to be slightly slower to pick up food far from the front line.
2011-02-09T23:08:31  <Prillicy> so he needs to have 3x your ants to beat you
2011-02-09T23:08:31  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: nono, he won't in this case
2011-02-09T23:08:43  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: aaab  =>  aa..
2011-02-09T23:08:54  <Prillicy> in a single line map?  it won't matter, the food the map started with will result in the spreader having more ants
2011-02-09T23:09:06  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: well, that's what antimatroid1 was talking about
2011-02-09T23:09:14  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: the rate of food spawning has an effect here
2011-02-09T23:09:21  <antimatroid1> you just don't want to do a.b.a
2011-02-09T23:09:23  <Prillicy> not necessarily
2011-02-09T23:09:36  <antimatroid1> that would hurt :P
2011-02-09T23:09:43  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: e.g. if it was only one food every fifteen turns
2011-02-09T23:09:49  <j3camero> Yes it's true that the rate of food spawning increases the choice you make on the tradeoff between foraging and pushing.
2011-02-09T23:10:00  <Prillicy> you're thinking backward
2011-02-09T23:10:11  <jmcarthur> huh?
2011-02-09T23:10:22  <Prillicy> the rate of food spawning does help a user make the decision whether to group or spread
2011-02-09T23:10:31  <j3camero> In any realistic scenario here, where food is relatively sparse, I can sacrific just a few foraging ants to gain a steady upper hand at the front.
2011-02-09T23:10:33  <Prillicy> that doesn't change the fact that option two encourages a user to spread
2011-02-09T23:10:45  <jmcarthur> on a finite map it does affect your decision
2011-02-09T23:10:47  <Prillicy> food is the reason to spread
2011-02-09T23:10:49  <antimatroid1> breaking down fronts like this will be slow and boring
2011-02-09T23:10:49  <jmcarthur> okay yes
2011-02-09T23:10:52  <jmcarthur> i agree there
2011-02-09T23:10:54  <Prillicy> enemies is the reason to group
2011-02-09T23:11:02  <jmcarthur> i agree that option 2 and food both encourage spreading out
2011-02-09T23:11:03  <Prillicy> if you add a second reason to spread: option 2
2011-02-09T23:11:08  <Prillicy> what's your second reason to group
2011-02-09T23:11:10  <Prillicy> ?
2011-02-09T23:11:20  <jmcarthur> i'd rather the two be conflicting motivators
2011-02-09T23:11:25  <Prillicy> this should be an even conflict
2011-02-09T23:11:59  <Prillicy> if your second reason to group is lowering the food rate, the reality is you're simply removing the 1st reason to spread
2011-02-09T23:12:28  <Prillicy> if you truly want to encourage varying strategies
2011-02-09T23:12:32  <Prillicy> randomize the food growth rate
2011-02-09T23:12:42  <Prillicy> don't add something so obvious to destroy beginners like option 2
2011-02-09T23:12:52  <jmcarthur> Prillicy is speaking more clearly than anybody else
