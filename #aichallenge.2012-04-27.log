2012-04-27T14:55:44  <mleise> no
2012-04-27T14:55:56  <mcstar> apparently there is an internet meme, where ppl drop the 'base' the ph>4.5 liquid, and it is supposed to be funny
2012-04-27T14:56:02  <mcstar> i think it has to do with music
2012-04-27T14:56:06  <mcstar> drum and base
2012-04-27T14:56:10  <Zannick> bass
2012-04-27T14:56:10  <mcstar> bass
2012-04-27T14:56:14  <mcstar> whatever
2012-04-27T14:56:27  <mcstar> Zannick: can you explain?
2012-04-27T14:56:33  <mleise> ok, funny :-|
2012-04-27T14:56:37  <mleise> :D
2012-04-27T14:57:03  <Zannick> "dropping the bass" is a term for a particular thing that happens in dubstep or brostep
2012-04-27T14:57:17  <rwest> it's also a term for pooping
2012-04-27T14:57:22  <mcstar> meaning the cut  it out?
2012-04-27T14:57:27  <mcstar> the->they
2012-04-27T14:57:34  <Zannick> basically right after a break in the music all the music comes back in suddenly with the bass on full
2012-04-27T14:57:55  <mcstar> ok, so dropping the base, is when it comes back
2012-04-27T14:57:57  <mcstar> thanks
2012-04-27T14:58:22  <Zannick> dropping the bass
2012-04-27T14:58:47  <mcstar> i feel like a total idiot
2012-04-27T14:59:12  <mcstar> why is this funny? and saying base instead if bass?
2012-04-27T14:59:25  <mcstar> base doesnt sound like bass at all
2012-04-27T14:59:59  <Zannick> they are pronounced the same
2012-04-27T15:00:12  <rwest> mcstar: welcome to english lol

2012-04-27T15:00:46  <mcstar> isnt the fish brass?
2012-04-27T15:00:55  <rwest> no it's bass

2012-04-27T15:01:54  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-27T15:02:02  <mcstar> i was just confused for a moment
2012-04-27T15:02:34  <mcstar> ok, my misunderstanding comes from not knowing the pronunciation of 'bass'
2012-04-27T15:03:51  <mcstar> damn, i love these moments of truth

2012-04-27T15:04:44  <mleise> so the instrument is spelled 'base' ??!?!?!?!? Oo
2012-04-27T15:04:48  <mcstar> yes
2012-04-27T15:04:51  <mleise> wtf?
2012-04-27T15:04:55  <mcstar> not spelled
2012-04-27T15:04:56  <mleise> why noone told me
2012-04-27T15:05:01  <mleise> pronouinced
2012-04-27T15:05:06  <mcstar> almost
2012-04-27T15:05:09  <mleise> lol
2012-04-27T15:05:12  <mleise> dont be nitpicky
2012-04-27T15:06:26  <mleise> fuck, they are right. i just checked the pronunciation on leo.org

2012-04-27T15:07:29  <mcstar> in hungarian, bass is 'basszus' which is said like 'bar' not 'beige'
2012-04-27T15:14:08  <antimatroid> that was an interesting conversation to read as a native english speaker :P
2012-04-27T15:15:37  <Zannick> haha
2012-04-27T15:15:44  <rwest> english really has a lot of dumb shit in it

2012-04-27T15:20:36  <rwest> Ok this is going to sound bad, but we don't need to, you speak english
2012-04-27T15:20:38  <mcstar> i was just making a joke, but you seem to think an different level..
2012-04-27T15:20:42  <rwest> :)

2012-04-27T15:21:33  <mcstar> mleise: do ppl tell you often "leave me alon!", "ill get a restricition order!" or similar things?
2012-04-27T15:21:55  <mleise> what is a restriction order?
2012-04-27T15:22:05  <rwest> restraining
2012-04-27T15:22:09  <mcstar> ahah
2012-04-27T15:22:12  <mcstar> fuck
2012-04-27T15:22:48  <mcstar> i decided this morning ill speak more hungarian, seems it has a negative effect on my english
2012-04-27T15:26:52  <antimatroid> i do wish english had better structure

2012-04-27T15:30:58  <mcstar> aham, so this is what machine learning is about
2012-04-27T15:32:07  <mcstar> re english: i wish i had a better memory, i can hardly memorize words that i dont use often
2012-04-27T15:33:12  <mcstar> i find it a nice language, basically i watch everything in english, and the overwhelming part of what i read is in english too
2012-04-27T15:33:21  <mcstar> it t be*
2012-04-27T15:36:03  <mcstar> andrew ng says 'ass' instead of 'ask', thats a sizeable mistake
2012-04-27T15:42:56  <mcstar> i dont like the idea of using octave for machine learning, python would have been just fine
2012-04-27T15:43:34  <HaraKiri> im doing that machine learning thing too
2012-04-27T15:43:52  <HaraKiri> and agree that octave is awkward for it :x
2012-04-27T15:44:18  <mcstar> HaraKiri: Ng even says that 'you cant do this in one line in python'
2012-04-27T15:44:25  <mcstar> the svd example
2012-04-27T15:44:52  <mcstar> it would be indeed a bit more verbose in c++ or java, but not in python
2012-04-27T15:45:15  <rwest> lisp gogo
2012-04-27T15:45:16  <HaraKiri> yeah python would have been my choice too. also the subtitles are hilarious
2012-04-27T15:45:26  <mcstar> i dont use them
2012-04-27T15:45:51  <HaraKiri> i tried them, but theyre super wrong, although it has been explicitly said that it's not a machine translation :D
2012-04-27T15:46:02  <mcstar> :)
2012-04-27T15:48:27  <mcstar> i had to use matlab on some courses at uni, and i developed an aversion from it, and its derivatives
2012-04-27T15:49:35  <HaraKiri> too bad. but will you stick with it though?
2012-04-27T15:49:48  <mcstar> do i need to?
2012-04-27T15:50:01  <HaraKiri> well submissions are octave only afaik
2012-04-27T15:50:15  <mcstar> they need to code or just the answers?
2012-04-27T15:51:20  <mcstar> i just really dont want to get used to another 'language' right now, even if octave is simple
2012-04-27T15:51:32  <mcstar> i have no other use for it than this course
2012-04-27T15:51:48  <HaraKiri> the whole submission function is an octave file, so that'll be tricky to avoid
2012-04-27T15:52:07  <HaraKiri> if they only check the result, and you have a look at that file, maybe you can fake it
2012-04-27T15:52:11  <mcstar> well, ill just swallow it then
2012-04-27T15:52:51  <mleise> D
2012-04-27T15:53:10  <mleise> oh wait, machine learning? meh...
2012-04-27T15:54:20  <mcstar> mleise: come on, you cant suggest D in place of octave
2012-04-27T15:54:57  <mcstar> Ng has a perfectly valid point, why he teaches with octave
2012-04-27T15:55:20  <mcstar> my problem is, that you could do most or almost everything with the same flexibility in python
2012-04-27T15:55:27  <mcstar> and python is general purpose
2012-04-27T15:55:44  <mleise> yep, Python is very powerful
2012-04-27T15:55:47  <mcstar> (and no, dont tell me ppl wrote Ants submissions in octave i wont listen)
2012-04-27T15:56:05  <mleise> haha, didn't see octave on the supported languages list
