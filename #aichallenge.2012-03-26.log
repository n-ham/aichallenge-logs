2012-03-26T09:41:31  <lorill> i just did a bot slightly better than the sample one
2012-03-26T09:41:36  <lorill> the games are short
2012-03-26T09:41:51  <lorill> i like the idea, but doing a visualizer will be a bit hard i guess
2012-03-26T09:46:22  <smiley1983> lorill: yes, I think the visualizer would take some work to make it any good
2012-03-26T09:47:42  <smiley1983> also, adding the grouping of territories for bonuses will be easy, I just haven't done it because I couldn't think of a simple way to visualize it (I now think I can just add a colored mark inside the territory to indicate its group)
2012-03-26T09:48:56  <lorill> there are a few bugs, but i'm not sure if it's worth investigating if we don't know if the game will be selected
2012-03-26T09:49:30  <lorill> for example, it looks like i have the same number of troops to deploy, no matter how many territories i have
2012-03-26T09:49:59  <lorill> I suppose it misses a multiplier somewhere, since i sometimes have 5001 or 5002 to deploy from what i've seen
2012-03-26T09:50:55  <smiley1983> Yes, I admit I haven't really looked at the replays much to ensure correctness. I just opened issue tracking on the github page: https://github.com/smiley1983/aichallenge/tree/war

2012-03-26T09:53:09  <smiley1983> However, it may be better to wait a few days by which time I will probably have gone over the code again a few times.
2012-03-26T09:53:34  <lorill> ok. I'll check for updates in the forum then
2012-03-26T09:55:00  <smiley1983> I'll try to remember to post there :)
2012-03-26T10:01:37  <antimatroid> is this for risk?
2012-03-26T10:01:41  <antimatroid> i just don't see it being fun to watch
2012-03-26T10:01:52  <antimatroid> past games have always been reasonably exciting to watch
2012-03-26T10:05:23  <smiley1983> yes, that's why I found Asteroids more appealing initially
2012-03-26T10:05:47  <antimatroid> initially?
2012-03-26T10:05:52  <smiley1983> though I think Risk on huge maps could be interesting to watch, just less so
2012-03-26T10:06:25  <smiley1983> yes, I think it's less accessible to beginners than previous contests
2012-03-26T10:06:28  <antimatroid> i still asteroids is a go
2012-03-26T10:06:42  <antimatroid> i accidentally a think
2012-03-26T10:06:52  <smiley1983> I still like the idea very much, and would be happy to see it go ahead :)
2012-03-26T10:07:13  <antimatroid> if i had time ms pacman sounds awesome
2012-03-26T10:07:15  <delt0r> aren't we kinda waiting on sorting things out with jeff?
2012-03-26T10:07:19  <antimatroid> the java part not so much
2012-03-26T10:07:24  <lorill> my guess would be that both would work
2012-03-26T10:07:36  <delt0r> I was going to sink some time into mplayer asteroids.
2012-03-26T10:08:13  <antimatroid> how are collisions detected with asteroids?
2012-03-26T10:08:30  <smiley1983> If we wait for the organizational stuff to be sorted out before we begin, it'll never happen :)
2012-03-26T10:08:40  <delt0r> smiley1983: true
2012-03-26T10:08:43  <antimatroid> not necessarily
2012-03-26T10:08:54  <delt0r> well there is already some kind of version that i didn't look at...
2012-03-26T10:08:58  <antimatroid> if we got a plan together we could perhaps go to jeff and say are you in or can we do this without you
2012-03-26T10:09:13  <delt0r> thing is i already have a integer based "space" engine anyway
2012-03-26T10:09:28  <smiley1983> simple radius check after single step, regardless of speeds. Needs changing to something better.
2012-03-26T10:09:40  <delt0r> antimatroid: i get the impression that it is always no...
2012-03-26T10:10:09  <antimatroid> i don't think we've ever pushed very hard
2012-03-26T10:10:17  <delt0r> smiley1983: that is fine, just have more "game frames" per game turn
2012-03-26T10:10:19  <antimatroid> i could be wrong
2012-03-26T10:10:30  <delt0r> it works really well
2012-03-26T10:11:00  <smiley1983> But do we have a fixed number and a speed cap, or scale the number of frames to the speed of the fastest objects?
2012-03-26T10:11:20  <delt0r> smiley1983: speed cap always... always have sanity on values
2012-03-26T10:11:33  <delt0r> then a fix number of steps per turn
2012-03-26T10:11:40  <smiley1983> yes, that makes sense
2012-03-26T10:12:03  <delt0r> turns out to be quite fast as well
2012-03-26T10:12:05  <smiley1983> quite easy to implement
2012-03-26T10:12:52  *** Areks <Areks!~Areks@rs.gridnine.com> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2012-03-26T10:13:08  <smiley1983> delt0r: is your integer based space engine open source?
2012-03-26T10:13:09  <antimatroid> would it be very hard to make it into more of a car game?
2012-03-26T10:13:23  <antimatroid> instead of asteroids have a fixed course where you drive around trying to shoot each other?
2012-03-26T10:13:51  <smiley1983> no, I think that just means adding traction, and more of it when moving sideways
2012-03-26T10:13:57  <delt0r> antimatroid: yea... since for cars you want quite a detailed physics model.. otherwise its a bit trivial
2012-03-26T10:14:13  <delt0r> smiley1983: more or less... not offically release at any point
2012-03-26T10:14:41  <delt0r> never finished it, it was a competing idea to ants.. but once i realized i wasn't going to displace ants i moved on
2012-03-26T10:14:50  <delt0r> but the core engine is there
2012-03-26T10:15:05  <delt0r> it was for a "space squad combat" game.
2012-03-26T10:15:11  <delt0r> rts style
2012-03-26T10:15:47  <aerique> delt0r: weren't you turning it into something commercial?
2012-03-26T10:15:50  <delt0r> "space" means some value of cartoon/holywood space physics, not real physics
2012-03-26T10:16:06  <delt0r> aerique: yea i am. but that game is quite different now
2012-03-26T10:16:17  <delt0r> to complicated for a comp like this
2012-03-26T10:16:39  <delt0r> also it have a full opengl rendering pipeline
2012-03-26T10:17:03  <delt0r> which i think is not needed for this... or at least will add too much debug overhead
2012-03-26T10:17:44  <delt0r> aerique: also making a commercial game seems to be an exercise in a non terminating loop
2012-03-26T10:17:51  <delt0r> at least at the indie level
2012-03-26T10:18:18  <smiley1983> I like the idea of an asteroids game where you can't shoot each other directly, but the smallest asteroids are indestructible, so you have to direct them toward the enemies with your shots (and multiple ships per player)
2012-03-26T10:18:20  <aerique> any screenshots / media?
2012-03-26T10:18:44  <delt0r> aerique: not really
2012-03-26T10:18:57  <delt0r> badly rendered nebular and a few models
2012-03-26T10:19:08  <delt0r> i am only just finishing the logic
2012-03-26T10:19:17  <delt0r> right now its gui...
2012-03-26T10:19:21  <delt0r> i hate gui
2012-03-26T10:19:28  <aerique> good luck then :-)
2012-03-26T10:19:39  <delt0r> smiley1983: i think shooting each other is also cool.
2012-03-26T10:19:51  <delt0r> aerique: yea... luck ..what is that again...
2012-03-26T10:20:10  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i think that's getting too complicated :P
2012-03-26T10:20:19  <delt0r> well that is not the problem. The problem is that you just keep adding stuff and making things better, rather than just getting it finished
2012-03-26T10:20:27  <antimatroid> from the games i watched on the tcp server the firing range isn't very big?
2012-03-26T10:20:53  <antimatroid> i think it would be good if good bots varied at least a bit with their speed
2012-03-26T10:20:58  <antimatroid> duking it out
2012-03-26T10:21:00  <delt0r> what i like about asteroids is the simple control. turn left, turn right, thrust
2012-03-26T10:21:03  <smiley1983> currently set to 12 turns (meaning the bullet actually lives for 11)
2012-03-26T10:21:26  <antimatroid> i like the idea of trying to throw optimal control theory at it
2012-03-26T10:21:50  <smiley1983> delt0r: current implementation takes a float for your turn and thrust values
2012-03-26T10:21:54  <delt0r> antimatroid: well for some of this it has been done. I don't like that so much
2012-03-26T10:21:58  <aerique> purely cosmetic but i liked to looks of my initial prototype better (classic asteroids ship with hit bubble also shown)
2012-03-26T10:22:10  <delt0r> smiley1983: yea current version is a floating point one
2012-03-26T10:22:32  <delt0r> which i think is fine.. but many don't like the idea of floats so much
2012-03-26T10:22:46  <smiley1983> aerique: I never got that one to work for me
2012-03-26T10:22:55  <smiley1983> probably something to do with my setup
2012-03-26T10:22:59  <delt0r> aerique: right --i was assuming that is what got put up live
2012-03-26T10:23:03  <delt0r> its not your one?
2012-03-26T10:23:13  <aerique> smiley1983: yeah no problem, it was kinda typical :-)
2012-03-26T10:23:58  <aerique> or, well, the engine shouldn't have been a problem but the visualizer... yeah
2012-03-26T10:24:22  <smiley1983> I agree that the current javascript visualizer is not the prettiest :)
2012-03-26T10:24:23  <delt0r> i like the idea of Shields and more than one ship per player
