2011-06-22T05:16:46  <Naktibalda> new firefox again?
2011-06-22T05:17:13  <mleise> yes no? is the canvas image shadow bug fixed?
2011-06-22T05:17:35  <mleise> has noone upgraded? is everyone using other browsers?
2011-06-22T05:17:42  <Rabidus> chrome
2011-06-22T05:18:03  * Naktibalda has 4 browsers openned :)
2011-06-22T05:18:17  <Naktibalda> err no, safari is closed, I don't need it
2011-06-22T05:18:55  <mleise> I got an email from my free email service, advertising firefox 5 - roughly translated to english: "smart as a fox, fast as firefox 5"
2011-06-22T05:20:06  <mleise> with special emphasize on the speed improvement due to "special modifications on the so-called JavaScript and canvas elements"
2011-06-22T05:20:24  <antimatroid> ie team sent them a cake
2011-06-22T05:20:56  <mleise> now if they bought that speedup by making the canvas unusable it makes me mad ... a bit
2011-06-22T05:21:21  <antimatroid> ask them?
2011-06-22T05:21:25  <antimatroid> surely they have an irc channel
2011-06-22T05:22:01  <antimatroid> that they do
2011-06-22T05:22:25  <mleise> no I'll download that Â§$&"&)" and try myself :p
2011-06-22T05:23:38  <mleise> *doh* they released with the bug
2011-06-22T05:25:17  <mcstar> the cake is a lie
2011-06-22T05:25:27  <antimatroid> mleise: how nice of them :(
2011-06-22T05:28:32  <mleise> ok now that the visualizer is barely usable in FF 5 what do you think I should do?
2011-06-22T05:29:13  <mleise> provide a work-around for ff5 until the bug is fixed or just wait for the bugfix
2011-06-22T05:29:33  <mleise> (the bug is in their bugzilla already)
2011-06-22T05:30:25  <aerique> unless the work-around won't take much time i'd just wait for the bugfix
2011-06-22T05:32:58  <mcstar> mleise: with this reasoning ("i cant use my latest software, doh") many of could say, that the whole contest is f'ed, cause it runs on out-of-date ubuntu
2011-06-22T05:33:31  <mcstar> us left us out
2011-06-22T05:34:29  <antimatroid> mcstar: there is a different between what stuff runs on the server and what people can do locally
2011-06-22T05:34:47  <antimatroid> mleise: i dunno, i'm amazed they would release something with a known bug
2011-06-22T05:34:56  <antimatroid> is it likely to screw many developers over?
2011-06-22T05:35:14  <mcstar> you have to write your program so that it runs the same on the server, languages and impementations change
2011-06-22T05:35:29  <mcstar> it isnt different
2011-06-22T05:36:32  <mleise> antimatroid: the bug is in a feature neither ie nor chrome support, so it is quite possible that few developers make use of it.
2011-06-22T05:36:48  <mcstar> take a look at the ifpc contest or what the f ever that was called: they supported only a specific version of debian with strict package selection
2011-06-22T05:36:48  <antimatroid> mleise: it's still really poor on their part imo
2011-06-22T05:37:03  <antimatroid> they're knowingly causing a fair bit of grief to anyone who does use it and needs to care about what their users think
2011-06-22T05:37:12  <mleise> antimatroid: yes, especially since it is a regression that an automated test case would have catched
2011-06-22T05:38:17  <antimatroid> i would question them about that decision personally, but i don't really know what the bug is?
2011-06-22T05:38:22  <mleise> then again it is an open-source project so i don't want to be that harsh
2011-06-22T05:39:05  <antimatroid> the still hold a fairly large market share in the browser market, they should care somewhat about the people who develop stuff to work with their browser
2011-06-22T05:39:13  <mleise> antimatroid: The bug is, if you render an image into the canvas with active drop shadow it now colorizes and blurs the whole image
2011-06-22T05:39:49  <mleise> so with the medium gray shadow I use the images look gray and blurry, like through dirty glass
2011-06-22T05:40:14  <antimatroid> is there an easy way to do it a different way?
2011-06-22T05:41:52  <mleise> i would have to create a shadow in some gfx software and change my button class to load two images. it's more work than I want to put into that bug. Disabling shadows altogether would be another option
2011-06-22T05:43:23  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-06-22T05:43:59  <antimatroid> mleise: i couldn't help myself and asked about it in #firefox, and now i have a question for you :P
2011-06-22T05:44:00  <antimatroid> "does the image come from cross domain?"
2011-06-22T05:46:14  <mleise> of course not :p
2011-06-22T05:46:54  <mleise> they ask the basic questions, that's ok. but once I find the bug in the bugzilla I tell you what the status is
2011-06-22T05:47:28  <mleise> cross-domain would be if i didn't load it from aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com
2011-06-22T05:47:49  <mleise> but all the files are local to that server
2011-06-22T05:55:14  <mleise> The bug status is RESOLVED FIXED, but I'm not sure in which version
2011-06-22T05:55:23  <mleise> ah ff6

2011-06-22T06:01:29  <antimatroid> it's winter, it's damn freezing!
2011-06-22T06:01:35  <Rabidus> winter? lol

2011-06-22T06:52:06  <Zaphus> hmm - some country codes don't quite work:  one says "Saint Barth&Atilde;ï¿½&Acirc;&copy;lemy"  :-)
2011-06-22T06:53:12  <george1914> Rabidus:  hi.  it anyway seemed yesterday that some more things needed doing to make the game engine run correctly ...    so i guess we need to wait a while before we have fully functioning tcp server ?
2011-06-22T06:58:00  <Rabidus> yes
2011-06-22T06:58:17  <Rabidus> it would be nice if i just could leave it running and forget it like that :)
2011-06-22T06:58:35  <Rabidus> now everything else starts lagging because it takes everything it can

2011-06-22T07:01:57  <george1914> thanks for running it though.
2011-06-22T07:01:59  <Zaphus> it really shouldnt use much CPU if it's coded right  - it can sleep waiting for the bots to respond
2011-06-22T07:02:07  <Zaphus> not that I could write one though :-)
2011-06-22T07:03:31  <george1914> tcp is almost the important part of the contest (apart from final results)  imo.    the place you really test your bot against others, and improve/debug it more easily than on official server
2011-06-22T07:05:00  <mcstar> mcleopold said its not hard to mod the official engine to add tcp support to the sandbox, berak might just do it

2011-06-22T07:13:06  <mcstar> george1914: sorry if i upset you
2011-06-22T07:13:10  <george1914> lisp is/was something i have looked at a few times, wondering about using/learning it ...
2011-06-22T07:13:14  <george1914> :)
2011-06-22T07:13:33  <george1914> though i have never encountered a lisp user
2011-06-22T07:13:36  <mcstar> wondering is bad, its wasted time: do or do not
2011-06-22T07:13:47  <mcstar> and i say do :D
2011-06-22T07:13:51  <george1914> no, no.  that leads to lots of wasted time
2011-06-22T07:13:56  <george1914> planning is important
2011-06-22T07:14:07  <mcstar> planning is for the weak
2011-06-22T07:14:15  <mcstar> no im kidding
2011-06-22T07:14:16  <george1914> you should see the wasted efforts i did in the last 2 contests, on clever plans that did not work
2011-06-22T07:14:34  <mcstar> im sure youre much wiser now
2011-06-22T07:14:35  <george1914> and maybe should not have started
2011-06-22T07:14:36  <Rabidus> planning takes just a week
2011-06-22T07:14:44  <george1914> :)
2011-06-22T07:14:55  <Rabidus> fuu, back to work
2011-06-22T07:14:55  <Rabidus> -<
2011-06-22T07:15:53  <george1914> mcstar:  so you have used lisp for the clever stuff? - modifying own code during running, etc?
2011-06-22T07:16:19  <mcstar> why would i want that?
2011-06-22T07:16:41  <mcstar> or maybe we arent talking about the same thing
2011-06-22T07:16:48  <mcstar> you mean the REPL or simply eval?
2011-06-22T07:17:05  <george1914> (i had a brief look at bocsimako's code from last contest - it seemed he used it just because he knows the language - he could have done the same thing in fortran, c++, or whatever)
2011-06-22T07:17:31  <mcstar> well, i guess the question is how comfortably
2011-06-22T07:17:36  <george1914> well, i thought the big deal in lisp was that you could manipule lisp code with lisp code  (easily)
2011-06-22T07:17:59  <mcstar> you can know the popular languages well, some things nevertheless will always look ugly
2011-06-22T07:18:07  <george1914> so potentially very powerful for AI
2011-06-22T07:18:08  <mcstar> lisp helps with those usually
2011-06-22T07:18:31  <mcstar> thats true, and its not just ai that it is powerful in
2011-06-22T07:18:40  <mcstar> but you should elaborate on your question
2011-06-22T07:18:45  <mcstar> the first one
2011-06-22T07:18:53  <mcstar>  modifying own code during running
2011-06-22T07:19:47  *** stocha <stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-22T07:19:59  <mcstar> still there?
2011-06-22T07:20:08  <stocha> hey guys i had this new crazy idea  bout how to make games shorter.
2011-06-22T07:20:16  <mcstar> stocha: very nice
2011-06-22T07:20:22  <stocha> yeah
2011-06-22T07:20:31  <mcstar> (but i havent even told it yet!)
2011-06-22T07:20:35  <mcstar> ok, go ahead
2011-06-22T07:20:39  <stocha> current top bot seems to start with peacefullness in mind
2011-06-22T07:20:51  <stocha> but in 1vs1 it would probably be bad ...
2011-06-22T07:20:51  <george1914> ok, simple stuff:    doing genetic programming.   i imagine it is easy for the master 'evolving program'  to mutate the 'candidates' in lisp, than it would be in c++ (where eg i might need to compile each 'candidate' on the run)
2011-06-22T07:21:07  <stocha> So make 10% of the game be 1vs1, and then people will have to tune their aggressivity
2011-06-22T07:21:20  <stocha> ha ha ha. okay it's not funy. sorry :p
2011-06-22T07:22:00  <stocha> george1914: does that kind of "genetic" programming actually work ?
2011-06-22T07:22:08  <mcstar> george1914: in that example, as i beleive aerique can confirm, yes its easier, you can directly compile as in assemble code that you can execute, without resorting to writing a full minilanguge on top of C/whatever
2011-06-22T07:22:37  <mcstar> and the whole thing would fit into lisp very well
2011-06-22T07:22:38  <george1914> hm, does it work (so books tell me - i have not done it).   i believe it to be so, for some problems
2011-06-22T07:22:48  <mcstar> but thats not all
2011-06-22T07:23:21  <mcstar> for example i had in mind two different interpretations of your first question
2011-06-22T07:23:41  <mcstar> the first one relates to the repl
2011-06-22T07:24:06  <mcstar> its the interface to the language, when running interactively
2011-06-22T07:24:12  <stocha> what kind of problem does it work ? (when you tweak actual instruction flow, and not just some parameters)
2011-06-22T07:24:53  <mcstar> you can change basically a running program rededfine functions, classes, everything updates accordingly
2011-06-22T07:25:25  <mcstar> and related to this lisp has got a very powerful error handling capability
2011-06-22T07:25:35  <stocha> @later tell janzert Current top bots seems to be peacefull at the start. Think having 10% of game 1vs1 might incit more aggressiv behaviors (hence shorter games)
2011-06-22T07:25:35  <contestbot> stocha: Aye, aye, sir
2011-06-22T07:25:54  <mcstar> you can basically recover from any error(except segfaults that happen in the core(i beleive))
2011-06-22T07:26:19  <mcstar> and the stack is not unwound as they say, that is all the nested calls remain in place
2011-06-22T07:26:25  <george1914> so you say that you can develop/debug/test   faster in lisp than in compiled language?
2011-06-22T07:26:34  <Zaphus> stocha:  make the games really short, first one to find some food wins !  :-)
2011-06-22T07:26:37  <mcstar> lisp is compiled
2011-06-22T07:26:50  <stocha> i can develop/debug faster in java then i can in lisp
2011-06-22T07:26:58  <mcstar> (it depends on implementation, but for example sbcl always compiles)
2011-06-22T07:27:10  <stocha> Zaphus: bleh
2011-06-22T07:27:17  <Zaphus> :-)
2011-06-22T07:27:22  <stocha> i want there to be a few 1vs1 games
2011-06-22T07:27:29  <george1914> the nearest i know to this is eg mathematica or matlab, where i can run each function from command line, and inspect/modify variables from the command line
2011-06-22T07:27:42  <mcstar> thats not the same
2011-06-22T07:28:11  <mcstar> the other interpretation is that you can literally make up code as your program runs
2011-06-22T07:28:21  <george1914> ok.  (i found that useful in mathematica).  but lisp has more than that?
2011-06-22T07:28:23  <Zaphus> stocha:  I'd like some of the other things fixed first,  the change to the matching algorithm sucks now.   But I don't see any reason we can't have 2-bot maps
2011-06-22T07:28:31  <stocha> there is this tiny tiny map, i wouldn't have test my bot 1vs1 on. And yet they manage to crank 5 bots in there :p I wonder what the ranking for this particular map looks like
2011-06-22T07:28:42  <aerique> george1914: here are my first steps into genetic programming using lisp: http://aerique.blogspot.com/2011/01/baby-steps-into-genetic-programming.html
2011-06-22T07:28:47  <mcstar> but you dont have to use strings or something else to represent it, you can use the structure that lisp uses otherwise: linked lists
2011-06-22T07:29:01  <stocha> Zaphus: what's wrong with the current matching ?
2011-06-22T07:29:16  <Zaphus> stocha:  it's playing the same sets over and over, with very little variety
2011-06-22T07:29:18  <stocha> i have seen some games between close strength bot. I'm happy with that
2011-06-22T07:29:21  <mcstar> george1914: ant there is another possibility which is related : macro expansion
2011-06-22T07:29:27  <mcstar> t->d
2011-06-22T07:29:33  <aerique> george1914: best thing is to use lisp for a while and see if you like it
2011-06-22T07:29:41  <stocha> Zaphus: it only play close games ?
2011-06-22T07:29:50  <stocha> Zaphus: or worst, some do never play ?
2011-06-22T07:29:55  <aerique> george1914: and bug mcstar and me (and perhaps people on #lisp) for help
2011-06-22T07:30:19  <aerique> george1914: it's a bit of a love-hate language
2011-06-22T07:30:28  <Zaphus> stocha:  only close games - and that means you play the same opponents over and over until someone manages to move up or down a spot. - no variety any more
2011-06-22T07:30:39  <george1914> aerique - thanks for that.   i have looked at the GP field guide also.
2011-06-22T07:30:40  <mcstar> i guess the people who really hate it just didnt try hard enough
2011-06-22T07:30:44  <stocha> Although variety is of course a cool addition, i would be happy whith anthing from 10% to 90% games being "close" games
2011-06-22T07:31:06  <aerique> george1914: i'm working on a video for McLeopold for using CL in this challenge
2011-06-22T07:31:10  <Zaphus> well, since we're probably at 90%, are you happy ?
2011-06-22T07:31:13  <aerique> *screencast
2011-06-22T07:31:14  <stocha> Zaphus: it seems fair though. fairer than pure random i would say
2011-06-22T07:31:17  <mcstar> george1914: let me give you a nice example
2011-06-22T07:31:21  <mcstar> ill look it up
2011-06-22T07:31:30  <george1914> i say that i write (encapsulated) fortran in any/every language.   if i were to learn lisp, it would have to be because it allowed me to do more than that ...
2011-06-22T07:31:34  <Zaphus> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=93    this guy wouldnt think so (ignore the fact that all those bots suck)
2011-06-22T07:31:44  <stocha> Zaphus: i'm happier with how it is now, that what it used to be. Then maybe 50% / 50% would be okay
2011-06-22T07:32:11  <Zaphus> or, 4/5 bots close, one outsider dropped in - something like that perhaps ?
2011-06-22T07:32:28  <mcstar> look at his site under examples: http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/tutorial.html
2011-06-22T07:32:44  <stocha> you can do whatever you want with the remaining 50%
2011-06-22T07:32:52  <stocha> from pure random, to anything in between :p
2011-06-22T07:33:07  <mcstar> it show the power of lisp: you can embed html/javascript in it, and serve it on a webserver directly
2011-06-22T07:33:10  <mcstar> s
2011-06-22T07:33:29  <stocha> i guess pure random as it merits. or you split 25% 25% and go for 25% with on or two random outsiders, and 25 with pure random
2011-06-22T07:33:49  <Zaphus> people in the middle are better off, they will get matches against people above and below - but the person at the top is playing the same 9 opponents every game now it seems (or a subset of them)
2011-06-22T07:34:12  <stocha> Zaphus: your outsider idea is good i guess.
2011-06-22T07:34:24  <mcstar> aerique: are you familiar with racket?
2011-06-22T07:34:53  <aerique> mcstar: very little, i'm doing The Little Schemer in it currently
2011-06-22T07:35:06  <mcstar> is that a tutorial?
2011-06-22T07:35:18  <stocha> Zaphus:  let's say we go for 25% close game. Then 25% one outsider. and then 50% for other pairing schemes :p
2011-06-22T07:35:26  <stocha> Zaphus: have a deal ?
2011-06-22T07:35:29  <aerique> mcstar: no, a nice short book about recursion
2011-06-22T07:35:44  <stocha> Zaphus: (yeah i realize we have no authoritie, but it's nice to agree on something still :p )
2011-06-22T07:35:51  <Zaphus> stocha:  :-)   yeah
2011-06-22T07:36:25  <aerique> mcstar: http://junix-linux-config.googlecode.com/files/The.Little.Schemer.4th.2.pdf
2011-06-22T07:36:28  <stocha> Zaphus: send a word to people with power maybe :p
2011-06-22T07:36:28  <aerique> mcstar: wooops
2011-06-22T07:36:33  <mcstar> aerique: i look at your github again, and there was that auxesia stuff, which language was the easier to implement it?
2011-06-22T07:36:48  <aerique> mcstar: http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992
2011-06-22T07:37:03  <aerique> mcstar: aucesia?
2011-06-22T07:37:07  <aerique> mcstar: eh, what?>
2011-06-22T07:37:13  <mcstar> auxesia
2011-06-22T07:37:18  <stocha> i probably should be back at having a start with this new bot i want to test.
2011-06-22T07:37:39  <stocha> why is it so not-fun to implement ideas ?
2011-06-22T07:37:44  <mcstar> the GAHElloWorld stuff
2011-06-22T07:37:50  <Zaphus> stocha:  A mix of methods would be good, not sure how you make sure that all bots get involved in all mixes, leave that to someone smart
2011-06-22T07:37:53  <mcstar> you used that as a namespace
2011-06-22T07:38:23  <stocha> Zaphus: still i'll be very happy with a large number of game being close one :)
2011-06-22T07:38:29  <aerique> mcstar: i did?
2011-06-22T07:38:46  <stocha> i think i had way more information about how the consest might go on, with those late games , than in the whole previous weeks.
2011-06-22T07:38:53  <aerique> mcstar: ah right, i only did the CL part of that
2011-06-22T07:39:01  <mcstar> ah, ok i didnt know
2011-06-22T07:39:02  <Zaphus> stocha: how are the games your bots get at the moment ?  going the way you'd expect ?
2011-06-22T07:39:15  <stocha> Zaphus:  ?
2011-06-22T07:39:21  <mcstar> i was expecting a bit of a comparison :)
2011-06-22T07:39:24  <Zaphus> are you getting close games ?
2011-06-22T07:39:25  <stocha> i don't know. i don't have a bot really at the moment.
2011-06-22T07:39:26  <aerique> mcstar: sorry :)
2011-06-22T07:39:36  <stocha> Zaphus: i think i do yeah.
2011-06-22T07:39:50  <mcstar> aerique: so did you try to run the engine)
2011-06-22T07:39:51  <stocha> didn't check to hard for my bots. But it seems close game are frequent now.
2011-06-22T07:39:56  <mcstar> ?
2011-06-22T07:40:00  <aerique> mcstar: i did some GP stuff in C++ recently, but i can't compare that very well either since it's been 10 years since I did c++
2011-06-22T07:40:12  <aerique> mcstar: no, not yet
2011-06-22T07:40:22  <Zaphus> top 10 seems pretty similar to before, but the order has changed a bit
2011-06-22T07:40:34  <stocha> Zaphus: then i see that new submission have no touble reaching their rank. Like flag capper, or my new (old) FastRef bot (stoha02 last update)
2011-06-22T07:40:38  <mcstar> george1914: what do you think about the link i gave you?
2011-06-22T07:40:52  <aerique> mcstar: except optimizing it was as much as a drag as it is for cl
2011-06-22T07:41:06  <Zaphus> stocha:  yeah, I think I was wrong that it might take a while to settle, it seems to get there fast right now
2011-06-22T07:41:13  <stocha> Zaphus: the order is sensible to the bot population. Now aggressive bots (like my reference bot) get crush pretty quick in high strength games.
2011-06-22T07:41:50  <george1914> mcstar: hm - i want to do AI, am less interested in web apps...
2011-06-22T07:42:07  <george1914> i guess you are showing me that you can do mainstream things in lisp?
2011-06-22T07:42:15  <mcstar> no
2011-06-22T07:42:26  <mcstar> i wanted to point at its fexibility
2011-06-22T07:42:29  <george1914> but i would learn it for the things it can do that other languages cannot
2011-06-22T07:42:30  <mcstar> with l
2011-06-22T07:42:46  <aerique> george1914: http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/
2011-06-22T07:42:47  <george1914> hm
2011-06-22T07:42:50  <mcstar> i guess you dont appreciate it cause you dont know what is going on there...
2011-06-22T07:42:51  <stocha> Zaphus: for example davidjlui is now a top bot. Although i don't think it was in the past :p
2011-06-22T07:42:52  <mcstar> my fault
2011-06-22T07:43:10  <george1914> mcstar:  maybe so - if so, my apologies
2011-06-22T07:43:16  <mcstar> np
2011-06-22T07:43:39  <Zaphus> stocha: yes, it's interesting what wins now... especially that my dumber older bot does better than my current one that I thought fought better
2011-06-22T07:43:42  <mcstar> siebel's book is good, loop for blackbelts is a recurring chapter for me :D
2011-06-22T07:44:00  <aerique> george1914: most languages can do what others can, question is how hard do they make it for you
2011-06-22T07:44:07  <stocha> Zaphus:  i think i'm pretty happy with the ranking right now.  I could have enough data that i can try to build a bot that will aim for top rank. If i had patience for that :p
2011-06-22T07:44:45  <stocha> Zaphus and Zaphus test are same ranking aren't they ?
2011-06-22T07:45:02  <stocha> Zaphus: what is your older bot, what it the newest one ?
2011-06-22T07:45:10  <Zaphus> close, yes - but the test one has no 'attack' code - it's older
2011-06-22T07:45:22  <stocha> Zaphus:  the top game, a very noisy. It's hard to understand what's going on, during the melting phase.
2011-06-22T07:45:39  <stocha> Zaphus: they are same strength it appears :p
2011-06-22T07:46:25  <Zaphus> stocha: yes, very noisy games..   those two are probably the same strength because the attack opportunities dont come up as much as I'd hoped (the way I have coded it)
2011-06-22T07:46:44  <stocha> the current difference between stocha and Sto03ReplirCrush is that they run the same code, but after 600 turns, Sto03 transforms itself into the refGreedyBot. They have same strength. That give me confidence in the ratings.
2011-06-22T07:46:49  <george1914> aerique:  in c++ i need to call compiler if i chage code in a function - i could do that i guess, but would be -very- difficult/flaky etc
2011-06-22T07:47:06  <mcstar> C-c C-c
2011-06-22T07:47:10  <george1914> sure one can say 'turing complete' or something, but in practical terms ...
2011-06-22T07:47:14  <stocha> Zaphus:  adding 1vs1 games would make the challenge more interesting though, don't you think ?
2011-06-22T07:47:38  <stocha> george1914: turing complet has practical meaning. It will be hard to debut for example :)
2011-06-22T07:47:44  <stocha> debug
2011-06-22T07:48:17  <george1914> aye - i mean that i agree with aerique that one can do anything.   but in practice one cannot
2011-06-22T07:48:21  <Zaphus> stocha:  perhaps, I've done local testing of that by creating a "sleeperbot" that just sits there, then I can effectively do 1v1 .   I see no reason to prevent 1v1, although my bots tend to do better in larger battles for some reason
2011-06-22T07:48:23  <stocha> george1914: turing complete is the same as saying that you can make program arbitrarily impossible to understand what they are doing, i believe.
2011-06-22T07:49:04  <stocha> Zaphus: so, now i only have 99 more people to convince of that :p  Who's next ?
2011-06-22T07:49:09  <george1914> as i undertood it, it meant i could reproduce any other computer program in it
2011-06-22T07:49:27  <stocha> Zaphus: would you send a word to mcleopold that you crave for 1vs1 to exist too ? :p
2011-06-22T07:49:37  <Zaphus> Has someone added an "end the game early" rule ? - I don;t understand why this game ends when it does:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=31850&user=225
2011-06-22T07:49:52  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah.
2011-06-22T07:50:04  <mcstar> turing complete essentially means, it is capable of doing any deterministic calculation
2011-06-22T07:50:08  <stocha> Zaphus:  a game end if 90% of the ants are owned by one player or by the food player.
2011-06-22T07:50:23  <aerique> i wasn't trying to play the turing complete card :-|
2011-06-22T07:50:30  <stocha> mcstar: why deterministic ?
2011-06-22T07:50:31  <george1914> mcstar:  aerique:   thanks for your comments - nice to encounter some lisp people.  i'll have at look at the links you sent.
2011-06-22T07:50:38  <Zaphus> and they have to hold that 90% for 100 turns or something ?
2011-06-22T07:50:49  <stocha> Zaphus:  ah yeah maybe.
2011-06-22T07:51:06  <mcstar> just think of quantum computers: they are non-deterministic non-turing computing device
2011-06-22T07:51:08  <mcstar> s
2011-06-22T07:51:16  <aerique> george1914: i'll post the screencast to the forums when it's complete
2011-06-22T07:51:26  <Zaphus> stocha:  so why does this end:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=31922&user=93   (other than the fact that it is boring)
2011-06-22T07:51:35  <george1914> aerique:  sure, i know.   we are instead debating   quite 'how hard is it to do it in this langauge'?
2011-06-22T07:51:36  <Zaphus> all bots have the same number of ants in that
2011-06-22T07:52:16  <stocha> Zaphus: food player won with 90% more ants than everyone else for 100 turns.
2011-06-22T07:52:25  <george1914> aerique: i'll look out for it
2011-06-22T07:52:46  <Zaphus> stocha:  whats "food player" ?
2011-06-22T07:52:49  <aerique> george1914: yes.  i find lisp fights me the least (and bockimacko said the same in his blog i think)
2011-06-22T07:52:52  <stocha> Zaphus: nice one that blooby
2011-06-22T07:52:59  <stocha> Zaphus: it's the food .
2011-06-22T07:53:22  <Zaphus> stocha: oh, right :-)   lots of food = stop the game because nobody is really playing
2011-06-22T07:53:33  <stocha> Zaphus: never saw a film with vandam ? Vandam hits the tree, and breaks his leg. The master come, and proclaim the tree is the winner.
2011-06-22T07:54:12  <mcstar> isnt that jackie chan?
2011-06-22T07:54:15  <Zaphus> stocha:  MrBlobby is another of my testing bots, totally different algorithm (barely enough code to register as an algorithm) - I'm trying to add some variety in there :-)
2011-06-22T07:54:15  <stocha> Zaphus: is mister bloby one of yours ?
2011-06-22T07:54:28  <stocha> quick answer if there was one :)
2011-06-22T07:54:41  <stocha> nanotime lapse answer :p
2011-06-22T07:55:09  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah i do that too. Though it's a fact i already had the bots ready
2011-06-22T07:55:39  <Zaphus> I wanted to get a 'clumping' bot in there, rather than all the spread out ones... although I suspect it won't get too high on the ladder
2011-06-22T07:55:46  <stocha> Zaphus: i wanted to do a blob bot. i always kinda of failed. This one looks nice. Although maybe you will need a better start (i didn't look at it)
2011-06-22T07:56:01  <stocha> Zaphus: mine are like 20 in rank
2011-06-22T07:56:23  <stocha> Sto03 is 20 and stocha is 19
2011-06-22T07:56:37  <stocha> so that's a lesser bound of how high a blobber bot should aim.
2011-06-22T07:58:00  <Zaphus> nice,  MrBlobby is unaware of enemy ants so he won't get that high, but if we can get more blob ones in there then that may give smarter people ideas
2011-06-22T07:58:25  <stocha> Zaphus: aren't we the smarter people in there ?
2011-06-22T07:58:49  <stocha> i'm a strong believer in diversity. you probably are too :p
2011-06-22T07:58:59  <Zaphus> :-)
2011-06-22T07:59:27  <stocha> do you mind sharing the internals of the blobby part ?
2011-06-22T08:00:00  <stocha> it seems distracted by food
2011-06-22T08:00:42  <stocha> is it like pick up random blob point, and go to closest one, unless there is food ?
2011-06-22T08:00:45  <Zaphus> it's pretty simple - for each ant it tries all 4 directions and scores the new position.  food distracts it, but otherwise it likes to be next to it's friends, and it likes to go to places that are not currently visible
2011-06-22T08:01:07  <stocha> oh it's a heavy heat map calculation then :p
2011-06-22T08:01:24  <stocha> i want to build a heavy heat map bot too. I'd like to see how far he goes.
2011-06-22T08:01:47  <stocha> i have a day free today. I'm yet to start to work on my new bot :'(
2011-06-22T08:01:48  <Zaphus> whats a 'heavy' heat map ?
2011-06-22T08:01:52  <stocha> why is it so hard :p
2011-06-22T08:02:22  <Zaphus> well, I did google it, but google didnt know
2011-06-22T08:02:23  <stocha> heat map, is when you have value for each point of the map. Heavy is when they take lots of time to updated each turn (or recalculate)
2011-06-22T08:02:44  <stocha> Zaphus:  i'm not kind on using existing words. I prefer to invent my own :p
2011-06-22T08:03:15  <stocha> light heat map would be a heat map that is o(n) :p
2011-06-22T08:03:29  <Zaphus> then this is light
2011-06-22T08:03:43  <stocha> the one i want to try is super heavy. i don't know if the thing will handle the first ant in a second :p
2011-06-22T08:03:49  <Zaphus> it always considers the same number of squares each turn for each ant
2011-06-22T08:04:29  <aerique> anyone done a "snake" bot yet?
2011-06-22T08:04:32  <stocha> Zaphus: light is when you only depend on map size.  Here you depend on number of ant. So it's semi-light then :p
2011-06-22T08:05:06  <stocha> aerique: my stoha02 has some snake like properties   :p  But not enougth to make it a true snake
2011-06-22T08:05:11  <stocha> if i have time, i'll make one i guess.
2011-06-22T08:05:19  <stocha> because it seems to be a lot of demands for it.
2011-06-22T08:05:45  <aerique> mostly for the silliness :)
2011-06-22T08:05:45  <Zaphus> If it were a 2-3 thick snake it could probably eat the ants it comes up against
2011-06-22T08:06:17  <stocha> maybe i should do that. Sound's easier than my current heavy heat bot. (one ant thick though)
2011-06-22T08:06:24  <stocha> let me see what i can do quick.
2011-06-22T08:07:32  <Zaphus> silliness is good, never underestimate it :-)
2011-06-22T08:08:04  <aerique> stocha: just checked stoha02 out, looks fun.
2011-06-22T08:09:46  <Zaphus> matches look much cooler at +5 or so speed.   stoha02 looks good like that

2011-06-22T08:15:34  <mcstar> the snake bot must be kept a secret
2011-06-22T08:19:41  <stocha> mcstar: muh ?
2011-06-22T08:19:51  <Zaphus> i.e. dont release the code... but it's ok to tell people there's a snake - I assume thats what he means
2011-06-22T08:20:10  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah that's how i took it.
2011-06-22T08:20:12  <mcstar> yes, of course, thats what i Said

2011-06-22T08:21:27  <mcstar> im upset a bit cause i cant fry potate with meat porperly
2011-06-22T08:21:38  <mcstar> its in the own for 2 hours now
2011-06-22T08:21:41  <mcstar> owen
2011-06-22T08:21:49  <mcstar> v?
2011-06-22T08:22:28  <aerique> if your hot potato is in Owen you've got some explaining to do
2011-06-22T08:23:14  <stocha> mcstar: trouble is, the code i'm using also will be linked to parts of my most recent framework (which is quite old, but way more readable than already published code from me :p)
2011-06-22T08:23:47  <stocha> mcstar: so you might be right. Still i can publish the bot behavior. and let people give me ideas of how to improve it. At some point i will publish the code anyway.
2011-06-22T08:23:56  <stocha> i mean who cares ?
2011-06-22T08:24:05  <stocha> it's not like i had on of the top 5 bots.
2011-06-22T08:24:42  <mcstar> the meat is burned, and the potato is still not right
2011-06-22T08:25:04  <mcstar> stocha: i think giving people starter kits was a great enough help
2011-06-22T08:25:30  <stocha> i never gave them starter kits.
2011-06-22T08:25:51  <stocha> but i think the challenge is about having fun. So if sharing code become fun for me, i'll do it.
2011-06-22T08:26:01  <mcstar> NOT giving them those means less bots, but who write their bots will probably stay to the very end of the torunament
2011-06-22T08:26:08  <stocha> at this point, the fun is in having a snake bot, so let's see how i do it.
2011-06-22T08:26:42  <stocha> mcstar: i don't imagine people comming as for as getting in there, and not wanted to write their own bot.
2011-06-22T08:26:50  <stocha> what would they be doing in there then ?
2011-06-22T08:26:54  *** foRei <foRei!~ViT@0x4dd7b24d.adsl.cybercity.dk> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-22T08:26:56  <stocha> waiting for christmas ?
2011-06-22T08:27:07  <mcstar> i think many people will just upload something and then leave it there
2011-06-22T08:27:25  <stocha> Then my code is pretty confusing, even when it's readable. Which is not always the case.
2011-06-22T08:27:28  <mcstar> if you spend time writing your own from ground up, you will saty
2011-06-22T08:27:46  <Zaphus> stocha:  they'd grab your bot, upload it, maybe make a change, upload, get bored, never return  - but we've now got dozens of stochas in there :-)
2011-06-22T08:28:12  <stocha> Zaphus: that's a problem true. But my bots are still good for testing.
2011-06-22T08:28:26  <mcstar> Zaphus: yes, thats what i mean for example
2011-06-22T08:28:49  <stocha> I could have get bored mayself and never returned. That was why i wanted to make it avaiable. So people can have fun out of it. if i don't.
2011-06-22T08:28:52  <mcstar> share code or ideas, i dont care just dont make full bots available for download
2011-06-22T08:29:06  <stocha> mcstar: how will people test their bot then ?
2011-06-22T08:29:28  <Zaphus> on the server, or TCP, or they can use someones .exe bots that have no sourcecode inside them
2011-06-22T08:29:54  <mcstar> exactly
2011-06-22T08:29:59  <Zaphus> problem is that Java doesnt know how to protect your IP
2011-06-22T08:30:29  <mcstar> run it in a virtual machine
2011-06-22T08:30:39  <mcstar> if you really care that much
2011-06-22T08:30:50  <Zaphus> can you do that ?   package it up somehow so that the code isnt available ?
2011-06-22T08:31:19  <mcstar> i mean, if you are afraid that somebody back-hacks your connection to the tcp server, run your bot in a wm
2011-06-22T08:31:31  <mcstar> or if you are afraid of illegitim tcp server
2011-06-22T08:31:33  <stocha> Zaphus: what ?
2011-06-22T08:31:34  <mcstar> s
2011-06-22T08:31:50  <stocha> Zaphus: java is a problem when you use applet. not when you run a client from a server.
2011-06-22T08:32:06  <stocha> so if you run your bot locally be it java or c, it's the same.
2011-06-22T08:32:11  <Zaphus> oh, no, I meant people uploading their bots so others can test locally (who dont or can't use TCP) - .exe is OK for that (if you ignore virus/trojan issues)
2011-06-22T08:32:22  <stocha> problem is, i have no way to run a bot locally for extended periods.
2011-06-22T08:32:41  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah. But .exe are platform dependent
2011-06-22T08:33:00  <stocha> Zaphus: then i'm quite sure, that even with the most bacis of obfsucator my bot code would be quite secured.
2011-06-22T08:33:34  <Zaphus> stocha: not quite, since it could be uploaded with no change...   if there were a way to make it work locally but not on the server that would be interesting
2011-06-22T08:33:47  <stocha> Zaphus: it would take some very dedicated people to study it.... even without obfuscation maybe :p      But it's possible to hack it as code again.
2011-06-22T08:34:27  <stocha> Zaphus: yeaht decompiling the java bot, for uploading it under your brand, and then going on with your life is not that likely a behavior for people to have.
2011-06-22T08:34:29  <mcstar> wth are you talking about? copy protection??? i guess you are used to it
2011-06-22T08:34:44  <stocha> mabye someone can hack a way to do that with c programs also.

2011-06-22T08:35:27  <stocha> althoug impractical i think.
2011-06-22T08:35:48  <mcstar> i just dont like the principle of what you are discussing
2011-06-22T08:35:54  <stocha> mggnn, i should be back to doing my snake. then back to doing my actual bot :p
2011-06-22T08:36:47  <stocha> mcstar: it's very usefull for people to have a bot to test against. the tcp server will do the job, for people that can run a bot for extended periods of time.
2011-06-22T08:37:00  <stocha> but local testing is much faster and flexible.
2011-06-22T08:37:22  <mcstar> yeah, instead of giving up your code, host a tcp server if you can
2011-06-22T08:37:33  <mcstar> of course these are only my opinions
2011-06-22T08:37:57  <stocha> i can't even run my own testings at this point. i have no machine left, but this laptop. All 5 computers are down. And i have no money to run my server anymore.
2011-06-22T08:38:28  <mcstar> fix one of the 5? :D
2011-06-22T08:38:38  <stocha> mcstar: how do i do that ?
2011-06-22T08:38:46  <mcstar> whats the problem?
2011-06-22T08:38:59  <stocha> there is one that shut down after a few minutes
2011-06-22T08:39:08  <mcstar> cant you put 1 together from the 5?
2011-06-22T08:39:09  <stocha> there is one that goes screen white after a few minute.
2011-06-22T08:39:17  <stocha> there is another one that shuts down after a few minutes.
2011-06-22T08:39:32  <mcstar> thats the 1st one
2011-06-22T08:39:39  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-06-22T08:39:39  <stocha> then there are pieces all around, that probably don't work, or don't even plug in modern systems.
2011-06-22T08:39:46  <stocha> mcstar: no i have two in that case :)
2011-06-22T08:40:00  <stocha> i have some of my computer, that are not at home also.
2011-06-22T08:40:16  <stocha> some people are using it.
2011-06-22T08:40:32  <stocha> (like father, brother, whoever wanted to launch his own business etc)
2011-06-22T08:40:46  <mcstar> i cant host tcp cause my crappy connection
2011-06-22T08:40:49  <stocha> so i'm left with nothing working right now, but this laptop :p
2011-06-22T08:41:06  <Zaphus> off to eat some icecream and watch TV for a bit - hope to see that snake out there soon !

2011-06-22T08:41:35  <mcstar> well, i dont have that kind of money
2011-06-22T08:41:45  <Rabidus> i can host a tcp if every user gives me one euro per month :p
2011-06-22T08:42:10  <stocha> i 'm in debt at the moment, so i' can't argue for 15 euros with my wife, when i already have 400 to pay for past month :p
2011-06-22T08:42:26  <stocha> Rabidus: what if nouser shows up ? or only one ?
2011-06-22T08:42:41  <Rabidus> then he will not have an opponent, but server stays up

2011-06-22T09:26:30  <mleise> yay! thunderstorm and 22Â°C
2011-06-22T09:26:55  <mleise> time to take a shower :p
2011-06-22T09:27:28  <mcstar> watch out for your computer
2011-06-22T09:28:49  <mcstar> thunderstorm was coming, i turned it off, i thought it was gone, than fing lightnings came again, and the power went out for less than 1 sec, but my pc shut down, and i couldnt boot it up for quite a few minutes
2011-06-22T09:32:25  <mleise> oh i *should* turn it off, but I'm always waiting for the proof that it can kill my computer
2011-06-22T09:33:07  <mleise> there is a huge church steeple 100m from my home, it'll catch the lightning :)
2011-06-22T09:33:33  <mcstar> lucky you, im worried for my data
2011-06-22T09:33:51  <mcstar> in december a lost a 320gb hdd with 60gb important data
2011-06-22T09:34:27  <mleise> ouch, I have an old backup on my external drive. I should update that again.
2011-06-22T09:38:12  <mleise> It's a good thing Linux makes it so easy to mount images of file systems somewhere. Under Windows I was never sure if I had to remember drive letter, partition sizes or keep the backup software I used on some other media.
2011-06-22T09:49:39  <mleise> wow, my light dimmed for the fraction of a second mcstar
2011-06-22T09:50:26  <mleise> I guess a notebook can handle that better than a PC even when the battery is broken.

2011-06-22T10:40:30  <stocha> how do i solve this one ? :p
2011-06-22T10:42:41  <stocha> the think is, i can either have a warning for unsafe because i don't use generics, or an error because i'm trying to create an array of generics. In either case, the ant server will reject the code. So i wonder what the solution is. (not that this is a real problem, because it's in my mocked server, just a theoretical problem)
2011-06-22T10:43:24  <stocha> wow Zaphus reached 4 place. i'll have to bow to him now :'(

2011-06-22T10:55:07  <janzert> and has been fixed for FF 6 for about a week, it won't be fixed in FF 5
2011-06-22T10:55:30  <antimatroid> ... when would ff6 likely release?
2011-06-22T10:55:36  <aerique> maybe FF6 will be out before the contest begins
2011-06-22T10:55:46  <antimatroid> janzert: i've no experience with this kind of stuff, but isn't that really poor on their part?
2011-06-22T10:55:50  <janzert> it'll be out in 3 months :)
2011-06-22T10:56:09  <janzert> antimatroid: not really, it's an edge case of a rarely used feature
2011-06-22T10:56:21  <janzert> any mildly complex software is going to ship with lots of bugs
2011-06-22T10:56:38  <janzert> you just hope they aren't in areas where many people will notice ;)
2011-06-22T10:57:01  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough, i'll just leave them alone and feel bad for meliese :(
2011-06-22T10:57:49  <janzert> get one of the top 1 million websites to start using it then it will have to work in every release :P
2011-06-22T10:58:55  <janzert> of that's a catch 22 since none of them will use it till 99% of browsers do, which means IE has to support it :(
2011-06-22T11:00:03  <stocha> still no game played for my new bot :'(
2011-06-22T11:00:15  <stocha> i want to check if i uploaded the right one :p

2011-06-22T11:01:26  <stocha> well, those are different bots,
2011-06-22T11:01:37  <stocha> they are not connected one with another.

2011-06-22T13:27:13  <McLeopold> maybe it was jmcarthur that made it?

2011-06-22T13:29:10  <McLeopold> oh, I see the difference
2011-06-22T13:29:19  <janzert> that's what I meant by they only take 2 actions on their own
2011-06-22T13:29:52  <McLeopold> let's make that clear then
2011-06-22T13:29:59  <antimatroid> McLeopold: http://pastebin.com/1Pduq66A
2011-06-22T13:30:12  <antimatroid> you might have to escape the '|'s as '\|'

2011-06-22T13:32:21  <McLeopold> is there latex in the github wiki?

2011-06-22T14:40:31  <McLeopold> if you didn't build a jar file, you would have to pass a class path on the command line

2011-06-22T15:15:15  <guitardude012> george1914: sorry, both the python bots supplied with the tools archive and the c++ starter bot seem to crash
2011-06-22T15:15:35  <stocha> i could activate it on my stronger bot ... but i was holding that back for a stronger bot, if i happen to finally build one.
2011-06-22T15:15:37  <mcstar> ascii art as in funny text assembled from ants
2011-06-22T15:15:46  <mcstar> ok, the art part is a bit misleading
2011-06-22T15:16:19  <stocha> mcstar: i was more intending to show some bit maps. A smilley being first on my list. I have built a system that can do that.
2011-06-22T15:16:31  <guitardude012> I should be able to just unzip tools.zip and run play_one_game.sh right?  It opens in the browser but the ants crash on the first turn
2011-06-22T15:16:43  <mcstar> can you incorporate water into your pattern?
2011-06-22T15:16:54  <george1914> guitardude012: hm, strange...   your playgame.py runs ok  (ie it gives output such as number of bots crashed, number of ants, etc?)
2011-06-22T15:16:55  <guitardude012> on my linux box and my friend's mac as well
2011-06-22T15:17:05  <guitardude012> george1914: correct
2011-06-22T15:17:21  <stocha> mcstar:  the plan is to ignore water. So there will be holes. But the shape will be recognizable. Hopefully
2011-06-22T15:17:29  <mcstar> guitardude012: i think theres something wrong with the power supply, check that first
2011-06-22T15:17:50  <george1914> ok,    you got c++ starterbot from github?
2011-06-22T15:18:20  <guitardude012> dowload from hypertriangle
2011-06-22T15:18:24  <george1914> (ought not to matter, but that would be the latest one for sure)
2011-06-22T15:18:40  <guitardude012> download*   but I trust the python bots in the tools.zip archive more
2011-06-22T15:19:09  <mcstar> im not sure whats on hypertriangle but if i were you id use github
2011-06-22T15:19:18  <george1914> try:   https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-06-22T15:19:30  <george1914> the bots are in the ants directory
2011-06-22T15:19:54  <george1914> maybe try the c++ bot first?   - that really ought to work ...

2011-06-22T15:21:16  <mcstar> i know its no big deal, but i couldnt really develop my bot earlier
2011-06-22T15:21:26  <stocha> stocha: by finish you mean it will be fully tested and functional ?
2011-06-22T15:21:40  <guitardude012> figured it out I think, I have an older version of python
2011-06-22T15:21:40  <stocha> mcstar: yeah, but i also know how much sharing is important to everyone.
2011-06-22T15:22:00  <guitardude012> was using 2.6.6 =/
2011-06-22T15:22:17  <guitardude012> the git version made it obvious with a dictionary comprehension syntax error
2011-06-22T15:22:21  <mcstar> stocha: i dont really egt it, why did sharing come up again?
2011-06-22T15:22:26  <stocha> mcstar: human tend to need to speak about what they do, and be proud of it. it's good that other people are able to recognize what we achieve. Even if everyone does the same thing over and over again :p
2011-06-22T15:22:36  <stocha> mcstar:  i don't know.

2011-06-22T15:23:17  <mcstar> look, if my alg. is finished, i will share the idea behind it, cause i know that you have your own
2011-06-22T15:23:25  <stocha> when everyone that build a bot, will at some point also reach this same point. Yet it's exciting moment, and its good to share it (talk of it)
2011-06-22T15:23:50  <mcstar> yeah, but do you know Stargate?
2011-06-22T15:23:54  <stocha> mcstar:  it may be the same. I doubt that there are infinitely many was of doing that :p
2011-06-22T15:24:20  <stocha> mcstar: i have seen a film. And some episod of a show. Some where good. Some were bad.
2011-06-22T15:24:25  <stocha> mcstar: what bout it ? :)
2011-06-22T15:24:46  <mcstar> well, there are many races in it, who wont share their advanced tech. with humans

2011-06-22T15:25:24  <stocha> mcstar: yeah. But the show doesn't try to hard to be realistic. Its just a view of an average american over the world.

2011-06-22T15:26:00  <stocha> mcstar: yeah. I always find that re discovering is powerfull way to learn.
2011-06-22T15:26:00  <mcstar> well, despite im being hungarian, i guess then this makes me an average american too
2011-06-22T15:26:20  <stocha> mcstar:  there are a lot of average americans in the world lately :)
2011-06-22T15:26:31  <stocha> a few trillions most probably :p
2011-06-22T15:26:41  <stocha> billion ?
2011-06-22T15:26:44  <stocha> billion maybe.
2011-06-22T15:26:46  <mleise> I liked when Daniel Jackson was a jerk in the original movie that didn't care about the situation the team was in.
2011-06-22T15:26:47  <mcstar> rather
2011-06-22T15:26:49  <stocha> let's say half a billion then.
2011-06-22T15:27:04  <mcstar> lol, spader was a pussy

2011-06-22T15:27:45  <stocha> What i really like in the show, are the scenarios and humour. Some episods are very imaginativ i found.
2011-06-22T15:27:53  <mcstar> the movie has got nothing to do with the series
2011-06-22T15:28:14  <mcstar> true, humor was central to SG1

2011-06-22T15:29:11  <mcstar> well, actually, no
2011-06-22T15:29:18  <stocha> what's fun, is the role play joke about how they saved the world a few dozen times. How many times is it we save the world again ? Tilk : it's 47. I counted them.
2011-06-22T15:29:28  <mleise> even the space ships look the same

2011-06-22T15:31:08  <stocha> mleise: occasionnaly they do. They would kill a member of SG1 or severly wound him.
2011-06-22T15:31:23  <mcstar> they killed Frasier
2011-06-22T15:31:36  <stocha> they also like to kill minor characters.
2011-06-22T15:31:41  <jbroman> Or how about the fact that Goa'uld technology is advanced in terms of energy weapons, teleportation and spaceflight but very primitive otherwise.
2011-06-22T15:31:51  <stocha> Note that most of the time, SG1 would use non lethal weapons.
2011-06-22T15:32:02  <stocha> as would those that do hit them.
2011-06-22T15:32:11  <mleise> jbroman: they stole most of what makes them powerful from other cultures
2011-06-22T15:32:19  <mcstar> Goaul'ds are mainly scavangers of alien technology
2011-06-22T15:32:31  <mcstar> Anubis had pretty nice labs though
2011-06-22T15:32:48  <jbroman> mleise: Yeah, sure, but since they are capable of constructing spaceships they have at least some understanding of the underlying technology. Presumably it could be extrapolated somewhat.
2011-06-22T15:32:48  <mcstar> all of those weapons were lethal

2011-06-22T15:35:15  <jbroman> (OTOH, the only context the Tau'ri come into contact with them is in combat, so that may also explain it.)

2011-06-22T15:52:23  <mcstar> e
2011-06-22T15:52:27  <stocha_> there was good humor and inovative thinking in it.
2011-06-22T15:52:34  <stocha_> in the old ones i mean.
2011-06-22T15:52:55  <stocha_> the newest are more conventionnal. Especially as far as humor go. it really is a step back.
2011-06-22T15:53:01  <mcstar> the oldest thing i watched was Metropolis

2011-06-22T16:02:07  <stocha_> antimatroid: it seems that i have some trouble being undestood by native french speakers, when i try to say something in that language. Although this is my (only) native language.
2011-06-22T16:02:08  <mcstar> some people cant appreciate mental achievements
2011-06-22T16:02:18  <mcstar> thats because they havent done much of that
2011-06-22T16:02:45  <stocha_> mcstar: maybe they did, and we just fail to see it. as they totally fail to see what we do.
2011-06-22T16:03:32  <stocha_> A few days ago, i try to explain to someone that take the money in a supermarket, that i could     give here 20.10 when i had to pay 10.10
2011-06-22T16:03:41  <mcstar> language is subtle, for example i go crazy many times a day, cause my mom doesnt say exactly what she means
2011-06-22T16:03:41  <stocha_> (i wanted her to hand back 10)
2011-06-22T16:03:59  <stocha_> and she would go ... what does this guy want, i gave him the right amount of monney.
2011-06-22T16:04:14  <stocha_> (she handed back my 0.10, and gave me the monney)
2011-06-22T16:04:35  <mcstar> stocha_: it happends
2011-06-22T16:04:37  <mcstar> -d
2011-06-22T16:04:38  <stocha_> what amazed me, was how the other customes all though i was a totally crazy person.
2011-06-22T16:04:57  <antimatroid> stocha_: ergh, that would infuriate me
2011-06-22T16:04:59  <stocha_> people tend to be so different. Who is the crazyest, i wonder.
2011-06-22T16:05:26  <mcstar> i wanted to buy train tickets, the miss gave me double of what i wanted lol
2011-06-22T16:05:48  <mcstar> they cant count on their fingers i suppose
2011-06-22T16:05:49  <stocha_> then a few week, i met a homeless people that would want to build a space traveling capable ferari (he had drawing quite impressive for a homeless)
2011-06-22T16:06:20  <stocha_> he talked rubish, with how he was a pharaon, and talke about angstrom and how 3.1416 was important to him.
2011-06-22T16:06:51  <mcstar> 3.141592653
2011-06-22T16:06:55  <Bearaware> Snakebot!
2011-06-22T16:06:58  <stocha_> i didn't make out anything usefull of what he said. Yet i felt like i understood one thing : how must the people i talk to feel sometime. For them what i says just do not make sense.
2011-06-22T16:07:54  <stocha_> It was very refreshing in some ways. Though after a few 30 minutes, he still felt i didn't get it all. and i was started to get bored.
2011-06-22T16:08:12  <mcstar> my experience is this: when you get involved in an explanation, theres a limit that depends on the person, how long he/she is willing to pay attention
2011-06-22T16:08:12  <stocha_> I kept some of the drawings.
2011-06-22T16:08:38  <mcstar> your explanation must fit into that allotted time
2011-06-22T16:08:54  <mcstar> they simply give up following you
2011-06-22T16:09:32  <mcstar> lol, were you drunk? i couldnt speak for half an hour with a homeless guy

2011-06-22T16:18:33  <stocha_> why don't they try to make language simple ?
2011-06-22T16:18:48  <stocha_> why do speakers need to twist the rules here and there ?
2011-06-22T16:18:49  <mcstar> it is simple

2011-06-22T16:28:45  <mcstar> at least they call it 2D, cause you can step out of the line and use things like summas, integrals, whatever
2011-06-22T16:29:05  <mcstar> so the meaning of a thing is more or less defined by the position it appears

2011-06-22T16:31:22  <mcstar> he only says this this much all the time
2011-06-22T16:31:26  <stocha_> it's easier to supose that if he does it, he probably has good reasons.
2011-06-22T16:31:27  <mcstar> he doesnt answer to anything
2011-06-22T16:31:36  <stocha_> mcstar: maybe he can't.
2011-06-22T16:31:56  <stocha_> mcstar: but maybe he does read what you says. although i interpret it with a different set of mind.
2011-06-22T16:32:00  <mcstar> well, we answered his question so.... what else does he want?
2011-06-22T16:32:22  <stocha_> mcstar: good question. i think i was the bloody site back. it's important for him.
2011-06-22T16:32:27  <stocha_> he wants

2011-06-22T16:34:39  <stocha_> So let's supose for lack of better hypothesis that this is the case here. Although he might not be autist of course.
2011-06-22T16:34:58  <mcstar> stocha_: autist, no autist, whatever language he speaks, he can just use google translate, and write us some more

2011-06-22T16:35:28  <mcstar> i used that exactly to talk to spanish guy, and answer his questions about wall-jumping on a jumpserver in urban terror
2011-06-22T16:36:09  <mcstar> come on, he did well on the prev. contest so they say
2011-06-22T16:36:23  <mcstar> im expecting a little more, if he writes to a public forum
2011-06-22T16:36:42  <stocha_> mcstar: maybe he has no trouble understanding and doing easy stuff. Like bot making, and programming manuals.
2011-06-22T16:36:54  <stocha_> mcstar: but he has much trouble understanding people.
2011-06-22T16:37:01  <stocha_> i can't blame him then.
2011-06-22T16:37:09  <mcstar> stocha_: all in all i really dont give a rats ass, sorry to be harsh
2011-06-22T16:38:03  <stocha_> mcstar: for example, i totally don't understand. Because i have seen that you are a nice guy. so i don't understand this harshness.
2011-06-22T16:38:31  <stocha_> but then, it doesn't prevent use to talk, and to share some though.
2011-06-22T16:39:17  <mcstar> look there was unclevasya, he doesnt know english that well, but he at least tried to speak as good as he can
2011-06-22T16:39:21  <mcstar> i appreciated that
2011-06-22T16:39:24  <stocha_> mcstar: why did you saw this film twice, if you don't care how the main character can feel inside ?
2011-06-22T16:39:33  <mcstar> but this guy posts the same thing over and over again
2011-06-22T16:40:15  <mcstar> i like dustin hoffman, tom cruse, not soo much
2011-06-22T16:40:26  <mcstar> and i like films of geniuses
2011-06-22T16:40:45  <stocha_> mcstar: it's not only a geniuses. It's also an autist.
2011-06-22T16:40:47  <mcstar> beautiful mind, good will hunting
2011-06-22T16:41:05  <hacklash> speaking of people that speak russian, does GreenTea ever stop by here?
2011-06-22T16:41:12  <stocha_> the story revolve about him feeling and perceiving the world in a different way.
2011-06-22T16:41:12  <mcstar> yes
2011-06-22T16:41:14  <hacklash> mcstar: great movies
2011-06-22T16:41:35  <hacklash> especially good will hunting
2011-06-22T16:41:45  <mcstar> yeah, i like matt damon
2011-06-22T16:41:47  <stocha_> will hunting is a normal guy.
2011-06-22T16:42:01  <stocha_> although he can learn and do math easilly.
2011-06-22T16:42:12  <mcstar> not so normal you see :D
2011-06-22T16:42:23  <stocha_> rainman is much more exotic though.
2011-06-22T16:42:23  <hacklash> he's not particularly socially maladjusted
2011-06-22T16:42:27  <hacklash> just very smart

2011-06-22T16:43:40  <stocha_> what it feels like being them.
2011-06-22T16:43:50  <mcstar> stocha_: you must have misunderstood something: i didnt say i dont care about how they see the world
2011-06-22T16:44:21  <mcstar> i wqs simply annoyed by a repetitive behavior of a supposedly intellingent person
2011-06-22T16:45:11  <mcstar> and im only continuing this conversation, because i remotly care care what do you think about things such as this.
2011-06-22T16:45:19  <mcstar> but its getting a bit tedious
2011-06-22T16:45:23  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@120-49-80-78.tmcz.cz> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-06-22T16:46:10  <mcstar> lololol
2011-06-22T16:46:15  <mcstar> it happened again
2011-06-22T16:46:38  <mcstar> i just said something, and my mom reacted the Opposite way, the way that was illogical
2011-06-22T16:46:55  <mcstar> stocha_: the world is coming to an end
2011-06-22T16:47:12  <mcstar> lets code, i trust in the compiler
2011-06-22T16:47:28  <stocha_> "However one very important thing to remember when assessing an autistic child is their need for repetition and sameness. Keeping this in mind when setting lessons will be of benefit.  "
2011-06-22T16:48:14  <mcstar> normal people have needs too
2011-06-22T16:48:22  <mcstar> dont forget that either
2011-06-22T16:49:04  <stocha_> Need for sameness. Another sign of autism is a child's intense need for things to be the same. More than a normal toddler's desire to read the same book every night, an autistic child does the same things over and over again. Behaviors like arm flapping or head banging are not unusual. Spinning a plate for hours on end, or continually stacking or lining up toys are also common behaviors in autistic children.
2011-06-22T16:49:58  <mcstar> and again, why are you assuming that account is an autist?
2011-06-22T16:51:15  <mcstar> stocha_ pls dont paste any more quotes
2011-06-22T16:52:04  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@nat/google/x-hudwehfwznuyuydr> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-22T16:52:25  <stocha_> mcstar: it seems sensible to assume that.
2011-06-22T16:52:30  <stocha_> from that data i have.
2011-06-22T16:52:49  <stocha_> but it can be wrong of course.
2011-06-22T16:53:14  <stocha_> autism is very rare. high level autist are rarer still.
2011-06-22T16:53:44  <stocha_> why an autist would grew up intrested in such a contest is beyond me. but it's a possibility. and i'll stick to it until i have a better explanation.
2011-06-22T16:54:12  <mcstar> here is my explanation: the guy fetches the ai-contest page, checks the contents and if it cant find the right page, it says a message here
2011-06-22T16:54:19  <mcstar> i think its a bot that he set up
2011-06-22T16:54:38  <stocha_> mcstar:  that doesn't make sense to me. why would someone do that ?
2011-06-22T16:55:06  <mcstar> why not? i would definitely use a bot to chat on irc if i could do that?
2011-06-22T16:55:35  <mcstar> sorry, no second ?
2011-06-22T16:55:41  <stocha_> mcstar:  so, then you are hangry about this guy doing that.
2011-06-22T16:56:01  <mcstar> im hungarian, a bit hungry too, but not hangry for sure
2011-06-22T16:56:33  <mcstar> stocha_: theres quite a difference between angry and being annoyed
2011-06-22T16:56:36  <stocha_> or you are angry that the guy doing that, may end up being able to build a bot stronger than yours. When you really want to show that you can hack up a good bot.
2011-06-22T16:56:50  <stocha_> mm, you are being annoyed with that then.
2011-06-22T16:56:54  <mcstar> no, i dont think that far
2011-06-22T16:57:33  <stocha_> i though you found the behavior strange, and would like me to share my hopthesis.
2011-06-22T16:58:05  <stocha_> so i wanted to pointed that i had seen stuff about autist behavior that could fit the observed data.
2011-06-22T16:58:09  <mcstar> no, i just explained why did i say that to him
2011-06-22T16:58:34  <stocha_> we probably have said what we needed too then
2011-06-22T16:59:00  <stocha_> when will your bot be online ?
2011-06-22T16:59:13  <mcstar> one is online tight now
2011-06-22T16:59:15  <stocha_> i mean the one with the pathfinding
2011-06-22T16:59:15  <mcstar> r
2011-06-22T16:59:26  <stocha_> what's the name ?
2011-06-22T16:59:31  <mcstar> well, after im done talking to you
2011-06-22T16:59:43  <mcstar> the current one is imagine
2011-06-22T17:00:02  <mcstar> its very simple mainly random logic
2011-06-22T17:00:02  <stocha_> i tend to spend a lot of time talking, rather than acting it seems.
2011-06-22T17:00:31  <mcstar> whatever the case is, im gonna work on it, so excuse me

2011-06-22T18:46:06  <McLeopold> I noticed :)
2011-06-22T18:46:27  <McLeopold> I think maybe the indexes on beta are not in sync with my dev env
2011-06-22T18:46:32  <janzert> and came to the conclusion that a lot of the slow down I was seeing was the machine :/
