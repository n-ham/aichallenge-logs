2011-10-11T12:45:59  <smiley1983> mcstar: I just saw the conversation about this syntax:
2011-10-11T12:46:03  <smiley1983> gstate.tmap.(fst loc_e).(snd loc_e).seen
2011-10-11T12:48:03  <smiley1983> the .(parentheses) are for getting array elements, while the .tmap and .seen are for accessing fields in a type
2011-10-11T12:48:43  <delt0r_> does it have to be all in one line?
2011-10-11T12:48:59  <smiley1983> no, it's just shorter that way :)
2011-10-11T12:49:23  <delt0r_> and using a,b,c,d .... for variable names is also shorter
2011-10-11T12:50:14  <smiley1983> but this doesn't remove information like a,b,c,d, it just doesn't require you to use one line per access
2011-10-11T12:50:42  <delt0r_> not really... you can do the same thing in java too.. that does not make it a good idea
2011-10-11T12:51:15  <delt0r_> I mean its not like you need line breaks
2011-10-11T12:51:17  <delt0r_> :D
2011-10-11T12:51:26  <delt0r_> but we tend to use em
2011-10-11T12:51:36  <smiley1983> I'm not saying everyone should do this... and if I intend to use an element several times, I'll give it its own line
2011-10-11T12:51:46  <delt0r_> (python excluded )
2011-10-11T12:52:26  <smiley1983> but if I'm just accessing that one thing once locally, why add all those extra linebreaks? For me it just adds more stuff to read

2011-10-11T12:52:56  <delt0r_> which is not the limiting factor in any programming exercise
2011-10-11T12:53:00  <smiley1983> let local_tmap = gstate.tmap in
2011-10-11T12:53:46  <smiley1983> I'm not saying everyone should do this always
2011-10-11T12:53:57  <smiley1983> but some situations benefit from one approach, some from another

2011-10-11T13:08:37  <stocha> i looked at some games. No more point for killing ants ??
2011-10-11T13:08:57  <stocha> i don't understand where this is heading.
2011-10-11T13:09:12  <stocha> there is no description of the combat rule also.
2011-10-11T13:09:38  <stocha> arguably the games are a litle bit more watchable.
2011-10-11T13:09:59  <janzert1> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Focus-Battle-Resolution
2011-10-11T13:10:00  <stocha> is this still beta, or a started contest ?
2011-10-11T13:10:08  <smiley1983> 2 points for destroying enemy hills, and 1 for keeping your own
2011-10-11T13:10:27  <smiley1983> beta, new rules introduced to reduce the advantage of beta testers
2011-10-11T13:10:39  <smiley1983> I guess the new rules need beta testing too :)
2011-10-11T13:10:43  <stocha> you need to change the fighting rule then.
2011-10-11T13:10:57  <smiley1983> how so?
2011-10-11T13:10:59  <stocha> because that's what the beta testers built.
2011-10-11T13:11:06  <stocha> good fighting.
2011-10-11T13:11:22  <stocha> unless the objective is not to reduce the advantage of beta testers.
2011-10-11T13:11:51  <smiley1983> it's possible I misunderstood
2011-10-11T13:11:52  <stocha> Arguably, it's not easy to find a fighting rule.
2011-10-11T13:12:10  <smiley1983> indeed, since it took some time to expose the problem with the previous one
2011-10-11T13:12:36  <stocha> I guess the thing is okay. But i'm really not appealled by the scoring system.
2011-10-11T13:12:41  <stocha> most game are just random solved.
2011-10-11T13:12:46  <stocha> because everyone has same score.
2011-10-11T13:13:13  <smiley1983> at the moment, very few people are defending hills and only some are actively attacking
2011-10-11T13:14:23  <mcstar> huh
2011-10-11T13:15:23  <mcstar> diarrhea starting again
2011-10-11T13:15:25  <mcstar> damn it
2011-10-11T13:15:52  <mcstar> thats how you know im not a robot
2011-10-11T13:17:00  <mcstar> smiley1983: it looked like fst was a function, so () was needed to call it, with the input of the output of the last . piping its result to the next .
2011-10-11T13:17:12  <mcstar> but if its only for array indexing
2011-10-11T13:17:48  <mcstar> i probably should finish this sentence
2011-10-11T13:17:53  <mcstar> but im not going to
2011-10-11T13:19:07  <smiley1983> ocaml doesn't require parentheses for function calls, only for grouping and some unusual things like array access

2011-10-11T17:47:39  <j3camero> I am about to have that meeting with Google folks.
2011-10-11T17:48:36  <j3camero> The agenda is basically this: (1) can we use the name Google AI Challenge, (2) can we have $2000 or possible more to cover the cost of renting servers, (3) discussing the future of the contest and its relationship with Google.
2011-10-11T17:48:43  <j3camero> Will report back after or during.
2011-10-11T17:49:00  <j3camero> If anybody has any questions they want me to relay during the meeting, speak now.
2011-10-11T17:49:24  <Zannick> whoa, that's actually happening, sweet
2011-10-11T17:50:55  <j3camero> Haha yeah. Finally.
2011-10-11T17:51:05  <j3camero> I take all the blame for neglecting this hehe.

2011-10-11T17:56:18  <Zannick> i wonder how many googlers we have here

2011-10-11T18:34:41  <McLeopold> j3camero: so, is the meeting over?
2011-10-11T18:35:25  <j3camero> Yup, just ended.
2011-10-11T18:36:07  <McLeopold> how did it go?
2011-10-11T18:36:10  <Zannick> i hope that's not "ask about your involvement" in a bad way
2011-10-11T18:36:20  <j3camero> Haha no.
2011-10-11T18:36:27  <Zannick> :)
2011-10-11T18:36:49  <j3camero> They are just looking to build bridges internally with all the folks who are involved. MAybe create a mailing list or something. Not sure.
2011-10-11T18:36:50  <Zannick> the university programs people for my college are pretty chill
2011-10-11T18:37:07  <j3camero> They are all chill!
2011-10-11T18:37:14  <j3camero> Great people all around.
2011-10-11T18:37:20  <Zannick> i haven't met them all
2011-10-11T18:38:25  <j3camero> Neither have I. There has been a bit of turnover since I was last in Cali in person.
2011-10-11T18:39:18  <McLeopold> How many googlers did you meet with?
2011-10-11T18:40:36  <janzert1> are there any blockers from your side now for launching?

2011-10-11T18:42:35  <antimatroid> j3camero: so did it seem like it would be fine to continue using the Google name?
2011-10-11T18:42:49  <j3camero> McLeopold: just 1 this time. He was representing their whole University Programs team though.
2011-10-11T18:43:10  <j3camero> antimatroid: Yes and no.
2011-10-11T18:43:18  <antimatroid> :s
2011-10-11T18:43:27  <a1k0n> oh hey Zannick
2011-10-11T18:43:54  <Zannick> hey
2011-10-11T18:44:00  <McLeopold> so, that means there are hoops to jump through?
2011-10-11T18:44:14  <j3camero> So on point (1): can we use the name Google AI Challenge. There was some resistance to using the name Google AI Challenge because it implies that the event is being run and owned by Google. The suggestion was that we should call it "AI Challenge" with the subtitle "sponsored by Google". That's fine with me. Objections?

2011-10-11T18:45:04  <janzert> I've been thinking we should do that anyway
2011-10-11T18:45:23  <Zannick> a1k0n: the magic of irssi
2011-10-11T18:45:26  <janzert> it'll allow us to get other sub-sponsors easier as well
2011-10-11T18:45:31  <a1k0n> indeed.  i just saw my '3' turn red.
2011-10-11T18:45:38  <McLeopold> Does that imply sponsorship? :)
2011-10-11T18:45:54  <Zannick> j3camero: heh, the person you talked to is the supervisor of the person in charge of recruiting at my school (whom i know)
2011-10-11T18:45:55  <janzert> or at least less awkwardly
2011-10-11T18:46:17  <j3camero> Okay so people seem to be fine with the response to point (1). We're now called the AI Challenge, with the subtitle "sponsored by Google".
2011-10-11T18:46:41  <j3camero> That fits the new domain name that amstan bought anyways. ai-challenge.org.
2011-10-11T18:46:54  <McLeopold> without the dash, I believe
2011-10-11T18:46:54  <j3camero> sorry. aichalleng.org. No hyphen.
2011-10-11T18:47:03  <amstan> those dashes -.-

2011-10-11T18:47:39  <amstan> j3camero: what about sponsorship?
2011-10-11T18:47:54  <mcstar> $
2011-10-11T18:48:09  <j3camero> So on point (2): can we have money? There seemed to be a lot of support for funding. I didn't get a hard yes yet, but I am optimistic. We should know within a week at most.
2011-10-11T18:48:28  <amstan> j3camero: ok, but we can launch then?
2011-10-11T18:48:50  <mcstar> did they tell you this telepathically?
2011-10-11T18:49:10  <a1k0n> ssssssh, you can't talk about that
2011-10-11T18:49:14  <j3camero> This all has implications for the launch date. I agreed in the meeting to aim for November 1. But if that starts to slip, then we might as well do it January 15 or something.
2011-10-11T18:49:46  <McLeopold> what?
2011-10-11T18:49:50  <mcstar> gawd
2011-10-11T18:50:15  <a1k0n> i dunno, xmas break might be a good time for it
2011-10-11T18:50:30  <a1k0n> people won't feel as bad about procrastinating at work
2011-10-11T18:50:39  <janzert> whaa
2011-10-11T18:50:48  <McLeopold> we are giving way to much time to beta testers
2011-10-11T18:50:54  <mcstar> in the middle of the fall woudl have been the best time in my poninon
2011-10-11T18:50:59  <McLeopold> we ought to have launched last week already
2011-10-11T18:51:03  <mcstar> opinion*
2011-10-11T18:51:10  * janzert agrees
2011-10-11T18:51:13  <a1k0n> last week is the best time to do anything
2011-10-11T18:51:34  * Zannick remembers when the launch estimate was february
2011-10-11T18:51:39  <a1k0n> haha
2011-10-11T18:51:40  <mcstar> a1k0n: good for you, its always next week for me
2011-10-11T18:51:56  <j3camero> Agreed. But money. :-)
2011-10-11T18:52:06  <janzert> anyway I really can't pay for the beta server myself much longer so I'll need to go to a cheaper server or something soon

2011-10-11T18:52:34  <a1k0n> you could always launch on credit
2011-10-11T18:52:35  <McLeopold> we could just shut it down until launch?  Everything is ready

2011-10-11T18:53:56  <janzert> paypal might be easiest?
2011-10-11T18:53:56  <j3camero> And by send em a bill, I just mean tell me how much.
2011-10-11T18:54:15  <mcstar> ppl! McLeopold has a point, early testers will have a huge headstart
2011-10-11T18:54:19  <j3camero> Yeah paypal could work. Embarassingly enough, I ave never done that before. So you'll have to show me how.
2011-10-11T18:54:49  <a1k0n> well in that case, you're a perpretrator of fraud in paypal's view

2011-10-11T18:55:21  <j3camero> I see. If only we could fund this thing in Bitcoin...
2011-10-11T18:55:40  <janzert> :)
2011-10-11T18:55:59  <mcstar> janzert: :S
2011-10-11T18:56:25  <j3camero> Okay. Overall, there seemed to be a lot of support. The main bottleneck now is waiting to see if Google can put the server funding together on their end.
2011-10-11T18:56:30  *** okay is now known as okayzed
2011-10-11T18:56:47  <a1k0n> but it's hosted on EC2 right?
2011-10-11T18:57:09  <McLeopold> j3camero: so, what's the probability that they don't sponsor?  If we launched now, would that change things for Google?
2011-10-11T18:57:10  <j3camero> I haven't heard otherwise.
2011-10-11T18:57:10  <janzert> j3camero: it's at 88.85 so far for the month, if you can pay for it I don't mind waiting till the end of the month and I can let you know what it ran
2011-10-11T18:57:14  <janzert> a1k0n: es
2011-10-11T18:57:16  <janzert> yes
2011-10-11T18:57:37  <mcstar> janzert: how about in the title: Ai Challenge: Ants, onthe sidebar the ants logo, with 2011 fall, and somewhere in the main-title, with small fonts UNDER the title saying sponsored by google?
2011-10-11T18:58:03  <janzert> mcstar: that sponsored by google is actually suppose to be under the AI Challenge
2011-10-11T18:58:09  <mcstar> ah
2011-10-11T18:58:13  <janzert> it follows it in the html
2011-10-11T18:58:21  <janzert> something with the css must be bumping it up
2011-10-11T18:58:38  <j3camero> Oh, what's the beta server link again?
2011-10-11T18:58:48  <mcstar> @beta
2011-10-11T18:58:49  <contestbot> mcstar: beta could be http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/.
2011-10-11T18:59:04  <janzert> or antsbeta.janzert.com or beta.aichallenge.org
2011-10-11T18:59:10  <janzert> :)
2011-10-11T19:00:18  <j3camero> Sweet.
2011-10-11T19:00:25  <j3camero> So yeah. Now we wait.
2011-10-11T19:01:26  <McLeopold> j3camero: so, what's the probability that they don't sponsor?  If we launched now, would that change things for Google?
2011-10-11T19:02:09  <j3camero> I would feel better waiting until they tell me yes on funding, even if they haven't got the money to me yet.
2011-10-11T19:02:23  <j3camero> Otherwise there's the risk that we launch and I end up on the hook for a few grand.
2011-10-11T19:02:39  <janzert> anyone know why #header h1 has a "position: absolute;"?
2011-10-11T19:02:43  <McLeopold> If we launched now, would that change things for Google?
2011-10-11T19:02:51  <j3camero> How so?
2011-10-11T19:03:08  <McLeopold> Did they ask you to wait until they got back to you?
2011-10-11T19:03:19  <j3camero> It's implied yep.
2011-10-11T19:03:20  <janzert> hmm, I see it effects the background coloring
2011-10-11T19:03:42  <McLeopold> Did they give a hard date?
2011-10-11T19:03:46  <j3camero> We also talked about coordinating PR for the launch. So I would want to talk with Google a bit before picking a launch date.

2011-10-11T19:06:25  <janzert> not sure at this point we can do anything to mitigate the effect of people working on it before launch, so I think we just have to live with it. Sooner launch will in general be better of course :)

2011-10-11T19:11:05  <a1k0n> also, sponsored by Google?

2011-10-11T19:13:03  <McLeopold> j3camero: Could we use the logo?
2011-10-11T19:13:54  <janzert> do we really want a colored logo? I'd think probably not in the header at least, although it might be nice further down the page somewhere
2011-10-11T19:14:07  <j3camero> McLeopold, a1k0n: the use of the logo was actually suggested. That surprised me, since the logo was such a big deal in the past.
2011-10-11T19:14:12  <a1k0n> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Google-Logo.svg
2011-10-11T19:14:46  <McLeopold> Maybe we can get them to do one of those special holiday logos :)
2011-10-11T19:14:51  <antimatroid> i think changing it to sponsored by google might be better anyway (my opinion)
2011-10-11T19:14:57  <j3camero> janzert: you may be right. We should do whatever looks best and works best. But the use of the logo may not be forbidden, is all I'm saying.
2011-10-11T19:15:49  <Zannick> i'd be wary without explicit okay
2011-10-11T19:16:38  <jbroman> There is a single-colour logo resource as well.
2011-10-11T19:17:04  <jbroman> Which is appropriate in many cases (e.g. against coloured backgrounds).

2011-10-11T19:19:02  <jbroman> Also, glad to see the "sponsored by X" thing is catching on.

2011-10-11T19:19:16  <janzert> maybe make them red ants
2011-10-11T19:19:51  <_flag> Why don't you guys centre the title? It seems wierd all off to the side
2011-10-11T19:20:38  <janzert> I believe it's supposed to flow into the challenge game title "Ants"
2011-10-11T19:23:17  <McLeopold> j3camero: have you read the tutorials yet? http://beta.aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial.php
2011-10-11T19:23:35  <j3camero> I did yes.
2011-10-11T19:23:45  <j3camero> Oh wait no I havent seen this.
2011-10-11T19:23:47  <McLeopold> Any suggestions?
2011-10-11T19:24:09  <McLeopold> I'm planning to add a couple more languages soon
2011-10-11T19:24:17  <j3camero> Oh damn. Nice.
2011-10-11T19:24:30  <j3camero> There are so many next steps. That's what I'm talking about.
2011-10-11T19:24:49  <j3camero> Example games, everything. Damn.
2011-10-11T19:26:46  <jbroman> Anyhow, having Google in the subtitle also helps avoid confusion with initiatives like Google Code Jam.
2011-10-11T19:29:18  <McLeopold> My idea was to have a tab for main languages, then the basic tutorial would be the same.
2011-10-11T19:31:14  <j3camero> That's some fantastic work McLeopold. This will make it way easier for people to get started.

2011-10-11T19:33:24  <McLeopold> janzert: can you do a favicon while your playing with that stuff?
2011-10-11T19:33:44  <janzert> besides the ant we have?
2011-10-11T19:33:51  <a1k0n> wow dude
2011-10-11T19:33:51  <janzert> I'm not sure what else it should be
2011-10-11T19:34:05  <McLeopold> yeah, it's not the same ant as the logo right now
2011-10-11T19:34:16  <janzert> ahh
2011-10-11T19:34:29  <McLeopold> It's just something I copied from the internet
2011-10-11T19:34:47  <janzert> a1k0n: all I did was redden the base graphic up, whoever initially made it already had it slightly colored
2011-10-11T19:34:58  <a1k0n> heh cool
2011-10-11T19:35:08  <a1k0n> i didn't realize the logo was entirely done with css effects
2011-10-11T19:35:16  <a1k0n> (well besides the ants themselves)
2011-10-11T19:35:23  <McLeopold> I like the red, maybe a white or light green highlight on the word Ants now
2011-10-11T19:35:37  <a1k0n> the tutorial is great too
2011-10-11T19:35:52  <janzert> yeah, I think it needs a glow or drop shadow of some sort

2011-10-11T20:41:48  <amstan> janzert: while you're on that, can you also make the header height a little more
2011-10-11T20:41:50  <amstan> 150% more
2011-10-11T20:42:08  <amstan> it's too cramped right now, i don't think there's another website with a smaller header
2011-10-11T20:43:36  <janzert> news.ycombinator.com www.reddit.com slashdot.org news.google.com www.mint.com
2011-10-11T20:44:15  <janzert> www.amazon.com etc. :P
2011-10-11T20:45:11  <janzert> I think vertical space on a page is only becoming more important with the trends in wide screen displays
2011-10-11T20:45:22  <amstan> still
2011-10-11T20:45:26  <amstan> it's a little too small for my taste
2011-10-11T20:46:18  <janzert> we could shrink the text height if you think it's too cramped
2011-10-11T20:46:40  <janzert> the only part that feels a bit cramped to me is the area with the graphic and word Ants though
2011-10-11T20:47:11  <janzert> if we can get "Ants" to feel more like it is hovering above the graphic I think will help that
