2011-08-29T11:41:18  <mcstar> yeah, 2.7 is needed but as far as i know, the stable 3.1 is also supported
2011-08-29T11:41:54  <mcstar> what do you mean regarding foos spawning?
2011-08-29T11:41:57  <mcstar> s->d
2011-08-29T11:45:01  <delt0r> well what are the "parameters"
2011-08-29T11:45:14  <delt0r> ie is a random change per turn etc...

2011-08-29T11:45:38  <delt0r> It would be nice to be able to write a engine from spec rather than source...

2011-08-29T11:47:19  <mcstar> there are some ideas on the wiki of possible food spawning methods i believe
2011-08-29T11:47:30  <delt0r> i c
2011-08-29T11:47:31  <mcstar> but theres no clear specs on that
2011-08-29T11:47:43  <delt0r> so nothing final... hard to write it down in that case
2011-08-29T11:47:53  <mleise> new proposals for the neverending story? :D
2011-08-29T11:47:59  <delt0r> lol
2011-08-29T11:48:18  <delt0r> design by a committee without a chairman
2011-08-29T11:48:29  <mcstar> so delt0r are you writing a hwole new engine for the tcp server?
2011-08-29T11:48:42  <delt0r> more or less...
2011-08-29T11:48:54  <delt0r> it just fits with my stuff better
2011-08-29T11:49:05  <mcstar> i thought the corporate world didnt like code duplication
2011-08-29T11:49:06  <delt0r> don't forget this is the fun part for me
2011-08-29T11:49:11  <delt0r> they don't
2011-08-29T11:49:11  <mleise> i hope you thought enough about that decision. it is usually always better to reuse code
2011-08-29T11:49:22  <delt0r> hence why i now intend to never leave university
2011-08-29T11:49:31  <mcstar> :S
2011-08-29T11:49:37  <delt0r> Oh i did
2011-08-29T11:49:43  <mcstar> do you really want to drink beer in your whole life?
2011-08-29T11:49:57  <delt0r> ants is not exactly rocket science
2011-08-29T11:50:01  <mleise> *sigh* did I tell you what happened when I rewrote my boss' code?
2011-08-29T11:50:17  <delt0r> Ironically I use to make rockets
2011-08-29T11:50:18  <mcstar> the boss offered his job?
2011-08-29T11:50:40  <delt0r> ?
2011-08-29T11:50:43  <mleise> uh yes, that's what happened.
2011-08-29T11:50:49  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-29T11:50:49  <delt0r> oh
2011-08-29T11:50:50  <mcstar> really,
2011-08-29T11:50:53  <mcstar> ?
2011-08-29T11:51:11  <delt0r> well i turned down promotions a lot
2011-08-29T11:51:15  <mleise> of course not. I had to kneel and promise never to do such blasphemy again
2011-08-29T11:51:15  <delt0r> like to be cutting code
2011-08-29T11:51:21  <delt0r> not talking in meetings
2011-08-29T11:51:24  <mcstar> poor you
2011-08-29T11:51:41  <delt0r> was a contractor
2011-08-29T11:52:11  <delt0r> one companay they even gave me a "Dirty Contractor" badge
2011-08-29T11:52:26  <mcstar> delt0r: ants i better than rocket science, easier to test your bots than your rockets, and the game isnt really easy
2011-08-29T11:52:43  <delt0r> engine wise the game is easy
2011-08-29T11:52:49  <mcstar> i wrote one too
2011-08-29T11:52:50  <delt0r> ai wise not
2011-08-29T11:53:06  <mleise> especially the price for experimental material is cheaper in ants than rocket science
2011-08-29T11:53:09  <delt0r> I wrote on of the first ones...
2011-08-29T11:53:21  <delt0r> yea--but rockets blow up when they don't work
2011-08-29T11:53:37  <mcstar> well, i didnt implement everything, i used it to write my bot parrallel with it
2011-08-29T11:53:38  <delt0r> which is more fun that seg fault or null pointer
2011-08-29T11:53:52  <mleise> anyway I find it interesting that 'rocket science' is an idiom in the english speaking world. i don't know anything similar in continental europe
2011-08-29T11:54:00  <delt0r> but basically i am wrting JAntManager
2011-08-29T11:54:16  <delt0r> that needs its own engine
2011-08-29T11:54:30  <mcstar> mleise: brain surgeon?
2011-08-29T11:54:46  <mcstar> i think we say that in hungarian, agysebesz
2011-08-29T11:54:48  <mleise> no, doesn't ring a bell
2011-08-29T11:54:58  <mcstar> ok
2011-08-29T11:55:02  <mleise> maybe nuclear physics
2011-08-29T11:55:14  <mcstar> nah
2011-08-29T11:55:15  <delt0r> mleise: I find that at least german has a similar idom to any english one with they same meaning --more or less
2011-08-29T11:55:36  <delt0r> ie where have you been, living under a rock
2011-08-29T11:55:51  <delt0r> the german is something like living on the other side of the moon
2011-08-29T11:56:06  <mleise> delt0r: you are right, there is a smiliar one for almost everything, but not this particular one :D
2011-08-29T11:56:57  <mcstar> so , what is this jantmanager?
2011-08-29T11:57:05  <mleise> Ok, I'm off playing some WWII online shooter. So much for the dark side of the moon *evilgrin*. DoD is really fun though ;)
2011-08-29T11:57:23  <mcstar> i quit fsp
2011-08-29T11:58:50  <delt0r> mcstar: The jbotManager was very popular in the last challenge
2011-08-29T11:59:11  <delt0r> its just a tool to watch games, manage bots, and "spectate" games on tcp
2011-08-29T11:59:41  <delt0r> the last one had a manual play option as well.
2011-08-29T11:59:43  <mcstar> i see, a point and click interface for everything?
2011-08-29T11:59:49  <delt0r> more or less
2011-08-29T12:00:07  <mcstar> unclevasya did something like this
2011-08-29T12:00:17  <delt0r> there where several
2011-08-29T12:00:18  <mcstar> a gui for running games
2011-08-29T12:00:23  <mcstar> for this one
2011-08-29T12:00:27  <delt0r> C++ and .net ones
2011-08-29T12:00:39  <mcstar> he used delphi
2011-08-29T12:00:47  <mleise> Delphi rocks!
2011-08-29T12:00:49  <delt0r> mine was java so worked on more platforms and was easier to get going for the most part
2011-08-29T12:00:55  <mcstar> mleise: you are not here
2011-08-29T12:00:59  <mleise> right
2011-08-29T12:01:18  <mcstar> delt0r: what im saying is that he wrote that for this contest
2011-08-29T12:01:26  <delt0r> right
2011-08-29T12:01:38  <mcstar> did you take a look? or it doesnt matter
2011-08-29T12:01:43  <mcstar> you do that anyways
2011-08-29T12:01:45  <delt0r> link? they website does not seem to have anythting
2011-08-29T12:01:52  <mcstar> i think its in the forums
2011-08-29T12:02:15  <mcstar> i dont like the idea too much, and dont like gui's so never downloaded it
2011-08-29T12:02:19  <delt0r> is it platform specific... i don't have anything that has windows
2011-08-29T12:02:23  <mcstar> and its for windows only
2011-08-29T12:02:29  <delt0r> yea
2011-08-29T12:02:53  <delt0r> windows only is no fun...
2011-08-29T12:03:05  <delt0r> also my last one had a cmd line interface too
2011-08-29T12:03:19  <delt0r> for batch testing your bots.
2011-08-29T12:03:24  <delt0r> I used that quite a bit
2011-08-29T12:03:34  <mcstar> so did you get anywhere with the tcp server part in the weekend?
2011-08-29T12:03:42  <delt0r> but mostly i think it was used as a game perviewer...
2011-08-29T12:03:58  <delt0r> Started... not finished
2011-08-29T12:04:14  <delt0r> also this year the js game view is a lot more solid
2011-08-29T12:04:20  <delt0r> game viewer
2011-08-29T12:04:32  <mcstar> yeah, its pretty good
2011-08-29T12:05:25  <mcstar> so, its gonna take some time for you to make the server if you make your own engine
2011-08-29T12:05:27  <delt0r> so i think such a tool will be used less... but meh...
2011-08-29T12:05:39  <delt0r> its the easy part... the bot is the hard part
2011-08-29T12:05:43  <mcstar> hope contest wont start until youre done
2011-08-29T12:06:13  <mcstar> well, the whole engine is not an easy task to write
2011-08-29T12:06:21  <delt0r> mcstar: not really...Last weekend ended up at the pub untill 5am
2011-08-29T12:06:22  <mcstar> it took quite some time for mcleopold
2011-08-29T12:06:27  <delt0r> didn't get much code done
2011-08-29T12:06:55  <delt0r> a few weekends should be enough
2011-08-29T12:07:35  <delt0r> of course I could just write a generic server that takes a cmd line for a engine
2011-08-29T12:07:53  <delt0r> but then i should use phython
2011-08-29T12:07:56  <mcstar> the biggest problem, why the contest hasnt started yet, is because key people dont have enough time to spend with the engine/trueskill
2011-08-29T12:08:05  <delt0r> yea
2011-08-29T12:08:12  <delt0r> looked at true skill
2011-08-29T12:08:12  <mcstar> so you will make quite a lot of effort to duplicate their work
2011-08-29T12:08:36  <mcstar> but the contest could be started sooner if you for example concentrated on issues at hand
2011-08-29T12:08:54  <delt0r> mcstar: Really the engine is not that complicated --I already wrote one when folks were only talking ants
2011-08-29T12:08:55  <mcstar> its python
2011-08-29T12:09:01  <mcstar> not phython
2011-08-29T12:09:03  <mcstar> lol
2011-08-29T12:09:36  <mcstar> yeah, sure its your call
2011-08-29T12:10:11  <delt0r> a huge amount of the time has been spend *debating* not coding
2011-08-29T12:10:12  <mcstar> and yes, its still sommer, now i'd be better to start the contest when its colder
2011-08-29T12:10:15  <delt0r> spent
2011-08-29T12:10:24  <mcstar> o->u
2011-08-29T12:10:43  <mcstar> i hate typos
2011-08-29T12:11:20  <mcstar> im not decided on the matter to correct each and every one that i find or just leave them there
2011-08-29T12:12:32  <mcstar> im stuck with my bot, havent touched it in more than a month
2011-08-29T12:13:01  <mcstar> i tried some complicated things, i ended up makeing a snake-like bot
2011-08-29T12:13:35  <mcstar> but i think a succesfull bot needs to be simpler than mine, and should really utilize the board
2011-08-29T12:13:44  <delt0r> indeed
2011-08-29T12:13:48  <mcstar> now i have to exmplain what i mean by that
2011-08-29T12:14:09  <delt0r> there is some interesting strategy possibilities
2011-08-29T12:14:35  <mcstar> i think a lot of bots are board-based, ie, they look out for neigboring cells, check cell status and such
2011-08-29T12:14:42  <mcstar> mine started from a higher level
2011-08-29T12:14:58  <delt0r> Mine is global ...
2011-08-29T12:15:03  <mcstar> i have a fsm in it, that makes snakes, and has a recursive resolver logic
2011-08-29T12:15:17  <delt0r> see
2011-08-29T12:15:28  <delt0r> already more complicated than a simple engine
2011-08-29T12:15:30  <delt0r> :D
2011-08-29T12:15:32  <mcstar> plus it uses the hungarian algorithm(perfect matching) and a* path finding
2011-08-29T12:15:51  <delt0r> I only have local a*
2011-08-29T12:16:07  <mcstar> but all in all it makes some mistakes, and its hard to debug
2011-08-29T12:16:16  <mcstar> so im thinking of a complete new bot
2011-08-29T12:16:23  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@99-162-151-97.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Quit: bhasker)
2011-08-29T12:16:51  <mcstar> honestly, i thought about changing my languge
2011-08-29T12:16:58  <mcstar> but dont tell this to anyone
2011-08-29T12:17:28  <delt0r> what are you using?
2011-08-29T12:17:33  <mcstar> cl
2011-08-29T12:17:54  <mcstar> but if a board based logic is really succefull, then im considering c/c++
2011-08-29T12:18:15  *** ibdknox <ibdknox!~ibdknox@c-98-210-192-192.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-29T12:18:17  <mcstar> the problem with lisp, is that you can make what you want
2011-08-29T12:18:21  <delt0r> god i hate c/c++
2011-08-29T12:18:37  <mcstar> but sometimes what i want, turns out complicated
2011-08-29T12:18:37  <delt0r> Had to use em a lot
2011-08-29T12:18:57  <delt0r> but still don't like em... in fact i like some asm better
2011-08-29T12:19:04  <mcstar> hm
2011-08-29T12:19:09  <mcstar> i only read about asm
2011-08-29T12:19:10  <delt0r> but hay
2011-08-29T12:19:11  <mcstar> never used it
2011-08-29T12:19:16  <delt0r> whatever ...
2011-08-29T12:19:24  <mcstar> huh?
2011-08-29T12:19:29  <delt0r> dont' really get into lang wars
2011-08-29T12:19:47  <delt0r> never understood why some take it so personally
2011-08-29T12:19:50  <mcstar> i dont like the smell of napalm in the morning either
2011-08-29T12:20:29  <delt0r> mmmm
2011-08-29T12:20:32  <mcstar> trust me, im not going into flame wars over this matter
2011-08-29T12:20:32  <delt0r> napalm
2011-08-29T12:20:47  <delt0r> they call it something else
2011-08-29T12:20:48  <delt0r> now
2011-08-29T12:21:02  <delt0r> so then they can say "we are not using napalm"
2011-08-29T12:21:18  <mcstar> its a quote from apocalypse now
2011-08-29T12:21:25  <delt0r> I know
2011-08-29T12:21:32  <delt0r> my brothers fav movie
2011-08-29T12:21:50  <delt0r> "your either surfing, or your fighting"
2011-08-29T12:21:57  <mcstar> ah, ok, i want sure if i remembered it correctly, ive seen it long ago
2011-08-29T12:23:28  <mcstar> so, what lang. do you indend to use?
2011-08-29T12:23:31  <mcstar> t
2011-08-29T12:23:40  <delt0r> tend to use java a lot
2011-08-29T12:23:48  <delt0r> but i would love to use more lisp
2011-08-29T12:23:49  <mcstar> so for the bot too
2011-08-29T12:23:54  <delt0r> yea
2011-08-29T12:24:05  <delt0r> just don't have time for anything else
2011-08-29T12:24:17  <delt0r> I know java --and its api pretty well now
2011-08-29T12:24:30  <mcstar> sure, use what you know best
2011-08-29T12:24:31  <delt0r> all my work stuff is in right now
2011-08-29T12:24:43  <delt0r> well ironically i don't really like java
2011-08-29T12:24:51  <delt0r> just like it more than c/c++
2011-08-29T12:25:18  <delt0r> and i need to support Sun/linux/mac/windows
2011-08-29T12:25:43  <delt0r> also if you don't write it wrong, performance can be pretty good too
2011-08-29T12:25:58  <delt0r> but then that goes for a lot of langs
2011-08-29T12:26:09  <mcstar> yeah, i was surprised when i saw benchmarks, java was pretty damn fast
2011-08-29T12:26:24  <delt0r> my current code replaces some C
2011-08-29T12:26:29  <delt0r> is more than 5x faster
2011-08-29T12:26:55  <mcstar> but im a scientist, so im not really interested in corporate languages, and i can choose whatever i want
2011-08-29T12:26:57  <delt0r> but then if someone sees a slow java program --they think its java
2011-08-29T12:27:10  <delt0r> if they see a slow C program, they know its the coder
2011-08-29T12:27:25  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-29T12:28:19  <delt0r> mcstar: me too -- and for a great many things, raw performance is not the limmiting factor
2011-08-29T12:28:22  <delt0r> dev time is
2011-08-29T12:28:31  <mcstar> for simulations we use c, obviously, fortran could be a choice, but im not going to learn it
2011-08-29T12:28:44  <delt0r> fortan should die
2011-08-29T12:28:50  <delt0r> ;)
2011-08-29T12:28:50  <mcstar> maybe
2011-08-29T12:28:58  <mcstar> im not against it
2011-08-29T12:29:16  <delt0r> bleh -- only physics folks use nowdays
2011-08-29T12:29:18  <mcstar> but form a small exposition, i made up my mind that i dont like it
2011-08-29T12:29:26  <mcstar> that would fit
2011-08-29T12:29:30  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-29T12:29:36  <delt0r> well its stuck in 1965
2011-08-29T12:29:42  <mcstar> but its fast
2011-08-29T12:29:46  <delt0r> and even lisp was already ahead of the curve
2011-08-29T12:29:49  <mcstar> has cuda support
2011-08-29T12:29:51  <delt0r> so is asm
2011-08-29T12:30:04  <mcstar> has hpc capabilities
2011-08-29T12:30:06  <delt0r> that is not enough IMO
2011-08-29T12:30:29  <mcstar> i dont think its a beautiful language
2011-08-29T12:30:35  <delt0r> just about everything has hpc
2011-08-29T12:30:57  <delt0r> i have a 500 core cluster here
2011-08-29T12:31:12  <delt0r> and 2 more 250+ core cluster at other campuses i can use
2011-08-29T12:31:17  <mcstar> we have couple of 200's
2011-08-29T12:31:22  <mcstar> and teslas and fermis
2011-08-29T12:31:22  <delt0r> I use java and --c
2011-08-29T12:31:30  <delt0r> yea we have those too
2011-08-29T12:31:44  <delt0r> but i am out of the loop now... was one of my students
2011-08-29T12:32:02  <delt0r> good if the problem fits the hardware
2011-08-29T12:32:08  <mcstar> i just wrote a software that runs 120-140 times faster on a c1060 than on a single core
2011-08-29T12:32:18  <delt0r> not convinced about the longevity however
2011-08-29T12:32:33  <mcstar> longevity of what?
2011-08-29T12:32:46  <delt0r> GPU type processing
2011-08-29T12:32:56  <mcstar> well, it amazing
2011-08-29T12:32:58  <mcstar> s
2011-08-29T12:33:03  <mcstar> really
2011-08-29T12:33:05  <delt0r> when you have CPU with 16+ core
2011-08-29T12:33:25  <mcstar> its still gonna be faster for number crunching
2011-08-29T12:33:26  <delt0r> not convinced it will last... think general process will "catch up"
2011-08-29T12:33:32  <mcstar> no
2011-08-29T12:33:33  <mcstar> it cant
2011-08-29T12:33:40  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-29T12:33:49  <delt0r> yea--that is what everyone said about RISC 10 years ago
2011-08-29T12:34:05  <mcstar> just imagine that if general can be better, so can specialized units too
2011-08-29T12:34:21  <delt0r> but for such a narrow range of problems
2011-08-29T12:34:29  <delt0r> that is the problem...
2011-08-29T12:34:47  <mcstar> i mean, in some applications we really need fast arithmetic, and we dont want generic processing, this will stay the same
2011-08-29T12:34:53  <delt0r> so a 500+ core cluster is more flexable and hence a better investment for a department.
2011-08-29T12:35:35  <mcstar> it really depends on the problem
2011-08-29T12:35:36  <delt0r> and once the GPU market shifts to more generic cores, there will not be the economies of scale
2011-08-29T12:35:43  <delt0r> So i remain unconvinced...
2011-08-29T12:35:51  <delt0r> I do think that right now it works well
2011-08-29T12:36:19  <mcstar> thats enough, in the worst case, this arhitecture will pave the way for many-core precessing in genela
2011-08-29T12:36:22  <mcstar> general
2011-08-29T12:36:26  <delt0r> we see about a 10-50x speed up
2011-08-29T12:36:28  <mcstar> i mean people will get used to it
2011-08-29T12:36:51  <delt0r> well i was doing multicore coding more than 12 years ago
2011-08-29T12:37:04  <mcstar> with mpi?
2011-08-29T12:37:05  <delt0r> the conection machine is more than 20 years old IIRC
2011-08-29T12:37:18  <delt0r> VP whatever
2011-08-29T12:37:22  <delt0r> the other one
2011-08-29T12:37:25  <delt0r> on SGI
2011-08-29T12:37:27  <mcstar> openmp?
2011-08-29T12:37:45  <delt0r> no
2011-08-29T12:37:53  <mcstar> well, im not that old
2011-08-29T12:38:31  <mcstar> imagine, that these gpu's will have integrated network controllers
2011-08-29T12:38:40  <mcstar> maybe a cpu integrated in them too
2011-08-29T12:38:51  <mcstar> i think theres some research in this direction
2011-08-29T12:39:02  <mcstar> when you conntect those together
2011-08-29T12:39:21  <delt0r> there has been a lot of work on this sort of thing
2011-08-29T12:39:23  <mcstar> the arithemtic density will increse, and will beat cpu clasters more
2011-08-29T12:39:25  <delt0r> a *lot*
2011-08-29T12:39:35  <mcstar> u
2011-08-29T12:39:50  <delt0r> also with faster clocking things change a lot
2011-08-29T12:40:12  <delt0r> ie feeding --or distance signals travel dominate performance
2011-08-29T12:40:12  <mcstar> explain
2011-08-29T12:40:27  <delt0r> right now density is limited by heat disipation
2011-08-29T12:40:49  <mcstar> well, yeah, signal travels with finite speed
2011-08-29T12:41:01  <delt0r> in 1ns (1GHz) light can only travel ~30cm...
2011-08-29T12:41:06  <mcstar> but then you can imagine a 3d semiconductor structure
2011-08-29T12:41:22  <delt0r> the signal travels quite a bit slower than that...
2011-08-29T12:41:30  <delt0r> about 2-3times slower
2011-08-29T12:41:33  <delt0r> IIRC
2011-08-29T12:41:58  <delt0r> mcstar: we would have 3d by now if you could get rid of the heat
2011-08-29T12:42:02  <delt0r> but we can't
2011-08-29T12:42:16  <mcstar> well, they will
2011-08-29T12:42:30  <mcstar> obviously, the moore curve needs to be continued
2011-08-29T12:42:38  <delt0r> why?
2011-08-29T12:42:55  <mcstar> why not?
2011-08-29T12:43:00  <mcstar> it was true in the past
2011-08-29T12:43:04  <delt0r> we are at 20nm --that law only talks about component density
2011-08-29T12:43:06  <mcstar> i can only assume it will hold
2011-08-29T12:43:20  <delt0r> Past performance is no indication of future gains
2011-08-29T12:43:43  <delt0r> given that 20nm is about 400 atoms accross
2011-08-29T12:43:55  <delt0r> and clock cycles have not incressed
2011-08-29T12:43:55  <mcstar> obviously one can only extrapolate from the past
2011-08-29T12:44:11  <delt0r> we need some kind of "shift" like perhaps ... more cores
2011-08-29T12:44:29  <mcstar> well, we had that a couple of years ago
2011-08-29T12:44:58  <delt0r> yea--so now we have a data point that shows that  mMores law is not a given
2011-08-29T12:45:06  <mcstar> what?
2011-08-29T12:45:13  <delt0r> next is either better heat managment
2011-08-29T12:45:13  <mcstar> no, it still holds
2011-08-29T12:45:16  <delt0r> lol
2011-08-29T12:45:22  <delt0r> no it didn't
2011-08-29T12:45:36  <mcstar> yeah, it does hold
2011-08-29T12:46:23  <delt0r> whatever
2011-08-29T12:47:07  <mcstar> the really big breakthrough will be, when ohmic dissipations will be mimimized, or electron-based technology will be repalced with ligh/plasmons
2011-08-29T12:47:24  <mcstar> (excuse my typos)
2011-08-29T12:47:53  <mcstar> and then, maybe, 3d structures will be possbile
2011-08-29T12:48:06  *** berak <berak!~chatzilla@89.204.153.224> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [SeaMonkey 2.0a3/20090223135443])
2011-08-29T12:49:45  <mleise> mcstar: I worked with the author to make it run on wine
2011-08-29T12:50:05  <mleise> referring to "it only runs on windows" a few pages up
2011-08-29T12:50:19  <mcstar> do you mean the author of the car that runs on water?
2011-08-29T12:50:27  <mcstar> why do you want to put wine in it?
2011-08-29T12:50:45  <mcstar> ah, not the car then
2011-08-29T12:50:59  <mcstar> well, you see, im undereducated in these matters :)
2011-08-29T12:51:38  <mcstar> or, maybe, i lied, or i dont consider something running under wine something worth mentioning
2011-08-29T12:51:49  <mleise> Seriously, he write the app in Delphi as a programming beginner I suspect and Delphi produces Windows binaries only. So I helped him make it work on Linux, because he was well aware that his program would be of little use when most of use use Linux
2011-08-29T12:51:54  <mleise> *wrote
2011-08-29T12:53:03  <mcstar> so mleise what's your take on the future of computing?
2011-08-29T12:53:04  <mleise> I had no more problems with it since then. You give it the tools directory on your disk and select the bots and maps from a combo box
2011-08-29T12:54:09  <mleise> Looks like Google is driving the whole industry somewhat. So we will see proprietary software like Word run in browsers only in the future
2011-08-29T12:55:12  <mleise> Installation is far too complicated for users in the future. They just browse to their app store, click on Word and have all the Web 2.0 integrated as well
2011-08-29T12:55:26  <mcstar> well, they cant take Tex away from us
2011-08-29T12:55:47  <mleise> Tex will be something for ubergeeks
2011-08-29T12:56:00  <mcstar> im wating for some super-duper computer virus to kill their brains
2011-08-29T12:56:02  <mleise> like any virtual console window
2011-08-29T12:56:23  <mcstar> mleise: but i meant hardware wise
2011-08-29T12:56:24  <mleise> omg he is a hacker! he has a black window with glyphs open!
2011-08-29T12:56:42  <mleise> oh i c. i have no idea yet. let me make up my mind quickly
2011-08-29T12:56:49  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-29T12:57:00  <mcstar> i think thats the attitude of god too
2011-08-29T12:57:00  <mleise> Raytracing chips for example.
2011-08-29T12:57:04  <mcstar> are you two friends?
2011-08-29T12:57:16  <mleise> lol, no we avoid each other
2011-08-29T12:57:36  <mleise> there cannot be two of us ... you know the story
2011-08-29T12:57:45  <mcstar> you expect that raytracers will replace rasterizers?
2011-08-29T12:57:54  <mcstar> yeah
2011-08-29T12:57:58  <mcstar> im a highlander too
2011-08-29T12:58:03  <mcstar> since grade 6
2011-08-29T12:58:38  <mleise> sure, we have seen wonderfull raytraced graphics for example in Myst IV - Revelation, that no rasterizer can really match in realtime
2011-08-29T12:59:07  <mcstar> so you are saying that with high-enough details the raytracer will be faster?
2011-08-29T12:59:15  <mleise> Especially reflections, soft shadows, refractions and that stuff
2011-08-29T13:00:03  <mcstar> but why does raytracing need special hardware?
2011-08-29T13:00:14  <mleise> hmm, the raytracer will create a new enthusiasm in real time graphics. it allows for other things to be fast. and people will soon want to see somthing new and inspiring
2011-08-29T13:00:30  <mcstar> aham
2011-08-29T13:00:35  <mleise> :D
2011-08-29T13:00:46  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-vrdlkbggsbdoymvx> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-29T13:00:47  <delt0r> even renderman stuff with serious offline rendering does not do 100% raytracing... but quite a bit of rastering
2011-08-29T13:01:12  <mleise> the current hardware is optimized for rasterizing pixels without going into 'depth'
2011-08-29T13:01:29  <delt0r> not for offline renders that use CPUs
2011-08-29T13:01:40  <mleise> delt0r: ok, at some point they all use texture maps
2011-08-29T13:02:04  <delt0r> Im not saying there won't be raytraceing
2011-08-29T13:02:17  <delt0r> just that it won't be *only* ray tracing
2011-08-29T13:02:44  <mleise> yeah maybe the switch will be slow and unintrusive, like AMD64
2011-08-29T13:02:49  <mcstar> current hardware is flexible enough to run raytracers
2011-08-29T13:02:52  <mleise> or IPv6
2011-08-29T13:02:59  <delt0r> lol
2011-08-29T13:03:29  <mleise> mcstar: but it could be so much faster with optimized hardware. It's really diffucult to raytrace in a pixel shader
2011-08-29T13:04:07  <mcstar> i believe you dont have to use the shader model, there are raytraving done in cuda for exmaple
2011-08-29T13:04:09  <delt0r> its also very inefficient. Current GPUs are set up for rasterization.
2011-08-29T13:04:14  <mleise> you need to backreference the whole scene practically. one texture / shader / light state for the current surface is not enough
2011-08-29T13:04:48  <delt0r> yea--mem access in a niave ray tracer is very poor... ie no locality
2011-08-29T13:05:10  <delt0r> but there are smarter ways that preserve locality but require more memory
2011-08-29T13:06:22  <mleise> The whole CPU/GPU/memory architecture is not well suited for raytracing I think. But I've seen some cool tech demos already :)
2011-08-29T13:06:35  <mcstar> i think the biggest inpact in gaming will be not so much the better details, but the level of immersion
2011-08-29T13:06:38  <mcstar> im
2011-08-29T13:07:32  <mleise> for me that is mostly how much FPS I have. Under 30 FPS and the immersion is mostly gone for me
2011-08-29T13:07:35  <mcstar> cheaper better vr helmets/whatever will be real cool, or a brain-machine interface (im dreaming of that)
2011-08-29T13:07:49  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-29T13:08:12  <mcstar> well, for an FPS, fps needs to be around 80 at least, from my experience
2011-08-29T13:08:16  <mleise> haha, we could save so much processing if we only had to feed the brain the data it requires
2011-08-29T13:09:06  <mleise> all these pixels in corners we don't look at
2011-08-29T13:09:21  <mcstar> yeah, but the whole scene will be much bigger
2011-08-29T13:09:29  <mcstar> so all in all you dont really save anything
2011-08-29T13:09:49  <mcstar> and the resolution will be required to be higher
2011-08-29T13:10:29  <mcstar> but even a not-so-good-looking game will be totally different and enjoyable if you are able to fully immerse in it
2011-08-29T13:10:50  <mcstar> that will cause some serious game addictions in the future
2011-08-29T13:11:07  <mcstar> i think ill be a future vr junky
2011-08-29T13:11:11  <mcstar> or junkie
2011-08-29T13:11:18  <mleise> hehe, remember that kid that jumped out of the window when the tamagochi died?
2011-08-29T13:11:30  <mcstar> hardly
2011-08-29T13:11:34  <mcstar> it was long ago
2011-08-29T13:11:36  <mcstar> 10 years?
2011-08-29T13:11:40  <mleise> at least
2011-08-29T13:12:56  <mleise> I liked Silent Hill 2 for the well done cut scenes even if they lacked the facial expression capabilities of Half-Life 2 (that went mostly to waste in that game)
2011-08-29T13:13:30  <mcstar> ah, alyx
2011-08-29T13:14:18  <mleise> What else can we expect in computing? Less heat I guess, better batteries for notebooks and solar foils on the screen or the back
2011-08-29T13:14:57  <mcstar> i want a roll-up plastic sheet screen built in computer
2011-08-29T13:14:59  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@gmg154.internetdsl.tpnet.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-29T13:15:20  <mcstar> and big fing interactive boards
2011-08-29T13:15:27  <mcstar> you know what i mean?
2011-08-29T13:15:28  <mleise> Yeah Alyx and the Gman were well done, but that level of detail works better in an RPG where you spend more time talking to people
2011-08-29T13:16:12  <mleise> I know what you mean I think. Mission to Mars had these in one scene
2011-08-29T13:16:21  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-08-29T13:16:23  <mcstar> didnt see it

2011-08-29T13:17:04  <mcstar> basically a big screen, you can maipulate objects on it
2011-08-29T13:17:09  <mcstar> and write and stuff
2011-08-29T13:17:44  <mcstar> it good for thinking, you can walk, talk, write on it, its good
2011-08-29T13:18:14  <mcstar> a lot of people prefer blackboards to communicate ideas, or just to go over things
2011-08-29T13:18:36  <mcstar> its very handy, and an interactive blacboard would be even greater
2011-08-29T13:20:16  <mleise> ah no wrong movie, it was Red Planet: http://www.flashfilmworks.com/MovieGuide/RedPlanet/red06.jpg
2011-08-29T13:20:47  <mleise> I prefer my black board hanging on a wall
2011-08-29T13:21:31  <mcstar> pff
2011-08-29T13:21:34  <mleise> hey, there is IBM written on that thing, never noticed it
2011-08-29T13:21:43  <mcstar> i started downloading mission to mars
2011-08-29T13:22:35  <mcstar> red planet, is that when they found something on mars?
2011-08-29T13:22:41  <mcstar> theres some wind
2011-08-29T13:22:50  <mcstar> and something in the wind?
2011-08-29T13:23:14  <mleise> i think that is mission to mars
2011-08-29T13:23:30  <mcstar> hm
2011-08-29T13:23:33  <mcstar> im confused
2011-08-29T13:23:36  <mleise> red planet was with carrie-anne moss (trinity from matrix) and about the terraforming of mars
2011-08-29T13:23:41  <mcstar> i think i saw red planet, but not mission to mars
2011-08-29T13:24:01  <mcstar> i know who is carrie and moss
2011-08-29T13:24:06  <mleise> unfortunately thay had to take that stupid AI robot dog with them (looks much like dog from HL2)
2011-08-29T13:24:23  <mcstar> im a was matricised very early
2011-08-29T13:24:40  <mcstar> wth, im gonna watch both
2011-08-29T13:25:05  <mcstar> i was looking for sci-fi, i watched sunshine yesterday
2011-08-29T13:25:26  <mcstar> i have some time, and want to enjoy a couple of movies
2011-08-29T13:25:34  <mleise> I had a Jurassic Park flash back recently and loaded some of the old franchise games
2011-08-29T13:27:02  <mcstar> oh
2011-08-29T13:27:23  <mcstar> i remember how everyone was crazy about jurassic park
2011-08-29T13:27:30  <mcstar> i still dont get that movie
2011-08-29T13:27:30  <mleise> Operation Genesis was a nice idea, but you have it played through quickly. Then you start doing stupid things like putting a Brachiosaur into a compound with 20 hungry Velociraptors
2011-08-29T13:27:50  <mcstar> aha
2011-08-29T13:28:09  <mcstar> sry mleise im not the man you want to talk to about dinos
2011-08-29T13:28:12  <mleise> What's wrong with the movie? It made dinosaurs live up in a nice mix of science and action.
2011-08-29T13:28:34  <mcstar> i think i totally dont  care and not moved by the idea
2011-08-29T13:28:41  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-29T13:28:49  <mleise> fascinating ^^
2011-08-29T13:31:20  <mleise> It is a bit like talking about the future of computing. How can such big animals have slept? Did they sleep at all? Could they lie on the side without crushing their ribs under their weight
2011-08-29T13:31:56  <mleise> These are the 'corner cases' of evolution. The biggest things that ever walked the earth.
2011-08-29T13:31:56  <mcstar> the really big ones lived in water didnt they?
2011-08-29T13:32:16  <mcstar> the smaller the brain, the less sleep htey need
2011-08-29T13:32:20  <mleise> *sigh* I see I have to start at zero with you
2011-08-29T13:32:35  <mcstar> :S
2011-08-29T13:32:52  <mcstar> what did i say?
2011-08-29T13:33:10  <mleise> There were big water dinsoaurs, yes. But Brachiosaur for example ate leaves
2011-08-29T13:34:11  <mleise> There is one carnivore that lived in the water mostly: Spinosaur
2011-08-29T13:34:59  <mcstar> they werent really big
2011-08-29T13:35:26  <mleise> They analysed the mix of oxigen isotopes and found out that it would be untypical for a land animal
2011-08-29T13:35:27  <mcstar> its not like in star wars, in phantom menace those underwater things on nabu
2011-08-29T13:36:10  <mleise> so what dinosaur do you think of?
2011-08-29T13:36:21  <mcstar> i usually dont think of any
2011-08-29T13:36:41  <mleise> btw: Velociraptor was probably half the size of a human and had feathers. Take that Jurassic Park!
2011-08-29T13:37:01  <mcstar> what? was it bigger in JP?
2011-08-29T13:37:23  <mleise> http://sanela.info/ext/wp/sanela/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Doug-Henderson-Plesiosaur.jpg
2011-08-29T13:37:43  <mleise> I think in JP they could look you in the eyes, no?
2011-08-29T13:37:55  <mcstar> how would i know?
2011-08-29T13:38:34  <mleise> i help you: http://popcultureasylum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jurassic_kitchen_raptor.jpg
2011-08-29T13:38:41  <mcstar> i only remmber the guy's face he looked really terrified
2011-08-29T13:38:45  <mleise> damn they still look scary
2011-08-29T13:39:29  <mleise> I remember a scene where they climbed a letter to escape the restaurant and a raptor jumped up trying to grab one kids leg
2011-08-29T13:39:47  <mcstar> im more of a terminator/aliens guys
2011-08-29T13:39:50  <janzert1> http://www.gavinrymill.com/dinosaurs/jurassic-park-velociraptor.html
2011-08-29T13:39:57  <mcstar> -s
2011-08-29T13:40:01  <mleise> half the cinema - honestly - was shocked and raised their leg to escape the raptor
2011-08-29T13:41:11  <mleise> janzert1: thank you very much for this wonderful page. I think I would have kicked raptors around for pleasure :)
2011-08-29T13:41:20  <mcstar> anyway, i dont have a problem with inappropriate sizes, it would still kill any human
2011-08-29T13:41:25  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-08-29T13:41:30  <mcstar> take a dog, if your not careful it will kill you
2011-08-29T13:41:57  <mcstar> i mean, a dino doesnt need to be 3meters tall to be very dangerous
2011-08-29T13:42:31  <mcstar> it needs fast legs capable of jumping, a very strong neck, and a big jaw
2011-08-29T13:42:42  <mcstar> there you go, perfect predator
2011-08-29T13:42:49  <mleise> :'(
2011-08-29T13:44:15  <mcstar> anyway, what im recently more afraid of, are the small things
2011-08-29T13:44:27  <mleise> mosquitos?
2011-08-29T13:44:31  <mcstar> they are real, they are here, and are very very dangerous
2011-08-29T13:44:42  <mcstar> bacteria/viruses
2011-08-29T13:44:52  <mcstar> + human intervention, genetics
2011-08-29T13:45:01  <mcstar> + wrongful reasons
2011-08-29T13:45:12  <mleise> So you liked Resident Evil?
2011-08-29T13:45:22  <mcstar> thats good shit
2011-08-29T13:45:27  <mcstar> i dont like it
2011-08-29T13:45:33  <mcstar> i mean its a good watch
2011-08-29T13:46:04  <mcstar> i dont think i every wathched any of them again
2011-08-29T13:46:09  <mleise> These kind of movies are meant to be a warning to set limits to what we do in genetic experiments
2011-08-29T13:46:11  <mcstar> maybe i will sometime
2011-08-29T13:46:40  <mleise> or picking up what the society fears
2011-08-29T13:46:49  <mcstar> so, you recommended me 2 movies, let me recommend you a series
2011-08-29T13:46:59  <mcstar> ReGenesis
2011-08-29T13:47:10  *** Apophis <Apophis!~apophis@217-162-209-17.dynamic.hispeed.ch> has quit IRC (Quit: Verlassend)

2011-08-29T13:47:23  <mcstar> im watching it for the second time, i watched it a year ago for the first time
2011-08-29T13:47:33  <mcstar> its a canadian series, run for 4 seasons

2011-08-29T13:48:21  <mcstar> hm, what can i say
2011-08-29T13:49:19  <mcstar> yeah, i think wikipedia has a nice page of regenesis
2011-08-29T13:49:31  <mcstar> maybe read that, its better than me trying to describe it
2011-08-29T13:49:54  <mleise> oh i should have read the english wikipedia
2011-08-29T13:49:59  <mcstar> what i can say, is that i really enjoyed it, the matters they are dealing with could be happening right now
2011-08-29T13:51:04  <mcstar> i think only the first paragraph is of importance

2011-08-29T13:53:10  <delt0r> are the attack and spawn ranges expect to change much?
2011-08-29T13:53:22  <mleise> Well, are there people in black suits claiming you seeded proprietary corn from a big company and they will sue you till you lose your property?
2011-08-29T13:53:34  <delt0r> by much i mean say similar to visibility ranges
2011-08-29T13:53:37  <mleise> lol, that was not directed at you delt0r
2011-08-29T13:54:04  <delt0r> I didn't think you were
2011-08-29T13:54:23  <delt0r> s/expect/expected
2011-08-29T13:54:38  <mcstar> yeah, but if wasnt directed at delt0r , than to whom was it directed?
2011-08-29T13:55:10  <mcstar> i dont get that question out of the blue
2011-08-29T13:55:12  <mleise> to you mcstar about the things happening right now. there are lots of transgenic plants in canada
2011-08-29T13:55:19  <mcstar> aham
2011-08-29T13:55:30  <mleise> and people in black suits alway make a good sci-fi movie
2011-08-29T13:55:35  <mcstar> was this an incident?
2011-08-29T13:55:50  <mcstar> or do you make this up?
2011-08-29T13:56:21  <mleise> no this is real, i just omitted some details
2011-08-29T13:56:34  <delt0r> in the game of ants... is their the possibility that attack and spawn ranges increasing to be similar to vis range
2011-08-29T13:56:49  <mcstar> that'd be too much
2011-08-29T13:57:15  <mleise> spawn range similar to view range? no, that's not likely
2011-08-29T13:57:26  <mcstar> the attack radius changed becasue of blcoking issues caused by the old battle resoltuin method
2011-08-29T13:57:42  <mcstar> (to hell with my typos)
2011-08-29T13:57:57  <mcstar> delt0r: i think you dont want to hardcode them though
2011-08-29T13:58:04  <delt0r> I am not
2011-08-29T13:58:10  <delt0r> they are part of the game state
2011-08-29T13:58:30  <delt0r> just thinking about bad and good algos to find "visable" and stuff
2011-08-29T13:58:42  <mleise> *visible
2011-08-29T13:58:54  <mcstar> obviously, the orderig wont change, the viewradius will be always higher than the attack, which will be higher than the spawn radius
2011-08-29T13:59:25  <mleise> I use a lookup table with indices into the map for each radius
2011-08-29T13:59:32  <mcstar> and i dont see any reason for the spawnradis to change at all
2011-08-29T13:59:49  <mleise> so practically it is just a loop over an array to find all visible tiles.
2011-08-29T14:00:15  <mcstar> i had that part hard-coded
2011-08-29T14:00:26  <mleise> You can also mix that with tracking ant motions and only adding/removing tiles that went into/out of sight
2011-08-29T14:00:28  <mcstar> but it could be done with a macro
2011-08-29T14:00:45  <mcstar> mleise: thats how the engine does it
2011-08-29T14:00:47  <mcstar> right?
2011-08-29T14:00:55  <mcstar> mcloe talked about something like that
2011-08-29T14:01:24  <mleise> I don't know the details, but yes, he tracks the movement of ants to calculate visibility
2011-08-29T14:36:07  <mleise> mcstar: influenca viruses love paper money, so always pay electronically when it goes round to stay healthy ;)
2011-08-29T14:38:20  <mcstar> yeah, paper has a great many backteria/viruses
2011-08-29T14:38:44  <mcstar> but you see, those are quite common, we dont get sick form them
2011-08-29T14:40:42  <mcstar> you sure paper money has got influenza on it?
2011-08-29T14:41:13  <mcstar> i mean it could be, but i never heard of this particular virus being present on money
2011-08-29T14:43:17  <mcstar> wikipedia is really a great thing, its annoying that theres so much information that ill never know
2011-08-29T14:44:02  <mleise> hehe, well 10 days after a flu wave, I'm sure the viruses on the money are dead
2011-08-29T14:45:18  <mleise> But I am not so concerned about viruses as you are. Maybe after I watch ReGenesis. From the intro it looks like it is all about viruses/bacteria
2011-08-29T14:45:42  <mcstar> mostly
2011-08-29T14:45:55  <mcstar> are you gonna try it?
2011-08-29T14:46:08  <mcstar> at least watch the first episode, a two-parter :)

2011-08-29T14:56:07  <mleise> mcstar: from what i see on youtube it reminds me a lot of the drama in battlestar galactica
2011-08-29T14:56:20  <mleise> especially: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwb-ZNPzae0&feature=related
2011-08-29T14:56:48  <mleise> sounds like "you are a cylon, we can prove it" "no! you lie!"
2011-08-29T14:58:29  <mleise> maybe I'll have a look at the first episodes and see if i like it. from wikipedia it looks like season 3 and 4 haven't aired yet on arte (germany/france)
2011-08-29T14:58:56  <mleise> do they synchronise or subtitle in hungary?
2011-08-29T15:02:39  <mcstar> mleise: i have no idea
2011-08-29T15:02:46  <mcstar> i watch with original sound
2011-08-29T15:02:52  <mcstar> basically everything
2011-08-29T15:03:19  <mcstar> there are a couple movies that are hun. dubbed that i have
2011-08-29T15:03:24  <mcstar> from my childhood
2011-08-29T15:03:58  <mcstar> mleise: you should not have seen a clip from it :(
2011-08-29T15:04:14  <mleise> I try to get hold of versions in english+german with subtitles in both languages
2011-08-29T15:04:38  <mcstar> is  the show seeded at all?
2011-08-29T15:04:45  <mleise> mcstar: why should i not have seen a clip from it? was that a big spoiler with the miranda virus and the evil person creating a killer virus?
2011-08-29T15:04:55  <mcstar> ah yeah
2011-08-29T15:04:58  <mcstar> really
2011-08-29T15:05:06  <mcstar> and carolin's interrogation too
2011-08-29T15:05:22  <mleise> but ... but ... i wanted to see what the show is like
2011-08-29T15:05:37  <mcstar> ok i understand
2011-08-29T15:05:47  <mcstar> but flashplugin just ccrashed
2011-08-29T15:05:49  <mcstar> wtf
2011-08-29T15:07:19  <mcstar> anyway, that scene wont repeat itself, the show isnt about interrogation
2011-08-29T15:07:38  <mcstar> thats why it was good, caroline showed off some of her CIA background
2011-08-29T15:07:42  <mleise> no i ... had a look at other scenes too
2011-08-29T15:07:44  <mcstar> (i mean the scene)
2011-08-29T15:08:33  <mleise> wait who is caroline?
2011-08-29T15:08:50  <mcstar> the woman in the dress
2011-08-29T15:09:01  <mcstar> not the one behind the glass
2011-08-29T15:09:15  <mcstar> norbac's administrator
2011-08-29T15:09:19  <mleise> ok. i almost thought the woman behind the glass is hiding an even more complex story
2011-08-29T15:09:45  <mcstar> no, she is just a poor girl
2011-08-29T15:11:34  <mleise> anyway I don't know where to get the first season
2011-08-29T15:12:11  <mleise> except from amazon *g*
