2011-05-07T04:13:52  <antimatroid> i am
2011-05-07T04:13:56  <McLeopold> cool
2011-05-07T04:14:51  <McLeopold> do you know if amstan got the test server going?
2011-05-07T04:15:19  <antimatroid> no idea sorry
2011-05-07T04:15:28  <antimatroid> amstan_: ^^?
2011-05-07T04:15:46  <McLeopold> it's 4:15am for him, I doubt he's up
2011-05-07T04:16:00  <antimatroid> hehe fair enough
2011-05-07T04:17:06  <McLeopold> so, what's happening?
2011-05-07T04:17:36  <antimatroid> not sure sorry, i'm flat out with uni work :P
2011-05-07T04:17:48  <McLeopold> ah, ok
2011-05-07T04:17:54  <antimatroid> what have you been doing?
2011-05-07T04:18:05  <antimatroid> if i am needed to do something i can be summoned
2011-05-07T04:18:12  <McLeopold> nah
2011-05-07T04:18:12  <antimatroid> but otherwise i'm doing other stuff :P
2011-05-07T04:18:20  <McLeopold> I got the true skill updating
2011-05-07T04:18:29  <McLeopold> next is the ranking snapshots
2011-05-07T04:18:42  <antimatroid> is that for graphs?
2011-05-07T04:18:45  <McLeopold> but at this point we should have a working server where people can submit entries
2011-05-07T04:18:56  <antimatroid> tasty
2011-05-07T04:19:06  <McLeopold> mainly to get stats on how fast you are moving up or down
2011-05-07T04:19:40  <antimatroid> it would be cool if the server stored information about peoples relative place every x amount of time
2011-05-07T04:19:41  <McLeopold> what will be cool this time around is you can see how a single match effected your rank
2011-05-07T04:19:54  <McLeopold> yes, that's what the rankings table is for
2011-05-07T04:19:59  <antimatroid> so we can have the performance graphs on profile pages that were about for tron
2011-05-07T04:20:02  <antimatroid> :D
2011-05-07T04:20:13  <McLeopold> also, every game will show a before and after mu/sigma
2011-05-07T04:20:21  <antimatroid> cool
2011-05-07T04:20:36  <McLeopold> so, do we only have 1 map gen going?
2011-05-07T04:20:50  <antimatroid> you have a symmetric one yeah?
2011-05-07T04:20:53  <antimatroid> that's 2 symmetric ones
2011-05-07T04:21:01  <antimatroid> i will bust out the extra symmetry type at some point
2011-05-07T04:21:01  <McLeopold> when I finish it, yes
2011-05-07T04:21:12  <McLeopold> gotta get to beta first
2011-05-07T04:21:23  <antimatroid> we should aim to get those two extra ones ready for launch
2011-05-07T04:21:31  <McLeopold> yes, definately
2011-05-07T04:21:54  <McLeopold> can you tweak the current one to give each bot 2 starting spots and still keep your row/col uniqueness?
2011-05-07T04:22:10  <antimatroid> i think so
2011-05-07T04:22:16  <antimatroid> next to each other? or...
2011-05-07T04:22:25  <McLeopold> varied
2011-05-07T04:22:30  <antimatroid> how varied?
2011-05-07T04:22:36  <antimatroid> anywhere else on the map?
2011-05-07T04:22:47  <McLeopold> I want to make sure people see enough variety at the start to prevent them from assuming too much, like last time
2011-05-07T04:22:54  <antimatroid> yep okay
2011-05-07T04:23:20  <McLeopold> okay, one more thing

2011-05-07T04:23:36  <McLeopold> let's say you had 4 players...
2011-05-07T04:24:05  <McLeopold> if you did a bunch of 2 player matches, like a round robin, that would be 6 games
2011-05-07T04:24:28  <McLeopold> or you could have 6 regions on the map where the 2 start close to each other
2011-05-07T04:24:53  <McLeopold> what do you thing?
2011-05-07T04:24:55  <McLeopold> think
2011-05-07T04:25:04  <antimatroid> tile close matches so it all sort of runs at once?
2011-05-07T04:25:11  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-07T04:25:19  <antimatroid> each individual game will need to be quite small
2011-05-07T04:25:27  <McLeopold> if you win a local fight early, you get to help yourself with the others
2011-05-07T04:25:57  <antimatroid> the more variety with maps the better at the start i say
2011-05-07T04:26:02  <McLeopold> yep
2011-05-07T04:26:06  <antimatroid> but i'm not sure about them on first thoughts
2011-05-07T04:26:14  <antimatroid> but yeah, the more the merrier :P
2011-05-07T04:26:23  <McLeopold> well, if you have writers block with your uni stuff, try it out
2011-05-07T04:26:53  <McLeopold> I suppose it would be creating a 2 player small map, and then tiling it for each combination of 2 players
2011-05-07T04:27:39  <antimatroid> yep
2011-05-07T04:27:48  <antimatroid> but you need to make sure the global game is symmetric too
2011-05-07T04:28:02  <antimatroid> which might be a bit trickier
2011-05-07T04:28:07  <McLeopold> I'll let you solve that :p
2011-05-07T04:28:58  <antimatroid> i've been doing a physics class this semester (that was really hard to spell right then) and i'm playing around with it for thesis
2011-05-07T04:29:03  <antimatroid> so i'm all about symmetry this year
2011-05-07T04:29:07  <antimatroid> i wanted to spell it symester :P
2011-05-07T04:29:21  <McLeopold> how is physics and symmetry related?
2011-05-07T04:29:42  <antimatroid> exploiting symmetry makes things easier in some places
2011-05-07T04:29:47  <antimatroid> it's more a pure maths class than anything
2011-05-07T04:29:54  <antimatroid> but technically it's through the physics school
2011-05-07T04:30:49  <McLeopold> have you gone to 11.04 yet?
2011-05-07T04:30:58  <antimatroid> 11.04?
2011-05-07T04:31:02  <McLeopold> ubuntu
2011-05-07T04:31:05  <antimatroid> no
2011-05-07T04:31:12  <antimatroid> i'm lazy :P
2011-05-07T04:31:36  <McLeopold> I just click the "sure, why not" button and everything is working so far
2011-05-07T04:31:45  <McLeopold> I'm still getting used to the desktop

2011-05-07T22:35:49  <_flag> sigh: no, but in hindsight I probably should have been able to do it
2011-05-07T22:36:27  <sigh> _flag: then you'll kick yourself when you see how short the solution is
2011-05-07T22:36:52  <_flag> _flag: I already saw it and got depressed, thanks :)
2011-05-07T22:36:53  <sigh> oh, they have the solutosup
2011-05-07T22:37:13  <_flag> The people who solved all for in under an hour amaze me
2011-05-07T22:37:20  <_flag> s/for/four
2011-05-07T22:37:46  <_flag> That's how much time I spend reading over the questions and planning the thing :P
2011-05-07T22:38:18  <sigh> yeah, some people are quite fast
2011-05-07T22:38:41  <sigh> but the fast people will be much more experienced
2011-05-07T22:39:43  <_flag> Are there people who do these things regularly? Or do you just mean people who've been writing algorithmns for years?
2011-05-07T22:40:35  <sigh> there are people who do these things regularly... there are lots of places around which have coding problems
2011-05-07T22:41:00  <sigh> when it comes to the harder problems, it's not so much algorithms as it is maths
2011-05-07T22:41:32  <sigh> goro and candy are a good example of that
2011-05-07T22:41:48  <_flag> Yeah, for example I would have no clue how to begin doing goro
2011-05-07T22:42:54  <sigh> yeah, goro was much harder than the other questions
2011-05-07T22:44:05  <sigh> but again, the topics that goro covers, like permutations and probability would have been immediately obvious to people who had done some higher level maths
2011-05-07T22:44:15  <sigh> so for them it would have been just a matter of finding the proof
2011-05-07T22:44:35  <_flag> I haven't, so I'm at a disadvantage there

2011-05-07T23:03:43  <antimatroid> the acm contests deal with problems like these
2011-05-07T23:05:39  <amstan> ugh.. mcleopold's scripts..
2011-05-07T23:06:18  <sigh> is something wrong with them?
2011-05-07T23:06:32  <amstan> yes
2011-05-07T23:06:36  <amstan> they're broken

2011-05-07T23:11:57  <amstan> and he broke the php too on the index.php
2011-05-07T23:11:57  <computerwiz_222> i see that website isn't loading correctly anymore? http://hypertriangle.com:13080/
2011-05-07T23:12:04  <amstan> aka that ^
2011-05-07T23:12:43  <sigh> checkout a older version that works for now?
2011-05-07T23:12:54  <amstan> sigh: that's not the point though..
2011-05-07T23:13:14  <amstan> i really don't like that mcleopold is pushing all this untested code

2011-05-07T23:16:35  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Fixed a bunch of things, tried to get other stuff working, just fustrated in general
2011-05-07T23:16:35  <CIA-33> aichallenge: * completed server_info.py files SHOULD NOT be in the repository, added it to gitignore
2011-05-07T23:16:35  <CIA-33> aichallenge: * sql should contain only sql files, and integration testing should have stuff like create_test_data.py
2011-05-07T23:16:36  <CIA-33> aichallenge: * changed create_test_data to use the server_info.py file from manager/
2011-05-07T23:16:36  <CIA-33> aichallenge: * mysql is case sensitive, so stuff like USER will give errors if there's only lowercase user table. - http://bit.ly/kOmLVf
2011-05-07T23:16:36  <qacek> is there any documentation yet on the IO for the contest? I wanted to try my hand at writing a haskell starter bot. Should I just look at other bots to get a feel for the spec or is there something better?
2011-05-07T23:16:55  <amstan> qacek: yes, afaik there's a wiki page about it
2011-05-07T23:17:23  <amstan> qacek: but if you can't find it.. you might want to look at the other bots
2011-05-07T23:17:48  <qacek> amstan: thanks I forgot github had wiki
2011-05-07T23:18:00  <amstan> sigh: and that's why i'm fustrated with him..

2011-05-07T23:21:31  <amstan> sigh, janzert: have you guys ever used memcache? it seems like mcleopold made it a requirement for the index.php page, how can i set it up on a dev comp?
2011-05-07T23:22:24  <sigh> I haven't
2011-05-07T23:23:09  <amstan> it seems like all i had to do is aptget it
2011-05-07T23:23:11  <amstan> hopefully
