2010-11-06T00:01:47  <eburnette_> @hello
2010-11-06T00:01:48  <contestbot> eburnette_: I have no idea what you mean.
2010-11-06T00:02:37  <sigh> @hi
2010-11-06T00:02:37  <contestbot> hi sigh
2010-11-06T00:04:31  <eburnette_> Error323 what does your new version do differently?
2010-11-06T00:06:37  <eburnette_> Anybody else notice the visualizers don't look very good on the iPad?
2010-11-06T00:08:08  <Frontier> Well, what browser does the iPad use? The HTML visualiser depends on the browser.
2010-11-06T00:08:58  <Frontier> Safari might have a general drawing issue, like Opera.
2010-11-06T00:09:39  <sigh> Safari on my mac works fine
2010-11-06T00:09:44  <eburnette_> Webkit, like Safari
2010-11-06T00:10:49  <eburnette_> Also looks bad on Android 2.2 browser which is also based on Webkit
2010-11-06T00:10:55  <Frontier> Safari looks ok, but plain webkit doesn't?
2010-11-06T00:11:19  <eburnette_> I haven't tried iPhone or iPod touch browser
2010-11-06T00:11:48  <Frontier> sigh: My code that iterates "all" possible combinations just got faster. Yesterday I had some very good results with thinking for 3 minutes in the first turn. Now I have even better result in a second!
2010-11-06T00:12:21  <sigh> Frontier: cool :)
2010-11-06T00:12:29  <eburnette_> Yeah the numbers are flying over on the left, away from ship arrows
2010-11-06T00:12:41  <sigh> I still have trouble understanding your use of the word "all" even if it is in quotes :P
2010-11-06T00:13:15  <eburnette_> 23! == all?
2010-11-06T00:14:08  <demerzel_> ipad?  ansi-c x86 or gtfo
2010-11-06T00:14:25  <Frontier> exactly. i assume the enemy does nothing and take only planets that are closer to me than the enemy.
2010-11-06T00:15:01  <demerzel_> i am about to implement my first matrix calc
2010-11-06T00:15:09  <Frontier> some heuristics here, some correct exclusions there and in a second you have a result very close to the optimum
2010-11-06T00:15:19  <demerzel_> put the state through a massive battery of tests and its as bulletproof as i can think to test it for
2010-11-06T00:15:19  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4256), shangas(4130), dmj111(4078), george(4073), Xrillo(4041), Raschi(4010), felixcoto(4007), Accoun(4001), Slin-.-(3955), hutabhu(3949)
2010-11-06T00:15:50  <eburnette_> shangas is improving
2010-11-06T00:16:48  <Frontier> like: Give me a map name and I tell you how you can max out ships or production to turn 20. I think no bot can beat that now ^^.
2010-11-06T00:16:48  <demerzel_> actually speaking of the ipad i love that apple has pushed plain old c back into mainstream dev
2010-11-06T00:17:03  <eburnette_> Only 3-4 of top 10 were there a week ago, interesting
2010-11-06T00:17:07  <demerzel_> would get something to support that but beyond c i know nothing about macs

2010-11-06T00:18:12  <demerzel_> how iterative was your search
2010-11-06T00:18:27  <demerzel_> you can go to a lot deeper depths than 21! or even 11!
2010-11-06T00:19:39  <Frontier> eburnette_: give me a link to it ^^
2010-11-06T00:19:41  <eburnette_> Dang iterators are slow in Java, having timeout issues
2010-11-06T00:20:22  <eburnette_> Frontier, link to what?
2010-11-06T00:20:41  <eburnette_> Oh the map, I made it up :)
2010-11-06T00:20:52  <demerzel_> i have all the maps in  a db
2010-11-06T00:21:04  <Frontier> demerzel_: I searched 16651 states
2010-11-06T00:21:10  <demerzel_> per map?
2010-11-06T00:21:38  <eburnette_> tourney maps will be new though, won't they?
2010-11-06T00:21:39  <Frontier> that was the number for map4
2010-11-06T00:21:55  <demerzel_> eburnette_: i am kinda banking on that
2010-11-06T00:22:11  <demerzel_> eburnette_: but i'm a little worried tbh i am sure some people will have opening move sets
2010-11-06T00:22:15  <demerzel_> but i hope they do what is right
2010-11-06T00:22:39  <demerzel_> Frontier:  that number seems really low
2010-11-06T00:23:03  <Frontier> the best production I can get is using this path: (ships 287, growth 40) after 20 rounds:  0( 9) 8( 6)12( 7)13( 5)18(11)21( 4)20(14) 3(19)10(17) 6(15)15(16)
2010-11-06T00:23:19  <demerzel_> what's the number in front mean
2010-11-06T00:23:22  <demerzel_> planet 0?
2010-11-06T00:23:23  <Frontier> the numbers in () are the turn at which the planet is captures
2010-11-06T00:23:33  <eburnette_> I think I could spend an hour searching and not get too much deeper than I do with a second
2010-11-06T00:23:34  <Frontier> correct it is the planet id
2010-11-06T00:23:52  <demerzel_> hmm do you know of a game with that map
2010-11-06T00:24:02  <Frontier> demerzel_: That number seems low? :/
2010-11-06T00:24:08  <demerzel_> 16651?  yea
2010-11-06T00:24:10  <demerzel_> what lang you using
2010-11-06T00:24:14  <Frontier> c++
2010-11-06T00:24:16  <eburnette_> Yeah but why 20?
2010-11-06T00:24:57  <Frontier> 20 is just a number i made up, if i use 200 it will become really vague and who knows what the enemy will do in turns 20 to 200.
2010-11-06T00:25:01  <demerzel_> well there's a lot of factors
2010-11-06T00:25:34  <demerzel_> if i was just looking to maximize ships hmm i don't think i'd use a payoff
2010-11-06T00:25:35  <Frontier> the best ship count i can get to turn 20 is 431.
2010-11-06T00:25:47  <demerzel_> pastebin the map :0
2010-11-06T00:25:59  <eburnette_> I tried all from 1 to 50, picked the best, and mega1 just sent 100 to the center and clobbered me
2010-11-06T00:26:00  <Frontier> it is map4.txt
2010-11-06T00:26:00  <demerzel_> why wouldn't you go for max ship count
2010-11-06T00:26:31  <demerzel_> fix this: http://www.ai-contest.com/maps/map4.txt
2010-11-06T00:26:36  <demerzel_> can't remember where the maps are
2010-11-06T00:26:47  <demerzel_> i could get it out of my db but then i'd have to piece it together lol
2010-11-06T00:27:07  <Frontier> i am not familiar with pastebin
2010-11-06T00:27:09  <demerzel_> oh nm i still do have the starter package on my desktop
2010-11-06T00:27:13  <demerzel_> don't worry about it :)
2010-11-06T00:27:34  <Frontier> eburnette_: What do you mean by 1..50?
2010-11-06T00:27:35  <demerzel_> Frontier: why wouldn't you go for the max ships
2010-11-06T00:27:48  <eburnette_> Horizons
2010-11-06T00:28:16  <Frontier> because maybe the enemy is still far away, and i can spend more time capturing planets wich will be faster with a higher groth rate
2010-11-06T00:28:33  <demerzel_> yea but if you have 200 more ships you can just start taking the enemy planets?
2010-11-06T00:29:35  <demerzel_> i mean that's a pretty big diff
2010-11-06T00:29:38  <eburnette_> For maps try http://72.44.46.68/getmaps
2010-11-06T00:30:17  <eburnette_> Far away isn't all that far usually
2010-11-06T00:31:04  <Frontier> demerzel_: yeah at some point i have to take the enemy into consideration.  On map 4 i can have 144 ships difference on turn 20 that's right. Actually I should find out when I meet the enemy and try to maximise for ships to that point.
2010-11-06T00:31:22  <eburnette_> 17 or so avg? And you really only have half that before enemy gets to your side
2010-11-06T00:31:28  <demerzel_> yea you're planning on holding 0 on this map with 287 ships? http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=875024
2010-11-06T00:31:35  <demerzel_> no way
2010-11-06T00:31:54  <demerzel_> they're over 300 and that's with a -40 to both
2010-11-06T00:32:32  <Frontier> the game doesn't load
2010-11-06T00:32:38  <eburnette_> Too far away from support
2010-11-06T00:32:47  <demerzel_> hmm that's odd
2010-11-06T00:32:58  <demerzel_> crap man why does this stop autopaging
2010-11-06T00:33:02  <demerzel_> pissing me off
2010-11-06T00:34:28  <demerzel_> actually i'm glad you said something because i forgot i was going to calc out neutral acq differently
2010-11-06T00:34:44  <Frontier> i don't plan on holding anything that's the problem now. There is no active enemy right now in my code. I still like the way I can find some good starting moves now.
2010-11-06T00:34:58  <demerzel_> no that's cool
2010-11-06T00:35:04  <demerzel_> i would def not shoot for max growth though
2010-11-06T00:35:22  <demerzel_> that's like making moves based on turn 200 scores
2010-11-06T00:35:25  <demerzel_> might pan out but probably not

2010-11-06T00:37:11  <Frontier> but max ships can leave me behind on growth which is important when you get into a stale mate
2010-11-06T00:38:02  <eburnette_> Max both? Or play positionally.
2010-11-06T00:38:16  <demerzel_> my god that version number is nuts

2010-11-06T00:39:27  <eburnette_> Thought it was some game theory acronym
2010-11-06T00:40:07  <demerzel_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=875734
2010-11-06T00:41:02  <demerzel_> pretty sure that is the old #1 spanish guy
2010-11-06T00:41:13  <demerzel_> even if it is an acronym probably not an english one
2010-11-06T00:41:43  <Frontier> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=875582 is actually a good example! One bot tries to max out growth, while the other maxes out ships.
2010-11-06T00:41:55  <eburnette_> P0wnd:  http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=875640
2010-11-06T00:42:26  <demerzel_> Frontier: you misread that game
2010-11-06T00:42:35  <Frontier> :(
2010-11-06T00:42:46  <demerzel_> they were both going for max ships but the reason he won is because boc left that one planet unsupported
2010-11-06T00:43:57  <Frontier> hightime, almost played my solution for max growth to turn 10, that is why he lost. he didn't have the ships to defend
2010-11-06T00:43:59  <demerzel_> well you could also read it as boc tried to expand all 3 directions at once and had to concentrate on one and lost the other 2
2010-11-06T00:44:46  <eburnette_> Blue has more growth and more ships up to move 30
2010-11-06T00:44:46  <demerzel_> hightime?  what aer you looking at lol
2010-11-06T00:44:51  <demerzel_> you pasted the game eburnette did
2010-11-06T00:45:31  <eburnette_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=875582
2010-11-06T00:45:54  <demerzel_> yea boc vs CCCF 875582 - frontier said something about hightime
2010-11-06T00:46:26  <Frontier> I am referring to game_id=875582

2010-11-06T00:48:31  <Frontier> I just paste my solutions to turn 10 here quickly:
2010-11-06T00:48:34  <Frontier> (147 +26) after 10 rounds:  0( 9) 8( 6)12( 7)13( 5)15( 3)21( 4)

2010-11-06T00:48:34  <Frontier> (172 +24) after 10 rounds:  0( 9) 8( 6)13( 5)21( 4)

2010-11-06T00:49:17  <eburnette_> How do you read that
2010-11-06T00:49:52  <Frontier> (ships +growth) ...: planet_id(captured after n turns from start) ...
2010-11-06T00:50:59  <eburnette_> Hmm, the winner used none of those
2010-11-06T00:51:12  <Frontier> look at turn 1+10 = 11
2010-11-06T00:51:45  <Frontier> in other words, my turns start at 0 :o)
2010-11-06T00:52:59  <eburnette_> On the 582 game turn 11 shows 133 +9
2010-11-06T00:53:55  <Frontier> map 195... wait gotta download that from somewhere

2010-11-06T01:08:18  <Eburnette_> Maybe boc was saving them to take the corner planet, or defend from side attack?

2010-11-06T01:23:05  <sigh> Frontier... I think I have an idea what you are doing... I'm going to try it
2010-11-06T01:24:01  <Frontier> you... copy me? Oo
2010-11-06T01:24:26  <sigh> your optimal thingy
2010-11-06T01:24:51  <Frontier> I should have stayed quiet. Now before I get my bot running everyone implements my ideas. I need software patents!
2010-11-06T01:24:58  <sigh> haha
2010-11-06T01:25:10  <Frontier> but first of all.. tell me what you are trying to do :D
2010-11-06T01:25:15  <sigh> :P
2010-11-06T01:25:57  <sigh> Just that I have some idea of how you cut down the search so much... I don't know if it will work... which is why I'm going to try it
2010-11-06T01:26:30  <Frontier> uh... what exactly are you trying? O.o
2010-11-06T01:27:02  <sigh> optimal solution for capturing neutrals? isn't that what you were talking about?
2010-11-06T01:27:37  <Frontier> That's it, but what is your idea on cutting down the searches?
2010-11-06T01:28:05  <sigh> I'll keep quite about that for now :)
2010-11-06T01:28:14  <sigh> *quiet
2010-11-06T01:29:08  <Frontier> but you need someone to tell you that it wont work!

2010-11-06T01:29:30  <Codefun64> does anyone know what the prize for AI competition 2009 was?
2010-11-06T01:29:44  <Codefun64> any of them, if there were more than one?
2010-11-06T01:29:46  <Frontier> no really, I would have saved me a lot of trouble if i could have shared some of my ideas and someone said: "that cant work, because..."
2010-11-06T01:29:50  <sigh> ask a1k0n, he won the tron one
2010-11-06T01:30:06  <Codefun64> :O didn't know he was here, otherwise I would've
2010-11-06T01:30:22  <Codefun64> a1k0n, may I be so  bold as to ask what the prize for winning in 2009 was?
2010-11-06T01:31:39  <sigh> Frontier: nah, it's simple enough that I won't really feel that bad if it doesn't work out
2010-11-06T01:32:28  <Codefun64> Talking about sharing ideas? *steals everyone's ideas* ;)
2010-11-06T01:32:41  <Frontier> like "dont take planets that have more ships and less growth than closer ones"?
2010-11-06T01:33:06  <Codefun64> I'd say a more complicated technique should be used...
2010-11-06T01:33:21  <Codefun64> For more situations, and based on distance as well...
2010-11-06T01:33:23  <sigh> Frontier: nah, more sophisticated than that...
2010-11-06T01:33:57  <Codefun64> D'oh, *embarassed face* failed compilation.... What the heck?
2010-11-06T01:33:58  <sigh> Frontier: also, I'm not sure if that is a heuristic or if it is optimal
2010-11-06T01:34:10  <sigh> what you just said
2010-11-06T01:34:12  <Frontier> common, I gave you an inspiration. you can at least tell me what you are trying.
2010-11-06T01:34:49  <Codefun64> sharing the exact details of one's bot seems rather counter productive o_O
2010-11-06T01:35:27  <Codefun64> But that's just me....
2010-11-06T01:36:51  <sigh> Frontier: one of the main non-trivial parts is ordering the search to facilitate pruning
2010-11-06T01:38:11  <Frontier> sigh: that's right. i didn't care too much about that though.
2010-11-06T01:39:33  <Frontier> sigh: so you are searching for a perfect solution, right?
2010-11-06T01:39:43  <sigh> ideally, yeah
2010-11-06T01:39:48  <Codefun64> Well there comes a point in each bots life where they all become very similar, the only differences being in the equations themselves, rather than how they're executed.
2010-11-06T01:40:09  <sigh> the other "idea" was that you weren't actually searching 22! options, because you had a horizon
2010-11-06T01:40:24  <Codefun64> There are, obviously, more differences, but those other differences get less important as you improve the bot.
2010-11-06T01:40:25  <Frontier> a horizon in terms of a turn limit
2010-11-06T01:40:31  <sigh> that's just a realisation that it might be feasible
2010-11-06T01:41:24  <Frontier> Ah, this is so helpful: bool remove = turns > MAX_TURNS || ... || ... ;
2010-11-06T01:42:12  <sigh> yeah, fair enough... atm I just want to look at the start of the game
2010-11-06T01:42:54  <Codefun64> So building a bot based off of a known time constraint with which to win or lose?
2010-11-06T01:43:16  <Codefun64> Interesting.... but in my opinion not very artificially intelligent because it uses a preset parameter which is subject to change.
2010-11-06T01:43:24  <Frontier> Codefun64: No, I was limiting the search for a good solution to 20 turns
2010-11-06T01:43:59  <Frontier> in other words the limit is set to a point in time that can still be predicted with some accuracy.
2010-11-06T01:44:01  <Codefun64> Hilariously, I have no idea how to send a private message to someone on this thing.... How do I do that?
2010-11-06T01:44:12  <Frontier> "/msg name text"
2010-11-06T01:44:14  <sigh>  /msg
2010-11-06T01:44:19  <Codefun64> Ah thanks.

2010-11-06T01:46:29  <Codefun64> I wonder if it's possible to build an AI to produce a pattern the enemy follows and use that to it's advantage in the 1 second turn limit?
2010-11-06T01:46:42  <antimatroid1> grrr, it should be a crime to set exams on a saturday afternoon
2010-11-06T01:46:58  <Codefun64> Gotta love those evil professors :)

2010-11-06T01:47:08  <antimatroid1> wasn't her decision, she hated it too
2010-11-06T01:47:22  <sigh> lol, ignore the Codefun64
2010-11-06T01:47:45  <Codefun64> Well... evil university?
2010-11-06T01:47:49  <Frontier> Codefun64: You should try it. Look at what the bots do. Some stream constantly, some stream in bulks, some are very aggressive, some expand more
2010-11-06T01:48:21  <sigh> it's a tricky problem
2010-11-06T01:48:22  <antimatroid1> sigh: my uni treats saturday as an extra weekday during exams
2010-11-06T01:48:34  <antimatroid1> an analysis exam in the uni bar on a saturday afternoon, go figure aha
2010-11-06T01:48:40  <sigh> the main thing is that I really don't know the best way to counter each style
2010-11-06T01:48:50  <Frontier> I will try to tell how much a bot favors expansion at least, depending on which of my pseudo optimal solutions the enemy is following.
2010-11-06T01:48:55  <sigh> I mean in a way that I could tel my bot
2010-11-06T01:49:06  <antimatroid1> there was no prize for the last contest if that wasn't said
2010-11-06T01:49:19  <Codefun64> Really there's no way to counter every style if you hardcode it
2010-11-06T01:49:26  <antimatroid1> although i think there is *something* for this one, no idea how good it is
2010-11-06T01:49:32  <Codefun64> You need dynamic code for every situation
2010-11-06T01:49:36  <antimatroid1> having said that, it looks very good job wise to do well in such a contest
2010-11-06T01:49:51  <antimatroid1> Codefun64: trees take care of that
2010-11-06T01:50:00  <Frontier> An ai-related web site is offering premium memberships
2010-11-06T01:50:07  <antimatroid1> that is hardly a prize
2010-11-06T01:50:28  <Frontier> i know, but it is sold as a prize on the forums ^^
2010-11-06T01:50:33  <antimatroid1> the fact that the website doesn't even just have people sign up means i probably wouldn't want to use it
2010-11-06T01:51:06  <Codefun64> Frontier, I think I know what you mean

2010-11-06T02:42:47  <TheMacca> nice
2010-11-06T02:42:49  <TheMacca> where in oz?

2010-11-06T02:43:01  <antimatroid1> where were you in australia?
2010-11-06T02:43:08  <TheMacca> US schools pretty expensive in comparison
2010-11-06T02:43:17  <antimatroid1> yeah, i wouldn't be going unless on full funding
2010-11-06T02:43:21  <TheMacca> I remember looking to transfer my MBA from Monash to Northwestern
2010-11-06T02:43:33  <TheMacca> one semester at NW was whole course at Monash :)
2010-11-06T02:43:36  <TheMacca> rural Vic
2010-11-06T02:43:42  <TheMacca> then Melbourne for school

2010-11-06T02:45:01  <TheMacca> haven't followed much
2010-11-06T02:45:36  <antimatroid1> although can't say i'm very fond of the us either politically, but everyone says they have the best unis
2010-11-06T02:45:48  <TheMacca> hmmmm, they have good schools from what I've seen
2010-11-06T02:45:56  <TheMacca> but I wouldn't say they're much ahead of Australian schools
2010-11-06T02:46:01  <TheMacca> maybe the very best US ones
2010-11-06T02:46:03  <TheMacca> CMU, MIT, etc
2010-11-06T02:46:06  <TheMacca> (for CS)
2010-11-06T02:46:26  <TheMacca> and education prior to tertiary level here is *unbelievably* bad
2010-11-06T02:46:51  <antimatroid1> mit is my number one preference
2010-11-06T02:47:11  <antimatroid1> there's a nice looking lab in the cs department that does mostly game THEORY which would be awesome
2010-11-06T02:47:16  <antimatroid1> but obviously retardedly competitive
2010-11-06T02:47:24  <TheMacca> know some folks who went to MIT
2010-11-06T02:47:29  <TheMacca> (colleagues)
2010-11-06T02:47:34  <TheMacca> they speak very highly of it
2010-11-06T02:48:42  <antimatroid1> yeah everyone does, and it seems to be one of the few institutions i've come across to hold a similar attitude to education as i do
2010-11-06T02:48:52  <antimatroid1> my university sucks, they're strictly running to be a business
2010-11-06T02:49:24  <antimatroid1> any money is spent on trying to attract new money, ideally one would do that to improve resources for the actual work being done there, but not where i am
2010-11-06T02:50:19  <TheMacca> you'll like the US
2010-11-06T02:50:26  <TheMacca> there's some stuff you have to ignore / get used to

2010-11-06T06:35:46  <nullkuhl> i tried from cygwin using tcp.c and tried from windows using the java client
2010-11-06T06:35:54  <nullkuhl> in the java client i timeout and server closes connection
2010-11-06T06:36:06  <p4p4> TCP.jar works well for me
2010-11-06T06:36:28  <nullkuhl> in cygwin using ./tcp i get kill: No such process
2010-11-06T06:36:48  <p4p4> iand i spotted a fork, also

2010-11-06T06:38:01  <nullkuhl> p4p4: because the very same submission works on the official one.

2010-11-06T06:41:07  <nullkuhl> its the same main method
2010-11-06T06:42:06  <nullkuhl> could it be that i use external classes
2010-11-06T06:44:14  <nullkuhl> p4p4: now i was using the TCP.jar with the default bot, and i got a time out

2010-11-06T06:51:30  <nullkuhl> am suspecting a latency problem that is causing my timeout
2010-11-06T06:52:44  <p4p4> if you've got  a dynamic ip, maybe logging off, and on again ?

2010-11-06T07:17:57  <nullkuhl> lavalamp_: yes, the problem remains the same, people who are far from the server are more likely to get timeouts
2010-11-06T07:18:42  <lavalamp_> nullkuh1 yeah, maybe it should be increased further
2010-11-06T07:21:25  <nullkuhl> lavalamp_: any idea who is hosting it ? so that i can ask for timeout increasing ?

2010-11-06T07:54:17  <bhasker> so basically for planet X
2010-11-06T07:54:27  <antimatroid1> i say that i can send 200 ships from there in 2 turns time
2010-11-06T07:54:44  <bhasker> you scan # of ships each planet will have at turn Y where Y is the distance between X and each of the other planets?
2010-11-06T07:54:46  <antimatroid1> and will use those ships in a move
2010-11-06T07:55:16  <sigh> bhasker: sorry, that's not right... I confused myself
2010-11-06T07:55:25  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-06T07:55:43  <lavalamp_> My code would find 200 newly availible ships on the just captured neutral in two turns
2010-11-06T07:56:00  <bhasker> but how do you factor that into how many ships one can send at this turn
2010-11-06T07:56:16  *** hellman <hellman!~hellman@nat232-248-205-109.tvoe.tv> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-06T07:56:31  <antimatroid1> because my "moves" consist of a destination planet, then a vector of "fleets" which have (source, timesent, timeadded)
2010-11-06T07:56:48  <bhasker> no no i mean when the enemy is capturing that neutral
2010-11-06T07:56:58  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2010-11-06T07:57:07  <antimatroid1> i assume they can send what they'd have then
2010-11-06T07:57:08  <bhasker> basically lets say enemy sends a large fleet at a neutral close to one of your planets
2010-11-06T07:57:19  <lavalamp_> my defense/fortification code "holds" ships (subtracts them from that newly availible metric) when they are required for defense, so the other parts of my code don't even know those ships exist
2010-11-06T07:57:24  <bhasker> at turn X its still neutral
2010-11-06T07:57:38  <antimatroid1> what are you trying to calculate?
2010-11-06T07:57:38  <bhasker> now how many ships can you send from a planet close to the neutral at turn X
2010-11-06T07:57:50  <lavalamp_> oh the enemy is taking it? uhhhh
2010-11-06T07:57:53  <bhasker> yes

2010-11-06T07:58:14  <lavalamp_> ah yeah ok
2010-11-06T07:58:34  <lavalamp_> my fortify code scans ahead on neutrals to determine who takes them
2010-11-06T07:58:40  <antimatroid1> you want to take it before the enemy and be safe? you want (timeTheyArrive-timeYouArrive)*newGrowth + yourShips-neutralShips >= theirIncoming
2010-11-06T07:58:42  <antimatroid1> or something like that
2010-11-06T07:58:48  <bhasker> but what if you can't
2010-11-06T07:58:58  <bhasker> you just don't have enough ships closer
2010-11-06T07:59:12  <antimatroid1> then don't attack it
2010-11-06T07:59:43  <bhasker> yes but how do you figure out how many ships you can send out for other attacks at turn X , factoring in that 2 turns from now there will be a large fleet outside your door
2010-11-06T07:59:50  <lavalamp_> I treat neutrals that will be capture by the opponent as if they already belong to him but won't be able to send ships until the turn they're captured
2010-11-06T08:00:12  <lavalamp_> bbl
2010-11-06T08:01:15  <antimatroid1> bhasker: you can assume they send all their fleets at you into the future
2010-11-06T08:01:20  <antimatroid1> but you get crippled really fast then
2010-11-06T08:01:30  <antimatroid1> you could assume they send all fleets in the next 10 turns at you
2010-11-06T08:01:41  <bhasker> so basically what i was trying to do was something lke this
2010-11-06T08:01:55  <bhasker> if at turn X enemy was to launch all his ships at my planet and I was to do the same
2010-11-06T08:02:00  <bhasker> who will end up holding it
2010-11-06T08:02:09  <bhasker> if i do and it never switches to the enemy
2010-11-06T08:02:50  <antimatroid1> that's pretty much what i'm currently trying to do
2010-11-06T08:02:51  <bhasker> i send the minimum number of ships the planet has across all the turns
2010-11-06T08:02:56  <bhasker> the problem though is
2010-11-06T08:02:59  <bhasker> how do you account for
2010-11-06T08:03:03  <bhasker> a) ships in flight
2010-11-06T08:03:07  <antimatroid1> i simulate all out attacks on a planet, if i can hold, add that as a plausible move, update information and repeat
2010-11-06T08:03:08  <bhasker> he may have launched a huge fleet
2010-11-06T08:03:18  <antimatroid1> i assume they can send fleets like i can
2010-11-06T08:03:28  <bhasker> and how do you account for fleets heading towards neutrals
2010-11-06T08:03:34  <antimatroid1> so if he has 200 ships there in 2 moves turn, he can send 200 then, and g amount every turn after
2010-11-06T08:03:52  <antimatroid1> i have a future states vector telling me exactly what i expect the state of a planet to be in t turns
2010-11-06T08:03:59  <bhasker> i have that
2010-11-06T08:04:06  <antimatroid1> so just use the new ships there
2010-11-06T08:04:23  <bhasker> i think i am not being able to explain my problem
2010-11-06T08:04:31  <bhasker> let me find a game that has the problem i am trying to solve
2010-11-06T08:04:31  <antimatroid1> if(owner = oldowner )
2010-11-06T08:04:31  <antimatroid1> newships = currentships-oldships
2010-11-06T08:04:31  <antimatroid1> else
2010-11-06T08:04:31  <antimatroid1> newships = currentships
2010-11-06T08:05:19  <antimatroid1> that gives the number of ships sendable at each time point, i also have another scan before that to ensure i don't send out fleets for a planet that's going to be lost with that much sent out, but eventually i hope to remove that
2010-11-06T08:07:04  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-06T08:07:46  <bhasker> btw question

2010-11-06T08:09:16  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-06T08:09:44  <antimatroid1> ideally i think you want to send one fleet towards the middle there though
2010-11-06T08:09:48  <sigh> bhasker: you could have defended against those snipes
2010-11-06T08:09:52  <sigh> you had enough ships

2010-11-06T09:43:43  <sigh> bhasker: yeah, I kind of feel like that sometimes... that's why I took 2 week break earlier
2010-11-06T09:45:14  <sigh> bhasker: ships aren't everything, maybe your bot just had crappy planet positions
2010-11-06T09:45:22  <bhasker> lol no
2010-11-06T09:45:24  <bhasker> i just realized

2010-11-06T09:45:29  <bhasker> its my stupid neutral acquisition logic
2010-11-06T09:45:44  <bhasker> check turn 89 http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=880367
2010-11-06T09:45:49  <bhasker> i overestimated # of ships required
2010-11-06T09:46:50  <sigh> haha
2010-11-06T09:47:12  <sigh> more like underestimated the number of ships required for defence
2010-11-06T09:47:44  <bhasker> that too
2010-11-06T09:47:45  <bhasker> lol
2010-11-06T09:48:00  <bhasker> but if i hadn't gone for those two neutrals
2010-11-06T09:48:05  <bhasker> i could have easily taken back the planets
2010-11-06T09:48:24  <bhasker> the thing is my bot if it starts losing it tries to stretch a bit over minimal defense
2010-11-06T09:48:45  <sigh> fair enough
2010-11-06T09:49:33  <bhasker> thats why it went for both those neutrals
2010-11-06T09:49:40  <bhasker> one should have been enough though
2010-11-06T09:49:41  <bhasker> i think
2010-11-06T09:49:57  <sigh> makes sense
2010-11-06T09:50:13  <bhasker> maybe not
2010-11-06T09:50:22  <bhasker> there was an 8 growth difference
2010-11-06T09:50:29  <bhasker> if it had attacked and taken a planet back
2010-11-06T09:50:37  <bhasker> it would have been even
2010-11-06T09:50:41  <bhasker> actually it didnt need a neutral
2010-11-06T09:50:42  <bhasker> hmm

2010-11-06T10:04:04  <Migi32> who is he?
2010-11-06T10:04:05  <bhasker> so he factors in neutrals before he captures them
2010-11-06T10:04:09  <janstaunton> yeah I need to start doing that...

2010-11-06T10:04:52  <Migi32> it'd be pretty embarassing if he didn't do those calculations

2010-11-06T10:15:26  <Migi32> I mean, if you ask a question, he will answer
2010-11-06T10:15:52  <Migi32> but he won't openly explain the internals of his bot, like some of us are doing here
2010-11-06T10:16:01  <janstaunton> ah
2010-11-06T10:16:07  <janstaunton> Well that's fair considering he is winning
2010-11-06T10:16:15  <janstaunton> He using LISP too, meaning he prolly has some skilsl
2010-11-06T10:16:16  <janstaunton> :)
2010-11-06T10:16:19  <janstaunton> skills even
2010-11-06T10:16:28  <Migi32> no shit sherlock ;)
2010-11-06T10:17:40  <Migi32> is Lisp a compiled language?
2010-11-06T10:17:55  <janstaunton> depends
2010-11-06T10:17:58  <janstaunton> It can be compiled
2010-11-06T10:18:19  <janstaunton> It would be very impressive if it was fully interpreted
2010-11-06T10:18:25  <janstaunton> (his bot I mean)
2010-11-06T10:18:53  <siconize> question: do crashed-on-first-turn-matches count for elo?
2010-11-06T10:19:03  <antimatroid1> yes
2010-11-06T10:19:04  <Migi32> siconize, yes
2010-11-06T10:19:09  <siconize> :/
2010-11-06T10:19:10  <siconize> why
2010-11-06T10:19:15  <Migi32> why not?
2010-11-06T10:19:22  <Migi32> you crash, you lose
2010-11-06T10:19:22  <siconize> because the bot crashed? :D
2010-11-06T10:19:38  <siconize> yes but i am sure that its not my bots fault
2010-11-06T10:20:11  <Migi32> ah, like that. I thought these kind of problems had been fixed.
2010-11-06T10:20:28  <siconize> me too
2010-11-06T10:20:41  <siconize> but i had several of those crashes since my last upload
2010-11-06T10:21:01  <siconize> and crashing on turn 0 does not give me any advantage :p
2010-11-06T10:21:09  <Migi32> what language are you using?
2010-11-06T10:21:16  <siconize> c# ofcourse :D :D
2010-11-06T10:21:38  <siconize> i mean is their any other language with those troubles? ^^
2010-11-06T10:21:41  <siconize> ;)
2010-11-06T10:22:27  <siconize> there*
2010-11-06T10:22:39  <Migi32> :)
2010-11-06T10:22:51  <Migi32> well, the only thing you can do is wait until the problems get fixed, I think
2010-11-06T10:23:10  <Migi32> no use in contacting the contest organizers, they know
2010-11-06T10:23:29  <siconize> yes, i read the forum threads etc. :/
2010-11-06T10:24:11  <Migi32> but don't worry, any matches your bot is fighting now don't count for your final score yet, only after 27/11 they will
2010-11-06T10:24:24  <janstaunton> How long does the final tournament last for?
2010-11-06T10:24:32  <Migi32> no idea
2010-11-06T10:24:34  <siconize> 4 days(?)
2010-11-06T10:24:45  <Migi32> 4 days until the results are announced
2010-11-06T10:24:49  <siconize> Saturday Nov 27, 2010: submission deadline. No submissions will be accepted after 11:59 PM.  Wednesday Dec 1, 2010: official results and final rankings will be released
2010-11-06T10:25:13  <Migi32> but how many matches you will play etc, no idea
2010-11-06T10:26:00  <p4p4> bah, at the current rate this means ~50 matches for each, that's not much
2010-11-06T10:27:04  <Migi32> they should run a whole bunch of matches, with decreasing K-value over time
2010-11-06T10:27:25  <p4p4> K-value ?
2010-11-06T10:27:49  <Migi32> it's a parameter in the ELO algorithm, the higher K, the more your Elo rating gets adjusted after a match
2010-11-06T10:28:54  <Migi32> so you can run a million matches, if they all have a pretty high K, the end-result will still be somewhat based on luck
2010-11-06T10:29:18  <Migi32> but if you run a million matches with decreasing K-values over time, you should end up with pretty accurate rankings
2010-11-06T10:29:32  <p4p4> oK.

2010-11-06T10:30:10  <Migi32> hi
2010-11-06T10:30:13  <siconize> hi
2010-11-06T10:30:27  <Prillicy> I found the AI challenge entirely by accident, but I figured as part of my learning c# it's something good to do
2010-11-06T10:30:46  <siconize> no, they dont like c# ;D
2010-11-06T10:30:51  <siconize> ;)
2010-11-06T10:30:52  <siconize> joke
2010-11-06T10:30:56  * Prillicy rolls eyes. ;)
2010-11-06T10:31:07  <Migi32> well, you can run your bot on the TCP server, then you get many more games
2010-11-06T10:31:26  <siconize> sure, but it's not the same :P
2010-11-06T10:31:31  <Migi32> more info here: http://72.44.46.68/
2010-11-06T10:31:35  <Migi32> siconize, why not?
2010-11-06T10:31:35  <Prillicy> I uploaded the starter package like it suggests before I build.  The code seems pretty straight forward, so that's not the problem.
2010-11-06T10:33:02  <siconize> Migi32 its not the real contest.. and i dont want to lose against 1000 versions of  bocsimacko ;>
2010-11-06T10:33:10  <Prillicy> my question is much simpler, how do I run the test games on my computer
2010-11-06T10:33:28  <Migi32> siconize, don't worry he only runs one of them at a time :)
2010-11-06T10:33:42  <siconize> :D
2010-11-06T10:33:44  <siconize> okay^^
2010-11-06T10:34:00  <Migi32> Prillicy, you want to run test games against the (pretty easy) example bots?
2010-11-06T10:34:09  <Migi32> or against real bots from real people?
2010-11-06T10:34:19  <Prillicy> I'd like to start with the example bots
2010-11-06T10:34:25  <Prillicy> and work my way up to real people
2010-11-06T10:34:59  <Prillicy> honestly, I can perceive my code getting pretty complex here, so I want to test it on the easy ones, in part to make sure it will /work/ on the real game
2010-11-06T10:35:01  <Migi32> wait let me download the C# starter package and see
2010-11-06T10:36:03  <Migi32> well, I run this command to play against the example bot ProspectorBot:
2010-11-06T10:36:04  <janstaunton> can objective c be used for this?
2010-11-06T10:36:39  <siconize> Prillicy: download the testing application from here: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=743&start=0 , then compile your c# project to an .exe and use the testing app to play matches versus the example bots
2010-11-06T10:36:46  <Migi32> java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map43.txt 200 200 log.txt "COMMAND_TO_RUN_YOUR_BOT" "java -jar example_bots/ProspectorBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-11-06T10:36:49  <Prillicy> to my understanding, any language can, given someone can write in it
2010-11-06T10:38:12  <Migi32> or use the JBotManage, http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=751, it can also play on TCP
2010-11-06T10:38:21  <Migi32> JBotManager*
2010-11-06T10:38:33  <siconize> but it's strange ;)
2010-11-06T10:38:46  <Prillicy> thanks, that was exactly what I was looking for
2010-11-06T10:38:51  <Prillicy> wait
2010-11-06T10:38:54  <Prillicy> what's this other one?
2010-11-06T10:38:54  <Migi32> it's the only one that lets you watch your TCP games live
2010-11-06T10:39:13  <Migi32> Prillicy, mostly the same. You can choose
2010-11-06T10:39:16  <siconize> yes
2010-11-06T10:39:48  <Prillicy> but the second one I can not only run practice games, but also connect to the tcp games (so it's an all-in-one)?
2010-11-06T10:40:56  <Migi32> yea.
2010-11-06T10:41:23  <Prillicy> if it weren't for the inability of people here to make executables, I think I could grow to like this place
2010-11-06T10:42:08  <Migi32> the first one has an executable. Or is that not what you meant?
2010-11-06T10:43:07  <Prillicy> I saw that
2010-11-06T10:43:18  <Prillicy> but the first one can't do what the second one can...
2010-11-06T10:43:20  <Prillicy> hm
2010-11-06T10:43:28  <siconize> then download both^^
2010-11-06T10:43:33  <Prillicy> well, thanks, I'm going to fiddle for a bit, but I'll be watching this channel
2010-11-06T10:43:34  <Prillicy> I did
2010-11-06T10:43:46  <siconize> ok :)
2010-11-06T10:44:35  <Migi32> btw, is it even possible to make an executable from a java jar file?

2010-11-06T10:48:44  <Migi32> not many people here are a fan of Java. Neither am I. But if the Java game engine does more than the other one, I will use the Java one.
2010-11-06T10:49:33  <Prillicy> to be more specific, you were quite right, it's not hard to make an executable to do it either

2010-11-06T11:40:29  <Migi32> janstaunton, looks like he had the opportunity there to grab victory multiple times with his 200 planet
2010-11-06T11:41:05  <Migi32> not sure though
2010-11-06T11:41:25  <janstaunton> aye potentially...
2010-11-06T11:41:39  <janstaunton> I think I may have been supressing that tho with attacks on the rear planets

2010-11-06T11:47:46  <Migi32> I actually think attacking the rear planets made you vulnerable.
2010-11-06T11:48:16  <Prillicy> agree
2010-11-06T11:52:11  <janstaunton> aye I agree as well
2010-11-06T11:52:19  <janstaunton> Found a bug which is now fixed :)
2010-11-06T11:57:56  <Migi32> I wonder if a group of people start making an open-source bot how good it'd get
2010-11-06T12:00:56  <janstaunton> The agreed architecture of the bot alone would be very interesting
2010-11-06T12:01:10  <janstaunton> Although it would be design by committee I guess :)
2010-11-06T12:03:45  <Migi32> it'd probably depend on the people who start making the bot. Further people would only add things, I guess.
2010-11-06T12:04:02  <Migi32> but I'm sure that that bot would be fine-tuned like crazy.
2010-11-06T12:04:41  <p4p4> imagine 32 piano tuners at work on 1 piano
2010-11-06T12:04:47  <Migi32> lol
2010-11-06T12:04:49  <Migi32> good point
2010-11-06T12:04:49  <raedwulf>   :)
2010-11-06T12:04:50  <janstaunton> My thoughts exactly :)
2010-11-06T12:05:09  <janstaunton> Are you guys researchers or just nerds having a go?
2010-11-06T12:05:21  <raedwulf> < cs nerd
2010-11-06T12:05:23  <janstaunton> (I say just in the lightest possible sense :))
2010-11-06T12:05:59  <Prillicy> just bored
2010-11-06T12:06:43  <Migi32> I'm no researcher either.
2010-11-06T12:07:07  <Migi32> I mean, I research stuff for fun but not officially.
2010-11-06T12:07:57  <raedwulf> meh i need to finish off some notes :S
2010-11-06T12:08:00  <raedwulf> not fun
2010-11-06T12:08:23  <Migi32> yeah once it gets official there is less fun.
2010-11-06T12:08:47  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-11-06T12:10:24  <raedwulf> what version of mono is on the servers again? is it still the old v 2.0?

2010-11-06T12:21:02  <janstaunton> I am at york doing a PhD
2010-11-06T12:21:04  <raedwulf> York
2010-11-06T12:21:17  <janstaunton> In kind of machine learning things, but not game related
2010-11-06T12:21:17  <raedwulf> lol :P
2010-11-06T12:21:19  <raedwulf> brb
2010-11-06T12:21:28  <raedwulf> 3rd year - i am
2010-11-06T12:21:34  <janstaunton> ah
2010-11-06T12:21:39  <janstaunton> At york I assume?
2010-11-06T12:22:09  <janstaunton> Is your association on the main server set to york?
2010-11-06T12:22:12  <janstaunton> If so, which username are you?
2010-11-06T12:25:31  <Migi32> I'm from the university of Ghent, CS 3rd year undergrad.
2010-11-06T12:27:07  <nullkuhl> i'm from the german university in cairo, Computer Engineering, final undergrad year.
2010-11-06T12:28:40  <Migi32> nullkuhl, your 5th year then?
2010-11-06T12:29:54  <nullkuhl> yup
2010-11-06T12:30:23  <nullkuhl> engineering bachelor is usually a 4 years program though in europe/usa
2010-11-06T12:30:30  <raedwulf> janstaunton: i signed up as a team with a friend in Manchester, so its set to Other
2010-11-06T12:30:36  <janstaunton> ah
2010-11-06T12:30:39  <janstaunton> fair do's
2010-11-06T12:30:45  <janstaunton> dos
2010-11-06T12:30:47  <janstaunton> even
2010-11-06T12:30:56  <raedwulf> though i need to nudge him into helping me a bit hehe
2010-11-06T12:31:02  <janstaunton> heh
2010-11-06T12:31:17  <nullkuhl> what your current ranking guys in official server?
2010-11-06T12:31:27  <nullkuhl> what's*
2010-11-06T12:31:53  <raedwulf> mine is inconsequential, as its just a test bot with rage-bot style code
2010-11-06T12:32:09  <janstaunton> 118 for me

2010-11-06T12:33:37  <Migi32> my bot on the official server is ages old
2010-11-06T12:33:43  <Migi32> rank 500 or something :)
2010-11-06T12:34:24  <nullkuhl> ok, so am the worst lol.
2010-11-06T12:34:40  <raedwulf> :P
2010-11-06T12:34:50  <nullkuhl> http://www.ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=8244
2010-11-06T12:34:52  <raedwulf> i've got to put in an offensive strategy in my new bot
2010-11-06T12:37:12  <Migi32> nullkuhl, just skimming through some of your games I think your bot would benefit from the simple rule to never take a neutral if it's close to the enemy than to you
2010-11-06T12:37:20  <Migi32> closer*
2010-11-06T12:37:40  <Migi32> that'd be 300 ELO points right there :)
2010-11-06T12:38:25  <nullkuhl> Migi32: well, i think also attacking enemy planets in 1 big chunk is a bad idea, the attack to a planet can be divided into several fleets, and further the fleet could be sent from various planets.
2010-11-06T12:38:25  <raedwulf> janstaunton: did you do an undergrad degree at york?
2010-11-06T12:38:32  <janstaunton> yup
2010-11-06T12:38:39  <janstaunton> Been here for 7 years now :D
2010-11-06T12:38:48  <raedwulf> oh i recognise you
2010-11-06T12:38:54  <raedwulf> facebook :)
2010-11-06T12:39:03  <janstaunton> heh
2010-11-06T12:39:13  <janstaunton> I am growing those handlebars back atm
2010-11-06T12:39:21  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-11-06T12:39:21  <janstaunton> ah
2010-11-06T12:39:23  <janstaunton> I recognise you too
2010-11-06T12:39:28  <raedwulf> lol
2010-11-06T12:39:41  <janstaunton> Did you do MCP last year?
2010-11-06T12:39:44  <raedwulf> yep
2010-11-06T12:39:49  <raedwulf> well year before last*
2010-11-06T12:39:55  <janstaunton> yeah I demonstrated on that module
2010-11-06T12:39:55  <janstaunton> ah
2010-11-06T12:39:59  <janstaunton> yeah both years I did it
2010-11-06T12:40:05  <janstaunton> Seen you about too
2010-11-06T12:40:06  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-11-06T12:40:08  <raedwulf> yep
2010-11-06T12:40:14  <janstaunton> You doing a 4th year?
2010-11-06T12:40:34  <janstaunton> After this one?
2010-11-06T12:40:40  <raedwulf> had a placement last year, 3rd year now 4th year and then maybe phd
2010-11-06T12:40:41  <janstaunton> hang on...
2010-11-06T12:40:45  <janstaunton> ah I see
2010-11-06T12:40:51  <janstaunton> Where did you work on placement?
2010-11-06T12:41:06  <raedwulf> Thales - Transport and Security section
2010-11-06T12:41:12  <janstaunton> awwww yeah thales
2010-11-06T12:41:16  <janstaunton> I was IBM myself
2010-11-06T12:41:16  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-11-06T12:41:19  <raedwulf> ah ok
2010-11-06T12:41:48  <janstaunton> totally public conversation that is irrelevant to the channel :o
2010-11-06T12:42:04  <raedwulf> haha ^^, yea we've had weird ones in here before
2010-11-06T12:42:13  <nullkuhl> publicly logged as well :P
2010-11-06T12:42:14  <raedwulf> anyways, its all public and we can view the channel logs online :P
2010-11-06T12:42:20  <janstaunton> :)
2010-11-06T12:42:43  <janstaunton> I think my bot needs a serious redesign to cope with the likes of bocsimako and co
2010-11-06T12:43:04  <raedwulf> mine can probably cope with it, just need to actually write the rules in :P
2010-11-06T12:43:13  <raedwulf> which is easier said than done
2010-11-06T12:43:21  <janstaunton> heh
2010-11-06T12:43:34  <janstaunton> I have built a lot of helper procedures that need to be used
2010-11-06T12:43:40  <janstaunton> What language you doing it in?
2010-11-06T12:43:46  <raedwulf> not sure if it would work well against bocksimacko.... though
2010-11-06T12:43:57  <raedwulf> but hopefully top 50 at least, im writing it in C
2010-11-06T12:44:47  <raedwulf> C# and haskell did come to mind - but there was too much trouble with the C# initially and im only just learning haskell
2010-11-06T12:45:12  <janstaunton> Some of haskells features would be nice for future prediction
2010-11-06T12:45:17  <raedwulf> whereas i've been writing C code for ~4-5 years - something im familiar with
2010-11-06T12:45:19  <janstaunton> I just bit the bullet and went with Java
2010-11-06T12:45:29  <raedwulf> ah ok, im unfamiliar with java
2010-11-06T12:45:40  <raedwulf> unfortunately i was in the last Ada year :PO
2010-11-06T12:46:12  <raedwulf> and i've not had any real need to learn java - but ill have to eventually
2010-11-06T12:46:21  <janstaunton> Ada is for pros
2010-11-06T12:46:28  <janstaunton> haha it would be cool if the main server was ada friendly
2010-11-06T12:46:30  <raedwulf> shouldn't be too hard to pick up, since i know c#
2010-11-06T12:46:34  <janstaunton> Although that would be a ball ache
2010-11-06T12:46:41  <janstaunton> yeah java is so easy
2010-11-06T12:46:44  <raedwulf> hehe yea - i shouldn't think it would be too hard for them to support it
2010-11-06T12:46:47  <janstaunton> especially with eclipse and the like around
2010-11-06T12:46:53  <raedwulf> ah ok
2010-11-06T12:48:09  <raedwulf> i doubt there has been a demand for Ada tho hehe
2010-11-06T12:48:26  <nullkuhl> java is almost = C#
2010-11-06T12:48:51  <nullkuhl> it's almost the same library packages as well
2010-11-06T12:49:23  <janstaunton> I need to get to grips with C# eventually
2010-11-06T12:49:32  <raedwulf> i suppose some of c#'s newer features such as linq would be hard to replicate in java
2010-11-06T12:49:47  <janstaunton> C# have lambdas and things?
2010-11-06T12:49:51  <raedwulf> yep
2010-11-06T12:50:33  <raedwulf> they are fairly good, but it does feel a bit tack-on because c# is otherwise a imperative language
2010-11-06T12:51:09  <janstaunton> ah tack is fine as long as it works :D
2010-11-06T12:51:10  <janstaunton> Tuples?
2010-11-06T12:51:26  <raedwulf> ummmm i can't remember - i don't think so
2010-11-06T12:51:42  <raedwulf> if they had them, it was a newer c# 3.x + feature
2010-11-06T12:51:53  <janstaunton> What version does the main server do then?
2010-11-06T12:51:57  <raedwulf> ah its in c# 4.0
2010-11-06T12:52:16  <raedwulf> its using mono 2.0 now i think, which supports c# 3.0
2010-11-06T12:52:26  <raedwulf> but i might be wrong
2010-11-06T12:52:36  <raedwulf> people have reported success with c# 3.0 though
2010-11-06T12:52:48  <nullkuhl> c# 4.0 introducted various new attractive stuff
2010-11-06T12:53:02  <nullkuhl> for instance c# didnt have any library support for arbitrary precision arithmetic
2010-11-06T12:53:09  <nullkuhl> with c# 4.0 it now has
2010-11-06T12:53:32  <raedwulf> im quite impressed that mono 2.8 is really caught up with it all
2010-11-06T12:53:42  <janstaunton> mmmmmm tuples
2010-11-06T12:54:00  <janstaunton> How well does C# play with traditional C stuff?
2010-11-06T12:54:12  <janstaunton> I'm assuming not at all given the runtime
2010-11-06T12:54:25  <raedwulf> there's C interop - thats quite easy
2010-11-06T12:54:34  <raedwulf> give it a DLL and its happy
2010-11-06T12:55:09  <raedwulf> on the cross-platform front, its possible as well but there's some slightly different syntax
2010-11-06T12:55:46  <raedwulf> if you ever did visual basic 6, basically there's a source file with a series of declarations to import particular functions from C libraries
2010-11-06T12:57:01  <raedwulf> there's also other ways, you can use a C++ .NET library to do unmanaged-managed-mixed language wrapper for the C library
2010-11-06T12:57:53  <raedwulf> but thats significantly more difficult and only makes sense if you're wrapping c++ dll/library
2010-11-06T12:58:10  <janstaunton> Looks very attractive
2010-11-06T12:58:19  <janstaunton> Especially since java is being shat on by Oracle atm :)
2010-11-06T12:58:24  <raedwulf> haha
2010-11-06T12:58:34  <janstaunton> And anything that loves Tuples is hella cool
2010-11-06T12:58:45  <janstaunton> So many times have I wanted tuples
2010-11-06T12:59:19  <raedwulf> :D
2010-11-06T12:59:31  <janstaunton> Will do my next project in it
2010-11-06T12:59:37  <raedwulf> neat
2010-11-06T12:59:45  <janstaunton> Although am tempted to restart this challenge in it atm
2010-11-06T13:00:05  <raedwulf> people battle with what the server can compile though atm hehe
2010-11-06T13:02:56  <janstaunton> ah

2010-11-06T13:03:05  <janstaunton> How does C# fair in terms of speed vs java/
2010-11-06T13:03:08  <janstaunton> ?
2010-11-06T13:03:40  <raedwulf> this is opinionated, but java is probably slightly faster with more memory usage

2010-11-06T13:04:12  <janstaunton> I see
2010-11-06T13:04:30  <nullkuhl> older C# versions were pretty faster though
2010-11-06T13:04:50  <raedwulf> java has a more aggressive optimiser, but basically caches so much in memory - in terms of start time, i suspect c# wins against java by a lot too

2010-11-06T13:13:17  <raedwulf> msvs 2010 is definitely the best, but of the free ones monodevelop if you're on linux and on windows (free) sharp develop
2010-11-06T13:13:31  <janstaunton> Dare I say, what about OS X?!
2010-11-06T13:13:31  <demerzel_> vs2010 is shite
2010-11-06T13:13:36  <demerzel_> i wish i'd stayed with 2008

2010-11-06T13:15:36  <demerzel_> i remember you had a bug where you sent just enough to get me to 0 for like a week hehe
2010-11-06T13:15:45  <janstaunton> yeah, I choose planets properly now, it's just attacking them that's the problem

2010-11-06T13:20:53  <Migi32> janstaunton, impressive
2010-11-06T13:21:06  <demerzel_> i am starting to think that payoff matrices aren't optimal for neutral acq

2010-11-06T13:21:31  <janstaunton> yup
2010-11-06T13:21:40  <janstaunton> Still a long way to go tho :D
2010-11-06T13:21:41  <demerzel_> maybe if i had stuck to one .language i'd be able to say the same thing lol
2010-11-06T13:21:58  <janstaunton> I am tempted to switch to C# since my bot is still quite basic feature wise
2010-11-06T13:22:03  <demerzel_> oh god don't
2010-11-06T13:22:09  <janstaunton> But after hearing the horror stories I prolly stick with java
2010-11-06T13:22:12  <demerzel_> that's why i went to C
2010-11-06T13:22:14  <demerzel_> what is it in now
2010-11-06T13:22:15  <Migi32> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=bocsimacko-b0.51 very impressive actually
2010-11-06T13:22:50  <janstaunton> Java for me baby
2010-11-06T13:23:08  <janstaunton> I need to start testing branches like he does too
2010-11-06T13:23:18  <demerzel_> oh hell you wouldn't gain anything by going C#
2010-11-06T13:23:19  <janstaunton> I don't leave one on long enough to get an accurate measure of how good it is
2010-11-06T13:23:20  <demerzel_> they're nearly identical
2010-11-06T13:23:43  <janstaunton> well... mostly for learning purposes, but yeah I just wanna get a good score on this and I know Java best :)

2010-11-06T14:22:43  <siconize> distance between the start planets is < 1
2010-11-06T14:24:11  <demerzel_> well i hope somebody uses my code
2010-11-06T14:24:22  <demerzel_> i think its pretty approachable with everything xml doc'd
2010-11-06T14:24:34  <demerzel_> def better than the starter pack at least haha
2010-11-06T14:26:26  <McLeopold> amstan: how is your height map code going?
2010-11-06T14:27:27  <Migi32> siconize, imagine that the neutral between those planets had 3 ships, there'd be a bunch of invisible battle :)
2010-11-06T14:27:31  <Migi32> battles*
2010-11-06T14:29:14  <demerzel_> haha oh shit i forgot about 0
2010-11-06T14:29:22  <demerzel_> what are the stats
2010-11-06T14:31:21  <Migi32> demerzel_, how good us that bot?
2010-11-06T14:32:02  <demerzel_> the one i shared?  it's hovering aroudn 400 it peaked at 150
2010-11-06T14:32:11  <demerzel_> has an obvious bug where it doesn't launch until all incoming is done
2010-11-06T14:32:36  <Migi32> you know that a lot of people were against the open-sourcing of some other C# bot
2010-11-06T14:32:37  <demerzel_> it's a recode of my original C# bot which peaked at 100ish - not complete
2010-11-06T14:32:50  <demerzel_> yea i know and i dont care i don't understand that
2010-11-06T14:33:27  <demerzel_> the targetting logic for the one i shared is extremely simple: if (cost/value) > 0 && cost/value > (cost/value other target)
2010-11-06T14:33:47  <demerzel_> err >1
2010-11-06T14:34:15  <Migi32> I think you should maybe remove all actual bot logic and have it do nothing, only have stuff like future planet state prediction and the TCP stuff and all that
2010-11-06T14:34:24  <demerzel_> why
2010-11-06T14:34:38  <demerzel_> anybody in here could easily destroy it

2010-11-06T14:34:46  <demerzel_> and probably has lol
2010-11-06T14:35:35  <Migi32> the logic against the other one was that people should come up with their own bot logic, not use that of others.
2010-11-06T14:36:08  <demerzel_> i'm pretty sure anybody who's taken economic 101 can come up with a cost effectiveness ratio
2010-11-06T14:36:18  <demerzel_> that's all it is
2010-11-06T14:36:26  <siconize> but people can upload your bot...
2010-11-06T14:37:04  <demerzel_> the logic argument doesn't make sense to me
2010-11-06T14:37:14  <demerzel_> what would make sense is 'people who can't code state correctly shouldn't benefit'
2010-11-06T14:37:24  <demerzel_> but i spent enough time on state i am sympathetic to new coders
2010-11-06T14:37:41  <siconize> 'people who can't code or do not want to spend much time will upload your bot'
2010-11-06T14:37:48  <Migi32> yea but that's another thing: it funnels everyone into using the same kind of logic
2010-11-06T14:37:50  <demerzel_> 'and lose'
2010-11-06T14:38:04  <siconize> rank 400 != lose ;)
2010-11-06T14:38:33  <siconize> 400 = part of the best 10%
2010-11-06T14:38:37  <demerzel_> i really don't see the argument honestly - that bot is super easy to beat with any kind of strategy - if people just upload that unchanged it will lose
2010-11-06T14:39:18  <siconize> you said it is on rank 400?!
2010-11-06T14:39:23  <demerzel_> yea it is
2010-11-06T14:39:29  <demerzel_> somewhere around there anyway
2010-11-06T14:39:51  <demerzel_> it's this one: http://www.ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=9166 -- although i think i tweaked that one a bit
2010-11-06T14:39:53  <Migi32> demerzel_, at least some % of the people that will use that bot will just keep making small changes to improve on it, which as I said "funnels" the amount of creativity of people in one direction
2010-11-06T14:40:02  <demerzel_> same base code anyawy
2010-11-06T14:42:34  <Migi32> and those kinds of people aren't necessarily stupid. If they had started with neural networks and kept improving upon that they could gain some insight and win the contest
2010-11-06T14:42:37  <siconize> when someone posted kanpsack01 as solution for turnj-1-expansion everyone takes it so soon we will see you bot in 1000 variations
2010-11-06T14:42:48  <demerzel_> Migi32: as opposed to what?  making small changes to the starter pack?  the bar is so high now you'd have to practically recode it from scratch to have a real chance
2010-11-06T14:44:11  <Migi32> demerzel_, no that's why I say you should definitely share the TCP code and future planet state prediction code etc, every bot - neural network or ratio or minimax - all use that
2010-11-06T14:44:28  <demerzel_> haha if they have neural networks i'm pretty sure my old code isn't going to do jack for them
2010-11-06T14:46:12  <Migi32> and if they really want to win they will have to recode all of the actual bot logic anyway
2010-11-06T14:46:50  <demerzel_> i see what you're saying and i would agree with you if it did anything other than basic arithmetic calculations
2010-11-06T14:47:10  <Migi32> you say anyone can come up with a cost effectiveness ratio - well let them
2010-11-06T14:47:12  <demerzel_> but it doesn't so as far as i'm concerned it's not a threat to the 'state of the contest' or whatever

2010-11-06T14:50:46  <Migi32> I know you have good intentions with this, demerzel_, but quoting RebelXT "releasing ready-to-go source code has potential to cause more harm than good."
2010-11-06T14:52:32  <Migi32> releasing utility code: great. releasing bot logic: not pure evil but more bad than good
2010-11-06T14:53:13  <demerzel_> i'm sorry but i really don't understand the vehement disapproval - there is one line that says if cost effectivness good then go
2010-11-06T14:53:20  <demerzel_> i don't see how removing that line would change anything
2010-11-06T14:54:39  <demerzel_> that's why i released it honestly - the logic is one line lol

2010-11-06T15:04:09  <demerzel_> i did take my test stuff out since it had some advanced logic haha
2010-11-06T15:04:13  <Migi32> no offense, the rest of the code looks good
2010-11-06T15:04:47  <demerzel_> it's more efficient than a loop
2010-11-06T15:05:14  <Migi32> yea by like 0.01%
2010-11-06T15:05:15  <demerzel_> db stuff is a hack anyway i never finished it
2010-11-06T15:05:29  <demerzel_> it works iirc but was just a slop together bit

2010-11-06T15:12:09  <demerzel_> actually that bot is below my current official entry because it's before i put in the future launches etc
2010-11-06T15:12:19  <demerzel_> so even less of a threat lol
2010-11-06T15:14:02  <demerzel_> now if i could only get my c bot to be as stable
2010-11-06T15:14:24  <lavalamp_> someone released a top 50 bot and took a lot of flack for it
2010-11-06T15:14:28  <lavalamp_> he took it down
2010-11-06T15:15:00  <siconize> ...he took it down before i could have a look on i t :(
2010-11-06T15:15:00  <siconize> ;)
2010-11-06T15:15:05  <lavalamp_> Personally I think getting the state tracking right is a large part of the competition
2010-11-06T15:15:18  <demerzel_> it's not nearly top 50 material

2010-11-06T15:15:35  <demerzel_> lavalamp_: i agree on the state calc
2010-11-06T15:15:43  <lavalamp_> I don't really care (my current sucky bot is 200's) but I understand why people wouldn't want that out until after the comp is over
2010-11-06T15:16:24  <demerzel_> i am pretty sure state still has some bugs too - the framework is what it offers more than a turnkey bot
2010-11-06T15:16:34  <lavalamp_> haha
2010-11-06T15:17:47  <demerzel_> i mean they're the insidious 'if situation x, y, and z all occur simultaneously' kind of bugs nothing overt
2010-11-06T15:18:02  <demerzel_> i stopped using it before i could thoroughly test it
2010-11-06T15:21:27  <lavalamp_> my state tracking had a lot of problems I didn't realize-- it's a good thing I paused my minimax bot to make a simpler one with the same framework
2010-11-06T15:21:51  <lavalamp_> I think even the simple bot might be awesome when I'm done
2010-11-06T15:21:53  <demerzel_> lavalamp_: yea i am spending ungodly amounts of time testing state
2010-11-06T15:22:09  <lavalamp_> it's kinda depressing how many problems it had >.<
2010-11-06T15:22:32  <lavalamp_> not just bugs but glaring oversights
2010-11-06T15:22:47  <demerzel_> i know the feeling
2010-11-06T15:23:20  <lavalamp_> though I think mine is more ambitious than most-- I keep track of "newly availible ships" at each point so my orders will never conflict

2010-11-06T15:36:46  <Prillicy> how are you supposed to compile the bot so that it can be used in the test games?
2010-11-06T15:36:55  <lavalamp_> demerzel_: apparantly we think very much alike...
2010-11-06T15:37:07  <lavalamp_> Prillicy: language?
2010-11-06T15:37:13  <Prillicy> c#
2010-11-06T15:37:22  <Prillicy> I'm still learing
2010-11-06T15:37:32  <lavalamp_> sorry don't know it, maybe demerzel_ can tell you...
2010-11-06T15:38:56  <siconize> Prillicy just compile it to .exe?
2010-11-06T15:39:25  <Prillicy> right, can't compile mybot.cs to exe 'cause it doesn't have references to the right functions
2010-11-06T15:39:53  <siconize> you added all 4 *.cs from the starter package to a c# project?
2010-11-06T15:40:13  <Prillicy> siconize: I don't use, nor have Visual Studio, so please don't talk like that
2010-11-06T15:40:22  <siconize> :D
2010-11-06T15:40:24  <siconize> ah sorry
2010-11-06T15:40:27  <siconize> :P
2010-11-06T15:40:50  <Prillicy> but I think I know what you mean
2010-11-06T15:40:58  <siconize> ok ;)
2010-11-06T15:41:04  <Prillicy> I compiled planet and fleet to dlls
2010-11-06T15:41:17  <Prillicy> and compiled planetwars.cs to a dll referencing planet and fleet
2010-11-06T15:41:27  <Prillicy> and then compiled mybot.cs referencing all 3 dlls
2010-11-06T15:41:32  <Prillicy> and it made an exe
2010-11-06T15:41:39  <demerzel_> i really have no idea - i wouldn't use C# unless i had vs lol
2010-11-06T15:41:41  <Prillicy> but it doesn't work
2010-11-06T15:41:54  <Prillicy> I don't have any option
2010-11-06T15:41:58  <siconize> sounds very specific^^
2010-11-06T15:42:03  <demerzel_> what are you compiling it with
2010-11-06T15:42:18  <Prillicy> csc.exe
2010-11-06T15:42:23  <Prillicy> .net framework
2010-11-06T15:42:51  <demerzel_> what is the error you get when you just try to csc *.cs
2010-11-06T15:43:12  <Prillicy> the class planetwars does not exist
2010-11-06T15:43:21  <demerzel_> hmm but it does
2010-11-06T15:43:27  <Prillicy> not in mybot.cs
2010-11-06T15:43:38  <demerzel_> are you trying to csc mybot.cs
2010-11-06T15:43:42  <demerzel_> you have to *.cs
2010-11-06T15:43:44  <Prillicy> oh, I see
2010-11-06T15:43:50  <Prillicy> never thought of that.. thanks
2010-11-06T15:44:50  <janzert> just as a clarification about the boost library mentioned earlier
2010-11-06T15:45:08  <janzert> I know the boost package is installed on the server but I don't see that the compiler is linking it in
2010-11-06T15:45:21  <janzert> so if someone wants to test it and report back that would be great
2010-11-06T15:45:46  <Prillicy> told you I was compiling it wrong
2010-11-06T15:47:13  <demerzel_> janzert: -I
2010-11-06T15:47:39  <demerzel_> janzert: so for example if you put them in boost it's gcc <whatever> -Iboost
2010-11-06T15:47:59  <demerzel_> relative path no space

2010-11-06T15:48:18  <demerzel_> so if it's in c:\compiler and the stuff is in c:\boost then it's -I../boost
2010-11-06T15:49:14  <lavalamp_> demerzel_, I think he's talking about linking not including header files
2010-11-06T15:49:23  <demerzel_> either that or have them in the compiler dir
2010-11-06T15:49:52  <demerzel_> why wouldn't it link if it's in the dir or include path?
2010-11-06T15:50:04  <demerzel_> maybe they're named diff
2010-11-06T15:51:29  <lavalamp_> compiled libs are usually in a different place than the header files I think
2010-11-06T15:51:53  <lavalamp_> plus linker has its own option (I don't know gcc well enough to say what it is)
2010-11-06T15:53:05  <demerzel_> well libs are the same really - just -L instead of -I
2010-11-06T15:53:14  <demerzel_> iirc
2010-11-06T15:53:20  <lavalamp_> ok that sounds plausible
2010-11-06T15:55:06  <demerzel_> i need to stop spamming up irc and work on my state code lol
2010-11-06T15:55:13  <demerzel_> too much coffee getting distracted
2010-11-06T15:56:17  <Prillicy> anyone here every tried using the c# starter package? i keep getting "cannot open fleet.cs file is corrupt"

2010-11-06T16:37:55  <siconize_> no vs, low resolution, no java.. o0 :p
2010-11-06T16:39:24  <Prillicy> no vs?
2010-11-06T16:39:26  <Prillicy> oh,

2010-11-06T16:39:46  <siconize_> yeah
2010-11-06T16:39:47  <Prillicy> yes, I'm working on my netbook at the moment, but I'm learning C# without Vs 'cause I don't have VS at work and I'm not allowed to download it
2010-11-06T16:40:04  <Prillicy> and I don't have java on my netbook I don't think
2010-11-06T16:40:15  <siconize_> and you cannot install it?
2010-11-06T16:40:20  <Prillicy> the exe one works, but I can't see parts of the map
2010-11-06T16:40:23  <Prillicy> I can
2010-11-06T16:40:32  <Prillicy> I have it at work, not that it matters there
2010-11-06T16:40:50  <Prillicy> could I watch the game in console?
2010-11-06T16:40:56  <Prillicy> it'd be easier I think

2010-11-06T16:42:57  <Prillicy> I have portable java
2010-11-06T16:43:10  <Prillicy> could I call the java command from the portable java directory?

2010-11-06T16:43:52  <Prillicy> I think the easy way was out the second my work refused to give me VS

2010-11-06T19:36:04  <Prillicy> how can I run the visualizer without using relative directories?
2010-11-06T19:36:24  <Prillicy> can I use c:\blah instead of tools/example_bots ?
2010-11-06T19:36:33  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-06T19:36:38  <Prillicy> k, thanks
2010-11-06T19:36:49  <McLeopold> you can always put a full path in the java command line
2010-11-06T19:37:03  <Prillicy> now, some of it's in ""
2010-11-06T19:37:09  <Prillicy> can I still put my directories in ""?
2010-11-06T19:37:14  <Prillicy> or will that cause a problem?
2010-11-06T19:37:21  <McLeopold> what is ""?
2010-11-06T19:37:28  <McLeopold> the root?
2010-11-06T19:37:58  <McLeopold> use quotes if you path has a space
2010-11-06T19:38:17  <Prillicy> right, but part of the args has "" in it
2010-11-06T19:38:18  <Migi32> Prillicy, yes you can
2010-11-06T19:38:33  <Migi32> the "" isn't necessary I think
2010-11-06T19:38:33  <Prillicy> java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" "java -jar example_bots/DualBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-11-06T19:38:39  <Prillicy> it isn't?
2010-11-06T19:38:48  <Migi32> oh, yes, it is necessary here
2010-11-06T19:38:58  <Migi32> s/yes/no
2010-11-06T19:39:27  <Prillicy> so how can I get my directories with spaces in there?
2010-11-06T19:39:55  <Migi32> replace "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" with the command to run your bot
2010-11-06T19:40:05  <Migi32> also with "" if that command has spaces in it
2010-11-06T19:40:19  <Prillicy> right, except running the other bots

2010-11-06T19:44:57  <McLeopold> no yet
2010-11-06T19:44:58  <Prillicy> I'm just trying to run the visualizer against these other bots
2010-11-06T19:45:11  <Prillicy> and I don't want to command line it
2010-11-06T19:45:20  <Prillicy> so I've built a c# program to do it
2010-11-06T19:46:28  <McLeopold> are you in windows?
2010-11-06T19:46:45  <Prillicy> no, I build for .NET on my apple
2010-11-06T19:46:50  <Prillicy> ;)
2010-11-06T19:46:51  <Prillicy> j/k
2010-11-06T19:47:38  <Migi32> oh Prillicy sorry you should've written my name, then it gives a beep here and you instantly get my attention again. For windows, try this: "chdir C:/your_dir/; command_to_run_your_bot"
2010-11-06T19:47:54  * Prillicy facepalms
2010-11-06T19:48:24  <Prillicy> I built this as a c# process to run the visualizer with arguments
2010-11-06T19:48:43  <Prillicy> the arguments must then have an actual, not relative directory
2010-11-06T19:48:43  <McLeopold> Migi32: do you have anymore cool bots like your vortex one?
2010-11-06T19:49:14  <Migi32> McLeopold, nope. I'm working on a new one with an ending dance though :)
2010-11-06T19:49:19  <Migi32> a victory dance :)
2010-11-06T19:49:27  <McLeopold> Prillicy: either will work, but for relative, you need to know what it is relative to.
2010-11-06T19:49:34  <Migi32> are you still making new funky bots?
2010-11-06T19:49:42  <Prillicy> thus, I need to do so with an actual directory
2010-11-06T19:49:50  <Prillicy> but an actual has spaces and needs to be in ""
2010-11-06T19:49:57  <Prillicy> but since the bots are java files, I already need ""
2010-11-06T19:49:59  <McLeopold> Migi32: not yet.  I'm working on my framework.
2010-11-06T19:50:00  <Prillicy> java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" "java -jar example_bots/DualBot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-11-06T19:50:02  <Prillicy> as you can se
2010-11-06T19:50:27  <McLeopold> so, you need nested quotes.
2010-11-06T19:50:40  <McLeopold> I think escaping or doubling might work.

2010-11-06T19:51:37  <Migi32> don't know if it was on windows or on linux

2010-11-06T19:52:24  <Prillicy> I was going to see if the command prompt would let me escape the ""
2010-11-06T19:53:18  <Prillicy> hah, works!

2010-11-06T19:53:40  <Prillicy> wierd, but it works

2010-11-06T21:53:34  <antimatroid1> but it does better than most other "contests"
2010-11-06T21:54:03  <antimatroid1> like in a sporting contest, it's basically luck of who you get drawn to play and how well you play on the day, this beats the hell out of that for accurate rankings
2010-11-06T21:54:06  <lavalamp_> bocsimacko seems to get lucky a lot then...
2010-11-06T21:54:18  <antimatroid1> he easily has the best bot
2010-11-06T21:54:57  <Prillicy> I imagine he doesn't share his  ideas?
2010-11-06T21:55:11  <antimatroid1> he has been somewhat happy to share when asked
2010-11-06T21:55:17  <antimatroid1> more so than i would have expected tbh
2010-11-06T21:56:13  <Prillicy> hmm
2010-11-06T21:56:31  <Prillicy> so I'm still having a problem with my visualizer build
2010-11-06T21:56:54  <antimatroid1> bah, i mustn't start programming again till tuesday
2010-11-06T21:57:03  <lavalamp_> we know he does some sort of 1 ply something and has an evaluation function that he spends a lot of time tuning
2010-11-06T21:57:17  <antimatroid1> the evaluation function is everything
2010-11-06T21:57:21  <antimatroid1> for this
2010-11-06T21:57:39  <antimatroid1> 1 ply minimax tree** btw
2010-11-06T21:57:52  <antimatroid1> i'm not entirely sure what he menas by 1 ply though
2010-11-06T21:58:21  <antimatroid1> perhaps he means he makes a complete set of moves for him at each node then the same for the opponent player, that giving one ply
2010-11-06T21:58:31  <antimatroid1> but i think there's a number of things that could fall under "1 ply"

2010-11-06T22:57:45  <lavalamp_> that doesn't sound like a number?
2010-11-06T22:58:18  <demerzel_> haha

2010-11-06T22:58:36  <demerzel_> so sun sdk latest jre
2010-11-06T22:58:38  <lavalamp_> huh
2010-11-06T22:58:47  <demerzel_> err -sdk
2010-11-06T23:00:01  <lavalamp_> Prillicy: so it doesn't start at all? or it gives that error when you try to run a bot?
2010-11-06T23:00:20  <Prillicy> no, gives that error when I try to start it from command line
2010-11-06T23:00:23  <Prillicy> and doesn't start
2010-11-06T23:01:01  <lavalamp_> huh
2010-11-06T23:01:20  <lavalamp_> you're running java -jar jbotmanage.jar or whatever?
2010-11-06T23:01:28  <lavalamp_> *manager
2010-11-06T23:01:31  <demerzel_> paste your command line arg

2010-11-06T23:02:49  <demerzel_> no what you are actually trying to run
2010-11-06T23:03:07  <demerzel_> ohoh i see it above
2010-11-06T23:03:14  * Prillicy grins.
2010-11-06T23:03:18  <demerzel_> java -jar is what you're missing
2010-11-06T23:03:21  <demerzel_> before jbotmanager
2010-11-06T23:03:36  * Prillicy facepalms.
2010-11-06T23:03:51  <lavalamp_> damn beat me to it
2010-11-06T23:06:54  <Prillicy> ok, got it running, but when I click start and then click > nothing happens
2010-11-06T23:07:04  <Prillicy> yes, I set up the bots
2010-11-06T23:07:11  <Prillicy> used this once before
2010-11-06T23:08:11  <demerzel_> my guess would be your bot isn't working

2010-11-06T23:13:45  <Prillicy> it's the starter bot
2010-11-06T23:13:55  <Prillicy> I have yet to get a visualizer working, so I'm not building other bots
2010-11-06T23:13:59  <Prillicy> it worked against a human
2010-11-06T23:14:00  <Prillicy> just tested it

2010-11-06T23:14:57  <demerzel_> no offense but lots of people use that and "-jar" almost had you quitting lol
2010-11-06T23:15:09  <demerzel_> i'm pretty sure it's something on your end

2010-11-06T23:15:44  <Prillicy> i had this same problem earlier with this one, which is why I went through all of the effort I did to get another visualizer working to no avail
2010-11-06T23:16:03  <Prillicy> and no, I almost quit cause I've been working at visualizers all day and haven't even gotten to  start with the AI
2010-11-06T23:16:18  <Prillicy> 'cause I can't get one damn visualizer to work
2010-11-06T23:16:32  <demerzel_> i have never used that particular one so i don't know what it needs
2010-11-06T23:17:05  <demerzel_> are you running the same exe twice
2010-11-06T23:17:12  <demerzel_> depending on your os it might not like that make a copy
2010-11-06T23:17:14  <Prillicy> no
2010-11-06T23:17:22  <Prillicy> but that worked when I did that
2010-11-06T23:18:36  <demerzel_> good - gonna go work on some logic now that state seems to be stable, hope i don't break it again lol

2010-11-06T23:37:45  <Prillicy> k
2010-11-06T23:37:45  <McLeopold> for this contest, it will only be 1-2

2010-11-06T23:56:15  <Prillicy> k, thanks

2010-11-06T23:57:20  <McLeopold> You'll want to have a good handle on the order of battle.
2010-11-06T23:57:46  <pgpaskar_> man that top10 is all over the place
2010-11-06T23:57:54  <pgpaskar_> people are getting seriously good
2010-11-06T23:58:10  <McLeopold> You'll need a function that can calculate the battle and prediction the future.

2010-11-06T23:58:19  <Prillicy> not yet
2010-11-06T23:58:31  <Prillicy> first I want to get it to make smart moves
2010-11-06T23:58:49  <McLeopold> umm, prediction future state will get you smart moves.
2010-11-06T23:59:04  <McLeopold> The best example is the "poach" or "snipe"
2010-11-06T23:59:40  <McLeopold> if an enemy fleet takes a neutral with just 1 extra ships, then it's pretty easy to send a fleet 1 turn after with the growth rate + 1
2010-11-06T23:59:53  <McLeopold> You need to be able to predict the future state of a planet to see that
