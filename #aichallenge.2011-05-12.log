2011-05-12T02:25:53  <Frontier> amstan, janzert, antimatroid, do you know anything about this? sigh and McLeopold seem to be offline
2011-05-12T02:26:09  <antimatroid> no idea sorry
2011-05-12T02:26:37  <Frontier> Does playgame.py run on your computer?
2011-05-12T02:28:48  <Frontier> This seems to be a sandbox thing. I'll look into the command line options of playgame.py. Maybe there is a switch to run it without chroot.

2011-05-12T03:10:15  <Frontier> antimatroid: Do you like the darker background where ants stick out more?: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer.php?game_id=2&debug=true
2011-05-12T03:11:05  <antimatroid> possibly
2011-05-12T03:11:14  <antimatroid> could i suggest making that light blue the water colour?
2011-05-12T03:11:29  <antimatroid> and i agree with mcleopold about having the other view (with the wrapped edges) as default :P
2011-05-12T03:12:13  <Frontier> yeah I'll remove the border in the next version without asking ^^
2011-05-12T03:12:27  <antimatroid> :)
2011-05-12T03:12:31  <Frontier> but I'll add a "center map" button instead
2011-05-12T03:12:35  <antimatroid> it's quite dark?
2011-05-12T03:12:45  <antimatroid> i like colourful :P
2011-05-12T03:12:59  <Frontier> me too, so I am unsure and ask you
2011-05-12T03:13:17  <antimatroid> what was the last ground colour?
2011-05-12T03:13:23  <antimatroid> a very light brown would work?
2011-05-12T03:13:34  <antimatroid> like, the food colour say :P
2011-05-12T03:13:37  <Frontier> now it is brighter
2011-05-12T03:13:56  <Frontier> oh... you know we may have a lot of ant colors in other games
2011-05-12T03:14:03  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-05-12T03:14:13  <antimatroid> but if water became light blue, couldn't dark blue be a possible ant colour?
2011-05-12T03:14:18  <Frontier> I don't want to go close to the medium brightness with the terrain color for that reason
2011-05-12T03:14:19  <antimatroid> basically just swapping those two?
2011-05-12T03:14:24  <antimatroid> ahhh fair enough
2011-05-12T03:15:00  <Frontier> hmm the terrain looks like crap now on my screen
2011-05-12T03:15:18  <Frontier> damn cheap notebook screen
2011-05-12T03:15:54  <antimatroid> it doesn't look as good on mine :P
2011-05-12T03:16:09  <antimatroid> there must be a nice combination that looks right
2011-05-12T03:16:42  <antimatroid> how hard would it be to amuse me and switch the water colour temporarily anyway? :P
2011-05-12T03:17:39  <Frontier> well i have the player color as r, g, b and not as hex, but wait... it will work...
2011-05-12T03:18:05  <Frontier> oh shit, that was the red color
2011-05-12T03:18:12  <antimatroid> :p
2011-05-12T03:18:25  <antimatroid> lava level :P
2011-05-12T03:18:43  <Frontier> why not :) set the colors in the map
2011-05-12T03:18:47  <antimatroid> it's orange too :P
2011-05-12T03:19:16  <antimatroid> have you tried using a very unnoisy background like on the old ants visualiser?
2011-05-12T03:19:42  <antimatroid> would probably not look right with the other pixels though
2011-05-12T03:20:09  <antimatroid> i think that blue is much nicer for water personally :P
2011-05-12T03:20:36  <Frontier> it looks like a swimming pool blue to me
2011-05-12T03:20:46  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-05-12T03:20:52  <antimatroid> or a not too deep river
2011-05-12T03:21:25  <Frontier> I should make it dark blue and add waves in bright blue :)
2011-05-12T03:23:04  <antimatroid> :p
2011-05-12T03:23:38  <Ice_Harley> Frontier: amazing visualizer. Great work
2011-05-12T03:23:56  <antimatroid> he is the visualiser king
2011-05-12T03:24:05  <antimatroid> you should have seen the one he made for a past antwars game :P
2011-05-12T03:24:17  <Frontier> thank you Ice_Harley.
2011-05-12T03:24:51  <Frontier> antimatroid: If I get super-motivated this week ... who knows, maybe the ants will have a comeback
2011-05-12T03:25:18  <antimatroid> that would be neat, but not sure how easy it will be to watch :P
2011-05-12T03:25:55  <Frontier> first of all, this would be a mode that is activated by the highest zoom level only

2011-05-12T03:48:51  <janzert> basically if you have a server_info.py in your worker directory the sandbox will attempt to use secure mode by default
2011-05-12T03:49:28  <janzert> you can set secure_jail to False in the server_info to disable that
2011-05-12T03:51:02  <Frontier> ah thank you, janzert. I'll disable that flag there.

2011-05-12T06:06:08  <berak> thanks, nice visualizer ! ( though 1.replay does not show player names, but 2 does )
2011-05-12T06:06:27  <Frontier> oh then update your copy plz, there were changes again
2011-05-12T06:06:42  <berak> and my replay( http://pastebin.com/0Guz3FM3 ) differs pretty much
2011-05-12T06:08:23  <Frontier> yes it does. no problem though. the engine guys are free to add whatever meta data they want
2011-05-12T06:09:45  <Frontier> If an addition is useful to the visualizer it may become official. (I add the description of the data field to the wiki page about the replay format.)

2011-05-12T06:11:25  <teuneboon> hi all
2011-05-12T06:12:17  <teuneboon> I want to get started a bit with genetic programming, anyone has tips for me?(I know the theory behind it, but I just don't have a lot of practical examples)
2011-05-12T06:13:16  <antimatroid> there was a genetic bot for planet wars, but they never released the code
2011-05-12T06:13:24  <Frontier> teuneboon: Do you want to participate in this challenge?
2011-05-12T06:13:29  <teuneboon> yeah
2011-05-12T06:14:37  <teuneboon> I know that a basic fitness function could simply be the amount of ants you have at the end
2011-05-12T06:14:46  <teuneboon> or maybe in relation to the other players
2011-05-12T06:14:50  <teuneboon> would be better :P
2011-05-12T06:15:18  <Frontier> the bot antimatroid mentions was a good start. they had a program that generates generations of bots that were checked against their parents and siblings i think.
2011-05-12T06:15:19  <teuneboon> but I just don't know where to start with the other stuff XD
2011-05-12T06:15:36  <antimatroid> i would be more inclined to try and train parameters for something more focused
2011-05-12T06:15:46  <Frontier> they used rather simple instructions, no loops or function calls iirc.
2011-05-12T06:16:24  <antimatroid> you are guaranteed to generate a lot of interest in your bot if it's even half decent though
2011-05-12T06:16:28  <antimatroid> people lap that stuff up
2011-05-12T06:16:47  <teuneboon> yeah, and I have enough time, I hope :P
2011-05-12T06:16:54  <Frontier> there were a lot of "if"s in their bots, or rather ternary operators (? :)
2011-05-12T06:17:29  <teuneboon> k, did they use some genetic programming framework or just wrote it entirely by themselves?
2011-05-12T06:17:46  <antimatroid> i think they did it all themselves
2011-05-12T06:17:50  <Frontier> It looked like garbage, but it played acceptable and ranked higher than my bot in the end
2011-05-12T06:18:00  <antimatroid> the reason they gave for not releasing the code was because they want to use it for work related stufff
2011-05-12T06:18:08  <antimatroid> did they release the code in the end?
2011-05-12T06:18:14  <antimatroid> you make it sound like you've looked at it :p
2011-05-12T06:18:25  <Frontier> no, they shoowed off some bot code
2011-05-12T06:18:33  <antimatroid> ahh, ok
2011-05-12T06:18:45  <Frontier> and i looked at that of course! it was really interesting
2011-05-12T06:18:52  <teuneboon> ok, I'll just start simple and build it up from there :P
2011-05-12T06:19:05  <antimatroid> teuneboon: I have no idea about implementing them, but a place to start would perhaps be to write various heuristic bots that place emphasis on say collecting food, defending, attacking etc.
2011-05-12T06:19:19  <antimatroid> then try to train it to select when it's better to use what kind of bot or something
2011-05-12T06:19:26  <Frontier> do that, you'll see that you need a lot of processing power if you use complicated structures, like loops
2011-05-12T06:19:42  <antimatroid> possibly even allow the bots to update what each individual heuristic bot focusses on from training data
2011-05-12T06:19:45  <teuneboon> well, I got 2 servers and quite a fast PC
2011-05-12T06:19:46  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T06:20:04  <antimatroid> games have ridiculously big state spaces :P
2011-05-12T06:20:39  <teuneboon> I think I'll make a simple food collector first
2011-05-12T06:20:42  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T06:20:49  <teuneboon> looks like the most simple bot
2011-05-12T06:20:50  <antimatroid> food collection is the first serious problem to tackle
2011-05-12T06:20:57  <antimatroid> and there are some neat ways to do it
2011-05-12T06:21:27  <antimatroid> i haven't seen anyone successfully do anything significant other than food collection yet
2011-05-12T06:21:29  <Frontier> I would not let a genetic algorithm generate a path finding algorithm for me. there are perfect examples on the net already.
2011-05-12T06:21:36  <antimatroid> but that's to be expected before it even starts :p
2011-05-12T06:21:53  <antimatroid> Frontier: part of the fun of these contests is learning :p
2011-05-12T06:21:54  <teuneboon> yeah frontier, I got just use dijkstra for that
2011-05-12T06:22:10  <antimatroid> just use a queue :P
2011-05-12T06:22:55  <antimatroid> bfs is about as good as you will do
2011-05-12T06:23:02  <antimatroid> if you have a target destination, then use A*
2011-05-12T06:23:08  <teuneboon> do you guys think I should make each seperate ant a program or the entire program as one
2011-05-12T06:23:15  <antimatroid> you don't have a choice
2011-05-12T06:23:17  <teuneboon> I mean: each ant a program sounds simpler
2011-05-12T06:23:20  <antimatroid> all ants are controlled by the one program
2011-05-12T06:23:36  *** GeorgeSebastian <GeorgeSebastian!~georgeSeb@unaffiliated/georgesebastian> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-05-12T06:23:59  <antimatroid> originally we wanted to force each ant to have its own process, but the overhead for that makes it infeasible
2011-05-12T06:24:23  <Frontier> To be honest that isn't technically feasible. There are now ~1000 ants in one game. We cannot spawn and kill so many processes.
2011-05-12T06:24:26  <antimatroid> that way people would need to develop their own ways for ants to communicate within the rules of the game, it would be quite neat
2011-05-12T06:24:40  <teuneboon> indeed it would be
2011-05-12T06:24:53  <antimatroid> are you a game theory fan?
2011-05-12T06:25:05  <antimatroid> i need moar game theory fans around here :(
2011-05-12T06:25:10  <teuneboon> not even that much, I like AI stuff :P
2011-05-12T06:25:43  <antimatroid> i got into the ai stuff while playing around with game theory, but the ai stuff is fun by itself
2011-05-12T06:26:55  <teuneboon> another fun thing btw: I'm going to try to write it in javascript ^^
2011-05-12T06:27:04  <Frontier> oh be welcome
2011-05-12T06:27:05  <teuneboon> nodeJS ftw :P
2011-05-12T06:28:00  <Frontier> Do you know how slow that might be?
2011-05-12T06:28:44  <teuneboon> hmm, js is quite fast actually
2011-05-12T06:28:58  <Frontier> ah it is the thing Google Chrome uses. Great stuff.
2011-05-12T06:29:02  <teuneboon> yeah
2011-05-12T06:29:16  <teuneboon> in my experience even faster than Java :P
2011-05-12T06:29:41  <teuneboon> but that might be because js has some neat programming tricks with it's functional programming aspects :)
2011-05-12T06:29:51  <Frontier> I use the Rhino JS engine to use the ants visualizer in a standalone app. It is horribly slow :p
2011-05-12T06:31:16  <antimatroid> even faster than java :P
2011-05-12T06:31:25  <antimatroid> that's like saying you can run 100m faster than a tortoise

2011-05-12T06:34:36  <antimatroid> be a turtle
2011-05-12T06:34:42  <Frontier> i like turtles
2011-05-12T06:34:42  <antimatroid> pendown
2011-05-12T06:34:49  <sigh> o_O
2011-05-12T06:34:50  <antimatroid> microworlds anyone?
2011-05-12T06:34:59  <Frontier> no what is it?
2011-05-12T06:35:06  <antimatroid> some thing we had on macs in year 7
2011-05-12T06:35:25  <antimatroid> and my schools pathetic attempt at teaching us what programming is was to get a turtle to draw stars
2011-05-12T06:35:57  <teuneboon> XD
2011-05-12T06:36:25  <antimatroid> my school has this stupid idea that giving every student a laptop could be nothing but productive
2011-05-12T06:36:34  <antimatroid> well, i'm not there now, but they still have the opinion
2011-05-12T06:36:45  <sigh> haha
2011-05-12T06:37:24  <antimatroid> it's funny, i think we went from n64 roms in year 7, to snes in year 8 and gameboy (pokemon) in year 10 :P
2011-05-12T06:37:51  <antimatroid> in year 7 they even had a public folder on the server that all of year 7's could access
2011-05-12T06:37:52  <antimatroid> idiots :\
2011-05-12T06:37:58  <Frontier> My sister used to have a Java teacher who created such a turtle program, but he forgot to exit the virtual machine when the window is closed, resulting in big fat java zombie processes accumulating on every students computer
2011-05-12T06:38:27  <antimatroid> i never learnt any proper programming before uni
2011-05-12T06:38:34  <antimatroid> well, microworlds :P
2011-05-12T06:38:43  <sigh> i created programs on my ti-83
2011-05-12T06:38:45  <sigh> that's about it
2011-05-12T06:38:55  <sigh> so that I could be lazy in maths
2011-05-12T06:38:59  <antimatroid> i just played block dude
2011-05-12T06:39:14  <teuneboon> haha, same here sigh
2011-05-12T06:39:18  <teuneboon> but a ti-84 :P
2011-05-12T06:39:20  <antimatroid> i haven't taken my calculator to uni yet this year
2011-05-12T06:39:23  <Frontier> haha, yes and I forgot that they eat battery juice even when the display is off as long as a program is running
2011-05-12T06:39:29  <sigh> :)
2011-05-12T06:39:32  <teuneboon> created stuff like snake on it
2011-05-12T06:39:33  <teuneboon> XD
2011-05-12T06:39:39  <Frontier> me too, funny
2011-05-12T06:39:41  <antimatroid> i haven't touched a graphics calculator since year 12
2011-05-12T06:39:51  <antimatroid> snake on a torus?
2011-05-12T06:40:02  <antimatroid> klein bottle <3
2011-05-12T06:40:07  <sigh> i had to use my graphics in uni a bit
2011-05-12T06:40:14  <antimatroid> for what?
2011-05-12T06:40:20  <antimatroid> i'm not allowed to
2011-05-12T06:40:20  <Frontier> i did a curved snake, where you only use right/left to steer the snake
2011-05-12T06:40:24  <teuneboon> someone should make an ants bot that acts like a snake XD
2011-05-12T06:40:27  <teuneboon> yeah, same Frontier
2011-05-12T06:40:30  <teuneboon> but it was slow :P
2011-05-12T06:40:36  <antimatroid> teuneboon: i will, but it's slightly complicated
2011-05-12T06:40:41  <sigh> i did engineering... a lot of my subjects allowed calc
2011-05-12T06:40:43  <antimatroid> you need to work out what to do when it's broken up
2011-05-12T06:40:44  <Frontier> shit, no. you had the same idea?
2011-05-12T06:40:58  <teuneboon> split the snake
2011-05-12T06:41:00  <teuneboon> into 2 snakes
2011-05-12T06:41:01  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T06:41:06  <antimatroid> Frontier: i believe mcleopold won the race to snake bot
2011-05-12T06:41:18  <Frontier> uh no, i didnt split my snake
2011-05-12T06:41:34  <antimatroid> no, but what do you do when an enemy comes along and splits the middle?
2011-05-12T06:41:34  <Frontier> antimatroid: mcleopold definitly won any animal bot race
2011-05-12T06:42:17  <Frontier> oh you were talking about ant snakes *confused*
2011-05-12T06:42:41  <teuneboon> haha
2011-05-12T06:42:45  <antimatroid> i had a random idea for a game the other night
2011-05-12T06:43:10  <teuneboon> I always have random ideas :P
2011-05-12T06:43:11  <Frontier> teuneboon: I also let the poor calculator render 3d wireframes of a rotating house - THAT was slow
2011-05-12T06:43:12  <teuneboon> for games
2011-05-12T06:43:19  <antimatroid> if you move onto a neutral square, it's your colour, and you get a single ant on every square of your colour every turn, if you walk onto a square of another colour, it turns into your colour
2011-05-12T06:43:19  <teuneboon> XD
2011-05-12T06:43:28  <antimatroid> it's like floodfill wars
2011-05-12T06:44:03  <sigh> antimatroid: like this but 2 players? http://floodit.appspot.com/
2011-05-12T06:44:39  <sigh> i suppose it is a bit different
2011-05-12T06:44:49  <antimatroid> oh, hell yeah
2011-05-12T06:44:55  <antimatroid> people's moves should flood fill
2011-05-12T06:44:58  <antimatroid> that'd be awesome
2011-05-12T06:45:04  <sigh> I wrote a solver for that
2011-05-12T06:45:17  <antimatroid> was the solution neat?
2011-05-12T06:45:47  <Frontier> ...oh bad minecraft memories
2011-05-12T06:46:01  <sigh> fairly straightforward, model it as a graph and you try to reach every node
2011-05-12T06:46:01  <antimatroid> haha
2011-05-12T06:46:20  <Frontier> "hey, im up here on the mountain with a can of lava... oops empty can of lava"
2011-05-12T06:46:26  <antimatroid> so you basically just searched for a solution?
2011-05-12T06:46:26  <sigh> apply heuristics to make it faster
2011-05-12T06:46:35  <sigh> yes
2011-05-12T06:46:49  <sigh> with some tricks to make the data structure easy to update
2011-05-12T06:46:49  <antimatroid> how big could it solve?
2011-05-12T06:47:13  <antimatroid> have you tried the 4-colourable grids problem?
2011-05-12T06:47:46  <sigh> I think after about 12x12 it was only fast enough to give heuristic solutions (in a under a min)
2011-05-12T06:48:01  <antimatroid> http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/11/17x17-challenge-worth-28900-this-is-not.html
2011-05-12T06:48:09  <antimatroid> that is the 4-colourable problem i refer to
2011-05-12T06:48:52  <sigh> no, haven't tried it
2011-05-12T06:49:21  <antimatroid> i had a few goes, i got so far as to try stitching stuff together
2011-05-12T06:49:24  <antimatroid> but never got anything
2011-05-12T06:51:24  <antimatroid> like if you can find a valid 1-partial colour with more that 1/4 of the squares filled, you can then try to build valid 2-partial colours and so on
2011-05-12T06:51:55  <teuneboon> 'fitness': function() { 		return this.myAnts().length; 	}
2011-05-12T06:51:59  <teuneboon> XD
2011-05-12T06:52:00  <sigh> that's an interesting approach
2011-05-12T06:54:25  <teuneboon> hmm, I'm thinking, what parameters do I put in the DNA string of my genetic bot?
2011-05-12T06:54:43  <teuneboon> only direction is not very much lol XD
2011-05-12T06:55:02  <sigh> you are doing genetic algorithms?
2011-05-12T06:55:14  <teuneboon> yeah, trying
2011-05-12T06:55:20  <teuneboon> but haven't got a lot experience in it yet
2011-05-12T06:55:28  <teuneboon> so don't expect it to succeed soon :P
2011-05-12T06:55:31  <sigh> :)
2011-05-12T06:55:57  <teuneboon> well, *** it, I'm going to start with only direction in the dna string
2011-05-12T06:55:58  <teuneboon> XD
2011-05-12T06:56:26  <sigh> maybe try genetically encoding a decision tree?
2011-05-12T06:57:11  <teuneboon> hmm, I'll just start simple :P
2011-05-12T06:57:15  <teuneboon> with a very stupid bot
2011-05-12T06:57:18  <teuneboon> ^^
2011-05-12T06:57:23  <sigh> :)
2011-05-12T07:16:14  <antimatroid> teuneboon: did you participate in tron or planet wars?
2011-05-12T07:16:28  <teuneboon> I did in planet wars, but wasn't very active there
2011-05-12T07:16:32  <teuneboon> didn't have the time
2011-05-12T07:16:44  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-05-12T07:16:50  <antimatroid> i managed to find plenty of time for planet wars
2011-05-12T07:16:54  <antimatroid> not so sure for ants
2011-05-12T07:17:47  <teuneboon> I know I have enough time for ants :P
2011-05-12T07:18:04  <antimatroid> summer?
2011-05-12T07:18:15  <teuneboon> since after summer holiday on school I get: PHP, MySQL and English
2011-05-12T07:18:16  <antimatroid> it's bloody cold where i live atm
2011-05-12T07:18:19  <teuneboon> so stupid
2011-05-12T07:18:29  <antimatroid> are you at uni?
2011-05-12T07:18:30  <teuneboon> I'm good at all 3 of them :P
2011-05-12T07:18:35  <teuneboon> well, 1 level below uni
2011-05-12T07:18:41  <teuneboon> dunno how you call it in English
2011-05-12T07:18:49  <antimatroid> depends, i call it college
2011-05-12T07:18:51  <teuneboon> I don't like the purely theoretical side of the uni :P
2011-05-12T07:18:53  <antimatroid> but america calls that uni
2011-05-12T07:19:03  * antimatroid is a pure maths student :(
2011-05-12T07:19:29  <teuneboon> well, here we have 3 levels: MBO(pure practical), HBO(practical and theoretical) and Uni(pure theory)
2011-05-12T07:19:36  <teuneboon> I do computer science :P
2011-05-12T07:21:19  <teuneboon> killParents variable, evil :P
2011-05-12T07:23:16  <mcstar> i decided to try GA this week as well
2011-05-12T07:23:25  <teuneboon> nice
2011-05-12T07:23:37  <mcstar> but i guess it will be a LOT of work
2011-05-12T07:23:48  <teuneboon> yeah, I think so too
2011-05-12T07:23:54  <mcstar> as far as i can see, i have to write my own engine adn visualizer
2011-05-12T07:24:02  <teuneboon> I do it more for learning it
2011-05-12T07:24:13  <teuneboon> and not for winning
2011-05-12T07:24:16  <teuneboon> might make 2 bots: 1 GP
2011-05-12T07:24:18  <teuneboon> and 1 normal one
2011-05-12T07:24:20  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T07:24:27  <mcstar> im all for the win
2011-05-12T07:24:30  <mcstar> :D
2011-05-12T07:25:01  <teuneboon> haha, I almost have a bot now that randomly chooses a direction for every ant every turn XD
2011-05-12T07:25:12  <mcstar> i have one too
2011-05-12T07:25:13  <teuneboon> without knowing anything about it's surroundings :P
2011-05-12T07:25:17  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-12T07:25:27  <mcstar> but doesnt step on food or his peers
2011-05-12T07:25:59  <mcstar> for a couple of days im just meditating on this subject
2011-05-12T07:26:38  <mcstar> the problem is what to consider an entity
2011-05-12T07:26:58  <mcstar> what exactly your population will consist of
2011-05-12T07:27:18  <teuneboon> yeah, idd
2011-05-12T07:27:18  <mcstar> this part will be tricky to decide
2011-05-12T07:28:33  <mcstar> do you plan to use mpi?
2011-05-12T07:29:16  <teuneboon> nope, I'm just a beginner in GP
2011-05-12T07:29:22  <teuneboon> so I make something myself
2011-05-12T07:29:25  <teuneboon> something very simple ^^
2011-05-12T07:29:29  <teuneboon> in javascript :P
2011-05-12T07:30:16  <mcstar> i might have to use it, cause i might have to distribute the payload on several processors
2011-05-12T07:30:36  <mcstar> i guess it will be very CPU hungry
2011-05-12T07:31:18  <mcstar> im not an expert in js, but i beleive it runs in browsers
2011-05-12T07:31:26  <mcstar> arent you limited by that too much?
2011-05-12T07:31:50  <mcstar> i cant possibly imagine to evolve a population on a js scale
2011-05-12T07:31:55  <teuneboon> nodejs
2011-05-12T07:32:01  <teuneboon> server side javascript
2011-05-12T07:32:03  <teuneboon> very fast
2011-05-12T07:32:04  <teuneboon> :)
2011-05-12T07:32:09  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-12T07:32:18  <mcstar> multithreading?
2011-05-12T07:32:25  <teuneboon> that's harder ^^
2011-05-12T07:32:41  <teuneboon> but well, I'm not really in it to win
2011-05-12T07:32:44  <teuneboon> just to learn :)
2011-05-12T07:33:09  <teuneboon> and webworkers are possible in js
2011-05-12T07:33:12  <teuneboon> so might do something with that
2011-05-12T07:33:34  <mcstar> whats that?
2011-05-12T07:34:05  <teuneboon> from the specification: "This specification defines an API that allows Web application authors to spawn background workers running scripts in parallel to their main page. This allows for thread-like operation with message-passing as the coordination mechanism."
2011-05-12T07:34:24  <mcstar> i see
2011-05-12T07:35:23  <mcstar> well, good luck
2011-05-12T07:35:31  <teuneboon> thanks, you 2

2011-05-12T07:55:07  <teuneboon> mcstar, do you know a solution for the fact that the amount of ants is variable? I was thinking about making a dna-part for every ant, but might have to use a decision tree if that doesn't work out
2011-05-12T08:06:26  <mcstar> well
2011-05-12T08:06:31  <teuneboon> ok, I'm going to do decision tree, already decided :P
2011-05-12T08:06:37  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-12T08:06:39  <mcstar> im not
2011-05-12T08:06:47  <teuneboon> made a very, very simple one
2011-05-12T08:06:55  <teuneboon> which basicly makes a move according to what turn it is
2011-05-12T08:07:20  <teuneboon> what are you doing then?
2011-05-12T08:07:37  <mcstar> i dont know if i want to tell it
2011-05-12T08:07:40  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-12T08:07:49  <teuneboon> haha, ok, np ;)
2011-05-12T08:07:53  <mcstar> its just an idea
2011-05-12T08:08:13  <mcstar> but im have to build a framework first of all
2011-05-12T08:08:16  <mcstar> -m
2011-05-12T08:08:34  <teuneboon> yeah, I found one on the internet which I just adjusted a bit
2011-05-12T08:08:37  <teuneboon> and now it works for me :)
2011-05-12T08:08:39  <mcstar> right now im using a game engine in common lisp to get some visualization
2011-05-12T08:08:47  <teuneboon> ah, lisp
2011-05-12T08:08:56  <teuneboon> that's damn hard(at least for me)
2011-05-12T08:09:19  <mcstar> its only appearance
2011-05-12T08:09:38  <teuneboon> had Haskell in school, was already happy with a 6/10
2011-05-12T08:09:45  *** FireFly <FireFly!~firefly@unaffiliated/firefly> has quit IRC (Quit: swatted to death)
2011-05-12T08:09:48  <teuneboon> I'm not good at purely functional programming languages
2011-05-12T08:09:58  <mcstar> lisp isnt
2011-05-12T08:10:00  <mcstar> thank god
2011-05-12T08:10:04  <teuneboon> oh lol
2011-05-12T08:10:21  <mcstar> i would get nowhere if i wanted purely (almost ) functional style
2011-05-12T08:10:29  <teuneboon> ah, it's logical language?
2011-05-12T08:10:36  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-12T08:10:50  <teuneboon> nvm XD
2011-05-12T08:11:08  <mcstar> its a language from what every other spawned (except c and fortran)
2011-05-12T08:11:48  <Ice_Harley> Frontier: are you here? When I run play_one_game.bat with 4 TimeoutBots visualizer gives me error: "replaydata.ants.0.6.length should be within [3 .. 4], but was found to be 2!"
2011-05-12T08:12:07  <mcstar> had that too
2011-05-12T08:12:20  <mcstar> maybe one of the bots didnt quit prioperly
2011-05-12T08:12:26  <mcstar> -i
2011-05-12T08:12:27  <Ice_Harley> Frontier: here is replay data http://pastebin.com/saqNzPmS
2011-05-12T08:13:07  <mcstar> teuneboon: so its a multi-paradigm language
2011-05-12T08:13:29  <mcstar> but has some constructs that even recent languages dont have
2011-05-12T08:13:52  <teuneboon> oh ok, well, I'm keeping it at imperative programming languages XD
2011-05-12T08:14:00  <teuneboon> well, and javascript, but that's mostly imperative too
2011-05-12T08:14:01  <teuneboon> :)
2011-05-12T08:14:24  <mcstar> i heard js is very functional
2011-05-12T08:14:37  <teuneboon> it is, but it's not like haskell or something like that
2011-05-12T08:16:19  <sigh> js makes it easy to work with and manipulate functions
2011-05-12T08:16:29  <teuneboon> yeah, that's why I like it :P
2011-05-12T08:16:39  <sigh> yeah, I like that too
2011-05-12T08:16:47  <teuneboon> and with callbacks made easy, scopes etc.
2011-05-12T08:16:49  <sigh> I hate the horrendously weak typing
2011-05-12T08:16:53  <teuneboon> can make it very elegant
2011-05-12T08:17:13  <jbroman> Proper lexical scoping is a god-send in JavaScript.
2011-05-12T08:17:30  <teuneboon> yeah, I hate it when you read a user input and you do a + b(where a and b are both numbers filled in by the user) it handles them as strings :P
2011-05-12T08:17:50  <sigh> teuneboon: exactly!
2011-05-12T08:17:59  <teuneboon> always parseInt damnit :P
2011-05-12T08:17:59  <jbroman> sigh: You seen what PHP does with types?
2011-05-12T08:18:08  <mcstar> does js have closures?
2011-05-12T08:18:19  <sigh> jbroman: I try to erase my mind of anything related to php
2011-05-12T08:18:21  <sigh> mcstar: tes
2011-05-12T08:18:24  <jbroman> mcstar: Yes.
2011-05-12T08:18:24  <sigh> *yes
2011-05-12T08:18:33  <mcstar> +1
2011-05-12T08:18:51  <jbroman> "a" == 0 in PHP :)
2011-05-12T08:18:59  <teuneboon> ^^
2011-05-12T08:19:31  <sigh> jbroman: ah yes... == doesn't mean anything meaningful in php
2011-05-12T08:20:01  <teuneboon> also fun, if you do: class Test { function lol(int $i) { return $i + 1; } } in php, and you call the function lol in that class it says: invalid parameter, int expected, int given
2011-05-12T08:20:10  <teuneboon> but that's because int $i is already invalid ^^
2011-05-12T08:20:16  <sigh> :)
2011-05-12T08:21:05  <sigh> oh one thing with js closures... if you aren't careful with closures you can create cyclic references which aren't handled well in all browsers
2011-05-12T08:26:11  <teuneboon> lol, forgot for a moment that nodejs reads files async :P
2011-05-12T08:26:20  <teuneboon> really was like: wtf, why does this crash

2011-05-12T09:12:08  <teuneboon> a bot the genetically decided after how many turns it has to turn and to which direction XD
2011-05-12T09:12:23  <teuneboon> only 1 turn allowed, so it kinda fails :P

2011-05-12T10:03:55  <berak> teuneboon, it's a bit of work, but you can retrieve the ants count / scores from the replay
2011-05-12T10:04:08  <teuneboon> I already made a workaround
2011-05-12T10:04:15  <berak> ;)
2011-05-12T10:04:19  <teuneboon> just disabled the check if someone is still alive
2011-05-12T10:04:21  <teuneboon> hardcoded XD
2011-05-12T10:05:12  <berak> won't that break your gameplay ?
2011-05-12T10:05:21  <teuneboon> apperantly not
2011-05-12T10:05:27  <teuneboon> dunno how it should anyway?
2011-05-12T10:05:53  <teuneboon> the bot is probably told nothing but the turn, since it has no line of sight left
2011-05-12T10:05:59  <teuneboon> but that's no problem for me
2011-05-12T10:08:42  <berak> the number of ants alive at the end may not be the best fitness indicator, it's the score, that counts
2011-05-12T10:09:19  <teuneboon> yeah, score in comparision to the other scores
2011-05-12T10:09:25  <teuneboon> that's even better :P
2011-05-12T10:10:07  <berak> any ant alive in the end is wasted, it did not kill another ..
2011-05-12T10:10:37  <teuneboon> it was just a test fitness :P
2011-05-12T10:11:02  <teuneboon> I mean, the bot is quite bad atm, it can only make 1 decision, in the entire game XD
2011-05-12T10:11:14  <teuneboon> oh, and it can choose WHEN to make that decision XD
2011-05-12T10:17:39  <berak> free willy !
2011-05-12T10:19:40  <teuneboon> yeah, going to make it possible for it to make 1..* decision in the game :)

2011-05-12T11:24:46  <teuneboon> not implemented yet?
2011-05-12T11:24:49  <teuneboon> it's just so weird
2011-05-12T11:24:52  <teuneboon> it is in the log
2011-05-12T11:24:54  <mcstar> i discussed it already with the Bosses
2011-05-12T11:25:10  <teuneboon> it's a bug?
2011-05-12T11:25:12  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T11:25:18  <mcstar> as far as i know the engine doesnt send the end message to the players
2011-05-12T11:25:24  <teuneboon> -_-
2011-05-12T11:25:35  <mcstar> i use turns as an exit condition
2011-05-12T11:26:19  <mcstar> but my information is based on at least a week old pull
2011-05-12T11:26:42  <teuneboon> k, mine too
2011-05-12T11:28:16  <teuneboon> and what if you are eliminated before the end?
2011-05-12T11:28:20  <teuneboon> how do you catch that then?
2011-05-12T11:30:22  <teuneboon> cause my bot is screwed if it's eliminated
2011-05-12T11:30:27  <teuneboon> since it doesn't evolve anymore
2011-05-12T11:30:36  <teuneboon> and is eliminated again and again
2011-05-12T11:30:37  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T11:37:08  <mcstar> the engine simply terminates ur program
2011-05-12T11:37:17  <mcstar> kill -15
2011-05-12T11:37:27  <mcstar> something of the same effect
2011-05-12T11:37:33  <teuneboon> so you can't save your population then?
2011-05-12T11:37:35  <teuneboon> that's lame XD
2011-05-12T11:37:39  <mcstar> no
2011-05-12T11:38:05  <mcstar> and the bots cant access the outside world either, no files, sockets anything
2011-05-12T11:38:13  <mcstar> only stdin/out
2011-05-12T11:38:21  <mcstar> but thats bound to the enfine
2011-05-12T11:38:22  <mcstar> g
2011-05-12T11:38:32  <teuneboon> I know, but I'm going to train it locally
2011-05-12T11:38:42  <teuneboon> and then just at the end take the one with the best fitness
2011-05-12T11:38:45  <teuneboon> and put it in hardcoded
2011-05-12T11:38:54  <mcstar> thats why i said i need to make an own engine and visualizer
2011-05-12T11:39:03  <teuneboon> oh ok :P
2011-05-12T11:39:14  <teuneboon> don't you think it will be fixed?
2011-05-12T11:39:17  <teuneboon> I can save files now
2011-05-12T11:39:22  <mcstar> it doesnt matter
2011-05-12T11:39:29  <mcstar> its in python
2011-05-12T11:39:35  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T11:39:38  <teuneboon> not fast enough? :P
2011-05-12T11:39:39  <mcstar> and the the engine doesnt run on full power
2011-05-12T11:39:47  <mcstar> it gives time slices to the bots
2011-05-12T11:40:07  <mcstar> but i need an enviromnet where they can run as fast as hell
2011-05-12T11:40:28  <teuneboon> just did a pull btw, bug not fixed :
2011-05-12T11:40:29  <teuneboon> :(
2011-05-12T11:40:59  <teuneboon> there's no timeout in the engine...
2011-05-12T11:41:16  <teuneboon> I mean: no sleep
2011-05-12T11:41:27  <McLeopold> There is a little sleep
2011-05-12T11:41:33  <teuneboon> where?
2011-05-12T11:41:39  <teuneboon> can't seem to find it :P
2011-05-12T11:41:41  <McLeopold> when waiting for bot moves
2011-05-12T11:43:03  <berak> your bot is pending 75% of the time (for 4 players) waiting for the input of the other 3
2011-05-12T11:43:13  <teuneboon> ah, like that
2011-05-12T11:43:25  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/engine.py#L266
2011-05-12T11:43:43  <teuneboon> and if you remove that?
2011-05-12T11:43:45  <teuneboon> what happens? :P
2011-05-12T11:44:00  <McLeopold> you can turn off the serial bot stuff
2011-05-12T11:44:34  <teuneboon> parser.add_option("--serial", dest="serial",                       action="store_true",                       help="Run bots in serial, instead of parallel.")
2011-05-12T11:44:35  <McLeopold> pass 'serial': False to the engine
2011-05-12T11:44:42  <teuneboon> ok
2011-05-12T11:45:29  <McLeopold> if you are using playgame.py, it is off by default
2011-05-12T11:45:39  <teuneboon> yeah, already thought so :P
2011-05-12T11:46:14  <teuneboon> but do you happen to know if the "end" bug is being fixed already? :P
2011-05-12T11:46:21  <McLeopold> also, if the other bots don't use the full second, then you may not be waiting much time
2011-05-12T11:46:28  <McLeopold> let me look
2011-05-12T11:49:18  <McLeopold> without the serial stuff, it should be sending
2011-05-12T11:49:28  <teuneboon> hmm, it isn't here :(
2011-05-12T11:49:37  <McLeopold> is your bot logging input?
2011-05-12T11:49:39  <teuneboon> or I'll retry
2011-05-12T11:49:41  <teuneboon> 1 sec
2011-05-12T11:49:45  <teuneboon> yes, it logs the input
2011-05-12T11:49:49  <teuneboon> and the "end" shows there
2011-05-12T11:50:01  <McLeopold> ok, then, it works
2011-05-12T11:50:01  <teuneboon> but when I make a custom logger
2011-05-12T11:50:07  <teuneboon> it doesn't show
2011-05-12T11:50:08  <teuneboon> ok
2011-05-12T11:50:13  *** orivej <orivej!~orivej@host-46-146-66-217.spbmts.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-12T11:50:16  <McLeopold> it might be a timing issue
2011-05-12T11:50:37  <teuneboon> k
2011-05-12T11:51:21  <McLeopold> the bot gets send the end stuff before it is written to the engine input logs
2011-05-12T11:51:28  <teuneboon> ah, I think it works now, let me try some stuff
2011-05-12T11:51:42  <McLeopold> so, if it's there, your bot probably got it...
2011-05-12T11:52:10  <McLeopold> but, the engine kills the bot instantly after it sends the info, so you may not have time to process it
2011-05-12T11:52:23  <teuneboon> hmm
2011-05-12T11:52:41  <teuneboon> that's kinda weird then isn't it? send and kill before it can process
2011-05-12T11:52:50  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T11:52:54  <teuneboon> how can anyone ever process the final data then? XD
2011-05-12T11:53:00  <McLeopold> i'll fix it
2011-05-12T11:53:08  <teuneboon> k
2011-05-12T11:53:09  <mcstar> whats the point in processing it?
2011-05-12T11:53:16  <mcstar> can you do anything with it?
2011-05-12T11:53:27  <teuneboon> well, maybe you want to take the data that's in there in the fitness fucntion?
2011-05-12T11:53:39  <berak> ah, btw, what kind of bot-behaviour is actually punished, and in which way ?, timeouts, moving into water, your own ant, etc ?
2011-05-12T11:54:02  <McLeopold> not much punishment, since it is multi-player
2011-05-12T11:54:08  <mcstar> teuneboon: i dont really see how can u evolve ur bot
2011-05-12T11:54:29  <mcstar> i mean, dont u need an ensemble of entities?
2011-05-12T11:54:38  <berak> so, that's how 'ignored' moves come in ?
2011-05-12T11:54:41  <teuneboon> well, this is how I do it:
2011-05-12T11:54:41  <McLeopold> timeouts and crashes will cause your bot to just hold every turn, and you may still get new ants, but no points
2011-05-12T11:54:48  <teuneboon> I have a decision tree
2011-05-12T11:55:00  <berak> k.
2011-05-12T11:55:00  <teuneboon> it's the same for every ant
2011-05-12T11:55:25  <teuneboon> this can be dynamicly generated by evolution
2011-05-12T11:55:25  <teuneboon> so it can add "nodes" to it
2011-05-12T11:55:25  <teuneboon> etc.
2011-05-12T11:55:25  <McLeopold> The point is to make the other bots incapable of seeing the difference between a dead and live bot
2011-05-12T11:56:15  <teuneboon> then on every move it simply walks through the decision tree
2011-05-12T11:56:15  <teuneboon> for every ant
2011-05-12T11:56:24  <McLeopold> mcstar: I don't know how you would evolve one either, but someone may figure it out, so we will send ending info.
2011-05-12T11:58:37  <teuneboon> you can evolve one by letting the program create if constructions by itself :P
2011-05-12T11:58:43  <teuneboon> and if constructions within those if constructions
2011-05-12T11:58:46  <teuneboon> etc. etc.
2011-05-12T11:59:42  <McLeopold> berak: in order to pass the functional test, you will need to not send invalid orders, but it will not crash you bot when in a game
2011-05-12T11:59:51  <McLeopold> this is the 'strict' mode of the engine
2011-05-12T12:01:58  <berak> ah, another flag explained ;)
2011-05-12T12:12:01  <berak> man i'm just trying to get an online
2011-05-12T12:12:42  <berak> *oww kill that

2011-05-12T15:26:14  <teuneboon> McLeopold , is it possible that even after a pull I still can't read teh "end" line?
2011-05-12T15:26:31  <teuneboon> I put in a sleep of 1 sec
2011-05-12T15:26:45  <teuneboon> and it just seems to pause my script too XD
2011-05-12T15:27:43  <McLeopold> ?
2011-05-12T15:28:10  <teuneboon> the newest update put a pause in on the "end" line
2011-05-12T15:28:12  <teuneboon> or well
2011-05-12T15:28:16  <McLeopold> it should call bot.resume() before sending the ending info
2011-05-12T15:28:16  <teuneboon> when the program stops
2011-05-12T15:29:11  <teuneboon> if bots_eliminated and end_wait:                     verbose_log.write('waiting {0} seconds for bots to process end turn\n'.format(end_wait))                     time.sleep(end_wait)                     for b in bots_eliminated:                         bots[b].pause()
2011-05-12T15:29:18  <teuneboon> I only see pause?
2011-05-12T15:29:56  <teuneboon> and that's before ending info
2011-05-12T15:30:30  <McLeopold> that's if you were eliminated, not if you survived
2011-05-12T15:31:03  <McLeopold> just above that line is where they are resumed
2011-05-12T15:31:29  <teuneboon> ah, I see
2011-05-12T15:31:35  <teuneboon> hmm, why doesn't it work for me :(
2011-05-12T15:31:59  <McLeopold> give end_wait 5 seconds and see if it still is an issue

2011-05-12T15:45:19  <teuneboon> in the start_bot I didn't use filesystem btw
2011-05-12T15:47:03  <McLeopold> okay, and if the starter has issues, it's probably not the problem
2011-05-12T15:48:10  <mcstar> McLeopold: why cant i see stderr now?
2011-05-12T15:48:25  <amstan> someone executed the php starter bot from my dev path, and apache just got in an infinite loop trying to execute it

2011-05-12T15:49:40  <McLeopold> that means it should compress fairly well
2011-05-12T15:50:04  <amstan> yeah, i bet there's a few gb more of them compressed
2011-05-12T15:50:10  <teuneboon> hmm. I noticed something
2011-05-12T15:50:14  <teuneboon> when looking at the stream log
2011-05-12T15:50:18  <teuneboon> I don't see the final "go"
2011-05-12T15:51:00  <teuneboon> in the engine code it's there though
2011-05-12T15:51:25  <teuneboon> oh wait, the stream log doesn't log the go
2011-05-12T15:51:27  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T15:51:56  <McLeopold> maybe it should...
2011-05-12T15:52:22  <teuneboon> yeah, but that's only the log, and not the reason it doesn't work I think?
2011-05-12T15:52:37  <mcstar> McLeopold: so what happened to logging?
2011-05-12T15:52:54  <mcstar> i see a game_logs dir, but the files are empty
2011-05-12T15:52:58  <McLeopold> not sure
2011-05-12T15:53:12  <teuneboon> logging works here
2011-05-12T15:53:17  <mcstar> with the prev. engine my bot logged to stderr nicely
2011-05-12T15:53:32  <McLeopold> amstan: playgame just launched a "browser" and I'm in text mode...
2011-05-12T15:53:41  <amstan> McLeopold: yes.. i know
2011-05-12T15:54:00  <McLeopold> w3m?
2011-05-12T15:54:01  <amstan> one thing i don't understand is why we're using a tool made for developers when we're testing the sandbox on a worker...
2011-05-12T15:54:13  <amstan> it's fine that it opens a browser
2011-05-12T15:54:25  <amstan> because it's for the bot developers, but why are we using it..
2011-05-12T15:54:30  <McLeopold> just unfamilar with the w3m is all
2011-05-12T15:55:06  <McLeopold> you don't have to use it, it's an option
2011-05-12T15:55:32  <McLeopold> the functional test doesn't use it, nor the worker games
2011-05-12T15:55:50  <McLeopold> the code is in playgame, which is a dev only tool
2011-05-12T15:58:17  <McLeopold> amstan: did that make sense?
2011-05-12T15:59:00  <amstan> visualizer is the one launching it
2011-05-12T15:59:38  <amstan> i'm just confused on why we use it to test the workers, how come it uses the sandboxes when it's a dev tool?
2011-05-12T16:00:06  <McLeopold> I guess we need to make playgame not use the sandboxes then
2011-05-12T16:00:24  <McLeopold> but, if people want to see how their code performs in the sandbox, it's useful to have
2011-05-12T16:00:44  <janzert> mcstar: McLeopold reworked how stderr is handled recently, unfortunately one of the things lost was the ability to just leave stderr for the bot alone and going to the console
2011-05-12T16:00:46  <McLeopold> playgame is not to be used for testing workers
2011-05-12T16:00:55  <janzert> amstan: the engine always uses the sandbox internally
2011-05-12T16:01:11  <janzert> it's just a question of if the sandbox actually does any sandboxing :)
2011-05-12T16:01:27  <amstan> hmm
2011-05-12T16:01:28  <amstan> ok
2011-05-12T16:01:40  <McLeopold> janzert: playgame should still be able to pipe a bots stderr to stderr, I think
2011-05-12T16:02:38  <janzert> McLeopold: the sandbox always takes over stderr now and doesn't even read anything from it until after stdout is closed
2011-05-12T16:02:39  <mcstar> well it doesnt for me
2011-05-12T16:02:43  <McLeopold> add a -e or --log_stderr
2011-05-12T16:02:50  <mcstar> tried that
2011-05-12T16:03:18  <McLeopold> janzert: oh, so just turn off the sandboxing then
2011-05-12T16:03:28  <McLeopold> wait...
2011-05-12T16:03:35  <janzert> I mean the sandbox class, the way you rewrote it
2011-05-12T16:03:35  <McLeopold> I'm thinking jail
2011-05-12T16:04:08  <janzert> also if the bot prints more to stderr than the os buffer can handle it will deadlock now
2011-05-12T16:04:55  <teuneboon> zomfg why won't it work :(
2011-05-12T16:05:31  <mcstar> the question is why the logs file are empty?
2011-05-12T16:05:40  <janzert> I added a FIXME comment in the code about that last problem
2011-05-12T16:05:59  <McLeopold> janzert: so we should have an option to pipe a bots stderr to the engine's stderr for testing?

2011-05-12T16:06:36  <janzert> I think that's the nicest yes, and sigh had made the changes before so it was working that way
2011-05-12T16:06:58  <McLeopold> he was just passing the handle to the sandbox
2011-05-12T16:07:11  <McLeopold> which didn't allow for me to capture
2011-05-12T16:07:53  <janzert> and pass PIPE when you needed to captuer
2011-05-12T16:08:03  <McLeopold> my thought was that if a bot crashed, we would capture the last few bytes of stderr to send to the user
2011-05-12T16:08:11  <janzert> but really capturing needs to setup a separate thread for stderr
2011-05-12T16:08:17  <janzert> just like the one for stdout
2011-05-12T16:08:32  <McLeopold> I did that, passed PIPE and setup another Queue object
2011-05-12T16:08:42  <janzert> but not another thread
2011-05-12T16:08:42  <McLeopold> I'm just not attempting to read it during the game
2011-05-12T16:08:47  <janzert> right
2011-05-12T16:09:01  <McLeopold> oh, so a second monitor_process
2011-05-12T16:09:04  <janzert> which will deadlock if the bot writes more than the OS buffer size
2011-05-12T16:09:08  <janzert> yep
2011-05-12T16:09:12  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-12T16:09:59  <janzert> I think easiest/best is to just generalize the monitor_process function to take a file and queue to read from and stuff the data into
2011-05-12T16:10:27  <teuneboon> even if I rmove the bot.kill() it won't read the end line
2011-05-12T16:10:28  <teuneboon> wtf
2011-05-12T16:10:55  <janzert> teuneboon: is the bot stopped/paused at that point?

2011-05-12T16:40:08  <teuneboon> I know, already fixed that here
2011-05-12T16:40:09  <teuneboon> but still
2011-05-12T16:40:15  <teuneboon> it should call the onEnd method
2011-05-12T16:40:16  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-12T16:42:23  <teuneboon> janzert, even if I put bot.resume() a line above that it doesn't work
2011-05-12T16:43:22  <janzert> teuneboon: at that point I would verify that the python bot(s) aren't receiving it either
2011-05-12T16:43:39  <janzert> just to try and narrow down if it's a problem on the engine side or the bot side
2011-05-12T16:43:53  <teuneboon> yeah, mcleopold was trying to do that weren't you leo? :P
2011-05-12T16:44:00  <teuneboon> I can do that too
2011-05-12T16:45:31  <teuneboon> python bot doesn't implement the "end"
2011-05-12T16:47:13  <janzert> ahh, its a sane implementation :P
2011-05-12T16:48:02  <McLeopold> I'm implementing 'end' right now :p
2011-05-12T16:48:07  <teuneboon> k
2011-05-12T16:48:08  <teuneboon> :P
2011-05-12T16:51:10  <teuneboon> hmm, even with input buffering the nodejs bot won't work :(

2011-05-12T17:02:32  <McLeopold> so, we're back to nodejs
2011-05-12T17:02:37  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-12T17:02:39  <mcstar> not really
2011-05-12T17:02:56  <McLeopold> mcstar: you're stderr issue is different
2011-05-12T17:02:59  <mcstar> i tried my cl bot and the cpp
2011-05-12T17:03:01  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-05-12T17:03:17  <McLeopold> mcstar: how are you wanting the stderr to work?
2011-05-12T17:03:39  <mcstar> i dont care if it prints on the console or into a file
2011-05-12T17:03:48  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-12T17:04:06  <mcstar> preferably to the console
2011-05-12T17:04:14  <mcstar> but doesnt really matter
2011-05-12T17:04:43  <McLeopold> with ErrorBot.py, I get stderr to the console, but error bot also crashes
2011-05-12T17:06:13  <teuneboon> well, at least I know where to look now, thanks McLeopold
2011-05-12T17:06:55  <mcstar> ill try errorbot
2011-05-12T17:07:56  <mcstar> aha
2011-05-12T17:08:03  <mcstar> it crashed
2011-05-12T17:08:25  <mcstar> i guess it supposed to crash :)
2011-05-12T17:08:29  <McLeopold> yep :)
2011-05-12T17:08:42  <McLeopold> also, if you log errors to the log dir, you get a 0.botx.error file
2011-05-12T17:08:50  <McLeopold> so it does both stderr and file logging
2011-05-12T17:09:18  <mcstar> nothing
2011-05-12T17:09:22  <McLeopold> The only thing we need to do is separate the stderr into its own monitor process, so you can get ongoing results
2011-05-12T17:09:35  <McLeopold> you on linux then?
2011-05-12T17:09:40  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-12T17:09:59  <teuneboon> hmm, now I think of it, might it be because stdin is async in nodejs?
2011-05-12T17:10:15  <McLeopold> sandbox.py, line 253, add the OSError exception
2011-05-12T17:10:19  <teuneboon> that the stdin stream closes for a very short time or something, and that the nodejs program quits
2011-05-12T17:10:24  <teuneboon> cause it thinks it's "done"
2011-05-12T17:11:27  <teuneboon> I'll just put in a setTimeout to infinity to test it XD
2011-05-12T17:11:27  <McLeopold> mcstar: that will get you to have ErrorBot log to a file as well, but it should have already shown you to the console
2011-05-12T17:12:07  <McLeopold> make sure to pass --log_dir <dir> -E -e to playgame
2011-05-12T17:12:29  <mcstar> not --log_dir=dir ?
2011-05-12T17:12:36  <McLeopold> uppercase E says "log to error file" and lowercase e says send to stderr
2011-05-12T17:12:50  <McLeopold> it's using optparse, so either will work
2011-05-12T17:13:11  <McLeopold> but no <>
2011-05-12T17:13:27  <mcstar> im not that stupid :)
2011-05-12T17:14:31  <mcstar> interesting
2011-05-12T17:15:08  <mcstar> one of the file contains that bot0 timed out
2011-05-12T17:15:22  <mcstar> and the other is contains the exception from errorbot
2011-05-12T17:15:26  <mcstar> -is
2011-05-12T17:16:09  <mcstar> so i run a cl a cpp and 2 python bots
2011-05-12T17:16:18  <mcstar> the cl logs to stderr as well as the cpp bot
2011-05-12T17:16:27  <mcstar> nothing on the screen
2011-05-12T17:16:48  <mcstar> only the errorbots exception can be seen on the screen and in the file
2011-05-12T17:17:07  <mcstar> the cl bot times out, and that can be seen in the logfile as well. but only that
2011-05-12T17:17:30  <mcstar> they should log every input they receive

2011-05-12T17:19:21  <mcstar> McLeopold: when you see logs from the bot, what bot do u run?
2011-05-12T17:19:24  <mcstar> python?

2011-05-12T17:30:27  <McLeopold> mcstar: yes python
2011-05-12T17:30:44  <mcstar> could you try another bot?
2011-05-12T17:31:07  <McLeopold> for testing stderr?
2011-05-12T17:31:11  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-12T17:31:29  <McLeopold> I don't think another error bot has been created
2011-05-12T17:31:42  <mcstar> let me help
2011-05-12T17:31:50  <mcstar> in dist/starter_bots/cpp/State.cc
2011-05-12T17:32:09  <mcstar> line 144
2011-05-12T17:32:14  <mcstar> cerr<<"cpplog: "<<inputType;
2011-05-12T17:32:21  <mcstar> add this line before that
2011-05-12T17:32:27  <mcstar> ok?
2011-05-12T17:32:33  <McLeopold> I'll try
2011-05-12T17:32:41  <mcstar> thanks
2011-05-12T17:32:59  <McLeopold> but if it doesn't crash, it may deadlock the buffer, or something
2011-05-12T17:33:29  <mcstar> are you saying that i can only see the output from stderr if the bot crashes?
2011-05-12T17:33:51  <McLeopold> not entirely
2011-05-12T17:34:02  <McLeopold> janzert said there was an issue with too much stderr
2011-05-12T17:34:12  <McLeopold> and right now it is only capturing it at the end
2011-05-12T17:34:39  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-12T17:34:52  <mcstar> im lost
2011-05-12T17:35:00  <mcstar> i mean are you inclined to fix this?
2011-05-12T17:35:09  <mcstar> or is this how it supposed to be
2011-05-12T17:35:12  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-12T17:36:02  <mcstar> a real time log would be very useful
2011-05-12T17:36:11  <jmcarthur> wtfd
2011-05-12T17:36:13  <jmcarthur> -d
2011-05-12T17:36:30  <mcstar> and i dont really know why did it have to be rewritten
2011-05-12T17:36:30  <jmcarthur> yay accidental pastes?
2011-05-12T17:36:35  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-12T17:36:37  <mcstar> sry
2011-05-12T17:36:59  <mcstar> did i wake you jmcarthur ?

2011-05-12T17:41:51  * teuneboon is getting frustrated XD
2011-05-12T17:42:13  <mcstar> teuneboon: why are you stuck with "end"?
2011-05-12T17:42:20  <teuneboon> I have no freaking idea
2011-05-12T17:42:31  <mcstar> i mean is it really that important?
2011-05-12T17:42:38  <teuneboon> I need to know the score :P
2011-05-12T17:42:47  <jmcarthur> mcstar: nah
2011-05-12T17:43:09  <mcstar> how about the replay file?
2011-05-12T17:43:14  <mcstar> isnt it there?
2011-05-12T17:43:38  <jmcarthur> what's the time frame on this contest? i thought things were ramping up quite a long time ago
2011-05-12T17:43:54  <teuneboon> kind of an ugly way, but the only way in nodejs I think
2011-05-12T17:43:54  <mcstar> good question
2011-05-12T17:44:08  <mcstar> has it reached beta yet?
2011-05-12T17:44:18  <jmcarthur> i mean, i realize for most of the time the answer has been "it's done when it's done," but still
2011-05-12T17:44:41  <mcstar> i simply stopped asking
2011-05-12T17:44:46  <jmcarthur> if it takes long enough maybe i can actually participate after all
2011-05-12T17:44:54  <jmcarthur> after i move a couple times :P
2011-05-12T17:44:59  <mcstar> i realized that someone asks it nevertheless
2011-05-12T17:45:49  <mcstar> what language would you use?
2011-05-12T17:45:55  <jmcarthur> haskell
2011-05-12T17:46:18  <mcstar> is there a starter?
2011-05-12T17:46:25  <jmcarthur> brb
2011-05-12T17:46:41  <McLeopold> teuneboon: good news
2011-05-12T17:46:46  <teuneboon> what what what? :P
2011-05-12T17:46:59  <McLeopold> I can get the startbot to log the end
2011-05-12T17:47:09  <teuneboon> ah, nice, how did you do it?
2011-05-12T17:47:15  <McLeopold> I added logging
2011-05-12T17:47:34  <teuneboon> ?
2011-05-12T17:47:43  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-12T17:47:54  <jmcarthur> mcstar: i had made a mostly working starter *library* some time ago, but it's very over-engineered, lacking in documentation, probably out of date now, and... well, i don't think i want to push for it to be official at all
2011-05-12T17:47:55  *** kaemo0 <kaemo0!~mad5ci@d33-29.icpnet.pl> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-05-12T17:48:08  <McLeopold> at the top of processLine, I did some syncronous file logging, at I got everything, including the end stuf
2011-05-12T17:48:35  <teuneboon> ah nice, can you put the code on github?
2011-05-12T17:49:02  <jmcarthur> mcstar: i had plans to make it better but then i started taking my job hunt more seriously, and now i'm moving, so i just don't want to work on the starter anymore
2011-05-12T17:49:10  <McLeopold> I'm not sure if I want starter bots to include logging...
2011-05-12T17:49:14  <jmcarthur> frankly i don't want my name on it :P
2011-05-12T17:49:21  <mcstar> hehe
2011-05-12T17:49:21  <teuneboon> oh ok, can you at least show me some code? :P
2011-05-12T17:49:24  <mcstar> cant be that bad
2011-05-12T17:49:25  <teuneboon> would be very grateful
2011-05-12T17:49:25  <teuneboon> XD
2011-05-12T17:49:56  <jmcarthur> mcstar: mainly i'm embarrassed by the overengineering i did
2011-05-12T17:50:07  <McLeopold> var log = fs.openSync('log.log', 'a'); fs.writeSync(log, line, null); fs.closeSync(log);
2011-05-12T17:50:18  <mcstar> does it mean its flexible and extensible?
2011-05-12T17:50:27  <jmcarthur> hehe, quite
2011-05-12T17:50:49  <teuneboon> let's see: P
2011-05-12T17:50:51  <jmcarthur> but i think those properties could be retained with something a little simpler
2011-05-12T17:50:51  <McLeopold> the bot is a long list of function names with random "." and "$" separators
2011-05-12T17:50:59  <mcstar> for some reason your name is associated with cl in my mind
2011-05-12T17:51:12  <jmcarthur> no, i don't really have any cl experience
2011-05-12T17:51:34  <jmcarthur> my most prominent online presence is all haskell stuff, probably functional reactive programming or gamedev related
2011-05-12T17:52:03  <mcstar> unfortunately my haskell is close to my spanish
2011-05-12T17:52:39  <mcstar> i should add that i dont know spanish :)
2011-05-12T17:52:44  <jmcarthur> no hable monads

2011-05-12T17:52:57  <teuneboon> McLeopold, it doesn't work here :(
2011-05-12T17:53:18  <mcstar> but definitely will try it
2011-05-12T17:53:35  <teuneboon> ah wait, forgot to add the new variable to the play game
2011-05-12T17:53:42  <mcstar> basically i found cl to be easier to get to know fro the contest that haskell
2011-05-12T17:53:46  <McLeopold> teuneboon: I'm using 0.4.7 and I used a full path for the file name
2011-05-12T17:53:50  <mcstar> but i considered it as well
2011-05-12T17:53:55  <teuneboon> the end_wait
2011-05-12T17:53:59  <teuneboon> I forgot that one
2011-05-12T17:54:02  <teuneboon> cause the log works
2011-05-12T17:54:10  <teuneboon> but it didn't log end, trying something now though
2011-05-12T17:54:15  <jmcarthur> frequently my conversations in this channel turn into some sort of haskell topic, and i bet everybody is tired of it
2011-05-12T17:54:26  <mcstar> :D
2011-05-12T17:54:27  <jmcarthur> actually i guess a lot of conversations here are about languages though
2011-05-12T17:54:32  <McLeopold> not anymore, you've gone dark
2011-05-12T17:54:36  <jmcarthur> yeah well...
2011-05-12T17:54:38  <teuneboon> yay, it logged the end!
2011-05-12T17:54:51  <mcstar> o.O
2011-05-12T17:54:56  <jmcarthur> once you go black you never go back
2011-05-12T17:54:59  <teuneboon> thanks man :P
2011-05-12T17:55:00  <mcstar> is this useful to me too?
2011-05-12T17:55:04  <McLeopold> jmcarthur, I'm going to write a simple haskell starter soon :D
2011-05-12T17:55:07  <mcstar> (dirty)
2011-05-12T17:55:11  <jmcarthur> orly?
2011-05-12T17:55:19  <McLeopold> yah
2011-05-12T17:55:22  <McLeopold> rly
2011-05-12T17:55:29  <jmcarthur> cool
2011-05-12T17:55:43  <jmcarthur> just don't base it on mine and everything will be cool
2011-05-12T17:56:01  <McLeopold> I can read haskell code now, but writing it takes a lot of creativity still

2011-05-12T18:00:17  <mcstar> is it enough if i crash, or does my bot have to crash too?

2011-05-12T18:49:41  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-05-12T18:50:23  <McLeopold> so, if you have 1 ant by itself, and it dies, you don't get to see what happened
2011-05-12T18:50:45  <McLeopold> I'm thinking vision should include the space around your dead ants, for that turn
2011-05-12T18:51:47  <jmcarthur> i agree
2011-05-12T18:52:21  <McLeopold> or we can say, the vision/scouting info was passed back before the battle occured
2011-05-12T18:52:34  <McLeopold> so people don't ask why dead ants can see
2011-05-12T18:53:16  <jmcarthur> you could make it consistent by taking the union of visibility before and after all moves and fights and using that to determine what the bot can see as a result of the turn
2011-05-12T18:53:56  <jmcarthur> that would mean that dead ants get to see the area they could see before they died, and ants that move have kind of a smearing vision i guess
2011-05-12T19:14:46  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I think just defining it as what you can see after moves and before attacks is good enough
2011-05-12T19:15:48  <jmcarthur> well, that's my two cents

2011-05-12T20:02:09  <CIA-48> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r62d4485 / worker/sandbox.py : removed old monitor function - http://bit.ly/mO0KAc
2011-05-12T20:02:19  <McLeopold> janzert: you may want to review my changes
2011-05-12T20:02:26  <McLeopold> or amstan
2011-05-12T20:03:01  <McLeopold> The big difference is that sandbox.kill does not get called from the monitor function anymore, but it doesn't seem to affect anything
2011-05-12T20:06:24  <janzert> I'd really really rather that bare except clause printed the exception info to stderr so it didn't just get swallowed and somewhat prefer that the exception still killed the sandbox, it just seems like a nice safety measure
2011-05-12T20:07:28  <janzert> actually if the sandbox.kill call isn't put back into that except clause, just get rid of it alltogether and the default handler will print to stderr
2011-05-12T20:10:47  <McLeopold> I don't want stderr going directly to stderr
2011-05-12T20:11:06  <McLeopold> I'm capturing both stdout and stderr from bots and processing it in different ways
2011-05-12T20:11:52  <McLeopold> oh, that error...
2011-05-12T20:11:55  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-12T20:13:46  <McLeopold> janzert: that would be considered errors produced by the bot, even though it came from sandbox, no?
2011-05-12T20:14:54  <McLeopold> janzert: and with stdout not being monitored, the bot should get cleaned up with a crash or timeout status
2011-05-12T20:16:37  <CIA-48> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * ra996b12 / worker/sandbox.py : removed error trapping of monitor, ignoring signal error - http://bit.ly/m8EPey
2011-05-12T20:21:03  <janzert> basically that should never throw except on some sort of OSError, mostly I'm just being paranoid that a bot could somehow induce an error here and escalate it to breaking out of the sandbox
2011-05-12T20:21:23  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-12T20:21:33  <janzert> which is why I'd prefer that it killed the sandbox, but at the same time I can't think of any actual way to exploit it
2011-05-12T20:21:44  <janzert> but that just means I can't think of one of course :)
2011-05-12T20:21:49  <McLeopold> :)
2011-05-12T20:21:54  <McLeopold> must be secure!
2011-05-12T20:22:15  <McLeopold> well, removing kill wasn't the goal, just a side affect
2011-05-12T20:22:21  <janzert> yeah
2011-05-12T20:22:33  <McLeopold> so, if you can improve it, the great
2011-05-12T20:22:39  <janzert> since it doesn't have the reference to the sandbox anymore
2011-05-12T20:22:52  <McLeopold> yeah, I didn't want to think about it :)
2011-05-12T20:23:09  <McLeopold> I guess we just pass that back in, who cares if it looks crappy
2011-05-12T20:23:47  <janzert> btw, at some point it would be nice for the engine to take advantage of the read_line timeout so it doesn't have to spin waiting for bot response
2011-05-12T20:24:05  <janzert> would reduce its cpu usage

2011-05-12T20:24:24  <janzert> also something else to think about but I'm not sure if it is worth it
2011-05-12T20:24:27  <McLeopold>  I thought the "read up to 100 lines" was going to help with that
2011-05-12T20:24:42  <McLeopold> coupled with the sleep above
2011-05-12T20:25:12  <janzert> is to have the monitor timestamp each incoming line and the engine then use that to check for the timeout
2011-05-12T20:25:19  <janzert> it would be slightly more accurate
2011-05-12T20:25:34  <McLeopold> can you create an issue on that?

2011-05-12T22:39:28  <Frontier> "replaydata.ants.0.6.length should be within [3 .. 4], but was found to be 2!" means that the ant was alive for 3 turns (+1 if it was the end of the game) but it only two orders (in this replay: 2x 'do nothing') were issued, which is wrong. There should be three orders.

It may have to do with a bot that didn't quit properly, but I only found that in the channel logs.
