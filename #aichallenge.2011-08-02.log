2011-08-02T16:17:40  <janzert> I thought java needed an extra classpath argument? but maybe I'm remembering wrong
2011-08-02T16:18:31  <janzert> if it that java command line actually works when executed directly then I think it should work for playgame as well
2011-08-02T16:18:41  <detryo> then it would be a compiling problem (but it might be swallowed by the python script)

2011-08-02T16:26:46  <janzert> yep, but if you can execute it manually with the same command line you are giving playgame.py (from the same directory/environment) then theoretically playgame.py should run it fine too

2011-08-02T16:36:06  <berak> detryo, note, that in the actual contest, you're supposed to submit a 'jar' file containing all of the class files you're using. if you do the same in your etsting/playgame situation, you can alt least rule out the situation, that the entry point is found correctly, but not other, dependant classes
2011-08-02T16:41:52  <janzert> berak: no, you submit the .java source files and it is compiled by the server
2011-08-02T16:42:22  <berak> sorry  ;(

2011-08-02T16:45:18  <detryo> wb, anyway, I tried with the .jar and nothing
2011-08-02T16:45:29  <detryo> I'm now debugging playgame.py
2011-08-02T16:46:54  <mathis_> I'm using "java -cp your/path MyBot" in the .cmd file on windows, have you tried that?

2011-08-02T16:54:21  <detryo> my classpath is well configured, never the less I will try, thank you for the hint
2011-08-02T16:54:43  <detryo> what I see debugging playgame is that  it does not start the bots
2011-08-02T16:56:25  <detryo> sandbox has two is_alive one is true and the other one false
2011-08-02T16:56:55  <detryo> one actually setted in the .start itself
2011-08-02T17:04:56  <detryo> ok, when executing java /blah/MyBot it outputs an error since blah.MyBot does not exists
2011-08-02T17:07:26  <detryo> now it outputs a timeout
2011-08-02T17:07:26  <detryo> when using my bot
2011-08-02T17:07:31  <detryo> thank you for  help !

2011-08-02T19:02:12  <irsl> hi, is there any way to debug my java bot?
2011-08-02T19:02:21  <irsl> executing it from python I mean
2011-08-02T19:02:48  <irsl> I added the -Xdebug -X... to the command line execution but it is not working
2011-08-02T19:02:54  <irsl> or is there a java engine?
2011-08-02T19:20:00  <irsl> doing it
2011-08-02T19:20:23  <irsl> but the  python timer does not stop
2011-08-02T19:20:27  <irsl> see you all!
