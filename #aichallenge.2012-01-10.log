2012-01-10T06:50:57  <antimatroid> it's pretty easy to get running actually
2012-01-10T06:52:18  <mcstar> i havent run in months
2012-01-10T06:52:28  <mcstar> winter is a downtime for me
2012-01-10T06:52:38  <antimatroid> :P
2012-01-10T06:52:52  <antimatroid> i rode my bike to uni today, wasn't as easy as at the end of last year
2012-01-10T06:52:54  <antimatroid> too lazy lately
2012-01-10T06:57:50  <mcstar> i bet you read some haskell, thats why
2012-01-10T06:58:14  <pairofdice> Hasmilk
2012-01-10T06:58:21  <mcstar> i measured my weight last week, im 93 kgs!
2012-01-10T06:58:30  <mcstar> i couldnt believe the scale
2012-01-10T06:58:44  <mcstar> i wonder where that weight is
2012-01-10T07:01:47  <mcstar> anyway, ive got to find a way to motivate myself to do regular exercises
2012-01-10T07:02:01  <pairofdice> That is the question
2012-01-10T07:02:39  <mcstar> pairofdice: do you exercise?
2012-01-10T07:04:24  <mcstar> soft spot?
2012-01-10T07:05:03  <pairofdice> Once in a while
2012-01-10T07:06:03  <pairofdice> I weight less than 70 so no great issues there
2012-01-10T07:06:06  <pairofdice> kg
2012-01-10T07:06:37  <mcstar> im not overweight either, i really wonder where that weight is
2012-01-10T07:06:44  <pairofdice> Ask Higgs
2012-01-10T07:06:52  <mcstar> hm
2012-01-10T07:06:58  <mcstar> funny
2012-01-10T07:07:00  <mcstar> really
2012-01-10T07:07:19  <mcstar> anyway, my ankles feel it nevertheless
2012-01-10T07:07:32  <mcstar> but i still found running the most motivating exercise so far
2012-01-10T07:07:40  <mcstar> i incredibly hate weigth lifting
2012-01-10T07:07:55  <mcstar> i find cycling boring
2012-01-10T07:08:09  <mcstar> but running is great
2012-01-10T07:08:21  <Jak_o_Shadows> Cyclings not boring if you're going somewhere, but cycling on a stand is boring.
2012-01-10T07:08:53  <mcstar> not on a stand
2012-01-10T07:09:01  <mcstar> but im considerng buying one
2012-01-10T07:09:02  <pairofdice> Cycling in the winter is anything but boring
2012-01-10T07:09:11  <mcstar> isnt it great, you can watch something, and still peadl?
2012-01-10T07:09:48  <antimatroid> riding is fun when you have cool shit to look at
2012-01-10T07:09:52  <mcstar> it takes too  much time to tire me down...
2012-01-10T07:09:59  <antimatroid> like 5km each way to uni is on a bike path next to the water
2012-01-10T07:10:07  <antimatroid> ride harder
2012-01-10T07:10:16  <antimatroid> go tackle a mountain
2012-01-10T07:10:28  <antimatroid> best thing is, what goes up must come down, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2012-01-10T07:10:30  <mcstar> hills kill me
2012-01-10T07:10:32  <Jak_o_Shadows> Problem with my stand, is that I can't watch anything on TV either, it's too loud
2012-01-10T07:10:47  <mcstar> Jak_o_Shadows: is it old?
2012-01-10T07:10:51  <antimatroid> hills kill me too
2012-01-10T07:10:56  <antimatroid> but i'm slowly getting better at them
2012-01-10T07:12:21  <Jak_o_Shadows> mcstar: Not old, it uses a fan thing for resistance, and the bike is old. If i tightened it up properly it might be quieter, but still really loud.
2012-01-10T07:12:43  <pairofdice> Noise cancelling headphones? :)
2012-01-10T07:12:51  <mcstar> or simply headphones
2012-01-10T07:12:58  <mcstar> or earbud
2012-01-10T07:13:02  <pairofdice> Probably not enough
2012-01-10T07:13:11  <mcstar> i guess he tried
2012-01-10T07:13:42  <Jak_o_Shadows> Nowhere near enough. I should try to figure out how to make it have more resistance.
2012-01-10T07:14:09  <mcstar> afaik today's bikes use magnetic resistance
2012-01-10T07:14:21  <mcstar> i think thats totally noiseless
2012-01-10T07:14:45  <mcstar> whats the proper name of this stand-bike?
2012-01-10T07:15:09  <mcstar> we call it room-bicycle, but that wont work in english
2012-01-10T07:15:38  <Jak_o_Shadows> Yeah, that would be nice. Name = really cheap triangle one that you clamp a normal bike into. I once tried hooking it up to a drill motor, that sort of worked.
2012-01-10T07:16:02  <mcstar> hah
2012-01-10T07:17:08  <mcstar> they seem to call what i meant stationary bicycles
2012-01-10T07:17:42  <Jak_o_Shadows> Yeah, a proper exercise bike is much nicer, but i'm not serious enough for that.
2012-01-10T07:18:42  <mcstar> i guess a good one that wont break in a week is not that cheap, so id use it if i bought it
2012-01-10T07:21:15  <Jak_o_Shadows> Oh yeah, I should definitely use mine more. It's just that i'm not that fit, I get bored easily while staring at nothing, and mosquitos come out by the time it's cooled down enough outside to use it.

2012-01-10T14:14:08  <a1k0n> haha.  that's not pencil and paper, that's cheating with haskell
2012-01-10T14:14:41  <mcstar> XD
2012-01-10T14:16:28  <thestinger> mcstar: you can even cut a few characters off that :P
2012-01-10T14:17:17  <mcstar> product?
2012-01-10T14:17:27  <thestinger> and use map instead of the first list comprehension
2012-01-10T14:17:28  <mcstar> ill get used to it
2012-01-10T14:18:29  <mcstar> thestinger: you want to keep all those damn list comprehensions to yourself right?
2012-01-10T14:18:48  <thestinger> they're an unsustainable resource
2012-01-10T14:19:22  <thestinger> map is faster in ghci anyway :)
2012-01-10T14:20:10  <thestinger> anyway I really wish tuple unpacking in python was lazy with generators
2012-01-10T14:20:19  <mcstar> the motivation behind the concant and the comprehension is that i dont "feel" the lazyness yet
2012-01-10T14:20:39  <mcstar> sort of weird for me with map
2012-01-10T14:20:48  <mcstar> i map on something concrete
2012-01-10T14:20:49  <thestinger> map is lazy in python3 :)
2012-01-10T14:20:54  <mcstar> not on something lazy
2012-01-10T14:21:07  <mcstar> here too, i just use map a lot in cl
2012-01-10T14:21:19  <thestinger> well, everything is lazy in haskell
2012-01-10T14:21:23  <mcstar> and i have to ge tused to the concept that its lazy here
2012-01-10T14:21:27  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-10T14:21:32  <thestinger> coding with generators/iterators in python gets annoying
2012-01-10T14:21:34  <mcstar> even `se`
2012-01-10T14:21:37  <mcstar> even `seq`

2012-01-10T14:32:53  <thestinger> can just use the multiplicity of each prime factor
2012-01-10T14:33:15  <thestinger> that explains why this was too slow

2012-01-10T14:33:55  <mcstar> that was needed in some early problem
2012-01-10T14:34:09  <thestinger> I managed without it :P
2012-01-10T14:34:27  <thestinger> well, I can get prime factors really fast
2012-01-10T14:34:45  <thestinger> but getting divisors from that was too slow :)
2012-01-10T14:35:51  <a1k0n> which one are you doing?
2012-01-10T14:37:22  <thestinger> not sure, but I was stuck on a few due to this being too slow

2012-01-10T14:37:55  <thestinger> no, getting divisors from the prime factors

2012-01-10T14:47:51  <thestinger> just a line of lazily coded python

2012-01-10T14:52:26  <mcstar> count()?
2012-01-10T14:52:35  <thestinger> like range, without an end
2012-01-10T14:52:40  <mcstar> ah
2012-01-10T14:52:44  <thestinger> count(start), count(start, stop)
2012-01-10T14:52:47  <thestinger> I mean
2012-01-10T14:52:51  <thestinger> count(start, step)
2012-01-10T14:53:17  <thestinger> so an infinite list basically (infinite generator)
2012-01-10T14:53:21  <thestinger> next() is like head
2012-01-10T14:55:19  <thestinger> mcstar: all of the nice lazy generator stuff is hidden away in the itertools module in python
2012-01-10T14:55:32  <thestinger> well, other than zip, enumerate, filter, map, reduce
2012-01-10T14:55:54  <mcstar> remember what did i tell you some time ago about python?
2012-01-10T14:56:01  <thestinger> :)
2012-01-10T15:01:57  <thestinger> yay, new divisors function works
2012-01-10T15:02:37  <thestinger> wait nvm it doesn't.
2012-01-10T15:09:51  <thestinger> there.
2012-01-10T15:10:21  <cyphase> i like the gcd algorithm i use. it's simple and fast
2012-01-10T15:13:18  <mcstar> is it shiny too?
2012-01-10T15:13:22  <mcstar> mine is shiny
2012-01-10T15:13:35  <cyphase> you can't even look at mine without protective goggles
2012-01-10T15:13:50  <mcstar> :)
2012-01-10T15:13:55  <thestinger> meh... it looks like this new factoring is as slow as the old way
2012-01-10T15:14:07  <thestinger> really poorly optimized though
2012-01-10T15:14:09  <mcstar> thestinger: your bottleneck is the i7
2012-01-10T15:14:25  <thestinger> I guess I could just be bottlenecked by memory bandwidth :)
2012-01-10T15:15:01  <thestinger> trial division (up to sqrt(n)) is the same speed as using a powerset of the prime factors, which is also the same speed as doing it properly with powers
2012-01-10T15:15:04  <thestinger> :(
2012-01-10T15:16:20  <mcstar> thestinger: i guess your are not multi-threadin in any way right?
2012-01-10T15:16:24  <cyphase> thestinger, also xrange
2012-01-10T15:16:32  <thestinger> cyphase: there is no xrange in python anymore
2012-01-10T15:16:42  <cyphase> thestinger, ah, yea, python 3
2012-01-10T15:16:47  <thestinger> if you're using python2 then none of the built-ins are lazy generators
2012-01-10T15:16:57  <thestinger> you have to use imap, izip, ireduce, ifilter from itertools too
2012-01-10T15:17:00  <thestinger> in addition to xrange
2012-01-10T15:17:32  <mcstar> (75,8118264)
2012-01-10T15:17:47  <thestinger> cyphase: anyway it drives me crazy when I use pypy :)
2012-01-10T15:18:10  <cyphase> thestinger, what does?
2012-01-10T15:18:28  <thestinger> that the built-ins return lists instead of generators
2012-01-10T15:18:32  <cyphase> ah

2012-01-10T15:21:04  <mcstar> or only an algorithmic solution
2012-01-10T15:22:15  <thestinger> mcstar: I solved it just by adding code to my n_partitions function to check with each iteration (since it builds up from the previous n)
2012-01-10T15:22:31  <thestinger> but a1k0n found a nice math formula with pentagonal numbers
2012-01-10T15:22:32  <mcstar> ok, so no math
2012-01-10T15:22:59  <thestinger> mine takes 2.5s now when checking up to 100k, which is enough

2012-01-10T15:23:21  <mcstar> thats where i am

2012-01-10T15:23:30  <mcstar> :)
2012-01-10T15:23:36  <thestinger> it's over 10k for sure :)
2012-01-10T15:23:39  <thestinger> n
2012-01-10T15:23:46  <mcstar> gonna take some time then
2012-01-10T15:24:03  <mcstar> 81 now
2012-01-10T15:24:05  <thestinger> lol
2012-01-10T15:24:09  <thestinger> well, it's also over 20k and 30k
2012-01-10T15:24:27  <thestinger> mcstar: are you using a recursive solution?
2012-01-10T15:24:31  <thestinger> to find p(n)
2012-01-10T15:24:32  <mcstar> yep
2012-01-10T15:24:33  <thestinger> ah
2012-01-10T15:24:37  <mcstar> my usual function
2012-01-10T15:24:40  <thestinger> yeah, I started with that in python but it was way too slow
2012-01-10T15:24:45  <mcstar> ill code something better up
2012-01-10T15:24:56  <mcstar> but i wanted to think about a math formula ffirst
2012-01-10T15:25:02  <thestinger> so I ended up turning it into 2 nested loops with an array to store the old answers
2012-01-10T15:25:07  <thestinger> basically
2012-01-10T15:25:16  <thestinger> then I did something really weird to optimize it and it barely makes sense
2012-01-10T15:25:22  <thestinger> that was like a year ago though...
2012-01-10T15:25:38  <thestinger> ./solution  171.83s user 0.09s system 99% cpu 2:51.99 total

2012-01-10T15:25:40  <thestinger> meh
2012-01-10T15:25:53  <thestinger> it takes almost 3 minutes to find the divisors for all numbers below 10**7
2012-01-10T15:26:05  <thestinger> now to benchmark the old functions...

2012-01-10T15:57:30  <thestinger> that's what a1k0n used
2012-01-10T15:57:34  <thestinger> the one with pentagonal numbers, right?
2012-01-10T15:57:36  <mcstar> thats what i will
2012-01-10T15:57:38  <thestinger> a q series or whatever
2012-01-10T15:57:39  <mcstar> no
2012-01-10T15:57:41  <mcstar> no
2012-01-10T15:57:56  <mcstar> at least those 2 things didnt come up so far
2012-01-10T15:58:03  <mcstar> so i dont think they are related
2012-01-10T15:58:17  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)#Generating_function this, right?
2012-01-10T15:58:29  <thestinger> The denominator of the product is Euler's function and can be written, by the pentagonal number theorem, as
2012-01-10T15:58:30  <mcstar> im reading some lecture notes
2012-01-10T15:59:15  <a1k0n> the generating function might expand out as pentagonal numbers
2012-01-10T15:59:25  <a1k0n> i didn't do the algebra myself
2012-01-10T16:00:06  <a1k0n> i need to clear out p50
2012-01-10T16:00:21  <mcstar> i never heaRD of pentagonal numbers before
2012-01-10T16:00:29  <a1k0n> me either
2012-01-10T16:00:35  <thestinger> you probably have
2012-01-10T16:00:48  <thestinger> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/First_six_triangular_numbers.svg
2012-01-10T16:00:55  <mcstar> well, here i came across triangular, hexagonal and some other
2012-01-10T16:01:14  <mcstar> haha
2012-01-10T16:01:30  <a1k0n> it's also odd that they're generated by 0, +1, -1, +2, -2, +3, ...  i've never seen a sequence like that
2012-01-10T16:01:41  <a1k0n> without involving complex numbers anyway
2012-01-10T16:03:10  <thestinger> n * (3 * n - 1) // 2 is what I used for some euler question about them
2012-01-10T16:03:54  <mcstar> so these -gonal numbers are the number of little balls you need to have for any proper n-gon
2012-01-10T16:04:10  <thestinger> there was one where you had to find a number which is a triangle number, a hexagonal number and a pentagonal number
2012-01-10T16:04:12  <mcstar> makes sense, but i havent given any thought to them before
2012-01-10T16:05:04  <thestinger> you can also just solve that equation and write a test to see if a number is pentagonal
2012-01-10T16:05:09  <thestinger> don't need it for this though
2012-01-10T16:05:16  <mcstar> thestinger: now tis makes it trivial that every hexagonal number is triagonal too
2012-01-10T16:05:23  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-10T16:05:24  <mcstar> (i used a substitution to prove it)
2012-01-10T16:05:55  <thestinger> have you done 45?
2012-01-10T16:06:02  <thestinger> that's the one with all 3

2012-01-10T16:29:19  <a1k0n> just as i solved p50
2012-01-10T16:29:46  <mleise> hehe, i hope everything is lost and they have no backup.
2012-01-10T16:30:02  <a1k0n> guess i should do some work
2012-01-10T16:30:07  <jcdjcd> I am pretty sure correlation implies causation in this case.
2012-01-10T16:30:07  <mleise> because I still have my code for everything and you don't , ha har
2012-01-10T16:30:18  <a1k0n> i still have most of my code

2012-01-10T16:30:44  <mleise> Oh nooooo!
2012-01-10T16:31:08  <mleise> next reboot I'll backup, I promise
2012-01-10T16:31:29  <mcstar> talk about the devil...
2012-01-10T16:31:37  <a1k0n> all my stuff is in the cloud now, devices are transient
2012-01-10T16:31:57  <mcstar> i have too much stuff, i dont want to break the cloud
2012-01-10T16:32:01  <a1k0n> except raw photos i guess
2012-01-10T16:32:27  <mcstar> i have 2TB stuff, noway the cloud can handle that
2012-01-10T16:32:41  <mleise> I don't know... all that private stuff on someone elses server?
2012-01-10T16:32:51  <jcdjcd> I am pretty sure the porn is already in the cloud
2012-01-10T16:33:08  <mleise> oh do they scan for duplicates?
2012-01-10T16:33:20  <jcdjcd> they do.
2012-01-10T16:33:32  <thestinger> that's what sshfs is for
2012-01-10T16:33:33  <mleise> that would speed up the upload if they calculated the checksum on the client
2012-01-10T16:33:39  <mcstar> i film my own pron...
2012-01-10T16:33:40  <a1k0n> indeed
2012-01-10T16:34:05  <thestinger> aw crap, I wasted 10 minutes optimizing this and it does _more_ memory allocations than before
2012-01-10T16:34:06  <a1k0n> i uploaded all my music to teh google also
2012-01-10T16:34:26  <mleise> thestinger: memory allocations *are bad*
2012-01-10T16:34:29  <thestinger> and now I have code like this:
2012-01-10T16:34:32  <thestinger>         v.resize(old_size + old_size * powers.size());
2012-01-10T16:34:36  <thestinger> and then
2012-01-10T16:34:38  <thestinger>                 v[old_size + i * powers.size() + j] = (v[i] * powers[j]);

2012-01-10T16:35:14  <thestinger> they use pygments which is nice, but they really need to stick the line numbers in a div
2012-01-10T16:35:14  <mcstar> ah
2012-01-10T16:35:23  <mcstar> they need to put that into the background
2012-01-10T16:35:38  <thestinger> well if they put it in a div it wouldn't be selected with the code

2012-01-10T16:44:51  <mleise> but really, 2% is pretty common for little optimizations that depend on more than is visible
2012-01-10T16:45:38  <mleise> code fits in cache? compiler knows better? CPU is particularly bad with that setup (predictions, ...)
2012-01-10T16:46:37  <mleise> for example going through a large array in sequence is orders of magnitude faster than random access

2012-01-10T16:53:13  <mleise> I have a nice idea for "n choose k" and other Pascal's triangle operations. I'll make a Pascal's triangle struct, that I can "move around" in. Most tasks don't require random access, but rather some sort of iteration, i.e. 1 row up, 2 to the left
2012-01-10T16:54:53  <thestinger> mleise: you can do it iteratively instead of with the recursive or factorial equation

2012-01-10T16:55:27  <thestinger> or you can make it tail-recursive the same way
2012-01-10T16:57:09  <mleise> I have an iterative function already. The point is to just have a struct that represents a location in the triangle and offers methods to move around from there (using the right iterative function for row or diagonal moves)
2012-01-10T16:57:27  <thestinger> ah
2012-01-10T16:57:53  <thestinger> haskell is nice for stuff like that due to laziness
2012-01-10T16:59:09  <mleise> I wouldn't know how lazyness can help here. pascal.moveLeft(2); pascal.moveRightUp(1); are two iterator function on one struct
2012-01-10T16:59:22  <thestinger> well you wouldn't need to populate the whole struct
2012-01-10T16:59:29  <thestinger> you could have an infinitely large tree
2012-01-10T16:59:54  <mleise> hehe, I don't do that. I hope to have no more than "ℕ n, k, value;"
2012-01-10T17:00:12  <mleise> so it is only a few bytes in size
2012-01-10T17:00:34  <thestinger> or you can be like McLeopold and precalculate a 2GB one :)
2012-01-10T17:00:57  <mleise> he isn't doing himself a favor with that I believe ^^
2012-01-10T17:02:09  <mleise> then again, if you only seek to the right byte offset it could be fast... hmm. nah. that's cheating and I need my disk for other stuff.
2012-01-10T17:03:03  <mcstar> perfect for a haskell zipper
2012-01-10T17:03:11  <mcstar> but otherwise its pointless

2012-01-10T17:14:38  <thestinger> trial division takes 8s, but ofc it gets much worse with higher numbers
2012-01-10T17:18:29  <thestinger> anyway there's a way to do it with a map of {prime_factor: multiplicity} and it should be faster, but it's slower than my crappy powerset method

2012-01-10T17:59:33  <a1k0n> i compute the largest consecutive prime below the target number, starting from each prime in turn
2012-01-10T17:59:37  <a1k0n> it's pretty easy
2012-01-10T17:59:56  <thestinger> a1k0n: http://sprunge.us/eVHD that was my silly code
2012-01-10T18:00:04  <thestinger> originally it was in python with a slice so it's kind of weird
2012-01-10T18:00:24  <a1k0n> i thought about using a binary search to do the prime test but i didn't even bother
2012-01-10T18:00:26  <thestinger> candidates is a deque with all the primes up to the target
2012-01-10T18:00:49  <thestinger> a1k0n: well, it's actually less characters to type than std::find :)
2012-01-10T18:01:00  <a1k0n> i just recompute is_prime as necessary
2012-01-10T18:01:06  <thestinger> ah
2012-01-10T18:01:16  <thestinger> I use a sieve to get primes up to the target
2012-01-10T18:01:24  <a1k0n> i do too
2012-01-10T18:01:30  <a1k0n> but i don't save the large primes
2012-01-10T18:01:36  <thestinger> ah
2012-01-10T18:01:56  <a1k0n> e.g. composites < 1000000 will have prime factors < 1000
2012-01-10T18:02:02  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-10T18:02:14  <thestinger> so your is_prime uses primes up to sqrt(n)+1?

2012-01-10T18:07:36  <thestinger> takes 20s to brute force (checking the n_divisors for each number up to 10**7)

2012-01-10T18:13:02  <mcstar> apparently it isnt
2012-01-10T18:13:35  <mcstar> i use an x:xs pattern on [1..]
2012-01-10T18:13:38  <mcstar> but thats ok
2012-01-10T18:14:09  <thestinger> not if it's recursive
2012-01-10T18:15:43  <mcstar> thestinger: explain
2012-01-10T18:16:37  <thestinger> well if it's recursive you're probably passing a smaller list to it each time
2012-01-10T18:16:46  <thestinger> so eventually it gets down to [] and there's no match
2012-01-10T18:16:54  <mcstar> thats impossible
2012-01-10T18:17:01  <mcstar> [1..] cant shrinnk to []
2012-01-10T18:17:18  <thestinger> true :P
2012-01-10T18:17:30  <thestinger> is that actually an error or just a warning?

2012-01-10T18:27:09  <amstan> lol
2012-01-10T18:27:18  <amstan> now i just need to fix that services thing
2012-01-10T18:27:26  <mcstar> thestinger: i wrote my solution to 78 with eulers p(n) still effing slow
2012-01-10T18:27:35  <mcstar> how much time did yours need?
2012-01-10T18:27:56  <thestinger> 2.5s to compute up to 100k
2012-01-10T18:28:01  <thestinger> I didn't use a nice math solution
2012-01-10T18:28:09  <thestinger> so I had to guess at the upper bound
2012-01-10T18:28:34  <mcstar>  eulerp olds n = (sum $ zipWith (*) sumdivsList olds) `div`
2012-01-10T18:28:36  <thestinger> I end up with p(n) for each 1..n with one function call to n_partitions
2012-01-10T18:28:38  <mcstar> thats how i do it
2012-01-10T18:28:53  <thestinger> so I added in a line to check with each iteration
2012-01-10T18:29:11  <mcstar> eulerp olds n = (sum $ zipWith (*) sumdivsList olds) `div` n
2012-01-10T18:29:49  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/Thgf that's what I used for 31, 76 and 78 (but with an extra check with each iteration for 78)
2012-01-10T18:30:01  <thestinger> a1k0n found a better way to do it
2012-01-10T18:30:14  <mcstar> im not gonna chek it
2012-01-10T18:30:21  <mcstar> ill find a better way too
2012-01-10T18:30:25  <mcstar> :D
2012-01-10T18:30:32  <thestinger> well, he cheated and looked it up :)
2012-01-10T18:30:36  <a1k0n> haha
2012-01-10T18:30:39  <mleise> #78 was nice :D
2012-01-10T18:30:44  <thestinger> http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html
2012-01-10T18:30:44  <mcstar> well, i looked it up too
2012-01-10T18:30:55  <mcstar> noway i could come up with eulers generator function
2012-01-10T18:31:17  <thestinger> I'll be back in about an hour
2012-01-10T18:31:21  <mleise> looks so harmless and then ... bang ... an advanced generator function
2012-01-10T18:31:30  <a1k0n> oh, recurrence 11 looks easier
2012-01-10T18:31:54  <a1k0n> er, duh, that's the same thing

2012-01-10T18:34:06  <a1k0n> haha equation 20 and equation 11 are identical on that mathworld link
2012-01-10T18:34:31  <mleise> mcstar: the problem with eulers generator function is, that terms are added as you progress (or are defined as 0 while your n is too small)
2012-01-10T18:34:55  <mcstar> the problem with it is that looks like an inner product
2012-01-10T18:35:12  <mcstar> and traverses 2 lists to compute the next values
2012-01-10T18:35:16  <mcstar> -s
2012-01-10T18:35:23  <a1k0n> eh?
2012-01-10T18:35:26  <mcstar> and i see now, that theres recurrence relations
2012-01-10T18:35:32  <mcstar> so with them its easier
2012-01-10T18:35:46  <mleise> You can't deduce that from looking at the numbers alone... or it is hard at least and I spent hours finding some logic by adding and subtracting or dividing values, just to find that a few iteration further it doesn't work any more.
2012-01-10T18:35:46  <mcstar> a1k0n: eulerp olds n = (sum $ zipWith (*) sumdivsList olds) `div` n
2012-01-10T18:35:47  <a1k0n> yeah, but the beauty of it is you visit a sparse set of previously-computed values for each new value
2012-01-10T18:35:59  <a1k0n> so it runs very quickly
2012-01-10T18:36:03  <mcstar> ^^ thats a dense one
2012-01-10T18:36:10  <mcstar> EVREY element must be visited
2012-01-10T18:36:24  <a1k0n> yeah, that method is way too slow
2012-01-10T18:36:54  <a1k0n> i first implemented a dynamic programming version which required 6 gigs of RAM to solve it
2012-01-10T18:37:13  <mcstar> id need a vector for this though, and i cant do vectors in haskell :(
2012-01-10T18:37:14  <a1k0n> then i did the brute force method and it basically choked at around 30k
2012-01-10T18:37:18  <mleise> it can be solved in 40 ms
2012-01-10T18:37:28  <a1k0n> yeah my final solution takes ~150ms
2012-01-10T18:38:16  <mleise> in the end it all comes down to the algorithm complexity. some languages may be 5 times slower, but you really feel it when your algorithm sucks
2012-01-10T18:39:01  <mleise> some solutions I brute force and then take a look in the forum to optimize my code.
2012-01-10T18:39:21  <mcstar> the forum is full of bs
2012-01-10T18:39:25  <a1k0n> and *i'm* the one who cheats?
2012-01-10T18:39:36  <mleise> :(
2012-01-10T18:39:52  <a1k0n> the first post on the forum is inevitably some russian dude posting his assembly solution
2012-01-10T18:39:54  <mcstar> mleise: there are some gems, but the majority...
2012-01-10T18:40:03  <mcstar> haha
2012-01-10T18:40:22  <mcstar> they just hacked the timestamp
2012-01-10T18:40:40  <a1k0n> no i think they teach number theory in grade school there
2012-01-10T18:40:41  <mleise> it is not like his solution is the fastest either
2012-01-10T18:41:04  <mleise> 110 ms ASM vs. 35ms C is common on the forum
2012-01-10T18:41:20  <mcstar> i know that id never check an asm solution
2012-01-10T18:41:46  <mleise> mcstar: The rectangular triangle problem... I found some nice idea on the forum
2012-01-10T18:41:55  <mcstar> XD
2012-01-10T18:42:02  <mcstar> try drawing one
2012-01-10T18:42:07  <mcstar> rectangular triangle
2012-01-10T18:42:14  <mleise> uh... how do you say it in english?
2012-01-10T18:42:22  <mleise> right angled?
2012-01-10T18:42:28  <mcstar> yep
2012-01-10T18:42:31  <mcstar> 90deg
2012-01-10T18:42:45  <a1k0n> right triangle then
2012-01-10T18:43:09  <mcstar> right as in |good|
2012-01-10T18:43:13  <mcstar> damn
2012-01-10T18:43:14  <mleise> anyway, dividing the search space by 2 sped it up quite a bit. but I don't believe the claim of 0.1 s
2012-01-10T18:43:22  <mcstar> i changed my layout to us...

2012-01-10T18:43:57  <Zannick> hello!

2012-01-10T18:44:21  <mleise> are you role-playing?
2012-01-10T18:44:26  <Zannick> oooh, an aichallenge cloak?
2012-01-10T18:44:40  <amstan> Zannick: yeah
2012-01-10T18:44:41  <a1k0n> does it confer magic-resistance?
2012-01-10T18:44:44  <Zannick> amstan: sure :D
2012-01-10T18:44:52  <Zannick> much more snazzy than my unaffiliated cloak
2012-01-10T18:45:28  <a1k0n> blessed corrosionproof greased +3 opera cloak named aichallenge.org
2012-01-10T18:45:34  <mleise> yeah once you join a faction you get the good stuff
