2010-12-06T05:07:34  <BioMech> Hello everyone...
2010-12-06T05:08:28  <BioMech> Does anyone know what the best "Python Based" AI is???!!!???
2010-12-06T05:09:09  <Naktibalda> http://www.ai-contest.com/language_profile.php?lang=python
2010-12-06T05:09:47  <BioMech> Oh thanks for the link! =) I'm simply trying to learn more about python based AI's and advance computer thinking networks.
2010-12-06T05:10:15  * Naktibalda googles
2010-12-06T05:10:37  <sigh> BioMech: btw, dmj111 has made his code avaiable, look in the forums
2010-12-06T05:10:38  * Naktibalda fails
2010-12-06T05:10:47  <sigh> you fail at google?
2010-12-06T05:10:49  <Naktibalda> what is a computer thinking network ?
2010-12-06T05:11:52  <sigh> dunno
2010-12-06T05:12:01  <BioMech> Oh thanks for the info, well the "Computer thinking network" I'm refuring to is anything like a synthetic neural network
2010-12-06T05:12:30  <sigh> ah, I don't think any of the bots near the top used anything like that
2010-12-06T05:12:48  <BioMech> I'm trying to see what python based ai are out there and I'm looking to learn from there source code...
2010-12-06T05:13:01  *** Zoo <Zoo!lestat@ihq.in> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-06T05:13:11  <sigh> for example, dmj111's bot is a lot of heuristics specific to this game
2010-12-06T05:13:37  <sigh> it's not the best example if you want to study AI for general problems
2010-12-06T05:13:56  <BioMech> Oh lol well thanks, I'll continue searching then. I've been reading that python would be one of the ideal languages for this type of AI development. So that's why I'm searching. :)
2010-12-06T05:15:49  <Naktibalda> Lisp is the best :)
2010-12-06T05:17:40  <sigh> ah yes... I forgot that Lisp is the only language for AI :P
2010-12-06T05:17:44  <BioMech> Why LISP over Python if you don't mind me asking?
2010-12-06T05:18:01  <Naktibalda> because it's an AI #1
2010-12-06T05:18:11  <Naktibalda> it was proven in this contest :)
2010-12-06T05:18:11  <sigh> fun fact: bocsimacko didn't write his bot in Lisp, Lisp wrote itself into bocsimacko's code
2010-12-06T05:18:27  <Naktibalda> AI language #1
2010-12-06T05:18:32  <BioMech> LOL
2010-12-06T05:18:51  <sigh> BioMech: in all seriousness, the language choice is that important
2010-12-06T05:19:07  <sigh> bocsimacko just happens to like Lisp :P
2010-12-06T05:19:57  <BioMech> I've read that LISP is great at creating list oriented logic however python can already do what LISP can and has more advance features then LISP...
2010-12-06T05:20:49  <BioMech> I'm still new on the subject, and programming languages to be honest. However I have teken a large interest in AI development.
2010-12-06T05:21:19  <sigh> then just start from the basics, the language doesn't matter for that
2010-12-06T05:21:41  <BioMech> Alright, have any ideas on where to start?
2010-12-06T05:23:08  <sigh> many ways, for example if you have a specific goal, then start a project... learn what you need to as you go
2010-12-06T05:24:01  <BioMech> That sounds like a good idea...
2010-12-06T05:24:50  <sigh> you can look up what you need to in various places, online, textbooks, academic papers...
2010-12-06T05:25:37  <sigh> you seem like you have specific interests, so I would just jump into it :)
2010-12-06T05:26:41  <BioMech> I'm going to be looking for good books on the subject soon, my specific goal is to wrtie not just a simple AI but a multi-level or multi-module based AI that is interconnected. Using a VM (Virtual Manchine) to allow the program to become self aware.
2010-12-06T05:27:13  <sigh> good luck :)
2010-12-06T05:27:29  <sigh> it will be challenging though, so you'll need to put in quite a bit of effort
2010-12-06T05:28:00  <BioMech> That's for sure, lol Yeah a program like this will take years to create...
2010-12-06T05:28:40  <BioMech> I have an idea on how I'm going to start it, but still not sure if there are better or more advance ways to do it. =)
2010-12-06T05:29:47  <sigh> try out your ideas, it's the only way... for every 1 good idea you have, you'll have 10 bad ones... and they only way to sort them out is to try
2010-12-06T05:30:18  <sigh> and as you go, you'll get experience, and you'll understand why the more advanced techniques work
2010-12-06T05:30:21  <BioMech> Good advice! :)
2010-12-06T05:31:38  <BioMech> Yes I'm planning on starting small, with a simple game AI... So the AI understands it's in a world however fake world but it will not know that. Then I plan to have other real life players interact with it.
2010-12-06T05:32:12  <sigh> yup, starting small is good
2010-12-06T05:32:17  <BioMech> It will be online 24 7 learning from real players. :)
2010-12-06T05:32:46  <BioMech> Do you know any simple free 3d shooter games?
2010-12-06T05:32:50  <BioMech> lol
2010-12-06T05:33:29  <BioMech> Or should I just be funny and start it in a MMO like world of warcraft or Star Trek online LOL
2010-12-06T05:36:30  <Naktibalda> it sounds like a big goal :)
2010-12-06T05:36:34  <sigh> I don't know, but I would start simple... lets you focus on the parts that you are interested in, allows you to try out ideas quicker, and there is less busy work required just to get a framework up an running
2010-12-06T05:37:16  <sigh> big goals aren't bad, but if you don't plan then you'll burn yourself out
2010-12-06T05:37:28  <Naktibalda> are you going to launch your own free server and monitor players?
2010-12-06T05:38:28  <BioMech> Yeah, it seams like the best way to do it.
2010-12-06T05:40:02  <BioMech> I already have a good game engine, the game will work on both PC and Mac. Or I might just make it web based with a web player so that any OS can access the game.
2010-12-06T05:42:34  <antimatroid1> woah!
2010-12-06T05:43:29  <sigh> antimatroid1: ?
2010-12-06T05:44:17  <antimatroid1> so much conversation
2010-12-06T05:44:20  <antimatroid1> hold on, i'm still reading
2010-12-06T05:44:31  <BioMech> lol Yeah
2010-12-06T05:46:28  <eashoka> <antimatroid1>, those servers seems to be down. do you know of any hosted TCP servers currently running or am I missing something ? I tried the java client to connect.
2010-12-06T05:46:28  <antimatroid1> BioMech: my personal advice would be to start with something like tron rather than planet wars
2010-12-06T05:46:46  <antimatroid1> eashoka: if they're not up you're pretty much out of luck sorry
2010-12-06T05:46:52  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: planet wars is *way* more fun
2010-12-06T05:46:58  <antimatroid1> you can download some of the better bots in the forums and play against them locally
2010-12-06T05:47:07  <antimatroid1> delt0r___: it's also way harder
2010-12-06T05:47:17  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure they're just getting into programming too
2010-12-06T05:47:28  <delt0r___> well only if you want to do min/max --
2010-12-06T05:47:35  <delt0r___> then tron is a better choice
2010-12-06T05:47:57  <delt0r___> planet wars is getting close to how hard i would like the AI comp
2010-12-06T05:48:07  <sigh> planetwars is harder, but I think it is more accessible
2010-12-06T05:48:12  <delt0r___> very simple rules --complicated dynamincs
2010-12-06T05:48:12  <sigh> if that makes any sense
2010-12-06T05:48:49  <delt0r___> I really want to move past the "can optimize" region... aka go or harder planet wars
2010-12-06T05:49:02  <BioMech> I see... Yeah I'm not trying to create a game AI that fights the human players. I'm trying to develop an AI that is self aware and learns and grows. It just happens to have control of a "in game" character
2010-12-06T05:49:13  <sigh> delt0r___: go is a very bad idea for a contest like that
2010-12-06T05:49:19  <sigh> *contest like this
2010-12-06T05:49:24  <delt0r___> I don't disagree
2010-12-06T05:49:40  <delt0r___> its the "general" direction i would like hardness to go in
2010-12-06T05:49:59  <sigh> fair enough
2010-12-06T05:50:00  <delt0r___> Its very hard to learn just to play
2010-12-06T05:50:02  <antimatroid1> delt0r___: it seems to me as thought they're most interested in learning some of the common ai techniques
2010-12-06T05:50:12  <antimatroid1> i think planet wars is a terrible place to start with that
2010-12-06T05:50:22  <antimatroid1> but i agree it's about where i'd like the bar to be set for ai contests
2010-12-06T05:50:28  <BioMech> So in other words what I'm trying to do is create an AI that believes it's alive and a real player and interact with other real players in the game.
2010-12-06T05:50:41  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: well i guess i am from the school that calls those things "machine learning" and "optimization"
2010-12-06T05:50:49  <antimatroid1> BioMech: you're getting way too far ahead of yourself ;)
2010-12-06T05:50:56  <sigh> I think planet wars went too much to the heuristic side
2010-12-06T05:51:11  <sigh> of course, there was no way to know that beforehand
2010-12-06T05:51:17  <antimatroid1> sigh: agreed, i tried to branch out but it was hard
2010-12-06T05:51:22  <BioMech> hahhaha thanks I think... but true I am, I'll just start small and grow it over the next few years.
2010-12-06T05:51:56  <antimatroid1> BioMech: why kind of background do you have? without trying to be an ass I'm guessing first year uni or around there?
2010-12-06T05:52:06  <delt0r___> BioMech: I would start with checkers or something like that...
2010-12-06T05:52:16  <antimatroid1> checkers is sequential
2010-12-06T05:52:20  <antimatroid1> simultaneous games are a lot of fun
2010-12-06T05:52:23  <delt0r___> that gets you the mix/max thing down nicely
2010-12-06T05:52:45  <BioMech> haha yes I'm a computer tech so I know a far amount about computer hardware. However programming is still new to me.
2010-12-06T05:52:55  <BioMech> fair*

2010-12-06T05:52:58  <antimatroid1> delt0r___: I personally think of machine learning and optimization for those things as sort of subsets of ai?
2010-12-06T05:53:00  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: true, but if learning the teqnices is the goal...
2010-12-06T05:53:05  <antimatroid1> i admit i don't have any real training in this area though
2010-12-06T05:53:11  <sigh> virtually any turn based board game is ok if you want to learn minimax :)
2010-12-06T05:53:23  <delt0r___> well i was into the ai scence before the bust
2010-12-06T05:53:54  <delt0r___> Thats why we try and call these things something that is more realistic... ie machine learning
2010-12-06T05:54:00  <delt0r___> rather than "AI"
2010-12-06T05:54:11  <delt0r___> most think Strong AI when they here that
2010-12-06T05:54:14  <antimatroid1> well pretty much nothing should be called ai imo :P
2010-12-06T05:54:37  <BioMech> I see, yeah with the new multi-core CPU's and the new advances in programming lanugages like the new Python 3 I think I'm going to try to write a multi-part AI
2010-12-06T05:54:39  <delt0r___> we may get there --eventually ... but we are pretty far from it right now
2010-12-06T05:55:14  <antimatroid1> BioMech: language really isn't important, just use what you're most familiar/comfortable with (provided it's not java :P)

2010-12-06T05:55:37  <antimatroid1> and no, nothing was proved about lisp by bocsimacko winning aha
2010-12-06T05:55:37  <delt0r___> Java is awesome !! :P

2010-12-06T05:56:09  <delt0r___> lisp is also awesome
2010-12-06T05:56:16  <BioMech> Hahaha I'm looking at Python, LISP, and C++ as my languages of choice.
2010-12-06T05:56:34  <delt0r___> Well i would start with Python
2010-12-06T05:56:51  <delt0r___> but learing all 3 wouldn't hurt... C++ if you want reall work
2010-12-06T05:57:19  <delt0r___> Java isn't going anywhere in a hurry
2010-12-06T05:57:26  <sigh> I would start on python, nothing precludes you from using more later :)
2010-12-06T05:57:35  <delt0r___> C# is nice... but if you not on windows YMMV

2010-12-06T05:58:03  <BioMech_> I'm back sorry timed out or something.
2010-12-06T05:58:18  <delt0r___> C is ok if you want to work on kernel code or mix in a lot of assembler... but C++ does that well too
2010-12-06T05:58:42  <delt0r___> Oh... I don't get those msgs... may need to read the logs
2010-12-06T05:58:55  <BioMech_> Yeah I'm trying to stay in the dynamic lanaguges like LISP and Python however any low level stuff I'll do in C++
2010-12-06T05:59:08  <delt0r___> I wouldn't
2010-12-06T05:59:20  <delt0r___> Only optimize once you know you need to
2010-12-06T05:59:32  <antimatroid1> i would tell someone to learn stuff in pything -> c/c++ -> something like haskell, but i'm not very experienced either :)
2010-12-06T05:59:40  <delt0r___> C++ can be fast... but like most lanuages... it can also be slow
2010-12-06T06:00:10  <sigh> haha
2010-12-06T06:00:11  <delt0r___> Well i think one from each family is a good start
2010-12-06T06:00:22  <delt0r___> so C/pascal
2010-12-06T06:00:26  <delt0r___> C++/java
2010-12-06T06:00:40  <delt0r___> lisp/Scheme/Haskell/ML

2010-12-06T06:01:49  <sigh> haskell can be challenging though
2010-12-06T06:01:58  <delt0r___> oh yea
2010-12-06T06:02:09  <delt0r___> and enlightening.
2010-12-06T06:02:13  <sigh> :)
2010-12-06T06:02:57  <sigh> although, at my uni they used to teach it in their intro to programming subject :P
2010-12-06T06:03:09  <delt0r___> lol
2010-12-06T06:03:11  <antimatroid1> yeah i've heard anu do that too
2010-12-06T06:03:13  <antimatroid1> we got java :(
2010-12-06T06:03:26  <delt0r___> get em before they think procedurally or in OO

2010-12-06T06:03:55  <sigh> by the time I got there, it was C first semester, haskell second
2010-12-06T06:03:59  <antimatroid1> it's self admitted pet hate :)
2010-12-06T06:04:15  <delt0r___> we did pascal
2010-12-06T06:04:18  * Naktibalda had word an excel in first year :)
2010-12-06T06:04:23  <delt0r___> lol
2010-12-06T06:04:26  <sigh> haha
2010-12-06T06:04:40  <Naktibalda> and Fortran :)
2010-12-06T06:04:40  <antimatroid1> speaking off, i want to kill the people who made the new menu in office 2007
2010-12-06T06:05:00  <delt0r___> I havn't used MS windows for years
2010-12-06T06:05:19  <antimatroid1> i don't install it at home these days, but i need to use excelt with data for work
2010-12-06T06:05:44  <delt0r___> bummer
2010-12-06T06:05:46  <antimatroid1> if it's not good enough for LaTeX, notepad will do
2010-12-06T06:05:58  <delt0r___> I used to charge and extra 30% for working on windows
2010-12-06T06:06:07  <antimatroid1> hehe
2010-12-06T06:06:23  <delt0r___> To my surprise many companies paid it
2010-12-06T06:06:58  <Naktibalda> that's an idea
2010-12-06T06:09:51  <Meatkat> Hey all, looking for 1-2 more to make a team for BattleCode see (http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1214) for more info.
2010-12-06T06:14:09  <delt0r___> Meatkat: wow... looks cool
2010-12-06T06:14:23  <antimatroid1> i'd be happy to take a look, but i can't really guarantee you much time :\
2010-12-06T06:14:23  <sigh> yeah, that's interesting
2010-12-06T06:14:28  <sigh> what language is it in?
2010-12-06T06:14:33  <delt0r___> java
2010-12-06T06:14:39  <antimatroid1> scratch that, i'm out :)
2010-12-06T06:14:39  <delt0r___> well JVM
2010-12-06T06:14:42  <Meatkat> Java
2010-12-06T06:14:45  <sigh> haha, that rules out antimatroid1 :P
2010-12-06T06:14:55  <delt0r___> so I guess anything that can be jared.
2010-12-06T06:15:12  <delt0r___> Scheme, Clojure etc should work fine
2010-12-06T06:15:17  <antimatroid1> i expected more from mit D:
2010-12-06T06:15:30  <Meatkat> I think with the talent that we have here we could make a pretty strong showing, maybe even take it all
2010-12-06T06:15:49  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: dude whats your problem with java? your not one of those C pointer zombies are you?
2010-12-06T06:15:58  <Meatkat> Well they are doing the byte-code limit thing, and they've been using/upgrading the same code for about 10 years
2010-12-06T06:16:12  <antimatroid1> no, i just can't stand programming in java personally, there is so much extra crap i'm meant to learn
2010-12-06T06:16:18  <Meatkat> sigh: you interested?
2010-12-06T06:16:50  <antimatroid1> does java even have vectors?
2010-12-06T06:16:57  <antimatroid1> there's no operator or function overloading right?
2010-12-06T06:16:59  <sigh> yeah, it looks interesting
2010-12-06T06:17:02  <antimatroid1> or variable overloading for that matter?
2010-12-06T06:17:18  <sigh> not sure how much time this will eat up though
2010-12-06T06:17:32  <antimatroid1> i would cry going without those things now that i have them
2010-12-06T06:18:12  <Meatkat> sigh: 'this' being GAIC? or BattleCode
2010-12-06T06:18:54  <sigh> Battlecode
2010-12-06T06:20:13  <Meatkat> I'd imagine it's going to be about as intense as this competition was, though with teams of four we won't have to have everyone going 100% at any given time
2010-12-06T06:21:40  <sigh> fair enough
2010-12-06T06:22:27  <sigh> have you worked in projects like this before (as in over the internet)? how do you plan to coordinate?
2010-12-06T06:24:09  <Meatkat> Not exactly like this, but things similar, yes. I'm planning to use mercurial, as well as version control they offer ticket creating / issue tracking
2010-12-06T06:24:48  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: Don't you use C++ --because well java has vectors in the same sence that C++ has them
2010-12-06T06:25:11  <Meatkat> beyond that we'll see what sort of communication works for everyone, maybe have a specified time 1/week for a debriefing of the week, etcc..
2010-12-06T06:25:46  <sigh> i see
2010-12-06T06:26:01  <sigh> i'm really tempted :)

2010-12-06T06:40:42  <antimatroid1> delt0r___: I do, but i still don't know why java doesn't allow any kind of overloading
2010-12-06T06:40:53  <antimatroid1> and the amount of crap one needs to write just for a hello world app is retarded
2010-12-06T06:41:41  <Meatkat> System.out.println("Hello world!")
2010-12-06T06:42:14  <Meatkat> public static void main (String[] args) { }
2010-12-06T06:42:19  <Meatkat> around it
2010-12-06T06:42:28  <Meatkat> soo.... 2 lines?
2010-12-06T06:42:37  <antimatroid1> int main()
2010-12-06T06:42:59  <antimatroid1> public static void main(String[] args) is insanely long
2010-12-06T06:43:48  <sigh> as opposed to int main(int argv, char** argc) ?
2010-12-06T06:44:12  <antimatroid1> can you leave it blank in java?
2010-12-06T06:44:24  <antimatroid1> i really don't use it, like i said before, it's more a personal pet hate than anything

2010-12-06T07:02:13  <Error323> ^_^
2010-12-06T07:02:21  <sigh> :P
2010-12-06T07:03:06  <antimatroid1> i try not to spend too much time thinking about actual politics
2010-12-06T07:03:30  <antimatroid1> it makes my blood boil
2010-12-06T07:03:51  <sigh> yeah... australian politics sucks :(
2010-12-06T07:04:36  <antimatroid1> so does american :P
2010-12-06T07:05:02  <Meatkat> (i'm sensing a trend)
2010-12-06T07:05:58  <Error323> haha
2010-12-06T07:06:07  <antimatroid1> my problem with politics in the current day and age can basically be summed as follows...
2010-12-06T07:06:08  <antimatroid1> it's just one big popularity contest on who gets to make the decisions, we don't even get to pick between the most qualified people for the positions (KRudd had a Chinese degree!), you don't let someone become a doctor or engineer just because they think they could do a good job, no matter how good their intentions are
2010-12-06T07:06:20  <antimatroid1> of course there are many more problems, but i think that's my biggest issue
2010-12-06T07:07:23  <Meatkat> How do you propose that we measure their capacity/ability to govern?
2010-12-06T07:08:07  <sigh> start an AI contest to optimise leadership selection
2010-12-06T07:09:02  <Meatkat> haha
2010-12-06T07:09:15  <Meatkat> Well one day hopefully we can make an AI that will be governing
2010-12-06T07:09:34  <Meatkat> (or maybe an AI that we make will make an AI that will govern)
2010-12-06T07:09:44  <sigh> ah yes... nothing can go wrong with that plan
2010-12-06T07:09:51  <Meatkat> nope :)
2010-12-06T07:10:18  <Meatkat> I, for one, will welcome our AI overlords
2010-12-06T07:10:28  <antimatroid1> if i was given dictator like rights over how to run my own society.. I would separate the top role out into more distinctive roles, then set certain requirements to fill certain positions (like handle anything economicsy, you should have an education in economics, not be picking who you want to listen to, handling education, have a background in it please, don't just get the position because that's what was left for you on your party)
2010-12-06T07:10:31  <antimatroid1> etc. etc.
2010-12-06T07:10:48  <antimatroid1> i could argue those things with you till you starved to death :P (i have an economics degree)
2010-12-06T07:11:09  <sigh> I think the long term solution is a better educated and informed public
2010-12-06T07:11:10  <antimatroid1> i don't imagine we'd be around long if we had ai overlords
2010-12-06T07:11:26  <antimatroid1> sigh: see my last sentence :)

2010-12-06T07:17:33  <sigh> haha
2010-12-06T07:17:34  <antimatroid1> i ended up passing it to julia, because i hate abbott so much
2010-12-06T07:18:07  <sigh> yeah... well, I didn't mind gillard then

2010-12-06T07:19:22  <antimatroid1> he screwed up and missed someone the first time, so had to ask for a second sheet to make sure he got it right ehe
2010-12-06T07:19:31  <antimatroid1> such as?

2010-12-06T07:20:09  <sigh> comments like that

2010-12-06T07:21:05  <sigh> and why your votes wont be "wasted" if you vote for a minority
2010-12-06T07:21:11  <rabidus_> basicly every game is turn based.. its only matter of resolution

2010-12-06T07:23:02  <sigh> I've had the same idea, but I haven't looked into the implications much at all
2010-12-06T07:23:44  <antimatroid1> i haven't done it in depth, i did some playing around on paper when someone said that to me, but i was more just guessing at how i think the preferential rankings flow through

2010-12-06T07:26:42  <Error323> wuuuut
2010-12-06T07:26:50  <Error323> I wanna go snooooowboarding
2010-12-06T07:26:51  <sigh> antimatroid1: of course, that implies that an informal vote should be perfectly legit
2010-12-06T07:27:07  <sigh> (i think that's a good thing... it is stupid that it is illegal)
2010-12-06T07:29:05  <antimatroid1> it's not possible to have private votes and not informal votes :P
2010-12-06T07:29:18  <antimatroid1> and you also don't get called out unless you registered to vote then don't
2010-12-06T07:29:25  <antimatroid1> if you never register, they don't do anything to you
2010-12-06T07:29:49  <sigh> they kept sending me letters until I registered
2010-12-06T07:30:10  <antimatroid1> yeah, that's not really what i meant :P
2010-12-06T07:30:27  <sigh> those letters were mean :(
2010-12-06T07:30:45  <antimatroid1> Error323: me too, i've only been for one day in my life, hardly enough time to learn anything other than "it's allll in the hips" thanks chubs
2010-12-06T07:30:55  <antimatroid1> why?
2010-12-06T07:31:14  <sigh> haha... to be honest I can't remember them now
2010-12-06T07:31:37  <sigh> Error323: that video was all skiing, not snowboarding :P
2010-12-06T07:31:46  <antimatroid1> i like the quote "the best argument against democracy is a conversation with the average voter"
2010-12-06T07:32:09  <sigh> antimatroid1: are there good mountains for snow in tas?
2010-12-06T07:33:34  <antimatroid1> no, not at all
2010-12-06T07:33:53  <antimatroid1> mount wellington is really close which is awesome just cause it's so close, but never get enough snow to properly snowboard
2010-12-06T07:33:53  <sigh> ah, that sucks
2010-12-06T07:34:12  <antimatroid1> there is some mountain a few hours away people do ski/snowboard on, but it's meant to be pretty crap i think
2010-12-06T07:34:45  <antimatroid1> i just had to grow up skateboarding instead
2010-12-06T07:34:59  <sigh> :P
2010-12-06T07:35:56  <Error323> sigh: also snowboarding
2010-12-06T07:36:01  <Error323> but less yes =)
2010-12-06T07:36:08  <Error323> love that music too
2010-12-06T07:36:57  <sigh> :P
2010-12-06T07:37:26  <Error323> can't figure out whois it is though
2010-12-06T07:38:29  <antimatroid1> whose? :)
2010-12-06T07:38:40  <antimatroid1> woah, if that's spelled right it looks terrible
2010-12-06T07:38:45  <antimatroid1> whose that is
2010-12-06T07:39:06  <Error323> ahhh srry
2010-12-06T07:39:13  <Error323> i was thinking mmm this doesn't look right :P
2010-12-06T07:43:24  <Error323> hmmm MIT's battlecode is cool
2010-12-06T07:43:32  <Error323> saw it last year, but was too late to enter
2010-12-06T07:44:16  <delt0r> Error323, I like the lang choice you have for this one. Odd that Mit doesn't do it for battlecode
2010-12-06T07:44:29  <delt0r> but java works for me anyways
2010-12-06T07:46:32  <Error323> delt0r: yeah language choice here is nice
2010-12-06T07:46:43  <Error323> but their students probably learn java
2010-12-06T07:47:06  <Error323> and in the end its all the same anyway :P
2010-12-06T07:48:41  <antimatroid1> i expect mit to teach them more than java :\
2010-12-06T07:48:45  <antimatroid1> it's mit afterall
2010-12-06T07:48:59  <Error323> java is good for learning imo
2010-12-06T07:49:09  <Error323> c++ is more overwhelming
2010-12-06T07:49:18  <Error323> with all its bloat
2010-12-06T07:49:25  <Error323> xD
2010-12-06T07:49:43  <antimatroid1> you don't need to know much c++ to actually get started imo and i would probably choose to start with python if i started over
2010-12-06T07:49:55  <antimatroid1> i still don't know much c++
2010-12-06T07:50:20  <Error323> to get started maybe, but i bet they prefer you create good code
2010-12-06T07:50:26  <Error323> xD
2010-12-06T07:51:35  <sigh> they haven't realised that Lisp is the best language yet
2010-12-06T07:52:21  <Error323> there's a good chance they learn that too
2010-12-06T07:53:12  <antimatroid1> sigh: :P
2010-12-06T07:53:21  <Error323> i wanna get the code
2010-12-06T07:53:22  <dmj111> i imagine everyone has seen this... http://danweinreb.org/blog/why-did-mit-switch-from-scheme-to-python
2010-12-06T07:53:25  <Error323> but don't wanna register P:
2010-12-06T07:54:01  <sigh> dmj111: it's clearly because they didn't have bocsimacko's win as proof yet
2010-12-06T07:55:44  <dmj111> ahh, of course :)
2010-12-06T07:56:25  <Error323> =]
2010-12-06T07:56:31  <delt0r> Error323, I dont' think the code/game is available till the 2nd of jan or whatever
2010-12-06T07:56:43  <antimatroid1> what irks me is when mythbusters say the "bust" a myth
2010-12-06T07:57:00  <Error323> delt0r: ah that explains
2010-12-06T07:57:14  <delt0r> antimatroid1, their version of the scientific method is also a bit dubious
2010-12-06T07:57:16  <antimatroid1> they can only really confirm it, and i would let them off if they only did it when they had lots of decent attempts, but sometimes they claim it with one poor attempt
2010-12-06T07:57:33  <antimatroid1> it is, but i have to take what i can get these days :(
2010-12-06T07:57:43  <dmj111> what, you mean a few runs of an experiment isn't proof?
2010-12-06T07:57:45  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sick of the internets hard on for carl sagan though
2010-12-06T07:57:58  <antimatroid1> too*
2010-12-06T07:58:00  <delt0r> carl who?
2010-12-06T07:58:04  <delt0r> ;)
2010-12-06T07:58:52  <delt0r> dmj111, indendant replication of results is an important part of "experimental Proof"
2010-12-06T07:59:10  <sigh> antimatroid1: you mean you don't want to create an apple pie from scratch? :P
2010-12-06T07:59:36  <dmj111> </humour attempt>
2010-12-06T07:59:41  <delt0r> oh
2010-12-06T08:00:05  * delt0r whoosh 
2010-12-06T08:00:09  <dmj111> i am bad enough at it in person, let alone over text only.
2010-12-06T08:00:14  <delt0r> lol
2010-12-06T08:00:21  <antimatroid1> sigh: i start by creating my elements :)
2010-12-06T08:00:43  <sigh> I just say random things, and people either think I'm joking or think I'm stupid
2010-12-06T08:00:50  <sigh> I'm ok, either way
2010-12-06T08:01:10  <antimatroid1> people have always considered me stupid
2010-12-06T08:01:10  <dmj111> yeah, i try to manage expectations by saying dumb things alot.
2010-12-06T08:01:26  <antimatroid1> although quite a lot have turned around to thinking i'm a super genius
2010-12-06T08:01:42  <antimatroid1> i don't think i'm particularly smart though, i know plenty of people at my uni who are far brighter than i
2010-12-06T08:02:01  <antimatroid1> and it's not a particularly big uni

2010-12-06T08:05:38  <Error323> how can I active a second DISPLAY
2010-12-06T08:05:43  * antimatroid1 has a bit of an obsession with mr neumann
2010-12-06T08:05:45  <Error323> not a second monitor
2010-12-06T08:05:55  <Error323> but more X environments
2010-12-06T08:06:21  <delt0r> Error323, Oh i have done that
2010-12-06T08:06:42  <delt0r> so there are a number of ways
2010-12-06T08:06:52  <Error323> cool
2010-12-06T08:07:06  <delt0r> you can have different X sessions under F7-F9 IIRC
2010-12-06T08:07:14  <Error323> exactly
2010-12-06T08:07:21  <Error323> but they are not activated yet
2010-12-06T08:07:54  <delt0r> But its gets tricky to run different configs... without using X [bazillion args]
2010-12-06T08:07:58  <delt0r> rather than startx
2010-12-06T08:08:30  <Error323> mm
2010-12-06T08:08:46  <delt0r> man startx
2010-12-06T08:08:53  <delt0r> ops... wrong window
2010-12-06T08:08:59  <Error323> haha
2010-12-06T08:09:02  <sigh> :P
2010-12-06T08:09:28  <Error323> well startx is a script, i can see the display being spun up standard, can i just change that for a new instance?
2010-12-06T08:09:47  <delt0r> startx -- :1
2010-12-06T08:09:55  <delt0r> http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/multiple-x.html
2010-12-06T08:10:03  <Error323> oh sweetness
2010-12-06T08:10:47  <delt0r> I managed to run one machine as a dual seat system... getting 2 mice to work was a little tricky at the time
2010-12-06T08:11:26  <Error323> haha yeah
2010-12-06T08:11:39  <Error323> thanks delt0r !! it works like a charm
2010-12-06T08:11:44  <delt0r> np
2010-12-06T08:12:26  <Frontier> wow, a linux xorg-server discussion on #aichallenge ;) . Keep the channel busy guys!
2010-12-06T08:12:36  <Error323> :P
2010-12-06T08:12:55  <delt0r> well no one is too silly with the OT stuff here.... right ?
2010-12-06T08:13:51  <Frontier> There were DOS games that used two mice on COM1 and COM2 for multiplayer. Like The Settlers 2. It took me a week to finally find logitech drivers that didn't crash randomly in this operation mode.
2010-12-06T08:14:20  <delt0r> yea... and dune2 with split screen iirc
2010-12-06T08:14:35  <Frontier> ...and The Settlers 3 had an awful AI <- back on topic. Ha!
2010-12-06T08:14:42  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure the channel will even die this time?
2010-12-06T08:14:47  <antimatroid1> i think it did after tron
2010-12-06T08:14:55  <delt0r> but we got doom and warcraft to work under a null modem link
2010-12-06T08:15:01  <delt0r> pure awesomeness
2010-12-06T08:15:15  <Frontier> COM or LPT? LPT used to be faster for a while
2010-12-06T08:15:21  <delt0r> com
2010-12-06T08:15:27  <delt0r> null modem was com
2010-12-06T08:15:39  <delt0r> the "fake" token ring was LPT
2010-12-06T08:15:53  <Frontier> these games had a very robust network code. some didnt even register a disconnect ^^
2010-12-06T08:15:55  <delt0r> I even wrote a TSR "driver" to do that
2010-12-06T08:16:02  <delt0r> lol
2010-12-06T08:17:11  <Frontier> In that time I was merely starting to look at the source code of QBASIC gorillaz and nibbles
2010-12-06T08:17:37  <antimatroid1> sigh: the writer of mr squiggle died :(
2010-12-06T08:17:51  <sigh> :(
2010-12-06T08:18:06  <delt0r> I was doing x86 "protected mode" crap or not "protected mode" crap in asm
2010-12-06T08:20:39  <Frontier> ok later on at a vocational (<- correct spelling) school in ASM class I wrote an animated GIF viewer of pure awesomeness ^^ with 320x240 res, 256 colors.
2010-12-06T08:20:54  <delt0r> cool
2010-12-06T08:21:03  <Error323> i never touched asm
2010-12-06T08:21:06  <Error323> :$
2010-12-06T08:21:10  <delt0r> I hate x86 asm
2010-12-06T08:21:33  <Frontier> that is why i want a ai-challenge compo like RoboCom, that uses assembly like code :p
2010-12-06T08:21:35  <delt0r> some DSPs and things like the AVR have awesome instruction sets
2010-12-06T08:22:00  <delt0r> Frontier, but then its not a ai challenge, its a code stuff challenge...
2010-12-06T08:23:01  <Frontier> exactly. it is cool to see what a single instruction can do on some processors. even div and modulo are the two results of ONE instruction on x86 for example.
2010-12-06T08:23:41  <Frontier> delt0r: Some people would even argue that chess is an AI problem, when you can just iterate over the possible moves and do your A/B stuff.
2010-12-06T08:24:18  <delt0r> I guess.
2010-12-06T08:24:27  <delt0r> but let folk choose the tool
2010-12-06T08:24:49  <delt0r> the top ten had, lisp,c#,c++ java and almost python
2010-12-06T08:25:49  <delt0r> I think even letting pure executable or *.jar files would work with virtulization.
2010-12-06T08:25:57  <antimatroid1> Frontier: if one wanted to class chess as not AI, then i'd argue pretty much every other game is the same ;)
2010-12-06T08:26:05  <delt0r> then you don't even need an official starter pack
2010-12-06T08:26:45  <Error323> its the father of ai =)
2010-12-06T08:26:52  <Error323> ai games :P
2010-12-06T08:26:58  <Frontier> Amiraa is a game created to have a branching factor and start setup that makes it difficult to use opening books or "simple" iterations. Take a look at it.
2010-12-06T08:27:08  <Error323> we did
2010-12-06T08:27:15  <Error323> i don't like it :P
2010-12-06T08:27:55  <delt0r> Frontier, Go is better in this regard IMO--without a $10000 prize however
2010-12-06T08:28:40  <antimatroid1> i'm not a huge fan of bored* games either
2010-12-06T08:28:47  <Error323> ahhhahaha
2010-12-06T08:28:48  <Frontier> did you know the office manager of our foreign minister worked for the us embassy?
2010-12-06T08:29:11  <Error323> go is pretty fascinating
2010-12-06T08:29:16  <Error323> with its simple pieces
2010-12-06T08:29:21  <antimatroid1> planet wars was great, i wasn't a fan of how much it was all heuristics at the end though
2010-12-06T08:29:23  <delt0r> its really hard to play
2010-12-06T08:29:47  <delt0r> you start by thinking of what the other guy could do... and splat...you brain turns off
2010-12-06T08:29:47  <antimatroid1> just because somethings hard, doesn't make it necessarily fun for every person
2010-12-06T08:29:56  <antimatroid1> those are merely my preferences :)
2010-12-06T08:29:57  <Error323> I don't like Amiraa because it was engineerd for computers to be hard <--- lame :P
2010-12-06T08:30:15  <Error323> delt0r: hahaha indd
2010-12-06T08:30:27  <Frontier> I wouldn't mind a go challenge either. I just took a look at it and it seems to be inviting, just like PlanetWars. Simple rules, many possible tactics.
2010-12-06T08:30:40  <Error323> but fascinating how we can do it better than computers (we being good go players)
2010-12-06T08:31:23  <Error323> though I guess its the same line of thought chess players / programmers had
2010-12-06T08:31:24  <delt0r> yea---patterns... we can "match" bazillions of patterns...
2010-12-06T08:31:30  <delt0r> well thats the theory
2010-12-06T08:33:14  <Error323> I've been given the book "The art of war" by Sun-Tzu

2010-12-06T18:34:15  <Frontier> It's like a mix of RoboCom and PlanetWars. You code in a real programming language, but each bot runs in a virtual machine.
2010-12-06T18:34:21  <burny> they shouldn't even be allowed to clal it code, if it's java only
2010-12-06T18:35:32  <Frontier> You can also code in C ... and convert it to Java: http://download.cnet.com/C-To-Java-Converter/3000-2213_4-10080009.html
2010-12-06T18:36:40  <Frontier> I guess the MIT can just SET the standards :)
2010-12-06T18:41:31  <antimatroid1> meh, if they're going to enforce java they're  not going to get me
2010-12-06T18:41:39  <antimatroid1> i don't think it's a huge loss for them anyway :P

2010-12-06T18:47:19  <burny> I'm gona make my bot so it has a bunch of exe's in the 'tools' directory, with names like "add.exe" and "mul.exe".. most of them will take 2 parmaters, and have a single return value.. this way java won't be so slow
2010-12-06T18:47:58  <Frontier> The only guy from MIT I know is Gordon Freeman.

2010-12-06T18:49:19  <Zannick> C to java converter D:
2010-12-06T18:51:32  <antimatroid1> Zannick: at least it's not the other way around :P
2010-12-06T18:52:10  <burny> the other way around sucks to impliment
2010-12-06T18:52:10  <Zannick> meh
2010-12-06T18:52:22  <burny> stupid java's total lack of proper memory managment
2010-12-06T18:52:29  <Frontier> oh yeah. generic types and inheritence in C
2010-12-06T18:52:50  <Zannick> oh yeah
2010-12-06T18:52:50  <burny> ya, that too..
2010-12-06T18:52:56  <burny> and multiple inheritence is annoying also
2010-12-06T18:53:01  <Frontier> burny: You can call the garbage collector any time you see appropriate.
2010-12-06T18:53:08  <antimatroid1> and lack of ability to overload like anything
2010-12-06T18:53:12  <Zannick> there isn't multiple inheritance in java
2010-12-06T18:53:19  <Zannick> unless you mean interfaces
2010-12-06T18:53:25  <burny> frontier.. we were porting java apps to cellphones :P
2010-12-06T18:53:28  <antimatroid1> can you define operators at all in java?
2010-12-06T18:53:35  <Error323> no
2010-12-06T18:53:56  <antimatroid1> i define operators for shit all the time :\
2010-12-06T18:54:13  <antimatroid1> it's especially helpful in c++ where I can just write a class, define < then have priority queues of it
2010-12-06T18:54:28  <Zannick> one of my favorite things i did in SML a few years ago was redefine + to be vector addition
2010-12-06T18:54:30  <burny> int x = a*b;  turns into   int x(a.multiply(b));
2010-12-06T18:54:38  <burny> so, who cares?
2010-12-06T18:54:50  <Frontier> well... an operator is no more than a function call, so use that in java Class.add() for example or Class.assign()
2010-12-06T18:54:55  <antimatroid1> I do, it's ugly, especially if you want to do a whole equation
2010-12-06T18:55:04  <antimatroid1> imagine I had matrices all set up in java
2010-12-06T18:55:07  <burny> you don't have to TYPE it..
2010-12-06T18:55:11  <burny> if it does c->java
2010-12-06T18:55:33  <antimatroid1> it'd be like
2010-12-06T18:55:33  <antimatroid1> C = inverse(multiple(transpose(X), X)) etc.
2010-12-06T18:55:48  <Frontier> Java has some awesome IDEs that make you type less in effect.
2010-12-06T18:55:52  <antimatroid1> multiply*
2010-12-06T18:56:06  <sigh> hmmm... c to java would be annoying
2010-12-06T18:56:11  <antimatroid1> Frontier: why not just include operator overloading? it doesn't make any sense not to have it :\
2010-12-06T18:56:12  <sigh> how do you handle unsigned ints
2010-12-06T18:56:40  <Frontier> sigh: with a long and some range checks for overflows
2010-12-06T18:57:21  <Frontier> antimatroid: I guess operator overloading has some side effects that noone wants to see in Java.
2010-12-06T18:57:44  <antimatroid1> what side effects?
2010-12-06T18:57:46  <sigh> Frontier: yeah, I guess that's the only way
2010-12-06T18:57:49  <antimatroid1> people are too retarded to use it properly?
2010-12-06T18:58:11  * antimatroid1 needs to drop his rage from reading reddit for half an hour..
2010-12-06T18:58:30  <Frontier> You can ... write retarded code like operator+(Integer n) { return this->value - n.value; }
2010-12-06T18:58:31  <sigh> use it properly? like using bit shift operator for streams?
2010-12-06T18:58:36  <burny> clealry lisp is the best language for AI
2010-12-06T18:58:54  <antimatroid1> burny: it's been proven
2010-12-06T18:58:56  *** bhasker_ <bhasker_!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-vynmkpnkeycapnuk> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-06T18:59:29  <Zannick> indeed
2010-12-06T18:59:44  <Zannick> as all languages are secretly lisp, lisp is therefore the best language for ai
2010-12-06T18:59:48  <sigh> all programs written in lisp run in polynomial time
2010-12-06T19:00:14  <Frontier> operator overloading comes in handy, but it can be confusing. Java is more of a clear language. You can quickly get into new code you've never seen before without knowing the way the other programmer writes, because there is only the one Java way to write code.
2010-12-06T19:00:23  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-tmgeoheurnilvyvo> has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
2010-12-06T19:00:52  <burny> also.. it's safe to assume that java does nothing :)
2010-12-06T19:01:25  <sigh> Frontier: eh? Java doesn't instantly make the code readable
2010-12-06T19:01:27  <Frontier> Have you seen the proposals for the next C++ standard C++0x?
2010-12-06T19:01:39  <burny> he didn't say it was readable..
2010-12-06T19:01:46  <burny> he said there was only one way to write it
2010-12-06T19:02:00  <Zannick> not really
2010-12-06T19:02:31  <antimatroid1> meh, I like simple concise powerful code
2010-12-06T19:02:38  <sigh> burny: yeah, I'd have to disagree with that
2010-12-06T19:02:43  <antimatroid1> not long, hard to read but very unambiguous code
2010-12-06T19:02:49  <Zannick> you could store event handlers as a list of handlers or as a single Multicaster that contains two subhandlers, which could be Multicasters again
2010-12-06T19:03:14  <Zannick> java won't save your code from bad design
2010-12-06T19:03:23  <burny> leelo dallas, multicast!
2010-12-06T19:03:26  <antimatroid1> simple and concise yet using c++, i'm doing it wrong :P
2010-12-06T19:03:42  <Frontier> in c++ you can use a method, an overloaded operator or a friend function to do an addition, in java you can only use a method i guess. that's what i wanted to point out

2010-12-06T19:04:59  <Zannick> you can do a static addition that returns a new result, or an in-place addition that changes the object invoked upon
2010-12-06T19:05:23  <Zannick> or even invoke on an object but still return a new one
2010-12-06T19:05:59  <burny> or you can pass a message to a tcpip socket, and wait for a response from an internet based addition server
2010-12-06T19:06:10  <Frontier> you can do that in java too
2010-12-06T19:06:25  <Zannick> i'm talking about java
2010-12-06T19:07:48  <Frontier> Some examples of valid C++0X: a string literal: u8R"XXX(I'm a "raw UTF-8" string.)XXX"
2010-12-06T19:08:49  <antimatroid1> ^^ i don't see how that is any easier to learn than c++ :\

2010-12-06T19:08:54  <antimatroid1> yet people say java is easier
2010-12-06T19:09:43  <sigh> antimatroid1: ? he's talking about c++
2010-12-06T19:10:29  <Frontier> And best of all an adding function - fasten your seatbelts:
2010-12-06T19:10:31  <Frontier> template< typename Lhs, typename Rhs>
2010-12-06T19:10:31  <Frontier>   auto adding_func(const Lhs &lhs, const Rhs &rhs) -> decltype(lhs+rhs) {return lhs + rhs;}
2010-12-06T19:11:40  <sigh> is decltype a new thing?
2010-12-06T19:12:16  <Frontier> sigh: Yes the compiler will replace it by whatever the expression turns out to be.
2010-12-06T19:12:52  <Frontier> and somehow this line will also make the auto in the beginning turn into what decltype returns
2010-12-06T19:13:56  <Frontier> A new way to call constructors are initializer lists. They are cool to fill up arrays, but may look odd on objects: Object var2{2, 4.3};
