2011-05-31T03:39:29  <McLeopold> so, a bot timeout causes the ant data to be short?
2011-05-31T03:40:18  <McLeopold> why the 2 allowable lengths in the first place?
2011-05-31T03:40:21  <Frontier> yes, in case you want the game to run that turn anyway even if a bot timed out, and you said you want it that way
2011-05-31T03:40:52  <Frontier> because otherwise the ants would have a dying animation in the last turn
2011-05-31T03:41:38  <Frontier> I could not distinguish a surviving ant from a dying ant.

2011-05-31T03:45:28  <sir_macelon> well, i think i have found another bug in the game engine
2011-05-31T03:45:40  <McLeopold> do tell
2011-05-31T03:46:03  <Frontier> McLeopold: If you want that bot's ants to be displayed for that turn they need a '-' as their move.
2011-05-31T03:46:39  <sir_macelon> if a newly spawned ant gets a vision over a new tile where an enemy ant has died this turn then the engine sends something like 'd row col None'
2011-05-31T03:47:21  <sir_macelon> it crashed my bot and probably every bot would crash in such situation where it expects player id to parse integer value
2011-05-31T03:48:13  <Frontier> yeah my bot would throw an exception there, too
2011-05-31T03:48:36  <Frontier> only JavaScript would think this is 'None' == 0
2011-05-31T03:49:07  <sir_macelon> generally ant wasn't supposed to see this battle resolution as it has spawned after it
2011-05-31T03:49:08  <Frontier> but! I don't parse death lines, hehe.

2011-05-31T03:49:45  <sir_macelon> every starter bot does that
2011-05-31T03:50:01  <McLeopold> Frontier: php might survive it too...

2011-05-31T03:56:44  <McLeopold> good for you
2011-05-31T03:56:53  <antimatroid1> the engine the tcp server uses should NOT have bots select their moves sequentially
2011-05-31T03:56:54  <McLeopold> you must not have been reading reddit :[
2011-05-31T03:57:00  <antimatroid1> games will take n times longer than necessary pretty much
2011-05-31T03:57:16  <antimatroid1> you guys might have already thought of that, just making sure :)
2011-05-31T03:57:22  <McLeopold> yeah, we did
2011-05-31T03:57:25  <antimatroid1> :)
2011-05-31T03:57:46  <antimatroid1> ignore me then
2011-05-31T03:58:10  <McLeopold> so, is food spawning on symmetric maps symmetric even for the starting food?
2011-05-31T03:58:26  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-05-31T03:58:33  <antimatroid1> with symmetric spawning turned on
2011-05-31T03:58:45  <antimatroid1> it wont be symmetric depending on where ants are located
2011-05-31T03:58:52  <McLeopold> what if I have 5 bots and request 71 starting food squares?
2011-05-31T03:58:57  <antimatroid1> but if a deterministic bot played itself, the result would be a draw
2011-05-31T03:59:01  <aerique> compile error messages look sweet now on the submission page, thanks
2011-05-31T03:59:13  <McLeopold> aerique: glad you like it
2011-05-31T03:59:15  <antimatroid1> i think that's 71 starting food squares per bot
2011-05-31T03:59:23  <McLeopold> oh
2011-05-31T03:59:38  <antimatroid1> i could be wrong, but i vaguely remember playing around with what I think you're talking about myself
2011-05-31T03:59:42  <McLeopold> no, it still uses a percentage of land_area
2011-05-31T03:59:49  <antimatroid1> hmm okay
2011-05-31T03:59:59  <McLeopold> we need to get that fixed...

2011-05-31T04:06:29  <McLeopold> which are lower
2011-05-31T04:06:37  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-05-31T04:06:45  <McLeopold> I think far less ants will be better
2011-05-31T04:06:58  <antimatroid1> yeah, more interesting strategies
2011-05-31T04:07:04  <antimatroid1> and more interesting to watch

2011-05-31T04:13:06  <McLeopold> sir_macelon: I'm glad you agree.  I also want to prevent the massive explosion of dumb bots when the trod over a "minefield" of food.
2011-05-31T04:13:51  <McLeopold> I might still try to write a bot in haskell, but I'm not going to try to win or keep up.
2011-05-31T04:15:12  <antimatroid1> sir_macelon: how are you collecting food out of interest?
2011-05-31T04:15:29  <antimatroid1> i agree though, food collection is fairly simply, the real game is going to be with battles and macro strategies
2011-05-31T04:15:33  <aerique> will the starter bots come with extra tools for playing and visualizing locally?
2011-05-31T04:15:48  <McLeopold> amstan put together a tools pack today
2011-05-31T04:15:55  <McLeopold> it's a separate download
2011-05-31T04:15:57  <antimatroid1> not sure, it would be best to release a separate general tools package i think
2011-05-31T04:16:12  <antimatroid1> that way people know they don't need to submit everything and we don't need to package it with every starter bot
2011-05-31T04:16:13  <McLeopold> I'm still excepting to put up language specific packs as well.
2011-05-31T04:16:44  <sir_macelon> animatroid: it is rather complicated now after so many upgrades, but i could try to explain :)
2011-05-31T04:16:56  <aerique> ok, it's just so i know what to put in my starter packs readme.
2011-05-31T04:17:06  <sir_macelon> *antimatroid1* sorry for spelling ;)
2011-05-31T04:17:12  <antimatroid1> i have refined the explanation of mine pretty well, i'll start first if you like, then you can explain yours if it's different :P
2011-05-31T04:17:39  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: are you even on the beta server?
2011-05-31T04:17:41  <aerique> fine with me :)
2011-05-31T04:18:39  <sir_macelon> basically i take every food tile and assign every my ant to it
2011-05-31T04:19:02  <McLeopold> sir_macelon: did you use the java starter or re-write?
2011-05-31T04:19:07  <sir_macelon> then sort it depending on the distance
2011-05-31T04:19:31  <sir_macelon> McLeopold: i nearly rewritten the whole starter package
2011-05-31T04:19:46  <sir_macelon> i didn't like it's architecture
2011-05-31T04:19:54  <antimatroid1> i start with every location containing an ant as available in 0 turns, everything else as not available, then i iteratively do a bfs from all food squares simultaneously until i find the ant that can get within the spawnradius of a food square in the smallest number of turns (based on available data, you need to search till like currentDist < bestDist + bestLocAvailability or something) then move that ant towards the f
2011-05-31T04:19:59  <sir_macelon> i also write some junit tests to test it
2011-05-31T04:20:22  <McLeopold> sir_macelon: could you make the starter better then?
2011-05-31T04:20:54  <antimatroid1> the availability information gives you a pretty big boost on food collection ability
2011-05-31T04:20:54  <sir_macelon> i could, but i need to update some javadocs so it will be better understandeble for noobs
2011-05-31T04:21:21  <McLeopold> I'm not the best a java, so a re-write would be okay with me.
2011-05-31T04:21:29  <sir_macelon> antimatroid1: you do to much calculation for the food
2011-05-31T04:21:44  <antimatroid1> no, it's not much more expensive, and well worth it
2011-05-31T04:22:07  <antimatroid1> consider
2011-05-31T04:22:08  <antimatroid1> *..a...*
2011-05-31T04:22:08  <antimatroid1> *..a...*
2011-05-31T04:22:11  <sir_macelon> i don't make the search path until it is really necessary
2011-05-31T04:22:15  <antimatroid1> would you send both a's left? i would send one of them right
2011-05-31T04:22:20  <sir_macelon> i call it lazy path finding
2011-05-31T04:22:40  <antimatroid1> i am basically using future ant locations and future spawned ants in my calculations for collecting foo
2011-05-31T04:22:53  <antimatroid1> so i can better make use of my current ants moves
2011-05-31T04:22:57  <sir_macelon> i also use it implcitily
2011-05-31T04:23:10  <aerique> i'm not sure whether i should update to CL starter bot for the problem with game 7779, since it seems to be a game engine bug and there's an issue for it anyway (and the error message is pretty clear)
2011-05-31T04:23:24  <McLeopold> it is a bug
2011-05-31T04:23:37  <McLeopold> even if we didn't want to tell you the owner, it should still be an int
2011-05-31T04:24:02  <McLeopold> I just like the lovely error message that tells you exactly what is happening
2011-05-31T04:24:33  <aerique> me too :)
2011-05-31T04:24:46  <sir_macelon> antimatroid1: in your situation there will be four targets and for every target i assign my two ants
2011-05-31T04:25:05  <sir_macelon> then i sort the targets in the asc order
2011-05-31T04:25:18  <sir_macelon> two on the left will be on top

2011-05-31T04:25:29  <sir_macelon> then i take one of them
2011-05-31T04:25:44  <sir_macelon> and reserve my closest ant to it
2011-05-31T04:25:57  <sir_macelon> then for every other target i add two new ants
2011-05-31T04:26:08  <McLeopold> it's a traveling salesman that spawns new salesmen
2011-05-31T04:26:14  <aerique> McLeopold: would you still be interested in a little video showing you my CL workflow with using a proxy-bot?  (I'd have to make it)
2011-05-31T04:26:24  <McLeopold> very much yes !
2011-05-31T04:26:25  <sir_macelon> but with the overhead of the distance to the food
2011-05-31T04:26:42  <sir_macelon> one will be the old ant and the second one will be the new, spawned ant
2011-05-31T04:27:09  <aerique> McLeopold: okey, not sure when i will do it.  maybe when the challenge has officially started
2011-05-31T04:27:14  <sir_macelon> then againg i sort the assigned ants to targets and it turns the newly spawned ant will get that food
2011-05-31T04:27:14  <McLeopold> aerique: it would bring others into making cl bots, especially since mega1 won.
2011-05-31T04:27:37  <antimatroid1> do you track when these future targets will be available?
2011-05-31T04:27:46  <antimatroid1> otherwise your calculations might not work as effectively
2011-05-31T04:27:54  <sir_macelon> i just add a delay in turns
2011-05-31T04:28:27  <sir_macelon> in your example i assume spawnradius2=1
2011-05-31T04:28:51  <sir_macelon> then after first iteration i add to the three remaining tagets two ants
2011-05-31T04:29:11  <antimatroid1> has anyone had any ideas for battles?
2011-05-31T04:29:11  <sir_macelon> with turn delay 2
2011-05-31T04:29:25  <antimatroid1> i have pretty much worked out my food collection, i have almost no idea for battles
2011-05-31T04:30:00  <sir_macelon> then it is just a matter of sorting with pereference to the ants with higher delay
2011-05-31T04:30:14  <antimatroid1> i've pretty much given up on the idea of game trees for battles, too many ants
2011-05-31T04:30:18  <antimatroid1> too many branches
2011-05-31T04:30:25  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I have a great idea for battles that involves learning...
2011-05-31T04:30:32  <sir_macelon> i think i already developed a quite strong battle mechanism, that is quick and effective
2011-05-31T04:30:51  <sir_macelon> but i will keep it secret :)

2011-05-31T13:12:06  <UncleVasya> I improved tile type a little:   type tile = [ `Water | `Land | `Food | `Ant | `Dead | `Unseen |`Busy];;  As you see, added `Busy
2011-05-31T13:13:17  <UncleVasya> Busy means that someone of my ants already going there.
2011-05-31T13:14:01  <UncleVasya> I added it to tile_of_int and int_of_tile functions (by number 500)

2011-05-31T15:03:42  <mcstar> i have a better estimate(the prev. value i gave doesnt include the real array accesses)
2011-05-31T15:04:24  <mcstar> for a 9072 sized map it takes 0.43 seconds

2011-05-31T15:05:53  <mcstar> and do you precompute the indices to be accessed, or by an inequality on-the-fly?
2011-05-31T15:05:57  <mcstar> oh
2011-05-31T15:06:06  <mcstar> so you dont have an estimate?:
2011-05-31T15:06:08  <McLeopold> I actually haven't tried to write a real bot yet.
2011-05-31T15:06:14  <McLeopold> No, not really.
2011-05-31T15:06:21  <mcstar> im asking about the engine
2011-05-31T15:06:31  <mcstar> the bot doesnt need to do this
2011-05-31T15:06:36  <McLeopold> sigh did the benchmarks on that
2011-05-31T15:06:52  <McLeopold> and wrote the faster code
2011-05-31T15:07:06  <mcstar> ok ill try him
2011-05-31T15:07:58  <janzert> mcstar: don't know if it will help you find what you want, but there is a script in the util directory under ants that compares various vision methods
2011-05-31T15:08:01  <mcstar> but does the engine occupy the full cpu btw?
2011-05-31T15:08:26  <McLeopold> mcstar: not while the bots are doing moves
2011-05-31T15:08:51  <McLeopold> the timing doesn't start until the engine waits for bot input, and we do a sleep to ensure we don't take time away from bots
2011-05-31T15:09:07  <mcstar> janzert: i wasnt going to look at the code, its easier to ask, and i wouldnt really benefit from seeing that code, its more like curiosity

2011-05-31T15:11:32  <mcstar> for the moment this seems fast to me

2011-05-31T15:43:23  <janzert> he did say that, but then when I went to try it I don't see it being fixed and he couldn't find it as fixed eitehr
2011-05-31T15:43:25  <janzert> either
2011-05-31T15:43:38  <janzert> so not sure how it worked for him the one time
2011-05-31T15:44:32  <janzert> oh, I do remember now what happened
2011-05-31T15:44:44  <janzert> he only installed GHC not the full haskell-platform
2011-05-31T15:45:00  <janzert> and it's the platform package that is broken

2011-05-31T15:45:39  <janzert> there was some debate whether just having ghc and not the platform would be good enough for the contest
2011-05-31T15:45:53  <janzert> I never heard whether that was true or not
2011-05-31T15:47:07  <hjax> contestbot: later tell amstan I had school today, im starting testing now, ill make an issue for easier testing
2011-05-31T15:47:07  <contestbot> hjax: Ready to serve.
2011-05-31T15:47:12  <mcstar> 11.29 ms for me the fastest
2011-05-31T15:47:35  <McLeopold> janzert: can we get by with just ghc?
2011-05-31T15:48:29  <janzert> that's what I don't know
2011-05-31T15:48:49  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: ping
2011-05-31T15:48:50  <janzert> I assume jmcarthur is best to answer that
2011-05-31T15:48:56  <janzert> :)
2011-05-31T15:50:26  <mcstar> janzert: what kind of cpu u got?
2011-05-31T15:51:26  <janzert> i5 750
2011-05-31T15:51:46  <berak> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=8468 // what happened to the food spawning ?
2011-05-31T15:51:57  <janzert> although those timings above were also run inside a vm so maybe slower than expected from the cpu I have
2011-05-31T15:52:11  <mcstar> ok, nice one, i ride an old amd x2
2011-05-31T15:53:46  <mcstar> berak: for one it became symmetric it seems which isnt half bad
2011-05-31T15:56:25  <berak> i'd even agree on sym vs asym, but most of the time, there's neither food, or opponents visible to each player in this game
2011-05-31T15:57:40  <mcstar> there was talk that the option specified for spawing food controlled the initial amount by ANTs, it was misunderstood before, and now its correctly lower, also, migh be too low, nevertheless correct me if im wrong
2011-05-31T15:58:25  <jmcarthur> McLeopold, janzert: if you can get ghc and cabal-install to work, then you can use cabal-install to install the rest of the platform. it requires building the libraries from source, though. most of them don't take too long, as long as you avoid the opengl stuff
2011-05-31T15:58:42  <jmcarthur> cabal-install handles the downloading and building. it's like a package manager for haskell stuff
2011-05-31T16:01:03  <hjax> McLeopold you here?

2011-05-31T19:42:38  <amstan> all the scripts i have to exec i have to type python in front

2011-05-31T20:38:43  <McLeopold> I thought the same thing and almost wrote something until *I* facepalmed :)
2011-05-31T20:38:54  <amstan> janzert: k, so what state is the worker installer in now? can i install? or is there some quick commits you have to do?
2011-05-31T20:39:24  <McLeopold> the goal is 4 gpm...
2011-05-31T20:39:30  <janzert> the automatic installation is humming along fine at the moment, I do know it will have a problem at the end though
2011-05-31T20:39:33  <McLeopold> we've got 3 workers running right now
2011-05-31T20:39:43  <amstan> McLeopold: we do?
2011-05-31T20:39:48  <McLeopold> but no jails
2011-05-31T20:39:59  <janzert> I still need to rewrite the worker startup script
2011-05-31T20:40:02  <amstan> McLeopold: is there a way to get separate worker info in here? http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/server_stats.php
2011-05-31T20:40:07  <amstan> the worker table is not what it used to be
2011-05-31T20:40:24  <McLeopold> it's not that different
2011-05-31T20:40:35  <amstan> janzert: well.. i can give you a shell account to my htpc and you can try there if you want
2011-05-31T20:40:50  <McLeopold> I'm not familiar with what it was
2011-05-31T20:40:54  <janzert> McLeopold: we need to be able to get individual worker information at least
2011-05-31T20:40:59  <amstan> McLeopold: i had an error on every query for that table, i just decided to remove them then
2011-05-31T20:41:09  <janzert> i.e. per worker games and errors per minute
2011-05-31T20:41:20  <McLeopold> I'll look at the queries in the history
2011-05-31T20:41:39  <janzert> we use that information to monitor the health of a worker to see if it needs a reboot

2011-05-31T20:43:08  <amstan> McLeopold: oh yes, what do you think? http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/using_the_tools.php
2011-05-31T20:43:38  <janzert> actually the monitor script used api_worker_query.php to get the information
2011-05-31T20:43:40  <amstan> i removed stuff from the old one, some parts seemed too weird for older programmers
2011-05-31T20:43:56  <janzert> so having it on the human readable page isn't required I suppose but probably still nice
2011-05-31T20:44:07  <amstan> include?
2011-05-31T20:44:19  <McLeopold> so, api_worker_query is probably broken then?
2011-05-31T20:44:46  <janzert> most likely since the database structure has changed so much
2011-05-31T20:45:00  <McLeopold> amstan: it's a good start, but needs a re-write
2011-05-31T20:45:09  <McLeopold> IMHO
2011-05-31T20:45:23  <amstan> i'm not a good writer
2011-05-31T20:46:04  <McLeopold> basically, I'd do a how-to with lists and examples rather than an essay in paragraph form
2011-05-31T20:46:45  <amstan> well, here's my list: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/128

2011-05-31T20:54:07  <janzert> and it died at the non-existent worker start script :/

2011-05-31T21:02:51  <amstan> janzert: do you have anything in mind for the api worker setup php page?
2011-05-31T21:03:01  <amstan> janzert: is it supposed to contain some cool convenience methods?
2011-05-31T21:03:13  <amstan> s/methods/commands/
2011-05-31T21:03:40  <janzert> basically it feeds the worker an initilization script
2011-05-31T21:03:47  <janzert> it should be all set at this point
2011-05-31T21:03:53  <amstan> do we have such a script?

2011-05-31T21:04:37  <amstan> in setup/?
2011-05-31T21:04:51  <janzert> I ended up moving it to the website
2011-05-31T21:05:12  <janzert> kind of icky but that's where we need it from
2011-05-31T21:05:16  <amstan> ln -s?
2011-05-31T21:05:27  <janzert> there's really no need for it in setup
2011-05-31T21:05:41  <amstan> if i git clone, i'd want that
2011-05-31T21:05:44  <janzert> it's only for automated installs
2011-05-31T21:05:58  <amstan> wouldn't git pull be useful for updating automated installs?
2011-05-31T21:05:58  <janzert> nah, I doubt it

2011-05-31T21:25:36  <hjax> amstan, its not behaving like a starter bot, its intelligent and about to take my bot down on the leaderboards
2011-05-31T21:26:19  <amstan> i'm not sure what antimatroid's plan is, he didn't really make it clear that they must follow a strategy

2011-05-31T21:27:12  <hjax> gostarterbot is neither
2011-05-31T21:27:36  <hjax> amstan, scalastarterbot froze the worker

2011-05-31T21:27:47  <amstan> how?
2011-05-31T21:28:09  <hjax> its happened with coffeescript before
2011-05-31T21:28:26  <amstan> what do you mean worker? it seems to work just fine still
2011-05-31T21:28:30  <hjax> this is the first scala bot, and the worker cant compile it
2011-05-31T21:28:59  <amstan> so.. it can't compile? or did it crash the whole worker(as in there's no more games being played on the server)
2011-05-31T21:29:23  <hjax> i cant tell yet
2011-05-31T21:29:37  <amstan> why did you say "froze the worker"?
2011-05-31T21:30:13  <hjax> hmmm either the worker is hanging or crashed
2011-05-31T21:30:44  <amstan> it's executing java bots..
2011-05-31T21:30:46  <amstan> doing just fine
2011-05-31T21:30:53  <amstan> i have no idea what you mean by that
2011-05-31T21:31:02  <hjax> really? scalabot is still on compiling and running tests
2011-05-31T21:31:17  <hjax> no waiting to compile
2011-05-31T21:31:42  <amstan> it'll probably play a game in between
2011-05-31T21:32:14  <hjax> it shouldnt update that status until its actually started :/

2011-05-31T22:20:33  <amstan> oshit..
2011-05-31T22:20:51  <amstan> McLeopold: i did a mistake
2011-05-31T22:21:07  <amstan> McLeopold: sudo rm -Rf /srv/chroot on the server
2011-05-31T22:21:13  <amstan> McLeopold: i think i'll have to reinstall the worker
2011-05-31T22:21:26  <amstan> McLeopold: i tought it was my local machine, they have the same hostname
2011-05-31T22:21:31  <McLeopold> smiley1983: the only downside is if you fill up your 1024 byte quota, you may not see a good error if you do crash
2011-05-31T22:21:44  <McLeopold> amstan: we're not using jails anyway
2011-05-31T22:21:49  <amstan> oh!
2011-05-31T22:21:52  <amstan> that's right
2011-05-31T22:21:55  <amstan> omg! i am relieved
2011-05-31T22:22:12  * amstan continues to rm -rf
2011-05-31T22:22:27  <McLeopold> It would be nice if *nix had a command line trash that you could recover from
2011-05-31T22:22:52  <McLeopold> I'm sure someone has written an alias for it at some point
2011-05-31T22:23:24  <smiley1983> McLeopold: I'm glad to hear that there's a limit, and it wasn't just filling up the server's whole drive with my garbage :)
2011-05-31T22:23:38  <McLeopold> no, just my debug console :)
2011-05-31T22:23:39  <amstan> McLeopold: you could easily do it by mving to .trash
2011-05-31T22:23:48  <amstan> McLeopold: it takes less time that mv as well
2011-05-31T22:24:00  <jbroman> amstan: There are edge cases here.
2011-05-31T22:24:15  <amstan> jbroman: yes
2011-05-31T22:24:20  <amstan> jbroman: you're probably lolling at me right now
2011-05-31T22:24:20  <jbroman> amstan: For example, the case where I have write access to a directory but cannot read the file. I may delete it, but I would not be able to move it to another filesystem.
2011-05-31T22:24:41  <amstan> if i were to write a wrapper i would mv it to the same fs
2011-05-31T22:24:49  <amstan> unless it's a flash drive
2011-05-31T22:25:26  <jbroman> I'm not even sure whether you could mv it to the same filesystem if it's owned by somebody edge and is 700 or similar. Probably not.
2011-05-31T22:25:36  <jbroman> Many GUI file managers do provide Windows/Mac-like Trash. But especially for the command-line, it's weird when you try to define certain odd situations.
2011-05-31T22:26:00  <jbroman> Another solution is snapshots (à la ZFS).
2011-05-31T22:26:18  <amstan> yeah, but doesn't that mean more overhead when doing things?
2011-05-31T22:26:33  <jbroman> amstan: ZFS snapshots are, from what I understand, rather low in overhead.
2011-05-31T22:27:00  <jbroman> (Copy-on-write etc)
2011-05-31T22:27:19  <amstan> decent, would you use it to replace ext4?
2011-05-31T22:27:42  <jbroman> I don't think it's stable on Linux. I hear btrfs is nice in its own right, but I haven't even looked that closely at what's new in ext4.
2011-05-31T22:27:54  <jbroman> Frankly, most of my important stuff is code which sits in source control anyways. :P

2011-05-31T22:43:50  <amstan> McLeopold: so.. how much do you think we have left till launch?
2011-05-31T22:43:55  <amstan> i think it's time we get jeff
2011-05-31T22:45:28  <McLeopold> amstan: There's quite a few issues with displaying data on the website, but nobody has noticed or opened issues.
2011-05-31T22:45:41  <McLeopold> That said, we could probably launch real soon.
2011-05-31T22:45:51  <amstan> yeah, let me write an email
2011-05-31T22:46:15  <McLeopold> Do we have server to launch on?

2011-05-31T22:52:36  <amstan> janzert: yay
2011-05-31T22:54:14  <janzert> anytime you want the code that is installed on workers to be updated just run setup/create_worker_archive.py again
2011-05-31T22:54:35  <janzert> and this way we can exactly control when and what that is
2011-05-31T22:55:02  <janzert> it creates it from the local server repo of course
2011-05-31T22:55:55  <amstan> once you run create_worker_archive, does it update the workers or something?
2011-05-31T22:56:24  <janzert> no, it updates the tar ball that worker_init pulls from
2011-05-31T22:56:42  <janzert> worker_init is only ever used once for the initial setup of a worker
2011-05-31T22:56:59  <janzert> and really only for automated worker installs on ec2

2011-05-31T23:07:52  <amstan> shouldn't that be defined?
2011-05-31T23:08:04  <janzert> where?
2011-05-31T23:08:13  <janzert> most places it's options
2011-05-31T23:08:13  <amstan> everywhere in worker_setup
2011-05-31T23:08:15  <amstan> as a global
2011-05-31T23:08:18  <janzert> no
2011-05-31T23:08:24  <amstan> why is it an argument?
2011-05-31T23:08:32  <janzert> it is passed into functions as a paramater
2011-05-31T23:08:52  <amstan> if i want to pass it to install_dmd i have to pass it to install_all_languages as well
2011-05-31T23:08:58  <janzert> because globals are bad? :)
2011-05-31T23:09:10  <janzert> yep, generally
2011-05-31T23:10:32  <amstan> janzert: can i just do _, arch = get_ubuntu_release_info() in there?
2011-05-31T23:10:38  <amstan> instead of using opts?
2011-05-31T23:11:07  <janzert> did get_ubuntu_release_info even work inside a chroot?

2011-05-31T23:12:11  <McLeopold> did we have 5 workers last contest?
2011-05-31T23:12:13  * janzert would really rather not paramaterize everything for architecture actually
2011-05-31T23:12:26  <janzert> McLeopold: 3 or 4 most of the time
2011-05-31T23:12:29  <amstan> janzert: otherwise the worker will always crash on my system
2011-05-31T23:12:37  <amstan> because i have 32 bit

2011-05-31T23:13:16  <janzert> only making it work on the setup we're using :/
2011-05-31T23:13:23  <janzert> I don't have a good solution
2011-05-31T23:13:45  <amstan> yes, but if it doesn't work on 32(and that's the only reason why) i cannot test
2011-05-31T23:14:02  <amstan> are you ok with me not participating in the multiple worker+sandbox tests?
2011-05-31T23:15:54  <janzert> I won't stand in the way of making it architecture portable, I just don't really like the extra additions we are having to add for it

2011-05-31T23:33:00  <McLeopold> is it in the repo?
2011-05-31T23:33:05  <amstan> yes
2011-05-31T23:33:14  <amstan> and my tools makefile includes it in the zip
2011-05-31T23:33:16  <McLeopold> no, that is just a temp dir, it shouldn't have been commited
2011-05-31T23:33:28  <McLeopold> probably my fault
2011-05-31T23:33:29  <amstan> what about play_one_game.sh?
2011-05-31T23:33:32  <amstan> --log_dir game_logs
2011-05-31T23:33:38  <amstan> will it fail if the dir doesn't exist?
2011-05-31T23:33:41  <McLeopold> playgame should create it
2011-05-31T23:33:44  <amstan> k
2011-05-31T23:34:12  <McLeopold> playgame, line 234
2011-05-31T23:34:27  <amstan> nvm, it's gitignored
2011-05-31T23:34:34  <amstan> i guess i have to clean it in my makefile
2011-05-31T23:34:52  <amstan> McLeopold: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip
2011-05-31T23:34:58  <amstan> see what's extra in there
2011-05-31T23:35:05  <amstan> i know the visualiser stuff is extra
2011-05-31T23:35:12  <amstan> but i have to run ant to clean it
2011-05-31T23:35:17  <amstan> and ant doesn't want to run on that server
2011-05-31T23:36:07  <McLeopold> the .gitignore files are extra
2011-05-31T23:36:45  <McLeopold> website-source looks like extra
2011-05-31T23:37:05  <McLeopold> don't include compiled files like *.pyc
2011-05-31T23:37:29  <McLeopold> but I would include jar files
2011-05-31T23:37:52  <amstan> do you have a way to do this cleanly?
2011-05-31T23:37:59  <amstan> maybe another git checkout?
2011-05-31T23:38:06  <McLeopold> no, that's what your doing?
2011-05-31T23:38:11  <amstan> no
2011-05-31T23:38:14  <amstan> i'm cping
2011-05-31T23:38:26  <amstan> but it feels really dirty
2011-05-31T23:38:28  <McLeopold> I thought you were writting a makefiles?
2011-05-31T23:38:46  <amstan> yes: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/tools/Makefile
2011-05-31T23:40:01  <McLeopold> I think we should leave out the asymmetric map get
2011-05-31T23:40:03  <McLeopold> gen
2011-05-31T23:40:50  <amstan> why do we even have that?
2011-05-31T23:40:58  <amstan> just git rm it
2011-05-31T23:41:27  <McLeopold> it's okay to leave code in the repo, just the tools download should be really clean
2011-05-31T23:41:41  <amstan> tools will get everything from ants/ right now
2011-05-31T23:41:45  <amstan> except the starter_packages
2011-05-31T23:41:51  <amstan> so we might as well clean it
2011-05-31T23:42:24  <McLeopold> I'm not sure about the stuff in util.  Probably leave it out.
2011-05-31T23:43:26  <McLeopold> amstan: how would a git checkout work?
2011-05-31T23:43:35  <McLeopold> like a branch with only what we want?
2011-05-31T23:43:59  <amstan> we could do that, a tools branch
2011-05-31T23:44:03  <amstan> and merge regularly
2011-05-31T23:44:15  <McLeopold> so, it could pull only what we want?
2011-05-31T23:44:30  <amstan> i was just thinking pulling the repo again in a subfolder then only keeping the ants folder
2011-05-31T23:44:35  <amstan> that way everything is clean
2011-05-31T23:44:45  <amstan> no pyc files, log files or compiled visualizer
2011-05-31T23:45:12  <McLeopold> if you make a branch, I can update it, that might be better
2011-05-31T23:45:36  <amstan> you can update epsilon fine as well
2011-05-31T23:46:09  <McLeopold> this isn't going to be a one-to-one pull of a repo, and it shouldn't be
2011-05-31T23:46:34  <McLeopold> let's just stick with the makefile and I can modify it where needed
2011-05-31T23:47:09  <amstan> yes, i'm just saying, to clone the repo instead of using rsync to copy ants
2011-05-31T23:47:18  <amstan> that way anything in gitignore actually gets ignored
