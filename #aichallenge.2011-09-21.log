2011-09-21T05:48:45  <delt0r_> my pc clock drifts about 15min in just 22 days
2011-09-21T05:49:35  <delt0r_> eashoka: so what it a 2 player game or 4 or what?
2011-09-21T05:49:39  <delt0r_> was it
2011-09-21T05:51:15  <eashoka> delt0r : a 5 player game
2011-09-21T05:51:35  <delt0r_> right, this is sort of where True Skill can get a bit funny
2011-09-21T05:52:05  <delt0r_> it takes the orginal ranks and really only considers "ranked" draws...
2011-09-21T05:52:16  <eashoka> u could see in this profile. see the top game. winner has lost points! http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=188
2011-09-21T05:53:47  <delt0r_> there are not skill scores going down on that page
2011-09-21T05:53:51  <delt0r_> no skill
2011-09-21T05:54:33  <eashoka> sorry, it has become the second game from top now.
2011-09-21T05:55:06  <eashoka> winner has lost 0.02 skill points
2011-09-21T05:55:24  <delt0r_> well it shows a -
2011-09-21T05:56:01  <eashoka> yea it shows arrows only when the gain/loss is greater that 0.1 or something
2011-09-21T05:56:04  <delt0r_> meaning the same skill... since there have quite a few resets, my guess 70.03 was not really the start score perhaps
2011-09-21T05:56:15  <delt0r_> perhaps there is a reason for that
2011-09-21T05:56:32  <delt0r_> esp if sigma is like 1 or something
2011-09-21T05:59:42  <eashoka> delt0r : it is actually a bit larger problem that 0.02, because actually the winner should have gained something. (even though a small fraction of a point). so that actual error has to be a larger one (for example : showing -0.02 in place of a +0.08 is actually a error of 0.10)
2011-09-21T06:01:03  <delt0r_> eashoka: that is not correct... if they play a buch of people with a lot less skill than there own, then a win should not increase there skill
2011-09-21T06:01:16  <delt0r_> as is expected from the model
2011-09-21T06:01:49  <delt0r_> because we have a iterative approximate solver (only way to make it tracktable) you can "bleed" a little skill in this case
2011-09-21T06:01:59  <delt0r_> round of error if you like
2011-09-21T06:02:03  <delt0r_> off
2011-09-21T06:02:16  <delt0r_> I really don't see anything unexpected sorry.
2011-09-21T06:02:49  <delt0r_> also i don't think .02 will ever matter in the long run, since the *sigma* will show the spread
2011-09-21T06:03:13  <eashoka> delt0r : ah ok. so u think it's not a defect? alright then, I'm not familiar enough in trueskill to argue u in this :-) anyway, I have seen few other instances like that previously in many other profiles and have reported.
2011-09-21T06:03:34  <delt0r_> if its like .1 i would worry.
2011-09-21T06:03:46  <eashoka> delt0r : in ELO ratings however, one never loose rating points after winning with a lower rank player.
2011-09-21T06:03:58  <delt0r_> but at .02 when clearly the skill levels are very different... i am not surprised
2011-09-21T06:04:08  <delt0r_> and here you would too
2011-09-21T06:04:25  <delt0r_> a losse would mean loosing a lot of skill
2011-09-21T06:04:40  <delt0r_> hence why you try and match similar skilled folks
2011-09-21T06:04:58  <delt0r_> because a really good player has nothing to gain by playing low skill players
2011-09-21T06:10:12  <eashoka> delt0r : yea agreed. (however, ideal should be an unaltered skill level after winning with a weaker player) that brings me to the second qsn. currently in the tournament, it doesn't look like there is an attempt to match similar skilled folks. may be this is just for some testing purpose and not the final matching algorithm ? :-)

2011-09-21T06:16:49  <delt0r_> so in the last 24 hours or so there are some pretty bad match ups

2011-09-21T06:17:18  <delt0r_> Its is also still getting worked on
2011-09-21T06:17:55  <delt0r_> in the true skills system the match quality is a measure of how likely a draw is btw

2011-09-21T06:19:20  <delt0r_> also not true skills is bayesian  and that its is approximate... but i think its a good set of trade offs.
2011-09-21T06:19:27  <delt0r_> s/not/note
2011-09-21T06:19:41  <delt0r_> what is with me in the last few days... I can't type
2011-09-21T06:21:20  <eashoka> delt0r : ah u r way better than me in terms of typos :-)  interesting. so the skill calculation and match pairings goes very much hand in hand in true skill ?
2011-09-21T06:23:38  <eashoka> delt0r : In ELO based systems they mostly use swiss system for pairing but generally the pairing logic is important only to decide on a tournament winner and not the rating level
2011-09-21T06:31:52  <delt0r_> true skill and ELO are related. true skill is kind of ELO on steroids. They both need a lot of games played and in our case we have n player games. Draws are kinda stuck on the end of both systems more or less
2011-09-21T06:32:51  <delt0r_> ass for optimal matches ... i don't even think that is known for sure, but it has been asserted that similar is better since you get more information about "local rank"
2011-09-21T06:32:59  <delt0r_> ass->as
2011-09-21T06:33:32  <delt0r_> and don't forget each player gets a sigma --while in elo is the same for everyone... IIRC
2011-09-21T06:34:06  <delt0r_> Both use approximations pretty heavily to make the problem tractable

2011-09-21T06:36:25  <delt0r_> the true distribution will depend on your rank, and will be closer to some sort of extreme distribution (Weibul) when you are last/first

2011-09-21T06:37:48  <sir_macelon> hi, I have created a snippet for an algo proposal as in https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/247#issuecomment-2019057
2011-09-21T06:38:06  <sir_macelon> https://gist.github.com/1231764 - what do you think of it?
2011-09-21T06:44:49  <delt0r_> what the point sir_macelon
2011-09-21T06:51:03  <bhasker> hi delt0r
2011-09-21T07:05:54  <sir_macelon> delt0r_: to level the rankings for close scores with a parametrizable factor
2011-09-21T07:06:10  <delt0r_> but why?
2011-09-21T07:06:42  <sir_macelon> have you read the issue #247?
2011-09-21T07:10:21  <sir_macelon> the problem is bots don't get any information about scores during the game, so it is impossible to plan game strategy for that
2011-09-21T07:12:11  <sir_macelon> and since score determines final ranks, it is rather unfair if a bot turns out to lose bacuse it didn't know it was behind in score
2011-09-21T07:12:27  <sir_macelon> example: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=196413

2011-09-21T07:21:32  <sir_macelon> delt0r_: what do you mean by that? what is your version?
2011-09-21T07:21:39  <delt0r_> the bot does not have global information. Therefore it can't know if its wining... unless perhaps it takes over the whole map. So the bot must take that into account
2011-09-21T07:22:02  <delt0r_> my version is that the rules are the same for everyone and everybot, so it is fair
2011-09-21T07:22:14  <delt0r_> fair does not mean easy
2011-09-21T07:24:23  <eashoka> sir_macelon, delt0r : I think I'm also talking about the same issue but in a different view. In the game sir_macelon provided, the real reason for the anomoly is that scoring algorithm does not acknowledge who the victor is (in normal battles this is mostly the party which has larger remaining force at the end of the battle). We don;t take remaining ants into the equation.

2011-09-21T07:24:48  <sir_macelon> delt0r_:  well maybe indeed fair is not the right word here, but maybe incosistent
2011-09-21T07:24:55  <eashoka> by a simple improvments to the scoring algorithm we can rectify that and still make sure the better bots in battle is rewarded.

2011-09-21T07:27:26  <sir_macelon> delt0r_: I also think that the bot should have some kind of information about the current rank during the game to be able to react on that
2011-09-21T07:28:27  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-21T07:28:30  <eashoka> issue 247 comments have all the explanations but in short : score = (kills_made - ants_lost) * weight + remaining_ants_at_the_end   Note that there is no bonus for spawning!
2011-09-21T07:29:40  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I like your idea for the scoring
2011-09-21T07:29:51  <sir_macelon> but you don't weight the remaining ants?
2011-09-21T07:30:27  <eashoka> first weight can control the second. consider its a weight of 1
2011-09-21T07:30:48  <sir_macelon> shouldn't this weight also be adjustable?
2011-09-21T07:31:27  <eashoka> if we increase the first wight then that means more prominance to battles and less for remaining ants. if we lower the first weight beyone 1, that will increase the remaning ants significance
2011-09-21T07:32:11  <eashoka> so mathematically, just one weight is enough, but yea we could have too, that will make it more readable as well.
2011-09-21T07:32:20  <eashoka> too -> two
2011-09-21T07:32:20  <sir_macelon> I also have another idea: the bot would recieve a new line of input from the engine with its current rank, then it would know he is behind eventhough it sees it has more ants in game
2011-09-21T07:34:04  <eashoka> sir_macelon : the very idea why a new input is needed is because bots can't calculate for themselves the score isn't it ? that's because score is less natural right now. (no acknowledgement for the overall battle winner with the larger army)
2011-09-21T07:35:09  <eashoka> if we solve that prob, then bots may not need a new input. it can just go about killing, spawning and defending. increasing the relative strength of its army and everything will turn out alright.
2011-09-21T07:35:23  <sir_macelon> eashoka: exactly, the idea behind is that the bot MUST actually know if it is winning or loosing at any point in the game, to be able to react on that
2011-09-21T07:35:46  <sir_macelon> that was possible in every previous contest, why now it is not?
2011-09-21T07:36:45  <sir_macelon> how scoring is done is rather a background topic as it is just an indirect solution

2011-09-21T07:37:37  <eashoka> like delt0r mentioned, if the bot can see the map he can find out enemy strength and his own. if the scoring is natural then bots can reasonably calculate their position isn't it ?
2011-09-21T07:37:57  <sir_macelon> what I also find weird from the engine pov that bot doesn't get precise information about movement of enemy ants

2011-09-21T07:39:08  <sir_macelon> eashoka: the problem is that how would you check if your scoring is natural?
2011-09-21T07:39:09  *** delt0r_ <delt0r_!~bob@178-190-66-240.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-21T07:39:57  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I don't think so, but as I expressed there should a way for the bot to know if it is winning or not
2011-09-21T07:40:16  <eashoka> I meant natural in the sense that it adhers to normal battle resolutions. (larger army at the end of the battle doesn't lose it :-) )
2011-09-21T07:41:46  <sir_macelon> but how this scoring theme would deal with bots avoiding fight and gathering ants, I can imagine there can be some odd situations at game end
2011-09-21T07:42:04  <eashoka> I think we both agree on the exact problem (scenarios like in the game you provided should not happen) we just proposing 2 different solution to it right ? and there could be other solutions as well (such as increasing the turn limit or set it dynamically adjusted))
2011-09-21T07:42:49  <sir_macelon> I don't have anything against having both solutions
2011-09-21T07:42:54  <eashoka> sir_mac : in the improvement I suggested. we can increase the battle weight and then (kills - losses) will have more significant say over the final result.
2011-09-21T07:44:12  <sir_macelon> but then suppose you have a very aggressive bot, who fights everyone has many kills, but eventually is eliminated later, he could have so big score, keeping him as a leader till the game ends
2011-09-21T07:44:21  <sir_macelon> how the scoring would deal with it?
2011-09-21T07:45:44  <eashoka> both those situation you mentioned will be handled by finding the proper value for the weight. we may need to run the scoring algo against current data to seehow it behaves and experiment with different wegihts
2011-09-21T07:46:08  <eashoka> even now, the system depends on a weight, (2 bonus points for a kill and 1 for a spawn)
2011-09-21T07:46:43  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I believe we won't find an ideal weight, because it may turn out every weight would have a flawed scenario
2011-09-21T07:46:47  <eashoka> any formula will depend on correct values for the weights
2011-09-21T07:47:33  <eashoka> sir_macelon : true. anamoloies will happen in any case. all we can do is to minimise them
2011-09-21T07:48:03  <sir_macelon> I think much easier would be just to let to know the bot if it is winning or not, then the scoring system doesn't matter really
2011-09-21T07:48:52  <eashoka> sir_macelon : you have a point. what needs to be passed is the score in that case, not the rank.
2011-09-21T07:49:03  <eashoka> as the score is also quantitative
2011-09-21T07:49:26  <sir_macelon> not necessarilly, because the bot shouldn't know the score of other bots
2011-09-21T07:49:49  <sir_macelon> even it shouldn't know what is its current rank
2011-09-21T07:50:00  <sir_macelon> just to know if it is on the first place or not, that would be enough
2011-09-21T07:50:17  <sir_macelon> without exposing too much information to it about the game progress
2011-09-21T07:51:31  <eashoka> if ur objective to be achieved, I think scores of all bots should be provided to it in every turn (which is not necessarily a bad thing) one problem I have with that is the point delt0r raised. bots should be made out to find info.
2011-09-21T07:52:19  <eashoka> one can argue that by winning the control of the entire map, one can see all remaining enemy, one knows how many of it's ants got lost and how many killed etc....
2011-09-21T07:52:58  <sir_macelon> well indeed you can find out eventually the whole map, if you explore it totally, how many opponents there are and how many ants do they have, but you will never know their score
2011-09-21T07:53:30  <eashoka> I have nothing against your solution it's good. wish there is a way for a bot to fully calculate all by itself........
2011-09-21T07:53:39  <antimatroid> some opponents may get eliminated before you ever see them as well
2011-09-21T07:53:40  <sir_macelon> and if you got to know all the scores, then you would get to know the number of players, which is supposed not to be known from the start
2011-09-21T07:53:40  <antimatroid> etc.
2011-09-21T07:54:20  <sir_macelon> eashoka: there fog of war should be removed if you would like to know everything
2011-09-21T07:54:28  <sir_macelon> antimatroid: you have a point
2011-09-21T07:54:45  <eashoka> but I like for of war :-)
2011-09-21T07:54:56  <eashoka> ok, how about this :
2011-09-21T07:55:23  <sir_macelon> basically the bot shouldn't get a free info about player count on the map as it would enable it to easier calculate the map symmetry
2011-09-21T07:56:27  <eashoka> yes.

2011-09-21T08:00:00  <sir_macelon> the number of those scores would tell the bot how many players there are in the game
2011-09-21T08:00:17  <sir_macelon> and this kind of info the engine is trying to hide
2011-09-21T08:00:50  <sir_macelon> I believe you know why, don't you?
2011-09-21T08:00:57  <eashoka> yea, I arrived at that since you initially suggested bots should be provided their ranks
2011-09-21T08:01:19  <eashoka> but I agree now with your later comment....
2011-09-21T08:01:39  <eashoka> only the 1st or not should be provide. so only a boolean value. true or false.
2011-09-21T08:01:54  <eashoka> that sounds good.
2011-09-21T08:02:34  <sir_macelon> eashoka: exactly, that was an enahncement for initial idea :)
2011-09-21T08:02:47  <eashoka> now we are on same page. :-)
2011-09-21T08:03:30  <sir_macelon> so to summarize the changes I would like to see in the engine in terms of input provided: 1) one line with info winning/loosing; 2) additional info about direction of movement of enemy ants
2011-09-21T08:03:44  <sir_macelon> eashoka: glad to see that :)
2011-09-21T08:04:04  <eashoka> I thought with 'providing the rank' we would eventually end up with something like providing scores of all bots :-) phew!
2011-09-21T08:04:41  <eashoka> ok with 1)
2011-09-21T08:04:59  <eashoka> why 2) ? that goes against the spirit of fog of war isn't it ?
2011-09-21T08:05:00  <sir_macelon> eashoka: well even with the rank provided you won't get the full info
2011-09-21T08:05:23  <sir_macelon> eashoka: why is that?
2011-09-21T08:05:37  <eashoka> but rank will tell how many players are there and the score is just more quantifying info on rank. they are basically same.
2011-09-21T08:06:16  <sir_macelon> eashoka: it only will tell you there are at least that many players as your current rank, but you don't know more
2011-09-21T08:07:00  <sir_macelon> for example: you are now third, doesn't mean it is a 3 player game
2011-09-21T08:07:32  <eashoka> if I were given as rank 3 then i AT LEAST know it is not a 2 player game, which will drastically change my approach
2011-09-21T08:08:07  <sir_macelon> eashoka: that's why I eventually proposed the boolean value
2011-09-21T08:08:34  <sir_macelon> but it was at least better than providing every score
2011-09-21T08:09:03  <eashoka> yea thats why I eventually liked that. :-)
2011-09-21T08:09:51  <sir_macelon> great :)
2011-09-21T08:10:30  <sir_macelon> about 2) currently it is a bit hard to determine if the enemy ant is not moving if it has adjacent friendly ants
2011-09-21T08:11:02  <sir_macelon> you won't get to know anything more than what it in your LOS
2011-09-21T08:11:13  <sir_macelon> *what is in
2011-09-21T08:12:12  <sir_macelon> or it is hard to keep track of the enemy movement in your LOS
2011-09-21T08:13:25  <sir_macelon> you need to find out from which square the ant has come and sometimes it is not too easy
2011-09-21T08:13:39  <sir_macelon> if you would like to chase a particular ant

2011-09-21T08:27:09  <delt0r> i do not want bots to know how many ants there are or its rank
2011-09-21T08:27:41  <delt0r> bots should try and maximize its score on what it does know.
2011-09-21T08:29:47  <antimatroid> the dimensions give you some information about the number of players

2011-09-21T08:30:19  <antimatroid> we could fix dimensions to maximise the number of divisors below 10 and use that as a set of players if we wanted to fully hide it (i think 120 is best here from memory)
2011-09-21T08:30:40  <antimatroid> but otherwise i think there's enough symmetries that people will find it hard enough to exploit symmetry
2011-09-21T08:32:07  <sir_macelon> delt0r: I know what you mean, but I don't see a point why we should hide a simple info for the bot if it is winning or not
2011-09-21T08:32:36  <sir_macelon> delt0r: anyway people will find a way the workaround this and some of them already did that
2011-09-21T08:33:07  <mcstar> why not drop fow too, right?
2011-09-21T08:33:10  * mcstar disagrees
2011-09-21T08:33:12  <sir_macelon> delt0r: by throwing it all in x last turns to maximize the score as the remaining ants are not being counted at all
2011-09-21T08:34:03  <sir_macelon> delt0r: this leads to rather artificial and odd behavior, than a neat game strategy
2011-09-21T08:35:45  <sir_macelon> delt0r: soon you'll notice everyone will go for on for all in last x turns, I don't think it is nice to encourage such "strategy"
2011-09-21T08:35:48  <delt0r> i really don't see it that way.. and right now if you get 2 points per ant killed. killing sprees are totally worth it
2011-09-21T08:36:00  <delt0r> why not?
2011-09-21T08:36:18  <delt0r> what is "wrong" with that strategy?
2011-09-21T08:36:40  <sir_macelon> everybody will do that then
2011-09-21T08:37:20  <sir_macelon> it won't be a strategy eventually it will be a must if you want to increase your score just before the game ends
2011-09-21T08:38:28  <mcstar> sir_macelon: we discussed NOT sending maxturns to the bots, at least i think its a good idea, not sure if it will happen
2011-09-21T08:38:29  <sir_macelon> there's nothing fancy about that strategy and I don't like it
2011-09-21T08:39:23  <sir_macelon> mcstar: it's a way to fix this, but then the bot will get even less information
2011-09-21T08:39:36  <mcstar> thats a pro for me :)
2011-09-21T08:39:51  <mcstar> id like a minimally invasive engine so to speAK
2011-09-21T08:40:22  <sir_macelon> I don't have anything against limiting the info a bot will receive
2011-09-21T08:41:06  <sir_macelon> but I strongly believe a bot has to know if it is winning or not, to plan its moves accordingly
2011-09-21T08:41:16  <mcstar> in that spirit id like to propose to limit viewradius to spawnradius!
2011-09-21T08:41:26  <mcstar> (lol, kidding)
2011-09-21T08:41:52  <sir_macelon> without it, there's too much luck on which bot decides to go for all or nothing

2011-09-21T08:42:35  <delt0r> sir_macelon: How you go about killing other ants will be far from boring/simple/easy/plain or anything else
2011-09-21T08:42:38  <mcstar> i think the bot should gather his info, and it already knows quite much, the size of the map for example, so it can make assumptions on how good its assumptions are
2011-09-21T08:42:43  <delt0r> one on one gets you *nothing*

2011-09-21T08:43:11  <delt0r> that is what its all about IMO
2011-09-21T08:43:31  <delt0r> anyway at 1000 turns with the size maps we have... i doubt games won't finish
2011-09-21T08:44:51  <mcstar> that im not so sure of
2011-09-21T08:44:57  <mcstar> really depends on the actual bots
2011-09-21T08:45:17  <mcstar> (if you meant some kind of all-but-one elimination)
2011-09-21T08:45:21  <sir_macelon> with a low food spawn rate games can't be decided in 1500 turn even
2011-09-21T08:45:57  <mcstar> its toatally possible that some logic lead to never ending games
2011-09-21T08:46:02  <antimatroid> is that true for smarter bots?
2011-09-21T08:46:04  <mcstar> with no apparent winners
2011-09-21T08:46:37  <antimatroid> ie. bots that actually path find for food and enemies
2011-09-21T08:46:58  <mcstar> antimatroid: it depends on how easily you let yourself get killed
2011-09-21T08:47:17  <mcstar> the "smarter" the bots, the longer it can live
2011-09-21T08:47:22  <mcstar> they*
2011-09-21T08:47:48  <antimatroid> kill it with fire!
2011-09-21T08:47:53  <antimatroid> :)
2011-09-21T08:48:04  <mcstar> i say burn the whole damn house
2011-09-21T08:50:10  <sir_macelon> delt0r: ono on one gets you *nothing*? I don't agree.
2011-09-21T08:50:15  <mcstar> but theres a point in there somewhere, i guess people already mentioned this, its rather trivial, but for a long game, where bots try to avoid battle, and they play quite similarly, and 1 bot wins by a small margin, it absolutely shouldnt get any bonuses
2011-09-21T08:50:17  <sir_macelon> delt0r: take a look at this game: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=186863
2011-09-21T08:50:55  <mcstar> 1 ant on 1 ant
2011-09-21T08:50:57  <sir_macelon> delt0r: one of the bots goes for all one on one and eventually wins the game having lest ants
2011-09-21T08:50:58  <mcstar> he meant
2011-09-21T08:51:10  <sir_macelon> mcstar: I know
2011-09-21T08:51:22  <sir_macelon> just see the game
2011-09-21T08:51:36  <sir_macelon> or last 50 turns rather
2011-09-21T08:51:50  <sir_macelon> now every bot will have to do that
2011-09-21T08:52:59  <sir_macelon> another example: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=177970
2011-09-21T08:53:19  <mcstar> i dont get it
2011-09-21T08:53:26  <mcstar> mathis could have done the same for example
2011-09-21T08:53:28  <sir_macelon> 7 high ranked bots and game wasn't decided after 1500 turns - all bots have survived
2011-09-21T08:53:29  <mcstar> but he didnt
2011-09-21T08:53:31  <mcstar> so what?
2011-09-21T08:53:39  <sir_macelon> that's the point
2011-09-21T08:53:48  <sir_macelon> everybody know should be doing this
2011-09-21T08:54:02  <sir_macelon> that is not a strategy that is a must
2011-09-21T08:54:03  <mcstar> greentea smartly attacked those ants, which was suicidal too, and mathis i think tried to avoid its enemies
2011-09-21T08:54:09  <sir_macelon> to bias the scoring system
2011-09-21T08:54:16  <mcstar> so greentea could gather points over mathis
2011-09-21T08:54:19  <olexs1> if only one bot does this, he gets a lot of +2 bonuses from 1-on-1 fights, while the "other side" +2s get split between all enemies he fights
2011-09-21T08:54:19  <delt0r> I dont; think the beta server is a good reflection of what good bots will be
2011-09-21T08:54:31  <delt0r> is not folks a game effort
2011-09-21T08:54:34  <delt0r> IMO
2011-09-21T08:54:37  <delt0r> for the most part
2011-09-21T08:55:14  <sir_macelon> you might be wrong here
2011-09-21T08:55:17  <mcstar> "is not folks a game effort" ?
2011-09-21T08:55:23  <sir_macelon> the beta is 4 months old now
2011-09-21T08:55:42  <mcstar> delt0r: help me i have trouble understanding that line
2011-09-21T08:55:43  <sir_macelon> and there are pretty advanced bots already
2011-09-21T08:56:17  <mcstar> noway, sir_macelon dont you tell me that youre game logic doesnt fit on 1 screen
2011-09-21T08:56:25  <mcstar> -e
2011-09-21T08:56:48  <delt0r> the beta page even says don't put "real" entries there
2011-09-21T08:57:06  <mcstar> that is for governmental workers
2011-09-21T08:57:14  <mcstar> with supersecret ai works
2011-09-21T08:57:28  <sir_macelon> delt0r: and you think people are not doing this?
2011-09-21T08:57:37  <delt0r> A game effort.. ie its not the comp where folks will be putting more hours etc and be far more competitive
2011-09-21T08:57:53  <delt0r> since rules and game scoring can all change
2011-09-21T08:57:54  <delt0r> etc
2011-09-21T08:58:00  <sir_macelon> mcstar: I am developing my bot like since april
2011-09-21T08:58:45  <sir_macelon> so it is rather complicated and the room for improvement is more and more limited
2011-09-21T08:59:17  <mcstar> yeah, well, i think i started right about then
2011-09-21T08:59:44  <mcstar> i worked up a couple of versions, than recently i gave it a rewrite
2011-09-21T09:00:08  <mcstar> and the bot that i will be using in the real contest will be an almost total rewrite if i can manage
2011-09-21T09:02:32  <delt0r> either way I really dislike this post scoring adjustment, and i don't like the idea of giving rank info or no. of players info
2011-09-21T09:02:55  <delt0r> if you want more combat just bump up the kill score
2011-09-21T09:03:24  <mcstar> well, if you know that which enemy belongs to which hive, can lead to sophisticated decisions, im somewhat inclined to think that is a good thing
2011-09-21T09:04:24  <delt0r> if they can't handle that much hidden info, then i am doubtful of the level of sophistication tbh
2011-09-21T09:04:54  <mcstar> what do you mean hidden info?
2011-09-21T09:05:20  <mcstar> if the engine doesnt send the id's of enemy ants, you have little way of knowing who are you fighting with
2011-09-21T09:05:53  <mcstar> recognizing previous actions of encountered ants doesnt give you the ability to predict an ant you just encountered
2011-09-21T09:06:07  <delt0r> ie scores and numbers of players
2011-09-21T09:06:18  <delt0r> or ranks/number of players
2011-09-21T09:06:41  <mcstar> they dont actually receive scores
2011-09-21T09:06:54  *** bhasker <bhasker!2a6c3819@gateway/web/freenode/ip.42.108.56.25> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-21T09:06:56  <mcstar> but what is your opinion on enemy id's?
2011-09-21T09:07:06  <delt0r> yea--but this is what was suggested above and i really don't like it..
2011-09-21T09:07:24  <mcstar> (sure, they shouldnt receive scores :) )
2011-09-21T09:07:25  <sir_macelon> delt0r: current situation leads to the bahvior like in the game I posted. Do you find it acceptable then?
2011-09-21T09:07:38  <delt0r> enemy id's? what do you mean. currenty you do get each ants "colour" or team...
2011-09-21T09:07:51  <mcstar> thats is an id
2011-09-21T09:07:56  <mcstar> from where i come from
2011-09-21T09:08:31  <delt0r> why not? --really why not... why this strong expectation of how things should turn out, and then change anything to "fix it" when they don't?
2011-09-21T09:10:06  <mcstar> i think this is just a different preferance of people: some consider full-informationgames more interesting than the opposite
2011-09-21T09:10:28  <sir_macelon> delt0r: because this leads to cloning this strategy by every bot? I don't find this sophisticated at all...
2011-09-21T09:10:50  <delt0r> I think its more "the most ants should win" or the "best score should win"
2011-09-21T09:10:59  <mcstar> sir_macelon: i imagin previous games had more of a "perfect strategy" odour to them
2011-09-21T09:11:04  <delt0r> sir_macelon: it will not
2011-09-21T09:11:49  <delt0r> finsih only after 300 turns?
2011-09-21T09:11:53  <sir_macelon> what I am trying to say is just to let the bots to know if they are winning or not, nothing more - no score adjustments or anything like that
2011-09-21T09:11:56  <delt0r> crap
2011-09-21T09:12:09  <delt0r> and i say don't
2011-09-21T09:12:20  <delt0r> its better AI when you don't always know
2011-09-21T09:12:24  <mcstar> noo, send minimal info, only id the enemies and give the map size
2011-09-21T09:12:53  <delt0r> yep.. as in like now mcstar?
2011-09-21T09:13:06  <mcstar> no
2011-09-21T09:13:11  <mcstar> dont send maxturns
2011-09-21T09:13:55  <mcstar> btw, delt0r how does your engine number the enemies? it is counted up from 1 for each hive, in the order of the other encountered hives in successon
2011-09-21T09:14:15  <delt0r> yes
2011-09-21T09:14:22  <mcstar> just checking :)
2011-09-21T09:14:31  <sir_macelon> there's a thin border there if you hide some information and make the bot assume that; and on the hand because of that making the games too random
2011-09-21T09:14:39  <delt0r> mcstar: i would like to not send maxturns... that is a throwback from plantwars
2011-09-21T09:14:59  <mcstar> i guess we agree than
2011-09-21T09:15:14  <delt0r> sir_macelon: but the bot "knows" what it is told.
2011-09-21T09:15:23  <delt0r> it knows the quality of the information
2011-09-21T09:15:31  <mcstar> now, lets work on sir_macelon, what is his address?
2011-09-21T09:15:36  <delt0r> the bots job is then to decide what to do with it
2011-09-21T09:15:54  <sir_macelon> what I mean is that if you limit some vital information then you won't have a space to develop an ai, but more like a guesser hoping for some luck
2011-09-21T09:15:59  <delt0r> wow-- mcstar, that is hidden info
2011-09-21T09:16:08  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-21T09:16:17  <delt0r> you have to deduce it from the data you have :D
2011-09-21T09:16:34  <delt0r> sir_macelon: that is simply not true
2011-09-21T09:16:58  <delt0r> even with max turns or not, this is very much nice info...
2011-09-21T09:17:16  <sir_macelon> the problem is you it is impossible to deduce the score from the information the bot has
2011-09-21T09:17:47  <delt0r> you have perfect knowledge of what you can see
2011-09-21T09:17:56  <delt0r> sir_macelon: SO
2011-09-21T09:17:58  <sir_macelon> delt0r: you are very stubborn :D
2011-09-21T09:18:04  <delt0r> maximize score incress
2011-09-21T09:18:16  <delt0r> sir_macelon: right back at ya
2011-09-21T09:19:38  <delt0r> for a harder problem --look at the soccer simulation league..
2011-09-21T09:19:45  <delt0r> vision is imperfect
2011-09-21T09:19:51  <delt0r> everything is imperfect
2011-09-21T09:20:05  <delt0r> you can't even kick the ball "perfectly"
2011-09-21T09:20:09  <bhasker> the point is not to write a bot that optimizes for maximum score given certain number of turns
2011-09-21T09:20:20  <delt0r> I thought it was
2011-09-21T09:20:22  <bhasker> the point is to write a bot that plays well in most games
2011-09-21T09:20:24  <sir_macelon> if you don't know the score you have to make alomst random assumptions which could lead to various random behaviours of the bot
2011-09-21T09:20:37  <delt0r> aka wins the tournament
2011-09-21T09:20:55  <bhasker> sir_macelon thats how a rts is in most cases?
2011-09-21T09:20:59  <delt0r> sir_macelon: you really don't need to make random assumptions
2011-09-21T09:21:04  <bhasker> you don't necessary have complete information
2011-09-21T09:21:14  <bhasker> you make the best assumptions given the data
2011-09-21T09:21:26  <bhasker> there is nothing random about it
2011-09-21T09:21:33  <bhasker> given the same data your bot should play identically
2011-09-21T09:21:37  <mcstar> i guess he mean uniform probaility
2011-09-21T09:21:38  <delt0r> and you can get your ants to move around to give you *better* information
2011-09-21T09:21:42  <mcstar> means*
2011-09-21T09:21:43  <sir_macelon> well in the end, I don't have anything against not having this info, I can deal with that, but this info would give some more options for bot strategies
2011-09-21T09:22:04  <bhasker> i think the bot strategies will be better if ants lived multiple turns
2011-09-21T09:22:09  <bhasker> and actually had hitpoints
2011-09-21T09:22:14  <delt0r> I simply cannot see how your strategies are reduced
2011-09-21T09:22:15  <bhasker> instead of being killed in one battle
2011-09-21T09:22:21  <bhasker> that would make it most interesting
2011-09-21T09:23:29  <sir_macelon> delt0r: if I don't know the score, I won't even try to predict it and if I would know it then I could base strategies on that
2011-09-21T09:24:05  <mcstar> in the real world, there would be no authority, to end the "war", its only a practical aspect, therefore it should be totally oblivious to the players, and in the same manner they shouldnt know about their score relative to other's, again, a bot should gather local info. and extrapolate local information to global inf.
2011-09-21T09:24:37  <mcstar> sir_macelon: thats bad, you should certainly could use some sort of "measure" of how well youre doing
2011-09-21T09:24:51  <mcstar> but you should do it for yourself
2011-09-21T09:24:55  <sir_macelon> before you get the ants count to see the whole map, there's a lot that can happen where other players score points and there's no way you could predict that
2011-09-21T09:25:46  <delt0r> I can keep track of the scoring i do see and use that to bound scores...
2011-09-21T09:25:58  <mcstar> you could base your startegy on the first encounter of enemies in every direction
2011-09-21T09:25:59  <delt0r> for example
2011-09-21T09:26:19  <sir_macelon> mcstar: the only "reliable" measure would be the ants count and it is perfectly usable, but how you would predict the scores?
2011-09-21T09:26:24  <delt0r> this also encourages exploration
2011-09-21T09:26:39  <mcstar> sir_macelon: lol, that is the part of AI
2011-09-21T09:26:47  <mcstar> which you need to write
2011-09-21T09:26:51  <mcstar> (one part of)
2011-09-21T09:27:11  <delt0r> also you know your score perfectly
2011-09-21T09:27:15  <mcstar> think up some kinf of weighted average, and optimize the weight using GA
2011-09-21T09:27:47  <delt0r> etc... there are plenty of ways to do this...
2011-09-21T09:28:45  <delt0r> in the end the player with the most ants left may not win... so conserving ants at all cost is just one extrema strat that will Generally not work
2011-09-21T09:44:05  <mcstar> btw, im not really sure why did this more-than-enough-participant beta happened(and why was it soo long), i mean what was in previous contests? was the engine harder to write? or much less people knew about the contest?
2011-09-21T09:44:19  <mcstar> i guess this might be the sign of a popularity explosion
2011-09-21T09:44:33  <mcstar> than, it would mean massively more participants in the live contest

2011-09-21T09:55:37  <delt0r> in terms of engine and bots
2011-09-21T09:55:41  <antimatroid> planet wars was a harder problem
2011-09-21T09:55:59  <delt0r> I think ants is a far harder problem
2011-09-21T09:56:29  <antimatroid> i think ants offers more depth in the way of things one can actually work on to improve their bot

2011-09-21T11:48:13  <mleise> hi
2011-09-21T11:49:33  <medrimonia2> I'm actually experiencing troubles to download the tools for ants beta. the link seems to be dead
2011-09-21T11:51:13  <medrimonia2> Has anyone still the tools.tar.bz2 or tools.zip on his computer?
2011-09-21T11:51:26  <cichociemno> medrimonia2: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip

2011-09-21T11:52:20  <janzert> ahh, the problem is that the using_the_tools page is using an absolute link to ai-contest.com for some reason
2011-09-21T11:52:28  <medrimonia2> apparently, the link is going to http://ai-contest.com/tools.zip
2011-09-21T11:52:34  <medrimonia2> Exactly
2011-09-21T11:52:46  <janzert> medrimonia2: btw, if you're not on windows you want the .tar.bz2 file
2011-09-21T11:52:49  <medrimonia2> thanks a lot
2011-09-21T11:52:56  <janzert> they don't have the same files in them
2011-09-21T11:53:02  <medrimonia2> oh I can take both there's no problems
2011-09-21T11:53:24  <medrimonia2> I should be able to find the tar.bz2 file with the tip cichociemno gave me
2011-09-21T11:53:38  * janzert nods
2011-09-21T11:54:11  <medrimonia2> that's all right
2011-09-21T11:54:24  <medrimonia2> I got the file, I can start having fun again!
2011-09-21T11:54:38  * janzert tries to figure out how that page is generated now ;)

2011-09-21T12:02:54  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm hoping links in the wiki can translate to links on the main site
2011-09-21T12:03:17  <janzert> hmm?
2011-09-21T12:03:33  <janzert> if they're relative links they should work for any installation
2011-09-21T12:04:17  <janzert> they'll be broken in the github wiki, but they were currently broken there anyway
2011-09-21T12:05:26  <McLeopold> yeah, too bad we can't translate them properly for both
2011-09-21T12:05:57  <McLeopold> we'd have to assume the *.php file names
2011-09-21T12:07:00  <McLeopold> we could overload the title of the link
2011-09-21T12:07:28  <janzert> eck, I'd say just leave it for now at least
2011-09-21T12:07:35  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-09-21T12:08:00  <janzert> I think it's a minor problem with no really nice solution
2011-09-21T12:08:26  <janzert> i.e. unfortunate but not something to worry too much about
2011-09-21T12:08:35  <McLeopold> so, did you see sir-macelon's suggestion on github?
2011-09-21T12:08:48  <McLeopold> about knowing the score during the game?
2011-09-21T12:09:11  <janzert> not really
2011-09-21T12:09:27  <janzert> just a very light skim of it but if that's what it was about I missed the point
2011-09-21T12:10:11  <McLeopold> well, I'm on the fence.  At first we said we wouldn't provide that information.  Now I could be convinced otherwise.
2011-09-21T12:10:31  <janzert> I think I'd rather not still
2011-09-21T12:10:35  <mcstar> McLeopold: no score, and no maxturn info
2011-09-21T12:10:45  <mcstar> how about that?
2011-09-21T12:10:46  <janzert> max turn is there isn't it?
2011-09-21T12:10:53  <McLeopold> mcstar: max turn info will be there, and is now
2011-09-21T12:11:03  <mcstar> there was a discussion today about this, maybe you could read up
2011-09-21T12:11:16  <McLeopold> I have no problems with an end game suicide
2011-09-21T12:11:17  <mcstar> thats bad
2011-09-21T12:11:38  <mcstar> but at least dont tell the bots the scores orwhatever
2011-09-21T12:12:50  <McLeopold> jnwhiteh: the bots are located at ants/dist/starter_bots/go
2011-09-21T12:12:57  <jnwhiteh> ah lovely, thanks.

2011-09-21T12:25:28  <delt0r> McLeopold: I also have no problem with end game suicide... as long as the dont just sit there going back and forward
2011-09-21T12:26:32  <McLeopold> If it is part of the game, then I will put in in the strategy guide.
2011-09-21T12:26:38  <delt0r> but no maxturn is also ok in my book... not in favor of giving them their rank or if they are winning
2011-09-21T12:27:13  <janzert> do you think the pairing code is in shape to go live now?
2011-09-21T12:27:15  <UncleVasya> book?
2011-09-21T12:27:19  <McLeopold> we didn't want to do that because we hide the number of enemies in the game
2011-09-21T12:27:39  <delt0r> in my book <- english expression that mean Ok by me
2011-09-21T12:27:40  <McLeopold> janzert: it is a lot better now, the game count and games in last 24 look really good
2011-09-21T12:28:11  <UncleVasya> thanks
2011-09-21T12:28:17  <McLeopold> the true skill match quality is not as prominant, but it was causing too many issues
2011-09-21T12:28:24  <UncleVasya> I thought you are writing book about contest :)
2011-09-21T12:28:25  <janzert> the only part I'm slightly concerned is that 10% may be too large, but we can narrow that once it's live in needed
2011-09-21T12:29:15  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: think of "in my book" as an alternate reality where you get everything you want
2011-09-21T12:29:15  <UncleVasya> Or making something like books with turns in chess programs.
2011-09-21T12:29:43  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, the percentage is easy to adjust
2011-09-21T12:29:44  <UncleVasya> ok, I've got it.
2011-09-21T12:30:14  <McLeopold> janzert: but you are the one that wanted the power curve, so...?
2011-09-21T12:30:34  <janzert> it's not enough of a power curve :)
2011-09-21T12:31:24  <janzert> basically the 10% starts out linear and doesn't create close enough matches frequently enough is what I'm worried about
2011-09-21T12:32:11  <McLeopold> I can reset and change it to 5%?
2011-09-21T12:32:34  <McLeopold> plus, now that the 24 hour average is even, this reset will look even better
2011-09-21T12:33:54  <janzert> not sure it even needs a reset, but it might not be a bad idea to see the reset again

2011-09-21T12:34:15  <janzert> but I'm wondering if a percentage is the right measure to use here
2011-09-21T12:34:29  <janzert> would a hard number say 50 be better
2011-09-21T12:34:37  *** dvladim <dvladim!~dvladim@85.113.131.65> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-21T12:34:58  <McLeopold> it would be faster :)
2011-09-21T12:35:23  <janzert> 5% now is 20 but 5% during the contest may be 200 or so
2011-09-21T12:35:27  <McLeopold> its at about 40 right now
2011-09-21T12:36:39  <janzert> theoretically the right thing to do is probably to pick a sigma delta and then check how many participants would fall in that delta
2011-09-21T12:37:08  <janzert> but I think that would get quite expensive?
2011-09-21T12:38:18  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-21T12:38:39  <McLeopold> I don't think that would be good at all
2011-09-21T12:39:18  <McLeopold> that's almost like saying "pick the player with about as many games as me"
2011-09-21T12:39:37  <janzert> oops, sorry I meant mu not sigma
2011-09-21T12:39:52  <janzert> yes, sigma would be really bad
2011-09-21T12:40:59  <janzert> it would hold match quality roughly the same across all the ranks no matter how quickly the skill was varying in that portion of the ranks
2011-09-21T12:41:30  <janzert> by match quality I mean spread of skills in the players
2011-09-21T12:42:47  <McLeopold> I could do a match quality delta, but it would be slower
2011-09-21T12:43:05  <McLeopold> If I did that, I'd want to drop the fake power curve
2011-09-21T12:43:21  <janzert> that's what I'm afraid it would get too slow
2011-09-21T12:43:58  <janzert> you'd still want a power curve though, this would just 'calibrate' the curve so the overall match quality stays the same
2011-09-21T12:44:26  <McLeopold> I have to calc all the match qualities once to get the max, then again to filter
2011-09-21T12:44:31  <McLeopold> unless I use a temp table
2011-09-21T12:44:33  <eashoka> janzert : did I hear we are happy with current pairing/matching ? I thought it's for testing. :-) pls have a look at this profile and it's top 2 games. http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=188
2011-09-21T12:44:54  <McLeopold> eashoka: we are thinking we are close, but please keep looking for issues
2011-09-21T12:45:23  <eashoka> janzert, mc leaopold : ah g8! I have loads to report! :-)
2011-09-21T12:45:55  <janzert> yeah, the current pairing is too spread out that's what we were just discussing
2011-09-21T12:45:56  <McLeopold> what's wrong with the profile?
2011-09-21T12:46:21  <eashoka> given bot has got it's last 2 games (after waiting 1 and 20 minutes) it has won both games it was given, but each game has made it loose in skill points.
2011-09-21T12:46:36  <McLeopold> oh, the trueskill is fine
2011-09-21T12:46:48  <janzert> oh, I thought you just didn't like that a top 10 was playing 300+ ranked bots
2011-09-21T12:47:01  <McLeopold> mu is the same, just the sigma increased a little
2011-09-21T12:47:11  <janzert> right
2011-09-21T12:47:30  <eashoka> but from the point of that bot, after 1 hour 20 minutes of possible opportunity to go up in rank, it has got low in skill due to no fault of it's own ?
2011-09-21T12:47:52  <McLeopold> hmm..that seems really off
2011-09-21T12:47:57  <janzert> it's just a result of playing such low ranked players
2011-09-21T12:48:01  <McLeopold> I didn't think that was possible
2011-09-21T12:48:07  <eashoka> jancert : yea I didn't like that as well :-) (top bots playing lowere ones all the time) that was just testing right ?
2011-09-21T12:48:34  <McLeopold> no, that is a problem
2011-09-21T12:48:38  <janzert> trueskill is basically saying this game didn't give us any useful information
2011-09-21T12:49:00  <McLeopold> I need to see who the seeds were
2011-09-21T12:49:32  <McLeopold> I think the rank 4 player is being pulled in
2011-09-21T12:50:22  <janzert> yeah, it should be closer to a 1 in 1000 game occurrence. twice in a row is rather fishy
2011-09-21T12:53:37  <janzert> McLeopold: what do you think about moving to an ec2 main server within the next week?
2011-09-21T12:53:49  <janzert> then we can let demerzel have his server back
2011-09-21T12:56:28  <McLeopold> janzert: this weekend
2011-09-21T12:56:38  <McLeopold> maybe friday?
2011-09-21T12:57:12  <janzert> should work for me

2011-09-21T13:08:36  <UncleVasya> On the web it's ai-contest.com but on irc it's #aichellenge. I think it can be a little confusing for some people.
2011-09-21T13:09:05  <janzert> I'll just put up an instance myself to transfer the beta server to
2011-09-21T13:09:20  <McLeopold> okay, but isn't the current server cheaper?
2011-09-21T13:09:31  <janzert> the current ai-contest.com?
2011-09-21T13:09:34  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-21T13:09:49  <janzert> it's j3camero's personal dedicated server
2011-09-21T13:10:03  <janzert> hosts several sites of his
2011-09-21T13:10:17  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-21T13:10:22  <janzert> I don't want to go make invasive changes to it
2011-09-21T13:10:31  <McLeopold> so, isn't ec2 more expensive than others?
2011-09-21T13:10:58  <janzert> I thought it would be but once I priced it out the difference isn't that much
2011-09-21T13:11:17  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-21T13:11:57  <janzert> and if we use a spot instance with a high bid price it should be quite a bit cheaper
2011-09-21T13:12:13  <UncleVasya> Maybe you can register #aicontest or #ai-contest. For first time just place there an invitation to this channel and in future come and settle there.
2011-09-21T13:12:46  <janzert> the only thing I'm not completely sure of is how the stability will compare, that's another reason I'd like to move the beta over to it
2011-09-21T13:13:05  <janzert> so we can see how it goes before we commit to using it for the live contest
2011-09-21T13:13:13  <McLeopold> I'd hate for the spot price to spike and we loose the server
2011-09-21T13:13:52  <janzert> two things one is we bid at or just above the regular instance price, so the spot price shouldn't ever go that high
2011-09-21T13:14:20  <janzert> and also we use an EBS backed instance so the data doesn't go away if the instance does
2011-09-21T13:14:29  <janzert> unlike the workers

2011-09-21T15:10:24  <McLeopold> janzert: drop table tmp_p; create table tmp_p select user_id, floor(10.0 / pow(rand(),0.7)) as p from user; select p, count(*) from tmp_p group by p;
2011-09-21T15:11:30  <McLeopold> janzert: that give a pareto distribution of numbers from 10 to about 840.  10 is the most common
2011-09-21T15:12:55  <McLeopold> since the round-robin logic will most likely be the largest factor for a given range of players, the worst match quality will probably be selected for the match
2011-09-21T15:13:59  <McLeopold> the random number will define the number of players in the pool of opponents to select from
2011-09-21T15:14:24  <McLeopold> this also means that odd matches won't happen until all the better matches have occured

2011-09-21T15:18:54  <McLeopold> janzert: 80% are in the range of 10-30 closest submission
2011-09-21T15:18:58  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-21T15:19:36  <McLeopold> we can adjust 10 and 0.7 to get the curve we want, and test it across different numbers of players
2011-09-21T15:19:57  <janzert> that's good but almost all matches will pull from to other 20% because of least played against ordering right?
2011-09-21T15:20:54  <janzert> having least played against as the highest priority seems like it may be too much

2011-09-21T15:28:59  <janzert> maybe we should go back to just match quality but permute that ordering so they are selected in a pareto distribution?

2011-09-21T16:48:55  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, most opponents would be pulled from the low end of the range, but that is good
2011-09-21T16:51:36  <McLeopold> the pool of players should be extended to the full range about 1 every 1000 games, in which case the opponent would be whoever played with seed player the least

2011-09-21T16:52:35  <McLeopold> if it is a fairly new seed player, then we will still pull a higher match quality
2011-09-21T16:54:04  <McLeopold> so, the size of the pool of available players follows a pareto distribution.  if we always picked the worst player, then the opponents would follow that distribution as well
2011-09-21T16:54:43  <McLeopold> so new players would be baised toward picking good matchups and only established players would follow the power curve

2011-09-21T17:11:33  <janzert> sounds like it should work
2011-09-21T17:12:29  <McLeopold> yep
2011-09-21T17:13:02  <McLeopold> 80% will be between 16 and 50 of the closest
2011-09-21T17:13:22  <McLeopold> 1 out of 1000 will be the full range

2011-09-21T17:19:52  <McLeopold> delt0r_: glad you approve
2011-09-21T17:19:53  <delt0r_> yay
2011-09-21T17:20:01  <delt0r_> :D
2011-09-21T17:20:19  <McLeopold> is your engine on github or another dsc?
2011-09-21T17:20:25  <delt0r_> no
2011-09-21T17:20:41  <delt0r_> its needs work before seeing the light of day
2011-09-21T17:20:53  <McLeopold> can it see the light of McLeopold?
2011-09-21T17:21:20  <delt0r_> Well.... is pretty hacked up and i kinda got my planet wars and stuff in the same repo
2011-09-21T17:21:33  <delt0r_> its also really not finished
2011-09-21T17:21:43  <delt0r_> ie no scores for food left
2011-09-21T17:21:54  <delt0r_> and no inital food spawned
2011-09-21T17:21:58  <McLeopold> that's not a big deal
2011-09-21T17:22:07  <McLeopold> that is
2011-09-21T17:22:10  <delt0r_> but sure i can do the git daemn thing
2011-09-21T17:22:13  <delt0r_> daemon
2011-09-21T17:23:49  <McLeopold> it would be cool to make a war file for setting up a tcp server, your engine would be needed for that
2011-09-21T17:24:03  <delt0r_> mmm
2011-09-21T17:24:07  <delt0r_> could look into that
2011-09-21T17:24:19  <delt0r_> been a few years since i did any tomcat stuff
2011-09-21T17:24:50  <delt0r_> so git://delt0r.boldlygoingnowhere.org/home/git/ai2000/
2011-09-21T17:24:51  <McLeopold> I'm not sure how to handle ports with their own protocol, I'm fairly new at it.
2011-09-21T17:24:58  <delt0r_> in its raw hacked form
2011-09-21T17:25:17  <delt0r_> did lots of network stuff
2011-09-21T17:25:53  <delt0r_> tbh i didn't think folks would want a war for this sort of thing
2011-09-21T17:26:21  <McLeopold> I would think they would want a turn key solution
2011-09-21T17:26:23  <delt0r_> but i can of course put some time into it if it was going to be used... however I am in Germany all next week
2011-09-21T17:26:38  <delt0r_> do people consider tomcat turnkey?
2011-09-21T17:26:43  <McLeopold> I do
2011-09-21T17:26:45  <delt0r_> or worse j2ee
2011-09-21T17:27:03  <delt0r_> at least then you have persistence management
2011-09-21T17:27:15  <delt0r_> interesting...
2011-09-21T17:27:23  <McLeopold> at least war files
2011-09-21T17:27:29  <McLeopold> that's kinda the point of them
2011-09-21T17:27:42  <delt0r_> only if the server is set up correctly
2011-09-21T17:27:58  <delt0r_> aka the war file connects to a db
2011-09-21T17:28:26  <delt0r_> tomcat IIRC won't give that... but jboss/j2ee containers do
2011-09-21T17:28:40  <delt0r_> at least last time i was doing this
2011-09-21T17:28:42  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-21T17:28:45  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-21T17:28:46  <delt0r_> about 5 years ago now
2011-09-21T17:29:09  <McLeopold> I swear I did a db one recently without having to think about it...
2011-09-21T17:29:43  <delt0r_> I will check up on it...can't hurt my health... and i am already on my 2nd beer... no point doing real work
2011-09-21T17:29:56  <McLeopold> so, where is the ants engine?
2011-09-21T17:30:03  <delt0r_> also that url for git will work for some time
2011-09-21T17:30:20  <delt0r_> deltor/borgant/AntEngine.java
2011-09-21T17:30:43  <delt0r_> or you mean the url?
2011-09-21T17:30:52  <McLeopold> you answered it
2011-09-21T17:31:13  <delt0r_> right... i have slow upload --didn't expect you to have it already
2011-09-21T17:31:27  <McLeopold> what's all the explosion stuff?
2011-09-21T17:31:38  <delt0r_> hopefully i wasn't too much of a potty mount in the git logs

2011-09-21T17:32:55  <McLeopold> nebular
2011-09-21T17:33:04  <delt0r_> don't remeber if its still working
2011-09-21T17:33:18  * delt0r_ checks it out
2011-09-21T17:33:45  <delt0r_> hehe
2011-09-21T17:33:50  <delt0r_> its not working properly
2011-09-21T17:34:04  <delt0r_> Was still hacking around
2011-09-21T17:34:10  <delt0r_> otherwise you use the viewer
2011-09-21T17:34:46  <delt0r_> should work if all the resourses are included.. don't remeber if they are.. lots of sprite sheets

2011-09-21T17:40:56  <McLeopold> cool
2011-09-21T17:41:09  <delt0r_> so you are right... it should be close to turn key as you can expect
2011-09-21T17:41:12  <McLeopold> If it had been hard, I would have remembered what I did :)
2011-09-21T17:41:34  <delt0r_> sounds a lot easier than when i was doing it last
2011-09-21T17:41:43  <delt0r_> I didn't mind JSP either

2011-09-21T17:52:01  <McLeopold> my reset clears the data, I can make it ignore deleted matchups
2011-09-21T17:52:21  <janzert> right if kill is really getting called then release shouldn't be complaining

2011-09-21T18:10:51  <janzert> well we could simply mount home under another volume since that's where the majority of it is going
2011-09-21T18:11:12  <janzert> when I started this I thought just expanding the size would be fairly easy though

2011-09-21T19:52:42  <McLeopold> janzert: fixed it for you :)
2011-09-21T19:52:45  <janzert> yay :)
2011-09-21T19:53:08  <McLeopold> it's still missing a few indexes from the beta server
2011-09-21T19:53:30  <janzert> gah, so the line 6 above is supposed to be offset from the line 113 mentioned first?
2011-09-21T19:53:54  <McLeopold> yeah, I ran the sql, and looked at the last table created, the looked at the statement after that

2011-09-21T19:57:52  <janzert> which now gets the setup to a visualizer build failure http://pastebin.com/EJmNLM53
2011-09-21T19:58:21  <janzert> mleise: the visualizer build now requires node.js? maybe? :}
2011-09-21T19:59:00  <mleise> janzert: oh yes very probably
2011-09-21T19:59:58  <mleise> I left that as an exercise for the reader ... or so they say
2011-09-21T20:00:05  <janzert> you know of any other packages that probably weren't added to the server_setup script yet?
2011-09-21T20:01:20  <janzert> looks like that might be it
2011-09-21T20:03:23  <mleise> janzert: The JavaScript startes needed Node before, didn't they?
2011-09-21T20:03:36  <mleise> I wasn't aware I added a new dependency
2011-09-21T20:04:00  <janzert> the languages submissions run in aren't installed on the main server
2011-09-21T20:04:06  <mleise> no, i know of no other packages. at least not by me
2011-09-21T20:04:54  <janzert> most happen to be on the current server because it was used as a worker before the worker's were running bots sandboxed
