2011-09-25T00:10:22  *** okay| is now known as okayzed
2011-09-25T00:47:22  <McLeopold> eashoka: arlequ1 just got close enough in rank to you that he will play you more often.  since you haven't played much together, you'll get paired a little more often.
2011-09-25T00:48:06  <McLeopold> I could probably put back in the no repeat logic to slow the pace down, and I could probably widen the range of typical matches
2011-09-25T00:48:22  <antimatroid> personally i think maybe widen the range once the contest starts?
2011-09-25T00:48:35  <antimatroid> i was just going to say this is probably pretty cool for ranking reasons but i also like a variety in opponents :)
2011-09-25T00:49:19  <antimatroid> but yeah, more games against people close in the ranks is probably a good thing for getting more accurate rankings in the neighbourhood around you, although it may make it harder for a bot to climb if it has a bad start in the finals maybe?
2011-09-25T00:50:12  <McLeopold> the big difference is he was *new* in that range of the ranks, so we pair him a bit more often with everyone else there
2011-09-25T00:51:01  <McLeopold> for eashoka, the most often played opponent is 18 games, then it takes 21 opponents to drop to 10 games
2011-09-25T00:51:41  <McLeopold> antimatroid: any work on multiple start maps?
2011-09-25T00:52:02  <antimatroid> nope, got heaps of uni work at the moment
2011-09-25T00:52:07  <antimatroid> i'll try and take a look tonight if i have time
2011-09-25T00:52:28  <antimatroid> or when i get bored of doing assignments :)
2011-09-25T00:52:35  <McLeopold> so, how much time do you have tonight to do ants?
2011-09-25T00:52:52  <antimatroid> technically zero :)
2011-09-25T00:52:57  <McLeopold> :(
2011-09-25T00:53:04  <antimatroid> but i'll get sick of doing work at some point
2011-09-25T00:53:21  <McLeopold> okay, I'll need your help later...
2011-09-25T00:53:31  <McLeopold> stick around IRC for a few hours
2011-09-25T00:53:41  <antimatroid> it's like 3 weeks before the end of classes and I have 3 classes and a thesis :\
2011-09-25T00:53:50  <antimatroid> when am i not on irc? :P
2011-09-25T00:53:57  <antimatroid> if i'm at home, i'm at my computer or will be soon
2011-09-25T00:54:05  <McLeopold> never, but sometimes your not responsive :)
2011-09-25T00:54:19  <McLeopold> @seen j3camero
2011-09-25T00:54:19  <contestbot> McLeopold: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 13 weeks, 5 days, 1 hour, 54 minutes, and 16 seconds ago: <j3camero> Text me at 416 464 3096.
2011-09-25T00:54:20  <antimatroid> yeah, it's 3pm i'll be around for hours :)
2011-09-25T00:54:26  <McLeopold> but not that bad :)
2011-09-25T00:54:38  <McLeopold> ok, cool
2011-09-25T00:56:20  <eashoka> McLeopold : tx for the detailed and very convincing explanation. :-)
2011-09-25T00:57:43  <antimatroid> eashoka: did you get my message?
2011-09-25T00:57:52  <antimatroid> i was late to the party and just saw it in the forums yesterday :P
2011-09-25T00:59:04  <McLeopold> eashoka: if you look at all your games, since the last reset, you'll see opponents matchups are fairly even
2011-09-25T00:59:25  <eashoka> McLeopold : yea, it looks much nicer now.
2011-09-25T01:00:16  <eashoka> antimatroid : think I got your first msg. (about the planet wars blog post). tx. was there any other after that ? I got disconnected often and lost history
2011-09-25T01:00:37  <antimatroid> nah sorry, just said it was a cool read :)
2011-09-25T01:01:02  <antimatroid> i'm super keen to get zeta going once i finish uni for the year
2011-09-25T01:01:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: keen or are you burnt out?
2011-09-25T01:01:54  <eashoka> antimatroid : Tx. Hope you will have time to compete in this one. :-)
2011-09-25T01:02:30  <antimatroid> not likely if it launches soon
2011-09-25T01:02:41  <antimatroid> but i think that might perhaps be good considering how much input i had on the game
2011-09-25T01:07:35  <eashoka> antimatroid : ah no. I think most of beta testers too are now quite close in familiarity as you are. Once the input was given, approved and adopted, it become everybody's. :-)
2011-09-25T01:08:13  <antimatroid> yeah that's the official stance
2011-09-25T01:08:34  <antimatroid> if i did have time i would probably compete anyway, but i still have had longer than most to think about the problem
2011-09-25T01:09:04  <antimatroid> people will complain about the beta testers, but people always find something to complain about, the more trivial the complaints the better we're doing
2011-09-25T01:11:23  <eashoka> antimatroid : complete new comers will have a disadvantage I agree, but I don't see how that could have been avoided. also, without ppl like you helping out, there may not have been a contest in the first place :-) BTW, you still a student .. which year ?
2011-09-25T01:11:56  <antimatroid> doing my honours year this year
2011-09-25T01:12:04  <antimatroid> 5th year of uni, did a combined undergrad degree :P
2011-09-25T01:16:01  <antimatroid> eashoka: what year are you in? and what are you studying?
2011-09-25T01:18:29  <McLeopold> antimatroid: not burnt out, but will probably still to web/database and avoid compiler/worker stuff
2011-09-25T01:19:00  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'll be back in about 8 hours, I hope your around then. :)
2011-09-25T01:19:28  <McLeopold> eashoka: where is your write -up of planet wars?
2011-09-25T01:19:33  <antimatroid> should be, but not much later than that :)
2011-09-25T01:20:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: http://iq-games.blogspot.com/2011/02/planet-wars-my-first-ai-contest.html
2011-09-25T01:21:53  <eashoka> McLeopold : it had too parts, both in the same blog
2011-09-25T01:22:00  <eashoka> too - > two
2011-09-25T01:22:30  <antimatroid> ohh, i think i missed the second part
2011-09-25T01:23:06  <antimatroid> eashoka: why isn't there a link at the bottom to the second part? :P
2011-09-25T01:23:18  <eashoka> antimatroid : cool! so we can call you Dr animatroid in few months time I guess ;-)
2011-09-25T01:23:29  <antimatroid> no no, honours is not a phd
2011-09-25T01:23:46  <antimatroid> i'm contemplating starting a phd next year (if i can get funding) but that's another 3-4 years :)
2011-09-25T01:23:48  <eashoka> antimatroid : b'cos part 2 was not there at the time I wrote part 1 :-) actually will put a link there now. tx
2011-09-25T01:24:10  <janzert> amstan: ping
2011-09-25T01:24:32  <antimatroid> in australia people usually do a 3 year undergrad degree, a 1 year honours degree and then a phd, but my undergrad was 4 years because i did a combined degre
2011-09-25T01:25:06  <janzert> contestbot: later tell amstan any chance you could get Jeff to come by Monday evening for a meeting?
2011-09-25T01:25:06  <contestbot> janzert: Job's done.
2011-09-25T01:27:01  <antimatroid> eashoka: in the second part you have an "invented" which should be "invested"
2011-09-25T01:27:08  <antimatroid> not sure if typo or language mistake :)
2011-09-25T01:27:22  <antimatroid> /s/ed/ing
2011-09-25T01:27:31  <antimatroid> investing that is
2011-09-25T01:28:37  <antimatroid> eashoka: the additional main thing i had was redirected moves, if i was sending ships to a neutral or enemy but could redirect them to one of my plants and get them to the destination planet before i expected to actually take the planet then i would
2011-09-25T01:28:56  <antimatroid> which gave you the opportunity to use such fleets elsewhere sooner if necessary but still use them for their intended purpose if that was still optimal
2011-09-25T01:29:21  <antimatroid> plus my game tree (which was horribly broken) for trying to work out what offensive moves to make
2011-09-25T01:30:33  <eashoka> u did a min-max tree ?
2011-09-25T01:31:34  <eashoka> antimatroid : for your options against opponents possible replies... ? hmm I never got to that point.
2011-09-25T01:31:47  <antimatroid> i did, but what i submitted was horribly broken
2011-09-25T01:32:00  <antimatroid> still worked alright though, i don't think my rank would have improved if it wasn't broken
2011-09-25T01:32:15  <antimatroid> my way of working out what moves to consider was extremely inefficient
2011-09-25T01:32:24  <antimatroid> minimax trees worked wonderfully for tron
2011-09-25T01:34:17  <eashoka> antimatroid : I relied on calculations. amount of fleets I can gather in the long run, amount of reinforcements, time the fleets take to travel, impact from growth etc and then produced a big equation which I could use to determine any planet can be taken or not.
2011-09-25T01:35:46  <eashoka> antimatroid : then I used that against all enemy planets taking the nearer ones first and if it seemed ok for any planet. I would trigger. which worked out pretty decently....
2011-09-25T01:50:19  <eashoka> antimatroid : corrected the things you pointed out. Tx

2011-09-25T05:55:32  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure it's not fake as well :\
2011-09-25T05:55:50  <mcstar> yeah, the store isnt, but the spam is
2011-09-25T05:56:03  <mcstar> well, not fake just unsolicited
2011-09-25T05:56:03  <antimatroid> (they had multiple sizes and colours too, it wasn't just something someone didn't want)
2011-09-25T05:56:18  <antimatroid> yeah, spam is not wanted, just pointing out my awesome ebay purchase :P
2011-09-25T05:56:18  <mcstar> i have a north face baseball hat
2011-09-25T05:56:55  <mcstar> i had a head injury, and i had a couple of stitches, so i bought the hat, but i didnt wear since than
2011-09-25T05:57:46  <mcstar> antimatroid: you should have billed the store instead of deleting the "ad"
2011-09-25T05:58:00  <mcstar> we could have had a couple more EC2's

2011-09-25T06:07:33  <antimatroid> i believe there's a 3d game like planet wars along those lines?
2011-09-25T06:07:37  <UncleVasya> why? Because of knapsack?
2011-09-25T06:07:39  <antimatroid> i was just reminded of someone mentioning it in here
2011-09-25T06:07:42  <mcstar> yes galcon
2011-09-25T06:07:47  <antimatroid> no, no
2011-09-25T06:07:54  <antimatroid> a 3d game that is actually on ships with islands etc.
2011-09-25T06:08:28  <mcstar> now i know what knapsack is
2011-09-25T06:08:48  <mcstar> theres an image on the forum, on the left-top side

2011-09-25T06:12:43  <mcstar> one eye is covered?
2011-09-25T06:12:55  <mcstar> and its like a cyberpirate
2011-09-25T06:13:02  <mcstar> and it takes your space...
2011-09-25T06:13:06  <mcstar> its clear to me
2011-09-25T06:13:12  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you think that is a girl?
2011-09-25T06:14:06  <antimatroid> no, i thought you meant the spam site :P
2011-09-25T06:14:41  <mcstar> ah
2011-09-25T06:15:18  <mcstar> All your planet are belong to us!
2011-09-25T06:15:25  <mcstar> is that sentence grammatically correct?
2011-09-25T06:15:39  <antimatroid> yes (no)
2011-09-25T06:15:49  <antimatroid> i want to say yes, but the answer is no :P
2011-09-25T06:15:53  <antimatroid> is how you should read that
2011-09-25T06:16:10  <mcstar> so its broken for the funny effect of it
2011-09-25T06:16:13  <mcstar> right?
2011-09-25T06:16:16  <mcstar> i can appreciate that
2011-09-25T06:16:23  <antimatroid> i'm not sure where it originally came from, but yeah

2011-09-25T06:16:34  <arlequ1> it comes from an old japanese game
2011-09-25T06:16:46  <antimatroid> that makes sense
2011-09-25T06:16:50  <arlequ1> a shooting game, whom english traduction was horrible
2011-09-25T06:16:50  <mcstar> arlequ1: but its in english
2011-09-25T06:16:57  <mcstar> old japanese people dont know english
2011-09-25T06:17:03  <antimatroid> i love it when translations accidentally the whole thing

2011-09-25T06:19:13  <antimatroid> (i checked online to make sure i found every level :P)

2011-09-25T06:19:46  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Did you saw a Mario AI competition?
2011-09-25T06:19:53  <antimatroid> yeah, i prefer games though
2011-09-25T06:19:58  <mcstar> but its from 1991, not that old, lol
2011-09-25T06:20:03  <antimatroid> 1 player is more of a decision problem than a game
2011-09-25T06:20:35  <antimatroid> i would love to do an ai game with weapons like mario kart
2011-09-25T06:20:38  <antimatroid> that would be sweet
2011-09-25T06:21:40  <mcstar> antimatroid: have you seen battlecode? mleise showed me
2011-09-25T06:21:49  <antimatroid> yeah it's all java :(
2011-09-25T06:21:50  <mcstar> its quite sophisticated, mit does it
2011-09-25T06:22:03  <mcstar> so?
2011-09-25T06:22:10  <antimatroid> some of the planet wars competitors tried to put a team together, not sure if they ever got going
2011-09-25T06:22:22  <antimatroid> i have an irrational hate of java and refuse to touch it, you don't know this? :P
2011-09-25T06:22:24  <mcstar> i guess its a considerably bigger investment
2011-09-25T06:22:41  <mcstar> antimatroid: thats an oximoron
2011-09-25T06:22:51  <antimatroid> what is?
2011-09-25T06:22:53  <mcstar> why do you "touch" c++ regularly?
2011-09-25T06:23:06  <antimatroid> c++ is lovely
2011-09-25T06:23:11  <mcstar> pfff
2011-09-25T06:23:14  <mcstar> they are the same
2011-09-25T06:23:17  <antimatroid> as if
2011-09-25T06:23:24  <antimatroid> c++ has xxx overloading
2011-09-25T06:23:42  <mcstar> lol, you always come with this operator overloading stuff
2011-09-25T06:23:47  <antimatroid> and doesn't require me to remember a bunch of crap just to write a program, like main string blargs
2011-09-25T06:23:48  <mcstar> it matters not, younf padavan
2011-09-25T06:23:51  <mcstar> g*
2011-09-25T06:24:01  <antimatroid> it does when you write stuff that uses operators like matrices
2011-09-25T06:24:24  <mcstar> lets just say, infix notation id broken from the start
2011-09-25T06:24:33  <mcstar> is*
2011-09-25T06:24:37  <antimatroid> compare
2011-09-25T06:24:37  <antimatroid> A = B*(C+D^2)
2011-09-25T06:24:37  <antimatroid> to
2011-09-25T06:24:37  <antimatroid> A = multiply(sum(C, power(D, 2)))
2011-09-25T06:24:59  <mcstar> (* (+ c (^ d 2)))
2011-09-25T06:25:09  <antimatroid> i don't mind infix notation, i wish i could overload pre/in/post fix of an operation and its precedence
2011-09-25T06:25:20  <antimatroid> i'm a mathematician, I want infix :P
2011-09-25T06:25:27  <mcstar> what do you multiple with exactly?
2011-09-25T06:25:52  <mcstar> tiply*
2011-09-25T06:26:10  <antimatroid> multiply what?
2011-09-25T06:26:25  <UncleVasya> I've noticed that not-c++ programmers are mostly loyal for non-their languages. But c++ programmers hate all other languages :)
2011-09-25T06:26:25  <mcstar> multiply(sum(C, power(D, 2)))
2011-09-25T06:26:38  <mcstar> wheres the other term?
2011-09-25T06:26:47  <mcstar> it defaults to identity i guess
2011-09-25T06:26:48  <antimatroid> oh, multiple(A, sum(C, power(D, 2))
2011-09-25T06:26:55  <antimatroid> err, B
2011-09-25T06:26:59  <mcstar> yeah
2011-09-25T06:27:00  <antimatroid> look at my first expression
2011-09-25T06:27:03  <mcstar> i know
2011-09-25T06:27:03  <antimatroid> see, the java way sucks!
2011-09-25T06:27:07  <antimatroid> point proven :P
2011-09-25T06:27:07  <mcstar> im just being
2011-09-25T06:27:10  <mcstar> ____
2011-09-25T06:27:52  <antimatroid> i already have to do A = B*(C^2) because * precedes ^ :(
2011-09-25T06:27:56  <antimatroid> i don't like that
2011-09-25T06:27:59  <mcstar> UncleVasya: they have invested a lot to use that broken thing, so they refuse to think in another language
2011-09-25T06:28:00  <antimatroid> it keeps me up at night :P
2011-09-25T06:29:34  <mcstar> the truth is that i really dont know why are you using c++, i think you would certainly benefit from a more dynamic approach
2011-09-25T06:29:42  <mcstar> i dont want to convert you or anything
2011-09-25T06:30:34  <antimatroid> eventually i expect to move to something like haskell, scheme or lisp but i still prefer c++'s syntax and haven't learnt them yet
2011-09-25T06:30:50  <mcstar> i know that c++ would almost certainly not fit my development style, i only use c/c++ when i NEED to, for example driving the gpu, but otherwise...
2011-09-25T06:31:04  <antimatroid> but i haven't ruled out working in algorithmic trading, so c++ knowledge would be helpful for that
2011-09-25T06:31:40  <mcstar> if you know exactly what you want to code, and you are happy with imperative style, sure

2011-09-25T06:51:39  <mcstar> eashoka: thx for the article
2011-09-25T06:52:01  <mcstar> its always good to read the ranting torvalds
2011-09-25T06:53:24  <antimatroid> linus can lick my balls :P

2011-09-25T06:55:42  <antimatroid> :)
2011-09-25T06:55:50  <mcstar> i would definitely shave them before
2011-09-25T06:56:10  <mcstar> i mean, i dont want him to spit hair
2011-09-25T06:56:41  <mcstar> my life would be totally different if he didnt exist
2011-09-25T06:57:03  <antimatroid> most of my software probably wouldn't exist
2011-09-25T06:57:06  <antimatroid> i'll give him that
2011-09-25T06:57:13  <antimatroid> but there'd be alternatives
2011-09-25T06:57:24  <eashoka> actually I don't like java even though that's the main language I have done most of my stuff. One of these I'm going to learn Lisp and program in proper way.
2011-09-25T06:57:33  <mcstar> you know, i spent soo much time in my first couple of uni. years messing with linux
2011-09-25T06:57:42  <mcstar> i could have been somebodym if linux didnt exist
2011-09-25T06:58:04  <antimatroid> i had to use a command line a bit for uni but not much, only just installed ubuntu earlier this year
2011-09-25T06:58:11  <mcstar> eashoka: why dont you try clojure?
2011-09-25T06:58:17  <antimatroid> so i'm still a bit of a newb, but a newb with a bit of an idea
2011-09-25T06:58:44  <mcstar> antimatroid: linux become much better in recent years
2011-09-25T06:58:55  <eashoka> mcstar : yea I was wondering abt that since you have mentioned it few times now :-) is it a Lisp variant like Arc or ?

2011-09-25T06:59:20  <mcstar> eashoka: it is a Lisp variant
2011-09-25T06:59:30  <mcstar> there are several, common lisp, arc, scheme...
2011-09-25T06:59:53  <mcstar> so its noa compatible lisp with any of the previously existed ones
2011-09-25T06:59:56  <mcstar> not a*
2011-09-25T07:00:21  <mcstar> but that gave rich hickey some space, to design a truly remarkable thing
2011-09-25T07:00:52  <mcstar> and if you already know java, it can only get better
2011-09-25T07:01:00  <mcstar> so go for it
2011-09-25T07:01:34  <eashoka> Arc is Paul Graham's pet isn't it ? I was thinking about giving that a try first but since you have so much praises about clojour.....
2011-09-25T07:01:44  <mcstar> clojure
2011-09-25T07:01:55  <eashoka> :-)
2011-09-25T07:01:58  <mcstar> i letter makes a difference
2011-09-25T07:02:09  <mcstar> several letters, can change the world
2011-09-25T07:02:10  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-25T07:02:14  <mcstar> i->1
2011-09-25T07:02:39  <mcstar> i dont recommend arc
2011-09-25T07:02:41  <mcstar> at all
2011-09-25T07:02:56  <mcstar> if you want something that really can be used, that is common lisp
2011-09-25T07:03:16  <mcstar> has several implementations, they all have a strong point
2011-09-25T07:03:33  <antimatroid> i'm surprised there isn't a linux distro that just has emacs
2011-09-25T07:03:35  <mcstar> if you want scheme i recommend dr.racket
2011-09-25T07:03:37  <antimatroid> like you start up to emacs
2011-09-25T07:04:08  <eashoka> if someone ask you to describe the pluses of clojure (against other Lisp variants) in one sentence, what would that be ?
2011-09-25T07:04:19  <mcstar> i think thats the next step in GNU's evolution
2011-09-25T07:04:24  <mcstar> they aready have a GNU kernel
2011-09-25T07:04:27  <mcstar> the Hurd
2011-09-25T07:04:41  <mcstar> maybe it will come with emacs exclusive mode
2011-09-25T07:04:53  <eashoka> antimatroid : I guess I'm not geek enough to love emacs or vi. I like IntelliJ much better :-)
2011-09-25T07:05:08  <mcstar> eashoka: you should start using emacs right away
2011-09-25T07:05:20  <mcstar> even more so if you want to have anything to do with a lisp
2011-09-25T07:06:10  <antimatroid> eashoka: i don't use either myself :P but it would be funny
2011-09-25T07:06:33  <mcstar> answer: clojure is one of the most recent lisps, and has a unique, and distilled perspective, and fits well with java
2011-09-25T07:06:40  <mcstar> you really cannot go wrong
2011-09-25T07:07:00  <antimatroid> eashoka: are you still mistaking clojure as an operating system? it's a programming language
2011-09-25T07:07:05  <antimatroid> or am i retarded?
2011-09-25T07:07:08  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-25T07:07:15  <mcstar> he knows what clojure is
2011-09-25T07:07:56  <antimatroid> i thought he was mistaking it as an os :P i'll shhh up
2011-09-25T07:08:09  <eashoka> mcstar : that's a pretty convincing one liner. u should be in the marketing business
2011-09-25T07:08:28  <mcstar> lol
2011-09-25T07:08:37  <mcstar> i hate money
2011-09-25T07:09:44  <eashoka> antimatroid : I have permanently switched from windows to Ubuntu about a year back and have no intentions going back. However the one I most liked was mac OS but I don't have a macbook anymore.
2011-09-25T07:10:18  <mcstar> eashoka: i was in noman's land too for quite some time
2011-09-25T07:10:25  <antimatroid> i didn't like mac, but i only ever had locked down ibooks from year 7-12
2011-09-25T07:10:26  <mcstar> until i decided i could live without windows
2011-09-25T07:10:33  <mcstar> its really a terrible experience
2011-09-25T07:11:35  <eashoka> mcstar : no man's :-)

2011-09-25T07:12:05  <mcstar> so i abandoned that too
2011-09-25T07:12:12  <eashoka> yea life is too short to waste on windows.
2011-09-25T07:12:21  <mcstar> (i could have been characterized as an os nerd)
2011-09-25T07:12:35  <mcstar> i tried beos too
2011-09-25T07:12:57  <mcstar> i was on the quest to find the perfect os
2011-09-25T07:13:03  <mcstar> (sooo stupid, looking back)
2011-09-25T07:13:29  <antimatroid> haters gonna hate, i really liked xp
2011-09-25T07:13:38  <antimatroid> </3 for vista and 7 though
2011-09-25T07:13:51  <antimatroid> they ruined minesweeper for starters, that's just not acceptable
2011-09-25T07:13:58  <eashoka> mac OS is pretty neat(when they come with proper hardware)  actually and so are the new line of desktops and macbooks.

2011-09-25T07:16:05  <antimatroid> i only own a desktop :P
2011-09-25T07:16:05  <mcstar> its a browser based
2011-09-25T07:16:20  <antimatroid> i don't even own a mobile phone :P
2011-09-25T07:16:26  <mcstar> anyway, it surely sucks
2011-09-25T07:16:27  <antimatroid> been without one of those for like 2.5 years
2011-09-25T07:16:43  <eashoka> animatroid : that's a bliss :-)
2011-09-25T07:16:49  <mcstar> thats bs.
2011-09-25T07:17:07  <eashoka> I wish I can stay w/o a mobile phone :-)
2011-09-25T07:17:22  <mcstar> i certainly dont use it, but i couldnt live withoout it
2011-09-25T07:17:33  <eashoka> me neither
2011-09-25T07:17:44  <mcstar> i want the possibility to call anyone at any time, even if i dont do it
2011-09-25T07:18:03  <mcstar> and of course noone can call me, cause its constantly turned off
2011-09-25T07:19:34  <mcstar> anyway, when someone starts to use its pc for work, or to get things done, he realizes that only one os can live up to that
2011-09-25T07:20:25  <mcstar> one thing, that im really proud of, is that i stopped looking for better looking gui, and im satisfied with minimal theming and a tiling wm now
2011-09-25T07:20:41  <mcstar> since april, this year i think
2011-09-25T07:20:48  <mcstar> its a big achievment for me
2011-09-25T07:21:05  <mcstar> its like quiting drinking

2011-09-25T07:23:18  <antimatroid> doubly continuous tense what?
2011-09-25T07:23:25  <antimatroid> i hate lots of gui stuff, it's awful
2011-09-25T07:23:37  <antimatroid> i had xp on windows classic always
2011-09-25T07:23:57  <mcstar> is "quiting drinking" correct?
2011-09-25T07:24:03  <mcstar> it sounds wrongful

2011-09-25T10:38:47  <jbroman> One thing I don't like about Python is that I want to have one class per file, but in Python that causes it to have its own module, which I don't want.
2011-09-25T10:39:10  <jbroman> Is there some non-hack way to avoid this, or is one file per module the Python way? (Pretty sure it's the latter.)
2011-09-25T10:39:24  <jbroman> I don't want to import myorg.mymodule.mysubmodule.myclass.MyClass.
2011-09-25T10:40:09  <jbroman> And yeah, I know about using __init__.py, but that seems like the wrong thing to do. Mmm.

2011-09-25T10:44:15  <mcstar> what do you expect from a language where you have to use self. to access the current class's namespace?
2011-09-25T10:44:48  <antimatroid> i don't know python well which probably helps my opinion, but i think it's crappy
2011-09-25T10:45:02  <antimatroid> it does make programming easy, but i don't like it :P
2011-09-25T10:45:50  <mcstar> antimatroid: did you read what strawsoup said of c++?
2011-09-25T10:47:59  <jbroman> I kind of want to use Java, but I might end up regretting that as well.
2011-09-25T10:49:13  <mcstar> jbroman: for what?
2011-09-25T10:50:30  <jbroman> mcstar: Heh. Poking at Zeta again. I want to do things that I'm used to doing in Java.
2011-09-25T10:50:51  <jbroman> But I'm sure even with my own concerns aside, using Java for that would make some unhappy, so I won't.
2011-09-25T10:51:34  <antimatroid> mcstar: yeah i read most of it
2011-09-25T10:51:48  <antimatroid> sorry, been busy doing topology and ring theory assignments :\
2011-09-25T10:51:59  <mcstar> antimatroid: its weird and funny

2011-09-25T10:52:23  <patrisk> I can't stand 'elif'
2011-09-25T10:52:28  <patrisk> Just use 'else if' goddamnit!
2011-09-25T10:52:42  <mcstar> patrisk: why not use cond?
2011-09-25T10:52:52  <patrisk> cond?
2011-09-25T10:52:54  <antimatroid> "If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution" :D
2011-09-25T10:53:01  <mcstar> yes, its the only sane conditional
2011-09-25T10:53:13  <mcstar> good one :D
2011-09-25T10:53:15  <patrisk> I'm very new to python so I don't know what cond is

2011-09-25T10:53:27  <patrisk> I thought so
2011-09-25T10:53:39  <mcstar> i mentioned the word "sane"
2011-09-25T10:53:45  <patrisk> Wasn't sure if python had stolen it or something
2011-09-25T10:53:51  <mcstar> so it must be clear that im talking about lisp
2011-09-25T10:53:55  <jbroman> mcstar: ))))))))))))))))))))))
2011-09-25T10:53:57  <jbroman> Am I sane yet?
2011-09-25T10:54:12  <mcstar> one good choice all it takes
2011-09-25T10:54:22  <patrisk> That's terrible, jbroman, it's not even iterative
2011-09-25T10:55:16  <mcstar> jbroman: parens are the best part
2011-09-25T10:55:41  <mcstar> i used python for a couple of days this week
2011-09-25T10:55:51  <mcstar> i had trouble matching parens
2011-09-25T10:56:17  <mcstar> im used to slime/emacs, it highlights parens very well, and the python editor didnt
2011-09-25T10:56:44  <mcstar> and its harder to match python parens than lisp's
2011-09-25T10:56:47  <jbroman> That's a shortcoming of the editor, not the language.
2011-09-25T10:57:03  <mcstar> no, i can better match lisp parens even if it isnt highlighted
2011-09-25T10:57:20  <jbroman> Also, in Python you should not end up with more than, oh, three levels of parentheses on a regular basis.
2011-09-25T10:57:35  <jbroman> (Exceptions for certain problem domains.)
2011-09-25T10:57:44  <mcstar> for example function calls
2011-09-25T10:57:59  <mcstar> thats a "problem doamin" with many parens
2011-09-25T10:57:59  <jbroman> Yeah, but you shouldn't be nesting function calls that deep in my humble opinion.
2011-09-25T10:58:03  <jbroman> That's what variables are for.
2011-09-25T10:58:07  <mcstar> pfff
2011-09-25T10:58:11  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-25T10:58:23  <mcstar> i want nameless variables
2011-09-25T10:58:33  <mcstar> lambda-variables lol
2011-09-25T10:58:34  <jbroman> foo(bar(baz(4+(2*4), 5), qux(a)))
2011-09-25T10:59:06  <jbroman> This is about the limit. Naming things gives you clarity anyways.
2011-09-25T10:59:28  <jbroman> Java believes this a little too much, so that you get to name things four or five times.
2011-09-25T10:59:50  <mcstar> im not sure how
2011-09-25T10:59:59  <jbroman> how to which?
2011-09-25T11:00:12  <mcstar> how can one name things four or five times?
2011-09-25T11:00:25  <jbroman> mcstar: I mean repeating the name a lot. Hold on, example forthcoming.

2011-09-25T11:05:39  <mcstar> so its a class that initializes its variables?
2011-09-25T11:05:52  <jbroman> mcstar: Imagine some useful methods defined below.
2011-09-25T11:06:02  <jbroman> The constructor simple initializes its instance variables.
2011-09-25T11:07:47  <mcstar> (make-instance 'repetition :banana-factory banana-factory)
2011-09-25T11:08:16  <mcstar> of course you need a class definition which i wont provide here
2011-09-25T11:09:27  <mcstar> i guess it wasnt a bad choice to write the contest's framework in python
2011-09-25T11:09:58  <jbroman> The nice thing about Java is the ability to strictly define discrete components and the interfaces between them.
2011-09-25T11:10:07  <mcstar> but from what you said, it seems you have a bad feeling about this
2011-09-25T11:10:10  <jbroman> Python doesn't enforce that sort of thing, so you must assume the programmers will.
2011-09-25T11:10:34  <jbroman> This may be due, in part, to my Java-indoctrination at my employer. But I do see the benefits of it.
2011-09-25T11:10:59  <mcstar> yeah, well i dont even know what those can be

2011-09-25T11:11:15  <mcstar> "component interfaces"
2011-09-25T11:11:23  <jbroman> A large system has parts.
2011-09-25T11:11:30  <jbroman> You define how the parts must interact.
2011-09-25T11:11:45  <jbroman> Then you can worry about implementing each part without worrying about the implementation of each other part.
2011-09-25T11:11:46  <mcstar> i guess i know what you mean,  just dont know why would it be different in java tna in python
2011-09-25T11:11:54  <jbroman> Strong typing, mostly.
2011-09-25T11:11:58  <mcstar> from my perspective these languages are all the same
2011-09-25T11:12:21  <jbroman> Java will ensure that you cannot possibly put the wrong thing somewhere, call a method that isn't appropriate, etc.
2011-09-25T11:12:28  <jbroman> Python will not (until runtime, maybe).
2011-09-25T11:12:55  <jbroman> This does make Python easier to develop quickly in, but at scale it can cause problems if the developers are not in sync with one another.
2011-09-25T11:13:28  <jbroman> It's harder to know what you can change without breaking other things.
2011-09-25T11:13:33  <mcstar> so you basically saying you lack a compiler?
2011-09-25T11:13:40  <mcstar> that does these checks before runtime?
2011-09-25T11:13:53  <jbroman> Yeah, Python doesn't provide the information necessary to do this kind of static analysis.
2011-09-25T11:14:02  <jbroman> (Which is typically done at compile time, but need not be.)
2011-09-25T11:14:24  <jbroman> Unit tests help, but they are not the same thing exactly.
2011-09-25T11:14:28  <mcstar> what about keyword arguemnts, and documenting them?
2011-09-25T11:14:56  <jbroman> I'm not denying that you can accomplish any task with Python that you can with Java, or C#, or C, or …
2011-09-25T11:15:00  <mcstar> (i just realized this week, that i cant assign variables in a funtion call)
2011-09-25T11:15:03  <jbroman> But documentation often falls out of date.
2011-09-25T11:15:04  <mcstar> fun(a=b)
2011-09-25T11:15:34  <jbroman> Whereas the compiler always knows what the code actually requires, as opposed to what it required a year ago.
2011-09-25T11:15:53  <mcstar> that doesnt guarantee any more correctness
2011-09-25T11:16:07  <mcstar> it just filters obvious errors
2011-09-25T11:16:07  <jbroman> It doesn't guarantee absolute correctness, but it helps.
2011-09-25T11:16:38  <mcstar> i think after you work for some time with a dynamic type system, you get used to it
2011-09-25T11:16:45  <jbroman> I *have*.
2011-09-25T11:16:50  <jbroman> I've written much more Ruby than I have Java.
2011-09-25T11:16:50  <mcstar> but thats mostly bs from my part
2011-09-25T11:16:57  <jbroman> You can absolutely get stuff done in both.
2011-09-25T11:17:10  <jbroman> I'm just saying that strong typing isn't the slavedriver some make it out to be.
2011-09-25T11:17:15  <mcstar> so? do you make more errors in ruby regularly than in java?
2011-09-25T11:17:45  <jbroman> I make errors more frequently in Java (mostly newbie stuff), but I find that the compiler catches a lot of them right away.
2011-09-25T11:18:26  <jbroman> The existence of interfaces, for instance, helps solidify which methods should be called in a particular use case, and which should be left as implementation details.
2011-09-25T11:18:42  <mcstar> now imagine how hard was it for me to learn common lisp, which obviously has a dynamic type system, with a broken debugger(basically empty backtrces)
2011-09-25T11:19:36  <mcstar> so "interfaces" are just calling conventions
2011-09-25T11:19:45  <jbroman> Yeah.
2011-09-25T11:19:50  <mcstar> fancy word for it
2011-09-25T11:19:52  <jbroman> They define the set of methods you can call on some class.
2011-09-25T11:20:26  <mcstar> clojure has a nice method dispatch system, which meant to improve even on CLOS
2011-09-25T11:20:45  <mcstar> (i only heard about it)

2011-09-25T11:54:29  <mcstar> jbroman: why are you using zsh?
2011-09-25T12:02:00  <jbroman> mcstar: Because it's nice, and I like some of its features?
2011-09-25T12:02:12  <jbroman> Mostly the same as bash, but there are some things I'm used to.
2011-09-25T12:02:22  <jbroman> Like expanding /u/l/b[tab] to /usr/local/bin
2011-09-25T12:03:01  <mcstar> thats why im asking, if its better or something
2011-09-25T12:03:15  <jbroman> I think there are articles with more detail.
2011-09-25T12:03:32  <jbroman> I also have a right prompt and some extra completion set up, but I think that's available in bash, too.
2011-09-25T12:03:46  <mcstar> well, you are using it, and its not the default shell, so i thought you can give me the bigger highlights
2011-09-25T12:03:50  <jbroman> Oh, variables are automatically available as named directories.
2011-09-25T12:04:08  <jbroman> So I have dev=~/Development, so I can use ~dev instead.
2011-09-25T12:04:32  <jbroman> Not completely different from just using $dev, but the shell prompt abbreviates it like that as well.
2011-09-25T12:04:51  <jbroman> Um…I don't think bash has deep globbing either.
2011-09-25T12:04:59  <jbroman> rm **/*.log and such
2011-09-25T12:05:06  <mcstar> so pwd gives you ~dev/stuff
2011-09-25T12:05:35  <mcstar> i have to look up globbing
2011-09-25T12:05:41  <jbroman> pwd gives you full path, but the shell prompt gives you ~dev/stuff, in the same way it would say ~/Pictures instead of /Users/jeremy/Pictures

2011-09-25T12:06:05  <jbroman> I think it also does some array variable stuff bash doesn't.
2011-09-25T12:06:25  <mcstar> bash has arrays, i used them before
2011-09-25T12:08:22  <jbroman> Also implicit cd can be nice.
2011-09-25T12:08:33  <mcstar> whats that?
2011-09-25T12:08:36  <jbroman> If you just give the name of a directory without a command, it acts as if you used cd.
2011-09-25T12:08:46  <jbroman> Kinda nice shortcut on occasion, not that "cd" is that long to type.
2011-09-25T12:08:57  <mcstar> i have .. for cd ..
2011-09-25T12:09:16  <jbroman> Yeah, zsh does that implicitly for all paths (unless they would normally run a valid command)
2011-09-25T12:09:39  <jbroman> well, if you setopt AUTO_CD it does.
2011-09-25T12:09:53  <jbroman> Also, if you setopt CORRECT it will try and fix slightly mistyped commands.
2011-09-25T12:10:07  <jbroman> So if I try to run "whomi", I get:
2011-09-25T12:10:11  <jbroman> zsh: correct 'whomi' to 'whoami' [nyae]?
2011-09-25T12:10:23  <mcstar> that doesnt help me learn correct touctyping :)

2011-09-25T12:23:40  <mcstar> why an earth can an ssh connection become crawling slow?
2011-09-25T12:23:53  <amstan> mcstar: yeah, i hate those too
2011-09-25T12:24:06  <amstan> mcstar: usually the problem is the reverse dns lookups that happen when you connect
2011-09-25T12:24:11  <amstan> the only reason it does that is for logging
2011-09-25T12:24:14  <amstan> you can disable it

2011-09-25T12:25:00  <mcstar> sometimes they are soo slow, that i cant edit a file
2011-09-25T12:25:16  <amstan> crappy network connection maybe?
2011-09-25T12:25:18  <mcstar> this happens with a couple 2-3 machines at work
2011-09-25T12:25:38  <mcstar> when im in the institute, on the 100MB network it still happens
2011-09-25T12:25:43  <amstan> high cpu usage on either host might also do it
2011-09-25T12:25:51  <mcstar> no, 8 cores, no utilization
2011-09-25T12:26:06  <amstan> idk
2011-09-25T12:26:09  <mcstar> and resatrt doesnt help it
2011-09-25T12:26:12  <mcstar> yeah idk either
2011-09-25T12:26:25  <mcstar> its centos 6 btw
2011-09-25T12:26:34  <mcstar> but i not sure how is that relevant
2011-09-25T12:26:56  <mcstar> i suspect a faulty router in the middle somewhere

2011-09-25T18:03:32  <olexs> so basically, the game's being changed before the challenge goes live?

2011-09-25T18:05:36  <janzert> queen would be the natural name although not quite completely realistic ;)
2011-09-25T18:06:24  <_flag> Wait, what are these "hills"?
2011-09-25T18:07:40  <olexs> points on a map belonging to a player that spawn ants, it would seem. the game's target is to destroy enemies' hills... makes the whole thing much closer to more "classic" strategy games
2011-09-25T18:08:07  <_flag> So the game is being changed completely? Or is this a different game?
2011-09-25T18:08:26  <olexs> my guess is a change from the beta, so that beta players have less of an advantage
2011-09-25T18:08:49  <_flag> What about all the starter packs, etc.?
2011-09-25T18:09:12  <McLeopold> it sure would help us if you fixed the c ones :)
2011-09-25T18:09:19  <janzert> it's a very small change from the perspective of a starter bot :)
2011-09-25T18:09:49  <olexs> does the food-based ant spawning stay or is it hills only now?
2011-09-25T18:10:07  <_flag> Uhh...
2011-09-25T18:10:08  <janzert> I would almost say a correctly written starter bot should run unmodified
2011-09-25T18:10:18  <McLeopold> they do
2011-09-25T18:10:43  <_flag> So what role does food play now?

2011-09-25T18:15:01  <janzert> I mean the os level accounts
2011-09-25T18:15:05  <McLeopold> or do we do that at launch?

2011-09-25T18:18:01  <McLeopold> olexs: no, I need to update that one
2011-09-25T18:18:13  <olexs> problem description is rather vague, too
2011-09-25T18:18:24  <olexs> but I hope that'll be fixed in time :)

2011-09-25T18:18:42  <janzert> oops, got a few more settings need added to server_info
2011-09-25T18:18:57  <McLeopold> janzert: did you bring the data over?
2011-09-25T18:19:12  <_flag> Is this still a beta server, or is this the final one?
2011-09-25T18:19:25  <janzert> nope
2011-09-25T18:19:32  <McLeopold> okay, that's fine
2011-09-25T18:19:46  <janzert> I can still get it if needed though
2011-09-25T18:20:09  <xathis> woah that came unexpected
2011-09-25T18:20:20  <olexs> _flag: it looks like the admins are busy. I'd let them finish their thing and wait for a forum announcement... not much more we can do, it seems.
2011-09-25T18:20:55  <McLeopold> olexs: actually, as I write the specs this week, you can help me make sure they are acurate
2011-09-25T18:21:24  <olexs> McLeopold: I'd be glad to help
2011-09-25T18:23:04  <janzert> ok, confirmation emails should be working again

2011-09-25T18:23:26  <janzert> right
2011-09-25T18:23:30  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-25T18:23:35  <McLeopold> made it just in time :)
2011-09-25T18:24:03  <janzert> yeah, creating an account for myself is what tipped me off
2011-09-25T18:24:20  <janzert> ready for workers?
2011-09-25T18:24:24  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-25T18:24:31  <McLeopold> we have no maps, nor submissions

2011-09-25T18:24:45  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-25T18:24:55  <McLeopold> I didn't add them *headslap*
2011-09-25T18:25:31  <mleise> That's the chaos I was looking for :D

2011-09-25T18:25:37  <olexs> I just wanted to say, running play_one_game to see the changes
2011-09-25T18:25:42  <olexs> "where are the maps gone"
2011-09-25T18:26:30  <olexs> riiiiiight
2011-09-25T18:27:02  <olexs> so no more ants spawning where food was, but ants spawning at hills after food gets collected
2011-09-25T18:27:40  <McLeopold> okay, maps are in

2011-09-25T18:28:35  <janzert> now we just need a few people to submit something ;)
2011-09-25T18:28:44  <janzert> ok
2011-09-25T18:28:45  <McLeopold> submit greedy bot
2011-09-25T18:28:49  <McLeopold> it will work
2011-09-25T18:28:54  <McLeopold> but it can't path find
2011-09-25T18:29:12  <olexs> should I submit my bot? it should work
2011-09-25T18:29:25  <xathis> will it be mazes only or will we get maps similar to the old ones?
2011-09-25T18:29:30  <janzert> hmm, add_maps script needs to be modified to set the map timestamp
2011-09-25T18:30:14  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-25T18:30:26  <McLeopold> I'm redoing the whole thing today
2011-09-25T18:30:32  <McLeopold> the first maps were done by hand

2011-09-25T18:31:42  <McLeopold> are the workers going?
2011-09-25T18:32:02  <janzert> didn't start them yet, no
2011-09-25T18:32:07  <janzert> ready now?
2011-09-25T18:32:12  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-25T18:32:14  <janzert> I'll just start one for now
2011-09-25T18:32:26  <McLeopold> xathis: we will try to include as many map types as possible
2011-09-25T18:33:00  <xathis> McLeopold: okay that's good
2011-09-25T18:33:06  <janzert> I think very open maps may work out better with this than before too
2011-09-25T18:35:42  <janzert> would probably be a good idea for someone to make some sort of announcement of the change on the forums
2011-09-25T18:36:48  <mleise> janzert: if there is an update script, could the "update_visualizer.sh" from my home dir be integrated? it builds the tools.zip package.
2011-09-25T18:38:35  <janzert> want to check it into the setup/ directory?
2011-09-25T18:39:03  <janzert> or is it only on the last server? I can grab it if so
2011-09-25T18:39:16  <mleise> ok, the path /home/contest/... is fixed
2011-09-25T18:39:36  <janzert> there isn't any overall update script
2011-09-25T18:39:40  <mleise> let me check it in, i have a copy
2011-09-25T18:40:03  <janzert> just the initial setup script and a few to update things the workers pull off
2011-09-25T18:40:38  <McLeopold> how long till we have workers?
2011-09-25T18:41:52  <janzert> the worker booted up about 4 minutes ago, so probably should be active in about 6-8 more minutes

2011-09-25T18:48:07  <janzert> looks like the worker is active, both submissions compiled successfully

2011-09-25T18:52:52  <janzert> McLeopold: looks like the worker is getting blank tasks (task: '')
2011-09-25T18:53:46  <janzert> and game_list.php has an undefined variable error
2011-09-25T18:56:24  <olexs> weren't the games only played on symmetrical maps before? now you only have mazes, maybe that's got to do with it
2011-09-25T18:57:34  <janzert> possibly but it doesn't look like it's even getting to the point of looking at a map
2011-09-25T18:58:37  <janzert> php_api.log is showing a "trying to reset mysql..." line each time the worker requests a task
2011-09-25T19:02:48  <janzert> think I see the problem
2011-09-25T19:03:16  <janzert> worker_id = 0 and there is a check for worker_id > 0
2011-09-25T19:03:55  <janzert> ugh, actually now I seem to remember other code that treats worker_id 0 as special
2011-09-25T19:05:31  <janzert> hmm, no the worker_id of the current worker is 1
2011-09-25T19:10:12  <janzert> "call generate_matchup" is failing with "ERROR 1048 (23000): Column 'submission_id' cannot be null"
2011-09-25T19:10:25  <janzert> but I have no idea how to debug where in that function it is occuring

2011-09-25T19:23:17  <janzert> so I think that error may be occuring because all players are already in matchups
2011-09-25T19:24:22  <McLeopold> should the first matchup proceed?
2011-09-25T19:24:39  <McLeopold> oh, worker_id 0, that isn't good
2011-09-25T19:24:42  <janzert> well, same error after clearing the matchup table
2011-09-25T19:24:51  <janzert> see the log

2011-09-25T19:25:04  <McLeopold> 1 worker? can you pause it?
2011-09-25T19:25:08  <janzert> it is
2011-09-25T19:25:20  <McLeopold> did try and play a game or not?
2011-09-25T19:25:49  <janzert> I don't think it has received a game task yet
2011-09-25T19:26:03  <McLeopold> the matchup worker_id isn't being set to null
2011-09-25T19:26:07  <McLeopold> I'll look at it...
2011-09-25T19:26:16  <janzert> right the call to generate_matchup is failing

2011-09-25T19:47:50  <janzert> I was wondering about that, rather than outright exclusion shouldn't it just make them least desirable?
2011-09-25T19:48:17  <janzert> or is it simply much harder and normally never run into
2011-09-25T19:49:03  <McLeopold> I'm on the fence
2011-09-25T19:49:23  <McLeopold> I was thinking I would move the exclusion out and do a retry
2011-09-25T19:50:12  <McLeopold> the problem was with 10 people currently in a matchup, the 10 closest to someone with exclusions could become the 10-20 closest
2011-09-25T19:51:06  <McLeopold> I think I will drop it and try and include current matchups in the game counts.
2011-09-25T19:51:36  <McLeopold> I may still put in no repeat logic...
2011-09-25T19:51:59  <McLeopold> but then a 3 player game with 2 users will halt the system :)

2011-09-25T19:55:23  <janzert> yeah, it's an edge condition that should probably never be hit after the start of the contest.
2011-09-25T19:59:16  <McLeopold> I accounted for it before the big switch, and knew this might come up again :(

2011-09-25T22:36:26  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I read the commentary on issue #194 that you marked issue #257 as a duplicate of. In the last comment you said the next game time prediction works "good enough". Before the server reset I would consistently see a prediction of 30 minutes to my next game and with one exception it always ended up being about an hour in reality. That seems pretty far off to me. Plus when I got near the top of the queue the time remaining w
2011-09-25T22:37:24  <ChrisH> It just seemed very misleading.
2011-09-25T22:37:58  <McLeopold> I can just double it?
2011-09-25T22:38:15  <ChrisH> Maybe, but then the negative numbers would be worse. ;)
2011-09-25T22:38:39  <ChrisH> Or you could just take it off and leave the number of players ahead of you in the queue.
2011-09-25T22:38:47  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-09-25T22:38:50  <McLeopold> I could do that
2011-09-25T22:39:23  <ChrisH> Until the time stuff gets some attention, otherwise it is not confidence building.
2011-09-25T22:40:24  <ChrisH> Either way, I'm looking forward to the contest getting underway for real. Thanks for all the hard work!
2011-09-25T22:41:22  <McLeopold> Well, the problem is, we know who is ahead of you, but we don't know how many will be pulled into other games
2011-09-25T22:41:50  <ChrisH> Yeah, from what I gather about the scheduling algorithm that makes sense.
2011-09-25T22:42:17  <McLeopold> So, I could assume the worst, or the best or average, but I just don't care enough to solve the problem.
2011-09-25T22:42:25  <McLeopold> So I might just remove it
2011-09-25T22:42:26  <ChrisH> But at least the number ahead in the queue is always positive and doesn't over promise.
2011-09-25T22:42:46  <McLeopold> I forget why I subtracted stuff... I think it was for games in progress
2011-09-25T22:44:19  <ChrisH> I think my account was among the worst because I was making new submissions all the time, and most others in my ranking region were not, so my bot wasn't going to add a lot of new info to other games and I didn't get pulled in to other games.
2011-09-25T22:45:46  <McLeopold> The other problem is, we don't always know how many players per game
2011-09-25T22:46:04  <ChrisH> I sympathize, though, because I've developed a bit of code that solves a similar problem (scheduling contests to determine an overall ranking), but I didn't have as strong of a constraint on trying to get regular contests for the particpants.
2011-09-25T22:47:21  <ChrisH> My particpants weren't a proxy for real people, so I wasn't going to hurt anyone's feelings.

2011-09-25T23:31:04  <janzert> McLeopold: seems the food cutoff is too quick http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=17&user=4
2011-09-25T23:31:05  <McLeopold> janzert: vb bot failed :(
2011-09-25T23:31:07  <ChrisH> janzert: True.  Also, it looks like this is true even in games where a bot is dead and the hill is captured. So I'm filing a more broad issue.
2011-09-25T23:31:16  <janzert> at least for this map type
2011-09-25T23:31:36  <McLeopold> janzert: up it to 80% for 150 turns?
2011-09-25T23:31:51  <janzert> what is it now?
2011-09-25T23:32:15  <McLeopold> ooh, 90% for 100
2011-09-25T23:32:23  <janzert> that's what I thought
2011-09-25T23:32:37  <McLeopold> oh and the location is antsbeta.janzert
2011-09-25T23:32:43  <janzert> the problem is the mazes can make the food effectively really far away
2011-09-25T23:32:53  <McLeopold> yeah...
2011-09-25T23:33:18  <McLeopold> I need to go, if you think of a better metric, let me know
2011-09-25T23:33:29  <janzert> I guess for now just bump it to 150 moves maybe
2011-09-25T23:33:34  <janzert> or I can
2011-09-25T23:33:52  <_flag> I noticed in this game I came first despite losing all my ants: http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=16
2011-09-25T23:34:05  <_flag> Does that mean if I know I'm leading I can just suicide everything and win?
2011-09-25T23:34:18  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-09-25T23:34:23  <janzert> yeah you could
2011-09-25T23:34:27  <_flag> ;/
2011-09-25T23:34:51  <McLeopold> oh, janzert, I forgot last man standing gets the points
2011-09-25T23:34:52  <janzert> if the ranks can no longer change the game is ended early
2011-09-25T23:34:57  <janzert> at least I'm pretty sure
2011-09-25T23:35:15  <janzert> the rest of the hills right?
2011-09-25T23:35:28  <McLeopold> _flag: so, if you suicide so that only one bot is left, he get's the points for killing all remaining hills
2011-09-25T23:35:42  <McLeopold> as soon as I code it :)
2011-09-25T23:36:24  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@97-126-15-74.tukw.qwest.net> has left #aichallenge
2011-09-25T23:36:24  <_flag> McLeopold: Okay I see :), how long do you plan on waiting for another bot to win?
2011-09-25T23:36:46  <janzert> ?
2011-09-25T23:37:15  <janzert> we need to know not just the winner of the game but the actual order of ranking
2011-09-25T23:37:17  <_flag> Is that question mark directed at my question or him leaving?
2011-09-25T23:37:24  <janzert> at your question
2011-09-25T23:37:43  <janzert> once the order is unchangeable then the game can be ended
2011-09-25T23:38:21  <ChrisH> How are the ranks determined in the new game?
2011-09-25T23:38:22  <_flag> Well I interpreted what he was saying as: If I were to suicide everything so only one bot is left when I knew I was winning, the game would wait for the other bot to capture my hills
2011-09-25T23:38:40  <_flag> In which case, how long would it wait?
2011-09-25T23:38:54  <janzert> no, if only one active bot is left it is automatically given all the remaining hills and the game is ended immediately
2011-09-25T23:39:17  <_flag> Then why was I tied for first in this game: http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=16 ?
2011-09-25T23:39:51  <janzert> heh, I would say because the engine has a bug
2011-09-25T23:40:03  <_flag> Okay, that explains it
2011-09-25T23:40:04  <janzert> the game was ended but eashoka didn't get the points for your hill
2011-09-25T23:43:18  *** delt0r_ <delt0r_!~bob@93-82-139-65.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-25T23:44:54  <janzert> ChrisH: The score currently is 2 points per hill you destroy and 1 point for your own hill that you protect
2011-09-25T23:45:56  <janzert> well, except the engine seems to have implemented it currently as -1 point to you when your hill is destroyed but that should work out the same
2011-09-25T23:46:00  <ChrisH> janzert: Interesting, the ants are worthless except as a means to an end. It will be interesting to see how strategies develop, but it seems like there are going to be a lot of ties.
2011-09-25T23:46:15  <janzert> yes, draws are probably more likely
