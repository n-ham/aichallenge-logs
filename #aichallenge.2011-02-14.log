2011-02-14T00:31:01  <antimatroid> hmmm i once read somewhere that if i had a destructor or copy function in c++ i strictly had to declare the other one
2011-02-14T00:31:10  <antimatroid> but now i can't find anywhere saying such a thing, is that true?
2011-02-14T00:41:16  <jbroman> antimatroid: Not required insofar as the compiler needs, it but insofar as it is a "good idea" in most cases.

2011-02-14T16:21:27  <flag> keep in mind it takes the entire map as input every turn, not just the updates
2011-02-14T16:27:52  <McLeopold> flag: I'm looking to organize starter bots
2011-02-14T16:28:32  <McLeopold> Maybe we should create a simple starter bot algo?
2011-02-14T16:29:07  <flag> sure
2011-02-14T16:29:47  <flag> I was planning on adding distance and tracking of individual ants (this one just reorders them based on the order they're found on the map every time)
2011-02-14T16:30:54  <McLeopold> I'm thinking a starter bot should be Hunter Bot.
2011-02-14T16:31:11  <flag> The algo I wrote in YourCode.c is supposed to make an ant  follow a wall but with a different initial direction based on its ant id
2011-02-14T16:31:14  <McLeopold> I realize this is different from your actual bot.
2011-02-14T16:31:30  <McLeopold> That's what LeftyBot does. :)
2011-02-14T16:31:35  <flag> ah
2011-02-14T16:31:47  <McLeopold> it's a horrible design, probably
2011-02-14T16:32:01  <flag> Well as a starter pack it isn't too bad I suppose
2011-02-14T16:32:06  <McLeopold> they kept hitting each other and then going in circles
2011-02-14T16:32:30  <McLeopold> I figure a wall hugging bot ought to be an example bot.
2011-02-14T16:32:42  <flag> Obviously a real solution would have the ants actively trying to collect food and attack enemies, but for an example bot it should be fine
2011-02-14T16:33:18  <McLeopold> So, each starter pack should come with a "MyBot" file
2011-02-14T16:33:39  <McLeopold> In some languages there will be an ants class file along with it
2011-02-14T16:34:12  <McLeopold> So, aside from getting input and sending output, I think each starter pack needs to functions
2011-02-14T16:34:20  <McLeopold> get_distance and get_direction
2011-02-14T16:34:35  <McLeopold> that way people can see how to code for the map wrapping around
2011-02-14T16:35:00  <flag> sounds good
2011-02-14T16:35:22  <McLeopold> Anything else would be too much, so no pathfinding in the starter packs
2011-02-14T16:35:57  <McLeopold> But, we should also include the logic not to send 2 ants to the same spot, so they can see that as well.
2011-02-14T16:36:26  <flag> Probably best to add this to the wiki
2011-02-14T16:36:40  <flag> Under something like "starter pack guidelines"
2011-02-14T16:39:48  <McLeopold> Yeah, I should

2011-02-14T20:24:02  <antimatroid> i'm thinking about intuition
2011-02-14T20:27:12  <pyro-> you can make it so you must stand on a food to eat it antimatroid ?
2011-02-14T20:30:03  <antimatroid> doesn't work
2011-02-14T20:30:09  <antimatroid> that square needs to become an ant
2011-02-14T20:30:24  <antimatroid> if spawn radius was <2 it'd be blocked be walls
2011-02-14T20:30:27  <antimatroid> i want that anyway
2011-02-14T20:31:22  <antimatroid> i want spawn radius = 1, battle radius = rt5
2011-02-14T20:31:32  <antimatroid> <=2*
