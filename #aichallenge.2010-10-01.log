2010-10-01T02:36:13  <antimatroid2> yeah
2010-10-01T02:36:29  <antimatroid2> but is that the bottom right being wrong or the actual engine handing the wrong person the win?
2010-10-01T02:36:40  <antimatroid2> i assume it's the error message being wrong
2010-10-01T02:37:58  <sigh> I can't imagine the visualizer getting data from anywhere but what the engine says
2010-10-01T02:38:15  <sigh> so visualizer must be wrong
2010-10-01T02:38:19  <antimatroid2> it's really really bad if the engine is getting the winner wrong
2010-10-01T02:38:28  <antimatroid2> not so bad if the visualiser fucks up
2010-10-01T02:39:06  <sigh> the winner and loser are in the "var data" in javascript, but the visualiser was not displaying the correct winner
2010-10-01T02:39:41  <antimatroid2> okay sure, but it even says on my profile that i won a game i assume i lost

2010-10-01T03:18:22  <Sylph> yeah
2010-10-01T03:18:28  <Sylph> that's the backend :D :D :D
2010-10-01T03:18:30  <Sylph> mostly
2010-10-01T03:18:38  <Sylph> I was worried that the backend is time consuming already
2010-10-01T03:18:42  <Sylph> but 10 ms isn't bad
2010-10-01T03:18:54  <Sylph> The way I coded it also makes the front end easy to code and work with :)
2010-10-01T03:18:57  <antimatroid2> yeah, but i might then run some of those algorithms a lot of times
2010-10-01T03:19:03  <Sylph> I will, likely
2010-10-01T03:19:13  <antimatroid2> the quicker the better
2010-10-01T03:19:17  <Sylph> was why I'd start to worry if it's 50ms :/
2010-10-01T03:19:27  <Sylph> That was including writing several dozen lines of text into the text file
2010-10-01T03:19:45  <Sylph> how many ms is your bot taking now ?
2010-10-01T03:19:53  <antimatroid2> i print LOTS when i print my planet wars object
2010-10-01T03:19:58  <Sylph> lol
2010-10-01T03:20:04  <Sylph> you're really printing a lot eh :p
2010-10-01T03:20:10  <antimatroid2> :P
2010-10-01T03:20:12  <Sylph> I only print out a few dozen lines atm per turn
2010-10-01T03:20:13  <antimatroid2> output to file anyway
2010-10-01T03:20:33  <antimatroid2> i do a couple for each planet, each line fairly long
2010-10-01T03:20:40  <Sylph> 50 lines atm
2010-10-01T03:20:49  <Sylph> mostly destination scores though
2010-10-01T03:20:57  <antimatroid2> i haven't got mine turned on, nor is my bot in a working state :P
2010-10-01T03:21:02  <antimatroid2> currently cleaning everything up
2010-10-01T03:21:06  <Sylph> was my first part for my best planet heuristic
2010-10-01T03:21:09  <Sylph> Ah
2010-10-01T03:21:18  <Sylph> I just finished writing the backend from like scratch
2010-10-01T03:21:33  <antimatroid2> mine is pretty well set up minus refinements
2010-10-01T03:21:35  <Sylph> Moved from java bot that was built on top of starter package to a C# bot with totally rewritten stuff
2010-10-01T03:21:38  <Sylph> Ah nice
2010-10-01T03:21:44  <Sylph> I'm done with the backend
2010-10-01T03:21:50  <Sylph> just need to add the bot commands :)

2010-10-01T03:22:24  <Sylph> It got much more complicated than i bargained for in some ways, but in other ways it became much easier
2010-10-01T03:22:25  <Sylph> ah
2010-10-01T03:22:36  <Sylph> yeah, i've only added the distance calculation
2010-10-01T03:22:36  <antimatroid2> i think i've sort of worked out the desirable moves one might like to make to planets
2010-10-01T03:22:38  <Sylph> still need the other methods
2010-10-01T03:22:44  <Sylph> to add
2010-10-01T03:22:51  <Sylph> distance score is done i mean
2010-10-01T03:22:52  <antimatroid2> you have future states yeah?
2010-10-01T03:23:00  <Sylph> I read the entire game state to the very end
2010-10-01T03:23:04  <antimatroid2> to account for incoming fleets?
2010-10-01T03:23:05  <Sylph> not really, but hey, that's the idea
2010-10-01T03:23:10  <Sylph> that was my old bot
2010-10-01T03:23:14  <Sylph> that i coded on first day i joined
2010-10-01T03:23:21  <Sylph> took into account incoming friendly/hostile fleets
2010-10-01T03:23:27  <Sylph> this one is kinda beyond that
2010-10-01T03:23:30  <Sylph> way beyond :p
2010-10-01T03:26:02  <Sylph> I just can't wait til It works so I can see that all my effort redoing the backend paying off :D
2010-10-01T03:26:59  <antimatroid2> i always get to the end, put it up on tcp, then start fucking with stuff when it loses a match
2010-10-01T03:27:04  <antimatroid2> then it all ends up a complete mess again aha
2010-10-01T03:27:19  <antimatroid2> it's a viscious cycle
2010-10-01T03:27:36  <Sylph> lol
2010-10-01T03:27:43  <Sylph> Atm it shouldn't turn into complete mess
2010-10-01T03:27:48  <Sylph> I put all the mess on the planetwars.cs >.>

2010-10-01T04:09:23  <Sylph> ah fun
2010-10-01T04:09:39  <Sylph> at least yours is guaranteed to work :D
2010-10-01T04:09:58  <HakanD> although not did much for now
2010-10-01T04:09:59  <HakanD> hehe

2010-10-01T04:16:35  <Sylph> I'm not sure if its really good tbh, but theoretically it minimize your finger travel time
2010-10-01T04:16:44  <Sylph> cause less strain in the long term, and let you type faster
2010-10-01T04:16:52  <Sylph> but... theories xd

2010-10-01T04:18:03  <Sylph> I got to 40-50 wpm on dvorak, and 30 on colemak i think, and yeah way too slow for my liking :/
2010-10-01T04:18:27  <HakanD> yep dvorak
2010-10-01T04:18:37  <Cyndre> ouch - I hit 110 - 120 on qwerty

2010-10-01T04:21:28  <Sylph> lol ?
2010-10-01T04:22:53  <Cyndre> we were talking earlier about a bot that would only react.  Once enemy dispatched ships you would either copy the move or dispatch ships to gank.   If your ships to take was less then enemy ships to take including growth you ganked the planet
2010-10-01T04:23:16  <HakanD> i have 3 functions left also

2010-10-01T05:13:27  <Sylph> not sure if ganking is a normal strategy, tbh, cyndre. Being slow hurts too.
2010-10-01T05:13:53  <Sylph> I've been considering it too, and still am though
2010-10-01T05:13:57  <Sylph> sick of enemy doing that to me
2010-10-01T05:13:57  <sigh> ganking?
2010-10-01T05:14:11  <Sylph> though the new bot i got is unlikely to get ganked.
2010-10-01T05:14:17  <Sylph> <Cyndre> we were talking earlier about a bot that would only react.  Once enemy dispatched ships you would either copy the move or dispatch ships to gank.   If your ships to take was less then enemy ships to take including growth you ganked the planet
2010-10-01T05:15:14  <Umsturz> sounds like valid tactic to me
2010-10-01T05:15:45  <sigh> Umsturz: they are talking about using that as an entire strategy, not just a tactic
2010-10-01T05:16:14  <sigh> so has anyone implemented this, or is it just all talk? :P
2010-10-01T05:16:16  <Umsturz> well then it sounds like a valid, if not smart strategy to me ; )
2010-10-01T05:17:40  <Umsturz> I think "ganking" will still loose against a good swarming bot
2010-10-01T05:17:58  <Umsturz> it kinda depends on the map
2010-10-01T05:18:30  <HakanD_> see Mcleopold's post about early game

2010-10-01T05:23:40  <Sylph> one growth difference is going to change the game.

2010-10-01T08:10:53  <antimatroid2> and then i put it back onto the new one for its first loss aha
2010-10-01T08:11:22  <antimatroid2> woah, that was a bug too :(
2010-10-01T08:11:54  <sigh> that's good, means easy fix
2010-10-01T08:12:12  <antimatroid2> i have no idea what's causing it :P
2010-10-01T08:12:27  <antimatroid2> just that it shouldn't have sent that much on the first move by expected design
2010-10-01T08:12:44  <sigh> at least you have a concrete failure case
2010-10-01T08:13:15  <antimatroid2> okay, this bot is way buggy :|
2010-10-01T08:13:21  <antimatroid2> i can't believe it won the first 12 or so games

2010-10-01T12:00:19  <McLeopold> But losing that first growth 5 is a mistake I'm trying to correct.
2010-10-01T12:00:59  <HakanD_> he wasted a lot of ships by keeping them at the back
2010-10-01T12:01:18  <HakanD_> and lost the advantage
2010-10-01T12:01:50  <McLeopold> He does a good job of overpower my planets.  He just doesn't back it up with more.

2010-10-01T16:19:55  <bartwe> and i'm back in the top10 on benzedrine
2010-10-01T16:20:40  <bartwe> apparently it is getting tighter
2010-10-01T16:25:06  <McLeopold> bartwe: that win against won't last long.  Fixing it is my next improvement. http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=261327
2010-10-01T16:27:21  <McLeopold> It's like lemmings over a cliff: http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=McLeopold.6.2
2010-10-01T16:27:22  <Migi32> McLeopold, fixing what? I believe you lost at move 1 already. So you mean not taking center with that amount of ships?
2010-10-01T16:27:32  <McLeopold> Yeah, that's what I'm fixing. :D
2010-10-01T16:27:43  <Migi32> o.O McLeopold
2010-10-01T16:27:52  <McLeopold> Most of my loses are similar.
2010-10-01T16:28:12  <Migi32> oh geez that is total pwnage
2010-10-01T16:28:56  <Migi32> I bet you'd be top 3 if you submitted your bot to main now (unless you still have those problems you talked about)
2010-10-01T16:28:57  <McLeopold> If you looking at the second game, I really like the long line of ships going to their death at the end.
2010-10-01T16:29:21  <McLeopold> No, I think that one problem is a big one.  I might bump to top 10.
2010-10-01T16:30:21  <Migi32> you vs whiteside-cobalt?
2010-10-01T16:31:02  <McLeopold> No, bartwe 12.3
2010-10-01T16:32:27  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=257477
2010-10-01T16:32:45  <McLeopold> That one is like the death star blowing up the home planet.
2010-10-01T16:34:10  <Zannick> that one is weird
2010-10-01T16:34:18  <Zannick> it changed tactics at turn 123-124
2010-10-01T16:34:43  <Migi32> yea
2010-10-01T16:35:10  <Migi32> but yes, it's kinda cool that you send a line of ships and his home planet goes 150... 149... 148...
2010-10-01T16:35:32  <McLeopold> the count down until failure...
2010-10-01T16:35:43  <Zannick> yes, and after 70 turns of that it's at 70 and then the strategy changes
2010-10-01T16:36:37  <Migi32> McLeopold, I don't get the 4 ships you sent there first turn
2010-10-01T16:36:50  <Migi32> no wait 2nd turn
2010-10-01T16:37:10  <Migi32> what were they for?
2010-10-01T16:37:12  <McLeopold> Yeah, sometimes it's hard to explain my bot.
2010-10-01T16:37:32  <McLeopold> Like, I don't really know why it changed strategies at turn 124.
2010-10-01T16:37:45  <McLeopold> It's still attacking the right planet.
2010-10-01T16:38:30  <Migi32> well, maybe it saw something there, but it's far more reasonable than sending 4 ships into a 5-growth planet
2010-10-01T16:39:27  <McLeopold> at turn 123, he had 77.  which means in 78 turns the planet is mine.
2010-10-01T16:39:48  <McLeopold> 123 + 78 = 211

2010-10-01T16:40:42  <McLeopold> turn 172, dmj stops supporting
2010-10-01T16:41:21  <Migi32> he probably saw the inevitable doom
2010-10-01T16:41:41  <Migi32> which means dmj looks 28 turns ahead
2010-10-01T16:41:47  <Migi32> interesting :P
2010-10-01T16:42:41  <McLeopold> I suppose sending directly from each planet is faster than routing through the center.
2010-10-01T16:42:51  <McLeopold> But the pulsing?  I have no idea.
2010-10-01T16:42:56  <McLeopold> And I wrote it. :D
2010-10-01T16:44:56  <Zannick> heh
2010-10-01T16:45:04  <McLeopold> Here's some good analysis.  At turn 30, dmj has 170 "extra" units on his side.
2010-10-01T16:45:25  <bartwe> lost in move 1 http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=261516
2010-10-01T16:45:27  <bartwe> stupid
2010-10-01T16:45:28  <McLeopold> If he went for the 85, he would have held.
2010-10-01T16:46:10  <Migi32> he could've broken you with 158 ships
2010-10-01T16:46:23  <Migi32> well, 159
2010-10-01T16:46:30  <McLeopold> Me? Never.
2010-10-01T16:46:33  <Migi32> 18 ships + 10 turns * 14 growth
2010-10-01T16:46:43  <Migi32> oh no wait its 19 growth
2010-10-01T16:46:53  <McLeopold> He has to cross the void as well as me.
2010-10-01T16:47:21  <Migi32> yea, I know, I just miscalculated
2010-10-01T16:47:54  <Migi32> he needed 198 ships
2010-10-01T16:48:08  <Migi32> just to break your front
2010-10-01T16:48:39  <McLeopold> bartwe: you didn't really lose until turn 44
2010-10-01T16:49:07  <McLeopold> bartwe: and turn 48
2010-10-01T16:50:35  <bartwe> at move 44 i'm 200 units behind (311 vs 531) i think at that point winning has become impossible
2010-10-01T16:50:46  <McLeopold> I think you could have held.
2010-10-01T16:50:58  <McLeopold> You abandoned a planet.
2010-10-01T16:51:32  <Zannick> spending all 100 ships on the distant 5-growth was suboptimal, though
2010-10-01T16:51:40  <Migi32> (McLeopold, I PM'd you)
2010-10-01T16:51:41  <McLeopold> Yes, it was.

2010-10-01T16:57:19  <Migi32> the difficulty of this game is really increasing, though

2010-10-01T16:59:21  <McLeopold> I've found some critical bugs in the old version.
2010-10-01T17:01:05  <Migi32> like, miscalculations or bad orders?

2010-10-01T18:09:12  <boiserm> would be interesting to get line counts for top ~50 bots
2010-10-01T18:09:26  <boiserm> compare within each programming language, etc.
2010-10-01T18:11:31  <Migi32> and what would you think is better, less or more?

2010-10-01T18:12:27  <Sylph> less code with much more bloated memory or cpu requirement is not good either
2010-10-01T18:12:32  <Zannick> or cat, for really small files
2010-10-01T18:14:23  <boiserm> My guess is that it would be surprisingly few lines for the top bots
2010-10-01T18:14:44  <Sylph> I doubt it :p
2010-10-01T18:14:52  <Sylph> you need to predict the future, etc
2010-10-01T18:14:59  <Sylph> few lines = you get no predictions, and flying blindly
2010-10-01T18:15:08  <Sylph> need some level of prediction, anyway
2010-10-01T18:15:21  <boiserm> agreed, prediction is good

2010-10-01T18:17:40  <Sylph> hush :p
2010-10-01T18:17:51  <boiserm> ;)
2010-10-01T18:18:06  <Sylph> I am just going to be like 'wtf' if my new bot does worse. :P
2010-10-01T18:18:13  <Sylph> which I doubt
2010-10-01T18:19:20  <jahnson> why isnt c# being fixed
2010-10-01T18:19:31  <Sylph> it won't til my b ot start working :D
2010-10-01T18:19:34  <Sylph> just kidding
2010-10-01T18:19:37  <Sylph> i have no idea
2010-10-01T18:19:59  <Sylph> they like to use outdated mono version to gimp us, or there are severely outdated apps in the server that depend on old mono
2010-10-01T18:20:09  <Sylph> or just lazy
2010-10-01T18:20:10  <Sylph> :|
2010-10-01T18:20:16  <jahnson> darn
2010-10-01T18:20:40  <Sylph> Mine atm is brute forcing a lot tbh, boiserm
2010-10-01T18:20:48  <jahnson> Java's close enough for speed+ease i guess
2010-10-01T18:20:58  <Sylph> yea, was why i switched to java, but back to C# now :/
2010-10-01T18:21:05  <Sylph> I prefer C#, even if its largely the same. :|
2010-10-01T18:21:10  <rod> what do you guys mean by bruteforcing

2010-10-01T18:21:17  <jahnson> yeah
2010-10-01T18:21:21  <Sylph> calculating every possible future move, rod.
2010-10-01T18:21:27  <rod> oh...
2010-10-01T18:21:39  <rod> thats a lot
2010-10-01T18:21:43  <Sylph> yup
2010-10-01T18:21:50  <Sylph> you can choose how far you get into that though
2010-10-01T18:21:53  <jahnson> how many can you do in 1 sec?
2010-10-01T18:21:55  <Sylph> and remove the crappy moves
2010-10-01T18:22:00  <Sylph> from calculations
2010-10-01T18:22:14  <Sylph> no idea, i only go as far as I feel I need
2010-10-01T18:22:20  <Sylph> it have a weakness that i might fix later if i have to
2010-10-01T18:22:39  <Sylph> there's one major thing that it don't predict, but it should theoretically not matter so much in the grand scheme
2010-10-01T18:22:44  <Sylph> not saying what though :D
2010-10-01T18:22:58  <jahnson> lol
2010-10-01T18:23:38  <Sylph> It would turn into a headache implementing that/fixing that.  >.>
2010-10-01T18:24:09  <Sylph> oh wait nm, maybe it calculates it :D
2010-10-01T18:24:11  <Sylph> Nevermind :D :D :D
2010-10-01T18:24:16  * Sylph happy now
2010-10-01T18:24:54  <jahnson> from headache to already implemented :-|

2010-10-01T18:25:33  <Sylph> lol
2010-10-01T18:26:17  <Sylph> future branching predictions gets to be a headache, and confuse me sometimes xD

2010-10-01T18:30:03  <Sylph> the old bot used push method and it was obviously weak xd

2010-10-01T19:18:46  <Sylph> for it
2010-10-01T19:18:46  <bhasker> i need to come up with a better way to manage state and calculate available ships
2010-10-01T19:18:49  <bhasker> per planet
2010-10-01T19:18:56  <Sylph> I got all that handled
2010-10-01T19:18:59  <bhasker> my current way is just not working out
2010-10-01T19:19:00  <Sylph> just need to do the attacking now
2010-10-01T19:19:03  <bhasker> too buggy by half

2010-10-01T19:19:05  <Sylph> good luck
2010-10-01T19:19:19  <Sylph> I need to work on the bot behaviours now

2010-10-01T19:19:30  <Sylph> bruteforced
2010-10-01T19:19:43  <bhasker> i am thinking of altering my bot strategy, to an optimization problem
2010-10-01T19:19:48  <Sylph> ah
2010-10-01T19:19:54  <bhasker> basically, given X ships
2010-10-01T19:20:00  <bhasker> over the next 20 turns
2010-10-01T19:20:14  <bhasker> what is the best set of moves based on how many ships i end up with at end of 20
2010-10-01T19:20:18  * Sylph nods
2010-10-01T19:20:20  <Sylph> that's nice
2010-10-01T19:20:25  <Sylph> i don't go that far
2010-10-01T19:20:32  <Sylph> hrm
2010-10-01T19:20:35  <Sylph> maybe i am
2010-10-01T19:20:36  <bhasker> but obviously its not correct since i don't account for enemy moves
2010-10-01T19:20:37  <bhasker> lol
2010-10-01T19:20:38  <Sylph> but I just predict every possible ones xd
2010-10-01T19:21:00  <Sylph> ow
2010-10-01T19:21:03  <bhasker> basically if a planet has a -ve roi i ignore it
2010-10-01T19:21:06  <sigh> bhasker: even without considering enemy moves you have to make a lot more simplifications
2010-10-01T19:21:11  <Sylph> why b other if you aren't counting their moves>.<
2010-10-01T19:21:11  <bhasker> yea

2010-10-01T19:21:43  <bhasker> well the problem has always been that if i go with heuristics for planet values based on their position and growth rate
2010-10-01T19:21:50  <sigh> also, why 20 moves?
2010-10-01T19:22:06  <bhasker> oh well my plan is to look forward maxDistance/2
2010-10-01T19:22:12  <Sylph> ah
2010-10-01T19:22:17  <Sylph> mine actually look forward maxdistance atm
2010-10-01T19:22:18  <Sylph> :|
2010-10-01T19:22:19  <bhasker> 20 i just picked as a number
2010-10-01T19:22:25  <sigh> why maxdistance/2? :P
2010-10-01T19:22:27  <Sylph> why /2 ?
2010-10-01T19:22:37  <bhasker> hold on
2010-10-01T19:22:41  <Sylph> optimization or something ? that would hurt you.
2010-10-01T19:22:47  <Sylph> your prediction
2010-10-01T19:23:15  <bhasker> well go to far into future and it will break down without counting enemy moves
2010-10-01T19:23:19  <bhasker> the further i predict
2010-10-01T19:23:23  <bhasker> the worse it will be
2010-10-01T19:23:25  <Sylph> naturally
2010-10-01T19:23:29  <Sylph> just add counting enemy moves to it :D
2010-10-01T19:23:41  <bhasker> can't solve it in one second
2010-10-01T19:23:45  <Sylph> mine does that anyway
2010-10-01T19:23:46  <bhasker> if you start adding enemy moves
2010-10-01T19:23:47  * Sylph nods
2010-10-01T19:23:47  <Sylph> okay
2010-10-01T19:23:58  <sigh> the further you look, the more you emphasis production rate
2010-10-01T19:23:58  <Sylph> mine does that, but diff bot diff algorithm xd
2010-10-01T19:24:00  <bhasker> so initially i can predict far because on most maps enemy is far
2010-10-01T19:24:13  <bhasker> as the game progresses reduce the prediction distance
2010-10-01T19:24:19  <bhasker> to a few turns
2010-10-01T19:24:36  <bhasker> or rather depending on enemy position change the prediction distance
2010-10-01T19:24:46  <Sylph> sounds complicated .:D
2010-10-01T19:24:58  <bhasker> basically i am hoping it will help me pick planets better
2010-10-01T19:25:01  <Sylph> mine just predict everything for max distance turns. ^^
2010-10-01T19:25:24  <sigh> I just predict until the arrival of the last fleet (for a given planet)
2010-10-01T19:25:27  <bhasker> the problem i have right now is, it goes by how valuable a planet will be given its location and growth rate
2010-10-01T19:25:34  * Sylph nods at sigh
2010-10-01T19:25:37  <sigh> because anything after is simple calculation
2010-10-01T19:25:55  <bhasker> as a result it picks wrong planets when there could be something easier to grab nearby
2010-10-01T19:26:16  <bhasker> one way to fix that will be to scan my list and boost planets that are nearby in priority
2010-10-01T19:26:20  <bhasker> so that i first try to grab them
2010-10-01T19:26:37  <sigh> that's sort of what I did
2010-10-01T19:26:48  <bhasker> the alternative is to do an optimization strategy
2010-10-01T19:26:56  <bhasker> where i try to maximize my ROI
2010-10-01T19:27:04  <Sylph> people target closest distance, its kinda basic
2010-10-01T19:27:06  <bhasker> so if i could capture planet X,Y or Z
2010-10-01T19:27:13  <bhasker> which of them will give me the best ROI
2010-10-01T19:27:16  <bhasker> over next X turns
2010-10-01T19:27:21  <bhasker> considering the fleets in flight
2010-10-01T19:27:35  <sigh> bhasker: I bet you will still have the same problem
2010-10-01T19:27:50  <bhasker> hmm shouldn't if there is a cheap planet to acquire its ROI will e high
2010-10-01T19:27:57  <bhasker> since cost to acquire will be low
2010-10-01T19:28:13  <bhasker> so i am hoping it will pick cheaper planets over just positional planets
2010-10-01T19:28:31  <sigh> you aren't doing an ROI-type cacluation as it is?
2010-10-01T19:28:34  <Sylph> @_@
2010-10-01T19:28:35  <contestbot> Sylph: I'm sorry Dave, I cannot _@.
2010-10-01T19:28:49  <Sylph> i'm confused, don't everyone calculate based on ROI and distance already?
2010-10-01T19:29:09  <Sylph> going with only one of those would really hurt
2010-10-01T19:29:14  <sigh> doing ROI caculations result in picking planets that are too far sometimes
2010-10-01T19:29:19  <sigh> need to be smarter\
2010-10-01T19:29:30  <bhasker> it won't pick far planets
2010-10-01T19:29:34  <bhasker> cause time to acquire them will be high
2010-10-01T19:29:38  <bhasker> so ROI will be low
2010-10-01T19:29:52  <sigh> ok, we'll see :)
2010-10-01T19:29:58  <Sylph> well, you're just renaming 'score' to ROI from what I see
2010-10-01T19:30:03  <Sylph> :|
2010-10-01T19:30:10  <bhasker> hmm my current bot doesn't do any ROI
2010-10-01T19:30:26  <bhasker> what it does is places a value on each planet which is pretty much calculated as the value of the planet to me
2010-10-01T19:30:31  <bhasker> and goes after the most valuable planet
2010-10-01T19:30:37  * Sylph nods
2010-10-01T19:30:49  <Sylph> koay
2010-10-01T19:30:52  <Sylph> good luck :)
2010-10-01T19:30:52  <bhasker> which is a heuristic based on growth and distance from my planets
2010-10-01T19:31:08  <Sylph> not based on ship on the planet and incoming ?
2010-10-01T19:31:34  <bhasker> nope i go through my list of planets in order of value
2010-10-01T19:31:41  <bhasker> and try to acquire ones of highest value if i can
2010-10-01T19:31:46  <Sylph> well, you can add those to the values
2010-10-01T19:31:47  <bhasker> if i can't , i skip to the next one
2010-10-01T19:32:03  <bhasker> the problem is when you combine 4 different factors
2010-10-01T19:32:07  <bhasker> into one heuristic
2010-10-01T19:32:20  <bhasker> you get values you can't really explain ,since all of them are not in the same scale
2010-10-01T19:32:29  <Sylph> that's where you cahnge the scale
2010-10-01T19:32:41  <sigh> hint: cut down the heuristics you consider by using dimensional analysis
2010-10-01T19:33:04  * Sylph reads dimensional analysis
2010-10-01T19:33:13  <Sylph> ah well yea
2010-10-01T19:33:32  <bhasker> hmm i will have to read that i think i learnt it back in school or something
2010-10-01T19:33:32  <bhasker> ^
2010-10-01T19:33:40  <sigh> in other words, make sure your units work out, and your score is in units that make sense
2010-10-01T19:34:01  <sigh> and don't add apples to oranges, e.g. adding growth rate to number of ships
2010-10-01T19:34:15  <bhasker> yup thats why i kept my basic heuristic simple
2010-10-01T19:34:27  <bhasker> which actually works out quite well
2010-10-01T19:34:33  <bhasker> my bot is in the top 100
2010-10-01T19:34:33  <sigh> :)
2010-10-01T19:34:40  <sigh> cool
2010-10-01T19:34:42  <bhasker> but...it does stupid things
2010-10-01T19:34:49  <sigh> haha, mine too

2010-10-01T19:35:06  <bhasker> but since i work down my list
2010-10-01T19:35:13  <bhasker> i would be out of ships by the time i get to it

2010-10-01T19:35:42  <Sylph> so much work on it, but can't test til its done
2010-10-01T19:36:14  <Sylph> theoretically once i works out the kink it should easily be top 10, and the rest are just heuristic works. >.>
2010-10-01T19:36:23  <Sylph> but taking time. :|
2010-10-01T19:36:26  <Sylph> code it for me, sigh :|

2010-10-01T19:36:49  <Sylph> yeah
2010-10-01T19:37:07  <Sylph> i'm on the ROI heuristic atm actually
2010-10-01T19:37:17  <Sylph> trying to figure what I want atm for this bot iteration
2010-10-01T19:37:33  <sigh> bhasker: a week or two ago your bot would have been in the top 20-30 I think
2010-10-01T19:37:47  <bhasker> it hit top 50 yesterday
2010-10-01T19:37:59  <sigh> cool
2010-10-01T19:37:59  <bhasker> i think it went upto 48 or something
2010-10-01T19:38:05  <bhasker> then dropped 30 ranks

2010-10-01T19:49:44  <bhasker> it isn't that good

2010-10-01T19:50:22  <bhasker> wow must be my lucky day make that 7 wins

2010-10-01T19:53:15  <Sylph> hrm you're right bhasker, I'm finding getting rid the 'distance score' stuff might be useful
2010-10-01T19:53:32  <Sylph> since the 'ROI' stuff that calculate the worth of the planet already take that into account :|
2010-10-01T19:53:41  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-01T19:53:48  <bhasker> also logs and squares are your friend

2010-10-01T20:00:36  <Sylph> no idea
2010-10-01T20:00:57  <McLeopold> bhasker: is that the official results?
2010-10-01T20:01:05  <Sylph> seems not
2010-10-01T20:01:16  <Sylph> since i just checked the ofifcial pagea :p

2010-10-01T20:03:49  <bhasker> all the best
2010-10-01T20:04:02  <bhasker> i am so tempted to rewrite the bot, but i am not sure my rewrite will do better
2010-10-01T20:04:02  <Sylph> thanks
2010-10-01T20:04:10  <Sylph> I rewrote my bot completely from my first bot

2010-10-01T20:04:15  <Sylph> but my first bot was a first day result

2010-10-01T20:21:21  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: but do you think ai 's code will never change or evolve?  Because the page makes that broad assumption
2010-10-01T20:21:57  <jmcarthur> certainly the AI could optimize itself further for optimizing paperclip production, sure
2010-10-01T20:22:10  <Cyndre> no, random bitflips that change behavior
2010-10-01T20:22:18  <jmcarthur> ah, then we aren't talking about software
2010-10-01T20:22:25  <Cyndre> why not?
2010-10-01T20:22:54  <jmcarthur> random bitflips sounds like a hardware thing, doesn't it?
2010-10-01T20:23:23  <jmcarthur> or perhaps wetware, if you are including human coding error
2010-10-01T20:23:34  <jmcarthur> but that would only be an upfront randomness
2010-10-01T20:23:37  <Cyndre> no, durring expansion/replication random bit can flip durring copying
2010-10-01T20:24:04  <jmcarthur> yeah that sounds like something that can only happen for physical reasons to me

2010-10-01T20:24:28  <jmcarthur> or at least i don't know of a way for software to randomly flip a bit
2010-10-01T20:24:39  <Cyndre> the software has to run on something

2010-10-01T20:25:55  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: but thats like saying I dont look at our bodys to be part of being human
2010-10-01T20:25:56  <bhasker> but what if the AI is coded to be random?
2010-10-01T20:25:58  <sigh> anyway, a good AI would make itself robust against errors
2010-10-01T20:26:01  <bhasker> like do random things
2010-10-01T20:26:07  <bhasker> and evolve
2010-10-01T20:26:21  <Cyndre> which is what I was suggesting
2010-10-01T20:26:34  <sigh> a random bit flip shouldn't affect a good AI
2010-10-01T20:26:38  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i fully admit that a random bitflip caused by a freak hardware malfunction could cause an AI to optimize its duration of existence rather than something else, but that's essentially the same reason as human error. it's an outside force creating it, not an internal willpower
2010-10-01T20:26:57  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: thats how evolution works
2010-10-01T20:27:38  <sigh> evolution has to act under specific conditions, not every system can evolve
2010-10-01T20:27:41  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i agree, but this still boils down to a physical argument about a (what i understood to be) metaphysical topic

2010-10-01T20:28:03  <McLeopold> best game yet though
2010-10-01T20:28:39  <Cyndre> sigh: its the compilation of millions of random errors that dont kill the bot

2010-10-01T20:29:04  <Cyndre> lest we forget where humans came from
2010-10-01T20:29:36  <sigh> Cyndre: you can't just introduce random errors, and call it evolution!
2010-10-01T20:29:40  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: btw, the reason i /ignored you earlier wasn't an attempt to be rude. it was just so we would stop arguing
2010-10-01T20:29:43  <sigh> that's not how it works

2010-10-01T20:30:43  <Sylph> lies
2010-10-01T20:30:57  <Sylph> had an annoying bug  on my codde i just fixed xd
2010-10-01T20:30:57  <Sylph> mm
2010-10-01T20:31:05  <Cyndre> anyways I gotta take kids to park, but look up evolution - random mutations that allow you to out compete those around you
2010-10-01T20:32:04  <McLeopold> I'm out competing other bots.  Are you calling me a mutant?
2010-10-01T20:32:28  <McLeopold> ug, second loss to ragebot
2010-10-01T20:35:05  <jmcarthur> merriam webster says nothing about randomness, mutations, or competition in its definitions for evolution
2010-10-01T20:35:46  <jmcarthur> well, it does mention "modifications in successive generations"
2010-10-01T20:36:01  <jmcarthur> so i guess that could be seen as a kind of mutation
2010-10-01T20:37:12  <McLeopold> I WIN! http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=264334
