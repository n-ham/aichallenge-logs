2012-04-28T01:37:05  <antimatroid> @later tell mcstar it was simple, rationals are countable so you can take the sequence of rational point sets and put the set of irrationals at the front, then the union is the real numbers and each set in the sequence has a finite number of rationals, as required
2012-04-28T01:37:05  <contestbot> antimatroid: As you wish.
