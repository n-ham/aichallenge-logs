2011-06-21T02:08:58  <stocha> how does trueskill do pairings really ?
2011-06-21T02:10:31  <Zaphus> what do you mean by pairings ?
2011-06-21T02:11:01  <stocha> Zaphus: how is the choosing of which bot to put in the same game fighting one another done
2011-06-21T02:11:37  <Zaphus> Trueskill doesnt do that, trueskill just generates ratings.   However if you want bots of similar strength in a battle, use ones of similar rating
2011-06-21T02:12:42  <Zaphus> of course that slows down your ability to 'climb' the ladder, mixing it up a bit gets better results (in my opinion)
2011-06-21T02:14:50  <Zaphus> plus you'd hate to play the same bots over and over again, which is what would tend to happen

2011-06-21T02:17:25  <Zaphus> stocha: is the reason you keep questioning Trueskill because it's giving rankings that dont match with the data (the game results) ?   if so that may indicate it's not implemented correctly.   now that the java bots are playing and everyone's getting lots of games, it seems to have settled pretty nicely from what I see

2011-06-21T02:21:09  <Zaphus> stocha: the one thing I'm not a fan of with this implementation is the increase in sigma (decreasing the probability that your rating is correct, effectively) that happens when you don't play games - but I kind of understand the logic behind it
2011-06-21T02:23:30  <stocha> Zaphus: whats the logic behind ?
2011-06-21T02:26:50  <Zaphus> stocha:  it's "we haven't seen you for a while, so maybe your rating isnt quite correct" - and by increasing sigma it gives you the chance to move more after the result of the game than you otherwise would.   helps take into account the new/changed bots may have affected your rating even if you havent played them yet
2011-06-21T02:27:01  <Zaphus> for humans it's more about the fact that we aren't consistent
2011-06-21T02:27:03  <stocha> Zaphus: I don't have enougth data to judge what bot are stronger. Though i'd still want to see those matrix for each bot. I'm too lazy to do it without a ready gui :o   However, i watched the ranking a lot, and it feels that it moves a lot. So if you trusted the values, depending on when you look at it, you would draw out different conclusions
2011-06-21T02:27:39  <Zaphus> I'd love the matrix - I have enough data in the SQL to get it now (no idea how to make a matrix from it, but I'll give someone the commands)
2011-06-21T02:27:55  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah, but bot are consistent. And new submission should not share anything with old submission. So really this feature is not desirable.
2011-06-21T02:28:57  <Zaphus> but your bot isn't consistant.   I can see that you sometimes beat davidju, and sometimes you lose - thats inconsistant
2011-06-21T02:29:11  <Zaphus> davidjliu I mean
2011-06-21T02:29:23  <stocha> Maybe the variations i observe are due partly to this feature (especially since sometime bots don't get a game in a day or so). But they i also think the pairing make for hard to draw conclusions in the first place.
2011-06-21T02:30:12  <Zaphus> look today, all bots are getting multiple games an hour - and ratings are settling
2011-06-21T02:30:17  <stocha> Zaphus:  the bot is consistent, in the sense that it does always play the same. There is a lot of randomness in games. But for a given set of opponent, you'll end up with a probility value that one is first for example.
2011-06-21T02:30:40  <stocha> Zaphus: but with humans, you woudln't have that feature. Because they tend to change over time. Try new things. Adapt, etc.
2011-06-21T02:31:10  <Zaphus> stocha: correct, if the odds are 60:40 that you will beat Zaphus, and then you beat me three times in a row, your rating will increase and it will think you are now (for example)  80:20  - and then I'll win a few and it will move back down.
2011-06-21T02:31:18  <stocha> The pairing is very important, because of the multplayer aspect.
2011-06-21T02:32:18  <stocha> Zaphus: the trouble is, i may have 60:40 on one on one, and then 30:30 if we add another well choosen bot. And then 70 if we add another well choosen bot

2011-06-21T02:32:57  <stocha> My retreating bots, seems especially good at disturbing my stronger bots, in multiplayer games.
2011-06-21T02:33:12  <Zaphus> rock paper scissors
2011-06-21T02:33:27  <stocha> so while i know how they do when i put only them in games, the ranking from the beta server, is all random.
2011-06-21T02:33:42  <Zaphus> here's the question, look at stoha2 - it's had more or less the same rating for the last 3 hours, and has played something like 30 games in that time
2011-06-21T02:34:05  <Zaphus> where's the randomness in there ?
2011-06-21T02:34:23  <stocha> Zaphus: at this particular moment, the rating do are consistent with my data.
2011-06-21T02:34:41  <Zaphus> matches mine too
2011-06-21T02:35:45  <Zaphus> mostly thats from the last two fixes that had nothing to do with ratings - it was to fix it up so everyone got a game, and to get Java to work :-)
2011-06-21T02:36:37  <Zaphus> but those changes had a big effect on the rating because now everyone gets to play - crashes messed up the ratings (sort of, it's actually accurate to say those bots were erratic)
2011-06-21T02:38:40  <Zaphus> stocha:  ignore whats happened with the rating up until today, see how it fares over the next couple of days.   I *think* it's a pretty good indicator of the strength of the bots at the moment from what I see
2011-06-21T02:38:55  <stocha> still the fact that sto_greed_002 is 8th leagues under davidjliu seems strange. Unless david changed his code of course
2011-06-21T02:39:31  <stocha> but being there is only one submission of both, i find it hard to believe. from what i have seen in the past. Maybe my conclusion where wrong though.
2011-06-21T02:40:12  <stocha> sir_macelon is the strongest, wich seems consistent with my own feeling.
2011-06-21T02:40:58  <Zaphus> stocha:  Davidjliu has played you 7 times today, and finished ahead of you in 5 of those - so I'd say he does deserve to be higher than you
2011-06-21T02:41:37  <stocha> well it's not me, it's only a ref_bot that is in fact public now. :p
2011-06-21T02:41:45  <Zaphus> but you get what I mean
2011-06-21T02:41:51  <stocha> Although i have some idea to test, i didn't put them yet.
2011-06-21T02:42:06  <Zaphus> 5:2 ratio means he should be ranked higher than that bot, all else being equal
2011-06-21T02:42:35  <stocha> there was far more than 7 games played involving those two bot.
2011-06-21T02:43:05  <stocha> if it only use 7 out of many, then yes the conclusion over the 7 are right, but what about all the data it has gathered ?
2011-06-21T02:43:06  <Zaphus> yeah, ignore before today
2011-06-21T02:43:18  <stocha> obviously with 7 game you can only have poor rating
2011-06-21T02:43:41  <Zaphus> well no, you've got 50+ games - only 7 involved him today though
2011-06-21T02:43:48  <stocha> Zaphus: why does it ignore before today
2011-06-21T02:44:02  <Zaphus> zaphus: no, I'm telling you to ignore before today :-)
2011-06-21T02:44:12  <Zaphus> stocha: I mean you, not me :-)
2011-06-21T02:44:42  <stocha> Zaphus: why should i do that ?
2011-06-21T02:45:15  <stocha> with 7 game, you can hardly draw out any conclusion. Unless you somewhat have microdata (like a human can look at a bot behavior and draw conclusion from that. eventually)
2011-06-21T02:45:25  <Zaphus> because the other things were tainting the ranking.    However, Trueskill (like Elo) is an on-the-fly rating system, it keeps adjusting after each game - you don't go back over the entire history each time a game is played
2011-06-21T02:45:53  <stocha> What's the use of that, with bot that play with consistency ?
2011-06-21T02:45:55  <Zaphus> stocha: you have way more than 7 games data, just 7 involving him.  but   you've played lots of people who've played him and Trueskill uses that too
2011-06-21T02:46:03  <stocha> A ranking that use all the data is far better in there.
2011-06-21T02:46:40  <Zaphus> this conversation will last forever :-)    offer something better, I can't keep arguing !
2011-06-21T02:46:47  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah, obviously those indirect data are less reliable.
2011-06-21T02:47:04  <stocha> i already offered something.
2011-06-21T02:47:10  <Zaphus> what was it ?
2011-06-21T02:47:47  <stocha> Calculate out of all data, a value from the probability of winning for each pair of bot.
2011-06-21T02:48:08  <stocha> i think that's what Bayeselo would. if not i'm sure there are algorithms to do just htat.
2011-06-21T02:48:38  <Zaphus> so you have a grid of results , but where's the ranking?
2011-06-21T02:48:53  <Rabidus> this n vs n thing complicates things
2011-06-21T02:48:53  <stocha> You'd have to ponder direct data much heavier than inderect data. Let's say 10 time more.
2011-06-21T02:49:07  <stocha> the grid is the objective  basis.
2011-06-21T02:49:14  <stocha> then you can use any system wich rely on it.
2011-06-21T02:49:22  <stocha> i think bayeselo rely on it.
2011-06-21T02:49:30  <stocha> beside previous ranking used bayeselo.
2011-06-21T02:49:35  <stocha> so the algorithms are already ready.
2011-06-21T02:50:11  <Zaphus> Guess I'm biased, I'm never going to agree that Bayeselo gives a better ranking
2011-06-21T02:50:13  <stocha> I have no idea how they came to the conclusion it was good for 1vs1 games, and bad for multiplayer free for all games.
2011-06-21T02:50:41  <Rabidus> what about ai-contest publishes the sql of scores and rankings
2011-06-21T02:50:49  <Rabidus> and everyone can try his own ranking mechanism
2011-06-21T02:50:57  <Rabidus> i would give a shot
2011-06-21T02:50:58  <stocha> i don't know bayeselo really. Except for the fact that some version of it was used for sorting out features of goplaying bot. And it worked quite well indeed
2011-06-21T02:51:00  <Zaphus> it's there on github
2011-06-21T02:51:10  <Rabidus> the .sql of the beta server?
2011-06-21T02:51:16  <Zaphus> oh no, the code
2011-06-21T02:51:21  <Rabidus> yeah, i ment the database
2011-06-21T02:51:25  <Rabidus> of scores only
2011-06-21T02:51:32  <stocha> if they gives the data, then people can't complain i guess :)
2011-06-21T02:51:40  <Zaphus> but everyone will just try to find the algorithm that gives the ranking order that they believe is correct :-)
2011-06-21T02:51:45  <stocha> If they are two lazy to work on it, too bad for them :
2011-06-21T02:52:11  <Rabidus> Zaphus: yeah? so? at least there is something to take a look
2011-06-21T02:52:14  <stocha> Zaphus: hopefully most method but the very twisted one would give about similar conclusions.
2011-06-21T02:52:42  <Zaphus> stocha:  why is it that you say you don't know Trueskill, and dont trust it, and you don't know Bayeselo and do trust it ?   whats magic about Bayeselo that convinces you where the science behind Trueskill doesnt ?
2011-06-21T02:52:53  <Zaphus> stocha:  I'm assuming it's not just anti-microsoft bias :-)
2011-06-21T02:53:10  <stocha> Zaphus:  i have seen it used for other thing. Building go playing bots. and it worked for that.
2011-06-21T02:53:48  <stocha> show me how trueskill was able to sort out go playing bot features efficiently, and built top world go bot, and i'll trust it more. Even if i don't know the internals well.
2011-06-21T02:54:08  <Zaphus> http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/67956/NIPS2006_0688.pdf   - note the word "Bayesian" in the title, does that make it better :-)
2011-06-21T02:54:30  <stocha> Beside, bayeselo, i have read article about. So although i have no precise view of the working, i have feelings about how it might work :p
2011-06-21T02:55:29  <stocha> "can infer rating out from team play"  I see the value of it for games like warcraft. However in ant, there are no teams.
2011-06-21T02:56:10  <Zaphus> team play can mean free for all too
2011-06-21T02:56:28  <stocha> Both bayselo and trueskill claim to be better than ELO. But elo is an old broken ranking system isn't it ?
2011-06-21T02:56:42  <stocha> team play means team play. For example 2vs2vs2
2011-06-21T02:56:48  <stocha> free for all, means no team play.
2011-06-21T02:57:09  <Zaphus> elo isn't broken, it's just limited
2011-06-21T02:57:21  <stocha> It doesn't mean it doesn't work without team play. only that it was built for a need we don't have here.
2011-06-21T02:57:22  <Zaphus> trueskill is used for lots of free-for-all games (no teams)
2011-06-21T02:58:16  <Zaphus> there are others as well - in the end one needs to get chosen, and the organisers chose this one.  I'm yet to see it giving the wrong results (based on the input) so I remain on the 'keep it' side
2011-06-21T03:00:02  <antimatroid> i thought bayeslo doesn't work for multiplayer games?
2011-06-21T03:00:04  <antimatroid> only 1v1?
2011-06-21T03:00:17  <antimatroid> stocha: did you comment about sharing your code?
2011-06-21T03:00:26  <antimatroid> personally i'd prefer to go back to having people not share source code again now
2011-06-21T03:00:30  <antimatroid> get my*
2011-06-21T03:00:57  <stocha> Yeah one thing that makes distrust true skill is the fact that over and over some people here said it's not working well for 1vs1
2011-06-21T03:01:15  <stocha> wich would mean it's not reliable really. but maybe it was not right to say that.
2011-06-21T03:01:16  <antimatroid> no, i never said that
2011-06-21T03:01:20  <Rabidus> 1v1v1v1 (a v b v c v d) is just a v b, a v c, a v d, b v c, b v d, c v d
2011-06-21T03:01:24  <antimatroid> i said the scoring system doesn't work for 1v1
2011-06-21T03:01:29  <antimatroid> i said nothing about trueskill
2011-06-21T03:01:32  <antimatroid> if you're referring to that
2011-06-21T03:01:41  <stocha> mm, maybe i confused myself out of that.
2011-06-21T03:01:48  <Zaphus> for a 1 v 1 game, Trueskill boils down to a Elo (slight maths differences, but no more than Chess and Go use variants)
2011-06-21T03:01:49  <stocha> or maybe someone else said it.
2011-06-21T03:02:17  <antimatroid> the scoring with spawn points might work for two player though
2011-06-21T03:02:20  <antimatroid> it didn't without it
2011-06-21T03:02:33  <stocha> Okay, so let's say true skill is accurate, and base on the assumption that each player do have a fixed consistent strength (the point i wanted to make sure through reading the article :p)
2011-06-21T03:02:38  <antimatroid> i think it would make more sense now
2011-06-21T03:02:49  <stocha> Then there is still the fact that we DO NEED a PAIRING POLICY
2011-06-21T03:03:00  <stocha> either there already is one. Or we need to build one.
2011-06-21T03:03:20  <Zaphus> stocha: because you don't want your bot playing random bots from the list, you only want to play the ones around you ?
2011-06-21T03:03:47  <Zaphus> stocha:  if so, that shouldnt be hard to do - but you won't get much variety in your games
2011-06-21T03:04:26  <Zaphus> becomes more like boxing, you have to fight all the way up the ladder to get the right to fight the top bots
2011-06-21T03:05:28  <antimatroid> there is already a matching algorithm
2011-06-21T03:05:39  <antimatroid> tron had random pairing and it was awful
2011-06-21T03:06:14  <Rabidus> what do you guys mean by pairing algorithm? like who will be against each other?
2011-06-21T03:06:19  <Zaphus>     -- pick the closest 100 available submissions (limited for speed)        we just dont have more than 100 yet :-)
2011-06-21T03:06:27  <antimatroid> Rabidus: yeah pretty much
2011-06-21T03:06:51  <Zaphus> yes, it will only choose from bots within 100 places of your bot.. we need a few hundred more test bots to see it in action :-)
2011-06-21T03:06:58  <antimatroid> in pw it did something like the following: pick the bot who has played the least number of games then match them against someone using a poisson distribution
2011-06-21T03:07:14  <Rabidus> i don't see a problem. Why just player x doesn't take a opponent who is rank +- ~20 ?
2011-06-21T03:07:16  <antimatroid> Zaphus: nah, it shouldn't restrict you to only bots near your ranking, but weight it
2011-06-21T03:07:53  <stocha> for 1vs1 given enougth data, pairing policy won't influence too badly on ranking. obviously. only slower to converge.
2011-06-21T03:08:06  <Rabidus> * +- ~20 of players rank
2011-06-21T03:08:08  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  do it on probability, the odds of playing someone decreases as the gap gets larger
2011-06-21T03:08:08  *** dr- <dr-!~lotus@tuborg.lifl.fr> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-21T03:08:08  <stocha> but with those multiplayer settings, i'm not confident about it converging somewhere.
2011-06-21T03:08:32  <Zaphus> Rabidus: it needs to be on position/rank - not rating (I think thats what you are saying)   - the rating value is arbitrary
2011-06-21T03:08:39  <stocha> from the article, it seems that trueskill does have a pairing algorithm, or am i wrong ?
2011-06-21T03:08:47  <Rabidus> yeah position.
2011-06-21T03:08:59  <stocha> then if need more diversity, try 50% chance that the game is a close game , and 50 % it's a wider game.
2011-06-21T03:09:11  <Zaphus> stocha:  for the xbox implementation, yes it does - but trueskill is just math itself and doesnt have one
2011-06-21T03:09:18  <stocha> i certainly can not find any close game at all in the current data.
2011-06-21T03:09:25  <Rabidus> lets say that we have list x where is included all bots. we go each one thru and get random opponent set who has rank near yours.
2011-06-21T03:09:26  <stocha> even 10% of close game would be good to me.
2011-06-21T03:09:35  <Rabidus> when list has gone thru, do it again
2011-06-21T03:09:57  <Rabidus> and before that 'do it again' we update the list
2011-06-21T03:10:08  <Rabidus> very hard to see a problem
2011-06-21T03:10:16  <stocha> Gives me at least 10% of games with all opponents closely matched, and i'll be quite happy :)
2011-06-21T03:10:30  <Zaphus> close game:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=29371&user=78
2011-06-21T03:11:12  <janzert> stocha: second to most recent game for first place player has 1st, 2nd, 5th and 19th ranked players?
2011-06-21T03:11:14  <stocha> 28 –	tmwitt
2011-06-21T03:11:30  <Zaphus> no pleasing some people :-)
2011-06-21T03:11:48  <stocha> find me a game, with less that 3 rank, and i'll give credit that there exist one close game.
2011-06-21T03:12:00  <stocha> but even it does exist one over 1000. It's not 10% for sure :)
2011-06-21T03:12:03  <Zaphus> what does that mean ? less than 3 rank ?
2011-06-21T03:12:19  <stocha> it means for example 1 vs 2 vs 5 vs 8
2011-06-21T03:12:34  <stocha> maximim three rank of jumping between players :p
2011-06-21T03:12:45  <Rabidus> 2 vs 5 isn't less than 3 rank ;)
2011-06-21T03:13:00  <Rabidus> (and 5 vs 8 isnt either)
2011-06-21T03:13:00  <stocha> isn't it less or equal ?
2011-06-21T03:13:07  <Rabidus> yes
2011-06-21T03:13:14  <stocha> okay then :p
2011-06-21T03:13:16  <stocha> 1 vs
2011-06-21T03:13:24  <stocha> 1 vs 8 isn't
2011-06-21T03:13:28  <stocha> but there exist a chain
2011-06-21T03:13:39  <Rabidus> yeah i understood that
2011-06-21T03:13:47  <stocha> so i say it's a close game. Maybe not the best definition
2011-06-21T03:13:51  <Rabidus> 1 vs 3 vs 5 vs 7
2011-06-21T03:13:52  <stocha> but let's get along with this one.
2011-06-21T03:14:23  <antimatroid> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=29676&user=126 i can has best expansion?
2011-06-21T03:14:26  <Zaphus> so yes, that would be awesome.  the player matching doesnt force that yet.  put a bug in asking for it to do them occasionally
2011-06-21T03:14:48  <stocha> let's call a close game, if there exist a chain of less than either 3 rank or 0.20 true skil points
2011-06-21T03:15:17  <Zaphus> technically thats a well-matched game, it may or may not turn out to be close
2011-06-21T03:15:29  <stocha> i would like that there was at least 10% of the game that match those criterions
2011-06-21T03:15:41  <Zaphus> so add a bug
2011-06-21T03:15:41  <stocha> yeah well-matched game then :)
2011-06-21T03:15:58  <stocha> i think if this is on, i'd be far more happy.
2011-06-21T03:16:19  <Zaphus> I doubt it, you'll just find something else to pick on :-)     but it's a good idea (and essential for the finals!)
2011-06-21T03:16:24  <stocha> (although you might want adjust the criterion at some point when we have more data)
2011-06-21T03:17:03  <Zaphus> actually, if we had 5000 entries, which is 50-60x what we have now, then you'd accept a wider range for closeness I imagine
2011-06-21T03:17:50  <Zaphus> maybe once per day, 1v2v3v4v5v6v7v8v9v10,  11v12v13v14v15v16v17v18v19v20  etc  :)
2011-06-21T03:18:09  <Rabidus> how much there was submissions in last competion ?
2011-06-21T03:18:11  <Rabidus> 1000 ?
2011-06-21T03:18:13  <Rabidus> 2000 ?
2011-06-21T03:18:15  <Zaphus> 4600 I think
2011-06-21T03:18:17  <Rabidus> :OO
2011-06-21T03:18:21  <Rabidus> wow
2011-06-21T03:18:22  *** mcstar <mcstar!~mcstar@adsl-89-132-11-97.monradsl.monornet.hu> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-21T03:18:25  <Zaphus> as in users
2011-06-21T03:18:39  <Rabidus> i think that 5000 entries is near then
2011-06-21T03:18:43  <Zaphus> lots of starter bots in there I suspect though
2011-06-21T03:18:49  <Rabidus> yeah ofcourse
2011-06-21T03:19:00  *** stocha_ <stocha_!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-21T03:19:02  <antimatroid> for reference, we had under 1000 bots for tron
2011-06-21T03:19:06  <Rabidus> i had very simple bot and lasted somewhere ... 500 ?
2011-06-21T03:19:08  <antimatroid> so who knows how many bots ants will have
2011-06-21T03:19:22  <Rabidus> ants looks very promising
2011-06-21T03:19:28  <Zaphus> so - somewhere between 1000 and (1000*4*4 = 16,000)  :-)
2011-06-21T03:19:33  <Rabidus>  :D
2011-06-21T03:19:37  <antimatroid> imo ants is a less interesting problem to planet wars, but it's way more suited to ai
2011-06-21T03:19:39  <Rabidus> nice guess
2011-06-21T03:19:46  <antimatroid> in that there are a lot more obvious problems to tackle
2011-06-21T03:19:52  <antimatroid> with many obvious approaches to them
2011-06-21T03:19:55  <Rabidus> i didn't think planet wars as a problem
2011-06-21T03:19:56  <mcstar> (i dreamt about extending lisp in ways i wouldnt think of not dreaming)
2011-06-21T03:20:21  <Zaphus> Gotta go - have a beach volleyball game to get to - cya later
2011-06-21T03:20:27  <antimatroid> see ya
2011-06-21T03:20:33  <mcstar> bb
2011-06-21T03:20:34  <Rabidus> but ants had multiple "simple" problems in first steps (pathfinding, fighting)
2011-06-21T03:20:38  *** stocha <stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-06-21T03:20:50  <antimatroid> yeah, food collection is the first thing for ants
2011-06-21T03:20:51  *** Zaphus <Zaphus!7cbf35b4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.124.191.53.180> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-06-21T03:20:56  <stocha_> i think if there exist wide gaps in trueskill give ranking possible chain, we should use the rank number, otherwise, we can just give a trueskill range for defining what closely related opponent are.
2011-06-21T03:21:26  <Rabidus> there might be a problem that there are too many submissions..
2011-06-21T03:21:56  <mcstar> too early to understand that sentence stocha
2011-06-21T03:21:58  <stocha_> for example if 1: 93.0    2 : 78.0     3 : 77.9   4 : 77. 8   5 : 60
2011-06-21T03:22:05  <stocha_> then 1 is close to 2
2011-06-21T03:22:11  <stocha_> but far from 3
2011-06-21T03:22:24  <stocha_> but 2 and 4 are close together. that sort of things
2011-06-21T03:22:50  <stocha_> 3 is far for 5, but close to 4
2011-06-21T03:22:59  <stocha_> and 4 is close to 5
2011-06-21T03:23:17  <stocha_> so we say a game is "well matched", if there exist a chain of closeness
2011-06-21T03:23:44  <mcstar> i would say we should look at stability
2011-06-21T03:23:49  <stocha_> then we can have ever stronger "well matched" condition from time to time. Like   two fartherst bot in, are close.
2011-06-21T03:23:51  <mcstar> how long a given order lasts
2011-06-21T03:23:51  <antimatroid> not all games need to be between bots of close rank
2011-06-21T03:23:58  <antimatroid> just on average pure random sucks ass
2011-06-21T03:24:07  <stocha_> i want 10 % of game closed ranked.
2011-06-21T03:24:16  <janzert> stocha_: you know trueskill has a built in metric for how 'good' a specific pairing is?
2011-06-21T03:24:26  <Rabidus> would it be stupid that in 8 players game  if you win a game, you'll get 5 points, second gets 3, third gets 2 and fourth gets 1, all others 0
2011-06-21T03:24:27  <stocha_> (for my own satifaction. more might be okay too)
2011-06-21T03:24:36  <janzert> you should go figure that out for the pairings and see how it is
2011-06-21T03:24:41  * antimatroid doesn't like 8+player games
2011-06-21T03:24:43  <antimatroid> too many bots
2011-06-21T03:24:51  * Rabidus doesn't like either
2011-06-21T03:24:53  <stocha_> janzert: let's use that then ? i hope it's not activated now ? from what i see about current pairing
2011-06-21T03:24:54  <Rabidus> yes
2011-06-21T03:25:02  <Rabidus> i think 8 is too big already
2011-06-21T03:25:05  * mcstar likes chocolate though
2011-06-21T03:25:08  <Rabidus> :p
2011-06-21T03:25:15  <janzert> stocha_: it doesn't tell you how to pair, it tells you how good a specific pairing is
2011-06-21T03:25:17  <antimatroid> janzert: what are your thoughts on number of bots?
2011-06-21T03:25:33  * janzert is fairly ambivalent about it
2011-06-21T03:25:52  <stocha_> janzert: okay so let's do it so, that 10% of the game are good pairings. And see how it feels then :p
2011-06-21T03:26:20  <janzert> go start checking them and report back what trueskill says about them
2011-06-21T03:26:32  <stocha_> because it's multiplayer game, let's have equivalent number of game for 2 opponents up to 8.
2011-06-21T03:26:36  <stocha_> and see how it feels.
2011-06-21T03:26:42  <stocha_> we do need 1vs1 game added though.
2011-06-21T03:27:09  <janzert> you're probably stuck there, cause antimatroid actively doesn't want them
2011-06-21T03:27:19  <stocha_> janzert: i don't know how to do that. I can say that about none match the criteria i gave though.
2011-06-21T03:27:26  <mcstar> what i dont get is: isnt this matching system self-balancing? why do you care at all?
2011-06-21T03:28:03  <stocha_> janzert: let's build an early poll and see how much antimatroid opinion match with most poeples feeling. What about the famous "decision making" team ?
2011-06-21T03:28:04  <janzert> anyway I'm off
2011-06-21T03:28:36  <janzert> that would be me, amstan and mcleopold and you haven't done much to sway me ;)
2011-06-21T03:29:26  <antimatroid> i'm not as opposed to 2 player anymore with spawn points i don't think
2011-06-21T03:29:35  <antimatroid> but i also haven't really thought too much about it since that happened
2011-06-21T03:29:41  <mcstar> anyway, stocha, wouldnt you be glad if the contest started already?
2011-06-21T03:29:55  <stocha_> let's at least try it during beta then.
2011-06-21T03:30:02  <stocha_> mcstar: no.
2011-06-21T03:30:10  <stocha_> it's ways too soon for starting it.
2011-06-21T03:30:16  <stocha_> although we could make publicity for the beta.
2011-06-21T03:30:22  <Rabidus> idd
2011-06-21T03:30:27  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@173-164-174-193-SFBA.hfc.comcastbusiness.net> has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
2011-06-21T03:30:29  <Rabidus> then tcp servers would get running too
2011-06-21T03:30:35  <stocha_> the beta is very important, because you can change the rules, and tweak things, and try stuff.
2011-06-21T03:30:58  <stocha_> tcp servers are important. Well one well built one is important.
2011-06-21T03:31:10  <stocha_> although i can't take profit out of them right now :p
2011-06-21T03:31:16  <mcstar> mcleopold said, i beleive, that if they start early the contest, they could make changes nevertheless
2011-06-21T03:31:19  <stocha_> because i have no hardware to run my bots.
2011-06-21T03:31:42  <Rabidus> i can spare my network and my server for tcp server
2011-06-21T03:31:44  <stocha_> making change during the contest, i strongly dissupport :p
2011-06-21T03:31:49  <Rabidus> but tcp server software is buggy atm.
2011-06-21T03:32:01  <antimatroid> mcstar: changes now are unideal
2011-06-21T03:32:07  <antimatroid> changes after launch are even more unideal
2011-06-21T03:32:13  <antimatroid> but if necessary yes they will be made
2011-06-21T03:32:17  <stocha_> all should be carved in stone, then people make their bot, they are ranked, and one winner is ellected somehow.
2011-06-21T03:32:48  <mcstar> well, its not too likely, but something can still come up after the rules are fixed....
2011-06-21T03:33:07  <antimatroid> we semi agreed to fix most of the rules this morning
2011-06-21T03:33:18  <stocha_> Rabidus:  i would appreciate that there exists an official way of setting up a tcp server that approximate "real" conditions though.
2011-06-21T03:33:24  <mcstar> what if there is a simple startegy to the game, and you couldnt do better if you were god himslef?
2011-06-21T03:33:39  <mcstar> what if a 1000 bots would implement that startegy?
2011-06-21T03:33:43  <antimatroid> mcstar: if that happened really early in the contest then that would be an example of the game breaking
2011-06-21T03:33:44  <Rabidus> there is tcp server on github that is ready to run
2011-06-21T03:33:47  <stocha_> mcstar: that's what the beta is for. finding stuff. If they are found after beta, they live with them.
2011-06-21T03:33:50  <antimatroid> if that happens well into the contest, good for them
2011-06-21T03:34:11  <stocha_> mcstar: then the challenge is a draw. and we wait for next one.
2011-06-21T03:34:18  <antimatroid> although where one would draw the line is anyones guess as it's never happened and i don't expect it to
2011-06-21T03:35:28  <stocha_> up from now there was always a clear winner. I have no reason yet to think that ant will be different. it might. it always might.
2011-06-21T03:35:53  <mcstar> yeah, prev. experience doesnt really help there
2011-06-21T03:36:14  <antimatroid> you can never be entirely certain about some of these things without actually running it and seeing what happens
2011-06-21T03:36:19  <mcstar> lets hope for the best :D
2011-06-21T03:36:20  <stocha_> at worse, there will be like 5 very strong bot, very closely matched. And then we have a problem.
2011-06-21T03:36:27  <stocha_> but i doubt it could be worse than that
2011-06-21T03:36:34  <antimatroid> one problem we saw with planet wars maps in the final contest was that a lot sucked
2011-06-21T03:36:41  <stocha_> even with blocking etc.
2011-06-21T03:36:44  <antimatroid> despite our efforts to eliminate "trivially crap maps" from being generated
2011-06-21T03:36:53  <stocha_> someone will still hack a way to get ahead.
2011-06-21T03:37:06  <antimatroid> but once those are generated there's no turning back
2011-06-21T03:37:10  <mcstar> antimatroid: was a new map generated for every new game?
2011-06-21T03:37:15  <stocha_> i don't think crap map should be eliminated either. But that's another story.
2011-06-21T03:37:15  <antimatroid> no
2011-06-21T03:37:28  <antimatroid> i am in favour of that though, there are reasonable arguments for or against the idea
2011-06-21T03:37:56  <antimatroid> stocha_: provided people know those types of maps wont show up, i don't mind
2011-06-21T03:38:04  <antimatroid> i do mind if we go through and select which maps not to use
2011-06-21T03:38:08  <stocha_> but as far as beta goes, i'm happy with the look of the map. Although i'd prefer random generated ones.
2011-06-21T03:38:27  <antimatroid> they are random
2011-06-21T03:38:37  <stocha_> and i'd like for beta at least to try the assymetric one.
2011-06-21T03:38:38  <antimatroid> once i finish exams i am going to play with maps
2011-06-21T03:38:43  <antimatroid> (I have my last exam thursday)
2011-06-21T03:38:55  <antimatroid> i thought they tried asymmetric and decided they sucked?
2011-06-21T03:38:57  <stocha_> they are not random in the sense that the same map can happen in more than one game.
2011-06-21T03:39:28  <stocha_> i tryed assymetric. And decided they where okay to find out wich bot is strongest.
2011-06-21T03:39:30  <mcstar> stocha_: try running your own bot on assym. maps see whats ur conclusion
2011-06-21T03:40:04  <stocha_> mcstar:  i already done that. I was always able to tell what bot was strongest. Even very closely related one.
2011-06-21T03:40:21  <mcstar> different versions of your own bot?
2011-06-21T03:40:29  <stocha_> different bots yes.
2011-06-21T03:40:31  <stocha_> or same bots.
2011-06-21T03:40:36  <stocha_> always consistent
2011-06-21T03:41:07  <stocha_> i don't know if it would converge much slower though. But it will converge.
2011-06-21T03:41:10  <antimatroid> i thought of an awesome extension to my food collection idea last night
2011-06-21T03:41:12  <mcstar> yeah, well, if a bot expands very fast( i mean theres no error in that part) than it can compensate for an asymmetry i guess
2011-06-21T03:41:45  <stocha_> mcstar: i was able to distinguish bot very close in strength
2011-06-21T03:42:00  <stocha_> BUT .. bot strength can depend on map distribution. And food spawning.
2011-06-21T03:42:20  <stocha_> so the strength is for a given distribution of maps building process, and food distribution .
2011-06-21T03:42:42  <mcstar> yeah, well than wtf are we talking about?
2011-06-21T03:42:53  <stocha_> it's not the same :)
2011-06-21T03:43:18  <stocha_> because you can have both symetric an assymetric maps, using closely related map shape and food distribution
2011-06-21T03:43:21  <mcstar> im sorry i must have misunderstood you, i thought that regardless of asymmetries, you could distunguish your bots as far as "strength" is concerned
2011-06-21T03:43:34  <stocha_> yeah, that's whay i claim.
2011-06-21T03:43:46  <stocha_> however the shape , and speed of food spawning affect bots.
2011-06-21T03:43:52  <mcstar> but now you say that: strength is for a given distribution of maps building process, and food distribution
2011-06-21T03:44:14  <stocha_> yeah, but it doesn't depend on it being symetric/vs assymetric
2011-06-21T03:44:18  <stocha_> in depends on shape
2011-06-21T03:44:22  <mcstar> obviously for an asymmetric map, food spawing cant be symmetric
2011-06-21T03:44:41  <mcstar> only statistical homogenity can be achieved
2011-06-21T03:45:02  <stocha_> for food spawning, it was more about the speed of it.
2011-06-21T03:45:18  <stocha_> does one food spawn every turn ? does they spawn more than every turn ? etc.
2011-06-21T03:45:30  <stocha_> then i didn't try twisted spawning strategyes
2011-06-21T03:45:38  <stocha_> like : spawn only at starting positions
2011-06-21T03:45:55  <stocha_> but even food speed can make or break bots.
2011-06-21T03:46:13  <stocha_> bots very well suited for high density food, might do poorly with low density
2011-06-21T03:46:22  <stocha_> high spawning rate rather
2011-06-21T03:46:29  <stocha_> then you have the time management also
2011-06-21T03:46:44  <stocha_> high food rate, often mean high ant count.
2011-06-21T03:47:03  <Rabidus> its players problem
2011-06-21T03:47:06  <stocha_> then the map shape : open maps are very different from tiny corridors labyrinth maps
2011-06-21T03:47:23  <mcstar> stocha_: how robust is path finding?
2011-06-21T03:47:25  <Rabidus> that's also player problem
2011-06-21T03:47:52  <stocha_> although in both case assymetric/vs symetric would give same bot strength, the probability of a map being wholy oppen between labyrinth corridor will change the respective strength of the bots.
2011-06-21T03:48:01  <mcstar> i.e. are there corner cases when it breaks down?

2011-06-21T03:48:33  <mcstar> sorry, i mean Your path finding
2011-06-21T03:48:39  <stocha_> mcstar: path finding is perfect path finding. You probably want to know what one i use ? i use perfect path finding one, with no congestion control.
2011-06-21T03:49:01  <stocha_> although i had some bot not using any pathfinding also.
2011-06-21T03:49:19  <mcstar> ok, just because i dont want to implement bfs and a* or any graph walking bitch
2011-06-21T03:49:39  <stocha_> especially in very oponned map, pathfinding might not add to much to bot strength; (nothing indeed in fact)
2011-06-21T03:49:44  <mcstar> right now im thinking about conves hulls
2011-06-21T03:49:46  <mcstar> convex
2011-06-21T03:50:26  <stocha_> i went with floodfill. it works well. it's perfect in the sense it will alway find the best path.
2011-06-21T03:50:38  <stocha_> it's easy to debug etc.
2011-06-21T03:50:48  <stocha_> i didn't have any performances problem so far.
2011-06-21T03:51:16  <stocha_> what's convex hulls ?
2011-06-21T03:51:34  *** aerique <aerique!310225@xs8.xs4all.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-21T03:52:35  <mcstar> well, given a set of points in any dimensin ther exists a uniqe polyhedron which contains all those points, and has the property of least volume and surface
2011-06-21T03:53:07  <mcstar> a line segment or a triangle is always a convex hull :D

2011-06-21T03:54:04  <mcstar> so, if the ant and the target are both part of the convex hull, i can calculate it with the points of water included, and i can simply travel one side of the convex hull
2011-06-21T03:54:07  <stocha> probably good for very big maps.
2011-06-21T03:54:17  <stocha> but there will not be any very big maps
2011-06-21T03:54:20  <mcstar> and it will take me to the target in optimal turns
2011-06-21T03:55:06  <stocha> with traffic control ?

2011-06-21T03:59:49  <antimatroid> my a* will crawl if there was LOTS of food i think

2011-06-21T04:02:18  <mcstar> no, sadly its proprietary
2011-06-21T04:02:30  <mcstar> you would like to see it?

2011-06-21T04:03:01  <aerique> mcstar: i hacked together one as well and it seemed like a waste of time to work on two seperate projects
2011-06-21T04:03:11  <mcstar> sure
2011-06-21T04:03:35  <mcstar> its more or less ready, i mean now its working perfectly, only not everything is implemented
2011-06-21T04:04:11  <mcstar> for example viewradius is not taken into account
2011-06-21T04:04:27  <mcstar> but for testing its alright
2011-06-21T04:04:41  <aerique> mcstar: same here, except my code is horrid (https://github.com/aerique/google-ai-challenge-2011-1-ants/tree/master/src-play-game)

2011-06-21T04:06:00  <mcstar> exactly what is written: its not for testing other bots other than cl classes
2011-06-21T04:06:12  <aerique> mcstar: ah, right.
2011-06-21T04:06:19  <mcstar> is it ok?
2011-06-21T04:06:30  <mcstar> i mean, i didnt want to replicate the official engine

2011-06-21T04:06:54  <aerique> right, clear.  i only replicated most of the original one for testing my engine

2011-06-21T04:55:15  <Rabidus> nice
2011-06-21T04:55:24  <antimatroid> george1914: i had an interesting idea for food collection last night...
2011-06-21T04:55:30  <george1914> aha?
2011-06-21T04:55:43  <george1914> go downstairs to fridge?
2011-06-21T04:55:52  <Rabidus> :D
2011-06-21T04:56:12  <antimatroid> do a bfs from all enemies locations to find the shortest number of turns it would take an enemy to reach a square, then in your search, only consider squares that aren't in the battle radius of a square an enemy can reach in time, so your search tracks around where an enemy can reach you
2011-06-21T04:56:43  <antimatroid> of course then you don't collect food you can't reach with such a condition
2011-06-21T04:56:46  <antimatroid> which i haven't resolved
2011-06-21T04:57:37  <george1914> there was similar thing in PW - picking planets i can reach always first, - made decision making easier cos you could kind of ignore enemy's actions
2011-06-21T04:57:47  <george1914> but it was too defensive/negative
2011-06-21T04:57:49  <antimatroid> not quite the same thing
2011-06-21T04:57:56  <antimatroid> it's easy to go to food you can reach first only
2011-06-21T04:58:07  <antimatroid> this is tracking the path around an enemies reach to avoid them
2011-06-21T04:58:11  <george1914> sure, but i wonder if you ignore a lot of (in practice) good moves
2011-06-21T04:58:16  <Rabidus> tcp, tcp, tcp
2011-06-21T04:58:22  <george1914> sorry Rabidus
2011-06-21T04:58:25  <Rabidus> :)
2011-06-21T04:58:31  <george1914> i am not very good with computers ...
2011-06-21T04:58:36  <antimatroid> at the moment i am just collecting every piece of food i can see
2011-06-21T04:58:38  <mcstar> antimatroid: dont you want to kill the ant that just ate your food?
2011-06-21T04:58:42  <antimatroid> which is useful while other bots suck :P
2011-06-21T04:59:05  <antimatroid> mcstar: let me come up with an example situation
2011-06-21T04:59:10  <mcstar> if you can rac the food in your battle radius, you can still make him unhappy
2011-06-21T04:59:15  <mcstar> reach
2011-06-21T04:59:34  <mcstar> of course thats probably only 1 square difference
2011-06-21T05:00:20  <antimatroid> mcstar: http://pastebin.com/mYnTXnfc
2011-06-21T05:00:23  <antimatroid> i think that works
2011-06-21T05:00:30  <antimatroid> if 'a' goes up then right, they get the food
2011-06-21T05:00:41  <antimatroid> if the go right then up, b will probably battle you before you get to the food
2011-06-21T05:01:07  <antimatroid> i think b might need to be 1 lower
2011-06-21T05:01:13  <antimatroid> but you get the idea yeah?
2011-06-21T05:01:17  <george1914> Rabidus: are there any 'tcp instructions for dummys like george'?
2011-06-21T05:01:35  <antimatroid> +1 for dummies tcp instructions
2011-06-21T05:02:10  <mcstar> going up before going right is not better than the other way around i think
2011-06-21T05:02:43  <Rabidus> use python
2011-06-21T05:02:45  <mcstar> the target of a is the south face of the food square
2011-06-21T05:02:47  <Rabidus> python tcpclient.py
2011-06-21T05:02:52  <Rabidus> it gives you some instructions
2011-06-21T05:02:55  <antimatroid> mcstar: http://pastebin.com/eQnygE2L try that situation
2011-06-21T05:03:30  <mcstar> a is 4 turns away from spawning a food
2011-06-21T05:03:33  <mcstar> i mean ant
2011-06-21T05:03:42  <antimatroid> if a goes E E and b goes N N then they fight
2011-06-21T05:03:52  <antimatroid> if a takes any other path to food then he gets there safely
2011-06-21T05:04:01  <antimatroid> any other min path*
2011-06-21T05:04:13  <mcstar> b is 5, so he can kill a before the ant is spawned
2011-06-21T05:04:29  <antimatroid> erm yes
2011-06-21T05:04:41  <antimatroid> do you get what i mean though?
2011-06-21T05:04:45  <mcstar> yes
2011-06-21T05:04:46  <antimatroid> my example isn't perfect
2011-06-21T05:05:15  <antimatroid> you could also just use the enemy ant information to track the path that stays furthest away from the enemy i think
2011-06-21T05:05:24  <antimatroid> which might be ideal, and it's fairly cheap
2011-06-21T05:07:29  <mcstar> i think later, when your battle strategy is ready, you can simply start a battle with that enemy ant
2011-06-21T05:07:36  <mcstar> and not to pay attention to the food
2011-06-21T05:07:39  <mcstar> you will get it
2011-06-21T05:07:57  <mcstar> so, for example you switch on battle mode, and send 2 ants there
2011-06-21T05:13:34  <antimatroid> ants would make for an excellent ai course assignment thing
2011-06-21T05:14:02  <antimatroid> first assignment is doing food collection, then second assignment is a tournament among the class, with a baseline bot written by the instructers that needs to be beaten in order to pass
2011-06-21T05:18:01  <george1914> Rabidus:  sorry to be dumb - i should do?  i guess something like:     ./tcpclient.py uhiainen.dyndns.org:992 995 george MyBot    ?
2011-06-21T05:27:19  <Rabidus> hehe, i don't remember.. i'm at work right now
2011-06-21T05:27:22  <Rabidus> but let me see
2011-06-21T05:28:13  <george1914> def main():      usage="""          tcpclient.py   host_or_ip  port  botpath  player_nick  [num_rounds]
2011-06-21T05:28:23  <Rabidus> python tcpclient.py uhiainen.dyndns.org 992 my_epic_bot.exe Rabidus
2011-06-21T05:28:27  <Rabidus> that works for me
2011-06-21T05:29:02  <mcstar> whoa, you have an epic bot too?
2011-06-21T05:29:22  <Rabidus> lol, no :D
2011-06-21T05:29:28  <Rabidus> that was just something what came my mind
2011-06-21T05:29:29  <antimatroid> mine is currently called graphbot :P
2011-06-21T05:29:40  <mcstar> i dont have one either :D
2011-06-21T05:30:24  <mcstar> mine has a stupid name, i thought about world peace when i named it
2011-06-21T05:30:28  <Rabidus> mine is 'aimyle' which means something .. ai hazzard or something :p
2011-06-21T05:32:08  <Rabidus> still 0/4 :<

2011-06-21T05:55:43  <george1914> Rabidus:  so, i am failing at the point:   # Start up the bot.  This may fail.
2011-06-21T05:55:53  <george1914> i.e.   bot = BotThread(bot_command)
2011-06-21T05:56:03  <Rabidus> how do you launch it ?

2011-06-21T06:08:25  <Zaphus> match going now
2011-06-21T06:09:37  <Rabidus> wow, nice
2011-06-21T06:09:59  <Zaphus> interesting, it says one of my moves is blocked...
2011-06-21T06:10:00  <george1914> hm,  i used  https://github.com/McLeopold/TCPServer
2011-06-21T06:10:09  <Zaphus> I used the berak one
2011-06-21T06:10:13  <george1914> ah
2011-06-21T06:10:27  <george1914> are there many differences?
2011-06-21T06:10:31  <Rabidus> whaat
2011-06-21T06:10:34  <Rabidus> lol :)
2011-06-21T06:10:44  <Zaphus> well, one works... thats a difference :-)
2011-06-21T06:10:48  <Rabidus> mcleopold's tcp server is for planet wars
2011-06-21T06:10:52  <george1914> i just sat down, saw the 2 links, and went for the first one ...
2011-06-21T06:11:01  <Zaphus> is there a ladder/website somewhere ?
2011-06-21T06:11:05  <george1914> sorry for the confusion
2011-06-21T06:11:10  <Rabidus> its ok :)
2011-06-21T06:11:17  <george1914> http://uhiainen.dyndns.org:991/
2011-06-21T06:11:29  <Zaphus> I can't connect to that
2011-06-21T06:11:57  <Rabidus> well, it works for me anf for george
2011-06-21T06:12:01  <Rabidus> *and
2011-06-21T06:12:19  <Zaphus> hmm - could be the port or something, since I'm obviously connecting to 992 for the match
2011-06-21T06:12:46  <Rabidus> 992 is for the matches where bots play
2011-06-21T06:12:51  <Rabidus> and 991 is for website
2011-06-21T06:13:08  <george1914> actually ...:991 isnt reloading for me atm
2011-06-21T06:13:15  <george1914> was earlier
2011-06-21T06:13:25  <Rabidus> wow, same to me
2011-06-21T06:13:30  <Zaphus> :-)
2011-06-21T06:13:36  <Zaphus> I didnt do it !
2011-06-21T06:14:03  <Rabidus> ok, so that other 992 bot-thread is blocking connections or something......... dunno
2011-06-21T06:14:20  <Rabidus> 991 worked when there was no games running
2011-06-21T06:14:51  <Zaphus> perhaps.. will let you know when it stops - could be a while :-)
2011-06-21T06:15:13  <Rabidus> yesterday (or was it day before that) it took something like 45 minutes per match :p
2011-06-21T06:15:40  <Zaphus> whats the time limit set to ?
2011-06-21T06:15:46  <Rabidus> 5 seconds
2011-06-21T06:16:11  <Zaphus> a 2000 turn match could take 166 minutes then :-)
2011-06-21T06:16:17  <Rabidus> my upstream is only 2 Mb so that's fair enough i think
2011-06-21T06:16:23  <Rabidus> yeah .. :)
2011-06-21T06:16:33  <Zaphus> thats assuming all moves are in parallel, otherwise multiply by the number of bots !
2011-06-21T06:17:09  <Rabidus> and python is taking again 100% cpu
2011-06-21T06:17:21  <Rabidus> no its not parallel :)
2011-06-21T06:17:25  <Rabidus> afaik
2011-06-21T06:17:39  <Zaphus> wish I had dumped the output of this to a file, I want to know why it's rejecting my move
2011-06-21T06:17:46  <antimatroid> Rabidus: just connected :)
2011-06-21T06:18:10  <Zaphus> finished
2011-06-21T06:19:24  <Rabidus> georges bot is making 'invalid player socket' :s, but that's because he were using wrong client
2011-06-21T06:19:28  <Rabidus> so that will take a time
2011-06-21T06:20:06  <antimatroid> i grabbed the file from your github page
2011-06-21T06:20:17  <antimatroid> i wasn't adding python to the start of my thing the other day
2011-06-21T06:20:22  <Zaphus> can the output be redirected so that the input from the server goes to one file and the echo from my bot goes to another ?
2011-06-21T06:20:42  <george1914> i have berak's now
2011-06-21T06:21:28  <Rabidus> i write my debug info into a file
2011-06-21T06:21:30  <Zaphus> fyi - on windows, if you want to redirect to a file when running python, you *must* call it via   python file.py  -  if you just do   file.py   then it wont launch (only when redirecting output, it's documented somewhere)
2011-06-21T06:21:33  <antimatroid> damnit people, i want a game!
2011-06-21T06:21:37  <antimatroid> :p
2011-06-21T06:21:45  <Rabidus> :p
2011-06-21T06:21:51  <antimatroid> windows is the worst if you're a programmer
2011-06-21T06:22:24  <Zaphus> but not if you are a human being :-)
2011-06-21T06:23:02  <george1914> i must be a programmer then  :/    though not many others think so  :)
2011-06-21T06:24:01  <antimatroid> george1914: i didn't say it was necessary to be a programmer for windows to be the worst :P
2011-06-21T06:24:27  <george1914> the choice seemed to be 'human'  or  'programmer'
2011-06-21T06:24:36  <antimatroid> it's just painful to do a lot of stuff that's programming related on windows
2011-06-21T06:24:37  <Zaphus> what else is there ?  :-)
2011-06-21T06:24:53  <george1914> ai, but not programmer
2011-06-21T06:24:55  <george1914> ?
2011-06-21T06:25:01  <antimatroid> george1914: what do you do?
2011-06-21T06:25:33  <antimatroid> i wouldn't really class myself as a programmer either
2011-06-21T06:25:45  <antimatroid> recreational programmer maybe?
2011-06-21T06:26:28  <george1914> physics/maths person who writes  FORTRAN   (90)  in any other language ...
2011-06-21T06:26:42  <antimatroid> maths :), physics meh
2011-06-21T06:26:49  <antimatroid> :p
2011-06-21T06:28:02  <george1914> i did mostly maths problems,  but as a physicist   (the style is very different, even(especially) on the same problems)
2011-06-21T06:31:11  <george1914> so, i appear to be playing a game
2011-06-21T06:31:32  <george1914> but i get always INFO:  invalid: ['o 94 12 w\no 95 12 w # incorrectly formatted order']
2011-06-21T06:31:54  <george1914> though i think i should not (at least for 1of the bots i am running)
2011-06-21T06:32:24  <Zaphus> looks like unix line ending not being handled ?   I'm also getting invalid move messages that I've never seen on the live server
2011-06-21T06:33:06  <antimatroid> why aren't i playing a game? :(
2011-06-21T06:33:11  <antimatroid> it just says i'm waiting for 3 people
2011-06-21T06:33:12  <george1914> well, looks like we are testing it anyway  :)
2011-06-21T06:33:42  <george1914> i 'submitted'   6
2011-06-21T06:33:51  <george1914> to be sure of getting a game going
2011-06-21T06:33:58  <george1914> strangely, only 2 are playing
2011-06-21T06:34:09  <george1914> INFO: hello george_b, we still need 4 more players for the upcoming game.
2011-06-21T06:34:11  <george1914> etc
2011-06-21T06:34:23  <george1914> but then it seems just the last 2 submission are running

2011-06-21T06:36:56  <sir_macelon> what's better about your expanding? you mean food collection? :)

2011-06-21T06:37:39  <antimatroid> watch the ant/scores in the game near the start :P
2011-06-21T06:39:23  <antimatroid> it might have been more luck of search
2011-06-21T06:39:47  <antimatroid> sir_macelon: are you using a*?
2011-06-21T06:39:54  <antimatroid> i am using that for food collection

2011-06-21T06:40:58  <antimatroid> same^^
2011-06-21T06:41:01  <sir_macelon> as to that game, it's more about the exploration and luck, but yet i have just basic exploration implemented
2011-06-21T06:41:13  <Rabidus> where did you get that tcpclient.py ?
2011-06-21T06:41:20  <Rabidus> from uhiainen or from github?
2011-06-21T06:41:21  <sir_macelon> and still would have to work on it
2011-06-21T06:41:21  <george1914> well, problem starts once i get 2 ants
2011-06-21T06:41:28  <Zaphus> https://github.com/berak/TCPServer
2011-06-21T06:41:30  <antimatroid> yeah i did a fairly quick exploration thing yesterday
2011-06-21T06:41:31  <Rabidus> ok
2011-06-21T06:41:34  <george1914> and start submitting 2 lines of orders
2011-06-21T06:42:00  <Zaphus> socket error - I think it's not running any more perhaps ?
2011-06-21T06:42:35  <Rabidus> antimatroid is having socket errors
2011-06-21T06:42:42  <Zaphus> sir_macelon:  when I run all my old bots against each other, the ones with the better food searching always win - even if the others know how to fight (sortof)
2011-06-21T06:43:21  <Zaphus> reset the server perhaps (if it belongs to someone here)
2011-06-21T06:43:25  <antimatroid> sir_macelons bot walks all over mine when they go to fight each other
2011-06-21T06:44:02  <george1914> antimatroid: you have game now?
2011-06-21T06:44:23  <antimatroid> george1914: i do
2011-06-21T06:44:31  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: depends on the fighting skill, better food collection gives you an advantage and without good battling it might still be not enough to win
2011-06-21T06:44:31  <antimatroid> and i'm getting that invalid order stuff too
2011-06-21T06:44:39  <george1914> ah  :(
2011-06-21T06:44:48  <george1914> is it once you have 2 bots?
2011-06-21T06:44:52  <george1914> sorry, 2 ants
2011-06-21T06:45:17  <Rabidus> if you have solution for code i'll change it
2011-06-21T06:45:22  <mcstar> aerique: i re-wrote the missing part, when you try it out and something isnt working let me know
2011-06-21T06:45:24  <Zaphus> how's this for just winning:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28997&user=78    had a great lead, didnt know what to do with it and would have lost if it went to 2010 turns I think
2011-06-21T06:45:52  <antimatroid> george1914: yep
2011-06-21T06:48:29  <aerique> mcstar: will do

2011-06-21T06:52:52  <mcstar> when i see games like that, ideal gas and pressure comes into my mind
2011-06-21T06:53:20  <mcstar> well, yeah its not so ideal, diffusion is quite minimal
2011-06-21T06:53:48  <george1914> my ants follow Metropolis  Stat Mech   method,  (when it doesnt see any food)
2011-06-21T06:53:55  <george1914> potential has repulsion
2011-06-21T06:54:18  <george1914> so very like a gas ...
2011-06-21T06:54:24  <mcstar> is it for evaluating the zustandsumme?
2011-06-21T06:54:33  <mcstar> Z
2011-06-21T06:54:46  <george1914> :)
2011-06-21T06:54:52  <george1914> i guessed that
2011-06-21T06:55:12  <george1914> no,  was just a very cheap way to make ants move, and spread out
2011-06-21T06:55:13  <mcstar> i dont know much about it, but as far as ai can remmeber iz samples the space on which the partition function is defined, right?
2011-06-21T06:55:19  <george1914> better than totally random moves
2011-06-21T06:55:29  <george1914> yes
2011-06-21T06:56:01  <george1914> but i never reach equilibrium, because  sir-m  et al keep killing my ants ...
2011-06-21T06:56:30  <Zaphus> you need a bubble, gas inside with a membrane around the outside
2011-06-21T06:56:46  <Zaphus> good luck coding that :-)
2011-06-21T06:56:49  <mcstar> Zaphus: that kept you from killing david!
2011-06-21T06:56:59  <mcstar> you HAD a bubble :D
2011-06-21T06:57:13  * antimatroid doesn't understand these physicsy things 
2011-06-21T06:57:31  <antimatroid> pesky muggles
2011-06-21T06:57:49  <Zaphus> mcstar:  yes, but I had a bubble that was too afraid of losing a single ant, so never risked anything, and slowly got crushed
2011-06-21T06:57:51  <mcstar> now i have to look up muggles
2011-06-21T06:58:33  <mcstar> no luck with muggles, i feel stupid :(
2011-06-21T06:59:09  <antimatroid> mcstar: you might as well go and kill yourself
2011-06-21T06:59:49  <george1914> for not being able to use google?   a bit harsh ...
2011-06-21T06:59:51  <mcstar> well, i laughed at it, is it ok?
2011-06-21T07:00:02  <antimatroid> for not knowing what a muggle is
2011-06-21T07:00:11  <mcstar> noooo, i wont ude google for english, come on
2011-06-21T07:00:18  <mcstar> i use dictionaries
2011-06-21T07:00:35  <george1914> well, it needs to not predate harry potter books then ...
2011-06-21T07:00:35  <antimatroid> a muggle is someone with no magical abilities
2011-06-21T07:00:38  <Rabidus> i like turtles
2011-06-21T07:00:58  <mcstar> well, im certainly a muggle then
2011-06-21T07:01:07  <mcstar> but im not pesky, am i?
2011-06-21T07:01:26  <antimatroid> i was kidding :P
2011-06-21T07:01:37  <mcstar> now i see
2011-06-21T07:02:26  <mcstar> btw how you feel about talking to all of these people, these half wits in english, compared to you?
2011-06-21T07:03:05  <mcstar> i know if they were to speak hungarian, and if they made a mistake, i couldnt stand it
2011-06-21T07:03:18  <mcstar> i would yell at them
2011-06-21T07:04:17  <george1914> i am very happy i do not need to speak hungarian - english is hard enough for me, thanks   :)
2011-06-21T07:06:02  <george1914> it is fine - the only issue i have is my english accept is too strong for many/most foreigners - so when talking, i have to try hard to speak clearly, and separate words
2011-06-21T07:06:30  <george1914> after many years of this, i now have a very strange accent which people at home do not recognise
2011-06-21T07:06:47  <george1914> sorry,  'accxent'   not  'accept'
2011-06-21T07:06:49  <mcstar> you mean accent
2011-06-21T07:06:51  <george1914> no,  accent
2011-06-21T07:06:55  <george1914> right finally
2011-06-21T07:07:07  <Rabidus> finnish english is funny in most cases. it comes with separate words by default :p
2011-06-21T07:07:45  <Rabidus> you can search from youtube dudes like 'tommi mäkinen' or 'juha kankkunen'
2011-06-21T07:08:19  <mcstar> you mean a different vocabulary?
2011-06-21T07:08:39  <george1914> if it is not in a dictionary, mcstar wont accept it ...
2011-06-21T07:09:02  <mcstar> it is allowed for it to be in urban dictionary :D
2011-06-21T07:10:16  <george1914> now, back to tcp ...

2011-06-21T07:14:07  <Rabidus> it has jammed

2011-06-21T07:15:18  <Rabidus> so thats newline issue
2011-06-21T07:15:27  <Rabidus> i'll stop the server for now
2011-06-21T07:16:02  <george1914> and then in ants.py  parse_orders,  it complains because it expects each order to be just 4 words
2011-06-21T07:16:08  <Zaphus> george: are you on linux ?
2011-06-21T07:16:12  <george1914> yes
2011-06-21T07:16:30  <george1914> antimatroid is windows though, isnt he?
2011-06-21T07:16:30  <Zaphus> can you modify your code to send  \n\r   as a test (at the end of a line)
2011-06-21T07:16:42  <george1914> ok
2011-06-21T07:16:52  <Zaphus> (or is it \r\n  I can't remember)
2011-06-21T07:17:01  <antimatroid> george1914: nah i'm on ubuntu
2011-06-21T07:17:12  <antimatroid> mcstar: despite it being my first language, i'm not the best with english
2011-06-21T07:17:18  <antimatroid> i can usually make out what people are trying to say
2011-06-21T07:17:34  <Zaphus> I think it should be \r\n (CRLF)
2011-06-21T07:17:43  <Zaphus> that being said, the server should handle it
2011-06-21T07:17:50  <Rabidus> ok, i'll start it again
2011-06-21T07:18:19  <Rabidus> up
2011-06-21T07:19:29  <mcstar> who knows git-hub?
2011-06-21T07:19:40  <Zaphus> barely
2011-06-21T07:19:46  <antimatroid> i barely know anything too
2011-06-21T07:19:46  <mcstar> i modify my file, commit, then push
2011-06-21T07:19:58  <mcstar> and it seems that it wont update the file
2011-06-21T07:20:16  <antimatroid> it's probably done some separate branch or something
2011-06-21T07:20:29  <antimatroid> i dunno how to handle that kind of stuff
2011-06-21T07:21:30  <Zaphus> woah, just connected to the tcp server and it's sent me millions of blank lines
2011-06-21T07:21:42  <Rabidus> :o

2011-06-21T07:34:15  <stocha> mcstar: Muggle is term from those stories. It's not english most probably.

2011-06-21T07:34:37  <george1914> the move is valid (ie no water)   so i guess i have wrong syntax?

2011-06-21T07:35:24  <stocha> i think it might be that there is a film also, made out from the book.
2011-06-21T07:35:41  <stocha> mcstar: what can he do with audibooks ?
2011-06-21T07:35:49  <mcstar> he can shove it .....

2011-06-21T07:44:02  <mcstar> yeah, should have said me, instead of hungarians
2011-06-21T07:44:53  <mcstar> i dont know if i should say this or not

2011-06-21T07:46:03  <mcstar> but on a 2d array as well

2011-06-21T07:50:04  <Rabidus> yep
2011-06-21T07:50:12  <antimatroid> maybe it's trying to index as x,y somewhere
2011-06-21T07:50:20  <mcstar> and its close than the one on the other side of water
2011-06-21T07:50:25  <antimatroid> never use x,y for indexing, it only leads to confusion

2011-06-21T08:13:44  <Rabidus> ah, you have found the spot
2011-06-21T08:13:46  <Rabidus> i can try that
2011-06-21T08:14:16  <george1914> i dont know quite what to change it to - my python to fortran translator is poor ....
2011-06-21T08:15:00  <george1914> i guess it should do  '\r\n'  and then do '\n'    so maybe add a line?
2011-06-21T08:15:46  <mleise> and what about Mac ?
2011-06-21T08:15:54  <Rabidus> what's macs newline?
2011-06-21T08:15:57  <mleise> \r
2011-06-21T08:16:00  <Rabidus> fuu
2011-06-21T08:16:01  <mleise> hehe
2011-06-21T08:16:13  <Rabidus> i made it to .. wait a minute
2011-06-21T08:16:21  <mleise> the 3 companies were really smart in making it hard
2011-06-21T08:16:29  <Rabidus>  s.replace('\r','').split('\n')
2011-06-21T08:16:39  <Rabidus> so now it should work on windows and linux
2011-06-21T08:17:06  <antimatroid> george1914: why the love for fortran?
2011-06-21T08:17:08  <mleise> replace \r\n -> \n first, then \r -> \n :)

2011-06-21T08:17:53  <mleise> oh noes, not the annoying kid
2011-06-21T08:18:15  <george1914> long ago, when mathematica was too slow for my problem, i needed to write in something fast - my officemate knew F90, so i went for that - then i had someone to ask when i had questions.
2011-06-21T08:18:23  <george1914> and, i still like it
2011-06-21T08:18:37  <Rabidus> howbout s.replace('\r','\n').replace('\n\n','\n').split('\n')
2011-06-21T08:18:49  <Rabidus> bubblegum
2011-06-21T08:18:57  <Rabidus> but should work, shouldn't it ?
2011-06-21T08:19:08  <george1914> yes
2011-06-21T08:19:11  <george1914> thanks
2011-06-21T08:19:18  <Rabidus> i'll try and restart the server
2011-06-21T08:19:22  <george1914> want to do the change, then i test?
2011-06-21T08:19:27  <Rabidus> ok
2011-06-21T08:19:28  <george1914> ok
2011-06-21T08:19:31  <george1914> :)
2011-06-21T08:20:54  <Rabidus> up n running
2011-06-21T08:21:10  <mcstar> silence, Lisp is on the way!
2011-06-21T08:21:16  <mcstar> peasants...
2011-06-21T08:22:02  <mcstar> george1914: when i started using lisp in march, i realized i knew it all along
2011-06-21T08:22:07  <mcstar> it was called mathematica
2011-06-21T08:22:15  <mcstar> its a total rip-off
2011-06-21T08:23:00  <george1914> aha?  the thing is, i write fortran in mathematica also :)
2011-06-21T08:23:03  <Rabidus> george1914: is it working?
2011-06-21T08:23:21  <george1914> i have tried those clever Nest[...]   commands, and they confuse me
2011-06-21T08:23:22  <mcstar> well, i suppose you know FullForm[]
2011-06-21T08:23:54  <george1914> vaguely
2011-06-21T08:24:02  <george1914> i write Do[  loops
2011-06-21T08:24:04  <george1914> etc
2011-06-21T08:24:22  <mcstar> well, in mma every expression is a Head[arg1,....,argN]
2011-06-21T08:24:23  <george1914> and then do symbolic stuff when i am too dumb to use pencil and paper
2011-06-21T08:24:39  <mcstar> this is exactly how lisp look slike
2011-06-21T08:24:52  <mcstar> with the exception: (head arg1 .... argN)
2011-06-21T08:25:29  <mcstar> and of course mma doesnt have macros, but the power of the language comes from lisp, wolfram was studying lisp before the wrote mma
2011-06-21T08:25:47  <mleise> variadic arguments?
2011-06-21T08:25:55  <mcstar> btw maxima is written in lisp, but the syntax of that language is totally different
2011-06-21T08:26:13  <mcstar> mleise: what do you mean?
2011-06-21T08:26:23  <george1914> Rabidus:  yes, works fine  :)  thanks
2011-06-21T08:26:29  <Rabidus> wow, nice
2011-06-21T08:26:57  <mleise> mcstar: oh nothing, i just thought head arg1 ... argN looked like you take a look at the first given argument or something
2011-06-21T08:27:19  <mcstar> its just an abstract notation of a function call
2011-06-21T08:27:26  <george1914> BUT i have:      INFO:  ignored: ['o 12 56 n # move blocked']
2011-06-21T08:27:34  <george1914> even though no water reported ...
2011-06-21T08:27:39  <Rabidus> :o
2011-06-21T08:27:45  <mleise> lol
2011-06-21T08:27:53  <mleise> invisible walls, the new feature
2011-06-21T08:28:01  <george1914> i forget - do i always get told about water?  or just when i first see it?
2011-06-21T08:28:14  <mleise> only on first sight!
2011-06-21T08:28:28  <george1914> ok, then i cannot be sure there is no water there
2011-06-21T08:28:36  <mcstar> hehe, blind ants
2011-06-21T08:28:40  <mleise> your ants are very forgettable
2011-06-21T08:28:42  <mcstar> i like that
2011-06-21T08:28:45  <Rabidus> in previous games you were right next to water
2011-06-21T08:28:46  <george1914> not a mistake my bot has made before though ...
2011-06-21T08:29:35  <mleise> george1914: then I assume there was a big change in your code
2011-06-21T08:29:44  <Rabidus> http://uhiainen.dyndns.org:991/replay.2
2011-06-21T08:29:46  <Rabidus> over there
2011-06-21T08:29:52  <Rabidus> they all move few squares down
2011-06-21T08:29:58  <mleise> there is so much water.. at some point in the past it must have run into it
2011-06-21T08:30:00  <Rabidus> and then they hit into water
2011-06-21T08:30:38  <mleise> lol, what is with the status texts?
2011-06-21T08:30:44  <george1914> no, it is old version i am running here (in storeage directory) - ought to be fine
2011-06-21T08:30:48  <mleise> and what kind of server is this? Oo
2011-06-21T08:31:03  <Rabidus> tcp-tryout

2011-06-21T08:32:15  <mleise> I try to, yes
2011-06-21T08:32:20  <mcstar> +1
2011-06-21T08:33:08  <george1914> ok, well, the game ran, and can be viewed  :)
2011-06-21T08:33:24  <Rabidus> hehe
2011-06-21T08:33:27  <george1914> my bots seem to not know about some water, but then play more or less normally
2011-06-21T08:33:57  <mleise> You should change the page encoding to utf-8
2011-06-21T08:33:57  <george1914> so, anyone else want to submit bot(s)?
2011-06-21T08:34:10  <Rabidus> as soon as i can get away from my work
2011-06-21T08:34:33  <george1914> Rabidus is just trying out the code of berak
2011-06-21T08:34:57  <george1914> inperfections may not be his doing!
2011-06-21T08:35:06  <Rabidus> that utf8 thing is just line of a code in <head> tags?
2011-06-21T08:35:16  <mleise> yes, should be
2011-06-21T08:35:23  <Rabidus> yes, i'll do it then soon
2011-06-21T08:37:07  <mleise> interestingly firefox 5 is not released yet. hope they fix the regression bug(s), before millions of people upgrade
2011-06-21T08:38:10  <Guest55669> mleise: Oh god, firefox 5 has sooooooooooooo many bugs
2011-06-21T08:38:21  <george1914> ok, this last game - i am ~sure that the water was not reported correctly.
2011-06-21T08:38:23  <Guest55669> My graphics driver crashes once every hour because of it
2011-06-21T08:38:40  <Rabidus> hmm..
2011-06-21T08:39:00  <Rabidus> george1914: what the heck.. you didn't ran into water in last game
2011-06-21T08:39:07  <Rabidus> but now you did
2011-06-21T08:39:30  <mleise> Guest55669: i am kinda glad to hear that, because people wont hate me then when the visualizer looks ugly, but the mozilla crew :D
2011-06-21T08:39:36  * mcstar doesnt understand why would people use software that bleeds bugs

2011-06-21T08:40:02  <george1914> yes - both went north, but one couldnt move and the other ran into it  :)
2011-06-21T08:40:14  <Rabidus> yep, so water wasn't the issue
2011-06-21T08:40:18  <george1914> but, the terminal shows that no water was reported there
2011-06-21T08:40:24  <Rabidus> hmm..
2011-06-21T08:40:34  <george1914> -nve water was the issue - it was not reported to Bot
2011-06-21T08:40:47  <Rabidus> can't do anything on that
2011-06-21T08:40:48  <mleise> only to one bot??
2011-06-21T08:40:55  <george1914> do you think i drop a line of input from server?
2011-06-21T08:40:59  <mleise> is this an experimental engine?

2011-06-21T08:45:56  <Rabidus> for your eyes, but will it for bots eye?
2011-06-21T08:46:00  <george1914> maybe if another person ran a bot, then we could check it isnt me going mad?
2011-06-21T08:46:06  <Rabidus> :D
2011-06-21T08:46:16  <Rabidus> wait an hour and i'll run some test at home
2011-06-21T08:46:39  <Rabidus> hour or two
2011-06-21T08:47:02  <george1914> ok, thanks.   i will be away for a few hours soon, so maybe catch you later this evening

2011-06-21T08:47:55  <mleise> ok, so it uses a home-grown engine :)
2011-06-21T08:48:07  <Rabidus> afaik, yes.
2011-06-21T08:48:08  <Rabidus> :)
2011-06-21T08:55:15  <Rabidus> i think that \r\n -problem caused the server to use 100% cpu
2011-06-21T08:55:18  <Rabidus> it runs now fine
2011-06-21T08:55:26  <Rabidus> no games running tho

2011-06-21T10:30:25  <antimatroid> i haven't got that far for this yes
2011-06-21T10:30:40  <antimatroid> i'm just doing food collection, "enemy collection" and exploration

2011-06-21T10:34:01  <dr-> thanks answering my questions ;)
2011-06-21T10:36:58  <antimatroid> are other people tracking old food information?
2011-06-21T10:40:21  <aerique> not yet, is there a point to it?  perhaps a random number generator not working correctly :)

2011-06-21T10:42:19  <antimatroid> aerique: you can go back and collect food
2011-06-21T10:42:29  <antimatroid> watch some of my games, i think it's quite useful
2011-06-21T10:42:37  <antimatroid> eashoka: hello :)
2011-06-21T10:42:39  <dr-> i plan to do it
2011-06-21T10:42:49  <eashoka> why is the aichallenge forum page down and ai-contest.com site gone somewhere else ?
2011-06-21T10:43:11  <dr-> stock somewhere locations of seen food, with relevance attribute, decreasing over the time
2011-06-21T10:43:15  <antimatroid> eashoka: the main site is down for some reason, the beta site is just on a different server and not down
2011-06-21T10:43:53  <eashoka> looks like main site domain has got by someone else ?
2011-06-21T10:44:04  <antimatroid> dr-: it's relatively easy to make a copy of food information before clearing it, then going through that information after updating vision information to see what is food information at a not-currently visible square
2011-06-21T10:44:11  <antimatroid> eashoka: ?
2011-06-21T10:44:52  <dr-> I'll do something like that
2011-06-21T10:44:52  <eashoka> ai-contest.com goes to some Default Parells ?
2011-06-21T10:45:00  <antimatroid> i suspect that's just the page of the people hosting it normally or something
2011-06-21T10:45:05  <antimatroid> i don't know much about that kind of thing
2011-06-21T10:45:33  <eashoka> ah ok. hope everything is going fine then :-) tx.
2011-06-21T10:45:56  <eashoka> any idea when will the real site start ?
2011-06-21T10:46:12  <aerique> antimatroid: oh right, i thought you meant squares that used to have food
2011-06-21T10:46:45  <antimatroid> eashoka: hopefully not too far away
2011-06-21T10:47:05  <aerique> antimatroid: yeah, i'm not planning to throw that info away unless i can see that square again and can confirm the food is gone
2011-06-21T10:47:26  <antimatroid> aerique: what i suggested above does that

2011-06-21T11:43:21  <antimatroid> well, it took me way longer to get the strategy
2011-06-21T11:43:26  <antimatroid> but i implemented it in a few hours

2011-06-21T13:23:44  <Rabidus> whoo, it works now
2011-06-21T13:23:56  <berak> i've seen some missing water, too, in different turns

2011-06-21T13:24:14  <george1914> it think this from looking at my bot's python inputs   (does not mention water on turn 1, even though it is there)
2011-06-21T13:24:34  <berak> yes.

2011-06-21T13:26:34  <berak> it might have been due to that '\r', '\r\n' '\n' thing, maybe the lines werent properly split, so that ants.py did not see all the ants/orders

2011-06-21T13:28:37  <george1914> hm,  but on turn 1 the Bots have sent no orders, so it is the server side that must be wrong,   or else the server map info is going missing in  tcpclient.py

2011-06-21T13:47:34  <mcstar> i mean isnt it easier to add a bit of code to the existing engine?
2011-06-21T13:47:42  <mcstar> than to use a rewrite?
2011-06-21T13:49:32  <berak> i couldn't imagine how to do it with those sandboxes, given that the engine can't "create" a bot in this tcp situation, but have
2011-06-21T13:49:49  <berak> to wait for a client connecting
2011-06-21T13:50:02  <mcstar> the sandbox is not used by default i think
2011-06-21T13:50:08  <smiley1983> george1914: yes, I was at first thinking "just wait, surely my bot is checking whether moves are blocked or not", then I saw your message and was also glad it wasn't just me :)
2011-06-21T13:50:26  <smiley1983> berak: the \n vs \r\n does seem to be solved (at least for my bot)
2011-06-21T13:50:35  <smiley1983> which uses \n
2011-06-21T13:50:54  <mcstar> berak: so the sandbox is definitely not an issue, and consider that that engine is more or less perfectly debugged
2011-06-21T13:51:36  <mcstar> but McLeopold is here and could share his expert opinion on this ....
2011-06-21T13:51:56  <smiley1983> by the way, thanks again for doing the work to get this up and running :)

2011-06-21T13:53:12  <McLeopold> you could write a sandbox class that does the tcp work, then you can use the same engine
2011-06-21T13:53:28  <berak> mcstar, engine can't start a tcp game at will, think of it, you have to get the socket connetions int it somehow
2011-06-21T13:53:38  <mcstar> see berak? now you only have to type a bit

2011-06-21T13:54:41  <mcstar> im not familiar with that architecture
2011-06-21T13:57:35  <McLeopold> The engine calls functions on the sandbox class, pause, resume, kill, write, read, etc.  You just need a class to implement those functions.
2011-06-21T13:57:54  <McLeopold> The class itself can then talk to the tcp socket

2011-06-21T14:00:54  <McLeopold> so, the work done in playgame inside the rounds loop would still need to be done somewhere, when you have enough tcp connections for a game
2011-06-21T14:01:32  <McLeopold> What we should do is make the engine accept a list of classes instead of bot commands

2011-06-21T18:32:42  <Zaphus> both those changes are to that file
2011-06-21T18:32:43  <amstan_> wait, it's just a matchup problem?
2011-06-21T18:32:58  <amstan_> then i only have to worry about the server
2011-06-21T18:32:58  <Zaphus> "just"  :-)
2011-06-21T18:33:15  <_flag> There is only 1 match being played right now; over and over again
2011-06-21T18:33:26  <Zaphus> yeah, sorry, I thought we said it was the server

2011-06-21T18:37:15  <amstan_> Zaphus: i could resubmit you, lol
2011-06-21T18:37:39  <Zaphus> amstan_  flag resubmitted, it kept playing his old submission !?!
2011-06-21T18:37:39  <_flag> I already resubmitted but the server kept playing my old bot
2011-06-21T18:37:51  <amstan_> Zaphus: i mean after this
2011-06-21T18:38:07  <Zaphus> amstan:  damn :-)
2011-06-21T18:38:39  <Zaphus> amstan_  good thing about TrueSkill is it just reacts to the last game, so it doesnt take long to recover from odd behaviour
2011-06-21T18:39:14  <_flag> Well the sigma is relatively low now, so it still might take awhile
2011-06-21T18:39:35  <Zaphus> 30830 is still the same match, but it may have started before you did the change
2011-06-21T18:40:17  <McLeopold> I'm watching the database table, a a new matchup has been created.
2011-06-21T18:40:31  <amstan_> 30830 is timestamped at 2:38
2011-06-21T18:40:34  <amstan_> it's 2:40 now
2011-06-21T18:40:56  <McLeopold> matchup id 78201 got handed out
2011-06-21T18:42:42  <Zaphus> 30831 is different - yay !   now to make sure the next one is different again :-)
2011-06-21T18:42:44  <_flag> New game!

2011-06-21T18:43:34  <Zaphus> yep, looking good.   and by not being those 5 the games are fast again :-)
2011-06-21T18:43:41  <amstan_> McLeopold: what?
2011-06-21T18:43:59  <amstan_> McLeopold: you want to go back to head?

2011-06-21T18:44:31  <_flag> Zaphus: Yup, I'm following it closely
2011-06-21T18:44:33  <amstan_> git checkout master

2011-06-21T18:53:48  <amstan_> no dice
2011-06-21T18:53:50  <McLeopold> on the server side you need ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2

2011-06-21T20:32:53  <janzert> after doing a git pull to get the new code on the beta server then run "./create_worker_archive.py ../website"
2011-06-21T20:32:59  <janzert> to update the worker archive
2011-06-21T20:33:02  <janzert> I'll do it now
2011-06-21T20:33:08  <McLeopold> oh
2011-06-21T20:33:23  <McLeopold> why do we need that?
2011-06-21T20:33:24  <antimatroid> amstan: yeah...?
2011-06-21T20:33:37  <amstan> antimatroid: we'll just get it up when we have the new server
2011-06-21T20:33:38  <janzert> it creates the tarball that the worker gets it's code from
2011-06-21T20:33:46  <McLeopold> why not just pull from git?
2011-06-21T20:34:02  <janzert> so you know what your workers are running
2011-06-21T20:34:24  <McLeopold> I'd prefer git over a tarball
2011-06-21T20:34:25  <janzert> ok, terminating current workers now
2011-06-21T20:34:50  <janzert> the tarball is a "git archive" command
2011-06-21T20:35:13  <McLeopold> okay, i meant github over a tarball
2011-06-21T20:35:42  <janzert> I'd rather we only pulled at known times from github
2011-06-21T20:35:59  <McLeopold> we could create an update task that had the version guid
2011-06-21T20:36:41  <McLeopold> Okay, all stop now, it works
2011-06-21T20:36:52  <janzert> i.e. I really want all pulls from github to be manual human action ;)
2011-06-21T20:37:19  * janzert tries to remember and find the right ec2 command line :P
2011-06-21T20:38:34  <janzert> gah, it was the first command I recalled but missed seeing in the list of commands
2011-06-21T20:39:28  <janzert> oh if you want to clear the worker table do it quick
2011-06-21T20:39:32  <janzert> I forgot you wanted to
2011-06-21T20:39:35  <McLeopold> already done
2011-06-21T20:39:38  <janzert> ok
2011-06-21T20:40:16  <McLeopold> I'm liking the game cutoff code.  Watch the next few games go through when the worker is up.
2011-06-21T20:40:55  <janzert> great, did you see earlier where I gave the average game length?
2011-06-21T20:41:01  <McLeopold> no
2011-06-21T20:41:05  <janzert> it was 800 and something
2011-06-21T20:41:32  <McLeopold> In my tests, the cutoff happened just above 1000 most often.
2011-06-21T20:41:52  <McLeopold> Plus, we cut off games where bots don't gather food really early.
2011-06-21T20:41:55  <janzert> I haven't started on a histogram or what the say 90th percentile is yet
2011-06-21T20:41:59  <janzert> hope to do that tonight
2011-06-21T20:42:18  <janzert> what are is the cutoff metric currently?
2011-06-21T20:42:25  <McLeopold> With the cutoff code, I don't think we need to worry about game length.
2011-06-21T20:42:53  <McLeopold> must hold 90% of population for 100 turns.  population includes food.  food can win :)
2011-06-21T20:43:03  <janzert> heh
2011-06-21T20:43:04  <janzert> ok
2011-06-21T20:43:29  <janzert> I was worried that 90%/100 might be too aggressive but it will be a good test
2011-06-21T20:43:35  <McLeopold> meaning if there is 90% more food than all other ants for 100 turns, the bots are declared stupid and we don't care to run the game
2011-06-21T20:43:45  <janzert> :)
2011-06-21T20:43:52  <janzert> fine with me
2011-06-21T20:44:07  <McLeopold> with food in the population, it naturally makes the 90% harder to acheive
2011-06-21T20:44:34  <McLeopold> In looking at the games, we could probably even lower it some.
2011-06-21T20:46:55  <janzert> I take it you haven't looked into what is going on with pairing yet?
2011-06-21T20:47:05  <McLeopold> I have
2011-06-21T20:47:11  <McLeopold> It should be all fixed now.
2011-06-21T20:47:13  <janzert> ahh, find the cause?
2011-06-21T20:47:14  <janzert> ok

2011-06-21T20:47:49  <janzert> mind if https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Occupied-battle-resolution-narrative goes into the top of your explanation page?
2011-06-21T20:48:07  <McLeopold> It needs to go in somewhere.  I'm not sure if the top is good.
2011-06-21T20:48:34  <janzert> I was thinking the narrative could lead into the slightly more technical explanation
2011-06-21T20:48:35  <McLeopold> were we going to change the name to something else?
2011-06-21T20:48:47  <janzert> it doesn't matter too much to me
2011-06-21T20:49:10  <janzert> attention or distracted are the alternate candidates that sound best to me
2011-06-21T20:50:28  <McLeopold> torrmented? engrossed?
2011-06-21T20:52:58  <janzert> antimatroid: any thoughts? ^^
2011-06-21T20:53:30  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-occupied-battle-resolution-method is now the definitive guide :P
2011-06-21T20:54:13  <janzert> we just need some not quite so deeply entrenched in it and with writing ability to fill it all out :/
2011-06-21T20:54:51  <janzert> new workers are coming up now, should be running in about 8-10 minutes
2011-06-21T20:54:58  <janzert> and I gotta run for an hour or so
2011-06-21T20:55:17  <amstan> "although the details aren't completely known it involves much flailing of legs" XD
2011-06-21T20:57:11  <antimatroid> janzert: i don't mind either way :)
2011-06-21T21:05:06  <antimatroid> amstan: could a copy of the pw leaderboard stuff go up online somewhere before it all gets cleared
2011-06-21T21:05:33  <amstan> antimatroid: i don't intend to loose that data, i'll try to get the whole site up somewhere
2011-06-21T21:05:38  <amstan> i just need jeff to be more cooperative
2011-06-21T21:05:43  <antimatroid> :) cheers
2011-06-21T21:05:53  <amstan> same for tron and rps

2011-06-21T22:08:14  <janzert> amstan: are you familiar with how the manager script is being run on the server?
2011-06-21T22:08:39  <amstan> janzert: ./manager -t -n 0 or something like that
2011-06-21T22:08:45  <amstan> swap the t and n if it doesn't work
2011-06-21T22:09:14  <janzert> I mean in a screen session somewhere I assume, I only see one for the worker though?
2011-06-21T22:09:42  <amstan> you might want to try screen -r contest/worker
2011-06-21T22:10:58  <janzert> found it
2011-06-21T22:11:29  <janzert> manager is in one window of that session and worker in the other

2011-06-21T22:17:58  <janzert> I'm thinking I could bring up a small ec2 instance that would give us less cpu power but more memory than the current one, if we need to switch
2011-06-21T22:18:33  <janzert> and it won't cost a whole month if we get to a permanent server in less time
