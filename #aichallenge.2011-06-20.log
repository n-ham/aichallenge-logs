2011-06-20T03:54:28  <mleise> anyway 'debug painter' got quite a bit faster. I'm still worried about the speed with several layers of debug info though.

2011-06-20T03:56:08  <antimatroid> mleise: did you see my wtf comment about c++ and priority_queues?
2011-06-20T03:56:17  <mleise> no, where?
2011-06-20T03:56:27  <mleise> priority_queues are cool.
2011-06-20T03:56:30  <antimatroid> priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > t, t.top() returns the least element in the queue
2011-06-20T03:56:31  <antimatroid> priority_queue<int, vector<int>, less<int> > t, t.top() returns the greatest element in the queue
2011-06-20T03:56:33  <mleise> I used them in java
2011-06-20T03:57:05  <antimatroid> that makes no sense to me :\
2011-06-20T03:57:06  <mleise> you mean the sorting is wrong?
2011-06-20T03:57:20  <antimatroid> well, wouldn't you expect it to be the other way around?
2011-06-20T03:57:35  <mleise> D has the same 'issue' :p . Yes, you are right
2011-06-20T03:57:46  <antimatroid> is there a reasonable explanation as to why?
2011-06-20T03:58:10  <mleise> I don't know :(
2011-06-20T03:58:25  <mleise> let me check Java's queues
2011-06-20T03:58:39  <antimatroid> i will cry if they're more reasonable about something
2011-06-20T03:59:30  <mleise> The head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering.
2011-06-20T04:00:23  <mleise> and that would by default be the natural ordering, which is... now im confused
2011-06-20T04:01:10  <mleise> a < b -> 1,2,3,4,5
2011-06-20T04:01:19  <Rabidus> antimatroid: why don't you make a struct vector where you assign a priority number into the struct and then sort that vector by priority number?
2011-06-20T04:01:23  <Rabidus> or am i missing something?
2011-06-20T04:01:28  <mleise> that seems right to me. so Java is doing it the other way round
2011-06-20T04:01:58  <antimatroid> Rabidus: isn't that what a priority queue is? i'm just peeved at the counterintuitive way it's done in c++
2011-06-20T04:02:30  <antimatroid> i really have a priority_queue of search information
2011-06-20T04:03:54  <antimatroid> I have ie. struct FoodSearch, with operator> defined on FoodSearch, then priority_queue<FoodSearch, vector<FoodSearch>, greater<int> >

2011-06-20T04:39:32  <stocha> looking at the beta server, vs my own framework, i have this strong feeling that you should at least try some* assymetric maps.
2011-06-20T04:40:07  <stocha> i mean, my measure of strength were as precise as the test server. (though arguably you *might need a litle bit more sampling)
2011-06-20T04:40:22  <stocha> then the assymetric maps, feels much more diverse.
2011-06-20T04:40:56  <stocha> it's actually intersting to watch. When the test server is kinda of boring like hell;

2011-06-20T04:54:10  <antimatroid> and there are bugs all over the show ;)
2011-06-20T04:55:22  <stocha> you have rank 6th ...
2011-06-20T04:56:58  <stocha> seems you added some spreading code :p
2011-06-20T04:58:35  <antimatroid> i did :P
2011-06-20T04:58:56  <antimatroid> i collect food with a*, then enemies with a* then non-visible squares with bfs
2011-06-20T04:59:19  <stocha> a* only for food ?
2011-06-20T04:59:27  <antimatroid> and for enemies
2011-06-20T04:59:33  <stocha> it seems you have a rebound mechanisms for food :p
2011-06-20T05:01:16  <stocha> stilly game (leading bots crashed.  While coward bot will finally take them out )  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28482&user=126
2011-06-20T05:01:34  <antimatroid> rebound mechanisms?
2011-06-20T05:01:57  <stocha> yeah i call rebound, when you use a yet to spawn ant to do something.
2011-06-20T05:02:14  <antimatroid> ah yeah, i do that
2011-06-20T05:02:19  <antimatroid> and where my ant will be in the future
2011-06-20T05:02:19  <stocha> for example rebound greedy food (you assigne closest ant to food, but can use yet to spawn ants)
2011-06-20T05:02:38  <antimatroid> i still have a few tweaks to do to food collection, but the barebones are there
2011-06-20T05:02:48  <antimatroid> it's doing a* with multiple sources and multiple targets
2011-06-20T05:03:01  <stocha> you do a full solver, or only do partial ?
2011-06-20T05:03:13  <antimatroid> what do you mean by full?
2011-06-20T05:03:30  <antimatroid> i restart the search each iteration, finding the ant that can collect a piece of food the fastest
2011-06-20T05:03:39  <stocha> i mean, you do it like recursively    vs   doing it for next 10 turns.
2011-06-20T05:03:56  <antimatroid> next 10 turns?
2011-06-20T05:04:01  <antimatroid> i just collect every piece of food
2011-06-20T05:04:21  <stocha> You do that with the optimal gathering, or just an approximation ?
2011-06-20T05:04:36  <antimatroid> define optimal gathering?
2011-06-20T05:05:16  <stocha> it's the shortest time to food, with the least ant used (with non traffic congestion handling)
2011-06-20T05:05:36  <stocha> no traffic congestion handling
2011-06-20T05:05:45  <antimatroid> i have no traffic congestion handling
2011-06-20T05:05:50  <stocha> then you have the shortest time to food, least ant assigned, with traffic congestion :p
2011-06-20T05:06:07  <stocha> how much cpu does the fooding need ?
2011-06-20T05:06:13  <stocha> is it what makes you time out ?
2011-06-20T05:06:15  <antimatroid> not sure
2011-06-20T05:06:24  <antimatroid> it shouldn't time out at all
2011-06-20T05:06:29  <antimatroid> it has the timer checking for that
2011-06-20T05:06:34  <stocha> i think sir_macelon also use a rebound mechanisms
2011-06-20T05:06:36  <antimatroid> like i said, it's quite buggy :P
2011-06-20T05:07:20  <stocha> I corrected the known obvious bug in my framework. i may work a new generation of bot, if i have time and mood.
2011-06-20T05:07:49  <stocha> I'm unsure of what to do about combat though.
2011-06-20T05:08:22  <stocha> for non combat related, i have a few idea, and nothing more. But i guess it would make the bot stronger.
2011-06-20T05:08:46  <antimatroid> yeah, i've figured out most things bar combat
2011-06-20T05:08:51  <stocha> Mainly i have to build a scheduling framework
2011-06-20T05:09:35  <stocha> maybe i'll first try to do that, and only then see how i can use it to be in the 3 best bot around :p
2011-06-20T05:11:45  <stocha> i see two possible kind of scheduler. Light (ants have goal, and an expected time of arrival) and heavy. (ants has goal, and a timed precise path)
2011-06-20T05:12:03  <stocha> How many people in there have scheduler ? who plans on building a heavy one ?
2011-06-20T05:13:17  <stocha> i guess i'm speaking loud. Given out my ideas :p    I guess having good ideas and speaking them louds randomly feels better than winning a such contest.
2011-06-20T05:16:07  <stocha> For now, i like my map generator better (pure assymetric : random walk with random land mass, and pure random first ant spawn on a empty land). Then for food, i go with a food spawn speed from 0 to 200 (0 being no food, and  0-100 percentage of a food spawning during a turn. And 100-200  100% chance of spawning one food, and partial chances to spawn a second one). Then i have a set percentage of ground map as initial food (from

2011-06-20T05:17:57  <stocha> We need as simple and efficient map generation scheme, at least for 20% of the maps.
2011-06-20T05:18:15  <stocha> so i would suggest to just use this one with a 20% chance for each game.
2011-06-20T05:19:44  <stocha> We could use the map generation scheme to find intersting upper bounds.

2011-06-20T06:09:11  <stocha> over all, the sir_macelon is the bot that convinced me the most.

2011-06-20T06:11:05  <stocha> Zaphus: ?
2011-06-20T06:11:24  <Zaphus> just thought it was interesting (apart from the timeout)
2011-06-20T06:11:41  <Zaphus> and it's the digestion algorithm (I guess)
2011-06-20T06:13:25  <stocha> Zaphus: true this is an intresting game, for showing the internals of the sir_macelon bot :p
2011-06-20T06:13:43  <stocha> I'm sure he will not be happy that his code is exposed so well :p
2011-06-20T06:14:31  <Zaphus> it's an interesting behaviour, works pretty well
2011-06-20T06:14:59  <stocha> to be faire the maps do not have a large variety.
2011-06-20T06:15:13  <stocha> for example, sir_macelon might well do bad in more open maps.
2011-06-20T06:15:22  <Rabidus> this ai-challenge will be intresting
2011-06-20T06:15:26  <stocha> (although the food collection is pretty good, so it might still do well :p )
2011-06-20T06:15:39  <Rabidus> next few weeks will be interesting

2011-06-20T07:39:38  <antimatroid> george1914: when i move an ant towards a not visible square, before searching with the rest of my unmoved ants, i'll update the vision information around the square i was moving the ant towards
2011-06-20T07:39:49  <antimatroid> so it doesn't send another ant right near that point

2011-06-20T07:44:06  <antimatroid> i have a c++ question
2011-06-20T07:44:13  <antimatroid> how can i check if something is in a set?
2011-06-20T07:44:15  <antimatroid> there is count?
2011-06-20T07:44:33  <antimatroid> but surely an elem function would be faster, because it could stop once it found a single instance
2011-06-20T07:45:14  <jbroman> antimatroid: std::set only allows 1.
2011-06-20T07:45:21  <jbroman> It's called "count" for consistency, I think.
2011-06-20T07:45:30  <antimatroid> ah fair enough, sillyness
2011-06-20T07:45:31  <jbroman> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/set/count/
2011-06-20T07:45:41  <antimatroid> c++ is full of wacky stuff for me lately
2011-06-20T07:45:54  <antimatroid> i still think the priority queue thing is retarded
2011-06-20T07:46:23  <george1914> i saw some comments yesterday about an experimental tcp server ...
2011-06-20T07:46:31  <antimatroid> not fully functional sorry
2011-06-20T07:47:30  <george1914> right,  i am a bit paranoid - was wanting to use it rather than the beta - not that i have any clever code just yet, but ...
2011-06-20T07:47:41  <george1914> i guess i should wait ...
2011-06-20T07:47:43  <mcstar> you can have a vactor or whatever you call it in c++ and have it always sorted, so that an elem function could be efficient
2011-06-20T07:48:24  <jbroman> mcstar: He just doesn't like the name "top" for the first element of a priority queue.
2011-06-20T07:48:41  <george1914> antimatroid: i have implemented a* also - though maybe not so well - sometimes it is slower than bfs,  and usually just gives me a factor of 2 or 3 speedup ...
2011-06-20T07:48:43  <mcstar> i see
2011-06-20T07:49:13  <antimatroid> george1914: are you doing it with all food as targets?
2011-06-20T07:49:16  <george1914> i have mainly gone for calculating useful distances etc when i see new squares, and stroing that for lookup ...
2011-06-20T07:49:20  <antimatroid> i'm using "future ant location information" too
2011-06-20T07:49:50  <george1914> antimatroid: no - just    calcDistance(loc1,loc2)
2011-06-20T07:50:01  <antimatroid> jbroman: top isn't my priority queue problem
2011-06-20T07:50:02  <george1914> you seem to be doing cleverer stuff ...

2011-06-20T07:51:55  <mcstar> it its sorted by >, than the last is the smallest element
2011-06-20T07:52:09  <antimatroid> why?
2011-06-20T07:52:34  <mcstar> cause the vector consists of a,b,c; and a>b, b>c
2011-06-20T07:52:39  <mcstar> so c is the smallest one
2011-06-20T07:52:54  <mcstar> top, is the last element
2011-06-20T07:53:25  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2011-06-20T07:53:31  <mcstar> greater or less is the operation that leaves a properly ordered vector invariant

2011-06-20T09:03:06  <mcstar> i realized theres not going to be a bot written in bash
2011-06-20T09:04:00  <mcstar> bash is powerful, cause it can use any utility that accept stdin, but it also means that a new process is spawned every time we use cat/bc/awk/sed
2011-06-20T09:04:13  <mcstar> maybe for even echo, im not sure about that
2011-06-20T09:05:00  <mcstar> oh, yeah, even for $() a new process is started
2011-06-20T09:05:08  <mcstar> hell, it definitely wont work

2011-06-20T09:31:51  <stocha> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding no mention of any bfs that i can find
2011-06-20T09:31:59  <george1914> stocha: i guess you know it  is   breadth first search ...
2011-06-20T09:32:35  <mcstar> there it is, on the right
2011-06-20T09:32:37  <george1914> for a*,   that is the only name i know for it
2011-06-20T09:32:44  <mcstar> and its written as A*
2011-06-20T09:32:51  <stocha> i'm non native english speaker, AND i'm a computer more by doing than by learning :)
2011-06-20T09:32:56  <mcstar> A* is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm
2011-06-20T09:33:16  <george1914> a much cleverer variant though ...
2011-06-20T09:33:44  <mcstar> those arent my words, i just pasted as a proof for stocha
2011-06-20T09:33:51  <mcstar> who isnt using c anymore
2011-06-20T09:34:30  <george1914> stocha:  if you are computer, then i guess you would be a non-native english speaker :)
2011-06-20T09:35:17  <stocha> A* i was pointed to a long time ago. Everyone bothering to talk in there seems to be willing to use it. Although i found absolutely no use of it in this game yet.
2011-06-20T09:35:52  <george1914> i have a*,  was a few times faster than bfs, usually
2011-06-20T09:35:56  <stocha> Maybe as a late optimization of pathfinding. That's a maybe.
2011-06-20T09:36:04  <george1914> though maybe i should have implemented it more efficiently
2011-06-20T09:36:13  <mcstar> im just think about pathfinding now
2011-06-20T09:36:21  <Accoun> http://ai-contest.com/  down
2011-06-20T09:36:26  <stocha> unless you bot time out a lot because of it, i see no use for clever pathfinding.
2011-06-20T09:36:41  <mcstar> my algorith works as far as theres a clear view to the target :)
2011-06-20T09:36:44  <stocha> i doubt pathfinding will be the bottleneck for me.

2011-06-20T09:38:44  <mcstar> i beleive stoche will win this contest, i told him to use wikipedia :D

2011-06-20T09:39:55  <Rabidus> or watch dead forum
2011-06-20T09:44:33  <mcstar> lol, on this metric, i beleive for pathfinding i only need to consider the overlap of specific rectangles
2011-06-20T09:45:20  <mcstar> the planned path is usually in viewradius anyway

2011-06-20T09:52:18  <george1914> can i ask about battle resolution rule?    'An ant lives if it has less enemies in range than each of those enemies have in range.'   - can i replace the word 'each of' with  'every one of'?
2011-06-20T09:52:49  <mcstar> each and every
2011-06-20T09:52:53  <mcstar> i beleive
2011-06-20T09:53:02  <george1914> ok, that is clear, thanks
2011-06-20T09:53:15  <mcstar> ask antimatroid he wrote that part
2011-06-20T09:53:38  <george1914> and attackradius=5 means   distance^2  <=  5   ?    (it is the =   in <=  i am unsure about)
2011-06-20T09:53:51  <mcstar> <=
2011-06-20T09:54:03  <george1914> ok, thanks
2011-06-20T09:54:24  <george1914> does this rule seem to be fixed now?
2011-06-20T09:54:57  <mcstar> someone else should answer that, but it seems to me its gonna be final
2011-06-20T09:56:06  <george1914> yes, i guess cannot say 100%,  but if it is most likely final then i might go and write my battlecode ..   thanks for the info.

2011-06-20T12:27:56  <janzert> yes, it's known Accoun and will probably remain down for another 10 hours
2011-06-20T12:29:18  <mcstar> janzert: it is a bot, dont talk to it
2011-06-20T12:30:42  <sigh> but we talk to contestbot

2011-06-20T12:58:51  <janzert> McLeopold: that fix seems to mean games in progress are now ignored for choosing a seed?
2011-06-20T12:59:03  <janzert> seems the opposite of what we want
2011-06-20T12:59:09  <McLeopold> no, not quite
2011-06-20T12:59:22  <McLeopold> I'm glad you're here, cause we need to discuss it :)
2011-06-20T12:59:26  <janzert> :)
2011-06-20T12:59:30  <McLeopold> worker is positive if a game is in progress
2011-06-20T12:59:39  * amstan is listening if i'm needed
2011-06-20T12:59:44  <McLeopold> worker is negative if the game crashed

2011-06-20T13:00:24  <janzert> still not seeing how the previous led to multiple games with the same seed?
2011-06-20T13:00:26  <McLeopold> so, if a game is scheduled to worker 7, but it never reports back and just dies, then the matchup table stays positive, and the seed player never gets seeded again

2011-06-20T13:01:09  <janzert> tasks are never rescheduled after a certain time?
2011-06-20T13:01:09  <McLeopold> too many seeds were excluded from being chosen because there are a ton of errored matchups
2011-06-20T13:01:41  <McLeopold> tasks need to be rescheduled, that's what I want to discuss, what's the best way?
2011-06-20T13:02:00  <McLeopold> we need a max time for matches to be reported
2011-06-20T13:02:10  * antimatroid might have to be terrible and miss the meeting later
2011-06-20T13:02:18  <janzert> before if a task had been scheduled for more than x time it was resent as a task again
2011-06-20T13:02:54  <McLeopold> the manager code can reset matchup worker_id's to null if the game hasn't been reported for awhile
2011-06-20T13:02:58  <janzert> before it was something like 15 minutes, but of course the time out needs to be longer than the maximum time a game can take
2011-06-20T13:03:25  <McLeopold> it only needs to be slightly shorted than the time it takes to rotate through the list of seeds maybe?
2011-06-20T13:04:06  <janzert> I'd go for just longer than a game can take
2011-06-20T13:04:25  <McLeopold> our theoretical max is 5 hours...
2011-06-20T13:04:30  <McLeopold> ish
2011-06-20T13:04:55  <janzert> if we were running serial right now right?
2011-06-20T13:04:56  <janzert> :)
2011-06-20T13:04:59  <janzert> but we're not
2011-06-20T13:05:14  <janzert> also I wouldn't put it in the manager
2011-06-20T13:05:31  <McLeopold> the manager should be doing everything needing to be scheduled

2011-06-20T13:06:12  <janzert> I'd just add it as part of the where clause in the task selection
2011-06-20T13:06:26  <janzert> where worker_id is null or timestamp >= blah ...
2011-06-20T13:06:32  <janzert> <=
2011-06-20T13:06:43  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-06-20T13:06:55  <McLeopold> yeah, then it could also update the worker_id
2011-06-20T13:07:04  <janzert> compile tasks should be rescheduled in the same way
2011-06-20T13:07:06  <McLeopold> so, another change might be needed
2011-06-20T13:07:29  <janzert> I see they're a separate table
2011-06-20T13:07:29  <computerwiz_222> did I hear that there will be a launch meeting?
2011-06-20T13:07:32  <McLeopold> I'm sorting by game_id next for picking the seed, but game_id is based on when a game was reported, not started
2011-06-20T13:08:06  <McLeopold> I'm thinking I need to change the logic to be a little more fair
2011-06-20T13:08:23  <janzert> I don't think the difference will be significant
2011-06-20T13:08:26  <McLeopold> Otherwise bots in games that take a long time get seeded less often over time
2011-06-20T13:09:11  <janzert> also are they seeded by last game they played in or last game they were seed?
2011-06-20T13:09:19  <McLeopold> If I keep the matchup records around, and store the game_id in them, I can do it
2011-06-20T13:09:24  <McLeopold> last game they were seeded in
2011-06-20T13:09:40  <janzert> ok, next question then is why? ;)
2011-06-20T13:09:55  <McLeopold> why order by game_id?
2011-06-20T13:09:57  <janzert> I vaguely remember discussing it but don't remember the reasoning
2011-06-20T13:10:07  <janzert> why not order by last game they played in
2011-06-20T13:10:22  <janzert> why does being the seed make a difference
2011-06-20T13:11:07  <McLeopold> I can't think of a reason :)
2011-06-20T13:11:15  <McLeopold> I'm pretty sure you made me do it :)
2011-06-20T13:11:22  <janzert> heh, neither can I at the moment at least
2011-06-20T13:12:08  * janzert goes to find the wiki page on game scheduling
2011-06-20T13:12:26  <antimatroid> janzert: i haven't found games take all that long with an agressiveish bot
2011-06-20T13:12:58  <janzert> antimatroid: that's what I've noticed as well
2011-06-20T13:13:10  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/TrueSkill-Matchmaking/80c87a3eb941e2d5f1256c26994b5dd30fe88d42
2011-06-20T13:13:19  <janzert> McLeopold: yep, looking at it now
2011-06-20T13:13:28  <McLeopold> that's a past version, btww
2011-06-20T13:13:53  <janzert> oh, was looking at most recent
2011-06-20T13:14:04  <antimatroid> janzert: have you talked to McLeopold about the idea of "calling the game off early" ?
2011-06-20T13:14:08  <janzert> most recent shows, ordering by last played
2011-06-20T13:14:26  <janzert> antimatroid: not really, but I assume he saw the conversation since he filed an issue
2011-06-20T13:14:41  <McLeopold> I never liked all the changes bss03 put in there.  But I'll give him props for the trueskill formulas.
2011-06-20T13:15:02  * McLeopold waves at antimatroid
2011-06-20T13:15:14  <antimatroid> :P
2011-06-20T13:15:29  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/TrueSkill-Matchmaking/c6b2a9882b686d84d40dd390f3488a6aa938982c
2011-06-20T13:15:53  <janzert> pretty sure the future section of that version was mostly my thoughts on how it should go
2011-06-20T13:16:20  <antimatroid> McLeopold: do you have many thoughts on how we're going to reasonably reduce max turns?
2011-06-20T13:16:37  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes, and I put them in the new issue
2011-06-20T13:16:48  * antimatroid goes to the issues
2011-06-20T13:16:54  <janzert> actually maybe all I changed for that was saying seed should be based on last played
2011-06-20T13:17:20  <McLeopold> with multiplay and a random number of players, it makes sense
2011-06-20T13:17:24  <janzert> and that new submissions need to play with already established players
2011-06-20T13:17:37  <McLeopold> Plus, with the way things have been going on beta, I think it would be good
2011-06-20T13:17:52  <janzert> so from what I can tell I was always in favor of going with last time to play not last time as seed
2011-06-20T13:18:17  <McLeopold> The trueskill matching *should* take care of that, but I'm not sure if anyone has analyzed how good it's been doing
2011-06-20T13:18:23  <janzert> besides not being able to come up with a justification for the latter now ;)
2011-06-20T13:18:54  <McLeopold> match quality tends to favor established submissions
2011-06-20T13:19:01  <janzert> ok
2011-06-20T13:19:22  <McLeopold> I can create an sql statment to pull the quality of past matches to check our numbers
2011-06-20T13:19:51  <janzert> seeding is being done by user not submission right?
2011-06-20T13:19:57  * janzert goes to open the sql again
2011-06-20T13:20:31  <janzert> looks like
2011-06-20T13:21:09  <janzert> in which case the resubmission block should only be until the current submission finishes compiling
2011-06-20T13:21:19  <janzert> the 10 minute delay isn't needed anymor
2011-06-20T13:22:28  <McLeopold> why not?
2011-06-20T13:23:15  <janzert> the delay was put in because new submissions used to immediately get a game
2011-06-20T13:23:17  <McLeopold> I think it is still a good limitation for users, even if we don't need it for technical reasons.
2011-06-20T13:23:27  <janzert> so by constantly resubmitting a user could get constant games
2011-06-20T13:23:39  <janzert> that problem no longer exists
2011-06-20T13:24:03  *** Meatkat <Meatkat!~bovard@196.28.250.239> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-06-20T13:24:16  <McLeopold> but people love them some superstitions
2011-06-20T13:24:17  <janzert> and antimatroid was complaining earlier because he discovered a bug just after submitting but couldn't submit the fixed version because of the delay
2011-06-20T13:24:37  <antimatroid> i wasn't so much complaining as i said it was annoying :P
2011-06-20T13:24:40  <McLeopold> in that case, his old submission would still get games
2011-06-20T13:24:48  <janzert> although looking at the the code it seems like the current delay is 1 minute?
2011-06-20T13:25:00  <janzert> line 69 of submission.php
2011-06-20T13:25:01  <McLeopold> yeah, for beta :)
2011-06-20T13:25:14  <McLeopold> 60 seconds still got to antimatroid?
2011-06-20T13:25:23  <antimatroid> it's 10 minutes?
2011-06-20T13:25:24  <janzert> hmm, well anyone should be able to live with a minute delay :P
2011-06-20T13:25:34  <antimatroid> it certainly took longer than a minute
2011-06-20T13:25:49  <McLeopold> it's a good anti-spam measure anyway
2011-06-20T13:26:09  <janzert> yeah, a 1 minute delay seems more like an anti-spam measure
2011-06-20T13:26:17  <janzert> antimatroid: had it not finished compiling maybe?
2011-06-20T13:26:29  <antimatroid> janzert: probably it
2011-06-20T13:26:43  <McLeopold> oh, compiling on beta means waiting for the current game to finish
2011-06-20T13:26:45  <janzert> you can't resubmit until the current compilation finishes
2011-06-20T13:26:53  <janzert> ahh, yeah
2011-06-20T13:27:28  <janzert> another possibility is that the worker was down for a while this morning
2011-06-20T13:27:31  <McLeopold> perhaps a delete submission feature?
2011-06-20T13:28:08  <janzert> actually the worker was down just now
2011-06-20T13:28:23  <janzert> had experience a "no route to host" error
2011-06-20T13:28:39  <McLeopold> it would be cool if we gave each user a git repository and made them push changes, then compiling would happen from there
2011-06-20T13:28:48  <janzert> beta server network connection has been flaky the past few days
2011-06-20T13:29:03  <McLeopold> me ssh session seems fine
2011-06-20T13:29:33  <janzert> McLeopold: it was 3 hours ago or so
2011-06-20T13:29:39  <janzert> that the error happened
2011-06-20T13:29:55  <janzert> actually just over 2.5
2011-06-20T13:30:32  <janzert> also any idea what may have changed on the beta server that is causing all sorts of timeouts if we try and run the worker there?
2011-06-20T13:31:04  <McLeopold> not sure, can I try?
2011-06-20T13:31:08  <janzert> go ahead
2011-06-20T13:31:55  <janzert> it seems to have started around the time we switched battle method, but I tried switching it back and it was still timing out almost every bot in a game
2011-06-20T13:32:01  <McLeopold> looks like api_get_tasks is not returning
2011-06-20T13:32:24  <janzert> it must be eventually at least
2011-06-20T13:32:30  <janzert> the ec2 worker is getting tasks
2011-06-20T13:32:35  <McLeopold> it took entirely too long
2011-06-20T13:32:47  <antimatroid> hehe ^ "it took entirely too long"
2011-06-20T13:32:52  <janzert> but the timeouts I meant were players in games
2011-06-20T13:33:06  <janzert> almost every game was ending with all but one of the bots having timed out
2011-06-20T13:33:26  <janzert> I did notice mysql seems to be using more CPU than I remembered
2011-06-20T13:33:46  <McLeopold> I just ran a game with no timeouts...
2011-06-20T13:33:52  * antimatroid doesn't like the ghost thing
2011-06-20T13:33:59  <janzert> great
2011-06-20T13:34:00  <antimatroid> it's gone once you go above it? and just taunts you otherwise
2011-06-20T13:34:07  <janzert> maybe it resolved itself
2011-06-20T13:34:29  <McLeopold> oh wait...2 timeouts
2011-06-20T13:34:42  <antimatroid> could be java
2011-06-20T13:36:03  <McLeopold> I'm upping loadtime to 10 seconds just to see what happens
2011-06-20T13:36:29  <antimatroid> i've found a use for my start up time :)
2011-06-20T13:36:34  <janzert> I don't think it was always turn 0 although it seems the majority were
2011-06-20T13:37:17  <janzert> want me to stop the ec2 worker temporarily
2011-06-20T13:37:24  <McLeopold> nah
2011-06-20T13:37:33  <McLeopold> 1 java vm crash, 1 timeout
2011-06-20T13:38:00  <janzert> 28716?
2011-06-20T13:40:35  <McLeopold> I think we could only really know something is up depending on the bot
2011-06-20T13:40:47  <McLeopold> For instance, starter bots shouldn't timeout
2011-06-20T13:40:50  <janzert> 28716 is 2 timeouts btw
2011-06-20T13:41:32  <janzert> 28717 is ec2 worker
2011-06-20T13:42:06  <antimatroid> hunterbot timed out the other day from memory?
2011-06-20T13:42:14  <antimatroid> something normal timed out
2011-06-20T13:43:17  <antimatroid> amstan: whatever happened to adding some of those images to the site? they were pretty sweet

2011-06-20T13:43:50  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: what's up?
2011-06-20T13:44:05  <antimatroid> computerwiz_222: I'm not sold on the shading around "Google AI Challenge" and I think i
2011-06-20T13:44:24  <antimatroid> d  prefer the "sign in|sign up" stuff on the right hand side part at the top of the list
2011-06-20T13:45:07  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: the idea to have it on the left is to place emphasis on it
2011-06-20T13:45:33  <CIA-48> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * re827660 / (sql/0_schema.sql sql/2_generate_matchup.sql website/sql.php): added matchup timestamps - http://bit.ly/iMf9cZ
2011-06-20T13:45:38  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: the shading... i like it - i think it's a personal preference thing. you are free to try it without, just change the css
2011-06-20T13:45:44  <janzert> 29719 is from main server worker and has 2 timeouts one of them being csharp_starter
2011-06-20T13:45:54  <janzert> err, 28719 that is
2011-06-20T13:46:04  <antimatroid> personally i think an emphasized link in any intro parts is good, but slightly annoying if always in your face :P
2011-06-20T13:46:09  <antimatroid> not sure what anyone else thinks?
2011-06-20T13:46:29  <computerwiz_222> yeah, i just followed what most large sites do
2011-06-20T13:46:30  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I agree
2011-06-20T13:46:58  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: take facebook: they present every non-logged in user with an entire form to sign up
2011-06-20T13:47:23  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: maybe we could make it conditional - once you are logged in, it moves into the navbar on the right
2011-06-20T13:47:29  <antimatroid> computerwiz_222: did you just use facebook as an example for design? :P
2011-06-20T13:47:39  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: oh no, but it seems fitting
2011-06-20T13:47:44  <computerwiz_222> gmail does this too
2011-06-20T13:47:55  <computerwiz_222> if you're not signed in, it is easy to locate the register button
2011-06-20T13:48:46  <antimatroid> what if "Sign Up" was in bold on the right?
2011-06-20T13:48:52  <antimatroid> still more clearly outlined
2011-06-20T13:48:54  <antimatroid> but looks cleaner
2011-06-20T13:49:15  <computerwiz_222> we can try it - the decision to put it there was to fill that space
2011-06-20T13:49:28  <antimatroid> :)
2011-06-20T13:49:28  <McLeopold> janzert: 34,997 errored matchups.  That might be why get_task was taking so long...
2011-06-20T13:49:30  <mcstar> computerwiz_222: hi, can i make a suggestion to? its bugging me for some time
2011-06-20T13:49:39  <janzert> McLeopold: heh, ouch
2011-06-20T13:49:40  <computerwiz_222> my suggestion is to have it say sign up if you aren't signed in, and then once you login your username (and profile link are in the navbar)
2011-06-20T13:50:07  <antimatroid> amstan: for images, if we could splash them on the left and right down the specs page, that'd look good
2011-06-20T13:50:11  <antimatroid> not really sure otherwise
2011-06-20T13:50:12  <janzert> McLeopold: how does a matchup get flagged as errored? or at least where should I look to see that
2011-06-20T13:50:25  <antimatroid> maybe add one to the background image where the brown is? but not sure that'd look rihgt
2011-06-20T13:50:28  <amstan> antimatroid: janzert, McLeopold and computerwiz_222 don't seem to like them
2011-06-20T13:50:36  <McLeopold> I deleted them, otherwize the matchup table has the info
2011-06-20T13:51:18  <antimatroid> mcstar: it's bugging me that I don't know your suggestion yet, spit it out!
2011-06-20T13:51:29  <mcstar> computerwiz_222: i think that green theme is really bad, it doesnt go with the rust colored sides/background, and its hard on my eyes
2011-06-20T13:51:44  <mcstar> antimatroid: sorry, i was waiting on the confirmation of computerwiz_222
2011-06-20T13:52:02  <mcstar> i dont want to tire him with silly requests
2011-06-20T13:52:09  <McLeopold> mcstar: objection overruled :p
2011-06-20T13:52:43  <McLeopold> hmm, another stderr spewing bot...
2011-06-20T13:52:44  <amstan> mcstar: we had about 4 designers who claimed they would make a new design, the only one that went through with it was computerwiz_222
2011-06-20T13:52:49  <janzert> McLeopold: I mean what code is actually making the change to flag a matchup as errored or why?
2011-06-20T13:52:51  <amstan> mcstar: it's either this design, or the old one
2011-06-20T13:53:04  <computerwiz_222> yeah.. everyone likes to jump on the designers lol
2011-06-20T13:53:16  <computerwiz_222> like.. i want it YELLOW!
2011-06-20T13:53:21  <antimatroid> computerwiz_222: <3 sorry if it seems like hate, we're just good at pointing out what bugs us
2011-06-20T13:53:22  <McLeopold> janzert: api_game_result, if the engine detects it crashed without finishing the game
2011-06-20T13:53:27  <antimatroid> overall I do think it looks good
2011-06-20T13:53:28  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: yeah yeah i understand
2011-06-20T13:53:30  <janzert> ahh, ok
2011-06-20T13:53:32  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: i'm being a baby :P
2011-06-20T13:53:44  <amstan> webdesigns by cometee usually end bad: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell
2011-06-20T13:53:48  <McLeopold> I committed a mistake and let the server run overnight :(
2011-06-20T13:53:49  <mcstar> one interesting thing: chromium breaks ranking to two lines for me
2011-06-20T13:53:55  <mcstar> firefox shows it on one line
2011-06-20T13:54:18  <computerwiz_222> amstan: yes, that is exactly what happns
2011-06-20T13:54:21  <janzert> ah, so hopefully it's resolved
2011-06-20T13:54:28  <mcstar> but what is really interesing: if i zoom out in chromium, the break remains, but if i zoom in, it will stay in one line
2011-06-20T13:54:46  <McLeopold> computerwiz_222: can you add a live feed if things my cat tweets on the internet?
2011-06-20T13:55:02  <computerwiz_222> McLeopold: huh??
2011-06-20T13:55:05  <antimatroid> of*
2011-06-20T13:55:14  <amstan> McLeopold: lol
2011-06-20T13:55:21  <amstan> mcstar: and by zoom you mean ctrl+ ?
2011-06-20T13:55:21  <computerwiz_222> lol
2011-06-20T13:55:27  <amstan> mcstar: works fine for me
2011-06-20T13:55:29  <mcstar> ctrl scroll
2011-06-20T13:55:43  <computerwiz_222> all I can say is that I'm sorry you don't like it -- if you can get a few other people and a formal vote is called we can change it no problem
2011-06-20T13:55:49  <amstan> mcstar: i can't reproduce it
2011-06-20T13:55:53  <computerwiz_222> it is very hard to fulfill everyone's desires
2011-06-20T13:55:56  <amstan> mcstar: rankings.php right?
2011-06-20T13:56:03  <mcstar> yes
2011-06-20T13:56:12  <computerwiz_222> if i change it to blue then everyone will complain that they don't like green lol

2011-06-20T13:57:35  <mcstar> latest

2011-06-20T13:58:48  <mcstar> one explanation can be that my font sizes might not be the default, but nevertheless, i would expect it to not break the lines
2011-06-20T13:59:04  <amstan> mcstar: i have s/91/100/g
2011-06-20T13:59:08  <amstan> mcstar: works fine for me
2011-06-20T13:59:37  <mcstar> that small change must not matter
2011-06-20T13:59:59  <mcstar> i have 14pt default fonts
2011-06-20T14:00:33  <amstan> mcstar: does the ubuntu font load properly?
2011-06-20T14:00:39  <mcstar> yes
2011-06-20T14:00:44  <amstan> nvm, that wouldn't matter
2011-06-20T14:00:44  <McLeopold> mcstar: I can put a nowrap css style in
2011-06-20T14:00:47  <amstan> it's only for the headers
2011-06-20T14:01:07  <mcstar> no, the whole page is in ubuntu isnt it?
2011-06-20T14:01:10  <mcstar> lok closely
2011-06-20T14:01:13  <mcstar> look
2011-06-20T14:01:20  <mcstar> McLeopold: that would be good i think
2011-06-20T14:01:32  <janzert> McLeopold: every game from worker 3 seems to be having multiple timeouts

2011-06-20T14:01:55  <janzert> I don't think FlagCapper has been timing out at all
2011-06-20T14:02:11  <computerwiz_222> amstan: windows 99 :D
2011-06-20T14:02:17  <mcstar> my default browser fonst are the dejavu sans lgc family
2011-06-20T14:02:34  <mcstar> but for me the whole page is in ubuntu
2011-06-20T14:02:37  <computerwiz_222> mcstar: i'm installing google chrome right now
2011-06-20T14:02:44  <McLeopold> janzert: okay, not sure what the issues is, other than to say it's the server somehow
2011-06-20T14:03:23  <amstan> mcstar: oh.. right.. the whole page is ubuntu
2011-06-20T14:03:25  <janzert> ok, I wonder if it's related to the network issues it's been having too
2011-06-20T14:03:29  <mcstar> :D
2011-06-20T14:03:48  <mcstar> now you must pay licence
2011-06-20T14:03:54  <amstan> mcstar: it's free
2011-06-20T14:04:00  <McLeopold> janzert: if it is a vm, maybe the vm itself is getting starved?
2011-06-20T14:04:11  * mcstar always jokes when he is not serious
2011-06-20T14:04:14  <computerwiz_222> mcstar: that font is free
2011-06-20T14:04:17  <janzert> certainly a possiblity
2011-06-20T14:04:30  <computerwiz_222> it's like Myriad Pro but for the open source community :P
2011-06-20T14:04:51  <amstan> computerwiz_222: do you have to wear a turtle neck while designing with myriad pro?
2011-06-20T14:05:06  <mcstar> computerwiz_222: do you know about freetype2-infinality?
2011-06-20T14:05:21  <computerwiz_222> amstan: always, i wear two!
2011-06-20T14:05:32  <computerwiz_222> mcstar: no, never heard of it
2011-06-20T14:05:54  <mcstar> well, for the moment for linux its like the best font renderer
2011-06-20T14:06:17  <mcstar> i just installed it a couple of days ago, and my gtk fonts look beautiful
2011-06-20T14:06:26  <mcstar> as nice as qt fonts
2011-06-20T14:06:38  <computerwiz_222> i just installed google chrome to find out that the bug you suggest is not reproduceable :P
2011-06-20T14:06:39  <mcstar> (of course i mean fonts in appőlications)

2011-06-20T14:11:18  <amstan> even though it has less buttons than firefox
2011-06-20T14:11:22  <mcstar> :)
2011-06-20T14:11:42  <computerwiz_222> i'm not anti-chrome, i just need more reasons to use it (but i'm not asking, please refrain)
2011-06-20T14:11:53  <computerwiz_222> also..

2011-06-20T14:14:30  <amstan> mcstar: looks like 16
2011-06-20T14:14:35  <mcstar> thx
2011-06-20T14:14:56  <computerwiz_222> and then if it's FILO, we can pop OS X and then windows shortly after and then the program crashes because windows was there and linux rules them all

2011-06-20T14:16:52  <computerwiz_222> mcstar: i probably wouldn't handle a business payrole on linux because there is no one around to update the tax rates and so on

2011-06-20T14:18:52  <Rabidus> ok, back to the ants
2011-06-20T14:19:11  <mcstar> vi vs emacs? anyone?
2011-06-20T14:19:14  <mcstar> m
2011-06-20T14:19:19  <Rabidus> nano!
2011-06-20T14:19:20  <computerwiz_222> vi
2011-06-20T14:19:21  <computerwiz_222> yay
2011-06-20T14:19:31  <mcstar> well, i use them both :D
2011-06-20T14:19:35  <Rabidus> notepad vs wordpad? anyone?
2011-06-20T14:19:37  <Rabidus> :D
2011-06-20T14:19:40  <computerwiz_222> but i use nano for most config files for some reason
2011-06-20T14:19:45  <mcstar> Rabidus: that is just silly
2011-06-20T14:19:46  <computerwiz_222> force of habit
2011-06-20T14:19:49  <Rabidus> yes. :D
2011-06-20T14:20:04  <mcstar> bash vs tcsh?
2011-06-20T14:20:10  <computerwiz_222> bash
2011-06-20T14:20:12  <computerwiz_222> lol
2011-06-20T14:20:20  <computerwiz_222> i will form an opinion on most things :P
2011-06-20T14:20:36  <mcstar> i said it earlier, i realized today that theres not going to be any bot written in bash :(
2011-06-20T14:20:51  <amstan> mcstar: why not?
2011-06-20T14:20:55  <amstan> mcstar: we can do bash just fine
2011-06-20T14:21:00  <antimatroid> Rabidus: notepad++
2011-06-20T14:21:07  <mcstar> bash spawns processes by the tousands
2011-06-20T14:21:15  <mcstar> hehe
2011-06-20T14:21:23  <Rabidus> never used again after ftp plugin trashed somehow one of my files
2011-06-20T14:21:44  <mcstar> amstan: consider that even a simple $() spawns a new process
2011-06-20T14:22:11  <mcstar> and then comes any utility u use, sed/awk/bc/echo/cat
2011-06-20T14:22:13  <amstan> mcstar: is there really no other way?
2011-06-20T14:22:41  <amstan> can't you just use simple string concats?
2011-06-20T14:22:59  <mcstar> well, if we very very restrict ourselfes, it might work
2011-06-20T14:23:12  <mcstar> but i guess it would make the code awkward
2011-06-20T14:23:23  <mcstar> and bash's main idea is to interface commands
2011-06-20T14:23:52  <amstan> yes, but that's not allowed
2011-06-20T14:23:54  <amstan> muhahah
2011-06-20T14:24:13  <mcstar> oh, another flame: gnome/kde/awesome
2011-06-20T14:24:28  <mcstar> you guessed right, im using the last one
2011-06-20T14:24:59  <computerwiz_222> what is awesome?
2011-06-20T14:25:02  <computerwiz_222> lol
2011-06-20T14:25:28  <mcstar> one of the best tiling window managers
2011-06-20T14:25:39  <computerwiz_222> oh, it's tiling?
2011-06-20T14:25:40  <computerwiz_222> very ncie
2011-06-20T14:25:43  <amstan> mcstar: how does it compare to xmonad?
2011-06-20T14:25:49  <george1914> ok, since everyone seems to be trying to stir things up here, i am going to contribute by posing the question ...
2011-06-20T14:25:51  <Rabidus> what about ants?
2011-06-20T14:26:00  <amstan> Rabidus: what about ants?
2011-06-20T14:26:13  <george1914> what is the (estimated) timeline for the contest?
2011-06-20T14:26:15  <computerwiz_222> ants you say...
2011-06-20T14:26:15  <Rabidus> umm.. some talking about it :)
2011-06-20T14:26:27  <amstan> george1914: idk, we're having a meeting tonight to discuss that
2011-06-20T14:26:32  <computerwiz_222> amstan: what time?
2011-06-20T14:26:34  <mcstar> i was about to use xmonad, but it was quite a change to switch to tiling wms, and learning at the same time lisp and haskell seemed hard
2011-06-20T14:26:38  <amstan> computerwiz_222: see topic
2011-06-20T14:26:44  <McLeopold> george1914: when I fix stuff, which is taking awhile because I'm busy with life
2011-06-20T14:26:49  <mcstar> so i went with awesome + lua
2011-06-20T14:27:07  <amstan> ew, lua
2011-06-20T14:27:38  <mcstar> yeah, i know, i dont want to know it, but for writing a config file its pretty straightforward
2011-06-20T14:27:40  <McLeopold> I thought lua was cool?
2011-06-20T14:27:55  <computerwiz_222> lol
2011-06-20T14:27:56  <mcstar> you only have to mod. already existing ones
2011-06-20T14:28:32  <amstan> McLeopold: the only advantage it has over python is the sandboxing
2011-06-20T14:29:06  <McLeopold> whoa, Pontifical Catholic University...
2011-06-20T14:29:54  <computerwiz_222> McLeopold: what?
2011-06-20T14:30:06  <McLeopold> I'm reading the lua website
2011-06-20T14:30:23  <computerwiz_222> that sentence was hard to read, i read whoa in an all excited way but then calmed way down about the University... lol
2011-06-20T14:31:00  <mcstar> i didnt like lua, cause it comes from portugese, and it a usually warm country, i might eat their dishes, but i dont think i want to use their software
2011-06-20T14:31:10  <amstan> mcstar: lol
2011-06-20T14:31:33  <McLeopold> It comes from Brazil, not portugal
2011-06-20T14:31:58  <mcstar> well the name is prtugese
2011-06-20T14:32:09  <mcstar> means the moon
2011-06-20T14:32:12  <george1914> ok, thanks for that - i'll keep looking in.  very good of you folks to work on this ....     - if/when you have any guesses it'd be great to know - i saw dates somewhere like september, and also winter? - so i have no idea at all when things might begin officially - the anticipation/excitement might have killed me by winter you see ... .)
2011-06-20T14:32:23  <mcstar> but the same argument holds
2011-06-20T14:32:46  <amstan> george1914: yes, i was hoping we could have released earlier, but that didn't happen
2011-06-20T14:32:55  <mcstar> oh, im not racist, but i have stereotypes
2011-06-20T14:33:29  <McLeopold> If your stereotype is about a people group, then that means your rasist.
2011-06-20T14:33:58  <mcstar> what if i hate stupid people? am i racist?
2011-06-20T14:34:18  <McLeopold> I would say no, because any people group can contain stupid people.
2011-06-20T14:34:19  <amstan> McLeopold: how can you not have a stereotype about a group of people?
2011-06-20T14:34:24  <computerwiz_222> stupid people aren't a stereotype, that's a trait
2011-06-20T14:34:29  <McLeopold> amstan: very hard not to
2011-06-20T14:34:31  <computerwiz_222> being stupid isn't a stereotype*
2011-06-20T14:34:38  <computerwiz_222> god that sentence was rough
2011-06-20T14:34:45  <mcstar> :)
2011-06-20T14:34:49  <amstan> also.. why are we talking about grammar?
2011-06-20T14:35:01  <computerwiz_222> because i said so. don't poke the bear
2011-06-20T14:35:15  <mcstar> hell, grammar, have any of you heard of the Voynich manuscript?

2011-06-20T14:37:58  <mcstar> its a manuscript written in an unknown languge made probably in the 14th century
2011-06-20T14:38:17  <computerwiz_222> if the language is unknown, how do you know it's a language?
2011-06-20T14:38:25  <computerwiz_222> it could just be an interesting series of paintings :P
2011-06-20T14:38:28  <mcstar> good question
2011-06-20T14:38:41  <mcstar> from soe statistical methods, it resembles a language
2011-06-20T14:38:43  <mcstar> some
2011-06-20T14:38:48  <computerwiz_222> neat
2011-06-20T14:39:12  <mcstar> and there are some peculiar drawings in the book too, very interesting
2011-06-20T14:39:30  <McLeopold> You all need to do something constructive.  Free T-Shirt to the person who solves this. https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/191
2011-06-20T14:39:45  <amstan> McLeopold: what kind of tshirt?
2011-06-20T14:39:58  <McLeopold> amstan: you are supposed to be on my side!
2011-06-20T14:40:08  <mcstar> just put it in a mathematical theorem prover
2011-06-20T14:40:19  <amstan> McLeopold: i am, but i have to know how much enthusiasm to dedicate
2011-06-20T14:40:43  <McLeopold> amstan: you need to get the others to have enthusiasm, not yourself
2011-06-20T14:41:00  <amstan> ok everyone! free 3 wolf moon tshirt!
2011-06-20T14:41:08  <antimatroid> :D
2011-06-20T14:41:08  <McLeopold> It will have a hole for you head, your torso, and 2 holes for your arms
2011-06-20T14:41:38  <mcstar> what about my nipples?
2011-06-20T14:41:47  <McLeopold> no holes for nipples
2011-06-20T14:41:52  <antimatroid> whoever makes that 3 wolf moon tshirt must love that meme
2011-06-20T14:41:53  <amstan> McLeopold: what about the holes in between atoms?
2011-06-20T14:41:56  <mcstar> then no enthusiasm

2011-06-20T14:44:33  <Rabidus> then they are not original
2011-06-20T14:44:40  <McLeopold> We can discuss the mutilation of merchandise after the trueskill has been fixed.  I will be abliging

2011-06-20T14:45:20  <amstan> was it not agreeing with the microsoft online one?
2011-06-20T14:46:20  <McLeopold> yes, that was the issue
2011-06-20T14:46:26  <McLeopold> jskill was much more accurate

2011-06-20T14:59:02  <mcstar> :)
2011-06-20T14:59:18  <mcstar> i just changed the hue and contrast of the original
2011-06-20T15:01:35  <mcstar> you know, this game is full of colors, all the different players have diff. colors, i thought the site could use them as well
2011-06-20T15:01:40  <mcstar> and i like pastel colors
2011-06-20T15:01:58  <mcstar> they are nice in the terminal too
2011-06-20T15:02:19  <McLeopold> I'm being honest, and sorry if I offend, but it really does look really bad.
2011-06-20T15:02:41  <mcstar> i can uderstand that

2011-06-20T15:12:43  <McLeopold> I don't think I would have choosen the purple or pink

2011-06-20T15:34:11  <McLeopold> Yes, I think overall it may be more descriptive.  Maybe "Less occupied" is better.
2011-06-20T15:34:30  <McLeopold> Perhaps we need a really good description first, then we can come up with a name
2011-06-20T15:34:49  <janzert> yeah, except we need one word and 'occupied' seems better than 'less' ;)

2011-06-20T15:55:53  <janzert> ok, I'll go ahead and shut it down altogether and bring up  a fresh one later then
2011-06-20T16:02:20  <McLeopold> janzert: here's my attempt at an explaination https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-occupied-battle-resolution-method
2011-06-20T16:03:25  * janzert is working on a narrative explanation now
2011-06-20T16:03:45  <janzert> I'm down to 2 lone ants of opposing colors ;)
2011-06-20T16:04:09  <McLeopold> my link was a narrative
2011-06-20T16:04:37  <janzert> not in quite the same way mine is, I'll post what I've got so far in just a bit
2011-06-20T16:04:53  <McLeopold> okay, maybe together we can make it easy to understand
2011-06-20T16:05:16  <McLeopold> I'm okay if it takes a little for users to grok battle resolution.  That's where jeff disagrees.
2011-06-20T16:05:37  <janzert> especially when the simple cases are really straightforward
2011-06-20T16:05:45  <janzert> 1 against 1 kills both
2011-06-20T16:05:47  <McLeopold> I think seeing the game as a whole, people will think "Oh, you need to gather food and attack the enemy, cool"
2011-06-20T16:05:49  <janzert> 2 against 1 kills 1
2011-06-20T16:06:29  <McLeopold> Also, when they see a good bot not lose anything, then they will be inspired to learn the "battle tricks" which is always fun.
2011-06-20T16:07:59  <george1914> the github description confused me today.    'An ant lives if it has less enemies in range than each of those enemies have in range.'   - maybe replace the word 'each of' with  'every one of'?
2011-06-20T16:08:30  <McLeopold> george1914: try reading the link I just posted and tell me what you think
2011-06-20T16:08:36  <george1914> ok
2011-06-20T16:08:39  <george1914> reading
2011-06-20T16:10:24  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Occupied-battle-resolution-narrative
2011-06-20T16:10:37  <janzert> there is the start, it doesn't quite finish yet
2011-06-20T16:11:01  <janzert> and of course is a very rough first draft
2011-06-20T16:12:34  <george1914> McLeopold:   i understood it best by reading the code.   the description above was correct, but i would find it a little confusing if i didnt already know it.  maybe that is just me.
2011-06-20T16:12:43  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-20T16:12:50  <McLeopold> we are working to make it better
2011-06-20T16:13:23  <george1914> i would be thinking 'hang on, doesnt ant A die anyway?   (it does, but like you say, you dont choose to discuss that as well).
2011-06-20T16:13:51  <george1914> so i guess it is ok description, but not perhaps as unambiguous as it could be ....
2011-06-20T16:13:58  <janzert> george1914: any thoughts on the 'story' based approach?
2011-06-20T16:14:54  <janzert> which isn't meant to be the completely definitive explanation even when completed of course, but a way to give people an intuitive understanding
2011-06-20T16:15:41  <george1914> description seems fine and clear.  though does not cover all cases (yet)
2011-06-20T16:18:54  <sigh> janzert, first time reading all this... this line sounds scary "This process is of course quite complex", it is not immediatly obvious that it is complexity that the developer doen't need to worry about (that it is just a cute part of the story)
2011-06-20T16:20:06  <janzert> sight: "This action is of course quite complex, taking much fine and detailed work by the ant"
2011-06-20T16:20:08  <janzert> any better?
2011-06-20T16:20:44  <sigh> not sure, you'll need to ask someone with no background knowledge, but be aware of it
2011-06-20T16:21:20  <sigh> it's just that when I was reading it I wondered whether you had made the ant spawning more complex until I put things in context :)
2011-06-20T16:21:21  <janzert> the whole story is meant to be a rather light hearted treatment as if the ants were actual physical creatures
2011-06-20T16:21:44  <george1914> '(1) for every ant -j- that is fighting, count how many enemies it fights (ie within attackradius), call it e[j].    (2) now, every ant -j- kills every other ant -k- within its battleradius  IF  e[j] <= e[k]'

2011-06-20T16:22:47  <george1914> maybe :/
2011-06-20T16:27:15  <mcstar> an ant dies, if it has the highest number of enemy ants of all of its enemies in its battle radius, if its a tie, all of those ants die
2011-06-20T16:28:07  <sigh> janzert, the best suggestion I can make it is to use a different word than complex... I think delicate is a good choice since it is easily disrupted by enemy ants

2011-06-20T16:30:10  <janzert> I'm also hoping the ease with which reader ends up resolving that 'complex' will at least subconsciously relax them when they encounter the second 'complex' at the end of the paragraph. :)
2011-06-20T16:30:16  <mcstar> delete second is
2011-06-20T16:30:57  <sigh> janzert, yeah the second complex is actually something the programmer has to worry about :P

2011-06-20T17:13:25  <astevenson> maybe when Duke Nuke Forever comes out?  :)
2011-06-20T17:13:33  <george1914> it'll all be over by christmas
2011-06-20T17:13:34  <janzert> I really hope we're measuring time to start in less then months at this point :)
2011-06-20T17:13:46  <george1914> ah, sounds good   :)
2011-06-20T17:13:55  <astevenson> Ok sounds good, just curious..
2011-06-20T17:14:29  <janzert> I personally think the measure is still in weeks, but others might debate that we're closer
2011-06-20T17:15:24  <janzert> but that I think is about the best idea anyone has of start date still
2011-06-20T17:15:31  <george1914> the narrative looks ok also - needs to link to the 'rigorous' description also though i guess.    btw   maybe it is spelt   'peek'  in no peeking?
2011-06-20T17:15:55  <janzert> oops, yes
2011-06-20T17:16:13  <janzert> I'm not talking about summiting a mountain anyway
2011-06-20T17:16:30  <george1914> that is good to know - i can see why you dont want to have a fixed date - is nice to know very roughly when it is though, so thanks for that info  :)
2011-06-20T17:24:06  <sigh> I thought the start date was supposed to be back in April :P

2011-06-20T17:37:34  <carlop> for help understand the battle resolution method, i think the best way should start with "Calculate for each ant the number of enemy ant in his attack range (this is how much an ant is "occupied").", and then telling when an ant survive or nto
2011-06-20T17:37:40  <carlop> seem clearer to me
2011-06-20T17:39:38  <carlop> so maybe the line "the enemy is surronded by less (or the same) of its own enemies than the ant" can become "the enemy is less or equal occupied than the ant"
2011-06-20T17:41:52  <carlop> a part from this, I think that McLeopold description work

2011-06-20T18:12:08  <janzert> select * from game_player where game_id=<game id>; will give you everything stored about each player in the game for the game <game id>
2011-06-20T18:13:33  <janzert> just the game score and player id would be select player_id, game_score from game_player where game_id=1234;
2011-06-20T18:14:03  <janzert> you probably really want the user_id though
2011-06-20T18:14:56  <janzert> I assume player_id is the player number in the game?

2011-06-20T18:35:11  <stocha> i like the work occupied (though maybe i use the french similar word).   I picture it as "busy"
2011-06-20T18:35:22  <stocha> So a ant is as busy as there is ennemy in sight.
2011-06-20T18:35:35  <McLeopold> stocha: yeah, that's the idea
2011-06-20T18:35:44  <McLeopold> Zaphus: can you open an issue on the next game idea
2011-06-20T18:35:53  <stocha> reverse would be attentive. so busy can be distracted also.
2011-06-20T18:36:07  <McLeopold> RPleonasm: what's the bot name?
2011-06-20T18:36:07  <stocha> So the most attentive ant, will kill any more distracted ants.
2011-06-20T18:36:17  <McLeopold> stocha: exactly
2011-06-20T18:36:19  <stocha> (it focus on distracted ant and tore it to pieces)
2011-06-20T18:36:30  <stocha> oh it was all already settled ?
2011-06-20T18:37:29  <McLeopold> RPleonasm: you got caught on the bad server, upload again and it will be fine
2011-06-20T18:37:43  <RPleonasm> oh ok, thanks :)
2011-06-20T18:38:15  <stocha> maybe only one term should be used. So let's go for distracted maybe.
2011-06-20T18:38:50  <stocha> Every ennemy ant an ant can see distract it. The less distracted ant will kill any more distracted ennemy in sight.
2011-06-20T18:38:59  <McLeopold> maybe focus?
2011-06-20T18:39:16  <McLeopold> If an ant is more focused than an enemy, it will kill it
2011-06-20T18:39:31  <stocha> i'd rather have it distracted.
2011-06-20T18:39:42  <stocha> then it's direct proportionnale to the ennemy count.
2011-06-20T18:40:02  <McLeopold> that's why I stated it both ways in the wiki
2011-06-20T18:40:05  <stocha> my goal was to have only one term.
2011-06-20T18:40:32  <janzert> stocha: too late for that we already got two, you can only add more now :}
2011-06-20T18:40:49  <stocha> mm, i'll use distracted in my own head then :p
2011-06-20T18:41:03  <stocha> at least someone will profit from my hard reflections :p
2011-06-20T18:41:19  <stocha> doesn't really change the math does it.
2011-06-20T18:42:08  <janzert> that's probably the real problem with this method is that the math came first and we're trying to find good natural language ways of stating

2011-06-20T18:43:53  <stocha> i don't really like the term occupied. For me it reffers to "occupied territory" :p
2011-06-20T18:44:09  <stocha> i'd rather have it "busy" or something more standard for business than occupied.
2011-06-20T18:44:25  <McLeopold> stocha, you may be right
2011-06-20T18:44:39  <McLeopold> distracted/busy/focus are all better terms
2011-06-20T18:45:07  <stocha> let's update that word then.
2011-06-20T18:45:14  <janzert> to throw another one out there, I found myself using 'attention' a lot when writing the narrative
2011-06-20T18:45:37  <janzert> I like distracted as well
2011-06-20T18:45:39  <stocha> occupied as well as attention are from french origins :p
2011-06-20T18:45:56  <stocha> you wouldn't want to use french words would you.
2011-06-20T18:45:58  <mcstar> janzert: just thought about devided attention :)
2011-06-20T18:46:24  <mcstar> e->i
2011-06-20T18:46:34  <mcstar> no
2011-06-20T18:46:47  <stocha> the thing is, the more the word is close to core english (the most used english words) the better.
2011-06-20T18:46:58  <mcstar> yes
2011-06-20T18:47:04  <stocha> usually word from french origine are farther appart from the core.
2011-06-20T18:47:15  <stocha> they are more refined or something :p
2011-06-20T18:47:40  <stocha> although my knowledge of english being limited, i can't say for sure.
2011-06-20T18:47:43  <stocha> i have to go.

2011-06-20T18:48:08  <Zaphus> McLeopold:  that search is very close to what I want, only difference is that I would change it to class a 'win' against another player as finishing higher than them on a game (e.g. 2 beats 3)

2011-06-20T20:11:02  <_flag> The fact that there are only four directions is also a bit of a problem because I can't go towards an enemy and stay alongside it if it's running in a certain direction at the same time

2011-06-20T21:03:24  <Zaphus> that new seeding method looks like it is working fantastically, every bot I have looked at is getting a similar rate of games (I've looked at about 20)

2011-06-20T21:04:37  <j3camero> What sorts of servers do we want for the workers?

2011-06-20T21:09:27  <j3camero> It was getting only a few dozen pageviews per day anyways.
2011-06-20T21:09:32  <j3camero> I think.
2011-06-20T21:09:54  <amstan> people were using the forums for some deving
2011-06-20T21:10:04  <j3camero> Oh haha make that 250 ish per day.
2011-06-20T21:10:39  <j3camero> What's it mean in the rankings when someone's name appears in a lighter font?
2011-06-20T21:11:02  <amstan> they were there before, but they submitted another bot and they're doing worse now
2011-06-20T21:11:17  <j3camero> Oh I see.
2011-06-20T21:11:26  <Zaphus> its good to have, but very annoying when there are lots, should be optional
2011-06-20T21:11:39  <amstan> we can probably tweak it
2011-06-20T21:11:51  <j3camero> My thought is to disable it by default, as cool as it is. Or at least explain it. It's really confusing.
2011-06-20T21:12:10  <Zaphus> or...  if you are logged in then show your ghost by default but not the others ?
2011-06-20T21:12:22  <j3camero> That would be good yeah.
2011-06-20T21:12:36  <j3camero> Or even not. It would be so much clearer to display a user's peak rank on their profile.
2011-06-20T21:12:43  <j3camero> Along with the time when that rank was last achieved.
2011-06-20T21:12:46  <j3camero> Something like that.
2011-06-20T21:13:09  <jbroman> j3camero: Wouldn't that be misleading: people who submit early would naturally have a very good peak rank.
2011-06-20T21:13:17  <j3camero> That's okay.
2011-06-20T21:13:20  <Zaphus> go the whole hog, add a rating or rank graph over time ?
2011-06-20T21:13:29  <j3camero> Yeah why not.
2011-06-20T21:13:59  <j3camero> Having ghosts in the rankings is pretty confusing. We could explain it, but most people would not read the explanation and be confused anyways.
2011-06-20T21:14:19  <j3camero> If your new bot sucks more (or other people have improved their bots around you) then your ranking should go down.

2011-06-20T21:20:09  <j3camero> Though I feel many IRC regulars are probably better qualified for that by now.
2011-06-20T21:20:22  <antimatroid-uni> i like spawn2 = 1, attack2 = 5 and view2 = 55
2011-06-20T21:20:54  <antimatroid-uni> j3camero: we've gone back to the more confusing battle option (quite recently)
2011-06-20T21:21:05  <j3camero> Okay.
2011-06-20T21:21:05  <antimatroid-uni> we discovered that the damage option allowed blocking far too easily
2011-06-20T21:21:23  <antimatroid-uni> and in general seemed to favour the "defender" much more in such situations
2011-06-20T21:21:39  <j3camero> What do we do if someone discovers a degerate or semi-degenerate tactic with the latest battle logic?
2011-06-20T21:21:58  <antimatroid-uni> we can make maps more open depending on how much that helps
2011-06-20T21:22:02  <j3camero> As long as we have a backup ready to go in the engine then I'm cool.
2011-06-20T21:22:07  <antimatroid-uni> otherwise we're always going to have that doubt to some degree
2011-06-20T21:22:17  <antimatroid-uni> there are other options in the engine worst comes to worst
2011-06-20T21:22:27  <j3camero> Sounds good to me.
2011-06-20T21:22:47  * janzert is here now; checking archives
2011-06-20T21:22:48  <antimatroid-uni> does anyone have any complaints with scoring?
2011-06-20T21:23:12  <j3camero> Hey janzert. I was gonna light up some EC2 instances now. Which ones should we get?
2011-06-20T21:23:46  <Zaphus> @amstan:  FYI this issue: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/174  is also related to the ghosts/high water
2011-06-20T21:23:47  <contestbot> Zaphus: User error -- Replace user.
2011-06-20T21:23:52  <Zaphus> amstan:  FYI this issue: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/174  is also related to the ghosts/high water
2011-06-20T21:26:20  <antimatroid-uni> janzert: what are your thoughts on max turns?
2011-06-20T21:26:21  <janzert> per McLeopold the ghosts are only meant to hang around for a bit while the new submissions rank stabilizes, they hang around forever now to help him during beta
2011-06-20T21:26:28  <antimatroid-uni> i think we should reduce it quite a bit for the moment
2011-06-20T21:26:45  <janzert> oh I guess McLeopold showed up before I did anyway :)
2011-06-20T21:27:23  <j3camero> janzert what sort of EC2 instances do we want?
2011-06-20T21:27:37  <janzert> j3camero: for what, workers?
2011-06-20T21:27:57  <janzert> don't just fire a bunch up though
2011-06-20T21:27:59  <j3camero> Yep
2011-06-20T21:28:05  <j3camero> Okay
2011-06-20T21:28:27  <janzert> m2.xlarge for workers is what I've been using
2011-06-20T21:28:31  <j3camero> I was thinking of starting 2 workers tonight.
2011-06-20T21:28:49  <janzert> but you need the right ami and user data before requesting them
2011-06-20T21:30:22  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@nat/google/x-ltniljmiqkcxuadt> has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
2011-06-20T21:30:42  <janzert> antimatroid-uni: I've been working on downloading game data today so I can actually build that histogram to see what length games have been taking
2011-06-20T21:33:07  <antimatroid-uni> i think we can afford to cut it down further than that might imply
2011-06-20T21:33:29  <antimatroid-uni> look at any of my bots games, it isn't smart with battles at all but reasonably aggressive at chasing after enemies
2011-06-20T21:33:40  <antimatroid-uni> when it wins it doesn't usually take even 500 turns
2011-06-20T21:33:40  <janzert> but at least it will give us an idea what is happening now
2011-06-20T21:33:49  <janzert> yep
2011-06-20T21:33:51  <antimatroid-uni> yep
2011-06-20T21:34:07  <antimatroid-uni> i think we all agree it's okay to make people work for the food bonus
2011-06-20T21:34:14  <janzert> it seems many reasonably good playing bots finish in under 500
2011-06-20T21:34:19  <antimatroid-uni> although it might open the door up for farming again?
2011-06-20T21:35:01  <antimatroid-uni> if there's a high chance of missing out on the bonus, let them stay just above the level where the game would be called off, i'm thinking about ending the game early, but yeah that^^
2011-06-20T21:38:14  <janzert> I'm also still enamored with making a per-map dynamic turn limit ;)
2011-06-20T21:38:38  <antimatroid-uni> it affects the food bonus amount
2011-06-20T21:38:42  <antimatroid-uni> but so does the spawn rate etc.

2011-06-20T21:43:33  <j3camero> Will start those up now.
2011-06-20T21:43:34  <janzert> :)
2011-06-20T21:43:49  <amstan> decent, decent
2011-06-20T21:45:12  <antimatroid-uni> there should be a "previous next" page link section below the leaderboard
2011-06-20T21:47:58  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott.Bri@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-20T21:53:46  <j3camero> What are we doing about a web server?
2011-06-20T21:54:36  <j3camero> janzert: are the workers more stable this time? Do they have to be rebooted often?
2011-06-20T21:54:45  <janzert> they seem to be much more stable
2011-06-20T21:54:50  <j3camero> It's fine if they do, I am just wondering what percentage of uptime we get from each one.
2011-06-20T21:54:52  <McLeopold> For game length, I'd rather not turn it down just yet.
2011-06-20T21:55:09  <McLeopold> I'm going to put in some logic to cut games off and we can see how it does on beta.
2011-06-20T21:55:18  <janzert> I've seen our own script crash out a few times for bugs that I've then fixed :/
2011-06-20T21:55:32  <janzert> but not seen the OS actually lock up so we should be pretty good
2011-06-20T21:55:39  <McLeopold> That means we could turn game length up very high and it only goes long when it needs to.
2011-06-20T21:55:45  <amstan> McLeopold: i would like to get away from the beta server, we have like 2 days left till we're charged for 2 months
2011-06-20T21:56:02  <j3camero> Sounds good McLeopold. Game length is touchy, since it's something that everyone sees. Games cut short can confused people and make them perceive the contest as not fair or broken. Just things to keep in mind.
2011-06-20T21:56:28  <janzert> I went trawling through WHT forum for good dedicated server providers and came up with one the other night, but of course now I can't remember the name :P
2011-06-20T21:56:32  <McLeopold> The official discussion is here. https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/193
2011-06-20T21:56:34  <j3camero> Sounds good janzert. OS locking up is an issue that has plagued both Tron and Galcon contests.
2011-06-20T21:56:35  <janzert> let me see if I can dig it back up again
2011-06-20T21:57:07  <McLeopold> The goal is to make sure everyone agrees that the games that were cut off are the ones that should have been.  I think we will find a good metric.
2011-06-20T21:57:07  <janzert> ahh, yes singlehop.com
2011-06-20T21:57:17  <janzert> anyone have first hand experience with them?
2011-06-20T21:57:40  <Zaphus> I like the "overpowering" idea - if someone dominates the game for a significant length of time, end it.   Seems fair on everyone, and unlikely to ever change the final result
2011-06-20T21:58:06  <j3camero> Nope no experience.
2011-06-20T21:58:11  <j3camero> What do you like singlehop?
2011-06-20T21:58:22  <McLeopold> There are 2 types of games that need to be cut off, 1) all stupid bots that can't fight, 2) 1 dominate bot that won't end the game
2011-06-20T21:58:25  <amstan> they do have ppl smiling
2011-06-20T21:58:40  <j3camero> My experience with our last host was pretty good. Nothing to complain about. Us having a shitty server was my fault.
2011-06-20T21:58:41  <janzert> people seemed to say good things about them on WHT forum and the look like a good price
2011-06-20T21:58:53  <j3camero> Nice nice.
2011-06-20T21:59:00  <janzert> WHT is webhostingtalk.com btw
2011-06-20T21:59:15  <j3camero> Maybe I will snag one of those and direct the ai-contest.com domain at it.
2011-06-20T21:59:21  <McLeopold> amstan: can we still have some type of beta server going?
2011-06-20T21:59:29  <janzert> lot of providers seem to hang out there
2011-06-20T21:59:39  <j3camero> For now let's stick with amstan's beta server with a weird URL to avoid a false start.
2011-06-20T21:59:39  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, we'll setup a new beta on the new servers
2011-06-20T21:59:49  <amstan> oh?
2011-06-20T21:59:53  <janzert> McLeopold: the official server can simply be in beta for a while
2011-06-20T22:00:16  <McLeopold> Which means I'm allowed to touch it and break things?
2011-06-20T22:00:25  <amstan> well, the beta server that we got now is from demerzel
2011-06-20T22:00:53  <amstan> McLeopold: is there any objections to making you an admin? you did say you don't want to compeete
2011-06-20T22:01:03  <janzert> hmm, that's right once we move to whatever will be the official main server we'll need to lock out everone that doesn't want to give up participation privileges
2011-06-20T22:01:09  <McLeopold> On the ghost issue.  I plan to make it on by default, and allow users to turn it off if they want.
2011-06-20T22:01:48  <janzert> McLeopold: can they disappear once the new submissions sigma is below a certain value?
2011-06-20T22:01:57  <janzert> that really makes the most sense to me
2011-06-20T22:02:27  <j3camero> I think it's a good idea to have two web servers running (even if they're on the same physical box). One "staging area" at staging.ai-contest.com and then the main one at ai-contest.com. That way we can deploy to the staging area first without worrying about breaking stuff.
2011-06-20T22:03:04  <amstan> j3camero: i'm thinking about an archive server, we could put the staging on the same one
2011-06-20T22:03:06  <McLeopold> yes, I like that idea
2011-06-20T22:03:28  *** slkjcna_ <slkjcna_!~proton@li189-81.members.linode.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-20T22:03:32  <janzert> j3camero: if it's the same machine I think we still need to lock out any non-organizers
2011-06-20T22:03:54  *** _flag_ <_flag_!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-20T22:04:02  <j3camero> Yeah these things can all go on one physical box. The staging area plus the archive would get a few hundred pageviews per day or something easy like that.
2011-06-20T22:04:12  <j3camero> janzert: why?
2011-06-20T22:04:27  <amstan> j3camero: the testing people should have root
2011-06-20T22:04:41  <amstan> so.. it would make it hard to lock them out if they're on the same comp
2011-06-20T22:04:44  <janzert> because they could gain access to the submissions of the contest
2011-06-20T22:05:04  <j3camero> I think we are not talking about the same thing.
2011-06-20T22:05:06  <janzert> and in any case it would be viewed as suspicious I believe
2011-06-20T22:05:58  <j3camero> I am talking about another instance of apache and another instance of mysql that is just a mirror of the main server. Except that we deploy there first before deploying to the main instance. It's just so we can catch breakages before deploying for real.
2011-06-20T22:06:10  <McLeopold> okay, gtg, do a @later if you need me to do something
2011-06-20T22:06:38  <amstan> j3camero: we won't be able to catch much with just a mirror website
2011-06-20T22:06:44  <antimatroid-uni> yeah i'm off to the shop
2011-06-20T22:06:50  <antimatroid-uni> i'll be back in a bit if you need anything from me
2011-06-20T22:06:58  <janzert> maybe not, I mean that only people that give up participation should have access to the machine that hosts the website/database or workers for the main contest
2011-06-20T22:07:08  <Zaphus> j3camero: so it would not be running matches itself ?  just using a copy of the SQL DB ?
2011-06-20T22:07:27  <j3camero> yes janzert agreed. Only admins can have shell access to the machines.
2011-06-20T22:07:59  <j3camero> Zaphus: I am thinking something like the current beta server.
2011-06-20T22:08:23  <janzert> ok, which means a staging area on the same machine won't be accessible to McLeopold, mleise and such
2011-06-20T22:08:40  <Zaphus> j3camero:  but people with access to the current Beta have access to the bot submissions, right ?  - and if you want people to upload bots to test the staging they need to be protected
2011-06-20T22:08:43  <amstan> j3camero: what i'm thinking about is a totally separated host that could be used for most developers in testing

2011-06-20T22:18:41  <j3camero> It's true.
2011-06-20T22:19:03  <j3camero> I know these two huge prime numbers. They're so obscure you've probably never heard of them before.

2011-06-20T22:22:55  <amstan> _flag_: yes, good question
2011-06-20T22:23:09  <amstan> i would say 2 weeks
2011-06-20T22:23:36  * amstan has said that many times, but it never happened, i hope it will this time
2011-06-20T22:23:36  <Zaphus> here's a game where 2000 turns wasnt quite enough for one player... he would have won if there were a few more turns (I would have won if I wasnt so stupid).   300:50 ants on a small map and I run away :-)   http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28997&user=78
2011-06-20T22:24:00  <j3camero> Cool.

2011-06-20T22:27:49  <janzert> j3camero: so at an average price of $0.175 per hour per worker how many workers can we afford?
