2011-08-15T12:22:29  <janzert> poulter7: no timeline, just when all the blocking bugs are fixed. Unfortunately progress has been stalled the last few weeks with the developers not having time to work on it.
2011-08-15T12:33:14  <mleise> :'(:'(:'(
2011-08-15T12:36:31  <janzert> at least I just checked off one of those blocking bugs ;)
2011-08-15T12:37:31  <mleise> like, you worked on a blocker?
2011-08-15T12:37:49  <mleise> or like "it wasn't valid any more" *g*
2011-08-15T12:38:30  <janzert> the former :)
2011-08-15T12:38:37  <janzert> and finished it
2011-08-15T12:38:53  <mleise> very nice, what was it? some sql?
2011-08-15T12:39:23  <janzert> yeah, sql query for the duplicate email check was invalid

2011-08-15T13:50:44  <poulter7> Hey janzert , I notice in the tools that you mention running play_one_game.sh have I missed that? :P doesn't seem to be in the zip at http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip
2011-08-15T13:53:05  <janzert> I haven't really been involved in the tools packaging and such, but I seem to recall that the tools.zip is meant for windows and as such doesn't include the .sh scripts and the .tgz(?) version has the unixy .sh scripts in it
2011-08-15T13:55:12  <poulter7> Did you have a link for this tool.tgz? Its not at http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.tgz
2011-08-15T13:55:36  <amstan> @tools
2011-08-15T13:55:37  <contestbot> amstan: tools could be Windows: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip | Linux/MacOS X: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.tar.bz2.
2011-08-15T13:57:22  <poulter7> Wonderful. Thanks I'm not sure that's discussed on the website.
