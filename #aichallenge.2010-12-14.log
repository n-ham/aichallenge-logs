2010-12-14T01:48:18  <delt0r___> antimatroid: Trust me, as someone who has coded agnet systems and has a RTS getting done. Avoiding Collisons is hard, esp for beginers... all the "ants" need to be 100% coordinated. Which most won't do at least to start with...
2010-12-14T01:48:30  <delt0r___> thats the problem with "an move i don't want... die"
2010-12-14T01:48:59  <delt0r___> it sets the bar high for a starter bot (no--a fancy starter pack is not a substitute. )
2010-12-14T01:50:07  <Frontier> delt0r: how about giving the bot with the lower id the advantage to move to a square that two or more bots want to move to?
2010-12-14T01:51:03  <Frontier> all you need is a list the size of your ant count with the move targets of other ants
2010-12-14T01:51:34  <antimatroid> Frontier: i don't like that
2010-12-14T01:52:13  <antimatroid> delt0r____: i really don't like having ants not end up where you expect them too, if i don't do that my two options are kill both, friends fight, or fusion
2010-12-14T01:52:23  <antimatroid> i don't really mind out of those options
2010-12-14T01:52:43  <antimatroid> yes, that's three
2010-12-14T01:53:17  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.93.92> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-14T01:59:44  <antimatroid> delt0r: i'm pretty sure my specification will work as intended with the following order of move processing
2010-12-14T01:59:44  <antimatroid> 1. Attacks
2010-12-14T01:59:45  <antimatroid> 2. Harvests
2010-12-14T01:59:45  <antimatroid> 3. Deposits (deposits to home don't land on an ant first)
2010-12-14T01:59:45  <antimatroid> 4. Moves
2010-12-14T01:59:45  <antimatroid> 5. Spawning of ants
2010-12-14T01:59:45  <antimatroid> 6. Kill/Fuse (kill/fuse friend ants that land on the same square)
2010-12-14T01:59:46  <antimatroid> 7. Collision fights (fight opponent ants that are on the same square)
2010-12-14T01:59:46  <antimatroid> 8. Check win/draw/lose conditions
2010-12-14T02:03:43  <Frontier> antimatroid: I wasn't talking about the server. It may just kill the ants, fine. I was talking about the starter package. So that these ants give the 'oldest' ants, with the lowest id the advantage to move to a square both try to move to
2010-12-14T02:04:36  <antimatroid> Frontier: my plan with the starter packages is to make moves for each ant incrementally, never move friends into the same square
2010-12-14T02:04:51  <delt0r___> antimatroid: If you give ants gloabal coords, then its trival to detect "not ending up where you asked to go"
2010-12-14T02:05:06  <delt0r___> its a very very common problem in AI and machine leraning
2010-12-14T02:05:16  <delt0r___> did my command "effector" work?
2010-12-14T02:05:44  <antimatroid> delt0r___: with collision undos, you make make all valid moves, which all get stopped from them blocking one of yours
2010-12-14T02:05:47  <antimatroid> i don't like that either :P
2010-12-14T02:06:04  <delt0r___> ??
2010-12-14T02:06:08  <Frontier> how can you go WITHOUT global coordinates in a game where one program controls all ants?
2010-12-14T02:06:13  <antimatroid> sorry, that made no sense
2010-12-14T02:06:35  <antimatroid> it's possible that all moves i made were valid until they landed where i did, undoing every move i made
2010-12-14T02:06:40  <delt0r___> well lets see your code... I think you will find the dynamics of "fuse" odd, and perhaps not very intuitive...
2010-12-14T02:07:08  <delt0r___> What... that still makes no Sense
2010-12-14T02:07:48  <antimatroid> consider your bots as a snake, with a blank square between the head and an enemy ant, your snake may all try to shuffle forward, but they might move towards you too, then no ant moves at all
2010-12-14T02:07:55  <delt0r___> Fussy effectors and Fussy sensors is the bread and butter of real "ai"
2010-12-14T02:07:56  <antimatroid> bots== ants
2010-12-14T02:08:09  <delt0r___> they are not a snake
2010-12-14T02:08:17  <antimatroid> no, it's an example
2010-12-14T02:08:51  <delt0r___> yea--why you have a safe "following" distance..
2010-12-14T02:08:56  <delt0r___> thats the how point
2010-12-14T02:09:13  <delt0r___> where if i stack... just stack em all
2010-12-14T02:09:30  <antimatroid> fusing ants is a terrible idea
2010-12-14T02:09:41  <delt0r___> or in your case one dies each turn till you have no ants
2010-12-14T02:09:44  <antimatroid> you can't spread out vision, can't carry as many grains etc.
2010-12-14T02:09:52  <antimatroid> it's just something to handle people making stupid moves
2010-12-14T02:10:11  <delt0r___> well get it going and lets see how it works
2010-12-14T02:10:25  <delt0r___> I don't think it will however
2010-12-14T02:10:26  <antimatroid> yeah, i will get onto the engine later
2010-12-14T02:10:30  <antimatroid> i need to go out for dinner soon though

2010-12-14T07:43:25  <antimatroid> bah i hate java
2010-12-14T07:43:34  <antimatroid> my computer can't find "javac" command
2010-12-14T07:43:35  <delt0r> java is awesomeness
2010-12-14T07:43:48  <delt0r> your on windows arn't you
2010-12-14T07:43:49  <antimatroid> even after installing jde and adding the bin path to path
2010-12-14T07:43:51  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-12-14T07:44:00  <delt0r> well thats not java;s fault
2010-12-14T07:44:11  <antimatroid> i blame java :P
2010-12-14T07:44:39  <delt0r> C/C++ doesn't work too well if your os can't find the compiler either
2010-12-14T07:47:07  <antimatroid> yes, but mine can :P
2010-12-14T07:47:38  <antimatroid> (i know my hate of java is entirely irrational, this is just me exagerating the irrationalness :))
2010-12-14T07:47:48  <antimatroid> so... why would my computer not find it? any ideas?
2010-12-14T07:48:13  <antimatroid> i restarted and everything
2010-12-14T07:51:12  <delt0r> I havn't used windows for many years..
2010-12-14T07:51:20  <delt0r> it will be a path thing
2010-12-14T07:51:34  <delt0r> but i don't know about paths in windows... since like DOS
2010-12-14T07:52:51  <delt0r> anyway, I thought you were just doing everything i c++
2010-12-14T07:52:55  <delt0r> in
2010-12-14T07:53:33  <antimatroid> i have no idea how to feed input to different process etc. to do an engine properly
2010-12-14T07:53:43  <antimatroid> so i need to hack my version into yours :P
2010-12-14T07:54:08  <aerique> delt0r: your rts idea sounds nice, you might as well make a seperate post on the forums for it
2010-12-14T07:54:30  <delt0r> you like it?
2010-12-14T07:54:59  <delt0r> Its really the same sematics as your squad idea... just "passable terrain"
2010-12-14T07:56:03  <delt0r> I may make a another engine/bot this weekend --and include  a human bot...
2010-12-14T07:56:13  <delt0r> Perhaps tcp...
2010-12-14T07:56:41  <delt0r> And get a proper engine --i keep writing a lot of bolier plate code. (ie IO code)
2010-12-14T07:58:20  <antimatroid> tcp would be good
2010-12-14T07:58:33  <antimatroid> so people can easily watch games without downloading anything
2010-12-14T07:58:37  <delt0r> adding that is easy after you have decent IO code
2010-12-14T07:59:10  <delt0r> well now you mean a tcp server and site
2010-12-14T07:59:21  <aerique> i might try to get an engine and visualizer up for my idea in the coming weeks.. not sure, currently working on projects that got delayed due to planet wars :)
2010-12-14T07:59:35  <delt0r> lol
2010-12-14T08:00:24  <delt0r> aerique, I don't think we would need both to be implemented... since i think "squad combat" is close enough to what i was thinking (and would like)
2010-12-14T08:00:39  <delt0r> but hay --the more the merrier
2010-12-14T08:00:45  <delt0r> its xmass after all
2010-12-14T08:00:55  <antimatroid> if we set up a training ground with past contests
2010-12-14T08:01:06  <antimatroid> we can add some of these games if they get made well enough
2010-12-14T08:04:26  <aerique> delt0r: go ahead then, i'm not sure i would get to it
2010-12-14T08:05:03  <delt0r> k, so it would be another sunday thing... But i would be more motivated to write better code

2010-12-14T09:08:06  <antimatroid> i have your files open and i'm looking through them
2010-12-14T09:09:18  <delt0r> I start with init... then start process with whatever C++ does for that (don't remeber) with the default streams as needed
2010-12-14T09:09:49  <delt0r> ie you end up with 2 input streams and 2 output streams from both process
2010-12-14T09:10:26  <delt0r> for each turn I first write out the current "state" with blocking IO to each output stream for each bot/process
2010-12-14T09:10:26  <antimatroid> okay, i'll start exploring
2010-12-14T09:10:27  <antimatroid> thanks
2010-12-14T09:11:11  <delt0r> then I go into a loop using non blocking IO to read from each process/bots input stream
2010-12-14T09:11:31  <delt0r> with a sleep in the loop.. so i don't consume all there cpu cycles.
2010-12-14T09:12:05  <delt0r> I stop reading once i get a go or a timeout happens...
2010-12-14T09:12:12  <antimatroid> yep, i'm going to try feeding each bot the state incrementally, then worry about pausing the inactive process later
2010-12-14T09:12:18  <delt0r> update game state... rinse and repeat
2010-12-14T09:12:53  <delt0r> Its easier and better just to send each bot everything at once. Its also probably faster
2010-12-14T09:13:19  <delt0r> but thats down in the ms range
2010-12-14T09:13:32  <antimatroid> yeah, and you don't get the same amount of time each turn then
2010-12-14T09:13:36  <antimatroid> depending on how much time they use
2010-12-14T09:13:40  <delt0r> ??
2010-12-14T09:14:01  <antimatroid> atm, each bot was running on the same core and given the same 1 second to make their move
2010-12-14T09:14:10  <delt0r> yes
2010-12-14T09:14:13  <antimatroid> so if both bots used all their time, they really only got 0.5 seconds
2010-12-14T09:14:18  <antimatroid> i don't like that at all
2010-12-14T09:14:21  <delt0r> multitasking OS --for real men
2010-12-14T09:14:35  <delt0r> its defined as wall time in the rules
2010-12-14T09:14:43  <antimatroid> it's not hard to just feed each ant the state incrementally and give them the same time per turn
2010-12-14T09:14:46  <delt0r> run on a dual core otherwise
2010-12-14T09:14:47  <antimatroid> we can halve comp time

2010-12-14T09:15:06  <delt0r> incrementally ? what
2010-12-14T09:15:12  <delt0r> if the bots don't have a go
2010-12-14T09:15:21  <delt0r> they are "waiting" for more data
2010-12-14T09:15:23  <antimatroid> pass state to bot 1, get moves, pass state to bot 2, get moves, resolve
2010-12-14T09:15:44  <delt0r> But whats stoping bot 1 from using non blocking IO
2010-12-14T09:15:49  <antimatroid> eventually, hopefully we can KILL the inactive process so it doesn't do anything during the other bots turn
2010-12-14T09:15:53  <delt0r> and runing before you send more state data?
2010-12-14T09:16:03  <delt0r> not kill
2010-12-14T09:16:05  <delt0r> STOP
2010-12-14T09:16:08  <delt0r> START
2010-12-14T09:16:13  <antimatroid> yeah that :P
2010-12-14T09:16:18  <antimatroid> bocsi said KILL :P
2010-12-14T09:16:20  <delt0r> I don't think its worth it
2010-12-14T09:16:21  <antimatroid> seemed strange to me
2010-12-14T09:16:32  <antimatroid> it makes it more consistent
2010-12-14T09:16:49  <antimatroid> how your bot plays against a quick bot is the same as how it will play against a slow bot
2010-12-14T09:16:57  <delt0r> only if the stop/start are going to behave the way you expect
2010-12-14T09:17:03  <delt0r> which it probably won't
2010-12-14T09:17:17  <delt0r> Its a pretty heavy weight OS call
2010-12-14T09:17:29  <antimatroid> hmmm...
2010-12-14T09:17:46  <antimatroid> i think it's ideal, but maybe not if there is too much overhead
2010-12-14T09:18:15  <delt0r> certianly not really going to be "fairer" than just running them at the same time and letting the OS do the task switching and schedulling
2010-12-14T09:18:45  <delt0r> And very very OS dependent
2010-12-14T09:18:52  <antimatroid> are we allowed to legally use the time the engine uses to compute stuff?
2010-12-14T09:19:02  <delt0r> in the last comp
2010-12-14T09:19:04  <delt0r> yes
2010-12-14T09:19:10  <amstan_> antimatroid: you are, but... don't rely on you
2010-12-14T09:19:13  <amstan_> it*
2010-12-14T09:19:26  <delt0r> but the "engine" is so fast its not really worth it
2010-12-14T09:19:32  <amstan_> we might get a better paralleling engine/server
2010-12-14T09:19:36  <antimatroid> amstan_: i don't, just fleshing out what is/isn't possible
2010-12-14T09:19:37  <delt0r> non blocking IO is tedious
2010-12-14T09:19:38  <amstan_> so you might not have the time
2010-12-14T09:19:47  <amstan_> delt0r: +1
2010-12-14T09:20:38  <delt0r> amstan_, Do you have any preference for the next game? what kind of game? etc
2010-12-14T09:21:07  <amstan_> no
2010-12-14T09:21:21  <amstan_> i'm mostly interested in having a very good backend
2010-12-14T09:21:29  <antimatroid> that's easy
2010-12-14T09:21:31  <amstan_> the game will be awesome either way
2010-12-14T09:21:31  <delt0r> yea--I bet
2010-12-14T09:21:34  <amstan_> antimatroid: not really
2010-12-14T09:21:39  <antimatroid> the problem is picking the most interesting game
2010-12-14T09:21:41  <amstan_> antimatroid: we tried it for 3 contests now
2010-12-14T09:21:52  <amstan_> we're still using a bunch of php scripts
2010-12-14T09:21:59  <antimatroid> for the website?
2010-12-14T09:22:00  <delt0r> backend is where you end up with the work... when its not working i guess
2010-12-14T09:22:15  <antimatroid> i was thinking engine as backend :P
2010-12-14T09:22:43  <antimatroid> (realises the stupidity of my comment after just asking htf engine is formed)
2010-12-14T09:22:44  <delt0r> amstan_, is much work getting done on the backend?
2010-12-14T09:24:33  <amstan_> delt0r: none right now
2010-12-14T09:24:42  <amstan_> delt0r: we'll start at the beggining of jan
2010-12-14T09:25:04  <amstan_> antimatroid: engine is mostly easy
2010-12-14T09:25:11  <amstan_> antimatroid: i'm thinking everything besides the game
2010-12-14T09:27:17  <antimatroid> i think i'd be more of a nuisance than help with that stuff

2010-12-14T19:16:33  <delt0r_> ie you doing the "how do i move the tank"
2010-12-14T19:16:44  <delt0r_> aka robotics
2010-12-14T19:17:41  <delt0r_> So having a complete "physics" model for the tank..then each bot end up being mainly code to address the "physics" not the problem per say
2010-12-14T19:18:03  <delt0r_> and the real problem with that is the things like PID controlers would work really well

2010-12-14T19:21:26  <Frontier> I found the bug in Opera. It was the RAM cache setting. If it is set to anything different than 'auto' it will cause trouble in the drawImage function of a html canvas
2010-12-14T19:26:21  <Cyndre_> delt0r_: could simplify the tank tracks and just have it move like a tron tank
2010-12-14T19:32:58  <Frontier> If it is a new game idea, I already don't like it because of the explicit modern war theme. Ants are cool. Did you know they have additional eyes on the forehead?

2010-12-14T21:39:12  <Frontier> It should also be possible to paste a map generator or bot code in JavaScript.
2010-12-14T21:39:33  <antimatroid> one* square per line
2010-12-14T21:39:46  <sigh> I think it would be smaller and more user friendly if the map was serialised as a 2d char array
2010-12-14T21:40:25  <sigh> followed by a list of ants with coord,player,hp
2010-12-14T21:40:54  <Frontier> sigh, antimatroid: Have you seen the replay format in PlanetWars? Something like that would be nice. First it creates the start situation, then it only stores the fleets.
2010-12-14T21:41:34  <Frontier> sigh: I agree with that. There is lots of empty space otherwise.
2010-12-14T21:42:17  <Frontier> In other words separate static and dynamic content
2010-12-14T21:42:30  <antimatroid> the other option is to do S x y, then any lines following that (A, W, G) give information?
2010-12-14T21:42:41  <antimatroid> so you don't give uneeeded info?
2010-12-14T21:43:21  <Frontier> antimatroid: The difference is between a) the communication between ant and server and b) how the visualizer plays back a replay.
2010-12-14T21:44:44  <antimatroid> Frontier: what if i give you the char map and then pass you any new information?
2010-12-14T21:44:45  <Frontier> I'm only interested in b) so far :D
2010-12-14T21:45:15  <antimatroid> i can represent the start on a char map except for starting grains at home
2010-12-14T21:45:55  <Frontier> sounds good
2010-12-14T21:46:58  <antimatroid> i'm considering removing maxharvest
2010-12-14T21:47:05  <antimatroid> so ants can carry as many grains as they like

2010-12-14T21:48:56  <Frontier> what's up with my typing today?
2010-12-14T21:49:04  <antimatroid> Frontier: because when an ant kills another ant now or has grains deposited, some might need to be dropped as well

2010-12-14T21:49:57  <antimatroid> it just simplifies things if ants can carry as much as they want, you still want to set up supply lines i think

2010-12-14T21:51:52  <Frontier> pgpaskar_: The charecters get decoded correctly. There is exactly one ? for every multi-byte character. There are just no Greek letters to fill that space in the font.

2010-12-14T21:52:31  <pgpaskar_> in between its just gibberish

2010-12-14T21:56:30  <antimatroid> there should never be new information other than for ants and grain levels
2010-12-14T21:57:14  <Frontier> maxHarvest would be the maximum in the base, right?
2010-12-14T21:57:26  <antimatroid> no, maximum harvest an ant can carry
2010-12-14T21:57:40  <antimatroid> the home base (and any other square) can have as many grains as necessary, but none start with more than 5
2010-12-14T21:57:48  <Frontier> kk
2010-12-14T21:58:03  <antimatroid> you probably don't need maxharvest info or view radius
2010-12-14T21:58:37  <Frontier> i'll take it anyway. it might be useful.
2010-12-14T21:58:55  <antimatroid> i'm pretty close to throwing out max harvest though
2010-12-14T21:59:12  <antimatroid> i don't think it makes the game much more interesting for the amount of effort
2010-12-14T21:59:30  <Frontier> I think I wouldn't need the startGrains, if the bases were seperate lines. Then the startGrains would just be the grains on the two base fields

2010-12-14T22:15:05  <Frontier> Ok, it's good to have one line per turn as well
2010-12-14T22:16:02  <sigh> yup
2010-12-14T22:16:43  <Frontier> ok, now how do i identify the ants and know which ant moved where?
2010-12-14T22:17:10  <antimatroid> Frontier: how about this proposal? http://codepad.org/HJQiZh3R
2010-12-14T22:17:12  <sigh> that's why antimatroid said "oh wait, this format wont work with animated ant movement"
2010-12-14T22:17:18  <antimatroid> that way we can see ants walk onto walls and then die etc.
2010-12-14T22:17:47  <antimatroid> i'll send you information that the ant that moved onto the wall is now non-existent
2010-12-14T22:17:49  <sigh> i'd rather give the ants ids
2010-12-14T22:18:10  <antimatroid> sigh: i can add that now?
2010-12-14T22:18:29  <sigh> you can add anything you want?
2010-12-14T22:18:34  <sigh> what are you asking?
2010-12-14T22:18:40  <antimatroid> should i :P
2010-12-14T22:18:54  <antimatroid> bah, this just got messy, Frontier: ignore that link :)
2010-12-14T22:19:00  <sigh> well, if you want to track ants that's the best way
2010-12-14T22:19:17  <amstan> dudes.. use json for this
2010-12-14T22:19:20  <amstan> stop worrying about format
2010-12-14T22:19:30  <amstan> there's a very high chance we'll do so in the official contest
2010-12-14T22:19:36  <antimatroid> we need format to get something running :P
2010-12-14T22:19:42  <amstan> yes, use json
2010-12-14T22:19:51  <amstan> stop creating new formats
2010-12-14T22:19:55  <antimatroid> it
2010-12-14T22:19:56  <Frontier> amstan: we need format to know what information we need
2010-12-14T22:20:01  <antimatroid> s just an output format, so easy to change
2010-12-14T22:20:27  * Frontier looks on the internet what this JSON hype is all about
2010-12-14T22:20:30  <amstan> antimatroid: change it sooner than later
2010-12-14T22:20:38  <sigh> amstan: what I was discussing was orthogonal to using json vs anything else
2010-12-14T22:20:58  <antimatroid> Frontier: do you prefer to receive newX newY or direction for ant movements?
2010-12-14T22:22:56  <Frontier> let me think about that. I guess it depends on what turn we start with. In a 3 turn game there are the states for 0-1-2-3.
2010-12-14T22:24:02  <Frontier> So when I go to the first turn and replay it... yes I would need the new coordinates.
2010-12-14T22:24:40  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/Xe8WTZPi
2010-12-14T22:24:42  <Frontier> and if the distance is greater than 1,5 i know someone hax0red
2010-12-14T22:26:12  <Frontier> if you want to you can merge newx and newy into the other ant line.
2010-12-14T22:26:20  <sigh> what's the point in old coords if you have the ant id?
2010-12-14T22:26:52  <Frontier> sigh: you are right, these ids came out of nowhere
2010-12-14T22:27:36  <sigh> well, I just suggested them as an alternative to giving two sets of coords for every move *shrug*
2010-12-14T22:27:39  <Frontier> wait... can an ant move and die after the move?
2010-12-14T22:27:58  <Frontier> so i can't just look at the next turn to see where it moved to?
2010-12-14T22:28:28  <antimatroid> Frontier: yes
2010-12-14T22:28:38  <antimatroid> that's why i'm passing mvoes, then passing ant info
2010-12-14T22:28:54  <Frontier> oh yeah and let's use JSON. It is bloated like xml, but it's not my server bandwidth! :)
2010-12-14T22:29:16  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-gcugegzsrtouoemk> has quit IRC (Quit: bhasker)
2010-12-14T22:29:22  <antimatroid> i don't see why json is needed
2010-12-14T22:29:32  <antimatroid> handling input works fine now, and is easy as
2010-12-14T22:29:36  <antimatroid> it couldn't be any easier
2010-12-14T22:29:37  <Frontier> to add fields later on
2010-12-14T22:30:05  <sigh> json is bloated? o_O
2010-12-14T22:31:10  <Frontier> antimatroid: i don't need the moves first and then the ant info. (?) I get the information at turn start, right?
2010-12-14T22:31:38  <Frontier> sigh: If I see that right, JSON requires you to declare the type of object on each object.
2010-12-14T22:31:47  <sigh> Frontier: no
2010-12-14T22:32:16  <sigh> Frontier: json is structured exactly how you would declare the data structure in javascript
2010-12-14T22:34:22  <Frontier> if i send 40 ants, how often do i have to declare that an ant has a field named "harvest" ?
2010-12-14T22:36:22  <Frontier> antimaroid: another benefit is that it automagically turns into in-memory data when you call "eval(JSON-string)".
2010-12-14T22:36:26  <sigh> depends on how you represent it.... if each ant is a hash then yes, you'll have something like this for each ant: {"hp": 3, "x":2, "y":4, "harvest": 6}
2010-12-14T22:36:29  *** HeelToe <HeelToe!~eric@72.188.15.66> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-14T22:37:11  <HeelToe> quick question, I've made a bot that I think works this time, where can I play people?
2010-12-14T22:37:13  <sigh> if you are that worried about space there is nothing stopping you from representing each ant a a list of values [3,2,3,6] :P
2010-12-14T22:37:30  <HeelToe> planet wars that is
2010-12-14T22:37:52  <Frontier> sigh: That's a good point :)
2010-12-14T22:37:59  <Frontier> @tcp
2010-12-14T22:38:00  <contestbot> Frontier: tcp = (#1) http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/, or (#2) http://72.44.46.68/, or (#3) 98.247.248.39:995 (zeroviz.us), or (#4) http://tcp.zeroviz.us/, or (#5) http://tcp2.zeroviz.us/ (crazy!)
2010-12-14T22:38:19  <Frontier> HeelToe: look for players on these servers
2010-12-14T22:38:38  <sigh> HeelToe: the competition has finished... not sure that there are many people on the tcp servers
2010-12-14T22:38:50  <Frontier> or download other participant's source codes and try locally.
2010-12-14T22:38:58  <sigh> that's the best bet
2010-12-14T22:39:30  <HeelToe> ok, the only place I can get code is if they posted it on the forums correct?
2010-12-14T22:39:30  <Frontier> even the winner has released his code. You need a lisp compiler for it
2010-12-14T22:39:41  <antimatroid> Frontier: I think I might actually output moves to you before even handling the other moves in the engine
2010-12-14T22:40:13  <antimatroid> that way you see your ant walk onto a wall before dying etc.
2010-12-14T22:40:50  <antimatroid> i might need to pass you "K" antID as a move too if we do antIDs
2010-12-14T22:41:00  <antimatroid> for kill ant
2010-12-14T22:42:00  <antimatroid> i want to change the word move to something like walk
2010-12-14T22:42:10  <HeelToe> ty guys
2010-12-14T22:42:16  *** HeelToe <HeelToe!~eric@72.188.15.66> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2010-12-14T22:42:25  <sigh> scurry
2010-12-14T22:42:36  <antimatroid> scurry from here to there? :P
2010-12-14T22:42:40  <antimatroid> i think walk is right
2010-12-14T22:43:48  <Frontier> amstan: We were talking about the replay format, just in case you thought it was the server<->bot communication.
2010-12-14T22:44:09  <amstan> it would help if that was json as well
2010-12-14T22:44:49  <antimatroid> how is adding more info to what's passed through json any different to changing the info passed through input/output?
2010-12-14T22:44:51  <Frontier> alright, if it is done correctly that would mean a lot of structuring code.
2010-12-14T22:44:56  <antimatroid> you still have to make bots handle the information passed
2010-12-14T22:45:23  <Frontier> It could be some several KB larger than a game right now
2010-12-14T22:46:33  <Frontier> It's your decision if "it would help" >= additional bandwith :p
2010-12-14T22:47:07  <antimatroid> i don't see why, if we change what json passes, how is that easier than changing what gets passed now?
2010-12-14T22:47:32  <amstan> you're only replacing commas with spaces and adding a few quotes here and there
2010-12-14T22:49:35  <antimatroid> all i have to do if input changes now is create an extra variable and add an extra >> myVariable;
2010-12-14T22:49:41  <antimatroid> i don't see how that could get any easier
2010-12-14T22:49:44  <Frontier> amstan: you also add the field names in every object, correct? ant : { x: 1, y: 2, hp: 5; player: 1; harvest: 12 }
2010-12-14T22:50:47  <amstan> Frontier: you're right i guess
2010-12-14T22:50:49  <amstan> nvm
2010-12-14T22:51:27  <amstan> why is there a player 1 property though?
2010-12-14T22:51:38  <amstan> there should be a player 1 array with all the ants of player1s
2010-12-14T22:52:06  <Frontier> ok that can be done, we were still working it out
2010-12-14T22:53:26  <Frontier> I wont just go ahead now and implement it either way (JSON or plain text) without your approval. Do you still want the replays in JSON?
2010-12-14T22:53:34  <antimatroid> how can you pass an ant? don't you need to create an object for all files called ant then? which means my bot then has 2 ant objects?
2010-12-14T22:54:02  <sigh> files?
2010-12-14T22:54:16  <antimatroid> well if you pass an object that you made, all files need to know wtf that is yeah?
2010-12-14T22:54:25  <antimatroid> so they also need to define ant exactly like that
2010-12-14T22:54:39  <antimatroid> but then if i want ants represented my own way, then my bot will have 2 different versions of ant
2010-12-14T22:55:03  <amstan> Frontier: if you are confident the ant will always have those fields you could convert it to an array
2010-12-14T22:55:10  <amstan> and not use named fields
2010-12-14T22:55:27  <antimatroid> amstan: wasn't the point that you might change things? :P
2010-12-14T22:56:16  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, but if there's a ton of ants you might want to optimize
2010-12-14T22:56:35  <sigh> I propose the JSON following format to sidestep all these issues: {"data":"....."}
2010-12-14T22:56:53  <sigh> I learnt it from all the XML experts
2010-12-14T22:57:01  <amstan> sigh: lol
2010-12-14T22:58:54  <Frontier> *sigh*
2010-12-14T23:00:05  <antimatroid> sigh: worst
2010-12-14T23:00:10  <antimatroid> :P
2010-12-14T23:00:13  <sigh> :(
2010-12-14T23:00:18  <Frontier> in xml you would define default values for "hp" and "harvest" :p ...
2010-12-14T23:00:25  <antimatroid> I'm being stubborn, :P
2010-12-14T23:00:36  *** HeelToe <HeelToe!~eric@66.15.188.72.cfl.res.rr.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-14T23:00:57  <antimatroid> i don't see how anything is easier than
2010-12-14T23:00:58  <antimatroid> gameStream >> moveType
2010-12-14T23:00:58  <antimatroid> case(moveType)
2010-12-14T23:00:58  <antimatroid> etc.
2010-12-14T23:01:08  <amstan> oh yeah.. is harvest usually 0?
2010-12-14T23:01:16  <amstan> if so.. then you can only include it when you actually need it
2010-12-14T23:01:25  <amstan> prepend the stuff with the default value
2010-12-14T23:02:01  <Frontier> and i check for "is defined" in the javascript then... well that could work
2010-12-14T23:02:27  <HeelToe> (planet wars) everyone else's code times out on my machine :( I don't think I'm setting it up right...
2010-12-14T23:02:29  <HeelToe> so i found the server, now how do I run my bot on it on port 995? (planet wars)  *sorry for the noob questions

2010-12-14T23:03:19  <antimatroid> download that
2010-12-14T23:03:24  <antimatroid> and yes port 995
2010-12-14T23:13:41  <Frontier> I plan to interpolate the ant movement and turn them smoothly along the way. It could also be nice to see the remains of an ant and maybe ant paths where they are used frequently.
2010-12-14T23:14:16  <HeelToe> i can get the map to show up on the combat tab, playing two of my bots against each other, but it displays "turn 1/0"

2010-12-14T23:25:56  <HeelToe> do I need a username and password on the TCP host?
