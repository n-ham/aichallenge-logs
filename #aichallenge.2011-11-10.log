2011-11-10T00:11:00  <userjjb> I think I figured out a way to reduce the storage necessary for the shortest path from any point to any other point on a 200x200 map from 3.2Gb to ~100Kb
2011-11-10T00:11:27  <userjjb> much smaller than 100Kb depending on the map
2011-11-10T00:12:45  <userjjb> and reduce the number of searchable nodes in a pathfinding algorithm from 40000 to ~200
2011-11-10T00:13:27  <userjjb> for long distance paths, and for shorter distance no pathfinding is even necessary

2011-11-10T01:05:42  <userjjb> bqf: the only pathfinding you need to do/save is between regions, and generally the number of regions goes up as square root of map size, potentially much slower depending onhow "open" the map is

2011-11-10T01:11:21  <LouisMartin> userjjb: yea, me neither. Some may have implemented this idea yet, it still will stay an "out-of-the-box" idea I'd think.  A*Star, BFS, Minimax = 95% of all decent bot in the contest at the moment.

2011-11-10T01:11:47  <userjjb> My understanding of graph theory is that a lot of the "pathfinding" algorithms are for a generic graph, whereas the type of graph that represents a grid with only NESW movement is relatively special, it's certainly "sparse" it's only 1/10000 connected as much as a fully dense graph, so I figured there should certainly be some specialized pathfinding algorithms possible
2011-11-10T01:13:04  <LouisMartin> Janzert: is there any way to tell the engine to not stop the game whatever happens?   or as long as there's some enemy hills?
2011-11-10T01:13:25  <userjjb> datachomper: Well the idea I have in my head is treating each region as it's own "cell" and applying a conventional pathfinding algo on it

2011-11-10T03:32:24  <antimatroid> we don't really need all passages to be 3 wide, but would prefer a 3x3 block to be able to traverse the map (except maybe the edges of walls)

2011-11-10T03:34:27  <pairofdice> Also why would an antwall of 4 wide be any less impenetrable than 2 wide?

2011-11-10T03:36:15  <pairofdice> It allows for mutual destruction

2011-11-10T03:40:16  <janzert> pairofdice: it's easy to test, make a bot that just always moves north and a bot that does nothing. Then create a map with a column of ants n wide in the middle and a block of ants at least n+2 wide at the top
2011-11-10T03:40:35  <janzert> for n < 3 you should find the column just gets wiped out with no compensation
2011-11-10T03:40:49  <pairofdice> That's weird
2011-11-10T03:41:02  <janzert> oh you have to run the map with the -scenario option of course
2011-11-10T03:41:28  <userjjb> I don't think the game would be broken per se with 2 wide corridors, but ant walls would be a *very* strong strategy
2011-11-10T03:41:55  <userjjb> pretty much mandatory against anyone else who uses them

2011-11-10T03:42:56  <pairofdice> Well okay sure, but to my knowledge, uniformly wide corridors don't allow one block to be n+2 while the other can be only n
2011-11-10T03:43:31  <userjjb> except at entrances to "rooms" or at "T" junctions
2011-11-10T03:43:36  <janzert> the wall is placed at the end outside of the corridor
2011-11-10T03:44:18  <pairofdice> Yeah...
2011-11-10T03:44:22  <userjjb> also, with the current "hairyness" in maze maps, if a corridor was 2 wide it might be possible to find a spot in a corridor where a 1 wide divot occurs on either side of the corridor
2011-11-10T03:44:23  <pairofdice> okay
2011-11-10T03:46:54  <pairofdice> Because the ant attack radius makes a block 3 at sides with a dent in the corners
2011-11-10T03:47:20  <pairofdice> Well the dent doesn't matter just the size
2011-11-10T03:48:52  <userjjb> right, if you're familiar with elctromagnetic physics, it's akin to the electric field at a certain distance away from an "infinite" line of charge

2011-11-10T03:55:26  <userjjb> Right, well the thing is that a formation is always weak at it's corners or edges, so it's easy to defeat if you are trying to, but if the opponents ants don't bother moving in at least 2's it's easy to kill individual ants

2011-11-10T06:17:22  <Zaphus> it takes a fair bit of time to see your ranking on the official server... I uploaded one two days ago and it's managed 7 games so far
2011-11-10T06:17:59  <ericlavigne> I would like my bots to print messages to my while running a game on my own computer, but it seems like playgame.py captures both standard-input and standard-error streams, and even blocks writing to files. What is a good way to do logging?
2011-11-10T06:18:29  <thakidd> hello im kind of a newb programmer and i was hoping someone can give me some help i would like to prevent the ants from oscillating any ideas?
2011-11-10T06:19:04  <ikaros> ericlavigne, use -e option for playgame.py
2011-11-10T06:19:19  <Zaphus> what does -e do ?
2011-11-10T06:19:26  <ikaros> redirect stderr
2011-11-10T06:19:41  <thakidd> i wanted to implore a last turn order list type idea but not sure how to institute it
2011-11-10T06:19:46  <ikaros> but writing to files should work anyways
2011-11-10T06:19:48  <ericlavigne> ikaros: I was using -e from the beginning. Adding -E made some error logs appear in the gamelog directory, but those files are always empty :-(
2011-11-10T06:20:09  <ericlavigne> I was very surprised when writing to file didn't work.

2011-11-10T06:21:04  <retybok> thakidd: using a global list means you don't have to track individual ants

2011-11-10T06:22:44  <thakidd> retybok: right but how do i add to the list and clear it effectively
2011-11-10T06:23:05  <ikaros> ericlavigne, have you perhaps looked for your log files in the wring directory?
2011-11-10T06:23:19  <retybok> thakidd: I'm not going to tell you everything ;-) but that simple idea is enough to get ranked 1500th
2011-11-10T06:23:21  <ikaros> because writing to file isnt blocked for sure
2011-11-10T06:24:12  <thakidd> retybok: the problem i have is i know some very effective techniques but im unclear on the code to implement them
2011-11-10T06:24:44  <ericlavigne> ikaros, Maybe there are logs in more than one directory? The game creates a folder called game_logs  in same directory as I run it from. The error files in that directory are empty. When I write to a file myself, I use an absolute path, so I'm certain that I look in the right place for that.
2011-11-10T06:24:57  <ikaros> hmm
2011-11-10T06:24:58  <thakidd> retybok: i just need a helping hand with the java code itself not the ideas
2011-11-10T06:25:32  <ericlavigne> thakidd: Have you used the tutorial? It includes example Java code for each step.
2011-11-10T06:25:33  <ikaros> the game_logs folder is something different .. i think its for replays or so
2011-11-10T06:26:02  <ericlavigne> ikaros: Then maybe I am looking in the wrong place. Where would you expect error logs for my bots to go?
2011-11-10T06:26:04  <ikaros> but you should have some kind of io errors if writing to disk fails
2011-11-10T06:26:20  <ikaros> well you say you used an absolute path so.. there :)
2011-11-10T06:27:04  <thakidd> retybok: i have but i want to get away from the manhattan algorithm and use a* along with my no backsies idea just not sure how to populate the list each turn and then clear it out
2011-11-10T06:27:09  <ericlavigne> ikaros, checked the absolute path. That io function works fine when invoked from outside the game.
2011-11-10T06:27:27  <ikaros> check if writing to disk fails in your source and just terminate the bot then
2011-11-10T06:28:00  <ikaros> so at least you see if the function fails or if its something different
2011-11-10T06:28:57  <ericlavigne> ikaros, good point. I can read the file back immediately after a write. If contents aren't what I expect, throw an exception.

2011-11-10T07:01:25  <caution> in the top 100, it's something like 8 python vs 35 C++
2011-11-10T07:02:24  <caution> there are speed comparisons between languages that can be found online
2011-11-10T07:02:28  <retybok> you can use python, but it means you have to be very careful
2011-11-10T07:02:32  <JanneP_> the sample python bots seem to take ages to process their turns, at least compared to my C bot
2011-11-10T07:02:34  <Zaphus> thats probably the equivalent ratio of peoples experience with the languages as well
2011-11-10T07:02:36  <ericlavigne> JanneP_ if you're writing loops where a small amount of work is done in each loop, python is at least 100 times slower. Difference can be a lot smaller if you can do most work in well maintained libraries.
2011-11-10T07:02:51  <retybok> I use Go, I've found it's a good tradeoff
2011-11-10T07:03:10  <caution> do you work for Google?
2011-11-10T07:03:16  <retybok> nope
2011-11-10T07:03:27  <retybok> I just took the challenge as an opportunity to learn the language
2011-11-10T07:03:48  <caution> what's your preferred language and how are you finding Go in comparison?
2011-11-10T07:06:17  <retybok> I usually use python. Go is not as expressive, but it's pretty good and it's a lot faster
2011-11-10T07:06:32  <retybok> The tools shipped with the language are pretty good (the profiler for example)
2011-11-10T07:07:03  <retybok> And the static typing with type inference is actually a pretty good thing, ie. it catches a few errors that take time to debug in python
2011-11-10T07:07:29  <jix> retybok: have you had a look at scala?
2011-11-10T07:07:30  <caution> I don't like the look of the syntax

2011-11-10T07:09:50  <retybok> jix: it looks like a decent language.
2011-11-10T07:10:09  <jix> retybok: yeah that's the language I decided to learn for this contest and I'm pretty happy with it (apart from the rather longish compile times)
2011-11-10T07:10:55  <retybok> jix: Go has a very lightweight feeling: extremely fast compilation, instant program start (since no JVM to start), etc.

2011-11-10T09:01:19  <antimatroid> if you take 2x2 simultaneous games where each player can totally order the pure strategy space there are 144 ordinal equivalence classes
2011-11-10T09:01:25  <antimatroid> games are ridiculous
2011-11-10T09:01:50  <pairofdice> Nah, just some approaches to games
2011-11-10T09:01:53  <userjjb> You could reduce the space by a bit if you factor in that not all states are achievable game configurations

2011-11-10T10:39:55  <Khaki> why do a lot of bots, even the top ones, jitter ant movements? i.e. repeatedly move between two squares?
2011-11-10T10:41:54  <NoxiaZ^> liberforce, yes on the official server. - The reason why i ask is becuase of the performce, i know how many right now i can control at same time, if its get over, it will be hard.

2011-11-10T10:42:38  <NoxiaZ^> So lets say if i can control 200 ants before the 500 ms, and you never reach more then 100 ants, i dont wanna spend more time on performce

2011-11-10T10:42:49  <Khaki> I see
2011-11-10T10:43:06  <antimatroid> there's actually another good reason for it
2011-11-10T10:43:14  <antimatroid> stationary ants may prevent food from spawning until they move

2011-11-10T10:43:38  <delt0r> NoxiaZ^: there is really no upper bound to the amount of ants you can get other than than the upper bound of food for a given map
2011-11-10T10:44:19  <NoxiaZ^> delt0r, ahh oki
2011-11-10T10:44:19  <delt0r> antimatroid, Khaki: also you see more if you move... however that does not really mean moving back and forward one square
2011-11-10T10:45:00  <liberforce> NoxiaZ^: sometimes i get a timeout around 130, sometimes at 170
2011-11-10T10:45:19  <Khaki> antimatroid, in that case it seems like a quirk in the rules
2011-11-10T10:45:58  <antimatroid> hard to keep food spawning symmetric otherwise
2011-11-10T10:46:15  <NoxiaZ^> liberforce, ye and thats pretty bad - Right now with this setup i will be able to handle 100 ants, but if it gets higher it will be hard
2011-11-10T10:46:23  <NoxiaZ^> And then i need to comeup with some new idea
2011-11-10T10:46:23  <antimatroid> unless you allows bots to potentially affect where food can/'t spawn elsewhere on the map
2011-11-10T10:46:24  <delt0r> I doubt many bots are doing this from a food spawning perspective
2011-11-10T10:46:57  <antimatroid> delt0r_: i would suggest it might be worth moving non-moved ants at the end of each turn for this purpose
2011-11-10T10:47:11  <liberforce> NoxiaZ^: if you're afraid to timeout if you have to many ants, just make an ant remain on top of your hill once you've reach the count
2011-11-10T10:47:17  <antimatroid> so if you want an ant to be stationary make that as a "move" with your bot
2011-11-10T10:47:37  <antimatroid> oh, it's 11/11/11
2011-11-10T10:47:53  <liberforce> antimatroid: not here ;)

2011-11-10T10:50:47  <pairofdice> I would rather find the timehog and fix it
2011-11-10T10:51:16  <NoxiaZ^> pairofdice, there will be a point where you cant do it between the 500 ms
2011-11-10T10:51:30  <liberforce> NoxiaZ^: that way if you fall below your max ant count, you can make that one move and another will spawn
2011-11-10T10:51:35  <NoxiaZ^> thats just impossible to fix
2011-11-10T10:51:48  <NoxiaZ^> liberforce, thats really good idea! :)
2011-11-10T10:51:54  <pairofdice> The number of ants I have don't considerably raise my turntimes

2011-11-10T10:54:23  <NoxiaZ^> pairofdice, so again if its possible to get 400 ants you wont be able to handle all
2011-11-10T10:54:37  <liberforce> pairofdice: do you use an anti-object approach ?
2011-11-10T10:54:39  <NoxiaZ^> And as i dont know how many ants you can get in a single round, you have to deal with that problem

2011-11-10T10:57:29  <pairofdice> If I can't do that anymore, then sure, block ants

2011-11-10T11:29:15  <pairofdice> I don't think so
2011-11-10T11:29:53  <liberforce> well do you directly control the ants, or do you perform the computation on the tiles and let the ants go their own way ?
2011-11-10T11:30:26  <pairofdice> I guess I do in that I calculate one map and let ants decide where they go
2011-11-10T11:30:47  <liberforce> ok, so it's an anti-object approach

2011-11-10T12:02:33  <liberforce> easier to optimize for me
2011-11-10T12:02:44  <delt0r> that is an important point
2011-11-10T12:02:45  <liberforce> but lack of queue, lists, etc is boring
2011-11-10T12:02:59  <liberforce> had to reimplement some basic stuff
2011-11-10T12:03:00  <delt0r> what you know can make more difference to performance that the "lanuage"
2011-11-10T12:03:11  <liberforce> yep

2011-11-10T12:03:34  <delt0r> half the C vers java performance wars are because a C programmer writes crap java, and a java programmer bad C
2011-11-10T12:03:39  <p_l> delt0r: Common Lisp
2011-11-10T12:03:41  <liberforce> heard python bot would easily timeout
2011-11-10T12:03:47  <delt0r> p_l: i like lisp
2011-11-10T12:03:57  <delt0r> almost used it this time round

2011-11-10T12:04:15  <delt0r> was thinking of one of the lisp dialects on the JVM
2011-11-10T12:04:21  <p_l> I get too annoyed by Java to work with it
2011-11-10T12:04:34  <delt0r> p_l: you do get over it... trust me
2011-11-10T12:04:35  <p_l> Since my preferred implementation is available, why not use it :)
2011-11-10T12:04:40  <delt0r> indeed
2011-11-10T12:04:40  <p_l> delt0r: no, it only grows
2011-11-10T12:05:05  <delt0r> My first recursion was with lisp
2011-11-10T12:05:15  <delt0r> back when i was a wee lad
2011-11-10T12:05:22  <p_l> delt0r: Java the language itself, or JVM as the bytecode platform, isn't that bad... but then the libs come in... *pukes*
2011-11-10T12:05:34  <delt0r> its the libs i like
2011-11-10T12:05:53  <p_l> delt0r: I dislike certain patterns that are very popular in many libs in Java.
2011-11-10T12:06:01  <p_l> I'm going to stay with Common Lisp :)
2011-11-10T12:06:08  <delt0r> seriously diffenct tcp code on different OSes but same hardware in 2011? WTF?
2011-11-10T12:06:41  <delt0r> p_l: that is the same in every land IMO ...and even experience. There is always some clug
2011-11-10T12:06:48  <delt0r> lang
2011-11-10T12:06:51  <delt0r> not land
2011-11-10T12:07:11  <delt0r> but there is a government analogy in there somewhere ;)
2011-11-10T12:07:20  <delt0r> p_l: how is your bot going?
2011-11-10T12:07:29  <p_l> delt0r: the difference for me is that CL gives me enough power to technically rewrite anything I need fast... which is annoying when you're getting detracted from writing something by urge to implement your own database
2011-11-10T12:07:40  <delt0r> lol

2011-11-10T12:17:52  <mcstar> p_l: what i missed the most in cl, interestingly is the compiler
2011-11-10T12:17:58  <p_l> I know a little of how to use SBCL's assembler
2011-11-10T12:18:10  <mcstar> meaning, its easier for me to write correct c++ code, beacuse it catches type error
2011-11-10T12:18:12  <mcstar> s
2011-11-10T12:18:36  <p_l> mcstar: use SBCL with full safety on. You'll get tons of warnings :)
2011-11-10T12:18:48  <mcstar> ill do next time
2011-11-10T12:19:13  <p_l> also, you can catch more by defining the types
2011-11-10T12:19:16  <mcstar> i decided to learn c++ too, cause itnerestingly there are jobs offers requring c++ skill

2011-11-10T12:36:18  <bergmark> Is there any way to tell if a hill has been destroyed other than if you razed it yourself?  In other words just because you don't see a hill there doesn't mean its not still there but below another ant right?

2011-11-10T12:40:40  <hanshoi> bergmark: I believe the hills positions are told, regardles of the fact that there is a ant on it or not.
2011-11-10T12:41:33  <hanshoi> it's after that up to the starter package how to use that information.
2011-11-10T12:42:12  <amstan_> bergmark: the engine only tells you there's a hill if it wasn't rased already
2011-11-10T12:42:32  <amstan_> so if you don't recieve info about a hill that you remember being there it means it was razed

2011-11-10T13:49:11  <mcstar> aha
2011-11-10T13:49:21  <mcstar> so for example vector<int> vec;
2011-11-10T13:49:29  <mcstar> doesnt initialize the vector?
2011-11-10T13:49:41  <mcstar> i cant call .size() on it?
2011-11-10T13:50:17  <Conorach> vector<int> vec(size, default);
2011-11-10T13:50:56  <Conorach> normally done in constructor initialization.
2011-11-10T13:51:26  <mcstar> no, its ook
2011-11-10T13:51:37  <Conorach> ok, sorry :)
2011-11-10T13:51:43  <mcstar> you see, i could always use a vector if i did like that
2011-11-10T13:51:56  <mcstar> but now i got a segfault, but it seems because of something else
2011-11-10T13:52:10  <Conorach> :(
2011-11-10T13:52:15  <mcstar> i could list all the sizes of my vectors, so they must have got initialized
2011-11-10T13:54:32  <mcstar> valgrind says im using something uninitialized

2011-11-10T20:59:56  <amstan> janzert: i got to tell jeff to come here sometime, apparently he's very busy
2011-11-10T21:00:16  <amstan> janzert: i also broke the workers 2 days ago, then fixed them
2011-11-10T21:00:24  <janzert> :) ok
2011-11-10T21:00:31  <amstan> i restarted memcached, so the latest_game was gone
2011-11-10T21:00:33  <amstan> then i waited
2011-11-10T21:00:37  <amstan> and after an hour it didn't come back
2011-11-10T21:00:44  <janzert> heh
2011-11-10T21:01:00  <amstan> so i looked around, accessed a random page on the site, game_list_json i think
2011-11-10T21:01:05  <amstan> and that made mysql hang
2011-11-10T21:01:07  <amstan> so the workers died
2011-11-10T21:01:17  <janzert> hmm
2011-11-10T21:01:31  <amstan> yeah, it doesn't seem like a good idea to have a random page that can hang the whole contest
2011-11-10T21:02:03  <janzert> I assume it's a query that is just taking forever long?
2011-11-10T21:02:11  <amstan> probably
2011-11-10T21:02:36  <amstan> janzert: also.. are we interested in game servers? 3 nodes, in total: 36 cores(3.0GHz Xeon), 430GB ram
2011-11-10T21:03:18  <amstan> that's equivalent to 18 workers
2011-11-10T21:03:22  <amstan> ec2 workers
2011-11-10T21:03:55  <janzert> in some ways, but on the other hand I expect it to take a fair bit of work to get them running
2011-11-10T21:04:07  <amstan> why?
2011-11-10T21:04:34  <janzert> they really have 143GB of ram per machine?

2011-11-10T21:05:41  <amstan> janzert: problem is that we'll only be able to get them at the end of november if we do
2011-11-10T21:05:49  <janzert> we haven't run more than one worker on a machine in quite a while so I would expect to run into various problems there. they are inevitably going to be different than the ec2 setup and of course we can't just kill one and get another one back with a bare OS install

2011-11-10T21:06:23  <amstan> they're going to have esxi installed on them, so snapshots should be fairly easy to do
2011-11-10T21:06:24  <janzert> that's one of the really nice things about ec2 of course
2011-11-10T21:06:54  <janzert> and anyone with access will need to be withdrawn from the contest of course

2011-11-10T21:07:39  <amstan> janzert: so what's the final decision?
2011-11-10T21:08:06  <janzert> I don't really know at this point
2011-11-10T21:08:19  <janzert> just it's not a really simple thing to add them
2011-11-10T21:08:20  <amstan> ok, well, we have time still
2011-11-10T21:08:28  <amstan> and we need to have to find out if we do get them
2011-11-10T21:08:38  <amstan> the deal is to get them advertisment like google
2011-11-10T21:09:07  <janzert> If we can get other sponsors we should create a section at the bottom of the page with the names and logos
2011-11-10T21:09:23  <amstan> yeah
2011-11-10T21:09:25  <janzert> and I think we could get more if we can get Jeff back around
2011-11-10T21:09:53  <janzert> I wouldn't want to add more names into the header btw

2011-11-10T23:29:10  <nickjohnson> Using Collaborative Diffusion or a similar strategy that relies on marking up map squares with values, you're already doing that.

2011-11-10T23:29:35  <nickjohnson> Rinum: Right, so you make the value of unexplored squares something higher than explored squares and diffuse them
2011-11-10T23:29:43  <nickjohnson> You're already looping over the whole area to diffuse 'scents'

2011-11-10T23:30:23  <nickjohnson> In mine, I made squares outside line-of-sight emit a 'food' smell at about half the level of actual food
2011-11-10T23:30:34  <nickjohnson> Rinum: Which you use is up to you
2011-11-10T23:30:43  <Rinum> I do that too, but my bot times out
2011-11-10T23:30:46  <nickjohnson> Depends if you want good live coverage of the map, or just want to explore the whole thing at least once
2011-11-10T23:30:52  <nickjohnson> What language are you using?
2011-11-10T23:30:55  <Rinum> C++
2011-11-10T23:31:04  <nickjohnson> You must be doing something fairly slow, then
2011-11-10T23:31:12  <nickjohnson> I can do a few iterations per turn over the whole map in Python
2011-11-10T23:31:18  <nickjohnson> Though I'm thinking of moving to Go so I can do more
2011-11-10T23:31:29  <nickjohnson> Have you tried profiling your code?
2011-11-10T23:31:37  <Rinum> well I'm trying to get the scent to travel the entire map... that could be why
2011-11-10T23:32:16  <BenJackson_> my C++ bot only took about 5ms to run when it was doing only something CD like
2011-11-10T23:32:26  <nickjohnson> Using BFS, or just by iterating multiple times?

2011-11-10T23:32:41  <nickjohnson> With typical CD, you just do some number of diffusion steps per game step, and keep the diffusion map between turns
2011-11-10T23:32:55  <Rinum> nickjohnson: BFS
2011-11-10T23:32:55  <BenJackson_> I re-evaluate everything every turn
2011-11-10T23:33:04  <BenJackson_> but it's not really CD
2011-11-10T23:33:16  <Rinum> i've been re-evaluating each turn
2011-11-10T23:33:26  <nickjohnson> Even then you should be able to do something fairly quickly. Your BFS can prune branches that encounter another unexplored square, or one with a shorter distance to an unexplored squarew.
2011-11-10T23:33:27  <BenJackson_> a correct BFS should be equivalent in cost to just iterating once across the map
2011-11-10T23:33:38  <nickjohnson> BenJackson_: Yes, but per source, not in total.
2011-11-10T23:33:57  <BenJackson_> you can do all equivalent sources in one traversal
2011-11-10T23:34:16  <nickjohnson> Hm, I suppose you can. That's not really BFS, but the effect is the same.
2011-11-10T23:34:24  <BenJackson_> sure it is
2011-11-10T23:34:29  <BenJackson_> the root is just not a grid square
2011-11-10T23:34:34  <BenJackson_> it's some imaginary concept like "food"
2011-11-10T23:34:44  <nickjohnson> Fair enough
2011-11-10T23:34:46  <BenJackson_> all of the children of that root are your first queue
2011-11-10T23:34:51  <nickjohnson> Hylaean Breadth First Search ;)
2011-11-10T23:35:17  <nickjohnson> AKA Platonic - (http://anathem.wikia.com/wiki/Hylaean_Theoric_World)
2011-11-10T23:36:08  <BenJackson_> I like to keep my bot fast because it's quicker to iterate
2011-11-10T23:36:16  <BenJackson_> my first python version was annoyingly slow to debug
2011-11-10T23:36:30  <BenJackson_> and timed out without careful time controls
2011-11-10T23:36:35  <nickjohnson> This is why I'm thinking of switching to Go
2011-11-10T23:36:44  <nickjohnson> As much as I love Python, it's not up to scratch speed-wise for this challenge
2011-11-10T23:36:49  <BenJackson_> the C++ version has probably never taken more than 25ms to compute a turn even with 250 ants
2011-11-10T23:37:23  <BenJackson_> actually the early versions were probably O(map size) and didn't care about ant counts at all
2011-11-10T23:37:25  * nickjohnson is also pretty sure the Python starter kit was written by someone who isn't that familiar with Python, which is odd since the server is written in Python
2011-11-10T23:37:39  <nickjohnson> BenJackson_: Well, you still have to iterate over the ants to give them orders
2011-11-10T23:37:42  <BenJackson_> the server is not in the most fluent python either

2011-11-10T23:38:29  <BenJackson_> sure, but board size is like 150*150 or ~ 22000 and you have <100 ants most of the time
2011-11-10T23:38:30  <Rinum> is there a way to change the turn time?
2011-11-10T23:38:53  <BenJackson_> playgame.py has a ton of options
2011-11-10T23:39:01  <BenJackson_> including --turntime and --loadtime
2011-11-10T23:39:38  <BenJackson_> nickjohnson: I meant more in constrast now when my bot uses algorithms that are n^2 in ants or worse
2011-11-10T23:39:52  <nickjohnson> ouch
2011-11-10T23:40:00  <BenJackson_> I benchmarked a n^3 algorithm that would have been fine for 300+ ants
2011-11-10T23:40:38  <nickjohnson> Still doing CD stuff, or something entirely different?
2011-11-10T23:41:04  <BenJackson_> no, that was an entirely different idea which I didn't end up using

2011-11-10T23:42:09  <BenJackson_> I'm not really doing CD at all, just something similar
2011-11-10T23:42:13  <BenJackson_> I hadn't heard of CD when I started
2011-11-10T23:43:30  <Rinum> seems like everyone is doing CD now x.x
2011-11-10T23:44:42  <BenJackson_> hopefully there won't be a similar revelation in combat
2011-11-10T23:44:52  <BenJackson_> right now combat is what stratifies the top tier

2011-11-10T23:46:11  <Rinum> yup
2011-11-10T23:47:59  <BenJackson_> also if it turns out combat is as easy as CD-like structures are for overall strategy I'm going to feel really dumb
2011-11-10T23:50:16  <Rinum> lol ditto
2011-11-10T23:50:50  <Rinum> i bet xathis' strategy is so simple

2011-11-10T23:52:28  <twymer> is CD really that popular? it seemed like something that wouldn't hold up well at high tiers
2011-11-10T23:52:54  <BenJackson_> there's still a ton of refinements to what you put INTO your "CD-like" algorithm
2011-11-10T23:53:09  <BenJackson_> starter packages don't even remember hills, for example
2011-11-10T23:53:51  <BenJackson_> after my reloaded bot played some ~500 level bots I got curious about what a "low sigma" 500-600th place bot was like
2011-11-10T23:53:56  <BenJackson_> so I watched some games

2011-11-10T23:54:44  <BenJackson_> one funny moment involved a bot which found a hill, sent a huge force to cap it, and didn't give up until it stepped on the square where the hill was, even though it was captured shortly after first being sighted
2011-11-10T23:54:51  <BenJackson_> meanwhile that same bot got ninja capped at his base
2011-11-10T23:55:40  <Rinum> it's really the combat strat that creates the rankings

2011-11-10T23:56:14  <Rinum> lol I've been doing that
2011-11-10T23:56:24  <BenJackson_> one that seeks food and suicides at hills
2011-11-10T23:56:29  <BenJackson_> one with combat, etc
2011-11-10T23:56:39  <BenJackson_> combat seems to be top-25 right now

2011-11-10T23:56:48  <Rinum> skill ~30s solely food gathering
2011-11-10T23:56:52  <BenJackson_> certainly I looked at some 50-60 level bots that appeared to be oblivious
2011-11-10T23:56:57  <Rinum> ~40s very basic combat
2011-11-10T23:57:17  <Rinum> ~50s slightly more basic combat (much like what you described)
2011-11-10T23:57:22  <Rinum> etc.
2011-11-10T23:57:26  <BenJackson_> Rinum: I was thinking of actually writing a program to consume replays and do an analysis
2011-11-10T23:57:39  <Rinum> sounds tough

2011-11-10T23:57:57  <BenJackson_> you could easily measure how many combat events came out numerically in favor of a bot
2011-11-10T23:58:11  <BenJackson_> how rapidly it feeds, etc
2011-11-10T23:58:39  <Rinum> maybe if I were currently dominating the competition I would think about doing something like that x.x but for now... must improve the bot!
2011-11-10T23:59:39  <Rinum> I'm kind of surprised my non-CD, slow python bot made it to the 60s
2011-11-10T23:59:42  <Rinum> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=3469
2011-11-10T23:59:50  <BenJackson_> your python bot has a higher skill than mine did before I abandoned it :)
