2012-04-12T07:24:32  <antimatroid> i dunno anything about cryptography, one guess is that each 3 symbols is a number in base 5, try all combinations of assigning numbers to the symbols, convert each 3 symbols from base 5 to base 26 and see if the 23 words that come out make any sense

2012-04-12T07:30:16  <mcstar> i dont think that really is cryptography
2012-04-12T07:31:21  <mcstar> what you linked is like, decyphering the hieroglyps
2012-04-12T07:32:17  <pairofdice> If it's not a different language then it's more like crypto
2012-04-12T07:33:29  <pairofdice> And just english coded into dots, dashed  and stuff
2012-04-12T07:34:30  <pairofdice> And if it's english, you can use the patterns of english to attack it
2012-04-12T07:34:32  <mcstar> im naked, and it started to rain, and i have to bring inside the hanging dry clothes

2012-04-12T07:37:38  <pairofdice> I guess it encodes a single character in a set of three .... symbols
2012-04-12T07:37:45  <pairofdice> 5 symbols...
2012-04-12T07:40:01  <pairofdice> maybe they map it to ascii
2012-04-12T07:40:06  <pairofdice> let's see

2012-04-12T07:42:09  <mcstar> thats what pairofdice tried to say
2012-04-12T07:44:19  <mcstar> well 5*5*5 is close to 7 bits
2012-04-12T07:44:31  <mcstar> and that is the original ascii

2012-04-12T07:44:52  <mcstar> i would try to break by space
2012-04-12T07:45:04  <mcstar> since thats the most frequent character
2012-04-12T07:45:17  <mcstar> or 'e' if there are not too many words
2012-04-12T07:45:36  <mcstar> it is just 23 characters long after all
2012-04-12T07:45:40  <pairofdice> only ... repeats
2012-04-12T07:45:58  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-12T07:46:07  <mcstar> but you dont start with space
2012-04-12T07:46:10  <pairofdice> of and _s_
2012-04-12T07:46:15  <pairofdice> oh*
2012-04-12T07:46:26  <pairofdice> s=square
2012-04-12T07:46:36  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-12T07:46:45  <pairofdice> that could be space
2012-04-12T07:47:21  <pairofdice> I don't know, there being not many repeats is fishy
2012-04-12T07:47:34  <pairofdice> oh! __s
2012-04-12T07:47:58  <mcstar> what?
2012-04-12T07:48:05  <mcstar> shit
2012-04-12T07:48:07  <mcstar> that too
2012-04-12T07:48:11  <pairofdice> and ._.

2012-04-12T07:48:23  <pairofdice> so blind
2012-04-12T07:48:37  <mcstar> damn
2012-04-12T07:48:46  <mcstar> but that underscore is a bit up
2012-04-12T07:48:58  <mcstar> my recognition software is too precise
2012-04-12T07:49:16  <mcstar> ill set a bigger variance
2012-04-12T07:50:10  <pairofdice> But if it's Klingon or something this gets a lot harder
2012-04-12T07:51:10  <mcstar> why?
2012-04-12T07:51:23  <mcstar> it becomes easier
2012-04-12T07:51:30  <mcstar> they use a lot of `
2012-04-12T07:51:34  <mcstar> '
2012-04-12T07:51:58  <mcstar> anyway, i started programming

2012-04-12T07:52:25  <antimatroid> i am curious on an answer though
2012-04-12T08:04:35  <pairofdice> would be easier if the message was longer
2012-04-12T08:05:23  <mcstar> ok, it is digitized

2012-04-12T08:09:59  <mcstar> no
2012-04-12T08:10:14  <mcstar> i tried all ascii encodings
2012-04-12T08:10:46  <thestinger> what is it?
2012-04-12T08:10:53  <pairofdice> nothing
2012-04-12T08:10:53  <mcstar> this comes close: '#oP-(\x8c#$QF2(EO&6Q~\x9dE=@w'
2012-04-12T08:11:06  <mcstar> almost intelligibel
2012-04-12T08:11:37  <mcstar> ill refine my encoding

2012-04-12T08:22:53  <thestinger> it's a secret message from a duck?

2012-04-12T08:45:15  <mcstar> can i nest def?
2012-04-12T08:45:18  <thestinger> yes
2012-04-12T08:45:35  <thestinger> check out the nonlocal keyword too (was added in python3), you need that for proper closures
2012-04-12T08:45:58  <thestinger> at least for mutable captured vars
2012-04-12T08:46:14  <mcstar> :( not working

2012-04-12T08:47:51  <mcstar> it is commonplace in scheme

2012-04-12T08:48:23  <mcstar> but python lambda doest support multiple expressions

2012-04-12T08:49:18  <thestinger> the inner function?
2012-04-12T08:49:56  <mcstar> the definition is in a file, that i import from the toplevel
2012-04-12T08:50:18  <mcstar> and now when i call my assigned function, it doesnt find it, cause of the module name
2012-04-12T08:50:36  <thestinger> show me an example
2012-04-12T08:51:05  <mcstar> just like yourpaste..
2012-04-12T08:51:13  <thestinger> this works when I import it somewhere else

2012-04-12T09:35:54  <thestinger> just need to turn off the absolutely hideous scrollbar and it's great
2012-04-12T09:35:55  <mcstar> i dont know where i was
2012-04-12T09:36:29  <mcstar> i must have checked 50x256 possibilities i think
2012-04-12T09:40:41  <thestinger> lol... coursera needs to fix their video player
2012-04-12T09:40:57  <thestinger> I "watched" 5 minutes of video wondering why he wasn't writing anything
2012-04-12T09:41:09  <thestinger> then I realized it was playing audio and moving the progress bar but not rendering the video...
2012-04-12T09:41:22  <mcstar> urxvt sucks
2012-04-12T09:41:37  <thestinger> everything else sucks more
2012-04-12T09:41:39  <mcstar> after each print a get a bunch of characters on the input line
2012-04-12T09:41:43  <mcstar> i*
2012-04-12T09:41:50  <mcstar> and i must press enter

2012-04-12T10:32:09  <mcstar> yeah, guy is correct
2012-04-12T10:32:16  <mcstar> thats why i tried ascii first
2012-04-12T10:32:29  <mcstar> cause then you have like 32k possibilities
2012-04-12T10:32:33  <mcstar> but thats a no go
2012-04-12T10:33:58  <pairofdice> ?
2012-04-12T10:34:08  <mcstar> what?
2012-04-12T10:35:47  <pairofdice> Did you try the 125 permutations of the symbols
2012-04-12T10:36:45  <pairofdice> 120*
2012-04-12T10:36:50  <mcstar> yes
2012-04-12T10:37:06  <mcstar> i interpreted as a base 5 number
2012-04-12T10:37:11  <pairofdice> yeah
2012-04-12T10:37:20  <mcstar> and tried all 256 offsets
2012-04-12T10:37:26  <mcstar> so thats 256*120
2012-04-12T10:37:48  <mcstar> and i sorted by how many characters fall into 'A'..'z'

2012-04-12T10:38:39  <mcstar> but if you interpret the cipher, as 19 different symbols, any one of which can stand for any of the 26 letters, you get 26!/(26-19)!
2012-04-12T10:38:43  <mcstar> nothing
2012-04-12T10:38:48  <pairofdice> I guess it needs heavier weaponry

2012-04-12T10:40:15  <mcstar> crypto is much more easy XD
2012-04-12T10:40:23  <mcstar> easier*
2012-04-12T10:40:43  <pairofdice> cs373 exam was too easy
2012-04-12T10:40:53  <a1k0n> pairofdice: no kidding
2012-04-12T10:41:08  <a1k0n> pgm-class.org OTOH is a pain in the ass
2012-04-12T10:41:27  <mcstar> the description sounded good
2012-04-12T10:42:02  <a1k0n> udacity's site is very weird.
2012-04-12T10:44:50  <thestinger> the cs373 was waaaaay too easy/boring

2012-04-12T10:45:40  <a1k0n> i'm kind of glad it was easy cuz i had to do it in the hour before it was due
2012-04-12T10:45:43  <thestinger> a1k0n: I'm loving the coursera algo class
2012-04-12T10:45:56  <a1k0n> these UTC deadlines are killing me
2012-04-12T10:45:59  <thestinger> glad mcstar convinced me to do it :)
2012-04-12T10:46:08  <mcstar> did i?
2012-04-12T10:46:11  <thestinger> yes
2012-04-12T10:46:18  <a1k0n> with pgm i don't really have time for any other class
2012-04-12T10:46:21  <mcstar> i thought i convinced you to take crypto
2012-04-12T10:46:31  <mcstar> thestinger: youre right
2012-04-12T10:46:33  <thestinger> mcstar: you told me about crypto and I started it, but you had to convince me to do the algo
2012-04-12T10:46:39  <mcstar> you were choosing between this and udacity
2012-04-12T10:46:55  <thestinger> a1k0n: the cs101 exam was harder
2012-04-12T10:47:13  <thestinger> had to implement levenshtein distance and some other stuff
2012-04-12T10:47:19  <a1k0n> nice
2012-04-12T10:47:29  <thestinger> those were the "starred" questions though
2012-04-12T10:47:35  <thestinger> they were basically bonus questions :P
2012-04-12T10:48:14  <a1k0n> i even got the starred question on the cs373 exam right after taking a quick guess, to my surprise
2012-04-12T10:48:18  <thestinger> cs101 was actually a great course, I've been suggesting it to lots of people
