2011-03-16T00:00:42  <McLeopold> build systems?
2011-03-16T00:00:54  <McLeopold> Let's stick with compile anything
2011-03-16T00:01:21  <McLeopold> And let's say binary submission are not until zeta
2011-03-16T00:01:30  <McLeopold> we are behind on launch enough already
2011-03-16T00:01:44  <amstan> ok
2011-03-16T00:02:07  <McLeopold> But I will add lolcode :D
2011-03-16T00:02:13  <janzert> if you just want binary submissions they can be added into the current compilation framework easy enough
2011-03-16T00:02:27  <janzert> don't need to be done before launch either
2011-03-16T00:02:38  <amstan> janzert: yeah.. leave it for during the contest
2011-03-16T00:02:49  <McLeopold> okay, but lets do everything else first
2011-03-16T00:03:27  <McLeopold> janzert: you in etherpad?
2011-03-16T00:03:46  <janzert> glancing at it occasionally yes
2011-03-16T00:04:29  <McLeopold> janzert: can you put your name in?
2011-03-16T00:04:54  <janzert> ok, did
2011-03-16T00:05:07  <janzert> not sure why though :)
2011-03-16T00:05:17  <janzert> have nothing to add right now
2011-03-16T00:05:25  <McLeopold> so I know which color is a lurker?
2011-03-16T00:06:12  <amstan> lol
2011-03-16T00:06:26  <amstan> McLeopold: you can play with their names, i just did
2011-03-16T00:07:08  <McLeopold> sweet
2011-03-16T00:07:19  <amstan> McLeopold: so.. still, i wanna be able to play with stuff
2011-03-16T00:07:28  <amstan> McLeopold: but the only thing i have working currently is the engine
2011-03-16T00:07:50  <amstan> McLeopold: i'm unclear on what works and what doesn't, and what i need to do to make it work
2011-03-16T00:07:53  <McLeopold> I'm about to check in the sql...
2011-03-16T00:07:57  <amstan> s/engine/website
2011-03-16T00:08:12  <McLeopold> create some users and submit some bots to start with
2011-03-16T00:08:31  <McLeopold> but, wait for the sql... just a minute
2011-03-16T00:08:32  <janzert> does trueskill_matchups create a database entry that a worker can get as a game task yet?
2011-03-16T00:08:56  <McLeopold> janzert: idk, I've just created my own matches with the same 4 bots
2011-03-16T00:09:07  <janzert> ok
2011-03-16T00:09:58  <McLeopold> antimatroid: anything left to do for the map generator?

2011-03-16T00:13:10  <McLeopold> amstan: ok, pull the sql
2011-03-16T00:13:33  <amstan> not again, lol
2011-03-16T00:14:00  <amstan> nuking my db again, lol
2011-03-16T00:15:56  <amstan> McLeopold: what about compile scripts for starter bots and tools
2011-03-16T00:16:03  <amstan> McLeopold: what do you mean by tools?
2011-03-16T00:16:19  <McLeopold> the starter tools will not be in the starter pack downloads now
2011-03-16T00:16:40  <McLeopold> we need a make file to compile/zip and place in the website dir for download
2011-03-16T00:16:40  <amstan> i see, ok
2011-03-16T00:16:47  <amstan> so just the packaging for the sdk, right?
2011-03-16T00:16:51  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-16T00:17:13  <amstan> where are the tools located?
2011-03-16T00:17:58  <McLeopold> for running a game, you want ants/playgame.py, worker/engine.py, ants/ants.py
2011-03-16T00:18:21  <McLeopold> but my playing with sys.path probably screws that up
2011-03-16T00:19:05  <amstan> ok, so we don't actually have the tools setup for bot makers
2011-03-16T00:19:51  <McLeopold> the tools should include the sample bots in python and java
2011-03-16T00:20:00  <McLeopold> not yet
2011-03-16T00:20:06  <McLeopold> but it is mostly there and clean
2011-03-16T00:20:28  <McLeopold> and the cmd/sh scripts are tools as well
2011-03-16T00:20:34  <amstan> oh.. about sample bots..
2011-03-16T00:20:48  <amstan> what about the java and python starter packs?
2011-03-16T00:20:51  <amstan> are they finished?
2011-03-16T00:21:06  <amstan> like.. are they usable by contestants? are they in a nice form?
2011-03-16T00:22:58  <McLeopold> python is
2011-03-16T00:23:04  <McLeopold> java needs some polish
2011-03-16T00:23:11  <amstan> ok.. let me update the issue
2011-03-16T00:23:12  <McLeopold> I can do the java one right now in about 10 minutes
2011-03-16T00:23:27  <McLeopold> the MyBot.py is the starter pack one
2011-03-16T00:23:55  <amstan> also.. was there any protocol changes recently? there were a lot of starter pack volunteers
2011-03-16T00:24:03  <amstan> and i want to keep them informed of such things
2011-03-16T00:26:38  <amstan> McLeopold: how about separating starter packs from sample bots?
2011-03-16T00:27:11  <McLeopold> I think if we just standardize on starter packs being MyBot.*, then the makefile can sort it out
2011-03-16T00:27:33  <McLeopold> Either way
2011-03-16T00:27:42  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, but the starter pack for a language should not have multiple bots in it
2011-03-16T00:27:48  <amstan> it'll confuse people
2011-03-16T00:27:49  <McLeopold> No
2011-03-16T00:27:53  <McLeopold> not at all
2011-03-16T00:28:08  <amstan> also, what makefile?
2011-03-16T00:28:18  <McLeopold> the one you are going to create?
2011-03-16T00:28:43  <amstan> well.. there is a makefile right now: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/bots/Makefile
2011-03-16T00:28:55  <amstan> but it just archives the folders now
2011-03-16T00:29:04  <amstan> doesn't do any kind of cleanup
2011-03-16T00:29:39  <amstan> but are you saying that the makefile should only keep mybot.*?
2011-03-16T00:29:48  <amstan> what about the dependecies?
2011-03-16T00:30:23  <McLeopold> uh, let's go with separating the starter bots from the example bots
2011-03-16T00:30:39  <McLeopold> that means my python and java support files will be dups
2011-03-16T00:30:48  <McLeopold> does git have a fancy way of dealing with that?
2011-03-16T00:31:13  <amstan> oh yeah
2011-03-16T00:31:26  <amstan> if there's 2 files with the same content, it stores them as one
2011-03-16T00:32:00  <McLeopold> but, I want to modify one and see the changes in the other dir
2011-03-16T00:32:06  <amstan> softlink?
2011-03-16T00:32:13  <McLeopold> and have it work in windows
2011-03-16T00:32:21  <amstan> but i don't get it, why are you going to have dups?
2011-03-16T00:32:36  <McLeopold> if we separate the starter and example bots
2011-03-16T00:32:54  <McLeopold> a fix would need to be done to both
2011-03-16T00:32:59  <amstan> python starter pack will have mybot.py, and ants.py, the sample bots will have the other python bots and ants.py
2011-03-16T00:33:28  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-16T00:33:31  <amstan> ants.py will be the only dup
2011-03-16T00:33:40  <amstan> unless we use softlinks, we'll have to edit them manually
2011-03-16T00:33:44  <McLeopold> yes, so, no fancy git magic?
2011-03-16T00:33:54  <amstan> yes, git can't emulate softlinks
2011-03-16T00:34:34  <amstan> ok, here's my todo list: https://gist.github.com/872013
2011-03-16T00:34:37  <amstan> anything that i should add?
2011-03-16T00:36:17  <McLeopold> the visualizer hookup
2011-03-16T00:37:20  <amstan> oh yes
2011-03-16T00:37:59  <CIA-33> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r3459b91 / (ants/test_bot.sh ants/bots/java/MyBot.java): Added java starter bot. - http://bit.ly/gMenrZ
2011-03-16T00:39:25  <McLeopold> amstan: also, the worker doesn't send emails right now
2011-03-16T00:39:44  <amstan> why does worker have to send emails?
2011-03-16T00:39:46  <McLeopold> not sure if that should be the manager or the worker that does that
2011-03-16T00:39:52  <McLeopold> submission failures
2011-03-16T00:39:57  <amstan> compile failures?
2011-03-16T00:40:02  <McLeopold> that too
2011-03-16T00:40:02  <amstan> idk if you want worker for that
2011-03-16T00:40:12  <amstan> you don't want 10 compilation failures because you have 10 workers
2011-03-16T00:40:29  <McLeopold> the worker would only do it on a compile task
2011-03-16T00:40:51  <McLeopold> the others wouldn't get the compile task, and shouldn't get the submission scheduled for a game
2011-03-16T00:41:11  <McLeopold> but still, if the manager should send emails, then that needs to be fixed
2011-03-16T00:42:40  <amstan> ok
2011-03-16T00:43:05  <amstan> i'll look on it when i get familiar with the worker and manager
2011-03-16T00:46:18  <CIA-33> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * rb4e7c66 / (3 files in 3 dirs): Removal of simplejson - http://bit.ly/fVvrNh
2011-03-16T00:47:20  <amstan> McLeopold: oh yeah.. do you still need ants/viewer?
2011-03-16T00:47:44  <McLeopold> yeah, I kinda like it for testing, but not for tools
2011-03-16T00:48:10  <amstan> McLeopold: do you need the jquery that in there? can you link it to google api?
2011-03-16T00:48:28  <McLeopold> it made it faster to test rather than pinging google every time
2011-03-16T00:48:47  <amstan> ok
2011-03-16T00:48:55  <McLeopold> if you remove it, then I'll just have the dir untracked
2011-03-16T00:50:06  <McLeopold> I'm going to attempt the merge with sigh's stuff now.
2011-03-16T00:50:14  <amstan> McLeopold: hold on

2011-03-16T00:52:01  <amstan> McLeopold: oh.. wait, so what about this then? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues#issue/13
2011-03-16T00:52:21  <McLeopold> yeah, still an issue
2011-03-16T00:52:35  <McLeopold> whoever does that should look at the cleanup of jail users as well
2011-03-16T00:52:47  <McLeopold> whoever does the jail users, that is
2011-03-16T00:53:32  <McLeopold> amstan: how do I pull the fact the epsilon-new-schema is gone?
2011-03-16T00:53:41  <amstan> McLeopold: just delete it manually
2011-03-16T00:53:46  <McLeopold> ok
2011-03-16T00:53:48  <amstan> git branch -d epsilon-new-schema
2011-03-16T00:54:18  <McLeopold> oh, how do I pull trueskill again?
2011-03-16T00:54:25  <amstan> hmm?
2011-03-16T00:54:50  <McLeopold> it's a sub-repo
2011-03-16T00:55:24  <amstan> you want to update it?
2011-03-16T00:55:30  <McLeopold> just get the files
2011-03-16T00:55:41  <amstan> Initializing the git submodules:
2011-03-16T00:55:43  <amstan> git submodule init
2011-03-16T00:55:44  <amstan> git submodule update
2011-03-16T00:55:47  <amstan> from the README
2011-03-16T00:56:42  <McLeopold> huh, no mapping for manager/trueskill
2011-03-16T00:56:55  <amstan> are you serious?
2011-03-16T00:57:10  <McLeopold> yes, for trueskill, flags c bot worked
2011-03-16T00:57:34  <McLeopold> the mapping is pointed to itself
2011-03-16T00:58:01  <McLeopold> coulda been me who did that...

2011-03-16T00:59:17  <McLeopold> :)
2011-03-16T00:59:36  <McLeopold> linus will probably tell you you're doing it wrong
2011-03-16T00:59:58  <amstan> for all i know he's probably right
2011-03-16T01:00:06  <amstan> lol
2011-03-16T01:00:14  <McLeopold> only guido is always right, :)

2011-03-16T01:03:13  <McLeopold> ok, just found it, epsilon only
2011-03-16T01:03:15  <amstan> McLeopold: apparently epsilon
2011-03-16T01:03:34  <amstan> McLeopold: if you wanna save that todo, put it in a wiki page
2011-03-16T01:03:42  <McLeopold> here goes merging hell
2011-03-16T01:03:45  <amstan> if you have more time, format them as separate issues
2011-03-16T01:03:56  <amstan> idk.. merging is supposed to be fun with git
2011-03-16T01:04:02  <amstan> it was designed to be fun
2011-03-16T01:04:11  <McLeopold> amstan: it will always be there, on etherpad, I will move them to issues
2011-03-16T01:04:20  <McLeopold> fun how?
2011-03-16T01:04:55  <McLeopold> like, it's suppose to do it well without intervention?
2011-03-16T01:05:04  <amstan> yeah, something like that

2011-03-16T01:58:50  <McLeopold> okay, make sure to pull
2011-03-16T01:58:57  <sigh> yup, will do

2011-03-16T02:03:28  <sigh> McLeopold: I'll rename __str__ and make the update that Frontier asked for
2011-03-16T02:03:29  <McLeopold> I just want your input on anything you think is left to do
2011-03-16T02:04:01  <sigh> also, there is a bug in do_spawn that _flag pointed out which is an easy fix
2011-03-16T02:04:08  <McLeopold> sigh: you too, fill in the ehterpad if you have things you think are outstanding
2011-03-16T02:04:21  <sigh> ok
2011-03-16T02:04:22  <McLeopold> I'm going to move stuff from the etherpad to issues at some point
2011-03-16T02:05:59  <sigh> tonight I will fix the replay format, fix some ordering bugs in do_spawn and do_attack as well as make it obvious that they are order independent
2011-03-16T02:06:08  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I was hoping to try perlin noise again, but I think it should be alright as is for a general map gen
2011-03-16T02:06:12  <sigh> I've done the work for the latter, just need to merge
2011-03-16T02:07:11  <sigh> if I have time, and it's not too much work, I will neaten up the incremental replay format
2011-03-16T02:07:42  <antimatroid> sigh: is the symmetric spawning do what we came up with the other day yet?
2011-03-16T02:07:46  <antimatroid> doing*
2011-03-16T02:07:55  <sigh> I haven't touched it
2011-03-16T02:08:02  <sigh> since I last talked to you
2011-03-16T02:08:38  <sigh> I'll keep that in the sym-food branch so watch that if you want
2011-03-16T02:09:03  <sigh> sym-food branch in my repo
2011-03-16T02:09:38  <CIA-33> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r5169a1a / manager/trueskill_matchups.py : Merge remote branch 'stephen-smith/trueskill-matching' into epsilon - http://bit.ly/dVIPbw
2011-03-16T02:11:40  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what kind of dimensions/no players do we want to start out with?
2011-03-16T02:11:56  <antimatroid> i think it'd best to cast a net far too wide and then reduce it
2011-03-16T02:12:00  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-16T02:12:03  <sigh> 5 dimensions with 4.3 players
2011-03-16T02:12:08  <antimatroid> :p
2011-03-16T02:12:29  <McLeopold> 2-26 players, with small, medium and large maps
2011-03-16T02:12:45  <antimatroid> give me a min/max row numbers :)
2011-03-16T02:12:59  <McLeopold> players * magic formula
2011-03-16T02:13:06  <antimatroid> okay
2011-03-16T02:13:22  <antimatroid> i need a minimum starting distance between players too
2011-03-16T02:13:36  <McLeopold> lets say a small map is each player can't see each other and has about 200 land to themselves
2011-03-16T02:14:03  <sigh> minimum starting distance = vision distance?
2011-03-16T02:14:05  <McLeopold> which would be a starting distance of around 10?
2011-03-16T02:14:19  <McLeopold> maybe a little bigger
2011-03-16T02:14:24  <sigh> +1
2011-03-16T02:14:25  <McLeopold> vision*2
2011-03-16T02:14:36  <antimatroid> why 2*vision?
2011-03-16T02:14:44  <McLeopold> so they can't see each others land at first?
2011-03-16T02:14:48  <sigh> want to control what you can see
2011-03-16T02:14:52  <sigh> i suppose
2011-03-16T02:15:20  <antimatroid> what about starting it at vision then making it larger if people are too close?
2011-03-16T02:15:26  <sigh> also with just vision you can see the symmerty immediately
2011-03-16T02:15:38  <antimatroid> sigh: not necessarily
2011-03-16T02:15:39  <McLeopold> also, green_tea argued for smaller vision, which I'm thinking might be more fun
2011-03-16T02:15:47  <antimatroid> i think it'd be less strategic
2011-03-16T02:15:51  <antimatroid> making it less fun
2011-03-16T02:16:09  <antimatroid> if you are blindly fighting ants cause you can only just see beyond your fight radius, it's a little boring
2011-03-16T02:16:13  <sigh> antimatroid: you can see 2*vision and symmetry could repeat with a period of vision
2011-03-16T02:16:32  <McLeopold> sigh: good point, I think vision*2 is a good minimum
2011-03-16T02:16:39  <antimatroid> sigh: i still thinks it's iffy working out what is symmetric
2011-03-16T02:16:50  <antimatroid> but okay
2011-03-16T02:17:07  <McLeopold> and 200x200 is a good max
2011-03-16T02:17:28  <antimatroid> can the visualiser handle 200x200 reasonably?
2011-03-16T02:17:37  <antimatroid> i think frontier estimated a realistic upper bound as lower than that
2011-03-16T02:17:40  <McLeopold> the engine speed can't
2011-03-16T02:18:01  <McLeopold> he'll need to fix that then
2011-03-16T02:18:15  <antimatroid> he made that estimate before making anything
2011-03-16T02:18:23  <antimatroid> based on the number of pixels on a standard laptop screen
2011-03-16T02:18:52  <sigh> visualiser is one of the important parts of the comp, as it draws interest... if you can't visualize it then it's no good
2011-03-16T02:19:38  <antimatroid> hence the "realistic" comment
2011-03-16T02:19:57  <antimatroid> did anything ever get done about being able to zoom in?
2011-03-16T02:19:59  <antimatroid> that would work
2011-03-16T02:20:12  <antimatroid> just start everything as a single pixel if necessary and make people zoom
2011-03-16T02:22:35  <antimatroid> ahh, i might have trouble with a magic function to pick min/max dimensions based on selected number of players
2011-03-16T02:22:39  <janzert> http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ look at these instance type, go to the pricing page, figure jeff was willing to run 3 high cpu medium instances for the majority of the contest last time, then figure out what instance(s) give you the best resources and realize what your maximum simultaneous bots you can run at once is
2011-03-16T02:22:43  <antimatroid> i use the dimensions to pick the number of players
2011-03-16T02:23:03  <janzert> all that too say I'm not sure jeff has the budget to run more than maximum of 4 player games
2011-03-16T02:23:24  <janzert> with the limiting factor being ram
2011-03-16T02:23:41  <antimatroid> we need to work out how to let bots sequentially pick their moves each turn safely
2011-03-16T02:23:59  <McLeopold> oh yeah, forgot about that
2011-03-16T02:23:59  <janzert> that doesn't help ram use though
2011-03-16T02:24:02  <antimatroid> then it really shouldn't be any different to playing a normal game ignoring enginer overhead
2011-03-16T02:24:10  <antimatroid> hmmm, true
2011-03-16T02:24:13  <sigh> was ram really a bottleneck?
2011-03-16T02:24:25  <antimatroid> sigh: ram wasn't used much for pw, it will for this
2011-03-16T02:24:33  <janzert> not in the past but it was only 2 players per game
2011-03-16T02:24:45  <antimatroid> people WILL be successfully using tree's for battles in this, and trees use memory
2011-03-16T02:25:12  <sigh> I'm not sure why it is more of an issue here than in planet wars, but ok
2011-03-16T02:25:17  <janzert> and we had problem making java even run with less than access to 2GB as well
2011-03-16T02:25:20  <sigh> (other than #players)
2011-03-16T02:25:29  <sigh> oh ok
2011-03-16T02:25:41  <antimatroid> because people weren't using memory like nothing else for their ideas
2011-03-16T02:25:41  <McLeopold> janzert: per bot, or for 2 bots
2011-03-16T02:25:54  <janzert> per jvm run
2011-03-16T02:25:55  <antimatroid> you could see on tcp that very few people used most of their time either
2011-03-16T02:26:24  <janzert> I now wonder if there aren't command line options to lower that, but I don't really know
2011-03-16T02:26:55  <antimatroid> in short, we need decent funding
2011-03-16T02:27:04  <antimatroid> we should get amazon to sponsor us with servers
2011-03-16T02:27:14  <antimatroid> unlikely but worth a shot
2011-03-16T02:27:20  <janzert> or at least find out from jeff what the budget is
2011-03-16T02:27:33  <antimatroid> it's unknown i think
2011-03-16T02:27:50  <antimatroid> he's been funneling in his own coin, which is not sustainable, and paying tax on donations he does take
2011-03-16T02:28:46  <janzert> I know google did chip in for the last contest at least, but I'm not clear on how much
2011-03-16T02:33:49  <McLeopold> janzert: when building nodejs, how do you get kqueue to be found?  I installed the kqueue-dev package, but no luck
2011-03-16T02:34:59  <janzert> one other note, if ram is the limiting factor in number of bots for a game, then in general for a worker to maximize its resource use it should run one game at a time with the engine running bots in a mix of simultaneous and sequential execution

2011-03-16T02:36:48  <janzert> specifically the install_nodjs function
2011-03-16T02:37:03  <McLeopold> janzert: apparently kqueue is bsd only, so I'm left with event.h and port.h not being found.
2011-03-16T02:37:28  <janzert> it just does ./configure; make; make install basically though
2011-03-16T02:38:20  <janzert> hmm, that sounds like configure got something wrong somehow
2011-03-16T02:38:42  <janzert> I think for linux it should be using select or epoll or similiar
2011-03-16T02:39:06  <McLeopold> ok, it doesn't need them, but I kinda want to know why

2011-03-16T02:41:31  <janzert> because linux generally uses a different event notification method, e.g. select or epoll
2011-03-16T02:42:24  <janzert> but I really know fairly little about any of them so...
2011-03-16T02:46:23  <janzert> I do remember when kqueue was first introduced into freebsd though :P

2011-03-16T07:53:25  <Naktibalda> now it's a Spring 2011
2011-03-16T07:54:55  <olex> spring-summer would be great
2011-03-16T07:55:00  <needsch> not yet: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge => "This code will provide the basis for the next contest (Winter 2011)." ;)
2011-03-16T07:56:23  <aerique> it is winter now though? :)
2011-03-16T07:56:38  <stocha> is it not spring ?
2011-03-16T07:56:46  <aerique> 5 more days?
2011-03-16T07:56:54  <stocha> oh
2011-03-16T07:57:28  <aerique> well, unless you're in the southern hemisphere
2011-03-16T07:57:30  <stocha> if i want to post a sample code, can i do that on the forum ?
2011-03-16T07:57:51  <stocha> or is there a standard way to do that.
2011-03-16T07:58:05  <sigh> sample code of what?
2011-03-16T07:58:24  <stocha> i just want to post the random walk map generation code.
2011-03-16T07:58:51  <stocha> it's straight forward
2011-03-16T07:58:59  <stocha> a few lines.
2011-03-16T07:59:12  <sigh> oh anywhere should be fine... although ideally you would fork the project on github :)
2011-03-16T07:59:21  <stocha> a bit more to include tha bitMap object
2011-03-16T07:59:29  <stocha> it's java.
2011-03-16T07:59:36  <stocha> most github is not java :p
2011-03-16T08:00:09  <stocha> anyway i never used github yet,
2011-03-16T08:00:22  <stocha> and maybe it is less visible ?
2011-03-16T08:00:29  <needsch> when do you expect "Epsilon" to start?
2011-03-16T08:00:59  <stocha> [12:50] <Naktibalda> now it's a Spring 2011
2011-03-16T08:01:42  <Naktibalda> in 2-3 weeks probably
2011-03-16T08:01:50  <stocha> this soon ?
2011-03-16T08:02:04  <stocha> specification are not very clear to me right now :p
2011-03-16T08:02:42  <stocha> for the ant game i mean.
2011-03-16T08:03:15  <sigh> amstan said he's aiming for Fri + 2 weeks but probably wont happen
2011-03-16T08:04:19  <sigh> stocha: definitely bring up any ambiguities you see in the specs... I know that some of the food generation and battle resolution aren't completely sorted out
2011-03-16T08:04:21  <stocha> souldn't there be some beta testing before oppening the challenge ?
2011-03-16T08:04:48  <sigh> there is sort of at the moment, from people who frequent the channel :P
2011-03-16T08:05:00  <sigh> but it is still in dev
2011-03-16T08:05:05  <stocha> Well :  combat resolution i do not see the why of the two propositions :p i think it needs intense beta testing :p
2011-03-16T08:05:14  <stocha> food generation : i think it needs intense beta testing
2011-03-16T08:05:30  <stocha> map generation : i think it really needs some more prototyping /beta testing :p
2011-03-16T08:05:50  <stocha> starting position : i think it needs some prototyping, /beta testing

2011-03-16T08:07:01  <sigh> if you see a lot of issues, it's probably best to make a post on the forum
2011-03-16T08:07:02  <stocha> I think you need an ubuntu machine to do some testing ?
2011-03-16T08:07:13  <stocha> well i did post messages.
2011-03-16T08:07:22  <stocha> maybe not in the right places though, but well.
2011-03-16T08:07:40  <stocha> are you in involved in the release sigh ?
2011-03-16T08:07:42  <sigh> no, it's run on windows and osx just fine
2011-03-16T08:07:55  <stocha> i got osx on this laptop.
2011-03-16T08:08:03  <stocha> so i guess i should have some testing then :p
2011-03-16T08:08:10  <aerique> stocha: don't forget that the weeks of the challenge before the final ranking battle are also used to tweak settings
2011-03-16T08:08:16  <stocha> i can always explain why i couldn't do it :p
2011-03-16T08:08:20  <sigh> stocha: I'm doing a bit of dev in the backend here and there, but I haven't really been involved a huge deal in the game specs
2011-03-16T08:08:26  <sigh> mostly for lack of time
2011-03-16T08:08:58  <stocha> i think the previous two games where already beaten down. Because a lot of peoples already played them (humans)
2011-03-16T08:09:02  <stocha> and specs where
2011-03-16T08:09:15  <stocha> and speces about games mecanics where kinda of setled.
2011-03-16T08:09:27  <sigh> yeah, I agree
2011-03-16T08:09:29  <stocha> although i didn't try to figure it out to hard.
2011-03-16T08:09:43  <stocha> so here you have a whole new process of making up a great challenge.
2011-03-16T08:10:05  <stocha> I think that make "beta testing" really important part of setting up the challenge.
2011-03-16T08:10:30  <stocha> and so i don't see point in the whole complexity of the current propositions.
2011-03-16T08:10:31  <sigh> yup
2011-03-16T08:10:43  <stocha> both for combat and map generation (and food generation also)
2011-03-16T08:10:48  <sigh> i agree to some extent
2011-03-16T08:11:18  <sigh> some of it is in an effort to be symmetrical and fair
2011-03-16T08:11:20  <stocha> maybe there are plans already and i just don't know of them ?
2011-03-16T08:11:31  <stocha> but then 2 weeks seems realy short !
2011-03-16T08:11:43  <stocha> unless it the eta before beta testing :p
2011-03-16T08:12:21  <stocha> I would have posted some more on the forum you know, but i'm really uncomfortable with it
2011-03-16T08:12:29  <stocha> especially since i'm so green here :p
2011-03-16T08:12:42  <stocha> i guess it's not for me to do that.
2011-03-16T08:12:54  <badgerhunt2> anyone: I've forked and created a scala starter pack. How do I test it? Do I need to build the ubuntu vm? Or is there a ready made exec zip like with planetwars?
2011-03-16T08:13:01  <sigh> stocha: not to worry :)
2011-03-16T08:13:28  <sigh> although, I'm not the best person to talk to about the big picture stuff
2011-03-16T08:13:39  <stocha> do you know if there are plans for a tcp server where bot can be run on home machines and only the server is hosted by some volunteers ?
2011-03-16T08:14:05  <stocha> Irc is good and all, but you need to be there at the right time. That seems impractical
2011-03-16T08:14:05  <sigh> stocha: definitely, there will be one
2011-03-16T08:14:31  <stocha> although reading the forum i understand that a lot was deciding upon on irc.
2011-03-16T08:14:44  <sigh> yeah, that's true
2011-03-16T08:15:10  <stocha> will it be an official tcp server, or will it be after the launch that some folk will set up one ?
2011-03-16T08:15:18  <stocha> will it be used for testing the rules ?
2011-03-16T08:15:52  <sigh> hopefully an official one, but again I haven't been listening in on the big picture stuff
2011-03-16T08:16:05  <stocha> Are all the core team in the same university ? physically all in the same place.
2011-03-16T08:16:42  <sigh> the admins - ie people with root access to the servers, yes, or at least in the same area
2011-03-16T08:16:43  <stocha> I wouldn't like to open a thread about it, and find out it's common knowledge, or you just need to dig a bit to get the picture.
2011-03-16T08:17:00  <sigh> but there are a lot more people helping out than that
2011-03-16T08:17:23  <stocha> yet decisions where made on irc. Is there an official time for gathering ?
2011-03-16T08:18:20  <sigh> evening in the us timezones is when it's most active, but I'm at work at that time so I don't really know
2011-03-16T08:18:34  <sigh> I don't pay attention much to the forums either
2011-03-16T08:18:42  <sigh> I just got roped into doing some code ^_^
2011-03-16T08:18:57  <stocha> what are you working on ?
2011-03-16T08:19:05  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!kvirc@88-214-93-86.dialup.umc.net.ua> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-16T08:19:22  <sigh> just some bug fixes, new replay format, tidying up code
2011-03-16T08:19:25  <aerique> badgerhunt2: so far i've tested my starter bot only by pasting it info from https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ant-bot-input-output on stdin
2011-03-16T08:19:32  <sigh> engine backend stuff
2011-03-16T08:20:03  <aerique> badgerhunt2: maybe there's a working local engine now in the repo, but there wasn't a couple of weeks ago
2011-03-16T08:21:00  <aerique> stocha: don't hesitate to post on the forums, nothing to be uncomfortable about
2011-03-16T08:21:16  <stocha> it's hard to find the right place for the stuff i want to discuss
2011-03-16T08:21:30  <stocha> also i'm affraid it could be offending for the already done stuff
2011-03-16T08:21:35  <aerique> stocha: yeah, they still need to setup the forums for the current challenge
2011-03-16T08:21:58  <stocha> like there is already a map generator of some sort, and i would like to just discuss how map generating should be done and tested uppon :p
2011-03-16T08:22:00  <Frontier> there was a lot of talk going on in the last hours. so the replays will be stored in a file system with folder name = game_id / 10,000
2011-03-16T08:22:03  <aerique> stocha: nah, don't worry about offending someone, just ignore those people
2011-03-16T08:22:32  <Frontier> antimatroid wants the zoom implemented
2011-03-16T08:22:48  <stocha> well, everyone is working for free. And i'm new to this. I don't want to detter some energy from the one doing the hard work.
2011-03-16T08:22:48  <sigh> stocha: oh yes, if you want to talk about map generation talk to antimatroid
2011-03-16T08:23:18  <stocha> should i send a private message on the forum to him then ?
2011-03-16T08:23:18  <sigh> and don't worry about offending him
2011-03-16T08:23:41  <aerique> stocha: public would be better, some other people might be interested and have info as well
2011-03-16T08:23:44  <sigh> it would better to keep conversations in public
2011-03-16T08:24:14  <badgerhunt2> aerique: tyvm - i can use the bot input in a unit test, substituing std.in for another stream. that will work well.
2011-03-16T08:24:16  <sigh> if you are posting on the forum then just post to everyone
2011-03-16T08:24:40  <sigh> but antimatroid is the one who cares most about map generation :P
2011-03-16T08:24:49  <stocha> okay. i should have oppenned a new thread i guess. Stocha ideas or something :p
2011-03-16T08:24:51  <sigh> he's usually here around this him, not sure where he is right now
2011-03-16T08:25:17  <stocha> he is at the university too ?
2011-03-16T08:25:21  *** badgerhunt2 <badgerhunt2!~badgerhun@60-242-43-113.static.tpgi.com.au> has quit IRC ()
2011-03-16T08:25:26  <sigh> yeah, but in australia
2011-03-16T08:25:35  <aerique> badgerhunt2: i have some beginnings of a game engine if you're on linux but it's far from complete and might be more of a hassle than a help
2011-03-16T08:25:53  <sigh> oh he's at university, not at *the* university
2011-03-16T08:26:02  <stocha> okay :)
2011-03-16T08:26:03  <aerique> badgerhunt: but it might help with some input and output problems
2011-03-16T08:27:16  <stocha> we'll se how my post got responded too then and in few days i might try to open a new thread to talk about how to beta test the rules in order to tune them toward simplicity and enlightened enineering choices :p
2011-03-16T08:27:29  <stocha> thanks sigh.
2011-03-16T08:28:59  <aerique> Ugh: "Information about a water square will only be sent the first turn in which it is visible by one of your live ants.", what a hassle to keep track of.
2011-03-16T08:29:24  <aerique> (on the engine side, i mean)
2011-03-16T08:29:42  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@150.254.83.99> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-16T08:29:51  <stocha> i wondered about that too aerique
2011-03-16T08:30:02  <stocha> maybe they want to make bandwith optimization ?
2011-03-16T08:30:14  <aerique> yes, i assume so
2011-03-16T08:30:15  <stocha> it could be that there will be a lot of water seeing indeed.
2011-03-16T08:30:57  <stocha> still a hassle but well.
2011-03-16T08:31:07  <aerique> i'm going to ignore that spec for now :)
2011-03-16T08:31:10  <stocha> someone talked about stateless desirability
2011-03-16T08:33:14  *** badgerhunt <badgerhunt!badgerhunt@60-242-43-113.static.tpgi.com.au> has quit IRC ()
2011-03-16T08:34:14  <Frontier> so who wants me to visualize 200x200 maps Oo ?
2011-03-16T08:35:18  <stocha> what map size should we expect for the tournament ?
2011-03-16T08:35:32  <Frontier> Yesterday I tried to beat HunterBot and I failed -.-. It took 500 turns until I finally lost.
2011-03-16T08:35:46  <stocha> with a bot, or by hand ?
2011-03-16T08:35:52  <aerique> Frontier: what are you using to play a game?
2011-03-16T08:36:32  <Frontier> with a bot... uh... it's not like I am already getting a head start. Honestly ^^. I need to test the visualizer
2011-03-16T08:36:41  <stocha> is there an easy to show up a game on the forum ? i think now it's done with .gif.
2011-03-16T08:37:03  <stocha> Fontier : but you had a server also, where did you find it ?
2011-03-16T08:37:21  <stocha> i juste saw someone complaining he couldn't test is starting package.
2011-03-16T08:37:28  <aerique> Frontier: it's not about you getting a head start for me, i just want to test my starter bot
2011-03-16T08:37:48  <Frontier> stocha: There is some work in progress here, but don't rely on that link: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer.php?game_id=1#visualizer
2011-03-16T08:38:32  <stocha> it gives me a blank page ?
2011-03-16T08:38:50  <stocha> Loading visualizer... - 	java  	undefined  	(Display method: HTML Canvas [autodetected]) - 	data_dir  	visualizer/  	(Image directory) - 	codebase  	visualizer/java/  	(Java codebase) - 	game_id  	1  	 Reading replay passed in from php... Creating canvas... Parsing the replay..
2011-03-16T08:38:58  <stocha> nothing happens really.
2011-03-16T08:39:02  <Frontier> Ok there is a file called offline.html in the repo. So if you check out the git repo you get some offline tool to watch replays. The engine is there too.
2011-03-16T08:39:38  <stocha> So there is an engine there for generating the output of the game, and then you can visualize them with offline.html ?
2011-03-16T08:39:40  <Frontier> stocha: what browser? maybe i am missing something
2011-03-16T08:40:01  <stocha> i think it's called safari.
2011-03-16T08:40:21  <Frontier> stocha: that's what I do, yes. But there has been a change to the replay format a few hours ago. I am yet to update the visualizer.
2011-03-16T08:40:40  <Frontier> stocha: Ah ok, I haven't checked Safari last time
2011-03-16T08:40:49  <stocha> what change ? how do i see that kind of change ? Are the specs gitted too ?
2011-03-16T08:40:56  <Frontier> (running it under wine on linux ^^)
2011-03-16T08:41:06  <stocha> i had no problem wiewing the planet wars stuff though.
2011-03-16T08:41:37  <Frontier> stocha: I concerns only the replay format, so your bot is unaffected. I will update the Wiki page about that as soon as I see it working
2011-03-16T08:42:07  <stocha> but how do you know of the change in the first place. How did it happened ?
2011-03-16T08:42:21  <stocha> and why.
2011-03-16T08:42:37  <stocha> i'm currious to understand what's going on :p
2011-03-16T08:42:37  <Frontier> stocha: It works for me in Safari, what is your browser version?
2011-03-16T08:42:43  <stocha> what the workflow is.
2011-03-16T08:42:51  <stocha> i'll try to get more information.
2011-03-16T08:43:08  <stocha> Version 5.0.3 (6533.19.4)
2011-03-16T08:43:20  <stocha> it's a french system base installation.
2011-03-16T08:43:56  <Frontier> Well I realized that on the last turn the visualizer cannot determine if an ant survives the game or dies in the last turn, as we just store the orders a bot issued. and in end game state there are obviously no more orders
2011-03-16T08:44:26  <stocha> ?
2011-03-16T08:44:39  <Frontier> so I asked sigh to add some information for me that i can use to either keep or kill any ant in the last turn
2011-03-16T08:45:01  <Frontier> we now append an * to each command string if the ant survives the game
2011-03-16T08:45:04  <stocha> is not the last turn all staying in place ?
2011-03-16T08:45:24  <stocha> oh i probably misunderstood anyway :p
2011-03-16T08:45:53  <stocha> the command are from the server not the client then ?
2011-03-16T08:45:57  <Frontier> if the game was played over 2 turns you have turn 0 and turn 1 where orders can be issued. then there is turn 2 which just displays the end result and isn't really played back
2011-03-16T08:46:32  <Frontier> in turn 2 there are no orders from any ant (not even 'do nothing'), so i would consider them dead
2011-03-16T08:46:36  <stocha> so it's like every player issues no command for their ants.
2011-03-16T08:47:01  <stocha> okay, so you need the do nothing to get it right :p
2011-03-16T08:47:02  <Frontier> stocha: Even more like 'the ants don't exist any more'
2011-03-16T08:47:09  <Frontier> correct :)
2011-03-16T08:47:25  <stocha> okay :)
2011-03-16T08:48:12  <Frontier> still I'm wondering what happens in Safari. Can you look into the error console and check for any messages printed in red? ^^
2011-03-16T08:48:47  <stocha> i'll try. where is the error console ? :p
2011-03-16T08:49:39  <stocha> i found no error console
2011-03-16T08:49:49  <aerique> man, i really need to start using row-col instead of x-y
2011-03-16T08:50:14  <Frontier> i think you have to enable the developer menu first
2011-03-16T08:50:21  <stocha> how do i do that ?
2011-03-16T08:50:48  <stocha> found it
2011-03-16T08:51:16  <stocha> marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer/js/Buttons.js:80INDEX_SIZE_ERR: DOM Exception 1: Index or size was negative, or greater than the allowed value.
2011-03-16T08:51:39  <Frontier> what is your safari version? 5.0?
2011-03-16T08:52:23  <stocha> 5.0.3 i posted it earlier :p
2011-03-16T08:53:36  <stocha> interesting enough : if i activate the "suivi des ressources" thingy, i can see some ant game running :p
2011-03-16T08:53:44  <Frontier> oh sorry, i was typing while you wrote that
2011-03-16T08:54:59  <stocha> what's the map size ?
2011-03-16T08:55:09  <Frontier> 80x60 roughly
2011-03-16T08:55:11  <stocha> how do one post a game on the forum with your visualizer ? :p
2011-03-16T08:55:54  <Frontier> You cannot do much anything than posting the .replay file
2011-03-16T08:56:12  <Frontier> desolé, pas de .gif
2011-03-16T08:56:32  <stocha> okay. then people will have to put it into their visualizeur
2011-03-16T08:57:29  <Frontier> yes that is the only way.
2011-03-16T08:57:39  <stocha> http://emergent.unpythonic.net/software/01126462511-glif
2011-03-16T08:57:40  <Frontier> the line safari complained about was: ctx.drawImage(g.img, this.offset, 0, bs, bs, g.border, g.border + dy, bs, bs);
2011-03-16T08:57:51  <stocha> i now nothing about java script, so i can't check if it's worth it :p
2011-03-16T08:58:05  <stocha> is it ?
2011-03-16T08:58:12  <stocha> do you see a but there ?
2011-03-16T08:58:15  <stocha> bug
2011-03-16T08:59:55  <aerique> with random food placement one can get chain reactions of ants spawning if multiple food tiles are within spawn distance of eachother
2011-03-16T08:59:58  <stocha> i'll go back to my work
2011-03-16T08:59:59  <Frontier> The error message means while trying to draw an image the coordinates went out of the image boundaries. The image was smaller than expected
2011-03-16T09:00:35  <stocha> aerique : can new ant spawn food on their birth turn ?
2011-03-16T09:00:57  <Frontier> stocha: And since you don't have any cached old images I really can't make a rhyme out of that.
2011-03-16T09:01:16  <stocha> okay.
2011-03-16T09:01:53  <aerique> stocha: i haven't been able to find when exactly food is spawned during a turn
2011-03-16T09:02:06  <stocha> the strange thing is that now that the developper menu is on, it seems to work frontier
2011-03-16T09:02:24  <stocha> and when ant are spawn also
2011-03-16T09:03:01  <aerique> stocha: no, that's in the "Game State Update" here
2011-03-16T09:03:07  <aerique> stocha: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-16T09:03:41  <Frontier> I don't think that is the cause. It might just be the internet connection. On the first load the images take some time to load. Maybe I was using them too early and their size was 0 or something. It is hard to check this kind of stuff locally. Planet Wars did not use any graphics
2011-03-16T09:04:25  <Frontier> (I do have code that waits until all images are loaded, but maybe it is broken somewhere)

2011-03-16T09:05:45  <stocha> you are right aerique, they forgot the food spawn i guess. It would be at the end of the turn.
2011-03-16T09:06:10  <stocha> you don't want to spawn food before food is consumed is suppose.
2011-03-16T09:09:28  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@pb-d-128-141-236-17.cern.ch> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2011-03-16T09:14:11  <aerique> i don't know, i was mostly thinking about the random placement of food, i'm seeing clumps of food with good chain reaction potential with a local experiment
2011-03-16T09:14:15  <aerique> could be fun though
2011-03-16T09:15:16  <aerique> but the game would devolve into a race for the food clumps if we'd only have maps with random food placement i think
2011-03-16T09:15:20  <stocha> a chain reaction is when an ant pop out of a food, and then make another one pop out of an other food without a turn passing right ?
2011-03-16T09:15:37  <aerique> no, i meant with one turn passing
2011-03-16T09:16:01  <stocha> you are talking about no food spawning between turn then ?
2011-03-16T09:16:19  <aerique> stocha: see https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Food-Spawning
2011-03-16T09:16:37  <aerique> stocha: i don't understand your last statement
2011-03-16T09:17:55  <stocha> so let's say we start with a map empty of food ... :p
2011-03-16T09:18:23  <stocha> you are interested in when some food would colonize some part of the map somehow and now an ant arrive ?
2011-03-16T09:18:42  <stocha> so the ant will begin to multiply at an exponential rate
2011-03-16T09:19:16  <aerique> yes, sorta. depending on how much food is close together
2011-03-16T09:19:22  <stocha> but as i understand it, it's supposed to only be ONE food per turn. So if bots are very active, it could hardly be many food accumulating.
2011-03-16T09:19:56  <aerique> okey, i must have missed that :)  then there is no problem
2011-03-16T09:20:27  <stocha> it all comes to the speed of spawning food
2011-03-16T09:20:42  <stocha> but then, how would chain gathering food be a problem ?
2011-03-16T09:21:00  <stocha> is it not the same as food behing splited all over the map and gathered in  a few turn ?
2011-03-16T09:21:05  <stocha> then net + ant is the same.
2011-03-16T09:21:18  <stocha> so it all comes down to how many food per turn/ game are generated.
2011-03-16T09:21:36  <stocha> aka planet regeneration :p
2011-03-16T09:22:07  <stocha> But then i don't understand all this need to try to make it fair, when we have so few test to back up engineering choices.
2011-03-16T09:22:36  <stocha> their can t be more ant than there is ground though. so really i can not be a problem
2011-03-16T09:22:51  <stocha> if ants are everywhere, there won't be food spawning anymore :p
2011-03-16T09:23:00  <aerique> the net +ant will be the same, but it will be mostly ants of one player :)
2011-03-16T09:23:44  <stocha> if it's perfectly random, then on average, the player will gain as many regeneration as he is farming ground.
2011-03-16T09:23:54  <stocha> wich is probably "fair".
2011-03-16T09:24:34  <aerique> we'll see :)
2011-03-16T09:24:37  <stocha> the bigger the map, the fairer it is i guess.
2011-03-16T09:25:04  <stocha> also you need enough ant before encountering others for it to be fair. but well.
2011-03-16T09:25:04  <aerique> i'm not necessarily against it, but it's good to keep in mind
2011-03-16T09:25:30  <stocha> sure. we need to test all the simplest rules, in order to decide how "fun" they are.
2011-03-16T09:25:41  <stocha> still there are a lot of complex proposition right now.
2011-03-16T09:25:55  <stocha> in map generation, food generation, combat solving.
2011-03-16T09:26:05  <aerique> and the game has already been simplified from an initial proposal :)
2011-03-16T09:26:47  <stocha> for people to be able to get right into it, it really has to be dead simple. But with complex behaviors then
2011-03-16T09:26:50  <stocha> alike the game of go :)
2011-03-16T09:27:10  <stocha> if you have very complex rules, and obvious optimal strategy it's a loss :p
2011-03-16T09:27:33  <stocha> so you have to take some time figuring out how complex the perfect strategy seems to be.
2011-03-16T09:27:43  <stocha> or how obvious.
2011-03-16T09:28:08  <stocha> then you want the game to be fun to watch, but it's all hard to get right by mere imagination.
2011-03-16T09:28:47  <stocha> so i don't get this "here is what the rule should be like + 10 lines of rules there". Without displaying some demos or something.
2011-03-16T09:29:53  <stocha> somemone said : if it's too complex to solve with my mind, then it's not simple enough :p

2011-03-16T12:19:45  <amstan> you don't want any stupid html file to read files on your hd and send them over to a server

2011-03-16T12:20:29  <Frontier> amstan: I'm just reading pixels of a canvas
2011-03-16T12:20:36  <amstan> oh
2011-03-16T12:21:38  <amstan> also, at the end, the fog of war covers everything
2011-03-16T12:21:41  <Frontier> sure, I could have loaded C:\Users\amstan\pics\knownname.jpg rendered that into a canvas, read out the pixel data and used ajax to send it to my secret server - but hey. then the ajax connection should fail, not reading the pixels ^^
2011-03-16T12:22:08  <Frontier> amstan: That is part of the change that comes with the new engine in sigh/replay
2011-03-16T12:22:19  <amstan> Frontier: no.. because connecting to the internet is much more useful than reading some stupid file of the person's hd
2011-03-16T12:23:16  <McLeopold> Frontier: what change from sigh?
2011-03-16T12:24:33  <McLeopold> So, some thoughts, the wood frame is ugly, the ants' movement should be smooth and continuous, there should be some controls and clicking on the timeline (which I assume is in the works.)
2011-03-16T12:24:41  <Frontier> The ant's command strings will end in '*' if they survive the game. So I know which ants to keep in the 'end turn'.
2011-03-16T12:25:03  <McLeopold> Oh, hell no, that will not be the case.
2011-03-16T12:25:26  <McLeopold> There will be an end turn variable for the replay format, not a '*'
2011-03-16T12:25:37  <Frontier> McLeopold: antimatroid asked for a frame, but the current one is arguably ugly, yes. i wanted it to look like a sandbox
2011-03-16T12:26:06  <McLeopold> I'd rather not have a frame, but a drawning of the other side of the map
2011-03-16T12:26:14  <Frontier> McLeopold: either way I need to know if the ants actually die in the last turn or survive
2011-03-16T12:26:19  <McLeopold> plus scrolling
2011-03-16T12:27:09  <McLeopold> how about the ant line's "lastTurn" is something like -1 or undefined?
2011-03-16T12:27:40  <Frontier> That is what I want for the zoom mode in any case. Currently I'm wasting a lot of room, that's a fact. On the other hand it saves processing power and may be confusing when the board repeats several times
2011-03-16T12:28:17  <McLeopold> you can just colorize the part that is not repeated, I don't think it will be confusing
2011-03-16T12:29:42  <McLeopold> Frontier: are you okay with -1 for the last turn of an ant?
2011-03-16T12:29:51  <Frontier> but still it will be a lot slower to render all the small squares. It would be better than this frame, but I'm not sure about the performance impact
2011-03-16T12:30:08  <McLeopold> At least make it an option
2011-03-16T12:30:17  <Frontier> McLeopold: sigh and me already implemented it the other way.
2011-03-16T12:30:43  <McLeopold> Frontier: no, we need to change it
2011-03-16T12:31:31  <Frontier> Ok, but why? I don't see the format being used anywhere else but in the engine's output and the visualizer
2011-03-16T12:33:01  <McLeopold> It's redundant info, '*' is used as food in char maps, other will want to make tools, so we ought to do good design from the start.
2011-03-16T12:34:08  <Frontier> well, we omitted the 'last turn' field for the ants, so it is not redundant
2011-03-16T12:34:31  <McLeopold> You might convince me otherwise, but my first reaction to it is "eww".
2011-03-16T12:35:48  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-03-16T12:36:23  <Frontier> My intention was to make it easy for sigh to implement ^^.
2011-03-16T12:36:40  <McLeopold> how about a '!' at the end if an ant dies?
2011-03-16T12:37:06  <McLeopold> blah, I still don't like it
2011-03-16T12:37:43  <Frontier> It is still the same, just no reuse of *
2011-03-16T12:39:03  <Frontier> From the parser point of view I have to wait for all imput anyway and handle deaths at the end. The reason is that food may die or be converted. That is only clear from the appearance of a corresponding ant line.
2011-03-16T12:39:36  <McLeopold> Yeah, I can see that as I'm thinking about it.
2011-03-16T12:40:26  <McLeopold> And you do something different if the food disappears rather than become an ant?
2011-03-16T12:41:01  <Frontier> Sure, stuff that dies becomes black and shrinks, food that is converted to an ant just fades the color to the player color
2011-03-16T12:41:44  <McLeopold> so, do you have a food disappear character in the spec now?
2011-03-16T12:41:48  <Frontier> The animation isn't smooth, because it is otherwise difficult to keep track of the kills and food conversions.
2011-03-16T12:42:02  <Frontier> no food has a life time or not
2011-03-16T12:42:15  <McLeopold> ?
2011-03-16T12:42:31  <Frontier> If the foods end turn is undefined it survives the game, otherwise it is converted/killed
2011-03-16T12:42:56  <McLeopold> do you want to know the different between converted/killed?  I would think so
2011-03-16T12:43:23  <Frontier> McLeopold... i'm thinking about merging food/ant lines
2011-03-16T12:43:47  <McLeopold> Yeah, that does make some sense
2011-03-16T12:44:02  <Frontier> <row> <col> <start> |* possible cut here *| <conversion time> <player> <commands> ...
2011-03-16T12:44:26  <Frontier> but that doesn't solve it yet
2011-03-16T12:45:06  <Frontier> maybe if food that dies has a conversion time, but playerId = -1 or something
2011-03-16T12:45:46  <Frontier> You would set the end time for an ant that survives to -1 ?
2011-03-16T12:48:49  <McLeopold> I'm thinking...
2011-03-16T12:48:57  <Frontier> i see ^^

2011-03-16T15:12:31  <Frontier> there seems to be only one way to use the visualizer offline in Chrome. One has to pass it the --allow-file-access-from-files command-line argument. That is pretty annoying.
2011-03-16T15:13:24  <antimatroid> i will have no bad talk of chrome :P
2011-03-16T15:14:04  <McLeopold> Frontier: I got the local file to work with a file input tag
2011-03-16T15:15:37  <Frontier> McLeopold: JavaScript is allowed to access files using the file input tag, but it is not allowed to read the pixel data of images, because each file:// url has a different origin by design
2011-03-16T15:16:25  <McLeopold> why do you need pixel data?
2011-03-16T15:16:43  <McLeopold> I thought you just needed the replay text?
2011-03-16T15:17:04  <Frontier> I don't want to colorize 26 button images for fog and maybe other stuff.
2011-03-16T15:17:33  <Frontier> I just use a 48x48 png and colorize it for as many players as are in the replay file.
2011-03-16T15:18:20  <Frontier> In FireFox you can ask the user to allow that access.
2011-03-16T15:18:35  <McLeopold> http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/file/dndfiles/ try the third example, png files load in chrome for me
2011-03-16T15:18:52  <McLeopold> But, it may not be supported in all browsers yet.
2011-03-16T15:19:10  <Frontier> opera doesn't care about security at all and Safari is still to be tested.
2011-03-16T15:22:05  <Frontier> McLeopold: I can load files and I can read their binary data, probably. But I need a decoded png and I need it without the user browsing for the button gfx in the file explorer
2011-03-16T15:22:35  <McLeopold> I see
2011-03-16T15:22:42  <Frontier> i dont want to write a png decoder in javascript, you know?

2011-03-16T15:27:15  <Frontier> i guess I'll just have to ignore Chrome for now. :(

2011-03-16T16:48:14  <McLeopold> sure
2011-03-16T16:48:27  <amstan> Frontier: on which part?
2011-03-16T16:48:32  <McLeopold> when a game is finished, a replay file will exist on the main website
2011-03-16T16:48:35  <amstan> Frontier: apparently replays are stored in files, in a games folder
2011-03-16T16:48:48  <McLeopold> so, we need a php page that will take a game_id parameter, and load up the viewer
2011-03-16T16:49:09  <Frontier> I read: from the directory where visualizer.html is, I go into ./website/games/<id / 10.000>/<id>.replay
2011-03-16T16:49:21  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-16T16:49:35  <Frontier> McLeopold: The cool thing is: we need no php!

2011-03-16T16:53:35  <Frontier> I was not sure if you meant 'id modulo 10,000' or just a division
2011-03-16T16:53:43  <McLeopold> integer division
2011-03-16T16:53:46  <amstan> Frontier: integer division
2011-03-16T16:54:03  <McLeopold> or, drop 4 digits on the right
2011-03-16T16:54:04  <amstan> Frontier: 43243 -> 43/43243.replay
2011-03-16T16:54:12  <McLeopold> 4 digits!
2011-03-16T16:54:21  <amstan> oh.. 10000, 4/43242.replay
2011-03-16T16:54:26  <McLeopold> :)
2011-03-16T16:54:55  <Frontier> this is really a performance issue. should i cut off parts of the string or use divide and floor ^^

2011-03-16T16:55:35  <amstan> isn't there an int div?

2011-03-16T16:55:41  <Frontier> lol no
2011-03-16T16:55:46  <McLeopold> javascript only has floats
2011-03-16T16:55:52  <Frontier> they use double precision for everything
2011-03-16T16:56:00  <amstan> so what's wrong with divide then floor?
2011-03-16T16:56:09  <Frontier> nothing
2011-03-16T16:56:28  <McLeopold> why bother, he gets a string to begin with, then must translate the number to a string at the end?
2011-03-16T16:56:32  <Frontier> actually i prefer: (game_id / 10000) | 0
2011-03-16T16:56:57  <amstan> huh?
2011-03-16T16:57:10  <amstan> |0?
2011-03-16T16:57:19  <amstan> McLeopold: you're right
2011-03-16T16:57:28  <McLeopold> that calls an internal int function which chops the decimals off

2011-03-16T18:44:41  <McLeopold> sigh: 10 was a hard coded distance value.  I was looking for everything range 1, then removing it, then continuing up until 10
2011-03-16T18:44:59  <McLeopold> I though I changed that to use the game options, but I must have merged it away

2011-03-16T18:47:27  <sigh> imo, the battle resolutions specs should be sorted out as a matter of priority

2011-03-16T18:47:50  <sigh> I have? o_O
2011-03-16T18:48:41  <sigh> part of the reason I use loc everywhere rather than row, col is to avoid that mistake
2011-03-16T18:49:11  <McLeopold> could be my refactor, still looking
2011-03-16T18:53:55  <McLeopold> nope, it was just coincidental data
2011-03-16T18:56:04  <janzert> I think we should just go with the option 2 battle resolution and see if Jeff even remembers/notices it when he comes back :P

2011-03-16T19:17:07  <McLeopold> janzert: do you see any issue in limiting the pool of available players to those not in a waiting matchup?
2011-03-16T19:18:51  <janzert> it becomes a problem when the ratio of active players to games per minute is low
2011-03-16T19:19:09  <janzert> so during the general contest no it isn't a problem
2011-03-16T19:19:28  <janzert> during the finals when trying to limit play to the top few players it became a problem
2011-03-16T19:19:56  <McLeopold> how many matchups were in the queue?
2011-03-16T19:20:12  <janzert> about 3-5 minutes worth
2011-03-16T19:20:28  <McLeopold> which includes what percent of players left?
2011-03-16T19:20:48  <janzert> it was up to 75%
2011-03-16T19:20:57  <McLeopold> yeah, that would hurt it
2011-03-16T19:20:59  <janzert> roughly
2011-03-16T19:21:14  <McLeopold> you don't play bots on the other side of the rotation
2011-03-16T19:21:24  * janzert nods
2011-03-16T19:21:42  <McLeopold> if I can make this so a matchup is created only when requested, I don't think it would be a problem
2011-03-16T19:21:54  <janzert> it's the reason the cutoff ended up staying at 1000
2011-03-16T19:22:11  <janzert> without fixing that I couldn't lower it any farther
2011-03-16T19:22:21  <janzert> and I didn't have any time to fix it :/
2011-03-16T19:22:51  <McLeopold> I may just remove seed players then
2011-03-16T19:23:13  <McLeopold> from being selected as seed players
2011-03-16T19:24:04  <janzert> or take all the players in the queue and order them at the end of the seed list (in the order their game is in the queue)
2011-03-16T19:24:15  <janzert> I think that is really the right way to do it
2011-03-16T19:24:38  <janzert> of course it's also more complex
2011-03-16T19:24:42  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-03-16T19:24:54  <McLeopold> but if we can always produce a list of all users, then it always works
2011-03-16T19:25:07  <McLeopold> just mess with the ordering
2011-03-16T19:25:20  <janzert> yep
2011-03-16T19:26:26  <janzert> one other thing regarding the game queue
2011-03-16T19:27:24  <janzert> actually maybe the problem I'm thinking of is irrelevant with the new schema
2011-03-16T19:27:32  <janzert> let me look :)
2011-03-16T19:28:33  <janzert> looks like it could still be a problem...
2011-03-16T19:28:54  <janzert> when handing out a game task the server should do a last minute check that all the submissions involved are still active
2011-03-16T19:29:17  <janzert> for the last contest with only 2 player games the game was simply discarded if that wasn't the case
2011-03-16T19:30:01  <janzert> it might be better to try and see if the user has a new submission that is ready if the one involved in the game has been invalidated
2011-03-16T19:30:22  <janzert> and only throw the game out if there isn't a replacement submission ready yet
2011-03-16T19:31:27  <McLeopold> what if the older one just played anyway
2011-03-16T19:32:22  <janzert> it's a bit of a waste of resources, but I suppose with n-player games not a complete waste at least
2011-03-16T19:32:43  <McLeopold> it would matter less if I get the matchup table to only have as many matchups as there are workers
2011-03-16T19:33:10  <janzert> and do a pairing every time a game is turned in then?
2011-03-16T19:33:16  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-16T19:33:19  <McLeopold> that's my goal
2011-03-16T19:33:20  <janzert> hmm, might work
2011-03-16T19:33:33  <McLeopold> it makes finding the mu so much faster
2011-03-16T19:33:55  <McLeopold> rather than doing games based on mu's that are several games behind
2011-03-16T19:34:01  <janzert> why not eliminate the queue altogether
2011-03-16T19:34:14  <janzert> just do the pairing on demand when a game task is requested
2011-03-16T19:34:21  <McLeopold> so I don't make myself crazy when doing the rankings
2011-03-16T19:34:32  <McLeopold> oh, yeah, that
2011-03-16T19:35:09  <janzert> more accurately when a task is requested and no compile tasks are pending
2011-03-16T19:35:14  <McLeopold> it will be close, but I still want to use server idle time to do it
2011-03-16T19:35:23  <McLeopold> so that it is ready
2011-03-16T19:35:33  <McLeopold> just keep the queue at workers + 1
2011-03-16T19:35:37  <McLeopold> or so
2011-03-16T19:35:44  <McLeopold> or even just 1
2011-03-16T19:35:47  <janzert> except workers + 1 is hard to determine
2011-03-16T19:36:22  <McLeopold> so, a task is requested, the game is handed out and spawns a process to generate the next
2011-03-16T19:36:49  <janzert> yeah, that would work so long as it does something sensible if another is requested before the first is generated
2011-03-16T19:36:56  <McLeopold> usually, that will happen just after a game result
2011-03-16T19:37:32  <McLeopold> the second request could wait for the entry to be available, then start generating it's own
2011-03-16T19:37:33  <janzert> like generate the pairing without spawning a process
2011-03-16T19:37:52  <McLeopold> I use that term loosly
2011-03-16T19:38:08  <janzert> maybe spawn off the generation before trying to hand out a pairing
2011-03-16T19:38:13  <McLeopold> I'm really hoping for a mysql procedure
2011-03-16T19:38:43  <McLeopold> well, that introduces a delay, that's why I'd rather have one waiting
2011-03-16T19:38:48  <janzert> then it will start generation of however many parallel requests are in progress

2011-03-16T19:39:02  <janzert> I mean spawn it off so it executes in parallel
2011-03-16T19:39:10  <janzert>  of grabbing the one that should be in the queue
2011-03-16T19:39:21  <McLeopold> the handing out will be instant, so it doesn't really matter
2011-03-16T19:39:49  <janzert> yep, but say 5 requests come in for a game at once
2011-03-16T19:40:26  <janzert> if the generation starts at the beginning of the request can they happen in parallel instead of waiting for each one to complete?
2011-03-16T19:40:28  <McLeopold> they would chain

2011-03-16T19:44:29  <janzert> I do really like the idea of having a very small queue with additional pairing triggered either by a request or turn in
2011-03-16T19:45:46  <janzert> maybe just have a queue low water mark configuration setting that could be manually adjusted to approximately the number of workers and have two pairings generated whenever the queue length dropped below that
2011-03-16T19:46:19  <McLeopold> if it is fast enough, maybe just calculating on the fly is best
2011-03-16T19:46:25  <McLeopold> less work

2011-03-16T19:47:37  <janzert> any idea what the pairing speed complexity is?
2011-03-16T19:48:16  <janzert> i.e. rough big O notation
2011-03-16T19:50:31  <janzert> picking the seed user will be linear
2011-03-16T19:51:33  <janzert> choosing number of players seems linear in the number of games played by the seed
2011-03-16T19:52:06  <janzert> choosing map, linear from number of maps
2011-03-16T19:53:39  <janzert> hmm, just noticed point 4.3 for choosing players
2011-03-16T19:53:46  <jbroman> OK, so quick question for those who care: should the jail include a chroot? It is (yet) another layer of protection, but a bit of a hassle (all of the programming languages, etc. must be installed in the chroot environment). Do people think it's necessary? I'm on the fence myself at this point.
2011-03-16T19:53:58  <janzert> I think that needs to be dropped, it forces the tournament to be a round robin initially
2011-03-16T19:54:18  <janzert> jbroman: I'd like it to
2011-03-16T19:54:53  <janzert> and then the programming languages should *only* be installed in the chroot
2011-03-16T19:55:03  <janzert> not in the general worker environment
2011-03-16T19:55:10  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm ignoring most of the text in the current trueskill matchmaking and going with my first idea
2011-03-16T19:55:16  <jbroman> Which makes sense. As long as people are willing to tolerate that.
2011-03-16T19:55:46  <janzert> willing to tolerate it how?
2011-03-16T19:55:57  <janzert> McLeopold: oh, ok :/
2011-03-16T19:56:05  <jbroman> Stupid things like the fact that you can't do apt-get install without chrooting first.
2011-03-16T19:56:17  <janzert> ahh, well no one should be doing that at all
2011-03-16T19:56:27  <Frontier> uh.. does that mean you have to install all dependencies there too?
2011-03-16T19:56:28  <janzert> except the worker setup script

2011-03-16T19:57:01  <janzert> ?
2011-03-16T19:57:08  <McLeopold> janzert: what's wrong with a round robin initially?
2011-03-16T19:57:08  <janzert> it only matters for contest workers at all
2011-03-16T19:57:11  <jbroman> It would also be nice because the way I'm picturing this, we could also capture the writes that each bot (tried to) make.
2011-03-16T19:57:22  <jbroman> Without having to strace them.
2011-03-16T19:57:29  <janzert> McLeopold: that is lots and lots of games that provide no useful information
2011-03-16T19:57:38  <McLeopold> janzert: if X is 1?
2011-03-16T19:57:58  <janzert> what is X?
2011-03-16T19:58:11  <McLeopold> how many games you get before seeing the same bot again
2011-03-16T19:58:18  <Frontier> If you plan to allow binary submissions remember to make the architecture public or ppl will upload 64-bit windows programs :p
2011-03-16T19:58:35  <McLeopold> Frontier: no binary for epsilon
2011-03-16T19:59:03  <janzert> I'm not sure what that has to do with the tournament being a round robin instead of trueskill paired?
2011-03-16T19:59:07  <jbroman> Frontier: For sure. If we sanction binary, we'll release the platform. Though I kind of like the idea of leaving it as an "at your own peril" thing.
2011-03-16T19:59:43  <McLeopold> janzert: with thousands of entries, there should be enough bots to choose good matches without having to play the exact same bots several times over

2011-03-16T20:00:23  <McLeopold> If 2 bots stabalize near each other, it would suck if they were always paired together in games
2011-03-16T20:00:40  <janzert> McLeopold: yes, there should be but if the pairing is implemented as give on the wiki (specifically 4.3 in the future section) it will just be a round robin until everyone has played everyone else
2011-03-16T20:01:36  <McLeopold> I think you're reading it wrong
2011-03-16T20:02:06  <McLeopold> X is used to configure how many games before a repeat
2011-03-16T20:02:06  <janzert> it will start with the nearest trueskill pairing but will keep getting worse until everyone has played everyone
2011-03-16T20:02:17  <janzert> X doesn't figure into that point at all
2011-03-16T20:02:27  <McLeopold> that only makes sense if mu doesn't change
2011-03-16T20:03:00  <McLeopold> and not until everyone has played everyone, just until everyone has played x games
2011-03-16T20:03:37  <janzert> I guess it's not quite everyone played everone, but it is everone played at least one of the players in each game
2011-03-16T20:04:06  <McLeopold> yes, which will be a really small percentage of bots, but enough that you don't get screwed on your pairings
2011-03-16T20:04:49  <McLeopold> if mu is moving, you will get good matches without hitting that limit
2011-03-16T20:05:11  <McLeopold> if mu is stable, a person is going to want suboptimal matches so they can see how other bots play against them
2011-03-16T20:05:14  <janzert> this limit overrides all trueskill concerns
2011-03-16T20:05:37  <McLeopold> see my previous 2 comments

2011-03-16T20:12:11  <McLeopold> it was the first version I posted, edited by you
2011-03-16T20:12:17  <McLeopold> janzert: look at the page history
2011-03-16T20:12:59  <McLeopold> I should have clued into your question of "what is X" :?
2011-03-16T20:13:11  <janzert> :}
2011-03-16T20:14:21  <janzert> question I've wondered about off and on, why are you choosing the number of players before choosing the map?
2011-03-16T20:14:34  <janzert> why not just choose a map?
2011-03-16T20:15:03  <McLeopold> the map and number of players are tied together
2011-03-16T20:15:10  <janzert> then we could have for example 2-high player maps, 4-medium player maps and 8 low player maps
2011-03-16T20:15:13  <McLeopold> I'm limiting the pool of maps to choose from
2011-03-16T20:15:21  <janzert> and people will get games in that proportion
2011-03-16T20:15:57  <janzert> choosing the number of players first means they play the high player maps twice as often as the medium player maps
2011-03-16T20:16:34  <McLeopold> no, it means for a seed player, we ensure an even distribution of maps by player number
2011-03-16T20:16:36  <janzert> i.e. the proportion of number of players is always even
2011-03-16T20:17:14  <janzert> but why do we want that instead of just even distribution over all the maps?
2011-03-16T20:17:31  <janzert> I don't see any benefit and it seems like a disadvantage
2011-03-16T20:17:34  <McLeopold> ummm...
2011-03-16T20:17:46  <McLeopold> I was assuming an even set of map
2011-03-16T20:18:32  <McLeopold> so, I could just rotate on map_id rather than number of players
2011-03-16T20:18:36  <sigh> janzert: I guess he doesn't want to end up with some players who play more 8 player games (say) than 2 player games

2011-03-16T20:19:22  <McLeopold> sigh: yes, but I was assuming we'd keep the set of maps evenly distributed across number of players
2011-03-16T20:19:31  <janzert> if we just rotate on based on map so the seed never plays a map that it has already played more than some other map I think we'll be better off
2011-03-16T20:19:50  <McLeopold> yes, that works
2011-03-16T20:20:24  <McLeopold> I did want some type of rotation for number of players, so a new submission will get each type up front
2011-03-16T20:20:46  <McLeopold> The less waiting to see if you do good on a 2-player map, the better
2011-03-16T20:21:12  <janzert> I'm not sure but I'm thinking we may want to distribute number of maps inversely to the number of players in the map
2011-03-16T20:21:27  <janzert> Hmm, yeah that might be nice
2011-03-16T20:21:52  <janzert> just make it a strictly lower priority than choosing a least played map and it should accomplish that
2011-03-16T20:22:19  <McLeopold> unless we have a bunch of x-player maps
2011-03-16T20:22:29  <McLeopold> over and above the other player-number maps
2011-03-16T20:22:55  <janzert> let me state it a little differently, you initial pool will be all the maps since the seed won't have played on any
2011-03-16T20:22:57  <McLeopold> again, there was a "no repeat" logic there that can be tuned
2011-03-16T20:23:22  <janzert> after the first game eliminate that map from the pool
2011-03-16T20:24:11  <janzert> then choose a map from that pool that has a different number of players
2011-03-16T20:24:42  <janzert> and so on until each number of players has been used and every map has been used
2011-03-16T20:25:07  <janzert> basically just swap your 2 and 3
2011-03-16T20:25:50  <McLeopold> okay, but if there are 10-2player, 5-3player, you will hit a string of 2player maps at some point
2011-03-16T20:25:51  <janzert> but instead of picking a specific map when looking for a map that was played least often, take all the maps that have been played least often
2011-03-16T20:26:18  <McLeopold> just like user_id for seed, it will be the whole list with an ordering
2011-03-16T20:26:25  <janzert> hmm, yes
2011-03-16T20:27:13  <janzert> maybe instead of a rotation it should just be if you haven't played a n-player match yet then choose one of those
2011-03-16T20:27:36  <janzert> then once you've gone through the initial rotation of player numbers it is just random

2011-03-16T20:28:00  <janzert> as far as number of players
2011-03-16T20:28:04  <McLeopold> janzert: so, you're talking per submission_id now?
2011-03-16T20:28:34  <janzert> yes, for choosing the map and number of players it should be submission based
2011-03-16T20:28:46  <McLeopold> okay, good point
2011-03-16T20:29:11  <McLeopold> we can still bias against recently played maps for the user as well

2011-03-16T20:29:31  <janzert> yeah, if it's not too much work that would be good
2011-03-16T20:29:57  <janzert> but it should be a strictly lower criteria than the submission based

2011-03-16T22:57:12  <McLeopold> bss03: you around?
2011-03-16T22:59:10  <bss03> Sort of.
2011-03-16T22:59:13  <bss03> It's bedtime.
2011-03-16T22:59:29  <bss03> McLeopold: I saw you merged what I had.  Any issues so far?
2011-03-16T23:08:20  <McLeopold> bss03: I'm finally reviewing the sql
2011-03-16T23:14:41  <bss03> McLeopold: Constructive critisism?
2011-03-16T23:15:00  <McLeopold> well, we think differently
2011-03-16T23:15:05  <bss03> Or, have I shown my hopeless n00b side?
2011-03-16T23:15:18  <McLeopold> it only matters what runs faster
2011-03-16T23:15:30  <McLeopold> and, sometimes, what is readable by others
2011-03-16T23:15:42  <McLeopold> take a look at my sql that I put at the top of the file
2011-03-16T23:16:43  <McLeopold> I tend to favor subqueries over joins.  I can't say if they are always faster, but a lot of the time they are.
2011-03-16T23:16:50  <bss03> I saw that.  I was pretty sure correlated sub-selects would be slower in mysql.
2011-03-16T23:17:11  <McLeopold> the case statement can't be fast, can it?
2011-03-16T23:17:36  <McLeopold> but, I guess you are really doing the same thing I am, just in one column
2011-03-16T23:17:58  <bss03> Usually they are pretty fast, but I'm fine writing as sub-selects if that's more readable.
2011-03-16T23:18:32  <McLeopold> I wrote a join version too.  I'm going to load lots of fake data and see if I can get a benchmark
2011-03-16T23:19:11  <bss03> Kk.  Would love to hear the results.  I want pairing to be as fast as reasonable.
2011-03-16T23:19:28  <McLeopold> If you read the logs, janzert and I had some ideas for that.
2011-03-16T23:19:32  <bss03> I remember some of the slow periods of PW; I wanna get lots of games in. >:)
2011-03-16T23:19:56  <McLeopold> That wasn't the matchmaking though.
2011-03-16T23:20:05  <bss03> I saw janzert had some stuff he wanted to change that might require joining with submission more often.
2011-03-16T23:20:37  <McLeopold> Yes, so we were thinking picking the seed player is based off of user_id, but the other requirements based off of submission_id.
2011-03-16T23:21:27  <McLeopold> for subqueries, if it is not correlated, it should be better, because the results are cached
2011-03-16T23:22:42  <bss03> For creating matchups, I figured I'd basically select from my temporary table into mathup_player, after creating the matchup based off python variables.
2011-03-16T23:23:13  <bss03>  Yeah, I used a non-correlated sub-query in best_player_count.
2011-03-16T23:23:42  <bss03> I figured MySQL was smart enough to only do non-correlated subqueries as needed.
2011-03-16T23:25:28  <sigh> MySQL can be pretty dumb... best use explain to figure out what it is actually doing
2011-03-16T23:25:35  <bss03> I'm only on from about 6pm to about 10pm my time.  (US/Central)  But, I do check the wiki and messages on IRC before I do any coding for the night.
2011-03-16T23:25:51  <bss03> sigh: Yeah, I confirmed with EXPLAIN.
2011-03-16T23:26:20  <bss03> I pretty much used EXPLAIN on all of the queries, to see if indexes were being used and what ones might be useful.
2011-03-16T23:27:40  <bss03> The ugliest query is next_player, but it rolls a lot of conditions together and it may not work with the schema changes...
2011-03-16T23:28:00  <bss03> ISTR MYSQL used to complain if I qualified user_id, and now it complains that it is ambiguous. :(
2011-03-16T23:30:06  <bss03> Anyway, past my bedtime.  I'll check it tomorrow if I find time again.  It feel like it has been a busy week so far.
2011-03-16T23:30:32  <bss03> I'd really like to get the SQL ironed out so I can work on jmcarthur's Haskell stuff some more.
2011-03-16T23:32:31  <bss03> Feel free to email me (bss@iguanasuicide.net) if you want to write longer prose than is suitable for IRC.
2011-03-16T23:33:45  <McLeopold> night
2011-03-16T23:39:31  <McLeopold> sigh: after some reading, apparently MySQL sucks at subqueries. :(
2011-03-16T23:39:56  <sigh> oh, I could have told you that :P
2011-03-16T23:40:08  <sigh> it likes to create temporary tables
2011-03-16T23:40:36  <McLeopold> So, I guess I need to write crappy sql now...
2011-03-16T23:56:37  <amstan> bss03: careful with emails in this channel, the logs are http public
2011-03-16T23:59:06  <McLeopold> amstan: can I ask a stupid ubuntu question?
2011-03-16T23:59:13  <amstan> McLeopold: of course
