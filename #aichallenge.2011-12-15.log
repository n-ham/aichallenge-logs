2011-12-15T02:12:36  <antimatroid> he said before he's messing with his food gathering code
2011-12-15T02:13:40  <codetiger> I was messing with diffusion until a couple of days back
2011-12-15T02:13:54  <codetiger> Just added some combat
2011-12-15T02:13:56  <antimatroid> i'm still messing with everything
2011-12-15T02:14:09  <codetiger> and you guys on tcp kick by bots butt
2011-12-15T02:14:09  <antimatroid> i noticed some friendly collisions before so i'm about to work out how the fuck that happened
2011-12-15T02:14:45  <TL_> i've re-upload my bot for 6 days in a row, and every new upload seems to have a lower skill than the last for almost the same number of games. :(
2011-12-15T02:14:53  <codetiger> meanwhile, I just found running on to food is ignored
2011-12-15T02:15:18  <codetiger> TL_: you are not alone
2011-12-15T02:16:53  <codetiger> Mine once had 75 skills and now every update is struggling to reach 72 and my new bot is still struggling to reach 70
2011-12-15T02:17:29  <codetiger> I just feel sick, every other player on TCP is better than me
2011-12-15T02:17:34  <BenJackson> finally broke into top 30 on my latest submit
2011-12-15T02:17:42  <antimatroid> codetiger: tcp is where the top bots test
2011-12-15T02:17:42  <BenJackson> codetiger: tcp is tough
2011-12-15T02:18:25  <BenJackson> tcp has less than 1% the bots of the challenge but msot of the players in the top 10
2011-12-15T02:18:41  <BenJackson> and some people are playing more than one entry
2011-12-15T02:18:54  <antimatroid> now i just need to find one of these collisions while debugging is turned on :\
2011-12-15T02:18:54  <BenJackson> codetiger: you know about bhickey.net, right?
2011-12-15T02:18:56  <codetiger> many people are playing more than 10 entries
2011-12-15T02:19:55  <codetiger> yeah, my bot came first in bhickey.net
2011-12-15T02:20:07  <codetiger> so I thought it was not a good place for my bot
2011-12-15T02:20:46  <codetiger> and there was only one player bj_v4 and bj_v5 to compete. So I was not able to judge my bots performance
2011-12-15T02:21:10  <BenJackson> I will switch to v7 if you want
2011-12-15T02:21:26  <codetiger> sure
2011-12-15T02:21:38  <codetiger> but isn't that server down couple of days
2011-12-15T02:21:52  <BenJackson> well my bots were playing games
2011-12-15T02:21:58  <BenJackson> but you're right that I can't get to it via the web
2011-12-15T02:22:05  <BenJackson> @seen bmh
2011-12-15T02:22:05  <contestbot> BenJackson: bmh was last seen in #aichallenge 1 day, 5 hours, 57 minutes, and 50 seconds ago: <bmh> BenJackson: can you tell me if bhickey.net:2080 is alive? I have a really slow internet connectoin at the moment
2011-12-15T02:22:50  <codetiger> its not live.. the web end is down
2011-12-15T02:23:06  <BenJackson> the server was playing games until just a minute ago at least
2011-12-15T02:23:42  <codetiger> yes, playing games is still possible, but I want to check my bot's performance. using visualizer.
2011-12-15T02:23:44  <codetiger> :(
2011-12-15T02:24:11  <GarfTop> codetiger: on aichallenge or tcp severs (skill drop)?
2011-12-15T02:24:14  <BenJackson> I emailed him
2011-12-15T02:24:44  <codetiger> BenJackson: Thanks for that...
2011-12-15T02:25:09  <codetiger> GarfTop: aichallenge, but with every new submit
2011-12-15T02:25:33  <codetiger> and I guess that was my fault with some strategy tuning
2011-12-15T02:26:05  <codetiger> even tcpants.com is very tough
2011-12-15T02:26:26  <GarfTop> I submitted a bot that was about 3 mu better on fluxid, and it dropped :-/
2011-12-15T02:27:07  <codetiger> fluxid, it happens
2011-12-15T02:27:21  <GarfTop> well it dropped on aichallenge, I mean
2011-12-15T02:27:49  <GarfTop> I'm confused now whether it was really better and skills are being pushed down (which would be somewhat expected), or fluxid is not representative
2011-12-15T02:28:02  <BenJackson> fluxid skills are pretty wild too
2011-12-15T02:28:10  <BenJackson> there are so many more games
2011-12-15T02:28:15  <BenJackson> and the population changes
2011-12-15T02:28:20  <GarfTop> I always run 2 bots simultanously on tcp, so drift shouldn't affect me there
2011-12-15T02:28:30  <BenJackson> my bot will get to 3rd or something and I'll quit playing and a few hours later it's at 10
2011-12-15T02:29:22  <codetiger> BJ, how do you guys test your bots. I know testing it against my old version is not good idea
2011-12-15T02:29:46  <antimatroid> codetiger: most of my testing is done with very specific situations i set up myself

2011-12-15T02:29:51  <BenJackson> I use my old versions, but I have strong old versions
2011-12-15T02:30:03  <antimatroid> then i may run a couple of games or something on tcp just to look for flaws etc.
2011-12-15T02:30:17  <antimatroid> BenJackson: the problem with that is often your old bots and new bots think a lot alike
2011-12-15T02:30:26  <antimatroid> ie. with combat they often consider similar sets of moves etc.
2011-12-15T02:30:38  <BenJackson> I've had 3 top 20 bots that are pretty significantly different
2011-12-15T02:30:49  <antimatroid> fair enough
2011-12-15T02:30:55  <BenJackson> plus I have even older ones that represent players that blunder around with no combat
2011-12-15T02:31:11  <antimatroid> i try to think my strategy through before implementing, although details change as i discover what's feasible and think of other things
2011-12-15T02:31:12  <BenJackson> also I set things up to give old bots an advantage
2011-12-15T02:31:19  <BenJackson> tell them where my new bot's hill is
2011-12-15T02:31:30  <BenJackson> use a map with close neighbors and give an old one a weak opponent
2011-12-15T02:31:43  <antimatroid> i can't even find the old game with collisions now :\
2011-12-15T02:31:55  <antimatroid> there was one part of a game where it just started suiciding bots in one region :\
2011-12-15T02:32:04  <BenJackson> and generally I don't play on fluxid or resubmit until my new version is reliably killing all my old versions

2011-12-15T02:32:47  <codetiger> on my local it does
2011-12-15T02:32:48  <antimatroid> yeah results seem quite random to me on those maps?
2011-12-15T02:32:52  <BenJackson> I've also used setups like extremely low food
2011-12-15T02:33:23  <codetiger> may be I should try, giving advantage to old versions like you said
2011-12-15T02:33:47  <antimatroid> BenJackson: do you timeout on tcp much?
2011-12-15T02:33:49  <BenJackson> you could also try having your new version wait a few turns before moving
2011-12-15T02:33:57  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I don't think so
2011-12-15T02:34:03  <BenJackson> but I haven't been looking at fluxid results today
2011-12-15T02:34:04  <antimatroid> i get a few timeouts, yet if debugging is one it usually seems to think it returned go well within the time limit

2011-12-15T02:34:10  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=239093&user=757 I like how SDIL behaves

2011-12-15T02:34:36  <antimatroid> ~340ms for me
2011-12-15T02:35:15  <antimatroid> but that should still stay well under 5s or whatever it is?

2011-12-15T02:38:04  <BenJackson> v4 is gone
2011-12-15T02:38:11  <BenJackson> I can take down 5 too
2011-12-15T02:38:19  <bmh> v5 accounts for half of all the games played :)
2011-12-15T02:39:24  <kevlar> so, is it just me or is it taking a lot longer for new versions to make their way back up to a stable skill level than it did before?

2011-12-15T02:45:10  <BenJackson> well you're #1
2011-12-15T02:45:32  <BenJackson> but if you lose to bj_v4 that's bad
2011-12-15T02:45:38  <codetiger> thats because, I left it to play 100 games in a row
2011-12-15T02:46:05  <BenJackson> the key to beating bj_v4 is minimal combat
2011-12-15T02:46:13  <BenJackson> basically anything that ensures you have 2 ants where they have 1
2011-12-15T02:46:56  <codetiger> mine does good with bj_v4 if its not close neighbour multihill maze
2011-12-15T02:47:08  <BenJackson> about all v5 has over v4 is minimal combat
2011-12-15T02:47:12  <BenJackson> and it slaughters v4
2011-12-15T02:47:32  <BenJackson> V7 tunes the combat and adds better food gathering and exploration
2011-12-15T02:48:12  *** Kurnevsky <Kurnevsky!~Errins@217.21.41.205> has left #aichallenge
2011-12-15T02:48:18  <BenJackson> my V4 strategy and still a big part through V7 was "have more ants, try to run over people"
2011-12-15T02:48:32  <BenJackson> which works against similar ants
2011-12-15T02:48:39  <BenJackson> but against better combat it's suicide
2011-12-15T02:48:50  <codetiger> mine crossed 850 turns with your v7 so am happy
2011-12-15T02:49:31  <codetiger> what factors do I consider before choosing suicide?
2011-12-15T02:49:33  <antimatroid> i'm at turn 740 :\
2011-12-15T02:49:41  <antimatroid> don't choose suicide
2011-12-15T02:49:44  <BenJackson> suicide is usually bad
2011-12-15T02:49:56  <BenJackson> in > 1v1 if you suicide everyone else benefits
2011-12-15T02:50:35  <BenJackson> better to retreat and send another ant to form a wall
2011-12-15T02:50:45  <antimatroid> BenJackson: is your evaluation of battle states secret?
2011-12-15T02:51:06  <BenJackson> I think one flaw in this game is that there's no "easy" combat (like diffusion is "easy" strategy)
2011-12-15T02:51:10  <antimatroid> when i get to comparing ant deaths, atm i tiebreak off enemyDeaths-friendDeaths then other stuff
2011-12-15T02:51:24  <BenJackson> yeah, I do eventually trade ants
2011-12-15T02:51:28  <antimatroid> but i'm wondering if 1 death for 2 kills, or n deaths for n+kills is worthwhile?
2011-12-15T02:51:29  <BenJackson> but almost never 1 on 1
2011-12-15T02:51:36  <antimatroid> maybe just minimise friend deaths then maximise enemy deaths?
2011-12-15T02:51:40  <BenJackson> for me that depends on board state, location, etc
2011-12-15T02:51:48  <antimatroid> how is that a flaw?
2011-12-15T02:51:55  <antimatroid> combat is what makes this game imo
2011-12-15T02:52:06  <TL_> lots of strong bots participated just this December. protocolocon is climbing. that SDIL may make it to the top15
2011-12-15T02:52:09  <BenJackson> antimatroid: would be better if the AI writing had an easier learning curve for new participants
2011-12-15T02:52:44  <BenJackson> peopel manage to gather food and get stuck trying to do any combat
2011-12-15T02:53:27  <BenJackson> antimatroid: no, not a state secret
2011-12-15T02:53:40  <BenJackson> probably more complex than necessary now that I've seen other ideas
2011-12-15T02:53:42  <antimatroid> hmmm, i like the games to be simple enough for beginners to be able to participate and compete with each other but have enough depth that people like us are still interested in competing
2011-12-15T02:54:05  <antimatroid> other ideas? for battle?
2011-12-15T02:54:12  <BenJackson> codetiger: http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.14678 nice work
2011-12-15T02:54:12  <antimatroid> i was a big proponent for this battle resolution
2011-12-15T02:54:28  <BenJackson> I thikn the bug in V7 there is that super long paths cause it to not bother to explore
2011-12-15T02:54:58  <antimatroid> most other candidates just favoured spreading your ants out and not getting more than one ant involved in a battle etc.
2011-12-15T02:55:01  <antimatroid> which is very boring
2011-12-15T02:55:10  <BenJackson> antimatroid: anyway my original battle plan was to (conceptutally) make a matrix of all possible enemy moves vs all my possible moves
2011-12-15T02:55:19  <antimatroid> lol :P
2011-12-15T02:55:19  <BenJackson> then try variations of my moves against all enemy moves simultaneously
2011-12-15T02:55:22  <BenJackson> and maximize a score function
2011-12-15T02:55:32  <BenJackson> but not variations of *their* moves
2011-12-15T02:55:43  <antimatroid> you do realise how large that matrix would be right?
2011-12-15T02:55:52  <BenJackson> it's not very big
2011-12-15T02:55:56  <BenJackson> only participating ants
2011-12-15T02:56:05  <BenJackson> and it's 5*n, not 5^n
2011-12-15T02:56:15  <antimatroid> how?
2011-12-15T02:56:30  <BenJackson> take a piece of graph paper
2011-12-15T02:56:31  <codetiger> do you guys think hill defense, is worth it? I removed it few versions back and now mine does better. But I think my bot still needs it.
2011-12-15T02:56:33  <antimatroid> if you have {N,E} x {W,S} there's 4 combinations
2011-12-15T02:56:47  <BenJackson> across the top write "ant 0" and for ant 0 have 5 moves (nsew, still)
2011-12-15T02:56:52  <BenJackson> for each ant
2011-12-15T02:56:55  <antimatroid> ohhhh
2011-12-15T02:57:03  <BenJackson> down the side put the locations of everywhere an enemy could go
2011-12-15T02:57:07  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-12-15T02:57:09  <BenJackson> where they are now +4
2011-12-15T02:57:12  <antimatroid> what are you doing now for battle?
2011-12-15T02:57:15  <BenJackson> put a '1' anywhere they're in range
2011-12-15T02:57:24  <antimatroid> do you use possible battle enemy/friend information when picking moves?
2011-12-15T02:57:38  <BenJackson> then maximize the set of my moves that avoids having any enemy threatened exactly once
2011-12-15T02:57:45  <BenJackson> 0 times is ok, >=2 is good
2011-12-15T02:57:47  <BenJackson> 1 is bad
2011-12-15T02:58:03  <BenJackson> it's basically perfect for 2 on 1 but trades 2 for 2 and above
2011-12-15T02:58:33  <BenJackson> that's all V5 and V7 do, with some misc side factors so that "don't care" moves do something useful
2011-12-15T02:59:07  <antimatroid> do you minimax your possible move sets?
2011-12-15T02:59:25  <antimatroid> i pick out like 5 sets of moves for my ants and 3-4 for them and run minimax on that
2011-12-15T02:59:37  <BenJackson> no
2011-12-15T02:59:43  <antimatroid> it's just a matter of picking good heuristics for picking out those sets of moves
2011-12-15T02:59:55  <BenJackson> I try a few thousand combinations of moves and take the highest scoring one
2011-12-15T03:00:04  <BenJackson> simulated annealing
2011-12-15T03:00:32  <antimatroid> that's cooler
2011-12-15T03:00:58  <antimatroid> i wanted to try adding in new sets of moves where dying ants move more defensively, but it's too messy to set up in the remaining days
2011-12-15T03:00:58  <BenJackson> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.34397
2011-12-15T03:01:11  <BenJackson> I think carlose_guia_v31_rc5 is standing on hills to control spawning there
2011-12-15T03:01:36  <BenJackson> antimatroid: if *I* had it to do again I'd do cheap combat as described in the forum
2011-12-15T03:01:42  <BenJackson> and spend my time optimizing strategy
2011-12-15T03:01:52  <antimatroid> my combat is very cheap :)
2011-12-15T03:02:06  <antimatroid> running minimax on like a 5x4 tree isn't very expensive
2011-12-15T03:02:20  <antimatroid> although i need to do it for each battle partition
2011-12-15T03:03:03  <codetiger> BJ: saw that v12 razing hills crazy... Congrates
2011-12-15T03:03:15  <BenJackson> I hope that game is evidence that I finally found a working anti-rotation code
2011-12-15T03:03:20  <BenJackson> er heuristic
2011-12-15T03:03:34  <antimatroid> blah i timed out again :\
2011-12-15T03:03:39  <BenJackson> antimatroid: at some point I started splitting combat into islands due to nonlinearities in my combat eval
2011-12-15T03:03:52  <antimatroid> bot thinks it returned go in 79ms though
2011-12-15T03:03:55  <BenJackson> also gives nice local information like relative strength
2011-12-15T03:05:12  * antimatroid waits for the game to turn up on fluxid.pl
2011-12-15T03:05:42  <BenJackson> wow rank 1314 on fluxid
2011-12-15T03:05:52  <BenJackson> BenJackson: you need donations to cover your disk space?  :)
2011-12-15T03:06:31  <antimatroid> bah, i debugged 79ms after outputting go and still timed out :\
2011-12-15T03:06:51  <antimatroid> either i'm starting my timer in the wrong place or my network really is that bad
2011-12-15T03:06:59  <antimatroid> BenJackson: when do you start your timer?
2011-12-15T03:07:05  <antimatroid> i start it when I receive "turn"
2011-12-15T03:07:20  <BenJackson> I don't actually use a timer for anything
2011-12-15T03:07:28  <BenJackson> but the C++ starter starts a timer and prints it in the debug
2011-12-15T03:07:34  <antimatroid> i wrote that bot :P
2011-12-15T03:07:38  <antimatroid> it starts it in a terrible place
2011-12-15T03:07:58  <antimatroid> it starts it when it receives "go"
2011-12-15T03:08:02  <BenJackson> the only concession I make to timing is to become increasingly suicidal over 200 ants
2011-12-15T03:08:05  <antimatroid> if you do much while reading input that's bad
2011-12-15T03:08:16  <antimatroid> although i think it's still acceptable for the starter bot
2011-12-15T03:08:32  <antimatroid> (i would do it differently if doing it again though obviously :P)
2011-12-15T03:09:08  <codetiger> do you guess what type of map is it?
2011-12-15T03:09:10  <BenJackson> I'm amazed I won that last aichallenge.org game
2011-12-15T03:09:15  <BenJackson> damn red poached my kill
2011-12-15T03:09:27  <antimatroid> still waiting on this game :(
2011-12-15T03:09:40  <BenJackson> antimatroid: when you lose on fluxid you ahve to wait for someone to win
2011-12-15T03:09:44  <antimatroid> i know
2011-12-15T03:09:57  <antimatroid> still sucks :P
2011-12-15T03:10:02  <antimatroid> i miss live tcp games
2011-12-15T03:10:15  <BenJackson> wowww red nearly poached my last kill too
2011-12-15T03:10:20  <antimatroid> it was cool watching planet wars tcp games as they played
2011-12-15T03:10:32  <BenJackson> I might need to use the same code that protects my hill to protect enemy hills against other enemies
2011-12-15T03:10:43  <antimatroid> of course you'd only really be able to do it with the information your bot receives
2011-12-15T03:11:04  <BenJackson> I won that game by about 1 step
2011-12-15T03:11:06  <antimatroid> BenJackson: hmmm, i don't protect enemy hills
2011-12-15T03:11:17  <antimatroid> that might be a pita to set up information for
2011-12-15T03:11:17  <BenJackson> look at the final move of http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=239612&user=3473
2011-12-15T03:11:24  <BenJackson> red got an early lead by poaching purple
2011-12-15T03:12:25  <antimatroid> my protection code just does a bfs out from hills to find enemies, then does an ordered bfs to an ant and moves it to meet the enemy on one of the enemies shortest paths to my hill
2011-12-15T03:12:26  <antimatroid> do you do that?
2011-12-15T03:13:37  *** Garf <Garf!~Garf@78-22-80-252.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-15T03:14:00  <antimatroid> as soon as possible too, so it'll move ants along the shortest path towards the enemy
2011-12-15T03:14:29  <antimatroid> so basically searches within the perimeter of my hill for an ant that can meet it at the hill if necessary, but as soon as possible
2011-12-15T03:16:21  <codetiger> antimatroid: what tcp server you are on?
2011-12-15T03:16:29  <antimatroid> fluxid

2011-12-15T03:16:52  <antimatroid> got my replay
2011-12-15T03:16:56  <antimatroid> i'm SkyCaptain
2011-12-15T03:17:01  <antimatroid> it's still a work in progrss
2011-12-15T03:17:14  <antimatroid> some things work really well, i'm trying to fix the things that don't before submissions close
2011-12-15T03:17:32  <antimatroid> i had the most ants when i timed out, but was way down in the rankings
2011-12-15T03:17:49  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I was thinking along those lines today
2011-12-15T03:18:00  <BenJackson> but the shortest path between two corners of a rectangle is... anywhere in the rectangle
2011-12-15T03:18:02  <antimatroid> which lines?
2011-12-15T03:18:16  <BenJackson> oh intercepting
2011-12-15T03:18:29  <antimatroid> BenJackson: what do you mean by rectangle? pastebin ascii example?
2011-12-15T03:18:39  <BenJackson> just pick two points in a grid
2011-12-15T03:18:41  <BenJackson> they make a rectangle
2011-12-15T03:18:47  <BenJackson> opposite corners
2011-12-15T03:18:52  <antimatroid> there is the problem of when you step too far in one direction and their chosen shortest path is now shorter than yours
2011-12-15T03:18:57  <BenJackson> all the manhattan paths through that rectangle are equal length
2011-12-15T03:19:15  <antimatroid> yeah sure, just go onto one of the shortest paths
2011-12-15T03:19:34  <BenJackson> but imagine one corner is your hill
2011-12-15T03:19:43  <antimatroid> if you have closest friend hill information it's fairly easy to just do an ordered bfs
2011-12-15T03:19:44  <BenJackson> the enemy ant can take either side of the rectangle first
2011-12-15T03:19:53  <antimatroid> rather than actually generating the enemy ants shortest path to friend hill info
2011-12-15T03:19:58  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-12-15T03:20:05  <BenJackson> anyawy my V11 does something like you describe
2011-12-15T03:20:06  <antimatroid> i haven't resolved that
2011-12-15T03:20:16  <antimatroid> but i haven't seen it being much of a problem
2011-12-15T03:20:20  <BenJackson> V12 I'm working on is more sophisticated
2011-12-15T03:20:30  <BenJackson> I'm inspired by xathis
2011-12-15T03:21:09  <BenJackson> V12 tries to make it a goal to already have ants in the way when enemies appear
2011-12-15T03:21:10  <antimatroid> if you do it right, your ants will push enemies away from your hills

2011-12-15T03:21:25  <antimatroid> based on possible enemy info?
2011-12-15T03:21:32  <antimatroid> i've considered that, but seems like a large use of ants
2011-12-15T03:21:47  <antimatroid> if you already have heaps of ants it's unlikely they'll just pop up near your hill
2011-12-15T03:21:51  *** jacob_strauss <jacob_strauss!~pocketirc@109.227.152.63> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-15T03:22:36  <BenJackson> the other modification of V12 is maybe a successful attempt to avoid having my combat formations rotate sideways and let enemies slip by
2011-12-15T03:23:04  <antimatroid> my combat is currently more offensive that it had been previously
2011-12-15T03:23:11  <antimatroid> but i think it might actually be working better for it :\
2011-12-15T03:23:21  <BenJackson> I forgot to run my unit test for that, but it passed, yay
2011-12-15T03:23:47  <BenJackson> when I tried to move beyond the "dumb" combat of V7 the lost "accidental aggressiveness" made V8 weaker for a long time
2011-12-15T03:23:53  <BenJackson> I had to do a lot of work on that
2011-12-15T03:27:15  <antimatroid> i plan to look at battle again once i work out what caused friends to collide before
2011-12-15T03:27:19  <antimatroid> that's BAD :)
2011-12-15T03:28:12  <BenJackson> my ants are very good at mopping up tmied out ants
2011-12-15T03:28:22  <BenJackson> but sometimes I wonder if I should leave them as a defensive screen
2011-12-15T03:28:47  <antimatroid> nah, claim the territory
2011-12-15T03:28:58  <antimatroid> it would just be a pita the navigate around them

2011-12-15T03:40:20  <BenJackson> my secret to not timing out is ignoring the timer
2011-12-15T03:40:30  <antimatroid> i don't know why it's even timing out
2011-12-15T03:40:37  <antimatroid> debug info claims it's returning "go" in under 100ms

2011-12-15T03:41:03  <antimatroid> that's what i think it is
2011-12-15T03:41:07  <antimatroid> i'm glad you get the same
2011-12-15T03:41:13  <Blkt> good morning everyone
2011-12-15T03:41:14  <antimatroid> i think i saw a1k0n time out too the other day
2011-12-15T03:41:14  <BenJackson> _flag: still hard to believe because it's actual timeout is 5s
2011-12-15T03:41:18  <_flag> Well it happens when I have a lot of ants but I still have short turns
2011-12-15T03:41:29  <antimatroid> its*
2011-12-15T03:41:33  <_flag> So I think the computational time of the engine contributes the timeout
2011-12-15T03:41:37  <antimatroid> oops sorry :P
2011-12-15T03:41:39  <_flag> But that's just an untested theory
2011-12-15T03:41:44  <antimatroid> i thought i was correcting myself
2011-12-15T03:42:03  <BenJackson> I'm looking at Flag's profile
2011-12-15T03:42:09  <antimatroid> _flag: when do you start your timer?
2011-12-15T03:42:13  <BenJackson> skill 81.91 is only 53rd now?
2011-12-15T03:42:14  <antimatroid> i start it when i receive "turn"
2011-12-15T03:42:14  <BenJackson> wow
2011-12-15T03:42:35  <BenJackson> _flag: I've read the engine and it shouldn't
2011-12-15T03:42:37  <_flag> antimatroid: after all the game information is initialized
2011-12-15T03:42:44  <_flag> But that time should be negligable
2011-12-15T03:42:52  <antimatroid> i update information as i read the state info
2011-12-15T03:42:53  <_flag> BenJackson: Have you read the tcp source code?
2011-12-15T03:43:02  <BenJackson> yes
2011-12-15T03:43:11  <_flag> Well I have no idea what it is then
2011-12-15T03:43:18  <BenJackson> oh you think it's contributing to it for tcp?
2011-12-15T03:43:22  <BenJackson> I've read the engine for the main contest
2011-12-15T03:43:36  <_flag> The tcp source code has a history of being buggy
2011-12-15T03:43:36  <BenJackson> if tcp has a bug where it's sitting ona  line or something I don't know about that
2011-12-15T03:43:43  <BenJackson> yeah I found a bug the first time I looked at it :)
2011-12-15T03:44:03  <_flag> Yeah, there were some security issues, etc.
2011-12-15T03:44:21  <_flag> It was kind of released as an alpha and not fully tested and completed
2011-12-15T03:44:32  <_flag> And the developer of it disappeared

2011-12-15T03:49:43  <antimatroid> what i should do is 2 ply minimax
2011-12-15T03:50:01  <BenJackson> I still don't see how min-max applies
2011-12-15T03:50:08  <BenJackson> their moves aren't a response to your moves
2011-12-15T03:50:24  <antimatroid> i know, but i try to pick their moves as a best response to my moves
2011-12-15T03:51:15  <antimatroid> then i assume they do what's worst for me
2011-12-15T03:51:34  <antimatroid> then i pick my moves which is the best out of those worst outcomes
2011-12-15T03:51:59  <BenJackson> yeah but I've constructed examples where that gives the wrong answer
2011-12-15T03:52:03  <antimatroid> it's no different to treating it like a payoff matrix then picking your strategy which maximises the worst outcome
2011-12-15T03:52:17  <antimatroid> such as?
2011-12-15T03:52:22  <BenJackson> I'd simplify it down to:  let's write a min-max AI to play rock-paper-scissors
2011-12-15T03:52:36  <BenJackson> ok, let's say I choose rock as default
2011-12-15T03:52:39  <BenJackson> what would they do?
2011-12-15T03:52:40  <BenJackson> paper!
2011-12-15T03:52:44  <BenJackson> ok, my best move is then scissors
2011-12-15T03:53:12  <BenJackson> scissors isn't *wrong* it's just based on your original assumption that you'd start with rock
2011-12-15T03:53:16  <antimatroid> sure, but i don't think other bots are analysing my bot's moves to realise it's always going "rock" and i'm suspect of how many "rock paper scissor" scenarios actually exist?
2011-12-15T03:53:17  <_flag> Yes, but not all options are equal
2011-12-15T03:53:19  <BenJackson> the same is true of ant combat, it's just harder to see
2011-12-15T03:53:49  <BenJackson> _flag: yes, that's the interesting thing, and I found basically 0 literature on simultaneous move games like that
2011-12-15T03:54:11  <antimatroid> take tron for example, that was simultaneous at each turn, yet minimax still reined supreme
2011-12-15T03:54:28  <antimatroid> BenJackson: games like what?
2011-12-15T03:54:33  <BenJackson> did it?  I read a1k0n's writeup
2011-12-15T03:54:43  <antimatroid> i just did my honours thesis on finite normal (simultaneous) form games
2011-12-15T03:54:48  <BenJackson> antimatroid: the list of simultaneous move games fits on like 1 page
2011-12-15T03:54:53  <BenJackson> rps, prisoner's dilemma
2011-12-15T03:55:05  <antimatroid> but most of it was to do with structural properties preserved with equivalence of games and various definitions of symmetric games
2011-12-15T03:55:10  <BenJackson> some similar games to prisoner's dilemma
2011-12-15T03:55:27  <antimatroid> BenJackson: there's 144 strategically different (ordinally) 2x2 games :P
2011-12-15T03:55:35  <BenJackson> yeah, there you go
2011-12-15T03:55:44  <BenJackson> the literature is about Nash equilibria
2011-12-15T03:55:50  <antimatroid> http://www.amazon.com/Topology-Games-Routledge-Advances-Theory/dp/0415336090

2011-12-15T03:57:25  <BenJackson> not the "symmetric" part
2011-12-15T03:57:31  <antimatroid> damn
2011-12-15T03:57:43  <antimatroid> most people who say yes to that have a very naive understanding
2011-12-15T03:58:30  <BenJackson> I did look into simultaneous games, but finding only the kind that book is about I was not that interested for this contest
2011-12-15T03:58:49  <BenJackson> I think there's an element of that in this game
2011-12-15T03:59:03  <BenJackson> we all actually went through a phase where we became "rational" and quit suiciding each other
2011-12-15T03:59:39  <BenJackson> I think the game rates on fluxid and aichallenge are going to converge
2011-12-15T04:02:13  <kevlar> so, the runtime actually kills bots that time out?
2011-12-15T04:03:38  <kevlar> I have been chasing down what I thought was my bot crashing when I think it's actually the runtime getting impatient and killing it :)

2011-12-15T04:18:10  <antimatroid> but that's a specific example
2011-12-15T04:18:34  <antimatroid> what i really don't get is why they're even walking over to that side of the passge
2011-12-15T04:18:38  <antimatroid> that makes no friggin sense
2011-12-15T04:18:43  <BenJackson> you know you can put &turn= ?row= ?col=

2011-12-15T04:19:37  <BenJackson> looks like you block your guy from going S so he doesn't move but the guy next to him goes E anyway
2011-12-15T04:20:13  <antimatroid> yeah, i'll run the bot in stuff and see where it's making the moves then go investigate

2011-12-15T04:36:16  <Fluxid> if you don't use all the limit, it's either network or you crash...
2011-12-15T04:36:55  <_flag> antimatroid: It has been more frequent recently
2011-12-15T04:37:02  <antimatroid> can the tcp client not detect a crash?

2011-12-15T05:15:28  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-15T05:16:09  <antimatroid> something really weird happened in that game
2011-12-15T05:16:31  <antimatroid> almost like my map information is wrong :\

2011-12-15T05:16:55  <Samvara> I think the tournament is more popular than anyone expected and the servers are getting hammered. Fortunately I write in C so clock cycles are something for other people to worry about :-)
2011-12-15T05:17:05  <Surya> Yeah, you keep killing yourself around 45-50

2011-12-15T05:17:49  <antimatroid> yeah it's not good :P
2011-12-15T05:17:53  <antimatroid> but hopefully i can just fix it
2011-12-15T05:17:56  <antimatroid> cheers
2011-12-15T05:18:00  <Surya> Samvara, I'm also looking for downloading maps directly from the viewer, I don't know if this feature exists
2011-12-15T05:19:17  <Samvara> I'd hack it up myself but I'm running out of time for genuine coding. I have to work tomorrow
2011-12-15T05:19:54  <antimatroid> Surya: the more wtf thing is why are they even congregating on the dead end side of a corridor?
2011-12-15T05:20:00  <antimatroid> i think they think there's an enemy or something
2011-12-15T05:21:31  <Fluxid> even then they shouldn't kill themselves at all...
2011-12-15T05:21:36  <Surya> Antimatroid: You don't have any protection so they don't go on each other? I mean, even with false informations, my ants wouldn't kill themselves
2011-12-15T05:21:49  <antimatroid> fluxid: i know, there's 2 wtfs in one
2011-12-15T05:22:03  <Fluxid> hope you'll find it
2011-12-15T05:22:10  <antimatroid> i don't expect it to be hard
2011-12-15T05:22:16  <Fluxid> oh, i know that it could be
2011-12-15T05:22:21  <Fluxid> BETA PARTICLES
2011-12-15T05:22:33  <antimatroid> once i get the debug info (i'm being lazy), it'll tell me exactly what I moved them for
2011-12-15T05:23:04  <antimatroid> i don't have the 2am problem
2011-12-15T05:23:12  <antimatroid> with debug info i can work out exactly what my bot is doing
2011-12-15T05:23:15  <Fluxid> btw those logs almost never worked for me
2011-12-15T05:23:28  <Fluxid> somehow seeds are often screwed
2011-12-15T05:23:42  <antimatroid> i don't read the seed anyway
2011-12-15T05:23:47  <Fluxid> ah, ok
2011-12-15T05:23:56  <Fluxid> i have small randomness builtin
2011-12-15T05:23:57  <Samvara> You can get debug info back from the game? How does that work?
2011-12-15T05:24:16  <Fluxid> Samvara: last button ont the right
2011-12-15T05:24:19  <Fluxid> BOT IN
2011-12-15T05:24:19  <antimatroid> i hate randomness, i like to be able to work out exactly what it did and why
2011-12-15T05:25:26  <Fluxid> well, i use it only to choose one direction of movement if there one than one with highest weight
2011-12-15T05:25:53  <antimatroid> i've considered randomly ordering each squares land neighbours in the first turn
2011-12-15T05:25:55  <antimatroid> i may still do that
2011-12-15T05:26:02  <antimatroid> so path finding isn't always favouring north etc.
2011-12-15T05:26:38  <Surya> Antimatroid: Why did you insert randomness, i mean, for debugging purpose, I comment the random value and pick a constant. I doesn't change the behavior of my bot but make it possible to debug.
2011-12-15T05:26:57  <antimatroid> i don't have any randomness
2011-12-15T05:27:05  <Surya> Enemy have I guess
2011-12-15T05:27:07  <Surya> ok
2011-12-15T05:28:56  <Samvara> Oh yeah, I know about that button... Hmmm, I get it that's what player_seed is for, so you can be deterministic and random and thus reconstruct the game.

2011-12-15T05:36:50  <antimatroid> i think my bot would favour the fact that it's fairly uniform
2011-12-15T05:36:58  <antimatroid> and it would require a smarter bot to exploit it not being so
2011-12-15T05:37:21  <antimatroid> ie. so ants could discover more patches of food

2011-12-15T08:35:34  <TL_> if your ant has seen an enemy hill before and it loses it out of sight (maybe your ant got killed or moved away) can your bot still remember the location of the enemy hill? or you just rely on the hill given in the input?
2011-12-15T08:35:54  <antimatroid> TL_: you have to track that information yourself
2011-12-15T08:36:00  <antimatroid> similarly for food
2011-12-15T08:37:38  <TL_> ok. how about previous food locations? do you keep track of it so that when the next food spawn occurs your ants are near it?
2011-12-15T08:38:31  <antimatroid> what?
2011-12-15T08:40:53  <TL_> the food are being spawned in the same place right? so if you could remember the location of previous foods you could make your ants wait in the location for the next re-spawn. i think i have read it somewhere. not sure if i remembered it correctly though.
2011-12-15T08:41:53  <antimatroid> each location on the grid will spawn food before a location spawns it twice
2011-12-15T08:42:02  <antimatroid> excepting when a food item is waiting to spawn where a static ant sits
2011-12-15T08:42:30  <antimatroid> you might want to track the last time food was seen at a square, that way for example you can go back to not visible squares that you haven't seen food at yet
2011-12-15T08:43:41  <antimatroid> i'm not sure that'd be very useful though
2011-12-15T08:45:30  <TL_> yeah. there's not much a bot could do for that data. thanks antimatroid. hope you fix your timeout bugs. back to working on my bot now.

2011-12-15T08:54:07  <Fluxid> do you remember a game, where you control a spider, and you need to walk on screen in such way so you can "take" as much as possible, but you can't allow your just being bult "net" to be broken by *something*...
2011-12-15T08:54:17  <Fluxid> for example second player

2011-12-15T09:25:17  <Fluxid> you take areas by drawing from edge to edge
2011-12-15T09:25:26  <Fluxid> this could work for 2 players or even more

2011-12-15T12:41:41  <rwest> nope
2011-12-15T12:42:19  <janzert> I believe many people had a problem with that using the java starter bot, apparently the parser in it is very inefficient
2011-12-15T12:42:32  <rwest> I used the java start bot
2011-12-15T12:42:36  <yoden> ah, that may be it, i'm definitely using that parser...
2011-12-15T12:42:43  <rwest> I am using that parser too
2011-12-15T12:42:50  <yoden> it's weird though, because my turn time on turn 2+ is like 5-30 ms
2011-12-15T12:42:58  <yoden> so I think it's mostly the JIT hosing me...

2011-12-15T12:43:33  <janzert> I believe it was particularly a problem on some multi-hill maps that sent a lot of data on the first turn

2011-12-15T12:44:18  <janzert> and I haven't seen any new threads on it in a while so someone may have fixed it as well
2011-12-15T12:44:38  <BenJackson> if it's just turn 1 timeouts though it wouldn't be so bad to bump the setup time
2011-12-15T12:44:44  <yoden> well
2011-12-15T12:44:50  <yoden> it's not *setup* timeouts
2011-12-15T12:44:59  <yoden> (I don't do any setup work at all now, trying to diagnose this)
2011-12-15T12:45:04  <yoden> it's first actual turn timeouts
2011-12-15T12:45:32  <rwest> yoden: do you do any initialization on first turn that you don't on others?

2011-12-15T12:45:54  <yoden> though... maybe i can try faking a turn during setup, using that longer amount of time to let the JIT do it's work
2011-12-15T12:46:42  <yoden> sort of; i have work I do for each newly visible tile
2011-12-15T12:47:14  <yoden> but it shouldn't be 10x slower than when i have a hundred ants exploring (should probably be faster)
2011-12-15T12:47:31  <yoden> I also think the timeouts are "clusted"
2011-12-15T12:47:42  <yoden> e.g, if you look at two of my timeouts from last night:
2011-12-15T12:47:49  <yoden> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=238161&user=2374
2011-12-15T12:47:50  <yoden> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=238195&user=2374
2011-12-15T12:47:58  <yoden> everyone else in those games timed out too, lol
2011-12-15T12:53:30  <BenJackson> visualizer doesn't really handle 1 turn games that well

2011-12-15T12:54:03  <yoden> it'd be nice if we could actually see how long things were taking on the server
2011-12-15T12:54:37  <janzert> the other 2 players that timeout there timed out 7 and 4 of there last 10 games each so not too surprising that they timed out
2011-12-15T12:57:46  <yoden> why did the game rate get very fast at ~5:20 AM server time?  I played like 10+ games in 20 minutes
2011-12-15T12:58:17  <yoden> hmm, i guess it's bursty in general, seems like I usually play games in pairs...

2011-12-15T13:04:40  <rwest> if only I had some actual attack code
2011-12-15T13:04:49  <rwest> rather than just stay close and out of range
2011-12-15T13:05:08  <janzert> less than a week although I need to discuss it with amstan and McLeopold to decide on a firm length
2011-12-15T13:05:40  <mcstar> o.O
2011-12-15T13:05:44  <mcstar> thats long
2011-12-15T13:06:14  <janzert> planetwars was 4 days
2011-12-15T13:06:15  <mcstar> i realize that less than a week could mean 1 sec, but i guess you meant close to that right?
2011-12-15T13:06:34  <janzert> I mean somewhere around the same as planetwars most likely

2011-12-15T13:08:05  <yoden-cloud> how many games do you think it will take most bots to get a stable trueskill?
2011-12-15T13:09:07  <janzert> yoden-cloud: depends on your definition of stable ;) but you should be pretty close with 25
2011-12-15T13:09:26  <janzert> usually less
2011-12-15T13:09:36  <yoden-cloud> well, i mean, you can define stable in terms of the sigma
2011-12-15T13:09:38  <yoden-cloud> yes?
2011-12-15T13:10:07  <janzert> I think most people would define in terms of distance to "true" rank
2011-12-15T13:10:19  <yoden-cloud> isn't that what the trueskill sigma represents?
2011-12-15T13:10:29  <yoden-cloud> possible error relative to 'true' rank?
2011-12-15T13:10:57  <janzert> mostly
2011-12-15T13:11:53  <janzert> it also measures variance in game play, so could theoretically never narrow beyond a certain amount
2011-12-15T13:12:01  <yoden-cloud> right
2011-12-15T13:12:42  <yoden-cloud> so once it ~stops decreasing, you're at approximate the correct amount of games
2011-12-15T13:13:16  <janzert> 20 games will almost always get your sigma under 3 if that gives you any extra feel for it
2011-12-15T13:14:38  <yoden-cloud> right
2011-12-15T13:14:39  <janzert> maybe almost always is too strong, but certainly usually in that I've never observed a counter example
2011-12-15T13:14:57  <yoden-cloud> i guess, it seems weird to stop playing games, when playing more games would cause a bot's trueskill to go up
2011-12-15T13:15:49  <janzert> ?
2011-12-15T13:16:33  <yoden-cloud> in games 25-29 of my last submission, trueskill has gone up by about 2
2011-12-15T13:16:49  <yoden-cloud> which isn't *that* much, but does push this submission to the highest skill of them =P
2011-12-15T13:17:27  <rwest> mine gained like 30 points around games 40-50

2011-12-15T13:18:35  <yoden-cloud> yeah, there's definitely a lot of noise in the current rankings because of how resubmissions work

2011-12-15T13:19:01  <mcstar> i even took screenshots
2011-12-15T13:19:05  <yoden-cloud> well, overall ranking will fluctuate a ton
2011-12-15T13:19:06  <yoden-cloud> sure
2011-12-15T13:19:14  <yoden-cloud> but shouldn't trueskill fluctuate less?

2011-12-15T13:23:26  <amstan> jack can give you like 1ms latency and can also transport midi

2011-12-15T13:29:08  <rwest> in school I had a class where I had to "difuse a binary bomb"
2011-12-15T13:29:11  <amstan> on MCUs usually it's hard to debug stuff with them
2011-12-15T13:29:13  <mcstar> jabbotts debug vis. is excellent
2011-12-15T13:29:22  <mcstar> it helped me quite much
2011-12-15T13:29:34  <mcstar> (not for debugging, but for realtime visualizing)
2011-12-15T13:29:43  <amstan> and usually not needed, since segfaults don't exist when you don't have an os, it's just that you might end up with random values where you don't expect

2011-12-15T13:51:00  <SMJ> how do the finals work?
2011-12-15T13:52:32  <BenJackson> 1st everyone submits their sekrit killer bots
2011-12-15T13:52:33  <mcstar> basically, you put a lot of hard work in your bot, and it will turn out useless for most of the people
2011-12-15T13:53:45  <g0llum> something wrong eith the workers ? i click around random profiles & the last game played was ~5:18 wherever i look
2011-12-15T13:54:47  <janzert> there's a few less running at the moment, but they're still churning out games
2011-12-15T13:54:58  <pairofdice> workers are working, cache trouble?
2011-12-15T13:55:37  <g0llum> well 3  or four less than normal shouldn't make a dent
2011-12-15T13:55:37  <janzert> g0llum: check the latest games page http://aichallenge.org/games.php

2011-12-15T13:55:58  <g0llum> k. convinced.
2011-12-15T13:56:15  <mcstar> is this a common strategy that everyone keeps his "sekrit" bot for the finals?
2011-12-15T13:56:34  <mcstar> sry, "sekrit killer"
2011-12-15T13:56:41  <janzert> there are generally a lot of last minute submissions
2011-12-15T13:56:57  <mcstar> pairofdice: why didnt you upload recently?
2011-12-15T13:57:13  <pairofdice> I haven't worked on the bot
2011-12-15T13:57:23  <yoden-cloud> i mean, i took this week off work to work on ants (well, and play starcraft xD)
2011-12-15T13:57:25  <mcstar> but you are here all the time :)
2011-12-15T13:57:54  <mcstar> turned out that im more effective when im not around irc
2011-12-15T14:00:00  <pairofdice> I wasn't very well prepared programming-skill wise for the challenge. I started preparing for the next one ;)

2011-12-15T14:12:50  <mcstar> xathis has a huge lead
2011-12-15T14:13:18  <mcstar> its somewhat annoying
2011-12-15T14:13:35  <mcstar> cause i watched a couple of his games, and he doesnt seem to do anything special
2011-12-15T14:13:39  <mcstar> not that i recognize
2011-12-15T14:14:16  <Antimony> I'm currently rank 103, mainly because my ants are too scared to ever attack

2011-12-15T14:18:18  <Antimony> my ants used to defend, but then they got smarter at combat

2011-12-15T14:18:35  <mcstar> :)
2011-12-15T14:18:49  <mcstar> this was a big lesson for me

2011-12-15T14:19:11  <mcstar> or at least you have to try them
2011-12-15T14:19:26  <mcstar> i spent much time just thinking about the "optimal" thing
2011-12-15T14:19:28  <mcstar> which is bs
2011-12-15T14:19:30  <Antimony> hows your bot doing?

2011-12-15T14:29:17  <BenJackson> crap, I was doing pretty well in that game

2011-12-15T14:29:33  <Wraithan> I got started late in the comp
2011-12-15T14:29:36  <Wraithan> :/
2011-12-15T14:29:43  <Wraithan> I am around 1300 with a pretty dumb bot though
2011-12-15T14:29:49  <rwest> there is nothing that should time out on those maps though
2011-12-15T14:30:00  <rwest> they are tiny and my bot only cares about map size
2011-12-15T14:30:08  <rwest> in regards to computation tim
2011-12-15T14:30:09  <rwest> e
2011-12-15T14:30:54  <BenJackson> last time I had an Official timeout I measured at home and that turn should have taken about 100ms
2011-12-15T14:30:58  <BenJackson> and earlier turns had taken 5x lnoger
2011-12-15T14:31:39  <yoden-cloud> the workers seems somewhat uneven in terms of performance

2011-12-15T14:34:55  <ChrisH_> janzert: Maybe it's just dumb luck, but my last few submissions seem to get a lot of 1v1 matchups against bots with much lower mu while they are climbing the ladder. My last game was 81.29 mu vs. 71.00 mu.
2011-12-15T14:35:05  <BenJackson> my ants get increasingly suicidal as I go over 200 and 250 ants

2011-12-15T14:35:20  <BenJackson> plus in most games without multi-hill it's hard to spawn too many ants
2011-12-15T14:35:31  <BenJackson> by the time you dominate enough to get that much food there aren't enough turns left

2011-12-15T14:35:43  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: same happened to me
2011-12-15T14:35:51  <BenJackson> I think what's happening is that we're not the seeds in those games
2011-12-15T14:36:12  <BenJackson> but when you get pulled into a game it uses up your queue position (afaict)
2011-12-15T14:36:47  <ChrisH_> well that's bad because those games always happen when I am at the front of the queue (as far as I can tell).
2011-12-15T14:37:01  <ChrisH_> so it's not like they are bonus games
2011-12-15T14:37:08  <BenJackson> someone explained that by the fact that bots near your skill are also at the front of the queue at the same time
2011-12-15T14:37:19  <BenJackson> it took me a lot more games to rank up this time
2011-12-15T14:37:30  <BenJackson> normally I win like 4-5 in a row and hit some competition
2011-12-15T14:37:35  <BenJackson> this time I won like 11 or 12 in a row
2011-12-15T14:37:54  <ChrisH_> I think it has to do with some changes to the matchup in which I think they loosened the requirements in some way, but that's just a suspicion

2011-12-15T14:38:33  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: the one that really gets me is the one where I beat GreenTea, but he was also climbing (and below me) so it didn't count for anything
2011-12-15T14:40:05  <BenJackson> as usual though I've got a new version before my old one is even stabilized
2011-12-15T14:40:12  <BenJackson> I'll probably resubmit tonight after reviewing fluxid results
2011-12-15T14:40:25  <ChrisH_> I suspect it has to do with how the queue goes in waves with sections of the queue dominated by similar mu's, but if you're toward one end of the wave perhaps all the good matchups have played too recently to get another game so you get stuck with poorer matchup
2011-12-15T14:40:42  <mcstar> (didnt, i meant to write didnt jesus h christ)
2011-12-15T14:41:43  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: then you get a good matchup and it's a multi-hill maze

2011-12-15T16:01:55  <mcstar> i cant stand c anymore for example, since i started to pay attention to programming im looking for really high level languages
2011-12-15T16:02:03  <Minthos> only in retrospect
2011-12-15T16:02:07  <ChrisH_> mcstar: we weren't "putting up" with them, they were cooler than anything else available

2011-12-15T16:02:47  <mcstar> probably its stupid hearing it from me
2011-12-15T16:02:50  <Minthos> early computers could do things that had seemed impossible only a few years earlier
2011-12-15T16:02:57  <ChrisH_> no I couldn't, my brain was prewired to do this stuff
2011-12-15T16:03:07  <Minthos> in retrospect they seem primitive, but at the time they were amazing
2011-12-15T16:03:20  <mcstar> ok
2011-12-15T16:03:24  <mcstar> i dont disagree
2011-12-15T16:03:40  <mcstar> but nowadays you arent "uncomfortable" with the system
2011-12-15T16:03:50  <mcstar> its pretty easy to do anything
2011-12-15T16:03:51  <ChrisH_> yeah, imagine when I moved from 1K of memory to owning a computer with 64K, that was a 64 times improvement in only a couple years.
2011-12-15T16:03:51  <Minthos> yes I am
2011-12-15T16:04:07  <Minthos> I just started in a job where I have to use windows in my daily work
2011-12-15T16:04:11  <Minthos> *shudder*
2011-12-15T16:04:24  <mcstar> and back than, that increased amount of hardware capacity really meant something
2011-12-15T16:04:31  <mcstar> but today, it doesn mean that much
2011-12-15T16:04:50  <pairofdice> Yeah a measly doubling every 18 months... pff!

2011-12-15T16:09:22  <Minthos> they were improving just as quickly 50 years ago
2011-12-15T16:09:38  <BenJackson> that was before I had a computer
2011-12-15T16:09:42  <BenJackson> so I'd write programs on the typewriter

2011-12-15T16:13:56  <BenJackson> so it has some improvements but the new code is even crazier than the old code
2011-12-15T16:14:31  <BenJackson> also I think the version running on fluxid has some kind of west-going bias due to my ultra hackish last-minute diffusion of one of my goal maps

2011-12-15T16:15:17  <ChrisH_> Well, I hope my V8 on the main server does well, because I like how it should work in theory, and what I've got on Fluxid is a slight generalization of that. I think I've got a couple mor things to try and maybe some speed profiling to do before finals.

2011-12-15T16:35:07  <Fluxid> mcstar: what, again
2011-12-15T16:35:15  <mcstar> what, again
2011-12-15T16:35:28  <Fluxid> yeah, there is something broken in the code
2011-12-15T16:35:34  <BenJackson> Fluxid has a data integrity problem
2011-12-15T16:35:44  <mcstar> i cant see anyone's listing
2011-12-15T16:35:48  <g0llum> mcstar, there was some reset yesterday, games got deleted
2011-12-15T16:35:49  <BenJackson> oh no
2011-12-15T16:35:58  <BenJackson> I actually NEED those fluxid games this time
2011-12-15T16:36:09  <mcstar> but it says i played 71 games
2011-12-15T16:36:19  <mcstar> so the counter isnt reset?
2011-12-15T16:36:24  <BenJackson> mcstar: games were definitely dropped without resetting the summary
2011-12-15T16:36:33  <BenJackson> but that was yesterday
2011-12-15T16:36:34  <mcstar> damn

2011-12-15T16:46:17  <mcstar> the weird thing is that i just played there ~30min ago, i had a timeout, but i still cant see the game
2011-12-15T16:46:21  <g0llum> you got purged, because you were away.

2011-12-15T16:53:39  <mcstar> they had a pneumonia shot infected with a retorvirus when they were young, a common side effect was that those children exhibited enhanced abilities with digital systems

2011-12-15T16:55:00  <Fluxid> mcstar: lol
2011-12-15T16:55:33  <a1k0n> i will treasure this game always: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=243931&user=432
2011-12-15T16:56:01  <a1k0n> but i guess staying alive while not always being in 1st place is a better strategy
2011-12-15T16:56:20  <Fluxid> Gnome: i've started programming in visualbasic in elementary school, in middle school learned it more, in highschool played with pascal and php and in uni java, c, prolog, python, and now working with python full-time: banking systems and financial stuff
2011-12-15T16:57:02  <Antimony> I started with visual basic as a kid, and then taught myself C++ in highschool
2011-12-15T16:57:07  <Antimony> and later Python
2011-12-15T16:57:13  <a1k0n> visual basic.  pah, basic wasn't visual in my day
2011-12-15T16:57:27  <mcstar> why is it visual???
2011-12-15T16:57:40  <mcstar> cause you can make a gui with it?
2011-12-15T16:57:44  <Gnome> That's cool, Fluxid, how is your bot doing in this challenge?
2011-12-15T16:57:52  <Fluxid> a1k0n: actually i started with qbasic in msdos 6
2011-12-15T16:57:54  <a1k0n> plus it doesn't have line numbers
2011-12-15T16:58:02  <a1k0n> msdos 6?!
2011-12-15T16:58:09  <Fluxid> but then i've got visual basic 5 for CHRISTMAS
2011-12-15T16:58:11  <a1k0n> nice.
2011-12-15T16:58:17  <Fluxid> best christmas ever, i'm telling you

2011-12-15T16:58:36  <thestinger> hi
2011-12-15T16:58:43  <a1k0n> i had the ROM basic on a TRS-80 CoCo.  until we got a 286 when i was in middle school where i could use GW-BASIC for DOS 3.3.
2011-12-15T16:58:50  <mcstar> thestinger: i know, i used it
2011-12-15T16:59:00  <mcstar> i just dont get the "visual" adjective
2011-12-15T16:59:03  <thestinger> it's probably just their crappy visual studio branding
2011-12-15T16:59:03  <Fluxid> mcstar: yeah, guis and stuff, and OO
2011-12-15T16:59:09  <thestinger> visual C++, etc.
2011-12-15T16:59:22  <Fluxid> well, visual c++ also had gui editor..
2011-12-15T16:59:25  <mcstar> k, but its just stupid advertising idiom
2011-12-15T16:59:27  <Fluxid> but then they went full retard
2011-12-15T16:59:31  <a1k0n> my best christmas ever was when i got a cassette recorder for my TRS-80 so i could actually save/load my programs
2011-12-15T16:59:31  <thestinger> https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express

2011-12-15T17:09:16  <BenJackson> but most of the important things I learned were from practical experience and not the classroom

2011-12-15T17:10:33  <mcstar> mit decided to teach 6.01, and switched from scheme to python

2011-12-15T17:11:20  <BenJackson> I had an ai book when I was a kid
2011-12-15T17:11:30  <BenJackson> but I didn't really grok it beyond writing a tic-tac-toe game
2011-12-15T17:11:52  <BenJackson> I did a lot of graphics hacking on my c64
2011-12-15T17:11:56  <BenJackson> and wrote/ran a bbs for years
2011-12-15T17:12:15  <mcstar> like a character from Hackers
2011-12-15T17:12:19  <BenJackson> I still think people should learn to program on something like a C64
2011-12-15T17:13:56  <BenJackson> Gnome: it was actually lego mindstorms (which I got as part of a LEGO revival when I realized I could afford all the LEGO I wanted)
2011-12-15T17:14:08  <BenJackson> that got me interested in "real life" AI
2011-12-15T17:14:17  <BenJackson> I'd written so many programs where the inputs were "known"
2011-12-15T17:14:32  <BenJackson> trying to write a program with incomplete, incorrect, misleading information was interesting
2011-12-15T17:14:49  <BenJackson> then I entered the 1998 (?) ICFP pousse contest

2011-12-15T17:16:59  <yoden-cloud_> i've been wanting to try for so long, so i had to do ants
2011-12-15T17:17:06  <ChrisH_> the best defense is a good offense.  :)
2011-12-15T17:17:40  <Gnome> I've been trying to find a community that does these types of puzzles frequently. I think ants is an awesome challenge.
2011-12-15T17:17:49  <BenJackson> I found the web page for the winning pousse entry
2011-12-15T17:17:53  <BenJackson> keep in mind, 3 days
2011-12-15T17:17:56  <BenJackson> I was working alone
2011-12-15T17:18:09  <ChrisH_> I used to put up a ring of ants around my hill that expanded depending on how many ants I had and how close the enemy was, but now I just go right at them and attack the enemy ants to keep them out of my territory.
2011-12-15T17:18:09  <Gnome> Yeah that would be tough man, how did you end up doing?
2011-12-15T17:18:18  <BenJackson> the winners were a HD sophomore, a MIT sophomore, 2 grad students, a research scientist, two professors and a system administrator

2011-12-15T17:19:00  <Garf> yeah, but for this to work you have to make a call how many ants to leave behind
2011-12-15T17:19:04  <BenJackson> V12 is about doing that more proactively
2011-12-15T17:19:20  <Garf> thats very tricky. too few and you get killed. too little and you can't eat food fast enough and get strategically lost
2011-12-15T17:19:21  <BenJackson> which it does so well that none of my personal test bots usually even find my hill
2011-12-15T17:19:24  <ChrisH_> That was what put my V5 into the top 5, now a lot more people are doing it too.
2011-12-15T17:19:29  <Gnome> ChrisH_ I was thinking of your original strategy as well. Did it not work as well as just straight up offense?
2011-12-15T17:19:50  <yoden-cloud_> defending is a waste of ants
2011-12-15T17:19:54  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: yeah, I would say that after combat defined the top tier it is being redefined by strategy again
2011-12-15T17:20:13  <BenJackson> OH and V12 solves (I think!) the rotating combat problem
2011-12-15T17:20:24  <ChrisH_> Gnome: the problem was it was just too inefficient, it let the enemy get too close and the ants on defense were frequently defending against nothing in one or more directions.

2011-12-15T17:21:30  <Antimony> now they're too scared to attack enemies until it's too late
2011-12-15T17:21:33  <ChrisH_> Think of this:  You shouldn't defend your hills, you should defend your feeding grounds around your hill to preserve exclusive access to the biggest food supply possible.
2011-12-15T17:21:54  <pairofdice> Yeah, a continuous perimeter you have visuals on
2011-12-15T17:22:10  <ChrisH_> And if there is no enemy in sight, then move farther out.
2011-12-15T17:22:23  <ChrisH_> When you make contact with the enemy you need good combat.
2011-12-15T17:22:54  <ChrisH_> Then it becomes a matter of who can resupply their lines the fastest with the most ants, or who can out flank the other.

2011-12-15T17:23:43  <BenJackson> the final announce only goes to 3rd place
2011-12-15T17:24:05  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I would argue that it's who can resupply their lines most efficiently
2011-12-15T17:24:08  <BenJackson> that's what xathis is crazy good at
2011-12-15T17:24:33  <Antimony> one thing I'm wondering about. Do you intentionally create a grid of ants to watch every square?
2011-12-15T17:24:35  <ChrisH_> I think that's just two words for the same thing.
2011-12-15T17:24:36  <Antimony> xathis appears to
2011-12-15T17:25:01  <Garf> I do this, but I'm having problems routing ants to it (timeouts)
2011-12-15T17:25:23  <Garf> if it works, it produces setups similar to xathis
2011-12-15T17:25:49  <BenJackson> my V11 sometimes gets surprised by ants and has to push them back
2011-12-15T17:25:55  <Garf> there's also issues in maps with lots of water
2011-12-15T17:25:59  <BenJackson> also it sometimes values slipping combat ants past the combat
2011-12-15T17:26:02  <BenJackson> when they should be defending
2011-12-15T17:26:05  <Garf> was it gets tricky to determine where to put the grid
2011-12-15T17:26:18  <BenJackson> V12 is better at being in the right place at the right time
2011-12-15T17:26:21  <BenJackson> and holding the line
2011-12-15T17:26:39  <BenJackson> Antimony: I intentionally maximize visibility as one factor in moving ants
2011-12-15T17:27:04  <BenJackson> although you have to turn that off early
2011-12-15T17:27:35  <yoden-cloud_> when do you turn it off? i only try to expand vis if nothing better to do :P
2011-12-15T17:27:49  <yoden-cloud_> which will probably be much less effective once I have real combat logic~~
2011-12-15T17:28:02  <BenJackson> I have a sliding scale of bonus for exploring that's so high initially that it swamps maintaining visibility
2011-12-15T17:28:08  <BenJackson> because you really need your first ants to get out fast

2011-12-15T17:28:24  <BenJackson> you need the initial chokepoints to form as far away from you as possible
2011-12-15T17:28:25  <yoden-cloud_> ah
2011-12-15T17:28:28  <yoden-cloud_> yeah
2011-12-15T17:28:36  <BenJackson> a few steps can be the difference between needing to hold a 20 ant wide wall and a 4 ant wide wall
2011-12-15T17:28:56  <BenJackson> and like chrish said I've scrapped all "defense"
2011-12-15T17:29:04  <BenJackson> defense is not letting you anywhere near my hill
2011-12-15T17:30:01  <ChrisH_> Here is a fun game to watch in which my bot and pguillory's form a huge line of battle between our territories before his bigger army eventually overwhelms me.  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=238002&user=10
2011-12-15T17:32:01  <BenJackson> there's one of my recent games including pguillory where at least 3 times I have him pinned with a defensive line and then we twist sideways and I let him by
2011-12-15T17:32:05  <BenJackson> and then pick him up with a new line
2011-12-15T17:32:07  <BenJackson> and repeat
2011-12-15T17:32:11  <BenJackson> hopefully V12 does not do that
2011-12-15T17:33:21  <yoden-cloud_> i love when a bot breaks a defensive line
2011-12-15T17:33:24  <yoden-cloud_> and tons of ants die for free
2011-12-15T17:33:29  <yoden-cloud_> feels like real strategy then :D
2011-12-15T17:33:58  <ChrisH_> I experimented with some changes to my pathing to combat in V6 and it was worse, so V7 restored my V5 behavior, but with a few bug fixes. Like you said earlier BenJackson I've been improving (hopefully) my strategic planning in the last couple versions.
2011-12-15T17:34:51  <mcstar> i only have 1 version
2011-12-15T17:35:48  <mcstar> ah
2011-12-15T17:35:52  <mcstar> i wanted to ask
2011-12-15T17:36:09  <mcstar> do you guys write your bots in an object oriented fashion?
2011-12-15T17:36:21  <mcstar> most of you program in java/c++
2011-12-15T17:36:57  <yoden-cloud_> what constitutes object oriented?
2011-12-15T17:37:20  <mcstar> inheritance, polymorphism
2011-12-15T17:37:21  <kevlar_work> mcstar, mine is in Go, which is type oriented and has methods but isn't strictly OO
2011-12-15T17:37:22  <ChrisH_> I use Go, which is only partially OO, but I do not use those features much because most of my logic is just manipulating arrays of integers.
2011-12-15T17:37:22  <mcstar> somesuch
2011-12-15T17:37:28  <kevlar_work> ChrisH_, Hi!
2011-12-15T17:37:56  <ChrisH_> kevlar_work: hi
2011-12-15T17:37:59  <thestinger> mcstar: no inheritance, and the polymorphism comes from templates (so basically, just like type classes in haskell)
2011-12-15T17:38:03  <mcstar> i cant imagine doing my thing in a pure functional fashion
2011-12-15T17:38:14  <thestinger> I have lots of random objects but I'm mostly just using them as records
2011-12-15T17:38:22  <yoden-cloud_> there's not really a lot of need for polymorphism...
2011-12-15T17:38:32  <mcstar> im heavily using stl
2011-12-15T17:38:43  <yoden-cloud_> i do have a few interfaces for strategies and such
2011-12-15T17:39:12  <ChrisH_> for me an ant is usually just an integer (it's position on the map), and sometimes two integers (it's position and the turn that it is there).
2011-12-15T17:39:18  <mcstar> and all my algorithsm operate heavily on mutable data structures

2011-12-15T17:39:40  <ChrisH_> everything is about ants and turns, so OO isn't really applicable at that level
2011-12-15T17:40:05  <yoden> I do have a "tile" object, but that's mostly for my sanity
2011-12-15T17:40:28  <yoden> I copy the map state into int[]s for most calculations, so the algos aren't coupled to the map repr

2011-12-15T18:32:05  <meduza> janzert: but is there any workaround?
2011-12-15T18:33:50  <Antimony> is there anyway to automatically download replays and generate the input files ourselves?
2011-12-15T18:34:03  <antimatroid> Antimony: bot in button
2011-12-15T18:34:13  <Antimony> ?
2011-12-15T18:34:25  <antimatroid> on the rhs of the visualiser is a bot in button
2011-12-15T18:34:26  <antimatroid> use that
2011-12-15T18:34:46  <mcstar> "automatically"
2011-12-15T18:34:51  <antimatroid> oh
2011-12-15T18:34:56  <antimatroid> sorry :P
2011-12-15T18:35:14  <antimatroid> i think you'd have to automate that
2011-12-15T18:35:15  <Antimony> it only generates 1 input and it requires you to click through several dialogs
2011-12-15T18:35:24  <mcstar> antimatroid: using c++ or c++11?
2011-12-15T18:35:37  <antimatroid> c++11
2011-12-15T18:35:37  <Antimony> anything. I guess Python would probably be easies
2011-12-15T18:35:42  <mcstar> :)
2011-12-15T18:35:53  <antimatroid> gimme unordered_Set
2011-12-15T18:36:08  <Antimony> I should try switching to unordered set sometime and see if my bot gets any faster
2011-12-15T18:36:33  <antimatroid> you have to write an index function which is a bit of a pita
2011-12-15T18:36:45  <antimatroid> goes from like set<Location> to unordered_set<Location, LocationIndex>
2011-12-15T18:37:01  <antimatroid> i should really typedef locset
2011-12-15T18:37:01  <Antimony> no, you can override the hash function in teh std namespace
2011-12-15T18:37:04  <antimatroid> or something
2011-12-15T18:37:15  <Antimony> admittedly, doing so is also a PITA if you aren't in the global namespace
2011-12-15T18:37:31  <mcstar> what is?
2011-12-15T18:37:39  <Antimony> extending std::hash
2011-12-15T18:37:40  <antimatroid> can typedefs include template parameters?
2011-12-15T18:37:47  <mcstar> thats not a PITA
2011-12-15T18:37:51  <mcstar> thats easy as pie

2011-12-15T18:41:45  <Antimony> I used to, but it was hurting my bot

2011-12-15T18:42:06  <Antimony> technically, my bot doesn't even explore in the first place

2011-12-15T19:36:41  <kevlar_work> then all was good, the bots ate memory and the backup had the disk all to itself.

2011-12-15T19:37:58  <mcstar> when you run out of memory on linux it can be pretty severe
2011-12-15T19:38:14  <kevlar_work> this is mac os
2011-12-15T19:38:15  <mcstar> sometimes you dont have the time to switch to terminal and kill the app
2011-12-15T19:38:19  <mcstar> yeah
2011-12-15T19:38:30  <mcstar> i guess on that you have a bit more time
2011-12-15T19:38:54  <mcstar> when something eats up memory, i can no longer use X
2011-12-15T19:38:57  <kevlar_work> I think it's only because it takes apps longer to get ahold of the memory the system is keeping around as "inactive" instead of "free"
2011-12-15T19:39:39  <kevlar_work> presumably in case the original owner of the memory comes back for it or something, not sure.
2011-12-15T19:39:51  <kevlar_work> but yeah, X11 makes matters difficult
2011-12-15T19:39:53  <mcstar> i think theres some process priority differences between the two systems
2011-12-15T19:40:01  <kevlar_work> likely
2011-12-15T19:40:09  <mcstar> osx is very much graphical
2011-12-15T19:40:16  <kevlar_work> lol, yeah
2011-12-15T19:40:34  <mcstar> i mean Darwin is behind that, which is just a bsd, but still, aqua has high priority

2011-12-15T19:42:00  <mcstar> yes, its very much different
2011-12-15T19:42:26  <mcstar> different kernels, different philosophies, and different virtual memory systems
2011-12-15T19:42:34  <mcstar> im not familiar with the details either
2011-12-15T19:42:57  <mcstar> but i read up on it sometime ago, and maybe bsd felt more "thought out"
2011-12-15T19:45:13  <mcstar> i made my BSF faster
2011-12-15T19:45:24  <mcstar> at the cost of this memory error
2011-12-15T19:45:44  <mcstar> so most of the time its faster, but sometimes it never terminated

2011-12-15T20:18:16  <mcstar> i mean why does that matter?
2011-12-15T20:18:28  <kevlar_work> is your algorithm's complexity not based on how much of the board you have to consider?

2011-12-15T20:32:31  <BenJackson> thestinger: a transparent ploy to keep c++11 to yourself
2011-12-15T20:32:44  <thestinger> at least use a token lambda if you switch to C++11 xD
2011-12-15T20:32:50  <mcstar> LOLOLOLOL damn
2011-12-15T20:32:59  <BenJackson> no the delicious irony woudl be absolutely 0 c++11 features
2011-12-15T20:33:12  <mcstar> i noticed a 5 turn periodic increase in turntime
2011-12-15T20:33:12  <thestinger> I think it will use C++11 features anyway, it will be faster
2011-12-15T20:33:27  <thestinger> due to the new move semantics, etc.
2011-12-15T20:33:45  <mcstar> (its something that does something turn%5==0, damn)
2011-12-15T20:34:00  <BenJackson> maybe _flag will switch to C++11 but just keep using C
2011-12-15T20:34:27  <thestinger> then he'll have to add a bunch of casts to malloc() calls
2011-12-15T20:35:45  <BenJackson> he can just #define that
2011-12-15T20:35:46  <BenJackson> muahaha
2011-12-15T20:35:54  <antimatroid> the only c++11 thing i'm using is unordered_set i think ehe
2011-12-15T20:36:03  <thestinger> antimatroid: no 'auto'?
2011-12-15T20:36:05  <BenJackson> std::tr1 has unordered_set anyway
2011-12-15T20:36:11  <thestinger> yeah, tr1/unordered_set
2011-12-15T20:36:13  <antimatroid> nope?
2011-12-15T20:36:20  <antimatroid> i don't understand what auto does
2011-12-15T20:36:27  <thestinger> type inference
2011-12-15T20:36:33  <thestinger> like templates do
2011-12-15T20:36:35  <thestinger> but locally
2011-12-15T20:36:50  <BenJackson> antimatroid: auto it = my_vector.begin()
2011-12-15T20:37:00  <BenJackson> so you don't have to spell out vector<T>::iterator
2011-12-15T20:37:29  * antimatroid goes to try that out!
2011-12-15T20:37:53  <thestinger> the first C++11 feature I used was the right-angle bracket thing
2011-12-15T20:37:55  <thestinger> xD
2011-12-15T20:38:03  <mcstar> i told him that weeks before, never mind
2011-12-15T20:38:06  <thestinger> std::vector<std::vector<SomeType>>
2011-12-15T20:38:09  <mcstar> (auto)
2011-12-15T20:38:13  <thestinger> barely even a feature
2011-12-15T20:38:14  <antimatroid> mcstar: i'm terrible at these things :)
2011-12-15T20:38:36  <BenJackson> yeah, it really annoys me that most compilers can catch that >> now
2011-12-15T20:38:44  <BenJackson> but of course can't accept it if you're not in c++11 mode
2011-12-15T20:39:01  <thestinger> I use unordered_map and unordered_set a lot
2011-12-15T20:39:07  <mcstar> omg, 60 ants battle+pathfinding in 12ms
2011-12-15T20:39:09  <thestinger> because I'm used to coding in languages with those
2011-12-15T20:39:32  <thestinger> and lambdas/closures/higher-order functions
2011-12-15T20:39:49  <thestinger> even using lambdas just as nested functions to limit scope is nice
2011-12-15T20:40:12  <BenJackson> well I'm king of tcpants
2011-12-15T20:40:13  <mcstar> thestinger: whats wrong with {}?
2011-12-15T20:40:22  <thestinger> mcstar: I mean, the scope of functions
2011-12-15T20:40:30  <thestinger> instead of having 30 global functions
2011-12-15T20:40:48  <mcstar> hm
2011-12-15T20:40:58  <mcstar> i dont see what does "scope" has to do with it
2011-12-15T20:41:10  <mcstar> has->have
2011-12-15T20:41:32  <thestinger> well, I can define a little function nested inside another and use it 3 times - just makes the code easier to look over
2011-12-15T20:42:12  <mcstar> ok i get it
2011-12-15T20:42:16  <mcstar> i just dont see the scope
2011-12-15T20:42:21  <mcstar> you limit functionality
2011-12-15T20:42:23  <mcstar> and reuse that
2011-12-15T20:42:29  <mcstar> thats ok
2011-12-15T20:42:40  <mcstar> scope for me means "scope of a name"
2011-12-15T20:42:51  <thestinger> well, it does change the scope of the name
2011-12-15T20:42:52  <mcstar> but probably it can be applied in a broader sense
2011-12-15T20:42:57  <mcstar> im just not used to it
2011-12-15T20:43:05  <thestinger> there's something like 'get_nattackers' as a local variable, instead of a global function
2011-12-15T20:43:42  <thestinger> it's somewhat of an idiom in python to use lots of nested functions, even if you aren't using them as closures
2011-12-15T20:43:46  <thestinger> so I'm used to it
2011-12-15T20:44:08  <kevlar_work> I use closures a lot in my Go
2011-12-15T20:44:33  <mcstar> i just got to know recently that you can use continuations in c
2011-12-15T20:44:53  <thestinger> I also have lots of little anonymous functions (passing them as arguments to higher-order functions)
2011-12-15T20:45:02  <thestinger> the syntax is pretty ugly though
2011-12-15T20:46:29  <BenJackson> anyone know who Flower is on tcpants?
2011-12-15T20:46:55  <kevlar_work> (I just can't help reading that as T C Pants, lol)
2011-12-15T20:47:21  <antimatroid> kevlar_work: nobody can :)

2011-12-15T20:51:29  <thestinger> I think some bots are "cheating" the turntime
2011-12-15T20:51:35  <thestinger> and loadtime too probably
2011-12-15T20:51:46  <thestinger> you're told that 500ms is the turntime, but you get up to 5s
2011-12-15T20:51:51  <thestinger> my games can take 30-45 mins now
2011-12-15T20:52:02  <thestinger> I'm sure there are bots using more than 500ms, it's annoying as hell
2011-12-15T20:52:11  <thestinger> probably not intentional

2011-12-15T20:54:57  <antimatroid> but my bot thinks it returns within like 100-200ms so i'm not too worried
2011-12-15T20:54:57  <rwest_> I almost never time out on TCP

2011-12-15T20:56:53  <rwest_> So I am working on this puzzle for an inteview, I can't believe they give this shit for a web dev job hah
2011-12-15T20:57:07  <rwest_> has to compute in under a minute
2011-12-15T20:57:28  <deafferret> one minute? did you mean 1 second?
2011-12-15T20:57:34  <rwest_> I am raising a 36700x36700 matrix to the 10th power
2011-12-15T20:58:07  <deafferret> yikes
2011-12-15T20:58:09  <rwest_> and then summing the resulting values
2011-12-15T20:58:16  <rwest_> it supposed to fit in a 64-bit int
2011-12-15T20:58:18  <BenJackson> arbitrary matrix?  or one with tricks
2011-12-15T20:58:27  <rwest_> I have split it up
2011-12-15T20:58:30  <rwest_> into squares
2011-12-15T20:58:43  <rwest_> so I do A^2 x A^2 to get A^4
2011-12-15T20:58:45  <rwest_> and the like
2011-12-15T20:59:05  <mcstar> is it a dense matrix?
2011-12-15T20:59:07  <rwest_> hasn't even returned yet, gotta be like 10 min
2011-12-15T20:59:16  <rwest_> its an adjacentcy matrix
2011-12-15T20:59:24  <mcstar> oh
2011-12-15T20:59:26  <Antimony> is it diagonalizable?
2011-12-15T20:59:34  <mcstar> yep
2011-12-15T20:59:38  <rwest_> antimatroid: I highly doubt it
2011-12-15T20:59:38  <mcstar> i mean try that
2011-12-15T20:59:49  <rwest_> actuall let me look at my printed matrix
2011-12-15T20:59:52  <Antimony> there's got to be a trick. let me think about it
2011-12-15T20:59:59  <BenJackson> rwest_: is the matrix online?
2011-12-15T21:00:02  <BenJackson> now we all want to play
2011-12-15T21:00:14  <BenJackson> there are several techniques for faster matrix mul
2011-12-15T21:00:16  <rwest_> haha the matrix is just the solution I came up with
2011-12-15T21:00:22  <BenJackson> but the best ones only apply to certain kinds of matrices
2011-12-15T21:00:24  <antimatroid> there's a way to do something like that with the eigenvectors i think, but pita to get those
2011-12-15T21:00:37  <rwest_> sec I can dropbox the pdf
2011-12-15T21:00:41  <Antimony> Even with repetead squaring, 37600 row multiplication is slow
2011-12-15T21:00:45  <mcstar> gauss does it in n^3 i think
2011-12-15T21:00:48  <Antimony> I think the trick invovles taking advantage of the fact
2011-12-15T21:00:52  <BenJackson> I knew a very strange grad student who was obsessed with giant matrix mul
2011-12-15T21:00:54  <Antimony> that you only need the sum
2011-12-15T21:00:59  <BenJackson> and used early 64-proc parallel sun boxes to work on them

2011-12-15T21:01:34  <BenJackson> rwest_: you know about project euler?
2011-12-15T21:01:44  <mcstar> omg 1000 hits already
2011-12-15T21:01:46  <rwest_> it's actually a modified problem from project euler
2011-12-15T21:01:51  <thestinger> I did some of project euler when I first started programming
2011-12-15T21:02:03  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Lost terminal)
2011-12-15T21:02:07  <BenJackson> I did the first 25 or so project euler problems in shell (using bc and tail and stuff)
2011-12-15T21:02:08  <thestinger> tbh I didn't really like it, the problems required a tiny bit of code to solve so it wasn't really a good way to learn
2011-12-15T21:02:11  <rwest_> like problem 215
2011-12-15T21:02:16  <rwest_> I googled it haha
2011-12-15T21:02:19  <BenJackson> which worked because computers are so much more powerful than they scaled for when they made those up
2011-12-15T21:02:23  <rwest_> no real help beyond what I already have
2011-12-15T21:02:34  <rwest_> since I already had what people were hinting at
2011-12-15T21:02:51  <rwest_> I really think this is because I am using BigInteger in Java
2011-12-15T21:02:52  <rwest_> lol
2011-12-15T21:02:57  <rwest_> to sum it
2011-12-15T21:02:58  <mcstar> hm
2011-12-15T21:03:06  <rwest_> wtb uint64
2011-12-15T21:03:12  <mcstar> why 37600^2 matrix for that problem?
2011-12-15T21:03:30  <rwest_> because it's faster than brute forcing
2011-12-15T21:03:33  <rwest_> a lot faster
2011-12-15T21:03:33  <Antimony> I think you gave the wrong problem
2011-12-15T21:03:36  <Antimony> there's no matrix
2011-12-15T21:03:39  <mcstar> you gonna need some recursive alg or somesuch
2011-12-15T21:03:49  <rwest_> recursion is so slow on it
2011-12-15T21:03:58  <thestinger> BenJackson: http://projecteuler.net/profile/strcat.png that's how far I got when I was using it to learn python :)
2011-12-15T21:04:01  <mcstar> make it TCO
2011-12-15T21:04:12  <rwest_> Antimony: I use an adjacency matrix for the different rows of blocks
2011-12-15T21:04:23  <thestinger> I ended up getting stuck on some problems though due to speed issues and gave up
2011-12-15T21:04:23  <rwest_> so I only calculate whether they can stack once
2011-12-15T21:04:41  <rwest_> then if I raise the matrix to the power of height -1
2011-12-15T21:04:47  <rwest_> I get the number of walls I can build
2011-12-15T21:04:55  <Antimony> well you should have said that then
2011-12-15T21:05:06  <rwest_> I was building a graph
2011-12-15T21:05:09  <Antimony> there could be a shortcut that doesn't involve huge matrices
2011-12-15T21:05:18  <BenJackson> this reeks of a dynamic programming problem
2011-12-15T21:05:21  <rwest_> and the shortcut to the graph was the matrix
2011-12-15T21:05:28  <rwest_> and from here I am stuck
2011-12-15T21:05:30  <BenJackson> I'm really bad at spotting the recurrence relations in DP though
2011-12-15T21:05:43  <rwest_> I am about to switch to C so I can have 64 bit ints
2011-12-15T21:05:45  <BenJackson> but I try to be alert to the possibility because if it is DP then it is usually really fast
2011-12-15T21:05:57  <rwest_> they say 0.1s in C
2011-12-15T21:06:02  <rwest_> I can't really see how
2011-12-15T21:06:21  <Antimony> you're probably doing it wrong
2011-12-15T21:06:30  <rwest_> Antimony: that would be my guess lol
2011-12-15T21:06:38  <thestinger> -floop-parallelize-all :P
2011-12-15T21:06:41  <rwest_> I get all the right answers for the example answers shown
2011-12-15T21:07:04  <rwest_> I should just run it on the cluster at work
2011-12-15T21:07:48  <BenJackson> precompute the table
2011-12-15T21:07:53  <Antimony> I don't get the problem
2011-12-15T21:08:05  <Antimony> I can't find any interpertation that gives the numbers they have
2011-12-15T21:08:09  <BenJackson> 10 possible heights, 96 (or less) possible widths
2011-12-15T21:08:14  <thestinger> ok, I'm going to have to write something to figure out which bots are using like 4s a turn
2011-12-15T21:08:18  <BenJackson> table of 960 int64
2011-12-15T21:08:19  <BenJackson> done
2011-12-15T21:08:26  <BenJackson> thestinger: M24 is at the top of my list
2011-12-15T21:08:28  <rwest_> BenJackson: hahah
2011-12-15T21:08:42  <BenJackson> I'd hire someone who presented me with the right table
2011-12-15T21:08:48  <BenJackson> 960 is not too big for a lookup table
2011-12-15T21:08:53  <BenJackson> probably smaller than the code to compute it
2011-12-15T21:09:22  <rwest_> BenJackson: the possible block combos for width 48 is 37500ish
2011-12-15T21:09:38  <BenJackson> that's a number IN the table
2011-12-15T21:09:38  <Antimony> how the heck do you even get 2 for 7.5x1?
2011-12-15T21:09:48  <BenJackson> Antimony: 3 first, 3 second
2011-12-15T21:10:01  <BenJackson> I thik that's given to answer questions about symmetry
2011-12-15T21:10:01  <mcstar> interchange the rectangles
2011-12-15T21:10:03  <rwest_> 4.5,3 and 3,4.5
2011-12-15T21:10:05  <Antimony> oops
2011-12-15T21:10:14  <Antimony> I was thinking of blocks that are 1x1 and 1.5x1
2011-12-15T21:10:16  <BenJackson> oh yeah and step 1 I'd factor out the 1.5 and solve for 3, 2
2011-12-15T21:10:16  <Antimony> nvm
2011-12-15T21:10:23  <Antimony> me too
2011-12-15T21:10:31  <Antimony> I just accidently factored by .5 isntead of 1.5
2011-12-15T21:10:54  <thestinger> BenJackson:   dabino_sym (9)    bugnutsv6 (2)    strcat (2)    sevik_v25c (0)    sevik_v25c_1 (0)    SFX_BotV1 (0)    rebelxt16 (0)
2011-12-15T21:10:59  <thestinger> that game took 2.7s per turn
2011-12-15T21:11:03  <thestinger> etc
2011-12-15T21:11:10  <thestinger> I'll just write a script to figure out which bots do it
2011-12-15T21:11:11  <BenJackson> how do you get duration?
2011-12-15T21:11:23  <thestinger> well, there's a column with the # of turns
2011-12-15T21:11:28  <BenJackson> I only notice M24 by seeing turns go by in my game until he timed out
2011-12-15T21:11:31  <BenJackson> and then it took off
2011-12-15T21:11:33  <thestinger> I'm assuming I get a game again right away (I pretty much always do)

2011-12-15T21:11:42  <BenJackson> also M24 is pretty good but I don't know who that is on aichallenge
2011-12-15T21:11:48  <rwest_> first thing I do is get the planks with certain numbers of blocks, then I get all permutations of each plank
2011-12-15T21:11:50  <BenJackson> but with 2+ seconds of cpu time maybe he's not that good
2011-12-15T21:12:01  <rwest_> for the 48 width
2011-12-15T21:12:05  <rwest_> that is like .1s
2011-12-15T21:12:19  <BenJackson> ohh that's your adjacency matrix
2011-12-15T21:12:20  <thestinger> meh, I'm too lazy to deal with html atm
2011-12-15T21:12:24  <thestinger> I'll just do this by hand xD
2011-12-15T21:12:24  <BenJackson> you're finding all the possible rows
2011-12-15T21:12:28  <rwest_> yes
2011-12-15T21:12:28  <BenJackson> and trying to find out how they could stack up
2011-12-15T21:12:41  <rwest_> so that info is only calculated once
2011-12-15T21:13:03  <BenJackson> well the left and right edges have to alternate
2011-12-15T21:13:08  <rwest_> yes
2011-12-15T21:13:12  <rwest_> that is my first drop out
2011-12-15T21:13:40  <rwest_> calculating the first matrix takes around 1s
2011-12-15T21:13:44  <rwest_> under 2s
2011-12-15T21:13:47  <rwest_> under 1s
2011-12-15T21:13:48  <rwest_> err
2011-12-15T21:13:54  <BenJackson> what's your representation of the matrix?
2011-12-15T21:13:59  <rwest_> array
2011-12-15T21:14:11  <thestinger> BenJackson: nvm, I think tcp just eats games
2011-12-15T21:14:20  <thestinger> game 35972: survived score: 21 turn: 562
2011-12-15T21:14:25  <thestinger> that was the last game strcat_next played
2011-12-15T21:14:34  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_next nowhere to be seen

2011-12-15T21:14:54  <thestinger> can't really figure out the duration of games if some don't show up
2011-12-15T21:15:00  <BenJackson> I need to analyze my v12 games and resubmit before fluxid fully implodes
2011-12-15T21:15:10  <thestinger> I think it did
2011-12-15T21:15:16  <thestinger> I'm sure my last 10 or so games haven't shown up
2011-12-15T21:15:18  <thestinger> :\
2011-12-15T21:15:33  <antimatroid> Fluxid: we need you :P

2011-12-15T21:16:14  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_stupid for example, this bot has been playing games

2011-12-15T21:16:36  <thestinger> but it has been playing nonstop
2011-12-15T21:16:39  <janzert> BenJackson: http://pastebin.com/iGbXHzJr top 20 mu
2011-12-15T21:17:18  <BenJackson> janzert: I think we can rule out xathis as a mathematical anomaly
2011-12-15T21:17:21  <BenJackson> all in favor??
2011-12-15T21:17:25  <rwest_> lol
2011-12-15T21:17:28  <janzert> hehe
2011-12-15T21:17:44  <thestinger> I had 91.75 before I reuploaded - I think it's more packed at the top than we think
2011-12-15T21:17:48  <thestinger> because people keep reuploading
2011-12-15T21:17:49  <janzert> toss out the outlier
2011-12-15T21:17:56  <BenJackson> well good news is I'm solidly in the top 20
2011-12-15T21:18:01  <BenJackson> now to try to get solidly in the top 10
2011-12-15T21:18:03  <thestinger> BenJackson: maybe :P
2011-12-15T21:18:14  <antimatroid> i bet there's at least 30 people who feel that way
2011-12-15T21:18:28  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=4622
2011-12-15T21:18:33  <thestinger> lots of bots like that are climbing back up
2011-12-15T21:18:34  <rwest_> 11 million BigInteger calls
2011-12-15T21:18:35  <rwest_> lol
2011-12-15T21:18:38  <rwest_> that has to be it
2011-12-15T21:18:39  <BenJackson> well I've been inching my way up, losing ground to other bots' improvements but gaining with my own
2011-12-15T21:18:41  <antimatroid> fourmidable isn't listed there
2011-12-15T21:19:57  <antimatroid> thestinger: a couple of games just turned up for me
2011-12-15T21:20:26  <thestinger> were you eliminated in them? those don't show up write away until they finish
2011-12-15T21:20:31  <thestinger> right away*
2011-12-15T21:20:43  <rwest_> fuck it, back to ants
2011-12-15T21:20:59  <antimatroid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.35902 bloody timeouts aha
2011-12-15T21:21:08  <antimatroid> thestinger: yeah i timed out in both
2011-12-15T21:21:18  <antimatroid> i know i have to wait, just noting that games did indeed turn up
2011-12-15T21:21:58  <thestinger> I'm keeping a list of games that get finished, and some never turn up (I'm just looking at the ones with 'survived' to make it simple)
2011-12-15T21:22:20  <mcstar> rwest_: how much time do you have to solve the problem?
2011-12-15T21:22:43  <mcstar> *are you given*
2011-12-15T21:22:52  <rwest_> mcstar: at least until monday, but I have like 3 other places I have to visit with next week anyway
2011-12-15T21:23:32  <mcstar> there is a similar PE problem, my friend couldnt solve it in 2 days
2011-12-15T21:23:46  <rwest_> I know there is
2011-12-15T21:23:47  <mcstar> he is a graduated mathematician
2011-12-15T21:23:49  <rwest_> I found it

2011-12-15T21:24:21  <antimatroid> i'm hoping to avoid job hunting for the moment
2011-12-15T21:24:26  <antimatroid> but that depends on getting phd funding
2011-12-15T21:24:42  <mcstar> the moment the contest is over, im gonna apply to ericsson
2011-12-15T21:24:42  <rwest_> jobs in the Boston area are so plentiful
2011-12-15T21:24:57  <antimatroid> i have to move to get a job
2011-12-15T21:25:04  <antimatroid> there's no decent jobs in tasmania
2011-12-15T21:25:12  <mcstar> fishing?
2011-12-15T21:25:15  <rwest_> well for Software Engineering
2011-12-15T21:25:15  <antimatroid> lol
2011-12-15T21:25:25  <janzert> antimatroid: just means you have to create your own
2011-12-15T21:25:47  <antimatroid> janzert: :P, i'm going to try and weasel my way into the algo trading industry if i have to get a job
2011-12-15T21:25:47  <janzert> there's this great thing called the internet will let you reach a global customer base too ;)
2011-12-15T21:25:55  <antimatroid> and that means going to sydney
2011-12-15T21:26:14  <janzert> ahh, yeah I imagine there's not a big industry in tasmania for that :)
2011-12-15T21:26:46  <antimatroid> plus my best bet for a programming type job would be graduatish because my programming skills aren't very good
2011-12-15T21:26:58  <antimatroid> i'm going to spend a bit of time in january learning how to use stuff like debuggers etc. properly
2011-12-15T21:27:06  <antimatroid> and git
2011-12-15T21:27:39  <antimatroid> but hopefully i can delay this for another 3-4 years :P
2011-12-15T21:27:55  <antimatroid> the job part, still going to do the learning /rambling
2011-12-15T21:28:00  <janzert> :)
2011-12-15T21:28:31  <thestinger> antimatroid: you can learn git in 15 mins :)
2011-12-15T21:28:55  <antimatroid> yeah well, better
2011-12-15T21:28:58  <thestinger> if the debugger is gdb, then good luck xD
2011-12-15T21:29:01  <antimatroid> and i want to learn how to use linux better
2011-12-15T21:29:23  <thestinger> install Arch or Gentoo, sure way to learn lots of stuff
2011-12-15T21:29:34  <thestinger> you'll break stuff and have to learn tons to fix it
2011-12-15T21:29:56  <rwest_> http://tcpants.com/replay.1343
2011-12-15T21:29:57  <antimatroid> i suspect i'm still too much of a newb to be able to do that
2011-12-15T21:30:03  <rwest_> all I ever do on that map is build walls
2011-12-15T21:30:13  <thestinger> antimatroid: you can definitely install Arch, there's an awesome Beginners' Guide
2011-12-15T21:30:29  <thestinger> you can just install it in virtualbox and have it open in a browser
2011-12-15T21:31:13  <thestinger> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide
2011-12-15T21:31:15  <antimatroid> i shall do that in the new year
2011-12-15T21:32:07  <thestinger> and then stuff like compiling a kernel can be fun
2011-12-15T21:32:23  <thestinger> easier than learning C++ because there are actually nice docs :P
2011-12-15T21:32:51  <antimatroid> i mostly just learn c++ on a need to use basis
2011-12-15T21:33:02  <antimatroid> i need to do something and ask people how i do it
2011-12-15T21:33:06  <thestinger> yeah, that's pretty much how I learned Linux stuff
2011-12-15T21:33:12  <antimatroid> hence i don't actually know how to properly describe stuff :P
2011-12-15T21:33:22  <thestinger> I just installed Arch as my first distro, and had to learn everything
2011-12-15T21:34:23  <mcstar> im going to give haskell a spin
2011-12-15T21:34:32  <mcstar> i was looking into functinal languages for some time
2011-12-15T21:34:46  <mcstar> i messed with ocaml, and f# i didnt like it
2011-12-15T21:34:49  <mcstar> only haskell remained
2011-12-15T21:35:02  <mcstar> and i wanna be better at lisp too
2011-12-15T21:35:29  <mcstar> antimatroid: you should try haskell
2011-12-15T21:35:41  <antimatroid> yeah haskell still interests me, but it's way lower on the to learn list than it used to be
2011-12-15T21:36:03  <antimatroid> i wish c++ had haskells type system
2011-12-15T21:36:05  <mcstar> you place stuff like git and linux above it?
2011-12-15T21:36:15  <antimatroid> more practical for the moment
2011-12-15T21:36:38  <thestinger> algebraic data types are so nice
2011-12-15T21:36:55  <mcstar> haskell has type classes
2011-12-15T21:36:58  <mcstar> really ncie
2011-12-15T21:36:59  <antimatroid> i know
2011-12-15T21:37:16  <mcstar> i wrote my new alg in it
2011-12-15T21:37:23  <mcstar> the one that will improve my battle

2011-12-15T21:42:55  <thestinger> Real World Haskell is a good follow up to that
2011-12-15T21:43:10  <thestinger> I haven't actually finished it yet

2011-12-15T21:43:47  <thestinger> learn you a haskell takes like a day though
2011-12-15T21:44:05  <thestinger> it covers the basics of everything really quickly which is nice, because you can just start making haskell programs
2011-12-15T21:44:29  <mcstar> im at recursion

2011-12-15T22:14:38  <mcstar> teams can participate
2011-12-15T22:14:47  <mcstar> there were some who asked
2011-12-15T22:14:53  <mcstar> so there are teams out there
2011-12-15T22:15:04  <antimatroid> how do people spread their ants out?
2011-12-15T22:15:16  <mcstar> i think it should be noted on the profile page though
2011-12-15T22:15:30  <thestinger> antimatroid: non-visible locations are used as targets to look for food (not just unseen ones)
2011-12-15T22:16:09  <antimatroid> thestinger: but what about like when you have heaps of vision?
2011-12-15T22:16:20  <antimatroid> presumably you want to spread your ants out to minimise food collection time
2011-12-15T22:16:40  <thestinger> well, I only send 1 ant to an area for that
2011-12-15T22:16:50  <thestinger> so they spread out and cover the map if possible
2011-12-15T22:16:50  <antimatroid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=246776&user=4513
2011-12-15T22:16:54  <antimatroid> watch that xathis game
2011-12-15T22:16:58  <antimatroid> he maximises visibility
2011-12-15T22:17:22  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=245863&user=2255
2011-12-15T22:17:29  <thestinger> my ants usually spread out and cover a lot of the map
2011-12-15T22:17:45  <thestinger> I don't directly control it, it's emergent due to how goals are weighted for finding food
2011-12-15T22:18:05  <thestinger> like, they won't turn around and go back to the hill at the beginning
2011-12-15T22:18:27  <thestinger> because unseen locations are weighted more than tiles they could see last turn, or a few turns ago
2011-12-15T22:18:33  <Darhuuk_> rwest_: in case you are still online & looking for a solution to your programming problem, a friend & me once spend 3 days on it with little sleep, you can do it insanely quickly using graphs & pathfinding.

2011-12-15T22:19:17  <thestinger> spreading out to look for food is one of the few things I have working well :P
2011-12-15T22:20:39  <thestinger> I can beat bots with better combat only because I find more food
2011-12-15T22:22:25  <thestinger> the lambda I pass into my BFS to make the gradient map for finding food (spreading out basically) records the distance to a target, and the location of that target

2011-12-15T22:22:49  <mcstar> i have the solution right here
2011-12-15T22:23:01  <mcstar> but i cant formalize it for the computer
2011-12-15T22:23:12  <mcstar> its 4:23
2011-12-15T22:24:03  <thestinger> anyway, it just took a lot of trial and error and random tuning to get spreading to work
2011-12-15T22:24:40  <thestinger> I've tried adding on territory control (ants are attracted to the borders I control to fight enemies), but my combat isn't good enough to make it work
2011-12-15T22:24:56  <thestinger> so my foragers just have to hope the enemy doesn't hunt them down atm

2011-12-15T22:26:38  <mcstar> Darhuuk_: you make all the possible lists of 3 and 4.5 that adds up to N, after that you sum of those lists one by one, you get new, lists, with succesive sums, you drop the last element of each, you assign numbers to these lists, you cycle through them, you can get from list A to list B if there are no intersections between the two, you get these little graphs, and you just have to enumerate the

2011-12-15T22:38:54  <Scryer> How do you decide it's significantly better?  Looks like it hasn't come up to v11 on Fluxid yet.
2011-12-15T22:39:11  <thestinger> Scryer: fluxid.pl is basically broken atm :P
2011-12-15T22:39:26  <thestinger> games go missing, and bots are using 2-3s a turn

2011-12-15T22:39:39  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I just do a bunch of stuff and then use git add -p to split it up into meaningful blocks

2011-12-15T22:47:39  <thestinger> they say they don't intend to keep it that way but it seems like BS to me
2011-12-15T22:47:49  <thestinger> the commercial version just lets you use it without having to deal with the LGPL
2011-12-15T22:48:03  <amstan> deal with LGPL?
2011-12-15T22:48:08  <amstan> it's not that hard
2011-12-15T22:48:13  <thestinger> well
2011-12-15T22:48:22  <thestinger> companies pay them to avoid having to distribute the code for Qt basically...
2011-12-15T22:48:28  <thestinger> that's where all the money comes from :P
2011-12-15T22:48:39  <amstan> you don't have to distribute the code
2011-12-15T22:48:51  <amstan> you just need to dynamically link it
2011-12-15T22:49:00  <amstan> and not do any modifications on it
2011-12-15T22:49:01  <thestinger> yeah, corporations are stupid though
2011-12-15T22:49:24  <thestinger> they would probably have to pay lawyers to make sure everything was alright
2011-12-15T22:50:21  <thestinger> maybe their current model isn't earning them any money, and that's why they didn't apply the fixes to the LGPL version

2011-12-15T22:51:31  <thestinger> is that why you use FreeBSD? :P

2011-12-15T22:52:52  <BenJackson> ok this cell maze kind of sucked, but it was neat to see the visualization showing how my bot knew when it had sealed the edges and ensured there were no enemies inside
2011-12-15T22:53:26  <thestinger> I bet you can get into the top 5
2011-12-15T22:53:59  <BenJackson> top 10 is my current goal
2011-12-15T22:54:02  <thestinger> for some reason your bot seems to have bad luck on the official site
2011-12-15T22:54:12  <BenJackson> not sure it's luck
2011-12-15T22:54:17  <BenJackson> my bot makes some silly mistakes
2011-12-15T22:54:20  <BenJackson> V12 fixes a major one

2011-12-15T23:25:31  <BenJackson> with randmo games like your last one you're on a similar path
2011-12-15T23:26:29  <BenJackson> oh HOW DID I KNOW I'd get a nice 1v1 game right after I submitted
2011-12-15T23:26:34  <ChrisH_> yeah, at least I got a better matchup, but two of the other bots rolled over too easy for InsaneMalkavian, so he got early points and I came in 2nd, still acceptable.
2011-12-15T23:26:59  <BenJackson> but when I get to #20 how about a 10-way circus with bots ranked from #5 to #150
2011-12-15T23:28:37  <ChrisH_> It seems like there is range of bots in the 100-200 range that are pretty aggressive but not so great at defense and they can really throw the "balance" of a game off.
2011-12-15T23:28:56  <BenJackson> seems crazy that I can beat a bot at pos 3200 which is clearly a starter kit and still not outrank even a fraction of the starter kits

2011-12-15T23:34:42  <ChrisH_> I just fired up a single game on tcpants to get a foot in the door, but I have some code to work on tonight, so I can't run too many.
2011-12-15T23:35:13  <antimatroid> yeah i'm still working on my bot
2011-12-15T23:35:17  <BenJackson> I've been running tons of bots without much regard for the CPU
2011-12-15T23:35:22  <antimatroid> i want to get better samples of moves for battles
2011-12-15T23:35:22  <BenJackson> on a quad core
2011-12-15T23:35:25  <ChrisH_> seems like a slow match though, the network light isn't blinking too fast
2011-12-15T23:35:33  <antimatroid> yeah my bot is quite fast
2011-12-15T23:35:45  <antimatroid> usually takes less than 100ms to pick all its moves, even with a couple of hundred ants
2011-12-15T23:36:04  <antimatroid> i friggin timed out on tcpants too
2011-12-15T23:36:11  <ChrisH_> I have to do my development inside a VM, so I can't overload it too much even though the hardware is a Quad.
2011-12-15T23:36:19  <Scryer> This looks like a word problem. "If there are 164 players ahead of you, and the rate is 31 players per minute, how many minutes before your turn?"  Answer: 29.
2011-12-15T23:36:28  <BenJackson> one small way I can tell V12 is better is that V11 would mostly win or totally lose (0 point) whereas V12 is better at getting a few points and scoring in the middle in adverse circumstances
2011-12-15T23:36:29  <antimatroid> wait no i didn't
2011-12-15T23:36:35  <antimatroid> opened wrong terminal window aha
2011-12-15T23:37:19  <antimatroid> BenJackson: if i can draw with you i'm going to extrapolate and say I'm top 50 at least
2011-12-15T23:37:29  <antimatroid> assuming my bot doesn't have major crash/timeout issues
2011-12-15T23:38:11  <BenJackson> probably true
2011-12-15T23:38:13  <antimatroid> thestinger beat me  :(
2011-12-15T23:38:54  <BenJackson> I just got pwned on a similar maze map
2011-12-15T23:39:03  <antimatroid> maybe i need to care more about enemy hills?
2011-12-15T23:39:09  <antimatroid> i had the most ants at the end :(
2011-12-15T23:40:44  <ChrisH_> So I've been working on multi-hill strategy the last few days and it has turned out rather well. Watch my bot use spawn control ants nicely in this replay:  http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.35482
2011-12-15T23:41:38  <BenJackson> which one is you?
2011-12-15T23:41:47  <ChrisH_> Hint: I win.
2011-12-15T23:42:56  <ChrisH_> And I don't lose any hills.
2011-12-15T23:43:47  <antimatroid> it's pretty cool to watch
2011-12-15T23:43:56  <BenJackson> http://tcpants.com/replay.1459
2011-12-15T23:44:00  <BenJackson> I barely noticed the bug here
2011-12-15T23:44:17  <BenJackson> as in the hunt for red october, my ant closed the distance BEFORE IT COULD ARM ITSELF
2011-12-15T23:44:34  <BenJackson> at 8 ants I wasn't putting enemy hills into my attack function
2011-12-15T23:44:37  <BenJackson> but I did WALK RIGHT BY
2011-12-15T23:44:39  <ChrisH_> yeah, what's with not stepping on that hill
2011-12-15T23:45:03  <BenJackson> there was no specific "step on hill" rule in the explore code
2011-12-15T23:45:06  <ChrisH_> you must have a higher priority target for that ant for some reason
2011-12-15T23:45:10  <BenJackson> and it wasn't a general goal because I had so few ants
2011-12-15T23:45:13  *** Gnome <Gnome!~Gnome@CPE-24-209-131-188.wi.res.rr.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Gnome)
2011-12-15T23:45:19  <ChrisH_> oh
2011-12-15T23:45:25  <BenJackson> there's a timidity function
2011-12-15T23:45:27  *** Gnome <Gnome!~Gnome@CPE-24-209-131-188.wi.res.rr.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-15T23:45:34  <BenJackson> with 8 ants it will only attack hills if NOTHING is around
2011-12-15T23:45:36  <BenJackson> it's not very bright
2011-12-15T23:45:44  <antimatroid> what approach do you guys take for going after hills?
2011-12-15T23:45:51  <BenJackson> that's an illegal map anyway
2011-12-15T23:45:53  <ChrisH_> One thing I like about my latest versions is that all the pathing is done for all targets at once, so any ant not in combat can go to any target without stuff like that happening
2011-12-15T23:45:57  <antimatroid> atm i'm just zorg rushing them along with enemies after other stuff
2011-12-15T23:46:20  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: mine too.  that hill is just not a target (yet)
2011-12-15T23:46:40  <ChrisH_> my code has actually gotten simpler in many ways as I've made better use of the tools I've built.
2011-12-15T23:46:58  <ChrisH_> hills are always targets if my bot has seen them
2011-12-15T23:47:32  <BenJackson> on the tcp servers sometimes I watch the wrong color
2011-12-15T23:47:36  <ChrisH_> my "explore code" is just configuring explore targets
2011-12-15T23:47:36  <BenJackson> and wonder wtf my ants are doing
2011-12-15T23:47:44  <ChrisH_> lol, i've done that
2011-12-15T23:47:58  <antimatroid> http://tcpants.com/replay.1461 :D
2011-12-15T23:48:06  <ChrisH_> or I'll watch someone elses game and forget it isn't my bot controlling the white ants
2011-12-15T23:48:15  <BenJackson> ohh I'm wrong
2011-12-15T23:48:19  <BenJackson> that hill was on the attack list
2011-12-15T23:48:32  <BenJackson> that was the result of my new graduated explore bonus at start
2011-12-15T23:48:37  <BenJackson> it did what I wanted:  it expanded fast
2011-12-15T23:48:44  <ChrisH_> uh oh, someone just got beat by skycaptain.  ;)
2011-12-15T23:50:28  <BenJackson> no matter what happens I'm pretty damn pleased with games like this:  http://tcpants.com/replay.1449
2011-12-15T23:51:47  <ChrisH_> my first game on tcpants: http://tcpants.com/replay.1457
2011-12-15T23:52:02  <ChrisH_> "Ants not razing hills" jeez, what more could I do.
2011-12-15T23:52:39  <BenJackson> you couldn't have won that anyway
2011-12-15T23:52:42  <BenJackson> er that last hill
2011-12-15T23:52:47  <BenJackson> turn limit is 750
2011-12-15T23:53:04  <BenJackson> maybe
2011-12-15T23:53:18  <antimatroid> ChrisH: who lost to skycaptain?
2011-12-15T23:53:27  <BenJackson> everyone in a 10 player game
2011-12-15T23:53:39  <antimatroid> i thought he meant him or something
2011-12-15T23:53:47  <antimatroid> i only just won
2011-12-15T23:53:48  <ChrisH_> yeah, the game you linked, which included BenJackson
2011-12-15T23:54:02  <BenJackson> yep, I didn't break out initially
2011-12-15T23:54:10  <BenJackson> xathis would ahve gotten out of that
2011-12-15T23:54:46  <antimatroid> now i'm hoping for top 10 aha
2011-12-15T23:54:54  <antimatroid> i'm no xathis
2011-12-15T23:55:26  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: you're bot is looking pretty good from what I've seen.
2011-12-15T23:55:37  <ChrisH_> It will be fun to see how you do.
2011-12-15T23:55:44  <antimatroid> it's still pretty stupid with battle sometimes
2011-12-15T23:55:58  <antimatroid> like moves away from the enemy when it could be more aggressive
2011-12-15T23:55:59  <BenJackson> mine is really quite stupid with battle
2011-12-15T23:56:09  <BenJackson> I could probably put in the "simple combat" from the forum and do better
2011-12-15T23:56:10  <antimatroid> or makes stupid trades
2011-12-15T23:56:13  <BenJackson> but I'm sticking with what brung me
2011-12-15T23:56:17  <ChrisH_> News flash: My bot just beat xathis on the main servers:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=247684&user=10
2011-12-15T23:56:22  <ChrisH_> woot!

2011-12-15T23:57:26  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: any ideas on how much spawn control improves the quality of your bot on multi hill maps?

2011-12-15T23:57:32  <BenJackson> dat hill control
2011-12-15T23:57:47  <BenJackson> antimatroid: just follow the link
2011-12-15T23:57:57  <antimatroid> yes i watched
2011-12-15T23:58:14  <antimatroid> but from other testing he's done, it may or may not have shown significant improvement
2011-12-15T23:58:31  <BenJackson> it's actually easier than I thought
2011-12-15T23:58:39  <BenJackson> you know if you're eating
2011-12-15T23:58:44  <BenJackson> so you don't have to suffer any lag or anything
2011-12-15T23:59:07  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: I'm still not sure how much it helps, I think combat is still king, but saving steps by putting ants closer to their targets at spawn time has to help.
2011-12-15T23:59:27  <BenJackson> with the penalty of the ants on the hills initially
2011-12-15T23:59:39  <ChrisH_> it depends on the map, but I will take my victory over those bots on that map as strong evidence that it helps
2011-12-15T23:59:42  <BenJackson> the trick would seem to be knowing when to cap them
2011-12-15T23:59:52  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-15T23:59:55  <ChrisH_> yeah, i did a lot of experimentation with that part
2011-12-15T23:59:55  <BenJackson> because early is when it's going to help most
