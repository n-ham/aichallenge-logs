2010-11-08T00:44:58  <decipher> hey guys i have some strategy questions if anybody wants to help i have a game tree with "funneling" i guess its called attach to it, i have no problem funneling ships to the closest and having no triangles happening and its clean but i do know how many leaders i should have.. the front guys that attack is it based on enemy owned planets, my owned planets, or hand picked, or map relative?
2010-11-08T00:45:59  <Prillicy> I don't funnel personally
2010-11-08T00:46:11  <Prillicy> I treat each planet like an individual entity until all neutrals are gone
2010-11-08T00:48:08  <decipher> i didn't at first but it seems like its the top strat but first place kinda doesn't use it
2010-11-08T00:48:47  <decipher> at first i had a game tree 1 ply but i wasn't getting anywhere wasn't fast enoug

2010-11-08T04:28:36  <janzert> ugh

2010-11-08T04:29:59  <janzert> antimatroid1: no player1 isn't given any advantage or disadvantage
2010-11-08T04:30:36  <janzert> I checked that and actually it caused a bit of confusion because the way it was disabled was by actually modifying the source code of bayeselo
2010-11-08T04:31:25  <janzert> at some point I should probably change it and disable it in the normal way by just giving bayeselo the correct command
2010-11-08T04:33:18  <antimatroid1> janzert: thanks for checking, i will say as such when asked again

2010-11-08T04:34:50  <janzert> another thing that would have effected it is that bayeselo is always fed with the winner as player1
2010-11-08T04:35:25  <janzert> I double checked and did a test randomizing the winner to player1 or player2 and the ranking result was the same

2010-11-08T04:36:31  <antimatroid1> i'll be free from undergrad in 15 hours, then i can get back to my bot
2010-11-08T04:36:40  <janzert> the big thing limiting rank accuracy right now is only the past 3 days of games are used because of database performance limitations
2010-11-08T04:36:48  <janzert> I'm going to work on solving that soon
2010-11-08T04:37:07  <antimatroid1> yeah okay, can you make sure the elo's are reset at the start of the final contest this time?
2010-11-08T04:37:28  <janzert> hmm, they weren't last time?
2010-11-08T04:37:34  <antimatroid1> and i was wondering earlier, does it cause problems with an elo system and not completely randomising pairings?
2010-11-08T04:37:41  <janzert> but either way yeah, I agree with that
2010-11-08T04:37:42  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure they weren't in th eend
2010-11-08T04:38:04  <antimatroid1> in that, those who win their first game, get to play better better, then on average they end up higher maybe?
2010-11-08T04:38:22  <antimatroid1> better people* (i have lots of sleep to catch up on sorry)
2010-11-08T04:38:37  <janzert> antimatroid1: depends how they are skewed, when players can choose there opponent it can be a real problem
2010-11-08T04:39:25  <janzert> remember we aren't using a 'true' elo system to find the elo score
2010-11-08T04:39:53  <janzert> bayeselo handles it quite a bit better actually than if you tried to just use the basic elo system
2010-11-08T04:40:26  <antimatroid1> yeah, but i'm still curious whether the bots that win their first game are expected to end up with a higher ranking than an exactly equivalent bot that loses its first game
2010-11-08T04:41:07  <janzert> I don't think it would last long, no
2010-11-08T04:41:22  <janzert> but I don't have any hard data on it
2010-11-08T04:41:43  <antimatroid1> yep, it's just something that was nagging me before, not a huge issue
2010-11-08T04:42:24  <lavalamp_> speaking of ratings... my bot hovered around 250 for a week and then jumped to 150 without me doing anything... http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=10821
2010-11-08T04:42:48  <antimatroid1> lavalamp_: we're never going to get perfect rankings
2010-11-08T04:42:49  <janzert> btw, working on matchup rewrite right now that will use a previous submission's rank for a new submission's pairing

2010-11-08T04:47:36  * janzert freely admits having minimal sql experience
2010-11-08T04:47:47  <lavalamp_> I expected it to be an update
2010-11-08T04:48:19  <janzert> nope, each new set of rankings is added
2010-11-08T04:48:28  <janzert> all the old ones are still there
2010-11-08T04:48:34  <janzert> I'm fighting that a bit right now
2010-11-08T04:48:39  <lavalamp_> ok so it does keep a history and that's intentional
2010-11-08T04:48:54  <janzert> since the rankings table currently has over 40 million rows
2010-11-08T04:49:33  <lavalamp_> LOL
2010-11-08T04:49:51  <lavalamp_> oh I see, leaderboard_id allows you to tell
2010-11-08T04:50:08  <lavalamp_> ok I hadn't noticed that
2010-11-08T04:50:11  <janzert> right, each set of rankings is a leaderboard
2010-11-08T04:50:18  <lavalamp_> gotcha
2010-11-08T04:50:29  <lavalamp_> .... and this is done how many times per day?
2010-11-08T04:50:32  <antimatroid1> janzert: that's not something you have to "admit" like it's a problem :P
2010-11-08T04:51:12  <antimatroid1> sigh: still nothing in the way of a new bot then?
2010-11-08T04:51:13  <janzert> lavalamp_: every 5 minutes
2010-11-08T04:51:37  <lavalamp_> ok I'm going back to my original position which is that that is a problem
2010-11-08T04:51:40  <sigh> antimatroid1: nah... I'm trying something new though
2010-11-08T04:53:12  <sigh> oohh... I haven't seen that state before "Ready to be compiled"
2010-11-08T04:53:18  <antimatroid1> i ahve
2010-11-08T04:53:19  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-11-08T04:55:13  <lavalamp_> janzert: if I were doing it, I would write a script to copy the last leaderboard from each day into a new table... then do stuff with the new, manageable table
2010-11-08T04:55:14  <sigh> "entry created in db" what is this state?

2010-11-08T07:04:10  <Migi32> do any of you make use of the fact that the game is 2D? I personally only look at planet-planet distances so it could as well have been a 3D game but I was wondering if anyone else did.
2010-11-08T07:05:54  <raedwulf> Migi32: i use distances too, so you are correct
2010-11-08T07:06:10  <raedwulf> but to calculate the distances it needs to be 2d ;)
2010-11-08T07:06:49  <raedwulf> actually i mean the format of data my program parses has to be 2d
2010-11-08T07:07:11  <raedwulf> but with a few tweaks, it could easily be changed to 3d

2010-11-08T07:25:26  <Migi32> raedwulf, same here. If I were given 3 coordinates instead of 2 it would only be some very small changes that could make my bot play on those maps
2010-11-08T07:26:16  <antimatroid1> migi32: i treat it like a graph too
2010-11-08T07:26:27  <sigh> well, it is a graph
2010-11-08T07:26:28  <antimatroid1> but i think it'd still be more complicated like that were it 3d
2010-11-08T07:26:39  <antimatroid1> in that the distances don't have the same constraints
2010-11-08T07:26:43  <antimatroid1> with respect to the geometry
2010-11-08T07:26:45  <sigh> treating it as 2d can be useful for some heuristics though
2010-11-08T07:27:14  <Migi32> yea that's I was wondering if any of you calculated things that would make no sense in 3D, like battlefronts or "back" planets
2010-11-08T07:27:14  <sigh> for example if you have some geometric model for your front lines
2010-11-08T07:27:20  <sigh> :P
2010-11-08T07:27:25  <Migi32> :)
2010-11-08T07:27:36  <antimatroid1> am i right that you can't represent every 3d map in a 2d way such that the graphs are the same?
2010-11-08T07:27:51  <Migi32> you are right
2010-11-08T07:27:53  <antimatroid1> battlefront would certainly make sense in 3d
2010-11-08T07:28:04  <Migi32> well yes but they would be planes instead of lines
2010-11-08T07:28:08  <antimatroid1> redistribution in a way does my battlefront
2010-11-08T07:28:08  <sigh> technically, this is not exactly 2d
2010-11-08T07:28:15  <sigh> well, euclidean 2d
2010-11-08T07:28:18  <antimatroid1> no, the ceiling ruins it
2010-11-08T07:28:57  <antimatroid1> could that ever result in a map not being perfectly symmetric when it would under the euclidean metric?
2010-11-08T07:29:23  <Migi32> but for example in 3D you can have 4 planets at equal distances to each other, in 2D only 3
2010-11-08T07:29:27  <sigh> I don't see how, so long as it is centered on (0,0)
2010-11-08T07:29:59  <antimatroid1> migi32: my point is the graph encapsulates that, in that you can't have a graph with 4 planets equal distance apart
2010-11-08T07:30:03  <Migi32> sigh, even that's not necessary. Same distance => same ceil(distance)
2010-11-08T07:30:20  <antimatroid1> i didn't think it's possible, just thought i'd pose the question
2010-11-08T07:30:30  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-11-08T07:30:34  <sigh> Migi32: yeah, your right.. my bad
2010-11-08T07:30:41  <antimatroid1> anyway, must keep studying, pdes is so gross and lame
2010-11-08T07:30:47  <sigh> anywya, why restrict ourselves to 3d :P
2010-11-08T07:30:54  <antimatroid1> i want to do nd tron
2010-11-08T07:31:04  <sigh> would that be interesting at all?
2010-11-08T07:31:05  <antimatroid1> even 3d would be cool
2010-11-08T07:31:16  <sigh> really?
2010-11-08T07:31:21  <Migi32> because my brain can only visualise > 3D if I'm on LSD
2010-11-08T07:31:21  <antimatroid1> can't really watch, would be cool to do a couple of bots and play them against each other
2010-11-08T07:31:24  <sigh> 3d seems too sparse
2010-11-08T07:31:30  <antimatroid1> lsd is a wonderful thing
2010-11-08T07:32:02  <antimatroid1> sigh: the bots wouldn't be as intelligent, but you still only have max 6 moves per turn
2010-11-08T07:32:09  <antimatroid1> in 3d that is
2010-11-08T07:32:15  <antimatroid1> it's start blowing out as dimensions went up
2010-11-08T07:32:30  <Migi32> well, I was planning to make some video about planetwars and upload it to youtube, and while thinking about what to put in there I thought of a
2010-11-08T07:32:39  <Migi32> 3d visualiser, and then 3d planetwars :)
2010-11-08T07:32:48  <sigh> antimatroid1: my gut feeling is too much freedom
2010-11-08T07:33:02  <antimatroid1> sigh: the game has to end in finite time
2010-11-08T07:33:10  <antimatroid1> just use relatively small maps
2010-11-08T07:33:17  <sigh> antimatroid1: sure, but that doesn't make it interesting
2010-11-08T07:33:33  <sigh> you can run tron on a complete graph in finite time, but that game is trivial :P
2010-11-08T07:33:54  <antimatroid1> wait what?
2010-11-08T07:34:01  <Migi32> sigh, or on a tree
2010-11-08T07:34:07  <sigh> did I say something stupid?
2010-11-08T07:34:22  <Migi32> but you can run tron on any finite graph in finite time
2010-11-08T07:34:49  <antimatroid1> no, i just don't know what you mean
2010-11-08T07:35:00  <sigh> a complete graph is the extreme case of too much freedom
2010-11-08T07:35:07  <sigh> which is why I used that example
2010-11-08T07:35:24  <antimatroid1> complete meaning every node is connected to every other node?
2010-11-08T07:35:28  <sigh> yeah
2010-11-08T07:35:37  <antimatroid1> atm complete to me means every cauchy sequence converges in the space :p
2010-11-08T07:36:04  <sigh> :)
2010-11-08T07:36:19  <antimatroid1> so why are you running tron on a graph?
2010-11-08T07:36:27  <antimatroid1> minimax works really well for tron
2010-11-08T07:36:32  <antimatroid1> well, with small maps
2010-11-08T07:36:55  <sigh> I'm modelling the board as a graph
2010-11-08T07:37:05  <sigh> because that is the obvious generalisation
2010-11-08T07:37:14  <Migi32> a million bucks if you can find play tron optimally on a complete graph with the constraint that you have to end up on your starting point
2010-11-08T07:37:31  <sigh> haha
2010-11-08T07:38:03  <antimatroid1> what's the graph? min dist path to each square?
2010-11-08T07:38:10  <antimatroid1> what if that's not the optimal path?
2010-11-08T07:38:48  <Migi32> the graph is the distances between squares. But the squares are not necessarily on a rectangular grid :)
2010-11-08T07:38:50  <sigh> edges connect any two nodes that can be reach in one move from each other
2010-11-08T07:38:56  <Migi32> more like the planets in planetwars
2010-11-08T07:39:07  <antimatroid1> so it's not actually a complete graph?
2010-11-08T07:39:20  <sigh> no... not for normal tron
2010-11-08T07:39:44  <antimatroid1> gah, i'm pulling out paper and pencil
2010-11-08T07:39:54  <sigh> I generalised tron to arbitrary graphs, then constructed a silly example
2010-11-08T07:40:24  <Migi32> regular tron on a complete graph would be a 2x1 (or 1x1) playing field
2010-11-08T07:40:56  <sigh> normal tron is a square lattice... corner nodes have 2 edges, edge nodes have 3 and the rest have 4.
2010-11-08T07:40:59  <antimatroid1> hmm, i wish i had thought about tron like this earlier in the year
2010-11-08T07:41:11  <antimatroid1> sigh: they weren't all open maps
2010-11-08T07:41:12  <sigh> each move you may move to an adjacent node which has never been occupied
2010-11-08T07:41:24  <antimatroid1> and after first move, max number of turns was 3
2010-11-08T07:41:28  <sigh> antimatroid1: then you are just removing skme edges
2010-11-08T07:41:30  <sigh> *sme
2010-11-08T07:41:42  <sigh> or "pre-visiting" some nodes
2010-11-08T07:41:45  <antimatroid1> oh man, i want to do tron all over now
2010-11-08T07:41:48  <sigh> can think of it either way
2010-11-08T07:42:26  <sigh> well, they are the same way... you are just removing the node from the graph
2010-11-08T07:42:29  <antimatroid1> we need to get tcp servers for these older games going
2010-11-08T07:42:32  <sigh> haha
2010-11-08T07:43:01  <Migi32> yeah I've been thinking about possible future AI Contests. How about tron with N "snakes" instead of 1? :P
2010-11-08T07:43:18  <antimatroid1> nah, n player is way too hard
2010-11-08T07:43:29  <antimatroid1> you're going to need to dive into coalitions then
2010-11-08T07:43:30  <sigh> re-hashing old contests is not as fun either
2010-11-08T07:43:33  <antimatroid1> and the maths for that is messy
2010-11-08T07:43:36  <Migi32> no, 2 player, N snakes per player
2010-11-08T07:43:44  <antimatroid1> no, i would just like a tcp like thing for tron
2010-11-08T07:43:50  <antimatroid1> oh, okay
2010-11-08T07:44:01  <antimatroid1> too much of a repeat still
2010-11-08T07:44:14  <antimatroid1> i like the idea of doing a full on 3d world game
2010-11-08T07:44:30  <antimatroid1> i'm not much of a gamer, so fps doesn't really appeal
2010-11-08T07:44:56  <Migi32> fps with bots that have perfect accuracy is pretty lame as well
2010-11-08T07:45:18  <antimatroid1> i guess idea would be to restrict movement perhaps
2010-11-08T07:45:21  <Migi32> not to mention there's quite some research on the topic already, which is kind of a deal-breaker for me
2010-11-08T07:45:35  <antimatroid1> so you can only rotate your line of vision at a given rate
2010-11-08T07:45:56  <antimatroid1> lol, most of the ideas being used in these contests are far from original
2010-11-08T07:46:01  <antimatroid1> it's just rehashing old concepts
2010-11-08T07:46:28  <Migi32> what I mean is things like chess and FPS games already have very strong AI's
2010-11-08T07:46:42  <Migi32> Galcon and Tron much less
2010-11-08T07:46:50  <sigh> chess would be the worst choice :P
2010-11-08T07:46:53  <antimatroid1> i think dots and boxes would make for an intersting game
2010-11-08T07:47:04  <sigh> possibly, yeah
2010-11-08T07:47:11  <antimatroid1> barrier for entry is higher
2010-11-08T07:47:18  <Migi32> I don't know, a bit too abstract for me, I guess.
2010-11-08T07:47:23  <sigh> the danger is that someone actually solves it
2010-11-08T07:47:41  <sigh> I would like to see go-moku/connect-5
2010-11-08T07:47:44  <Migi32> with PlanetWars the first thing I though was "I can do this.", with Tron as well.
2010-11-08T07:47:50  <Migi32> with dots and boxes, meh.
2010-11-08T07:47:54  <antimatroid1> i'd be down for a contest on playing large 2 player non-zero sum games, but it'd just be who can approximate msne best
2010-11-08T07:48:22  <raedwulf> you can't really choose traditional games for the competition, because there's far too much influence from existing theory
2010-11-08T07:48:31  <antimatroid1> what about nxn tic tac toe?
2010-11-08T07:48:41  <sigh> that's been researched t death, no?
2010-11-08T07:48:46  <Migi32> lol, true
2010-11-08T07:48:49  <raedwulf> though Go might be interesting because it might spark so bright ideas ^^
2010-11-08T07:48:59  <sigh> Go is way to high barrier for entry
2010-11-08T07:48:59  <raedwulf> some*
2010-11-08T07:49:00  <antimatroid1> Go is a beast from what i've heard
2010-11-08T07:49:04  <raedwulf> yea
2010-11-08T07:49:09  <raedwulf> i don't know know how to play it myself
2010-11-08T07:49:15  <antimatroid1> neither
2010-11-08T07:49:29  <sigh> I know how to play, and I don't know where to start
2010-11-08T07:49:33  <sigh> other than all the fuss abut UCT
2010-11-08T07:49:51  <sigh> even figuring out where to finish is a bitch
2010-11-08T07:50:03  <raedwulf> but i heard its hard and computers haven't a clue how to play it well :P
2010-11-08T07:50:04  <antimatroid1> lol, i came up with something random to test the graph thin on with tron
2010-11-08T07:50:13  <antimatroid1> and actually came up with a reasonably complicated decision
2010-11-08T07:50:23  <sigh> raedwulf: that's a simplification
2010-11-08T07:50:28  <antimatroid1> i'll do a paint job, hang on
2010-11-08T07:51:15  <raedwulf> sigh: i didn't wish to write a book on the topic ^^
2010-11-08T07:51:21  <sigh> on 5x5 go has been solved... 9x9 they are close to pro level... 19x19 they are amateur dan level which is stronger than a lot of people will be after a year of playing
2010-11-08T07:51:40  <raedwulf> sigh: ah right cool
2010-11-08T07:51:42  <sigh> 19x19 is full-size
2010-11-08T07:52:00  <raedwulf> i was thinking 19x19
2010-11-08T07:52:33  <sigh> yeah... but I wouldn't say "haven't a clue how to play it well"
2010-11-08T07:52:51  <raedwulf> ok :P
2010-11-08T07:52:54  <sigh> can't compete against good players is more accurate
2010-11-08T07:53:41  * raedwulf sighs
2010-11-08T07:53:48  <sigh> :)
2010-11-08T07:53:58  <raedwulf> :P
2010-11-08T07:54:07  <Migi32> well, when developing a bot it's good to see why it's doing bad. That is so for planetwars and tron. But if my Go bot would be stronger than me, it would come down to tweaking numbers and testing it out on TCP
2010-11-08T07:54:44  <antimatroid1> http://imgur.com/9BrlP.png
2010-11-08T07:54:57  <antimatroid1> i think you just have to randomise your decision for that
2010-11-08T07:55:09  <sigh> what is that?
2010-11-08T07:55:19  <sigh> tron?
2010-11-08T07:55:26  <antimatroid1> a possible tron map, you start as player 1, other person starts as player 2
2010-11-08T07:55:48  <Migi32> antimatroid1, player 1 always wins, no?
2010-11-08T07:55:54  <sigh> yeah, I agree
2010-11-08T07:56:01  <Migi32> just go right
2010-11-08T07:56:01  <antimatroid1> Migi32: no
2010-11-08T07:56:13  <antimatroid1> oh wait
2010-11-08T07:56:16  <sigh> lol
2010-11-08T07:56:18  <antimatroid1> i didn't think of player 1 aha
2010-11-08T07:56:22  <antimatroid1> yeah nevermind
2010-11-08T07:56:23  <sigh> ...
2010-11-08T07:57:12  <nullkuhl> for JBotManager users: any opinion/comment about this mod : http://i54.tinypic.com/jzyyir.jpg
2010-11-08T07:57:32  <antimatroid1> looks cool
2010-11-08T07:57:35  <Migi32> but they had a good rock-paper-scissor map I think it went like this:
2010-11-08T07:57:38  <Migi32> ##########
2010-11-08T07:57:38  <Migi32> #________#
2010-11-08T07:57:38  <Migi32> ##1#2#####
2010-11-08T07:57:38  <Migi32> #________#
2010-11-08T07:57:38  <Migi32> ##########
2010-11-08T07:57:40  <antimatroid1> what i want more than anything is the ability to send exact fleet sizes
2010-11-08T07:57:57  <Migi32> if both go the same way, player 2 wins, otherwise player 1 wins
2010-11-08T07:58:20  <antimatroid1> yeah, there were plenty of sitations that were weird like that
2010-11-08T07:58:53  <Migi32> Nash equilibria would've done great for Tron, I think. Much more than for PlanetWars.
2010-11-08T07:59:41  <Migi32> nullkuhl, what's that slider there at the bottom? Don't remember if it's also there for the original JBotManager
2010-11-08T07:59:44  <antimatroid1> it was really easy to do a solid evaluation function on game states
2010-11-08T07:59:52  <nullkuhl> Migi32: it is, planet sizes scaling
2010-11-08T07:59:58  <antimatroid1> it was then just a matter of searching and maximising path the death once separated
2010-11-08T08:00:09  <antimatroid1> hence why c++ did so well
2010-11-08T08:01:28  <nullkuhl> antimatroid1: am not sure if its easy to type in a number and send to a target planet while the game is running in JBotManager
2010-11-08T08:01:56  <antimatroid1> when one clicks on a planet, input string, when they click on dest, convert string to num and send fleets
2010-11-08T08:08:57  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.82.53> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-11-08T08:08:58  <Migi32> thinking about Tron AI just gave me quite a good idea. PlanetWars and Tron are actually more similar than you may think :)
2010-11-08T08:10:59  <sigh> Migi32: you want to re-create wormbot?
2010-11-08T08:11:12  <nullkuhl> antimatroid1: yes but that means you wont be able to see current planet ships while ur are typing the no of ships you want to send
2010-11-08T08:11:16  <Migi32> oh, no not in that way :)
2010-11-08T08:11:30  <sigh> :P
2010-11-08T08:12:38  <Migi32> it's just one word but I'm going to test out this idea first and if it doesn't work well then I'm going to say it :)
2010-11-08T08:12:49  <antimatroid1> it's way different o tron
2010-11-08T08:13:34  <Migi32> maybe leaf node evaluation isn't ;)

2010-11-08T08:22:42  <Migi32> huh?
2010-11-08T08:22:52  <Migi32> if you time out once you lose not that game but the whole contest?
2010-11-08T08:23:08  <sigh> in tron, apparently that was the case
2010-11-08T08:23:14  <Migi32> wow
2010-11-08T08:23:39  <nullkuhl> O_O
2010-11-08T08:23:54  <antimatroid1> Migi32: i did, got disqualified for timing out in the final contest
2010-11-08T08:23:58  <antimatroid1> was sitting around 10th at the time
2010-11-08T08:24:20  <Migi32> ow, I feel sorry for you
2010-11-08T08:24:22  <antimatroid1> i didn't even know that was the rule till it happened, extremely devestating
2010-11-08T08:24:31  <antimatroid1> would be worse for this, that was only a few weeks of work
2010-11-08T08:25:06  <antimatroid1> i didn't shut up until that was changed for this contest :)
2010-11-08T08:25:12  <Migi32> haha :D
2010-11-08T08:25:36  <nullkuhl> was a silly constraint anyway
2010-11-08T08:25:43  <sigh> yes
2010-11-08T08:25:47  <antimatroid1> yep, the reason given was bots that timeout cost resources
2010-11-08T08:25:56  <antimatroid1> but really they'd have on average faster games than others
2010-11-08T08:26:00  <antimatroid1> cause they lose all the time
2010-11-08T08:26:22  <antimatroid1> if someone wanted to spam the server, they'd upload a lot of half decent bots that always use their time limit
2010-11-08T08:26:40  <Migi32> but was it a timeout as in you took 1.01s for a move or did it get stuck in an infinite loop?
2010-11-08T08:26:55  <Migi32> and they had to kill it themselves?
2010-11-08T08:26:56  <antimatroid1> you don't know, it cuts you off after a second?
2010-11-08T08:27:01  <antimatroid1> i never even got to see the game that killed me
2010-11-08T08:27:29  <antimatroid1> http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/profile.php?user_id=2788
2010-11-08T08:27:32  <antimatroid1> that was my tron profile
2010-11-08T08:27:47  <Migi32> lol
2010-11-08T08:27:48  <antimatroid1> a pretty good record
2010-11-08T08:27:54  <Migi32> Win win win win win ... :P
2010-11-08T08:28:07  <antimatroid1> i was consistently hitting 1st place with under a week to go
2010-11-08T08:28:14  <antimatroid1> i was expecting to be in the top 10 tbh
2010-11-08T08:29:37  <antimatroid1> in fact, that record looked better than second place if it had kept going :(
2010-11-08T08:30:17  <Migi32> well, a1k0n would definitely have beaten you on this map: http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/visualizer.php?game_id=4127685
2010-11-08T08:30:22  <Migi32> but still, impressive bot!
2010-11-08T08:30:48  <antimatroid1> you can understand my devestation when it was disabled and they wouldn't reenable it :P
2010-11-08T08:30:57  <Migi32> yea I can :)
2010-11-08T08:31:46  <antimatroid1> hence why i'm determined to get top 10 for this

2010-11-08T10:00:31  <demerzel_> you probably want the playgame.jar rewrite instead - iirc it just does command line resolution
2010-11-08T10:01:12  <Guest13825> hey, just wondering if there's a way to find matches between a set of players, without scraping the site. It's a small set so I guess actually it wouldn't take a lot of scraping..
2010-11-08T10:02:37  <demerzel_> well you'd have to parse each player's 'played game' list

2010-11-08T10:15:37  <demerzel_> to fix bugs etc
2010-11-08T10:15:48  <demerzel_> the one in the starter pack is a bit buggy

2010-11-08T10:16:03  <ananda_> oh yes!
2010-11-08T10:16:27  <ananda_> demerzel_:  thanks a lot for the info. So I've to download a source that is called "iirc" right?
2010-11-08T10:16:34  <ananda_> demerzel_: Thanks! I'll do it
2010-11-08T10:16:48  <demerzel_> oh iirc = acronym for 'if i remember correctly'
2010-11-08T10:17:02  <demerzel_> there is a folder named "src" in the jar itself
2010-11-08T10:17:06  <demerzel_> jars are just zip files
2010-11-08T10:17:22  <demerzel_> IF i remember correctly if not i'm sure it's on the googlecode site
2010-11-08T10:17:32  <ananda_> Oh sorry. Thanks for the clarification
2010-11-08T10:17:38  <demerzel_> but i would start with the rewritten version if possible

2010-11-08T10:21:23  <ananda_> demerzel_: I extracted the jar file and it shows many files named name.class. I actually want a jar package that does not check for wall time. Because I'm running on a ThinClient, this is required

2010-11-08T10:45:50  <Frontier> wtf? are you talking about me mother fucker huh?
2010-11-08T10:45:58  <Frontier> just kidding
2010-11-08T10:46:38  <demerzel_> i guess my bot isn't totally retarded it lasted 200 turns with him
2010-11-08T10:46:44  <Frontier> James, at least you win against XYZ :D
2010-11-08T10:46:45  <demerzel_> i'm debating how much restriction i put on moves
2010-11-08T10:47:01  <antimatroid1> ahh okay, well i'll be stupidly active in a day or so till the end of the contest
2010-11-08T10:47:03  <JamesMG> that's my aborted minimax attempt Frontier
2010-11-08T10:47:05  <demerzel_> oh wait no it's still retarded haha
2010-11-08T10:47:13  <demerzel_> i just had a 0 growth
2010-11-08T10:47:48  <JamesMG> I keep it running because it is kind of entertaining, and I plan to get back to it eventually
2010-11-08T10:47:52  <Frontier> demerzel_: My bot gets a divide by 0 when it sees a 0-growth, so i must attack it last
2010-11-08T10:48:24  <demerzel_> damn that's weird
2010-11-08T10:48:25  <demerzel_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=911846
2010-11-08T10:48:32  <demerzel_> he has a 20 ships advantage at turn 51
2010-11-08T10:48:42  <demerzel_> i am using a pure greed 4-ply move look
2010-11-08T10:48:46  <demerzel_> how the hell
2010-11-08T10:49:02  <demerzel_> we haven't touched each other yet
2010-11-08T10:49:19  <demerzel_> pure greed should be the optimal on just neutral acq
2010-11-08T10:49:22  <Frontier> just another bot who doesnt like 0 growth ^^
2010-11-08T10:49:31  <Xrillo> Hey, Accoun, could you please not have that many bots on the TCP server.. it's kinda boring when everybody plays your bot all the time. :)
2010-11-08T10:49:50  <demerzel_> hey Xrillo i don't know who you are but can you not tell other people your opinion on what they're doing unless someone cares
2010-11-08T10:50:16  <phreeza> lol
2010-11-08T10:50:19  <Xrillo> well, I though people care. :)
2010-11-08T10:50:35  <demerzel_> no, it's rather rude and presumptous
2010-11-08T10:50:36  <demerzel_> :)
2010-11-08T10:50:55  <Xrillo> whatever. :)
2010-11-08T10:50:56  <Frontier> what is a pure greed algorithm?
2010-11-08T10:51:07  <demerzel_> where you don't care what the enemy does
2010-11-08T10:51:10  <JamesMG> guessing it's just shooting for highest ship count by turn 200?
2010-11-08T10:51:12  <Frontier> did you watch Wallstreet 2?
2010-11-08T10:51:12  <demerzel_> ie no level for enemy move
2010-11-08T10:51:45  <Frontier> ok, so - what i do. but turn 200? seriously?
2010-11-08T10:51:47  <demerzel_> only thing i can think is he's either checking every individual node for highest payout or has a higher forecast horizon
2010-11-08T10:51:57  <phreeza> demerzel_: how many nodes do you have in your plys?
2010-11-08T10:52:04  <demerzel_> for neutral acq it's a 4-ply
2010-11-08T10:52:12  <demerzel_> because i don't have to look at his moves
2010-11-08T10:52:24  <demerzel_> i am stumped on how he got a better setup than me
2010-11-08T10:52:51  <JamesMG> wow I have some buggy code: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=911876
2010-11-08T10:52:55  <Frontier> 4-ply? does that mean 4 turns? or 4 acquisitions?
2010-11-08T10:52:59  <demerzel_> 4 acq
2010-11-08T10:53:09  <Frontier> lol
2010-11-08T10:53:56  <Frontier> JamesMG: pro tip: if you don't get a planet - send 20% more next time
2010-11-08T10:54:02  <demerzel_> damn i got some weird algorithms i guess
2010-11-08T10:54:17  <phreeza> one very unlikely possibility is that he solved this with >4ply offline and then has a lookup table for all the maps ;)
2010-11-08T10:54:33  <demerzel_> i dunno what i'm doing wrong but bogusbrainpower destroyed it completely
2010-11-08T10:54:39  <demerzel_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=911900 turn 19 he has over 100 ship adv
2010-11-08T10:54:53  <demerzel_> err 18 when we were both /32
2010-11-08T10:54:56  <JamesMG> that bug is caused by my "how many ships can he possibly have at this planet" function only looking a few turns out when my planet is that close
2010-11-08T10:55:08  <demerzel_> my algo must be wrong somehow but idk how it's looking at a modified gamestate
2010-11-08T10:55:14  <demerzel_> pretty simple really
2010-11-08T10:56:06  <demerzel_> maybe i need to look per node level or force it to followthrough on plans
2010-11-08T10:56:25  <demerzel_> i figured if move #4 is optimal now if i do moves #1-3 and recalc next turn move #4 will still be optimal but apparently not

2010-11-08T10:57:42  <demerzel_> that's the point of carrying around a modified gamestate
2010-11-08T10:57:53  <Frontier> That is one ugly situation, when your bot gives up on a target and gets really confused about what to attack every other turn

2010-11-08T11:14:08  <Accoun> please run more copies of u bots to get more games
2010-11-08T11:15:30  <rebelxt> Accoun, are you running 8 bots at the same time or alternating?

2010-11-08T11:16:39  <Accoun> 8 bots at the same time
2010-11-08T11:16:51  <Accoun> 8 copies of bot
2010-11-08T11:17:08  <rabidus> wtf?!
2010-11-08T11:17:15  <Accoun> for fast get reiting
2010-11-08T11:17:37  <Accoun> to math?
2010-11-08T11:17:50  <mega1> it was quite boring to to test on tcp because of that
2010-11-08T11:18:03  <p4p4> getting paired to one or another of those in 70% of all games totally wracked my elo.
2010-11-08T11:18:04  <mega1> if all of would do that then fine
2010-11-08T11:18:12  <rebelxt> Accoun, you may want to alternate.. we were getting way too many games against your bots for that reason
2010-11-08T11:18:13  <Accoun> run 8 copies like me
2010-11-08T11:18:14  <mega1> *all of us
2010-11-08T11:18:23  <mega1> Accoun: we can't
2010-11-08T11:18:31  <mega1> or at least some of us can't
2010-11-08T11:18:33  <Xrillo> nor can I.
2010-11-08T11:18:34  <nullkuhl> Accoun: actually i made a tiny java program that run X games of my bot in parallel
2010-11-08T11:18:34  <Accoun> 3 copies can?
2010-11-08T11:18:38  <nullkuhl> and N games in total
2010-11-08T11:18:59  <mega1> Accoun: I think 3 should be a good compromise
2010-11-08T11:19:03  <nullkuhl> this way, i play with different people and many games in short time
2010-11-08T11:19:06  <rebelxt> 3 copies would be much better.. 8 bots is an overkill for sure
2010-11-08T11:19:20  <nullkuhl> rebelxt: overkill for what ? server isnt that bad
2010-11-08T11:19:28  <nullkuhl> i run 10 bots in parallel and its all fine
2010-11-08T11:19:28  <Accoun> on 4 cores CPU anyone can run 3 copies
2010-11-08T11:19:52  <nullkuhl> it has nothing to do with cores
2010-11-08T11:19:55  <rebelxt> nullkuhl: overkill from other people's perspective.. i want to get more games against other people, not just accoun's bots ;-)
2010-11-08T11:19:59  <nullkuhl> i have 2 cores only and i run 10 versions
2010-11-08T11:20:38  <Xrillo> Ah, so I wasn't the only to think of it this way, eh? :)
2010-11-08T11:21:24  <p4p4> i think, there's just not enough other players there ! now: 25 connections, 8 of them being account
2010-11-08T11:22:34  <p4p4> maybe need to do some advertisement for tcp
2010-11-08T11:23:59  <demerzel_> man my neutral selection blows but i have no idea why
2010-11-08T11:24:01  <rebelxt> it's really easy to write a script which alternates games for all of your bots, i.e. v1, v2, v3, v1, v2, v3, etc this sounds very reasonable
2010-11-08T11:25:15  <Accoun> 5 conections is ok?
2010-11-08T11:27:59  <rebelxt> any number of concurrent connections is OK since TCP server owner (dhartmei) does not enforce any rules. i personally feel 3 connections is a good compromise
2010-11-08T11:28:02  <p4p4> even 8 are ok for me, we've just got to wake up those sleepers.

2010-11-08T11:43:14  <rebelxt> demerzel_: regarding neutral selection issues - what's your scoring function like? max growth or max ship count increase within a number of turns? or something more complex?
2010-11-08T11:46:18  <demerzel_> the latter
2010-11-08T11:49:28  <rebelxt> demerzel_: so what are the issues you are having? greedy neutral selection algorithm is supposed to work pretty well.. of course the ideal is enumerating all possible neutral capture sequences and picking the best sequence (similar to traveling salesman problem).
2010-11-08T11:50:09  <demerzel_> yes i do that - i am not sure what the issue is - might be implementation, i have huge gaps in neutral acq vs enemy
2010-11-08T11:50:17  <demerzel_> should be close to even at least i am digging through the code ;)
2010-11-08T11:51:48  <rebelxt> yeah probably just a bug

2010-11-08T12:24:48  <mega1> a bit similar to go
2010-11-08T12:24:58  <Xrillo> yea, Hex is also an interesting game. :)

2010-11-08T12:32:31  <demerzel_> hex has ai?  isn't that the game where player 1 can always win by just copying player 2?
2010-11-08T12:32:52  <demerzel_> thought that was a nash thing
2010-11-08T12:33:22  <lavalamp__> hex uses a pie rule to defeat that strategy
2010-11-08T12:33:47  <lavalamp__> IOW player a makes the first move and then player b decides which color they want to play
2010-11-08T12:34:42  <demerzel_> so why couldn't b just use the same advantage
2010-11-08T12:35:14  <lavalamp__> because A won't play in the center (the starting move which is necessary for that strategy)
2010-11-08T12:35:37  <demerzel_> ah ok
2010-11-08T12:35:55  <lavalamp__> A has to find a move that's good but not TOO good :)
2010-11-08T12:35:57  <demerzel_> i didn't know it was requisite to a certain move
2010-11-08T12:36:50  <lavalamp__> I've never played the game but that's the only way I can imagine that strategy working out
2010-11-08T12:38:48  <lavalamp__> I can't imagine why Nash thought Hex was superior to Go...
2010-11-08T12:40:04  <demerzel_> i am trying to remember what game it is where you have a hexagon and you start out on one side and want to get to the other - is that hex?  was called chinese stones or some crap
2010-11-08T12:40:12  <demerzel_> fuzzy memory lol
2010-11-08T12:40:23  <lavalamp__> chinese checkers starts on a hexagonal star

2010-11-08T12:48:58  <lavalamp__> demerzel_, most people haven't even heard of it... I play at a club at a coffee shop and explain it to a lot of passerbys...
2010-11-08T12:49:04  <lavalamp__> phreeza: yup
2010-11-08T12:49:30  <lavalamp__> I was wondering if anyone would ask me, hehe
2010-11-08T12:49:37  <phreeza> :)
2010-11-08T12:49:44  <phreeza> Krumm means crooked in gemran
2010-11-08T12:49:47  <phreeza> german*
2010-11-08T12:49:55  <lavalamp__> haha
2010-11-08T12:50:47  <demerzel_> lavalamp_: most people know it as othello/reversi not as go - granted they are different but rules are similar
2010-11-08T12:51:07  <lavalamp__> *head explodes*
2010-11-08T12:51:19  <fluffluff1> very very different games...
2010-11-08T12:51:29  <lavalamp__> othello/reversi is NOTHING like go
2010-11-08T12:51:34  <demerzel_> not flipping :P
2010-11-08T12:51:39  <lavalamp__> the goal is similar
2010-11-08T12:51:45  <Naktibalda> to win :)
2010-11-08T12:51:47  <phreeza> similar boards
2010-11-08T12:51:55  <lavalamp__> phreeza: no
2010-11-08T12:52:06  <phreeza> no?
2010-11-08T12:52:06  <lavalamp__> othello you play in the squares, go the intersections
2010-11-08T12:52:17  <lavalamp__> also a go board is 19x19
2010-11-08T12:52:22  <lavalamp__> othello is 8x8
2010-11-08T12:52:23  <phreeza> hehe does it matter?
2010-11-08T12:52:31  <Naktibalda> gomoku is more similar
2010-11-08T12:52:42  <lavalamp__> Naxtibalda: to which?
2010-11-08T12:52:46  <demerzel_> if somebody doesn't know go i doubt they will know gomoku
2010-11-08T12:53:02  <lavalamp__> gomoku is more commonly known as five-in-a-row
2010-11-08T12:53:20  <lavalamp__> it at least really is played on the same board
2010-11-08T12:53:26  <demerzel_> it's a square board with black/white pieces - one flips, the other captures -- all you need to know to get started
2010-11-08T12:53:34  <demerzel_> in any of them
2010-11-08T12:53:49  <lavalamp__> ...
2010-11-08T12:54:24  <demerzel_> what there are more complexities than that?  i had no idea :P
2010-11-08T12:54:37  <lavalamp__> othello has no ko rule
2010-11-08T12:54:56  <demerzel_> because it's not possible
2010-11-08T12:55:00  <lavalamp__> yes
2010-11-08T12:55:37  <demerzel_> there are a ton of differences obviously i was referring to your 'nobody knows what it is' comment, what i would say to that person
2010-11-08T12:55:55  <demerzel_> if you overwhelm them with the deep and rich history of ko rules and go and how it is DEFINITELY NOT like other games you will jsut turn them off lol
2010-11-08T12:56:36  <lavalamp__> ah yes actually I do say the goal is similar to othello
2010-11-08T12:57:07  <lavalamp__> I have it down to a few sentences because that's all most people have patience for
2010-11-08T12:57:19  <janzert> but it seems to me othello is only slightly more like go than american checkers is like chess
2010-11-08T12:58:02  <lavalamp__> janzert: see my head exploding earlier
2010-11-08T12:58:56  <lavalamp__> ok people bbl

2010-11-08T13:38:36  <rabidus> i found myself some ... 'challenges' but they were all dead
2010-11-08T13:43:51  <phreeza> i can't find the public server i ran my bot on back then... but this looks good http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/
2010-11-08T13:43:52  <jmcarthur> heh, if we were to have a pokerbot ai contest i wonder how many people would feel confident enough in their bots to gamble real money with them :P
2010-11-08T13:44:08  <jmcarthur> doubtful that it would even be legal in the US

2010-11-08T13:46:46  <Bobng> I think a poker tournament would be quite good.
2010-11-08T13:49:06  <rabidus> too much luck involved
2010-11-08T13:52:58  <demerzel_> mega1 are you still around?  curious what your branching factor is with 2ply - gotta be nuts
2010-11-08T13:53:26  <demerzel_> i am still fighting my stupid tree because it keeps hooking the same move :(
2010-11-08T13:53:34  <demerzel_> not always though so not obvious to catch lol
2010-11-08T13:53:38  <mega1> I think the branching factor is about a 100
2010-11-08T13:53:45  <demerzel_> that's it?
2010-11-08T13:53:56  <mega1> dunno
2010-11-08T13:53:57  <demerzel_> damn i would have expected way more
2010-11-08T13:54:22  <demerzel_> consider 10 moves apiece you've got 20 separate scenarios with 200 possibilities apiece
2010-11-08T13:54:22  <mega1> depends on parameters
2010-11-08T13:54:40  <mega1> obviously I don't generate all of them
2010-11-08T13:54:58  <demerzel_> what do you consider a move if you don't mind me asking?  i've limited mine to capture / defending
2010-11-08T13:55:11  <demerzel_> still debating if i should put the restrictions i do on my captures on enemy projections
2010-11-08T13:56:02  <mega1> a move is set of orders not necessarily to be carried out on the same turn
2010-11-08T13:56:06  <mega1> *is a
2010-11-08T13:56:31  <demerzel_> does your eval account for the turn or do you cap the horizon?

2010-11-08T13:57:10  <demerzel_> lol
2010-11-08T13:57:14  <mega1> what does "account for the turn" mean?
2010-11-08T13:57:33  <demerzel_> well a move that isn't available till turn 8 may not be the 'best move' if you're only looking to turn 20
2010-11-08T13:57:42  *** choas <choas!~lars@p578F6FE3.dip.t-dialin.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-08T13:57:49  <demerzel_> so either you're capping it further out or putting some kind of turn modifier in
2010-11-08T13:57:53  <mega1> yes, I cap the horizon
2010-11-08T13:58:25  <mega1> there is no point in simulating a game for 200 turns when the uncertainty is too high
2010-11-08T13:58:33  <demerzel_> your bot inspired me to do the full on tree search btw ;)
2010-11-08T13:58:39  <demerzel_> yea that's true
2010-11-08T13:58:43  <demerzel_> i think my horizon is too low
2010-11-08T13:59:04  <lavalamp__> I've been using the maximum distance on the board as the horizon
2010-11-08T13:59:09  <demerzel_> same
2010-11-08T13:59:09  <mega1> ... which can prevent you from getting expensive planets

2010-11-08T14:00:30  <demerzel_> somebody theorized you were using book moves mega1 - is that true?
2010-11-08T14:00:53  <demerzel_> for the record i doubt it but i am curious
2010-11-08T14:01:17  * mega1 considers misleading #aichallenge
2010-11-08T14:01:40  <demerzel_> haha even if you spelled out your entire logic i doubt many of us could actually implement it
2010-11-08T14:01:42  <lavalamp__> lol
2010-11-08T14:01:42  <mega1> no, I don't
2010-11-08T14:01:44  <demerzel_> this tree stuff is nightmarish
2010-11-08T14:02:12  <demerzel_> to debug that is, implement fairly easy haha
2010-11-08T14:02:23  <mega1> book moves are worthless come the final tournament if there is no generalization
2010-11-08T14:02:29  <lavalamp__> hm I think I need to rethink my move generation
2010-11-08T14:02:52  <demerzel_> mega1: yea that was what i was thinking too but also that i doubt they will make new maps
2010-11-08T14:03:04  <demerzel_> i still doubt the usefulness of book moves though
2010-11-08T14:03:24  <mega1> I hope they will.
2010-11-08T14:03:39  <lavalamp__> I think I've been using my tree to try and solve the wrong problems...
2010-11-08T14:03:42  <mega1> creating opening books is boring
2010-11-08T14:03:45  <demerzel_> amstan what's the word on that
2010-11-08T14:04:01  <demerzel_> re: creating new maps for final tournament to avoid book openings
2010-11-08T14:04:20  <amstan> we will
2010-11-08T14:04:28  <demerzel_> oh cool i didn't know it was official
2010-11-08T14:04:40  <demerzel_> i guess i can unhook the database then haah
2010-11-08T14:05:01  <lavalamp__> amstan: and will you be using the same generation script? (i.e., always 23 planets?)
2010-11-08T14:05:12  <demerzel_> or at the very least <=23 haha
2010-11-08T14:05:26  <amstan> probably just changing the seed
2010-11-08T14:05:30  <demerzel_> otherwise Demerzel crashed / timed out / did not start.
2010-11-08T14:05:30  <kjdf> amstan: would it be possible to change timout rule to 200s per game instead 1s per turn? this would make it much friendlier for garbage collected languages
2010-11-08T14:05:55  <lavalamp__> amstan ok that makes sense
2010-11-08T14:06:09  <demerzel_> sounds good
2010-11-08T14:06:19  <demerzel_> did you guys have any idea how much effort bots in this would be vs. the last contest?
2010-11-08T14:06:28  <demerzel_> it's pretty large effort, much more than i originally anticipated
2010-11-08T14:06:31  <janzert> kjdf: almost certainly won't happen for this tournament, also it causes other problems
2010-11-08T14:06:50  <demerzel_> i just used static everything so gc wasn't an issue
2010-11-08T14:07:02  <demerzel_> not like you need to destroy/recreat
2010-11-08T14:07:08  <lavalamp__> demerzel_ C doesn't even have GC
2010-11-08T14:07:12  <amstan> kjdf: that just means a program can spin for 200 seconds without even giving a first turn
2010-11-08T14:07:19  <demerzel_> yes my official entry is C# tho :P
2010-11-08T14:07:45  <kjdf> yes but then it will have to think fast or lose...
2010-11-08T14:07:46  <demerzel_> until i get this damn tree debugged
2010-11-08T14:08:39  <amstan> kjdf: no.. that means that if someone submits an infinite loop bot, they'll be given 200 seconds for nothing..
2010-11-08T14:08:58  <demerzel_> you could institute a hard limit per turn just higher
2010-11-08T14:09:03  <demerzel_> ie 200s/5s per turn
2010-11-08T14:09:20  <amstan> that just makes things unnecessarily complicated
2010-11-08T14:09:24  <demerzel_> personally though i think people just need to learn to code without destroying objects until they're not needed any more ;)
2010-11-08T14:09:30  *** fawek_ is now known as fawek
2010-11-08T14:09:43  <amstan> if you picked a garbage collected language, you have to realize the disadvantages of using them
2010-11-08T14:09:48  <kjdf> demerzel_: hard to do that in functional languages
2010-11-08T14:10:06  <demerzel_> kjdf: functional like what?  i didn't destroy a single object in my C# implementation
2010-11-08T14:10:14  <kjdf> like lisp
2010-11-08T14:10:27  <demerzel_> ah well i don't know lisp but i'm sure mega1 can answer that haha
2010-11-08T14:10:42  <kjdf> amstan ok i get it :) I will just set harder timeout limits then

2010-11-08T14:14:26  <lavalamp__> kjdf, you could try manually triggering your GC right after you finish your turn-- I plan to do that if it becomes an issue

2010-11-08T14:15:17  <demerzel_> that might cause more problems than its worth
2010-11-08T14:15:22  <brx> lavalamp__: that seems like a good idea.
2010-11-08T14:15:30  <demerzel_> not sure what lisp's gc model is but it costs to call gc
2010-11-08T14:15:50  <brx> demerzel_: hence you call it right after your turn. before it's your turn again.
2010-11-08T14:15:56  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4211), shangas(4030), bix0r4ever(4012), george(3985), rsergio(3948), GreenTea(3936), Accoun(3899), dmj111(3895), Xrillo(3891), medrimonia(3876)
2010-11-08T14:16:06  <kjdf> brx but clock starts while you are doing gc
2010-11-08T14:16:13  <kjdf> and then you don't even know how much time you have left
2010-11-08T14:16:42  <lavalamp__> hm that might be a problem... but you can time the GC
2010-11-08T14:16:46  <brx> kjdf: that is possible.
2010-11-08T14:16:50  <brx> mh
2010-11-08T14:17:28  <jmcarthur> you can probably even get away with only running the GC every n turns
2010-11-08T14:17:33  <demerzel_> how do you even know gc is a problem
2010-11-08T14:17:36  * brx nods at jmcarthur 
2010-11-08T14:17:39  <demerzel_> i would make sure it is before implementing anything like that
2010-11-08T14:17:46  <jmcarthur> yeah really
2010-11-08T14:17:54  <brx> demerzel_: gc can randomly spin up and throw you over the timeout threshold.
2010-11-08T14:18:01  <demerzel_> theoretically yes
2010-11-08T14:18:08  <demerzel_> but if you're dealing with a bunch of tiny ints it probably won't
2010-11-08T14:18:16  <demerzel_> plus if it's just clearing tiny ints it's probably already as quick as it can be
2010-11-08T14:18:22  <jmcarthur> it depends on the allocation model
2010-11-08T14:18:59  <demerzel_> i'm not saying it's not possible i'm just saying manually playing with the gc is a rare solution to a rare problem
2010-11-08T14:19:10  <jmcarthur> it's not rare
2010-11-08T14:19:10  <demerzel_> i would make sure i have the problem first
2010-11-08T14:19:18  <jmcarthur> but i would still make sure i had the problem, as you say
2010-11-08T14:19:25  <demerzel_> maybe not in lisp idk
2010-11-08T14:19:44  <brx> in lisp it shouldn't be a problem.
2010-11-08T14:19:46  <jmcarthur> it's not rare in most runtimes that i know of
2010-11-08T14:19:48  <demerzel_> in java/.net you don't wanna mess with the gc
2010-11-08T14:19:56  <demerzel_> just program more efficiently
2010-11-08T14:20:17  <jmcarthur> ah, if we exclude GC-unfriendly code then you're right, it's rare
2010-11-08T14:20:31  <lavalamp__> lol
2010-11-08T14:20:44  <jmcarthur> but GC-unfriendly code is quite common
2010-11-08T14:20:53  <demerzel_> lern2code ;)
2010-11-08T14:21:20  <demerzel_> honestly i actually had the same concern with .net
2010-11-08T14:21:23  <demerzel_> i set up a gc run per turn
2010-11-08T14:21:30  <demerzel_> ended up costing a ton more than it needed
2010-11-08T14:21:48  <jmcarthur> mark and sweep GC in an impure language really sucks when you have deep trees
2010-11-08T14:21:51  <demerzel_> gc on first turn is an ok deal
2010-11-08T14:21:55  <demerzel_> during warmup
2010-11-08T14:21:58  <demerzel_> i wouldn't do it after that
2010-11-08T14:22:33  <demerzel_> ah i went to the length of actually reusing static vars rather than local
2010-11-08T14:22:38  <demerzel_> in .net
2010-11-08T14:22:45  <jmcarthur> yuck
2010-11-08T14:23:40  <demerzel_> well in nodes it makes sense
2010-11-08T14:23:48  <demerzel_> you're going to have a lot of cleanup needed if you don't reuse
2010-11-08T14:24:05  <demerzel_> or byref
2010-11-08T14:24:47  <jmcarthur> "in nodes"?
2010-11-08T14:26:22  <demerzel_> with nodes?
2010-11-08T14:27:08  <jmcarthur> what nodes?
2010-11-08T14:27:33  <demerzel_> "the" nodes
2010-11-08T14:27:33  <jmcarthur> "node" is a very generic word and I think i'm not clear on the context
2010-11-08T14:27:40  <demerzel_> with programming
2010-11-08T14:27:42  <demerzel_> and nodes
2010-11-08T14:27:43  <jmcarthur> yes?
2010-11-08T14:27:50  <demerzel_> like a language
2010-11-08T14:27:50  <jmcarthur> even in programming is pretty generic
2010-11-08T14:28:00  <demerzel_> you make words and calculate
2010-11-08T14:28:02  <jmcarthur> a language called nodes?
2010-11-08T14:28:06  <demerzel_> nodeOS
2010-11-08T14:28:25  <demerzel_> .js
2010-11-08T14:28:37  <brx> that reminds me, antimatroid1, has the bayeselo question been cleared up already?
2010-11-08T14:28:47  <demerzel_> brx: yea it has
2010-11-08T14:28:55  <brx> to what end?
2010-11-08T14:29:06  <demerzel_> whatever version they got already had the source modified
2010-11-08T14:29:10  <jmcarthur> as in node.js?
2010-11-08T14:29:15  <brx> ah, good!
2010-11-08T14:29:25  <demerzel_> jmcarthur: i am just screwing with you i don't even know what we're talking about
2010-11-08T14:29:31  <jmcarthur> *sigh*
2010-11-08T14:29:50  <jmcarthur> okay but what did you originally mean?
2010-11-08T14:29:57  <jmcarthur> "well in nodes it makes sense"
2010-11-08T14:30:12  <demerzel_> if you are making a search tree and creating nodes locally and destroying them that is bad
2010-11-08T14:30:22  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-11-08T14:30:28  <jmcarthur> well, not necessarily
2010-11-08T14:30:39  <jmcarthur> sounds like something that would be bad in java or .net
2010-11-08T14:30:42  <demerzel_> + if you want to avoid gc
2010-11-08T14:31:57  <jmcarthur> actually, even in java that doesn't sound like it would be very mean to the GC
2010-11-08T14:32:05  <jmcarthur> i'm not familiar enough with how .net's gc works
2010-11-08T14:32:41  <jmcarthur> my understanding is that java's gc should be very good with short-lived objects though
2010-11-08T14:32:56  <Migi32> true
2010-11-08T14:33:05  <Migi32> also, hi everyone
2010-11-08T14:33:15  <jmcarthur> it's a Migi32!
2010-11-08T14:33:56  <Migi32> Migi32 uses logic attack! It's super effective! :P
2010-11-08T14:35:25  <Migi32> but according to my understanding of garbage collection mark and sweep is equally effective if the tree is deep or not
2010-11-08T14:36:04  <amstan> can't you just turn off the garbage collector? how much memory do you need per turn? it's only 200 turns
2010-11-08T14:36:12  <amstan> memory leak till the end
2010-11-08T14:36:22  <Migi32> lol. The engineering solution ;)
2010-11-08T14:36:31  <lavalamp__> I tihnk it's a question of how big the tree is (i.e. how much garbage you make), not how deep it is
2010-11-08T14:36:31  <amstan> hey.. it'll work won't it?
2010-11-08T14:37:03  <lavalamp__> amstan, depends on memory limits and how much garbage you make...
2010-11-08T14:37:50  <amstan> i know in python there's a way to do manual garbage collection
2010-11-08T14:37:52  <Migi32> I think also "tiny ints" (or any POD's) aren't even garbage collected. Just reading through the logs...
2010-11-08T14:38:47  <amstan> Migi32: yeah.. in python, it actually reserves a few objects and uses them for ints from -1 to 10 or something like that
2010-11-08T14:39:55  <Migi32> ah, right, Python doesn't even have such a thing as a stack
2010-11-08T14:40:12  <Migi32> I mean, to put local small variables on
2010-11-08T14:40:59  <janzert> python mostly uses reference counting and only uses GC to break cycles
2010-11-08T14:41:32  <janzert> at least cpython that is
2010-11-08T14:41:36  <Migi32> what actually happens if your bot doesn't listen to stdcin for a while after it's written to stdout?
2010-11-08T14:42:25  <Migi32> is it written to a buffer and your timer starts running? Or do you just not get the data at all?
2010-11-08T14:42:33  <demerzel_> buffer
2010-11-08T14:42:35  <Migi32> ok
2010-11-08T14:43:40  <Migi32> but actually if you've only spent 1 second thinking, how likely is it that you will spend more than 0.1s garbage collecting?
2010-11-08T14:44:02  <demerzel_> calling the gc is more expensive than the gc itself in .net idk about other languages
2010-11-08T14:44:30  <demerzel_> it's not really made to handle direct calls tho
2010-11-08T14:44:37  <demerzel_> i think they took it out completely in 3.5 or 4
2010-11-08T14:45:29  <Migi32> well the real solution here is to just swallow your pride, stop playing with toy languages and use C/C++ :P
2010-11-08T14:45:31  <Migi32> or lisp :P
2010-11-08T14:45:47  <JamesMG> haha, "or lisp"
2010-11-08T14:46:01  <demerzel_> lisp has gc apparently
2010-11-08T14:46:03  <demerzel_> i did not know that
2010-11-08T14:46:17  <demerzel_> holy crap my bot won - i am going to enjoy that for a minute before picking apart its actions
2010-11-08T14:47:09  <demerzel_> ah there's shampoo to give me the defeat i need to get me going on debug
2010-11-08T14:50:30  <demerzel_> i apparently broke defending oops

2010-11-08T15:01:24  <JamesMG> I was testing new turn 1 code, obviously it's dumb :(
2010-11-08T15:01:33  <JamesMG> it went for planets it was never gonna get
2010-11-08T15:01:57  <demerzel_> that was a pure greed no holds barred one
2010-11-08T15:02:11  <demerzel_> i tried implementing auto-holdback based on defense need but it paralyzed it :(

2010-11-08T15:03:51  <demerzel_> it's totally screwed once it loses the upper hand tho
2010-11-08T15:04:18  <JamesMG> how does it choose planets to attack, pure growth/numships?
2010-11-08T15:04:28  <demerzel_> pretty much
2010-11-08T15:04:42  <JamesMG> the swarming behaviour of it messes with my fairly rigid defense code
2010-11-08T15:04:43  <demerzel_> it's a test of my neutral acq system really but if it has the upper hand it can be the entire game
2010-11-08T15:05:41  <demerzel_> maybe i'll port this bot to official it will do ok
2010-11-08T15:05:56  <demerzel_> just so i can have C and a bot less than 2 months old on there lol
2010-11-08T15:06:22  <JamesMG> your attack pattern makes me want to revise my defense code
2010-11-08T15:07:07  <demerzel_> haha holy shit it beat janstaunton too

2010-11-08T15:08:38  <demerzel_> hmm maybe i underestimated it: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=914520 it was definitely a comeback
2010-11-08T15:09:24  <JamesMG> interesting that it took the 0 growth middle planet
2010-11-08T15:10:00  <demerzel_> haha probably a bug
2010-11-08T15:10:04  <demerzel_> at least it didn't crash it
2010-11-08T15:10:18  <demerzel_> no i take that back
2010-11-08T15:10:28  <demerzel_> was probably evaluated as 0 gain

2010-11-08T15:30:28  <Migi32> demerzel_, I'd getchar() it, readline requires a char* buffer, which has a finite size. That can get nasty.
2010-11-08T15:30:45  <demerzel_> i'm not using actual readline
2010-11-08T15:30:55  <demerzel_> if orders are exceeding 128 chars i'm probably screwed anyway
2010-11-08T15:31:09  <demerzel_> (per line)
2010-11-08T15:31:30  <Migi32> demerzel_, quoting the specs:

2010-11-08T15:32:45  <lavalamp__> lol
2010-11-08T15:32:52  <Migi32> find*

2010-11-08T15:33:05  <demerzel_> fgets will work
2010-11-08T15:33:15  <demerzel_> i have a char buffer of 128 chars so yea what p4p4 said
2010-11-08T15:33:20  <Migi32> but somewhere it said that it's unlikely that comments are unlikely but that you shouldn't count on there never ever being comments
2010-11-08T15:34:05  <demerzel_> the only comment htey ever considered was a turn #
2010-11-08T15:34:29  <demerzel_> considering an actual line of planet data is 32 chars if somebody puts a 90 char comment in there i'll be mad
2010-11-08T15:34:54  <demerzel_> besides fgets has a safety on it
2010-11-08T15:35:06  <Migi32> ah yes true, good point.
2010-11-08T15:35:29  <Migi32> if it were a comment of > 128 chars it would just ignore those chars, I think
2010-11-08T15:35:42  <demerzel_> it would try to parse the last 128+ chars
2010-11-08T15:36:06  <demerzel_> would probably break me anyway
2010-11-08T15:36:07  <demerzel_> lol
2010-11-08T15:36:45  <Migi32> well, just pray they don't add # helloooooooo demerzel_ to the communications :P
2010-11-08T15:37:22  <demerzel_> indeed
2010-11-08T15:37:27  <demerzel_> although that is ok
2010-11-08T15:37:29  <demerzel_> :P
2010-11-08T15:37:50  * d0ugal adds random really long comments
2010-11-08T15:39:18  <Migi32> demerzel_, but why are you using c? c++ has some nice functions that don't have buffer limits (they just return a std::string)
2010-11-08T15:40:06  <demerzel_> because they do have buffer limits it's just hidden away
2010-11-08T15:40:10  <demerzel_> i don't need the overhead
2010-11-08T15:40:29  <demerzel_> plus i don't use a single c++ library not gonna do it for that lol
2010-11-08T15:40:43  <demerzel_> i do not like black boxes
2010-11-08T15:41:22  <d0ugal> Anywhere listing if the server has any non-standard python libs?
2010-11-08T15:41:28  <d0ugal> (like numpy)
2010-11-08T15:42:44  <demerzel_> haha how sad is that my bot has never used stdin/out to this point
2010-11-08T15:42:45  <Migi32> demerzel_, oh your bot is entirely c?
2010-11-08T15:42:52  <demerzel_> yes

2010-11-08T16:05:40  <JamesMG> 1000 turns, 100 planets!
2010-11-08T16:05:45  <janzert> I think it staying at 200 is a pretty safe bet at this point
2010-11-08T16:05:54  <JamesMG> janstaunton: I noticed your bot improved pretty drastically in the last week or so
2010-11-08T16:06:11  <demerzel_> oh i know what it is - for some reason i still had POD_structs.h
2010-11-08T16:06:18  <demerzel_> looking for pod_structs lol
2010-11-08T16:06:27  <janzert> Jeff talked about making an official statement about a week ago but never did

2010-11-08T16:06:48  <janstaunton> It's still a bit shit, I am making it infinitely better atm
2010-11-08T16:06:56  <janstaunton> but yeah, it is improving :D
2010-11-08T16:08:24  <janstaunton> My bot and yours seem to spar a lot
2010-11-08T16:08:29  <lavalamp__> demerzel_ at some point it becomes worth it to install virtual box, ubuntu 8, run the build script, and try your bot with gcc locally until it works... :P
2010-11-08T16:08:36  <janstaunton> Which one is your current bot, the dev one? @JamesMG
2010-11-08T16:09:13  <demerzel_> i am pretty close
2010-11-08T16:09:32  <lavalamp__> there aren't enough crappy bots on tcp any more... I should run some old ones
2010-11-08T16:09:32  <demerzel_> some kind of bitching about a global void instead of being in mybot.h
2010-11-08T16:09:35  <demerzel_> and something else
2010-11-08T16:09:42  <demerzel_> i can run mine :P
2010-11-08T16:09:47  <JamesMG> janstaunton: .old is the one on the official server, .dev is me trying to work out bugs and stuff
2010-11-08T16:09:52  <JamesMG> so .dev is changing pretty often
2010-11-08T16:09:56  <janstaunton> I see

2010-11-08T16:10:25  <janstaunton> And my official server one is well old :)
2010-11-08T16:10:35  <janstaunton> What's your username on the official server?
2010-11-08T16:10:38  <JamesMG> JamesMG
2010-11-08T16:10:46  <lavalamp__> lavalamp
2010-11-08T16:10:55  <JamesMG> it's still clawing it's way back up from 2000th place
2010-11-08T16:11:10  <janstaunton> :o
2010-11-08T16:11:19  <lavalamp__> mine was 250's and then magically became 150's over the weekend...
2010-11-08T16:11:49  <JamesMG> the server had me play someone in 2000th place when I resubmitted
2010-11-08T16:12:08  <JamesMG> and it has crashed a couple times on it's way back up due to C#/mono
2010-11-08T16:13:27  <demerzel_> uh wtf

2010-11-08T16:37:45  <demerzel_> what in the fuck
2010-11-08T16:37:49  <demerzel_> does it want
2010-11-08T16:37:55  <demerzel_> and why are warnings errors
2010-11-08T16:38:16  <lavalamp__> what's the warning/error?
2010-11-08T16:38:17  <demerzel_> oh that's fucking hilarious
2010-11-08T16:38:26  <demerzel_> qsort pointer 4 is incompatible
2010-11-08T16:38:29  <demerzel_> pointer 4 is a const void
2010-11-08T16:38:33  <demerzel_> which is an error
2010-11-08T16:38:44  <demerzel_> if i make it const void

2010-11-08T16:38:53  <lavalamp__> const void I would barf on, too
2010-11-08T16:39:26  <demerzel_> ok i have no idea what to do here

2010-11-08T16:40:32  <JamesMG> oh crap, forgot to clear my logs from the weekend
2010-11-08T16:41:14  <lavalamp__> why can't you just lose the "const"?
2010-11-08T16:41:22  <demerzel_> i already did that
2010-11-08T16:41:28  <demerzel_> i only get one error, qsort pointer 4
2010-11-08T16:41:36  <demerzel_> trying to make the predicate function a const that's my last idea
2010-11-08T16:41:49  <lavalamp__> I guess I'd have to see the line of code
2010-11-08T16:41:51  <demerzel_> nope
2010-11-08T16:42:01  <demerzel_> won't take an int, a static int, or a const int as an argument
2010-11-08T16:42:08  <demerzel_> for the predicate func
2010-11-08T16:42:12  <demerzel_> ok i'll pastebin it
2010-11-08T16:42:15  <demerzel_> i am out of ideas

2010-11-08T16:46:59  <lavalamp__> const void * should do it
2010-11-08T16:47:18  <janzert> try qsort(tempsort, kMaxPlanets, sizeof(int), &ascendints)
2010-11-08T16:47:19  <lavalamp__> int ascendints (const void * a, const void * b)
2010-11-08T16:47:25  <demerzel_> yea i am trying that now
2010-11-08T16:47:35  <demerzel_> lavalamp
2010-11-08T16:47:40  <demerzel_> i'll try janzert if that doesn't work lol
2010-11-08T16:47:47  <janzert> you want a pointer to ascendints basically
2010-11-08T16:48:00  <demerzel_> const void*a worked
2010-11-08T16:48:07  <demerzel_> a func is a pointer tho really
2010-11-08T16:48:11  <lavalamp__> janzert I don't think that should make a difference, there's an implied & when you mention a function, at least it C++
2010-11-08T16:48:12  <demerzel_> well i'm not gonna get into that lol
2010-11-08T16:48:19  <janzert> ok, wasn't sure
2010-11-08T16:48:22  <demerzel_> lavalamp_ and i had the same idea it worked :)
2010-11-08T16:48:31  <demerzel_> now the bot is proably broken from me playing with modifiers lol

2010-11-08T16:50:18  <janzert> now you get to the tricky part of debugging the contest entry :/
2010-11-08T16:50:32  <lavalamp__> demerzel, maybe it is time to set up that ubuntu virtualbox

2010-11-08T19:44:36  <demerzel_> i have no idea what to do i can't fix this i dont' even know what's broke -- i have it spitting out every character it gets and then it just dies at p18

2010-11-08T19:45:04  <McLeopold> what's a p18

2010-11-08T19:47:11  <demerzel_> but i can't figure this out - it runs fine on my machine but just dies there in sandbox (and on the main server)
2010-11-08T19:47:22  <demerzel_> i should say 'in IDE'
2010-11-08T19:47:32  <McLeopold> what game engine are you using?
2010-11-08T19:47:39  <demerzel_> iouri's
2010-11-08T19:47:47  <demerzel_> but it dies on main server too
2010-11-08T19:48:01  <demerzel_> i never put in stdin/stdout until now so i'm guessing it has something to do with that
2010-11-08T19:48:13  <demerzel_> but what i have no idea - i changed fgets to an individual char read
2010-11-08T19:48:31  <McLeopold> is this c code?
2010-11-08T19:48:35  <demerzel_> yea
2010-11-08T19:48:44  <demerzel_> i even manually added a '\0' to the end to make sure
2010-11-08T19:49:28  <demerzel_> C code: http://pastebin.com/Y5ys6SC0  -- io_output is a global char[128]

2010-11-08T19:51:39  <demerzel_> char io_output[128]; - have it in the .h too

2010-11-08T19:52:16  <demerzel_> it's not going over 128
2010-11-08T19:52:25  <sigh> either way, this code is not very safe
2010-11-08T19:52:40  <demerzel_> yea i know it was a quick attempt to look at one char at a time
2010-11-08T19:52:59  <demerzel_> i'd solidify it but there's the whole 'crashign at 18' provblem
2010-11-08T19:53:59  <demerzel_> it's successfully creating the planet too - MADE PLANET indicates it went through fine and the index is correct

2010-11-08T19:59:29  <McLeopold> from you output, it looks like the fprintf function?
2010-11-08T19:59:31  <cfaftw> i'm searching the forum... but C always sucks as a search term
2010-11-08T19:59:45  <McLeopold> how about starter?
2010-11-08T20:00:14  <McLeopold> cfaftw: on tcp right now?
2010-11-08T20:00:34  <cfaftw> no
2010-11-08T20:01:01  <demerzel_> no but the fact that the string is smaller on the last line tells me something broke badly

2010-11-08T20:01:38  <demerzel_> cfaftw: if you find a c starter pack hook me up cuz i had the cpp one but it's a bunch of << >> whatever
2010-11-08T20:01:38  <McLeopold> cfaftw: the framework
2010-11-08T20:01:45  <demerzel_> i even took the state out completely from that and it still broke :(
2010-11-08T20:01:47  <McLeopold> And the targeting system.

2010-11-08T20:04:43  <demerzel_> the C++ one would work but you'd have to move all the funcs out etc

2010-11-08T20:05:01  <McLeopold> yeah, I may have to do that.
2010-11-08T20:05:45  <cfaftw> demerzel_, i might just have to write my own... in reality it's not that much work, i guess
2010-11-08T20:06:12  <cfaftw> the only thing i want from a starter pack is the parsing routines... which i suppose i might be able to steal from the C++ pack
2010-11-08T20:06:42  <McLeopold> cfaftw: parsing is pretty easy.  Just roll your own.  should take only an hour.
2010-11-08T20:07:13  <cfaftw> mcleopold, yeah... i was just hoping for something premade to save me that hour :)
2010-11-08T20:08:27  <demerzel_> parsing is super easy with scanf

2010-11-08T20:30:07  <sigh> I tried minimax... but prelimarary results were not good, so I gave up
2010-11-08T20:30:11  <demerzel_> nodes are easy as hell in C lol
2010-11-08T20:30:33  <demerzel_> and fast - i can go 4 deep no sweat
2010-11-08T20:30:46  <cfaftw> well i already have an idea how to implement it... i just haven't used C in a while
2010-11-08T20:30:46  <demerzel_> that's 2 moves apiece tho not 4 apiece haha
2010-11-08T20:30:51  <sigh> actually, scratch that... the most amazing thing is that McLeopold is 74 with the bot he uploaded at the start of the competition
2010-11-08T20:30:59  <cfaftw> so my time upfront is shaking the rust off
2010-11-08T20:31:05  <sigh> cfaftw: why c? just for speed?
2010-11-08T20:31:25  <cfaftw> sigh, that, and I feel like i need a language change to force me to think differently
2010-11-08T20:31:36  <sigh> yeah, makes sense
2010-11-08T20:31:47  <cfaftw> every time i tried "redoing" it in Python, i ended up using the same basic methods
2010-11-08T20:31:54  <sigh> :)
2010-11-08T20:31:56  <cfaftw> it was hard to break the mold i had created
2010-11-08T20:32:44  <sigh> yeah... the core of my bot rests on a planet scoring function that hasn't changed significantly since I started

2010-11-08T22:41:30  <demerzel_> it's not limited to linux either apparently - just using iouri's visualizer breaks it too
2010-11-08T22:41:44  <demerzel_> around 800char - and the standard is 512 - somehow i think it's overrunning the buffer
2010-11-08T22:41:55  <demerzel_> have you?  is it C or cpp
2010-11-08T22:42:15  <demerzel_> i'm thinking to try setting a linebuf proxy but if you know a direct way that would be awesome

2010-11-08T22:42:23  <Frontier> a pipe is usually the size of a page, and that is 4096 bytes in my kernel, my code is c/c++
2010-11-08T22:43:03  <demerzel_> well i'm mostly interested in making sure the buffer doesn't overrun, i'm gonna try a linebuf thing here in a sec and if that doesn't work i'll try to adapt yours if you're feeling nice ;)

2010-11-08T22:50:31  <Frontier> the wait_for_data() method is where it tries to read from the child process' stdout & stderr. You can change that to read from stdin only. Basically it is checking for a HUP (indicating the pipe was closed by the other side) and IN (indicating the arrival of data). On internet sockets caution must be taken. POLIN can fire even if the arrived data was rejected due to checksum errors or something, so a subsequent read may han

2010-11-08T23:25:33  <bhasker> gromble*
2010-11-08T23:25:40  <bhasker> whats the issue demerzel
2010-11-08T23:25:47  <lavalamp_> That's the almost-latest one
2010-11-08T23:26:11  <lavalamp_> demerzel_, if you can get it into a small file I will see if I can figure it out
2010-11-08T23:26:15  <demerzel_> c stdin piped overruns whatever buffer in linux or windows
2010-11-08T23:26:27  <demerzel_> oh i've got it up one sec
2010-11-08T23:26:39  <demerzel_> somebody was trying to help me earlier to no avail haha
2010-11-08T23:27:08  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-11-08T23:27:47  <demerzel_> this was a quick and dirty one
2010-11-08T23:27:48  <demerzel_> http://pastebin.com/Y5ys6SC0
2010-11-08T23:28:00  <demerzel_> but i've used getc fgets fscanf blahblah
2010-11-08T23:28:12  <lavalamp_> bhasker, yeah gromble-gen.12 is my move generator with all my current bug fixes and it sucks, apparantly, lol
2010-11-08T23:28:15  <demerzel_> removed state and parsing entirely and it's still broken
2010-11-08T23:28:22  <bhasker> hehe yea :-\
2010-11-08T23:28:23  <demerzel_> it's always around 7-800 chars and the standard is 512
2010-11-08T23:28:44  <demerzel_> and like i said i can type to it just fine - for some reason piping doesn't clear th buffer
2010-11-08T23:29:22  <raedwulf> you can't poll too quickly
2010-11-08T23:29:37  <lavalamp_> can you show where you create/allocate the buffer?
2010-11-08T23:29:41  <raedwulf> it will lock the stream too fast
2010-11-08T23:29:54  <demerzel_> it's just a char[128] extern / declared above it

2010-11-08T23:30:11  <demerzel_> raedwulf so what is the solution
2010-11-08T23:30:29  <demerzel_> i've learned more about filestreams in c than i thought was possible to know in teh last 4 hours and still got nothing

2010-11-08T23:31:57  <demerzel_> but i have no way to know :(  i got it spitting out this from that code: http://pastebin.com/wVXrkGy7
2010-11-08T23:32:56  <demerzel_> fflush although it's not compliant does nothign except make it not work at all, same with fseek, same with assigning linebuf to a char*
2010-11-08T23:33:12  <demerzel_> wait wtf your bot is in c lemme see your stdin stuff lol
2010-11-08T23:33:48  <demerzel_> to this point i'd been playing exclusively on tcp via socket code so never had to make stdin/out till today
2010-11-08T23:34:07  <demerzel_> had NO idea it would be such a nightmare
2010-11-08T23:34:11  <raedwulf> demerzel_: i had to delay it a bit
2010-11-08T23:34:20  <antimatroid1> what are you having so much trouble with?
2010-11-08T23:34:24  <raedwulf> i read/parsed per line
2010-11-08T23:34:25  <antimatroid1> it shouldn't be that complicated
2010-11-08T23:34:31  <demerzel_> delay it how
2010-11-08T23:34:36  <raedwulf> seemed to work
2010-11-08T23:34:48  <demerzel_> antimatroid1: i promise you if there was an easy solution available to me i would have taken it hours ago
2010-11-08T23:34:52  <raedwulf> but i couldn't read an entire buffer until go
2010-11-08T23:34:58  <demerzel_> raedwulf delay it how
2010-11-08T23:35:07  <raedwulf> i just did some processing per line
2010-11-08T23:35:16  <raedwulf> and read per line
2010-11-08T23:35:26  <demerzel_> i do process - it creates the planets
2010-11-08T23:35:33  <raedwulf> but then again this is on linux - might be different issue
2010-11-08T23:35:34  <demerzel_> it's a per-line read :(
2010-11-08T23:35:44  <demerzel_> nah it has same problem on main server
2010-11-08T23:35:56  <demerzel_> so i need to slow my parser down somehow awesom
2010-11-08T23:36:06  <antimatroid1> i only create my planet objects once
2010-11-08T23:36:14  <demerzel_> hell that's turn 1 - it's creating all the planets and getting doubles etc
2010-11-08T23:36:20  <demerzel_> it's even faster turn 2+
2010-11-08T23:36:38  <demerzel_> any ideas raedwulf?
2010-11-08T23:36:52  <raedwulf> demerzel_: lemme check what i used in the end
2010-11-08T23:36:56  <demerzel_> shouldn't getchar block wtf is 'locking' the steam
2010-11-08T23:37:05  <demerzel_> stream*
2010-11-08T23:37:13  <raedwulf> demerzel_: i used fgets
2010-11-08T23:37:21  <demerzel_> never had an issue where my program was too fast lol
2010-11-08T23:37:30  <demerzel_> yea that's what i started with raed
2010-11-08T23:37:48  <raedwulf> hmmm
2010-11-08T23:37:49  <demerzel_> moved to per char so i could see that it was getting anythign at all
2010-11-08T23:38:43  <demerzel_> fflush just completely kills it
2010-11-08T23:39:02  <demerzel_> what is 'locking' the stream maybe i can go from there cuz i'm getting nowhere with the buffer angle
2010-11-08T23:39:11  <demerzel_> tried every damn solution out there
2010-11-08T23:39:53  <raedwulf> try fgets again?

2010-11-08T23:40:27  <demerzel_> haha i already have :P
2010-11-08T23:40:36  <lavalamp_> what's the ascii code for EOF?
2010-11-08T23:40:50  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: from what function?
2010-11-08T23:40:55  <raedwulf> what OS
2010-11-08T23:41:01  <lavalamp_> demerzel_ your code seems to work fine for me :/
2010-11-08T23:41:09  <lavalamp_> well ubuntu atm
2010-11-08T23:41:48  <raedwulf> ctrl+d but if you're programming, all fgetc will give you EOF, fgets will give you a NULL string and feof will be 1
2010-11-08T23:42:09  <lavalamp_> what does getchar() return?
2010-11-08T23:42:10  <demerzel_> 10
2010-11-08T23:42:28  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: no idea :) two sec
2010-11-08T23:42:29  <demerzel_> i turned off buffer completely via setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
2010-11-08T23:42:35  <demerzel_> lavalamp_ 10
2010-11-08T23:42:42  <demerzel_> it still doesn't work lol
2010-11-08T23:42:44  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: EOF
2010-11-08T23:42:52  <demerzel_> oh eof is -1
2010-11-08T23:43:02  <raedwulf> yes but its better to use the constant
2010-11-08T23:43:05  <lavalamp_> ascii 04 wikipedia says
2010-11-08T23:43:26  <demerzel_> well maybe it's just this bot player who knows i'll try uploading it in the am
2010-11-08T23:43:28  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: but thats probably not what C returns - its defined in the C standard for the constant EOF

2010-11-08T23:43:40  <demerzel_> i am totally out of energy on this - 4+ hours of googling +c +stdin + piped +help
2010-11-08T23:44:02  <raedwulf> my problems only lasted 2 hours :S
2010-11-08T23:44:09  <lavalamp_> ok
2010-11-08T23:44:38  <demerzel_> lucky
2010-11-08T23:44:43  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: you never get EOF anyway
2010-11-08T23:44:44  <demerzel_> i never thought i'd get a hangup on stdin ffs
2010-11-08T23:44:56  <demerzel_> typed to it etc to make sure it was working
2010-11-08T23:44:58  <raedwulf> its useful for self-testing but the engine will never give you EOF - it just kills it
2010-11-08T23:45:00  <lavalamp_> http://pastebin.com/sCzuNrJp
2010-11-08T23:45:04  <demerzel_> and hey it is ok then
2010-11-08T23:45:08  <lavalamp_> see if that program fails for you
2010-11-08T23:45:38  <lavalamp_> I piped a big replay file through it and it seemed to work fine
2010-11-08T23:46:04  <demerzel_> well it breaks in windows and on the main server :(
2010-11-08T23:46:09  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: usually piping works because its faster than what the engine sends through
2010-11-08T23:46:16  <lavalamp_> at the end it started spitting out eofs which is why I asked
2010-11-08T23:46:19  <demerzel_> but maybe doing it one char at a time + turning buffer off will make ti work on the server at least
2010-11-08T23:46:37  <lavalamp_> raedwulf ok I'll test that
2010-11-08T23:47:54  <raedwulf> demerzel_: http://pastebin.ca/1986003
2010-11-08T23:48:16  <raedwulf> http://pastebin.ca/1986004
2010-11-08T23:49:14  <demerzel_> what is that i thought you used fgets
2010-11-08T23:49:42  <raedwulf> demerzel_: check the first pastebin
2010-11-08T23:49:50  <raedwulf> first pastebin is part of the "driver"
2010-11-08T23:49:59  <raedwulf> and then protocol_parse is just what i use for parsing
2010-11-08T23:50:05  <demerzel_> oh right
2010-11-08T23:50:09  <demerzel_> yea that looks a lot like mine
2010-11-08T23:50:14  <demerzel_> why not scanf?  lol
2010-11-08T23:50:49  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.91.23> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-08T23:51:03  <raedwulf> i suppose i could have done that
2010-11-08T23:51:28  <raedwulf> but this solution worked ^^
2010-11-08T23:51:32  <demerzel_> http://pastebin.com/ng711edr this what parseline feeds
2010-11-08T23:51:36  <demerzel_> so it's doing parsing per line like yours
2010-11-08T23:53:00  <demerzel_> my original solution ws exactly yours in fact
2010-11-08T23:53:09  <demerzel_> one line fgets ok that was easy
2010-11-08T23:53:21  <demerzel_> then i uploaded it and it crashed and i was like wtf and ran it through bot tester and it crashed
2010-11-08T23:53:49  <demerzel_> so i took state and parsing out of the equation completely and it still crashe
2010-11-08T23:54:05  <McLeopold> I accidently modified the wrong version of my code.
2010-11-08T23:54:10  <McLeopold> Now I'm merging...
2010-11-08T23:54:26  <McLeopold> ...and I don't remember writing this stuff. O_o
2010-11-08T23:54:47  <demerzel_> yea i did that a few times
2010-11-08T23:54:49  <McLeopold> But, it's brilliant!
2010-11-08T23:54:57  <raedwulf> demerzel_: :S
2010-11-08T23:55:02  <demerzel_> god this is so stupid and yet completely blocking me from doing anything
2010-11-08T23:55:11  <raedwulf> i know my code works because it works fine with rage bot thats still running on the main server
2010-11-08T23:55:25  <demerzel_> well wtf then
2010-11-08T23:55:30  <McLeopold> demerzel_: it's just your parsing code, and that's it?
2010-11-08T23:55:37  <demerzel_> it's crashing on the server i have the exact same code except with an fgets
2010-11-08T23:55:52  <raedwulf> demerzel_: checked the buffer size?
2010-11-08T23:55:57  <raedwulf> no buffer overflow?
2010-11-08T23:56:05  <demerzel_> i have mine at 128 per line
2010-11-08T23:56:09  <raedwulf> should be enough
2010-11-08T23:56:15  <raedwulf> hmm
2010-11-08T23:56:22  <demerzel_> what is 'line' in your implementation
2010-11-08T23:56:33  <raedwulf> remember windows doesn't prompt for memory bugs as often as linux
2010-11-08T23:56:57  <raedwulf> char line[PROTOCOL_LINE_LENGTH];
2010-11-08T23:56:59  <demerzel_> my code on the server is one line - fgets(stdin, 128, io_output)
2010-11-08T23:57:16  <demerzel_> ah ok so just like mine except with a define
2010-11-08T23:57:19  <demerzel_> well then i really have no damn idea
2010-11-08T23:57:29  <raedwulf> demerzel_: stdin is defined in the C headers
2010-11-08T23:57:38  <raedwulf> not wise to override that name
2010-11-08T23:57:50  <demerzel_> i even ran splint on it
2010-11-08T23:57:52  <demerzel_> lol
2010-11-08T23:58:00  <raedwulf> you sure thats the correct line?
2010-11-08T23:58:14  <raedwulf> char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);
2010-11-08T23:58:24  <raedwulf> stream should be at the end of the function
2010-11-08T23:58:29  <demerzel_> no i just typed that up
2010-11-08T23:58:32  <raedwulf> ok
2010-11-08T23:58:34  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-11-08T23:58:45  <demerzel_> ah yes then fgets(io_output, 128, stdin)
2010-11-08T23:58:56  <demerzel_> lemme make sure that isn't the only problem cuz then i'll feel stupid but at least i'm done lol
