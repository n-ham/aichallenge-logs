2011-12-06T00:08:18  <rwest_> basically my ants just move toward enemy when they outnumber them

2011-12-06T01:54:19  <McLeopold> I was thinking of some 5 players where that was true
2011-12-06T01:54:27  <McLeopold> which is slightly more noteworthy
2011-12-06T01:54:48  <McLeopold> so, janzert, how are we doing?
2011-12-06T01:55:38  <janzert> I'm doing fine :)
2011-12-06T01:56:17  <McLeopold> like this http://aichallenge.org/map.php?map=cell_maze/cell_maze_p05_19.map
2011-12-06T01:56:50  <janzert> yeah, that's a little more interesting case :)
2011-12-06T01:57:33  <McLeopold> I produce a list of symmetric points, then get the distances, the find the set with the smallest stdev
2011-12-06T01:57:51  <McLeopold> it ends up picking very fair hill placements
2011-12-06T01:58:00  <McLeopold> but just for the first hill
2011-12-06T01:59:09  <janzert> just so the placement doesn't get too predictable
2011-12-06T01:59:26  <McLeopold> only from the perspective if you know the map
2011-12-06T01:59:54  <McLeopold> in cell maze, you aren't going to be next to water, but that's just the map type
2011-12-06T02:00:24  <McLeopold> plus, sometimes the map doesn't have very even points, so I just pick the best one

2011-12-06T02:00:53  <McLeopold> I'm wondering if some type of ticket system would be better

2011-12-06T02:02:05  <McLeopold> maybe the answer is more games and it all goes away
2011-12-06T02:02:30  <janzert> yeah, more games/less resource intensive game would solve most of it
2011-12-06T02:02:33  <McLeopold> it's amazing how hard the problem is

2011-12-06T03:58:46  <antimatroid> i watched the entire thing without the second visualisations
2011-12-06T03:58:49  <antimatroid> and was like wtf is this shit :P
2011-12-06T03:58:50  <pairofdice> ohhh
2011-12-06T03:58:56  <McLeopold> oh, it is
2011-12-06T03:59:04  <McLeopold> but I've got 1 cool feature
2011-12-06T03:59:07  <antimatroid> that's neat
2011-12-06T03:59:35  <pairofdice> Traveling ant
2011-12-06T03:59:56  <McLeopold> ant predicted spawn ant
2011-12-06T04:00:00  <McLeopold> and
2011-12-06T04:00:17  <antimatroid> i gave up on predicting spawning
2011-12-06T04:00:23  <McLeopold> how come?
2011-12-06T04:00:24  <antimatroid> it's too messy with the random tiebreak :P
2011-12-06T04:00:41  <McLeopold> oh, I just assume every hill gets a spawn
2011-12-06T04:01:05  <antimatroid> i'd prefer not to rely on a ant ant coming to exist near a hill
2011-12-06T04:01:16  <antimatroid> least i try and use that for defense and it never shows
2011-12-06T04:01:34  <pairofdice> Assume a hill gets a spawn with a 1/hills probability!
2011-12-06T04:01:39  <McLeopold> turn 45 is nice
2011-12-06T04:01:46  <McLeopold> I only sent 1 ant south for 2 food
2011-12-06T04:02:16  <pairofdice> Yeah, I was working on something similar
2011-12-06T04:03:49  <McLeopold> although, it went to the wrong side of the food...
2011-12-06T04:14:52  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.15479 interesting game, score at the end it looks like cowbandit razed X32's hill and other bots did nothing

2011-12-06T04:29:08  <willem> has anyone had problems with the remaining time? I set my bot to quit when theres 150 ms left but it seems to time out.
2011-12-06T04:29:24  <thestinger> willem: on tcp?
2011-12-06T04:29:54  <willem> thestinger: nah when submitting
2011-12-06T04:30:06  <thestinger> oh, no then
2011-12-06T04:30:10  <thestinger> you might have loops that never finish
2011-12-06T04:30:20  <thestinger> or algorithms that have really bad worse cases
2011-12-06T04:31:31  <willem> Strange because on my pc, it always exits at most 10ms after the limit I set.
2011-12-06T04:31:45  <thestinger> on a huge map with lots of ants?
2011-12-06T04:31:51  <thestinger> 10ms might be ~40ms on the server
2011-12-06T04:31:59  <thestinger> and sometimes it might be a lot more than that
2011-12-06T04:32:31  <willem> Well it is dependent on the number of ants so it might be that.
2011-12-06T04:33:42  <willem> It is quite hard to guess a good limit though :) I'm just setting it to some number and seeing from the results if it does a time-out or not.

2011-12-06T07:52:11  <antimatroid> i thought that started in january?
2011-12-06T07:52:14  <antimatroid> or are you at stanford? :P
2011-12-06T07:52:18  <Anilm3> nope
2011-12-06T07:52:33  <Anilm3> ml started on september/october
2011-12-06T07:52:39  <antimatroid> oh, maybe they're just doing it again
2011-12-06T07:52:46  <Anilm3> exactly
2011-12-06T07:52:57  <pairofdice> Yeah
2011-12-06T07:53:02  <antimatroid> i was worried i missed it for a second :P
2011-12-06T07:53:08  <Anilm3> :P
2011-12-06T07:53:33  <Anilm3> pgm sounds great also
2011-12-06T07:53:36  <pairofdice> ml course kinda meh imo ;p (Can't fit it into my brain)
2011-12-06T07:53:39  <antimatroid> a1k0n is the only person i've seen succeed while doing cool things that didn't involve game trees
2011-12-06T07:53:44  <antimatroid> so i think i need to hop on the ml train :P

2011-12-06T07:54:24  <pairofdice> You probably can
2011-12-06T07:54:31  <Anilm3> antimatroid: free-ml is not hard
2011-12-06T07:54:47  <Anilm3> the math level required is quite low
2011-12-06T07:54:49  <antimatroid> Anilm3: can you do the assignments in any language? or more specifically can i use c++?
2011-12-06T07:54:52  <antimatroid> hmm that sucks
2011-12-06T07:54:55  <Anilm3> octave
2011-12-06T07:54:57  <antimatroid> but understandable i guess
2011-12-06T07:55:04  <pairofdice> The material is provided in octave
2011-12-06T07:55:44  <Anilm3> antimatroid: octave is great for this stuff, I think you wont miss C++

2011-12-06T07:56:25  <antimatroid> i have seen like 3 in the last hour walking around
2011-12-06T07:56:41  <Anilm3> antimatroid: I think you can still register to this semester class
2011-12-06T07:56:51  <antimatroid> i'm quite busy atm anyway
2011-12-06T07:56:55  <antimatroid> january sounds good
2011-12-06T07:57:09  <Anilm3> Just for the purpose of taking a look on the material www.ml-class.org
2011-12-06T07:57:11  <antimatroid> maybe pgm would have more maths?
2011-12-06T07:57:25  <Anilm3> I hope so
2011-12-06T07:58:21  <Anilm3> antimatroid: at first I was a bit pissed with the low math level, but since I'm learning a lot, it doesn't matter anymore
2011-12-06T07:58:44  <Anilm3> antimatroid: you can still follow the original ml class, videos and materials are open

2011-12-06T08:00:37  <antimatroid> there's no good game theory things online if you want above a beginner level which sucks
2011-12-06T08:00:41  <pairofdice> I do like the ai class a lot
2011-12-06T08:00:58  <antimatroid> there's some notes on mit for grad courses but until you know the material from other places they don't really explain anything
2011-12-06T08:01:12  <antimatroid> i'm fairly good with game theory now though

2011-12-06T08:34:29  <Minthos> it's 64 bit linux of course, but should be suitably mediocre to be useless as a submission
2011-12-06T08:36:20  <bqf> AntDroid: you can use some of the example bots or old versions of your own bot for local testing; running binaries someone else gives you can be dangerous and i definitely would not recommend it.

2011-12-06T08:39:14  <AntDroid> bqf: example bots are not that good, old versions of my bot just keeps on drawing the new bot due to similarity, much older versions are no good also

2011-12-06T12:45:59  <ikaros> a1k0n, keep in mind that some bots probably use the wrong time limit on fluxid
2011-12-06T12:46:16  <a1k0n> i'm removing code, not adding!@!
2011-12-06T12:46:30  <a1k0n> this was an earlier experiment
2011-12-06T12:46:51  <lethlawire> I've gotten this : "	Compiling: compiling and running tests" Since last night. Should the tests have started already?
2011-12-06T12:47:09  <a1k0n> yeah, that should last seconds
2011-12-06T12:47:46  <rwest> In Game: Playing in a game right now.
2011-12-06T12:47:51  <rwest> first time I have seen that heh
2011-12-06T12:48:32  <Antimony> a1k0n, do you try to estimate number of enemy ants?
2011-12-06T12:49:18  <a1k0n> no, i just count the ones i can see
2011-12-06T12:49:21  <lethlawire> Darn. I've had problems since I've started. Last night I kept getting the "Unpack error:" and aamstan fixed this. But now I just get the "Compiling" result. And all I'm doing is reuploading the package I downloaded for the 5 minute tutorial!
2011-12-06T12:49:45  <Antimony> So you decide how much losses are worth based on enemies you can see only?
2011-12-06T12:50:03  <a1k0n> well, yes.
2011-12-06T12:50:15  <Antimony> I've been thinking about trying to estimate enemy ants, since I'm worried that will fail miesrably in a defender situation
2011-12-06T12:50:17  <a1k0n> my bot is pretty stupid; it deserves to be slaughtered
2011-12-06T12:50:24  <Antimony> if you can't see most of the map the bot gets overoptimistic
2011-12-06T12:50:25  <rwest> lol
2011-12-06T12:50:26  <Antimony> oh
2011-12-06T12:50:34  <Antimony> well your bot is a lot higher ranked than me
2011-12-06T12:50:39  <Anilm3> wow my bot is getting cooler on his own!
2011-12-06T12:50:46  <a1k0n> not anymore
2011-12-06T12:50:57  <Antimony> that's only because you resubmitted
2011-12-06T12:51:05  <Antimony> it will be up there again in a couple games

2011-12-06T12:51:30  <Antimony> By bot has never even broken mu=85, and yours was at 91 several versions ago
2011-12-06T12:51:42  <BenJackson> I'm down to 8th but mainly because the average skill in the top 10 is going up quite a bit
2011-12-06T12:52:03  <BenJackson> more top bots are floating up the average
2011-12-06T12:52:28  <Antimony> I really need to figure out combat soon
2011-12-06T12:52:41  <BenJackson> used to be a ton of bots in the 83.xx and it's evening out as we all play games
2011-12-06T12:53:13  <rwest> the only reason I win any games on the official server is by numbers of ants
2011-12-06T12:53:17  <a1k0n> i shoudln't have resubmitted since i think my new bot is actually worse

2011-12-06T12:54:26  <Anilm3> re-resubmit
2011-12-06T12:54:36  <a1k0n> then it'll just be worse again
2011-12-06T12:55:06  <Anilm3> then resumbit your old version..
2011-12-06T12:55:11  <Anilm3> sumbit*
2011-12-06T12:55:32  <a1k0n> but it could be worse than what's up there, i can't actually tell
2011-12-06T12:55:57  <Anilm3> At my level is much easier..
2011-12-06T12:57:31  <Anilm3> I usually evaluate my bots against each other
2011-12-06T12:58:13  <rwest> Anilm3: when I do that, my v2 bot wins half the time
2011-12-06T12:58:21  <Antimony> same with me
2011-12-06T12:58:25  <rwest> it's the current main counter to my current bot
2011-12-06T12:58:32  <Anilm3> In my case, my last bot is the best one
2011-12-06T12:58:38  <rwest> since it pretty much just suicides on your hill
2011-12-06T12:58:49  <Antimony> once you've got a decent bot, testing it against old versions isn't useful anymore
2011-12-06T12:59:09  <Anilm3> so my bot's not decent then..
2011-12-06T12:59:43  <Anilm3> I'm not even near the top 100
2011-12-06T13:00:09  <Antimony> getting into the top 100 is hard nowadays
2011-12-06T13:00:17  <Antimony> mine is barely 90
2011-12-06T13:00:37  <Antimony> I desperately need combat skills
2011-12-06T13:01:54  <Anilm3> I need skills

2011-12-06T13:06:09  <Anilm3> a1k0n: how can I make multiple ants go to a same goal without doing pathfinding on each ant?
2011-12-06T13:06:55  <Anilm3> a1k0n  or whoever has an answer and is willing to share ^^
2011-12-06T13:07:14  <a1k0n> pathfind from the goal?
2011-12-06T13:07:23  <Anilm3> to each ant?
2011-12-06T13:07:33  <a1k0n> to the whole map, via a bfs search
2011-12-06T13:07:48  <Anilm3> that's also costly isn't it?
2011-12-06T13:07:50  <a1k0n> then each ant checks each way it can go and goes the closest way
2011-12-06T13:07:55  <a1k0n> how many goals do you have?
2011-12-06T13:08:02  <Anilm3> Mainly hills
2011-12-06T13:08:09  <Anilm3> for food I just do A*
2011-12-06T13:08:21  <Anilm3> but I want multiple ants to go and raze hills
2011-12-06T13:08:23  <a1k0n> so seed a bfs search with all the hills, and then have each ant go towards the closest hill
2011-12-06T13:08:41  <Anilm3> interesting, thanks

2011-12-06T13:55:13  <Conorach> also, as explained in the thread: beta was actually open for everybody.
2011-12-06T13:55:22  <Conorach> so if you knew about the contest in June you could have joined by then.
2011-12-06T13:55:25  <BenJackson> for what it's worth I started on about Oct 23
2011-12-06T13:55:35  <Conorach> other people might be sad they join now, instead of at the end of October.
2011-12-06T13:55:58  <Conorach> Other people are without a life and work on their bot 60 hours a week, while others have to scrap together a few precious hours to be able to work on it.
2011-12-06T13:56:45  <BenJackson> some people also have a more relevant programming background
2011-12-06T13:56:50  <BenJackson> some people know more suitable programming languages
2011-12-06T13:57:06  <Conorach> Ah good point too Ben :)
2011-12-06T13:57:10  <BenJackson> some people have friends to bounce non-public ideas off of
2011-12-06T13:58:13  <Garf> the last winner was a professional AI developer, with a good knowledge of one of the fastest dynamic languages, and even the maintainer of the compiler so he could work around known bugs on the contest servers
2011-12-06T13:58:33  <Garf> that's unfair :-P
2011-12-06T13:58:59  <Conorach> well, I am not sure that is totally unfair.

2011-12-06T13:59:21  <BenJackson> I entered the ICFP many years ago and lost to a team of grad students and their advisors who had developed a C langauge extension ideal for the challenge
2011-12-06T13:59:24  <Conorach> or join an open source project to write compilers :P
2011-12-06T13:59:32  <BenJackson> (and the big team was more significant because it was a 3-day contest)
2011-12-06T13:59:33  <Anilm3> Yeah, I was only talking about the time factor
2011-12-06T13:59:37  <BenJackson> but I still had fun and learned a lot

2011-12-06T14:00:04  <BenJackson> depending on the day :)
2011-12-06T14:02:17  <BenJackson> amstan: as a control you guys should submit a "last place" bot.  it would find one of the initial food and then return to suicide with the new ant as fast as possible
2011-12-06T14:02:36  <BenJackson> if that doesn't come in dead last then thre's probably a bug in the contest :)
2011-12-06T14:02:44  <Garf> BenJackson: timeout on turn 1?
2011-12-06T14:02:53  <amstan> BenJackson: huh?
2011-12-06T14:02:56  <Garf> ah wait, then you can still kill 1 attacking ant
2011-12-06T14:02:58  <amstan> why?
2011-12-06T14:04:00  <Minthos> no points are awarded for killing ants

2011-12-06T14:44:49  <ikaros> a1k0n, i have a question regarding you forum post. when you simulate moves.. say you have 3 ants at positions (a_0,b_0,c_0).. you move them randomly to new positions (a_1,b_1,c_1).. in the next iteration you continue to move them from *_0 or _1
2011-12-06T14:45:01  <ikaros> i hope i explained that right :)
2011-12-06T14:46:00  <rwest> ikaros: I would think it would be systematically rather than randomly
2011-12-06T14:46:35  <ikaros> or in other words.. in every iteration of the simulation, each ant has max dist of 1 to its origin at iteration 0
2011-12-06T14:46:51  <ikaros> rwest, that's not what i meant.
2011-12-06T14:47:24  <ikaros> yes you choose the best of 5 directions so its not random.. used the wrong words :)

2011-12-06T15:36:11  <besh> what i don't understand: a) is there evaluation ? b) is there a tree ?
2011-12-06T15:37:25  <ikaros> a) yes b) no
2011-12-06T15:37:39  <ikaros> you move the ants one after the other in all possible directions
2011-12-06T15:37:47  <ikaros> and for each move you evaluate
2011-12-06T15:38:23  <besh> ok. how do you evaluate? ant count ?
2011-12-06T15:38:34  <ikaros> well evaluation is black magic :)
2011-12-06T15:38:42  <ikaros> you can do several things
2011-12-06T15:38:53  <ikaros> from ant counting to distance to specific targets
2011-12-06T15:39:19  <besh> ok. so is it a one ply monte-carlo sampling ?
2011-12-06T15:39:27  <ikaros> or some kind of unseen tiles bonus
2011-12-06T15:39:41  <ikaros> this is up to everyone i guess .. to find a good evaluation
2011-12-06T15:39:57  <ikaros> its not really one ply as far is i understand it
2011-12-06T15:40:10  <ikaros> because you move your ants repeatedly until time runs out
2011-12-06T15:40:18  <besh> can it find tactics like cornering an ant in a 2 vs 1 situation which could require 3 steps lookahead f.i.
2011-12-06T15:41:01  <besh> yes you move your ants repeatedly but all of them at the root as far as I understood.
2011-12-06T15:41:04  <ikaros> if i understand it right.. you could.. accidentally or by having the evaluation function "detect corners"
2011-12-06T15:41:12  <ikaros> but i think that would be kinda hard
2011-12-06T15:41:30  <ikaros> besh yea that was one thing i wasnt sure myself so far
2011-12-06T15:41:53  <ikaros> but i agree.. i think you move them at a distance of max 1 to their origin always

2011-12-06T15:43:40  <ikaros> but you could always include something like attack and defense vectors in your eval function
2011-12-06T15:43:42  <ikaros> e.g.
2011-12-06T15:43:50  <ikaros> i have no idea if this would be performant..
2011-12-06T15:45:33  <besh> i think it can be helpful to mix different strategies if you have a lot. When tactics is involved (face to face with enemy ants), that dominates.
2011-12-06T15:46:51  <besh> i suspect xathis does at least a 2-ply lookahead. Some of the 2 vs 1 situations I observed are impossible to guess with simple rules.

2011-12-06T15:50:48  <ikaros> you can also do it with ants moving more than distance 1
2011-12-06T15:50:55  <besh> But i probably run out of time in 3-4 iterations though.

2011-12-06T15:52:53  <ikaros> is your eval function very complex?
2011-12-06T15:53:29  <ikaros> if not id try to benchmark making moves only without eval and try to optimize the data structure you use
2011-12-06T15:54:25  <besh> i don't have eval. I just do move orders in pre-determined order like in the tutorials.

2011-12-06T16:01:23  <a1k0n> you don't move your ants more than one square away from where they started

2011-12-06T16:01:31  <ikaros> ok thx
2011-12-06T16:01:46  <ikaros> based on that i have another question :)
2011-12-06T16:01:56  <besh> a1kon: thanks. How does it perform regarding tactics ?
2011-12-06T16:02:18  <a1k0n> it isn't smart enough to know it's going to chase ants into a wall, but it will do it anyway
2011-12-06T16:02:23  <ikaros> like in my example above.. you move ants (a_0,b_0,c_0) to (a_1,b_1,c_1)
2011-12-06T16:02:32  <ikaros> then on the next iteration
2011-12-06T16:02:54  <ikaros> a moves from a_0 again but the others are still at _1, right?
2011-12-06T16:03:19  <a1k0n> a moves from a_1 to some other place, possibly a_0 again
2011-12-06T16:03:45  <ikaros> hmm but if it moves from the target it could move 2 tiles away from the origin
2011-12-06T16:03:55  <a1k0n> oh
2011-12-06T16:04:01  <a1k0n> oh, right.  it moves from a_0 again, yes.
2011-12-06T16:04:06  <ikaros> ok
2011-12-06T16:04:20  <besh> a1kon: I understand that it is useful for mixing different strategies but I thought it was mainly for resolving combat guessing from the tile of the trhead.
2011-12-06T16:04:22  <ikaros> but you cant really be sure there are no collisions in the end?!

2011-12-06T16:05:22  <a1k0n> so if a moves right and b moves to where a was already, then a can't later decide to not move
2011-12-06T16:05:31  <a1k0n> (unless b moves away again)
2011-12-06T16:05:51  <ikaros> but i check collisions only in the current state? so there is no guarentee my highest sample will lead to an unoccupied tile in the end
2011-12-06T16:05:58  <ikaros> or im getting something really wrong
2011-12-06T16:05:58  <a1k0n> besh: it's kinda for both.  without an opponent, you don't need to do any of the fancy stuff
2011-12-06T16:06:02  <ikaros> (probably)
2011-12-06T16:06:28  <a1k0n> well, whenever you move an ant provisionally, mark the tile they're going to be
2011-12-06T16:06:33  <ikaros> yea
2011-12-06T16:06:36  <a1k0n> and whenever you geenrate moves, check that no ant is going there

2011-12-06T16:09:21  <a1k0n> right

2011-12-06T16:09:40  <a1k0n> yeah, but the best one can be obscured by an ant being in the way from previous sampling
2011-12-06T16:09:40  <ikaros> but couldnt it be two ants choose the same target then?
2011-12-06T16:09:51  <BenJackson> a1k0n: the latest post on the forum is thikning you are simulating multiple moves *into the future*
2011-12-06T16:09:52  <a1k0n> well, one of them has to choose somewhere else

2011-12-06T16:13:04  <a1k0n> ideally, yes.  i'm not sure how to implement UCT in this case
2011-12-06T16:13:48  <besh> I would think the evaluation has to guess the best opponent response as there are no terminal positions here.
2011-12-06T16:14:02  <a1k0n> right.
2011-12-06T16:14:16  <a1k0n> well, unless you count "enough ants died" as terminal
2011-12-06T16:14:36  <a1k0n> but yes, it'd be impossible to simulate the game all the way through to all hills being taken
2011-12-06T16:14:57  <besh> yes there could be a threshold that flags a position as practically won for one side or the other.
2011-12-06T16:15:37  <ikaros> couldnt you do a monte carlo tree search until a max number of plys and then evaluate
2011-12-06T16:15:41  <besh> Before I knew you can monte-carlo to the end of the game, I used something similar for 9-9 go.
2011-12-06T16:16:29  <BenJackson> go solvers can see the end of a 9x9 go game from the start??
2011-12-06T16:16:44  <ikaros> go ai simulates whole games yes
2011-12-06T16:16:53  <ikaros> the monte carlo approaches at least
2011-12-06T16:16:59  <besh> yes if you do random moves that is.
2011-12-06T16:17:58  <a1k0n> i never got to try multiple-move lookahead with ants.  it's a little tricky to implement the state, but probably worth doing
2011-12-06T16:18:07  <BenJackson> in the pousse contest years ago I had no idea how to play at all but I needed a starting move
2011-12-06T16:18:17  <BenJackson> so I ran my minmax on the largest game I could see clear to the end
2011-12-06T16:18:25  <BenJackson> and extrapolated that move to larger boards
2011-12-06T16:18:44  <BenJackson> but it was only 4x4 or something
2011-12-06T16:19:39  <BenJackson> a1k0n: if I looked ahead more moves I'd somehow have to trade that cost off against looking at the 1 move

2011-12-06T16:23:09  <BenJackson> what really helped the winners in that one was avoiding recalculating from known board positions
2011-12-06T16:23:29  <BenJackson> I pondered that for this game but it would be much more complex
2011-12-06T16:25:56  <besh> a1kon: one reason why I shouldn't have started with starter package. If I had enough time to start by myself, first thing I would implement those trick combat rules.

2011-12-06T16:31:12  <besh> The starter packages do not allow to temporarliy move ants for lookaheads. a1kon's and similar methods require that.
2011-12-06T16:31:40  <BenJackson> oh
2011-12-06T16:31:58  <BenJackson> I think the data structures for combat are key to the implementation
2011-12-06T16:32:05  <BenJackson> I don't think any reasonable starter could reflect that
2011-12-06T16:32:19  <BenJackson> mine look nothing like a grid of ants...
2011-12-06T16:33:02  <besh> yes. I would have to rewrite a lot of stuff to get that working. But I didn't have high ambitions when I started :)
2011-12-06T16:34:11  <a1k0n> all i did was add some stuff to Square.h
2011-12-06T16:34:14  <a1k0n> it's not that hard

2011-12-06T16:37:10  <besh> The java one has list for ants and hills a. And also determining which ants get captured is not easy.
2011-12-06T16:37:45  <besh> All moves should be made to determine which ants get captured.
2011-12-06T16:38:14  <rwest> besh: you don't want to do combat calculations on all ants
2011-12-06T16:38:21  <rwest> well I wouldn't

2011-12-06T16:39:00  <a1k0n> so yes, you need to maintain the set of enemy ants which have entered the combat radius of each ant
2011-12-06T16:40:01  <besh> yes exactly. You implemented it so you know better :)
2011-12-06T16:40:45  <besh> the rule that says "our ant should be less distracted than the ant we are attacking" is difficult.
2011-12-06T16:40:56  <a1k0n> it is
2011-12-06T16:45:15  <BenJackson> ahh shit
2011-12-06T16:45:19  <BenJackson> I just found a huge bug
2011-12-06T16:45:23  <BenJackson> or possibly a huge feature
2011-12-06T16:45:57  <BenJackson> speaking of "random heuristics"
2011-12-06T16:46:41  <a1k0n> move_score = rand()?
2011-12-06T16:46:43  <BenJackson> if I go from seeing enemy hills to not seeing any enemy hills I have stale hill proximity data until I see another hill
2011-12-06T16:47:06  <BenJackson> I fixed this incidentally but then "failed" my regression check against a test game
2011-12-06T16:47:19  <Garf> I implemented the code from the spec page exactly
2011-12-06T16:48:13  <Garf> this requires a per-ant gathering of neighbours in attack range

2011-12-06T17:38:01  <LouisMartin> to add the optimization flag to the C# compilation.
2011-12-06T17:40:13  <LouisMartin> now I need to create a pull request with that change, but I'm not used to Git. I create a new branch, make the change and then do a pull request on this branch?  not even sure it makes sense

2011-12-06T17:44:28  <amstan> only 3 workers online? weird

2011-12-06T17:45:53  <amstan> BenJackson: no, each worker recompiles on their own space, new workers means more compiling
2011-12-06T17:46:07  <LouisMartin> "--optimize=MODE , -O=MODE.  MODE  is  a  comma  separated  list of optimizations.  They also  allow optimizations to be turned off by prefixing the  optimization name with a minus sign."
2011-12-06T17:46:35  <amstan> unless you think you're in a better position to play a game, in that case resubmit so you get new games
2011-12-06T17:46:38  <LouisMartin> so, --optimize=all  or  -O=all  .. yep.

2011-12-06T17:52:10  <amstan> janzert: i noticed
2011-12-06T17:52:14  <janzert> you did update the worker tarball right?
2011-12-06T17:52:14  <amstan> lol
2011-12-06T17:52:23  <amstan> how?
2011-12-06T17:52:32  <amstan> i've never done it
2011-12-06T17:52:48  <janzert> from the aichallenge directory run setup/create_worker_setup.py website/
2011-12-06T17:52:55  <janzert> I can do it
2011-12-06T17:53:04  <amstan> i already have a shell
2011-12-06T17:53:06  <janzert> but means the workers are still running the old code
2011-12-06T17:53:42  <janzert> I'll wait a bit to manually restart them since the spot price has been jumping around anyway
2011-12-06T17:53:45  <amstan> i need to change worker_ssh -r to ping in reverse orde so i can kill it
2011-12-06T17:53:52  <janzert> :)
2011-12-06T17:54:05  <janzert> or only ping workers that have had a game in the last week or something
2011-12-06T17:54:32  <amstan> janzert: nope, worker 510 is back
2011-12-06T17:54:48  <amstan> host key verification failed though
2011-12-06T17:55:07  <amstan> it's another worker with the same ip but different os
2011-12-06T17:55:16  <janzert> i.e. someone elses server
2011-12-06T17:55:24  <amstan> nope
2011-12-06T17:55:26  <amstan> it's ours
2011-12-06T17:55:30  <amstan> i can login to it
2011-12-06T17:55:44  <amstan> it's just that i've logged in to another server we had on the same ip
2011-12-06T17:55:51  <janzert> ahh, yes
2011-12-06T17:56:03  <amstan> shouldn't it have a different key in the db?
2011-12-06T17:56:09  <janzert> nope
2011-12-06T17:56:23  <janzert> key is by ip
2011-12-06T17:56:50  <janzert> worker_ssh would have found 510 if only querying servers within past week though
2011-12-06T17:57:02  <amstan> it already did
2011-12-06T17:57:07  <amstan> but it's actually a new server
2011-12-06T17:57:10  <amstan> but it has an old id
2011-12-06T17:57:14  <janzert> that's fine
2011-12-06T17:57:15  <amstan> because of same ip stuff
2011-12-06T17:57:31  <amstan> so why not restart now? what does spot prices have to do with restarting?
2011-12-06T17:57:54  <janzert> amazon will probably be restarting anyway and if we restart we pay for the remainder of the hour
2011-12-06T17:58:09  <amstan> i see
2011-12-06T17:58:11  <amstan> ok
2011-12-06T17:58:13  <janzert> I normally time restarts so they fall at the end of the hour charge
2011-12-06T17:58:27  <janzert> not that it's a big cost :)
2011-12-06T18:02:07  <BenJackson> it's too bad time controls are baked into every bot
2011-12-06T18:02:14  <BenJackson> it would have been worth reworking the engine to use cpu time

2011-12-06T18:26:42  <McLeopold> if we start the next contest backend in django, I'd probably like to see the beta period use ants
2011-12-06T18:27:05  <amstan> at least until we get a new game
2011-12-06T18:27:09  <Friblurks> are these contests once a year?
2011-12-06T18:27:16  <McLeopold> meaning you could still write and submit bots and we could keep the top 100 going
2011-12-06T18:27:49  <McLeopold> amstan: I'm thinking switch to django, then design a new game, to shorten the period that everyone works on the next game
2011-12-06T18:28:02  <retybok_> Any idea what the next game will be?
2011-12-06T18:28:14  <amstan> retybok_: depends on the suggestions
2011-12-06T18:28:19  <amstan> but no

2011-12-06T18:40:03  <Mystret> what about the next contest/future of aichallenge then? i saw a post about zeta on the forums (the roadmap), but that one dated back to january
2011-12-06T18:40:10  <Mystret> is there an updated roadmap available somewhere?

2011-12-06T18:44:22  <Friblurks> mine probably isn't far off
2011-12-06T18:46:18  <BenJackson> mine tends to win or get 0

2011-12-06T18:48:27  <McLeopold> I think jbroman and I both worked on the same thing in different ways
2011-12-06T18:48:33  <McLeopold> we'll have to choose one
2011-12-06T18:49:04  <bluegaspode> Some help with the bots needed: can I have a data file in my bots submission?
2011-12-06T18:49:20  <McLeopold> bluegaspode: yes
2011-12-06T18:49:51  <bluegaspode> where do I need to put it?
2011-12-06T18:49:57  <Fluxid> oh boy, few changes and fixes and my current version totally pwns older one... i'll test it on tcp later
2011-12-06T18:50:50  <bluegaspode> (for a Java bot)
2011-12-06T18:51:05  <amstan> bluegaspode: it depends on your code
2011-12-06T18:51:30  <AntDroid> http://tcpants.com/replay.5182 my bot is starting to behave like a top bot. beating bugnuts here. :)
2011-12-06T18:52:09  <bluegaspode> Initially I tried to load via classpath (as the file was just contained in the package) - but this didn't work - as I guess the Java files are all put into a jar - put not my *.txt file
2011-12-06T18:52:23  <Fluxid> h
2011-12-06T18:52:34  <Fluxid> hm, loads slowly for me
2011-12-06T18:53:18  <bugnuts> everybody picks on me - I have a very friendly bot.  you should leave me alone.
2011-12-06T18:53:40  <Fluxid> AntDroid: you pause when your weakness == enemy weakness?
2011-12-06T18:53:52  <amstan> your jar is going to be in the same folder as the stuff that you provide, so if you have the jar path somewhere, use that to get to your data file
2011-12-06T18:53:58  <amstan> bugnuts: man., i know!
2011-12-06T18:54:19  <amstan> every time i play capture the flag, people keep shooting me, i'm not violent though, all i'm trying to do is carry this red flag
2011-12-06T18:54:53  <Fluxid> :)))
2011-12-06T18:54:57  <bluegaspode> So I guess I need to load my data file via absolut path - but I'd need to now how the directory structure will look like on the server. Is the zip just unzipped and the compiled bot.jar added?
2011-12-06T18:55:21  <AntDroid> bugnuts: your bot still beat mine most of the time, just happy with that rare game where i won. :)
2011-12-06T18:56:17  <AntDroid> Fluxid: yes. i'm still tweaking it though. my problem now is that a lot of ants get stuck defending in just one direction
2011-12-06T18:56:19  <bugnuts> I think the version I am running there is actually sort of irrationally aggressive, which means I lose a lot but high variance
2011-12-06T18:57:35  <AntDroid> it is still very strong though. it tends to dominate the game by sheer number.
2011-12-06T18:58:04  <Fluxid> i've added a little aggressivness today
2011-12-06T18:58:22  <Fluxid> really small and dumb aggressive neuron
2011-12-06T18:59:17  <Fluxid> http://fluxid.pl/misc/2011-12-07-005909_285x370_scrot.png holy crap, i can't believe it
2011-12-06T18:59:34  <AntDroid> Fluxid: i'm wanting to limit the defense to 2 layers of ants. right now they just all piled up defending layer over layer
2011-12-06T18:59:37  <Fluxid> maybe i'll just stop tsting with old version and just use main tcp server
2011-12-06T19:00:23  <Fluxid> 2 layers? good, i'll be able to make advantage if this tomorrow (it sits on my TODO list for a while) ;)

2011-12-06T19:07:33  <jab_bott> this is so annoying - I was using a 196x196 map in the cell maze range (p04_01) and it's disappeared and there's no 196x196 map to replace it
2011-12-06T19:10:02  <jab_bott> if a map is not up to spec, why not just regenerate a new one over the top but with the same name and size and whatever other parameters may be deemed important?
2011-12-06T19:10:06  <Antimony> That's because 196x196 is too big
2011-12-06T19:10:12  <Antimony> the max size was lowered
2011-12-06T19:10:32  <jab_bott> oh, I thought it was 200x200 - that's why I was looking for a nice big map to test on
2011-12-06T19:10:53  <Antimony> the maximum area is now 25000
2011-12-06T19:11:34  <Antimony> So you can have 200x125 or 158x158
2011-12-06T19:13:47  <jab_bott> which is the biggest map now?
2011-12-06T19:15:49  <bugnuts> is cell_maze_p08_04 still valid? if so I think thats it
2011-12-06T19:17:25  <McLeopold> jab_bott: you can generate your own large maps if you want

2011-12-06T19:32:32  <jab_bott> McLeopold: really? I'm sure I've seen multiple hills per player on games on the server
2011-12-06T19:32:35  <janzert> maybe 500
2011-12-06T19:33:01  <McLeopold> jab_bott: you don't get to specify bots for hills, the multi-hills are already set for the number of players
2011-12-06T19:33:29  <jab_bott> McLeopold: ahh - so it's a special map setting, like a 4p map but with 8 hills?
2011-12-06T19:33:43  <McLeopold> yeah, or some maps have 2 hills per player
2011-12-06T19:33:47  <McLeopold> it depends on the map
2011-12-06T19:34:10  <McLeopold> janzert: at 500, any maps with 900 area per player are garrenteed to have 1 hill
2011-12-06T19:34:16  <jab_bott> I see, ta
2011-12-06T19:34:28  <janzert> yes
2011-12-06T19:35:03  <McLeopold> what's the density of my exampmle map...
2011-12-06T19:35:18  <janzert> 304 :)
2011-12-06T19:35:25  <janzert> so 300 is probably too low
2011-12-06T19:35:31  <janzert> just was figuring it out
2011-12-06T19:36:03  <McLeopold> 304
2011-12-06T19:36:11  <janzert> :)
2011-12-06T19:36:22  <McLeopold> yeah, 500 sounds good
2011-12-06T19:36:40  <McLeopold> that give an upper bound of 10 hills per player :)
2011-12-06T19:37:05  <janzert> that's more than I want to see anyway I think ;)
2011-12-06T19:37:29  <janzert> I wouldn't mind an upper bound of ~5 but not real strong on that
2011-12-06T19:37:32  <McLeopold> the probability that I generate another hill is 50%
2011-12-06T19:37:41  <McLeopold> so, it's like flipping 10 heads

2011-12-06T19:45:44  <jab_bott> um, I think it's a converging geometric progression - I forget all that maths stuff!

2011-12-06T19:58:31  <McLeopold> or, take that set of players and run games until sigma drops

2011-12-06T20:01:21  <McLeopold> janzert: also, for finals, I thought the best method would be to lock submissions, then "resubmit" every users final bot as a "final submission"
2011-12-06T20:01:38  <McLeopold> it automatically resets all sigma/mu values for everyone, without messing with the database
2011-12-06T20:01:40  <janzert> one of the limits on how far the cutoff can be taken is so it doesn't effect the opponents the top bots are playing
2011-12-06T20:01:52  <Garf> in that case, being the first one submitted should be an advantage
2011-12-06T20:01:57  <Garf> you'll get more matches, so lower sigma
2011-12-06T20:02:42  <janzert> garf they are are essentially all submitted at the same time

2011-12-06T20:02:57  <Garf> ok
2011-12-06T20:03:07  <janzert> McLeopold: doesn't really matter to me, the skill reset is already implemented and tested though
2011-12-06T20:03:10  <Garf> still, what advantage has a final ranking based on skill instead of mu?
2011-12-06T20:03:33  <janzert> if you don't count sigma you basically lose your variance measure
2011-12-06T20:03:43  <Garf> and that matters how?
2011-12-06T20:03:48  <Garf> the winner should be the strongest bot
2011-12-06T20:03:54  <janzert> tells you how consistently good the bot is
2011-12-06T20:03:58  <Garf> which is only defined by mu
2011-12-06T20:04:11  <janzert> but may be bad more often
2011-12-06T20:04:15  <Garf> no
2011-12-06T20:04:22  <a1k0n> not really.  if the top two bots are 0.1 mu different but both have sigma=2, then it's pretty hard to tell who's actually better
2011-12-06T20:04:25  <Garf> on average it must be better
2011-12-06T20:04:34  <McLeopold> Garf: http://pastebin.com/EwKG2ptb
2011-12-06T20:04:53  <Garf> a1k0n: that's true, but the one with biggest mu still has the highest likelihood

2011-12-06T20:05:14  <Garf> McLeopold: your point is that all sigma are very close?
2011-12-06T20:05:17  <McLeopold> we will obviously run enough games so it is not a factor
2011-12-06T20:05:21  <a1k0n> yes, but they could switch places with a game or two
2011-12-06T20:05:34  <McLeopold> no, my point is that sigma and game_count are not correlated

2011-12-06T20:05:41  <McLeopold> sigma is ordered, game count varies
2011-12-06T20:05:59  <a1k0n> well, they're definitely correlated towards game_count < 10
2011-12-06T20:06:02  <Garf> uh, if they're not correlated, you have a HUGE bug
2011-12-06T20:06:12  <a1k0n> it's just noisy
2011-12-06T20:06:16  <Garf> right
2011-12-06T20:07:09  <McLeopold> Garf: I don't think you understand trueskill
2011-12-06T20:07:15  <Garf> there is no sound reason to declar highest skill = winner. For example, the sigma*x factor (which is 3 IIRC) is very arbitrary there
2011-12-06T20:07:32  <Garf> I understand it defines strenght as a mean and a variance
2011-12-06T20:07:51  <Garf> variance decreases with more information and increases with unexpected results
2011-12-06T20:08:48  <Garf> You're proposing to order based on confidence margins. I'm pointing out that regardless of confidence margins, the highest mean (of the sampled matches) is most likely to have the highest mean (for an infinite amount of games).

2011-12-06T20:09:54  <Garf> This is a human psychology consideration, not statistics.
2011-12-06T20:10:15  <McLeopold> TrueSkill provides 2 values, using mu-sigma*3 provides conservitive rankings
2011-12-06T20:10:34  <McLeopold> I agree that mu, without sigma, should declare the winner
2011-12-06T20:10:42  <McLeopold> we need to convince janzert
2011-12-06T20:10:48  <Garf> ok, good :P
2011-12-06T20:11:05  <McLeopold> I'l also like to prove somehow that the "winners" skill range is well above the others
2011-12-06T20:11:23  <McLeopold> so, the winner must have the highest max skill as well
2011-12-06T20:11:38  <Garf> That depends on the submissions.

2011-12-06T20:12:44  <Garf> (I think you can apply the same criticism to that as I just did for skill vs mu)
2011-12-06T20:13:06  <McLeopold> but if there isn't 1 person with both the high mu and high mu+sigma*3, I don't think we can pick 1 person
2011-12-06T20:13:41  <Garf> ideally, all sigmas are very close
2011-12-06T20:13:56  <a1k0n> you can compute likelihood of dominance
2011-12-06T20:14:13  <janzert> ranking for the whole contest has been based on skill, I really don't want to change the for the finals
2011-12-06T20:14:35  <Garf> the finals are different because the bots don't change any more
2011-12-06T20:14:46  <a1k0n> bots don't change now

2011-12-06T20:15:51  <McLeopold> we only use conservitive so that you naturally climb the ranks rather than bounce around
2011-12-06T20:16:08  <Garf> exactly
2011-12-06T20:16:20  <McLeopold> brb
2011-12-06T20:16:22  <janzert> that's not the primary reason to use a conservative skill
2011-12-06T20:16:43  <janzert> I don't really care at all if new entries bounced around
2011-12-06T20:16:52  <Garf> conservative is used because otherwhise, for example in Halo, you could get lucky in the first few games, get a high mu, and then be effectively be discouraged from playing more, because its likely to drop your skill
2011-12-06T20:17:06  <bugnuts> If anyone is interested I put all the new hill data in a google fusion table https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=2359966
2011-12-06T20:17:19  <Garf> the conservative formula ensures that your skill slowly grows upwards
2011-12-06T20:17:37  <Garf> and you don't "accidentally" get ranked too high
2011-12-06T20:17:37  <janzert> it also says, we're pretty confident you're at least this good
2011-12-06T20:17:39  <_flag> How come elo seemed to be so definitive and trueskill varies so much? Is it just because of the volitility of the game itself?
2011-12-06T20:17:53  <Garf> this isn't a relevant consideration if we're at the point the matches are automatic and the bots don't change
2011-12-06T20:17:57  <janzert> elo gives a false pretense of confidence :)
2011-12-06T20:18:05  <janzert> at least the way displayed
2011-12-06T20:18:07  <a1k0n> yeah, elo internally had mu and variance
2011-12-06T20:18:13  <Garf> if you'd only look at mu, elo would be very similar
2011-12-06T20:18:54  <McLeopold> with elo, you effectively choose your own sigma for each match, based on the match type
2011-12-06T20:19:00  <McLeopold> aka, the K value
2011-12-06T20:19:19  <McLeopold> glicko is better, but still only does 2 players
2011-12-06T20:19:39  <Garf> glicko for 2 players is extremely similar to trueskill
2011-12-06T20:19:55  <Garf> you can use glicko for multiplayer games btw, but I think the statistical foundation is weaker
2011-12-06T20:20:08  <a1k0n> well tron was using bayeselo by the end
2011-12-06T20:20:10  <Garf> because you must assume strength adds linearly (in the log domain that ELO operates in)
2011-12-06T20:20:39  <a1k0n> trueskill makes the same assumption
2011-12-06T20:21:33  <Garf> I admit not knowing where the fine differences lie then

2011-12-06T22:18:37  <matthewd> For finals cutoff, don't you just deactivate everyone with mu+sigma*3 < mu_top-sigma_top*3, then continue running games for the remainder *drawing opponents from the full pool* until sigma drops?
2011-12-06T22:19:42  <McLeopold> I like that
2011-12-06T22:21:58  <antimatroid> what does that do?
2011-12-06T22:22:04  * antimatroid likes that everyone is reset to the same thing
2011-12-06T22:22:17  <antimatroid> i would be quite opposed to doing anything that didn't have everyone starting exactly the same
2011-12-06T22:22:30  <McLeopold> well, it would naturally limit the active players, without us picking an arbitrary number
2011-12-06T22:22:40  <antimatroid> McLeopold: we need to change "rank stabilised", that's not correct
2011-12-06T22:22:46  <McLeopold> oh, assume we reset everyone at once
2011-12-06T22:22:54  <antimatroid> it's more like "no participating bot can increase in ranking"
2011-12-06T22:22:59  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm not going to change it
2011-12-06T22:23:00  <matthewd> antimatroid: It avoids janzert's concern that a straight cut-off would drastically alter the set of opponents
2011-12-06T22:23:14  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it's not right though
2011-12-06T22:23:15  <McLeopold> right, cause you can still draw from the full set
2011-12-06T22:23:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it's word smithing, too late for that
2011-12-06T22:23:45  <matthewd> Though presumably the match-making will mean that by that time, those bots are going to be pretty much only playing each other anyway.
2011-12-06T22:24:30  <McLeopold> the matching making still picks a random number for the rank distance
2011-12-06T22:24:47  <McLeopold> rank in match quality, not mu or skill
2011-12-06T22:28:53  <antimatroid> i don't get this mu thing? players end up equally ranked right?
2011-12-06T22:29:27  <BenJackson> mu-3sigma is a number you're almost certainly better than
2011-12-06T22:29:33  <BenJackson> mu+3sigma is a number you're almost certainly less than
2011-12-06T22:29:54  <BenJackson> so using those as the cutoffs means you keep any bot that is remotely possible of being as good at its best as the best are at their worst
2011-12-06T22:36:19  <antimatroid> but aren't you still starting bots with different rankings?
2011-12-06T22:51:27  <McLeopold> @later tell jab_bott the latest visualizer broke a previous reply and doesn't show lines :(

2011-12-06T23:53:52  <ademar> yeap .. something weird is happening on my profile as well ..
2011-12-06T23:54:49  <amstan> ademar: related to c#?
2011-12-06T23:55:11  <ademar> yes my bot is C# as well
2011-12-06T23:55:18  <janzert> amstan: I would guess it's related to "added optimization to C# as per request" suppose the author of that should be able to fix it ;)
2011-12-06T23:55:28  <amstan> ademar: do you have linux?
2011-12-06T23:55:37  <ademar> yes i do

2011-12-06T23:56:11  <amstan> apparently --optimize=all is not it
2011-12-06T23:56:12  <ademar> lemme look it up .. never used then before
