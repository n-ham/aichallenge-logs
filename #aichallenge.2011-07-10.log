2011-07-10T09:42:40  <bhasker> :)
2011-07-10T09:42:49  <bhasker> aren't you using an svn repository?
2011-07-10T09:42:54  <bhasker> or some kind of src control
2011-07-10T09:43:18  <mleise> no, and especially not for my system files. that's just odd :p
2011-07-10T09:43:49  <bhasker> ah:p
2011-07-10T09:44:46  <bhasker> well windows restore:)
2011-07-10T09:44:53  <bhasker> enable windows system restore
2011-07-10T09:45:04  <bhasker> thats pretty much a src control system :)
2011-07-10T09:45:12  <bhasker> if you are on windows i.e
2011-07-10T09:45:32  <bhasker> i think even ext4 on linux has a journalling file system which you can probably use to roll back stuff
2011-07-10T09:45:39  <bhasker> or use ZFS on freebsd
2011-07-10T09:45:49  <bhasker> or ... use BTRFS on linux
2011-07-10T09:45:59  <bhasker> i think even that supports complete versioning of files
2011-07-10T09:46:01  <mleise> bhasker: Oo not so much information
2011-07-10T09:46:18  <bhasker> :)
2011-07-10T09:46:26  <mleise> BeTteR FileSystem?
2011-07-10T09:46:28  <bhasker> ZFS is an awesome filesystem
2011-07-10T09:46:42  <bhasker> yup
2011-07-10T09:46:43  <bhasker> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs
2011-07-10T09:47:07  <mcstar> mleise: i dont get your first comment
2011-07-10T09:47:19  <mcstar> why is it causing problems?
2011-07-10T09:47:44  <bhasker> i am guessing he didn't give the complete list of statements
2011-07-10T09:47:52  <bhasker> he probably modifies x between cp and mv
2011-07-10T09:48:00  <bhasker> i am guessing
2011-07-10T09:48:11  <mleise> no, that was all
2011-07-10T09:48:27  <mcstar> so? i dont see a problem with that
2011-07-10T09:48:42  <mcstar> what am i missing?
2011-07-10T09:48:44  <mleise> It didn't keep symlinks and maybe some permissions. i couldn't use my desktop or mysql any longer :p
2011-07-10T09:49:30  <mcstar> you must have been root, so permissions would be inherited, right?
2011-07-10T09:49:38  <mleise> especially gconf ran amok. it reset every setting to default that was involved at that time
2011-07-10T09:50:09  <mcstar> mleise: is x and y a directory?
2011-07-10T09:50:15  <mleise> i was root, but trust me, that I did nothing more than copy and move back
2011-07-10T09:50:22  <mleise> no x and y are files
2011-07-10T09:50:26  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-10T09:50:32  <mleise> should have used cp -a
2011-07-10T09:50:45  <mcstar> can it be some missing .conf files?
2011-07-10T09:51:53  <mleise> I don't know and I don't care any more. At least it gave me the opportunity to look thoroughly through my logs and I found some other minor configuration flaws, like no dri2 module loaded for my nvidia driver, or no 'keychain' application installed
2011-07-10T09:52:19  <mcstar> isnt dri2 loaded automatically?
2011-07-10T09:52:37  <mcstar> mleise: sorry for being such a smart-ass
2011-07-10T09:53:21  <mleise> mcstar: It would be, but people on the net spread the word that it isn't required
2011-07-10T09:54:06  <mcstar> im going back to popping sour cherry and watching predator*
2011-07-10T09:54:11  <mleise> mcstar: And in fact now that I gave xorg the ModulePath to the lib it loaded dri2, but nvidia unloaded and reloaded it to do some initialization stuff on it
2011-07-10T09:54:55  <mleise> mcstar: have fun, I watched that movie when I was young and it was midnight, my parents were at the neighbours house
2011-07-10T09:55:03  <mcstar> i dont mess around with xorg since it isnt a mandatory config file
2011-07-10T09:55:09  <mleise> man it was the most awesome movie at that time *g*
2011-07-10T09:55:17  <mcstar> it is good :)
2011-07-10T09:55:18  <bhasker> mleise :) i am just suggesting that having a better filesystem is helpful in such matters anyway
2011-07-10T09:55:26  <mcstar> but i have similar experience with aliens
2011-07-10T09:55:27  <bhasker> like snapshots are cheap
2011-07-10T09:55:34  <mleise> btr fs, in deed
2011-07-10T09:55:37  <bhasker> on certain filesystems
2011-07-10T09:55:55  <bhasker> so modifying system files you take a snapshot/modify/snapshot restore if needed
2011-07-10T09:56:31  <bhasker> zfs is a pretty awesome filesystem, i wish it was the default and supported across more oses
2011-07-10T09:56:51  <bhasker> dynamic pooling of partitions/disks/volumes is a pretty awesome feature
2011-07-10T09:56:54  <mleise> zfs seems to have a strict license
2011-07-10T09:56:57  <bhasker> yea
2011-07-10T09:57:06  <bhasker> thats why linux developed btrfs
2011-07-10T09:57:11  <bhasker> which is basically zfs pretty much
2011-07-10T09:57:19  <bhasker> zfs is supported on bsd though
2011-07-10T09:57:32  <bhasker> and i have used it, it takes some tuning to get it do its work but it works beautifully
2011-07-10T09:57:32  <mleise> bhasker: Oracle is developing it :p
2011-07-10T09:57:35  <bhasker> no fscks ever
2011-07-10T09:57:37  <mcstar> (i believe that lvm supports snapshots)
2011-07-10T09:57:41  <mleise> Oracle bought Sun
2011-07-10T09:57:46  <mleise> Sun developed ZFS
2011-07-10T09:57:49  <bhasker> yup
2011-07-10T09:57:52  <mleise> see the connection? ;)
2011-07-10T09:57:52  <bhasker> its part of Solaris
2011-07-10T09:58:01  <bhasker> its the default filesystem in solaris
2011-07-10T09:58:15  <bhasker> beauty of zfs is its always consistent on disk
2011-07-10T09:58:27  <bhasker> so a crash recovery is instant
2011-07-10T09:58:38  <mleise> I wonder if this time they manage to deliver a defrag tool and transparent compression
2011-07-10T09:58:48  <bhasker> instead of crappy ext3/ufs where with large disks you can be sitting forever for fsck to complete
2011-07-10T09:59:12  <mleise> bhasker: ok, ext4 fscheck doesn't take long to be fair
2011-07-10T09:59:15  <bhasker> which matters in production:) not fun when your db goes down and the box is doing fsck for 20 minutes
2011-07-10T09:59:23  <bhasker> well ext4 is journalling file system
2011-07-10T09:59:30  <bhasker> so its recovery is faster
2011-07-10T09:59:47  <mleise> ext3 is journaling too, i dont get the point :p
2011-07-10T09:59:52  <bhasker> i haven't looked at it closely but from what i understand it also tries to maintain disk state in a consistent manner
2011-07-10T10:00:03  <bhasker> well ext3 state is not always consistent
2011-07-10T10:00:10  <bhasker> some state is in kernel buffers etc at times
2011-07-10T10:00:15  <bhasker> not always written to disk
2011-07-10T10:00:19  <bhasker> so if box crashes
2011-07-10T10:00:25  <bhasker> file system state maybe inconsistent
2011-07-10T10:00:37  <bhasker> which is why the need to do an fsck after a crash
2011-07-10T10:00:52  <bhasker> zfs guarantees on disk data structures to be always consistent
2011-07-10T10:01:16  <bhasker> and adds journalling on top

2011-07-10T10:01:28  <bhasker> so in case of crashes, the box comes up , run journal entries
2011-07-10T10:01:32  <bhasker> and you are ready to go
2011-07-10T10:01:38  <bhasker> pretty much
2011-07-10T10:01:55  <mleise> with ext4 you have the option to use in kernel barriers to go sure the disk writes the data in the correct order, flushing internal caches if necessary

2011-07-10T11:31:07  <jmcarthur> what exactly is the "player seed"?

2011-07-10T11:36:51  <smiley1983> player seed is a random seed given to the player, different from the engine seed
2011-07-10T11:37:13  <smiley1983> previously the player was handed the random seed used by the engine for food generation :)
2011-07-10T11:37:56  <jmcarthur> haha
2011-07-10T11:38:21  <jmcarthur> i don't remember seeing the player seed in the spec
2011-07-10T11:38:25  <jmcarthur> is it new?
2011-07-10T11:38:58  <GreenTea> "<jmcarthur> i guess just nobody has gotten around to them yet" why? this is not important issues?
2011-07-10T11:39:31  <jmcarthur> GreenTea: probably different reasons depending on who you are talking about
2011-07-10T11:39:50  <jmcarthur> some people don't have the expertise, others don't have the time, etc...
2011-07-10T11:41:02  <jmcarthur> smiley1983: yeah the seed isn't even in the game spec on the github wiki :\
2011-07-10T11:41:58  <jmcarthur> it appears that it's already in the engine and stuff (i haven't actually checked the bot input though)...
2011-07-10T11:42:02  <GreenTea> If so, why not to write status in the issue description: "i dont have time, i don't know how to do this.." etc?
2011-07-10T11:42:15  <jmcarthur> GreenTea: are the issues assigned to specific people?
2011-07-10T11:43:27  <jmcarthur> doesn't look like it
2011-07-10T11:43:35  <jmcarthur> that's why nobody has to make excuses here
2011-07-10T11:43:53  <jmcarthur> if you want things to speed up, maybe you could work on them
2011-07-10T11:44:10  <smiley1983> Finding a stable trueskill implementation and making it do what is required seems to be the largest stumbling block
2011-07-10T11:44:11  <GreenTea> 2 issues are assigned. 3 - not assigned
2011-07-10T11:44:18  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-07-10T11:45:59  <GreenTea> "Finding a stable trueskill implementation and making it do what is required seems to be the largest stumbling block" it is so importand for launch?
2011-07-10T11:46:25  <GreenTea> current implementation is work. we can see it on beta server
2011-07-10T11:46:49  <GreenTea> maybe with some bugs, but anyway..
2011-07-10T11:47:07  <smiley1983> currently it crashes sometimes, meaning some games are not ranked
2011-07-10T11:47:27  <smiley1983> then people complain about every individual game where they did not receive their skill points
2011-07-10T11:47:43  <GreenTea> and what? in first month or too, it is not so important..
2011-07-10T11:48:07  <GreenTea> it will became really important on finals only
2011-07-10T11:48:36  <smiley1983> you are right, they could probably proceed at this point
2011-07-10T11:48:44  <smiley1983> for whatever reason, they've decided to wait

2011-07-10T13:24:55  <eashoka> mcstar: thanks
2011-07-10T13:26:10  <eashoka> spotted another problem. classes in the java standard stater package and in the tools (sample boths there) are different
2011-07-10T13:27:25  <eashoka> ilk class for instance has very few enum types (no UNSEEN for instance) in the starter package so the meaning of isPasable() etc are very different
2011-07-10T13:28:59  <eashoka> which is the correct version to use ? In the case of simpler version, how would one determine whether a given tile is a unseen one or not ? anyone who has used the java package ?

2011-07-10T14:02:58  <jmcarthur> lol, use at least python 2.7... i have to tweak all these scripts to use python2 because arch uses python 3 as the default python command
2011-07-10T14:04:43  <mcstar> i symlinked python2 to /usr/bin/python
2011-07-10T14:05:07  <jmcarthur> i'd do that except that other packages are used to seeing python 3 at that path

2011-07-10T14:08:13  <jmcarthur> my new haskell starter is almost ready, woo!
2011-07-10T14:08:13  <sir_macelon> eashoka: sample bots just use different code
2011-07-10T14:08:24  <jmcarthur> but it can't be official because i'm using unsupported things
2011-07-10T14:08:45  <mcstar> such as?
2011-07-10T14:08:56  <jmcarthur> it relies on being able to exec a binary on the server
2011-07-10T14:08:58  <eashoka> sir_macelon : so I should use the api in starter package to upload , not the ones in sample code ?
2011-07-10T14:09:06  <jmcarthur> because it uses libraries not on the server
2011-07-10T14:09:20  <jmcarthur> and it's designed so that you can use whatever compiler version you want (i want to use ghc 7)
2011-07-10T14:09:26  <mcstar> jmcarthur: yeah, that probably shouldnt be in a starter bot :)
2011-07-10T14:09:45  <mcstar> (i mean the execing binaries part)
2011-07-10T14:10:06  <sir_macelon> eashoka: yes, the sample code is not in good quality
2011-07-10T14:10:16  <jmcarthur> it's a fine starter. just not something we would want to officially support
2011-07-10T14:10:34  <eashoka> sir_macelon : problem is, starter package ILK class seems not complete when compared to the sample coee ILK
2011-07-10T14:10:42  <jmcarthur> also, because of this assumption, you have to build it on a 64 bit machine
2011-07-10T14:10:54  <jmcarthur> in fact, i guess it has to be 64 bit linux, specifically
2011-07-10T14:11:10  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I removed unnecessary information, so that beginners won't get confused to much
2011-07-10T14:11:48  <eashoka> sir_macelon : no UNSEEN type in the enum in the starter package. I just spotted after trying to figure out why my isPassable() method doesn't work. :-)
2011-07-10T14:12:17  <eashoka> sir_macelon : with the current starter package api, how do u determine a tile is a unseen one or not ?

2011-07-10T14:13:10  <sir_macelon> eashoka: anyway starter package didn't offer a functionality to detect unseen tiles
2011-07-10T14:13:33  <sir_macelon> eashoka: you have to take care by your own, it's a taks for a programmer
2011-07-10T14:14:12  <sir_macelon> eashoka: but basically you just check if the tile is in view radius of any of your ants
2011-07-10T14:15:25  <sir_macelon> eashoka: so this UNSEEN was just there without any purpose or background implementation, you can check it in the sample bots, they don't use it at all
2011-07-10T14:16:20  <sir_macelon> eashoka: yes, it is compared in the isPassable() method, but it is not set anywhere in the code
2011-07-10T14:16:24  <eashoka> sir_macelon : ah ok.  thanks. so when the server gives you an ants object, it's 2d map for tiles can have unseen tiles with different status (and a wrong one) marked on ?
2011-07-10T14:16:46  <jmcarthur> that reminds me... this view radius check... is a square visible if *any* part of it is in range, if the *center* is in range, or the *entire* square is in range?
2011-07-10T14:16:56  <jmcarthur> same for food and attack ranges
2011-07-10T14:17:48  <sir_macelon> eashoka: no, server does not send you any objects, just strings, you create the objects in your code
2011-07-10T14:17:56  <jmcarthur> actually maybe that's in the spec and i just missed it
2011-07-10T14:18:14  <jmcarthur> but if not and somebody clarifies for me then i'll go ahead and add it
2011-07-10T14:18:51  <jmcarthur> nevermind
2011-07-10T14:18:53  <jmcarthur> the spec is quite clear
2011-07-10T14:19:03  <jmcarthur> sorry for the noise
2011-07-10T14:20:51  <eashoka> sir_macelon : I meant this : "public void do_turn(Ants ants) {"  ok, in the string the server sends, how would it mark the unseen tiles ? I mean the server is supposed to give you info only for the tiles you can see right ? so what would be the default enum for a unseen tile ? LAND ?
2011-07-10T14:21:15  <mcstar> jmcarthur: if you visualize it, its best to put a squares center into the origo
2011-07-10T14:21:27  <jmcarthur> eashoka: the spec for starters is that unseen squares are assumed to be land until they have been seen
2011-07-10T14:21:31  <mcstar> so the integer coordinates are centers as well
2011-07-10T14:21:40  <jmcarthur> eashoka: i disagree with the wisdom of that choice, but there it is
2011-07-10T14:21:44  <mcstar> but of course it doesnt matter

2011-07-10T14:29:45  <sir_macelon> eashoka: you would have to do it by your own and share with us :)
2011-07-10T14:30:13  <eashoka> sir_macelon : will try :-)
2011-07-10T14:30:14  <sir_macelon> currently pythoners are favoured only
2011-07-10T14:30:44  <amstan> jython anyone?
2011-07-10T14:30:50  <amstan> then you can link the code and stuff
2011-07-10T14:31:06  <amstan> if you wanna make a java gui for example
2011-07-10T14:31:15  <sir_macelon> eashoka: your bot is not that bad at all, made it into top 20
2011-07-10T14:31:18  <eashoka> sir_macelon : I almost like python, except for the white space thingy.....
2011-07-10T14:32:21  <sir_macelon> amstan: but it's rather a matter of changing the code, so that it won't be killing the bots after timeout while debugging, than just running it in java
2011-07-10T14:32:28  <eashoka> sir_macelon : it once came to 10th as well, then dropped sudednly after i added that cool feature. Tx anyway, but it's no where near ur one. I'm full of owe on how slyly you hunt ither ants relentlessly
2011-07-10T14:33:21  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I haven't tried python, I prefer to stick to my main language
2011-07-10T14:33:48  *** gobang <gobang!~gobang@82.113.99.161> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-07-10T14:34:03  <sir_macelon> eashoka: thanks, but I still see room for improvement :)
2011-07-10T14:34:25  <eashoka> sir_macelon : same here. as for the bots, I put some extra code specifially avoid getting eaten by ur hunter ants, but for no awail. manged to run away for a while though but they eventually getting me. very cool bot indeed!
2011-07-10T14:35:19  <jmcarthur> better would be to go on the offensive
2011-07-10T14:35:30  <jmcarthur> so long as you can figure out a nice battle strategy
2011-07-10T14:35:45  <jmcarthur> i suspect that a little game tree search would do nicely for that
2011-07-10T14:36:03  <eashoka> sir_macelon : ur bot has made the contest really interesting and very challenging, taking it to a different levle where others are forced to react.
2011-07-10T14:36:17  <sir_macelon> eashoka: thanks, the offensive module is most advanced in my bot, still I struggle with exploration and food collection subtelities
2011-07-10T14:36:28  <eashoka> jmcarthur : yeah I was thinking that too. no use running for sir_macelon all the time :-)
2011-07-10T14:36:40  <jmcarthur> being offensive gives you map control :)
2011-07-10T14:38:23  <eashoka> jmcarthur : but in a game of say 10 players, be offensive and getting killed while others are peacefully collecting food is bit risky, this is the part i'm trying to balance out :-)
2011-07-10T14:39:04  <eashoka> may be for a initial little period, one need to gather and then go hunting.
2011-07-10T14:39:35  <jmcarthur> i haven't explored the game deeply enough yet, but i suspect you might be wrong
2011-07-10T14:39:49  <eashoka> of course that doesn't apply to sir_macelon. his ants seem more safe when they are attacking! they hardly get killed
2011-07-10T14:39:59  <jmcarthur> if you can keep enemies away from a patch of land then you can monopolize the food in that area
2011-07-10T14:40:10  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-07-10T14:40:21  <jmcarthur> you have to actually be able to do you offense well, not just throw ants at the problem
2011-07-10T14:40:30  <jmcarthur> the mythical ant month? :P
2011-07-10T14:40:45  <jmcarthur> *your offense
2011-07-10T14:41:34  <sir_macelon> eashoka: if you attack 2v1 you will be safe :)
2011-07-10T14:45:22  <eashoka> sir_macelone : yeah.. I'm getting a little offensive module going, my one was designed more like a gatherer from the beginning, so bit hard with that design to get individual ants to grouyp together etc. that's the part u r doing beautifully. it's a treat to watch how ur 2-3 pairs going after prey :-)
2011-07-10T14:46:32  <jmcarthur> is anybody trying to guess things they can't see, yet?
2011-07-10T14:47:19  <sir_macelon> i guess it's to early for that as map symmetries are not settled yet
2011-07-10T14:48:58  <jmcarthur> i also mean things like enemy ants and such
2011-07-10T14:49:40  <jmcarthur> like if you already have seen the area, know where water is, and know where some enemy ants were previously, where might they be now
2011-07-10T14:50:05  <antimatroid> i'm tracking food out of sight, i'm planning to do enemy ant info but haven't done that yet
2011-07-10T14:50:24  <antimatroid> i'm undecided on whether i want to go all out with markov chains or just expand out where an enemy ant could possibly be
2011-07-10T14:50:32  <jmcarthur> tracking as in guessing or tracking as in "i saw it here before, maybe it will still be here when i get back"?
2011-07-10T14:51:34  <antimatroid> say a location was viewable last turn as an enemy ant and i can't match that up to a visible enemy now, i'd mark that and adjacent non-visible squares as possibly containing an ant, then each turn i'd push that information outwards in the non-visible parts of my map
2011-07-10T14:51:49  <antimatroid> you could use actual probabilities with markov chains if you thought you could make use of the information
2011-07-10T14:52:41  <antimatroid> you could alternatively track how long ago the information of an ant that could reach the square was seen
2011-07-10T14:53:57  <jmcarthur> yeah i've been thinking about this stuff too
2011-07-10T14:54:07  <jmcarthur> probabilities are tougher than they sound
2011-07-10T14:54:20  <antimatroid> nah, markov chains :)
2011-07-10T14:54:21  <jmcarthur> because you also have to consider this isn't just a random ant. it might be smart
2011-07-10T14:54:29  <antimatroid> oh yeah, i'd assume just randomness
2011-07-10T14:54:42  <jmcarthur> then i'd say your probabilities are misleading at best
2011-07-10T14:54:48  <antimatroid> yeah true
2011-07-10T14:55:20  <antimatroid> i will probably just go with something like tracking both possible ant information and the most recently seen ant that could have made it there
2011-07-10T14:55:23  <jmcarthur> the propogation method is the easiest one
2011-07-10T14:55:33  <antimatroid> i'm also keen to play around with "avoiding enemies" while path finding
2011-07-10T14:55:35  <jmcarthur> well, i think, at least
2011-07-10T14:55:46  <jmcarthur> i'm more interested in seeking them out ;)
2011-07-10T14:56:09  <antimatroid> i want to do both, navigate around them in some instances, hunt them down in others :)
2011-07-10T14:57:36  <eashoka> avoiding enemies is clearly disadvantageous when you are gathering food. you can die together with a competing enemy for the resource so that ur second ant may get to the food. wheras if u try to avoid the enemy, he will just walk away with the food.
2011-07-10T14:58:50  <sir_macelon> eashoke: you've just revealed a bot feature publicly :)
2011-07-10T14:59:07  <sir_macelon> eashoka: you've just revealed a bot feature publicly :)
2011-07-10T14:59:38  *** choas <choas!~lars@p5792C590.dip.t-dialin.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-10T14:59:50  <eashoka> my bot seems to be happier when it encounters bots who try to avoid. (except for sir_macelon, he seems to avoid 1-1 clashes at all time only because he want to come at you with two!)
2011-07-10T15:00:03  <antimatroid> eashoka: i think there can be instances where the path you choose will determine whether you can collect a piece of food or whether an enemy could potentially engage you in a battle before reaching the food
2011-07-10T15:00:14  <antimatroid> and there's a few other things i'd play around with
2011-07-10T15:00:35  <eashoka> sir_macelon : just voiced an observation when seeing games. :-)
2011-07-10T15:01:40  <sir_macelon> eashoka: some people would spent hours before discovering that, you've just helped them freely :)
2011-07-10T15:02:02  <antimatroid> sir_macelon: what's wrong with sharing strategy ideas? :P
2011-07-10T15:05:13  <sir_macelon> antimatroid: you're spoiling the possibility to discover them for other contestants :P
2011-07-10T15:06:56  <eashoka> sir_macelone : actually there is a good point there. you get so much satisfaction when you figure (ir thought u figured) something out by urself. taking that fun away from ppl would be very cruel to them :-)
2011-07-10T15:11:24  <eashoka> antimatroid : IMHO, I think markov chains might be an overkill. I would rather spend time on building formations trying to survive bit longer from sir_macelon  when I meet him in next version :-)
2011-07-10T15:12:00  <mcstar> honestly, i hope the games will get more intricate and interesting than theyre now
2011-07-10T15:14:39  <sir_macelon> mcstar: they should be, I am still awaiting competition :)
2011-07-10T15:14:49  <eashoka> BTW, the server is very slow these days, it take ages for you to come back up in the ranking for a new version. to make it worse, there are lot of good bots at skill level 70s. not easy getting through. there was a time I could get into first 20 in about 10 games, now it takes about 30. think that means competition is getting heated up.
2011-07-10T15:15:03  <mcstar> sir_macelon: after my snake is ready, you'll get my full attention :)
2011-07-10T15:15:53  <eashoka> sir_macelon :  I fear we will see dozen of bots which acts like your one in about few weeks time.
2011-07-10T15:16:56  <jmcarthur> mcstar: you're making a snake bot?
2011-07-10T15:17:18  <mcstar> jmcarthur: you want to discourage me too?
2011-07-10T15:17:23  <eashoka> sir_macelon : I bet lot of ppl trying to emulate your strategy (or how to avoid from it)  right now. hopefully this game has enough depth not to exhaust the interest in coming few months!
2011-07-10T15:17:56  <eashoka> msctar : rn't u supposed to build an ant bot ?
2011-07-10T15:18:21  <mcstar> eashoka: a snake from ants
2011-07-10T15:18:31  <mcstar> and try tab completion
2011-07-10T15:19:20  <mcstar> stocha had one, i need one too
2011-07-10T15:19:38  <eashoka> mcstar : yeah I think I have seen a similar one in action. ur snake better hit from sideways I suppose :-) one I saw tried to hit from the head.
2011-07-10T15:27:16  <antimatroid> no offense to people who have put effort into bots, but the ranking of my bot on there says to me there still isn't much competition
2011-07-10T15:28:14  <antimatroid> @topic
2011-07-10T15:28:14  <contestbot> antimatroid: Official Google AI Challenge: http://ai-contest.com/ || Channel Logs: http://contestbot.hypertriangle.com/ || Code Repo: http://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge || Beta testers needed: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/ (amstan) || Launch Preparation Meeting http://bit.ly/kYYbD4 (amstan)
2011-07-10T15:31:52  <mcstar> well, you had a jumpstart
2011-07-10T15:32:01  <mcstar> you could use the ready made c++ starter bot
2011-07-10T15:32:32  <antimatroid> i'm not denying i've had a huge advantage with time to think
2011-07-10T15:32:42  <antimatroid> but i'm also of the opinion that the bot isn't that smart
2011-07-10T15:33:22  <mcstar> (bah, it was a joke, sort of, since you wrote that bot too)
2011-07-10T15:33:24  <antimatroid> imo the largest/hardest part of this contest is the battles/interacting with enemies, that is afterall what makes it a game rather than a decision problem, and I haven't really addressed that at all
2011-07-10T15:34:44  <mcstar> but i think there are a couple of use, who started this contest wiht a language we didnt know before
2011-07-10T15:35:31  <antimatroid> yeah, i often forget how much easier it is for me to pick apart what i need to do now as opposed to when i first started
2011-07-10T15:35:59  <antimatroid> but my general point is i think there is a lot of room for improvement in strategies, and i suspect the games will get more interesting to watch when the bots get smarter
2011-07-10T15:36:10  <jmcarthur> i suppose it is probably not worth announcing my unofficial starter at this point
2011-07-10T15:36:43  <jmcarthur> now it's time for me to start playing with some ai ideas
2011-07-10T15:36:52  <mcstar> jmcarthur: not the right audience, is it? we all have our bots...
2011-07-10T15:36:59  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'd be keen to look at it sometime, but not right now, it's the middle of hte night :P
2011-07-10T15:37:02  <jmcarthur> well, also, it's pretty early
2011-07-10T15:37:14  <jmcarthur> still being in the beta and all
2011-07-10T15:37:37  <jmcarthur> i meant on the forum, not here
2011-07-10T15:37:49  <mcstar> ah
2011-07-10T15:37:54  <mcstar> sure, why not there?
2011-07-10T15:38:09  <jmcarthur> i just think it will get more attention if it's around when the contest actually starts
2011-07-10T15:38:20  <mcstar> you can up the post again
2011-07-10T15:38:29  <mcstar> or whatever they call it(i dont use forums)
2011-07-10T15:39:15  <jmcarthur> eh, the makefile also has some beta-specific stuff right now

2011-07-10T17:14:26  <bhasker> sir_macelon last contest there was a lot of sharing of ideas but the bots behaved quite differently
2011-07-10T17:14:37  <bhasker> knowing a strategy and implementing it are two very different things
2011-07-10T17:14:46  <jmcarthur> i, too, am not concerned with sharing of ideas
2011-07-10T17:14:57  <jmcarthur> so long as there isn't sharing of complete source code
2011-07-10T17:15:27  <jmcarthur> which has the effect of raising the bar for everybody

2011-07-10T17:16:03  <bhasker> yup
2011-07-10T17:16:18  <escortkeel> hey!
2011-07-10T17:16:30  <bhasker> some of the strategies in this game are pretty obvious
2011-07-10T17:16:38  <bhasker> and we will see most bots implement them pretty soon
2011-07-10T17:16:41  <sir_macelon> bhasker: so what strategies you have to share? :)
2011-07-10T17:16:42  <escortkeel> i agree
2011-07-10T17:16:47  <escortkeel> :)
2011-07-10T17:16:54  <mcstar> bhasker: i disagree
2011-07-10T17:16:56  <bhasker> i would share mine if my bot was doing better than 50:p
2011-07-10T17:17:08  <bhasker> i doubt you would be interested in mine:)
2011-07-10T17:17:11  <escortkeel> lol XD
2011-07-10T17:17:31  <bhasker> mine was doing well till i started improving it
2011-07-10T17:17:35  <bhasker> and now its getting worse!
2011-07-10T17:17:37  <mcstar> i dont really think these bots will implement anything on their own
2011-07-10T17:18:11  <bhasker> well last contest there was a genetic programming bot
2011-07-10T17:18:11  <bhasker> :)
2011-07-10T17:18:18  <bhasker> it did reasonably well
2011-07-10T17:18:22  <bhasker> after like 2000 generations
2011-07-10T17:18:24  <bhasker> or more
2011-07-10T17:18:37  <jmcarthur> it started a bit too late in the game to reach its full potential, i think
2011-07-10T17:18:41  <bhasker> yea
2011-07-10T17:18:49  <bhasker> but was quite interesting to watch its games
2011-07-10T17:18:58  <bhasker> though the php code they shared was hideous
2011-07-10T17:19:13  <jmcarthur> i have a very rough plan for my bot. this is probably the most vague idea i've had for a bot yet though
2011-07-10T17:19:16  <mcstar> i think you can do much better using your ideas then to let a GA find them out
2011-07-10T17:19:49  <bhasker> well how about this for a strategy, to get a food there are multiple optimal paths
2011-07-10T17:19:49  <mcstar> bhasker: initially i was going gor GA too
2011-07-10T17:19:59  <bhasker> in terms of length of path
2011-07-10T17:20:01  <mcstar> but soon gave up, cause we can do much better
2011-07-10T17:20:07  <jmcarthur> basically i'm going to have two distinct parts, one for micro and one for macro. essentially, the macro will give the micro some direction.
2011-07-10T17:20:10  <bhasker> but some may be worse than others based on enemies nearby
2011-07-10T17:20:18  <bhasker> so for every move evaluating mutliple paths
2011-07-10T17:20:21  <bhasker> would be advisable
2011-07-10T17:20:38  <bhasker> at the least there are almost always two optimal paths
2011-07-10T17:20:49  <bhasker> unless target is on the same row/col as your ant
2011-07-10T17:21:24  <bhasker> that can make the difference between getting the food before your enemy
2011-07-10T17:21:32  <bhasker> or dying in the act of getting it
2011-07-10T17:22:55  <mcstar> if i have enough time, ill write a bot that can teleport ants between locations
2011-07-10T17:23:01  <mcstar> that would be the ultimate bot
2011-07-10T17:24:13  <bhasker> there are more such generic strategies which can be shared, which are rather obvious
2011-07-10T17:24:18  <bhasker> if you observe the games close enough

2011-07-10T17:26:51  <sir_macelon> @later tell mcleopold something is broken in match making algo, I haven't been playing with any of the other top5 bots for a long time now...
2011-07-10T17:26:51  <contestbot> sir_macelon: Aye, aye, sir
2011-07-10T17:26:53  <mcstar> GreenTee was complaining about the same thing
2011-07-10T17:26:57  <bhasker> no one could come close to defeating his bot
2011-07-10T17:27:31  <bhasker> people were celebrating if their bot beat mega1's bot like 1 out of 100 times
2011-07-10T17:27:42  <sir_macelon> bhasker: I wish I had known about this contest earlier, it would have been exciting to face him
2011-07-10T17:28:08  <mcstar> sir_macelon: are you sure he wontbe around? :)
2011-07-10T17:28:30  <sir_macelon> mcstar: I don't know, but I am talking about pw contest
2011-07-10T17:28:31  <bhasker> you could still write a bot

2011-07-10T17:28:40  <bhasker> his bot is open sourced
2011-07-10T17:28:46  <bhasker> so you can still try and write one to beat it:)
2011-07-10T17:28:55  <bhasker> most of the top bots released their source
2011-07-10T17:28:58  <mcstar> sir_macelon: i know, thats why i said: maybe you get a chance now
2011-07-10T17:28:59  <sir_macelon> bhasker: that would be too easy now :)
2011-07-10T17:29:13  <bhasker> well don't look at his sourcep
2011-07-10T17:29:14  <bhasker> :)
2011-07-10T17:29:52  <sir_macelon> mcstar: but I don't know if he would bother now :)
2011-07-10T17:30:20  <sir_macelon> bhasker: well, I meant with unlimited time, I can't read lisp anyway :P
2011-07-10T17:30:55  <bhasker> well you could always set a target for yourself:)
2011-07-10T17:31:26  <bhasker> last contest was very interesting mainly because of the TCP server
2011-07-10T17:31:33  <bhasker> we really need to get a tcp server for ants
2011-07-10T17:31:37  <bhasker> that would really step up the game
2011-07-10T17:33:00  <sir_macelon> bhasker: well, maybe after the ants contests, I'll try, but it will never be the same :)
2011-07-10T17:33:12  <bhasker> that i agree
2011-07-10T17:33:25  <sir_macelon> bhasker: is the tcp server for pw still running?
2011-07-10T17:33:32  <bhasker> you can just start it up
2011-07-10T17:33:35  <bhasker> the code is available
2011-07-10T17:33:44  <bhasker> so you can just run the server and mega1s bot
2011-07-10T17:33:46  <bhasker> and your bot
2011-07-10T17:34:20  <bhasker> i think mcleopold had one running on his server for quite sometime after the contest
2011-07-10T17:34:22  <sir_macelon> well, for that I wouldn't need a servers, just local testing :)
2011-07-10T17:34:30  <ibdknox> I started writing a generic turn-based game server for stuff like this
2011-07-10T17:34:35  <bhasker> well the server can keep matchmaking and calculate elo etc
2011-07-10T17:34:55  <bhasker> so you don't have to write all that stuff up
2011-07-10T17:35:20  <ibdknox> TCP server that is
2011-07-10T17:35:45  <sir_macelon> ibknox: wow, when it will be ready?
2011-07-10T17:35:50  <jmcarthur> i did too, but i stopped when i realized i'd be moving soon and crap
2011-07-10T17:36:03  <mcstar> talking about crap...
2011-07-10T17:36:05  <ibdknox> sir_macelon: depends on how busy I end up :)

2011-07-10T17:36:40  <ibdknox> I was going to ask in here if there was a reason you take submissions directly instead of providing an interface, like over TCP
2011-07-10T17:36:51  <ibdknox> the only thing I could come up with is to standardize the hardware
2011-07-10T17:37:06  <ibdknox> since if someone ran their's on a cluster, they have a pretty obvious advantage lol
2011-07-10T17:37:26  <escortkeel> @later tell mcleopold how would i go about submitting an alternate java starter package?
2011-07-10T17:37:26  <contestbot> escortkeel: Yes master!
2011-07-10T17:38:31  <jmcarthur> ibdknox: exactly it
2011-07-10T17:38:44  <jmcarthur> same reason you aren't allowed to parallelize your bot
2011-07-10T17:38:51  <ibdknox> yeah
2011-07-10T17:39:05  <_flag> There was a buggy but functional tcp server that was set up awhile back, but it seems to have 404ed: https://github.com/berak/TCPServer

2011-07-10T17:39:18  <ibdknox> the sad part is that doing it over TCP you could run thousands of games at once
2011-07-10T17:39:58  <_flag> I still have some of the code on my computer though, so I'll try to see if I can set something up

2011-07-10T17:41:59  <sir_macelon> escortkeel: what would you change in the starter bot?

2011-07-10T17:43:01  <escortkeel> sir_macelon: i have made one which is object oriented, basically there are ant objects which have the ability to make their own descitions based on data from the Ants class
2011-07-10T17:44:11  <jmcarthur> why is it better this way?
2011-07-10T17:44:51  <sir_macelon> escortkeel: but do you know what are the rules for a starter package?
2011-07-10T17:45:13  <escortkeel> because it is easyer to make a bot which performs simeltaneous operations.... exploring, fighiting, foraging etc
2011-07-10T17:45:17  <mcstar> escortkeel: are your ant-classes persistent between turns?
2011-07-10T17:45:20  <escortkeel> and its easyer to debuy
2011-07-10T17:45:32  <escortkeel> no i dont knowe the rules for starter packs
2011-07-10T17:45:40  <jmcarthur> i am unconvinced
2011-07-10T17:45:54  <sir_macelon> escortkeel: you are free to modify it, because I've created it some time ago and now eventually came up with Ant classes also
2011-07-10T17:46:08  <_flag> Here's the TCP Server. I have no idea whether it works or not as it's not mine, I'm just reuploading it: https://github.com/flagcapper/Berak-s-TCP-Server
2011-07-10T17:46:19  <escortkeel> yes they are persitant... created when they are created i.e food and destroyed when killed
2011-07-10T17:46:53  <escortkeel> sir_macelon: thats awesome
