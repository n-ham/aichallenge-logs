2012-08-07T14:57:42  <mcstar> mleise: whats the question?
2012-08-07T14:58:00  <mleise> what question?
2012-08-07T14:58:22  <mcstar> "I like this, but I don't know why it is working: http://dpaste.dzfl.pl/521f47a0"
2012-08-07T14:58:23  <mleise> you didn't see the link I posted, did you?
2012-08-07T14:58:29  <mleise> you were offline!
2012-08-07T14:58:39  <mcstar> i sometimes read the log before i join
2012-08-07T15:00:06  <mleise> well, the "static if (__traits(compiles, __traits(parent, n)))" part works, but I don't know what it does
2012-08-07T15:01:27  <mcstar> whats the difference between line 20 and 26?
2012-08-07T15:01:51  <mcstar> ah ok
2012-08-07T15:01:58  <mcstar> i get it
2012-08-07T15:02:02  <mleise> Parent should return the parent 'symbol' of n. And I don't know why that works exactly only when n is not a compile-time value, lol
2012-08-07T15:02:04  <mcstar> answer is a const global
2012-08-07T15:02:12  <mcstar> so it CAN ecaluate the answer at compile time
2012-08-07T15:02:25  <mcstar> first i thought the different calling convention causes it
2012-08-07T15:02:41  <mleise> yes. this was a test for a news group question. someone wanted compile time evaluation with the same syntax as run-time evaluation
2012-08-07T15:03:03  <mleise> You are partially right about calling conventions.
2012-08-07T15:03:37  <mleise> Usually you write "enum x = foo()" to force the compiler to make variable x a compile-time manifest constant.
2012-08-07T15:04:30  <mleise> and now with this hack, depending on the arguments alone the compiler switches between ctfe and rte
2012-08-07T15:05:11  <mleise> that seems minor, but could be handy for such numerical functions
2012-08-07T15:05:23  <mcstar> first of all, its ugly
2012-08-07T15:05:34  <mleise> nooooo
2012-08-07T15:05:37  <mcstar> yes
2012-08-07T15:05:54  <mleise> ok, a bit. but it is *special*
2012-08-07T15:06:38  <mcstar> how so?
2012-08-07T15:06:39  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2012-08-07T15:06:46  <mleise> do that in Haskell :p
2012-08-07T15:07:05  <mcstar> you say that if it was any harder...
2012-08-07T15:07:13  <mleise> Oo  not?
2012-08-07T15:07:19  <mcstar> maybe you havent heard of template haskell
2012-08-07T15:07:51  <mleise> no
2012-08-07T15:08:03  <mcstar> the real problem is:
2012-08-07T15:08:13  <mcstar> i just heard of it
2012-08-07T15:08:16  <mcstar> thats all
2012-08-07T15:08:43  <mleise> hehe, alright. but I doubt that you switch a parameter for another and it will evaluate everything at compile time.
2012-08-07T15:09:10  <mleise> or maybe actually these functional languages can do that, since fibonacci is actually a typical pure function
2012-08-07T15:09:22  <mleise> so the result can be given if the input is constant
2012-08-07T15:09:34  <mcstar> i dont know, i would conjecture that it is possible, but cant say for certain
2012-08-07T15:10:05  <mcstar> if (__traits(compiles, __traits(parent, n)))
2012-08-07T15:10:14  <mcstar> mleise: what is not clear about this line?
2012-08-07T15:10:34  <mcstar> it makes sense for me(maybe i dont understand it thats why)
2012-08-07T15:11:01  <mleise> mcstar: this is ugly: http://unlines.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/tricking-ghc-into-evaluating-recursive-functions-at-compile-time/
2012-08-07T15:11:24  <mleise> what is the parent of 'n' I'm asking
2012-08-07T15:12:31  <mleise> I can see that a literal like 123 doesn't have a parent and is evaluated in the else branch and I can see that a normal variable has some sort of sourrounding scope and if it is just the module
2012-08-07T15:12:34  <mcstar> whatever the parent of n is, the 'compiles' property is false for it
2012-08-07T15:12:45  <mleise> but why is a const variable without parent?
2012-08-07T15:12:50  <mcstar> if its a run time vluse, it makes sense that it cant be used at compile time
2012-08-07T15:13:34  <mcstar> no, i dont think that it has no parent
2012-08-07T15:13:50  <mcstar> i think 'parent' is like a compile-time-kind-type
2012-08-07T15:13:55  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-07T15:14:09  <mleise> no, parent doesn't compile if something is without parent
2012-08-07T15:14:23  <mleise> that's why I used 'compiles' around it
2012-08-07T15:14:37  <mleise> it says ERROR: 123 doesn't have a parent
2012-08-07T15:14:42  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-07T15:14:46  <mcstar> i was guessing
2012-08-07T15:14:57  * mcstar is wrong, he is out of the game
2012-08-07T15:15:06  * mcstar takes no money home
2012-08-07T15:15:19  <mcstar> mleise: what you linked, is actually a powerful feature of ghc
2012-08-07T15:15:31  <mcstar> but it is not template or meta-programming
2012-08-07T15:15:41  <mleise> now if I look at 'b' and 'n' defined in main() I don't see why only one of them has a parent
2012-08-07T15:16:14  <mcstar> that rule-based simplification feature is for you to write good looking code, while with the right rules programmed in, you still dont do more work then necesar
2012-08-07T15:16:19  <mcstar> necessary
2012-08-07T15:16:54  <mcstar> mleise: why 'b'?
2012-08-07T15:16:57  <mcstar> b has nothing to do with it
2012-08-07T15:17:02  <mcstar> 2ul*answer
2012-08-07T15:17:29  <mleise> oh shit, maybe i made mistake
2012-08-07T15:19:12  <mleise> alright *phew* I updated the code
2012-08-07T15:19:21  <mleise> I mean 'k' now :p
2012-08-07T15:20:50  <mleise> it's a regular proper variable sitting there, like 'n'. I think I'm abusing a compiler bug there
2012-08-07T15:20:54  <mcstar> mleise: btw, john carter sucks
2012-08-07T15:21:04  <mcstar> its a shitty steampunk
2012-08-07T15:21:33  <mcstar> did you see it?
2012-08-07T15:21:43  <mleise> no, but I says 'Disney'
2012-08-07T15:21:53  <mcstar> you told me about it
2012-08-07T15:21:59  <mcstar> do y ou remember?\
2012-08-07T15:22:25  <mleise> I didn't tell you about *that* movie
2012-08-07T15:22:36  <mcstar> you mentioned it
2012-08-07T15:22:41  <mcstar> that it is coming out
2012-08-07T15:22:51  <mcstar> it was quite some time ago
2012-08-07T15:23:22  <mcstar> so, i read the imdb short plot: guy transplants to mars blahblahblah
2012-08-07T15:23:38  <mcstar> i thought, ok, i give it a watch
2012-08-07T15:23:47  <mcstar> since i was already disappointed with Prometheus
2012-08-07T15:24:20  <mleise> Maybe another one: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199753/
2012-08-07T15:24:47  <mcstar> real story is: a soldier from some 18th war teleports to mars, where are some kind of aliens and human dinasties
2012-08-07T15:24:51  <mcstar> sort of like dune
2012-08-07T15:25:05  <mcstar> anyway, the setting is quite like a steampunk, and i hate that
2012-08-07T15:25:31  <mcstar> i know red planet
2012-08-07T15:25:37  <mleise> i have no strong feelings about steampunk. i find it odd at times, but ok
2012-08-07T15:25:48  <mcstar> tom seizemore plays a physicist
2012-08-07T15:25:57  <mcstar> but he tells the most idiotic things
2012-08-07T15:26:54  <mleise> hehe, yeah what could you expect. but that's the authors fault
2012-08-07T15:28:14  <mleise> i liked that movie. it had some good parts, like Carrie-Ann Moss, the landing pod, the abyss, the suffocation and the mystery about what happened to the terraforming
2012-08-07T15:28:38  <mcstar> ok, it wasnt completely bad
2012-08-07T15:28:39  <mleise> oh and the 1mm foldable computer display
2012-08-07T15:28:46  <mcstar> i didnt delete it
2012-08-07T15:28:50  <mleise> hehe
2012-08-07T15:28:56  <mcstar> oh, the widescreen scroll?
2012-08-07T15:29:00  <mleise> I deleted Nirvana
2012-08-07T15:29:01  <mcstar> thats nice
2012-08-07T15:29:05  <mcstar> oh, nirvana
2012-08-07T15:29:10  <mcstar> christopher lambert?
2012-08-07T15:29:14  <mleise> yes
2012-08-07T15:29:24  <mcstar> thats based on neuromancer
2012-08-07T15:29:27  <mcstar> great movie
2012-08-07T15:29:31  <mleise> It was alright the first time, but the second time I couldn't stand it
2012-08-07T15:30:14  <mcstar> do  you like the alien movies?
2012-08-07T15:30:21  <mleise> although the starting scene in nirvana was nice, where the italian guy gains a conciousness and tries to make sense of his sourroundings
2012-08-07T15:30:41  <mleise> and talks like a maniac to the protitute
2012-08-07T15:30:56  <mleise> Yes, Alien was great.
2012-08-07T15:31:33  <mcstar> so, you want to see Prometheus then
2012-08-07T15:31:48  <mleise> I just recently played the Gameboy Color game on an emulator :p
2012-08-07T15:32:08  <mleise> good thing is you can save often there
2012-08-07T15:32:27  <mcstar> yeah ok, im trying to say something here
2012-08-07T15:32:30  <mcstar> Prometheus
2012-08-07T15:32:39  <mcstar> got it?
2012-08-07T15:32:51  <mcstar> i want to tell your subconscious that you want to watch it
2012-08-07T15:35:54  <mleise> ok, so I watched their trailer
2012-08-07T15:36:07  <mleise> and some dude is asking "why is this door open?"
2012-08-07T15:36:21  <mleise> i hope the plot is better than that
2012-08-07T15:36:55  <mleise> but actually they showed to much of the movie. now I know there is some alien glue that transforms into a ship with little grey men
2012-08-07T15:37:08  <mcstar> http://sprunge.us/eLbc
2012-08-07T15:37:20  <mleise> and they want to attack the earth for some reason and I expect the humans to win
2012-08-07T15:38:30  <mcstar> i have no idea when will i have time to watch my movies again
2012-08-07T15:38:47  <mleise> what the heck is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead
2012-08-07T15:38:55  <mcstar> this is what happens usually: i decide that im going to watch some movie
2012-08-07T15:38:59  <mcstar> i try to find one
2012-08-07T15:39:03  <mcstar> i cant find one
2012-08-07T15:39:08  <mcstar> and then i watch Matrix
2012-08-07T15:39:36  <mcstar> tim roth and some other guy's philosphical drama
2012-08-07T15:39:50  <mcstar> not bad, its funny
2012-08-07T15:39:50  <mleise> hehe, have you seen The Matador ?
2012-08-07T15:39:54  <mcstar> no
2012-08-07T15:40:11  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-07T15:40:13  <mcstar> im idiot
2012-08-07T15:40:14  <mleise> ok, now you have a movie you can watch besides matrix
2012-08-07T15:40:20  <mcstar> thats gary oldman
2012-08-07T15:40:31  <mcstar> 'the other guy'
2012-08-07T15:40:51  <mcstar> mleise: what do you mean?
2012-08-07T15:40:57  <mcstar> is this Matador any good?
2012-08-07T15:41:33  <mleise> yes, sure. it's a a bit funny, a bit sad, a bit shocking
2012-08-07T15:41:51  <mleise> so you can watch it in any mood
2012-08-07T15:42:19  <mleise> just don't read what it is about
2012-08-07T15:42:22  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2012-08-07T15:42:24  <mcstar> i did
2012-08-07T15:42:30  <mleise> or at least I learnt not to do that
2012-08-07T15:42:43  <mcstar> yeah, thats a great idea
2012-08-07T15:42:46  <mleise> It's always like I have seen the movie before and know whats happening
2012-08-07T15:42:50  <mcstar> but then, how do you decide what to watch??

2012-08-07T15:43:05  <mleise> other people telling me "watch this"?
2012-08-07T15:43:15  <mcstar> they do?
2012-08-07T15:43:23  <mcstar> well, i dont listen to other people
2012-08-07T15:43:31  <mleise> yes, but sometimes their choices wouldn't be mine
2012-08-07T15:44:06  <mcstar> anyway, this matador is probably not on the same level as matrix
2012-08-07T15:44:14  <mleise> seen Memento?
2012-08-07T15:44:19  <mcstar> they are not really interchangable
2012-08-07T15:44:27  <mcstar> the matrix is the BEST movie
2012-08-07T15:44:39  <mleise> yes, the matrix is aweseome now get over it
2012-08-07T15:44:45  <mcstar> i cant
2012-08-07T15:44:53  <mcstar> im sorry, really, but i cant get over it
2012-08-07T15:44:55  <mleise> but star wars was also awesome
2012-08-07T15:45:05  <mcstar> i dont give a flying fuck about star wars :)
2012-08-07T15:45:11  <mleise> just remember the epic fighting on the ice plane
2012-08-07T15:45:25  <mleise> and what about lord of the rings?
2012-08-07T15:45:35  <mleise> all these awesome trilogies
2012-08-07T15:45:41  <mcstar> bleh
2012-08-07T15:45:51  <mcstar> revenge of the sith is good
2012-08-07T15:45:59  <mcstar> i like how anakin transforms
2012-08-07T15:46:02  <mleise> matrix actually sucks. how are human bodies supposed to produce energy? hello?
2012-08-07T15:46:10  <mcstar> they do
2012-08-07T15:46:22  <mcstar> well, not produce
2012-08-07T15:46:33  <mleise> oh and tell me how many cows are they fed for that
2012-08-07T15:46:33  <mcstar> energy cannot be produced
2012-08-07T15:46:46  <mleise> I'm saying the human body is a consumer
2012-08-07T15:47:16  <mcstar> i dont think you watched Animatrix
2012-08-07T15:47:27  <mcstar> great animated prequel to the matrix
2012-08-07T15:47:30  <mleise> + without being able to see or move, both the eyes would be blind by the time neo is released and he couldn't move, alright?
2012-08-07T15:47:42  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-07T15:47:58  <mcstar> maybe i am blind
2012-08-07T15:48:00  <mcstar> but i dont care
2012-08-07T15:48:11  <mcstar> every time i watch it, theres something i didnt notice before
2012-08-07T15:48:13  <mleise> fanboy ;)
2012-08-07T15:48:19  <mcstar> and it is full of meaning
2012-08-07T15:48:35  <mleise> hmm, I watch BSG to that extent
2012-08-07T15:48:47  <mcstar> i probably made up 3-4 times more things than what the wachowski's envisioned
2012-08-07T15:48:51  <mleise> everytime I watch that I notice something new. some hint the directors put into it
2012-08-07T15:48:59  <mcstar> more meaning *
2012-08-07T15:49:19  <mcstar> i think im seeing things that they didnt think about
2012-08-07T15:49:25  <mcstar> and im started to memorize the script
2012-08-07T15:49:28  <mcstar> -m
2012-08-07T15:49:30  <mleise> me too
2012-08-07T15:49:42  <mleise> I'm talking synchroneous to the actors
2012-08-07T15:49:47  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-07T15:49:52  <mcstar> but BSg is a long series
2012-08-07T15:49:55  <mcstar> thats too much
2012-08-07T15:49:56  <mleise> llike "what the frak?!"
2012-08-07T15:50:06  <mcstar> even the trilogy is long enough
2012-08-07T15:50:12  <mleise> "screw me!" - "You're not my type."
2012-08-07T15:50:16  <mleise> *boom*
2012-08-07T15:50:51  <mcstar> i think my second favorite movie is Heat
2012-08-07T15:50:59  <mleise> but I also begin to see more and more flaws in the progression of the series. some decisons seem arbitrary
2012-08-07T15:51:07  <mleise> never watched that one
2012-08-07T15:51:15  <mcstar> robert deniro, tom sizemore, val kilmer charlize theron...
2012-08-07T15:51:43  <mcstar> and ofc al pacino
2012-08-07T15:51:47  <mcstar> it is a masterpiece
2012-08-07T15:52:12  <mcstar> thief-cop cat and mouse action
2012-08-07T15:53:18  <mleise> looks like a lot of quality action :)
2012-08-07T15:53:48  <mcstar> the action is good
2012-08-07T15:53:54  <mcstar> but thats not the reason i like it
2012-08-07T15:54:05  <mcstar> that movie creates a certain atmosphere
2012-08-07T15:54:20  <mcstar> every time i watch it, i canimmerse in that athmosphere
2012-08-07T15:56:05  <mcstar> the actions i like are the die hard series and the lethal weapon ones
2012-08-07T15:57:11  <mcstar> and i like martial arts movies too
2012-08-07T15:58:14  <mleise> ok, 40 minutes of movie talk + commercials = 1 hr. this episode is over, see you next week
2012-08-07T15:58:31  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-07T15:58:33  <mcstar> bb
