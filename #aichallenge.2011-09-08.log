2011-09-08T10:15:40  <antimatroid> wtf
2011-09-08T10:16:19  <sigh> ?
2011-09-08T10:16:26  <antimatroid> it's from a gta IV mod
2011-09-08T10:16:49  <antimatroid> without looking at the arches and being told I'd think it was a photo
2011-09-08T10:16:58  <sigh> wow... yeah
2011-09-08T10:17:01  <mcstar> i spot the grass right away
2011-09-08T10:17:07  <mcstar> its artificial
2011-09-08T10:17:21  <antimatroid> yeah that's a bit obvious, but not sure i'd pick it without being told
2011-09-08T10:17:29  <mcstar> look at the grass or wtf beside the arches
2011-09-08T10:17:48  <antimatroid> still pretty amazing
2011-09-08T10:17:57  <mcstar> another thing, is that the red tiles are 1d, not bump-mapped
2011-09-08T10:18:09  <mcstar> thats a pretty serious error
2011-09-08T10:18:26  <mcstar> they can make it much more "real" these days
2011-09-08T10:18:59  <mcstar> but not bad all in all
2011-09-08T10:19:21  <antimatroid> it's crazy how good graphics can be these days yet something like tron can still be difficult
2011-09-08T10:19:31  <mcstar> when i first took a look at it, i thought is that a hdr image?
2011-09-08T10:19:50  <mcstar> theres a big contrast between outside(the whie stairs) and inside the wtf
2011-09-08T10:20:06  <mcstar> white*
2011-09-08T10:20:13  <antimatroid> the tree trunk gives it away too
2011-09-08T10:20:17  <antimatroid> but i think the leaves are pretty good

2011-09-08T10:23:41  <antimatroid> snake bots a pretty terrible idea for ants :P
2011-09-08T10:24:19  <mcstar> but the ai behind it isnt
2011-09-08T10:24:30  <mcstar> it was a good learning experience
2011-09-08T10:24:37  <mcstar> just what i hoped for
2011-09-08T10:24:53  <mcstar> antimatroid: btw, they arent really terrible
2011-09-08T10:25:04  <mcstar> i didnt have 1 giant snake
2011-09-08T10:25:22  <mcstar> you start out with separate ants, than later, you stick them together
2011-09-08T10:25:28  <mcstar> or just enable them to grow
2011-09-08T10:25:36  <mcstar> they can be pretty good with offensive
2011-09-08T10:27:18  <mcstar> are the workers still down?
2011-09-08T10:28:16  <antimatroid> i would just have ants go to each other to attack
2011-09-08T10:29:19  <mcstar> i say lets launch

2011-09-08T15:48:10  <delt0r> having issues working out how food rate spawing is handeled.
2011-09-08T15:48:32  <delt0r> greping all the code does not give such a clear picture
2011-09-08T15:49:00  <delt0r> is food rate per player? is it the number of food that respawns each turn?
2011-09-08T15:49:59  <delt0r> even just a hint on where in the code it is...
2011-09-08T15:50:06  <mcstar> the food spawning tries to be symmetric, and prefers sites that no food spawned before(or for the longest time)
2011-09-08T15:51:10  <mcstar> and i think theres an exclusion-range, doesnt spawn too close to ants, and there are certain points on the map, where because of symmetry no food can be spawned
2011-09-08T15:51:33  <mcstar> because for example many(the number of players) food would appear near each other
2011-09-08T15:55:01  <mcstar> delt0r: ants.py:600
2011-09-08T15:55:06  <mcstar> have you seen that section?
2011-09-08T15:55:20  <delt0r> what about the spawn rate...does this include "failed" food spawns... or is it guaranteed

2011-09-08T15:55:40  <mcstar> :641 sry
2011-09-08T15:55:43  <delt0r> that is for a ant spawning from food?

2011-09-08T15:57:14  <mcstar> another is on 1054
2011-09-08T15:57:41  <mcstar> you can trace the calls back one by one
2011-09-08T15:58:05  <mcstar> but if you want a general picture without this, then you need to talk to mcleo

2011-09-08T15:59:07  <delt0r> right
2011-09-08T15:59:14  <delt0r> seems overly complicated
2011-09-08T15:59:36  <mcstar> i think there are reasons why that is
2011-09-08T15:59:51  <mcstar> with a naive food spawning alg. there are concerns about fairness
2011-09-08T15:59:53  <delt0r> I have my doubts they are good ones ;)
2011-09-08T16:00:28  <delt0r> if its random... its fair enough if the games are played enough
2011-09-08T16:00:34  <delt0r> IMO...
2011-09-08T16:01:06  <mcstar> thats what i said when i first heard the concerns
2011-09-08T16:01:28  <mcstar> but there are a couple of things to consider
2011-09-08T16:01:48  <mcstar> for example very much depends on how well can a bot manage the initial inflation
2011-09-08T16:02:16  <mcstar> so if theres a random unfairness, it can even decide the outcome
2011-09-08T16:02:26  <delt0r> yea--but that is part of the strategy... not the engine
2011-09-08T16:02:39  <mcstar> and all the maps with the same opponents arent played enough times
2011-09-08T16:02:54  <delt0r> So right now there is "team areas" and even "make sure they can see something"
2011-09-08T16:03:28  <mcstar> sry, i dont quite follow
2011-09-08T16:04:18  <delt0r> the current version checks to see what bot can get where first...then classes that as that bots zone... and places food "fairly" within that
2011-09-08T16:04:39  <delt0r> then it makes sure there is food within sight range at the start as well
2011-09-08T16:04:47  <mcstar> yeah, it computes a wigner-seitz cell
2011-09-08T16:04:54  <delt0r> seems like a lot of baby sitting to me
2011-09-08T16:05:34  <mcstar> well, maybe the second thing isnt necessary, but one can argue about it
2011-09-08T16:06:37  <mcstar> what i "recommended" is to keep the dPdV linear with r
2011-09-08T16:06:53  <delt0r> not what i would have called... voronoi  diagram on a odd metric
2011-09-08T16:06:56  <mcstar> if r is centered on an initial ant
2011-09-08T16:07:35  <mcstar> the ants are distributed periodically, so i guess WS is more applicable
2011-09-08T16:07:45  <delt0r> meh.. what was wrong with random... the "unfairness" will be smaller than when something is changed in the last weeks anyway... which will probably happen
2011-09-08T16:08:14  <mcstar> delt0r: have you witnessed many intial explosions/inflations?
2011-09-08T16:08:22  <delt0r> ??
2011-09-08T16:08:24  <mcstar> these things matter

2011-09-08T16:08:48  <mcstar> we looked at them before that code wasnt changed to this,  randomness matteres
2011-09-08T16:08:52  <mcstar> mattered*
2011-09-08T16:09:28  <delt0r> but if your maps have symmetries even that would have been easier to use...Just require the same symetries with food
2011-09-08T16:10:07  <mcstar> yeah, well now tha food spawning is symmetric
2011-09-08T16:10:40  <mcstar> of course not always, and as the game progresses lesser and lesser
2011-09-08T16:11:08  <mcstar> anyway ive got to hunt down a bug
2011-09-08T16:21:20  <mcstar> bug eliminated
