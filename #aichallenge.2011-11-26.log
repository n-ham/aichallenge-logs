2011-11-26T03:45:14  <thestinger> so much for sleeping
2011-11-26T03:45:49  <Cyndre> Im working on a ray tracer and had a really wierd thought
2011-11-26T03:46:57  <Cyndre> remember reading how photons dissapear and reappear further along their path and its explained by hitting an atom and the atom releasing a new photon or something along those lines
2011-11-26T03:48:24  <Cyndre> so now with ray tracing if you bounding box the empty area, you can eliminate a ton of checks - and it amounts to almost the same thing the photon is doing - magically jumping across some empty space
2011-11-26T03:49:01  <thestinger> dognose: just print to stderr
2011-11-26T03:49:30  <thestinger> you can run playgame.py with -E, which will log stderr output for each bot

2011-11-26T04:29:12  <dognose> well, open the stream is not necessary you're right. But fwrite(STDOUT, "Hello World!"); "should be" the way to go.... still nothing in logs...
2011-11-26T04:30:10  <thestinger> fwrite(STDERR, "string"); then
2011-11-26T04:30:19  <thestinger> stdout goes to the engine
2011-11-26T04:37:07  <dognose> tried it both. Well, if i ran the "bot" with a test-script in the console, the script works without erroers and the output is working. but if i use the demo batch, the bot "crashes" when reaching the fwrite command. (Well, lets day as soon, as i add it somewhere)
2011-11-26T05:02:20  <dognose> posted it to the forums, maybe somebody already dicked into that.
2011-11-26T05:02:27  <dognose> *digged ;)

2011-11-26T06:37:41  <mcstar> like an in-game hud gui or something
2011-11-26T06:37:59  <mcstar> no necessarily 3d, but something real slick
2011-11-26T06:38:02  <mcstar> t
2011-11-26T06:40:47  <delt0r_> mcstar: ??
2011-11-26T06:41:04  <delt0r_> what do you mean? there are some nice ones for opengl
2011-11-26T06:41:44  <mcstar> delt0r_: ??
2011-11-26T06:41:47  <mcstar> give me the links
2011-11-26T06:42:01  <mcstar> and i dont think there are
2011-11-26T06:42:15  <mcstar> there is no such toolkit
2011-11-26T06:42:31  <mcstar> well, ive seen some initive but sucked
2011-11-26T06:43:20  <mcstar> delt0r_: i hope you dont think i dont know about compositing wms
2011-11-26T06:43:26  <mcstar> im not talking about them
2011-11-26T06:43:47  <mcstar> and i would like to have a tiling wm that looks real slick
2011-11-26T06:43:59  <delt0r_> but you mean window manager yea?
2011-11-26T06:44:00  <mcstar> and one that integrates well with the toolkit
2011-11-26T06:44:07  <mcstar> thats a bonus
2011-11-26T06:44:11  <mcstar> the main thing is the toolkit
2011-11-26T06:44:12  <thestinger> you could probably build something really neat on e17, I think they have a 3D compositing wm now
2011-11-26T06:44:18  <delt0r_> well there  is one that works well for games... TWL
2011-11-26T06:44:29  <delt0r_> its a java->opengl one
2011-11-26T06:44:35  <delt0r_> its not a full wm
2011-11-26T06:44:36  <mcstar> there are tons of gtk/qt apps, but they will never look that slick
2011-11-26T06:44:40  <delt0r_> hence the ??
2011-11-26T06:44:46  <delt0r_> they can
2011-11-26T06:45:17  <mcstar> the other problem is content
2011-11-26T06:45:29  <delt0r_> mcstar: in my experience there is no tool kit that make nice slick GUI/Whatever without a *lot* of work
2011-11-26T06:45:29  <mcstar> when will a pdf reader look like some document reader in tron?
2011-11-26T06:46:11  <mcstar> see what i mean? even if the gui is themed, you would still need to theme the content
2011-11-26T06:46:15  <delt0r_> too much manual adjustment is always needed... they are all crap in that respect...
2011-11-26T06:46:38  <delt0r_> TWL stands for Themed Widget Libaray
2011-11-26T06:46:39  <mcstar> i tried e17
2011-11-26T06:46:49  <delt0r_> there is nothing without a theme...
2011-11-26T06:47:01  <mcstar> themable
2011-11-26T06:47:11  <delt0r_> also there are problems with pixel and scale free
2011-11-26T06:47:18  <delt0r_> its 2011 for gods sake
2011-11-26T06:47:40  <delt0r_> and a high res small monitor results in unreadalbe GUIs all too often
2011-11-26T06:47:50  <mcstar> delt0r_: when i was on osx there was some options in a tweaker to switch to vector graphics gui?
2011-11-26T06:48:14  <delt0r_> Finally there are the users... no GUI survives contact with Users..
2011-11-26T06:48:28  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-11-26T06:48:33  <delt0r_> mcstar: some... even mac is not consistent
2011-11-26T06:48:43  <delt0r_> So you have a app... it works... well..
2011-11-26T06:49:26  <delt0r_> "well that font is not the same as the font in this window over here..."
2011-11-26T06:49:40  <delt0r_> so they switch back to the app with the font...
2011-11-26T06:49:58  <delt0r_> but it deletes their hdd every 2 months on accident
2011-11-26T06:50:04  <mcstar> delt0r_: im managed to theme the dock

2011-11-26T06:50:41  <delt0r_> we should be past the pixel by now...
2011-11-26T06:53:29  <delt0r_> either way IMO mcstar all gui libs sux.. themes etc are such dirty hacks.. and everyone has to use the same hacks for it to look right
2011-11-26T06:53:38  <delt0r_> and then there are lame standards...
2011-11-26T06:53:52  <mcstar> i dont disagree with you
2011-11-26T06:53:57  <delt0r_> for example pinch to zoom is bloody clumsy... so is swipe
2011-11-26T06:54:11  <mcstar> i dont own a touchscreen
2011-11-26T06:54:19  <delt0r_> but since it is now "standard" you need to support that crap
2011-11-26T06:54:29  <delt0r_> mcstar: doing an andriod game
2011-11-26T06:54:31  <mcstar> i just want a futuristic look on my tiling wm
2011-11-26T06:54:54  <delt0r_> so you are just in if for the themeablity ?
2011-11-26T06:54:55  <mcstar> delt0r_: why would you do that?
2011-11-26T06:55:01  <delt0r_> do what?
2011-11-26T06:55:06  <mcstar> an android game
2011-11-26T06:55:12  <delt0r_> why not?
2011-11-26T06:55:22  <delt0r_> not touching crappy Obj-C
2011-11-26T06:55:25  <mcstar> youre a researcher for gawds sake
2011-11-26T06:55:35  <mcstar> do research
2011-11-26T06:55:35  <delt0r_> gota have your down time ;)
2011-11-26T06:55:39  <mcstar> k
2011-11-26T06:56:01  <delt0r_> after all that is what this is too
2011-11-26T06:56:10  <mcstar> this is better
2011-11-26T06:56:20  <mcstar> you only have to program logic
2011-11-26T06:56:28  <thestinger> mcstar: rewrite i3 or dwm as a wayland compositor :)
2011-11-26T06:56:37  <mcstar> ah wayland
2011-11-26T06:56:54  <mcstar> is it ready for production use?
2011-11-26T06:56:57  <mcstar> or still alpha?
2011-11-26T06:57:01  <thestinger> not ready
2011-11-26T06:57:03  <delt0r_> mcstar: opengl stuff is fun these days...
2011-11-26T06:57:04  <thestinger> and not really alpha
2011-11-26T06:57:10  <thestinger> they have libwayland, and then a demo implementation
2011-11-26T06:57:28  <mcstar> the idea is nice, getting past X
2011-11-26T06:57:28  <thestinger> the idea is that the window manager uses libwayland and _is_ the compositor/display server I think
2011-11-26T06:57:49  <mcstar> yep, and they can run X for compatibility
2011-11-26T06:57:54  <thestinger> I think Qt and GTK both have basic wayland support now
2011-11-26T06:58:12  <thestinger> kwin might end up being the first wayland compositor
2011-11-26T06:58:21  <thestinger> it would be nice if a minimal WM was the first :)
2011-11-26T06:58:35  <mcstar> id like either
2011-11-26T06:58:46  <mcstar> kde and i were friends for a long time
2011-11-26T06:58:57  <thestinger> ah
2011-11-26T06:59:23  <delt0r_> I honestly do "get" the heavy theme crowed... i know its a big deal to people --but it don't get it..
2011-11-26T06:59:37  <delt0r_> my background is plain black
2011-11-26T06:59:43  <delt0r_> is great
2011-11-26T06:59:45  <thestinger> I never see my background
2011-11-26T06:59:51  <mcstar> thestinger: hehe
2011-11-26T07:00:02  <mcstar> i see it when i switch over an empty desktop
2011-11-26T07:00:03  <delt0r_> I honestly *don't* get
2011-11-26T07:00:15  <delt0r_> bit of a typo there.
2011-11-26T07:00:29  <mcstar> where?
2011-11-26T07:01:05  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah, I see it when I do that http://ompldr.org/vYmdsNA
2011-11-26T07:01:56  <mcstar> ive got a bw foggy forest thingy in the background
2011-11-26T07:01:58  <thestinger> I really dislike the whole transparent terminal/window thing, so a background is kind of pointless
2011-11-26T07:03:24  <mcstar> konsole needs a compositing wm for transparency, so it isnt now
2011-11-26T07:03:42  <mcstar> but im not opposed to a slightly transparent console
2011-11-26T07:05:44  <mcstar> i have a stupid bug thats been bothering me for a couple of days
2011-11-26T07:06:01  <thestinger> gcc isn't very good at optimizing out all the C++ standard lib template stuff
2011-11-26T07:06:04  <mcstar> my mouse sometimes misses focus
2011-11-26T07:06:25  <thestinger> hm, what do you mean?
2011-11-26T07:06:35  <mcstar> well, there are open gtk/qt apps
2011-11-26T07:06:39  <mcstar> and i try to click the widget
2011-11-26T07:06:44  <mcstar> and it just doesnt register
2011-11-26T07:07:05  <mcstar> or i try to scroll, and wherevery i do only chromium tabs are switched
2011-11-26T07:07:16  <thestinger> weird
2011-11-26T07:07:23  <mcstar> yep, and annoying
2011-11-26T07:07:43  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-26T07:07:47  <mcstar> and grabs my keyboard too
2011-11-26T07:08:13  <mcstar> i cant use navigate with my usual Super + key shortcuts
2011-11-26T07:08:18  <mcstar> -use
2011-11-26T07:08:39  <thestinger> the only thing that does that to me is flash, because it's evil
2011-11-26T07:08:52  <thestinger> but I think I can still use WM keybindings with super
2011-11-26T07:09:01  <mcstar> yeah, but thats in a browser window, but this happends anywhere
2011-11-26T07:09:34  <mcstar> i probably should exit chromium and see if it happens wo it running
2011-11-26T07:10:13  <thestinger> gcc is actually pretty damn good at optimizing the functional stuff
2011-11-26T07:10:39  <thestinger> I'm just messing around with the C++ functional stuff atm
2011-11-26T07:10:48  <thestinger> I didn't realize gcc did TCO
2011-11-26T07:10:55  <mcstar> it does?
2011-11-26T07:11:03  <thestinger> sometimes
2011-11-26T07:11:28  <thestinger> sometimes it does really stupid inlining stuff though
2011-11-26T07:12:11  <thestinger> -Winline is neat, it tells you when it couldn't inline a function you marked as inline
2011-11-26T07:12:15  <thestinger> or when it decides not to
2011-11-26T07:12:22  <thestinger> it will actually try to recursively inline...
2011-11-26T07:14:12  <mcstar> recursive call unrolling
2011-11-26T07:14:16  <mcstar> :)
2011-11-26T07:15:17  <thestinger> -foptimize-sibling-calls
2011-11-26T07:15:19  <thestinger>     Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

2011-11-26T07:36:06  <mcstar> what?
2011-11-26T07:36:24  <Fluxid> my C code has something like this: if (ic > 0) {
2011-11-26T07:36:30  <Fluxid> ic is -49
2011-11-26T07:36:39  <Fluxid> and it passes and goes inside
2011-11-26T07:36:49  <Fluxid> what...
2011-11-26T07:36:52  <olexs> unsigned int?
2011-11-26T07:37:07  <Fluxid> long
2011-11-26T07:37:23  <Fluxid> afair by default longs are signed, right?
2011-11-26T07:37:25  <mcstar> are you sure it is -49?
2011-11-26T07:37:28  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-26T07:37:45  <Fluxid> yeah...
2011-11-26T07:37:54  <mcstar> how do you know?
2011-11-26T07:38:52  <mcstar> btw, it might be that your compiler is angry with your for the 4 extra spaces
2011-11-26T07:38:54  <Fluxid> before that if i set it to other long (as ic is modified later) and return it later to python... maybe i'll just print it to stderr
2011-11-26T07:38:56  <mcstar> try this:
2011-11-26T07:39:01  <mcstar> if(ic>0){
2011-11-26T07:39:15  <Fluxid> why would this matter?
2011-11-26T07:39:27  <olexs> that'd be a pretty rubbish compiler imho :)
2011-11-26T07:39:27  <mcstar> :S

2011-11-26T07:48:14  <Fluxid> i had PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ii(ii)", ...) and references to longs

2011-11-26T08:42:03  <antimatroid> it's doing multiple bfs's from each ant simultaneously to collect a set of targets, updating a reusable ants search/visited info etc. every time it collects a target

2011-11-26T08:54:07  <antimatroid> do you guys try to explore to squares even if you wont necessarily have a quick path to the square when the ant you see gets in view?
2011-11-26T08:54:35  <antimatroid> or do you try to explore unexplored sections of the map so that you will be able to reach the square once it comes into view fairly fast?
2011-11-26T08:54:55  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-11-26T08:55:50  <antimatroid> altering that has to do with whether you look for targets from a current search loc or just see if if the ant has made it to an unseen loc, and then bombing vision info with or without water blocking
2011-11-26T08:57:01  <antimatroid> i used to search an ant onto a nonseen square and bomb vision without water blocking
2011-11-26T08:57:20  <antimatroid> atm i've decided on searching onto nonseen squares and blocking water for bombing vision
2011-11-26T08:57:28  <mcstar> im studying clumped monolayers from tea(earl grey)
2011-11-26T08:58:24  <antimatroid> i suspect when collecting "not-recently seen squares" it might be better to send an ant in view but not necessarily on a quick path to the location
2011-11-26T08:58:33  <mcstar> well, i have a "search for an unseen tile" and "go to neigboring min-visited cell"
2011-11-26T08:58:57  <antimatroid> yeah that's slightly different
2011-11-26T08:59:18  <antimatroid> consider something like .........a.......%????????

2011-11-26T08:59:36  <antimatroid> if you send a right you will get vision going but a increases their path to the locations if anything interesting is there
2011-11-26T09:00:09  <antimatroid> so it's a question of do you want to get vision now or do you want to be able to get to the location if there's something there once you can see it
2011-11-26T09:00:34  <mcstar> id say vision firts
2011-11-26T09:00:53  <antimatroid> it depends, if you're first searching the map near the start for food
2011-11-26T09:01:06  <antimatroid> you might as well just go to the locations you expect to be able to get to surely?
2011-11-26T09:01:32  <mcstar> well, when i see it, and thres food, another ant might be closer to pick it up
2011-11-26T09:01:48  <mcstar> it doesnt matter
2011-11-26T09:01:54  <antimatroid> yeah, but if you did it this other way you probably already sent that ant to collect the unseen squares :P
2011-11-26T09:01:59  <antimatroid> and will get there even faster
2011-11-26T09:03:07  <mcstar> this is fascinating
2011-11-26T09:03:13  <antimatroid> a1k0n: what do you do? :P minimise the time until you see a square out of view or minimise the expected path length to collect it once it is in view?
2011-11-26T09:03:26  <mcstar> this solid matter, that forms on top of tea
2011-11-26T09:03:35  <antimatroid> :P
2011-11-26T09:03:40  <mcstar> is evenly distributed in the last ~ 1ml of my tea
2011-11-26T09:03:42  <mcstar> at the bottom
2011-11-26T09:03:49  <mcstar> and they are suspended in it
2011-11-26T09:04:04  <mcstar> so when i move the glass and water is disturbed, i can see the dynamics of it
2011-11-26T09:04:18  <mcstar> but volumetrically
2011-11-26T09:04:22  <mcstar> cool

2011-11-26T09:04:38  <antimatroid> fluid dynamics scares me
2011-11-26T09:04:55  <antimatroid> or fluid mechanics
2011-11-26T09:04:58  <SlashV> .. and righly so :) (hi)
2011-11-26T09:05:08  <SlashV> *rightly
2011-11-26T09:05:11  <mcstar> why?
2011-11-26T09:05:30  <antimatroid> because it's applied maths, it's messy and damn near impossible to actually answer sometimes :P
2011-11-26T09:05:32  <SlashV> because it gets difficult very quickly
2011-11-26T09:06:09  <mcstar> some people say classical mechanics is more difficult than quantum mechanics
2011-11-26T09:06:17  <antimatroid> some people are stupid
2011-11-26T09:06:19  <mcstar> because chaos sets in more easily
2011-11-26T09:06:22  <antimatroid> i don't really know either but that's retarded
2011-11-26T09:06:25  <mcstar> no, there is merit to it
2011-11-26T09:06:30  <antimatroid> :P
2011-11-26T09:06:37  <antimatroid> i know almost nothing about most physics
2011-11-26T09:06:42  <antimatroid> but i know a lot of the maths
2011-11-26T09:06:59  <mcstar> well, dynamic systems are fascinating
2011-11-26T09:07:06  <mcstar> whether quantum or not
2011-11-26T09:07:16  <SlashV> agreed
2011-11-26T09:07:19  <mcstar> but they aint scary
2011-11-26T09:07:22  <antimatroid> yeah, i only have a very basic understanding of dynamical systems
2011-11-26T09:07:28  <mcstar> number theory is scary
2011-11-26T09:07:34  <antimatroid> calculus of variations and optimal control theory are awesome though
2011-11-26T09:07:42  <SlashV> things can be fascinating and scary at the seem time
2011-11-26T09:07:42  <antimatroid> i just call differential games multiplayer optimal control
2011-11-26T09:08:02  <mcstar> ok
2011-11-26T09:08:06  <mcstar> well, a clown is scary
2011-11-26T09:08:10  <mcstar> let settle this
2011-11-26T09:08:13  <antimatroid> number theory is scary, algebra is awesome though
2011-11-26T09:08:23  <antimatroid> clowns aren't scary :P
2011-11-26T09:08:33  <mcstar> they are, worse than anythig else
2011-11-26T09:08:39  <mcstar> i hate all of them
2011-11-26T09:08:57  <antimatroid> i don't find them particularly funny, but i wouldn't call them scary :P
2011-11-26T09:09:18  <SlashV> If you just don't go the circus, you  don't have to bother hating clowns
2011-11-26T09:09:36  <thestinger> I had a traumatic experience with a clown at one of my birthday parties when I was a little
2011-11-26T09:09:48  <SlashV> haha
2011-11-26T09:10:11  <thestinger> I don't really remember it very well but my parents tell me about it all the time
2011-11-26T09:10:21  <thestinger> I think I had never seen the clown before and I was just terrified of him :)
2011-11-26T09:10:45  <thestinger> seen a clown before*
2011-11-26T09:10:54  <SlashV> I am scared of parents that enjoy scaring their kids
2011-11-26T09:10:54  <thestinger> wow I really suck at typing on irc
2011-11-26T09:11:02  <antimatroid> thestinger: what do you do with your exploration?
2011-11-26T09:11:03  <SlashV> me 2
2011-11-26T09:11:15  <mcstar> when i was littel i saw a children's show on tv, with a mould-figure(?) that frightened me to death, my dad called the station to stop that show
2011-11-26T09:11:22  <antimatroid> minimise the time until you see a location? or minimise the time until you can get to it?
2011-11-26T09:11:36  <thestinger> well, I have two kinds of exploration
2011-11-26T09:11:52  <mcstar> antimatroid:
2011-11-26T09:11:53  <thestinger> part of it happens in what I call foraging, where I try to maximize view distance basically

2011-11-26T09:11:58  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-26T09:12:04  <antimatroid> say you have .............a.......%???????? which way would you send a?
2011-11-26T09:12:08  <SlashV> bit.ly ftw
2011-11-26T09:12:14  <mcstar> long link, what is do you call that figure?
2011-11-26T09:12:19  <thestinger> and then my spare ants will search for enemy hills
2011-11-26T09:12:35  <mcstar> http://m.blog.hu/sz/szitakoto/image/foto/2011_06/20110605foto_gyurma.jpg
2011-11-26T09:12:49  <mcstar> (-is)
2011-11-26T09:13:02  <antimatroid> if you send him east you get in range of unseen locations faster, but you increase a's path to the unseen locations he's collecting
2011-11-26T09:13:10  <thestinger> antimatroid: depends on when I last visited the known areas
2011-11-26T09:13:20  <thestinger> they get weighted more as time passes
2011-11-26T09:13:31  <thestinger> oh
2011-11-26T09:13:37  <thestinger> you mean becuase the map wraps
2011-11-26T09:14:09  <antimatroid> yeah, what i'm pointing out is you can search for unseen locs in range of a search location, or you can search an ant to an actual unseen loc
2011-11-26T09:14:19  <thestinger> the ant would go west, as long as I know I can't actually get there by going east
2011-11-26T09:14:21  <antimatroid> and you can bomb vision info with or without water blocking depending on which you do
2011-11-26T09:14:54  <antimatroid> thestinger: that's what i'm looking for, and what i plan to do, but you could potentially see not recently seen locations faster if you aren't expecting there to be anything useful there and want to check
2011-11-26T09:14:54  <thestinger> I have a branch where I try to maximize how much of the map is visible, and with that the ant might go east
2011-11-26T09:15:00  <antimatroid> which might be more useful if you have more ants
2011-11-26T09:15:13  <antimatroid> ah yeah okay
2011-11-26T09:15:20  <thestinger> it would go west in that case, but if there were 2 ants one might go east
2011-11-26T09:16:07  <antimatroid> i only realised that distinction with exploration a couple of days ago
2011-11-26T09:16:12  <thestinger> if there were ~5 ants in one place, one would definitely go east to increase the visible % of the map
2011-11-26T09:16:36  <thestinger> that code doesn't really improve my bot atm though
2011-11-26T09:16:37  <antimatroid> i used to collect unseen squares and bomb vision without water blocking, i've at least changed it so i only consider unseen locs in view with water blocked as collected
2011-11-26T09:16:50  <Minthos> argh, I'm fighting someone slow on fluxid
2011-11-26T09:17:00  <Minthos> from the very beginning it takes about 1 s per turn
2011-11-26T09:17:09  <antimatroid> that was me in planet wars :P
2011-11-26T09:17:22  <antimatroid> i think i had one of the few bots that consistently used all its time in planetwars
2011-11-26T09:17:27  <antimatroid> most people used all their time in tron
2011-11-26T09:17:31  <antimatroid> well, most decent bots
2011-11-26T09:17:50  <antimatroid> atm i'm not expecting to be using all the time for this
2011-11-26T09:17:58  <Minthos> well if they use all the time fluxid gives them, they're in trouble on the real server
2011-11-26T09:18:01  <olexs> Minthos: yep, some bot is using all available time... I'm building a system for that in mine right now, should allow for better search depths most of the time
2011-11-26T09:18:20  <thestinger> tcp turntime should really be lowered
2011-11-26T09:18:28  <antimatroid> it's because of network overhead
2011-11-26T09:18:44  <thestinger> yeah, but it could still tell bots the turntime it 500ms
2011-11-26T09:18:47  <antimatroid> what it should do is tell the bots 500ms but still have it at like 3-4 seconds
2011-11-26T09:18:49  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-26T09:18:54  <Minthos> it might help if the tcp server reported a lower turntime to the bots than it actually operated with
2011-11-26T09:18:55  <antimatroid> that's what the past tcp servers did
2011-11-26T09:19:03  <antimatroid> otherwise it's also a pita to have to alter the turn time given
2011-11-26T09:19:12  <antimatroid> it's possible the person doesn't even realise the turn time is that high on tcp?
2011-11-26T09:19:28  <thestinger> my bot will timeout if it actually somehow manages to use all the tcp turntime
2011-11-26T09:19:37  <thestinger> because it only leaves ~50ms of time
2011-11-26T09:19:40  <antimatroid> network overhead probably
2011-11-26T09:19:42  <Minthos> or they just live in africa
2011-11-26T09:19:53  <Minthos> or maybe on iss
2011-11-26T09:20:02  <antimatroid> don't think so, pretty sure we had some people from in africa in planet wars :P
2011-11-26T09:20:16  <thestinger> my round trip time to fluxid.pl is ~114ms
2011-11-26T09:20:31  <thestinger> and I'm in toronto
2011-11-26T09:20:39  <antimatroid> i'm all the way down in tasmania :P
2011-11-26T09:20:57  <olexs> 25ms to fluxid.pl from germany... which makes sense
2011-11-26T09:21:09  <thestinger> olexs: I think the host is actually in german, not poland

2011-11-26T09:24:05  <Minthos> fluxid also said it's hosted in germany
2011-11-26T09:24:07  <olexs> I guess you justify the large overhead time :)
2011-11-26T09:24:07  <thestinger> hetzner is a german host
2011-11-26T09:24:09  <lnx> I have ~35ms from the UK
2011-11-26T09:25:45  <olexs> to think of it, in late game my bot could probably even use all of the 5s time... multiple battle simulations with a lot of ants, with no hard search depth limit (only limited by time available)...
2011-11-26T09:26:47  <thestinger> yeah, I could use up all the time running battle sims
2011-11-26T09:27:03  <thestinger> atm I just simulate two scenarios for each battle, so I handle any number of ants
2011-11-26T09:27:35  <thestinger> I need to figure out how to choose which battles to really optimize
2011-11-26T09:27:43  <olexs> number of ants is not as relevant for my simulations either, but the search tree branches a lot, and if I give it the freedom to deepen it a lot it'll take a while

2011-11-26T09:42:14  <besh> maybe you can try counting it from ant information as they come  "ant 3 4 6". The last one is player number.
2011-11-26T09:42:41  <thestinger> ah, that's a good idea
2011-11-26T09:42:56  <thestinger> that will help with getting a good initial estimate
2011-11-26T09:43:12  <thestinger> but I try to figure out how many players are left, because I'm using it to adjust strategy
2011-11-26T09:44:55  <thestinger> right now I just make a stupid guess about whether a player is still alive based on when I last saw one of their ants
2011-11-26T09:46:00  <besh> you have to be careful when you have few ants though.
2011-11-26T09:46:13  <thestinger> yeah, I don't do it when the % of the map that's visible is low

2011-11-26T10:06:18  <besh> roflmao: How do you use "bot in" to replay a game with your bot ?
2011-11-26T10:06:22  <mcstar> i have a function that saves images of a 2d array
2011-11-26T10:06:30  <mcstar> i have many arrays
2011-11-26T10:06:34  <roflmao> a1k0n taught me this one
2011-11-26T10:06:39  <roflmao> besh: you download the bot in file
2011-11-26T10:06:44  <roflmao> ALL turns
2011-11-26T10:06:51  <roflmao> (I think)
2011-11-26T10:06:52  <mcstar> so what do you do? you give all arrays as reference paraemters to the image saving function? NO
2011-11-26T10:07:02  <roflmao> and then you run your bot directly
2011-11-26T10:07:09  <roflmao> MyBot << file.txt
2011-11-26T10:07:16  <roflmao> err one <
2011-11-26T10:07:22  <mcstar> you give it a lambda, and in the lambda(that takes row,col, and captures this) you provide the values to write to the image
2011-11-26T10:07:22  <roflmao> and obv the bot call depends on the language
2011-11-26T10:07:28  <antimatroid> i do MyBot < in.txt > out.txt
2011-11-26T10:07:40  <antimatroid> and just set up my debug situations like that
2011-11-26T10:08:01  <antimatroid> i also have a program to convert an ascii version of a grid into bot input for debugging
2011-11-26T10:08:24  <besh> I see. I was doing it the long way. I copied one position at a time then save it to file etc..
2011-11-26T10:08:26  <antimatroid> it's a pita to set up the info otherwise
2011-11-26T10:08:35  <antimatroid> besh: so was i until a couple of days ago
2011-11-26T10:08:46  <antimatroid> but it's almost impossible to set up scenarios for explorations etc. like that
2011-11-26T10:08:51  <antimatroid> and makes everything else easier anyway

2011-11-26T10:09:52  <roflmao> it's important to use basic scenarios
2011-11-26T10:09:55  <roflmao> that test very narrow use-cases
2011-11-26T10:10:03  <roflmao> just have a bunch of them
2011-11-26T10:10:12  <roflmao> in which your bot needs to win all of them or do XYZ
2011-11-26T10:10:16  <antimatroid> that's the only way i test my bot :P
2011-11-26T10:10:21  <antimatroid> i don't win them

2011-11-26T10:10:43  <antimatroid> then build a strategy for my bot

2011-11-26T10:17:22  <mcstar> im trying to perfect my navigation algoriths
2011-11-26T10:17:46  <mcstar> so i want them to collaborate in achiving a goal, like standing in formation
2011-11-26T10:18:50  <roflmao> i see
2011-11-26T10:19:15  <mcstar> i was thinking about linking a vector graphics library with my bot

2011-11-26T10:34:37  <delt0r_> one area where the java gui libs shine... fast for crude things... bit slow for compliant
2011-11-26T10:34:47  <mcstar> i write from my bot
2011-11-26T10:34:50  <delt0r_> well i see my bots internal map
2011-11-26T10:35:06  <delt0r_> and the potental maps and things...
2011-11-26T10:35:13  <delt0r_> potential
2011-11-26T10:35:17  <mcstar> yep, sure, i have access to everyhting
2011-11-26T10:35:37  <delt0r_> but its nice in a visulaizer than ascii ;)
2011-11-26T10:35:47  <mcstar> its not ascii
2011-11-26T10:35:50  <delt0r_> i had it as ascii debug output at the start
2011-11-26T10:35:53  <delt0r_> was a bit slow
2011-11-26T10:36:06  <mcstar> delt0r_: they are proper pictures

2011-11-26T10:38:36  <delt0r_> oh you write out images?
2011-11-26T10:38:59  <mcstar> thats what i said yes
2011-11-26T10:39:05  <mcstar> return (float)image_array[row][col];
2011-11-26T10:39:06  <delt0r_> I missunderstood
2011-11-26T10:39:10  <mcstar> this is the important part
2011-11-26T10:39:15  <mcstar> i can change that to anything
2011-11-26T10:39:21  <delt0r_> i am doing a live gui thing
2011-11-26T10:39:24  <mcstar> and write the array i want in any way i want

2011-11-26T10:39:58  <mcstar> delt0r_: i dont want to duplicate the visualizer :D
2011-11-26T10:40:23  <mcstar> i open it up in gwenview, zoom it in, and just scroll back and forth
2011-11-26T10:42:55  <delt0r_> well in my denfense i don't... I just display the image each turn
2011-11-26T10:42:59  <delt0r_> rather than save it

2011-11-26T10:45:47  <avdg> no, just on pure server information
2011-11-26T10:46:10  <avdg> and I wonder if all instances are actually identical
2011-11-26T10:46:32  <delt0r_> ok so now i don't know what your asking...
2011-11-26T10:46:34  <delt0r_> :/
2011-11-26T10:46:46  <avdg> like cpu
2011-11-26T10:46:52  <delt0r_> oh ic
2011-11-26T10:47:05  <delt0r_> well it would be hard to do for the real comp
2011-11-26T10:47:19  <delt0r_> its all virtalized IIRC
2011-11-26T10:47:29  <delt0r_> which means everything you "detect" is wrong
2011-11-26T10:47:42  <avdg> true
2011-11-26T10:48:33  <delt0r_> I can be really wrong to. We have noticed a 2x speed difference on Virtalized instances compared to just plain old servers
2011-11-26T10:48:37  <delt0r_> It can
2011-11-26T10:49:28  <delt0r_> The best you could do is guesstimate with how fast some things are taking..
2011-11-26T10:49:32  <avdg> well, I've read about cpu's with vector support, and the better it is, the better it is to write code thats good in 1 thing
2011-11-26T10:49:50  <avdg> (and only uses less variables)
2011-11-26T10:49:52  <delt0r_> SSE is vector kinda
2011-11-26T10:49:57  <avdg> yeah
2011-11-26T10:50:11  <delt0r_> So anything that can use that will with proper compiler options in C/C++
2011-11-26T10:50:18  <avdg> though I'm still a compiler noob
2011-11-26T10:50:24  <delt0r_> hell even java JIT uses it sometimes
2011-11-26T10:50:48  <avdg> well, I was actually thinking if it could be cheating :p
2011-11-26T10:51:08  <avdg> (which probably isn't, but its a big advantage compared to other languages)
2011-11-26T10:51:13  <delt0r_> In C/C++ alignment are the big things that stop automagic SSE stuff getting used
2011-11-26T10:51:16  <delt0r_> IIRC
2011-11-26T10:51:41  <delt0r_> well using asm blocks would probably mean you don't compile --
2011-11-26T10:52:00  <avdg> nah, I'm not good in asm
2011-11-26T10:52:00  <delt0r_> if its just fast c/c++ for the compiler options... then all power to ya

2011-11-26T10:56:25  <delt0r_> its not your bot state... but its the state your bot should know!
2011-11-26T10:56:47  <antimatroid> what do you mean by should know?
2011-11-26T10:56:52  <antimatroid> does it track food out of sight?
2011-11-26T10:58:28  <antimatroid> doesn't matter now that i think about it
2011-11-26T10:58:31  <delt0r_> no... its  minimum state. ie even a bad bot should know it... too much and then it will have its own bugs
2011-11-26T10:58:35  <antimatroid> just nice to have something to do while the game plays :)
2011-11-26T10:58:53  <delt0r_> so just what can be seen that game turn... found a lot of bugs in my cases
2011-11-26T10:59:33  <antimatroid> damn, now i want to get onto tcp

2011-11-26T11:00:54  <delt0r_> you got something working... play on tcp...

2011-11-26T11:03:14  <antimatroid> not sure i can be bothered avoiding collisions for moves past this turn
2011-11-26T11:04:05  <mcstar> you can say using std::cout;
2011-11-26T11:04:20  <antimatroid> what?
2011-11-26T11:04:29  <antimatroid> if it's in .cc i include namespace std;
2011-11-26T11:04:45  <mcstar> and i dont use the std namespace outside my "main" source code
2011-11-26T11:04:55  <antimatroid> but i follow peoples rules about not forcing people to include namespaces from headers
2011-11-26T11:05:07  <antimatroid> you can fairly safely use it in any .cc/cpp file
2011-11-26T11:05:12  <antimatroid> just not .h
2011-11-26T11:05:22  <mcstar> i only do it in the most edited file
2011-11-26T11:05:37  <mcstar> but fo files i rarely change i prepend stD::
2011-11-26T11:05:45  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm not having a go was just curious :)

2011-11-26T12:39:04  <roflmao> ergo you just look through all the possible moves for both your ants and the enemy ant

2011-11-26T12:41:57  <mcstar> and the random bot steps in attack radius
2011-11-26T12:42:32  <mcstar> but, it can kill them, if the other ant has a lower degree of freedom, for example, if water blocks its way
2011-11-26T12:42:41  <mcstar> then, they will step in for the kill
2011-11-26T12:43:29  <mcstar> but that doesnt happen in that paste

2011-11-26T12:45:01  <roflmao> so you basically check all possible moves of your own ants
2011-11-26T12:45:21  <roflmao> run them by all possible moves of enemy ants and add up the one that works best for all possible moves of enemy ants
2011-11-26T12:45:22  <roflmao> in that region/
2011-11-26T12:45:23  <mcstar> all ants in the battle situation
2011-11-26T12:45:33  <roflmao> since you can't predict the enemy ants
2011-11-26T12:45:39  <roflmao> you got to pick the movement of your ants
2011-11-26T12:45:57  <roflmao> that works best for all possible enemy ant moves
2011-11-26T12:46:02  <Antimony> so you test over all possible enemy moves?

2011-11-26T12:46:34  <Antimony> how do you do it?
2011-11-26T12:46:43  <Antimony> what size is your configuration?
2011-11-26T12:46:44  <mcstar> and evaluate the life/death results after that
2011-11-26T12:46:46  <roflmao> right but
2011-11-26T12:46:53  <roflmao> every configuration
2011-11-26T12:46:57  <roflmao> includes enemy movement?
2011-11-26T12:47:00  <roflmao> or do you assume the enemy is static
2011-11-26T12:47:14  <mcstar> i told you several times: all the ants that are there
2011-11-26T12:47:17  <mcstar> enemy and mine
2011-11-26T12:47:28  <mcstar> i never assumed that the enemy is static
2011-11-26T12:47:29  <Antimony> how do you manage to do it in a reasonable amoutn of time then?
2011-11-26T12:47:39  <Antimony> or do you just give up in large battles?
2011-11-26T12:47:51  <mcstar> Antimony: my benchmark is that i can generate 5^13 moves in 4.2 seconds
2011-11-26T12:47:51  <roflmao> right but what I don't quite get is that the battle resultion depends on enemy ant movement, and you don't want to assume that the enemy ant moves to the position that is "most convenient" for you
2011-11-26T12:48:04  <roflmao> so you're left with not one best score but many best scores depending on what the enemy does
2011-11-26T12:48:12  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-26T12:48:36  <mcstar> i have to check best-worst possible scores for any configuration of my ants
2011-11-26T12:49:00  <roflmao> and then use either an average
2011-11-26T12:49:06  <mcstar> if i detect enemy loss without sacrificing any of my ants i go for it
2011-11-26T12:49:07  <antimatroid> i think i'm ready to give up on doing these searches in one sweep
2011-11-26T12:49:11  <antimatroid> it's so ridiculously messy
2011-11-26T12:49:18  <roflmao> ah I see
2011-11-26T12:49:27  <antimatroid> Antimony: you are on the east coast of aus yeah?
2011-11-26T12:49:32  <antimatroid> you're sleeping pattern is as bad as mine
2011-11-26T12:49:36  <antimatroid> your*

2011-11-26T12:50:09  <Antimony> It's 12:50pm right now
2011-11-26T12:50:19  <roflmao> yeah you could average out all the scores for any configuration of your ants
2011-11-26T12:50:22  <roflmao> and then pick the best average
2011-11-26T12:50:23  <mcstar> no
2011-11-26T12:50:25  <roflmao> but that's probably a dumbass idea
2011-11-26T12:50:27  <mcstar> no averaging
2011-11-26T12:50:40  <mcstar> that goes against the purpose
2011-11-26T12:50:55  <roflmao> right
2011-11-26T12:50:58  <mcstar> you have to know what is the worst and best for any of your moves
2011-11-26T12:50:58  <roflmao> and what's the region you use?
2011-11-26T12:51:00  <roflmao> attack radius 2?
2011-11-26T12:51:08  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-26T12:51:22  <mcstar> it has nothing to do with that
2011-11-26T12:51:36  <mcstar> i prepare formations if an ant sees the enemy
2011-11-26T12:51:36  <roflmao> mcstar: all ants in the battle situation
2011-11-26T12:51:36  <antimatroid> Antimony: oh, not so ridiculous then :P
2011-11-26T12:51:44  <mcstar> if it can get backup, it will
2011-11-26T12:51:49  <roflmao> "battle situation" being a radius of tiles no?
2011-11-26T12:51:53  <Antimony> its' 350 in Australia Eastern time right?
2011-11-26T12:51:57  <Antimony> 3:50am
2011-11-26T12:52:02  <mcstar> after that, they will try to close on the enemies' safety mask
2011-11-26T12:52:13  <mcstar> and after that attak code kicks in
2011-11-26T12:52:41  <roflmao> could you link to a full example of your bot fighitng?
2011-11-26T12:52:44  <roflmao> just curious to see it :)

2011-11-26T12:53:06  <mcstar> it doesnt do really well
2011-11-26T12:53:13  <roflmao> ah
2011-11-26T12:53:14  <antimatroid> 4 50am :P
2011-11-26T12:53:15  <roflmao> that sucks
2011-11-26T12:53:23  <mcstar> since you have to pursue that those situations arise, when a kill-shot is possible
2011-11-26T12:53:29  <mcstar> and it wasnt good at it
2011-11-26T12:53:33  <roflmao> :(
2011-11-26T12:53:54  <mcstar> anyway, my code base is a real mess now
2011-11-26T12:54:06  <mcstar> and im doing the thing i told you before and start from there
2011-11-26T12:54:12  <Antimony> anyway, what is the largest number of enemiees that you can solve in 500ms?
2011-11-26T12:54:39  <mcstar> well, in a previous code, i did the same thing, but for every one of my ants individually
2011-11-26T12:54:49  <mcstar> but my evaluatin was worse
2011-11-26T12:54:55  <mcstar> and was defensive only
2011-11-26T12:55:14  <mcstar> i could do ~6-7 ant situations?
2011-11-26T12:55:18  <Antimony> nice
2011-11-26T12:55:28  <mcstar> so the code that is now up on the main server
2011-11-26T12:55:34  <mcstar> has actually this defensive enumeration
2011-11-26T12:55:40  <mcstar> it doesnt have "safety masks"
2011-11-26T12:55:54  <mcstar> but enumerates, and tries to avoid the enemy

2011-11-26T12:57:04  <mcstar> i mean i cant point to anything
2011-11-26T12:57:15  <mcstar> my enumeration is VERY fast that i know
2011-11-26T12:57:22  <mcstar> but its just basically a 1-liner
2011-11-26T12:57:27  <Antimony> do you do any sort of pruning?
2011-11-26T12:57:33  <Antimony> o approximation?
2011-11-26T12:57:34  <mcstar> the evaluatin slows it dow considerably
2011-11-26T12:57:38  <mcstar> no
2011-11-26T12:58:23  <Antimony> So your evalutating the results of 78 thousand battles in under half a second?

2011-11-26T13:38:44  <janzert> McLeopold_: just for a moment
2011-11-26T13:39:17  <McLeopold_> I was thinking about map size.  I think limiting to 30000 area would be good, but still allow 200x200 max dimensions
2011-11-26T13:39:39  <McLeopold_> also, a minimum of 900 area per player might be good
2011-11-26T13:40:32  <janzert> I was thinking of lower top and bottom numbers but yeah same general idea
2011-11-26T13:40:43  <amstan_> oh my god, this gingerbeer is spicy as hell
2011-11-26T13:40:53  <janzert> did you see instances where 400 was too small?
2011-11-26T13:41:02  <McLeopold_> yeah, at least for more than 2 players
2011-11-26T13:41:16  <janzert> also why are you dividing the top number by number of players again?
2011-11-26T13:41:26  <McLeopold_> am I?
2011-11-26T13:41:37  <janzert> line 30 of cell_maze.py
2011-11-26T13:41:53  <McLeopold_> I multiply by players again, so it's a wash
2011-11-26T13:41:59  <janzert> the real top number there is 15000 currently since players will be at least 2
2011-11-26T13:42:21  <janzert> right it's already a per player number so shouldn't be divided by players again
2011-11-26T13:42:54  <McLeopold_> it's 900 per player to 30000 total
2011-11-26T13:43:01  <McLeopold_> the math is correct
2011-11-26T13:43:41  <janzert> hmm, I would do a per player maximum instead
2011-11-26T13:44:09  <janzert> around 10000 probably

2011-11-26T13:44:46  <McLeopold_> and 10000 is a good number for per player max
2011-11-26T13:45:02  <McLeopold_> the first set of cell maze maps had a bunch around 13000+
2011-11-26T13:45:07  <McLeopold_> those were too big
2011-11-26T13:45:35  <janzert> yeah, the players just seemed to be lost in the expanse for too long

2011-11-26T13:48:54  <antimatroid> is there any good reason not to just use a map from something to bool instead of a set?
2011-11-26T13:48:57  <antimatroid> the syntax is nicer
2011-11-26T13:49:52  <antimatroid> ie. if(aSet[element]) is better than if(aSet.count(element))
2011-11-26T13:51:53  <ikaros> i think map[element] sets the entry if its not already there to the types standard value?!
2011-11-26T13:52:09  <ikaros> thats why i use find at least

2011-11-26T14:37:22  <thestinger> horrible syntax tho
2011-11-26T14:37:52  <mcstar> [] shouldnt be used at all with any kindof maps

2011-11-26T14:41:59  <BenJackson> with sets usually .count() is the easiest thing to use

2011-11-26T14:42:21  <thestinger> if this is just a lucky string of wins I'll be so mad
2011-11-26T14:42:43  <BenJackson> once again I submit the word after strcat_ is a ruse
2011-11-26T14:42:46  <Minthos> mcstar: Return value
2011-11-26T14:42:47  <Minthos> reference to the mapped value of the new element if no element with key key existed. Otherwise a reference to the mapped value of the existing element is returned.
2011-11-26T14:43:07  <mcstar> Minthos: thats doesnt answer it
2011-11-26T14:43:14  <BenJackson> Minthos: remember in a set the object can be part key and part data
2011-11-26T14:43:14  <mcstar> what if theres no "new element"
2011-11-26T14:43:32  <BenJackson> so a set is sort of like a map with an internal key
2011-11-26T14:43:39  <mcstar> 2==unorderedmap[nosuchkey]
2011-11-26T14:43:46  <mcstar> now what does this do?
2011-11-26T14:44:07  <BenJackson> creates nosuchkey as a new key
2011-11-26T14:44:10  <Minthos> mcstar: if your key isn't in the map, a default value will be inserted in its place and a reference to that value returned
2011-11-26T14:44:21  <Minthos> how does that not answer your question?
2011-11-26T14:44:26  <thestinger> BenJackson: _flock just groups together
2011-11-26T14:44:29  <mcstar> what do you mean default?
2011-11-26T14:44:33  <thestinger> I bet it will start dropping in rank
2011-11-26T14:44:35  <mcstar> what is a default value?
2011-11-26T14:44:37  <thestinger> it just got lucky
2011-11-26T14:44:43  <Minthos> it will be created with its default constructor or default value
2011-11-26T14:44:50  <BenJackson> that string of wins isn't against particularly good bots
2011-11-26T14:44:54  <Minthos> for ints, it's 0, for bools it's false afaik
2011-11-26T14:45:06  <mcstar> that is stupid
2011-11-26T14:45:11  <mcstar> bad thing
2011-11-26T14:45:12  <Minthos> yes, but it's how it works
2011-11-26T14:45:24  <Minthos> C++ is stupid
2011-11-26T14:45:41  <BenJackson> well if you want an exception instead use .at()
2011-11-26T14:46:55  <mcstar> i use find, that makes much more sense
2011-11-26T14:47:31  <thestinger> Minthos: false and 0 are the same thing :)
2011-11-26T14:47:40  <thestinger> bools are just numbers that hold 1 and 0 in C and C++
2011-11-26T14:48:01  <thestinger> well, I guess they hold _at least_ 1 and 0
2011-11-26T14:48:05  <Minthos> conceptually they're different
2011-11-26T14:48:25  <Minthos> false == 0 but true != 1
2011-11-26T14:48:54  <thestinger> true + 5 is 6, but ofc other values are also true
2011-11-26T14:49:03  <thestinger> programming languages aren't always very logical
2011-11-26T14:49:20  <mcstar> except logic programing languages :)
2011-11-26T14:49:23  <thestinger> C++ doesn't try to stop you from using bools as numbers
2011-11-26T14:49:24  <thestinger> it's annoying
2011-11-26T14:49:38  <thestinger> gcc should at least have a warning option to do that
2011-11-26T14:49:58  <thestinger> I mean seriously, try -Weffc++
2011-11-26T14:50:06  <thestinger> if they can add crap like that they could add some useful warnings too
2011-11-26T14:50:31  <p_l> there would be a warning whenever you use C++, then
2011-11-26T14:50:45  <Anilm3> hahaha
2011-11-26T14:52:56  <BenJackson> you're just looking at it wrong
2011-11-26T14:53:05  <BenJackson> if you came from C you'd think C++ was great!
2011-11-26T14:53:10  <thestinger> p_l: that's what -Weffc++ does
2011-11-26T14:53:22  <thestinger> it warns you for everything, because you can't write effective C++
2011-11-26T14:53:28  <thestinger> I'm actually serious...

2011-11-26T14:54:04  <thestinger> struct something { int i; };
2011-11-26T14:54:08  <thestinger> -Weffc++ will warn if you do that
2011-11-26T14:54:11  <BenJackson> p_l: is your contest bot in C?
2011-11-26T14:54:38  <Anilm3> I also prefer C, but for stuff like this it's faster to use C++
2011-11-26T14:55:10  <p_l> BenJackson: the fact that I prefer a structured assembler over a clusterfuck doesn't mean I'm writing my bot in assembler
2011-11-26T14:55:16  <BenJackson> I used to prefer C but now I know C++ well enough that I just see it as a faster way to write C
2011-11-26T14:55:30  <thestinger> I like C better as a language
2011-11-26T14:55:34  <thestinger> but I like coding in C++ more
2011-11-26T14:55:38  * p_l uses CL, assuming he will get enough time to actually sit down and submit it
2011-11-26T14:55:38  <BenJackson> when I was vague on when C++ was going to do stuff like construct, destruct, copy, etc, I didn't like it
2011-11-26T14:55:57  <thestinger> C is fairly elegant and simple
2011-11-26T14:56:08  <BenJackson> and K&R is awesome

2011-11-26T14:57:11  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-26T14:57:18  <mcstar> so C is a half-dead language too
2011-11-26T14:57:27  <Anilm3> I disagree
2011-11-26T14:57:32  <Minthos> C has a life of its own
2011-11-26T14:57:35  <mcstar> :D and im only kidding
2011-11-26T14:57:37  <thestinger> C isn't dead

2011-11-26T14:57:54  <thestinger> even if people didn't actually use C, I think Objective-C is actually a true superset of it (unlike C++)

2011-11-26T14:58:26  <Minthos> objective-c is nice
2011-11-26T14:58:44  <Anilm3> and useless for non-apple users
2011-11-26T14:58:54  <mcstar> why?
2011-11-26T14:59:02  <mcstar> gcc has obj-c
2011-11-26T14:59:07  <Anilm3> well you can try and do stuff with it
2011-11-26T14:59:31  <Anilm3> but nobody uses outside the apple world
2011-11-26T14:59:35  <mcstar> its like saying c# is useless because ms has a gui toolkit over it
2011-11-26T14:59:37  <avdg> microsoft?
2011-11-26T14:59:49  <Minthos> there aren't a whole lot of libraries for it, so you have to use C and C++ libs for a lot of things
2011-11-26T14:59:59  <Anilm3> exactly Minthos
2011-11-26T15:00:02  <p_l> unfortunately, there's little use of Objective-C outside Apple
2011-11-26T15:00:09  <thestinger> mcstar: mono isn't .NET though, C# is a lot less useful without the whole platform
2011-11-26T15:00:29  <p_l> Anilm3: however, Objective-C is perfectly fine with using C code :)
2011-11-26T15:00:39  <thestinger> and silverlight is a lot less useful without DRM, because only goddamn netflix uses it
2011-11-26T15:01:29  <p_l> thestinger: and WP7
2011-11-26T15:01:55  <thestinger> since windows 8 uses HTML5 + javascript, I bet they'll dump silverlight from windows phone eventually
2011-11-26T15:02:06  <BenJackson> netflix on the kindle fire is nice :)
2011-11-26T15:02:08  <thestinger> and they plan on using regular windows 8 on tablets iirc, not WP7
2011-11-26T15:02:29  <p_l> thestinger: Silverlight forms basis of the API used in WP7, so no, it won't be "dumped"
2011-11-26T15:02:42  <thestinger> it will when they just start using regular windows on phones :)
2011-11-26T15:03:17  <Anilm3> windows 8 will really be HTML5 and javascript?
2011-11-26T15:03:28  <avdg> yeah
2011-11-26T15:03:33  <avdg> and I have doubts about it
2011-11-26T15:03:36  <mcstar> no, it will have networking and media players
2011-11-26T15:03:42  <p_l> actually, it's not even a new thing
2011-11-26T15:03:43  <mcstar> and a shiny control panel
2011-11-26T15:03:55  <Anilm3> nothing on windows is shiny
2011-11-26T15:04:01  <p_l> HTML+JS combo as executable app was available since... NT5.1?
2011-11-26T15:04:43  <p_l> so basically some extra APIs are now available in Win8, and you can pack it easily into apps distributable through Marketplace
2011-11-26T15:04:54  <p_l> nothing new there
2011-11-26T15:05:18  <Anilm3> that sucks
2011-11-26T15:05:55  <Anilm3> making dumb programmers dumber and the desktop even more heavy
2011-11-26T15:06:22  <thestinger> well, they want all applications to just be sandboxed web apps
2011-11-26T15:06:24  <thestinger> :P
2011-11-26T15:06:55  <p_l> wasn't that Apple try with iOS 1.0? ;P

2011-11-26T15:07:22  <mcstar> i just want a REAL terminal with a nice framebuffer to play videos
2011-11-26T15:07:23  <thestinger> iOS, Android and WP7 all sandbox apps
2011-11-26T15:07:38  <thestinger> all OSX apps on their mac app store have to be sandboxed now, they've set a deadline
2011-11-26T15:07:52  <thestinger> so if someone removes your program, _all_ the settings and stuff is wiped
2011-11-26T15:08:16  <avdg> they probably store it online ;-)
2011-11-26T15:08:26  <thestinger> a macbook air has no cdrom drive, and afaik they don't sell software on usb flash drives
2011-11-26T15:08:29  <avdg> as counter reaction
2011-11-26T15:08:49  <thestinger> so you have to buy stuff from their app store, or find the developer's site and buy it there
2011-11-26T15:09:16  <p_l> actually, Mac App store sandboxing seems to be rather worse than the competing ones
2011-11-26T15:09:16  <Raimondi> or use other mac cdrom drive, iirc
2011-11-26T15:10:05  <thestinger> well, you can buy an exterior optical drive
2011-11-26T15:10:14  <thestinger> I doubt many people are going to do that
2011-11-26T15:10:30  <thestinger> the Air also has no ethernet port
2011-11-26T15:10:37  <thestinger> you have to buy a usb to ethernet cable from them if you want one

2011-11-26T15:13:11  <thestinger> so different programs can have different permissions
2011-11-26T15:13:19  <thestinger> but apple has to approve your app and the permissions you need

2011-11-26T15:15:44  <p_l> thestinger: AppArmor is a very simplified MAC system. App Store sandboxing is all about "killing competition by removing features needed for serious applications"
2011-11-26T15:16:20  <p_l> cause quite possibly Apple's apps will continue being on App Store, despite being impossible to fit with their sandboxing privilige list

2011-11-26T15:25:55  <thestinger> oh
2011-11-26T15:26:02  <thestinger> so they wanted a 30% cut of amazon's revenue
2011-11-26T15:26:20  <thestinger> that's kind of insane :\
2011-11-26T15:27:02  <Minthos> it would make sense for them to negotiate a more reasonable cut with amazon directly
2011-11-26T15:27:03  <p_l> actually, what they wanted was to kill off anyone else distributing goods like Books etc. other than iBooks
2011-11-26T15:27:25  <p_l> so they made a rule that no retailer can agree and made it non-negotiable
2011-11-26T15:27:27  <thestinger> Minthos: they compete with Amazon though
2011-11-26T15:27:44  <thestinger> they sell books on itunes, amazon makes devices that compete with the ipad, etc.
2011-11-26T15:28:16  <Minthos> I would think some anti-monopoly laws would have something to say about that
2011-11-26T15:28:22  <thestinger> apple has good lawyers
2011-11-26T15:28:27  <thestinger> _lots_ of them
2011-11-26T15:28:46  <p_l> actually, what happens is that they in reality still have pitiful market share despite what they like to project
2011-11-26T15:29:02  <p_l> which protects them from anti-monopoly laws
2011-11-26T15:30:26  <Minthos> depends what you measure I think
2011-11-26T15:30:30  <thestinger> they're 2rd or 3rd in smartphone sales but they definitely own the tablet market
2011-11-26T15:30:40  <Minthos> they seem to have the smartphone app market cornered

2011-11-26T15:33:37  <p_l> also, unlike other devices, theirs are very noticeable
2011-11-26T15:34:35  <Minthos> but what are we counting here? the value of sold devices, or the value of sold apps for said devices?
2011-11-26T15:35:24  <p_l> Minthos: the statistic looked at by regulators would be amount of devices
2011-11-26T15:35:31  <thestinger> yeah, market share
2011-11-26T15:37:15  <thestinger> http://www.canalys.com/newsroom/htc-takes-lead-us-smart-phone-market
2011-11-26T15:37:25  <thestinger> so samsung has the highest market share atm
2011-11-26T15:37:34  <thestinger> I'm sure apple earns more profits than them by far though
2011-11-26T15:39:13  <p_l> thestinger: not really
2011-11-26T15:39:32  <p_l> thestinger: well, depends on how you calculate it

2011-11-26T15:40:08  <thestinger> they have much higher profit margins on each device
2011-11-26T15:40:24  <p_l> thestinger: yes, but for Samsung, smartphones aren't the only or one of the main profit sources...
2011-11-26T15:40:40  <p_l> and iirc, at least one subdivision got a cut of every older iPhone/iPod sold :)
2011-11-26T15:41:10  <p_l> (because samsung was a supplier)
2011-11-26T15:41:17  <thestinger> they still are
2011-11-26T15:41:57  <thestinger> I think they make most of the screens for the ipad/iphone

2011-11-26T15:43:34  <p_l> they certainly make screens for HTC

2011-11-26T16:30:48  <mcstar> turn that flag down
2011-11-26T16:30:48  <newant> now ull can start abusing me fr being an ass
2011-11-26T16:31:11  <Anilm3> what is "ull"?
2011-11-26T16:31:18  <mcstar> you all
2011-11-26T16:31:23  <newant> you all lol
2011-11-26T16:31:46  <mcstar> newant: why did you say you can execute c source?
2011-11-26T16:31:52  <thestinger> mcstar:
2011-11-26T16:31:54  <thestinger> strcat@arch i ~/projects/ai-challenge-bot % cint hello.cc
2011-11-26T16:31:56  <thestinger> Hello, world!
2011-11-26T16:32:05  <mcstar> thestinger: not your turn
2011-11-26T16:32:08  <Anilm3> because he has a C interpreter
2011-11-26T16:32:12  <mcstar> and that is interpretation
2011-11-26T16:32:26  <mcstar> but linux loader cant execute c source
2011-11-26T16:32:28  <newant> i thhought u meant i am on a windows without a compiler :-/
2011-11-26T16:32:42  <Anilm3> here you have one mcstar so you can be as cool as newant  http://code.google.com/p/picoc/
2011-11-26T16:33:50  <mcstar> Anilm3: dont tell me someone who cant compile c source will have a c interpreter installed?
2011-11-26T16:33:58  <mcstar> it is notimpossible but very imporbable
2011-11-26T16:34:48  <mcstar> newant: anyway, good luck
2011-11-26T16:35:02  <Anilm3> I want to see how his bot turns out
2011-11-26T16:35:09  <Anilm3> he may shut you up mcstar
2011-11-26T16:35:22  <Anilm3> be careful
2011-11-26T16:35:25  <mcstar> chances are even you could
2011-11-26T16:35:31  <Anilm3> chances are
2011-11-26T16:35:50  <thestinger> mcstar: anyway, I can just put a shebang in the C file :P
2011-11-26T16:35:53  <newant> thanks mcatar and anilm3 ok can you guys direct me to any tutorial that uses c rather than python as on the website
2011-11-26T16:36:10  <Antimony> if you know c, you shouldn't need a tutorial
2011-11-26T16:36:20  <newant> wats a shebang btw?
2011-11-26T16:36:32  <pairofdice> #!
2011-11-26T16:36:44  <mcstar> or hashbang
2011-11-26T16:37:08  <thestinger> #!/bin/rm
2011-11-26T16:37:11  <thestinger> is the best :)
2011-11-26T16:37:12  <newant> antimony its my first time trying to code so i cant really follow the python instruction much
2011-11-26T16:37:32  <Antimony> just learn python
2011-11-26T16:37:32  <mcstar> newant: you should have picked python then
2011-11-26T16:37:38  <Antimony> it's faster than trying to code in c
2011-11-26T16:37:42  <Antimony> if you're not experienced
2011-11-26T16:38:01  <newant> well i had learnt c before so i need to brush up
2011-11-26T16:38:17  <mcstar> "its my first time trying to code"
2011-11-26T16:38:23  <mcstar> how did you learn c wo actually coding?
2011-11-26T16:38:39  <Anilm3> mcstar: leave the guy, don't be the typical irc ass
2011-11-26T16:39:09  <Antimony> I'm just trying to be helpful
2011-11-26T16:39:23  <newant> it was just trying some basic stuff like addition functions and stuff nothing serious though
2011-11-26T16:39:39  <Antimony> Wow, I just figured out that due to a bug, I expand nodes multiple times in my BFS, leading to exopnential slowdown
2011-11-26T16:39:48  <Antimony> sicne it still gave the right answers, I never noticed
2011-11-26T16:40:00  <mcstar> how did you figure it out?
2011-11-26T16:40:04  <Antimony> if that's the extent of your experience, you're better off doing python
2011-11-26T16:40:16  <Antimony> what me?
2011-11-26T16:40:21  <mcstar> well, yes
2011-11-26T16:40:29  <Antimony> I was debugging an unrealted problem in a replay
2011-11-26T16:40:33  <mcstar> you said you never noticed
2011-11-26T16:40:42  <Antimony> then noticed that my code was taking too much time
2011-11-26T16:41:01  <newant> no antimaony i need to learn c well so i am going to stick to it do ull knw of any tutorials in c ?
2011-11-26T16:41:16  <thestinger> why do you need to learn C?
2011-11-26T16:41:23  <mcstar> newant: probably there are no c Ants tutorials
2011-11-26T16:41:29  <thestinger> it's going to be a _lot_ harder to learn a low-level language and use it for this
2011-11-26T16:41:32  <mcstar> its lucky you have python at al
2011-11-26T16:41:34  <mcstar> l
2011-11-26T16:42:19  <Antimony> I would have never noticed the bug, except for a combination of two other unrealted bugs, which led me to be debugging it anyway
2011-11-26T16:42:23  <mcstar> i guess hi is not in for the win
2011-11-26T16:42:32  <newant> i am tied up mentally right now to learn a new language i feel it will take much time which i dont hav
2011-11-26T16:42:33  <mcstar> so he could actually try to learn some c coding this
2011-11-26T16:42:51  <Antimony> it doesn't take long to learn python
2011-11-26T16:42:59  <newant> yes mcstar ur spot on
2011-11-26T16:43:05  <Antimony> and it will be faster than doing your bot in c
2011-11-26T16:43:17  <newant> i shall spare ur bots lol
2011-11-26T16:43:31  <mcstar> newant: then go ahead, but expect to spend much time on "utilities"
2011-11-26T16:43:58  <newant> "utilities" as in?
2011-11-26T16:43:58  <BenJackson> I just used a vector<pair<vector<Location>, vector<Location> > >
2011-11-26T16:44:11  <BenJackson> where in C I would have had to make up a whole new thing to store this
2011-11-26T16:44:18  <BenJackson> and if the idea didn't work that'd be a waste
2011-11-26T16:44:34  <Anilm3> haha yeah, c++ is great for this kind of stuff
2011-11-26T16:44:34  <mcstar> whoa
2011-11-26T16:45:33  <thestinger> making your own linked lists and dynamic arrays in C isn't that bad - but doing hash tables would be damn hard
2011-11-26T16:45:52  <BenJackson> not hard, just time consuming
2011-11-26T16:45:54  *** tdubellz is now known as jinglebellz
2011-11-26T16:45:56  <thestinger> and polymorphism in C is super painful
2011-11-26T16:46:13  <BenJackson> plus in C I'd never just do set<Location> foo.... foo.insert() / foo.count() just to try something out
2011-11-26T16:46:16  <Antimony> BenJackson, I just realized a combination of subtle bugs which prevented my bot from doing any combat at all on tcp
2011-11-26T16:46:17  <BenJackson> because I don't have a set
2011-11-26T16:46:23  <Antimony> hopefully it will be slightly better now
2011-11-26T16:47:20  <newant> ok guys thanks fr scaring the living daylights out of me
2011-11-26T16:47:50  <Anilm3> newant: don't worry dude
2011-11-26T16:48:02  <Anilm3> no one's expecting you to really beat mcstar
2011-11-26T16:48:30  <newant> lol ya but i never realised it wud b so hard to do it in c
2011-11-26T16:48:53  <Anilm3> for this kind of stuff it's better to avoid language complications
2011-11-26T16:49:00  <Anilm3> that's why I use C++
2011-11-26T16:49:27  <Antimony> I'm using C++ too, but it isn't easy
2011-11-26T16:49:34  <newant> do u require advanced c++ knowledge for this or will basic do?
2011-11-26T16:49:42  <Antimony> define advanced
2011-11-26T16:50:01  <mcstar> basic
2011-11-26T16:50:09  <mcstar> you dont really need oop
2011-11-26T16:50:23  <Antimony> Does anyone know wtf happened in this game? How did the other players each get 2 points? http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.16942
2011-11-26T16:50:24  <mcstar> only if you are comfortable in it or something
2011-11-26T16:50:58  <mcstar> Antimony: ???
2011-11-26T16:50:59  <newant> oh ok so then it shouldnt be much different from c then if its not oop should it?
2011-11-26T16:51:02  <mcstar> they razed hills?
2011-11-26T16:51:12  <Antimony> oh wait
2011-11-26T16:51:17  <Antimony> they razed each others hills
2011-11-26T16:51:19  <Anilm3> newant: c++ has other advantages
2011-11-26T16:51:19  <Antimony> ok that makes ense
2011-11-26T16:51:20  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-26T16:51:23  <mcstar> +1, +1
2011-11-26T16:51:27  <Anilm3> newant: you have the stl
2011-11-26T16:51:28  <Antimony> they razed each other on the exact same turn
2011-11-26T16:51:41  <Antimony> I got confused
2011-11-26T16:51:42  <BenJackson> wow
2011-11-26T16:51:47  <Minthos> newant: if you need to learn C, stay far away from C++ until you know C
2011-11-26T16:51:59  *** mj41 <mj41!~mj41_nby@80.82.144.206> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-26T16:52:02  <Minthos> newant: C++ is extremly complex, C is fairly simple
2011-11-26T16:52:12  <Antimony> but C++ is much nicer to code in
2011-11-26T16:52:24  <Minthos> only when you know it well
2011-11-26T16:52:30  <avdg> C can be complex as well ;-)
2011-11-26T16:52:38  <newant> oh ok i thought the two were much similar except for oop
2011-11-26T16:52:42  <mcstar> ok, he should use an alternative newant: try haskell
2011-11-26T16:52:43  <Antimony> no
2011-11-26T16:52:45  <Antimony> not at all
2011-11-26T16:52:53  <Antimony> C++ has cool stuff like templates and type safety
2011-11-26T16:53:02  <Antimony> and referneces
2011-11-26T16:53:05  <avdg> at least if you do memory management by hand (aka unsafe c)
2011-11-26T16:53:06  <Antimony> and RAII
2011-11-26T16:53:38  <Antimony> in fact, I've made entire games in C++ without using a single virtual function or exception
2011-11-26T16:53:45  <Antimony> and it's still a lot nicer than c
2011-11-26T16:54:06  <newant> mcstar dont confuse me more lol try haskell lmao
2011-11-26T16:54:14  <newant> u guys r gonna kill me!!!
2011-11-26T16:54:31  <Minthos> yes antimony but for someone who needs to learn C, C++ is just a lot more confusion and learning for no real gain
2011-11-26T16:54:52  <mcstar>  newant do you NEED to learn c or just "why not"
2011-11-26T16:54:57  <Antimony> But you can code C style in C++
2011-11-26T16:55:16  <Antimony> As a beginnner, I pretty much did c style, and then I learned more about idomatic C++ over time
2011-11-26T16:55:28  <Minthos> I know antimony, but when you do that and ask for help from C++ programmers, they will tell you to write C++, not C
2011-11-26T16:55:34  <Antimony> true
2011-11-26T16:56:45  <Minthos> newant: if you just want to learn something and have fun doing it, I suggest python for this ai challenge
2011-11-26T16:56:59  <Minthos> it gives a much more pleasant experience than C or C++
2011-11-26T16:57:20  <avdg> "if you just want to learn something and have fun doing it, just do what you want" ;-)
2011-11-26T16:57:43  <mcstar> dunno
2011-11-26T16:57:48  <Minthos> of course, but he came here asking for opinion and advice
2011-11-26T16:57:54  <Minthos> so I'm offering mine
2011-11-26T16:58:14  <mcstar> if you dont need c for some obscure reason, and you dont want to learna totally new language id say try coding in c++

2011-11-26T17:04:47  <newant> any suggestions where i can learn c++ from guys?
2011-11-26T17:04:56  <Anilm3> a book?
2011-11-26T17:04:59  <mcstar> newant: you dont have google?
2011-11-26T17:04:59  <pairofdice> C++ primer
2011-11-26T17:05:08  <mcstar> the internet is filled with garbage tutorials

2011-11-26T17:05:45  <newant> i need somethign begginer friendly

2011-11-26T17:06:24  <Anilm3> why don't you search google and look for something?
2011-11-26T17:06:31  <mcstar> he has a site, its nice
2011-11-26T17:06:33  <Antimony> I started learning C++ from cplusplus.com
2011-11-26T17:06:40  <mcstar> Antimony: thats a reference
2011-11-26T17:06:45  <Minthos> C++ isn't beginner friendly, so I doubt its documentation is
2011-11-26T17:06:47  <Antimony> It teaches basic syntax
2011-11-26T17:06:48  <mcstar> with many examples, true
2011-11-26T17:06:51  <thestinger> Antimony: but you knew how to program already didn't you?
2011-11-26T17:06:54  <Antimony> and it's useful refernece for stl

2011-11-26T17:07:03  <Antimony> before that I'd only done visual basic
2011-11-26T17:07:28  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp is better as a standard lib reference, because it's up to date
2011-11-26T17:07:34  <Antimony> after learning the basics, I learned a lot from reading gamedev.net
2011-11-26T17:08:12  <newant> hows thinking in c++ for starters?

2011-11-26T17:09:34  <Anilm3> that's handy
2011-11-26T17:09:56  <avdg> meh, I wish I could code much faster, so I could spend more time with optimizing :p
2011-11-26T17:10:22  <BenJackson> my curse is that my bot is successful but not because it's bug free..
2011-11-26T17:10:29  <newant> no but a little guidance is always better
2011-11-26T17:10:29  <Antimony> lol
2011-11-26T17:10:30  <BenJackson> I fix bugs, it often gets weaker...
2011-11-26T17:10:36  <BenJackson> blundering is not a bad strategy!
2011-11-26T17:10:53  <Antimony> One common bug for beginners that helps is a poor collision avoidance strategy
2011-11-26T17:10:57  <Antimony> because it leads to anticlustering
2011-11-26T17:11:03  <Antimony> which helps gathering and exploration
2011-11-26T17:11:04  <avdg> doing it wrong is also a tactic ;-)
2011-11-26T17:11:15  <Anilm3> yeah BenJackson I had that exact problem today

2011-11-26T17:22:36  <Antimony> have you done symmetry yet?
2011-11-26T17:22:39  <BenJackson> I wish the visualizer had a way to add elements to the timeline graph
2011-11-26T17:22:52  <Antimony> I'm about to start workign on it
2011-11-26T17:23:15  <BenJackson> Antimony: took me a few days of pondering to unravel the mysteries
2011-11-26T17:23:21  <BenJackson> and ultimately I haven't incorporated the results in my bot
2011-11-26T17:23:25  <BenJackson> so do with that what you will
2011-11-26T17:23:46  <Antimony> Well I've been thinking about it for a while but I haven't coded anything yet
2011-11-26T17:24:21  <BenJackson> I was about to resubmit and then I had to fix a performance bug because of these damn huge cell maps
2011-11-26T17:26:07  <janzert> grr, it's frustrating when people use the activation email to activate their account but then mark it as spam so that we get a spam complaint back to us
2011-11-26T17:26:33  <Antimony> wow, why would someone doe that?
2011-11-26T17:26:45  <BenJackson> people put my email into those things all the time
2011-11-26T17:26:52  <BenJackson> but I don't mark verification email spam
2011-11-26T17:27:01  <BenJackson> now if you just sign me up with no verification, hell yes it's spam
2011-11-26T17:28:00  <janzert> yeah, that's the frustrating pary, you know they understood what the email was for because they activated their account but then marked it as spam anyway
2011-11-26T17:31:10  <McLeopold> janzert: do you have time to discuss maps?

2011-11-26T17:51:39  <thestinger> ctypes is very nice to use, because you write normal C
2011-11-26T17:51:44  <thestinger> probably has overhead though
2011-11-26T17:52:03  <Fluxid> yeah, ctypes would work great with pypy though
2011-11-26T17:52:11  <McLeopold> 7?  there are 40 on official

2011-11-26T19:04:46  <BenJackson> wow xathis could fall from 1st
2011-11-26T19:07:47  <bqf> i really hope he does. not because i have anything against him, but because i'd really hate to see a bot from the beta phase win the challenge without anyone even coming close just because the beta phase was too long ;)

2011-11-26T19:19:05  <bqf> Fluxid: i did not mean to say "xathis stabilized his rank because the beta phase was too long". i meant "the beta phase was so long that a bot that was developed over several months has not been beaten in the official rankings even though the deadline is only three weeks away now and the contest has been running for quite a while"
2011-11-26T19:19:34  <_flag> Keep in mind too that a lot of players from the beta either dropped down or weren't even at the top when the contest began. There is an advantage, but overall you still have to have a really good understanding of the game

2011-11-26T20:58:10  <Yarr> because the compiler is giving problems on memcpy, ceil, sqrt and other functions like that
2011-11-26T20:58:30  <Yarr> string and math.h are included so i don't see why it doesn't compile
2011-11-26T21:00:39  <jbroman> Yarr: Add -lm to link against the math library.
2011-11-26T21:00:50  <jbroman> (To the linking command, specifically.)

2011-11-26T21:01:11  <Yarr> locally it's not a problem, it's the uploaded code that gives compiler errors
2011-11-26T21:01:37  <a1k0n> yeah.  string.h, stdlib.h, math.h, float.h (if you're using DBL_MAX or something like that)

2011-11-26T21:37:12  <roflmao> oh mighty kings of the ant universe, let me bestow you a gift to start a gift exchange cycle to bind you in reciprocating said gift, allowing me to improve my bot
2011-11-26T21:37:19  <a1k0n> sometimes it helps to disregard the minimax strategy and go in guns blazing
2011-11-26T21:37:27  <roflmao> so, here's 10 thousand brownie points to all of you, now tell me all your bot secrets, thanks.
2011-11-26T21:37:43  <_flag> a1k0n: If there's any good players in the game though you just end up losing :/
2011-11-26T21:37:44  <a1k0n> my bot's secret: pick moves randomly
2011-11-26T21:38:03  <_flag> Because you give up too much control of food spawns
2011-11-26T21:38:06  <a1k0n> yeah, depends who your opponent is
2011-11-26T21:38:27  <a1k0n> i leave just enough gatherers around to cover the map.  the problem is they have no backup and can be picked off easily
2011-11-26T21:38:35  <BenJackson> a1k0n: as on fluxid now on aichallenge
2011-11-26T21:38:48  <_flag> There's a lot of volitility in ants unfortunately
2011-11-26T21:38:48  <BenJackson> I think I'm jsut going to re-up to aichallenge
2011-11-26T21:38:53  <BenJackson> I'm not sure my new bot is better
2011-11-26T21:38:56  <BenJackson> but what the hell
2011-11-26T21:38:56  *** fpcfan <fpcfan!~vincent@80.123.225.55> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-26T21:39:22  <Antimony> Horaay, I think that once my new bot stablizes, I'll finally beat my friend!
2011-11-26T21:40:51  <a1k0n> i know my new bot (a1c1 variant) is ~1 trueskill point better than the one i've uploaded thanks to fluxid's server
2011-11-26T21:41:12  <a1k0n> probably not worth reupping
2011-11-26T21:41:48  <roflmao> would it be considered cheating to have a pre calculated database with millions of possible minimax combinations?
2011-11-26T21:41:54  <a1k0n> nope
2011-11-26T21:42:02  <a1k0n> if you can fit it in the size limit, go ahead
2011-11-26T21:42:13  <roflmao> would it be cheating to have it communicate across the web to my own server
2011-11-26T21:42:17  <a1k0n> yes
2011-11-26T21:42:23  <a1k0n> no sockets
2011-11-26T21:42:23  <roflmao> kk
2011-11-26T21:42:28  <BenJackson> my old bot will retire at 82.79
2011-11-26T21:42:35  <BenJackson> and hopefully the new one will play instantly
2011-11-26T21:42:37  <_flag> Mainserver rankings aren't very useful, pguillory submitted his last bot two weeks ago and only now is it about to pass xathis
2011-11-26T21:42:43  <bmh> I wish I hadn't decided to use haskell.
2011-11-26T21:42:51  <_flag> So you won't get any really good information from reupping anyway
2011-11-26T21:42:53  <BenJackson> hahaha it did
2011-11-26T21:42:56  <a1k0n> bmh: you can change your mind
2011-11-26T21:43:06  <BenJackson> ok everyone who was >19 you are now ranked 1 higher :)
2011-11-26T21:43:15  <a1k0n> haha nice
2011-11-26T21:43:16  <bmh> a1k0n: want to rip the important parts of your bot out and release a new C++ starter? :)
2011-11-26T21:43:21  <a1k0n> good job beating byteAnt
2011-11-26T21:44:04  <BenJackson> thanks
2011-11-26T21:44:14  <Zao> bmh: How's the build infrastructure? Do you have anything from Hackage?
2011-11-26T21:44:20  <BenJackson> it'd be hard to write a starter and not start putting featuers in it
2011-11-26T21:44:25  <Zao> Or do you have to pack everything in your own package?
2011-11-26T21:44:29  <bmh> Zao: I manually pulled in the libraries I needed
2011-11-26T21:44:35  <BenJackson> Rank: 6983
2011-11-26T21:44:41  <BenJackson> I had no idea how many accounts there were now
2011-11-26T21:44:55  <BenJackson> of course I played 2464 which appeared to be a starter kit
2011-11-26T21:45:37  <BenJackson> mm, maybe not, it made one move when it saw food

2011-11-26T22:01:28  <Yarr> is there a way to find out more about how your bot failed the test after uploading?
2011-11-26T22:01:41  <Yarr> it passes the test fine, regardless of compiler
2011-11-26T22:01:48  <Yarr> locally that is
2011-11-26T22:01:55  <Yarr> on the server i get a timeout
2011-11-26T22:02:36  <pairofdice> With python it puts traceback in my profile

2011-11-26T22:03:33  <Yarr> using c++ here, would i get things i write to cerr?
2011-11-26T22:04:07  <avdg> give me the error
2011-11-26T22:04:21  <avdg> did you include iostream?
2011-11-26T22:05:02  <Yarr> it compiles fine now, but it timeouts on the post-compile test
2011-11-26T22:05:14  <avdg> hmm
2011-11-26T22:05:17  <Yarr> don't think it's THAT heavy a setup procedure though
2011-11-26T22:05:35  <avdg> maybe you didn't trigger the "go" event
2011-11-26T22:05:45  *** fpcfan <fpcfan!~vincent@80.123.225.55> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2011-11-26T22:05:54  <Antimony> timeouts are a pain to debug
2011-11-26T22:06:11  <Antimony> are you sure it didn't timeout at all when running it on local computer?
2011-11-26T22:06:14  <avdg> manual or costum runs :-)
2011-11-26T22:06:35  <pairofdice> Does it run locally
2011-11-26T22:06:42  <Yarr> everything works fine on my end, using the play_one_game script
2011-11-26T22:06:45  <avdg> (create a fake bot, which passes fake information, if the timeout happens, you know you should blame the core)
2011-11-26T22:07:03  <Antimony> try running it on tcp

2011-11-26T22:07:32  <Yarr> what do you mean by that?
2011-11-26T22:08:26  <avdg> you just run a bot in a know situation at both sides, the runner and the bot gives recorder information
2011-11-26T22:08:39  <avdg> so you can test how stable your core is
2011-11-26T22:09:28  *** fpcfan <fpcfan!~vincent@80.123.225.55> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-26T22:10:17  <Yarr> by which you mean how predictable my program is, right? (first bot i'm uploading so i don't know the aichallenge-lingo yet)
2011-11-26T22:10:40  <Yarr> predictable as in running times and such
2011-11-26T22:12:51  <Yarr> screw it, it's 4am, i'll continue in tomorrow, or try to run it on some uni computers to see if linux/slower computer makes any difference
2011-11-26T22:13:00  <Yarr> thanks for helping
2011-11-26T22:13:07  <Yarr> cya later perhaps
