2012-01-02T03:19:06  <lahwran> how is code run safely on the servers?
2012-01-02T03:19:21  <lahwran> ie, the aichallenge system accepts untrusted code - how does it ensure execution safety?
2012-01-02T03:19:43  <lahwran> amstan: poke, I'm told you might know
2012-01-02T03:20:28  <amstan> lahwran: see worker/
2012-01-02T03:20:35  <amstan> lahwran: there's a ton of code about sandboxing in there
2012-01-02T03:20:42  <lahwran> worker/ in what?
2012-01-02T03:20:46  <amstan> @repo
2012-01-02T03:20:47  <contestbot> amstan: repo could be https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge.
2012-01-02T03:20:53  <lahwran> alrighty
2012-01-02T03:21:18  <lahwran> amstan: where's the entry point in worker/?
2012-01-02T03:21:44  <amstan> worker.py
2012-01-02T03:21:48  <amstan> but that's fairly high level
2012-01-02T03:21:57  <lahwran> alright, thanks

2012-01-02T03:22:35  <amstan> it goes something like this, might not be correct: worker.py>engine(also uses ants)>sandbox>yourbot
2012-01-02T03:22:57  <amstan> compiler.py also gets used somewhere in there
2012-01-02T03:23:14  <amstan> we might also be refactoring all of this for the next contest
2012-01-02T03:23:18  <amstan> but that's what was used for ants
2012-01-02T03:23:46  <amstan> for specific stuff ask janzert/mcleopold
2012-01-02T03:23:55  <lahwran> ah, so it's not virtualization-based
2012-01-02T03:24:03  <amstan> no
2012-01-02T03:24:11  <amstan> we didn't want to do that because it would be kinda slow
2012-01-02T03:24:17  <amstan> and we're already virtualized by ec2
2012-01-02T03:24:28  <lahwran> were there any issues with people breaking out of the sandbox?
2012-01-02T03:24:36  <amstan> not that we know of
2012-01-02T03:24:57  <lahwran> interesting
2012-01-02T03:25:53  <lahwran> how fast was startup/teardown of the sandbox? insignificant? second or two?
2012-01-02T03:26:07  <amstan> it was fairly fast
2012-01-02T03:26:25  <amstan> you can play with all of this btw, if you have an ubuntu vm handy
2012-01-02T03:26:36  <lahwran> I'm on ubuntu natively
2012-01-02T03:26:58  <amstan> yeah, but this stuff takes over your system, you should get another install
2012-01-02T03:27:01  <lahwran> ah
2012-01-02T03:27:14  <lahwran> I've been hacking on the pypy sandbox lately, got it down to about a half second total runtime on an empty script

2012-01-02T03:28:33  <antimatroid> i saw someone saying something about writing something in c++ next time for speed
2012-01-02T03:28:39  <antimatroid> maybe just the game engines
2012-01-02T03:29:03  <amstan> the only issues we had with speed was mysql
2012-01-02T03:29:24  <amstan> anything else was relatively fast
2012-01-02T03:29:44  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2012-01-02T03:30:04  <antimatroid> i'm going to try and learn more about the backend stuff in the next few montsh
2012-01-02T03:30:15  <antimatroid> and how to actually use tools :P

2012-01-02T07:46:45  <mcstar> the important part is the nextPerm function
2012-01-02T07:46:54  <mcstar> the other functions just drive this
2012-01-02T07:47:26  <mcstar> it generates the next lexicographic permutation of a list with orderable elements

2012-01-02T07:55:37  <UncleVasya> no, I'm too stupid for this.
2012-01-02T07:56:49  <mcstar> :(
2012-01-02T07:56:51  <mcstar> youre not
2012-01-02T07:57:27  <mcstar> it would be more than easy to do it in a mutable way
2012-01-02T07:57:48  <UncleVasya> really, if you look in my code yo'll see that there are no data structures and algoritms.
2012-01-02T07:57:49  <mcstar> but in haskell, doing it purely functinally, its a PITA
2012-01-02T07:58:27  <UncleVasya> In fact, there are only 2 algoritmic things: buuble sort that I found in Google
2012-01-02T07:58:53  <UncleVasya> and BFS --> that I coded by myself for the first time (and very proud :D)
2012-01-02T07:59:38  <mcstar> you are a peculiar guy
2012-01-02T08:00:01  <mcstar> you said there are no algorithms, yet you cite 2 important ones
2012-01-02T08:00:16  <mcstar> you say no data structures, but i bet there are lists and arrays
2012-01-02T08:01:08  <mcstar> anyway, if you think you are "too stupid for this" then pls try doing it
2012-01-02T08:01:29  <UncleVasya> I meant developed by myself
2012-01-02T08:01:30  <mcstar> id be interested in your solution, i know you can do it, the algorithm is simple
2012-01-02T08:01:52  <UncleVasya> If I'd need to write my own list implementation --> I can't do it
2012-01-02T08:02:12  <UncleVasya> ok, I'll try
2012-01-02T08:02:33  <mcstar> a list just needs a contructor, and the representation for the empty list, i.e. another constructor
2012-01-02T08:02:35  <UncleVasya> When I'll be at home (4+ hours)
2012-01-02T08:02:47  <mcstar> ok
2012-01-02T08:03:08  <mcstar> pls, try to do it wo mutation ok?
2012-01-02T08:03:18  <UncleVasya> I'll read about algorithm, I'll find c++ implementation and will base my work on it.
2012-01-02T08:03:35  <UncleVasya> Or you need that haskell implementation to be translated?
2012-01-02T08:03:42  <mcstar> no
2012-01-02T08:03:45  <mcstar> write your own
2012-01-02T08:03:50  <mcstar> but not mutate state
2012-01-02T08:03:57  <mcstar> not->dont
2012-01-02T08:04:19  <mcstar> so pls dont "translate" the c version to ocaml
2012-01-02T08:04:22  <mcstar> thats pointless
2012-01-02T08:04:42  <UncleVasya> ok, my instrumentary will be only articles about algorithm and Geany :)
2012-01-02T08:05:17  <mcstar> btw, probably this is the algorithm behind c++ stl's next_permutation function
2012-01-02T08:05:30  <mcstar> (or a very similar one)

2012-01-02T11:33:20  <jmcarthur> there seems to be a lot of suggestions in the forums
2012-01-02T11:33:23  <jmcarthur> mcstar: yeah
2012-01-02T11:34:07  <mcstar> i recently read articles from some minsky guy that works there, and i get the impression they use ocaml, but i saw no mention of haskell
2012-01-02T11:34:15  <jmcarthur> yeah it's ocaml
2012-01-02T11:34:22  <mcstar> but you said you do haskell at work

2012-01-02T11:34:53  <mcstar> ok, my mind went wild there apparently
2012-01-02T11:35:30  <mcstar> we were talking about haskell, and jane street, and you didnt mention ocaml at all
2012-01-02T11:35:36  <mcstar> maybe thats why i thought that..
2012-01-02T11:35:50  <jmcarthur> heh, i don't remember at all. sorry for the confusion, nonetheless
2012-01-02T11:36:25  <jmcarthur> there are several haskell programmers at jane street. it's just not what we actually use there
2012-01-02T11:36:46  <mcstar> i wrote some very ugly haskell code using the SEPA algorithm
2012-01-02T11:36:50  <jmcarthur> but at least it's ocaml and not c++ ;)
2012-01-02T11:37:04  * jmcarthur looks up SEPA
2012-01-02T11:37:36  <mcstar> it is for computing the next lexicographic permutation of a list
2012-01-02T11:38:05  <mcstar> i wonder how one would do that in a purely functinal way
2012-01-02T11:38:08  <jmcarthur> what state does it need?
2012-01-02T11:38:21  <mcstar> it can be considered a pure function
2012-01-02T11:38:48  <jmcarthur> oh i see
2012-01-02T11:38:50  <mcstar> but actually writing the alg. is horrible
2012-01-02T11:38:54  <mcstar> at least for me
2012-01-02T11:39:09  <mcstar> i have a clue, that Zippers might come handy
2012-01-02T11:39:22  <mcstar> but i havent really comprehended them to use them

2012-01-02T11:40:31  <jmcarthur> this algorithm seems to affect large portions of the string in each step
2012-01-02T11:40:37  <jmcarthur> but i don't know, really
2012-01-02T11:40:46  <jmcarthur> s/string/list/
2012-01-02T11:40:47  <mcstar> whats your source?
2012-01-02T11:40:49  <mcstar> ah ok
2012-01-02T11:41:03  <mcstar> i proceeded along the first google hit
2012-01-02T11:41:28  <mcstar> it requires 3 pass at the list
2012-01-02T11:41:50  <mcstar> 1 from the END to search for a a,b|a<b condition -> a
2012-01-02T11:42:11  <mcstar> after that search in the tail from a -> right to the end
2012-01-02T11:42:17  <jmcarthur> i hate it when algorithms are presented in such an imperative way
2012-01-02T11:42:28  <mcstar> for b > a but min b
2012-01-02T11:42:38  <mcstar> and after that a swap and reverse
2012-01-02T11:42:58  <mcstar> jmcarthur: i have an implementation, but it was a great deal of pita to write it
2012-01-02T11:43:08  <jmcarthur> it would help if i actually understood *why* this algorithm works
2012-01-02T11:43:53  <mcstar> it is similar to the alg. that humans use when you write the lexicographi permutations
2012-01-02T11:43:59  <mcstar> not the same
2012-01-02T11:44:14  <mcstar> because we think about all the permutations that came before the current one
2012-01-02T11:44:27  <mcstar> but this only needs 1 state to derive the next
2012-01-02T11:44:47  <mcstar> jmcarthur: http://codepad.org/prXLnKQk
2012-01-02T11:45:04  <mcstar> the nextPerm function is the relevant part
2012-01-02T11:45:07  <jmcarthur> okay i think i get it based on reading this http://www.freewebs.com/permute/soda_submit.html
2012-01-02T11:45:13  <jmcarthur> doesn't seem too bad. i'll give this a shot
2012-01-02T11:45:21  <mcstar> great :)

2012-01-02T11:48:10  <mcstar> it shouldnt not travel the list unncessarily, and i should be able to read your code
2012-01-02T11:48:19  <jmcarthur> oh n/m

2012-01-02T11:48:25  <mcstar> O
2012-01-02T11:49:07  <jmcarthur> hmm... to get an algorithm like that i will have to be clever indeed
2012-01-02T11:49:30  <jmcarthur> well. not *too* clever i guess
2012-01-02T11:54:52  <mcstar> on a sidenote, this algorithm appealed to me cause it permutes possibly identical elements correctly

2012-01-02T12:13:38  <jmcarthur> eh
2012-01-02T12:13:48  <jmcarthur> i'm going with Data.Sequence for now
2012-01-02T12:13:58  <mcstar> is that mutable?
2012-01-02T12:14:01  <jmcarthur> no
2012-01-02T12:14:17  <mcstar> i forgot, what's its trick?

2012-01-02T12:14:46  <jmcarthur> constant time access to the ends, log time split and concat

2012-01-02T12:15:30  <jmcarthur> i actually considered going with the fingertree package and making my own measure and everything
2012-01-02T12:16:01  <jmcarthur> would actually have some asymptotic improvements over the original algorithm if i did it right. but only if you look at a particular step or two. the overall runtime would still be O(n)
2012-01-02T12:16:01  <mcstar> have you seen my code?
2012-01-02T12:16:12  <jmcarthur> i'm avoiding looking at your code, but i did see its overall structure
2012-01-02T12:16:34  <mcstar> i reverse the input list when i get it, and again before returning it
2012-01-02T12:16:50  <mcstar> im wondering if it could be done without those 2 reverses using only lists
2012-01-02T12:17:29  <jmcarthur> i don't think so. even translating to a zipper would have about the same effect
2012-01-02T12:17:55  <jmcarthur> the problem is using lists at all, i think
2012-01-02T12:17:56  <mcstar> i think it possible could be done, but that would not be tali recursive
2012-01-02T12:18:05  <jmcarthur> maybe i should just write an array algorithm
2012-01-02T12:18:17  <jmcarthur> tail recursion is overrated
2012-01-02T12:18:20  <jmcarthur> at least in haskell
2012-01-02T12:18:43  <jmcarthur> in haskell you often *don't* want tail recursion
2012-01-02T12:19:15  <jmcarthur> you have quite a few uses of reverse. i think that number could almost certainly be lowered
2012-01-02T12:19:24  <mcstar> 4
2012-01-02T12:19:32  <mcstar> but those other 2 are not on the whole list
2012-01-02T12:19:49  <mcstar> and yeah, it could be simpkler
2012-01-02T12:19:53  <mcstar> i just couldnt do it
2012-01-02T12:19:59  <mcstar> it was hard to write this as it is
2012-01-02T12:21:15  <jmcarthur> (reverse $ (reverse acc) ++ [v] ++ xs) ++ [x]   ==>   reverse xs ++ [v] ++ acc ++ [x]

2012-01-02T12:39:58  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah, I have trouble coding certain things in haskell without a lot of pain
2012-01-02T12:40:10  <thestinger> because the algorithms are presented as an imperative procedure
2012-01-02T12:40:31  <thestinger> whenever you have to use ++ everywhere something is wrong, because that has to walk through the whole first list to find the end
2012-01-02T12:40:57  <thestinger> maybe ghc optimizes more than I think it does
2012-01-02T12:41:15  <jmcarthur> thestinger: nah, that's going to be fairly inefficient anyway
2012-01-02T12:41:17  <mcstar> i know
2012-01-02T12:41:24  <mcstar> i try : whenerver i can
2012-01-02T12:41:32  <mcstar> but sometimes i have to concatenate lists
2012-01-02T12:41:58  <jmcarthur> mcstar: sorry, but i'm getting bored with this and am not finding any *especially* nice purely functional formulations
2012-01-02T12:42:14  <jmcarthur> i still think Data.Sequence or Data.Vector are going to be the best bets
2012-01-02T12:42:24  <jmcarthur> (probably Data.Vector)
2012-01-02T12:42:42  <mcstar> hm
2012-01-02T12:43:08  <mcstar> anything you write would be appreciated, cause it would be more readbale than mine
2012-01-02T12:43:45  <mcstar> that alg. is a keep for me cause its very useful
2012-01-02T12:44:02  <jmcarthur> i'll give it a go some other time perhaps
2012-01-02T12:44:08  <jmcarthur> i'm going to have to leave soon anyway
2012-01-02T12:44:11  <mcstar> permutation from Data.List doesnt give the "right" answer
2012-01-02T12:44:27  <mcstar> jmcarthur: ok, thx for the attention :)
2012-01-02T12:45:05  <jmcarthur> there's always (sort . permutations) ;)
2012-01-02T12:49:22  <jmcarthur> mcstar: why do you want this algorithm anyway?
2012-01-02T12:49:48  <mcstar> i want it tattood on my butt
2012-01-02T12:49:53  <mcstar> :D
2012-01-02T12:49:58  <jmcarthur> o_O
2012-01-02T12:50:11  <mcstar> no particular reason
2012-01-02T12:50:18  <mcstar> it might come handy for some PE problem
2012-01-02T12:50:22  <jmcarthur> but seriously, if you intend to generate all permutations at some point then i bet this isn't a very efficient way to go about it
2012-01-02T12:50:51  <mcstar> i think it is efficient
2012-01-02T12:51:07  <mcstar> and the author argues that is is
2012-01-02T12:51:09  <mcstar> it*
2012-01-02T12:51:36  <jmcarthur> i believe it is an efficient way to compute the next permutation given no other information
2012-01-02T12:51:52  <jmcarthur> but that doesn't necessarily mean it is going to be as efficient as a stateful permutation generator
2012-01-02T12:52:00  <mcstar> i wanted a non-recursive alg. that can deal with identical elements in the list, as i said previously
2012-01-02T12:52:54  <jmcarthur> what do you mean to deal with identical elements?
2012-01-02T12:53:05  <jmcarthur> you mean to not generate identical permutations?
2012-01-02T12:53:18  <mcstar> you know the c++'s next_permutation function? in behcmarks that beat all my permutation algorithsm as far as i recakk
2012-01-02T12:53:20  <mcstar> recall*
2012-01-02T12:53:26  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-02T12:53:31  <mcstar> [1,1,2]
2012-01-02T12:53:34  <mcstar> [1,2,1]
2012-01-02T12:53:37  <mcstar> [2,1,1]
2012-01-02T12:53:54  <jmcarthur> i see
2012-01-02T12:54:35  <jmcarthur> okay, with that requirement i can see this being more efficient than a more common permutation generator
2012-01-02T12:55:00  <jmcarthur> assuming there are a lot of duplicate elements
2012-01-02T12:55:09  <mcstar> in my last case there were
2012-01-02T12:55:23  <mcstar> N_a times a, N_b times b
2012-01-02T12:55:28  <ahow984_> so what do people want for the next aichallenge?
2012-01-02T12:56:13  <jmcarthur> a fun game
2012-01-02T12:56:18  <mcstar> we dont really think about it i think
2012-01-02T12:56:20  *** Kingpin13 <Kingpin13!~Kingpin13@Wikipedia/Kingpin13> has joined #aichallenge
2012-01-02T12:56:30  <jmcarthur> we don't?
2012-01-02T12:56:33  <mcstar> those who press this issue didnt participate in the challenge
2012-01-02T12:56:47  <UncleVasya> some people want to have a rest between them :)
2012-01-02T12:56:47  *** smjms <smjms!~janne@dsl-roibrasgw1-fe97fb00-191.dhcp.inet.fi> has joined #aichallenge
2012-01-02T12:57:08  <ahow984_> mcstar: what do you mean?
2012-01-02T12:57:19  <mcstar> did you submit a bot?
2012-01-02T12:57:23  <ahow984_> yes
2012-01-02T12:57:28  <mcstar> oh
2012-01-02T12:57:30  <ahow984_> I didn't do well but I did enter
2012-01-02T12:57:31  <ahow984_> :P
2012-01-02T12:57:34  <mcstar> :)
2012-01-02T12:57:56  <UncleVasya> And you've found this challenge too late, right?
2012-01-02T12:58:55  <jmcarthur> i ended up not participating in ants because i didn't think the game was all that interesting
2012-01-02T12:59:29  <mcstar> i hope you know you were wrong
2012-01-02T12:59:51  <mcstar> or do you still think so?
2012-01-02T12:59:57  <jmcarthur> i hope i was indeed wrong
2012-01-02T13:01:23  <jmcarthur> it seemed like most of the code i was writing was just to make a bot that could basically play the game without being stupid before i could get around to coming up with truly interesting AI
2012-01-02T13:02:10  <mcstar> noone can come up with an AI in 2 months
2012-01-02T13:02:15  <jmcarthur> i regret that i pushed so hard for fog of war, for one
2012-01-02T13:02:32  <jmcarthur> the game was complex enough without it, it turns out
2012-01-02T13:02:44  *** treeform <treeform!~treeform@c-69-181-52-73.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2012-01-02T13:03:28  <mcstar> fow prohibits an optimal solution
2012-01-02T13:03:38  <mcstar> i dont think its particularly bad...
2012-01-02T13:03:45  <jmcarthur> i don't think there is a feasible optimal solution even without fow
2012-01-02T13:04:03  <jmcarthur> don't get me wrong, i think the fog of war aspect made it more interesting, but for a big price in terms of complexity
2012-01-02T13:04:20  <mcstar> you can plan on global strategy then, just like you do in micro-battles
2012-01-02T13:04:35  <jmcarthur> i think that's a good thing
2012-01-02T13:04:54  <jmcarthur> it means more intelligence
2012-01-02T13:04:55  <mcstar> i prefer this
2012-01-02T13:05:02  <ahow984_> UncleVasya: no, I didn't have enough time for it. my bot took about 30 hours in total time to make
2012-01-02T13:05:33  <ahow984_> sorry
2012-01-02T13:05:42  <jmcarthur> i'm curious how well a game could work that's based loosely on Diplomacy
2012-01-02T13:05:47  <ahow984_> my nick I used when I came here was conor_f mcstar
2012-01-02T13:05:52  <UncleVasya> that's exactly what mcstar means.
2012-01-02T13:05:59  <ahow984_> maybe thats why you didn't recognize me?
2012-01-02T13:06:09  <mcstar> ahow984_: certainly
2012-01-02T13:06:30  <ahow984_> you remember helping the noob me with bfs? ;)
2012-01-02T13:06:38  <mcstar> but the irish accent should indicate thats you
2012-01-02T13:06:49  <jmcarthur> a simple map where the result of attacking a territory depends solely on numbers and you have to communicate with the other players to decide who to attack
2012-01-02T13:07:03  <ahow984_> mcstar: damn, my accent couldn't show through just words? :P
2012-01-02T13:07:32  <jmcarthur> the three interesting things would be who to attack, how to communicate, and how to establish trust
2012-01-02T13:07:35  <thestinger> ahow984_: oh... you're conor_f :)
2012-01-02T13:07:53  <ahow984_> yup, maybe it was you who thought me bfs....
2012-01-02T13:07:55  <ahow984_> in Java?
2012-01-02T13:08:08  <thestinger> I think I helped you with something
2012-01-02T13:08:11  <thestinger> don't remember what
2012-01-02T13:08:14  <mcstar> i think i did too
2012-01-02T13:08:17  <mcstar> XD
2012-01-02T13:08:22  <ahow984_> I wouldn't be surprised ;)
2012-01-02T13:08:33  <ahow984_> most people probably helped me out with bits lol
2012-01-02T13:08:53  <UncleVasya> jmcarthur: I think I have an answer for 2nd and 3rd questions
2012-01-02T13:09:06  <UncleVasya> For any game:
2012-01-02T13:09:56  <mcstar> jmcarthur: sounds interesting, resembles babylon 5 to me
2012-01-02T13:11:18  <UncleVasya> Player A can make an _advice_ to any other player. Advice is the usual order but to enemy player's forces.
2012-01-02T13:12:09  <ahow984_> I thought that football game was cool :)
2012-01-02T13:12:20  <UncleVasya> Also when Player A issues orders for his own forces he can mark some of them as 'i do it because of advice of player N'.
2012-01-02T13:12:36  <jmcarthur> Would also be nice to be able to tell other players what moves you plan to make, even if it's a lie.
2012-01-02T13:12:38  <mcstar> ahow984_: i think it has more room for strategy and such than a multi player asteroid game
2012-01-02T13:12:47  <mcstar> but i appreciate aerique's efforts
2012-01-02T13:12:59  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-02T13:13:00  <mcstar> c.f. haxball
2012-01-02T13:13:05  <jmcarthur> how would marking the moves that way be helpful?
2012-01-02T13:13:08  <ahow984_> yeah, that was the one
2012-01-02T13:13:09  <UncleVasya> All players get info about moves they see: was it made by advice or not.
2012-01-02T13:13:16  <jmcarthur> ah
2012-01-02T13:13:21  *** epicmonkey <epicmonkey!~epicmonke@188.134.41.210> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2012-01-02T13:13:24  <ahow984_> mcstar: sorry, what did aerique do?
2012-01-02T13:13:35  <mcstar> a mock up
2012-01-02T13:13:45  <mcstar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqfH5J18C30
2012-01-02T13:13:55  <jmcarthur> i think it might be more interesting to leave the communication protocol out of the spec and see what emerges in the forums and such
2012-01-02T13:14:10  <ahow984_> mcstar: thats interesting
2012-01-02T13:14:17  <ahow984_> I still prefer haxball though ;)
2012-01-02T13:14:21  <pairofdice> And see the participation plummet
2012-01-02T13:14:27  <jmcarthur> possibly
2012-01-02T13:14:38  <UncleVasya> there will be a lot of protocols for every group of friends :)
2012-01-02T13:14:39  <jmcarthur> i haven't thought it through
2012-01-02T13:14:49  <jmcarthur> i think it would standardize pretty quickly
2012-01-02T13:15:25  <jmcarthur> to a few different protocols maybe, but then most bots will need to speak all of them and it should collapse down to just one eventually
2012-01-02T13:15:32  <jmcarthur> maybe that's annoying
2012-01-02T13:15:33  <ahow984_> I personally don't think the communication would work so well....
2012-01-02T13:15:46  <jmcarthur> okay, i think it should be in the spec now
2012-01-02T13:15:50  <mcstar> I personally don't think the communication protocoll is relevant at all
2012-01-02T13:16:10  <jmcarthur> well, it would be nice to be able to express *why* you want opponents to make certain moves and stuff
2012-01-02T13:16:27  <pairofdice> ugh, politics
2012-01-02T13:16:31  <ahow984_> haha
2012-01-02T13:16:39  <ahow984_> pairofdice: :)
2012-01-02T13:16:45  <mcstar> the perfect next game must have a similar component to Ants' battle resolution
2012-01-02T13:16:50  <jmcarthur> but i guess you could just tell them all the moves you hope to see on the next turn
2012-01-02T13:16:54  <jmcarthur> from all players
2012-01-02T13:17:08  <jmcarthur> possibly giving different views of the next turn to different players in an attempt to deceive
2012-01-02T13:17:22  <jmcarthur> then there could be a few iterations of communication, and then a turn
2012-01-02T13:17:34  *** epicmonkey <epicmonkey!~epicmonke@188.134.41.210> has joined #aichallenge
2012-01-02T13:17:34  <ahow984_> mcstar: what about a game of search and destroy?
2012-01-02T13:18:30  <mcstar> im not familiar with it
2012-01-02T13:18:48  <ahow984_> well its not a game really, more like a game mode in fps games
2012-01-02T13:19:03  <ahow984_> but the concept is you search for opponents and destroy them
2012-01-02T13:19:07  <mcstar> an fps is pretty much out of the question
2012-01-02T13:19:17  <mcstar> (i wanted one thought)
2012-01-02T13:19:19  <ahow984_> just taking the concept
2012-01-02T13:19:20  <jmcarthur> like battleship?
2012-01-02T13:19:24  <ahow984_> no
2012-01-02T13:19:26  <UncleVasya> maybe divide turn into 2 parts: 1. communicating between bots (trading like 'I do move A if you do moves B and C') and 2. issuing orders?
2012-01-02T13:19:37  <ahow984_> you have a maze of some description
2012-01-02T13:19:39  <ahow984_> and players
2012-01-02T13:19:40  <jmcarthur> UncleVasya: that's the basic idea
2012-01-02T13:19:51  <ahow984_> and you have to search for other players and destroy them
2012-01-02T13:20:04  <ahow984_> very similar to ants without the hills and multiple ants
2012-01-02T13:20:06  <mcstar> sounds like ants in a maze
2012-01-02T13:20:13  <pairofdice> Yeah, too similar
2012-01-02T13:20:16  <ahow984_> maybe CTF?
2012-01-02T13:20:19  <jmcarthur> UncleVasya: the expressivity of the communication protocol would be important i think
2012-01-02T13:20:19  <mcstar> :(
2012-01-02T13:20:28  <pairofdice> CTF, you mean , capture the anthill?
2012-01-02T13:20:31  <ahow984_> a set number of people on a team try to take over someones base?
2012-01-02T13:20:42  <mcstar> you brinf the "hill" back to your hill
2012-01-02T13:20:43  <pairofdice> Still too similar
2012-01-02T13:20:44  <ahow984_> haha, it sounds very like that I suppose :/
2012-01-02T13:20:48  <mcstar> :)
2012-01-02T13:21:04  <jmcarthur> each message could be something like   [Hope | Expect] <player> <move>
2012-01-02T13:21:16  <pairofdice> I liked to idea of xpilot'ish
2012-01-02T13:21:25  <jmcarthur> "i hope player 2 does this move, but i expect this one"
2012-01-02T13:21:29  <jmcarthur> etc.
2012-01-02T13:21:55  <ahow984_> pairofdice: yesh, but it doesn't seem to give much scope for intelligence
2012-01-02T13:22:14  <mcstar> data Maybe a = Hope a | Expect a | Nothing
2012-01-02T13:22:50  <ahow984_> seems to be just an avoidance function and a function to search for ships in range and then shoot....
2012-01-02T13:22:53  <jmcarthur> of course you can always make it even more expressive
2012-01-02T13:23:15  <jmcarthur> expectation given as a probability distribution, for example
2012-01-02T13:23:22  <jmcarthur> not sure how useful that is
2012-01-02T13:24:12  <jmcarthur> with a few rounds of communication you could try to deceive one player into making a bad move and then tell that information to other players so everybody can capitalize on it
2012-01-02T13:24:17  <ahow984_> It would just end up people blocking all communication and just going themselves
2012-01-02T13:24:20  <jmcarthur> maybe even requiring some cooperation for the deception
2012-01-02T13:24:23  <ahow984_> thats what I'd do anyways....
2012-01-02T13:24:32  <jmcarthur> you'd lose first, i promise
2012-01-02T13:24:37  <jmcarthur> the other would just gang up on you
2012-01-02T13:24:39  <jmcarthur> *others
2012-01-02T13:24:41  <ahow984_> haha, yeah
2012-01-02T13:24:42  <ahow984_> suppose
2012-01-02T13:24:53  <ahow984_> still, if you have 5 players
2012-01-02T13:25:08  <ahow984_> actually, never mind :p
2012-01-02T13:25:46  <jmcarthur> so anyway, if you manage to convince a player to do something stupid you can then express your expectation of what that player will do in later iterations of the communcation
2012-01-02T13:25:59  <jmcarthur> *communication
2012-01-02T13:26:32  <ahow984_> jmcarthur: seems very complicated....
2012-01-02T13:26:44  <pairofdice> And nonvisual
2012-01-02T13:26:50  <jmcarthur> i think it might have a lot of depth
2012-01-02T13:26:53  <jmcarthur> hmm
2012-01-02T13:26:57  <ahow984_> yes, that would be crucial pairofdice
2012-01-02T13:27:34  <jmcarthur> i think there might be a creative visualization for the communication
2012-01-02T13:28:20  <jmcarthur> but i admit i can't think of a good one yet
2012-01-02T13:28:41  <ahow984_> what about a racing game?
2012-01-02T13:29:05  <pairofdice> racing xpilot game!
2012-01-02T13:29:10  <jmcarthur> g2g
2012-01-02T13:29:13  <ahow984_> how would that work?
2012-01-02T13:29:17  <ahow984_> ttyl jmcarthur
2012-01-02T13:29:30  <pairofdice> With spaceships and gravity
2012-01-02T13:29:43  <pairofdice> And tunnels or waypoint
2012-01-02T13:29:50  <ahow984_> wheres the race though? :P
2012-01-02T13:29:59  <pairofdice> ehh
2012-01-02T13:30:12  <pairofdice> Where's the race... you make it
2012-01-02T13:30:17  <mcstar> i'd like some elements of special and general relativity
2012-01-02T13:30:27  <ahow984_> I don't understand....
2012-01-02T13:30:43  <mcstar> with some smaller c, and the relativistic effect would creep up way sooner
2012-01-02T13:30:47  <ahow984_> xpilot is asteroids, there is no race in asteroids....
2012-01-02T13:31:03  <pairofdice> And?
2012-01-02T13:31:31  <ahow984_> I dunno, I don't see the racing part of a game with no race in it....
2012-01-02T13:32:06  <pairofdice> Don't make me swear
2012-01-02T13:32:20  <mcstar> youve got to race to objectives
2012-01-02T13:32:39  <ahow984_> mcstar: ok, that makes sense so
2012-01-02T13:32:40  <ahow984_> ty
2012-01-02T13:32:44  <pairofdice> Implementing a race in any game isn't difficult
2012-01-02T13:33:23  <pairofdice> When I say "like x" people take it literally "x"
2012-01-02T13:33:45  <mcstar> like what?
2012-01-02T13:34:01  <mcstar> XD
2012-01-02T13:34:07  <pairofdice> D:
2012-01-02T13:34:07  <ahow984_> :P
2012-01-02T13:35:07  <ahow984_> hmmmm
2012-01-02T13:36:09  <ahow984_> how about a maze finding race?
2012-01-02T13:36:14  <mcstar> UncleVasya: how are you progressing?
2012-01-02T13:36:32  <ahow984_> so you've got 4 players in 4 corners of a maze, it's a race to the center
2012-01-02T13:36:44  * UncleVasya was hoping you forget already
2012-01-02T13:36:50  <ahow984_> you've got a fog of war type thing so you can't see the whole map at once
2012-01-02T13:36:56  <mcstar> youre not that lucky
2012-01-02T13:37:00  <ahow984_> first to the center wins
2012-01-02T13:37:24  <mcstar> ahow984_: either optimal solution exists, or theres too much undertainity
2012-01-02T13:37:24  <UncleVasya> can you give me a link to an explanation what you have used to code your solution?
2012-01-02T13:37:50  <mcstar> UncleVasya: http://www.freewebs.com/permute/soda_submit.html
2012-01-02T13:37:53  <ahow984_> mcstar:
2012-01-02T13:37:59  <ahow984_> hear me out ;)
2012-01-02T13:38:09  <ahow984_> this is where the communication could come in
2012-01-02T13:38:22  <mcstar> UncleVasya: The SEPA Algorithm paragraph
2012-01-02T13:38:23  <UncleVasya> hmm, I thought you have another one
2012-01-02T13:38:45  <mcstar> The key field can be determined by checking pairs of digits (or fields) starting from the rear (or right side) of the set. For each pair, if the left value of the pair is smaller than the right, then the field on the left is the key field. At this point all values to the right of the key field must be in sorted order from right to left (if not a field to the right would be the key field). If the key does
2012-01-02T13:38:47  <mcstar> not exist, the last permutation has been created. At this time, the data set is in reverse sorted order (from left to right).
2012-01-02T13:39:01  <mcstar> To find the next permutation in order, the key field must be exchanged with the smallest value in the tail which is larger than the key value. For example in the data set "abdca" the field with the value 'b' is the key, and the field containing the value 'c' has the smallest value in the tail which is larger than the key value. After swapping values, the set becomes "acdba". It is possible to find this
2012-01-02T13:39:03  <mcstar> value by comparing each value with the key value, starting at the end of the data set. The first value larger than the key value is the value to be exchanged with the key value. Notice that the tail (the 'c' is the key now) is still in reverse sorted order. This is important, because the last step is putting the tail into sorted order.
2012-01-02T13:39:13  <mcstar> thats my flooding for the day

2012-01-02T13:57:37  <UncleVasya> 2. Swap Ai and Ai+1

2012-01-02T14:00:07  <mcstar> 1. search from right to left until a_i < a_i+1, remember i
2012-01-02T14:01:00  <mcstar> 2. search from i+1 to end, find k a_k > a_i, find lowest a_k

2012-01-02T15:45:01  <mcstar> im not sure how this is implemented in ocaml, but in common lisp im certain, it must travel the list, and im relatively sure in haskell too
2012-01-02T15:45:36  <mcstar> if in caml, the list type is some boxed type, it might just "know" its length, but i doubt that
2012-01-02T15:46:10  <mcstar> (List.length tail), b
2012-01-02T15:46:17  <mcstar> this is what you return at one point

2012-01-02T15:46:49  <mcstar> what is b is not of type "integer" or whatever it is called in ocaml
2012-01-02T15:46:54  <mcstar> what if*
2012-01-02T15:51:04  <mcstar> btw it is probably wrong

2012-01-02T15:54:14  <UncleVasya> I should replace -1 with some kind of nil, NULL, None or whatever is works for OCaml but I need to find the right one first.
2012-01-02T15:54:23  <UncleVasya> If such one exists
2012-01-02T15:56:06  <mcstar> you can return a list [index, element]
2012-01-02T15:56:34  <mcstar> and in the [] and [x] case only [] or [x] too
2012-01-02T15:56:55  <mcstar> so it willl fit a different pattern when you match find_key's output in next_permutation
2012-01-02T15:57:17  <mcstar> im guessing you now return a tuple
2012-01-02T15:57:38  <mcstar> not guessing
2012-01-02T15:57:51  <UncleVasya> i'm guessing too :)

2012-01-02T16:29:56  <mcstar> or did the compiler complain about non-exhaustive patterns?
2012-01-02T16:30:22  <UncleVasya> Because I don't like when compiler shows wanings.
2012-01-02T16:30:36  <mcstar> thats what i thought
2012-01-02T16:30:41  <mcstar> what was it?
2012-01-02T16:30:44  <UncleVasya> Is it good?
2012-01-02T16:31:07  <mcstar> UncleVasya: what do you mean?
2012-01-02T16:31:35  <UncleVasya> That I insert not-relevant code to avoid warnings.
2012-01-02T16:31:52  <mcstar> id like to see the warning
2012-01-02T16:32:07  <UncleVasya> Or is warnings avoiding is a good style in programming?
2012-01-02T16:32:11  <mcstar> it is surprising to me that it generates a warning wo the catch-all patterm
2012-01-02T16:32:33  <mcstar> yes, i think you should write that generates no warnings
2012-01-02T16:32:38  <mcstar> write code*
2012-01-02T16:32:44  <UncleVasya> Because there are such cases as
2012-01-02T16:32:55  <UncleVasya> Nono, Some  and  Some, None.
2012-01-02T16:33:00  <UncleVasya> *None
2012-01-02T16:33:26  <mcstar> how?
2012-01-02T16:33:53  <UncleVasya> No way they gonna happen but they are exist
2012-01-02T16:34:02  <mcstar> find_key always return Some a, Some b OR None, None
2012-01-02T16:34:13  <mcstar> thats the point, they cant happen
2012-01-02T16:34:43  <mcstar> thats why im interested in the warning message, since i expected the type-checker to know this
2012-01-02T16:35:16  <UncleVasya> Does Haskell understand that if some case isn't going to happen, you do not need a match for it?
2012-01-02T16:35:29  <mcstar> you dont need to match at all
2012-01-02T16:35:41  <mcstar> but if some case falls through, you get a run.-time error
2012-01-02T16:36:17  <mcstar> but apparently, there are some deep thoughts regarding here
2012-01-02T16:36:32  <mcstar> ocaml went in the other direction, that it always expects all cases to be covered
2012-01-02T16:36:46  <mcstar> while haskell allows for this kind of stuff
2012-01-02T16:36:56  <UncleVasya> hmmm, you have all your code in 32 lines and I have only find_key in 22...
2012-01-02T16:37:52  <mcstar> you should write the whole function, and we compare sizes after that ok?
2012-01-02T16:38:17  <mcstar> the relevant part is 11 lines

If there isn't another spot for the forums, I can try putting them on the archive server for now and see how it works.

2012-01-02T18:20:59  <UncleVasya> I think your solution is more styled like functional because I don't understand it :)
2012-01-02T18:21:11  <mcstar> how can i load that up in ocaml?
2012-01-02T18:21:26  <mcstar> i mean into the interpreter
2012-01-02T18:21:28  <UncleVasya> I didn't even tried to write something without them.

2012-01-02T18:26:02  <McLeopold> yeah
2012-01-02T18:26:18  <McLeopold> starting the work to dump PHP for good
2012-01-02T18:26:33  <amstan> wanna move it to the aichallenge organization?
2012-01-02T18:26:40  <UncleVasya> wow, you guys already talking about code! Seems we'll have something to play with soon enough.
2012-01-02T18:26:41  <McLeopold> no
2012-01-02T18:26:48  <McLeopold> just do a submodule
2012-01-02T18:27:06  <amstan> yeah, but moving it should simplify permission management
2012-01-02T18:27:42  <McLeopold> I can remove you guys, that was just my simple method of letting you know it was there
2012-01-02T18:27:54  <amstan> oh, ok

2012-01-02T18:38:04  <greghaynes> all tabs all the time
2012-01-02T18:38:13  <amstan> greghaynes: spaces for indents though
2012-01-02T18:38:25  <greghaynes> yep
2012-01-02T18:38:26  <amstan> i would like to have the same conventions as the kernel code
2012-01-02T18:38:40  <greghaynes> no you wouldnt
2012-01-02T18:38:46  <greghaynes> they use old c style
2012-01-02T18:38:55  <amstan> what do you mean?
2012-01-02T18:38:59  <greghaynes> well, maybe they dont still, but I know some code is in it
2012-01-02T18:39:27  <greghaynes> int i; \n void foo(x) \n { ... }
2012-01-02T18:39:32  <greghaynes> which is just odd
2012-01-02T18:40:00  <amstan> oh, you mean the { on a newline after function declarations?
2012-01-02T18:40:08  <greghaynes> nono, the var before function
2012-01-02T18:40:16  <greghaynes> wait, void foo() int i; { }
2012-01-02T18:40:20  <mcstar> lol
2012-01-02T18:40:21  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-02T18:40:22  <amstan> oh, wtf?
2012-01-02T18:40:25  <mcstar> actually no
2012-01-02T18:40:31  <mcstar> void foo(i) int i; {}
2012-01-02T18:40:38  <amstan> greghaynes: anyway, i don't think that's relevant though, we have like 1% C code
2012-01-02T18:40:40  <greghaynes> yea, I never use it so it takes a second
2012-01-02T18:40:49  <amstan> greghaynes: pretty much same conventions as xsbs
2012-01-02T18:40:59  <amstan> as long as that indent github bot didn't screw it up
2012-01-02T18:41:06  <mcstar> it was the old C standard, my friend got confused about it some time ago
2012-01-02T18:41:15  <greghaynes> yea, thats how k&r is

2012-01-02T19:52:26  <janzert> in what way?
2012-01-02T19:52:34  <amstan> well.. the moving part
2012-01-02T19:52:42  <amstan> to archive
2012-01-02T19:52:59  <janzert> the current primary server is more than we need/too expensive for in between contests
2012-01-02T19:53:06  <amstan> yeah, i know
2012-01-02T19:53:15  <amstan> so what are we moving over? and when?
2012-01-02T19:53:15  <janzert> so I'm getting ready to shut it down, everything but the forums is moved
2012-01-02T19:53:36  <amstan> oh! darn
2012-01-02T19:53:38  <janzert> I'm not sure the archive server is up to handling the forum load though
2012-01-02T19:53:45  <amstan> i didn't see there was more in ants
2012-01-02T19:53:51  <amstan> sorry, in /media
2012-01-02T19:53:55  <amstan> i tought ants was in archive
2012-01-02T19:54:02  <janzert> I thought you had mentioned before that you had another server for them
2012-01-02T19:54:04  <amstan> what's /media/scratch?
2012-01-02T19:54:05  <janzert> ahh
2012-01-02T19:54:24  <janzert> just a directory I used as a mount point while moving stuff
2012-01-02T19:54:31  <janzert> it can/should go away now
2012-01-02T19:54:43  <amstan> what about archive? shouldn't ants be in there?
2012-01-02T19:54:59  <janzert> nah, it's a bit misnamed but that is just planetwars and tron
2012-01-02T19:55:15  <amstan> how did you get mysql working?
2012-01-02T19:55:18  <janzert> archive and ants are there own volume
2012-01-02T19:55:26  <janzert> ?
2012-01-02T19:55:37  <amstan> remember that i was causing problems when we first got archive
2012-01-02T19:55:38  <janzert> there were apparmor problems a long time ago
2012-01-02T19:55:52  <janzert> ahh, yes that was the apparmor thing I believe
2012-01-02T19:55:57  <amstan> i was looking around, there seems to be no /var/lib/mysql
2012-01-02T19:56:10  <amstan> how does that work?
2012-01-02T19:56:14  <janzert> yeah, it's there
2012-01-02T19:56:27  <janzert> it just has symlinks to each contest database
2012-01-02T19:56:28  <amstan> idk why i remember it wasn't,  i was looking just today
2012-01-02T19:56:31  <amstan> ok, cool
2012-01-02T19:56:35  <amstan> so they should be working
2012-01-02T19:56:38  <amstan> let me point domains over
2012-01-02T19:57:19  <amstan> ok, i'll point tron and planetwars for now to the archive one
2012-01-02T19:57:25  <janzert> also sometime I'd like to change the main aichallenge.org to a summary page that just says we're between contests and has links to the old contests, forums and IRC
2012-01-02T19:57:36  <janzert> ok
2012-01-02T19:57:53  <amstan> yeah, it would be nice to have a main page of some sorts
2012-01-02T19:57:59  <MettaWorldPeace> ^this
2012-01-02T19:58:09  <amstan> i'll ping aarossig about it
2012-01-02T19:58:14  <amstan> or something
2012-01-02T19:58:27  <janzert> yeah, it's not a huge rush of course
2012-01-02T19:58:53  <janzert> btw, I'm opposed to starting another contest until the non-profit status has been worked out :/
2012-01-02T19:58:54  <amstan> ok, ants planetwars and tron point to archive
2012-01-02T19:59:03  <janzert> great
2012-01-02T19:59:04  <amstan> janzert: yes, i am too
2012-01-02T19:59:57  <amstan> contestbot: dns ants.aichallenge.org
2012-01-02T19:59:58  <contestbot> amstan: 75.101.167.80
2012-01-02T20:00:06  <amstan> seems to be in effect for contestbot
2012-01-02T20:00:38  <janzert> looks like it is for me as well
2012-01-02T20:01:51  <amstan> the issue that we have now is handing all the redirects
2012-01-02T20:02:05  <janzert> do you have a plan/spot for the forums or do you want me to try them on archive?
2012-01-02T20:02:12  <janzert> which ones?
2012-01-02T20:02:21  <amstan> well, i could go on my server, but i would prefer it to stay on archive
2012-01-02T20:02:39  <amstan> stuff like ai-contest.com pointing at aichallenge.org
2012-01-02T20:02:51  <amstan> and everything/forums pointing at forums.aichallenge.org
2012-01-02T20:03:02  <janzert> ok, I'll move the forums over there tonight or tomorrow and we can see how they do
2012-01-02T20:03:56  <amstan> janzert: tip: admin cp> board settings>disable board, it'll make it read only for a while till you have it copied
2012-01-02T20:03:57  <janzert> yeah, I think that is about the extent of the redirects we need at this point
2012-01-02T20:04:10  <janzert> ahh, great
2012-01-02T20:04:19  <amstan> here's what i'm thinking
2012-01-02T20:04:59  <amstan> make a beta.aichallenge.org site, which could be about development with links to everything
2012-01-02T20:05:16  <janzert> once we have placeholder main page, we can redirect everything else from aichallenge.org to ants.aichalleng.org for a few months
2012-01-02T20:05:16  <amstan> then have aichallenge.org temporarly redirect to beta
2012-01-02T20:05:30  <amstan> and redirect it to the new contest when we lauch
2012-01-02T20:06:02  <janzert> hmm, I don't think we want aichallenge.org to go to beta.aichallenge ever
2012-01-02T20:06:15  <amstan> a temporary redirect though, why not?
2012-01-02T20:06:32  <janzert> bare aichallenge.org be able to become a permanent overview page
2012-01-02T20:06:45  <amstan> well.. call it something else then, not beta
2012-01-02T20:06:58  <janzert> yeah, it's called aichallenge.org ;)
2012-01-02T20:07:21  <amstan> yeah, but how do we switch between contest and that overview page?
2012-01-02T20:07:27  <janzert> we don't
2012-01-02T20:07:37  <amstan> so how do people go to the contest then?
2012-01-02T20:07:38  <janzert> we add to the overview page when a new contest comes along
2012-01-02T20:07:57  <amstan> sounds good
2012-01-02T20:08:08  <janzert> contestname.aichallenge.org can be the direct link
2012-01-02T20:08:13  <amstan> the only issue is that we really need that overview page before we can do anything
2012-01-02T20:08:28  <janzert> yep, it shouldn't be too hard to make though
2012-01-02T20:08:38  <amstan> it should look pretty though
2012-01-02T20:08:43  <janzert> I'd like to be a static html
2012-01-02T20:09:04  <janzert> sure, and it can be refined once it's up at any point of course
2012-01-02T20:12:18  <amstan> how's this?
2012-01-02T20:12:20  <amstan> https://gist.github.com/1552940
2012-01-02T20:12:26  <amstan> oh wait
2012-01-02T20:13:53  <amstan> there
2012-01-02T20:13:55  <amstan> 307
2012-01-02T20:14:06  <amstan> does that look ok?
2012-01-02T20:14:36  <amstan> we can eventually change aichallenge.org to contain a docroot and to not redirect to ants
2012-01-02T20:14:44  <amstan> but for the next few days it'll be good
2012-01-02T20:14:57  <amstan> janzert: ^
2012-01-02T20:15:13  <janzert> thinking about it
2012-01-02T20:15:30  <janzert> for now I think I'd rather do an internal rewrite of aichallenge.org
2012-01-02T20:15:38  <janzert> [PT]
2012-01-02T20:16:12  <amstan> if it doesn't change the percieved behavoir, sure
2012-01-02T20:16:39  <janzert> a redirect is seen by the browser and involves another browser connection
2012-01-02T20:17:10  <amstan> i would like to have the ants.aichallenge.org seen in people's browsers
2012-01-02T20:17:27  <janzert> eventually, once there is something different for aichallenge.org
2012-01-02T20:17:48  <janzert> I don't want every hit to aichallenge.org to redirect
2012-01-02T20:18:05  <amstan> ideally now, because this is the time people are more likely to fix their links to the perma one
2012-01-02T20:18:45  <janzert> btw, the situation on the main server was really, really bad. ants.aichallenge.org was permanently redirected to aichallenge.org
2012-01-02T20:19:07  <janzert> so anyone that was using ants.aichallenge.org had the search engines change to aichallenge.org links already :(
2012-01-02T20:19:31  <amstan> darn
2012-01-02T20:19:40  <amstan> my bad
2012-01-02T20:19:45  <janzert> once we have a base aichallenge.org overview page all the sub-pages can permanently redirect to ants.aichallenge.org
2012-01-02T20:20:32  <amstan> i guess, but why do that for ants only and not for pw?
2012-01-02T20:20:51  <janzert> ? because it's already too late for planetwars basically
2012-01-02T20:20:56  <amstan> i guess
2012-01-02T20:21:23  <amstan> are we forever going to have permanent redirects from aichallenge.org/nousedstuff to ants?
2012-01-02T20:21:27  <janzert> if we could have done it a few months before launching ants it would have been great
2012-01-02T20:21:35  <janzert> no, just for a few months
2012-01-02T20:21:40  <amstan> ok
2012-01-02T20:22:17  <amstan> oh..
2012-01-02T20:22:19  <amstan> another problem
2012-01-02T20:22:27  <janzert> and future contests we can start on there own subdomain so we never have the problem again
2012-01-02T20:22:28  <amstan> ai-contest.com still points at ec2 ip
2012-01-02T20:22:43  <amstan> can we get the same ip?
2012-01-02T20:22:45  <janzert> I'll move the ip over to the archive server when I shut the current one down
2012-01-02T20:22:47  <janzert> yep :)
2012-01-02T20:22:50  <amstan> coo
2012-01-02T20:22:52  <amstan> cool
2012-01-02T20:23:21  <janzert> btw, I'd rather phpmyadmin not get installed on archive
2012-01-02T20:25:12  <amstan> what are we going to do about seo duplication? we'll have aichallenge.org and ants.aichallenge.org with the same content
2012-01-02T20:25:38  <janzert> not for too long hopefully
2012-01-02T20:25:44  <amstan> ok
2012-01-02T20:25:54  <amstan> then all we need is serveralias aichallenge.org in the ants config
2012-01-02T20:26:04  <amstan> and this file: https://gist.github.com/1552940
2012-01-02T20:26:23  <janzert> actually since ants is setup as the default site it will just work ;)
2012-01-02T20:26:29  <amstan> sure
2012-01-02T20:26:47  <janzert> but yeah a permanent redirect for ai-contest would be good
2012-01-02T20:26:55  <amstan> tell me when you change the archive server's ip
2012-01-02T20:27:24  <janzert> it'll probably be tomorrow unless I get suddenly energetic tonight ;)
2012-01-02T20:27:47  <janzert> oh, the archive server will keep its current ip as well
2012-01-02T20:27:53  <amstan> oh, ok
2012-01-02T20:27:55  <amstan> lol
2012-01-02T20:28:19  <amstan> i'm playing with this pyqt asteroids prototype
2012-01-02T20:28:54  <janzert> I've just started working my way through some of the game suggestions

2012-01-02T21:48:54  <amstan> yeah... that right thing is useless
2012-01-02T21:48:57  <amstan> removing it actually..
2012-01-02T21:49:25  <MettaWorldPeace_> i was hoping the next one would involve pathfinding

2012-01-02T23:26:57  <amstan> have a look
2012-01-02T23:27:14  <MettaWorldPeace_> checked it out
2012-01-02T23:27:39  <MettaWorldPeace_> so hello world is what we have to improve?
2012-01-02T23:27:47  <MettaWorldPeace_> like the starter bot?
2012-01-02T23:28:50  <amstan> MettaWorldPeace_: no idea yet, just a test

2012-01-02T23:29:22  <amstan> targetai is also a good start
2012-01-02T23:29:32  <MettaWorldPeace_> looking forward to it
2012-01-02T23:29:36  <amstan> but it always shoots where they were, it could predict where they're going
2012-01-02T23:29:43  <amstan> aka linear targeting
2012-01-02T23:29:58  <amstan> but then you could also dodge
2012-01-02T23:30:01  <MettaWorldPeace_> ah
2012-01-02T23:30:28  <MettaWorldPeace_> a whole new ball of wax
2012-01-02T23:30:36  <amstan> also i also need to get asteroids and more collisions
2012-01-02T23:31:10  <pairofdice> And either wrapping or just bounce off the wall
2012-01-02T23:31:17  <amstan> yes.. wrapping too
2012-01-02T23:32:01  <pairofdice> How faithful to asteroids do you want to be
2012-01-02T23:32:12  <amstan> not sure
2012-01-02T23:32:27  <amstan> i urge people to fork and try it out
2012-01-02T23:44:40  <antimatroid> are there input specs anywhere?

2012-01-02T23:48:01  <amstan> all in one line, lol
2012-01-02T23:48:09  <antimatroid> what is dh and ds?
2012-01-02T23:48:18  <amstan> ds is acceleration
2012-01-02T23:48:26  <amstan> dh is how fast you want to turn
2012-01-02T23:48:36  <antimatroid> so you can only turn in one direction?
2012-01-02T23:48:40  <amstan> shoot(velocity)
2012-01-02T23:48:52  <amstan> you go negative dh if you wanna turn the other way
2012-01-02T23:50:12  <antimatroid> what's input data for asteroids, enemies etc?
2012-01-02T23:50:24  <antimatroid> i assume you get like a position, radius, direction and speed?
2012-01-02T23:50:45  <amstan> well.. you have access to everything that's in the ship class
2012-01-02T23:50:51  <amstan> there's no asteroids yet
2012-01-02T23:51:04  <antimatroid> aren't there in that youtube movie?
2012-01-02T23:51:12  <amstan> it's not the same one
2012-01-02T23:51:57  <antimatroid> ah okay
2012-01-02T23:53:52  <antimatroid> can one interact with bots that aren't written in python?
2012-01-02T23:54:12  <antimatroid> hence my question about input :P
2012-01-02T23:55:24  <amstan> no
2012-01-02T23:55:30  <amstan> you'll need a python class
