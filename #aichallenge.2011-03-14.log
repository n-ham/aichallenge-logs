2011-03-14T00:00:13  <McLeopold> and the engine just spawns food in the one part
2011-03-14T00:00:13  <antimatroid> they must come up with some horrible hacks with game mechanics for actual retail games
2011-03-14T00:00:28  <McLeopold> thinking it is spawning food for everyone, that can be unfair
2011-03-14T00:00:33  <_flag> McLeopold: Then spawn it in all parts?
2011-03-14T00:00:46  <McLeopold> yes :)
2011-03-14T00:01:17  <_flag> Either I'm really confused, or you guys are over complicating things
2011-03-14T00:01:32  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so, spawn one food for each section, pick one subsection from each section not touching, pick one free land space in each subsection
2011-03-14T00:01:59  <McLeopold> layer appropriately for best results
2011-03-14T00:02:31  <McLeopold> for each subsection choice, make sure each one gets an even distribution
2011-03-14T00:02:47  <McLeopold> so there isn't one sub-section that got 5 hits and one that got 1
2011-03-14T00:03:00  <McLeopold> keep a max diff of 1 or 2
2011-03-14T00:04:02  <McLeopold> or, we could say don't spawn food within X of 2 different ants, but that would be expensive to compute

2011-03-14T00:26:15  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i was thinking like follows
2011-03-14T00:27:50  <antimatroid> find the set of squares that never translate to each other at the start (this is easier than it sounds), then randomly put them into a list, then each turn go to your selected square and increment the number of food squares needing to be spawned there, if that was currently 0, add the position to the queue of squares to spawn food at
2011-03-14T00:29:18  <antimatroid> sigh: ^^ does that make sense, and go along with your interpretation of things?
2011-03-14T00:30:08  <sigh> that makes sense
2011-03-14T00:31:27  <antimatroid> i don't think that'd be too hard to implement
2011-03-14T00:36:44  <McLeopold> I doesn't make sense yet
2011-03-14T00:37:15  <antimatroid> McLeopold: do you understand that for any location, translating it by rtrans,ctrans n times will get you back to the same location?
2011-03-14T00:37:32  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-14T00:37:36  <McLeopold> I need pictures :)
2011-03-14T00:38:05  <McLeopold> are rtrans and ctrans variables, or a property of the map
2011-03-14T00:38:44  <antimatroid> the map generator picks them, but you can get them from the different between row,col of any two enemy ants starting positions
2011-03-14T00:39:12  <antimatroid> so say you have loc1 and loc2, rtrans = abs(loc1.row-loc2.row), similarly for ctrans
2011-03-14T00:40:04  <antimatroid> then translating loc1 is just loc = ((loc1.row+rtrans)%rows, ...)
2011-03-14T00:40:14  <McLeopold> so, on a 4x4 map, with rtrans=2 and ctrans=1, n would be 4?
2011-03-14T00:40:30  <antimatroid> yes, but i wouldn't allow that map
2011-03-14T00:40:33  <McLeopold> and there would be 8 sets
2011-03-14T00:40:50  <antimatroid> you would have 2 squares to order for placing food
2011-03-14T00:41:04  <McLeopold> where do you get 2?
2011-03-14T00:41:19  <antimatroid> wait, maybe 4
2011-03-14T00:41:25  <McLeopold> yeah, 4 set
2011-03-14T00:41:27  <McLeopold> s
2011-03-14T00:41:58  <antimatroid> you just take one of those sets, order them randomly, then place the food in each of the equivalent squares selected each turn
2011-03-14T00:42:21  <McLeopold> or, order the sets you mean
2011-03-14T00:42:28  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-14T00:42:33  <McLeopold> okay
2011-03-14T00:42:51  <antimatroid> my map generator enforces no two enemy ants start in the same row or column, as it looks better and makes it easier to calculate rtrans and ctrans
2011-03-14T00:43:45  <antimatroid> still need pictures? they'd be quite messy
2011-03-14T00:44:31  <antimatroid> what paint program do i want for ubuntu?
2011-03-14T00:46:01  <McLeopold> no, I don't need pictures
2011-03-14T00:46:33  <McLeopold> what types of symmetry are you doing?
2011-03-14T00:47:24  <antimatroid> that is it
2011-03-14T00:47:29  <antimatroid> i can't think of any other way to do symmetry
2011-03-14T00:47:56  <McLeopold> well, for 4 players in a square, you could do mirror or radial
2011-03-14T00:48:05  <McLeopold> or just tellelate
2011-03-14T00:48:05  <antimatroid> yeah, but not arbitrarily for n players
2011-03-14T00:48:10  <McLeopold> uh tesselate
2011-03-14T00:48:21  <antimatroid> my method atm is just tesselating
2011-03-14T00:48:30  <McLeopold> no, each player count would have it's own set of symmetry options
2011-03-14T00:48:49  <McLeopold> anything divisible by 2 can be mirror
2011-03-14T00:48:53  <antimatroid> true
2011-03-14T00:49:32  <antimatroid> that would mean people can come across each other on symmetric terms
2011-03-14T00:49:44  <McLeopold> I'm installing ubuntu on my other laptop right now
2011-03-14T00:49:54  <antimatroid> in mine, at the start, if you meet an enemy, you both took different starting paths and are facing each other asymmetrically
2011-03-14T00:50:04  <antimatroid> i really like it so far
2011-03-14T00:50:27  <antimatroid> i am going to have a go at setting up that ssh key stuff with git in a bit
2011-03-14T00:50:40  <antimatroid> i don'tunderstand what the hell they mean when they ask for a passphrase
2011-03-14T00:50:44  <McLeopold> oh, I've done that on both win and linux
2011-03-14T00:51:00  <McLeopold> I've just used a blank passphrase
2011-03-14T00:51:11  <antimatroid> haha, i'll try that after
2011-03-14T00:51:15  <antimatroid> gotta finish actually cooking food now
2011-03-14T00:51:22  <McLeopold> You're ssh key can be used in lots of places, so it's like security your key
2011-03-14T00:51:52  <McLeopold> plus, you can copy your generated key to multiple machines
2011-03-14T00:52:58  <sigh> antimatroid: a passphrase is just a password for your key... otherwise anyone who got access to your key could use it
2011-03-14T00:53:29  <McLeopold> or you could generate a different key at each computer, and let github know about all of them
2011-03-14T00:55:38  <antimatroid> so i can just come up with a random piece of text?
2011-03-14T00:55:42  <antimatroid> can it contain spaces?
2011-03-14T00:55:53  <_flag> Has the food spawning bug been fixed yet?
2011-03-14T00:55:55  <sigh> yes and yes

2011-03-14T00:56:37  <McLeopold> make sure you remember it
2011-03-14T00:56:42  <antimatroid> yeah i will
2011-03-14T00:56:46  <_flag> antimatroid: gimp?
2011-03-14T00:56:49  <McLeopold> gimp
2011-03-14T00:57:15  <McLeopold> if you were on xp, I'd say use visio
2011-03-14T00:57:31  <McLeopold> I haven't found a good linux equivalent yet.
2011-03-14T00:57:44  <sigh> _flag: hasn't been fixed in the main repo, no

2011-03-14T00:59:48  <McLeopold> looks okay

2011-03-14T05:55:07  <antimatroid> player with the most ants in range gets the spawn, if it's draw the food square dies

2011-03-14T08:44:59  <antimatroid> Frontier: I've been waiting for you!!!
2011-03-14T08:45:10  <antimatroid> how do i get the greek alphabet?
2011-03-14T08:45:14  <antimatroid> i've switched to ubuntu
2011-03-14T08:45:37  <Frontier> γσμ αrε rεαllγ ςrαzγ αbσμτ τhιs :)
2011-03-14T08:45:57  <antimatroid> it was the first thing i wanted to do after getting it installed :P
2011-03-14T08:47:10  <Frontier> actually, I don't quite remember what i did
2011-03-14T08:47:22  <antimatroid> D:
2011-03-14T08:47:22  <Frontier> i think it was some file in /usr/share
2011-03-14T08:49:32  <antimatroid> i'm a big fan so far though
2011-03-14T08:50:46  <Frontier>  :) /usr/share/X11/xkb ... somewhere in there
2011-03-14T08:51:23  <Frontier> ah there it is: /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols
2011-03-14T08:51:34  <antimatroid> want to paste bin it for me? :P
2011-03-14T08:52:20  <Frontier> find your layout file there (en) and make a copy. then edit the keys you want to change. My keyboard is german, so you wont like the mix up of y and z :p
2011-03-14T08:52:59  <Frontier> anyway here is my file: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/de_gr
2011-03-14T08:53:05  <Frontier> You can use it for reference
2011-03-14T08:53:12  <antimatroid> yeah that might be better
2011-03-14T08:53:23  <antimatroid> cheers
2011-03-14T08:54:28  <antimatroid> lol, my file for that is 1000 lines long
2011-03-14T08:55:37  <antimatroid> oh wait, err
2011-03-14T08:55:53  <Frontier> Have fun ! btw, you'll have to manually set the new layout, as it is unknown to Gnome. open gconf-editor and go to: /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd/layouts
2011-03-14T08:55:53  <antimatroid> Frontier: did you just set if for capslock?
2011-03-14T08:56:16  <Frontier> antimatroid: I set it for AltGr+ combinations
2011-03-14T08:56:27  <antimatroid> what is AltGr?
2011-03-14T08:57:01  <Frontier> There is one default layout and one 'l33t' layout that changes some of the latin letters into greek
2011-03-14T08:57:15  <Frontier> AltGr is Ctrl+Alt+
2011-03-14T08:57:47  <Frontier> Most keyboards have a special key for that.
2011-03-14T08:57:56  <antimatroid> altwin maybe?
2011-03-14T08:58:13  <Frontier> no it has nothing to do with the windows key
2011-03-14T08:58:28  <Naktibalda> it's right Alt on my keyboard
2011-03-14T08:59:20  <Frontier> In /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd/layouts edit the key 'layouts'.
2011-03-14T09:00:14  <Frontier> I set the list to: [de_gr, de_gr	leet]  <- note the tab in front of the sub-layout name leet.
2011-03-14T09:00:47  <Frontier> de_gr\tleet
2011-03-14T09:01:33  <Frontier> Τhεη γσμ ςαη sωιτςh γσμr lαγσμτ εαsιlγ ωιτh α hστκεγ σr bγ ςlιςjιηg τhε lαγσμτ ιςση ιη τhε sγsτεm τrαγ.

2011-03-14T09:04:50  <Frontier> ε
2011-03-14T09:05:55  <antimatroid> Frontier: so I could really just have leet as the second option in capslock and switch it from normal when i want?
2011-03-14T09:06:47  <Frontier> You can set it up any way you want, yes.
2011-03-14T09:07:12  <Frontier> I just left the original file unchanged so it doesn't get overwritten by updates.
2011-03-14T09:08:29  <Frontier> My basic layout adds greek symbols to the RightAlt and RightAlt+Shift combinations, because I don't need RightAlt (or AltGr) for anything else.
2011-03-14T09:09:32  <Frontier> Τhε lεετ lαγσμτ ωαs jμsτ mεαητ τσ mακε γσμ sωιτςh τσ Lιημχ.
2011-03-14T09:10:23  <antimatroid> i get an error when i set that layouts key thing
2011-03-14T09:10:47  <Frontier> does it work when you set my unchanged file?
2011-03-14T09:10:48  <antimatroid> nevermind
2011-03-14T09:10:57  <Frontier> kk
2011-03-14T09:12:09  <antimatroid> oh wait, i don't think i'm doing this right, hang on
2011-03-14T09:18:32  <antimatroid> i can't add files to that folder :\
2011-03-14T09:18:38  <antimatroid> is that a file permissions thing?
2011-03-14T09:21:27  <Frontier> sure, you need to right click the folder and select 'open as administrator#
2011-03-14T09:22:28  <Frontier> In fact a user account should have write access to nothing more than /home/<username>
2011-03-14T09:22:41  <Frontier> and some tmp directory of course
2011-03-14T09:22:56  <antimatroid> open as admin isn't there 8|
2011-03-14T09:23:53  <Frontier> then use either a terminal and the command line to get things done (look for the root-terminal in the gnome menu) or press Alt-F2
2011-03-14T09:24:02  <Frontier> and enter gksu nautilus
2011-03-14T09:25:31  <Frontier> This opens a new file explorer instance as the root user. It will also load any settings from the root account (options, layout, colors, ...)
2011-03-14T09:26:32  <Frontier> well... or you can log into your system as the root user from the login prompt :)
2011-03-14T09:27:09  <antimatroid> okaz thatäs done and this is me tzping with it
2011-03-14T09:27:11  <Frontier> Hint: When you select log out... from the menu there is an option to switch the user without actually logging out.

2011-03-14T11:50:26  <antimatroid> we sort of worked out how to do symmetric food spawning in something more relevant to what you were asking about
2011-03-14T11:51:43  <amstan> antimatroid: you were asking about jeff, what do you need from him?
2011-03-14T11:52:15  <antimatroid> nothing major atm i don't think
2011-03-14T11:52:31  <antimatroid> we need to get things running for tests before we really need him again

2011-03-14T12:02:01  <amstan> a figure that has been circulating around

2011-03-14T12:08:31  <antimatroid> nope, how old is it?
2011-03-14T12:08:38  <antimatroid> we only just came up with the newest method earlier
2011-03-14T12:08:48  <antimatroid> i haven't really been happy with a method till that
2011-03-14T12:09:14  <amstan> antimatroid: i have no idea, i just know there's a branch in sigh's repo: https://github.com/sigh/aichallenge/commits/sym-food
2011-03-14T12:09:42  <antimatroid> yeah i think that's older
2011-03-14T12:10:08  <antimatroid> the new method might actually do a pretty good job at keeping it symmetric from starting positions in a "fair" way
2011-03-14T12:10:15  <amstan> ok
2011-03-14T12:10:27  <amstan> antimatroid: how's the code separated right now?
2011-03-14T12:10:35  <amstan> antimatroid: is there anything in manager/ that's ants related?
2011-03-14T12:10:47  <antimatroid> i haven't touched that code

2011-03-14T12:11:39  <amstan> antimatroid: i would just like to keep the ants stuff separated from manager
2011-03-14T12:11:51  <amstan> so.. no mapgens, tournament engines, food spawners in there
2011-03-14T12:12:33  <amstan> antimatroid: what's manager/map_analyzer.py?
2011-03-14T12:12:51  <antimatroid> it's to help throw out stupid asymmetric maps
2011-03-14T12:13:09  <antimatroid> i placed that where mcleopold told me to, you'll need to talk to him about where stuff is meant to be going
2011-03-14T12:13:31  <antimatroid> it shouldn't be much of an issue to move it i don't think
2011-03-14T12:13:45  <amstan> antimatroid: see if something calls it, if not, move it

2011-03-14T12:16:15  <janzert> Mcleopold already did a lot of major cleaning and changing but it's still all sitting in the new schema branch
2011-03-14T12:16:26  <janzert> so will be cleaned up when he merges back in

2011-03-14T12:18:20  <amstan> janzert: oh.. nvm, you said mcleopold
2011-03-14T12:18:48  <amstan> janzert: ok, i'll have to talk to him then to see what's happening
2011-03-14T12:19:01  <amstan> any idea when he goes online?
2011-03-14T12:19:20  <janzert> usually late afternoon or evening
2011-03-14T12:19:28  <janzert> he's in pacific time I believe
2011-03-14T12:19:33  <amstan> oh, decent
2011-03-14T12:19:58  <amstan> contestbot: later tell mcleopold wanna dev tonight? i'm in EST
2011-03-14T12:19:58  <contestbot> amstan: Ready to serve, my lord.
2011-03-14T12:21:23  <Frontier> McLeopold has 9:18 AM right now
2011-03-14T12:22:55  <amstan> Frontier: if he's pst he should have 10:18, daylight savings was this weekend
2011-03-14T12:23:07  <amstan> wait.. no, i can't do math
2011-03-14T12:23:09  <amstan> 9 is right
2011-03-14T12:23:32  <jbroman> amstan: Yeah, we have DST, too.
2011-03-14T12:23:53  <amstan> jbroman: somehow i did 12-3=10
2011-03-14T12:24:25  <jbroman> amstan: Time math is hard. I always read 1530 as 2:30 PM. (For some reason, 1430 is also 2:30 in my mind.)
2011-03-14T12:24:41  <amstan> lol
2011-03-14T12:34:38  <Frontier> hehe, I just assume Gnome can do the math if I set the right time zone in the clock applet.
2011-03-14T12:34:41  <amstan> janzert: what about the simple-json stuff? you say that it's a pretty simple process to convert them? will i be able to do that myself?
2011-03-14T12:35:15  <janzert> should be able to, if mcleopold hasn't already
2011-03-14T12:35:36  <janzert> I'm pretty sure everywhere it is used currently the import is done as "import simplejson as json"
2011-03-14T12:35:46  <janzert> in which case the conversion is "import json"
2011-03-14T12:35:50  <janzert> :)
2011-03-14T12:36:23  <janzert> and it might only be used in one place, the worker tournament manager
2011-03-14T12:36:27  *** Kingpin13 <Kingpin13!~Kingpin13@Wikipedia/Kingpin13> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-14T12:36:36  <janzert> in which case I think mcleopold did a full rewrite
2011-03-14T12:36:44  <amstan> janzert: you have it in the install script too: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blame/epsilon-new-schema/setup/server_setup.py
2011-03-14T12:37:12  <janzert> ahh, not using it just installing it though right?
2011-03-14T12:37:22  <janzert> it can just be dropped from the list of install packages
2011-03-14T12:38:09  <janzert> but I'm mostly waiting for the grand merge to take place before doing much more on the setup scripts since a lot of things have changed
2011-03-14T12:38:45  <amstan> yeah, i think we should merge, there's no point to not do it, neither branches work anyway
2011-03-14T12:38:57  <janzert> yep
2011-03-14T12:39:15  <amstan> and some people started to apply unrelated changes in the new-schema branch
2011-03-14T12:39:24  <amstan> the only way to have those in the normal branch is to merge
2011-03-14T12:39:42  <janzert> the new-schema branch has much more than the name implies yes
2011-03-14T12:39:52  <amstan> that shouldn't be the case
2011-03-14T12:40:17  <amstan> contestbot: later tell bss03 Please look over this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/#issue/7/comment/869773
2011-03-14T12:40:17  <contestbot> amstan: I think that worked...
2011-03-14T12:40:32  <janzert> it's really the de facto main line of development for the last couple weeks
2011-03-14T12:40:57  <amstan> janzert: i've been trying to merge starter packages and Frontier has been working on the visualizer in the epsilon branch
2011-03-14T12:41:21  <amstan> ok.. oppening an issue
2011-03-14T12:41:21  <janzert> yeah, then compare that too all the changes going on in new-schema
2011-03-14T12:41:30  <janzert> :)
2011-03-14T12:41:49  <Frontier> who have i caused trouble ? :)
2011-03-14T12:42:33  <janzert> ahh, manager/ec2-check.py uses simplejson as well at the momement
2011-03-14T12:42:51  <janzert> conversion there should be a simple import line change as well
2011-03-14T12:44:40  <amstan> Frontier: no trouble
2011-03-14T12:44:42  <Frontier> amstan: You once said that a Makefile can compile the Java applet and combine JavaScript files. I know little about Makefiles, but I would give it a try as it has to do with the visualizer. Now my question is, is there already a Makefile or where would I link it in?
2011-03-14T12:45:35  <amstan> Frontier: feel free to make a new one; we don't have a way to connect the makefiles yet. ask me for help if you need any; i like makefiles.

2011-03-14T12:47:59  <amstan> janzert: feel free to comment on the merge issue: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/24
2011-03-14T12:55:16  <Frontier> amstan: There is no Makefile in epsilon that installs anything. Or maybe I'm blind.
2011-03-14T12:55:33  <janzert> I believe all the makefiles were removed
2011-03-14T12:55:36  <amstan> Frontier: nope, they were all out of date, i deleted them, there's one makefile in the starter package folder
2011-03-14T12:56:48  <lavalamp> amstan: thanks for merging my stuff. I still plan at looking at the worker setup script to update the go installation process. I think I may be able to switch it to using a premade package now (I saw on the go mailing list that someone is now making those) instead of building the source.
2011-03-14T12:57:14  <amstan> lavalamp: decent

2011-03-14T13:08:03  <janzert> no idea
2011-03-14T13:08:26  <amstan> maybe it doesn't matter actually
2011-03-14T13:08:58  <Frontier> amstan: I'll wait with the Makefile until you created some of them. When I merge the JavaScript files I have to replace either the main js file or visualizer.php. Without an output or destination directory that's no good :p
2011-03-14T13:09:35  <amstan> Frontier: well.. i have some time, i can work on this
2011-03-14T13:09:52  <janzert> why not just make a script that takes the output location as an argument?
2011-03-14T13:10:29  <amstan> Frontier: what do you mean by replace at merge? why?

2011-03-14T13:12:02  <amstan> Frontier: we could link it from google's servers: http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery
2011-03-14T13:12:03  <Frontier> either i create a 'visualizer-min.js' and have to update the reference in visualizer.php or I replace the main js file 'visualizer.js' with the combined version

2011-03-14T13:12:56  <amstan> Frontier: yes, i saw it for the visualizer somewhere
2011-03-14T13:13:06  <amstan> or viewer: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/viewer
2011-03-14T13:13:09  <amstan> that's mcleopold then
2011-03-14T13:13:29  <Frontier> To answer your question in PlanetWars the file was requested from google and if not found there, loaded locally.
2011-03-14T13:13:55  <Frontier> So the local jquery copy was meant as a fallback
2011-03-14T13:14:18  <amstan> Frontier: ic, idk if it should be in the repo though, maybe make the installer script take care of downloading it
2011-03-14T13:14:48  <Frontier> As I said, I don't use it so... yeah
2011-03-14T13:14:56  <amstan> Frontier: anyway, so what were you saying about the -min? that you have to change the referrences when you make one?
2011-03-14T13:16:40  <amstan> Frontier: how about visualizer.full.js(your original from the repo), visualizer.min.js(compiled) visualizer.js(softlink to either of them, git will have it pointed to full)
2011-03-14T13:16:43  <Frontier> I have a script tag in the php file saying src="visualizer/js/visualizer.js". If I store the combined JavaScript in a different file I have to overwrite the php to make the change. Otherwise I have to overwrite the js to keep the php file as is
2011-03-14T13:16:57  <amstan> Frontier: and add gitignore for min and the softlink

And there is also the Java applet which needs to be compiled. I have the sources for that right next to the JavaScript sources in the www directory (bad idea?). I'm not sure what 'www' should actually contain. php, images and css only? unminimized JavaScript? Java sources? Java .class files?

2011-03-14T13:38:57  <McLeopold> did you push lately?
2011-03-14T13:39:16  <Frontier> just today. I added fog of war
2011-03-14T13:39:38  <McLeopold> You're working on epsilon, right?
2011-03-14T13:39:58  <Frontier> yep
2011-03-14T13:42:23  <McLeopold> I'm reading your readme...
2011-03-14T13:42:36  <Frontier> oh man ... that one is old ^^
2011-03-14T13:42:49  <McLeopold> did you ever use the visualize_locally.py file from the last contest?
2011-03-14T13:44:20  <Frontier> no, but if that uses the html visualizer through a python script that might be what people meant when they were using the 'html visualizer locally'
2011-03-14T13:45:57  <McLeopold> that was part of it
2011-03-14T13:46:12  <McLeopold> it would create a temp html file and write the replay output directly into the html
2011-03-14T13:46:18  <McLeopold> I'd like to avoid that this time

2011-03-14T13:46:39  <McLeopold> it also had a neat feature that would launch your default browser with the page
2011-03-14T13:46:57  <Frontier> I would like to avoid writing the replay into the html through the php script as well ^^
2011-03-14T13:47:14  <McLeopold> I think your paste option is nice.
2011-03-14T13:47:22  <McLeopold> We can add a file open option as well
2011-03-14T13:48:36  <Frontier> That's right. I'm still dreaming of using Rhino, the Java JavaScript interpreter/compiler to get an executable .jar out of the JavaScript.
2011-03-14T13:48:46  <McLeopold> And I'm hoping we can implement the engine to launch the browser automatically after a test game as well
2011-03-14T13:49:41  <McLeopold> what would that get you?
2011-03-14T13:50:24  <Frontier> McLeopold: Imagine having the visualizer in a Java app, just the way the IE version works now. That would mean a HTML/JavaScript version, an applet and an application all from the same code base :)
2011-03-14T13:51:07  <McLeopold> cool
2011-03-14T13:51:18  <McLeopold> so, locally I would launch a java app?
2011-03-14T13:51:38  <Frontier> Yes, that's the point :)  I never took the time to dive deeper into Rhino to see if that was possible.
2011-03-14T13:51:55  <McLeopold> how does ie version work now?
2011-03-14T13:52:22  <Frontier> You can define 'ScriptableObjects' or something like that, that are visible to the script engine like the 'window' object in web implementations of JavaScript
2011-03-14T13:53:05  <McLeopold> so, you created an object that acts like the canvas, but the javascript is still outside of the java applet?
2011-03-14T13:53:07  <Frontier> Currently the IE version uses an applet that communicates with JavaScript through LiveConnect. It really is a wrapper around the canvas api
2011-03-14T13:54:27  <Frontier> With Rhino I could move the JavaScript engine into the applet as well. That may be faster as well. LiveConnect works horribly slow.
2011-03-14T13:54:29  <McLeopold> so, is the java running the javascript, or the other way around?
2011-03-14T13:54:54  <Frontier> The current applet is only a drawing surface
2011-03-14T13:55:53  <Frontier> But it integrates transparently into my drawing routines. context.fillRect(0,0,10,10) means the same for the html canvas and the applet
2011-03-14T13:56:21  <McLeopold> is the context object the piece that is different?
2011-03-14T13:57:13  <Frontier> You can put it that way, yes. The canvas version and the applet version share the same interface when it comes to the rendering context, but implement it differently.
2011-03-14T13:57:45  <Frontier> of course I only had to write the Java implementation ^^
2011-03-14T13:58:48  <Frontier> I could reuse that Java implementation if I used Rhino. In the end it just means moving the JS engine out of the browser into the applet as well.
2011-03-14T13:59:01  <McLeopold> can you point me to the section that does the detect of the browser, and switches the objects?
2011-03-14T14:00:33  <Frontier> The canvas detection happens here: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/www/visualizer/js/Application.js#L146
2011-03-14T14:01:19  <Frontier> and the objects are created here: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/www/visualizer/js/Application.js#L373
2011-03-14T14:03:59  <Frontier> The applet takes some time to initialize and I must not access it during that time, so it has to call back after it is initialized. But this call back again can break the single-threadedness of JavaScript on some browsers. It just stops the current execution there and executes the callback. To avoid any race conditions I wrap every Java-to-JS call in a window.setTimeout() call. These timeouts work as expected in all browsers. T
2011-03-14T14:04:15  <McLeopold> Frontier: do you have more than 1 canvas?
2011-03-14T14:04:44  <Frontier> I have loads of them. They are ideal offscreen buffers for stuff that never changes, like the map
2011-03-14T14:04:50  <McLeopold> and, shouldn't you only have to worry about IE browsers?
2011-03-14T14:06:39  <Frontier> Sure, but I develop under Linux and had to test the applet there before I reboot into windows.
2011-03-14T14:07:18  <Frontier> Anyway I wanted to go sure that my code is clean and just works with all browsers.
2011-03-14T14:07:35  <Frontier> It's Java, it has to.
2011-03-14T14:07:40  <McLeopold> ture
2011-03-14T14:07:41  <McLeopold> true
2011-03-14T14:07:52  <McLeopold> so, for organization, I would just remove the www dir
2011-03-14T14:08:15  <McLeopold> a make file can combine the js, compile the java and move both over to the website dir
2011-03-14T14:08:36  <Frontier> remove the www dir? Literally everything is in there
2011-03-14T14:08:47  <Frontier> oh wait.. you mean the ants www dir
2011-03-14T14:08:51  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-14T14:09:01  <McLeopold> 1 extra layer too many
2011-03-14T14:09:23  <McLeopold> and, hopefully, we can get rid of that php file
2011-03-14T14:09:27  <Frontier> what about visualizer.js. It is really a typical www candidate
2011-03-14T14:09:35  <Frontier> hmm
2011-03-14T14:09:48  <McLeopold> the makefile will know where to put it
2011-03-14T14:11:21  <McLeopold> if we concat all your files, will it still work?
2011-03-14T14:12:54  <Frontier> no that is too simple though. The rule would be: Take visualizer.js and replace this file by the content of all files referenced by "import('xyz')" lines, but remove the import lines and don't concatenate any duplicate imports.
2011-03-14T14:13:54  <Frontier> I don't have any duplicate imports, and they aren't needed at some point, so that rule could be ignored.
2011-03-14T14:14:38  <Frontier> I think a Python script could do that.
2011-03-14T14:14:41  <McLeopold> so, you want to be able for it to run split and combined?
2011-03-14T14:16:22  <Frontier> I need the split version while I am working on the files. And for the web it would be better if they were combined and minified with http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/
2011-03-14T14:17:07  <jbroman> Closure Compiler might be cool, too.
2011-03-14T14:17:47  <Frontier> jbroman: Isn't that a native compiler?
2011-03-14T14:18:36  <jbroman> Frontier: Hmm?
2011-03-14T14:18:41  <jbroman> Closure Compiler is JS to JS.
2011-03-14T14:18:51  <jbroman> JS to smaller/faster/optimized JS.
2011-03-14T14:18:56  <jbroman> http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/
2011-03-14T14:19:05  <Frontier> ah ok, I thought that was an executable code compiler
2011-03-14T14:19:55  <jbroman> It will do inlining, dead code removal and other stuff I don't think YUIC does (haven't looked at it lately though).
2011-03-14T14:20:01  <McLeopold> Frontier: I'd probably refactor it so you're not doing document.write stuff.  Just create a debug html file that has a bunch of script tags.
2011-03-14T14:20:41  <McLeopold> Then we can just concat the files at it will mostly be the same

2011-03-14T14:27:05  <Frontier> hmm, I debug in both the offline.html and visualizer.php.
2011-03-14T14:29:50  <janzert> a js minimizer generally does much more than just concat files together
2011-03-14T14:30:09  <janzert> using a real minimizer of some sort is probably a good idea
2011-03-14T14:32:41  <Frontier> McLeopold: I haz idea: http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/linux_tool_guides/the_sed_faq/sedfaq4_025.html
2011-03-14T14:32:55  <Frontier> runs directly from the Makefile I assume
2011-03-14T14:34:43  <McLeopold> janzert: my thought was to concat, and then minimize
2011-03-14T14:34:53  <McLeopold> we only want minimized for the official site
2011-03-14T14:35:06  <McLeopold> as a local tool, we want the full thing
2011-03-14T14:35:16  <janzert> right, but let something like closure do all of it
2011-03-14T14:36:08  <McLeopold> okay, but it's not going to factor out the document.write
2011-03-14T14:36:21  <McLeopold> if it does, then great!
2011-03-14T14:37:30  <janzert> it won't change how the code works, no

2011-03-14T15:33:40  <amstan> McLeopold: so.. merge?
2011-03-14T15:33:43  <McLeopold> I suggest it was 1 layer 2 much
2011-03-14T15:34:43  <amstan> McLeopold: what?
2011-03-14T15:35:05  <Frontier> and I only really care about too many ad layers
2011-03-14T15:35:14  <amstan> what ads?
2011-03-14T15:35:41  <Frontier> sorry, I was trying to be funny. McLeopold wants to move stuff from ants/www into ants
2011-03-14T15:36:13  <amstan> how about `mv ants/www ants/visualizer`
2011-03-14T15:36:55  <Frontier> then you get ants/visualizer/visualizer/js/visualizer.js :)
2011-03-14T15:37:08  <McLeopold> well, more like 'mv ants/www/visualizer ants/visualizer'
2011-03-14T15:37:24  <amstan> McLeopold: +1 for that
2011-03-14T15:37:47  <Frontier> ok, but then the php file doesn't work any longer
2011-03-14T15:37:51  <McLeopold> amstan: so, you really want to get rid of epsilon-new-schema?
2011-03-14T15:38:11  <amstan> the ants/visualizer/*.php files are not ants specific and should be included in the /website/ folder

2011-03-14T15:42:03  <amstan> Frontier: makefile or .sh script could work for now, and actually be functional
2011-03-14T15:42:17  <amstan> in case nobody gets to it

2011-03-14T15:43:25  <Frontier> In the visualizer/java is the code base for the applet. It has to be compiled into classes.
2011-03-14T15:43:36  <amstan> so.. javac *.java
2011-03-14T15:44:16  <Frontier> I used com.aicontest.... package names, but you are right
2011-03-14T15:44:36  <amstan> i'm not that familiar with java packages
2011-03-14T15:45:22  <Frontier> javac visualizer/java/com/aicontest/visualizer/*.java may actually work
2011-03-14T15:45:48  <Frontier> I always use Eclipse for that, so I must check that myself
2011-03-14T15:45:49  <amstan> Frontier: it should be s/aicontest/aichallenge
2011-03-14T15:46:06  <amstan> wait..
2011-03-14T15:46:15  <amstan> does it have to be a fqdn?
2011-03-14T15:46:54  <Frontier> no, it doesn't have to be anything real, but it is common practice to use the company's web site
2011-03-14T15:47:45  <Frontier> and http://aichallenge.com/ would be utterly wrong ^^
2011-03-14T15:48:12  <amstan> yeah
2011-03-14T15:50:14  <Frontier> amstan: the command is slightly more complex. It needs the Java Web Plugin jar on the classpath. On my computer it would be:
2011-03-14T15:50:15  <Frontier> javac java/com/aicontest/visualizer/*.java -classpath /opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.24/jre/lib/plugin.jar
2011-03-14T15:51:01  <amstan> ok, i'll it
2011-03-14T15:51:14  <amstan> on my own though, you don't have to wait for me
2011-03-14T15:51:28  <Frontier> Or if the system uses java-config-2 it is independent from the sdk version and can use:
2011-03-14T15:51:29  <Frontier> javac java/com/aicontest/visualizer/*.java -classpath /etc/java-config-2/current-system-vm/jre/lib/plugin.jar
2011-03-14T15:54:05  <Frontier> Then there is the visualizer/js folder. The would be a good job for a python script. Collect all lines with "import('...');" in *.js files, make a unique list out of it and write a new file from the content of the imports.
2011-03-14T15:54:13  <Frontier> *That
2011-03-14T15:55:01  <amstan> Frontier: sure
2011-03-14T15:55:48  <Frontier> Closure Compiler can be used on the result to minimize the file size.
2011-03-14T15:57:16  <janzert> just give closure each of the js files separately
2011-03-14T15:58:03  <Frontier> janzert: Why would that be better? A browser waits for each separate .js file as far as I know.
2011-03-14T15:58:11  <janzert> and rewrite them so they aren't using the dynamic js loading
2011-03-14T15:58:19  <janzert> it'll compile all the js files into one
2011-03-14T15:59:08  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@boegel.ugent.be> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-14T15:59:17  <Frontier> hmm, ok. if I write one js file containing all the imports (and nothing else) it could work like that.
2011-03-14T15:59:28  * janzert nods
2011-03-14T16:00:20  <janzert> or just statically put all the separate script tags needed into the html when working with the unminified "development" version
2011-03-14T16:00:49  <janzert> that's probably what I would do myself, but it probably doesn't really matter
2011-03-14T16:02:56  <Frontier> janzert: I prefer to use the visualizer.php and offline.html as is. I think the solution with one import file is quite a good compromise.
2011-03-14T16:04:07  <janzert> yeah, I wouldn't use a visualizer.php for testing at all myself. just a plain test_visualizer.html
2011-03-14T16:04:14  <Frontier> I keep the name visualizer.js for this import file and when we install the www files we compile the other js files into a file with the same name. the web files can remain untouched
2011-03-14T16:04:43  <janzert> yep, that would probably work
2011-03-14T16:05:49  <Frontier> It is nice to have a database with sample replays in the background. A change to the game_id parameter and I can test a different replay. :)
2011-03-14T16:07:04  <Frontier> ok, i'm out for tonight. cu tomorrow
2011-03-14T16:09:20  <janzert> later
