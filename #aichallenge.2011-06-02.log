2011-06-02T00:06:01  <janzert> we should get the mime type set to something sane for game replay files
2011-06-02T00:06:24  <amstan> what do we have now?
2011-06-02T00:06:59  <janzert> firefox just identifies it as a php File
2011-06-02T00:07:23  <amstan> how so? it's just a text file
2011-06-02T00:07:25  <janzert> which actually rather weird
2011-06-02T00:07:55  <janzert> I was assuming from the mime type but I actually don't have a way to look at the headers of the response easily
2011-06-02T00:08:06  <jbroman> Maybe if no Content-Type is sent it looks at the extension?
2011-06-02T00:08:25  <janzert> except there is no extension
2011-06-02T00:08:30  <janzert> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/game/10000
2011-06-02T00:08:34  <amstan> janzert: you could telnet maybe?
2011-06-02T00:08:56  <jbroman> janzert: My Firefox does not identify it as PHP.
2011-06-02T00:09:35  <jbroman> In fact, it is getting served as applicaiton/json
2011-06-02T00:09:37  <amstan> janzert: i get Content-Type: text/html
2011-06-02T00:09:38  <jbroman> application*
2011-06-02T00:09:46  <janzert> heh
2011-06-02T00:10:03  <amstan> http://pastebin.com/rRXNSwtj
2011-06-02T00:10:07  <jbroman> curl --head http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/game/10000
2011-06-02T00:10:20  <amstan> jbroman: real programmers telnet directly, lol
2011-06-02T00:10:50  <amstan> we should probably fix the cache for this
2011-06-02T00:11:08  <amstan> we won't need to change the contents of replay files
2011-06-02T00:11:20  <jbroman> amstan: You got /, not /game/10000
2011-06-02T00:11:23  <jbroman> of course the home page is text/html
2011-06-02T00:11:25  <amstan> oh, right
2011-06-02T00:11:35  <jbroman> And *I'm* the newbie.
2011-06-02T00:12:12  <amstan> lol
2011-06-02T00:16:01  <janzert> hmm
2011-06-02T00:16:39  <janzert> curl shows application/json raw telnet seems to show some binary encoding? maybe gzipped
2011-06-02T00:16:56  <jbroman> It is application/json, encoded with gzip.
2011-06-02T00:17:03  <jbroman> HTTP encoding does not affect MIME type.
2011-06-02T00:17:10  <jbroman> (Since the user agent is expected to decode it.)
2011-06-02T00:17:18  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/kYwYzn9T
2011-06-02T00:17:19  <janzert> right
2011-06-02T00:17:38  <janzert> I'm not sure why firefox isn't handling it better though
2011-06-02T00:17:49  <jbroman> Dunno, seems OK for me.

2011-06-02T01:15:49  <janzert> so I've got a server and worker up on ec2 at aibeta.janzert.com
2011-06-02T01:16:11  <janzert> 4 accounts with successful submissions
2011-06-02T01:16:26  <amstan> sandboxed?
2011-06-02T01:16:28  <janzert> and a few maps for 4 players
2011-06-02T01:16:32  <janzert> amstan: yes
2011-06-02T01:16:41  <amstan> emails?
2011-06-02T01:16:45  <janzert> what do I need to get games going?
2011-06-02T01:16:51  <janzert> amstan: no email
2011-06-02T01:16:57  <amstan>  ./worker.py -n -t 0
2011-06-02T01:17:08  <janzert> amstan: yeah that's working already
2011-06-02T01:17:16  <janzert> it's compiling and testing submissions fine
2011-06-02T01:17:24  <amstan> i think the manager also needs to be on
2011-06-02T01:17:26  <McLeopold> you need maps in the database
2011-06-02T01:17:30  <amstan> oh, yes
2011-06-02T01:17:33  <janzert> ahh
2011-06-02T01:17:34  <McLeopold> the manager is only needed if you want rankings
2011-06-02T01:17:34  <janzert> probably
2011-06-02T01:17:42  <janzert> manager is actually running already
2011-06-02T01:17:44  <amstan> manager/add_maPS..
2011-06-02T01:17:57  <janzert> I got the maps in the directory but not added to the database
2011-06-02T01:18:40  <McLeopold> don't include asymmetric, btw
2011-06-02T01:19:13  <janzert> hmm, "No maps added, priorities not changed."
2011-06-02T01:19:21  <McLeopold> Automattic map creation is something I was planning to put in the manager
2011-06-02T01:19:41  <janzert> ahh, map names need to end with .map
2011-06-02T01:19:41  <McLeopold> did you copy maps files from aichallenge/ants/maps to maps?
2011-06-02T01:19:58  <janzert> no, created 20 new ones with symmetric mapgen
2011-06-02T01:20:49  <McLeopold> an underscore would have looked nicer than a zero...
2011-06-02T01:23:05  <McLeopold> janzert: did you know about integration_testing/create_test_bots?
2011-06-02T01:23:29  <janzert> sorta, as in I know exists but haven't used it at all
2011-06-02T01:23:51  <McLeopold> look at reset_server.sh
2011-06-02T01:24:03  <janzert> yay, the worker is playing a game

2011-06-02T01:25:29  <McLeopold> janzert: did you take a look at the apache settings?  I've got special extensions for serving gzipped files
2011-06-02T01:25:39  <janzert> nope
2011-06-02T01:25:45  <McLeopold> so you should be able to gzip the map files with a .mapgz
2011-06-02T01:26:47  <janzert> they're only basically downloaded by each worker once right?
2011-06-02T01:26:54  <McLeopold> yes
2011-06-02T01:27:04  <McLeopold> but others will want to download from the main site
2011-06-02T01:27:45  <McLeopold> actually, I think urllib had issues with gzipped content...
2011-06-02T01:27:48  <janzert> we should probably add a @reboot cronjob in the server_setup to start up the manager automatically
2011-06-02T01:28:34  <janzert> don't expect it to be a major bandwidth drain in any case, do you?
2011-06-02T01:28:49  <McLeopold> no, but it's there
2011-06-02T01:29:42  <McLeopold> where's the game?
2011-06-02T01:29:57  <janzert> still running it looks like
2011-06-02T01:30:20  <McLeopold> haha, golang issues?
2011-06-02T01:30:47  <janzert> yep, I think the starter bot isn't compatible with the latest go version
2011-06-02T01:31:06  <McLeopold> so how does it work on beta?
2011-06-02T01:31:32  <janzert> that's probably still using r56 I'm guessing?
2011-06-02T01:32:12  <janzert> the version installed now is r57 I believe
2011-06-02T01:33:41  <janzert> hmm, so I can see my new serial mode is running 2 bots simultaneously like I set it to but...
2011-06-02T01:33:54  <janzert> I'm starting to wonder if it has an infinite loop :(
2011-06-02T01:34:16  <McLeopold> did you do debug?
2011-06-02T01:34:22  <McLeopold> you should see the turns progress
2011-06-02T01:34:51  <janzert> nope, it's running exactly as the automatic install left it
2011-06-02T01:35:25  <janzert> oh, it just finished
2011-06-02T01:36:33  <McLeopold> game replay not found :(
2011-06-02T01:36:49  <janzert> hmm, yeah. it doesn't exist on the server
2011-06-02T01:36:56  <McLeopold> permissions issue?
2011-06-02T01:36:57  <janzert> the games directory is empty
2011-06-02T01:37:16  <janzert> yep

2011-06-02T01:38:22  <janzert> yeah, logs and maps had the correct group but not games
2011-06-02T01:38:24  <McLeopold> which I don't really like
2011-06-02T01:39:06  <McLeopold> www-data needs write access to api_log.txt (which will be turned off for launch)
2011-06-02T01:39:34  <janzert> needs write access for the apache logs too doesn't it?
2011-06-02T01:39:40  <McLeopold> no
2011-06-02T01:39:49  <McLeopold> those are owned by root
2011-06-02T01:39:54  <janzert> ahh
2011-06-02T01:40:03  <McLeopold> manager.log did need access, but I think I fixed it
2011-06-02T01:40:16  <McLeopold> though it would be nice to give it access
2011-06-02T01:40:42  <McLeopold> I was using rolling log files, and when it rolled over, the new log didn't have rights for www-data

2011-06-02T01:46:03  <janzert> too long or I messed something up when adding them?
2011-06-02T01:46:19  <McLeopold> there's a 50px style on it
2011-06-02T01:46:38  <janzert> ahh
2011-06-02T01:46:56  <McLeopold> err, 85px
2011-06-02T01:47:38  <janzert> whatever it is, it's a fixed pixel size
2011-06-02T01:47:39  <McLeopold> something had to give, too much data :)
2011-06-02T01:49:49  <janzert> yay and the leaderboard updates, but hmm isn't rank supposed to be in order of skill?
2011-06-02T01:50:22  <McLeopold> that's weird...
2011-06-02T01:50:34  <McLeopold> I thought I had fixed that...

2011-06-02T01:52:54  <janzert> what snazzy amazon web app would that be?

2011-06-02T01:55:27  <McLeopold> Don't they have something?  at least to turn it on and off?
2011-06-02T01:55:44  <janzert> oh to control the ec2 instances? yeah

2011-06-02T01:58:44  <janzert> try again now
2011-06-02T02:02:35  <janzert> ok, it let me login to that account now
2011-06-02T02:03:10  <janzert> now the question is, did I get the sudoers set up right for it?

2011-06-02T02:40:10  <janzert> pretty sure the only setting I changed was 'serial'
2011-06-02T02:40:28  <janzert> and just in server_info.php
2011-06-02T02:40:31  <McLeopold> I don't think I committed the correct values then
2011-06-02T02:41:49  <CIA-48> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * rbc42210 / (2 files): update to food amounts - http://bit.ly/jqtZOn
2011-06-02T02:43:19  <McLeopold> janzert: why is worker so slow?
2011-06-02T02:43:30  <McLeopold> I hope this isn't how it is going to really work
2011-06-02T02:43:46  <janzert> I have a feeling it is because of the serial game?
2011-06-02T02:43:53  <janzert> not sure really
2011-06-02T02:43:57  <janzert> feel free to poke at it
2011-06-02T02:44:14  <janzert> you saw the pm on a login to the worker as well?
2011-06-02T02:44:24  <janzert> I gotta get off to bed soon
2011-06-02T02:46:11  <McLeopold> jails?
2011-06-02T02:46:35  <janzert> shouldn't be slowing the actual execution down any
2011-06-02T02:46:50  <McLeopold> when I ran them it was quite a bit slower
2011-06-02T02:46:51  <janzert> but it may introduce quite a bit more overhead to start and stop bots
2011-06-02T02:47:17  <janzert> it looks to me like all the cpu in use is being used by the engine mostly
2011-06-02T02:48:29  <McLeopold> is worker in a screen?

2011-06-02T02:48:48  <janzert> also I just realized the way it is sending bots to the get_moves function it doesn't filter out dead bots first
2011-06-02T02:49:12  <janzert> so it may send only 1 or 0 live bots to it at a time
2011-06-02T02:49:14  <McLeopold> look at the javabots
2011-06-02T02:49:24  <janzert> yes?
2011-06-02T02:49:29  <McLeopold> 429M virtual?
2011-06-02T02:50:00  <janzert> yes?
2011-06-02T02:50:34  <janzert> resident is the more important number anyway right?
2011-06-02T02:50:52  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-06-02T02:51:14  <janzert> that's my understanding
2011-06-02T02:51:33  <janzert> I forgot to change the language memory size too
2011-06-02T02:51:40  <McLeopold> so, is the worker in a screen session??
2011-06-02T02:51:50  <janzert> I think it might be
2011-06-02T02:52:06  <janzert> yep
2011-06-02T02:52:07  <McLeopold> can I look?
2011-06-02T02:52:16  <janzert> of course :)
2011-06-02T02:52:47  <McLeopold> you'll need to set suid on /usr/bin/screen, then turn on multiuser and acladd
2011-06-02T02:53:05  <janzert> you should have sudo
2011-06-02T02:53:31  <janzert> I'm supposed to be at work in 7 hours so I really gotta go
2011-06-02T02:53:34  <McLeopold> okay, but I don't have access to the screen
2011-06-02T02:53:45  <janzert> it's running under root
2011-06-02T02:53:49  <janzert> pretty sure

2011-06-02T02:57:57  <janzert> hmm, probably easiest to kill it and restart it directly
2011-06-02T02:58:00  <McLeopold> k
2011-06-02T02:58:29  <janzert> actually in the screen session, fg %1 might have worked
2011-06-02T02:58:42  <McLeopold> too late :)
2011-06-02T02:58:50  <McLeopold> yeah, this is really slow
2011-06-02T02:58:52  <janzert> not sure though since it was started from the start_worker script

2011-06-02T02:59:47  <janzert> the engine still starts and stops bots even when not running in serial mode?
2011-06-02T03:00:07  <janzert> yes, I see it does
2011-06-02T03:00:47  <janzert> ugh, and it even starts and stops them multiple times in one turn
2011-06-02T03:01:03  <McLeopold> I can't compare jails to no jails cause the language were installed only inside the jails :(
2011-06-02T03:01:36  <janzert> there really isn't any execution overhead in a jail
2011-06-02T03:01:46  <janzert> it doesn't do any virtualization or such
2011-06-02T03:01:57  <McLeopold> okay, but something is going on
2011-06-02T03:02:23  <janzert> it does use the actual kill program to send the stop and resume signals
2011-06-02T03:02:39  <janzert> I have a feeling that may be what is slowing it down so much
2011-06-02T03:02:53  <McLeopold> what line?
2011-06-02T03:03:07  <janzert> sandbox.py line 99
2011-06-02T03:03:17  <janzert> it has to sudo and then run kill
2011-06-02T03:03:30  <janzert> 4 times per bot per move
2011-06-02T03:04:06  <janzert> and running it through a shell
2011-06-02T03:04:08  <McLeopold> for a dead bot only?
2011-06-02T03:04:24  <janzert> actually just for alive bots
2011-06-02T03:04:58  <janzert> getting rid of the shell=True which also requires formatting the command as a list might help some
2011-06-02T03:05:13  <janzert> it'd be one less process started per call
2011-06-02T03:06:26  <janzert> something like subprocess.cal(['sudo', '-u', self.name, 'kill', '-'+signal, '-1'])
2011-06-02T03:07:24  <McLeopold> why do we need subprocess?  doesn't python support signals?
2011-06-02T03:07:44  <janzert> we have to send the signal as the jailuser
2011-06-02T03:08:19  <janzert> contest won't have permission to send signals to a jailuser process
2011-06-02T03:09:18  <UncleVasya> janzert: Skill of some bots became changed but their Latest Games list is empty.
2011-06-02T03:09:19  <janzert> one way to check the theory may be to just comment out the places in the engine where the bots are paused and resumed
2011-06-02T03:09:54  <McLeopold> hmm..
2011-06-02T03:09:57  * janzert points toward McLeopold, he's the one that would know about that
2011-06-02T03:10:09  * McLeopold points to sigh
2011-06-02T03:10:42  <McLeopold> bedtime, this something to solve later, and it would be a showstopper
2011-06-02T03:11:28  <janzert> yeah, I'm really out too. I'll leave the server up for now

2011-06-02T06:36:47  <ohCrivens> Does anyone have any idea what could cause the Beta server to crash a Java bot with a message stating: "Could not create the Java virtual machine." ?
2011-06-02T06:44:30  <Frontier> I have, but it is a long story
2011-06-02T06:44:43  <Frontier> In short: it is out of memory.
2011-06-02T06:46:25  <Frontier> ohCrivens: I'm quite sure it is not possible to run 10 Java bots in one game at the moment. On the real servers this will be different.
2011-06-02T06:46:59  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, what does "" symbols mean in visualizer after player names?

2011-06-02T06:50:34  <Frontier> Ice_Harley: do you use the Java visualizer or the html one? Did you change your browser web site encoding to ASCII or something?
2011-06-02T06:51:20  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, no. Actually I see squares both in Opera and in Chrome
2011-06-02T06:52:35  <Frontier> maybe someone changed the php files... I'll check
2011-06-02T06:53:10  <Frontier> hmm seems to be working for me. You are on ... Mac? Linux?

2011-06-02T06:53:52  <Frontier> ah ok :p ... strange
2011-06-02T06:55:58  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, how i see it: http://imageshost.ru/photo/132778/id644883.html
2011-06-02T06:56:01  <Frontier> These are symbol characters not present in every font. Therefor the OS has to set up a chain of fallbacks. I had problems in Java with other symbols before, but found these to be working for me and others. Next time I boot into Windows Vista I'll veryfy that.
2011-06-02T06:57:13  <Frontier> Ice_Harley: You did not mod your Windows in any way that could have an effect on installed fonts?
2011-06-02T06:59:11  <Frontier> I'm just asking because I actually get a few bug reports where the problem is in the system/browser configuration. So I want to go sure before I pull my hair.
2011-06-02T06:59:43  <ohCrivens> frontier: thanks. Half expected that answer :)
2011-06-02T07:05:14  <Frontier> I'm trying to precompute some data for ants, but the algorithm runs for minutes in JavaScript. I don't think it is feasible even in pure C :p
2011-06-02T07:09:20  <Frontier> ah I just confused Chrome again with my constant tapping on 'reload'
2011-06-02T07:16:00  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, I have this problem on 3 windowses: at home, at work and at virtual machine
2011-06-02T07:16:51  <Frontier> that's bad. I'll have to replace them somehow then.
2011-06-02T07:17:20  <Ice_Harley> if it's just symbols - maybe use small pictures?
2011-06-02T07:18:11  <Frontier> Can you draw some for me?

2011-06-02T08:19:00  <antimatroid> another i would like is a game where there was one big world developers could write games for, think gta/ea skate/ etc. online all in the one world where everyone does their own thing
2011-06-02T08:19:44  <mcstar> different objecives with different players on the same map?
2011-06-02T08:19:48  <mcstar> t
2011-06-02T08:19:50  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-02T08:19:59  <antimatroid> hell, you already have that with something like ea skate
2011-06-02T08:20:03  <antimatroid> but completely different things :P
2011-06-02T08:20:12  <antimatroid> you're skating around a city while other players are jacking cars
2011-06-02T08:20:25  <mcstar> im only versed in coutner strike, half life, portal, and urban terror
2011-06-02T08:20:42  <antimatroid> the only time i ever really play video games is at friends on consoles
2011-06-02T08:20:54  <antimatroid> and we all used to skate (hardly any of us find the time anymore), so ea skate <3
2011-06-02T08:20:54  <mcstar> ive never used a console
2011-06-02T08:21:00  <mcstar> except linux console

2011-06-02T08:36:01  <antimatroid> apparently there was an earthquake here in tasmania once while i was alive
2011-06-02T08:36:04  <antimatroid> i slept through it though D:
2011-06-02T08:36:23  <antimatroid> and we don't get tsunamis in tasmania, we're surprising well protected from bad weather
2011-06-02T08:36:32  <antimatroid> considering the next stop is antarctica from the south
2011-06-02T08:36:33  <mcstar> i mmeant nz

2011-06-02T08:37:09  <antimatroid> nz was/is my backup plan for something like australia if we keep going to same way politically

2011-06-02T08:37:54  <antimatroid> australia is turning into a very big nanny country
2011-06-02T08:37:56  <mcstar> i know nothing about australian politics except that a woman is the president

2011-06-02T08:44:47  <mcstar> i read theres 1 billion ppl there approximately
2011-06-02T08:45:03  <mcstar> but australia is mainly desert
2011-06-02T08:45:25  <mcstar> you could easily solve your energy problems

2011-06-02T09:10:26  <janzert> Frontier: why is virtual memory the important one? it's a basically a measure of everything including shared libraries, swapped out pages, memmapped pages that have never been loaded and everything. whereas resident set size is the amount of actual physical memory used
2011-06-02T09:11:48  <janzert> in any case it has 17GB so even if the full virtual memory was in use it wouldn't be a problem
2011-06-02T09:12:01  <antimatroid> my only gripe with ubuntu so far is that it likes to slow down to an absolute crawl or just plain freeze too much

2011-06-02T10:20:35  <amstan> depends on your swap settings
2011-06-02T10:20:59  <amstan> but usually when you have a memory leak, it doesn't stop when the ram is full, so it'll continue writing to hd

2011-06-02T10:25:59  <mcstar> and if this is true, it might be better to disable swap altogether
2011-06-02T10:26:23  <amstan> that just makes the system freeze compleatelly
2011-06-02T10:26:29  <amstan> with swap you have a chance to kill stuff
2011-06-02T10:26:48  <mcstar> no linux kill the the process
2011-06-02T10:26:50  <mcstar> s
2011-06-02T10:27:01  <amstan> oh?
2011-06-02T10:27:14  <mcstar> i only have swap beacuse i hivernate
2011-06-02T10:27:17  <amstan> wouldn't the malloc calls just return -1?
2011-06-02T10:27:37  <mcstar> i read somewhere when i was researching this that it actually kills it
2011-06-02T10:27:52  <mcstar> never experienced it myself
2011-06-02T10:27:57  <mcstar> i think

2011-06-02T16:23:01  <bhasker> you can probably pull up the replay data from the source for the html page
2011-06-02T16:23:14  <bhasker> but you will have to convert the replay data into a stream format
2011-06-02T16:23:18  <bhasker> to play it back to your bot
2011-06-02T16:24:10  <locutus_> hi, i registered me at http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/ with the username locutus, but has not received my activation mail
2011-06-02T16:24:13  <aeter> which part of the html source contains the data?
2011-06-02T16:24:22  <Frontier> none :)
2011-06-02T16:24:36  <aeter> :)
2011-06-02T16:24:43  <Frontier> use /game/#### as url
2011-06-02T16:25:00  <bhasker> doh
2011-06-02T16:25:03  <locutus_> i have checked my junk folder and wait over half an hour, what can i do?
2011-06-02T16:25:06  <bhasker> it used to in planetwars
2011-06-02T16:25:09  <bhasker> locutus
2011-06-02T16:25:11  <bhasker> its not sending mail
2011-06-02T16:25:20  <bhasker> on the page there is an activation link at the bottom
2011-06-02T16:25:23  <Frontier> This will load the gzipped replay. It depends on your browser if it magically uncompresses it for you or you need a gzip program
2011-06-02T16:25:23  <bhasker> you need to click that
2011-06-02T16:25:28  <aeter> like, http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/game=11713?
2011-06-02T16:25:59  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/game/11713
2011-06-02T16:26:00  <Frontier> aeter, no like i wrote it, replace the = with / an
2011-06-02T16:26:01  <bhasker> like that
2011-06-02T16:26:14  <aeter> thanks :)
2011-06-02T16:26:43  <aeter> awesome
2011-06-02T16:26:51  <Frontier> I doubt you will get anything out of it though. Anyway the format is described in the wiki.
2011-06-02T16:27:57  <bhasker> it will be easier once mcleopold starts storing the stream format itself
2011-06-02T16:28:03  <bhasker> the engine outputs both
2011-06-02T16:28:09  <bhasker> then you could easily replay the stream to your bot
2011-06-02T16:28:35  <bhasker> replay to stream is harder
2011-06-02T16:28:58  <bhasker> frontier does the replay format store the moves per player too
2011-06-02T16:31:03  <Frontier> yes, they are there for each ant.

2011-06-02T16:32:35  <bhasker> but its not there yet

2011-06-02T16:33:37  <bhasker> locotus2 ors omething, main reason why my id on the beta server is hbhasker2 :)
2011-06-02T16:33:49  <bhasker> since this is a test server, the email module doesn't work
2011-06-02T16:33:56  <Frontier> bhasker: That would be helpful for debugging in deed. Uncompressed the stream is about 10x bigger than the sotrage format. That's why didn't store the stream.
2011-06-02T16:34:03  <bhasker> or rather is deliberately switched off
2011-06-02T16:34:26  <bhasker> yea i know its much larger,but without the stream and no easy way to go from replay to stream
2011-06-02T16:34:29  <bhasker> its harder to debug
2011-06-02T16:34:50  <locutus_> ok, i understand. the site is already closed. I create a new id. thank you for help

2011-06-02T20:12:34  <bhasker> i was wondering if we could get some stats per game per player in the replay
2011-06-02T20:12:38  <bhasker> like # of ants spawned
2011-06-02T20:12:42  <bhasker> #of ants died
2011-06-02T20:12:54  <bhasker> etc or is it possible to extrapolate that from the score?
2011-06-02T20:13:02  <bhasker> i meant extract rather*
2011-06-02T20:13:50  <olexs1> score should be (#ants_spawned + #enemies_killed), as i remember it
2011-06-02T20:14:45  <olexs1> from that and final ant amount of your bot alone, don't see how it's possible to get kills/deaths reliably
2011-06-02T20:14:48  <bhasker> what about ants lost though?
2011-06-02T20:14:59  <bhasker> ah nm
2011-06-02T20:15:00  <bhasker> doh
2011-06-02T20:15:10  <bhasker> ant spawed - final ant count
2011-06-02T20:15:15  <bhasker> not thinking
2011-06-02T20:15:45  <olexs1> but you'll need the enemies killed number, which you don't have on its own either
2011-06-02T20:15:46  <bhasker> olexs your bot is doing quite well
2011-06-02T20:15:54  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-06-02T20:16:19  <olexs1> I know, I'm actually surpsised. there are a few quite obvious flaws in him I'm simply to lazy to fix :)
2011-06-02T20:16:33  <bhasker> heh i have been tinkering with my bots exploration code
2011-06-02T20:16:33  <bhasker> se
2011-06-02T20:16:38  <bhasker> seems to do a bit better
2011-06-02T20:16:38  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=11874
2011-06-02T20:17:17  <bhasker> though its still a bit stupid retraces paths a lot
2011-06-02T20:17:22  <bhasker> especially at start of the game
2011-06-02T20:17:56  <olexs1> start is a bit slow-ish, but less chance single explorers will get killed
2011-06-02T20:19:07  <olexs1> midgame is interesting though, you and pimmie control fairly equal map parts and yet you get the upper hand having less ants to start with
2011-06-02T20:21:52  <olexs1> hm... my bot's aggression seems broken, a lot of situations where I surround an ant at safe distance but don't attack :)

2011-06-02T20:29:31  <bhasker> yea my bot does that too, sometimes it will cover the ant but just stay out of range:)
2011-06-02T20:30:13  <olexs1> it makes sense when having one ant of mine encounter an enemy, safety and such, but for some reason it seems also to apply for groups

2011-06-02T20:52:13  <a1k0n> he draws circles around the last ants
2011-06-02T20:53:16  <bhasker> ah suicide bots

2011-06-02T22:34:24  <McLeopold> no, I won't being doing anything on it tonight
2011-06-02T22:34:30  <janzert> ok
2011-06-02T22:34:41  <McLeopold> did you solve jails yet?
2011-06-02T22:35:02  <janzert> it would be great if you can confirm that it is the signal sending that is causing the slowdown

2011-06-02T22:35:27  <McLeopold> I'm not sure what my confirmation is worth, but I can look at it tomorrow
2011-06-02T22:35:49  <janzert> I think the way to solve will be to have a contest script that runs inside the jail as part of the sandbox and it will basically relay the stdio and send signals to the processes
2011-06-02T22:36:30  <janzert> basically I know that the worker sped up when I disabled signals being sent but I'm not sure if that was all of or even necessarily the main slowdown
2011-06-02T22:37:00  <janzert> but yeah, I don't have any time to work on it tonight anyway
2011-06-02T22:37:05  <McLeopold> tomorrow, let's get all the languages installed outside the jail, then we can have 3 comparisons
