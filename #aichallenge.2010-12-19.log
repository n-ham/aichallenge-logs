2010-12-19T00:00:05  <antimatroid> Frontier: can i get a copy of the visualiser that i can pass strings into of that format some time?
2010-12-19T00:00:12  <antimatroid> then i can really start to debug teh engine
2010-12-19T00:00:15  <antimatroid> semantic wise
2010-12-19T00:08:20  <Frontier> antimatroid: hmm... you will need to copy and paste the strings into the wep page.
2010-12-19T00:09:03  <antimatroid> that would be fine :P
2010-12-19T00:09:33  <Frontier> ok, I'm just now starting to adopt the new format, as I was unsure how much will change
2010-12-19T00:10:30  <antimatroid> yeah, that's cool

2010-12-19T00:28:28  <Frontier> btw, does maxTurns refer to the maximum like in PlanetWars (200) or the number of turns really played == number of "go"s?
2010-12-19T00:29:02  <antimatroid1> maximum number of turns in the game, you will receive that +1 goes
2010-12-19T00:29:04  <antimatroid1> max
2010-12-19T00:29:18  <antimatroid1> go's*
2010-12-19T00:31:24  <Frontier> ok
2010-12-19T00:46:44  <antimatroid1> i'm installing a future cop lapd demo
2010-12-19T00:46:47  <antimatroid1> i miss it so much
2010-12-19T00:46:53  <antimatroid1> best playstation game ever
2010-12-19T00:49:38  <antimatroid1> lol, except it only runs in windows 95
2010-12-19T00:49:40  <antimatroid1> lame
2010-12-19T00:51:05  <antimatroid1> fixed, life complete!
2010-12-19T00:55:14  <Frontier> :p
2010-12-19T01:14:07  <antimatroid1> ahh, nostalgia overlaod
2010-12-19T01:22:24  <Zannick> wait, if a player receives a go, they output a turn, right?
2010-12-19T01:22:48  <Zannick> you should receive n "go"s for a max of n turns
2010-12-19T01:25:24  <antimatroid1> Zannick: i just send a palyer go when i've finished sending them new info and expect them to send go back when they've finished sending me moves
2010-12-19T01:25:35  <antimatroid1> i also send each bot "fin" once the game is over
2010-12-19T01:26:23  <sigh> because "finish" would be wasting characters!
2010-12-19T01:26:29  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-12-19T01:26:55  <antimatroid1> my bot usually just checks the first letter of the string anyway
2010-12-19T01:27:36  <antimatroid1> we could allow ants to stack , but i think it makes it harder for people to deal with
2010-12-19T01:27:57  <Zannick> right, right, but sending n+1 go's to the player when they can take only n turns is kinda silly
2010-12-19T01:28:06  <Zannick> maybe you meant n go's plus a fin? :)
2010-12-19T01:28:19  <antimatroid1> i have a "turn 0"
2010-12-19T01:28:25  <antimatroid1> where i send game parameters to the player
2010-12-19T01:28:34  <antimatroid1> like dimensions, view radius, max turns etc.
2010-12-19T01:28:41  <antimatroid1> that way people can't say they hard coded things like that
2010-12-19T01:29:09  <Zannick> and you say "go" after that? before the actual first turn?
2010-12-19T01:29:42  <Zannick> also i disagree with the use of max turns to mean max turn number rather than maximum number of turns
2010-12-19T01:29:51  <antimatroid1> yes, because once you receive the start parameters and "go", you have 3 seconds to set up and return "go" again
2010-12-19T01:30:03  <Zannick> ah, the ready signal
2010-12-19T01:30:22  <antimatroid1> maxTurns is the maximum number of turns the game can have
2010-12-19T01:30:42  <antimatroid1> ie. at the end of turn maxTurns, the game will be called off and the player with the most ants wins
2010-12-19T01:30:47  <Zannick> right, but len([0, 1, ..., n]) is n+1
2010-12-19T01:30:56  <antimatroid1> yes, but turn 0 isn't really a turn
2010-12-19T01:30:58  <antimatroid1> it's setting up
2010-12-19T01:31:02  <Zannick> oh, right
2010-12-19T01:31:09  <Zannick> see you have me all confused :P
2010-12-19T01:31:22  <antimatroid1> i think frontier and i are on the same page
2010-12-19T01:31:33  <antimatroid1> once we have game strings playing, i'll clean everything up and post
2010-12-19T01:31:43  <sigh> Zannick: them math majors be using fancy maths tricks :P
2010-12-19T01:31:49  <antimatroid1> but atm we are changing so much that i think posting would confuse people later
2010-12-19T01:31:52  <Zannick> sigh: i'm a math major!
2010-12-19T01:31:55  <sigh> ahaha
2010-12-19T01:31:59  <antimatroid1> there are no fancy math tricks
2010-12-19T01:32:25  <antimatroid1> Zannick: did you ever play future cop lapd?
2010-12-19T01:32:30  <antimatroid1> there must be someone else out there
2010-12-19T01:32:38  <Zannick> nope
2010-12-19T01:34:19  <antimatroid1> are there any non-math majors in here? :P
2010-12-19T01:34:24  <sigh> me!
2010-12-19T01:34:28  <antimatroid1> you didn't do maths?
2010-12-19T01:34:31  <sigh> no
2010-12-19T01:34:32  <Zannick> i'm also a cs major :P
2010-12-19T01:34:49  <antimatroid1> Zannick: so did i (altthough barely), and economics :)
2010-12-19T01:35:05  <Zannick> that was my primary major

2010-12-19T02:23:27  <antimatroid1> Frontier: is that one of my maps? it's not getting base locations right
2010-12-19T02:24:05  <Frontier> what happened? off by one?
2010-12-19T02:24:54  <antimatroid1> wait, dw
2010-12-19T02:24:59  <antimatroid1> i found a bug already though
2010-12-19T02:25:17  <antimatroid1> but that isn't going to change anything for you
2010-12-19T02:25:25  <Frontier> did you mix up x/y and row/column?
2010-12-19T02:25:27  <antimatroid1> the bases should be where then 9's are
2010-12-19T02:26:20  <antimatroid1> oh, wait, i do grid[row][col]
2010-12-19T02:26:28  <antimatroid1> i think you plotted the bases [col][row]
2010-12-19T02:26:29  <Frontier> but... they aren't ^^. Look at the coordinates to the right.
2010-12-19T02:26:44  <Frontier> I did, as per the specs :)
2010-12-19T02:27:09  <antimatroid1> oh yes, you did, can you change that easily?
2010-12-19T02:27:18  <Frontier> no problem
2010-12-19T02:27:19  <antimatroid1> otherwise i can change it easily, but i prefer indexing like matrixes
2010-12-19T02:27:40  <antimatroid1> also, with grain numbers on home base
2010-12-19T02:28:02  <antimatroid1> i need to update that value for you when spawning an ant (which i'm not now), didn't you want that number non-changing though?
2010-12-19T02:28:42  <Frontier> no i want it to change, just not display it on the map
2010-12-19T02:29:00  <Frontier> i have no side panel yet so it is currently hidden
2010-12-19T02:30:35  <Frontier> do your ants dispose random amounts of grain on random locations of the map?
2010-12-19T02:30:44  <Frontier> otherwise i have a bug already
2010-12-19T02:31:21  <antimatroid1> an ant can deposit up to its full harvest on a move
2010-12-19T02:31:42  <antimatroid1> if ants crash and no ant survives, their combined harvest turns into harvestable grains
2010-12-19T02:31:51  <antimatroid1> and i could have bugs too :)
2010-12-19T02:32:56  <antimatroid1> Frontier: http://pastebin.com/6esqitMw
2010-12-19T02:33:08  <antimatroid1> run that through, and you'll see the home squares go down each turn when spawning
2010-12-19T02:35:19  <antimatroid1> i'm not sending you updated grains when harvesting there either, coming right up
2010-12-19T02:37:52  <antimatroid1> http://pastebin.com/juWz1dcK
2010-12-19T02:39:05  <antimatroid1> Frontier: i wonder if you might slow down each of your turns :)
2010-12-19T02:39:15  <antimatroid1> also, thanks for the home base change :D
2010-12-19T02:46:05  <antimatroid1> Frontier: i see that random appearing of grains, i think it's the bot depositing them there
2010-12-19T02:46:26  <antimatroid1> i think the starter bot is moving an ant there, then making the deposit for the other ant afterwards, thinking there is an ant to deposit too

2010-12-19T02:52:07  <antimatroid1> what is it now?
2010-12-19T02:52:09  <antimatroid1> maybe double it
2010-12-19T02:52:27  <Frontier> 500ms -> 1000ms
2010-12-19T02:52:41  <antimatroid1> what it is now would be nice later once people can go back through the moves step by step
2010-12-19T02:52:51  <antimatroid1> but for the moment might make it easier to see what happens once ants are on the board
2010-12-19T03:11:10  <Frontier> Yo can see ants spawn now
2010-12-19T03:12:35  <antimatroid1> awesome, i just changed ants to walk more randomly
2010-12-19T03:12:42  <antimatroid1> i'll make a longer game string and post it
2010-12-19T03:13:08  <antimatroid1> oh, still no ants? :P

2010-12-19T03:17:09  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i have some kind of bug somewhere
2010-12-19T03:17:16  <antimatroid1> i have ants popping up where they shouldn't be

2010-12-19T04:28:58  <antimatroid1> Frontier: http://pastebin.com/c78We9zS
2010-12-19T04:30:33  <Frontier> take a look, it works. the only problem is several updates to the same object in the same turn
2010-12-19T04:31:18  <antimatroid1> you have to have several updates in the same turn
2010-12-19T04:31:24  <Frontier> For example when there is a deposit action and a spawn on the base I get two updates for that turn, which isn't working as you expect
2010-12-19T04:31:24  <antimatroid1> but this is perfect for the moment
2010-12-19T04:32:21  <antimatroid1> hmm yeah okay
2010-12-19T04:32:42  <antimatroid1> i'll do a longer game so hopefully some fights get going
2010-12-19T04:32:50  <Frontier> :)
2010-12-19T04:33:10  <antimatroid1> grain and hp counts don't change atm do they?

2010-12-19T04:34:12  <Frontier> they do change
2010-12-19T04:34:36  <antimatroid1> i haven't seen the harvest change when an ant makes a harvest
2010-12-19T04:35:23  <Frontier> it works on my machine. I think the script is in your browser cache

2010-12-19T04:36:56  <antimatroid1> i'm using up 800mb with the engine and both bots after 170 turns
2010-12-19T04:36:57  <Frontier> lol there is a red ant with 1hp and "NaN" harvest
2010-12-19T04:37:01  <Frontier> wow
2010-12-19T04:37:18  <antimatroid1> that'll be my bad :)
2010-12-19T04:37:31  <antimatroid1> i can use the site now to work these issues out tonight though
2010-12-19T04:37:34  <antimatroid1> i couldn't see such info before
2010-12-19T04:38:24  <Frontier> I may have a big problem with the fusions... they do really weird stuff to my visualizer at the moment
2010-12-19T04:38:57  <antimatroid1> i may have screwed up how i'm doing it

2010-12-19T04:43:07  <antimatroid1> i have an idea for how to stop them bunching up around the home base so much
2010-12-19T04:43:34  <antimatroid1> atm the firt time i enter a square i add a direction going backwards to follow home once harvesting
2010-12-19T04:43:47  <antimatroid1> i'll do something similar to heading to the outer regions of unvisisted teritory

2010-12-19T05:55:03  <Frontier> You said the number maxTurns relates to the number of "go"s iirc. I'll fix the coordinates...
2010-12-19T06:02:47  <antimatroid1> Frontier: that is an upper bound on the number of turns and therefore an upper bound on the number of goes
2010-12-19T06:03:04  <antimatroid1> but if an ant lands on an enemies home base or a player runs out of ants, the game ends before then

2010-12-19T06:21:13  <delt0r_> Cool... I just worked out how to avoid floats with a "rts" with simple integers and having some cool "physics"
2010-12-19T06:21:19  <delt0r_> not sure how folks feel about having to work out how to "fly" your units before you can be tactical however
2010-12-19T06:21:23  <delt0r_> Also
2010-12-19T06:21:54  <delt0r_> There was a game where you designed space ships that was popular in the 70s-80s (table top game)
2010-12-19T06:22:29  <delt0r_> One year a computer entry won it... does anyone remember the name of the game?
2010-12-19T06:22:42  <delt0r_> space combat followed ship design
2010-12-19T06:22:46  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: i'd be down :)

2010-12-19T06:24:54  <antimatroid1> the wrapping is broken on the gui atm, but you get the picture
2010-12-19T06:25:50  <Frontier> it is no longer broken
2010-12-19T06:25:52  <delt0r_> doesn't run on my FF

2010-12-19T06:26:45  <antimatroid1> yay
2010-12-19T06:26:55  <antimatroid1> frontier: i also had a successful fight in that example above
2010-12-19T06:27:39  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: works in my chrome

2010-12-19T06:28:22  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: so by "i'd be down" --having to learn to fly is ok?
2010-12-19T06:28:32  <antimatroid1> yes
2010-12-19T06:28:42  <antimatroid1> can it be 3d flying?

2010-12-19T06:35:15  <antimatroid1> there are still lots of bugs

2010-12-19T06:36:31  <antimatroid1> it works for me if i paste it right after i load the page
2010-12-19T06:36:36  <antimatroid1> otherwise it stops working
2010-12-19T06:37:13  <sigh> ok, yeah... got it
2010-12-19T06:37:14  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: Sorry doing some surfing. No, not 3d --just 2d...
2010-12-19T06:37:41  <delt0r_> but its "non holomorphic" or whatever its called
2010-12-19T06:37:54  <delt0r_> ie turn radius is a function of speed
2010-12-19T06:38:19  <delt0r_> but you can turn on the spot... but "fastest" route is a very hard problem
2010-12-19T06:38:22  <antimatroid1> oh god, don't remind me of caculus of variations
2010-12-19T06:38:29  <delt0r_> oh yea
2010-12-19T06:38:32  <delt0r_> and then some
2010-12-19T06:38:44  <antimatroid1> yeah, bring on multiplayer optimal control theory
2010-12-19T06:38:59  <antimatroid1> i'm down, but i may be in a minority
2010-12-19T06:39:00  <delt0r_> but because all "terrain" is passable, the idea is that suboptimal is good enough
2010-12-19T06:39:06  <delt0r_> and strat is more important
2010-12-19T06:39:39  <antimatroid1> you could do a 2d fly the copter like game
2010-12-19T06:39:45  <delt0r_> so a simple stop, turn, move, stop will work
2010-12-19T06:39:47  <antimatroid1> where it was symmetric top to bottom and no gravity
2010-12-19T06:40:05  <delt0r_> its space based
2010-12-19T06:40:15  <delt0r_> in a nubular
2010-12-19T06:40:19  <delt0r_> nebular
2010-12-19T06:40:29  <antimatroid1> sigh: i'll make you a longer game :)
2010-12-19T06:40:32  <delt0r_> In fact I will now name the game Nebular
2010-12-19T06:40:58  <sigh> antimatroid1: looks interesting... defending home base might be difficult
2010-12-19T06:41:12  <delt0r_> now i have the int math defined, i should be able to finish it today...
2010-12-19T06:41:18  <sigh> need better bots to see what the dynamics are like
2010-12-19T06:41:21  <delt0r_> then we have a non ant option ;)
2010-12-19T06:41:25  <delt0r_> :P
2010-12-19T06:41:40  <sigh> int math?
2010-12-19T06:43:19  <antimatroid1> sigh: i expect to have home bases forced further apart than that later
2010-12-19T06:44:26  <sigh> sure... but still, if it takes too many resources to defend then I don't think that's good for game play
2010-12-19T06:44:50  <sigh> it will be like close maps in planet wars where most of the units are tied up defending hom

2010-12-19T06:48:21  <antimatroid1> i don't expect it to be very easy to intrude the enemies base
2010-12-19T06:48:21  <delt0r_> sigh: Floats between langs can give different rounding behavour... resulting in diverging "game engines"
2010-12-19T06:48:37  <delt0r_> I wanted to avoid that... esp if you need "trig"
2010-12-19T06:48:40  <sigh> ah, so you are doing fixed point?
2010-12-19T06:48:44  <delt0r_> yep
2010-12-19T06:49:26  <delt0r_> forcing IEEE is not good enough since you need the math libs to give 2 ulps or so... and C/C++ does not do this out of the box
2010-12-19T06:49:59  <delt0r_> also x86 have odd rounding behavoir if you don't force IEEE at compile time
2010-12-19T06:50:25  <Frontier> its working now, there was another firefox bug, but it's working
2010-12-19T06:50:52  <sigh> I've never had to deal with floating point details much :)

2010-12-19T07:11:23  <antimatroid1> i was thinking we might need to limit the number of grains so bots might even have a chance at getting near the enemies base
2010-12-19T07:12:05  <sigh> i'm probably wrong... was just a guess
2010-12-19T07:12:13  <sigh> not like i've played the game :P
2010-12-19T07:12:34  <antimatroid1> nobody has :P
2010-12-19T07:16:49  <Frontier> btw antimatroid, you could send an U id 0 harvest before an ant dies. Then the HP would actually drop to 0 on screen
2010-12-19T07:21:34  <antimatroid1> Frontier: yeah i saw that, hadn't got around to changing it yet :)
2010-12-19T07:23:18  <antimatroid1> i'm also trying to clean up a bit
2010-12-19T07:23:39  <antimatroid1> there is one thing, currently if ant ant dies from an attack, it drops its harvest before an ant can come on and get it
2010-12-19T07:23:46  <antimatroid1> an ant*
2010-12-19T07:38:15  <Frontier> reload the page :)
2010-12-19T07:40:29  <antimatroid1> slower?
2010-12-19T07:40:31  <antimatroid1> cheers
2010-12-19T07:43:31  <antimatroid1> Frontier: what's with the fight swapping?
2010-12-19T07:43:50  <antimatroid1> an ant can be fought from more than one direction, although it does look cool
2010-12-19T07:49:58  <Frontier> what can I do? I only animate the attacks, not the defenses :p
2010-12-19T07:50:57  <antimatroid1> but do they make it back to their square by the end of the turn?
2010-12-19T07:51:31  <antimatroid1> and it probably doens't make sense if an ant goes off to attack another while a third comes in to attack to first
2010-12-19T07:53:19  <Frontier> they return to their squares :)
2010-12-19T07:53:27  <antimatroid1> that's cool then :D
2010-12-19T07:54:59  <antimatroid1> how hard would a back/forward button be?
2010-12-19T07:57:30  <Frontier> not that hard i guess

2010-12-19T08:37:49  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: i'm wondering if we should each create a separate ant thread at some point with the different specs
2010-12-19T08:38:38  <antimatroid1> i do miss the idea of each ant for itself, but i really like the home bases and fear the other may just end up adding the start to being pattern match until working out who/where everyone is

2010-12-19T10:50:58  <delt0r_> boring
2010-12-19T10:51:17  <antimatroid1> how?
2010-12-19T10:51:24  <antimatroid1> there's plenty of strategy to this game
2010-12-19T10:52:01  <delt0r_> there is a lot of strategy in go too
2010-12-19T10:52:06  <delt0r_> but go is boring too
2010-12-19T10:52:36  <antimatroid1> what do you like? :P
2010-12-19T10:52:50  <delt0r_> I remain unconqinced that there is that much stratagy with current maps
2010-12-19T10:52:55  <delt0r_> unconviced
2010-12-19T10:53:12  <delt0r_> well I always said... i didn't have a better idea.
2010-12-19T10:53:27  <delt0r_> however my mini RTS is comming along nicely...
2010-12-19T10:53:48  <delt0r_> should be out tonight or tomorrow morning
2010-12-19T10:54:09  <antimatroid1> i'm going to bed shortly
2010-12-19T10:54:14  <antimatroid1> so hopefully when i wake up :D
2010-12-19T10:55:25  <delt0r_> amstan: In my next attempt at a suggestion, I am doing a small space based RTS game..however folks with need to "learn to fly" there ships... its simple physics however
2010-12-19T10:55:43  <delt0r_> would this be a problem... ie making it harder for beginners...
2010-12-19T10:56:05  <delt0r_> just wondering what the organizers general feeling would be?
2010-12-19T10:56:11  <amstan> delt0r_: there's issues though, you need time real time data then
2010-12-19T10:56:17  <amstan> if there's physics involved
2010-12-19T10:56:24  <amstan> unless you want to make it based on steps again
2010-12-19T10:56:25  <delt0r_> Oh i have worked it all out
2010-12-19T10:56:30  <delt0r_> with integer math...
2010-12-19T10:56:50  <delt0r_> control the round off to not be "floating point dependant"
2010-12-19T10:57:04  <delt0r_> well defined steps per turn etc
2010-12-19T10:57:21  <delt0r_> its just not as simple as "you can move up to 5 squares"
2010-12-19T10:58:21  <delt0r_> By real time i really mean simultaneous turns.. Like planet wars --its how its all done with real RTS games anyway
2010-12-19T10:59:01  <antimatroid1> ants is simultaneous turns :P
2010-12-19T10:59:27  <antimatroid1> i really don't get what people mean by rts
2010-12-19T10:59:43  <delt0r_> Dune 2
2010-12-19T10:59:49  <delt0r_> thats the deffinition...
2010-12-19T10:59:56  <delt0r_> the rest are clones ;)
2010-12-19T11:00:12  <Frontier> warcraft was a clone? oh...
2010-12-19T11:00:19  <delt0r_> dam right...
2010-12-19T11:00:40  <delt0r_> dune 2 was in fact the 2nd RTS game to hit the market
2010-12-19T11:00:54  <delt0r_> but still the definitive game..
2010-12-19T11:01:01  <delt0r_> 3 different sides
2010-12-19T11:01:11  <delt0r_> different units in each
2010-12-19T11:01:26  <delt0r_> you could capture sand worms and get them to do your bidding
2010-12-19T11:01:53  <delt0r_> or run over foot solders with haversters, hear them get crushed and scream out in pain
2010-12-19T11:02:30  <delt0r_> Sonic tanks for the win
2010-12-19T11:05:42  <Frontier> delt0r_: Dune 2 is a clone: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_Zwei
2010-12-19T11:07:00  <delt0r_> No--that was first (as stated above)... but dune 2 awesomeness left it so far behind that nobody care about the poor imitation on a console
2010-12-19T11:07:18  <delt0r_> just as no one really cares about RTS on consoles to this day
2010-12-19T11:07:23  <delt0r_> :P
2010-12-19T11:13:56  <Frontier> well, the rts genre has slowly evolved away from obvious square grids and fixed turn rates. when someone says rts I don't think of any game that usually runs in turns of different length up to 1 second or 5 minutes
2010-12-19T11:14:15  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@112.134.122.128> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2010-12-19T11:14:59  <Frontier> An RTS would be if you space simulator ran continuosly and the bots would merely throw in some new command now and then when they see fit
2010-12-19T11:15:18  <Naktibalda> antimatroid1: you should play more games :)
2010-12-19T11:15:31  <delt0r_> yea
2010-12-19T11:15:57  <Frontier> like "fire button down" "fire button up" "thruster on"...
2010-12-19T11:16:03  <delt0r_> RTS games will run at a game "turn" rate of about 5 turns per sec
2010-12-19T11:16:28  <delt0r_> if can click 30 time before your turn is up... good for you...
2010-12-19T11:16:30  <delt0r_> if not
2010-12-19T11:16:31  <delt0r_> well
2010-12-19T11:17:00  <Frontier> i don't believe you :p. I think I get a better response time than 0-200 ms from some RTS
2010-12-19T11:17:07  <delt0r_> but its really is just simulations turns... we you don't "time out"
2010-12-19T11:17:19  <delt0r_> Not thats the ping
2010-12-19T11:17:25  <antimatroid1> Naktibalda: not much of a video game player :P
2010-12-19T11:17:28  <delt0r_> its not the same thing
2010-12-19T11:17:36  <Epona> video games are evil
2010-12-19T11:17:51  <delt0r_> As someone who is coding and have worked with RTS game code bases --trust me
2010-12-19T11:18:09  <Frontier> delt0r_: I didn't take online games into account actually. I meant the response time on a local game when I order a unit to move
2010-12-19T11:18:11  <Naktibalda> games like Civilization and UFO have real turns, where a player has to click End turn
2010-12-19T11:18:27  <delt0r_> Typically you cheat a bit and make local units move and trust that thing sync.. gives the feel of responsivness
2010-12-19T11:18:31  <Epona> civilization one was pretty cool
2010-12-19T11:18:38  <Epona> soooo much time wasted
2010-12-19T11:19:23  * Naktibalda was surprized today that B&M sells some kind of sega mega drive console for 30 pounds
2010-12-19T11:19:30  <delt0r_> of course you can up the game turn rate to say 10 games turns per sec... but much higher is a waste of time.. try SC or SC2 and you will really see
2010-12-19T11:22:43  <Frontier> aren't there games that use a polygon mesh for the maps that isn't aligned in a way that you could say a unit will hit a no-walk boundary exactly at a 200ms interval?
2010-12-19T11:22:53  <delt0r_> no
2010-12-19T11:23:18  <delt0r_> Most really are grids... with pretty rough collison detection
2010-12-19T11:23:24  <Frontier> but units can use any angle to walk/drive around
2010-12-19T11:23:40  <delt0r_> most games they really can't
2010-12-19T11:24:01  <delt0r_> this is less so in newer games where the grid is finer than the unit size
2010-12-19T11:24:07  <delt0r_> but its still the case
2010-12-19T11:25:20  <Frontier> i wont by your rts games delt0r_. They are too restricted -.-
2010-12-19T11:25:46  <delt0r_> My game is less restrictive that anything else on the market
2010-12-19T11:25:48  <Frontier> I'll play Company of Heroes insteas
2010-12-19T11:26:00  <delt0r_> Thats totally uses a grid
2010-12-19T11:26:03  <antimatroid1> bah i give up for tonight
2010-12-19T11:26:05  <Frontier> Oo
2010-12-19T11:26:13  <delt0r_> if you can't see that no wonder you think other don't
2010-12-19T11:26:23  <delt0r_> its a fine grid..to be sure
2010-12-19T11:26:29  <delt0r_> but its a gird
2010-12-19T11:26:39  <delt0r_> also its very small scale
2010-12-19T11:26:57  <delt0r_> 10k units np
2010-12-19T11:27:05  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@112.134.120.224> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-19T11:27:07  <delt0r_> 100km x 100km maps np
2010-12-19T11:27:46  <Frontier> http://www.restorerestartquit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/coh.jpg <- i don't see a grid :(
2010-12-19T11:28:00  <delt0r_> you see in there movement...
2010-12-19T11:28:35  <delt0r_> you don't draw the bloody grid
2010-12-19T11:28:42  <antimatroid1> haha
2010-12-19T11:29:11  <Frontier> lol, the movement is not restricted in any way I would have noticed while playing
2010-12-19T11:29:55  <delt0r_> well we do try to hide it... but CoH does have sloppy collision detection... so they can get away with sloppy representation...
2010-12-19T11:30:07  <delt0r_> ie internal state != rendering state
2010-12-19T11:30:52  <delt0r_> its the most common trick to get repsonsivness and feel while not needing the complexity underneath
2010-12-19T11:31:54  <Frontier> You can place the sand sacks in any angle and the units follow it's outlines iirc... when i start up windows some time again, i'll search for your grid and 200ms turns :)
2010-12-19T11:32:07  <delt0r_> lolololololo
2010-12-19T11:32:23  <delt0r_> what part of trick don't you understand
2010-12-19T11:32:29  <delt0r_> read some coding tuts on this
2010-12-19T11:32:33  <delt0r_> then you will see
2010-12-19T11:33:18  <Frontier> I have the theory that CoH uses an arbitary polygonal mesh for collisions and pathfinding
2010-12-19T11:33:27  <delt0r_> nope
2010-12-19T11:33:38  <delt0r_> unless you need a supercomputer to play
2010-12-19T11:34:23  <delt0r_> It may use a highly simplfied mesh however... so that the distiction between grid and mesh is merly simatics
2010-12-19T11:34:26  <delt0r_> simantics
2010-12-19T11:34:31  <delt0r_> semantics
2010-12-19T11:35:21  <delt0r_> full geometric algos are slow and memory intensive --CAD folks have spend a *lot* of effort on this
2010-12-19T11:35:33  <delt0r_> we know its pretty hard
2010-12-19T11:38:07  <Frontier> What do you understand by full geometry? The 'hull' of a sand bag wall is no more than a 6-8 sided 2D polygon.
2010-12-19T11:38:30  <delt0r_> and how many do you have on screen?
2010-12-19T11:38:56  <delt0r_> how many *graphics* fps... games use simplifcations that we don't notice... and even dirty hacks
2010-12-19T11:39:17  <delt0r_> things like z ordering so that small errors are not visable
2010-12-19T11:39:58  <delt0r_> I am not making things up... Do you really think they calculate where each foot should really be? no its a hack that looks good enough
2010-12-19T11:40:31  <delt0r_> This is well know in the rts
2010-12-19T11:40:41  <delt0r_> but CoH can be a slight exception...
2010-12-19T11:41:01  <delt0r_> Its more a squad game that real RTS in my books... i hate really small unit counts
2010-12-19T11:41:24  <delt0r_> so the engine can be  a hybrid between FPS and a rts
2010-12-19T11:41:41  <delt0r_> so AABX that sort of thing
2010-12-19T11:41:53  <Frontier> I don't believe they calculate where each foot really is, Half-Life 2 did that for the striders. But I think their engine doesn't use a grid and angles and positions are floating point
2010-12-19T11:42:37  <delt0r_> But what is on the screen is not what is used "out the back"
2010-12-19T11:43:12  <delt0r_> there is a big difference between floating point leg position (that uses hacky IK approximations) and
2010-12-19T11:43:18  <delt0r_> full engine fp
2010-12-19T11:43:41  <delt0r_> but FPS can get away with more since total unit count is typlically a few dozen

2010-12-19T14:00:22  <Mathnerd314> how long will the contest be? will you have another vacation mid-contest?
2010-12-19T14:00:35  <j3camero> Impossible to tell haha.
2010-12-19T14:00:48  <j3camero> But yeah I got really burnt out last one.
2010-12-19T14:01:01  <Mathnerd314> hmm, then I'm sorta with you.
2010-12-19T14:01:08  <j3camero> I had enough strength to get it out into the wild and launched, but then I was pretty much done.
2010-12-19T14:01:58  <j3camero> Luckily there is a much larger pool of developers since we went to open-source. That should help to reduce the ridiculous workload on people.
2010-12-19T14:02:26  <j3camero> I remember during Tron there were a few of us pulling all-nighters every night. It is a good thing though.
2010-12-19T14:03:29  <j3camero> Mathnerd314 what is your main area of interest? What do you like coding? Fave languages? Also, non-coding tasks?
2010-12-19T14:04:31  <Mathnerd314> well, I was going to work on the last contest, but then I kept ignoring it and writing a new PL instead. (implemented in Haskell, my fave language other than the one I'm writing)
2010-12-19T14:05:52  <j3camero> PL == programming language?
2010-12-19T14:05:56  <Mathnerd314> yeah.
2010-12-19T14:06:01  <Mathnerd314> my main interest is probably mathematical programming languages :p
2010-12-19T14:07:10  <j3camero> Hmmm interesting.
2010-12-19T14:07:21  <j3camero> I wonder if we could do something really awesome around that with the contest.
2010-12-19T14:08:20  <j3camero> You could see it being fun to program a bot in some sort of declarative way (math-like) instead of procedurally.
2010-12-19T14:09:26  <Mathnerd314> the problem is determining the winner

2010-12-19T16:05:46  <delt0r_> :)
2010-12-19T16:05:52  <j3camero> Would be nice to see a few different ideas before settling on how we want to arrange the rules of the game.
2010-12-19T16:05:53  <delt0r_> german keyboard
2010-12-19T16:05:59  <delt0r_> yea
2010-12-19T16:06:11  <delt0r_> that was the idea of my engine... try different things
2010-12-19T16:06:20  <delt0r_> not really to say... here is the thing
2010-12-19T16:06:41  <j3camero> Yep exactly.
2010-12-19T16:06:43  <delt0r_> also I am now writing a space based min RTS  as a suggestion as well
2010-12-19T16:06:49  <j3camero> Oooo
2010-12-19T16:06:53  <j3camero> 3D or 2D?
2010-12-19T16:06:56  <delt0r_> 2D
2010-12-19T16:07:01  <j3camero> Cool.
2010-12-19T16:07:13  <j3camero> 3D would be ridiculous. But somewhat fun. It could work.
2010-12-19T16:07:14  <delt0r_> will be hard enough for beginners as is
2010-12-19T16:07:27  <j3camero> True.
2010-12-19T16:07:44  <delt0r_> it incudes accleration etc.. so you would need to be able to "fly" your ships
2010-12-19T16:07:47  <j3camero> I am always tempted to produce really complicated games. I must remember that the target audience should be total beginners.
2010-12-19T16:07:51  <delt0r_> could make it too hard already
2010-12-19T16:08:29  <delt0r_> I think complicated is ok.. as long as a "starter pack" bot can still be simple
2010-12-19T16:08:46  <j3camero> Yes that's exactly right.
2010-12-19T16:09:20  <j3camero> The starter pack has to be simple, and there have to be at least three simple improvements to the starter pack that give a good boost in the rankings.
2010-12-19T16:09:46  <delt0r_> I would agree
2010-12-19T16:09:59  <j3camero> Do you have any visual output from your engine? It would be neat to see something.
2010-12-19T16:10:18  <delt0r_> My post included a simple visulizer
2010-12-19T16:10:26  <delt0r_> this is for the ants
2010-12-19T16:10:33  <j3camero> Yes
2010-12-19T16:10:44  <j3camero> Was yours the really cool-looking javascript one?
2010-12-19T16:10:48  <delt0r_> nope
2010-12-19T16:10:51  <delt0r_> the java one
2010-12-19T16:11:02  <j3camero> I will have to revisit.
2010-12-19T16:11:09  <delt0r_> looks like a cross word with numbers and dots
2010-12-19T16:12:50  <delt0r_> what lang do you use?
2010-12-19T16:13:27  <j3camero> I like Python for this sort of thing.
2010-12-19T16:13:54  <j3camero> I could make some sort of GUI...
2010-12-19T16:13:59  <delt0r_> Python is nice--quick to prototype
2010-12-19T16:14:21  <delt0r_> but i havn't done much with python

2010-12-19T16:22:12  <Zannick> i don't really think that's worth it
2010-12-19T16:22:28  <Zannick> you'd be asking people to stop using their ide and use yours
2010-12-19T16:23:15  <j3camero> We wouldn't force people to use the browser-based IDE. If you wanted to code on your own machine and zip it up and upload it manually, you could still do that. I have a feeling that many people would choose the browser IDE if we did it right.
2010-12-19T16:23:46  <j3camero> It would be the most useful for people who are total beginners.
2010-12-19T16:24:21  <j3camero> Instead of asking them to figure out how to set up a development environment on their computer (non-trivial for a beginner), they would have the option to "click here to start coding"
2010-12-19T16:37:46  <Zannick> maybe

2010-12-19T16:57:32  <antimatroid1> j3camero: also, you should put something on the main site about aiGameDev
2010-12-19T17:00:56  <Epona> thatd be pretty awesome

2010-12-19T17:02:20  <antimatroid1> then you have to defend
2010-12-19T17:02:47  <j3camero> I love that visualizer.
2010-12-19T17:02:58  <antimatroid1> so do i, thank frontier
2010-12-19T17:03:15  <j3camero> Whoever made that should become the visualizer guru for the next contest. I remember making a note of the forum name of the guy who made it.
2010-12-19T17:03:18  <j3camero> Frontier, yes.

2010-12-19T18:11:33  <delt0r_> its cool
2010-12-19T18:11:43  <delt0r_> its unfortunatly not so simple

2010-12-19T18:11:53  <delt0r_> I should simplifiy it
2010-12-19T18:12:05  <delt0r_> well its the units thing
2010-12-19T18:12:12  <delt0r_> I have 4 unit types already
2010-12-19T18:12:18  <delt0r_> should stick with one
2010-12-19T18:12:22  <delt0r_> or 2
2010-12-19T18:12:26  <delt0r_> then 3
2010-12-19T18:12:31  <delt0r_> etc
2010-12-19T18:12:31  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i kind of like the idea of harder and harder games
2010-12-19T18:12:45  <delt0r_> Well i don't want starter packs to be too hard
2010-12-19T18:13:03  <delt0r_> complex is fine... but a basic bot should be easy
2010-12-19T18:13:27  <delt0r_> but "flying" a ship is not that easy.. (well its not that hard either...)
2010-12-19T18:13:39  <antimatroid1> shouldn't be that hard for people

2010-12-19T18:15:47  <delt0r_> warp guns (aka arty ) needs to have zero speed to fire
2010-12-19T18:16:43  <delt0r_> there is a wild card "unit" id which means the unit will fire at the nearest thing

2010-12-19T21:56:03  <antimatroid1> i would expect if you do and an ant game was to be used then that would likely be an engine to release to people later, so it would probably be worth discussing with people what they want first
2010-12-19T21:56:19  <antimatroid1> particularly delt0r and i have two different incompatible specifications
2010-12-19T21:56:30  <antimatroid1> both have nice features that just don't go together
2010-12-19T21:57:15  <amstan> j3camero: so.. i do wanna work on tron
2010-12-19T21:57:26  <amstan> s/tron/next engine wtf is wrong with me, lol
2010-12-19T21:57:38  <amstan> j3camero: and i wanna program more
2010-12-19T21:57:50  <amstan> j3camero: also.. i hate toronto, found a place
2010-12-19T21:58:05  <amstan> j3camero: issue is that i'm going on vacation till 4th jan
2010-12-19T21:58:05  <antimatroid1> amstan: have you finished exams?
2010-12-19T21:58:12  <amstan> antimatroid1: tomorrow the last
2010-12-19T21:58:14  <amstan> then florida
2010-12-19T21:58:17  <antimatroid1> good luck :)
2010-12-19T21:58:30  <antimatroid1> also, i expect most people will be busy over the next week or two as well
2010-12-19T22:00:43  <j3camero> I am already here :-)
2010-12-19T22:00:49  <j3camero> Just wasn't paying attention.
2010-12-19T22:00:56  <amstan> j3camero: yep.. np
2010-12-19T22:01:00  <amstan> j3camero: i saw you went on here
2010-12-19T22:02:10  <j3camero> antimatroid1: I am not working on the "final engine" today, no. Just adding yet another engine to the brainstorming mix.
2010-12-19T22:03:31  <j3camero> I like the ants concept in general though.
2010-12-19T22:03:48  <j3camero> I think it could produce visualizations that are fun to watch.
2010-12-19T22:07:11  <antimatroid1> j3camero: my current engine sucks balls, so anything else would be good for the moment
2010-12-19T22:08:42  <antimatroid1> j3camero: http://codepad.org/c1zcUthc map gen
2010-12-19T22:09:05  <antimatroid1> there is a sample map at the bottom, the numbers at the top are the dimensions (square board) and locations of home bases
2010-12-19T22:09:30  <antimatroid1> http://pastebin.com/EV2q7cYb and that's the specification my engine etc. uses
2010-12-19T22:09:46  <antimatroid1> it would be good if you could at least use the format for passing strings to Frontiers visualiser
2010-12-19T22:11:18  <antimatroid1> amstan, j3camero: did either of you play future cop lapd on playsation?

2010-12-19T22:11:59  <antimatroid1> this is what my ant specification seems like to me
2010-12-19T22:12:57  <antimatroid1> your childhood was only ruined if you never has a snes
2010-12-19T22:13:58  <j3camero> That game looks sweet.
2010-12-19T22:14:26  <antimatroid1> there's a trial on download.com that lets you play skycaptain on precint assault mode
2010-12-19T22:14:36  <antimatroid1> i downlaoded it yesterday ;)

2010-12-19T22:15:56  <j3camero> Seems like ana elegant spec. That is good. We can't get too complicated.
2010-12-19T22:16:13  <antimatroid1> i put some thought into that
2010-12-19T22:16:34  <antimatroid1> one issue is when killing an ant, whether an ant moving onto that square should get the ants harvest before it is dropped
2010-12-19T22:16:41  <antimatroid1> i think they should, but it's harder to process
2010-12-19T22:16:51  <antimatroid1> killing an ant from a fight*

2010-12-19T22:18:14  <antimatroid1> i like the map generator, with the edges wrapped (equivalent to playing the game on the surface of a torus) then every non-wall square is reachable
2010-12-19T22:18:30  <antimatroid1> and you have no idea where their base might be at the start of the game
2010-12-19T22:18:46  <antimatroid1> well, other than it's within the given dimensions somewhere

2010-12-19T22:25:09  <antimatroid1> some people seem to be in favour of the engine just ignoring invalid moves, but i kind of like being told when i fuck up
2010-12-19T22:28:04  <antimatroid1> j3camero: i even have something for you to put in the strategy guide :P
2010-12-19T22:28:27  <j3camero> antimatroid1: ooo strategy guide
2010-12-19T22:28:40  <j3camero> It would be better than the advanced strategy guide I posted last time for sure :-)
2010-12-19T22:28:51  <amstan> j3camero: anyway.. don't start without me!!!
2010-12-19T22:29:12  <antimatroid1> atm i have the starter bot allocate each square a direction home, starting with 'X', then when an ant moves into a square, if direction home is X it sets it to go back into the square they just came from, that way any bot knows a (very inefficient) path home
2010-12-19T22:29:34  <antimatroid1> an update (but still inefficient) would be to have the bot update the direction if it's current path from home is shorter than the previous one
2010-12-19T22:30:07  <antimatroid1> realistically, people just want to paint the grid with where they can get, but i don't really want to put that in the starter bot, removes some of the fun
2010-12-19T22:31:01  <antimatroid1> if you paint from all sources at once with a queue, you also get shortest turns for any bot to reach a square
2010-12-19T22:31:07  <antimatroid1> sources == ants
2010-12-19T22:31:12  <j3camero> amstan: you got it man. Don't worry there will be tons to work on anyways haha.
2010-12-19T22:31:16  <antimatroid1> any == a
2010-12-19T22:31:37  <amstan> j3camero: oh.. another thing.. keep the protocol json
2010-12-19T22:31:43  <j3camero> amstan: I worked all day today at a coffee shop relatively near where you said you'd be working. It's a good spot for cranking out code.
2010-12-19T22:31:44  <amstan> j3camero: it'll make it easier for us in the future
2010-12-19T22:32:02  <j3camero> amstan: where are you living next term?
2010-12-19T22:32:39  <amstan> see gtalk for my place+workplace
2010-12-19T22:33:12  <antimatroid1> j3camero: i'm going to say it one more time, i really think you should put something on the planetwars website about aiGameDev, they've been handing out a lot of normally costly memberships to their site in the forums
2010-12-19T22:33:15  <antimatroid1> :)
2010-12-19T22:33:33  <amstan> j3camero: that too, they're rather dissapoint
2010-12-19T22:34:28  <antimatroid1> by the looks or it people are quite impressed with the site too
2010-12-19T22:34:38  <j3camero> That is good.
2010-12-19T22:34:42  <antimatroid1> and you may encourage other people to offer money/prizes
2010-12-19T22:35:47  <antimatroid1> i might also suggest sticking their name up on the next contests website without even requiring them offer a prize, although i suspect they may do the same thing again if they generate enough interest from it
2010-12-19T22:37:26  <amstan> antimatroid1: maybe you can be the next me!
2010-12-19T22:37:27  <j3camero> It's very nice what he is doing, yes. I am appreciative. However I'm kind of nervous dealing with the guy. He got pretty angry with me when I didn't get back to him quickly enough around the time I was starting my new job. That was my bad of course, I should have got back to him more quickly. But he got so angry that I just didn't feel like dealing with him anymore. That being said, I appreciate what he has done and I think it would be great to keep on c
2010-12-19T22:37:35  <antimatroid1> amstan: not a chance sorry :P
2010-12-19T22:37:39  <antimatroid1> i want to keep competing
2010-12-19T22:37:51  <amstan> antimatroid1: aww..
2010-12-19T22:38:11  <amstan> j3camero: oh lol, well, he is our first voluntary sponsor
2010-12-19T22:38:30  <amstan> perhaps i should talk to him, try to appologize
2010-12-19T22:38:35  <antimatroid1> j3camero: to be fair, i think he waited a while before getting angry, i probably would have responded similarly
2010-12-19T22:38:55  <amstan> i just need to know the protocol in this situations, so i can act in your behalf

2010-12-19T22:43:09  <amstan> send me his email if you want me to try to communicate with him
2010-12-19T22:43:49  <j3camero> I think we should just let it be for now.
2010-12-19T22:44:49  <amstan> ok
2010-12-19T22:45:09  <j3camero> There is an organizational problem here as well. Dealing with sponsors or any other activity that involves spending money or receiving money for the contest still has to go through me. I have managed to eliminate myself as a leadership chokepoint in most of the technical areas, but I'm still a bottleneck when it comes to sponsors and money matters.
2010-12-19T22:45:48  <j3camero> I really want to register a not-for-profit corporation or something to act as the purse of the contest. That would be a lot more flexible.
2010-12-19T22:46:56  <antimatroid1> you need to find an army of amstans
2010-12-19T22:47:00  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure he's sick of it
2010-12-19T22:47:18  <j3camero> who is sick of what?
2010-12-19T22:47:30  <amstan> being a people person
2010-12-19T22:47:32  <amstan> lol
2010-12-19T22:47:32  <antimatroid1> amstan and the boringness of the stuff he does
2010-12-19T22:47:42  <amstan> i wanna code already
2010-12-19T22:47:49  <j3camero> Yeah, we have had that conversation a few times.
2010-12-19T22:48:19  <j3camero> Yeah man when you start your next work term we'll hole up at the coffee shop after work and hammer out some code. :-)
2010-12-19T22:48:30  <amstan> sounds good
2010-12-19T22:48:41  <amstan> oh man.. can't wait
2010-12-19T22:49:27  <antimatroid1> i may have at least 2 other people likely to put a serious effort in next time where i live
2010-12-19T22:49:34  <j3camero> I think that the community is getting big enough at this point that we can enlist a bunch of mods from amongst the contestants themselves to act as information-disseminators.
2010-12-19T22:50:02  <j3camero> antimatroid1: do you mean as contestants or as staff? We could still use all the help we can get.
2010-12-19T22:50:13  <antimatroid1> contestants :P
2010-12-19T22:50:36  <antimatroid1> i don't mind doing something like that for you, but like stated a million times previously, anything that renders me ineligible to compete and i'm not willing
2010-12-19T22:51:05  <amstan> antimatroid1: i don't think there is anything, we're always going to relaxing the rules more and more from what i see
2010-12-19T22:52:06  <antimatroid1> what is a must is very clear game specifications, i don't mind generality, but it must be clear and the end game must not be a subset of what was defined to be allowed
2010-12-19T22:52:10  <j3camero> amstan has done a great job though. I see a lot of projects where the community gets really frustrated because they have trouble getting any information. Think about the frustration due to ambiguity in the rules last contest, times 100. amstan has realy been the driving force behind preventing that. He is always keeping the forums up to date so everybody knows what's going on mostly.
2010-12-19T22:52:48  <antimatroid1> yeah, all kudos to amstan, a lot of what he gets stuck doing is just tedious work, some of which really needs to be automated
2010-12-19T22:53:08  <j3camero> yes, agreed.
2010-12-19T22:53:34  <antimatroid1> if there was an army of people doing it instead of just him, it wouldn't be so bad on ech person either
2010-12-19T22:53:35  <amstan> thanks
2010-12-19T22:53:47  <antimatroid1> amstan: :)
2010-12-19T22:53:54  <amstan> well, the thing is.. this can be anyone, including contestants
2010-12-19T22:54:02  <j3camero> For sure.
2010-12-19T22:54:04  <amstan> they don't need to be disqualified in order to do this
2010-12-19T22:54:12  <amstan> antimatroid1: that's what i meant by you helping
2010-12-19T22:54:28  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure contestants should be able to edit other peoples profiles etc.
2010-12-19T22:55:40  <amstan> no.. not that
2010-12-19T22:55:46  <amstan> that should be the automated parts
2010-12-19T22:55:56  <amstan> i mean being a community person
2010-12-19T22:56:09  <j3camero> I think thats true now amstan. We can have the contestants themselves stepping up into leadership roles. The whole project is much more open now than it used to be. We will still have to be careful to be extremely clear about the difference between contestants and staff though. Very clear. We would look really stupid if somebody who appears to be an "insider" or "more than an ordinary contestant" wins the top prize.
2010-12-19T22:56:38  <amstan> we need to get a wiki, and write all that in there
2010-12-19T22:57:04  <j3camero> More than just writing it down though, it needs to be inherently obvious.
2010-12-19T22:57:25  <j3camero> Like, forum mods need to be marked as "contestant" or something.
2010-12-19T22:57:55  <antimatroid1> i actually didn't look in the forums much this contest
2010-12-19T22:57:58  <amstan> we also need to listen less to people like usernam
2010-12-19T22:58:04  <amstan> they're not the average..
2010-12-19T22:58:13  <antimatroid1> what did usernam say?
2010-12-19T22:58:14  <j3camero> Did anyone ever listen to him? :-)
2010-12-19T22:58:14  <amstan> and i don't think they're taken seriously by the average
2010-12-19T22:58:24  <amstan> j3camero: no, i was just affraid that they did
2010-12-19T22:58:25  <amstan> but no
2010-12-19T22:58:29  <j3camero> I see what you're saying amstan
2010-12-19T22:59:12  <amstan> it doesn't seem that there's a problem with people differentiating between insiders and contestants
2010-12-19T22:59:19  <amstan> but the problem is people not getting enough info
2010-12-19T22:59:26  <amstan> so i think we have to be more relaxed
2010-12-19T22:59:35  <antimatroid1> more clear*
2010-12-19T22:59:46  <antimatroid1> clarity is what people are unanimously asking for
2010-12-19T22:59:54  <amstan> yeah
2010-12-19T22:59:57  <antimatroid1> generality is fine, just not fuzzy
2010-12-19T23:00:19  <amstan> i also think that centralizing that info, having only one place for it, would make it clearer
2010-12-19T23:00:29  <sigh> I don't think there is an issue differentiating between insiders and contestants, either
2010-12-19T23:00:31  <j3camero> Nevertheless, the contest is starting to get some press from people who are more than just bloggers. Therefore we need to take steps to be as transparent and open as possible. All it takes is one headline that says "contest administrator takes first prize in own contest".
2010-12-19T23:00:43  <sigh> for example, no one made a fuss with antimatroid being the writer of the new maps
2010-12-19T23:00:51  <sigh> regardless of whether they liked the change :P
2010-12-19T23:00:57  <antimatroid1> i'm slightly biased on my preference towards these games, but i think the best thing the separates this contest from the other ai ones is the simultaneous game play
2010-12-19T23:01:00  <amstan> sigh: only usernam, lol
2010-12-19T23:01:09  <antimatroid1> it's gives much cooler fast paced games
2010-12-19T23:01:13  <sigh> :)
2010-12-19T23:01:16  <antimatroid1> ants is sort of in the middle
2010-12-19T23:01:31  <antimatroid1> sigh: some people made comments
2010-12-19T23:01:41  <antimatroid1> but they usually shut up when it was pointed out they could inspect the code
2010-12-19T23:01:42  <amstan> i agree, stuff is fun when it's more fast paced
2010-12-19T23:01:59  <antimatroid1> it gives* aha
2010-12-19T23:02:25  <sigh> yeah... perhaps it needs to be more clear that the code is available, and where it is
2010-12-19T23:02:42  <j3camero> Agreed yep.
2010-12-19T23:02:43  <antimatroid1> chuck a copy of all files on the start pack page
2010-12-19T23:02:43  <amstan> sigh: i can take care of that
2010-12-19T23:02:43  <antimatroid1> simple
2010-12-19T23:02:57  <antimatroid1> or a link at least
2010-12-19T23:03:02  <amstan> j3camero: i do believe a move to github will benefit us a lot
2010-12-19T23:03:11  <sigh> given this is a contest for programmers, I would put the link in the sidebar on the main page
2010-12-19T23:03:28  <j3camero> Yeah I think we should start out on github this time. That seemed to be pretty unanimous.
2010-12-19T23:03:40  <antimatroid1> no complaints here on that one :p
2010-12-19T23:03:41  <j3camero> sigh: yeah that's what I want to do.
2010-12-19T23:03:46  <amstan> j3camero: another issue is the naming..
2010-12-19T23:04:00  <amstan> j3camero: we should really decide ai challenge vs ai-contest or whatever other names
2010-12-19T23:04:34  <sigh> well, you've already got the ai-contest domain... I suggest you don't change that :P
2010-12-19T23:04:36  <antimatroid1> ai-contest.com is fairly well known now and easy to remember
2010-12-19T23:04:36  <j3camero> My idea around moving to open source was to blur the line between competitors and admins as much as possible. Ideally, the contest would be 100% run by the contestants themselves. We actually came pretty close to that this time around, with Janzert and danielvf doing so much work.
2010-12-19T23:05:02  <antimatroid1> there needs to be a very distinct line between administrator and contestant
2010-12-19T23:05:16  <j3camero> Yeah there does have to be that line.
2010-12-19T23:05:16  <antimatroid1> not so much between contributers/contestants
2010-12-19T23:05:44  <sigh> well, what I've been lead to understand is that only people not allowed to enter are those who have root access to the servers
2010-12-19T23:05:53  <amstan> sigh: yes
2010-12-19T23:05:56  <j3camero> Pretty much.
2010-12-19T23:06:04  <sigh> that's pretty clear, then
2010-12-19T23:06:06  <amstan> sigh: or any kind of admin accounts
2010-12-19T23:06:08  <antimatroid1> which would be admins yes?
2010-12-19T23:06:13  <amstan> antimatroid1: yes
2010-12-19T23:06:20  <antimatroid1> hence my comment :)
2010-12-19T23:06:24  <j3camero> Anybody who might reasonably be perceived to be an "official" or "insider", or who has an unfair advantage.
2010-12-19T23:06:34  <antimatroid1> what is an insider?
2010-12-19T23:06:42  <antimatroid1> i couldn't be more of an insider for ants the game
2010-12-19T23:06:52  <j3camero> Soembody who can speak on behalf of the contest, like amstan, as well.
2010-12-19T23:07:15  <j3camero> You are right antimatroid1, guess we'll have to disqualify you! :-P
2010-12-19T23:07:23  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-12-19T23:07:33  <amstan> we just have to be careful about the media, that's all
2010-12-19T23:07:54  <j3camero> No but that idea behind open sourcing was to let the contestants still compete, and also be involved in choosing and designing the game.

2010-12-19T23:07:59  <antimatroid1> i like the idea of every game being on a new map in future contests
2010-12-19T23:08:40  <sigh> depends on the game :P
2010-12-19T23:08:47  <amstan> antimatroid1: +1
2010-12-19T23:08:52  <antimatroid1> yes, tron no, planet wars yes
2010-12-19T23:09:00  <antimatroid1> with ants so far i would say yes
2010-12-19T23:09:01  <amstan> antimatroid1: it would help map distribution too
2010-12-19T23:09:07  <j3camero> amstan: I think I will choose to be very paranoid about transparency in the future, as I have been in the past. We really don't want somebody to make a credible accusation that the chosen winner is illegitimate. That would be terrible.
2010-12-19T23:09:12  <amstan> antimatroid1: include generator git hash, and seed
2010-12-19T23:09:56  <amstan> j3camero: what do you mean?
2010-12-19T23:10:16  <antimatroid1> there should be no reasonable argument that the winner was able to influence the outcome
2010-12-19T23:10:27  <antimatroid1> i'm probably starting to tread on thin ice there atm
2010-12-19T23:10:41  <antimatroid1> i can't be involved in the actual selection of the final game specs
2010-12-19T23:10:48  <antimatroid1> the ones i have are just how i think it could work
2010-12-19T23:11:29  <antimatroid1> unfairly influence*
2010-12-19T23:11:50  <antimatroid1> any contribution from a contestant needs to be approved by others for example, which is currently happening
2010-12-19T23:11:52  <j3camero> We want the contestants to step up into leadership roles to develop the community further. However, there's a danger that a contestant could become a de facto spokesman for the contest. This is a good thing I think, except that it looks dumb if this person goes on to win the contest. That would be like me winning the contest. It would just look dumb.
2010-12-19T23:12:39  <j3camero> antimatroid1: I think you're quite safe now. Don't sweat it.
2010-12-19T23:13:00  <antimatroid1> i know, but it's getting towards the line of what should and shouldn't be allowed from a contestant
2010-12-19T23:13:14  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't do it if i thought i would get deemed ineligible
2010-12-19T23:13:49  <j3camero> I think that designing the game and even writing the game engine itself is well within safe territory. I wouldn't sweat it.
2010-12-19T23:14:26  <antimatroid1> anyway, i'm off to get something for lunch
2010-12-19T23:14:41  <j3camero> Now if you were posting the final game choice in the forums under the Announcements topic, and your forum name was highlighted in a special color and such, then you would be getting close.
2010-12-19T23:15:30  <sigh> especially if that game choice was "best impersonation of antimatrioid"
2010-12-19T23:15:31  <amstan> afaik he's only playing with the problem
2010-12-19T23:15:35  <amstan> we might use his research
2010-12-19T23:15:48  <j3camero> Anyways. amstan I am going to keep dicking around with the ants game. It looks promising as a concept. We'll have to nail down some specific variant of the ants idea of course. In any case, we will lay down some serious code in January.
2010-12-19T23:15:59  <amstan> cool
2010-12-19T23:16:28  <j3camero> I was look at Django some more.
2010-12-19T23:16:50  <antimatroid1> j3camero: the alternative to my own does a half decent job at approximating each ant as a single process
2010-12-19T23:16:54  <amstan> good stuff eh?
2010-12-19T23:16:56  <antimatroid1> but it's incompatible with the home base idea
2010-12-19T23:17:18  <j3camero> I really like the i18n and l10n features. We might finally be able to offer the website in Russian, Polish, German, Spanish, French, etc. I'm sure we could find community members to help us with translation (you and I could do the french and romanian to get things started)
2010-12-19T23:17:34  <antimatroid1> it passes each ant relative information about what is around it, but if you have a home base you can just coordinate everything to that
2010-12-19T23:18:05  <antimatroid1> we need to find accoun a wife too
2010-12-19T23:18:14  <j3camero> antimatroid1: as a practical matter, I don't think we can do "one process per ant". It seems like that's just too many processes.
2010-12-19T23:19:03  <sigh> also makes the games longer, because the first phase of the game is synchronising with freindly ants
2010-12-19T23:19:07  <antimatroid1> j3camero: that's the point, all ants go in one process, but each ant gets passed relative information about what is around it, so if two ants are outside each others view, for all you know they could be right near each other or opposite sides of the map
2010-12-19T23:19:27  <antimatroid1> there is another option with ants moving onto the same square
2010-12-19T23:19:37  <j3camero> ohhhhh
2010-12-19T23:19:40  <j3camero> interesting
2010-12-19T23:19:52  <antimatroid1> i fuse and fight them to get one resulting ant, delt0r has those moves just not counting
2010-12-19T23:19:59  <j3camero> so the engine hides information about whats in between the ants, or their positions relative to one another
2010-12-19T23:20:08  <antimatroid1> yes
2010-12-19T23:20:14  <j3camero> I missed that
2010-12-19T23:20:25  <antimatroid1> each version ants have a view radius, so you can't see the whole map at the start
2010-12-19T23:20:39  <j3camero> Yeah mine too
2010-12-19T23:21:18  <antimatroid1> are you using that visualiser string format? that would probably make frontiers life a lot easier
2010-12-19T23:21:21  <antimatroid1> or at least something like it
2010-12-19T23:21:39  <j3camero> I haven't got that far yet.
2010-12-19T23:21:44  <j3camero> Will keep it in mind though.
2010-12-19T23:21:53  <j3camero> Is it XML or JSON or somesuch?
2010-12-19T23:21:57  <antimatroid1> don't worry so much about the bot input/output format, but it would be nice to be passed parameters at the start and given three seconds to set up, and also be sent "finish" instead of "go" when the game is over
2010-12-19T23:22:04  <antimatroid1> oh yeah, it's just text atm
2010-12-19T23:22:15  <antimatroid1> i think he had json set up though, talk to Frontier when you're working it out :)
2010-12-19T23:22:32  <j3camero> kk
2010-12-19T23:22:42  <j3camero> I was just playing with it today.
2010-12-19T23:22:44  <antimatroid1> cause that visualiser is awesome
2010-12-19T23:22:51  <j3camero> It really is
2010-12-19T23:22:51  <amstan> j3camero: we should try to keep it json, it would be nicer for the tools
2010-12-19T23:23:07  <amstan> and for adding any new stuff later
2010-12-19T23:23:10  <amstan> like turn count
2010-12-19T23:23:20  <j3camero> Why not XML? Isn't it more widely supported and such?
2010-12-19T23:23:36  <amstan> too much overhead
2010-12-19T23:23:42  <j3camero> As in, more languages have XML parsing ability in their default libraries.
2010-12-19T23:23:42  * antimatroid1 likes just plain input/output :(
2010-12-19T23:23:58  <amstan> json is the same, python does it just fine
2010-12-19T23:24:02  <amstan> js is native..
2010-12-19T23:24:10  <amstan> others have them too
2010-12-19T23:24:40  <antimatroid1> i think it's been checked that any languages seen used so far will have a json library available
2010-12-19T23:24:47  <j3camero> We could have a serious problem if people using windows have to go and install all kinds of 3rd party libraries just to get the starter package to work though.
2010-12-19T23:24:52  <antimatroid1> not sure whether all will be compatible with current server set up, but that's meant to change anyway
2010-12-19T23:25:15  <j3camero> Ideally the starter packages would be self-contained
2010-12-19T23:25:26  <antimatroid1> that's my issue, i like the bots being self contained
2010-12-19T23:25:35  <j3camero> Yeah.
2010-12-19T23:25:40  <antimatroid1> and it's really easy for me to handle input atm thanks to stringstreams
2010-12-19T23:25:52  <antimatroid1> not so much when i tried to handle input/output with processes
2010-12-19T23:26:05  <j3camero> I mean, if we use XML or JSON then people would need to install the correct libraries to get the C++ starter package to work. That would be annoying.
2010-12-19T23:26:32  <antimatroid1> would it be worth using json for everything but passing to and from bots?
2010-12-19T23:26:46  <j3camero> I dont really care that much.
2010-12-19T23:27:01  <antimatroid1> most people have seemed fine with the idea of json though
2010-12-19T23:27:08  <antimatroid1> so i don't mind that much
2010-12-19T23:27:12  <j3camero> Yep.
2010-12-19T23:27:17  <j3camero> JSON is pretty sweet.
2010-12-19T23:28:00  <j3camero> Okay I'm gonna hit the sack. Work tomorrow.
2010-12-19T23:28:11  <j3camero> Gotta make the financial markets ever more efficient.
2010-12-19T23:30:00  <j3camero> Oh is Marvin Minsky still alive?
2010-12-19T23:31:45  <amstan> lol

2010-12-19T23:47:47  <antimatroid1> blue sky up until i go outside to ride somewhere at which point it pours on me
2010-12-19T23:48:50  <antimatroid1> j3camero: what do you think about ants getting relative information vs home bases?
2010-12-19T23:49:14  <antimatroid1> i tend to agree with sigh, i think it will just add a component to the start where people race to see where/who everyone is
2010-12-19T23:59:12  <antimatroid1> oh, that map gen i posted before may put the home bases within each persons view, i was trying to generate maps where the stupid bot would get near enough for fights to occur
