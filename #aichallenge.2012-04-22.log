2012-04-22T05:39:37  <antimatroid> ffff
2012-04-22T05:39:40  <antimatroid> :P
2012-04-22T05:39:45  <antimatroid> it was stupid
2012-04-22T05:39:47  <mcstar> http://www.science20.com/eye_brainstorm/tronlegacy_and_isomorphisms
2012-04-22T05:39:48  <mcstar> no
2012-04-22T05:40:07  <mcstar> btw, it wasnt a remake
2012-04-22T05:40:12  <mcstar> it is a sequel
2012-04-22T05:41:23  <mcstar> (the problem with the movie, was that stupid looking kid, who played flynn's son)
2012-04-22T05:41:51  <mcstar> and the music is really great
2012-04-22T05:42:05  <antimatroid> i still think "isomorphic algorithms" being the thing to cause some kind of singularity is stupid
2012-04-22T05:42:23  <antimatroid> knowing two objects have the same structure doesn't solve all these things miraculously
2012-04-22T05:42:33  <antimatroid> i think some king of singularity with neural networks would be better
2012-04-22T05:42:48  <antimatroid> /s/king/kind
2012-04-22T05:42:52  <mcstar> antimatroid: well, ppl who think from robotic-airplanes consciousness will emerge, are a bit more stupid
2012-04-22T05:43:07  <mcstar> (i read an article that said that)
2012-04-22T05:43:33  <antimatroid> sure, but why not give an argument that will equally awe them and be semi plausible to everyone else?
2012-04-22T05:44:05  <mcstar> i think the movie was sophisticated
2012-04-22T05:44:08  <AndrewBC> it's pretty obvious to me that the best stimulus for an ai's input/output/evaluation senses is the freaking internet
2012-04-22T05:44:29  <AndrewBC> as far as strong ai goes, anyway
2012-04-22T05:44:55  <mcstar> i wouldnt let my baby ai close to the internet
2012-04-22T05:45:03  <AndrewBC> :)
2012-04-22T05:45:05  <pairofdice> Scarred for life
2012-04-22T05:45:22  <AndrewBC> it's a much more constrained environment than reality, so it dramatically reduces complexity
2012-04-22T05:46:38  <pairofdice> Is this the real world or is it just Internet
2012-04-22T05:47:05  <mcstar> antimatroid: another thing i found hard to believe, or accept , is the travel between reality, and the grid
2012-04-22T05:47:35  <mcstar> i felt that a beam from a vacuum chamber will hardly digitalize anyone
2012-04-22T05:47:40  <mcstar> (but i let it go)
2012-04-22T05:47:49  <antimatroid> yeah but i know nothing about that
2012-04-22T05:48:00  <antimatroid> i'm sure that would piss off people who care about that kind of thing
2012-04-22T05:48:20  <mcstar> yeah, it would piss me off, but i said i....
2012-04-22T05:49:16  <mcstar> antimatroid: probably i watched enough scifi, to develop a mental switch
2012-04-22T05:49:38  <pairofdice> Some people thought the movie was "Laughable" because of God
2012-04-22T05:50:04  <pairofdice> propaganda for evolution, heh
2012-04-22T05:50:17  <mcstar> oh no
2012-04-22T05:51:21  <pairofdice> I guess I'll have to watch it now as well
2012-04-22T05:51:35  <mcstar> i though you already did
2012-04-22T05:52:01  <mcstar> thought
2012-04-22T05:55:39  <pairofdice> Anyway... highest distinction cert from cs101, yay! ;p
2012-04-22T05:58:03  <AndrewBC> lol @ guy who thinks scientists who know about evolution believe life came from nothing. If you know astrophysics and biology, you can draw an interesting comparison between the most common elements in our carbon based life and the most common elements in the universe
2012-04-22T05:58:13  <mcstar> does that mean you are now authorized to use a programming language to defend yourself? pairofdice
2012-04-22T05:59:12  <antimatroid> i choose you C++
2012-04-22T05:59:23  <AndrewBC> gross
2012-04-22T05:59:35  <AndrewBC> that might defend you from other programmers, I guess
2012-04-22T05:59:44  <pairofdice> Like body odor
2012-04-22T05:59:54  * AndrewBC throws a mess of C++ at antimatroid and runs while he tries to figure it out
2012-04-22T06:00:16  <antimatroid> i don't know c++
2012-04-22T06:00:20  <antimatroid> but i can program in it
2012-04-22T06:00:26  <pairofdice> I know of c++
2012-04-22T06:00:36  <AndrewBC> that describes most C++ programmers I think, antimatroid
2012-04-22T06:00:39  <AndrewBC> if not all of them
2012-04-22T06:00:39  <mcstar> i know the letters
2012-04-22T06:00:43  <antimatroid> i think that best describes my programming ability
2012-04-22T06:01:15  <AndrewBC> even bjarne admits to not knowing it all
2012-04-22T06:01:40  <antimatroid> it is the language i am least incompetent at
2012-04-22T06:01:41  <antimatroid> :P
2012-04-22T06:02:16  <mcstar> abomination is the right word, when you are describing c++
2012-04-22T06:02:29  <antimatroid> i still really like it despite the haters
2012-04-22T06:02:41  * mcstar burns in flames
2012-04-22T06:02:50  <antimatroid> it's easy and fast
2012-04-22T06:02:52  <antimatroid> but yeah messy
2012-04-22T06:02:55  <AndrewBC> antimatroid: that's better than hating something you're most familiar with, heh
2012-04-22T06:03:09  <AndrewBC> which started happening to me at the tail end of my php career
2012-04-22T06:03:25  <antimatroid> i haven't done any programming in months :(
2012-04-22T06:03:37  <mcstar> antimatroid: then you are a c++ newbie again
2012-04-22T06:03:42  <mcstar> XD
2012-04-22T06:03:53  <antimatroid> i don't think i ever properly left that group
2012-04-22T06:03:56  <AndrewBC> are you a lifetime programmer?
2012-04-22T06:04:03  <antimatroid> i'm 23
2012-04-22T06:04:07  <AndrewBC> because that's like being in programmer jail
2012-04-22T06:04:22  <antimatroid> i have been occupied with maths
2012-04-22T06:04:28  <antimatroid> so i haven't been lacking in entertainment
2012-04-22T06:04:32  <AndrewBC> oh well that's not a bad replacement
2012-04-22T06:04:46  <AndrewBC> I retract my assertion
2012-04-22T06:04:56  <AndrewBC> that's more like visiting the neighbor
2012-04-22T06:04:59  <antimatroid> actually i lied
2012-04-22T06:05:02  <AndrewBC> >:|
2012-04-22T06:05:04  <AndrewBC> HAY
2012-04-22T06:05:10  <AndrewBC> stop playin', dawg!
2012-04-22T06:05:11  <antimatroid> i tried to program something like a month ago but got sick of it
2012-04-22T06:05:14  <antimatroid> i need to finish it though
2012-04-22T06:05:24  <antimatroid> cause it would be a useful tool for research
2012-04-22T06:06:19  <mcstar> antimatroid: http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/index.html read this
2012-04-22T06:06:36  <mcstar> it is quite short, and will give you some grounds to start doing things in haskell
2012-04-22T06:07:13  <antimatroid> i'll read until i'm bored
2012-04-22T06:07:16  <antimatroid> i'm currently slacking anyway

2012-04-22T07:32:54  <mcstar> antimatroid: so whats the question?
2012-04-22T07:33:10  <antimatroid> how do i make a list containing the fibonacci sequence?
2012-04-22T07:33:12  <antimatroid> using basics
2012-04-22T07:33:28  <mcstar> fib 0 = 1
2012-04-22T07:33:29  <mcstar> fib 1 = 1
2012-04-22T07:33:35  <antimatroid> that's not a list
2012-04-22T07:33:44  <antimatroid> i tried like fib 1 = [0, 1] etc.
2012-04-22T07:33:45  <mcstar> fib n = (fib n-1) + (fib n-2)
2012-04-22T07:33:50  <mcstar> ah list
2012-04-22T07:33:53  <mcstar> sorry
2012-04-22T07:34:10  <antimatroid> you will be :P
2012-04-22T07:34:45  <mcstar> fib = 1 : 1 : (zipWith (+) fib (tail fib))
2012-04-22T07:34:52  <mcstar> i think this should work
2012-04-22T07:35:17  <mcstar> yeah, its working
2012-04-22T07:35:45  <mcstar> btw, i mis parenthesized my first line
2012-04-22T07:35:56  <mcstar> fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
2012-04-22T07:36:20  <mcstar> cause function application has precedence 10, while any infix op can only prec. 9
2012-04-22T07:36:36  <mcstar> antimatroid: are you in ghci?
2012-04-22T07:36:47  <antimatroid> was just using runghc
2012-04-22T07:36:51  <antimatroid> and having .hs file
2012-04-22T07:36:53  <mcstar> ok
2012-04-22T07:37:02  <mcstar> cause in ghci you would need 'let;
2012-04-22T07:37:05  <mcstar> 'let'
2012-04-22T07:38:11  <mcstar> antimatroid: but this definition of the fib. sequence is not exactly basic
2012-04-22T07:38:26  <mcstar> i mean start with something simpler, like doing it with functions
2012-04-22T07:39:51  <mcstar> fib = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib)
2012-04-22T07:40:04  <mcstar> the other parentheses are mandatory
2012-04-22T07:42:08  <antimatroid> can you not just keep adding the sum of the last two elements to the end of the list?
2012-04-22T07:42:44  <mcstar> (:) is the list constructor
2012-04-22T07:42:57  <mcstar> it places 1 elemen on the head of the list
2012-04-22T07:43:11  <mcstar> i.e. it works on the head
2012-04-22T07:43:14  <mcstar> not the end
2012-04-22T07:43:20  <antimatroid> gross
2012-04-22T07:43:40  <antimatroid> meh
2012-04-22T07:43:43  <antimatroid> i don't like it
2012-04-22T07:43:47  <antimatroid> i'm sticking to c+++
2012-04-22T07:44:06  <mcstar> k
2012-04-22T07:44:13  <antimatroid> why can't I just have a c++ that'll let me overload any operators :(
2012-04-22T07:44:24  <mcstar> im sure c++ is much more consistent(LOL)
2012-04-22T07:44:26  <antimatroid> and have haskells type system with type variables etc.
2012-04-22T07:47:18  <antimatroid> mcstar: say I wanted to do fib as a fucntion from natural numbers to lists with pattern matching, can you pastebin that or something?
2012-04-22T07:47:29  <antimatroid> preferably without all the zip with etc. stuff
2012-04-22T07:48:19  <mcstar> so you want all the fib. numbers up to the nth?
2012-04-22T07:48:25  <antimatroid> shouldn't you be able to do something like "fib n = (xs[n-2] + xs[n-1]: xs) where xs = fib (n-1)" or something?
2012-04-22T07:49:36  <mcstar> i think the confusion is that you dont quite know how the lists work
2012-04-22T07:50:01  <mcstar> !! is the list indexing operator btw
2012-04-22T07:50:09  <mcstar> but you shouldnt really use it
2012-04-22T07:50:27  <antimatroid> why not?
2012-04-22T07:50:34  <mcstar> (you dont want to index a list in any language)

2012-04-22T07:52:08  <mcstar> python's lists are VECTORS
2012-04-22T07:52:19  <pairofdice> It's not a linked list
2012-04-22T07:52:24  <pairofdice> But it's a list
2012-04-22T07:52:29  <antimatroid> oh sure
2012-04-22T07:52:46  <antimatroid> you don't use vectors etc. in haskell do you?
2012-04-22T07:52:51  <mcstar> ofc you do
2012-04-22T07:52:54  <mcstar> arrays too
2012-04-22T07:52:57  <mcstar> very easy
2012-04-22T07:53:13  <antimatroid> fib 1 = [1]
2012-04-22T07:53:13  <antimatroid> fib 2 = [2, 1]
2012-04-22T07:53:13  <antimatroid> fib n = (xs!!0 + xs!!1: xs) where xs = fib (n-1)
2012-04-22T07:53:15  <antimatroid> i has that
2012-04-22T08:01:00  <mcstar> well, if you really want something like that
2012-04-22T08:01:03  <mcstar> i prefer this
2012-04-22T08:01:05  <mcstar> let fib 0 = [1]; fib 1 = [1,1]; fib n = let (x1:x2:xs) = fib (n-1) in (x1 + x2) : x1 : x2 : xs
2012-04-22T08:01:45  <mcstar> let fib 0 = [1]; fib 1 = [1,1]; fib n = let a@(x1:x2:xs) = fib (n-1) in (x1 + x2) : a
2012-04-22T08:03:36  <mcstar> antimatroid: but you can just map the fib function over integers
2012-04-22T08:03:46  <mcstar> map fib [1..n]
2012-04-22T08:04:10  <mcstar> (not this one, but which produced the nth number0
2012-04-22T08:04:13  <mcstar> )
