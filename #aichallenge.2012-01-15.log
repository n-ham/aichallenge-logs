2012-01-15T07:02:00  <Guest87085> the analogy I use to describe it overall, is, "can you imagine someone who looks exactly like you somewhere on the planet, now, can you imagine someone who thinks just like you (in respects to personality)"
2012-01-15T07:02:25  <Guest87085> in both cases... almost every answers yes to both
2012-01-15T07:04:32  <Guest87085> what it implies, is that if someone who is physical like you and someone else who shares your mentality, exists in one generation of a life
2012-01-15T07:06:48  <Guest87085> than how many generations before... someone or you"" is literally you in both ways and a literal reiteration of you
2012-01-15T07:08:42  <Guest87085> which since humans physical composition changes at a much slower rate than than a personality
2012-01-15T07:09:11  <Guest87085> you can say... as a simplistic example
2012-01-15T07:10:07  <Guest87085> you reoccur physically every 7 years and you're personality (what makes you feel unique) every 9 years

2012-01-15T07:16:33  <Guest87085> it is a strong counter argument, to saying... people are unique... simply because we have enough combination in genes and neurology that implies most everyone is a few hundred trillion traits away from any other person giving us an unmeasurable amount potential,  when really...  it's really tied back into a system that is a compromise between. wanting to fit in. and conversely maintain our uniqueness
2012-01-15T07:18:18  <Guest87085> the only problem I really came across with all of it... is at how to incorporate how people progress

2012-01-15T07:20:30  <Guest87085> allowing for the formulation of a network... between people, but only when viewed in past tense
2012-01-15T07:23:13  <Guest87085> the analogy, I use to describe it, rather than latex which is to bulky as it is a system of many formulations to understand just this...
2012-01-15T07:23:44  <Guest87085> think of high school cliches.
2012-01-15T07:24:09  <Guest87085> you have a set of stereo types... from goth, to emo, to punk, to prep
2012-01-15T07:25:00  <Guest87085> but ultimately. each of the stereotypes can be traced back to an original goth, etc.
2012-01-15T07:25:21  <Guest87085> the parent...
2012-01-15T07:26:44  <Guest87085> and no child regardless of what stereotype they are mostly influenced into being... always exhibits traits of other stereotypes
2012-01-15T07:28:12  <Guest87085> that's why they children are children, otherwise... you'd have to be the parent... which is a degradation the closer to a parent you derive from
2012-01-15T07:29:19  <Guest87085> and children... are the the chemistry that eventually produces the next parent
2012-01-15T07:29:58  <Guest87085> this is relative to a persons diversity
2012-01-15T07:32:20  <Guest87085> but as long as we give definition to a person who yield primarily the personality innovation, as opposed to physical composition, you can maintain a simple parent, child relative network between all people
2012-01-15T07:35:07  <Guest87085> this, is a valuable notion, when devising methods of what ideally most people want to think they are. the next person to be unique enough to be given a definition that truly makes them unique, while consequently, being the standard for all derived children to see you as the standard of what also helps them fit in

2012-01-15T08:26:08  <mcstar> why dont you make sense?
2012-01-15T08:26:31  <mcstar> calculus has not much to do with higher order logic
2012-01-15T08:26:36  <antimatroid1> no
2012-01-15T08:26:44  <Colors> it's a linguistic habit developed from unique circumstances
2012-01-15T08:26:47  <Colors> no
2012-01-15T08:26:49  <antimatroid1> nor do i know what logic had to do with anything
2012-01-15T08:27:01  <mcstar> well, pretty much
2012-01-15T08:27:08  <mcstar> i read nonstandard analysis
2012-01-15T08:27:14  <mcstar> and it is developed from formal logic
2012-01-15T08:27:27  <Colors> calc is derivatives and and integrals
2012-01-15T08:27:29  <mcstar> but it is too advanced to even talk about
2012-01-15T08:27:41  <antimatroid1> depends on where you draw the line
2012-01-15T08:27:46  <antimatroid1> what about calculus of variations?
2012-01-15T08:27:47  <Colors> most often used in applications involving a time variable
2012-01-15T08:27:49  <antimatroid1> or de's?
2012-01-15T08:27:52  <antimatroid1> or vector calculus
2012-01-15T08:27:53  <antimatroid1> etc.
2012-01-15T08:27:54  <Colors> permuations?
2012-01-15T08:28:08  <antimatroid1> permutations are mostly treated as groups
2012-01-15T08:28:15  <mcstar> antimatroid1: csirmaz laszlo: nemsztenderd analizis
2012-01-15T08:28:17  <Colors> set theory
2012-01-15T08:28:20  <Colors> ok ok
2012-01-15T08:28:28  <Colors> row-echelon form
2012-01-15T08:28:41  <antimatroid1> now you're just throwing random words out of your ass
2012-01-15T08:29:02  <antimatroid1> sure they have meaning (for gaussian elimination) but where's the relevance?
2012-01-15T08:29:10  <Colors> LU Decomposition
2012-01-15T08:29:18  <Colors> QR Decomposition
2012-01-15T08:29:28  <mcstar> antimatroid1: he is basically wolfram alpha for irc
2012-01-15T08:29:31  <Colors> eigenvalues in eigenspace
2012-01-15T08:29:40  <antimatroid1> wolfram alpha is useful
2012-01-15T08:29:45  <Colors> you know how taught me about eigen vectors?
2012-01-15T08:29:56  <antimatroid1> strang
2012-01-15T08:30:11  <mcstar> Colors: stfu, yesterday you pretty much showed you dont know a thing about eigenvectors
2012-01-15T08:30:14  <Colors> did you know google originally was based on ehtm?
2012-01-15T08:30:19  <Colors> them*
2012-01-15T08:30:25  <antimatroid1> yes
2012-01-15T08:30:42  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-140-105.dynamic.chello.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2012-01-15T08:31:10  <Colors> they are vectors where every element changes by the same function
2012-01-15T08:31:31  <mcstar> what was google based on originally?
2012-01-15T08:31:33  <Colors> and if I remember correctly... the axis, dpm
2012-01-15T08:31:36  <Colors> don't change
2012-01-15T08:31:43  <Colors> page rank
2012-01-15T08:32:12  <Colors> which is produced by an algorithm utilizing weighted elements in eigenvector space
2012-01-15T08:32:14  <antimatroid1> they're vectors which satisfy Av = kv, ie. a constant scaling, where k is your eigenvector
2012-01-15T08:32:19  <antimatroid1> eigenvalue*
2012-01-15T08:33:09  <Colors> the eigen value is the function applied to each element
2012-01-15T08:33:13  <mcstar> yes, in those directionks the matrix behaves like a simple scaling
2012-01-15T08:33:16  <antimatroid1> the best way to learn linear algebra is from vector spaces and up
2012-01-15T08:33:28  <Colors> an example is skewing and stretching an image
2012-01-15T08:33:48  <mcstar> ?
2012-01-15T08:33:58  <mcstar> the eigenvalue is the scale factor
2012-01-15T08:34:03  <antimatroid1> yeah
2012-01-15T08:34:04  <mcstar> in the eigen-directions
2012-01-15T08:34:18  <Colors> skewing and stretching
2012-01-15T08:34:41  <mcstar> ofc its a bit more complex if you can have complex elements
2012-01-15T08:34:54  <Colors> like weighted elements
2012-01-15T08:34:59  <Colors> like in page ranbk
2012-01-15T08:35:01  <Colors> rank*
2012-01-15T08:35:30  <mcstar> Colors: do you have something to say?
2012-01-15T08:35:34  <mcstar> do you have a point?
2012-01-15T08:35:34  <antimatroid1> mcstar: or any arbitrary field
2012-01-15T08:35:37  <Colors> one of the last mentors I spent time with, was gabriel pinski
2012-01-15T08:36:05  <Colors> him and francis narin produced the algorithm for page rank
2012-01-15T08:36:18  <Colors> use some 30 years later by google
2012-01-15T08:36:28  <Colors> as it's soul function
2012-01-15T08:37:03  <mcstar> Dr. Gabriel Pinski MD practices geriatric psychiatry
2012-01-15T08:37:28  <Colors> is their something wrong with having many degrees?
2012-01-15T08:37:55  <mcstar> i like having many degrees of freedom
2012-01-15T08:37:58  <Colors> like CS, EE, a CCSP
2012-01-15T08:38:23  <Colors> I like having a broad knowledge... and utilizing it in every aspect of the digital paradigm
2012-01-15T08:38:50  <Colors> the allowance and ability to be diverse... is as free as you get
2012-01-15T08:39:03  <mcstar> how old are you?
2012-01-15T08:39:10  <Colors> 23
2012-01-15T08:39:14  <Colors> and retired friend
2012-01-15T08:40:09  <mcstar> "and retired friend"
2012-01-15T08:40:18  <mcstar> whose retired friend?
2012-01-15T08:40:23  <Colors> me
2012-01-15T08:40:40  <mcstar> are you your own retired friend?
2012-01-15T08:40:56  <Colors> I won't say, I'm not
2012-01-15T08:41:18  <Colors> in the last 5 years or so, I've lived as an extreme recluse
2012-01-15T08:41:27  <mcstar> will you say that it is correct to believe that in the state that is you are willing to say that you dont think it is appropriate to think that?
2012-01-15T08:42:07  <Colors> could you re paraphrase that a little better
2012-01-15T08:42:19  <Colors> just a misunderstanding
2012-01-15T08:43:15  <Colors> mcstar?
2012-01-15T08:43:28  <mcstar> it is possible for me actually understand written and spoken words in the specific sorruondings with respect to the given context in every know and applicable fields of knowledge
2012-01-15T08:46:25  <Colors> you mean, in english, the grammar of it... is easy to not only say the same thing in many different ways... but provides flexibility to understanding a slightly imperfectly complete thought
2012-01-15T08:47:30  <Colors> unfortunately, english is not comparable to logic... and programming
2012-01-15T08:47:49  <Colors> for starters english came about as naturally as most any other language
2012-01-15T08:49:12  <Colors> where as programming languages are engineered, and don't utilize grammer, but syntax... that is at most soft typed
2012-01-15T08:49:24  <Colors> for a language like C++
2012-01-15T08:49:44  <sigh> programming languages don't utilise grammar?
2012-01-15T08:50:01  <Colors> and strong typed for a engineering language such as  VHDL is strong typed
2012-01-15T08:50:14  <antimatroid1> sigh: it's a trap
2012-01-15T08:50:22  <Colors> grammar is a set of rules on how to you can put together a sentence... that means the same thing
2012-01-15T08:50:41  <sigh> not really, he's not clever enough to set traps
2012-01-15T08:50:49  <Colors> where as syntax... is geared towards developing definite methods of unchanging syntax
2012-01-15T08:51:03  <antimatroid1> no, i mean responding is a trap ;)
2012-01-15T08:51:12  <Colors> like loop statements
2012-01-15T08:51:19  <antimatroid1> exactly
2012-01-15T08:51:22  <sigh> oh, I was curious about his reasoning
2012-01-15T08:51:52  <Colors> and logic as high as first order... is as equally strict
2012-01-15T08:52:15  <Colors> even in math...
2012-01-15T08:52:20  <Colors> you have order of operations
2012-01-15T08:52:35  <Colors> if not followed... you get the wrong answer
2012-01-15T08:52:58  <Colors> even in science... you have a method that is standardized
2012-01-15T08:53:51  <Colors> you don't have thousands of english majors working to perfect a standard for how a sentence should be said in all cases
2012-01-15T08:55:56  <Colors> the closest collaborations you have for what could be compared to the collaboration put into, say linux, would be an encyclopedia or reference
2012-01-15T08:56:21  <Colors> tsk tsk...
2012-01-15T08:57:10  <sigh> it's curious that he inverts the charater of syntax and grammar
2012-01-15T08:57:48  <Colors> as semantics are your own intellectual tool
2012-01-15T08:58:32  <Colors> to comparatively writing a entertaining novel
2012-01-15T08:59:23  <sigh> is that what this is?
2012-01-15T08:59:45  <Colors> and you're perspective?
2012-01-15T09:00:13  <sigh> and I am perspective?
2012-01-15T09:00:38  <Colors> you are not defined as perspective
2012-01-15T09:00:47  <sigh> you just did
2012-01-15T09:00:52  <Colors> you have an attribute like myself, that is a perspective
2012-01-15T09:01:04  <Colors> you're is a good example
2012-01-15T09:01:55  <Colors> you're your and whatever the third variation
2012-01-15T09:02:43  <Colors> are a great example of inefficiency in english... when like whatshisface said, you can easily tell from context sensitivity
2012-01-15T09:03:07  <Colors> what one your means in all 3 uses
2012-01-15T09:04:07  <sigh> and you must suck at designing protocols
2012-01-15T09:04:12  <Colors> you can prove this too yourself.. to see how many times someone corrects you when you use the wrong variation of the word
2012-01-15T09:04:36  <mcstar> stfu colours
2012-01-15T09:04:57  <Colors> keep being who you are ^_^
2012-01-15T09:05:03  <sigh> let's throw out all checksums
2012-01-15T09:05:12  <sigh> clearly they are just redundant
2012-01-15T09:05:26  <Colors> uh...
2012-01-15T09:05:51  <Colors> how about... in the TCP protocol
2012-01-15T09:06:23  <Colors> checksums, quite redundant, lol
2012-01-15T09:06:31  <sigh> *shrug* you were the one railing about inefficiency
2012-01-15T09:06:56  <Colors> here, I'll give you a polar opposite
2012-01-15T09:07:06  <Colors> what if you tried to communicate by painting pictures
2012-01-15T09:07:21  <Colors> it's be much more inefficient than speaking english
2012-01-15T09:07:44  <sigh> it's a common enough passtime
2012-01-15T09:07:50  <Colors> just like english is much more inefficient than programs
2012-01-15T09:08:12  <sigh> again, you don't understand how to design protocols
2012-01-15T09:08:23  <sigh> if you think that about english
2012-01-15T09:08:56  <Colors> I'm not a big corporation implementing them
2012-01-15T09:09:23  <Colors> why don't you google a protocol and see how many people produce them v. how many companies do
2012-01-15T09:09:56  <Colors> go on...
2012-01-15T09:11:05  <sigh> wow... it's amazing how many non-sequiturs you packed into that sentence
2012-01-15T09:11:06  <Colors> my focus... within the last 4 years has mostly been around, designing circuits that are VLSI
2012-01-15T09:11:11  <sigh> this is boring... I'm out
2012-01-15T09:11:19  <Colors> and Ai
2012-01-15T09:12:02  <Colors> ever wonder how CPUs get engineered?
2012-01-15T09:12:09  <Colors> that's what I do
2012-01-15T09:12:17  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2012-01-15T09:13:50  <Colors> there's an important difference between a person who only excepts information with merits to back it
2012-01-15T09:15:05  <Colors> and th person who is capable of understanding the information enough to feel asserted in it's accuracy without merit
2012-01-15T09:15:10  <Colors> the*
2012-01-15T09:17:48  <mcstar> Colors: i wasnt talking to you, i was talking to colours
2012-01-15T09:18:36  <Colors> Colors is a name given to me by some google engineers I spend most of my socialization
2012-01-15T09:18:40  <Colors> with
2012-01-15T09:18:46  <Colors> not so much lately
2012-01-15T09:19:17  <mcstar> Colors: have you seen colours lately?
2012-01-15T09:19:58  <Colors> nope
2012-01-15T09:20:03  <Colors> just Color
2012-01-15T09:20:11  <mcstar> who is Color?
2012-01-15T09:21:45  <Colors> why are you asking me if I've seen colours
2012-01-15T09:22:01  <Colors> and you mean to say, what is Color
2012-01-15T09:22:11  <mcstar> no
2012-01-15T09:22:34  <mcstar> you answered you saw Color, to my question, have you seen Colours
2012-01-15T09:22:43  <mcstar> since Colours is a person
2012-01-15T09:22:49  <mcstar> it implies that Color is too
2012-01-15T09:23:17  <mcstar> so you are wrong telling me, i should have asked "what is color"
2012-01-15T09:23:37  <Colors> !lastseen Colours
2012-01-15T09:24:16  <mcstar> Colors: do you know what is the difference between colors and colours?
2012-01-15T09:24:48  <Colors> one is spelled incorrectly
2012-01-15T09:24:55  <Colors> yours
2012-01-15T09:25:02  <mcstar> which is mine?
2012-01-15T09:25:09  <Colors> colours
2012-01-15T09:25:18  <mcstar> colours is everyones
2012-01-15T09:25:30  <Colors> uh...
2012-01-15T09:26:04  <Colors> color is the visible spectrum of light
2012-01-15T09:26:31  <Colors> are you trying to make a point?
2012-01-15T09:26:43  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-15T09:26:49  <mcstar> as small as possible
2012-01-15T09:26:52  <Colors> or are you learning to become what you assume I am?
2012-01-15T09:27:03  <Colors> than make it... without the stupid foreplay
2012-01-15T09:27:10  <mcstar> do you know what is the diameter of the smallest recorded point in history?
2012-01-15T09:27:29  <Colors> no?
2012-01-15T09:27:35  <Colors> a quark?
2012-01-15T09:27:41  <Colors> from the LHC?
2012-01-15T09:27:48  <mcstar> wrong
2012-01-15T09:27:50  <Colors> or was it a boson
2012-01-15T09:28:01  <mcstar> it clearly show how stupid you are
2012-01-15T09:28:04  <mcstar> show*
2012-01-15T09:28:05  <mcstar> shows*
2012-01-15T09:28:06  <Colors> ok
2012-01-15T09:28:12  <Colors> measured diameter
2012-01-15T09:28:22  <Colors> the smallest recorded diameter
2012-01-15T09:28:44  <Colors> is something like infinite divergence on 0
2012-01-15T09:28:53  <Colors> for as long as you want to compute it
2012-01-15T09:29:03  <mcstar> still wrong
2012-01-15T09:29:12  <mcstar> do you want me to tell you?
2012-01-15T09:29:20  <mcstar> or you rather figure it out yourself
2012-01-15T09:29:26  <Colors> naw
2012-01-15T09:29:30  <Colors> just tell...
2012-01-15T09:29:47  <Colors> in another case, I would love to try and figure it out
2012-01-15T09:29:53  <Colors> but I have work to do
2012-01-15T09:29:54  <mcstar> every point has no extent whatsoever
2012-01-15T09:30:01  <Colors> lol
2012-01-15T09:30:06  <Colors> so I'm right
2012-01-15T09:30:09  <mcstar> no
2012-01-15T09:30:14  <Colors> infinite divergence to 0
2012-01-15T09:30:20  <Colors> for as long as you want to computer it
2012-01-15T09:30:25  <Colors> never reaching 0
2012-01-15T09:30:31  <Colors> but getting smaller and smaller
2012-01-15T09:30:32  <mcstar> do you know what is divergence/convergence?
2012-01-15T09:32:05  <mcstar> Colors: if you are relly smart, can you give me two integers, x and y, which satisfies this equality: x^2-61*y^2=1
2012-01-15T09:33:26  <Colors> off the top of my head
2012-01-15T09:33:43  <antimatroid1> mcstar: lol :P
2012-01-15T09:33:51  <Colors> something like subtracting  1 from both sides
2012-01-15T09:34:03  <Colors> no
2012-01-15T09:34:15  <Colors> adding 61 to bot sides
2012-01-15T09:34:34  <Colors> and then taking the square root of both sides
2012-01-15T09:35:02  <Colors> factor 62
2012-01-15T09:35:31  <Colors> this is
2012-01-15T09:35:36  <Colors> pythag
2012-01-15T09:35:44  <Colors> no
2012-01-15T09:37:20  <mcstar> it is relatively easy
2012-01-15T09:37:26  <mcstar> but i need the exact numbers
2012-01-15T09:37:32  <Colors> x*y = 62
2012-01-15T09:38:05  <mcstar> what is that?
2012-01-15T09:38:11  <Colors> 62 2 32 2 16 2 8 2 4  2 2
2012-01-15T09:38:48  <Colors> 2 * 2 * 2
2012-01-15T09:38:50  <Colors> 8
2012-01-15T09:39:36  <Colors> y = x/8
2012-01-15T09:41:42  <Colors> something wrong with my factoring
2012-01-15T09:41:46  <Colors> is all
