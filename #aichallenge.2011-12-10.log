2011-12-10T00:01:32  <BenJackson> there
2011-12-10T00:01:44  <besh> how do create combat scenarious for testing ?
2011-12-10T00:01:52  <BenJackson> http://paste.aichallenge.org/Hvijl/
2011-12-10T00:01:56  <McLeopold> okay, basically, he just keeps 3 guys alive on his front
2011-12-10T00:02:01  <BenJackson> best: make a .map (they're super simple) with a and b ants
2011-12-10T00:02:06  <BenJackson> then run with --scenario, --food none
2011-12-10T00:02:17  <McLeopold> but the gap has to be filled
2011-12-10T00:02:46  <BenJackson> remember in that scenario he would have died anyway
2011-12-10T00:02:50  <BenJackson> he was one of the front-line ants
2011-12-10T00:02:56  <McLeopold> right
2011-12-10T00:03:13  <BenJackson> so the reasoning goes "if I don't move, I could be killed" "if I move forward I could also be killed but take some of the bastards with me"
2011-12-10T00:03:32  <McLeopold> but you don't take em, you save your own
2011-12-10T00:03:42  <BenJackson> HOWEVER it should be P(they'll move forward) * "could be killed" vs P(they'll stand still) * "will be killed"
2011-12-10T00:04:01  <BenJackson> and P(they'll move forward) is very small
2011-12-10T00:04:05  <BenJackson> so it should feel safe staying in place
2011-12-10T00:09:58  <McLeopold> okay, time to implement a1k0n's combat method...

2011-12-10T00:14:42  <janzert> working on the rest now
2011-12-10T00:14:53  <janzert> and planning on a forum announcement once I get there :)
2011-12-10T00:15:24  <amstan_> noo! you rebooted!
2011-12-10T00:15:26  <amstan_> lol
2011-12-10T00:15:30  <janzert> I didn't
2011-12-10T00:15:33  <amstan_> manager uptime went from 50days to 18min
2011-12-10T00:15:35  <janzert> I saw that it dod though
2011-12-10T00:15:38  <janzert> did
2011-12-10T00:15:45  <janzert> kicked my ssh session out
2011-12-10T00:16:25  <amstan_> fixed the hostname

2011-12-10T00:16:39  <BenJackson> 11 servers and 5.6 gpm, wow
2011-12-10T00:16:54  <janzert> I know amazon had a maintenance reboot coming up but I thought it wasn't until sunday
2011-12-10T00:16:59  <janzert> so not sure
2011-12-10T00:17:03  <amstan_> oh, that too
2011-12-10T00:17:16  <janzert> said it received a ctrl-alt-del so I assume amazon was the cause though
2011-12-10T00:17:43  <janzert> there we go
2011-12-10T00:19:04  <amstan_> janzert: are you intending to add to credits.php?
2011-12-10T00:19:42  <janzert> heh, it still says "Google AI Challenge"
2011-12-10T00:19:52  <amstan_> yeah, if you're editing that, can you change it?
2011-12-10T00:20:24  <janzert> it had crossed my mind that we should create a sponsors section in there, but I didn't have any specific plans
2011-12-10T00:20:26  <amstan_> i'm thinking of either a Sponsors section or put both google and totaalnet in special thanks
2011-12-10T00:20:32  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2011-12-10T00:20:39  <amstan> yeah, sponsors section would be good
2011-12-10T00:21:15  <janzert> I think Jeff will need to check with Google before we add them there, and it'd probably be nice to add the logo for that
2011-12-10T00:22:05  <amstan> they're already in the title as "Sponsored by", i don't think it matters if we add another line in the credits mentioning their name
2011-12-10T00:22:16  <amstan> the only issue is logo usage
2011-12-10T00:24:28  <amstan> janzert: is this not vmd?
2011-12-10T00:24:52  <amstan> oh, nvm
2011-12-10T00:24:56  <amstan> pci bridge vendor vmware
2011-12-10T00:25:26  <amstan> janzert: what about cpu freq?
2011-12-10T00:27:35  <janzert> 3.0ghz as compared to 2.667
2011-12-10T00:28:04  <amstan> yes
2011-12-10T00:28:13  <amstan> isn't that a problem?
2011-12-10T00:28:21  <janzert> I don't think so
2011-12-10T00:28:42  <amstan> hkraal_ was mentioning that vmware could limit the freq, so we could match the ec2
2011-12-10T00:28:57  <janzert> they'll be a little faster, but there is variance from game to game anyway
2011-12-10T00:29:05  <amstan> ok
2011-12-10T00:33:24  <Wraithan> happening to be on a noisy box on ec2 can affect your performance quite a bit. Commonly people will spin up more servers than they need, benchmark them, and keep only the fastest ones.
2011-12-10T00:33:42  <Wraithan> So there is already a decent amount of variance
2011-12-10T00:35:24  <BenJackson> 21:28 <@amstan> yes

2011-12-10T00:36:08  <a1k0n> awesome
2011-12-10T00:36:27  <BenJackson> like the mean and variation of the relative scores of people in each position
2011-12-10T00:36:34  <BenJackson> that'd be a hell of a query though :)
2011-12-10T00:36:55  <amstan> BenJackson: if you can make it, sure
2011-12-10T00:37:00  <amstan> BenJackson: i can test it for you
2011-12-10T00:37:08  <amstan> to make sure it doesn't take ages
2011-12-10T00:37:11  <janzert> and it doesn't DoS the server :P
2011-12-10T00:37:35  <amstan> yes, nothing that a mysql restart and then restart of all workers won't fix
2011-12-10T00:37:51  <janzert> heh
2011-12-10T00:40:14  <BenJackson> resubmitting will be much more exciting now

2011-12-10T00:42:39  <a1k0n> haha wow: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=178562&user=432
2011-12-10T00:43:06  <a1k0n> and that is why you don't need a very dense gas of ants for collecting food
2011-12-10T00:43:20  <amstan> that's a lot of debug code, lol
2011-12-10T00:44:19  <amstan> oh man, you're just plowing through them
2011-12-10T00:49:35  <Antimony> I wonder if I should attempt to implement an evenly spread "gas" like that
2011-12-10T00:50:10  <McLeopold> what a nice looking map
2011-12-10T00:50:34  <a1k0n> some of the starting hills are a little close there
2011-12-10T00:50:46  <a1k0n> it's frankly amazing i didn't lose both right away
2011-12-10T00:50:46  <McLeopold> not according to the spec :)
2011-12-10T00:51:09  <McLeopold> 3 per player
2011-12-10T00:51:26  <a1k0n> oh right.  i did lose 2/3 right away
2011-12-10T00:52:04  <a1k0n> though really you're better off without those hills
2011-12-10T00:52:22  <McLeopold> better defense for the last?
2011-12-10T00:52:25  *** bmh <bmh!ada4e181@fsf/member/bmh> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-10T00:52:51  <a1k0n> well, once you finally get your economy going into the midgame you can stream ants out of the one hill and thus defend it by default
2011-12-10T00:52:51  <McLeopold> a1k0n: are you still using the combat you described?
2011-12-10T00:52:55  <a1k0n> the others are just too contested
2011-12-10T00:52:57  <a1k0n> i am
2011-12-10T00:53:08  <McLeopold> I'm going to try and implement it now
2011-12-10T00:53:21  <McLeopold> although, I'm still slightly confused about it
2011-12-10T00:53:24  <bmh> McLeopold: well I'm going to try to implement a *better* strategy
2011-12-10T00:53:43  <a1k0n> everyone seems slightly confused about it, probably including me
2011-12-10T00:53:49  <bmh> a1k0n: I still think examining one ant at a time is bound to get you stuck at local maxima.
2011-12-10T00:53:55  <a1k0n> but whatever mess i made happens to seem to work sorta
2011-12-10T00:54:06  <a1k0n> well, naturally
2011-12-10T00:54:32  <McLeopold> can I summarize and you tell me where I go wrong?
2011-12-10T00:54:37  <a1k0n> sure
2011-12-10T00:54:40  <McLeopold> 1) pick one ant (yours or enemies)
2011-12-10T00:55:01  <bmh> so far so good.
2011-12-10T00:55:12  <McLeopold> 2) try all 5 moves and pick the set of best moves and inc that ants D array by 1
2011-12-10T00:55:19  <a1k0n> yep
2011-12-10T00:55:21  <McLeopold> for each best move
2011-12-10T00:55:30  <McLeopold> 3) ???
2011-12-10T00:55:37  <a1k0n> 4) profit
2011-12-10T00:55:40  <a1k0n> that's it
2011-12-10T00:55:48  <bmh> 3) If you have time left, go to 1
2011-12-10T00:55:59  <McLeopold> 3) move the ant?
2011-12-10T00:56:02  <a1k0n> no, 3) pick a random move according to your new D distribution
2011-12-10T00:56:14  <McLeopold> for every ant or just the one?
2011-12-10T00:56:33  <a1k0n> so if you have [a,b,c,d,e] you pick move 0 with probability a/(a+b+c+d+e), move 1 with b/(a+b+c+d+e), etc
2011-12-10T00:56:36  <a1k0n> for just the one ant
2011-12-10T00:56:39  <McLeopold> ok
2011-12-10T00:56:44  <McLeopold> 3) move the ant!
2011-12-10T00:56:50  <a1k0n> yes.
2011-12-10T00:56:55  <a1k0n> 4) goto 1
2011-12-10T00:57:04  <McLeopold> 4) maybe look for stabilized ant, otherwise go to 1
2011-12-10T00:57:10  <a1k0n> yeah.
2011-12-10T00:57:19  <McLeopold> and the magic is in the score?
2011-12-10T00:57:20  <antimatroid> if(not over time) go to 1
2011-12-10T00:57:30  <antimatroid> :p
2011-12-10T00:57:35  <a1k0n> yes.  each time you move the ant, you need to resolve combat and check the score.
2011-12-10T00:58:02  <McLeopold> so, I assume you tried a score of how many of your ants die?
2011-12-10T00:58:12  <McLeopold> if so, how did that do?
2011-12-10T00:58:13  <a1k0n> and how many they kill, yes.
2011-12-10T00:58:28  <antimatroid> a1k0n have you considered running minimax on "all defensive" vs. "all offensive" then trying to "perturb" the chosen state?
2011-12-10T00:58:37  <antimatroid> rather than "perturbing" it from the starting state?
2011-12-10T00:58:39  <a1k0n> well, it helps to weigh your ants more heavily than your enemies
2011-12-10T00:58:40  <bmh> antimatroid: minimax is expensive
2011-12-10T00:58:51  <antimatroid> not when you and your oponents have 2 moves each
2011-12-10T00:58:52  <a1k0n> antimatroid: i have
2011-12-10T00:59:04  <McLeopold> so, you lose 1 is worse than they lose 1?
2011-12-10T00:59:12  <a1k0n> yeah.
2011-12-10T00:59:18  <bmh> a1k0n: don't forget to tell the good people to more readily throw your ants down the oubliette when they're near the hill
2011-12-10T00:59:20  <a1k0n> otherwise 1:1 trades are fine, and they really aren't fine
2011-12-10T00:59:38  <a1k0n> yes, having some notion of defending your hill in there is probably good
2011-12-10T00:59:40  <McLeopold> I have my on secret for deciding on a 1:1 kill :)
2011-12-10T01:00:16  <McLeopold> which everyone probably already does :(
2011-12-10T01:00:59  <antimatroid> you have less friends than enemies in the battle partition?
2011-12-10T01:01:10  <McLeopold> nope, ready for the game changer?
2011-12-10T01:01:12  <antimatroid> or you have more ants so you want to take them down?
2011-12-10T01:01:22  <antimatroid> the suspense is killing me :P
2011-12-10T01:01:38  <a1k0n> it's a miracle i survived this: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=178562&user=432&row=42&col=14&turn=165
2011-12-10T01:01:55  <McLeopold> the cost of an ant dying is it's distance from its nearest hill
2011-12-10T01:02:15  * McLeopold does punctuation fail
2011-12-10T01:02:23  <bmh> McLeopold: linear costing seems... too simple?
2011-12-10T01:02:26  <antimatroid> wouldn't you want to keep ants alive near your hill?
2011-12-10T01:02:40  <bmh> I was thinking of using a 1/sqrt(n) costing
2011-12-10T01:02:47  <McLeopold> no
2011-12-10T01:02:53  <McLeopold> I don't see why
2011-12-10T01:02:58  <antimatroid> hill defense
2011-12-10T01:03:01  <a1k0n> well, it helps to make last-ditch suicides to keep your hill
2011-12-10T01:03:09  <antimatroid> yes, but minimax deals with that :P
2011-12-10T01:03:13  <McLeopold> this is for a 1:1 trade only
2011-12-10T01:03:22  <a1k0n> good luck with that
2011-12-10T01:03:22  <antimatroid> what about n:n trade?
2011-12-10T01:03:25  <McLeopold> obviously formations would trump it
2011-12-10T01:03:29  <bmh> a1k0n: that's epic.
2011-12-10T01:04:26  <McLeopold> the time to replace an ant is the walking distance from the hill, if you have a good economy
2011-12-10T01:04:31  <a1k0n> minimax only really works if you can exhaustively search your opponents' refutation of the moves you're considering
2011-12-10T01:04:46  <McLeopold> so, n:n trades near your hill push the enemy back, all things being equal
2011-12-10T01:05:01  <a1k0n> so maybe your idea will work with perturbing the obvious moves

2011-12-10T01:05:50  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i pick offensive moves as follows, order ants based on closest enemy, then move into the square that minimises the positive possible number of enemys it can engage in battle with next turn

2011-12-10T01:05:59  <a1k0n> i do actually have an optional seeding step where i step all my ants towards/away from enemies and my enemy does the same, in order to start the dirichlet distributions off with something
2011-12-10T01:06:14  <antimatroid> defensive is order ants based on furthest enemy and move to the square with minimum possible number of battle enemies

2011-12-10T01:07:18  <a1k0n> McLeopold: not really
2011-12-10T01:07:26  <a1k0n> i just check for 95% o the "weight" in one move
2011-12-10T01:07:51  <McLeopold> I guess that number depends on the scoring then
2011-12-10T01:08:02  <antimatroid> you can also further tiebreak on things like no of unmoved ants that could move into the square or something
2011-12-10T01:08:10  <a1k0n> well, maybe, but not really
2011-12-10T01:08:32  <a1k0n> omg, my kid is going crazy i beter get him in bed
2011-12-10T01:08:40  <McLeopold> do you every update the D array more than 1?
2011-12-10T01:08:57  <a1k0n> if two moves have equal score, then both get incremented
2011-12-10T01:09:11  <McLeopold> do you split ants into theaters?  I'm working on that now
2011-12-10T01:09:16  <a1k0n> nope
2011-12-10T01:09:24  <a1k0n> but it would probably be a good idea
2011-12-10T01:09:47  <McLeopold> but a single move for a single ant never gets more than 1 on an update?
2011-12-10T01:09:50  <a1k0n> i think i've now officially spent more idea discussing my implementation than implementing it
2011-12-10T01:09:56  <McLeopold> :)
2011-12-10T01:09:57  <a1k0n> right
2011-12-10T01:10:00  <McLeopold> ok
2011-12-10T01:10:03  <McLeopold> off I go...
2011-12-10T01:10:27  <bmh> that's only because code spills forth from your mind like ambrosia on the firma
2011-12-10T01:12:54  <a1k0n> unlike words, which get transposed freely
2011-12-10T01:12:58  <a1k0n> s/idea/time/
2011-12-10T01:13:47  <a1k0n> my kid left some effing toy in my car, and can't go to bed without it, and the goddamn sprinklers are on so i can't even go outside without getting wet and why are sprinklers on in december anyway
2011-12-10T01:14:33  <bmh> a1k0n: in a drought region, no less
2011-12-10T01:19:56  <McLeopold> a1k0n: I deny my kid all the plesures of life, so he doesn't know the comforts of going to bed with a toy.  no problems so far
2011-12-10T01:20:30  <antimatroid> suckers, it's like 30 degrees here :P
2011-12-10T01:20:33  <bmh> McLeopold: good thinking. My parents spoiled me and now I'm an ungrateful git.
2011-12-10T01:20:40  <bmh> antimatroid: c or f?
2011-12-10T01:20:46  <antimatroid> actually, 24 apparently, but feels warmer i swear
2011-12-10T01:20:47  <antimatroid> c
2011-12-10T01:20:53  <McLeopold> antimatroid: over here, 30 is freezing
2011-12-10T01:21:20  <bmh> antimatroid: 'eh, it was around 19c today
2011-12-10T01:21:54  <janzert> I think it almost made it up to 30f here today ;)
2011-12-10T01:22:08  <bmh> janzert: CA > MI :)
2011-12-10T01:22:12  <antimatroid> yeah but you guys use whack measurements :P
2011-12-10T01:22:15  <janzert> although it's back into the teens now :/
2011-12-10T01:22:24  <McLeopold> if your not using kelvin, you can talk
2011-12-10T01:22:29  <janzert> bmh: heh, that's what my brother decided too :P
2011-12-10T01:22:35  <antimatroid> and i am :P
2011-12-10T01:22:47  <McLeopold> 30 kelvin?  are you a brain in a jar?
2011-12-10T01:22:48  <antimatroid> anyway, off to a bbq

2011-12-10T01:25:11  <McLeopold> I don't know :)

2011-12-10T01:26:10  <dragonfyre13> hey there everyone
2011-12-10T01:26:29  <dragonfyre13> Quick question if someone knows. Any idea of numexpr is able to be used on the servers?
2011-12-10T01:26:30  <janzert> I used to use it to make sure a worker wasn't timing out every bot
2011-12-10T01:28:37  <janzert> dragonfyre13: I'd be rather surprised if it was
2011-12-10T01:28:58  <dragonfyre13> darn. Wonder if me submitting a request for it at this point would do any good....
2011-12-10T01:29:06  <janzert> you can always try submitting a quick bot that imports and tries to use it to check though
2011-12-10T01:29:16  <dragonfyre13> janzert: yeah, that's what I was going to try next
2011-12-10T01:29:20  <dragonfyre13> janzert: thanks
2011-12-10T01:29:48  <janzert> yeah, with only a week to go I'm probably not going to make much of any language changes
2011-12-10T01:31:25  <bmh> but janzert, I program brilliantly fast in FrTime. Please consider supporting it!
2011-12-10T01:31:35  <janzert> :)
2011-12-10T01:32:37  <bmh> The purpose of Lisp is not to enable programming. It's to enable the creation of a language where your program can be expressed in a single statement. </profundity>

2011-12-10T01:42:54  <McLeopold> ignore that part :)
2011-12-10T01:43:39  <bhasker> question how does one add visualization information
2011-12-10T01:43:48  <bhasker> i remember reading on the forum but can't remember
2011-12-10T01:44:02  <McLeopold> bhasker: you should start by cloning the j-h-a aichallenge repo from github
2011-12-10T01:44:15  <McLeopold> the instructions are all there
2011-12-10T01:44:16  <bhasker> hmm k let me see

2011-12-10T01:44:29  <McLeopold> sure, but I'm going to lose
2011-12-10T01:45:53  <bmh> just need to get properly LOS maintenence working

2011-12-10T01:55:14  <McLeopold> that will be more fun that waiting
2011-12-10T01:55:21  <McLeopold> what's your server name?

2011-12-10T01:56:13  <bmh> damn, got paired with Ben's bot
2011-12-10T01:56:34  <bmh> better!
2011-12-10T01:56:52  <McLeopold> I'm playing a game now...
2011-12-10T01:57:03  <bmh> yep, that's me
2011-12-10T01:57:05  <McLeopold> normally I timeout after about 100 moves
2011-12-10T01:57:23  <McLeopold> ohh, slowing down...
2011-12-10T01:57:42  <McLeopold> if it gets faster, it's cause your killing my ants :)
2011-12-10T01:58:00  <bmh> this bot zergs.
2011-12-10T01:58:08  <McLeopold> which one?
2011-12-10T01:58:17  <bmh> skynet, as of this morning
2011-12-10T01:59:43  <McLeopold> I have 41 ants total in my view, including enemy, that can't be good...

2011-12-10T02:46:13  <bmh> There are reasons that I don't use Python.
2011-12-10T02:46:54  <McLeopold> it was actually logical, I but a line that removed an unseen location form the list to check for in the wrong spot
2011-12-10T02:46:59  <janzert> not sure about starting hill distance on that map, but for sure total area and per player area are both too big
2011-12-10T02:47:08  <McLeopold> it was something
2011-12-10T02:47:30  <janzert> total area is just over the limit at 25935 and per player is at 12967.5

2011-12-10T03:22:35  <bmh> I got the a1k0n "hill defence" strategy working
2011-12-10T03:22:54  <McLeopold> okay, I'm on
2011-12-10T03:23:08  <McLeopold> and what is the hill defense strategy?
2011-12-10T03:23:54  <bmh> maximize the walking distance from each hill to the nearest square that isn't visible
2011-12-10T03:25:12  <McLeopold> oh, so don't keep ants close if not needed
2011-12-10T03:26:13  <bmh> why'd you time out against bj?
2011-12-10T03:27:16  <McLeopold> don't know
2011-12-10T03:27:28  <McLeopold> well, my code attempted to move an ant twice
2011-12-10T03:27:33  <McLeopold> don't know why
2011-12-10T03:27:49  <McLeopold> probably a future ant that got the wrong time value
2011-12-10T03:29:11  <bmh> future ants? What manner of sorcery is this!?
2011-12-10T03:32:17  <McLeopold> it's my way of avoiding game trees
2011-12-10T03:33:17  <McLeopold> look at that game I posted on paste where I lost to Hunter
2011-12-10T03:33:21  <McLeopold> http://paste.aichallenge.org/zyslQ/
2011-12-10T03:33:39  <McLeopold> turn on my visualizations, you can see 2 white lines coming from the hill to other food
2011-12-10T03:33:46  <bmh> oh, whoa. state
2011-12-10T03:33:49  <McLeopold> those are ants that will spawn
2011-12-10T03:34:05  <bmh> I don't do any planning.
2011-12-10T03:34:27  <McLeopold> I looks more impressive with more food
2011-12-10T03:34:50  <McLeopold> I can plan for an ant to gather several food items, and you can see its path
2011-12-10T03:34:59  <McLeopold> it frees up other ants to do other things
2011-12-10T03:36:06  <bmh> I need to incorporate "distance from the hill" into my scores somehow
2011-12-10T03:37:01  <McLeopold> just wait until I get my quantum ants working :)

2011-12-10T10:44:45  <antimatroid> so my game is really 2x2
2011-12-10T10:45:13  <antimatroid> although it's written so i can just throw more sets of moves in if i want/can afford the time

2011-12-10T11:03:52  <Fluxid> Anilm3: 4x5
2011-12-10T11:04:50  <Anilm3> Fluxid: 4x5 what?
2011-12-10T11:04:54  <Fluxid> matrix
2011-12-10T11:05:00  <Fluxid> or whatever
2011-12-10T11:05:05  <Fluxid> at least ATM
2011-12-10T11:05:14  <Anilm3> I'm lost
2011-12-10T11:05:33  <hkraal_> Fluxid dont you mean antimatroid ?
2011-12-10T11:05:50  <Fluxid> uh
2011-12-10T11:05:54  <Fluxid> right!
2011-12-10T11:05:59  <hkraal_> good morning ;)
2011-12-10T11:06:05  <Anilm3> it all makes sense now
2011-12-10T11:06:16  <Fluxid> sorry, an[tab] ;)
2011-12-10T11:06:21  <hkraal_> ghehe
2011-12-10T11:06:23  <Fluxid> antimatroid: i use 4x5
2011-12-10T11:06:35  <antimatroid> that's a strange number?
2011-12-10T11:07:07  <Fluxid> i consider 4 moves of enemy and halt, and four own moves
2011-12-10T11:07:17  <Fluxid> so for enemy it gives 5 options
2011-12-10T11:07:46  <thestinger> Fluxid: ah, I need to switch to something like that :)
2011-12-10T11:07:55  <thestinger> when I tried before my bot became too cautious
2011-12-10T11:07:55  <antimatroid> Fluxid: normally you are the row player :P
2011-12-10T11:08:01  <Fluxid> but what i have now isn't real payoff matrix or whatever, i'm trying to implement it now
2011-12-10T11:08:03  <thestinger> I have to keep it stupid and ignorant or it won't attack...
2011-12-10T11:08:23  <Fluxid> antimatroid: i never had this area of game theory on uni
2011-12-10T11:08:24  <thestinger> or I could change the way kills/deaths are weighted
2011-12-10T11:08:40  <antimatroid> the game theory being used here is fairly basic :P
2011-12-10T11:08:46  <antimatroid> but that's just convention
2011-12-10T11:08:50  <Fluxid> so i'm using terms learned on this channel and wikipedia
2011-12-10T11:08:59  <antimatroid> imo the convention is WRONG when it comes to n>3 player games
2011-12-10T11:09:03  <antimatroid> n>2*

2011-12-10T11:20:49  <Extrarius> hrmm, would it be against the symmetry requirements to have a (for ex) 4-player map with translational symmetry and the top half and bottom half are the same but the bottom half is offset 1/2 player space to the left, so hive to hive would be a path like /\/
2011-12-10T11:21:33  <pairofdice> The mapgenerator uses that type AFAIK

2011-12-10T11:32:33  <besh> i see some bots shake their ants during standoffs. can i swap positions of two ants? (which is equivalent to not moving both ants)
2011-12-10T11:32:41  <rwest_> yes
2011-12-10T11:33:39  <besh> so i have to modify isOccupied() to include the case wher the ant will move in the future
2011-12-10T11:34:12  <besh> my bot never produces that kind of move
2011-12-10T11:34:17  <antimatroid> Extrarius: have you taken a look at how translationally symmetric maps are currently done?
2011-12-10T11:34:44  <antimatroid> things are basically picked such that translate^n(location) = location for all locations

2011-12-10T11:38:56  <pairofdice> besh, switching the locations of two ants is never strictly needed
2011-12-10T11:39:21  <Anilm3> how do you people mix combat with gathering food??
2011-12-10T11:41:07  <Anilm3> I'm very stuck with that
2011-12-10T11:41:12  <Anilm3> :-(

2011-12-10T11:42:57  <besh> Anilm3:  i do not mix them. I do combat first when it is clear i can kill some ants. Then foraging with remaing ants..
2011-12-10T11:43:25  <pairofdice> You don't get points for artistic aspects :)
2011-12-10T11:43:50  <Anilm3> besh: that's the strategy I was thinking about but I think it could be better if it could be mixed
2011-12-10T11:45:05  <besh> Well i used to do it based on priorites but it screws up combat if one of the ants flies away to gather food or even explore unseen tile.
2011-12-10T11:45:46  <Anilm3> haha I see
2011-12-10T11:46:20  <avdg> pairofdice: maybe some attention :p

2011-12-10T13:16:23  <Anilm3> haha
2011-12-10T13:17:20  <hkraal_> amstan_: I believe it works out to be a succes :)
2011-12-10T13:17:30  <amstan_> yep, cool stuff
2011-12-10T13:17:50  <amstan_> hkraal_: thanks for your initiative in getting this going
2011-12-10T13:18:08  <Anilm3> oh hkraal_ great job you too! xD
2011-12-10T13:18:14  <hkraal_> overal load is around 30%... so janzert can add quite a few more :D
2011-12-10T13:18:39  <besh> i am doing my testing on the official server now ;)
2011-12-10T13:18:50  <Anilm3> besh: what's your name on official?

2011-12-10T13:19:02  <hkraal_> amstan_: sure np... I really hate sweet hardware doing nothing
2011-12-10T13:19:04  <Anilm3> oh that's you!
2011-12-10T13:19:15  <a1k0n> does it work at all?
2011-12-10T13:19:21  <McLeopold> a little
2011-12-10T13:19:25  <a1k0n> heh
2011-12-10T13:19:34  <McLeopold> what do you do if an ant move is occupied?
2011-12-10T13:19:34  <besh> yeah i flood the server with 22 versions so far
2011-12-10T13:19:48  <McLeopold> I can only score 4 of the five positions
2011-12-10T13:19:54  <a1k0n> i don't consider it for that sample
2011-12-10T13:19:56  <McLeopold> or I have to move the other ant
2011-12-10T13:20:11  <McLeopold> but then, that move won't be picked as the best
2011-12-10T13:20:17  <a1k0n> right
2011-12-10T13:20:17  <McLeopold> and can't be incremented
2011-12-10T13:20:49  <a1k0n> so you give it a second-best move if it can't go its preferred way
2011-12-10T13:20:59  <hkraal_> McLeopold: what details on the servers do you want? :)
2011-12-10T13:21:00  <McLeopold> so, my bot does do well in 2v1
2011-12-10T13:21:25  <McLeopold> hkraal_: more from our perspective, what the plans are for finals
2011-12-10T13:21:42  <hkraal_> As I understand the finals will be run on Amazon
2011-12-10T13:22:39  <hkraal_> That to make sure to tampering can be done. For the time to the finals these extra servers are used to lower the time between games
2011-12-10T13:22:51  <hkraal_> *no tampering
2011-12-10T13:22:54  <bmh> I'd implement monte carlo combat, but I really don't want to implement "find the nearby ants"

2011-12-10T13:23:47  <McLeopold> turn on the visualizations
2011-12-10T13:24:06  <McLeopold> the magenta lines connect ant groups that I simulate individually
2011-12-10T13:24:17  <McLeopold> the blue lines are the suggested combat moves
2011-12-10T13:24:19  <besh> Do you think being more aggresive attacking hills is better with many players ?
2011-12-10T13:24:23  <McLeopold> a blue circle means hold
2011-12-10T13:25:19  <McLeopold> turn 27 has a best move as hold, when it should be south
2011-12-10T13:25:36  <McLeopold> also, I ignore 1v1 for now
2011-12-10T13:26:14  <McLeopold> the yellow/red highlights are using the simpler combat method to mark KILL and DIE squares
2011-12-10T13:26:29  <a1k0n> you also have the influence map stuff?
2011-12-10T13:26:33  <a1k0n> ah
2011-12-10T13:27:00  <a1k0n> what are the white circles around your hill?
2011-12-10T13:27:26  <McLeopold> hive count
2011-12-10T13:27:34  <McLeopold> to make sure I'm calculating it right
2011-12-10T13:27:46  <a1k0n> ah, nice
2011-12-10T13:28:06  <McLeopold> turn 34, I get it right, but I think the ants could have moved together
2011-12-10T13:28:40  <McLeopold> the stars are spots I can't see, but have possible food/hills
2011-12-10T13:29:06  <McLeopold> and, as you can see, I commit everything to razing hills, and don't have defense :)  (which is really bad, btw)
2011-12-10T13:29:10  <a1k0n> neat
2011-12-10T13:29:20  <McLeopold> so, what's my problem? :P
2011-12-10T13:30:09  <McLeopold> oh, and my score is just ant count differences
2011-12-10T13:30:15  <a1k0n> dunno.  clearly it really mispredicted turn 27 and not because of blocking
2011-12-10T13:30:39  <McLeopold> I can paste the D updates

2011-12-10T13:39:56  <McLeopold> a1k0n: what is weak attraction?
2011-12-10T13:40:06  <McLeopold> score higher if my ants are in groups?
2011-12-10T13:40:34  <bmh> McLeopold: all things being equal, prefer moves that pull your ants together
2011-12-10T13:42:19  <a1k0n> or towards enemies
2011-12-10T13:43:12  <McLeopold> hmm, it doesn't mess up when I change the scoring, but it takes a little longer, and my ant graph doesn't go down as much

2011-12-10T14:01:47  <BenJackson> I just happened to watch that corner
2011-12-10T14:01:55  <BenJackson> as my hill was saved over and over by suicides
2011-12-10T14:02:00  <McLeopold> BenJackson: is version 4 really old?
2011-12-10T14:02:24  <BenJackson> 4 Oct 30th 4:26am Deactivated: not in queue to play game 64.64   20 345 C++
2011-12-10T14:02:38  <BenJackson> 64.64 didn't mean then what it does now
2011-12-10T14:02:43  <BenJackson> probably
2011-12-10T14:02:44  <McLeopold> so, that's the version I'm playing on tcp?
2011-12-10T14:02:52  <BenJackson> on bmh's server
2011-12-10T14:03:07  <Anilm3> bmh: what's your server url?

2011-12-10T14:03:19  <besh> yes many bots have got stronger past couple of days. Top 100 is tough now
2011-12-10T14:03:46  <BenJackson> wow, you need 78.5 to get in the top 100
2011-12-10T14:04:28  <Anilm3> wow for me
2011-12-10T14:04:30  <a1k0n> FlagCapper just resubmitted
2011-12-10T14:04:40  <besh> i am doing what i can to get in there even though i was upto 35 some time back
2011-12-10T14:05:12  <McLeopold> a1k0n: do you think you'll make top 10?
2011-12-10T14:05:12  <BenJackson> so if those ranks were directly comparable, my V4 would be 783rd
2011-12-10T14:05:17  <BenJackson> I'm sure it was higher than that at the time
2011-12-10T14:05:18  <a1k0n> i'm in #10 right now, heh
2011-12-10T14:05:30  <McLeopold> oh, I thought you were at 20...
2011-12-10T14:05:37  <a1k0n> i had just resubmitted too

2011-12-10T14:06:05  <a1k0n> he didn't even try to capture my hill, he just picked off all my ants one by one
2011-12-10T14:06:15  <McLeopold> yeah, I saw that one
2011-12-10T14:06:21  <BenJackson> on the same map I'm getting such similar games that the same battles play out the same way at each hill
2011-12-10T14:06:23  <McLeopold> it looks chaotic
2011-12-10T14:07:10  <bmh> a1k0n: "flag capper" yeah right!

2011-12-10T14:14:46  <Anilm3> I may have to do something like that
2011-12-10T14:14:48  <bmh> what is flagcapper doing for combat?
2011-12-10T14:15:02  <McLeopold> well, it's a computer, so you have to do something with numbers
2011-12-10T14:15:09  <BenJackson> maybe if he's 16yo he's actually driving them all with a joystick
2011-12-10T14:15:12  <Anilm3> I suppose
2011-12-10T14:15:16  <BenJackson> using the video game reflexes of youth

2011-12-10T14:15:41  <besh> no one wants to talk serious today :)
2011-12-10T14:15:53  <McLeopold> okay, produce a list of adjacent ant pairs, the longer list wins

2011-12-10T14:17:53  <McLeopold> my combat method can only take out vowells...
2011-12-10T14:18:45  <BenJackson> now to make my bot detect words
2011-12-10T14:18:50  <BenJackson> and insert/remove letters to change the meaning
2011-12-10T14:19:13  <BenJackson> happy new year you say?  how about happy now bear?
2011-12-10T14:20:55  <Anilm3> McLeopold: how do you make your ants go to a distant hive all together?
2011-12-10T14:21:04  <McLeopold> bfs
2011-12-10T14:21:08  <g0llum> braille would only take an average of 4 ants per letter
2011-12-10T14:21:18  <Anilm3> at such distance?
2011-12-10T14:21:22  <McLeopold> sure
2011-12-10T14:21:35  <McLeopold> I search from the hive, pulling in all ants, so one search
2011-12-10T14:21:44  <Anilm3> that's great
2011-12-10T14:22:00  <McLeopold> actually, I search from all hives, pulling in the closest
2011-12-10T14:22:37  <Anilm3> doesn't that time out big maps?
2011-12-10T14:22:38  <BenJackson> but nobody speaks braille
2011-12-10T14:22:46  <McLeopold> no, it's really fast
2011-12-10T14:22:52  <McLeopold> it's just one paint of the map
2011-12-10T14:23:04  <Anilm3> I'll have to try that
2011-12-10T14:23:13  <McLeopold> do you have any pathfinding?
2011-12-10T14:23:25  <Anilm3> I have A* to each objective
2011-12-10T14:23:35  <Anilm3> from each ant
2011-12-10T14:23:48  <Anilm3> I think I'm going to reverse and do bfs from every objective
2011-12-10T14:23:49  <McLeopold> that is good for point to point, but I'm always sending multiples, so bfs gets them all
2011-12-10T14:24:00  <McLeopold> I search from food to ants
2011-12-10T14:24:10  <Anilm3> that's what I'm going to try, yes
2011-12-10T14:24:11  <McLeopold> so, multi-source to multi-target
2011-12-10T14:24:17  <Anilm3> it works great for what I've seen
2011-12-10T14:24:34  <McLeopold> for exploring, I search each ant, which is the slow stupid part
2011-12-10T14:24:48  <Anilm3> I have the same problem for exploring
2011-12-10T14:24:49  <McLeopold> I need some vision edge detection

2011-12-10T14:27:10  <bmh> McLeopold: why do you search each ant? For exploration I just do a BFS to all the unseen squares and all the unknown squares
2011-12-10T14:27:57  <pairofdice> That ends up with bad behavior
2011-12-10T14:27:57  <Anilm3> bmh: what are unknown squares?
2011-12-10T14:28:09  <bmh> Anilm3: ones that you haven't seen before
2011-12-10T14:28:24  <Anilm3> isn't that the same as unseen?
2011-12-10T14:28:40  <bmh> Anilm3: Unseen - can't see now, Unknown - never seen
2011-12-10T14:29:09  <BenJackson> I actually find the edge of the never-seen space
2011-12-10T14:29:12  <BenJackson> and bfs from that
2011-12-10T14:29:24  <Anilm3> oh, ok!
2011-12-10T14:29:28  <BenJackson> I don't know if the effort of edge-detecting it saves time or wastes time
2011-12-10T14:29:52  <Anilm3> BenJackson: and when everything is seen?
2011-12-10T14:30:07  <antimatroid> possible enemy border
2011-12-10T14:30:09  <pairofdice> Well, the perimeter is pretty important in many ways
2011-12-10T14:30:41  <BenJackson> Anilm3: I'm constantly trying to keep as much possible in sight

2011-12-10T14:30:54  <BenJackson> also over time my concept of unseen has varied from truly never seen to just "not seen recently"
2011-12-10T14:31:00  <antimatroid> BenJackson: you don't track where enemies might be?
2011-12-10T14:31:13  <pairofdice> Checking one horizontal neighbour and one vertical neighbour should be enough for edge detection
2011-12-10T14:31:20  <BenJackson> where enemies might be?
2011-12-10T14:31:43  <Anilm3> BenJackson: my exploration method tries to minimize not seen recently squares, but on mazes doesn't work well
2011-12-10T14:32:14  <antimatroid> BenJackson: start with everything as a possible enemy, anything that you see an isn't an enemy isn't a possible enemy, where enemies you see can move is a possible enemy and an enemy hill out of view spawns a possible enemy, then propogate the info each turn
2011-12-10T14:32:25  <antimatroid> then you can sort of set up a "perimeter" around your hills
2011-12-10T14:32:30  <antimatroid> where you don't actually need to keep visibility
2011-12-10T14:32:44  <BenJackson> neat idea
2011-12-10T14:32:50  <pairofdice> (particle filter)

2011-12-10T14:50:08  <BenJackson> eg a bfs starting from all of your ants gives you the distance to the closest ant from every square

2011-12-10T15:11:36  <BenJackson> all ants are going toward the closest goal
2011-12-10T15:11:43  <BenJackson> so once ants are clumped they stay clumped

2011-12-10T15:30:39  <ikaros> is that haskell?
2011-12-10T15:30:39  <Fluxid> what language is that
2011-12-10T15:30:52  <bmh> Haskell.
2011-12-10T15:30:54  <rwest_> my bot no longer wants to kill hills
2011-12-10T15:30:58  <rwest_> it just kills all other ants
2011-12-10T15:31:10  <Fluxid> this is not what i understand by just reading the code...
2011-12-10T15:31:10  <ikaros> sounds good too rwest :)

2011-12-10T15:33:01  <rwest_> I fail so hard for doing that
2011-12-10T15:33:09  <Anilm3> unfail then
2011-12-10T15:33:28  <ikaros> bmh, must admit i cant really read that :) the only thing ive done with haskell is factorial and such lol
2011-12-10T15:33:30  <rwest_> just did, I made the hill overwrite any value assigned to it after diffusion
2011-12-10T15:33:41  <rwest_> but that value I overwrote it with
2011-12-10T15:33:49  <rwest_> was lower than what was diffused around it

2011-12-10T15:33:53  <rwest_> so they just circled it
2011-12-10T15:35:37  <bmh> ikaros: it's really simple. I promise. It takes a vector of type a and returns a vector of type a
2011-12-10T15:36:14  <bmh> then it takes two functions on points, one to determine if a point should get searched, and another to determine if the neighbors of that point should be searched
2011-12-10T15:36:58  <bmh> The obscure part is that I'm constructing a queue inside the function :)
2011-12-10T15:37:21  <ikaros> its the syntax of haskell that makes me uncomfortable :)
2011-12-10T15:37:33  <ikaros> i know people love it.. but not me lol
2011-12-10T15:39:12  <rwest_> wanna see aweful syntax, you should try ZPL
2011-12-10T15:39:22  <rwest_> had to learn it for a parallel processing class

2011-12-10T16:52:54  <flowenol> indeed
2011-12-10T16:53:43  <rwest_> flowenol: I use a very similar approach to combat, it's not perfect but I am still tweaking
2011-12-10T16:54:10  <flowenol> my problem is understanding the implementation
2011-12-10T16:54:18  <flowenol> english not being my first language
2011-12-10T16:54:29  <flowenol> makes it a little hard to me
2011-12-10T16:54:34  <rwest_> I actually use hashmaps for it
2011-12-10T16:54:43  <flowenol> from what i see
2011-12-10T16:54:45  <rwest_> since keeping an array the size of the map seems like a waste
2011-12-10T16:54:51  <rwest_> you only need to know the combat tiles
2011-12-10T16:54:57  <flowenol> i noticed that
2011-12-10T16:55:01  <ikaros> theres enough memory
2011-12-10T16:55:01  <UncleVasya> McLeopold: Hi. Do you remember an idea with kill ratio? To show in the visualizer two numbers: 1. how many of my ants were killed during the game and 2. how many enemy ants were killed by my ants. Is it going to happen?
2011-12-10T16:55:04  <flowenol> the influence part seems simple
2011-12-10T16:55:33  <rwest_> I counts the influence of enemy vs my own ants
2011-12-10T16:55:39  <flowenol> just counts of what tiles can be affected
2011-12-10T16:55:41  <flowenol> mine or enemy
2011-12-10T16:55:49  <rwest_> yes
2011-12-10T16:55:50  <flowenol> but that fighting array
2011-12-10T16:55:57  <flowenol> in his last post hi says
2011-12-10T16:56:08  <rwest_> I didn't read the last post, sec
2011-12-10T16:56:18  <flowenol> rwest kk
2011-12-10T16:57:06  <ikaros> i thought i understood the fighting thing but still there seems something wrong in my implementation of it
2011-12-10T16:57:16  <ikaros> so i probably didnt
2011-12-10T16:57:27  <rwest_> I don't really get what he is saying there

2011-12-10T16:57:33  <rwest_> however I am not using that method exactly
2011-12-10T16:57:39  <rwest_> it's just very similar
2011-12-10T16:57:45  <rwest_> since my whole bot uses an influence map
2011-12-10T16:57:56  <flowenol> rwest_ diffusion like?
2011-12-10T16:58:00  <rwest_> yes
2011-12-10T16:58:07  <flowenol> thats what im using for movement
2011-12-10T16:58:14  <flowenol> but cant make it work with combat

2011-12-10T16:59:52  <rwest_> vs xathis for good comparison
2011-12-10T16:59:56  <rwest_> (he wins of course
2011-12-10T17:00:17  <rwest_> rossxwest2 is my bot
2011-12-10T17:01:32  <flowenol> holds pretty well
2011-12-10T17:02:08  <rwest_> tip: don't diffuse combat scores
2011-12-10T17:02:13  <rwest_> overlay them after diffusion
2011-12-10T17:02:47  <flowenol> i think i get it
2011-12-10T17:03:09  <flowenol> with influence
2011-12-10T17:03:09  <rwest_> because the scores shouldn't affect anything else
2011-12-10T17:03:21  <rwest_> and I actually make my ants attracted to enemy ants
2011-12-10T17:03:34  <flowenol> I already tried that too
2011-12-10T17:03:40  <flowenol> but i was difusing
2011-12-10T17:03:57  <flowenol> so if my ants had numerical advantage i was sending them to enemys
2011-12-10T17:04:12  <rwest_> I make them attracted, but then they get close and the tiles close to the ants have combat scores
2011-12-10T17:04:14  <flowenol> a stupid way and worked pretty bad
2011-12-10T17:04:22  <rwest_> so they won't suicide on them 1 by 1
2011-12-10T17:04:37  <flowenol> i see
2011-12-10T17:04:46  <flowenol> so thats why the overlay
2011-12-10T17:04:51  <rwest_> yea
2011-12-10T17:05:04  <flowenol> interesting
2011-12-10T17:06:57  <flowenol> i think i understand what memetix says

2011-12-10T18:13:00  <BenJackson> my combat may just be too ant-inefficient though
2011-12-10T18:13:25  <bmh> BenJackson: do you have a bot better than v4 but still not your best that you can run on my server? :)
2011-12-10T18:13:32  <BenJackson> hahah
2011-12-10T18:13:48  <rwest_> I would like that too :)
2011-12-10T18:13:55  <Anilm3> that was interesting
2011-12-10T18:14:08  <BenJackson> V4 to V5 on aichallenge was score 64.64 to score 78.19
2011-12-10T18:14:15  <BenJackson> that's a pretty big jump
2011-12-10T18:14:15  <AntDroid> my problem is not combat at the moment. my ants keep clumping together on defending
2011-12-10T18:14:19  <_flag> pguillory: I noticed the same thing, xathis' new bot has been giving me a beating as well
2011-12-10T18:14:28  <AntDroid> can't find a way to de-clump them
2011-12-10T18:14:35  <rwest_> BenJackson: run em both? :)
2011-12-10T18:14:44  <bmh> BenJackson: 'eh, whatever. Can you run v5? v4 is no longer a threat
2011-12-10T18:14:59  <Anilm3> the finals are going to be interesting
2011-12-10T18:15:19  <BenJackson> ok, v4 and v5 both playing
2011-12-10T18:15:26  <antimatroid> BenJackson: did i convince you to implement possible enemies? :P\
2011-12-10T18:15:34  * antimatroid awakes
2011-12-10T18:15:36  <BenJackson> antimatroid: it's an interesting idea
2011-12-10T18:15:54  <antimatroid> i'm actually quite surprised you aren't doing that
2011-12-10T18:16:11  <antimatroid> i would have expected that to be standard near the top?
2011-12-10T18:16:34  <BenJackson> mostly you need vision in your territory anyway just for food
2011-12-10T18:16:49  <BenJackson> but I can see it being useful in early games and low food games when you do lose sight of things
2011-12-10T18:17:16  <antimatroid> it makes you care less about some not visible squares
2011-12-10T18:17:25  <antimatroid> so i think you could wait longer before reexploring for food
2011-12-10T18:17:41  <BenJackson> well my working version is less dense than the one on aichallenge
2011-12-10T18:17:50  <BenJackson> so ants for visibility isn't a big deal
2011-12-10T18:18:04  <BenJackson> I was inspired by someone's endgame
2011-12-10T18:18:07  <BenJackson> not sure if chrish or pguillory

2011-12-10T18:20:01  <pguillory> BenJackson: oh yeah, that game was kind of embarrassing actually, because of the way it fed single ants into your wall instead of assaulting it en masse
2011-12-10T18:20:24  <pguillory> in reference to the game you linked
2011-12-10T18:20:27  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-12-10T18:20:42  <BenJackson> I've noticed that a lot of games would end differently if they'd go a bit longer
2011-12-10T18:20:54  <BenJackson> someone does have the upper hand but it's taking time

2011-12-10T18:24:03  <BenJackson> good news is v5 beats v4 every time
2011-12-10T18:24:16  <BenJackson> right now I'm stuck trying to make v11 beat v10 similarly
2011-12-10T18:24:58  <rwest_> BenJackson: making a couple quick changes
2011-12-10T18:25:25  <rwest_> running again
2011-12-10T18:25:58  <rwest_> had to fix my timeout and optimize recalculating battle map after each ant move

2011-12-10T19:05:39  <AntDroid> my current tcpclient seems not to end my bot process properly. any ideas? the previous tcpclient i've downloaded on the forums was working fine before but I've downloaded the latest tools and i've replaced it with the new one from fluxid
2011-12-10T19:06:07  <Vaenom> Given an origin/radius, both functions doesn't always consider the same tiles as being in the 'circle' and I can't figure out why

2011-12-10T19:36:26  <Vaenom> BenJackson: hmm, the modulus things seems to work pretty good aside from this issue.  In this http://imgur.com/kivB7 , the AddPresence is used to select the tile that fits in the radius2, while the other function is used to determine ant proximity (to collate them in group). As you can see at the top-right, the 2 functions doesn't agree about one of the ants and the collation system fails to group the 4 ants into a battle...

2011-12-10T19:45:43  <BenJackson> btw the combat radius isn't combatradius + 2

2011-12-10T19:49:04  <BenJackson> er manhattan steps, sorry
2011-12-10T19:49:20  <BenJackson> combat and view radius are euclidean (sqrt(x^2+y^2) distances)
2011-12-10T19:49:26  <BenJackson> movement is manhattan (steps n/s/e/w)
2011-12-10T19:49:38  <BenJackson> when people say "combat radius + 2"
2011-12-10T19:49:44  <BenJackson> the 2 is because they could move and you could move
2011-12-10T19:50:04  <BenJackson> so a...b could become a.b
2011-12-10T19:50:12  <McLeopold> attack radius = 5

2011-12-10T19:51:50  <Vaenom> aw, I see. You saw the large radius on the pic and guessed I used it for combat.
2011-12-10T19:52:11  <Vaenom> but it's only for pre-combat aggregation
2011-12-10T19:52:49  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-10T19:53:44  <Vaenom> I get what you're saying and I'll apply that in my combat code when I'll soon get there
2011-12-10T19:53:48  <janzert> Hey McLeopold could you review some sql changes
2011-12-10T19:53:53  <McLeopold> sure
2011-12-10T19:54:01  <McLeopold> already committed?
2011-12-10T19:54:06  <janzert> the first one is
2011-12-10T19:54:22  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/b3eeacece8c645c033c13483484367bdb0123a4a
2011-12-10T19:54:30  <janzert> does that do what I think it does ;)
2011-12-10T19:54:42  <janzert> and is there a better faster way to do that query
2011-12-10T19:55:03  <janzert> specifically I'm trying to get the percentage of bots that timeout or crash on each worker
2011-12-10T19:55:10  <McLeopold> can we move that to the sql.php file?
2011-12-10T19:55:25  <janzert> :( I'd rather not, sql.php is such a pain
2011-12-10T19:55:31  <McLeopold> I know I didn't get everything over there yet, but the more the merrier
2011-12-10T19:55:36  <janzert> but if you really want to, I don't expect to touch it again
2011-12-10T19:55:56  <McLeopold> I did it so that when we move to django, it is easier to do the orm
2011-12-10T19:56:08  <McLeopold> it can wait
2011-12-10T19:56:22  <McLeopold> ok reading...
2011-12-10T19:56:45  <janzert> I really don't like the idea of sql.php since it breaks locality of code and ends up as a huge mixed up file of queries
2011-12-10T19:57:17  <BenJackson> when you move to django you can do some pretty complex queries right on a QuerySet
2011-12-10T19:57:41  <CIA-53> aichallenge: janzert epsilon * r82bd445 / sql/2_generate_matchup.sql : Shorten or eliminate race in choosing a seed - http://git.io/-3BoKg
2011-12-10T19:57:43  <McLeopold> it is ugly, but at some point you just want the sql to go away and be able to write a getData() call
2011-12-10T19:57:47  <janzert> and that is the second change
2011-12-10T19:58:42  <McLeopold> janzert: I think you can get the player counts per game from the map table instead
2011-12-10T19:58:56  <McLeopold> then you don't need a group by
2011-12-10T19:59:10  <janzert> ahh, probably
2011-12-10T19:59:31  <janzert> really I don't even need the players per game at all
2011-12-10T19:59:37  <janzert> just the total for that worker
2011-12-10T20:00:56  <McLeopold> I think the datetime check is probably the slow part, but there is no way around that
2011-12-10T20:01:12  <McLeopold> we can add an index with status and timestamp to make it faster
2011-12-10T20:01:54  <janzert> is there a way to get the min game_id that is within 30 minutes then use that everywhere instead of the explicit timestamp check?
2011-12-10T20:02:19  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-12-10T20:02:35  <janzert> if I had a game_id then the inner queries wouldn't even have to join against the game table
2011-12-10T20:02:55  <McLeopold> I was doing some stuff in api_game_result.php to avoid some of that stuff per player, but I dropped its use
2011-12-10T20:03:42  <McLeopold> we have an index for timestamp on game, just do a limit 1 query and save it to a var
2011-12-10T20:03:48  <McLeopold> I think that should be fast
2011-12-10T20:04:05  <McLeopold> mysql is horrible at recognizing inner queries that don't change
2011-12-10T20:04:27  <McLeopold> I was so used to mssql before this where everything "just works"
2011-12-10T20:04:43  <janzert> can the var be set in the outer query and be accessible to the inner ones?

2011-12-10T20:06:54  <McLeopold> select * from table where game_id >= @max_game_id, (select @max_game_id = (query)) max_query
2011-12-10T20:07:34  <McLeopold> the query is run once as a table a joined, then you use the value everywhere
2011-12-10T20:07:42  <McLeopold> I used it in other places
2011-12-10T20:08:54  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/sql/2_generate_matchup.sql#L80
2011-12-10T20:09:13  <McLeopold> the t table is an example of a query to select a value once, then use it other places
2011-12-10T20:09:43  * McLeopold starts writing a bot in mysql...
2011-12-10T20:10:03  <janzert> except the value is only used in the outer query there
2011-12-10T20:10:30  <janzert> anyway the matchup insert change is the more important one
2011-12-10T20:10:50  <janzert> we're getting almost 20% duplicated seeds now
2011-12-10T20:11:54  <BenJackson> due to race condition?
2011-12-10T20:12:15  <janzert> pretty sure, yes
2011-12-10T20:12:56  <McLeopold> janzert: I think the real fix is transactions
2011-12-10T20:13:06  <McLeopold> I just don't know if that is going to do it
2011-12-10T20:13:44  <McLeopold> why don't we instead write a server site script to keep a constant connection and keep the matchup count high
2011-12-10T20:14:19  <McLeopold> I would feel more confidant doing that than changing the sql
2011-12-10T20:14:22  <janzert> certainly the real fix is transactions but that entails a database change
2011-12-10T20:14:41  <McLeopold> right, lets put effort into a manager instead of tweaking this
2011-12-10T20:14:51  <janzert> this puts the seed select and instert in one statement
2011-12-10T20:14:57  <janzert> insert
2011-12-10T20:15:23  <McLeopold> yeah, it should work still
2011-12-10T20:15:49  <janzert> I have to make sql changes anyway soon
2011-12-10T20:16:00  <McLeopold> I need to go.  I can look at stuff more carefully in about 5-6 hours
2011-12-10T20:16:02  <janzert> to the pairing that is
2011-12-10T20:16:05  <janzert> ok
2011-12-10T20:16:26  <janzert> I'll probably take it live and then back it out if there is a problem

2011-12-10T21:31:27  <thestinger> so
2011-12-10T21:31:42  <thestinger> a friend of mine was hacked today (drive-by browser exploit)
2011-12-10T21:32:04  <thestinger> wasted all day figuring out how it worked and what the payload/keylogger did (yay for VMs!)
2011-12-10T21:32:18  <thestinger> anyway it's a java 7 exploit, and it worked on windows 7 with chrome as the browser
2011-12-10T21:33:24  <thestinger> kind of scary.... it looks like they bought the exploit or something and you just provide code to run in the html of the page
2011-12-10T21:34:13  <thestinger> anyway that's why you don't click random links you get over IM (that's what he did...)
2011-12-10T21:39:21  <thestinger> I should try plugging in a different payload to see if this works in a linux VM
2011-12-10T21:39:36  <antimatroid1> lol, i swear you have to try and get an im virus
2011-12-10T21:43:26  <thestinger> well
2011-12-10T21:43:29  <thestinger> it's a drive-by exploit
2011-12-10T21:43:54  <thestinger> and it worked in fully up to date java 7, windows 7 and chrome
2011-12-10T21:44:14  <thestinger> the .jar was already on VirusTotal and detected by most of the AV scanners
2011-12-10T21:45:37  <thestinger> but AV doesn't stop your browser from running something in the java plugin :P

2011-12-10T22:23:58  <ChrisH_> take a look at this game:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=186986&user=10
2011-12-10T22:24:39  <ChrisH_> there were no timeouts, but I see very suspicious behavior of my bot.
2011-12-10T22:24:44  <ChrisH_> go to turn 17
2011-12-10T22:25:00  <ChrisH_> and step to turn 18
2011-12-10T22:25:18  <ChrisH_> notice that my ant at 17,27 doesn't move
2011-12-10T22:25:36  <ChrisH_> that shouldn't happen given the board situation
2011-12-10T22:26:14  <ChrisH_> with only 6 ants and no combat yet my bot should finish a turn in around 30 ms
2011-12-10T22:26:28  <ChrisH_> and with that much unexplored space every ant should move
2011-12-10T22:27:50  <ChrisH_> and if you play the game forward you will notice a lot of my ants pausing for a turn or two, and they are always the ants closest to hills, which are the last ones to get their moves computed, so the only rational explanation I have is that my bot isn't getting computing resources similar to what i have come to expect
2011-12-10T22:28:30  <ChrisH_> and yet it is still avoiding a timeout, which means it is getting enough time to check the clock and bail out with <40ms to go
2011-12-10T22:29:00  <ChrisH_> not sure what to make of it, but something isn't right
2011-12-10T22:29:25  <janzert> could you give me some sort of test program based off your bot to benchmark the workers?
2011-12-10T22:29:37  <janzert> I could try comparing some of the workers with that
2011-12-10T22:29:52  <ChrisH_> what do you have in mind?
2011-12-10T22:30:34  <ChrisH_> I could make my bot spit out some stats to stderr if that's what you want, it could print out how long it thinks each turn is taking
2011-12-10T22:31:06  <janzert> basically your bot with some static input built in and it can output how long it took to compute all the mvoes
2011-12-10T22:31:43  <ChrisH_> sure, we could use my existing code with a couple command line options I have for testing
2011-12-10T22:31:58  <ChrisH_> and just pipe in the input for any game

2011-12-10T22:32:46  <pguillory> look at turn 444 on that game
2011-12-10T22:33:18  <pguillory> err nm
2011-12-10T22:33:37  <pguillory> was just scanning for other cases where they were getting stuck
2011-12-10T22:34:37  <pguillory> do you really bail before issuing orders if time is almost up?  that's intriguing :)
2011-12-10T22:35:21  <ChrisH_> so get the bot input for my bot from the game I just linked and run my bot with:  MyBot -test -v=1 <bot.input 2>test.txt >o.txt and grep through test.txt for "Orders sent in" to get ms timings of each turn
2011-12-10T22:35:46  <ChrisH_> pguillory: no I don't bail, I just stop computations and send the orders decided on so far
2011-12-10T22:36:03  <pguillory> ah
2011-12-10T22:37:02  <ChrisH_> pguillory: another example is turn 59-60
2011-12-10T22:37:11  <ChrisH_> i mean 58-59
2011-12-10T22:37:47  *** TheLinker <TheLinker!~TheLinker@host142.190-227-156.telecom.net.ar> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye)
2011-12-10T22:37:51  <ChrisH_> the three ants near my hill in the upper left all pause
2011-12-10T22:38:18  <ChrisH_> and there are several more pauses over the next several turns
2011-12-10T22:41:36  <pguillory> noticed it near enemy hills as well, that a factor?
2011-12-10T22:41:42  <ChrisH_> but what's really telling about the turn 17-18 pause is my bot hasn't learned very much new on turn 18 that would cause the paused ant to move again on turn 19, no new hills, food, or enemy ants are discovered, just a little fog of war pushed back, so it doesn't make sense for the ant to stop moving and the suddenly restart
2011-12-10T22:42:23  <ChrisH_> pguillory: on what turn?
2011-12-10T22:42:33  <pguillory> 550
2011-12-10T22:43:09  <pguillory> at location 47:49
2011-12-10T22:43:15  <pguillory> 47:79 i mean
2011-12-10T22:43:38  <ChrisH_> the stretch of turn 125 - 140 are really noticable
2011-12-10T22:44:27  <pguillory> would seem odd to do any kind of ordering by distance from a razed enemy hill
2011-12-10T22:46:55  <ChrisH_> no, those three ants should be headed straight back to fight the blue ants at the end of the hallway where it is currently a 4-on-2 in favor of blue
2011-12-10T22:47:45  <ChrisH_> my bot finds the closest ant-target pairs first, so the farther an ant is from a suitable target, the later in the processing it's move gets decided
2011-12-10T22:48:03  <pguillory> gotcha
2011-12-10T22:49:07  <ChrisH_> so I'm used to seeing newly spawned ants far from the action do this sort of thing on a big map with lots of combats and ants to move, but this game is not on a big board and the pauses are happening early in the game, so it is unexpected
2011-12-10T22:49:53  <ChrisH_> I will have to download the game input and verify that these ants are actually getting orders if CPU time is available, that would be telling
2011-12-10T22:51:20  <ChrisH_> pguillory: BTW, I'm really curious about your combat logic, I hope you share it once the competition is over.
2011-12-10T22:52:20  <pguillory> sure i'll do that, probably post everything on the last day
2011-12-10T22:52:25  <pguillory> hopefully others will as well
2011-12-10T22:52:47  <pguillory> it would be neat to read other people's techniques while watching them be put into action in the finals
2011-12-10T22:52:52  <janzert> after submissions close and while the finals are running is probably a good time to discuss bot workings
2011-12-10T22:53:46  <pguillory> i expect interest in after-action reports to dwindle after the finals end
2011-12-10T22:59:18  <ChrisH_> janzert: I downloaded the game input for the one I linked and ran it through the version of my bot my current submission uses and indeed it emits orders to move the ants that I see not moving in the game. In particular on turn 17 it emits the order "17 27 W" for an ant that doesn't move in the replay and completes that turn in 33ms on my machine.
2011-12-10T23:01:11  <ChrisH_> janzert: if you are going to do the test you were suggesting, then I have a correction, grep for "orders sent in" on the stderr stream of my bot running with the -v=1 option to see my turn timings

2011-12-10T23:06:25  <Vaenom> Do you think it'd be worth it to have more than one ant contest? Do you guys think there could be enough bot evolution/tuning potential for a second and a third round?
2011-12-10T23:08:21  <ChrisH_> I think a lot of people could make their bots better given more time, but personally I've hit a bit of a wall.  I have one idea I'm working on right now that might have some benefit on certain maps, but I haven't been able to make any big leaps in my ant's quality over the last two weeks.
2011-12-10T23:08:36  <Vaenom> I'm not suggesting that org shouldn't develop other challenges following this one, but since everything to run ants contest is already developed and running, it could get a life of its own?
2011-12-10T23:09:43  <ChrisH_> So, I'm currently in the top 5, and I see other bots catching up to the top, but I don't know how much more improvement the top bots can make without significant effort. I think (but could be wrong) that the top bots are hitting the diminishing returns wall.
2011-12-10T23:09:59  <janzert> usually tcp server usage peters out after about a month
2011-12-10T23:10:10  <Vaenom> ChrisH_, I see
2011-12-10T23:12:03  <Vaenom> So many of the contest #1 tops wouldn't be that much interested in a second contest. But since the challenge is about learning and since there's always new comers, it be great if the contest could become permanent with 4 seasons a year. Think of it as the "Basic" of AI  :)
2011-12-10T23:12:47  <Vaenom> janzert: yea, but they aren't as exciting as the center stage..
2011-12-10T23:13:04  <pguillory> very rapidly diminishing returns at this point
2011-12-10T23:13:08  <ChrisH_> I was analyzing a one-on-one game I had against BenJackson recently in which my bot won, and in the end it looked decisive, but when you step through the game and look for what my bot did better, it boiled down to a couple of lucky food spawns that I was closer to and a few combat situations that my bot handled better. Those deltas resulted in about a 7-8 ant advantage for me in the mid game and my bot used that advantage to gain
2011-12-10T23:13:47  <Vaenom> there's so much effort going on to make this contest possible.. I really think it would deserve permanence on the web.
2011-12-10T23:14:08  <Vaenom> janzert: do you see any reason to not do it?
2011-12-10T23:14:25  <pguillory> it really is a fun event and a great experience for everyone involved
2011-12-10T23:14:30  <ChrisH_> I think that if it didn't have an end we would all burn out and it would just fizzle instead of building to an exiciting finals.

2011-12-10T23:19:18  <janzert> since if anything it's probably temporary changes in performance is my guess
2011-12-10T23:20:11  <Vaenom> janzert: as for the resources, I feel this could be worked out but I obviously don't know all the metrics and challenges, so..
2011-12-10T23:20:55  <pguillory> would it be possible to make an AWS image that people could start to contribute computing resources?
2011-12-10T23:20:57  <ChrisH_> janzert: I was wondering if there could be anything odd about the behavior of the system timer on any of the boxes. the fact that my bot didn't timeout suggests to me that it thought it had less time than it really did and sent orders too early, if it truely wasn't getting CPU time I would expect a timeout because I only allow 40ms of overhead time
2011-12-10T23:21:59  <janzert> pguillory: only if they withdrew from the contest and we trusted them completely to not change results or leak contestant code
2011-12-10T23:22:00  <Wraithan> 40ms of overhead is a lot of time.
2011-12-10T23:22:43  <janzert> ChrisH_: not that I know of but *shrug*
2011-12-10T23:22:56  <Vaenom> The workers could detect performance problems and end/void the games that suffered from them. It probably would be easy to implement. but maybe I drank a Red Bull too much.   think I'll go back to my rank 600 code .. :P
2011-12-10T23:23:22  <Wraithan> In python, in a iterative recursive algorithm I can get 1.2 million calls to the function in 400ms,
2011-12-10T23:23:41  <ChrisH_> Wraithan: yes, but on we are analyzing a situation in which a game my bot played on the server resulted in ants that my bot wanted to move didn't get moved.
2011-12-10T23:23:49  <pguillory> janzert: i was thinking with SSH disabled, not sure how tamper proof it's possible to make such a thing though
2011-12-10T23:24:23  <ChrisH_> And when I run the same game on my machine the whole turn took 33ms, and it tried to move the ant that the server didn't move.
2011-12-10T23:25:10  <janzert> pguillory: since we update worker code semi-regularly and unpredictably we also still need a way to reset the VM basically
2011-12-10T23:25:22  <ChrisH_> So, knowing my bot's code I know that the ant in question would be the last one my code would figure the moves for, but it is also checking the system time between each ant, so it could do that and think time was up and just send the orders for the first ants.
2011-12-10T23:25:38  <bmh> bj_v5 frags me right and proper.
2011-12-10T23:26:15  <ChrisH_> But that should only happen if my bot has taken 460 ms so far, and there are only two explanations for that, either it didn't get the CPU time it should have for 430 ms, or the system timer lied.
2011-12-10T23:26:36  <janzert> ChrisH_: "orders sent in" doesn't appear anywher in the stderr output
2011-12-10T23:26:57  <ChrisH_> janzert: did you give the command line options "-test -v=1" ?
2011-12-10T23:27:11  <janzert> I copied and pasted the line above

2011-12-10T23:28:50  <ChrisH_> can you paste the beginning of the test.txt file somewhere for me to see?
2011-12-10T23:29:05  <janzert> well, actually needed ./ at the beginning as well
2011-12-10T23:29:11  <ChrisH_> yeah

2011-12-10T23:32:13  <ChrisH_> ok, that looks right, but it's a capitalization issue I think, try "Orders sent in" I forgot that I changed that spelling recently from what it was with my V5.
2011-12-10T23:32:51  <ChrisH_> or you can just grep for "sent in"
2011-12-10T23:33:22  <janzert> ok, no easy way to tell what turn is what. but the first 100 turns appear to be under 100ms
2011-12-10T23:33:59  <ChrisH_> yeah, I added the turn number on that line since the version online, but you could check the line number if you open it in an editor
2011-12-10T23:34:06  <janzert> range seems to be 28-75ms
2011-12-10T23:34:50  <ChrisH_> that's sounds reasonable, the first turn is usually a bit longer and then it is in the 30-50ms range until combat occurs
2011-12-10T23:36:02  <janzert> hmm, first turn is 58, second is 28, 74 was down near 100
2011-12-10T23:36:27  <ChrisH_> now, open the o.txt file and find the 17th "go" line and show me the orders that follow
2011-12-10T23:36:59  <ChrisH_> janzert: that sounds completely normal
2011-12-10T23:38:22  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/jBNHgZhD
2011-12-10T23:39:49  <janzert> same as the actual game right?
2011-12-10T23:40:03  <ChrisH_> yeah, that's not what I expected
2011-12-10T23:41:06  <ChrisH_> I'm pretty sure I've got my versioning right, but maybe not, let me try one more time on my machine to make sure I didn't use the wrong version here.
2011-12-10T23:42:07  <janzert> btw, turn 17 in the test was 47ms

2011-12-10T23:47:32  <ChrisH_> janzert: can you try this for me:  "6g -V" to check the go compiler version?
2011-12-10T23:49:03  <janzert> sure, it's still the same as copying off the starter_packages page though
2011-12-10T23:49:04  <janzert> 6g version release.r60.1 9753+
2011-12-10T23:49:15  <ChrisH_> Ok
2011-12-10T23:50:09  <ChrisH_> I tried bot my V5 code and my V4 code, and both issue six orders on turn 17, with the extra one being o 17 27 W, I can't explain this.
2011-12-10T23:51:16  <janzert> the uploaded zip is ~30kb if you want it emailed to you

2011-12-10T23:56:14  <ChrisH_> janzert: I think we did eliminate the CPU or system timer as culprits at least, but I'm at a loss now.
2011-12-10T23:56:43  <ChrisH_> Especially because I don't see it in every game, or even every turn of the one game we were looking at.
2011-12-10T23:58:14  <janzert> ok, should be sent to your account email
2011-12-10T23:58:47  <janzert> yeah, intermittent things that only happen on the deployed version are a real pain :/
2011-12-10T23:59:32  <ChrisH_> especially when the part of the code in question is some of the oldest and most tested in my bot
