2010-11-13T00:01:25  <eburnette> what's one with close starting angle
2010-11-13T00:04:42  <eburnette> 201 is pretty close, is that one even legal?
2010-11-13T00:05:31  <antimatroid> it is
2010-11-13T00:05:44  <eburnette> ok that's strange, i took out all the defense code and it's still defending?!
2010-11-13T00:06:27  <antimatroid> legal requirements at the start are that at least one neutral is claimable by both players without losing their home planet to ragebot
2010-11-13T00:06:38  <antimatroid> although i think i'm in favour of increasing the min starting distance between players
2010-11-13T00:08:20  <eburnette> I guess defending is just attacking from a different point of view

2010-11-13T00:19:47  <eburnette> I took out that thing in my bot that was relying on a line between the starters running through center, no great loss
2010-11-13T00:19:58  <antimatroid> eburnette: :)
2010-11-13T00:20:13  <antimatroid> i really don't think it will change rankings, just gives more awesome maps
2010-11-13T00:21:21  <antimatroid> hmm, i'm unsure whether i like the idea of having a map generator set in stone at the start of future contests either
2010-11-13T00:21:35  <antimatroid> by the sounds of it, a lot of people are making their bots to do well on specific maps rather than general ones
2010-11-13T00:21:45  <eburnette> Ok here's what I think of these maps...
2010-11-13T00:21:59  <eburnette>  - they're awesome! I wish we'd had them sooner but my bot runs ok with them and there are 2 weeks left before the contest starts anyway.
2010-11-13T00:22:17  <antimatroid> :P, not a single person has said they don't actually like them
2010-11-13T00:22:37  <antimatroid> i was worried you were going to be the first for a second ehe
2010-11-13T00:23:17  <eburnette> I don't like 201, but almost all the others I tried were good
2010-11-13T00:23:30  <antimatroid> yeah i don't like 201 either
2010-11-13T00:23:42  <antimatroid> i originally set their min starting distance to 7, but people in here suggested removing that
2010-11-13T00:24:57  <eburnette> I'm not too fond of the ones that are reeeeeally spaced out like 104 but I guess there has to be a mix
2010-11-13T00:25:09  <antimatroid> 104 was done with the old generator :P
2010-11-13T00:25:27  <eburnette> lol
2010-11-13T00:25:53  <antimatroid> 100-200 all old
2010-11-13T00:25:53  <antimatroid> 201-300 line symmetric
2010-11-13T00:25:53  <antimatroid> 301-400 combinations
2010-11-13T00:26:13  <eburnette> looks like i'm doing worse on the 100-200 range actually
2010-11-13T00:26:49  <antimatroid> there seems to be quite a few maps in there with >23 planets
2010-11-13T00:27:51  <eburnette> 234 is a bit close for my tastes
2010-11-13T00:28:12  <antimatroid> yeah, i think min starting distance between players needs to be greater
2010-11-13T00:28:28  <eburnette> 236 is close but not too bad
2010-11-13T00:28:40  <antimatroid> 236 is good

2010-11-13T00:28:56  <eburnette> 259 looks like a ladybug
2010-11-13T00:29:08  <antimatroid> i had a space invader the other day, and a cock and ball
2010-11-13T00:29:09  <antimatroid> s
2010-11-13T00:29:13  <antimatroid> but they were from other generations
2010-11-13T00:30:07  <burny> I can't figure out how to make an AI.. I downloaded the "cpp starter", and it had ZERO c or cpp files in it? and the instructions given to use the test bots, just says "'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command" .. am I doing something wrong?
2010-11-13T00:30:09  <antimatroid> 277 looks like a catfish
2010-11-13T00:30:14  <antimatroid> the players home planets being the eyes
2010-11-13T00:30:46  <antimatroid> burny: edit your bot in MyBot.cc
2010-11-13T00:30:55  <antimatroid> and planetwars is your game state file
2010-11-13T00:31:21  <antimatroid> which i renamed to game state and completely rewrote cause it was rank
2010-11-13T00:31:50  <burny> what is a cc file?
2010-11-13T00:32:00  <antimatroid> no idea, but it works the same as a cpp one
2010-11-13T00:32:00  <eburnette> well you have my vote, good night (I just started a new bot on tcp - Houndoom)
2010-11-13T00:32:38  <antimatroid> night
2010-11-13T00:33:09  <burny> so is it just a fairly sloppy contest, that files are named wacky, and I have to have java, and other stuff, in order to do it in c++?
2010-11-13T00:34:00  <antimatroid> the contest isn't sloppy, it just lets people use many languages
2010-11-13T00:34:07  <antimatroid> and parts of the engine require java to run
2010-11-13T00:34:15  <antimatroid> your bot will just be running with c++
2010-11-13T00:34:43  <antimatroid> i have no idea why .cc was used, i'm just a student, i just go with a flow ;)

2010-11-13T00:36:17  <Zannick> only the client engine requires java
2010-11-13T00:36:18  <janzert> probable the reason the contest uses .cc is because that is the google styleguide way
2010-11-13T00:36:50  <antimatroid> janzert: :)
2010-11-13T00:37:01  <antimatroid> what are your current thoughts about the new maps?
2010-11-13T00:37:30  <antimatroid> as a whole, i think people like them
2010-11-13T00:37:38  <antimatroid> some are just worried about change
2010-11-13T00:37:53  <antimatroid> some == about half
2010-11-13T00:38:16  <janzert> I still mildly disapprove but don't mind whatever is decided
2010-11-13T00:38:37  <janzert> I would really like the decision made in the next day or so though
2010-11-13T00:38:59  <antimatroid> my understanding of both the tron contest and this one was that provided maps in way represent final maps
2010-11-13T00:39:05  <antimatroid> no way*
2010-11-13T00:39:25  <antimatroid> i might send an email through the discussions saying jeff, make a decision
2010-11-13T00:39:29  <antimatroid> would that be best do you think?
2010-11-13T00:39:53  <antimatroid> in the end he has to make the decision i think
2010-11-13T00:39:55  <janzert> yeah, point him at the forum thread and ask him to make a final call
2010-11-13T00:39:59  <janzert> yep
2010-11-13T00:42:22  <burny> for the submission, it has to have all the maps tools etc.? or just zip up the single source file?
2010-11-13T00:42:57  <janzert> it needs any files needed for your bot, so not the tools or maps or anything but all your source files

2010-11-13T01:25:25  <antimatroid> it's quite possible line symmetric maps will be used too
2010-11-13T01:25:33  <antimatroid> and varying number of planets etc.
2010-11-13T01:25:49  <antimatroid> they're more awesome
2010-11-13T01:27:02  <flag> interesting
2010-11-13T01:27:22  <flag> I hope they update it soon so it's not sprung on us right before the contest ends though
2010-11-13T01:27:29  <antimatroid> on the third page there is a link to 300, the first 100 are done with the original generator, the second 100 are line symmetric, and the last 100 is combinations
2010-11-13T01:27:43  <antimatroid> hopefully the decision will be made in the next 24 hours
2010-11-13T01:28:12  <antimatroid> although, the rules have always stipulated that the example maps aren't representative of all maps that may be used
2010-11-13T01:28:48  <antimatroid> besides, the strategy doesn't really change i don't think, they just provide more interesting games and more variety
2010-11-13T01:30:25  <flag> I think most people that are already doing well with these ones will be against it
2010-11-13T01:30:50  <antimatroid> the official server still only has the 100 maps that were handed out to everyone
2010-11-13T01:30:59  <antimatroid> that's the worst possible set to be trying to get rankings off
2010-11-13T01:31:37  <flag> I assumed that the ones on the tcp server were from the official one
2010-11-13T01:31:46  <antimatroid> there are more on tcp
2010-11-13T01:31:49  <antimatroid> but tcp has the offical ones
2010-11-13T01:32:30  <antimatroid> the starting maps are only ever provided as examples, i don't think many people caught that
2010-11-13T01:32:52  <flag> yes, but it looks like most people think its too late to change them

2010-11-13T01:48:58  <McLeopold> javascript can be sorta like lisp
2010-11-13T01:49:18  <janzert> at least some functional language should be learned since it will help you learn a new way to think about programs
2010-11-13T01:49:19  <McLeopold> it takes a mental jump to grok it

2010-11-13T01:55:27  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what do you think of the line symmetric map idea where all neutrals start in the "center"
2010-11-13T01:55:50  <antimatroid> it'd probably be hard to make such a map that didn't end up in a draw actually
2010-11-13T01:56:00  <McLeopold> so, 2 starting planets, and a line of planets?
2010-11-13T01:56:07  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-13T01:56:26  <McLeopold> it would be very unstable.  That type of map is closer to r/p/s than other ones.
2010-11-13T01:56:27  <antimatroid> but line symmetric, not point symmetric
2010-11-13T01:56:34  <antimatroid> that's my point :P
2010-11-13T01:57:20  <McLeopold> I think if a few line maps end up looking like that, that would be fine, but I wouldn't want a whole series of them.
2010-11-13T01:57:51  <antimatroid> no, i'm not even considering stuff like that for the contest

2010-11-13T02:02:30  <McLeopold> Also, it looks like you concentrated your attacks where as mega1 spammed you line.  Spamming is usually less effective.
2010-11-13T02:03:14  <mega1> I'm at a loss (:-)) how to concentrate attacks
2010-11-13T02:03:37  <McLeopold> The planet hopping you did to take the back growth 5 was good too.  You didn't hold it, but it gave you a ship advantage.
2010-11-13T02:03:40  * janzert aims a kick at the database. wake up over there and quit complaining
2010-11-13T02:03:46  <antimatroid> "(6:03:16 PM) mega1: I'm at a loss" that's a first :)
2010-11-13T02:04:11  <McLeopold> um, 1 enemy planet at a time?
2010-11-13T02:04:29  <McLeopold> Although, I still can't beat you, so I'm not one to talk.
2010-11-13T02:04:36  <mega1> I don't have much direct control over that.
2010-11-13T02:04:50  <McLeopold> really, why not?
2010-11-13T02:04:56  <mega1> there a many situation where that would hurt too
2010-11-13T02:05:15  <mega1> because behaviour comes from the evaluation function
2010-11-13T02:05:41  <McLeopold> oh, your minimax
2010-11-13T02:05:56  <mega1> yes, even if 1 ply
2010-11-13T02:06:22  <mega1> although I now have a 2 ply version that beats it 2 to 1 but is too slow
2010-11-13T02:06:26  <McLeopold> I suppose if it tells you to swap sides, then you can't argue.
2010-11-13T02:06:35  <mega1> yes
2010-11-13T02:06:50  <mega1> I may hack it still, but I'm not too keen on it.
2010-11-13T02:06:52  <McLeopold> But, none of your targets landed with success.
2010-11-13T02:07:21  <McLeopold> I suppose then, it thought the other bot would do something else.
2010-11-13T02:07:58  <McLeopold> I'm gonna have to try 1 ply something.  I can't see to get better position on you with just heuristics.
2010-11-13T02:08:20  <McLeopold> Let me start cranking up the games and see if we play.
2010-11-13T02:08:25  <McLeopold> on tcp...
2010-11-13T02:08:39  <mega1> I'm testing stuff locally, can't play now.

2010-11-13T02:19:30  <antimatroid> hmmm, that thing about infinite points on a circly, then extending those out to another cirlce and it not giving a continuous line is rather confusing
2010-11-13T02:30:06  <McLeopold> ?
2010-11-13T02:40:18  <antimatroid> if i use my generator, migi32 pointed out that the density of planets is going to be high around the centre
2010-11-13T02:40:39  <antimatroid> so one should use like sqrt(rand(0,1))*maxRadius for generating a random radius
2010-11-13T02:41:20  <antimatroid> but when you think about it, from a single point, you are just as likely to generate a random point on any circle centred around that point, but there is "more" points anyway the further out you go
2010-11-13T02:41:50  <antimatroid> i find that confusing anyway
2010-11-13T02:42:10  <antimatroid> it's like, the further you go out from a point, the more "space there is" but the same happens in the reverse etc.
2010-11-13T02:42:21  <burny> sqr rather than sqrt probably

2010-11-13T02:42:49  <antimatroid> we're tring to have them not clump up around the middle
2010-11-13T02:43:28  <McLeopold> you want a radius of 2 to be 4 times more likely to occur than a radius of 1

2010-11-13T02:48:09  <antimatroid> i can't see how the power could be greater than 1
2010-11-13T02:48:25  <burny> any idea how the top 10 AI's perform compared to a human player?
2010-11-13T02:48:28  <McLeopold> the circumference of radius 1 is 1*pi*2, and radius 2 is 2*pi*2
2010-11-13T02:48:41  <McLeopold> or 6.28 and 12.56
2010-11-13T02:48:45  <amstan> burny: so.. you know the AI from galcon? that can kick your ass in hard?
2010-11-13T02:48:49  <antimatroid> burny: the only way you're going to beat a top 50 bot is from ruining it on the first few moves
2010-11-13T02:49:00  <amstan> burny: it's somewhere in the last few pages
2010-11-13T02:49:04  <McLeopold> I would argue that twice as many planets at radius 1 than radius 2 would be even
2010-11-13T02:49:08  <McLeopold> whoops
2010-11-13T02:49:15  <McLeopold> twice as many at radius 2
2010-11-13T02:49:38  <burny> ah, i never tried the AI on galcon
2010-11-13T02:49:46  <burny> level10?
2010-11-13T02:49:52  <antimatroid> hand on, i'm so confused, at the moment it would calculate
2010-11-13T02:49:52  <antimatroid> r = sqrt(rand(0,1) )*maxRadi
2010-11-13T02:49:55  <antimatroid> what should it be?
2010-11-13T02:50:03  <amstan> http://www.galcon.com/flash/
2010-11-13T02:50:19  <CryBaby> space planets along the circumference using a minimum distance (arc) between planets
2010-11-13T02:50:36  <McLeopold> antimatroid: i'm thinking...
2010-11-13T02:50:44  <antimatroid> i don't think it needs to be perfect
2010-11-13T02:50:57  <antimatroid> i think even the sqrt fix would be fine, but i'll play around with things when i clean it up
2010-11-13T02:53:41  <burny> I just beat vl10 3 times in a row
2010-11-13T02:55:21  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I think you want log(rand(0,1),2)?
2010-11-13T02:56:57  <antimatroid> i'll try them both out after and see what the maps generated look like
2010-11-13T02:57:00  <antimatroid> i'm out for a while
2010-11-13T02:57:25  <McLeopold> sqrt will create more doughnut shaped maps
2010-11-13T02:57:40  <McLeopold> too much is taken from the center
2010-11-13T02:57:46  <antimatroid> yeah, okay
2010-11-13T02:58:31  <antimatroid> one could generate a in (0.5, 1) then use that for the whole map generating r=rand(0,1)^a*maxr

2010-11-13T03:57:15  <burny> ya, I'm just trying to get an idea of how good it has to be, to compete in the top bunch
2010-11-13T03:58:05  <antimatroid> they are far from optimal
2010-11-13T03:58:22  <antimatroid> it's a surprisingly intricate game
2010-11-13T03:58:33  <antimatroid> the slightest tweak of numbers completely changes the best strategy
2010-11-13T03:58:42  <antimatroid> compile that into a map with over 20 planets and it's insane
2010-11-13T03:58:43  <burny> ya,
2010-11-13T03:59:04  <burny> it's highly dependant on luck though(atleast the galcon one is)
2010-11-13T03:59:27  <antimatroid> maps in this are always symmetrical
2010-11-13T03:59:30  <burny> but in teh last 20games I did against the lvl10 ai, I only lost 1
2010-11-13T03:59:41  <burny> ah, so zero luck factor: cool
2010-11-13T04:00:18  <antimatroid> there can still be situations where there is not best move in pure strategies
2010-11-13T04:00:22  <antimatroid> but imo they are going to be quite rare
2010-11-13T04:01:00  <burny> well, the best move then, is just more complicated
2010-11-13T04:01:22  <burny> like, if you have a losing situation, and you determine that if other player plays well, they win no matter what..
2010-11-13T04:01:28  <antimatroid> once you're using mixed strategies, results aren't consistent
2010-11-13T04:01:29  <burny> you can still win
2010-11-13T04:02:00  <burny> as in the game of goe. you don't concede if the other player gets to place 5 stones before your first stone
2010-11-13T04:03:08  <burny> oh.. the only reason lvl10 difficulty is even hard, is cause it has more units than you do
2010-11-13T04:03:34  <antimatroid> that would explain why i couldn't own it before
2010-11-13T04:03:43  <antimatroid> it was going for a neutral near me, i waited and still lost
2010-11-13T04:04:15  <burny> ya,
2010-11-13T04:04:20  <burny> that's why I just lost another one
2010-11-13T04:04:39  <burny> it went for the same thing as me right off the start, and I sent my entire army
2010-11-13T04:04:51  <antimatroid> you do want to arrive just after them
2010-11-13T04:04:57  <antimatroid> so they waste their ships taking out neutral
2010-11-13T04:05:04  <antimatroid> also, i take it you've just started for this?
2010-11-13T04:05:12  <antimatroid> make sure you read how neutrals are resolved
2010-11-13T04:05:22  <antimatroid> there was a number of ways that could have been done
2010-11-13T04:06:06  <burny> ya, just starting now
2010-11-13T04:06:37  <burny> and yes, I arrived just after them, it was just on their side ofmiddle, and I sent slightly later

2010-11-13T05:59:13  <Frontier> burny: When you snipe a neutral make sure you can hold it until the planet produced twice the ships you lost on capturing. Otherwise you could just have let the enemy take it.
2010-11-13T06:13:01  <lavalamp_> Frontier: why does it matter? It doesn't cost anything (relatively speaking) to throw ships at the enemy, so any turn you own it and he doesn't is a net gain for you
2010-11-13T06:14:30  <Frontier> lavalamp_: Just keep your belief. The things I make up when I go through the park at night never failed me so far :p
2010-11-13T06:15:17  <lavalamp_> I can see it might be a bad idea to trade ships in some circumstances, but in my mind that's a separate issue :)
2010-11-13T06:15:23  <antimatroid> he said when sniping neutrals
2010-11-13T06:15:27  <antimatroid> is that expanding?
2010-11-13T06:15:48  <antimatroid> i have always disagreed with the term "sniping", i don't consider it any different to normal offense
2010-11-13T06:15:51  <lavalamp_> If you're sniping, by definition they took it first
2010-11-13T06:16:20  <lavalamp_> antimatroid: yeah, my code just looks for optimal time to take a planet, sniping is a side effect

2010-11-13T06:24:42  <lavalamp_> I think my code shouldn't take neutrals it doesn't think it can hold indefinitely

2010-11-13T11:32:49  <antimatroid> janzert: you about?
2010-11-13T11:32:52  <Frontier> i see there are compilers for lisp. and you are right, using good heuristics is the only way to keep anything below 1 second
2010-11-13T11:33:35  <Bobng> lisp isn't a script language.
2010-11-13T11:34:10  <Frontier> i always mix up script and interpreted :/
2010-11-13T11:34:33  <antimatroid> mega1: have your thoughts changed at all on including new maps?
2010-11-13T11:35:22  <antimatroid> i didn't expect to, and don't really want to be the one to make this decision, as i'm so obviously biased
2010-11-13T11:35:44  <lavalamp_> jeff didn't give a real answer? unfortunately that doesn't surprise me
2010-11-13T11:35:57  <antimatroid> his answer was for me to decide
2010-11-13T11:36:30  <lavalamp_> he meant for everyone?? I assumed you meant he said something like "use your best judgment"
2010-11-13T11:36:44  <Bobng> make an issue on the tracker for people to discuss it?
2010-11-13T11:36:51  <mega1> antimatroid: no, they haven't
2010-11-13T11:37:09  <lavalamp_> it's ridiculous; the contest organizers should make a decision and stick with it
2010-11-13T11:37:24  <antimatroid> he sort of said yes do it, but not completely
2010-11-13T11:37:33  <lavalamp_> and they should at least tell us max and min parameters that we need to be able to handle
2010-11-13T11:37:41  <antimatroid> I support this change. I think that almost anything would be better than the map generator that we have now. The current map generator is just something that I whipped up on the bus a couple months ago to create some non-trivial maps to test the first game engine. I didn't put much thought into creating maps that had interesting properties, and I always meant to circle back and create a better map generator.
2010-11-13T11:37:41  <antimatroid> Can I put you in charge of creating the new map gen? It sounds like you have studied the problem in much greater detail than I have. I will defer to your best judgement on all the decision points that you raised. Try to build some consensus in the community on each of the points, but if you can't reach consensus just make an executive decision. Like you said, getting it done fast is better than getting it done perfectly.
2010-11-13T11:37:49  <antimatroid> that's what he has said
2010-11-13T11:38:05  <antimatroid> so it's not for me to just pick waht i want, but i pretty much get executive decision if i want to make it
2010-11-13T11:38:12  <lavalamp_> holy cow
2010-11-13T11:38:14  <antimatroid> but i am way too biased for that i think
2010-11-13T11:38:32  <lavalamp_> yeah, no offense, but they should not be delegating that to contest participants
2010-11-13T11:38:58  <antimatroid> I'm going to say no, he has to go through and say yes or no to each point i raised
2010-11-13T11:39:33  <Frontier> haha, amazing. now try... and try hard not to make the map generator spit out maps that your bot runs well on ^^
2010-11-13T11:39:38  <lavalamp_> that sounds like the right thing for you to do...
2010-11-13T11:40:04  <lavalamp_> ideally they should write a new generator
2010-11-13T11:40:08  <antimatroid> Frontier: map generator will be publicly viewable and making random maps
2010-11-13T11:40:20  <antimatroid> it doesn't matter who writes it when it's open source
2010-11-13T11:40:29  <mega1> does he not have time at all? It's like half an hour to read through that topic.
2010-11-13T11:40:34  <mega1> and think it through too.
2010-11-13T11:41:12  <mega1> not all properties are apperant in the source code
2010-11-13T11:41:31  <Frontier> If your bot favours dense centers and your random maps have a lot of good planets in the center compared to what the current generator spits out that would be problematic. But I trust you to do it well.

2010-11-13T11:45:02  <Frontier> hmm, in what sense? less random, more template based -> "large map", "high growth map", "jump map", ...?
2010-11-13T11:45:06  <antimatroid> but i really really like the line symmetrical maps
2010-11-13T11:45:25  <antimatroid> they over a lot more variety
2010-11-13T11:45:28  <antimatroid> offer*
2010-11-13T11:45:35  <mega1> in my experience the line symmetrical maps tend to create stable fronts
2010-11-13T11:46:03  <mega1> even more than the point symmetrical ones.
2010-11-13T11:46:06  <antimatroid> one could set a minimum distance between players angles
2010-11-13T11:46:18  <antimatroid> but decisions need to be made now
2010-11-13T11:46:24  <Frontier> so games are more likely to end in draw with line symmetry than with circular symmetry?

2010-11-13T11:46:54  <mega1> no, not now. A long time ago.
2010-11-13T11:46:57  <antimatroid> but there usually isn't draws unless the maps are completely trivial
2010-11-13T11:47:15  <antimatroid> or you have near identical bots (different revisions of your own)
2010-11-13T11:49:43  <antimatroid> right, i responded
2010-11-13T11:49:57  <Frontier> So you are now discussing advanced features for the map generator, instead of only fixing the bugs. I know that my next bot relies on point symmetry. I would like to know if that changes :o)
2010-11-13T11:50:24  <antimatroid> that is what i want to change and mega1 doesn't
2010-11-13T11:50:34  <antimatroid> and that is why i'm too biased to make a decision :)

2010-11-13T11:51:39  <antimatroid> people whose bots rely on point symmetry made their own assumptions
2010-11-13T11:52:07  <antimatroid> it was never stated that maps would meet that criteria
2010-11-13T11:52:37  <Frontier> I made a lot of these assumptions. Like a game ends after turn 200, there are 23 planets max and things along the line ^^
2010-11-13T11:52:50  <antimatroid> yeah, bad idea :P
2010-11-13T11:53:08  <brx> fun: dropping symmetry alltogether and playing the game twice instead with swapped starting positions.

2010-11-13T11:53:29  <antimatroid> i don't think 200 will change

2010-11-13T11:53:43  <Frontier> brx: NOOO, my algorithm can only calculate enemy moves effectively, because they are symmetrical to mine
2010-11-13T11:54:02  <antimatroid> Frontier: the game is usually no longer symmetric after the first move?
2010-11-13T11:54:18  <antimatroid> they reserve the right to have non-symmetric maps
2010-11-13T11:54:22  <antimatroid> but i don't think that's a good idea
2010-11-13T11:54:44  <mega1> phew
2010-11-13T11:55:00  <Frontier> antimatroid: the first turn is my most important turn. i'm calculating far ahead there.
2010-11-13T11:55:00  <antimatroid> and my bot would probably timeout if planets were above 50 or 60
2010-11-13T11:55:29  *** mk453 <mk453!5771950f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.87.113.149.15> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-13T11:55:53  <antimatroid> mega1: don't think you'd do well with nonsymmetric?
2010-11-13T11:55:58  <antimatroid> i don't think anyone would
2010-11-13T11:56:14  <mega1> it would be a drawfest
2010-11-13T11:56:15  <antimatroid> it's very hard to come back once you're behind
2010-11-13T11:56:33  <mega1> because we'd have to play both ways
2010-11-13T11:56:43  <antimatroid> yeah, that's true
2010-11-13T11:56:51  <antimatroid> terrible terrible idea
2010-11-13T11:58:09  <mega1> my bot would be fine with a few hundred planets
2010-11-13T11:58:09  <antimatroid> right, well i'm going to just make a clean full cut map genertor now
2010-11-13T11:58:12  <antimatroid> then i can remove anything after
2010-11-13T11:58:13  <lavalamp_> one possible way to do "non-symmetric":
2010-11-13T11:58:24  <mega1> let's increase the map count
2010-11-13T11:58:27  <antimatroid> really? i haven't tested
2010-11-13T11:58:31  <antimatroid> games of that size would look cool
2010-11-13T11:58:44  <mega1> just being sarcastic
2010-11-13T11:58:45  <antimatroid> i have some pretty nasty o(n^x) loops though
2010-11-13T11:59:01  <lavalamp_> generate a non-symmetric map. duplicate it and translate so that it would take 200 turns to get from one copy to the other. reverse player starting positions on the second copy.
2010-11-13T11:59:10  <Frontier> mega1: I bet your bot would manage to beat the others on any map *sigh*
2010-11-13T11:59:39  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: or just run two games and merge results
2010-11-13T11:59:39  <mega1> there are map types it doesn't like
2010-11-13T11:59:51  <lavalamp_> that way, even if one player wins each half, the one who did it more efficiently wins
2010-11-13T11:59:52  <mega1> like any other bot
2010-11-13T12:00:09  <mega1> but what type they like differs
2010-11-13T12:00:32  <lavalamp_> or you could put the halves only 100 moves away so there's some possibility of interacting late in the game
2010-11-13T12:00:32  <mega1> there is no way to change the map generator without favouring some
2010-11-13T12:00:37  <antimatroid> my new bot has only just started executing some moves tonight
2010-11-13T12:00:42  <antimatroid> i'm taking my time
2010-11-13T12:01:14  <antimatroid> the map generator was always meant to change
2010-11-13T12:01:17  <Frontier> antimatroid: I wish I was at that point. I have like 5 good ideas that cannot be merged to a concept ^^
2010-11-13T12:01:24  <antimatroid> you can't not change it without favouring some either
2010-11-13T12:01:49  <antimatroid> Frontier: i spent a couple of months playing around with ideas :)
2010-11-13T12:02:05  <antimatroid> i've thrown out most of my elaborate game theory ones
2010-11-13T12:02:07  <antimatroid> it was too messy
2010-11-13T12:04:36  <mega1> either way some are favoured. Why not favour those who actually invested effort?
2010-11-13T12:04:57  <Frontier> ok ok, but we need some clear statement now that there are only 2 weeks to go. :D
2010-11-13T12:05:23  <antimatroid> mega1: i invested effort into having a very general strategy
2010-11-13T12:05:40  <antimatroid> and i do happen to be on the side of what was always intended
2010-11-13T12:05:47  <antimatroid> but i will admit it wasn't posted very clearly
2010-11-13T12:06:07  <mega1> ok, I'm out of this. We are both broken records.
2010-11-13T12:06:16  <antimatroid> i would prefer maps to always be different at the end, i just wish people were told blunter
2010-11-13T12:06:28  <phreeza> hehe
2010-11-13T12:07:41  <Frontier> Right I wish I was told there will be massive changes to the map generator ^^. And we need an email notification of the change to all participants so everyone is informed at the same time.
2010-11-13T12:07:44  <antimatroid> imo the fuckup comes in that everybody wasn't clear on how it was going to work, rules are allowed to be general provided they're clear
2010-11-13T12:08:41  <lavalamp_> yeah, the mistake has already been made and the resolution is really unclear
2010-11-13T12:08:53  <Frontier> mega1: do you rely on things that weren't set in stone from the beginning? map radius, growth, anything?
2010-11-13T12:09:02  <antimatroid> he doesn't
2010-11-13T12:09:16  <lavalamp_> maybe best would be to make a decision and give us an extra couple weeks ^^
2010-11-13T12:09:19  <antimatroid> his argument comes with the late change
2010-11-13T12:09:35  <antimatroid> i have always expected it and don't see it as a change, neither of us is really wrong, hence the problem
2010-11-13T12:09:48  <mega1> Frontier: not to my knowledge, but please read what I and others wrote about optimizing for the current map generator in the forum
2010-11-13T12:10:12  <Frontier> and i second that. 2 weeks ago i told janzer or some other official that by now there should be no more changes to the game.
2010-11-13T12:10:18  <antimatroid> mega1: you have to understand the counterargument about not just optimizing on that generator
2010-11-13T12:10:31  <Frontier> mega1: in the strategy section?
2010-11-13T12:11:11  <antimatroid> yeah, you're right, there is no point us trying to discuss it
2010-11-13T12:12:07  <mega1> Frontier: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1087&start=50
2010-11-13T12:12:10  <mega1> six pages
2010-11-13T12:12:25  <antimatroid> lol, someone suggested extending deadline to january
2010-11-13T12:12:27  <antimatroid> i would actually die
2010-11-13T12:12:53  <phreeza> hahah i wouldn't mind a second round though
2010-11-13T12:12:54  <mega1> would make sense, but please don't
2010-11-13T12:13:00  <Frontier> I can't survive on coffee and pizza for so long Oo
2010-11-13T12:13:09  <phreeza> until the next game comes
2010-11-13T12:13:12  <Bobng> ai-contest.com is a pretty good domain
2010-11-13T12:13:15  <Bobng> how did you get it?
2010-11-13T12:13:19  <Bobng> it must have been squatted.
2010-11-13T12:13:56  <antimatroid> i'm not an organiser :P
2010-11-13T12:14:11  <flag> It has a dash, so it's probably not that big of a domain
2010-11-13T12:14:47  <antimatroid> i swear there wasn't this much issue with new maps for tron contest
2010-11-13T12:15:02  <antimatroid> and that was right towards the end
2010-11-13T12:15:08  <Frontier> wow, who suggested 100 planets? my 32-bit-int-bitmasks only can hold up to 31 planets
2010-11-13T12:15:27  <antimatroid> Frontier: i think you're safe, they aren't going to fuck people like you over, there's too many of you
2010-11-13T12:15:42  <antimatroid> but imo it was a poor choice
2010-11-13T12:15:49  <mega1> antimatroid: because for tron there was no map generator so we could not see a better way
2010-11-13T12:15:53  <Frontier> lol, that was what i was hoping for. i know i should feel ashamed.
2010-11-13T12:16:47  <mega1> so the _huge_ shuffling of ranks and rush at the end was accepted
2010-11-13T12:16:58  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4409), bix0r4ever(4208), Raschi(4172), _Astek_(4165), george(4109), Accoun(4086), shangas(4078), Error323(4077), dmj111(4077), asavis(4057)
2010-11-13T12:17:06  <antimatroid> there will be a huge shuffling of results with this if you even regenerate the maps
2010-11-13T12:17:09  <mega1> it doesn't mean that it didn't suck
2010-11-13T12:17:12  <antimatroid> the main server only has the first 100 still
2010-11-13T12:17:16  <Frontier> comment of glevee: "I see what you're saying is that I should have been using maps of New York city to test my Bot, since no where does it say that they won't be used..." made my day
2010-11-13T12:17:33  <janzert> antimatroid: where is your current generator at?
2010-11-13T12:17:39  <flag> The people who are doing well with the current maps will always reject the change and the people that are doing poorly will always want to mix something up
2010-11-13T12:17:50  <antimatroid> janzert: which one? :P
2010-11-13T12:17:52  <flag> You can't really agree
2010-11-13T12:18:04  <janzert> the latest one with the most features :)
2010-11-13T12:18:14  <antimatroid> can you wait 30 minutes?
2010-11-13T12:18:18  <antimatroid> it should really be cleaned
2010-11-13T12:18:19  <janzert> sure
2010-11-13T12:18:21  <mega1> flag: I thought you are in the first group?
2010-11-13T12:18:28  <antimatroid> are you going to put some maps up?
2010-11-13T12:18:37  <Frontier> Up to 31 planets and no more is fine for me, as are line symmetrical maps, as long as i can optimize for *some* kind of symmetry. I am biased, too.
2010-11-13T12:18:44  <flag> I'm in neither
2010-11-13T12:19:09  <janzert> ok, between the email and an IM he sent it's obvious that he is want to make the change
2010-11-13T12:19:11  <lavalamp_> I sympathize with both viewpoints too much
2010-11-13T12:19:27  <lavalamp_> janzert: is want?
2010-11-13T12:19:42  <janzert> wanting
2010-11-13T12:19:53  <lavalamp_> k
2010-11-13T12:20:03  <mega1> the only thing that's obivous from that email is that he wants to delegate it to someone else
2010-11-13T12:20:19  <lavalamp_> ...are you guys talking about the same email?
2010-11-13T12:20:25  <mega1> yes
2010-11-13T12:20:30  <lavalamp_> if you are I agree with mega1
2010-11-13T12:20:38  <flag> I'm in neither, but I don't think it's incredibly fair to change them at the last minute
2010-11-13T12:20:48  <janzert> in the interest of 'getting it done' if you're ok I'll do the specifics for now and we can change them if he says different or it horribly breaks things
2010-11-13T12:21:12  <mega1> if I may ask what was the voting for?
2010-11-13T12:21:13  <antimatroid> janzert: actually, it might take an hour, there were changes that needed making too
2010-11-13T12:21:14  <lavalamp_> basically one of the organizers needs to be the badguy and decide one way or the other
2010-11-13T12:21:34  <lavalamp_> half of the contestants will hate you but there's no way around that at this point...
2010-11-13T12:21:43  <antimatroid> mega1: he wanted to add the maps before even talking to people
2010-11-13T12:21:52  <antimatroid> amstan added the poll
2010-11-13T12:22:11  <antimatroid> and there does seem to be an equal split on opinions
2010-11-13T12:22:12  <janzert> ok, assume yes/use your suggestion for all the specific question right now
2010-11-13T12:22:13  <mega1> he was "slightly opposed" but wanted to add the maps, I see
2010-11-13T12:22:44  <antimatroid> that was janzert?
2010-11-13T12:22:52  <janzert> mega1: where is he slightly opposed? that's me
2010-11-13T12:23:39  <janzert> part of his message to me is "I support this change"
2010-11-13T12:23:40  <mega1> sorry, he = janzert in what I wrote

2010-11-13T12:25:37  <antimatroid> okay, well i'm working
2010-11-13T12:25:42  <antimatroid> log is base 2 in python yes?
2010-11-13T12:26:10  <antimatroid> and you agree with making the radius more likely to be further from the center?
2010-11-13T12:26:12  <janzert> natural log
2010-11-13T12:26:17  <lavalamp_> holy crap I think I finally have a bot that plays better with more iterations
2010-11-13T12:26:42  <janzert> use math.log(x, base=2) for log base 2
2010-11-13T12:26:44  <Frontier> just correct the start positions to be far enough from each other and everyone is happy.
2010-11-13T12:26:49  <mega1> lavalamp_: what's an iteration?
2010-11-13T12:27:22  <lavalamp_> mega1: I'm playing with monte carlo for selecting best move order
2010-11-13T12:27:34  <mega1> lavalamp_: cool
2010-11-13T12:27:47  <janzert> antimatroid: you mean making the planets even density throughout the map?
2010-11-13T12:27:55  <antimatroid> yeah that's the idea
2010-11-13T12:28:10  <antimatroid> migi32 pointed it out, and mcleopold came up with the log(r(0,1), 2)
2010-11-13T12:28:25  <janzert> yeah, that seems best
2010-11-13T12:28:48  <antimatroid> i'm going to make it so that players home planets are 1 and 2 again as well
2010-11-13T12:28:56  <antimatroid> people seemed to want that, and given it can happen i might as well
2010-11-13T12:29:09  <Frontier> so on every radius there is the same density but they can still be very close on the 'logitude'
2010-11-13T12:30:11  <janzert> I know it's probably easy to do but I wouldn't worry about that too much
2010-11-13T12:33:07  <Migi32> antimatroid, log2(r(0,1))? That gives a random number between -inf and 1. Are you sure this is right?
2010-11-13T12:33:17  <Migi32> -inf and 0 I mean
2010-11-13T12:33:37  <dmj111`> Why not just pick x, y like the old generator, and then convert to polar?  Or, if you want line symmetry, make it symmetric about the x axis all the time, then rotate the map by a random number of degrees?
2010-11-13T12:33:44  *** dmj111` is now known as dmj111

2010-11-13T12:35:44  <Migi32> yea, like this: do { x = rand(-max_r,max_r); y = rand(-max_r,max_r); r = sqrt(x*x+y*y); } while (r > max_r); theta = atan2(y,x);
2010-11-13T12:36:19  <Migi32> should give you the same result as generating it in polar coordinates, but now you are sure.

2010-11-13T12:40:32  <antimatroid> Mcleopold thought sqrt would put too many maps on the outside
2010-11-13T12:40:41  <Migi32> maybe it was log2(random(1,4))
2010-11-13T12:41:17  <antimatroid> that wasn't what he said, hmmm
2010-11-13T12:42:13  <McLeopold> howdy
2010-11-13T12:42:29  <Migi32> last year I had to integrate over circles and spheres all the time, it was also with a correction factor, lets see if I can remember this...
2010-11-13T12:43:45  <phreeza> jacobian determinant, something like that?
2010-11-13T12:43:51  <phreeza> been a few years for me :
2010-11-13T12:43:52  <Migi32> yea that :)
2010-11-13T12:43:54  <phreeza> :D
2010-11-13T12:44:32  <antimatroid> i'm not particularly keen to switch from generating polar coordinates and coverting
2010-11-13T12:44:38  <antimatroid> it's already written and works
2010-11-13T12:44:48  <antimatroid> i'm just fixing up the creation of central neutrals
2010-11-13T12:44:59  <antimatroid> it doesn't do extra ones for point symmetric maps atm
2010-11-13T12:45:38  <antimatroid> wait, i don't think you can ever can you?
2010-11-13T12:47:13  <antimatroid> nah yeah that's fine
2010-11-13T12:47:18  <McLeopold> you could do a density check before accepting new planets
2010-11-13T12:47:38  <antimatroid> nah, it's good to have a mix of densities
2010-11-13T12:47:47  <antimatroid> we just don't want it to be disproportionate
2010-11-13T12:48:49  <janzert> yeah, we don't care about the specific distribution of any specific map too much but do want it to average out over all the maps
2010-11-13T12:51:37  <Migi32> ok so the correction factor for integrating over the area of a circle in polar coordinates (r,theta) is just r
2010-11-13T12:52:07  <Migi32> this means it should be twice as likely to generate the coordinates (1,x) than (0.5,x)

2010-11-13T12:54:10  <Migi32> I'm actually fairly sure that for x=1/2 it gives overall equal density. But yea, maybe maps with x different from 1/2 can be interesting as well
2010-11-13T12:54:41  <Migi32> like a map with no central planet and most planets in a circle shape

2010-11-13T12:55:56  <burny> when you send units from planet to planet, do they all leave+land simultaneously? or is there a buffer like there is in the flash game?
2010-11-13T12:56:00  <Frontier> map1 has pretty much all planets on a cirle
2010-11-13T12:56:41  <Frontier> burny: they start at the start of the round and land at the end of the round
2010-11-13T12:56:51  <antimatroid> atm the maps are always going to have a center planet
2010-11-13T12:57:00  <antimatroid> although that doesn't mean much in line symmetric maps
2010-11-13T12:57:40  <Frontier> burny: so the planets grow while the ships are still in flight. when you are on tick away from a 0 ships 5 growth planet it will have 5 ships when you arrive
2010-11-13T12:58:14  <burny> ok, thanks
2010-11-13T12:59:35  <Frontier> burny: it becomes clearer if you imagine the game to play continuously without the turn steps. during a turn the ships fly a distance of '1' and the planets grow x ships
2010-11-13T13:01:34  <burny> ya, but in the flash game, if you send 500 ships in one turn, they get spaced out greatly
2010-11-13T13:02:23  <burny> that's all I was wondering about, was if it simulated that sort of delay/que
2010-11-13T13:05:07  <janzert> no we don't, a fleet is a single entity within the game
2010-11-13T13:05:17  <burny> yup: thanks
2010-11-13T13:07:45  <burny> if planets A B C are spaced out 2 each(4 between A C) if you fly a->b->c it takes 5turns rather than 4 right?
2010-11-13T13:09:47  <brx> burny: why would it take 5 turns rather than 4?
2010-11-13T13:10:17  <burny> cause the ships landing at B on second turn, can't be sent until the 3rd turn?
2010-11-13T13:11:37  <brx> "landing" doesn't take any time.
2010-11-13T13:12:09  <burny> so a distance one 1, means it lands at the end of that turn, and can be sent again the next turn?
2010-11-13T13:12:15  <yellowseed> burny: i'm not sure about this, but i think a turn is 1. land, 2. grow, 3. send fleets
2010-11-13T13:12:53  <burny> <Frontier> burny: so the planets grow while the ships are still in flight. when you are on tick away from a 0 ships 5 growth planet it will have 5 ships when you arrive
2010-11-13T13:13:04  <burny> sounds the opposite from what frontier said
2010-11-13T13:13:31  <antimatroid> janzert: http://codepad.org/eMMqZnET
2010-11-13T13:13:45  <burny> but I gues.. grow, send, land, move vs grow send move land
2010-11-13T13:13:51  <janzert> burny: http://ai-contest.com/specification.php#game-state-update might help clarify
2010-11-13T13:14:29  <janzert> antimatroid: thanks
2010-11-13T13:14:40  <antimatroid> it doesn't always generate the number of planets it randomly selected, but i'm pretty sure the range is 15 to 30 inclusive
2010-11-13T13:15:24  <antimatroid> it certainly doesn't go above 30, and i'm 99% sure 14 doesn't happen
2010-11-13T13:15:24  <burny> thanks jaz.. to me that sugests that a distance of 1, means the ships are available at the new planet, on the consecutive round
2010-11-13T13:15:30  <antimatroid> but that isn't really that important
2010-11-13T13:16:07  <antimatroid> should i make another forum post explicitly outlining what specifications the maps meet?
2010-11-13T13:16:24  <janzert> burny: yes that's correct
2010-11-13T13:16:29  <burny> anti: if some people are aware of it: then I would say so
2010-11-13T13:16:32  <flag> So the new maps are a go?
2010-11-13T13:16:39  <burny> otherwise some people have an unfair advantage

2010-11-13T13:17:42  <janzert> antimatroid: sure but add a disclaimer that there is still a small possibility of change in the specifics
2010-11-13T13:17:48  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-13T13:17:56  <burny> assuming no one is aware of specifications: I'd say it depends on the nature of how you want the AI to be working.. is part of the problem suposed to be determining size/shape/etc. or should symetry be part of the strategy, etc.
2010-11-13T13:18:55  <antimatroid> burny: the rules were specified for bots to be general, although it wasn't very clear

2010-11-13T13:19:32  <burny> for instance: rather than symetry, the maps could have been played twice(once from each side), and the 'winner' is the average score from each game
2010-11-13T13:20:06  <burny> then part of the AI would be not just winning vs losing: but lasting longer if you are losing, and winning faster if you have the upper hand, etc.
2010-11-13T13:20:23  <janzert> antimatroid: why line 156 isn't inside the if/else conditions directly above and not / 2 for the second case?

2010-11-13T13:28:14  <burny> anti.  if bots are not suposed to take advantage of symmetry, it would be hard to make it be generic
2010-11-13T13:28:45  <burny> and most likely, we would want the AI to assume each side starts with equal army size

2010-11-13T13:29:43  <Migi32> I don't like the idea of playing 2 times on asymmetric maps. It's like playing chess 2 times, and each time one of the players plays without his queen. As players/bots approach optimal play, the win percentages will come closer and closer to 100% for the favorite.
2010-11-13T13:30:02  <burny> migi: more like playing chess twice, once as white once as black
2010-11-13T13:30:30  <antimatroid> nobodies introducing asymetric maps
2010-11-13T13:31:28  <burny> and if non-symetric maps were used, I would sugest the winner to be based on like.. if I won in 58 rounds, and you won in 47rounds, that meant you win the match

2010-11-13T13:31:59  <burny> but as anti said: no one is introducing asymetric maps: I was just hypothesizing
2010-11-13T13:32:34  <burny> with regards to wether or not information about the maps should be given out
2010-11-13T13:34:10  <Migi32> ah, with a whole bunch of maps that would be cool (if you still play each of them twice to fully eliminate luck)
2010-11-13T13:34:48  <burny> it could be cool: but it would completely change the AI mechanics
2010-11-13T13:36:00  <Migi32> I wouldn't say completely. My bot doesn't rely on the fact that the maps are symmetrical. But I agree that probably some bots do.
2010-11-13T13:36:11  <burny> like: you would need to determine if you will win or lose, and if on the losing end, choose a path/pattern that makes the enemy take as long as possible to get you.. with symmetry, that's not remotly a viable strategy
2010-11-13T13:37:14  <burny> I imagine most bots, if in a losing situation. will fight to the death rather than run away hoping for the buzzer to save them
2010-11-13T13:37:20  <Migi32> ah ok you meant "rounds" as in number of turns. No, sorry, then I completely disagree. I thought you meant we both play 100 games on 50 maps, the winner is the one who won on most maps.
2010-11-13T13:37:30  <Migi32> completely infeasible to do, but cool :)
2010-11-13T13:37:30  <burny> or, rather than hoping the opponent will make a mistake

2010-11-13T13:38:28  <burny> I do that sort of thing in chess all the time(I'm good but not expereinced)
2010-11-13T13:39:04  <burny> if I'm losing, I don't just "make it hard to win".. I go suicidal hoping they make a mistake, due to the unorthodox play style
2010-11-13T13:40:02  <antimatroid> the specification page is going to need updating
2010-11-13T13:40:28  <Migi32> antimatroid, you removed 0-growths? Awww.
2010-11-13T13:40:37  <Migi32> 0-growths were interesting
2010-11-13T13:41:54  <Migi32> but otherwise it's looking good. Why is this rule there: "there can be anywhere from 0 to 4 additional planets starting at an equal distance from both players"?
2010-11-13T13:42:13  <antimatroid> Migi32: they were never there
2010-11-13T13:42:17  <antimatroid> only centre planet, i kept that
2010-11-13T13:42:41  <Migi32> only the center planet could have 0 growth and I never noticed that? Omg.
2010-11-13T13:42:53  <antimatroid> Migi32: because centre planets add more spice to games
2010-11-13T13:43:07  <antimatroid> particularly with the line symmetric maps
2010-11-13T13:43:16  <Migi32> yes but why only 4?
2010-11-13T13:43:31  <antimatroid> it seemed like a reasonable number
2010-11-13T13:43:36  <antimatroid> thats a max of 5
2010-11-13T13:43:48  <Frontier> how much do you plan to increase the planet number? ^^
2010-11-13T13:43:56  <antimatroid> planets numbers are between 15 and 30
2010-11-13T13:44:44  * Frontier quickly edits source code to const int MAX_PLANET_COUNT = 30;
2010-11-13T13:45:17  <Migi32> you really need to specify what "additional" means here. After the normal generation of 15-30 maps? After the center planet has been placed?
2010-11-13T13:46:15  <antimatroid> Migi32: what?
2010-11-13T13:46:42  <Migi32> 0 to 4 "additional" planets. Additional compared to what?
2010-11-13T13:47:10  <antimatroid> fixed?
2010-11-13T13:47:49  <Migi32> additional, adjective. Added, extra, or supplementary to what is already present or available. Which planets are already present here?
2010-11-13T13:48:11  <Migi32> the center planet?
2010-11-13T13:48:24  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-13T13:48:48  <Migi32> I think you should rewrite it then as "anywhere from 0 to 5 planets starting at an equal distance"
2010-11-13T13:49:15  <antimatroid> hmm, but only the center one can have growth between 0 and 5
2010-11-13T13:49:22  <antimatroid> and it is the dead centre of the symmetries
2010-11-13T13:49:58  <Migi32> ok, fair point.
2010-11-13T13:50:07  <antimatroid> can i remove that edit?
2010-11-13T13:50:29  <Migi32> yea, that is said on rule 1
2010-11-13T13:50:46  <antimatroid> yeah, i misunderstood you at first
2010-11-13T13:52:26  <Migi32> no it was my mistake, I read the whole sentence wrong. I thought "There is always one center neutral" was a separate sentence.
2010-11-13T13:55:06  <antimatroid> i would laugh if i now sucked at my new maps
2010-11-13T13:55:23  <antimatroid> i'm in the middle of rewriting it cleanly and haven't been able to even test on them with a proper bot

2010-11-13T14:08:37  <Frontier> you cannot have one code cover maps up to 23 planets and maps up to 200 planets at once for example.  - well, maybe mega1 can ^^. even if there were no rules, some assumptions had to be made

2010-11-13T14:13:11  <Frontier> Maybe add a link to new 'sample maps' in the email. Not everyone has python, but there is a need for some local test maps.
2010-11-13T14:15:03  <Mjothvitnir> yeah, I hope civ4 will run the map generator, so I don't have to install python
2010-11-13T14:15:12  <mega1> is it going to be te final map generator?
2010-11-13T14:15:24  <mega1> or you are going to tune it to keep things interesting?
2010-11-13T14:15:28  <antimatroid> mega1: it looks like it
2010-11-13T14:15:41  <antimatroid> i expect some refinements will be allowed if necessary
2010-11-13T14:15:51  <mega1> no mix of old and new maps then?
2010-11-13T14:16:04  <antimatroid> it does point symmetric maps too
2010-11-13T14:16:07  <Migi32> old maps are technically still allowed
2010-11-13T14:16:21  <Migi32> and the rules don't say that the generator can't change
2010-11-13T14:16:21  <antimatroid> they're a subset of what the new generator will make
2010-11-13T14:16:30  <mega1> please

2010-11-13T14:18:17  <mega1> yes, finally

2010-11-13T14:22:31  <antimatroid> does that mean 14 can happen?
2010-11-13T14:22:52  <janzert> yes if my logic is correct above
2010-11-13T14:23:00  <Mjothvitnir> My mistake Civ4 has python dll, it is Open Office that has python exe...
2010-11-13T14:23:02  <antimatroid> just change the minPlanets variable to 16
2010-11-13T14:23:04  <janzert> in which case I'll just make it bump up to 16 instead
2010-11-13T14:23:15  <antimatroid> yeah sorry, i did say that might be the case ;)
2010-11-13T14:23:20  <janzert> just wanted someone to double check my logic :)
2010-11-13T14:23:37  <Mjothvitnir> so are you saying that it won't be symmetric
2010-11-13T14:24:27  <antimatroid> no
2010-11-13T14:24:43  <Migi32> it's confirmed, it was sqrt(random(0,1)) :)
2010-11-13T14:24:49  <antimatroid> the map generator picks a number between 15 and 30 for planets to generate, it may not actually generate that
2010-11-13T14:24:49  <Migi32> my intuition was correct :)
2010-11-13T14:24:52  <janzert> here's where I'm at right now
2010-11-13T14:24:55  <janzert> http://codepad.org/eytoZCJy
2010-11-13T14:24:57  <Mjothvitnir> how is centerplanet + odd number of planets symmetric?
2010-11-13T14:25:23  <Mjothvitnir> or am I just misunderstanding what you were saying?
2010-11-13T14:26:03  <antimatroid> janzert: what am i looking for?
2010-11-13T14:26:34  <Migi32> how can it generate an even number of planets by these rules?
2010-11-13T14:26:48  <Migi32> ah, ok in line symmetry, I see
2010-11-13T14:27:20  <janzert> antimatroid: nothing in particular, I've basically just made minor formatting changes is all
2010-11-13T14:27:56  <antimatroid> oh sure, i'd never done anything in python before, rip it to pieces if you want ;)
2010-11-13T14:30:02  <antimatroid> janzert: is it safe to safe turn limit wont change from 200?
2010-11-13T14:30:51  <janzert> I would have said it was safe to say the current map_generator will be used a week ago
2010-11-13T14:31:06  <burny> how do you know how many turns are remaining?
2010-11-13T14:31:12  <antimatroid> i had always expected maps to change :\
2010-11-13T14:31:13  <burny> can make a global variable and count it yourself?
2010-11-13T14:31:28  <antimatroid> burny: yes you can
2010-11-13T14:31:34  <Migi32> yes burny that's the only way
2010-11-13T14:31:40  <burny> k
2010-11-13T14:31:58  <Migi32> well, doesn't have to be global, but just, a variable tracking it throughout the game
2010-11-13T14:32:17  <burny> k, and how do we initialize? put it inside main?
2010-11-13T14:32:25  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-13T14:33:25  <burny> k, didn't know you can have more than 1 main in a single app
2010-11-13T14:33:44  <antimatroid> there isn't?
2010-11-13T14:34:19  <burny> the main doesn't ever return, so how does the other bot get to go?
2010-11-13T14:34:23  <burny> oh, is it networked?
2010-11-13T14:36:25  <antimatroid> my main function looks like this these days
2010-11-13T14:36:26  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/1a2mZxUU
2010-11-13T14:37:15  <burny> I just would have thought the final game, would have an alternate main, and it just calls 'DoTurn'
2010-11-13T14:37:42  <antimatroid> no, your bot is playing the whole game
2010-11-13T14:37:49  <antimatroid> not a bunch of semi repeated ones
2010-11-13T14:38:04  <burny> k
2010-11-13T14:40:03  <antimatroid> anyway, it's 6 40am, i should go to bed
2010-11-13T14:40:42  <lavalamp_> can you post your latest generator first?
2010-11-13T14:40:57  <antimatroid> it's linked in the forum
2010-11-13T14:41:34  <lavalamp_> ok great go sleep ^^
2010-11-13T14:42:01  <antimatroid> when i say i'm going to bed, it'll take a good 30 minutes yet :)
2010-11-13T14:42:14  <antimatroid> i'm shocking at actually getting up and doing the deed
2010-11-13T14:43:07  <antimatroid> i can get back to working on my bot when i wake up now that the map thing is pretty much sorted
2010-11-13T14:43:32  <Mjothvitnir> which code to use?  anti or janz?
2010-11-13T14:44:47  <antimatroid> they should do exactly the same
2010-11-13T14:44:53  <antimatroid> janzerts is closest to what will be used
2010-11-13T14:45:40  <janzert> yeah, still making a few minor changes to assure number of planets range is always met
2010-11-13T14:47:59  <antimatroid> what other problems were there?
2010-11-13T14:48:15  <janzert> actually my logic before was wrong
2010-11-13T14:48:27  <antimatroid> oh yeah
2010-11-13T14:48:30  <janzert> symmetry 1 can only produce odd planets
2010-11-13T14:48:58  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-13T14:49:30  <antimatroid> well it could do even, but not with the centre planet
2010-11-13T14:49:38  <janzert> but you have to assure that going into the final generation there are an even number of planets left to generate
2010-11-13T14:49:50  <antimatroid> ah yeah
2010-11-13T14:50:12  <antimatroid> wait, wouldn't the /2 handle that?
2010-11-13T14:51:04  <Mjothvitnir> so with radial we have center + even (sym) planets, with bilat we have center + 0-X on line planets + even (sym) planets, yes?
2010-11-13T14:51:36  <antimatroid> aahhh what? :P
2010-11-13T14:51:42  <antimatroid> i did the generator using polar coordinates
2010-11-13T14:51:57  <antimatroid> then converted those for saving maps
2010-11-13T14:52:58  <antimatroid> each player has a rotation angle theta1 and theta2, for a new point, pick r and theta, then radial symmetry -> theta1+theta and theta2+theta, bilat -> theta1+theta and theta2-theta
2010-11-13T14:53:05  <antimatroid> wrapping around 360 degrees
2010-11-13T14:54:25  <janzert> symmtryType == 1 is radial right?
2010-11-13T14:54:48  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-13T14:54:57  <Mjothvitnir> the difference I was asking about was that bilat can have an even number of total planets because there are an odd number of on "the mirror" line planets to off set the center planet
2010-11-13T14:55:18  <Mjothvitnir> (offset in terms of count)
2010-11-13T14:55:33  <antimatroid> maps can have up to 5 "central" neutrals
2010-11-13T14:55:54  <antimatroid> although it has to be an odd number for radially symmetric maps
2010-11-13T14:56:59  <lavalamp_> antimatroid: not if you left out the center planet
2010-11-13T14:57:29  <antimatroid> the centre planet is always added
2010-11-13T14:57:36  <antimatroid> that way players planets are 1 and 2
2010-11-13T14:57:47  <antimatroid> people wanted that for some reason, so i gave it to them by always adding centre planet
2010-11-13T14:58:31  *** wh1teside <wh1teside!~admin@adsl-76-202-215-207.dsl.emhril.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-11-13T14:58:46  <Mjothvitnir> so with both types of maps there is the possiblility of more than 1 (1-5) (1 since there is always a "center" planet) non-symmetrically-paired planets. (planets on the "mirror line" as it were)
2010-11-13T14:59:04  <janzert> http://codepad.org/8JSzFQRA
2010-11-13T14:59:24  <janzert> unless someone sees a problem with that, that is what I'll use
2010-11-13T15:01:27  <Frontier> btw, why is the center not at 0,0? I figure that would protect the maps from rounding errors that could make maps asymmetrical.
2010-11-13T15:01:53  <antimatroid> Frontier: people wanted positive coordinates
2010-11-13T15:02:13  <janzert> my understanding is the visualizer also requires it
2010-11-13T15:02:33  <antimatroid> janzert: you didn't copy the last part? but looks good to me
2010-11-13T15:02:53  <janzert> ?
2010-11-13T15:03:00  <antimatroid> wait, page didn't load, nm
2010-11-13T15:04:46  <antimatroid> i generated a few, they still look symmetric
2010-11-13T15:04:54  <antimatroid> so i assume nothing got messed up
2010-11-13T15:04:59  <Mjothvitnir> ok, I stumbled my way through the python (don't know python) and I see the answer to my questions, so you can ignore them. wait you already did.
2010-11-13T15:05:22  <antimatroid> :P sorry, i'm trying to read the code for janzert
2010-11-13T15:06:17  <janzert> I think the only real change I should have made is assuring the number of planets falls within the correct range
2010-11-13T15:06:57  <antimatroid> yeah, i thought i'd make a couple anyway
2010-11-13T15:07:19  <Zannick> looks fine to me modulo some style things
2010-11-13T15:07:32  <antimatroid> when i first put in multiple centre planets i didn't do it in pairs for radially symmetric maps, and 100 maps got posted with some not even symmetric
2010-11-13T15:07:39  <antimatroid> but that was quickly fixed
2010-11-13T15:07:54  <antimatroid> Zannick: i'd never used python, style was the last thing one thought of
2010-11-13T15:08:27  <Zannick> no worries
2010-11-13T15:08:54  <janzert> anyone have a preference on naming scheme for the new maps?
2010-11-13T15:09:12  <janzert> newmap<N>.txt?
2010-11-13T15:09:46  <janzert> or map_newstyle<N>.txt
2010-11-13T15:10:07  <Mjothvitnir> if you have to have "new" then "newmap" is better
2010-11-13T15:10:54  <Zannick> yeah, but if you make a next iteration, would you call it newnewmap?
2010-11-13T15:10:57  <antimatroid> yeah, newmap<n> is fine
2010-11-13T15:11:53  <janzert> Zannick: yeah, I'm just not creative enough to think of something else :)
2010-11-13T15:11:58  <Mjothvitnir> personally, I will call them "map#.txt" and put them in "newMap" directory.

2010-11-13T15:20:21  <janzert> a comment is required :P
2010-11-13T15:20:33  <Zannick> well, you could change centerneutrals to randint(0,3) and the mod to 4
2010-11-13T15:20:46  <Zannick> or you could just drop the mod
2010-11-13T15:21:06  <Zannick> or randint(0,5) and mod 6
2010-11-13T15:21:32  * Zannick shrug
2010-11-13T15:21:36  <janzert> actually I should probably make that 4 a constant set at the beginning of the file
2010-11-13T15:21:43  <janzert> and use while

2010-11-13T15:25:01  <Zannick> or += (noCenterNeutrals == 0) and 1 or -1
2010-11-13T15:25:47  <janzert> that gives a bias towards have 1 NoCenterNeutrals instead of an uniform distribution
2010-11-13T15:26:02  <Zannick> same as using a while loop
2010-11-13T15:26:03  <Mjothvitnir> good point
2010-11-13T15:26:44  <Zannick> since you need to switch from even to odd, but there are 3 even numbers mod 5 and 2 odd numbers
2010-11-13T15:27:10  <Zannick> that's why i recommend using (0,3) and mod 4 or (0,5) and mod 6 if you want a more even distribution through that

2010-11-13T15:56:58  <janzert> I'll post that in the forum shortly
2010-11-13T16:05:04  <Mjothvitnir> so how many central neutrals do you expect the code to produce on purpose (we'll ignore the ones it can create randomly as normal planets)
2010-11-13T16:05:31  <janzert> 1 in the very center and 0-5 along the central line.
2010-11-13T16:07:39  <Mjothvitnir> what does this line produce: (0,2,4,6;1,3,5) or??:  noCenterNeutrals = random.randrange(minCentral, maxCentral+1, 2)
2010-11-13T16:08:22  <Mjothvitnir> random.randrange(0,5+1,2)
2010-11-13T16:08:48  <janzert> http://docs.python.org/library/random.html#random.randrange
2010-11-13T16:09:15  <janzert> the stop will never be generated
2010-11-13T16:09:42  <Mjothvitnir> ok
2010-11-13T16:10:21  <janzert> so 0,2,4 or 1,3,5

2010-11-13T16:19:00  <Frontier> When I learnt English we were presented with the new way to spell "Hello!": "Hallo!" I have never seen it written like this since.
2010-11-13T16:20:41  <Frontier> Lol, when my sister was asked "What is the simple present?" she was half asleep and ansered in German something like "A simple gift." The teacher though she was mobbing him. He was kinda paranoid anyway.
2010-11-13T16:21:11  <Mjothvitnir> hmm, the only "hallo" I know is german
2010-11-13T16:23:30  <Frontier> We had a british student there and he was *allowed* to use hello instead of hallo. the rest of the class had to learn it the other way. anyway the internet was the best teacher so far ^^

2010-11-13T16:56:23  <janzert> I believe it was a square with sides of length 24
2010-11-13T16:56:31  <janzert> now it is a circle with radius 24
2010-11-13T16:56:40  <janzert> err, diameter 24
2010-11-13T16:57:01  <Mjothvitnir> so you just chopped off the corners, so to speak.
2010-11-13T16:57:29  <janzert> yes, if you is the collective you :)
2010-11-13T16:57:30  <mega1> and tuning just starts over
2010-11-13T16:57:45  <janzert> I'm just looking at the old and new generators
2010-11-13T16:58:22  <Mjothvitnir> true, antimatroid wrote it
2010-11-13T16:58:32  <Mjothvitnir> i believe
2010-11-13T16:58:33  <janzert> it's a little confusing because the old generator also called it's variable a radius
2010-11-13T16:58:43  <janzert> but from a quick glance that doesn't seem true
2010-11-13T16:58:51  <Mjothvitnir> the square bounds the circle
2010-11-13T16:59:07  <janzert> yes
2010-11-13T16:59:36  <janzert> and it would have planets outside of the max radius defined
2010-11-13T16:59:58  <Mjothvitnir> outside the square or outside the circle
2010-11-13T17:00:24  <janzert> outside the circle, that's what a radius defines right?
2010-11-13T17:01:02  <Mjothvitnir> yes. radius is a silly name for the length of a side of a square that bounds a circle
2010-11-13T17:01:02  <janzert> strictly I think of the radius of a square as rather nonsensical
2010-11-13T17:02:09  <janzert> ok, taking a short break and then I'll start generating and getting the new maps loaded
2010-11-13T17:02:37  <janzert> I'm planning on only generating 30 initially to see how this will work for the final contest as well
2010-11-13T17:02:54  <janzert> the current maps will still be there but will be disabled
2010-11-13T17:02:56  <Mjothvitnir> so all server fights will be on 30 maps?

2010-11-13T18:27:36  <mega1> being recursive too
2010-11-13T18:27:37  <McLeopold> flag: yes, it is a problem with the getgame.c code.  When it reads the pgn file, it crashes.
2010-11-13T18:28:01  <McLeopold> Frontier: and a recursive conversation at that.
2010-11-13T18:28:58  <McLeopold> So, my thought is I'm building the pgn file wrong.
2010-11-13T18:29:15  <Frontier> but what about the symbolic link issue?
2010-11-13T18:29:25  <McLeopold> Is that my issue?
2010-11-13T18:29:29  <Frontier> YES

2010-11-13T18:32:46  <Frontier> itermission - Linux users, use alsaequal if you need an equalizer that sits directly on top of alsa. It really helps with crappy laptop speakers.

2010-11-13T18:33:59  <Frontier> thx McLeopold

2010-11-13T18:43:28  <mega1> pairing bots with slightly lower ranked ones after resubmission would help against gaming the leaderboard
2010-11-13T18:43:37  <Frontier> the visualizer needs to be adapted, this game is really ugly: http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas?game_id=1289690094|McLeopold.AntBot.py|lavalamp.pwwax.12

2010-11-13T19:07:20  <McLeopold> Time to write a asymmetrical map generator. :)
2010-11-13T19:07:23  <virdo> for purposes of visualizer, that game you've pasted here has 3 planets on top of each other (impossible to see troops hiding behind the planet)
2010-11-13T19:07:24  <Mjothvitnir> slightly, since 23 was the old number

2010-11-13T19:21:40  <Zannick> ew, the map is shifted a little too much to the right
2010-11-13T19:22:11  <Zannick> yeah, the new maps are a little off center in the visualizer
2010-11-13T19:22:50  <janzert> I noticed that too
2010-11-13T19:22:55  <McLeopold> thx, there running on my server now
2010-11-13T19:23:17  <janzert> I think the old visualizer always put the min(x) and min(y) at 0

2010-11-13T19:42:56  <Mjothvitnir> um, there were already equidistant  planets (planet zero + any on the line perpendicular to the line between planets 1&2)
2010-11-13T19:43:10  <Mjothvitnir> goingthrough zero
2010-11-13T19:43:14  <lavalamp_> Yeah, well I dealt with one just fine ^^
2010-11-13T19:43:33  <lavalamp_> but that's in relation to my new code, not the new maps...
2010-11-13T19:44:14  <Mjothvitnir> new code? you starting from scratch
2010-11-13T19:44:33  <Mjothvitnir> actually, now would be a good time if one was planning to do that

2010-11-13T19:53:59  <janzert> the maps are offset because the new generator does translatest the planets by radius + 2 instead of radius
2010-11-13T19:54:27  <janzert> s/does translatest/translates
2010-11-13T19:57:22  <McLeopold> the visualizer should just look for max x and y

2010-11-13T20:05:53  <_xvinyl> hi everyone
2010-11-13T20:06:09  <_xvinyl> i've been away from this contest for quite some time now
2010-11-13T20:06:23  <_xvinyl> so what's the general state of things ?
2010-11-13T20:07:25  <lavalamp_> bocsimacko is kicking everyone's collective ass
2010-11-13T20:07:52  <_xvinyl> saw that :)
2010-11-13T20:08:12  <_xvinyl> doesn't he play on dhartme's server ?
2010-11-13T20:08:32  <_xvinyl> also, the forums looks horribly outdated with respect to TCP servers
2010-11-13T20:08:35  <burny> is there a sort of high end limit to the elo score?
2010-11-13T20:09:20  <lavalamp_> burny, depends on how many players there are and the strength distribution
2010-11-13T20:09:32  <burny> like, if a bot wins 100% of games.. would it be caped at like 200ish above the second highest?
2010-11-13T20:10:12  <lavalamp_> burny, I don't think there's a cap built in, but the math probably works out such that you can only be so much higher than everyone else
2010-11-13T20:10:47  <burny> the online visualizer doesn't seem to work for me, need a certain browser?
2010-11-13T20:13:17  <janzert> shouldn't although IE is stuck using the java visualizer which isn't nearly as nice
2010-11-13T20:13:44  <_xvinyl> burny: very slow in Firefox but ok in Chrome
2010-11-13T20:13:56  <_xvinyl> burny: not tried Opera for a long time though
2010-11-13T20:14:01  <burny> I'm using IE
2010-11-13T20:15:33  <janzert> hmm, it's working here with IE8
2010-11-13T20:15:46  <janzert> you do have to accept a java security warning though
2010-11-13T20:16:12  <janzert> and it's no where near as nice as the js visualizer other browsers get
2010-11-13T20:16:26  <janzert> so I would recommend using a different one

2010-11-13T20:19:18  <_xvinyl> mmh so are there trends in the strategies people use now ?
2010-11-13T20:19:48  <_xvinyl> like Minimax used to appear after some time during the Tron contest ?
2010-11-13T20:20:14  <burny> think the trend is they are getting better
2010-11-13T20:21:00  <_xvinyl> yea I guess so...
2010-11-13T20:21:24  <_xvinyl> just wondering if I can do something decent if I restart now

2010-11-13T20:28:38  <burny> unintialized variable?
2010-11-13T20:29:12  <_xvinyl> McLeopold: well, nothing in particular but I'd hate to discover someone already implemented a game engine in Haskell after havong wrote it
2010-11-13T20:29:14  <lavalamp_> no no... as in my bot resolved something differently than the server
2010-11-13T20:29:30  <McLeopold> talk to jmcarthur
2010-11-13T20:29:34  <jmcarthur> ?

2010-11-13T20:29:49  <_xvinyl> :P
2010-11-13T20:29:57  <jmcarthur> is somebody working on a haskell game engine?
2010-11-13T20:30:08  <McLeopold> you are
2010-11-13T20:30:23  <jmcarthur> err, well, umm, not publicly :)
2010-11-13T20:30:32  <_xvinyl> heh
2010-11-13T20:31:05  <jmcarthur> do you mean for planet wars i guess?
2010-11-13T20:31:13  <jmcarthur> that is not what i meant
2010-11-13T20:31:38  <jmcarthur> there were a couple people thinking about doing it, but i don't think they ever did
2010-11-13T20:32:06  <_xvinyl> jmcarthur: ok thanks for the update
2010-11-13T20:32:17  <burny> is there any rule about what the growth rate will be on your starting planet?
2010-11-13T20:32:22  <jmcarthur> mightybyte, Mathnerd314, and somebody else i think all independently considered it, iirc, but i could be mixing some people up
2010-11-13T20:33:06  <McLeopold> lavalamp_: something is really wrong with my server
2010-11-13T20:33:16  <jmcarthur> _xvinyl: for my bot i did have basically an entire rewrite of the engine in haskell, but it wouldn't generalize to other bots very well, let alone to a standalone engine
2010-11-13T20:33:19  <McLeopold> look at my games against zoorage
2010-11-13T20:34:27  <_xvinyl> jmcarthur: do you still compete ?
2010-11-13T20:34:42  <_xvinyl> jmcarthur: can't see your bot on the official server
2010-11-13T20:34:48  <lavalamp_> McLeopold: yes, it assigned a planet I took to player 3
2010-11-13T20:34:49  <jmcarthur> i've dropped out

2010-11-13T21:35:46  <antimatroid> i'm curious what people would want next time?
2010-11-13T21:36:08  <antimatroid> i really like the very general rules that were handed out about maps for tron and this, i do wish more people realised it was like that though
2010-11-13T21:38:27  <Mjothvitnir> where is the limit if no guildline was given?
2010-11-13T21:39:35  <Mjothvitnir> I think alot of people assumed that the example maps were mostly like the final maps and you seem to be saying that they should have assume completely nothing
2010-11-13T21:40:18  <antimatroid> Mjothvitnir: my understanding is built from competing in tron and seeing what the original organised interpretations are of their own rules on numerous ocassions
2010-11-13T21:40:37  <antimatroid> i have no problem with very general rules, provided they are clear, which i will admit they aren't
2010-11-13T21:41:03  <antimatroid> upper bounds should be given on sizes of maps, but I do like having very general rules on what the maps will look like at the end
2010-11-13T21:41:05  <krokkrok> There is no problem with the rules; what happened is what I expected to happen.
2010-11-13T21:41:07  <Mjothvitnir> ah, see then you have everyone else at a disadvantage. You knew that there was no organization in the Organization ;)
2010-11-13T21:41:13  <antimatroid> so people are writing a bot to play the game, not do well on specific types of maps

2010-11-13T21:42:35  <krokkrok> my concern is how the final tournament is going to be run.  Just using the regular ELO algorithm is not very good.

2010-11-13T21:43:14  <Mjothvitnir> I agree, I have been concerned with that since the begining, I expected that the maps would change some (but before now)
2010-11-13T21:44:10  <antimatroid> krokkrok: the regular elo algorithm works very well compared to any other alternative i've known of
2010-11-13T21:44:24  <krokkrok> well, how about, getting the right answer?
2010-11-13T21:44:32  <antimatroid> there is no right answer
2010-11-13T21:44:36  <krokkrok> yes, there is
2010-11-13T21:44:38  <antimatroid> some maps would result in a cyclic ordering
2010-11-13T21:44:46  <antimatroid> for some bots
2010-11-13T21:44:49  <krokkrok> nope
2010-11-13T21:44:52  <krokkrok> because
2010-11-13T21:45:05  <krokkrok> you are thinking about ordering wrong, the way ELO does it
2010-11-13T21:45:07  <krokkrok> which is wrong
2010-11-13T21:45:34  <krokkrok> ELO is assuming a>b>c is transitive, and so, it does all sorts of goofy stuff like running bots near each other to fine to the rank
2010-11-13T21:46:20  <krokkrok> if all combinations of games were run, the winner would be the one with the highest win/loss ratio
2010-11-13T21:46:34  <antimatroid> you have n bots b1, ..., bn that you want to define a strict preference relation < on, it's not possible to do that without doing it for a given set of maps and a huge round robbin, which is an absurdly inefficient use of resources
2010-11-13T21:47:03  <krokkrok> you said"there is no right answer"
2010-11-13T21:47:06  <Mjothvitnir> but anything else is pure luck
2010-11-13T21:47:12  <krokkrok> but there is, and we should tryto be as close to it as possible
2010-11-13T21:47:16  <antimatroid> round robbin isn't right, it's too inefficient
2010-11-13T21:47:38  <antimatroid> the current system is meant to be a best approximation to something like that as far as i know
2010-11-13T21:47:40  <krokkrok> what is right is, all bots play all bots, and count  the wins
2010-11-13T21:47:43  <antimatroid> i'm not an official
2010-11-13T21:47:55  <antimatroid> krokkrok: that was done for tron with random pairings
2010-11-13T21:47:56  <krokkrok> well, the ELO doesn't come close to getting the 'right answer'
2010-11-13T21:47:58  <antimatroid> it worked very poorly
2010-11-13T21:48:13  <antimatroid> it did better than this for ensuring bots got games against bots of a similar rank
2010-11-13T21:48:20  <krokkrok> when running all bots against all bots, there is no random.....
2010-11-13T21:48:35  <antimatroid> you can't run bots against all other bots, it's too inefficient
2010-11-13T21:48:50  <antimatroid> there is no point running the top 10 bots agains the botoom 3000 on every map
2010-11-13T21:48:53  <antimatroid> it's a huge waste of time
2010-11-13T21:48:57  <krokkrok> no its not
2010-11-13T21:49:11  <antimatroid> it is, you end up with top bots playing each other a couple of times
2010-11-13T21:49:14  <krokkrok> because, you dont actually know the top ten bots, without having the answer a priori
2010-11-13T21:49:15  <antimatroid> that isn't sufficient to rank them
2010-11-13T21:49:50  <antimatroid> http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/rankings.php
2010-11-13T21:50:00  <krokkrok> right now, rage bot can beat many of the top bot sometimes.  however, you dont see that in the ELO because they never face it, because they outrank it too much
2010-11-13T21:50:06  <antimatroid> please take a look at some of those users pages at the top, too many of the games were against shit bots
2010-11-13T21:50:21  <krokkrok> for testing, ELO is fine
2010-11-13T21:50:25  <krokkrok> for judgeing, its not
2010-11-13T21:50:50  <flag> The best bot is winning isn't it?
2010-11-13T21:50:53  <antimatroid> i was one of the people almost demanding a round robin last time, but look at the number of games top bots played against other top ranked bots last time, it sucked
2010-11-13T21:50:58  <janzert> yes it is, but you're obviously unwilling to be convinced
2010-11-13T21:51:37  <krokkrok> each bot plays every bot other bot the same number of times.  this is the correct answer.

2010-11-13T21:52:05  <flag> The top two bots might play each other only a few times then and the winner will just end up being a coinflip
2010-11-13T21:52:06  <antimatroid> krokkrok: i've be surprised if you even played everyone once
2010-11-13T21:52:19  <antimatroid> there's over 4000 bots
2010-11-13T21:52:29  <flag> Your method is fair, but only once you've played a million games
2010-11-13T21:52:35  <krokkrok> right, but, the goal is to get the best answer
2010-11-13T21:52:38  <Mjothvitnir> bots that don't work should be chucked
2010-11-13T21:52:38  <antimatroid> which is impossible
2010-11-13T21:52:59  <janzert> yes the best answer with the resources available is certainly not obtained by round robin
2010-11-13T21:53:04  <antimatroid> i would be in favour of a top x round robbin on c maps at the end
2010-11-13T21:53:14  <krokkrok> well, here is what is possible: use ELO to get an guess (ONLY A GUESS) at the top 100 or 200, then run all bots in the final round
2010-11-13T21:53:50  <janzert> round robin is about as inefficient as you can get no matter what
2010-11-13T21:54:02  <janzert> well using a reasonable system at least
2010-11-13T21:54:06  <krokkrok> no, its not reasonable
2010-11-13T21:54:12  <krokkrok> its math is unsound
2010-11-13T21:54:21  <antimatroid> so is the math for round robin :P
2010-11-13T21:54:28  <antimatroid> there is no perfect solution, like i originally said
2010-11-13T21:54:29  <krokkrok> efficienct but wrong, this is bad practice
2010-11-13T21:54:38  <krokkrok> yes there is a perfect solution
2010-11-13T21:54:51  <Mjothvitnir> we seem to have to competeing principles. "correct answer" and "good enough answer given resources"
2010-11-13T21:54:51  <antimatroid> look at how rankings are done for sporting events, the rankings for this are a million times better
2010-11-13T21:54:53  <krokkrok> all bots vs all bots, win/loss ratio
2010-11-13T21:55:04  <antimatroid> ranking is not an easy thing to do right, particularly with 4000 competitors
2010-11-13T21:55:04  <janzert> efficiency as defined by number of games required to come up with the correct answer
2010-11-13T21:55:06  <krokkrok> sporting events are corrupt
2010-11-13T21:55:13  <krokkrok> who CARES its a computer
2010-11-13T21:55:22  <krokkrok> run ten thousand games
2010-11-13T21:55:25  <antimatroid> nothing gives a correct answer in a time fram that is "correct"
2010-11-13T21:55:36  <krokkrok> why..not
2010-11-13T21:55:48  <antimatroid> krokkrok: it would take too long
2010-11-13T21:56:12  <krokkrok> how long would it take to run the top 100 bots against each other top 100 bot
2010-11-13T21:56:19  <antimatroid> if you player 4000 bots 1000 times, that's 1000*2000 games or something
2010-11-13T21:56:48  <antimatroid> depends on how long players are taking, an upper bound would be 50*200*1second
2010-11-13T21:56:50  <krokkrok> i already agreed, you can prune off the bottom by using ELO, and assume ELO
2010-11-13T21:56:52  <antimatroid> for one round
2010-11-13T21:57:07  <antimatroid> krokkrok: while i don't care about that, i think lower users that put time in wont
2010-11-13T21:57:28  <antimatroid> i'm still hoping to make top 10
2010-11-13T21:57:48  <krokkrok> its easy to make top ten.  just resubmit everytime you lose, you will get top ten eventually
2010-11-13T21:57:56  <antimatroid> no, at the end of the contest
2010-11-13T21:58:00  <krokkrok> ...
2010-11-13T21:58:11  <antimatroid> i don't even have a bot uploaded atm, i don't care for current rankings, its on the original 100 maps
2010-11-13T21:58:41  <Zannick> we should fix either the maps or the visualizer to better center the map
2010-11-13T21:59:27  <antimatroid> the visualiser needs to enforece it renders square
2010-11-13T21:59:40  <antimatroid> the maps can't be "fixed", they're symmetric :P
2010-11-13T21:59:45  <krokkrok> really, messing around with the maps is a huge waste of time.  getting the ranking system to approximate the correct answer matters more. otherwise, this is just a lottery
2010-11-13T21:59:46  <janzert> the website one?
2010-11-13T21:59:59  <janzert> Zannick: I did try refreshing
2010-11-13T22:00:16  <Zannick> antimatroid: have you watched any games? the maps are offcenter, badly
2010-11-13T22:00:21  <antimatroid> krokkrok: the ranking system is pretty damn good at the moment
2010-11-13T22:00:25  <Zannick> oh
2010-11-13T22:00:27  <Zannick> huh
2010-11-13T22:00:28  <antimatroid> Zannick: i have
2010-11-13T22:00:28  <krokkrok> prove it
2010-11-13T22:00:29  <Zannick> janzert: great
2010-11-13T22:00:33  <krokkrok> you cant prove it
2010-11-13T22:00:39  <antimatroid> no, you never can
2010-11-13T22:00:40  <krokkrok> i *can* prove it doesnt work
2010-11-13T22:00:43  <antimatroid> but i was around for tron
2010-11-13T22:00:51  <antimatroid> and compared to that, it's a million times better
2010-11-13T22:01:18  <antimatroid> and i was sustaining first rank for that quite often towards the end, so if anything i'd have been biased towards the old method
2010-11-13T22:01:32  <Mjothvitnir> what was tron?
2010-11-13T22:01:38  <antimatroid> http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/rankings.php
2010-11-13T22:01:40  <antimatroid> last ai contest
2010-11-13T22:01:45  <antimatroid> in february
2010-11-13T22:01:52  <Mjothvitnir> sorry, I mean what ranking system
2010-11-13T22:01:55  <krokkrok> this make no sense: you are saying calculating the correct answer is worse that calculating some random ELO
2010-11-13T22:01:57  <antimatroid> i got disqualified in the final tournamnet for timing out :(
2010-11-13T22:02:14  <antimatroid> krokkrok: we've bene over this, you can't calculate the correct answer
2010-11-13T22:02:26  <krokkrok> there is a correct answer. do you agree?
2010-11-13T22:02:37  <antimatroid> no
2010-11-13T22:02:44  <antimatroid> not if you include time constraints
2010-11-13T22:02:56  <krokkrok> huh? everyone has the same contraints
2010-11-13T22:02:56  <antimatroid> and it's being unrealistic not to
2010-11-13T22:03:13  <antimatroid> time constraints for obtaining your ranking over bots
2010-11-13T22:03:16  <Mjothvitnir> I think antim means get the answer in X days
2010-11-13T22:03:40  <antimatroid> i would like a longer contest, at least a week, but i don't think that method would be feasible even then

2010-11-13T22:06:07  <Mjothvitnir> 100bots x 99 bots * 30 maps * 100 turns * 1 sec/turn = 343 days
2010-11-13T22:06:12  <antimatroid> i suck at counting
2010-11-13T22:06:28  <amstan> Mjothvitnir: *30 maps? lol
2010-11-13T22:06:30  <amstan> no way
2010-11-13T22:06:32  <amstan> 1 map max
2010-11-13T22:06:42  <Zannick> divide by 2, you're double counting the pairs
2010-11-13T22:06:44  <antimatroid> amstan: the point is that it's not feasible
2010-11-13T22:06:49  <Mjothvitnir> so that's 10 days then
2010-11-13T22:07:00  <antimatroid> the limit is 200 turns too
2010-11-13T22:07:00  <krokkrok> its not 10 days
2010-11-13T22:07:17  <Mjothvitnir> sorry I menat 34 days
2010-11-13T22:07:24  <amstan> what we did last time: we played top 25 for a while alone, without anyone else
2010-11-13T22:07:27  <krokkrok> not all bots take 1 second per turn, as we can see, it can run 124000 games a day
2010-11-13T22:07:32  <Mjothvitnir> I picked 100 since not all go to 200
2010-11-13T22:07:38  <amstan> since the pairings are random, it's all good
2010-11-13T22:07:49  <antimatroid> the pairings are no longer random
2010-11-13T22:07:56  <antimatroid> not completely
2010-11-13T22:08:02  <antimatroid> but completely random sucked
2010-11-13T22:08:08  <amstan> well.. w/e
2010-11-13T22:08:15  <krokkrok> any randomness in the ranking makes it a lottery
2010-11-13T22:08:17  <amstan> it'll be luck based on what games you get
2010-11-13T22:08:21  <krokkrok> you can do it with zero randomness
2010-11-13T22:08:25  <Mjothvitnir> I was counting KrokKrok method everybot plays every bot on every map
2010-11-13T22:08:31  <amstan> krokkrok: you can't if you wanna play everyone vs everyone
2010-11-13T22:08:56  <krokkrok> its top 100 ELO vs top 100 ELO only, all bots play all bots
2010-11-13T22:09:07  <amstan> that's why there's elo.. so we can get away with not playing a lot of the bots, while still having the same rankings
2010-11-13T22:09:11  <Mjothvitnir> but yes as someone said I am counting double
2010-11-13T22:09:15  <amstan> s/bot/pairs
2010-11-13T22:09:38  <antimatroid> amstan: next time, i do like having very general rules, but i think it's important people are told more explicitly that the maps will change, and if it's said that they will, one can't then leave them :)
2010-11-13T22:09:44  <krokkrok> ELO is an approximation, the method being used now creats local minima when it tries to fit bots into a rank
2010-11-13T22:10:10  <krokkrok> so approximate the top 100, then 100 vs 100, get the right answer, ezpz
2010-11-13T22:10:33  <antimatroid> i do admit, i would be in favour of something like that, maybe not top 100, 50 or 25 maybe?
2010-11-13T22:10:42  <Mjothvitnir> actually antimatroid we were told that they WOULD change, just not HOW they would change
2010-11-13T22:10:52  <antimatroid> krokkrok: but then, the top 100 rankings are made up only of games played with other top 100 bots
2010-11-13T22:11:01  <antimatroid> so if they suck against ragebot as you said, that can never happen
2010-11-13T22:11:14  <krokkrok> indeed, it is still top perfect, but..its much better
2010-11-13T22:11:51  <antimatroid> different symmetries were used for the tron map generator when that was finally made
2010-11-13T22:11:55  <antimatroid> and that was way later in the contest

2010-11-13T22:14:37  <antimatroid> i'd be quite surprised
2010-11-13T22:15:02  <Zannick> my bot did a nice center planet snipe to win one of those games

2010-11-13T22:15:13  <Zannick> not quite center, i mean

2010-11-13T22:16:53  <Mjothvitnir> true all we know is what they said I think they claimed 1000 maps of "old" type and I don't remember a number for "new" maps probably how many ever were in the first bundle
2010-11-13T22:16:54  <janzert> Accoun seems to crash rather frequently on them for some reason
2010-11-13T22:17:02  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4377), bix0r4ever(4225), GreenTea(4171), DarthMasta(4061), dmj111(4054), george(4037), Accoun(4006), asavis(4001), shangas(3981), oldman(3969)
2010-11-13T22:17:05  <janzert> no idea if it's the symmetry or what though
2010-11-13T22:17:17  <Mjothvitnir> prolly, planet #
2010-11-13T22:17:20  <amstan> janzert: count the plants, yeah
2010-11-13T22:17:26  <lavalamp_> my bot has an issue with lots of equidistant planets atm, but it's because it has a sniping problem
2010-11-13T22:17:37  <Zannick> oh, heh, right, the planet count is different
2010-11-13T22:17:47  <janzert> except it's not on first turn
2010-11-13T22:17:58  <Zannick> my bot is fine up until 65 planets..
2010-11-13T22:18:06  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@chello089077208118.chello.pl> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
2010-11-13T22:18:10  <janzert> and he's now resubmitted so I can't pull them up easily
2010-11-13T22:18:25  <Mjothvitnir> turns out I tried to save calculations in my first-turn nap sack by assuming there were only going to be at max 15 plnets equadistant or less . . . OOPS
2010-11-13T22:18:42  <antimatroid> we could ask
2010-11-13T22:19:01  <Zannick> i'm sure he'll tell us if he needs to
2010-11-13T22:20:22  <lavalamp_> I think best would have been if they'd told us max and min parameters, and then unleashed a brand new map gen (that stayed within those parameters) on the last day
2010-11-13T22:20:37  <Zannick> yeah
2010-11-13T22:20:43  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: that's what i mean by general but clear rules
2010-11-13T22:20:47  <antimatroid> i want that next time
2010-11-13T22:20:59  <Zannick> we will do that next time, no doubt
2010-11-13T22:21:07  *** iFire <iFire!~kittens@unaffiliated/ifire> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-11-13T22:21:07  <lavalamp_> yeah... they have to tell us what we can depend on
2010-11-13T22:21:07  <Zannick> we will do a lot of things next time :P
2010-11-13T22:21:08  <antimatroid> Zannick: i said that after tron
2010-11-13T22:21:33  <Zannick> antimatroid: and did you do that? :P
2010-11-13T22:21:36  <janzert> can you imagine the outrage if even 10% of the bots ended up crashing in the final tournament with the new generator though
2010-11-13T22:21:37  <antimatroid> imo, the most important change was made
2010-11-13T22:21:38  <Mjothvitnir> OK, note to self :) come back to contest in 5 years to see if they have ironed out all the bugs. ;)
2010-11-13T22:21:42  <antimatroid> you no longer get disqualified for timing out
2010-11-13T22:21:51  <janzert> I'd rather not completely tick off 400 people
2010-11-13T22:22:11  <antimatroid> janzert: that's why even generalness needs to be very clear
2010-11-13T22:22:14  <Zannick> that's why i'm glad some things stayed constant
2010-11-13T22:22:22  <janzert> even if it was explicitly stated everywhere people are *not* going to like it
2010-11-13T22:22:37  <dmj111> I made no assumptions on the maps.  But, I also was slightly afraid of crashing at  the end (i.e., the 500 planet stress test).  Since the maps hadn't changed for so long, maybe people assumed that the wouldn't.  During the tron contest, the maps started changing fairly quickly into the contest, so we all realized that the maps could change.
2010-11-13T22:22:53  <dmj111> Also, during tron, the maps were pretty identifiable.  So, everyone could tell they were changing.
2010-11-13T22:23:10  <antimatroid> you'd have trouble missing the change with a lot of these
2010-11-13T22:23:14  <Zannick> what we really need to do is have more than one map generator
2010-11-13T22:23:19  <Zannick> for next time, i mean
2010-11-13T22:23:24  <janzert> why?
2010-11-13T22:23:32  <antimatroid> one map generator is fine, a less general one
2010-11-13T22:23:41  <antimatroid> more general***
2010-11-13T22:23:46  *** iFire <iFire!~kittens@unaffiliated/ifire> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-13T22:23:54  <Mjothvitnir> janzert does"New submissions" on the Server Stat page mean NEW bots or anyone's submittals
2010-11-13T22:24:06  <janzert> anyone's submissions
2010-11-13T22:24:06  <Zannick> i mean, like the new one
2010-11-13T22:24:12  <antimatroid> janzert: if too many people crash, maybe try restricting maps to 23 planets again?
2010-11-13T22:24:13  <Zannick> it's essentially two in one
2010-11-13T22:24:18  <antimatroid> i don't think line symmetry should cause any crashes
2010-11-13T22:24:29  <antimatroid> or very few, and if people assumed that, they really did fuck themselves over
2010-11-13T22:24:31  <janzert> antimatroid: yeah, but I think we are fine
2010-11-13T22:24:32  <Zannick> but the point is to have sufficiently different maps
2010-11-13T22:24:55  <Zannick> line symmetry won't crash copybot, in fact, but it may do some weird things
2010-11-13T22:25:00  <Mjothvitnir> can you ask the DB how many people have made submission in say the last week (we talk about 4000+ players but I doubt all are still active)
2010-11-13T22:25:20  <Mjothvitnir> yes I know somebody may not be uploading "weekly" but still
2010-11-13T22:25:31  <janzert> the big difference is in the tron contest there were a few participants that made map generators and the contest was able to pull from that pool of ideas
2010-11-13T22:26:02  <janzert> here no one really released any with big differences that the community really got into
2010-11-13T22:26:19  <Zannick> well, till now :)
2010-11-13T22:26:22  <antimatroid> nobody really released any with big differences did they?
2010-11-13T22:26:36  <Zannick> the rps maps don't really count
2010-11-13T22:26:42  <antimatroid> people had talked about these maps but no one ever did them and i only just finished exams from an overloaded semester last week

2010-11-13T22:34:01  <Mjothvitnir> 15 vs 7 vs 12
2010-11-13T22:34:13  <antimatroid> 7  wasnt line symmetric too
2010-11-13T22:34:32  <Mjothvitnir> huh
2010-11-13T22:34:38  <antimatroid> wanted*
2010-11-13T22:34:49  <antimatroid> so 19 people wanted line symmetry, 15 didn't
2010-11-13T22:35:11  <Mjothvitnir> but 7 didn't want planet # change
2010-11-13T22:35:25  <antimatroid> i'm completely indifferent to that, feel free to rip that out
2010-11-13T22:35:28  <antimatroid> i think it makes no difference
2010-11-13T22:35:35  <Mjothvitnir> still 34 people vs 4000+ isn't a minority in your book
2010-11-13T22:35:36  <Accoun> antimatroid> Canadian creepy
2010-11-13T22:35:37  <antimatroid> i just wanted more general maps as promised
2010-11-13T22:35:56  <antimatroid> where'd you pull 4000+ opposition from?
2010-11-13T22:36:15  <Mjothvitnir> 34 people voted vrs 4000+ who didn't
2010-11-13T22:36:15  <Accoun> antimatroid> bad boy
2010-11-13T22:36:22  <Zannick> 4000 abstentions
2010-11-13T22:36:26  <antimatroid> Accoun: :)
2010-11-13T22:37:06  <Mjothvitnir> they weren't abtentions, the vast majority never even knew there was a "vote"
2010-11-13T22:37:11  <antimatroid> it was always intended that a map generator would be made like this, and i would consider it fair for them to just use maps like that in the final contest
2010-11-13T22:37:36  <Mjothvitnir> "like that"??
2010-11-13T22:37:46  <antimatroid> i was always warned in both contests the rules are meant to be like that, but like i've said, i do wish it was outlined more clearly
2010-11-13T22:37:58  <antimatroid> brand new types of maps
2010-11-13T22:38:24  * lavalamp_ puts marshmellows on stick, holds in front of monitor
2010-11-13T22:38:35  <antimatroid> :P
2010-11-13T22:38:51  <Accoun> last yar this canadia organizers make the same evil things
2010-11-13T22:38:54  <Mjothvitnir> so you are cool if a drastic (for arguement sake) change is made at 12:01 on the 28th.
2010-11-13T22:39:05  <antimatroid> Accoun: that's because it was intended both times
2010-11-13T22:39:09  <Accoun> this  http://openpaste.org/en/19644/ writen
2010-11-13T22:39:31  <antimatroid> Mjothvitnir: this isn't a drastic change as far as i'm concerned, i've always written my bot to work under such general conditions
2010-11-13T22:40:18  <antimatroid> the reason they SHOULD be changed is because otherwise people who assumed their own rules got a 2 month advantage on a restricted domain of maps for their bot to work on
2010-11-13T22:40:56  <Mjothvitnir> so is mine (with a few oopses). we agree that nothing was in stone, we agree that there should have been more guidelines, you disagree on stuff because of personal knowledge (tron contest)
2010-11-13T22:41:05  <Accoun> and were caught on the selective removal of the results of games
2010-11-13T22:41:20  <antimatroid> selective removal?
2010-11-13T22:41:24  <Accoun> yes
2010-11-13T22:41:36  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2010-11-13T22:42:12  <antimatroid> "This rewards good AI algorithms, and punishes strategies that are designed with particular maps in mind." That is exactly the point btw
2010-11-13T22:42:20  <antimatroid> it is an ai contest afterall
2010-11-13T22:42:50  <Accoun> final games be maked hidden in process and in publised resilt amount of games plaed by some top bots be radicale less than ozer
2010-11-13T22:43:29  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm pretty sure rankings weren't reset when the final contest ran last time
2010-11-13T22:43:45  <antimatroid> i have made sure people know not to let that happen again
2010-11-13T22:44:07  <antimatroid> and you can no longer get disqualified for timing out
2010-11-13T22:44:13  <Accoun> it canadian
2010-11-13T22:44:18  <antimatroid> i had a top 10 quality bot last time and got dq'd for that
2010-11-13T22:44:20  <Mjothvitnir> if there was a prize to this contest then I might suspect that "we'll create maps rules and game rules, and contest method at the last minute" means that they will stack the deck
2010-11-13T22:44:22  <Accoun> caontru of stupednes
2010-11-13T22:45:17  <Accoun> last year final games be maked hidden in process and in publised resilt amount of games plaed by some top bots be radicale less than ozer

2010-11-13T22:46:45  <antimatroid> yes game amounts weren't equal last time, i didn't like that and I don't think it will  happen this time
2010-11-13T22:46:49  <antimatroid> although i'm not positive
2010-11-13T22:47:19  <Mjothvitnir> nobody knows anything about what will/won't happen

2010-11-13T22:47:50  <antimatroid> Accoun: are you referring to the leaderboard not being viewable?

2010-11-13T22:50:39  <antimatroid> janzert: what are your current thoughts on the leaderboard being live? i think that's another decent point, people are much less likely to complain about games being "removed" if they can see their games throughout the contest
2010-11-13T22:51:44  <janzert> I think a live leaderboard helps keep the community alive, but I can also see wanting to not spoil the surprise of the winner
2010-11-13T22:51:58  <janzert> overall I'd prefer keeping it live
2010-11-13T22:52:12  <antimatroid> good, it was so painful waiting around not knowing
2010-11-13T22:52:22  <Zannick> i think hiding the games spoils the idea that this contest is open
2010-11-13T22:52:40  <antimatroid> yeah, watching the leaderboard evolve and watching the top games will be exciting
2010-11-13T22:52:42  <Zannick> it seems like a poor idea to me
2010-11-13T22:53:59  <Accoun> last yaer result comlety chiting
2010-11-13T22:54:22  <janzert> then why in the world do you come back again?
2010-11-13T22:55:00  <antimatroid> hoping it would be better, which it is, but there are still things that need ironing out
2010-11-13T22:55:08  <antimatroid> but it's a new contest, these things are going to happen
2010-11-13T22:55:22  <janzert> nah, not you Accoun
2010-11-13T22:55:46  <janzert> he seems to believe in malicious action on the part of the organizers
2010-11-13T22:56:02  <janzert> I can't understand why you'd come back in that case
2010-11-13T22:56:21  <Zannick> well, if trying to steal everyone's free time is malicious... ;)
2010-11-13T22:56:39  <janzert> hehe
2010-11-13T22:56:55  <lavalamp_> trying? they're pretty damn good at it...
2010-11-13T22:57:11  <antimatroid> they don't just steal my free time
2010-11-13T22:57:17  <Zannick> not me, i'm free!
2010-11-13T22:57:30  <antimatroid> yeah, i finished undergrad under a week ago :)
2010-11-13T22:57:34  <antimatroid> feels good still
2010-11-13T22:59:27  <Zannick> congrats :)
2010-11-13T23:00:39  <antimatroid> Accoun: were you actually relying on point symmetry?
2010-11-13T23:04:40  <Accoun> very evil canadian!

2010-11-13T23:05:46  <Zannick> or the planet size being 23
2010-11-13T23:06:09  <lavalamp_> where's the fancy visualizer? I want to recover a game from the tcp server
2010-11-13T23:06:10  <antimatroid> Account: i'm australian, you can hate a whole new nationality now too
2010-11-13T23:06:36  <lavalamp_> aren't you worried about getting bombed second?
2010-11-13T23:06:37  <antimatroid> Zannick: planet size change is easy, relying on point symmetry would be ingrained in the strategy
2010-11-13T23:07:01  <antimatroid> but it's not something someone did without just flat out assuming it
2010-11-13T23:07:01  <lavalamp_> I considered relying on point symmetry for my first move
2010-11-13T23:07:22  <lavalamp_> but it's not something I'd gotten to yet
2010-11-13T23:07:30  <antimatroid> and i argue that it's unfair people got to work for 2 months under that restriction

2010-11-13T23:09:26  <burny> it could be interesting to do psuedo symetrical..

2010-11-13T23:09:48  <burny> like, it's symetrical from each base.. but not symetrical from every other point
2010-11-13T23:10:04  <burny> since distances are rounded up to integer
2010-11-13T23:10:09  <antimatroid> wait what
2010-11-13T23:10:13  <antimatroid> aren't maps like that now?
2010-11-13T23:10:19  <antimatroid> at least line symmetric ones
2010-11-13T23:10:21  <Zannick> i don't think i understand
2010-11-13T23:10:37  <antimatroid> the maps are symmetric around the origin, then translated
2010-11-13T23:10:48  <antimatroid> and symmetric for players starting positions
2010-11-13T23:11:06  <burny> if you have planets ABC, opposite from planets DEF.. the distance ebtween AD and CF doesn't need to be equal

2010-11-13T23:11:40  <Zannick> you have to be able to apply a transformation to the map to switch the players
2010-11-13T23:12:11  <Zannick> burny: no... because then you can get nonsymmetry in distances from B and E and then the map isn't symmetrical
2010-11-13T23:12:44  <burny> thus the 'psuedo' symetrical :P
2010-11-13T23:13:01  <Zannick> there isn't a pseudo to it
2010-11-13T23:13:20  <burny> <burny> it could be interesting to do psuedo symetrical
2010-11-13T23:13:30  <Zannick> it's either symmetrical or not
2010-11-13T23:13:56  <Zannick> if B and E are the starters, then you have to have distances the same from them to mirrored planets
2010-11-13T23:14:54  <burny> the distances from B and E to all other planets can be mirror'd, without the distances between those planets being 100% mirror'd
2010-11-13T23:15:15  <Zannick> if A and F are a mirrored pair and C and D the other, then distances AD and CF must be the same
2010-11-13T23:15:19  <Zannick> as otherwise
2010-11-13T23:15:45  <Zannick> B to A then to D is not the same time as E to F to C
2010-11-13T23:17:03  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4361), Raschi(4154), bix0r4ever(4154), GreenTea(4123), dmj111(4028), george(4014), asavis(3977), shangas(3970), DarthMasta(3962), Accoun(3950)
2010-11-13T23:17:10  <Zannick> i think you'd also get noneuclidean things when you look at the triangles BAD and EFC, as BA=EF and BD=EC, but AD is not equal to FC
2010-11-13T23:17:27  <burny> eg. instead of distances 2.4, 3.5, 2.4  it could be A 2.4, B 3.5, C 2.6 D.. distances are still 3,4,3.. but the distance from BD not= AC
2010-11-13T23:18:13  <Zannick> oh
2010-11-13T23:18:51  <Zannick> well, if you manage that without changing the integer values used in-game for distance, that's not really different
2010-11-13T23:19:17  <burny> thatmakes AC=6 and BD=7
2010-11-13T23:19:54  <Zannick> then it's not symmetrical
2010-11-13T23:19:59  <burny> obviously

2010-11-13T23:21:29  <Zannick> if A and D are starters, A can reach B and C before the other player
2010-11-13T23:21:35  <burny> both players have different advantages
2010-11-13T23:21:55  <burny> one can attack more easily..

2010-11-13T23:22:06  <Accoun>  
2010-11-13T23:22:12  <Accoun> found it
2010-11-13T23:22:41  <Accoun> "That could explain a difference in number of games played per contestant of 50 or 100, but not a difference of over 500 as actually observed."
2010-11-13T23:22:42  <Zannick> yes, and that inequality is something we have to avoid
2010-11-13T23:24:43  <antimatroid> Accoun: have you considered any messups were just that, and not blatent tampering?
2010-11-13T23:25:07  <antimatroid> and if i'm correct and rankings weren't reset when the final contest ran
2010-11-13T23:25:18  <antimatroid> a lot of crap bots would have been quite old, and have had a lot of games in their history
2010-11-13T23:25:37  <antimatroid> that would explain crap bots having more games
2010-11-13T23:26:11  <Accoun> antimatroid> if it not chiting why ginal games process be hidden?
2010-11-13T23:26:19  <Accoun> antimatroid> if it not chiting why final games process be hidden?
2010-11-13T23:26:56  <antimatroid> Accoun: the contest is open source this time around
2010-11-13T23:27:01  <antimatroid> all code can be viewed
2010-11-13T23:27:39  <Accoun> antimatroid> and some games result be deleted
2010-11-13T23:27:57  <Accoun> antimatroid> manyaly by hands
2010-11-13T23:28:20  <antimatroid> one thing that might have happened last time, they were removing maps that resulted in lots of draws and i have no idea how they did that
2010-11-13T23:28:35  <antimatroid> if they removed those results, people may have lost win results
2010-11-13T23:28:49  <antimatroid> it wont happen like that again, i'm pretty sure janzert is on top of such problems
2010-11-13T23:28:52  <antimatroid> janzert <3
2010-11-13T23:29:05  <Accoun> janzert is on top

2010-11-13T23:33:15  <Accoun> antimatroid> new maps not so bad, bad idea to make changes in last week
2010-11-13T23:33:52  <antimatroid> there's still at least 2 weeks left

2010-11-13T23:34:03  <antimatroid> actually, 2 weeks exactly pretty much
2010-11-13T23:34:18  <Accoun> antimatroid>  2 weeks is nothong
2010-11-13T23:34:53  <Accoun> antimatroid> this yar problem more complex than last year
2010-11-13T23:35:29  <antimatroid> last contest was this year :P but i always screw that up
2010-11-13T23:35:40  <antimatroid> all bots are meant to be able to handle maps like this already
2010-11-13T23:36:07  <antimatroid> i am trolling profiles like nothing else, i can't find any significant different in peoples win/loss ratios as yet
2010-11-13T23:36:13  <antimatroid> but i'm only looking in the top 20
2010-11-13T23:38:30  <antimatroid> actually, flow bot seems to be doing worse
