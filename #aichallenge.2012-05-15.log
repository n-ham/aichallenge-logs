2012-05-15T10:51:54  <mleise> or maybe a comic chat with all those nice icons of swinging fists, skulls, poison warnings

2012-05-15T10:59:25  <antimatroid> yeah what?
2012-05-15T10:59:40  <amstan> i guess he was offering the chicks he wanted to marry money
2012-05-15T10:59:51  <antimatroid> haha
2012-05-15T11:00:00  <mleise> uhm maybe :)
2012-05-15T11:00:14  <mcstar> you need marrying if you dont have manoey
2012-05-15T11:00:17  <mcstar> money*
2012-05-15T11:00:25  <mcstar> if you have money you never have to marry anyone
2012-05-15T11:00:42  <mleise> mcstar: that's what she said
2012-05-15T11:00:50  <rwest> mcstar: exactly, you get to keep upgrading to the younger generation^^
2012-05-15T11:01:22  * rwest is not a good human
2012-05-15T11:01:23  <antimatroid> meh, i'd just like to meet a really fun girl around my own age
2012-05-15T11:01:29  <amstan> +1
2012-05-15T11:01:52  <mcstar> its lame, but +1
2012-05-15T11:01:57  <rwest> haha
2012-05-15T11:02:17  <mleise> no that's silly
2012-05-15T11:02:21  <rwest> See the commitment is lame
2012-05-15T11:02:36  <mcstar> mleise: well, she can be younger, but not much
2012-05-15T11:02:40  <rwest> If I wanna go do something, I don't want to consult anybody
2012-05-15T11:02:55  <rwest> probably why I don't want kids
2012-05-15T11:02:56  <antimatroid> note the really fun specification
2012-05-15T11:03:03  <mcstar> yeah, that rare
2012-05-15T11:03:07  <mcstar> s
2012-05-15T11:03:24  <mleise> antimatroid: don't talk to her about specifications
2012-05-15T11:03:25  <rwest> that would be really hard to find
2012-05-15T11:03:39  <mleise> or maybe... she actually finds that funny
2012-05-15T11:03:39  <mcstar> wait, does fun girl and funny girl mean the same things?
2012-05-15T11:03:44  <rwest> LOL I expect a detailed spec by this afternoon
2012-05-15T11:03:56  <antimatroid> funny is a subset of fun imo
2012-05-15T11:03:56  <rwest> mcstar: not exactly
2012-05-15T11:04:15  <mleise> mcstar: I think a fun girl means that you have fun, and a funny girl means, she's having fun
2012-05-15T11:04:21  <mcstar> she can be a fun girl, if you put enough of your fun in her...
2012-05-15T11:04:37  <rwest> I took that to be something dirty
2012-05-15T11:04:37  <mleise> yeah! no we reached the level
2012-05-15T11:04:41  <mcstar> XD
2012-05-15T11:04:48  <antimatroid> you're all terrible :P
2012-05-15T11:04:48  <mcstar> that was my intention
2012-05-15T11:04:52  <antimatroid> i'm going to sleep
2012-05-15T11:04:52  <rwest> good
2012-05-15T11:05:02  <rwest> antimatroid: no, PLAY D3
2012-05-15T11:05:09  <antimatroid> don't play games
2012-05-15T11:06:04  <rwest> that's rare for programmers I think
2012-05-15T11:06:09  <rwest> well at least in the US
2012-05-15T11:06:37  <rwest> I got up at 3am to play before work when it launched, I saw half my company on IM
2012-05-15T11:08:01  <mcstar> whats d3?
2012-05-15T11:08:51  <mleise> it's probably not Doom3
2012-05-15T11:09:38  <mcstar> anyway, dont play games
2012-05-15T11:10:03  <mcstar> you do whatever you want, but i dont want to play games

2012-05-15T16:42:20  <mcstar> disappointment is the MOTD
2012-05-15T16:44:16  <rwest> Nope
2012-05-15T16:44:20  <thestinger> mcstar: hi
2012-05-15T16:44:28  <thestinger> did you do the crypto problem set?
2012-05-15T16:44:38  <thestinger> the programming part was fun
2012-05-15T16:44:55  <thestinger> but I was so bored by the elgamal videos that I didn't finish them :\
2012-05-15T16:45:49  <mcstar> yes
2012-05-15T16:46:12  <mcstar> i watched the videos quite some time ago
2012-05-15T16:46:22  <mcstar> so i read a bit of the pdf's
2012-05-15T16:46:55  <mcstar> i wrote something in python
2012-05-15T16:46:59  <mcstar> looks good
2012-05-15T16:47:07  <mcstar> but its quite slow
2012-05-15T16:47:12  <thestinger> I used gmpy.sqrt
2012-05-15T16:47:16  <thestinger> it's very quick
2012-05-15T16:47:18  <mcstar> i tried to vectorize it
2012-05-15T16:47:29  <mcstar> it has nothing to do with crypto
2012-05-15T16:47:34  <mcstar> that was easy
2012-05-15T16:47:41  <thestinger> oh, lol
2012-05-15T16:47:48  <mcstar> anyway, i rewrote it in c++, with armadillo
2012-05-15T16:47:55  <thestinger> I guess I missed something important :P
2012-05-15T16:48:06  <mcstar> now when i optimize -O>0, i get segfault
2012-05-15T16:48:33  <mcstar> and the last part is horribly slow, i have to check it out, but otherwise would be ok, if it worked
2012-05-15T16:49:36  <mcstar> nooooo
2012-05-15T16:49:42  <mcstar> some pople are stupid
2012-05-15T16:49:49  <mcstar> error: solve(): solution not found
2012-05-15T16:50:00  <mcstar> it went to stdout!!!!
2012-05-15T16:50:13  <mcstar> the solver throws an exception
2012-05-15T16:50:29  <mcstar> i hand le the exception, but in spite of this, it spits out this stupid message
2012-05-15T16:50:31  <mcstar> and not to stderr
2012-05-15T16:51:13  <mcstar> thestinger: ^^^
2012-05-15T16:51:49  <mcstar> i shouldnt make you part of my aggrevation
2012-05-15T16:52:08  <mcstar> or rather, shouldnt make you take part..

2012-05-15T17:39:26  <mcstar> maybe it isnt ready for production use
2012-05-15T17:39:36  <mcstar> but they advertise it quite nicely
2012-05-15T17:39:57  <mcstar> or rather, convincingly
2012-05-15T17:40:29  <thestinger> mcstar: did you try eigen or ublas?
2012-05-15T17:41:04  <mcstar> this would be nice, cause it has an idiomatic interface
2012-05-15T17:41:14  <mcstar> with overloaded operators an such
2012-05-15T17:41:19  <mcstar> and supports initializer lists
2012-05-15T17:41:24  <thestinger> http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
2012-05-15T17:41:26  <mcstar> and views on matrices
2012-05-15T17:41:33  <mcstar> and has a fusion model

2012-05-15T17:59:19  <amstan> oh arduino coders, how much i hate you
2012-05-15T17:59:29  <amstan> it's the worst code i have ever seen
2012-05-15T18:00:23  <mcstar> yeah
2012-05-15T18:00:43  <mcstar> code just simply sucks
2012-05-15T18:00:52  <amstan> sigh..
2012-05-15T18:00:59  <amstan> the number 1 rule in microcontrollers
2012-05-15T18:01:12  <amstan> if you're not sure what the pin is for, keep it as an input, don't output voltage on it
2012-05-15T18:01:25  <amstan> in this "sample code", every possible pin is an output
2012-05-15T18:02:34  <amstan> stuff from the standard library redeclared for no reason..
2012-05-15T18:02:48  <thestinger> amstan: you should see the rxvt-unicode source code...
2012-05-15T18:03:06  <amstan> i'm sure it looks better
2012-05-15T18:03:09  <thestinger> it's C++ and they make their own vector class
2012-05-15T18:03:20  <amstan> there must be a reason for that
2012-05-15T18:03:27  <amstan> this here is just pure stupidity
2012-05-15T18:03:29  <mcstar> maybe cause its old code
2012-05-15T18:03:35  <thestinger> there isn't a reason
2012-05-15T18:03:37  <mcstar> and there was no standard vector at that time
2012-05-15T18:03:48  <thestinger> mcstar: it was ported to C++ in ~2003/2004
2012-05-15T18:03:52  <amstan> nobody bothers to read the docs, not enough time because leds blinking are much more interesting
2012-05-15T18:04:00  <thestinger> and they copypasted a vector class from pre-C++98
2012-05-15T18:04:08  <amstan> yes, that's fine
2012-05-15T18:04:13  <amstan> but this is not
2012-05-15T18:04:18  <mcstar> XD
2012-05-15T18:04:28  <amstan> also, indentation with both tabs and spaces, one line with tabs, the other with spaces
2012-05-15T18:04:33  <thestinger> how about 37K lines of hardcoded tables of hex numbers?
2012-05-15T18:04:37  <thestinger> because urxvt has that :P
2012-05-15T18:05:47  <mcstar> thestinger: i think you can safely remove that part, i was told they left it in so that others dont mess with their code
2012-05-15T18:06:16  <mcstar> ofc im kidding
2012-05-15T18:06:21  <amstan> and this is not even my main project
2012-05-15T18:06:30  <amstan> i just want to get this code working so i can see my accelerometer work
2012-05-15T18:06:45  <amstan> i would have been done finding the original bug on my original microcontroller by now
2012-05-15T18:09:08  <mcstar> wtf just happened
2012-05-15T18:10:23  <mcstar> i dont see the errors in valgrind anymore
2012-05-15T18:11:35  <mcstar> ill sleep on this
