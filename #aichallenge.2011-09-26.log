2011-09-26T00:19:19  <ChrisH> I am getting a strange behavior when using the new tools to test my bot. My starting hive is being send as owned by player #3.
2011-09-26T00:19:32  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-09-26T00:19:39  <ChrisH> On a 4 player map.
2011-09-26T00:19:47  <McLeopold> you should always be player 0
2011-09-26T00:20:03  <ChrisH> yep, and my starting ant is player 0
2011-09-26T00:20:10  <ChrisH> just my hive is wrong
2011-09-26T00:20:15  <McLeopold> on the same spot for sure?
2011-09-26T00:20:31  <ChrisH> yep, just ran it with logged bot inputs, so it's not my code
2011-09-26T00:20:40  <McLeopold> what map?
2011-09-26T00:20:59  <janzert> McLeopold: did you see that last player standing is not being given points for the remaining hills?
2011-09-26T00:21:02  <ChrisH> the default, maze_9
2011-09-26T00:21:10  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, working on it
2011-09-26T00:21:24  <McLeopold> janzert: plus, I will kill bots without hills
2011-09-26T00:21:24  <janzert> oh, was working on it as well :}
2011-09-26T00:21:42  <janzert> heh, amstan convinced me they should remain
2011-09-26T00:21:48  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-26T00:21:50  <McLeopold> then...
2011-09-26T00:22:00  <McLeopold> how did he convince you?
2011-09-26T00:22:00  <janzert> but I'm really not sure either way right now
2011-09-26T00:22:37  <amstan> McLeopold: scenario: nestless ants win the game!
2011-09-26T00:22:39  <ChrisH> Should a bot with a dead hill be able to recapture it with live ants?  That seems intuitive.
2011-09-26T00:22:49  <janzert> that it was worth letting them keep trying to capture and that it may actually lead to shorter games anyway
2011-09-26T00:22:52  <McLeopold> ChrisH, no
2011-09-26T00:23:05  <janzert> once a hills is destroyed it's out

2011-09-26T00:23:18  <McLeopold> hmm, I probably need to test no hills left...
2011-09-26T00:23:24  <ChrisH> ok, any reason why?
2011-09-26T00:23:36  <McLeopold> ChrisH: janzert said so...
2011-09-26T00:23:40  <McLeopold> :D
2011-09-26T00:23:54  <janzert> it's introduces a non-reversible point in the game
2011-09-26T00:23:59  <McLeopold> Mainly, we want to limit the game length
2011-09-26T00:24:07  <_flag> If my opinion counts for anything, I'd rather have nestless ants roaming around trying to kill other hills than just a bunch of lifeless ants scattered all over the place
2011-09-26T00:24:10  <janzert> it helps bring the game length down
2011-09-26T00:24:28  <McLeopold> _flag: yes, it does matter, you've convinced me
2011-09-26T00:24:45  <janzert> :P
2011-09-26T00:25:14  <ChrisH> hmm, nestless ants as kingmaker, or out for revenge...
2011-09-26T00:25:22  <janzert> if a hill is stomped all over, just getting a friendly ant back on it doesn't redig all the necessary tunnels and chambers ;)
2011-09-26T00:25:27  <McLeopold> ChrisH: in the game, what position were you?
2011-09-26T00:25:37  <ChrisH> I was pos 3
2011-09-26T00:25:43  <ChrisH> so that matched the hill
2011-09-26T00:25:49  <McLeopold> yeah, I bet I didn't use the switch matrix
2011-09-26T00:26:28  <ChrisH> I wondered if that was the case.
2011-09-26T00:26:37  <janzert> so my naive method of checking for one remaining_player and then calling raze_hill on any non-destroyed hills inside finish_game doesn't work :P
2011-09-26T00:26:59  <janzert> I'm guessing because the scores at that point never get into the replay

2011-09-26T00:28:15  <ChrisH> I'm done for the night. The new game looks interesting. I'll work on my bot some more once the hill numbering gets fixed.

2011-09-26T00:28:43  <McLeopold> janzert: when the game ends, do we want to spread the remaining hill points across all the survivors?

2011-09-26T00:29:24  <janzert> at this point I think only if there just one player with ants left
2011-09-26T00:29:55  <janzert> but as with everything I reserve the right to change my mind after watching more games with that in place :P
2011-09-26T00:29:57  <McLeopold> not including timeouts/crashes of course
2011-09-26T00:30:18  <janzert> right, I really meant the player alive
2011-09-26T00:30:34  <janzert> just the visualizer at this point doesn't seem to show a player dead when all the ants are dead
2011-09-26T00:30:40  <McLeopold> so, if player a takes player b's hill, but then gets eliminated, and player b survives to the end, who did better?
2011-09-26T00:30:58  <janzert> :)
2011-09-26T00:31:21  <janzert> if player b is the only surviving player then I say b
2011-09-26T00:31:25  <janzert> I suppose
2011-09-26T00:31:46  <McLeopold> and if not? does it make a difference if there is a 3rd player or not?
2011-09-26T00:32:30  <janzert> the idea for me right now is that we end the game when only one player is left, most likely if we let the game run he would be able to eventually capture all the remaining hills
2011-09-26T00:32:36  <janzert> but for efficiency we don't do that
2011-09-26T00:33:06  <McLeopold> okay, so lone survivor get's the points
2011-09-26T00:33:15  <McLeopold> that makes sense
2011-09-26T00:33:16  <janzert> there are obviously situations where that doesn't hold but I think we can ignore that
2011-09-26T00:33:20  <McLeopold> what about 2 survivors?
2011-09-26T00:33:31  <janzert> that's where I'm less sure
2011-09-26T00:33:49  <janzert> but for now I think no bonus for them
2011-09-26T00:34:39  <janzert> I don't know though I could pretty easily go the other way
2011-09-26T00:35:24  <janzert> I suppose the above reasoning for the lone player case can be applied to any non-destroyed hills of dead players
2011-09-26T00:35:46  <janzert> in the multiplayer case
2011-09-26T00:36:21  <janzert> so go for whichever you feel like ;)
2011-09-26T00:37:21  <janzert> I guess my feeling against it is that if the game ended with multiple players alive and viable hills of dead players then it's likely the living players just weren't trying to destroy them very hard
2011-09-26T00:39:14  <janzert> are sigma's being raised based on population turn over?
2011-09-26T00:39:41  <janzert> I think that may be rather important when starting from zip like we are
2011-09-26T00:49:34  <McLeopold> I'm okay with no bonus, I just don't want a game to end for someone still trying and get cheated out of points.
2011-09-26T00:50:07  <McLeopold> sigma's are changed by trueskill, which has no knowledge of our game mechanics
2011-09-26T00:50:40  <McLeopold> the tau, or dynamics factor should do the raising
2011-09-26T00:50:56  <janzert> well, part of the trueskill system is to raise sigma so much over time
2011-09-26T00:51:02  <janzert> but we took that out
2011-09-26T00:51:22  <McLeopold> yes we did, but the more I read, the more I think tau is suppose to do that
2011-09-26T00:51:25  <janzert> and I thought we were going to replace it to match the population turnover
2011-09-26T00:51:55  <janzert> ah, ok
2011-09-26T00:52:05  <McLeopold> they don't really go below 1.5-1.8, so I think we are ok
2011-09-26T00:52:32  <McLeopold> we can increase tau first, if we think they are too low
2011-09-26T00:53:58  <McLeopold> were extinct bots marked as dead before the rule change?

2011-09-26T00:54:40  <janzert> well bots that lost all there ants certainly were ;)
2011-09-26T00:55:07  <janzert> and I think that is still the interesting spot to mark in the graph
2011-09-26T00:55:33  <janzert> and yes, timeouts and crashes also are/were
2011-09-26T00:56:59  <McLeopold> hmm, okay, I think that is just the visualizer
2011-09-26T00:57:08  <McLeopold> I didn't change any replay format stuff for that

2011-09-26T01:01:19  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm inclined to remove the cutoff for this week, just to see how stuff will go
2011-09-26T01:01:43  <McLeopold> I think the logic doesn't make as much sense now that ants only spawn at the hills
2011-09-26T01:01:44  <janzert> hmm, here's an example of a game that would be 25% shorter if ants without hills were eliminated :( http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=60
2011-09-26T01:03:35  <McLeopold> oh, maybe need to stop of only one bot has hills?
2011-09-26T01:03:54  <janzert> I think maybe the food cutoff needs to be reworked, but I'm not so sure about the general overbearing% of ants cutoff
2011-09-26T01:04:08  <janzert> yeah, I'm not sure
2011-09-26T01:04:17  <janzert> that might make sense
2011-09-26T01:04:48  <janzert> theoretically the rank could still change, but I don't think it would hardly ever happen in practice
2011-09-26T01:04:59  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-26T01:05:16  <McLeopold> we need a list of edge cases
2011-09-26T01:05:33  <McLeopold> I'm thinking if  you lose your hill, you don't deserve the chance to come back
2011-09-26T01:05:33  <janzert> I guess leave it for the moment and see how it feels as we see more games
2011-09-26T01:06:37  <McLeopold> so, if green had lost his hill first instead, magenta still gets an opportunity to come back, but not the other way around
2011-09-26T01:07:01  <McLeopold> so the can_rank_change check is only applied to bots with surviving hills
2011-09-26T01:07:46  <janzert> hmm, sounds reasonable
2011-09-26T01:07:49  <McLeopold> if you lose your hills, you still get to participate somewhat, but the cutoffs and other game length decisions won't depend on you
2011-09-26T01:08:01  <janzert> and a nice compromise between completely eliminating them
2011-09-26T01:08:06  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-26T01:08:14  <McLeopold> I'm going to implement that, in about 30 minutes
2011-09-26T01:08:20  <janzert> great
2011-09-26T01:10:52  <janzert> I'm liking the way that battle lines develop much more naturally. although the map type might be having some effect on it as well
2011-09-26T01:10:59  <janzert> could we add a few of the old maps back in?
2011-09-26T01:16:21  <McLeopold> janzert: not yet, please, but soon

2011-09-26T01:52:25  <janzert> and since 0 point players basically disappear in the current score display, it's rather wierd not to have them when they are ahead of the negative scorers
2011-09-26T01:52:33  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-26T01:52:41  <McLeopold> okay, give me a minute
2011-09-26T01:53:13  <janzert> I just think it overall will look a little nicer, it doesn't make any difference except cosmetically of course
2011-09-26T01:53:40  <_flag> Also, because of the way mazes are done, I'm not even sure most of these games will ever end in anything other than a draw given the current turn limits
2011-09-26T01:53:53  <_flag> It takes a few hundred turns just to reach your opponent
2011-09-26T01:55:10  <janzert> yeah, I don't think the large mazes are going to work out particularly well
2011-09-26T01:55:32  <janzert> the smaller ones seem rather fun though
2011-09-26T01:56:32  <CIA-24> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * rac21371 / ants/ants.py : prevent negative scores - http://git.io/SQWslQ
2011-09-26T01:57:05  <_flag> Also, it would be nice if the hill numbers matched the player numbers, so your hill was always 0, the next person you saw was 1, etc.
2011-09-26T01:57:20  <_flag> I made my bot assuming that and now it's doing dumb things :(
2011-09-26T01:57:22  <McLeopold> _flag: there was a fix for that tonight
2011-09-26T01:57:41  <_flag> Can you push it to the main server before my bot loses a bunch of games?
2011-09-26T01:57:43  <janzert> I assume I can update now?
2011-09-26T01:57:44  <_flag> :)
2011-09-26T01:58:21  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-26T01:59:07  <janzert> should be up
2011-09-26T01:59:15  <janzert> rebuilt tools as well
2011-09-26T01:59:36  <McLeopold> janzert: we should be able to calc a distance table for opponents
2011-09-26T01:59:50  <McLeopold> that would give us a reasonable max_turns for a map
2011-09-26T02:00:16  <janzert> I'm thinking initial food needs to do something like that as well
2011-09-26T02:00:44  <McLeopold> more initial food when the distance is large?
2011-09-26T02:01:06  <janzert> well right now we get situations where food is initially visible but can be quite far away for a bot to get to
2011-09-26T02:01:20  <McLeopold> oh, yeah
2011-09-26T02:01:44  <McLeopold> I need to check visibility *and* path finding
2011-09-26T02:02:01  <janzert> it's just several things that didn't arise with non-mazelike maps :/
2011-09-26T02:02:12  <McLeopold> that shouldn't be too hard
2011-09-26T02:03:03  <McLeopold> I can to a flood fill to the vision radius at each hill to get the set of initial food squares
2011-09-26T02:03:53  <janzert> that would help the initial ability to get a few ants going out for sure
2011-09-26T02:05:04  <janzert> I think this is probably just going to be too much for  a 2 player map no matter what though http://antsbeta.janzert.com/map.php?map=maze/maze_2.map

2011-09-26T02:05:49  <janzert> even if there was no food cutoff whatsoever it's just going to take forever to play that out
2011-09-26T02:07:06  <janzert> it takes *me* a long time just to find the route between the hills ;)

2011-09-26T02:10:10  <janzert> A good rule of thumb might be that maximum travel distance between any two points on a map should be no more than say 25% (less/more?) of the hard turn limit (1500/2000?)
2011-09-26T02:10:58  <janzert> 25% is probably really pushing it
2011-09-26T02:12:32  <janzert> 10-15% is probably a more reasonable limit
2011-09-26T02:15:14  <McLeopold> I'll just check max between any 2 hills
2011-09-26T02:15:54  <McLeopold> then a map can have rabbit trails, but they will not be significant
2011-09-26T02:16:01  <_flag> Especially since with this game there is a lot more strategic depth than simply spread out and don't die (simplified), so you don't need as large of maps
2011-09-26T02:16:08  <janzert> except a bot has to search them out
2011-09-26T02:16:19  <janzert> maybe from a hill to furthest point
2011-09-26T02:17:14  <janzert> at least map design is something I feel we can keep refining through most of the contest
2011-09-26T02:17:20  <McLeopold> so, 500 max distance from any hill to any point?
2011-09-26T02:17:47  <janzert> at the very upper limit
2011-09-26T02:18:09  <McLeopold> then, 250 for hill to hill?
2011-09-26T02:18:55  <janzert> I think those might still feel too far but it would be a start
2011-09-26T02:19:16  <janzert> I guess knowing the values of the various current maps would help
2011-09-26T02:20:02  <McLeopold> for the food cutoff, you would want at least 10% of the map discoverable by 150 turns
2011-09-26T02:20:14  <janzert> e.g. maze 3 still feels too far
2011-09-26T02:20:19  <janzert> but I don't know how far that is
2011-09-26T02:20:44  <janzert> http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=44
2011-09-26T02:21:13  <janzert> leviathan seems to search fairly efficiently but just is getting to the opponent at 1000 turns
2011-09-26T02:21:39  <janzert> certainly not maximally efficient but not terrible
2011-09-26T02:22:34  <eashoka> in case of draws, (players taken same number of hills at the end) shall we break the tie and rank the players according to number of ants they have at the end ? this will prevent players taking defensive stances and just staying put, leading to boring games.
2011-09-26T02:22:42  <McLeopold> yea, it's about 450-475 distance
2011-09-26T02:22:54  <janzert> eashoka: no, I really don't want to do that
2011-09-26T02:23:42  <janzert> so the numbers above might work out fine then
2011-09-26T02:23:45  <McLeopold> no, ties are okay
2011-09-26T02:24:15  <eashoka> reason ? how and why we should say players with 300 ants and 10 ants (both taking 2 hills each) should both be considered as equally performed ?
2011-09-26T02:24:34  <janzert> because the objective is to take hills :)
2011-09-26T02:24:35  <_flag> eashoka: I think the idea is to give people who have been working on the beta for a long time the smallest possible headstart, and if they did that a bot could essentially win by just doing what everyone's already been doing
2011-09-26T02:25:07  <janzert> how many ants you keep alive doesn't really matter at all
2011-09-26T02:25:08  <eashoka> _flag : that sounds logical :-)
2011-09-26T02:25:28  <janzert> how you use them does ;)
2011-09-26T02:29:39  *** onensora <onensora!~c@188.65.161.142> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-26T02:34:55  <eashoka> Another one : why don't we stop games as soon as a winner is determined? say in a map with 4 hills, let's say one player has destroyed 2 hills. 2 hills remaining with 2 remaining players, there is no way now the second player can overtake 1st, for he can at most destroy 1 more ant hill and so never can catch the 1st play in scores. so what if we just stop the game at this point ?
2011-09-26T02:36:15  <janzert> once leviathan learns about destroying hills he's going to be quite a bit better ;)
2011-09-26T02:36:54  <janzert> the plan is to stop games as soon as the ranking of all remaining players can not change
2011-09-26T02:37:01  <janzert> it just hasn't been coded yet
2011-09-26T02:37:52  <janzert> or actually I think that made it into the last big update McLeopold pushed
2011-09-26T02:39:47  <eashoka> jancert : ok, it is all beginning to make sense now :-) one last qsn : should we give any special bonus for a lone survivor ? (in case there is one player who has managed to eliminate all others but little behind in belted hills)
2011-09-26T02:40:49  <janzert> I'd really rather not add any score finagling and I think that situation will be pretty rare
2011-09-26T02:42:13  <janzert> it's like chess the objective there is to checkmate the opponent, all that matters is whether or not you accomplish the objective
2011-09-26T02:42:34  <janzert> the objective here is to destroy enemy hills
2011-09-26T02:42:44  <janzert> the purer that can stay the happier I'll be ;)
2011-09-26T02:43:06  <McLeopold> janzert: what map were initial foods outside traversable area?
2011-09-26T02:44:04  <janzert> hmm, I'd have to look around again and I'm not sure it was actually out of reach before a cutoff or anything but it was around several corners in the opposite direction initially
2011-09-26T02:44:39  <McLeopold> yeah, that's what I'm looking for, so a hill near a long wall
2011-09-26T02:45:24  <janzert> probably maze_2
2011-09-26T02:45:27  <McLeopold> maze_12.map looks good
2011-09-26T02:45:54  <janzert> here's an example http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=134
2011-09-26T02:47:28  <janzert> maze_2 is really bad for it since the hills are at a dead end that takes a long route to get to the other side of

2011-09-26T03:41:01  <janzert> ahh, nevermind it didn't

2011-09-26T03:43:58  <janzert> not really at this point
2011-09-26T03:44:38  <janzert> I could see possibly doing away with giving any points for your own hill
2011-09-26T03:45:38  <janzert> but it really seriously is too late here for me to make any sort of good opinion about it
2011-09-26T03:45:50  <McLeopold> okay, go to bed
2011-09-26T03:46:05  <McLeopold> I will stop tempting you with intellectual conversation

2011-09-26T03:46:16  <McLeopold> so, about my visual basic error...

2011-09-26T03:56:38  <antimatroid> any requests or just as is now but with multiple starting locations per player?
2011-09-26T03:56:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: have you looked at the site, do you know what is happening?
2011-09-26T03:57:09  <antimatroid> i have seen a few comments here and just loaded the first link above
2011-09-26T03:57:12  <antimatroid> otherwise no

2011-09-26T03:57:56  <antimatroid> that's alright
2011-09-26T03:59:22  <antimatroid> the ant hills look awesome :)

2011-09-26T03:59:37  <McLeopold> yeah, it's a different game now
2011-09-26T03:59:59  <antimatroid> is there a page explaining new rules?
2011-09-26T04:00:03  <antimatroid> or want to give me a quick overview? :P
2011-09-26T04:00:05  <McLeopold> not yet
2011-09-26T04:00:13  <McLeopold> that what I wanted to talk about :)
2011-09-26T04:00:22  <McLeopold> the problem description is okay
2011-09-26T04:00:27  <McLeopold> the spec needs to be written
2011-09-26T04:00:44  <McLeopold> score is hills only, 2 points for capture, -1 for loss
2011-09-26T04:00:51  <McLeopold> ants spawn only at hills
2011-09-26T04:01:08  <antimatroid> 2 points for capture of a hill or ant?
2011-09-26T04:01:13  <McLeopold> hill
2011-09-26T04:01:24  <McLeopold> ant counts and kill points are gone
2011-09-26T04:02:33  <antimatroid> so you are trying to take out ant hills and not ants?
2011-09-26T04:02:39  <antimatroid> can you kill enemy ants still?
2011-09-26T04:02:42  <McLeopold>  yes
2011-09-26T04:03:10  <antimatroid> hmmm, this is much cooler, awesome
2011-09-26T04:03:11  <McLeopold> you can kill ants, just like normal, but you only get points for taking out hills
2011-09-26T04:03:55  <antimatroid> what happens if your ant hill is captured?
2011-09-26T04:03:59  <antimatroid> do all your ants get removed from the game?
2011-09-26T04:04:05  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-26T04:04:22  <antimatroid> do you capture it by killing it like any other ant?
2011-09-26T04:04:23  <McLeopold> you can still score a kill
2011-09-26T04:04:34  <McLeopold> no, you must step on it
2011-09-26T04:04:42  <McLeopold> range 0
2011-09-26T04:04:42  <antimatroid> so once your hill is gone you can't spawn any more ants?
2011-09-26T04:04:46  <McLeopold> right
2011-09-26T04:05:02  <antimatroid> and if you collect more than one food item per turn you wait to spawn one ant per turn?
2011-09-26T04:05:09  <antimatroid> until you've spawned all ants waiting to spwn?
2011-09-26T04:05:14  <McLeopold> there is a hive score
2011-09-26T04:05:19  <McLeopold> what some replays
2011-09-26T04:05:24  <McLeopold> you have ants waiting to spawn
2011-09-26T04:05:34  <antimatroid> i will, just trying to make sure my intuition is right :)
2011-09-26T04:05:36  <McLeopold> watch leviathan's games
2011-09-26T04:07:08  <antimatroid> is there a 1 turn delay in an ant spawning?
2011-09-26T04:07:42  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-26T04:07:49  <McLeopold> nice catch :)
2011-09-26T04:07:54  <antimatroid> why is that?
2011-09-26T04:08:04  <McLeopold> you're the first to notice
2011-09-26T04:08:16  <antimatroid> food is automatically harvested if you're adjacent though yeah?
2011-09-26T04:08:23  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-26T04:11:26  <antimatroid> McLeopold: so what's the plan with map files? do you still want multiple starting locations per bot?
2011-09-26T04:11:33  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-26T04:11:49  <McLeopold> maps must produce a 0-9 for the hills
2011-09-26T04:11:52  <antimatroid> is that for multiple hills? and how do you select which hill to spawn to?
2011-09-26T04:12:05  <McLeopold> least recently touched
2011-09-26T04:12:17  <antimatroid> if it's a tie?
2011-09-26T04:12:42  <McLeopold> I expect if bots want to control, they will leave an ant on top of the ones they don't want to spawn at
2011-09-26T04:12:56  <antimatroid> yep fair call
2011-09-26T04:13:11  <antimatroid> i'll try and update the specs and map gen tonight
2011-09-26T04:13:18  <antimatroid> which map gen did you use for the beta maps atm?
2011-09-26T04:13:32  <antimatroid> doesn't look like mine
2011-09-26T04:14:11  <McLeopold> a tie is random :D https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py#L641
2011-09-26T04:14:26  <McLeopold> mapgen.py
2011-09-26T04:14:34  <McLeopold> which is yours

2011-09-26T05:54:57  <Keth> Why not make a scoring based on number of ants left? That would even make sense that largest 'ant colony' wins. And solves the 'suicide-last-minute' problem.

2011-09-26T06:20:06  <GreenTea> Hi!
2011-09-26T06:20:41  <GreenTea> im a little shoked about new rules..
2011-09-26T06:20:55  <GreenTea> This is end variant or possible changes?
2011-09-26T06:21:53  <mcstar> GreenTea: im shocked as well, but i havent read them
2011-09-26T06:22:48  <GreenTea> im too. game specification is old
2011-09-26T06:23:12  <Keth> It's kind of old but you can still find the new changes. Search for "hill" in game specification
2011-09-26T06:23:54  <GreenTea> i think current rules will lead to very long games, to find the winner
2011-09-26T06:24:23  <GreenTea> because now bot need to 1) find enemies in maze
2011-09-26T06:24:54  <Keth> I like the strategical aspects of new game, but I dislike the scoring.
2011-09-26T06:25:12  <Keth> long games don't change much
2011-09-26T06:25:20  <GreenTea> 2) kill them, which can be not so easy in narrow passages
2011-09-26T06:27:20  <GreenTea> Keth: i found "hill" thank you
2011-09-26T06:28:08  <Keth> GreenTea: welcome, keep in mind this will all probably change. Did you get my message?

2011-09-26T07:33:28  <smiley1983> I would expect so - I think it requires version 2.7, unless they changed it
2011-09-26T07:34:20  <patrisk> Yeah, it seems to require 2.7
2011-09-26T07:35:32  <Keth> yes, used to be 2.6, now 2.7 is recommended (I use 2.7.2)
2011-09-26T07:38:19  <patrisk> Is local play broken? When I try to test the sample_bots(Python) they all crash

2011-09-26T07:54:26  <smiley1983> wouldn't that imply resending the whole map each turn though? This way it's only transmitted once
2011-09-26T07:55:52  <antimatroid> oh land is sent once?
2011-09-26T07:55:55  <antimatroid> is that really that helpful?
2011-09-26T07:56:11  <antimatroid> oh wait
2011-09-26T07:56:18  <antimatroid> you get land and water information every turn?
2011-09-26T07:57:31  <smiley1983> I'm not sure if it's being sent yet; but the "problem description" seems to be saying that you get land information just as you get water information
2011-09-26T07:57:42  <smiley1983> which is to say, the first time one of your ants sees it
2011-09-26T07:58:00  <antimatroid> i need to get onto updating the map generator

2011-09-26T08:12:16  <olexs> defending should work fairly implicitly, since ants spawn at the hill, they won't give their terrain up
2011-09-26T08:12:38  <olexs> best defence is a good attack, so first things first.
2011-09-26T08:12:46  <antimatroid> i should still think a good bot is now going to want to actually defend their hill, as without it you can't spawn new ants
2011-09-26T08:13:00  <mleise> antimatroid: Frederick the Great once said "He who defends everything, defends nothing."
2011-09-26T08:13:08  <olexs> does every bot only get one hill?
2011-09-26T08:13:12  <olexs> on any map?
2011-09-26T08:13:15  <antimatroid> no, that's my job tonight
2011-09-26T08:13:25  <antimatroid> to update the map generator so bots start with more than one hill
2011-09-26T08:13:50  <olexs> how's spawning resolved then? closest hill to the collected food item?
2011-09-26T08:14:29  <mleise> olexs: no
2011-09-26T08:14:34  <antimatroid> longest one since it spawned one
2011-09-26T08:14:37  <antimatroid> ties are broken randomly
2011-09-26T08:14:40  <olexs> ok
2011-09-26T08:14:47  <mleise> antimatroid: how do you know?
2011-09-26T08:14:50  <antimatroid> there's a 1 turn delay before you spawn an ant from collecting food too
2011-09-26T08:14:55  <antimatroid> mleise: had a chat to mcleopold before
2011-09-26T08:15:31  <mleise> I hope you like that this is closer to your first proposal
2011-09-26T08:15:39  <antimatroid> and if you have more ants to spawn than ant hills it will just line them up to spawn on future turns
2011-09-26T08:15:47  <antimatroid> melise: i love the changes :D
2011-09-26T08:16:19  <olexs> lining them up works now already, displayed as "hive" in the visualizer, if i'm right
2011-09-26T08:16:25  <antimatroid> yep
2011-09-26T08:16:44  <olexs> keeping a spawn free is important :)
2011-09-26T08:17:12  <antimatroid> if you want to alter where an ant will spawn you can move you ants onto your own hills i believe
2011-09-26T08:17:27  <antimatroid> and to take out an enemy hill you need to be on the hill after battle is resolved
2011-09-26T08:17:39  <antimatroid> mleise: it is after battle yes?
2011-09-26T08:17:54  <smiley1983> is there going to be a line telling you about dead hives, like dead ants?

2011-09-26T08:28:30  <olexs> how exactly does one kill hills? just move an ant next to it or onto it?
2011-09-26T08:29:07  <antimatroid> yep, if you have an ant on an enemy hill you take it out
2011-09-26T08:29:15  <olexs> ok
2011-09-26T08:49:58  <olexs> one-on-one games don't work well. if my bot is vastly superior, he will kill all enemy ants before taking out the hive, and the game will end with 1-1 scores. the bonus doesn't seem to count into ratings, both players are displayed as "1st" in profiles

2011-09-26T09:44:04  <sir_macelon> these changes are really great IMO
2011-09-26T09:44:36  <sir_macelon> there was an obvious lack of a neat macro strategy
2011-09-26T09:44:57  <sir_macelon> and there won't be any stupid suicides in the end!
2011-09-26T09:45:04  <sir_macelon> @monologue
2011-09-26T09:45:04  <contestbot> sir_macelon: Your current monologue is at least 5 lines long.
2011-09-26T09:46:15  <olexs> hills bring the game much closer to "proper" strategy games. one can use many more interesting strategies now
2011-09-26T09:48:56  <sir_macelon> exactly and games will be much better to watch
2011-09-26T09:49:49  <olexs> my bot does surprisingly well on these maze maps... didn't actually expect that
2011-09-26T09:52:42  <olexs> rankings take a while to stabilize with this few bots and the 1-on-1 bug, though
2011-09-26T09:54:45  <sir_macelon> well, mine also does well, although I didn't optimized it on mazes yet and it is hill-blind
2011-09-26T09:55:49  <olexs> I fixed the hill-blindness with simple "kill all hills after battle simulation" order. will work more on that later, hill defence is also quite important
2011-09-26T09:57:20  <sir_macelon> I am still analyzing the games to come up with a good design
2011-09-26T09:57:33  <sir_macelon> but it is really interesting
2011-09-26T09:58:07  <olexs> a possible tactic would be hill diving... just try and get a few ants past defences and take out an enemy hill quickly, without engaging in large battles
2011-09-26T09:58:10  <sir_macelon> defence will get more important if bots will start to send ALL ants on particular hill
2011-09-26T09:58:44  <olexs> my bot should do something similar in certain situations
2011-09-26T09:59:26  <olexs> but for now, I'm afk. Will work more on this in the coming days
2011-09-26T10:00:32  <olexs> wtf xD my bot just got the deciding hill kill on turn 1000: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=373&user=4 that's close...

2011-09-26T12:38:11  <antimatroid> i assume you mean shortest path length?
2011-09-26T12:38:16  <antimatroid> i imagine some kind of a* search?
2011-09-26T12:38:28  <McLeopold> hey, check this out http://harablog.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/jump-point-search/
2011-09-26T12:39:05  <McLeopold> antimatroid: btw, we are going to try and implement a max distance of 250 between hills
2011-09-26T12:39:16  <McLeopold> which is a map gen issue
2011-09-26T12:39:45  <antimatroid> what do you want the minimum starting distance between hills to be?
2011-09-26T12:39:58  <McLeopold> no min
2011-09-26T12:40:10  <McLeopold> symmetry will take care of that
2011-09-26T12:40:11  <antimatroid> you could end up with them adjacent then :P
2011-09-26T12:40:25  <McLeopold> well, ...
2011-09-26T12:40:33  <McLeopold> 20?
2011-09-26T12:40:34  <McLeopold> idk
2011-09-26T12:40:51  <janzert> minimum is probably vision radius + a little :)
2011-09-26T12:40:57  <janzert> working on getting server up btw
2011-09-26T12:41:08  <antimatroid> i can put in a max starting distance, but it wouldn't be based on path distance
2011-09-26T12:41:09  <McLeopold> janzert: but with path finding, as the crow flies can be less
2011-09-26T12:41:26  <janzert> hmm, true
2011-09-26T12:41:37  <antimatroid> i am thinking i'll just add the extra hills in to maps once they're made
2011-09-26T12:41:42  <McLeopold> janzert: I assume you've revived the server?
2011-09-26T12:41:43  <McLeopold> :)

2011-09-26T12:42:21  <McLeopold> I got a nice message in my ssh session that said it was going down NOW
2011-09-26T12:42:53  <janzert> yeah, somehow the spot price shot up to over double the regular instance price
2011-09-26T12:43:04  <McLeopold> how long?
2011-09-26T12:43:08  <McLeopold> is it still there?
2011-09-26T12:43:28  <janzert> it seems to be jumping up and down still in that zone,
2011-09-26T12:43:38  <McLeopold> has it before now, in the last month?
2011-09-26T12:44:06  <McLeopold> can I get the price link?
2011-09-26T12:44:16  <janzert> only other time I know of is in april when amazon had a major outage
2011-09-26T12:44:34  <janzert> but it didn't really matter what you payed then since there just plain weren't any working
2011-09-26T12:46:15  <janzert> unfortunately I don't know of a third part site that shows price by availability zone, which is how amazon breaks it down now, http://cloudexchange.org/charts/us-east-1.linux.m1.large.html has it by region but only shows a peak of 0.34

2011-09-26T13:19:17  <antimatroid> should i perhaps reduce the max dimensions from 150?
2011-09-26T13:19:35  <janzert> some maps are created with too much travel time between the hills
2011-09-26T13:19:53  <UncleVasya> Is it April 1 already? :-)
2011-09-26T13:20:01  <janzert> but the max dimension of a maze map doesn't correspond well with the travel distance
2011-09-26T13:20:14  <janzert> so we want to measure the actual distance directly
2011-09-26T13:20:54  <janzert> for non-maze maps the max dimension correlates fairly well of course
2011-09-26T13:21:13  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2011-09-26T13:21:15  <UncleVasya> This thing with non-expected hills adding seems totally like a joke for April fools day.
2011-09-26T13:21:17  <antimatroid> i have an idea i think
2011-09-26T13:21:19  <janzert> but the current sizes are probably fine
2011-09-26T13:21:37  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: no jokes :)
2011-09-26T13:22:49  <UncleVasya> Have you created a top secret irc channel for discussing it?
2011-09-26T13:23:20  <antimatroid> janzert: hmmm, i don't know how easy it would be, but adding in more hills per player should help the problem?
2011-09-26T13:23:31  <UncleVasya> I'm interested in logs twith talks about hiils making.
2011-09-26T13:23:56  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: it wasn't done here, i didn't know about it until today :P
2011-09-26T13:26:38  <UncleVasya> hmm, I'm surprised with fact that they did not add you to a secret group of hills_makers. Or them was made by only one person?

2011-09-26T13:28:40  <antimatroid> janzert: it's 3:30am, do you think i should push the equivalent of the current version that does multi hills or wait until I do something about the maximum starting distance between hills? :P
2011-09-26T13:29:13  <janzert> my primary motivation for the change was not evening the battlefield but the lack of clarity in objective to the old version, which seemed to me to lead to a game that wasn't terribly 'fun'
2011-09-26T13:29:25  <antimatroid> yeah i totally agree with that

2011-09-26T13:37:26  <UncleVasya> I finally saw what are these "hills". I found it interesting and wanna see and feel the difference with old gameplay. This kind of game seems to be a little easier (just intuitive feeling).
2011-09-26T13:37:32  <antimatroid> @later tell McLeopold I've added multiple hills to the map generator but haven't done anything about the maximum path distance between hills yet, atm I'm thinking maybe adding hills until that distance is below a given maximum?
2011-09-26T13:37:32  <contestbot> antimatroid: Aye, aye, sir
2011-09-26T13:37:55  <antimatroid> maximum min path :P

2011-09-26T13:59:52  <janzert> so it comes between attacking and spawning
2011-09-26T14:02:28  <antimatroid> hmmm, so you can't spawn an ant to save your hill that turn
2011-09-26T14:02:40  <antimatroid> there's also a 1 turn delay in spawning an ant
2011-09-26T14:03:30  <janzert> well if you start at spawn then it's spawn -> orders -> attack -> raze
2011-09-26T14:03:52  <janzert> so if there is an ant on the hill you'll have to kill all the ants in the hill before you'll be able to step onit
2011-09-26T14:03:59  <antimatroid> yeah that's reasonable
2011-09-26T14:04:14  <antimatroid> i'm still not sure why there's a 1 turn delay between harvesting food and spawning an ant?
2011-09-26T14:04:49  <janzert> me neither, I saw you ask but I don't think McLeopold ever explained did he?
2011-09-26T14:05:10  <janzert> my guess is it wasn't purposeful
2011-09-26T14:05:21  <antimatroid> yeah i don't think he ever explained
2011-09-26T14:05:29  <antimatroid> seems like it'll just result in endless questions to me :P
2011-09-26T14:05:35  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm going to get some more sleep before uni
2011-09-26T14:05:49  <janzert> is it really a turn delay?
2011-09-26T14:05:59  <janzert> or just harvest on turn 0 and spawn on turn 1
2011-09-26T14:06:20  <antimatroid> you would expect it to spawn at the start of the following turn, it's a turn after that

2011-09-26T14:10:26  <janzert> spawning activity is where both the food is gathered and the ant spawns on the hill
2011-09-26T14:10:57  <janzert> this happens as the last activity of the turn
2011-09-26T14:11:18  <janzert> if the food is gathered on turn 1 then it spawns an ant on turn 2
2011-09-26T14:11:34  <janzert> if a hill is clear for it to spawn anyway
2011-09-26T14:12:03  <janzert> I think it should work that way and I'm almost positive that is the way it actually works
2011-09-26T14:12:30  <antimatroid> ask mcleopold later, i'm pretty sure it'll spawn on turn 3 atm
2011-09-26T14:12:36  <antimatroid> but i think 2 would be better
2011-09-26T14:12:39  <antimatroid> anyway, sleep :P
2011-09-26T14:12:51  <janzert> but you won't be able to send the new ant an order till turn 3 of course

2011-09-26T15:15:32  <ChrisH> mleise: Since the addition of hives the player focus buttons in the visualizer are just grey for me.
2011-09-26T15:15:54  <janzert> ChrisH: they do look correctly colored here
2011-09-26T15:15:57  <mleise> Oo on the server?
2011-09-26T15:16:30  <mleise> This should only happen locally, when the browsers enforce the web security rules.

2011-09-26T15:16:57  <berak> it can only go down from there..

2011-09-26T15:17:26  <mleise> wtf... I have to check that *g*
2011-09-26T15:17:44  <janzert> mleise: it do see what seems like 'timeout', 'crash' marks in the timeline are getting pushed to the end of the game
2011-09-26T15:17:54  <janzert> e.g. this game http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=383&user=5
2011-09-26T15:18:19  <janzert> that timeout appears to happen around turn 280
2011-09-26T15:18:20  <ChrisH> janzert: yeah, I filed an issue on that one yesterday too.
2011-09-26T15:18:39  <UncleVasya> ChrisH: Do you have the same nick on PlanetWars?
2011-09-26T15:18:53  <ChrisH> UncleVasya: yes
2011-09-26T15:19:18  <mleise> ChrisH: FF 3.6.20, doesn't show any change. Did you recently upgrade FF or are u sure it was the game update?
2011-09-26T15:19:55  <mleise> janzert: The crash/timeout/etc are pushed to the end now, because they are placed at the end of the score list.
2011-09-26T15:20:06  <mleise> Bots used to produce no new scores when they are dead
2011-09-26T15:20:22  <McLeopold> so it is a replay issue?
2011-09-26T15:20:27  <ChrisH> mleise: It used to show colors, and now it doesn't. I have FF 3.6.22, and I can't swear it was the game update, but that's when I noticed it.

2011-09-26T15:23:01  <ChrisH> RE: bot death marks pushed to end:  if you run playgame.py manually it will generate a player death event to stdout mid-game, so that would be a clue that it is a visualizer or game log issue.
2011-09-26T15:23:05  <McLeopold> janzert: should it go down anyway?  negative bonus?
2011-09-26T15:23:40  <janzert> if the hill is destroyed after the bot times out, it has to doesn't it?
2011-09-26T15:23:57  <ChrisH> mleise: colors show in chrome
2011-09-26T15:24:09  <McLeopold> I'm thinking for bots where all the ants are eliminated
2011-09-26T15:24:39  <Blkt> good evening everyone
2011-09-26T15:24:46  <McLeopold> so, elimination, timeout, crash is instant -1 for all hills
2011-09-26T15:24:48  <janzert> or just go to only adding the self hill scores at the end of the game
2011-09-26T15:25:11  <janzert> that still seems the cleanest to me
2011-09-26T15:25:17  <McLeopold> I like the fact that the score history tells you when the events happened
2011-09-26T15:26:31  <janzert> hmm, ok it seems to complicate the engine if you split when the negative score for the hill being destroyed and the postive score for destroying the hill is handed out though
2011-09-26T15:26:43  <McLeopold> it does...
2011-09-26T15:27:04  <McLeopold> but watching your score go down makes more sense
2011-09-26T15:28:07  <McLeopold> mleise: can you figure out another way to detect the bots participation length?
2011-09-26T15:28:09  <UncleVasya> Blkt: hi
2011-09-26T15:28:15  <mleise> Do bots still participate in the game, if they have no ants and no hive storage?
2011-09-26T15:28:44  <mleise> (otherwise they could timeout after they are eliminated for fact)
2011-09-26T15:28:47  <janzert> not really, but their score can still change atm
2011-09-26T15:29:28  <mleise> I currently show when the bot is technically killed by the engine (I think)
2011-09-26T15:30:01  <mleise> I shouldn't show a timeout at the replay position where it just lost all ants
2011-09-26T15:30:05  <ChrisH> berak: yeah, I'm enjoying being in the #1 slot for the little bit of time it will last.  Server crashes are my friend right now.  ;)

2011-09-26T15:40:27  <mleise> McLeopold: first we need to define what the event is. currently it is the reason the bot was removed from the game (survived till end, eliminated, crashed, timeout)
2011-09-26T15:41:06  <mleise> I have to show multiple markers if elimination can happen independently from a timeout or crash

2011-09-26T15:44:18  <ChrisH> berak: it looks like Starwqy timed out in berak turn 278, because his ants stop moving there.
2011-09-26T15:44:33  <berak> you can't win, when you time out ? still it appeard 1st in the rankings list.
2011-09-26T15:44:55  <mleise> you can win if you timeout :)

2011-09-26T15:46:12  <ChrisH> In that game it looks like Clavier gets 4 bonus points for the remaining hives, and gets the #1 spot as a result.
2011-09-26T15:46:34  <berak> if you look at the replay['ranks'], Starwqy won, viszualiser thinks otherwise

2011-09-26T17:12:12  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I know this is small, but would it be possible to get the date/time formats consistent on the user profile page?  Presently bot submissions times are formatted differently from game times.
2011-09-26T17:14:20  <InsaneMalkavian> what does mean "hive"? On replay page. The number of ants ready to be released from hill?
2011-09-26T17:14:51  <janzert> yes, that's what the section is referring to
2011-09-26T17:15:48  <InsaneMalkavian> Can we get this info from game state?
2011-09-26T17:15:50  <ChrisH> speaking of that, are there any plans to provide that number as an input to the bots each turn?

2011-09-26T17:16:33  <janzert> InsaneMalkavian: it would be food gathered - food spawned
2011-09-26T17:16:50  <janzert> I don't believe there is any plan to explicitly send it
2011-09-26T17:17:04  <janzert> err, food gathered - ants spawned
2011-09-26T17:17:34  <InsaneMalkavian> ok, thanks
2011-09-26T17:17:48  <ChrisH> janzert: how does a bot know for sure it gathered any particular food? does it have to resolve conflicted gathering radii itself?
2011-09-26T17:18:39  <janzert> yes, I believe so
2011-09-26T17:19:31  <ChrisH> likewise, it would need to keep track of whether an ant on top of a hill was new or one that existed on the prior turn (maybe moved on or off the hive)

2011-09-26T17:27:12  <janzert> it seems your heightmap.py commit in august of "don't remember what changed" broke it
2011-09-26T17:27:16  <janzert> :}
2011-09-26T17:27:33  <McLeopold> :) yeah, I was in the middle of stuff
2011-09-26T17:28:07  <McLeopold> height map is slow, due to lots of bad maps
2011-09-26T17:28:35  <janzert> that commit was almost certainly conflicting with engine.py not the mapgen stuff
2011-09-26T17:28:51  <McLeopold> no, it was map.py
2011-09-26T17:28:56  <McLeopold> no biggy
2011-09-26T17:29:47  <McLeopold> git stash worked nicely
2011-09-26T17:30:04  <janzert> ahh, so your change is still uncommited
2011-09-26T17:30:22  <McLeopold> janzert: so, I need to give a hive status at the beginning of the turn?
2011-09-26T17:30:34  <janzert> do we?
2011-09-26T17:30:55  <janzert> it would make bot authors lives easier
2011-09-26T17:31:08  <janzert> but is information that they can calculate if they really want it
2011-09-26T17:31:30  <janzert> just the calculation is a tad complex
2011-09-26T17:31:52  <janzert> I don't have an opinion either way
2011-09-26T17:32:26  <McLeopold> I'd say yes, I know jeff wants stuff to be easy

2011-09-26T17:33:35  <McLeopold> the cutoff logic?
2011-09-26T17:33:36  <janzert> http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=416&user=5 should have ended about twice as fast as it did
2011-09-26T17:33:47  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-26T17:33:47  <janzert> it seems to be broken yes
2011-09-26T17:33:48  <McLeopold> hm..
2011-09-26T17:33:54  <janzert> there are a bunch of examples
2011-09-26T17:33:57  <McLeopold> bad uri :)
2011-09-26T17:34:09  <McLeopold> can we add them to a github issue?
2011-09-26T17:34:43  <janzert> I could start doing that, or I can work on fixing them if you want
2011-09-26T17:35:44  <McLeopold> so, is it just games where one ant had 90 percent for 150?
2011-09-26T17:36:18  <janzert> no, I didn't even mean for that to apply on that one
2011-09-26T17:36:36  <janzert> at turn ~253 the opponents hill is captured
2011-09-26T17:37:03  <janzert> at that point the rankings cannot change and there is only one ant with a hill left
2011-09-26T17:37:18  <janzert> either one should have triggered the game end I think

2011-09-26T17:42:48  <janzert> you sure the current heightmap will ever generate a valid map? :P I added a print to show how much area was added when it throws out a map for too much added area. The lowest I've seen is 13% and the cutoff is set at 2%.
2011-09-26T17:48:46  <McLeopold> janzert: i think it was 1 in 3 that were good, but I can't remember how it ended
2011-09-26T17:49:12  <McLeopold> don't use it, I had to hand pick the ones for beta as it was
2011-09-26T17:50:14  <janzert> well, I've watched it try to generate a map for about 10-20 minutes and it's generating them at a rate of about 1 every 5 seconds or so and has yet to get one
2011-09-26T17:50:32  <janzert> I mean it doesn't even ever output a map
2011-09-26T17:50:38  <janzert> it justs throws them all out
2011-09-26T17:51:23  <janzert> I'm surprised I haven't hit a stack depth limit, since it is a recursive call to generate each time it throws one out ;)

2011-09-26T19:12:17  <ChrisH> yeah, i've got three in my profile.
2011-09-26T19:12:20  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, like this one: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=481&user=5&turn=0
2011-09-26T19:12:21  <janzert> that seemed to be before the worker was restarted, but yes I think it's related
2011-09-26T19:12:52  <McLeopold> janzert: that fix should probably be applied in 2 other places
2011-09-26T19:13:47  <xathis> hey guys, i was thining about strategies for multiple hills per player and i might have discovered a flaw
2011-09-26T19:13:53  <xathis> imagine i get control of an enemy hill but instead of stepping on it i just place two of my ants in attack radius of the hill. so now every other ant my enemy spawns will be directly killed and he has no chance of preventing this. as soon as other enemies approach or the turn limit is over i can still step on the hill and get the points
2011-09-26T19:14:33  <xathis> what's your opinion on this?
2011-09-26T19:14:41  <janzert> play_one_game seems to run the game but visualizer then displays an error
2011-09-26T19:14:56  <olexs> McLeopold: see ny last 3 games, http://antsbeta.janzert.com/profile.php?user=4
2011-09-26T19:15:05  <amstan> xathis: i think the ants should create a stockpile of ants in the hill to be able to defend it
2011-09-26T19:15:16  <olexs> all new maps, all finished directly at start. no game played since, that was a while ago
2011-09-26T19:16:02  <xathis> amstan: but there can only spawn one ant per turn and it would be killed
2011-09-26T19:21:40  <antimatroid> morning
2011-09-26T19:24:14  <xathis> McLeopold, janzert: what do you think about the flaw?
2011-09-26T19:25:11  <antimatroid> xathis: why wouldn't you just take the ant hill out already?
2011-09-26T19:25:16  <antimatroid> oh wait, yeah hmmm
2011-09-26T19:25:27  <janzert> put it in your bot and see how it works out
2011-09-26T19:25:42  <janzert> I'm ambivalent about multiple hills anyway
2011-09-26T19:26:41  <xathis> i'd love to see multiple hills but i'm sure this idea catches on and than we need a different implementation
2011-09-26T19:27:10  <xathis> something like being able to sacriface a hill or directly controlling where you want to spawn
2011-09-26T19:28:28  <antimatroid> McLeopold: have any games run with multiple hills yet?
2011-09-26T19:28:40  <janzert> not successfully
2011-09-26T19:28:57  <janzert> I think he's working on it now
2011-09-26T19:30:13  <antimatroid> hmmm, i just thought of something that does need to change
2011-09-26T19:30:36  <antimatroid> i don't think i ever checked to make sure i'm not adding the additional hills where they'd be completely surrounded by water
2011-09-26T19:31:59  <xathis> i thought there couldn't be a land completely surrounded by water at all?
2011-09-26T19:32:56  <ChrisH> I wonder how a map with two islands separated from each other but both having hives from all players on them would play.
2011-09-26T19:33:01  <antimatroid> no, but it's not checking to make sure what the type of squares are it's adding hills too, it could add them on top of hills
2011-09-26T19:33:06  <antimatroid> i have a 2 line fix
2011-09-26T19:33:28  <xathis> ah okay
2011-09-26T19:36:32  <McLeopold> xathis: the idea was to allow the bot to control where to spawn, I tried to do that without changing the bot output
2011-09-26T19:37:20  <janzert> McLeopold: find the problem with games yet?

2011-09-26T19:38:01  <janzert> oh, guess I better get back to trying to figure it out
2011-09-26T19:41:15  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what do you think about the idea of adding ant hills for players until the maximum minimum path between enemy ant hills is below a specified maximum?
2011-09-26T19:41:21  <antimatroid> i can't really think of how else you'd do it nicely
2011-09-26T19:41:53  <McLeopold> antimatroid: how ever you want to do it
2011-09-26T19:41:59  <janzert> antimatroid: knock down walls in between them?
2011-09-26T19:42:22  <antimatroid> janzert: yeah, that's probably harder though still :P
2011-09-26T19:42:30  <antimatroid> but would allow you to pick how many hills to have better
2011-09-26T19:42:52  <antimatroid> i'll think about it today, i have to leave for uni in a bit anyway
2011-09-26T19:45:23  <ChrisH> janzert: I get an error trying to run the visualizer locally after playing a game on a regular (single hive) maze map. Not sure if that helps, but it sounded like the new maps might have been suspected, but they may not be the direct cause.
2011-09-26T19:45:55  <janzert> yeah, I'm not sure the new maps are actually causing any problem at all. certainly not the only problem
2011-09-26T19:47:20  <antimatroid> http://ants.zeroviz.us/iC3TC/
2011-09-26T19:47:32  <antimatroid> they can look a bit weird with 8 player rotational symmetry
2011-09-26T19:48:56  <antimatroid> http://ants.zeroviz.us/cWckw/ not sure if that many hills is a good idea?
2011-09-26T19:49:17  <ChrisH> antimatroid: not so weird once you translate it to put one of the rotation points in the center
2011-09-26T19:49:42  <antimatroid> ChrisH: I randomly translate the rotationally symmetric grids so that it's harder to determine the type of symmetry :)
2011-09-26T19:50:01  <McLeopold> janzert: the visualizer is complaining about game durations
2011-09-26T19:50:01  <ChrisH> antimatroid: understood
2011-09-26T19:50:01  <antimatroid> i guess i could just get it to try and translate the most ants into the center of the map somehow
2011-09-26T19:50:52  <McLeopold> this is a visualizer/replay issue
2011-09-26T19:51:31  <antimatroid> umm, is that last map i posted fully connected?
2011-09-26T19:52:14  <antimatroid> yeah it is, but i think there's 2 regions pretty well separated
2011-09-26T19:52:26  <janzert> McLeopold: seems to be lines 1373 and 1374 in ants.py where scores are added to the score_history in finish_game

2011-09-26T19:59:39  <janzert> yeah, me too locally
2011-09-26T19:59:48  <janzert> the worker seems to have something else going on
2011-09-26T19:59:53  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-26T20:00:00  <McLeopold> you got a screen session?
2011-09-26T20:00:08  <janzert> there's no error displayed
2011-09-26T20:00:21  <McLeopold> you can stop it and run with --debug
2011-09-26T20:00:23  <janzert> but yeah, I'm playing in a screen now
2011-09-26T20:00:42  <McLeopold> what's the ip?
2011-09-26T20:01:20  <janzert> 184.73.47.209
2011-09-26T20:02:04  <janzert> ugh, max_turns is set to 30
2011-09-26T20:02:08  <janzert> there's one problem
2011-09-26T20:02:24  <McLeopold> oh, I know what happened
2011-09-26T20:02:36  <McLeopold> you used add_maps..., but didn't update the max_turns?
2011-09-26T20:02:45  <janzert> yep, just saw that
2011-09-26T20:02:48  <McLeopold> the default value is 0 :)
2011-09-26T20:03:38  <McLeopold> on the bright side, 100 games will go quick so you know to up the turns :P
2011-09-26T20:03:45  <janzert> heh
2011-09-26T20:04:00  <McLeopold> okay, I'm out until 6
2011-09-26T20:04:10  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@barracuda.imagesourceinc.com> has left #aichallenge
2011-09-26T20:06:39  <janzert> there we go
2011-09-26T20:08:47  <ChrisH> multi_maze_20 is a wild wild west map
2011-09-26T20:09:44  <olexs> it seems there are spawns on water in it
2011-09-26T20:09:56  <olexs> hills
2011-09-26T20:10:53  <janzert> well I think by definition in the map a hill is land, it could be in the midst of water though
2011-09-26T20:11:03  <janzert> since these were generated before antimatroid last fix
2011-09-26T20:11:51  <ChrisH> yeah, it doesn't seem to affect proper movement.
2011-09-26T20:12:30  <olexs> question: will turn_time now stay at 500ms or will it be turned back up to 1s when we go live?
2011-09-26T20:12:44  <janzert> it's probably going to stay at 500
2011-09-26T20:14:44  <olexs> ok
2011-09-26T20:15:55  <antimatroid> amstan: I'm going to be at uni, but I don't think i'm really needed anyway
2011-09-26T20:16:11  <amstan> antimatroid: just letting you know
2011-09-26T20:16:16  <antimatroid> yep
2011-09-26T20:16:17  <amstan> antimatroid: but you're right
2011-09-26T20:16:17  <mleise> amstan: what did you want to tell me and antimatroid? I'm going to bed now.
2011-09-26T20:16:28  <antimatroid> ouch on the 500ms
2011-09-26T20:16:41  <amstan> mleise: if you're interested in participating in a meeting about the launch
2011-09-26T20:16:58  <amstan> mleise: i don't think we need you, but you might like to take part
2011-09-26T20:18:18  <mleise> That's ok for me if you do it in a small group. You may get done more with less opinions ;)
2011-09-26T20:19:39  <amstan> ok
2011-09-26T20:20:58  <mleise> I'll look at something McLeopold added to get the bot status markers right, tomorrow and fix some bugs or get some minor enhancements into the visualizer.
2011-09-26T20:21:54  <mleise> And then I'm through with organizing the ant contest. :)
2011-09-26T20:22:41  <mleise> antimatroid: You use C++, right? Then you should be happy about the advantage of a narrow time window for your turn.
2011-09-26T20:23:25  <antimatroid> mleise: i'm more interested in people being able to implement cooler strategies, but it's always got to be limited somewhere i suppose
2011-09-26T20:23:29  <mleise> Imagine someone using a garbage collected language where the GC kicks in, in the middle of a turn calculation ;)
2011-09-26T20:25:47  <antimatroid> hehe, "if java had real garbage collection it would delete most programs upon execution" my new favourite quote
2011-09-26T20:27:37  <mleise> that's great, anyway gtg!

2011-09-26T21:05:12  <janzert> McLeopold: was trying to put together a quick games page, but I have the same error the map page used to have http://antsbeta.janzert.com/games.php
2011-09-26T21:05:27  <janzert> only one player name is shown in all spots
2011-09-26T21:05:32  * amstan doesn't see jeff anywhere
2011-09-26T21:05:39  <amstan> like gtalk
2011-09-26T21:06:32  <janzert> I'm basically just calling get_game_list_table($page)
2011-09-26T21:07:20  <McLeopold> janzert: redoing game_list.php is on my todo list for this week
2011-09-26T21:07:47  <janzert> ok
2011-09-26T21:07:47  <McLeopold> you should be able to pass in nulls for the criteria and a page 1 to get the first 100 results
2011-09-26T21:08:14  <janzert> yeah, pretty sure they all default to NULL
2011-09-26T21:08:17  <McLeopold> but...I may need to switch to the "select_map_game_list" query to prevent dups
2011-09-26T21:09:07  <McLeopold> amstan: so, did you ever get a response from jeff?  didn't he send out an email to someone?
2011-09-26T21:09:22  <amstan> McLeopold: i did not get a response
2011-09-26T21:09:32  <McLeopold> can you text him now?

2011-09-26T21:11:05  <janzert> I'd like to link the games page right below the visualizer on the frontpage but I'll wait till it's working correctly
2011-09-26T21:11:18  <McLeopold> try that?
2011-09-26T21:11:24  <janzert> heh, that was quick :)
2011-09-26T21:11:33  <janzert> yay
2011-09-26T21:13:31  <olexs> order of maps played doesn't look very random, triple repeats all the time in the last games?
2011-09-26T21:13:51  <McLeopold> olexs: you're right, I haven't looked at that in months
2011-09-26T21:13:54  <janzert> shouldn't this game have ended at move 260? http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=522
2011-09-26T21:14:13  <janzert> i.e. as soon as only one player had a hill left?
2011-09-26T21:14:51  <McLeopold> the scores are wrong for multiple hills, I see negative numbers
2011-09-26T21:14:58  <jbroman> Woah, you can seal hills?
2011-09-26T21:15:20  <olexs> jbroman: you pretty much must, that's the only thing you get points for anymore :)
2011-09-26T21:15:20  <janzert> no, but you can start with more than 1
2011-09-26T21:15:42  <janzert> ok, depends on what you mean by steal :)
2011-09-26T21:15:50  <olexs> seal != steal :)
2011-09-26T21:16:16  <janzert> heh
2011-09-26T21:17:56  <olexs> the scoring system is not perfect, imo. in that game (522 linked above) red had the only hill left, but since blue got all the hill kills, he gets a higher score. even though red would have eventually taken blue out, having the only hill left on the map
2011-09-26T21:18:53  <janzert> blue did better than red, even if red would eventually wipe him out
2011-09-26T21:19:07  <janzert> the objective is not to survive
2011-09-26T21:19:19  <janzert> the objective is to destroy hills :)
2011-09-26T21:19:46  <olexs> I see.
2011-09-26T21:19:59  <janzert> surviving generally helps though :P
2011-09-26T21:20:07  <olexs> true :)
2011-09-26T21:20:55  <olexs> I need to implement some explicit hill defence, I fear on open maps my bot won't be as good as in the mazes
2011-09-26T21:21:13  <ChrisH> You and me both olexs.
2011-09-26T21:21:39  <janzert> reminds me, I think I'll go make that completely open map
2011-09-26T21:21:55  <olexs> no water at all? :)
2011-09-26T21:21:56  <McLeopold> game 522 should have ended sooner
2011-09-26T21:22:06  <janzert> olexs: right
2011-09-26T21:22:13  <olexs> janzert: interesting
2011-09-26T21:22:23  <janzert> just to see what it looks like
2011-09-26T21:22:29  <janzert> plays like
2011-09-26T21:22:56  <olexs> no terrain advantages, only formations against formations
2011-09-26T21:25:51  * amstan just saw jeff login to gmail

2011-09-26T21:31:44  <j3camero> That's convenient.
2011-09-26T21:31:44  <janzert> hey
2011-09-26T21:31:48  <j3camero> Hey hey.
2011-09-26T21:32:00  <j3camero> Can't stay long. Gotta get up early for teh work tomorrow.
2011-09-26T21:32:25  <janzert> before we launch we need to know if money's and permissions are in place to do so
2011-09-26T21:32:31  <amstan> j3camero: so, we can launch soon, we have an amazon server going, ready for domain redirection
2011-09-26T21:32:50  <j3camero> Sweet.
2011-09-26T21:33:08  *** ibdknox_ <ibdknox_!~ibdknox@70-36-146-56.dsl.dynamic.sonic.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2011-09-26T21:33:14  <janzert> the way I'd like to host the main server would cost ~$250 US if the money is there for it
2011-09-26T21:33:14  <amstan> j3camero: if you still want to do that non profit stuff, here's my idea
2011-09-26T21:33:21  <janzert> per month
2011-09-26T21:33:46  <amstan> j3camero: we could meet next weekend at your place, and get the directors thing going, if jbroman wants to
2011-09-26T21:33:54  <amstan> j3camero: maybe have a little launch party
2011-09-26T21:34:03  <j3camero> Hmm this sounds intriguing.
2011-09-26T21:34:06  <jbroman> I don't believe I'm sufficiently involved at this point to make an appropriate director.
2011-09-26T21:34:11  <j3camero> Meeting in RL, hehe.
2011-09-26T21:34:47  <jbroman> Also my being a current Google employee may complicate things.
2011-09-26T21:34:57  <amstan> jbroman: darn
2011-09-26T21:35:03  <amstan> jbroman: but we need 3!
2011-09-26T21:35:06  <jbroman> Also, gathering people from Waterloo, Hamilton and Toronto for a meeting seems impractical. :P
2011-09-26T21:35:11  <j3camero> At this point I think what I will do is instead of tackling the creation of a non profit, it we'll just operate it the same way as in the past and home for no personal income tax issues.
2011-09-26T21:35:32  <amstan> i don't mind coming over for that one time
2011-09-26T21:35:46  <amstan> ok, sounds good then
2011-09-26T21:37:28  <amstan> j3camero: k, so money? we interrupted janzert
2011-09-26T21:37:31  <j3camero> Okay, so what do we need... we need money, and permission to use Google's name again. I can advance both these things tomorrow. I will prepare a package to send to the relevant folks at Google and send it. To ensure that I actually do this, I also promise to send said package to the ai contest mailing list. So you'll know when it's been sent.
2011-09-26T21:38:02  <janzert> great :)
2011-09-26T21:38:12  <McLeopold> we want to launch Sunday
2011-09-26T21:38:24  <janzert> shhh :P
2011-09-26T21:38:25  <McLeopold> in 6 days
2011-09-26T21:38:57  <McLeopold> well, anyday but sunday, i mean
2011-09-26T21:39:22  <janzert> hehe
2011-09-26T21:39:49  <McLeopold> j3camero: can you get that stuff done by Friday?
2011-09-26T21:41:54  <j3camero> I will get it in the mail tomorrow.
2011-09-26T21:42:12  <McLeopold> j3camero: do you know how long it will take to get permission?
2011-09-26T21:42:14  <j3camero> We will see how long it takes to get someone at Google to carry out the concrete steps that it takes to secure funding.
2011-09-26T21:42:27  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-26T21:42:29  <j3camero> The permission should be quicker.
2011-09-26T21:42:39  <McLeopold> so then, we launch when you say go?
2011-09-26T21:43:00  <j3camero> I don't imagine them having a problem with the event, given how smoothly and professionally its been in the past.
2011-09-26T21:43:16  <janzert> also I  would like to run the contest up to christmas break for north american uni's
2011-09-26T21:43:42  <j3camero> That sounds good to me.
2011-09-26T21:43:42  <McLeopold> about 3 months?
2011-09-26T21:43:48  <McLeopold> I like it
2011-09-26T21:43:50  * amstan can just see the ammount of people we're going to make miserable because they must code bots
2011-09-26T21:43:54  <j3camero> That will give lots of people a chance to take part.
2011-09-26T21:44:01  <janzert> which means closing the open portion around the 12th of december and running finals for most or all of that week
2011-09-26T21:44:01  <amstan> especially near xmas
2011-09-26T21:44:12  <janzert> 2.5 months about
2011-09-26T21:44:43  <j3camero> Is there an instance of the site running in a staging area somewhere?
2011-09-26T21:44:48  <janzert> then they can all brag about their results when they're home on break :P
2011-09-26T21:44:50  <j3camero> Or someone have a decent dev instance up
2011-09-26T21:45:02  <janzert> @beta
2011-09-26T21:45:03  <contestbot> janzert: beta could be http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/.
2011-09-26T21:45:25  <j3camero> Can I get an account for that?
2011-09-26T21:45:40  <amstan> j3camero: go ahead
2011-09-26T21:45:43  <j3camero> Or do I just make one
2011-09-26T21:45:43  <amstan> j3camero: or you mean ssh?
2011-09-26T21:45:44  <j3camero> Nice.
2011-09-26T21:45:49  <j3camero> Nope just web account.
2011-09-26T21:46:11  <janzert> we made a semi-major change to the game yesterday, so the people that have been participating for 4+ months of beta shouldn't be too advantaged either :)
2011-09-26T21:46:18  <amstan> janzert, McLeopold: you guys want to release that server as is, with no more mods, right?
2011-09-26T21:46:25  <janzert> the objective now is to destroy the most hills
2011-09-26T21:46:34  <janzert> hmm?
2011-09-26T21:46:35  <McLeopold> amstan: not quite sure what you mean
2011-09-26T21:46:44  <amstan> McLeopold: without any more account resets
2011-09-26T21:46:55  <janzert> no, planning on doing a reset at launch
2011-09-26T21:47:00  <j3camero> Oh man... this account creation system... all written by hand in PHP...
2011-09-26T21:47:00  <amstan> again? ok
2011-09-26T21:47:00  <McLeopold> ^^
2011-09-26T21:47:02  <janzert> probably build a new server
2011-09-26T21:47:37  <amstan> j3camero: if i had known we were to take 8 monts to release epsilon i would have been more persistent with django
2011-09-26T21:49:57  <McLeopold> so, is there anymore agenda items?
2011-09-26T21:50:10  <amstan> j3camero: party?
2011-09-26T21:50:23  <j3camero> Amstan I would have a launch party with you.
2011-09-26T21:50:24  <janzert> not that I can think that we need j3camero for offhand
2011-09-26T21:50:45  <j3camero> I am just poking at the website.
2011-09-26T21:50:50  <amstan> j3camero: i can also get computerwiz_222(site designer) in that
2011-09-26T21:51:24  <j3camero> Just submitted a starter package. However I'm not seeing much feedback on where its at.
2011-09-26T21:51:30  <j3camero> Are there game servers running?
2011-09-26T21:51:36  <amstan> they should be
2011-09-26T21:51:48  <olexs> http://antsbeta.janzert.com/server_stats.php doesn't look like it

2011-09-26T21:52:01  <janzert> uh oh, looks like ec2 shut it down
2011-09-26T21:52:04  <olexs> no games per minute, no workers registered
2011-09-26T21:52:20  <j3camero> Okay I have one more agenda item.
2011-09-26T21:52:33  <janzert> spot price must have spiked
2011-09-26T21:52:38  <McLeopold> janzert: so, should we decide on using a server that will always be up
2011-09-26T21:52:48  <janzert> well, the main server yes
2011-09-26T21:52:54  <j3camero> As power users, we tend to focus a lot on tools, rules, specs, and the like. One thing that is an absolute prerequisite that we dont seem to have is decent tutorials.
2011-09-26T21:52:56  *** aarossig <aarossig!~andrew@216-246-252-177.cpe.distributel.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-26T21:53:27  <McLeopold> j3camero: My goal this week is to write easy to read tutorials
2011-09-26T21:53:31  <janzert> McLeopold: which the main server should be now
2011-09-26T21:53:47  <McLeopold> I know a few others on irc will help vet out the tough stuff
2011-09-26T21:54:10  <j3camero> The standard in the past has been "a high school student with no programming experience should be able to submit a bot and improve it to some degree". I don't know if we'll get there given that this contest has more involved rules. But we need at least tutorials about how to submit a bot and climb the rankings.
2011-09-26T21:54:12  <janzert> we could run one worker like that too, but then we could normally run 3 workers for the same price
2011-09-26T21:54:17  <McLeopold> http://antsbeta.janzert.com/problem_description.php if you look at this page, you can see we will be able to put diagrams and sample games into the spec pages
2011-09-26T21:54:25  <janzert> so I think the occasional, all workers go down is worth it
2011-09-26T21:54:39  <j3camero> good idea McLeopold.
2011-09-26T21:55:29  <j3camero> But yeah we can't talk about launch until we produce an extremely low-attrition process for transforming casual web surfers into contestants. Tutorials are a huge part of that.
2011-09-26T21:55:44  <McLeopold> ok, good to know
2011-09-26T21:55:52  <j3camero> Well actually I would be happy with just a few tutorials.
2011-09-26T21:56:09  <McLeopold> do you care which language?
2011-09-26T21:56:48  <j3camero> I would insist on C++, Java, Python, or C#. But I can see that its possible to do an amazing job with other languages.
2011-09-26T21:57:00  <j3camero> I single out those four because they are by far the most popular.
2011-09-26T21:57:01  <McLeopold> 4 tutorials?
2011-09-26T21:57:04  <olexs> if I may, I'd have another point. not all starter bots are yet upgraded to support hills, using ones that don't (like Java) might be a lot harder on newcomers
2011-09-26T21:57:18  <j3camero> Not 4 tutorials. Just any one of those languages. Since almost any programmer can read them with ease.
2011-09-26T21:58:35  <janzert> olexs: it should be pretty easy for someone to do those updates though, I'm hoping we'll get most all of them this week from contributors
2011-09-26T21:58:43  <janzert> and even the non-updated ones will still run
2011-09-26T21:59:02  <janzert> it just won't be as easy for a beginner to make progress with them
2011-09-26T21:59:09  <j3camero> Okay who wants to pick a launch date? Let's pick a date in two weeks ish and just launch this thang.
2011-09-26T21:59:29  <j3camero> Google-branded or not. Google-funded or not.
2011-09-26T21:59:42  <McLeopold> Oct 2
2011-09-26T21:59:44  <McLeopold> :)
2011-09-26T21:59:44  <j3camero> Even without Google funding I believe it's possible to run this thing on a shoestring budget.
2011-09-26T21:59:47  <aarossig> j3camero: what is the connection that we have with google? I have always been curious.
2011-09-26T21:59:51  <janzert> well, we need funding of some sort
2011-09-26T21:59:58  <amstan> yeah, idea was for Oct 2
2011-09-26T22:00:01  <janzert> it's a little too much for me to fund myself ;)
2011-09-26T22:00:28  <j3camero> Yeah it would be steep.
2011-09-26T22:00:36  <aarossig> Oct 2 would be cool, I want to put the web design on my resume for some co-op interviews :P
2011-09-26T22:00:36  <janzert> I can fund the beta server myself for another week or two but beyond that I can't keep it up
2011-09-26T22:00:41  <McLeopold> j3camero: how do you feel about selling ad space?
2011-09-26T22:00:41  <j3camero> What did we say the game servers would be? Like $600/mth for three?
2011-09-26T22:01:21  <amstan> since we're on ads, apparently reddit offers free ads for not for profit things, maybe we can get a bunch on r/programming
2011-09-26T22:01:33  <aarossig> if the worker is portable, is it possible to donate CPU time? does this violate some kind of rule for the contest?
2011-09-26T22:01:51  <amstan> aarossig: the workers should be uniform
2011-09-26T22:01:54  <janzert> workers are ~$125 per and the main server ~$250
2011-09-26T22:02:01  <olexs> I'll write an article about the contest on a big russian IT blog. The planetwars challenge was pretty popular there.
2011-09-26T22:02:07  <aarossig> amstan: can we get some help from school maybe?
2011-09-26T22:02:09  <j3camero> aarossig: I would love to be able to take you up on that. Really. But there's enough people who feel that the workers must be very fair and even.
2011-09-26T22:02:19  <McLeopold> olexs: wait for amstan to do that
2011-09-26T22:02:43  <amstan> McLeopold: do what?
2011-09-26T22:02:49  <McLeopold> make anouncements
2011-09-26T22:02:53  <olexs> mcleopold: I'm not publishing anything before you launch :)
2011-09-26T22:02:59  <aarossig> j3camero: understabdable, i had considered the issues associated with using varying systems -- it would be near impossible to benchmark the system to give an accurate time per move that is proportional to available CPU power
2011-09-26T22:03:18  <amstan> olexs: you can write it and i'll give you a ping when we're launching
2011-09-26T22:03:29  <olexs> amstan: that'd be great.
2011-09-26T22:03:43  <j3camero> janzert: supposing that the costs of the contest are somewhere in the range of under $1000/mth, I think that we can go ahead no matter what. That is, we could say its a go right here right now without any further information.
2011-09-26T22:03:48  <janzert> worker is back, btw
2011-09-26T22:04:05  <aarossig> j3camero: what if we get one of those gay paypal donate buttons lol
2011-09-26T22:04:08  <McLeopold> aarossig: on a side note, we need the top header to be shrunk quite a bit
2011-09-26T22:04:12  <janzert> ok, yes I can keep it less than that for sure
2011-09-26T22:04:38  <j3camero> Between funding it out of my own pocket and dealing 1 on 1 with the odd person who wants to pitch $100, it shoudl be manageable. I'm just saying this as last-resort kind of thinging. That is, we can pick a launch date now even though we dont yet know how the Google funding will be.
2011-09-26T22:04:58  <aarossig> we might come across someone who cares about the contest and donates some money to help us out
2011-09-26T22:05:19  <amstan> j3camero: we still need permission otherwise we'll have to grep for "Google" and remove
2011-09-26T22:05:27  <j3camero> Yes for sure.
2011-09-26T22:05:35  <janzert> then let's launch next Sunday evening
2011-09-26T22:05:43  <aarossig> can someone enlighten me on the Google situation?
2011-09-26T22:05:57  <McLeopold> aarossig: they are big and in control of EVERYTHING
2011-09-26T22:05:57  <j3camero> Permission to use the same brand as we have in the past is unlikely to be an issue. But yes I do need to get the formal OK for that.
2011-09-26T22:06:01  <janzert> oh, that's what we need j3camero for :)
2011-09-26T22:06:22  <janzert> we'll need you around to do the dns change at that point
2011-09-26T22:06:26  <aarossig> got it, I thought there was some kind of rumor that google would not allow us to continue using the branding
2011-09-26T22:06:43  <amstan> aarossig: no, it's just that we have to ping them every time
2011-09-26T22:06:47  <aarossig> great
2011-09-26T22:06:59  <j3camero> aarossig: the contest was originally created by the Computer Science Club at Waterloo. Many of the members there have interned at Google including myself and jbroman. So they have pitched us a small bit of money in the past to run the contest servers.
2011-09-26T22:07:20  <aarossig> j3camero: very cool -- I am understanding now
2011-09-26T22:07:37  <janzert> I can start bringing the final server up around 6pm EST and it will most likely be ready to go by 9pm at the latest
2011-09-26T22:08:24  <aarossig> I would love to get a visualizer for web traffic that runs in a terminal -- once the contest is launched we can watch the traffic roll in (something prettier than tail -f access.log)
2011-09-26T22:08:36  <j3camero> janzert: speaking of what we need j3camero for. Past experience has shown that in year since I started working full time, I have been a terrible day to day manager of this project. This I regret, since I really love the project. Since I want to see it succeed once again, I propose it might be wise to appoint someone else to run it day to day. Someone who can make key decisions in my absense. Just so I don't sink it by being absent for a
2011-09-26T22:09:20  <janzert> well, we've been able to work most everything out between amstan, McLeopold and myself since June
2011-09-26T22:09:29  <j3camero> Awesome.
2011-09-26T22:09:41  <amstan> j3camero: except the parts where money or domain jiggling is required
2011-09-26T22:09:52  <amstan> that's why we couldn't launch on our own
2011-09-26T22:09:57  <amstan> and google permissions*
2011-09-26T22:09:58  <janzert> the only things we can't do are the money, name issues and dns
2011-09-26T22:10:00  <j3camero> Right right.
2011-09-26T22:10:50  <aarossig> amstan: I would like to see that task split to two people so that any issus that arise don't have to be put in on a list until they are available
2011-09-26T22:11:12  <amstan> aarossig: it's 3 ppl so there's no split votes
2011-09-26T22:11:14  <janzert> look at that j3camero bottom of the rankings :P
2011-09-26T22:11:17  <aarossig> or worse... something happens and they are simply unable to work on the contest at all -- yeah
2011-09-26T22:11:25  <j3camero> haha my bot sucks
2011-09-26T22:11:26  <amstan> lol! j3camero is the dumbest bot
2011-09-26T22:11:43  <j3camero> Wow I can't believe Reddit hasn't found this beta site. There are people who would kill for another Google AI Challenge.
2011-09-26T22:11:48  <aarossig> lol
2011-09-26T22:12:05  <amstan> j3camero: our github got reddited 2 months ago
2011-09-26T22:12:15  <janzert> well we had over 400 active accounts before the reset yesterady
2011-09-26T22:12:15  <amstan> j3camero: got a bunch of ppl on irc and stuff
2011-09-26T22:12:22  <McLeopold> you know who has? baiduspider
2011-09-26T22:12:22  <j3camero> Haha nice nice.
2011-09-26T22:12:27  <janzert> and I think the game is much more interesting now :)
2011-09-26T22:12:41  <amstan> oh yeah.. and such a crappy server we had, it was only $7/month
2011-09-26T22:12:47  <aarossig> amstan: hey, it worked
2011-09-26T22:12:48  <j3camero> Okay I will send off some letters tomorrow to shake our tin cup.
2011-09-26T22:13:03  <a1k0n_> are you getting sponsorship from google this time?
2011-09-26T22:13:05  <aarossig> amstan: I dare say my pentium 4 server would have been better
2011-09-26T22:13:07  *** a1k0n_ is now known as a1k0n
2011-09-26T22:13:30  <amstan> aarossig: in pw the main server was worse than yours
2011-09-26T22:13:37  <a1k0n> you should have done the contest site in appengine
2011-09-26T22:13:46  <j3camero> janzert: why would we launch on a Sunday?
2011-09-26T22:13:53  <amstan> a1k0n: appengine can't really do what we're doing
2011-09-26T22:14:00  <McLeopold> j3camero: can someone have access to create A records for dns?
2011-09-26T22:14:01  <a1k0n> yeah, i know.  unless you require everybody to write python.
2011-09-26T22:14:04  <a1k0n> i was kidding.
2011-09-26T22:14:06  <aarossig> lol
2011-09-26T22:14:09  <amstan> a1k0n: they're too limited, only having go and python
2011-09-26T22:14:16  <janzert> it's just a good time for McLeopold and I to get together to get it rolling
2011-09-26T22:14:18  <a1k0n> oh there's go?  well, that's all you need
2011-09-26T22:14:18  <aarossig> amstan: pw?
2011-09-26T22:14:20  <McLeopold> or can you create some for us? tron.ai-contest.com, pw., ants.
2011-09-26T22:14:34  <amstan> j3camero: i can handle dns if you want
2011-09-26T22:14:36  <j3camero> a1k0n: I can do you one better. The google AI Challenge is now a Facebook app. Just like Farmville1
2011-09-26T22:14:43  <a1k0n> haha.  nooooooooo
2011-09-26T22:14:44  <aarossig> j3camero: dude, no
2011-09-26T22:14:48  <aarossig> worse api ever
2011-09-26T22:14:51  <aarossig> worst*
2011-09-26T22:14:57  <j3camero> Yeah I got no problem letting people control the domain.
2011-09-26T22:15:00  <a1k0n> google+ game?
2011-09-26T22:15:20  <j3camero> amstan, janzert, whoever wants to.
2011-09-26T22:15:25  <amstan> j3camero: i can do it
2011-09-26T22:15:29  <j3camero> Yup.
2011-09-26T22:15:55  <j3camero> Okay so why don't we launch this baby on a Friday night?
2011-09-26T22:16:12  <amstan> j3camero: yeah, i was lurking on #csc
2011-09-26T22:16:15  <j3camero> That way the lot of us can actually stay up late into the night should the web server get crushed or other problems hahppen.
2011-09-26T22:16:16  <amstan> j3camero: uw has a code party
2011-09-26T22:16:19  <aarossig> j3camero: that would be awesome
2011-09-26T22:16:28  <amstan> j3camero: on friday
2011-09-26T22:16:33  <aarossig> amstan: then we don't have to come home early on sunday
2011-09-26T22:16:48  <amstan> McLeopold: what do you think?
2011-09-26T22:16:53  <McLeopold> umm...
2011-09-26T22:17:00  <j3camero> Code party is an awesome time to launch a contest.
2011-09-26T22:17:08  <j3camero> You could have a live traffic graph up and such.
2011-09-26T22:17:20  <amstan> j3camero: except only jbroman's at uwaterloo from here
2011-09-26T22:17:25  <aarossig> j3camero: I was thinking about doing something..... no commitment from me yet though
2011-09-26T22:17:28  <McLeopold> maybe, if we get the tutorial and starters going
2011-09-26T22:18:27  <amstan> McLeopold: won't starters be fairly easy? just email everyone that made starters to update their stuff
2011-09-26T22:18:47  <McLeopold> amstan: yes, starters are easy to update
2011-09-26T22:19:18  <McLeopold> just reading 'h' lines, storing the info somehow, no logic change
2011-09-26T22:19:23  <janzert> hmm, I'm not sure how well this Friday will work. I guess if all the permissions come in and it looks like everything else is actually ready I can see how my schedule is looking
2011-09-26T22:19:52  <j3camero> I was thinking the Friday after next.
2011-09-26T22:20:00  <j3camero> Very little odds that we will be ready this Friday.
2011-09-26T22:20:03  <amstan> j3camero: that's no code party then
2011-09-26T22:20:13  <McLeopold> oh *a* Friday night
2011-09-26T22:20:26  <janzert> well, if we're not ready by this Friday we probably aren't ready by this Sunday either?
2011-09-26T22:20:29  <McLeopold> yeah, that feels beter
2011-09-26T22:20:42  <janzert> but ok, if we can't hit this Sunday I'd be fine with next Friday
2011-09-26T22:20:55  <j3camero> Why Sunday?
2011-09-26T22:21:07  <amstan> work during the weekend probably
2011-09-26T22:21:09  <j3camero> Just so it goes live Monday when there is little traffic?
2011-09-26T22:21:12  <aarossig> if we go for next friday you give me a little time to think about a realtime traffic visualizer
2011-09-26T22:21:22  <janzert> that's a good reason too :P
2011-09-26T22:21:22  <McLeopold> so, the 7th to the 10th I'm going to be gone
2011-09-26T22:21:33  <amstan> that won't work then
2011-09-26T22:21:36  <aarossig> damn.
2011-09-26T22:21:37  <amstan> saturday?
2011-09-26T22:21:43  <amstan> this one
2011-09-26T22:22:14  <janzert> I'll be mostly unavailable 12-15th, but hopefully we're launched by then
2011-09-26T22:22:23  <j3camero> I think less than a week is a bit soon.
2011-09-26T22:22:55  <j3camero> Janzert how are you Thurs the 13th?
2011-09-26T22:23:13  <janzert> in the middle of a big show, but I don't know my full schedule for it yet
2011-09-26T22:23:22  <j3camero> Here's my angle: everyone reads about it on Reddit on Friday morning and afternoon, and starts working on Saturday.
2011-09-26T22:23:25  <McLeopold> ugg, that's so far away
2011-09-26T22:23:27  <aarossig> amstan: are we running the current version of apache on the servers?
2011-09-26T22:23:36  <amstan> aarossig: yes, natty
2011-09-26T22:23:45  <aarossig> amstan: great, thanks -- i'll use those logs for reference.
2011-09-26T22:23:48  <amstan> well.. bottom line, if it's not this weekend, then it's the 21st
2011-09-26T22:23:49  <McLeopold> j3camero: but, it can still be live for 4 days before that?
2011-09-26T22:24:03  <janzert> amstan or middle of next possibly
2011-09-26T22:24:13  *** eashoka <eashoka!708743ac@gateway/web/freenode/ip.112.135.67.172> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-26T22:24:57  <j3camero> I guess there's no reason not to launch this upcoming weekend, as long as the tutorials are nice and polished by then.
2011-09-26T22:24:59  <ChrisH> janzert: FYI, the worker is down again
2011-09-26T22:24:59  <janzert> maybe next Wednesday
2011-09-26T22:25:13  <j3camero> Does anyone want to commit to a tutorial or two before this Friday?
2011-09-26T22:25:28  <j3camero> Next Wednesday could work.
2011-09-26T22:25:49  <janzert> ChrisH: looks like ec2 took it down again, spot prices have been really funky today
2011-09-26T22:25:56  <janzert> first time in months
2011-09-26T22:26:11  <McLeopold> maybe it's a yearly cycle?
2011-09-26T22:26:54  <amstan> antimatroid: wanna make tutorials?
2011-09-26T22:27:00  <j3camero> Sorry janzert I meant Thursday the 6th of Oct.
2011-09-26T22:27:10  <j3camero> How do that work for you?
2011-09-26T22:27:26  <McLeopold> I'm okay with the 6th
2011-09-26T22:27:38  <janzert> at this point any day except Monday next week should work for me
2011-09-26T22:27:42  <j3camero> I guess if we launch when the both of us have decent amount of time, then I can get trained up on how to keep it running as well.
2011-09-26T22:28:14  <janzert> mostly it's just fire and forget
2011-09-26T22:28:28  <janzert> mostly just code changes break it at this point
2011-09-26T22:28:52  <ChrisH> janzert: does ec2 bring it back automatically when prices drop again?
2011-09-26T22:28:52  <j3camero> Okay, so I propose launching in the evening of Thurs, Oct 6, EST. Any reason we shoudl not do this?
2011-09-26T22:29:11  <janzert> sounds fine with me
2011-09-26T22:29:44  <amstan> what about the launch party?
2011-09-26T22:30:02  <j3camero> Between now and then, I will do my best to get the Google brand and a bit of cash for running servers. Event absent either of those, we can still proceed.
2011-09-26T22:30:07  <janzert> amstan: will you be setting up new forums on the final server?
2011-09-26T22:30:18  <j3camero> amstan: I will have to coordinate with the CSC to organize a launch party, if they care.
2011-09-26T22:30:20  <amstan> janzert: yes, i'll also get them updated
2011-09-26T22:30:25  <janzert> ok
2011-09-26T22:30:37  <amstan> j3camero: see if jbroman's interested
2011-09-26T22:30:43  <j3camero> Yeah good idea.
2011-09-26T22:30:49  <janzert> we could probably close the old ones and point something like planetwars.ai-contest.com at the current site?
2011-09-26T22:31:09  <amstan> janzert: what size is the old site?
2011-09-26T22:31:13  <j3camero> Okay guys I am heading to bed. I have to get up at an ungodly hour.
2011-09-26T22:31:18  <amstan> j3camero: cya
2011-09-26T22:31:21  <janzert> huge :/
2011-09-26T22:31:26  <amstan> janzert: yeah.. that's the problem
2011-09-26T22:31:30  <janzert> I don't remember exactly
2011-09-26T22:31:34  * janzert nods
2011-09-26T22:31:52  <amstan> is there a way to remove the games that are not linked on the site anymore?
2011-09-26T22:32:17  <janzert> I think they're all linked one way or another
2011-09-26T22:32:24  <amstan> sigh
2011-09-26T22:32:33  <amstan> how huge are we talking about?
2011-09-26T22:32:36  <amstan> 10s of GB?
2011-09-26T22:32:41  <janzert> just sec
2011-09-26T22:33:06  <janzert> 53GB for the database
2011-09-26T22:33:19  <amstan> that's with the old leaderboards though
2011-09-26T22:33:41  <amstan> oh, and games table
2011-09-26T22:33:42  <amstan> i guess
2011-09-26T22:33:44  <janzert> games are 50GB
2011-09-26T22:34:06  <amstan> is archival without games acceptable?
2011-09-26T22:34:15  <j3camero> Maybe dump the games to some huge compressed text file and create a torrent for it. Then the game replays would just 404 on the site and probably no one cares.
2011-09-26T22:34:17  <amstan> is there a way to archive the games?
2011-09-26T22:34:31  <amstan> j3camero: who would seed?
2011-09-26T22:34:44  <janzert> not currently there isn't
2011-09-26T22:34:47  <j3camero> Always the problem with torrents, eh.
2011-09-26T22:34:47  <aarossig> amstan: I volunteer
2011-09-26T22:34:52  <amstan> aarossig: lol
2011-09-26T22:34:55  <aarossig> though it will be slow
2011-09-26T22:35:13  <amstan> aarossig: that's 50 HD episodes..
2011-09-26T22:35:21  <amstan> aarossig: that you could be storing instead
2011-09-26T22:35:31  <aarossig> amstan: there is no better feeling that uploading way more than my download on an asynchronous connection
2011-09-26T22:35:53  <aarossig> amstan: I doubt anyone will ever download it, but if they do I will leave it seeding
2011-09-26T22:36:28  <amstan> janzert: as long as the old server remains, and i have a place to put the archive server, it should be fairly easy
2011-09-26T22:37:08  <McLeopold> aren't the replays in the database?
2011-09-26T22:37:21  <janzert> McLeopold: right, that's why it's 53GB
2011-09-26T22:37:22  <amstan> McLeopold: i think we moved them out in the middle of the contest last time
2011-09-26T22:37:26  <janzert> nope
2011-09-26T22:37:38  <amstan> well, still
2011-09-26T22:37:39  <janzert> they were only stored in the database for the whole contest
2011-09-26T22:37:42  <amstan> games without replays are kinda useless
2011-09-26T22:38:17  <janzert> php served the replay data embedded in the html page with the visualizer
2011-09-26T22:38:40  <McLeopold> myisampack
2011-09-26T22:38:51  <amstan> McLeopold: perfect
2011-09-26T22:38:58  <amstan> that solves the space issue
2011-09-26T22:39:06  <amstan> what about where to put it?
2011-09-26T22:39:11  <amstan> main server? buy another server?
2011-09-26T22:39:28  <janzert> I guess see how big it ends up being
2011-09-26T22:39:43  <aarossig> I have >700GB available, I would be willing to archive it for a year a least
2011-09-26T22:39:52  <amstan> janzert: i also want to get tron and rps
2011-09-26T22:39:53  <janzert> I'd rather stick it on a different server than the current contest main server
2011-09-26T22:39:54  <aarossig> aarossig: that doesn't mean fast access... but access nonetheless
2011-09-26T22:40:14  <amstan> aarossig: it's supposed to be reliable though
2011-09-26T22:40:34  <janzert> it should fairly be low traffic to all the old contests so should be good on a smaller server
2011-09-26T22:40:35  <aarossig> amstan: well.. i'm about 90% reliable, but your call
2011-09-26T22:41:51  <amstan> janzert: well, i need someone to buy me a server and i can set all this up nicely
2011-09-26T22:42:05  <amstan> or maybe i should ask j3camero
2011-09-26T22:42:32  <janzert> yep, probably as soon as he finds out what sort of funding he has
2011-09-26T22:49:05  <ChrisH> janzert: earlier we were talking about whether the server should send the bots information about how many ants are in a hive waiting to spawn. This might be really important if the bot has no way to know the order of the hives on a multi hive map.
2011-09-26T22:49:33  <janzert> you're "spawn queue
2011-09-26T22:49:37  <janzert> " is global
2011-09-26T22:49:54  <janzert> i.e. there is one hive, even if you have multiple hills
2011-09-26T22:50:19  <janzert> I believe thats why the distinction in terminology between hive and hill
2011-09-26T22:50:38  <ChrisH> ok, I hadn't realized that nuance. but strategically it could matter which hill gets the next spawning ant
2011-09-26T22:51:07  <janzert> the one last occupied by a friendly ant, so the bot can control where the next spawn happens
2011-09-26T22:51:15  <janzert> ties are broken randomly
2011-09-26T22:51:19  <ChrisH> interesting.
2011-09-26T22:51:55  <ChrisH> but then, why don't they just keep spawning from the same hill, as that would be the last one to have a friendly ant (the previous spawn)
2011-09-26T22:52:07  <olexs> will only one ant spawn in a turn, or can multiple ants from the hive spawn at once on multiple hills?
2011-09-26T22:52:18  <janzert> only one spawn per turn
2011-09-26T22:53:39  <janzert> ChrisH: yeah, without active bot intervention that is what would happen
2011-09-26T22:54:27  <McLeopold> one spawn per hill per turn
2011-09-26T22:54:29  <ChrisH> That's not what I see in replays,.
2011-09-26T22:54:38  <McLeopold> and I have a solution to xathis's delima
2011-09-26T22:54:47  <xathis> i'm interested
2011-09-26T22:54:53  <ChrisH> The spawn rotate through each hill in a sequence.
2011-09-26T22:55:07  <McLeopold> if your ant dies on your own hill, the hill is destroyed
2011-09-26T22:55:22  <xathis> that's clever
2011-09-26T22:55:56  <xathis> but what if you put ants not directly in attacking distance but 1 more
2011-09-26T22:56:25  <janzert> McLeopold: I don't think xathis dilemna works though
2011-09-26T22:56:46  <xathis> why not?
2011-09-26T22:56:49  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Doesn't that make destroying a hill too easy?
2011-09-26T22:56:51  <janzert> so long as the bot steps its ant off the other hill right away the next ant should keep spawning at the safe hill
2011-09-26T22:57:23  <janzert> and yeah, that fix might be worse than the problem
2011-09-26T22:57:32  <ChrisH> janzert: Your explanation doesn't match the current implementation.
2011-09-26T22:57:50  <janzert> hmm, well it's my understanding of the way it was supposed to work
2011-09-26T22:58:03  <janzert> maybe I got it wrong, McLeopold came up with that mechanic
2011-09-26T22:58:26  <McLeopold> xathis: then, the hill owner can stay on the hill and prevent spawning

2011-09-26T22:59:10  <McLeopold> janzert: I think you are backwards
2011-09-26T22:59:12  <xathis> McLeopold: yeah you're right this sounds good
2011-09-26T22:59:36  <janzert> hmm?

2011-09-26T22:59:42  <ChrisH> McLeopold: so the squatter alternates killing the ant on top of the hill and standing back.
2011-09-26T22:59:48  <janzert> it's least recently stepped on that spawns?
2011-09-26T23:00:18  *** rofer is now known as construction_wor
2011-09-26T23:00:25  *** construction_wor is now known as rofer
2011-09-26T23:01:13  <janzert> I think that would make it impossible to stop xathis' attack  then
2011-09-26T23:01:46  <ChrisH> without a rescue force
2011-09-26T23:01:55  <janzert> yes
2011-09-26T23:02:24  <janzert> even if it works I'm not sure how serious of a problem it will be in practice
2011-09-26T23:02:46  <ChrisH> but under a "xanthis attack" its harder to construct one because your spawn are being siphoned off.
2011-09-26T23:02:55  <janzert> if it is a real problem I'd rather reverse the spawn order than make a dieing ant on the hill destroy the hill

2011-09-26T23:03:24  <xathis> it's alright. if your enemy has control over your hill you just leace one of your ants on it. So while the enemy isn't attacking the ant, new ants will spawn at other hills. and if he attack it, than your hill is destroyed
2011-09-26T23:03:32  <xathis> *leave
2011-09-26T23:04:15  <ChrisH> xathis: that's not good when you have only one hill, now the enemy can destroy your hill even if you have a large reserve in the hive.
2011-09-26T23:05:18  * janzert nods
2011-09-26T23:05:28  <xathis> chrisH: that's true, so this should probably not happen with the last hill of any player
2011-09-26T23:05:35  <McLeopold> who cares about 1 hill, your dead anyway
2011-09-26T23:05:40  <McLeopold> your ants have to spawn there
2011-09-26T23:06:02  <janzert> yeah, I'd rather the hive has to be emptied out before the hill can be destroyed at least in the single hill case
2011-09-26T23:06:41  <McLeopold> the only other solution is to introduce a new order type that let's you specify open hills
2011-09-26T23:06:50  <ChrisH> I care if I have reinforcements on the way that can drive off two the enemy ants before my hive is emptied.
2011-09-26T23:07:23  <McLeopold> ChrisH: the point is, the enemy has control of your hill, and you wont be able to save it anyway
2011-09-26T23:07:25  <ChrisH> Then the bot still has a chance to survie.
2011-09-26T23:07:44  <janzert> what are the disadvantages of reversing the spawn order to most recent occupied wins?
2011-09-26T23:08:00  <McLeopold> the hill is effectively dead at that point, we are preventing them from siphoning your hive
2011-09-26T23:08:10  <janzert> naive bots will all spawn at the same location, but I'm not sure that is a big deal
2011-09-26T23:08:12  <ChrisH> Sure you can save it.  The enemy has two ants squatting on your last hill, and you have 10 ants 5 spaces away, you could take out the 2 squatters and liberate your hill
2011-09-26T23:08:14  <McLeopold> janzert: you can't ever switch
2011-09-26T23:08:35  <janzert> sure you can, stay on the active hill for one turn or step on another one

2011-09-26T23:08:49  <McLeopold> ChrisH: no, the 2 squaters see you coming and step on the hill
2011-09-26T23:09:00  <janzert> you've then made that your active hill
2011-09-26T23:09:13  <janzert> I'm also not opposed to an explicit order by the way
2011-09-26T23:09:18  <ChrisH> They can't step on it if there are a bunch of ants coming out of it, more than the 5 turns it takes your rescue force to arrive.
2011-09-26T23:09:42  <McLeopold> ChrisH: 1 ant at a time, you move in at the same distance and don't take a loss
2011-09-26T23:09:51  <McLeopold> spawn is after battle and raze
2011-09-26T23:10:08  <janzert> and I'm also still not seeing anything that interesting in multi-hill maps either :}
2011-09-26T23:10:28  <McLeopold> if the hill has 2 enemies in attack range, and reinforcements are not, the hill is just gone
2011-09-26T23:10:52  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I'm assuming there are already spawned ants nearby that can force the enemy ants to retreat. I'm not understanding your point.
2011-09-26T23:10:57  <McLeopold> janzert: we don't have properly mixed hills yet
2011-09-26T23:11:26  <janzert> I meant the idea in general really
2011-09-26T23:11:34  <McLeopold> if they are within attack range, the squatters would have died already
2011-09-26T23:12:26  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Here is my scenario: 100 ants in the hive being killed off one at a time by 2 enemy squatters, with 10 friendly ants within 5 turns of the hill.
2011-09-26T23:12:31  <janzert> I'd really rather not make it easier to have a hill killed though
2011-09-26T23:13:04  <janzert> I'd prefer the explicit order or reversing the spawn order of the three
2011-09-26T23:13:12  <ChrisH> I argue that those 10 friendly ants can kill or drive off the 2 squatters before all 100 ants are dead and (under the current rules) the enemy could step on the hill.
2011-09-26T23:13:20  <antiuni> janzert: sorry if this has been answered, reading logs, why would the game end if only one bot had a hill left?
2011-09-26T23:13:27  *** eashoka <eashoka!708743ac@gateway/web/freenode/ip.112.135.67.172> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-09-26T23:13:28  <antiuni> shouldn't the remaining enemy ants get to try and take that hill out?
2011-09-26T23:13:53  <smiley1983> is the plan still to give a list of first-time-seen land, like we get for water?
2011-09-26T23:14:21  <janzert> it's sort of a compromise between completely removing a bot if all of their hills are destroyed and leaving them fully in the game
2011-09-26T23:14:37  <McLeopold> antiuni: only if the 1 ant with the hill is behind and can actually take the lead
2011-09-26T23:14:53  <ChrisH> or improve their rank?
2011-09-26T23:14:55  <McLeopold> ...does the game continue
2011-09-26T23:15:18  <antiuni> wouldn't it be if the ant without hills can take the lead?
2011-09-26T23:15:26  <antiuni> as they can score more points by taking out the remaining hill
2011-09-26T23:15:32  <antiuni> and take points off the bot with a hill
2011-09-26T23:15:42  <janzert> basically the bots that don't have a hill left can still control their remaining ants and try to win still but they don't get to keep the game continuing on
2011-09-26T23:16:02  <antiuni> ah okay
2011-09-26T23:16:37  <McLeopold> ChrisH: so, the xathis delima is that 2 ants can sit at a hill, killing all ants that spawn there without losses.  There is no saving the hill in this situation.  If you had ants close enough, they would be dead already.  If you move to kill them, they can just step on the hill and destroy it.  There is just no saving the hill in that situation.
2011-09-26T23:16:42  <janzert> McLeopold: if there is only 1 ant with a hill left that ant can't gain any more points
2011-09-26T23:17:06  <janzert> as soon as there is only one ant with hill(s) the game should end regardless
2011-09-26T23:17:27  <janzert> it's actually the lone survivor ending
2011-09-26T23:17:30  <McLeopold> janzert: right, I was thinking of 2 bots left, 1 ant hill left and the current leader has already lost its hill
2011-09-26T23:17:47  <McLeopold> so it needs to defend until max turns
2011-09-26T23:17:55  <ChrisH> McLeopold: There is no guarantee that the rescue force is already dead, and how can one of the enemies step on the hill if it is still spawning?
2011-09-26T23:18:07  <janzert> I'd say the game should still end right away
2011-09-26T23:18:10  <McLeopold> no the squatters would already be dead
2011-09-26T23:18:34  <janzert> if the leader lost his hill he lost the position to force the game to continue
2011-09-26T23:18:46  <ChrisH> Why is that, the rescue force is still 5 turns out of range for killing them.
2011-09-26T23:18:57  <McLeopold> janzert: but then he can suicide to force a win
2011-09-26T23:19:08  <janzert> who?
2011-09-26T23:19:14  <janzert> the leader?
2011-09-26T23:19:32  <janzert> the guy behind can't catch up anyway
2011-09-26T23:19:35  <McLeopold> ChrisH: if the rescue force is 5 turns out of range, then the squatters will see the rescue and just step on the hill
2011-09-26T23:19:43  <janzert> there isn't anything for him to catch up with
2011-09-26T23:19:45  <McLeopold> the squatters get to destroy the hill no matter what
2011-09-26T23:20:20  <McLeopold> janzert: if there is a bot with a hill that can still gain in rank, then the game continues, otherwise it ends
2011-09-26T23:20:21  <ChrisH> McLeopold: but there are still 100 ants in the hive, I didn't think they could step on the hill if it is spawning.  (We're talking about the last hill for the defender here.)
2011-09-26T23:20:41  <McLeopold> ChrisH:  you can step on a hill at any time, the hive count doesn't matter
2011-09-26T23:21:00  <McLeopold> ChrisH: one spawn at a hill per turn, after attack and raze
2011-09-26T23:21:04  <janzert> although it can be very expensive
2011-09-26T23:21:20  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Oh, that's my misunderstanding.
2011-09-26T23:21:32  <McLeopold> cool :)
2011-09-26T23:21:32  <janzert> or maybe not
2011-09-26T23:21:59  <ChrisH> but move comes before attack, right?
2011-09-26T23:22:11  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-26T23:22:15  <janzert> McLeopold: add an explicit order the bot can give and be done with it :)
2011-09-26T23:22:45  <McLeopold> janzert: it works, it doesn't change the game hardly at all
2011-09-26T23:22:49  <janzert> it will probably save us a lot of explaining
2011-09-26T23:23:01  <McLeopold> if an enemy ant is near your hill, the hill should be gone anyway, you need to defend
2011-09-26T23:23:11  <ChrisH> let me just play this out one step at a time to make sure I'm clear, (please bear with me)
2011-09-26T23:23:29  <McLeopold> sry, I really need to go
2011-09-26T23:23:30  <ChrisH> Assume I have an ant on top of my hill holding in the 100 reserves.
2011-09-26T23:23:38  <McLeopold> can we put this in a  github issue?
2011-09-26T23:23:40  <ChrisH> when the two squatters arrive.
2011-09-26T23:24:11  <ChrisH> we can chat another time
2011-09-26T23:24:14  <McLeopold> oik
