2011-06-30T01:10:15  <antimatroid1> mcstar: what if bot input had "a row col player directionToPreviousSquare"
2011-06-30T01:10:31  <antimatroid1> where direction to previous square is  {N,E,S,W}
2011-06-30T01:10:37  <mcstar> wait, 5 4
2011-06-30T01:10:40  <mcstar> 3 2 1
2011-06-30T01:10:44  <mcstar> ok, eyes open
2011-06-30T01:10:50  <antimatroid1> erm, {N,E,S,W,X|*
2011-06-30T01:10:56  <antimatroid1> where X is the ant didn't move
2011-06-30T01:11:02  <mcstar> C
2011-06-30T01:11:08  <mcstar> as inc centre
2011-06-30T01:11:13  <mcstar> ?
2011-06-30T01:11:26  <mcstar> so you agree?
2011-06-30T01:11:43  <antimatroid1> i dunno, i kind of liked the idea of having to try and match dead ants to old enemy ants
2011-06-30T01:11:46  <antimatroid1> but i don;t really mind
2011-06-30T01:12:07  <antimatroid1> old bots should still work fine
2011-06-30T01:12:26  <antimatroid1> as they are meant to ignore input they don't understand
2011-06-30T01:12:47  <mcstar> in the meantime i thought about it, and if theres a discrepancy, the ant which takes a place of another for some reason could just assume the role of that one
2011-06-30T01:13:28  <mcstar> so, it might not be too hard to live without it, but i think it would still make life easier

2011-06-30T01:14:47  <mcstar> you should implement an s line

2011-06-30T01:42:08  <mcstar> power was interrupted
2011-06-30T01:46:00  <janzert> strictly speaking where an ant was the previous move is completely irrelevant as it makes no difference for the current or future state
2011-06-30T01:49:02  <mcstar> janzert: it would aid the tracking of them
2011-06-30T01:50:42  <janzert> and I mean tracking them is completely irrelevant since the past state doesn't have any ongoing effect :)
2011-06-30T01:51:32  <mcstar> not true: startegies dont change turn by turn
2011-06-30T01:51:37  <mcstar> ra
2011-06-30T01:52:16  <mcstar> it depends on the bot whether it has memory of past states or not
2011-06-30T01:52:24  <janzert> but whether an ant got to a position by stepping there from the north or south or simply having spawned there makes no difference whatsoever the same actions are available to it
2011-06-30T01:52:31  <mcstar> thats a different story that the engine doesnt need to know the past
2011-06-30T01:53:07  <mcstar> yes, thats true, thats why i said before that it wouldnt be hard to implement tracking
2011-06-30T01:53:10  <janzert> I'm saying from a game theoretic stance keeping track of past states is useless
2011-06-30T01:53:33  <janzert> a bot of course may want to do some incremental updating of its internal state
2011-06-30T01:53:41  <mcstar> well, from an implementation point of view its not useless

2011-06-30T01:54:13  <janzert> but I think it should simply be smart enough to do that by looking at the present state
2011-06-30T01:54:28  <janzert> present state of the game that is
2011-06-30T01:54:43  <stocha> why give a bonus to the last botst that has not timed out, when it has utterly been defeated by all other bots ?  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=45689&user=107
2011-06-30T01:54:46  <mcstar> ok, but it would be easier if we could just match up past ants with present ones
2011-06-30T01:55:01  <mcstar> need to move less data around, not destroy some structures...
2011-06-30T01:55:39  <janzert> stocha: I would personally rather that any timed out bot is set to last place
2011-06-30T01:56:10  <stocha> janzert: okay. But still why give a bonus to the loosing bot ?
2011-06-30T01:56:11  <janzert> i.e. doesn't get any points at all
2011-06-30T01:56:23  <janzert> it was the winning bot not the losing bot
2011-06-30T01:56:30  <mcstar> go tighten them if their loose
2011-06-30T01:56:34  <stocha> like he has 0 point, and no chance of getting much more (like the game i linked). But he get the 1000+ bonus and sudenly ends up first ?
2011-06-30T01:56:39  <janzert> by virtue of playing correctly for longer than any other bot
2011-06-30T01:56:57  <janzert> first is the position he should be in
2011-06-30T01:57:02  <stocha> janzert: it certainly isn't the case of the linked game
2011-06-30T01:57:23  <janzert> btw, I don't agree much with the scoring method so I'm the wrong one to defend it ;)
2011-06-30T01:57:27  <stocha> he should be last. He has no chance of having more point than the other bots in the game, with the strategy it use.
2011-06-30T01:57:38  <stocha> janzert: ah okay.
2011-06-30T01:57:59  <janzert> all other bots died before him so he should be first, that part I agree with
2011-06-30T01:58:01  <stocha> janzert: what is the state of the concensus with the scoring method then ?
2011-06-30T01:58:15  <janzert> that we're probably not going to change it?
2011-06-30T01:58:24  <mcstar> stocha: your problem is that stocha won?
2011-06-30T01:59:05  <stocha> janzert: although i'm not to defend to be that harsh with timeout bot. I think the ant should lay still (big thing already). They you added the it gets no more score. That's enough for me. Why make it autoloose.
2011-06-30T01:59:19  <stocha> mcstar: i'm just discussing the scoring method.
2011-06-30T01:59:25  <janzert> actually I would fight much more strongly against the current scoring method if stocha hadn't come first in that game ;)
2011-06-30T01:59:47  <stocha> mcstar: it happens that i look more at my bots games, so they will often be participating in the example i give :)
2011-06-30T02:00:15  <stocha> janzert: there need to be a serious discussion on the scoring then.
2011-06-30T02:00:21  <mcstar> actually you have a point
2011-06-30T02:00:36  <janzert> stocha: rather late for that
2011-06-30T02:00:41  <stocha> janzert: i'm happy with the scoring in itself. Trying to have a bonus for bots that do combat.
2011-06-30T02:01:00  <mcstar> the scoring assumes that your bot could have eaten all of sir macelon's after it timed out
2011-06-30T02:01:00  <stocha> janzert: although there should be more points for killing than grabing food then.
2011-06-30T02:01:02  <janzert> the serious scoring discussion was months ago
2011-06-30T02:01:17  <stocha> janzert: the difference is that now there are data.
2011-06-30T02:01:28  <janzert> and so far as I'm concerned it's working good enough
2011-06-30T02:01:35  <janzert> so don't touch it
2011-06-30T02:01:36  <stocha> month ago, i would have serious doubt on the current scoring.
2011-06-30T02:01:50  <janzert> we need to get other things finished off and get the contest going
2011-06-30T02:02:00  <mcstar> +1
2011-06-30T02:02:09  <stocha> But, i don't like this timeout make the last no time out automatically win. This is not coherent with the scoring.
2011-06-30T02:02:57  <stocha> janzert: incoherent scoring will get some people endlessly arguing. So if it is easy to settle logically it should be done.
2011-06-30T02:03:17  <janzert> you can console yourself that it pretty certainly won't effect the top rankings at all
2011-06-30T02:03:21  <stocha> What i ask for, is that the game still plays out when only one bot is remaining without timing out.
2011-06-30T02:03:30  <stocha> and that the score follow the usual logic.
2011-06-30T02:03:35  <janzert> we can go back to a timeout/crash removes you from the contest ;)

2011-06-30T02:03:52  <mcstar> :S
2011-06-30T02:04:02  <stocha> janzert: that's insane. Because the timeout might be to blame on the contest, not the bot.
2011-06-30T02:05:00  <stocha> janzert: who am i to convince, if not you ?
2011-06-30T02:05:09  <janzert> personally I think timeout basically removing you from the current game is good enough though removing from the rest of the contest is too harsh :)
2011-06-30T02:05:11  <stocha> janzert: i though you was the big influencial guy around.
2011-06-30T02:05:26  <janzert> well I'll pretty much oppose score changes at this point
2011-06-30T02:05:53  <janzert> and really oppose anything that lessens the last surviving bots chance of being the overall winner
2011-06-30T02:05:56  <stocha> janzert: what i don't like is :   bot B get 100 score. Bot c get 200 score. Bot d get 1 score (but still there). Bot e get 10000 score, but times out
2011-06-30T02:06:12  <stocha> bot d wins over B and C. although it have no chance of catching up.
2011-06-30T02:06:30  <stocha> that is not fair for B and C, that won by the rules. But the tiemout screw it up.
2011-06-30T02:06:39  <janzert> being last survivor should trump everything else so far as I'm concerned
2011-06-30T02:07:01  <janzert> the bot has shown itself to be better than all the rest
2011-06-30T02:07:26  <stocha> janzert: yeah, but either you go for last survivor win, or for best fighter win. But not with best fighter win unless a strong bot timeout in whatever case that is last remaining bot win
2011-06-30T02:07:42  <janzert> and I'm opposed to best fighter win
2011-06-30T02:07:43  <stocha> I want it to be coherent, not schizophrenic scoring.
2011-06-30T02:07:58  <stocha> janzert: yet you said you were happy with the scoring.
2011-06-30T02:08:07  <janzert> no, I said I don't want it changed
2011-06-30T02:08:10  <stocha> janzert: don't you see the need for coherence in there ?
2011-06-30T02:08:12  <janzert> and it works good enough
2011-06-30T02:08:25  <janzert> nope
2011-06-30T02:08:43  <stocha> janzert: when there is no time out yes. When there are, especially if it's a strong bot, things are screwed. And coward bots get a bit bonus.
2011-06-30T02:08:44  <janzert> coherence in scoring is a really minor concern for me
2011-06-30T02:09:02  <stocha> (wich is the case of the stocha bot here, with sir_macelon timing out very often.)
2011-06-30T02:09:17  <stocha> janzert: whom am i to speak with then ?
2011-06-30T02:10:30  <janzert> to get it changed? like I said I'm actively opposed to changing it, so in order to change it you'd have to convince amstan and mcleopold to vote against me I suppose
2011-06-30T02:11:11  <stocha> mcstar: i agree with you in that i think a lot of people will want to track their ants. But changing the communication now seems a bit unwise.
2011-06-30T02:11:45  <stocha> mcstar: so i didn't tryed to assess if you proposal was a good way to help people track their ant or not.
2011-06-30T02:12:09  <mcstar> assess it then :)
2011-06-30T02:13:02  <mcstar> as janzert said, it shouldnt cause problems for existing bots
2011-06-30T02:13:20  <mcstar> mine ignores superfluous arguments too
2011-06-30T02:13:21  <antimatroid1> janzert: wrt tracking ant deaths
2011-06-30T02:13:40  <antimatroid1> if you propogate information about where an enemy ant might be based on where you last saw a live one, you can not propogate information from that ant
2011-06-30T02:13:42  <stocha> @later tell amstan there is an issue with time out that makes the scoring that is supposed to support the best fighting not working.  bot B get 100 score. Bot c get 200 score. Bot d get 1 score (but still there). Bot e get 10000 score, but times out.   In my view, when only one bot remain by timeout effect (especially if it lost against other nottimeout eliminated bots) the game should play out. The the scoring stay coherent.
2011-06-30T02:13:42  <contestbot> stocha: As you wish.
2011-06-30T02:13:52  <antimatroid1> which if you're hunting down an enemy in a maze could be quite helpful no?
2011-06-30T02:14:24  <janzert> antimatroid1: who was talking about tracking ant deaths? ;)
2011-06-30T02:14:42  <antimatroid1> ignore me then
2011-06-30T02:14:48  <janzert> I haven't put much thought into that at all
2011-06-30T02:14:49  <antimatroid1> oh wait, ant moves?
2011-06-30T02:14:53  <stocha> mcstar: i don't like the idea that the protocol change. A lot of beta participant has already buit the ant tracking system anyway.
2011-06-30T02:15:29  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-06-30T02:15:35  <antimatroid1> stocha: your bot doesn't need to change
2011-06-30T02:15:38  <janzert> antimatroid1: yes, the idea was to give where an ant moved from
2011-06-30T02:15:44  <amstan> janzert: why is he pinging me at this ungodly hour? lol
2011-06-30T02:15:47  <antimatroid1> wouldn;t that include dead ants?
2011-06-30T02:16:14  <janzert> I don't think so
2011-06-30T02:16:25  <janzert> a dead ant no longer exists in the game state right
2011-06-30T02:16:34  <mcstar> only the still living ants of yours would get the info of where teyre coming from
2011-06-30T02:16:36  <antimatroid1> no, but you receive information if you see an ant die
2011-06-30T02:16:48  <amstan> stocha: idk, i can't concentrate about this so late
2011-06-30T02:17:03  <amstan> stocha: and i'm not really into the ant logistics
2011-06-30T02:17:20  <antimatroid1> i would have expected the information to be coming under the idea that you can see the movement of stuff in view
2011-06-30T02:17:22  <amstan> stocha: i would go with what antimatroid things
2011-06-30T02:17:23  <antimatroid1> so we'll give you that information
2011-06-30T02:17:25  <amstan> thinks*

2011-06-30T02:18:03  <amstan> janzert: he doesn't like a lot of things though
2011-06-30T02:18:07  * antimatroid1 is lost
2011-06-30T02:18:42  <janzert> amstan: sorry, I let slip that to overule me he has to convince you and mcleopold :P
2011-06-30T02:18:53  <amstan> oh np, i'm just kidding around
2011-06-30T02:19:13  <stocha> @later tell McLeopold there is an issue with time out that makes the scoring that is supposed to support the best fighting not working.  bot B get 100 score.

2011-06-30T02:19:28  <stocha> @later tell McLeopold so you are my last hope ...
2011-06-30T02:19:28  <contestbot> stocha: As you wish.
2011-06-30T02:19:36  <amstan> stocha: i'm not exactly sure what you mean though
2011-06-30T02:19:37  <janzert> hehe
2011-06-30T02:20:06  <amstan> stocha: are you talking about the scoring of a crashed/timed out bot? i think they should act like they're still part of the game but not sending any moves
2011-06-30T02:20:44  <janzert> he doesn't like that the last surviving ant is likely to win if all the other bots timeout
2011-06-30T02:20:51  <stocha> amstan: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=45689&user=107    Stocha should loose here. There is a lot of game like this with coward but wich go in a tiny part and do nothing. Then remain last, and the winning bot timeout.
2011-06-30T02:20:55  <janzert> at least that's my understanding
2011-06-30T02:21:06  <stocha> janzert: not all other bot timeout !!
2011-06-30T02:21:22  <antimatroid1> what, that ant gets the food bonus yes?
2011-06-30T02:21:23  <janzert> if all the other remaining ants timeout
2011-06-30T02:21:24  <stocha> janzert: all other bot are eliminated yet. (with big score). And only the winning bot timeout.
2011-06-30T02:21:25  <antimatroid1> what's wrong with that?
2011-06-30T02:21:52  <stocha> janzert: then the loosing bot sudendly becomes the winner. Although there is no chance of that but for the winning bot to timeout.
2011-06-30T02:22:04  <antimatroid1> stocha: 2 contests ago timing out got you disqualified from the contest
2011-06-30T02:22:14  <stocha> antimatroid1: it make the scoring system not coherent when the best best bot time out a few turn before wining.
2011-06-30T02:22:28  <janzert> the other bot should've been careful not to timeout then :}
2011-06-30T02:22:31  <amstan> yes, but since the game can continue if someone times out, i think it's only fair that their ants just stay frozen
2011-06-30T02:22:49  <mcstar> i think stocha doesnt realize that somebody must win
2011-06-30T02:22:52  <stocha> antimatroid: The problem is that either you should go with last bot win. Or with biggest scorte win. In that last case, don't make incoherent when best bot timeout.
2011-06-30T02:22:54  <janzert> amstan: yep, I don't think that is at issue at all
2011-06-30T02:22:55  <antimatroid1> amstan: the only reason the ants are left there is to try and not make the rest of the game too unfair
2011-06-30T02:23:19  <antimatroid1> stocha: it clearly wasn't the best bot in that game if it times out
2011-06-30T02:23:29  <stocha> janzert: the other bot didn't time out !!!!!!!!!
2011-06-30T02:23:44  <stocha> janzert: they were ELIMINATED with BIG SCORES.
2011-06-30T02:24:03  <stocha> so they should go 2d, 3rd 4th etc. And the loosing bot should be LAST in any cases.
2011-06-30T02:24:06  <mcstar> omg, you said it they were ELIMINATED
2011-06-30T02:24:16  <janzert> the other bot is sir_macelon in this case, not the rest of the field
2011-06-30T02:24:23  <stocha> here it receives the big bonus and wins.
2011-06-30T02:24:29  <amstan> i'm still unsure on what the problem is
2011-06-30T02:24:39  <stocha> janzert: janzert  the other bot was winning over stocha in this game
2011-06-30T02:24:48  <stocha> janzert: there was no way for stocha to catch up.
2011-06-30T02:24:52  <janzert> anyway I'm need to get to bed
2011-06-30T02:25:04  <stocha> Then this game is not the best example. But it happens a lot.
2011-06-30T02:25:46  <janzert> and like I said my preference would actually be that timed out bots got no points awarded
2011-06-30T02:26:02  <janzert> but I also don't want to change anything at this point
2011-06-30T02:26:17  <janzert> with the scoring that is
2011-06-30T02:26:52  <stocha> but the problem is not with time out bot. it's with the others bot. Especially that the loosing one get the bonus for winning. When it has not.
2011-06-30T02:28:59  <stocha> i guess i'l have to live with it, unless McLeopold somewhat sees the point.

2011-06-30T02:32:27  <mcstar> i call that incoherent with his words
2011-06-30T02:33:38  <mcstar> antimatroid1: im going to implement a* as well, then maybe ill use my own too if it works not too bad
2011-06-30T02:34:03  <antimatroid1> mcstar: that reminds me, i need to work out if my heuristic function is monotonic or whatever
2011-06-30T02:34:15  <antimatroid1> i have a feeling it's not, which means i don't think my implementation does enough
2011-06-30T02:34:31  <mcstar> isnt it the simple (manhattan?) distance?
2011-06-30T02:35:04  <antimatroid1> if i have a set of targets, then it's min_T mdist(x, T) where T are target locations
2011-06-30T02:35:04  <mcstar> i read thats totally ok
2011-06-30T02:35:24  <antimatroid1> and this is for h(x )
2011-06-30T02:36:38  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@120-49-80-78.tmcz.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-30T02:41:52  <mcstar> The h(x) part of the f(x) function must be an admissible heuristic; that is, it must not overestimate the distance to the goal. Thus, for an application like routing, h(x) might represent the straight-line distance to the goal, since that is physically the smallest possible distance between any two points or nodes.
2011-06-30T02:42:22  <mcstar> with your h, the distance cant be less than that, so its ok
2011-06-30T02:42:42  <antimatroid1> yes it's admissible
2011-06-30T02:42:52  <antimatroid1> the question i have is is it monotone
2011-06-30T02:42:54  <antimatroid1> i thin it is
2011-06-30T02:43:20  <antimatroid1> i'm curious of an example of an admissible nonmonotone heuristic function
2011-06-30T02:43:40  <mcstar> monotone in what? in the distance? since it is the distance it is monotone in itself
2011-06-30T02:44:00  <mcstar> just scale it up
2011-06-30T02:44:14  <antimatroid1> it says you need h(x) <= d(x,y) + h(y)
2011-06-30T02:44:16  <mcstar> c*d_min
2011-06-30T02:44:24  <antimatroid1> but i don't see how you can have an admissible function without that
2011-06-30T02:44:41  <antimatroid1> if your metric is all good with a metric space then you should be fine from the triangle inequality
2011-06-30T02:45:03  <antimatroid1> this is with multiple targets
2011-06-30T02:45:11  <mcstar> it might matter in what direction you travel
2011-06-30T02:45:19  <antimatroid1> but i don't understand what a non-monotone admissible heuristic would be?
2011-06-30T02:45:31  <mcstar> consider directed graph with different weight on edges travelling opposite directions ?
2011-06-30T02:45:48  <antimatroid1> ah yeah possibly
2011-06-30T02:45:52  <antimatroid1> negative edge weights too?
2011-06-30T02:45:55  <antimatroid1> or whatever
2011-06-30T02:46:03  <mcstar> maybe, not sure about that
2011-06-30T02:46:08  <antimatroid1> i'm not very knowledgeable on graph theory
2011-06-30T02:46:29  <mcstar> i think the problem doesnt change if you give a constant to all edge costs
2011-06-30T02:47:10  <antimatroid1> when i'm searching from food, i will add ants "locations" to the search queue, with g(x) = time they are available
2011-06-30T02:47:34  <antimatroid1> so if i collect food, the food square will become one of my sources for collecting more food, and g(x) := the turn the ant will be ready to start moving
2011-06-30T02:47:52  <antimatroid1> for* food
2011-06-30T02:48:44  <mcstar> hehe
2011-06-30T02:48:53  <mcstar> why not just use a meta a* search?
2011-06-30T02:49:00  <mcstar> one a* for pathfinding
2011-06-30T02:49:04  <antimatroid1> meta?
2011-06-30T02:49:11  <mcstar> another for searching among foods
2011-06-30T02:49:27  <mcstar> get what  i mean?
2011-06-30T02:49:27  <antimatroid1> nah, my method is cool :)
2011-06-30T02:49:44  <antimatroid1> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Astar_progress_animation.gif
2011-06-30T02:49:49  <antimatroid1> i'm a bit iffy about that animation
2011-06-30T02:49:59  <antimatroid1> it seems like they're doing a poor job of sorting the search queue
2011-06-30T02:50:05  <antimatroid1> you could minimise f and then h on a draw
2011-06-30T02:50:28  <antimatroid1> otherwise you search more than is necessary
2011-06-30T02:51:06  <antimatroid1> like, it searches way more than neccessary
2011-06-30T02:51:09  <antimatroid1> do you see what i mean?
2011-06-30T02:51:17  <mcstar> on the image the path can move diagonally
2011-06-30T02:51:23  <mcstar> no not really
2011-06-30T02:51:27  <antimatroid1> yes, doesn't matter
2011-06-30T02:51:58  <antimatroid1> it searches from the closest square to the source with equal f value, because that was the first one that was added to the search queue
2011-06-30T02:51:59  <mcstar> do you think on the image it touches too many nodes?
2011-06-30T02:52:21  <antimatroid1> but you should really search from the equal f valued location with the closest estimate to a target
2011-06-30T02:52:34  <antimatroid1> yes, more than necessary, but from the way it orders the search queue
2011-06-30T02:52:52  <mcstar> you dont ,like the way the open set i sgenerated?
2011-06-30T02:53:06  <antimatroid1> i don't like the way the priority queue is ordered
2011-06-30T02:53:44  <mcstar> did you visualize your search algorithm?
2011-06-30T02:54:15  <antimatroid1> (i think) it's ordered based off min f, where if f(x) == f(y), x<y if x was placed in the queue before y, whereas i would min f then min h, so if f(x) == f(y), the x<y if h(x) < h(y)
2011-06-30T02:55:03  <mcstar> you can easily sort the open set with the heuristic function
2011-06-30T02:55:27  <antimatroid1> i don't use open/closed set
2011-06-30T02:55:32  <antimatroid1> you don't need to if it's monotone
2011-06-30T02:55:48  <antimatroid1> just add search locations to the priority queue and mark it as visited
2011-06-30T02:55:51  <antimatroid1> then that's your search queue
2011-06-30T02:56:19  <mcstar> well, its the same
2011-06-30T02:56:33  <antimatroid1> yeah but this way is way simpler
2011-06-30T02:56:52  <mcstar> from an implementation point of view
2011-06-30T02:57:03  <antimatroid1> yeah, and thinking about it
2011-06-30T02:57:04  <mcstar> nevertheless, i will be more knowledgeable after i implement it
2011-06-30T02:57:23  <antimatroid1> my implementation is the same as i would do a bfs, except i order my queue
2011-06-30T02:57:29  <mcstar> so did you visualize what your alg. is doing?
2011-06-30T02:57:43  <antimatroid1> i debug the search path
2011-06-30T02:57:46  <antimatroid1> that's about it

2011-06-30T04:53:18  <stocha> mcstar: what i want it that a bot isn't given any bonus score, unless only his ants remains.
2011-06-30T04:53:27  <antimatroid1> "If a closed set is used, then h must also be monotonic (or consistent) for A* to be optimal", i would have thought that was if we don't use a closed set?
2011-06-30T04:53:58  <antimatroid1> stocha: so we should leave the game running and let the bot try and collct all the timet out ants?
2011-06-30T04:54:02  <antimatroid1> seems rather silly
2011-06-30T04:54:15  <antimatroid1> now* confused :P aha
2011-06-30T04:54:30  <stocha> antimatroid1: at least until it catch up with the others (non timed out eliminated ants)
2011-06-30T04:54:50  <stocha> antimatroid1: it's not more silly that what the actual system is doing.
2011-06-30T04:55:05  <stocha> antimatroid1: the other option is to go for reverse elimination order for the rank.
2011-06-30T04:55:15  <stocha> (which i belive janzert supports)
2011-06-30T04:56:59  <antimatroid1> mcstar: the part on the a* page about implementation details covers my concern from before i think
2011-06-30T04:57:04  <mcstar> stocha: timed-out or eliminated bots should get NO bonuses, thats my oppinion
2011-06-30T04:57:22  <stocha> mcstar: yeah. Who disagree with that ?
2011-06-30T04:57:38  <mcstar> and it seems fair that the only left player gets it
2011-06-30T04:58:01  <mcstar> maybe this is where we differ
2011-06-30T04:58:29  <stocha> mcstar: that's the point i disagree. If the last remaing player has 1 ant from the start of the game, and timedout has 5000. And the three eliminated had up to 1000 each, a few turn back.
2011-06-30T04:59:05  <stocha> mcstar: unless you go with reverse elimination order
2011-06-30T04:59:27  <stocha> Otherwise depending on when to bot timeout, the ranking is all different. That bothers me a lot.
2011-06-30T04:59:53  <mcstar> look, when the contest starts bot will not time out because of exhausted resources, or some llike that
2011-06-30T05:00:12  <mcstar> only because they are badly written, or they dont use timers
2011-06-30T05:00:32  <stocha> mcstar: what timing technology will be used ?
2011-06-30T05:00:39  <stocha> mcstar: on the server parts ?
2011-06-30T05:00:42  <mcstar> whatever you use in your program
2011-06-30T05:01:02  <mcstar> i mean timing out or crashing is unforgivable
2011-06-30T05:01:11  <stocha> mcstar: what prevent that a deamon server thread just don't give any time to the bot, so it times out ?
2011-06-30T05:01:56  <mcstar> im not the man to ask to question from
2011-06-30T05:02:08  <mcstar> to->those

2011-06-30T05:06:03  <stocha> mcstar: no she says that whenever i say something.
2011-06-30T05:06:11  <stocha> unless it's funny. Maybe.
2011-06-30T05:06:18  <mcstar> sorry to hear that :D
2011-06-30T05:06:39  <stocha> mcstar: at a point in my life, i din't speak much (if at all). It was not that bad.
2011-06-30T05:06:55  <stocha> maybe i was more clear, in a lot ways :)
2011-06-30T05:08:22  <stocha> Most probably, in any case, the impact of what bothers me will be limited. Game mecanics wise.  What worries me is that some people will complains how unfair the thing is. And they will be right (for one or two games over 100 )
2011-06-30T05:08:34  <stocha> Although it would certainly be a minor issue to solve the case.

2011-06-30T05:53:45  <stocha> @later tell McLeopold, i think there are now 3 map generators. RandomWalk, Octogonal and Maze. Why not close the map maping, and simply test with those 3 ? (Though it's possible to upgrade them, having more will make beta testing the map generator much more difficult i think)

2011-06-30T07:55:14  <antimatroid> yeah it's a path

2011-06-30T07:55:50  <antimatroid> yep okay
2011-06-30T07:56:10  <antimatroid> you should also highlight two other things
2011-06-30T07:56:20  <antimatroid> locations added to the search queue and locations taken off the search queue as well
2011-06-30T07:56:39  <mcstar> i will try to make a movie out of it
2011-06-30T07:56:49  <antimatroid> that would be sweet :)
2011-06-30T07:56:50  <mcstar> when i put it in my visualization framework
2011-06-30T07:56:56  <antimatroid> i would like to see  a movie of one with multiple targets
2011-06-30T07:57:03  <mcstar> but i soon have to go somewhere
2011-06-30T07:57:14  <mcstar> thats another story
2011-06-30T07:57:24  <antimatroid> it's really quite simple to do multiple targets
2011-06-30T07:57:40  <mcstar> yeah, but first i must speed up this one
2011-06-30T07:57:47  <mcstar> the implementation isnt optimal
2011-06-30T07:57:49  <antimatroid> what's so sow abou tit?

2011-06-30T07:57:57  <antimatroid> i'm not sure how else i could implement it

2011-06-30T08:01:51  <UncleVasya> Since refactor of my bot this system was broken.
2011-06-30T08:01:56  <antimatroid> mcstar: ^^ :P
2011-06-30T08:02:07  <UncleVasya> Usually it works this way:
2011-06-30T08:02:17  <UncleVasya> < 25 - avoiding enemies
2011-06-30T08:02:24  <mcstar> the first part is the uploading, the astar function is important
2011-06-30T08:02:55  <UncleVasya> 25 < 60  - not very strong attack
2011-06-30T08:02:58  <antimatroid> mcstar: imo it's better if people know their bot is being compared to each individual persons effort
2011-06-30T08:03:08  <UncleVasya> > 60 - strong attack
2011-06-30T08:03:09  <antimatroid> rather than how many people uploaded an instance of variation of a released bot
2011-06-30T08:03:16  <mcstar> antimatroid: i just read about sharing
2011-06-30T08:03:17  <antimatroid> or copied other peoples released code
2011-06-30T08:03:23  <antimatroid> it doesn't really matter :)
2011-06-30T08:03:25  <mcstar> well, its really a very general code
2011-06-30T08:03:34  <antimatroid> but in general i prefer to keep to that
2011-06-30T08:04:00  <antimatroid> that seemed to be the general consensus of people when code code released for pw anyway
2011-06-30T08:04:06  <antimatroid> i am fairly indifferent personally

2011-06-30T08:29:57  <antimatroid> i don't understand why you can't do the open/closed set way if the heuristic function isn't monotone, but you can use the ordinary prique methof
2011-06-30T08:30:10  <antimatroid> doesn't that sound counterintuitive? i would have expected it to be the other way around
2011-06-30T08:30:34  <mcstar> for example, the path is 273 long, and it touched 3877 tiles

2011-06-30T08:32:27  <mcstar> antimatroid: could you give me an approximation, that in similar circumstances how many nodes does your code visit before finding the path?
2011-06-30T08:32:55  <antimatroid> mcstar: not easily, i haven't got it open and would need to set it up to do just finding a path etc.

2011-06-30T10:03:08  <NielsE> aerique: but why didn't the food become an ant?
2011-06-30T10:03:19  <aerique> so you should basically treat such a square like water
2011-06-30T10:03:39  <NielsE> should I treat every food as water?
2011-06-30T10:03:58  <antimatroid> NielsE: it might be next to an ant that just spawned
2011-06-30T10:04:02  <aerique> NielsE: it's due to the order of ant moves and ant spawning in the engine
2011-06-30T10:04:05  <antimatroid> or it may have just spawned next to you?
2011-06-30T10:04:19  <sYnfo> Hmh, I've made a veeery slight modification to the Python3 started bot's ants.py to make it a liiitle bit more efficient, is there any way to modify the code on github? (Obv a newbie here :) )
2011-06-30T10:04:42  <antimatroid> sYnfo: the starter bots are really just a place for people to start
2011-06-30T10:04:58  <antimatroid> i usually rewrite my own one
2011-06-30T10:05:20  <antimatroid> although i wrote the c++ starter bot a lot like i structure my own bots normally, just a bit simpler in places
2011-06-30T10:05:25  <sYnfo> Even the ants.py? Ok, I thought people usually let that be :)
2011-06-30T10:05:36  <antimatroid> yeah i don't touch ants.py
2011-06-30T10:05:42  <antimatroid> but that doesn't affect your bot
2011-06-30T10:05:51  <sYnfo> Well
2011-06-30T10:05:54  <antimatroid> or maybe it does for the python bot?
2011-06-30T10:05:58  <sYnfo> No no no
2011-06-30T10:06:00  <antimatroid> i don't like python very much :P
2011-06-30T10:06:45  <sYnfo> My point is, if people don't touch the ants.py, any gain in efficiency in it will translate to more games played on the server, right?
2011-06-30T10:06:56  <sYnfo> I don't get you people, Python is awesome:P
2011-06-30T10:07:07  <antimatroid> i find it confusing to program in python
2011-06-30T10:07:25  <antimatroid> but the only programming i've ever really done in it is with the map generators for this, so i don't know it very well
2011-06-30T10:07:32  <antimatroid> c++ is so close to perfect :(
2011-06-30T10:07:32  <sYnfo> My friend feels the same, I on the other hand, not at all, python is a blessing for me
2011-06-30T10:07:39  <sYnfo> :)
2011-06-30T10:07:43  <sYnfo> Deppends I guess
2011-06-30T10:08:15  <NielsE> the beta site seems to have stopped working, it does not seem to do any games anymore

2011-06-30T11:03:10  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: non-monotonic heuristics are technically admissible i think but don't really work very well in my experience
2011-06-30T11:03:34  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: I can't even think of an example of one though?

2011-06-30T11:03:43  <a1k0n_> like you can have a function which has some penalty term added, and the penalty suddenly goes away when you reach some state
2011-06-30T11:03:52  <a1k0n_> but that doesn't "guide" the search at all
2011-06-30T11:03:53  <antimatroid> surely any kind of metric for a metric space is monotonic from the triangle inequality?

2011-06-30T11:04:40  <a1k0n_> but yeah, that's probably a good argument against trying anything like that
2011-06-30T11:05:08  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: the other thing that bugs me is the open/closed set implementation rather than just a priority queue (ordered queue), wikipedia says the non-monotonic one doesn't work for the open/closed set version, does that mean the open closed set version would be quicker with monotonic?
2011-06-30T11:05:16  <antimatroid> i would have expected it to be the other way around... :s
2011-06-30T11:05:22  <antimatroid> ah okay

2011-06-30T11:31:30  <a1k0n_> the closed set is just to handle the case where you already visited a node.. which.. yeah, probably wouldn't work with a nonmonotonic function
2011-06-30T11:31:40  <a1k0n_> but it speeds it up a lot on a grid-based thing
2011-06-30T11:32:54  <a1k0n_> but if you have, say, an "objective" of starting at point a, grabbing food at point b, and then going to point c, then, well, that should really be two searches, but if you wanted to do one, you'd have to know whether you already visited b at each state
2011-06-30T11:33:05  <a1k0n_> in which case the heuristic changes

2011-06-30T12:23:57  <McLeopold> no, it's for analysis only
2011-06-30T12:24:30  <McLeopold> I just want the visualizer to have a special map mode where it displays whatever the map actually looks like, ants, food, etc
2011-06-30T12:24:46  <McLeopold> without going through the setup for actually playing a game
2011-06-30T12:24:54  <olexs> maps with pre-placed food would be cool, though
2011-06-30T12:25:01  <olexs> I'll just say pacman :)
2011-06-30T12:25:25  <mleise> McLeopold: so... you want a more static version of it, right?
2011-06-30T12:25:40  <McLeopold> when checking symmetry, I want to place some random food and look at the results
2011-06-30T12:25:44  <McLeopold> right
2011-06-30T12:26:22  <McLeopold> I have no idea how much work that is.  It would only really be useful for the ant paste site right now
2011-06-30T12:27:56  <mleise> well, the cursor, and attack circles for example are drawn over ant positions. so for that to work I need all the ants as 'animation objects' with their 'current' coordinates
2011-06-30T12:28:12  <McLeopold> @later tell stocha scoring is not going to change, it is a compromise between surviving order, best food gatherer and best fighter
2011-06-30T12:28:12  <contestbot> McLeopold: Yep.
2011-06-30T12:28:17  <mleise> there is also the label option for color blind people
2011-06-30T12:28:31  <mleise> wich works on the same basis
2011-06-30T12:29:00  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-06-30T12:29:14  <McLeopold> so what's the slowdown?  creation of objects?
2011-06-30T12:30:02  <mleise> pass it through chrome's profiler :)
2011-06-30T12:30:06  <McLeopold> how about we get tricky, capitol letters won't be animated, lower case will?
2011-06-30T12:30:58  <mleise> There are no letters in my data. I just have 'owner' as an index starting at 0
2011-06-30T12:31:38  <mleise> unfortunately I redraw the whole map when the button tool tip changes ^^

2011-06-30T12:33:01  <mleise> you ask the wrong question son
2011-06-30T12:33:12  <mleise> the answer is 2 months though
2011-06-30T12:33:20  <mleise> most probably at least
2011-06-30T12:34:58  <fab0109> thanks you look like it will be my summer chalenge
2011-06-30T12:35:28  <mleise> fab0109: (it hasn't officially started yet)
2011-06-30T12:38:27  <mleise> McLeopold: First I get a list of all ants visible in the current turn (results are cached), then I calculate the effective coordinates with wrapping and map scrolling in mind, checking which ants are outside of the visible area and discarding those (has no effect when zoomed out of course)
2011-06-30T12:38:48  <McLeopold> can you skip visibillity when in map mode?
2011-06-30T12:39:23  <mleise> McLeopold: The remaining ants are drawn and their size (spawning ants pop up a bit) and location checked again for possible wrapping situations where they have to be drawn multiple times
2011-06-30T12:40:02  <mleise> McLeopold: you can zoom-in in map mode, so it is not obsolete
2011-06-30T12:41:53  <mleise> I'm currently on Windows and don't have Chrome installed. With a non-minified version of the JavaScript, it can be profiled pretty well.
2011-06-30T12:44:03  <McLeopold> k
2011-06-30T12:45:17  <mleise> ah you use the non-minified version already. ok :)
2011-06-30T12:46:23  <mleise> McLeopold: It will show either 'interpolate' or 'draw' as taking most of the time.

2011-06-30T14:01:37  <McLeopold> amstan: let me check
2011-06-30T14:02:00  <amstan> i tought we alreaday handled every kind of possible symmetry
2011-06-30T14:03:15  <McLeopold> amstan: let's just leave the issue, map generation may continue throughout the contest, it it is up to the one who write the generator to choose symmetries
2011-06-30T14:03:41  <amstan> also, do we really have to commit maps in the repo? it kinda makes everything messy
2011-06-30T14:03:46  <McLeopold> We can detect all symmetries that we can fairly spawn food on
2011-06-30T14:04:09  <amstan> maps should be up to the server admin to put in effect, it doesn't really have much to do with the code
2011-06-30T14:04:17  <McLeopold> amstan: no, we won't for launch, but I wanted the beta test maps in there
2011-06-30T14:04:34  <McLeopold> I just wanted a few with different types of symmetry as a test
2011-06-30T14:05:06  <McLeopold> We may want to include some generated maps in the tools.zip download?
2011-06-30T14:05:29  <McLeopold> or a utility to download official maps
2011-06-30T14:05:58  <amstan> i propose just a script that makes them
2011-06-30T14:06:10  <McLeopold> I'm working on that
2011-06-30T14:06:34  <amstan> and we shouldn't really encourage getting maps from the server, unless you have to debug for the one game your bot crashed in
2011-06-30T14:07:16  <McLeopold> why not?
2011-06-30T14:08:07  <amstan> the maps we provide should only be samples, they don't really have to have anything in common with the ones on the server
2011-06-30T14:08:31  <McLeopold> True, but some may still want to download them
2011-06-30T14:08:32  <amstan> we had this happen a few times, lots of outrage over map types
2011-06-30T14:08:46  <amstan> it should be understood that there's nothing about them that's special
2011-06-30T14:09:06  <amstan> if they want to download them they can analyze the json and get the map name and use the map/ url
2011-06-30T14:09:06  <McLeopold> But blocking access doesn't make sense
2011-06-30T14:09:21  <amstan> we're not blocking access, we're just not offering a tool
2011-06-30T14:09:36  <McLeopold> But why?  Are you worried about bandwidth?
2011-06-30T14:09:36  <amstan> oh, they can also look in the replay, the map is listed there right?
2011-06-30T14:10:15  <McLeopold> Are you worried that some will only test on official maps and then complain that they weren't a fair sample?
2011-06-30T14:10:27  <amstan> no, but it's extra work for not much gain
2011-06-30T14:10:48  <amstan> McLeopold: partially, yes
2011-06-30T14:11:27  <McLeopold> I believe opening up the contest as much as possible and providing the best tools for what people want is the best policy.
2011-06-30T14:11:41  <McLeopold> And *I* want to be able to download officially used maps.
2011-06-30T14:12:04  <amstan> if you really want to make a tool, go for it
2011-06-30T14:12:08  <McLeopold> I don't want to guide the contest based on if people might complain
2011-06-30T14:12:17  <amstan> but i don't think it's important
2011-06-30T14:12:23  <McLeopold> ok, after launch
2011-06-30T14:12:50  <amstan> also, keep in mind the ammount of tools that will be made during the contest
2011-06-30T14:13:01  <amstan> someone might make it themselves
2011-06-30T14:13:04  <McLeopold> btw, the tool I used to generate new maps on the server would be about the same that users would use for their own map generation
2011-06-30T14:13:13  <amstan> yes, i know

I just want that the last remaining bot doesn't get the bonus if it isn't the last remaining bot (one or more timedout bot): the game should playout normaly.    However i more worryed about the map policy. Maps should be genarated with fixed rules that don't evolve after beta. They should be random for each map, with a fair seed. And the map generator have to

2011-06-30T16:05:51  <janzert> ok, it sounds pretty early to me but might as well try it
2011-06-30T16:06:03  <McLeopold> 66 is now

2011-06-30T16:09:04  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-30T16:09:29  <McLeopold> do you have a howto on spinning up a new worker or taking one down?
2011-06-30T16:09:51  <janzert> also so amstan knows the reason he couldn't get access at first with them was jeff had used a different ssh key we didn't have
2011-06-30T16:10:01  <McLeopold> oh
2011-06-30T16:10:16  <janzert> amstan can look in the bash history on the contest user on jeff's server
2011-06-30T16:10:20  <McLeopold> so amstan can spin up a new worker?
2011-06-30T16:10:23  <janzert> all the commands are there
2011-06-30T16:11:23  <janzert> basic overview is, you have to sudo to the contest user, then run the ~/ec2-check/ec2-env.sh to set up the ec2 access for the ec2 scripts
2011-06-30T16:12:08  <janzert> the ec2-describe-instances will list the current instances, the instance name that looks like i-hexnumber is the important part
2011-06-30T16:12:23  <janzert> then use ec2-terminate-instance to get ec2 to kill and start a new worker
2011-06-30T16:12:43  <janzert> or ec2-describe-spot-instance-requests to list the current requests
2011-06-30T16:13:02  <janzert> and ec2-cancel-spot-instance-request to cancel them
2011-06-30T16:13:18  <janzert> I don't remember the full command to create a new request but it'll be in the history
2011-06-30T16:13:39  <McLeopold> you manager ec2 instances from command line?
2011-06-30T16:13:51  <janzert> for jeff's account I do :)
2011-06-30T16:14:06  <janzert> don't have his ec2 login details to access the web page
2011-06-30T16:14:34  <janzert> also you can look at http://cloudexchange.org/charts/us-east-1.linux.m2.xlarge.html to see the current spot price
2011-06-30T16:14:47  <janzert> if it's above 0.20 that's why you don't have any workers :/
2011-06-30T16:15:22  <jbroman> Are the m2.xlarge instances that much more effective than the m1.s? We can actually run 5 times as many games?
2011-06-30T16:15:28  <janzert> supposedly the hotel I'll be at has internet access so after tomorrow evening I should be able to check in
2011-06-30T16:15:53  <jbroman> (I'm not sure; I just would've thought that it would've been cheaper on the smaller instances.)
2011-06-30T16:15:56  <janzert> jbroman: look at the memory size
2011-06-30T16:16:24  <janzert> we can't run any games with more than 2 players on m1.small and that would be tight
2011-06-30T16:16:51  <janzert> also we'd probably get lots of complaints about the slow cpu speed
2011-06-30T16:18:02  <janzert> http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ has the specs btw
2011-06-30T16:18:04  <McLeopold> those prices have odd spikes
2011-06-30T16:18:06  <jbroman> janzert: Oh, I didn't realize that players were getting on the order of a gigabyte or two of memory.
2011-06-30T16:18:10  * jbroman (I've seen the specs before.)
2011-06-30T16:18:36  <janzert> yeah, java starts throwing fits when you try and reduce it much below 1GB :(
2011-06-30T16:18:44  <jbroman> Aww.
2011-06-30T16:18:56  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah, the last 48 hours has been weird with the spot pricing
2011-06-30T16:19:38  <janzert> seems to happen about once a month although this was longer spikyness(?) than usual

2011-06-30T16:34:06  <stocha> janzert: it's not necessarily that the map has lower skill separation. It might be that the bots features where well tuned for the older maps (no starting proximity especially, and low reward for exploration, small maps)

2011-06-30T17:39:54  <mleise> McLeopold: would there be a reason for cetain squares on a map to spawn more food than others?
2011-06-30T17:40:18  <McLeopold> there shouldn
2011-06-30T17:40:21  <McLeopold> 't be
2011-06-30T17:40:44  <McLeopold> all land squares are divided into symmetric sets
2011-06-30T17:41:03  <McLeopold> each square should spawn food at least once before any squares spawns twice
2011-06-30T17:41:24  <mleise> McLeopold: oh really? i didn't know that!
2011-06-30T17:41:50  <hacklash> so a square is less likely to have food on it if it just had food spawn there?
2011-06-30T17:42:33  <McLeopold> yes
2011-06-30T17:44:21  <mleise> but that may be several 1000 squares so it would be hard to predict in the important start phase where food will spawn
2011-06-30T17:44:52  <McLeopold> if you can explore the entire map, then apply the symmetric_food_sets function to it, then track where food has been spawned and detect the turn where the sets are shuffelled, then you *might* get an advantage
2011-06-30T17:45:11  <McLeopold> after turn 1000
2011-06-30T17:46:03  <McLeopold> the thought has always been that by the time you can use food spawn and map symmetry information to your advantage, it might be too late

2011-06-30T18:02:34  <McLeopold> If you can predict where food will spawn, make sure not to have an ant on that spot, because it won't spawn of not free, just wait for the ant to move
2011-06-30T18:13:40  <hacklash> oh, was a max board size ever decided on?

2011-06-30T18:18:36  <hacklash> i had the crazy idea of caching the pathfinding  but estimated that total size of that would grow to about 4 GB, a tad too large to be practical
2011-06-30T18:19:04  <mcstar> 1sec per turn also
2011-06-30T18:19:21  <mcstar> searching in a 4gb hashtable takes time...
2011-06-30T18:19:30  <hacklash> you keep that in memory between turns so you don't have to recalculate paths you've already found
2011-06-30T18:20:00  <McLeopold> hacklash: maybe keep the last 1000 or so
2011-06-30T18:20:56  <hacklash> wait... getting the value out of a large hashtable is slow?
2011-06-30T18:21:21  <hacklash> that doesn't sound right
2011-06-30T18:21:56  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@120-49-80-78.tmcz.cz> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-06-30T18:22:26  <hacklash> mcstar: care to explain?
2011-06-30T18:22:35  <mcstar> well, you must use long hashes with that kind of amount of paths
2011-06-30T18:22:54  <mcstar> i dont know numbers, but i guess its very large
2011-06-30T18:23:15  <mcstar> do you have experience with that large hashtables?
2011-06-30T18:23:39  <hacklash> no
2011-06-30T18:23:41  <mcstar> you have to take into account re-hashing
2011-06-30T18:23:42  <hacklash> that's why i asked
2011-06-30T18:23:48  <mcstar> which takes time
2011-06-30T18:24:07  <mcstar> a hash-key only works for a certain amount of hashed values
2011-06-30T18:24:08  <hacklash> if you know how big it's going to be yiou can intialize with the coprrect size and prevent re-hashing
2011-06-30T18:24:16  <hacklash> which yhou could do if you knoew the board size
2011-06-30T18:24:19  <mcstar> when the table gets bigger you have to re-hash everything
2011-06-30T18:24:35  <mcstar> and it could easily take more time than 1 sec i guess
2011-06-30T18:24:51  <mcstar> but a longer key takes longer to find
2011-06-30T18:25:07  <mcstar> there's no free lunch so to speak
2011-06-30T18:25:16  <hacklash> see, i don't get that part
2011-06-30T18:25:34  <hacklash> it should just be a mod operation and a jump instruction
2011-06-30T18:26:19  <hacklash> if the hashtable is adjacent in memory
2011-06-30T18:27:43  <hacklash> is that wrong?
2011-06-30T18:27:45  <mcstar> you want to hash pointers?
2011-06-30T18:27:50  <mcstar> thats good i guess
2011-06-30T18:28:21  <mcstar> obviously you always hash pointers....
2011-06-30T18:28:25  <mcstar> doestn matter
2011-06-30T18:28:54  <mcstar> what i think, is that its easier to generaTE paths
2011-06-30T18:29:01  <mcstar> than storing them like this
2011-06-30T18:29:04  <mcstar> isnt it?
2011-06-30T18:29:23  <hacklash> generating is not much worse
2011-06-30T18:29:56  <mcstar> theres only a small chance that i want go from A to B more than once
2011-06-30T18:30:00  <hacklash> and much cheaper on memory that you need to keep initialized
2011-06-30T18:30:11  <mcstar> so i dont get the point why not just generate a new path every time
2011-06-30T18:31:01  <mcstar> i guess you already keep a copy of the explored map right?

2011-06-30T18:50:24  <mleise> hacklash said boolean array. so boolean must be some kind of object in that language
2011-06-30T18:50:34  <mleise> ot it uses "variants"

2011-06-30T19:00:53  <mcstar> the video? thats easy, xvidcap
2011-06-30T19:01:55  <mcstar> has a little gui, you can select a rectangle you want to record
2011-06-30T19:02:20  <mcstar> but i forgot the command to mencoder and it seems its not in my path, so i left it in mpeg
2011-06-30T19:02:53  <mleise> ok, nice demo. the first version looks seriously flawed :p
2011-06-30T19:03:33  <mcstar> yeah :S
2011-06-30T19:03:59  <mcstar> of course the visualization has nothing to do with xvidcap, its only for recording the window

2011-06-30T19:08:28  <mleise> it is a good test case with the solid line in the center
2011-06-30T19:09:07  <mleise> and it makes me wonder if the big red area could be skipped heuristically
2011-06-30T19:09:22  <mcstar> yeah, ill put in it my map-loader function so that i can load up ants maps
2011-06-30T19:10:02  <mcstar> welll maybe
2011-06-30T19:10:22  <mcstar> the thing is: i dont think i need better heuristics
2011-06-30T19:10:29  <mcstar> the maps wont be soo random
2011-06-30T19:10:48  <mcstar> and the planned paths will be much much shorter than the presented one
2011-06-30T19:11:28  <mcstar> and, yes
2011-06-30T19:11:46  <mcstar> before this, i tried to come up with my own "heuristic" pathfinding
2011-06-30T19:12:02  <mcstar> i computed the outlines of individual connected areas of water
2011-06-30T19:12:18  <mcstar> and i simply walked the map, until i hit such an outline
2011-06-30T19:12:40  <mcstar> then, i did a little bit of breadth first search, in the outline, which is not much
2011-06-30T19:12:55  <mcstar> and followed it until an exit condition presented itself
2011-06-30T19:13:11  <mcstar> namely the ant reached the tile in the outline closest to the target
2011-06-30T19:13:27  <mcstar> and i think this can be combined with a* heuristics
2011-06-30T19:14:11  <mcstar> maybe i should give points in the open set(white) higher priority when  they are part of such an outline
2011-06-30T19:14:34  <mcstar> but in the ants game it wouldn make much difference
2011-06-30T19:15:15  <mcstar> t
2011-06-30T19:16:25  <mleise> right
2011-06-30T19:17:00  <mleise> I had the outline generation for the visualizer, when I was working on rendering coast-lines
2011-06-30T19:18:27  <mleise> But with the current map sizes it takes to long to render the whole map and it still looked pretty boring with only one terrain texture
2011-06-30T19:19:29  <mcstar> but computing the outline is fast
2011-06-30T19:19:51  <mcstar> so was it supposed to be eyecandy?
2011-06-30T19:19:58  <mleise> hehe, that's true even in slower JavaScript implementations.
2011-06-30T19:20:22  <mleise> But I rendered the outline as a shadow (blurred)
2011-06-30T19:20:36  <mleise> to use it as the base for the coast-line effect
2011-06-30T19:20:57  <mcstar> for me its better not to see such frills
2011-06-30T19:21:20  <mcstar> if ants are little squares i dont need coastlines :)
2011-06-30T19:22:16  <mleise> Sure, for debugging it is horrible: soft coast-lines, ants and food as graphics.
2011-06-30T19:23:47  <mleise> If someone was asking for more immersion that would be the ideal place for the eye-candy-mode. But as I couldn't make it good looking enough within certain computational time constraints I never finished that mode.
