2011-04-13T01:41:14  <Stocha> what about officially trying a fighting rule ?
2011-04-13T01:41:32  <Stocha> anything will do as long as it is official
2011-04-13T01:46:51  <Stocha> more and more people are starting to build bot. It would be good if the "we have no idea what rules could be accepted by jeff" could be lifted a bit.

2011-04-13T07:17:50  <namina> ok, no worries
2011-04-13T07:17:53  <antimatroid> surely it'd be something like y[n+c] = ____ similar

2011-04-13T07:19:35  <namina> I guess you add something to input and output changes similarly?
2011-04-13T07:20:45  <antimatroid> yeah, the idea is something is invariant under some kind of "transformation" if you can transform the input and leave the output unchanged

2011-04-13T07:40:41  <Ice_Harley> antimatroid: sorry, I was busy. What do you mean "avoiding "collisions" with paths"?
2011-04-13T07:41:45  <antimatroid> Ice_Harley: say you iteratively move an ant to a food square, then you want to send another ant through that path, you don't want to think the shortest path will consist of having two ants in the same square at once
2011-04-13T07:42:27  <antimatroid> that isn't as important for food collection as it is diverting ants to get close to battles
2011-04-13T07:44:06  <antimatroid> i imagine i'll end up using a set of tuplets (turns, location, taken) to do that
2011-04-13T07:44:47  <antimatroid> i have a 4-tuple with my food collection queue :\
2011-04-13T07:44:59  <Ice_Harley> antimatroid: when I say "iteratively" I mean one iteration - one food collect. It's not all ant steps to food, it's just fact - ant goes to food
2011-04-13T07:45:38  <antimatroid> Ice_Harley: what would you method do here:
2011-04-13T07:45:39  <antimatroid> *..a...*
2011-04-13T07:45:39  <antimatroid> *..a...*
2011-04-13T07:45:50  <antimatroid> i would send one ant left and one ant right
2011-04-13T07:47:55  <Ice_Harley> antimatroid: first iteration: found closest food (left upper one for example). Send upper ant for it. Second Iteration: found closest food - left down one. Send upper ant for it. Third - closest food is right one. Send second ant for it - he is closer
2011-04-13T07:48:06  <antimatroid> i can't think of a good general method to do the following optimally:
2011-04-13T07:48:07  <antimatroid> b....*...a..*
2011-04-13T07:49:12  <antimatroid> you risk doing stuff very sub optimally if you go for food closest to an enemy that you can reach first
2011-04-13T07:50:13  <Ice_Harley> it's an option to test. Maybe it doesn't matter till my ant and enemy ant will die together
2011-04-13T07:52:44  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/QKsT6ykF
2011-04-13T07:53:00  <antimatroid> check that example, i think that gives a situation where i currently would get distances wrong

2011-04-13T07:54:55  <Ice_Harley> to "eat" food bottom ant should go up-up-left - 3 steps
2011-04-13T07:55:03  <antimatroid> but it's certainly something i want to worry about with other things
2011-04-13T07:55:16  <antimatroid> yes, but what if spawn radius was 1?
2011-04-13T07:55:41  <antimatroid> i'm trying to point out where i think it might give the wrong results, even if this example doesn't work with the current parameters
2011-04-13T07:56:20  <antimatroid> due to moving the closest ant to a food square, it's not quite as obvious that it's breakable, but i'm pretty sure it is
2011-04-13T07:57:39  <Ice_Harley> I think i understand you.
2011-04-13T08:01:25  <needsch> i wonder why only water cells are sent to the bots (whenever the fog of war is lifted a little more).
2011-04-13T08:02:07  <needsch> is that by purpose or may it be subject to change?
2011-04-13T08:04:11  <antimatroid> it was to minimise io data
2011-04-13T08:04:17  <antimatroid> it is very unlikely that it will change
2011-04-13T08:05:25  <needsch> yeah, i wonder whether that'll pay off well. because every bot author has to worry about updating his local map accordingly. i.e. find out what cells can be assumed to be LAND/FLOOR because they should be visible by now, too.
2011-04-13T08:05:27  <antimatroid> i was against it, so much information is now only implicitly given

2011-04-13T10:21:53  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2011-04-13T10:33:29  <antimatroid> amstan: we need jeff
2011-04-13T10:35:41  <amstan> antimatroid: have you talked to mcleopold about the issues you want to solve with jeff?
2011-04-13T10:35:44  <amstan> can't he solve them?
2011-04-13T10:35:58  <antimatroid> mcleopold can decide battle if you want
2011-04-13T10:36:09  <antimatroid> but i was under the impression jeff was going to make that call
2011-04-13T10:36:26  <amstan> ok.. what issues are we talking about?
2011-04-13T10:36:31  <antimatroid> battle resolution
2011-04-13T10:36:33  <amstan> i need a list
2011-04-13T10:36:37  <antimatroid> i want mcleopold to have the right to make other decisions
2011-04-13T10:36:47  <janzert> amstan: the reason things have been left hanging is that jeff took a fairly strong position on them last time he was around that was different than what everyone else though
2011-04-13T10:36:50  <janzert> thought
2011-04-13T10:37:14  <antimatroid> or you or janzert
2011-04-13T10:37:20  <antimatroid> someone that is around often enough
2011-04-13T10:37:23  <amstan> ok, so we have to get him then
2011-04-13T10:37:32  <amstan> but i need to know everything that he needs to decide
2011-04-13T10:37:37  <antimatroid> but battle is the big decision
2011-04-13T10:38:04  <antimatroid> battle, i think we are fine to make the other decisions, although it would be good if jeff would okay mcleopold (or one of you two) to have the ruling decision
2011-04-13T10:39:21  <amstan> does mcleopold still want to compete?
2011-04-13T10:39:32  <antimatroid> i think so
2011-04-13T10:39:40  <antimatroid> i was going to say it'd probably be better as one of you two
2011-04-13T10:39:55  <amstan> yeah... some people might not want contestants to decide on rules
2011-04-13T10:40:14  <antimatroid> if janzert was willing he'd possibly be the most suitable
2011-04-13T10:40:17  <amstan> but like.. i don't want to do this since i'm still unclear about the choices
2011-04-13T10:40:30  <amstan> janzert: wanna have such a role?
2011-04-13T10:40:36  <amstan> antimatroid: i still need a list of what needs to be decided
2011-04-13T10:40:53  <antimatroid> amstan: from jeff, it's really just battle, everything else is fine i think
2011-04-13T10:41:09  <amstan> ok... i need to more know than just "battle"
2011-04-13T10:41:14  <janzert> I don't mind but I'm going to be around much less for the next couple of months
2011-04-13T10:41:17  <amstan> did you have a page explaining the options
2011-04-13T10:41:22  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Battle-Resolution-Options
2011-04-13T10:41:31  <janzert> probably still around some, but much less active
2011-04-13T10:41:53  <antimatroid> janzert: yeah, it's really only to have someone we can talk to to make a decision if people are really at odds
2011-04-13T10:42:01  <antimatroid> we can always pull jeff in if we can't find you
2011-04-13T10:42:36  <antimatroid> sigh is another option
2011-04-13T10:42:39  <janzert> finding someone who can do the main system administration is going to be critical for this as well
2011-04-13T10:42:40  <antimatroid> i don't think he'll be competing
2011-04-13T10:42:52  <antimatroid> but neither of them are options for system admin
2011-04-13T10:43:33  <amstan> i can do some stuff around there, i could probably setup the contest too, but it might crash
2011-04-13T10:43:45  <antimatroid> .. that would be bad :P
2011-04-13T10:43:48  <amstan> yes
2011-04-13T10:44:08  <amstan> there were some moments where janzert saved us, idk if i would do good in those situations
2011-04-13T10:44:31  <antimatroid> yeah, we need an equivalent janzert
2011-04-13T10:44:51  <antimatroid> we could ask reddit?
2011-04-13T10:44:56  <amstan> jbroman is an equivalent janzert, but he probably doesn't want this
2011-04-13T10:45:03  <amstan> antimatroid: it should be someone trusted by us
2011-04-13T10:45:10  <amstan> idk if randomly going on reddit for this is a good idea
2011-04-13T10:45:15  <antimatroid> pretty sure jbroman has already been offered the position
2011-04-13T10:45:25  <jbroman> Well, I just don't know enough about how epsilon works to know how hard it is to keep it running.
2011-04-13T10:45:50  <antimatroid> it would be more a, "we're looking for someone that can do this", if we don't find anyone, no real loss
2011-04-13T10:46:03  <jbroman> I can certainly be around as much as time permits; I just can't promise that I'll know what's wrong when compile_a_bot_and_stuff.py fails.
2011-04-13T10:46:22  <amstan> antimatroid: my point is that we might find some people that volunteer but are sketchy
2011-04-13T10:46:36  <antimatroid> yeah fair call
2011-04-13T10:46:42  <antimatroid> can already happen now, but not as likely
2011-04-13T10:46:46  <jbroman> antimatroid: I'm a little skeptical about arbitrarily asking "Hey, want root on our systems?"
2011-04-13T10:47:42  <antimatroid> jbroman: you would potentially be able to bug janzert a little bit :P
2011-04-13T10:47:43  <amstan> on reddit..
2011-04-13T10:48:36  <jbroman> antimatroid: Could well be good enough. The "moderate number of people each with some time and expertise" approach works well for the CSC.
2011-04-13T10:50:15  <jbroman> Until May, I won't be in IRC by day (due to work), but once school starts again I'll at least be more present.
2011-04-13T10:50:33  <antimatroid> i think most people are out during the day for their local time
2011-04-13T10:50:47  <jbroman> Ah right, I forgot that the definition of "day" varies.
2011-04-13T10:51:00  <antimatroid> if i get accepted for gsoc, i'm going to be quite busy with that and uni

2011-04-13T10:59:05  <amstan> he might not be available to come over for a week
2011-04-13T10:59:39  <antimatroid> hmmm.. that's really too long
2011-04-13T10:59:51  <antimatroid> can you ask him to either read the page and make a decision or let someone else make the decision
2011-04-13T11:00:11  <antimatroid> it would be good if he was at least told that almost everyone prefers damage to the other options
2011-04-13T11:00:18  <antimatroid> and that people are able to understand it
2011-04-13T11:05:57  <amstan> antimatroid: you here at 10pm, in 11 hours?
2011-04-13T11:06:21  <amstan> he'll come over then
2011-04-13T11:06:32  <antimatroid> i'll be at uni then
2011-04-13T11:06:41  <amstan> ok.. suggest a better time
2011-04-13T11:06:44  <amstan> +-2 hours?
2011-04-13T11:06:59  <amstan> actually.. hmm midnight will probably not work for jeff
2011-04-13T11:07:11  <antimatroid> it would need to be even later
2011-04-13T11:07:28  <amstan> what about 8? in 9 hours
2011-04-13T11:08:15  <antimatroid> how about if i send him an email?
2011-04-13T11:08:28  <antimatroid> it's 1am, i start uni at 9am :P
2011-04-13T11:08:33  <amstan> ok, do that then

2011-04-13T22:18:05  <janzert> welcome back :}
2011-04-13T22:18:58  <j3camero> Thanks! I am in Florida right now, using shaky beach wireless. I may cut in and out.
2011-04-13T22:20:35  <janzert> unfortunately I think antimatroid and mcleopold are the two that have the most they want to run by you
2011-04-13T22:20:59  <janzert> I think antimatroid fired off an email to you earlier though
2011-04-13T22:21:21  <McLeopold> who's running this meeting?
2011-04-13T22:21:30  <janzert> I'm only hanging around the edges since work is picking up here again
2011-04-13T22:21:34  <j3camero> So right now we're picking the battle resolution logic that we're going to open the next contest with. Everybody who's going to vote, quickly take a look at https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Battle-Resolution-Options and weigh in with which methods you like. You can vote for more than one, all of them, or none at all. Whichever has the most votes, we'll go with.
2011-04-13T22:21:45  <janzert> damage
2011-04-13T22:21:50  <sigh> damage
2011-04-13T22:22:09  <sigh> antimatroid votes damage too :P
2011-04-13T22:22:19  <McLeopold> damage
2011-04-13T22:24:16  <McLeopold> Antimatroid and I are prepared to write something to eliminate small choke points in maps so that blocking doesn't become too bad
2011-04-13T22:24:20  <j3camero> Cool. So far I have

2011-04-13T22:24:36  <j3camero> Anybody else voting before we make the decision?
2011-04-13T22:24:42  <j3camero> amstan?
2011-04-13T22:24:52  <amstan> for score?
2011-04-13T22:25:01  <jbroman> amstan: battle
2011-04-13T22:25:04  <janzert> no dying
2011-04-13T22:25:19  <amstan> yeah, i'll go with damage
2011-04-13T22:25:56  <j3camero> Okay. We'll wait another few minutes in case anyone else wants to get on the record. Failing a large influx of people, it looks like we're going with the damage option!
2011-04-13T22:26:33  <jbroman> History will remember this as the most decisive five minutes in #aichallenge history.
2011-04-13T22:26:52  <janzert> :)
2011-04-13T22:26:57  <McLeopold> so, what's next, review of issues?
2011-04-13T22:26:58  <amstan> lol
2011-04-13T22:27:32  <j3camero> Yes, for sure.
2011-04-13T22:27:39  <ahmedhelal> damage
2011-04-13T22:27:41  <janzert> is there anything else that we need j3camero for though first?
2011-04-13T22:27:47  <j3camero> McLeopold, I'm sure you probably have a bunch to say.
2011-04-13T22:27:52  <sigh> has the scoring system been settled yet?
2011-04-13T22:28:00  <McLeopold> sigh: it was never not settled
2011-04-13T22:28:10  <janzert> not at all
2011-04-13T22:28:15  <sigh> so the food bonus stuff is locked in?
2011-04-13T22:28:50  <amstan> there was a poll on the forums about that: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1364 . people seem inclined to want points for killing ants and number of ants alive at the end
2011-04-13T22:28:51  <McLeopold> j3camero: Actually, I don't have much to say about the current state of things.  Except, we need someone doing a server build every so often to ensure we have a working set of code.
2011-04-13T22:28:54  <j3camero> Food bonus system is cool with me. If it ends up totally sucking, that should become clear soon after launch. Shouldn't be too hard to fix it.
2011-04-13T22:29:05  <janzert> hmm, I meant it wasn't settled but that is just because I don't think we can know if it works or not without a fair number of games for people to go over
2011-04-13T22:29:35  <sigh> cool, I was just clarifying to check if it was something we needed to go over now
2011-04-13T22:29:51  <sigh> but seems we can leave it
2011-04-13T22:30:11  <j3camero> McLeopold: re server builds. If we set up a buildbot server or other continuous integration system, would that do the trick?
2011-04-13T22:30:13  <janzert> if we do have a beta period that should give a good chance for it to shake out
2011-04-13T22:30:19  <McLeopold> I think the current scoring is good as it is.  We will need to wait until after beta to see if it needs to be tweaked.
2011-04-13T22:30:43  <janzert> does the code actually function end-to-end at this point?
2011-04-13T22:30:59  <McLeopold> j3camero: that sounds like a good idea.  It should also create an entry for each starter pack and example bot and run games.
2011-04-13T22:31:03  <janzert> I didn't know pairing was functional yet
2011-04-13T22:31:12  <McLeopold> janzert: I know it doesn't right now
2011-04-13T22:31:37  <McLeopold> pairing is the last big piece, and then fixing everything that broke with the schema change
2011-04-13T22:31:55  *** Stocha <Stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-13T22:32:02  <janzert> yeah, I've been waiting for that to even attempt a full setup
2011-04-13T22:32:02  <McLeopold> I have some website-php issues I'd like to hand off to someone.
2011-04-13T22:32:10  <amstan> McLeopold: which one?
2011-04-13T22:32:35  <j3camero> McLeopold: do we know how the pairing algorithm is going to work yet?
2011-04-13T22:32:42  <McLeopold> #53
2011-04-13T22:32:46  <Stocha> damage !
2011-04-13T22:33:12  <McLeopold> j3camero: yes, the pairing works right now, with a trueskill approximation for match quality
2011-04-13T22:33:12  <amstan> McLeopold: that's php? seems like a cronjob task for me
2011-04-13T22:33:41  <McLeopold> amstan: it is, but the leader board php files need to be updated to the new schema
2011-04-13T22:33:59  <j3camero> McLeopold: okay nice. I don;t know the algorithm details for that. Is it relatively feasible?
2011-04-13T22:34:01  <McLeopold> pairing is going to happen real time to provide the best matches possible
2011-04-13T22:34:03  <amstan> McLeopold: ok, i'll look over it
2011-04-13T22:34:38  <McLeopold> pairing is done in an sql procedure https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/sql/2_generate_matchup.sql
2011-04-13T22:34:39  <Stocha> we need someone with the power of making small choices i guess.
2011-04-13T22:34:53  <Stocha> so that matters are settled more quickly now
2011-04-13T22:35:12  <janzert> we need a BDFC (Benevolent Dictator For the Contest) ;)
2011-04-13T22:35:23  <McLeopold> So, the part left for pairing is updating the sigma and mu after a match completes
2011-04-13T22:35:54  <McLeopold> which is pretty easy, I'm working on that tonight
2011-04-13T22:35:58  <janzert> or BDFA (Benevolent Dictator For Ants) rather
2011-04-13T22:36:11  <Stocha> some expressed to me some concern about the trueskill precision and multiplayers games. He didn't give any detail though.
2011-04-13T22:36:18  <Stocha> someone
2011-04-13T22:36:41  <janzert> Stocha: Trueskill was first used for multiplayer games
2011-04-13T22:37:05  <McLeopold> It's a matter of fine tuning the beta, which we can't do until after our beta run of games
2011-04-13T22:37:28  <Stocha> He said he knew true skill, and that there would be problems. But didn't give any detail :p
2011-04-13T22:37:36  <j3camero> I think that having a dictator for technical matters is a good idea. I propose the following: if amstan, janzert, and McLeopold achieve consensus on a technical issue, then it is decided. Is that okay with everyone?
2011-04-13T22:37:47  <McLeopold> yes
2011-04-13T22:37:49  <amstan> yes
2011-04-13T22:38:01  <Stocha> it's okay to me also :p
2011-04-13T22:38:06  <janzert> I'd prefer one person with final say, but...
2011-04-13T22:38:20  <Stocha> three persons consensus is more stable
2011-04-13T22:38:20  <McLeopold> Then I'll always vote last :)
2011-04-13T22:38:44  <amstan> McLeopold: assuming janzert and me disagree
2011-04-13T22:38:48  <amstan> lol
2011-04-13T22:38:53  <j3camero> The triumvirate scheme that I propose is meant to eliminate myself as a decision bottleneck, which I know is annoying to people.
2011-04-13T22:38:53  <janzert> :)
2011-04-13T22:39:11  <McLeopold> no, it would be unanimous or we don't do it
2011-04-13T22:39:28  <j3camero> Yep. It's gotta be unanimous.
2011-04-13T22:39:32  <Stocha> i think it's good
2011-04-13T22:39:39  <Stocha> if things go wrong, you'll need j3camero
2011-04-13T22:39:40  <janzert> we really, really need a sysadmin for ants
2011-04-13T22:39:45  <McLeopold> unless no decision is a decision, then it's whatever wins
2011-04-13T22:39:53  <amstan> j3camero: in the agenda we still have: finding an admin, launch date, money, reminder about issue assignments, pick one!
2011-04-13T22:40:44  <McLeopold> amstan: what happened to the launch tag in github issues?
2011-04-13T22:41:06  <amstan> McLeopold: it's a milestone now
2011-04-13T22:41:11  <janzert> it's a milestone now?
2011-04-13T22:41:12  <McLeopold> ah
2011-04-13T22:41:26  <amstan> McLeopold: we should use those more often, they go late when we're late
2011-04-13T22:41:31  <McLeopold> 16 days!?
2011-04-13T22:41:33  <amstan> red*
2011-04-13T22:41:39  <amstan> McLeopold: so.. ignore that
2011-04-13T22:41:41  <Stocha> I think if matters are clear, you'll all 3 agrees. If you don't, it's better to refer to some hight authority
2011-04-13T22:41:47  <Stocha> higher
2011-04-13T22:41:48  <j3camero> McLeopold: it sounds like things are moving along nicely on the technical front. I really appreciiate that you have stepped into a leadership role in this matter. Now what we need in order to progress with picking a launch date is to see a fully working contest instance. When we're able to submit bots and watch them play (non-public server of course, so the contest doesn't get off to a false start), then we can pick a launch date.
2011-04-13T22:41:53  <amstan> McLeopold: the date on it.. is impossible to remove, so ... yeah
2011-04-13T22:42:41  <McLeopold> so, who wants to do a nightly build server?
2011-04-13T22:42:45  <amstan> j3camero: we still need an ETA for that almost working state, otherwise we'll just take our time
2011-04-13T22:43:00  <amstan> McLeopold: i have a server.. i could play with something like that
2011-04-13T22:43:19  <Stocha> we realy  need an official tcp framework. if not a tcp server.
2011-04-13T22:43:33  <amstan> Stocha: idk if that's important at the moment
2011-04-13T22:43:35  <janzert> Stocha: not really, the community can provide it again
2011-04-13T22:43:36  <j3camero> amstan: ever set up buildbot before? I recomend it for nighly builds. Or even builds after every commit.
2011-04-13T22:43:37  <McLeopold> Stocha: I think that may be too much to do before launch
2011-04-13T22:43:38  <amstan> Stocha: let's get it launched first
2011-04-13T22:43:46  <amstan> j3camero: nope, never tried CI before
2011-04-13T22:43:48  <Stocha> janzert: so far it's failed to do so.
2011-04-13T22:44:02  <Stocha> if it does, that that will become the official thing
2011-04-13T22:44:02  <amstan> j3camero: buildbot seems cool though
2011-04-13T22:44:08  <janzert> so far it has for the last two contests, we never have had an official one
2011-04-13T22:44:11  <Stocha> but officiality will make it go faster.
2011-04-13T22:44:30  <Stocha> i have heard complaintes about starter bots
2011-04-13T22:44:39  <j3camero> A TCP server will fall out naturally after the launch. It's not launch critical.
2011-04-13T22:44:42  <Stocha> namely i recall c# and c++
2011-04-13T22:44:49  <amstan> Stocha: what about them?
2011-04-13T22:45:43  <Stocha> i'm only say things from memory. My memory is quite bad :p
2011-04-13T22:46:09  <j3camero> I guess that covers the launch date iitem on the agenda. We can pick a launch date when we have a fully working contest instance that we can actually submit bots to and watch them play.
2011-04-13T22:46:10  <Stocha> i think i heard a memory leak problem on c++ (might be a library that the guy used rather than starter bot in fact)
2011-04-13T22:46:29  <Stocha> and somone said c# was badly written :p
2011-04-13T22:46:48  <Stocha> i think antimatroid answered that people would rewrite the starter bots anyway.
2011-04-13T22:46:51  <amstan> Stocha: i don't see any c# starter pack: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots
2011-04-13T22:47:05  <Stocha> then i may be confused i suppose
2011-04-13T22:47:11  <amstan> Stocha: and i don't think c++ uses any libraries
2011-04-13T22:47:19  <j3camero> So we still have to talk about finding a sysadmin and finding money. I can briefly address the money point.
2011-04-13T22:47:47  <Stocha> might be the guy, he used a library. not the starter bot. well well, probably not big deal i suppose.
2011-04-13T22:48:29  <McLeopold> amstan: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/64
2011-04-13T22:48:30  <j3camero> When I get back from Florida (one week from now) I am going to incorporate a non-profit corporation asap. That will allow me to take donations from people without having to pay personal income tax on them. I will give our traditional sponsor, Google, right of first refusal. They are the sexiest sponsor!
2011-04-13T22:48:44  <Stocha> The "ant participating into a battle" things may need precision. if it's not been done yet :p
2011-04-13T22:49:28  <amstan> Stocha: what?
2011-04-13T22:49:32  <Stocha> If not for google as a sponsor, that might be a problem
2011-04-13T22:49:34  <j3camero> To incorporate a non-profit, I believe I need at least two directors besides myself. They may have to be Canadian. Not  sure. amstan, jbroman?
2011-04-13T22:49:36  <amstan> j3camero: sounds good
2011-04-13T22:49:40  <Stocha> The scoring scheme
2011-04-13T22:49:44  <amstan> j3camero: yep, i can do that
2011-04-13T22:49:51  <McLeopold> j3camero: someone from microsoft got in the top 5 last time.  Maybe you can contact high ranking bots of big corporations to see if we can get more sponsors?
2011-04-13T22:49:52  * amstan is a citizen
2011-04-13T22:49:56  <Stocha> it states that participating in killing an ant gives points.
2011-04-13T22:50:06  <Stocha> that needs clarification i think.
2011-04-13T22:50:22  <amstan> Stocha: this was undecided yet
2011-04-13T22:50:27  *** antiuni <antiuni!83d90606@gateway/web/freenode/ip.131.217.6.6> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-13T22:50:30  <Stocha> okay
2011-04-13T22:50:38  <antiuni> ... hi guys
2011-04-13T22:50:40  <antiuni> any news?
2011-04-13T22:50:47  <amstan> antiuni: we're in a meeting
2011-04-13T22:51:14  <Stocha> antiuni : the damage thing has been agreed on.
2011-04-13T22:51:19  <j3camero> McLeopold: good idea. I actually already have contacts at Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft ready to go. So I am optimistic. Google and Facebook are explicitly interested. Amazon and Msft I haven't probed too much.
2011-04-13T22:51:38  <McLeopold> wow, facebook?  what's their angle?
2011-04-13T22:51:48  <antiuni> Stocha: :D
2011-04-13T22:51:49  <amstan> McLeopold: they wanna cheat at farmville, lol
2011-04-13T22:51:53  <amstan> jk
2011-04-13T22:51:55  <McLeopold> haha
2011-04-13T22:52:23  <j3camero> Yeah I thought of that. If we ever do the Facebook AI Challenge, there can only be one game.
2011-04-13T22:52:37  <McLeopold> agricola?
2011-04-13T22:52:43  <amstan> to be fair, facebook has many other games
2011-04-13T22:52:48  <j3camero> Just kidding obvsiously. Farmville would be a terrible AI Challenge.
2011-04-13T22:53:17  * janzert wouldn't know, having avoided farmville at all costs ;)
2011-04-13T22:53:18  <Stocha> There should be some path that can be blocked in some maps though. Even if the algo ensure it always exists an alternative. Removing all blocking would be bad.
2011-04-13T22:53:32  <j3camero> Somebody will inevitably write a bot that figures out how to grow weed in Farmville and sell it at a profit in Gang Wars.
2011-04-13T22:54:01  <amstan> A new update on our development is the introduction of issues 2.0 on github, we can now assign issues to people: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/assigned/j3camero
2011-04-13T22:54:09  <McLeopold> Stocha: I think our solution was to ensure each starting position has a non-blockable path to all other starting positions
2011-04-13T22:54:21  <Stocha> i have to go i guess. see you. Thanks for the great job :p
2011-04-13T22:54:28  <McLeopold> cya
2011-04-13T22:54:37  *** Stocha <Stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-04-13T22:55:28  <McLeopold> so, if amstan gets a nightly build going, I'm good for now
2011-04-13T22:55:39  <amstan> j3camero: oh right.. do you have the db for RPS?
2011-04-13T22:55:48  <amstan> i was looking into archiving contests
2011-04-13T22:56:00  <antiuni> i had an idea for allowing old contests to run actually
2011-04-13T22:56:16  <j3camero> amstan: not sure. We can try to dig it up some other time. It's gotta be around somewhere. I think I ran RPS out of my personal CSC account.
2011-04-13T22:56:28  <antiuni> what if all old contests were just run on the "official tcp server", then we have some bots on the servers to play people on tcp if they need anyone
2011-04-13T22:56:33  <amstan> j3camero: the website used to work, but now it doesn't anymore...
2011-04-13T22:56:42  <amstan> j3camero: can you look around for the db, it might be gone..
2011-04-13T22:56:54  <McLeopold> antiuni: right now you can attempt to beat bocsimacko on tcp.zeroviz.us
2011-04-13T22:57:06  <antiuni> McLeopold: I want to play around with tron again :P
2011-04-13T22:57:28  <amstan> antiuni: people have open sourced their bots.. you can probably play against them locally
2011-04-13T22:57:45  <antiuni> amstan: it's a lot more fun playing people on a tcp
2011-04-13T22:57:58  <amstan> antiuni: but not a lot of people are on tcp
2011-04-13T22:58:01  <McLeopold> j3camero: if you non-profit allows US citizens, I'm willing to join.  Maybe it would help take in US donations?
2011-04-13T22:58:05  <antiuni> i'm referring to zeta with that idea, i stil think it's ideal to have old contest games runnable online
2011-04-13T22:58:35  <amstan> antiuni: that might be possible, we just need to think hardly about it
2011-04-13T22:58:38  <antiuni> but yeah, not important now, only mentioned it from another comment
2011-04-13T22:59:25  <amstan> McLeopold: do we have sandboxed compilation yet?
2011-04-13T22:59:28  <McLeopold> antiuni: ideally a new bot would only play enough games to give it an accurate rank, otherwise games wouldn't run continuously.
2011-04-13T22:59:42  <McLeopold> amstan: no...
2011-04-13T22:59:46  <amstan> janzert: are these fixed yet? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/13
2011-04-13T22:59:53  <amstan> McLeopold: hmm? are we planning to?
2011-04-13T23:00:33  <antiuni> McLeopold: if you had it running on tcp, you wouldn't need to run games unless people wanted, and it'd be reasonably cheap
2011-04-13T23:00:34  <j3camero> McLeopold: sounds good. It will become clear when I begin the incorporation. It's definitely possible that we can haave US directors. I know for-profits can have US directors.
2011-04-13T23:00:49  <McLeopold> amstan: yes, I don't think that would be to hard.  Just some changes to worker.py

2011-04-13T23:04:13  <j3camero> Okay so that's all wee can really say about money at this point.
2011-04-13T23:04:23  <janzert> amstan: not that I know of
2011-04-13T23:04:26  <j3camero> ny other comments/questions about money?
2011-04-13T23:06:01  <amstan> j3camero: will we have the money in time?
2011-04-13T23:06:15  <amstan> j3camero: we should get it soon if we plan to launch in like a month
2011-04-13T23:07:44  <McLeopold> janzert: can I assume website/api_server_setup.php is no longer needed?
2011-04-13T23:08:30  <janzert> something along those lines may will probably be needed but what is actually there certainly isn't correct anymore
2011-04-13T23:08:54  <McLeopold> did you create a worker setup script that calls it?
2011-04-13T23:09:51  <janzert> the ec2 instances basically run a very short (just a few lines) script on startup and the api_server_setup was the way it bootstrapped to the full setup script
2011-04-13T23:10:28  <janzert> that few line script has never been in the source repository since it hardcodes the api secret

2011-04-13T23:23:09  <amstan> j3camero: ok, what about ETA for launch, i understand we must have the alpha working on a server first, but when should we aim for that?
2011-04-13T23:24:23  <janzert> ASAP?
2011-04-13T23:24:33  <janzert> and not a moment before
2011-04-13T23:24:43  <amstan> janzert: that could mean 2 months
2011-04-13T23:24:49  <amstan> we could do better
2011-04-13T23:25:05  <janzert> by definition we can't ;)
2011-04-13T23:25:06  <amstan> McLeopold: what do you think? you seemed very shocked when you saw that fake eta
2011-04-13T23:25:22  <McLeopold> nah, we need something to shoot for
2011-04-13T23:25:24  <amstan> janzert: 2 months because of meh...iness
2011-04-13T23:25:50  <McLeopold> 16 days sounds fine
2011-04-13T23:26:06  <amstan> McLeopold: i really clicked blindingly on it
2011-04-13T23:27:10  <j3camero> I feel as though I lack the moral authority to impose a deadline, since I have done roughly zero percent of the actual work so far. If the hardest workers think that a goal date would help, then it must be self imposed.
2011-04-13T23:27:17  <antiuni> 2 months as in for starting the contest?
2011-04-13T23:27:19  <antiuni> that's ages away
2011-04-13T23:27:25  <antiuni> you will lose peoples interest by then
2011-04-13T23:27:25  <amstan> antiuni: yes, we don't want that
2011-04-13T23:27:47  <amstan> McLeopold: ok.. 16 days it is.. changing the title to Beta Launch?
2011-04-13T23:27:55  <McLeopold> yeah, beta
2011-04-13T23:29:27  <j3camero> Is 16 days for a working server feasible? Working as in, I can go to a URL, follow a tutorial, download  astarter package, submit it, see my ranking, watch replays, etc?
2011-04-13T23:29:50  <McLeopold> At least for a private beta, yes
2011-04-13T23:30:01  <McLeopold> there will be bugs
2011-04-13T23:32:14  <amstan> ok, i feel confident in this
2011-04-13T23:32:47  <McLeopold> amstan: when you get nightly builds going, we are going to need a way to check if our lastest checkin broke anything
2011-04-13T23:32:52  <j3camero> Sweet.
2011-04-13T23:32:59  <amstan> McLeopold: we need test scripts
2011-04-13T23:33:31  <j3camero> McLeopold: buildbot can do this. But it;s up to you to create the functional testing scripts that actually get run.
2011-04-13T23:33:49  <McLeopold> I was afraid of that.
2011-04-13T23:34:18  <amstan> McLeopold: we might be able to do this manually, the annoying work is actually getting it installed
2011-04-13T23:34:48  <McLeopold> I think having a least a server we can all hit and play with will be hugh
2011-04-13T23:35:03  <McLeopold> un, huge
2011-04-13T23:35:18  <McLeopold> dang, irc has made me a horrible typer
2011-04-13T23:38:24  <McLeopold> amstan: do you know where my exports are setup in ubuntu?
2011-04-13T23:38:27  <amstan> j3camero: cool thing: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1361
2011-04-13T23:38:33  <amstan> McLeopold: exports?
2011-04-13T23:39:04  <McLeopold> yea, I want to change my TERM export
2011-04-13T23:40:13  <amstan> McLeopold: i'm not that avid in bash, sorry
2011-04-13T23:40:20  <amstan> jbroman might know
2011-04-13T23:40:53  <amstan> j3camero: the creator has done a lot of work on it too, he seems excited, we could do it as our next contest
2011-04-13T23:41:18  <amstan> j3camero: though.. the contest with survival+communication+hd storage might also be cool.
2011-04-13T23:43:09  <j3camero> Oh my. amstan that looks cool.
2011-04-13T23:43:34  <amstan> j3camero: yeah, we'll just have to wait on that till next contest, this one should be fairly cool too
2011-04-13T23:43:51  <j3camero> I will fire him a quick email just to thank him for all that work.
2011-04-13T23:44:07  <amstan> j3camero: now.. back to ants.. are we decided on the battle option, and what about scoring?
2011-04-13T23:44:32  <j3camero> Can somebody do a forum announcement to update the people on where we are?
2011-04-13T23:44:43  <amstan> j3camero: yes, but where are we?
2011-04-13T23:44:51  <j3camero> Sounded to me like scoring was decided. Go with the food bonus idea.
2011-04-13T23:45:21  <janzert> scoring is at least ok until beta and we see how it works in practice
2011-04-13T23:45:45  <amstan> j3camero: as in the second last option here? http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1364 it has 0 votes...
2011-04-13T23:46:14  <janzert> that poll is very poorly worded
2011-04-13T23:46:23  <amstan> janzert: lol, ok
2011-04-13T23:46:48  <McLeopold> the food bonus is what janzert and I talked about to ensure the last bot standing has the best chance at getting the win
2011-04-13T23:47:09  <McLeopold> and to provide no incentive to "farming" or drawing out a game
2011-04-13T23:47:49  <amstan> McLeopold: it's whoever ate the most food, correct?
2011-04-13T23:47:56  <janzert> one thing I think got missed from the discussion to implementation is the bonus should also include your own living ants at the end as well
2011-04-13T23:48:01  <janzert> amstan: no
2011-04-13T23:48:03  <McLeopold> no, whoever killed the most ants
2011-04-13T23:48:57  <janzert> but the living ant part of it can be easily added if it becomes a problem
2011-04-13T23:49:34  <McLeopold> janzert: I think just living ants of crashed bots.  It is to simulate perfect play when there are no bots left assuming all current and future food gives you a point.
2011-04-13T23:50:06  <janzert> if you don't count the winners living ants then there is incentive to not spawn ants if you think you're going to win
2011-04-13T23:50:38  <janzert> thus potentially causing the game to go longer
2011-04-13T23:50:44  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-04-13T23:50:52  <j3camero> Okay, I gotta scram now. Big day tomorrow. I will try to get something out to the mailing list tomorrow that summarizes the main discussions had today.
2011-04-13T23:50:57  <janzert> but that may not become too big of a problem in practice
2011-04-13T23:51:08  <janzert> what mailing list? ;)
2011-04-13T23:51:19  <McLeopold> yeah, I'm not on a list :)
2011-04-13T23:51:19  <amstan> j3camero: i'm doing that on the forums now
2011-04-13T23:51:26  <janzert> see you later, j3camero
2011-04-13T23:51:34  <j3camero> As for the scoring system, amstan I encourage you to make use of the new triumvirate system. I am probably going to be seriously awol over the next week due to vacation.
2011-04-13T23:51:49  <amstan> j3camero: ok, cool
2011-04-13T23:51:54  <amstan> j3camero: enjoy
2011-04-13T23:52:02  <j3camero> amstan: thanks dude.
2011-04-13T23:52:05  <McLeopold> j3camero: could you make a committment to check in at known times once a week?
2011-04-13T23:52:16  <amstan> that would be nice, yes
2011-04-13T23:52:27  <amstan> we get so much done with this guidance
2011-04-13T23:53:10  <janzert> doesn't even have to be specific time, just let amstan know at least 18 hours before hand ;)
2011-04-13T23:53:25  <j3camero> McLeopold: that is a good idea. I really owe you at least that, if not more. Why don't I say Monday evenings EST, barring unusualy circumstances?
2011-04-13T23:53:30  <McLeopold> janzert: let's include living ants in the food bonus for now.  It will only make a difference if the turns remaining is very small, we can check the logic after beta
2011-04-13T23:54:01  <McLeopold> j3camero: sounds good, 7:00pm PST is best for me
2011-04-13T23:54:10  <McLeopold> 10:00PM for you?
2011-04-13T23:54:29  <McLeopold> my monday night routine is very stable
2011-04-13T23:54:40  <j3camero> McLeopold: yep 10 PM. That works well, since that's when I'm usually winding down to go to sleep.
2011-04-13T23:56:08  <janzert> McLeopold: including the ants in bonus sounds good to me, since I think it's strictly better
2011-04-13T23:56:34  <McLeopold> I'm writing the issue right now...
