2011-12-12T00:04:03  <BenJackson> huh, drand48 is pretty damn expensive
2011-12-12T00:10:57  <thestinger> BenJackson: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random not sure if gcc/libstdc++ have this stuff yet
2011-12-12T00:11:36  <BenJackson> I'm just using drand48() as parto f my simulated annealing
2011-12-12T00:11:48  <BenJackson> it's surprisingly slow
2011-12-12T00:12:07  <thestinger> I think the C++11 rand stuff lets you pick a generator
2011-12-12T00:12:32  <BenJackson> I'm just going to switch from exp() < drand48() to exp()*RAND_MAX < random()
2011-12-12T00:14:58  <BenJackson> random() is about 10x faster than drand48()

2011-12-12T00:20:16  <dragonfyre13> ok, been at this since friday, time to watch a tv show and go to bed. Tired....
2011-12-12T00:20:19  <dragonfyre13> night all
2011-12-12T00:20:38  <thestinger> BenJackson: the linux rand() is the same generator as random() according to the man page
2011-12-12T00:21:02  <thestinger> but it says not to use it if you want it to be portable, cause the old rand() is crap
2011-12-12T00:21:13  <thestinger> anyway doesn't matter since the contest server is modern linux
2011-12-12T00:21:35  <BenJackson> oh I know way too much about random
2011-12-12T00:21:45  <BenJackson> I even filed an obscure bug against the glibc one
2011-12-12T00:21:59  <BenJackson> a friend of mine got interested in attacks on random() on the nethack server
2011-12-12T00:22:14  <BenJackson> someone noticed they were using srandom(time())
2011-12-12T00:22:27  <BenJackson> so to make a point he started a game at just the right second of the day so there would be a wand of wishing on the first level
2011-12-12T00:22:30  <BenJackson> and then kicked it
2011-12-12T00:22:32  <BenJackson> (that kills you)
2011-12-12T00:22:42  <BenJackson> so it would show he died from kicking a wand of wishing on lvl 1
2011-12-12T00:23:05  <BenJackson> the server operators changed it to use srandom( 4 bytes from /dev/urandom, which is truly random in some sense)
2011-12-12T00:23:14  <BenJackson> so still pseudorandom, but you can't game the seed
2011-12-12T00:23:25  <BenJackson> my friend had worked out ways in which the game leaked out bits of random
2011-12-12T00:23:39  <thestinger> oh, so he figured out the state?
2011-12-12T00:23:41  <BenJackson> and had written some code to search every seed (2^32) to figure out which one he was in
2011-12-12T00:24:00  <BenJackson> he came to me when he thought he wanted to put it in an FPGA
2011-12-12T00:24:19  <BenJackson> ultimately I wrote a version that searched the seed space 50x faster
2011-12-12T00:24:23  <BenJackson> something like 25M seeds/sec
2011-12-12T00:24:37  <BenJackson> basically in a prototype of how I'd do it in an FPGA, but in C

2011-12-12T00:24:52  <BenJackson> and after that I computed a sort of rainbow table
2011-12-12T00:24:55  <BenJackson> it made a 16G file
2011-12-12T00:25:01  <BenJackson> and could tell you the seed in a fraction of a second
2011-12-12T00:25:10  <BenJackson> ANYWAY
2011-12-12T00:25:21  <BenJackson> glibc interpreted negative seeds wrong
2011-12-12T00:25:37  <BenJackson> which I discovered because I reimplemented random/srandom in a much faster way for that project
2011-12-12T00:25:43  <thestinger> glibc is crap though
2011-12-12T00:26:07  <BenJackson> btw that is the only project where I've ever seen a HUGE difference between 32 and 64-bit performance
2011-12-12T00:26:21  <BenJackson> that 25M seed/sec program built for 32 bit on the same CPU is only about 50-60% as fast
2011-12-12T00:27:03  <thestinger> with -march=native?

2011-12-12T00:27:29  <BenJackson> there's my obscure bug
2011-12-12T00:27:46  <BenJackson> just -m32
2011-12-12T00:28:46  <BenJackson> that program also had very careful balancing of "likely" and "unlikely"
2011-12-12T00:28:52  <BenJackson> some (true) likelys actually slowed it down

2011-12-12T00:30:14  <thestinger> clang can almost compile my bot
2011-12-12T00:30:23  <thestinger> it just doesn't support C++11 lambdas
2011-12-12T00:30:30  <thestinger> but apparently it _does_ support lambdas
2011-12-12T00:31:02  <thestinger> well, it has objective-C blocks as a C language extension or something like that
2011-12-12T00:31:48  <thestinger> not sure how to build it with support for them though, the Arch package for clang is already barely hacked together
2011-12-12T00:32:31  <bqf> BenJackson: "(...) how I'd do it in an FPGA, but in C" <--- with the limited amount of FPGA programming i have done, the first thing that would come to mind would be parallelizing it. since i can't imagine that that approach would be 50x faster in C (unless you have 50 cores), what was your idea?
2011-12-12T00:32:35  <thestinger> I tried some bits of my code in clang though, and the performance differences are very neat
2011-12-12T00:33:39  <BenJackson> bqf: if you look at how random() is implemented and convolve it to avoid repeated operations you can go much much faster
2011-12-12T00:34:23  <BenJackson> actually I don't think an FPGA implementation would be better
2011-12-12T00:34:45  <bqf> BenJackson: oh, of course... if you're trying to search the whole space there's no need to start from scratch every time.
2011-12-12T00:35:24  <BenJackson> in particular if you are willing to search the seeds in the order of srandom()'s own internal LFSR you can eliminate a ton of math
2011-12-12T00:35:55  <BenJackson> the next step of srandom is actually invoking random() 300ish times to stir the pot of its internal state
2011-12-12T00:36:05  <BenJackson> to avoid some initial degeneracy I think
2011-12-12T00:36:19  <BenJackson> so it stirs up its 31 (I think it is) terms of random state
2011-12-12T00:36:36  <BenJackson> whereas I precomputed the coefficients of the resulting 31 terms that apply to the initial seed
2011-12-12T00:37:40  <BenJackson> and finally since you are testing several sequential outputs of random when searching the seeds it is able to pipeline those
2011-12-12T00:38:16  <BenJackson> since a huge amount is shared between the first output of a given seed and the second output of the *previous* seed (given you're searching them in the order I described)
2011-12-12T00:40:07  <bqf> i really shouldn't be talking to you. every time i do (or listen in on conversations you're having here), you make me want to research some obscure, but incredibly interesting topic.
2011-12-12T00:40:29  <BenJackson> that was a really interesting project
2011-12-12T00:40:41  <BenJackson> the adjunct project (figure out how to exploit the known seed) never got done, though :)
2011-12-12T00:40:51  <bmh> BenJackson: I tend to hate everyone's RNG.
2011-12-12T00:41:20  <BenJackson> a friend of mine was trying to work out (given the seed) how many times to do some action that burned 1 random() before you did something like make a wish or pray
2011-12-12T00:41:21  <bmh> In particular, I have it in for Mersenne's Twister
2011-12-12T00:44:28  <bqf> BenJackson: if the adjunct project caused you to dig that deep into a topic and stay interested, then it has served its purpose. i guess i need new friends, when mine come to me with a technology related problem, it is mostly "how do i cheat in game X?" or "can you get me this movie?" (no, i can't. go pay for it.)
2011-12-12T00:45:39  <BenJackson> technically this WAS "how to cheat at nethack"
2011-12-12T00:46:44  <bmh> BenJackson: I do a tiny bit of development on the game Dungeon Crawl (along with Zannick) -- I ended up rewriting the RNG to prevent exactly that sort of attack
2011-12-12T00:47:26  <BenJackson> btw if you like nethack you should look at the nethack AIs that are out there
2011-12-12T00:47:42  <BenJackson> saiph in particular
2011-12-12T00:47:52  <BenJackson> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDAmUNofE00
2011-12-12T00:47:55  <BenJackson> as an example
2011-12-12T00:48:20  <BenJackson> the neat thing about it is that it's very modular, so if you solve some part of nethack (eg sokoban or the castle or whatever) you canplug it in
2011-12-12T00:48:47  <BenJackson> plus it can use those strategies you're too lazy to use, like engraving Elbereth all the damn time
2011-12-12T00:49:10  <bmh> That's cute. The problem is that nethack is tedious and there's an 'optimal' strategy
2011-12-12T00:52:08  <bqf> i never really got into nethack - mainly because i could instantly recognize its potential to kill weeks of my time. botting it does sound interesting though, so once again, i _really_ shouldn't be talking to you ;)
2011-12-12T00:52:32  <bmh> I quit crawl when I was 18 and thankfully didn't discover crawl until 5 years later.
2011-12-12T00:52:34  <BenJackson> nethack is amazing for the way everything works together

2011-12-12T00:53:09  <BenJackson> bmh: I'm playing Skyrim :)
2011-12-12T00:53:49  <bmh> mid-game I'm finding that my goals become instable and ants near the hill never really run away from the hill. Suggestions?
2011-12-12T00:54:14  <BenJackson> same thing happened to me
2011-12-12T00:54:38  <BenJackson> couple ideas:  change your idea of explored ever to explored "recently"
2011-12-12T00:54:45  <BenJackson> so it keeps refreshing
2011-12-12T00:54:55  <BenJackson> or add the refreshing one as a secondary goal
2011-12-12T00:55:03  <BenJackson> V7 did something like that, I think
2011-12-12T00:56:07  <bmh> v2 beats v3. I think I might have made a mistake
2011-12-12T00:56:23  <BenJackson> that's why I keep all the old ones around
2011-12-12T00:56:33  <bmh> That's why I use git and tags
2011-12-12T00:56:41  <BenJackson> yep
2011-12-12T00:58:08  <bmh> v2 uses integer values for goals and each ant moves toward its nearest goal. v3 transforms those scores 1/sqrt(n) and then sums over the directions

2011-12-12T00:59:16  <BenJackson> I used integer values for goals
2011-12-12T00:59:24  <BenJackson> but then I scaled them
2011-12-12T00:59:34  <BenJackson> something like if > threshold use *mul/div
2011-12-12T00:59:49  <BenJackson> so local goals would use 1/n to make it uninteresting far away
2011-12-12T01:00:01  <BenJackson> errr n/1
2011-12-12T01:00:10  <BenJackson> and goals like hills would use 1/n so it seemed "closer"
2011-12-12T01:00:50  <bmh> oh, I see the problem. Some of my BFSs are blocked by ants. Ants go through choke points near the hill, which causes other ants to reverse course
2011-12-12T01:00:55  <BenJackson> I'm pretty much convinced now that despite my attempts to avoid it the only way to win is going to be to assign to each individual bot
2011-12-12T01:01:38  <BenJackson> yeah I wrote path costing but I've yet to use it
2011-12-12T01:01:47  <BenJackson> I'm afraid of how... emergent... its behavior coudl be
2011-12-12T01:02:42  <bmh> my costing is implicit. The BFS gets staunched at an ant, so the scores traveling through an ant are something like: n, n+1, n+3

2011-12-12T01:05:24  <BenJackson> I stopped V7 when someone mentioned it was beating them a lot
2011-12-12T01:06:11  <AntDroid_> do you guys use an ant to block BFS? i currently don't, makes my exploration weaker
2011-12-12T01:06:30  <BenJackson> not sure it does, really
2011-12-12T01:06:33  <BenJackson> one ant doesn't block much
2011-12-12T01:06:51  <BenJackson> even if the cost of the ant is 1000 the cost of walking around the ant is only like 5
2011-12-12T01:07:31  <BenJackson> plus let's say it DOES work (there's a chokepoint).  do you really mean that THAT ant is responsible for everything on the other side?
2011-12-12T01:07:38  <BenJackson> since it is "on the way" over there
2011-12-12T01:08:26  <AntDroid_> yes. my problem is that at chokepoints my ants just pile up there
2011-12-12T01:08:42  <bmh> AntDroid_: I block BFS depending on the goal type -- 'enemy ant,' yes, to get my ants to flow around and try to envelop the target
2011-12-12T01:08:53  <AntDroid_> so i wanted to limit the number of ants there at 1 layer
2011-12-12T01:09:23  <AntDroid_> the problem is that at mazes my exploration doesn't work well

2011-12-12T02:15:04  <McLeopold> arg, my battle simulator assumes ants can't move on to each other :(
2011-12-12T02:15:18  <McLeopold> considering I wrote the dang engine, that is pretty stupid :(
2011-12-12T02:15:51  *** TheLinker <TheLinker!~TheLinker@200.117.99.103> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye)
2011-12-12T02:16:02  <bmh> McLeopold: why do we pick up food by walking next to it?
2011-12-12T02:16:20  <McLeopold> instead of on it?
2011-12-12T02:16:24  <bmh> yes
2011-12-12T02:16:45  <McLeopold> we originally had a radius, so you only had to be within 3 squares
2011-12-12T02:16:54  <McLeopold> then we started playing with the numbers
2011-12-12T02:17:21  <McLeopold> at one point it was highly likely that 2 ants could both be within range, it which case the food would vanish
2011-12-12T02:18:08  <McLeopold> we lowered it to 1, which at the time was the closest you could get, because we wanted the map in a matrix and you couldn't have 2 things at the same spot
2011-12-12T02:18:24  <AntDroid_> what would happen if             a*b ?
2011-12-12T02:18:29  *** roflmao <roflmao!~jstrong@189.229.217.18> has left #aichallenge
2011-12-12T02:18:50  <McLeopold> AntDroid_: food goes away, no one gets it
2011-12-12T02:18:57  <McLeopold> but it can't happen
2011-12-12T02:18:58  <AntDroid_> who gets the food? is it vanished or both ants will kill each other?
2011-12-12T02:19:10  <McLeopold> the attack will happen first, and the ants will die
2011-12-12T02:19:30  <janzert> McLeopold: can still happen only if the food spawns next to a hill at the same time an ant spawns on the hill
2011-12-12T02:19:38  <McLeopold> also, we had battle types that allowed ants to live if they were near each other, so we needed the rule for that as well
2011-12-12T02:19:46  <janzert> ahh, right
2011-12-12T02:19:50  <McLeopold> janzert: nope
2011-12-12T02:20:07  <McLeopold> well, yes, you can see it, but the gather happens after the deaths
2011-12-12T02:20:14  <McLeopold> so the next turn will be _*_
2011-12-12T02:20:52  <AntDroid_> ah. okay.

2011-12-12T02:34:47  <antimatroid1> bmh: ants also used to spawn at food before ant hills, so it wouldn't have worked very well to spawn ants tehre

2011-12-12T03:48:15  <Garf> my bot dropped like 50 places this weekend
2011-12-12T03:48:22  <Garf> people must be submitting new ones like crazy
2011-12-12T03:48:38  <BenJackson> I'm trying to figure out if I moved back up or if some people resub'd
2011-12-12T03:48:40  <Wraithan> They want to get testing in before the final
2011-12-12T03:48:45  <bhasker> my bot is slowly climbing the ranks
2011-12-12T03:48:47  <bhasker> at 807 now!
2011-12-12T03:48:58  <bhasker> if only i could make my battle code faster
2011-12-12T03:49:02  <bhasker> stupid thing timesout all the time
2011-12-12T03:49:08  <bhasker> my move generator for minmax sucks
2011-12-12T03:49:16  <bhasker> maybe i should just switch to the battle described in the forums
2011-12-12T03:49:32  <BenJackson> it's obviously "enough"
2011-12-12T03:49:42  <BenJackson> since that guy is Memetix
2011-12-12T03:49:43  <bhasker> did it work for you ben?
2011-12-12T03:49:55  <Wraithan> My bot blows and I am at 1400s
2011-12-12T03:49:56  <BenJackson> no, I wrote mine before that and it's much different
2011-12-12T03:50:03  <bhasker> ah k
2011-12-12T03:50:08  <Wraithan> Hope to have a new bot ready tonight to resub and see where it can go
2011-12-12T03:50:12  <BenJackson> I don't think combat is differentiating that much in the top 10
2011-12-12T03:50:13  <bhasker> a1k0n is also doing quite well
2011-12-12T03:50:19  <BenJackson> I think in the top 10 it's back to strategy
2011-12-12T03:50:20  <bhasker> so mostly exploration?
2011-12-12T03:50:24  <bhasker> and when to fight
2011-12-12T03:50:33  <BenJackson> look at xathis on fluxid
2011-12-12T03:50:41  <BenJackson> his positioning of ants is crazy good
2011-12-12T03:50:48  * Wraithan started late so his goal is to break into the top 500
2011-12-12T03:50:58  <BenJackson> wraithan: beware creeping goals
2011-12-12T03:51:06  <BenJackson> I was happy with top 25 or so until I broke into the top 10 :)
2011-12-12T03:51:19  <Wraithan> BenJackson: heh
2011-12-12T03:51:26  <Wraithan> I'm already spending all my spare time on my bot
2011-12-12T03:51:33  <Wraithan> but I just got started last weekend
2011-12-12T03:51:54  <BenJackson> so at this instant I'm #10.  my vague goal would be to be solidly in the top 10 so as to be sure to stay there in the finals
2011-12-12T03:52:00  <bhasker> nice ben

2011-12-12T03:53:42  <BenJackson> that's why being #10 (or say #13 like I was earlier this afternoon) is no good!
2011-12-12T03:54:04  <Wraithan> If you don't have a top ranking bot is it worth playing on fluxid?
2011-12-12T03:54:21  <BenJackson> sure, there's a mix of bots
2011-12-12T03:54:30  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/QUxumwqt current top 20 mu
2011-12-12T03:54:33  <BenJackson> if you're at 1500 you might try bhasker.net instead
2011-12-12T03:54:39  <Garf> fluxid has insaly good bots
2011-12-12T03:54:44  <Wraithan> BenJackson: thanks

2011-12-12T03:56:13  <BenJackson> janzerT: you should make that a page
2011-12-12T03:56:33  <BenJackson> anyway that list by mu is pretty close to what's in my mind
2011-12-12T03:56:46  <BenJackson> I don't expect to be xathis, pguillory or ChrisH
2011-12-12T03:56:50  <janzert> people would pretty certainly generally take the wrong idea from such a page
2011-12-12T03:56:54  <BenJackson> haven't been watching GreenTea or Flag lately

2011-12-12T03:57:26  <Garf> isn't that expected?
2011-12-12T03:57:35  <Garf> it's harder for xanthis to find close opponents

2011-12-12T10:08:55  <Fluxid> i have no idea if and how he intentionaly isolates enemy
2011-12-12T10:09:13  <Fluxid> it looks like he actually work on isolating anemy and killing one by one
2011-12-12T10:13:14  <Anilm3> Certainly looks that way
2011-12-12T10:13:48  <Anilm3> another thing I noticed
2011-12-12T10:14:06  <Anilm3> is that he takes into account enemy ants when attacking to a third enemy
2011-12-12T10:14:37  <Anilm3> I don't know if it's intentional or just something emergent
2011-12-12T10:15:24  <avdg> maybe its trying to make hidden formations

2011-12-12T12:34:30  <a1k0n> so i guess it is indeed fair to say our approaches are broadly comparable
2011-12-12T12:34:45  <a1k0n> except his takes 1/1000th the CPU power
2011-12-12T12:34:49  <rwest> haha
2011-12-12T12:35:05  <McLeopold> a1k0n: I think he also has a lot of logic he didn't describe
2011-12-12T12:35:16  <a1k0n> perhaps.  i guess i do too
2011-12-12T12:35:55  <McLeopold> a1k0n: I implemented formations and shoehorned it into your method
2011-12-12T12:36:01  <McLeopold> it's helped out alot
2011-12-12T12:36:07  <a1k0n> formations eh
2011-12-12T12:36:10  <McLeopold> I don't have to do the dependant ant thing
2011-12-12T12:36:23  <a1k0n> meaning you consider moves of ants in formation together?
2011-12-12T12:36:32  <McLeopold> kind of
2011-12-12T12:36:43  <a1k0n> you're not going to submit your bot?
2011-12-12T12:36:50  <McLeopold> after moving 1 ant, I get a hash of only my ants and their formation
2011-12-12T12:36:54  <McLeopold> a1k0n: no
2011-12-12T12:36:56  <avdg> I wish I could do big array operations (preferably with a simple syntax)
2011-12-12T12:37:40  <McLeopold> for each formation formed by a single ant's best move, inc the counter by one

2011-12-12T12:38:06  <McLeopold> then instead of returning individual moves, I return formations, with the instructions to reach them

2011-12-12T12:38:31  <McLeopold> this also help avoid ant swaping
2011-12-12T12:38:44  <McLeopold> it's all in python and very slow
2011-12-12T12:38:51  <McLeopold> a fomation is a tuple of tuples :)
2011-12-12T12:38:55  <BenJackson> I just accepted ant swapping
2011-12-12T12:38:58  <avdg> my implementation doesn't allow swapping
2011-12-12T12:39:06  <BenJackson> because it was going to be more expensive to eliminate it
2011-12-12T12:39:09  <a1k0n> could add a peephole optimizer to un-swap them :)
2011-12-12T12:39:17  <BenJackson> and sometimes a whole bunch of meaningless moves actually do something
2011-12-12T12:39:22  <avdg> except if I have a version to move 2 ants at the same time (which requires me to write an other function)
2011-12-12T12:39:44  <McLeopold> I do allow swaping, I just don't consider different ways to rotate into the same position as different
2011-12-12T12:40:07  <besh> My bot had more than 600 ants but fortunately it didn't time out. But all of its ants were piled up at choke points.
2011-12-12T12:40:12  <McLeopold> so, whichever random set of moves made the formation the first time, that is all I store
2011-12-12T12:40:14  <a1k0n> so i don't get it.  how do you decide which ants are part of which formation?
2011-12-12T12:40:19  <besh> How do you avoid that ?
2011-12-12T12:40:38  <McLeopold> a formation is a list of final destinations for my ants only

2011-12-12T12:41:26  <McLeopold> a1k0n: it helped me solve this a a _ _ b
2011-12-12T12:42:02  <McLeopold> the left ant moving east is good most of the time, the right ant moving up or down to line up with it is good half the time
2011-12-12T12:42:19  <rwest> wow, I almost won a game with no food collecting code working
2011-12-12T12:42:20  <McLeopold> the same is with moving backwards, right goes west, left goes up or down
2011-12-12T12:42:22  <rwest> kinda funny
2011-12-12T12:42:45  <McLeopold> so for each individual ant, moving e or w was the best move, so they just swapped places
2011-12-12T12:42:55  <avdg> funny, my only cares about collecting food
2011-12-12T12:43:18  <rwest> avdg: I broke the base code that processed food tiles hah
2011-12-12T12:43:31  <pairofdice> I think it was spectral clustering....
2011-12-12T12:45:04  <a1k0n> McLeopold: ah yes, heh
2011-12-12T12:45:07  <BenJackson> is anyone using any more sophisticated distance heuristics than manhattan?
2011-12-12T12:45:14  <BenJackson> like waypoints or whatnot?
2011-12-12T12:46:01  <McLeopold> a1k0n: so, if a combat set is large enough, there is no way I can hit all the formations, and I might not hit a formation more than a couple of times
2011-12-12T12:46:11  <McLeopold> a1k0n: that's where your sampling method comes in

2011-12-12T12:46:40  <BenJackson> the pousse program I lost to was clever about searching the move tree
2011-12-12T12:46:53  <BenJackson> they hashed the whole board and if any tree hit that board again they knew the result already

2011-12-12T12:49:06  <jstrong> bug DOWN
2011-12-12T12:50:03  <jstrong> two big bugs down
2011-12-12T12:50:26  <Anilm3> xathis:  is taking a long time for his next game...
2011-12-12T12:50:31  <Anilm3> -:
2011-12-12T12:50:51  <BenJackson> jstrong: yesterday I found my entire exploration frontier was one square to the east of where it should have been
2011-12-12T12:50:54  <BenJackson> sadly not a game changer :)
2011-12-12T12:51:44  <avdg> I expect that xathis will play in around 20 min
2011-12-12T12:51:56  <jstrong> bj: hah nice
2011-12-12T12:52:08  <jstrong> bj: today I discovered that 1. i was double counting enemies for my new island system
2011-12-12T12:52:17  <jstrong> which is why the whole prediction went to the toilet and my bot skill went to the toilet as well
2011-12-12T12:52:17  <rwest> wow, I just sat here for 5 minutes debugging my combat
2011-12-12T12:52:27  <rwest> to realize I commented out the call to run it
2011-12-12T12:52:33  <jstrong> and 2. I was using information about ENEMY ANTS for combat prediction moves
2011-12-12T12:52:39  <jstrong> when i should have been suing the maps for MY ants
2011-12-12T12:52:53  <jstrong> creating stupid prediction moves for my enemies also screwing around with the payoff matrix
2011-12-12T12:53:09  <McLeopold> http://paste.aichallenge.org/Ek04K/
2011-12-12T12:53:44  <jstrong> which explains why i would get into so many 1v1s
2011-12-12T12:53:54  <jstrong> because the "offensive" move I'd predict for my enemy didn't actually pit him against me
2011-12-12T12:54:06  <jstrong> making the me defense he offense score be a nice 0
2011-12-12T12:54:09  <jstrong> meaning a neutral move
2011-12-12T12:54:16  <jstrong> meaning my bot would suicide into enemy ants sometimes
2011-12-12T12:56:40  <jstrong> now maybe this will make my bot worse
2011-12-12T12:56:44  <jstrong> since it will make it more cautious
2011-12-12T12:56:55  <jstrong> meaning i gotta tweak some of the other stuff to implement intentional aggressivity xD

2011-12-12T13:18:31  <Anilm3> xathis: tell us your new secrets
2011-12-12T13:19:03  <rwest> Hey anybody tried seeing what happens when 3 ants move on the same tile?
2011-12-12T13:19:18  <pairofdice> nuclear fusion
2011-12-12T13:19:29  <avdg> whats next, four ants?
2011-12-12T13:19:30  <Fluxid> i'm pretty sure he did, his ants rush in group to hill that wasn't seen
2011-12-12T13:19:30  <avdg> :p
2011-12-12T13:19:52  <Fluxid> rwest: WHAT ABOUT SIX?
2011-12-12T13:20:45  <pairofdice> Will it blend?!
2011-12-12T13:20:54  <Fluxid> move six ants to the same tile and every enemy dies and you get +100 bonus points

2011-12-12T13:21:28  <rwest> Fluxid: I was thinking like what Darhuuk  said on forums, maybe you can take enemy hills like that if 1 ant is left
2011-12-12T13:21:55  <Fluxid> rwest: what do you mean?
2011-12-12T13:22:17  <Fluxid> you can raze hill even with ant on top of it
2011-12-12T13:22:18  <rwest> say the enemy hill has ants in it
2011-12-12T13:22:27  <rwest> maybe moving 2 ants onto it
2011-12-12T13:22:35  <rwest> will cause 2 to die from collision and leave you 1
2011-12-12T13:22:42  <rwest> to take it
2011-12-12T13:22:43  <Fluxid> you don't need to spawnkill all the ants in hill
2011-12-12T13:23:10  <rwest> I dunno if it works, that's why I asked if anybody has seen what happens when 3 ants stack
2011-12-12T13:23:51  <pairofdice> You do, unless the ant moves
2011-12-12T13:23:55  <pairofdice> Is how I understood it

2011-12-12T13:41:19  <roflmao> i compile a map of ints
2011-12-12T13:41:29  <roflmao> with all the tiles that are in the combat radius of any ant on the map
2011-12-12T13:41:30  <UncleVasya> btw, after last contest bots of different ranks were published. While being #310 I have found something interesting even in some bot with rank over 600.
2011-12-12T13:41:39  <roflmao> then I start a BFS from enemy tiles
2011-12-12T13:41:52  <roflmao> make sure they haven't been used for an already existing island
2011-12-12T13:42:06  <roflmao> and then ignore tiles that have a value of 0 on the map of ints
2011-12-12T13:42:11  <roflmao> (ergo they aren't part of a combat radius)
2011-12-12T13:42:17  <roflmao> so it grabs all clusters of combat radius
2011-12-12T13:42:23  <roflmao> .. but

2011-12-12T13:42:41  <roflmao> the pistachio ant way over on the left
2011-12-12T13:42:42  <avdg> UncleVasya: its also a different ranking system if I'm right, but still an interesting fact
2011-12-12T13:42:44  <roflmao> is part of that one huge combat
2011-12-12T13:42:54  <roflmao> since there is an actual link between all the radiuses of that entire area
2011-12-12T13:43:03  <roflmao> when in reality they are two completely different combat zones
2011-12-12T13:43:15  <roflmao> so my ants on the bottom wont attack because the ant dying on top is reducing the score of an offensive move
2011-12-12T13:43:27  <roflmao> (on the left better said)
2011-12-12T13:44:31  <roflmao> maybe I should use attackradius MINUS 1?
2011-12-12T13:44:34  <BenJackson> my method:
2011-12-12T13:44:36  <roflmao> for the int compilation
2011-12-12T13:44:40  <BenJackson> 1) find all enemy ants threatened by me
2011-12-12T13:44:48  <BenJackson> 2) find all my ants threatened by enemy
2011-12-12T13:45:13  <BenJackson> into a common map label each combat radius of both sets using union-find to merge overlaps
2011-12-12T13:45:56  <BenJackson> then for each label that was created, if it is the root of a union-find tree, pick all ants and enemies that are in that "island"
2011-12-12T13:46:37  <BenJackson> then for each label if there were any ants in it (some will not have ants because they're not the root of a tree) run combat just like I did before
2011-12-12T13:46:40  <BenJackson> but only considering those ants
2011-12-12T13:46:52  <roflmao> not sure what you mean by "label"

2011-12-12T13:47:45  <roflmao> ah i see
2011-12-12T13:47:49  <BenJackson> for every ant in combat (both sides): in a grid of ints assign 'n' to every square in its combat radius
2011-12-12T13:47:56  <BenJackson> if you find a pre-existing n, use union-find to merge it
2011-12-12T13:48:26  <BenJackson> you could do it other ways, union-find is just the "best" way
2011-12-12T13:48:39  <UncleVasya> roflmao: I thought about dividing big combats into subcombats.
2011-12-12T13:48:52  <BenJackson> but you could use maps or anything to say equiv[n] = some other n you found overlapping

2011-12-12T13:49:04  <BenJackson> so long as you have a way to find some COMMON n for ALL n that got unioned
2011-12-12T13:49:04  <avdg> I wonder if it wouldn't be interested to just create arrays of it with a number how high the threat would be
2011-12-12T13:49:26  <UncleVasya> It can increase your speed (at the cost of little decreasing of accuracy)/
2011-12-12T13:49:48  <avdg> it can be used for many things for simply 1 map
2011-12-12T13:49:54  <roflmao> right
2011-12-12T13:49:57  <roflmao> so the overlap of the combat zones
2011-12-12T13:50:04  <UncleVasya> But I found that optimizing move generator is much easier.
2011-12-12T13:50:25  <roflmao> using simple +1 on the int map this would mean a row/col value greater than 1
2011-12-12T13:50:35  <roflmao> (if you do it properly

2011-12-12T14:10:33  <roflmao> bj one last question
2011-12-12T14:10:37  <roflmao> do assign a unique label to every ant?
2011-12-12T14:10:48  <roflmao> ergo three ants are threatened in the same battle
2011-12-12T14:10:58  <roflmao> so you assign labels '1' '2' and '3'
2011-12-12T14:11:04  <roflmao> then have 3 union finds that you go through
2011-12-12T14:11:18  <roflmao> since by definition for them to be in the same battle there is overlap between their combat zones
2011-12-12T14:11:27  <BenJackson> yes
2011-12-12T14:11:36  <BenJackson> during the labelling every ant is assigned a new id
2011-12-12T14:11:50  <BenJackson> as you iterate over its combat area you may find other ids
2011-12-12T14:11:53  <BenJackson> you union with those
2011-12-12T14:12:05  <roflmao> hm
2011-12-12T14:12:08  <BenJackson> union find has two operations, union and find (!)
2011-12-12T14:12:22  <roflmao> because i think it will still cause a union that I don't want
2011-12-12T14:12:25  <iglo> have they changed the timeout deadline?
2011-12-12T14:12:30  <BenJackson> so while labelling if grid(loc) is already labelled, union(my new label, grid(loc))
2011-12-12T14:12:46  <BenJackson> later for all ants, the group it's in is find(grid(loc))
2011-12-12T14:13:02  <BenJackson> iglo: no, but there are new timeout issues

2011-12-12T14:22:49  <UncleVasya> In his next version he will teach his ants to spawn directly on the enemy hill.
2011-12-12T14:22:50  <g0llum> no, i mean, where does it get the data from ?
2011-12-12T14:23:04  <avdg> I think game position
2011-12-12T14:23:17  <BenJackson> UncleVasya: at one point I wondered what the game would be like with "powerups"
2011-12-12T14:24:49  * avdg guesses many people should look at xathis stats in 10 min
2011-12-12T14:25:29  <xathis> my profile page says 5 mins remaining
2011-12-12T14:25:30  <BenJackson> he'll win at least 4 in a row
2011-12-12T14:25:30  <g0llum> next contest should come with some rest-api for bots, twitter feeds, etc
2011-12-12T14:25:37  <BenJackson> I think all of my bots have won at least 4 or 5 in a row
2011-12-12T14:25:52  <BenJackson> xathis can probably win 6 and get in the top 100 that way
2011-12-12T14:25:57  <BenJackson> he'll be in the top 100 by 7 games for sure
2011-12-12T14:26:02  <BenJackson> not going to be too interesting until then

2011-12-12T15:41:36  <BenJackson> to avoid someone trying to game it

2011-12-12T15:45:04  <xathis> UncleVasya: 7 classes, 100kb total
2011-12-12T15:45:29  <Garf> thats not much (certainy given that it must be java)
2011-12-12T15:46:05  <Fluxid> I'm sad, my new "combat" works rather poorly, and i don't know it needs tweaking or scrap whole design and restart
2011-12-12T15:46:42  <Anilm3> poor Fluxid
2011-12-12T15:46:55  <besh> Use your old combat code then ;)
2011-12-12T15:47:15  <Fluxid> my old combat isn't good enough
2011-12-12T15:47:33  <Fluxid> (old == current submission)
2011-12-12T15:48:30  <Garf> I spent quite some time implementing xathis-like map control. Now my mu dropped because my ants are getting isolated and killed off.
2011-12-12T15:48:40  <Garf> "almost but not quite" :P
2011-12-12T15:48:46  <besh> fluxid: what are you trying to implement in the new one ? my combat don't have probablities that a lot other bots seem to have
2011-12-12T15:49:25  <besh> my combat works best on timed out bots :) In other words it assumes they are static.
2011-12-12T15:50:05  <thestinger> Garf: yeah, my combat isn't good enough to pull off map control
2011-12-12T15:50:24  <Antimony> me too
2011-12-12T15:50:34  <Antimony> it turns into a genius agaisnt tmied out bots
2011-12-12T15:51:03  <Fluxid> besh: i try to predict how likely enemy will move in given area in given direction
2011-12-12T15:51:06  <Fluxid> and try to predict how much my ant actually can do in killing enemy
2011-12-12T15:51:26  <Fluxid> or something like that
2011-12-12T15:51:32  <BenJackson> my code is 84k, which is more than I expected

2011-12-12T15:52:32  <BenJackson> 3k LOC 84kB
2011-12-12T15:52:40  <Fluxid> my sloccount: python:         933 (55.83%) ansic:          738 (44.17%)
2011-12-12T15:52:53  <thestinger> BenJackson: mine is pretty much 50% of that :P
2011-12-12T15:53:09  <thestinger> 1600 lines, 60kB
2011-12-12T15:53:10  <UncleVasya> 69.2kb current submission,  79.6kb coming version.
2011-12-12T15:53:11  <thestinger> so not really
2011-12-12T15:53:14  <BenJackson> the C++ starter is like 1000 by itself
2011-12-12T15:53:22  <thestinger> yeah but I deleted almost all of that
2011-12-12T15:53:57  <UncleVasya> 16.7 kb is my starterpack
2011-12-12T15:55:39  <besh> I would like to see some discussion on exploration instead of combat in the forum.
2011-12-12T15:55:54  <Antimony> My bot is 114kb in 25 files, but there's a lot of duplicated or unused code
2011-12-12T15:56:18  <BenJackson> I have mostly deleted my unused code
2011-12-12T15:56:23  <BenJackson> but I do have ifdef'd out visualizations
2011-12-12T15:56:36  <Antimony> For example, my bot has at least 2 BFSs and 2A*s in it
2011-12-12T15:56:54  <pairofdice> Holy ****

2011-12-12T15:57:00  <Antimony> what?
2011-12-12T15:57:03  <BenJackson> I have 2 BFS but no A*
2011-12-12T15:57:33  <Fluxid> I have dragons
2011-12-12T15:57:33  <Antimony> the problem is that with slight differences between each search, it's easier to just duplicate the code, then to try to generalize it
2011-12-12T15:57:45  <pairofdice> Yeah, true
2011-12-12T15:57:55  <Antimony> my food search and hill search in particular are near copies
2011-12-12T15:58:01  <BenJackson> when my primary bfs got too many options I made it a template that took functors
2011-12-12T15:58:09  <BenJackson> and my code actually got smaller *and* faster
2011-12-12T15:58:23  <Antimony> I guess I should try that
2011-12-12T15:58:26  <BenJackson> I only have a second BFS because the second one is a C++ iterator
2011-12-12T15:58:47  <BenJackson> so Bfs<PassabilityFunctor> begin(loc), end
2011-12-12T15:58:53  <thestinger> Antimony: that's what higher order functions are for :P
2011-12-12T15:59:02  <Antimony> yeah but I'm lazy
2011-12-12T15:59:08  <thestinger> same with me
2011-12-12T15:59:11  <BenJackson> yeah if I was using std::functions then I could probably fold all mine into 1
2011-12-12T15:59:20  <BenJackson> because instead of an iterator I'd just pass the code as an argument

2011-12-12T15:59:43  <BenJackson> although the iterator is fast for what it does
2011-12-12T16:00:09  <BenJackson> it can tell you the distance and direction to the source but it doesn't have to record most of that like the map-making one does
2011-12-12T16:00:25  <Garf> xathis on TCP is timing out
2011-12-12T16:00:53  <ikaros> tcp has many timouts

2011-12-12T16:01:09  <Antimony> I also have duplicated combat graph code because one version uses positions and one uses integer ids
2011-12-12T16:01:40  <Antimony> I should probably just stick with ints and make code to reassign ids to a graph
2011-12-12T16:02:54  <Antimony> is anyone using boost?
2011-12-12T16:03:43  <avdg> I would, but its making me more confused than its being helpful atm
2011-12-12T16:04:40  <avdg> and I think someone else on aichallenge's forum wanted to use boost as well (look it up)
2011-12-12T16:04:56  <ikaros> c++11 is kind of a boost :)

2011-12-12T16:05:20  <avdg> meh, I need a new laptop
2011-12-12T16:05:32  <ikaros> but yesterday i wanted to submit my first c++11 bot and had to realize the server uses gcc4.5 which doesnt implement lots of the nice stuff
2011-12-12T16:05:34  <avdg> osx is hurting me more than helping as well
2011-12-12T16:07:04  <iglo> hmm i like to implement a combat algo... but it would take too long time :/
2011-12-12T16:07:14  <Anilm3> avdg: linux power
2011-12-12T16:07:44  <avdg> Anilm3: yeah, I was thinking that too
2011-12-12T16:07:56  <Anilm3> you don't need to buy a new laptop for that!
2011-12-12T16:08:17  <avdg> no, but its too messy to do atm
2011-12-12T16:08:31  <Anilm3> Tell me about it, I have a mac
2011-12-12T16:08:56  <Anilm3> but I used osx for a while and hated it
2011-12-12T16:09:05  <avdg> my disk is almost full, and I have a server I wanted to install which has enough hd to store a backup
2011-12-12T16:09:31  <avdg> well, I loved osx simply because it was better than windows and easier than linux
2011-12-12T16:09:43  <avdg> but now I learned more, linux became more easy to use
2011-12-12T16:10:33  <Anilm3> avdg: in my experience
2011-12-12T16:10:40  <Anilm3> since 2005 or so
2011-12-12T16:10:55  <Anilm3> linux has not been difficult
2011-12-12T16:11:00  <Anilm3> before that, maybe
2011-12-12T16:11:11  <Anilm3> before that I had only tried sucky distros
2011-12-12T16:11:18  <avdg> :-)
2011-12-12T16:11:50  <Anilm3> also be careful with kde
2011-12-12T16:11:57  <Anilm3> and unity
2011-12-12T16:12:12  <Anilm3> they will scare the hell out of you!!
2011-12-12T16:12:27  <avdg> meh, I just need a browser and a console ;-)
2011-12-12T16:12:29  <ikaros> i dont like what they did to gnome too :)
2011-12-12T16:12:49  <Anilm3> ikaros: you mean the gnome shell stuff??
2011-12-12T16:12:53  <Anilm3> I don't like it either
2011-12-12T16:12:54  <ikaros> gnome3
2011-12-12T16:13:01  <ikaros> im glad my debian still has gnome2
2011-12-12T16:13:09  <avdg> yeah, I have plans for a new gui, but I'm always bad in implementing stuff (check my ai as proof)
2011-12-12T16:13:16  <ikaros> but on my laptop i have arch and there is gnome 3
2011-12-12T16:13:27  <avdg> and I have to learn everything on my own
2011-12-12T16:13:30  <ikaros> guess ill have to switch to xfce or such
2011-12-12T16:13:41  <Anilm3> go back to gnome2
2011-12-12T16:13:41  <Anilm3> !
2011-12-12T16:13:41  <ikaros> not sure yet
2011-12-12T16:13:44  <ikaros> well
2011-12-12T16:14:00  <avdg> maybe archlinux :p
2011-12-12T16:14:00  <ikaros> that's not so easy if your distro has switched to gnome 3
2011-12-12T16:14:33  <ikaros> im waiting for some guys that will fork gnome 2 and continue it :)
2011-12-12T16:14:37  <ikaros> cant take that long lol
2011-12-12T16:14:38  <avdg> (though I really would keep debian packages)
2011-12-12T16:14:51  <ikaros> debian and arch are both great
2011-12-12T16:14:59  <avdg> meh, I just hope I can create my own gui
2011-12-12T16:15:19  <avdg> I'm too good in theory, and bad in doing it
2011-12-12T16:15:24  <Anilm3> what do you mean create your own gui?
2011-12-12T16:15:28  <ikaros> i like how bleeding edge the arch packages are.. but it breaks more often :)
2011-12-12T16:15:56  <Anilm3> ikaros: me too, debian and arch are two sides of the same coin
2011-12-12T16:15:59  <avdg> I simply need a search bar to launch my app (and nothing more), a way to switch apps and my console :p
2011-12-12T16:16:01  <ikaros> if i wouldnt be so lazy i should probably use some *box and compiz on top
2011-12-12T16:16:04  <avdg> thats all I need
2011-12-12T16:16:09  <thestinger> arch only breaks if you break it :P
2011-12-12T16:16:20  <ikaros> hehe not really :)
2011-12-12T16:16:31  <ikaros> upgrades are enough sometimes :)
2011-12-12T16:16:41  <thestinger> I've run [testing] for 2 years and never had breakage
2011-12-12T16:16:48  <thestinger> you have to read the mailing list tho
2011-12-12T16:16:49  <ikaros> fascinating :)
2011-12-12T16:17:12  <ikaros> well.. i've had lots of -Syu which caused alot of trouble
2011-12-12T16:17:21  <ikaros> can be fixed always so no problem

2011-12-12T16:18:32  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-12T16:18:38  <thestinger> it's quite a bit different than it used to be
2011-12-12T16:18:43  <ikaros> until some weeks ago :) i decided to give it another shot on my laptop
2011-12-12T16:19:00  <thestinger> every package in [core] has to get sign-offs before they move it from [testing]
2011-12-12T16:19:02  <ikaros> funny thing was when i installed it switched to testing immediately
2011-12-12T16:19:09  <thestinger> so there's really no breakage in the core packages
2011-12-12T16:19:13  <ikaros> wanted to update with pacman 4
2011-12-12T16:19:24  <thestinger> pacman 4 is nice :)
2011-12-12T16:19:26  <ikaros> and the packages were signed and i hadnt the keys
2011-12-12T16:19:39  <ikaros> there was a script on the wiki to import them..
2011-12-12T16:19:43  <thestinger> yeah, there's no keyring package so it has to fetch them
2011-12-12T16:19:47  <thestinger> you don't need to use the script
2011-12-12T16:19:47  <ikaros> but it used elinks that wasnt installed lol
2011-12-12T16:19:53  <thestinger> just need to change the setting in pacman.conf
2011-12-12T16:19:55  <ikaros> was kind of funny to import this by hand..
2011-12-12T16:19:58  <ikaros> yea
2011-12-12T16:20:02  <ikaros> i realised that later
2011-12-12T16:20:03  <ikaros> lol
2011-12-12T16:20:40  <thestinger> imo, Ubuntu and Arch are probably equally unstable at any point in time
2011-12-12T16:20:44  <ikaros> thestinger, what wm do you use?
2011-12-12T16:20:55  <thestinger> but with Arch you deal with the upgrades slowly over time, not a massive change every 6 months
2011-12-12T16:20:58  <QuirionPT> is everyone allowed to participate in the final tournament or is it limited to TOP X players?
2011-12-12T16:20:58  <thestinger> ikaros: i3
2011-12-12T16:21:01  <ikaros> ubuntu has become a mess (imho)
2011-12-12T16:21:03  <ikaros> oh ok :)
2011-12-12T16:21:05  <thestinger> used awesomewm until recently
2011-12-12T16:21:11  <thestinger> i3 is amazing though :D
2011-12-12T16:21:19  <ikaros> when they changed to unity it became dirty
2011-12-12T16:21:27  <ikaros> unstable^3 unity is...

2011-12-12T16:21:42  <QuirionPT> ikaros, thanks
2011-12-12T16:21:43  <thestinger> I haven't really used Ubuntu since like 9.10
2011-12-12T16:21:59  <thestinger> I just installed it in a VM to see if a java zero-day worked in linux
2011-12-12T16:22:06  <thestinger> that was a few days ago
2011-12-12T16:22:08  <ikaros> its  installed on my gfs laptop :)
2011-12-12T16:22:34  <thestinger> in the 10 mins I used it, I ran into like 3 unity bugs
2011-12-12T16:22:52  <thestinger> and I checked out the software center thing, but it crashed when I tried to remove libreoffice
2011-12-12T16:23:02  <thestinger> so yeah... seems like they have taken a step backwards
2011-12-12T16:23:10  <QuirionPT> I have been using solely Ubuntu for the last 2 years. Has been quite okay and was a great help to avoid playing games and focusing on working/studying :)

2011-12-12T16:41:24  <janzert> just whatever your last submission is, is what will be used in the finals
2011-12-12T16:41:32  <ikaros> janzert, do we have to resubmit after deadline?
2011-12-12T16:41:33  <Anilm3> janzert: is the deadline fixed or can it be changed?
2011-12-12T16:41:36  <ikaros> ah
2011-12-12T16:41:39  <ikaros> forget that :)
2011-12-12T16:41:47  <janzert> the deadline is fixed
2011-12-12T16:41:48  <jab_bott> ok, phew, so I can frantically submit this week and try to improve it until Sunday!
2011-12-12T16:41:53  <Anilm3> :(
2011-12-12T16:42:02  <antimatroid1> janzert: are we resetting all the rankings? people were talking about just messing with the mu's the other day?
2011-12-12T16:42:16  <janzert> yes, their will be a complete reset
2011-12-12T16:42:25  <antimatroid1> good :)
2011-12-12T16:42:38  <jab_bott> I suppose I'd better be sure to not break something at the last minute
2011-12-12T16:42:39  <avdg> tip: just send your bot as early as possible, so most bugs/mistakes are out once the deadline passes ;-)
2011-12-12T16:43:12  <janzert> yeah, the very last submission made for planetwars ended up not compiling
2011-12-12T16:43:19  <janzert> poor guy
2011-12-12T16:43:20  <antimatroid1> counter tip: don't come up with a neat idea for your game tree like 7 hours before submissions close and then submit a buggy version of it
2011-12-12T16:43:40  <ikaros> :)
2011-12-12T16:43:55  <avdg> :p
2011-12-12T16:43:58  <pairofdice> counter-counter tip: please do exactly that
2011-12-12T16:44:01  <antimatroid1> i don't think my bot was actually any worse though, if anything it might have been better
2011-12-12T16:44:05  <jab_bott> janzert: wouldn't it revert to the last-known-good (i.e. compiled and passed tests) version in that case?
2011-12-12T16:44:29  <janzert> in planetwars it didn't, I think it might now but I'm not positive
2011-12-12T16:44:40  <jab_bott> I really wish I'd worked on combat much sooner now so I could have more time for feedback and refinement
2011-12-12T16:44:51  <janzert> don't remember for sure if that changed or not
2011-12-12T16:45:14  * avdg wonders if the site could crash just before the deadline

2011-12-12T16:45:33  <avdg> there are too many server crashes at ai-class already
2011-12-12T16:45:47  <avdg> garf: are you belgian?
2011-12-12T16:45:55  <avdg> ah you are
2011-12-12T16:46:11  <Garf> yes, thats why I made that reference
2011-12-12T16:46:21  <avdg> :-)
2011-12-12T16:48:21  <jab_bott> ahh.. another ai-class student :)
2011-12-12T16:48:31  <avdg> just a watcher
2011-12-12T16:48:39  <avdg> I'm too frustrated to study well
2011-12-12T16:48:41  <avdg> :-)
2011-12-12T16:49:03  <jab_bott> that's how I heard about this aichallenge, through searching since I've been doing the ai-class
2011-12-12T16:49:28  <avdg> I heared on twitter
2011-12-12T16:49:34  <jab_bott> my bot doesn't exactly employ much of the stuff from ai-class though
2011-12-12T16:50:12  <avdg> too many people promising they will complete the course, but I didn't hear any1 once week 2 started
2011-12-12T16:50:14  <pairofdice> Oh right, deadline in 2 hours
2011-12-12T16:50:17  <jab_bott> the c-version is now super-fast! I'm struggling with making my ants spread out though, they keep getting stuck to water
2011-12-12T16:50:36  <jab_bott> avdg: I'm still on for 100% on the course
2011-12-12T16:50:44  <pairofdice> Yeah 100% here too
2011-12-12T16:50:50  <pairofdice> It's a good course
2011-12-12T16:51:04  <avdg> I'm still ready to listen, I'm lacking math skills to complete the course
2011-12-12T16:51:09  <jab_bott> I got 98% and 95% on two of the homeworks, but they discard the two worst scores, so technically I could still get 100
2011-12-12T16:51:26  <pairofdice> There's hardly any math required, some basic division in Bayes
2011-12-12T16:51:37  <avdg> probability kills me
2011-12-12T16:52:00  <avdg> and rarely time
2011-12-12T16:52:07  <avdg> to study it peaceful
2011-12-12T16:52:20  <avdg> (though I have no job atm)
2011-12-12T16:53:05  <jab_bott> I keep getting annoyed by poorly specified questions, like that's the minimum value for something, and the *real* correct answer is that the value must be >14 and the answer used for marking is 15 - but nobody said it must be an integer - things like taht
2011-12-12T16:53:34  <avdg> yeah, that was especially at the start

2011-12-12T17:37:09  <jab_bott> by the way - I've been testing my bot on this map: maps/cell_maze/cell_maze_p04_14.map - and I've noticed a significant advantage to playing in player-3 position - when I play against my older bots I can only just beat them when they are in spot 3 and when my latest bot plays in spot 3 it kicks-ass
2011-12-12T17:37:43  <jab_bott> aren't they supposed to be equal?
2011-12-12T17:38:31  <amstan> jab_bott: you have something wrong with your code then
2011-12-12T17:38:33  <pairofdice> The maps are equal, but your bots might not be
2011-12-12T17:38:48  <pairofdice> ie, the bots have a bias
2011-12-12T17:39:13  <amstan> jab_bott: your bot should play exactly the same from all positions given that you have the same opponents in the other positions(and given that they play the same too)

2011-12-12T17:41:14  <amstan> jab_bott: in your language, what does -3%10 equal to?
2011-12-12T17:41:16  <jab_bott> I pick directions by picking a random direction, then cycling from there until a max-desirable direction is found, so if none is found the left-over direction is random
2011-12-12T17:41:30  <BenJackson> I may have finally built a bot capable of consistently beating my previous version
2011-12-12T17:41:50  <jab_bott> amstan: for wrapping I do (x + width) % width and (y + height) % height

2011-12-12T17:42:28  <BenJackson> I've run into maps like that
2011-12-12T17:42:33  <BenJackson> where the symmetry is all "north", too
2011-12-12T17:42:39  <BenJackson> so there's basically no difference
2011-12-12T17:42:43  <BenJackson> never did figure out why
2011-12-12T17:43:12  <jab_bott> do all bots start with the same player_seed?
2011-12-12T17:43:21  <BenJackson> they do if you pass it to the engine
2011-12-12T17:43:23  <BenJackson> not sure otherwise

2011-12-12T18:18:37  <amstan> they do, but only for that progress thing
2011-12-12T18:19:29  <amstan> most of those quizes i fail at first try, because maybe i didn't get the question, have no idea how to do the question or i'm just too lazy to do it
2011-12-12T18:19:53  <amstan> they should really use the last attempt instead
2011-12-12T18:20:35  <ronchaine> Then you could just answer anything->see explanation->answer correct.

2011-12-12T18:21:19  <amstan> yes, but i don't see how the quiz mark is relevant if some of the questions are designed to be impossible to do with no previous knowlege

2011-12-12T18:21:58  <amstan> if they want to have it as a student tool, students should be able to use it as they want, as a way to track progress of stuff they understand at present

2011-12-12T18:55:39  <avdg> hmm, are these videos public?
2011-12-12T18:55:43  <BenJackson> no
2011-12-12T18:55:51  <BenJackson> the urls are not locked down, but they're not advertised
2011-12-12T18:55:52  <amstan> that would have been nice
2011-12-12T18:56:05  <BenJackson> same topics, same guys, but with prepared slides
2011-12-12T18:56:07  <BenJackson> working examples
2011-12-12T18:56:10  <amstan> still, the idea of most classes is that you use outside resources too, like books and stuff
2011-12-12T18:56:10  <avdg> well, I know they released only some of the videos
2011-12-12T18:56:15  <BenJackson> and a class of students pointing out confusing/wrong things
2011-12-12T18:56:18  <amstan> i have a bad habit of not using books
2011-12-12T18:56:19  <BenJackson> also high def
2011-12-12T18:56:22  <BenJackson> and not interrupted by quizzes
2011-12-12T18:56:29  <avdg> :p
2011-12-12T18:56:42  <BenJackson> I need to keep an eye on the used book price
2011-12-12T18:56:45  <avdg> or with other words, its a better way to fall asleep
2011-12-12T18:56:50  <BenJackson> I'm hoping it will crash after ai-class so I can pick it up
2011-12-12T18:57:57  <amstan> i'm still undecided what course to do next term
2011-12-12T18:58:29  <BenJackson> people who took ml-class really liked it
2011-12-12T18:58:34  <BenJackson> but there's overlap with ai-class
2011-12-12T18:58:54  <rwest_> is there any way to put the topics on the forum in some kind of logical order?
2011-12-12T18:59:01  <rwest_> like by date of last reply?
2011-12-12T18:59:05  <amstan> i eventually want to learn that stuff properly, but not for any short term stuff
2011-12-12T18:59:08  <Garf> BenJackson: yeah, I tried both, and quickly picked ml in favor of ai

2011-12-12T18:59:16  <amstan> i want something that can benefit me in short term
2011-12-12T18:59:29  <Garf> ml-class pacing, questions, exercises are excellent imho
2011-12-12T18:59:37  <rwest_> BenJackson: I guess that works, wish it was just normal lol
2011-12-12T18:59:44  <Garf> wish it went deeper and broader (even if not in the class, but with pointers) sometimes
2011-12-12T19:00:22  <BenJackson> rwest_: I happened to just click on that when you asked
2011-12-12T19:01:34  <amstan> there was this webpage with all the free stanford courses for next term, anyone have a link?
2011-12-12T19:01:43  <amstan> there was also a subreddit on it, which might have that link

2011-12-12T19:06:34  <avdg> :-) looks like I have 4/6 right (I didn't answer 2/6)
2011-12-12T19:06:36  <amstan> avdg: the homework just closed

2011-12-12T19:15:38  <avdg> well, if you count the coverage of enemies on 1 map and have a system to cover at least 2 ants on each "safe" direction, you would have a pretty good one to start with ;-)
2011-12-12T19:16:21  <rwest_> the main issue is I don't calculate safe moves only unsafe ones really
2011-12-12T19:17:55  <avdg> meh I wouldn't implement it in my current bot, because js is too slow to do it

2011-12-12T19:26:45  <Antimony> Is your syemmtry system similar to the one on the forums?
2011-12-12T19:27:35  <BenJackson> nope!
2011-12-12T19:27:45  <BenJackson> I'd call that the brute force method
2011-12-12T19:28:00  <BenJackson> very nice visualization of how it works, though
2011-12-12T19:29:11  <Antimony> oh, so there's a better way? I was doing brute force too

2011-12-12T19:30:49  <BenJackson> I implemented the calculation but still haven't used it
2011-12-12T19:31:37  <avdg> I have implemented it in my c++ bot, but not tested it yet, its currently underestimating
2011-12-12T19:32:11  <Antimony> In this replay, my bot thinks white has an extra food starting around turn 123http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=210389&user=3875
2011-12-12T19:32:16  <BenJackson> mine resets if it doesn't see an ant appear at a hill for a few turns
2011-12-12T19:32:31  <BenJackson> if it thinks it has food and no ant appears it thinks it knows my hills are dead
2011-12-12T19:32:34  <Antimony> mine concludes that a hill was razed because it expected spawning
2011-12-12T19:32:34  <BenJackson> but it also doesn't use that
2011-12-12T19:32:55  <Antimony> I guess I should make it fail safe, rather than fail deadly

2011-12-12T19:33:06  <avdg> thats dangerous
2011-12-12T19:33:08  <Antimony> that's what I'm trying to figure out
2011-12-12T19:33:17  <Antimony> there must be a bug somewhere
2011-12-12T19:34:33  <avdg> do you take the number of spawned ants into account?

2011-12-12T20:06:01  <Antimony> My bot moved an ant onto the hill, but the actual bot moved it away, so when a new ant spawned, my bot didn't recognize it as new
2011-12-12T20:06:24  <Antimony> oh ok
2011-12-12T20:06:44  <Antimony> I'm new to git. Why doesn't it automatically remove the old version if you rename?
2011-12-12T20:06:57  *** roflmao <roflmao!~jstrong@189.229.217.18> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-12-12T20:07:07  <avdg> git only knows about renames by guessing and comparing files, renaming in git equals 2 "internal" operations (well, to keep things abstracted and simple)
2011-12-12T20:07:10  <BenJackson> rename in git is add+delete
2011-12-12T20:07:15  <Antimony> oh
2011-12-12T20:07:20  <BenJackson> renames are detected dynamically every time (every time you merge, log, etc)
2011-12-12T20:07:35  <BenJackson> there's a shortcut git command that does both steps for you at once
2011-12-12T20:07:41  <Wraithan> git mv
2011-12-12T20:08:35  <Antimony> I guess stored food detection is difficult if the moves being made are not what you expect
2011-12-12T20:08:49  <Antimony> at least it's not a bug in my boy
2011-12-12T20:08:52  <Antimony> my bot
2011-12-12T20:09:01  <Wraithan> My least favorite thing to explain to people who don't know git is that git has no idea what a directory is, it has paths to files and directories are an implementation detail. Which is why you can't add an empty dir lol.
2011-12-12T20:09:14  <avdg> there are some constrains, but once you know them, you shouldn't hit strange moves
2011-12-12T20:09:30  <Antimony> no, I'm running it on a replay from a different bot
2011-12-12T20:09:46  <avdg> ah, in that case, you are always underestimating
2011-12-12T20:09:58  <Antimony> or overestimating in this case
2011-12-12T20:10:16  <avdg> in the case you have a visual on all hills and see nothing spawns, you can reset the hive count
2011-12-12T20:10:20  <BenJackson> actually I don't rely on hive spawning at all for counting
2011-12-12T20:10:40  <BenJackson> I only observe the lack of ants on hills over time as indicating I should reset (in case of other bugs leading to drift)
2011-12-12T20:10:45  <avdg> overestimating would do more bad in most cases here
2011-12-12T20:11:01  <Antimony> but in this case, the bot thought there was no spawn when there was
2011-12-12T20:11:06  <Antimony> thus overestimation
2011-12-12T20:11:17  <Antimony> I'm not really sure how you can avoid that
2011-12-12T20:11:21  <BenJackson> why do you need spawn?
2011-12-12T20:12:03  <BenJackson> hive = food eaten - (dead ants + (live ants - original ants))
2011-12-12T20:12:46  <Antimony> you can't always see your ants deaths
2011-12-12T20:12:53  <BenJackson> yes you can
2011-12-12T20:13:02  <BenJackson> you see your ant deaths even if you don't see the square otherwise
2011-12-12T20:13:04  <avdg> and its also kinda tricky to determine if an ant was spawned from the hill
2011-12-12T20:13:13  <Antimony> really?
2011-12-12T20:13:16  <avdg> because you don't know the moves of the ant

2011-12-12T20:14:03  <BenJackson> that's why I just read the damn game engine
2011-12-12T20:14:06  <Antimony> I don't think that was in the specification
2011-12-12T20:14:09  <BenJackson> the specs are not precise enough
2011-12-12T20:14:55  <avdg> :p my assumption was right here
2011-12-12T20:15:04  <avdg> I hope I won't get a wrong assumption
2011-12-12T20:15:20  <avdg> I also wonder what happens with dead ants in view radius of the dead ant
2011-12-12T20:15:58  <avdg> for example you collide against an enemy, would you also see that you killed the enemy
2011-12-12T20:16:09  <Antimony> Oh wait, it is in the specs. I guess I fail at reading
2011-12-12T20:16:15  <Antimony> well that will make things ismpler
2011-12-12T20:16:19  <QuirionPT> when an ant moves and dies does it get to see the map anyway?
2011-12-12T20:16:28  <Antimony> no
2011-12-12T20:16:46  <BenJackson> no, just the death of that ant
2011-12-12T20:16:47  <Garf> just its own square, if I read that correctly
2011-12-12T20:16:52  <BenJackson> not even its square
2011-12-12T20:16:54  <BenJackson> just its death
2011-12-12T20:16:58  <Antimony> just the carcass
2011-12-12T20:17:01  <BenJackson> multiple deaths can occur on a square
2011-12-12T20:17:08  <BenJackson> and in the same turn something else (an ant, a hill) can be there

2011-12-12T20:18:35  <BenJackson> I had ripped the dead ant list out of Square (in the C++ starteR) so I had to re-add counting them
2011-12-12T20:18:39  <BenJackson> but I only count, I don't save them
2011-12-12T20:19:05  <Wraithan> I removed dead ant stuff from the python lib

2011-12-12T20:54:59  <jab_bott> Antimony: why don't you use the fact that the hill no longer exists or the ant no longer exists to track ant/hill removal?
2011-12-12T20:55:29  <jab_bott> rwest_: how do you get your ants to spread out so nicely?
2011-12-12T20:56:31  <jab_bott> mine subtract values from the heat-map I use for exploration so that bunched up ants tend to move away from each other, but when it gets very crowded they get confused and start sticking to walls, causing further problems
2011-12-12T21:05:32  <thestinger> jab_bott: you're talking about filling space to search for food?
2011-12-12T21:05:45  <jab_bott> thestinger: yeah
2011-12-12T21:06:11  <jab_bott> walls==water :D
2011-12-12T21:06:21  <thestinger> I've experimented with it a bit and I can get a nice behavior to emerge now
2011-12-12T21:06:39  <thestinger> I started with just a multi-source BFS from all non-visible locations
2011-12-12T21:07:00  <jab_bott> I think perhaps they need to look further afield, rather than their immediate surroundings, because often they move one way then move straight back
2011-12-12T21:07:09  <thestinger> and I stop multiple ants from going to a location (I propagate locations _and_ distance through that BFS) and then tag the nearby locations of a target as also taken
2011-12-12T21:07:35  <thestinger> and with a bunch of random hacks and tweaks it turned into a nice spread for foraging
2011-12-12T21:08:19  <thestinger> basically I maximize the area that is visible
2011-12-12T21:08:33  <thestinger> but I get it to happen indirectly
2011-12-12T21:08:41  <jab_bott> thestinger: I have something similar for initial exploration, it works great, but after the outer ants have explored nicely, when the food collection is too much, basically when it gets too crowded around my hill the ones in the crowd get stuck
2011-12-12T21:08:59  <thestinger> oh, because they don't have a path to a target?
2011-12-12T21:10:06  <jab_bott> no, they're not searching for a path, it's just that with so many crowded up they move one way to get away from the crowd only to find there's another crowd in that direction too and so they move back again as the distances change
2011-12-12T21:10:20  <thestinger> ah, I don't actually make them spread out
2011-12-12T21:10:38  <thestinger> the behavior emerges because they won't get the same targets
2011-12-12T21:10:43  <thestinger> for food searching
2011-12-12T21:10:45  <jab_bott> and the ones on the edge stop spreading out once the exploration frontier is empty (i.e. the whole map has been seen at some point regardless of its current visibility)

2011-12-12T21:12:40  <thestinger> I have two types of exploration
2011-12-12T21:13:03  <thestinger> there's the food gathering part (which tries to maximize the visible area) and it doesn't really need very many ants
2011-12-12T21:13:15  <thestinger> so I have a bunch leftover at the end to attack enemy hills, or search for them
2011-12-12T21:13:52  <thestinger> I used to limit the number of ants used for foraging, but now that I mark off locations around a target as taken in addition to the target, it limits itself
2011-12-12T21:18:57  <jab_bott> ok.. I see. I think I'm going to try looking a bit further afield for a suitable direction, that might help the ants get past local valleys in the heat-map
2011-12-12T21:20:15  <jab_bott> or maybe just adding a bias away from the hill and requiring a greater step difference to override it
2011-12-12T21:21:01  <Antimony> maybe you aren't propogating your heat map enough

2011-12-12T21:33:15  <thestinger> I use this for coming up with offensive moves, positioning, etc.

2011-12-12T21:57:12  <roflmao> or the other tiling window managers
2011-12-12T21:57:30  <thestinger> well, it's a manual tiler basically
2011-12-12T21:57:35  <roflmao> ah cool
2011-12-12T21:57:40  <roflmao> does it integrate easily with gnome?
2011-12-12T21:57:44  <roflmao> i don't want to lose my taskbar
2011-12-12T21:57:48  <roflmao> with all my app shortcuts
2011-12-12T21:57:51  <thestinger> dunno
2011-12-12T21:57:56  <thestinger> try dmenu, it's better :P
2011-12-12T21:58:26  <roflmao> ugluy
2011-12-12T21:58:55  <roflmao> :P
2011-12-12T21:59:08  <thestinger> not ugly, you only see it when you launch something anyway
2011-12-12T21:59:39  <roflmao> thing I don't really liker about tiling managers
2011-12-12T21:59:43  <roflmao> is I have a 21" screen
2011-12-12T21:59:50  <roflmao> so if I tile things they'll all be super small
2011-12-12T22:00:00  <roflmao> so I end up just using the tiling manager workspaces
2011-12-12T22:00:04  <roflmao> which is identical to using the gnome ones
2011-12-12T22:00:20  <thestinger> you don't have to tile everything
2011-12-12T22:00:51  <roflmao> yeah but i still easily fill up all 1-0 keys of workspaces
2011-12-12T22:00:56  <thestinger> my monitor is wide enough that I pretty much always want it split down the middle
2011-12-12T22:00:58  <roflmao> then I'm like "uhh err which one was I on?"
2011-12-12T22:01:02  <thestinger> so I don't really "tile"
2011-12-12T22:01:09  <thestinger> I have a vertical split
2011-12-12T22:01:14  <thestinger> and then everything in stacks/tabs
2011-12-12T22:01:34  <roflmao> also
2011-12-12T22:01:37  <roflmao> what about app shortcuts?
2011-12-12T22:01:43  <thestinger> like what?
2011-12-12T22:01:46  <roflmao> using alt+everything = huge conflict possibilities
2011-12-12T22:01:48  <roflmao> like photoshop ;P
2011-12-12T22:01:53  <thestinger> super+d == dmenu
2011-12-12T22:02:10  <thestinger> or whatever
2011-12-12T22:02:18  <thestinger> so if I want to start gimp
2011-12-12T22:02:34  <thestinger> <SUPER>dgimp<ENTER>
2011-12-12T22:02:50  <thestinger> it has menu based (dmenu :P) autocompletion

2011-12-12T22:04:03  <roflmao> nice
2011-12-12T22:04:06  <roflmao> that does sound nice :P
2011-12-12T22:04:42  <thestinger> it's a lightweight version of quicksilver basically
2011-12-12T22:04:46  <roflmao> ooooooooooooooooooh
2011-12-12T22:04:47  <roflmao> stacking
2011-12-12T22:04:48  <roflmao> i see
2011-12-12T22:04:50  <roflmao> thats fkin awesome
2011-12-12T22:05:38  <thestinger> http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_the_container_layout
2011-12-12T22:05:46  <thestinger> their example is pretty silly
2011-12-12T22:06:11  <thestinger> you can also resize containers/splits manually ofc
2011-12-12T22:07:07  <thestinger> window hints are respected by default, so stuff like a firefox dialog (page info, preferences) is floating by default

2011-12-12T22:53:28  <antimatroid1> on the discussion earlier about the same bots playing the same, early in beta i found it was very hard to do that
2011-12-12T22:53:50  <antimatroid1> the wrapping makes it hard for all bots to choose the same targets with equal paths
