2011-02-13T00:21:53  <antimatroid> hmmm map files are going to be the transpose of what is passed to bots
2011-02-13T00:22:00  <antimatroid> that is going to confuse a lot of people
2011-02-13T00:22:06  <antimatroid> or just me?
2011-02-13T00:22:30  <antimatroid> it's not very intuitive for debugging
2011-02-13T00:23:03  <antimatroid> well sure you can transpose what you print, but bleh, i stand by my original argument, row,col is superior
2011-02-13T00:38:55  <McLeopold> hi
2011-02-13T00:39:09  <antimatroid> hey
2011-02-13T00:39:22  <antimatroid> can i run my thoughts on food bonus by you?
2011-02-13T00:40:06  <antimatroid> for each example suppose the game ends before the turn limit and with no participating players left in the game
2011-02-13T00:40:07  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-13T00:40:56  <antimatroid> each bots score freezes when they die right? I don't think the bonus should be shared if it's 2 or more bots finishing because they crashed or timed out, as non could have continued on to round up the food bonus
2011-02-13T00:41:24  <antimatroid> and then if that's fine, what about a bot that died because it collided the last of its ants?
2011-02-13T00:42:03  <McLeopold> my thought is to reward good ai, not good programming
2011-02-13T00:42:21  <antimatroid> i agree with that
2011-02-13T00:42:33  <McLeopold> this shouldn't be a coding contest, I think jeff might agree, since he is targeting new players
2011-02-13T00:42:45  <flag> git newbie here, is there any way I can download just the ants directory?
2011-02-13T00:42:53  <McLeopold> no?
2011-02-13T00:43:02  <flag> thought so
2011-02-13T00:43:14  <antimatroid> i swear you can
2011-02-13T00:43:22  <antimatroid> what's the link?

2011-02-13T00:44:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what if an ant times out while their non-move takes out the last remaining player (almost never going to happen, but just trying to check edge cases)
2011-02-13T00:44:21  <McLeopold> flag: it doesn't look like you can
2011-02-13T00:44:33  <antimatroid> downloads top right?
2011-02-13T00:44:34  <flag> okay, I'll just grab the whole thing then
2011-02-13T00:44:38  <antimatroid> .zip
2011-02-13T00:44:51  <flag> I think that downloads the whole aichallenge branch
2011-02-13T00:45:04  <McLeopold> a git clone is going to get all, plus the history
2011-02-13T00:45:05  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2011-02-13T00:45:19  <McLeopold> I don't think you'll  need to worry about space, it's all text.
2011-02-13T00:45:35  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm thinking there should be no special cases
2011-02-13T00:45:54  <McLeopold> if your bot is in the game, you can gain points, if it is not in the game, you can't
2011-02-13T00:46:45  <McLeopold> We could say that the food bonus can only be given to bots that don't crash or time out
2011-02-13T00:46:46  <antimatroid> so does battle get resolved and they draw? or does the timeout ant die then the other player wins before the battle gets resolved?
2011-02-13T00:47:09  <antimatroid> ^^ if that was easy i think that might be the fairest
2011-02-13T00:47:20  <McLeopold> the timeout would take the bot out of the game before move resolution
2011-02-13T00:47:20  <antimatroid> i agree with not punishing people too  much though
2011-02-13T00:47:29  <McLeopold> so, the move wouldn't get resolved
2011-02-13T00:47:38  <antimatroid> i'm happy with that
2011-02-13T00:47:40  <McLeopold> the last bot didn't time out, so they get the food bonus
2011-02-13T00:47:50  <antimatroid> feel free to leave it as is
2011-02-13T00:47:52  <McLeopold> let me check if the engine does that
2011-02-13T00:47:55  <antimatroid> :p
2011-02-13T00:48:29  <antimatroid> i've been updating the spec for a while with small things, i just did a save of it if anyone cares :)
2011-02-13T00:48:37  <McLeopold> nope, i need to put in an extra game over check
2011-02-13T00:48:50  <McLeopold> I've been reading it.
2011-02-13T00:48:56  <McLeopold> I might do some editing later
2011-02-13T00:49:08  <antimatroid> i have one last example for you :P
2011-02-13T00:49:27  <antimatroid> 2 ants draw normally through battle, but a third died from colliding itself to death
2011-02-13T00:49:48  <antimatroid> i think that should be a 3 way draw for the bonus
2011-02-13T00:49:54  <McLeopold> so, I saw the remark about map input being different from move input, I agree, it may not be consistent enough
2011-02-13T00:50:11  <antimatroid> map file to move input?
2011-02-13T00:50:19  <McLeopold> it doesn't matter how you die
2011-02-13T00:50:26  <McLeopold> no special cases
2011-02-13T00:50:39  <antimatroid> yep, just making sure it's like that, i did say my preference is as such :P

2011-02-13T00:53:17  <McLeopold> yes, all food on the map, including all ants of crashed players count
2011-02-13T00:53:43  <antimatroid> cool

2011-02-13T00:55:06  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-13T00:55:19  <antimatroid> i think i just did
2011-02-13T00:55:28  <McLeopold> because if we don't send the map picture, it still makes sense
2011-02-13T00:55:42  <McLeopold> I'm still on the fence about it.
2011-02-13T00:55:56  <antimatroid> oh? i thought you agreed on char maps
2011-02-13T00:55:59  <McLeopold> My data size tests weren't that robust.
2011-02-13T00:56:28  <McLeopold> I think I may have underestimated the amount of data needed for map data.
2011-02-13T00:56:48  <antimatroid> if we didn't have fog of war we'd be doing it all anyway
2011-02-13T00:57:04  <antimatroid> i don't think it will be too expensive, and the visualiser string can still be the original format
2011-02-13T00:57:20  <McLeopold> we'd be sending the map picture once, and the changes only each turn
2011-02-13T00:58:19  <McLeopold> do you code in C much?
2011-02-13T00:58:32  <antimatroid> only c++ why?
2011-02-13T00:58:52  <antimatroid> i treat c++ like it's c with classes most of the time
2011-02-13T00:59:15  <McLeopold> is it a big deal to check a string for a variable length token delimited by a space?
2011-02-13T00:59:27  <McLeopold> I'm thinking about the 'P' designator for parameters
2011-02-13T00:59:38  <antimatroid> hmmm not sure
2011-02-13T00:59:57  <McLeopold> I'm wondering if it would be faster and easier for all languages if they could just check the first char for a 'P'
2011-02-13T01:00:07  <McLeopold> python doesn't matter
2011-02-13T01:00:17  <antimatroid> they already need to find ready and go right?
2011-02-13T01:00:21  <McLeopold> but other people might rather have the single char designators
2011-02-13T01:00:24  <antimatroid> about that, ready could really just be go :P
2011-02-13T01:00:35  <McLeopold> yep
2011-02-13T01:00:54  <McLeopold> it made the starter bot look nicer
2011-02-13T01:01:10  <antimatroid> i also noticed visualiser input is using W for walk, i think that and bot output should just be consistent, bu ti don't like O either
2011-02-13T01:01:28  <McLeopold> what's wrong with O
2011-02-13T01:01:34  <antimatroid> it looks a lot like zero
2011-02-13T01:02:00  <McLeopold> but it's position is only taken by letters so far
2011-02-13T01:02:18  <antimatroid> ?

2011-02-13T01:06:02  <antimatroid> we could really make go and end G and E then
2011-02-13T01:06:41  <McLeopold> if we thought about this in terms of future contests, it would be nice to keep the "game" data to the set of letters, and other data to symbols maybe
2011-02-13T01:07:01  <McLeopold> # is comment
2011-02-13T01:07:23  <McLeopold> = is parameter?
2011-02-13T01:07:39  <McLeopold> . is go?
2011-02-13T01:08:01  <McLeopold> i never liked go
2011-02-13T01:08:14  <McLeopold> it was 2 characters and everything else was 1
2011-02-13T01:08:44  <McLeopold> it is still dead simple to parse
2011-02-13T01:08:58  <antimatroid> i don't know about that
2011-02-13T01:09:12  <antimatroid> it'd be very unintuitive and a pain to write examples for
2011-02-13T01:09:29  <McLeopold> because a period is small?
2011-02-13T01:09:57  <antimatroid> you can usually work out one letter ones by the first letter
2011-02-13T01:10:07  <antimatroid> for that you need to memorise a bunch of links
2011-02-13T01:10:27  <McLeopold> links?
2011-02-13T01:10:40  <antimatroid> go == ., parameter == = etc.
2011-02-13T01:11:05  <McLeopold> yeah, but 'go' has no more meaning that '.'
2011-02-13T01:11:18  <McLeopold> what was tron like?
2011-02-13T01:11:52  <McLeopold> how about 'end transmission'
2011-02-13T01:11:59  <McLeopold> or 'engage'
2011-02-13T01:12:05  <McLeopold> or 'over and out'
2011-02-13T01:14:57  <McLeopold> so, let's keep it the same.  ready can be go
2011-02-13T01:15:48  <McLeopold> I'm also going to do more work on the bot protocol, cause I'm thinking changes only is still better.
2011-02-13T01:16:11  <McLeopold> We are sending a lot of data, I'd hate for a bot to use all it's time just updating the state.
2011-02-13T01:17:46  <antimatroid> tron just required you output N, E, S or W
2011-02-13T01:17:53  <antimatroid> as you had to move and had onto one moving part
2011-02-13T01:18:56  <antimatroid> a bot would have to be pretty stupid to spend the whole turn updating the state at the start of the turn
2011-02-13T01:19:17  <antimatroid> and you don't have the same information issues with simulating turns, as you don't get more information, only get to change how much you think you can se
2011-02-13T01:19:43  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be worried about that causing performance issues, i'm more worried about it being unecessarily complicated
2011-02-13T01:22:35  <McLeopold> what do you think our max map size will be
2011-02-13T01:22:56  <McLeopold> if we have 200 turns, over 200 in size doesn't make a lot of sense
2011-02-13T01:23:14  <McLeopold> how many time should an ant be able to cross the map?
2011-02-13T01:23:51  <antimatroid> that's why i've suggested a starting turn limit of 1000
2011-02-13T01:24:08  <antimatroid> i think we could get away with a time limit of 2-3 seconds, if some games have 8 players so be it
2011-02-13T01:24:30  <antimatroid> this coming from someone almost certain to want as much time as possible
2011-02-13T01:25:25  <antimatroid> i think 4, 6, 8 and 9 (maybe not even 8?) would be good numbers of players to pick between
2011-02-13T01:25:34  <antimatroid> although some larger games on tcp would be cool
2011-02-13T01:26:09  <antimatroid> McLeopolds famous crazy maps server with a known increased turn limit? :P

2011-02-13T01:27:34  <Prillicy> added a signature on the forums finally
2011-02-13T01:27:35  <antimatroid> i would be more interested in the tcp server with option 1 :P
2011-02-13T01:27:42  <antimatroid> signatures are horrible :P
2011-02-13T01:27:53  <McLeopold> Okay, antimatroid, just make your sig: "option 1"

2011-02-13T01:28:09  <Prillicy> but option one is not horrible

2011-02-13T01:29:05  <Prillicy> I should so do that
2011-02-13T01:29:05  <antimatroid> i should make an irc sig with option 1
2011-02-13T01:29:21  <McLeopold> okay, seriously, about map size
2011-02-13T01:29:25  <Prillicy> 1
2011-02-13T01:29:30  <McLeopold> somewhat tied to turn limit
2011-02-13T01:29:35  <antimatroid> start too big
2011-02-13T01:29:43  <antimatroid> 100 turns and 200x200?
2011-02-13T01:29:43  <Prillicy> I was thinking that you really only have 1 option here
2011-02-13T01:29:45  <Prillicy> ;)
2011-02-13T01:29:52  <antimatroid> 1000*
2011-02-13T01:29:53  <McLeopold> must have enough turns to cross the map twice?
2011-02-13T01:30:16  <antimatroid> i think you want even more than that if you want people to finish the game
2011-02-13T01:30:26  <antimatroid> and it's boring if most games don't
2011-02-13T01:30:26  <McLeopold> thrice?
2011-02-13T01:30:28  <Prillicy> I thought you weren't going to have a turn limit....at least, a noticeable one
2011-02-13T01:30:44  <antimatroid> McLeopold: start too big with what we can realistically handle, then find the magic number later
2011-02-13T01:30:46  <Prillicy> so your turn limit should be like 1e12
2011-02-13T01:30:57  <McLeopold> if I have a map of 256x256, then the turn limit should be at least...
2011-02-13T01:30:59  <antimatroid> Prillicy: we have finite computing power
2011-02-13T01:31:00  <McLeopold> 1024?

2011-02-13T02:33:16  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yeah, it's just that paint algorithm pretty much
2011-02-13T02:33:41  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I think spawn radius should be capped at 3
2011-02-13T02:33:54  <antimatroid> because otherwise it happens through walls, which makes no sense
2011-02-13T02:34:06  <antimatroid> it kind of makes sense for walls to not be so high that you can see and battle over them
2011-02-13T02:34:30  <McLeopold> it's water
2011-02-13T02:34:34  <antimatroid> oh, are you talking about on a discrete grid?
2011-02-13T02:34:45  <antimatroid> even then it doesn't make sense for food to be consumer from the other side if you can't walk over
2011-02-13T02:34:50  <McLeopold> what do you mean by discrete?
2011-02-13T02:35:09  <antimatroid> well you can do voronoi diagrams in continous space
2011-02-13T02:35:13  <antimatroid> like R^2
2011-02-13T02:35:15  <pyro-> your trying to make it make sense? it doesn't make sense at all for food to turn into ants when you get near it in the first place :D
2011-02-13T02:35:44  <McLeopold> R^2?
2011-02-13T02:36:01  <antimatroid> cartesian product of the real numbers
2011-02-13T02:36:06  <antimatroid> (x,y) where they are real numbers
2011-02-13T02:36:07  <antimatroid> 2d plan
2011-02-13T02:36:08  <antimatroid> e
2011-02-13T02:36:37  <antimatroid> you can even do it in R^n if you want
2011-02-13T02:37:10  <McLeopold> discrete grid means we don't do floating point?
2011-02-13T02:37:43  <antimatroid> i was asking what you were asking about voronoi diagrams for?
2011-02-13T02:37:57  <McLeopold> I know, but I need to learn some lingo
2011-02-13T02:38:15  <antimatroid> were you curious for finding shortest paths in this?
2011-02-13T02:39:38  <antimatroid> there are 2 algorithms i will be using that paint for this, one to be used to find a players shortest path somewhere and another to find which squares which people can get to first
2011-02-13T02:39:43  <McLeopold> I'm sure voronoi, and delaunay triangulation will both come in handy.
2011-02-13T02:40:10  <McLeopold> I'm thinking more about map gen right now, and analyzing fairness.
2011-02-13T02:40:36  <McLeopold> I'm wondering how to change the algorithm now that we are on a torus
2011-02-13T02:40:41  <pyro-> writing a map generator sounds fun
2011-02-13T02:40:45  <antimatroid> from starting positions? do you want fairness to be the number of squares each ant can get to first, including ties?
2011-02-13T02:40:56  <McLeopold> I don't know yet.
2011-02-13T02:41:02  <antimatroid> and possibly resources
2011-02-13T02:41:05  <antimatroid> that is fairly easy to do
2011-02-13T02:41:29  <McLeopold> voronoi to calc starting territory.
2011-02-13T02:41:37  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-13T02:41:55  <McLeopold> maybe some shortest path to see if they have the same type of starting distance from opponents
2011-02-13T02:41:57  <antimatroid> you do what you did for visibility, but block movement by walls and store more info for each found square, like current distance
2011-02-13T02:42:17  <pyro-> is there a set number of players per game?
2011-02-13T02:42:18  <McLeopold> that's pretty much A*?
2011-02-13T02:42:32  <antimatroid> i'd start them all on a rectangular lattice then add stuff in non-symmetrically from there personally
2011-02-13T02:42:47  <antimatroid> i've never looked at A*
2011-02-13T02:43:03  <antimatroid> pyro-: it will be random and not told to you
2011-02-13T02:43:11  <antimatroid> well, picked from a known possible set
2011-02-13T02:43:14  <antimatroid> but random from that
2011-02-13T02:43:23  <pyro-> oh
2011-02-13T02:43:34  <pyro-> i am also going to write a map generator becuase it sounds awesome
2011-02-13T02:43:39  <antimatroid> please do
2011-02-13T02:43:54  <antimatroid> we want to find whatever maps are most interesting while fair
2011-02-13T02:44:11  <antimatroid> you want every ant to be able to access every non-wall square on the map
2011-02-13T02:44:31  <pyro-> i can already see that making it precisly fair is very complecated
2011-02-13T02:44:32  <antimatroid> don't forget the wrapping when you do that
2011-02-13T02:44:47  <antimatroid> that map gen i linked you yesterday is completely fair
2011-02-13T02:44:58  <antimatroid> yet if you come across an enemy at the start, it wont be on symmetric terms
2011-02-13T02:45:11  <pyro-> and interesting maps** :P
2011-02-13T02:45:20  <McLeopold> antimatroid: a small correction, you want every bot to be able to access the same set of land squares
2011-02-13T02:45:41  <antimatroid> McLeopold: you want people to go around and find closed off regions to fill it with walls?
2011-02-13T02:45:48  <McLeopold> if a map gen creates land that is not accessible, i'm fine with that
2011-02-13T02:45:57  <antimatroid> it wastes space
2011-02-13T02:46:11  <McLeopold> it makes it harder >:)
2011-02-13T02:46:30  <antimatroid> not really, if area enclosed fill with walls
2011-02-13T02:46:52  <McLeopold> if it's not filled with wall, the food gen will place food inside
2011-02-13T02:47:08  <McLeopold> if the walls are thin enough, you can cross the boundary
2011-02-13T02:47:09  <antimatroid> yeah i do kind of like it
2011-02-13T02:47:29  <antimatroid> i prefer walls blocking food spawning
2011-02-13T02:47:44  <antimatroid> actually, no, that's awesome
2011-02-13T02:47:46  <McLeopold> if we do distance 1, it will
2011-02-13T02:47:52  <antimatroid> you will get your own region to yourself
2011-02-13T02:47:58  <antimatroid> i don't think jeff would like that
2011-02-13T02:48:06  <McLeopold> unless someone else get's the other half
2011-02-13T02:48:27  <McLeopold> then there is a separate battle for the region
2011-02-13T02:48:39  <antimatroid> i think the starting accessible region should still be something like at least 80% of land squares
2011-02-13T02:48:44  <McLeopold> maybe then the map is divided such that 2 bots can't kill each other
2011-02-13T02:49:19  <McLeopold> I really just want to crash bots with bad path finding. :)
2011-02-13T02:49:25  <antimatroid> yeah, it'd be fun but have issues
2011-02-13T02:50:17  <McLeopold> it would be a cool strategy, to find the spaces, and attempt to get in
2011-02-13T02:50:32  <pyro-> does the task of map generation include spawning food?
2011-02-13T02:50:54  <McLeopold> you can kinda guarantee survival to the end if you get it
2011-02-13T02:51:07  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-02-13T02:51:10  <McLeopold> it's in the spec
2011-02-13T02:51:19  <McLeopold> the first turn will also spawn food
2011-02-13T02:51:29  <antimatroid> pyro-: you have to place starting food, the engine deals with replenishment
2011-02-13T02:51:43  <McLeopold> I can see having a few starting configurations for food, to ensure more fairness
2011-02-13T02:52:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you can make a blank map, and the engine will place for you
2011-02-13T02:52:35  <McLeopold> I'm thinking that the starting ant will always have 4 food squares in a plus pattern around it
2011-02-13T02:52:48  <McLeopold> so bots can have some type of starting plan
2011-02-13T02:53:06  <McLeopold> the beginning of the game will decide so much, it makes sense
2011-02-13T02:53:11  <antimatroid> why not just start people with a square block or line of ants?
2011-02-13T02:53:26  <McLeopold> that works too
2011-02-13T02:53:38  <antimatroid> otherwise you have to worry about food blocking movement
2011-02-13T02:53:42  <McLeopold> but then with the food, you can see if someone has a better starting schedule
2011-02-13T02:54:09  <antimatroid> there isn't one, do nothing, spawn ants
2011-02-13T02:54:35  <pyro-> when you think about it in 3D space
2011-02-13T02:54:35  <antimatroid> if it's just out of range, walk up one then in a square

2011-02-13T02:54:45  <antimatroid> think about what in 3d space?
2011-02-13T02:54:54  <pyro-> you get a very irregular looking shape from a wraped up rectangle
2011-02-13T02:55:03  <pyro-> i cant fold my piece of paper into anything nice
2011-02-13T02:55:04  <antimatroid> a torus
2011-02-13T02:55:12  <antimatroid> it's a donut
2011-02-13T02:55:17  <pyro-> and have it join at the edges
2011-02-13T02:55:29  <McLeopold> I'm thinking we could have maybe 20 starting configurations, so every bot knows it will have 4 - 8 food squares nearby
2011-02-13T02:55:31  <antimatroid> it's topologically equivalent to a coffee mug
2011-02-13T02:55:35  <McLeopold> the starts will be more even
2011-02-13T02:55:52  <antimatroid> McLeopold: just say you will have 4 resource squares in your field of vision or something?
2011-02-13T02:56:14  <McLeopold> yea
2011-02-13T02:56:15  <antimatroid> i don't like having stuff not randomly generated
2011-02-13T02:56:22  <McLeopold> it will be
2011-02-13T02:56:30  <pyro-> its toroidal but, take the corners of a a4 together and you see its nothing like a donut
2011-02-13T02:56:32  <McLeopold> but the same starting config will be used for each bot
2011-02-13T02:56:49  <antimatroid> pyro-: it is
2011-02-13T02:57:01  <antimatroid> you just can't stretch the paper
2011-02-13T02:57:29  <antimatroid> take a polygonial torus, imagine walking around each iner ring or the ring around the whole thing
2011-02-13T02:57:33  <pyro-> oh i see it
2011-02-13T02:57:34  <McLeopold> fold the paper in half, once vert, once horz, tape the edges
2011-02-13T02:57:35  <antimatroid> that's like walking along your rows and columns

2011-02-13T02:58:12  <antimatroid> that's the first step
2011-02-13T02:58:14  <pyro-> yeah i thought of the cylinder :)
2011-02-13T02:58:14  <McLeopold> you can cross from the outside to the inside
2011-02-13T02:58:16  <antimatroid> then stretch it around
2011-02-13T02:58:18  <pyro-> but streched
2011-02-13T02:58:22  <pyro-> on once side :)
2011-02-13T02:58:25  <pyro-> one
2011-02-13T02:58:31  <McLeopold> just do 2 sides
2011-02-13T02:58:44  <antimatroid> a 3d visualiser with the ability to change the angle would be awesome

2011-02-13T03:00:54  <antimatroid> what do you mean?

2011-02-13T03:07:00  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I think your fog of war is broken
2011-02-13T03:07:11  <antimatroid> at least it is in the gif image on the forums i think
2011-02-13T03:07:15  <pyro-> i think i've possibly worked out a good algorithm for fair map generation. yey. too complicated to be done by tonight tho
2011-02-13T03:07:38  <McLeopold> what do you see?
2011-02-13T03:08:06  <antimatroid> when an ant walks off the bottom to the top near the start, you don't start seeing anything untill it walks over the screen
2011-02-13T03:08:18  <antimatroid> i suspect you're not calculating euclidean distances properly with wrapped edges
2011-02-13T03:08:52  <antimatroid> the spec page has what i'm using
2011-02-13T03:09:41  <McLeopold> dang
2011-02-13T03:09:45  <antimatroid> :P
2011-02-13T03:10:07  <McLeopold> i bet if i used my first method, it would :P
2011-02-13T03:10:21  <antimatroid> yeah but mines faster no? :P
2011-02-13T03:10:32  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-02-13T03:10:55  <antimatroid> another good test on view radius is a.a
2011-02-13T03:11:03  <antimatroid> when i first wrote my algorithm that was broken
2011-02-13T03:11:27  <antimatroid> it would paint around the second a, then not find anything that could move to when i got to it, so it wouldn't reach it's visibility area
2011-02-13T03:11:28  <McLeopold> I know I did have movies where there was wrapping, so I think I just messed up your algo
2011-02-13T03:11:56  <antimatroid> just check your euclidean distance function
2011-02-13T03:12:07  <antimatroid> i have a feeling you just need to change how you get dx and dy
2011-02-13T03:12:43  <McLeopold> yeah, it's naive
2011-02-13T03:12:47  <McLeopold> I'll fix it
2011-02-13T03:13:04  <antimatroid> dx=min(abs(a.x−b.x), width−abs(a.x−b.x))
2011-02-13T03:13:04  <antimatroid> dy=min(abs(a.y−b.y), height−abs(a.y−b.y))
2011-02-13T03:13:47  <antimatroid> i think the starter packages should come with that function and "get location" from a starting location and direction
2011-02-13T03:13:56  <antimatroid> so beginners don't really need to think about the mechanics of wrapping
2011-02-13T03:14:09  <McLeopold> yep, I've got that in my starter package
2011-02-13T03:14:32  <McLeopold> my starter has the distance and a get direction function
2011-02-13T03:14:56  <McLeopold> direction will return the direction of the shortest distance with wrapped edges, so n e s w ne nw se sw
2011-02-13T03:15:15  <antimatroid> say what?>
2011-02-13T03:15:35  <McLeopold> so, you know the shortest distance, but what direction is it?
2011-02-13T03:16:26  <McLeopold> get location is pretty easy, (x + dx) % width
2011-02-13T03:17:58  <antimatroid> my get location uses a constant array to just add stuff depending on the integer direction passed
2011-02-13T03:18:08  <antimatroid> and mods as needed etc.
2011-02-13T03:18:35  <antimatroid> i have enough directions to cover every square in an ants fight radius
2011-02-13T03:19:13  <antimatroid> that way i'm not checking squares for each ant multiple times as to whether i've already looked there

2011-02-13T03:23:51  <McLeopold> it finds a wall and follows it to the left
2011-02-13T03:24:15  <flag> is the protocol decided on at least?
2011-02-13T03:24:25  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-13T03:24:49  <antimatroid> the game is mostly formed, but there are decisions to be made that still make quite a few differences
2011-02-13T03:24:50  <McLeopold> just write 2 functions
2011-02-13T03:24:57  <antimatroid> hence why i would advise against it :P
2011-02-13T03:26:52  <antimatroid> hmmm fuck
2011-02-13T03:27:23  <antimatroid> can we print moves as
2011-02-13T03:27:24  <antimatroid> O source.x source.y dest.x dest.y?
2011-02-13T03:27:46  <antimatroid> i'm going to be looking at my map transposed to what the engine expects back

2011-02-13T03:29:26  <McLeopold> why not a direction?
2011-02-13T03:32:30  <antimatroid> because then i need to work out what the translated direction is
2011-02-13T03:32:35  <antimatroid> rather than print the numbers around the other way
2011-02-13T03:32:45  <antimatroid> transposed*
2011-02-13T03:32:48  <antimatroid> damn i mix that up a lot
2011-02-13T03:33:28  <McLeopold> so, if we go all row/col, you're okay with a direction?
2011-02-13T03:33:32  <antimatroid> yes
2011-02-13T03:33:35  <antimatroid> LO
2011-02-13T03:33:37  <antimatroid> :P*
2011-02-13T03:33:40  <McLeopold> okay
2011-02-13T03:33:49  <McLeopold> change the damn spec
2011-02-13T03:33:54  <antimatroid> you don't need to change it right now :P but yeah
2011-02-13T03:34:15  <antimatroid> you wont even need to think about these things changing ever again once it's all consistent, i promise
2011-02-13T03:34:24  <McLeopold> I know
2011-02-13T03:34:41  <McLeopold> I hope you're writing a c++ engine
2011-02-13T03:34:47  <McLeopold> cause we may need the speed
2011-02-13T03:35:09  <antimatroid> i could, but i never got io working without it being horribly slow
2011-02-13T03:35:12  <McLeopold> you just need to turn it into a python extension :)
2011-02-13T03:35:15  <antimatroid> i'll play around with that tonight if you want?
2011-02-13T03:35:57  <McLeopold> actually, I think someone proposed that the game engine should just be another process that communicates like the bots
2011-02-13T03:36:06  <McLeopold> so, we could write a game in any language
2011-02-13T03:36:40  <antimatroid> will a compiled c++ program run on any machine? or does it need to be compiled locally for different things/
2011-02-13T03:36:46  <antimatroid> i have no idea about that kind of thing
2011-02-13T03:37:24  <flag> depends on the architecture/libraries of the target machine
2011-02-13T03:37:35  <antimatroid> flag: we want it to work on the most possible
2011-02-13T03:37:59  <flag> then it needs to be compiled locally
2011-02-13T03:38:12  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if that's a good idea
2011-02-13T03:38:18  <flag> a linux execuatable won't work on windows, etc.
2011-02-13T03:39:07  <antimatroid> we could give people a python engine then run a c++ on the servers if necessary
2011-02-13T03:39:12  <antimatroid> and have both be open source
2011-02-13T03:40:01  <antimatroid> in fact haven't the previous engines been java that were given to people
2011-02-13T03:40:03  <flag> do you think the game engine will be slow enough to need c++?
2011-02-13T03:40:14  <antimatroid> presumably under the assumption that everyone has jre?
2011-02-13T03:40:22  <flag> yeah, all the previous ones were written in java, which is a decent middle ground
2011-02-13T03:40:25  <antimatroid> i don't think so, we'll see
2011-02-13T03:40:38  * antimatroid has forgotten everything except how awful java was
2011-02-13T03:40:58  <flag> what was wrong with the java engine?
2011-02-13T03:41:50  <antimatroid> no, i mean me and the language
2011-02-13T03:42:04  <antimatroid> i refuse to use java  :P
2011-02-13T03:42:04  <flag> ah
2011-02-13T03:47:48  <antimatroid> McLeopold: specs updated, i changed parameters to rows and cols instead of width and height too
2011-02-13T03:49:08  <McLeopold> yeah, that makes sense

2011-02-13T03:49:18  <McLeopold> s
2011-02-13T03:50:33  <McLeopold> the last contest engine was python, but it didn't need to do much
2011-02-13T03:50:45  <McLeopold> this engine is more complicated, with the fog of war stuff
2011-02-13T03:51:08  <antimatroid> how are we going to piss off the math nerds?
2011-02-13T03:51:12  <McLeopold> I'd rather give every spare cycle to the bots that I can.
2011-02-13T03:51:13  <antimatroid> i am one of the maths nerds:P
2011-02-13T03:51:26  <McLeopold> not using cartesian coordinates
2011-02-13T03:51:45  <antimatroid> lol, they'll prefer [row][col]
2011-02-13T03:51:54  <antimatroid> you treat the map like a matrix
2011-02-13T03:51:58  <McLeopold> except for those that program in D
2011-02-13T03:52:13  <McLeopold> or those that have matrix libraries
2011-02-13T03:52:29  <antimatroid> i'm surprised people don't say in the first week of a cs course, never use [x][y]

2011-02-13T05:10:55  <antimatroid> ant a lives if:
2011-02-13T05:10:55  <antimatroid> enemies(a).size < min_{b \in enemies(a)} (enemies(b).size)
2011-02-13T05:10:55  <antimatroid> or enemies(a).size < enemies(b).size \forall b \in enemies(a)
2011-02-13T05:11:22  <antimatroid> is it reasonably assume a beginner would understand the first?
2011-02-13T05:11:50  <antimatroid> reasonable* damnit!

2011-02-13T18:09:25  <McLeopold> flag: we are still deciding
2011-02-13T18:11:55  <flag> okay, thanks, because I started writing a bot based on the wiki spec and I noticed that the input from the engine was completely different
2011-02-13T18:18:41  <McLeopold> flag: what language?
2011-02-13T18:23:43  <flag> C
2011-02-13T18:25:04  <McLeopold> so, you might start with the map syntax
2011-02-13T18:25:11  <McLeopold> the engine can output both
2011-02-13T18:26:59  <flag> I'm not sure I know what you're saying. I have it configured to accept the map in the form of:
2011-02-13T18:27:19  <flag> M [?.%*?abcABC]
2011-02-13T18:27:57  <flag> and I just realized I'm getting: W 16 17, L 16 19, etc.
2011-02-13T18:27:57  <McLeopold> yeah, go with that
2011-02-13T18:28:10  <McLeopold> do you see the render_text function?
2011-02-13T18:28:54  <flag> in ants.py?
2011-02-13T18:28:58  <amstan_> antimatroid: ^^
2011-02-13T18:29:07  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-13T18:29:14  <McLeopold> there is a function called get_player_state
2011-02-13T18:29:34  <McLeopold> just switch the function in there to use output format you want
2011-02-13T18:30:00  <McLeopold> also, there is a bug in get_vision
2011-02-13T18:30:31  <McLeopold> I'll update in a minute
2011-02-13T18:32:16  <antimatroid> amstan_: ?
2011-02-13T18:32:23  <antimatroid> amstan_: *
2011-02-13T18:32:26  <amstan_> antimatroid: see what flag said
2011-02-13T18:33:08  <flag> does get_vision return the map in the wiki format or a different one?
2011-02-13T18:33:12  <antimatroid> ah, so he can be our designated c writer
2011-02-13T18:33:23  <McLeopold> neither
2011-02-13T18:33:32  <McLeopold> render_text and render_changes
2011-02-13T18:33:39  <McLeopold> changes is what you were seeing
2011-02-13T18:33:44  <McLeopold> text is the map format
2011-02-13T18:33:51  <antimatroid> flag: i'm now confused
2011-02-13T18:34:08  <antimatroid> are you asking about input or visibility counts?
2011-02-13T18:34:22  <antimatroid> (sorry, i literally just woke up :P)
2011-02-13T18:35:20  <flag> well first I was asking whether or not the engine returns the map in the wiki format because it didn't appear to, and now I'm trying to change it
2011-02-13T18:35:52  <antimatroid> are you using mcleopolds engine?
2011-02-13T18:36:00  <antimatroid> input isn't finalised yet i don't think
2011-02-13T18:36:04  <flag> yes
2011-02-13T18:36:49  <antimatroid> i personally expect we'll be using the char maps
2011-02-13T18:37:09  <antimatroid> as we're going to want to send all currently visible squares otherwise which may even be more costly than just char maps
2011-02-13T18:38:16  <McLeopold> they aren't more costly, remember it was a 10x increase for maps
2011-02-13T18:39:27  <flag> if there are two giant armys of ants it might be more costly, no?

2011-02-13T18:43:32  <McLeopold> it's not, I tested
2011-02-13T18:43:40  <McLeopold> maps are way more data
2011-02-13T18:45:42  <antimatroid> is that for printing all currently visible square info or just the old format?
2011-02-13T18:45:51  <flag> maps are more data, but updates are more instrutions
2011-02-13T18:46:24  <McLeopold> we'll get the right mix, just code a map bot for now

2011-02-13T19:04:55  <amstan_> antimatroid: so? lol
2011-02-13T19:05:10  <janzert> McLeopold: from your test before I thought you said the crossover on size was when you could see ~1/8th of the map
2011-02-13T19:05:36  <janzert> or at least had to send changes on 1/8th of the squares
2011-02-13T19:06:07  <janzert> so if you're sending all visible squares not just changes it would then be when seeing 1/8th
2011-02-13T19:07:58  <McLeopold> flag: get_player_start
2011-02-13T19:08:15  <McLeopold> janzert: I need to do more testing
2011-02-13T19:08:38  <McLeopold> I want to run a tcp server, but I am seriously concerned about bandwidth
2011-02-13T19:09:32  <McLeopold> if the average update line is 'W 80 100' then that is 8 characters, when it would only be 1 character in the map format
2011-02-13T19:09:43  <McLeopold> +1 for the new line
2011-02-13T19:09:50  *** SheV0 <SheV0!~chatzilla@97.104.19.221> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2011-02-13T19:09:55  <janzert> It should be about the same as running a tron tcp server was, although I don't know how intensive that was either
2011-02-13T19:10:12  <antimatroid> janzert: most tron maps were 15x15 no?
2011-02-13T19:10:15  <antimatroid> not 200x200+
2011-02-13T19:10:18  <McLeopold> but, if we only send differences, it makes a huge difference, because your sending 100x less information
2011-02-13T19:10:19  <janzert> no
2011-02-13T19:10:28  <antimatroid> 25* maybe?
2011-02-13T19:10:32  <antimatroid> there was something around there
2011-02-13T19:10:47  <janzert> I thought 50x50 was more common on the tcp server
2011-02-13T19:10:47  <antimatroid> although i never used tcp for tron, so they may have been different
2011-02-13T19:11:02  <janzert> I guess I don't remember for sure
2011-02-13T19:11:07  <McLeopold> did tron send the entire map each turn?
2011-02-13T19:11:08  <antimatroid> still a pretty big difference
2011-02-13T19:11:15  <janzert> McLeopold: yes
2011-02-13T19:11:20  <antimatroid> yes, pretty silly in hindsight
2011-02-13T19:11:25  <McLeopold> very
2011-02-13T19:11:45  <janzert> I don't think bandwidth was ever a concern for it :)
2011-02-13T19:11:55  <McLeopold> it is for my conneciton
2011-02-13T19:12:00  <antimatroid> but mcleopold is running his server from home
2011-02-13T19:12:05  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-13T19:12:11  <janzert> yeah, that makes a big difference of course
2011-02-13T19:12:34  <antimatroid> if an official tcp server is done, will that run off an official server?
2011-02-13T19:12:41  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-13T19:12:45  <antimatroid> is it possible to set that up?
2011-02-13T19:12:47  <McLeopold> I may be doing the official one
2011-02-13T19:13:09  <McLeopold> I could get one going in a day, without the ranking
2011-02-13T19:13:18  <McLeopold> if I had a visualizer...
2011-02-13T19:13:29  <antimatroid> we need frontier for that
2011-02-13T19:13:37  <McLeopold> right now I'd have to make the animated gifs
2011-02-13T19:13:51  <McLeopold> actually, I could whip up a pixel one in a day
2011-02-13T19:13:58  <McLeopold> it wouldn't be good
2011-02-13T19:14:01  <janzert> tcp for ants is also going to be more complex since you need to schedule more than 2 players at once
2011-02-13T19:14:15  <McLeopold> yeah, my tcp framework already handles that
2011-02-13T19:14:16  <antimatroid> janzert: pick a map, wait for enough players?
2011-02-13T19:14:44  <McLeopold> I've got it to a working state 2 month ago, it just doesn't look pretty
2011-02-13T19:15:05  <McLeopold> I could never decide if I wanted data to be stored in a database or in text files.
2011-02-13T19:15:41  <janzert> hehe
2011-02-13T19:18:08  <antimatroid> http://xkcd.com/
2011-02-13T19:18:24  <antimatroid> we have a running joke of being the first to pick up on a missed closed bracket with our maths lecturers
2011-02-13T19:19:03  <antimatroid> particularly as they already annoyed the hell out of one of our friends (not I surprisingly)
2011-02-13T19:20:24  <flag> what's the purpose of labeling dead ants on the map?
2011-02-13T19:20:31  <flag> shouldn't they just disappear?
2011-02-13T19:20:57  <janzert> so simple bots can track them easier
2011-02-13T19:21:05  <janzert> rather than just having them disapear
2011-02-13T19:22:00  <flag> how long will a dead ant remain on the map? until the end of the game?
2011-02-13T19:22:05  <janzert> and actually there are situations where otherwise you wouldn't know if an ant died or stepped out of vision
2011-02-13T19:22:20  <janzert> I believe just for the turn following its death
2011-02-13T19:22:49  <flag> ok
2011-02-13T19:27:05  <antimatroid> flag: just the turn after, you can treat it as land if you don't want the information, you also don't see information for one of your dead ants out of range of live ants visibility etc.
2011-02-13T19:36:11  <flag> is my ant always 'a'?
2011-02-13T19:36:29  <antimatroid> yes
2011-02-13T19:36:39  <antimatroid> and the first enemy you always see is b for the rest of the game, etc.
2011-02-13T19:36:54  <flag> okay, thanks
2011-02-13T19:36:58  <antimatroid> np
2011-02-13T19:37:15  <antimatroid> i'm curious, why c over c++?
2011-02-13T19:37:37  <flag> no real reason, personally I just like coding in C
2011-02-13T19:37:51  <antimatroid> as good a reason as any :)
2011-02-13T19:37:58  <flag> :)
2011-02-13T19:47:48  <antimatroid> i love being able to do things like, cin >> state, state++, grid[location], bug << stuff, etc.
2011-02-13T19:48:55  <flag> you can do all those things in C too, except cin and cout which are easily replace by read, write, printf, etc.
2011-02-13T19:49:17  <antimatroid> didn't know that
2011-02-13T19:49:19  <flag> the only thing I'm really missing is something like an std::vector, but it's not that big of a deal
2011-02-13T19:49:23  <antimatroid> i couldn't live without stl either?
2011-02-13T19:49:33  <antimatroid> i use vectors more than i should
2011-02-13T19:50:06  <antimatroid> it's nice being able to create n-dimensional things initialised to 0 or whatever in 1 line though
2011-02-13T19:50:28  <flag> i simply like knowing what's going on behind the scenes
2011-02-13T19:50:53  <antimatroid> i'm not knocking :)
2011-02-13T19:51:01  <antimatroid> i only do that to java
2011-02-13T19:51:05  <flag> haha
2011-02-13T19:52:57  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'm torn, i know the second explanation before for option 1 is simpler for beginners, but the first is nicer
2011-02-13T19:53:25  <antimatroid> flag: on the specs page, which line of latex do you prefer explaining battle resolution option 1?
2011-02-13T19:56:56  <flag> i don't really have a preference
2011-02-13T19:56:59  <antimatroid> I could go all out and define At then At+1 = {a in At | |enemies(a)| < min_{b in enemies(a)} |enemies(b)| }
2011-02-13T19:57:10  <flag> simpler is probably better
2011-02-13T19:57:10  <antimatroid> :*
2011-02-13T19:57:14  <pyro-> antimatroid: use english
2011-02-13T19:57:23  <antimatroid> pyro-: i did, it makes less sense
2011-02-13T19:57:29  <flag> if you can explain it in pure english then you'll scare the least number of people away
2011-02-13T19:57:39  <antimatroid> A given ant a lives if it has less enemies in range than any of those enemies in range have
2011-02-13T19:58:15  <antimatroid> it's a bit of a mouth ful
2011-02-13T19:58:17  <pyro-> antimatroid: its more interesting to specify when an ant doesn't live. i still dont understand your game but i assume ants live by default
2011-02-13T19:58:55  <antimatroid> actually, you might be correct, it means saying at least as many instead of less thatn
2011-02-13T19:59:12  <flag> a given ant A dies if it has more enemies in range than each of its enemies?
2011-02-13T19:59:23  <janzert> an ant dies when it has the same or more enemies in range than its enemies have in range
2011-02-13T19:59:49  <janzert> or than each of its enemies has in range
2011-02-13T20:00:54  <antimatroid> i'm just changing it
2011-02-13T20:00:59  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: this is a spec, not an implementation
2011-02-13T20:01:16  <antimatroid> the second option becomes, there exists b in enemies(a) st enemies(a).size >= enemies(b).size
2011-02-13T20:01:31  <jmcarthur> simplicity is way more important than "elegance"
2011-02-13T20:01:46  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: but but but i'm a maths student :P
2011-02-13T20:01:53  <jmcarthur> i like the exists version
2011-02-13T20:01:53  <antimatroid> i strive for elegance
2011-02-13T20:01:58  <jmcarthur> i think it's elegant
2011-02-13T20:02:20  <jmcarthur> i would change one thing though
2011-02-13T20:02:30  <janzert> I have no idea what that last second option description does ;)
2011-02-13T20:02:37  <jmcarthur> i'd say st enemies(b).size <= enemies(a).size
2011-02-13T20:02:49  <jmcarthur> since we just bound b
2011-02-13T20:03:02  <antimatroid> Janzert: enemies(x) = set of enemies in range of ant x
2011-02-13T20:06:08  <janzert> so.. an ant dies if none of the enemies in range have less enemies in range
2011-02-13T20:08:52  <jmcarthur> no, an ant dies if *any* of them do
2011-02-13T20:09:21  <jmcarthur> and that should be <=, not <
2011-02-13T20:09:30  <jmcarthur> http://mathbin.net/58765
2011-02-13T20:09:40  <jmcarthur> i think i got that roughly right
2011-02-13T20:09:47  <jmcarthur> my latex is a bit rusty
2011-02-13T20:10:53  <antimatroid> i wrote is so people might understand it easier :P
2011-02-13T20:11:01  <jmcarthur> sure
2011-02-13T20:11:07  <antimatroid> it's changed if people want to check
2011-02-13T20:11:34  <jmcarthur> link?
2011-02-13T20:11:53  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-02-13T20:12:00  <antimatroid> ctrl f battle option 1
2011-02-13T20:13:00  <pyro-> wow at this rate im going to find it easier to read the source than your tortured spec :D
2011-02-13T20:13:11  <jmcarthur> "A given ant a dies if it has at least as many enemies in range as at least one of those enemies in range have"  <-- ouch
2011-02-13T20:13:13  <antimatroid> that doesn't make sense?
2011-02-13T20:13:31  <antimatroid> feel free to suggest your own :P
2011-02-13T20:13:34  <janzert> forget about ant a
2011-02-13T20:13:55  <antimatroid> the maths makes it clear
2011-02-13T20:14:02  <janzert> at least until you want to restate it with your math notation
2011-02-13T20:14:16  <janzert> the maths leave it completely unclear to me
2011-02-13T20:14:24  <janzert> at least I can work out the english description
2011-02-13T20:14:51  <jmcarthur> i feel the opposite way
2011-02-13T20:14:58  <jmcarthur> i think the english is way more confusing than the math :P
2011-02-13T20:15:02  <antimatroid> me too, i'll do two paragraphs
2011-02-13T20:15:07  <antimatroid> hold on
2011-02-13T20:15:11  <jmcarthur> this is, IMO, the clearest explanation: http://mathbin.net/58765
2011-02-13T20:15:25  <jmcarthur> i understand that it may just seem overly dense to some, though
2011-02-13T20:16:24  <janzert> An ant dies if it has the same or more enemies in range as any of its enemies has, is correct?
2011-02-13T20:17:01  <jmcarthur> that's kind of an ambiguous way to say it, but i think you have the idea at least
2011-02-13T20:17:37  <jbroman> "If an ant departs Central Station moving north at 35 miles per hour, and another ant departs Boston Harbour moving southwest at 40 miles per hour, will the ants die?"
2011-02-13T20:17:47  <janzert> slightly ambiquous is fine if you're going to have definitive source and a dense math notation explaining it as well :)
2011-02-13T20:18:09  <janzert> at least it gets people headed in the right track before decoding the other notation
2011-02-13T20:18:51  <jmcarthur> An ant alpha dies if and only if there exists some ant beta in the set of the enemies of alpha such that the number of enemies of beta is less than or equal to the number of enemies of alpha.   o_O
2011-02-13T20:19:00  <jmcarthur> i love math notation. says so much in so little space :)
2011-02-13T20:19:50  <antimatroid> yeah, i use it with english all the time, st and wrt especially
2011-02-13T20:19:55  <antimatroid> or there exists
2011-02-13T20:23:11  <antimatroid> try now?
2011-02-13T20:23:27  <antimatroid> i prefer to keep a clear english definition too
2011-02-13T20:23:33  <antimatroid> even if it's slightly more of a mouthful?
2011-02-13T20:23:47  <jmcarthur> i hate such imperative descriptions :\
2011-02-13T20:23:51  <jmcarthur> i find them very confusing
2011-02-13T20:23:57  <jmcarthur> the math notation is nice and declarative
2011-02-13T20:24:52  <antimatroid> yeah, the problem is maths notation is so loaded with with information that a lot of people don't have
2011-02-13T20:24:59  <antimatroid> even worse is actual maths
2011-02-13T20:25:06  <janzert> I'd say replace the "at least on of" with "any of" in the first descriptive sentence
2011-02-13T20:25:20  <antimatroid> yeah, i'll take that
2011-02-13T20:26:34  <janzert> anyway this will give a person reading it a general idea of what is going on and as we've seen to really understand it takes looking at a lot of actual examples
2011-02-13T20:26:55  <janzert> which they'll get by watching games played
2011-02-13T20:27:50  <antimatroid> yeah, i will do some gifs for those battle option parts at some point
2011-02-13T20:27:57  <antimatroid> that way it can be made clear there and then
2011-02-13T20:28:33  <janzert> I wouldn't worry about it too much, most people reading the spec are going to have already watch several games
2011-02-13T20:29:06  <antimatroid> and i have a feeling they will run to the specs (or be pointed there after running to the forums or irc) going wtf
2011-02-13T20:29:21  <janzert> hehe
2011-02-13T20:29:42  <antimatroid> option 2 is even less intuitive though, so it's not like that changes
2011-02-13T20:30:08  <jmcarthur> could be worse
2011-02-13T20:30:43  <jmcarthur> we could have the "enemies" function be a proposition about two ants, giving true when they are enemies and false when they are friendlies
2011-02-13T20:30:53  <jmcarthur> ;)
2011-02-13T20:31:21  <jmcarthur> http://mathbin.net/58765
2011-02-13T20:31:29  <jmcarthur> :\
2011-02-13T20:31:37  <antimatroid> relation? :P
2011-02-13T20:31:44  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-02-13T20:31:46  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-02-13T20:31:57  <jmcarthur> that was terrible of me
2011-02-13T20:32:56  * jmcarthur clutters this up a bit more out of spite
2011-02-13T20:33:03  <antimatroid> i'm doing a physics unit this semester without having done physics in years, that's going to be, interesting to say the least
2011-02-13T20:33:18  <antimatroid> although it's on lie groups so hopefully it's more maths than anything

2011-02-13T21:03:08  <McLeopold> antimatroid:  I would do diagrams for battle resolution.  With simpler english explainations
2011-02-13T21:07:24  <antimatroid> McLeopold: how would you simplify the english explanation any further?
2011-02-13T21:07:38  <antimatroid> i'm looking for the simplest clear explanation
2011-02-13T21:07:56  <McLeopold> for option 1, the one we don't use?
2011-02-13T21:08:11  <McLeopold> Explain the concept of an occupied ant.
2011-02-13T21:08:48  <McLeopold> Then explain an ant can be killed by a less occupied ant.
2011-02-13T21:09:12  <McLeopold> Conceptually, the should be able to see that ants on the edge of a group will probably get a kill.
2011-02-13T21:09:15  <antimatroid> hehe, now we're all at odds, i've found that the most confusing explanation yet :P
2011-02-13T21:09:21  <McLeopold> And ants on the inside won't.
2011-02-13T21:09:44  <antimatroid> ants in the middle might get a kill, they're just more likely to also be killed
2011-02-13T21:09:44  <McLeopold> Keep the math, but save that for later.  Not everyone understands it.
2011-02-13T21:10:03  <McLeopold> They are more likely to not kill someone else.
2011-02-13T21:10:16  <McLeopold> I would focus on who can kill who, not who will die
2011-02-13T21:10:32  <McLeopold> The algo can be different from the explaination.
2011-02-13T21:12:07  <antimatroid> if i say which ant can kill another ant, it might confuse people later with who gets points with kill scoring?
2011-02-13T21:12:30  <antimatroid> otherwise i see how it might be simpler
2011-02-13T21:13:39  <McLeopold> We can give the full math as well.  The "occupied" explaination is just to get them started.
2011-02-13T21:13:58  <McLeopold> It makes the a.b.a case simple to reason about
2011-02-13T21:14:14  <antimatroid> i don't find the occupied idea easier to understand
2011-02-13T21:15:10  <antimatroid> janzert, jmcarthur: opinions?
2011-02-13T21:16:57  <janzert> the short description above, seems like occupied is more confusing, but it might make more sense once expanded. I think what you have now is "good enough" for the time being
2011-02-13T21:17:31  <janzert> as people start stumbling over it you can worry about trying to make it easier to understand
2011-02-13T21:18:09  <janzert> also people who haven't had there head down it for quite a while will probably see easier ways to explain it

2011-02-13T21:38:46  <jmcarthur> i think the "occupied" variation has the most potential, personally
2011-02-13T21:39:01  <jmcarthur> it's the intuition i had when we first came up with the rule
2011-02-13T21:39:12  <antimatroid> what does occupied even mean?
2011-02-13T21:39:45  <jmcarthur> how "busy" an ant is fighting (potentially multiple) other ants
2011-02-13T21:40:00  <jmcarthur> the more busy you are, the more likely you are to die
2011-02-13T21:40:04  <antimatroid> so it's the number of enemies within the battle radius?
2011-02-13T21:40:08  <jmcarthur> depending onhow busy your opponents are
2011-02-13T21:40:11  <jmcarthur> right
2011-02-13T21:40:16  <jmcarthur> it's just a name for that idea
2011-02-13T21:40:46  <antimatroid> it seems like it's just complicating it to me
2011-02-13T21:41:03  <jmcarthur> you are less effective at defending when you're fighting more enemies, but they are less effective at attacking when they are fighting more enemies
2011-02-13T21:41:44  <jmcarthur> that might be a good explanation of the intuition, i think... that last thing i said
2011-02-13T21:42:12  <jmcarthur> it doesn't explain *how* it works at all, but it could put you in the right frame of mind
