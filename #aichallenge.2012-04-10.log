2012-04-10T08:14:55  <Jak_o_Shadows> It's taking them a long time to roll it out.
2012-04-10T08:15:31  <Jak_o_Shadows> I won't get it for another few years.
2012-04-10T08:16:03  <antimatroid> yeah i don't expect it anytime soon
2012-04-10T08:16:09  <antimatroid> Jak_o_Shadows: which state are you in?
2012-04-10T08:16:15  <Jak_o_Shadows> SA
2012-04-10T08:16:19  <antimatroid> tas <3
2012-04-10T08:17:04  <Jak_o_Shadows> It'll be nice when it comes out
2012-04-10T08:17:44  <Jak_o_Shadows> Hopefully more competition and such.
2012-04-10T08:17:46  <antimatroid> if*
2012-04-10T08:17:55  <Jak_o_Shadows> True.
2012-04-10T08:18:22  <Jak_o_Shadows> Wonder what routers and stuff it uses. Hopefully the modem market won't be monopolised by ISP's, as is the case with cable modems.
2012-04-10T08:24:27  <antimatroid> lol, good luck there :P
2012-04-10T08:27:21  <Jak_o_Shadows> well, a new cable modem costs $300.
2012-04-10T08:27:44  <Jak_o_Shadows> an adsl2+ one would cose $200, max, and that would be for a much better brand than netgear
