2010-09-12T00:00:00  <Snowplan> Thanks
2010-09-12T00:00:54  <dstufft> amstan: suhosin isn't right for everything, it disables or modifies some of the more dangerous parts of PHP
2010-09-12T00:01:10  <dstufft> and if your app uses one of them, it won't work obviously

2010-09-12T00:01:18  <a1k0n> Snowplan: if you want to test your bot right now, http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/ is highly recommended
2010-09-12T00:01:28  <a1k0n> JensT1: ahha!  well, this should be a good test of it then!
2010-09-12T00:01:47  <a1k0n> JensT1: planning to write a paper about applying it to this problem?

2010-09-12T00:02:20  <shawnshekari> hello all
2010-09-12T00:02:31  <a1k0n> JensT1: well a blog post about it or something would be awesome later on
2010-09-12T00:02:33  <Snowplan> Thanks, I appreciate it I need to test.

2010-09-12T00:02:39  <JensT1> don't know if I'll have enought time to really do it
2010-09-12T00:02:54  <JensT1> I'm leaving for barcelona in 45mins
2010-09-12T00:03:04  <a1k0n> oh heh!  conference?
2010-09-12T00:03:05  <JensT1> and will only be able to do anything ai related in 2weeks
2010-09-12T00:03:10  <JensT1> holidays with my GF
2010-09-12T00:03:18  <JensT1> :p
2010-09-12T00:03:23  <deepblue> that's more important :)
2010-09-12T00:03:26  <deepblue> even better
2010-09-12T00:03:29  <shawnshekari> Where are your priorities?
2010-09-12T00:03:33  <deepblue> convince your GF to participate too

2010-09-12T00:03:57  <a1k0n> coworker of mine is going
2010-09-12T00:03:57  <JensT1> she's a forensic archaeologists master student
2010-09-12T00:04:11  <deepblue> that won't work I guess ;)
2010-09-12T00:04:27  <Appleman1234> JensT1, you have a few months that is plenty of time
2010-09-12T00:04:44  <Appleman1234> JensT1, enjoy barcelona
2010-09-12T00:04:49  <JensT1> thx :)
2010-09-12T00:05:10  <deepblue> I use vacations to lay in the sun and plan bots
2010-09-12T00:05:19  * Appleman1234 goes back to coverletter writing and sorting clothes whilst thinking about this contest lol
2010-09-12T00:06:13  <amstan> Appleman1234: i know the feeling
2010-09-12T00:06:16  <JensT1> I just thing i'll be hard to find something to predict
2010-09-12T00:06:49  <JensT1> oponnents moves, yeah, but  then you still have to figure out a countermove
2010-09-12T00:07:01  <Appleman1234> amstan, once again I would like to thank you for an awesome contest so far
2010-09-12T00:07:03  <deepblue> countermoves are easy
2010-09-12T00:07:03  <JensT1> will be hard to do it all in 1sec
2010-09-12T00:07:07  <deepblue> predicting is hard
2010-09-12T00:07:16  <amstan> Appleman1234: thank j3camero too
2010-09-12T00:07:39  <madsy> I wonder if the AI challenge can be represented as an LP problem.
2010-09-12T00:07:49  <JensT1> friend of mine just made a bot that beats other bots in 80 moves
2010-09-12T00:08:05  <deepblue> get him on the tcp server
2010-09-12T00:08:05  <Appleman1234> j3camero, thank you very much for being awesome and making an awesome contest, regarding development, I may help out, but not sure if I want to participate or help out yet
2010-09-12T00:08:07  <JensT1> hard to get prediction going there

2010-09-12T00:09:00  <jmcarthur> okay, now that i've actually begun the IO for my starter, i think i made a mistake in the spec
2010-09-12T00:09:04  <jmcarthur> about player numbers
2010-09-12T00:09:15  <Appleman1234> amstan, well which ones I do, whether one or the other or both, I will see
2010-09-12T00:09:24  <jmcarthur> oh, no, nevermind
2010-09-12T00:09:30  <jmcarthur> my confusion was actually planet ids
2010-09-12T00:09:42  <jmcarthur> i was assuming planet 1 always belongs to player 1
2010-09-12T00:09:47  <Appleman1234> amstan, at the moment I am still happy / content about graduating from my undergraduate recently :)
2010-09-12T00:09:55  <jmcarthur> i did not write that in the spec though, so it's okay
2010-09-12T00:09:58  <deepblue> i spend an hour debugging yesterday until I noticed that the maps are mirrored -_-
2010-09-12T00:10:13  <JensT1> yeah, how about that
2010-09-12T00:10:14  <deepblue> thought I had a bug
2010-09-12T00:10:21  <deepblue> duplicating planets
2010-09-12T00:10:25  <JensT1> anyone using the fact that they are mirrored?
2010-09-12T00:10:33  *** JensT1 <JensT1!~jens@91.182.44.101> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2010-09-12T00:10:35  <jmcarthur> probably shouldn't depend on that
2010-09-12T00:10:44  <Appleman1234> JensT1, not yet, but I could use it later
2010-09-12T00:10:58  <greghaynes> Did tcpserver just reset?
2010-09-12T00:11:15  <greghaynes> nvm
2010-09-12T00:12:02  <a1k0n> McLeopold is really milking his one win against deepblue
2010-09-12T00:12:16  <deepblue> yeah
2010-09-12T00:12:19  <drewrobb> yeah
2010-09-12T00:12:22  <deepblue> stupis elo :D
2010-09-12T00:12:42  <drewrobb> what is the Elo initial assumption?
2010-09-12T00:13:03  <a1k0n> as in the prior?
2010-09-12T00:13:15  <drewrobb> yeah
2010-09-12T00:13:15  <a1k0n> probably 0 with a gigantic stddev
2010-09-12T00:13:51  <a1k0n> if all the information you have is one win against the #1 person then you have to assume they might be better
2010-09-12T00:13:53  <jmcarthur> i'm telling you guys... adjusted elo
2010-09-12T00:14:02  <jmcarthur> lower confidence bound
2010-09-12T00:14:04  <jmcarthur> it's delicious
2010-09-12T00:14:26  <a1k0n> yeah except on the main site where you don't get any games played and your rank is totally inaccurate unless you let it sit there for a week
2010-09-12T00:14:54  <j3camero> jmcarthur: we will give it a shot soon, now that we have so many people in the contest. We shall see if it messes up the rankings. If not, I would probably give it a try.

2010-09-12T00:17:41  <a1k0n> i figured branching, reviewing, and then merging was a bit redundant

2010-09-12T00:18:08  <dstufft> nginx + php + php-fpm + apc + suhosin
2010-09-12T00:18:14  <j3camero> amstan: okay cool.
2010-09-12T00:18:22  <amstan> j3camero: check the wiki, add to it
2010-09-12T00:18:25  <dstufft> apc is an opcode cache, prevents you from having to read the php files from disk every pageload
2010-09-12T00:18:55  <j3camero> dstufft: this seems pretty slick.
2010-09-12T00:19:21  <dstufft> j3camero: i can set it up if you want, on port 81 or whatever to test, or whatever you all want to do
2010-09-12T00:19:22  <j3camero> dstufft: how much smaller would you say the memory footprint is?
2010-09-12T00:19:38  <dstufft> http://blog.webfaction.com/a-little-holiday-present
2010-09-12T00:19:40  <dstufft> graphs
2010-09-12T00:19:45  <dstufft> second one in particular
2010-09-12T00:20:07  <dstufft> nginx doesn't really increase in footprint
2010-09-12T00:20:11  <dstufft> it stays constant
2010-09-12T00:20:18  <a1k0n> well, but the php runners will to some extent
2010-09-12T00:20:21  <dstufft> yea
2010-09-12T00:20:22  <dstufft> they will
2010-09-12T00:20:27  <dstufft> php is it's own process with this
2010-09-12T00:20:38  <jmcarthur> but caching is your friend
2010-09-12T00:20:51  <dstufft> but with apache and mod_php (assuming?) every apache process has a copy of the php interpreter
2010-09-12T00:21:13  <a1k0n> though it should be in shared memory so that's not as much of an issue, except for the stuff that's copied on write
2010-09-12T00:21:30  <a1k0n> but yes, apache uses a shitton of ram regardless
2010-09-12T00:21:38  <dstufft> i also have static files being served directly from nginx etc too
2010-09-12T00:21:41  <amstan> dstufft: oh.. how does phpbb handle that setup?
2010-09-12T00:21:58  <dstufft> amstan: i don't have a phpbb install setup atm, but ive used it before with this
2010-09-12T00:22:00  <RobotCaleb> Where to change my password on ai-contest.com?
2010-09-12T00:22:10  <Janzert> I've run phpbb before behind nginx with no problem
2010-09-12T00:22:14  <amstan> RobotCaleb: is it that important?
2010-09-12T00:22:15  <deepblue> drewrobb is giving me some losses
2010-09-12T00:22:50  <drewrobb> yay
2010-09-12T00:23:00  <drewrobb> you were up something like 10-2 against me
2010-09-12T00:23:04  <drewrobb> it is only fair
2010-09-12T00:23:04  <dstufft> if i recall php-fpm also logs pages that load slow
2010-09-12T00:23:07  <greghaynes> amstan: Have youall figured out a plan for getting the contest going again?
2010-09-12T00:23:12  <dstufft> much like mysql slow query log
2010-09-12T00:23:14  <deepblue> hehe
2010-09-12T00:23:20  <deepblue> good games to analyse :)
2010-09-12T00:23:26  <amstan> greghaynes: yep, nxgiwhatever and decentralization

2010-09-12T00:23:49  <amstan> greghaynes: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/Decentralization
2010-09-12T00:23:57  <j3camero> dstufft: i wonder how those results would change for dynamic pages? A lot of our problems are coming from serving people's profile pages, where even caching won't help much.
2010-09-12T00:24:27  <dstufft> j3camero: an opcode cache isn't a cache like that
2010-09-12T00:24:37  <amstan> j3camero: database schema changing may also help
2010-09-12T00:24:37  <j3camero> dstufft: only one way to really find out I guess. Perhaps we could set it up on port 81 on the prod webserver?
2010-09-12T00:24:54  <amstan> dstufft: write me a tutorial, i can set it up
2010-09-12T00:24:59  <dstufft> when you interpret php, it get's compiled down to opcodes
2010-09-12T00:25:12  <dstufft> an opcode cache caches those, sort of like .pyc files
2010-09-12T00:25:18  <j3camero> dstufft: yep
2010-09-12T00:26:02  <j3camero> dstufft: if I get you a shell account and an ordinary user account, would you be able to run a copy of the site off the live database as yourself without needing root? (for now)
2010-09-12T00:26:25  <j3camero> sorry, I just mean an ordinary non-root shell account.
2010-09-12T00:26:44  <j3camero> I guess you would have to use port 8080 or something.
2010-09-12T00:27:23  <dstufft> yea i can do that, a slong as someone is around to aptitude install anything i need
2010-09-12T00:27:32  <j3camero> I am going to turn on the TM and see what happens. amstan: be prepared!
2010-09-12T00:27:40  <j3camero> dstufft: yeah I can help out.
2010-09-12T00:27:44  <amstan> j3camero: for what? there's not much i can do
2010-09-12T00:27:45  <amstan> lol
2010-09-12T00:27:53  <a1k0n> using the new code?

2010-09-12T00:29:11  <a1k0n> dude i have an easy idea: when picking people at random, weight the probability they are picked by the width of the last confidence interval generated by bayeselo (or 1000 if none)
2010-09-12T00:29:12  <j3camero> a1k0n: ah yes sorry. I got sidetracked from the changes I was helping you with when the server started acting up. Sorry about that. Let me know what changes have been made, and what changes you need help making, and then we will restart the TM after making the changes.
2010-09-12T00:29:30  <j3camero> a1k0n: that is a slick idea. Damn.
2010-09-12T00:29:32  <a1k0n> j3camero: no worries, i don't need to do anything to the TM

2010-09-12T00:30:47  <a1k0n> j3camero: i have tested and merged all java viz code with trunk
2010-09-12T00:30:53  <a1k0n> no outstanding issues now
2010-09-12T00:30:53  <j3camero> Okay the rankings should start updating again within ten minutes.
2010-09-12T00:31:06  <a1k0n> the python engine code i haven't touched
2010-09-12T00:31:14  <j3camero> a1k0n: awesome. What about the fixes to the Java engine that I said I would review earlier today?
2010-09-12T00:31:26  <a1k0n> j3camero: i merged them; someone had independently reviewed
2010-09-12T00:31:48  <j3camero> a1k0n: excellent. Sorry again about that. I still actually have the review open and a terminal open where I am testing them. :-)
2010-09-12T00:32:03  <a1k0n> hah, no problem.  i figured you had more important things to worry about
2010-09-12T00:32:20  <a1k0n> plus i had to go take my kid to the park so i figured i'd ask for forgiveness instead of permission
2010-09-12T00:32:22  <j3camero> a1k0n: what's next to fix? Do you think I should focus on putting up more starter packs, or is the python engine more important?
2010-09-12T00:32:34  <j3camero> a1k0n: you made the right call.
2010-09-12T00:32:50  <a1k0n> j3camero: python engine has gotta get into spec
2010-09-12T00:33:08  <j3camero> a1k0n: okay cool. Is that messy half-merged branch still around?
2010-09-12T00:33:09  <a1k0n> but people are hanging out there with starter packs as well, and the TM isn't running that many games yet, so..  i guess it's your call

2010-09-12T00:33:30  <a1k0n> ohh wait
2010-09-12T00:33:36  <a1k0n> yeah, the python code is still half-merged.
2010-09-12T00:33:42  <dstufft> j3camero: check pm's when you get a chance
2010-09-12T00:33:47  <j3camero> a1k0n: no I mean the branch that had java engine fixes and python engine fixes from one or two days ago.
2010-09-12T00:33:51  <a1k0n> j3camero: issue64_69_72_73 python code, yeah
2010-09-12T00:34:00  <a1k0n> that one needs reviewing.
2010-09-12T00:34:28  <Snowplan> Dumb question, Im trying to connect my java bot through the tcp server.  saying execv: ./MyBot: failed. Is there a command line?

2010-09-12T00:46:33  <j3camero> I see the free memory is a lot lower than it was before. It's almost like the TM is using more RAM, and Linux did not decrease the cache size to compensate. Does that sound right?
2010-09-12T00:46:59  <amstan> j3camero: ideally you always have 0 memory available, and cache everything
2010-09-12T00:47:02  <jmcarthur> linux tries to use as much memory as is available for cache
2010-09-12T00:47:19  <amstan> otherwise ram goes to waste..
2010-09-12T00:47:30  <jmcarthur> it starts dropping cache as you get near the swappiness

2010-09-12T01:00:18  <amstan> j3camero: -h also works for ls
2010-09-12T01:00:24  <jmcarthur> you have to look at the compressed sizes
2010-09-12T01:00:34  <amstan> jmcarthur: we have them compressed too i think
2010-09-12T01:00:48  <jmcarthur> chunked up the way they would be sending to sandbox nodes?
2010-09-12T01:01:05  <jmcarthur> presumably it wouldn't just be sending them individually
2010-09-12T01:01:14  <jmcarthur> i guess not a big difference there
2010-09-12T01:01:18  <jmcarthur> n/m me
2010-09-12T01:01:19  <j3camero> As is, I believe the engine sends them to the compute node uncompressed. Unless scp silently compresses things.
2010-09-12T01:01:24  <greghaynes> Are the 'nodes' low or high bandwith / low or high cpu?
2010-09-12T01:01:38  <jmcarthur> scp could silently compress in theory if you configure it to
2010-09-12T01:01:49  <greghaynes> scp does by default IIRc
2010-09-12T01:02:06  <jmcarthur> so then you still have to do the test for compressed

2010-09-12T01:04:47  <jmcarthur> and disqualification from the contest...

2010-09-12T01:14:35  <mistabell> Hey guys... Java noob question that should be easy for someone to answer.  How do you make a list of lists?  Not right -> http://pastebin.com/tctVSUbe
2010-09-12T01:14:36  <amstan> pyside, sucks for now
2010-09-12T01:15:13  <amstan> mistabell: try #java if there's no response here
2010-09-12T01:16:09  <greghaynes> IIRC just use arraylist and its pretty straightforward, the container type is ArrayList< ArrayList< MyClass > >
2010-09-12T01:16:21  <mistabell> Oh, duh.  Thanks greg
2010-09-12T01:16:32  <greghaynes> np

2010-09-12T01:17:42  <j3camero> I put in there a bandwidth estimate for decentralization.

2010-09-12T01:19:03  <amstan> j3camero: i added a list of admins
2010-09-12T01:19:27  <amstan> j3camero: in the exclusion for admins... there's a point which says "or people who are lending server time to the contest."
2010-09-12T01:19:40  <amstan> j3camero: this is exactly the node stuff.. it seems to be a mistake in the wiki then
2010-09-12T01:19:57  <amstan> j3camero: people hosting nodes should be classified as admins and disqualified
2010-09-12T01:21:41  <jmcarthur> j3camero: is there a license on all this source code?
2010-09-12T01:22:45  <j3camero> jmcarthur: apache.
2010-09-12T01:22:56  <j3camero> jmcarthur: closest thing to the WTFPL I could find.

2010-09-12T01:39:33  <tebele> no, locally
2010-09-12T01:39:41  <j3camero> amstan: do a free -m now. Why is there so little cache space all of a sudden?
2010-09-12T01:39:45  <amstan> tebele: i think it's an issue with the visualizer
2010-09-12T01:39:51  <tebele> yes, it is
2010-09-12T01:40:03  <tebele> I've talked with a1k0n before
2010-09-12T01:40:08  <amstan> j3camero: idk, someone cleared the cached stuff, somehow.. lol

2010-09-12T01:44:05  <j3camero> a1k0n: when I look at the diff for engine.py, the only change appears to be taking out the time.sleep(1) statement in the main game loop, and reducing the startup time for players from 3 to 2 seconds. Is that right? Is there no change to the battle resolution stuff?
2010-09-12T01:44:32  <amstan> j3camero: read the backlog pls
2010-09-12T01:44:36  <amstan> j3camero: instructions for stuff

2010-09-12T01:44:47  <jmcarthur> i might need to update the spec if so

2010-09-12T02:20:27  <Baphomet> 2nd one is max turns

2010-09-12T02:21:02  <jmcarthur> maximum time per turn, that is
2010-09-12T02:21:09  <Baphomet> ah ok, thanks
2010-09-12T02:21:13  <jmcarthur> 1000 = 1 second
2010-09-12T02:22:20  <Baphomet> ok any reasons why when i run it at max 200 rounds the program runs heaps slower?

2010-09-12T02:27:39  <ratatata> can this be an engine failure? what are the odds of them both crashing at 1st turn? http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4434927

2010-09-12T02:38:14  <Baphomet> ya its working good right now
2010-09-12T02:38:20  <a1k0n> so um, do you have a cpu time limit on processes in the sandbox or jail or whatever?
2010-09-12T02:38:22  <amstan> stupid java..
2010-09-12T02:38:36  <RobotCaleb> amstan: Yep
2010-09-12T02:38:41  <a1k0n> (ulimit -t)
2010-09-12T02:38:44  <j3camero> a1k0n: no cpu time limit, no. We don't even relaly know how to measure the bots' cpu time.
2010-09-12T02:38:46  <amstan> j3camero: yes.. so what happened there? why did they get that far?
2010-09-12T02:39:07  <a1k0n> j3camero: ulimit -t <nturns*2> ought to be a safe way to do it
2010-09-12T02:39:20  <j3camero> amstan: I dunno. Perhaps the engine or TM died and did not kill the two java bots, so they just kept spinning?
2010-09-12T02:39:43  <Baphomet> why is the round limit on the server so low :( my bot only really gets good late game
2010-09-12T02:39:51  <amstan> j3camero: can you renice the tournament engine?
2010-09-12T02:39:59  <amstan> j3camero: it will make the site go much faster?

2010-09-12T02:40:24  <j3camero> amstan: it's not the TM process itself that's using all the CPU. It's probably the actual bots.

2010-09-12T02:41:02  <j3camero> amstan: yeah
2010-09-12T02:41:02  <jmcarthur> you can start a process with a particular nice level
2010-09-12T02:41:02  <amstan> j3camero: put the nice in there then
2010-09-12T02:41:22  <j3camero> amstan: I dunno. Why do that? CPU isn't much concern is it?
2010-09-12T02:41:38  <jmcarthur> j3camero: nice 19 command
2010-09-12T02:41:40  <amstan> j3camero: it is...
2010-09-12T02:41:49  <amstan> not a lot, but it is
2010-09-12T02:41:52  <jmcarthur> amstan: to be honest i think the main issue is the database
2010-09-12T02:41:57  <j3camero> amstan: if we nice the bots, I am afraid that some bot will get screwed and time out just because someone happened to load a heavy page on the website as it was finishing its turn.
2010-09-12T02:42:03  <jmcarthur> amstan: the TM i think uses a lot of it when it's starting up
2010-09-12T02:42:11  <jmcarthur> amstan: slowing down the TM might actually make it work
2010-09-12T02:42:14  <amstan> jmcarthur: that's why bots should of used cpu time
2010-09-12T02:42:23  <jmcarthur> *make it worse
2010-09-12T02:42:39  <amstan> j3camero: that's why bots should of used cpu time, wasn't this fixed already?
2010-09-12T02:42:47  <j3camero> The TM doesn't appear to be slow as it starts up. I was just running it manually and it seemed fine.
2010-09-12T02:42:54  <sinan> there are 2 games that are marked as losses for me, when i try to view them, there is only 1 turn (and nothing happens). what could it be?
2010-09-12T02:43:05  <amstan> sinan: was it java?
2010-09-12T02:43:10  <dstufft_> i think the main issue is lock contention on the DB, or atleast one of the issues
2010-09-12T02:43:14  <jmcarthur> i'm just saying that if the TM still has a slow query or something then that will just take longer to finish at a lower priority
2010-09-12T02:43:18  <j3camero> sinan: that was a little problem that is fixed now. Don't worry about it.
2010-09-12T02:43:19  <sinan> amstan: no, i'm using python.
2010-09-12T02:43:27  <jmcarthur> if anything you would want the TM to completely *faster*
2010-09-12T02:43:28  <sinan> j3camero: ah ok, thanks :)
2010-09-12T02:43:31  <jmcarthur> *complete
2010-09-12T02:43:42  <amstan> sinan: reupload your code if you want to get rid of the lost game
2010-09-12T02:43:51  <sinan> j3camero: does it mean my AI didn't play in them, or actually lost but i can't view the game?
2010-09-12T02:44:07  <sinan> amstan: cool :) i have a new version coming up soon so i'll do it then
2010-09-12T02:44:09  <amstan> jmcarthur: idk.. site seems a lot more important
2010-09-12T02:44:17  <jmcarthur> amstan: no that's what i'm saying
2010-09-12T02:44:24  <j3camero> sinan: it means either you or your opponent arbitrarily lose the game through no fault of your own. But don't worry, it will even out.
2010-09-12T02:44:35  <jmcarthur> amstan: if the TM has a slow query and is locking the db that could explain the occasional slowdown
2010-09-12T02:44:37  <sinan> j3camero: if that's the case, great ;) thanks
2010-09-12T02:44:44  <jmcarthur> amstan: so speeding up the TM will release those locks faster
2010-09-12T02:45:00  <j3camero> amstan: let's not go nice-ing things. We tried that kind of stuff in the first GAC, and it always had disastrous unintended consequences.
2010-09-12T02:45:11  <amstan> jmcarthur: does renicing the TM actually renice the queries too? i didn't think it was the case
2010-09-12T02:45:23  <jmcarthur> amstan: it means the TM can process them more quickly on its end
2010-09-12T02:45:37  <jmcarthur> most queries are incremental, after all
2010-09-12T02:45:40  <dstufft_> no it doesn't change the queries
2010-09-12T02:45:48  <dstufft_> the queries are done in the DB processes
2010-09-12T02:45:54  <jmcarthur> it changes nothing in the DB
2010-09-12T02:46:06  <dstufft_> SELECTS will be in paralell with other selects
2010-09-12T02:46:20  <dstufft_> but UPDATES are 1 at a time, and the DB is either SELECTing or INSERT/UPDATING
2010-09-12T02:46:36  <dstufft_> so a long running SELECT can get a long queue for updates
2010-09-12T02:46:37  <j3camero> We seem to be golden on memory and apache processes. I wonder how things got so bad earlier in the day. Do you think we might have had a huge traffic spike all at once or something? Like maybe a famous person put a link to the leaderboard in a twitter post or some shit?
2010-09-12T02:46:43  <jmcarthur> somebody said earlier that the TM locks a lot of stuff in the db
2010-09-12T02:46:43  <amstan> j3camero: so.. how is the time done now? cpu time or wall time?
2010-09-12T02:47:03  <jmcarthur> still wall time i'm sure
2010-09-12T02:47:06  <j3camero> wall time
2010-09-12T02:47:09  <amstan> j3camero: before it was bad becasue we had that limit set too low, it wasn't the ram
2010-09-12T02:47:15  <amstan> j3camero: can we fix it? change to cpu time?
2010-09-12T02:47:26  <j3camero> There has been a conversation about cpu time. We just need to think it through very carefully. It's not as simple as it seems at first.
2010-09-12T02:47:41  <jmcarthur> indeed it's not :(
2010-09-12T02:48:04  <a1k0n> if i submit a while(1); bot, will it get killed after it times out?
2010-09-12T02:48:05  <amstan> j3camero: i'm just saying.. wall time is the most unfair thing ever, especially since you have http and mysql on the same box
2010-09-12T02:48:10  <amstan> jmcarthur: on a singlecore cpu..
2010-09-12T02:48:16  <amstan> j3camero: ^
2010-09-12T02:48:23  <jmcarthur> i agree. wall time *killed* my bot in the last contest
2010-09-12T02:48:30  <j3camero> It's appealing to "just switch to cpu time to make things fairer" but there are some bad things that can happen. What if somebody submit this bot? while(1) {sleep(999);}
2010-09-12T02:48:38  <amstan> jmcarthur: sorry for highlighting you too, too many ppl here, my autocomplete limit is set too low
2010-09-12T02:48:41  <jmcarthur> j3camero: that won't hurt anything
2010-09-12T02:48:44  <a1k0n> and mine.  many of my games had errors that were only made if it could only search for like 100ms
2010-09-12T02:48:46  <jmcarthur> j3camero: it's not *doing* anything
2010-09-12T02:49:01  <amstan> j3camero: use both then, 10 seconds wall, 1 second cpu
2010-09-12T02:49:09  <jmcarthur> j3camero: plus, the ideal solution would do 1 cpu .... yeah that
2010-09-12T02:49:29  <jmcarthur> 10 wall results in DQ, 1 cpu results in losing the match
2010-09-12T02:49:52  <amstan> j3camero: but i agree, sleep(999) does not actually use up the cpu, it just waits forever
2010-09-12T02:49:53  <a1k0n> well, the server load could be at 200 and it takes 10 wall clock seconds to run 1 cpu second easily
2010-09-12T02:50:05  <j3camero> amstan: that's one possible solution, but then somebody could submit a bot that waits for 10 seconds every turn, just to slow down out games/minute rate, which then fucks the leaderboard.
2010-09-12T02:50:36  <jmcarthur> j3camero: you're being a bit paranoid
2010-09-12T02:50:40  <dstufft_> i really really hate dependencies
2010-09-12T02:50:42  <jmcarthur> if somebody wants to fuck things up they can anyway
2010-09-12T02:50:46  <amstan> j3camero: once you have cpu time setup, you can run like 20 games concurrently, since cpu time will be accurate in giving everyone good cpu usage
2010-09-12T02:50:47  <j3camero> The reason for the time limit is to guarantee a minimum throughput on the games, not to be fair to the cotnestants.
2010-09-12T02:50:49  <jmcarthur> and we can attack that on a case by case basis
2010-09-12T02:51:01  <jmcarthur> the point is that the wall time is *unfair* to contestants
2010-09-12T02:51:09  <jmcarthur> rather than neutral
2010-09-12T02:51:21  <amstan> i'm with jmcarthur
2010-09-12T02:51:36  <amstan> right now it is unfair, someone loads a page, a bot gets less time
2010-09-12T02:52:16  <j3camero> The interim rankings don't really matter though. They're just to get an idea how you're doing.
2010-09-12T02:52:33  <jmcarthur> did you switch to cpu time for the final tournament last time?
2010-09-12T02:52:37  <amstan> j3camero: it'll be the same problem in the final tournament
2010-09-12T02:52:37  <j3camero> During the final tournament, we turn off the leaderboard, traffic drops for a few days, and we can run a fair tournament.

2010-09-12T02:53:08  <jmcarthur> even with only two bots on the machine at once and that's it it's not fair

2010-09-12T02:53:22  <dstufft_> j3camero: apt-get install libevent and see if that get's the newer version of libevent (when you got a sec)
2010-09-12T02:53:45  <amstan> dstufft_: i can do it
2010-09-12T02:53:48  <amstan> dstufft_: but why install?
2010-09-12T02:54:39  <dstufft_> amstan: if i recall the version of libevent in the mainline repo is named libevent1 or something along that lines
2010-09-12T02:54:40  <jmcarthur> personally, i think game throughput is less important than game fairness, even when just testing. hard to test when you don't even know if your bot gets 0.95 seconds or 0.05 seconds
2010-09-12T02:55:19  <amstan> jmcarthur: are you getting all this?

2010-09-12T03:00:23  <Janzert> does new include a new pairing algorithm other than random yet?
2010-09-12T03:00:33  <Palmik> I think i found the reason why I sometimes send invalid orders even if they should be valid... it's probably because in one turn, I am sending more then once from the same planet and the data structure is not updating... happy to figure it out, unhappy that I have to rewrite quite a lot of things :P
2010-09-12T03:01:18  <Palmik> What is the new turnament manager?
2010-09-12T03:01:59  <dolphin278> Palmik: you should check total amount of ships sent from single planet.
2010-09-12T03:02:21  <kirkeby> j3camero: You could parse /proc/<pid>/stat for each of the bots regularly, it has a field for how much user-mode time a process has had.
2010-09-12T03:02:22  <a1k0n> i thought it was the one in the patch which matched people up preferentially against people with similar elo ratings
2010-09-12T03:02:37  <j3camero> kirkeby: yeah that's what I was thinking.
2010-09-12T03:03:26  <Palmik> dolphin278, I of course, do that... the thing is, that after you issue order, your planets are not updated (the numShips is not lowered), so when I send again from that planet, I got invalid data
2010-09-12T03:03:37  <j3camero> a1k0n Janzert: I haven't had a chance to switch to a decent pairing algorithm yet. Was supposed to do this today, but the server meltdown took up all the time. Hopefully this will happen tomorrow. For now, the rankings just converge really slowly.
2010-09-12T03:03:50  <Palmik> it should be easy to fix that though

2010-09-12T03:45:12  <zaphus> right now the odds of you being picked for a match are over 300-1  (2 players out of 600 for each match) - so it could obviously be a while before you play :-)  the scheduler will be changing soon to help with that
2010-09-12T03:45:34  <a1k0n> there's a match every five seconds or so tho

2010-09-12T03:46:03  <zaphus> a1k0n so with luck you'd get a game every 25 minutes (5 seconds * 300 games)
2010-09-12T03:46:27  <dstufft_> i think it's completly random
2010-09-12T03:46:31  <dstufft_> so
2010-09-12T03:46:37  <dstufft_> highly unlikely to get 1 every 25min

2010-09-12T03:54:43  <Palmik> yeah, and then just sort them... or if you want just the closest, sorting is a bit overkill
2010-09-12T03:55:33  <rwa> if you wanted to do it yourself, dist = sqrt(dx^2 +dy^2)

2010-09-12T04:14:28  <Baphomet> blarg everyone tries to help me and i still dunno how to do anything
2010-09-12T04:15:36  <Baphomet> if there is pw.NotMyPlanets() and pw.MyPlanets() is there just a pw.planets()?
2010-09-12T04:16:03  <ratatata> they all exist as well as pw.EnemyPlanets()
2010-09-12T04:17:39  <Palmik> Can I send ships so that the planet is left with 0 ships or is that illegal?
2010-09-12T04:17:50  <dhartmei> that's fine
2010-09-12T04:17:56  <greghaynes> What is the algo for determining the growth rate on a planet? growth rate * num_ships?
2010-09-12T04:18:13  <dhartmei> no, constant, not dependant on number of ships

2010-09-12T04:30:19  <ratatata> zaphus: I asked about that couple hours ago.. specifically about the 1st match example.. I believe it was j3camero saying that he fixed the cause of that
2010-09-12T04:30:46  <ratatata> so yes, there was a bug and hotfixed me thinks
2010-09-12T04:30:54  <zaphus> ratatata:  ah, I wasnt here for that - was teaching my boy to ride without training wheels :-)

2010-09-12T04:55:26  <Baphomet> how does one use that/another function to identify/compare the players production?
2010-09-12T04:58:11  <RobinB> i guess it sums the production of the posessed planets
2010-09-12T04:58:36  <Baphomet> ya, and you would think (pw.Production(1) is player 1 etc, but it doesnt work for some reason

2010-09-12T05:38:55  <bss03> jaspervdj: I'm about to send a couple of pull requests.  Both merge cleanly with your master on GitHub.
2010-09-12T05:39:14  <jaspervdj> cool, fire :-)
2010-09-12T05:39:23  <bss03> jaspervdj: And, I think after merging those, our package will be in as good shape as the Python package.
2010-09-12T05:39:34  <jaspervdj> \o/
2010-09-12T05:39:40  <bss03> jaspervdj: So, I was wondering if there's a way to make it "official" some how.
2010-09-12T05:40:04  <jaspervdj> just zip it up with the maps and the java stuff and ping the organizers will do :-)
2010-09-12T05:40:33  <shawnshekari> Does anyone know how frequently we should see our bot matched up?
2010-09-12T05:41:54  <bss03> shawnshekari: Last I heard, they were still doing random pairings.
2010-09-12T05:42:20  <bss03> shawnshekari: So, it could be fast or slow, depending on your luck with random number generators.
2010-09-12T05:42:30  <jaspervdj> bss03: I'm afk, go ahead and send me the pull requests, I'll merge them later this afternoon
2010-09-12T05:42:48  <bss03> jaspervdj: One already your way; the other coming soon.
2010-09-12T05:43:24  <shawnshekari> ok, thanks.
2010-09-12T05:43:52  <bss03> @later tell jaspervdj I'll let you decide when the stuff is ready to be submitted to the organizers.  Let me know if there's something else that needs work.
2010-09-12T05:43:52  <contestbot> bss03: The operation succeeded.
2010-09-12T05:43:57  <Baphomet> *cries* i cant code for shit
2010-09-12T05:44:30  <amstan> Baphomet: perhaps you should start with something easier
2010-09-12T05:44:50  <bss03> Baphomet: Blah, it just takes practice, like many things.
2010-09-12T05:45:18  <Baphomet> i have some basic c++ skils but nothing seems to be working for me
2010-09-12T05:45:33  <bss03> Baphomet: Your first language is the hardest; I find it's now relatively easy for me to pick up another.
2010-09-12T05:46:04  <bss03> Baphomet: Compiler errors, run-time crashes, or just trouble putting your strategy in code.
2010-09-12T05:46:30  <bss03> Baphomet: I can help with the first, and *maybe* the second, the last is tricky.

2010-09-12T06:10:49  <mistabell> ah that is strange.  I've only played with the Java one.  Python guys?
2010-09-12T06:11:06  <Palmik> Oh my... my new bot gets it's ass handed by my older one :'(
2010-09-12T06:11:27  <elijahbal> mistabell: It's not a matter of python.

2010-09-12T06:12:04  <bss03> elijahbal: If a bot times bot, PlayGame.jar removes it from the game.

2010-09-12T06:13:13  <bss03> elijahbal: It looks like you are calling PlayGame.jar correctly though.  Those java bots must be crashing or otherwise failing somehow.
2010-09-12T06:13:46  <elijahbal> Well, it doesn't take one minute to say me Â« time out Â»
2010-09-12T06:14:00  <elijahbal> it's strange also.
2010-09-12T06:14:10  <elijahbal> because the time out is one minute afaik
2010-09-12T06:14:13  <bss03> elijahbal: What happens if you do ({ cat maps/map1.txt; echo go; } | java -jar example_bots/BullyBot.jar)?

2010-09-12T06:23:38  <mistabell> so, first it sends an amount to get it to 0, then sends an amount based on the growthrate?  or something.

2010-09-12T06:39:36  <elijahbal> Hey, let me recap just for see if I'm ok with the internal working of the context.
2010-09-12T06:39:42  <elijahbal> All the game is text-file based ?
2010-09-12T06:40:02  <bss03> With me as like the 2nd best ranked Haskeller, that's kinda sad.  I just picked up Haskell like... this(?) January.
2010-09-12T06:40:24  <elijahbal> And you can rewrite your Galaxy class ?
2010-09-12T06:41:05  <mistabell> sounds about right.  haha.
2010-09-12T06:41:12  <bss03> elijahbal: You can sumbit anything that the official server will compile.  You can start from scratch if you want.  I.e. Yes, you can modify any calss.
2010-09-12T06:41:33  <elijahbal> yes, but eg what the lib available for python ?
2010-09-12T06:41:36  <elijahbal> Is it just std lib ?
2010-09-12T06:41:54  <mistabell> kudos to the guys organizing this contest.  everything has been super smooth for me
2010-09-12T06:42:05  <elijahbal> Will the server advertise you if you give a bad file ?
2010-09-12T06:42:22  <bss03> elijahbal: It's not strictly file-based though.  The stuff coming from the server to your program is likely via UNIX pipe, but your program just needs to read stdin and write stdout.
2010-09-12T06:42:23  <mistabell> yeah, it'll bounce back

2010-09-12T06:44:59  <Palmik> Hmm... rating does not reset by uploading new version?
2010-09-12T06:45:18  <mistabell> rating does reset
2010-09-12T06:45:28  <mistabell> takes a few minutes
2010-09-12T06:45:37  <Palmik> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=3891 this is weird
2010-09-12T06:45:48  <bss03> elijahbal: It still hasn't made it into an Ubuntu LTS, but there is an "official" set for libraries to go with GHC--called the Haskell Platform--which would make my life easier, but we don't get it on the official server. :(
2010-09-12T06:45:57  <Palmik> it seems that from last upload he had played only 2 games, one of which he lost nad is ranked 27th
2010-09-12T06:46:07  <Palmik> *and
2010-09-12T06:46:21  <mistabell> Palmik: it's part of the scoring, it's weird like that
2010-09-12T06:46:25  <bss03> That ranking is probably only based on the first game.

2010-09-12T06:46:42  <Palmik> but still, he only beat someone ranked 127
2010-09-12T06:46:43  <bss03> The ranking update as a separate process from the games being played.
2010-09-12T06:47:12  <mistabell> also, can't your score go up if you lose to someone with a high score?
2010-09-12T06:47:18  <mistabell> and go down if you beat someone with a low score?
2010-09-12T06:47:26  <bss03> The current ranking system is very... generous if you have a W/L record of 100%.
2010-09-12T06:47:49  <bss03> Yes, your ranking can change if you don't even play a game.
2010-09-12T06:48:44  <bss03> Cause it's a ranking.  If someone's BayesianElo goes above yours, your rank increases since they jump from below you to above you.
2010-09-12T06:49:08  <elijahbal> What will happen if you got a timeout ?
2010-09-12T06:49:29  <elijahbal> Do you lose immediatly ?
2010-09-12T06:49:39  <s_denchev> yes
2010-09-12T06:49:41  <bss03> elijahbal: The official server is like PlayGame.jar there.  It removes you from the game.
2010-09-12T06:49:53  <elijahbal> But can you play another match ?
2010-09-12T06:50:08  <bss03> elijahbal: Unless the opponent times out at the same time you'll get a loss.
2010-09-12T06:50:19  <elijahbal> k
2010-09-12T06:50:36  <bss03> elijahbal: I believe you will still get scheduled for future games.
2010-09-12T06:50:52  <elijahbal> k
2010-09-12T06:51:31  <bss03> elijahbal: There are certain conditions when a bot might stop getting scheduled at all, but that's only if the engine thinks you violated (or tried to violate) the sandbox.
2010-09-12T06:51:33  <elijahbal> Cannot write a bot in C, huh ?
2010-09-12T06:51:48  <elijahbal> In C++ a bot should be very fast.
2010-09-12T06:51:49  <bss03> elijahbal: I bet you can.
2010-09-12T06:51:55  <elijahbal> What do you think ?

2010-09-12T06:52:14  <bss03> elijahbal: But, there's no starter package for C, ATM.
2010-09-12T06:52:29  <elijahbal> bss03: nope, but there is one for C++
2010-09-12T06:52:39  <elijahbal> that's not bad if you want speed.
2010-09-12T06:52:42  <bss03> elijahbal: I'm not sure; my bot plays exteremely fast and is written in Haskell.
2010-09-12T06:52:53  <elijahbal> Haskell is a compiled language ?
2010-09-12T06:53:16  <bss03> Yes-ish.
2010-09-12T06:53:21  <bartwe> woot, my first win against hsBot10.01 ha, i guess that means i beat a haskell ot ?
2010-09-12T06:53:44  <bss03> There's no "eval" or something like that, so you can definitely compile it without the binary containing a Haskell runtime.
2010-09-12T06:54:23  <bss03> And it is commonly compiled.

2010-09-12T06:54:49  <bss03> However, GHC also ships with an interactive evaluator that uses most of the same internals.
2010-09-12T06:55:02  <elijahbal> omg I just got an strategy idea
2010-09-12T06:55:28  <bss03> Haskell does not do incredible at the langauge shoot-out when it come to speed, but ti's not horrible either.
2010-09-12T06:55:57  <kay> It's my understanding that compiled haskell runs only slightly slower than C
2010-09-12T06:56:29  <bss03> I think the main advantage to Haskell is the static typing, which make for fewer run-time errors.  But, I've also used it's non-strict nature quite a lot in this compeition.

2010-09-12T07:00:30  <kay> Heh
2010-09-12T07:00:46  <Palmik> weird that the haskell source code is often longer that the C one
2010-09-12T07:01:13  <bss03> Palmik: When I read one of the Haskell programs it wasn't very idiomatic Haskell.
2010-09-12T07:01:56  <bss03> Plamik: So instead of doing things the "Haskell way" they just found a Haskell function (sometimes from the FFI) that behaved exactly like the C function and used it.
2010-09-12T07:02:12  <bss03> But, that could have changed.
2010-09-12T07:02:39  <bss03> Plus, sometimes that really is the fastest way to write stuff.  However, like many high-level languages,...

2010-09-12T07:05:36  <bss03> 6.12 is supposed to be faster than 6.8
2010-09-12T07:05:57  <Palmik> I hope that the final turnament will not be ranked based on rating but rather some "everyone against everyone" or something

2010-09-12T07:06:50  <Zeiris> Galcon is a terrible game with a terrible UI and terrible balance :(
2010-09-12T07:06:51  <mistabell> ah, that's true.  I hadn't thought about that
2010-09-12T07:06:56  <Zeiris> I just blew at least 30 minutes on it.
2010-09-12T07:07:22  <bss03> Palmik: No it'll be based on rating, but there may be some tweaks in scheduling, ratings calculation, and rate of play.
2010-09-12T07:07:26  <iFire> Zeiris actually the developer said the high level ai cheats
2010-09-12T07:07:31  <iFire> by getting more ships
2010-09-12T07:07:44  <iFire> galcon is the galcon ai in the ranking
2010-09-12T07:07:47  <Zeiris> The maps seem balanced in its favor, too.
2010-09-12T07:08:05  <Palmik> Zeiris, just random the ap until it's in your favor
2010-09-12T07:08:11  <Zeiris> Heh.
2010-09-12T07:08:31  <iFire> bss03 is there a plan for 7.0
2010-09-12T07:08:37  <Palmik> But the AI is cheating in the highest levels... it took me like 30 tries to beat the last one
2010-09-12T07:08:47  <iFire> I looked around the wiki and the llvm stuff there is from months ago
2010-09-12T07:08:59  <Palmik> bss03, hmm
2010-09-12T07:09:04  <bss03> iFire: Yeah, what was going to be 6.14 is now 7.0, I think.
2010-09-12T07:09:32  <iFire> bss03 any idea what's the best too for programically generating wrappings from c++ to haskell?
2010-09-12T07:09:40  <bss03> iFire: They was to releace in time of the ICFP this year, I think.  The GHC devs say that a lot though.

2010-09-12T07:11:41  <mistabell> but all of the API stuff
2010-09-12T07:11:45  <Zeiris> I'm not sure whether it's map layout or cheaty AI, but the bots seem to capture way more planets than actual galcon game does.
2010-09-12T07:12:02  <Palmik> I think they just start with more ships
2010-09-12T07:12:05  <bss03> iFire: I heard.  But, no, I don't want to write to the iPhone.  I have an HTC Hero, and will probably continue to use Android in the future.
2010-09-12T07:12:05  <bartwe> compiling on their server i can unerstand, but still, it forces weird versions of compilers and such
2010-09-12T07:12:14  <Palmik> as in low levels they start with more ships

2010-09-12T07:23:25  <javagamer_Cpp> bss03, I can see why you know a lot more about compiler errors then
2010-09-12T07:23:39  <bss03> I think the problem is that ShowCloest() is const, so you can't modify member variable in it (they are "const"-ified).
2010-09-12T07:24:45  <bss03> You can probably drop the "const" from ShowClosest(), but that might cascade your error.  You could make the member you are touching "mutable".

2010-09-12T07:35:00  <bss03> javagamer_Cpp: I don't want to move.  But, if you have a job I can do from home, I'm cheap.  (Living expenses aren't that high here.)

2010-09-12T07:35:47  <Obeleh> Is it possible that by winning a match I can drop more than 50 spots on the ranking board?
2010-09-12T07:35:47  <bss03> javagamer_Cpp: I'll even do some travel, I just don't want to be away from home all the time.
2010-09-12T07:36:13  <mistabell> Obeleh: overall, after you play a few games the rating seems fair.  it's just weird for the first few
2010-09-12T07:36:15  <bss03> Obeleh: Unfortunately, yes.  For two reasons:
2010-09-12T07:36:26  <bartwe> Obeleh: it can if someone you lost against also loses some games
2010-09-12T07:36:40  <Obeleh> k
2010-09-12T07:36:58  <mistabell> you can submit a new bot and climb up to a higher spot than you were before in the same day if your code's better than the last one
2010-09-12T07:37:00  <bss03> Obeleh: More matches means tighter Bayesian bounds on your Elo, and the current rating system is a git generous.
2010-09-12T07:37:51  <bss03> Obeleh: Second, if others increase their rating, your RANKing might fall because they passed you -- which might happen even if you don't play a game.

2010-09-12T07:38:44  <Naktibalda> oh, nice, I won my first game over tcp
2010-09-12T07:38:52  <javagamer_Cpp> Thanks bss03 and Palmik, got it working w/ the find method
2010-09-12T07:39:06  <Obeleh> Another question. the previous bot I've uploaded ended up playing against only 4 better bots. The rest like 12 were all little competition. Shouldnt bots match more against other bots that are more equally matched?
2010-09-12T07:39:17  <bss03> javagamer_Cpp: Sweet!
2010-09-12T07:39:42  <bss03> Obeleh: That's definitely in the works.  The current game scheduler is extremely simple.
2010-09-12T07:39:46  <Palmik> Obeleh, it's random now
2010-09-12T07:39:49  <bss03> Obeleh: Random pairings. :(
2010-09-12T07:40:02  <Obeleh> Ok thanks for the answers guys :)
2010-09-12T07:40:12  <mistabell> ah, I was thinking it paired you with those who hadn't had many games
2010-09-12T07:40:21  <mistabell> but I guess all the new signups and the random function end up doing that
2010-09-12T07:40:34  <Obeleh> I dont know if any of the organizers are reading but... They're doing a nice job !!! :)
2010-09-12T07:41:17  <Obeleh> Really I like building newer better versions and see it compete :D
2010-09-12T07:41:27  <Baphomet> is there any chance of the offical round length being increased?
2010-09-12T07:41:33  <Baphomet> 200 seems pretty low to me
2010-09-12T07:41:49  <Baphomet> my bot looses many tims due to the short round length
2010-09-12T07:41:51  <bss03> Baphomet: My bot rarely goes to 200.
2010-09-12T07:42:07  <bss03> Baphomet: It either wins or loses by about 150.
2010-09-12T07:42:08  <Obeleh> I havent had a match yet where the match wasn't decided in 200 rounds
2010-09-12T07:42:09  <Baphomet> well it always depends on the style of the bot
2010-09-12T07:42:23  <mistabell> a bot that loses in 200 tends to lose in 400 turns against better bots
2010-09-12T07:42:28  <Baphomet> all the top ones use that rapid spreading method
2010-09-12T07:42:33  <Obeleh> And when it goes to 200 you can see one or the other side being the stronger one
2010-09-12T07:42:51  <bss03> Baphomet: I have seen matches between two simple-ish bots that I actually thought were decided the wrong way since it was called at 200 turns.

2010-09-12T07:43:12  <mistabell> 200 seems low until you really start optimizing
2010-09-12T07:43:21  <Obeleh> I agree
2010-09-12T07:43:34  <Naktibalda> lol, my opponent sent a streem of 1 ship fleets, and it couldn't capture a planet with 0 ships
2010-09-12T07:43:35  <Baphomet> currently the rules just force everyone to use a similar method or loose
2010-09-12T07:43:42  <bss03> Baphomet: But, incresing the game length means throwing more CPU at each game... which might be a problem right now.
2010-09-12T07:44:31  <bss03> Baphomet: But, asking about it on the Forums shouldn't hurt.
2010-09-12T07:44:44  <mistabell> 4:40am, time to stop playing with bots.  lol.  Have a great night /day you guys.  Awesome competition.

2010-09-12T07:46:28  <Baphomet> well maybe i just suck at programming
2010-09-12T07:46:42  <Obeleh> You also need strategy
2010-09-12T07:46:49  <Obeleh> So blame that ;)
2010-09-12T07:47:03  <bss03> Baphomet: I doubt it.  But, "wait" is rarely a good strategy.
2010-09-12T07:47:04  <Obeleh> You could be a perfect programmer still :P
2010-09-12T07:47:06  <Baphomet> i have strategy, i just dont know how to program
2010-09-12T07:47:33  <Baphomet> i have multiple tactics i want to implement i just dont know how
2010-09-12T07:47:38  <Obeleh> if you need some help just ask
2010-09-12T07:47:38  <bss03> Baphomet: Also, keep in mind that you can all IssueOrder mutltiple times in DoTurn, if needed.
2010-09-12T07:47:57  <Baphomet> ah intresting, i didnt know that
2010-09-12T07:47:57  <bss03> Baphomet: If you watch one of my games, you'll see me sending crap everywhere!
2010-09-12T07:48:09  <Baphomet> i always wondered how people did that
2010-09-12T07:48:50  <Palmik> but beware if you send more then once from the same planet, you will have to modify the issueOrder method to update the ships count on the planet
2010-09-12T07:48:52  <bss03> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4442686 -- is a come-from-behind win, and I have a LOT of fleets in the air at one point.
2010-09-12T07:49:18  <bss03> Palmik: I wouldn't modify IssueOrder to do that.
2010-09-12T07:49:28  <Palmik> I would, because it's rational :)
2010-09-12T07:49:39  <bss03> Palmik: I would update the bookkeeping, just not in IssueOrder.
2010-09-12T07:49:45  <Palmik> It has no place in your "logic" code

2010-09-12T07:51:37  <bss03> Palmik: In some ways I agree with you, but I still wouldn't put it in IssueOrder.
2010-09-12T07:51:50  <Palmik> if you are working with the starter package, you have to update planets which are in planets_ vector which is private, so you have to do it in some PlanetWars method unless you are upto major rewrite :)

2010-09-12T07:56:10  <javagamer_Cpp> I've been meaning to learn Haskell, does it really make you a better programmer like some claim?
2010-09-12T07:56:40  <antimatroid> Appleman1234: it's not very good yet though, I got pantsed by any of the better bots and I don't think they've done much yet either
2010-09-12T07:56:47  <bss03> Palmik: Plus, I wouldn't be writing in Haskell if such things were really an issue.

2010-09-12T08:01:40  <antimatroid> allthough the bot I ran some games with before was literally just using some of my information to add possible moves to a priority queue and pick the best while the move is still fesible

2010-09-12T08:02:15  <antimatroid> it's not, but I expect it to be
2010-09-12T08:02:28  <bss03> It's hard to describe exactly what I'm talking about... but occationally, I'll have an "epiphany" in Haskell. ...
2010-09-12T08:03:09  <bss03> Suddenly, my brain will start using (or at least "reaching for") some of the Haskell tools automatically. ...
2010-09-12T08:04:34  <bss03> That's usually when I realize (a) "Oh, I finally get that!" and (b) "Wow, this would be a lot longer in C++ / Java."
2010-09-12T08:04:49  <javagamer_Cpp> but that doesn't really change how you look at other languages?
2010-09-12T08:04:59  <bss03> Still, no langauge can save a bad programmer from themselves.
2010-09-12T08:05:25  <bss03> Oh, it definitely changes how you look at new lanaguages, and it will sometimes give you insight into old languages.
2010-09-12T08:06:37  <bss03> But, partially because some of the tools I am getting used to using aren't readily available, I don't think my C++ would be much different than before I learned Haskell.
2010-09-12T08:08:11  <bss03> Then again, my C++ is getting somewhat rusty.  My last job a PHP, and before that was "plain" C.  I've probably forgetten some of the neat templating trick I learned.

2010-09-12T09:16:05  <javagamer_Cpp> In a for loop i++ and ++i are equivalent, right?  The difference is only when the statement contains other stuff like array[i++]

2010-09-12T09:16:46  <antimatroid> mightybite: neither, i made a comment just after
2010-09-12T09:17:12  <mightybyte> Ahh, yes.
2010-09-12T09:17:22  <antimatroid> javagamer_Cpp: yep, basically ++i increments i before using it, i++ uses i then increments it
2010-09-12T09:17:31  <antimatroid> if you do it in it's own line, it doesn't really matter
2010-09-12T09:17:50  <antimatroid> i'm doing a gross pde's assignment

2010-09-12T09:19:16  <antimatroid> albert: i took one 6 units this semester, i'm regretting that now with ai
2010-09-12T09:19:35  <Baphomet> does anyone know how to use the pw.Distance() function?
2010-09-12T09:19:41  <Baphomet> in c++
2010-09-12T09:19:49  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-09-12T09:19:57  <antimatroid> put in the two planet index numbers as parameters
2010-09-12T09:20:13  <antimatroid> although i suggest you index distances between planets on the first move as they're static
2010-09-12T09:20:37  <Baphomet> i wish i knew how to do these things
2010-09-12T09:20:51  <antimatroid> just have a global 2 dimensional vector ;)
2010-09-12T09:21:09  <Baphomet> i dont see how everyone understands all the functions so well
2010-09-12T09:21:21  <Baphomet> its not even documented anywhere what everything is
2010-09-12T09:21:36  <antimatroid> google "type c++"
2010-09-12T09:21:56  <albert> has anyone already reimplemented the game engine to c++? i asked that already a few days ago but now i am actually starting this. but maybe someone else already did it now
2010-09-12T09:21:58  <antimatroid> once you do a programming project you are actually interested in, you start wanting to do things you can't, so you go learn how to do those things
2010-09-12T09:22:03  <antimatroid> at least that's how it's working fo rme
2010-09-12T09:22:21  <antimatroid> albert: i pretty much completely redid planetwars last night
2010-09-12T09:22:30  <antimatroid> but i'm keeping that new copy private
2010-09-12T09:22:46  <Baphomet> i dont even know how to use the functions to get planet locations tho
2010-09-12T09:23:00  <Baphomet> because nothing is documented
2010-09-12T09:23:20  <antimatroid> Baphemot: look in planetwars.h and it'll give you the function definitions
2010-09-12T09:23:35  <antimatroid> i would also suggest getting rid of all privates and changing classes to structs
2010-09-12T09:23:41  <antimatroid> but i'm a communist when it comes to programming
2010-09-12T09:23:52  <albert> antimatroid: a why did you redid it? the engine itself? still in java/python or some other lang?
2010-09-12T09:24:04  <antimatroid> oh, not the actual engine sorry
2010-09-12T09:24:13  <antimatroid> just couldn't stand the way planet wars was written

2010-09-12T09:24:32  <antimatroid> especially having a new planet wars object created on every damn turn as well as creating planet and fleet vectors
2010-09-12T09:24:40  <antimatroid> it did not sit well with how I wanted fleets to be done
2010-09-12T09:24:46  <albert> yea
2010-09-12T09:25:43  <Baphomet> i could probbly work things out if i just knew what function returned planet locations :\
2010-09-12T09:26:05  <albert> i am reimplementing the game engine now in c++ (and will publish it when i'm finished). one standalone version which is just compatible to the old and also some functions to be able to use it in my bot as some easy forward simulations
2010-09-12T09:26:06  <Baphomet> do all the planets have preset id's or something?
2010-09-12T09:26:10  <antimatroid> Planets have functions to return X() and Y() from memory
2010-09-12T09:26:20  <antimatroid> but getter functions are the grosest thing ever invented
2010-09-12T09:26:29  <albert> antimatroid: full ack
2010-09-12T09:26:32  <Baphomet> :\ why?
2010-09-12T09:26:38  <ermau> Careful before you start a religious war
2010-09-12T09:26:51  <antimatroid> ermau: you say that like I wouldn't love it :D
2010-09-12T09:27:05  <antimatroid> Baphomot: I like to be able to just access what I want however I Want
2010-09-12T09:27:12  <ermau> Publicly exposed state is the grossest thing ever ;)
2010-09-12T09:27:18  <antimatroid> although I often end up with ridiculously complicated code as a result
2010-09-12T09:28:13  <Baphomet> ok well i see planet can get info about planets, but how does one know how many planets there are on the current map?
2010-09-12T09:28:17  <albert> hehe, yea, i guess it maybe really is a religious war. but in languages like c++ where you could reimplement some property wrapper member, there is really no point in having stuff public in the first place instead of having such dummy trivial wrapper getters/setters functions
2010-09-12T09:28:34  <braddunbar> albert: why would you reimplement the game engine in c++, for speed?  (i have a vague desire to do so in python as well, but i'm not sure why)
2010-09-12T09:28:40  <ermau> Smart compilers will inline those getters/setters anyway
2010-09-12T09:29:14  <Zaphus> big question... do I dare upload new code that works differently, does better than my old code against what I have to test with, but on *some* maps it does worse...  overall mathematically it seems better, but I risk losing my hard earned 15th place, I'll bet it will take a while to get that back even if I resubmitted the same bot :-)
2010-09-12T09:29:18  <albert> braddunbar: my bot is in c++ and i want to do some explorations on the game tree
2010-09-12T09:29:53  <antimatroid> Zaphus: don't worry about your place before the final tournament

2010-09-12T09:30:34  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  oh, I'm not worried about it in that sense, it's purely egotistacal at this point :-)
2010-09-12T09:30:59  <antimatroid> yes, but the fact that my bot is sitting in 40 atm says a lot about how poor they are
2010-09-12T09:31:26  <ermau> There are a _lot_ of starter bots running sadly
2010-09-12T09:31:31  <antimatroid> it is very poorly adding possible fleets to a priority queue with a very bad payoff function
2010-09-12T09:32:34  <antimatroid> i look forward to when people actually start implementing stuff
2010-09-12T09:33:16  <Zaphus> most people have spent a lot less time looking at the problem than those in the IRC :-)   apparently some of them even have lives !
2010-09-12T09:33:42  <antimatroid> what is that?
2010-09-12T09:33:43  <ermau> Or they followed the tutorial, submitted the starter bot, realized they don't have a clue how to do this and moved on
2010-09-12T09:34:14  <elijahbal> Current Rank: N/A. No ranking available
2010-09-12T09:34:15  <antimatroid> they will remove just starter package bots eventually
2010-09-12T09:34:21  <antimatroid> you wont have to deal with them in the final tournament
2010-09-12T09:34:31  <Baphomet> i may just give up, i cant really program anything
2010-09-12T09:34:43  <antimatroid> Baphomet: if you play around for a bit you will get going
2010-09-12T09:34:47  <ermau> antimatroid: Yeah, but they're taking up rounds _now_
2010-09-12T09:34:49  <antimatroid> then it really is a lot of fun
2010-09-12T09:34:56  <ermau> antimatroid: Guess that's why the TCP server is best
2010-09-12T09:35:01  <Zaphus> antimatroid: how will they know which ones are starter bots ?   with all the different variants of the way the tutorial could be typed in (including the fact that the C++ tutorial doesnt even work)
2010-09-12T09:35:06  <Baphomet> ive been trying for 2 days and i still struggle to defeat the default bot
2010-09-12T09:35:15  <antimatroid> ermau: tcp is best because you get lots of games against better bots
2010-09-12T09:35:17  <Baphomet> thats how bad i am
2010-09-12T09:35:22  <ermau> antimatroid: Yeah, no kidding
2010-09-12T09:35:41  <ermau> antimatroid: In the competition, I kept winning and winning.. tcp server I kept losing and losing
2010-09-12T09:35:44  <antimatroid> Zaphus: no idea, but the seemed to do a decent job of it last time
2010-09-12T09:35:56  <ermau> antimatroid: Though my bot has a couple big bugs, haven't gotten around to rewriting and taking a new approach
2010-09-12T09:36:05  <antimatroid> ermau: a lot of the top competitors from last time have already got their first play arounds up on there
2010-09-12T09:36:10  <antimatroid> i wouldn't take that too much to heart
2010-09-12T09:36:14  <Zaphus> I guess any bot submitted only once, right at the start, is a good clue - although alberts has done well :-)
2010-09-12T09:36:44  <ermau> antimatroid: Oh I'm not
2010-09-12T09:36:50  <canihazbacon> what's all this talk about a tcp server?
2010-09-12T09:37:00  <antimatroid> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/
2010-09-12T09:37:03  <ermau> antimatroid: I'm just pointing out how worthless the current entries in the real site are right now
2010-09-12T09:37:20  <antimatroid> yeah, it's going to be like that most of the contest unfortunately
2010-09-12T09:37:34  <antimatroid> you will get best games on tcp, but it's still cool to have the final tournament
2010-09-12T09:37:38  <ermau> I think some of these guys just have scripts running their bot on the tcp constantly
2010-09-12T09:37:43  <antimatroid> i wish they would run a final round robin on top x bots
2010-09-12T09:37:48  <antimatroid> they do
2010-09-12T09:38:14  <Baphomet> :\ im almost rank 500
2010-09-12T09:38:25  <ermau> I told myself if I get a couple features done on my main project that I can work on the AI bot :P
2010-09-12T09:38:26  <antimatroid> ermau: a lot of people will generate stats off those games to help improve their bots too
2010-09-12T09:38:30  <Baphomet> i swear my bot is getting worse
2010-09-12T09:38:33  <Zaphus> once I submit the new bot, the old playbacks become very hard to find, right ?
2010-09-12T09:38:34  <ermau> antimatroid: Right, tis what I figured
2010-09-12T09:38:45  <antimatroid> yep, although can be done
2010-09-12T09:38:47  <ermau> antimatroid: I'm not expecting anything, personally, it's just fun as hell.
2010-09-12T09:38:58  <elijahbal> Why I'm not ranked ?
2010-09-12T09:39:04  <antimatroid> i feel like i need to make up for last time, otherwise i wont be satisfied
2010-09-12T09:39:04  <elijahbal> my bot is too bad ?
2010-09-12T09:39:16  <vikhyat> elijahbal: when did you submit your bot?
2010-09-12T09:39:18  <antimatroid> elijahbal: takes a while for the server to allocate you a game
2010-09-12T09:39:23  <ermau> antimatroid: I wasn't around the last time, found out via an email from GalCon
2010-09-12T09:39:46  <antimatroid> i'm a little worried the bots might end up too good in this
2010-09-12T09:39:48  <canihazbacon> does the server notify you of matches, etc... ?
2010-09-12T09:39:50  <ermau> antimatroid: Last AI competition I looked at was for StarCraft, and that's a little over my head
2010-09-12T09:39:52  <antimatroid> and it's a mass of draws
2010-09-12T09:39:53  <antimatroid> but we'll see
2010-09-12T09:40:03  <canihazbacon> because i did not get any mails...

2010-09-12T10:11:05  <Baphomet> my bot sucks and i get heaps of games and loose em all
2010-09-12T10:11:10  <Appleman1234> so I am insomniac / nightowl by design
2010-09-12T10:11:23  <Baphomet> i mostly win when its a default bot or their bot crashes

2010-09-12T10:11:34  <antimatroid> baphoment: what is your bot doing?
2010-09-12T10:11:46  <Baphomet> nothing really i cant really program too well
2010-09-12T10:11:49  <antimatroid> i could offer you some suggestions, but i'm not willing to really share what I intend to implement for my final bot
2010-09-12T10:12:07  <Baphomet> i know how i would make it good, i just dont know how to implement anything
2010-09-12T10:12:10  <Doctor> does anyone have a script for windows to run a bot against all the available bots on all the maps...?
2010-09-12T10:12:11  <antimatroid> try considering what the number of fleets will be at another players planet in the time it takes your planet to send fleets there
2010-09-12T10:12:16  <antimatroid> and send the amount required to take it etc.
2010-09-12T10:12:34  <antimatroid> do you know how vectors work?
2010-09-12T10:12:38  <bobng> How long does a program have each turn before it times out?
2010-09-12T10:12:38  <Appleman1234> Doctor, a few people do, they aren't me
2010-09-12T10:12:39  <antimatroid> they are the most wonderful thing
2010-09-12T10:12:44  <xkpe> Is there a more detailed problem description anywhere? I have a few questions, like, what is the travel speed for the fleets, are the distances rounded or truncated?
2010-09-12T10:12:44  <antimatroid> 1 second
2010-09-12T10:12:48  <Baphomet> nop. i only have minimal c++ experance
2010-09-12T10:12:59  <antimatroid> xkpe: there is one in the works, not sure of the link
2010-09-12T10:13:02  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, then use another language
2010-09-12T10:13:05  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: you about?
2010-09-12T10:13:13  <Baphomet> i know more c++ than anything else.
2010-09-12T10:13:21  <Baphomet> i just dont know much about programming
2010-09-12T10:13:38  <AndroUser> well still python would be easier baphomet

2010-09-12T10:13:44  <Baphomet> maybe
2010-09-12T10:13:47  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, can you write what you want your bot to do in english ?
2010-09-12T10:13:50  <Baphomet> i will try it
2010-09-12T10:14:06  <Baphomet> i guess so
2010-09-12T10:14:08  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, if you can write your strategy in english or your native language
2010-09-12T10:14:11  <Baphomet> like psudocode?
2010-09-12T10:14:12  <antimatroid> if you are already somewhat comfortable with c++ i don't think changing to python is going to help
2010-09-12T10:14:24  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, like english
2010-09-12T10:14:24  <ermau> C# maybe

2010-09-12T10:14:42  <Baphomet> i dont think c# is really any easier than c++
2010-09-12T10:14:44  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, write it in forms you understand, then convert it to pseudocode
2010-09-12T10:14:58  <Appleman1234> then worry about the language implementation
2010-09-12T10:15:21  <antimatroid> i've never properly sat down and used anything but c++
2010-09-12T10:15:32  * Appleman1234 knows lots of languages
2010-09-12T10:15:36  <antimatroid> sit*
2010-09-12T10:15:59  <Baphomet> well ive heard before that python is easy so i may give that a look quickly
2010-09-12T10:16:03  <Appleman1234> C,C++,Python, Scheme / Racket, Javascript, C#, Java, Perl,etc
2010-09-12T10:16:07  <ermau> I "know" C++, I'm just not comfortable with it and I don't like it.
2010-09-12T10:16:29  <antimatroid> every time i use c++ i learn something new
2010-09-12T10:16:30  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, what parts of the c++ are you having issues with ?
2010-09-12T10:16:44  <ermau> C# is my typical weapon of choice
2010-09-12T10:16:49  <Baphomet> knowing what all the functions do
2010-09-12T10:16:57  <Baphomet> and how to work with the functions
2010-09-12T10:17:09  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, just read the PlanetWars.h
2010-09-12T10:17:17  <Baphomet> and correct syntax/usage/implementation
2010-09-12T10:17:20  <antimatroid> your DoTurn function in planetwars.cc takes in a PlanetWars object
2010-09-12T10:17:28  <antimatroid> that contains a vector of fleets and a vector of planets
2010-09-12T10:17:33  <antimatroid> is that new?
2010-09-12T10:17:47  <xkpe> vikhyat, ty
2010-09-12T10:17:50  <Baphomet> is a vector similar to an array?
2010-09-12T10:18:02  <antimatroid> yes, except it's size is dynamic
2010-09-12T10:18:12  <antimatroid> without having to worry about all the dynamic memory crap
2010-09-12T10:18:26  <ermau> TBH, if you don't know what a vector is, I say you really don't know C++.
2010-09-12T10:18:33  <Baphomet> webservr is being all flaky again
2010-09-12T10:18:43  <antimatroid> ermau: he said he knows c++ more than anything else, not that he knows c++
2010-09-12T10:18:51  <Baphomet> i know, i never said i was any good at c++, i have basic skils at best
2010-09-12T10:19:15  <Baphomet> just played round making a few console based programs etc
2010-09-12T10:19:21  <Baphomet> nothing really complicated
2010-09-12T10:19:34  <ermau> Sorry, missed the distinction
2010-09-12T10:19:36  <antimatroid> baphomet, i would suggest playing around with console apps again to work out how vectors work
2010-09-12T10:19:38  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, your bot won't be really complicated either
2010-09-12T10:20:24  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, also see http://cplusplus.com/ and http://cprogramming.com
2010-09-12T10:20:33  <Appleman1234> the second site has a c++ tutorial
2010-09-12T10:20:42  <Baphomet> antimatroid: yea i have done some small console programs. Appleman1234: yea i know i just dont know how to work with this stuff too well
2010-09-12T10:21:02  <Baphomet> k i will take a look at those
2010-09-12T10:21:04  <Appleman1234> Baphomet, practice makes perfect, the compiler will tell you if you are wrong
2010-09-12T10:21:15  <Baphomet> hehe....yea...it does....
2010-09-12T10:21:39  <antimatroid> whenever I don't know how to use something in c++, google "vector c++" and it'll show up one of the c++ reference page telling you the different functions it has and variabls etc.
2010-09-12T10:21:52  <Appleman1234> errors the compiler tells you are easy to fix for the most part
2010-09-12T10:21:54  <antimatroid> Appleman1234: not if it's semantically wrong :P
2010-09-12T10:22:18  <Appleman1234> antimatroid, yes and no, depending on your setup
2010-09-12T10:22:33  <Appleman1234> but no need to debate here
2010-09-12T10:22:55  <antimatroid> it was not intended to form a debate, just a pokey comment :)
2010-09-12T10:22:59  <Appleman1234> and the googling the error strategy also works for the most part
2010-09-12T10:23:17  <Appleman1234> do the hokey pokey and you turn about
2010-09-12T10:23:26  <Appleman1234> and that's what it is all about

2010-09-12T10:53:08  <edcba> i have some questions :
2010-09-12T10:53:12  <antimatroid> shoot
2010-09-12T10:53:18  <Appleman1234> bbl
2010-09-12T10:53:24  <edcba> is a turn is time limited ?
2010-09-12T10:53:30  <antimatroid> yes, one second
2010-09-12T10:53:39  <edcba> ok
2010-09-12T10:53:51  <antimatroid> if you exceed that you get disqualified, so be careful
2010-09-12T10:53:58  <edcba> are maps randomly generated during contest ?
2010-09-12T10:54:13  <antimatroid> no, but they aren't necessarily all going to be the same set you started with
2010-09-12T10:54:43  <antimatroid> besides, you want bots playing on the same maps
2010-09-12T10:54:54  <edcba> that means some are in the set some aren't ?
2010-09-12T10:54:58  <antimatroid> i would personally like a fresh set of maps used on the final tournament, but i wouldn't count on it
2010-09-12T10:55:20  <antimatroid> no, that means you shouldn't count on it being either case
2010-09-12T10:55:27  <edcba> ok lol
2010-09-12T10:55:32  <antimatroid> but it could be a combination of the two etc. etc.
2010-09-12T10:57:36  <bartwe> wow, i won a game again a1kon-0.2

2010-09-12T11:01:10  <jmcarthur> well, it looks bidirectional, also
2010-09-12T11:01:40  <bartwe> i found that feeding through the intermediate planets allows me more flexibility to redirect and protect other nodes

2010-09-12T11:02:50  <jmcarthur> i suspect it's confusing opponents that only look at what planets can immediately send to points of conflict and are not really paying attention to planets that will be able to send out forces on the next couple turns

2010-09-12T11:03:39  <bartwe> one of the future extensions i'm planning is delaying attacks
2010-09-12T11:03:55  <bartwe> alot of attacks use just enough power
2010-09-12T11:03:58  <bartwe> like my own
2010-09-12T11:04:08  <bartwe> which allows me to send just enough defense mostly
2010-09-12T11:04:37  <bartwe> having all planets do a synchronized attack on a single point would be fun :)

2010-09-12T11:05:06  <edcba> maybe the last but one turn ?

2010-09-12T11:05:08  <anoek> Is there a maximum number of planets on any given map?

2010-09-12T11:05:51  <anoek> i'd say so
2010-09-12T11:06:12  <edcba> 3 won't be less boring i guess
2010-09-12T11:06:25  <jmcarthur> i think 3 could be a good degenerate map for testing
2010-09-12T11:06:34  <antimatroid> i was going to say, if you want a fun afternoon with pen and paper, sit down with the 3+ planet case
2010-09-12T11:06:35  <jmcarthur> 4 maybe better
2010-09-12T11:06:50  <jmcarthur> above 4 they start to blur in my head
2010-09-12T11:07:02  <antimatroid> the number of variables is insane
2010-09-12T11:07:06  <jmcarthur> yeah even 3 can be a mind job if you look at the game theory behind it
2010-09-12T11:07:21  <jmcarthur> this is a great game for an AI contest
2010-09-12T11:07:38  <antimatroid> i'm still unsure how well people will get to approximating perfect play
2010-09-12T11:07:41  <anoek> so no official maximum yet?
2010-09-12T11:07:43  <antimatroid> i hope it doesn't get too bad
2010-09-12T11:07:48  <antimatroid> anoek: nope
2010-09-12T11:07:50  <anoek> okie
2010-09-12T11:07:52  <edcba> is the website down again ?
2010-09-12T11:08:02  <Baphomet> probbly
2010-09-12T11:08:04  <ermau> The DB is getting destroyed
2010-09-12T11:08:06  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: "too bad" == too close to perfect or too far from perfect?
2010-09-12T11:08:11  <ermau> Gave me a too many connections error a second ago
2010-09-12T11:08:16  <jmcarthur> yeah me too
2010-09-12T11:08:23  <jmcarthur> we really need to get those bots on other machines now
2010-09-12T11:08:32  <jmcarthur> actually
2010-09-12T11:08:48  <jmcarthur> the TM doesn't really use much db anymore, does it?
2010-09-12T11:08:58  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i hope the top bots don't end up just drawing all the time
2010-09-12T11:09:03  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: ah
2010-09-12T11:09:15  <antimatroid> but so far it looks like the games diverge quite well to a clear winner
2010-09-12T11:09:18  <j3camero> is anyone else seeing the site is down right now?
2010-09-12T11:09:19  <jmcarthur> i am leaning toward the top bots actually having more variety in this one than in the tron one
2010-09-12T11:09:26  <jmcarthur> j3camero: db connections
2010-09-12T11:09:27  <antimatroid> but depends how well people penetrate near perfect play (or even perfect)
2010-09-12T11:09:32  <bartwe> antimatroid: if you have a near-perfect player, please put it up against others at benzedrine
2010-09-12T11:09:34  <antimatroid> j3camero: yep
2010-09-12T11:09:37  <jmcarthur> j3camero: find a way to lower them or close them more quickly
2010-09-12T11:09:56  <antimatroid> bartwe: i don't, although i am not ruling out trying that as an option
2010-09-12T11:10:02  <antimatroid> although that is not the aim is it not :P
2010-09-12T11:10:11  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: perfect play seems very hard to approach considering the variables involved, though
2010-09-12T11:10:22  <antimatroid> hence the near perfect
2010-09-12T11:10:29  <jmcarthur> heance the "approach"
2010-09-12T11:10:33  <jmcarthur> *hence, even

2010-09-12T11:11:05  <bartwe> i think another obstacle to 'perfect play' is that it is dependent on the opponent
2010-09-12T11:11:17  <jmcarthur> bartwe: we are defining perfect play slightly differently here
2010-09-12T11:11:26  <antimatroid> j3camero: a lot of bots are just starter packages getting games, is there a way to stop that?
2010-09-12T11:11:26  <bartwe> so this is closer to a nash equilibrium that solving a math problem
2010-09-12T11:11:42  <bartwe> jmcarthur: huh ?
2010-09-12T11:11:56  <antimatroid> playing a nash equilibrium could somewhat be considered perfect play
2010-09-12T11:11:57  <jmcarthur> bartwe: perfect play in a simultaneous play game is assigning the exact best *probabilities* to each possible move
2010-09-12T11:12:30  <bartwe> jmcarthur: which is uncalculable if there are multiple nash peaks
2010-09-12T11:12:30  <jmcarthur> right, the nash equilibrium is almost certainly going to be mixed strategies
2010-09-12T11:12:53  <bartwe> or very boring rock/paper/shotgun solutions
2010-09-12T11:13:28  <jmcarthur> that just means that two perfect players will converge to a draw over an infinite number of games
2010-09-12T11:13:35  <antimatroid> not necessarily uncalculable, although it is for this game and time constraints
2010-09-12T11:13:54  <jmcarthur> the existence of multiple nash equilbriums is not very significant
2010-09-12T11:14:01  <antimatroid> i'm intending to do a small thesis next year on calculating mixed strategy nash equilibria in n-player finite normal form games
2010-09-12T11:14:05  <j3camero> danielfvf: if you're around, I am going to try restarting the mysql server to see if the site will come back up.
2010-09-12T11:14:11  <bartwe> antimatroid: its not calculable if you need to include the precise probs of other players
2010-09-12T11:14:24  <jmcarthur> it just means that perfect play may not be very reliable
2010-09-12T11:14:37  <antimatroid> i think trying to calculate anything like that for this is not going to get someone very far though
2010-09-12T11:14:39  <antimatroid> but i could be wrong
2010-09-12T11:14:44  <jmcarthur> bartwe: perfect play would assume that the opponent is also perfect
2010-09-12T11:14:48  <Naktibalda> j3camero: have you some slow queries running in mysql? or is it just too many visitors?
2010-09-12T11:15:00  <bartwe> jmcarthur: collections that contain themselves
2010-09-12T11:15:03  <jmcarthur> bartwe: there are known algorithms for this, they just have terrible complexities
2010-09-12T11:15:18  <jmcarthur> bartwe: i'm sorry, i don't see how russel plays into this

2010-09-12T11:15:38  <jmcarthur> this isn't about a system describing itself
2010-09-12T11:16:23  <Baphomet> whats a website i can dump text to?
2010-09-12T11:16:24  <j3camero> I am actually going to try shutting down apache, killing all the remaining connections, then restarting. Hopefully the site won't tank immediately afterwards.
2010-09-12T11:16:26  <jmcarthur> bartwe: my point is you don't *have* to find all nash equilbriums. they are all equal. just find one and hope your perfect opponent picks a different one
2010-09-12T11:16:29  <Naktibalda> j3camero: wasn't a connection limit of apache increased yesterday? mysql connection limit must be higher than that + non-apache connections
2010-09-12T11:16:43  <jmcarthur> well, the hope is unnecessary, my bad
2010-09-12T11:16:49  <jmcarthur> *just pick one.
2010-09-12T11:16:49  <Strepto> Baphomet: http://pastebin.com/
2010-09-12T11:17:01  <Baphomet> thanks, thats the one i was thinking of
2010-09-12T11:17:15  <Baphomet> for some reason i must be googling all the wrong words
2010-09-12T11:18:15  <j3camero> It's currently floating around the maxclients limit for apache. This is probably the problem.
2010-09-12T11:18:29  <Naktibalda> j3camero: restarting is just a temporary sollution with many unhappy users
2010-09-12T11:18:43  <canihazbacon> how about using lighty?
2010-09-12T11:18:46  <Baphomet> anyway antimatroid i was saying earlier i have alil c++ experance, i found one of my programs i wrote about 2 years ago. http://pastebin.com/qg3yAn8w
2010-09-12T11:19:16  <Baphomet> obviously not that complex
2010-09-12T11:19:41  <Baphomet> should i just give up on this ai contest or do i have a chance of making something decent?
2010-09-12T11:19:55  <Naktibalda> j3camero:  can you pastebin output of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;

2010-09-12T11:20:16  <Strepto> Baphomet: it's definitely worth a try, I'm not a programmer by trade and I've gotten off to a decen start
2010-09-12T11:20:38  <Strepto> managed to beat MyBot with a few hours orientation

2010-09-12T11:21:03  <Baphomet> i will be rage if i loose a hdd
2010-09-12T11:21:06  <Strepto> confirm it

2010-09-12T11:23:10  <Baphomet> just need a good webserv
2010-09-12T11:23:42  <antimatroid> Baphomet: I'm probably not really the right person to ask, but I don't see why you couldn't get at least some kind of strategy going, learn a whole lot and have fun while you're doing it
2010-09-12T11:24:06  <jmcarthur> apache isn't as easy to configure for heavy loads. it can be done, but some of the other web servers are nicer out of the box
2010-09-12T11:24:32  <edcba> Baphomet: quite sure you won't win but at least you'll learn some while attempting at it
2010-09-12T11:24:33  <antimatroid> worst comes to worst you give up right?

2010-09-12T11:25:14  <antimatroid> i am looking for at least top 50, but not expecting to win
2010-09-12T11:25:16  <antimatroid> would be nice though
2010-09-12T11:25:35  <jmcarthur> yeah i feel like i could have gotten top 50 last time if i had spent maybe 4 more hours on my bot :\
2010-09-12T11:25:42  <edcba> so when the site is up can you see previous matches and where ? :)
2010-09-12T11:25:45  <jmcarthur> but instead i only had this half broken thing uploaded
2010-09-12T11:25:55  <ermau> antimatroid: Same here
2010-09-12T11:26:15  <antimatroid> top 10 and i'll be stoked
2010-09-12T11:26:22  <a1k0n> i almost uploaded a different version of my bot at the last hour and i'm so glad i didn't
2010-09-12T11:26:27  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-12T11:26:36  <antimatroid> a1k0n: why not?
2010-09-12T11:26:36  <jmcarthur> i wish i had
2010-09-12T11:26:43  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: because he won?
2010-09-12T11:26:54  <a1k0n> and the other bot's improvement was questionable
2010-09-12T11:27:26  <Strepto> question regarding nash equilibria: even if two players are using stuck in a nash equilibrium, that could still mean (in context of the contest) that one player could have a higher net ship growth per turn, and ultimately win the game?
2010-09-12T11:27:27  <antimatroid> oh, i thought he was referring to like an hour ago :P
2010-09-12T11:27:33  <a1k0n> oh haha
2010-09-12T11:27:43  <a1k0n> yeah the last hour of the last contest, sorry

2010-09-12T11:28:33  <Strepto> helps to know if it's worth to evaluate starting conditions or not :)
2010-09-12T11:28:51  <bartwe> looks like i finally found a heuristic that can match you 0.2 at times :)
2010-09-12T11:29:00  <a1k0n> haha
2010-09-12T11:29:09  <edcba> Strepto: nash equilibrium can break just before 200 turns i guess :)
2010-09-12T11:29:37  <a1k0n> wow a1k0n-0.2 and drewrobb0.31 are neck and neck
2010-09-12T11:29:54  <a1k0n> though i'm pretty sure deepblue is better when it's playing
2010-09-12T11:30:09  <edcba> a1k0n: how do you see that ?

2010-09-12T11:32:22  <a1k0n> yeah, a1k0n-0.2 is just arithmetic on incoming fleets.

2010-09-12T11:32:54  <bartwe> not seeing that in its actions
2010-09-12T11:33:01  <bartwe> it is a bit passive at times

2010-09-12T11:33:14  <a1k0n> it thinks it's better to take neutrals all at once so it saves up for them
2010-09-12T11:33:27  <antimatroid> word to that
2010-09-12T11:33:30  <bartwe> my search is alot less wide
2010-09-12T11:33:32  <antimatroid> it's a waste otherwise
2010-09-12T11:33:57  <a1k0n> yeah.  except, it's definitely a waste if you send N+1 ships to an N-size neutral that's right next to your opponent...

2010-09-12T11:44:28  <jmcarthur> like at 200 turns if one player has twice as many ships as the other it's a win, otherwise it continues, and the minimum ratio necessary to win gets smaller over time
2010-09-12T11:44:30  <a1k0n> yes, 10 ships at a time
2010-09-12T11:44:53  <bartwe> i think it would do better with more predicition
2010-09-12T11:45:52  <rwa> dhartmei's bot has my number.  I squeak out wins against most other higher ranked bots, but not his
2010-09-12T11:47:06  <a1k0n> which one's yours on benzedrine?
2010-09-12T11:47:07  <jmcarthur> i find the idea that A can beat B, B can beat C, and C can beat A interesting in tournaments like this. would be interesting to analyzing some game data to look for such cases
2010-09-12T11:47:18  <jmcarthur> *analyze
2010-09-12T11:47:39  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: do PCA and find a N-dimensional Elo score
2010-09-12T11:47:52  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: that is actually exactly what i was thinking

2010-09-12T11:48:27  <jmcarthur> i wonder how significant the second factor would be

2010-09-12T11:51:15  <jmcarthur> wow
2010-09-12T11:51:42  <jmcarthur> the binary for my bot, stripped and zipped, is 5.3M...
2010-09-12T11:51:59  <jmcarthur> i wonder if ghc head is including a bunch of stuff that 6.12.3 wouldn't...
2010-09-12T11:52:09  <rwa> a1kon: my bot is vortex (with variant numbers, but not vortex3636 - that's someone else)
2010-09-12T11:52:24  <a1k0n> rwa: ahh
2010-09-12T11:53:43  <bartwe> if i wanted to lower someones elo, i'd just put up an example bot on their name
2010-09-12T11:53:47  <jmcarthur> bzip2 squeezes out 4.2M
2010-09-12T11:53:58  <bartwe> so don't put too much trust in names
2010-09-12T11:54:22  <rwa> bartwe - you mean on the tcp server?
2010-09-12T11:54:29  <jmcarthur> would be nice to have some sort of authentication
2010-09-12T11:54:33  <bartwe> yes
2010-09-12T11:54:47  <bartwe> simple pass or hash
2010-09-12T11:54:54  <jmpespxoreax> pgp
2010-09-12T11:55:11  <jmcarthur> even a simple password would be nicer than nothing
2010-09-12T11:55:31  <bartwe> nah, something withouh accounts would be preferable
2010-09-12T11:55:35  <jmcarthur> no registration even needed. just use a password and as long as you keep using the same one it keeps updating the same bot stats
2010-09-12T11:55:45  <bartwe> ah, that works
2010-09-12T11:55:50  <a1k0n> hey the site's fast again and i'm getting games again
2010-09-12T11:56:21  <jmcarthur> and if you use the same bot name with a different password it just shows as botname(2) or something
2010-09-12T11:56:30  <elijahbal> Huh
2010-09-12T11:56:44  <elijahbal> Can you just make one IssueOrder() a round ?

2010-09-12T11:59:20  <a1k0n> people always ask me that, and i don't have a good answer
2010-09-12T11:59:51  <a1k0n> i spent many evenings for two weeks or so
2010-09-12T12:00:47  <a1k0n> but it kind of became an obsession and i couldn't stop thinking about it
2010-09-12T12:00:49  <jmpespxoreax> check your commit logs :P
2010-09-12T12:01:13  <bartwe> that reminds me
2010-09-12T12:01:14  <a1k0n> yeah, those don't show how much time is pent on a given patch but it gives a rough guess
2010-09-12T12:01:17  <bartwe> i should commit
2010-09-12T12:02:02  <Mathnerd314> a1k0n: so you just kept thinking about the contest all day long?
2010-09-12T12:02:30  <bartwe> you should compete in the icfpcontest
2010-09-12T12:02:38  <bartwe> shorter, easier to keep the focus for 72hours
2010-09-12T12:02:48  <a1k0n> Mathnerd314: well, more or less
2010-09-12T12:02:54  <rwa> the site is fast and games are working, but submission doesn't seem to be working now
2010-09-12T12:03:03  <a1k0n> bartwe: i usually do.  i can't *believe* i forgot about the last one
2010-09-12T12:03:15  <bartwe> geh
2010-09-12T12:03:24  <bartwe> it was an ok one, not one of the best
2010-09-12T12:03:41  <bartwe> i think you would have done well
2010-09-12T12:03:53  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: that's basically what happens to me
2010-09-12T12:03:54  <RainCT> Okay, I think I'll start working on a bot now. I'm not sure I'll have enough time to do much, but two weeks doesn't sound that bad.
2010-09-12T12:03:58  <a1k0n> the thing is, i'm usually out spending time with the family on weekends these days
2010-09-12T12:04:06  <jmcarthur> i can't get it out of my head even as i try to do other things (like work)
2010-09-12T12:04:17  <bartwe> icfpcontest this year was a milestone for me, first one that i did in 100% pluk a compiler/language i wrote
2010-09-12T12:04:26  <a1k0n> nice
2010-09-12T12:04:30  <jmcarthur> bartwe: awesome! i still haven't done icfp
2010-09-12T12:04:45  <rwa> a1kon:  if you're anything like me, family saves you a bit from being too obsessive about things
2010-09-12T12:04:46  <a1k0n> that's what i want to do some day
2010-09-12T12:04:49  <jmcarthur> bartwe: any links for pluk?
2010-09-12T12:05:11  <jmcarthur> bartwe: oh were you the one wondering about being able to use pluk for the contest?
2010-09-12T12:05:23  <jmcarthur> i recall that language name vaguely, i think from that
2010-09-12T12:05:41  <bartwe> jmcarthur: yes, pluk-lang.org its not really for public consumption
2010-09-12T12:05:41  <RainCT> jmcarthur: I've found http://bitbucket.org/bartwe/plukc/wiki/Home
2010-09-12T12:05:57  <a1k0n> rwa: yeah, exactly.  and it seems better work comes from taking breaks and then focusing for short periods
2010-09-12T12:05:59  <bartwe> RainCT: check
2010-09-12T12:06:13  <jmcarthur> bartwe: cool, i'll peek at it

2010-09-12T12:07:28  <jmcarthur> bartwe: so what would you say is pluk's claim to fame?
2010-09-12T12:07:57  <rwa> speaking of which I need to make food for my kids... hope submissions can be fixed soon
2010-09-12T12:08:22  <bartwe> jmcarthur: none, its a hobby project, it doesn't have a xsignificant company/communicty
2010-09-12T12:08:30  <bartwe> andi build compilers, not communities

2010-09-12T12:15:01  <jmcarthur> how is the sf bay area? i've never been there
2010-09-12T12:15:08  <a1k0n> ah, cool.  i'm in sunnyvale.
2010-09-12T12:15:21  <jmcarthur> considering applying for some things there
2010-09-12T12:15:26  <a1k0n> it's.. sunny and warm in the valley.  all the time.
2010-09-12T12:15:40  <a1k0n> expensive as hell to live here.
2010-09-12T12:15:42  <rwa> I interviewed at Lockheed there once awhile back
2010-09-12T12:16:06  <a1k0n> a friend of mine works there, though i haven't seen him in a long time
2010-09-12T12:16:27  <rwa> I declined their offer when my senior manager, probably 65 years old, worked in a tiny, open, noisy cube
2010-09-12T12:16:35  <jmcarthur> i grew up in rural areas. whenever i interview in a big city i feel like i would miss the openness if i was to move and work there
2010-09-12T12:17:03  <a1k0n> i lived in a pretty rural area until recently.  there's plenty of openness in CA, it's just full of people
2010-09-12T12:17:24  <jmcarthur> full of people makes me feel kind of closed in :\
2010-09-12T12:17:43  <antimatroid> i live in tasmania, it's awesome
2010-09-12T12:17:49  <jmcarthur> but at least there is some openness, i guess
2010-09-12T12:17:51  <antimatroid> i hate queues
2010-09-12T12:18:02  <antimatroid> i don't mind using them in a program, but partaking in them makes me rage
2010-09-12T12:18:52  <jmcarthur> i like stacks because the later i arrive the sooner i leave
2010-09-12T12:18:57  <antimatroid> even sitting at a traffic light in a car for 2 minutes makes me want to rip someones throat out
2010-09-12T12:19:07  <antimatroid> :)
2010-09-12T12:19:16  <a1k0n> heh.  you sound like my two year old
2010-09-12T12:19:31  <rwa> a1kon: you think it's expensive now, you should have seen things 5-6 years ago
2010-09-12T12:19:36  <jmcarthur> you're two year old talks about queues and stacks?
2010-09-12T12:19:45  <jmcarthur> &your

2010-09-12T12:31:51  <caytchen> Palmik: on tcp you die when your last fleet arrived and you have no planets.

2010-09-12T12:32:33  <a1k0n> do you do any game tree searching or anything btw?

2010-09-12T12:33:10  <drewrobb> no, my bot is just heuristics stuff for now
2010-09-12T12:33:52  <a1k0n> hmm, ok
2010-09-12T12:34:19  <Palmik> Hehe, first page ends with player ranked 99th and second starts with player ranked 101st
2010-09-12T12:34:20  <drewrobb> i was running a bunch of other tests, maybe the the CPU time it gets is less as the system is loaded?
2010-09-12T12:34:38  <drewrobb> maybe it is a big statistical fluctiation?
2010-09-12T12:34:43  <a1k0n> well, does that even matter?  it wouldn't for mine, it's deterministic
2010-09-12T12:34:48  <drewrobb> maybe deepblue was keeping me down?
2010-09-12T12:35:08  <a1k0n> could be, but he was bringin' me down too.  i guess it's just randomness.
2010-09-12T12:35:18  <a1k0n> our confidence intervals overlap
2010-09-12T12:35:24  <drewrobb> mine search random actions at depth 1 for .1 sec

2010-09-12T12:35:39  <drewrobb> but yeah, for testing i keep it deterministic
2010-09-12T12:35:47  <drewrobb> depth 1?
2010-09-12T12:36:00  <drewrobb> i just consider random moves for myself

2010-09-12T12:37:59  <drewrobb> but yeah, i also limit search to 1 move ammount
2010-09-12T12:38:04  <a1k0n> the next generation of bots should be interesting
2010-09-12T12:38:10  <a1k0n> speak of the devil
2010-09-12T12:38:15  <deepblue> morning :)
2010-09-12T12:38:26  <deepblue> next step: skynet
2010-09-12T12:39:14  <deepblue> after what time do the games get removed on the tcp server?
2010-09-12T12:39:34  <drewrobb> it seems to be rolling
2010-09-12T12:39:52  <a1k0n> yeah, not sure exactly how many games it holds onto but it does roll the out
2010-09-12T12:39:59  <deepblue> ah ok
2010-09-12T12:40:05  <a1k0n> your absense has switched mine and drewrobb's ranking it seems
2010-09-12T12:40:09  <deepblue> so lots of games happens while I was asleep :)
2010-09-12T12:40:09  <edcba> how much planets max in official tournament ?
2010-09-12T12:40:26  <a1k0n> edcba: they didn't say, but they did say it won't be significantly more than the maps have now
2010-09-12T12:41:10  <a1k0n> deepblue: i just have my machine at work cranking them out
2010-09-12T12:41:11  <deepblue> let's hope not too many more
2010-09-12T12:41:28  <caytchen> contestbot: rankings
2010-09-12T12:41:29  <contestbot> caytchen: Top 10 players: dmj111(2835), braddunbar(2815), albert(2792), seigen(2732), Kavish(2707), drewrobb(2695), Obeleh(2679), wtfbbq(2679), sighbot(2676), tinasky(2661)
2010-09-12T12:41:35  <a1k0n> yeah i think a few O(N^2) operations are unavoidable
2010-09-12T12:41:35  <deepblue> I just started my bot again
2010-09-12T12:41:43  <a1k0n> me too
2010-09-12T12:42:02  <a1k0n> i need to start writing code and stop writing irc messages
2010-09-12T12:42:19  <deepblue> this random matching on the official server makes climbing so slow
2010-09-12T12:42:31  <drewrobb> yes, this irc channel is very distracting
2010-09-12T12:42:34  <deepblue> and I have buggy code uploaded, takes so loooong

2010-09-12T12:44:38  <drewrobb> i should just spam deepblue: every few minutes to keep you from getting focused
2010-09-12T12:44:52  <deepblue> ahhh ;)
2010-09-12T12:46:10  <deepblue> top10 I'm coming! already up to 25th place on the official
2010-09-12T12:46:50  <a1k0n> i lost my totally unfair #1 place :(
2010-09-12T12:47:15  <deepblue> let's see if I can reserve it for you ;)
2010-09-12T12:47:21  <a1k0n> i bet albert and dmj111 are afraid to resubmit
2010-09-12T12:47:44  <deepblue> I hope I get lucky and can play one game against them
2010-09-12T12:47:54  <deepblue> that would be a reason to resubmit
2010-09-12T12:48:02  <drewrobb> i should probably resubmit

2010-09-12T12:48:14  <deepblue> so far all the games I had on the official server were anywhere close to dangerous for me :/
2010-09-12T12:48:16  <RobinB> is there an inofficial server?

2010-09-12T12:49:06  <RobinB> ah i see, thanks
2010-09-12T12:49:12  <RobinB> and that's faster, i presume?
2010-09-12T12:49:25  <RobinB> i guess with 58 players, it would be

2010-09-12T12:49:34  <a1k0n> well you run your own bot on your own computer
2010-09-12T12:49:39  <phreeza> a1k0n: albert hasn't been working on the bot the last few days due to work but i think today he is
2010-09-12T12:49:41  <deepblue> even with the bug still in there it wins hands down
2010-09-12T12:49:46  <virtualmike> Hi, anyone know if regestration is still working? been waiting over 24 hours for my confirmation email (to a gmail address, its not in the spamfilter)
2010-09-12T12:50:02  <bartwe> hmz
2010-09-12T12:50:10  <bartwe> i see server errors on benzedrine
2010-09-12T12:50:11  <phreeza> a1k0n: but he has some incremental changes already so you are right a little bit ;)
2010-09-12T12:50:20  <bartwe> units that aren't moving
2010-09-12T12:50:43  <a1k0n> phreeza: hehe, i changed just one number and totally gave up a top-3 bot
2010-09-12T12:50:52  <a1k0n> s/bot/spot/ anyway
2010-09-12T12:51:38  <phreeza> yea... shouldn't read too much into the rankings right now i think
2010-09-12T12:51:45  <retybok> Anyone using non-heuristic methods?
2010-09-12T12:51:58  <antimatroid> not yet
2010-09-12T12:52:06  <deepblue> how? the state space is gigantic
2010-09-12T12:52:18  <retybok> I'm trying to think how to implement one, but it seems incredibly hard
2010-09-12T12:52:19  <antimatroid> you can still calculate some things
2010-09-12T12:52:27  <a1k0n> yeah i might be doing a very narrowly directed search if any

2010-09-12T12:54:35  <antimatroid> although they're being rather poorly thrown together
2010-09-12T12:54:53  <deepblue> right now it's running on a mac server at the university since my home internet is so sketchy
2010-09-12T12:55:16  <elijahbal> Hey.  The server do not want to run my bot.
2010-09-12T12:55:27  <elijahbal> 30 minutes
2010-09-12T12:55:29  <elijahbal> it's al lot

2010-09-12T12:56:09  <deepblue> elijahbal be patient the server are slow
2010-09-12T12:56:22  <elijahbal> btw
2010-09-12T12:56:33  <elijahbal> deepblue : are you a bot ?
2010-09-12T12:56:55  * deepblue is alive
2010-09-12T12:57:03  <deepblue> flesh and blood and all
2010-09-12T12:57:04  <elijahbal> deepblue : 1s is a lot for run this game
2010-09-12T12:57:06  <phreeza> antimatroid: is this some very nerdy way of talking smack?
2010-09-12T12:57:08  <phreeza> :D
2010-09-12T12:57:13  <bobng> D:
2010-09-12T12:57:32  <elijahbal> A lot of cpu time. Why dont you make the game a bit more challenging and say 0.1s  ?
2010-09-12T12:57:34  <deepblue> elijahbal: i could need way more time then 1sec :)
2010-09-12T12:57:39  <antimatroid> i was talking about my heuristics, not yours :)
2010-09-12T12:57:45  <antimatroid> took me a minute to work out what you meant
2010-09-12T12:57:51  <phreeza> ah hehehe ok :)
2010-09-12T12:58:06  <phreeza> ah yea ok i misread, sorry
2010-09-12T12:58:13  <phreeza> missed the "my"
2010-09-12T12:58:20  <deepblue> or lets put it that way I will put 0.1s, 1s or 2hours all to good use :)
2010-09-12T12:58:26  <Palmik> just found this in the starter package http://codepad.org/TJSSxArB maybe the rwrite is not bad idea :)
2010-09-12T12:58:49  <jmcarthur> okay, the scheduler should be something like this: take the bots with large confidence intervals and match them against bots with maximally overlapping confidence intervals
2010-09-12T12:58:59  <jmcarthur> i think that should narrow down those confidence intervals the most quickly
2010-09-12T12:59:01  <a1k0n> Palmik: i know, ridiculous isn't it?
2010-09-12T12:59:07  <antimatroid> i can't believe i didn't get on tcp server last time, so much better

2010-09-12T13:01:11  <a1k0n> the input parsing is also terrible

2010-09-12T13:01:47  <jmcarthur> no offense to jaspervdj, but that haskell starter has some slow IO/parsing

2010-09-12T13:02:20  <a1k0n> a1k0n-0.2 focuses all effort on a lost cause, and then loses
2010-09-12T13:02:32  <drewrobb> anyone think that this is optimal play?

2010-09-12T13:03:04  <deepblue> lol
2010-09-12T13:03:06  <jmcarthur> i doubt that is optimal
2010-09-12T13:03:10  <jmcarthur> i've seen a few of those now
2010-09-12T13:03:11  <deepblue> i want to play leopold!
2010-09-12T13:03:12  <a1k0n> drewrobb: haha, a draw!
2010-09-12T13:03:14  <elijahbal> actually my program do not take a lot of cpu time
2010-09-12T13:03:20  <elijahbal> 0.001 at his worst
2010-09-12T13:03:25  <drewrobb> maybe not optimal, but would it draw with optimal play?
2010-09-12T13:03:36  <RainCT> Guest77645: Ah, found it. Thanks.
2010-09-12T13:03:55  <deepblue> the maps are symmetric so it should be a draw?
2010-09-12T13:04:08  <deepblue> if both play the same optimal strategie
2010-09-12T13:04:10  <antimatroid> games like that should be a draw
2010-09-12T13:04:14  <jmcarthur> honestly i think a fair win in that match would have been for mcleopold to win it since he was the one laying on the pressure
2010-09-12T13:04:15  <drewrobb> not if there is a mixed equilibrium
2010-09-12T13:04:21  <antimatroid> i like the idea of extending it, then a certain radius would define a draw
2010-09-12T13:04:21  <a1k0n> wow lulin4 is no pushover
2010-09-12T13:04:26  <jmcarthur> but of course that does satisfy a win criteria

2010-09-12T13:06:57  <jmcarthur> deepblue: i think they are just thinking "hey i have spare ships. i should use them"
2010-09-12T13:06:57  <deepblue> it's only unneccesarly binding ships in flight before they are really needed
2010-09-12T13:06:59  <caytchen> lulin probably needs to adjust his attack.. always 1 ship short of actually taking the planet hehe
2010-09-12T13:07:15  <deepblue> mmh
2010-09-12T13:07:17  <antimatroid> i think it's a waste
2010-09-12T13:07:33  <jmcarthur> deepblue: they could also be used to make the opponent focus time on the wrong thing, but i don't know whether that will be viable until i see some better bots anyway

2010-09-12T13:08:12  <deepblue> I'm looking forward to the bot that beats the crap out of mine :)
2010-09-12T13:08:13  <bartwe> jmcarthur: mine starts to use streams in response to attack/defense of others that also turn into streams
2010-09-12T13:08:26  <deepblue> yeah
2010-09-12T13:08:27  <deepblue> same here
2010-09-12T13:08:28  <jmcarthur> sure, but that's defensive
2010-09-12T13:08:33  <bartwe> i think streams are unavoidable if both sides keep escalating their forces to the same point
2010-09-12T13:08:40  <jmcarthur> i'd say that is optimal defense, suboptimal offense

2010-09-12T13:09:24  <bartwe> it is also a good way to make the growthrate the winning indicator

2010-09-12T13:11:19  <canihazbacon> so if i have a planet with 5 ships and want to send all 5 somewhere else
2010-09-12T13:11:23  <canihazbacon> is that possible?
2010-09-12T13:11:30  <canihazbacon> or does one ship have to stay?
2010-09-12T13:11:31  <deepblue> canihazbacon
2010-09-12T13:11:32  <jmcarthur> canihazbacon: yes
2010-09-12T13:11:33  <deepblue> sure
2010-09-12T13:11:36  <deepblue> you can send all 5
2010-09-12T13:11:42  <jmcarthur> canihazbacon: you still own a planet with 0 ships
2010-09-12T13:11:42  <deepblue> and the planet will still be yours :)

2010-09-12T13:12:26  <jmcarthur> i guess i should go ahead and start that patch to put that on the main site

2010-09-12T13:12:59  <canihazbacon> thx for the spec!
2010-09-12T13:13:03  <rwa> in my bot the streaming is sort of emergent behavior.  I'm not quite sure why it does it, but it's satisfying my criteria for a good move somehow.

2010-09-12T13:14:33  <retybok> It seems graph representations could be useful for this game. Anyone using them?

2010-09-12T13:15:16  <jmcarthur> retybok: probably most bots are treating it as a graph, even if not explicitly

2010-09-12T13:15:32  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-12T13:15:50  <jmcarthur> most bots are probably precomputing the distances as some sort of adjacency matrix already
2010-09-12T13:15:54  <jmcarthur> or will be, anyway
2010-09-12T13:15:58  <retybok> :)
2010-09-12T13:16:26  <AJC> jmcarthur, a fully connected matrix isn't really a graph though :-)
2010-09-12T13:16:26  <rwa> deepblue: tell me how I did it when you figure it out...

2010-09-12T13:17:53  <AJC> if it's fully connected it makes no sense to think of it as a graph
2010-09-12T13:18:08  <retybok> it's still a graph if it's fully connected, even if it's not really useful to see it as a graph then :)
2010-09-12T13:18:10  <antimatroid> seriously, someone was saying yesterday about pointers
2010-09-12T13:18:17  <jmcarthur> AJC: yeah, that's why i said "even if not explicitly" a graph
2010-09-12T13:18:22  <jmcarthur> AJC: but it's still technically a graph

2010-09-12T13:19:59  <rwa> "graph algorithm" is just a point of view, really
2010-09-12T13:20:08  <antimatroid> DAE keep watching a game thinking you're a completely different colour to what you are?

2010-09-12T13:20:45  <jmcarthur> rwa: indeed. most (all?) algorithms are kind of graph algorithms "in disguise" i guess
2010-09-12T13:20:58  <retybok> *point of view
2010-09-12T13:21:10  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yes!
2010-09-12T13:21:26  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i especially get confused when watching somebody like deepblue who has a color in his name
2010-09-12T13:21:32  <retybok> antimatroid: especially when 'deepblue' is in red :)
2010-09-12T13:21:37  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-12T13:21:39  <retybok> :)
2010-09-12T13:21:40  <rwa> would be nice if the protagonist was always blue or red
2010-09-12T13:21:40  <antimatroid> haha
2010-09-12T13:21:46  <deepblue> hehe
2010-09-12T13:22:00  <antimatroid> could just assign each username a different colour?
2010-09-12T13:22:16  <antimatroid> then split conflicts with different colours to what either is used to
2010-09-12T13:22:23  <rwa> antimatroid: wouldn't work when blue played blue, for example
2010-09-12T13:22:29  <antimatroid> ^^
2010-09-12T13:22:39  <jmcarthur> do you guys think i should integrate the spec into the problem description page or should it be a separate page?
2010-09-12T13:22:41  <caytchen> that canvas thing generally could be beefed up..
2010-09-12T13:22:56  <bartwe> hmz, color from username hash
2010-09-12T13:22:57  <antimatroid> the canvas thing is awesome
2010-09-12T13:22:59  <drewrobb> make the protagonist the player who's profile you clicked from?
2010-09-12T13:23:04  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yeah, a hash-generated color would be nice
2010-09-12T13:23:16  <rwa> drewrobb:  right
2010-09-12T13:23:25  <jmcarthur> that could work
2010-09-12T13:23:26  <bartwe> hashcolor can also turn out horrible
2010-09-12T13:23:33  <jmcarthur> bartwe: you just have to be smart
2010-09-12T13:23:57  <deepblue> please tweak the has that way that I get blue :D
2010-09-12T13:24:08  <drewrobb> or have "home" and "away" colors for each player

2010-09-12T13:26:23  <antimatroid> i'm using tcp atm, i will set up something like that at some point
2010-09-12T13:26:51  <antimatroid> i might upload my current one to official site and leave it at that for the night

2010-09-12T13:50:40  <elijahbal> Are you sure your architecture is not at 100% of cpu
2010-09-12T13:50:41  <AJC> hmm, I guess I can just compile the .c file and it should work..
2010-09-12T13:51:04  <rwa> elijahbal: you mean the server?
2010-09-12T13:51:07  <elijahbal> yes
2010-09-12T13:51:11  <Cyndre> you read like 700 words a minute?
2010-09-12T13:51:22  <rwa> I'm nearly certain it is
2010-09-12T13:51:23  <elijahbal> what kind of hardware have you to keep running 1400 bot ?
2010-09-12T13:51:39  <rwa> elijahbal: not nearly enough yet
2010-09-12T13:51:55  <elijahbal> do you plan to make a distributed architecture ?
2010-09-12T13:52:15  <elijahbal> Well, add two-three servers could help I think.
2010-09-12T13:52:38  <rwa> there is some talk of that, but nothing concrete so far as I know
2010-09-12T13:52:57  <rwa> all my info is 2nd and 3rd hand from asking similar q's
2010-09-12T13:52:58  <elijahbal> my bot was submited more than 1h ago
2010-09-12T13:53:06  <Cyndre> should just make a package that works like the tcp server and runs the bot in a limited environment
2010-09-12T13:53:07  <elijahbal> and no news
2010-09-12T13:53:28  <rwa> elijahbal:  I'm having the same problem.  Something has gone wrong with submission IMO.  Even when the server was slammed, it was compiling them within 10 minutes.

2010-09-12T13:54:22  <bobng> you need to stop the contest and address scaling issues
2010-09-12T13:54:46  <bobng> it wouldn't be hard to write some kind of distributed architecture using python
2010-09-12T13:54:55  <elijahbal> the number of participant has been multiplied by 2 in 24h
2010-09-12T13:54:57  <Cyndre> then I can see your bots source?
2010-09-12T13:54:59  <elijahbal> yes indeed.
2010-09-12T13:55:02  <AJC> bobng, stopping the contest wouldn't do much.  people would still be coding :-)

2010-09-12T13:55:16  <elijahbal> bobng: you're right
2010-09-12T13:55:21  <bobng> yes, but the site obviously doesn't scale at the moment
2010-09-12T13:55:24  <Cyndre> they need to remove the bottleneck which is the cpu time for bots and offload it to us
2010-09-12T13:55:34  <bobng> keeping it running and causing downtime will only drive people away
2010-09-12T13:55:42  <Cyndre> just run it like the tcp server
2010-09-12T13:55:44  <elijahbal> I dont know what is the bottleneck
2010-09-12T13:55:53  <AJC> bobng, the online rankings are for informational purposes.  there are other ways to test it...
2010-09-12T13:56:07  <elijahbal> just advertise on the upload code that you are overloaded would be fine.
2010-09-12T13:56:09  <bobng> so what AJC?
2010-09-12T13:56:10  <Cyndre> elijahbal: 1 cpu at google, each bot fighting another bot for upto 200 turns? 3 mins and using a ton of cpu

2010-09-12T13:57:09  <Cyndre> bobng: the site scale fines, running the games doesn't
2010-09-12T13:57:11  <elijahbal> 400 turns = 400 s if you are at the limit
2010-09-12T13:57:12  <AJC> bobng, the site or the bot evaluations?
2010-09-12T13:57:22  <bobng> I define the site as the frontend and the backend
2010-09-12T13:57:27  <elijahbal> 3mn= 200s. I dont think the majority of bots are so slow
2010-09-12T13:57:51  <elijahbal> for a google sponsored game, we could expect something better.
2010-09-12T13:57:55  <bobng> I've had some mysql connection issues while using the site to do with too many connections
2010-09-12T13:58:05  <elijahbal> Google could lend us many computers I think
2010-09-12T13:58:13  <bobng> so I guess thats not scaling too well, but the backend is the issue.
2010-09-12T13:58:20  <AJC> bobng, it's open source.  simple html caching could fix the front-end.
2010-09-12T13:58:52  <bobng> So shut down the site, say you have had lots of feedback and are working hard to improve the backend to streamline the submission, compiling and test systems

2010-09-12T13:59:22  <AJC> bobng, yeah, shutting down the backend seems sensible if it's that bad. i've not noticed any problems.
2010-09-12T13:59:38  <Cyndre> or chage it so the bots are treated as a plugin for a common remote client that handles the bots like the tcp server

2010-09-12T14:00:34  <bobng> keep the current architecture, just create a way to make it distributed and then distribute it across trusted servers. I could supply a vps or two.
2010-09-12T14:00:46  <Cyndre> and the only argument against it is peole cheating so far - and if they cheat and use to much resources or play it themselves it will fail when the final testing begins
2010-09-12T14:00:58  <Cyndre> and then not participate in the contest bobng?
2010-09-12T14:01:10  <Cyndre> and the only one that will be harmed will be them
2010-09-12T14:01:42  <bobng> I would still participate, the vps would be donated and not used by me.
2010-09-12T14:01:48  <canihazbacon> ^^
2010-09-12T14:02:04  <Cyndre> would love to find what amstand was posting - if you donate server time you cant competre
2010-09-12T14:02:14  <Cyndre> already planning it all out bobng
2010-09-12T14:02:14  <antimatroid> ah crud, i didn't meant that 1. increment on my username
2010-09-12T14:02:25  <antimatroid> oh well
2010-09-12T14:02:28  <bobng> I might sketch out some code later
2010-09-12T14:02:30  <canihazbacon> :D
2010-09-12T14:02:35  <bobng> twisted.spread seems perfect for this.
2010-09-12T14:02:36  <Cyndre> bobng: its already coded
2010-09-12T14:02:52  <bobng> Cyndre: a distributed backend?
2010-09-12T14:02:53  <Cyndre> bobng: they are working on the rules for donating a server to run part of it
2010-09-12T14:03:05  <Cyndre> bobng: regretably yes
2010-09-12T14:03:26  <bobng> Hmm I didn't see that in the svn
2010-09-12T14:04:04  <Cyndre> its on the server side sandboxing stuff
2010-09-12T14:04:30  <Cyndre> but in my eyes thats not solving the problem as well as the tcp server does
2010-09-12T14:05:47  <Cyndre> nusers using x servers to simulate games     (distributed system attacking with hardware)    nusers using nusers_Comp to connected to remote server and run games    (removes constraints on cpu for simulating games)
2010-09-12T14:05:50  <dmj111> a1k0n:  :) I cannot resubmit ... mine needs a lot of work.  maybe i should just to quit screwing up the rankings (from the lucky draw to start with)
2010-09-12T14:05:54  <AJC> Cyndre, the TCP server is cool to get an idea of what's going on without actually submitting :-)
2010-09-12T14:06:36  <Cyndre> AJC: now imagine if the package was improved and auth added to it
2010-09-12T14:07:19  <AJC> Cyndre, I haven't tried it yet.  what do you need auth for?  make sure someone doesn't steal your nick?

2010-09-12T14:07:26  <Cyndre> AJC: instead of wasting time attacking an exponential scalling problem with linear solutions why not remove the exponential problem

2010-09-12T14:08:19  <Cyndre> maaxed
2010-09-12T14:08:35  <dmj111> yeah, I'm just enjoying the notoriety while it lasts.  Plus, if I don't resubmit, I am less tempted to spam the server.
2010-09-12T14:08:40  <bobng> I noticed this: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/experimental/python_subprocess_cpu_time/master.py
2010-09-12T14:08:51  <bobng> it looks like a horrible way to do it. forking is not a good way.
2010-09-12T14:08:53  <jmcarthur> dang, i'm gonna have to do some new css to get the spec to look right on the site
2010-09-12T14:09:05  <dmj111> the reason my bot is still on the tcp server is just because i know it is more fun to have more that 5 bots active over there.

2010-09-12T14:10:20  <AJC> Cyndre, so as part of the contest entry, you'd be required to run your bot a couple hundred times from your own machine?
2010-09-12T14:10:41  <Cyndre> AJC: Start a program and leave it running to help build stats - you need x games to qualifyh
2010-09-12T14:11:49  <Cyndre> AJC: and then the final results are done on googles main machine
2010-09-12T14:12:56  <Cyndre> AJC: 300 bots /1 comp(maybe running 5 games) for 30 games every 2 mins or so - or 300 bots connecting in like a mmorpg player and running 150 games every 2 mins
2010-09-12T14:13:15  <dhartmei> or require personal identification so programs can be run on bare metal, trusting the programmers
2010-09-12T14:13:20  <bobng> the average game time is 3 mins?
2010-09-12T14:13:25  <bobng> thats quite a lot...
2010-09-12T14:13:32  <Cyndre> max turns
2010-09-12T14:13:40  <Cyndre> is the limiting factor there
2010-09-12T14:13:47  <a1k0n> if each bot takes 1 second per turn and it lasts 200 turns, yes.  so far bots have been much faster than that
2010-09-12T14:14:08  <bobng> No bot should take a second of CPU time a turn
2010-09-12T14:14:22  <AJC> bobng, those are the rules.
2010-09-12T14:14:36  <a1k0n> with tron the smallest maps were 15*15 so there were always 200 turns and the bots that were any good used their whole second to search the game tree
2010-09-12T14:14:42  <Cyndre> AJC: exactly - build the system around the rules, not the rules around the system
2010-09-12T14:15:14  <a1k0n> (well, more like 150 squares were open but still)
2010-09-12T14:15:15  <Cyndre> aik0n: yea, when I started utilizing my time properly I went from 300's to to 100 - 200
2010-09-12T14:15:28  <AJC> Cyndre, 1s makes sense. either go for 30/60 turns per second, game like, or set it to something reasonably high -- like 1s :-)
2010-09-12T14:16:00  <dhartmei> or just run more games in parallel. less cpu cycles/second, but the rules are still fullfilled...
2010-09-12T14:16:25  <Cyndre> dhartmei: but then the games take 2000 seconds instead of 200 and we run 10 times as many at once
2010-09-12T14:16:27  <a1k0n> yeah, that ended up happening last time and kinda degraded the effectiveness of a lot of the bots
2010-09-12T14:16:37  <dhartmei> real time, not cpu time
2010-09-12T14:17:11  <Cyndre> like I said - next step should be defining environment bot is placed in
2010-09-12T14:17:26  <Cyndre> you get this much cpu and this much ram
2010-09-12T14:17:40  <dhartmei> so, if you have 500 programs, how many games per minute do you have to do to make them happy? then calculate backwards :)
2010-09-12T14:18:01  <dhartmei> one game every 10 minutes makes everyone happy?
2010-09-12T14:18:08  <bobng> You are prematurely optimizing tbh
2010-09-12T14:18:10  <Cyndre> thats designing to fail though - what happens at 1000 programs?
2010-09-12T14:18:15  <dhartmei> one game per program, that is
2010-09-12T14:18:24  <a1k0n> most likely, though once you have 100 games or so the returns diminish
2010-09-12T14:18:58  <dhartmei> i didn't know (last time) that everything was done on a single PC-type server
2010-09-12T14:19:04  <bobng> As I see it each game has 3 processes - a manager and two competitors?
2010-09-12T14:19:08  <bobng> is that correct?
2010-09-12T14:19:11  <Cyndre> yes
2010-09-12T14:19:17  <a1k0n> i thought they had a couple last time
2010-09-12T14:19:22  <a1k0n> at any rate it was an 8-core xeon
2010-09-12T14:19:23  <Cyndre> server and 2 clients
2010-09-12T14:19:30  <bobng> So why not reduce the number of managers.
2010-09-12T14:19:38  <Cyndre> bobng: because then you get less games
2010-09-12T14:19:40  <bobng> You can do that without reducing the number of clients
2010-09-12T14:19:54  <Cyndre> bobng: the problem is you only get x games/10 minutes no matter how you arrange things
2010-09-12T14:19:54  <greghaynes> Is it a comparable maching to the 8-core xeon this year?
2010-09-12T14:19:55  <a1k0n> in other words, use benzedrine.cx's server as the tournament server
2010-09-12T14:19:57  <dhartmei> move the database and web server onto a different server, then check performance again, that's what i would do
2010-09-12T14:19:59  <Cyndre> no
2010-09-12T14:20:07  <Cyndre> thats what Im pusshing for
2010-09-12T14:20:27  <a1k0n> no, but like, the clients run on their end, they are just managed by a single server which hosts the games
2010-09-12T14:20:39  <Cyndre> yes
2010-09-12T14:20:40  <a1k0n> i don't know how much overhead the engine is though in comparison to everything else
2010-09-12T14:20:42  <dhartmei> if the database read queries and web server are slow, that's not as bad if there's still games being played
2010-09-12T14:20:48  <greghaynes> The db and web server should really be on another server reguardless
2010-09-12T14:20:56  <a1k0n> greghaynes: yes indeed
2010-09-12T14:21:14  <bobng> Why not use python's twisted library to manage the clients. Twisted has asynchronous stdout packagers that might be very useful in a situation like this. You could spawn one manager and have it handle as many client pairs as you like
2010-09-12T14:21:28  <bobng> Would easily handle the timeout as well
2010-09-12T14:21:43  <a1k0n> bobng: sure, or just use the server dhartmei already built which does all that
2010-09-12T14:21:48  <Cyndre> bobng: organizers are against us running our own client
2010-09-12T14:21:56  <bobng> So then why do you need 1 server per 2 clients
2010-09-12T14:22:03  <a1k0n> bobng: at any rate, it decreses some of the overhead but not much compared to clients that (in theory) use one CPU-second per turn
2010-09-12T14:22:16  <bobng> Worst case scenario.
2010-09-12T14:22:41  <bobng> Make the manager time the average time taken per turn and submit into a db
2010-09-12T14:22:50  <Cyndre> and that solves another issue - multiple bot submitting
2010-09-12T14:23:01  <Cyndre> because I handle the cpu time used by my bots I could run 30 if I wanted
2010-09-12T14:23:03  <a1k0n> so you get more games if your bot is faster or what?
2010-09-12T14:23:07  <bobng> bots that consistently use a lot of CPU time can have a reduced number of games
2010-09-12T14:23:16  <bobng> I mean use a *lot* of CPU time
2010-09-12T14:23:31  <bobng> You could also make some interesting stats using that data
2010-09-12T14:23:39  <a1k0n> what if you use 1 CPU-second per turn, but trounce every opponent in like 30 turns
2010-09-12T14:23:52  <bobng> a1k0n: then take that into account
2010-09-12T14:24:03  <greghaynes> heh, fear complexity
2010-09-12T14:24:03  <Cyndre> vs my bot that uses 100 ms per turn and wins after 300 turns
2010-09-12T14:24:07  <bobng> bots that use a lot of CPU, loose all the time or take a long time to win

2010-09-12T14:24:48  <bobng> you could even email the owner asking him to optimize his code a bit.

2010-09-12T14:25:07  <Cyndre> bobng: whats the point of rules if they get changed after they have been put out?
2010-09-12T14:25:08  <hamstah> bobng, wanna ban loosy code?
2010-09-12T14:25:11  <greghaynes> Is the server box much weaker than last years?
2010-09-12T14:25:22  <Cyndre> bobng: we could also limit the bots to 10ms per turn and that would solve every problem
2010-09-12T14:25:24  <bobng> hamstah: not ban, just try and avoid it.

2010-09-12T14:25:52  <bobng> You guys are fitting all of your assumptions around the worst case scenario of each bot using 1 second per turn

2010-09-12T14:26:31  <antimatroid> AJC: not necessarily

2010-09-12T14:26:44  <a1k0n> it may make sense to just make the rule 100ms instead
2010-09-12T14:26:57  <hamstah> 100ms instead of 1s?
2010-09-12T14:26:59  <a1k0n> greghaynes: someone willing to do that, and willing to be disqualified
2010-09-12T14:26:59  <canihazbacon> google is sponsoring the contest, so why not ask them to provide free google app-engine ressources?
2010-09-12T14:27:04  <bobng> You are telling me that you expect to have a responsive server that can handle a lot of games when each game is going to take a second per turn
2010-09-12T14:27:08  <antimatroid> jesus, that's a big reduction
2010-09-12T14:27:10  <Cyndre> bobng: no, its called designing the system around the rules - MaxTurnTime = 1, MaxTurns = 200, MaxTime = MaxTurnTime * MaxTurns
2010-09-12T14:27:13  <antimatroid> at least 0.25 would be nice
2010-09-12T14:27:16  <hamstah> antimatroid, exactly
2010-09-12T14:27:31  <bobng> you can't have it all. either lower the turn limit or penalize the people who use a lot of CPU

2010-09-12T14:27:39  <bobng> or scale up your hardware.
2010-09-12T14:27:44  <antimatroid> i have a better solution
2010-09-12T14:27:49  <a1k0n> nobody actually running the contest is here
2010-09-12T14:27:56  <antimatroid> run the final tournament for however long it takes with a live updating scoreboard

2010-09-12T14:28:25  <antimatroid> and top 50 round robin to top it off
2010-09-12T14:28:34  <greghaynes> Maybe sabotoge my bot
2010-09-12T14:28:42  <dolphin278> can somebody share tcp server plug built for Win?
2010-09-12T14:28:45  <Cyndre> ggreghaynes: which only makes the problem somewhat go away
2010-09-12T14:28:47  <td> Anyone here using C# that could answer a few questions? :D
2010-09-12T14:28:54  <bobng> In any case collecting CPU usage info for each bot would be interesting for data mining purposes
2010-09-12T14:29:14  <Cyndre> greghaynes, now if everyone had client that connects to a central server the problem is gone - how many games is the tcp server handling vs the contest server?

2010-09-12T14:29:37  <Cyndre> greghaynes, like?
2010-09-12T14:29:50  <dolphin278> network issues, first of all

2010-09-12T14:30:17  <greghaynes> People with shoddy connections are also dq'd
2010-09-12T14:30:17  <dolphin278> if you don't have stable bandwidth - you're out
2010-09-12T14:30:18  <a1k0n> it is, up to some large constant factor
2010-09-12T14:30:21  <Cyndre> greghaynes: time limit is hadled via the program you download
2010-09-12T14:30:24  <dhartmei> if you have 8 cores, and you want to provide cpu cycles equal to what the programmers have at home, it follows you can only run 8 games every 200 seconds, that's 1 game per minute. now you have 500 participants. how long is the average time between games of one participant?
2010-09-12T14:30:44  <dhartmei> just not enough :)
2010-09-12T14:30:53  <a1k0n> dhartmei: 4 games every 200 seconds
2010-09-12T14:30:56  <Cyndre> greghaynes: ping running in background and ping time added in (if you change the program your side to cheat you will just lose durring finals and be replaced by next in list)
2010-09-12T14:30:58  <dhartmei> right
2010-09-12T14:31:26  <Cyndre> and then I can solve the problem for $20 a month by getting a dedicated server online as well
2010-09-12T14:31:31  <greghaynes> People who live across continents from the box are very liable to have massive lag spikes
2010-09-12T14:31:59  <Cyndre> greghaynes: it doesn't matter because you can run games after they are finished and the timeout is handled client side
2010-09-12T14:32:17  <greghaynes> Yea, but your ping precision is > 1 sec
2010-09-12T14:32:31  <Cyndre> but the client enforces timeout, the ping time is leniency
2010-09-12T14:32:49  <Cyndre> if your running 150 games wasting 2 secs a turn doesnt matter
2010-09-12T14:33:05  <greghaynes> Ah, thats pretty easy to circumvent, and that would also require a closed source client
2010-09-12T14:33:11  <Cyndre> like I said
2010-09-12T14:33:20  <Cyndre> if they circumvent it looks good going into finals
2010-09-12T14:33:31  <Cyndre> then fails miserably - the next person in line is moved up and they are dqed
2010-09-12T14:33:40  <greghaynes> I would not be too happy with needing to run a closed source client
2010-09-12T14:33:47  <Cyndre> closed source client?
2010-09-12T14:33:52  <Cyndre> why would it be closed source?
2010-09-12T14:34:07  <greghaynes> Well, if its open source circumventing is hilariously trivial for anyone who can program
2010-09-12T14:34:12  <ermau> Making it closed source wouldn't really help that much anyway, just an annoyance
2010-09-12T14:34:22  <greghaynes> ermau: Yea, its all you can do though
2010-09-12T14:34:24  <AJC> greghaynes, you mean some kind of phylosophical complaint with closed source?  here it would make entirely sense.
2010-09-12T14:34:24  <Cyndre> greghaynes: that doesnt give them any advantage in the finals which is what counts
2010-09-12T14:34:54  <Cyndre> greghaynes: in fact screwing with the software to make their bot better would pretty much guarentee dq when finals start

2010-09-12T14:35:49  <greghaynes> What about people who are using 1sec cpu at home on a more powerful box than the server for finals?
2010-09-12T14:36:05  <Cyndre> the client sandbox's the bot and only gives it x ram and x cpu
2010-09-12T14:36:14  <Cyndre> guarenteed to run on final box
2010-09-12T14:36:24  <greghaynes> AJC: Thats one reason, its also a security issue among other things
2010-09-12T14:36:26  <dhartmei> provide some benchmark code so people can _voluntarily_ synchronize, only run the finals on internal servers?
2010-09-12T14:36:34  <Cyndre> exactly
2010-09-12T14:36:37  <DirtyKeyboard> greghaynes: your program should check the time periodically if you're worried about this
2010-09-12T14:36:42  <dhartmei> allow people to cheat during pre-finals, they only deceive themselves
2010-09-12T14:36:46  <Cyndre> yes
2010-09-12T14:36:50  <Cyndre> dhartmei gets it
2010-09-12T14:37:00  <greghaynes> eek, coding a sandbox for all platforms would be a fairly difficult task
2010-09-12T14:37:04  <greghaynes> DirtyKeyboard: Good point
2010-09-12T14:37:12  <dhartmei> no, the sandbox is only on the internal servers
2010-09-12T14:37:27  <Cyndre> well I would want a client that limits the bots ram and cpu time for benchmarking
2010-09-12T14:37:27  <dhartmei> people don't need to sandbox their own code
2010-09-12T14:37:40  <Cyndre> I would want to limit the avaliable resources to that of the final sandbox
2010-09-12T14:37:41  <dhartmei> exactly, voluntarily, so you measure with equal sticks
2010-09-12T14:37:54  <AJC> anyone have problems with tcp.c?  execv: python ../python_starter_package/MyBot.py: failed
2010-09-12T14:38:10  <Cyndre> chmod +x MyBot.py ?
2010-09-12T14:38:12  <dhartmei> make a wrapper shell script
2010-09-12T14:38:23  <dhartmei> the execv argument must be a single file name
2010-09-12T14:38:36  <AJC> dhartmei, ah.  and with the full path?
2010-09-12T14:38:49  <dhartmei> relative path is ok
2010-09-12T14:38:58  <greghaynes> relative works, just give it something you can ./
2010-09-12T14:39:00  <DirtyKeyboard> AJC: make sure the python file is executable and the first line is this: #!/usr/bin/env python

2010-09-12T14:40:16  <greghaynes> Given that we have a 1s limit for this game the idea seems to be that you dont really have a hard time limit, just dont use up all the time in the world
2010-09-12T14:40:23  <AJC> DirtyKeyboard, greghaynes, Cyndre thanks.
2010-09-12T14:41:01  <Cyndre> greghaynes: true, but as a backend designer the system should expect people to use every second of time
2010-09-12T14:41:03  <greghaynes> Which is a big reason the tcp server/client system would work
2010-09-12T14:41:08  <greghaynes> Yea
2010-09-12T14:41:40  <Cyndre> and then with 3 servers they can simulate identical conditions to run finals in, except clients are trusted
2010-09-12T14:41:51  <greghaynes> Someone should really add at least a little authentication to that thing ;)
2010-09-12T14:42:01  <bobng> the tcp server/client system would not benefit those who cannot leave their systems on 24/7 to compete.
2010-09-12T14:42:18  <Cyndre> I was thinking a private key generated on download and inserted into directory
2010-09-12T14:42:34  <Cyndre> bobng: if you run your home comp for 1h you get 20 games at 3 minutes a game
2010-09-12T14:42:44  <Cyndre> bobng: I got 10 games in 20 hours yesterday
2010-09-12T14:43:12  <greghaynes> Maybe the official contest runners could just be a client that accepts uploads and runs games periodicly for each person uploading
2010-09-12T14:43:13  <Cyndre> bobng: and it would - within 10 minutes you could start work on your next bot after watching it perform in realtime
2010-09-12T14:43:39  <greghaynes> They would lose a ton of their load because many with faster machines would want to run at home to get more games in
2010-09-12T14:43:45  <Cyndre> bobng: currently my uploaded bot broke top 100 but I have no idea what version it even is now
2010-09-12T14:43:48  <DirtyKeyboard> So, I don't really like ShowGame.jar, does anyone have a better alternative?
2010-09-12T14:44:20  <AJC> ulope, did you try your python bots on the TCP server?  apparently hamstah says the default bot issues invalid orders...
2010-09-12T14:44:22  <Cyndre> dhartmei: any chance of working on a client for yours that can browse for a file, open it, play it etc and visualize in rt?
2010-09-12T14:45:14  <greghaynes> Wow, now that im actually getting to play some games my rank went way up :)
2010-09-12T14:45:19  <dhartmei> would be os dependant, no?
2010-09-12T14:45:32  <greghaynes> dhartmei: Use Qt :)
2010-09-12T14:45:33  <jmcarthur> developers, review this patch please http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=135
2010-09-12T14:45:58  <Cyndre> dhartmei: even a windows client that they can easily add a bot and test with it repeatedly  (a exe file they can just run)  <- would probably help alot with amount of bots
2010-09-12T14:46:25  <bobng> I'm working on a windows version of the tcp server client
2010-09-12T14:46:41  <Cyndre> are you going to make it graphical or cml?
2010-09-12T14:46:44  <dhartmei> last time someone posted one to the forums (not graphical, though, iirc), myself i don't even have a windows box... :)
2010-09-12T14:46:44  <greghaynes> If you want me to make a Qt dialog for that I can, will take all of 2 seconds

2010-09-12T14:50:41  <greghaynes> Its a widget toolkit, in linux land everything is either Gtk or Qt (besides some others rarely used)
2010-09-12T14:50:57  <greghaynes> Qt has the advantage of also working on the major other OS's
2010-09-12T14:51:01  <Cyndre> okay, so you could make like a bot loader, runner, game visualizer for the tcp server?

2010-09-12T14:52:37  <Cyndre> not sure on that myself - jmcarthur?
2010-09-12T14:52:49  <greghaynes> Interesting, gtk on win works just seems a little scary
2010-09-12T14:53:02  <jmcarthur> mietek: it is. it must work with ghc 6.8.2, and your main must be called MyBot.hs
2010-09-12T14:53:05  <Cyndre> stick with what your comfortable with
2010-09-12T14:53:20  <mietek> 6.8.2, oh my.
2010-09-12T14:53:24  <jmcarthur> yeah i know...
2010-09-12T14:53:38  <jmcarthur> i tried to get a newer version working, but ubuntu 8.04 just won't take to it :\
2010-09-12T14:53:59  <jmcarthur> if we get our sandboxes fixed up we might be able to just do arbitrary binaries though
2010-09-12T14:54:11  <jmcarthur> i'm pushing for that, but i don't know if it will work

2010-09-12T14:55:42  <Palmik> jmcarthur, would not it be easier to persuade them to update to newer version of ubuntu?

2010-09-12T14:56:09  <Cyndre> would have to be a fresh install
2010-09-12T14:56:13  <jmcarthur> Palmik: we might have to go to a distributed architecture for the bots anyway, and we could do newer stuff then

2010-09-12T14:59:21  <jmcarthur> the guy that started arch came from slackware

2010-09-12T15:01:12  <Cyndre> but yea I need to work on my bot :)   - it now abandons when theres no chance of reinforcements reaching in time, or not enough reinforcements
2010-09-12T15:01:21  <Palmik> Or I could ninja swap their OSes :D

2010-09-12T15:03:59  <javagamer_Cpp> One of my friends did it to his parents, it took a while before one noticed, and he noticed b/c it was working smoother
2010-09-12T15:04:02  <Cyndre> people are so dumb - it could be an entirely new process but if you ensure them thats how they always did it before......
2010-09-12T15:04:03  <Palmik> They might notice the speed up :P
2010-09-12T15:04:32  <javagamer_Cpp> His parents made him change it back, but after a day or two, they had him switch it to Linux again
2010-09-12T15:04:51  <Palmik> Also, solitaire is much nice here on my machine then the pixelated one on XP :D

2010-09-12T15:09:59  <troutwine> greghaynes: I did, for six years. Took a degree there and everything. I moved away to Rochester, NY in the past month.
2010-09-12T15:10:10  <Cyndre> see, google should give the aicontest 20 computers and donate to freegeek at the end of the contest

2010-09-12T15:11:31  <dwchandler> maybe someone should make a suggestion to Google
2010-09-12T15:11:52  <greghaynes> Im sure it has come up
2010-09-12T15:12:01  <greghaynes> There are a couple google competitors
2010-09-12T15:12:04  <dwchandler> sometimes these things don't happen because nobody in the right place thinks about it
2010-09-12T15:12:27  <javagamer_Cpp> Yeah, could be everyone's assumed someone else has mentioned it to them
2010-09-12T15:12:27  <dhartmei> don't just give them the email addresses for the recruiters, trade them for some nice hardware :)
2010-09-12T15:12:28  <Cyndre> Ill write a blog about how awsome the contest is, if it had the resources having a name like google behind it makes you think it would
2010-09-12T15:12:43  <dhartmei> amazon would have nice clusters for this, no?
2010-09-12T15:13:30  <greghaynes> Cyndre: Just keep in mind they could just as easily distance themselves from the contest if they think they are getting bad PR as a resuly
2010-09-12T15:13:41  <Cyndre> greghaynes: was thinking that myself to
2010-09-12T15:14:33  <dhartmei> google also has the technology to run untrusted i386 binary code natively, if you haven't read that paper. this would be an awesome showcase for it...
2010-09-12T15:14:43  <Cyndre> but really if all they are doing is providing a name and a computer I wouldnt give my kids to play on......
2010-09-12T15:15:00  <Cyndre> really?  thats an intresting blog post
2010-09-12T15:15:02  <greghaynes> Im not sure they are providing the computer...
2010-09-12T15:15:07  <Cyndre> problem + solution = win

2010-09-12T15:17:12  <Cyndre> along the lines of Google ai contest a win again.  More backend power.  Maybe if they used your article (courtesy of dhartmei or your real name if so inclined) was used it would be a win for both

2010-09-12T15:27:59  <deepblue> :)
2010-09-12T15:28:41  <Cyndre> deepblue: do you search for planets based on dist/growthRate/costToTakeOver
2010-09-12T15:29:12  <deepblue> well
2010-09-12T15:29:22  * deepblue deepblue just knows
2010-09-12T15:29:24  <deepblue> ;)
2010-09-12T15:29:36  <Cyndre> in that one, I see you send just enough ships to take planet x, and enough ships to take planet y with enough for planet z left over
2010-09-12T15:29:48  <RainCT> So, how can I use that TCP thing? The example bots suck big time
2010-09-12T15:29:53  <deepblue> pretty cool eh :)
2010-09-12T15:30:03  <greghaynes> Hes just turned the game into a modified version of chess
2010-09-12T15:30:16  <javagamer_Cpp> Pointers shouldn't move around on their own, right?
2010-09-12T15:30:37  <greghaynes> RainCT: Read the fine source
2010-09-12T15:30:38  <RainCT> btw, why are you guys sending around so many small fleets at once and to the same planet?
2010-09-12T15:30:39  <Cyndre> very - its like an iterative search for 5 planets with x planets within 3 distance or something
2010-09-12T15:30:44  <deepblue> I suck at chess btw, get to excited when things seem to work out and then I lose
2010-09-12T15:30:51  <bss03> RainCT: Can you beat RageBot all the time?  And DualBot?
2010-09-12T15:31:04  <bss03> RainCT: They actually perform fairly well in practice.
2010-09-12T15:31:11  <Cyndre> deepblue: am I close?
2010-09-12T15:31:24  <deepblue> kind of :)
2010-09-12T15:32:03  <RainCT> bss03: DualBot yes, haven't tried Rage. /me will try the "play 100 times against every example bot" script now
2010-09-12T15:32:31  <greghaynes> I saw an interestin trick by a couple people on the top, since everyone seeems to send numfleets + 1, some people are sending numfleets + 2
2010-09-12T15:32:36  <edcba> deepblue: saw this one where you lose against 1 ship : http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284317604|OminousBirthdayCake|deepblue-test ? :)
2010-09-12T15:33:13  <Vio> RainCT, try to improve your average turns then on every bot

2010-09-12T15:35:44  <Doctor> Is the tcp prog compiled for Windows available anywhere?  I really don't want to have to download and install gcc/Cygwin/etc :-)
2010-09-12T15:36:09  <Cyndre> need to make that easier and more accessable
2010-09-12T15:36:15  <DirtyKeyboard> Doctor: use a better OS. :P I kid, I kid
2010-09-12T15:36:18  <Cyndre> then I wont lose so much on the tcp server
2010-09-12T15:36:33  <greghaynes> yea yea. im working on a qt client as we speak
2010-09-12T15:36:40  <Cyndre> cool
2010-09-12T15:36:47  <Doctor> Well, VMS stopped booting on this machine.

2010-09-12T15:37:11  <DirtyKeyboard> Doctor: I haven't tried that java client that's in that forum thread, have you tried that out?
2010-09-12T15:37:18  <Cyndre> see the reason my bot loses isnt that I suck at this, its that we dont have enuogh people with lower skills then me on the tcp server

2010-09-12T15:39:02  <Cyndre> I need to finish sending reinforcements, I think that will mke a huge difference
2010-09-12T15:39:04  <Doctor> DK: ty
2010-09-12T15:39:07  <RainCT> Just tried with the script to play 100 times against each example bots, and I've won all the games. The surprising thing is that I haven't even seriously started writing anything, I'm just indiscriminately conquering anything I can conquer sending the exact number of ships
2010-09-12T15:39:22  <ermau> RainCT: Yup
2010-09-12T15:39:25  <ermau> RainCT: Example bots suck
2010-09-12T15:39:41  <ermau> Hell, even put it on the real contest server, most of the bots running there suck too
2010-09-12T15:39:46  <DirtyKeyboard> RainCT: I have testing like that, but I put my old bot versions in there too. ;)
2010-09-12T15:39:48  <Cyndre> including that damn ragebot and dualbot?
2010-09-12T15:40:09  <RainCT> Cyndre: Yes
2010-09-12T15:40:15  <Cyndre> as I have been adding things I went from a 90% success to a 65% success
2010-09-12T15:40:19  <RainCT> DirtyKeyboard: That's a good idea, I guess I should do the same
2010-09-12T15:40:27  <amstan> so.. is the world burning yet?
2010-09-12T15:40:56  <Cyndre> but removed a bug that would reinforce any planet that was being attacked....
2010-09-12T15:41:49  <DirtyKeyboard> so do the contest managers have safeguards in place for when these bots get too smart and try to take over the world?

2010-09-12T15:47:02  <Cyndre> yay, http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284320318|cwbowron|Cyndre   reatreat is working good I see
2010-09-12T15:47:10  <caytchen> you can tell from its moves that its working really clean and concise.

2010-09-12T15:47:23  <elijahbal> cpu time is an arbitrary measure.
2010-09-12T15:47:32  <elijahbal> why don't you count in cpu cycles ?
2010-09-12T15:47:48  <amstan> contestbot: later tell j3camero mysql is erroring that there's too many connections, java bots returned
2010-09-12T15:47:48  <contestbot> amstan: The operation succeeded.
2010-09-12T15:48:05  <elijahbal> If you have any scheduler with 3-4 matches it doesnt seem the same than 1s in one match / one computer.
2010-09-12T15:48:10  <caytchen> Cyndre: lol, did you build some kind of flee heuristic? ;p
2010-09-12T15:48:13  <ermau> Cyndre: lol.. and I won against you
2010-09-12T15:48:38  <Cyndre> caytchen: yea - just on the part where it dispatch's reinforcements
2010-09-12T15:49:19  <Naktibalda> I want to fix some things in site? do I have to create issue and attach patch or is it possible to become commiter?
2010-09-12T15:49:29  <bss03> Cyndre: I want to see your Bot vs. Mine.
2010-09-12T15:49:31  <Cyndre> caytchen: so if absolutely no chance of saving planet (ships wont make in time or unavaliable it abandons said planet)
2010-09-12T15:49:44  <bss03> Cyndre: Since I never "cut off" fleets, I image it would take a while.
2010-09-12T15:49:44  <Cyndre> bss03: my bot sucks
2010-09-12T15:50:08  <Cyndre> bss03: nah, cause I will be constantly fleeing to neutral planets and weekening them for you
2010-09-12T15:50:15  <caytchen> that might not be optimal.. your enemy will start on that planet with much more ships than expected
2010-09-12T15:50:23  <bss03> Naktibalda: It is possible to become a developer.
2010-09-12T15:50:27  <albert> finally! i finished the standalone port of the game engine to c++
2010-09-12T15:50:41  <bss03> Naktibalda: j3camero is someone to talk to about it, there are probably others.
2010-09-12T15:50:44  <Doctor> so I tried the tcp client.  I get a few INFO lines and then nothing... is that expected?  (Does it take a while...?)
2010-09-12T15:50:44  <Cyndre> caytchen: but if the ships are lost? and its 10% of my fleet and 1% of his fleet?
2010-09-12T15:51:17  <ermau> Depends on if you can recover the planet quickly
2010-09-12T15:52:06  <Cyndre> ermau: it would seem my boss needs to take into account projected growth rate based on your dispatched ships as well (I was ahead so started attacking your planets, but then your ships landed and put you ahead)
2010-09-12T15:52:09  <Cyndre> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284320400|Cyndre|ermau-1.0
2010-09-12T15:52:34  <Cyndre> my bot - lolz at boss
2010-09-12T15:53:49  <ermau> Cyndre: The fact that you didn't go for the 8 ship large planet early is probably why you lost
2010-09-12T15:54:12  <caytchen> yeah you went for that massive 89..
2010-09-12T15:54:16  <ermau> Cyndre: I'd gained 45 ships from mine by the time you took yours
2010-09-12T15:54:25  <Doctor> Cyndre -- how are you getting the game_ids for games on the tcp server?
2010-09-12T15:54:41  <Cyndre> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getplayer?player=Cyndre
2010-09-12T15:54:47  <Doctor> ah thanks
2010-09-12T15:54:50  <Cyndre> but still I managed to catch up in production
2010-09-12T15:55:11  <Cyndre> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getratings
2010-09-12T15:55:13  <ermau> Yup
2010-09-12T15:55:22  <ermau> Like I said.. this bot has huge logic flaws
2010-09-12T15:55:32  <Cyndre> but then I gave it up
2010-09-12T15:56:00  <Cyndre> so now when Im ahaead Im going to make my bot do this > if ahead in growth rate attack neutral planets the enemy is sending ships to instead of enemy planets directly
2010-09-12T15:56:07  <ermau> For example, I could of captured a larger planet easier than the smaller one (turn 44, that 41 ship fleet)
2010-09-12T15:56:14  <ermau> Which is a double fail on prioritization
2010-09-12T15:57:01  <dstufft_> Naktibalda: you can create patches for the meantime, j3camero can add you as a comitter as well

2010-09-12T16:29:16  <rafsoaken> yup forums work
2010-09-12T16:29:22  <rogue780> retybok, at home I have 3 linux boxes. I'm away right now and just have my under-powered netbook
2010-09-12T16:29:23  <Utkarsh> you can compile tcp.c using cygwin. worked for me
2010-09-12T16:29:44  <Naktibalda> can someone review my patch? http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=137

2010-09-12T16:36:37  <retybok> rogue780: it should be very easy, just make sure you install gcc
2010-09-12T16:36:48  <rogue780> well I have a sever with over 20TB storage and even more bandwidth that allows more than 1040 mysql connections
2010-09-12T16:36:50  <retybok> (i mean select it when installing cygwin)
2010-09-12T16:36:55  <edcba> isn't tcp.c swappable by some netcat command ?
2010-09-12T16:36:59  <rogue780> and even more postres connections
2010-09-12T16:39:23  <javagamer_Cpp> Oh wow, for the first time ever I've beat dual bot.  Though I've really spent most of my time working on organizing data rather than actual logic.

2010-09-12T16:54:29  <evgenius> is there was, I would rather use it instead of C++

2010-09-12T16:55:28  <greghaynes> Someone please make a php bot, that would be hilarious
2010-09-12T16:55:35  <rogue780> Naktibalda, evgenius, why? Why not python or Java?
2010-09-12T16:55:39  <jmcarthur> if you know php why not just use python or ruby?

2010-09-12T16:55:51  <greghaynes> It exists?
2010-09-12T16:55:53  <jmcarthur> yes
2010-09-12T16:55:54  <greghaynes> Link?
2010-09-12T16:55:56  <evgenius> I don't know python or Java
2010-09-12T16:56:07  <dstufft_> sounds like a good time to learn python
2010-09-12T16:56:10  <rogue780> evgenius, this would be a great opportunity to learn
2010-09-12T16:56:24  <greghaynes> You know python, you just dont realize it yet
2010-09-12T16:56:26  <dstufft_> python is pretty great/easy tbh

2010-09-12T16:56:31  <evgenius> :)
2010-09-12T16:56:33  <dstufft_> it's almost psuedo code at times
2010-09-12T16:56:47  <rogue780> Naktibalda, have you submitted your bot?
2010-09-12T16:56:48  <Naktibalda> because I know PHP, I'm not interested in other top languages. if I write a bot in another language, it will be Lua
2010-09-12T16:56:50  <jmcarthur> eh, python is not psuedocode to me
2010-09-12T16:57:01  <greghaynes> Then use lua
2010-09-12T16:57:12  <Utkarsh> ruby > python :P

2010-09-12T16:57:30  <greghaynes> Yes, because python rules all
2010-09-12T16:57:32  <greghaynes> ;)
2010-09-12T16:57:36  <jmcarthur> they are basically the same, just with different syntactic philosophies
2010-09-12T16:57:42  <evgenius> well, when you learn a language, you spend a lot of time on simple problems. I'd rather get some results as quick as possible
2010-09-12T16:57:50  <amstan> one python to rule them all
2010-09-12T16:57:54  <jmcarthur> and the ruby community seems to like magic a little more
2010-09-12T16:57:55  <greghaynes> Actually, they are pretty opposite design IMO
2010-09-12T16:58:07  <Utkarsh> has ruby been added to the server yet?
2010-09-12T16:58:10  <Naktibalda> evgenius: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=104
2010-09-12T16:58:13  <jmcarthur> opposite along a certain dimension
2010-09-12T16:58:14  <Utkarsh> couldn't find a single ruby entry
2010-09-12T16:58:20  <jmcarthur> but along all others they are pretty much the same
2010-09-12T16:58:26  <greghaynes> ruby likes everything and the kitchen sink, python likes you having to import as much as possible
2010-09-12T16:58:28  <rogue780> evgenius, agreed. Although it seems to me that with c++, fast results is almost a never
2010-09-12T16:59:13  <dstufft_> ruby is convention over configuration, python is explicit over implicit
2010-09-12T16:59:34  <greghaynes> Well said
2010-09-12T16:59:39  <jmcarthur> that's the main difference in my book. all others are insignificant
2010-09-12T16:59:40  <retybok> For this challenge i think "slow" languages have a chance, computation time doesn't seem so important (since the problem is so overwhelming anyways)
2010-09-12T16:59:53  <greghaynes> Now to finish the qtcpcient...
2010-09-12T16:59:54  <jmcarthur> retybok: dunno about that. there are some computation heavy methods that still apply
2010-09-12T17:00:01  <rogue780> i've never tried ruby. I've wanted to, but it seems too gimicky to me. Kinda like java did back in the day (in my strange mind anyway)
2010-09-12T17:00:06  <retybok> of course running fast is always an advantage, but less so than for tron I believe
2010-09-12T17:00:38  <rogue780> Naktibalda, I'm really curious about your bot. I've never made a CLI app with python before. Have you submitted your bot yet?
2010-09-12T17:00:41  <pacotabaco> hi guys. What's the ip and port to test our bots with tcp.c? Can we use any username without passwd?
2010-09-12T17:00:42  <RainCT> bss03: Turns out the test script wasn't working correctly. I've tried again now and the results are pretty much the same, except for RageBot where I only got 18/100, and against stuff on TCP it also sucks (as I had expected)
2010-09-12T17:00:48  <caytchen> well with tron there were things like pathfinding, with this challenge everything that counts is basically lookahead and heuristics
2010-09-12T17:01:02  <RainCT> pacotabaco: 213.3.30.106, 9999, yes
2010-09-12T17:01:07  <pacotabaco> tnks
2010-09-12T17:01:17  <Naktibalda> rogue780: is it possible to submit a bot written in unsupported language?
2010-09-12T17:01:42  <Naktibalda> my bot is pretty dumb yet, I need some good strategy
2010-09-12T17:01:51  <rogue780> Naktibalda, I...I suppose not.

2010-09-12T17:03:15  <evgenius> Naktibalda: so, if I upload a PHP file, the server will understand how to run it? is PHP starter package enabled on server already?
2010-09-12T17:03:25  <Naktibalda> no
2010-09-12T17:03:43  <amstan> guys.. unless the starter packs are on the main website, your languages will not work
2010-09-12T17:03:44  <Naktibalda> they haven't added support for any new language yet
2010-09-12T17:03:48  <edcba> no Environment.NewLine, no CultureInfo.InvariantCulture...
2010-09-12T17:03:57  <edcba> doesn't look like c# program :)
2010-09-12T17:03:57  <amstan> we have much bigger issues than to add random languages
2010-09-12T17:04:08  <jmcarthur> except for haskell, but that's just because it happens to have been added for something i was testing earlier
2010-09-12T17:04:16  <greghaynes> What could be more important than allowing people to write AI's in php!?
2010-09-12T17:04:18  <canihazbacon> edcba: maybe this is due to the server using mono?
2010-09-12T17:05:12  <jmcarthur> anybody that wants to try their obscure technologies (i am among them) can do so with the tcp server
2010-09-12T17:05:13  <canihazbacon> greghaynes: after all php is an all-time ai devs favourite language... unlike kiddie stuff like lisp or haskell
2010-09-12T17:05:31  <canihazbacon> ;-)
2010-09-12T17:05:44  <greghaynes> Yes, everyone knows lisp was made for web hacks, whilst php was designed by phd's for AI
2010-09-12T17:05:44  <jmcarthur> of course, *eventually* other languages can be added

2010-09-12T17:06:25  <canihazbacon> question: any other python dev here that would be interested in writing a python port of the TCP client?
2010-09-12T17:06:27  <edcba> fix is to put         Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;
2010-09-12T17:06:32  <Naktibalda> evgenius: have you tried to run it against local bots?

2010-09-12T17:10:13  <canihazbacon> that was what i was suggesting

2010-09-12T17:10:52  <canihazbacon> that others might have problems with the code...

2010-09-12T17:14:29  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: basically
2010-09-12T17:14:40  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: it's not really in shape for public consumption
2010-09-12T17:14:57  <jmcarthur> and it works very differently from how most people might expect

2010-09-12T17:21:41  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: mine basically just spits out a [Either Planet Fleet] for you to use, and gives you an Order structure with an issueOrders :: [Order] -> IO () function
2010-09-12T17:21:49  <rogue780> caytchen, I had to stick "java Err"  in a .bat file
2010-09-12T17:21:54  <bartwe> mostly because other bots are down it seems ;p
2010-09-12T17:22:18  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: so maybe I'm better off writing my own
2010-09-12T17:22:22  <caytchen> rogue780: yeah seems execv doesn't like arbitrary command lines
2010-09-12T17:22:23  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: where Planet and Fleet are exactly the information in the file format
2010-09-12T17:22:38  <caytchen> but needs program and command line clearly seperated but tcp.c won't do that
2010-09-12T17:22:42  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: dunno about "better off". you'd have to write basically the same functionality and then whatever else you want on top of it
2010-09-12T17:22:50  <rogue780> so, does tcp give the same output as playgame so I can pipe it to showgame?
2010-09-12T17:23:14  <Naktibalda> you can watch game in site

2010-09-12T17:24:56  <caytchen> it only tracks tcp games

2010-09-12T17:25:09  <deepblue> and it takes a minute or so until your latest shows up
2010-09-12T17:25:10  <bartwe> yep, but not chains towards enemies, unles the enemy provokes it

2010-09-12T17:45:00  <rogue780> caytchen, cool bot at me, or someone else?
2010-09-12T17:45:05  <caytchen> you :o

2010-09-12T17:45:17  <rogue780> I can't beat dmj.4 though
2010-09-12T17:45:27  <dstufft_> apparently TM get's restarted quite frequently, though im not sure why
2010-09-12T17:45:50  <jmcarthur> they are just batch runners. i think they terminate on their own
2010-09-12T17:45:55  <jmcarthur> in normal operation
2010-09-12T17:46:18  <jmcarthur> but there are strange things happening right now...
2010-09-12T17:46:19  <dstufft_> jmcarthur: yea i know, but that assumes that they terminate on their own correctly
2010-09-12T17:46:24  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-12T17:46:34  <dstufft_> instead of having a master process that stays running
2010-09-12T17:46:37  <jmcarthur> the sandbox is completely screwed up anyway. maybe we should rewrite the TM
2010-09-12T17:46:39  <dstufft_> that can handle everything
2010-09-12T17:46:57  <jmcarthur> especially if we are thinking of doing this distributed thing
2010-09-12T17:46:57  <dstufft_> constantly firing up new tm's via cron seems very hackish to me
2010-09-12T17:47:01  <jmcarthur> agreed
2010-09-12T17:47:18  <jmcarthur> i'd rather than a single TM process and another process to watch it and restart it if necessary
2010-09-12T17:47:18  <dstufft_> i think it's done to reload data from mysql
2010-09-12T17:47:22  <jmcarthur> *rather have
2010-09-12T17:47:27  <danielvf> jmcarthur: I agree
2010-09-12T17:47:29  <jmcarthur> see, that's silly to me
2010-09-12T17:47:38  <dstufft_> but you can handle that by perodically rereshing
2010-09-12T17:47:44  <dstufft_> in the code itself
2010-09-12T17:47:46  <jmcarthur> it should just grab minimal data from mysql for each match
2010-09-12T17:47:51  <jmcarthur> rather than batch it up
2010-09-12T17:48:34  <jmcarthur> and if the next complaint is that you need all that data to process properly then we should be using a fancier database than mysql anyway

2010-09-12T17:59:47  <coventry> It took me a while to understand bartwe's strategy of chaining through a string of planets, but it's pretty clever.  It gives him more flexibility in re-routing.

2010-09-12T18:33:32  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  indeed, I hope things get sorted out.  end users aren't going to have this much info as to whats going on and why their bot only gets one game every X hours (if at all) - be good to get things rolling again
2010-09-12T18:33:47  <jmcarthur> yeah

2010-09-12T18:44:43  <jmcarthur> danielvf: most secure without a vm is probably to use ptrace to filter system calls. the problem is it kills the cpu, even makes the java entries pretty much useless.
2010-09-12T18:45:45  <jmcarthur> wouldn't be a huge problem if we are willing to run fewer matches for longer periods of time (longer time limits)
2010-09-12T18:45:49  <jmcarthur> but that might suck

2010-09-12T18:49:35  <PabloM> hi
2010-09-12T18:51:37  <PabloM> I'm having troubles running the simulations, sometimes for no aparent reason the game ends with a completly different state that the previous turn... Is anyone having this problem?
2010-09-12T18:52:01  <jmreardon> PabloM: as in all your planets suddenly go dark?
2010-09-12T18:52:30  <PabloM> yes
2010-09-12T18:52:44  <a1k0n> that means you were kicked for making an invalid move
2010-09-12T18:52:51  <jmreardon> PabloM: you've timed out, crashed, or sumbitted an illegal move
2010-09-12T18:53:13  <danielvf> jmcarthur: What is the long term, right thing to do
2010-09-12T18:53:14  <jmreardon> or is it just illegal moves?
2010-09-12T18:53:24  <a1k0n> the simulator really should, like, print to stderr "player 2 did x which is illegal because y"
2010-09-12T18:53:38  <a1k0n> i think timeouts might do it too, actually

2010-09-12T18:56:08  <jmreardon> PabloM: if you have an old starter pack you may want to update, they fixed some bugs that sound like that after the initial release

2010-09-12T18:56:26  <tebele> I have that problem too
2010-09-12T18:56:33  <jmcarthur> danielvf: our options are basically: ptrace, bsd jail, or vm. each has some tradeoffs, and none are perfect even from a pure security standpoint
2010-09-12T18:56:35  <PabloM> jmreardon: I downloaded it today
2010-09-12T18:56:55  <jmreardon> PabloM: probably not then
2010-09-12T18:57:04  <jmcarthur> ptrace is probably the closest to perfect, but the speed hit is killer
2010-09-12T18:57:11  <danielvf> What about vm + jail?
2010-09-12T18:57:52  <jmcarthur> it would reasonable
2010-09-12T18:58:04  <jmcarthur> the existing qemu code was probably on the right track. i forget why that was abandoned
2010-09-12T18:58:11  <jmcarthur> but qemu+kvm would be good
2010-09-12T18:58:14  <jmcarthur> or headless virtualbox
2010-09-12T18:58:24  <jmcarthur> we have to be careful with vms though

2010-09-12T18:58:41  <jmcarthur> it's easy to introduce holes if you aren't thorough
2010-09-12T18:59:05  <jmcarthur> even the lease secure vm would probably be more secure than what we have now though

2010-09-12T18:59:57  <jmcarthur> mietek: too hard on server
2010-09-12T19:00:26  <mietek> Does that mean POSIX threads?
2010-09-12T19:00:30  <jmcarthur> also a good way to starve other bots
2010-09-12T19:00:33  <jmcarthur> yeah no pthreads
2010-09-12T19:00:38  <jmcarthur> you can use green threads
2010-09-12T19:00:45  <jmcarthur> but only if they all run in a single os thread

2010-09-12T19:06:16  <jmcarthur> but it's not very applicable

This is way slower than it ought to be! I think its the JVM start up time that kills the performance, has anyone got anything like this running where it does not need to start a new vm for each bot every game?

2010-09-12T19:27:39  <delt0r_> because the input is really really slow
2010-09-12T19:28:33  <Ported> yeah i am using that as my base
2010-09-12T19:28:43  <delt0r_> So its writen like C
2010-09-12T19:28:45  <Ported> do you mean the way it reads stdin?
2010-09-12T19:29:02  <delt0r_> the slowest way to write java is to write it like c
2010-09-12T19:29:03  <delt0r_> yea
2010-09-12T19:29:14  <delt0r_> You should use a LineNumberReader

2010-09-12T19:30:46  <delt0r_> However JVM startup time is definatly going to make the run all slow
2010-09-12T19:31:06  <Ported> why a LineNumberReader? And not just a BufferedReader?
2010-09-12T19:31:15  <delt0r_> takes about 10min for mine right now... but i don't use a second for a turn like i should

2010-09-12T19:40:46  <danielvf> amstan: the iowait is due to mysql having to seek alot, even when checking just a hundred games or so, it has to seek all over the disk because the gamestates are so huge
2010-09-12T19:40:48  <RainCT> oh nice, I've just won my first game on tcp :P
2010-09-12T19:41:07  <yuwei> Apophis: thanks, miss out the last 9
2010-09-12T19:41:08  <amstan> danielvf: don't we have an index?
2010-09-12T19:41:13  <danielvf> we do
2010-09-12T19:41:26  <greghaynes> RainCT: It worked?
2010-09-12T19:41:26  <danielvf> But it still has to seek to each record that matches the index
2010-09-12T19:41:32  <danielvf> amstan: I'm adding two indexes to cover the entire fields that profile code uses
2010-09-12T19:41:52  <danielvf> This will let it work entirely in the index
2010-09-12T19:41:53  <RainCT> greghaynes: nope, I played another game with tcp.c to verify it wasn't my connection being stupid (and won that one :))

2010-09-12T19:44:59  <cYmen> hmpf..ok does anybody have a sample bot for me that outputs stuff to a file for debugging?

2010-09-12T19:45:45  <rogue780_> cYmen, I have a Log() method for my java bot

2010-09-12T19:46:35  <dmj111> I have not checked that out yet, but there is also a post in the forum where someone shows how to use the logging module.
2010-09-12T19:46:36  <preetum> if you use the python engine source, you can get some actual debugging working
2010-09-12T19:46:37  <rogue780_> ok nevermind

2010-09-12T19:47:11  <preetum> is the uploader/engine down?
2010-09-12T19:47:15  <rogue780_> Naktibalda, have you thought of using Quercus for your bot at all?
2010-09-12T19:47:21  <Naktibalda> no
2010-09-12T19:47:27  <rogue780_> IIRC, it allows you to put your php files in a jar and then run them with java.
2010-09-12T19:47:49  <rogue780_> It might be a good temporary workaround since it would allow you to officially submit your bot
2010-09-12T19:48:15  <Naktibalda> I'm not in a hurry

2010-09-12T20:10:39  <ulope> AJC: Yeah thats a bit unfortunate. I will probably put a warning in there or even change it. a neutral planet cant have reinf. fleets because there are no neutral fleets

2010-09-12T20:25:48  <rogue780_> well, in my defense, all I ever do is commit or checkout
2010-09-12T20:25:52  <rogue780_> never merged or anything
2010-09-12T20:25:57  <jmpespxoreax> with one person?
2010-09-12T20:26:02  <rogue780_> just me
2010-09-12T20:26:13  <rogue780_> i've never had the opportunity to code with anyone else
2010-09-12T20:26:14  <amstan> rogue780_: still a good idea to use git
2010-09-12T20:26:24  <greghaynes> No local commit are such a PITA
2010-09-12T20:26:28  <delt0r___> rogue780_: Even in that case i find git very usefull
2010-09-12T20:26:29  <greghaynes> er, is
2010-09-12T20:26:41  <rogue780_> I like my free private repo. I have to pay for a private repo with github
2010-09-12T20:26:50  <amstan> rogue780_: git is private..
2010-09-12T20:26:56  <amstan> as private as it can ever be
2010-09-12T20:27:02  <rogue780_> and being an unemployed college student, free is awesome
2010-09-12T20:27:03  <amstan> for svn you need a server
2010-09-12T20:27:11  <rogue780_> amstan, and I have one
2010-09-12T20:27:12  <greghaynes> All you need is ssh to host git somewhere
2010-09-12T20:27:19  <greghaynes> So use a lab computer at school
2010-09-12T20:27:27  <amstan> greghaynes: meh... http
2010-09-12T20:27:43  <greghaynes> http is le suck for git hosting
2010-09-12T20:27:45  <rogue780_> my problem is that I have 3 computers that I develop on at any given time and I want to keep things synchronized. svn server does that for me
2010-09-12T20:28:02  <jmpespxoreax> so does git if you configure it
2010-09-12T20:28:04  <greghaynes> You know what else does that.... ;)
2010-09-12T20:28:10  <jmpespxoreax> just use whatever
2010-09-12T20:28:12  <amstan> rogue780_: so... git pull from all your comps before starting to work.
2010-09-12T20:28:13  <jmpespxoreax> and write code
2010-09-12T20:28:20  <amstan> rogue780_: you don't need a central place
2010-09-12T20:28:45  <greghaynes> What sucks is if youre somewhere without internet and using svn
2010-09-12T20:28:53  <rogue780_> meh. I like being able to pull my netbook out at school and sync it then if I forgot.
2010-09-12T20:29:02  <rogue780_> greghaynes, phone tether :)
2010-09-12T20:29:03  <dstufft_> what sucks is if you're .. using svn
2010-09-12T20:29:07  <dstufft_> fixed
2010-09-12T20:29:16  <delt0r___> rogue780_: This is what i use git --keeping my 5 computers "synced"
2010-09-12T20:29:17  <rogue780_> jeez. all the hate
2010-09-12T20:29:17  <greghaynes> rogue780_: Doesnt work on plane, I have that too ;)
2010-09-12T20:29:25  <amstan> rogue780_: you can do all these things with git, by default
2010-09-12T20:29:25  <dstufft_> svn: atleast it's not cvs
2010-09-12T20:29:33  <greghaynes> Ill support that
2010-09-12T20:29:33  <delt0r___> git hadels the case where your forgot to "commit" way better than svn
2010-09-12T20:29:44  <greghaynes> Its definitely not cvs, thank god
2010-09-12T20:29:50  <danielvf> svn > cvs > nothing

2010-09-12T20:57:44  <sfsgagi> seems like ladder is not working
2010-09-12T20:57:57  <jmcarthur> aw man, cache keeps the old css until you manually hit refresh so the spec looks bad until you do that
2010-09-12T20:58:01  <jmcarthur> oh well
2010-09-12T20:58:07  <deepblue> bartwe number 4 seems quite good

2010-09-12T20:58:27  <jmcarthur> dstufft_: hey thanks!
2010-09-12T20:58:30  * jmcarthur does it
2010-09-12T20:58:50  <dstufft_> infact if you do that for all static files, and increment the number everytime it changes
2010-09-12T20:58:57  <dstufft_> you can cache shit for like 30 days or even more
2010-09-12T20:59:08  <dstufft_> and when a static file changes, you just increase the v=X
2010-09-12T20:59:26  <danielvf> jmcarthur:  lol
2010-09-12T21:00:14  <rogue780> greghaynes, do you know where I can get the source for qmake?
2010-09-12T21:00:28  <greghaynes> rogue780: Itll be in the Qt dev package
2010-09-12T21:00:32  <jmcarthur> dstufft_: yeah, i knew the trick but never had to use it, so it didn't come to mind
2010-09-12T21:00:43  <greghaynes> rogue780: There should be a win version
2010-09-12T21:00:57  <rogue780> I'm compiling with cygwin, so i need to build the source
2010-09-12T21:01:01  <greghaynes> ah
2010-09-12T21:01:03  <dstufft_> jmcarthur: ah
2010-09-12T21:01:05  <rogue780> unless there's a cygwin package out there
2010-09-12T21:01:18  <dstufft_> i <3 that trick, i have my django projects setup to do it automatically

2010-09-12T21:04:59  <rogue780> greghaynes, I would think. but the only qt packages that cygwin has don't contain qmake. very frustrating

2010-09-12T23:34:21  <Janzert> It was changed, the draft game specification explains the new method http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/GameSpecification

2010-09-12T23:34:34  <deepblue> reduced by second largest fleet size
2010-09-12T23:34:36  <bss03> It's the method 3 a.k.a. all fleets fight at once.
2010-09-12T23:34:42  <deepblue> ^^
2010-09-12T23:34:44  <Zaphus> amstam: but, as expected with randomness, other bots have played many games in that time just by the luck of the dice
2010-09-12T23:35:01  <amstan> Zaphus: if others have have around 11 games too, there's not much that can be done
2010-09-12T23:35:20  <PlanetWarrior> Ok so the two arriving fleets arrive in mid-air, duke it out and then the winner fights the fleet on the planet?
2010-09-12T23:35:39  <Janzert> nope :)
2010-09-12T23:36:13  <Janzert> basically they all fight simultaneously but read the spec it gives a better explanation
2010-09-12T23:36:37  <Janzert> and it boils down to biggest fleet wins with it's number reduced by second largest
2010-09-12T23:36:38  <dstufft_> i think the smallest force basically get's ignored
2010-09-12T23:36:56  <Zaphus> amstam:  yes, it could prioritize people who havent played in a long time (after dealing with the people who have very small numbers of games) - e.g. someone who has played more games and had 5 games in that time period, should have shared some of those slots with others who had none :-)
2010-09-12T23:37:38  <bss03> Biggest - 2nd Biggest is just an easy way to calculate the results.
2010-09-12T23:37:59  * Janzert agrees
2010-09-12T23:38:00  <bss03> The algorithim is eliminate 1 ship from each fleet until 1 or less fleets remain.
2010-09-12T23:38:04  <amstan> Zaphus: stop calling me amstam, lol, it doesn't highlight me then
2010-09-12T23:38:28  <Zaphus> amstan: lol, sorry
2010-09-12T23:38:32  <PlanetWarrior> Ok I understand I was wrong in what I said and thanks for the GameSpecification link. It spells it out very well. I hadn't seen obvious links to it while browsing even though it seems to be a very important document.
2010-09-12T23:38:55  <Zaphus> amstan: maybe I didnt really want you to see my reply, just talking to myself like those guys in Hyde Park in London
2010-09-12T23:38:56  <bss03> If one fleet reamins it takes the planet, if 0 fleets reamin the planet stays under control of the current owner.
2010-09-12T23:39:22  <Janzert> yeah, it's just a draft that was written up. I don't know that it has been officially approved, that's why it's not linked prominently I assume
2010-09-12T23:39:28  <amstan> Zaphus: lol, ok
2010-09-12T23:39:58  <sigh> The spec is available on the main site: http://www.ai-contest.com/specification.php
2010-09-12T23:40:17  <sigh> dunno if that means that it is officially approved
2010-09-12T23:40:21  <Janzert> ahh, and I see the sidebar also links to it now
2010-09-12T23:40:24  <Zaphus> amstan: still, I want another game for my bot :-)   are we still on the random/random scheduler, or now on the one that prioritizes people with low games ?
2010-09-12T23:40:43  <Janzert> I would assume yes that does make it official now :)
2010-09-12T23:40:46  <sigh> :)

2010-09-12T23:45:54  <PlanetWarrior> Another quick question - The fleets are sent, advance one step and arrival is then processed. Doesn't this mean that in the hypothetical case where two planets are at a distance of 1 away from each other then fleets sent between the two planets never actually show up in the "fleets" portion of the game state string. They just result in changes to the planet populations?
