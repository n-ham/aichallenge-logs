2010-10-12T00:04:57  <sigh> no worries
2010-10-12T00:05:24  <sigh> copying sounds like an interesting tactic until you think about it, then it fails hard
2010-10-12T00:05:32  <sigh> sort of like in Go :P
2010-10-12T00:05:45  <cfaftw> lol... so much fun to watch, though
2010-10-12T00:05:58  <cfaftw> his copybot, i mean
2010-10-12T00:06:14  <sigh> did you watch the game he posted earlier: http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5800022
2010-10-12T00:06:59  <cfaftw> no... but his bot seems to break
2010-10-12T00:07:13  <sigh> example?
2010-10-12T00:07:14  <cfaftw> yeah i saw that one
2010-10-12T00:07:43  <cfaftw> this is marked as a loss for him, so his bot actually did issue an invalid order: http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5808409
2010-10-12T00:08:02  <cfaftw> it's like he doesn't check of a planet actually has the ships needed to mimic a move

2010-10-12T00:09:30  <Zannick> there is checking going on

2010-10-12T00:10:46  <cfaftw> oh
2010-10-12T00:10:53  <Zannick> no wonder it's making invalid orders, that's a prebugfix bot
2010-10-12T00:10:57  <cfaftw> link to your fixed copybot?
2010-10-12T00:11:06  <Zannick> there is none :P
2010-10-12T00:11:10  <cfaftw> :(
2010-10-12T00:11:15  <cfaftw> that copybot is hilarious to watch
2010-10-12T00:11:18  <Zannick> well
2010-10-12T00:11:22  <sigh> cfaftw: it takes like 15 min to write one :P
2010-10-12T00:11:45  <cfaftw> i'm sure
2010-10-12T00:12:58  <sigh> I wrote one as a basic bot to test against ages ago, before quickly realizing how much it sucked :P
2010-10-12T00:13:58  <cfaftw> i wonder, though, if a copy-bot could be fairly successful if it performs its own decision on turn 1, then proceeds to copy moves
2010-10-12T00:14:26  <sigh> it's a bit hard to copy once the symmetry is broken
2010-10-12T00:14:28  <Zannick> i could reupload

2010-10-12T00:33:10  <Zannick> that compiled fast
2010-10-12T00:34:08  <Zannick> and i can tell it went through the new script, too, thanks to it now noting compile time.

2010-10-12T01:27:39  <pjreddie> ok seriously, this is ridiculous
2010-10-12T01:27:48  <pjreddie> i just submitted the started package bot
2010-10-12T01:27:49  <pjreddie> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5816999
2010-10-12T01:28:02  <pjreddie> it failed to start. i swear it's like my name or something
2010-10-12T01:30:29  <Zannick> :(
2010-10-12T01:31:53  <Zannick> erm
2010-10-12T01:32:36  <Zannick> looks all right to me
2010-10-12T01:32:43  <Zannick> that may have been an old bot
2010-10-12T01:32:55  <Zannick> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5817148
2010-10-12T01:33:19  <rabidus> wow, two ids right next to other
2010-10-12T01:34:34  <pjreddie> reupped the starter and it seemed to work that time
2010-10-12T01:34:39  <pjreddie> this is really strange...
2010-10-12T01:35:02  <Zannick> i noticed two games on the earlier submission two that looked like they worked
2010-10-12T01:35:09  <Zannick> the one you linked must have been before that
2010-10-12T01:35:16  <pjreddie> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5817253 first game with actual code uploaded seems to be doing ok
2010-10-12T01:35:23  <Zannick> so i think there is something wrong with your bot
2010-10-12T01:35:49  <rabidus> yeah
2010-10-12T01:35:52  <pjreddie> i think it may have been cause i was putting it in a folder and then zipping it, is that possible?
2010-10-12T01:36:21  <janzert> Zannick: Not sure if it's a problem right now but, the cloud servers won't pick up the compile_anything changes unless it's committed to the cloud branch as well.
2010-10-12T01:36:24  <Zannick> don't know, i do that
2010-10-12T01:36:46  <Zannick> janzert: hm, guess i'll look into it
2010-10-12T01:36:50  <janzert> i.e. the cloud servers will still be compiling with the old version
2010-10-12T01:37:13  <pjreddie> hm, my bot just made it through it's first game, we'll see if it continues to be ok...
2010-10-12T01:37:26  <janzert> only problem I see is if your new version will compile things that the old one errors out on
2010-10-12T01:37:40  <janzert> which IIRC C programs did?
2010-10-12T01:37:58  <Zannick> pjreddie: just curious, what did you submit so far today? there are 5 i see, starting oct 12 00:04:02
2010-10-12T01:38:29  <Zannick> starter only?
2010-10-12T01:38:40  <Zannick> before this working submission?
2010-10-12T01:38:40  <pjreddie> no, the most recent was my actual code
2010-10-12T01:38:51  <pjreddie> then there were 3 submissions of starter
2010-10-12T01:39:04  <pjreddie> the second two seemed to work, the first one seemed not to
2010-10-12T01:39:28  <Zannick> that's four, what about the other one?
2010-10-12T01:39:35  <pjreddie> that was my code too
2010-10-12T01:39:51  <pjreddie> but an empty doturn method
2010-10-12T01:39:55  <pjreddie> that just returned
2010-10-12T01:40:19  <Zannick> so either my compile change fixed your bot...or you got lucky
2010-10-12T01:40:20  <Zannick> weird
2010-10-12T01:40:47  <janzert> Just noticed, don't just dump the new compile_anything into the cloud branch either
2010-10-12T01:41:27  <janzert> the cloud tournament_manager calls the compile_anything.compile_function directly with only one argument
2010-10-12T01:41:41  <janzert> instead of the two it now takes
2010-10-12T01:43:05  <Zannick> hm, that's not hard to work around
2010-10-12T01:43:30  <janzert> yeah, should be an easy fix. just need to be sure to do it
2010-10-12T01:44:12  <pjreddie> well my bot when it was having problems only had problems occasionally. like 1/5 of the time it'd run, and the other times it would crash, so we'll see
2010-10-12T01:44:19  <Zannick> ah

2010-10-12T01:57:56  <Zannick> i could also do "if not ret:" instead of leaving the check against err

2010-10-12T02:02:53  <janzert> yeah, using the return value seems like the better check here
2010-10-12T02:02:53  <Zannick> okay, now it's http://pastebin.com/fN1cBzp5
2010-10-12T02:03:34  <Zannick> yeah, i'm worried there might be compile errors returning 1 from eg, g++, but no error message.
2010-10-12T02:04:24  <janzert> yeah, that looks better. really it needs to get rewritten to use a temp directory with a rename after successfully compiling to avoid the race condition mentioned in the comment
2010-10-12T02:04:42  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-12T02:04:54  <Zannick> i don't want to touch too much of danielvf's work yet, though
2010-10-12T02:05:00  <janzert> yeah
2010-10-12T02:05:53  <janzert> hmm, I wonder if some of the erroneous 1st turn timeouts are caused by that race
2010-10-12T02:06:22  <Zannick> if that's the case, this needs to be done sooner rather than later
2010-10-12T02:07:06  <janzert> it actually wouldn't surprise me because I realized the other night the way games are handed out I think the same pair can be handed out multiple times until the first one returns a result
2010-10-12T02:07:37  <janzert> well, if they are really being handed out the way svn shows it still
2010-10-12T02:08:11  <janzert> well same pair isn't real likely, but same first player for sure

2010-10-12T02:08:45  <Zannick> well, hm.
2010-10-12T02:08:47  <Zannick> that depends
2010-10-12T02:09:01  <janzert> but I also know that the code in use isn't the same as svn since the pairing doesn't match up
2010-10-12T02:09:11  <Zannick> if they're two different threads, yeah, that could be a race
2010-10-12T02:09:26  <Zannick> but if they're different processes, they have their own cwd, i think
2010-10-12T02:09:53  <janzert> what part depends on cwd?
2010-10-12T02:10:08  <janzert> not sure which race you're referring to here :)
2010-10-12T02:10:12  <Zannick> os.chdir changes the directory
2010-10-12T02:10:24  <Zannick> also the os.system("cd %s...")
2010-10-12T02:10:27  <janzert> yep to the submission directory that is common server wide
2010-10-12T02:10:54  <janzert> so once a submission is compiled it is used on that server ever after
2010-10-12T02:11:05  <Zannick> yes, but it is a folder specific to that submission
2010-10-12T02:11:24  <Zannick> submission_dir = "../submissions/%d" % submission_id
2010-10-12T02:11:30  <janzert> right
2010-10-12T02:11:47  <Zannick> if two workers share the same cwd, then one will win the cd race
2010-10-12T02:12:04  <Zannick> and compile_function uses the cwd for glob
2010-10-12T02:12:12  <janzert> and if the first manager is still in the process of compiling or even downloading when the other checks for the existance of the directory it will try and use it before it is ready
2010-10-12T02:12:45  <janzert> line 57 will be true
2010-10-12T02:13:14  <janzert> since it downloads and compiles the final directory directly

2010-10-12T02:14:44  <Blkt> good day everyone
2010-10-12T02:14:57  <rabidus> @tcp
2010-10-12T02:14:57  <contestbot> rabidus: tcp = http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/
2010-10-12T02:15:17  <Zannick> that should be a check for an executable or script or whatnot
2010-10-12T02:15:31  <janzert> that would help for sure
2010-10-12T02:15:54  <Zannick> better would be a file flag or something
2010-10-12T02:16:07  <Zannick> like, if compile was success, touch ../success/%d
2010-10-12T02:16:12  <janzert> just use a temporary directory and rename it into place when finished
2010-10-12T02:16:24  <Zannick> oh, yeah, that's better
2010-10-12T02:16:36  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@202.129.235.15> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2010-10-12T02:16:47  <janzert> as long as the rename isn't across filesystems it's generally guaranteed to be atomic on most unix filesystems
2010-10-12T02:16:55  <janzert> at least local filesystems that is
2010-10-12T02:17:50  <Zannick> there will still be an issue with recompiling the same submission in multiple temp directories
2010-10-12T02:18:11  <janzert> yeah, but that's just wasteful not actually harmful
2010-10-12T02:18:16  <Zannick> but...yeah
2010-10-12T02:18:24  <Zannick> still, i'd rather not have it do that
2010-10-12T02:18:40  <Zannick> but that fix can wait, the temp directories should go first
2010-10-12T02:18:50  <janzert> yep
2010-10-12T02:20:21  <janzert> and syncing compile_anything should probably even happen sooner
2010-10-12T02:20:32  <Zannick> well, that's in the branch now
2010-10-12T02:20:38  <janzert> ahh, great
2010-10-12T02:20:54  <Zannick> i'll just comment on the manager script in the branch for now
2010-10-12T02:22:02  <janzert> well it already has the comment about the race condition existing
2010-10-12T02:22:38  <Zannick> this is a comment on code.google.com, not a comment in the code
2010-10-12T02:22:44  <janzert> ahh
2010-10-12T02:24:46  * janzert really wishes he could go sync the server code and svn :/
2010-10-12T02:25:21  *** wvdschel <wvdschel!~wim@mansamusa.elis.UGent.be> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-12T02:25:23  <janzert> meaning from the server to svn, not the other way at the moment
2010-10-12T02:25:54  <Zannick> it's a little tempting to say "screw it" and be an admin and fix everything
2010-10-12T02:26:45  <janzert> yeah, I went ahead and wrote j3camero an email last night offering to if he wanted since I'm doing more work on contest code than bot code anyway
2010-10-12T02:26:52  <Zannick> heh
2010-10-12T02:28:32  <amstan> janzert: wanna be admin?
2010-10-12T02:28:47  <amstan> janzert: so.. i could sync stuff, but i need to make sure nothing will break
2010-10-12T02:29:02  <amstan> i just don't want to get too involved in the code, i don't like it
2010-10-12T02:29:15  <janzert> I sent Jeff an email offering but haven't heard back
2010-10-12T02:29:26  <Zannick> i have 887 lines in my (unfinished) bot, so i think my bot is still ahead of my contributions to the server
2010-10-12T02:29:38  * janzert can understand that sentiment but also can understand how it came to be :)

2010-10-12T02:30:26  <janzert> and yeah I wouldn't sync the svn to the server without first syncing the server back out to svn and making sure it worked

2010-10-12T02:31:06  <janzert> the former sounds like a recipe for disaster, especially since there are schema changes to the database that aren't synced into svn
2010-10-12T02:31:41  <Zannick> okay, i've added 18 nonwhitespace characters to my bot today
2010-10-12T02:32:00  <Zannick> and it is about time to stop thinking for the day
2010-10-12T02:32:04  <janzert> see the contest code is sucking you in :P
2010-10-12T02:32:21  <Zannick> i've actually had a lot of other stuff to do
2010-10-12T02:32:43  <amstan> so.. i would like to contribute on this, but from scratch
2010-10-12T02:32:59  *** optimum <optimum!debian-tor@gateway/tor-sasl/optimum> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-10-12T02:33:01  <Zannick> i agree.
2010-10-12T02:33:03  <amstan> with git, scratch, no code that only jeff knows how to use
2010-10-12T02:33:15  <Zannick> and i will be onboard from the start for the next one
2010-10-12T02:33:23  <HakanD>  what happened to http://github.com/ai-contest ?
2010-10-12T02:33:42  <Zannick> i want to generalize the engine
2010-10-12T02:33:46  <amstan> HakanD: no idea who that is
2010-10-12T02:33:51  <amstan> Zannick: that was the idea
2010-10-12T02:34:01  *** optimum <optimum!debian-tor@gateway/tor-sasl/optimum> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-12T02:34:02  <amstan> what i want to do is make sure everything is modular and can be swapped out
2010-10-12T02:35:05  <janzert> it really wouldn't be *that* hard to get from where the code is now to that point
2010-10-12T02:35:23  <amstan> yes.. but a lot of stuff needs rewrites
2010-10-12T02:35:39  <amstan> including the main site
2010-10-12T02:35:49  <amstan> right now it's a collection of php scripts hacked together
2010-10-12T02:35:59  <janzert> yes, it has definitely accumulated to the point it is now
2010-10-12T02:36:43  <amstan> it should be done with sqlalchemy or something
2010-10-12T02:36:43  <janzert> or accreted
2010-10-12T02:36:48  <amstan> with object abstractions
2010-10-12T02:36:59  <amstan> especially for the scoreboard stuff
2010-10-12T02:37:14  <amstan> not to mention that we should get an api for the site, so players can use it
2010-10-12T02:37:15  * Zannick doesn't know much about php/frontend stuff
2010-10-12T02:37:20  <janzert> that was one of the first things I was surprised about the code was the direct use of mysqldb module
2010-10-12T02:37:34  <Zannick> i'll be perfectly happy with working on backend
2010-10-12T02:37:50  * janzert has been using sqlalchemy and sqlobject before that for so long I forgot anyone didn't use 'em :)
2010-10-12T02:38:12  <amstan> i propose we just get python everything
2010-10-12T02:38:17  <amstan> for the site too
2010-10-12T02:39:07  <janzert> it would be a little nicer not to switch between two languages
2010-10-12T02:39:13  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-10-12T02:39:17  <antimatroid> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=443149 that's embarassing
2010-10-12T02:39:29  <amstan> we could use common libraries then
2010-10-12T02:39:35  <amstan> and authentication scripts
2010-10-12T02:39:56  <amstan> this could be awesome..
2010-10-12T02:40:01  <janzert> :)
2010-10-12T02:40:34  <antimatroid> i think it'd be cool if not only were there starter packages, but ai libraries for newcomers to use
2010-10-12T02:40:41  <Blkt> antimatroid: lol @ graph
2010-10-12T02:40:43  <antimatroid> so they can implement their strategies quicker
2010-10-12T02:41:04  <amstan> antimatroid: what ai libraries?
2010-10-12T02:41:11  * janzert just has to make sure he remembers to keep enough time this month to prepare for the arimaa bot developers panel he is suppose to moderate :)
2010-10-12T02:41:14  <antimatroid> amstan: user written ones
2010-10-12T02:41:15  <HakanD> i can help with the visual side, a new design with some fancy stuff might be cool (:
2010-10-12T02:41:24  <antimatroid> i would contribute to something like that
2010-10-12T02:41:37  <rabidus> this is ai contest. not "who uses best this library" contest
2010-10-12T02:41:56  <amstan> rabidus: it's not about the best library, it's about how it's used
2010-10-12T02:42:02  <amstan> how developers use the tools they have
2010-10-12T02:42:12  <janzert> and how many are using pre-written ai libraries? :)
2010-10-12T02:42:35  <amstan> think of it like it would be a real life example
2010-10-12T02:42:41  <amstan> make a bot that goes fights aliens
2010-10-12T02:42:44  <rabidus> everyone should write their own code
2010-10-12T02:42:46  <janzert> I have a feeling it's pretty low and for newcomers especially I think they'll learn more by not using a library
2010-10-12T02:42:49  <antimatroid> yes, while i will always write my own, imo the competition is more about who can come up with the best strategy, the fact that implementations matter is an annoying necessity
2010-10-12T02:42:53  <rabidus> starterpackage is enough
2010-10-12T02:44:25  <janzert> I could see having more game specific framework in the starter packages but that would get quite hard across all the languages
2010-10-12T02:44:44  <antimatroid> it's not something i would expect the top competitors to get any use from, but i would expect the newcomers could actually get some better bots implemented which such aids and still learn a lot
2010-10-12T02:45:07  <antimatroid> you couldn't just use it as a black box, you would need to do considerable work to change it for a given game/problem
2010-10-12T02:45:20  <Blkt> I think that discussion about algorithms and nice ideas is much better than a good framework
2010-10-12T02:45:24  <antimatroid> or at least set things up
2010-10-12T02:46:51  <Blkt> what would you black box counting Tron challenge and this challenge? they don't have much in common
2010-10-12T02:48:28  <Blkt> a very nice thing Tron challenge had was the minimax and Voronoi stuff on that blog
2010-10-12T02:49:05  <Blkt> still, the framework itself was quite similar to the one for this contest
2010-10-12T02:51:14  <janzert> all the match making, ranking, submitting, etc. etc.
2010-10-12T02:51:39  <janzert> or you're talking about ai library sorry
2010-10-12T02:51:46  <Blkt> what do you mean?
2010-10-12T02:51:56  <Blkt> ai library
2010-10-12T02:52:03  <Blkt> I think it's not needed
2010-10-12T02:52:28  <janzert> I thought you were referring to the contest code
2010-10-12T02:52:36  <Blkt> nono

2010-10-12T05:02:55  <fluffluff1> ok, so 7 of my 10 games on the official server doesn't get to the second turn before the dreaded "crashed / did not start / timeout". I even set the internal time cap to 0.2s last night. everything works fine on the tcp server... I've heard bad things about the official server. are they true and this is not uncommon or is it somehow my fault after all?
2010-10-12T05:05:46  <rabidus> have you checked that your opponents works correctly
2010-10-12T05:05:53  <antimatroid> fluffluff1: it's most probably your bad, i have had issues with bot crashing the main site but not locally
2010-10-12T05:05:59  <antimatroid> it's usually me doing something i shouldn't
2010-10-12T05:06:19  <rabidus> common thing in my case is that i send too many ships
2010-10-12T05:06:32  <fluffluff1> rab: yeah, they've had proper games
2010-10-12T05:06:33  <rabidus> or twice from same planet to dest planet
2010-10-12T05:06:44  <rabidus> ok, i think then that's just you
2010-10-12T05:06:46  <rabidus> in your code
2010-10-12T05:06:50  <fluffluff1> ok, thanks guys, that's reassuring at least :)
2010-10-12T05:07:38  <aerique> mega1: oh dear
2010-10-12T05:07:46  <mega1> aerique: have you found it?
2010-10-12T05:07:54  <fluffluff1> hm, aren't you allowed to send twice between the same planets?
2010-10-12T05:08:07  <rabidus> not in same turn
2010-10-12T05:08:27  <Naktibalda> oh really? I think it's allowed
2010-10-12T05:08:33  <rabidus> i mean when source planet and destination planet is same
2010-10-12T05:08:34  <Naktibalda> there was a patch to merge fleets
2010-10-12T05:08:42  <aerique> mega1: no, i haven't uploaded for a couple of days
2010-10-12T05:08:54  <fluffluff1> yeah, I too was under the impression that was allowed
2010-10-12T05:09:04  <rabidus> like pw.Issueorders(1,2,3); pw.issueorders(1,2,3)
2010-10-12T05:09:08  <fluffluff1> yes
2010-10-12T05:09:29  <fluffluff1> assuming you've got >=6 ships on planet 1 I thought/think that was ok
2010-10-12T05:09:44  <rabidus> afaik it isn't
2010-10-12T05:09:56  <rabidus> i think that was the case
2010-10-12T05:10:27  <fluffluff1> alright, that's interesting. might be my problem then, though it's odd that 3 of my games played ok in that case

2010-10-12T06:27:41  <rabidus> i would like to see those bots fighting with humans :)
2010-10-12T06:27:54  <epona> they should do it
2010-10-12T06:28:04  <rabidus> yeah
2010-10-12T06:28:07  <epona> maybe if they gave humans better controls
2010-10-12T06:28:07  <rabidus> that would be fun
2010-10-12T06:28:15  <epona> id like it with tons of hotkeys
2010-10-12T06:28:18  <rabidus> and turns lasts like minute :D
2010-10-12T06:28:22  <rabidus> so you have time to think

2010-10-12T06:28:56  <rabidus> yep
2010-10-12T06:29:28  <epona> itd inspire me more
2010-10-12T06:29:31  <epona> if i couldn't win
2010-10-12T06:29:34  <rabidus> :)
2010-10-12T06:29:47  <rabidus> actually that would be awesome
2010-10-12T06:30:06  <janzert> seeing as the standard "real" galcon ai is currently ranked 1186 it's not unlikely the top bots are better than humans
2010-10-12T06:30:26  <janzert> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=3907
2010-10-12T06:30:45  <rabidus> that's _the_  galcon ?
2010-10-12T06:31:01  <janzert> yes, from *the* author :)
2010-10-12T06:31:06  <rabidus> hehe, cool
2010-10-12T06:31:09  <dmj111> without all the calculations available to my bot... i wouldn't play it :/
2010-10-12T06:31:41  <epona> aw comon
2010-10-12T06:31:45  <janzert> yeah, this is definitely a case where computer exact calculation beats human pattern recognition
2010-10-12T06:31:53  <epona> if it was customizabe
2010-10-12T06:31:54  <epona> ble
2010-10-12T06:32:04  <epona> so you could input your algorithms into buttons
2010-10-12T06:32:27  <dmj111> i thought of writing an interface to play the bot, but have the interface show me the kinds of numbers that the bot saw.
2010-10-12T06:32:51  <dmj111> i keep tweaking my bot instead :)
2010-10-12T06:33:03  <epona> make sure you release it after you win :P
2010-10-12T06:33:25  <janzert> yeah, cyborging it here might be able to beat the bot
2010-10-12T06:33:45  <dmj111> janzert: it might be fun too.
2010-10-12T06:33:57  <janzert> I think it would
2010-10-12T06:35:02  <dmj111> epona: regardless of my outcome I will post my bot.  By the time november 27th comes around, my bot may be in the dustbins of history though :)

2010-10-12T07:17:59  <janzert> it's actually more in depth in areas than anything I've seen on the official forum so far
2010-10-12T07:20:40  <antimatroid> yep, looks good, i shall troll through it all at some point
2010-10-12T07:20:52  <antimatroid> i've already put a lot of thought into this game myself
2010-10-12T07:21:13  <antimatroid> i disagree about it being easily solvable
2010-10-12T07:21:23  <antimatroid> someone at my uni claimed the same when i showed them the comp
2010-10-12T07:21:35  <antimatroid> my answer to that is go ahead and write such a perfect bot then :P
2010-10-12T07:21:38  <janzert> I'm pretty convinced now as well
2010-10-12T07:22:21  <antimatroid> there are so many possible ways to set your strategy i expect the top bots to be a lot more varied than with tron
2010-10-12T07:22:58  <antimatroid> i should get back to playing around with the game theory side of things again, i am not entirely unconvinced about some kind of approximate minimax still working really well
2010-10-12T07:23:00  <janzert> I don't know if I say it in that thread anywhere, my worry is/was just that with tron it's quickly possible to show that the problem is NP-complete there isn't a way looking at planetwars to easily prove there isn't a shortcut to get the optimal strategy that dominates all others
2010-10-12T07:23:45  <janzert> if there was an obvious way to do it, someone would have found it by now though
2010-10-12T07:24:07  <epona> there isn't ONE obvious way
2010-10-12T07:24:09  <antimatroid> i'm not positive one can't some up with a near perfect strategy, but i don't think it's going to be overly done if there is
2010-10-12T07:24:24  <epona> theres a bunch of obvious ways you have to account for
2010-10-12T07:24:29  <antimatroid> i have played around with dp approaches and couldn't work out a way that would solve it in time
2010-10-12T07:24:31  <epona> like what if someone is ragebot?
2010-10-12T07:24:39  <epona> grabbing three planets will make you lose
2010-10-12T07:24:50  <antimatroid> i never lose to ragebot, ever
2010-10-12T07:24:52  <janzert> the tactics are important enough and tricky enough to get right that it'll stop most people from getting that part correct
2010-10-12T07:24:52  <antimatroid> i may draw, that's it

2010-10-12T07:34:43  <rabidus> controls different versions? :D
2010-10-12T07:35:01  <epona> of?
2010-10-12T07:35:12  <antimatroid> your programs
2010-10-12T07:35:25  <antimatroid> easy access to past versions
2010-10-12T07:35:27  <epona> oh you mean like 2.7 and 3.1 in python?
2010-10-12T07:35:34  <antimatroid> pretty much
2010-10-12T07:35:35  <foucist> epona: look at git
2010-10-12T07:35:43  <foucist> or fossil
2010-10-12T07:35:58  <antimatroid> it's too hard to win every game
2010-10-12T07:36:13  <antimatroid> i can't consistently beat everyone on tcp, it's very annoying
2010-10-12T07:37:08  <antimatroid> lol, my bot from last night's last few games has it now on top
2010-10-12T07:38:23  <dmj111> you just reminded me that mine isn
2010-10-12T07:38:32  <dmj111> 't running (thunderstorms)
2010-10-12T07:38:42  <dmj111> I'll have to start it back up in a little bit.
2010-10-12T07:40:33  <antimatroid> i can't seem to get mine very strong atm
2010-10-12T07:40:47  <antimatroid> it keeps losing to people with lower rankings
2010-10-12T07:41:35  <delt0r___> I noticed that in tron the maps were a lot more varied than for this challenge...
2010-10-12T07:41:54  <delt0r___> was it like that from the start... or did it change after a while?
2010-10-12T07:42:24  <delt0r___> which applies here... are we likely to see quite different maps --as in size and number of planets
2010-10-12T07:42:25  <delt0r___> ?
2010-10-12T07:42:41  <Naktibalda> hmm, my bot slowly climbed to #69. It took 1.5 days

2010-10-12T07:43:29  <janzert> IIRC, A big problem with the initial tron maps is they were mostly too small and simple and the better bots were quite quickly always tying on them
2010-10-12T07:43:47  *** wvdschel <wvdschel!~wim@mansamusa.elis.UGent.be> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-12T07:43:54  <delt0r___> janzert: right... not the case here....
2010-10-12T07:43:54  <janzert> so it led to a push for bigger more complicated maps and the random map generator got written
2010-10-12T07:44:10  <janzert> yep
2010-10-12T07:44:47  <delt0r___> I am a big proponet of random maps in the first place... not just 100 maps generated randomly... but every map is random.
2010-10-12T07:45:12  <antimatroid> some maps with more planets would be cool
2010-10-12T07:45:19  <delt0r___> but 100 is a good approximation...
2010-10-12T07:45:20  <delt0r___> yea
2010-10-12T07:45:26  <antimatroid> i wrote a lattice map generator, but people weren't very keen on using those maps officially

2010-10-12T07:45:45  <delt0r___> Naktibalda: yea---200 IIRC
2010-10-12T07:46:03  <janzert> the official server or just tcp?
2010-10-12T07:46:28  <delt0r___> well i would "like" bigger maps with more planets... but i would also like a lot of games played per hour
2010-10-12T07:46:30  <delt0r___> janzert: TCP
2010-10-12T07:46:41  <Naktibalda> map_id=707
2010-10-12T07:46:45  <delt0r___> Naktibalda: you meant TCP? yes
2010-10-12T07:46:53  <Naktibalda> I mean official
2010-10-12T07:46:57  <delt0r___> oh
2010-10-12T07:47:00  <delt0r___> didn't know that

2010-10-12T07:47:55  <Naktibalda> hmm, it looks like most of games are played in maps <100
2010-10-12T07:48:08  <Naktibalda> but there are at least some maps with high ids
2010-10-12T07:48:41  <delt0r___> map id should be the seed to generate the map...
2010-10-12T07:48:55  <delt0r___> then you can have anything....
2010-10-12T07:49:27  <Naktibalda> yep, and map generation is rather cheap, so it doesn't increase server load a lot
2010-10-12T07:50:08  <nrub> gotta love this line in the java viewer source code:
2010-10-12T07:50:19  <nrub>  // HACKY FIX BECAUSE JAVA BLOWS
2010-10-12T07:50:31  <janzert> just remembered all the maps used on the cloud servers are in svn
2010-10-12T07:50:31  <nrub> (I do not agree with this sentiment)
2010-10-12T07:50:45  <delt0r___> nrub: The java viewer is clearly writen by someone who doesn't know java....
2010-10-12T07:50:55  <delt0r___> I wouldn't read much into it
2010-10-12T07:51:09  <delt0r___> well no more than a java programer complaining about C
2010-10-12T07:51:19  <janzert> looks like the cloud servers only get 100 maps
2010-10-12T07:51:41  <janzert> maybe the main server has more, do all the high map id's have worker=0?
2010-10-12T07:52:41  <janzert> which would also explain why only the occasional game has a high map
2010-10-12T07:56:10  <nrub> I don't want to bash Jeff's code, I just think it's funny reading his comments
2010-10-12T07:56:29  <nrub> the comments in the catch clauses for some exceptions are funny

2010-10-12T09:02:30  <rabidus> i can't say which bot is best on top10
2010-10-12T09:03:46  <antimatroid> hazard has had first most consistently i would say
2010-10-12T09:03:54  <antimatroid> asavis is new to top 10?
2010-10-12T09:04:10  <rabidus> extrapostrophe was #1 yesterday
2010-10-12T09:04:16  <rabidus> with 4k points
2010-10-12T09:04:19  <antimatroid> i just put a bot up that i think will go top 10 maybe
2010-10-12T09:04:41  <antimatroid> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=youwillfail it's doing that atm
2010-10-12T09:04:45  <antimatroid> i changed it since last lose

2010-10-12T09:07:17  <epona> perfect logic
2010-10-12T09:08:18  <antimatroid> not really, it should have taken the win already
2010-10-12T09:08:24  <antimatroid> and stopped bloody expanding
2010-10-12T09:08:37  <epona> camping is fine
2010-10-12T09:09:15  <antimatroid> meh, it's cooler to beat people fast
2010-10-12T09:09:29  <antimatroid> i like to hand their asses to them

2010-10-12T09:09:46  <epona> what would you say is a perfect match then
2010-10-12T09:09:52  <epona> link?
2010-10-12T09:10:09  <edcba> it took a planet with gen = 1 at turn 143 with 64 neutral on it...
2010-10-12T09:11:07  <antimatroid> what?
2010-10-12T09:11:32  <edcba> cost to take the planet doesn't worth it anymore
2010-10-12T09:12:09  <epona> oh i see
2010-10-12T09:12:13  <antimatroid> oh, meh, without a defininitive answer on end conditions i'm assuming nothing

2010-10-12T09:22:16  <epona> yea but theres a 2 unit planet in the back
2010-10-12T09:22:24  <epona> if you send one ship of 2 off
2010-10-12T09:22:32  <epona> he has to relocate those further back
2010-10-12T09:22:39  <antimatroid> for which the opponent can send more than enough to counter in the time that it takes me to get there

2010-10-12T09:22:56  <epona> more than enough to counter = attack in the front

2010-10-12T10:57:04  <antimatroid> although the plans are there for an attempt at minimax approximation, just haven't got to time
2010-10-12T10:57:12  <bartwe_> i'm falling further and further out of the competition is seems :)
2010-10-12T10:57:33  <bartwe_> so the top spots have foudn a way to do 'real' search ?
2010-10-12T10:59:49  <delt0r_> bartwe_: Don;t think so
2010-10-12T11:00:04  <delt0r_> at lest thats not the impression i get from the comments
2010-10-12T11:00:05  <Naktibalda> it looks like small improvements can help a lot

2010-10-12T11:01:51  <HakanD> hehe, extra dropped out (:
2010-10-12T11:02:39  <Naktibalda> probable he submitted a new version
2010-10-12T11:02:59  <Naktibalda> probably
2010-10-12T11:02:59  <cfaftw> antimatroid, my bot is pure heuristics
2010-10-12T11:03:15  <cfaftw> naktibalda, no he didn't... he had a bad string of games
2010-10-12T11:07:37  <foucist> cfaftw: procedural heuristics? :P
2010-10-12T11:09:15  <mega1> what is pure heuristics? A 1-play search?
2010-10-12T11:09:33  <cfaftw> foucist, i don't know what procedural heuristics are -_-
2010-10-12T11:10:01  <amstan> rabidus: order does not matter that much as you go down
2010-10-12T11:10:07  <amstan> you don't care who's last or second last too much
2010-10-12T11:10:30  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm still just telling my bots to make decisions based off random bits of information i calculate
2010-10-12T11:10:34  <rabidus> i mean top10
2010-10-12T11:10:42  <antimatroid> but i'm getting a better idea of what works better
2010-10-12T11:10:43  <rabidus> i do care about top10 correct order

2010-10-12T11:12:59  <cfaftw> antimatroid, not right now... i haven't had time to work on my bot recently. and the one that is on the official server is kinda busted
2010-10-12T11:13:29  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2010-10-12T11:14:01  <cfaftw> i'm hoping to get a new version of my bot going by this weekend
2010-10-12T11:14:15  <cfaftw> and it might be significantly worse, but who knows :)
2010-10-12T11:15:03  <antimatroid> i have too many assignments to do much, just tweaking things playing around atm
2010-10-12T11:15:19  <JamesMG> I can't decide if mine got worse over last weekend or the competition on TCP got stiffer
2010-10-12T11:15:22  <antimatroid> i want to try some kind of minimax, but it's my last week of semester with 5 exams coming up soon

2010-10-12T11:15:55  <cfaftw> good

2010-10-12T11:36:41  <jmcarthur> it sounded to me like nobody knew about it
2010-10-12T11:37:02  <amstan> yeah, well.. nobody used because the main repo is not git
2010-10-12T11:37:15  <jmcarthur> no i mean it was supposed to be a switch from svn to git

2010-10-12T11:37:42  <jmcarthur> in the middle of things is probably a bad time
2010-10-12T11:37:45  <amstan> also.. try to make everything ai-challenge
2010-10-12T11:37:48  <amstan> instead of ai-contest
2010-10-12T11:38:01  <amstan> mega1: link?
2010-10-12T11:38:23  <mega1> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=130
2010-10-12T11:38:40  <Zannick> looks like my error, i'll fix it right now
2010-10-12T11:39:24  <janzert> after reading through the code I agree you had the right fix though mega1 :)
2010-10-12T11:39:41  <amstan> k, tell me when to update
2010-10-12T11:40:24  <mega1> it can't be any worse so we can try it
2010-10-12T11:40:48  <janzert> err, actually I'm not positive about the second line of your code. Does the lisp compiler never produce source + '.sbcl' files at all?
2010-10-12T11:40:55  <mega1> never
2010-10-12T11:41:01  <janzert> ahh, ok
2010-10-12T11:41:08  <mega1> compiles to ./MyBot
2010-10-12T11:41:14  <mega1> that's a binary
2010-10-12T11:41:29  <janzert> no intermediate files like C's *.o?
2010-10-12T11:41:37  <mega1> *.fasl
2010-10-12T11:41:55  <aerique> mega1: not in this case though?
2010-10-12T11:41:56  <mega1> but not necessarily in the root dir, is that a problem?
2010-10-12T11:42:20  <mega1> aerique: not in this case?
2010-10-12T11:42:45  <aerique> mega1: nevermind, i didn't consider your starter package which uses asdf
2010-10-12T11:43:06  <Zannick> so i'll just apply the patch given for now
2010-10-12T11:43:19  <mega1> ok
2010-10-12T11:43:27  <janzert> hmm, in practice I don't think it should be a real problem
2010-10-12T11:43:54  <mega1> what is the nukeglobs fields used for?
2010-10-12T11:43:54  <janzert> since it's not suppose to ever be compiling a changed submission
2010-10-12T11:44:28  <Zannick> amstan: it's in now
2010-10-12T11:44:34  <janzert> deletes those files before it starts compiling, I guess the problem would be if someone left them in the upload they sent to the server
2010-10-12T11:44:55  <jmcarthur> amstan: wait, so is this supposed to be ai-challenge or ai-contest? if it's supposed to be challenge, then why is the url ai-contest.com?
2010-10-12T11:45:02  <Zannick> that's to ensure you don't send binary or precompiled stuff with your submission
2010-10-12T11:45:24  <jmcarthur> :(
2010-10-12T11:45:30  <amstan> jmcarthur: it's supposed to be ai-challenge, jeff messed up and used contest in some places
2010-10-12T11:45:36  <jmcarthur> i still haven't heard an official decision on binaries
2010-10-12T11:45:47  <jmcarthur> just people saying it doesn't sound bad
2010-10-12T11:45:48  <amstan> i'm just dying here.. with the inconsistencies on the names
2010-10-12T11:46:06  <mega1> Zannick: I see. You cannot really enforce it. I just name it *.xxx and rename it when compiling.
2010-10-12T11:46:36  <Zannick> mega1: the server controls the compilation, how would you have it rename it?
2010-10-12T11:46:54  <jmcarthur> if you can rename it during compilation it's a security problem
2010-10-12T11:47:09  <jmcarthur> we had to disable a haskell feature for that reason
2010-10-12T11:47:10  <mega1> Zannick: common lisp has compile time evaluation
2010-10-12T11:47:19  <jmcarthur> yup, that's exactly what we had to disable
2010-10-12T11:47:25  <jmcarthur> amstan: ^^
2010-10-12T11:47:26  <mega1> you can't
2010-10-12T11:47:43  <amstan> mega1: we did for haskell
2010-10-12T11:48:01  <jmcarthur> mega1: when it looked like you couldn't for haskell jeff said things weren't looking good for haskell support. you might want to find a way to disable it :\
2010-10-12T11:48:04  <Zannick> there are a lot of arguments i don't understand in lisp's comp_args
2010-10-12T11:48:20  <jmcarthur> mega1: compilation isn't sandboxed
2010-10-12T11:49:19  <jmcarthur> amstan: do you know if these ec2 servers are set up the same way. is template haskell disabled on those?
2010-10-12T11:49:32  <jmcarthur> it's not really something that was every put in SVN or anything
2010-10-12T11:49:35  <jmcarthur> &ever
2010-10-12T11:49:58  <jmcarthur> does compilation even happen on those?
2010-10-12T11:50:03  <janzert> yes it does
2010-10-12T11:50:06  <amstan> i'm not sure
2010-10-12T11:50:13  <amstan> i don't think compilation happens on those
2010-10-12T11:50:21  <janzert> yeah it does
2010-10-12T11:50:38  <amstan> ok..
2010-10-12T11:50:40  * amstan has no idea
2010-10-12T11:51:20  <janzert> see tournament_manager.py in the cloud branch starting around line 67
2010-10-12T11:51:22  <jmcarthur> i'm dead if binaries won't be supported after all
2010-10-12T11:52:06  <janzert> also you can look at game_server_build.sh to see if whatever it is haskell needs setup actually is
2010-10-12T11:52:43  <Zannick> the commandline args on the sbcl man page all seem to be in use
2010-10-12T11:53:12  <Zannick> but yeah, it loads the bot code by evaluating it
2010-10-12T11:53:14  <Zannick> :(
2010-10-12T11:54:27  <mega1> we went throught the tron contest with basically the same setup

2010-10-12T12:15:28  <cfaftw> pgpaskar_, i feel ya... but it's actually how i found out about this contest
2010-10-12T12:15:44  <pgpaskar_> nice
2010-10-12T12:15:53  <pgpaskar_> Speaking of this contest I need to fix a bug
2010-10-12T12:16:02  <amstan> pgpaskar_: /r/minecraft
2010-10-12T12:16:15  <pgpaskar_> i dont play/own minecraft
2010-10-12T12:16:24  <amstan> pgpaskar_: you should
2010-10-12T12:16:30  <pgpaskar_> why
2010-10-12T12:16:34  <amstan> it's epic
2010-10-12T12:16:39  <pgpaskar_> jesus did everyone fork the entire repo for every branch
2010-10-12T12:16:42  <JamesMG> it's way too addictive
2010-10-12T12:16:42  <cfaftw> speaking of minecraft, my lunch break is coming up and those tunnels aren't going to dig themselves
2010-10-12T12:16:46  <pgpaskar_> this is going to be huge
2010-10-12T12:17:03  <pgpaskar_> at least symlink the static content
2010-10-12T12:17:06  <janzert> http://news.ycombinator.com/ it's a more targeted productivity vampire for programmers interested in startups :)
2010-10-12T12:17:20  <amstan> pgpaskar_: this is svn, there's no good way to use it
2010-10-12T12:17:22  <amstan> lol
2010-10-12T12:17:25  <pgpaskar_> fuck svn
2010-10-12T12:17:54  <Zannick> pgpaskar_: i stopped pulling branches awhile back because people did that
2010-10-12T12:18:00  <pgpaskar_> yeah
2010-10-12T12:18:04  <pgpaskar_> when this finished
2010-10-12T12:18:08  <Zannick> i've just been copying only the planet_wars/backend folder
2010-10-12T12:18:15  <pgpaskar_> im purging those branches from my copy
2010-10-12T12:18:24  <pgpaskar_> because this is ridiculous
2010-10-12T12:18:24  <janzert> yeah, the branch and fix workflow doesn't work anywhere near as well as with a dvcs
2010-10-12T12:18:30  <pgpaskar_> svn is downloading the same content hundreds of times
2010-10-12T12:18:38  <Zannick> if you cd to trunk and svn up from there, it'll ignore all the branches
2010-10-12T12:18:44  <amstan> yeah, idk why we're using this, lol
2010-10-12T12:18:45  <janzert> I deleted 26 branches the other day
2010-10-12T12:18:50  <Zannick> or you can specify
2010-10-12T12:18:51  <janzert> so it's much better now
2010-10-12T12:18:56  <Zannick> svn update trunk
2010-10-12T12:19:24  <janzert> only 10 left now :}
2010-10-12T12:19:36  <Zannick> you can probably blame jeff, who put in the instructions to copy the whole of trunk into the branch
2010-10-12T12:20:16  <amstan> pgpaskar_: i got office key technologies
2010-10-12T12:20:19  <amstan> so epic..
2010-10-12T12:20:31  <pgpaskar_> did ya
2010-10-12T12:20:38  <pgpaskar_> i didn't bother with that since i go home during classes now
2010-10-12T12:20:41  <pgpaskar_> 3 hrs is too long to afk in office
2010-10-12T12:21:01  <amstan> i have to busride for like 1 hour for now to get home
2010-10-12T12:21:08  <amstan> not worth it to make 2 trips per day
2010-10-12T12:21:14  <amstan> i'll get car technologies though
2010-10-12T12:21:50  <pgpaskar_> yeah
2010-10-12T12:21:57  <pgpaskar_> i walk back and forth its 30m each way
2010-10-12T12:22:10  <amstan> from the MC?
2010-10-12T12:22:11  <amstan> no way
2010-10-12T12:22:15  <pgpaskar_> perfect because inbetween class, assignments and being a tool on reddit its the only exercise i get -.-

2010-10-12T12:28:42  <pgpaskar_> does svn have a facility to diff a current rev folder with an older rev of another folder (for comparing branches to trunk) or do i have to write sh for this
2010-10-12T12:28:53  <amstan> probably
2010-10-12T12:29:00  <amstan> try svn diff

2010-10-12T14:27:56  <cfaftw> oh
2010-10-12T14:30:52  <bhasker_> python 4tw no compilation ^
2010-10-12T14:31:46  <bhasker_> are the bots really getting so much better on tcp
2010-10-12T14:31:53  <bhasker_> i see a lot of new bots
2010-10-12T14:31:56  <bhasker_> ripping it up
2010-10-12T14:31:58  <Zannick> no compilation is a two-edged blade
2010-10-12T14:32:14  <Zannick> but at least there are things like pychecker
2010-10-12T14:32:29  <bhasker_> well i test locally and on tcp
2010-10-12T14:32:42  <bhasker_> so most bugs that a compiler would catch are already caught and fixed
2010-10-12T14:32:59  <cfaftw> Zannick probably meant performance
2010-10-12T14:33:02  <Zannick> that's, uh, not the same
2010-10-12T14:33:15  <Zannick> no, i mean with regards to compile time errors
2010-10-12T14:33:16  <bhasker_> performance is an issue when oyu start running into timeouts
2010-10-12T14:33:19  <Zannick> like syntax
2010-10-12T14:33:26  <Zannick> or typoed variable names
2010-10-12T14:33:27  <bhasker_> hmm those aren't hard to fix?
2010-10-12T14:33:38  <bhasker_> if you have a reasonable test case
2010-10-12T14:33:44  <bhasker_> those should get caught
2010-10-12T14:33:53  <Zannick> no, but before i used pychecker i would only find those at runtime
2010-10-12T14:34:09  <Zannick> and they break everything so i have to restart
2010-10-12T14:34:35  <bhasker_> these bots aren't that complicated to run into such stuff
2010-10-12T14:34:36  <jmcarthur> runtime type checking can never replace static type checking
2010-10-12T14:34:56  <jmcarthur> static types *prove* properties about your code that runtime checks can only crap out on at unexpected times
2010-10-12T14:34:57  <Zannick> bhasker_: maybe not, but i'm talking about a different application, anyway
2010-10-12T14:35:16  <bhasker_> i agree with you jmc but for this app it doesn't really matter that much
2010-10-12T14:35:22  <jmcarthur> for the most part, you can get stuff done with runtime type checking, i agree
2010-10-12T14:35:36  <jmcarthur> but these static types have already saved my ass on a lot of points
2010-10-12T14:35:41  <jmcarthur> even in this contest
2010-10-12T14:36:22  <jmcarthur> and with a nice enough type system you can even approach "if it builds, it's correct", although i'm not really coding in a way suitable for that
2010-10-12T14:36:24  <bhasker_> i guess depends on how complicated your bot gets
2010-10-12T14:37:09  <bhasker_> anyways whats your bots name jmc? and are you running it on tcp?

2010-10-12T15:44:02  <rabidus> rsergio is very tough piece
2010-10-12T15:44:08  <jmcarthur> i guess that means bots are continuing to get better

2010-10-12T15:44:18  <chl> hello
2010-10-12T15:44:22  <jmcarthur> it depends on relation to ragebot maybe

2010-10-12T15:52:21  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-12T15:52:42  <amstan> these logs should pretty much give a history on who was in top

2010-10-12T16:18:23  <jmcarthur> weird that ceiling(NaN) gives that result though

2010-10-12T17:21:58  <janzert> yeah, that's what I'm afraid of unless j3camero happens to have an evening to spend here
2010-10-12T17:22:55  <jmcarthur> man i have so many constraints on my test data that i takes a really long time just to generate it all during my tests
2010-10-12T17:23:39  <jmcarthur> i'm generating not only valid maps, but valid game states (during like the middle of a virtual game) that could be plausibly reached during an actual game
2010-10-12T17:24:02  <Zannick> the elusive admin j3camero
2010-10-12T17:24:08  <janzert> I was thinking of changing the engine to truly wait for bot input instead of the busy loop it has now. But I'm really afraid to add any more changes than I already have
2010-10-12T17:25:02  <janzert> jmcarthur: hehe, yeah sounds intensive. Can't just produce and save them before hand?
2010-10-12T17:25:14  <janzert> then you know the same states are tested each time as well
2010-10-12T17:25:18  <jmcarthur> janzert: defeats the purpose to do that. i want to run it on new data every time i run the tests

2010-10-12T17:26:17  <janzert> just needs to have those threads signal the main thread
2010-10-12T17:26:26  <Zannick> hm, true
2010-10-12T17:26:32  <jmcarthur> or could use select

2010-10-12T17:27:52  <janzert> and is more portable code to boot, not that it matters :)
2010-10-12T17:27:54  <jmcarthur> janzert: anyway, i'm now restricting my maps to 255x255, and still trying to generate anywhere between 2 and 100 planets in them...
2010-10-12T17:28:02  <jmcarthur> think i might lower that to 50 instead of 100
2010-10-12T17:28:23  <janzert> yeah, might as well for testing at this point
2010-10-12T17:31:13  <Zannick> lol, are you preparing for the finals game Galaxy Wars which have hundreds of planets? :P

2010-10-12T17:33:20  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-12T17:34:13  <jmcarthur> really i should probably switch from quickcheck to smallcheck. most failures are for small cases anyway
2010-10-12T17:34:21  <jmcarthur> and smallcheck is much faster, to boot
2010-10-12T17:37:25  <janzert> uh oh, just noticed all the cloud servers are down :(
2010-10-12T17:39:10  <Zannick> i hear that happens every now and then, i think it's auto-cost balancing or something
2010-10-12T17:40:02  <janzert> yeah, it is but looking at gpm average for the last hour they've been down at least that long and the spot price for them was low during that time
2010-10-12T17:40:34  <Zannick> i don't know how it actually works
2010-10-12T17:40:43  <janzert> you can see current cost and history here btw http://cloudexchange.org/charts/us-east-1.linux.c1.medium.html
2010-10-12T17:41:50  <janzert> it did jump about about 3 minutes ago but was low before that
2010-10-12T17:42:15  <janzert> hopefully when it comes back down the automation will kick a few back on

2010-10-12T17:58:45  <jmcarthur> in fact i bet i know what it is

2010-10-12T18:01:54  <jmcarthur> yeah i could throw some asserts in...
2010-10-12T18:02:12  <janzert> why are you not using 32 bit ints for most everything? are you really that tight on memory
2010-10-12T18:02:19  <Zannick> the important thing to remember is not to have useful things in the assert
2010-10-12T18:02:31  <jmcarthur> janzert: not tight on memory, but tight on memory bandwidth
2010-10-12T18:02:40  <Zannick> i had assert(scanf(blah) == 6) or something
2010-10-12T18:02:52  <Zannick> which would have been really bad when the asserts were removed
2010-10-12T18:02:54  <janzert> ahh
2010-10-12T18:03:44  <janzert> have to admit it still smells a bit of premature optimization though :/
2010-10-12T18:04:00  <jmcarthur> i don't think that choosing a type is a premature optimization
2010-10-12T18:04:09  <jmcarthur> you have to choose it anyway
2010-10-12T18:04:15  <jmcarthur> might as well choose something appropriate
2010-10-12T18:04:38  <jmcarthur> and no, i *know* i will want this
2010-10-12T18:04:46  <janzert> choose the processor default, it can generally work with those fastest anyway :)
2010-10-12T18:04:47  <Zannick> well, with a turn limit, there's a strict upper bound on the number of ships

2010-10-12T18:20:26  <dmj111> cool.
2010-10-12T18:20:45  <McLeopold> I've been working on a tcp server myself.  I've been wanting to run asymetrical maps.
2010-10-12T18:20:52  <dmj111> ahh, fun.
2010-10-12T18:21:17  <dmj111> I will try to keep this from being yet another unfinished project, and at least draw up some of the design.
2010-10-12T18:21:18  <McLeopold> It seems like you could modify the tcp client to be able to request an opponent.
2010-10-12T18:21:37  <McLeopold> The match-maker could wait for that connection and then pair them up.
2010-10-12T18:21:46  <dmj111> probably.  I don't want to request extra stuff from dhartmei since his stuff is so helpful as it is :)
2010-10-12T18:22:09  <McLeopold> It would be nice if we had a python implementation. :)
2010-10-12T18:22:11  <Zannick> you'd want to pair them and run the games from each perspective
2010-10-12T18:22:25  <dmj111> McLeopold: what you suggest is probably much easier than my idea.  I was looking at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme to make it fair.
2010-10-12T18:22:52  <dmj111> McLeopold: I am going working on a python implementation, for several reasons.
2010-10-12T18:23:01  <JamesMG> dmj111: It would be nice to let people leave their bots "available" for games too
2010-10-12T18:23:07  <McLeopold> If you put it on github, I will help.
2010-10-12T18:23:25  <dmj111> McLeopold: as a python guy, I figured it would be bitbucket :)
2010-10-12T18:23:28  <McLeopold> JamesMG: that's a great idea!
2010-10-12T18:23:39  <Zannick> i use bitbucket :)
2010-10-12T18:23:41  <JamesMG> so I could play against some of the top bots :)

2010-10-12T18:26:24  <McLeopold> It only waits a few seconds for the best matchup.  It needs to wait longer.

2010-10-12T18:26:51  <dmj111> well, I'll check back in later.
2010-10-12T18:27:09  <McLeopold> If my timer is 3 minutes, then anyone that wants to play me would want to connect and wait that long to see if I would come back.

2010-10-12T19:00:23  <Zannick> i would rather have it in a file so it is easy to view and edit
2010-10-12T19:00:37  <Zannick> but i'd rather fix the cloud race first

2010-10-12T20:32:44  <Naktibalda> janzert: is schema.sql in repository out of date?
2010-10-12T20:32:47  <janzert> Zannick: rough draft here http://pastebin.org/161642 having a bit of a hard time actually testing it locally since the schema in svn is outdated
2010-10-12T20:32:57  <janzert> Naktibalda: yes, has been for quite a while
2010-10-12T20:33:28  <Naktibalda> you should ask amstan to commit new schema :)
2010-10-12T20:33:59  <janzert> I know that he doesn't want to have to deal with svn and the code at all
2010-10-12T20:34:46  <janzert> If amstan can give it to us though that'll work for the moment
2010-10-12T20:35:53  <Naktibalda> that's why svn is out of date

2010-10-12T20:38:34  * Naktibalda bets on No
2010-10-12T20:38:42  <amstan> i wrote my code using cin>>, but i have some cases where instead of stdin, i need to use a file
2010-10-12T20:38:57  <amstan> i tried something like cin=ifstream in("filename");
2010-10-12T20:40:36  <janzert> my tron entry is about the most I've used it, so not really :}
2010-10-12T20:41:11  <janzert> and really I just use it like C+objects
2010-10-12T20:44:11  <pjreddie> any admins on that can check logs, i'd really appreciate some help figuring out what happened in http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5811957 this game
2010-10-12T20:45:11  <janzert> pjreddie: there aren't any logs, at least not like specific game logs besides what is sent to the visualizer
2010-10-12T20:46:07  <pjreddie> oh. damn. well then. anyone got any idea why a bot could sometimes fail on the first turn, and sometimes be fine?
2010-10-12T20:46:25  <greghaynes> amstan: theres a couple solutions
2010-10-12T20:46:31  <pjreddie> because that's the situation i've been trying to figure out for a while
2010-10-12T20:46:47  <amstan> greghaynes: ok.. so.. i'm trying pointers now, ifstream *input;
2010-10-12T20:46:54  <greghaynes> amstan: Do you have a bunch of cin code you dont want to have to change?
2010-10-12T20:46:55  <amstan> then doing !*input.eof()
2010-10-12T20:46:57  <amstan> but it doesn't like it
2010-10-12T20:47:00  <amstan> greghaynes: sure..
2010-10-12T20:47:08  <amstan> if i could just override cin that would be nice
2010-10-12T20:47:25  <greghaynes> Yea, just dup2 the stdin fd to a file
2010-10-12T20:47:25  <pjreddie> find and replace cin with an fstream
2010-10-12T20:47:44  <greghaynes> Its the same way people do logging in C

2010-10-12T20:50:38  <greghaynes> What im saying is, dont use the c++ api, cin just calls read(1...) way down the line so if you dup2 so that fd 1 is pointing to a file you open then ill read from that file
2010-10-12T20:50:49  <greghaynes> It will take a bit of reasearch, I cant code it off the top of my head

2010-10-12T22:42:33  <decipher> i need some debugging help i went through my code a million times and i think its flawless but yet sometimes before i win or midgame i crash, 50 percent i win 50 percent i crash
2010-10-12T22:43:56  <decipher> im pretty good at programming in java and i am at the point of max frustration, i can't see it
2010-10-12T22:45:19  <iwantorganizatio> did you try it locally (with mass testing against all example bots and itself on all maps?)
2010-10-12T22:45:46  <dmj111> ahhh... java.... i might not be much help there.   but iwantorganizatio has a good question...
2010-10-12T22:45:52  <decipher> i only test it locally i havent uploaded it yet i want to finish everything on my checklist
2010-10-12T22:46:22  <decipher> i only tried it on two maps but regardless that enough information to trace my variables and see what input/output mismatch im having but its all connecting perfectly
2010-10-12T22:46:39  <iwantorganizatio> ok java... so what exception do you get?
2010-10-12T22:47:14  <dmj111> i use a lot of logging in my code.  when i run into a trouble position, i grab the input that happened before the error, and send it back through my code to look at the problem.
2010-10-12T22:47:18  <decipher> just says player 1 wins but the visualizer shows my guys for lets say 30 turns and boom i dissapear
2010-10-12T22:47:28  <decipher> me too
2010-10-12T22:47:45  <decipher> i write to file after every node i create on my game tree.. and after every actual decision
2010-10-12T22:48:00  <decipher> but its hard to get the actual error i get no server log
2010-10-12T22:48:08  <dmj111> are you logging the shots you fire?  there are several ways that could go bad.
2010-10-12T22:48:16  <decipher> shots fired?
2010-10-12T22:48:19  <iwantorganizatio> do you get stderr of your bot?
2010-10-12T22:48:20  <decipher> i thought it was just planes
2010-10-12T22:48:23  <dmj111> launching fleets?
2010-10-12T22:48:41  <iwantorganizatio> ie. do you see error stream?
2010-10-12T22:48:44  <decipher> im using java isnt stderr c?
2010-10-12T22:49:01  <decipher> no
2010-10-12T22:49:15  <iwantorganizatio> what version of PlayGame.jar are you using?
2010-10-12T22:49:17  <decipher> i dont see any error like it just shows all my turns and that after an arbitrary turn its crashes
2010-10-12T22:49:22  <decipher> hmm let me check
2010-10-12T22:49:30  <iwantorganizatio> did you update PlayGame.jar to the one that shows error stream of bot?
2010-10-12T22:49:49  <decipher> i dont think so
2010-10-12T22:49:51  <iwantorganizatio> i found bugs near impossible to find without the upgrad
2010-10-12T22:50:15  <decipher> yeah because how do you know where it crashes you write files for so long and boom no files but you still need teh actuall error
2010-10-12T22:50:51  <decipher> how do you know what version it is

2010-10-12T23:00:52  <iwantorganizatio> an exception should've been printed there, not sure why you don't see it

2010-10-12T23:01:04  <iwantorganizatio> oh
2010-10-12T23:01:12  <iwantorganizatio> default code
2010-10-12T23:01:17  <iwantorganizatio> catches all exceptions
2010-10-12T23:01:24  <iwantorganizatio> make sure you disable that
2010-10-12T23:01:42  <iwantorganizatio> otherwise, your bot will quit silently whenever there's an exception
2010-10-12T23:01:47  <decipher> oh ok
2010-10-12T23:01:50  <decipher> how do i do that
2010-10-12T23:01:57  <decipher> btw i might of just kinda fixed it which is weird
2010-10-12T23:01:59  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@202.129.235.53> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-12T23:02:08  <amstan> there's an except clause somewhere
2010-10-12T23:02:10  <amstan> where it just passes
2010-10-12T23:02:16  <decipher> it was my debugging to a file that was actually crashing it because i fixed the problem but i guess the file was still messing it up
2010-10-12T23:02:23  <decipher> in my code
2010-10-12T23:02:26  <iwantorganizatio> there should be a "try { ... } catch (Exception e) { } inside MyBot.java
2010-10-12T23:02:27  <decipher> or planetwars
2010-10-12T23:02:31  <decipher> oh ok
2010-10-12T23:02:35  <decipher> yeah i have lots of those
2010-10-12T23:02:55  <iwantorganizatio> the problem with using Exception is that it's the base class for all exceptions
2010-10-12T23:02:56  <decipher> i shoudl just get a string or something instead of catching e im a idiot
2010-10-12T23:03:03  <decipher> yeah i forgot that
2010-10-12T23:03:06  <decipher> INHERITANCE
2010-10-12T23:03:07  <decipher> !
2010-10-12T23:03:59  <decipher>  } catch (Exception e)
2010-10-12T23:04:04  <decipher> this is at teh end of my main method?
2010-10-12T23:04:07  <decipher> this was there by default
2010-10-12T23:04:14  <iwantorganizatio> yes i think thats it
2010-10-12T23:04:16  <decipher> is this the problem?
2010-10-12T23:04:18  <decipher> ok
2010-10-12T23:04:23  <iwantorganizatio> thats why it doesnt print errors messages
2010-10-12T23:04:23  <decipher> can i simply remove it
2010-10-12T23:04:34  <decipher> no theres  a try
2010-10-12T23:04:35  <iwantorganizatio> yeah assuming you remove try { } as wlel
2010-10-12T23:04:39  <decipher> yeah

2010-10-12T23:05:47  <decipher> dont i need the try becuase theres some kinda readline crap by default
2010-10-12T23:05:52  <iwantorganizatio> not sure why it's there, it's in a position where it doesn't even recover errors
2010-10-12T23:05:54  <decipher> im sure to use teh buffer you need try
2010-10-12T23:06:06  <iwantorganizatio> it should be enough with catch IOException
2010-10-12T23:06:18  <decipher> yeah the error catching dum
2010-10-12T23:06:19  <iwantorganizatio> that means only IOException will be caught (rather than everything)
2010-10-12T23:06:56  <decipher> very good point
2010-10-12T23:07:08  <decipher> waterloo kids are suppose to be the brightest!
2010-10-12T23:07:14  <decipher> lol
2010-10-12T23:07:32  <iwantorganizatio> ^^
2010-10-12T23:07:32  <decipher> jk hope your not from there aha
2010-10-12T23:07:37  <iwantorganizatio> no ;)
2010-10-12T23:07:55  <iwantorganizatio> sweden.
2010-10-12T23:08:05  <decipher> oh very nice
2010-10-12T23:08:15  <decipher> im in canada an hour away from waterloo

2010-10-12T23:10:19  <decipher> lol
2010-10-12T23:10:25  <decipher> its to addicting
2010-10-12T23:10:33  <decipher> man my game crahsed silently again
2010-10-12T23:10:39  <decipher> catch (IOException e) is the only catch i use
2010-10-12T23:10:42  <decipher> which is in the mian
2010-10-12T23:10:46  <iwantorganizatio> hmmm
2010-10-12T23:10:54  <decipher> i won 7 games in a row switched maps first game silent crash
2010-10-12T23:11:48  <iwantorganizatio> so no other catch(Exception) anywhere else I hope. might for some reason be an IOException ofc but I suppose you could print something to find out
2010-10-12T23:12:09  <iwantorganizatio> also sometimes i forget System.exit clauses that i used for testing in my code causing similar behaviour
2010-10-12T23:12:21  <pgpaskar_> top bot is java
2010-10-12T23:12:26  <pgpaskar_> All those hating: theory disproven
2010-10-12T23:12:26  <pgpaskar_> XD
2010-10-12T23:13:23  <iwantorganizatio> all about picking right language for the problem.. java is very suitable for this imo
2010-10-12T23:13:39  <decipher> yeah you need oop for ai imo
2010-10-12T23:13:46  <decipher> its easier

2010-10-12T23:14:54  <iwantorganizatio> im not using any oop in this assignment, my java code is like C... :p
2010-10-12T23:15:09  <Azrathud> Would you ever run over the 1 second turn limit using Java?
2010-10-12T23:15:21  <decipher> hmm no exceptions besides the one for planetwars where it parses file and one in my main in mybot that uses ioexception is there something else in tehre i can put that does absouletly nothing ahha
2010-10-12T23:15:30  <sigh> Azrathud: depends what you are doing, like in any language
2010-10-12T23:15:41  <decipher> are you getting around java and using pointers?
2010-10-12T23:15:46  <Azrathud> Sorry, I mean for this Ai Challenge.
2010-10-12T23:15:58  <sigh> Azrathud: again, depends what you are doing :P
2010-10-12T23:16:32  <sigh> some approaches take a lot of time, some are quick... in the end the algorithm matters more than the language
2010-10-12T23:16:35  <Azrathud> Ah. I haven't had much experience with Java but I would probably use pointers if I could.
2010-10-12T23:16:38  <iwantorganizatio> just have 1 class with a bunch of "globals" (fields) and "functions" (private methods). either way performance is not the issue for this
2010-10-12T23:16:56  <sigh> errr... pointers in java? wtf?
2010-10-12T23:16:57  <Azrathud> , but*
2010-10-12T23:17:05  <decipher> yeah thers a way youc an use it
2010-10-12T23:17:09  <decipher> some hack
2010-10-12T23:17:12  <iwantorganizatio> :x
2010-10-12T23:17:23  <iwantorganizatio> no i dont use pointers anyway, why would i ;)
2010-10-12T23:17:24  <sigh> news to me o_O
2010-10-12T23:17:26  <decipher> where you can get the pointers of an object becuase everything in java is abstract
2010-10-12T23:17:38  <decipher> i heard this through the wind pipe thou but i believe it
2010-10-12T23:17:53  <iwantorganizatio> even in c++ i use refs in preference to pointers, nicer semantics
2010-10-12T23:17:58  <decipher> honestly computers are effecient anyways lol
2010-10-12T23:18:18  <iwantorganizatio> what imeant is i participated in an ai competition for checkers where performance did matter
2010-10-12T23:18:34  <decipher> thats intense
2010-10-12T23:18:42  <iwantorganizatio> i won that one in java anyhow in competition with ais coded in C
2010-10-12T23:18:44  <decipher> you would need c++ imo
2010-10-12T23:18:53  <decipher> really wow
2010-10-12T23:19:18  <sigh> algorithm matters a lot more than language
2010-10-12T23:19:20  <iwantorganizatio> ai code using a lot of control instructions, not a lot of arithmetic
2010-10-12T23:19:28  <iwantorganizatio> yes that too
2010-10-12T23:19:53  <decipher> obviously my greedy algorithm not going to matter what language i write it in :P
2010-10-12T23:19:59  <sigh> :)
2010-10-12T23:19:59  <iwantorganizatio> which was another point, algorithms used in this case cannot yield significantly better results with more cpu time
2010-10-12T23:20:14  <sigh> in what case?
2010-10-12T23:20:17  <decipher> complexity
2010-10-12T23:20:22  <iwantorganizatio> there's not iterative deepening for instance (or well, im not aware of anyone using it)
2010-10-12T23:20:45  <sigh> there a lot of things you can do that requires a lot of computation
2010-10-12T23:20:47  <decipher> dont the algorithms time complexity really all that matters
2010-10-12T23:21:14  <sigh> for example McLeopold was complaining that one of his bots was taking 2-3 per move, and that was when he was attempting to optimise expansion
2010-10-12T23:21:15  <iwantorganizatio> in chessp rogramming it can matter because everyone uses same algo ^^
2010-10-12T23:21:16  <decipher> actually its a mix
2010-10-12T23:21:30  <decipher> yeah
2010-10-12T23:21:50  <decipher> both time and the actual algorithm too because i bet people are doing a bunch of min max trees like me
2010-10-12T23:21:59  <decipher> mine slightly more complicated
2010-10-12T23:22:14  <iwantorganizatio> you're using min max in this?
2010-10-12T23:22:15  <sigh> decipher: you are using minimax?
2010-10-12T23:22:28  <sigh> I don't think many people are... yet
2010-10-12T23:22:33  <decipher> kinda hyrbit
2010-10-12T23:22:36  <decipher> hybrid
2010-10-12T23:22:38  <sigh> I'm working on it, but it is hard
2010-10-12T23:22:45  <decipher> i have alpha beta pruning hopefully coming soon
2010-10-12T23:23:00  <decipher> having a good evaluation function all that matters
2010-10-12T23:23:19  <sigh> how deep are you going, and what branching factor?
2010-10-12T23:23:20  <decipher> and how you go up the tree and the depth is good for this problem
2010-10-12T23:23:21  <iwantorganizatio> so what can of branching factor do you get?
2010-10-12T23:24:14  <iwantorganizatio> i discredited minimax because i thought it'd be unsuitable for this due to high branching factor :x
2010-10-12T23:24:38  <decipher> im debugging the first ply which = 1 but once thats correct all i have to do is change the ply to lets say 6 and depending how fast i can prune the tree in a second will show how deep i go
2010-10-12T23:25:02  <sigh> iwantorganizatio: obviously you can't test all possible allocation of orders... you have to set your moves are a higher level
2010-10-12T23:25:21  <decipher> i always assume obv the player will pick the best move
2010-10-12T23:25:36  <decipher> but alpha beta goes further then that
2010-10-12T23:25:39  <iwantorganizatio> well yes, that's a given
2010-10-12T23:25:46  <sigh> decipher: so what branching factor?
2010-10-12T23:26:03  <decipher> sorry what do you mean by branching factor i might use a different term?
2010-10-12T23:26:21  <sigh> how many moves do you analyse for a given state?
2010-10-12T23:26:24  <iwantorganizatio> how many leafs per node
2010-10-12T23:26:42  <decipher> oh children
2010-10-12T23:26:44  <sigh> yup
2010-10-12T23:26:55  <decipher> ahaha
2010-10-12T23:26:58  <decipher> thats the secret
2010-10-12T23:27:02  <decipher> :P
2010-10-12T23:27:16  <decipher> it changes based on every turn
2010-10-12T23:27:28  <sigh> awww, no ball park, figure? ~10, ~100, ~1000, ~10000?
2010-10-12T23:27:43  <decipher> oh i thoguht you wanted to know how i do the leafs
2010-10-12T23:27:51  <decipher> for my function at first its rufly 100 ish
2010-10-12T23:27:52  <iwantorganizatio> nah just the number of them
2010-10-12T23:28:02  <decipher> but as i go futher down im sure it will increase
2010-10-12T23:28:13  <sigh> yeah, 100 is reasonable
2010-10-12T23:28:15  <iwantorganizatio> 100^6
2010-10-12T23:28:26  <sigh> but yeah, 6ply is out of the question
2010-10-12T23:28:27  <decipher> i think its n ^ n max leafs
2010-10-12T23:28:34  <decipher> but thats unrealistic
2010-10-12T23:28:37  <decipher> no n-1
2010-10-12T23:28:45  <iwantorganizatio> 100(6/2) with bruning
2010-10-12T23:28:49  <iwantorganizatio> pruning*
2010-10-12T23:28:56  <iwantorganizatio> optimal pruning i think
2010-10-12T23:29:08  <iwantorganizatio> 100^(6/2)***
2010-10-12T23:29:09  <decipher> my first choice was a neural network but school keeps me too busy
2010-10-12T23:29:57  <decipher> simple vanilla backprobagation and use all the training examples online to train it to 95 percent memorization
2010-10-12T23:30:07  <decipher> :D
2010-10-12T23:30:54  <decipher> how hard do you think it will be to crack top 100?
2010-10-12T23:30:58  <decipher> i havent uploaded yet
2010-10-12T23:31:28  <iwantorganizatio> i reached 250-300 with a dumb aggresive bot, havent improved much after adding defense
2010-10-12T23:31:33  <rwa> not long ago, it was easy.  getting harder.
2010-10-12T23:31:57  <decipher> man i just had a weird crash
2010-10-12T23:32:48  <decipher> the enemy had no planets just a random fleet floating at 21 i had no more fleets sent enemy last planet was destroyed, but i still had fleets in the air, and it said he won? my peices dissapear
2010-10-12T23:33:15  <iwantorganizatio> illegal move or bot just quit
2010-10-12T23:33:39  <decipher> i make no more moves after pw.enemyplanet().size < 1
2010-10-12T23:33:57  <decipher> or only make the move when its > 0 is my actual syntax
