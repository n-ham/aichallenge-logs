2012-08-31T12:34:33  <UncleVasya> Just logic, don't wanna to mess up with gui or network.
2012-08-31T12:35:09  <mcstar> no, im asking, if you are playing the game and reading the book at the same time
2012-08-31T12:35:16  <UncleVasya> 5 mins of reading, 5 hource of gaming :D
2012-08-31T12:35:21  <mcstar> oh

2012-08-31T12:35:37  <UncleVasya> no multitasking :(
2012-08-31T12:36:26  <UncleVasya> the game I used to play in childhood with guys in the street.
2012-08-31T12:38:29  <UncleVasya> I can try to explain rules if you interested
2012-08-31T12:38:44  <mcstar> are you making an ai, to play the game against you?
2012-08-31T12:38:49  <UncleVasya> or you'll see when I'll give it to you to play :)
2012-08-31T12:39:25  <UncleVasya> I don't know yet, I need to write a game implementation before it.
2012-08-31T12:39:43  <UncleVasya> I didn't coded anything yet.
2012-08-31T12:40:17  <UncleVasya> And didn't think about the problem. Just have a little idea

2012-08-31T13:04:21  <antimatroidl> friend talked me into that over ubuntu again
2012-08-31T13:04:30  <mcstar> lol silly friend
2012-08-31T13:04:34  <mcstar> you dont want debian
2012-08-31T13:04:51  <antimatroidl> it's 3am atm anyway, will worry about that tomorrow
2012-08-31T13:04:51  <mcstar> antimatroidl: 'wont even pick up' what does that mean?
2012-08-31T13:05:00  <antimatroidl> it means i think the drive shat itself
2012-08-31T13:05:17  <mcstar> no, i mean, why do you think what you think
2012-08-31T13:05:25  <mcstar> what are the signs?
2012-08-31T13:05:27  <antimatroidl> when it books without a cd it demands one and with the cd it can't find any disk drives
2012-08-31T13:05:56  <mcstar> it cant boot from hdd, thats ok
2012-08-31T13:06:13  <mcstar> theres nothing wrong with your drive, your boot record is messed probably, thats an easy fix
2012-08-31T13:06:20  <mcstar> messed up*
2012-08-31T13:06:24  <antimatroidl> oh really?
2012-08-31T13:06:27  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-31T13:06:34  <mcstar> you just failed at installing debian
2012-08-31T13:06:49  <antimatroidl> hmm, let me plug stuff in in my room and i'll have a quick play
2012-08-31T13:06:58  <antimatroidl> i had to move it out to where the router was to install
2012-08-31T13:07:05  <antimatroidl> total pita :P
2012-08-31T13:07:12  <UncleVasya> antimatroidl: yeah, some mbr fixer might help you
2012-08-31T13:07:22  <mcstar> UncleVasya: no, this is not windows
2012-08-31T13:07:27  <mcstar> you dont need an mbr fixer
2012-08-31T13:07:34  <mcstar> just reinstall grub
2012-08-31T13:07:40  <mcstar> or install it, if you didnt
2012-08-31T13:07:42  <UncleVasya> mcstar: ok, you are in control
2012-08-31T13:09:16  <antimatroidl> hey grub loaded that time
2012-08-31T13:09:20  <antimatroidl> i told it to go to recovery
2012-08-31T13:09:36  <antimatroidl> still doing stuff now
2012-08-31T13:10:45  <antimatroidl> mcstar: k, i'm at your command
2012-08-31T13:11:10  <antimatroidl> it comes up with something like "INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/getty""
2012-08-31T13:11:23  <antimatroidl> got the same problem before when i didn't go into recovery
2012-08-31T13:12:12  <antimatroidl> it took the debian installer like 5 minutes alone just to detect my network hardware too which was a pita
2012-08-31T13:16:56  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i was having dinner
2012-08-31T13:17:23  <mcstar> so, what system are you booted in now?
2012-08-31T13:17:33  <mcstar> the cd installer or the installed one?
2012-08-31T13:18:12  *** kilae <kilae!~chatzilla@109.205.205.99> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.88.2 [Firefox 15.0/20120824154833])
2012-08-31T13:18:32  <antimatroidl> here?
2012-08-31T13:18:34  <antimatroidl> this is on my laptop
2012-08-31T13:18:46  <antimatroidl> just the installed one on my desktop
2012-08-31T13:21:06  <antimatroidl> i took the installation cd out
2012-08-31T13:21:54  <mcstar> antimatroidl: no, not here
2012-08-31T13:22:19  <mcstar> ok, so you cant boot the system, on the desktop
2012-08-31T13:22:29  <antimatroidl> nope
2012-08-31T13:22:30  <mcstar> bios says, cannot find boot somehthing?
2012-08-31T13:22:57  <mcstar> well, you have to boot that machine from the install cd
2012-08-31T13:23:07  <mcstar> but first, i want to ask something
2012-08-31T13:23:18  <mcstar> how did you proceed with the installation of debian?
2012-08-31T13:23:27  <mcstar> did everything go without error?
2012-08-31T13:23:31  <antimatroidl> did the graphical install
2012-08-31T13:23:42  <antimatroidl> i thought it went without error, it said successfully installed
2012-08-31T13:23:49  <antimatroidl> then when i rebooted, no love
2012-08-31T13:23:58  <mcstar> what about the bootloader installation phase?
2012-08-31T13:24:08  <mcstar> do you remember installing grub?
2012-08-31T13:24:08  <antimatroidl> i don't really know what that is?
2012-08-31T13:24:16  <antimatroidl> vaguely at the end
2012-08-31T13:24:18  <mcstar> grub is the usual linux boot loader
2012-08-31T13:24:20  <antimatroidl> not much was involved
2012-08-31T13:24:28  <mcstar> you selected the drive, and done?
2012-08-31T13:24:40  <antimatroidl> even that i'm not sure about
2012-08-31T13:24:53  <antimatroidl> i was tired at the time, it's 3:23am now, but i slept for a while since before
2012-08-31T13:25:04  <mcstar> (im not familiar with the current debian installer, i dont know how automated it is)
2012-08-31T13:25:16  <antimatroidl> i didn't have to do much
2012-08-31T13:25:28  <antimatroidl> other than type in usernames etc.
2012-08-31T13:25:32  <mcstar> how many phyisical drives do you have in that machine?
2012-08-31T13:25:35  <antimatroidl> 1
2012-08-31T13:25:42  <antimatroidl> and i formatted it all into one partition
2012-08-31T13:26:04  <mcstar> you usually want 3
2012-08-31T13:26:11  <antimatroidl> why?
2012-08-31T13:26:24  <antimatroidl> it gave me that as an option, just install everything on one partition
2012-08-31T13:26:29  <mcstar> or 4
2012-08-31T13:26:38  <mcstar> system, home, boot, swap
2012-08-31T13:27:13  <mcstar> well, it can be done with 1
2012-08-31T13:27:24  <mcstar> but then you either lose swap space
2012-08-31T13:27:29  <mcstar> or you set up a swap file
2012-08-31T13:27:34  <mcstar> but that will complicate hibernation
2012-08-31T13:27:45  <mcstar> its a bit more trouble to set up hibernation to a swap file
2012-08-31T13:28:03  <antimatroidl> hmmm
2012-08-31T13:28:07  <mcstar> and it is a good idea to have different boot/system/home partitions
2012-08-31T13:28:22  <mcstar> makes it easier to migrate the system...
2012-08-31T13:28:26  <antimatroidl> by the time i get around to fixing stuff it's a good idea to nuke and start fresh
2012-08-31T13:28:32  <mcstar> and you can use a modern filesystem on your home
2012-08-31T13:28:36  <mcstar> and have ext2 as boot
2012-08-31T13:29:17  <mcstar> antimatroidl: did  you change bios settings?
2012-08-31T13:29:23  <antimatroidl> nope
2012-08-31T13:29:34  <antimatroidl> maybe i should just download ubuntu again tomorrow?
2012-08-31T13:29:38  <mcstar> ok, so the bios still tries to boot from hdd first
2012-08-31T13:30:00  <antimatroidl> i'm shaped at home untill monday but i can go into uni and download files
2012-08-31T13:30:00  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you can boot from the install cd, but dont proceed with the installaion
2012-08-31T13:30:10  <mcstar> but use a shell, to see whats the problem
2012-08-31T13:30:14  <antimatroidl> k
2012-08-31T13:30:19  <mcstar> you could try to reinstall grub from that
2012-08-31T13:30:30  <mcstar> it is really trivial if you have done it
2012-08-31T13:30:35  <mcstar> but not otherwise
2012-08-31T13:30:47  <mcstar> antimatroidl: but i dont think you should be using debian
2012-08-31T13:30:58  <mcstar> go with the latest ubuntu, if you dont like arch
2012-08-31T13:31:16  <mcstar> btw, you can install these from pendrive
2012-08-31T13:31:18  <antimatroidl> my friend tried installing arch two days ago
2012-08-31T13:31:20  <antimatroidl> he failed aha
2012-08-31T13:31:21  <mcstar> you dont need to write a cd
2012-08-31T13:31:35  <antimatroidl> that would require me to have a usb drive
2012-08-31T13:31:44  <mcstar> you dont have one?
2012-08-31T13:31:44  <antimatroidl> i have plenty of old blank cds
2012-08-31T13:31:47  <antimatroidl> nope
2012-08-31T13:31:47  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-31T13:32:07  <mcstar> i installed win7 and osx from pendrive too
2012-08-31T13:32:13  <mcstar> much better than cds imho
2012-08-31T13:32:16  <antimatroidl> how do i boot from the cd? i have rescue mode? but when i tried to open that up before it seemed to hang somewhere
2012-08-31T13:32:47  <antimatroidl> i think it might be worth just putting this one down as a fail
2012-08-31T13:32:51  <antimatroidl> rather than trying to correct it
2012-08-31T13:32:52  <mcstar> well, you can actually boot to the installer
2012-08-31T13:33:00  <mcstar> but switch to a console
2012-08-31T13:33:15  <mcstar> yeah, i wouldnt bother
2012-08-31T13:33:35  <mcstar> antimatroidl: what went wrong with arch?
2012-08-31T13:33:41  <antimatroidl> not sure
2012-08-31T13:33:53  <antimatroidl> might have just been too much effort in the end
2012-08-31T13:34:18  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you have to configure the system the way you like
2012-08-31T13:34:28  <mcstar> it is not as trivial as a ubuntu install
2012-08-31T13:34:39  <antimatroidl> yeah he has played around with linux stuff more than me
2012-08-31T13:34:45  <antimatroidl> he's the one off to cambridge in a month
2012-08-31T13:35:05  <mcstar> antimatroidl: maybe he will pick up some linux skill there, eh?
2012-08-31T13:35:10  <antimatroidl> :P
2012-08-31T13:35:20  <antimatroidl> doubtful, he's doing masters in pure maths
2012-08-31T13:37:14  <antimatroidl> i'm also trying to write a search algorithm on a hypergraph on the integer lattice 3xn
2012-08-31T13:37:19  <antimatroidl> which is a pita
2012-08-31T13:37:27  <mcstar> oh?
2012-08-31T13:37:27  <antimatroidl> cause i have the nodes in each row named the same
2012-08-31T13:39:39  <antimatroidl> ?
2012-08-31T13:39:43  <mcstar> ?
2012-08-31T13:39:47  <mcstar> what?
2012-08-31T13:39:53  <antimatroidl> you put a question mark
2012-08-31T13:39:58  <antimatroidl> what was your question?
2012-08-31T13:39:59  <mcstar> oh?
2012-08-31T13:40:07  <antimatroidl> clarify?
2012-08-31T13:40:17  <mcstar> i was wondering what is a pita about that search
2012-08-31T13:40:22  <mcstar> and then you told me
2012-08-31T13:40:32  <mcstar> though, i dont think i actually see the problem
2012-08-31T13:40:44  <mcstar> what rows, btw?
2012-08-31T13:40:51  *** CIA-41 <CIA-41!cia@cia.vc> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2012-08-31T13:41:29  <antimatroidl> it's those diagrams for my thesis
2012-08-31T13:41:44  <mcstar> yeah, but 3xn is a line
2012-08-31T13:41:57  <antimatroidl> nah, {1,2,3}x{1,...,n}
2012-08-31T13:42:04  <mcstar> aha
2012-08-31T13:42:05  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-31T13:42:22  <antimatroidl> so the first diagram is in the top rectangle and the second in the bottom
2012-08-31T13:42:27  <mcstar> {1,2,3}xn then
2012-08-31T13:42:37  <antimatroidl> no
2012-08-31T13:42:42  <mcstar> N
2012-08-31T13:42:49  <antimatroidl> where N = {1,...,n}
2012-08-31T13:43:07  <mcstar> yeah, descartes product of {1,2,3} and N
2012-08-31T13:43:15  <antimatroidl> cartesian
2012-08-31T13:43:20  <mcstar> thats the same
2012-08-31T13:43:27  <antimatroidl> well i know it as cartesian
2012-08-31T13:43:34  <mcstar> yeah, its the same
2012-08-31T13:44:20  <antimatroidl> it should work okay
2012-08-31T13:44:26  <antimatroidl> i just need to work out how to most cleanly do it
2012-08-31T13:44:55  <antimatroidl> c++0x doesn't just work on osx either
2012-08-31T13:45:00  <antimatroidl> boo for osx
2012-08-31T13:45:14  <mcstar> depends which compiler you use
2012-08-31T13:45:25  <antimatroidl> normally just gcc
2012-08-31T13:45:28  <antimatroidl> i think
2012-08-31T13:45:39  <antimatroidl> i don't want to have to worry about that kind of stuff :P
2012-08-31T13:45:44  <mcstar> yeah, but you can have different from the installed one
2012-08-31T13:45:53  <mcstar> and you can have clang too
2012-08-31T13:45:57  <antimatroidl> why would osx have a shit one installed?
2012-08-31T13:46:05  <mcstar> it has pretty good c++11 support now
2012-08-31T13:46:06  <antimatroidl> oh wait, apple :P
2012-08-31T13:46:15  <mcstar> it isnt a shit one
2012-08-31T13:46:25  <mcstar> but not quite up to date
2012-08-31T13:46:35  <mcstar> ask debian, why is their software outdated
2012-08-31T13:46:47  <antimatroidl> i don't know, couldn't even get it booted :P
2012-08-31T13:46:53  <mcstar> they test it thorougly, and dont keep up with the crowd
2012-08-31T13:47:35  <mcstar> still, id argue that you dont need c++ for your work
2012-08-31T13:47:49  <mcstar> but i can accept for the moment that you dont have time to learn something else
2012-08-31T13:49:07  <mcstar> antimatroidl: gcc --version pls
2012-08-31T13:49:08  <antimatroidl> :P
2012-08-31T13:49:18  <mcstar> im wondering how old that is
2012-08-31T13:49:19  <antimatroidl> c++ all the things
2012-08-31T13:49:34  <antimatroidl> 4.2.1
2012-08-31T13:49:37  <mcstar> whats your os anyway?
2012-08-31T13:49:40  <mcstar> oh 4.2
2012-08-31T13:49:50  <mcstar> whoa
2012-08-31T13:49:53  <mcstar> i think thats old
2012-08-31T13:50:00  <antimatroidl> 10.6.8
2012-08-31T13:50:13  <mcstar> antimatroidl: did you install that from somewhere?
2012-08-31T13:50:23  <mcstar> i cant remember if osx ships with a compiler by default
2012-08-31T13:50:27  <antimatroidl> not sure if it came with or not
2012-08-31T13:50:27  <mcstar> or you need to install xcode
2012-08-31T13:50:40  <antimatroidl> if i installed xcode it would have been off a disc
2012-08-31T13:50:45  <mcstar> cause 10.6 cant ship with gcc 4.2 thats too old
2012-08-31T13:51:04  <mcstar> ok, i think someone installed an outdated xcode on that system
2012-08-31T13:51:51  <antimatroidl> computers are so much mehffort aha :P
2012-08-31T13:52:12  <antimatroidl> i no longer need it for what i'm currently doing anyway
2012-08-31T13:52:20  <antimatroidl> decided i actually wanted ordered sets
2012-08-31T13:54:01  <mcstar> aha
2012-08-31T13:54:03  <mcstar> great
2012-08-31T13:54:13  <mcstar> i think you have xcode 3.x
2012-08-31T14:03:39  <antimatroidl> full retro?
2012-08-31T14:05:29  <mcstar> 3.1 vs, the current 4.4
2012-08-31T14:06:35  <mcstar> antimatroidl: have you used macports before?
2012-08-31T14:06:40  <antimatroidl> nope
2012-08-31T14:07:23  <mcstar> it even has gcc 4.8, though the current one is 4.7
2012-08-31T14:07:31  <mcstar> you could easily install from there
2012-08-31T14:07:39  <mcstar> i used it a lot when i had a mac
2012-08-31T14:18:35  <antimatroidl> it's meant to get to 20 degrees on tuesday
2012-08-31T14:18:36  <antimatroidl> woo
