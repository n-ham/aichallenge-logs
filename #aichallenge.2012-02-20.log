2012-02-20T07:35:55  <delt0r_> yes...
2012-02-20T07:36:13  <delt0r_> and know no one i know has read it ... but there are more to ask
2012-02-20T07:36:37  <mcstar> k, thanks
2012-02-20T07:36:42  <delt0r_> i have not had a party in the med department for a while... that is where i meet both
2012-02-20T07:36:44  <delt0r_> most
2012-02-20T07:37:19  <mcstar> so they probabluy never heard of the author too
2012-02-20T07:37:30  <delt0r_> sorry... i suspect being a little outside the core remit... most just don't get time to read outside the papers we need to keep up with
2012-02-20T07:38:21  <mcstar> it isnt a nature article, thats for sure XD

2012-02-20T15:12:44  <mcstar> amstan: did you like dolphin's column view?
2012-02-20T15:13:35  <amstan> i use krusader
2012-02-20T15:14:18  <mcstar> the 2-pane manager
2012-02-20T15:14:43  <mcstar> well, i liked dolphin exactly because of the very comvenient column view
2012-02-20T15:14:50  <mcstar> and it is gone in dolphin 2.0 kde 4.8
2012-02-20T15:15:37  <mcstar> and somewhat disappointed in the dev team
2012-02-20T15:15:42  <mcstar> and->im
2012-02-20T15:15:57  <amstan> what do you mean column view?
2012-02-20T15:16:12  <mcstar> miller columns
2012-02-20T15:16:15  <mcstar> like finder
2012-02-20T15:17:33  <mcstar> they even made the columns resizeable in the ends
2012-02-20T15:17:36  <mcstar> -s
2012-02-20T15:17:44  <mcstar> and when its perfect, they remove it altogether
2012-02-20T15:18:09  <mcstar> lol, im seriously considering writing a file manager
2012-02-20T15:18:19  <amstan> nothing's stopping you
2012-02-20T15:18:24  <amstan> i suggest pyside/pyqt
2012-02-20T15:18:42  * amstan is reverse engineering a joystick serial protocol
2012-02-20T15:18:52  <mcstar> i was thinking about gnustep
2012-02-20T15:18:52  * amstan wants to write a driver for it
2012-02-20T15:19:08  <mcstar> since all this came originally from nextstep
2012-02-20T15:19:12  <mcstar> good luck
2012-02-20T15:19:21  <mcstar> why need reverse engineering?
2012-02-20T15:19:34  <amstan> because i don't have a driver for it
2012-02-20T15:19:41  <amstan> the only driver is on a cd for windows 98
2012-02-20T15:20:05  <mcstar> oh, some old proprietary sh@t?
2012-02-20T15:20:08  <amstan> yes
2012-02-20T15:20:28  <mcstar> wouldnt it be easier to buy an usb one?
2012-02-20T15:20:36  <mcstar> well, if you like the challenge..

2012-02-20T15:21:30  <mcstar> you can see the whole dir structure all at once
2012-02-20T15:21:59  <mcstar> with the horizontal scroll, you could scroll the columns left/right
2012-02-20T15:22:03  <amstan> oh, i know that one
2012-02-20T15:22:05  <amstan> sure
2012-02-20T15:22:09  <amstan> so what's wrong with it?
2012-02-20T15:22:20  <mcstar> they removed from dolphin!!!
2012-02-20T15:22:52  <amstan> oh, wow
2012-02-20T15:22:53  <amstan> lol
2012-02-20T15:23:07  <amstan> i never understood the art of removing features users liked
2012-02-20T15:23:32  <amstan> or the art of making 1 button apllications that don't do absolutely anything more than what their name entails
2012-02-20T15:23:44  <amstan> paint! now with just a paintbrush, no erase functionality!
2012-02-20T15:23:51  <amstan> not even a save option!
2012-02-20T15:24:05  <mcstar> what?
2012-02-20T15:24:07  <mcstar> are you making this up?
2012-02-20T15:24:10  <amstan> no
2012-02-20T15:24:16  <amstan> see any other gnome app out there
2012-02-20T15:24:25  <mcstar> oh, i dont like gnome
2012-02-20T15:24:27  <amstan> they try to get as few buttons as possible for some reason
2012-02-20T15:24:36  <amstan> even though users might want some of the features
2012-02-20T15:24:55  <mcstar> just when i said, nice, gnome could be a decent desktop with a dock and compiz, they changed it too
2012-02-20T15:25:14  <mcstar> i have it installed btw
2012-02-20T15:25:27  <mcstar> i just dont understand how could somebody use it productively
2012-02-20T15:25:42  <mcstar> its AWKWARD to switch between applications and desktops
2012-02-20T15:25:54  <mcstar> (with the mouse anyay)
2012-02-20T15:26:15  <mcstar> it seems im gonna remove all of gnome and kde
2012-02-20T15:26:34  <mcstar> i have 1 kde application that i really liked
2012-02-20T15:26:36  <mcstar> konsole
2012-02-20T15:26:44  <mcstar> i keeping that
2012-02-20T15:26:46  <mcstar> m
2012-02-20T15:27:21  <mcstar> arch packaged kde  pretty modularily, so i dont think im gonna need many dependencies
2012-02-20T15:29:00  <mcstar> im going to call my file manager Hider
2012-02-20T15:29:26  <mcstar> or

2012-02-20T15:41:11  <delt0r> I liked iceWM
2012-02-20T15:41:24  <delt0r> but i use kde these days... getting old
2012-02-20T15:41:47  <delt0r> so has something like poker been suggested for a possible game?
2012-02-20T15:42:47  <Fyi> Just poker is no fun
2012-02-20T15:43:51  <delt0r> well there are some unis that do as serious ai research
2012-02-20T15:43:52  <mcstar> Striptease Poker then
2012-02-20T15:44:04  <delt0r> and well with so many watching live games... its fun for some
2012-02-20T15:44:05  <Fyi> To be popular, at least visualizer must slightly resemble strp poker
2012-02-20T15:44:13  <delt0r> after all i thought ants was pretty boring
2012-02-20T15:44:18  <delt0r> at least to watch
2012-02-20T15:44:36  <mcstar> ants vis. was utilitarian, and it was FUN
2012-02-20T15:44:50  <delt0r> i did not find it fun
2012-02-20T15:44:53  <mcstar> you could only say it wasnt, if your ants didnt do anything interesting
2012-02-20T15:44:57  <delt0r> i found galcon much more fun
2012-02-20T15:45:15  <delt0r> you know people have different ideas of what is fun
2012-02-20T15:45:25  <delt0r> we don't all watch us football
2012-02-20T15:45:26  <mcstar> i dont know anyone
2012-02-20T15:45:27  <Fyi> Whatching was boring, agree. Only those bots with walls and frontlines were interesting to look at
2012-02-20T15:45:54  <mcstar> i was always using the mouse though, i have to admit
2012-02-20T15:45:59  <delt0r> Fyi: so do you have any suggestions? or at the kind of game?
2012-02-20T15:46:00  <mcstar> i.e. not in real time
2012-02-20T15:46:20  <delt0r> we know that mcstar wants something that he can hit with a theory hammer
2012-02-20T15:46:41  <mcstar> fyi quick, brainstorming!
2012-02-20T15:46:49  <Fyi> Harversters
2012-02-20T15:46:52  <delt0r> Fyi: sorry... last bit should say: what kind of game
2012-02-20T15:47:03  <Fyi> Just posted a message on it
2012-02-20T15:47:13  <mcstar> where?
2012-02-20T15:47:23  * mcstar cant access forums
2012-02-20T15:48:11  <Fyi> Ok, but i think name describes the idea: n harversters collect spice from m deposits and bring itmto l stations
2012-02-20T15:48:28  <mcstar> harverster or harverster?
2012-02-20T15:48:35  <mcstar> damn...
2012-02-20T15:49:01  <mcstar> this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvester_(video_game)
2012-02-20T15:49:02  <delt0r> thats kinda ants again
2012-02-20T15:49:21  <Fyi> Competitive salesman problem. Might be fun even without worms
2012-02-20T15:49:42  <mcstar> haha
2012-02-20T15:49:48  <Fyi> No kills at all
2012-02-20T15:49:54  <mcstar> some kind of parasite epidemic?
2012-02-20T15:50:03  <delt0r> well typically we try and have something a bit different... it feels very similar
2012-02-20T15:50:05  <mcstar> the salesmen are the agents
2012-02-20T15:50:14  <pairofdice> Just add zombies
2012-02-20T15:50:15  <mcstar> sorry, vectors
2012-02-20T15:50:59  <mcstar> gnome removed

2012-02-20T15:52:29  <Fyi> So, basically you want something which is not easily convergible to some popular game theory problems...
2012-02-20T15:53:46  <pairofdice> Otherwise the top hundred all have the same score
2012-02-20T15:54:09  <pairofdice> Are tied/whatever
2012-02-20T15:54:57  <Fyi> Planetwars was a good example. I still believe there is a lot of room for improvement
2012-02-20T15:57:01  <mcstar> lol
2012-02-20T15:57:17  <mcstar> i didnt know they made video games from Bill and Ted's excellent advetures
2012-02-20T15:57:45  <mcstar> it has time travek
2012-02-20T15:57:47  <mcstar> l
2012-02-20T15:57:49  <mcstar> l
2012-02-20T15:58:45  <mcstar> Each level takes place on a single screen. Players must collect scattered time fragments while jumping platforms, climbing ladders or ropes, and avoiding enemies.
2012-02-20T15:58:52  <mcstar> what could be more fun!

2012-02-20T16:00:44  <mcstar> we lost another one
2012-02-20T16:10:38  <mcstar> how about simultaneous chess? but... it would require energy to make your moves, with time passing, your energy reserve can build up, and the longer the move, or more quickly you make it, the more energy it would require?
2012-02-20T16:11:05  <mcstar> ofc, the board would be pretty big, and you could have different number of players than in real chess
2012-02-20T16:11:08  <pairofdice> meh
2012-02-20T16:11:29  <mcstar> time would be continuous
2012-02-20T16:11:40  <mcstar> how about that?
2012-02-20T16:12:06  <pairofdice> Very bad
2012-02-20T16:12:13  <mcstar> :(
2012-02-20T16:12:50  <pairofdice> And I would like it if you didn't speak of c**** again
2012-02-20T16:12:51  <mcstar> pairofdice: like your idea is so good: adding zombies XD
2012-02-20T16:12:57  <mcstar> chess?
2012-02-20T16:13:25  <pairofdice> zombies make everything better!
2012-02-20T16:13:40  <mcstar> pairofdice: are you a burned-out child chess prodigy?

2012-02-20T17:03:07  <delt0r_> what do folks here think of asteroids that has been suggested?
2012-02-20T17:04:19  <mcstar> delt0r_: i didnt like the plain asteroids, i suggested some modifications to aerique, he seemed to like it, thats all i know
2012-02-20T17:09:15  <delt0r_> mcstar: what where your suggestions?
2012-02-20T17:10:15  <mcstar> that asteroids could accumulate hits
2012-02-20T17:10:22  <mcstar> and each would have a limit
2012-02-20T17:10:33  <mcstar> whihc when is met, it would explode
2012-02-20T17:10:47  <mcstar> so basically it could take hits from different players at the same time
2012-02-20T17:10:50  <delt0r_> rather than just break up on first hit?
2012-02-20T17:10:56  <mcstar> yes, but wait
2012-02-20T17:11:08  <mcstar> and you could steer asteroids by firing at them
2012-02-20T17:11:17  <delt0r_> i c
2012-02-20T17:11:20  <mcstar> so you must break up the big ones, mayeb even cooperatively
2012-02-20T17:11:35  <mcstar> so that you can target with the little ones at other ships
2012-02-20T17:11:37  <delt0r_> was thinking that if they break up with well defined rules, you can do that with fragments
2012-02-20T17:12:19  <mcstar> there might have been some other thing too
2012-02-20T17:12:22  <mcstar> i dont remember
2012-02-20T17:12:42  <delt0r_> well the forums don't seem to have your suggestions
2012-02-20T17:13:05  <mcstar> they never will unless someone else takes interest in them
2012-02-20T17:13:21  <delt0r_> ?? there are a few posts you know
2012-02-20T17:13:39  <mcstar> delt0r_: i dont even know what forum you are talking about
2012-02-20T17:13:47  <delt0r_> aichallange
2012-02-20T17:13:49  <mcstar> (which topic)
2012-02-20T17:13:52  <mcstar> ofc aichallenge
2012-02-20T17:13:53  <delt0r_> suggestions
2012-02-20T17:13:57  <mcstar> but i dont read/browse them
2012-02-20T17:14:13  <delt0r_> its the best place to keep a record of suggestions
2012-02-20T17:14:36  <delt0r_> grepping logs blows
2012-02-20T17:14:37  <mcstar> i didnt think it was worth much
2012-02-20T17:15:21  <mcstar> delt0r_: now, the problem is that i dont know even how to read that forum
2012-02-20T17:15:25  <mcstar> i went to suggestions
2012-02-20T17:15:30  <mcstar> but its a mess
2012-02-20T17:15:43  <mcstar> 7 pages of titles
2012-02-20T17:15:56  <mcstar> it is comparable to the Library of Congress
2012-02-20T17:17:16  <mcstar> add "source code available" to the leaderboat?
2012-02-20T17:17:20  <mcstar> XD
2012-02-20T17:18:26  <delt0r_> look at the dates... its fine... and there is not that much since the end of ants
2012-02-20T17:18:54  <mcstar> ah
2012-02-20T17:19:10  <mcstar> ok, i thought it was all accumulated since ants is over
2012-02-20T17:20:06  <delt0r_> na... only about 10-20 suggestions.. most of which don't have replys...
2012-02-20T17:20:32  <delt0r_> what happens is one thread gets all the attention and that sort becomes the "favourite" suggestion
2012-02-20T17:20:41  <delt0r_> well that how ants happened
2012-02-20T17:22:14  <mcstar> so asteroids have the most replies
2012-02-20T17:22:44  <mcstar> "Asteroids also presents a unique opportunity to build a visualizer that will blow spectators out of the water - with collisions, explosions, trails and even sound. "
2012-02-20T17:22:55  <mcstar> welllll
2012-02-20T17:23:03  <mcstar> i dont want that
2012-02-20T17:23:52  <mcstar> what could be interesting, is to watch the games, from any one bot's perspective
2012-02-20T17:23:57  <mcstar> like the debug visualizer

2012-02-20T17:24:58  <mcstar> to see the inner workings of the bots..
2012-02-20T17:25:29  <mcstar> that beats all kind of 'special effects'
2012-02-20T17:25:37  <delt0r_> what ever floats your boat
2012-02-20T17:25:51  <delt0r_> one does not imply that we can't do the other
2012-02-20T17:26:40  <delt0r_> fact of the matter is that without someone on this "as a job" it is unlikely that there will be that much in the way of special effects
2012-02-20T17:26:48  <delt0r_> it takes serious time to do
2012-02-20T17:27:09  <mcstar> im happy with wireframe graphics
2012-02-20T17:27:13  <mcstar> and no effects
2012-02-20T17:27:42  <mcstar> somehow it should be made mandatory for the bots to output strategu decisions
2012-02-20T17:28:03  <mcstar> continuing my above argument...
2012-02-20T17:28:22  <delt0r_> that is not likely...
2012-02-20T17:28:28  <mcstar> this would have made Ants more interesting to watch
2012-02-20T17:28:33  <mcstar> you have to agree with this
2012-02-20T17:28:49  <delt0r_> since many would percive this as cheating... or some other such nonsense
2012-02-20T17:28:58  <mcstar> how so?
2012-02-20T17:29:02  <mcstar> i dont see that
2012-02-20T17:29:24  <delt0r_> during planet wars someone released source of a top 100 bot
2012-02-20T17:29:29  <delt0r_> shesh...
2012-02-20T17:29:33  <delt0r_> what a flameware
2012-02-20T17:29:36  <delt0r_> flame war
2012-02-20T17:30:01  <delt0r_> OMG why did i even bother writing any code at all... you have ruined for everone
2012-02-20T17:30:07  <delt0r_> that sort of thing...
2012-02-20T17:30:25  <mcstar> i explicitely said 'in the finals'
2012-02-20T17:30:35  <delt0r_> since showing others "how its working" is similar i can see a lot of people getting all funny about it
2012-02-20T17:30:37  <mcstar> after submissions are closed
2012-02-20T17:30:53  <mcstar> i wouldnt want to show my strategu before that
2012-02-20T17:31:09  <delt0r_> hmmm... well that is a pita to debug... if its not in the rounds... why bother with the finals... you can get the source of a lot anyways
2012-02-20T17:31:30  <delt0r_> then look at what they do
2012-02-20T17:31:32  <mcstar> we disagree on this one then
2012-02-20T17:31:36  <mcstar> nvm
2012-02-20T17:31:37  <delt0r_> lol
2012-02-20T17:32:01  <delt0r_> not from an idea perspective... from an implementation one...
2012-02-20T17:32:29  <delt0r_> we are struggling to get the framework rewritten already... we are short on labour
2012-02-20T17:33:40  <mcstar> you should donate some of you phd students' time for the contest
2012-02-20T17:33:46  <mcstar> r
2012-02-20T17:34:13  <delt0r_> that is what we need... some more direct university involvement.
