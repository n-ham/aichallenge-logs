2011-09-17T01:57:03  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I need a way to prevent trueskill from favoring players
2011-09-17T02:00:55  <mleise> what do you mean by 'favoring' ? Oo
2011-09-17T02:01:46  <McLeopold> well, if you have a seed player that can play two other players, trueskill match quality will favor the player with the lower sigma
2011-09-17T02:01:57  <McLeopold> if there mu's are the same
2011-09-17T02:02:10  <McLeopold> after they play, they get updated and the sigmas drop more
2011-09-17T02:02:39  <McLeopold> so a player that gets a few games in will have low sigma and suddenly be picked more for matches than others
2011-09-17T02:02:56  <McLeopold> just look at the current rankings to see the issue
2011-09-17T02:11:10  <mleise> I've seen the effect, but I had no idea it was because of equal mu's
2011-09-17T02:14:12  <delt0r_> Morning
2011-09-17T02:15:49  <delt0r_> McLeopold: I am a math guy and i read the TrueSkill paper... but i know of no easy way to fix such things. Basically its the model
2011-09-17T02:15:53  <delt0r_> more or less
2011-09-17T02:16:39  <delt0r_> Personally i think there is a need for a better model --or at least better inference of "true" parameters from games played
2011-09-17T02:17:09  <delt0r_> I have pondered this and came up with only a ML idea... that could work --perhaps
2011-09-17T02:22:50  <McLeopold> delt0r_: I figure we need to make sure each user has about the same number of games in a 24 hour period, so there needs to be some sort of skew to the match quality to pick opponents that may not be the better match
2011-09-17T02:23:21  <delt0r_> it is a hard problem
2011-09-17T02:23:31  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-17T02:23:36  <delt0r_> esp when we consider new submissions
2011-09-17T02:23:43  <McLeopold> yep
2011-09-17T02:23:48  <McLeopold> thus the 24 hour period
2011-09-17T02:24:07  <McLeopold> new submissions would get some preference at the start
2011-09-17T02:24:10  <delt0r_> i would probably try to have something that works IIF there are no new submissions
2011-09-17T02:25:11  <delt0r_> Of course the even harder problem is getting it so others don't complain :D
2011-09-17T02:25:32  <McLeopold> I usually don't care about that, but right now it isn't good
2011-09-17T02:25:52  <delt0r_> But if we have the compute power for a lot of games --it should not be to hard right?
2011-09-17T02:26:02  * delt0r_ looks at how it works now
2011-09-17T02:26:40  <McLeopold> the more games at once, the smaller the problem becomes
2011-09-17T02:26:56  <McLeopold> because I restrict matches to those not in a game
2011-09-17T02:27:08  <delt0r_> good idea
2011-09-17T02:27:30  <McLeopold> so if everyone is playing at once, then roughly everyone gets one game at the same rate
2011-09-17T02:27:37  <delt0r_> also what works best for true skill? 2 player, or n player games
2011-09-17T02:27:42  <McLeopold> but then player rotation would be poor
2011-09-17T02:27:58  <McLeopold> it depends
2011-09-17T02:28:44  <McLeopold> generally more players without ties cause bigger updates
2011-09-17T02:29:00  <delt0r_> mmm
2011-09-17T02:29:17  <delt0r_> what is the word on going live?
2011-09-17T02:29:28  <McLeopold> next week
2011-09-17T02:29:39  <McLeopold> but I got to fix this first
2011-09-17T02:30:05  <delt0r_> right --is the php trueskill thing working
2011-09-17T02:30:22  <McLeopold> so, if you have a choice of playing 2 players with match qualities 50% and 51%, right now I always pick 51%
2011-09-17T02:30:42  <McLeopold> delt0r_: yes, if draw prob is 1.75 or higher it makes a world of difference
2011-09-17T02:30:58  <McLeopold> 10 players with only 3 ranks is the worst
2011-09-17T02:31:11  <delt0r_> oh good. that would work with the jskills one too
2011-09-17T02:31:19  <McLeopold> yeah, same issue
2011-09-17T02:31:21  <delt0r_> should be higher than 1% anyway IMO
2011-09-17T02:31:31  <McLeopold> convergence is much faster with a higher draw prob
2011-09-17T02:31:44  <delt0r_> i think it will match the data better too
2011-09-17T02:32:02  <McLeopold> well, because the scores are based on minute differences, I figured it would be close to zero
2011-09-17T02:32:54  <McLeopold> the higher the draw prob, the bigger the update for a win, and I was thinking the game is to noisy for that
2011-09-17T02:33:53  <delt0r_> I think it would be noise regardless... since it only considers rank--and esp at the start when most player scores are random anyway
2011-09-17T02:34:08  <delt0r_> noisy
2011-09-17T02:34:25  <McLeopold> yea, so back to my example, pick the player with 50% or 51%?
2011-09-17T02:34:30  <delt0r_> do we keep track of who played who?
2011-09-17T02:34:40  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-17T02:34:45  <McLeopold> there is some no repeat logic
2011-09-17T02:34:51  <delt0r_> cool
2011-09-17T02:35:15  <delt0r_> well i am i guy who does a lot of stochastic simulations
2011-09-17T02:35:29  <McLeopold> yeah, so you can help me with this matchmaking then :)
2011-09-17T02:35:34  <delt0r_> so i would pick the 50% with some p or 51% otherwise
2011-09-17T02:35:41  <McLeopold> right
2011-09-17T02:35:50  <McLeopold> if the average bot has 24 games a day
2011-09-17T02:36:09  <McLeopold> and the 50% guy has only had 20, and the 51% guy has had 22?
2011-09-17T02:36:15  <delt0r_> the idea is that in the limit all possible games get played... ie after 1 million or so years
2011-09-17T02:36:23  <delt0r_> ah
2011-09-17T02:36:30  <delt0r_> k let me work it out
2011-09-17T02:36:46  <delt0r_> its exponetail
2011-09-17T02:36:53  <delt0r_> dam my bad english
2011-09-17T02:37:02  <McLeopold> what is your language? austrian?
2011-09-17T02:37:31  <delt0r_> no --english
2011-09-17T02:37:34  <delt0r_> :D
2011-09-17T02:37:54  <delt0r_> can order beer in german and food --that is about it
2011-09-17T02:38:04  <McLeopold> oh, I was guessing from the .as uri :)
2011-09-17T02:38:39  <McLeopold> once we get going, most bots will have 20-30 other bots with a match quality > 90%
2011-09-17T02:39:19  <McLeopold> the top 20 all have low sigma, the higher sigma bots dont appear until around 20-30 down on the list
2011-09-17T02:39:25  <McLeopold> even though the mu is closer
2011-09-17T02:39:55  <McLeopold> so I need to skew the match quality to be higher for bots that haven't had many games
2011-09-17T02:39:56  <delt0r_> So if we have n games per day with m players --that gives nm slots per day
2011-09-17T02:40:13  <McLeopold> it would be natural to increase sigma, since that represents uncertainty
2011-09-17T02:40:38  <delt0r_> oh... you want it not to be memory less... curse my math

2011-09-17T02:41:37  <delt0r_> McLeopold: doesn't the trueskill think estimate the sigma?
2011-09-17T02:42:03  <McLeopold> no, mu and sigma are stored in the db for every submission
2011-09-17T02:42:09  <delt0r_> s/think/thing

2011-09-17T02:42:32  <McLeopold> http://pastebin.com/N68fAUbM
2011-09-17T02:42:36  * delt0r_ reads the paper again 
2011-09-17T02:43:35  <McLeopold> you may need to increase the width to read that table correctly
2011-09-17T02:44:53  <McLeopold> delt0r_:  or view it raw
2011-09-17T02:45:01  <delt0r_> yea... big ascii table person myself... xl is for ms slaves ;)
2011-09-17T02:45:16  <McLeopold> google docs?
2011-09-17T02:45:32  <delt0r_> but the mu and sigma scores are the current ranks etc correct?
2011-09-17T02:45:38  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-17T02:45:43  <delt0r_> yep--i now use google docs a lot
2011-09-17T02:46:04  <McLeopold> so on that table, see how the low game_count submissions are down the list?
2011-09-17T02:46:30  <McLeopold> there is a mu_diff of 0.16, which is the closest mu way down there
2011-09-17T02:47:52  <delt0r_> i c
2011-09-17T02:47:53  <McLeopold> I'm thinking scale the sigma by the number of games in the last 24 hours somehow
2011-09-17T02:48:28  <delt0r_> I really don't follow... should not the trueskills thing take that into account properly...
2011-09-17T02:48:47  <McLeopold> this is a table of match quality
2011-09-17T02:49:12  <McLeopold> if everyone is always available to play, it will set you up with the same people over and over
2011-09-17T02:49:32  <delt0r_> yea... even on the icc that is a problem
2011-09-17T02:49:42  <McLeopold> icc?
2011-09-17T02:49:51  <delt0r_> internet chess club
2011-09-17T02:49:53  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-17T02:50:03  <delt0r_> aka where elo got famous
2011-09-17T02:50:21  <McLeopold> but they use glicko now?
2011-09-17T02:50:54  <delt0r_> which is still similar --and you still have the match like in "skill" keep matching the same people
2011-09-17T02:51:07  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-17T02:51:31  <McLeopold> I don't care so much about playing the same people, it's just ignoring some people too much
2011-09-17T02:51:32  <delt0r_> last i heard it was still a problem if you wanted variety
2011-09-17T02:51:54  <delt0r_> what about like last year with the que system?
2011-09-17T02:52:23  <delt0r_> oh.. then you get very unlike in skill
2011-09-17T02:52:25  <McLeopold> well, I wanted each match to calc live
2011-09-17T02:52:40  <delt0r_> so you still need to sometimes pick folks that have had many games
2011-09-17T02:52:45  <McLeopold> so new submissions find their rank really fast
2011-09-17T02:53:04  <delt0r_> I just don't think that is generally possible
2011-09-17T02:53:15  <McLeopold> yeah, so your idea about probabilites might work somehow
2011-09-17T02:53:39  <delt0r_> a hack could just be a weighting
2011-09-17T02:54:01  <delt0r_> the 51% is always picked if games played are the same
2011-09-17T02:54:02  <McLeopold> 1 / recent games
2011-09-17T02:54:12  <delt0r_> mm yea
2011-09-17T02:54:42  <McLeopold> the think is, I'm doing a sql statement with an order by and a limit 1
2011-09-17T02:55:24  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-17T02:55:47  <McLeopold> I could limit the field to the top 10% in match quality, then choose from those the ones with the least games?
2011-09-17T02:55:50  <delt0r_> not sure tbh --i would probably just use some selected to get a range of possibles then use some biased random selection
2011-09-17T02:56:07  <delt0r_> yea something like that...
2011-09-17T02:56:10  <McLeopold> we just said the same thing :D
2011-09-17T02:57:15  <McLeopold> getting a percentage is a pita in sql :(
2011-09-17T02:57:43  <delt0r_> I would selected a range... and deal with different sized lists
2011-09-17T02:58:26  <McLeopold> I don't follow you
2011-09-17T02:58:42  <delt0r_> what would be best is something from trueskill that would tell use what games would have the most "information"
2011-09-17T02:58:58  <McLeopold> that is match quality, they are the same thing
2011-09-17T02:59:05  <McLeopold> so we have that
2011-09-17T02:59:06  <delt0r_> selected players with mu> and mu<
2011-09-17T02:59:16  <delt0r_> in advanced?
2011-09-17T02:59:20  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-17T02:59:34  <McLeopold> well, each match created calculates it all right there
2011-09-17T02:59:38  <delt0r_> I really should read the paper again... it seems i missed some details
2011-09-17T03:00:02  <McLeopold> the higher the match quality, the larger the updates will be, and the faster convergence to the correct mu is
2011-09-17T03:00:04  <delt0r_> before you play it? perhaps that may be a good way to choose... if it is a fast calc
2011-09-17T03:00:36  <McLeopold> it is, it's just we can use quality alone, because once you get a low sigma, you just start snowballing into more games
2011-09-17T03:00:56  <McLeopold> I think the top x% is the way to go
2011-09-17T03:01:05  <delt0r_> just printed the wrong true skill paper
2011-09-17T03:01:12  <McLeopold> print!?

2011-09-17T03:07:22  <McLeopold> I have to use an approximation of the 2 player simplified version

2011-09-17T03:12:51  <antimatroid> my bots profile seems to have games finish within 300 turns
2011-09-17T03:13:08  <McLeopold> I lowered the max to 255, so I could get a lot of games in

2011-09-17T03:13:27  <antimatroid> planet wars was 1 second per turn with max 200, so n players will reduce the number of games but you get more players in each game
2011-09-17T03:13:28  <delt0r_> How about choose a large number of possible games, then rank them according to "quality" and game count..
2011-09-17T03:13:43  <antimatroid> also, the beta server isn't very good yeah? we don't have ec2 servers up and running yet?
2011-09-17T03:13:48  <delt0r_> then pop the first game off the sorted list, rinse and repeat
2011-09-17T03:14:19  <McLeopold> delt0r_: that's kinda what I do, but I add 1 player at a time until I reach the player count
2011-09-17T03:14:25  <antimatroid> oh, you mean the variation in game counts is awful?
2011-09-17T03:14:34  <delt0r_> what is the performance of ec2 like... we have gone off virtilized stuff--it is about 2-3 slower than without it
2011-09-17T03:14:50  <McLeopold> delt0r_: it's the "rank by .. and count" that I need help with
2011-09-17T03:15:13  <McLeopold> you'' have to ask janzert about that
2011-09-17T03:15:25  <delt0r_> McLeopold: yea, but i am talking about games here not players... so you can have 10000 possible games that you then sort
2011-09-17T03:15:33  <antimatroid> i think what janzert had for selecting players last time was good, just pick the first player in the game as the bot with the least number of games played
2011-09-17T03:15:45  <antimatroid> although that might be an issue with people reuploading? hmmmm
2011-09-17T03:16:10  <antimatroid> bot with the lowest average number of games per hour/day?
2011-09-17T03:16:10  <McLeopold> delt0r_: I just need some outer joins to get that
2011-09-17T03:16:17  <antimatroid> since it was submitted
2011-09-17T03:16:20  <delt0r_> antimatroid: that does not work quite as well at it looks when one considers that you want to play liked skill folks that may all have played a lot
2011-09-17T03:16:31  <delt0r_> Oh.. db..
2011-09-17T03:16:45  <antimatroid> yes, you select the first player in the game, then select the rest of the players weighted towards that players ranking somehow?
2011-09-17T03:16:59  <McLeopold> yes, the seed player is the last to have played, that is working, it's the opponent matching that is off

2011-09-17T03:17:24  <delt0r_> Well for one project we just loaded the whole table into ram, did what we wanted .. then sent it all back.. wrapped in a transaction.
2011-09-17T03:17:49  <McLeopold> I've got match quality in an sql statment right now
2011-09-17T03:17:55  <delt0r_> we have a 2 day transaction!
2011-09-17T03:18:09  <delt0r_> had
2011-09-17T03:18:54  <McLeopold> even with tons of possible games, I'm still going to get a cluster of opponents with low sigma, and many games
2011-09-17T03:19:15  <delt0r_> well if you generate a lot of possible games, then first sort on what will bring the player count to more even...
2011-09-17T03:19:39  <McLeopold> I've got to balance that with the quality though.
2011-09-17T03:19:40  <delt0r_> well will say 1000000
2011-09-17T03:19:43  <delt0r_> with
2011-09-17T03:20:00  <delt0r_> the orginal games are still picked with that criteria
2011-09-17T03:20:13  <McLeopold> I *know* how to select the player with the least games.  I *know* how to select the best match quality.  I just need to combine the 2 intellegently.
2011-09-17T03:20:28  <delt0r_> the idea is that there is some games that are good  and help with games played, its just finding them that are hard
2011-09-17T03:20:45  <delt0r_> its possible that such a game does not exist of course
2011-09-17T03:21:06  <McLeopold> yes, I follow, but how do we decide which is more important?
2011-09-17T03:21:24  <delt0r_> complaints weighting ?
2011-09-17T03:21:33  <McLeopold> right, what's the weighting?
2011-09-17T03:22:22  <McLeopold> I've got 2 math guys here.  Can I get a formula?
2011-09-17T03:23:02  <delt0r_> It was a joke... but not really... there is no closed form thing here that would work off the top of my head
2011-09-17T03:23:12  <delt0r_> ad hoc all the way
2011-09-17T03:24:10  <McLeopold> :'(
2011-09-17T03:24:42  <delt0r_> Note i didn't want to pick the player with the least games... just generate a set based on normal criteria.. then sort on fixing played games.. if the set is large enough --i think that should converge
2011-09-17T03:24:54  <McLeopold> okay, I'm going to go with a percenticle of the best match quality combos and choose the one with the least played games
2011-09-17T03:25:02  <delt0r_> normal criteria means ignoring played games/
2011-09-17T03:25:26  <delt0r_> its as good as i can come up with right now...
2011-09-17T03:25:41  <McLeopold> so, how about the spreadsheet?
2011-09-17T03:25:51  <delt0r_> ?
2011-09-17T03:26:03  <McLeopold> for calculating match quality for more than 2 players
2011-09-17T03:26:20  <delt0r_> oh --that is what you mean by table A
2011-09-17T03:26:30  <McLeopold> A matrix
2011-09-17T03:26:32  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-17T03:26:38  <McLeopold> page 34, fluffy paper
2011-09-17T03:26:52  <McLeopold> titled "The 'A' Matrix"
2011-09-17T03:26:54  <delt0r_> I though the trueskill implementations would do it for you? no
2011-09-17T03:27:04  <McLeopold> uh..
2011-09-17T03:27:28  <delt0r_> speedsheet ? calculating match q
2011-09-17T03:27:39  <delt0r_> not following ..
2011-09-17T03:27:53  * delt0r_ is trying to read the paper at the same time 
2011-09-17T03:27:54  <McLeopold> so I can look at the formulas and play with them
2011-09-17T03:28:16  <McLeopold> http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/twoteamtrueskill.xls
2011-09-17T03:28:27  <McLeopold> they just didn't include the match quality
2011-09-17T03:29:04  <delt0r_> we have only one player per team, so  this makes it a bit easier
2011-09-17T03:29:22  <McLeopold> yes, without partial play
2011-09-17T03:29:43  <McLeopold> the implementation does give me the quality
2011-09-17T03:30:53  <McLeopold> but I'm doing it in sql
2011-09-17T03:31:57  <delt0r_> oh fun... sql for the win (not!)

2011-09-17T03:41:48  <McLeopold> delt0r_: do you think you could generate a 10 player game in 4 seconds with the 10000 combos method?
2011-09-17T03:42:22  <delt0r_> yea.. but with 10 players i don't 10000 is enough
2011-09-17T03:43:10  <delt0r_> i don't think
2011-09-17T03:43:34  <McLeopold> ~2.5 for the root
2011-09-17T03:43:37  <delt0r_> i would expect python to handle that fine too? no?
2011-09-17T03:44:00  <McLeopold> it's getting the data from the database to the app that I think would be slow

2011-09-17T03:44:20  <delt0r_> I know why i didn't know about game q scores... the orginal paper does not have them... its a later refinement
2011-09-17T03:44:33  <McLeopold> game q?
2011-09-17T03:44:35  <delt0r_> McLeopold: oh
2011-09-17T03:44:39  <delt0r_> game quality
2011-09-17T03:44:50  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-17T03:46:07  <delt0r_> it uses belief propagation --but is more approximate than i thought...
2011-09-17T03:46:26  <delt0r_> true draws would need a *lot* of iterations
2011-09-17T03:47:40  <delt0r_> And xbox thing is biased towards ensuring the top 3 sigma players are ranked well and not to give much of a crap about the rest :/
2011-09-17T03:48:27  <McLeopold> hm
2011-09-17T03:48:57  <delt0r_> again orginal paper
2011-09-17T03:49:15  <delt0r_> also for live games players choose opponents.
2011-09-17T03:49:32  <McLeopold> in some games
2011-09-17T03:49:56  <delt0r_> Oh yea... some leaderboards you don't get too... thats right
2011-09-17T03:50:01  <delt0r_> been a while
2011-09-17T03:51:10  <delt0r_> match quality is a measure of draw probability
2011-09-17T03:52:17  <delt0r_> also note that if i have a 3 player game with A>B>C
2011-09-17T03:52:56  <delt0r_> the possibility of A kicking C arse before even competing with B is not taken into account
2011-09-17T03:53:49  <McLeopold> you mean b kick c before a?
2011-09-17T03:55:11  <delt0r_> either or
2011-09-17T03:55:22  <delt0r_> winning is harder in the cases even for A
2011-09-17T03:55:31  <delt0r_> yet this is not really taken into account
2011-09-17T03:55:50  <delt0r_> perhaps extensions do...
2011-09-17T03:55:57  * delt0r_ looks up more papers
2011-09-17T03:56:03  <McLeopold> I've got a percentile sql solution, I'm going to try it out
2011-09-17T03:56:34  <McLeopold> no, trueskill and match quality only take initial skills and a ranking

2011-09-17T04:00:26  <delt0r_> do you keep all game result data? (i think so but it never hurts to ask)
2011-09-17T04:00:32  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-17T04:04:10  <delt0r_> so for shits and giggles I could for example come up with *awesomeness* score and see how that would rank everyone. ;)
2011-09-17T04:04:29  <McLeopold> we need that for the splash game :)
2011-09-17T04:04:35  <McLeopold> the game on the front page
2011-09-17T04:07:21  <delt0r_> thinking of rank statistics only... ie there is no score but only rank
2011-09-17T04:07:45  <McLeopold> we could store a separate mu and sigma for that in the database
2011-09-17T04:08:06  <McLeopold> you mean survival order?
2011-09-17T04:10:32  <delt0r_> well what is the ranking that give A>B>C with the minimum numbers of C>A sort of thing
2011-09-17T04:11:16  <delt0r_> my thinking is that we only get ranks out of games...
2011-09-17T04:11:37  <mleise> this is rocket science to mee
2011-09-17T04:11:50  <delt0r_> even if A beats everyone. It is not really data on how much A beats everyone by
2011-09-17T04:12:22  <McLeopold> that would be a whole new algorithm
2011-09-17T04:12:45  <McLeopold> with true skill, you just pair them with better people for the next game and see if they continue to climb
2011-09-17T04:13:15  <McLeopold> so their sigma stays fairly large until the lose
2011-09-17T04:13:18  <delt0r_> you still have a total rank, ie there are better people and much better people

2011-09-17T06:49:13  <delt0r_> I have come to the conclusion that true skill is a very good compromise on modeling and tractability. Dont think it can be done much better personall

2011-09-17T06:49:23  <delt0r_> whatever

2011-09-17T08:19:35  <mcstar> i mean you dont have to be compatible with anything than
2011-09-17T08:20:00  <mcstar> a protocol that an fps uses is very different from what you need
2011-09-17T08:20:20  <foRei> I've looked at WCF but im not sure
2011-09-17T08:21:24  <mcstar> why not stay posix?
2011-09-17T08:22:26  <foRei> Im not that much into stuff, I dont know posix
2011-09-17T08:23:15  <mcstar> posix=simple+portable
2011-09-17T08:23:30  <mcstar> do you really want to stick with windows?
2011-09-17T08:23:34  <mcstar> not that i really care
2011-09-17T08:24:00  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-17T08:24:26  <foRei> Im just trying to make a multiplayer game, not too concerned about what I use for now. Eventually I'll try them all one by and to learn advance/disadvantage. Is WCF a bad starting point?
2011-09-17T08:25:21  <mcstar> i only that that it has windows in its name so yes, a bad starting point
2011-09-17T08:25:30  <foRei> hehe
2011-09-17T08:25:38  <mcstar> thats something on top of .net right?
2011-09-17T08:25:51  <foRei> Yeah, Im programming in C# .net
2011-09-17T08:26:33  <mcstar> i would begin with something on a lower level
2011-09-17T08:26:50  <delt0r_> mutiplayer tic tac toe
2011-09-17T08:26:53  <mcstar> and you really shouldnt consider "fps" protocols for your game
2011-09-17T08:27:20  <mcstar> just imagine that you packets are structs, and you may use udp to send them as delt0r_ mentioned
2011-09-17T08:27:24  <delt0r_> use plain TCP with nice easy to parse text --then tools like tcpdump can work well
2011-09-17T08:27:41  <delt0r_> udp is not a good first choice
2011-09-17T08:27:45  <mcstar> delt0r_: no, why text?
2011-09-17T08:27:50  <mcstar> thats messy
2011-09-17T08:28:01  <delt0r_> tools like tcpdump etc can work really well with em
2011-09-17T08:28:16  <delt0r_> trust me there really is a good reason to keep it human readable
2011-09-17T08:28:18  <mcstar> you can have packets filters that convert back your binary
2011-09-17T08:28:26  <delt0r_> you have a bug
2011-09-17T08:28:40  <delt0r_> where is it... your game, your packets or conversion code
2011-09-17T08:28:46  <mcstar> but now you have to parse it
2011-09-17T08:29:06  <delt0r_> its just one more thing that can go wrong and misslead you when bug hunting
2011-09-17T08:29:16  <mcstar> but ok, it might be better to be able to see it
2011-09-17T08:29:22  <delt0r_> you can just read with you eyes...
2011-09-17T08:29:29  <delt0r_> human parsable/readable
2011-09-17T08:29:29  <mcstar> and dont call me Miss.
2011-09-17T08:29:36  <delt0r_> lol
2011-09-17T08:29:44  <delt0r_> well that is my 2c
2011-09-17T08:29:51  <delt0r_> from experiance...
2011-09-17T08:30:09  <delt0r_> its all easy peasy till its on real life networks
2011-09-17T08:30:15  <delt0r_> then it hits the fan
2011-09-17T08:33:15  <mcstar> my first read of that sentence had the opposite effect on me of what you meant

2011-09-17T09:12:29  <delt0r_> So when say 2 of my ant move to the same square they are removed without points correct?
2011-09-17T09:12:50  <delt0r_> yet if they get killed, the killers get points?
2011-09-17T09:13:21  <delt0r_> so if i see that my ants can't win a given fight, then suicide is in fact a good thing to do?
2011-09-17T09:15:16  <mcstar> it was discussed several times
2011-09-17T09:15:26  <mcstar> oyu can minimize the gain of the enemy yes
2011-09-17T09:16:20  <delt0r_> just checking... does not seem like a winning strat to me... but non the less :interesting
2011-09-17T09:16:29  <mcstar> i had a suicidal bot some time ago, did pretty well for that

2011-09-17T09:24:18  <mcstar> and now comes the laughing face
2011-09-17T09:24:20  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-17T09:24:30  <mcstar> stocha: hi, we missed you
2011-09-17T09:24:35  <stocha> mcstar: i didn't finalize my combat solving code. And i'm not very inclined to work on it
2011-09-17T09:25:01  <stocha> i still have read the logs. Once per month. not all. Very few of them. Just to see if the thing would launch :p
2011-09-17T09:25:13  <stocha> apparently it's about to go live.
2011-09-17T09:25:19  <mcstar> very much so
2011-09-17T09:25:20  <stocha> maybe.
2011-09-17T09:25:38  <stocha> i still think it should be made a 1vs1.
2011-09-17T09:26:00  <mcstar> so even before the contest started you sort of "finished" your work on it?
2011-09-17T09:26:05  <stocha> then maybe i would try to code something. But as it is, i just can't understand anything of what is going on. I find very few fun in that.
2011-09-17T09:26:18  <mcstar> little
2011-09-17T09:26:29  <mcstar> fun is uncountable
2011-09-17T09:27:02  <mcstar> the main point of the game is to write a good fighting alg.
2011-09-17T09:27:04  <stocha> mcstar: we had a huge amount of time to build a final bot during the beta. The main unknown being the environnement. Maps, food etc. Which may still be unknown until the end really.
2011-09-17T09:27:20  <mcstar> stocha: no, they will remain unknown
2011-09-17T09:27:51  <mcstar> ah, you meant end of beta or contest?
2011-09-17T09:27:53  <mcstar> nvm
2011-09-17T09:28:02  <stocha> end of contest.
2011-09-17T09:28:08  <mcstar> yeah, than right
2011-09-17T09:28:37  <mcstar> i think this was the easy part, now comes the hard one
2011-09-17T09:28:41  <stocha> did the top bot maker provide feed back about how fun it is to build a bot ?
2011-09-17T09:28:51  <mcstar> the bots dont really have any ai in them, unless they can fight well
2011-09-17T09:29:00  <stocha> did they really make a lot of progress ?
2011-09-17T09:29:12  <mcstar> well, you can see it for yourself
2011-09-17T09:29:18  <mcstar> revolt has some nice tactics
2011-09-17T09:29:21  <stocha> my bot had a lot of ai in them. But no fighting code yet.
2011-09-17T09:29:29  <mcstar> he contracts the regions
2011-09-17T09:29:36  <stocha> currently the ranking is down. (to few games per bot)
2011-09-17T09:29:59  <mcstar> yes, its volatile these days, they were reset yesterday even
2011-09-17T09:30:22  <mcstar> stocha: you know i had a snake bot too
2011-09-17T09:30:25  <mcstar> have you seen it?

2011-09-17T09:30:38  <mcstar> now that was almost AI, but otherwise it sucked
2011-09-17T09:31:03  <stocha> snake bot have poor chance of being top bots :)
2011-09-17T09:31:10  <mcstar> not really
2011-09-17T09:31:16  <mcstar> you have to make a smart snake bot
2011-09-17T09:31:20  <mcstar> many little snakes
2011-09-17T09:31:23  <stocha> also i'm color blind. So i just have no chance of understanding a multiplayer game. Unless it is very structured :)
2011-09-17T09:31:33  <mcstar> i forgot that
2011-09-17T09:31:46  <mcstar> lol, i cant imagine whats that like
2011-09-17T09:32:16  <mcstar> stocha: the visualizer can put little letters on the ants
2011-09-17T09:32:39  <stocha> yeah but the letter are even less readable.
2011-09-17T09:32:51  <stocha> basically, it's like every bot share the same color.
2011-09-17T09:32:55  <mcstar> project it to a wall
2011-09-17T09:33:15  <stocha> or half of them one color, and the other half another one. All in all, it's hard to read.
2011-09-17T09:33:37  <mcstar> do these colors stay the same?
2011-09-17T09:33:46  <mcstar> or depends on the environmet you see them in
2011-09-17T09:33:53  <stocha> even when zooming, i had more trouble interpreting the letters.
2011-09-17T09:34:21  <stocha> it's more a problem of : i c'ant track which ant belongs to the same team.
2011-09-17T09:34:46  <stocha> 1vs1 would be less of a problem.
2011-09-17T09:35:03  <stocha> easier to find easy to see colors.
2011-09-17T09:35:10  <stocha> and less messy overall most probably.
2011-09-17T09:35:47  <stocha> mm, i guess i'll be going.
2011-09-17T09:35:49  <stocha> see you :)
2011-09-17T09:36:08  <stocha> maybe i'll read what's going on up until launch. If it is next week.

2011-09-17T09:40:23  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i had suggested a long time ago that at any given time we just have a subset of players that are available for play. each time a player plays a game, he is removed from the candidate list and replaced with whatever player hasn't played a game for the longest time. the matching algorithm may only pick players from the candidate list

2011-09-17T15:28:11  <mcstar> on the contrary, i think this will be the interesting part
2011-09-17T15:28:45  <mcstar> i think that something similar will happen like in the previous contest
2011-09-17T15:28:56  <mcstar> the battle strategy will be a bit clearer
2011-09-17T15:29:10  <mcstar> and the implementation, and the ability to predict will win
2011-09-17T15:30:09  <mcstar> basically what im saying is that i dont expect some "magic" to happen(i dont think there are deep hidden simplifications) but there will be some tricks on the ai part
2011-09-17T15:32:53  <mcstar> anyway, when there are many players, even colors dont help

2011-09-17T19:18:42  <McLeopold> ok, I think a worker is misbehaving, 198, but don't do anything yet, I'm improving the logging until it makes sense for us
2011-09-17T19:18:59  <janzert> ok
