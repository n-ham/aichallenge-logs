2011-09-14T07:04:18  <contestbot> delt0r__: I come to serve.
2011-09-14T07:05:18  <delt0r__> antimatroid: no I have heard nothing from Tassie.
2011-09-14T07:05:31  <delt0r__> Also my daughter has moved out ;)
2011-09-14T07:05:32  <antimatroid> muggles :(
2011-09-14T07:06:07  <antimatroid> also, was the real world that bad?
2011-09-14T07:06:19  <delt0r__> ??
2011-09-14T07:06:32  <antimatroid> i need to work out what to do next year, i'm thinking phd then working cause academics sounds like such a pita (finding a job)
2011-09-14T07:07:09  <antimatroid> you went out and worked then went back to academia yeah?
2011-09-14T07:07:12  <delt0r__> oh... yea i didn't like it... I will go back if i need to.. i get offers all the time.. but i prefer academia
2011-09-14T07:07:42  <delt0r__> Also i have 400 cores free on our cluster right now... some GA antbot sounds like fun
2011-09-14T07:07:52  <antimatroid> if i can get money to keep playing around with maths for 3 years i'll do that, but not sure what to do after, algo trading /quant work is appealing for the money
2011-09-14T07:08:03  <delt0r__> yea--and stayed working while doing my Masters.
2011-09-14T07:08:34  <antimatroid> australia is annoying, people go straight to phd from honours so there's almost no scholarship money available for masters :(
2011-09-14T07:08:36  <delt0r__> it won't last. HFT is already attracting too much neg publicity...
2011-09-14T07:08:46  <antimatroid> which makes it slightly difficult for people who would like to do a phd in europe
2011-09-14T07:09:10  <antimatroid> HFT has been around for years right? the money wont disappear there's just going to be more people getting their slice
2011-09-14T07:09:12  <delt0r__> well in the EU a masters is what you do when your bork your Diploma
2011-09-14T07:09:26  <delt0r__> antimatroid: no its pretty new
2011-09-14T07:09:30  <delt0r__> like 10 years
2011-09-14T07:09:34  <antimatroid> i was told from a guy at uni of edinburgh that people usually do undergrad, honours and masters before a phd
2011-09-14T07:09:45  <delt0r__> that is the UK
2011-09-14T07:09:47  <antimatroid> i can't imagine people are going to stop using computers for trading :P
2011-09-14T07:10:12  <delt0r__> which is like NZ and Aussie... While mainland EU does the diploma thing
2011-09-14T07:10:13  <antimatroid> but yeah, the market will dilute however one wants to define that
2011-09-14T07:10:20  <antimatroid> ah yeah okay
2011-09-14T07:10:22  <delt0r__> they are supose to change to the masters system
2011-09-14T07:10:46  <antimatroid> people in the us go straight from undergrad to phd :| but undergrad is 4 years and phd often 5 :\
2011-09-14T07:11:22  <delt0r__> No, it will have more "bugs" that require roll backs (HFT) --eventually its going to be time capped... or at least stuffing etc will be pulled
2011-09-14T07:11:31  <antimatroid> obtaining grant money sounds awful, as does having to move every time you get a new job :\
2011-09-14T07:11:43  <delt0r__> I kinda like it
2011-09-14T07:11:49  <delt0r__> but shifting is a PITA
2011-09-14T07:12:58  <delt0r__> getting grants is not really that bad... you apply for 20 and get 1
2011-09-14T07:12:58  <delt0r__> that is just the way it is
2011-09-14T07:13:03  * delt0r__ starts eating lunch
2011-09-14T07:13:23  <antimatroid> :)
2011-09-14T07:55:27  <antimatroid> any game theory fans might like these nontrivially symmetric 3x3 games i made :)

2011-09-14T13:33:37  <mleise> Yes, I was just discussing something with someone in some other channel
2011-09-14T13:34:18  <McLeopold> I want to pass map data to the visualizer.  map.php works, but I can't seem to make my own string in javascript that works
2011-09-14T13:34:39  <McLeopold> I'm using loadReplyData, not from uri
2011-09-14T13:37:59  <mleise> Yes, that should work as documented :p If it doesn't it is a bug. It is used in copy&paste.html as well
2011-09-14T13:38:33  <mleise> So maybe check if you can load your string if you paste it there.
2011-09-14T13:38:34  <McLeopold> I get a "v" expected error
2011-09-14T13:39:01  <mleise> v as in "v 1" ... hmm that sounds like it detects an old-school replay
2011-09-14T13:39:29  <McLeopold> the loadReplayData and loadReplayDataFromURI do different things to the object

2011-09-14T13:40:19  <mleise> Can you post your string somewhere?
2011-09-14T13:40:33  <McLeopold> 'rows 4\ncols 4\nplayers 2\nm .a..\nm ..%.\nm ...b\nm %...\n'
2011-09-14T13:41:10  <mleise> add "v 1\n" :)
2011-09-14T13:41:16  <McLeopold> I did, no cide
2011-09-14T13:41:18  <McLeopold> dice
2011-09-14T13:41:36  <mleise> hmm is this only a map?
2011-09-14T13:42:03  <McLeopold> loadReplayDataFromURL does this: this.replayStr = ''; this.replayReq = undefined; this.loadParseReplay()
2011-09-14T13:42:23  <McLeopold> loadReplayData does this: this.replayStr = ''; this.loadCanvas();
2011-09-14T13:42:28  <McLeopold> yes, only a map
2011-09-14T13:44:01  <mleise> then you don't need "v 1", that is correct, let me check
2011-09-14T13:44:22  <McLeopold> is it expecting json data, not a string?

2011-09-14T13:44:55  <mleise> no it is ok and it seems to work fine in copy_paste.html
2011-09-14T13:45:06  <McLeopold> where is copy_paste.html?
2011-09-14T13:45:27  <mleise> I still support every format we ever used :p - it is in the ants/visualizer directory
2011-09-14T13:46:37  <mleise> I actually wonder why it expects "v" since this is the value I check for to determine wether the string is a map or a replay. And in a map it would not be required
2011-09-14T13:48:03  <mleise> McLeopold: Did you properly construct the Visualizer object?
2011-09-14T13:48:52  <McLeopold> maybe not, I set interactive to true?
2011-09-14T13:49:01  <mleise> that's ok
2011-09-14T13:50:10  <mleise> If copy_paste.html works for you we have something to start with.
2011-09-14T13:57:52  <McLeopold> mleise: it does work for me

2011-09-14T13:59:27  <mleise> ok, so 'visualizer/' contains the 'img' directory, right?
2011-09-14T13:59:49  <McLeopold> yes, this is test_map.php sitting on the website
2011-09-14T13:59:57  <McLeopold> using the min version of visualizer
2011-09-14T14:01:36  <mleise> If you want to disallow fullscreen mode you can add "window.isFullscreenSupported = function() { return false; };"

2011-09-14T14:02:24  <McLeopold> my test server
2011-09-14T14:02:31  <mleise> can I access it?
2011-09-14T14:02:42  <McLeopold> I can push it to the repo

2011-09-14T14:14:07  <McLeopold> mleise: your import function is pulling the wrong import base
2011-09-14T14:14:25  <McLeopold> it's getting http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/
2011-09-14T14:15:06  <mleise> ah shit :p
2011-09-14T14:16:16  <mleise> but that is not the problem with the min version (when did you last rebuild it?)
2011-09-14T14:16:26  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-14T14:16:29  <McLeopold> this is new
2011-09-14T14:16:39  <McLeopold> I'm setting it in code, so don't worry about it
2011-09-14T14:16:46  <mleise> maybe I should look for the <script> that contains 'visualizer.js'
2011-09-14T14:16:56  <McLeopold> but, maybe you could look for the script that is called visualizer?
2011-09-14T14:17:01  <McLeopold> haha
2011-09-14T14:17:02  <McLeopold> jinx
2011-09-14T14:17:20  <mleise> I wanted to keep that function universal
2011-09-14T14:17:57  <McLeopold> okay, so 3 different sources from different uri's all use that import, who's who?
2011-09-14T14:18:02  <mleise> well actually, it can be overriden by setting "var $import_base = 'somewhere'"

2011-09-14T14:19:45  <McLeopold> yes, outdated file
2011-09-14T14:20:02  <mleise> I don't think so
2011-09-14T14:20:15  <McLeopold> but I learned about isFullscreenSupported, which is good
2011-09-14T14:21:22  <mleise> Yes, it is used inside the applet to disable fullscreen, where it is a Java method that returns false.
2011-09-14T14:21:57  <mleise> This also hides the fullscreen button altogether
2011-09-14T14:22:01  <McLeopold> can the visualizer not show zoom and save settings in interactive mode?

2011-09-14T14:23:42  <McLeopold> mleise: I'm looking to have a small map to show example ant positions.  Can the visualizer still show attack radii in non-interactive mode?
2011-09-14T14:24:30  <mleise> The problem first of all is that a map doesn't contain any radii !

2011-09-14T14:29:46  <McLeopold> turning on drag, circle radii
2011-09-14T14:30:17  <McLeopold> It may not be worth it
2011-09-14T14:30:20  <mleise> if i just hide all buttons, then there is no 'center map' function :(

2011-09-14T14:45:08  <mleise> It really is. Don't forget that browser developers also support non-standard stuff to display buggy web sites. This may just be a case where I operate outside the spec of something.

2011-09-14T14:52:33  <mleise> McLeopold: I think that is a problem with the small map size (radius > map size)
2011-09-14T14:52:47  <McLeopold> oh, could be
2011-09-14T14:53:10  <mleise> I am a bit proud of my parser code though, that handles the newly added map parameters out of box :)

2011-09-14T14:55:25  <McLeopold> and the smaller radius did help alot

2011-09-14T16:21:52  <McLeopold> it comes directly from the wiki text
2011-09-14T16:21:57  <amstan> McLeopold: nice
2011-09-14T16:21:59  <amstan> McLeopold: how?
2011-09-14T16:22:08  <McLeopold> check out the last 2 commits
2011-09-14T16:22:09  <amstan> McLeopold: also, how useful is that? lol
2011-09-14T16:22:29  <McLeopold> jQuery selector to function that creates visualizers that load map data
2011-09-14T16:22:32  <amstan> McLeopold: well, it's a cool thing, but it would be more useful in the forums
2011-09-14T16:22:44  <amstan> because on the main site we'll use it like twice
2011-09-14T16:22:51  <McLeopold> Very useful for the last pages we need to write
2011-09-14T16:22:51  <McLeopold> strategy guides and such
2011-09-14T16:23:11  <McLeopold> Explaining the game as well, the current spec sucks balls
2011-09-14T16:23:33  <amstan> last contest we didn't really have strategy guides
2011-09-14T16:23:39  <amstan> nobody wanted to write them
2011-09-14T16:23:48  <McLeopold> well, not it's as easy as writting some text in the wiki
2011-09-14T16:23:51  <McLeopold> now
2011-09-14T16:23:59  <McLeopold> so, anyone can contribute easily
2011-09-14T16:24:02  <amstan> yeah, i guess
2011-09-14T16:24:03  <amstan> ok
2011-09-14T16:24:11  <amstan> problem is that you can't fork wikis
2011-09-14T16:24:15  <McLeopold> so, I think we can launch this weekend, seriously
2011-09-14T16:24:37  <amstan> oh wait, i don't have money on my phone
2011-09-14T16:24:42  <amstan> i retired it like 2 months ago

2011-09-14T16:29:22  <trololo> this weekend!? yippee!!!
2011-09-14T16:29:30  <jnwhiteh> Has anyone gotten the Go sample package to work? I just get a non-useful error message saying the executable wasn't created.
2011-09-14T16:30:12  <amstan> jnwhiteh: can you pastebin it?
2011-09-14T16:30:18  <amstan> jnwhiteh: you sure you compiled it?
2011-09-14T16:30:36  <jnwhiteh> amstan: what do you mean did I compile it?
2011-09-14T16:31:16  <jnwhiteh> The only error given is: Output file /home/contest/compiled/tmp0J6Zha/bot/MyBot was not created.
2011-09-14T16:31:27  <amstan> the compiler tells you this?
2011-09-14T16:31:30  <jnwhiteh> no
2011-09-14T16:31:32  <jnwhiteh> the website
2011-09-14T16:31:36  <jnwhiteh> the program compiles just fine
2011-09-14T16:31:39  <jnwhiteh> on my machine
2011-09-14T16:31:43  <amstan> ic
2011-09-14T16:31:55  <jnwhiteh> there's a bug in the starter package, but I've fixed it
2011-09-14T16:31:58  <amstan> jnwhiteh: a link to your profile might be helpful
2011-09-14T16:32:04  <amstan> McLeopold: can you look into this?
2011-09-14T16:32:07  <jnwhiteh> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=817
2011-09-14T16:32:38  <jnwhiteh> If you download the starter package and upload it, you get no errors or anything, just the message I pasted =)
2011-09-14T16:32:48  <amstan> yeah, that's no good then
2011-09-14T16:32:56  <jnwhiteh> I figured as much, thanks for checking
2011-09-14T16:37:15  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, so there's a bunch of tmps in ~contest/compiled/
2011-09-14T16:37:19  <amstan> McLeopold: i don't think that's right
2011-09-14T16:37:39  <jnwhiteh> ack, that could get messy quick

2011-09-14T16:38:07  <amstan> well, a rm tmp* could fix it
2011-09-14T16:38:10  <amstan> the problem is why this happens
2011-09-14T16:39:48  <amstan> McLeopold: the manager is also off, is that supposed to be off?
2011-09-14T16:40:07  <amstan> i'm guessing so: ProgrammingError: (1146, "Table 'aichallenge.leaderboard' doesn't exist")

2011-09-14T17:13:01  <jnwhiteh> it might be a good time to update the Go starter package as well to one of the more recent releases. The code that's up there uses Split instead of Splitn. You can fix that just by running gofix *.go
2011-09-14T17:13:10  <jnwhiteh> but I'm sure we can work around it =)

2011-09-14T17:19:36  <mcstar> my old bot however has the same code, that my new had before this latest submission
2011-09-14T17:19:43  <mcstar> and it was ranked much lower

2011-09-14T17:55:38  <mcstar> btw i almost crapped myself today
2011-09-14T17:56:21  <mcstar> i was checking my account balance online
2011-09-14T17:56:33  <mcstar> and the site was really crappy slow
2011-09-14T17:57:02  <mcstar> i went to the local store, to buy some, and the system denied my visa electron
2011-09-14T17:57:24  <mcstar> i thought the system is under stress or something
2011-09-14T17:57:35  <mcstar> i went home, checked the e-bank again
2011-09-14T17:57:41  <mcstar> and i couldnt log in!
2011-09-14T17:57:57  <mcstar> i thought wtf something fishy is going on
2011-09-14T17:59:02  <mcstar> i tried to call the hot-line, the machine said they are having technical troubles, and that no personnel is available right now
2011-09-14T17:59:25  <mcstar> so i was nervous that somebody might steal my money

2011-09-14T18:05:58  <McLeopold> I figure I need to scare the beta testers just before launch
2011-09-14T18:06:02  <mcstar> i just recently told amstan my experience that you closed it
2011-09-14T18:06:11  <McLeopold> the calm before the launch storm

2011-09-14T18:09:54  <McLeopold> jnwhiteh: It looks like the SplitN is your bot issue.  I'm trying to think how I can get the useful compiler output to you.
2011-09-14T18:11:09  <mcstar> McLeopold: i didnt know that sound can be a "seaway" too
2011-09-14T18:13:40  <amstan> McLeopold: i guess i should post on the mailing list and the forums about it
2011-09-14T18:13:55  <McLeopold> about what?
2011-09-14T18:14:46  <amstan> McLeopold: the closing of the submissions
2011-09-14T18:15:09  <McLeopold> I wouldn't think so.  We are at a stage where we don't need beta testers.  That's it.

2011-09-14T18:22:55  <jnwhiteh> McLeopold: then the sample project is wrong, that's an easy fix.. but I *did* upload a version with the int64/Split change and got the same output

2011-09-14T18:36:53  <McLeopold> we can launch until daily map generation is working
2011-09-14T18:37:23  <antimatroid> can't*?
2011-09-14T18:38:45  <antimatroid> we also need to pick a length, I know I said 2 months previously but with the amount of time beta testers have had i'd be somewhat inclined to go back to 3 months again
2011-09-14T18:39:01  <antimatroid> regardless if we're launching soonish I wont have time to compete
2011-09-14T18:39:40  <antimatroid> (which I mean as a good thing I think)
2011-09-14T18:41:40  <McLeopold> I'm not picking a length, I'll let jeff do that

2011-09-14T18:42:40  <McLeopold> so we need a way to detect success other than nothing on stderr
