2011-10-06T00:51:37  <janzert> I know it's probably a rather stretch, but I figured we can just pull 'em if any group complained

2011-10-06T00:55:09  <janzert> regarding fpc package did you checkin a changed worker_setup.py that includes it?
2011-10-06T00:57:00  <janzert> ahh, think I see fp-compiler
2011-10-06T00:57:20  <janzert> the workers will pick it up next time ec2 decides to kill them and start new ones

2011-10-06T01:14:07  *** McLeopold1 is now known as McLeopold
2011-10-06T01:14:12  <janzert> no
2011-10-06T01:15:03  <janzert> something specific you want looked at?
2011-10-06T01:15:43  <McLeopold> no, just a general review
2011-10-06T01:15:53  <janzert> just got done with a round trip 7 hours of driving so probably not going to dive into much tonight
2011-10-06T01:15:59  <mleise> I have my Pascal starter bot now, but it acts weird. It makes the engine not ... oh wait. Why do I keep telling people to *flush* the IO buffers all the time...
2011-10-06T01:16:04  <janzert> ok, I'll try and read it tomorrow
2011-10-06T01:16:15  <janzert> mleise: :P
2011-10-06T01:16:27  <McLeopold> janzert: from my perspective, it is tomorrow for you :P
2011-10-06T01:16:50  <janzert> for me tomorrow is whatever time I go to sleep and get back up from more than a nap :)
2011-10-06T01:17:17  <janzert> I don't have a bad sleep schedule, I have no sleep schedule
2011-10-06T01:17:22  <mleise> then again there is seemingly no flush routine in freepascal for stdout
2011-10-06T01:17:28  <janzert> ouch
2011-10-06T01:17:54  <mleise> so either it always flushes or the language wants to make fun of me
2011-10-06T01:18:39  <mleise> wtf? http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/system/flush.html
2011-10-06T01:19:34  <janzert> there example is really scary
2011-10-06T01:20:00  <janzert> apparently it also does internal buffering of file objects?
2011-10-06T01:24:48  <McLeopold> too bad the engine can't invoke the flushing of buffers
2011-10-06T01:26:03  <mleise> It is alright if they buffer, but I should not be forced to assign a dummy file name ('') to a text file pointer to get stdout to flush
2011-10-06T01:26:42  <mleise> usually you have functions for using files that take a file pointer and for stdout that dont take a file pointer, but there is no overloaded flush() with no arguments
2011-10-06T01:26:48  <mleise> anyway it works now :)
2011-10-06T01:27:02  <mleise> just have to figure out why the ants dont move
2011-10-06T01:35:04  <mleise> lack of pascal-fu. I have to pass dynamic arrays by ref to change them inside a function

2011-10-06T02:53:54  <janzert> btw, any idea why we aren't getting a traceback for that Nonetype and str +=?
2011-10-06T02:54:07  <McLeopold> haven't really looked at it yet
2011-10-06T02:54:53  <McLeopold> I guess check the code for a caught exception without re-raising?

2011-10-06T02:59:49  <mleise> janzert: Well, so far I've seen D output 'scheduled for deprecation' warnings and freepascal makes the linker print a warning that is expected and does no harm
2011-10-06T02:59:52  <McLeopold> yes, I set the matchups to a negative worker

2011-10-06T03:45:35  <McLeopold> maybe...let me test vb...
2011-10-06T03:46:06  <mleise> If compile.py really doesn't check for the existence of the output file or the return value of the compiler then Pascal wont work.
2011-10-06T03:46:40  <janzert> it can check for an output file or files
2011-10-06T03:46:54  <McLeopold> instead of stderr?
2011-10-06T03:46:54  <janzert> just can't ignore stderr basically
2011-10-06T03:47:28  <janzert> in fact I think it requires checking for the final bot executable
2011-10-06T03:47:37  <mleise> ld will *always* print: "warning: release/link.res contains output sections; did you forget -T?"

2011-10-06T04:27:47  <mleise> hmmm.... "Output file MyBot was not created." + a *blank* line
2011-10-06T04:28:00  <janzert> heh
2011-10-06T04:28:05  <mleise> did I do something really bad?
2011-10-06T04:28:33  <mleise> I replaced every "MyBot" with the BOT variable
2011-10-06T04:29:28  <mleise> but that should not have any effect
2011-10-06T04:29:32  <janzert> shouldn't matter
2011-10-06T04:30:04  <janzert> I think the blank line means it never got any stdout from the compiler
2011-10-06T04:30:41  <mleise> can you run "fpc -Mdelphi MyBot.pas" on the worker?
2011-10-06T04:30:43  <janzert> heh, I just realized at least one of these workers is probably old enough that it doesn't have the pascal package installed
2011-10-06T04:30:57  <janzert> yeah, about to
2011-10-06T04:31:03  <mleise> yes, I also think it is missing the compiler

2011-10-06T04:34:36  <janzert> yes
2011-10-06T04:35:10  <janzert> starter packages page even says python 2.5
2011-10-06T04:35:15  <janzert> :/
2011-10-06T04:35:37  <aerique> starter packages page is months old
2011-10-06T04:36:01  <mleise> I always update my entries. Look DMD is up to date :)
2011-10-06T04:36:07  <janzert> yeah, obviously before we moved to natty even
2011-10-06T04:36:30  <mleise> "/usr/bin/ld: warning: link.res contains output sections; did you forget -T?"
2011-10-06T04:36:41  <janzert> yay, it works :P

2011-10-06T05:01:41  <aerique> No, it's in a pw manager.  I think we agreed to just disable my access a while ago but I'm not sure.
2011-10-06T05:02:26  <aerique> I could just go by Ubuntu Natty's packages list on their website, that would get most of the versions right I think.
2011-10-06T05:02:35  <McLeopold> yeah, your not in passwd
2011-10-06T05:02:53  <McLeopold> what's the check command?
2011-10-06T05:03:07  <aerique> check command?
2011-10-06T05:03:15  <McLeopold> command to check the version
2011-10-06T05:03:34  <aerique> depends on the programming language, for SBCL it's "sbcl --version"
2011-10-06T05:03:56  <aerique> think it's
2011-10-06T05:04:08  <aerique> "--version" for most of them.  "mono --version"
2011-10-06T05:04:52  <McLeopold> SBCL 1.0.45.0.debian
2011-10-06T05:05:23  <aerique> ought to be scripted actually so starter_packages.php will be generated automatically, or at least the table
2011-10-06T05:05:42  <McLeopold> I mentioned that, janzert thinks it's not worth the effort
2011-10-06T05:07:15  <aerique> so you want to go through all of them with me? :)

2011-10-06T06:39:34  <mcstar> why does a 3xnested iteration ~40x10^6 core-calls with a bit of numpy core take ages?
2011-10-06T06:41:16  <mcstar> i guess it has to do with index regeneration
2011-10-06T06:42:11  <mcstar> should i just generate once the index array, and then slice it for the loops?
2011-10-06T06:42:40  <mcstar> McLeopold: maybe you could answer since you swear by python
2011-10-06T06:42:50  <mcstar> if youre not too busy
2011-10-06T06:46:53  <delt0r_> mcstar: what is slime?
2011-10-06T06:47:11  <mcstar> superior lisp interaction mode for emacs
2011-10-06T06:47:43  <mcstar> basically, this is what makes lisp development great
2011-10-06T06:47:50  <delt0r_> mcstar: also python is quite slow... tight loops with little on the inside is where this becomes very obvious
2011-10-06T06:48:07  <mcstar> i think ive fallen victim of this
2011-10-06T06:48:38  <mcstar> i think it is running for more than 30 minutes
2011-10-06T06:49:24  <delt0r_> I find SBCL a pita to install however
2011-10-06T06:49:35  <mcstar> really?
2011-10-06T06:49:46  <delt0r_> Think i will try clousure --the one that runs on a JVM
2011-10-06T06:49:52  <mcstar> i compiled/installed it wo problems
2011-10-06T06:49:57  <mcstar> clojure
2011-10-06T06:50:01  <mcstar> and THATS the pita
2011-10-06T06:50:04  <mcstar> :D
2011-10-06T06:50:08  <delt0r_> I have never had a clean compile
2011-10-06T06:50:29  <delt0r_> right... well i would prefer a pure Common lisp implementation
2011-10-06T06:50:40  <mcstar> clojure is not common lisp in any way
2011-10-06T06:50:51  <mcstar> if you want cl on jvm, use armed bear common lisp
2011-10-06T06:50:58  <delt0r_> there was going to be on for the jvm --but it never got finished
2011-10-06T06:51:18  <delt0r_> yea that was it... it is finished? or to spec? now?
2011-10-06T06:51:59  <mcstar> ive not used it, but i think its not beta or anything
2011-10-06T06:52:02  <mcstar> its stable
2011-10-06T06:52:10  <mcstar> but dont take my word for it
2011-10-06T06:52:22  <mcstar> delt0r_: sbcl is really easy to install/use
2011-10-06T06:52:29  <mcstar> when did you have trouble with it?
2011-10-06T06:52:36  <delt0r_> not in my experance...
2011-10-06T06:52:44  <mcstar> but when?
2011-10-06T06:52:45  <delt0r_> Always get compile errors
2011-10-06T06:52:54  <mcstar> was it 10 years ago?
2011-10-06T06:52:56  <delt0r_> about 6 months ago was last time i tried
2011-10-06T06:53:01  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-06T06:53:16  <mcstar> whats wrong with using the package manager?
2011-10-06T06:53:20  <delt0r_> I can't spend a lot of time on it... i still need to mostly use java for work
2011-10-06T06:53:22  <mcstar> are you using gentoo?
2011-10-06T06:53:27  <delt0r_> slackware
2011-10-06T06:53:37  <mcstar> so you have to build it from source?
2011-10-06T06:53:42  <delt0r_> package managers suck money ---leaf sacs
2011-10-06T06:53:57  <delt0r_> slack does a package thing --
2011-10-06T06:54:18  <delt0r_> but yea you often build from source... most of the time it works --and you get 64bit
2011-10-06T06:54:31  <mcstar> hey, its finished
2011-10-06T06:54:33  <delt0r_> can't belive most things still are 32 bit
2011-10-06T06:54:56  <delt0r_> like 2001 called and wants its 32bit cpus back
2011-10-06T06:55:07  <mcstar> i dont know what youre talking about
2011-10-06T06:55:11  <mcstar> what is 32 bits?
2011-10-06T06:55:51  <mcstar> all my software is 64bit
2011-10-06T06:55:58  <delt0r_> yea me too
2011-10-06T06:56:12  <delt0r_> but a lot of stuff out there is not build for 64 yet
2011-10-06T06:56:15  <mcstar> i think even flashplugin has a 64bit version
2011-10-06T06:56:25  <mcstar> (yeah, i think i have the 32bit instaleld)
2011-10-06T06:56:28  <delt0r_> just installing humble indie bundle
2011-10-06T06:57:28  <mcstar> well, arch has a multilib repository, i can install 32-bit versions of libraries if its needed
2011-10-06T06:57:56  <delt0r_> slack has a multilib you can install too... which i usally do
2011-10-06T06:58:03  <delt0r_> damit
2011-10-06T06:58:17  <mcstar> what?

2011-10-06T06:59:07  <delt0r_> like i said i didn't have a lot of time
2011-10-06T06:59:40  <aerique> delt0r_: give me shell access to your machine and i'll try to get it running
2011-10-06T06:59:51  <delt0r_> yea right
2011-10-06T07:00:03  <mcstar> you said you couldnt compile it, but a binary package need not compiling
2011-10-06T07:00:04  <delt0r_> root password right... :/
2011-10-06T07:00:10  <mcstar> me too

2011-10-06T07:01:16  <delt0r_> at anyrate --i would not take up the offer... i need to know what its like to install dev envourment and what deployment issue may be like
2011-10-06T07:01:19  <mcstar> delt0r_: if you already java, clojure might fit you well, but be prepared, its not that easy to get it running in emacs
2011-10-06T07:01:22  <aerique> delt0r_: could be a shared screen session.  i don't see why SBCL should be so hard to get running for you

2011-10-06T08:08:05  <mcstar> :D
2011-10-06T08:08:22  <mcstar> lua is Awesome's config language, thats as much as i use it
2011-10-06T08:08:25  <mcstar> why do you recommend?

2011-10-06T08:13:37  <mleise> I don't know much about Lua, but as a math language that is well known, I thought it might be useful here

2011-10-06T08:15:56  <mcstar> oh
2011-10-06T08:16:01  <mcstar> math language?
2011-10-06T08:16:11  <mcstar> i thought its a simple scripting lang.
2011-10-06T08:16:19  <mcstar> like ruby for example
2011-10-06T08:16:23  <mcstar> maybe faster/lighter
2011-10-06T08:16:50  <mcstar> does it have fast numerical routines? or arrays like numpy?
2011-10-06T08:17:00  <mcstar> cause if it doesnt, its out of the question
2011-10-06T08:17:54  <mcstar> (on a personal note, im somewhat saturated with all the different f'ing syntaxes of all these languages, my heart belongs to the lispy ones)
2011-10-06T08:18:42  <mleise> I only used it once, because I needed dynamic equations inside a C app
2011-10-06T08:19:33  <mcstar> like plotting for example? the user could assemble the function to plot?
2011-10-06T08:19:50  <mcstar> or?
2011-10-06T08:20:30  <mleise> yes, like that
2011-10-06T08:24:17  <mcstar> pascal is still in business? i remember they tought that to us in high school
2011-10-06T08:24:19  <mleise> maybe you are right, it is just a simple scripting language

2011-10-06T08:25:39  <aerique> mcstar: doesn't macsyma (or one of those systems for CL) include linalg?
2011-10-06T08:25:45  <mcstar> its just that, as far as i can remember that early pascal was like qbasic, my memory is hazy on this one though
2011-10-06T08:26:09  <mleise> Pascal was always closer to the silicon
2011-10-06T08:26:15  <mcstar> aerique: sure, it does
2011-10-06T08:26:30  <mcstar> but i only skimmed maxima
2011-10-06T08:26:42  <mleise> Maxima would be my next best bet.
2011-10-06T08:26:45  <mcstar> it's syntax is not lisp-liek
2011-10-06T08:27:01  <mcstar> but, yeah, i probably could use it
2011-10-06T08:27:04  <mleise> At least I *know* that it has an integrated solver
2011-10-06T08:27:19  <mcstar> yes, it has many things, im not sure if its fast though

2011-10-06T08:27:37  <mcstar> the thing is, that in the meantime my python code finished

2011-10-06T08:28:33  <mcstar> im going to die in 2075 march ~27 or some like that
2011-10-06T08:28:48  <aerique> mcstar: there's enough maths hits on Cliki but I assume you already checked there? (http://www.cliki.net/Mathematics, http://www.cliki.net/linear%20algebra, https://github.com/blindglobe/lisp-matrix, https://github.com/OdonataResearchLLC/linear-algebra)
2011-10-06T08:28:51  <mleise> mcstar: in that case you can let maxima run for a few years
2011-10-06T08:29:01  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-06T08:29:43  <mcstar> but i have the code in python now, and i started it in cl, but realized i should use python, cause has built-in vector instructions, like dot product

2011-10-06T10:05:10  <mleise> yesterday a german tv show made fun of his religion
2011-10-06T10:05:14  <mleise> and then he dies?
2011-10-06T10:06:03  <mcstar> i dont think the 2 things are related
2011-10-06T10:06:04  <cichociemno> mleise: not exactly ;) He died after 7year of cancer.
2011-10-06T10:06:37  <cichociemno> he is even mention at http://www.google.com/
2011-10-06T10:06:49  <mcstar> i will watch pirates of silicon valley in his memory
2011-10-06T10:06:50  <mleise> oh i didn't know that...
2011-10-06T10:07:39  <mcstar> huh, i use in-addressbar search
2011-10-06T10:07:52  <mcstar> i didnt see the google thing, i found it on wikipedia's main page
2011-10-06T10:08:27  <cichociemno> facebook, g+ and many other services is full of this information,
2011-10-06T10:08:49  <mcstar> i dont use any of them :)
2011-10-06T10:08:57  <cichociemno> but the most ironic is over 200k of "likes" under the information about his death
2011-10-06T10:09:15  <mcstar> is that good?
2011-10-06T10:09:32  <cichociemno> mcstar: I have no idea ;-\)
2011-10-06T10:09:35  <mcstar> why does somebody write like to his death?
2011-10-06T10:09:50  <mleise> its just a button
2011-10-06T10:09:56  <mleise> they dont write that literally
2011-10-06T10:10:06  <mcstar> there are 200k buttons under his name?
2011-10-06T10:10:25  <cichociemno> nope, there is one "like" button, but it was pressed 200k times;)
2011-10-06T10:10:29  <mleise> jeez, i don't talk to you again, ever :)
2011-10-06T10:10:41  <mcstar> mleise: sorry
2011-10-06T10:11:07  <cichociemno> at my workplace there is lot of people who doesn't use any "social" thing;)
2011-10-06T10:11:35  <mcstar> i am antisocial, and its enough to keep up with my handful of friends
2011-10-06T10:11:46  <mcstar> sometimes that is too much too
2011-10-06T10:12:47  <mcstar> anyway, when i read that news, i had a cold feeling

2011-10-06T11:06:45  <george> hi, quick question - in the starter package from hypertriangle ants page ...
2011-10-06T11:07:09  <george> is the test case there ( test_bot.sh )
2011-10-06T11:07:15  <george> the only test i need to pass?
2011-10-06T11:07:32  <george> (i submitted, but apparently failed test cases on server)
2011-10-06T11:07:50  <george> was wondering if the test_bot.sh was the same test?
2011-10-06T11:08:59  <mcstar> ought to be the same
2011-10-06T11:09:49  <george> thanks for your reply - when i visualise the test_bot.sh - game seems to run fine
2011-10-06T11:10:05  <george> (ok, one player is eliminated, but this is just how the game goes)
2011-10-06T11:12:00  <mcstar> im not sure how exactly the that archive you downloaded is generated, i always recommend you test against the latest github version of the toolkit
2011-10-06T11:12:17  <george> ah, github is still the best?
2011-10-06T11:12:22  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-06T11:12:28  <george> ok, i try that then.  thanks.
2011-10-06T11:13:02  <george> (i'd got the impression that contest start was near, so assumed they'd be same now).
2011-10-06T11:13:17  <antimatroid1> it's near but things are updating quite quickly atm
2011-10-06T11:13:56  <george> ok, thanks.
2011-10-06T11:13:56  <antimatroid1> the c++ bot hasn't changed recently though i don't think
2011-10-06T11:13:56  <antimatroid1> or are you using c now? :P
2011-10-06T11:15:37  <george> still c++
2011-10-06T11:16:26  <george> (computer fried some months back - and i'd been somewhat remiss with my backups  :/  )  so starting from scratch ...
2011-10-06T11:16:45  <george> (not that i'd got that far before...)
2011-10-06T11:17:04  <mcstar> another reminder to back up my home
2011-10-06T11:20:58  <antimatroid1> i'm terrible about backing anything up

2011-10-06T12:31:08  <mcstar> is something called a Wulff construction, if you have the surface free energy anisotropy, you can calculate the minimum energy surface, the equilibrium shape of a crystal

2011-10-06T12:41:16  <george> not something for organisers to worry about
2011-10-06T12:41:24  <george> unless many c++ players start asking
2011-10-06T12:41:52  <McLeopold> I will worry about you getting good feedback from the compilation process, but that's as far as I go :)
2011-10-06T12:42:03  <george> no, it is same on both - so not organsier's problem
2011-10-06T12:43:19  <george> but naively using the supplied Bug.h got me in trouble  (seems my c++/motivation isnt good enough to understand why)

2011-10-06T14:54:18  <b0lly> I am trying to run the python playgame script on a centOS 5 (python 2.7) but I get a syntax error in a print statement. Am I missing something obvious?
2011-10-06T14:58:15  <mcstar> you sure its 2.7?
2011-10-06T14:58:35  <mcstar> (check the #! line)
2011-10-06T15:05:04  <b0lly> Ok you are right: the shebang is '#!/usr/bin/env python' which mistakenly I thought was calling the 2.7 since I have installed and made an alias for python to call 2.7 .In the prompt if a just call 'python -V' it reports the 2.7 version
2011-10-06T15:05:38  <b0lly> so what kind of magic does the shebang do that calls the old python?

2011-10-06T15:07:17  <mcstar> where is that alias?
2011-10-06T15:07:23  <mcstar> in the system folders?
2011-10-06T15:07:32  <b0lly> in roots .bash_profile
2011-10-06T15:07:39  <b0lly> i sourced it and even re loged in
2011-10-06T15:09:03  <mcstar> /root/.bash_profile shouldnt run for any other user
2011-10-06T15:09:04  <mcstar> do you mean /etc/bash_profile ?
2011-10-06T15:09:04  <b0lly> playgame runs as another user?
2011-10-06T15:09:04  <b0lly> yes in /root/.bash_profile, not etc
2011-10-06T15:09:04  <mcstar> of course not, as the one that executes it
2011-10-06T15:09:15  <mcstar> i mean what you dont in /root folder has no effect on any other user
2011-10-06T15:09:19  <mcstar> dont->do
2011-10-06T15:09:23  <b0lly> i know
2011-10-06T15:09:47  <b0lly> so
2011-10-06T15:09:47  <mcstar> then i dont understand why did you make that alias there
2011-10-06T15:10:14  <b0lly> because I run play_one_game.sh as root
2011-10-06T15:10:18  <mcstar> lol
2011-10-06T15:10:30  <mcstar> why on earth would you do that
2011-10-06T15:10:35  <b0lly> and I expect the effective environment to take root's .bash_profile into account?
2011-10-06T15:11:01  <mcstar> anyway, env doesnt expand aliases
2011-10-06T15:11:03  <b0lly> because I just setup a VM and went straight to test the ai environmet :)
2011-10-06T15:11:15  <b0lly> aha moment
2011-10-06T15:11:16  <b0lly> thanks and sorry
2011-10-06T15:11:20  <mcstar> and alias in bash for example only expands in literal bash commands
2011-10-06T15:12:14  <b0lly> so I should just useradd  and take care of pyhton2.7 to be first in $PATH?
2011-10-06T15:12:23  <b0lly> in users env?
2011-10-06T15:12:31  <mcstar> if you dont mind, you should rewrite the shebang line in the startup script, i.e. play_one_game.sh to use python2.7
2011-10-06T15:12:50  <mcstar> #!/usr/bin/env python2.7
2011-10-06T15:12:52  <mcstar> thats all
2011-10-06T15:13:05  <b0lly> I tries it
2011-10-06T15:13:08  <b0lly> tried*
2011-10-06T15:13:30  <mcstar> well, you can leave out env altogether
2011-10-06T15:13:36  <mcstar> which python2.7
2011-10-06T15:13:42  <b0lly> but It doesnt work (although I have put puthon2.7 in the PATH)
2011-10-06T15:13:45  <mcstar> and put that path after #!
2011-10-06T15:13:47  <mcstar> that should work
2011-10-06T15:13:51  <b0lly> Ok let me not bother you any more. Thanks a lot
2011-10-06T15:14:01  <mcstar> np
2011-10-06T15:14:06  <b0lly> I m sure I will figure it out
2011-10-06T15:14:11  <b0lly> thanks a lot
2011-10-06T15:14:45  <b0lly> didnt know aliases wherent axpanded by env
2011-10-06T15:15:04  <mcstar> there's another thing with sebangs
2011-10-06T15:15:11  <mcstar> that i just recently discovered
2011-10-06T15:15:27  <mcstar> you cant parameterize your called program, i.e. python in this case
2011-10-06T15:15:42  <mcstar> #!/usr/bin/env python arg1 arg2
2011-10-06T15:16:02  <mcstar> if you want python to recognize arg1 arg2 as two separate parameters, thats not going to work
2011-10-06T15:16:27  <mcstar> python will receive them as 1 parameter, "arg1 arg2"
2011-10-06T15:17:05  <b0lly> thanks a lot :)
2011-10-06T15:17:08  <mcstar> sure

2011-10-06T17:49:10  <mcstar> now this is interesting
2011-10-06T17:49:44  <mcstar> im in the process of porting that python code, which i was talking about earlier, to common lisp
2011-10-06T17:50:25  <mcstar> a part of it, that took at least 30 minutes for python, run in 15secs under sbcl, 5 secs of which was spent on garbage collection
2011-10-06T17:56:53  <amstan_> mcstar: what code?
2011-10-06T17:57:12  <mcstar> you werent here than
2011-10-06T17:58:41  <mcstar> its a 3x nested loop, ~40M evaluations of the core function, which consists of vector-products and trigonometric functions
2011-10-06T17:58:57  <amstan_> you might want to use numpy for that
2011-10-06T17:59:00  <mcstar> i am
2011-10-06T17:59:06  <amstan_> still slow?
2011-10-06T17:59:12  <mcstar> sure :)
2011-10-06T17:59:14  <mcstar> 120x
2011-10-06T17:59:36  <mcstar> it takes me 3-4x more time to write it in common lisp
2011-10-06T17:59:42  <mcstar> but its very fast
2011-10-06T18:00:12  <mcstar> i have to write elementary operations, and have to declare types
2011-10-06T18:00:40  <mcstar> the other parts, that are yet to come will be more interesting
2011-10-06T18:00:51  <amstan_> mcstar: well.. i guess it depends on how much of the code is in python and how much numpy takes care of it
2011-10-06T18:01:08  <mcstar> the problem is with the loop i think
2011-10-06T18:01:15  <amstan_> can i see the code?
2011-10-06T18:01:40  <mcstar> in the first version i used range() for indexing, but i suspect thats bad, cause range() recreates the indices
2011-10-06T18:01:56  <mcstar> and its better to generate them once, and then slice it up for the nested loops
2011-10-06T18:01:58  <amstan_> xrange is much faster
2011-10-06T18:02:06  <mcstar> this will be faster than xrange
2011-10-06T18:02:14  <mcstar> xrange is still an iterator
2011-10-06T18:02:40  <mcstar> but, there might be no difference, i dont know python internals
2011-10-06T18:03:00  <mcstar> i will show you the code later
2011-10-06T18:03:08  <mcstar> i want to finish up my lisp code
2011-10-06T18:03:21  <mcstar> and i need the results, its for a project
2011-10-06T18:03:48  <mcstar> if you are here tomorrow and still interested ill show you
2011-10-06T18:03:58  <amstan_> sure
2011-10-06T18:04:13  <amstan_> python iterators are "supposed" to be optimized
2011-10-06T18:04:51  <amstan_> how does lisp garbage collect?
2011-10-06T18:07:00  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-10-06T18:07:17  <mcstar> well, i guess :)
2011-10-06T18:07:53  <mcstar> garbage is usually created when we cons much
2011-10-06T18:08:19  <mcstar> i.e. creating lists on the fly for temporary purposes
2011-10-06T18:08:36  <mcstar> for example in a loop, im collecting the reults
2011-10-06T18:08:52  <amstan_> yeah, i did some scheme in first year cs
2011-10-06T18:08:58  <mcstar> than i coerce it to a vector, now the list becomes obsolete
2011-10-06T18:09:21  <mcstar> i didnt care much about the GC, i had no problem with it
2011-10-06T18:09:27  <mcstar> i know that its configurable
2011-10-06T18:09:32  <mcstar> but its implementation dependent
2011-10-06T18:09:58  <mcstar> you can delay, or schedule its collection, whatever
2011-10-06T18:10:11  <amstan_> so what method does it use for garbage collecting? i know python does referrence counting for each object
2011-10-06T18:10:18  <amstan_> and when it reaches 0, it gets deleted
2011-10-06T18:10:51  <mcstar> well, in lisp, for lists, theres a great deal of data sharing
2011-10-06T18:11:06  <mcstar> you cant delete something just because theres no reference to it
2011-10-06T18:11:16  <mcstar> parts of other lists can still point to it
2011-10-06T18:11:36  <amstan_> that would still count as a referrence in python
2011-10-06T18:11:41  <mcstar> so that kind of pythonic reference counting will not work
2011-10-06T18:11:57  <mcstar> well, if you mean reference as ANY reference as in a pointer
2011-10-06T18:11:59  *** ibdknox_ <ibdknox_!~ibdknox@50.0.140.105> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-06T18:12:03  <amstan_> yes
2011-10-06T18:12:21  <mcstar> but usually by reference we mean symbols, that reference an object in memory
2011-10-06T18:13:04  <mcstar> so when one part of an object references to another, but that part wasnt named, its an indirect reference
2011-10-06T18:13:06  <mcstar> i think
2011-10-06T18:13:12  <mcstar> anyway, i dont know the internals
2011-10-06T18:16:36  <mcstar> once thing that i know, is that the GC runs periodically
2011-10-06T18:17:00  <mcstar> there can be some "hickupps", when the program pauses to g.c.
2011-10-06T18:17:45  <mcstar> and there was some talk about writing a good GC for sbcl, in a "donationware" fashion or something, Nikodemus came up with it
2011-10-06T18:18:07  <mcstar> he waits for donations or something, than writes the software
2011-10-06T18:18:22  <mcstar> they have another name for it but i dont remember what this development stly was called
2011-10-06T18:18:27  <mcstar> style*

2011-10-06T18:29:03  <amstan_> yes, but then you should go get a coffee while it calcs
2011-10-06T18:29:21  <mcstar> i had a couple of tbbt's, and was talking here
2011-10-06T18:30:02  <mcstar> what i found surprising, is that numpy doesnt provide looping constructs
2011-10-06T18:30:43  <amstan_> mcstar: yeah, i'm sure there's some ways to group stuff together
2011-10-06T18:31:02  <mcstar> amstan_: why would .append() be faster?
2011-10-06T18:31:14  <amstan_> since you're not creating another list
2011-10-06T18:31:37  <mcstar> why doesnt the compiler recognize this?
2011-10-06T18:31:56  <amstan_> += basically does: for i in toadd: self.append(i)
2011-10-06T18:32:13  <amstan_> because it doesn't have a jit, it's not a compiler
2011-10-06T18:32:15  <amstan_> i think
2011-10-06T18:32:25  <mcstar> this is a trivial situation
2011-10-06T18:32:42  <mcstar> i think the code=sytanx should directly expand to a .append() than
2011-10-06T18:32:43  <amstan_> well.. let me check in #python
2011-10-06T18:32:51  <mcstar> code/syntax
2011-10-06T18:34:49  <amstan_> mcstar: what about array+=[newobj1, newobj2]
2011-10-06T18:34:59  <amstan_> you have to do 2 appends for that
2011-10-06T18:35:12  <mcstar> why?
2011-10-06T18:35:20  <mcstar> why not just append the new list?
2011-10-06T18:35:30  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-10-06T18:35:31  <mcstar> i dont know how python stores this internally
2011-10-06T18:35:35  <mcstar> is it a vector?
2011-10-06T18:36:20  <amstan_> mcstar: because this: http://pastebin.com/r9kSkk3z
2011-10-06T18:36:25  <amstan_> mcstar: yes, it pretty much is
2011-10-06T18:37:05  <mcstar> huh?
2011-10-06T18:37:24  <mcstar> what's that supposed to explain?
2011-10-06T18:37:53  <amstan_> mcstar: note the last elements in b and a
2011-10-06T18:38:00  <amstan_> in b, you have c inside a sublist
2011-10-06T18:38:05  <mcstar> i noticed
2011-10-06T18:38:09  <amstan_> in a, c's elements are part of a
2011-10-06T18:38:17  <amstan_> in b, c is itself part of a
2011-10-06T18:38:29  <mcstar> thats why i use a+=[4]
2011-10-06T18:38:31  <mcstar> for example
2011-10-06T18:39:06  <amstan_> thing is that you can't convert a+=c to a.append(c) because they do 2 separate things
2011-10-06T18:39:14  <mcstar> so when you append, put only a number in it
2011-10-06T18:39:16  <amstan_> it'll have to be a+=[c]
2011-10-06T18:39:25  <mcstar> sure
2011-10-06T18:39:25  <amstan_> but then you're making a new list
2011-10-06T18:39:37  <mcstar> that could easily be avoided
2011-10-06T18:39:46  <amstan_> yeah, pypy would probably fix it
2011-10-06T18:40:12  <mcstar> nice suggestions from the python guys
2011-10-06T18:41:08  <mcstar> i left
2011-10-06T18:41:24  <amstan_> lol, yeah, it's a weird channel
2011-10-06T18:41:42  <mcstar> when i ask similar question about lisp, on #lisp, i usually get the answer to use the profiler
2011-10-06T18:41:46  <amstan_> you cannot say lol inthere for some reason, they'll kick you out
2011-10-06T18:41:54  <mcstar> oh
2011-10-06T18:42:05  <mcstar> easier than typing "/close
2011-10-06T18:43:01  <mcstar> a data-structure that can grow, has to be some kind of linked list
2011-10-06T18:43:24  <amstan_> it's probably a tree or something
2011-10-06T18:43:29  <mcstar> nothing guarantees that you can linearly address that structure for all time
2011-10-06T18:43:31  <amstan_> but it acts like a vector of objects
2011-10-06T18:44:05  <mcstar> rich hickey did some good implementations of vectors and hash-maps using trees
2011-10-06T18:44:16  <mcstar> i dont know how much you know about clojure
2011-10-06T18:44:25  <amstan_> nothing
2011-10-06T18:44:34  <mcstar> the data structures in clojure are immutable
2011-10-06T18:44:38  <amstan_> i just know it's lisp under jvm
2011-10-06T18:45:04  <mcstar> thres only one type that is mutable, thats the reference, that you can change using concurrency semantics
2011-10-06T18:45:28  <mcstar> so all this data structures, lists, vectors, maps, they share data
2011-10-06T18:46:00  *** tobym <tobym!~tobym@71.183.248.125> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-06T18:46:10  <mcstar> and the usual time-complexities still hold
2011-10-06T18:46:32  <mcstar> so he made them immutable, but still fast
2011-10-06T18:46:43  <amstan_> question.. how do you create/add to vectors if they're immutable?
2011-10-06T18:46:54  <mcstar> basically a new vector is created
2011-10-06T18:47:03  <mcstar> and you can change your reference to point to it
2011-10-06T18:47:19  <mcstar> but the thing is, that it will share data with the previous one, its not copied
2011-10-06T18:47:20  <amstan_> isn't that O(n)?
2011-10-06T18:47:26  <amstan_> oh, ok
2011-10-06T18:47:56  <amstan_> so your reference consist of a pointer and a length?
2011-10-06T18:48:05  <mcstar> i have no idea
2011-10-06T18:48:12  <mcstar> bt no
2011-10-06T18:48:14  <mcstar> probably
2011-10-06T18:48:24  <amstan_> that's so weird
2011-10-06T18:48:50  <mcstar> the basic memory model that it uses is a software multi-version concurrency model
2011-10-06T18:49:27  <mcstar> you can reference any snapshot of your data structure
2011-10-06T18:50:01  <mcstar> anyway, i only skimmed clojure, looks very promising though
2011-10-06T18:53:51  <amstan_> yeah, i have a bunch of languages i'm looking at
2011-10-06T18:54:24  <amstan_> mostly haskell
2011-10-06T18:54:32  <amstan_> i should get on that sometime
2011-10-06T18:55:54  <amstan_> ugh.. no #python, you don't have to know why..
2011-10-06T18:56:37  <amstan_> so.. i was trying to build this ac circuit calculator in python
2011-10-06T18:57:10  <amstan_> since i was mainly using it in the interpreter, it tought it would be a good idea to change the default printing styles for the builtin float and complex
2011-10-06T18:57:15  <amstan_> yeah, turned out it was a bad idea
2011-10-06T18:57:28  <amstan_> because it's like impossible to do
2011-10-06T18:57:56  <amstan_> then the why came
2011-10-06T18:59:49  <mcstar> sry im tired, i dont follow
2011-10-06T18:59:59  <mcstar> amstan_: what do you mean no #python?
2011-10-06T19:00:24  <amstan_> i was just annoyed at their attitude to more eclectic questions
2011-10-06T19:00:33  <mcstar> right now?
2011-10-06T19:00:38  <amstan_> in general
2011-10-06T19:00:41  <mcstar> ok
2011-10-06T19:01:08  <mcstar> well, cl lets you customize nearly everything
2011-10-06T19:01:20  <mcstar> i dont know if you know, but you can modify readtables
2011-10-06T19:01:29  <mcstar> you can actually add syntax to the language
2011-10-06T19:01:48  <mcstar> like in other languages, a combination of characters means an operator
2011-10-06T19:02:02  <mcstar> and you can change how things are printed as well
2011-10-06T19:02:27  <amstan_> >>> float.__str__=lambda self: "zero all the way"
2011-10-06T19:02:29  <amstan_> TypeError: can't set attributes of built-in/extension type 'float'
2011-10-06T19:02:42  <amstan_> if it's coded in C, you can't..
2011-10-06T19:02:55  <mcstar> cant you supreclass it?
2011-10-06T19:03:00  <amstan_> you can
2011-10-06T19:03:17  <amstan_> let's say you make 'a' an instance of that superclass
2011-10-06T19:03:31  <amstan_> the moment you do a+1.0, it turns back into the original float class
2011-10-06T19:04:04  <mcstar> in c++ you have to overload the +
2011-10-06T19:04:12  <mcstar> but it also controls what type it returns
2011-10-06T19:04:20  <mcstar> how is this different from python's
2011-10-06T19:04:21  <amstan_> yeah, so then i have to overload a ton of things
2011-10-06T19:04:25  <mcstar> ok
2011-10-06T19:04:33  <mcstar> its expected
2011-10-06T19:04:42  <amstan_> including +, -, *, /, the immediate versions too
2011-10-06T19:05:46  <amstan_> it's just a pain though
2011-10-06T19:06:20  <amstan_> i tried making a decorator that overrode a bunch of attributes
2011-10-06T19:06:48  <mcstar> i recently heard about @decorators, but im not sure what they're for
2011-10-06T19:07:16  <amstan_> they're alternative syntax for function=decorator(function)
2011-10-06T19:07:52  <amstan_> for example, you can make a decorator that adds all the decorated functions to an array
2011-10-06T19:08:27  <amstan_> it's useful for stuff like making commands in an interpreter
2011-10-06T19:10:05  <mcstar> argh
2011-10-06T19:10:16  <mcstar> are those the same functions?
2011-10-06T19:10:29  <mcstar> or fun1=decorator(fun2)
2011-10-06T19:10:59  <amstan_> it redefines fun to be the decorated fun
2011-10-06T19:11:12  <amstan_> see this: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/

2011-10-06T19:13:41  <amstan> mcstar: what do you mean?
2011-10-06T19:14:07  <mcstar> what is your development style/what editor you use?
2011-10-06T19:14:39  <amstan> i use kate for editing, and i exec the script until i get the desired results
2011-10-06T19:15:02  <amstan> sometimes i throw it at the interpreter to look around at vars
2011-10-06T19:15:08  <amstan> nothing too advanced
2011-10-06T19:15:56  <mcstar> thats horrible
2011-10-06T19:16:00  <mcstar> sorry
2011-10-06T19:16:03  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-06T19:16:41  <mcstar> developing lisp is really a good feeling, you are in control, and i miss that feeling when i edit python code
2011-10-06T19:16:52  <mcstar> it seems that emacs can do a lot in this regard
2011-10-06T19:17:04  <amstan> it is?
2011-10-06T19:17:14  <amstan> in control how?
2011-10-06T19:17:19  <mcstar> i want to write function, and send it to the runnig interpreter
2011-10-06T19:17:24  <mcstar> try it out instantly
2011-10-06T19:17:34  <mcstar> redefining anything on the fly
2011-10-06T19:17:58  <mcstar> reloading the whole file every time is very rigid
2011-10-06T19:18:19  <mcstar> the problem is that somehow my python-emacs bridge is a bit broken
2011-10-06T19:18:31  <mcstar> i have to setup my python/ipython mode a bit better
2011-10-06T19:18:47  <amstan> yeah, you can't really do that in python, since a bunch of stuff gets in the way
2011-10-06T19:18:53  <mcstar> but i couldnt go back to that development style with a dynamic language, that youre talking about
2011-10-06T19:19:10  <mcstar> i used kate too in my early days
2011-10-06T19:19:28  <mcstar> i liked that it displayed the open files on the side, and had sessions
2011-10-06T19:19:43  <amstan> +1 for embeded terminal!
2011-10-06T19:19:45  <mcstar> and can do code folding
2011-10-06T19:20:03  <mcstar> i never used the e.terminal
2011-10-06T19:20:28  <mcstar> hm, i have 22 windows open
2011-10-06T19:20:32  <mcstar> not much
2011-10-06T19:20:36  <amstan> i use it a lot
2011-10-06T19:20:45  <mcstar> maan, i can only recommend tiling wms
2011-10-06T19:20:58  <mcstar> use whichever you want, but it will help your productivity
2011-10-06T19:21:06  <amstan> i like to keep some kind of small tests at the end of each file that executes when i run the file directly
2011-10-06T19:21:34  <amstan> i have dual screen, so it partially helps
2011-10-06T19:21:46  <mcstar> thats nice too
2011-10-06T19:21:54  <mcstar> how big are they?
2011-10-06T19:21:57  <amstan> i hear kde has some tiling stuff, but i never got around to using it

2011-10-06T19:22:56  <mcstar> im very much considering a 24" screen

2011-10-06T20:22:53  <mcstar> its a vector, of 3, 16bit signed bytes
2011-10-06T20:23:36  <mcstar> make-triple is for making these little vectors without consing
2011-10-06T20:24:13  <mcstar> than i manually compute permutations of not necessarily distinct integers
2011-10-06T20:24:40  <amstan_> but you wrote all this code from scratch?
2011-10-06T20:24:43  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-06T20:24:48  <amstan_> not using any math libraries?
2011-10-06T20:24:53  <mcstar> no
2011-10-06T20:24:59  <mcstar> look at the solve method
2011-10-06T20:25:12  <amstan_> you could try doing that in python next time, then doing pypy on it
2011-10-06T20:25:23  <amstan_> problem with pypy is that it doesn't do numpy
2011-10-06T20:25:41  <mcstar> pypy is the jit?
2011-10-06T20:25:57  <mcstar> ah, thats the python implementation written in python
2011-10-06T20:25:59  <mcstar> right?
2011-10-06T20:27:18  <amstan_> yeah, which is surprisingly faster than python itself
2011-10-06T20:27:36  <mcstar> btw there are packages that provide matrix/vector operations for cl
2011-10-06T20:28:01  <mcstar> next time, or if i do something serious, you can be rest assured, i wont be coding it liek this
2011-10-06T20:29:18  <mcstar> i wonder how long that code is ni J
2011-10-06T20:29:45  <mcstar> ive seen couple of rosetta-code examples in J, really succint
2011-10-06T20:35:11  <mleise> *sigh* http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v3/ I started that in december 2010. We've come a long way from there :)
2011-10-06T20:35:25  <amstan_> mleise: you should put it in the repo
2011-10-06T20:36:00  <amstan_> it's stuck at drawing static scenery for me
2011-10-06T20:36:38  <amstan_> yeah, unlike chrome, where just the tab is stuck, your page takes down the whole firefox
2011-10-06T20:36:39  <mleise> amstan_: could be.. i just had to hack a bit, because of serious bit-rot
2011-10-06T20:36:56  <amstan_> those cosmic rays are a bitch
2011-10-06T20:37:02  <mleise> cool I guess I have a virus of some sort
2011-10-06T20:38:25  <mcstar> haha
2011-10-06T20:38:42  <mcstar> i could stop the script through a poop up window
2011-10-06T20:38:53  <amstan_> yeah, later
2011-10-06T20:39:05  <mcstar> lol, i wrote poop up
2011-10-06T20:39:22  <mcstar> mleise: why are you still up?
2011-10-06T20:39:26  <mcstar> 2:38 here
2011-10-06T20:40:13  <mleise> oh right, because I am an internet junkie
2011-10-06T20:41:51  <amstan_> right.. i should do my laundry
2011-10-06T20:41:58  <amstan_> do garbage, and wash the dishes
2011-10-06T20:42:32  <amstan_> mleise, mleise: oh, what do you guys think of the header minimization?
2011-10-06T20:43:18  <amstan_> me and aarossig hate it
2011-10-06T20:43:22  <mleise> amstan_: it could use some polish. now the word ants is harder to read on the black ants logo
2011-10-06T20:44:07  <mcstar> 2x him or 1x me?
2011-10-06T20:44:24  <amstan_> mcstar: huh?
2011-10-06T20:44:35  <mcstar> are you asking mleise only?
2011-10-06T20:44:41  <amstan_> mcstar: both
2011-10-06T20:45:00  <amstan_> mcstar: oh man.. i did ask him twice, lol
2011-10-06T20:45:15  <amstan_> i was confused for a second there on why you were so humble
2011-10-06T20:45:26  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-06T20:45:49  <mcstar> i think the sign-in sign-up buttons should be on the top of the sidebar
2011-10-06T20:46:28  <mcstar> its good that the headline is smaller, gives room for the content
2011-10-06T20:47:24  <amstan_> i think it's too small right now though
2011-10-06T20:47:35  <amstan_> janzert: toughts?
2011-10-06T20:48:34  <amstan_> @later tell janzert what do you think of the smaller header on the website?
2011-10-06T20:48:34  <contestbot> amstan_: I come to serve.
2011-10-06T20:48:47  <amstan_> i guess that should be @later ask, lol
2011-10-06T20:48:48  <amstan_> k

2011-10-06T20:55:48  <amstan_> mleise: omg do they leave trails?
2011-10-06T20:56:24  <mleise> I just pulled it out again, because someone in a forum asked about it. Yes they left trails :)
