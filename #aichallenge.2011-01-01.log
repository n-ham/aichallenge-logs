2011-01-01T19:28:52  <antimatroid1> and happy new year to you :)
2011-01-01T19:29:17  <delt0r_> well my game is coming along well when i don't have real work to do
2011-01-01T19:29:23  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure there is much point to doing more on ants
2011-01-01T19:29:42  <delt0r_> why is that?

2011-01-01T19:29:59  <antimatroid1> i think people can get a reasonable idea at this point, then if the idea was to be used i think jeff etc. need to go off and decide on a version of the game specifications for themselves
2011-01-01T19:30:07  <antimatroid1> it would be cool to consider some other things though
2011-01-01T19:30:33  <antimatroid1> i might have another go at cleaning the engine up a bit some time
2011-01-01T19:31:06  <antimatroid1> oh, i might play around with the number of ants (and requirements to spawn them) too
2011-01-01T19:31:11  <antimatroid1> atm there are too many
2011-01-01T19:35:09  <delt0r_> well Assuming no more work comes up.. I should get a demo of the RTS game out...
2011-01-01T19:35:44  <delt0r_> Ifs its not picked up I may go for a full game for android and iPhones

2011-01-01T21:24:29  <antimatroid> still recovering
2011-01-01T21:24:30  <antimatroid> you?
2011-01-01T21:24:33  <bhasker> how is your ant game coming along
2011-01-01T21:24:40  <antimatroid> haven't done anything for a while
2011-01-01T21:24:43  <bhasker> been a relaxing holiday here  ...
2011-01-01T21:24:49  <antimatroid> had family stuff over christmas then a 3 day music festival
2011-01-01T21:24:52  <bhasker> ah k
2011-01-01T21:25:12  <bhasker> i have been busy going through some MIT OCW videos
2011-01-01T21:25:20  <antimatroid> which courses?
2011-01-01T21:25:26  <antimatroid> i used to watch them quite a bit
2011-01-01T21:25:45  <bhasker> went through the 600
2011-01-01T21:25:55  <bhasker> and next up is algorithms one
2011-01-01T21:26:11  <bhasker> 600 was just elementary stuff so was mostly skipping through stuff except the knapsack one
2011-01-01T21:26:13  <bhasker> and some other stuff
2011-01-01T21:26:18  <antimatroid> gilbert strangs linear algebra stuff is good
2011-01-01T21:26:40  <bhasker> yea was planning on doing that
2011-01-01T21:26:46  <antimatroid> it's really hard to find good stuff on game theory online :(
2011-01-01T21:27:10  <antimatroid> the linear algebra videos are done from a very applied point of view, but he still covers some important theory
2011-01-01T21:27:38  <antimatroid> my analysis lecturer gave us a 1 hour crash course on vector spaces done right last year
2011-01-01T21:27:40  <bhasker> ah k , i saw the material but i thought i would need to brush some more elementary math before i can tackle that one
2011-01-01T21:27:55  <bhasker> i have forgotten most of my matrices  etc
2011-01-01T21:28:07  <bhasker> all i remember now is that matrics are n*m^
2011-01-01T21:28:11  <antimatroid> i think you should be fine, he goes through intro matrix stuff right at the start
2011-01-01T21:28:15  <bhasker> ah k
2011-01-01T21:29:02  <bhasker> will do that after i finish the intro to algo's videos
2011-01-01T21:29:08  <bhasker> that will keep me busy for a few days
2011-01-01T21:29:18  <bhasker> mostly want to cover the graph theory bit and shortest paths etc
2011-01-01T21:29:32  <bhasker> been covering the initial stuff from the book
2011-01-01T21:31:00  <antimatroid> yep
2011-01-01T21:31:10  <antimatroid> i need to go through and learn graph theory properly some time
2011-01-01T21:31:21  <antimatroid> i can remember how to do shortest paths, but i'm terrible with the theory
2011-01-01T21:31:40  <antimatroid> i would probably perfer to do it with more maths though
2011-01-01T21:32:43  <bhasker> yea same here i am horrible at graph theory
2011-01-01T21:33:03  <SmkMnstr> graphs are too easy, come on guys
2011-01-01T21:33:04  <bhasker> mostly 2-3 things i want to refresh shortest paths, tsp and a couple of other stuff
2011-01-01T21:33:47  <bhasker> not saying they are not easy, just want to refresh my memory :) haven't used them in quite some time
2011-01-01T21:33:55  <antimatroid> SmkMnstr: sure, i've just never gone through and learnt it properly
2011-01-01T21:34:33  <SmkMnstr> yeah :)
2011-01-01T21:34:35  <antimatroid> i just polished off 3 majors in 4 years, i couldn't learn everything in great detail
2011-01-01T21:34:42  <SmkMnstr> get off my lawn !
2011-01-01T21:34:50  <SmkMnstr> hehe
2011-01-01T21:35:07  <bhasker> and now installing matplotlib
2011-01-01T21:35:08  <SmkMnstr> nice one
2011-01-01T21:35:14  <bhasker> to play around with some plots
2011-01-01T21:35:37  <bhasker> have some data to analyze at work and seems that matplotlib is easier to use than plotting using gnuplot
2011-01-01T21:35:51  <bhasker> and the graphs look a lot prettier
2011-01-01T21:39:58  <amstan> happy new year!
2011-01-01T21:41:10  <bhasker> happy new year amstan
2011-01-01T21:41:24  <amstan> ready for ant hive mind?
2011-01-01T21:41:39  <bhasker> are the rules finalized?
2011-01-01T21:41:48  <amstan> no, lol
2011-01-01T21:41:49  <bhasker> i doubt that i wil have time this time though :)
2011-01-01T21:42:02  <amstan> we're still deving it
2011-01-01T21:42:04  <bhasker> we are going to be parents in 3 months :)
2011-01-01T21:42:11  <amstan> oh, cool
2011-01-01T21:42:17  <bhasker> so going to have my hands full
2011-01-01T21:42:41  <bhasker> though i hope to be better equipped with more classical methods by the competition this time around:)
2011-01-01T21:42:54  <bhasker> been brushing up my data structures/algos  :)
2011-01-01T21:45:34  <antimatroid> amstan: happy new year :)
2011-01-01T21:45:55  <antimatroid> i think ants is fairly worked out game wise, you guys could walk away and work out an actual specification
2011-01-01T21:46:05  <antimatroid> but delt0r isn't far off having another proposal example game
2011-01-01T21:46:06  <amstan> that's the plan
2011-01-01T21:46:29  <antimatroid> bhasker: :) on the baby
2011-01-01T21:46:51  <bhasker> thanks:)
2011-01-01T21:47:00  <antimatroid> i'm going to get working on my game theory library again today
2011-01-01T21:47:21  <antimatroid> i pulled parts out of it for my planet wars bot and i will be using it for my honours thesis this year
2011-01-01T21:51:05  <antimatroid> amstan: are there any plans for the new site yet?
2011-01-01T21:51:22  <amstan> antimatroid: yeah, i posted all my ideas on the forums
2011-01-01T21:51:33  <amstan> next thing to do is for me to meet with jeff and discuss things
2011-01-01T21:52:19  <antimatroid> where's the thread?

2011-01-01T22:05:11  <antimatroid> delt0r_: I'm going to make a new ant thread, laying out pretty much what options i think there are for my ant specification, would you like to make a post of your own for what yours was? or are you happy for me to just add in the possible options in one post? i can edit anything you want refined after
2011-01-01T22:06:47  * pgpaskar_ enters

2011-01-01T22:35:08  <antimatroid> i don't like the inconsistency with drawing graphs/indexing matrices/writing on a page
2011-01-01T22:35:33  <antimatroid> you index a matrix like you write on a page, but draw a graph differently
