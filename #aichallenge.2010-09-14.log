2010-09-14T02:00:43  <Queue29> whiteside, try putting everything in a giant try/catch, and catch OutOfMemoryError, and have it send a stack trace to your log file
2010-09-14T02:00:55  <whiteside> they're not throwing exceptions, and if there's any sort of relevant information in there anywhere that would provide more clues, I'm unsure about how to examine it... I don't have much experience with java
2010-09-14T02:01:08  <whiteside> ah, I'll see if I can do that
2010-09-14T02:01:15  <Queue29> stdout and stderror are redirected, so you won't see exceptions or anything
2010-09-14T02:01:52  <whiteside> oh, even with the 1.2 playgame?
2010-09-14T02:02:22  <Queue29> i think so.. it's how the bots communicate with the game manager

2010-09-14T02:04:03  <Janzert> maybe try adding a maximum heap size limit for java, something like "java -Xmx:100m MyBot"
2010-09-14T02:04:45  <Janzert> I guess see if it will even start up with that limit first though :)
2010-09-14T02:05:12  <whiteside> oh, actually I have no idea, I'm using c++ on my personal bot... and for that guy, I just write a log file (but if and only if I detect a file named "safetolog" in the same directory)

2010-09-14T02:07:40  <Janzert> I know earlier in the day all the java bots were crashing on the contest server because a memory limit had been imposed
2010-09-14T02:08:15  <Janzert> and I think that limit may have been 700mb so you may not have any luck at all with 256
2010-09-14T02:09:23  <Janzert> but also I think that limit was imposed outside of the JVM without the JVM's knowledge so working with it may be feasible
2010-09-14T02:10:09  <dstufft> Janzert: no the limit was 196M of Address Space
2010-09-14T02:10:34  <dstufft> Me not ever working with JAva didn't realize that Java addresses 700+mb of shared libs
2010-09-14T02:10:35  <Janzert> ahh
2010-09-14T02:10:58  <dstufft> there are currently no memory limits (besides the fact the box currently only has 2gb of ram in it)
2010-09-14T02:13:24  <rwa> does PlayGame-1.2.jar incorporate the latest battle resolution specs?

2010-09-14T02:45:26  <ratatata> whiteside: probably because it's just some simple iteration
2010-09-14T02:47:38  <whiteside> granted it's trivial, but the two (presumably) same files in the package are inconsistent

2010-09-14T03:23:33  <bss03> antimatroid: I think if my evaluation function (for a planet) was better, the techniques I am using would show better.

2010-09-14T03:23:55  <rwa> off-by-one is the difference between winning and losing if you fail to capture a planet
2010-09-14T03:23:58  <sigh_> I had a bug which made my bot do better, once
2010-09-14T03:24:04  <sigh_> of course, that is rare
2010-09-14T03:24:12  <bss03> antimatroid: Yeah.  It's not harder than I initially thought, but it is getting significantly harder as time goes by.
2010-09-14T03:24:30  <bss03> antimatroid: I feel other bots are getting better much more quickly than my bot.
2010-09-14T03:24:35  <rwa> I already implemented a couple "improvements" that made my bot worse
2010-09-14T03:24:36  <sigh_> well, if you are completely stuck for ideas watch some of the better bots like bartwe or deepblue and see what they do

2010-09-14T03:41:57  <dstufft> greghaynes: ah. Well that's up to jeff then I guess, or amstan
2010-09-14T03:42:00  <rwa> alright, I need timeout code
2010-09-14T03:42:09  <rwa> anybody done something with timeout checking in C++ that worked well?
2010-09-14T03:42:33  <dstufft> i mean more machines arn't strictly required, but if we go distributed, then the more machines/power we got the more games we can run concurrently
2010-09-14T03:42:50  <ratatata> rwa: isn't there something to get the current milliseconds since january1st 1970 as usual?
2010-09-14T03:43:04  <greghaynes> I was sort of hoping this could keep from needing to go distributed
2010-09-14T03:43:32  <dstufft> greghaynes: honestly, pesonally i don't think we need to go distributed at all
2010-09-14T03:43:37  <dstufft> but they are talking about it
2010-09-14T03:43:39  <greghaynes> ratatata: yea, thats a very expensive call though
2010-09-14T03:43:56  <soswow> dstufft: who is they?
2010-09-14T03:44:25  <soswow> contestants?
2010-09-14T03:44:29  <dstufft> soswow: people working on the code/admins, are talking about the possiblity of doing it, not that we are going to though
2010-09-14T03:44:37  <greghaynes> One of the admins seems to really be pushing for it
2010-09-14T03:45:01  <greghaynes> IMO it seems likely to cause a lot of issues
2010-09-14T03:45:58  <dstufft> I don't tihnk it's needed really. I think it was thrown out as an idea when the server kept getting steamrolled
2010-09-14T03:46:02  <greghaynes> If theres no other option though, its understandable
2010-09-14T03:46:06  <soswow> dstufft: why don't you think you need it? And why does it could issues? It's seems atomic action (game between 2 players). Only concurency problem is DB writing score, but it's simple one, isn' it?
2010-09-14T03:46:27  <greghaynes> dstufft: I think so also
2010-09-14T03:46:32  <greghaynes> To both points
2010-09-14T03:47:12  <rwa> I really think distributed is essential.  The sample sizes needed to distinguish closely matched bots are going to be very large.  The current rate of games is like two orders of magnitude off from where it should be.

2010-09-14T03:47:33  <dstufft> soswow: i'm not arguing that it wouldn't allow more games to be played concorently, but I think that a) it add's extra complexity to an already rube goldber esque system, and b) we are unlikely to get many nodes since hosting a node disqualifies you from competeting
2010-09-14T03:47:56  <dstufft> we are currently running 14 games per minute, on a shitbox p4
2010-09-14T03:48:15  <soswow> dstufft: isn't it to small number?
2010-09-14T03:48:20  <greghaynes> Ideally it seems you would want a high game rate and a very level game field, the distributed option makes the level game field a difficult thing to assure
2010-09-14T03:48:22  <rwa> 14 games a minute is horrible
2010-09-14T03:48:23  <ratatata> greghaynes: currentMillis is expensive? between 2 calls of it, I do a whole bunch of stuff and return difference as low as 1-2ms.. is that expensive? (considering that I spent most of that 1-2ms for other calculations)

2010-09-14T03:49:26  <greghaynes> ratatata: Its all relative, that seems like its a higher level language call so they probably abstract it, in C API land it requires a context switch which is expensive
2010-09-14T03:49:39  <soswow> dstufft: Better say how many games average contestant have per minute. 1 in half hour, in hour?
2010-09-14T03:49:45  <soswow> it's not so grate for us

2010-09-14T03:51:23  <greghaynes> ratatata: The server is a linux box, so if you can put a thread to sleep for so many milisecs (using select or some other call) and have it signal to the other thread when it wakes up, it should be farly efficient due to preemption
2010-09-14T03:51:36  <soswow> dstufft: yeah, I know that. But Slow game rate is the problem.
2010-09-14T03:51:54  <dstufft> greghaynes: if I recall you're not allowed to spawn threads, but i may be wrong on that rule
2010-09-14T03:52:00  <greghaynes> ah
2010-09-14T03:52:04  <greghaynes> That would be an issue then
2010-09-14T03:52:10  <soswow> dstufft: If there is 1000 players and there is only 14 games per minute, what is time for one game for each player?
2010-09-14T03:53:02  <dstufft> 14 games a minute is 840 games an hour, each game has 2 players so 1680 players involved each hour
2010-09-14T03:54:11  <dstufft> so 1.68 games an hour on average assuming you schedule it so that it goes round robin (which none of the proposed systems are going to do)
2010-09-14T03:54:16  <dstufft> per player
2010-09-14T03:54:23  <soswow> dstufft: does it mean ~ each player have one game every half an hour?
2010-09-14T03:54:36  <dstufft> soswow: assuming a round robin schedular

2010-09-14T03:55:01  <dstufft> the current game schedular is completly random
2010-09-14T03:55:16  <dstufft> so people can go hours without a game, and then can get 5 games in a row
2010-09-14T03:55:18  <greghaynes> Yea, so that would be the average
2010-09-14T03:55:35  <greghaynes> And you get a gaussian (sp?) dist around that
2010-09-14T03:55:42  <dstufft> that is being changed, but the average will still remain the same

2010-09-14T04:09:32  <greghaynes> Yes, and I was trying to show its actually worse than what you say due to the distribution
2010-09-14T04:10:10  <dstufft> also remember that the current rankings are just there to see how well you're doing, atleast that's my understanding
2010-09-14T04:10:29  <dstufft> i think when we "end" it, we are stopping new submissions, and thenr unning the bots against each other
2010-09-14T04:10:38  <dstufft> for idk how long
2010-09-14T04:10:47  <delt0r_> bayeselo also doesn't really stabilize well. It only takes one outlier to give you a big jump

2010-09-14T04:12:39  <greghaynes> The persons box it is, is actually the secratary of x.org ;)
2010-09-14T04:12:42  <dstufft> it's on a p4 shitbox
2010-09-14T04:12:44  <delt0r_> i would have assumed 16 core... since we have a few 16 core boxes just sitting aroudn
2010-09-14T04:12:58  <delt0r_> oh
2010-09-14T04:13:16  <dstufft> I was talking to quadranet earlier, and I'm going to suggest moving to a new server

2010-09-14T04:13:38  <dstufft> for the same price as the current box
2010-09-14T04:13:39  <dstufft> roughly

2010-09-14T04:14:10  <dstufft> the game runner communicates with the tournament_manager via ssh
2010-09-14T04:14:27  <dstufft> so splitting that out to it's own box isn't terribly hard
2010-09-14T04:16:16  <dstufft> I havn't looked really close at the bot running code, it might not be running paralell bot fights i don't know

2010-09-14T04:17:55  <delt0r_> if a match is duplicated (improbable) its not really the end of the world
2010-09-14T04:18:19  <dstufft> yea
2010-09-14T04:18:32  <dstufft> atm we are pegging the cpu of hte server
2010-09-14T04:18:37  <dstufft> pretty constantly
2010-09-14T04:18:44  <dstufft> well
2010-09-14T04:18:53  <dstufft> loads in the 2-3's
2010-09-14T04:19:11  <delt0r_> if find that load number very uninformative
2010-09-14T04:19:21  <greghaynes> Between a significant # of php requests per sec (with a sig. number of mysql queries each) and running the bots, im not surprised
2010-09-14T04:19:27  <delt0r_> our cluster head node can be at .5 and its slow to respond
2010-09-14T04:19:39  <greghaynes> haha
2010-09-14T04:19:41  <delt0r_> other times it can be at 15 and its really snappy
2010-09-14T04:19:52  <dstufft> i'm hoping that if they let me switch to quadranet, and let me set itup
2010-09-14T04:19:55  <greghaynes> Thats no good, load > .5
2010-09-14T04:19:59  <dstufft> then i can get rid of apache
2010-09-14T04:20:04  <dstufft> and get nginx on board
2010-09-14T04:20:06  <dstufft> with php-fpm
2010-09-14T04:20:11  <dstufft> and varnish
2010-09-14T04:20:13  <dstufft> in front of it
2010-09-14T04:20:23  <dstufft> or memcache
2010-09-14T04:20:39  <dstufft> cache the web requests somewhere
2010-09-14T04:20:49  <dstufft> should ease up the www portion of the box
2010-09-14T04:20:51  <delt0r_> Just wondering why the hardware is ...... so thin? is this more people than you were expecting?
2010-09-14T04:20:53  <greghaynes> That helps some but in my experience its about a 1:100 cpu time usage between server and php itself
2010-09-14T04:21:12  <dstufft> delt0r_: i just started helping like 2-3 days ago
2010-09-14T04:21:23  <dstufft> so I don't know

2010-09-14T04:53:45  <greghaynes> I was considering creating a gaussian distribution centered over player one proportianal to the total number of opponents and determining an opponent out of that
2010-09-14T04:53:51  <Palmik> greghaynes, a1k0n proposed taking X people above you and X under you and random from them. As for picking the first player, you can go for the one who did not play recently. That should be more effective then the current system.
2010-09-14T04:53:54  <greghaynes> Im not sure this is the best tactic though

2010-09-14T04:54:37  <greghaynes> Sounds similar
2010-09-14T04:54:45  <Palmik> Like, the longer you bot did not play, the more likely it is to be picked...
2010-09-14T04:54:59  <Palmik> That only goes for the first player
2010-09-14T04:55:14  <Palmik> The second should be random from the given ranking margin

2010-09-14T04:55:59  <dstufft> currently your ranking is the mean of the range that the bayeselo thinks your ELO would be
2010-09-14T04:56:07  <greghaynes> Palmik: I was proposing to make the first player a choice out of sequentually following user id's
2010-09-14T04:56:19  <greghaynes> Then the opponent would be decided inteligentlyu
2010-09-14T04:56:21  <dstufft> the more games you play, the narrower that gaps become
2010-09-14T04:56:24  <Palmik> dstufft, what is the confidence based on, out of interest :)
2010-09-14T04:56:35  <dstufft> Palmik: that's part of bayeselo i think
2010-09-14T04:56:45  <dstufft> bayeselo is a system that tries to guess what your ELO would be
2010-09-14T04:56:48  <greghaynes> dstufft: Yes, that seems correct, I just dont know of an algo that does this
2010-09-14T04:56:59  <greghaynes> I would imagine there is someone around here who has studied this...

2010-09-14T05:52:58  <delt0r_> c++ is not bad. But its not what i would call a good choice for a  first language.
2010-09-14T05:53:17  <delt0r_> I started with Z80 Assembly !
2010-09-14T05:53:21  <delt0r_> then lisp
2010-09-14T05:53:41  <delt0r_> lisp was hard
2010-09-14T05:53:44  <Baphomet> i didnt actually play myself, its just a copy of another game. http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4464895 but if you look here http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=6239 the bottom 2 are both the same game
2010-09-14T05:54:15  <Baphomet> also thats the fml game where i lose to what im pretty sure is the default bot :(
2010-09-14T05:54:33  <greghaynes> bah, I learned to program using C++.. it makes you really learn memory managemen
2010-09-14T05:54:38  <bartwe_> i
2010-09-14T05:55:02  <bartwe_> why is this user playiong itself so much for the ranking ?http://www.ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=5837
2010-09-14T05:55:05  <delt0r_> greghaynes: as does C or assmbley... I thinking more of OO/class and templates
2010-09-14T05:55:13  <Baphomet> bartwe <3 your bot its sexy to watch
2010-09-14T05:55:28  <greghaynes> No one just learning C++ writes their own templates ;)
2010-09-14T05:55:30  <delt0r_> Its a lot to start with since a lot of code in c++ will all of that
2010-09-14T05:55:34  <greghaynes> Although templates ftw
2010-09-14T05:55:37  <bartwe_> Baohiomet: thanks :)
2010-09-14T05:55:54  <delt0r_> greghaynes: But when you look at code examples.....
2010-09-14T05:56:02  <bartwe_> Baphomet: now if only if it won all rounds .... :)
2010-09-14T05:56:09  <delt0r_> its there and kinda forced on new coders
2010-09-14T05:56:29  <greghaynes> Yea...if youre using C++ as a learning step you should really be using Qt ;)
2010-09-14T05:56:59  <bartwe_> meh, i'd advise a new programmer to learn something basic, python or java
2010-09-14T05:57:02  <delt0r_> and Boost + STL  >)
2010-09-14T05:57:09  <greghaynes> !@#$! boots
2010-09-14T05:57:14  <greghaynes> er. boost
2010-09-14T05:57:23  <delt0r_> bartwe: me too--but you can start with c/c++
2010-09-14T05:57:23  <elijahbal> hello
2010-09-14T05:57:30  <elijahbal> have you a game engine in python ?
2010-09-14T05:57:34  <greghaynes> STL is crap and boost is just overtemplated magic
2010-09-14T05:57:40  <bartwe_> organisers about ?
2010-09-14T05:57:44  <delt0r_> its hard though---but you get the idea of a reference better than if you start with python
2010-09-14T05:57:45  <elijahbal> hello greghaynes
2010-09-14T05:57:52  <greghaynes> Hey
2010-09-14T05:57:53  <bartwe_> templates rock, the compilation model suck
2010-09-14T05:57:58  <elijahbal> did your tcp client been upgraded Q
2010-09-14T05:58:03  <elijahbal> ?
2010-09-14T05:58:13  <delt0r_> greghaynes: My point exatly ... hence evil eyes >)
2010-09-14T05:58:15  <greghaynes> elijahbal: Yep, it does real time visualizatin now
2010-09-14T05:58:28  <greghaynes> :)
2010-09-14T05:58:40  <elijahbal> ok
2010-09-14T05:58:44  <elijahbal> Will try it.
2010-09-14T05:58:45  <bartwe_> Baphomet: does this look bugged to you ? http://www.ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=5837
2010-09-14T05:58:57  <greghaynes> For the speed gain boost template magic gives you its not worth the added API complexity IMO
2010-09-14T05:59:32  <Baphomet> bartwe: yea fo sure theres no why he should be playing the same guy so much
2010-09-14T05:59:47  <Baphomet> theres like 1k players and its suposed to be random?
2010-09-14T05:59:48  <greghaynes> For some systems I can definitely see the advantage though
2010-09-14T05:59:48  <bartwe_> Baphomet: himself... the ids match
2010-09-14T06:00:08  <Baphomet> wait wat lol
2010-09-14T06:00:08  <bartwe_> Baphomet: which has zero information value for the elo score

2010-09-14T06:01:02  <bartwe_> i don't think kicking an admin for a bug is strange
2010-09-14T06:02:34  * delt0r_ kicks bartwe_ for a bug in his code

2010-09-14T06:19:33  <Palmik> animatroids, ok... well, that could work by accessing the member variable directly or  have some getter returning const reference, still you would ne to copy them when filtering etc.

2010-09-14T07:16:19  <kjeldahl> delt0r_: re: Identical strategies giving draws. It doesn't seem to be true. I put DualBot against DualBot, and it's not a draw. It's probably related to "randomness" in how a language sorts identical planets, if distance does not enter into calculations.
2010-09-14T07:17:03  <Naktibalda> Pitel: probably you submited a file with windows line endings
2010-09-14T07:17:29  <Naktibalda> kjeldahl: starting position matters too
2010-09-14T07:17:51  <Naktibalda> if both bots attack the same planet, the first or the second may have a benefit
2010-09-14T07:18:29  <kjeldahl> True, if a planet is put in the square middle of the map...
2010-09-14T07:18:41  <Pitel> Naktibalda: ok, it seems so
2010-09-14T07:19:06  <Naktibalda> simple algorithms are predictable, they allways attack the same target

2010-09-14T07:19:34  <kjeldahl> Or if identical planets are put at identical distances, and both players attack the same planet...
2010-09-14T07:19:51  <kjeldahl> I think at least. :-)
2010-09-14T07:20:05  <kjeldahl> Eh, read that as "I believe...".
2010-09-14T07:20:28  <Naktibalda> it's not so easy add evaluation of distance to standard fomula

2010-09-14T07:27:17  <Naktibalda> if both bots attack the same planet at identical distance, neither can capture it, so a bot with higher growth_rate in initial planet wins, if growth rate is equal, it should result in draw
2010-09-14T07:27:21  <delt0r_> kjeldahl: True--but if there is "randomness" in a bot, then its not really an identical stratagy. Also over a set of games it would show as a draw
2010-09-14T07:28:01  <delt0r_> Naktibalda: Yes it does. My bot did that agaist prospector or something...

2010-09-14T07:28:25  <kjeldahl> delt0r_: Agree. But it's easy to forget the implicit randomness in sorting algorithms when planets rank equal...
2010-09-14T07:28:32  <delt0r_> true
2010-09-14T07:28:45  <delt0r_> stable sort? quick sort? etc
2010-09-14T07:30:08  <delt0r_> also kjeldahl i think if the behavior is implicit with fleet order, you get player order dependence too
2010-09-14T07:30:19  <kjeldahl> delt0r: Regarding your comments over a set of _identical_ games, I would expect that the kind of "sorting randomness" I hinted at would make the one instance of similar bots to win every time, i.e. not a draw.
2010-09-14T07:30:52  <delt0r_> could do
2010-09-14T07:31:17  <kjeldahl> Which basically boils down to sorting randomness not being random at all. :-)
2010-09-14T07:31:28  <delt0r_> but its not what i would expect if there is not "extra state" or player order dependance
2010-09-14T07:31:35  <kjeldahl> Agree.

2010-09-14T08:01:31  <kjeldahl> It's a pain in the ass that the java gamehost filters out stderr. Makes it a lot harder to catch errors of various kinds.

2010-09-14T08:09:18  <kjeldahl> Pitel: Yeah, sounds like some poor IO model. I have no idea really, other than I got lots of timeouts as well when trying to port a bot to Clojure, and since the gamehost owns stderr without showing it, there were lots of easy to fix errors that I struggled to catch.

2010-09-14T08:30:10  <kjeldahl> Accoun: The game host (PlayGame) used to suck up all stderr output, which is where error messages from bots gone wild goes. The versions from a1k0n fixes that, so stderr is now echoed through the game host. I.e. lets you see what is going on.

2010-09-14T09:07:19  <amstan_> Baphomet: what language?
2010-09-14T09:07:20  <blister> It's not a big deal, I pay like, $0.15/gb, but I see from log.txt that it's sending a pretty huge gamestate stream and was worried that tcp.c might be a fairly heavy bandwidth hog
2010-09-14T09:07:22  <Baphomet> c++
2010-09-14T09:07:25  <amstan_> awww
2010-09-14T09:07:43  <askhader> blister: How would you mitigate this, assuming you're correct?
2010-09-14T09:07:44  <Baphomet> i have pw.Distance working, just not sure how to integrate that with the dest finding calculatins

2010-09-14T09:08:06  <blister> heh
2010-09-14T09:08:10  <Baphomet> or how i can use to it find the closest/furthest
2010-09-14T09:08:55  <Naktibalda> measure distance to all planets and find shortest
2010-09-14T09:09:09  <pgpaskar_> wifi is soooo laggy

2010-09-14T09:09:46  <Naktibalda> Baphomet: foreach(other_planets) { if(distance < min_distance) { min_distance = distance; min_planet = planet; } }
2010-09-14T09:09:50  <antimatroid> my thing is still really buggy though D:
2010-09-14T09:09:56  <Baphomet> how can i pass all the diferent souce and dest planets through pw.Distance() and extract the lowest val?

2010-09-14T09:35:47  <sigh> at least that's what the site says

2010-09-14T09:36:01  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-14T09:36:06  <amstan_> and to save cpu cycles

2010-09-14T10:46:30  <anoek> yep you download the tcp.c file he provides, then run your unmodified bot and the tcp program launches your bot, connets to the server, adn does all of that

2010-09-14T10:46:59  <anoek> odinsbane: no, the username is just for stats collecting, you don't need to create an account anywhere.. the password is optional as well

2010-09-14T10:48:29  <odinsbane> Baphomet: you just need to be able to compile it.  You could probably do it with ming.
2010-09-14T10:48:42  <antimatroid> there is a java file that you just need in the same folder as your bot .exe
2010-09-14T10:48:51  <antimatroid> then just run a command though normal command prompt
2010-09-14T10:49:08  <anoek> so anyone have any idea what version of gcc we are using?
2010-09-14T10:49:46  <Baphomet> it doesnt compile, dont have all the includes

2010-09-14T10:58:55  <jmcarthur> bartwe_, dstufft: the current algorithm we are looking at picks a bot with a wide confidence interval and then pairs it with a bot near it in rank, but with a long tail so we still get the occasional wild game
2010-09-14T10:59:10  <jmcarthur> at least, i think that's what we are agreeing to try
2010-09-14T11:02:23  <odinsbane> So I used java with a bash script.  Should I get the results afterwards, or do I have to go online to see what happened?

2010-09-14T11:06:38  <bartwe_> jmcarthur: just checking, you explicitly check so that a bot does not fight itself
2010-09-14T11:07:20  <jmcarthur> bartwe_: no idea
2010-09-14T11:07:32  <bartwe_> jmcarthur: a binary search strategy for new bots would be a quick way to find a good starting point
2010-09-14T11:07:37  <jmcarthur> bartwe_: that is certainly something to watch for in the future scheduler. i have no idea about the current one
2010-09-14T11:08:07  <jmcarthur> bartwe_: no, the confidence interval is going to be better than binary search because we also are uncertain about the ranks of the bots we are "inserting" the new bot into
2010-09-14T11:08:59  <jmcarthur> it would be like trying to use binary search to insert an element into an unsorted array
2010-09-14T11:10:37  <jmcarthur> my preference would be to favor matches where the bots' confidence intervals have the greatest overlap, but we have to admit some more variety in the matches, so the close-rank-with-long-tail version will work

2010-09-14T11:22:52  <Baphomet> nice antimatroid ;)
2010-09-14T11:23:23  <Obeleh> i meant why would you want to win with like 200 rounds   50 is better
2010-09-14T11:23:46  <jmcarthur> Obeleh: but would you go out of your way to change your strategy so that that happens at the risk of having a bot that overall performs worse?

2010-09-14T11:24:12  <Naktibalda> Baphomet: has your bot any intelligence? it looks like it sends 6 ship fleets to all sides
2010-09-14T11:24:18  <Obeleh> i think it broadens the game yes
2010-09-14T11:24:42  <antimatroid> i still have lots to add to mine, so i'm glad it's at least doing alright off of data and a few well chosen heuristics
2010-09-14T11:24:44  <Baphomet> I try :(
2010-09-14T11:24:57  <Baphomet> I havnt worked out how to factor distance into the dest calculation yet

2010-09-14T11:26:04  <Baphomet> i also havnt worked out how to make my planets send fleets to diferent locations in a single turn
2010-09-14T11:26:17  <Baphomet> so when they attack all my planets shoot for the same dest :(

2010-09-14T11:27:55  <dstufft> Obeleh: if you factor in how many MORE ships a player wins by, then you provide incentive for a bot to "win" by getting the opponent down to one planet, and sending in ships to cull the herd, but not enough to take it over
2010-09-14T11:28:10  <dstufft> and then just sit and do nothing until the turns run out where you finally destroy them

2010-09-14T11:29:22  <danielvf> and then picks a random bot that close to you in rankings
2010-09-14T11:29:30  <Obeleh> just give more points to someone who wins in fewer rounds sounds fair to me

2010-09-14T11:31:13  <rogue780> antimatroid, be careful though, I do believe there is an upper-limit to the number of fleets you can send at once...
2010-09-14T11:31:27  <antimatroid> rogue780: since when?
2010-09-14T11:31:51  <Naktibalda> since rogue780 lost to PHP bot :)
2010-09-14T11:31:56  <rogue780> since around ~450 fleets causes most games to time out

2010-09-14T11:49:35  <Janzert> danielvf: is the change to not choose a random first player for a match being delayed for later?

2010-09-14T11:52:42  <Obeleh> koooool
2010-09-14T11:52:44  <Janzert> also I'm wondering why the magic array of numbers for pickable_spread instead using one of the distributions from the random module?

2010-09-14T11:53:17  <dstufft> danielvf: instead of Random should we instead try and pick someone who hasn't played a game?

2010-09-14T11:56:55  <a1k0n> danielvf: it'd be awesome if you could get the Elo score of the opponent in the profile page games list (i have a patch but it runs to slow on the db)
2010-09-14T11:56:59  <jmcarthur> danielvf: i think maybe they should be, but they aren't right now unless something has changes
2010-09-14T11:57:00  <a1k0n> danielvf: they aren't.
2010-09-14T11:57:06  <jmcarthur> *changed
2010-09-14T11:57:12  <danielvf> jmcarthur: At the moment it just picks a random starting bot

2010-09-14T11:57:29  <Obeleh> i agree with a1k0n
2010-09-14T11:57:36  <jmcarthur> oh, i believe it should at least pick a bot based on how long it's been since the last game it played
2010-09-14T11:57:44  <danielvf> a1k0n: it's using the rank from the scoring rankings.
2010-09-14T11:57:52  <danielvf> a1k0n: rank, not score
2010-09-14T11:58:05  <jmcarthur> better would be confidence interval based i think, but that would be more work, and i don't think it matters *too* much
2010-09-14T11:58:11  <a1k0n> no, i mean the score of all the people you've played, not your own score
2010-09-14T11:58:12  <danielvf> a1k0n: but should have the same effect, right?

2010-09-14T12:04:00  <McLeopold> You'd probably want to choose opponents who's high and low confidence barely overlap.
2010-09-14T12:04:32  <Janzert> 1/3 of the time it will be farther, but do you want the standard deviation larger or are you wanting a flatter distribution?
2010-09-14T12:05:01  <Janzert> maybe the standard deviation should be a percentage of the total number of submissions?
2010-09-14T12:05:21  <Janzert> 5-10%?
2010-09-14T12:05:43  <retybok> challenge guys: why do you give the compile log on success, but not on failure? It would seem more useful to do the contrary :)

2010-09-14T12:13:17  <delt0r___> yea
2010-09-14T12:13:32  <dstufft> so no reason not to use gauss since it's faster

2010-09-14T12:17:56  <a1k0n> hmm.  laplace is an interesting idea
2010-09-14T12:18:01  <delt0r___> a1k0n: that would be best done with a mixture model

2010-09-14T12:18:27  <a1k0n> delt0r___: in other words, just use a normal distribution X% of the time and uniform 100-X%

2010-09-14T12:19:35  <a1k0n> well it kind of establishes a baseline such that the difference in ranks between the top player and the bottom player doesn't require inferring from a chain of 500 different games

2010-09-14T12:34:19  <Janzert> danielvf: if you're around here is the modified while loop for choosing opponents using a1k0n's method http://pastebin.org/868110
2010-09-14T12:34:38  <a1k0n> what is it doing now?  uniform +/- 10 ranks or something?
2010-09-14T12:35:23  <Janzert> uniform using a magic array to choose the distance
2010-09-14T12:35:43  <Janzert> see http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=151
2010-09-14T12:35:45  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: it picks a range from an array randomly, then picks a bot within that range randomly
2010-09-14T12:35:51  <jmcarthur> iiuc

2010-09-14T12:36:39  <a1k0n> oh.  huh.
2010-09-14T12:36:57  <a1k0n> kindof approximates a laplace distribution or something.
2010-09-14T12:37:06  <a1k0n> a steppy one.
2010-09-14T12:37:19  <Janzert> time for work, later all
2010-09-14T12:37:35  <jmcarthur> something like that. i didn't pay attention to the actual distribution. it just had that tail i was looking for
2010-09-14T12:37:53  <jmcarthur> (i didn't write that code, in case my language implies otherwise)
2010-09-14T12:38:24  <a1k0n> wtf?  a geek squad repair unit just showed up here.  how embarassing.
2010-09-14T12:38:31  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-14T12:40:10  <a1k0n> it's actually kinda clever.  i wonder how well it works.
2010-09-14T12:40:26  <jmcarthur> probably is reasonable

2010-09-14T12:40:54  <a1k0n> you're going to get a shitton of games against the same people, but that's probably good as it establishes correct probabilities of winning
2010-09-14T12:41:15  <jmcarthur> i'd be most interested in the games i keep losing anyway
2010-09-14T12:42:28  <jmcarthur> if eventually about half of my games are losses then that's probably a sign that the scheduler is working well
2010-09-14T12:42:42  <jmcarthur> the sooner it gets to that point the better
2010-09-14T12:43:00  <jmcarthur> maybe that could be a good criteria to check for as we try to nail this down
2010-09-14T12:43:09  <jmcarthur> it's not as important as getting an accurate rank though

2010-09-14T12:47:26  <jmcarthur> i bet a lot of people further down do want a chance to play some top bots every once in a while

2010-09-14T12:47:36  <jmcarthur> that obviously can't be the only thing we look for
2010-09-14T12:48:09  <jmcarthur> but if we could perhaps weight the choice based on distance from top in addition to distance from bot, maybe that could lead to interesting matchups?
2010-09-14T12:48:17  <jmcarthur> for the lower ranks at least
2010-09-14T12:49:08  <edcba> why not just random pairings ?
2010-09-14T12:49:10  <jmcarthur> it might be bad though because it means lower ranked bots might be more starved for games
2010-09-14T12:49:28  <jmcarthur> edcba: that's what we did up to today and it has led to uninteresting, uninformative games
2010-09-14T12:49:57  <jmcarthur> edcba: we need games to cause the score to narrow in more quickly, and we need the games to be more interesting matchups
2010-09-14T12:50:23  <edcba> ok then swiss
2010-09-14T12:50:59  <evgenius> another idea if you don't mind: when you submit a new version of you bot, why not give you a starting rating the same as it was before submission? it's too painful to get through ranks as games are played too rare

2010-09-14T12:52:09  <jmcarthur> evgenius: the ratings are updated in batches based on games played. there is no seed value

2010-09-14T12:53:06  <jmcarthur> evgenius: at the most it would buy you one game close to your original rank, but it won't be informative enough to keep you there
2010-09-14T12:53:09  <deepblue> morning
2010-09-14T12:53:21  <jmcarthur> evgenius: no, the batch jobs completely recalculate based solely on games played
2010-09-14T12:53:25  <edcba> official should use swiss seems no brainer :)
2010-09-14T12:53:46  <jmcarthur> edcba: it's not that simple
2010-09-14T12:54:01  <edcba> why ?
2010-09-14T12:54:07  <jmcarthur> edcba: the scoring system is a bayesian estimate of your eventual elo score. our goal is to narrow in on that more quickly
2010-09-14T12:54:21  <jmcarthur> edcba: it's not just a "add points when you win" kind of deal

2010-09-14T12:56:02  <jmcarthur> edcba: this is a bayesian estimate of it
2010-09-14T12:56:08  <Obeleh> I just played a match on the tcp server. How do I find it? my username is Obeleh
2010-09-14T12:56:20  <jmcarthur> Obeleh: go to your profile
2010-09-14T12:56:23  <jmcarthur> oh tcp
2010-09-14T12:56:30  <Janzert> edcba: also there are no real rounds, since new submissions are constantly coming in and sometimes replacing old ones
2010-09-14T12:56:32  <jmcarthur> Obeleh: sorry, just look at the rankings and find your name
2010-09-14T12:56:41  <mightybyte> evgenius: Using the previous rating as an estimate for a new version's rating seems reasonable but can totally fail, as happened to me years ago when I accidentally introduced a bug into my chess program that effectively changed the eval to "return 0;"
2010-09-14T12:56:42  <Obeleh> its not there (yet?)
2010-09-14T12:56:46  <jmcarthur> Obeleh: give it time

2010-09-14T13:02:44  <Janzert> edcba: I imagine mostly because bayeselo is freely available, pretty easy to integrate and well regarded
2010-09-14T13:03:05  <jmcarthur> edcba: it arrives at fairly close numbers more quickly
2010-09-14T13:03:11  <jmcarthur> important for testing your bot
2010-09-14T13:04:53  <a1k0n> swiss pairings could still be done with bayeselo running later, but it doesn't really work if everyone's submitting bots at different times
2010-09-14T13:05:18  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: re: that forum post.  unsure.  might make sense to give the top players more games just so they have to defend their title more
2010-09-14T13:05:27  <jmcarthur> yeah...
2010-09-14T13:05:29  <jmcarthur> i am also unsure
2010-09-14T13:05:35  <jmcarthur> i would want to test it first
2010-09-14T13:05:54  <jmcarthur> to see what effects it might have
2010-09-14T13:06:17  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i think the weights suggested are far too heavy though
2010-09-14T13:06:19  <a1k0n> a mixture model sounds pretty ideal here: we could have some element of uniform game picks, some element of nearby rank picks, and some element of p(rank) ~ 1/rank or so
2010-09-14T13:06:31  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-14T13:07:13  <jmcarthur> i would still like to toy with rankings where confidence interval is available as a variable too, but that can wait
2010-09-14T13:07:37  <jmcarthur> i want to see what trueskill's matchmaking formula would end up being like when applied to bayeselo
2010-09-14T13:08:34  <jmcarthur> it's calculates the probability that a given pair of players should play against each other based on how "fun" the game is likely to be, where "fun" means "likely to draw". not sure how well that applies here
2010-09-14T13:09:25  <Baphomet> is it alright that i run the tcp one on a loop so im always playing?
2010-09-14T13:09:31  <jmcarthur> Baphomet: yes
2010-09-14T13:09:35  <Baphomet> im pretty sure a few other guys are going it anyway
2010-09-14T13:09:36  <jmcarthur> Baphomet: although i might make a suggestion:
2010-09-14T13:09:43  <Baphomet> maybe a wait?
2010-09-14T13:09:51  <jmcarthur> Baphomet: put a delay in your loop so you have a chance to stop it without forfeiting a game
2010-09-14T13:10:11  <Baphomet> good idea
2010-09-14T13:10:26  <jmcarthur> Baphomet: also try to pick a delay that others are "unlikely" to pick so that you might get some more variety in your matchups
2010-09-14T13:10:32  <jmcarthur> since a lot of people use delays too

2010-09-14T13:20:05  <jmcarthur> Baphomet: if yours did mersenne primes then it does more than mine
2010-09-14T13:20:13  <a1k0n> isn't that a little general for numbers?
2010-09-14T13:20:27  <jmcarthur> who said (2*) was just for numbers?
2010-09-14T13:20:36  <jmcarthur> who says the whole idea can't be for more general things?
2010-09-14T13:20:45  <jmcarthur> it's the haskell way to generalize
2010-09-14T13:20:47  <a1k0n> the 1 on the end there
2010-09-14T13:20:54  <jmcarthur> 1 is not just integers
2010-09-14T13:21:01  <a1k0n> ok ok, i give in
2010-09-14T13:21:13  <jmcarthur> haskell has overloaded numeric literals
2010-09-14T13:21:38  <Baphomet> Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/Tgen9UVJ
2010-09-14T13:21:52  <jmcarthur> they are read as Integers and then fromInteger is implicitly applied
2010-09-14T13:22:07  <jmcarthur> and something similar for decimal numbers
2010-09-14T13:22:32  <Baphomet> The main problem was, even when using an unsigned long int it still wasnt big enough considering the mersenne primes are like 10+ digits long after the 7th one
2010-09-14T13:22:51  <jmcarthur> Baphomet: yeah you need to use a bignum library or something to do it for larger numbers
2010-09-14T13:22:54  <jmcarthur> or roll your own

2010-09-14T13:25:17  <delt0r___> I got some strange behavour when i was testing with my own player
2010-09-14T13:25:21  <hornairs> its so weird, if i run the command my tournament program runs, pitching my bot against an example bot, my bot times out. if i run the command in my shell it works fine, and if i run the command pitching two example bots against each other it times out and doesn't do anything, process never exits but nothing comes out on its stdout/err
2010-09-14T13:25:39  <hornairs> that last example is run programatically that is
2010-09-14T13:25:53  <delt0r___> It was due to the fact that I expected the proccess to keep the jvm alive
2010-09-14T13:25:56  <delt0r___> its doesn't
2010-09-14T13:26:22  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: as a basic example of a sensible generalization of the arithmetic operations, they could operate on functions that take some parameter and return a number. for example (+5) * (+1) could be applied to 2 and you would get 21 as the result
2010-09-14T13:26:29  <delt0r___> as the jvm shuts down it also closes the std in and err and out ect. The bot sees and eof and exits
2010-09-14T13:26:43  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: although that is actually still what we think of as arithmetic. there are other kinds of mappings that could make sense too
2010-09-14T13:26:48  <a1k0n> yes yes

2010-09-14T13:30:26  <Baphomet> i like how everyone assumes im on linux.
2010-09-14T13:30:33  <Baphomet> win xp ftw :D
2010-09-14T13:30:37  <a1k0n> yes, i meant on windows
2010-09-14T13:30:43  <a1k0n> i think cmd suupports sleep, doesn't it?

2010-09-14T13:31:41  <bartwe> so ehmz, what tactics do you guys use to avoid losing to much to neutrals ?
2010-09-14T13:31:43  <a1k0n> must be
2010-09-14T13:32:05  <a1k0n> bartwe: if you leave them alone they leave you alone. :)
2010-09-14T13:32:38  <delt0r___> never lost to a neutral ? :D
2010-09-14T13:32:41  <bartwe> a1k0n: well, you want growth rate, also you want to not lose units to neutral when you can lose them against the enemy
2010-09-14T13:33:05  <a1k0n> right.  so you can try to wait for your opponent to send ships to neutrals and then follow up on the next turn
2010-09-14T13:33:08  <bartwe> not attacking neutral sounds a bit.... wastefull
2010-09-14T13:33:08  <samulihs> haha, this is funny :) http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284484499|sambot|deepblue

2010-09-14T13:34:02  <hellman> lal
2010-09-14T13:34:05  <bartwe> it prefers to drain it seems
2010-09-14T13:34:08  <a1k0n> just bouncing huge fleets around
2010-09-14T13:34:08  <bartwe> works just as well
2010-09-14T13:34:27  <a1k0n> it's randomly flitting 4000 ships around, holy crap
2010-09-14T13:34:45  <McLeopold> it sent 15 at the end
2010-09-14T13:34:52  <damag> Defense is the best offense? =/

2010-09-14T13:39:56  <a1k0n> including fleets
2010-09-14T13:40:16  <bartwe> which makes sense
2010-09-14T13:40:25  <McLeopold> So then, you don't need to ever go for the kill.
2010-09-14T13:40:47  <bartwe> if you knew how long the game would take, and your sure of the superior growth rate
2010-09-14T13:41:30  *** bhowmisu <bhowmisu!~sudeep@unaffiliated/bhowmisu> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2010-09-14T13:41:58  <a1k0n> it's true.  i guess it might have been too risky to do it in that situation.
2010-09-14T13:41:58  <jmcarthur> you don't need to know the length of the game if you know your growth rate is superior
2010-09-14T13:42:10  <delt0r___> bartwe: Yea -- if your own more that half the growth rate... and have the same or more ships. Then turtle...
2010-09-14T13:42:13  <McLeopold> Unless your comming from behind.
2010-09-14T13:42:56  <delt0r___> but a concentrated attack could still remove planets from you...turtleing would be that easy
2010-09-14T13:43:01  <bartwe> thats the problem, different tactics for different opponents
2010-09-14T13:43:18  <delt0r___> wouldn't be that easy
2010-09-14T13:43:52  <McLeopold> I suppose it depends on the map if you can turtle or not.
2010-09-14T13:44:11  <eburnette> Is there a way for a bot to surrender if it knows it can't win? Might save some cpu time. I tried issuing a 0,0,0 order but benzedrine's server didn't kill me
2010-09-14T13:44:17  <jmcarthur> if a concentrated attack removes a planet from you then it's still easy to counter after an epic turtle like that
2010-09-14T13:44:41  <jmcarthur> eburnette: i don't think i would do that. there's always a chance that the opponent screws up
2010-09-14T13:44:56  <jmcarthur> like, crashes or something
2010-09-14T13:45:00  <a1k0n> eburnette: maybe just do something extremely desperate, like launch all ships at one planet of theirs
2010-09-14T13:45:31  <jmcarthur> i would just try to hold out for as long as possible if at all possible
2010-09-14T13:45:36  <jmcarthur> more time for opponent to make a mistake
2010-09-14T13:45:49  <a1k0n> yeah this is no place for altruism, heh
2010-09-14T13:45:54  <eburnette> I don't count opponent crash as a true win
2010-09-14T13:46:01  <jmcarthur> eburnette: the server does
2010-09-14T13:46:31  <eburnette> I know, but if I'm losing at move 30 I'd rather give up than watch 170 more moves inch by
2010-09-14T13:46:42  <jmcarthur> you don't have to watch it :P
2010-09-14T13:46:47  <Naktibalda> you have no fighting spirit
2010-09-14T13:47:03  <eburnette> I have a debugging spirit
2010-09-14T13:47:16  <a1k0n> eburnette: if you ^C the game it will count as a loss
2010-09-14T13:47:18  <jmcarthur> just watch the first 30 and then let it be while you debug the first 30
2010-09-14T13:47:27  <jmcarthur> yeah and it's interactive just do that
2010-09-14T13:47:29  <jmcarthur> *if it's
2010-09-14T13:47:45  <a1k0n> so yeah, you can just disconnect to forfeit
2010-09-14T13:47:56  <a1k0n> which finally answers your original question
2010-09-14T13:48:05  <jmcarthur> eburnette: yeah you could always just divide by zero if you want to do it programmatically :)
2010-09-14T13:48:11  <jmcarthur> or exit
2010-09-14T13:48:11  <a1k0n> (or just exit())
2010-09-14T13:48:22  <jmcarthur> dividing my zero is more epic
2010-09-14T13:48:25  <jmcarthur> *by
2010-09-14T13:48:31  <jmcarthur> mine too though
2010-09-14T13:48:43  <eburnette> I'll try exiting. If it were C++ I'd *((char *)null)=0 :)
2010-09-14T13:49:18  <jmcarthur> eburnette: you should make sure to send a polite "gg" first ;)
2010-09-14T13:49:32  <a1k0n> hah!  there could be a 'gg' command instead of 'go'
2010-09-14T13:49:46  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: we don't even have to modify the engine
2010-09-14T13:50:00  <a1k0n> i think that would just get ignored
2010-09-14T13:50:15  <jmcarthur> really? bad syntax doesn't kill the bot?
2010-09-14T13:50:29  <jmcarthur> kill in the losing sense
2010-09-14T13:50:55  <a1k0n> i don't remember
2010-09-14T13:51:45  <jmcarthur> my bot happens to ignore things it doesn't understand, but i would think that a tournament engine would be more strict

2010-09-14T14:10:43  <jmcarthur> a little complex to implement maybe, but we don't have to worry about >2 players and stuff
2010-09-14T14:11:24  <jmcarthur> but trueskill has the benefits of bayeselo, and also comes with all the little ideas i've been proposing for our bayeselo setup like reporting with lower confidence bound and even has a matchmaking formula
2010-09-14T14:11:34  <jmcarthur> i don't know of any libraries for it though :(
2010-09-14T14:11:38  <jmcarthur> just papers and articles

2010-09-14T14:12:47  <danielvf> This seems like the best thing yet.
2010-09-14T14:12:52  <jmcarthur> there appears to be a ruby library for it, at the top of my google search for trueskill library
2010-09-14T14:12:55  <eburnette> bots are noticeably tougher today compared to last night
2010-09-14T14:13:04  <phreeza> jmcarthur: I saw a java implementation of it somewhere
2010-09-14T14:13:09  <phreeza> let me look...
2010-09-14T14:13:10  <jmcarthur> danielvf: we'd definitely need to test it hard before using it
2010-09-14T14:13:42  <danielvf> jmcarthur: Yeah, I won'nt just drop this one in on the server.
2010-09-14T14:14:06  <jmcarthur> danielvf: i don't know how quickly bots would rise to the top, etc. i also don't know if the mathmaking algorithm would make sense for us since it's optimized for "fun" (likelihood of draw) rather than for nailing down a rank quickly
2010-09-14T14:14:17  <jmcarthur> danielvf: either way, it is designed to nail it down fairly quickly at least
2010-09-14T14:14:28  <jmcarthur> *matchmaking

2010-09-14T14:20:53  <pgpaskar_> they send age of empires taunts?
2010-09-14T14:20:58  <phreeza> hehe yea
2010-09-14T14:21:00  <jmcarthur> pgpaskar_: i dunno just a broadcast thing to teammates
2010-09-14T14:21:11  <jmcarthur> ascii strings or something
2010-09-14T14:21:19  <xvinyl> pgpaskar_: that would be so great
2010-09-14T14:21:27  <pgpaskar_> 30 -- where is my mother?
2010-09-14T14:21:30  <pgpaskar_> 15 -- alahaha
2010-09-14T14:21:34  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-14T14:21:37  <pgpaskar_> 16 - im in ur base... killin ur dudes..
2010-09-14T14:21:41  <phreeza> hehehe
2010-09-14T14:23:42  <pgpaskar_> i should update bash
2010-09-14T14:23:43  <jmcarthur> danielvf: btw, if you are pursuing trueskill, i told somebody the other day that trueskill adapts to changing skill levels over time. i was wrong. that's a different scoring system. so if somebody mentions that when you talk about it you can correct them for me :)
2010-09-14T14:23:47  <pgpaskar_> 3.2.48 on osx....
2010-09-14T14:23:51  <jmcarthur> i don't remember who i told that to
2010-09-14T14:24:10  <danielvf> jmcarthur: It really doesn't adapt to changes over time?
2010-09-14T14:24:22  <jmcarthur> danielvf: not that i'm aware of
2010-09-14T14:24:29  <jmcarthur> danielvf: after reading over how it works i don't see how it could
2010-09-14T14:24:39  <danielvf> jmcarthur: I'll be on the lookout for that then
2010-09-14T14:24:42  <jmcarthur> danielvf: it just models uncertainty very well with an incremental algorithm
2010-09-14T14:24:58  <jmcarthur> danielvf: and has other nice things that we need like leaderboard generation and matchmaking :)
2010-09-14T14:25:21  <danielvf> At least in the summary they were talking about "surprises" affecting rankings a lot.
2010-09-14T14:25:32  <jmcarthur> yeah, but elo does too. that's nothing all that unique
2010-09-14T14:25:43  <jmcarthur> they just include uncertainty in with the surprises
2010-09-14T14:25:49  <danielvf> Yeah, this needs to both generate leader boards and generate matches.
2010-09-14T14:26:00  <jmcarthur> it's still will always *narrow* the confidence interval. i don't think it ever widens it

2010-09-14T14:26:07  <jmcarthur> widening would be necessary to adapt to changing skill
2010-09-14T14:27:20  <jmcarthur> danielvf: another nice thing is that the matchmaking will pit new bots against established average bots rather than against other new bots
2010-09-14T14:27:22  <danielvf> jmcarthur: will be on the lookout

2010-09-14T14:28:30  <danielvf> jmcarthur: Ah
2010-09-14T14:32:53  <jmcarthur> i guess in a sense it does something like binary tree insertion for new bots when establishing mean skill, but reports the lower confidence bound so they still appear to be rising in the ranks rather than jumping around

2010-09-14T14:35:38  <hornairs> how do you guys feel about a 1 second grace period at the start of the game for library loading and initialization?
2010-09-14T14:36:07  <danielvf> hornairs: there may be something like that already in
2010-09-14T14:36:26  <hornairs> it could be before the map is sent so you cant get an edge by precomputing
2010-09-14T14:36:44  <hornairs> but maybe each bot should say ready before the first state is sent or something?

2010-09-14T14:37:33  <danielvf> Yeah
2010-09-14T14:37:51  <jmcarthur> hornairs: the first turn is 3 seconds long
2010-09-14T14:37:57  <jmcarthur> hornairs: after that is 1 second
2010-09-14T14:38:06  <odinsbane> It seems like players can die, even if they still have a fleet.
2010-09-14T14:38:09  <hornairs> is that respected in showgame?

2010-09-14T14:39:34  <Zannick> but it waits 2 seconds for the startup
2010-09-14T14:39:37  <deepblue> the first turn is longer?

2010-09-14T14:40:00  <jmcarthur> ah okay
2010-09-14T14:40:14  <jmcarthur> i think i put that in the spec wrong then
2010-09-14T14:40:24  <deepblue> so not 2 seconds more for the first round
2010-09-14T14:40:32  <deepblue> it's two seconds for your bot to load up right?
2010-09-14T14:40:36  <Zannick> yes
2010-09-14T14:40:45  <Zannick> such as the jvm
2010-09-14T14:40:49  <jmcarthur> Zannick: the last paragraph of Bot I/O is wrong then, isn't it? http://ai-contest.com/specification.php#bot-io
2010-09-14T14:41:07  <Zannick> jmcarthur: yeah, slightly
2010-09-14T14:41:26  <rogue780> I hope you all know my grades are going to plummet because of this contest
2010-09-14T14:41:35  <jmcarthur> it's certainly something that may lead some to program their bots in a way that will make them crash
2010-09-14T14:41:43  <Zannick> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/engine.py#287
2010-09-14T14:42:00  <Zannick> 2 seconds to spin up
2010-09-14T14:42:05  <Zannick> then each turn is 1 second
2010-09-14T14:42:19  <jmcarthur> i wonder if it worked that same way in the last contest
2010-09-14T14:42:29  <jmcarthur> that would explain why my bot timed out so much
2010-09-14T14:42:44  <Zannick> you'd have to ask someone who was here for that
2010-09-14T14:42:45  <jmcarthur> i was just flatly told that the first turn was 3 seconds, at the time
2010-09-14T14:43:42  <HakanD> well, thats what i understand from the docs
2010-09-14T14:44:16  <jmcarthur> HakanD: if you mean for this contest, i wrote those docs with an incorrect understanding of it ;)
2010-09-14T14:44:22  <jmcarthur> i'm making a patch now
2010-09-14T14:44:41  <HakanD> yep i mean this contest (:
2010-09-14T14:45:00  <jmcarthur> HakanD: well, fyi, the first turn is still just 1 second. sorry about that
2010-09-14T14:45:32  <HakanD> np, glad to figured that out sooner
2010-09-14T14:45:51  <HakanD> I ll play with it a bit to get it right
2010-09-14T14:47:28  <bartwe> hmz, thinking of going with a total reimplementation
2010-09-14T14:47:42  <bartwe> this sucks

2010-09-14T14:50:20  <bartwe> however that became problematic when enemies started to wait for the other to grab neutrals first

2010-09-14T15:07:23  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: it's more of a mini-starter. i'm not working about adding any convenience functionality. i'm just implementing some details from the spec and that's it

2010-09-14T15:08:20  <danielvf> On the server? or localy?
2010-09-14T15:08:58  <alexshendi> On the server, of course.  Locally is no problem.
2010-09-14T15:09:44  <dstufft> alexshendi: no
2010-09-14T15:09:47  <ulope> Hm.. maybe MyBot.sh ? ;)
2010-09-14T15:09:53  <Zannick> for the tcpserver, yes
2010-09-14T15:10:02  <Vi0> anyone have a fixed bashscript tot test against examplebots with a1k0n new playgame and showgame
2010-09-14T15:10:13  <dstufft> the server compiles and runs a command to start your bot based on the language
2010-09-14T15:10:44  <retybok> alexshendi: why would you want to do that?
2010-09-14T15:10:56  <bartwe> ughs, bugs bugs bugs
2010-09-14T15:11:02  <HakanD> also it runs in the sandbox to prevent hacks
2010-09-14T15:11:53  <danielvf> jmcarthur: "Before starting to determine the new skill beliefs of all participating players for a new game outcome, the TrueSkill ranking system assumes that the skill of each player may have changed slightly between the current and the last game played by each player."
2010-09-14T15:12:16  <jmcarthur> danielvf: ah, yeah, it does do that
2010-09-14T15:12:16  <alexshendi> retybok: To add command line arguments.
2010-09-14T15:12:25  <jmcarthur> danielvf: but it does that uniformly between all matches
2010-09-14T15:12:33  <retybok> alexshendi: hard code them
2010-09-14T15:12:48  <jmcarthur> danielvf: we could remove that and simply add some uncertaintly artificially upon resubmission though
2010-09-14T15:12:52  <alexshendi> Is ANSI C acceptable?
2010-09-14T15:12:53  <jmcarthur> would have the same effect
2010-09-14T15:12:57  <retybok> (for the submission only, of course!)
2010-09-14T15:13:05  <danielvf> jmcarthur: exactly
2010-09-14T15:13:14  <jmcarthur> danielvf: that would be nice. we should do it :)
2010-09-14T15:13:41  <danielvf> It looks like the uber complicated parts of trueskill are the multi players on a team
2010-09-14T15:13:44  <danielvf> We don't need that
2010-09-14T15:13:47  <jmcarthur> yeah, which we don't care about
2010-09-14T15:14:12  <danielvf> I can't read their paper - too much greek.
2010-09-14T15:14:15  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-14T15:14:32  <jmcarthur> the web page is simple enough though i think
2010-09-14T15:14:36  <danielvf> Yeah
2010-09-14T15:15:00  <xvinyl> danielvf: do you actually want to keep track of the player's rank and not bot skill ?

2010-09-14T15:15:27  <danielvf> *wise
2010-09-14T15:15:39  <jmcarthur> no, you want to track both
2010-09-14T15:15:47  <danielvf> jmcarthur: Why?
2010-09-14T15:15:49  <xvinyl> danielvf: well, one 'plus' for the TrueSkill is, as jmcarthur said
2010-09-14T15:16:07  <jmcarthur> we want to report the rank as the lower confidence bound, but we can't do that unless we track all variables
2010-09-14T15:16:17  <xvinyl> danielvf: uncertainty over skill always decreases
2010-09-14T15:16:22  <jmcarthur> in the db we actually want to store the mean and uncertainty
2010-09-14T15:16:24  <danielvf> You only have to track sigma and whatever the other one is
2010-09-14T15:16:32  <xvinyl> danielvf: mu :)
2010-09-14T15:16:48  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: what we were talking about a second was to increase uncertainty when somebody uploads a new version of their bot
2010-09-14T15:16:49  <danielvf> xvinyl: no, unceranty goes up on submission, and possibly a tiny bit before each game
2010-09-14T15:16:57  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: rather than starting over from scratch
2010-09-14T15:17:00  <McLeopold> Except for the message passing, the TrueSkill algo isn't too bad.
2010-09-14T15:17:09  <danielvf> xvinyl: Thanks
2010-09-14T15:17:16  <jmcarthur> danielvf: not before each game. we don't need that

2010-09-14T15:17:37  <xvinyl> danielvf: my point is : a bot's skill never changes
2010-09-14T15:17:44  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: exactly
2010-09-14T15:17:48  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: we should still do it upon resubmission though

2010-09-14T15:18:21  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: so that they can go ahead and play similarly ranked players without having that rampup period
2010-09-14T15:18:32  <danielvf> jmcarthur: exactly
2010-09-14T15:18:35  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: but while still acknowledging that their skills may have changed
2010-09-14T15:18:44  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: yep :) what i mean is
2010-09-14T15:19:04  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: i think this algorithm finds the good skill level pretty fast
2010-09-14T15:19:14  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: *right skill level
2010-09-14T15:19:34  <ath888> Hmm. Does planet growth get added before or after fights?
2010-09-14T15:19:34  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: yeah, but it will always tighten the confidence interval unless we artifically loosen it

2010-09-14T15:20:06  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: again, if we are ranking bots and not players, confidence intervals should always tighten
2010-09-14T15:20:15  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: except for resubmission
2010-09-14T15:20:21  <jmcarthur> in which case they should loosen
2010-09-14T15:20:36  <McLeopold> danielvf: no, not on github, i'd have to dig it up
2010-09-14T15:20:49  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: so our choices are to (a) reset all values for a bot upon resubmission, (b) increase uncertainty upon resubmission, or (c) do nothing upon resubmission
2010-09-14T15:20:58  <danielvf> Ah. I may ask you later for it.
2010-09-14T15:21:06  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: we are not considering adding uncertainty between games for the same version of the bot
2010-09-14T15:21:13  <bartwe> woop, inverted condition in cost function
2010-09-14T15:21:17  <bartwe> that won't help....
2010-09-14T15:21:43  <McLeopold> increase uncertainty, that is how trueskill did it.
2010-09-14T15:21:49  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: i see it this way : each time a player uploads a new bot, it's just like if it was a new player
2010-09-14T15:21:56  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: well, trueskill proper does it between every game, which is wrong for us
2010-09-14T15:22:09  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: but it's not. it's highly likely to just be a changed version of the old one
2010-09-14T15:22:13  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: which is just like a skill change
2010-09-14T15:22:43  <McLeopold> TrueSkill was based on time.  You should probably use a constant.  Assume a new bot will move 100% closer to high and 50% closer to bottom.
2010-09-14T15:23:03  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: why do it at all though?
2010-09-14T15:23:10  <HakanD> just curious, what about a sandbox period, 2-3 matches maybe, after resubmission?
2010-09-14T15:23:10  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: bots don't change skill over time unless you resubmit
2010-09-14T15:23:11  <retybok> and don't change the mean, I guess
2010-09-14T15:23:22  <jmcarthur> retybok: no, you never change the mean artificially

2010-09-14T15:23:40  <McLeopold> If you have a tight deviation, then a new bot will move up the ranks slower if it never gets to play good bots.
2010-09-14T15:23:53  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: point
2010-09-14T15:24:10  <McLeopold> If a bad bot gets improved, one game against a top player will tell you much more than serveral along the way.
2010-09-14T15:24:12  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: ok so you assume each player's successive bots will be around the same level with slight alterations in level
2010-09-14T15:24:13  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: but once it's up there then it should not have a problem staying there even after resubmission
2010-09-14T15:24:17  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: makes sense
2010-09-14T15:24:17  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: yeah

2010-09-14T15:24:43  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i'm just saying it's okay if the bot moves up slowly overall as long as it doesn't drop drastically between resubmissions
2010-09-14T15:24:45  <jmcarthur> okay
2010-09-14T15:24:50  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: we are in agreement then
2010-09-14T15:24:54  <McLeopold> ;)
2010-09-14T15:25:21  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: we can pretty drastically increase the uncertainty without a huge penalty

2010-09-14T15:26:17  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: one risk, though, is that in the case your new bot is actually worse than your previous one, you won't see it immediately
2010-09-14T15:26:25  <McLeopold> A zero growth planet has been the bain of my bots existence.
2010-09-14T15:26:31  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: it would just mean that rank upon resubmission is low, but the bot will still get to play some higher ranked bots as we narrow back in on its score

2010-09-14T15:26:53  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: no, you'll see it because the mean is more "mobile" when the uncertainty is high

2010-09-14T15:31:36  <jmcarthur> danielvf: the formula just takes two players info and spits out a number between 0 and 1
2010-09-14T15:31:40  <danielvf> Right
2010-09-14T15:31:45  <jmcarthur> danielvf: where 1 is "awesome match" and 0 is "terrible match"
2010-09-14T15:32:10  <danielvf> which would mean to find the best next match would be num players squared ish
2010-09-14T15:32:13  <xvinyl> danielvf: i guess it's pretty much a scaled difference of ELO ranks
2010-09-14T15:32:19  <jmcarthur> it's not that slow. i'm suspecting you mean "can we change it to take multiple players as input and spit out some matches"

2010-09-14T15:32:42  <jmcarthur> danielvf: here's how i think we should do it...
2010-09-14T15:32:51  <McLeopold> Are you talking about the trueskill match prediction?
2010-09-14T15:32:58  <xvinyl> McLeopold: yup
2010-09-14T15:33:04  <jmcarthur> danielvf: we should make a pool of players that haven't played in a while, then pick the best match out of that pool
2010-09-14T15:33:08  <McLeopold> I don't think you want close matches at all.
2010-09-14T15:33:17  <McLeopold> I might be wrong...
2010-09-14T15:33:31  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: isn't the match prediction also tuned for picking matches that tighten the confidence interval quickly?
2010-09-14T15:34:06  <danielvf> McLeopold: We do want to try to get close matches
2010-09-14T15:34:07  <jmcarthur> danielvf: so the algorithm would still be n^2, but for a smaller number of players
2010-09-14T15:34:12  <McLeopold> No, i think it's for picking the matches that involve very closely ranked bots.
2010-09-14T15:34:19  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: not really
2010-09-14T15:34:41  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: rank is a different idea from mean in this case
2010-09-14T15:34:59  <McLeopold> Which would in turn tighten the confidence interval if it was right.
2010-09-14T15:35:00  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: a new bot has rank 0, but its mean is actually at the halfway point, so it will be matched with an average bot
2010-09-14T15:35:11  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: right. we want that
2010-09-14T15:35:20  <McLeopold> Oh good, you calculating rank as mean - u
2010-09-14T15:35:34  <jmcarthur> mean - 3*stddev, iirc
2010-09-14T15:35:49  <danielvf> Basically if deep blue beats a starter bot, you gain no information about deep blue, and just that starter bot is not a top level bot
2010-09-14T15:35:51  <jmcarthur> or is it variance?
2010-09-14T15:35:53  <jmcarthur> don't remember
2010-09-14T15:36:09  <jmcarthur> danielvf: right, and that matchup would also probably not be picked
2010-09-14T15:36:23  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: std dev in this case
2010-09-14T15:36:34  <jmcarthur> we can try these scenarios with that link that danielvf pasted earlier
2010-09-14T15:36:40  <jmcarthur> since it shows quality of match
2010-09-14T15:36:59  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: some other measures use variance actually, but i don't think it would be of interest here
2010-09-14T15:37:02  <McLeopold> I suppose if 2 bots have tight deviation, you won't gain much from matching them up.  The don't have a chance to move up.

2010-09-14T15:50:47  <danielvf> jmcarthur: Ah.
2010-09-14T15:50:47  <McLeopold> If you always pick high sigma, you'll never match them to bad bots, except for an unknown bad bot.
2010-09-14T15:51:04  <danielvf> High sigma for the first bot
2010-09-14T15:51:10  <jmcarthur> i think that's a bad idea
2010-09-14T15:51:19  <jmcarthur> i think it should just always be between two bots that haven't played in a while
2010-09-14T15:51:20  <danielvf> then look for match
2010-09-14T15:51:46  <danielvf> Once all the bots have sigma pushed down, then it will start to play around
2010-09-14T15:51:46  <McLeopold> The first bot should be one that hasn't played, then find a good match.
2010-09-14T15:52:03  <jmcarthur> danielvf: the first bot should be the bot that has played the least recently, IMO
2010-09-14T15:52:10  <McLeopold> I agree
2010-09-14T15:52:15  <jmcarthur> danielvf: and the bot to match with should be matched by trueskill formula
2010-09-14T15:52:28  <jmcarthur> we actually don't have to do a pool for that i guess
2010-09-14T15:52:34  <danielvf> jmcarthur: won't that result in the bot playing the same other bots over and over?
2010-09-14T15:52:48  <danielvf> jmcarthur: With no change in ranking?
2010-09-14T15:52:49  <McLeopold> You could check for that.
2010-09-14T15:52:49  <jmcarthur> danielvf: only when it's the seed bot
2010-09-14T15:53:01  <jmcarthur> danielvf: if another bot is the seed then it's likely to get more variety
2010-09-14T15:53:08  <McLeopold> No rematches for 10 rounds?
2010-09-14T15:53:09  <jmcarthur> since the seed bot will tend to have more uncertainty anyway

2010-09-14T15:56:09  <McLeopold> for bot in submissions: go

2010-09-14T15:57:16  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: new bots are always the least recently seeded ;)
2010-09-14T15:57:23  <McLeopold> doh
2010-09-14T15:57:28  <jmcarthur> danielvf: just once
2010-09-14T15:57:31  <jmcarthur> danielvf: then pick a new seed
2010-09-14T15:57:37  <jmcarthur> danielvf: most fair to new submissions, i think
2010-09-14T15:57:45  <jmcarthur> danielvf: plus, we don't want to build up a huge queue
2010-09-14T15:58:00  <danielvf> That would make a new bot take a while to get settle, while settled bots get the same amount of time
2010-09-14T15:58:06  <danielvf> *settled
2010-09-14T15:58:14  <jmcarthur> danielvf: hmm, point
2010-09-14T15:58:34  <jmcarthur> we should at least bias it for least recently seeded, but maybe give some priority to new bots too
2010-09-14T15:58:36  <McLeopold> Bot with lowest confidence?
2010-09-14T15:58:54  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: we want all bots to get a chance to seed though
2010-09-14T15:58:58  <danielvf> McLeopold: That's what I was originally thinking
2010-09-14T15:59:02  <jmcarthur> that won't work
2010-09-14T15:59:05  <McLeopold> That would include new bots.
2010-09-14T15:59:10  <jmcarthur> bots that have been around for a while would never get to seed
2010-09-14T15:59:19  <danielvf> But they would still be played against
2010-09-14T15:59:28  <jmcarthur> yeah, but uncertain bots
2010-09-14T15:59:32  <jmcarthur> they would never get to progress
2010-09-14T15:59:36  <jmcarthur> &by uncertain bots
2010-09-14T15:59:38  <jmcarthur> **by
2010-09-14T15:59:41  <McLeopold> okay 50% low conf, 50% last seed
2010-09-14T16:00:04  <McLeopold> new bots are low conf and would get a few matches right away
2010-09-14T16:00:04  <danielvf> McLeopold: Something like that seems reasonable.
2010-09-14T16:00:05  <jmcarthur> i think confidence shouldn't play into it
2010-09-14T16:00:43  <jmcarthur> i think bots should be guaranteed some maximum amount of games the server run before choosing that bot for another game
2010-09-14T16:00:45  * danielvf really has to work - darn for being freelance
2010-09-14T16:01:17  <jmcarthur> i also don't think it's so bad for bots to take a while to rise in the ranks
2010-09-14T16:01:24  <jmcarthur> because they won't drop so fast upon resubmission anyway
2010-09-14T16:01:34  <jmcarthur> since we are just increasing uncertainty rather than starting over
2010-09-14T16:01:56  <McLeopold> unless you new bot divides by zero...
2010-09-14T16:02:01  <jmcarthur> so i'm sticking to my "seed with the least recently seeded" suggestion
2010-09-14T16:02:20  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: we shouldn't increase uncertainty enough that that hurts too badly
2010-09-14T16:02:31  <jmcarthur> just enough to have some mobility
2010-09-14T16:02:46  <McLeopold> You mean, you don't want new bots to get scheduled a few more times?
2010-09-14T16:02:55  <McLeopold> oh, wait, now I see.
2010-09-14T16:03:02  <jmcarthur> it won't matter, is the point
2010-09-14T16:03:09  <jmcarthur> because they aren't starting over
2010-09-14T16:03:10  <McLeopold> New bots are different from, improved bots.
2010-09-14T16:03:13  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-14T16:03:28  <jmcarthur> absolutely new bots can take some time to rise in the ranks. i think that is perfectly fine
2010-09-14T16:03:42  <jmcarthur> probably more exciting anyway
2010-09-14T16:03:53  <McLeopold> No way, more frustrating for the bot owner.
2010-09-14T16:03:58  * jmcarthur shrugs
2010-09-14T16:04:03  <damag> I agree that's frustrating
2010-09-14T16:04:03  <jmcarthur> you can rise pretty quickly per game anyway
2010-09-14T16:04:12  <jmcarthur> if your bot is any good at all
2010-09-14T16:04:21  <jmcarthur> and the higher your uncertainty the fast you rise
2010-09-14T16:04:24  <jmcarthur> *faster
2010-09-14T16:04:26  <damag> Especially for people that uploaded the crappy default bots and let it play a bunch of games =)

2010-09-14T16:04:57  <jmcarthur> okay, we should probably increase uncertainty pretty drastically for resubmissions, but keep means where they were
2010-09-14T16:05:00  <damag> Maybe allow a user to clear their matches?
2010-09-14T16:05:06  <damag> When they choose to
2010-09-14T16:05:07  <McLeopold> You should have a list of the first 5 moves the default bot takes on each map, then schedule those less.
2010-09-14T16:05:14  <jmcarthur> damag: no need with uncertainty increase
2010-09-14T16:05:22  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: lol
2010-09-14T16:05:25  <damag> Ah ok
2010-09-14T16:05:36  <jmcarthur> there is some merit to wanting new bots to have more matches
2010-09-14T16:05:40  <jmcarthur> maybe need to think about it some more
2010-09-14T16:05:59  <McLeopold> Uncertainty could go all the way up with the same mean and you'd probably be okay.
2010-09-14T16:06:16  <McLeopold> But that means a new submission on an average bot gets to play the best bot.
2010-09-14T16:06:25  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@213.88.2.78> has quit IRC ()
2010-09-14T16:06:25  <jmcarthur> maybe "newness" could just be a factor multiplied by the time since it was last seeded
2010-09-14T16:06:42  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: no it doesn't
2010-09-14T16:06:49  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: it would play an average bot
2010-09-14T16:07:47  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: if the range is 0-50 and the bot's mean is 25 and uncertainty is huge, it will be matched with a bot that has a mean 25 and small uncertainty
2010-09-14T16:07:55  <McLeopold> ok
2010-09-14T16:08:02  <jmcarthur> ignore the range i quoted. unimportant
2010-09-14T16:08:31  <McLeopold> so a improved bad bot gets a chance to play an average bot on resubmission.
2010-09-14T16:08:34  <jmcarthur> *it will probably be matched wit
2010-09-14T16:08:36  <jmcarthur> h
2010-09-14T16:08:41  <jmcarthur> it's still probabilistic, we need to remember
2010-09-14T16:08:52  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: an improved bad bot will first play a bad bot
2010-09-14T16:09:08  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: but if it wins it has the mobility to move up after that since the uncertainty is big
2010-09-14T16:10:05  <jmcarthur> i suspect it would probably be best to just always reset uncertainty upon resubmission rather than just making it bigger
2010-09-14T16:10:11  <jmcarthur> that way it has maximal mobility
2010-09-14T16:10:18  <McLeopold> bot has range(2-4) mean(3), after resubmission has range(0-50) still mean of (3), so would play a 3

2010-09-14T16:10:37  <jmcarthur> yeah that's the case if we reset uncertainty completley
2010-09-14T16:10:53  <jmcarthur> in fact no matter what we do it will prefer to play a 3
2010-09-14T16:11:00  <jmcarthur> (not always. again, this is probability)
2010-09-14T16:11:02  <McLeopold> Then you can use uncertainty to help schedule resubmitted bots sooner.
2010-09-14T16:11:33  <jmcarthur> but that could starve bots that are around for a while. what if those developers are waiting for new matches for analysis?
2010-09-14T16:11:40  <jmcarthur> we need to be fair to all bots
2010-09-14T16:11:45  <dwchandler> next ai challenge: find smartest ranking algo ;-)
2010-09-14T16:11:59  <dwchandler> ranking/matching
2010-09-14T16:12:05  <McLeopold> That's why I like the 50/50 split of uncertainty/last seeded
2010-09-14T16:12:39  <danielvf> (what about a "request matches" button)
2010-09-14T16:12:55  <McLeopold> Yea, everyone wants to play deep blue.
2010-09-14T16:13:09  <McLeopold> You should have a deepblue only server.
2010-09-14T16:13:10  <xvinyl> dwchandler: actually that's a very real problem
2010-09-14T16:13:15  <jmcarthur> i think we should pick the bot with max(k*time_since_last_seed*some_factor_relating_to_newness_of_submission)
2010-09-14T16:13:17  <delt0r___> Isn't deep blue playing on tcp
2010-09-14T16:13:37  <jmcarthur> actually the k is probably unnecessary
2010-09-14T16:13:43  <jmcarthur> yeah, won't affect the max
2010-09-14T16:14:22  <jmcarthur> and maybe not *completely* reset uncertainty on resubmission. (maybe we should just run some simulations)
2010-09-14T16:14:32  <delt0r___> I honestly think its more a issue of having the hardware to simply play enough game per day. I mean I ran well over 1000 games in the last hour
2010-09-14T16:15:26  <delt0r___> Some 16 core monster should be able to churn through games pretty quickly.
2010-09-14T16:15:57  <dwchandler> here's a stupid idea: priority to winning bots to challenge up to higher ranked losing bots.
2010-09-14T16:16:23  <dwchandler> so winning bots get picked always, and losing bots get matched
2010-09-14T16:16:35  <jmcarthur> dwchandler: that would starve losing bots though
2010-09-14T16:16:49  <jmcarthur> i think we should try to give all bots as even rate of matches as possible
2010-09-14T16:16:50  <dwchandler> no, they get matched against
2010-09-14T16:16:55  <jmcarthur> people *will* complain otherwise
2010-09-14T16:17:10  <jmcarthur> also, if they only play top ranked bots, they will never get to tighten their confidence intervals
2010-09-14T16:17:17  <jmcarthur> nor will the top

2010-09-14T16:58:54  <hornairs> did anyone by change make a version of PlayGame with relaxed timeout requirements?
2010-09-14T16:59:37  <bss03> You specify the timeout on the PlayGame command-line.
2010-09-14T16:59:39  <ulope> tobiassjosten: seems normal. is "plague" your bot?
2010-09-14T17:00:05  <bss03> hornairs: The first "1000" means timeouts are 1000ms.  The second "1000" means games are 1000 turns long.

2010-09-14T17:08:46  <tobiassjosten> Say I want to use your repo as a submodule, for instance.
2010-09-14T17:09:43  <ulope> tobiassjosten: Either copy the planetwars dir into your pythons site-packages (not recommended) or (if you're on *nix / mac os) export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/the/dir/below/planetwars (still a bit ugly) or use virtualenv and put it into the virtualenv's site-packages (best option imho)
2010-09-14T17:10:15  <greghaynes> virtualenv ftw
2010-09-14T17:10:17  <tobiassjosten> Googling for virtualenv then. :) Thanks!

2010-09-14T18:45:36  <javagamer_Cpp> bss03, I see
2010-09-14T18:47:06  <bss03> It work in java because java uses references -- which are like pointers -- everywhere, so you don't need to know the size of your members to calculate the size of your class.
2010-09-14T18:48:35  <bss03> Various high-level languages use references or boxing or other techniques to allow "class A { B stuff; }; class B { A stuff; };" to "work".

2010-09-14T19:27:32  <Cyndre> wtf?
2010-09-14T19:27:45  <a1k0n> stacks of 1-unit fleets
2010-09-14T19:28:05  <sigh> haha

2010-09-14T19:28:15  <dstufft> lol
2010-09-14T19:28:19  <Cyndre> ahhh, was going to test another game and see if it was a visualizer bug
2010-09-14T19:28:25  <dstufft> that stack of 1 unit fleets are awesome
2010-09-14T19:28:33  <dstufft> you look at it and are like
2010-09-14T19:28:34  <dstufft> wtf??
2010-09-14T19:28:42  <a1k0n> good argument for combining fleets on the server
2010-09-14T19:28:44  <dstufft> though we should probably combine them transparently
2010-09-14T19:28:49  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-14T19:29:04  <sigh> in the server would be best, but at least in teh visualiser, if nothing else
2010-09-14T19:29:04  <ulope> Hm but whats the point? Confusing opponents who cant sum() ?
2010-09-14T19:29:05  <caytchen> i think this is done on tcp
2010-09-14T19:29:22  <a1k0n> compressing visualizations better?

2010-09-14T19:29:38  <Cyndre> how about any bot that iterates over the fleets badly
2010-09-14T19:30:04  <anoek> Are there any rules against shipping .so's and dlopen'ing them?
2010-09-14T19:30:06  <a1k0n> i don't even represent fleets as objects anymore

2010-09-14T19:30:47  <caytchen> what you do? sum up Incoming/Allied in the planet?
2010-09-14T19:30:48  <a1k0n> they're just future state changes of a planet

2010-09-14T19:31:39  <Accoun> if server dont combinre it
2010-09-14T19:32:12  <sigh> regardless, the visualiser should combine them

2010-09-14T19:33:00  <McLeopold> I believe the tcp server does combine them.

2010-09-14T19:33:22  <Zannick> there's a patch to do so for the contest server
2010-09-14T19:33:24  <a1k0n> well, we have evidence right there it doesn't

2010-09-14T20:08:42  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: so what if they had a majority of planets and nobody can overtake them? who's gonna win that?
2010-09-14T20:08:59  <bss03> My Old Bot vs. Dual vs. Rage vs. My New Bot, for example.
2010-09-14T20:09:08  <delt0r_> jmcarthur: I have not idea... I think they should go over to netrual...
2010-09-14T20:09:14  <delt0r_> earn nothing
2010-09-14T20:09:29  <delt0r_> but I don't recall seeing code to do that
2010-09-14T20:09:36  <delt0r_> mine doesn't
2010-09-14T20:09:49  <delt0r_> buts its untested on more than 2 players
2010-09-14T20:09:53  <bss03> I'll just implement it as 'error "Figure out what happens here."' in Haskell.
2010-09-14T20:10:03  <canihazbacon> you guys are talking about the improved python engine from the forums?

2010-09-14T20:12:59  <Accoun> news?
2010-09-14T20:13:03  <genericbob> delt0r_: It seems to set all their planets' owner to 0
2010-09-14T20:13:38  <Zannick> bss03: when you timeout or issue an invalid order, you are "kicked" from the game, which deletes all your fleets and makes your planets neutral
2010-09-14T20:14:05  <genericbob> I concur with Zannick
2010-09-14T20:14:32  <bss03> Zannick: Do your ships on planet stay and the planet is a populated Neutral, or are the ships deleted and the planet is a 0-pop Neutral?
2010-09-14T20:14:43  <Zannick> ships stay, only ownership changes
2010-09-14T20:15:42  <genericbob> Oddly enough the fleets become 0 ship neutral fleets with 1 turn remaining.
2010-09-14T20:16:30  <Zannick> yeah, i dislike that, but it works

2010-09-14T20:26:46  <eburnette> what maps are hardest to beat with the example bots? dualbot, perspector, rage
2010-09-14T20:27:07  <bss03> I've heard 26 and 30 are hard.
2010-09-14T20:27:17  <bss03> Dual and Rage are the only good ones I think.
2010-09-14T20:27:24  <genericbob> I concur with 30 being hard.

2010-09-14T20:27:41  <bss03> Prospector is pretty easy to beat because he only sends out one fleet at a time.

2010-09-14T20:29:23  <dstufft> i haz an idea
2010-09-14T20:30:40  <genericbob> bss03: one of my bots had a very hard time against RandomBot because of the one fleet at one time business. My bot was too defensive and wouldn't do hardly anything because RandomBot had a planet close to mine that had sent small fleets, thus ensuring that if I ordered an attack, RandomBot could attack and take over my planet.

2010-09-14T20:41:25  <mightybyte> Yeah, I got it.
2010-09-14T20:41:36  <mightybyte> Any new developments on the haskell support front?
2010-09-14T20:41:36  <Zannick> the game of galcon itself?
2010-09-14T20:41:43  <Zannick> :P

2010-09-14T20:41:55  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: still the same situation on the server, if that's what you mean
2010-09-14T20:42:00  <mightybyte> Yeah
2010-09-14T20:42:12  <mightybyte> And no support for binaries?
2010-09-14T20:42:15  <jmcarthur> not yet
2010-09-14T20:42:17  <Zannick> mightybyte: i don't think you would want to play a bot
2010-09-14T20:42:20  <jmcarthur> we need to make the sandbox better first
2010-09-14T20:42:24  <mightybyte> Zannick: I do.
2010-09-14T20:42:24  <Zannick> these games are hundreds of turns long
2010-09-14T20:42:32  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: when i was asking about supporting binaries before, i didn't realize how bad the sandbox was
2010-09-14T20:42:46  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Ahh
2010-09-14T20:42:53  <jmcarthur> honestly, i *still* think we might as well support binaries just because we are already supporing arbitrary code
2010-09-14T20:42:55  <Zannick> maybe if there were a better human-readable interface
2010-09-14T20:43:02  <jmcarthur> but it is scarier than i at first thought, either way
2010-09-14T20:43:20  <Zannick> i would not want to support binaries
2010-09-14T20:43:40  <jmcarthur> the only difference is we can't look at the source retroactively
2010-09-14T20:43:47  <mightybyte> If code is compiled in the forest and nobody is around to look at it, is it indistinguishable from a binary?
2010-09-14T20:43:49  <Zannick> no, there's also linked libraries
2010-09-14T20:44:06  <jmcarthur> i don't see the significance of that
2010-09-14T20:44:10  <Zannick> oh, but those can be included
2010-09-14T20:44:14  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-14T20:44:24  <jmcarthur> static binaries and all that
2010-09-14T20:44:28  <jmcarthur> anyway g2g
2010-09-14T20:44:36  <Zannick> oh
2010-09-14T20:44:39  <mightybyte> Ok, later.
2010-09-14T20:44:45  <Zannick> people would submit windows binaries and they wouldn't work
2010-09-14T20:45:25  <Zannick> by compiling it on the server, it's more likely that it'll run on the server
2010-09-14T20:45:30  <Zannick> i dunno
2010-09-14T20:45:34  <mightybyte> Yeah
2010-09-14T20:45:38  <Zannick> also the security issues are D:
2010-09-14T20:45:50  <Zannick> but they always are
2010-09-14T20:45:56  <mightybyte> The security issues are the same as with code.
2010-09-14T20:46:21  <mightybyte> ...with the exception of having the possibility to run static code analysis tools.
2010-09-14T20:47:06  <canihazbacon> what about using something like freebsd jails?
2010-09-14T20:47:35  <dstufft> the sandbox is one of the (many) issues we want to work on
2010-09-14T20:47:38  <Cyndre> Im still suggesting a client that connects to the main server that your bot runs in
2010-09-14T20:47:48  <dstufft> Cyndre: that's unfair
2010-09-14T20:47:50  <mightybyte> Heh, you could go with Trusted Solaris.
2010-09-14T20:47:53  <Cyndre> dstufft: how so?
2010-09-14T20:48:29  <mightybyte> Cyndre: I, with my big dual quad core server, will have an advantage over many people who don't have as much processing power at their fingertips.
2010-09-14T20:48:49  <dstufft> Cyndre: A) people with better computers will get an advantage (some one with a shitty computer get's less cpu time per 1s), B) People with high latency get penalized (they have to stop their turn before someone else does)
2010-09-14T20:49:15  <dstufft> C) If you live in a portion of the world your bandwidth is metered, it's asking you to pay to host your bot to compete
2010-09-14T20:49:17  <Cyndre> mightybyte: the client tracks your bot and kills it if it uses over x cpu time or x ram (create hard limits instead of 1 second of cpu time soft changing limits)
2010-09-14T20:49:30  <amstan> did someone ping me?
2010-09-14T20:49:37  <dstufft> and what's stopping someone from just using a different client
2010-09-14T20:49:46  <dstufft> it's not like our protocol is super hard
2010-09-14T20:49:54  <Cyndre> dstufft: nothing, but when it comes to finals your bot wont win and you will dq and the next person below you will replace you

2010-09-14T20:51:21  <amstan> it's just because of some dissagreements that jeff moved(his decision alone)
2010-09-14T20:51:32  <Zannick> er.
2010-09-14T20:51:37  <amstan> dstufft: and the disagreements mostly happened because of crappy fragile code
2010-09-14T20:52:43  <dstufft> amstan: i try to stay out of politics my life has less drama that way. I was just saying i talked to him earlier, and he seemed receptive to greghaynes offer
2010-09-14T20:52:50  <dstufft> but didn't say yes/no
2010-09-14T20:53:24  <amstan> i just don't like his miscommunication
2010-09-14T20:53:53  <amstan> and his mislabeling of things, it's neither a csclub event not google
2010-09-14T20:54:15  <Zannick> how did it end up being related to google?
2010-09-14T20:54:29  <amstan> Zannick: jeff worked at google
2010-09-14T20:54:51  <Zannick> and he ran one while at google?
2010-09-14T20:54:56  <Zannick> and then kept the name?
2010-09-14T20:55:14  <amstan> no
2010-09-14T20:55:28  <amstan> he just asked them if he can use the name for mutual advertisment
2010-09-14T20:55:41  <Zannick> ah
2010-09-14T20:55:52  <num1> that's how I found it, it has googles name
2010-09-14T20:56:10  <canihazbacon> so apart from the name google has no part in it?
2010-09-14T20:56:10  <Zannick> because with all of the server issues, many people have suggested google lend machines
2010-09-14T20:56:23  <Zannick> and that they aren't and will not
2010-09-14T20:56:47  <num1> too bad app engine doesn't allow persistent connections, could run a bot from there...
2010-09-14T20:57:04  <danielvf> It's much more impressive to win a "Google AI challenge", than a "Random AI challenge" good job on getting the name.
2010-09-14T20:57:15  <Zannick> yes, i agree
2010-09-14T20:57:33  <canihazbacon> danielvf: you definitely got a point there...
2010-09-14T20:57:43  <dwchandler> Random AI Challenge == a few dozen people
2010-09-14T20:57:46  <amstan> ideally i would like jeff to make peace with the club so we can move the contest back there
2010-09-14T20:58:03  <Zannick> i just dislike how unfortunate the whole thing has turned out, and being powerless to help even through i work for the "sponsor"
2010-09-14T20:58:04  <amstan> it can be just fine if it's waterloo ai challenge
2010-09-14T20:58:26  <amstan> Zannick: so like... he worked for one term as an intern there
2010-09-14T20:58:35  <amstan> anyway
2010-09-14T20:58:38  <amstan> that's not the issue
2010-09-14T20:58:52  <num1> wait a minute... If we patched the tcp server to allow connections over xmpp, we could run bots on Google App Engine!
2010-09-14T20:58:52  <Zannick> no, it's a separate complaint of mine :)
2010-09-14T20:58:59  <amstan> it would be very nice if we could just go back to uwaterloo, it's just much better there
2010-09-14T20:59:06  <Zannick> anyway, i must head out
2010-09-14T20:59:06  <dstufft> Zannick: get me a job imo
2010-09-14T20:59:08  <Caffeinated> Pfft.. So after all this I won't get a job working with google's AI machine to take over different websites based on popularity? =P
2010-09-14T20:59:09  <amstan> we have a server network, no bandwidth concerns

2010-09-14T21:05:36  <Cyndre> mightybyte: and it would allow you to run multiple bots without cheating others out of games (I assume thats why you can only have one)
2010-09-14T21:05:38  <mightybyte> Change to self-hosted bots via an interface program
2010-09-14T21:05:38  <dstufft> or do you mean the tcp server?
2010-09-14T21:05:42  <mightybyte> Yeah

2010-09-14T21:05:48  <dstufft> i don't see a point to it tbh
2010-09-14T21:05:48  <mightybyte> ...but not for the final contest.
2010-09-14T21:06:03  <dstufft> you can cheat it, and if you want to use that, there is already a tcp server set up
2010-09-14T21:06:12  <dstufft> what's the point in duplicating something that works

2010-09-14T21:06:28  <mightybyte> Yeah, but since it's not official, there aren't as many people playing there.
2010-09-14T21:06:29  <Cyndre> giving the ability to the other 400 that want to have more games
2010-09-14T21:06:50  <Cyndre> and if its a client it could be a live visualizer
2010-09-14T21:06:52  <dstufft> the way it's setup nwo, you can use tcp server to do testing of various bot types, and then upload to the official server to get a "tested on the final gaming platform"
2010-09-14T21:06:58  <mightybyte> Cyndre: Well, technically they all have the ability to play on the current tcp server.
2010-09-14T21:07:16  <Cyndre> mightybyte: if they come to irc, or read the forums
2010-09-14T21:07:34  <dstufft> and scheduling is being working on to get people to have more games
2010-09-14T21:07:35  <Cyndre> mihgtybyte: and use linux, and know how to compile it, and install gcc
2010-09-14T21:07:37  <mightybyte> Yeah.
2010-09-14T21:07:53  <Cyndre> see my point?
2010-09-14T21:08:03  <mightybyte> I see both points.
2010-09-14T21:08:04  <Cyndre> if the contest supported it we could have a very nice unofficial testing client

2010-09-14T21:08:41  <canihazbacon> There probably also is a rather large number of "drop-outs" that uploaded the startet package and lost interest...
2010-09-14T21:08:46  <Cyndre> and a few have already put significant work into this
2010-09-14T21:09:00  <Cyndre> which a visualizer and realtime results would have kept as well
2010-09-14T21:09:13  <mightybyte> Cyndre: And those who have put significant work into it will figure out ways to do adequate amounts of testing.
2010-09-14T21:10:01  <Cyndre> mightybyte: no, I meant into a visual client for tcp server
2010-09-14T21:10:50  <dstufft> we really should run a hash against the starter packs
2010-09-14T21:11:01  <dstufft> and exclude them from competing
2010-09-14T21:11:02  <dstufft> imo
2010-09-14T21:11:05  <mightybyte> dstufft: lol, I was just thinking about something similar.
2010-09-14T21:11:48  <mightybyte> Or maybe comparing their games to the starter pack bots and labelling them accordingly.
2010-09-14T21:12:14  <dstufft> that is signicantly harder
2010-09-14T21:12:37  <Cyndre> my bot is going to get smarter soon - my two biggest pit falls is planet selection which I am almost done fixing, and sending to many reinforcements to a planet which shouldnt be hard to fix
2010-09-14T21:12:38  <dstufft> hueristics on how a bot plays i wouldn't want to write it lol
2010-09-14T21:12:59  <dstufft> hashing (or a diff I suppose, but meh id just hash)

2010-09-14T21:15:09  <other_donkey> I think the idea is just to stop people spamming the default bots

2010-09-14T21:15:23  * Cyndre cheers dstufft on
2010-09-14T21:15:28  <dstufft> the quick start guide encourages people to upload the default bot
2010-09-14T21:15:31  <Caffeinated> If they're lazy enough to upload the defaults.....

2010-09-14T21:15:43  <dstufft> so im sure there is atleast some people whose accounts are nothing but the default bots
2010-09-14T21:16:00  <dstufft> I mean we could add "official" accouts for each of the example bots
2010-09-14T21:16:04  <sigh> Caffeinated: Uploading the default is an explict step in the tutorial
2010-09-14T21:16:10  <dstufft> and exlude them from the hash checks
2010-09-14T21:16:21  <sigh> so not necessarily lazy
2010-09-14T21:16:22  <dstufft> if people want to compete against RageBot etc in the tournament
2010-09-14T21:16:24  <Naktibalda> dstufft: can you find accounts with single submition?
2010-09-14T21:16:32  <dstufft> Naktibalda: we can yes
2010-09-14T21:16:38  <other_donkey> update the tutorial to have the user make a small change in the logic before they upload
2010-09-14T21:16:53  <Naktibalda> many of them should be starter packs
2010-09-14T21:17:15  <dwchandler> other_donkey: that's already in the tutorial
2010-09-14T21:17:18  <dstufft> Naktibalda: probably, but some of them arnt so doing it like that would suck
2010-09-14T21:17:20  <Naktibalda> probably should be worth to check manually
2010-09-14T21:17:35  <dstufft> could easily add it in to compile_anything.py
2010-09-14T21:17:47  <dstufft> to update it's status to Default Bot
2010-09-14T21:17:47  <Cyndre> make them fix an error in the starter pack
2010-09-14T21:18:04  <dstufft> i think the purpose of that step is to give you a sense of accomplishment

2010-09-14T21:34:45  <jmcarthur> reading up a see that you complained that it isn't supported on windows and stuff like that, but really, these tools were made by people not directly involved, and others could port it and tweak it and whatever else all they want if they'd just get off their asses and do it
2010-09-14T21:34:48  <Cyndre> for you guys yes - but your not the target

2010-09-14T21:35:47  <jmcarthur> or you could just run linux. it's easy. you don't even have to kill your windows install

2010-09-14T21:46:47  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i think tryhaskell.org is an awesome example of a web site for noobs. you get a live console, interactive tutorial, and are even prompted to join #haskell via a web interface after you have gone through the first couple steps
2010-09-14T21:47:00  <Cyndre> are you serious?
2010-09-14T21:47:02  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-14T21:47:14  <Cyndre> do the people in #haskell appreciate that?
2010-09-14T21:47:21  <jmcarthur> oh yeah. #haskell loves noobs
2010-09-14T21:47:34  <jmcarthur> #haskell is overwhelmingly helpful at times
2010-09-14T21:47:41  <melkor> #haskell appreciates all the help it can get, have you tried it lately.
2010-09-14T21:48:58  <Cyndre> I think thats great :)
2010-09-14T21:49:28  <Cyndre> probably one of the wierdest things they have seen all day

2010-09-14T21:49:57  <jmcarthur> nah, we get the occasional troll that says even weirder things
2010-09-14T21:51:10  <Cyndre> I hate trolls - I never understand them, people confuse me with them sometimes, and I am oblvious and normally last to catch on to being trolled
2010-09-14T21:51:29  <jmcarthur> we have a fun strategy for handling trolls in #haskell
2010-09-14T21:51:43  <Cyndre> ?
2010-09-14T21:52:45  <jmcarthur> we wave our banhammer stick and say they need to be nice if they want to stay and, usually, because they want to stick around long enough to keep trolling as all trolls do, they quiet down a little and start learning haskell just so they can earn their right to stay. sometimes we have to talk them to death, but it works amazingly well

2010-09-14T21:57:46  <ajhager> oops
2010-09-14T21:58:13  <eburnette> I mean I'm trying to figure out why my bot stopped and I was wondering if lots of fleets could be the culprit. Local run.
2010-09-14T21:58:16  <ajhager> But it should be usable now.
2010-09-14T21:58:29  <tapwater> I enjoy reading different haskell implementations of the same problem
2010-09-14T21:58:57  <tapwater> you can almost say haskell is too expressive haha
2010-09-14T21:59:40  <jmcarthur> i'm writing mine into the spec as literate haskell, which means i'm reimplementing a lot of the engine too
2010-09-14T21:59:55  <jmcarthur> kind of ugly at the moment
2010-09-14T22:00:05  <whiteside> eburnette: are you sure you're not sending more ships than you have? I was accidentally doing that.
2010-09-14T22:00:57  <eburnette> possible I guess, I'll check for that too
2010-09-14T22:01:06  <drg> If you run PlayGame.jar without piping it into ShowGame.jar, it should give you a reason your bot stopped in the log file you specify.

2010-09-14T22:05:38  <dstufft> I don't know what the requirements are, but i can't imagine they are much, since the tcp server runs the bots locally
2010-09-14T22:05:42  <dstufft> and not on the end server
2010-09-14T22:05:56  <amstan> for the tcp server you don't need something very strong
2010-09-14T22:06:06  <amstan> though.. what's a linode?
2010-09-14T22:06:11  <dstufft> its a company
2010-09-14T22:06:12  <rogue780> amstan, im going to host a tcp server
2010-09-14T22:06:14  <rogue780> linode.com
2010-09-14T22:06:16  <dstufft> they offer vps slices
2010-09-14T22:06:23  <amstan> purchasing and server with 768 mb of ram does not sound like a good idea
2010-09-14T22:06:23  <rogue780> they provide vps...yeah waht dstufft said
2010-09-14T22:06:23  <dstufft> decently cheap, i used to use them
2010-09-14T22:06:27  <dstufft> its a VPS
2010-09-14T22:06:29  <amstan> aha
2010-09-14T22:06:44  <dstufft> you pay like (idk what the 768 ones cost, 40 bucks or so?)
2010-09-14T22:06:47  <amstan> rogue780: i usually prefer to run my own servers, have them at home
2010-09-14T22:06:48  <dstufft> a month
2010-09-14T22:06:51  <danielvf> rogue780: neads hardly any ram
2010-09-14T22:06:59  <amstan> example: hypertriangle
2010-09-14T22:07:00  <rogue780> $19.95/mo for 512mb ram, $29.99/mo for 768
2010-09-14T22:07:07  <dstufft> rogue780: you could probably get away with the cheapest linode
2010-09-14T22:07:11  <rogue780> ok. i'll go with the cheap one then
2010-09-14T22:07:14  <amstan> rogue780: seems like a lot, what nets does it have?
2010-09-14T22:07:22  <dstufft> all tcp server really does is act like a go between

2010-09-14T22:09:01  <rogue780> my home server is less stable because I have comcast
2010-09-14T22:09:20  <dstufft> also a lot of residental net specifically disallow hosting servers

2010-09-14T22:10:08  <rogue780> running this tcp server can't take more power than running an urbanterror server did
2010-09-14T22:10:18  <Cyndre> I could run this on my home server to if you guys want a server up and running
2010-09-14T22:10:19  <rogue780> heck, lemme host it here and see how well that works
2010-09-14T22:10:20  <dstufft> amstan: vps's are very little headache, you don't have to deal with the hardware issues at all
2010-09-14T22:10:31  <dstufft> same with dedicated
2010-09-14T22:10:40  <dstufft> the hardware isn't your problem
2010-09-14T22:10:42  <amstan> dstufft: but you deal with tons of software issues, sometimes you can't even touch the insall

2010-09-14T22:11:08  <dstufft> linode you get complete control
2010-09-14T22:11:28  <dstufft> you can even install whole new OS's, (as long as it's linux and can use their kernel)
2010-09-14T22:11:33  <dstufft> RapidKVM you can install any OS
2010-09-14T22:12:05  <dstufft> managed is a completly different story
2010-09-14T22:12:18  <dstufft> they run the server for you, so of course they don't want you in there screwing around

2010-09-14T22:29:58  <RobotCaleb> if your app is only using 50% of the CPU it will take 2 wall clock seconds to hit 1 second of CPU time

2010-09-14T22:31:09  <RobotCaleb> no, they'll just check the system clock for when you start and make sure you give an order before 1 second has passed
2010-09-14T22:31:12  <McLeopold> oh... how would my bot calculate that?
2010-09-14T22:31:18  <RobotCaleb> same way
2010-09-14T22:31:42  <dstufft> McLeopold: wall clock is real time
2010-09-14T22:31:46  <genericbob> RobotCaleb: it also works the other way, if your bot is multi threaded (and there is more then one processor) it might take up 2sec of CPU time for every 1sec of wall time.
2010-09-14T22:31:48  <dstufft> like, 1 second in the real world
2010-09-14T22:31:56  <RobotCaleb> cache the current time when you get the order
2010-09-14T22:32:05  <dstufft> there are issues either way
2010-09-14T22:32:17  <RobotCaleb> genericbob: I thought I read no threading?
2010-09-14T22:32:26  <dstufft> if you use wall time, then if the server is under a lot of load, you might get less cpu time per second of wall time
2010-09-14T22:32:53  <dstufft> if you use cpu time, people can do while: sleep(999) and it punishes less effecient languages
2010-09-14T22:32:56  <DirtyKeyboard> is TCP down? D:
2010-09-14T22:32:58  <RobotCaleb> They basically chose wall time because they said they can't accurately measure cpu time for the process.

2010-09-14T22:57:40  <jmcarthur> kind of cheesy to look back on, but i watched it religiously at one time

2010-09-14T23:30:40  *** unhelpful_advice is now known as rogue780
2010-09-14T23:30:47  <sigh> it didn't run for me on java 1.5
2010-09-14T23:30:57  <drg> open java preferences, drag Java SE 6 to top of both lists
2010-09-14T23:30:58  <rogue780> lemme see...i'm gonna turn it off and on again...
2010-09-14T23:31:47  <adi_> Thanks drg, trying it out
2010-09-14T23:32:21  <rogue780> RobotCaleb, sweet
2010-09-14T23:34:29  <rogue780> alrighty...just finishing up ubuntu install, then I'll get to work on compiling the server
2010-09-14T23:35:20  <adi_> drg, that works great! :)
2010-09-14T23:35:22  <adi_> Thanks again
2010-09-14T23:35:27  <drg> No problem!

2010-09-14T23:43:49  <RobotCaleb> I think that's a fair assumption
2010-09-14T23:44:07  <genericbob> I just created some 3-player and 4-player maps

2010-09-14T23:45:10  <rogue780|server> is this thing supposed to serve the games and the web site as well?
2010-09-14T23:45:17  <rogue780|server> I'm so confused as to how this all works right now
2010-09-14T23:45:31  <RobotCaleb> I haven't a clue. I never even opened it
2010-09-14T23:45:32  <RobotCaleb> :)
2010-09-14T23:46:26  <rogue780|server> crap. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do this :\
2010-09-14T23:46:37  <rogue780|server> did someone say greghaynes was working on it too?
2010-09-14T23:46:56  <genericbob> I'm also going to create some mirrored maps. (ie. if there is a planet at x,y there will be another planet at x,-y instead of -x,-y)
2010-09-14T23:47:49  <bss03-AFK> genericbob: I was thinking of writing something that would take a 2-player map and turn it into an n-player map.
2010-09-14T23:47:59  <rogue780|server> danielvf, this server code is yours, right?
2010-09-14T23:48:48  <RobotCaleb> rogue780: What's the issue?
2010-09-14T23:48:56  <bss03-AFK> genericbob: Just map all objects with phase x in (0, pi] to (0, pi * 2 / n] and repeat them.
2010-09-14T23:49:10  <bss03-AFK> genericbob: Then, I would instantly have 100 n-player maps. :)
2010-09-14T23:49:16  <rogue780|server> Dammit, Jim, I'm a PHP developer, not a C server compiler guy!
2010-09-14T23:49:40  <genericbob> bss03-AFK: That's what I do, I modified the map_generator.py to do that
2010-09-14T23:49:55  <rogue780|server> bss03-AFK, I believe your handle is a misnomer
2010-09-14T23:50:07  *** bss03-AFK is now known as bss03
2010-09-14T23:50:08  <other_donkey> rogue780|server: greghaynes *might* be working on getting his server on
2010-09-14T23:50:19  <bss03> rogue780: Oops, I always forget to take that off.
2010-09-14T23:50:30  <RobotCaleb> rogue780: Looks like there's no database, just raw files it writes to and reads from
2010-09-14T23:50:49  <dwchandler> I think I've got a tcp server up at ./tcp 140.99.51.114 9999 ...
2010-09-14T23:51:23  <dwchandler> no web site, just the tcp server
2010-09-14T23:51:37  <bss03> Is benxe not coming back? :(
2010-09-14T23:51:38  <genericbob> It would be cool to have a tcp server with 3 or 4 players possible.
2010-09-14T23:51:55  <RobotCaleb> Is there an engine that does n players?

2010-09-14T23:52:31  <RobotCaleb> cool
2010-09-14T23:52:39  <dwchandler> deepblue: I just put one up at 140.99.51.114
2010-09-14T23:52:46  <deepblue> oh
2010-09-14T23:52:46  <bss03> RobotCaleb: I'm also writing one in Haskell as part of my bot.
2010-09-14T23:52:48  <rogue780> dwchandler, dwchandler sweet. that's awesome
2010-09-14T23:52:48  <dwchandler> anyone want to try and see if it's working?
2010-09-14T23:52:51  <deepblue> awesomesauce
2010-09-14T23:52:57  <rogue780> dwchandler, it works for me
2010-09-14T23:53:05  <rogue780> are you going to try and get the website part working too?
2010-09-14T23:53:07  <dwchandler> cool! thanks, rogue780
2010-09-14T23:53:19  <deepblue> port 9999?
2010-09-14T23:53:21  <rogue780> I lost against your bot though...although it's my really crappy bot

2010-09-14T23:53:37  <deepblue> -_-
2010-09-14T23:53:44  <dwchandler> hey now, let's not get too friendly
2010-09-14T23:53:49  <rogue780> they don't call you DEEPblue, for nothing
2010-09-14T23:54:13  <genericbob> Opponent disconnected
2010-09-14T23:54:14  <genericbob> You WIN against ErrBot_0.0.5
2010-09-14T23:54:19  <deepblue> hehe
2010-09-14T23:54:22  <rogue780> yeah, I just hit ctrl+c
2010-09-14T23:54:43  <dwchandler> I will see if I can reverse engineer a web site without too much trouble
2010-09-14T23:54:54  <rogue780> ErrBot_0.0.5 is a failbot. 0.0.5b should be a marked improvement
2010-09-14T23:54:54  <dwchandler> but it's getting late for me
2010-09-14T23:54:56  <RobotCaleb> dwchandler: What's wrong with the site provided?
2010-09-14T23:54:57  <McLeopold> dwchandler: how did you compile?  does your getplayer.cpp have a reference to stdlib.h?
2010-09-14T23:55:03  <bss03> I'm connected to the new tcp server.  I've got a shell loop connecting 5 secs. after each game.
2010-09-14T23:55:06  <rogue780> dwchandler, I believe most of the front-end for it is on github
2010-09-14T23:55:21  <bss03> So, If you need data, you can play my crappy bot, while I work on making it awesome again.
2010-09-14T23:55:51  <dwchandler> McLeopold: there's a fair chance daniel wrote this on openbsd, which is what I compiled on
2010-09-14T23:56:03  <RobotCaleb> dwchandler: There's site code in htdocs folder in the archive, right?
2010-09-14T23:56:10  <dwchandler> so I just typed 'make'
2010-09-14T23:56:39  <McLeopold> crap, I'm on gentoo and it doesn't compile
2010-09-14T23:56:55  <rogue780|server> " I'm on gentoo" <------ problem found
2010-09-14T23:57:16  <bss03> rogue780: Ppft.
2010-09-14T23:57:19  <McLeopold> har har, gentoo is suppose to compile EVERYTHING
2010-09-14T23:57:19  <rogue780|server> ;)
2010-09-14T23:57:48  <dwchandler> ah, yes, htdocs looks like it has all the goodies :)
2010-09-14T23:57:54  <bss03> I abandoned Gentoo years ago, as I was spending too much time maintaining it and not enough time using it.
2010-09-14T23:58:06  <rogue780|server> McLeopold, of course it is. To install it, it has to compile itself, after you write and assembler by manually flipping bits on the hard drive with a neodinium magnet
2010-09-14T23:58:16  <bss03> But, It's still not always the clusterfsck that everyone claims it is.
2010-09-14T23:58:30  <rogue780|server> when I type make it complains about not having tcp.c
2010-09-14T23:58:33  <deepblue> i used gentoo for a long time
2010-09-14T23:58:34  <other_donkey> dwchandler: works and is rather fast
2010-09-14T23:58:44  <deepblue> then I was forced to use macosx
2010-09-14T23:58:56  <rogue780|server> can someone link me to tcp.c?
