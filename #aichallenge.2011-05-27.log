2011-05-27T01:10:17  <McLeopold> amstan: what needs attention?
2011-05-27T01:10:31  <amstan> McLeopold: do you like it brown? http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/
2011-05-27T01:11:06  <amstan> McLeopold: also, what's the significance of the faded out lines in the rankings?
2011-05-27T01:11:06  <McLeopold> yes
2011-05-27T01:11:21  <McLeopold> high water marks for old submissions
2011-05-27T01:11:33  <McLeopold> thus the "ghost" emoticon
2011-05-27T01:11:37  <amstan> what's the criteria for that?
2011-05-27T01:12:01  <McLeopold> It's so that when you submit a new bot, and it starts at zero, other don't wonder where you've gone
2011-05-27T01:12:33  <amstan> yes, but for how long does it stay for example?
2011-05-27T01:12:40  <amstan> what's the algorithm for showing a ghost?
2011-05-27T01:12:59  <McLeopold> you always get 2 spots on the list, highest from last leaderboard and latest
2011-05-27T01:13:16  <McLeopold> if latest is the highest, you only see one
2011-05-27T01:13:46  <McLeopold> I'd  like to add something more to remove them if you never regain you skill level, but I'll worry about that later.
2011-05-27T01:13:48  <amstan> there might be a lot of shadows showing in the end
2011-05-27T01:13:58  <amstan> for 700 ppl
2011-05-27T01:14:09  <amstan> maybe only display it for top 100
2011-05-27T01:14:30  <amstan> Frontier: ping
2011-05-27T01:14:34  <McLeopold> I want to wait a bit to see how it affects us before I decide how it will work
2011-05-27T01:14:39  <amstan> ok
2011-05-27T01:14:44  <Frontier>  amstan: pong
2011-05-27T01:15:00  <amstan> Frontier: clicking on game is broken in your front page visualizer
2011-05-27T01:15:00  <McLeopold> Also, I might have to add a "don't show old submissions" option
2011-05-27T01:15:07  <amstan> yields this: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game_id=2860
2011-05-27T01:15:21  <Frontier> redirect to McLeopold :p
2011-05-27T01:15:42  <amstan> Frontier: i would have fixed it myself, but couldn't find the code
2011-05-27T01:15:51  <McLeopold> amstan: that's my check
2011-05-27T01:16:12  <McLeopold> it was the xss fix
2011-05-27T01:16:21  <amstan> McLeopold: hmm?
2011-05-27T01:16:32  <amstan> McLeopold: i don't get it... right now it seems that the get variable name is wrong
2011-05-27T01:16:32  <McLeopold> wait, it shouldn't be game_id, it should be game
2011-05-27T01:16:37  <amstan> s/game_id/game/
2011-05-27T01:16:40  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-27T01:16:53  <McLeopold> I think that's in the json :(
2011-05-27T01:17:04  <amstan> sed should fix that
2011-05-27T01:17:16  <McLeopold> wait until I fix api_game_result
2011-05-27T01:18:23  <amstan> McLeopold: question: did you make the ant.ico from the svg file? computerwiz was asking
2011-05-27T01:18:44  <McLeopold> I made it from an svg file I found on the internet somewhere
2011-05-27T01:18:58  <amstan> we have an svg file of an ant
2011-05-27T01:19:00  <McLeopold> It should probably be redone
2011-05-27T01:19:01  <amstan> the ones from the header
2011-05-27T01:19:44  <McLeopold> I was just stopping favicon http errors, so I took the one from my ants paste site

2011-05-27T01:24:59  <amstan> it should have been like a week
2011-05-27T01:24:59  <McLeopold> no, it's running
2011-05-27T01:25:05  <amstan> it's only 2 days
2011-05-27T01:25:07  <amstan> idk why
2011-05-27T01:25:14  <McLeopold> how do you calc that?
2011-05-27T01:25:21  <amstan> exec("uptime")
2011-05-27T01:25:41  <McLeopold> that doesn't really explain it
2011-05-27T01:25:50  <amstan> calculate what?
2011-05-27T01:26:01  <McLeopold> where is this server?
2011-05-27T01:26:19  <amstan> idk, it's a hosted thing from sshvm
2011-05-27T01:26:43  <McLeopold> it's tomorrow at 9:25 where ever it is

2011-05-27T01:27:17  * amstan is so confused
2011-05-27T01:27:25  <amstan> how can an uptime be tomorrow?
2011-05-27T01:27:33  <McLeopold> oh, server uptime, I was thinking a process uptime
2011-05-27T01:27:40  <amstan> yes
2011-05-27T01:27:53  <amstan> by manager i mean that, as in... the central server where the website is
2011-05-27T01:28:01  <McLeopold> separate issue, I was looking at the log's time stamp and getting confused
2011-05-27T01:29:35  <McLeopold> amstan: can you do your sed magic on the replay files?
2011-05-27T01:29:45  <amstan> McLeopold: stop the worker
2011-05-27T01:30:01  <McLeopold> stopped
2011-05-27T01:30:52  <McLeopold> that last game is really interesting
2011-05-27T01:31:11  <amstan> is that a bad idea: contest@aichallengebeta:~$ cp -r games/ /tmp
2011-05-27T01:31:28  <McLeopold> do a du first?
2011-05-27T01:31:35  <amstan> oh dear, 410M
2011-05-27T01:31:44  <amstan> for 2861
2011-05-27T01:31:46  <amstan> games
2011-05-27T01:31:54  <amstan> i don't like this
2011-05-27T01:31:57  <amstan> we should compress them
2011-05-27T01:32:11  <amstan> or at least the old ones
2011-05-27T01:32:14  <McLeopold> we should get that coordinated with apache as well
2011-05-27T01:32:19  <amstan> yes
2011-05-27T01:32:36  <amstan> though..
2011-05-27T01:32:51  <amstan> i'm pretty sure there's fuse file systems that do live compressions
2011-05-27T01:33:01  <McLeopold> http://serverfault.com/questions/246738/making-apache-serve-unzipped-content-from-zipped-files
2011-05-27T01:33:02  <amstan> so it might be easier to do that
2011-05-27T01:33:04  <amstan> and transparent
2011-05-27T01:33:26  <amstan> McLeopold: it would be nice if apache could also send the data compressed, and the uncompressed by the browser
2011-05-27T01:33:30  <amstan> you know.. save some bandwidth
2011-05-27T01:33:50  <McLeopold> I think that's what the suggestion in the link does?
2011-05-27T01:34:54  <amstan> where?
2011-05-27T01:35:11  <McLeopold> did you not see my url?
2011-05-27T01:35:19  <McLeopold> up 8 lines
2011-05-27T01:36:21  <amstan> yeah, i did
2011-05-27T01:36:33  <amstan> but it mostly talks about decompressing before sending
2011-05-27T01:36:42  <amstan> i would like it to stay compressed till it gets to the browser
2011-05-27T01:37:03  <McLeopold> me too
2011-05-27T01:37:37  <amstan> i'm just thinking we should use a fuse compress fs thingy
2011-05-27T01:37:42  <amstan> that way it's all transparent
2011-05-27T01:38:01  <amstan> and then set up apache to compress everything before sending as well(if we need bw)
2011-05-27T01:38:01  <McLeopold> okay, then can you do that?
2011-05-27T01:38:25  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, i could
2011-05-27T01:38:39  <McLeopold> so, then it would uncompress and recompress before going to the browser?
2011-05-27T01:38:54  <amstan> pretty much
2011-05-27T01:39:06  <amstan> but i was just thinking if it's worth using the cpu on the manager to save bandwidth

2011-05-27T01:42:52  <McLeopold> can I start the worker again?
2011-05-27T01:42:59  <amstan> no, just a sec
2011-05-27T01:43:02  <amstan> i got sidetracked
2011-05-27T01:43:52  <McLeopold> hmm, what if the client doesn't accept gzip?
2011-05-27T01:43:53  <amstan> oh man... a simple copy on these files is taking ages
2011-05-27T01:44:06  <amstan> McLeopold: apache will detect, and hopefully unpack for him
2011-05-27T01:44:13  <amstan> it does when it compresses on the fly
2011-05-27T01:44:19  <McLeopold> k
2011-05-27T01:44:30  <amstan> and by hopefully i mean i have no idea, and probably not
2011-05-27T01:45:22  <McLeopold> how much space will we have on the official server?
2011-05-27T01:45:57  <amstan> we should stay within 100GB

2011-05-27T01:58:47  <McLeopold> did you test some older games?

2011-05-27T01:59:33  <amstan> there's an entry for it
2011-05-27T01:59:40  <amstan> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/game/0
2011-05-27T01:59:44  <McLeopold> really?
2011-05-27T01:59:55  <amstan> it says incorrect game number
2011-05-27T02:00:02  <amstan> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=0
2011-05-27T02:00:08  <McLeopold> 0 is falsy
2011-05-27T02:00:13  <_flag> I think it checks to see if the game id is "true" and zero is "false"

2011-05-27T02:04:10  <McLeopold> the json doesn't have the name data in it
2011-05-27T02:04:11  <amstan> i can't click the game id either
2011-05-27T02:04:21  <amstan> maybe that was a test or something
2011-05-27T02:04:29  <Frontier> I check for game_id on the url, not for game

2011-05-27T02:11:35  <Frontier> yes
2011-05-27T02:11:46  <Frontier> Please take a look at: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/game/2870
2011-05-27T02:11:52  <Frontier> It is truncated!
2011-05-27T02:12:08  <amstan> it ends with "date":"2011-05-27T10:09:30+04:00","game_id":2870} for me
2011-05-27T02:12:15  <Frontier> not for me
2011-05-27T02:12:21  <amstan> refresh maybe?
2011-05-27T02:12:43  <Frontier> now it is written completely
2011-05-27T02:13:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: yes, less professional, more personality
2011-05-27T02:13:14  <Frontier> so... don't show games on the front page that haven't been written to disk yet *g*
2011-05-27T02:13:25  <amstan> Frontier: that was my bad: permissions
2011-05-27T02:13:31  <McLeopold> the memcache key isn't set unti lthe write is complete
2011-05-27T02:14:56  <antimatroid1> with the current one, i wouldn't bold or increase the font size of "sign up", i'd get rid of that little triangle thing, possibly even fade the top green from dark to light, possibly converging on the right hand side green shade, and I don't think the font for "Google AI Challenge" wroks
2011-05-27T02:15:29  <antimatroid1> or maybe it's the shading around it, it just doesn't look "very good" to me :\
2011-05-27T02:15:47  <McLeopold> yeah, the shading doesn't look good
2011-05-27T02:16:11  <McLeopold> I wanted the "sign up" to be big for only those that haven't logged in at all
2011-05-27T02:16:26  <McLeopold> so it draw attention
2011-05-27T02:16:35  <McLeopold> but it can go if it looks bad
2011-05-27T02:17:00  <McLeopold> The whole header needs to be shrunk in size, it takes too much space
2011-05-27T02:17:12  <antimatroid1> would it work to just stick a big sign up button on the main page where people will first look?
2011-05-27T02:17:19  <antimatroid1> where the description of the game is
2011-05-27T02:17:25  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-27T02:17:50  <antimatroid1> i'd maybe even move sign up/in /logout to above the overview part
2011-05-27T02:17:53  <amstan> it's only about 10px bigger than the previous design
2011-05-27T02:17:57  <McLeopold> actually, it should be above the word "Overview"
2011-05-27T02:18:02  <antimatroid1> add the profile link there and maybe even title it "user management" or something
2011-05-27T02:19:45  <antimatroid1> i would love to see a go at making the background a scaled up version of one of the maps
2011-05-27T02:20:15  <antimatroid1> and some beta games where there's not so much food :)
2011-05-27T02:20:16  <antimatroid1> :P
2011-05-27T02:20:55  <_flag> What was the rational for needing a redesign anyway?

2011-05-27T02:22:23  <McLeopold> yes
2011-05-27T02:22:25  <amstan> ok
2011-05-27T02:22:28  <McLeopold> :)
2011-05-27T02:22:31  <amstan> it was contest: before
2011-05-27T02:22:36  <amstan> and it made it fail
2011-05-27T02:22:49  <McLeopold> but group has read/write
2011-05-27T02:22:50  <amstan> done
2011-05-27T02:23:09  <amstan> not for the folders inside..
2011-05-27T02:23:24  <McLeopold> it should
2011-05-27T02:23:32  <amstan> when they get created by the www-data process they get set to www-data:www-data at 755
2011-05-27T02:23:41  <McLeopold> I hit this issue before and though I got past it
2011-05-27T02:24:13  <amstan> pretty much, when you make new files, you have to remmeber that it won't inheret the permissions of the parent folder
2011-05-27T02:24:29  <McLeopold> line 86 of api_game_result says 775
2011-05-27T02:24:29  <amstan> it'll just do currentuser:currentuser 755
2011-05-27T02:24:39  <amstan> drwxr-xr-x 2 contest www-data  36K 2011-05-27 09:47 0
2011-05-27T02:24:45  <amstan> tell that to ls
2011-05-27T02:24:46  <amstan> lol
2011-05-27T02:25:36  <McLeopold> hmm, maybe the web server creates it as www-data:www-data?
2011-05-27T02:25:47  <amstan> it does, it has no choice
2011-05-27T02:25:53  <amstan> unless it has sudo
2011-05-27T02:25:58  <McLeopold> can't I force the owner at the os level?
2011-05-27T02:26:02  <amstan> nope
2011-05-27T02:26:13  <McLeopold> I'm thinking of samba then
2011-05-27T02:26:17  <amstan> setfacl does it
2011-05-27T02:26:39  <McLeopold> well, contest is only needed for administration
2011-05-27T02:27:01  <McLeopold> so, it's not that big a deal
2011-05-27T02:27:15  <amstan> unix doesn't allow users to chown stuff themselves, since the quotas and other things are based on file owners

2011-05-27T02:31:45  <amstan> \o/
2011-05-27T02:32:01  <McLeopold> I guess I don't understand apache gzip
2011-05-27T02:37:16  * amstan goes to sleep
2011-05-27T02:40:03  <McLeopold> Frontier: can javascript request gzip encoding?
2011-05-27T02:40:58  <Frontier> I should be able to set the header to anything.
2011-05-27T02:41:10  <Frontier> What is it requested as right now?
2011-05-27T02:41:15  <McLeopold> check out that link above
2011-05-27T02:43:27  <Frontier> Chrome sets the header to: Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate,sdch
2011-05-27T02:43:36  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-27T02:45:04  <Frontier> Opera has gzip and deflate set. I assume other browsers do it the same way. And look what the response is: Content-Location: 7.replay.gz
2011-05-27T02:47:24  <Frontier> hmm looks like Chrome doesn't get gzip encoded data from the server, but Opera does.
2011-05-27T02:49:23  <Frontier> Firefox responds with a 404
2011-05-27T02:50:21  <Frontier> ah now it works, but it doesn't unpack the gzip content.
2011-05-27T02:50:32  <Frontier> so I have garbage in the visualize
2011-05-27T02:50:56  <McLeopold> only opera works
2011-05-27T02:51:08  <Frontier> that's right
2011-05-27T02:51:17  <McLeopold> do I need to set another header for the browser to unpack?
2011-05-27T02:51:33  <Frontier> I don't know really. HTTP headers is not my domain.
2011-05-27T02:52:19  <Frontier> You could try some other website that serves content gzip encoded and compare the headers
2011-05-27T02:53:08  <McLeopold> I don't see the Content-encoding header...
2011-05-27T02:53:16  <Frontier> But in the end it depends on the XmlHttpRequest implementation in the browser if it works the same as a normal request
2011-05-27T02:53:49  <Frontier> Content-Encoding: gzip is what Firebug reports
2011-05-27T02:54:28  <Frontier> I could check Safari, but I think 3 different behaviours is enough for now

2011-05-27T04:19:39  <McLeopold> probably the gzip thing?

2011-05-27T04:44:18  <Frontier> McLeopold: browse the channel logs. I posted a lot of info on the virtual memory on the test server and the impact on virtual machines.
2011-05-27T04:44:37  <Frontier> look for OpenVZ
2011-05-27T04:44:49  <McLeopold> what's the TL;DR
2011-05-27T04:45:32  <Frontier> aichallenge.2011-05-22.log is the file,what dies TL;DR mean?
2011-05-27T04:45:53  <McLeopold> too long, didn't read
2011-05-27T04:45:57  <McLeopold> what's the summary?
2011-05-27T04:46:33  <Frontier> uh... how to explain. it only has 1 GB of memory
2011-05-27T04:46:47  <Frontier> this is virtual memory
2011-05-27T04:47:22  <Frontier> a default java process uses 1gig of virtual memory on my computer, but actually only uses a few mb of it.
2011-05-27T04:47:37  <McLeopold> Frontier: look how long you last :) http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=2922
2011-05-27T04:48:23  <Frontier> on OpenVZ there is no difference between physical memory and virtual memory, so a simple java process will kill the server
2011-05-27T04:48:31  <McLeopold> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=2936
2011-05-27T04:49:03  <aerique> Frontier: same for lisp, i'm going to give it less mem but i hope it is seen by whatever kills the process for using too much
2011-05-27T04:49:12  <Frontier> Different programs have different virtual memory allocation schemes, but I guess all the virtual machine languages will allocate a bit more to counter the impact of their own internal memory managemant

2011-05-27T15:08:44  <amstan> i think it's the same problem that prevented me from executing the visualizer compiling
2011-05-27T15:09:05  <McLeopold> so, server specific?
2011-05-27T15:09:09  <amstan> yes
2011-05-27T15:12:59  <bhasker> asymmetric maps are too unbalanced
2011-05-27T15:13:31  <bhasker> btw symmetric maps are they only symmetric for upto 4 players?
2011-05-27T15:13:50  <McLeopold> they should all be symmetric
2011-05-27T15:13:57  <bhasker> for all players?
2011-05-27T15:13:59  <McLeopold> yes
2011-05-27T15:14:02  <bhasker> hmm
2011-05-27T15:14:05  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=3495
2011-05-27T15:14:10  <bhasker> this map claims to be symmetric
2011-05-27T15:14:19  <McLeopold> each player has a "strip" of the map, the strips are then stacked and offset evenly
2011-05-27T15:14:21  <bhasker> but starting positions don't look symmetric to me
2011-05-27T15:14:31  <bhasker> the closest food for my bot
2011-05-27T15:14:36  <bhasker> is like 10 turns away
2011-05-27T15:14:42  <bhasker> compared to sir_macelons
2011-05-27T15:14:43  <amstan> bhasker: food is not symmetric, for some reason
2011-05-27T15:14:50  <bhasker> well it should  be:-\
2011-05-27T15:14:53  <bhasker> cause if its not
2011-05-27T15:14:57  <bhasker> then some bots grow exponentially

2011-05-27T15:15:10  <bhasker> at that point
2011-05-27T15:15:20  <bhasker> check that map out
2011-05-27T15:15:28  <bhasker> my bot didn't get another ant till like 10 tunr
2011-05-27T15:15:30  <bhasker> turns
2011-05-27T15:15:38  <bhasker> by then the other bot already has 10-15 ants
2011-05-27T15:15:59  <bhasker> maybe an exaggeration sorry
2011-05-27T15:16:02  <amstan> bhasker: i believe the map is symmetric(go to first turn, enable the fog of war, then look inside the circle, all the bots will have the same water formations)
2011-05-27T15:16:04  <bhasker> he has like 4-5
2011-05-27T15:16:12  <amstan> but food is not, and that should be fixed
2011-05-27T15:16:14  <bhasker> yes but food needs to be symmetric
2011-05-27T15:16:25  <bhasker> otherwise growth of bots will be imbalanced
2011-05-27T15:16:50  <McLeopold> antimatroid1 and sigh are the best ones to solve that problem
2011-05-27T15:17:02  <bhasker> kk i think antimatroid has an option

2011-05-27T15:18:38  <hjax> Hmmm would be unwise to find the closest food to an ant by looping through all food and keeping track of which one is closest?
2011-05-27T15:19:00  <hjax> Would it be*
2011-05-27T15:19:02  <bhasker> just do a all pairs search
2011-05-27T15:19:14  <bhasker> where ants and food are the verticies and find the closest ant to each food
2011-05-27T15:19:16  <bhasker> in one sweep
2011-05-27T15:19:36  <bhasker> and route accordingly

2011-05-27T15:39:36  <McLeopold> it looks like the program is trying to allocate 8gig?
2011-05-27T15:41:36  <Frontier> try to divide that by 80
2011-05-27T15:42:55  <McLeopold> Frontier: what do you mean? a compiler options?

2011-05-27T15:44:57  <Frontier> don't listen to me, I have no idea. Just had to set the memory limit for the JVM to 100mb, because it tries to allocate 1gig
2011-05-27T15:45:13  <Frontier> (virtual memory that is)
2011-05-27T15:45:39  <amstan> McLeopold: the problem is that the server has a fake ram\
2011-05-27T15:45:44  <Frontier> *validate* sounds more like it actually tries to access that memory
2011-05-27T15:45:45  <amstan> which you probably can't use
2011-05-27T15:45:54  <amstan> so most programs want to use it, even though they shouldn't
2011-05-27T15:46:26  <amstan> there's only 1GB or real ram, there's another 1GB that you may use, but the processes using it might be killed at any time if the ram is needed
2011-05-27T15:46:28  <Frontier> yeah "burst ram" for the win
2011-05-27T15:46:42  <amstan> McLeopold: could we do with only 1GB?
2011-05-27T15:46:59  <McLeopold> so, how do I compile such that it won't try to allocate 8gig?
2011-05-27T15:48:37  <a1k0n> this is sbcl i imagine?
2011-05-27T15:48:42  <amstan> yes
2011-05-27T15:48:50  <a1k0n> it overcommits on startup for some reason; there's probably a cmdline option
2011-05-27T15:49:28  <Frontier> McLeopold: something else: in the replays can I haz either the scores length be equal to the duration a bot was participating or an additional field for the survival time?
2011-05-27T15:49:32  <amstan> but why is it trying to commit 8GB? even with the fake ram we only have 2GB
2011-05-27T15:49:50  <Frontier> a1k0n: funny fact: the overcommit switch in the kernel is set to 0
2011-05-27T15:50:36  <Frontier> we don't know this actually the case. could be some bug in the display on 64-machines.
2011-05-27T15:51:09  <McLeopold> amstan: I need to pass the argument for compile *and* run

2011-05-27T15:55:15  <aerique> McLeopold: awesome!  thanks, what was the magic number?
2011-05-27T15:56:40  <janzert> the worker setup currently sets a hard memory limit of just over 1GB

2011-05-27T15:56:52  <McLeopold> that should explain the fix
2011-05-27T15:56:54  <janzert> for jails that is
2011-05-27T15:58:09  <janzert> if we think we can get away with 0.5 a gig that would be great
2011-05-27T15:58:34  <aerique> McLeopold: you and CL is going to be a great relationship :)
2011-05-27T15:58:54  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-05-27T15:59:14  <McLeopold> after reading the haskell book, I'm finding it easier to read haskell
2011-05-27T15:59:33  <McLeopold> aerique: let me ask a simple lisp question
2011-05-27T15:59:39  <aerique> There's still this message on my profile: "MyBot.* file with known extension not found." ... seems to be minor
2011-05-27T16:00:15  <McLeopold> it seems with the "magic" of cons cells and list processing, you are always building and reversing lists.  am I doing it wrong?
2011-05-27T16:00:40  * amstan thinks we should have solved this by fixing the host
2011-05-27T16:00:48  <amstan> i have a feeling java will have the same problem
2011-05-27T16:01:01  <McLeopold> loop through one list, build another, but it's backwards
2011-05-27T16:01:10  <aerique> McLeopold: yeah, you're doing it wrong.  that's 1960's lisp, there's other data structures nowadays
2011-05-27T16:01:34  <aerique> McLeopold: but still, what you mention is possible as well.  mostly a matter of preference
2011-05-27T16:01:37  <McLeopold> amstan: yes, but we are running outside of jails right now.  It also doesn't hurt to set limits on the language if we can
2011-05-27T16:03:06  <aerique> McLeopold: what book have you been using for learning (Common?) Lisp?

2011-05-27T16:23:43  <contestbot> amstan: Yes master!
2011-05-27T16:24:52  <jmcarthur> wait they are still on 6.12? wtf
2011-05-27T16:25:02  <amstan> jmcarthur: apparently, is that bad?
2011-05-27T16:25:23  <jmcarthur> not too bad
2011-05-27T16:25:38  <jmcarthur> i'm just surprised. i thought they were using a newer haskell platform, which calls for ghc 7
2011-05-27T16:25:52  <amstan> they probably reverted to fix that bug
2011-05-27T16:25:53  <jmcarthur> 6.12 is what i was wanting to use in the last contest
2011-05-27T16:26:04  <jmcarthur> the bug was ubuntu's own fault
2011-05-27T16:26:10  <amstan> yes
2011-05-27T16:26:20  <jmcarthur> coincidentally, for pairing the wrong version of ghc with the platform version they were using
2011-05-27T16:26:32  <jmcarthur> i guess what they did is revert the platform rather than upgrade ghc
2011-05-27T16:26:35  <amstan> yes, so they just reverted to the old one
2011-05-27T16:26:38  <amstan> yeah
2011-05-27T16:26:46  <jmcarthur> that explains it then
2011-05-27T16:26:51  <jmcarthur> it's perfectly acceptable

2011-05-27T17:00:02  <amstan> that

2011-05-27T17:00:55  <bhasker> this is the new one?
2011-05-27T17:00:57  <bhasker> or the old one
2011-05-27T17:01:09  <McLeopold> this is new
2011-05-27T17:01:13  <bhasker> oh
2011-05-27T17:01:25  <bhasker> so what do you want me to write looks like you already have most it in place
2011-05-27T17:01:38  <McLeopold> but, it needs the engine from aichallenge, instead of the one I wrote
2011-05-27T17:02:19  <McLeopold> It's got a script to run a webserver, a tcpserver, and both from the same script
2011-05-27T17:02:31  <McLeopold> The web side of things is barely there
2011-05-27T17:02:39  <McLeopold> It doesn't have trueskill, or bayeselo
2011-05-27T17:02:59  <bhasker> oh k
2011-05-27T17:03:14  <McLeopold> The goal was standard python only with no dependancies
2011-05-27T17:03:26  <McLeopold> But it might be better of as a django project
2011-05-27T17:03:37  <bhasker> oh k

2011-05-27T17:11:00  <Frontier> by hand
2011-05-27T17:11:25  <Frontier> ... or better by random, then checking agains the sand and water color and other colors

2011-05-27T17:12:46  <amstan> you'll notice there's a normal blue and a purple, they all hang around the same area
2011-05-27T17:12:53  <amstan> but you can barely tell them apart
2011-05-27T17:14:15  <Frontier> cyan and dark purple are ok for me, just the pale blue is a bit difficult.

2011-05-27T17:22:50  <McLeopold> I think I put sigma in there by mistake

2011-05-27T17:30:57  <McLeopold> |      13 |            81 |     70 | {"errors": ["./Bot.cc: In member function 'bool Bot::squadHuntFood(const int&)':\n./Bot.cc:268:28: error: 'INT_MAX' was not declared in this scope\n", "Command 'g++ -O3 -funroll-loops -c -o ./Bot.o ./Bot.cc' had error return code 1"]}
2011-05-27T17:32:14  <bhasker> hmm weird
2011-05-27T17:32:22  <bhasker> INT_MAX Is a part of stdint.h i think
2011-05-27T17:32:48  <bhasker> let me check
2011-05-27T17:33:57  <bhasker> ah i forgot to include stdint

2011-05-27T17:39:21  <bhasker> useful to know when one can expect next game
2011-05-27T17:39:28  <bhasker> both duration and date would be useful
2011-05-27T17:39:35  <bhasker> start time/end time maybe?
2011-05-27T17:39:38  <bhasker> or start+duration

2011-05-27T17:44:03  <bhasker> hmm i guess it makes sense but frankly its confusing
2011-05-27T17:44:08  <bhasker> start+duration is better
2011-05-27T17:44:17  <McLeopold> I want to avoid timezone code

2011-05-27T17:49:28  <McLeopold> do you really care when a game occured?  I would think you only care how old it is?

2011-05-27T18:35:59  <jbroman> (Unless you have some really old hardware; I'm pretty sure XP is still supported for new hardware.)
2011-05-27T18:36:15  <jbroman> There *may* be some DX10/11 effects that you don't get in XP, but I doubt they're hugely significant.
2011-05-27T18:36:16  <mcstar> i mean are they slower, do you know?
2011-05-27T18:37:08  <jbroman> I haven't done back-to-back benchmarks, but I suspect you'll see a negligible difference (e.g. maybe a few FPS).
2011-05-27T18:37:27  <jbroman> (Unless of course the hardware is very old, but in that case Portal 2 would be more of a hog than Win7.)
2011-05-27T18:37:36  <mcstar> 7300gt
2011-05-27T18:37:46  <mcstar> maybe thats old by todays standards
2011-05-27T18:38:44  <mcstar> honestly i hoped you(someone) says definitely XP :D
2011-05-27T18:39:02  <jbroman> If you want to use XP, it'll run under XP.
2011-05-27T18:39:33  <jbroman> Haven't done benchmarks, but my strong instinct is "It really doesn't matter".
2011-05-27T18:40:02  <mcstar> ok thx, the nicer ui might convince me to use 7

2011-05-27T19:04:37  <McLeopold> that was quite the test of a game
2011-05-27T19:04:52  <bhasker> frontier why does your bot stop expanding after a point
2011-05-27T19:05:03  <bhasker> it just sits in its space and doesn't do much
2011-05-27T19:05:42  <Frontier> It is afraid, because it was attacked and has less ants now than some other turn before.
2011-05-27T19:07:25  <Frontier> well at least it keeps the workers busy :p
2011-05-27T19:09:14  <bhasker> but... if you don't expand you have less food
2011-05-27T19:09:18  <bhasker> so growth will stall

2011-05-27T19:09:52  <bhasker> i guess it makes sense sometimes but the other bot keeps expanding you will eventually get overrun
2011-05-27T19:10:31  <bhasker> ah now it shows the trueskill numbers itself instead of the shift?
2011-05-27T19:10:43  <janzert> argh, just got done merging the last compiler.py change into my local changes :/
2011-05-27T19:11:14  <Frontier> bhasker: My bot isn't supposed to be #1. I don't want the competition to go too far already.
2011-05-27T19:11:40  <bhasker> just curious though i doubt i will have time for the real competition
2011-05-27T19:11:44  <bhasker> so playing on beta is fun
2011-05-27T19:11:48  <bhasker> :)
2011-05-27T19:13:58  <Frontier> That's right. I feel the urge to code some swarm ai.

2011-05-27T19:15:08  <McLeopold> plus, now we can show a detected lang even if it fails to compile or pass tests

2011-05-27T19:16:14  <janzert> yeah, the changes are fine I'm just in the middle of rewriting the the languages dict to be a list of named tuples
2011-05-27T19:16:33  <McLeopold> named tuples? aren't we fancy
2011-05-27T19:16:47  <McLeopold> just go to class at that point
2011-05-27T19:16:56  <janzert> it was easier than going to a class :)
2011-05-27T19:17:23  <McLeopold> Frontier: that outline is supposed to have some info in it :(
2011-05-27T19:17:57  <janzert> mainly, it allowed me incrementally rewrite the indexing operations to attribute access
2011-05-27T19:18:33  <Frontier> McLeopold: no, the error messages aren't displayed.
2011-05-27T19:18:54  <Frontier> They were in a previous version, but they killed the layout because the lines were too long

2011-05-27T19:22:30  <McLeopold> I'm closer :)
2011-05-27T19:23:57  <Frontier> it is an object containing one property which is an array with one string element. I wonder what else can be in the json.
2011-05-27T19:24:58  <Frontier> ah no there are 2 elements in the array. i didn't see the compiler.py message
2011-05-27T19:27:15  <Frontier> left-align and force line-breaks or make the area scrollable
2011-05-27T19:27:56  <Frontier> These error messages in D are really hard to read: ./MyBot.d(74): Error: template std.random.uniform(string boundaries = "[)",T1,T2,UniformRandomNumberGenerator) if (is(CommonType!(T1,UniformRandomNumberGenerator) == void) && !is(CommonType!(T1,T2) == void)) cannot deduce template function from argument types !()(int,int)

2011-05-27T19:29:51  <JimmFlimm> hehe
2011-05-27T19:30:00  <janzert> Also compilation errors should only be shown to the logged in user in their own profile.

2011-05-27T19:30:11  <janzert> i.e. you shouldn't be able to see other players error messages
2011-05-27T19:30:46  <Frontier> janzert: would be nice if the #1 player used a language that printed the whole source code in an error message *g*

2011-05-27T19:48:10  <bhasker> question the attackradius is sqrt(2) right?
2011-05-27T19:48:14  <bhasker> or is it 1?
2011-05-27T19:48:17  <hjax> What does the direction function return if there's more than 2 spaces between the points?
2011-05-27T19:48:31  <antimatroid1> the reason why the engine isn't using symmetric spawning by default is because the map files still don't have a parameter indicating which type of symmetry (if any) they are using
2011-05-27T19:48:49  <antimatroid1> neither is the engine looking for one
2011-05-27T19:49:07  <bhasker> ah the person i want to talk to
2011-05-27T19:49:08  <bhasker> antimatroid
2011-05-27T19:49:16  <antimatroid1> :P
2011-05-27T19:49:23  <antimatroid1> attack radius is sqrt(2 )
2011-05-27T19:49:28  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=3652
2011-05-27T19:49:29  <bhasker> this game
2011-05-27T19:49:41  <bhasker> i am confused some of my ants are vanishing close to two ants which are in a line
2011-05-27T19:50:13  <bhasker> like goto turn 70
2011-05-27T19:50:34  <bhasker> i am reasonably sure i am not suiciding ants
2011-05-27T19:50:46  <bhasker> if you look in the middle of the map
2011-05-27T19:50:53  <bhasker> about 1/3rd way down
2011-05-27T19:51:00  <bhasker> there are lke 6 pale green ants
2011-05-27T19:51:00  <antimatroid1> protip: go to move 79, then click the "next move" button
2011-05-27T19:51:03  <antimatroid1> it'll animate the move
2011-05-27T19:51:21  <antimatroid1> zoon in and you can also hover over ants to look at what's inside range etc. anyway, back to lookign at your problem :)(
2011-05-27T19:51:34  <bhasker> so this looks wrong
2011-05-27T19:51:46  <bhasker> so two ants behind one another
2011-05-27T19:51:51  <bhasker> will clobber ants in their way
2011-05-27T19:51:56  <bhasker> solo ants
2011-05-27T19:52:08  <bhasker> that doesn't seem right
2011-05-27T19:52:12  <bhasker> that an ant which is not adjacent
2011-05-27T19:52:16  <bhasker> can do damage
2011-05-27T19:52:57  <antimatroid1> i'm so confused :\

2011-05-27T19:53:46  <bhasker> doesn't that seem weird

2011-05-27T21:35:17  <hjax> Hmmm my new bot won't work :/, it's probably another very small mistake that doesn't let it play the game
2011-05-27T21:39:23  <hjax> How long should a bot be?
2011-05-27T21:40:19  <Frontier> There is no practical limit on the length of source code.
2011-05-27T21:41:17  <hjax> Well my food finding code is 15 lines, and I can't even make it work :/, how do people do a several hundred line bot?
2011-05-27T21:41:36  <Frontier> They are older and wiser
2011-05-27T21:42:01  <hjax> You are telling this to the 14 year old noob lol
2011-05-27T21:42:54  * hjax goes to stare at source code until the problem is found
2011-05-27T21:43:03  <Frontier> Looking back at my first code, that was horrible. I didn't know what a call stack is and so I always jumped into functions, but never returned in a QBasic program until it crashed.

2011-05-27T21:44:57  <Frontier> D
2011-05-27T21:45:09  <hjax> What is D?
2011-05-27T21:45:20  <Frontier> It is something akin to C
2011-05-27T21:45:27  <hjax> Lol
2011-05-27T21:46:00  <hjax> Im happy with python :P
2011-05-27T21:46:03  <janzert> it's the language C++ should have been ;)
2011-05-27T21:46:51  <Frontier> If you really want to know, this is the homepage: http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/
2011-05-27T21:47:52  <Frontier> It is low level enough to write os kernels with it, but has stuff like strings and associative arrays built-in.
2011-05-27T21:47:59  <hjax> Interesting
2011-05-27T21:48:27  <Frontier> and also a garbage collector (that you can disable on a case by case basis)
2011-05-27T21:49:07  <hjax> I'll brb in 10 min with the results of me trying to make my algorithm for food collecting work
2011-05-27T21:50:21  <hjax> Low level language with a garbage collector? It is what C++ should have been

2011-05-27T22:24:01  <amstan> i'm confused on how it worked then on that test server
2011-05-27T22:24:29  <janzert> yeah, there wasn't a ppa involved right?
2011-05-27T22:24:33  <amstan> oh yes! now i see it
2011-05-27T22:24:37  <amstan> i only have ghc installed
2011-05-27T22:24:41  <amstan> but not the whole platform

2011-05-27T22:25:07  <amstan> janzert: k, i'm open for getting the debs for 64 bits as well, but i'll need a place to store it

2011-05-27T22:25:37  <janzert> I'm not familiar enough with haskell to know if not having the full platform is a real problem for the contest

2011-05-27T22:26:10  <janzert> I'm leaning toward https://launchpad.net/~brcha/+archive/ppa if the full platform is needed
2011-05-27T22:26:33  <amstan> seems to be new
2011-05-27T22:26:47  <amstan> does it work?
2011-05-27T22:27:02  <janzert> it was mentioned in the bug about the package being broken
2011-05-27T22:27:08  <janzert> haven't actually tested it yet
2011-05-27T22:28:00  <amstan> it seems that the ppa is just an old one
2011-05-27T22:28:08  <amstan> i think it would be better if we go with the ones from debian
2011-05-27T22:28:14  <amstan> they were tested by jmcartur
2011-05-27T22:29:39  <janzert> sure, feel free to modify the setup to install it
2011-05-27T22:29:58  <amstan> i still want a place to store them
2011-05-27T22:30:06  <janzert> ahh :)
2011-05-27T22:30:12  <janzert> make a launchpad ppa
2011-05-27T22:30:21  <amstan> i can't, it's against launchpad rules
2011-05-27T22:30:31  <amstan> it's a lot more everhead with launchpad
2011-05-27T22:30:34  <janzert> :(
2011-05-27T22:30:53  <amstan> they don't want unmodified debian packages in there for some reason
2011-05-27T22:30:54  <Frontier> ha! I found a broken replay: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=3735
2011-05-27T22:31:20  <amstan> Frontier: what's going on?
2011-05-27T22:31:24  <janzert> is there a way to list the debian source for apt to pull from directly?
2011-05-27T22:31:37  <janzert> just for the haskell packages
2011-05-27T22:31:51  <amstan> i'm not sure, i did it kinda sketchy last time
2011-05-27T22:32:06  <amstan> i didn't actually get haskell-platform either(which is a metapackage)
2011-05-27T22:32:13  <amstan> i got all subpackages that didn't break everything
2011-05-27T22:32:16  <janzert> hehe, "Error name: Error"
2011-05-27T22:32:45  <amstan> Frontier: you should print the link to the replay file when there's an error
2011-05-27T22:32:47  <Frontier> amstan: the 3rd and in the replay has a command string that is too short for its actual life span.
2011-05-27T22:33:12  <amstan> janzert: oh, right, can i make you an account to the beta server?
2011-05-27T22:33:35  <Frontier> amstan: I hope errors wont be so often that it justifies the work ^^
2011-05-27T22:33:45  <janzert> I'm not sure what I'd use it for right at the moment but I'm not opposed I suppose :)
2011-05-27T22:34:07  <amstan> janzert: well, we have a few issues with the sandbox instalation
2011-05-27T22:34:15  <amstan> i was wondering if you could give it a try
2011-05-27T22:34:16  <Frontier> copy the line saying "game/3735" and replace the path part of the url with it.
2011-05-27T22:34:18  <amstan> maybe as another user
2011-05-27T22:34:26  <amstan> contest_sandbox
2011-05-27T22:34:44  <amstan> Frontier: it doesn't work if the error is on the homepage
2011-05-27T22:34:46  <janzert> hmm, well the sandbox jails are global to the server
2011-05-27T22:34:57  <amstan> janzert: yes, still, it's broken
2011-05-27T22:34:57  <janzert> i.e. /srv/chroot/...
2011-05-27T22:35:11  <amstan> and you could test it without affecting the unsandboxed worker
2011-05-27T22:35:15  <janzert> I suppose I can try and poke around
2011-05-27T22:35:46  <janzert> did the jails install?
2011-05-27T22:36:01  <amstan> janzert: i got the /srv/chroot stuff installed
2011-05-27T22:36:07  <amstan> but there's a fuse error or something
2011-05-27T22:36:18  <amstan> janzert: ssh janzert@aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com
2011-05-27T22:36:21  <janzert> hmm, ok
2011-05-27T22:37:03  <amstan> set to expire when you login
2011-05-27T22:38:03  <amstan> janzert: oh.. and i found a way to speed up the sandbox installation, you copy /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb to the sandbox in the same place
2011-05-27T22:38:08  <amstan> while it's retrieving the packages
2011-05-27T22:38:13  <amstan> and it'll skip the ones it already has
2011-05-27T22:39:33  <janzert> nice,
2011-05-27T22:44:47  <janzert> the beta server is running under openvz?
2011-05-27T22:44:54  <Frontier> yep
2011-05-27T22:44:55  <amstan> janzert: i think so
2011-05-27T22:45:17  <janzert> ok, that's probably the problem with the fuse filesystems
2011-05-27T22:45:26  <janzert> you need a special openvz kernel
2011-05-27T22:45:35  <janzert> http://wiki.openvz.org/FUSE
2011-05-27T22:45:48  <janzert> probably not worth the hassle of getting
2011-05-27T22:45:52  <amstan> it seems to break other things too
