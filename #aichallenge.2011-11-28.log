2011-11-28T00:00:39  <bhasker`> hmm probably
2011-11-28T00:00:59  <bhasker`> i am trying pledge algo out but it causes ants to do the same circuit
2011-11-28T00:01:01  <bhasker`> too many times
2011-11-28T00:01:09  <bhasker`> or i am missing something in my implementation
2011-11-28T00:01:20  <p_l> also, not having a way to change proxy setting in UI is ... so much FAIL I can't explain it in words.
2011-11-28T00:01:47  <thestinger> p_l: what OS are on you?
2011-11-28T00:01:50  <bhasker`> they rely on the system UI
2011-11-28T00:01:52  <amstan> p_l: i did it a few days ago just fine
2011-11-28T00:02:00  <bhasker`> so if you are on windows they will use the windows setting
2011-11-28T00:02:01  <bhasker`> same on mac
2011-11-28T00:02:08  <bhasker`> not sure how it works on linux though
2011-11-28T00:02:14  <amstan> bhasker`: good
2011-11-28T00:02:16  <thestinger> there are proxy env variables
2011-11-28T00:02:21  <thestinger> distros like ubuntu have a frontend
2011-11-28T00:02:26  <p_l> bhasker`: in short, it doesn't
2011-11-28T00:02:29  <thestinger> http_proxy iirc
2011-11-28T00:02:30  <amstan> oh...
2011-11-28T00:02:31  <bhasker`> amstan?
2011-11-28T00:02:42  <amstan> it seems to be using the kde proxy settings
2011-11-28T00:02:46  <p_l> thestinger: restarting a browser to change proxy is not a solution
2011-11-28T00:02:50  <amstan> i didn't notice that actually
2011-11-28T00:02:53  <thestinger> amstan: yeah, try echo $http_proxy in a terminal
2011-11-28T00:03:08  <thestinger> p_l: it does suck, but you can set it with a UI :)
2011-11-28T00:03:10  <amstan> thestinger: i don't have it set right now
2011-11-28T00:03:17  <amstan> thestinger: also.. i didn't have to restart my browser
2011-11-28T00:03:41  <thestinger> well, you probably don't have to restart it on linux if they did it in a smart way
2011-11-28T00:03:52  <p_l> thestinger: I'm running linux. It means I don't have the retarded windows registry emulation used by GNOME and others which is used by Chrome to read proxy settings
2011-11-28T00:04:09  <thestinger> like if you change the GTK theme in GNOME or Xfce, all the apps use the new theme immediately
2011-11-28T00:04:24  <thestinger> yeah, chromium uses gconf
2011-11-28T00:04:30  <p_l> thestinger: the theme changes are actually not-gconf related
2011-11-28T00:04:31  <thestinger> yet another reason why I don't use it :)
2011-11-28T00:04:39  <thestinger> p_l: XSETTINGS or whatever?
2011-11-28T00:04:45  <thestinger> or just gtk
2011-11-28T00:04:45  <bhasker`> isn't there a plugin that makes this easier?
2011-11-28T00:04:54  <p_l> bhasker`: no
2011-11-28T00:04:57  <bhasker`> mostly the thing i like about chrome is the bookmark sync
2011-11-28T00:05:08  <bhasker`> i know firefox has somethin similar but i like chromes implementation more
2011-11-28T00:05:12  <p_l> bhasker`: such things are outside the possibilities of Chrome api
2011-11-28T00:05:19  <bhasker`> ah
2011-11-28T00:05:58  <bhasker`> i a missing something in my pledge algo's implementation
2011-11-28T00:06:08  <bhasker`> its supposed to be be capable of breaking out of a G
2011-11-28T00:06:12  <bhasker`> my ants never do:(
2011-11-28T00:06:39  <thestinger> I just stick all unexplored locations as targets on a distance map, seems to work fine
2011-11-28T00:06:52  <thestinger> multi-source BFS makes it fast
2011-11-28T00:07:31  <Antimony> Hey I beat BenJAckson! http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1810

2011-11-28T00:07:54  <bhasker`> maybe i should just try that
2011-11-28T00:08:14  <bhasker`> my earlier algo used to pick moves based on what increases vision the most
2011-11-28T00:08:24  <bhasker`> which works nicely on maps with sparse water
2011-11-28T00:08:30  <thestinger> bhasker`: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1753 seems to work fine (I'm strcat_next)
2011-11-28T00:08:30  <bhasker`> ants tend to spread rapidly
2011-11-28T00:08:37  <thestinger> it actually works better on mazes
2011-11-28T00:08:45  <bhasker`> hmm k
2011-11-28T00:08:58  <thestinger> my ants prefer taking paths that don't lead through places my ants are currently located
2011-11-28T00:09:05  <thestinger> so they go in different directions at the start
2011-11-28T00:09:17  <thestinger> works well in mazes

2011-11-28T00:29:23  <oelewapperke> thestinger: what's multi-source BFS ?
2011-11-28T00:29:39  <oelewapperke> breath first search ? Doesn't sound fast
2011-11-28T00:30:11  <thestinger> BFS is fast if you're not abusing it for pathfinding from 1 location to 1 location
2011-11-28T00:30:32  <thestinger> a BFS from a target gets you distances and best paths from every location to that target
2011-11-28T00:31:12  <thestinger> multi-source BFS is just putting multiple nodes into the FIFO queue before you start
2011-11-28T00:31:24  <oelewapperke> thestinger: don't you have to run that algorithm for every target every turn ?
2011-11-28T00:31:34  <thestinger> I do, but you don't have to
2011-11-28T00:31:42  <thestinger> why would I save them?
2011-11-28T00:31:47  <thestinger> it takes 1ms for 7k targets
2011-11-28T00:31:52  <thestinger> well, less than 1ms
2011-11-28T00:32:11  <oelewapperke> cool. C++ ?
2011-11-28T00:32:14  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-28T00:32:34  <oelewapperke> how do you make sure you use different ants for different targets ?
2011-11-28T00:32:54  <thestinger> for food, I do a separate BFS from each food
2011-11-28T00:32:57  <oelewapperke> or do you just generate the full "nextHop" array for every target ?
2011-11-28T00:33:07  <thestinger> I just store distances in a 2d array
2011-11-28T00:33:10  <oelewapperke> ah so you end up with N(food) arrays each
2011-11-28T00:33:10  <thestinger> from every tile
2011-11-28T00:33:21  <thestinger> well, I just have 1 2d array at a time for food
2011-11-28T00:33:43  <thestinger> you just need to check which of the 4 directions get you closer to the target in the distance map
2011-11-28T00:33:51  <thestinger> and it's getting you the shortest path due to how BFS works
2011-11-28T00:33:51  <oelewapperke> how do you divide up your ants between the food ?
2011-11-28T00:34:13  <oelewapperke> I've been thinking about using linear programming, and while it's optimal it's not exactly fast
2011-11-28T00:34:27  <thestinger> just like the tutorial does it basically
2011-11-28T00:34:38  <thestinger> distances come from the BFS, same with pathfinding
2011-11-28T00:35:01  <thestinger> except I treat 2 food right next to each other as 1 target
2011-11-28T00:35:14  <thestinger> within ~3 distance
2011-11-28T00:35:35  <thestinger> that part doesn't matter, it hasn't improved my bot at all
2011-11-28T00:35:58  <thestinger> it just seems like a good thing but I can't measure an improvement
2011-11-28T00:36:30  <thestinger> sometimes it's probably a good idea to send more than 1 ant anyway
2011-11-28T00:36:53  <oelewapperke> so all you're doing is building arrays ?
2011-11-28T00:37:06  <thestinger> yeah, 2d arrays with distance to the nearest target
2011-11-28T00:37:35  <oelewapperke> I have something like that, except I "cache" the results to gain time
2011-11-28T00:37:35  <thestinger> so there's an enemy_hill_distances one, etc.
2011-11-28T00:38:07  <oelewapperke> once I send an ant to a food or an enemy hill, it's on a "mission" and has stored the path
2011-11-28T00:38:12  <thestinger> my pre-combat stuff just takes 4ms (doesn't really scale based on # of ants)
2011-11-28T00:38:40  <oelewapperke> then it follows the path until it either hits the food/hill, dies, or hits a wall it didn't know about when creating it's path
2011-11-28T00:39:24  <oelewapperke> how do you decide when/how many ants to send to enemy hill ?
2011-11-28T00:39:30  <oelewapperke> (and do you avoid enemy ants ?)

2011-11-28T00:40:09  <thestinger> oelewapperke: I don't avoid enemy ants
2011-11-28T00:40:20  <thestinger> I intend for that to be handled by combat (working on it atm)
2011-11-28T00:41:28  <oelewapperke> how do you debug ?
2011-11-28T00:41:35  <oelewapperke> that's something I'm struggling with
2011-11-28T00:41:42  <thestinger> stderr :)
2011-11-28T00:42:02  <thestinger> there's a nice debugging visualizer, but I haven't used it
2011-11-28T00:42:14  <oelewapperke> ah :) I'm working in eclipse, but I can't figure it out
2011-11-28T00:42:21  <thestinger> you can draw stuff in the visualizer used for replays with that
2011-11-28T00:42:51  <oelewapperke> any docs for the debugging visualizer ?
2011-11-28T00:43:27  <thestinger> https://github.com/j-h-a/aichallenge/blob/vis_overlay/VIS_OVERLAY.md
2011-11-28T00:43:39  <thestinger> just found that actually :)
2011-11-28T00:44:19  <thestinger> you just need to replace the tools dir with the one from that git repo
2011-11-28T00:45:28  <BenJackson> Antimony: You're Parasprites?
2011-11-28T00:45:36  <Antimony> yep

2011-11-28T00:46:14  <BenJackson> bj_v8b or v8 is the current one
2011-11-28T00:46:19  <BenJackson> (they're both running)
2011-11-28T00:46:25  <thestinger> nice... I caused a double free() error without using malloc/free
2011-11-28T00:46:43  <thestinger> cutting and pasting this code above some other code didn't work out very well xD
2011-11-28T00:47:24  <BenJackson> Antimony: your bot looks pretty good there
2011-11-28T00:47:54  <BenJackson> how's it doing on on aichallenge?
2011-11-28T00:47:57  <Antimony> thanks

2011-11-28T00:48:41  <thestinger> I just don't find the official site helpful
2011-11-28T00:48:48  <thestinger> well I mean replays/ranking
2011-11-28T00:48:51  <BenJackson> I go back to work tomorrow
2011-11-28T00:49:02  <BenJackson> so I figured if I didn't draw a line it'd be hard to focus at work :)
2011-11-28T00:49:17  <thestinger> just get your boss playing ants :)

2011-11-28T00:49:57  <Antimony> oh dear, I timed out
2011-11-28T00:49:58  <Antimony> somehow
2011-11-28T00:50:01  <BenJackson> there's a guy there who is into AI stuff but for some reason I can't get him to participate
2011-11-28T00:50:16  <thestinger> BenJackson: http://sprunge.us/fhEc this is what my new combat code does
2011-11-28T00:50:34  <thestinger> for each battle
2011-11-28T00:50:47  <thestinger> so it would choose not to attack for that one
2011-11-28T00:50:56  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@man-208-94.pks.muni.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-28T00:51:09  <BenJackson> I basically do that
2011-11-28T00:51:11  <thestinger> I just sort of threw it together in 5 mins...
2011-11-28T00:51:14  <BenJackson> except I do all combinations
2011-11-28T00:51:18  <thestinger> my other attempts have taken a lot longer
2011-11-28T00:51:25  <thestinger> BenJackson: how do you do combat for big battles then?
2011-11-28T00:51:40  <BenJackson> the clever bit is making a fast evaluation function
2011-11-28T00:51:57  <thestinger> I can see that
2011-11-28T00:52:33  <BenJackson> other bots "suicide" into me because I an choosing positions that min/max every possible thing they do
2011-11-28T00:52:52  <BenJackson> the main reason I lose battles is simply not having the right ants there in the first place
2011-11-28T00:52:58  <BenJackson> since there's no deliberate planning ahead
2011-11-28T00:53:13  <Antimony> wow
2011-11-28T00:53:19  <thestinger> my bot sucks at actual combat, but they just end up in the right place :)
2011-11-28T00:53:27  <BenJackson> when I first got "even ant distribution" working my bot was much worse
2011-11-28T00:53:34  <BenJackson> since lone ants can't do much for combat
2011-11-28T00:53:40  <Antimony> That's the stage I'm at
2011-11-28T00:53:46  <BenJackson> Antimony: I'm talking about the v8 version, not the old one
2011-11-28T00:53:53  <Antimony> I'm trying to make it so that ants are more likely to bunch up around hills
2011-11-28T00:53:57  <Antimony> so that they can win combat
2011-11-28T00:54:11  <BenJackson> the old one really only tried to make the outcomes bad for the enemy and avoid 1v1 suicide
2011-11-28T00:54:19  <BenJackson> you can see my old bot accepting 2v2 suicide all the time
2011-11-28T00:54:34  <thestinger> the three strcats that are playing right now just assume enemies don't move and minimize losses
2011-11-28T00:54:41  <Antimony> I wonder why my bot timed out
2011-11-28T00:54:46  <thestinger> they don't even check a score for different possibilities
2011-11-28T00:54:48  <Antimony> it shouldn't really be possible for my bot to time out on tcp
2011-11-28T00:55:02  <Antimony> Hey that's what I do!
2011-11-28T00:55:03  <BenJackson> could be a network glitch
2011-11-28T00:55:05  <thestinger> I have ~4 different combat implementations now but none are playing on tcp because I don't like them :)
2011-11-28T00:55:23  <Antimony> Unfortuantely you don't usaully fight stationary enemies
2011-11-28T00:55:26  <thestinger> this one will be a big improvement over what I have
2011-11-28T00:55:36  <BenJackson> sometimes there are ridiculous stalemates with stationary enemies, though
2011-11-28T00:55:36  <thestinger> Antimony: yeah, so my bot barely beats a version of itself without combat
2011-11-28T00:56:02  <BenJackson> the other thing is that once your bot is combat aware your lone ants become very deferential to enemy ants
2011-11-28T00:56:06  <BenJackson> whereas before they suicided them
2011-11-28T00:56:08  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-28T00:56:10  <BenJackson> which may be better for territory
2011-11-28T00:56:10  <thestinger> I did that manually
2011-11-28T00:56:17  <thestinger> my foragers avoid enemy ants if they're all lone
2011-11-28T00:56:18  <BenJackson> or even chased them off if they were combat aware and you weren't
2011-11-28T00:56:19  <thestinger> alone*
2011-11-28T00:56:25  <thestinger> well
2011-11-28T00:56:27  <thestinger> in 1v1 games
2011-11-28T00:56:32  <thestinger> they are aggressive
2011-11-28T00:56:48  <thestinger> in 8 player FFA they are cautious as hell :)
2011-11-28T00:56:55  <BenJackson> btw the other "how do you do it fast" is that I finally partitioned the combats into individual (unrelated) combats
2011-11-28T00:56:59  <BenJackson> so each one is simpler
2011-11-28T00:57:03  <thestinger> ah
2011-11-28T00:57:11  <BenJackson> which was an interesting exercise
2011-11-28T00:57:21  <thestinger> I partition stuff into battles, but I've been much too lazy to actually fix the evaluation function to only evaluate for those
2011-11-28T00:57:24  <BenJackson> I never had a use for union-find before
2011-11-28T00:57:43  <thestinger> making everything const and using lambdas everywhere was more fun :)
2011-11-28T00:57:44  <BenJackson> interesting offshoot of that is that now I can know if I'm locally outnumbered
2011-11-28T00:57:55  <oelewapperke> how do you evaluate a battle ? Just count your ants vs enemy ants ?
2011-11-28T00:57:59  <BenJackson> no lambdas for me, the craziest I've gotten is functors
2011-11-28T00:58:02  <BenJackson> well, and several templates
2011-11-28T00:58:06  <BenJackson> like the bfs iterator
2011-11-28T00:58:08  <thestinger> lambdas cut my code size down from a ridiculous 1700 lines to 900 lines
2011-11-28T00:58:16  <thestinger> it also made the compiled binary a _lot_ smaller
2011-11-28T00:58:21  <BenJackson> huh
2011-11-28T00:58:26  <thestinger> I really suck at code reuse with C++'s OOP
2011-11-28T00:58:34  <thestinger> I'm just used to higher-order functions for code reuse...
2011-11-28T00:58:51  <BenJackson> oelewapperke: you just have to literally evaluate the combat rules
2011-11-28T00:58:58  <BenJackson> which were actually designed to be fairly simple to evaluate
2011-11-28T00:59:12  <BenJackson> if you take shortcuts your combat will have exploitable flaws
2011-11-28T00:59:18  <thestinger> like I have a single BFS implementation now
2011-11-28T00:59:21  <BenJackson> but you can go really far even with "bad" combat
2011-11-28T00:59:30  <BenJackson> I have two
2011-11-28T00:59:47  <BenJackson> my iterator and the one built into one of my early data structures
2011-11-28T00:59:50  <thestinger> I have wrappers for it (one for radius stuff, one for movement)
2011-11-28T01:00:10  <thestinger> but the wrappers are just like 1 line
2011-11-28T01:00:28  <oelewapperke> ah cool you can actually kill enemy ants without losing ants of your own
2011-11-28T01:00:37  <BenJackson> yes
2011-11-28T01:00:44  <BenJackson> but IMO the combat rules are not that great
2011-11-28T01:00:54  <thestinger> [this](Location loc, unsigned distance) { set this->something to something or whatever };

2011-11-28T01:17:29  <thestinger> ok, the new combat code seems equally bad as my old code which is a great sign - because it's barely started and runs much faster :D
2011-11-28T01:18:15  <BenJackson> janzert: kind of my point, actually
2011-11-28T01:18:33  <BenJackson> had the same score before both, but due to reducing sigma now mu is moving slower
2011-11-28T01:19:08  <BenJackson> it will settle out eventually, it's just slow with the current game rate
2011-11-28T01:19:22  <BenJackson> janzert: as long as you looked at that game, though, that's clearly a bad setup
2011-11-28T01:19:30  <BenJackson> high player count, multi-hill, low food rate
2011-11-28T01:19:33  <janzert> BenJackson: heh? it will take 3 games at most to recover the mu and the sigma will then be lower so rank much higher. skill recovered fully in the very next game
2011-11-28T01:20:09  <janzert> assuming you win each of those three games of course
2011-11-28T01:20:29  <BenJackson> sure, but the process of lose 1, win 3 takes 15 hours

2011-11-28T01:21:38  <janzert> ok, so it's just a game rate complaint ;) 3 games isn't that much extra to rank up from my view
2011-11-28T01:22:19  <janzert> and yeah, I don't care for the big dump of hills maps :P
2011-11-28T01:22:23  <BenJackson> well my constructive complaint would be that the settings are poor for ranking bots
2011-11-28T01:22:30  <BenJackson> it was going to be a pretty random outcome no matter what
2011-11-28T01:22:55  <a1k0n> it'd be nice to extend trueskill to infer a variance for each map
2011-11-28T01:23:01  <a1k0n> and do a whole-history ranking
2011-11-28T01:23:29  <thestinger> just need to get rid of the silly random walks :)
2011-11-28T01:23:37  <BenJackson> turn 100 there are like 10 ants per bot and 15 hills have been taken

2011-11-28T01:24:54  <janzert> of course much more diluted since the cell maze maps are about half of the total at the moment

2011-11-28T01:25:07  <BenJackson> I like multi-hill maps ok despite initial randomness.  but with very little food the random phase lasts much longer
2011-11-28T01:25:49  <BenJackson> one nice thing about them is that if you are right next to a good bot and lose a hill to it early it's ok
2011-11-28T01:25:57  <a1k0n> whoa.  cell_maze_p08_01 is pretty epic.  i approve.
2011-11-28T01:25:58  <BenJackson> the game sort of naturally selects your safer hills

2011-11-28T01:28:56  <BenJackson> several of the cell maps have those tapering necks that are prone to stalemates
2011-11-28T01:29:14  <a1k0n> but they need not be stalemates
2011-11-28T01:29:28  <a1k0n> you can make an unfavorable exchange of ants for a favorable exchange in position
2011-11-28T01:29:32  <thestinger> the cell mazes are awesome :)
2011-11-28T01:29:39  <thestinger> you can usually just take an alternate route
2011-11-28T01:30:00  <_flag> The problem is you have little vision over the map and it's often unclear whether the exchange will result in a favourable position
2011-11-28T01:30:08  <a1k0n> true
2011-11-28T01:30:22  <_flag> So bots tend just to accept the stalemate
2011-11-28T01:30:22  <a1k0n> i'm assuming the hill is in sight
2011-11-28T01:30:32  <BenJackson> oh, right, you can always suicide at 3 wide because of the limited attack radius
2011-11-28T01:30:32  <BenJackson> hm
2011-11-28T01:30:47  <a1k0n> yeah.  if they have 4 ants or whatever they might be able to keep one
2011-11-28T01:31:39  <a1k0n> so far my experiment in a more conservative bot (a1k0n_b) is weaker than my more aggressive attacker
2011-11-28T01:32:01  <a1k0n> p > 0.95 or so anyway
2011-11-28T01:33:00  <a1k0n> (of course it still does a bunch of dumb stuff, so it may not be true in general)
2011-11-28T01:33:08  <roflmao> i have the same experience :P
2011-11-28T01:33:14  <roflmao> better to be too brash than too coward
2011-11-28T01:33:28  <a1k0n> lest some bastard steal your hill kills
2011-11-28T01:34:39  <a1k0n> it's very interesting how _flag and some of hte stronger bots just kinda "fire" their ants out of the hill at the cardinal directions alternately
2011-11-28T01:35:00  <a1k0n> xathis's go more diagonal but still
2011-11-28T01:35:21  <roflmao> yeah i want to do that
2011-11-28T01:35:32  <a1k0n> whoa BenJackson is beating A_experimental now
2011-11-28T01:36:00  <a1k0n> (or is closely tied with, probability-wise)

2011-11-28T01:36:43  <roflmao> fair enough
2011-11-28T01:36:50  <Antimony> which will take about two weeks
2011-11-28T01:36:55  <roflmao> yeh :-\
2011-11-28T01:37:00  <Antimony> knowing the game rate
2011-11-28T01:37:29  <a1k0n> are you minimaxing?
2011-11-28T01:37:32  <BenJackson> I was hoping I'd shoot to top 10, then I could say "well, good enough" and quit obsessing
2011-11-28T01:37:49  <a1k0n> def top 10
2011-11-28T01:37:58  <BenJackson> I couldn't figure out how to literally minmax
2011-11-28T01:38:05  <BenJackson> although that's what I assumed I'd do at the very start
2011-11-28T01:38:05  <a1k0n> my bot is in the top 10 (but mostly because of resubmissions) and i'm kinda done with it but not done
2011-11-28T01:38:20  <BenJackson> it's not a turn-taking game, so minmax doesn't quite apply
2011-11-28T01:38:27  <a1k0n> yeah the problem is you can't actually assume you know the best minimum value for a candidate move cuz you can't test all possibilities
2011-11-28T01:38:36  <a1k0n> agreed
2011-11-28T01:39:01  <BenJackson> so really it's all about putting yourself in the most advantageous position
2011-11-28T01:39:06  <antimatroid> a1k0n: can i talk collecting targets with path finding with you? :P
2011-11-28T01:39:07  <a1k0n> if you can actually apply it you get a conservative move that doesn't kill your ants
2011-11-28T01:39:24  <BenJackson> I think lots of top bots have probably maximized individual bot placement
2011-11-28T01:39:27  <a1k0n> antimatroid: heh, cuz i'm so clearly good at it?
2011-11-28T01:39:31  <BenJackson> we all "look" the same
2011-11-28T01:39:31  <antimatroid> ie. are you reusing ants ever? are you using a* or bfs? are you restarting searches after collecting each item or updating search info?
2011-11-28T01:39:36  <antimatroid> a1k0n: :P
2011-11-28T01:39:43  <BenJackson> the next step is having the right ants in the fight in the first place
2011-11-28T01:39:53  <a1k0n> antimatroid: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=133645&user=432
2011-11-28T01:39:59  <antimatroid> i'm just finding it REALLY messy to do simultaneous bfs's from ants if one is reusing moved ants
2011-11-28T01:40:14  <roflmao> benjackson: putting yourself in the right place, not focus on winning the battle
2011-11-28T01:40:17  <antimatroid> and not restarting the searches for each collected target
2011-11-28T01:40:19  <roflmao> you just described the problem with my bot
2011-11-28T01:40:29  <a1k0n> oh.  well you can incrementally update your map of distance-from-your-ants
2011-11-28T01:40:40  <antimatroid> it's also a pita that you don't want to walk onto targets when collecting food, but do for say collecting unseen squares
2011-11-28T01:40:57  <Antimony> you can't walk onto an unseen square
2011-11-28T01:41:23  <BenJackson> I never have fixed the "walk next to food not TO food" bug in my bot
2011-11-28T01:41:32  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i thought of that, it's a bit messy as well but probably the best
2011-11-28T01:41:32  <BenJackson> except for avoiding trying to walk RIGHT ONTO food
2011-11-28T01:42:06  <antimatroid> actually, i think that might just be messier
2011-11-28T01:42:21  <a1k0n> well, i do that
2011-11-28T01:43:07  <antimatroid> do you just store which ants can get to a location in the found distance? then if you move an ant and that goes to zero how do you make sure that gets searched properly again from old searched squares?
2011-11-28T01:43:35  <a1k0n> er?  no, i just use it to determine distance to food and unseen squares
2011-11-28T01:43:52  <a1k0n> and assue the closest ant is the one who takes care of that
2011-11-28T01:43:58  <a1k0n> i don't do anything fancy
2011-11-28T01:44:42  <BenJackson> my original C++ bot just figured out the distance and direction of every goal at every ant
2011-11-28T01:44:44  <a1k0n> for like, distance to hills, i just have a distance-from-hill map
2011-11-28T01:44:47  <BenJackson> which you can do basically simultaneously
2011-11-28T01:44:56  <BenJackson> and then each ant took the closest goal direction
2011-11-28T01:45:01  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-11-28T01:45:04  <BenJackson> plus some scaling of distance with breakpoints
2011-11-28T01:45:06  <antimatroid> yeah but when you move an ant, you need to 1. remove all its old path information (except that it shared with friends) and if reusing the ant 2. add it's target locations moves to the search queue
2011-11-28T01:45:20  <a1k0n> i don't... have.. path information or target locations
2011-11-28T01:45:32  <BenJackson> I think a lot of people are doing that (or similarly "collaborative diffusion")
2011-11-28T01:45:36  <BenJackson> because it leads to some observable macro behavior
2011-11-28T01:45:41  <antimatroid> 2 is easy, but with 1 how do you make sure the removed path information gets searched over properly with the remaining ants?
2011-11-28T01:45:46  <antimatroid> ah
2011-11-28T01:45:48  <antimatroid> nevermind then :P
2011-11-28T01:46:03  <a1k0n> my bot is the simplest thing that could possibly work
2011-11-28T01:46:30  <a1k0n> with a little bit of cleverness for exploration and random sampling for combat
2011-11-28T01:46:47  <a1k0n> i'm not really proud of my combat but it appears to do the job
2011-11-28T01:47:14  <antimatroid> i think generalised path finding was a terrible idea
2011-11-28T01:47:27  <antimatroid> i might just scratch that and go back to having path finding code all over the place
2011-11-28T01:48:04  <BenJackson> I hope the forums will still have interest in discussing strategies when the submission period ends
2011-11-28T01:48:11  <BenJackson> I'm tempted to pre-write some giant screeds to post on the day
2011-11-28T01:48:33  <antimatroid> interest is there for a few days then dies down fast in my experience
2011-11-28T01:48:38  <antimatroid> despite what many of us say before
2011-11-28T01:48:44  <a1k0n> heh.  well, definitely would be nice to blog that stuff afterwards
2011-11-28T01:48:54  <a1k0n> but i kinda miss the collaborative spirit from the tron contest forums
2011-11-28T01:49:01  <a1k0n> since then it's been kinda.. quiet.  competitive.

2011-11-28T01:50:38  <BenJackson> and what I did to get that far was sooo simple
2011-11-28T01:50:43  <BenJackson> I could explain it in a paragraph
2011-11-28T01:50:47  <antimatroid> although bits of information i calculate and use i like to keep secret
2011-11-28T01:50:59  <BenJackson> you can see people here talking about pathfinding and whatnot and they're so close

2011-11-28T01:51:15  <BenJackson> but then everything would just compress down

2011-11-28T02:56:19  <bhasker`> a1k0n how goes it
2011-11-28T02:56:46  <bhasker`> i have a question for you folks who are doing a multisource BFS for exploration
2011-11-28T02:56:59  <bhasker`> how do you extract the path afterwards?
2011-11-28T02:57:17  <pairofdice> My ants just follow the hill
2011-11-28T02:57:28  <thestinger> the enemy's hill is down :)
2011-11-28T02:58:41  <bhasker`> so let me get this right, lets say i am using it for exploration
2011-11-28T02:58:47  <bhasker`> i add all my ants as say sources
2011-11-28T02:58:52  <pairofdice> ie they look at the squares around them and pick the smallest/biggest number
2011-11-28T02:59:17  <bhasker`> hmm nm i think i know what i did wrong
2011-11-28T02:59:22  <thestinger> bhasker`: add the targets as sources
2011-11-28T02:59:45  <bhasker`> which would be all unexplored nodes?
2011-11-28T03:00:04  <Fluxid> 3http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1917 yay, my bot can create fronts, but enemy can break them too easily...
2011-11-28T03:00:34  <bhasker`> and use the ants as the targets for the BFS search?

2011-11-28T03:39:16  <bhasker`> okay got it working now, works nicely stinger
2011-11-28T03:39:24  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-28T03:39:34  <bhasker`> routes in a maze nicely too, though there are some issues where ants tend to
2011-11-28T03:39:36  <bhasker`> oscillate
2011-11-28T03:39:45  <bhasker`> if two paths give same number next to the ant
2011-11-28T03:40:32  <bhasker`> and its pretty fast as an exploration mechanism since doing the whole BFS
2011-11-28T03:40:35  <bhasker`> takes a couple of ms
2011-11-28T03:40:43  <bhasker`> then picking moves hardly takes anytime
2011-11-28T03:41:04  <bhasker`> i have like 4 different variations of exploration algorithms
2011-11-28T03:41:23  <bhasker`> if this works out well then its time to focus on the combat logic

2011-11-28T03:56:53  <bhasker`> tramp is pretty awesome except that stupid ctags lookup doesn't work well with tramp
2011-11-28T03:57:00  <bhasker`> so can't do a find-tag on a remote file
2011-11-28T03:57:42  <thestinger> clang does much nicer completion than ctags
2011-11-28T03:57:55  <thestinger> there's a plugin for vim, not sure about emacs but I'm sure something exists
2011-11-28T03:58:14  <bhasker`> hmm maybe i should try that

2011-11-28T03:58:45  <bhasker`> now to work on the combat logic
2011-11-28T03:59:48  <bhasker`> looks like there is a mode for emacs https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/utils/clang-completion-mode.el

2011-11-28T04:00:24  <thestinger> without saving the file/generating tags or whatever
2011-11-28T04:00:31  <thestinger> it pipes it into clang I guess
2011-11-28T04:00:45  <bhasker`> yea
2011-11-28T04:01:10  <bhasker`> i am using cedet which works reasonably well
2011-11-28T04:01:13  <bhasker`> but is kinda slow right now
2011-11-28T04:01:28  <thestinger> clang completion is very fast after the headers are cached
2011-11-28T04:01:32  <thestinger> like for standard lib stuff
2011-11-28T04:01:36  <bhasker`> yea will try that out
2011-11-28T04:02:04  <thestinger> I don't notice it taking any time except when I do something like vec.p<TAB> since I first opened the first

2011-11-28T04:02:56  <bhasker`> hey andy
2011-11-28T04:03:08  <bhasker`> my exploration AI is working but my defense and combat is broken
2011-11-28T04:03:09  <bhasker`> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/malazanAnt
2011-11-28T04:03:22  <bhasker`> the bot can't defend its hill for peanuts:(
2011-11-28T04:03:32  <a1k0n> i need to add hill defense now
2011-11-28T04:03:54  <thestinger> static defense or just blocking enemy ants from taking the hill?
2011-11-28T04:04:09  <a1k0n> my bot doesn't so much defend the hill as it does kill ants
2011-11-28T04:04:13  <thestinger> ah
2011-11-28T04:04:27  <a1k0n> it has very minimal awareness of hill defense
2011-11-28T04:04:29  <thestinger> my combat branch is basically incapable of killing ants atm due to some bug :P
2011-11-28T04:04:30  <a1k0n> need to fix that
2011-11-28T04:04:39  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1996
2011-11-28T04:05:14  <thestinger> I just block the paths to my hills basically
2011-11-28T04:05:32  <bhasker`> nice defense
2011-11-28T04:05:34  <thestinger> using 3x the number of enemies atm because I did it when I had no combat at all :)
2011-11-28T04:05:44  <a1k0n> this is not the hill i'm looking for
2011-11-28T04:05:49  <thestinger> once I finally get combat working, I'll reduce that to ~1.5x or something
2011-11-28T04:05:54  <a1k0n> hey that works pretty well
2011-11-28T04:06:04  <a1k0n> except it doesn't leave enough ants for offense
2011-11-28T04:06:09  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-28T04:06:26  <thestinger> jedimindtricks is my combat branch
2011-11-28T04:06:34  <thestinger> once it works, I'll reduce the # of defenders used a lot
2011-11-28T04:06:42  <thestinger> right now I really need that many ants or I'll lose my hill
2011-11-28T04:07:04  <a1k0n> my bots are not fighting each other on fluxid
2011-11-28T04:07:56  <thestinger> you probably started them at different times
2011-11-28T04:08:04  <thestinger> so they'll never fight each other until one gets eliminated early
2011-11-28T04:08:19  <thestinger> you just fight the same bots over and over xD
2011-11-28T04:08:24  <a1k0n> i just started one up, and it happened to get matched against the other which has been running forever
2011-11-28T04:08:45  <a1k0n> ok, time for bed
2011-11-28T04:08:49  <oelewapperke> I wonder what would happen if you would sweep hallways with vertical or horizontal rows of ants
2011-11-28T04:10:14  <bhasker`> will just get destroyed by a similar configuration?
2011-11-28T04:10:21  <bhasker`> and neutralized
2011-11-28T04:11:08  <thestinger> some of my variables really have silly names atm...
2011-11-28T04:11:17  <thestinger> something, longer_something, longest_something
2011-11-28T04:11:23  <thestinger> now I want to add something even longer
2011-11-28T04:11:28  <thestinger> longerestest_something?
2011-11-28T04:11:56  <bhasker`> i would rename all of them to be
2011-11-28T04:12:03  <bhasker`> i,ii,iii,iiii
2011-11-28T04:12:09  <bhasker`> at least save on typing
2011-11-28T04:12:12  <thestinger> lol, I'll just stick them in an array
2011-11-28T04:12:39  <thestinger> but I've ended up with some weird names due to refactoring and merging in branches
2011-11-28T04:13:07  <bhasker`> i am not branching at all hmm maybe i will once i have a decent working bot
2011-11-28T04:13:17  <bhasker`> the current one is too crappy especially combat wise
2011-11-28T04:13:20  <thestinger> and I still haven't changed the starter bot var names
2011-11-28T04:13:32  <thestinger> I like the python naming conventions, even in C++
2011-11-28T04:14:12  <bhasker`> they should lower the game turn cutoff to like 750 on the beta server
2011-11-28T04:14:13  <bhasker`> or something
2011-11-28T04:14:19  <bhasker`> heck even 500
2011-11-28T04:14:21  <bhasker`> faster games
2011-11-28T04:14:42  <bhasker`> on the tcp server i.e
2011-11-28T04:14:51  <thestinger> tcp just needs lower turntime
2011-11-28T04:15:04  <bhasker`> no that won't work
2011-11-28T04:15:05  <thestinger> some bots take all of the 5 seconds you get :\
2011-11-28T04:15:10  <bhasker`> not everyone has a good connection to the tcp
2011-11-28T04:15:14  <thestinger> well
2011-11-28T04:15:22  <thestinger> it just needs to tell them the turntime is 500ms
2011-11-28T04:16:01  <thestinger> it can still add 1s or whatever for network latency
2011-11-28T04:16:17  <thestinger> atm it just says turntime is 5s
2011-11-28T04:16:37  <thestinger> if I actually use 4900ms, I'll time out
2011-11-28T04:16:52  <thestinger> but I could be using ~4.3s per turn without timing out
2011-11-28T04:16:56  <antimatroid> ffffffff
2011-11-28T04:17:12  <thestinger> antimatroid: what? :P

2011-11-28T04:21:47  <antimatroid> that was my fff :P
2011-11-28T04:21:50  <thestinger> is it assumed that both food are visible?
2011-11-28T04:21:54  <antimatroid> yes
2011-11-28T04:22:24  <antimatroid> what i do is simultaneous bfs's from all ants and remove targets when i move an ant (and stop searching from those ants moves when i pull them off the queue)
2011-11-28T04:23:00  <antimatroid> but that means for each unmoved ant that i move i have to consider moving all other unmoved ants into it's old "move into" search locations
2011-11-28T04:23:06  <antimatroid> otherwise you miss having a bot move into those
2011-11-28T04:23:33  <antimatroid> but you've already marked off the second 'a' moving into the first 'a' loc in 2 moves from bfs'ing to the first location
2011-11-28T04:23:43  <thestinger> I keep track of directions that would bring ants closer to targets
2011-11-28T04:23:44  <antimatroid> messyness :P
2011-11-28T04:24:00  <thestinger> then solve the collision mess later
2011-11-28T04:24:27  <antimatroid> what just revert all collision moves iteratively until none remain?
2011-11-28T04:24:46  <antimatroid> oh wait, i think i see
2011-11-28T04:24:49  <antimatroid> i can do that
2011-11-28T04:25:15  <antimatroid> then if a move pulled off the search queue is now a collision update the pathlength and set the search direction to 'X'
2011-11-28T04:25:16  <antimatroid> thanks :P
2011-11-28T04:25:42  <antimatroid> that's much less messy

2011-11-28T04:30:06  <BenJackson> maybe late tomorrow my bot will get some good matches
2011-11-28T04:30:30  <janzert> seriously? you're already in good matches
2011-11-28T04:30:45  <janzert> that last second place certainly looks legitimate

2011-11-28T04:34:44  <BenJackson> that game was partly decided by the 80th ranked bot and who he happened to be next to
2011-11-28T04:35:08  <BenJackson> seems like when my sigma was lower before even in the high player count games the places were grouped much tighter
2011-11-28T04:36:03  <janzert> might be a bit tighter, but still last 5 games have all been opponents ranked under 100
2011-11-28T04:36:04  <antimatroid> it's less likely for "stupid" bots to upset a "smarter" bot with ants i think
2011-11-28T04:36:19  <BenJackson> under 100 doesn't mean much
2011-11-28T04:36:41  <janzert> you're not likely to get much less of a range of opponents
2011-11-28T04:36:45  <antimatroid> lol, BenJackson you weren't around for tron were you?
2011-11-28T04:36:54  <BenJackson> no, sadly missed that one
2011-11-28T04:37:07  <antimatroid> opponent selection for that was random
2011-11-28T04:37:11  <antimatroid> like, just random
2011-11-28T04:37:14  <thestinger> ouch
2011-11-28T04:37:31  <janzert> yeah, you can thank that as part of the motivation for me to become an admin ;)
2011-11-28T04:37:46  <thestinger> was TrueSkill used in Tron?
2011-11-28T04:37:50  <thestinger> or something else
2011-11-28T04:37:51  <antimatroid> nope
2011-11-28T04:37:56  <janzert> no, just points at first
2011-11-28T04:37:57  <antimatroid> elo in the end maybe?
2011-11-28T04:38:02  <janzert> then bayeselo by the end
2011-11-28T04:39:09  <janzert> planetwars was bayeselo throughout and this one trueskill since we need the multiplayer capability and bayeselo has gotten too slow for the number of participants anyway

2011-11-28T04:47:36  <antimatroid1> do a bfs from each ant simultaneously with the one search queue, but allow each ant to search over where other ants search, then remove targets as you move each ant
2011-11-28T04:48:01  <antimatroid1> (and add in new searches if you want to reuse a moved ant)

2011-11-28T04:56:36  <Anilm3> yup

2011-11-28T04:56:58  <thestinger> https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/default.aspx <- that's a simpler overview
2011-11-28T04:57:28  <Anilm3> great, thanks very much
2011-11-28T04:58:44  <thestinger> Fluxid: wow, you get a really nice spread of ants
2011-11-28T05:01:03  <Fluxid> thestinger: i used yout idea ;P
2011-11-28T05:01:26  <Anilm3> you could share it with me :D
2011-11-28T05:02:09  <Fluxid> ants standing on a path make the path longer.
2011-11-28T05:02:44  <Anilm3> what do you mean longer?
2011-11-28T05:03:03  <thestinger> like it increases the distance that path would take
2011-11-28T05:03:12  <thestinger> implementing it depends on how you do pathfinding
2011-11-28T05:03:23  <Anilm3> I see

2011-11-28T05:05:11  <Fluxid> in my case one ant adds 0.3 to path length
2011-11-28T05:05:41  <thestinger> why 0.3?
2011-11-28T05:06:58  <Fluxid> http://paste.aichallenge.org/sq8OH/ here's test of +3
2011-11-28T05:07:06  <thestinger> I'm doing +2 now so an ant is equally likely to move sideways when it's behind an ant
2011-11-28T05:07:13  <Fluxid> dunno, i tested a bit and larger were too large
2011-11-28T05:07:42  <Fluxid> but i also add near ant.. i mean, even if path goes close to ant
2011-11-28T05:08:14  <Fluxid> under the ant it's 0.3, then 0.2 by it ant 0.1 one cell away

2011-11-28T05:09:22  <thestinger> that's what this does
2011-11-28T05:09:34  <thestinger> it prefers moving to a tile with more allies in attack range when there are two with the same distance

2011-11-28T05:10:14  <Anilm3> hi
2011-11-28T05:10:33  <thestinger> it screws up combat though because they block each other
2011-11-28T05:10:46  <thestinger> luckily my master branch doesn't really do combat yet...
2011-11-28T05:14:12  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.2039 M produced lots of ants but it probably has problem with pathfinding and collides own ants..
2011-11-28T05:18:03  <thestinger> bots with single letter names are scary
2011-11-28T05:18:10  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.2028 goddamn, he timeouted and spawnkills my ants...
2011-11-28T05:18:26  <thestinger> lol, nice
2011-11-28T05:18:53  <antimatroid1> thestinger: you accidentally made my path finding code MUCH nicer :)
2011-11-28T05:19:09  <Fluxid> also lol, thestinger cool branch name

2011-11-28T05:20:52  <thestinger> jedimindtricks seemed like a good name for testing a bunch of random crap :)
2011-11-28T05:21:03  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.2000 i seriusly need to make my bot more aggresive...
2011-11-28T05:21:12  <Minthos> I give mine alphanumeric codes

2011-11-28T05:25:10  <magikmw> I have one major complaint. I don't know how to code stuff, I wish this contest would pop up somewhere around halfway next year so I could actually compete :f
2011-11-28T05:25:25  <antimatroid1> magikmw: this is the third contest :)
2011-11-28T05:25:28  <antimatroid1> there ought to be more
2011-11-28T05:26:42  <magikmw> I know. It's just that's the ants are awesome :p
2011-11-28T05:27:36  <magikmw> Right now I've finished the tutorial and my bots times out most of the time. I want to optimize it, but I have no real clue how. I know what pathfiding I want to do, still no idea how to implement it, frustrating :p
2011-11-28T05:27:55  <antimatroid1> which language are you using?
2011-11-28T05:28:05  <antimatroid1> the simplest pathfinding you can do is with breadth first search
2011-11-28T05:28:18  <antimatroid1> you can literally just do that with a search queue
2011-11-28T05:29:30  <magikmw> python
2011-11-28T05:29:57  <antimatroid1> yuk :P
2011-11-28T05:30:08  <magikmw> I know. I lack elementary knowledge however, and don't have much time to catch up.
2011-11-28T05:30:32  <antimatroid1> that's fine, we tried to make it so that the game would be good for beginners like yourself
2011-11-28T05:30:46  <antimatroid1> you may not be able to compete at the top but you should be able to have fun while learning a lot
2011-11-28T05:31:02  <magikmw> Oh it is good. I think I just need to sit and focus on this stuff.
2011-11-28T05:31:02  <antimatroid1> we aim for simplicity for beginners and depth for advanced programmers
2011-11-28T05:31:32  <magikmw> I tend to aim higher than I can reach, and get frustrated in the process.
2011-11-28T05:32:00  <antimatroid1> so do i, at least that way you can be somewhat satisfied with the outcome when you don't quite meet your expectations
2011-11-28T05:32:19  <magikmw> Right :]
2011-11-28T05:33:47  <sf17k> I learned a lot of OpenGL doing Ludum Dare
2011-11-28T05:34:09  <magikmw> I see that the main problem is timeouts, right now I'm using the tutorial suggested dictionaries for everything, but I know there are better ways of doing it. Also, cutting off not needed information would be a good thing if only the cutting wouldn't take up more time then it could save.
2011-11-28T05:34:18  <magikmw> This is all so complicated :p

2011-11-28T05:36:24  <Fluxid> oh wait
2011-11-28T05:36:34  <Fluxid> no, i was looking at ventipede

2011-11-28T05:36:47  <magikmw> I find it funny that the starting bot won more games then this timeout machine I have now.

2011-11-28T05:37:17  <magikmw> I have no timeleft checks too, but that's not going to help in a long run.
2011-11-28T05:37:33  <thestinger> ahhh collision bugs again :(
2011-11-28T05:37:34  <magikmw> If I can move 2 ants before breaking that's not a real play :p

2011-11-28T05:38:03  <antimatroid1> how do you do vision?
2011-11-28T05:38:07  <thestinger> I just copied the code from the java starter
2011-11-28T05:38:17  <thestinger> so, I make a vector of attack offsets
2011-11-28T05:38:20  <antimatroid1> i just calculate translation values for the view radius in turn 0 and stamp each ant locations visibility
2011-11-28T05:38:22  <thestinger> well
2011-11-28T05:38:29  <magikmw> Well, I saw a python+numpy starter bot on the forums that seems to do some stuff faster/better, I might look into that.
2011-11-28T05:38:37  <thestinger> antimatroid1: yeah, it does that
2011-11-28T05:38:50  <magikmw> I'm not really interested in learing 3 languages at one time, so I'll stick with python.
2011-11-28T05:38:54  <thestinger> but I also do it for attackradius, attackradius+1, attackradius+2 for enemies/allies
2011-11-28T05:39:03  <antimatroid1> i have another function to bomb vision information with water infomation blocking when collecting unseen squares
2011-11-28T05:39:15  <antimatroid1> i don't like your attackRadius+1/2 stuff :P
2011-11-28T05:39:21  <thestinger> neither do I
2011-11-28T05:39:29  <antimatroid1> you ignore that a..%b can't land in a battle
2011-11-28T05:39:52  <thestinger> yeah, that's a problem
2011-11-28T05:39:52  <antimatroid1> or a%..b
2011-11-28T05:40:04  <antimatroid1> i found it's worth noting both those instances when working out how to partition them
2011-11-28T05:40:44  <antimatroid1> ie. you can't just search in the battle radius off movable locations of a or (but not both) b
2011-11-28T05:41:08  <magikmw> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=138648&user=12500
2011-11-28T05:41:29  <magikmw> Huh, if I had some pathfinding I would dominate this game :p
2011-11-28T05:42:14  <antimatroid1> thestinger: what i do is mark which locations an ant can move in then for each ant i add to a battle partition i add the enemies it could find in the attack radius of each of its neighbours
2011-11-28T05:42:15  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.2072 i got into a crossfire :(
2011-11-28T05:42:21  <antimatroid1> possibly not exactly like that, but equivalently to that
2011-11-28T05:42:53  <thestinger> Fluxid: ouch
2011-11-28T05:43:16  <antimatroid1> of course it's not a battle partition unless it ends up containing friendly ants and enemy ants, so i make the parititon starting with each unused friendly ant and make moves if there are enemies in the partition
2011-11-28T05:43:41  <thestinger> Fluxid: my ants intentionally helped red kill you
2011-11-28T05:44:05  <thestinger> enemies killing other enemies counts as score++ for some reason...
2011-11-28T05:44:29  <antimatroid1> if(enemy == Fluxid) zorg_rush(Fluxid);
2011-11-28T05:44:37  <thestinger> so I think my ants sacrificed themselves to help red
2011-11-28T05:45:21  <magikmw> I think I should just implement writing HL GF with ants first.

2011-11-28T06:23:35  <Garf> if your ant dies, does it still see the enemy ants in the turn where it died?
2011-11-28T06:23:55  <Garf> i.e. is it 1) battle 2) vision, or the reverse?
2011-11-28T06:25:17  <thestinger> I think it's just 1) ants spawn -> you get turn info -> 2) ants move 3) battle 4) end of turn
2011-11-28T06:27:36  <antimatroid1> Garf: no
2011-11-28T06:27:50  <antimatroid1> you don't even get told if one of your ants dies if it's outside view of your currently live ants
2011-11-28T06:28:37  <antimatroid1> although you can check that by seeing if you expected an ant to exist somewhere and it's no longer in view of the ants you were told are alive
2011-11-28T06:29:12  <Garf> an ant can see itself, so I can check if anything is at the location it was ordered to
2011-11-28T06:31:19  <Garf> however, in a 1-1 ant battle, an ant can't post-facto see that it also killed the opponent
2011-11-28T06:31:41  <thestinger> you do get dead ant info
2011-11-28T06:31:50  <thestinger> ants that died in the last turn in tiles you can see
2011-11-28T06:32:13  <Garf> in a 1-1 battle, there might not be neighbouring ants that can see the dead one
2011-11-28T06:32:39  <Fluxid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.2084 holy fuck
2011-11-28T06:33:02  <thestinger> so many ants
2011-11-28T06:33:38  <thestinger> oh... found the collision bug
2011-11-28T06:33:43  <thestinger> really stupid mistake...
2011-11-28T06:37:14  <thestinger> that was probably able to cause a crash too

2011-11-28T08:51:23  <olexs> thestinger: isn't that bfs too? at least my bot is very loosely based on an old java starter, and I use bfs for visibility
2011-11-28T08:51:50  <thestinger> well, the old starter packages used a crappier way of doing it
2011-11-28T08:52:06  <thestinger> the C++ one still uses a BFS for visibility
2011-11-28T08:53:05  <olexs> the vis check takes about 1ms average when playing on tcp from my machine, I'd consider that fast enough

2011-11-28T08:53:41  <olexs> would not matter much, it's still just one search used
2011-11-28T08:54:34  <olexs> the average I just took from a game log, at the end I had 138 ants...

2011-11-28T08:55:21  <thestinger> it starts off fast but it scales with the number of ants

2011-11-28T08:57:12  <thestinger> do you use a BFS to find nearby ants for the battle sims?
2011-11-28T08:57:27  <olexs> yes, but that's not the slow part
2011-11-28T08:57:53  <olexs> slow part is the game tree getting built and evaluated
2011-11-28T08:58:42  <olexs> still, in 500ms on my machine, avg search depth is 7 to 10 plies from game to game, which I'm rather happy with
2011-11-28T09:00:57  <thestinger> how can you look that far ahead? what about ants you can't see moving into combat?
2011-11-28T09:02:11  <olexs> those are currently ignored. but it works rather well, I think

2011-11-28T11:18:23  <roflmao> yeah submit dude
2011-11-28T11:18:25  <roflmao> you can always resubmit
2011-11-28T11:18:28  <roflmao> also -- are you familiar with tcp?
2011-11-28T11:18:50  <Ruuhkis> I am familiar with TCP but not with the TCP server used to test bots :D
2011-11-28T11:18:56  <roflmao> ah
2011-11-28T11:18:57  <roflmao> use it
2011-11-28T11:18:59  <roflmao> ants.fluxid.pl
2011-11-28T11:19:11  <roflmao> ants are way harder there but you really wont get good unless you can try out your bot against harder ones
2011-11-28T11:19:15  <roflmao> and have a decent stream of game
2011-11-28T11:19:28  <roflmao> the starter pack hunterbots and leftybot are practically useless for any sort of serious testing
2011-11-28T11:19:36  <Ruuhkis> I'd like first beat the example bots ;)
2011-11-28T11:19:40  <roflmao> also, you are familiar with the --scenario flag, right?
2011-11-28T11:19:46  <Ruuhkis> that greedy rusher is pwning me
2011-11-28T11:19:54  <Fluxid> uh
2011-11-28T11:19:58  <Fluxid> that's bad ;)
2011-11-28T11:20:20  <Ruuhkis> I know, I know, I am making my ants defense base after i got into it
2011-11-28T11:20:22  <Ruuhkis> wont be static, dont worry
2011-11-28T11:20:54  <g0llum> Ruuhkis, attack is the better defense
2011-11-28T11:21:00  <ikaros> HoldBot is great for testing exploration :)
2011-11-28T11:22:04  <Ruuhkis> oh
2011-11-28T11:22:15  <Ruuhkis> I'll try it :3 wanna give tips with exploring
2011-11-28T11:22:23  <roflmao> sure
2011-11-28T11:22:31  <roflmao> a basic exploration function is using a bfs map from all unseen tiles
2011-11-28T11:22:36  <Ruuhkis> should i add just northest, eastest... visited tile as variable and go thru nearest farrest visited tile :D
2011-11-28T11:23:04  <Ruuhkis> my bot is so far trying to go most unvisited tile next to it

2011-11-28T11:23:29  <Ruuhkis> but with the tutorial map its still staying on its own side
2011-11-28T11:23:37  <roflmao> well
2011-11-28T11:23:39  <roflmao> make it unseen tile
2011-11-28T11:23:49  <roflmao> you can later on add tiles that you haven't visited in quite a while
2011-11-28T11:24:00  <Antimony> Wow, my bot has been elimnated with a score of 0 in ten consecutive tcp games now
2011-11-28T11:24:05  <roflmao> but you want to explore the map -- in other words reduce the number of unseen tiles
2011-11-28T11:24:30  <roflmao> so bfs moving to unseen tiles is a good first way to accomplishing uit
2011-11-28T11:24:47  <roflmao> it doesn't really "spread" out your ants sufficiently (they all go after the same unseen tiles it appears)
2011-11-28T11:24:51  <roflmao> but you can hack/fix that
2011-11-28T11:25:10  <Ruuhkis> oh, i see
2011-11-28T11:25:16  <Ruuhkis> so i make explorers go towars unseen tiles :3
2011-11-28T11:25:23  <roflmao> yeah that's a good starting point
2011-11-28T11:25:33  <roflmao> that should be good enough for quite a bit until you get some of the other stuff up
2011-11-28T11:25:42  <roflmao> you do have a bfs function right?
2011-11-28T11:26:03  <Ruuhkis> I am only familiar with a* but I know bfs wud be much better in this case

2011-11-28T11:27:33  <Antimony> Wtf! MY ants are braindeadhttp://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.2533
2011-11-28T11:27:35  <roflmao> bfs is basically a* with like 3 differences
2011-11-28T11:27:41  <Antimony> They don't collect food
2011-11-28T11:27:48  <roflmao> 1. the open set is sorted by first-in-first-out not a heuristic
2011-11-28T11:28:06  <roflmao> 2. there is no heuristic for the cost at all, just the g_score
2011-11-28T11:28:25  <roflmao> 3. you don't terminate the bfs once you get your target, it is exhaustive, so you let it run until the open_set is completely dry
2011-11-28T11:28:51  <roflmao> antimony: why did you skip the food?
2011-11-28T11:29:01  <Antimony> I don't know!
2011-11-28T11:29:15  <roflmao> :P
2011-11-28T11:29:52  <Ruuhkis> So I could also use a*? :)
2011-11-28T11:29:56  <Ruuhkis> I really like it lol
2011-11-28T11:30:23  <ikaros> Ruuhkis, it depends what you are aiming at. bfs can be used for multiple targets/sources
2011-11-28T11:31:16  <Ruuhkis> oh, so if I had a squad attacking.. :)
2011-11-28T11:31:16  <roflmao> Ruuhkis: err well you can "use" it but yeah as ikaros says, it depends on what you're doing
2011-11-28T11:31:28  <roflmao> if you're looking for GENERAL pathfinding that all your ants use, a* is way worse than BFS
2011-11-28T11:31:42  <ikaros> if you want a single ant go to a specific tile a* would probably be better
2011-11-28T11:31:43  <roflmao> because a* is strictly one  to one
2011-11-28T11:31:44  <roflmao> yeah
2011-11-28T11:31:54  <roflmao> but for moving all hundreds of your ants towards enemy hills, unseen tiles, food, etc
2011-11-28T11:31:59  <roflmao> bfs is better
2011-11-28T11:32:07  <g0llum> a* is a 1 on 1 only, while bfs can bbe a 1 on many
2011-11-28T11:32:12  <ikaros> but so far i use bfs for everything and i dont have speed issues

2011-11-28T11:32:33  <Ruuhkis> Thanks :P I need to find good source to get in bfs
2011-11-28T11:32:46  <ikaros> wikipedia
2011-11-28T11:32:49  <ikaros> its dead simple
2011-11-28T11:33:04  <delt0r_> breath first search is dead easy...
2011-11-28T11:33:08  <ikaros> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search
2011-11-28T11:33:39  <delt0r_> one of the first things i teach students... depth first, breath first... recursion and turning recursion into a loop
2011-11-28T11:33:41  <g0llum> yeah, take a long deep breath first..
2011-11-28T11:34:45  <roflmao> its kind of ironic how many people are more familiar with a* than bfs
2011-11-28T11:34:56  <roflmao> since a* is really just a bfs spinoff that's ctually more complicated
2011-11-28T11:35:21  <Antimony> roflmao I figured out the problem
2011-11-28T11:35:26  <roflmao> yeah>
2011-11-28T11:35:27  <roflmao> ?
2011-11-28T11:35:37  <Antimony> I set it to prefer hills over food when the turn is high
2011-11-28T11:35:46  <Antimony> but I accidently used maxturns instead of current turn
2011-11-28T11:35:53  <Antimony> so it always prefers hills
2011-11-28T11:35:53  <roflmao> oh lol
2011-11-28T11:35:56  <roflmao> dude
2011-11-28T11:36:04  <roflmao> that fix right there is going to really make a huge difference
2011-11-28T11:36:13  <Antimony> IT only goes to food if the closest hill is more than 37 away
2011-11-28T11:36:42  <ikaros> :))
2011-11-28T11:37:12  <roflmao> each time i change my bot i seem to make it worse

2011-11-28T11:37:37  <Antimony> Wow, such a stupid mistake. Using state.turns instead of state.turn
2011-11-28T11:38:07  <roflmao> easy to make
2011-11-28T11:38:43  <Antimony> ok time to test the fixed version
2011-11-28T11:38:51  <roflmao> :D

2011-11-28T11:42:19  <roflmao> yeah?
2011-11-28T11:42:24  <Antimony> Well, I don't do any pathfinding from ants to targets
2011-11-28T11:42:31  <Antimony> I pathfind from targets to ants
2011-11-28T11:42:37  <Ruuhkis> hmm
2011-11-28T11:42:37  <Ruuhkis> HMM
2011-11-28T11:42:45  <Antimony> it's much more efficient
2011-11-28T11:42:49  <Minthos> I do both
2011-11-28T11:42:54  <rwest> I do neither
2011-11-28T11:43:05  <rwest> I read that thread on diffusion
2011-11-28T11:43:17  <g0llum> rwest, instead ?
2011-11-28T11:43:21  <Ruuhkis> is there better pseudocode example around than on wikipedia?
2011-11-28T11:43:44  <rwest> g0llum: I score the map, and just move each ant to the highest scoring tile adjacent them
2011-11-28T11:43:53  <roflmao> that's pathfinding
2011-11-28T11:43:56  <roflmao> :P
2011-11-28T11:44:00  <roflmao> just a bfs style pathfinding
2011-11-28T11:44:06  <g0llum> yea
2011-11-28T11:44:14  <roflmao> we pretty much all do it that way afaik
2011-11-28T11:44:52  <roflmao> g0llum: my theory is that this game works on an emergent order
2011-11-28T11:44:56  <Ruuhkis> rwest, I do the same but i do it just around interesting things :o
2011-11-28T11:45:09  <roflmao> g0llum: the reason most changes you make fuctor your bot is because you're adding complexity to it
2011-11-28T11:45:10  <g0llum> *conspiracy*
2011-11-28T11:45:15  <rwest> Ruuhkis: yes, I score objects on the map, then diffuse the values
2011-11-28T11:45:41  <roflmao> g0llum: the extra complexity sounds good on paper, but your theory doesn't consider the dozens of extra variables you're not aware of that happen in the real battle
2011-11-28T11:45:47  <rwest> Ruuhkis: no need to figure out how to get to the goal
2011-11-28T11:45:58  <roflmao> g0llum: the more complexity added, the more places your ant can break at and the more "special cases" required
2011-11-28T11:46:08  <g0llum> roflmao, i'm a victim to that, too.
2011-11-28T11:46:15  <Ruuhkis> rwest right, but I am stuck on exploring the map.. :D
2011-11-28T11:46:17  <roflmao> that's why some of the top bots have a dead simple system but they just got the right one
2011-11-28T11:46:43  <Ruuhkis> what would be the best way to find closest unseen tile direction? just loop till find?
2011-11-28T11:46:48  <rwest> Ruuhkis: I think I have figured that out, I keep a separate scoring for explore
2011-11-28T11:46:58  <roflmao> Ruukhis: BFS-map is the best way:)
2011-11-28T11:47:01  <rwest> and I increment that map all unseen tiles per turn
2011-11-28T11:47:06  <rwest> and if tile is visible
2011-11-28T11:47:07  <rwest> I 0 it
2011-11-28T11:47:13  <rwest> then I use that as a multiplier
2011-11-28T11:47:20  <rwest> to score the tiles for exploration
2011-11-28T11:47:30  <roflmao> interesting way of doing it rwest
2011-11-28T11:47:32  <roflmao> does it work>
2011-11-28T11:47:40  <rwest> so tiles I haven't seen in a long time are scored higher
2011-11-28T11:48:15  <rwest> roflmao: http://tcpants.com/replay.9835
2011-11-28T11:48:21  <rwest> rossxwest is me
2011-11-28T11:48:27  <rwest> and yes he still beats me every game
2011-11-28T11:48:28  <rwest> hah
2011-11-28T11:48:39  <roflmao> :) idea
2011-11-28T11:48:47  <roflmao> why don't you have a min cap on the multipleir
2011-11-28T11:48:52  <roflmao> so your ants dont go in circles
2011-11-28T11:48:59  <roflmao> or do that jittery back and forth move
2011-11-28T11:49:10  <roflmao> only consider the multiplier if the last seen turn is above a certain threshold
2011-11-28T11:49:13  <roflmao> say -- 10 turns

2011-11-28T12:14:43  <olexs1> basically I'd need to sort them along the line and then take the median... hm

2011-11-28T15:25:33  <rwest> just took 30 minutes to play one match on fluxid :-/
2011-11-28T15:26:21  <olexs1> fluxid is quite slow... tcpants is faster, but no cell maze maps
2011-11-28T15:26:23  <Antimony> I hate it when that happens
2011-11-28T15:26:34  <Antimony> the time depends on how fast the bots are and how long it lasts
2011-11-28T15:26:37  <Antimony> sometimes games are fast
2011-11-28T15:26:54  <olexs1> but mostly some bots decides it will use at least 1s per move
2011-11-28T15:27:04  <Antimony> A 1500 move game at 5 secons per move is quite slow
2011-11-28T15:27:08  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-28T15:27:29  <olexs1> I put a hard upper limit of 1000ms in mine, even if server specifies more
2011-11-28T15:27:42  <Fluxid> thestinger: you there?
2011-11-28T15:27:47  <Antimony> I have my bot set to use at most 465ms on combat and movement, but it might spend more time doing otehr stuff
2011-11-28T15:28:15  <rwest> I don't even know how long mines takes
2011-11-28T15:28:23  <rwest> but it doesn't timeout on the official servers
2011-11-28T15:28:56  <rwest> do I gotta add code to time it or is there a flag to see it while running a game?
2011-11-28T15:29:22  <olexs1> you need your own code
2011-11-28T15:29:50  <rwest> eh, I think I am fine, my running time is based on map dimensions
2011-11-28T15:31:16  <olexs1> ok... now I see if the new exploration code is as good as I hope it is

2011-11-28T15:40:31  <McLeopold> no
2011-11-28T15:40:37  <McLeopold> too much data to capture

2011-11-28T15:41:15  <McLeopold> not to me as an admin :)
2011-11-28T15:42:18  <McLeopold> hmm, the visualizer has a bug
2011-11-28T15:43:35  <janzert> McLeopold: I think I have some time now
2011-11-28T15:43:38  <McLeopold> ok
2011-11-28T15:45:35  <McLeopold> janzert: hmm, ietherpad is down :(
2011-11-28T15:45:48  <janzert> what do you think about a 25,000 maximum total area and 8,000 per player max?
2011-11-28T15:46:01  <janzert> :(
2011-11-28T15:46:16  <McLeopold> sounds good, I was thinking maybe 900-5,000 per player, which is lower
2011-11-28T15:46:33  <janzert> ok
2011-11-28T15:47:00  <McLeopold> large 2 player maps look nice, but don't really gain us anything in determining better bots
2011-11-28T15:47:09  <janzert> yeah
2011-11-28T15:47:25  <McLeopold> 25,000 max is good
2011-11-28T15:47:38  <janzert> just not really sure where the useful maximum is, 5000 works for me just as well as 8000
2011-11-28T15:47:39  <McLeopold> 200 max for either dimension as well
2011-11-28T15:47:44  <janzert> right
2011-11-28T15:48:54  <McLeopold> well, I figure 5000area per player is about 70^2, so players have about 70 turns max before hitting opponents
2011-11-28T15:49:10  <janzert> in an open map
2011-11-28T15:49:12  <McLeopold> ~90 with 8000
2011-11-28T15:49:12  * janzert nods
2011-11-28T15:49:19  <janzert> yep
2011-11-28T15:50:02  <McLeopold> the cutoff is at 150 turns ,so I was thinking about half that for an open map to ensure competition, plus we can blame bots for not gathering food
2011-11-28T15:50:03  <janzert> the 25000 max was to get roughly the 150x150 max I used for the initial maps
2011-11-28T15:50:23  <janzert> yeah, that sounds reasonable
2011-11-28T15:50:38  <McLeopold> okay, then hill distances, what should we do?
2011-11-28T15:50:53  <McLeopold> I would like to keep initial hills out of site
2011-11-28T15:51:04  <janzert> I'm thinking more like 175 maybe even 150 maximum distance
2011-11-28T15:51:12  <janzert> what for?
2011-11-28T15:51:26  <McLeopold> I don't have a good reason :)
2011-11-28T15:51:39  <McLeopold> other than to make an "opening move" not be forced
2011-11-28T15:51:55  <janzert> I thought allowing them in site but long distance travel could show interesting bad behavior by some bots
2011-11-28T15:52:07  <McLeopold> it does
2011-11-28T15:52:15  <janzert> well minimum travel distance should be not within site
2011-11-28T15:52:24  <McLeopold> no, we agree there
2011-11-28T15:52:29  <janzert> i.e. if in site there has to be a wall in between
2011-11-28T15:52:34  <janzert> sight rather
2011-11-28T15:52:48  <McLeopold> okay, but not with attack distance
2011-11-28T15:52:53  <janzert> yeah, for sure
2011-11-28T15:53:06  <McLeopold> I'd like the 8 squares around the hill to be out of attack distance as well
2011-11-28T15:53:46  <janzert> yep
2011-11-28T15:53:48  <janzert> sounds good
2011-11-28T15:54:10  <McLeopold> so, they have to be at least 5 squares away
2011-11-28T15:54:25  <McLeopold> I'd like to up the min path distance to about 36
2011-11-28T15:54:45  <McLeopold> less than 200 max distance is tough to get good maze maps

2011-11-28T15:54:57  <McLeopold> but the lower area requirement might fix that
2011-11-28T15:55:17  <janzert> 5 distance by eucilidian, does 36 by travel have reasoning behind it?
2011-11-28T15:55:41  <janzert> I was thinking maybe 20 but no real reason other than a little more than twice vision
2011-11-28T15:55:45  <McLeopold> 36 turns, half the ~70 for max area
2011-11-28T15:55:50  <McLeopold> ish
2011-11-28T15:56:31  <McLeopold> it was to even out the hill distances
2011-11-28T15:56:45  <McLeopold> so, in this map _> .a.b.c.d
2011-11-28T15:57:02  <McLeopold> a is 2 away from b and d, and 4 away from c

2011-11-28T15:57:19  <McLeopold> getting all opponents closer is more fair
2011-11-28T15:57:48  <McLeopold> I think I had a check that the max distance for a bot needed to be within 150% of the min distance
2011-11-28T15:57:55  <janzert> hmm, it still seems a little high to me but I don't mind too much
2011-11-28T15:58:15  <janzert> that seems hard to do with high player maps
2011-11-28T15:58:30  <janzert> I don't think I'd want to formalize that
2011-11-28T15:59:03  <McLeopold> ok, I'll just put some checks in cell_maze only
2011-11-28T15:59:19  <janzert> ok
2011-11-28T15:59:28  <McLeopold> it becomes more complicated with multi-hills
2011-11-28T15:59:34  <janzert> seems like it makes a true maze even harder to accomplish as well
2011-11-28T15:59:42  <McLeopold> it does
2011-11-28T16:00:23  <janzert> are you planning to extend cell maze to multi hill?
2011-11-28T16:00:23  <McLeopold> 150 max will make mazes hard as well
2011-11-28T16:00:29  <McLeopold> yes
2011-11-28T16:00:36  <janzert> great
2011-11-28T16:00:43  <McLeopold> I just needed a more formal hill distance check
2011-11-28T16:01:22  <janzert> how about 180 max travel then?
2011-11-28T16:01:27  <McLeopold> I'd like to say that the opponent to opponent max is 150
2011-11-28T16:02:14  <janzert> go up to 165 would be 6 trips in a 1000 turn game
2011-11-28T16:02:39  <janzert> 150 is still 6.6
2011-11-28T16:03:51  <McLeopold> Let me give you some stats on that from some mazes, then we can decide, but it will be somewhere between 150-200

2011-11-28T16:22:47  <McLeopold> 66% must be traversable, including all hills
2011-11-28T16:23:02  <McLeopold> 33% can be traversable by only a single ant
2011-11-28T16:23:15  <janzert> I just meant if you wanted to change the wording of the spec I'd go for the above
2011-11-28T16:23:19  <McLeopold> ok
2011-11-28T16:23:35  <BenJackson_> janzert: I guess I was just confused by the javascript replay
2011-11-28T16:23:44  <janzert> since that is one of the points that still says details being worked on
2011-11-28T16:23:48  <BenJackson_> if you right click on it you're prompted to "view image" so I thought the front page wasn't using the visualizer
2011-11-28T16:23:51  <BenJackson_> but they all do that
2011-11-28T16:23:55  <janzert> BenJackson: ahh yeah
2011-11-28T16:24:01  <janzert> frontpage is still the visualizer
2011-11-28T16:24:05  <janzert> just without the buttons
2011-11-28T16:24:12  <McLeopold> janzert: I'll finalize that point after I get the map gens going through the main class
2011-11-28T16:24:12  <BenJackson_> janzert: you should have a special hill rule
2011-11-28T16:24:20  <BenJackson_> I think at least one map now has a perfectly defensible hill
2011-11-28T16:24:25  <McLeopold> I don't yet know how the other map types will do against those checks
2011-11-28T16:24:46  <janzert> BenJackson: the initial maps didn't follow basically any of these

2011-11-28T16:27:37  <Antimony> so do we put it on Gitbhub, or email it, or what?
2011-11-28T16:27:55  <McLeopold> fork the aichallenge repo on github and issue a pull request
2011-11-28T16:28:01  <Antimony> oh ok
2011-11-28T16:28:02  <McLeopold> do you code in python?
2011-11-28T16:28:09  <Antimony> I've doen some PYthon
2011-11-28T16:28:13  <Antimony> I'm not a big expert on it
2011-11-28T16:28:34  <Antimony> Can we use numpy?
2011-11-28T16:28:52  <McLeopold> yes, but I'm not sure if it will gain you anything
2011-11-28T16:29:33  <Antimony> I suppose the map generator doesn't have to be super optimized
2011-11-28T16:29:46  <Antimony> Since it isn't run often
2011-11-28T16:29:55  <McLeopold> I did some matrix tests with numpy and tuple lookup was slower than lists

2011-11-28T16:31:28  <Antimony> by the way, did you look at the C++ timer I submitted?

2011-11-28T17:06:35  <pairofdice> two snakes is better than one
2011-11-28T17:06:37  <a1k0n> the better i make my bot, the worse it is
2011-11-28T17:07:21  <BenJackson_> a1k0n: worse it appears I've overspecialized or something because my bot is floundering on the official site
2011-11-28T17:07:41  <a1k0n> uh oh
2011-11-28T17:07:47  <besh> a1kon: It takes a lot of testing to tell if a version is better especially with multi players.
2011-11-28T17:08:05  <a1k0n> yeah.  i have a succession of bots which absolutely destroy their predecessors on a 1v1
2011-11-28T17:08:13  <a1k0n> but against everyone else are successively worse
2011-11-28T17:08:52  <a1k0n> then again, it might just be biases resulting from who they're playing against lately

2011-11-28T17:14:42  <jstrong> a1k0n: I've noticed map placement REALLY matters against same version of your old bot
2011-11-28T17:14:46  <jstrong> if my new bot destroys my old bot
2011-11-28T17:14:50  <jstrong> i switch around the locations and try again
2011-11-28T17:14:59  <jstrong> I know the map is symmetrical technically
2011-11-28T17:15:10  <a1k0n> yes i have to try it both ways
2011-11-28T17:15:11  <jstrong> but you might have some bug/pattern/etc of movement that favors a certain position over another
2011-11-28T17:15:29  <a1k0n> i'm definitely biased such that it fights better up/left than down/right
2011-11-28T17:15:54  <jstrong> cause of ordering of the directions whenever you loop through them?
2011-11-28T17:16:09  <a1k0n> no, it's a bit of a more complicated tradeoff i made
2011-11-28T17:17:42  <besh> I still haven't beaten old versions rating on the main server.. eventhough I fell I have improved it.

2011-11-28T17:28:55  <BenJackson_> there is some specific rule against throwing games and whatnot
2011-11-28T17:28:58  <BenJackson_> which I totally support
2011-11-28T17:29:04  <McLeopold> is there?
2011-11-28T17:29:29  <BenJackson_> rule 3
2011-11-28T17:29:55  <BenJackson_> what I was talking about earlier here is not in violation of the letter of that rule
2011-11-28T17:30:04  <McLeopold> this? manipulating rankings by intentionally losing games
2011-11-28T17:30:11  <BenJackson_> but perhaps the spirit
2011-11-28T17:30:25  <McLeopold> This is a multiplayer game, so cooperation is allowed
2011-11-28T17:30:34  <pairofdice> Spirit of competition? Knock their teeth out!
2011-11-28T17:30:37  <McLeopold> if bots can communicate and cooperate, that is allowed
2011-11-28T17:31:01  <BenJackson_> wow
2011-11-28T17:31:14  <McLeopold> so if 2 bots identify they are both losing, the can stop fighting each other and gang up on the leader
2011-11-28T17:31:27  <McLeopold> I actually expected more of that to happen, but it doesn't
2011-11-28T17:31:28  <BenJackson_> it would be funny to see two bots ID each other, agree to wipe off the opponents, then intentionally reset to some known state and have a fair fight
2011-11-28T17:31:56  <BenJackson_> I suppose I could post an open protocol
2011-11-28T17:32:01  <McLeopold> you should
2011-11-28T17:32:09  <BenJackson_> where I agree to make an arrow of ants pointing at an enemy base
2011-11-28T17:32:14  <BenJackson_> you can follow it or not
2011-11-28T17:32:17  <olexs1> what are thinking? move patterns?
2011-11-28T17:32:20  <McLeopold> I figured some type of dance in vision radius could be used
2011-11-28T17:32:32  <olexs1> "bee dance" type of thing...
2011-11-28T17:32:54  <BenJackson_> I suppose if I wanted people to adopt it what I should do is make up the protocol and post code that detects the patterns
2011-11-28T17:33:02  <janzert> the spirit of that rule is to stop you from intentionally boosting another bots rating; offhand lowering another bots rating seems the point of the contest ;)
2011-11-28T17:33:23  <BenJackson_> janzert: well in an n-way game they're inextricably linked

2011-11-28T17:42:10  <Fluxid> then tell me what is the time on tcpants
2011-11-28T17:42:16  <olexs1> the website is slow, but the games are much faster
2011-11-28T17:42:23  *** epicmonkey <epicmonkey!~epicmonke@178.130.5.103> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2011-11-28T17:42:37  <olexs1> Fluxid: can't tell for sure but I think it gives 1000ms timeout to bots
2011-11-28T17:43:05  <BenJackson_> fwiw despite the suggestion that TCP ants are better due to larger timeout, I don't use the timeout at all
2011-11-28T17:44:15  <Antimony> it looks to me like tcpants is also 5000 timeout
2011-11-28T17:44:30  <besh> Mine takes about 100ms to make a move on average.
2011-11-28T17:44:32  <janzert> it would be good if the tcp servers (or maybe even just the client script) were modified to send a lower timeout than the server is actually using
2011-11-28T17:44:48  <Antimony> why?
2011-11-28T17:44:51  <olexs1> but the fact remains: even though my ping to fluxid is much lower than to tcpants, in the time of one fluxid game I play 4-5 games in tcpants
2011-11-28T17:44:53  <Antimony> oh
2011-11-28T17:44:56  <Antimony> to prvent timeout
2011-11-28T17:45:01  <janzert> right
2011-11-28T17:45:06  <besh> But some bots seem to use all of it which significantly reduces the game rate.
2011-11-28T17:45:13  <Fluxid> turntime 5000
2011-11-28T17:45:15  <Fluxid> same
2011-11-28T17:45:19  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-28T17:45:33  <pairofdice> oh
2011-11-28T17:45:56  <Fluxid> damn, and i killed tcp server to lower the turntime
2011-11-28T17:45:58  <olexs1> +1 to janzert's idea. keep the server-side timeout at 5000 to prevent timeout due to network lag, but tell bots it's 1000 or even 500 to make them move faster
2011-11-28T17:46:04  <BenJackson_> there are some slow bots on fluxid
2011-11-28T17:46:07  <Fluxid> sorry, restard in a second
2011-11-28T17:46:11  <BenJackson_> if you get a game with one of those it takes forever
2011-11-28T17:46:20  <BenJackson_> I've seen games start where I have just 1 ant
2011-11-28T17:46:23  <Antimony> I wonder if I should set up my desktop to play tcp continously
2011-11-28T17:46:24  <BenJackson_> and I can see it going at 1 turn/sec
2011-11-28T17:46:32  <Antimony> so I don't have to kill it whenever I put my laptop away
2011-11-28T17:46:44  <Fluxid> restarted, still with the time 5000

2011-11-28T17:51:31  <Fluxid> my bot could be slow, i found some problems in code and it could take over 1.5s a turn...
2011-11-28T17:51:51  <janzert> last contest people were using git commit hashes to version their tcp bot with
2011-11-28T17:51:52  <Antimony> Anyway, I think that even having 1v1 combat would greatly improe my bot
2011-11-28T17:51:54  <Fluxid> now it takes around 150ms a turn
2011-11-28T17:52:01  <Antimony> shame there's no easy way for me to implement that
2011-11-28T17:52:28  <McLeopold> Antimony: how do you do 1v1 combat?  you both die or you both live
2011-11-28T17:52:34  <BenJackson_> Fluxid: one of those giant 200x200 cell maps was taking >500ms on my Q6600 at home
2011-11-28T17:52:42  <BenJackson_> so I had to profile and optimize some things
2011-11-28T17:52:42  <olexs1> janzert: I'm thinking of setting up an automated tcp playing system, that would check out all tagged commits, compile them and run them on tcp...
2011-11-28T17:52:57  <Fluxid> BenJackson_: oh, i have the same cpu here...
2011-11-28T17:53:11  <Fluxid> and it takes 200ms at most
2011-11-28T17:53:18  <Fluxid> (after optiimizations)
2011-11-28T17:53:40  <BenJackson_> my problem cases were for 200+ v 200+ ants on a big open cell map
2011-11-28T17:53:46  <BenJackson_> there were lots of "combats"
2011-11-28T17:53:50  <BenJackson_> in the amorphous snow of ants

2011-11-28T17:55:30  <BenJackson_> the process seems to be going but it might be spinning
2011-11-28T17:55:56  <besh> How do you do minimax for combat ? I can only think of a one step min-max where you try predict opponent moves which right now is no movement for me.
2011-11-28T17:56:11  <jstrong> 1v1 combat is not only "good"
2011-11-28T17:56:15  <jstrong> i believe it to be crucial
2011-11-28T17:56:26  <jstrong> huge frontlines are good to maintain but they generally generate stalemates
2011-11-28T17:56:27  <BenJackson_> 1v1?  all you can do is not suicide
2011-11-28T17:56:33  <jstrong> well
2011-11-28T17:56:38  <jstrong> i'm usin 1v1 loosely
2011-11-28T17:56:41  <BenJackson_> well and goad them into not suiciding
2011-11-28T17:56:48  <jstrong> 2v1 battles mainly
2011-11-28T17:56:53  <jstrong> picking off lone ants of your enemy
2011-11-28T17:57:01  <jstrong> instead of worrying SO much about the huge frontline battle
2011-11-28T17:57:11  <jstrong> get the "ant zapping" of lonely ants nailed
2011-11-28T17:57:17  <jstrong> cut off his opponent from his foragers
2011-11-28T17:57:22  <jstrong> starve him to death
2011-11-28T17:57:29  <jstrong> attrition
2011-11-28T17:57:45  <jstrong> its like in age of empires
2011-11-28T17:57:48  <jstrong> 2
2011-11-28T17:57:54  <jstrong> killing your enemies sheep was crucial xD
2011-11-28T17:58:06  <besh> jstrong: easier said than done :)
2011-11-28T17:58:15  <jstrong> besh: indeed
2011-11-28T17:58:40  <jstrong> cut off your opponent from his foragers**
2011-11-28T17:59:17  <olexs1> cutting off from foragers has less effect than in aoe, since ants don't have to carry food back :)

2011-11-28T18:00:33  <jstrong> yeah thats what i mean olexs1
2011-11-28T18:00:38  <jstrong> analogy is not perfect
2011-11-28T18:00:43  <jstrong> but i meant picking off enemy foragers
2011-11-28T18:01:02  <jstrong> so really even if you have a shitty combat system that is too slow to work with a big frontline battle with tons of ants
2011-11-28T18:01:12  <jstrong> if you get that algorithm nailed for the mini small battles
2011-11-28T18:01:17  <jstrong> your bot will be way awesome
2011-11-28T18:01:19  <jstrong> at least that's my theory
2011-11-28T18:01:22  <olexs1> consistently winnign 2v1s is also fairly difficult, because there is almost always a way for 1 to take out one of the 2 with him, unless he gets cornered
2011-11-28T18:01:38  <jstrong> A seems to have figured it out :P
2011-11-28T18:01:40  <BenJackson_> and that "cornering" happens the instant they initially meet
2011-11-28T18:01:40  <jstrong> it can be done

2011-11-28T18:02:08  <BenJackson_> right
2011-11-28T18:02:22  <BenJackson_> but what terrain they'll back into is determined when they first engage

2011-11-28T18:02:29  <jstrong> but he almost rarely loses the mini battles
2011-11-28T18:02:30  <olexs1> only in that case can you make sure he gets killed and you lose none with, whatever he'll do

2011-11-28T22:29:31  <BenJackson> and seems quite effective

2011-11-28T22:33:33  <ChrisH_> BenJackson, thestinger It's been a while since we've chatted 'cause I've been focused in on my bot, but my latest version is doing rather well, so I have come up for air. How you been?
2011-11-28T22:33:50  <BenJackson> Very similar
2011-11-28T22:33:58  <BenJackson> thought I was done for a while when the new version did well on fluxid
2011-11-28T22:34:04  <BenJackson> but it's floundering a bit on the official site
2011-11-28T22:35:00  <ChrisH_> Yeah, I saw a bunch of your bots on Fluxid, any idea why it's not doing well on the main servers? Could it be the shorter turn time?
2011-11-28T22:35:11  <BenJackson> nope, I don't use a timer at all
2011-11-28T22:35:44  <BenJackson> I seem to be doing poorly at the many way battles
2011-11-28T22:36:21  <BenJackson> I should extract the fluxid data and check that theory
2011-11-28T22:36:52  <thestinger> ChrisH_: well, I think my new version is now way better :)
2011-11-28T22:37:58  <ChrisH_> thestinger: cool, I assume it's not on the main server yet, since you haven't uploaed in a few weeks (strcat, right?)
2011-11-28T22:38:02  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-28T22:38:07  <thestinger> a lot has changed
2011-11-28T22:38:20  <thestinger> I basically have a completely new bot
2011-11-28T22:38:31  <thestinger> I haven't had time to optimize/clean it up fully so I haven't reuploaded yet
2011-11-28T22:38:34  <ChrisH_> I also saw you had several versions on Fluxid last time I was on there.
2011-11-28T22:38:37  <thestinger> been adding too many features
2011-11-28T22:38:50  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_flock there's my best version with my old combat
2011-11-28T22:38:57  <thestinger> it just assumes enemies don't move
2011-11-28T22:39:15  <thestinger> _jedimindtricks and _foodfight and proper combat basically using a payoff matrix, but they don't really work yet
2011-11-28T22:39:43  <thestinger> the version on the site basically doesn't know about enemies at all :)
2011-11-28T22:40:25  <ChrisH_> thestinger: Here's one where we were in the same game: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1630
2011-11-28T22:41:03  <ChrisH_> I'm Ombedor8 in that game.
2011-11-28T22:41:39  <thestinger> ah, nice
2011-11-28T22:42:35  <thestinger> still using Go? :)
2011-11-28T22:43:09  <thestinger> I've actually grown to somewhat like C++ now... but I would hate it without the C++11 features
2011-11-28T22:43:42  <ChrisH_> Yes, still using Go, and my current code now uses goroutines, which was interesting to learn the strenghts and weaknesses of.
2011-11-28T22:45:00  <ChrisH_> I have one goroutine for doing all the combat calcs, and one for all the noncombat stuff, and a main one to collect the results and send them to the server.
2011-11-28T22:45:16  <thestinger> neat
2011-11-28T22:45:21  <thestinger> goroutines are really cool
2011-11-28T22:45:49  <mleise> thestinger: neat is actually a programming language developped by some lisp programmer hanging around in the D channel
2011-11-28T22:45:58  <ChrisH_> And for  a while I had another one sleeping until the turn limit was close, wake up and tell the others to stop working and send the known orders, but there were scheduling problems.
2011-11-28T22:46:46  <ChrisH_> So I had to abandon that and just have the main worker goroutines just check the time themselves every so often and that is very reliable and only slightly slower.

2011-11-28T22:47:36  <mleise> damn this programming language inflation. it feels like 1920
2011-11-28T22:47:38  * avdg has a compiler without c++11 and would need another computer to fix that problem
2011-11-28T22:47:44  <thestinger> my C++ code uses a lot of lambdas and higher-order functions now
2011-11-28T22:47:57  <ChrisH_> Yes, although what I actually do is use channels to coordinate it all by letting the workers pass a token between each other and whoever has the token gets the CPU, and whenever the token changes hands is when I check the time.

2011-11-28T22:49:08  <ChrisH_> Those are great, and I'd love to use them, but since the go compiler doesn't do much automatic optimization right now I have to avoid them for speed reasons.
2011-11-28T22:49:15  <thestinger> and I have 'const' on almost everything, it's like ghetto haskell
2011-11-28T22:49:18  <mleise> thestinger: I'm new to functional programming, can you show me a good example where the execution speed is as high as for non-functional code, but the solution is more concise/shorter?
2011-11-28T22:49:57  <thestinger> well, I have a single BFS implementation
2011-11-28T22:50:13  <thestinger> I pass in a lambda which changes what it does with every iteration
2011-11-28T22:50:34  <thestinger> before I had 4 different implementations
2011-11-28T22:50:49  <thestinger> so this cut the binary size down a lot, and there's a huge speed gain (maybe due to cache)
2011-11-28T22:50:57  <mleise> ah ok. I recently had some code that I thought should be run 3 times with different actions taken
2011-11-28T22:51:43  <thestinger> [this](Location loc, int distance) { set this->something++ or whatever }
2011-11-28T22:51:51  <mleise> it gets difficult when the 3 or 4 implementations differ in more than just a single location that can be replaced by a function pointer / lambda
2011-11-28T22:51:55  <thestinger> so I can pass something like that into a function, and set something in an object

2011-11-28T22:52:37  <thestinger> map, fold and filter are the obvious examples of higher-order functions
2011-11-28T22:53:16  <mleise> I never thought about passing more than the local function scope (aka closure). object references are a whole new dimension
2011-11-28T22:53:36  <thestinger> when I figuring out the C++ lambdas this was the first thing I implemented: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/514276/
2011-11-28T22:54:08  <thestinger> sadly you can't you the range based for with gcc 4.5 on the server (but that's not important)
2011-11-28T22:54:15  <thestinger> so I can do
2011-11-28T22:54:36  <thestinger> cont = filter([](int i) { return i < 10; }, cont);
2011-11-28T22:54:49  <thestinger> for any of the standard library containers
2011-11-28T22:55:09  <thestinger> rather than writing for loops everywhere
2011-11-28T22:55:32  <thestinger> I'm not really using that but I just made it to see if C++ lambdas were any good :P
2011-11-28T22:55:54  <thestinger> implementing fold would be more useful
2011-11-28T22:56:06  <mleise> ok, would that have been more ugly with function pointers?
2011-11-28T22:56:11  <ChrisH_> here is something cool from Go: you can call a closure as a goroutine. Pretty wild.
2011-11-28T22:56:22  <thestinger> ChrisH_: channels of channels of functions? :P

2011-11-28T22:58:27  <thestinger> mleise: yeah, you can't do much with function pointers
2011-11-28T22:58:34  <thestinger> and they are really ugly without std::function in C++
2011-11-28T22:59:16  <thestinger> because with function pointers, the functions have to be defined globally
2011-11-28T22:59:24  <amstan> sigh..
2011-11-28T22:59:34  <amstan> i have that i wanna make an awesome game feeling
2011-11-28T22:59:38  <mleise> return array( pipe!( readText, split, map!(to!double) )( filename ) );   // who knows what this does?
2011-11-28T22:59:48  <thestinger> you can't capture state like a lambda, or even have nested functions
2011-11-28T23:00:52  <mleise> amstan: I know that. But It is not like I'm satisfied with another pac man clone any more :-(

2011-11-28T23:01:43  <BenJackson> not sure if that's randomness or the particular maps or what
2011-11-28T23:02:13  <amstan> randomness? i don't think so
2011-11-28T23:02:17  <amstan> it seems fairly consistent
2011-11-28T23:02:21  <thestinger> mleise: the nice thing about std::function is that it's generic, that filter function can take a function pointer, functor or lambda as an argument
2011-11-28T23:02:24  <besh> it is odd you get higher rating with 10 players
2011-11-28T23:02:26  <mleise> looks like above 5 players there is a fair bit of randomness
2011-11-28T23:02:42  <BenJackson> besh: that means "averaging 3rd place"

2011-11-28T23:02:49  <BenJackson> vs basically 1st in all 1-v-1
2011-11-28T23:02:52  <amstan> wait.. nvm, what happened at 6?
2011-11-28T23:02:59  <besh> oh in that case it makes sense.
2011-11-28T23:03:06  <BenJackson> apparently I screw the pooch around 6
2011-11-28T23:03:21  <BenJackson> which is not inconsistent with the aichallenge results :)
2011-11-28T23:03:34  <amstan> BenJackson: that's weird then, lol
2011-11-28T23:03:42  <amstan> i would have expected that to be map errors
2011-11-28T23:04:13  <BenJackson> I could have written the sql for that about 1013408124 times faster than parsing it out of html
2011-11-28T23:07:01  <mleise> thestinger: I took a look at Rust. It has nice ideas but I cannot evaluate a language from what is there. How will the tools be? Will it work well in all practical fields? What about unit testing? How good will the compiler be? For now it is mostly an idea and probably a seemingly clean language design. But that is how other languages started out as well ^^
2011-11-28T23:07:45  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-28T23:08:02  <mleise> I really like how you can have this special pattern matching switch-case thing to write a nice "direction to angle" function
2011-11-28T23:08:21  <mleise> or "direction vector to angle" to be precise

2011-11-28T23:17:03  <thestinger> mleise: giving closures references to objects/containers and then passing them to generic functions has definitely cleaned up my code a lot
2011-11-28T23:17:18  <BenJackson> amstan: I can just ignore issues with maps featuring 1-square wide gaps, right?
2011-11-28T23:17:31  <amstan> BenJackson: no
2011-11-28T23:17:32  <thestinger> well I mean lambdas
2011-11-28T23:17:44  <amstan> BenJackson: there might be bigger paths around
2011-11-28T23:18:24  <mleise> isn't a lambda closing over some outer scope a closure?
2011-11-28T23:21:54  <ChrisH_> mleise: that sounds right to me

2011-11-28T23:36:34  <thestinger> on fluxid?
2011-11-28T23:36:42  <besh> yeap
2011-11-28T23:36:58  <besh> i guess the strong engines connect during the day
2011-11-28T23:37:26  <thestinger> my mu slowly drops until I improve something
2011-11-28T23:38:07  <thestinger> yay, another big bugfix :)
2011-11-28T23:38:25  <besh> Hmm flock seem to working though :)
2011-11-28T23:38:55  <thestinger> yeah, _next _flock and _dense are basically the same
2011-11-28T23:39:10  <thestinger> I'm working on better combat atm

2011-11-28T23:39:53  <rwest_> so I have found out I can be "lone survivor" and still come in 2nd
2011-11-28T23:39:54  <besh> yes that is the key. But I don't know how to go about it.
2011-11-28T23:39:57  <rwest_> lame
2011-11-28T23:40:34  <besh> I heard some min-max talks here but I don't know how that can be applied with imperfect information.. maybe a shallow one.
2011-11-28T23:40:57  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma I'm just treating it like this
2011-11-28T23:41:08  <thestinger> so no prediction beyond the current turn
2011-11-28T23:41:13  <besh> rwest: you just time out and get that 1 point
2011-11-28T23:42:03  <sf17k> the goal is very much to raze hills
2011-11-28T23:42:14  <sf17k> not get more ants, not kill other ants
2011-11-28T23:42:30  <besh> thestinger: wouldn't that require cooperation between players ?
2011-11-28T23:42:33  <sf17k> although those help
2011-11-28T23:42:44  <thestinger> besh: no
2011-11-28T23:43:09  <thestinger> atm I just do it a really simple way
2011-11-28T23:43:18  <thestinger> I pick out a defensive set of moves for myself, and an offensive set
2011-11-28T23:43:27  <rwest_> besh: I killed all the ants on the board, just not the hill yet, had I killed the 2 hills left, I would have won
2011-11-28T23:43:36  <thestinger> the same thing for the "enemy" (I just have them all attack me)
2011-11-28T23:43:50  <sf17k> rwest_: ah that is interesting
2011-11-28T23:43:56  <thestinger> then I run 2x2 battle simulations and pick the best result
2011-11-28T23:44:06  <sf17k> but don't you get bonus points in that situation?
2011-11-28T23:44:10  <thestinger> eventually I'll do a _lot_ more than just 4 evaluations per battle
2011-11-28T23:44:11  <sf17k> so it counts as if you'd killed the hills
2011-11-28T23:44:25  <rwest_> hmmm
2011-11-28T23:44:30  <rwest_> he had 2 hills left
2011-11-28T23:44:36  <sf17k> btw first version of my bot is playing its first game
2011-11-28T23:44:36  <rwest_> I got 4 bonus points
2011-11-28T23:44:43  <besh> thestinger: So you assume the worst (the paronoid algorithm i suppose). All players gang up on you
2011-11-28T23:44:51  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-28T23:44:54  <rwest_> is it not 3 points to kill the hill yourself?
2011-11-28T23:45:00  <sf17k> I think it's 2
2011-11-28T23:45:10  <rwest_> ahh I see
2011-11-28T23:45:11  <rwest_> ok then
2011-11-28T23:45:20  <rwest_> I still think lone survivor should be win condition
2011-11-28T23:45:33  <rwest_> regardless of how many points the person in first has
2011-11-28T23:45:34  <thestinger> besh: before, I just pretended enemies never moved so that my bot could break through defenses, etc.
2011-11-28T23:46:00  <besh> yes that is what I still do
2011-11-28T23:46:26  <thestinger> strcat_jedimindtricks and strcat_foodfight will be using my new combat code
2011-11-28T23:46:35  <thestinger> it had a bug so it hasn't actually worked yet
2011-11-28T23:46:40  <thestinger> probably still doesn't work properly xD
2011-11-28T23:48:01  <besh> my combat code tries to place ants on enemy's attack_radius + 1 border
2011-11-28T23:48:17  <besh> then goes in for the kill when it sees it outnumbered the opponent
2011-11-28T23:48:40  <besh> problem is i don't check if it is suicidal to place an ant at a certain location.
2011-11-28T23:49:21  <besh> The attack rules are  complicated to implement and I am not sure if i understand it either.
2011-11-28T23:49:59  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/specification_battle.php
2011-11-28T23:50:08  <thestinger> the math/pseudo-code at the bottom explain it well

2011-11-28T23:51:16  <besh> yes, if it was something like "you control a location if you attack it more than the opponent" then it would have been easy.
2011-11-28T23:51:54  <besh> But it says that "the ants you attack should be attacked more than you are , for you to survive", which is difficult for me to implement
2011-11-28T23:53:42  <besh> What I mean it is not enough to know you are attacked, but also by which ants to resolve the battle. Anyway I am sure others find it easy though.
2011-11-28T23:54:21  <thestinger> definitely not easy to figure out combat

2011-11-28T23:55:05  <thestinger> it's hard to know how aggressive you should be
2011-11-28T23:55:15  <thestinger> even the top bots end up in a lot of standoffs they could win
2011-11-28T23:55:50  <besh> yes most are cautious.
2011-11-28T23:56:30  <analyst74> that's the characteristic of min-max
2011-11-28T23:57:26  <besh> maybe one can try learning. Be aggressive see what ants get killed then be cautious in that area. I never used the dead ants input but it could be meant for that kind of analysis.
2011-11-28T23:57:39  <thestinger> well you have to adjust how you evaluate the score
