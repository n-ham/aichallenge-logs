2012-03-05T04:19:55  <mcstar> thestinger: hey
2012-03-05T04:22:31  <thestinger> hi
2012-03-05T04:22:49  <thestinger> doing unit 3 of the udacity cs373 course atm
2012-03-05T04:24:02  <thestinger> mcstar: they had what is perhaps the worst guest speaker appearance ever in the cs101 course :P
2012-03-05T04:24:23  <thestinger> 10 seconds of sergey brin talking... he obviously had something better to do
2012-03-05T04:24:51  <mcstar> hah
2012-03-05T04:24:52  <thestinger> http://youtu.be/4R3JZ6mNrpU
2012-03-05T04:25:12  <mcstar> i just wanted to say what happened to me and arch
2012-03-05T04:25:32  <mcstar> i updated the kernel, mkinitcpio afaik succeeded
2012-03-05T04:25:33  <mcstar> but
2012-03-05T04:25:54  <mcstar> my initramfs couldnt handle the ext3 system partition after reboot
2012-03-05T04:26:22  <thestinger> oh, I seem to remember reading something about that on the mailing list
2012-03-05T04:26:30  <mcstar> recently?
2012-03-05T04:26:36  <thestinger> were you using [testing]? (well, maybe it got moved to [core] but I'm not sure)
2012-03-05T04:26:45  <mcstar> i dont using testing
2012-03-05T04:26:52  <thestinger> they flipped on a setting to use the ext4 module for ext2 and ext3 like fedora is doing
2012-03-05T04:27:02  <thestinger> I don't know if they turned it off before moving it to [core]
2012-03-05T04:27:15  <mcstar> well, i solved it by adding the ext3 module explicitely to mkinitcpio.conf
2012-03-05T04:27:42  <mcstar> but first i had to fiddle with a pendrive to actually chroot my system
2012-03-05T04:27:55  <mcstar> pita
2012-03-05T04:28:10  <thestinger> yeah
2012-03-05T04:28:29  <thestinger> if you install linux-lts, then you have another kernel to fall back to
2012-03-05T04:28:57  <mcstar> while i was at it, i made a freedos disk to run wdidle3.exe, so as to lenghten my WD caviar green's head unload time
2012-03-05T04:29:20  <thestinger> oh, is it one of those drives that parks the head after a second or two?
2012-03-05T04:29:21  <mcstar> probably its a good idea to keep some bakcup kernel/ramfs
2012-03-05T04:29:24  <thestinger> and then kills itself
2012-03-05T04:29:26  <mcstar> 8 secs
2012-03-05T04:29:35  <mcstar> i increased it to 300
2012-03-05T04:29:46  <mcstar> it had 270000 load/unload cycles in a year

2012-03-05T04:29:50  <thestinger> heh, so freedos actually has a purpose
2012-03-05T04:29:54  <mcstar> yeah :)
2012-03-05T04:30:05  <thestinger> I wonder if that works in reactos
2012-03-05T04:30:30  <mcstar> i wanted to try it years ago
2012-03-05T04:30:39  <mcstar> but instead i went with beos
2012-03-05T04:30:51  <mcstar> (while i was still searching for the perfect os)
2012-03-05T04:31:02  <mcstar> how silly of me. but i was a kid..
2012-03-05T04:33:45  <thestinger> I've just left debian installed on my plug computer because it's a real PITA to deal with something going wrong
2012-03-05T04:34:13  <thestinger> but having to install a dozen up-to-date versions of stuff is pretty annoying too...
2012-03-05T04:34:39  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-03-05T04:34:43  <mcstar> rugular updates?
2012-03-05T04:34:45  <mcstar> e
2012-03-05T04:34:53  <thestinger> well it's debian stable, so the software is from 2008
2012-03-05T04:35:00  <mcstar> oh
2012-03-05T04:35:20  <mcstar> well, i promised myslef to buy a pendrive for this pupose, but i always forget
2012-03-05T04:35:51  <thestinger> to get to the bootloader/consoles in the plug computer I have to set up this JTAG stuff
2012-03-05T04:35:58  <thestinger> I forget how so I really don't want to deal with it again
2012-03-05T04:36:18  <mcstar> i have no idea what jtag is
2012-03-05T04:36:41  <thestinger> it's some kind of "open" standard for connections to embedded stuff
2012-03-05T04:36:47  <thestinger> but each vendor implements the details differently

2012-03-05T04:37:20  <mcstar> i see, so actually i dont know what a plug computer is
2012-03-05T04:37:24  <thestinger> oh
2012-03-05T04:37:45  <thestinger> it's just a little ARM computer, uses ~2-5 watts
2012-03-05T04:37:48  <thestinger> I use it as a server
2012-03-05T04:38:14  <mcstar> cute
2012-03-05T04:38:17  <mcstar> serving what?
2012-03-05T04:38:39  <thestinger> well I run my torrent client on there (transmission-daemon), and some other stuff

2012-03-05T15:01:16  <thestinger> yet another reason not to use python2
2012-03-05T15:01:29  <thestinger> it's a crazy feminist :P http://sprunge.us/ZDBS
2012-03-05T15:05:48  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/XNTM and with non-broken classes, it's a misogynist
2012-03-05T15:08:47  <mcstar> you are changing the definition order of the classes
2012-03-05T15:10:20  <mcstar> btw, thanks for the new word
2012-03-05T15:11:48  <thestinger> mcstar: no, python2 is stupid and compares types without >, <, >=, <= overloaded by their name
2012-03-05T15:13:02  <mcstar> no?
2012-03-05T15:13:04  <mcstar> yes you are
2012-03-05T15:13:23  <thestinger> I am, but that's not the reason
2012-03-05T15:13:27  <mcstar> the last defined class becomes 'higher'
2012-03-05T15:13:35  <thestinger> mcstar: http://sprunge.us/icZf
2012-03-05T15:14:25  <mcstar> now this is more interesting
2012-03-05T15:15:16  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/jeSO python3 believes in gender equality
2012-03-05T15:15:36  <thestinger> mcstar: the part I don't understand is why "new-style" classes (inheriting from object) are ordered differently
2012-03-05T15:15:52  <thestinger> all classes inherit from object in python3 so there's nothing to compare there
2012-03-05T15:16:33  <thestinger> mcstar: I think I know why the feature exists
2012-03-05T15:16:36  <thestinger> for sorting
2012-03-05T15:16:58  <mcstar> what is object?
2012-03-05T15:17:08  <thestinger> the base class basically
2012-03-05T15:17:15  <thestinger> in python3, everything inherits from it in a tree
2012-03-05T15:17:22  <thestinger> there's no difference between a class and a type
2012-03-05T15:17:50  <thestinger> in python2, a class that inherits from object is a type (otherwise the instances just have the type 'instance')
2012-03-05T15:18:13  <mcstar> so in python2 is there a change when you explicitely subclass 'object'?
2012-03-05T15:18:17  <thestinger> yes
2012-03-05T15:18:22  <mcstar> ok
2012-03-05T15:18:29  <thestinger> you're actually supposed to do it for all classes
2012-03-05T15:18:43  <mcstar> ive never seen that
2012-03-05T15:18:54  <mcstar> (not that i should have, but ive seen some classes)
2012-03-05T15:18:58  <thestinger> libraries do it, but most users of the language don't know about it
2012-03-05T15:19:10  <thestinger> ofc in python3 it doesn't do anything since all classes are objects/types
2012-03-05T15:20:11  <Zannick> you should inherit from object explicitly in python2
2012-03-05T15:20:23  <thestinger> yeah

2012-03-05T15:26:21  <mcstar> thestinger: couple days ago sprunge was down right?
2012-03-05T15:26:37  <mcstar> i tried pasting, but i didnt get the link back
2012-03-05T15:29:25  <thestinger> not sure
2012-03-05T15:29:50  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vY2py I would just use that instead
2012-03-05T15:30:17  <mcstar> what is 'test'?
2012-03-05T15:30:21  <mcstar> lolz
2012-03-05T15:31:16  <thestinger> just did echo test | ompload
2012-03-05T15:31:43  <mcstar> sorry, i was joking
2012-03-05T15:31:57  <mcstar> thats what i tried to signify with ;lolz;
2012-03-05T15:32:06  * thestinger feels stupid now
2012-03-05T15:32:59  <mcstar> ok, i have their script now
2012-03-05T15:33:12  <mcstar> they support file uploads, thats nice
2012-03-05T15:33:33  <mcstar> but i already use imgur for images
2012-03-05T15:33:49  <mcstar> hm
2012-03-05T15:33:59  <thestinger> you can upload random binary files or whatever to ompldr though
2012-03-05T15:34:11  <mcstar> i wonder when will they seize their domain
2012-03-05T15:35:12  <mcstar> honestly, those american authorities use way much falcons in the insignias
2012-03-05T15:35:15  <thestinger> it's run by someone who uses the nick omp on freenode and they're often in #archlinux-offtopic, so everyone there uses it
2012-03-05T15:35:20  <mcstar> way too much*
2012-03-05T15:35:35  <thestinger> half the images are freebsd and archlinux screenshots
2012-03-05T15:35:40  <mcstar> oh
2012-03-05T15:35:47  <mcstar> btw, i was talking about megaupload
2012-03-05T15:35:54  <mcstar> did you see the notice?
2012-03-05T15:36:07  <thestinger> yeah, it's been in the news
2012-03-05T15:36:32  <thestinger> they took it down _before_ the trial
2012-03-05T15:36:39  <mcstar> haha
2012-03-05T15:36:47  <thestinger> and it was based out of new zealand
2012-03-05T15:36:51  <thestinger> but somehow the US got it taken down
2012-03-05T15:37:06  <thestinger> and the people who ran it are on trial in new zealand now
2012-03-05T15:38:34  <mcstar> i just read an article about the ;alleged' hacker, that german guy
2012-03-05T15:39:09  <mcstar> it seems the EU reconsideres acta
2012-03-05T15:39:19  <mcstar> stupid politicians
2012-03-05T15:39:26  <mcstar> hm
2012-03-05T15:39:30  <mcstar> that came out wrong
2012-03-05T15:39:44  <mcstar> they are stupid cause they were considering legislating it
2012-03-05T15:40:09  <mcstar> anyway, omploader cannot deal with arch's current kernel
2012-03-05T15:40:26  <mcstar> mabe it is too big
2012-03-05T15:40:28  <mcstar> y
2012-03-05T15:42:54  <thestinger> there's a 1GiB limit now
2012-03-05T15:42:57  <thestinger> used to be bigger
2012-03-05T15:43:03  <mcstar> kernel is 3mbs
2012-03-05T15:43:05  <mcstar> error: curl failed to return a response uploading 'piped data'

2012-03-05T15:43:26  <thestinger> mcstar: how did you try uploading?
2012-03-05T15:43:27  <mcstar> i cant dd some urandom up to omp

2012-03-05T15:43:44  <thestinger> hm
2012-03-05T15:43:54  <mcstar> with text its ok

2012-03-05T15:51:40  <thestinger> not sure why they included this misfeature at all
2012-03-05T15:51:46  <thestinger> I can't excuse it by saying it's for sorting now
2012-03-05T15:51:59  <mcstar> does it matter?
2012-03-05T15:52:01  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/FjfI
2012-03-05T15:52:06  <mcstar> python is duck-taped
2012-03-05T15:52:07  <thestinger> so glad they removed that from the language
2012-03-05T15:52:20  <thestinger> mcstar: look at that, it's awful
2012-03-05T15:52:49  <Zannick> lol
2012-03-05T15:52:57  <thestinger> mcstar: it still matters, it raises an exception in python3 like it should
2012-03-05T15:53:03  <mcstar> thestinger: pls, move from your location immediately, you are living in a radioactively highly contaminated area
2012-03-05T15:53:07  <thestinger> for the same reason 1 + "cat" raises one
2012-03-05T15:53:11  <Zannick> or you define the appropriate __lt__ methods!
2012-03-05T15:53:23  <thestinger> yeah
2012-03-05T15:53:29  <thestinger> really not sure why python2 does this
2012-03-05T15:53:55  <mcstar> quak
2012-03-05T15:54:04  <thestinger> ah
2012-03-05T15:54:16  <thestinger> with new-style classes they are compared with lexicographic sort order (of the type name)
2012-03-05T15:54:25  <thestinger> with old-style classes? no idea wtf is going on...
2012-03-05T15:54:51  <mcstar> maybe the reason is, that the two classes are really really close to each other, and thermal fluctuations cause the one to be bigger than the other
2012-03-05T15:55:56  <mcstar> so no surprise there, you should just have to take an ensemble-average, like statistical physics teaches us
2012-03-05T15:56:33  <thestinger> maybe pickling can explain it somehow
2012-03-05T15:57:00  <mcstar> who is he?
