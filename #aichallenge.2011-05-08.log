2011-05-08T00:05:16  <janzert> amstan: same as a main server basically but run worker_setup.py instead of server_setup.py
2011-05-08T00:05:44  <amstan> it should work if i execute it on the same server with the manager, right?
2011-05-08T00:05:59  <janzert> I believe so but I haven't tested that in a while
2011-05-08T00:06:40  <janzert> also the cron job and worker startup script mentioned in the setup don't actually work
2011-05-08T00:06:54  <janzert> it is still pointing to the old planetwars scripts
2011-05-08T00:06:58  <amstan> API Base url?  would be http://hypertriangle.com:13080/ right?
2011-05-08T00:07:08  <janzert> yep
2011-05-08T00:07:15  <amstan> where do i get the api key from?
2011-05-08T00:07:17  <janzert> where api_* pages are found
2011-05-08T00:07:36  <janzert> you set it in the main server server_info.php
2011-05-08T00:07:55  <janzert> it can be any string basically
2011-05-08T00:08:01  <amstan> what's the key for that property?
2011-05-08T00:08:07  <janzert> I'd recommend a random 128bit hex number :)
2011-05-08T00:08:15  <amstan> there's no line with key in there
2011-05-08T00:08:36  <janzert> I don't remember what the variable name is offhand...
2011-05-08T00:09:10  <janzert> looks like it is 'api_key'
2011-05-08T00:09:28  <janzert> actually I'm wrong
2011-05-08T00:10:29  <janzert> the api_key in the server_info.php is used for api_server_setup.php and it generates a specific worker key
2011-05-08T00:10:39  <janzert> it is the worker key that the worker_setup.py needs
2011-05-08T00:10:52  <janzert> you'll need to manually insert that into the main server database
2011-05-08T00:11:24  <amstan> so, what do i need to do then? run api_server_setup.php?
2011-05-08T00:11:52  <janzert> basically pick a key then "insert into worker SET api_key = 'workerkey', ip_address = '<worker ip address>';"
2011-05-08T00:12:11  <janzert> the api_server_setup.php is for automatic worker setup with ec2
2011-05-08T00:12:18  <amstan> ok.. first.. i have to get api_key into the server_info.php
2011-05-08T00:12:27  <amstan> i wanted to fix that first, on the template ones too
2011-05-08T00:13:01  <janzert> you should be able to actually skip the api_key in server_info.php unless you'll be doing automatic worker deployment
2011-05-08T00:13:24  <amstan> yeah, but i'm both verifying that everything goes smooothly and setting this up
2011-05-08T00:13:27  <janzert> it should only be used in api_server_setup
2011-05-08T00:13:35  <amstan> so i want to have the repo either working nicely, or documented at the end
2011-05-08T00:14:12  <janzert> and api_server_setup.php is broked too
2011-05-08T00:14:32  <janzert> obviously since it still points at the old svn repo :P
2011-05-08T00:14:36  <amstan> yeah
2011-05-08T00:14:38  <amstan> i noticed
2011-05-08T00:16:17  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * rc5bb76d / (4 files in 4 dirs): deleted duplicate sample files(all the templates are now in the setup folder), added the api_key option in the sample server_info.php - http://bit.ly/muCk0Z
2011-05-08T00:16:18  <amstan> k.. so..
2011-05-08T00:16:21  <amstan> now there's that..
2011-05-08T00:16:30  <amstan> i need to make a random 128 bit string
2011-05-08T00:18:19  <amstan> there we go: print "%x"%random.randint(0,2**128)

2011-05-08T00:35:25  <amstan> janzert: what's with $server_info["api_create_key"] ?
2011-05-08T00:36:22  <janzert> sorry, yes 'api_create_key' is the correct variable name in server_info.php
2011-05-08T00:36:27  <amstan> ugh..
2011-05-08T00:36:36  <janzert> no idea about memcached
2011-05-08T00:37:00  <amstan> janzert: the real problem with memcached is that it didn't have a check if it was loading like the other files, my commit fixed that
2011-05-08T00:38:59  <janzert> but it still isn't working correctly?
2011-05-08T00:39:38  <janzert> from what McLeopold said before it sounded like the package just needed to be installed on the server and no further configuration was necessary
2011-05-08T00:40:02  <amstan> janzert: it worked on my main hypertriangle server, but on the test 13000 server it didn't
2011-05-08T00:40:10  <amstan> seems like the module is not active or something
2011-05-08T00:40:17  <amstan> even though i did a2enmod
2011-05-08T00:40:25  <amstan> maybe the firewall is still active or something
2011-05-08T00:40:34  <amstan> i don't think ufw is disabled
2011-05-08T00:40:57  <janzert> it'd be rather weird for a firewall to be blocking localhost communication
2011-05-08T00:41:27  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * rcf1e0ac / setup/server_info.php.template : real key for the setting of api_create_key - http://bit.ly/isFTZS
2011-05-08T00:44:13  <amstan> janzert: why is server_info.php owned by root? is that my bad or is it supposed to be that way?
2011-05-08T00:47:21  <amstan> janzert: ok.. so i have the server_key setup properly.. i have a key from server_setup.php
2011-05-08T00:47:30  <amstan> though it's giving me all kinds of other random stuff
2011-05-08T00:47:42  <amstan> from the svn, that's not valid anymore
2011-05-08T00:48:03  <amstan> i guess we'll have to fix that sometime
2011-05-08T00:48:22  <amstan> what does Install startup cronjob? [no]  do?
2011-05-08T00:50:50  <amstan> oh my.. all these packages
2011-05-08T00:51:24  * amstan wonders why /var/cache/apt/archives is not used, they're all already in there
2011-05-08T00:51:43  <amstan> would cut down installation time a lot
2011-05-08T00:52:14  <janzert> the startup cronjob would install a cronjob to start the worker script on a reboot
2011-05-08T00:52:29  <amstan> how do i do this manually?
2011-05-08T00:52:34  <janzert> all packages are being installed in a chroot so the base system isn't available
2011-05-08T00:52:44  <janzert> what part?
2011-05-08T00:52:56  <amstan> the worker.py script
2011-05-08T00:53:12  <amstan> mcleopold gave me an example, but i just want to make sure we're all on the same wavelength
2011-05-08T00:53:21  <janzert> I haven't actually run it
2011-05-08T00:53:22  <amstan> something like ./worker.py 0
2011-05-08T00:53:24  <amstan> oh
2011-05-08T00:53:30  <janzert> but just look at the bottom of the file
2011-05-08T00:53:40  <janzert> you can see the optparse stuff pretty easily
2011-05-08T00:53:55  <janzert> it's something like worker.py -t something something :}
2011-05-08T00:54:20  <amstan> what does worker_init.py do?
2011-05-08T00:54:35  <amstan> it has something to do with that .tgz file, when do i run that?
2011-05-08T00:54:41  <amstan> or did it already?
2011-05-08T00:54:43  <janzert> you don't
2011-05-08T00:55:05  <janzert> it's used for the automatic deploy to setup the environment to run worker_setup.py
2011-05-08T00:55:16  <amstan> well shit: http://pastebin.com/z2JEyaQY
2011-05-08T00:55:18  <amstan> lol
2011-05-08T00:55:26  <amstan> oh.. right..
2011-05-08T00:55:32  <amstan> that might be one issue, i don't have amd64
2011-05-08T00:55:33  <janzert> e.g. create the worker, download that .tgz file, unpack it in the right spot
2011-05-08T00:55:52  <janzert> hmm
2011-05-08T00:56:23  <janzert> you can try just changing it to i386 and see if it works I suppose
2011-05-08T00:56:52  <janzert> although your system is going to be in a state that worker_setup probably can't continue from at this point
2011-05-08T00:56:54  <amstan> full paste: http://pastebin.com/fMg60AbN
2011-05-08T00:57:04  <amstan> anything that i can delete?
2011-05-08T00:57:28  <janzert> /srv/chroot/* and let me check if there's anything else
2011-05-08T00:57:53  <amstan> there's an aic-base
2011-05-08T00:57:56  <amstan> i could delete that
2011-05-08T00:59:26  <janzert> yep, I think just 'rm -rf /srv/chroot' should do it
2011-05-08T00:59:52  <janzert> from where the script crashed there
2011-05-08T01:00:14  <amstan> any idea how to make ubuntu regurgitate what arch and version it is?
2011-05-08T01:00:23  <amstan> i could try looking in sources.list, but that's a hack
2011-05-08T01:00:30  <amstan> i think there was a file in /etc/ or something
2011-05-08T01:00:37  <janzert> looking for?
2011-05-08T01:00:54  <janzert> oh, missed the first question
2011-05-08T01:00:58  <janzert> no idea
2011-05-08T01:01:22  <janzert> there's debian_version
2011-05-08T01:01:30  <janzert> but I'm not sure how to check the ubuntu version
2011-05-08T01:01:41  <amstan>  /etc/lsb-release => DISTRIB_CODENAME=natty
2011-05-08T01:04:16  <janzert> on memcache again, did php5-memcached and memcached packages both get installed?
2011-05-08T01:04:32  <amstan> janzert: yes, i have them both installed, the extension is working
2011-05-08T01:04:40  <janzert> ahh
2011-05-08T01:05:39  <amstan> janzert: i think "if (extension_loaded ('memcache')) {" fails
2011-05-08T01:08:10  <janzert> hmm, that's a php extension nothing to do with apache btw
2011-05-08T01:08:41  <amstan> oh
2011-05-08T01:08:45  <amstan> darn
2011-05-08T01:08:59  <janzert> maybe printing the output of get_loaded_extensions() to see if it is in the list
2011-05-08T01:09:09  <janzert> s/maybe/maybe try
2011-05-08T01:09:11  <amstan> can i do it with php-cli?
2011-05-08T01:09:30  <janzert> I'm not positive if that loads the same extensions or not
2011-05-08T01:09:33  <amstan> array.. ugh..
2011-05-08T01:09:54  <amstan> janzert: how about a php_info
2011-05-08T01:10:35  <janzert> that should list it too
2011-05-08T01:10:39  <amstan> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/phpinfo.php
2011-05-08T01:10:54  <amstan> it's in there..
2011-05-08T01:11:40  <janzert> looks like it's called memcached their and memcache in the code?
2011-05-08T01:12:13  <janzert> McLeopold told me those were the packages he was using but now I wonder
2011-05-08T01:12:31  <janzert> 'cause I know he was going back and forth between a few different ones at one point
2011-05-08T01:12:33  <amstan> well.. presumably the d at the end is fro daemon
2011-05-08T01:13:00  <janzert> yes, but the extension still seems to be named memcached
2011-05-08T01:13:25  <janzert> at least I don't see a plain memcache extension in that list
2011-05-08T01:13:40  <amstan> http://home.hypertriangle.com/phpinfo.php
2011-05-08T01:13:42  <amstan> you're right..
2011-05-08T01:13:49  <amstan> the other server i have is just memcache, without d
2011-05-08T01:14:03  <janzert> both running natty?
2011-05-08T01:14:20  <janzert> wonder if it's something that changed
2011-05-08T01:14:22  <amstan> nope, my home.hypertriangle is karmic

2011-05-08T01:42:14  <janzert> hmm
2011-05-08T01:42:41  <janzert> I'd rather just match the arch
2011-05-08T01:43:02  <amstan> janzert: what?
2011-05-08T01:43:06  <janzert> you need to change more than just that when switching ubuntu versions
2011-05-08T01:43:29  <janzert> e.g. see my commit a while back to update to natty
2011-05-08T01:43:43  <janzert> and if you go older than maverick the changes are much greater
2011-05-08T01:44:03  <amstan> grep -R natty . only return worker_setup.py about a broken package and your sources.list
2011-05-08T01:44:10  <amstan> returns*
2011-05-08T01:44:29  <janzert> yeah, but I'd still rather just stick with a known configuration
2011-05-08T01:44:48  <amstan> we could put a check in the installer, a warning if it's not natty
2011-05-08T01:45:03  <amstan> but i would like to have less things hardcoded
2011-05-08T01:45:04  <janzert> pre-maverick the chroot configuration moves location a couple of times
2011-05-08T01:45:22  <janzert> I'd rather hardcode so we can say, this is what it is
2011-05-08T01:45:29  <amstan> my commits there don't imply we'll be able to use anything but natty
2011-05-08T01:45:53  <amstan> what about putting a check for that?
2011-05-08T01:46:04  <janzert> less magic, more explicit in other words
2011-05-08T01:46:21  <janzert> and throw an error if it's not natty?
2011-05-08T01:46:27  <amstan> yeah
2011-05-08T01:46:30  <janzert> that would be fine
2011-05-08T01:46:35  <amstan> assert version==natty
2011-05-08T01:47:08  <amstan> janzert: about that sources.list, how about copying it from host?
2011-05-08T01:47:15  <janzert> also have you checked to see if changing the arch actually gives you a working system?
2011-05-08T01:47:29  <janzert> I'd rather not
2011-05-08T01:47:32  <amstan> janzert: i'm installing i386 right now
2011-05-08T01:47:51  <janzert> since the host may have extra sources
2011-05-08T01:47:59  <amstan> what's wrong with extra sources?
2011-05-08T01:48:04  <janzert> and we may also want to add some ppa in the future
2011-05-08T01:48:16  <janzert> we could end up with a different version of a package than we expect
2011-05-08T01:48:29  <amstan> is that a problem for the chroot machine?
2011-05-08T01:48:52  <janzert> it's what the bots are compiled and run under
2011-05-08T01:49:14  <amstan> shouldn't that comp have access to the same software as the host?
2011-05-08T01:49:17  <amstan> i don't understand
2011-05-08T01:49:19  <janzert> nope
2011-05-08T01:49:31  <janzert> the chroot only has access to what is installed in it
2011-05-08T01:49:38  <amstan> also, aren't we installing the languages and stuff on the host?
2011-05-08T01:49:42  <janzert> it can technically be a whole different distribution
2011-05-08T01:49:43  <janzert> nope
2011-05-08T01:50:33  <amstan> well.. shit: http://pastebin.com/ZYdt15Xg
2011-05-08T01:50:44  <amstan> my lsb_release doesn't exist in --chroot-setup mode
2011-05-08T01:50:59  <amstan> i should probably move that line, to somewhere where i'm sure it's only ubuntu
2011-05-08T01:51:25  <janzert> ahh, I didn't notice that was setting global variables
2011-05-08T01:51:37  <amstan> janzert: any suggestions?
2011-05-08T01:51:42  <janzert> yeah, just move that line into setup_base_chroot
2011-05-08T01:51:59  <amstan> should i just do it in setup_base_chroot, where it's needed?
2011-05-08T01:52:18  <janzert> yp, setup_base_chroot won't be executed in the chroot itself
2011-05-08T01:52:21  <janzert> yep
2011-05-08T01:52:55  <janzert> you're only about halfway through the chroot setup btw ;)

2011-05-08T01:57:37  <amstan> janzert: i was thinking of: if version!="natty":   raise Exception("This contest framework was designed to work on Ubuntu Natty(11.04) only.")
2011-05-08T01:58:08  <janzert> sure, put that right at the start of main
2011-05-08T01:58:26  <janzert> then also shove the arch into options
2011-05-08T01:58:37  <amstan> janzert: which options?
2011-05-08T01:58:50  *** nullkuhl <nullkuhl!~nullkuhl@unaffiliated/nullkuhl> has quit IRC (Read error: No route to host)
2011-05-08T01:59:08  <janzert> it's the options object that gets passed around for everything to pull the setup configuration out of

2011-05-08T01:59:46  <janzert> it's called opts in main
2011-05-08T02:01:20  <janzert> so move your get_ubuntu_release_info call to the top of main, throw an exception if not natty and the set opts.arch = ubuntu_arch after the get_options call
2011-05-08T02:01:37  <amstan> ok
2011-05-08T02:01:50  <janzert> but I also thought of a problem since lsb_release isn't in the chroot you'll need to catch that exception
2011-05-08T02:02:27  <janzert> probably just set the version to natty if lsb_release has an error
2011-05-08T02:03:53  <janzert> it'll allow a false positive if run on a distribution without lsb_release but it's going to get pretty intertwined to get everything working correctly otherwise
2011-05-08T02:05:07  <amstan> janzert: the chroot has /etc/lsb-release
2011-05-08T02:05:11  <amstan> so i might change to that..

2011-05-08T02:29:47  <amstan> janzert: do you still want me to do those opt things?
2011-05-08T02:30:40  <janzert> opts is an optparse values object
2011-05-08T02:30:51  <amstan> never worked with them before
2011-05-08T02:30:54  <amstan> can i use it as a dict?
2011-05-08T02:31:27  <janzert> basically for what you're doing just use it like a regular object and set attributes on it
2011-05-08T02:32:04  <amstan> oh, so.. opt.ubuntu_arch, opt_ubuntu_version = check_ubuntu_version()
2011-05-08T02:32:14  <janzert> basically
2011-05-08T02:32:16  <amstan> opt.*
2011-05-08T02:32:42  <janzert> but I think you only need to put the arch into it
2011-05-08T02:32:57  <amstan> what about the bit from worker_setup.py?
2011-05-08T02:33:00  <janzert> just do the version check directly in the main function and raise an exception if it's wrong
2011-05-08T02:33:18  <amstan> i need the version in there..
2011-05-08T02:33:35  <janzert> this is all in worker_setup.py
2011-05-08T02:33:56  <janzert> in the main function first line do version, arch = check_ubuntu_version()
2011-05-08T02:34:14  <janzert> then compare the version to natty and raise exception if not
2011-05-08T02:34:27  <janzert> then call get_options to get the opts object
2011-05-08T02:34:39  <janzert> after that call set opts.ubuntu_arch = arch
2011-05-08T02:35:06  <janzert> then use that in the chroot setup function
2011-05-08T02:35:16  <amstan> yes, but what about %s http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/" % (ubuntu_arch, ubuntu_version, base_chroot_dir,))
2011-05-08T02:35:20  <amstan> it needs ubuntu_version
2011-05-08T02:35:24  <amstan> and that's not in the same scope
2011-05-08T02:35:26  <janzert> hardcode it to natty
2011-05-08T02:35:29  <amstan> aww
2011-05-08T02:35:32  <amstan> after all that work, lol
2011-05-08T02:35:44  <janzert> since that is all everything will work with anyway
2011-05-08T02:36:10  <janzert> if it's anything but natty the sources.list that gets installed will cause problems later on
2011-05-08T02:37:10  <amstan> janzert: well.. i was just wondering if we could not hardcode it to natty there, we already have the exception for that
2011-05-08T02:37:21  <amstan> it's pretty much the same functionality
2011-05-08T02:38:16  <janzert> it makes the code simpler to hardcode it
2011-05-08T02:38:29  <amstan> yeah.. ok
2011-05-08T02:38:31  <janzert> and not hardcoding it just opens up the opportunity for more errors later on

2011-05-08T02:45:32  <amstan> i wanted to install using that..
2011-05-08T02:45:34  <amstan> but..
2011-05-08T02:45:45  <amstan> it somehow tought it was done the base chroot
2011-05-08T02:45:49  <amstan> and now i have a bunch of users
2011-05-08T02:45:57  <amstan> how do i reverse it?
2011-05-08T02:47:15  <amstan> do i just delete the users?
2011-05-08T02:47:27  <amstan> and /srv/chroot again?
2011-05-08T02:49:23  <janzert> yeah
2011-05-08T02:49:39  <janzert> I'm pretty sure that should do it
2011-05-08T02:50:34  <amstan> janzert: oh man.. fstab is full too
2011-05-08T02:51:06  <janzert> oh yeah, if it added the users
2011-05-08T02:52:56  <janzert> that's the really nice thing about ec2 and using a vm for testing, it's very easy to start over fresh again :}
2011-05-08T02:53:27  <amstan> yeah, i would use them if i had access to them

2011-05-08T02:59:29  <amstan> it's options?
2011-05-08T02:59:40  <amstan> i guess
2011-05-08T02:59:43  <amstan> is that the same thing?

2011-05-08T03:09:53  <amstan> i might wait
2011-05-08T03:10:00  <amstan> it's getting java now
2011-05-08T03:10:05  <janzert> yeah it's basically only called opts in main because I was  too lazy to spell it out
2011-05-08T03:10:19  <janzert> you'll see it gets passed down as a parameter to the various functions
2011-05-08T03:10:46  <amstan> yeah, i  s/*/options/g 'd it
2011-05-08T03:11:13  <amstan> i should really stop doing --amends and push -f

2011-05-08T03:12:17  <janzert> actually I don't know what the dependency is that pulls 'em in
2011-05-08T03:12:32  <amstan> we should make a cd
2011-05-08T03:12:39  <amstan> with the contest framework
2011-05-08T03:12:48  <amstan> just install everything from there
2011-05-08T03:12:49  <amstan> lol
2011-05-08T03:12:57  <amstan> it'll have debs too
2011-05-08T03:13:23  <amstan> i really like this sandbox system
2011-05-08T03:13:40  <amstan> you can pretty much try different versions of ubuntu in it, assuming you don't care about drivers
2011-05-08T03:14:09  <amstan> s/ubuntu/anydistro?/g
2011-05-08T03:19:28  <amstan> and now i'm compiling go
2011-05-08T03:20:05  <amstan> we should really get that repo for haskell and the others
2011-05-08T03:20:17  <amstan> just make our own debs with the compiled stuff
2011-05-08T03:24:12  <janzert> yeah, that'd be nice
2011-05-08T03:24:43  <janzert> and yeah I think so long as the distro can use whatever kernel is currently in use you should be able to put it in a chroot
2011-05-08T03:33:47  <amstan> janzert: yay.. it's done
2011-05-08T03:33:59  <janzert> sweet
2011-05-08T03:34:20  <janzert> try running play_one_game and see if it works
2011-05-08T03:35:49  <amstan> janzert: where from?
2011-05-08T03:36:06  <janzert> in the ants directory
2011-05-08T03:36:17  <janzert> it just runs a game with some of the sample bots
2011-05-08T03:36:47  <amstan> it launched w3m on me
2011-05-08T03:37:22  <amstan> contest@aichallengebeta:~/aichallenge/ants$ cat game_logs/0.replay
2011-05-08T03:37:23  <amstan> {"error": "'repo_path'"}
2011-05-08T03:37:45  <janzert> ugh, that must be one of the changes McLeopold made with his recent checkins
2011-05-08T03:37:50  <janzert> the w3m thing that is
2011-05-08T03:38:31  <janzert> hmm, that's a rather unhelpful error
2011-05-08T03:38:49  <janzert> maybe check the repo_path setting in the worker/server_info.py
2011-05-08T03:38:49  <amstan> yeah..
2011-05-08T03:39:17  <janzert> it should be relative to the root_path
2011-05-08T03:39:24  <amstan> "root_path": "/home/contest",
2011-05-08T03:39:25  <janzert> not an absolute path by the way
2011-05-08T03:39:29  <amstan> there's no repo_path
2011-05-08T03:39:48  <janzert> really
2011-05-08T03:40:09  <janzert> in the worker directory?
2011-05-08T03:40:15  <amstan> yeah... that's weird..
2011-05-08T03:40:24  <amstan> should i add it manually?
2011-05-08T03:40:42  <janzert> sure, but also is there one in the template in your setup directory?
2011-05-08T03:40:44  <amstan> the server_info.py file in worker seems to be really skeletal
2011-05-08T03:40:52  <janzert> setup/worker_server_info.py.template
2011-05-08T03:40:54  <amstan> setup has it properly
2011-05-08T03:40:55  <amstan> yeah
2011-05-08T03:41:11  <amstan> should i attempt to fix this?
2011-05-08T03:41:35  * janzert checks to see if a server_info.py got checked in somehow
2011-05-08T03:41:50  <janzert> nope
2011-05-08T03:41:56  <amstan> janzert: i don't dismiss the possibility of me having had that file before
2011-05-08T03:41:59  <janzert> yeah, you could just fix it manually
2011-05-08T03:42:15  <janzert> probably just copy over the template and fill in the values
2011-05-08T03:42:25  <amstan> yeah.. my server_info has stuff like db_username in it
2011-05-08T03:42:39  <amstan> i think it's a manager server_info file
2011-05-08T03:42:41  <janzert> it must be left over from a while ago
2011-05-08T03:42:47  <janzert> ahh, that could be
2011-05-08T03:44:31  <amstan> janzert: play one game is definatelly doing ants stuff now
2011-05-08T03:44:36  <janzert> great
2011-05-08T03:44:41  <amstan> ran about 8 jailusers
2011-05-08T03:44:46  <amstan> and it's turning now..
2011-05-08T03:44:48  <amstan> woot
2011-05-08T03:44:59  <janzert> the sandbox chroots should be working then
2011-05-08T03:45:56  <amstan> k.. wtf? http://hypertriangle.com:13080/visualizer.php?game_id=0
2011-05-08T03:46:54  <amstan> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/ants/games/0/0.replay
2011-05-08T03:47:16  <janzert> heh
2011-05-08T03:47:48  <amstan> ok.. editing it a little
2011-05-08T03:47:56  <janzert> did McLeopold change the replay format in his last batch of checkins?
2011-05-08T03:48:21  <amstan> yay
2011-05-08T03:48:22  <amstan> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/visualizer.php?game_id=0
2011-05-08T03:48:24  <amstan> there we go
2011-05-08T03:48:44  <amstan> and that game was just ran in the sandbox..
2011-05-08T03:48:45  <janzert> yay
2011-05-08T03:48:47  <amstan> cool
2011-05-08T03:49:03  <amstan> so.. bugs discovered today while setting up the sandbox
2011-05-08T03:49:05  <amstan> very few
2011-05-08T03:49:08  <amstan> janzert: good job
2011-05-08T03:49:41  <janzert> well what you did is what I've been doing locally for testing :)
2011-05-08T03:50:17  <amstan> contestbot: later tell mcleopold I have the sandbox ready on the hypertriangle beta server, when you have time we can work on that
2011-05-08T03:50:17  <contestbot> amstan: Ready to serve, my lord.
2011-05-08T03:50:26  <amstan> the only thing i'm affraid now is the sql state..
2011-05-08T03:50:32  <janzert> ?
2011-05-08T03:50:41  <janzert> oh just the overall state of the sql
2011-05-08T03:50:43  <amstan> i have a feeling my schema is out of date
2011-05-08T03:50:47  <amstan> on the server
2011-05-08T03:50:49  <janzert> ahh
2011-05-08T03:51:06  <amstan> and i have no idea what clearing it and reinstalling it would do
2011-05-08T03:51:37  <janzert> the thing I'm dreading right now is that to make it work at all efficiently I've gotta change the way the sandbox class works a bit
2011-05-08T03:51:53  <janzert> for compilation that is
2011-05-08T03:52:20  <amstan> would that be a big problem to change?
2011-05-08T03:52:49  <janzert> not really it's just that I really should change the API of the class and that means I'll need to change the engine to match
2011-05-08T03:52:56  <janzert> I'd rather not touch too much

2011-05-08T12:44:55  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-08T12:45:21  <mcstar> i just saw it among the upgrades and the channel was too quiet
2011-05-08T12:51:02  <Frontier> but it is only bug fixes. I have something else: The company Attachmate took over Novell. This means that most of or the whole team working on the free .NET implementation Mono gets fired.
2011-05-08T12:52:14  <Frontier> About 30 people were working on free .NET and SilverLight implementations there.

2011-05-08T14:09:30  <Frontier> there is a youtube video by someone who found out how you can win the game in a few minutes without actually cheating I think

2011-05-08T14:30:48  <mcstar> thats big
2011-05-08T14:31:18  <mcstar> 5mm?
2011-05-08T14:32:03  <Frontier> I found out what it is: an asian type of lady bug, imported to fight harmful insects in agriculture
2011-05-08T14:32:55  <mcstar> ladybug? the one with the spots?
2011-05-08T14:32:57  <Frontier> It is the larva, so don't twist your brains imagining how this could be a lady bug :p
2011-05-08T14:33:06  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-08T14:33:08  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-08T14:33:16  <Frontier> I found pictures on this german site: http://www.natur-in-nrw.de/HTML/Tiere/Insekten/Kaefer/Cucujoidea/TK-2188.html
2011-05-08T14:34:09  <mcstar> interesting
2011-05-08T14:34:19  <mcstar> ive seen this before
2011-05-08T14:34:21  <McLeopold> Frontier: I made some changes to the visualizer and added some issue to github
2011-05-08T14:34:39  <mcstar> its tiny like i said right?
2011-05-08T14:34:47  <mcstar> approx 5mm?
2011-05-08T14:34:56  <Frontier> McLeopold: That's fine, I'll have a look at it.
2011-05-08T14:35:20  <Frontier> mcstar: yes, a relatively small thing
2011-05-08T14:37:26  <Frontier> ...and ants that protect their aphid farm are probably their biggest enemy (to get back on topic *g*)

2011-05-08T14:38:26  <Frontier> McLeopold: "Visualizer Links" is an open task?
2011-05-08T14:38:44  <McLeopold> Clicking player names does nothing
2011-05-08T14:38:58  <McLeopold> although I didn't put the info into the replay json until yesterday
2011-05-08T14:41:26  <Frontier> McLeopold: The sample replay I had running on my machine had the player names clickable. It has been working since months ;-)
2011-05-08T14:42:16  <Frontier> or check this file in the repo: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/6e8ae9144287300e89f348332c855082331e9f26/ants/visualizer/games/0/2.replay
2011-05-08T14:43:14  <Frontier> I see you replaced the string 'player' with the game id. That's fine.
2011-05-08T14:43:59  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-08T14:44:06  <Frontier> Were the player links added acording to the wiki? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-replay-format
2011-05-08T14:44:33  <McLeopold> yes, except I changed "players" to playernames
2011-05-08T14:46:06  <Frontier> yeah ok, I wasn't 100% confident with that either
2011-05-08T14:46:20  <Frontier> players could be ids or names
2011-05-08T14:47:05  <McLeopold> I think the contrast thing is important
2011-05-08T14:47:10  <McLeopold> I'll play with the links later
2011-05-08T14:47:43  <Frontier> Did you add any filed to the 'local visualizer' that I would add to the build script?
2011-05-08T14:47:54  <Frontier> *files
2011-05-08T14:48:26  <Frontier> (I'm zipping them up for download, although I don't know yet how downloads will be linked into the web site)
2011-05-08T14:49:36  <McLeopold> no
2011-05-08T14:50:59  <Frontier> I stopped documenting my code at some point to get finished ^^, I hope you didn't have a hard time finding your way through.

2011-05-08T15:44:19  <amstan> play_one_game works
2011-05-08T15:44:30  <McLeopold> what about the web?
2011-05-08T15:44:45  <amstan> the game that play_one_game outputs doesn't work in the visualizer
2011-05-08T15:44:49  <amstan> did you change the visualizer?
2011-05-08T15:44:56  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-08T15:44:56  <McLeopold> very little, but yes
2011-05-08T15:45:04  <McLeopold> storageformat should be "json"
2011-05-08T15:45:04  <amstan> something about s/storage/json/g
2011-05-08T15:45:06  <amstan> yeah
2011-05-08T15:45:16  <amstan> i gave the visualizer json, and it didn't like it
2011-05-08T15:45:21  <amstan> maybe i have to rebuild it?
2011-05-08T15:45:21  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-05-08T15:45:24  <McLeopold> oh, yeah
2011-05-08T15:45:31  <McLeopold> I was going directly to the source
2011-05-08T15:45:32  <amstan> ok
2011-05-08T15:46:01  <amstan> McLeopold: also, see this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/387e88c93ec16e304a1add2ad7a8d9c7e6ceece7
2011-05-08T15:46:27  <amstan> thouse things annoyed me greatly yesterday
2011-05-08T15:46:43  <amstan> oh.. right.. your create_test_data still fails
2011-05-08T15:46:47  <amstan> something about duplicate players
2011-05-08T15:54:26  <McLeopold> okay, stuff can move out of sql
2011-05-08T15:55:20  <McLeopold> also, I moved replays to ants/games instead of ants, but I'm not sure I like it
2011-05-08T15:55:32  <McLeopold> I think having ants.ai-contest.com would be better.
2011-05-08T15:55:42  <amstan> McLeopold: why is this important?
2011-05-08T15:55:44  <McLeopold> I want to treat the replays as permalinks
2011-05-08T15:55:55  <McLeopold> so they always work regardless of the contest

2011-05-08T15:58:46  <amstan> Frontier: for that matter, can we get rid of that games folder from ants/visualizer? the format in those replays are out of date
2011-05-08T15:59:17  <amstan> McLeopold: why does play_one_game.sh stop at 100 turns?

2011-05-08T16:03:49  <amstan> McLeopold: have you done any changes on the sql?
2011-05-08T16:03:56  <amstan> i have a feeling the test server is out of date
2011-05-08T16:06:39  <McLeopold> yes
2011-05-08T16:06:47  <McLeopold> the sql files should be up to date
2011-05-08T16:06:59  <amstan> by out of date i mean the database that i have
2011-05-08T16:07:03  <McLeopold> the last change was making game_player mu/sigma field allow nulls
2011-05-08T16:07:10  <McLeopold> idk
2011-05-08T16:07:14  <amstan> so, that's not important
2011-05-08T16:07:31  <McLeopold> I'd drop and recreate
2011-05-08T16:07:36  <amstan> would it break everything if i drop and recreate?
2011-05-08T16:07:51  <McLeopold> well, not for my system, it's part of my testing
2011-05-08T16:08:31  <McLeopold> play_one_game stops at 100 turns because it is meant to be part of the quickstart guide.  play a quick game, see the visualizer, learn how to use playgame.py
2011-05-08T16:08:43  <McLeopold> mom's here, gtg

2011-05-08T16:08:56  <amstan> why does it use the sandbox then?
2011-05-08T16:09:00  * amstan is totally confused
2011-05-08T16:23:23  <Frontier> amstan: the sample replays are there for a quick check if the visualizer works. (I reference the second replay in the build script for testing). I'd like there to be one sample file for reference, but if you would prefer to have no data files in the repo they can be deleted.
2011-05-08T16:24:14  <amstan> why do you need it in the build script though? it's not like it gets copied over
2011-05-08T16:24:19  <Frontier> Well that sounds wrong. The build doesn't depend on the file, it is more of a unit test
2011-05-08T16:26:12  <Frontier> You can type "ant run-visualizer" and see if the build system works and produces a runnable jar file.
2011-05-08T16:26:40  <amstan> with the replay inside?
2011-05-08T16:27:05  <Frontier> no, just there sitting in the games directory on your file system
2011-05-08T16:27:45  <Frontier> Like you write a PDF viewer and keep some sample files around in the repo
2011-05-08T16:28:40  <amstan> so.. what does the build system do with the replay file then? does it copy it? does it reference it in the visualizer?
2011-05-08T16:29:07  <Frontier> it just calls "java -jar visualizer.jar games/0/2.replay" basically
2011-05-08T16:29:17  <amstan> oh
