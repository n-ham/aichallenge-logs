2012-04-19T09:22:55  <mcstar> it works thanks to this code http://hpaste.org/67267
2012-04-19T09:25:33  <mleise> nice physics :)
2012-04-19T09:26:29  <mcstar> if 2 balls collide, they exchange speed, if more than 2, they disappear
2012-04-19T09:26:55  <mcstar> this all sucks, cause balls arent point particles, so sometimes the collision looks awkward
2012-04-19T09:36:03  <amstan> why do they dissapear?
2012-04-19T09:38:47  <mcstar> amstan: because
2012-04-19T09:39:10  <mcstar> i was lazy, and it was easier, than writing down the equations and deal with it
2012-04-19T09:40:32  <mcstar> btw, it is kind of hard to imagine 3 point particles colliding anyway
2012-04-19T09:40:36  <amstan> mcstar: do balls in real life exchange speeds like that?
2012-04-19T09:40:45  <mcstar> in 1 dimension
2012-04-19T09:41:02  <amstan> don't they each go with the speeds they were originally going in the opposite direction?
2012-04-19T09:41:05  <amstan> as if they're hitting a wall
2012-04-19T09:41:07  <mcstar> but since they have finite size, they will behave differently
2012-04-19T09:41:27  <amstan> oh, nvm
2012-04-19T09:41:31  <amstan> the direction changes
2012-04-19T09:41:46  * amstan needs more physics classes
2012-04-19T09:42:13  <mcstar> btw this was meant to be something like an asteroids clone, so objects when collide, whey should disappear anyway
2012-04-19T09:42:37  <mcstar> i just wanted to make it more spectacular for mleise

2012-04-19T09:51:48  <mcstar> nothing
2012-04-19T09:52:35  <mcstar> maybe something
2012-04-19T09:52:43  <aerique> couldn't you have written that in lisp instead of line noise? ;-)
2012-04-19T09:52:48  <mleise> pixel scanning, horrible
2012-04-19T09:52:50  <mcstar> what was the evolution of the asteroids code?
2012-04-19T09:53:21  <mcstar> mleise: i only scan pixels in the intersection of bounding rectangles
2012-04-19T09:53:35  <mcstar> aerique: unfortunately no
2012-04-19T09:53:54  <aerique> another lost soul :-(
2012-04-19T09:54:00  <mcstar> yeah, sorry
2012-04-19T09:54:16  <mcstar> there are many reasons im more into haskell than lisp
2012-04-19T09:54:44  <aerique> anyway, smiley's asteroids is the current engine afaik
2012-04-19T09:55:13  <aerique> he didn't fork it from me, not quite sure where he got it from
2012-04-19T09:55:30  <mcstar> well, it started with you, you did it in i dont know what, then i saw amstan did something in python, and after that smiley in html5
2012-04-19T09:55:54  <mcstar> smiley's engine is in python
2012-04-19T09:56:02  <aerique> amstan and me started both at the same time without knowing about it
2012-04-19T09:56:07  <mcstar> but amstan used pyqt4
2012-04-19T09:56:27  <mcstar> aerique: and what did you write it in?
2012-04-19T09:56:29  <aerique> smiley came later but his is the most mature
2012-04-19T09:56:44  <aerique> mcstar: i adapted the ants engine so in python
2012-04-19T09:56:57  <mcstar> and how did you visualize?
2012-04-19T09:57:01  <aerique> not that i had much experience with it
2012-04-19T09:57:51  <aerique> the engine wrote out the game state and i had a script that converted each round to a png.  all pngs got converted to an avi
2012-04-19T09:57:57  <aerique> kinda convoluted ;-)
2012-04-19T09:59:01  <mcstar> aerique: do you have the links to the video?

2012-04-19T10:11:55  <rwest> I have gone down the route of I'll write the physics from scratch
2012-04-19T10:12:02  <rwest> 2 weeks later
2012-04-19T10:12:11  <rwest> I had imported a nice box2d library
2012-04-19T10:14:10  <mcstar> rwest: asteroids doesnt need a full physics engine
2012-04-19T10:14:43  <rwest> better change that then!
2012-04-19T10:16:28  <mleise> mcstar: how does one test the performance of the Asteroids program?
2012-04-19T10:16:46  * mcstar shrugs
2012-04-19T10:16:50  <mleise> It's full of Cairo drawing and renders at a fixed frame rate, lol
2012-04-19T10:17:09  <mcstar> you up the rate
2012-04-19T10:17:25  <mleise> but obviously the test field changes :p
2012-04-19T10:17:26  <mcstar> if it becomes sluggish, then it means you are demanding too much
2012-04-19T10:17:35  <mcstar> you averae
2012-04-19T10:17:39  <mcstar> average*
2012-04-19T10:17:48  <mleise> the ships and rocks vanish after few milliseconds
2012-04-19T10:18:05  <mleise> how can you reliably measure anything under these circumstances
2012-04-19T10:18:16  <mcstar> you tell them to pass each other
2012-04-19T10:18:28  <mcstar> ok?
2012-04-19T10:18:30  <mleise> ok
2012-04-19T10:18:40  <mcstar> are you talking about my code?
2012-04-19T10:18:52  <mcstar> or did you finish the rewrite?
2012-04-19T10:19:02  <mleise> sure, so simply removing the last step (removing dead objects from the list) should do it
2012-04-19T10:19:15  <mleise> I finished ... well I have a rewrite
2012-04-19T10:19:30  <mleise> now i need to compile gtkd for GDC
2012-04-19T10:19:37  <mcstar> there is a part, when i take a set difference
2012-04-19T10:19:50  <mcstar> if you dont do that it will be ok
2012-04-19T10:19:53  <mleise> so i can run it with the outdated GCC implementation of D
2012-04-19T10:19:53  <mcstar> i think
2012-04-19T10:20:14  <mcstar> i dont know what you are talking about
2012-04-19T10:20:24  <mcstar> D doesnt have its own compiler?
2012-04-19T10:20:32  <mcstar> i mean to machine code
2012-04-19T10:20:33  <mleise> Yes, but it sucks
2012-04-19T10:20:49  <mleise> It is the reference, but the backend isn't good at optimization
2012-04-19T10:21:35  <mleise> So the frontend was glued onto GCC which works much better, but I have to rebuild the static libraries for it now.
2012-04-19T10:21:46  <mleise> since the runtime is different between both compilers
2012-04-19T10:21:55  <mleise> its like MSVC or GCC on Windows
2012-04-19T10:22:13  <mcstar> mleise: if you comment out the writeIORef line, it will do the work, but will leave objects on screen
2012-04-19T10:22:16  <mleise> Haskell only has one compiler that is widely used?
2012-04-19T10:22:29  <mleise> mcstar: thx Ill do that
2012-04-19T10:22:48  <mcstar> far the most used one is GHC
2012-04-19T10:22:56  <mleise> and if i set the timer to 1 ms I'll have some fun
2012-04-19T10:23:13  <mcstar> ghc has llvm backend, and asm
2012-04-19T10:23:19  <mcstar> im not sure about C
2012-04-19T10:23:35  <mcstar> it could generate code via C, maybe it still does
2012-04-19T10:23:49  <mleise> yeah these projects are fun
2012-04-19T10:23:56  <mleise> there is a D to JavaScript compiler as well
2012-04-19T10:25:44  <mcstar> mleise: 1ms looks fine here
2012-04-19T10:25:51  <mleise> Oo
2012-04-19T10:26:17  <mcstar> also, Xorg eats 1 core up
2012-04-19T10:26:25  <mcstar> there is something wrong with my X

2012-04-19T10:27:06  <mleise> mcstar: maybe your copy from the Drawable to the Pixbuf slows X down
2012-04-19T10:27:12  <mcstar> no
2012-04-19T10:27:21  <mcstar> i hibernate all the time
2012-04-19T10:27:29  <mcstar> and after a while, X becomes slow
2012-04-19T10:27:41  <mleise> that sucks
2012-04-19T10:27:53  <mcstar> (not that i would notice, but glxgears for example has like 3-5 fps fullscreen)
2012-04-19T10:27:54  <mleise> I reboot now and then

2012-04-19T10:40:39  <mleise> first stop Xorg.0.log
2012-04-19T10:40:50  <mleise> glxinfo, driinfo
2012-04-19T10:41:01  <mcstar> it says i have direct rendering
2012-04-19T10:41:30  <mleise> I did that a few times. Just ressurected an old IBM to connect it to the receiver and TV
2012-04-19T10:41:42  <mleise> so what is up with your OpenGL driver?
2012-04-19T10:42:11  <mleise> DRI means the drivers have kernel support for some ... fast stuff I don't really understand anyway
2012-04-19T10:42:40  <mleise> So there is kernel/DRI, the Xorg driver and the OpenGL driver as far as I understand it
2012-04-19T10:43:09  <mleise> all with their own hardware specialized contribution to the gfx card
2012-04-19T10:43:42  <mleise> do you use binary drivers from nVidia?
2012-04-19T10:43:54  <mleise> they are usually painless
2012-04-19T10:44:26  <mcstar> ofc
2012-04-19T10:44:31  <mcstar> everything is loaded, no errors
2012-04-19T10:45:24  <mleise> no errors? ok. then your card is *really* slow :p
2012-04-19T10:46:08  <mleise> If it's only OpenGL then maybe the wrong driver is loaded
2012-04-19T10:46:16  <mcstar> something definitely happened to my 3d accel
2012-04-19T10:46:20  <mcstar> no
2012-04-19T10:46:21  <mcstar> i can read
2012-04-19T10:46:28  <mleise> although ... even a software driver is faster

2012-04-19T12:35:53  <thestinger> pairofdice: btw a neat trick from the first crypto-class assignment is that XORing with a space flips the case of regular ascii characters
2012-04-19T12:36:08  <pairofdice> oh, cool
2012-04-19T12:36:13  <thestinger> useful for verifying your findings from other methods
2012-04-19T12:36:40  <pairofdice> what does xoring a space with space do
2012-04-19T12:36:55  <thestinger> well, the value of space is 32
2012-04-19T12:37:02  <thestinger> so it flips the 32nd bit
2012-04-19T12:37:12  <thestinger> which is the difference between lowercase ascii chars and uppercase ones
2012-04-19T12:37:33  <thestinger> 'a' ^ ' ' == 'A'
2012-04-19T12:37:37  <thestinger> 'A' ^ ' ' == 'a'
2012-04-19T12:37:37  <pairofdice> ye
2012-04-19T12:37:39  <thestinger> etc.
2012-04-19T12:47:10  <delt0r__> pairofdice: xor of a value against its own value is always zero
2012-04-19T12:47:20  <delt0r__> or where you trying to be funny?
2012-04-19T12:47:26  <pairofdice> Right, stupid me

2012-04-19T14:33:39  <mleise> You'd need to download gtkD and a compiler, but to have good results, you should use GDC. Is that available in your distribution?

2012-04-19T15:21:26  <mcstar> do you mean this pixbuf?
2012-04-19T15:21:31  <mleise> yep
2012-04-19T15:21:34  <mcstar> or th ebig one?
2012-04-19T15:21:36  <mcstar> ah
2012-04-19T15:21:42  <mleise> no the 10000000000 small ones
2012-04-19T15:21:45  <mcstar> but these are really tiny ones
2012-04-19T15:22:03  <mcstar> they add up eventually
2012-04-19T15:22:03  <mleise> they aren't so cute when they clutter up your ram
2012-04-19T15:22:43  <mcstar> mleise: i dont think i got an answer, is D gc'd or not?
2012-04-19T15:22:52  <mleise> yes, it is
2012-04-19T15:23:28  <mcstar> maybe the gtk runtime holds onto the pixbufs
2012-04-19T15:24:01  <mcstar> mleise: it wouldnt be hard to do without them
2012-04-19T15:24:06  <mleise> maybe, but don't expect a GC to see that 'foreign' memory
2012-04-19T15:24:41  <mleise> it may believe that it doesn't need to collect any garbage when there is a lot of external memory in use through wrapper objects
2012-04-19T15:24:54  <mleise> without pixbufs?
2012-04-19T15:25:04  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-19T15:25:10  <mleise> no, cairo offers the functions to do intersection tests
2012-04-19T15:25:11  <mcstar> it was just convenience
2012-04-19T15:25:20  <mcstar> really?
2012-04-19T15:25:30  <mleise> i hope so :p
2012-04-19T15:25:31  <mcstar> i wrote it in a hurry
2012-04-19T15:25:49  <mleise> I used quite a lot of convenience functions in my DebugPainter for ants
2012-04-19T15:25:56  <mcstar> i just meant, that all those little pixbufs could be eliminated, by reading from only 1 pixbuf, that holds the whole screen
2012-04-19T15:25:59  <mleise> like measuring the bounding box of a path
2012-04-19T15:26:03  <thestinger> mcstar: I think it's more a resource leak than a simple memory leak
2012-04-19T15:26:33  <mcstar> thestinger: explain
2012-04-19T15:27:01  <thestinger> mcstar: well, GC takes care of memory but not things like file descriptors and other resources
2012-04-19T15:27:16  <thestinger> I'm sure there's a way to deal with it automatically in haskell though
2012-04-19T15:27:22  <mcstar> but there is no way to 'close' a pixbuf
2012-04-19T15:27:31  <thestinger> oh
2012-04-19T15:28:10  <thestinger> mcstar: do you have to delete them from wherever you had them render? (I have no idea how cairo works)
2012-04-19T15:28:32  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2012-04-19T15:28:40  <mcstar> i dont even render them
2012-04-19T15:28:52  <mcstar> it is a copy of a rendered region of a drawablke
2012-04-19T15:28:56  <mcstar> drawable
2012-04-19T15:29:04  <mcstar> (meaning something you can paint on)
2012-04-19T15:29:22  <mcstar> but there is no connection between them, other than an initial copy
2012-04-19T15:29:26  <mleise> g_object_unref(pix); worked like a charm for me
2012-04-19T15:29:52  <mcstar> mleise: ill try to kill my code
2012-04-19T15:29:53  <mleise> that was resorting to pure C though
2012-04-19T15:30:31  <mleise> I did try to destroy the wrapper object before, but it didn't work
2012-04-19T15:30:44  <mleise> so it was back to the roots for me
2012-04-19T15:32:02  <mcstar> mleise: haha, X had 4.8GB resource memory
2012-04-19T15:32:21  <thestinger> xrestop?
2012-04-19T15:32:44  <mcstar> hm?
2012-04-19T15:32:45  <mleise> mcstar: one more thing, it may be unimportant, but on exit your code sometimes complains. maybe the timer is firing when the window is already closed?
2012-04-19T15:33:09  <mcstar> asteroids: user error (widgetGetDrawWindow: no DrawWindow available (the widget is probably not realized)
2012-04-19T15:33:12  <mcstar> this ^^?
2012-04-19T15:33:18  <mleise> yes!
2012-04-19T15:33:28  <mcstar> i can say this: whatever
2012-04-19T15:33:44  <mcstar> sry, i dont care about gtk stuff much
2012-04-19T15:33:55  <mcstar> that part of the code is from a gtk2hs tutorial
2012-04-19T15:34:03  <mcstar> (which makes the window, and quits it)
2012-04-19T15:39:32  <mleise> rofl, 25% time spent in nvidia_drv.so
2012-04-19T15:40:13  <mleise> the rest in xorg, pixman, libc...
2012-04-19T15:40:57  <mleise> even my network driver has done more than my program
2012-04-19T15:41:40  <mleise> i guess the profiler has a bug
2012-04-19T15:42:42  <mcstar> :)
2012-04-19T15:43:10  <mcstar> mleise: seems, that D is efficient after all
2012-04-19T15:43:33  <mleise> in doing nothing?
2012-04-19T15:45:58  <mleise> The top entry: 0.0903%  main.d:262 bool main.checkBuffer(ref const(main.RGB), ref const(main.RGB), gtkc.gdktypes.GdkPixbuf*)
2012-04-19T15:47:21  <mleise> I'll sleep over this and maybe learn me some cairo and gtk on the way
2012-04-19T15:48:33  <mcstar> maybe..
2012-04-19T15:49:03  <mcstar> in the meantime, this gdc still builds
2012-04-19T15:54:23  <mleise> i know :)
2012-04-19T15:54:37  <mleise> well it is a good sign, isn't it?
2012-04-19T15:56:18  <mcstar> couldnt be better
2012-04-19T15:56:28  <mcstar> well, except having a binary package...
2012-04-19T15:56:48  <amstan> i'm torn
2012-04-19T15:57:01  <mcstar> whats up?
2012-04-19T15:57:20  <amstan> idk what i should use for my interface thingy, pyside+qwt(somehow), pyqt+qwt, pyside+matplotlib, or pyside+something of my own built
2012-04-19T15:57:24  <amstan> i need graphs
2012-04-19T15:57:36  <mcstar> what kind?
2012-04-19T15:57:42  <mcstar> i have a simple kind
2012-04-19T15:58:06  <mcstar> but thats in c++, i always forget you do python
2012-04-19T15:58:38  <mcstar> i read somewhere theres not much difference i pyside and pyqt api
2012-04-19T15:58:44  <amstan> it'll be complicated
2012-04-19T15:58:51  <amstan> and it might be commercial, so pyqt might be out
2012-04-19T15:58:53  <thestinger> amstan: matplotlib is awesome
2012-04-19T15:59:00  <mcstar> it is slow
2012-04-19T15:59:03  <amstan> thestinger: one thing i noticed though: it's slow
2012-04-19T15:59:10  <amstan> if i want any animation i get like 4fps
2012-04-19T15:59:20  <amstan> i want to display data as i get it
2012-04-19T15:59:34  <thestinger> oh, yeah
2012-04-19T15:59:38  <thestinger> it sucks for real-time graphs
2012-04-19T15:59:39  <amstan> thestinger: i do like that i can integrate it in pyqt/pyside though
2012-04-19T16:00:00  <thestinger> might be able to fix that though
2012-04-19T16:00:00  <amstan> and pyside+qwt doesn't really exist, there's a project for it but it looks abandoned
2012-04-19T16:00:06  <thestinger> by default it makes fancy vector graphics
2012-04-19T16:00:14  <amstan> but i want the fancy vector stuff too
2012-04-19T16:00:36  <amstan> i implemented my own graph for pyqt in another project and it's pretty and fast at the same time
2012-04-19T16:00:40  <mcstar> amstan: i just wrote my plotting widget
2012-04-19T16:00:52  <mcstar> it isnt hard, am not sure what do you need
2012-04-19T16:00:53  <amstan> not to mention that i can make it qt interactive too
2012-04-19T16:01:15  <amstan> mcstar: i'm building a UI for an electrophoresis device
2012-04-19T16:01:37  <amstan> it'll have 96 cells, each cell having like 3 graphs(live) each
2012-04-19T16:01:47  <amstan> so it's a pretty big project, not something i can just throw together
2012-04-19T16:02:03  <mcstar> 96x3 real time graphs?
2012-04-19T16:02:10  <amstan> not on the same screen
2012-04-19T16:02:12  <mcstar> all on one screen?
2012-04-19T16:02:16  <mcstar> i see
2012-04-19T16:02:23  <mcstar> still, it is helluvalot
2012-04-19T16:02:33  <amstan> anyone try qwt?
2012-04-19T16:05:29  <mcstar> amstan: have you considered c++ and pure qt?
2012-04-19T16:05:40  <amstan> that sounds kinda scary
2012-04-19T16:05:49  <rwest> python is scary!
2012-04-19T16:05:59  <amstan> i also want to do serial interaction with my device
2012-04-19T16:06:16  <mcstar> amstan: we dropped serial in favor of libusb
2012-04-19T16:06:25  <mcstar> it is better
2012-04-19T16:06:27  <mcstar> imho
2012-04-19T16:06:32  <amstan> mcstar: except my device is serial
2012-04-19T16:06:39  <amstan> for now
2012-04-19T16:06:55  <mcstar> really serial, or just emulates it?
2012-04-19T16:07:06  <amstan> for now really serial
2012-04-19T16:07:47  <mcstar> i wrote a wrapper class on top of boost asio, now it is in the wastebin
2012-04-19T16:08:46  <amstan> i really liked how easy was to make the python stuff cross platform
2012-04-19T16:09:04  <mcstar> amstan: you do asynchron io, right?
2012-04-19T16:09:08  <mcstar> just checking
2012-04-19T16:09:17  <amstan> yes
2012-04-19T16:09:55  <mcstar> amstan: i had no problem building boost and my project on win7
2012-04-19T16:10:31  <amstan> i don't feel like c++ though, i want to easily develop this UI thing and even use it during debugging for the device
2012-04-19T16:11:22  <amstan> and even if i do switch to c++, i'll still have the same problem
2012-04-19T16:11:28  <amstan> what should i do about graphing stuff
2012-04-19T16:13:11  <mcstar> you need to decide between qwt or roll your own
2012-04-19T16:13:49  <rwest> amstan: use an html5 library
2012-04-19T16:13:55  <mcstar> bleh
2012-04-19T16:14:07  <amstan> rwest: and how should i access the serial device?
2012-04-19T16:14:07  <rwest> can make nice live graphs that run easily
2012-04-19T16:14:16  <mcstar> rwest: not everyone is web developer
2012-04-19T16:14:33  <thestinger> rwest: he has speed issues with matplotlib, canvas will be worse
2012-04-19T16:14:41  <rwest> you don't have to use a web language to get them
2012-04-19T16:14:54  <rwest> thestinger: oh, didn't read the whole thing
2012-04-19T16:15:39  <thestinger> he wants to do real-time graphing
2012-04-19T16:15:43  <amstan> rwest: so then i need to make a python or c++ aberation that includes a html5 rendering engine
2012-04-19T16:15:53  <mcstar> qtwebkit
2012-04-19T16:15:57  <amstan> thestinger: well.. javascript
2012-04-19T16:16:08  <mcstar> anyway, this is nonsense, excuse me
2012-04-19T16:16:13  <mcstar> just pick qwt and be happy
2012-04-19T16:16:18  <rwest> amstan: see this is where the nice part would come in, you find one that takes the data in json or xml and you just output it
2012-04-19T16:16:22  <amstan> except no pyside qwt bindings
2012-04-19T16:16:25  <amstan> that i could compile
2012-04-19T16:16:35  <mcstar> what is wrong with pyqt?
2012-04-19T16:16:44  <rwest> but if you have speed troubles natively, it won't help heh
2012-04-19T16:17:09  <thestinger> mcstar: the whole non-commercial thing I think he said
2012-04-19T16:17:16  <amstan> mcstar: gpl only, pyside is lgpl
2012-04-19T16:17:23  <amstan> mcstar: it's a commercial thing
2012-04-19T16:17:33  <thestinger> fuck cling
2012-04-19T16:17:36  <thestinger> I can never get it to build
2012-04-19T16:17:52  <thestinger> svn: E155007: '/home/strcat/packages/cling-svn/src/llvm-build/tools/cling/lib/UserInterface' is not a working copy

2012-04-19T16:17:57  <mcstar> amstan: you would need to free the source?
2012-04-19T16:17:58  <amstan> mcstar: also, the pyqwt stuff is outdated(uses qwt5 not qwt6)
2012-04-19T16:18:03  <amstan> mcstar: yep
2012-04-19T16:18:20  <mcstar> whats the licence of the real qwt?
2012-04-19T16:18:22  <amstan> which i'm not opposed to, but my employer might be
2012-04-19T16:18:26  <mcstar> i think thers even  commercial edition
2012-04-19T16:18:41  <mcstar> there is some plotting lib, that uses qwt
2012-04-19T16:18:53  <mcstar> and it is commercial
2012-04-19T16:19:11  <mcstar> amstan: i suggest you do it in c++ with qwt
2012-04-19T16:19:20  <mcstar> feel free to ignore me XD
2012-04-19T16:19:37  <amstan> yes, but do i even need qwt? that's the question
2012-04-19T16:19:39  <mcstar> mleise: gdc is built!
2012-04-19T16:19:54  <amstan> is it fun to use? i only need a bunch of graphs
2012-04-19T16:19:56  <mcstar> if you are unsure that you can make those graphs
2012-04-19T16:20:21  <mcstar> i dont think you will be writing more than a couple hundred lines per graph
2012-04-19T16:20:24  <amstan> i can make them, but i'm affraid the code will get ugly by making my own stuff
2012-04-19T16:20:26  <mcstar> 200
2012-04-19T16:20:59  <amstan> k, time to go home
