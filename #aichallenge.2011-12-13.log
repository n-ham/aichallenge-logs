2011-12-13T01:22:44  <memolicious> i have a completely noobish question regarding distance calculation.
2011-12-13T01:23:08  <dragonfyre13> memolicious: k
2011-12-13T01:23:15  <dragonfyre13> I'm on, let's see if I can answer
2011-12-13T01:23:44  <memolicious> when i compare the result of the included distance function against a provided radius, say attackradius, do I use the squarert of the attackradius?
2011-12-13T01:23:55  <memolicious> or is the distance function squaring the result and I compare directly?
2011-12-13T01:24:08  <dragonfyre13> and memolicious, for future reference (IDK if it applies to this room) there's a standing IRC meme. "Don't ask if you can ask a question, or say you're going to ask a question. Just ask the question" ^_^
2011-12-13T01:24:30  <memolicious> At dragonfyre13 yeah I realized I totally blew that haha.
2011-12-13T01:24:38  <dragonfyre13> yes, sqrt of attackradius
2011-12-13T01:24:58  <dragonfyre13> waiit.
2011-12-13T01:25:01  <dragonfyre13> hangon
2011-12-13T01:25:03  <memolicious> hehe
2011-12-13T01:25:08  <memolicious> waiting
2011-12-13T01:25:10  <dragonfyre13> yeah, that's right
2011-12-13T01:25:14  <dragonfyre13> wanted to make sure
2011-12-13T01:25:41  <memolicious> thanks :)
2011-12-13T01:25:42  <dragonfyre13> Though I think that only works if it's manhatten distance
2011-12-13T01:25:55  <memolicious> eh?
2011-12-13T01:26:06  <dragonfyre13> travel
2011-12-13T01:26:36  <dragonfyre13> basically, if you're moving in a straight line
2011-12-13T01:26:39  <memolicious> the distance function i am referring to is the one documented on the site, the Euclidean metric I believe.
2011-12-13T01:26:46  <dragonfyre13> k, hangon
2011-12-13T01:26:53  <dragonfyre13> in the python starter pack, or no?
2011-12-13T01:26:53  <memolicious> right - which is what you need to determine something like attack range
2011-12-13T01:26:57  <dragonfyre13> that's the one I was looking at
2011-12-13T01:27:02  <memolicious> mine is the JavaScript start pack actually =)
2011-12-13T01:27:05  <dragonfyre13> ah
2011-12-13T01:27:07  <dragonfyre13> hangon
2011-12-13T01:27:10  <memolicious> k
2011-12-13T01:27:30  <memolicious> it matches the euclidean metric function described on the site so i assume its the same (well - should be)
2011-12-13T01:28:13  <dragonfyre13> ah yea
2011-12-13T01:28:17  <dragonfyre13> k
2011-12-13T01:28:44  <memolicious> so, if ants.distance <= sqrt(attackradius2) then its w/in attack range, yeah?
2011-12-13T01:29:05  <dragonfyre13> so you need to compare sqrt(attackradius2) >= distance(loc1,loc2)
2011-12-13T01:29:14  <dragonfyre13> yep
2011-12-13T01:29:16  <memolicious> yeah
2011-12-13T01:29:17  <memolicious> cool
2011-12-13T01:29:17  <dragonfyre13> that's the ticket

2011-12-13T02:54:13  <BenJackson> haha that demonstrates my "anti timeout" code
2011-12-13T02:54:32  <BenJackson> got 250 ants?  ok, time for the WWI style charges across no-mans-land
2011-12-13T02:55:14  <BenJackson> you can see in the graph where I hit 25o and blue takes a nosedive
2011-12-13T02:56:33  <thestinger> BenJackson: that's a great way to deal with timeouts xD
2011-12-13T02:56:48  <thestinger> if I have 500 ants, I'll just skip doing combat completely
2011-12-13T02:57:02  <thestinger> and then it will kick back in when a few die :P
2011-12-13T02:58:28  <BenJackson> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.29837
2011-12-13T02:58:33  <BenJackson> that one is interesting if you center on blue
2011-12-13T02:58:39  <BenJackson> initially I do well to keep orange clear
2011-12-13T02:58:47  <BenJackson> then suddenly it's ant soup as I fail to hold any lines
2011-12-13T02:58:54  <BenJackson> then I clear it out again
2011-12-13T02:58:55  <antimatroid1> i like that symmetry detection hasn't been very worthwhile
2011-12-13T02:59:29  <antimatroid1> thestinger: you could at least have them all just make their offensive or defensive moves
2011-12-13T02:59:38  <antimatroid1> ie. move the ants out of the most dangerous squares at least
2011-12-13T02:59:45  <thestinger> well, if I disable combat they're just going to charge at the enemy
2011-12-13T03:00:04  <antimatroid1> yeah, but you could be a little smarter about it imo
2011-12-13T03:00:06  <thestinger> I do all my movement and end up with an orders hash table, and then run combat
2011-12-13T03:00:19  <thestinger> well, I could handle way more than 500 ants now :P
2011-12-13T03:00:30  <thestinger> my last bot had a single timeout on the server, with around 550 ants
2011-12-13T03:00:38  <thestinger> and it did combat globally (simulation for the whole map)
2011-12-13T03:00:50  <antimatroid1> hmmm
2011-12-13T03:00:58  <antimatroid1> i tell mine to stop when it runs out of time
2011-12-13T03:01:10  <antimatroid1> and tell it to use up to 50% of the time on combat
2011-12-13T03:01:18  <thestinger> I used to do that, but the calls to gettimeofday() were the bottleneck
2011-12-13T03:01:22  <antimatroid1> and do that first before anything else
2011-12-13T03:01:28  <thestinger> so I would have to put it in the outer loop where it wouldn't really catch anything
2011-12-13T03:01:30  <antimatroid1> yeah i have considered that
2011-12-13T03:01:36  <BenJackson> gettimeofday is actually very cheap
2011-12-13T03:01:38  <BenJackson> on modern linux
2011-12-13T03:01:39  <antimatroid1> but you can always just check after each battle partition has run
2011-12-13T03:01:47  <thestinger> BenJackson: not in an inner loop
2011-12-13T03:01:53  <BenJackson> could be -pg distorting your results
2011-12-13T03:01:58  <BenJackson> thestinger: it's not even a system call
2011-12-13T03:02:05  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-13T03:02:13  <thestinger> well, the profiler screwed up I guess :\
2011-12-13T03:02:39  <BenJackson> really tiny inner-loop functions are greatly distorted on -pg

2011-12-13T03:46:04  <antimatroid1> a.*
2011-12-13T03:46:04  <antimatroid1> **.
2011-12-13T03:46:08  <antimatroid1> you want to go west
2011-12-13T03:46:13  <antimatroid1> east sorry
2011-12-13T03:46:34  <antimatroid1> when you search from food it's hard to do that
2011-12-13T03:47:03  <McLeopold> a..*
2011-12-13T03:47:04  <antimatroid1> i order search items by the number of food items the path is going to collect for longer paths, but that first one is hard to do
2011-12-13T03:47:06  <McLeopold> *.*.
2011-12-13T03:47:28  <antimatroid1> i would just collect the 1 then
2011-12-13T03:47:51  <antimatroid1> but for equal length paths i want to collect the maximal number of food first
2011-12-13T03:48:11  <McLeopold> oh, so "hold" is a length of 1
2011-12-13T03:48:30  <antimatroid1> yeah, the ant will be available to move again in 1 turn
2011-12-13T03:48:38  <antimatroid1> so it's the same as moving into an adjacent square
2011-12-13T03:53:53  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: any ideas on how to handle that edge case?
2011-12-13T03:54:56  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I'm not sure how you score path, so no
2011-12-13T03:55:46  <antimatroid1> i just realised i'm unecessarily using a priority queue for the entire search
2011-12-13T03:55:49  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: do you search from food to ants?
2011-12-13T03:56:08  <antimatroid1> i just need to use a priority queue when i add the squares adjacent to food, then i can whack it all into a queue
2011-12-13T03:56:49  <McLeopold> yeah, if you search from food, both squares should be hit at the same time
2011-12-13T03:57:11  <McLeopold> then the square with 2 foods should be the higher priority
2011-12-13T03:57:12  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: yeah, iteratively (ordered) bfs from uncollected food to moveable ants, and move the best found move once it's pathlength + time ant is available is less than the current search item pulled off the queue's current path length
2011-12-13T03:57:44  <antimatroid1> so it would find the food adjacent to the ant and move it before it got on to searching from squares adjacent to food
2011-12-13T03:57:52  <antimatroid1> ant adjacent to food*
2011-12-13T03:58:19  <antimatroid1> otherwise i can call off the search when i do because i order the search items right up so it searches from locations with the most adjacent food first
2011-12-13T03:59:09  <McLeopold> my bfs would have produced both moves at the same time in a list
2011-12-13T03:59:38  <McLeopold> but I don't track if a square has more than one food it will collect
2011-12-13T04:00:52  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I want to make my bfs faster, but I can't think how
2011-12-13T04:01:15  <antimatroid1> my bfs's are all slightly different
2011-12-13T04:01:19  <antimatroid1> some are ordered, some aren't etc.
2011-12-13T04:01:20  <McLeopold> if I were to search from food to ant, I could just create a matrix of distances and pick a move that minimizes it
2011-12-13T04:01:34  <antimatroid1> but then once you collect a food item the information changes
2011-12-13T04:01:44  <McLeopold> but if I search from ant to food, I have to propogate information on the path
2011-12-13T04:02:07  <antimatroid1> i think you want to iteratively collect food at the very least
2011-12-13T04:02:15  <McLeopold> I can create a matrix of ant to all food, but it doesn't tell me where to go
2011-12-13T04:02:17  <antimatroid1> like others have said, there's usually not that much food to collect
2011-12-13T04:02:54  <McLeopold> any ideas for that?

2011-12-13T04:05:55  <antimatroid1> you can trace from food back to ants though?
2011-12-13T04:06:05  <antimatroid1> you just have to retrace the shortest paths
2011-12-13T04:06:23  <antimatroid1> not sure about implications with reusing ants

2011-12-13T04:06:59  <antimatroid1> same problem as before, the information changes every time you move an ant
2011-12-13T04:07:20  <McLeopold> I just do a bfs from each food individually
2011-12-13T04:07:51  <McLeopold> actually, I can't think why I would ever start a search from an ant?

2011-12-13T04:08:40  <Fluxid> aw carp, i started my bot on tcp but forgot to disable debugging... it takes over 1s now, ff
2011-12-13T04:08:43  <antimatroid1> don't have a set of targets, but can check a location to see if it's a target?
2011-12-13T04:09:39  <antimatroid1> i don't think i'm doing that anymore though
2011-12-13T04:09:44  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: does that answer why I would search from an ant?
2011-12-13T04:10:07  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: well otherwise you have to go through every square and add the targets to a set/vector
2011-12-13T04:10:26  <antimatroid1> otherwise how else would you search from the targets?
2011-12-13T04:10:57  <McLeopold> that's kinda what I do
2011-12-13T04:10:58  <Fluxid> fixed, sorry
2011-12-13T04:11:08  <McLeopold> This is all in python
2011-12-13T04:11:17  <McLeopold> I'm not really going for speed, persay
2011-12-13T04:11:33  <antimatroid1> my target sets consist of things like uncollectedFood, unseenBorder, potentialEnemyBorder, notRecentlySeenBorder, enemyAnys, enemyHills, etc.
2011-12-13T04:11:59  <antimatroid1> i only reuse ants for collecting food though
2011-12-13T04:12:11  <antimatroid1> and maybe for exploration, but i'm not atm
2011-12-13T04:12:22  *** vjacob <vjacob!~vjacob@94-195-174-165.zone9.bethere.co.uk> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-13T04:12:34  <antimatroid1> and only if the ant can't possibly be battled on it's path to the food
2011-12-13T04:13:27  <McLeopold> hmm, I'll try the matrix thing and see how it goes...
2011-12-13T04:13:41  <antimatroid1> how are you going to update the information?
2011-12-13T04:14:10  <antimatroid1> you have to use a bfs to generate the initial information
2011-12-13T04:14:20  <antimatroid1> and a bfs every time you collect food/move an ant to update it
2011-12-13T04:14:30  <antimatroid1> i think it's just easier to bfs from the food to ants and move them
2011-12-13T04:14:48  <McLeopold> I do a separate bfs from every food item
2011-12-13T04:15:04  <antimatroid1> do it from all food
2011-12-13T04:15:14  <antimatroid1> and just do a new search every time you collect a food item
2011-12-13T04:15:21  <McLeopold> right, 1 whole matrix for each food
2011-12-13T04:15:32  <antimatroid1> but why?
2011-12-13T04:15:42  <McLeopold> why not?
2011-12-13T04:15:53  <antimatroid1> you at least only need to do each matrix until F ants have been seen, where F is the number of food items
2011-12-13T04:16:15  <antimatroid1> because then you have sufficient information even if each food is collected by a unique ant
2011-12-13T04:16:38  <antimatroid1> but if you're doing that, why not just do simultaneous bfs's?
2011-12-13T04:16:59  <antimatroid1> ie. have 1 search queue but a vector of searchedMatrices
2011-12-13T04:17:27  <antimatroid1> the search items will need to mark which food item they're collecting
2011-12-13T04:17:49  <McLeopold> if I searched from all food at once, every ant would go to the closest food
2011-12-13T04:17:59  <antimatroid1> it's a pita to reuse ants that way fyi, you have to start assigning ant ids to locations
2011-12-13T04:18:13  <antimatroid1> no, do a simultaneous bfs
2011-12-13T04:18:36  <McLeopold> which is what?
2011-12-13T04:18:36  <antimatroid1> so do all bfs's at once, and if you pull a search item off where the "food target" has already been collected, just keep searching and ignore that
2011-12-13T04:19:21  <antimatroid1> like have, queue<FoodSearchItem> searchQueue and vector<Matrix<bool> > searched(food.size(), Matrix<bool>(rows, cols, 0))
2011-12-13T04:21:13  <McLeopold> * _ _ a _ _ b _|_ _ _ _ _ _ _  *  (| is the halfway mark)
2011-12-13T04:21:28  <McLeopold> both a and b are closer to the left
2011-12-13T04:21:54  <McLeopold> if I add both targets to the bfs, b will find the left 1 first
2011-12-13T04:22:27  <antimatroid1> yes, but once you collect the left * with a, once you pull any more search items off with target as left * you don't search further, and the search queue has search items for the right * over the left * because you have multiple searched matrices
2011-12-13T04:23:31  <antimatroid1> so basically once you do searchItem = searchQueue.front(), if(!uncollectedFood.count(searchItem.fLoc)) continue;
2011-12-13T04:23:34  <McLeopold> so then, remove found food and add multiple targest to a new bfs?
2011-12-13T04:23:51  <antimatroid1> no, your search queue already has the other searches all in it
2011-12-13T04:25:25  <antimatroid1> the two options i got down to were this simultaneous bfs from food to ants vs. iterative bfs from all food to ants, i decided on the later

2011-12-13T04:26:11  <McLeopold> I'm doing iterative bfs from all food to ants
2011-12-13T04:26:24  <antimatroid1> i don't think you're going to get much better
2011-12-13T04:26:53  <antimatroid1> one thing i do is only collect food if there's a known path to it (which i know from nearest friend hill information i maintain)
2011-12-13T04:27:19  *** jon1 <jon1!~Adium@2001:67c:90:764:fa1e:dfff:fedf:5943> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-12-13T04:27:28  <McLeopold> I go ahead and do it and my ant then naturally explores
2011-12-13T04:27:31  <antimatroid1> and i'm also only going to collect food in this manner if it's not at least contestable with an enemy, otherwise i'll just add it to later searches
2011-12-13T04:27:55  <antimatroid1> i did that but i decided it's taking to long when i'm sending single ants to targets
2011-12-13T04:28:03  <antimatroid1> so i'm letting exploration happen elsewhere
2011-12-13T04:28:20  <antimatroid1> basically i'm trying to collect the food that needs to be collected optimally and just that with the expensive searches
2011-12-13T04:28:25  <McLeopold> well, he'll get distracted with other targets on the way
2011-12-13T04:28:47  <McLeopold> okay, back to code...
2011-12-13T04:28:58  <antimatroid1> yes, but with maze maps you could be ages away from a food item that actually looks close
2011-12-13T04:29:06  <antimatroid1> i don't like it exploring based off that
2011-12-13T04:30:09  <McLeopold> so you like to expand evenly around the hills?
2011-12-13T04:33:18  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-12-13T04:33:43  <antimatroid1> basically i'm just moving ants to their closest unseen border location (amongst other targets)
2011-12-13T04:33:57  <antimatroid1> so new ants will go towards the closest unseen location to the hill for example
2011-12-13T04:34:09  <antimatroid1> what i really like is the potential enemy border
2011-12-13T04:34:15  <antimatroid1> that's my perimeter idea
2011-12-13T04:34:22  <antimatroid1> (and many others i imagine)

2011-12-13T09:50:53  <UncleVasya> why people do bfs from ants?
2011-12-13T09:51:11  <antimatroid1> well say you want to search from not recently seen locations to ants, how are you going to find the set of not recently seen locations?
2011-12-13T09:51:27  <antimatroid1> just bfs from ALL not recently seen locations? or bfs from ants to find the border of not recently seen locations?
2011-12-13T09:51:36  <UncleVasya> why I will want it?
2011-12-13T09:51:50  <antimatroid1> so you can revisit not recently seen squares for food
2011-12-13T09:52:16  <UncleVasya> Are there any cases when search from target (hill, food, etc)  to my ants is not enough?
2011-12-13T09:52:37  <antimatroid1> my problem is when you don't easily already have the set of targets
2011-12-13T09:52:45  <antimatroid1> ie. not recently seen locations
2011-12-13T09:52:54  <UncleVasya> I make search from target and when ant is found he steps on the father node in search
2011-12-13T09:53:01  <antimatroid1> yes i do that too
2011-12-13T09:53:07  <UncleVasya> ah, ok
2011-12-13T09:53:07  <antimatroid1> but i need the set of targets to start the search
2011-12-13T09:53:31  <UncleVasya> I make this set by myself
2011-12-13T09:53:42  <antimatroid1> well obviously, but how
2011-12-13T09:54:19  <rwest> track how many turns since you last saw each square?
2011-12-13T09:54:26  <antimatroid1> i am doing that
2011-12-13T09:54:38  <antimatroid1> but should i search from all not recently seen squares or the border of not recently seen squares?
2011-12-13T09:54:57  <rwest> I don't search so I dunno from there hah
2011-12-13T09:55:03  <UncleVasya> I check every square in map. If this square is visible and one or more of his neighbours is invisible for n turns - this is internal boundary.
2011-12-13T09:56:30  <UncleVasya> I've decided do not try any optimizations here because chck once every square isn't time-consuming if compare to other staff I do in bot.
2011-12-13T09:57:13  <QuirionPT> how fast are the server computers that run our bots? Compared to a regular laptop core 2 duo
2011-12-13T09:57:32  <QuirionPT> should I expect a major slow down?
2011-12-13T09:57:57  <rwest> speed up, but I believe that shouldn't matter much for timeouts since it is wall time
2011-12-13T09:58:17  <QuirionPT> cool, thanks :)
2011-12-13T10:02:06  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: So when I have a list of internal boundary squares I do bfs from them simultaniously.
2011-12-13T10:03:30  <QuirionPT> UncleVasya, I do exactly the same ;P
2011-12-13T10:04:06  <QuirionPT> UncleVasya, except I use a slightly different method for deciding which squares are sources for the bfs
2011-12-13T10:05:22  <QuirionPT> but still depending only on the number of turns each square was last seen

2011-12-13T11:05:41  <Fluxid> so ant could go in there

2011-12-13T12:52:47  <avdg> you just need to create a program that can predict the best combination

2011-12-13T12:53:25  <pairofdice> Looks interesting
2011-12-13T12:54:19  <avdg> my current view on it is to determine the probability of each character that comes after a certain character
2011-12-13T12:54:40  <avdg> so you have a grid of 24 cols and 24 rows
2011-12-13T12:55:05  <avdg> than calculate the penalty after processing some sample text, lowest win (depending on model)

2011-12-13T13:21:28  <thestinger> antimatroid1: I have two types of "exploration" (food searching and looking for enemy hills), but yeah - I just do a BFS from all targets
2011-12-13T13:21:52  <thestinger> but I prevent ants from going to the same target, and mark all targets in an area as taken when an ant is going to one
2011-12-13T13:22:53  <thestinger> and there's another trick to get a nice even spread for foraging by preventing them from going to a target behind one that is already taken
2011-12-13T13:23:02  <Antimony> ug, it looks like there's a big tradeoff between speed and code prettyness

2011-12-13T13:24:25  <thestinger> C++ is already ugly as hell, it's hard to make it uglier
2011-12-13T13:24:38  <Antimony> wnna bet?
2011-12-13T13:24:44  <thestinger> use C++11 :P
2011-12-13T13:24:52  <thestinger> lots of stuff to make it faster/prettier
2011-12-13T13:25:00  <Antimony> I do, or at least the parts that my compiler supports
2011-12-13T13:25:06  <thestinger> are you on windows?
2011-12-13T13:25:10  <Antimony> no lambdas  or foreach :(
2011-12-13T13:25:21  <Antimony> I mostly just use auto
2011-12-13T13:25:25  <thestinger> mingw has gcc 4.6 on windows
2011-12-13T13:25:30  <Antimony> oh
2011-12-13T13:25:51  <Antimony> I've thought about trying to upgrade before, but I'm always too lazy or scared
2011-12-13T13:25:57  <thestinger> I just used it when I was messing around with a java zero-day and shellcode crap
2011-12-13T13:27:36  <thestinger> lambdas are really nice :)
2011-12-13T13:27:39  <BenJackson> antimatroid1: I have a "frontier" funtion that takes a predicate and produce the boundary between the yes/no areas of the predicate
2011-12-13T13:27:49  <thestinger> they don't seem to really hurt speed at all either, because you end up making the code a lot smaller
2011-12-13T13:27:56  <BenJackson> initially 'ever seen' and now something like 'seen recently'
2011-12-13T13:28:09  <Antimony> if all goes well, my new version will soon be almost as good as my old one
2011-12-13T13:28:17  <thestinger> xD
2011-12-13T13:28:20  <thestinger> that's how I feel
2011-12-13T13:28:31  <thestinger> my bot _finally_ beats my pre-combat bot
2011-12-13T13:28:32  <BenJackson> so I ran v11 overnight on fluxid
2011-12-13T13:28:42  <BenJackson> I'm not sure it played strong enough competition to really know if it is improved
2011-12-13T13:28:55  <BenJackson> fluxid must be really busy
2011-12-13T13:29:11  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, it has tons on people on it
2011-12-13T13:29:17  <BenJackson> there are 10-20 other games between my games
2011-12-13T13:29:23  <thestinger> proper matchmaking would be really nice but it's a bit too late into the contest for that to happen
2011-12-13T13:30:00  <rwest> My bot circles my pre-combat bot and gives him funny looks
2011-12-13T13:30:12  <rwest> and then lets it live
2011-12-13T13:30:25  <BenJackson> first time my combat bot met my pre combat bot the combat bot just went from 1 wide to 2 wide at the front of the snake
2011-12-13T13:30:28  <BenJackson> ate pre-combat alived
2011-12-13T13:30:30  <BenJackson> -d
2011-12-13T13:30:37  <Antimony> my code would be like half the size if I had foreach
2011-12-13T13:30:56  <rwest> BenJackson: I like your bots snake, it piles into walls
2011-12-13T13:30:58  <rwest> v4 that is
2011-12-13T13:31:11  <Antimony> I should do a regex search for "for (auto x = y.begin()..." and see how many hits I get sometime
2011-12-13T13:31:14  <BenJackson> Antimony: the gcc on the site does not have for(a: b) in c++11
2011-12-13T13:31:21  <Antimony> I know
2011-12-13T13:31:23  <Antimony> neither do I
2011-12-13T13:31:36  <Antimony> If I really cared, I could include boost foreach, but it's annoying
2011-12-13T13:32:00  <BenJackson> I could practically get c++11 behavior with "typedef vector<Location>::iterator auto"
2011-12-13T13:32:01  <Antimony> I probably should do some refactoring with boost when I have time
2011-12-13T13:32:07  <Antimony> lol

2011-12-13T13:45:24  <Antimony> yeah
2011-12-13T13:45:55  <Antimony> I've fallen from 56th to 76th, despite increasing skill slightly
2011-12-13T13:46:48  <BenJackson> I hover just out of the top 10, getting in when people resubmit :)
2011-12-13T13:47:08  <BenJackson> so my plan is to be 0.5 better and solidly inside :)

2011-12-13T13:52:30  <UncleVasya> My bot was uploaded at November 20 and for a long time had skill near 83.5. But from last week it jumped in skill to about 85 and sits there. Have no idea, why. The reason could be the grow of total amount of the bots but it doesn't seem to grow fast in last week.
2011-12-13T13:52:43  <a1k0n> yeah, skill is all relative to everyone else
2011-12-13T13:52:46  <Rinum> new maps! a disruption in the rankings!
2011-12-13T13:53:27  <thestinger> I'm pretty much done at this point, not sure what else to code :P
2011-12-13T13:53:31  <a1k0n> i was about to give up on my bot but if i have a chance at 4th...
2011-12-13T13:53:33  <thestinger> need to merge in 11 branches though...
2011-12-13T13:53:47  <a1k0n> i hvae a bunch of numbers pulled out of my butt i could optimize i guess
2011-12-13T13:54:00  <thestinger> a1k0n: yeah, but that's really hard to measure
2011-12-13T13:54:07  <a1k0n> no kidding
2011-12-13T13:54:11  <thestinger> you really need a significant improve to measure a difference on tcp
2011-12-13T13:54:12  <Rinum> I don't know if I should bother with this competition now x.x ... I'd like to maybe break into the top 100
2011-12-13T13:54:19  <thestinger> which is why I have so much trouble deciding if I should merge stuff
2011-12-13T13:54:29  <thestinger> my bot can go from rank 8 to rank 44 for no reason
2011-12-13T13:54:35  <a1k0n> heh
2011-12-13T13:54:39  <thestinger> and then back up
2011-12-13T13:54:46  <BenJackson> I think my skill *number* jumped up because of better competition in the 20..50 range
2011-12-13T13:54:50  <UncleVasya> So the growth of skiil without resubmitting means that other bots became worst? I understand when bot growth in rankings because top guys resubmit often, but does it affect the skill?
2011-12-13T13:55:09  <BenJackson> which made room in the skill ranks for improving bots and pushed the mid 80s up
2011-12-13T13:55:15  <Antimony> I have now got combat sort of working again in the most horribly unoptimized way possible
2011-12-13T13:55:33  <a1k0n> or because other bots got better but you're still not losing too badly to them
2011-12-13T13:55:41  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, mu is getting higher for the top 50
2011-12-13T13:55:52  <UncleVasya> Another explanation is that current version feels that the next one is ready and tries to do its best to not be replaced :)
2011-12-13T13:56:01  <a1k0n> haha
2011-12-13T13:56:08  <a1k0n> or, the new servers have more CPU power
2011-12-13T13:56:14  <thestinger> I went from around 87 before to a bit over 90, but my bot always end up at rank 15 to 30
2011-12-13T13:56:17  <a1k0n> or, the new maps changed dynamics slightly

2011-12-13T13:56:43  <thestinger> _flag
2011-12-13T13:56:44  <pairofdice> flagcapper
2011-12-13T13:56:45  <Anilm3> flag
2011-12-13T13:56:46  <a1k0n> thought so
2011-12-13T13:56:59  <Anilm3> would you guys be interested in continuing the contest after the contest?
2011-12-13T13:57:09  <a1k0n> it looks like xathis might get back into 1st then
2011-12-13T13:57:16  <a1k0n> his sigma is still >2
2011-12-13T13:57:21  <thestinger> Anilm3: meh, I've wasted too much time on this already :P
2011-12-13T13:57:31  <thestinger> anyway, the top bots will release their code and it won't really be fun anymore
2011-12-13T13:57:32  <pairofdice> 99.9 mu
2011-12-13T13:57:33  <pairofdice> heh
2011-12-13T13:58:21  <UncleVasya> Anilm3: such a question was asked during previous one too. People said 'sure' and one guy created a TCP. But no one did really use it :)
2011-12-13T13:58:30  <a1k0n> i hope xathis, pguillory, and flag are good blog writers
2011-12-13T13:58:34  <Anilm3> thestinger: that's true
2011-12-13T13:58:41  <Antimony> do they have existing blogs?
2011-12-13T13:58:42  <Anilm3> haha
2011-12-13T13:58:48  <a1k0n> flag does: flagcapper.com
2011-12-13T13:58:57  <pairofdice> And greentea
2011-12-13T13:58:57  <thestinger> xathis has a flickr xD
2011-12-13T13:59:11  <thestinger> oh, he has twitter
2011-12-13T13:59:15  <xathis> i don't have a blog but i'll write about the bot
2011-12-13T13:59:23  <thestinger> he can make 200 tweets explaining his bot
2011-12-13T13:59:26  <a1k0n> cool.

2011-12-13T14:00:39  <BenJackson> when I look at that game I mostly like what I did there
2011-12-13T14:00:43  <BenJackson> but M24 did it better
2011-12-13T14:01:03  <bqf> xathis: if this is really your flickr, then you sir, are beyond awesome! http://www.flickr.com/photos/xathis/5066027237/in/photostream
2011-12-13T14:01:17  <Fluxid> yaaaay, i'm 20th!
2011-12-13T14:01:40  <Antimony> I'm tempted to submit my current bot with no optimization or island decomposition and see how well it does
2011-12-13T14:01:52  <xathis> bqf: hahaha i took the photo but i'm not one of those guys
2011-12-13T14:02:33  <bqf> xathis: aw, too bad. that lowers you down to "awesome" for knowing those people.
2011-12-13T14:02:48  <thestinger> silly tcp rankings
2011-12-13T14:02:57  <iglo> haha der hammer
2011-12-13T14:03:04  <thestinger> my branches other than _stupid all dropped down a bunch
2011-12-13T14:03:29  <Anilm3> you should reconsider your naming conventions then
2011-12-13T14:03:48  <Anilm3> now all your bots are worst than stupid
2011-12-13T14:03:51  <thestinger> for _stupid I intentionally broke several things to see what would happen...
2011-12-13T14:04:18  <a1k0n> didn't your organization say darmstadt before?  am i crazy?
2011-12-13T14:04:57  <pguillory> BenJackson: know what really impresses me about M24 in that game? the way at turn 295 he has an enemy near his hill but he sends ants past it toward the frontier.  really good judgement
2011-12-13T14:05:03  <a1k0n> oh that's olex.s
2011-12-13T14:05:11  <Antimony> aww man, I get a compile error on the server even though it compiles on my own computer
2011-12-13T14:05:36  <thestinger> are you using gcc 4.6 now?
2011-12-13T14:05:42  <Anilm3> xathis: when's your next game?
2011-12-13T14:05:42  <a1k0n> pguillory: or just lucky?
2011-12-13T14:06:15  <xathis> Anilm3: "Next game should be within 67 minutes"
2011-12-13T14:06:40  <Anilm3> that's too long..
2011-12-13T14:06:59  <a1k0n> he had enough ants around the hill, shrug
2011-12-13T14:07:06  <Antimony> I'm using GCC 4.4.1
2011-12-13T14:07:15  <BenJackson> pguillory: believe it or not this is the first version where I've assigned individual goals to ants other than for food
2011-12-13T14:07:45  <BenJackson> I've known I wanted to do it
2011-12-13T14:07:51  <BenJackson> but got hung up on fancy ways
2011-12-13T14:07:56  <BenJackson> and finally just did something more brute force
2011-12-13T14:08:51  <thestinger> Fluxid: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.30803 your ants are still too scared :P
2011-12-13T14:08:53  <pguillory> a1k0n: i don't think so.  he has about 7 ants nearby to deal with it, and he keeps 2 around and sends 5 away.  very smooth
2011-12-13T14:09:13  <a1k0n> oh, true.  i'd probably end up swarming the one ant
2011-12-13T14:09:40  <Fluxid> thestinger: yeah, "newcombat" sucks cock a bit more than "oldcombat"
2011-12-13T14:10:30  <thestinger> my defense fully kicks in at 15 distance from my hills, so only one ant was actually trying to defend against you
2011-12-13T14:11:14  <BenJackson> I finally graduated my defense

2011-12-13T14:12:02  <pguillory> BenJackson: how's your performance?  i tried doing that but couldn't get consistent performance.  i relied on a lot of shortcuts like grouping clusters of enemy ants together and treating them as one goal, but if they just decided to all spread out one turn... timeout :)
2011-12-13T14:12:59  <Anilm3> pguillory: couldn't that be just go? :P

2011-12-13T14:13:46  <thestinger> Anilm3: Go is fine, the 6g/6l compilers are just meant to compile fast and not make fast code though
2011-12-13T14:13:47  <pguillory> nice
2011-12-13T14:14:00  <BenJackson> I actually know how to better assign goals to ants... but an obvious heuristic is distance from goals to ants
2011-12-13T14:14:13  <BenJackson> if there was more time I'd play with those things
2011-12-13T14:14:16  <BenJackson> but I waffle too much

2011-12-13T14:17:45  <pguillory> i gave up on tweaking a couple of weeks ago, recognizing that my core approach wasn't going to get me to where flag and xathis (and probably others) are now.  since then i've been going for one hail mary after another, total rewrite after total rewrite, looking for a big fundamental leap
2011-12-13T14:17:48  <pguillory> and failing to find it
2011-12-13T14:18:18  <pguillory> i just can't figure out how to do much better than what i've already got out there, and it's really frustrating

2011-12-13T14:19:02  <BenJackson> pguillory: just scheduling "defender" ants individually instead of as a mass movement is what made a bot that could consistently beat my previous version
2011-12-13T14:19:25  <BenJackson> I did it in a stupidish brute-force kind of way but it works
2011-12-13T14:19:43  <BenJackson> I was inspired by watching xathis's great economy with ants
2011-12-13T14:19:46  <thestinger> that's the difference between my old version and _newdefend
2011-12-13T14:19:58  <BenJackson> like I said here last night, now my bot looks like a drunk version of his bot :)
2011-12-13T14:20:00  <thestinger> I used to just make them all move on a gradient to enemies (weighted by distance to my hill)
2011-12-13T14:20:38  <BenJackson> huh I got the "info:" line from fluxid but now it's sitting there
2011-12-13T14:21:58  <thestinger> stupid kernel upgrades... now I can't load modules until I reboot
2011-12-13T14:22:58  <a1k0n> pguillory: is your combat method similar to what memetix posted?
2011-12-13T14:25:42  <pguillory> a1k0n: similar
2011-12-13T14:26:05  <BenJackson> if that combat works then I could cut a ton of time out of my bot
2011-12-13T14:26:12  <BenJackson> and spend all my time "strategizing"
2011-12-13T14:26:20  <UncleVasya> Are there another bots that use minimax and happy wth it?
2011-12-13T14:26:49  <a1k0n> it needs careful consideration, but it's probably the best meta-approach.  i don't even compute influence but i prolly should.

2011-12-13T14:28:29  <pguillory> for each potential move, i check the worst case scenario if all nearby enemies converged toward it
2011-12-13T14:28:34  <a1k0n> if my bot stopped randomly suiciding ants who knows how good it would be
2011-12-13T14:28:40  <pguillory> and i do this for enemies as well
2011-12-13T14:29:06  <a1k0n> yeah.  minimax from both sides
2011-12-13T14:29:33  <BenJackson> my combat problems are more meta now.  during non-critical parts of combt my ants don't do things that would improve their chances in n moves
2011-12-13T14:29:53  <pguillory> then i can exclude any friendly moves that *might* be outnumbered
2011-12-13T14:30:12  <a1k0n> how do you ever attack, then?

2011-12-13T14:31:22  <UncleVasya> I guess he sets up score for killing enemy higher then penalty for losing his own
2011-12-13T14:31:40  <pguillory> and i repeat that process until no more moves are excluded.  the repetition is necessary because if one friendly ant decides not to attack, it reduces the potential focus of nearby enemies, which can cause other friendly ants to decide not to attack.  chain reaction
2011-12-13T14:31:51  <a1k0n> oh, brilliant
2011-12-13T14:31:58  <a1k0n> eliminating dominated moves from both sides
2011-12-13T14:32:48  <a1k0n> well, thanks!  i wonder if i have time to implement that now, haha
2011-12-13T14:33:54  <pguillory> any move that is not excluded above but which may attack another ant is guaranteed to win, and so i give it a strong preference
2011-12-13T14:34:49  <BenJackson> oops I'm probably going to time otu my fluxid bot running a 10p game locally
2011-12-13T14:35:11  <a1k0n> god damn it.  i wish i had thought of that weeks ago.  i was contemplating the whole eliminating dominated moves thing but didn't work it out
2011-12-13T14:35:56  <pguillory> and like memetix, in certain situations i accept an even trade or worse.  as my ants get backed up in a choke point, i start accepting different kinds of even trades, then eventually when they get really backed up i just charge, damn the torpedoes
2011-12-13T14:36:29  <a1k0n> heh.  you're good at building up walls without backing up too much.
2011-12-13T14:36:38  <BenJackson> so I added a --pigpile option to playgame
2011-12-13T14:36:50  <BenJackson> where a specified player is revealed to all bots
2011-12-13T14:37:13  <BenJackson> just did a 10 player game of prev submit vs 1 new guy

2011-12-13T14:38:42  <Fluxid> i refreshed and the ranking was.. different
2011-12-13T14:38:50  <Fluxid> fourmidable was third
2011-12-13T14:39:07  <pguillory> and i also memorize patterns in enemy behavior and use those to make predictions about their moves in the future, but i disabled that on the last upload to keep something up my sleeve :)
2011-12-13T14:39:17  <BenJackson> mu 99.90?  seriously?
2011-12-13T14:39:43  <a1k0n> pguillory: haha.  i saw your comment to that effect in your "about me" section
2011-12-13T14:39:56  <a1k0n> i hope my random behavior defeats that
2011-12-13T14:40:21  <a1k0n> detecting timed out bots tho, that would be useful
2011-12-13T14:41:06  <pguillory> unfortunately it also detects non-deterministic behavior as such and declines to make predictions :/

2011-12-13T15:20:49  <thestinger> I love how quickly the rankings shift now that the game rate is really high
2011-12-13T15:21:41  <BenJackson> I reloaded the page but I don't see that result
2011-12-13T15:21:48  <BenJackson> oh there it goes
2011-12-13T15:21:55  <BenJackson> janzert: caching of rankings page wonky?
2011-12-13T15:21:58  <Anilm3> xathis: you have now another tough rival with flag
2011-12-13T15:22:22  <BenJackson> I think if I resubmit I might get into the 90s skill wise
2011-12-13T15:22:29  <BenJackson> but not mu>100 :)
2011-12-13T15:26:08  *** Rinum <Rinum!62e36dae@gateway/web/freenode/ip.98.227.109.174> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-13T15:26:30  <Rinum> for battles... should we use ceil(attack radius)?
2011-12-13T15:27:05  <_flag> Well, first was fun while it lasted :(
2011-12-13T15:27:37  <a1k0n> :(
2011-12-13T15:27:52  <Rinum> the current attack radius is 5... so we take the sqrt of that... ~2.23 .... so if an ant is 3 squares away it won't be attacked?
2011-12-13T15:28:14  <a1k0n> well, when xathis finally loses a game you might be in 1st again
2011-12-13T15:28:16  <thestinger> it's 2.23 so that an ant can attack light a knight in chess
2011-12-13T15:28:20  <Rinum> or is euclidean distance not used for battles?
2011-12-13T15:28:21  <thestinger> like a knight*
2011-12-13T15:28:22  <BenJackson> _flag: "A" will always be first on fluxid in my heart
2011-12-13T15:28:26  <_flag> a1k0n: if*
2011-12-13T15:28:39  <_flag> BenJackson: Haha, thanks
2011-12-13T15:28:47  <a1k0n> if he manages to be 1st in every game that would be truly astonishing
2011-12-13T15:28:53  <Rinum> thestinger: that's a great analogy! thanks!
2011-12-13T15:28:56  <BenJackson> he's lost games already
2011-12-13T15:29:12  <xathis> a1k0n: i already lost a few games with v2

2011-12-13T15:29:28  <a1k0n> oh yeah
2011-12-13T15:29:39  <a1k0n> a couple stalemates with GreenTea too
2011-12-13T15:30:00  <BenJackson> my rank: 7584!
2011-12-13T15:30:02  <thestinger> wow, memetix has nice movement
2011-12-13T15:30:18  <BenJackson> prev game:  3rd to xathis, resubmit, 1st vs 4 bots in the 5000s :)
2011-12-13T15:30:20  <janzert> BenJackson: beyond the occasional problem it has had?
2011-12-13T15:30:41  <janzert> it seems to be fine for me atm
2011-12-13T15:30:44  <Anilm3> BenJackson: that's a moral boost isn't it?
2011-12-13T15:30:45  <BenJackson> janzert: someone did @rankings here and I hit reload and saw very stale data
2011-12-13T15:31:01  <Rinum> @rankings
2011-12-13T15:31:02  <contestbot> Rinum: Top 10 players: xathis(93.2), FlagCapper(93.1), pguillory(92.7), a1k0n(90.5), fourmidable(90.1), ThisIsNotABug(89.2), delineate(88.7), Hammerok(88.0), jacob_strauss(87.7), JG.WAS(87.6)
2011-12-13T15:31:19  <BenJackson> Anilm3: well not so much when it turns out the setup was one of those starter-kit-killer things
2011-12-13T15:31:30  <Anilm3> haha
2011-12-13T15:31:35  <BenJackson> I had 11 ants and 8 in the hive, all my opponents suicided on move 27
2011-12-13T15:31:37  <janzert> sometimes it seems to show completely incorrect data, e.g. from a specific organization or language
2011-12-13T15:31:54  <BenJackson> but hey, the game happened so fast I hadn't even checked to see if my submit built
2011-12-13T15:31:58  <BenJackson> so yay more servers
2011-12-13T15:32:10  <BenJackson> janzert: earlier someone didn't see xathis on top at all
2011-12-13T15:32:36  <janzert> pguillory had a rough morning
2011-12-13T15:32:44  <Anilm3> yeah
2011-12-13T15:33:05  <janzert> BenJackson: right, it'll sometimes not show a whole bunch of the players
2011-12-13T15:33:11  <pguillory> yup
2011-12-13T15:33:30  <janzert> pretty sure it's probably something with the memcache code but I've never looked into it
2011-12-13T15:33:39  <a1k0n> i've frequently seen just the players with 'Other' as their organization
2011-12-13T15:34:07  <a1k0n> maybe the memcache key is funky
2011-12-13T15:36:35  <avdg> just owned by a bot who sends all his ants on 1 hill :p

2011-12-13T15:42:29  <BenJackson> I think my bot would have snuck out of that corner and fed
2011-12-13T15:42:31  <avdg> :p I'm already laughing without seeing the game
2011-12-13T15:42:40  <pairofdice> It's a shame that the last DARPA  challenge was in 2007

2011-12-13T15:45:11  <Fluxid> Anilm3: autonymous cars driven by ai in the streets
2011-12-13T15:45:27  <BenJackson> avdg: the one live ant wins
2011-12-13T15:45:38  <avdg> BenJackson: the starter bot :p
2011-12-13T15:45:46  <BenJackson> but I think he also could have suck out, gotten that food, suicided with the attacker near his base, then gotten more food and broken out
2011-12-13T15:45:52  <BenJackson> oh, it was a starter?  haha
2011-12-13T15:45:55  <pairofdice> Google's driverless car has driven public streets for hundreds of thousands of kms
2011-12-13T15:46:05  <Anilm3> Fluxid: that's cool
2011-12-13T15:46:18  <avdg> Fluxid: I wonder if the main sponser would be an insurance company by then ;-)
2011-12-13T15:46:21  <pairofdice> Pretty impressive
2011-12-13T15:47:07  <Antimony> I think I figured out why my bot doesn't compile on the server
2011-12-13T15:47:09  <Fluxid> pairofdice: what?
2011-12-13T15:47:17  <Antimony> it assumes unsigned int and size_t are convertable

2011-12-13T16:57:38  <Anilm3> I have powers

2011-12-13T16:57:51  <jstrong> xathis: once this comp is over
2011-12-13T16:57:54  <jstrong> you better release the source

2011-12-13T16:58:50  <Fluxid> i think xathis skill slowly hits a limit when he can't go any hi... oh, hey, he did
2011-12-13T16:59:05  <jstrong> you can get to 100!
2011-12-13T16:59:07  <jstrong> i just know it!
2011-12-13T16:59:28  <avdg> I think xathis bot could be a little bit better and not put 10 ants on 1 enemy ;-)
2011-12-13T16:59:29  <amstan> oh man.. look at that top 4
2011-12-13T16:59:35  <avdg> so there is some room for improvements
2011-12-13T16:59:38  <xathis> in the beta i had a skill higher than 100, it's possible
2011-12-13T16:59:56  <Anilm3> amstan: the next beta don't forget to call me
2011-12-13T17:00:08  <amstan> Anilm3: that's not how it works
2011-12-13T17:00:49  <xathis> avdg: i was thinking about setting a limit on how many ants should follow a single enemy, never did it though
2011-12-13T17:01:03  <jstrong> xathis: just curious .. is your bot an "emergent" solution
2011-12-13T17:01:06  <ikaros> btw amstan, how are the topics for the aichallenges chosen?
2011-12-13T17:01:08  <jstrong> or is it very very finetuned
2011-12-13T17:01:09  <Anilm3> amstan: anyone can enter the beta or is it restricted?
2011-12-13T17:01:18  <jstrong> in other words did you just implement XYZ principles and let them work
2011-12-13T17:01:23  <ikaros> i hope it will be open :)
2011-12-13T17:01:26  <amstan> Anilm3: anyone can, but don't expect us to advertise it
2011-12-13T17:01:27  <jstrong> or were you sticking your hand in there coding in special cases and that type of thing
2011-12-13T17:01:30  <xathis> oh and jstrong of course i will release the source, but as i've said a few times it's a mess i'm not really proud of :D
2011-12-13T17:01:34  <amstan> Anilm3: if you want to help, then stick around and help
2011-12-13T17:01:43  <Anilm3> I will :)
2011-12-13T17:01:45  <amstan> ikaros: what topics?

2011-12-13T17:02:39  <amstan> there's no such things as devs, unless you mean comitters
2011-12-13T17:02:48  <ikaros> well ok
2011-12-13T17:02:50  <xathis> jstrong: something in between... most of the intelligent behaviour is not hardcoded but i've implemented some special cases
2011-12-13T17:02:53  <ikaros> perfect :)
2011-12-13T17:02:54  <avdg> xathis: I actually hoped that the best bots actually calculate the possible moves of the locked enemies and the required numbers of ants to kill it (in case its not in the edge of the fog of war)
2011-12-13T17:03:09  <jstrong> xathis: okay :), just curious

2011-12-13T17:13:24  <BenJackson> the bot I just played who was #2354 was not a starter kit but not far off
2011-12-13T17:13:33  <BenJackson> there is such a huge bot wasteland down there
2011-12-13T17:13:37  <BenJackson> (no offense :)
2011-12-13T17:13:55  <Anilm3> it is BenJackson
2011-12-13T17:14:31  <a1k0n> heh, i know.  my wife chided me for arrogance when i pointed that out
2011-12-13T17:14:55  <BenJackson> I'm kind of surprised that trueskill causes them all to have 30ish skill
2011-12-13T17:15:11  * avdg is happy that his bot is in the top 2k again
2011-12-13T17:15:19  <BenJackson> my skill is now 34.7 and that's 7337 place
2011-12-13T17:15:51  <Anilm3> a1k0n: that's unfair on her part!!
2011-12-13T17:15:55  <Anilm3> haha
2011-12-13T17:16:23  <Anilm3> one thing is being arrogant and another very different is being objective :P
2011-12-13T17:17:14  <BenJackson> I doubt there's much ego invested in the starter kits
2011-12-13T17:17:22  <BenJackson> but the guy in 2354 clearly wrote some code

2011-12-13T17:17:52  <ikaros> probably followed the tutorial a bit

2011-12-13T17:18:10  <jstrong> i still have remnants of tutorial code in my bot

2011-12-13T17:19:21  <BenJackson> I kind of project that across the top 1000
2011-12-13T17:19:30  <BenJackson> but there probably aren't really 1000 active participants
2011-12-13T17:19:41  <ikaros> hmm
2011-12-13T17:19:42  <Garf> you could check what by counting bots with > 1 submission
2011-12-13T17:19:56  <Garf> maybe, >1 submission and >1 day apart
2011-12-13T17:19:57  <BenJackson> whenever I resubmit it becomes momentarily interesting to see what is going on at position 500 or whatever
2011-12-13T17:20:03  <BenJackson> and try to figure out what the heck they did
2011-12-13T17:23:39  <Garf> starter bot + entire-map-routing is about 70, which puts you around 450

2011-12-13T17:24:51  <Garf> looks like there's about 3000 active participants
2011-12-13T17:25:22  <Garf> rank 3000 has mu = 45, and most people there submitted 2-4 times

2011-12-13T17:32:06  <Antimony> after tearing out my old island code, now I have to redo island spliiting
2011-12-13T17:32:10  <thestinger> lol, I submitted 30 times in a row when I was trying to fix a C++11 thing
2011-12-13T17:32:34  <thestinger> kept getting weird compiler errors because gcc 4.5 doesn't have some of the stuff 4.6 is letting me use
2011-12-13T17:32:50  <thestinger> finally figured out that std::array.size() doesn't work properly in gcc 4.5
2011-12-13T17:32:52  <Antimony> Use gcc 4.4 like I do!
2011-12-13T17:32:58  <thestinger> lambdas :(
2011-12-13T17:33:10  <Antimony> array size seems to be working for me
2011-12-13T17:33:10  * avdg is stuck with gcc 4.2
2011-12-13T17:33:14  <thestinger> also 4.4 allows stuff that 4.5 doesn't allow
2011-12-13T17:33:18  <Antimony> I haven't submitted yet though
2011-12-13T17:33:19  <thestinger> Antimony: std::array?
2011-12-13T17:33:20  <Antimony> oh
2011-12-13T17:33:25  <thestinger> not C arrays
2011-12-13T17:33:37  <Antimony> it's weird that it works in 4.4 and 4.6 but not 4.5
2011-12-13T17:33:44  <thestinger> like std::array<Direction, 4> directions = {NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST};
2011-12-13T17:33:51  <thestinger> directions.size() is supposed to be a constexpr
2011-12-13T17:33:51  <BenJackson> I'm actually using 4.2.1 at home
2011-12-13T17:34:15  <thestinger> but 4.5 doesn't actually implement constexpr, even though it has the keyword
2011-12-13T17:34:21  <thestinger> it was so confusing
2011-12-13T17:34:33  <thestinger> so yeah, like version 11 to version 41 of my bot was fixing that xD
2011-12-13T17:35:44  <BenJackson> I was avoiding resubmitting until I was sure I was better
2011-12-13T17:35:44  <thestinger> using std::array instead of std::vector really speeds up some stuff where a lot of objects are being used
2011-12-13T17:35:46  <Antimony> it's kind of painful seeing how bad at combt the newest version of my bot is
2011-12-13T17:35:55  <BenJackson> but I wasn't getting that much variety of games on fluxid when I tried yesterday
2011-12-13T17:35:58  <BenJackson> so I figured I'd resub
2011-12-13T17:36:21  <Antimony> currently, it solves every single ant in the map as a single island
2011-12-13T17:36:27  <thestinger> std::array is basically sugar for a C array, but you have .begin(), .end(), .size(), etc. - so it's a drop-in replacement for a vector
2011-12-13T17:36:29  <Antimony> so it always runs out of time before comign up with anthing good
2011-12-13T17:36:32  <Antimony> I know
2011-12-13T17:36:35  <Antimony> I've used boost array before
2011-12-13T17:36:57  <thestinger> C++11 also has std::begin() and std::end() functions
2011-12-13T17:37:05  <thestinger> so you can mostly use C arrays everywhere
2011-12-13T17:37:16  <thestinger> but then I would have to change my code to use those instead of .begin() and .end()
2011-12-13T17:37:44  <Antimony> I always wondered why the new foreach didn't use .begin and .end
2011-12-13T17:37:56  <Antimony> so it's to work with c arrays and strings?
2011-12-13T17:38:05  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-13T17:38:39  <thestinger> for templated functions mostly
2011-12-13T17:39:01  <BenJackson> I think it's funny how c++0x basically does have "auto" as long as you call a function
2011-12-13T17:39:07  <Antimony> I'm tired. I'll try making my bot non braindead later
2011-12-13T17:39:23  <BenJackson> eg template <I> transform (I begin, I end, ...)  { for(; begin != end; ++begin) { ... }}
2011-12-13T17:39:33  <Antimony> I use auto heavily
2011-12-13T17:39:35  <BenJackson> that's all very clean and you never had to write giant_template<with arguments>::iterator anywhere
2011-12-13T17:40:02  <BenJackson> but if you don't indirect through a function where the template argument will be automatically applied you have to write it out
2011-12-13T17:40:17  <Antimony> usually I only write the type if it is 3 characters or if I need implici casting

2011-12-13T18:20:41  <McLeopold> I think in c you would need a switch statement and need to save state
2011-12-13T18:21:20  <BenJackson> in C/C++ there's no way to return multiple times.  You could simulate the result but your generating code would be very aware of it
2011-12-13T18:21:33  <BenJackson> go has goroutines which probably give you something quite similar
2011-12-13T18:21:50  <BenJackson> your generator would be a goroutine and would feed your other thread
2011-12-13T18:21:54  <BenJackson> but I'm no Go expert
2011-12-13T18:22:50  <BenJackson> a C++ iterator is a good example of all you can accomplish in C++.
2011-12-13T18:23:27  <BenJackson> eg input_iterator<int>(cin) is similar to while True: yield sys.stdin.read()
2011-12-13T18:23:44  <BenJackson> except I just gave you the complete python implementation and merely the NAME of the c++ :)
2011-12-13T18:26:09  <BenJackson> sorry while True: yield int(sys.stdin.read())

2011-12-13T19:03:32  <BenJackson> is anyone else more nervous about losing the games against 1000 ranked players than the top 20?  each time I'm up for such a game I'm thinking "come on, don't have some stupid bug..."
2011-12-13T19:03:32  <thestinger> I really like generators in Python though
2011-12-13T19:05:05  <Antimony> the only real problem with python generators is that they can't be copied
2011-12-13T19:06:17  <thestinger> mozilla's javascript also has yield for making generators (and it has list comprehensions, so it might have generator expressions too)
2011-12-13T19:06:26  <thestinger> I think that's going to be in ecmascript 6

2011-12-13T19:07:01  <BenJackson> Antimony: there's a thing in itertools to clone them
2011-12-13T19:07:04  <BenJackson> with the obvious storage problems
2011-12-13T19:07:35  <thestinger> everything in haskell can basically be a "generator" due to lazy evaluation
2011-12-13T19:07:38  <thestinger> which is nice :)

2011-12-13T19:08:09  <jstrong> thestinger: coffeescript
2011-12-13T19:08:16  <jstrong> there's your answer
2011-12-13T19:08:20  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-13T19:08:52  <thestinger> list comprehensions and generators are a performance boost when the VM actually supports them though
2011-12-13T19:09:02  <thestinger> with coffeescript it probably becomes slower
2011-12-13T19:09:17  <jstrong> well coffeescript is jsut a compiler
2011-12-13T19:09:19  <jstrong> it compiles to native JS
2011-12-13T19:09:28  <jstrong> it doesn't use a VM

2011-12-13T19:09:42  <thestinger> yeah, but JS is basically the bytecode for coffeescript :P

2011-12-13T19:20:05  <McLeopold> I've got new exploring code, who wants to download a 54mb replay file with visualizations? :D
2011-12-13T19:20:07  <pguillory> McLeopold: there are two ways i know of to do iteration in Go: https://gist.github.com/1474598
2011-12-13T19:21:42  <pguillory> but channels are about 50 times slower than callbacks
2011-12-13T19:23:29  <McLeopold> pguillory: what about coroutines?  same thing?
2011-12-13T19:23:59  <thestinger> McLeopold: goroutines are basically concurrent coroutines
2011-12-13T19:24:11  <thestinger> and they can be multiplexed over real threads
2011-12-13T19:24:39  <McLeopold> so, would you say go could be as fast a c, or as low level?
2011-12-13T19:24:43  <thestinger> by default it's just concurrent (not parallel), but you can change it
2011-12-13T19:24:53  <thestinger> it could be as fast as idiomatic C++, if they had a good compiler
2011-12-13T19:25:19  <thestinger> well
2011-12-13T19:25:21  <McLeopold> can it be functional? or do you have to do oops?
2011-12-13T19:25:25  <thestinger> and they need compile-time generics
2011-12-13T19:25:33  <thestinger> it's not really OOP in the same way as java/C++
2011-12-13T19:25:38  <thestinger> there's no inheritance
2011-12-13T19:25:42  <BenJackson> pguillory: thanks for the example
2011-12-13T19:25:45  <McLeopold> at all?
2011-12-13T19:25:46  <thestinger> but there are first-class functions and closures
2011-12-13T19:25:54  <BenJackson> pguillory: I suspect "callbacks" get inlined
2011-12-13T19:25:57  <thestinger> well, you use interfaces (which is their form of polymorphism)
2011-12-13T19:26:20  <thestinger> BenJackson: I don't think the regular Go compilers do any inlining
2011-12-13T19:26:27  <McLeopold> abstracts?
2011-12-13T19:26:36  <BenJackson> also Scala makes that even prettier
2011-12-13T19:26:38  <McLeopold> can you create a class with some pre existing code?
2011-12-13T19:26:38  <thestinger> well, it's like manual duck typing
2011-12-13T19:26:39  <pguillory> negative on the inlining :(
2011-12-13T19:26:47  <BenJackson> but I shied away from using scala because I saw comments about JVM perf problems on the forum
2011-12-13T19:26:50  <thestinger> gccgo does inlining
2011-12-13T19:27:17  <thestinger> the 6g/6l, 8g/8l, etc. compilers are just supposed to be fast - they're based on the plan9 C compilers
2011-12-13T19:27:23  <thestinger> they don't optimize like gcc/llvm

2011-12-13T19:30:24  <BenJackson> my impression is that it was interesting ideas implemented by grad students
2011-12-13T19:30:34  <BenJackson> but not really polished like version 7 unix and its derivatives
2011-12-13T19:30:40  <thestinger> well, I think Ken Thompson and Rob Pike really aim for the most pragmatic solutions

2011-12-13T19:31:13  <avdg> yeah, but that is the theoretical score
2011-12-13T19:31:18  <avdg> and so far, nobody hit 100
2011-12-13T19:31:18  <BenJackson> the only nice thign about working on a plan 9 kernel was that it was ripe for performance improvements

2011-12-13T19:46:02  <McLeopold> I'm gonna try this technique for keeping area visible now

2011-12-13T19:47:45  <rebelxt> McLeopold: hey, i just added a 2nd worker to my private test server, but all games are still getting assigned to the first worker. any quick hint how to fix?
2011-12-13T19:47:46  <thestinger> a web application or something?
2011-12-13T19:48:35  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I'm now iteratively collectiong the unseen border, removing all targets in vision of a collected target
2011-12-13T19:49:11  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I generate the unseen border when I calculate closest friend hill information
2011-12-13T19:49:13  <McLeopold> rebelxt: make some api calls from the second worker to ensure it is authenticated
2011-12-13T19:49:53  <ikaros> McLeopold, the dont seem to distribute that good in your replay(paste) .. i had that same problem with this method
2011-12-13T19:50:01  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I've beefed up my bfs to be passed in functions that define what is a path and what blocks the search
2011-12-13T19:50:07  <rebelxt> McLeopold: it's authenticated. heartbeats come through, but server is assigning all games to worker 1
2011-12-13T19:50:16  <McLeopold> then I've wrapped 2 of them up in a struture that does the bounce back
2011-12-13T19:50:22  <McLeopold> it's all python generators :)
2011-12-13T19:50:23  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I tried to generalise path finding a while ago and decided it was a terrible mistake :)
2011-12-13T19:50:43  <antimatroid1> but i think that's just cause i do it differently all over the place
2011-12-13T19:50:45  <antimatroid1> and update things etc.
2011-12-13T19:51:01  <McLeopold> ikaros: no, I wasn't trying to distribute yet, just go for the closest unknown to the hill
2011-12-13T19:51:21  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: have you set up potential enemy information?
2011-12-13T19:51:30  <antimatroid1> potential/possible
2011-12-13T19:51:32  <ikaros> ok
2011-12-13T19:52:35  <McLeopold> ikaros: if you look at how I explored to the sw, I used 5 ants and spread out quite well covering the unknown areas
2011-12-13T19:53:32  <ikaros> when i tried this
2011-12-13T19:53:48  <ikaros> it worked well for never seen areas and the "outer ring" of ants
2011-12-13T19:54:39  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: no, I just mark unseen locations where I thought the enemy was
2011-12-13T19:55:01  <McLeopold> if an ant chases me at the edge of vision, I have a trail of locations I think an enemy is at
2011-12-13T19:55:14  <ikaros> but when all tiles are explored? do you just reset them or count the times youve seen them
2011-12-13T19:55:17  <antimatroid1> I track where enemies could possibly be
2011-12-13T19:55:26  <ikaros> tried so many variations and it was all crap :O
2011-12-13T19:55:28  <antimatroid1> starting with all unseen squares as possibly enemies
2011-12-13T19:55:34  <ikaros> so i did it totally different then
2011-12-13T19:55:49  <ikaros> but im still wondering why it didnt work out with simple bfs
2011-12-13T19:55:50  <McLeopold> rebelxt: a game isn't assigned to a worker unless a worker requests one, so the second worker must not be requesting any?
2011-12-13T19:56:48  <McLeopold> ikaros: once all tiles are seen, I'll switch from unseen to visible
2011-12-13T19:56:49  <antimatroid1> ie. at the start of a turn if a hill isn't visible then there's possibly an ant there, then at the end of each turn, each visible ant becomes a possible ant and you propogate(/whatever) the information outwards
2011-12-13T19:57:16  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: so, an enemy influence map?
2011-12-13T19:57:29  <antimatroid1> i don't really understand what people mean by influence map?
2011-12-13T19:57:39  <ikaros> well thats simple :O
2011-12-13T19:57:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: so, an enemy map?
2011-12-13T19:58:04  <antimatroid1> possible enemy map
2011-12-13T19:58:11  <ikaros> just a map where you propagate some kind of influence somehow from specific sources :)
2011-12-13T19:58:15  <McLeopold> do you have probabilities?
2011-12-13T19:58:18  <antimatroid1> no
2011-12-13T19:58:28  <McLeopold> if you did, it might be an influence map
2011-12-13T19:58:29  <antimatroid1> just a yes or no as to whether an enemy ant could possibly reside in that location

2011-12-13T20:02:11  <antimatroid1> if you're backed into a corner
2011-12-13T20:02:11  <thestinger> I guess your ants would just retreat
2011-12-13T20:02:22  <antimatroid1> but yeah otherwise you can just retreat
2011-12-13T20:02:29  <antimatroid1> they can't have 5 ants turning up to every battle like that
2011-12-13T20:02:32  <BenJackson> this guy has mad hax: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=10100
2011-12-13T20:02:48  <BenJackson> check out how many games he played from 12:45 to 12:59
2011-12-13T20:03:03  <a1k0n> haha.  seeding race condition again?
2011-12-13T20:03:17  <antimatroid1> i want to know what username account is using
2011-12-13T20:04:24  <antimatroid1> FlagCapper is awfully close to xathis
2011-12-13T20:05:23  <kevlar_work> is there any way to know the max amount of memory we're allowed to use?
2011-12-13T20:06:04  <BenJackson> it's 1G or 1.5G or something
2011-12-13T20:06:20  <kevlar_work> hmm.
2011-12-13T20:06:27  <antimatroid1> that's heaps!
2011-12-13T20:06:28  <Wraithan> kevlar_work: more likely is that you are running out of time. unless you are using 10MB per ant.
2011-12-13T20:06:44  <Wraithan> antimatroid1: http://instantrimshot.com/
2011-12-13T20:07:20  <kevlar_work> Wraithan, I can go up to ~300 ants in some games and others it "times out" at ~120.  If I get close to the time, my engine punts and says "go" anyway and just doesn't move the rest of the ants
2011-12-13T20:07:57  <Wraithan> sure, supposing everythign is wokring properly and you always catch it when it is about to time out
2011-12-13T20:08:09  <Wraithan> as well as supposing there is no noise on the system you are playing on
2011-12-13T20:08:38  <kevlar_work> Wraithan, it lets you come back even if you time out for one move unless it loses its connection
2011-12-13T20:08:50  <kevlar_work> unless that's different online than in the dev version
2011-12-13T20:08:55  <Wraithan> define it?
2011-12-13T20:09:00  <Wraithan> if you timeout you are gone for the game
2011-12-13T20:09:15  <Wraithan> and that is the same in the dev version
2011-12-13T20:09:30  <kevlar_work> hmm...
2011-12-13T20:09:35  <kevlar_work> I thought I tested that case.
2011-12-13T20:10:01  <kevlar_work> and in any case, I give myself 200ms leeway, which has been more than enough in every load scenario I've tested
2011-12-13T20:10:34  <kevlar_work> (I usually require no more than 7ms)
2011-12-13T20:11:14  <kevlar_work> oh well, I'll see what happens in the upcoming games.  There's no way to save a log that you can retrieve afterward, is there?

2011-12-13T20:20:11  <Antimony> I just made my combat smarter. And now my ants run away, even when it's 3 on 1 and they're supposed to be gaurding the hill
2011-12-13T20:20:22  <bmh> Antimony: "Smarter"
2011-12-13T20:20:44  <bmh> I finally got around the writing the code that determines if my ants might be in combat with other ants next turn. Hooray for a 2d topographic sort.
2011-12-13T20:23:44  <BenJackson> Antimony: that has happened to everyone so far
2011-12-13T20:24:10  <Antimony> but it shouldn't be possible with the wy my scoring is set up
2011-12-13T20:24:15  <bmh> BenJackson: can you tell me if bhickey.net:2080 is alive? I have a really slow internet connectoin at the moment
2011-12-13T20:24:20  <Antimony> at the very least, they have garuteed victory
2011-12-13T20:24:27  <Antimony> so they shouldn't retreat at all
2011-12-13T20:24:44  <BenJackson> bmh: if it is it's slow
2011-12-13T20:25:00  <BenJackson> Antimony: helps to set up scenarios to test those things
2011-12-13T20:25:13  <BenJackson> bmh: I think it replied eventually with a blank page

2011-12-13T20:28:11  <Antimony> ok, it looks like the enemy could have made a 1v1 trade
2011-12-13T20:28:22  <Antimony> I guess my "accept no losses ever" strategy is a bad idea
2011-12-13T20:29:18  <Antimony> what can I do?
2011-12-13T20:30:25  <BenJackson> I have a gradient of enemy value that goes up as you get near my hill
2011-12-13T20:30:43  <McLeopold> Antimony: don't retreat near your hill, so check ant hill distance and exclude moves based on that
2011-12-13T20:30:44  <BenJackson> if it can kill anything it will once they get close enough
2011-12-13T20:30:48  <BenJackson> even if it's futile
2011-12-13T20:30:53  <BenJackson> but if they can't kill anything they'll still run
2011-12-13T20:31:15  <avdg> :p I like the questions on ai-class, I was thinking "no, no, no‚Ä¶no, euuuh‚Ä¶ yes"
2011-12-13T20:31:35  <Antimony> I think I'll add a penalty for unkilled enemies within one step of the hill, so my guards will suicide to stop it
2011-12-13T20:32:16  <Antimony> I'm not sure if there's an easy way to work that into my current system though...

2011-12-13T22:03:12  <BenJackson> I see I'm only giving one ant order
2011-12-13T22:03:19  <BenJackson> I see the only ants I see are enemy ants
2011-12-13T22:03:23  <BenJackson> I'm seeing new (!) water tiles
2011-12-13T22:03:29  <BenJackson> so I surmise I'm down to 1 ant and he's on the run!
2011-12-13T22:04:04  <thestinger> I added some output like % of map visible, # of hills I've killed, etc.
2011-12-13T22:04:09  <thestinger> so it's more interesting to watch :P

2011-12-13T22:14:25  <kevlar> so apparently a cutoff at 90% of the turntime should be more like turntime-100ms for me...

2011-12-13T22:33:48  <jstrong1> yeah
2011-12-13T22:33:49  <jstrong1> what did they do?
2011-12-13T22:34:05  <BenJackson> new sponsor with servers
2011-12-13T22:34:20  <BenJackson> since their previous problem was not being able to use money this solved the problem more directly
2011-12-13T22:34:21  <avdg> oh, that part
2011-12-13T22:35:00  <avdg> hmm, I think my game hits the 15 min mark
2011-12-13T22:35:29  <yoden-cloud> is the server maybe being slow?
2011-12-13T22:35:34  <yoden-cloud> i'm getting weird timeouts...

2011-12-13T22:35:57  <yoden-cloud> on ants.fluxid
2011-12-13T22:36:19  <avdg> low bandwidth shouldn't be a problem, slow or unstable could be an issue
2011-12-13T22:36:44  <BenJackson> 6th game for my previous version my bot played #8 and won and got to a skill of 72.79
2011-12-13T22:36:44  <avdg> meh, now I have to wait for 15 more players
2011-12-13T22:37:14  <avdg> the game went probably on a server that wants to shut itself down
2011-12-13T22:37:30  <avdg> ah
2011-12-13T22:37:32  <BenJackson> this time 6th game was vs ~#1000 (times 5) and got to 60.36
2011-12-13T22:38:02  <avdg> played a game in 16 sec, probably a bug :p

2011-12-13T22:41:48  <BenJackson> fluxid advertises 500ms but actually gives you like 5s
2011-12-13T22:41:51  <BenJackson> you'd have to really work to time out
2011-12-13T22:41:58  <BenJackson> thestinger: .pl is in .de?
2011-12-13T22:42:00  <yoden-cloud> it's packet loss, i think?
2011-12-13T22:42:08  <thestinger> BenJackson: it's hosted in germany
2011-12-13T22:42:13  <yoden-cloud> i'm in ohio, but it usually works OK for me from cleveland...
2011-12-13T22:42:15  <thestinger> Fluxid confirmed it :)
2011-12-13T22:42:19  <thestinger> I guessed with tracepath though
2011-12-13T22:42:23  <thestinger> german web host
2011-12-13T22:43:02  <thestinger> my ping to there is 120ms which is pretty damn good
2011-12-13T22:43:15  <thestinger> since I live in toronto :P

2011-12-13T22:48:44  <yoden-cloud> I can send packets to germany
2011-12-13T22:48:47  <yoden-cloud> however, my wifi
2011-12-13T22:48:50  <yoden-cloud> nopee~~
2011-12-13T22:49:33  <avdg> I'm on wifi as well
2011-12-13T22:50:19  <yoden-cloud> my parents have an impressive ability to pick wireless hardware that is unreliable...
2011-12-13T22:50:27  <yoden-cloud> at least the ethernet part works correctly >.>

2011-12-13T22:56:28  <yoden-cloud> google has servers everywhere
2011-12-13T22:57:02  <BenJackson> this wait to rank up is going to give me more time to play skyrim
2011-12-13T22:57:08  <avdg> yeah, but this ping didn't go to the closest server
2011-12-13T22:57:35  <avdg> it went to california, at least if the ip tables are right
2011-12-13T22:57:51  <thestinger> BenJackson: lol, make an AI that plays skyrim for you :P

2011-12-13T23:26:34  * antimatroid1 wants a game where you're allowed to write your own scripts to run
2011-12-13T23:26:45  <antimatroid1> sort of like this, but you also get to control your bot in real time

2011-12-13T23:42:05  <amstan> oshit, flag's on top
2011-12-13T23:42:23  <_flag> xathis will pass me again soon
2011-12-13T23:42:27  <amstan> _flag: congrats
2011-12-13T23:42:34  <_flag> amstan: thanks :)
2011-12-13T23:42:40  <amstan> apparently you're still going up, and he's going down
2011-12-13T23:42:50  <_flag> If only I could replace the version on the main server with my current version
2011-12-13T23:43:03  <amstan> better version?
2011-12-13T23:43:10  <_flag> amstan: Ignore the arrows, they only give an indication of the most recent game and fluctuate a ton
2011-12-13T23:43:13  <thestinger> _flag: bribe amstan :)
2011-12-13T23:43:16  <_flag> mus are a better indication

2011-12-13T23:43:49  <amstan> i could replace stuff like that actually
2011-12-13T23:44:00  <amstan> just replace it in the submissions folder, then restart the workers
2011-12-13T23:44:06  <amstan> but you'll still have the old games
2011-12-13T23:44:24  <amstan> also.. what's the point
2011-12-13T23:44:28  <amstan> besides time saving?
2011-12-13T23:44:41  <_flag> There's three days left in the contest
2011-12-13T23:44:52  <thestinger> takes like 2-4 days to climb back up
2011-12-13T23:44:57  <amstan> finals will be with reset rankings anyway
2011-12-13T23:45:45  <_flag> This is why I liked how planetwars stats kept your ranking when you resubmitted :P
2011-12-13T23:48:02  <antimatroid1> _flag: but then you never played any of the lower ranked bots :P
2011-12-13T23:48:18  <_flag> antimatroid1: does that matter?
2011-12-13T23:48:42  <antimatroid1> i think a few people had a bit of surprise in the final contest after not playing lower ranked bots in a while
2011-12-13T23:48:54  <antimatroid1> they were a lot less cautious which caused some upsets
2011-12-13T23:49:28  <antimatroid1> i think i'm one of the people you could blame for resetting the ranking every time you submit now :P
2011-12-13T23:49:49  <antimatroid1> a1k0n is up to 4th
2011-12-13T23:49:49  <_flag> Were these people top ~100 players?
2011-12-13T23:51:06  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-12-13T23:51:09  <_flag> What if you were given an option to start from the bottom or not?
2011-12-13T23:51:13  <antimatroid1> asivis or whatever is one example i think
2011-12-13T23:51:20  <_flag> Replace vs. Reset
2011-12-13T23:51:35  <antimatroid1> yeah i think it might be nice if users had a button on their profile to reset their ranking
2011-12-13T23:52:03  <thestinger> if there were more servers I don't think it would be a problem - maybe there will be more sponsors next time
2011-12-13T23:52:08  <antimatroid1> for zeta i suspect tcp servers will be the go but with single user accounts, just let people reset their ranking if they want
2011-12-13T23:53:08  <_flag> thestinger: I think they underestimated how many entries there would be based on the money they asked from Google
2011-12-13T23:53:16  <_flag> They wanted 5-6 servers running at all times
2011-12-13T23:53:39  <_flag> Right now there's 23

2011-12-13T23:58:12  <Antimony> I think my new combat system will actually hurt the bot
2011-12-13T23:58:19  <Antimony> it's too cautious
