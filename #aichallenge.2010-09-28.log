2010-09-28T00:26:12  <Andromeda> anyone on that could answer a TCP server question? I'm new to it and have been "connection refused" error messages.
2010-09-28T00:27:20  <Janzert> what's the command line you are using or at least the ip and port?
2010-09-28T00:27:48  <Janzert> don't post the password if you are using one obviously :)
2010-09-28T00:29:03  <Andromeda> I've copied the posted java client into a TCP.java class, and I've been using this command line call: java TCP "72.44.46.68" "995" "Andromeda" "./runbot.sh" "10000", with runbot.sh containing "java -jar MyBot.jar" as per one of the suggestions on the forums
2010-09-28T00:30:07  <Andromeda> the exact error message: ERROR: error on server connection Connection refused
2010-09-28T00:30:48  <Janzert> hmm, unfortunately (in a sense) that looks correct to me although I don't know much about the java client
2010-09-28T00:31:02  <Janzert> is there a chance a firewall might be blocking your connection?
2010-09-28T00:31:30  <Andromeda> nothing intentional, but I could look into it. It may be worth noting when I used the original IP, I received the message to redirect
2010-09-28T00:32:12  <Janzert> hopefully someone else with more experience will wake up :/

2010-09-28T00:48:48  <Sylph> wonder why people always have to use old C# versions, annoying. :/
2010-09-28T00:48:57  <Janzert> if you're on unix maybe try traceroute -T -p 995 72.44.46.68 and see how far it makes it
2010-09-28T00:49:14  <Sylph> or use tracert for windows
2010-09-28T00:49:33  <Janzert> can tracert do a tcp trace?

2010-09-28T00:52:35  <Janzert> try shift-refreshing the web page and see if it is still really loading? otherwise that's pretty wierd
2010-09-28T00:53:38  <Andromeda> yep, no problems over http, refresh is fine
2010-09-28T00:54:05  <Sylph> are you behind any firewall or router or something that might block it? :/
2010-09-28T00:54:15  <Sylph> i assume you know better than that, but just wondering
2010-09-28T00:54:27  <Andromeda> working on that too, there shouldn't be anything in the way, but im double checking settings
2010-09-28T00:54:44  <Andromeda> we did just upgrade our router so we mayhave overlooked something

2010-09-28T02:03:59  <antimatroid> i think it's mostly irrelevant to know you're ahead?
2010-09-28T02:04:06  <sigh> antimatroid: not at all
2010-09-28T02:04:20  <antimatroid> only thing you might want to do is not claim a planet if the new reward is expected to be negative at turn 200
2010-09-28T02:04:24  <sigh> I think people just have other priorities right now
2010-09-28T02:04:29  <McLeopold> Well, if you bot always wins, there is no point coding for if your behind?
2010-09-28T02:04:42  <antimatroid> exactly, if it's still playing properly given positions
2010-09-28T02:04:47  <antimatroid> then it just means you win faster
2010-09-28T02:04:49  <sigh> and although it's easy to say that you should change your strategy, it's not obvious *how* you should change
2010-09-28T02:05:21  <antimatroid> i try to make my strategy as general as possible, rather than have it try to handle lots of different possible cases
2010-09-28T02:05:22  <sigh> well, if you are behind you should take risks which you would not normally take
2010-09-28T02:05:26  <McLeopold> I've seen my bot stream endlessly into a faster growing enemy.  I think switch strategies at that point would be good.

2010-09-28T02:06:27  <McLeopold> If you make it blink, that's good for you for ship count.

2010-09-28T02:06:38  <antimatroid> it really doesn't make any difference, unless you assume their defence sucks
2010-09-28T02:06:55  <antimatroid> well, maybe owning it for a short period
2010-09-28T02:07:04  <sigh> if you go from 1000-900 => 150-50, it is good
2010-09-28T02:07:05  <antimatroid> but that's dependent on growth size and when they're going to claim it back etc.
2010-09-28T02:07:23  <McLeopold> as long as you own it for a turn, that's a gain in ship count, which is the way to win
2010-09-28T02:07:34  <sigh> even without that extreme, with less ships, they can't control as many planets

2010-09-28T02:08:41  <sigh> antimatroid: I'm not claiming to be right, just providing a counter-point :)
2010-09-28T02:08:51  <McLeopold> antimatroid: what is you bot name?
2010-09-28T02:08:55  <antimatroid> yep
2010-09-28T02:09:11  <antimatroid> youwillfail, but it's a very bad buggy bot on the main server atm
2010-09-28T02:09:34  <antimatroid> we're started work on a much cleaner code base incorporating lots more information at once
2010-09-28T02:09:35  <McLeopold> oh, I'm talking to the aussies now, aren't I?
2010-09-28T02:09:40  <antimatroid> gonna take a while to get it up and running
2010-09-28T02:09:42  <sigh> he was in the top10 for a while
2010-09-28T02:09:44  <antimatroid> yes :)
2010-09-28T02:09:45  <sigh> yup :)
2010-09-28T02:10:17  <antimatroid> are you guys considering future moves yet?
2010-09-28T02:10:31  <antimatroid> i think i worked out how to do that with my program the other night :)
2010-09-28T02:10:55  <McLeopold> I can, but I'm not sure what move to consider.  It feels like it might be too much noise.
2010-09-28T02:11:04  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-09-28T02:11:09  <McLeopold> I get seasick watching kcm1700's games...
2010-09-28T02:11:31  <sigh> I don't consider future moves yet, although I do think about "delayed" moves
2010-09-28T02:11:33  <antimatroid> i'm still having trouble finding a way to pick the optimal combination of moves rather than the most individually optimal moves it can make
2010-09-28T02:11:47  <sigh> antimatroid: I just do greedy search
2010-09-28T02:11:56  <McLeopold> The only idea a had was to assume if someone streams everything from one planet to another, he might continue.
2010-09-28T02:12:06  <McLeopold> I don't know if that's valuable info.
2010-09-28T02:12:19  <sigh> McLeopold: yeah, an "effective growthrate" of sorts

2010-09-28T02:13:12  <antimatroid> i had a cool dp way, but it's way too slow, and any attempts at quickening it sems to reduce back to picking the most individually optimal moves it can find
2010-09-28T02:13:18  <McLeopold> Copybot creeps me out and makes me think reacting is the better way to go.
2010-09-28T02:13:30  <sigh> :)
2010-09-28T02:13:48  <McLeopold> dp?
2010-09-28T02:13:53  <antimatroid> dynamic programming
2010-09-28T02:14:06  <antimatroid> nobody in here has known that, isn't dp popular with cs people? :\

2010-09-28T02:15:05  <McLeopold> that sounds like faster code, but not more accurate code?
2010-09-28T02:15:17  <antimatroid> i have one other (secret)  way to try things, but it's messy so will take a lot of work to build all the heuritstic side stuff in, then hopefully it works
2010-09-28T02:15:27  <McLeopold> I honestly think I could program my bot in excel. :)
2010-09-28T02:15:42  <antimatroid> it's basically breaking a problem up into sub problems such that any future problems can be calculated using hte information you alreday calculated

2010-09-28T02:16:56  <antimatroid> but say you own n planets with ships {s1,..., sn}, then for each planet there's (s1+1)*...*(sn+1) possible strategies you might make to each of the 23 planets
2010-09-28T02:17:07  <antimatroid> once you get more than a couple of planets and ship counts rise, that explodes
2010-09-28T02:17:40  <antimatroid> although, one could try to reduce it by eliminating obviously stupid moves, but that isn't very trivial
2010-09-28T02:17:53  <McLeopold> I don't think you have enough computer for that
2010-09-28T02:17:58  <antimatroid> exactly
2010-09-28T02:18:00  <sigh> antimatroid: yeah, I considered that... but rejected it because of expense
2010-09-28T02:18:41  <McLeopold> You could assume each planet can only have 1 ship.  Maybe that would give you good targets.
2010-09-28T02:18:55  <antimatroid> nah, that wouldn't work very well
2010-09-28T02:19:09  <antimatroid> i've shied away from dp, have a different approach to try once we've set our backend up properly

2010-09-28T02:29:02  <Cyndre_> yea
2010-09-28T02:29:14  <Cyndre_> something someone mentioned reminded me of something to try :)
2010-09-28T02:29:58  <Sylph> it's kinda slow and not convenient :/
2010-09-28T02:30:04  <Sylph> oh you mean the canvas thing
2010-09-28T02:30:05  <Sylph> on the forum
2010-09-28T02:30:08  <Sylph> let me check it out
2010-09-28T02:31:08  <Sylph> unless you mean the showgame/playgame, which  is the one i don't really like

2010-09-28T03:19:47  <antimatroid> anyone speak that language?
2010-09-28T03:20:07  <antimatroid> i assume they're referring to timeout errors on tcp
2010-09-28T03:21:10  <antimatroid> boegel: timeouts are fairly common on the tcp server, due to the server having to communicate with each bot externally, if it's not always happening on there and never anywhere else, i wouldn't be too worried (if you can understand that)
2010-09-28T03:22:34  <boegel> oh, shit, wrong channel, sorry
2010-09-28T03:22:49  <boegel> antimatroid: actually, no, I'm not talking about the time-outs on TCP
2010-09-28T03:23:16  <boegel> antimatroid: I'm talking about the time-outs I'm seeing on the official server, but nowhere else
2010-09-28T03:23:38  <Palmik> Ah, so there is some secret Dutch channel :P
2010-09-28T03:24:16  <boegel> antimatroid: not on the TCP server, even when my bot is running on a slow Pentium 4 system, and not on a cloned server of the dev version of the server
2010-09-28T03:24:21  <boegel> Palmik: not exactly :)
2010-09-28T03:24:43  <boegel> Palmik: I wanted to talk to the people who've set up the cloned server
2010-09-28T03:25:31  <antimatroid> so that's a yes to a secretive dutch channel :P
2010-09-28T03:27:21  <wh1teside> yep, and all the Dutch dudes get on there and trade secret Dutch AI strategies that we don't get to use
2010-09-28T03:27:33  <boegel> Palmik: I'm not sure whether they want it to be mentioned publicly, because that would cause a lot of new users

2010-09-28T08:58:32  <Naktibalda> hmm, out of 10 last games I won 1 game and lost 2 games because of bot issues. (I was going to loose on of them anyway, but it ended few turns too early)
2010-09-28T08:59:09  <Naktibalda> but I can't tell that my bot doesn't issue invalid orders, it's really possible
2010-09-28T09:00:02  <Naktibalda> I just wanted to submit at 3AM

2010-09-28T13:08:50  <BtbN> you beat the first-ranked?
2010-09-28T13:08:59  <bhasker> no suck luck
2010-09-28T13:09:08  <bhasker> still 1 in 11
2010-09-28T13:09:16  <BtbN> had this, too
2010-09-28T13:09:22  <ichti> No, I beat the 65th rank (who have lost 4 matches) apparently
2010-09-28T13:09:26  <BtbN> my random-ai was ranked 73 once
2010-09-28T13:10:34  <krokokrusa> just a moment ago, 3rd place was occupied by a bot who had only one game and the game was a loss to someone from top-10

2010-09-28T14:30:54  <Zannick> the engine doesn't clear stderr, so writing to it can cause timeout because the pipe fills and then you are waiting for it to empty at some point when you try to write to it
2010-09-28T14:31:52  <nullkuhl> once i finish writing my ai bot for galcon, i submit the code then wat happens ? do i start running matches between my bot and other's ? or is there some sorta system bots that i play against ?

2010-09-28T14:58:28  <nullkuhl> okay , so each bot code i submit, it starts to be in about the middle in ranking, then it plays against N random other user's bots, and then it gets a certain ranking,  now if i resubmit a new bot , this starts from scratch ?

2010-09-28T14:59:33  <Zannick> so if you're like me a you submit a very simple bot early then eventually make a good one, all the losses you obtained at first won't matter
2010-09-28T14:59:53  <Zannick> it wouldn't, no, cause it would likely still be defeated by the same opponents

2010-09-28T15:04:37  <nullkuhl> am asking about N
2010-09-28T15:05:57  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=208079 (ignore zero growth planets)
2010-09-28T15:06:17  <Zannick> when your bot is submitted and compiled, it can be played against other bots
2010-09-28T15:06:29  <Zannick> every so often your bot will play another bot
2010-09-28T15:06:36  <Zannick> there is no N
2010-09-28T15:06:50  <Sylph> veillertard, if you're in the chan, your script crashed
2010-09-28T15:07:11  <nullkuhl> Zannick: oh you mean that i pick the bots to play against manually ?
2010-09-28T15:07:17  <Zannick> no, they are picked
2010-09-28T15:07:26  <Zannick> you need do nothing once you submit
2010-09-28T15:07:48  <Zannick> there actually isn't anything you can do, except submit again
2010-09-28T15:07:56  <Sylph> is there ever zero growth planet?
2010-09-28T15:08:16  <Sylph> my script consider them crappy anyway, granted
2010-09-28T15:08:29  <Zannick> Sylph: yes, some maps have 0-growth center planet
2010-09-28T15:08:30  <Sylph> and won't target them til the very end.
2010-09-28T15:08:40  <Sylph> ah yeah
2010-09-28T15:08:42  <nullkuhl> Zannick: okay, my question is, how many games does my submitted bot play ?
2010-09-28T15:08:49  <Sylph> so that's what the -x growth means on the visualizer i use
2010-09-28T15:08:52  <Sylph> i wasn't sure
2010-09-28T15:08:59  <Sylph> was thinking it means 0 growth, but mm
2010-09-28T15:09:20  <Zannick> nullkuhl: the longer you go before resubmitting, the more games your bot will play
2010-09-28T15:09:45  <Sylph> It's not a set number, nullkuhl
2010-09-28T15:09:58  <nullkuhl> aha, so my bot keeps playing random games, till i resubmit
2010-09-28T15:10:01  <Sylph> yes
2010-09-28T15:10:08  <nullkuhl> can it meet the same player twice ?
2010-09-28T15:10:25  <nullkuhl> like can it play against the same bot more than 1 time ?
2010-09-28T15:10:30  <Naktibalda> yes
2010-09-28T15:11:18  <Sylph> i've fought the same bot twice in a row

2010-09-28T15:11:46  <Sylph> in a row
2010-09-28T15:12:12  <nullkuhl> okay , does these games affect my final competition ranking?  or for the final ranking there is a special round that is made to deduce the rankings
2010-09-28T15:12:27  <Sylph> no special round afaik, just keep winning against higher ranked
2010-09-28T15:12:41  <Sylph> winning against lower ranked don't increase your rank much afaik
2010-09-28T15:12:47  <Sylph> from what i notice
2010-09-28T15:13:21  <Sylph> someone who have checked the site script might have more idea though
2010-09-28T15:13:22  <nullkuhl> Sylph: yes but this means if i am ranked the 10th, and i resubmit a smarter bot, it will take it some time to reach the 10th place again
2010-09-28T15:13:26  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-28T15:13:30  <Sylph> well, not really
2010-09-28T15:13:39  <Sylph> the better bot you got the faster it'll be anyway
2010-09-28T15:14:00  <Sylph> if you win 5-7 times in a row, you'll probably be at rank 250-300
2010-09-28T15:14:04  <Sylph> but yea it take time
2010-09-28T15:14:12  <Sylph> that's why people go to the tcp server to test things out, and stuff
2010-09-28T15:14:26  <nullkuhl> i mean lets assume that i wrote the magic code that wins all other bots, if i submit it at the deadline day, i wont win the contest because it wouldnt have played against enough players to gain the 1st rank
2010-09-28T15:14:32  <Sylph> oh yeah
2010-09-28T15:14:43  <Sylph> that'll probably get you at rank 50 if you're lucky
2010-09-28T15:14:47  <Sylph> and you get enough fights
2010-09-28T15:15:15  <Sylph> may want to submit at least 2 weeks in advance, maybe
2010-09-28T15:15:17  <Sylph> allowing some defeats
2010-09-28T15:15:21  <Zannick> the deadline isn't the last day for games
2010-09-28T15:15:26  <Sylph> ah ok
2010-09-28T15:15:29  <Sylph> just submission time
2010-09-28T15:15:30  <Sylph> ?
2010-09-28T15:15:34  <Zannick> yes
2010-09-28T15:15:35  <nullkuhl> aha
2010-09-28T15:15:40  <Sylph> good

2010-09-28T15:15:48  <Zannick> and there's talk of a final tournament similar to previous contests
2010-09-28T15:15:59  <nullkuhl> so for how long will the bot continue playing games ? till the ranking doesnt change anymore ?
2010-09-28T15:16:15  <nullkuhl> after the deadline i mean
2010-09-28T15:16:17  <Sylph> wherearemylegs, your game  crashed :/

2010-09-28T15:16:42  <Zannick> until someone turns off the server or the final tournament starts and your bot didn't make it
2010-09-28T15:18:15  <nullkuhl> final tournament starts for the only top X bots ?
2010-09-28T15:18:53  <Zannick> the details aren't set, but that might be the case

2010-09-28T16:52:00  <bhasker> i hate it when my old bot beats my new bot!
2010-09-28T16:52:31  <Itkovian> hehe
2010-09-28T16:52:45  <Itkovian> you should play mu;ltiple matches though
2010-09-28T16:52:53  <Itkovian> if it's just a lucky shot
2010-09-28T16:53:32  <rabidus> wow
2010-09-28T16:53:42  <bhasker> yea i did that my new bot usually beats my old  bot 60/100 on the sample maps
2010-09-28T16:54:12  <bhasker> i am planning to rewrite the way i do stuff since my current bot seems to be at a dead end in terms of things i can tweak
2010-09-28T16:54:25  <rabidus> it feels kinda good, when you upload your first bot and you are not last at your country leaderboard
2010-09-28T16:54:40  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-28T16:54:51  <rabidus> and you don't feel yourself a coder

2010-09-28T19:56:43  <contestbot> jmcarthur: Ready to serve, my lord.
2010-09-28T19:57:31  <sigh> @later tell sigh I wonder what happens if I try to tell myself something
2010-09-28T19:57:31  <contestbot> sigh: Job's done.
2010-09-28T19:57:47  <sigh> I got a message!
2010-09-28T19:58:00  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3766), sequoh(3641), felixcoto(3624), sighbot(3594), davidjliu(3567), adumlah(3540), Rexxar(3473), McLeopold(3464), bix0r4ever(3453), Longing(3452)
2010-09-28T19:59:10  <davidjliu> heh
2010-09-28T20:01:26  <sigh> dmj is always on top, but the rest of the places are changing all the time
2010-09-28T20:02:49  <bhasker> my bot is slowly making it way to the top 200 at least now
2010-09-28T20:03:04  <bhasker> it gets like 2 games an hour:-\
2010-09-28T20:03:12  <bhasker> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=5822
2010-09-28T20:03:15  <sigh> bhasker: and you got some wins off me on tcp :)
2010-09-28T20:03:22  <bhasker> very few
2010-09-28T20:03:25  <bhasker> mostly i got stomped
2010-09-28T20:03:36  <Zannick> bhasker: i think that's true of most bots
2010-09-28T20:03:37  <bhasker> i won like maybe 1-2 matches against your bot
2010-09-28T20:04:24  *** Cyndre_ is now known as Cyndre
2010-09-28T20:04:49  <bhasker> my bot seems to win/lose in streaks at ties
2010-09-28T20:04:54  <bhasker> it will go like 10 games in a row winning
2010-09-28T20:04:57  <bhasker> then lose 10 in a row
2010-09-28T20:04:58  <bhasker> sometimes
2010-09-28T20:05:22  <sigh> yeah, that happens to everyone
2010-09-28T20:05:23  <bhasker> so it keeps oscillating between 240 eLO to 300 elo
2010-09-28T20:06:23  <sigh> sometimes you win a lot => go up in rank => play stronger people => lose a lot => etc
2010-09-28T20:06:36  <sigh> sometimes it's just randomness
2010-09-28T20:06:55  <sigh> and sometimes it's because you keep getting matched against the same person :P
2010-09-28T20:08:44  <bhasker> yea that happens
2010-09-28T20:08:56  <bhasker> like http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=bhaskerv20.5
2010-09-28T20:09:09  <bhasker> right now i seem to be duking it out with 9-51Bot-test1
2010-09-28T20:09:48  <sigh> I got a slightly shorter streak with of sigh-3 vs sigh-4: http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=sigh-4
2010-09-28T20:10:03  <sigh> kind of useless, since I've already run lots of matches locally :P
2010-09-28T20:10:17  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-28T20:11:04  <bhasker> i need to think of something very different now, my current bot's life is limited now
2010-09-28T20:11:12  <sigh> life?
2010-09-28T20:11:47  <bhasker> ah well let me rephrase that, my current bot's chances of going higher are limited now
2010-09-28T20:11:57  <sigh> ah
2010-09-28T20:12:02  <sigh> mine too
2010-09-28T20:12:02  <bhasker> it has pretty much reached the highest ELO rating it can
2010-09-28T20:12:20  <bhasker> tweaking heuristics can only go so far
2010-09-28T20:13:10  <sigh> yeah, same... I'm having trouble making significant changes... but not sure how to go about making drastic changes
2010-09-28T20:13:32  <sigh> although, I think I'm getting a feel for how some others are implementing their bots
2010-09-28T20:20:30  <bhasker> yea i have been watching other bots too to get an idea of what i could improve
2010-09-28T20:20:39  <bhasker> i still don't have a good heuristic for going after new neutrals
2010-09-28T20:21:12  <sigh> bhasker: sigh-4 fails for exactly that reason :D
2010-09-28T20:21:51  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-28T20:22:50  <sigh> sigh-4 is designed to be more aggressive, but it exposes that exact weakness... it's still there in my other bots, but not as obviously
2010-09-28T20:23:22  <sigh> hopefully, if I figure out how to fix it the aggressive strategy is better overall
2010-09-28T20:23:40  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-28T20:25:17  <sigh> the more I talk in here, the more I realise that everyone has the same problems :)
2010-09-28T20:25:31  <Zannick> almost everyone :/
2010-09-28T20:25:44  <sigh> Zannick: you've got things figured out?
2010-09-28T20:25:45  <sigh> :P
2010-09-28T20:25:54  <Zannick> no, i'm still on the "write a bot" phase
2010-09-28T20:26:07  <jmcarthur> i still can't even test my bot. my progress has been too slow, and my work on my bot too infrequent
2010-09-28T20:26:19  <sigh> that's too bad :(
2010-09-28T20:26:28  <Zannick> yeah, progress is slow
2010-09-28T20:26:46  <jmcarthur> Zannick: you must be working on a "big idea" like i am
2010-09-28T20:27:11  <Zannick> no, i have most of my ideas
2010-09-28T20:27:16  <Zannick> i just work on the bot very infrequently
2010-09-28T20:27:20  <jmcarthur> ah

2010-09-28T20:27:52  <sigh> just a warning that ideas don't always pan out the way you expected
2010-09-28T20:28:13  <Zannick> my bot can: read and store the turn state
2010-09-28T20:28:20  <jmcarthur> sigh: i am well aware of that
2010-09-28T20:28:28  <Zannick> does some internal things
2010-09-28T20:28:44  <jmcarthur> sigh: i don't want to spend hours upon hours tweaking heuristics, so my only alternative is to do something that nobody else is doing
2010-09-28T20:28:55  *** jfrank <jfrank!c05e2622@gateway/web/freenode/ip.192.94.38.34> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-28T20:28:58  <Zannick> and does some calculations to determine what to do for turn one
2010-09-28T20:29:03  <sigh> jmcarthur: I was aware of that from the start too, but I keep learning it the hard way :D
2010-09-28T20:29:23  <jmcarthur> sigh: my idea may very well fail, but i don't care. i'm still learning a lot, and i will learn the most if i do horribly
2010-09-28T20:29:46  <jmcarthur> i think this idea stands a good chance though
2010-09-28T20:29:50  <sigh> jmcarthur: yup, that's a very good attitude :)
2010-09-28T20:29:53  <jmcarthur> but we'll see
2010-09-28T20:29:55  <Zannick> a few of the ideas i had were independently picked up by some people towards the top
2010-09-28T20:30:13  <jmcarthur> i don't think anybody's doing what i'm planning

2010-09-28T20:30:33  <Zannick> that's always good, if it works well :)
2010-09-28T20:30:40  <sigh> :)
2010-09-28T20:31:08  <jmcarthur> yeah, if my idea turns out to work better than all others so far then that means nobody will be able to stand in my way unless they figure it out or top it independently :)
2010-09-28T20:31:30  <jmcarthur> so, high risk, high reward
2010-09-28T20:31:46  <jfrank> i'd like to help process the queue of organization changes from the forum, is there anyone here from the admin team that would be interested in help?
2010-09-28T20:32:41  <jmcarthur> jfrank: speaking on their behalf (as i am not an admin), i'd say the answer is probably going to be yes
2010-09-28T20:33:45  <jmcarthur> but it may depend on in what way you intend to offer help
2010-09-28T20:36:24  <jfrank> it could be as simple as transforming the unprocessed changes into generic update statements, then they could string replace table and column and exec it
2010-09-28T20:37:13  <jfrank> also emptying out the current thread and having people post in a more structured way, such as my org name|id,id,id (where ids are the ids of those who should be moved to said org)
2010-09-28T20:37:58  <jfrank> or if they could be convinced of my trust, i could do it, or add a simple one step profile form. php -> mysql no doubt?

2010-09-28T20:39:00  <jmcarthur> the other ideas could possibly work
2010-09-28T20:39:13  <jfrank> ah yes. the first couple options then. let me know
2010-09-28T20:39:13  <jfrank> bye
2010-09-28T20:39:32  <jmcarthur> amstan: you get that? ^^
2010-09-28T20:40:58  <amstan> jfrank: yeah.. that would be nice
2010-09-28T20:41:39  <jfrank> well if i put one together where can i leave it that you'll see it? at the end of that forum?
2010-09-28T20:42:07  <amstan> jfrank: put what together?
2010-09-28T20:42:59  <jfrank> the transformation of the unprocessed org changes into generic sql statements, which would make your life much easier. then its up to you to vet them, change the tables and columns and so forth
2010-09-28T20:43:44  <Janzert> jfrank: you should be able to look at the schema in the source repository for table names and such

2010-09-28T20:46:30  <troutwine> I took out an issue (180, for reference) requesting that --std=gnu99 get flipped on for gcc. Does anyone know the admins well enough to comment on the possibility of that happening?
2010-09-28T20:48:26  <Janzert> danielvf is likely the one that can do it for you. but I think he is waiting for about a week before doing more language additions/changes

2010-09-28T20:53:14  <DanielVF> I am so behind.
2010-09-28T20:53:26  <DanielVF> At least we've mostly go games going now
2010-09-28T20:54:22  <troutwine> DanielVF: If it makes you feel better, I submitted patches along with my issues.
2010-09-28T20:54:30  <DanielVF> troutwine thanks
2010-09-28T20:54:56  <troutwine> Sure. I'd feel like a jerk to request simple things and not give patches as well.
2010-09-28T20:55:25  <DanielVF> We are cranking out a game a second now.
2010-09-28T20:55:27  <DanielVF> http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-09-28T20:56:12  <jmcarthur> awesome page
2010-09-28T20:56:32  <jmcarthur> oh wait multiple servers now? i've been out of the loop these last several days
2010-09-28T20:57:16  <jmcarthur> i knew there was some testing, and that's all
2010-09-28T20:57:17  <DanielVF> Yeah, we were using several small ones, but turns out bots need more power
2010-09-28T20:57:34  <jmcarthur> ah :(
2010-09-28T20:57:46  <DanielVF> #7 is an Amazon High CPU Medium

2010-09-28T20:58:06  <jmcarthur> thanks contestbot
2010-09-28T20:58:09  <DanielVF> #8 is a rackspace 1gb ram
2010-09-28T20:58:10  <contestbot> DanielVF: User error, it's not my fault.
2010-09-28T20:58:14  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-28T20:58:26  <DanielVF> with less ram, but possibly more cpu
2010-09-28T20:58:49  <DanielVF> Rackspace lets you use the unused CPU on a physical machine.
2010-09-28T20:58:50  <troutwine> Do bots have a RAM cap?
2010-09-28T20:58:59  <jmcarthur> with these various servers we *really* need to do CPU timing...
2010-09-28T20:59:13  <jmcarthur> with identical virtualized CPUs...
2010-09-28T20:59:14  <DanielVF> So you aren't guaranteed a certain amount of CPU
2010-09-28T20:59:31  <DanielVF> jmcarthur yes. We'll standardize eventualy
2010-09-28T20:59:54  <DanielVF> jmcarthur just learning now.
2010-09-28T20:59:58  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-28T21:01:02  <bhasker> Daniel how many total bots? cause my bot doesn't seem to get more than 2 games every hour:(
2010-09-28T21:01:15  <bhasker> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=5822
2010-09-28T21:01:22  <jmcarthur> as Janzert mentioned on the mailing list, a variety of architectures would also harm my ideal of allowing binary submissions unless we use identical VMs :\
2010-09-28T21:01:48  <DanielVF> bhasker: 2487 submissions
2010-09-28T21:01:50  <DanielVF> *active

2010-09-28T21:01:59  <bhasker> hmm
2010-09-28T21:02:21  <bhasker> so i should be seeing more than 2 games every hour?
2010-09-28T21:02:42  <DanielVF> bhasker: now, yes
2010-09-28T21:02:43  <bhasker> oh wait nm
2010-09-28T21:02:52  <DanielVF> Just brought the second server up
2010-09-28T21:02:56  <bhasker> oh k
2010-09-28T21:03:07  <DanielVF> (had another test server up before that)
2010-09-28T21:03:19  <DanielVF> (So for about three hours there were less games)
2010-09-28T21:04:13  <bhasker> so 60 games /minute is with all 3servers?
2010-09-28T21:04:15  *** rwa <rwa!~rwa@68.65.169.165> has quit IRC (Client Quit)
2010-09-28T21:04:30  <bhasker> that would average to about 3 games per bot per hour right?
2010-09-28T21:04:36  <bhasker> with 2400 odd submissions
2010-09-28T21:05:39  <DanielVF> bhasker Yes
2010-09-28T21:06:04  <bhasker> oh well i will make sure i only submit new bots once a week or so in that case
2010-09-28T21:06:16  <DanielVF> bhasker why?
2010-09-28T21:06:37  <bhasker> cause its taking a full day to climb even 200 spots:-\
2010-09-28T21:07:08  <DanielVF> Ah.
2010-09-28T21:07:19  <bhasker> unless in my own tests my new bot does much better
2010-09-28T21:07:23  <bhasker> i won't submit new bots
2010-09-28T21:09:45  <jmcarthur> the matching algorithm should really take the mean score of a previously submitted bot into consideration when determining the first couple opponents for a new submission
2010-09-28T21:09:52  <jmcarthur> that would make climbing *much* faster
2010-09-28T21:10:04  <DanielVF> jmcarthur Yes.
2010-09-28T21:10:14  <jmcarthur> that is how trueskill is supposed to be used, at least
2010-09-28T21:10:18  <DanielVF> Was trying to think of a non ugly way to do that.
2010-09-28T21:10:28  <jmcarthur> well, how it would be used in an adaptation of it to this contest
2010-09-28T21:10:46  <DanielVF> See as soon as a new submission has played a game
2010-09-28T21:10:54  <DanielVF> it gets a rank based off that game
2010-09-28T21:11:05  <DanielVF> which typicaly is wildly inaccurate
2010-09-28T21:11:09  <jmcarthur> the trueskill way would be to simply leave a bot's mean as is and make its confidence interval larger
2010-09-28T21:11:18  <jmcarthur> upon submission
2010-09-28T21:11:36  <jfrank> hope you are still there... amstan, here are the compiled changes since your last post on the org forum: http://paste-it.net/raw/public/ded50d9/  isn't this just begging for a python script + some sql?
2010-09-28T21:12:04  <DanielVF> jmcarthur All we would realy need is to feed the ranking bot every game by player
2010-09-28T21:12:11  <DanielVF> jmcarthur not just by submission
2010-09-28T21:12:19  <DanielVF> *bayselo
2010-09-28T21:12:31  <DanielVF> but I don't know if that would bork it up
2010-09-28T21:12:45  <jmcarthur> this is why you were investigating iterative algorithms earlier
2010-09-28T21:13:04  <DanielVF> Yes - but the iterative really doesn't work for us
2010-09-28T21:13:12  <jmcarthur> IMO, you might have ruled out trueskill too soon because you didn't test its matchup algorithm in conjunction
2010-09-28T21:13:12  <DanielVF> because of the low number of games we have
2010-09-28T21:13:24  <DanielVF> jm - it's possible

2010-09-28T21:13:52  <DanielVF> bayselo works better because it takes into consideration the bots that the bot you beat have beat, and so on
2010-09-28T21:13:59  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: what existing trueskill library did you test with? i think i might test it myself
2010-09-28T21:14:08  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: trueskill does too

2010-09-28T21:14:30  <jmcarthur> the only thing it lacks is readjusting your score based on later matches by bots you played earlier

2010-09-28T22:18:48  <sigh> bartwe mentioned losing time form programming because of it too
2010-09-28T22:19:13  <jmcarthur> you should try it
2010-09-28T22:19:23  * jmcarthur has a devious plan to distract his opponents

2010-09-28T22:20:16  <Sylph> nice
2010-09-28T22:20:22  <sigh> jmcarthur: ah, so this is your big idea?
2010-09-28T22:21:17  <Sylph> your bot may want to consider defending planet, DanielVF :)
2010-09-28T22:21:18  <jmcarthur> screw haskell. i'm writing my bot with redstone
2010-09-28T22:21:18  <Sylph> and good luck
2010-09-28T22:21:24  <Sylph> lol jmcarthur
2010-09-28T22:21:36  <Sylph> I was going to move to ruby from java, but figured i won't use ruby ever after >.>
2010-09-28T22:21:45  <Sylph> so maybe i'll just use something i often use
2010-09-28T22:21:56  <Sylph> like C#...
2010-09-28T22:22:03  <Sylph> if only they'll just update their mono version...

2010-09-28T22:50:56  <dmj111> ok... wrote a pretty basic, and vague strategy guide.  I'm not much of a blogger, or writer, so this is mostly to break my writers block.  If anyone wants to make suggestions, please do so.  I do hope to write a few more posts with more strategy, algorithms, and coding details (probably just python)

2010-09-28T22:53:25  <davidjliu> looks pretty good
2010-09-28T22:56:27  <dmj111> i appreciate it :)
2010-09-28T22:57:04  <davidjliu> ha, my code is pretty much a giant mess though...
2010-09-28T22:57:49  <dmj111> well... I ignore my own advice for the most part.  Keep up appearances though.

2010-09-28T23:00:12  <sigh> dunno, but I keep losing to him
2010-09-28T23:00:41  <sigh> ah, my bot got a win against felixcoto, that boosted my rank
2010-09-28T23:00:51  <sigh> dmj111: nice work on the strategy guide :)
2010-09-28T23:03:01  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-28T23:03:05  <Sylph> looks pretty good for basic strategy
2010-09-28T23:03:08  <Sylph> might be useful for newcomers
2010-09-28T23:03:17  <Sylph> should be
2010-09-28T23:03:18  <Sylph> i mean
2010-09-28T23:03:41  <sigh> Sylph: don't underestimate it, it's not just for new comers
2010-09-28T23:04:09  <sigh> it is true all those things should be obvious to someone who has been in the comp for a bit
2010-09-28T23:04:31  <sigh> but dmj is hinting at the parts that he considers most important, this is very helpful
2010-09-28T23:04:37  <Sylph> true
2010-09-28T23:04:45  * dmj111 bangs his head on his keyboard
2010-09-28T23:04:55  <sigh> :P
2010-09-28T23:05:00  <Sylph> that might help get things more arranged and structured.
2010-09-28T23:05:11  <Sylph> which always helps
2010-09-28T23:05:46  <Sylph> my dumb java bot always stabilize at just above 300 atm.
2010-09-28T23:06:02  <Sylph> will take a while for my c# rewrite to get submitted though. :/
2010-09-28T23:06:28  <dmj111> i figured I would try to avoid deliberately sharing everything, but that most of it will get out anyway between the lines.

2010-09-28T23:06:56  <Sylph> nice
2010-09-28T23:07:01  <sigh> dmj, my policy has always been taht I'll freely share anything if I think it is common knowledge to the top 10 or so
2010-09-28T23:07:07  <Sylph> syour last bot is much more improved i see, cyndre?
2010-09-28T23:07:16  <Sylph> good policy, sigh
2010-09-28T23:07:17  <sigh> or can easily be determined by looking at the games
2010-09-28T23:07:22  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-28T23:07:38  <Sylph> I mean, knowing the basics won't get you the right constants, etc anyway
2010-09-28T23:07:45  <Cyndre> Sylph: nah, I turned off its attacking - still not as good as it once was
2010-09-28T23:07:50  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-28T23:07:55  <Sylph> score is not rank ?
2010-09-28T23:08:06  <Sylph> rank 124 is like much better than your previous one
2010-09-28T23:08:17  <Sylph> okay
2010-09-28T23:08:17  <Cyndre> thats what CyndreBot_ thinks of my word usage
2010-09-28T23:08:19  <Sylph> i got it now
2010-09-28T23:08:45  <Sylph> I'm rewriting my bots to support future added states if I care to add them
2010-09-28T23:08:46  <dmj111> sigh:  good plan.  Honestly, the odds are pretty even for any of the top N to win, where N could be fairly big.   And this writeup probably won't give the eventual winner a leg up...
2010-09-28T23:08:50  <Sylph> but i probably not bother with those silly state stuff :p
2010-09-28T23:09:04  <dmj111> but maybe it can help the BIGNUM-N who want to have more fun.
2010-09-28T23:09:13  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-28T23:09:14  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-28T23:09:24  <sigh> dmj111: yeah, I didn't mean to imply there was anything special about the top 10, just an arbitrary number

2010-09-28T23:09:31  <Sylph> :p
2010-09-28T23:09:56  <dmj111> oh sure..  didn't mean it that way :)
2010-09-28T23:10:00  <Sylph> I'm rewriting the dumb planetwars.cs from starter package. :/
2010-09-28T23:10:10  <dmj111> too lazy to type 10 when I can type N.

2010-09-28T23:17:06  * Sylph nods
2010-09-28T23:17:09  <sigh> 4 at a time
2010-09-28T23:17:20  <Sylph> I can see that
2010-09-28T23:17:24  <Sylph> i  can probably do the same
2010-09-28T23:17:25  <Sylph> mm
2010-09-28T23:17:48  <Sylph> maybe once i get my bot coded
2010-09-28T23:19:13  <FlagCapper> It
2010-09-28T23:19:17  <FlagCapper> Oops
2010-09-28T23:19:52  <FlagCapper> Didn't actually mean to type that
2010-09-28T23:20:42  <bhasker> i stuck to python because of that
2010-09-28T23:20:48  <bhasker> allows me to prototype stuff fast
2010-09-28T23:20:53  <bhasker> i hate compiling code, do that all day at work!
2010-09-28T23:20:57  <bhasker> don't want to compile more code
2010-09-28T23:21:02  <sigh> haha
2010-09-28T23:21:18  <bhasker> and till now i have had no issues with speed
2010-09-28T23:21:24  <bhasker> so till i start hitting timeouts
2010-09-28T23:21:28  <sigh> yeah, I prefer python as well... as I said, c++ is just a learning  exersize
2010-09-28T23:21:33  <bhasker> i am not bothering writing anything in c++
2010-09-28T23:22:01  <FlagCapper> It takes half a second to compile something of this size
2010-09-28T23:22:07  <FlagCapper> So it's not a big deal
2010-09-28T23:22:14  <FlagCapper> Less if you split up the files
2010-09-28T23:22:46  <sigh> I'm also making as many things as possible config items for my bots, so I can try out variations without recompiling
2010-09-28T23:23:12  <Sylph> I can see that, bhasker
2010-09-28T23:23:32  <Sylph> I've not had much experience with python and ruby, i thought i wanted ruby for learning exercise
2010-09-28T23:23:40  <Sylph> but i don't think I'll be using them much :/
2010-09-28T23:23:48  <sigh> what are you using?
2010-09-28T23:23:50  <Sylph> might as well use something I use more often and i need to derust from
2010-09-28T23:24:04  <Sylph> I use C#
2010-09-28T23:24:08  <Sylph> was using java for a while....
2010-09-28T23:24:15  <sigh> i see
2010-09-28T23:24:31  <dmj111> i tried using c++ and c# for the tron competition... and the remembered I was doing it for fun :)
2010-09-28T23:24:32  <Sylph> Because I wasn't sure if it compile the bots or interpret the codes
2010-09-28T23:24:39  <dmj111> s/the/then/
2010-09-28T23:24:43  <Sylph> :)
2010-09-28T23:24:49  <sigh> :)
2010-09-28T23:25:45  <Sylph> I'm actually going to spend time working on my framework first :/
2010-09-28T23:25:47  <Sylph> before the bot itself
2010-09-28T23:26:00  <Sylph> well, not 'going', was working on that
2010-09-28T23:26:17  <sigh> what do you mean by framework?
2010-09-28T23:26:18  <Sylph> can only go so far with a one function bot that's built by adding stuff to the original bot :p
2010-09-28T23:26:26  <Sylph> just stuff like planetwars.cs, planet.cs, etc, sigh
2010-09-28T23:26:32  <Sylph> I am making them more informative
2010-09-28T23:26:36  <sigh> ok, I understand
2010-09-28T23:26:43  * Sylph nods
2010-09-28T23:26:51  <sigh> yeah, I've re-written mine a bit
2010-09-28T23:27:01  <sigh> plan on doing another overhaul soon
2010-09-28T23:27:04  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-28T23:27:16  <Sylph> you guys need to wait for us to catch up
2010-09-28T23:27:16  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-28T23:27:17  <Sylph> :P
2010-09-28T23:27:18  <Sylph> just kidding
2010-09-28T23:27:22  <dmj111> my first time out, i think ...
2010-09-28T23:27:47  <Sylph> I need to make some 3d models for my class assignments first :/
2010-09-28T23:27:49  <dmj111> maybe a bug or something...
2010-09-28T23:27:53  <Sylph> rather than have fun with this bot, grr
2010-09-28T23:30:03  *** Zeiris <Zeiris!~Zeiris@d206-116-158-135.bchsia.telus.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-28T23:30:22  <sigh> dmj111: blame the server, that's what I do
2010-09-28T23:30:56  <sigh> I've investigated all of my timeouts locally, and they've all been fine locally
2010-09-28T23:31:35  <Sylph> maybe your bot has been too resource consuming on the server
2010-09-28T23:31:47  <Sylph> i mean its easy at home with only one bot running at a time
2010-09-28T23:31:57  <Sylph> don't they have at least multiple matches running at once?
2010-09-28T23:32:30  <sigh> yes, but this is a known problem: http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=807
2010-09-28T23:32:55  <dmj111> sigh: good idea.  I didn't crash when I ran it here, but I am too tired to verify I did it right.
2010-09-28T23:32:57  <dmj111> night all!
2010-09-28T23:33:02  <sigh> night
2010-09-28T23:33:44  <dmj111> looks like I got wounded though, followed it up with a loss to Longing.  as usual.
2010-09-28T23:34:08  *** dmj111 <dmj111!~user@108.15.134.162> has quit IRC (Quit: ERC Version 5.3 (IRC client for Emacs))
2010-09-28T23:34:36  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-28T23:41:02  <sigh> hmm... there's new face in top 10: _iouri_ - http://www.ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=7026
2010-09-28T23:41:10  <sigh> doing well on tcp also
2010-09-28T23:42:06  <Sylph> interesting
2010-09-28T23:42:16  <Sylph> yeah very nice
2010-09-28T23:43:02  <Sylph> interestingly his bot seems he focuses on bigger planets like my bot hrm
2010-09-28T23:43:08  <Sylph> nm about the first half of that esntence
2010-09-28T23:43:11  <Sylph> was writing something else
2010-09-28T23:43:33  <sigh> no worries, I do that all the itme
2010-09-28T23:43:35  <sigh> *time
2010-09-28T23:44:11  <Sylph> he definitely build front line planets though
2010-09-28T23:44:16  <Sylph> rather than just attack using them
2010-09-28T23:44:31  <Sylph> mine hasn't been updated to do that, but kinda rewriting from scratch anyway
2010-09-28T23:45:56  <sigh> his bot's tactics seem very similar to mine
2010-09-28T23:46:08  <sigh> not sure if that's just superficial
2010-09-28T23:46:14  <Sylph> not sure
2010-09-28T23:46:18  <Sylph> let me see yours again
2010-09-28T23:46:26  <Sylph> i go check current ranking :p
2010-09-28T23:47:01  <Sylph> I think his bot is less aggressive than yours
2010-09-28T23:47:08  <sigh> I expand more readily
2010-09-28T23:47:11  * Sylph nods
2010-09-28T23:47:24  <Sylph> he seems to like building forces
2010-09-28T23:47:38  <Sylph> like in http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4928477 he build up forces in the red planet in the middle
2010-09-28T23:47:45  <Sylph> well, that's the most apparent one
2010-09-28T23:49:17  <sigh> I build up forces too: http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4933185
2010-09-28T23:49:24  * Sylph watches
2010-09-28T23:49:25  <Sylph> true
2010-09-28T23:49:39  <Sylph> i guess if you don't you can't get top 25 spots
2010-09-28T23:49:41  <Sylph> probably
2010-09-28T23:50:14  <sigh> although _iouri_ waits for more ships than me before attacking
2010-09-28T23:50:18  * Sylph nods
2010-09-28T23:50:59  <sigh> all the top bots build forces to some extent... simple consequence of moving all ships to the front
2010-09-28T23:51:01  <Sylph> so many bugs on my current bot  I can fix
2010-09-28T23:51:02  <Sylph> but like gah :/
2010-09-28T23:51:07  <Sylph> i need to do other things first
2010-09-28T23:51:08  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-28T23:51:12  <Sylph> I mean i am rewriting anyway
2010-09-28T23:51:12  <sigh> Sylph: we've all been there
2010-09-28T23:51:21  * Sylph nods
2010-09-28T23:51:38  <Sylph> Like why bother wasting time on my old java bot when i'm writing a much improved bot that takes into account all that. :/
2010-09-28T23:51:47  <sigh> heh
2010-09-28T23:51:56  <Sylph> takes longer though :p
2010-09-28T23:52:04  <Sylph> writing from scratch that take into account all that, compared to just fixing the leaky boat
2010-09-28T23:52:11  <Sylph> one by one
2010-09-28T23:52:28  <sigh> :)
2010-09-28T23:52:39  <Sylph> _iouri games is impressive
2010-09-28T23:52:43  <Sylph> only one loss
2010-09-28T23:52:58  <sigh> yup
2010-09-28T23:53:04  <Sylph> are
