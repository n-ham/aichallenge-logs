2010-12-30T05:32:33  <delt0r___> for the general public
2010-12-30T05:33:35  <delt0r___> personally I think adding local storage with 4k entries will be something quite taxing on hardware... unless some *very* hard limits are placed on how much is stored...
2010-12-30T05:34:26  <delt0r___> Or perhaps just have a 24 "save game replay" snapshot avalible for download...

2010-12-30T18:51:29  <jmcarthur> IMO, if it *appears* to be intelligent, it's AI, even if it doesn't actually learn over time
2010-12-30T18:52:16  <jmcarthur> also IMO, AI that learns usually won't do as well as AI that's handwritten for a task, and AI that learns tends to be a bit more boring because of it
2010-12-30T18:52:55  <sigh> wow... this is the slowest conversation I've ever seen on IRC
2010-12-30T18:56:18  <sigh> for what it's worth, I agree with jmcarthur here... AI should be defined by what is achieved rather than the implementation details
2010-12-30T18:56:55  <sigh> I like the wikipedia definition: "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.
