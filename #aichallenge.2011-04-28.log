2011-04-28T02:35:23  <antimatroid> the lolcode bot :P
2011-04-28T02:35:54  <antimatroid> atm it should be reusable across contests?
2011-04-28T02:36:56  <antimatroid> it would be cool to make a game where the engine generated rules and there was a format for passing them to the bots at the start of the game
2011-04-28T02:37:04  <antimatroid> or maps were game rules
2011-04-28T02:37:08  <antimatroid> with a map
2011-04-28T02:37:17  <jaycobcoleman> that'd be pretty sweet
2011-04-28T02:37:33  <jaycobcoleman> pretty hard to write a bot for though
2011-04-28T02:37:33  <antimatroid> generic program game creation
2011-04-28T02:38:04  <jaycobcoleman> I actually quite like that idea
2011-04-28T02:38:21  <jaycobcoleman> it becomes about creating a bot that knows what the hell it's trying to do
2011-04-28T02:39:14  <antimatroid> one thing might be how varied the size of the state spaces are allowed to be
2011-04-28T02:39:33  <antimatroid> i think i could write a pretty good general bot

2011-04-28T02:39:49  <antimatroid> you'd need to know when to fall back on heuristics though
2011-04-28T02:39:56  <antimatroid> and generalising those might not be so simple
2011-04-28T02:39:56  <jaycobcoleman> I think I'd have to do some serious fiddling first :)
2011-04-28T02:40:26  <antimatroid> after writing a few ai bots it's a bit easier to think through things
2011-04-28T02:40:37  <antimatroid> like actual contest length ones, not starter bots
2011-04-28T02:40:59  <jaycobcoleman> yeah I need to get on some real bot creation
2011-04-28T02:41:12  <antimatroid> you have much more of an idea than I did at the start of tron
2011-04-28T02:41:29  <jaycobcoleman> I have more ideas than I can count and I know how to implement most of them
2011-04-28T02:41:33  <antimatroid> minus any game theory, but i hadn't programmed a game tree before
2011-04-28T02:41:36  <jaycobcoleman> just not how to fit them all together
2011-04-28T02:41:43  <antimatroid> time is a big problem
2011-04-28T02:41:51  <antimatroid> i had lots of wild ideas for planet wars that weren't feasible
2011-04-28T02:42:03  <antimatroid> getting anything from game trees in this is going to be very hard due to the number of ants
2011-04-28T02:42:05  <jaycobcoleman> I've been alright on time so far
2011-04-28T02:42:24  <antimatroid> if you stay with heuristics and use a timer you should be fine
2011-04-28T02:42:37  <antimatroid> but any kind of game representation blows out much faster than you would expect
2011-04-28T02:42:41  <jaycobcoleman> My only game theory experience comes from the show numb3rs
2011-04-28T02:42:47  <jaycobcoleman> which isn't 100% accurate on math
2011-04-28T02:42:48  <antimatroid> that show is awful
2011-04-28T02:42:57  <jaycobcoleman> I agree :/
2011-04-28T02:43:03  <jaycobcoleman> I liked it early on
2011-04-28T02:44:08  <jaycobcoleman> The pseudo-math really started to bother me as my brain developed
2011-04-28T02:46:27  <antimatroid> wait till you do some actual maths :P
2011-04-28T02:47:12  <antimatroid> imo if the course isn't being taught with definitions/theorems etc. it isn't being taught right
2011-04-28T02:48:09  <jaycobcoleman> How would ants be classified in game theory?
2011-04-28T02:48:25  <jaycobcoleman> I imagine simultaneous, imperfect information, zero sum?
2011-04-28T02:48:32  <antimatroid> it's not zero sum
2011-04-28T02:48:44  <jaycobcoleman> this is true
2011-04-28T02:48:47  <jaycobcoleman> what is it?
2011-04-28T02:48:53  <antimatroid> the set of simultaneous games is isomorphic to the set of sequential games
2011-04-28T02:49:11  <antimatroid> that is each simultaneous game has an equivalent representation as a sequential game and vice versa
2011-04-28T02:49:17  <jaycobcoleman> mhm
2011-04-28T02:49:37  <antimatroid> but i think i would really treat it as an extensive form game with imperfect information
2011-04-28T02:49:55  <antimatroid> imperfect information because of the simultaneous moves each turn, not the fog of war
2011-04-28T02:50:11  <antimatroid> or maybe you could treat it as a multistage game
2011-04-28T02:50:20  <antimatroid> which is like a game tree where you have a simultaneous game at each node

2011-04-28T02:51:08  <jaycobcoleman> I understand the extensive game idea, but not the simultaneous at each node
2011-04-28T02:51:13  <antimatroid> if i treat it as a game, i plan to treat is as a zero sum game "me vs. the rest" each turn using a simultaneous representation and either pick the strategy that maximises the minimum of the row or work out some kind of minimax regret function
2011-04-28T02:51:27  <antimatroid> you know what a simultaneous game is?
2011-04-28T02:51:46  <antimatroid> just plonk one of those at each node, the non-terminal outcomes have branches leading to another game
2011-04-28T02:51:51  <jaycobcoleman> where everyone moves at the same time without knowledge of each other's moves I assune
2011-04-28T02:51:53  <jaycobcoleman> *assime
2011-04-28T02:51:56  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-28T02:52:00  <jaycobcoleman> I'm terrible at typing
2011-04-28T02:52:15  <antimatroid> then imagine playing one of those, and each of the "outcomes" leading to another simultaneous game
2011-04-28T02:52:35  <antimatroid> except if the "outcome" is terminal at which point you specify payoffs
2011-04-28T02:52:57  <antimatroid> it needs to be a tree for multistage games though
2011-04-28T02:53:03  <antimatroid> so you can't have a graph
2011-04-28T02:53:10  <antimatroid> well, a non-tree graph :P
2011-04-28T02:54:31  <jaycobcoleman> that sounds complicated :P I'm sure you've addressed this, but would the outcome of the game at each of the nodes be related to the outcomes of those around it?
2011-04-28T02:55:01  <antimatroid> not generally i don't think
2011-04-28T02:55:15  <antimatroid> well very generally i am pretty sure no
2011-04-28T02:55:23  <antimatroid> for ants i don't think so
2011-04-28T02:55:50  <jaycobcoleman> So how do ants being near one-another affect the outcome of the game?
2011-04-28T02:56:14  <antimatroid> the strategies don't necessarily give that though
2011-04-28T02:56:31  <antimatroid> and even then it'd be quite complicated i think
2011-04-28T02:56:59  <jaycobcoleman> hmm. Maybe I just don't entirely understand. My concern was that it might be order dependant
2011-04-28T02:57:37  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-04-28T02:58:51  <jaycobcoleman> the outcome of each game would be dependent upon information from other games, so if it didn't yet have information about the outcome of some of the games it would have a different outcome than if those had been evaluated first
2011-04-28T02:59:35  <antimatroid> do you know how to do backward induction on a game tree to find subgame perfect nash equilibrium?
2011-04-28T02:59:46  <jaycobcoleman> indeed I do not
2011-04-28T02:59:52  <antimatroid> that's a mouthful, you just start from the bottom nodes and pick what the player would choose, and keep working your way back up
2011-04-28T03:00:19  <antimatroid> any strategies that have arrows leading to a terminal node essentially give you the terminal nodes that can result from this
2011-04-28T03:00:40  <antimatroid> with zero sum games it's cool because you can ensure you do no worse than what's predicted (in that if the player plays not-rationally, then you only do better)
2011-04-28T03:00:53  <antimatroid> generally you don't have that property, making backward induction a lot harder for people in ants
2011-04-28T03:01:03  <jaycobcoleman> oh I see. Wouldn't that require a bit more time though?
2011-04-28T03:01:10  <antimatroid> well, not necessarily harder to do, but they have a few choices and no obvious best choice
2011-04-28T03:01:28  <antimatroid> one cool thing is that your decision sort of reflects how much you're willing to cooperate with enemies
2011-04-28T03:01:51  <antimatroid> although to do that well you'd really want to use a tit-for-tat strategy to not try and cooperate with stupid bots and non-cooperative bots
2011-04-28T03:02:03  <jaycobcoleman> I'm not gonna depend on others' bots too much :/
2011-04-28T03:02:12  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm not cooperating
2011-04-28T03:02:24  <antimatroid> it's a cool aspect, but i don't expect enough people to attempt it
2011-04-28T03:02:24  <jaycobcoleman> I like the idea of treating it as an extensive form game much better :)
2011-04-28T03:02:35  <antimatroid> they are equivalent :P
2011-04-28T03:03:08  <antimatroid> i was going to do a tree because i like that, but then the way i reduced it, it was just easier/faster to treat it as the simultaneous version
2011-04-28T03:03:11  <jaycobcoleman> But I understand the concept of an extensive form game than creating games at every node
2011-04-28T03:03:22  <antimatroid> you don't create a game at every node
2011-04-28T03:03:36  <antimatroid> the entire tree is one game, you implement moves at each node
2011-04-28T03:03:42  <antimatroid> then evaluate the states at the terminal nodes
2011-04-28T03:04:11  <jaycobcoleman> :) I'll get it eventually

2011-04-28T03:07:19  <antimatroid> like i said before though, game trees will be hard in this
2011-04-28T03:07:45  <antimatroid> you either need to consider like 2 moves from each ant, significantly prune as you generate or only do a few ants at a time
2011-04-28T03:08:10  <antimatroid> i might try and keep battles near water :P
2011-04-28T03:08:13  <antimatroid> minimise the number of moves
2011-04-28T03:08:45  <antimatroid> actually, that could be quite interesting
2011-04-28T03:08:51  <antimatroid> some bots lining themselves against walls
2011-04-28T03:08:58  <antimatroid> and people having to fight and pass around it
2011-04-28T03:09:02  <antimatroid> because it's not worth attacking them
2011-04-28T03:09:11  <antimatroid> against water*
2011-04-28T03:09:55  <antimatroid> it will be cool watching attackers invade campers
2011-04-28T03:10:05  <antimatroid> i just hope to god the attackers are able to win out
2011-04-28T03:10:10  <antimatroid> it'll be a rather boring competition otherwise
2011-04-28T03:10:56  <jaycobcoleman> haha I considered locating cutoff points and blocking off all but one that are visible with formations of ants which line the edge of a battle radius
2011-04-28T03:10:59  <antimatroid> actually,follow my previous thought
2011-04-28T03:11:18  <antimatroid> if camping reigns at the start, people are going to try to "grow" and claim as much land to parition the map
2011-04-28T03:11:21  <antimatroid> then not fight each other
2011-04-28T03:11:33  <antimatroid> but then you're going to start trying to send ants out early to claim the edges
2011-04-28T03:11:49  <antimatroid> which could lead to an oscillation of best strategies
2011-04-28T03:12:02  <antimatroid> where the campers and attackers gradually work out how to outdo each other
2011-04-28T03:12:03  <jaycobcoleman> that'd be obnoxious
2011-04-28T03:12:09  <antimatroid> that'd be awesome
2011-04-28T03:12:16  <jaycobcoleman> meh
2011-04-28T03:12:31  <jaycobcoleman> actually I don't know
2011-04-28T03:12:46  <jaycobcoleman> I honestly don't think I'd have too much trouble thwarting campers
2011-04-28T03:12:56  <antimatroid> if "corridor" blocking is a problem, we will remove small corridors from the maps
2011-04-28T03:13:03  <antimatroid> yeah neither
2011-04-28T03:13:15  <antimatroid> we've picked the rules to try and make sure camping isn't the best strategy
2011-04-28T03:13:25  <jaycobcoleman> Yeah I've noticed
2011-04-28T03:13:46  <antimatroid> sure camping is a valid strategy, but it wouldn't be a particularly interesting ai contest
2011-04-28T03:13:52  <antimatroid> so hence the rule decisions
2011-04-28T03:14:15  <jaycobcoleman> giving points for food is a dangerous decision, but still one I'm happy about
2011-04-28T03:15:33  <jaycobcoleman> Here's an idea. We could spawn food in such a way that it tends to spawn away from ants
2011-04-28T03:15:42  <jaycobcoleman> further from large groupings than single ants
2011-04-28T03:16:17  <jaycobcoleman> That way if an area is staked out fewer food squares will spawn there
2011-04-28T03:16:42  <jaycobcoleman> providing incentive to move ants around
2011-04-28T03:17:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold and I had a fairly lengthy discussion about what it does to strategies for giving those points
2011-04-28T03:17:30  <antimatroid> i don't want food spawning to be affected by ant locations (much)
2011-04-28T03:17:55  <antimatroid> (much) because of the fact that a food square may wait to spawn until an ant moves off it
2011-04-28T03:18:01  <antimatroid> but that is mostly only hurtful to that ant
2011-04-28T03:18:06  <antimatroid> if they don't move
2011-04-28T03:18:27  <antimatroid> that's another thing, people wont want static campers
2011-04-28T03:18:33  <antimatroid> because food will wait to spawn there
2011-04-28T03:18:40  <antimatroid> at least for symmetric maps
2011-04-28T03:18:40  <jaycobcoleman> if camping becomes a problem then the answer definitely lies in food placement
2011-04-28T03:19:05  <antimatroid> camping isn't necessarily sitting still though
2011-04-28T03:19:06  <jaycobcoleman> not necessarily with that solution (I think we could do better), but somehow
2011-04-28T03:19:11  <antimatroid> you can just have your ants avoid battles
2011-04-28T03:19:13  <antimatroid> and roam
2011-04-28T03:19:45  <antimatroid> ah crap, i need mcleopld
2011-04-28T03:19:56  <jaycobcoleman> whyzat?
2011-04-28T03:20:15  <antimatroid> it depends on how easily an ant can avoid battles
2011-04-28T03:20:35  <jaycobcoleman> it'd be pretty damn easy
2011-04-28T03:20:39  <antimatroid> we'll see in the beta period
2011-04-28T03:20:45  <antimatroid> i'll make such a bot and hope it can be outdone
2011-04-28T03:21:03  <jaycobcoleman> I'll do the same. I think I kind of did already
2011-04-28T03:21:08  <jaycobcoleman> I don't really remember :P
2011-04-28T03:21:13  <antimatroid> we could always up the value of a dead ant
2011-04-28T03:21:28  <jaycobcoleman> Or decrease vision distance
2011-04-28T03:21:34  <jaycobcoleman> it's pretty large right now
2011-04-28T03:21:41  <jaycobcoleman> or at least what's been discussed
2011-04-28T03:21:43  <antimatroid> we already ddi
2011-04-28T03:21:53  <antimatroid> it's down to view2 = 55
2011-04-28T03:21:57  <antimatroid> i don't want to go smaller
2011-04-28T03:22:13  <jaycobcoleman> yeah that's pretty good
2011-04-28T03:22:40  <jaycobcoleman> alright, let's make some WussyBots! I'm gonna go take a shower
2011-04-28T03:22:46  <jaycobcoleman> goodbye
2011-04-28T03:22:52  <antimatroid> i can't program bots tonight
2011-04-28T03:23:00  <jaycobcoleman> yeah neither can I
2011-04-28T03:23:03  <jaycobcoleman> as I said, shower
2011-04-28T03:23:11  <jaycobcoleman> and it's already 11:30
2011-04-28T03:23:25  <jaycobcoleman> so probably not tonight

2011-04-28T04:44:36  <stocha> antimatroid: if no first seen land, then r line really don't make sense.
2011-04-28T04:45:37  <stocha> however, i never found that camping was an option in my testing. Even trying to avoid others ennemy ants is really a sure path to loosing.
2011-04-28T04:46:08  <stocha> The less the view radius, the more randomness is in the game.
2011-04-28T04:46:29  <stocha> Simply because you have to make choice with much fewer information.
2011-04-28T04:47:18  <stocha> At this point, i believe that the ant game will be mostly heuristic based. Because it features a large space, and very few cpu time.
2011-04-28T04:47:56  <stocha> But heuristic will be hugely impacted by small variation into the rules and map/food topology distribution.
2011-04-28T04:48:43  <stocha> Wich means that as long as you can't know what the view radius/fight radius, score method, map/food topology will be, you have to make bet about the heuristic you choose to implement.

2011-04-28T04:50:09  <stocha> Spawning food away from ant position is a choice. Spawning food away from large ant cluster is not good though. because clustering is such a hit on food gathering in the first place.

2011-04-28T05:02:09  <mcstar> my two cents: 1: the bot needs to avoid battle as long as possible, 2: it needs to attack at least in pairs
2011-04-28T05:02:42  <antimatroid> what's "as long as possible"?
2011-04-28T05:02:57  <mcstar> depends on the number of max turns
2011-04-28T05:03:09  <mcstar> and the size of the discovered territory
2011-04-28T05:03:28  <antimatroid> i would like to see a lot less food than games have been using so far
2011-04-28T05:03:33  <antimatroid> the maps get flooded
2011-04-28T05:03:47  <mcstar> oh, will the maps get bigger?
2011-04-28T05:04:20  <mcstar> ive only see so far the vsualization on hypertriangle
2011-04-28T05:04:31  <mcstar> and it is  small map
2011-04-28T05:04:48  <antimatroid> or at least some games where there are way less ants
2011-04-28T05:04:48  <antimatroid> so you get more interesting groups
2011-04-28T05:04:48  <antimatroid> rather than a page of mess
2011-04-28T05:05:07  <antimatroid> it's capped at 256
2011-04-28T05:05:12  <antimatroid> but i don't see them getting much bigger than now
2011-04-28T05:05:18  <mcstar> 256x256?
2011-04-28T05:05:38  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-28T05:05:47  <mcstar> but it was rectangular
2011-04-28T05:05:49  <mcstar> nevermind
2011-04-28T05:07:16  <mcstar> i have an idea
2011-04-28T05:07:26  <mcstar> maybe after a battle of 2 ants
2011-04-28T05:07:33  <mcstar> they shouldnt die
2011-04-28T05:07:42  <mcstar> but leave a zombia ant behind
2011-04-28T05:07:47  <mcstar> or a food cube
2011-04-28T05:07:59  <mcstar> and u spawn that much less food on the map
2011-04-28T05:08:18  <mcstar> and if one ant comes close it will get a buddyű

2011-04-28T05:19:52  <mcstar> the canonical way of getting the starter bot is using git right?
2011-04-28T05:20:06  <mcstar> f, one more thing to learn
2011-04-28T05:20:55  <mcstar> i saw a google talks video with Linus, explaining why GIT is wonderful and why everything else sucked
2011-04-28T05:21:21  <mcstar> i wasnt especially encouraged at the end to use it
2011-04-28T05:26:04  <Ice_Harley> just hit "Download file" at github and forget about this git
2011-04-28T05:27:38  <mcstar> does it download everything or just the directory im watching?

2011-04-28T05:32:31  <mcstar> ah
2011-04-28T05:32:56  <mcstar> in ArchLinux the python 2.7 interpreter is called python2
2011-04-28T05:33:03  <mcstar> python is python 3.2
2011-04-28T05:33:15  <mcstar> just a note
2011-04-28T05:38:55  <Frontier> mcstar: You can probably configure the default (python) to point either to python2 or python3
2011-04-28T05:39:37  <janzert> it'll probably break OS scripts then
2011-04-28T05:39:49  <mcstar> if you mean backup /usr/bin/python and make a symlink
2011-04-28T05:39:54  <mcstar> yes, i can do that
2011-04-28T05:40:05  <mcstar> wont break anything
2011-04-28T05:40:19  <mcstar> nothing uses python3 as far as i know
2011-04-28T05:40:21  <janzert> Arch has ignored the recommendations of python developers and made usr/bin/python point to python3
2011-04-28T05:40:39  <janzert> all the arch packages expect it from my understanding
2011-04-28T05:40:53  <janzert> /usr/bin/python as python3 that is
2011-04-28T05:41:06  <mcstar> i cant think of one example which uses python3
2011-04-28T05:41:25  <mcstar> in fact i could remove it if i wanted
2011-04-28T05:42:03  <janzert> ok, just remember that you changed it if stuff breaks in the future :)
2011-04-28T05:42:07  <mcstar> last year december i was suprised when my scripts started to break though
2011-04-28T05:42:24  <mcstar> the TARNSITION begun that time
2011-04-28T05:42:47  <mcstar> i dont know what those packagers ate to make this decision
2011-04-28T05:42:52  <mcstar> lsd trip?
2011-04-28T05:42:55  <Frontier> ok, all i know from using gentoo is that the default there is python2, but you can use the system's configuration tool to switch between both versions. scripts that depend on either version can still call python2 or python3.
2011-04-28T05:43:33  <mcstar> i see, but i have know knowledge of such config options in Arch
2011-04-28T05:43:41  <mcstar> know-yno

2011-04-28T05:54:09  <Frontier> did you notice that in the remake there was always a sense of up and down in outer space? the ship had a roll and nick indicator, there was gravity on the decks, ships were never seen in odd angles to each other (not even cylon ships towards the human fleet)
2011-04-28T05:54:52  <Frontier> that is a good idea, but not as good as watching real ants
2011-04-28T05:55:20  <mcstar> did you notice that anything that explodes in space had a sort of accretion disk ? which selects a plane in 3d?
2011-04-28T05:55:49  <mcstar> and it coincides with the viewers horizon usually
2011-04-28T05:56:23  <mcstar> i watch scifi for the phylosiphical dilemmas and action
2011-04-28T05:56:37  <Frontier> start here for example :): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXaaTQztoI0
2011-04-28T05:57:06  <mcstar> doesnt load :(
2011-04-28T05:57:29  <mcstar> lets kill mr. torrent

2011-04-28T05:57:50  <Frontier> mcstar: yes you are right about the explosions, but I often think that the creators of sci-fi movies know better
2011-04-28T05:59:01  <Frontier> even in bsg they tried to simulate a few things correctly, but only if it wouldn't look better don wrong ^^
2011-04-28T05:59:39  <mcstar> the explosion i descibed fits this
2011-04-28T05:59:52  <mcstar> an even explosion expanding like a sphere
2011-04-28T06:00:02  <mcstar> isnt that much fun to watch
2011-04-28T06:00:03  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-28T06:00:22  <Frontier> and soundless space is also quite boring
2011-04-28T06:00:29  <mcstar> yep
2011-04-28T06:00:45  <mcstar> i dont mind in starwars every ship is like a diesel engine
2011-04-28T06:00:55  <Frontier> rofl
2011-04-28T06:01:19  <mcstar> have u seen farscape?
2011-04-28T06:01:28  <mcstar> theres an episode
2011-04-28T06:01:30  <mcstar> The Flux
2011-04-28T06:01:32  <Frontier> no
2011-04-28T06:01:40  <mcstar> and theres a salvage ship
2011-04-28T06:01:52  <mcstar> which actually is like a steam-engine
2011-04-28T06:02:07  <mcstar> of course it doesnt use steam or coal

2011-04-28T06:02:23  <mcstar> but theryre burning contraband articles
2011-04-28T06:02:31  <mcstar> to heat up something to prpell the ship
2011-04-28T06:02:45  <mcstar> its quite a streach
2011-04-28T06:02:54  <mcstar> farscape is like CRAZY
2011-04-28T06:03:05  <mcstar> i highly recommaned it
2011-04-28T06:03:53  <stocha> when i was younger i had an explanation to starwars deep space sounds.
2011-04-28T06:04:37  <stocha> The ship hull as captors that transform some input into sounds, for compactness of information. So that the pilot get packed informations into this.
2011-04-28T06:04:59  <stocha> Obviously the spectator receive the same information.
2011-04-28T06:05:22  <stocha> It can apply to most sci fi.
2011-04-28T06:06:31  <mcstar> o.O
2011-04-28T06:06:52  <stocha> what ? doesn't sound like it could be ?
2011-04-28T06:07:06  <mcstar> u  mean like radar information is embedded in the diesel noise?
2011-04-28T06:07:08  <stocha> or my english syntax is so poor it's ununderstandable :p
2011-04-28T06:07:23  <stocha> yeah sure. makes sense. And also ship drive signature.
2011-04-28T06:07:24  <mcstar> i had a hard time with ur second line :)
2011-04-28T06:07:36  <stocha> Imagine you are a pilot
2011-04-28T06:07:53  <mcstar> got it
2011-04-28T06:07:57  <Frontier> Farscape was probably not on free tv channels in Germany. Otherwise I cannot explain I've never come across it
2011-04-28T06:07:59  <stocha> it's good to able to locate tie fighter by the directionnal sound of their engine. And also know where the xwings are.
2011-04-28T06:08:40  <stocha> Fontier: you monitor all tv channel all the time ? :p
2011-04-28T06:08:43  <mcstar> (they aired it even here in hungary on free broadcast)
2011-04-28T06:09:01  <stocha> servus.
2011-04-28T06:09:09  <Frontier> no, but statistically you know...
2011-04-28T06:09:30  <stocha> My hungarian is quite limited. to say the least. My daughters are half hungarians.
2011-04-28T06:09:50  <mcstar> szia
2011-04-28T06:09:56  <stocha> 25% hungarian in fact. but well. The mother is trying to speak that at home :p
2011-04-28T06:10:12  <stocha> I should really take some time some day, to get a basis.

2011-04-28T06:13:29  <stocha> I should go on the a hungarian tchat
2011-04-28T06:13:30  <stocha> probably
2011-04-28T06:13:39  <stocha> then i could learn some stuff. where should i go ?
2011-04-28T06:13:44  <mcstar> i learned deutsch for 6 yeaRS at least
2011-04-28T06:13:59  <stocha> do you know a good and popular hungarian chat site ?
2011-04-28T06:13:59  <mcstar> well i dont know
2011-04-28T06:14:02  <mcstar> i dont chat :)
2011-04-28T06:14:07  <stocha> yeah. nobody do.
2011-04-28T06:14:14  <mcstar> i just irc with my buddies
2011-04-28T06:14:21  <mcstar> and some other channels
2011-04-28T06:14:25  <mcstar> but its international
2011-04-28T06:14:38  <mcstar> read online newspapers
2011-04-28T06:14:44  <mcstar> thats the way to start
2011-04-28T06:15:23  <stocha> i don't like to read. i mean it's boring. I need to have real people to get motivated. and a computer. so chat seems a good idea.
2011-04-28T06:15:41  <mcstar> fair enough
2011-04-28T06:16:14  <stocha> Like the chat of starwars fan site maybe. i don't know how to google that obviously.
2011-04-28T06:16:36  <mcstar> theres a change they call themselves that
2011-04-28T06:16:51  <stocha> ?
2011-04-28T06:16:59  <mcstar> starwars fan site
2011-04-28T06:17:20  <mcstar> just make sure google lists the hungarian domain
2011-04-28T06:17:20  <stocha> yeah, but hungarian only starwars fan site.
2011-04-28T06:17:54  <mcstar> http://www.mateherbert.gportal.hu/
2011-04-28T06:18:16  <stocha> like that : http://www.starwars.hu/center/index.php

2011-04-28T06:19:50  <mcstar> i found some
2011-04-28T06:19:56  <mcstar> on IRCnet
2011-04-28T06:20:00  <mcstar> theres a channel
2011-04-28T06:20:08  <mcstar> #starwars.hu
2011-04-28T06:21:35  <stocha> i don't have irc. irronically :p i use the web client they gave the url off.
2011-04-28T06:21:45  <stocha> maybe it's time to install it though. mgn
2011-04-28T06:21:45  <mcstar> oh
2011-04-28T06:21:58  <mcstar> im sure ircnet has webchat too

2011-04-28T06:22:34  <stocha> i just realized i still have the hungarian assimil method in my desk tirroir.
2011-04-28T06:22:53  <mcstar> im sorry i dont understand
2011-04-28T06:23:08  <mcstar> whats assimil method? whats desk tirroir?
2011-04-28T06:23:13  <stocha> a book to learn hungarian was right into my desk.
2011-04-28T06:23:19  <mcstar> ah
2011-04-28T06:23:23  <stocha> for a year it has been apparently.
2011-04-28T06:23:32  <stocha> i forgot it was there.
2011-04-28T06:23:48  <mcstar> i cant imagine how hungarian sounds to a starnger
2011-04-28T06:23:52  <mcstar> im soo curious
2011-04-28T06:24:48  <stocha> to a french it sounds like a foreign langage :p
2011-04-28T06:25:09  <stocha> it seems to be difficult to grab.
2011-04-28T06:25:29  <stocha> szep ido von.

2011-04-28T06:26:15  <mcstar> they are?
2011-04-28T06:26:21  <mcstar> i didnt know that either :)
2011-04-28T06:26:26  <stocha> i have received very few encouragement for learning.
2011-04-28T06:26:38  <stocha> yet you seems very supporting :)
2011-04-28T06:26:44  <Frontier> I see latin letters and try to apply known phonetics from germanic / roman languages to it, but most often this is totally wrong I guess.
2011-04-28T06:27:05  <mcstar> to speak hungarian is actually very easy
2011-04-28T06:27:29  <stocha> yeah. when you learn as a child. That's why i insist that my wife trys to speak that at home.
2011-04-28T06:27:30  <mcstar> u pronounce exactly what is written
2011-04-28T06:27:36  <Frontier> but you have é and õ :-/
2011-04-28T06:27:50  <mcstar> once u know how to pronounce é ő, c,s
2011-04-28T06:27:54  <mcstar> these letters
2011-04-28T06:27:59  <mcstar> u r almost done
2011-04-28T06:28:07  <mcstar> but i gtg for a minute
2011-04-28T06:28:17  <stocha> you only have to learn all the gramatical rules and exception. and you are good to go.
2011-04-28T06:28:41  <Frontier> mcstar: you sound like daniel jackson in the stargate movie
2011-04-28T06:28:58  <Frontier> "Once you know the vocals it is pretty easy" or something ^^

2011-04-28T06:31:30  <stocha> nem tudom. i think it means "i don't know". But could be "i don't understand" It's really been a while since last time i trie to work with hungarian :p

2011-04-28T06:36:17  <mcstar> and i didnt say hungarian is easy
2011-04-28T06:36:22  <stocha> i think you just made me in the mood to try again. Maybe i'll just try to be able to read it a bit. Rather than trying to understand what people says.
2011-04-28T06:36:26  <mcstar> i think the oppposite is true
2011-04-28T06:36:48  <mcstar> if i werent born hun. i dont think i would ever try to speak it
2011-04-28T06:37:06  <mcstar> i just said that pronounciations is easy
2011-04-28T06:37:09  <mcstar> we say that
2011-04-28T06:37:10  <stocha> but i want my little girls to speak it.
2011-04-28T06:37:22  <mcstar> ahogy írjuk úgy ejtjük
2011-04-28T06:37:31  <mcstar> which means
2011-04-28T06:37:48  <mcstar> as we write it the way we say it
2011-04-28T06:38:04  <stocha> that's a good thing. French is nasty for that.
2011-04-28T06:38:22  <stocha> i'm happy i don't have to learn it as a foreign langage.
2011-04-28T06:38:29  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-28T06:38:59  <mcstar> im thinking about learning french
2011-04-28T06:39:05  <mcstar> but this is as far as i got
2011-04-28T06:39:08  <stocha> don't :p
2011-04-28T06:39:16  <mcstar> it sounds nice
2011-04-28T06:39:51  <mcstar> zsö nö sza pö
2011-04-28T06:40:05  <stocha> once you know to speak it, you have to learn to write it. And vice versa.
2011-04-28T06:40:28  <mcstar> yeah, thats hard i guess
2011-04-28T06:40:29  <mcstar> look
2011-04-28T06:40:31  <Frontier> thank god there is internet slang
2011-04-28T06:40:38  <stocha> zso no sza po means it sounds nice ?
2011-04-28T06:40:38  <mcstar> ive got an ant crwling towards my keyboard
2011-04-28T06:40:49  <Frontier> plus = +, moins = -, lu = salut :p

2011-04-28T06:41:20  <mcstar> je ne sais pas=zsö nö sza pé
2011-04-28T06:41:22  <stocha> lost of french can understand international english.
2011-04-28T06:41:27  <Frontier> if it finds food it will replicate!
2011-04-28T06:41:40  <stocha> especially those you may encounter on internationals forums :p
2011-04-28T06:42:12  <mcstar> when u write down the pronounciation of (je ne sais pas) u get (zsö nö sza pé)
2011-04-28T06:42:13  <Frontier> so hungarian is a lot like french?
2011-04-28T06:42:43  <mcstar> in the sense that people speak it :)
2011-04-28T06:42:45  <stocha> If it finds food, it will put in a pheromon, accordingly to statisticall rules that in no time will build a ant column going from colony to food using the shortest path.
2011-04-28T06:42:58  <stocha> ant shortest path heuristic is very good indeed.

2011-04-28T06:46:27  <stocha> it's a sort of phonetic writing frontier
2011-04-28T06:46:31  <mcstar> yes
2011-04-28T06:46:32  <stocha> don't think it's a translation.
2011-04-28T06:46:41  <mcstar> how would u write what u hear in hungarian
2011-04-28T06:46:41  <Frontier> oh my bad

2011-04-28T06:48:12  <stocha> but it really won't sound close i guess.
2011-04-28T06:48:33  <stocha> i'm not even sure how you pronounce it really.
2011-04-28T06:48:45  <stocha> i'm totally confused with hungarian vovels.
2011-04-28T06:49:47  <mcstar> i cant transcribe it to french
2011-04-28T06:50:05  <stocha> remembering what my wife told me
2011-04-28T06:50:16  <stocha> szep might be : séééép
2011-04-28T06:50:27  <mcstar> sz is like english c
2011-04-28T06:50:38  <stocha> i think she insisted that the length of the vovel was very important.
2011-04-28T06:50:44  <mcstar> yes
2011-04-28T06:51:00  <mcstar> , means long
2011-04-28T06:51:01  <stocha> Néééémèth
2011-04-28T06:51:04  <mcstar> but it makes it sharp too
2011-04-28T06:52:07  <mcstar> can u pronounce Nate in english?
2011-04-28T06:52:17  <stocha> sz like english c : coal ?
2011-04-28T06:52:25  <mcstar> the nick name of Nathaniel
2011-04-28T06:52:32  <stocha> ?
2011-04-28T06:52:48  <stocha> my english pronounciation is known to be lacky :p
2011-04-28T06:52:55  <mcstar> oh
2011-04-28T06:52:58  <stocha> still i don't think sz is like c in english :p

2011-04-28T06:55:26  <mcstar> so there are still words with ß?
2011-04-28T06:55:29  <mcstar> good to know
2011-04-28T06:55:55  <stocha> they should simply all make use of standard english characters. and voilà.

2011-04-28T06:57:01  <Frontier> Spaß = fun is an example of a word still written with ß

2011-04-28T07:08:08  <stocha> mm to bad. Next time i'm in transit in budapest i could have had someone to see at last :p
2011-04-28T07:08:31  <mcstar> maybe when u visit next time i will live there again
2011-04-28T07:08:36  <mcstar> its very probably
2011-04-28T07:08:39  <stocha> maybe i should inquire about go clubs that may be near the airport also.

2011-04-28T07:18:56  <stocha> well, if dead ant would transform into food, you would soon have problem.
2011-04-28T07:20:12  <stocha> it would be faster to simply use a conversion rule. So that "dead" ant are simply turned to their most damager enemy.
2011-04-28T07:20:47  <stocha> maybe that would be interesting. But you would have more ants to care for. because they would never die.

2011-04-28T07:21:30  <mcstar> if(in one battle everyone dies) {leave a food cube}else{pass}
2011-04-28T07:22:48  <mcstar> antimatroid said the maps get filled with food
2011-04-28T07:23:08  <mcstar> thats why i said maybe battle sites should be preferred
2011-04-28T07:23:32  <mcstar> so that :
2011-04-28T07:23:46  <mcstar> u want to approach battle because u want to eat food
2011-04-28T07:23:49  <mcstar> but at the same time
2011-04-28T07:24:05  <mcstar> u dont want to battle if the proportions arent right
2011-04-28T07:24:11  <mcstar> beacuse u wont get food then
2011-04-28T07:24:20  <mcstar> so its kind of self-regulating instability
2011-04-28T07:24:31  <mcstar> but its just an idea
2011-04-28T07:24:54  <mcstar> doesnt worth a dime until a simulation shows it has merit
2011-04-28T07:25:02  <stocha> so you have one ant per side at the start. And then you try to eat them. :p
2011-04-28T07:25:19  <stocha> Most rules are totally arbitrary at this point.
2011-04-28T07:25:30  <stocha> but the flip side won't buy much suffrage i'm affraid :p
2011-04-28T07:25:38  <stocha> be it direct or indirect.
2011-04-28T07:26:40  <stocha> Anyway, everybody keep thinking avoiding fight will be good. But i have seen no evidences of that. I have played i guess about one million games in my mocked ant environment.
2011-04-28T07:27:12  <stocha> I don't want to conclude anything to fast though. because the game seems to be very sensible to parameters.
2011-04-28T07:27:15  <mcstar> well, i say it too, because fight is inevitable
2011-04-28T07:27:28  <mcstar> sooner or later somebody has to be neo against smith
2011-04-28T07:27:41  <mcstar> but until then u have to eat eat
2011-04-28T07:27:43  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-28T07:27:54  <mcstar> a fat neo can beat a skinny smith

2011-04-28T07:28:44  <mcstar> agreed, not a good one
2011-04-28T07:29:06  <antimatroid> "sooner or later somebody has to be neo against smith" :D
2011-04-28T07:29:46  <antimatroid> i really liked the matrix
2011-04-28T07:29:49  <antimatroid> THE
2011-04-28T07:29:50  <antimatroid> just one
2011-04-28T07:29:53  <mcstar> i know, i watch too much matrix
2011-04-28T07:30:31  <stocha> well it's refreshing. thoses metaphores of you. i would just like to picture them more clearly and relate them to their target.
2011-04-28T07:30:52  <stocha> il really liked matrix III.
2011-04-28T07:30:59  <antimatroid> what is that?
2011-04-28T07:31:08  <stocha> with the vampires and such.

2011-04-28T07:31:54  <mcstar> oh antimatroid is a conservative guy
2011-04-28T07:31:59  <stocha> matriz reloaded then.

2011-04-28T07:33:14  <antimatroid> i don't know what it is :P
2011-04-28T07:33:42  <stocha> it was cool. With imortal taking planes with katanas, and going everywhere with them. Kinda like clark kent and his cape.
2011-04-28T07:34:14  <mcstar> i havent decide yet if the highlanders are comedies or is it serious
2011-04-28T07:34:35  <mcstar> i beleive HL3 is the most wtf movie ever
2011-04-28T07:35:12  <mcstar> the one which is in the future
2011-04-28T07:35:15  <mcstar> or something
2011-04-28T07:35:17  <mcstar> i cant remember
2011-04-28T07:35:30  <mcstar> but theres a project regarding the sky
2011-04-28T07:35:35  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-04-28T07:35:51  <mcstar> u must know stocha
2011-04-28T07:36:32  <mcstar> antimatroid: i like all 3 matrix movies
2011-04-28T07:36:40  <antimatroid> what movies?
2011-04-28T07:36:44  <mcstar> i dont think the first is in fact better than the 3rd
2011-04-28T07:36:58  <mcstar> sure :)
2011-04-28T07:37:12  <antimatroid> there is no third
2011-04-28T07:37:32  <stocha> it's highlander II than one mcstar
2011-04-28T07:37:35  <stocha> that
2011-04-28T07:37:40  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-04-28T07:37:55  <stocha> the one with the sky, and very coherent scenario.
2011-04-28T07:38:22  <stocha> where long dead people sundenly come out of the tomb to meet their old friends.
2011-04-28T07:38:38  <mcstar> i know i liked the series with adrian paul
2011-04-28T07:38:48  <stocha> and you such a good explanation for why the immortal fight and where they come from.
2011-04-28T07:38:59  <stocha> The first highlander is cult though.
2011-04-28T07:39:07  <stocha> to match up matrix in fact.
2011-04-28T07:39:15  <stocha> the first one once again.
2011-04-28T07:39:23  <Ice_Harley> What "seed" means? Is was added to ruby starter pack, but I don't see it in specification
2011-04-28T07:39:33  <stocha> seed mean an int
2011-04-28T07:39:39  <stocha> that is used to seed random generator.
2011-04-28T07:39:48  <Ice_Harley> for food?
2011-04-28T07:40:00  <stocha> in theory it could be anything. But ussually it would be an int.
2011-04-28T07:40:15  <stocha> for anything random really.
2011-04-28T07:40:30  <Ice_Harley> it's to be able to reproduce game?
2011-04-28T07:40:30  <stocha> if your bot what to make random choices.
2011-04-28T07:41:01  <stocha> yeah. so that despite it goes random, same seed produce same random sequence.
2011-04-28T07:41:19  <mcstar> watch out for seeding with time later
2011-04-28T07:41:48  <mcstar> (havent seen the code just saying)
2011-04-28T07:42:07  <stocha> i you use C langage you don't need that. Because most c program will have out of bound write instructions wich will produce random behaviors :p

2011-04-28T07:59:11  <mcstar> frontier sent me a bbc nature video link
2011-04-28T07:59:22  <mcstar> and i was browsing around that channel
2011-04-28T08:00:32  <Frontier> well, if you were in the desert with no water you would make camels vomit and dring frog pee ;)
2011-04-28T08:00:52  <mcstar> aaaaaaaa
2011-04-28T08:01:13  <mcstar> maybe i dont come close to the desert

2011-04-28T08:09:09  <stocha> bur seriously you all have noticed that superman as clark ken wore it's superman outfit under his wall-stree suit right ?
2011-04-28T08:09:38  <stocha> But ... the big red cloak. What about it ? Where in hell does he hide it ? it's important guys. Help me.
2011-04-28T08:10:41  <stocha> Well it's true that seeing how the outfit resists bullets it's probably alien cloth. Maybe kryptonian coton is invulnerable as well. And very thin.
2011-04-28T08:10:54  <mcstar> rly? i thought he changed
2011-04-28T08:11:08  <stocha> you never watched superman ?
2011-04-28T08:11:19  <mcstar> well erm ehh
2011-04-28T08:11:20  <kaemo> stocha: maybe he had secret pocket on his back
2011-04-28T08:11:21  <stocha> At least have a look at the show "lois and clark"
2011-04-28T08:11:32  <mcstar> i think i did
2011-04-28T08:11:38  <mcstar> those were movies right
2011-04-28T08:11:39  <kaemo> like bike messabgers
2011-04-28T08:11:40  <mcstar> ?
2011-04-28T08:11:52  <mcstar> he was a little boy i remember
2011-04-28T08:11:57  <stocha> simply google "lois and clark" and look at the pictures.
2011-04-28T08:12:02  <mcstar> and a farmer brought him up
2011-04-28T08:12:17  <Frontier> best trick ever played on people: http://www.swr.de/verstehen-sie-spass/videos/-/id=3606784/did=7893490/pv=video/nid=3606784/of80i0/index.html (one woman says "I'm from another star, obviously" - maybe Krypton)
2011-04-28T08:12:45  <stocha> i don't remember that movie very well, but i still think he would wear the superman outfit beneath the wall street one.
2011-04-28T08:13:06  <mcstar> this lois and clark is too erotic
2011-04-28T08:13:12  <kaemo> stocha: me too
2011-04-28T08:13:14  <stocha> ?
2011-04-28T08:14:49  <mcstar> HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHA
2011-04-28T08:15:10  <stocha> falling from 7th floor ?

2011-04-28T08:15:23  <stocha> don't tell me he posted a deutch video.
2011-04-28T08:15:26  <mcstar> look at the  link sotocha
2011-04-28T08:15:29  <antimatroid> that reminds me of the story of the russian guy who got pissed off at his wife/gf
2011-04-28T08:15:36  <antimatroid> after drinking like 2 bottles of vodka
2011-04-28T08:15:47  <antimatroid> jumped out the window of like a 7? story building
2011-04-28T08:15:49  <stocha> i can hardly put the sound on. i just browsered quickly and steathilly trhough the video
2011-04-28T08:16:02  <antimatroid> came back up not badly hurt, she was calling an ambulance or something
2011-04-28T08:16:06  <antimatroid> he got annoyed so jumped out again
2011-04-28T08:16:20  <Ice_Harley> antimatroid: we, russians, are all like that
2011-04-28T08:16:35  <antimatroid> Ice_Harley: i wouldn't accept evidence to the contrary :)

2011-04-28T08:17:50  <Ice_Harley> for the best girlfriend, maybe )
2011-04-28T08:18:01  <antimatroid> best girlfriend?

2011-04-28T08:18:09  <antimatroid> how many girlfriends does the typical russian have?
2011-04-28T08:18:29  <stocha> he doesn't remember. too much vodka :p
2011-04-28T08:18:33  <Ice_Harley> ukrainian to be exact, but not much difference

2011-04-28T08:19:23  <stocha> it's classical joke. I have seen it on frensh television, some years back.
2011-04-28T08:19:37  <mcstar> u can see they dont movie exactly in synchron
2011-04-28T08:19:44  <mcstar> but its good
2011-04-28T08:19:56  <kaemo> ja
2011-04-28T08:20:34  <Frontier> stocha: I'd love to see the french version, too. everyone reacts differently, hehe
2011-04-28T08:20:47  <kaemo> they don't have to do it exactly synchronised coz ppl are too much ocncerned on themselves
2011-04-28T08:21:37  <antimatroid> FUCK YEAH

2011-04-28T08:21:47  <antimatroid> my favourite show
2011-04-28T08:21:50  <Frontier> i liked the ending where the two other women were like "now look! your mirror image is misbehaving, too! we are not crazy!" and the actress just moves out like it was normal
2011-04-28T08:21:52  <Ice_Harley> stocha: dobriy den, yes ) good day
2011-04-28T08:24:23  <Ice_Harley> interesting, how many people here know russian. In PlanetWars top-ranking were many russian-speaking. I think _iouri_ is from russian family
2011-04-28T08:24:36  <mcstar> im afraid that the above joke will be possible in the future
2011-04-28T08:24:46  <mcstar> laughing man?

2011-04-28T08:25:36  <mcstar> i loved southpark and didnt like simpsons
2011-04-28T08:26:00  <mcstar> but i grew up eventually

2011-04-28T08:30:41  <antimatroid> beaver damn is possibly my favourite episode of south park
2011-04-28T08:30:47  <antimatroid> season 9 was great
2011-04-28T08:31:04  <antimatroid> it probably helped that i saw south park right at the start
2011-04-28T08:31:10  <antimatroid> it hasn't been as great lately though
2011-04-28T08:32:47  <stocha> i tryed a few lesson of russian at some point. but i didn't go further :p
2011-04-28T08:33:14  <stocha> i'm not sure it's really more complicated than hungarian. For simply have enough to be able to follow simple conversation stuff.
2011-04-28T08:33:34  <stocha> i definetly need hungarian first.
2011-04-28T08:34:33  <stocha> Language is a fascinating data structure. i don't understand it.

2011-04-28T08:34:56  <stocha> so twisted. Like a real life animal really.
2011-04-28T08:35:33  <mcstar> i started russian and japanese with Rosetta Stone
2011-04-28T08:36:11  <stocha> i went through the first lessons of japaneese also. that one seems quite easy. (to listen to. Not to read obviously :p )
2011-04-28T08:36:15  <mcstar> i think if someone is serious about learning any of it, u have to get ur hands dirty with real books
2011-04-28T08:36:46  <mcstar> these so called language softwares are woth jackshit
2011-04-28T08:37:29  <stocha> I think having a few work vocabulary is enough with foreign langage. So you can speak simply meaning. And follow simple conversation. it's a lot easier than true language learning.
2011-04-28T08:37:50  <stocha> work= word simply=simple
2011-04-28T08:38:11  <mcstar> now it makes more sense:)
2011-04-28T08:38:21  <stocha> mcstar: you learnt japaneese with books ? :p
2011-04-28T08:38:33  <mcstar> i tried software
2011-04-28T08:38:37  <mcstar> than videos
2011-04-28T08:38:44  <mcstar> then a book
2011-04-28T08:39:01  <mcstar> the videos are easy, and actually theres knowledge in them
2011-04-28T08:39:06  <stocha> written Japanese is like chinese to me.
2011-04-28T08:39:15  <mcstar> but eventually u have to pick up books
2011-04-28T08:39:20  <stocha> what kind of video ?
2011-04-28T08:39:40  <mcstar> well, its easier first u have to use latin phonetic trnscription
2011-04-28T08:39:55  <mcstar> u dont need kanji characters
2011-04-28T08:40:15  <mcstar> and theres hiragana and katakana which is also easier than kanji
2011-04-28T08:40:35  <mcstar> the Althouse series
2011-04-28T08:41:07  <mcstar> an american lady, Something Althouse teaches u jap. in Tokyo
2011-04-28T08:41:09  <stocha> but you won't be able to read a newspaper with those.
2011-04-28T08:41:14  <mcstar> in time
2011-04-28T08:41:17  <mcstar> i mean sur enot

2011-04-28T08:43:39  <mcstar> i transcriebd it in hungarian

2011-04-28T08:43:51  <antimatroid> i struggle with english

2011-04-28T08:44:06  <antimatroid> and that's my only language
2011-04-28T08:44:17  <mcstar> ur mothertongue?

2011-04-28T08:45:51  <mcstar> is it cursing?
2011-04-28T08:46:04  <antimatroid> i've been told it's basically the equivalent of fuck in french
2011-04-28T08:46:05  <stocha> it's quite strong strong. As strong as "fuck".
2011-04-28T08:46:06  <antimatroid> from more than one person
2011-04-28T08:46:12  <stocha> same use i guess.

2011-04-28T08:52:34  <stocha> even when i try hard.
2011-04-28T08:53:22  <stocha> natural langage translation at this point mainly use statisticall rules.
2011-04-28T08:53:58  <stocha> so you use a set of text in one language with the corresponding set of text using correct translation in the other langage
2011-04-28T08:54:20  <mcstar> exactly what google traslate doing
2011-04-28T08:54:22  <stocha> then you apply statisticall learning algorithm. As far as i know it's still what google do. Although they have lot of data
2011-04-28T08:55:21  <mcstar> i wonder how costly this is
2011-04-28T08:55:37  <mcstar> the translation is instant, but google has tremendous processing power
2011-04-28T08:55:51  <mcstar> i wonder if it were this fast on a single core
2011-04-28T08:56:00  <mcstar> if data  IO werent an issue
2011-04-28T08:56:19  <stocha> i don't think the current method is slow. Once the learning is done.
2011-04-28T08:56:28  <stocha> but the result is crappy.
2011-04-28T08:57:06  <mcstar> well, machines dont understand context

2011-04-28T09:00:57  <stocha> so anyone can be proficient at it. If they spend quite some time practicing.
2011-04-28T09:01:04  <mcstar> i have no problem calling it science
2011-04-28T09:01:17  <stocha> science should use scientific methods.
2011-04-28T09:01:32  <mcstar> i dont mean com. science is about writing code
2011-04-28T09:01:38  <stocha> which some "scientist" tend to forget these days also. it seems.
2011-04-28T09:01:48  <mcstar> algorith theory, complexity theory
2011-04-28T09:01:57  <stocha> that's mathematical.
2011-04-28T09:01:58  <mcstar> these stuffs arent easy
2011-04-28T09:02:01  <stocha> wich is not science.
2011-04-28T09:02:07  *** slkjcna <slkjcna!~proton@li189-81.members.linode.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-28T09:02:14  <mcstar> u mean math is not science?
2011-04-28T09:02:18  <stocha> yeah.
2011-04-28T09:02:20  <stocha> exactly :)
2011-04-28T09:02:26  <mcstar> hm
2011-04-28T09:02:37  <mcstar> i thnk i strongly disagree :)
2011-04-28T09:02:51  <stocha> science use math. Math doesn't use antyhing; But mathematician names in order to make stuff impossible to remember and understand.
2011-04-28T09:03:20  <mcstar> math sometimes uses physics, experience
2011-04-28T09:03:32  <mcstar> those ideas arent comeing from NOTHING
2011-04-28T09:03:49  <mcstar> people find them out
2011-04-28T09:03:56  <antimatroid> http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gz7t8/why_was_my_reddit_account_deleted/
2011-04-28T09:03:57  <antimatroid> lol reddit
2011-04-28T09:04:05  <mcstar> and they use theyre own analogues, adn experiences with many things
2011-04-28T09:04:15  <mcstar> adn->and
2011-04-28T09:04:17  <mcstar> not dna
2011-04-28T09:05:09  <stocha> mathematician ?
2011-04-28T09:05:31  <stocha> have you looked at Cantor theory ?
2011-04-28T09:06:01  <mcstar> set theory?
2011-04-28T09:06:05  <stocha> arguably some (great) mathematician of his time state it was just non sense.
2011-04-28T09:06:13  <stocha> yeah i guess it's called set theory
2011-04-28T09:06:19  <stocha> with cantor diagonal proof and such.
2011-04-28T09:06:58  <antimatroid> lol, did you just say set theory is nonsense?
2011-04-28T09:07:04  <stocha> he ended his life into a house for crazy people i believe. But some people still think it's a good theory.
2011-04-28T09:07:18  <stocha> i said that some great mathematician alive when cantor was said that.
2011-04-28T09:07:23  <stocha> but i can say it too.
2011-04-28T09:07:25  <antimatroid> ah yeah :P
2011-04-28T09:07:25  <antimatroid> sorry
2011-04-28T09:07:35  <stocha> watch me : set theory is non sendse.
2011-04-28T09:07:36  <mcstar> well cantor was an idiot
2011-04-28T09:07:48  <mcstar> like boltzmann
2011-04-28T09:08:00  <stocha> he had 50 years advance from his time.
2011-04-28T09:08:03  <mcstar> they couldnt accept that there are stupid people
2011-04-28T09:08:12  <mcstar> and THIS made them stupid too
2011-04-28T09:08:20  <mcstar> but this is totally irrelevant
2011-04-28T09:08:44  <stocha> i'm not sure i'm following you mcstar.
2011-04-28T09:08:54  <stocha> your meaning i mean.
2011-04-28T09:09:11  <mcstar> im just saying that they shouldnt commit suicide
2011-04-28T09:09:19  <stocha> whom ?
2011-04-28T09:09:33  <mcstar> botzmann for example
2011-04-28T09:09:43  <mcstar> and there are other examples
2011-04-28T09:09:57  <mcstar> maybe godel too?
2011-04-28T09:10:02  <mcstar> i cant remember
2011-04-28T09:10:42  <stocha> you mean all the people that used set theory to proove some stuff ?
2011-04-28T09:11:28  <mcstar> gödel starved himself to death
2011-04-28T09:11:42  <mcstar> abel was killed in a foolish duel
2011-04-28T09:12:04  <mcstar> ted kazinchky was the unabomber
2011-04-28T09:12:07  <stocha> i didn't knew that.
2011-04-28T09:12:25  <mcstar> turing
2011-04-28T09:12:29  <mcstar> turing was gay
2011-04-28T09:12:35  <stocha> but that explain how this thing lived up this time. There were lots of crazy people involved :p
2011-04-28T09:12:39  <mcstar> the government treated him with hormones
2011-04-28T09:12:45  <mcstar> he went nuts too
2011-04-28T09:13:27  <mcstar> then he died of cyadine poisoning
2011-04-28T09:13:41  <mcstar> so its all crazy
2011-04-28T09:13:59  <mcstar> there are examples of physicists to besides boltzamnn
2011-04-28T09:14:26  <mcstar> theres majorana who went missing, porbably killed himself too, not sure
2011-04-28T09:15:19  <mcstar> i dont know any more from the top of my head
2011-04-28T09:15:39  <stocha> i learned abel theorem once.
2011-04-28T09:15:48  <stocha> it was like integration.
2011-04-28T09:15:53  <stocha> but with integer.
2011-04-28T09:16:03  <stocha> no set theory involved.
2011-04-28T09:16:18  <mcstar> which is abel's theorem?
2011-04-28T09:16:38  <mcstar> that no closed solution exists to >=5h order polynomials?
2011-04-28T09:16:55  <stocha> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel's_theorem
2011-04-28T09:17:05  <stocha> i don't think no :p
2011-04-28T09:17:13  <stocha> it's releated to series of real number
2011-04-28T09:17:14  <mcstar> oh
2011-04-28T09:17:25  <stocha> with sum of a^n stuff i think.
2011-04-28T09:17:43  <mcstar> i didnt know about this
2011-04-28T09:17:57  <mcstar> i started to read his other proof
2011-04-28T09:18:17  <mcstar> the one with the roots of >5th order integer coeffcient polynomials
2011-04-28T09:18:27  <stocha> it looks more like series of complex number in this article
2011-04-28T09:19:09  <stocha> i didn't really spend much time studying. i only happen to remember this one because of special happening.
2011-04-28T09:24:09  <antimatroid> galois is abel?
2011-04-28T09:24:51  <mcstar> nein
2011-04-28T09:25:06  <mcstar> ah galois did duel right
2011-04-28T09:25:11  <mcstar> and abel died of poor health
2011-04-28T09:25:15  <mcstar> doesnt matter
2011-04-28T09:26:31  <mcstar> im sure if i were that smart i would value my life more
2011-04-28T09:27:51  <mcstar> stocha: this theorem is interesting
2011-04-28T09:28:10  <mcstar> theres some hidden non-triviality in theres
2011-04-28T09:28:11  <mcstar> -s
2011-04-28T09:28:54  <mcstar> but cant be too hard to prove considering that complex continuity is such a bliss
2011-04-28T09:31:44  <stocha> We had an assignment, where 200 person would have to explain what idea the theorem was built on.
2011-04-28T09:32:04  <stocha> the first to submit the right solution would have a bonus to his math notes.
2011-04-28T09:32:07  <stocha> quite a big one.
2011-04-28T09:32:27  <stocha> i was that person :p . I really help, because i ended up with 3.
2011-04-28T09:32:35  <stocha> It really helped.
2011-04-28T09:32:38  <stocha> 3/20

2011-04-28T09:43:49  <mcstar> physics
2011-04-28T09:44:03  <mcstar> but lately im interested in math
2011-04-28T09:47:56  <mcstar> i guess u applied lower and upper bounds by integrals and then took the limit?
2011-04-28T09:48:41  <mcstar> but i think it can be done without resorting to these higher constructs as integrals

2011-04-28T09:54:19  <stocha> I think i simply showed that the demonstration for prooving integral formulae and this one was alike.
2011-04-28T09:55:08  <stocha> With swtiching the integral sign with a Sigma one.
2011-04-28T09:58:22  <stocha> i don't really want to dig to much in those memories. To much stuff is associated in there.
2011-04-28T09:58:39  <mcstar> haha
2011-04-28T09:58:57  <mcstar> u didnt drink enough to make room for new memories then
2011-04-28T10:01:26  <stocha> i never drink alcohol.
2011-04-28T10:02:04  <mcstar> good for you
2011-04-28T10:02:25  <mcstar> but in this i didnt drink yet
2011-04-28T10:02:32  <mcstar> this year
2011-04-28T10:02:40  <stocha> i have this problem with some memories that are distributed randomly through time. And they all awfully seems like yesterday. That causes lots of problem. Nostalgia being one of them.
2011-04-28T10:03:16  <mcstar> i cant imagine that
2011-04-28T10:03:31  <stocha> There are all sort of stuff into this. But imagine anystrong feeling that took years to overcome. And sundenly it's yestarday.
2011-04-28T10:03:33  <mcstar> i usually dont remember what happened in the past
2011-04-28T10:04:05  <mcstar> i mean i know i grew up somehow, but i cant recall all the details
2011-04-28T10:04:09  <stocha> People that i was closely related to sudenly don't remember me. Etc :p
2011-04-28T10:04:23  <mcstar> o
2011-04-28T10:04:24  <mcstar> h
2011-04-28T10:04:27  <mcstar> weird
2011-04-28T10:04:36  <stocha> that's because 20 years have passed.
2011-04-28T10:04:53  <stocha> but for me the feeling are as strong as if it was simply yesterday.
2011-04-28T10:04:58  <stocha> although i had forgot for like 10 years.
2011-04-28T10:05:23  <stocha> they would sundenly bloom out to life again. Only to find out the world has changed.
2011-04-28T10:07:00  <stocha> that makes the world of relationship a strange place indeed.
2011-04-28T10:10:02  <mcstar> well
2011-04-28T10:10:20  <mcstar> i think it can be proven by considering the reverse triangle and triangle inequality
2011-04-28T10:11:32  <mcstar> but maybe a stronger version is required because of the infinite sum
2011-04-28T10:11:55  <mcstar> the resulting series might not be convergent
2011-04-28T10:11:58  <mcstar> hm

2011-04-28T10:18:10  <stocha> i have made some bot already. In my won ant framework. And i released a java bot in the official framework that is freely available for testing purposes.
2011-04-28T10:18:30  <stocha> although it seems that some people had it taking more than 1s on some 32 bit systems.
2011-04-28T10:18:59  <stocha> But for now, i think i'll just wait to see where the ruleset is going.
2011-04-28T10:19:34  <mcstar> i will use common lisp
2011-04-28T10:19:42  <stocha> i'll have a look at the topology if real challenge game, and see where to put my energy. If i have time enougth in the first place.
2011-04-28T10:20:13  <stocha> becarefull. Time management will play a big role. You could end up with thousands of ants. Depending on the final topology.
2011-04-28T10:20:24  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-28T10:20:28  <mcstar> im not there yet
2011-04-28T10:20:41  <mcstar> i first have to learn the language
2011-04-28T10:20:44  <stocha> i think it's okay to try a bit, and see how the game feel though :p
2011-04-28T10:20:56  <stocha> you have to learn lisp ?
2011-04-28T10:20:59  <aerique_> mcstar: better get started then!
2011-04-28T10:21:08  <mcstar> i already did
2011-04-28T10:21:13  <aerique_> mcstar: http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/
2011-04-28T10:21:18  <aerique_> mcstar: ah good
2011-04-28T10:21:22  <mcstar> for a couple of weeks im learning lisp
2011-04-28T10:21:30  <mcstar> i saw that one
2011-04-28T10:21:34  <aerique_> there's also #lisp on freenode
2011-04-28T10:21:41  <stocha> okay so you want to build a bot to improve your lisp then. why not.
2011-04-28T10:21:48  <mcstar> im reading paul grahams On Lisp
2011-04-28T10:22:07  <aerique_> awesome
2011-04-28T10:22:22  <mcstar> in 2004 i met lisp
2011-04-28T10:22:28  <mcstar> as far as i can remember
2011-04-28T10:22:34  <mcstar> i though it was cool
2011-04-28T10:22:41  <mcstar> but i abandoned it
2011-04-28T10:22:46  <mcstar> cause i had no use for it then
2011-04-28T10:22:55  <mcstar> first of all i was a ohysics student
2011-04-28T10:23:21  <mcstar> but nowadays im interested in computation and algorithms
2011-04-28T10:23:40  <mcstar> and i found lisp to be the language to learn
2011-04-28T10:24:10  <mcstar> i had projects in c,c++, python
2011-04-28T10:24:23  <mcstar> im not expert but im familiar with those
2011-04-28T10:24:33  <mcstar> the other alternative was haskell
2011-04-28T10:24:45  <stocha> 23. Practical: A Spam Filter. interesting
2011-04-28T10:25:21  <stocha> i wonder if lisp is really the thing for the ant game though.
2011-04-28T10:25:29  <mcstar> oh sure :)
2011-04-28T10:25:38  <stocha> where are there list in there :p
2011-04-28T10:25:46  <stocha> i don't use list in my current framework.
2011-04-28T10:25:57  <mcstar> u dont have to use lists
2011-04-28T10:26:04  <mcstar> there are vetors, objects
2011-04-28T10:26:07  <mcstar> anything really
2011-04-28T10:26:18  <mcstar> the code itself is a LIST
2011-04-28T10:26:20  <mcstar> hence the name
2011-04-28T10:26:25  <aerique_> stocha: he's not using LISP 1.5 from 1959 :-)  there's more data structures nowadays
2011-04-28T10:26:26  <stocha> i though lisp was good at processing lists.
2011-04-28T10:26:36  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-28T10:26:40  <mcstar> its the name
2011-04-28T10:26:48  <stocha> and probably maps.
2011-04-28T10:27:06  <mcstar> u dont have to be fully functional if you dont want to be
2011-04-28T10:27:11  <stocha> but i have no lists nor maps in my current framework. Although arguably the current framework is not meant to build really strong bots.
2011-04-28T10:27:16  <mcstar> thats the problem with haskell
2011-04-28T10:27:29  <mcstar> i couldnt get my head around to think fullly functional
2011-04-28T10:27:31  <stocha> i only use bitoperations and rotations so far.
2011-04-28T10:27:43  <stocha> wich lisp will hardly be good for.
2011-04-28T10:28:00  <stocha> even if i could speak lispian in the first place.
2011-04-28T10:28:38  <stocha> I like the functionnal thinking. I don't like the functional languages.
2011-04-28T10:28:52  <mcstar> o.O
2011-04-28T10:29:00  <mcstar> hows that?
2011-04-28T10:29:18  <stocha> maybe functional language are just macroassembler in the end. and bad one at that :p
2011-04-28T10:29:36  <mcstar> let me paste u a little code
2011-04-28T10:29:41  <mcstar> i just have to find it
2011-04-28T10:29:47  <stocha> okay
2011-04-28T10:29:54  <stocha> it can't hurt me i guess :p

2011-04-28T10:31:26  <mcstar> it hurt a little when i saw this the first time, its soo beautiful
2011-04-28T10:32:21  <Frontier> it is lazy evaluated stuff, right?
2011-04-28T10:32:26  <mcstar> aha
2011-04-28T10:32:29  <mcstar> at its best :)
2011-04-28T10:32:47  <mcstar> u have to say
2011-04-28T10:32:52  <mcstar> take 20 fibs
2011-04-28T10:32:55  <mcstar> for example
2011-04-28T10:33:23  <stocha> what's zipWith ?
2011-04-28T10:33:36  *** aerique_ <aerique_!310225@xs3.xs4all.nl> has quit IRC (Quit: ...)
2011-04-28T10:33:54  <mcstar> well applies the + function to the elements of its two lists in pairs
2011-04-28T10:34:42  <mcstar> u see, + is a function, it has to be paranthesized
2011-04-28T10:35:01  <stocha> how does it do time wise ?
2011-04-28T10:35:08  <mcstar> O(n)
2011-04-28T10:35:09  *** aerique <aerique!310225@xs3.xs4all.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-28T10:35:22  <mcstar> not like plain recursion
2011-04-28T10:35:50  <stocha> i'm not sure i really understand what's going on in there then :p
2011-04-28T10:36:30  <mcstar> : is concatenation
2011-04-28T10:36:30  <stocha> would you write a simple factorial to begin with ? :p
2011-04-28T10:36:42  <mcstar> el1 : list
2011-04-28T10:36:46  *** aerique <aerique!310225@xs3.xs4all.nl> has quit IRC (Client Quit)
2011-04-28T10:36:57  <mcstar> so fibs is a variable
2011-04-28T10:37:10  <mcstar> which is of type integer list
2011-04-28T10:37:16  *** woudshoo <woudshoo!~user@ipleiden.intellimagic.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-28T10:37:19  <mcstar> the first element 0
2011-04-28T10:37:23  <mcstar> second 1
2011-04-28T10:37:35  <mcstar> and rest is given as an instruction
2011-04-28T10:37:45  <stocha> i figured this much 0:1:
2011-04-28T10:37:55  <stocha> then i don't know what's going on.
2011-04-28T10:37:55  <mcstar> if you have the fibonacci sequence
2011-04-28T10:38:04  <mcstar> the removing its frst element
2011-04-28T10:38:12  <mcstar> than adding to it the sequence again
2011-04-28T10:38:16  <mcstar> is equals
2011-04-28T10:38:25  <mcstar> the remaining list after 0,1
2011-04-28T10:38:36  <mcstar> its a property of the fibonacci sequence
2011-04-28T10:38:51  <mcstar> it is just simply written out in haskell
2011-04-28T10:38:59  <mcstar> and because of the lazy evaluation
2011-04-28T10:39:05  <mcstar> u wont get an infinite list
2011-04-28T10:39:15  <stocha> what is fibonaci ?   An= An-1+An-2 ?
2011-04-28T10:39:16  <mcstar> of course if u were to print fibs
2011-04-28T10:39:21  <mcstar> then it wont stop :)
2011-04-28T10:39:27  <mcstar> yes
2011-04-28T10:39:39  <mcstar> f(n-1)+f(n-2)=f(n)
2011-04-28T10:40:31  <stocha> i still don't understand the syntax. nor what the fib variable is useful for.
2011-04-28T10:40:43  <stocha> fibs
2011-04-28T10:40:44  <mcstar> the fibs contains the list
2011-04-28T10:40:53  <stocha> fibs is an infinite list then.
2011-04-28T10:40:56  <stocha> so.
2011-04-28T10:40:57  <mcstar> yes
2011-04-28T10:41:05  <mcstar> but it doesnt get evaluated
2011-04-28T10:41:10  <stocha> i don't see what the list looks like by looking at the code.
2011-04-28T10:41:22  <stocha> and don't know how to use the lists itself
2011-04-28T10:41:26  <mcstar> it is exactly like the mathematical definition
2011-04-28T10:41:50  <stocha> i understand you f(n-1) notation better :p
2011-04-28T10:42:39  <mcstar> fibs=0,1,1,2,3,5,8
2011-04-28T10:42:44  <mcstar> its part of fibs
2011-04-28T10:42:51  <mcstar> tail fibs
2011-04-28T10:42:56  <mcstar> 1,1,2,3,5,8
2011-04-28T10:43:09  <mcstar> fibs+tail(fibs)
2011-04-28T10:43:16  <mcstar> 1,3,5,8...
2011-04-28T10:43:29  <mcstar> 0:1:1,3,5,8
2011-04-28T10:43:40  <mcstar> 0,1,1,3,3,5,8
2011-04-28T10:43:46  <mcstar> sorry 2 is left out :)
2011-04-28T10:43:53  <mcstar> but i think u get my point
2011-04-28T10:44:05  <mcstar> just imagine the fib, sequence laid out
2011-04-28T10:44:15  <mcstar> cut off the first element
2011-04-28T10:44:22  <mcstar> add to fibs again
2011-04-28T10:44:24  <stocha> + is list concatenation ?
2011-04-28T10:44:26  <mcstar> element-wise
2011-04-28T10:44:27  <bhasker> antimatroid around?
2011-04-28T10:44:34  <mcstar> no
2011-04-28T10:44:43  <mcstar> zipwith is like:
2011-04-28T10:45:00  <mcstar> (1 2 3)+(4 5 6)=(5,7,9)
2011-04-28T10:45:11  <stocha> mmm
2011-04-28T10:45:19  <mcstar> ok?
2011-04-28T10:45:33  <mcstar> it just adds up two lists elemnt-wise
2011-04-28T10:45:38  <mcstar> : is concatenation
2011-04-28T10:45:48  <mcstar> 1:(2 3)=(1 2 3)
2011-04-28T10:46:18  <mcstar> but in haskell u have to use ,
2011-04-28T10:46:18  <bhasker> i was wondering any reason why the engine doesn't keep ant_ids for each ant
2011-04-28T10:46:32  <bhasker> would make it a lot easier in the starter bots to keep persistent objects for each ant
2011-04-28T10:46:34  <Frontier> hihi
2011-04-28T10:47:00  <bhasker> instead of having to do a hacky job of iterating list of ants to find same ants and tracking whch ones died and which ones moved etc etc
2011-04-28T10:47:38  <bhasker> like if i wanted to track a per ant tracking data its pretty painful to do right now
2011-04-28T10:48:02  <Frontier> I had a long argument over that when writing the visualizer. I finally got my ant ids :-)
2011-04-28T10:48:05  <stocha> my wife is at budapest right now. she will take a plane soon.
2011-04-28T10:48:12  <bhasker> you did?
2011-04-28T10:48:36  <mcstar> u want me to wave for her?
2011-04-28T10:48:45  <Frontier> i did get ant ids, now it is even a different matter since i get just one text line per ant.
2011-04-28T10:48:59  <Frontier> obviously i can assign a number to each line there
2011-04-28T10:49:07  <bhasker> but that is not required to be consistent
2011-04-28T10:49:08  <stocha> she would be in the airport i guess.
2011-04-28T10:49:11  <bhasker> across turns
2011-04-28T10:49:31  <Frontier> there are no separate turns in the replay data i process
2011-04-28T10:49:43  <bhasker> ah
2011-04-28T10:50:03  <stocha> the engine track every ant and assign them ids ?
2011-04-28T10:50:12  <bhasker> yes
2011-04-28T10:50:19  <stocha> then why not send that.
2011-04-28T10:50:22  <stocha> to the bots.
2011-04-28T10:50:26  <bhasker> oh it doesn't do it today
2011-04-28T10:50:29  <stocha> i mean it would break everything i guess.
2011-04-28T10:50:30  <bhasker> but it should be a trivial thing
2011-04-28T10:50:31  <bhasker> to add
2011-04-28T10:50:53  <Frontier> ids may give away information about the other players
2011-04-28T10:50:57  <bhasker> doesn't have to
2011-04-28T10:50:59  <stocha> ah the engine don't track each ant at the moment then. how does it build the output file then ?
2011-04-28T10:51:04  <bhasker> can be a random id
2011-04-28T10:51:07  <bhasker> as long as its consistent
2011-04-28T10:51:08  <bhasker> doe
2011-04-28T10:51:18  <Frontier> oh well, ask sigh about it :)
2011-04-28T10:51:25  <stocha> i can also be ids local for players.
2011-04-28T10:51:27  <bhasker> it probably just tracks them as a list
2011-04-28T10:51:37  <stocha> like they do with player id in fact.
2011-04-28T10:51:41  <bhasker> haven't looked at the code
2011-04-28T10:51:47  <Frontier> a protocol change would be considered bad now
2011-04-28T10:52:16  <stocha> the spec is suppose to be fully open. i have heard.
2011-04-28T10:52:27  <stocha> until beta.
2011-04-28T10:52:45  <stocha> although i doubt people will accept that in the facts. if it means breaking everything :p
2011-04-28T10:52:54  <Frontier> ok, but all starter bots need to be adapted to it, including mine :(
2011-04-28T10:53:05  <stocha> It's not the first time that i see someone asking for ant ids.
2011-04-28T10:53:18  <Frontier> that's true
2011-04-28T10:53:18  <bhasker> its just the ant parsing
2011-04-28T10:53:21  <bhasker> line
2011-04-28T10:53:26  <bhasker> bots can just ignore the id for now
2011-04-28T10:53:40  <bhasker> and let the end user modify it and read it if they need to
2011-04-28T10:53:45  <stocha> yeah but you have to close starter bot dev at some point.
2011-04-28T10:53:55  <stocha> some people that wrote them might not be here.
2011-04-28T10:54:05  <bhasker> oh well
2011-04-28T10:54:18  <stocha> like the klingon bot. they guy left last week. So he won't be able to update it.
2011-04-28T10:54:26  <Frontier> agreed. they may not be here often or on holiday or whatever.
2011-04-28T10:55:05  <stocha> In my experience changing spec, is hard to track for people.
2011-04-28T10:55:38  <stocha> you would have some assuming nothing changed. when indeed it has changed. Mixing all features.
2011-04-28T10:55:40  <Frontier> the core developers are more likely to fix their code for late changes (i.e. replay format, database, ...)
2011-04-28T10:56:02  <bhasker> oh well, just a thought, i guess i will write something up client side for myself
2011-04-28T10:56:19  <stocha> the problem is, a lot of people might write it.
2011-04-28T10:56:22  <Frontier> :-) what do you plan to do?
2011-04-28T10:56:25  <stocha> i probably have to it too.
2011-04-28T10:56:43  <stocha> although arguably i wouldn't benefit form the ant id sent by the server.
2011-04-28T10:57:24  <stocha> i still need the tracking code.
2011-04-28T10:58:28  <bhasker> well mostly i will track 2 things per ant
2011-04-28T10:58:30  <bhasker> last location
2011-04-28T10:58:31  <bhasker> and last order
2011-04-28T10:58:39  <bhasker> rather new location
2011-04-28T10:58:51  <bhasker> and just match the new ant locations
2011-04-28T10:59:00  <bhasker> if the location i computed exists in new ant list
2011-04-28T10:59:01  <bhasker> keep it
2011-04-28T10:59:06  <bhasker> otherwise destroy the object
2011-04-28T10:59:27  <bhasker> for any locations not in the ant list create new ant objects
2011-04-28T10:59:49  <bhasker> so won't really have an id but will consistent objects that i update every turn
2011-04-28T11:01:37  <Frontier> I will write an ant that moves a frontier across the map. Maybe that will make sure there are always enough ants at any front location to fend off enemies.
2011-04-28T11:02:34  <Frontier> nah, bad idea. need to expand faster than that. but still I may assign somewhat complex tasks to idividual ants.
2011-04-28T11:03:04  <mcstar> you mean The Final Frontier?
2011-04-28T11:03:07  <bhasker> i am trying out a potential field based navigation
2011-04-28T11:03:16  <bhasker> and for that its easier if i can track per ant previous locations
2011-04-28T11:03:20  <bhasker> upto a certain number of turns
2011-04-28T11:03:24  <bhasker> so that it doesn't get stuck
2011-04-28T11:03:52  <bhasker> in a local maxima or a pair of local maxima's
2011-04-28T11:04:06  <Frontier> bhasker: That sounds good. I'll use it as well, but I'm not sure about how I will handle the water fields. My field may be suboptimal in many cases.
2011-04-28T11:04:32  <bhasker> i am just trying it out, as of now a simple bfs searching based bot
2011-04-28T11:04:40  <bhasker> beats it
2011-04-28T11:04:48  <Frontier> And in case I have too few ants, I want to visit squares again, that were out of view for a long time
2011-04-28T11:04:53  <bhasker> yup
2011-04-28T11:05:27  <stocha> Frontier: i though you had no time to build a ant bot ? :p
2011-04-28T11:05:46  <Frontier> Don't remind me of that.
2011-04-28T11:06:58  <stocha> did you closed your visualizer yet ?
2011-04-28T11:08:17  <Frontier> that's a good question. i'm a bit lazy atm. it seems to work ok, but I know some things are missing (speed adjustment, cpu usage setting, attack radius, graphics version)
2011-04-28T11:11:53  <stocha> simply close it, and say another guy will have to implement the rest.
2011-04-28T11:12:02  <stocha> as long as it is known.
2011-04-28T11:12:30  <stocha> that's the principle of open software i guess. you can close up a project and hope for someone else to take it.
2011-04-28T11:12:50  <stocha> wich tend to never happen in real life of course. but there it could. Because the visualizer will be used.

2011-04-28T11:18:32  <mcstar> what is visualize_locally.py supposed to do?
2011-04-28T11:19:06  <Frontier> I think it is supposed to write a html file that embeds a replay file
2011-04-28T11:19:13  <Frontier> so you can load it up in a browser
2011-04-28T11:19:38  <mcstar> i started it and it didnt close
2011-04-28T11:19:48  <Frontier> you can also use visualizer.jar to load a local file through the command-line
2011-04-28T11:20:12  <mcstar> java -jar visualizer.jar ?
2011-04-28T11:20:13  <Frontier> I'm not sure, maybe something broke it. I think either sigh or McLeopold wrote it.
2011-04-28T11:20:25  <Frontier> java -jar visualizer.jar <file name or url>
2011-04-28T11:21:29  <mcstar> whats the difference between .java and .jar?
2011-04-28T11:21:45  <Frontier> oh first of all .java is source code
2011-04-28T11:21:55  <Frontier> it is compiled to one or more .class files
2011-04-28T11:22:14  <Frontier> .jar is basically a zip file from several .class files and resources like images
2011-04-28T11:22:39  <mcstar> can .java run directly?
2011-04-28T11:22:43  <Frontier> no
2011-04-28T11:23:07  <Frontier> java is not an interpreded language
2011-04-28T11:23:19  <mcstar> oh
2011-04-28T11:23:31  <mcstar> i always thought u can type java in jvm :)
2011-04-28T11:24:38  <Frontier> it is compiled to platform independent "byte code", the class files. there is also the option to compile java source right from within java. but some jvms may have difficulty garbage collecting the new classes and if you use it too much you run out of memory
2011-04-28T11:25:21  <Frontier> python and javascript can be interpreted
2011-04-28T11:25:54  <mcstar> can u package it to be a binary?
2011-04-28T11:26:16  <mcstar> i guess the whole jvm i required
2011-04-28T11:26:20  <mcstar> stupid question
2011-04-28T11:26:26  <mcstar> thats the point in java
2011-04-28T11:26:38  <Frontier> I know that the game minecraft uses a wrapper to make it an .exe, but it will just ask you to install a jvm :)
2011-04-28T11:27:36  <mcstar> i only recently got to know that javascript and java are two different things
2011-04-28T11:27:50  <mcstar> i thought javascript is a simpler java in browsers
2011-04-28T11:27:52  <mcstar> :)

2011-04-28T11:28:50  <Frontier> actually the visualizer.jar includes a JavaScript engine for Java and runs the same code as the web visualizer.

2011-04-28T13:35:20  <bhasker> how is it that i have 2x the number of ants

2011-04-28T13:38:18  <stocha> some true wrapper exists for java.
2011-04-28T13:38:35  <stocha> it build an .exe that can be executed autonomously
2011-04-28T13:38:48  <a1k0n> when does this contest actually officially start?
2011-04-28T13:38:52  <stocha> i guess most would not be free though.
2011-04-28T13:39:05  <stocha> alkOn: at the end of the beta
2011-04-28T13:39:22  <a1k0n> that's sort of self-evident
2011-04-28T13:39:26  <a1k0n> when is that?
2011-04-28T13:39:34  <stocha> later than that i hope.
2011-04-28T13:39:48  <stocha> because they said the beta would go for like two weeks.
2011-04-28T13:40:00  <stocha> wich is hardly enough to do any testing.
2011-04-28T13:40:29  <stocha> anyway, i hope than soon after the beta start, the rules will be hardened enough that anyone can feel free to start real work.
2011-04-28T13:41:34  <bhasker> stocha how is the scoring done

2011-04-28T13:44:06  <stocha_> hopefully the wiki would be up to date on scoring.
2011-04-28T13:44:16  <stocha_> i can tell you what i remember to have heard
2011-04-28T13:44:26  <stocha_> you get point for every spawned ant
2011-04-28T13:44:39  <stocha_> and you get point for every ant your damage and that die
2011-04-28T13:44:50  <stocha_> you damage
2011-04-28T13:45:07  <bhasker> okay then how is it that i have 400 ants
2011-04-28T13:45:10  <bhasker> and the enemy has 90
2011-04-28T13:45:13  <bhasker> but i have a lower score:-\
2011-04-28T13:45:16  <stocha_> then you get some bonus point if you are last standing
2011-04-28T13:45:32  <bhasker> i have 227 and enemy has 234
2011-04-28T13:45:33  <bhasker> :-\
2011-04-28T13:45:39  <stocha_> the new scoring system may not be on yet

2011-04-28T15:49:04  <bhasker> first bot is my new potential field based bot, which uses a combination of bfs search for hunting ants/food and potential fields for movement
2011-04-28T15:49:14  <bhasker> to new areas etc
2011-04-28T15:49:33  <bhasker> the other 3 are simple bfs searcher bots

2011-04-28T15:51:54  <bhasker> my bot does a stupid thing
2011-04-28T15:52:03  <bhasker> it just checks if making that move will prove disastrous
2011-04-28T15:52:11  <bhasker> and if so it moves to the closest friendly ant
2011-04-28T15:52:16  <bhasker> in a direction which is different
2011-04-28T15:52:20  <bhasker> from the original move
2011-04-28T15:52:26  <bhasker> if not it just stays there
2011-04-28T15:52:57  <bhasker> my main logic is something like this
2011-04-28T15:53:14  <bhasker>     //picks out moves for each ant
2011-04-28T15:53:15  <bhasker>     for(int ant=0; ant<(int)state.ants.size(); ant++)

2011-04-28T15:53:16  <bhasker>     }
2011-04-28T15:53:32  <bhasker> find food if nearby food, otherwise go after enemy ant if nearby or just move based on potential

2011-04-28T19:27:14  <jaycobcoleman> bhasker: you should use the food function whenever you do something that isn't altering the food_list :P
2011-04-28T19:27:43  <jaycobcoleman> I'm referring to the closest_food function for greedybot
2011-04-28T19:29:32  <jaycobcoleman> I haven't really tested it, but as of now GreedyBot should be broken because food_list is now a dict
2011-04-28T19:32:36  <jaycobcoleman> But I changed closest_food to use the food_visible function, which returns the exact same input it was getting from food_list in the past, soooo it should work fine as soon as the UNSEEN_FOOD changes are pulled
2011-04-28T19:34:07  <jaycobcoleman> amstan: I forgot to tell you before, but I did make a dirt-ish background a few days ago if you'd like to experiment with it
2011-04-28T19:34:09  <jaycobcoleman> http://i.imgur.com/rAVZq.png
2011-04-28T19:34:20  <jaycobcoleman> It tiles perfectly
2011-04-28T19:34:38  <jaycobcoleman> I won't be too beat up if you don't want to use it though :P
2011-04-28T19:34:57  <jaycobcoleman> Took about 3 minutes
2011-04-28T19:35:23  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: i would use it, but i want to keep that darkening gradient too, so i'll have to use multiple backgrounds for that
2011-04-28T19:36:05  <jaycobcoleman> You're saying you're going to layer it with a darkening gradient?
2011-04-28T19:36:12  <amstan> es

2011-04-28T22:11:03  <bhasker> ah i haven't been really maintaining greedybot, i wrote it but then switched to c++
2011-04-28T22:11:17  <bhasker> i decided i really wanted the speed and control that c++ offers this time around
2011-04-28T22:11:55  <bhasker> python gave me a lot of trouble last time around
2011-04-28T22:16:47  <jaycobcoleman> bhasker: Alright, well I can deal with any other changes that come about that cause problems, but honestly I don't think there'll be anything else. It was really just because you use food_list as opposed to the function that returned food
2011-04-28T22:17:02  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-28T22:17:21  <bhasker> its a rather stupid bot though overall, just wanted to demonstrate some logging ability and a little more complex bot
2011-04-28T22:17:23  <bhasker> than hunter
2011-04-28T22:17:41  <bhasker> i reused my logging framework code from previous contest
2011-04-28T22:18:46  <jaycobcoleman> I'm actually very glad you made it. It'll be a very good example for helping people understand the structure of a slightly more complex bot

2011-04-28T23:02:06  <jaycobcoleman> Do we have an idea as to the number of games we're gonna run per bot?
2011-04-28T23:03:11  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: depends on the number of servers we have
2011-04-28T23:06:24  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@199.36.244.11> has left #aichallenge
2011-04-28T23:10:32  <jaycobcoleman> It'd be nice if we could run at least 10. Obviously servers could put a strain on that :/ but I think that'll be about what's necessary to get an accurate ranking
2011-04-28T23:10:54  <jaycobcoleman> especially if we want people to learn and make changes as they go
2011-04-28T23:10:59  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: have you participated in pw?
2011-04-28T23:11:11  <jaycobcoleman> no I have not
2011-04-28T23:11:21  <jaycobcoleman> It uses ELO doesn't it?
2011-04-28T23:11:29  <amstan> yes, but same concept applies
2011-04-28T23:11:45  <amstan> games run as long as there's servers
2011-04-28T23:11:51  <amstan> i don't think they stop playing
2011-04-28T23:12:02  <amstan> so.. games per bot always increases
2011-04-28T23:12:08  <amstan> the problem is how fast
2011-04-28T23:12:12  <jaycobcoleman> Oh, perfect :P
2011-04-28T23:12:57  <jaycobcoleman> So do we have anything so far as far as trueskill goes?
2011-04-28T23:13:45  <amstan> i have no idea
2011-04-28T23:13:47  <amstan> ask mcleopold
2011-04-28T23:13:52  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-28T23:14:04  <antimatroid> dmj111 did some stuff on it
2011-04-28T23:14:21  <amstan> antimatroid: also.. do you mean why mcleopold meant with that submission dir?
