2011-11-01T00:10:05  <avdg> meh, I am still thinking how I decompose the map
2011-11-01T00:10:22  <avdg> I can't put my ideas in algorithms
2011-11-01T00:10:47  <bmh> avdg: My plan was to just lay down the biggest rectangle I could fit and repeat until it's covered
2011-11-01T00:10:58  <bmh> Then merge the rectangles as long as it improves my objective function
2011-11-01T00:11:13  <roflmao> so you calculate all paths bfs in a rectangle
2011-11-01T00:11:16  <roflmao> then stich them together
2011-11-01T00:11:22  <roflmao> not bad, not bad.
2011-11-01T00:11:22  <bmh> exactly
2011-11-01T00:11:24  <roflmao> i like it
2011-11-01T00:11:25  <avdg> hmm, thats kinda good explanation
2011-11-01T00:11:31  <bmh> me too :)
2011-11-01T00:11:38  <avdg> I forgot the check part...
2011-11-01T00:12:00  <bmh> avdg: any thoughts on rectangle dropping?
2011-11-01T00:12:02  * avdg likes trial and error
2011-11-01T00:12:12  <avdg> bfs?
2011-11-01T00:12:16  <bmh> I remember failing a CS exam sophomore year in college to a problem like this.
2011-11-01T00:12:30  <avdg> just get the surrounding water tiles
2011-11-01T00:12:32  <bmh> drop some points at random and BFS from them?
2011-11-01T00:13:00  <bmh> I think the target number of blocks is probably sqrt(map size)
2011-11-01T00:13:07  <avdg> if you get the 4 closest water tiles (in each wind direction) you get your block
2011-11-01T00:13:28  <avdg> and the check would be that the shape is a circle/oval/rectangle
2011-11-01T00:13:38  <a1k0n> well, trivially in the maze maps you'll get rectangles for the passages, plus all the little one-square side passages
2011-11-01T00:13:54  <bmh> hiya a1k0n :) can you make it for lunch?
2011-11-01T00:13:57  <a1k0n> it's of course NP-complete to find an optimal set, and there are mutliple overlapping solutions
2011-11-01T00:14:12  <avdg> yeah, but its maybe better to ignore these tiny blocks in the representation
2011-11-01T00:14:12  <bmh> Good thing we don't need an optimal set
2011-11-01T00:14:43  <a1k0n> bmh: i don't think i can make it.  my wife has a dentist appt, gotta watch the kids
2011-11-01T00:15:14  <avdg> who cares about visiting 1x1 (but who cares about passing it, like for food)
2011-11-01T00:15:15  <a1k0n> but yeah, greedy search is what i'd do
2011-11-01T00:15:39  <a1k0n> i'm skeptical that it helps very much but maybe it could
2011-11-01T00:15:52  <avdg> but there would still be a problem, there are multiple solutions

2011-11-01T00:17:08  <avdg> solution 1: 1 long rectangle with little rectangles on its side
2011-11-01T00:17:37  <roflmao> @bmh: would you do the stiching across multiple turns?

2011-11-01T00:17:51  <avdg> solution 2: passing many rectangles while passing the long side
2011-11-01T00:18:00  <avdg> that should be fine roflmao
2011-11-01T00:18:04  <bmh> roflmao: how do you mean?
2011-11-01T00:18:10  <bmh> it should be cheap enough to recompute whenever you want it
2011-11-01T00:18:24  <roflmao> oh so you'd compute rectangles that you had ants in?
2011-11-01T00:18:27  <roflmao> then cache them
2011-11-01T00:18:30  <roflmao> and recompute if necessary
2011-11-01T00:18:36  <bmh> I'd compute the whole darn map.
2011-11-01T00:18:41  <avdg> or we can compute rectangles and try to fit squares
2011-11-01T00:18:49  <roflmao> it wouldn't be too slow?

2011-11-01T00:27:34  <avdg> meh, still complex
2011-11-01T00:27:56  <roflmao> just to totally clarify:
2011-11-01T00:28:06  <roflmao> BFS is just like a* just without any queue sorting or heuristic estimating
2011-11-01T00:28:09  <bmh> prove it

2011-11-01T00:29:17  <a1k0n> oh nice, one of the guys in my group has a bot
2011-11-01T00:29:21  <grom358> no BFS is not like A* .. cause A* doesn't travel in all directions
2011-11-01T00:29:23  <a1k0n> yeah.  technically that's dijkstra's.
2011-11-01T00:29:35  <a1k0n> but since all edges have unit cost, you don't need a priority queue
2011-11-01T00:29:46  <roflmao> yeah thats what I'm saying
2011-11-01T00:29:50  <roflmao> no heuristics
2011-11-01T00:29:52  <roflmao> no priority queue
2011-11-01T00:30:01  <roflmao> 0 sorting or prioritizing of any sort
2011-11-01T00:30:02  <roflmao> = bfs
2011-11-01T00:30:04  <a1k0n> right.  you just get a distance to all squares on the map from your starting point.
2011-11-01T00:30:14  <a1k0n> and it visits each square on the map once.
2011-11-01T00:30:18  <bmh> I would write this in C++ given a sufficiently good starter

2011-11-01T00:43:11  <ChrisH_> on the other hand, bots with a skill in a range with a lot of deactivated submissions will not get many games no matter how good or bad they are
2011-11-01T00:43:31  <ChrisH_> basically they suffer because their peers aren't pulling them into games
2011-11-01T00:44:11  <janzert> they shouldn't get many less games than any other activated submission they'll just be a seed a lot more frequently
2011-11-01T00:44:47  <ChrisH_> and that's what is happening in the top portion of the standings at the moment.  I don't know if that will continue after everyone catches on to the system or not, but it will be interesting to see how it evolves

2011-11-01T00:46:39  <ChrisH_> janzert: I'm not sure I'm 100% with you, but I could be pursuaded.
2011-11-01T00:47:17  <janzert> remember whenever you play a game whether you were the seed or pulled into the game you get bumped back to the end of the line for seeding
2011-11-01T00:47:21  <a1k0n> is anyone else playing on ants.fluxid.pl?  it's not.. going
2011-11-01T00:48:28  <janzert> so the areas of the rankings that have lots of active players will tend bump the players around them to the end of the line at the same time the seeds from that area are chosen
2011-11-01T00:48:35  <ChrisH_> janzert: the extremes of the skill levels may behave differently than the wide middle. For example, even before the deactivation change xathis was getting fewer games than the rest of the top 20. I think because of the skill gap.
2011-11-01T00:49:10  <ChrisH_> janzert: but a lot of those getting bumped will be deactivated submissions, which doesn't help other's looking for seeds slots
2011-11-01T00:49:10  <janzert> yes, the ends of the rankings do tend to get a few less games
2011-11-01T00:49:22  <a1k0n> do you match based on mu or skill?
2011-11-01T00:49:42  <a1k0n> or.. some integral over the distribution of skill

2011-11-01T00:50:31  <janzert> re the ends of the rankings, a few less games right now is a rather large percentage of course :/

2011-11-01T00:52:35  <mayanks43> Is there a time limit for activation after deactivation?
2011-11-01T00:53:00  <ChrisH_> and with an average player count per game around 5.5, it only takes one new starter bot to keep 4.5 others playing games.
2011-11-01T00:55:38  <janzert> you seem to be saying that a few active starter bots will keep them all active while at the same time saying the same won't happen at the top of the rankings ;)
2011-11-01T00:56:08  <janzert> I believe the top is more likely to stay above the threshold and hope that the starter range will gradually fall below it

2011-11-01T00:56:55  <ChrisH_> janzert: not exactly, I'm saying that the intent of the change as I understand it is to bias the scheduling against starter bots, but it doesn't really do that as long as new starter bots are submitted at a modest rate
2011-11-01T00:57:30  <janzert> this initial deployment is the time period when it is most likely reversed of course
2011-11-01T00:57:30  <zigner22> Anyone knowledgeable about the C++ build system willing to discuss?
2011-11-01T00:57:59  <janzert> nah, the intent is to give people that aren't taking an active interest in the contest less resources
2011-11-01T00:58:15  <ChrisH_> janzert: the issues with the top bots are related to the boundary affect and the fact that very few of the top bots have clicked the activate button so far, so they are no better than starter bots in terms of activation rate, and probably worse as a percentage

2011-11-01T00:59:02  <Relax> If I may interject, is it reasonable to simply not run a bot with the same MD5 as a starter package more than once?
2011-11-01T00:59:11  <ChrisH_> janzert: ok, but it also has the unintended consequence that people who do take an active interest may lose out just because they are peers with others who do not take an active interest
2011-11-01T00:59:11  <janzert> right, the percentage of activated top bots is probably at it's worst right now

2011-11-01T01:01:03  <ChrisH_> but as time passes other skill ranges may experience a similar problem.  I don't know, and I'm not suggesting any specific solution, just trying to understand what has become a very non-deterministic system

2011-11-01T01:02:09  <janzert> Relax: we want to give the new player who has just submitted a starter bot more than one game to look at

2011-11-01T01:04:16  <grom358> thestinger: ping
2011-11-01T01:04:29  <ChrisH_> what I have observed over the last almost 24 hours since the change was implemented is that my bot now pretty much must be a seed to get a game, whereas before I would get pulled into games until my game rate prevented it
2011-11-01T01:05:01  <zigner22> @janzert & @Relax, just fyi, as a brand new player I ran several local games instead of doing anything on the server - a starter package running on the server would have little value to me.
2011-11-01T01:05:02  <contestbot> zigner22: An error occured while trying to show the previous error.
2011-11-01T01:05:03  <ChrisH_> and accounting for the down time earlier today my game rate has been cut roughly in half

2011-11-01T01:08:06  <ChrisH_> now, it's not that big of a deal because I know how my bot behaves and it hasn't changed recently, but a new top submission like cumbuz may get frustrated not getting many games now that he has gotten up to #15
2011-11-01T01:08:38  <janzert> ideally we could just give everyone more games :}
2011-11-01T01:08:49  <ChrisH_> LOL
2011-11-01T01:08:52  <burny> in an ideal world :P
2011-11-01T01:09:23  <burny> but, it's probably worth a bit of effort, to make the games that are played: be more inline, with the competitors interest value in the games
2011-11-01T01:09:52  <burny> most notably.. people who are active, get more games, and people who submited 2weeks ago and then quit.. don't get many atall
2011-11-01T01:12:08  <janzert> that's the general aim of deactivating bots ;)

2011-11-01T01:13:03  <ChrisH_> janzert: as we approach the 24 hour mark since the change was rolled out, I would be very curious to see the results of some stats of game rates for activated bots vs. deactivated bots to see if there is a bias being introduced as intended or not

2011-11-01T01:17:04  <grom358> thestinger: just working on this BFS idea. How do you deal with when food is collected and when you find new water tiles?
2011-11-01T01:17:15  <burny> 2 stages of priority, and a static 3day duration
2011-11-01T01:17:52  <thestinger> grom358: I regenerate the pathfinding maps each turn, it's map enough that it doesn't matter
2011-11-01T01:17:57  <thestinger> fast enough* (lol)
2011-11-01T01:18:11  <grom358> thestinger: ah.. kk.. that is what I was going todo.. was just checking
2011-11-01T01:18:14  <ChrisH_> grom358: same here
2011-11-01T01:18:30  <grom358> thestinger: I was thinking I could cache the values to each target if need be
2011-11-01T01:18:51  <grom358> so each tile has priority queue
2011-11-01T01:19:06  <grom358> and I just remove the item off the queue when it no longer there
2011-11-01T01:19:16  <burny> janz, I think the results of that deactivation, will result in roughly 50% more games for active players: but also result in less useless encounters, for weak players
2011-11-01T01:19:41  <ChrisH_> grom358: or you could cache for two turns if you need to, water would never be a problem, and food probably won't dissappear if it's inside your attack radius, so it should work most all the time
2011-11-01T01:19:47  <burny> deactivated bots are selected less often as opponents right? not just omited from being seeders?
2011-11-01T01:20:04  <ChrisH_> grom358: and a two turn cache is half as many searches, for double the speed

2011-11-01T01:21:06  <grom358> yeah.. and if I want to make one target a priority I just weight it to have better score.. like defend my own hill
2011-11-01T01:21:21  <grom358> I can make it twice as good as other targets :)

2011-11-01T01:22:15  <ChrisH_> grom358: yep, or what I do is start it with a lower initial score so that the search expands it for some # of moves before other goals

2011-11-01T01:24:26  <grom358> how do you do exploring? BFS from the ant and stop at first unseen tile? and reduce the score of the tiles that take you to unexplored areas?
2011-11-01T01:24:38  <ChrisH_> thestinger: thanks, it is some interesting code that basically makes sure the area surrounding my hill is covered by attack radii of my ants, it is sufficiently compute expensive that I incrementally build up the point sets at different distances from the hill with any extra time at the end of each turn
2011-11-01T01:25:12  <ChrisH_> thestinger: especially on 8 hill maps ;)
2011-11-01T01:26:07  <ChrisH_> grom358: ?1: lower is better because it reduces the "distance" to the target
2011-11-01T01:26:30  <thestinger> yeah, atm I mark a target with 0 and do the BFS from there, incrementing distance each time
2011-11-01T01:26:41  <thestinger> you could start a target at 5 or 10 to only attract the ants that are really close
2011-11-01T01:27:04  <thestinger> assuming you put multiple targets into one 2d array/graph
2011-11-01T01:27:28  <ChrisH_> grom358: ?2: that's not even close to how I do exploration, and it isn't easy to explain either, but it starts with keeping track of the last turn I saw every tile on the map (zero is never)
2011-11-01T01:28:03  <ChrisH_> and using that to send my ants to regions for which I have the stalest information, with a bonus for areas I've never seen
2011-11-01T01:28:27  <grom358> yeah. that is what I want todo
2011-11-01T01:29:10  <grom358> but when you first start the map.. how to pick the first target when heaps of tiles are at never seen
2011-11-01T01:29:38  <ChrisH_> I break ties by distance from my hills
2011-11-01T01:30:04  <ChrisH_> but that is just because the BFS finds them first

2011-11-01T01:31:05  <ChrisH_> as the fog of war is rolled back the explore points move out as well
2011-11-01T01:31:18  <grom358> ties by distance.. but at the start you got a bunch of unseen tiles at the same distance.. do you just random which one?
2011-11-01T01:31:49  <ChrisH_> well, once I pick a point I won't pick another within view radius of it, so there aren't that many in reality

2011-11-01T01:39:44  <ChrisH_> grom358: once I get to the pathfinding stage, yes, sounds the same as what i'm doing, assuming you mean that you increase the score when you expand the neighbors of a tile
2011-11-01T01:40:34  <ChrisH_> grom358: and yes, I also search from goals towards ants, in case you were asking about the direction as well
2011-11-01T01:40:50  <grom358> yeah as I expand I increasing the score.. only adding tiles to the search queue if they have worse score
2011-11-01T01:40:55  <grom358> so the BFS can stop early

2011-11-01T01:59:50  <thestinger> atm, I loop through the directions and stop if that direction brings me closer AND I can move there - if it's blocked by an idle ant I push it onto a list

2011-11-01T02:00:32  <ChrisH_> well, I don't know if this is the best thing to do, but I break the tie based on the lowest sum of the second neighbors out, and if that is a tie then it is just the first one I find, maybe also depending on if there are other ants in those tiles.
2011-11-01T02:00:38  <thestinger> I keep the blocked by idle ant lists for ants that couldn't move and loop through them later

2011-11-01T02:02:53  <ChrisH_> at one point I randomly permuted the order I looked in each direction for each ant, but I don't think I do that anymore. It turns out my first tie breaker has some benefits when multiple foods are nearby, and after that I just don't care

2011-11-01T02:06:21  <grom358> I don't want to BFS from each one of them.. so I could narrow it down by distance to ant.. maybe
2011-11-01T02:06:35  <grom358> idk if I follow what you saying about that
2011-11-01T02:06:51  <ChrisH_> grom358: I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader.  ;)
2011-11-01T02:07:14  <grom358> yeah I got the other part worked out
2011-11-01T02:07:25  <grom358> just unseen tiles .... there so many of them
2011-11-01T02:07:27  <thestinger> I do a BFS from each unseen location, but most of the searches don't ever do more than 4 iterations because I do it all on the same 2d array
2011-11-01T02:07:36  <ChrisH_> grom358: if you look back at the IRC logs from earlier today or yesterday I talked with some other folks about some tricks I do with BFS that might give you some ideas
2011-11-01T02:07:56  <ChrisH_> yeah, what thestinger said
2011-11-01T02:08:19  <grom358> oh.. i see
2011-11-01T02:08:36  <grom358> after you done one BFS.. the rest gonna be rather fast
2011-11-01T02:08:46  <ChrisH_> thestinger: do you do it from EVERY unseen point, or some subset of them that you think are good targets?
2011-11-01T02:08:58  <thestinger> atm, I do it for every one but I'm going to change that
2011-11-01T02:09:06  <thestinger> my bot is still really basic (I'm new to this stuff :P)
2011-11-01T02:09:07  <ChrisH_> ok, that's where we differ atm
2011-11-01T02:09:34  <grom358> yeah an idea I had
2011-11-01T02:09:43  <thestinger> I might just pick a subset that are far from my hill, perhaps in areas I think an enemy hill might be
2011-11-01T02:09:48  <grom358> was try to pick an unseen that has a lot of other unseen tiles around it
2011-11-01T02:09:58  <ChrisH_> grom358: now your thinking
2011-11-01T02:10:12  <ChrisH_> that's what my code is trying to do as well
2011-11-01T02:10:42  <ChrisH_> maximize how much new information one ant can give you
2011-11-01T02:10:58  <grom358> yeah..
2011-11-01T02:11:06  <thestinger> once I get combat stuff implemented, I might explore in pairs or something
2011-11-01T02:11:16  <grom358> well I already have functions that get tiles within view radius of another
2011-11-01T02:11:22  <ChrisH_> i'm working on combat code now
2011-11-01T02:11:44  <thestinger> ChrisH_: do you just try to avoid enemy ants right now?
2011-11-01T02:12:13  <ChrisH_> for ants going for food or exploring, yes
2011-11-01T02:12:39  <ChrisH_> ants defending the hill or attacking enemy hills just ignore enemy ants and hope for the best

2011-11-01T02:14:25  <grom358> my idea for attacking is.. make the number of ants in direction of hill more then the enemy before going in attack radius
2011-11-01T02:14:25  <ChrisH_> I'm hoping to "unify" my ant behaviors by getting some good combat logic that can switch on when needed so that I can be more aggressive but also more safe
2011-11-01T02:14:57  <ChrisH_> still working on the details

2011-11-01T02:24:14  <grom358> how do you avoid sending the more than one ant to food?
2011-11-01T02:25:28  <ChrisH_> once the BFS reaches an ant for a particular food then the food targets are removed from the search, along with all the tiles expanded from that food, that part gets tricky, but it's not too bad

2011-11-01T02:27:42  <grom358> ChrisH_: how do you remove them.. I got 2D array with score for each tile. As I search I'm replacing the score.. so how can you remove the scores?
2011-11-01T02:28:15  <stocha> thanks. good idea i guess.
2011-11-01T02:29:28  <stocha> now it go as fast as a game every 3 hours.
2011-11-01T02:29:31  <ChrisH_> grom358: store the "prior" tile that each tile's score was generated from, or propogate a reference to the original target tile into each tile's minimum came from.

2011-11-01T02:30:07  <stocha> are you discussing path finding ?
2011-11-01T02:30:14  <thestinger> ChrisH_: do you reuse ants for getting 2+ food at all? I know it will happen anyway, but do you avoid sending 2 ants to 2 food that are next to each other?
2011-11-01T02:30:26  <ChrisH_> that helps you find the tiles needing removing, but patching up the BFS so it can continue needs careful thought to do it right
2011-11-01T02:30:45  <ChrisH_> thestinger: yes
2011-11-01T02:30:48  <ChrisH_> stocha: yes
2011-11-01T02:31:22  <thestinger> ah, so the way you're doing it you can remove nearby food from the search too?
2011-11-01T02:31:32  <grom358> mmm.. I thinking I should maybe store a set of scores for each tile like I was thinking before
2011-11-01T02:31:39  <stocha> why did the designer think it was good not to get score for killing ants ?
2011-11-01T02:31:56  <grom358> that way.. I can easily remove targets out for other ants
2011-11-01T02:33:02  <ChrisH_> thestinger: yes, and I can also define goals that require any number of ants to satisfy, which is how I plan rushes on enemy hills
2011-11-01T02:33:53  <ChrisH_> if I keep this up I might as well just give you guys my code.  ;)
2011-11-01T02:34:04  <stocha> good idea
2011-11-01T02:34:35  <stocha> although i don't know what i'll do with a go log.
2011-11-01T02:34:39  <stocha> what IS go ?
2011-11-01T02:34:40  <ChrisH_> except it's against the rules.
2011-11-01T02:34:48  <grom358> well the thing is.. I actually had BFS for food already with my current A* bot. I record all ants that are within view radius of the food
2011-11-01T02:34:54  <stocha> i mean it used to be a chineese game in the old days.
2011-11-01T02:35:14  <grom358> I end up with list of all food to ant routes
2011-11-01T02:35:28  <ChrisH_> stocha: yes, the game of go is cool, but you can read about the programming language here:  http://golang.org/
2011-11-01T02:35:34  <grom358> then I loop through that picking the shortest routes first.. and making sure not to assign two ants to one food

2011-11-01T02:37:00  <grom358> so I could change that so.. I give the assigned ant a reference to the BFS results. The ant picks the tile with lowest score from the sets of BFS results it has been assigned
2011-11-01T02:37:27  <grom358> then I can assign an ant both an enemy hill and food

2011-11-01T02:39:55  <ChrisH_> keep in mind, though, that the reason I find BFS faster than A* for my bot is by combining multiple BFS's into one that produces multiple paths, so could you do that with hills and food for example?
2011-11-01T02:40:07  <grom358> yeah
2011-11-01T02:40:12  <ChrisH_> good
2011-11-01T02:40:40  <grom358> basically I get the BFS to return a Map<Tile,Integer>

2011-11-01T02:41:08  <stocha> ChrisH_: how is it different from java ?
2011-11-01T02:41:12  <grom358> that is.. a tile and its score to the target
2011-11-01T02:41:37  <grom358> so when an ant looks at its adjacent tiles.. it looks in each map it been assigned
2011-11-01T02:41:54  <stocha> there seems to be some good python bot at the moment. Nobody use the computing time or is python just very fast ?
2011-11-01T02:42:12  <ChrisH_> stocha: it's more like a mix of C and Python but with natives for threading and an interesting take on interfaces.
2011-11-01T02:42:13  <grom358> picks the score with lowest value for that tile.. then compares its adjacent tiles from there
2011-11-01T02:42:22  <stocha> i certainly don't have that much computing time for what i would do if i decided to participate :p
2011-11-01T02:43:12  <grom358> and if a tile is blocked by another ant.. I try the next best tile
2011-11-01T02:43:16  <ChrisH_> stocha: it has been challenging to stay within the 500ms turn time.
2011-11-01T02:43:25  <stocha> i uploaded an old bot that was meant for the old ant game. It did poorly at the time. But now it seems to do rather well. Considering it doesn't know the Hill syntax.
2011-11-01T02:43:51  <stocha> ChrisH_: how do the python guy do it then ? is python time efficient ?
2011-11-01T02:44:48  <stocha> GarySWest is 4. If you can trust the ranking.
2011-11-01T02:45:07  <ChrisH_> stocha: I'm not sure, but I think python can be efficient with the right libraries, or psycho JIT, I'm not sure what they have available on the servers for python to go fast.
2011-11-01T02:45:38  <stocha> what do you do for a living chrisH ?
2011-11-01T02:45:50  <ChrisH_> GarySWest's bot is pretty tough in the current field, but ther is lots of time to improve, so we'll see where everyone ends up in several weeks.

2011-11-01T02:49:55  <ChrisH_> I agree with that.
2011-11-01T02:49:55  <stocha> without too much stress.
2011-11-01T02:50:19  <stocha> so i guess i have a pretty decent situation right now. But for the fact that the futur is a bit hard to anticipate.
2011-11-01T02:50:47  <stocha> And then, it's probably not that exciting algorithmically wise.
2011-11-01T02:50:58  <stocha> who needs algorithm nowaday anyway.
2011-11-01T02:51:07  <ChrisH_> Google
2011-11-01T02:51:13  <stocha> do they ?
2011-11-01T02:51:25  <ChrisH_> that's what I've heard
2011-11-01T02:51:40  <stocha> i'm not sure they'll ask for that here in france.
2011-11-01T02:51:50  <ChrisH_> I guess it depends what you consider an algorithm though.
2011-11-01T02:52:06  <stocha> then it may also be that i'm just to good at it not to want to do some, and to bad at it to be very competitive when there is so few demands.
2011-11-01T02:52:24  <stocha> like djikstra's stuff i guess.
2011-11-01T02:52:45  <stocha> or i don't know, some stuff about multithread programming.
2011-11-01T02:53:15  <stocha> Games do have a demande for algorithm. But do they want to pay good money for it ?
2011-11-01T02:53:16  <ChrisH_> I think the challenge is combining good algorithms and implementations with good game strategy.
2011-11-01T02:53:38  <stocha> Yeah. What you really need a is language in the end.
2011-11-01T02:53:45  <stocha> Good language is everything.
2011-11-01T02:54:08  <stocha> Although i guess nobody understand what "language" just really means :p
2011-11-01T02:54:14  <stocha> i certainly don't.
2011-11-01T02:54:45  <stocha> It's fascinating how we don't understand how to speak and parse pseaches yet.

2011-11-01T03:22:30  <thestinger> I actually considered using boost graph but I just rolled by own A* due to the include path thing
2011-11-01T03:22:44  <thestinger> I'm not actually using my A* implementation for anything anymore so it wouldn't have mattered anyway :P
2011-11-01T03:24:16  <paulwal> Hey guys
2011-11-01T03:24:19  <zigner22> there are quite a few other graph algo's in there that might be useful too.
2011-11-01T03:25:00  <zigner22> thestinger: well, its good to know that I wasn't missing some easy solution..
2011-11-01T03:25:07  <zigner22> ( unless we both are ).

2011-11-01T03:25:59  <zigner22> it certinaly can be.
2011-11-01T03:25:59  <thestinger> they make .o files and then link them together, but those .o files aren't ever reused so there was no point of making them

2011-11-01T03:26:34  <zigner22> they may get used by several different link operations.
2011-11-01T03:26:38  <thestinger> gcc -o binary file.c file2.c file3.c would make more sense, and I think that results in better code (because they aren't using -flto)
2011-11-01T03:27:10  <zigner22> well ... on a bigger project.
2011-11-01T03:27:19  <thestinger> yeah memory issues :P
2011-11-01T03:27:39  <zigner22> hehe, at work we just got to a point were we have to use a 64bit compiler.
2011-11-01T03:28:38  <zigner22> ( not really a good thing, but too expensive to change architecture at current point in the project )

2011-11-01T03:36:46  <bqf> paulwal: impossible to say right now. most of the tops bots are still from the challenge's beta phase, so they had months to deal with the icky parts of fighting, for example. we should be seeing some newcomers soon. well, hopefully. if the challenge stays in the hands of the early beta testers, i'll be pretty disappointed with this whole thing.

2011-11-01T04:45:59  <thestinger> it works \o/
2011-11-01T04:46:37  <emilk> C+11 would be sweet to use
2011-11-01T04:46:46  <emilk> haven't even gotten the chance to play around with it at all yet
2011-11-01T04:47:38  <mleise> nah, I switched to D :)
2011-11-01T04:48:10  <thestinger> emilk: I just wanted it for unordered_set and unordered_map tbh
2011-11-01T04:48:45  <mleise> aka a hash ?
2011-11-01T04:48:47  <thestinger> well, a sane way to iterate through an iterator with a for loop is also sane
2011-11-01T04:48:49  <thestinger> yeah, hash tables
2011-11-01T04:49:01  <emilk> didn't even know C++0x had hash tables... I'm so behind

2011-11-01T04:50:09  <thestinger> yeah, I tested with std::vector<std::vector<int>> :P
2011-11-01T04:50:11  <mleise> emilk, thestinger: http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/hash-map.html
2011-11-01T04:50:17  <Migi32> unfortunately, since they're only using gcc 4.5 and not 4.6, the nice for-loops aren't enabled yet...
2011-11-01T04:50:22  <emilk> thestinger: the most valuable improvement by far ;)
2011-11-01T04:50:29  <thestinger> mleise: yeah, all sane languages have hash tables :P
2011-11-01T04:50:54  <emilk> Migi32: but at least 'auto' instead if  std::vector<int>::const_iterator  should work, right?
2011-11-01T04:51:25  <Migi32> yeah, those work
2011-11-01T04:51:37  <emilk> mleise: we are discussing C++11.

2011-11-01T04:54:09  <sas4eka> Java Starter Package makes me cry :(  Scanner for each input line - and now 300 first-turn water squares on multihill maps makes starter bot work 500+ ms on the 1st turn
2011-11-01T04:54:48  <thestinger> the C++ starter bot is kind of silly
2011-11-01T04:54:52  <emilk> sas4eka: I think the idea is that you should improve upon the starter package :)
2011-11-01T04:55:06  <thestinger> they use two classes to hold what are essentially dozens of global variables
2011-11-01T04:55:24  <Migi32> you have more time the first turn though. turntime+loadtime
2011-11-01T04:55:48  <mleise> emilk: I know you were discussing C++11. I was just mentioning D, because it tries to be a fresh start to C++, so might be a choice for people who want auto, hash tables etc.

2011-11-01T04:57:09  <thestinger> don't you have to code iOS apps in objective-C?
2011-11-01T04:57:17  <emilk> no, C++ works fine
2011-11-01T04:57:27  <emilk> just the interface to the native libraries need to be ObjC
2011-11-01T04:57:40  <mleise> emilk: I have no Apple hardware. It is hard to tell for me. The compilers work on Windows, Linux and MacOS X at least.
2011-11-01T04:57:55  <thestinger> I like that you can code android apps in scala :)
2011-11-01T04:57:59  <emilk> mleise: fair enough - quite an off-topic question anyway
2011-11-01T04:58:22  <thestinger> I haven't learned scala yet, but it looks pretty good and I plan on doing some android devel
2011-11-01T04:58:28  <emilk> can you interface to C++ code in D at least?
2011-11-01T04:58:33  <sas4eka> I've already improved. But most people with Java package gonna have timeout one day.
2011-11-01T04:58:52  <bobbydroptable> most of the top 10 bots are written in java =="
2011-11-01T04:59:22  <Migi32> I really like some of the features D has. But then it chose to do garbage collection, which adds an unacceptable overhead to me... :(
2011-11-01T04:59:37  <mleise> emilk: Partially, yes. But don't expect too much. These are two different languages. It supports C interfaces fully though.

2011-11-01T05:01:09  <thestinger> once D has a proper LLVM or GCC frontend, I'll try it - the dmd2 compiler is crap from my short experience with it (doesn't say anything about the language)
2011-11-01T05:01:19  <thestinger> I mean for D2

2011-11-01T05:02:00  <thestinger> I think so
2011-11-01T05:02:02  <ikaros> ok
2011-11-01T05:02:04  <emilk> d1 only from the looks of it

2011-11-01T05:02:23  <emilk> looked at it 10 years ago last time...
2011-11-01T05:02:27  <ikaros> =)
2011-11-01T05:02:37  <Migi32> did it exist back then already?

2011-11-01T05:28:51  <SharkMonkey> I changed the sources in my Makefile from .cc .cpp and renamed my source file.
2011-11-01T05:28:56  <SharkMonkey> Then ran "make clean"
2011-11-01T05:29:06  <SharkMonkey> and the makefile deleted my source files =(
2011-11-01T05:29:47  <SharkMonkey> Lost a few hours of in the zone work.

2011-11-01T05:31:39  <emilk> 10:08 < mleise> thx :D Unfortunately writing tools seems to be more fun than actually coding the bot logic
2011-11-01T05:31:42  <emilk> amen =)
2011-11-01T05:32:02  <mayanks43> when does timeout happen?
2011-11-01T05:32:03  <SharkMonkey> OBJECTS=$(SOURCES:.cc=o)
2011-11-01T05:32:17  <SharkMonkey> mayanks43, When your bot doesn't respond within the timeout period
2011-11-01T05:32:24  <mayanks43> ok
2011-11-01T05:32:47  <SharkMonkey> Not adjusting OBJECTS was my mistake.
2011-11-01T05:33:19  <SharkMonkey> mayanks43, It's 500ms on the server. 1000ms by default with the playgame.py script.
2011-11-01T05:33:21  <thestinger> you should get rid of the magic they use in the Makefile imo - I don't like using wildcards for stuff like that
2011-11-01T05:33:51  <mayanks43> so it's because my algos are taking too much time

2011-11-01T05:52:49  <ikaros> that makefile should be change to output binaries in a "build" subfolder or something

2011-11-01T05:53:41  <thestinger> or it could just have a target for each .o file and rm -f them manually, there are only 3
2011-11-01T05:54:22  <thestinger> well I mean the clean target would do 'rm -f one.o two.o three.o', instead of using the variable created from a wildcard

2011-11-01T07:23:31  <thestinger> you need to wrap anything that does a system call in a try: except:
2011-11-01T07:23:45  <thestinger> a lock file will work better (keep going as long as the file is there)
2011-11-01T07:28:14  <thestinger> Migi32: just do 'import os' up top and then replace the infinite loop for rounds == -1 with 'while os.path.exists('run.lock')'

2011-11-01T07:29:46  <Migi32> now let me google how to write to files in python :)
2011-11-01T07:30:18  <tmc2> open('filename','w').write("blarg")
2011-11-01T07:30:33  <tmc2> maybe you could read from standard input
2011-11-01T07:30:50  <tmc2> and if the user presses 'q', say, quit after the next game
2011-11-01T07:31:32  <Migi32> can you do a non-blocking read?
2011-11-01T07:31:52  <Migi32> well, it doesn't really matter, I'm ok with thr lock-file thing
2011-11-01T07:32:35  <Da_Blitz> why dont you catch "KeyboardInterrupt" in yout main loop (ctrl+c) and set a flag thats read before startign the next game
2011-11-01T07:33:04  <tmc2> oh yeah, that's easiest :P
2011-11-01T07:33:09  <bysin> signal(SIGINT, handler);
2011-11-01T07:33:18  <tmc2> and you could ctrl+C twice to force kill
2011-11-01T07:33:45  <tmc2> wait a minute, then you would have to resume where you were after the ctrl+C; can you do that?
2011-11-01T07:33:54  <tmc2> *before the ctrl+C
2011-11-01T07:34:17  <Migi32> the exception thing will be hard to do properly, because if it has already received orders it will forget about them
2011-11-01T07:35:21  <thestinger> Migi32: you can just open('run.lock', 'w') to make it
2011-11-01T07:37:07  <thestinger> tmc2: you can, but you have to wrap all the library calls that do IO and stuff in try: except WhateverSignalException: because they'll be interrupted if you get a signal
2011-11-01T07:37:46  <tmc2> actually a KeyboardInterrupt could be raised at any statement
2011-11-01T07:38:14  <Migi32> I think bysin's suggestion of signal(SIGINT, handler); is the best solution here

2011-11-01T07:40:53  <thestinger> there's a caveat in python that makes it unwieldy, I tried doing it with SIGINT and SIGUSR1 but the I/O calls will raise exceptions instead of continuing after the signal
2011-11-01T07:41:30  <Migi32> ah

2011-11-01T07:41:43  <Da_Blitz> if you have an event loop for handling IO then that is less of an issue, also gives you a chance to use signalfd

2011-11-01T08:06:02  * antimatroid is wondering when some new good bots will be out to play
2011-11-01T08:06:19  <antimatroid> although i see that fluxid is in the top 10?
2011-11-01T08:06:19  <jnwhiteh> I really want to get into the contest, but I've just got too much work to do =/
2011-11-01T08:06:22  <antimatroid> i was about to say that looks uncahnged
2011-11-01T08:06:49  <antimatroid> jnwhiteh: same atm, but i'm keeping an eye on the leaderboard
2011-11-01T08:07:54  <Migi32> antimatroid, my next version should be pretty decent all-round
2011-11-01T08:08:03  <antimatroid> :)
2011-11-01T08:08:21  <antimatroid> i want to see xathis knocked off top
2011-11-01T08:08:28  <jnwhiteh> the performance of the top 10 is really impressifve
2011-11-01T08:08:29  <Migi32> oh like that
2011-11-01T08:08:39  <Migi32> yeah it won't do that
2011-11-01T08:08:54  <Migi32> maybe like top 30 or something
2011-11-01T08:09:19  <antimatroid> that's a start
2011-11-01T08:09:23  <antimatroid> :P

2011-11-01T08:10:03  <antimatroid> i handed my thesis in today, that's a start
2011-11-01T08:10:12  <antimatroid> xathis: i just want some competition :P
2011-11-01T08:10:19  <antimatroid> you can come back and beat them again later
2011-11-01T08:10:45  <antimatroid> oh that's what i always wanted to do
2011-11-01T08:10:53  <antimatroid> how do i get the south koreans to see this contest?
2011-11-01T08:11:02  <antimatroid> i imagine they've got a bunch of people who could be interested

2011-11-01T08:13:54  <jnwhiteh> on the visualizer what are the circles that appear around the hills?
2011-11-01T08:14:01  <jnwhiteh> I don't see any information about it on the webpage

2011-11-01T08:14:54  <tmc2> the radius is the distance to the nearest enemy ant
2011-11-01T08:14:59  <jnwhiteh> ah, interesting
2011-11-01T08:15:07  <jnwhiteh> is that communicated, or just part of the visual display?
2011-11-01T08:15:22  <tmc2> calculated by visualizer
2011-11-01T08:15:37  <tmc2> the circles are spoilers though :(
2011-11-01T08:15:46  <tmc2> you can see whether or not an attack will succeed
2011-11-01T08:15:59  <jnwhiteh> hrm
2011-11-01T08:16:06  <tmc2> of course without them you would never notice the hills getting razed

2011-11-01T08:18:08  <tmc2> yes it does

2011-11-01T08:18:26  <tmc2> if an enemy ant gets within one tile of a hill but is killed, no circle is shown
2011-11-01T08:18:44  <antimatroid> hmmm, i wonder why that is
2011-11-01T08:18:59  <tmc2> to clearly indicate which hills are about to be razed

2011-11-01T09:11:10  <Migi32> I see that many good players simply don't defend their hills. Even if they have many ants, they leave it out of vision sometimes. Why?
2011-11-01T09:12:46  <emilk> hush! it is so that you and I can exploit their weakness!
2011-11-01T09:12:57  <emilk> (or maybe the cover all entrances to their hill?)
2011-11-01T09:14:09  <Migi32> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.15603 <- Zulfaqir, turn 34. If no ant were to spawn there, there's a way to sneak up on his base.

2011-11-01T10:10:09  <roflmao> not to mention the opponents were just....
2011-11-01T10:11:04  <roflmao> all my opponents have been rather bad so far actually

2011-11-01T10:12:20  <jnwhiteh> but i've caught a few times where it should have triggered but didn't because the ant failed to raze

2011-11-01T10:13:17  <tmc2> those high food games scare me
2011-11-01T10:14:06  <tmc2> someone ought to run a TCP server for pure-combat games
2011-11-01T10:14:19  <tmc2> no food, and you start with a squad of ants
2011-11-01T10:14:47  <tmc2> maybe without hills (score determined by kills instead of razed hills)
2011-11-01T10:14:54  <Hexren> as a raincheck for me, how do you guys handle the remaining time so that you dont timeout ? I do checks when I iterate over something with the value from the tutorial  (10ms) so if I iterate over my ants to tell them to go somewheer I check before each ant if I more than 10ms left and if not, end my turn
2011-11-01T10:15:12  <roflmao> I, for example, stop computing pathfinds
2011-11-01T10:15:17  <roflmao> if my remaining time gets too low
2011-11-01T10:15:31  <tmc2> I'm a little nervous about 10 ms being a low margin
2011-11-01T10:15:51  <Hexren> what is too low in ms for you roflmao ?
2011-11-01T10:15:52  <roflmao> hexren: but I'd say generally the best way is to optimize so you don't time out at all :)
2011-11-01T10:16:10  <roflmao> I currently have my pathfinding to stop when it hits 250ms which is a bit generous

2011-11-01T10:16:19  <Hexren> ok
2011-11-01T10:16:30  <Hexren> what do you use for pathfinding ? I use A*
2011-11-01T10:16:33  <roflmao> same
2011-11-01T10:16:47  <tmc2> the timer starts later, after all
2011-11-01T10:16:50  <roflmao> i want to implement some bfs for ant hill razing
2011-11-01T10:16:58  <Hexren> bfs ?
2011-11-01T10:16:58  <roflmao> and fix some of the pathfinding for ants
2011-11-01T10:17:03  <roflmao> breadth-first search
2011-11-01T10:17:03  <tmc2> not at the moment that the engine counts from
2011-11-01T10:17:07  <Hexren> ah ok
2011-11-01T10:17:09  <tmc2> so a 10ms might be more like 7ms
2011-11-01T10:17:17  <tmc2> *10ms margin
2011-11-01T10:17:34  <roflmao> because computing a* paths for like 60 ants would be waaay too greedy
2011-11-01T10:17:36  <Hexren> I'll try upping that then :)
2011-11-01T10:17:46  <roflmao> also — make sure your a* is wrapping
2011-11-01T10:17:52  <roflmao> and only compute pathfinds for nearby foods

2011-11-01T10:18:01  <roflmao> if you can see a food ALWAYS choose the closest ant
2011-11-01T10:18:11  <tmc2> that's not optimal
2011-11-01T10:18:12  <roflmao> cause otherwise you are going to get some reaaaaaly greedy a* pathfinds
2011-11-01T10:18:47  <tmc2> it's actually better not to turn an ant that's exploring around to collect food if there's another one coming up behind it, but further from the food
2011-11-01T10:18:49  <Hexren> is there an inteligent way to simulate the runtime enviroement on the challenge servers ? Purely feeling based, I'd say my bot that times out ion the challenge server doesnt time out on my workstation. I didnt ind an entry on the homepage or the forum where the enviroment on the challenge server is described
2011-11-01T10:19:18  <roflmao> tmc2: yeah, true.
2011-11-01T10:19:33  <Hexren> the a* is wrapping thanks :)
2011-11-01T10:19:34  <tmc2> well, what are you asking for, machine specs?
2011-11-01T10:19:44  <roflmao> hexren: i think the best way is just to limit the ms locally if your machine is faster
2011-11-01T10:19:45  <driing> Does the view radius wrap around the map too?
2011-11-01T10:19:49  <tmc2> the machines are 64 bit ubuntu EC2 instances
2011-11-01T10:19:55  <roflmao> driing: yes
2011-11-01T10:20:05  <driing> Ok thanks!
2011-11-01T10:20:19  <Relax> Hexren: One thing I didn't realize is that the official servers run with 500ms/turn, while the defaults in playgame.py are 1000ms/turn
2011-11-01T10:20:34  <tmc2> there are other differences in the settings too
2011-11-01T10:20:42  <tmc2> the food rates are different!
2011-11-01T10:20:44  <Hexren> Relax, jup that kinda sucks yes
2011-11-01T10:21:12  <tmc2> so I strongly recommend you go check you're using the same food rate
2011-11-01T10:21:23  <roflmao> where do you see the machine instances tmc2?
2011-11-01T10:21:40  <roflmao> specs
2011-11-01T10:21:43  <roflmao> sorry, brain fart
2011-11-01T10:21:47  <tmc2> well one of the organisers said what type of instances they're using, I'll go look

2011-11-01T10:22:14  <Hexren> thanks for the help, propably be back in a bit when I try the tcp servers
2011-11-01T10:22:17  <tmc2> that was the last contest
2011-11-01T10:22:23  <roflmao> hexren: tcp servers are MUCH harder
2011-11-01T10:22:32  <roflmao> hexren: so I've heard :P
2011-11-01T10:22:32  <tmc2> really?
2011-11-01T10:22:45  <roflmao> yeah i think the turn limit there is 5 secs
2011-11-01T10:22:53  <roflmao> so some of the bots are pretty damn smart
2011-11-01T10:22:53  <Hexren> this isnt a fairytale or so I've heard *this is sparta* ;)
2011-11-01T10:22:57  <tmc2> ah, they are using linux.m2.xlarge

2011-11-01T10:25:40  <tmc2> wait what
2011-11-01T10:25:45  <tmc2> only 2 cores?
2011-11-01T10:25:56  <tmc2> why do they need so much ram for only 2 bots at a time
2011-11-01T10:26:05  <roflmao> also, tmc, a revision on what you said: never pick pathfind an ant to a food that is out of the ant's LOS
2011-11-01T10:26:08  <tmc2> oh right, they all have to stay in memory even if not running
2011-11-01T10:26:20  <tmc2> so if there are 10 bots, they get get about 1.6GB of memory each
2011-11-01T10:26:26  <roflmao> heh nice
2011-11-01T10:26:27  <tmc2> *each get
2011-11-01T10:26:42  <tmc2> why not?

2011-11-01T10:26:48  <tmc2> hahah
2011-11-01T10:26:54  <roflmao> tmc2: because otherwise it costs too much
2011-11-01T10:27:03  <roflmao> tcm2: and it means there are closer ants you could pick
2011-11-01T10:27:15  <roflmao> tmc2: or maybe my pathfinding is terribly unoptimized ;P
2011-11-01T10:27:19  <tmc2> what about food that's outside the sight of all your ants?
2011-11-01T10:27:24  <roflmao> ah, that's different
2011-11-01T10:27:37  <roflmao> then you can do whatever I guess, but if you have a food in your los
2011-11-01T10:27:37  <tmc2> they're paying for a lot of RAM but can only run 2 bots at once
2011-11-01T10:28:03  <roflmao> that's crazy
2011-11-01T10:28:14  <tmc2> also, I'm surprised they can average 3 games per minute with only 2 bots running at a time
2011-11-01T10:28:30  <Minthos> tmc2: but it's not like they can swap 8 gigs between turns
2011-11-01T10:28:31  <roflmao> do you handle the official servers, sir?
2011-11-01T10:28:56  <tmc2> yeah, but I mean ideal would be the same about of RAM but more cores
2011-11-01T10:29:09  <Minthos> agree

2011-11-01T10:44:52  <tmc2> btw someone on the forums posted a "wrapper" bot
2011-11-01T10:45:24  <Fluxid> but if you're able to run debugger with playgame.py, then you should able to do it with tcpclient
2011-11-01T10:45:29  <tmc2> which calls out to another bot, so that you can more easily debug it
2011-11-01T10:45:44  <tmc2> yes
2011-11-01T10:46:15  <Minthos> I think debugger is more suitable as a verb than a noun..
2011-11-01T10:46:50  <Fluxid> python's standard debugger runs in console, so it needs stdin/stdout to run... but winpdb may help
2011-11-01T10:47:11  <tmc2> hahah

2011-11-01T10:58:32  <Fluxid> tmc2: i think python implementation of trueskill is buggy, before it was using java implementation, but this used to crash, and because there was configuration option to switch between py/java versions, i used python
2011-11-01T10:59:09  <tmc2> oh!
2011-11-01T10:59:22  <tmc2> so is it identical to the one used on the official server?
2011-11-01T10:59:45  <Fluxid> i don't have motivation high enough to fix large portions of code, i do quick fixes instead..
2011-11-01T11:00:11  <Fluxid> tmc2: it uses trueskill, yes, but matching and possibly algorithm implementation isn't the same

2011-11-01T11:01:34  <roflmao> or how do you get stupid ants to get out of the initial base so effectively
2011-11-01T11:01:36  <Hexren> not yet
2011-11-01T11:01:45  <Hexren> what I do for exploring is:
2011-11-01T11:01:49  <Fluxid> i do
2011-11-01T11:01:54  <Hexren> mark where an ant originaly spawned
2011-11-01T11:01:56  <roflmao> and that is how you get ants out of base?
2011-11-01T11:02:02  <Fluxid> i do flood-fill from edges of unexplored part of map
2011-11-01T11:02:06  <Hexren> and when it has nothing bgetter to do
2011-11-01T11:02:15  <Hexren> I run away from taht point in a straigt line
2011-11-01T11:02:35  <Fluxid> and then ants go to cells with lower numbers. the lower, the closer it is to edge of unknown parts of map
2011-11-01T11:03:15  <roflmao> ah
2011-11-01T11:03:22  <roflmao> so farther away is more attractive
2011-11-01T11:04:06  <Fluxid> no
2011-11-01T11:04:15  <Fluxid> it goes to the closest unknown
2011-11-01T11:04:28  <roflmao> oh
2011-11-01T11:04:29  <Fluxid> but then it becomes known so ants go to other portions of map
2011-11-01T11:04:38  <roflmao> and once all is explored?
2011-11-01T11:04:47  <Fluxid> i try to keep map visible
2011-11-01T11:05:26  <Fluxid> my own ants repell each other, and i use the same algorithm as to explore map, to keep map visible: flood fill from edged of unvisible parts of map
2011-11-01T11:05:27  <roflmao> ants in fluxid have waaay more time, nice.

2011-11-01T11:09:47  <roflmao> ah
2011-11-01T11:09:49  <Fluxid> so the farther i fill, the larger the number

2011-11-01T11:11:29  <roflmao> and you are exploring the unexplored like marco polo
2011-11-01T11:12:20  <ikaros> hm so you basically mean a BFS ?
2011-11-01T11:12:27  <thestinger> yeah, it's basically a BFS

2011-11-01T11:12:38  <ikaros> sure
2011-11-01T11:12:47  <thestinger> but you don't need to keep track of visited nodes, you just compare the new value to the old value and only keep going if it's lower
2011-11-01T11:12:49  <Fluxid> and because destination doesn;t move, i don't need to repeat

2011-11-01T11:13:04  <thestinger> you can do it without any memory allocation if you preallocate the 2d array

2011-11-01T11:13:28  <roflmao> what determines the value
2011-11-01T11:13:32  <roflmao> or how
2011-11-01T11:13:38  <ikaros> my hill bfs runs until range of 50 max and needs no time at all
2011-11-01T11:13:43  <thestinger> so you have a 2d array of ints, you mark the target as 0
2011-11-01T11:13:51  <thestinger> you do a BFS outwards, incrementing by 1 each step
2011-11-01T11:14:10  <thestinger> so you get shortest paths (multiple ones) and distances for all locations to that target
2011-11-01T11:14:22  <Fluxid> yup yup yup
2011-11-01T11:14:25  <ikaros> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search
2011-11-01T11:14:29  <thestinger> you can also put more than one target into that array, and start them off at a value higher than 0 to give them a lower "priority"
2011-11-01T11:14:43  <Fluxid> yup!
2011-11-01T11:14:59  <roflmao> so bfs from edge of map back to ant
2011-11-01T11:15:00  <Fluxid> thestinger: oh wait! with that priority... didn't think of it!
2011-11-01T11:15:21  <roflmao> and use lowest cost path
2011-11-01T11:15:24  <roflmao> gotcha. i think
2011-11-01T11:15:36  <Fluxid> good idea, i may use it for attacking hills... so farther hills would get more chances to be attacked
2011-11-01T11:15:51  <roflmao> but if you grab lowest cost path it's errr
2011-11-01T11:15:53  <roflmao> no longer bfs?
2011-11-01T11:16:02  <roflmao> I thought bfs did no priority queue type of sorting
2011-11-01T11:16:13  <roflmao> and just picked whatever the shit it could come up with
2011-11-01T11:16:19  <thestinger> yeah, I plan on using it to prioritize hill targets, but still attack a hill with ants that are near it already
2011-11-01T11:16:47  <ikaros> roflmao, with bfs you just calculate a distance map around a target
2011-11-01T11:16:59  <ikaros> how you use the values is a different thing
2011-11-01T11:17:05  <tmc2> roflmao, you're thinking of flood fill, not BFS

2011-11-01T11:34:22  <tmc2> the way I do BFS, it's the same speed regardless of the number of goals

2011-11-01T11:35:15  <analyst74> numpy is available on the match runners?

2011-11-01T11:35:40  <tmc2> damn?
2011-11-01T11:35:44  <tmc2> oh, using python 3
2011-11-01T11:36:04  <thestinger> python2 v python3 probably isn't a huge difference since you aren't really using the standard lib or strings
2011-11-01T11:36:38  <antimatroid> thestinger: you can run a* from a food location to all ants as well
2011-11-01T11:37:08  <thestinger> so you keep going until you get to all the ants basically?
2011-11-01T11:37:34  <antimatroid> well what are you trying to find? the shortest path from an ant to the food location?

2011-11-01T11:38:02  <thestinger> BFS works well for hills/exploration, I'll see what happens with food
2011-11-01T11:38:07  <antimatroid> my beta bot found the shortest path from a food location to an unused ant location using a*
2011-11-01T11:38:25  <tmc2> or, well, slows down a lot if you have a lot of ants (probably still fast enough)

2011-11-01T12:11:28  <Minthos> in practice, not many
2011-11-01T12:11:38  <thestinger> yeah, cause if you can see them you have ants there
2011-11-01T12:11:45  <thestinger> so they should be getting eaten :)

2011-11-01T12:12:13  <pairofdice> I was thinking of doing one 'tier' or cost level at a time for each food item so you would get one map with several drains
2011-11-01T12:13:28  <pairofdice> So you would just do one map once for all foods

2011-11-01T12:21:28  <ccc> hello, my bot just played a game and it crashed in the first turn, in the first turn itself I got like 200+ walls. the turn time was 500ms. whats the trick in these kind of situations,
2011-11-01T12:21:44  <Zao> ccc: Write better algorithms.
2011-11-01T12:21:53  <Zao> Either cheaper ones, or ones amortised over several turns.
2011-11-01T12:22:14  <ccc> but i have to parse all the walls because i will miss them otherwise
2011-11-01T12:22:16  <Zao> And of course, write correct code :D
2011-11-01T12:22:21  <janzert> basically my problem isn't in/with the actual match quality formula (I haven't even looked into that, but playing with it it seems to be giving reasonable results anyway) but with how the match_quality is derived for players after the 2nd one
2011-11-01T12:22:22  <Zao> ccc: Are you referring to water?
2011-11-01T12:22:32  <ccc> yeah, water
2011-11-01T12:22:36  <Zao> ccc: Parsing shouldn't remotely be a bottleneck.
2011-11-01T12:22:54  <Hexren> are you using the tutorial bot ?
2011-11-01T12:23:00  <roflmao> nope

2011-11-01T12:24:01  <Zao> ccc: Fix your crash, then see if cost is an issue.
2011-11-01T12:24:21  <janzert> it seems to have the same result as the sql for the 2nd player so I think it is correct
2011-11-01T12:24:39  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, after the first player, it is an aproximation, it still maintains the correct order if you compare it to the actual trueskill values
2011-11-01T12:25:31  <McLeopold> it is essentially looking for the tightest clump of pair-wise match qualities it can
2011-11-01T12:26:10  <janzert> so the correct value would be taking the average mu and sigma for the current players compared to the proposed opponent
2011-11-01T12:26:12  <McLeopold> I could add the pair-wise list to the opponent sql so we could debug
2011-11-01T12:26:20  <pairofdice> "Nice try.. but the evil robot WILL get you" What!
2011-11-01T12:26:34  <McLeopold> pairofdice: sweet, you got my new message
2011-11-01T12:27:19  <janzert> how would I manually derive the value that the sql is coming up with?
2011-11-01T12:27:53  <McLeopold> pairofdice: you tried to activate or deactivate a submission without being logged in
2011-11-01T12:28:06  <McLeopold> janzert: read the sql formula?
2011-11-01T12:28:09  <janzert> by my reading I thought it was the best pair-wise match quality, but that is certainly not it
2011-11-01T12:28:17  <janzert> I tried :)
2011-11-01T12:28:26  <janzert> I can't get to the sql result
2011-11-01T12:28:37  <McLeopold> okay, inside the exp(sum(log( ))) is the pair wise formula
2011-11-01T12:29:00  <janzert> right what I pasted above in python
2011-11-01T12:29:02  <McLeopold> it's a full join from each player in the matchup to all other submissions
2011-11-01T12:29:06  <pairofdice> I tried to deactivate my ant
2011-11-01T12:29:17  <pairofdice> Untill I get it to actually do something
2011-11-01T12:29:31  <janzert> which means it calculates the match quality to each current player right?
2011-11-01T12:29:57  <McLeopold> each possible opponent gets a correct trueskill value calced with all others already in the match
2011-11-01T12:30:43  <janzert> right, I believe that's what I said unless I misunderstand what you're saying
2011-11-01T12:31:20  <McLeopold> then those correct true skill values are send through ln, then added up, the sent through exp
2011-11-01T12:31:21  <janzert> the from the order by clause I thought it would take the best of those
2011-11-01T12:31:49  <janzert> ahh, the ln and exp are aggregate functions
2011-11-01T12:31:54  <McLeopold> and sum
2011-11-01T12:32:06  <McLeopold> only sum
2011-11-01T12:32:21  <pairofdice> McLeopold, the funny thing is, I am logged in
2011-11-01T12:32:21  <McLeopold> ln should be applied to each
2011-11-01T12:32:22  <janzert> ahh, actually I was missing reading that first line
2011-11-01T12:32:26  <McLeopold> exp to the result of the sum
2011-11-01T12:33:17  <pairofdice> Okay, worked now...
2011-11-01T12:33:23  <pairofdice> So I guess I wasn't
2011-11-01T12:33:38  <janzert> ok, and the idea is that orders the same as calculating the "correct" match quality against the average mu and sigma of current players?
2011-11-01T12:33:55  <janzert> even though it isn't the same actual number
2011-11-01T12:35:09  <roflmao> Before: 9955
2011-11-01T12:35:09  <roflmao> After: 9922

2011-11-01T12:51:32  <bqf> roflmao: pretty though.

2011-11-01T12:51:51  <roflmao> all the 0's are 0's because the bfs exited prematurely

2011-11-01T12:54:38  <rickyg> ok that's what I thought too
2011-11-01T12:54:59  <thestinger> well, atm I know my hill has died if I can see the location and it's not there anymore :P
2011-11-01T12:56:11  <jnwhiteh> a1k0n: wow, three razes in quick succession!
2011-11-01T12:56:26  <Fluxid> for the first time i saw "In Game: Playing in a game right now." on aichallenge.org

2011-11-01T12:57:14  <jnwhiteh> a1k0n: yeah, but you get stuck on the right with the wraparound
2011-11-01T12:57:22  <jnwhiteh> fix that and you'll be in a very good place!
2011-11-01T12:57:35  <a1k0n> oh those ants aren't stuck, they just have nothing to do
2011-11-01T12:57:44  <jnwhiteh> then they should explore and make progress =)
2011-11-01T12:57:49  <jnwhiteh> unless they're guarding
2011-11-01T12:57:55  <jnwhiteh> hehe
2011-11-01T12:57:59  <a1k0n> i know.  my exploration is kind of nearest-ant and they're not near to anything
2011-11-01T12:58:04  <a1k0n> so yeah, they end up "guarding"
2011-11-01T12:58:08  <a1k0n> it works ok.  shrug.
2011-11-01T12:58:12  <jnwhiteh> hehe

2011-11-01T12:59:51  <jnwhiteh> wouldn't say its your fault =)

2011-11-01T13:10:00  <ikaros> cause there are just too many moves to have a proper calculation (especially in 500ms)
2011-11-01T13:10:50  <pedrosorio> you need to give your ants some ninja training before sending them into combat
2011-11-01T13:10:55  <ikaros> =)
2011-11-01T13:11:01  <pedrosorio> that's the only way to have them be effective in <500ms

2011-11-01T13:39:11  <ChrisH_> this game seems suspicious http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=44515 how often do you see two pretty good bots both timeout on the first turn?
2011-11-01T13:39:39  <McLeopold> both java...
2011-11-01T13:40:04  <ChrisH_> Relax: the visualizer isn't good at showing combat because it shows the positions of the ants the turn before they die
2011-11-01T13:40:10  <mleise> McLeopold: did you by chance change the mouse offset?
2011-11-01T13:40:26  <McLeopold> I don't even know what that is?

2011-11-01T13:41:25  <McLeopold> Relax: move your mouse over the ants, a circle should appear showing the attack range

2011-11-01T13:46:40  <mleise> I know what I will do: place 8 ants around my hills and lure enemies to it, harhar
2011-11-01T13:47:08  <Antimony> if teh enemy has enough ants, that might not work
2011-11-01T13:48:01  <mleise> Antimony: As long as they don't understand the attack rules properly and send their ants one by one, I'm safe :)
2011-11-01T13:48:18  <Antimony> yeah but that won't help once you get near the top
2011-11-01T13:48:28  <tmc2> github is oddly identical to gitorious
2011-11-01T13:48:33  <Antimony> of course I'd be happy if my bot could understand fighting tactics at all
2011-11-01T13:48:50  <Overburn> but hmm wouldn't it be smarter when you see an enemy ant too close to your hill to move the ants in a position that would favor you ?
2011-11-01T13:49:00  <mleise> you see, and this is why I could get a confortable place in the rankings with this tactic :D
2011-11-01T13:49:27  <mleise> Overburn: but that's complicated
2011-11-01T13:49:28  <McLeopold> mleise: like this? http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=42331&turn=220&row=61&col=127
2011-11-01T13:49:30  <Overburn> and instead of placing 8 around your hill, just place an adaptive percentage of your total ants around your hill so that you'd have good cover?
2011-11-01T13:49:47  <Overburn> mleise: it's an ai contest hehe
2011-11-01T13:49:49  <mleise> McLeopold: that's where I got the idea, yes :)
2011-11-01T13:50:37  <mleise> Overburn: yes, I want to show how dumb the other "A.I." are
2011-11-01T13:50:53  <mleise> by coding an even dumber one that just sits around the hill
2011-11-01T13:51:08  <mleise> but still manages to survive the others

2011-11-01T14:12:18  <Overburn> so basically

2011-11-01T14:14:14  <McLeopold> yep
2011-11-01T14:14:15  <tmc2> meaning that too much confidence was put into a player's skill score

2011-11-01T14:21:47  <McLeopold> magiik: the best way is to run a game normally with the -I option to get the input file for each bot
2011-11-01T14:22:13  <McLeopold> then run that back through your program: python -m cProfile MyBot.py < 0.bot0.input
2011-11-01T14:22:16  <magiik> ah, then i can replay it to the bot

2011-11-01T14:23:03  <tmc2> although I just realised that you can't easily reproduce your bot's state if it stops a turn early due to timeout :(
2011-11-01T14:23:33  <tmc2> well, potentially not anyway, depending on how stateful it is
2011-11-01T14:23:36  <magiik> tmc2: for that kind of testing i remove my timeouts and change turntime to really high - if you are debugging a specific problem and you want to be able to recreate it
2011-11-01T14:23:54  <tmc2> yes, but you can't do that with replays from the server
2011-11-01T14:24:05  <magiik> true
2011-11-01T14:24:17  <ccc> how is the engine calculating time, is it the real-time or the processor time used
2011-11-01T14:24:23  <tmc2> wall clock
2011-11-01T14:25:04  <Overburn> just curious, how many of you use direct ant movements and how many use order queues : D
2011-11-01T14:25:05  <FastEddie_> a webcam pointed at a wall clock
2011-11-01T14:25:13  <Overburn> trying to decide
2011-11-01T14:25:30  <Migi32> if there are 3 players, and they each have a different score, how much does TrueSkill reward the 2nd player?
2011-11-01T14:26:32  <Migi32> basically what I'm asking is: should you play risky and try to go for either 1st when you're lucky and 3rd when you're unlucky, or play safe and always get 2nd no matter what?
2011-11-01T14:27:15  <lavalamp> Migi32: I think you have to try for first, you have no way of knowing that you're currently tied with anyone...
2011-11-01T14:27:45  <Overburn> Migi32: what are you trying to achieve?
2011-11-01T14:28:31  <Overburn> i mean your problem coul also be formulated as "take a chance and maybe be first or always be second" heh
2011-11-01T14:28:32  <Overburn> : D
2011-11-01T14:29:50  <Migi32> an example in ant terms: a risky strategy would be to go on massive attacks against an enemy hill, which can end up in both you and that enemy losing a lot of ants, but you gaining 2 points, but also maybe a 3rd player can then easily kill you
2011-11-01T14:30:26  <Migi32> if your attack works and your defense holds, it can get you 1st place. If your attack or your defense fails, you get
2011-11-01T14:30:28  <Migi32> 3rd place
2011-11-01T14:30:45  <Overburn> well that can be solved with probabilities
2011-11-01T14:31:06  <Migi32> the safe strategy would be to prioritize defense over attack
2011-11-01T14:31:32  <Overburn> with the map size, explored map size , number of hills you have, number of opponents encountered, number of discovered enemy ants per opponent as factors for example
2011-11-01T14:31:37  <Overburn> and adapt your strategy based on those
2011-11-01T14:32:22  <Overburn> just cunch those numbers and generate your strategy based on the ouptup
2011-11-01T14:32:25  <Overburn> *output
2011-11-01T14:32:50  <McLeopold> Migi32: if you are under attack with a hill left, either you or someone else can gain in rank

2011-11-01T14:33:57  <Migi32> I know all that. But even if you take all those factors into account, there's still a choice left of playing risky and aggressive or safe and defensive
2011-11-01T14:34:42  <Overburn> hmm i'm not very familiar with them ,but you could take a look at decision making algorithms such as minimax

2011-11-01T14:38:35  <Overburn> but if you use probable outcomes, you just need to use the one that's more probable

2011-11-01T14:56:07  <caution> has anyone noticed the coords are backwards in the python starter kit?
2011-11-01T14:56:09  <caution> it's so annoying
2011-11-01T14:56:13  <tmc2> yes
2011-11-01T14:56:25  <tmc2> I got used to it quickly
2011-11-01T14:56:27  <caution> no plants to fix it?
2011-11-01T14:56:39  <tmc2> it's easier to write row,column instead of y,x
2011-11-01T14:56:46  <caution> that's what I did
2011-11-01T14:56:50  <emumrik> Hello everybody. I'm really sorry but I cant find out how to make orders for my bot. It's written in Pascal ( Delphi ). Can You help?
2011-11-01T14:56:54  <caution> changed all my y x to row cols
2011-11-01T14:57:00  <tmc2> normally I would use an array indexed by y,x
2011-11-01T14:57:16  <tmc2> so I'm actually pleased with the rows,columns layout
2011-11-01T14:57:23  <caution> yeah but it's not the arrays, it's the tuples
2011-11-01T14:57:34  <caution> that you would expect to be in coordinate format
2011-11-01T14:57:41  <tmc2> huh?
2011-11-01T14:57:50  <tmc2> what do you mean
2011-11-01T14:57:52  <caution> my_ant = (row, col)
2011-11-01T14:58:11  <tmc2> also, I use numpy, so I can index ants.map[ant_loc]
2011-11-01T14:58:27  <tmc2> waaaay better than ants.map[ant_loc[0]][ant_loc[1]]
2011-11-01T14:58:44  <caution> I use a class for that
2011-11-01T14:58:49  <caution> what's the numpy advantage?
2011-11-01T14:59:15  <tmc2> lots of array functions
2011-11-01T14:59:27  <emumrik> I try to output in StdOut string like "o 9 65 S
2011-11-01T14:59:31  <tmc2> faster than raw python, though I ended up using extensions anyway
2011-11-01T14:59:36  <emumrik> but it doesn't work
2011-11-01T14:59:50  <caution> how long does a player have per turn? Is there a cumulative limit for the whole game?
2011-11-01T15:00:00  <tmc2> emumrik, doesn't the starter kit contain a functino for doing that?
2011-11-01T15:00:08  <tmc2> caution, no cumulative limit
2011-11-01T15:00:12  <caution> I see turntime 	500
2011-11-01T15:00:17  <caution> is that seconds?
2011-11-01T15:00:21  <tmc2> milliseconds
2011-11-01T15:00:32  <emumrik> it does, but in such a strange way that I ha to write my own

2011-11-01T15:01:30  <tmc2> hmm, well make sure you append 'go\n' after the last order of your turn
2011-11-01T15:01:45  <emumrik> yes, I'm sure

2011-11-01T15:02:04  <tmc2> actually, I don't think they're passed to the bot anyway

2011-11-01T15:06:37  <emumrik> I'll try of course. But I've already read examples in Java and C++ but I still don't understand
2011-11-01T15:06:48  <tmc2> I believe that if you pass an invalid order, you will get a warning message. Do you?
2011-11-01T15:07:19  <tmc2> are you sure your bot didn't get kicked for some reason?
2011-11-01T15:07:56  <Minthos> emumrik: I didn't suggest you use the D package, in fact I don't suggest anyone do - but the code is easy to understand
2011-11-01T15:07:58  <emumrik> I haven't. And I've tried to send almost all coordinates.
2011-11-01T15:08:00  <tmc2> at the end of the game, it's status should be 'survived' (assuming it did) rather than 'timeout'
2011-11-01T15:08:09  <JanneP> Minthos: i started looking into the C++ starter and it also makes much more sense
2011-11-01T15:08:18  <JanneP> and there is already more stuff to start with

2011-11-01T15:31:46  <tmc2> ah, it's true
2011-11-01T15:31:52  <tmc2> hill razing happens before ant spawning
2011-11-01T15:32:08  <tmc2> (and razing happens after movement and attacking)
2011-11-01T15:33:56  <caution> HaraKiri's replay makes it look impossible

2011-11-01T15:34:51  <caution> the yellow ants completely surround his hill for several turns

2011-11-01T15:35:32  <tmc2> oh wait
2011-11-01T15:35:43  <tmc2> I changed my mind
2011-11-01T15:35:57  <tmc2> it should be impossible, because movement happens before combat
2011-11-01T15:36:04  <pairofdice> They can't because there's an ant spawning all the time
2011-11-01T15:36:28  <tmc2> so after an ant is spawned, next turn you can't move onto the hill without dying, unless the previously spawned ant moves away
2011-11-01T15:36:32  <tmc2> wait

2011-11-01T17:07:20  <ccc> in maps where we have multiple hills, the water list is huge, runs into more than 300+ for each turn, and the turntime is like 500ms. How do we even play in this kind of situations, I'm thinking to not do anything if I see huge water lists coming in (because they only appear once anyway), does this sound resonable?
2011-11-01T17:08:06  <Zao> ccc: Some bot frameworks have functions to query remaining turn time.
2011-11-01T17:08:11  <cyphase> ccc, 300 for each turn?
2011-11-01T17:08:20  <Zao> Either make your code super-awesome or amortise things across turns.
2011-11-01T17:08:39  <ccc> yeah, two of my live games timeout because I got 250-300 waters in turn 1
2011-11-01T17:08:44  <Zao> Make rough pathfinds, then refine them as needed, etc.
2011-11-01T17:09:28  <pairofdice> water doesn't move, why do you need to query it every turn?
2011-11-01T17:10:35  <ccc> I'm not query water at all, i'm just saving their coords in a hast table as i see them. my question is if i see 300+ in turn 1 then how do i not save them (they appear only once right)
2011-11-01T17:11:40  <Minthos> how do you not save them? surely just saving them doesn't take 500 ms?
2011-11-01T17:11:56  <pairofdice> No, it shouldn't...
2011-11-01T17:12:25  <pairofdice> You're doing something very wrong

2011-11-01T17:13:48  <ccc> I'm just saving all w's in hash, and some logic for a's (which is only 3 in first case)

2011-11-01T17:32:20  <tmc2> ..on linux at least
2011-11-01T17:32:33  <tmc2> on windows, my python bot always gets reported as timeout when it crashes
2011-11-01T17:32:36  <Minthos> and it's a timeout if it keeps running but doesn't end its turn within the time limit (which is 500 ms per turn)
2011-11-01T17:32:44  <dwins> doesn't it also register as a crash if you bot sends invalid commands too?
2011-11-01T17:32:48  <tmc2> I imagine it's because it's not running in a sandbox
2011-11-01T17:32:54  <dwins> like if you end up dumping a stacktrace to stdout or something
2011-11-01T17:33:03  <tmc2> yes, if the engine is set to 'strict'
2011-11-01T17:33:06  <Minthos> dwins: no, then it registers as invalid

2011-11-01T18:09:06  <Migi32> how confusing
2011-11-01T18:09:12  <pedrosorio> so that you can picture which ants are being destroyed
2011-11-01T18:09:16  <pedrosorio> when watching the replay
2011-11-01T18:09:26  <pedrosorio> but it can be a bit confusing yeah
2011-11-01T18:10:01  <Migi32> sometimes when it shows them shooting, if the ants would step in a different direction than then do the next turn, they could live
2011-11-01T18:10:23  <Migi32> than they* do

2011-11-01T18:11:33  <ccc> in the visualizer if you pause the game and step over one at a time you will notice that you need to click next two times to finish one turn, so after the half turn the elimination phase is done
2011-11-01T18:13:15  <Migi32> ah yeah, this is mostly an issue when you step one turn at a time

2011-11-01T18:28:29  <roflmao> I'm going to implement bfs (at the suggestion of people here, love you all) for exploring
2011-11-01T18:28:33  <roflmao> in fact bfs is working great
2011-11-01T18:28:43  <roflmao> however still trying to decide HOW to generate the bfs cost maps

2011-11-01T18:28:52  <roflmao> I was thinking of generating from each edge of the map to the other
2011-11-01T18:29:21  <roflmao> ergo top-left to bottom-left (and vice versa), bottom-left to bottom-right
2011-11-01T18:29:39  <roflmao> and then dividing the map into 4 quadrants (classic style)
2011-11-01T18:29:58  <roflmao> and then using the corresponding bfs map for the exploring ant based on the quadrant it is
2011-11-01T18:30:02  <pairofdice> Yeah, I'm writing my own BFS very, very slowly
2011-11-01T18:30:19  <roflmao> so if ant is in top-left quadrant (where in math x would be negative and y positive)
2011-11-01T18:30:39  <roflmao> it would use the bfs map of top-left to bottom-left or top-left to top-right
2011-11-01T18:30:45  <roflmao> and go explore away
2011-11-01T18:30:52  <pairofdice> why would you care about edges or corners?
2011-11-01T18:31:04  <roflmao> well fluxid said he used a flood to edges for exploring
2011-11-01T18:31:12  <pairofdice> hmm
2011-11-01T18:31:13  <roflmao> because it effectively sparses ants on map
2011-11-01T18:31:20  <roflmao> preventing clustering and helping keep the map visible at all times
2011-11-01T18:31:36  <tmc2> roflmao, this is BFS from every ant to nearest unseen tile?
2011-11-01T18:31:36  <roflmao> OBVIOUSLY if I see food I'll a*/bfs my way to the food using a close ant
2011-11-01T18:31:56  <roflmao> tmc2: I don't know what I'm doing tbh
2011-11-01T18:32:05  <pairofdice> I'm wondering how to deal with dead-ends

2011-11-01T18:32:12  <roflmao> tmc2: I have the BFS, just still not sure how I want to implement it for exploring
2011-11-01T18:32:17  <tmc2> you can do a BFS from every unseen tile simultaneously, across the whole map, and if you do it properly it'll be very fast
2011-11-01T18:32:33  <roflmao> every unseen tile to every ant?
2011-11-01T18:32:53  <tmc2> just initialise your queue to the unseen tiles at the perimeter
2011-11-01T18:32:53  <pairofdice> right, so instead of from the hill, do from the fog of war inside
2011-11-01T18:32:56  <tmc2> to nearest ant

2011-11-01T18:34:46  <roflmao> or just pick one?
2011-11-01T18:34:48  <roflmao> that's what I don't get
2011-11-01T18:34:52  <pairofdice> yes, but you don't recalculate the area for each perimeter square
2011-11-01T18:35:00  <pairofdice> you cycle through the perimeter
2011-11-01T18:35:12  <roflmao> reusing the data from previous bfs checks?

2011-11-01T18:45:02  <roflmao> if you start at goal
2011-11-01T18:45:04  <Minthos> yeah but if the goal is any of 50 tiles, you need to do 50 bfses
2011-11-01T18:45:08  <pedrosorio> if you do it for every ant each turn
2011-11-01T18:45:08  <pedrosorio> it probably times out

2011-11-01T18:46:05  <roflmao> for all the ants
2011-11-01T18:46:06  <roflmao> in a given turn
2011-11-01T18:46:08  <pedrosorio> the main thing is

2011-11-01T18:46:26  <pedrosorio> every time that "global" bfs finds an ant

2011-11-01T18:48:28  <roflmao> minthos: didn't get that last part
2011-11-01T18:48:28  <Minthos> and terminate when the whole map is in the closed set
2011-11-01T18:48:42  <a1k0n> pedrosorio: yeah but... i dunno, what else would you use?
2011-11-01T18:48:45  <Minthos> bfs normally has one starting point
2011-11-01T18:48:49  <Minthos> but it doesn't have to
2011-11-01T18:48:52  <Minthos> it can have many
2011-11-01T18:48:56  <roflmao> don't they conflict?
2011-11-01T18:48:58  <a1k0n> pedrosorio: i've won games where i was eliminated just cuz i had the most kills.  shrug, that's what i optimize for
2011-11-01T18:49:04  <Pisarik> Hi to all
2011-11-01T18:49:09  <Minthos> not if you make sure they don't
2011-11-01T18:49:24  <Minthos> how you do it and whether it makes sense depends what you need
2011-11-01T18:49:24  <pedrosorio> a1k0n: for example, bots that time out, or bots that have the same hills but one of them is clearly dominating
2011-11-01T18:49:46  <Pisarik> can anybody help me?

2011-11-01T18:51:48  <Minthos> wait, never mind..
2011-11-01T18:51:52  <pedrosorio> Minthos: but then you need to do it independently for each ant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2011-11-01T18:52:09  <pedrosorio> with bfs
2011-11-01T18:52:15  <roflmao> yeah because if you explore outwards FROM the ant
2011-11-01T18:52:22  <Minthos> you can place all the unexplored nodes in the open set at the beginning

2011-11-01T18:55:26  <roflmao> no;....
2011-11-01T18:55:47  <Minthos> each tile gets a path to its nearest unexplored tile

2011-11-01T18:56:08  <Minthos> there's no room for confusion as long as you never revisit an already visited tile

2011-11-01T18:56:27  <Pisarik> One moment:)

2011-11-01T19:16:52  <Minthos> food isn't supposed to be a list of ints I think
2011-11-01T19:17:23  <Minthos> a list of locations is more reasonable
2011-11-01T19:17:30  <pedrosorio_> well
2011-11-01T19:17:34  <Minthos> but if the list is empty, what happens?
2011-11-01T19:17:35  <pedrosorio_> hjax_ a location can't be an int
2011-11-01T19:17:36  <hjax_> wihch is why i turned it into a single int bestfood[0]
2011-11-01T19:17:39  <pedrosorio_> that's all it's saying
2011-11-01T19:17:51  <hjax_> is the food = the location?
2011-11-01T19:18:01  <ChrisH_> janzert: I just noticed that other than the first game, that submission crashed in all the other games and has made it all the way to rank 498 solely by luck of scheduling.
2011-11-01T19:18:30  <Minthos> some type checking would make sense at this point :p

2011-11-01T19:57:26  <roflmao> once path was completed, that food was finished off so I could remove it from the food array
2011-11-01T19:57:44  <ikaros> i calculate the bfs for single targets with different radii and cache them.. its fast enoug too so far :))
2011-11-01T19:58:19  <bluegaspode_> when you run BFS from all food tiles - what about two ants near food tile #1 ... they both would run for #2 (as it's their nearest food tile) while it would be better if ant #1 runs for food #1 and ant #2 runs for food #2?
2011-11-01T19:58:49  <bluegaspode_> sorry - typo: both would run for #1
2011-11-01T19:58:52  <ikaros> you can loop over all food and check every neighbor tile for an own ant at the beginning of every round

2011-11-01T20:51:39  <ikaros> hm
2011-11-01T20:51:45  <ikaros> dont understand why :)
2011-11-01T20:51:54  <roflmao> i thought bfs doesn't give the most optimal path necessarily
2011-11-01T20:52:00  <burny> shouldn't all proper methods, give the exact same path?
2011-11-01T20:52:01  <pairofdice> it does
2011-11-01T20:52:10  <SharkMonkey> Are many people here doing that stanford ai class?
2011-11-01T20:52:12  <ikaros> shortest route :)
2011-11-01T20:52:29  <pairofdice> SharkMonkey, I am
2011-11-01T20:52:39  <roflmao> okay
2011-11-01T20:52:53  <burny> more accurately.. a* doesn't neccessarly give shortest path.. if your estimated costs are bad
2011-11-01T20:53:38  <SharkMonkey> pairofdice, Have you used anything from it? Aside from that first unit on graph search algorithms

2011-11-01T21:02:03  <pedrosorio_> just read through
2011-11-01T21:02:13  <pedrosorio_> on the strategies there's nothing too interesting
2011-11-01T21:02:18  <pedrosorio_> you can learn a lot more here
2011-11-01T21:02:37  <pedrosorio_> but on the tools some interesting stuff can appear at any time
2011-11-01T21:02:51  <magiik> pairofdice: you could use copy.copy or copy.deepcopy ?
2011-11-01T21:03:12  <magiik> or if by set you meant dict, you could use dict.copy()
2011-11-01T21:05:38  <pairofdice> set is a dict without values
2011-11-01T21:06:07  <pairofdice> Well, atleast I got to turn 17 now :)

2011-11-01T21:22:22  <grom358> so.. swapping to use BFS for general movement... still can't figure out how to deal with exploring
2011-11-01T21:23:41  <burny> give every square a weighting of importance(eg how you decide to attack, or get food)
2011-11-01T21:23:52  <burny> and give undiscovered squares a low weighting
2011-11-01T21:23:54  <grom358> like which unseen tiles todo the BFS from
2011-11-01T21:24:49  <grom358> burny: yeah I already got it so I can do a weighting.. I got a findAnts(Tile startTile, int incValue, int limitValue, int noAnts)
2011-11-01T21:25:12  <grom358> so I can pass in different incValue
2011-11-01T21:25:38  <grom358> which is what it increases the score by as I expand the search

2011-11-01T21:26:40  <BrocksBrain> Hello all, I was wondering if anyone here is familiar with getting the tools running on Windows 64?  I can run the script, but the visualizer doesn't work for me.
2011-11-01T21:26:40  <magiik> to incrementing by X AND use other heurestics
2011-11-01T21:26:54  <magiik> like if a tile is unseen, then increment by less, etc
2011-11-01T21:27:00  <burny> ie. distance shouldn't be only factor, in deciding what to do
2011-11-01T21:27:29  <grom358> yeah.. but how do I pick which unseen tiles todo a BFS from?
2011-11-01T21:27:46  <magiik> he didn't really touch on that
2011-11-01T21:27:49  <magiik> choose any unseen tile
2011-11-01T21:27:57  <magiik> then if unseen tiles get a smaller score
2011-11-01T21:28:03  <magiik> then your ants will prefer to take unseen paths
2011-11-01T21:29:13  <grom358> mmm.. I actually recording when I last saw a tile.. was hoping could make ants prefer paths it hasn't taken recently.. and then unseen just special case of that
2011-11-01T21:29:36  <magiik> it's all the same then
2011-11-01T21:29:41  <magiik> change what i said about unseen
2011-11-01T21:29:47  <magiik> and substitute your heurestic
2011-11-01T21:30:10  <magiik> the important thing is to change how the scoring takes place
2011-11-01T21:30:14  <magiik> to change the outcome of the BFS
2011-11-01T21:30:25  <magiik> with just distance for scoring, you get shortest path
2011-11-01T21:30:31  <burny> don't forget to take symmetry into account, and the food spawn pattern, after it's known

2011-11-01T21:31:54  <burny> and also unseen foods
2011-11-01T21:32:02  <magiik> and how exactly does the food spawn pattern work?
2011-11-01T21:32:06  <burny> and proable locations for enemy ants
2011-11-01T21:32:16  <magiik> ah i c i c
2011-11-01T21:32:19  <magiik> interesting
2011-11-01T21:32:20  <burny> it's detailed in the specs
2011-11-01T21:32:50  <magiik> ah k thx
2011-11-01T21:33:19  <burny> food spawn pattern is probably the hardest thing to take advantage of
2011-11-01T21:33:46  * antimatroid isn't a huge fan of the ant spawnign method
2011-11-01T21:34:03  <antimatroid> i'd much rather be told how many ants we have in our hive and execute orders to spawn them
2011-11-01T21:34:21  <burny> this method is more fair though
2011-11-01T21:34:27  <antimatroid> how?
2011-11-01T21:34:46  <antimatroid> if anything it's less fair because the randomness could potentially be unfair
2011-11-01T21:34:53  <burny> if you want to control how they spawn, you have to use some of your army non-optimally
2011-11-01T21:34:57  <antimatroid> where as if users are choosing their own spawn locations it's got to be fair
2011-11-01T21:35:05  <burny> it's not random
2011-11-01T21:35:08  <antimatroid> if you have ants near all hills, enemies might ruin that
2011-11-01T21:35:09  <grom358> mmm.. just thought of something.. not sure if it will be fast enough to calculate. Get set of all tiles.. order them by scoring the tiles which results in seeing the most number of tiles. Pop them off the list removing tiles in view radius from the set of all tiles. Left with just a handful of tiles that cover the map
2011-11-01T21:35:17  <antimatroid> you might not even know if all your hills are still alive
2011-11-01T21:35:26  <antimatroid> it is random if there's a tie
2011-11-01T21:35:40  <burny> don't let there be a tie then
2011-11-01T21:35:55  <antimatroid> you're being unreasonable now :P
2011-11-01T21:36:24  <burny> unless you stand on your own hill: it's only random for the first ants(and all players get the same random.. I hope)
2011-11-01T21:36:45  <antimatroid> not if you collect multiple food locations that turn

2011-11-01T21:37:02  <antimatroid> and there's more hills to spawn at on the tie than ants to spawn
2011-11-01T21:37:27  <antimatroid> it makes it almost impossible to use future spawning ants for food collection etc.
2011-11-01T21:37:39  <antimatroid> and also means paths already calculated might become suboptimal as ants spawn
2011-11-01T21:37:45  <antimatroid> imo it's very unideal, but it's how they did it
2011-11-01T21:38:04  <burny> I agree, it's unideal..
2011-11-01T21:38:13  <antimatroid> i'd have preferred closest hill even, although that can have ties too
2011-11-01T21:38:17  <burny> but it does make a larger seperation between uber bots, and strong bots..
2011-11-01T21:38:30  <bmh> a1k0n: I've been trying to grind out 'static' pathfinding and wanted some advice on my subdivision algorithm

2011-11-01T21:39:00  <antimatroid> bmh: where ants are going to spawn
2011-11-01T21:39:04  <bmh> right
2011-11-01T21:40:34  <antimatroid> burny: the difference comes from it being that much harder to make use of future ants, and i don't like something being harder just cause that's how things were done and not because the problem is inherently any harder

2011-11-01T21:42:13  <willrandship> anyone want to answer a question?
2011-11-01T21:42:45  <bmh> is it that hard to park some 'cork' ants near hills and then just check each hill to see how an ant from each would match up against your current set of goals?

2011-11-01T21:44:03  <burny> right
2011-11-01T21:44:24  <antimatroid> however controlling where ants spawn is very useful
2011-11-01T21:44:33  <antimatroid> particularly if you need support to defend a hill now or something
2011-11-01T21:44:36  <burny> can be
2011-11-01T21:44:47  <antimatroid> and you need ants near all hills in order to ensure you can do that
2011-11-01T21:44:55  <uriahb> qq, i have an account, haven't submitted a bot. a friend and i would like to create an account, how do i cancel my current account?
2011-11-01T21:44:57  <bmh> how does it currently work? round robin?
2011-11-01T21:44:57  <willrandship> wouldn't 't generally be better to just have more ants out there?
2011-11-01T21:45:11  <antimatroid> round robin would be impossible and incredibly inefficient anyway
2011-11-01T21:45:39  <antimatroid> uriahb: just make a new account and don't submit anything to the old one
2011-11-01T21:45:42  <bmh> willrandship: no. Imagine you have a goal at some point P and two hills A and B -- A is 5 units from P and B is 10 units from P
2011-11-01T21:46:00  <antimatroid> (and double check there isn't an active submission on the old one)
2011-11-01T21:46:19  <willrandship> yes, but if the ants are after multiple goals (which they are) then they should want to spawn as fast as possible
2011-11-01T21:46:27  <antimatroid> willrandship: what if you could save one of your hills by controlling where an ant spawned?
2011-11-01T21:46:30  <willrandship> and sacrifice distance
2011-11-01T21:46:54  <antimatroid> or could collect some food faster by spawning an ant at a particular hill
2011-11-01T21:47:07  <willrandship> Ideally you should have ants spawning so much that they are always near your hills
2011-11-01T21:47:09  <antimatroid> or any other objective that might be better achieved by choosing where the ant spawned
2011-11-01T21:47:16  <antimatroid> ideally but not necessarily
2011-11-01T21:47:29  <pairofdice> Atleast I'm getting a traceback
2011-11-01T21:47:37  <willrandship> from the games I've watched, generally there's tons of food
2011-11-01T21:47:47  <willrandship> so you do get a traceback? That's good to know

2011-11-01T21:47:52  <bmh> willrandship: let's consider an extreme case. Imagine you have 1000 hills. 999 of them are in a clump that's defended to the teeth. The last hill is isolated and will be overrun. If you fail to save that one hill, you will lose.

2011-11-01T21:49:20  <willrandship> okay
2011-11-01T21:49:28  <willrandship> so we disagree on the AI handling method
2011-11-01T21:49:31  <burny> ai should handle all cases
2011-11-01T21:49:34  <willrandship> I can live with that
2011-11-01T21:49:49  <avdg> well, it depends on the goal
2011-11-01T21:49:52  <Antimony> it's not feasible to handle all cases optimally
2011-11-01T21:49:53  <willrandship> anyd all cases is impossible
2011-11-01T21:50:02  <antimatroid> not all cases, but i think what differentiates the quality of bots is how many cases they correctly handle with their general strategy
2011-11-01T21:50:03  <Antimony> you have to tune your ai for the cases that are most likely

2011-11-01T21:51:38  <Antimony> It's possible to block off the map using invincible formations

2011-11-01T22:03:04  <burny> personally, I wish there was multiple types of units
2011-11-01T22:03:32  <burny> with slightly different attributes, and food costs.. and when you get a food, it gives 1 food to all hills

2011-11-01T22:45:35  <avdg> mass simulate it locally and add many debug messages to locate the position ;-)
2011-11-01T22:46:02  <avdg> at least, thats how I fixed mine

2011-11-01T22:51:01  <roflmao> hm
2011-11-01T22:51:17  <janzert> ChrisH_: yeah, it's a rather good example of why too broadly inclusive of pairing can be actively harmful
2011-11-01T22:51:47  <ChrisH_> janzert: yeah, I thought you would find it interesting
2011-11-01T22:52:09  <janzert> he'll get beat back down of course but it could take a long time unless he happens to be paired with and lose to a much lower ranked bot
2011-11-01T22:52:56  <janzert> tying with the 11th rank is usually a good indicator for good performance, so can't really fault the ranking system there
2011-11-01T22:53:56  <ChrisH_> well, here's the thing, we both got schooled in that match, so we should learn that xathis is better than both of us, but it doesn't really measure us relative to each other
2011-11-01T22:54:00  <janzert> and then the next game tying against the 6th rank

2011-11-01T22:55:05  <janzert> the only information the ranking system sees/uses is the order of placing in the results of course

2011-11-01T22:55:49  <Antimony> avdg: I tried that, but it doesn't happen consistantly
2011-11-01T22:55:54  <Antimony> so it's impossible to debug

2011-11-01T22:56:13  <janzert> he was really quite lucky all around, as it also happened on the second game, so sigma was quite high still as well
2011-11-01T22:56:13  <avdg> try to keep it on a single one
2011-11-01T22:56:19  <Antimony> ?
2011-11-01T22:56:27  <Antimony> the timeouts are random and don't happen every game
2011-11-01T22:56:48  <avdg> try to check every loop
2011-11-01T22:57:29  <Antimony> if there were an infinite loop, then it would happen in the same place every time
2011-11-01T22:57:33  <ChrisH_> I've developed a couple ranking systems, they aren't appropriate for this kind of game, but I know the challenges involved, but in reality, looking at his history the best bot he's beaten is #2720, so the uncertainty of his rank should still be very high
2011-11-01T22:58:08  <avdg> yeah, unless you have multiple loops doing the same infinitive thingy
2011-11-01T22:58:43  <yoden> The channel might enjoy this:

2011-11-01T22:58:53  <Antimony> I'm pretty sure I don't have any infinite loops
2011-11-01T22:59:13  <antimatroid> milo is amazing
2011-11-01T22:59:19  <Antimony> anyway, the timing isn't consistant

2011-11-01T23:05:30  <ChrisH_> janzert: BTW, it would seem you were right about the game rate, at least in the top 100.  Now that a few more top bots have activated their submissions the rates have gone back up to "normal",  I think the jury is still out about it reducing the rates of deactivated accounts in general, though. Have you seen evidence in the system one way or the other?
2011-11-01T23:05:53  <janzert> so far I don't think it is
2011-11-01T23:06:18  <janzert> keep getting distracted when trying to really look into it though :)

2011-11-01T23:10:02  <janzert> ChrisH_: yeah, the largest effect will be toward the middle of the group
2011-11-01T23:10:53  <ChrisH_> I did see some game rate = 0 bots near the bottom of the standings, so clearly it is having *some* effect, but it is hard to quantify how much.

2011-11-01T23:21:32  <janzert> it'll be less work to just update them actually
2011-11-01T23:21:41  <paulwal> ok
2011-11-01T23:22:04  <janzert> one thing is there already is a /usr/bin/tclsh
2011-11-01T23:22:10  <janzert> it's just 8.4
2011-11-01T23:22:32  <paulwal> yeah that command would overwrite /usr/bin/tclsh to make it point to tclsh8.5
2011-11-01T23:22:37  <scribble> Anyone building their bot in c++ that could give me a little help?
2011-11-01T23:22:43  <paulwal> instead of pointing to tclsh8.4

2011-11-01T23:23:02  <janzert> ahh, didn't check close enough to see that it was a link as well
2011-11-01T23:23:17  <paulwal> Tcl is big on backwards-compatibility, so 8.5 won't break anything that runs on 8.4 code
2011-11-01T23:24:10  <paulwal> I investigated a little via stderr ;)

2011-11-01T23:25:55  <paulwal> dunno why the package installation doesn't overwrite the tclsh symlink by default...
2011-11-01T23:26:49  <janzert> probably the system tcl is "defined" to be 8.4
2011-11-01T23:27:06  <janzert> so the user has to be explicit in using anything else

2011-11-01T23:27:43  <McLeopold> janzert: want to freeze the game parameters?
2011-11-01T23:28:03  <ChrisH_> janzert: on a cursory scan it looks like, yes, game rates are predominately in the 6-7 range for pages 1-31, so about the bottom 25% of the standings are getting some impact, but also the bottom 15% is all new submissions less than 3 days old, so it is really only the 10% between the two that is forgoing resources, and only to a moderate degree, so it would seem the change is currently reclaiming game time from less than 5% of th
2011-11-01T23:28:12  <ChrisH_> janzert: I don't think the global impact is very big yet.
2011-11-01T23:28:29  <janzert> McLeopold: officially saying they are frozen is too strong I believe

2011-11-01T23:29:01  <janzert> officially saying they are quite unlikely to change and only in the event of problems being found with the current set, would be fine I think

2011-11-01T23:30:17  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: trueskill isn't causing the starter bots to be ranked low enough :(
2011-11-01T23:30:27  <McLeopold> otherwise the impact would be larger
2011-11-01T23:30:43  <janzert> basically we do not plan on changing them, but if we do and your bot breaks because of it it will not be our fault :/
2011-11-01T23:30:46  <ChrisH_> what percentage of the bot population is starter bots do you think?
2011-11-01T23:30:54  <McLeopold> 50%
2011-11-01T23:31:33  <ChrisH_> any ranking system that just goes off head to head results will have trouble with a high population of similarly skilled players and they will gravitate towards the middle of the ranks
2011-11-01T23:31:34  <paulwal> the better the bot performs, the more game slots it should get
2011-11-01T23:31:37  <paulwal> imo
2011-11-01T23:32:09  <janzert> paulwal: that would be a pretty strong disincentive to new programmers

2011-11-01T23:32:23  <janzert> which is a big target for the competition
2011-11-01T23:32:24  <McLeopold> paulwal: shouldn't you be rewritting our game rules to be more concise?
2011-11-01T23:32:31  <paulwal> lol
2011-11-01T23:32:34  <ChrisH_> I think starter bots come it around skill 42, which I agree is very high, but that is right at the median of the skill range right now, so not surprising
2011-11-01T23:32:36  <paulwal> ok, i will
2011-11-01T23:33:03  <paulwal> janzert, I will amend that to say that newer bots should get more game slots too
2011-11-01T23:33:47  <janzert> then we're already fulfilling your wishes, just in a mild mannered way ;)
2011-11-01T23:33:48  <ChrisH_> paulwal: that creates an incentive to constantly resubmit bot code
2011-11-01T23:34:09  <ChrisH_> so it needs to be tempered
2011-11-01T23:34:12  <paulwal> ChrisH_, only if you're improving it
2011-11-01T23:34:23  <ChrisH_> no, just to get the thrill of the game
2011-11-01T23:34:25  <paulwal> your rank gets reset with each submmission i believe
2011-11-01T23:34:44  <ChrisH_> yes
2011-11-01T23:35:37  <McLeopold> amstan: are you here?
2011-11-01T23:38:34  <paulwal> McLeopold, my initial forum post was a bit harsh and hasty.  The fact is that it's somewhat of a complex game, so it can be hard to understand, much less explain.
2011-11-01T23:40:33  <paulwal> McLeopold, do y'all have a donation paypal account setup yet?
2011-11-01T23:40:34  <ChrisH_> I think the common thread of complaints about the game spec is that there isn't a concise explanation about how the game of ants is played separate from the technical aspects of how the bots interact with the game. I think people are expecting a concise set of game rules like you would get with a board game.
2011-11-01T23:40:42  <McLeopold> it takes awhile to explain, I did add some hill razing bits and copied the attack code into the main game spec
2011-11-01T23:41:17  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: you mean without the bot i/o getting in the way?
2011-11-01T23:41:22  <ChrisH_> yes
2011-11-01T23:41:44  <janzert> yeah, a big problem is the spec trying to be both an explanation and a spec
2011-11-01T23:42:05  <McLeopold> I think you are right, it does need to be split
2011-11-01T23:42:29  <ChrisH_> something like, here is the goal of the game, here is how ants move, here is how food is collected, here is how ants fight.   And now that you know how the game works, here is how your code makes those things happen in the game.
2011-11-01T23:42:29  <paulwal> for sure
2011-11-01T23:43:14  <ChrisH_> a lot of people ask questions about how the game works before they ask how to code it
2011-11-01T23:43:36  <ChrisH_> so explain it like you were playing it by hand first
2011-11-01T23:44:30  <McLeopold> both problem description and game spec mix the game and the programming together

2011-11-01T23:46:16  <paulwal> one thing I remember being confused about was hill razing. What is razing? Do i issue a command to raze a hill?  Do I need multiple ants to raze a hill? No, I just walk move one ant on to it. Then that's more complicated by whether or not there are food stores saved up by the owner of that hill.

2011-11-01T23:47:36  <McLeopold> capa: this is a common problem.  try adding some logging to stderr, and make sure to flush, then you may see how far your bot is getting
2011-11-01T23:47:40  <capa> McLeopold: it compiled but failed in the test
2011-11-01T23:47:56  <McLeopold> so far, everyone who has found this to be an issue found something wrong with their code
2011-11-01T23:48:54  <pairofdice> Have you tried it locally on other maps
2011-11-01T23:49:07  <capa> pairofdice: no
2011-11-01T23:49:59  <McLeopold> capa: did you submit the c starter for your first bot?
2011-11-01T23:50:44  <capa> yes
2011-11-01T23:51:00  <McLeopold> it looks like the c starter has a bug that prevents map wrapping correctly
2011-11-01T23:51:07  <capa> McLeopold: then I did some improvement and re-submit it

2011-11-01T23:57:29  <paulwal> is there a way to donate to the site yet to get more servers up and running? I can write the webpage with a little graph that shows paypal donations in real time. I remember someone saying something about taxes... You can pay for the servers straight from paypal so the money never touches any banks, so there won't be any tax issues.

2011-11-01T23:58:38  <capa> McLeopold: how can i add some logging ?
2011-11-01T23:58:47  <McLeopold> write to stderr
2011-11-01T23:58:48  <ccc_> McLeopold: what are the circumstances in which a bot is considered a crash and not a timeout ? any clues will help me
2011-11-01T23:59:05  <amstan> ccc_: when you pass the time limit it's a timeout
2011-11-01T23:59:18  <McLeopold> when the process stops responding before the timeout period expires, hence the process is no more
2011-11-01T23:59:28  <amstan> McLeopold: what's up?
2011-11-01T23:59:35  <paulwal> fprintf(STDERR, "hello");
2011-11-01T23:59:38  <janzert> McLeopold: not stops responding, is no longer running
