2012-08-18T12:14:34  <antimatroid> can't be fucked
2012-08-18T12:15:51  <mcstar> wtf you are not making much more sense to me than yesterday
2012-08-18T12:15:56  <mcstar> whatever
2012-08-18T12:16:11  <antimatroid> cbf  == can't be fucked
2012-08-18T12:16:32  <mcstar> yeah i get that
2012-08-18T12:16:39  <mcstar> but it doesnt make sense
2012-08-18T12:16:42  <antimatroid> then i made sense
2012-08-18T12:16:45  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-18T12:16:46  <antimatroid> i answered your question :P
2012-08-18T12:17:18  <antimatroid> i speak lazy english
2012-08-18T12:17:26  <antimatroid> it gets lazier the later it is
2012-08-18T12:17:41  <mcstar> i see
2012-08-18T12:17:59  <antimatroid> a kid died here on a bmx yesterday
2012-08-18T12:18:13  <antimatroid> http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/08/19/354711_tasmania-news.html
2012-08-18T12:18:18  <antimatroid> my friend drove past
2012-08-18T12:18:29  <antimatroid> after, was pretty sure someone had died
2012-08-18T12:20:09  <mcstar> "but all the stakeholders that have been involved"
2012-08-18T12:20:18  <mcstar> hm, was it a private road?
2012-08-18T12:21:10  <mcstar> it weird that stakeholders were involved
2012-08-18T12:21:12  <mcstar> is*
2012-08-18T12:22:04  <mcstar> whats a 'ute'?
2012-08-18T12:23:10  <mcstar> Unit Test Equipment
2012-08-18T12:23:13  <mcstar> doesnt fit..
2012-08-18T12:23:29  <mcstar> Untie the Elderly
2012-08-18T12:23:41  <mcstar> no, how could that be south-bound
2012-08-18T12:24:00  <mcstar> Unmanned Threat Emitter
2012-08-18T12:24:31  <mcstar> actually this one fits
2012-08-18T12:24:42  <mcstar> not the unmanned part though
2012-08-18T12:25:05  <mcstar> but the thing that hit the kid could be characterized as a threat emitter
2012-08-18T12:26:39  <pairofdice> Wouldn't it be written UTE and not ute
2012-08-18T12:28:16  <mcstar> i think it is part of their language, thats why the lower case letters
2012-08-18T12:39:00  <mcstar> 200
2012-08-18T12:40:21  <antimatroid> mcstar: a ute is a car with a tray at the back
2012-08-18T12:40:46  <mcstar> like a pick-up
2012-08-18T12:40:49  <mcstar> ?
2012-08-18T12:40:52  <mcstar> or a trailer?
2012-08-18T12:40:54  <antimatroid> http://www.themotorreport.com.au/content/image/2/0/2010_holden_ssv_special_edition_ute_035-4c3fdc7c8807d.jpg
2012-08-18T12:41:04  <antimatroid> they're called utes in australia
2012-08-18T12:41:37  <mcstar> seen them, never knew what they were called
2012-08-18T12:42:04  <antimatroid> they aren't popular where you live?
2012-08-18T12:42:06  <mcstar> thats a sedan-made-pick-up
2012-08-18T12:42:08  <antimatroid> they're all over the place here
2012-08-18T12:42:11  <mcstar> no
2012-08-18T12:42:18  <antimatroid> tradies love them
2012-08-18T12:42:27  <antimatroid> for obvious reasons
2012-08-18T12:42:55  <mcstar> most of them have closed rack-space(?) here
2012-08-18T12:42:56  <antimatroid> you're right about stakeholder, that word is used incorrectly
2012-08-18T12:43:04  <mcstar> and they arent made from sedans
2012-08-18T12:43:11  <antimatroid> example picture?
2012-08-18T12:43:39  <mcstar> antimatroid: i mean, they look like vans
2012-08-18T12:43:41  <mcstar> they are
2012-08-18T12:43:43  <mcstar> mostly
2012-08-18T12:43:52  <antimatroid> vans suck
2012-08-18T12:43:53  <mcstar> and there are 4wd pick-ups
2012-08-18T12:43:57  <antimatroid> well, they have their purpose
2012-08-18T12:44:07  <antimatroid> but utes are tough
2012-08-18T12:44:25  <mcstar> antimatroid: what do americans call it?
2012-08-18T12:44:29  <antimatroid> no idea
2012-08-18T12:44:42  <antimatroid> til ute isn't a common word to everyone else
2012-08-18T12:44:55  <mcstar> ah i see
2012-08-18T12:44:58  <mcstar> it comes from utility
2012-08-18T12:47:35  <mcstar> antimatroid: im not sure whether you want to hear the other 4 problems or not
2012-08-18T12:47:47  <antimatroid> not at 2:46am :)
2012-08-18T12:48:03  <mcstar> oh, i forget the time diff
2012-08-18T12:48:13  <mcstar> 2 of them are actually interesting

2012-08-18T13:22:20  <mcstar> thestinger: lol, i extended an instantiated class with a member function!
2012-08-18T13:22:25  <mcstar> in python
2012-08-18T13:23:37  <mcstar> though, python wouldnt fill in the first argument for the class method with the object reference
2012-08-18T13:24:02  <mcstar> 2.7, im not sure about 3
2012-08-18T13:25:01  <thestinger> mcstar: you can add new methods
2012-08-18T13:25:16  <mcstar> yeah?
2012-08-18T13:26:09  <thestinger> trying to remember, sec
2012-08-18T13:27:18  <thestinger> mcstar: http://sprunge.us/eaeT
2012-08-18T13:28:41  <mcstar> a.foo = MethodType(lambda self: print(self.x), a)
2012-08-18T13:28:43  <mcstar> hm
2012-08-18T13:28:59  <mcstar> so MethodType needs 'a' to set 'a.foo'
2012-08-18T13:29:47  <thestinger> yep
2012-08-18T13:29:53  <thestinger> methods are a different type than functions
2012-08-18T13:29:59  <thestinger> pretty sure they just wrap functions though
2012-08-18T13:29:59  <mcstar> <bound method ?.<lambda> of <__main__.A
2012-08-18T13:30:55  <mcstar> ok, thanks
2012-08-18T13:31:03  <thestinger> mcstar: you can also add them to the class after defining it
2012-08-18T13:31:06  <thestinger> I think that's the main use case
2012-08-18T13:31:17  <thestinger> (rather than to instantiations of the class)
2012-08-18T13:31:38  <mcstar> class A: pass
2012-08-18T13:31:43  <mcstar> class A(A): pass
2012-08-18T13:31:46  <mcstar> ?
2012-08-18T13:31:54  <mcstar> subclussing wold do that wont it?
2012-08-18T13:31:57  <mcstar> a*
2012-08-18T13:32:43  <thestinger> hmm
2012-08-18T13:33:02  <thestinger> it actually doesn't really work
2012-08-18T13:33:14  <thestinger> because you're passing in the class (not the instance) as self
2012-08-18T13:33:24  <thestinger> so it's like a classmethod
2012-08-18T13:34:10  <thestinger> mcstar: http://sprunge.us/FgBc it adds it to existing objects
2012-08-18T13:34:12  <mcstar> what you said works with simple subclassing
2012-08-18T13:34:13  <thestinger> since they dispatch to it
2012-08-18T13:35:02  <thestinger> pretty sure there's a sane way to do that though...
2012-08-18T13:35:11  <thestinger> that doesn't let you make instance methods
2012-08-18T13:35:25  <mcstar> thestinger: i lost you, what are you trying to do now?
2012-08-18T13:35:46  <thestinger> add an instance method to all existing instantiated objects of a class
2012-08-18T13:35:50  <thestinger> I know how to add a class method
2012-08-18T13:35:55  <mcstar> aha
2012-08-18T13:35:57  <thestinger> (like that, but passing A instead of 5)
2012-08-18T13:36:14  <mcstar> extend all the instances of a class that are in memory
2012-08-18T13:36:46  <mcstar> CL can do that
2012-08-18T13:36:49  <mcstar> easily
2012-08-18T13:48:11  <thestinger> mcstar: oh
2012-08-18T13:48:14  <thestinger> there's an optional param
2012-08-18T13:48:50  <mcstar> actually i saw that
2012-08-18T13:48:57  <mcstar> im in ipython
2012-08-18T13:49:04  <mcstar> when you reac ( it displays the docstring
2012-08-18T13:49:10  <mcstar> reach*
2012-08-18T13:50:10  <thestinger> actually only has 3 args in python2
2012-08-18T13:50:40  <thestinger> ah!
2012-08-18T13:51:11  <mcstar> yeah 3
2012-08-18T13:51:20  <mcstar> function, instance, class
2012-08-18T13:51:27  <thestinger> so you pass None as the instance
2012-08-18T13:51:31  <thestinger> but it doesn't seem to work in py3
2012-08-18T13:51:52  <thestinger> oh
2012-08-18T13:51:57  <thestinger> python3 has no bound and unbound methods
2012-08-18T13:51:59  <mcstar> thestinger: do you know whats the way to force-reimport somethign?
2012-08-18T13:51:59  <thestinger> that's why
2012-08-18T13:52:12  <thestinger> mcstar: __import__
2012-08-18T13:52:24  <mcstar> thats the syntax?
2012-08-18T13:52:33  <thestinger> I think
2012-08-18T13:52:37  <thestinger> it's a function
2012-08-18T13:53:05  <thestinger> mcstar: oh nvm you don't need that low-level hackery
2012-08-18T13:53:50  <thestinger> mcstar: theres reload() or imp.reload() in py3
2012-08-18T13:54:05  <thestinger> I once used it for plugins
2012-08-18T13:54:08  <thestinger> for a little irc bot thing
2012-08-18T13:55:24  <mcstar> thestinger: hm, i dont think i can reimport like this: from some import *
2012-08-18T13:55:42  <mcstar> reload needs the module, and that means import some
