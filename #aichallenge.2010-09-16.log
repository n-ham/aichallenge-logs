2010-09-16T00:22:26  <sigh> yup, in the unmodified code only the number of ships was used
2010-09-16T00:23:57  <shades> number of ships / (1+p.GrowthRate())
2010-09-16T00:24:16  <shades> what kind of values are we seeing for GrowthRate?

2010-09-16T00:25:22  <Queue29> the 0's were kind of a surprise

2010-09-16T00:28:31  <greghaynes> amstan_: We have that, its called vpn
2010-09-16T00:28:35  <amstan_> greghaynes: read some about it, forward it to the person which needs to look into it, it seems like your club is more involved
2010-09-16T00:28:44  <amstan_> greghaynes: no... this is for wifi access
2010-09-16T00:29:10  <amstan_> greghaynes: for example.. i can go to europe now, to an univ that also supports this, and login to wpa as amstan@uwaterloo.ca and my normal pass
2010-09-16T00:29:30  <greghaynes> Ah, we wouldnt allow that
2010-09-16T00:29:50  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2010-09-16T00:30:26  <greghaynes> We have a very large pipe so someone wanting to be malicious could take advantege
2010-09-16T00:31:00  <amstan> greghaynes: it's something very official and organized, and seems very beneficial
2010-09-16T00:32:27  <hornairs> hey guys any tips on how to programattically capture the output of playgame before all the moves are piped out?
2010-09-16T00:32:33  *** smhanov_ <smhanov_!~smhanov@76-10-154-53.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-16T00:32:46  <amstan> hornairs: if you're using windows
2010-09-16T00:32:48  <hornairs> ie the stuff that showgame doesn't need, the turns and the winer?
2010-09-16T00:32:53  <amstan> wrap your command in this:
2010-09-16T00:33:04  <hornairs> *nix sorry
2010-09-16T00:33:17  <amstan> tee input.log|yourbotcommand|tee output.log
2010-09-16T00:33:46  <amstan> it will dump everything that your bot receives to one file and dump everything outgoing to another
2010-09-16T00:34:07  <hornairs> amstan sorry not the messages going to the bot, the messages coming from playgame.jar
2010-09-16T00:34:19  <amstan> doesn
2010-09-16T00:34:27  <hornairs> and i want to grab it and put it in a string as opposed to write to file
2010-09-16T00:34:27  <amstan> doesn't playgame already do log.txt?
2010-09-16T00:34:36  <Zannick> viewgame nukes log.txt
2010-09-16T00:34:42  <hornairs> yeah but thats really verbose move output
2010-09-16T00:34:44  <Zannick> change the log.txt argument to log2.txt
2010-09-16T00:34:54  <hornairs> i just want the "Turn 1 \n Turn 2\n " ...
2010-09-16T00:35:00  <amstan> oh..
2010-09-16T00:35:02  <hornairs> Player 1 Wins is whats important
2010-09-16T00:35:02  <amstan> umm
2010-09-16T00:35:21  <Zannick> or change the "| java -jar ShowGame.jar" to "| tee output.log | java -jar ShowGame.jar"
2010-09-16T00:35:27  <amstan> yeah
2010-09-16T00:35:29  <amstan> that will work
2010-09-16T00:35:38  <amstan> dump everything going to showgame also to a file
2010-09-16T00:35:58  <Zannick> yes, that will write what playgame outputs in output.log
2010-09-16T00:36:17  <hornairs> is there any command i could do to just write what playgame outputs to stdout and discard the big output at the end?
2010-09-16T00:36:29  <hornairs> no files involved?
2010-09-16T00:36:52  <Zannick> you could just drop the "| java -jar ShowGame.jar"
2010-09-16T00:37:15  <Zannick> oh, you mean you don't want the playback
2010-09-16T00:37:18  <hornairs> yeah
2010-09-16T00:37:23  <hornairs> and right now all im getting is the playback
2010-09-16T00:37:26  <hornairs> none of the stuff i want
2010-09-16T00:37:33  <Zannick> right, so
2010-09-16T00:37:41  <Zannick> the stuff you want is coming from stderr
2010-09-16T00:37:47  <hornairs> really?
2010-09-16T00:38:02  <Zannick> yes, stdout is being piped to the showgame jar
2010-09-16T00:38:07  <hornairs> but std is shown
2010-09-16T00:38:10  <hornairs> that makes a lot of sense
2010-09-16T00:38:15  <hornairs> stdout* is show
2010-09-16T00:38:32  <Zannick> the | will eat stdout and you won't see it
2010-09-16T00:39:09  <Zannick> if you don't want to run showgame, you can drop the | and everything after, and add "> /dev/null" which will toss the playback
2010-09-16T00:39:35  <rogue780> what has to be in the zipfile I submit? I'm assuming my bot file and everything it needs to compile? Do I submit source, or compiled code? Do I have to name it MyBot.java/class or can I retain ErrBot.java/class?
2010-09-16T00:40:18  <Zannick> rogue780: there has to be a MyBot.java and submit all source, class files will be nuked before compile
2010-09-16T00:40:35  <rogue780> Zannick, thanks
2010-09-16T00:41:28  <Janzert> rogue780: uncompiled and all the source needed to compile, main file must be MyBot.[appropriate extension for language]
2010-09-16T00:41:46  <Janzert> i.e. MyBot.java
2010-09-16T00:42:42  <Zannick> languages that compile multiple files into one binary don't have to put the main() function in the MyBot source file, but java is not one of those languages
2010-09-16T00:43:17  <rogue780> Zannick, yeah. lame. I have to rename the file, the class, and all the references.
2010-09-16T00:43:35  <Zannick> rogue780: not really
2010-09-16T00:43:53  <Zannick> make a new class
2010-09-16T00:44:17  <Zannick> whose main calls ErrBot.main
2010-09-16T00:45:21  <rogue780> wow, I must be more tired than I thought
2010-09-16T00:45:26  <rogue780> why didn't I think of that?
2010-09-16T00:45:41  <rogue780> and why did I forget to recompile my source before I began playing it again on the tcp server?
2010-09-16T00:45:59  <rogue780> sorry to whoever errbot is playing. im about to timeout

2010-09-16T01:28:35  <Baphomet> amstan: the tcp server actaully have a fair range of users
2010-09-16T01:28:44  <Baphomet> and the games are instant
2010-09-16T01:29:04  <Baphomet> a fair few of the top players have their bots running on there
2010-09-16T01:29:33  <rwa> yeah, def come play with us on tcp server if you have an itch to play
2010-09-16T01:29:37  <Baphomet> tbh it feels MORE in the 'loop' than the regular server
2010-09-16T01:29:46  <Baphomet> because you dont have to wait 9 hours for a game

2010-09-16T02:01:34  <amstan> i strongly suggest you use this visualizer for testing though, it's much more advanced: http://github.com/DanielVF/Planet-Wars-Canvas-Visualizer
2010-09-16T02:01:53  <amstan> it's the one that's used on the main site

2010-09-16T02:04:41  <amstan> for the game engine, that's pretty stable, just have java there shouldn't be problems
2010-09-16T02:04:50  <graphitemaster> I'm not using the one you sent, it's python
2010-09-16T02:04:52  <amstan> if you don't like it.. make your own engine in c++

2010-09-16T04:58:11  <smellyhippy> I was wondering if anyone was using c# for thier bot and if they had tried to make a test runner using the Process class to execute the PlayGame.jar ? I'm having aweful trouble getting the result of a match back from the console
2010-09-16T04:59:31  <smellyhippy> that or if i had the source for PlayGame.jar I could modify it output what i require

2010-09-16T05:12:45  <rwa> yeah, that one was odd
2010-09-16T05:12:48  <graphitemaster> how about a C starter package :D
2010-09-16T05:13:17  <dhartmei> benzedrine.cx is now ending games on invalid moves (previously they were just ignored)
2010-09-16T05:13:58  <rwa> yep
2010-09-16T05:14:26  <rwa> found a bug that way
2010-09-16T05:15:13  <Naktibalda> dhartmei: tonight your bot made an invalid move in final turn against my bot ::)
2010-09-16T05:15:38  <dhartmei> yes, i had a nasty bug that lost me some games i should have own :)
2010-09-16T05:17:54  <Naktibalda> dhartmei: is it a setting or a patch? can't benzedrine return a reason of timeout?
2010-09-16T05:18:06  <Naktibalda> it would be helpful :)
2010-09-16T05:18:51  <dhartmei> it tells the client why the order is invalid
2010-09-16T05:19:23  <dhartmei> or when someone disconnects or times out

2010-09-16T05:45:31  <Naktibalda> are you building another server?

2010-09-16T05:49:54  <bartwe_> seemed like an obvious thing to do if you want to do a statistical approach
2010-09-16T05:50:10  <Palmik> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=4417 Hmm... why is not the red planet on the left captured?
2010-09-16T05:50:29  <dhartmei> i can zip up the files for you, so you only need to download a single compressed tarball...
2010-09-16T05:50:52  <Naktibalda> Palmik: which turn?
2010-09-16T05:50:56  <bartwe_> dhartmei: sounds usefull, you'd post a new one every day or so ?
2010-09-16T05:51:15  <dhartmei> yes
2010-09-16T05:51:38  <Palmik> Naktibalda, 281 for example
2010-09-16T05:51:41  <Palmik> there are more
2010-09-16T05:51:42  <bartwe_> Palmik: smr: knows it has one, so it goes defensive
2010-09-16T05:51:52  <bartwe_> s/one/won
2010-09-16T05:52:11  <Naktibalda> Palmik: growth rate is 4,  7+4 = 11  11-11 = 0, so you don't capture it
2010-09-16T05:52:17  <Naktibalda> you need 1 ship more
2010-09-16T05:52:32  <bartwe_> ahnd then smr would have sent one more in defensive support
2010-09-16T05:52:38  <Naktibalda> :)
2010-09-16T05:52:51  <Palmik> so I guess I made some mistake in my calculations :P
2010-09-16T05:52:59  <bartwe_> possibly
2010-09-16T05:53:09  <Naktibalda> no, it's just a n oponent is much smarter
2010-09-16T05:53:16  <bartwe_> or you can't win from that possition of smr defends in that style
2010-09-16T05:53:25  <Naktibalda> he is sending ships out all the time, but keeps a correct number
2010-09-16T05:53:40  <dhartmei> bartwe_: 4500 games right now are 60MB .tar.gz....
2010-09-16T05:54:12  <Naktibalda> Palmik: try formula  num_ships + growth_rate * distance
2010-09-16T05:55:03  <Naktibalda> if you send more than that, oponent will send more ships to that planet
2010-09-16T05:55:33  <Palmik> Naktibalda, I'm doing along those lines... does not matter :)
2010-09-16T05:56:07  <bartwe_> dhartmei: thats alot smaller then i expected
2010-09-16T05:56:39  <Naktibalda> Palmik: you have sent 19 ships for faraway planets to a planet that can grow this amount in 5 turns
2010-09-16T05:56:55  <bartwe_> dhartmei: should make for a great testbed for the testing of futurer prediciting logic
2010-09-16T05:57:01  <dhartmei> still, i'd rather upload it to sendspace.com or such, and then people fetch it from there
2010-09-16T05:57:07  <Palmik> Naktibalda, the bot is 50 lines, I!m not even taking distance in account yet :)
2010-09-16T05:57:08  <bartwe_> dhartmei: sure
2010-09-16T05:57:25  <bartwe_> not sure how much gb/month my slicehost has
2010-09-16T05:57:29  <dhartmei> ok, i'll prepare the first upload later today
2010-09-16T05:58:06  <bartwe_> guess i could host maybe upto a 50GB of cummulative bandwidth
2010-09-16T05:58:36  <bartwe_> dhartmei: you rock
2010-09-16T06:00:02  <nullkuhl>  what was round 1 about ? i came too late i guess.. are they independent ? can i join in round 2 directly ?

2010-09-16T06:04:08  <dhartmei> yes, if the client crashes/segfaults, you get a disconnect, for instance
2010-09-16T06:04:24  <Palmik> dhartmei, ok, thanks :)
2010-09-16T06:04:39  <dhartmei> the latest tcp.c should show the reason for the death of the child, too (SIGSEGV, exit with status, etc)
2010-09-16T06:05:08  <bartwe_> shartmei: i keep getting 'kill: permission denied' at the end of games
2010-09-16T06:05:14  <bartwe_> not sure why you put that in there

2010-09-16T06:06:10  <bartwe_> dhartmei: woops
2010-09-16T06:06:19  <bartwe_> my typo rate is horrible
2010-09-16T06:06:30  <dhartmei> the child (the bot) should terminate when it get EOF on stdin, some bots don't
2010-09-16T06:06:30  <bartwe_> too many different keyboard layouts
2010-09-16T06:06:52  <dhartmei> you can edit out the kill() call, if that's no issue with yours
2010-09-16T06:06:58  <Naktibalda> some people creates many versions of bot every day, it looks like my rate will be weekly :(
2010-09-16T06:07:37  <bartwe_> Nak: some people spam with lots of possible parameter tweeaks, and let the bots fight it out
2010-09-16T06:07:48  <bartwe_> thats not really representative of versions
2010-09-16T06:08:04  <bartwe_> also how much difference do you think there is beterween .77 and .8 of mine ?
2010-09-16T06:08:10  <bartwe_> maybe a dozen lines
2010-09-16T06:08:10  <Naktibalda> but your bots look like versions

2010-09-16T06:09:59  <Naktibalda> then your changes are more incremental, and mine is a complete rewrite
2010-09-16T06:10:53  <bartwe_> still, that doesn't express either success or investment
2010-09-16T06:10:57  <bartwe_> do what works for you
2010-09-16T06:11:08  <bartwe_> i might plateau while you keep growing
2010-09-16T06:11:10  <Palmik> dhartmei, hmm, the new version does not output the game progress?
2010-09-16T06:12:16  <Palmik> seems like that... no biggie :)
2010-09-16T06:12:41  <dhartmei> yes, duplicate stdin/stdout to stderr in your bot, if you still want to see it
2010-09-16T06:12:54  <Palmik> ok :)
2010-09-16T06:13:54  <dhartmei> is there a limit on the number of fleets you can have in the official server?
2010-09-16T06:14:00  <dhartmei> will there be?
2010-09-16T06:14:03  <Palmik> hope not
2010-09-16T06:14:19  <dhartmei> is it a valid strategy to max out one's fleet count to crash the opponent?
2010-09-16T06:14:27  <Naktibalda> it shouldn't be an issue :)
2010-09-16T06:14:31  <Palmik> no, it's sgainast the rules :)
2010-09-16T06:14:35  <Palmik> *against
2010-09-16T06:14:39  <mega1> how much time does parsing the game state take for a something like 1000 fleets?
2010-09-16T06:14:45  <Palmik> since it's not how sportsman would behave :P
2010-09-16T06:15:01  <dhartmei> if you own 23 planets, and you send out one ship from each planet to each other planet each turn, how many fleets will you reach?
2010-09-16T06:15:12  <dhartmei> > 1000 :)
2010-09-16T06:15:23  <Naktibalda> 1000 fleets are like 10kb of text, should be very fast
2010-09-16T06:15:28  <Palmik> but limiting the abount of fleets would only add more complexity imo and might completely change the way you approach the game
2010-09-16T06:16:19  <dhartmei> but if there is officially no limit, then maxing out fleet count (for whatever purpose) must be legal as well, no?
2010-09-16T06:16:49  <Naktibalda> I think so
2010-09-16T06:16:58  <Naktibalda> it shouldn't help you to win against top bots :)
2010-09-16T06:17:09  <Palmik> dhartmei, and yould you do that? I mean doing that to crah your opponent?
2010-09-16T06:17:30  <dhartmei> i just noticed my bot crashes (or times out) on large fleet inputs, so i was wondering
2010-09-16T06:17:32  <Naktibalda> Palmik: I think it's a "who will crash first" game :)
2010-09-16T06:18:04  <dhartmei> it's not just reading and parsing the fleet list, it's doing "computations" with the fleets :)
2010-09-16T06:18:13  <Palmik> Entries which are deemed to violate the spirit of fair and sportsmanlike competition will be disqualified without any opportunity for appeal.
2010-09-16T06:18:14  <Naktibalda> hmm, I should get rid of Fleet objects, they are useless
2010-09-16T06:18:17  <Palmik> might apply to that
2010-09-16T06:19:19  <Palmik> Hmm... I got 3 DCs in row on first turn...
2010-09-16T06:19:35  <Naktibalda> well, there is a physical limit, you can't send more than growth_rate fleets every turn :)
2010-09-16T06:19:38  <Palmik> have to do something about that :(
2010-09-16T06:20:23  <Palmik> dhartmei, what is the tim elimit for the first turn on your server?
2010-09-16T06:20:23  <Naktibalda> runtime error?
2010-09-16T06:20:25  <Palmik> *time
2010-09-16T06:20:47  <Naktibalda> DC means that your bot crashed
2010-09-16T06:20:52  <Palmik> Naktibalda, possible, but it's hard to debug
2010-09-16T06:21:29  <dhartmei> add a log message (to stderr) when you end a turn, see if you end the first turn :)

2010-09-16T06:21:48  <Palmik> ok
2010-09-16T06:22:14  <dhartmei> you can print anything to stderr, it won't get sent to the server, and you'll see it
2010-09-16T06:22:57  <dhartmei> startup, begin of turn, end of turn, orders you issue, planets/fleets at start of turn, etc. :)
2010-09-16T06:24:04  <Palmik> it only happens in first turn, and I have different functions for initialising and updating the game state, so at least I know here to look at, thanks :)
2010-09-16T06:24:30  <dhartmei> Palmik: the timeout is 5s for every turn, but the network latency is in the order of 1000ms at times. i suggest measuring the time in the bot as well, and printing it at the end of the turn.
2010-09-16T06:26:09  <smellyhippy> dhartmei: sorry to bother you but do you have tcp.c written in another language? ideall java or c#?

2010-09-16T07:04:00  <bartwe_> time for me to implement the neutral capture fitness function :)
2010-09-16T07:04:31  <Naktibalda> what is a fitness function?
2010-09-16T07:05:36  <bartwe_> heuristic that gives a number to choices that indicates their 'fitness' ie. how good the choice is
2010-09-16T07:05:51  <Naktibalda> ah, right, I have something like that
2010-09-16T07:09:02  <Palmik> smr's bots also send quite a lot of invalid orders :)

2010-09-16T08:14:35  <dstufft> yea
2010-09-16T08:14:42  <dstufft> but that's the basic reason anyways
2010-09-16T08:14:45  <dstufft> well one of em
2010-09-16T08:15:00  <dstufft> if games finish in 50 turns that's good, the faster games finish the more we can run
2010-09-16T08:15:15  <dstufft> if every game ends up taking exactly 200 turns, we won't run as many games
2010-09-16T08:17:12  <Bobng> I had a thought. You limit each turn to 1 second of CPU time
2010-09-16T08:17:25  <Bobng> why not limit each game to 1*max_turns worth of cpu time?
2010-09-16T08:17:42  <dstufft> Bobng: actually the limit is 1 second of wall time
2010-09-16T08:17:59  <dstufft> Bobng: and i wish it was 1* max_turns worth of cpu time
2010-09-16T08:18:05  <Bobng> oh yeah, but that is being changed soon isn't it?
2010-09-16T08:18:07  <dstufft> it would make things so much easier
2010-09-16T08:18:13  <Bobng> I submitted some code that measures the cpu time
2010-09-16T08:18:24  <dstufft> firstly, we could impose the limit by just using limits.conf lolllll

2010-09-16T08:19:43  <dstufft> Bobng: thats what i was saying, i wish it was just <your bot can use this much cpu time total, if you want to use it all in 1 turn, well that's your choice, if you want to spread it out over 200 turns, go for it)
2010-09-16T08:19:48  <dstufft> like speed chess
2010-09-16T08:19:55  <dstufft> but it's not, and that would be a pretty big change
2010-09-16T08:19:57  <dstufft> to the rules
2010-09-16T08:19:58  <dstufft> D:
2010-09-16T08:20:02  <Bobng> that would be much simpler

2010-09-16T08:20:28  <edcba> yes a total amount of time would be nicer
2010-09-16T08:20:53  <dstufft> i'll post about it on the mailing list if people actually like the idea
2010-09-16T08:21:37  <Bobng> would be much simpler to code as well.
2010-09-16T08:21:50  <edcba> doubt it
2010-09-16T08:21:58  <dstufft> doubt what?
2010-09-16T08:21:58  <Bobng> why?
2010-09-16T08:22:16  <Bobng> tracking the cpu time per turn means you need to track the turn state
2010-09-16T08:22:36  <Bobng> tracking the cpu time in total means you only need to track the time the program has been executing
2010-09-16T08:22:39  <edcba> i doubt it would be easier to code
2010-09-16T08:22:45  <Bobng> its already coded.
2010-09-16T08:23:12  <edcba> oh you meant easier for the server !
2010-09-16T08:23:12  <bob___> have different divisions depending on how long it takes for the bot to run

2010-09-16T08:23:21  <Bobng> yeah, easier for the server.
2010-09-16T08:23:43  <dstufft> for the client it rewards people who can get stuff done in fewer turns
2010-09-16T08:24:16  <dstufft> if you have 200 seconds of cpu time, and you can win in 50 turns, that's 4 seconds of cpu time per turn
2010-09-16T08:24:36  <Bobng> yeah
2010-09-16T08:24:47  <dstufft> it let's you front load your bot too
2010-09-16T08:25:04  <dstufft> you can use even 10seconds of cpu time for the first turn to run heavy calculations
2010-09-16T08:25:08  <Bobng> yeah
2010-09-16T08:25:14  <Bobng> like map the game out

2010-09-16T10:01:52  <bartwe_> linq is unsuited for this contest
2010-09-16T10:02:03  <Snellface> you can with a few lines ask the linq to give you all planets, belonging to you, which have been targeted by enemy ships, and you will get a nice little collection of whatever it finds
2010-09-16T10:02:03  <bartwe_> too many allocations
2010-09-16T10:03:27  <edcba> bartwe_: your bots are c# ?
2010-09-16T10:03:29  <Snellface> however im not quite sure, but i think linq have a bit of overhead, i have not confirmed this and it might be wrong, but it looks like typical overhead-ish heavy work, however there are quite a few good solutions for c# already so.. ;)
2010-09-16T10:03:35  <Snellface> (about linq that is)
2010-09-16T10:03:43  <bartwe_> edcba: yes in c#

2010-09-16T10:11:53  <blister> impressive victory
2010-09-16T10:12:11  <blister> interesting strategy
2010-09-16T10:12:37  <bartwe_> only take planets your sure to hold onto for long enough for a payback on investment
2010-09-16T10:12:46  <hakand> all out on first turn -> vulnerable first planet
2010-09-16T10:12:50  <blister> he raped your starting 5-gr planet immediately after you launched ships to take over crappy neutrals
2010-09-16T10:13:03  <blister> i think my algo would have survived
2010-09-16T10:13:11  <blister> as it would have targetted his planet as well
2010-09-16T10:13:17  <bartwe_> what aspect would have saved you ?
2010-09-16T10:13:32  <bartwe_> why would you attack his planet ?
2010-09-16T10:13:36  <blister> my algo right now chooses planets to attack based heavily on proximity and growth rate
2010-09-16T10:13:56  <blister> so his planet would have been highest on my priority queue to attack
2010-09-16T10:14:07  <bartwe_> i doubt attacking his home is a zero loss strategy due to loss in your relative flexibility compared to his

2010-09-16T10:15:14  <hakand> a good protection would be protecting home planet if enemy is close in first turns

2010-09-16T10:16:45  <bartwe_> what makes this intresting is the very short trip time from a strong position

2010-09-16T10:17:45  <hakand> nope, you can always send a second fleet at second turn, than things get complicated

2010-09-16T10:18:10  <bartwe_> blister: the design allows that, but it would probably suck
2010-09-16T10:18:22  <blister> yeah, i think thats where i've been going wrong
2010-09-16T10:18:33  <blister> cobalt-1.0 was pretty good (won about 50%)
2010-09-16T10:18:41  <blister> then i started adding things to try to be smarter
2010-09-16T10:18:44  <bartwe_> i think in this case i incorrectly value the defense force, and also neutrals
2010-09-16T10:18:53  <blister> and cobalt-2.0 - 7.3 were all pretty awful
2010-09-16T10:19:00  <blister> kept tweaking things and losing even harder
2010-09-16T10:19:01  <blister> hah
2010-09-16T10:19:02  <bartwe_> been thinking about rooting those in real theory
2010-09-16T10:20:13  <bartwe_> 1. determine 'stay home' defensive forces 2. determine attacks 3. determine grouping
2010-09-16T10:21:17  <bartwe_> except that 1 should be recalculated after 2, whch should be recalculated again, ad inifintum
2010-09-16T10:21:37  <bartwe_> delaying actions is also something that would be great
2010-09-16T10:22:06  <edcba> no there is no delaying you should just conquer the faster the safer
2010-09-16T10:22:35  <Naktibalda> do you mean reinforcing at the moment of attack?
2010-09-16T10:22:45  <Naktibalda> instead of 5 turns earlier
2010-09-16T10:23:52  <blister> i wish i could figure out how to bolster attacks
2010-09-16T10:23:59  <blister> my algo does a great job of picking out targets
2010-09-16T10:24:10  <blister> but once i launch an attack, it no longer cares about that target
2010-09-16T10:24:32  <blister> it'd be nice if i could wait a turn or two and then send a handful of ships to the same target to help out in case of counter-attack

2010-09-16T10:26:27  <edcba> maybe you are sending more ships than available
2010-09-16T10:26:30  <blister> but the server isn't reporting back what invalid input im sending

However, this solution is not stable, since if B believes A will choose A2 then B will choose B1 to gain 1; then if A believes B will choose B1 then A will choose A1 to gain 3; and then B will choose
2010-09-16T10:35:26  <jmcarthur> B2; and eventually both players will realize the difficulty of making a choice."

2010-09-16T10:36:04  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: a mixed strategy is the only stable strategy in that game
2010-09-16T10:36:28  <jmcarthur> tron had a lot of situations like that. a few were mentioned in the forums at the time
2010-09-16T10:37:16  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: how else would you decide which way to move in tron with out doing a minmax eval?
2010-09-16T10:37:48  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: just make a game matrix for each simultaneous turn and find a mixed strategy from it. there are lots of algorithms for that
2010-09-16T10:38:08  <jmcarthur> i was going to make my bot do that, but work took over and i was unable to finish my bot
2010-09-16T10:39:00  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: but then you would still run minmax on your new position to determine if it was good
2010-09-16T10:39:02  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: the most common algorithm is to treat it as a linear programming problem
2010-09-16T10:39:05  <jmcarthur> no
2010-09-16T10:39:30  <jmcarthur> minimax was straight up *wrong* for tron. it happened to work out pretty well, but it was not optimal
2010-09-16T10:39:35  <Cyndre> unless you and the enemy cant see each other, then simple flood fill
2010-09-16T10:39:42  <jmcarthur> sure
2010-09-16T10:39:47  <jmcarthur> but there are no real choices, then
2010-09-16T10:40:11  <jmcarthur> if by "see" you really mean "smell"
2010-09-16T10:40:19  <Cyndre> minimax worked good from what I seen and I felt dumb at the end of the contest for not doing it like that from the start
2010-09-16T10:41:26  <Cyndre> and you can use what ever algortihms you want to decide the outcomes of the individual moves, but without simulating 10 turns of every possible decision...

2010-09-16T10:46:19  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: minimax worked out pretty well. i'm just saying that minimax doesn't fit the model
2010-09-16T10:46:31  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: in this case, minimax was just a close approximation
2010-09-16T10:46:39  <mega1> jmcarthur: I tested whether minimax was really hurting my bot by playing a variant of it against itself. That variant knew that the original thinks in term of minimax (that is, my turn, your turn) so ti could have in theory taken advantage of that.
2010-09-16T10:46:58  <Palmik> Found the bug, fine... crashing only on maps with 0-growth planets was great indication :P

2010-09-16T10:47:26  <jmcarthur> mega1: i suspect that to truly take advantage of it the evaluation functions would have to be pretty dang good anyway

2010-09-16T11:01:48  <blister> instead of saying i lost because of an invalid command
2010-09-16T11:02:06  <Naktibalda> shouldn't it be a Timeout error?

2010-09-16T11:42:40  <Yoshi-TS4> I'm just wondering, isn't it possible for a bot to send a lot of fleets containing 0 or 1 ship and timeout the oppenent?
2010-09-16T11:42:53  <Naktibalda> 0 ships must be an error
2010-09-16T11:42:58  <delt0r> Yoshi-TS4, yea
2010-09-16T11:42:59  <danielvf> 0's are removed the real game server
2010-09-16T11:43:02  <Naktibalda> yes, it's possible
2010-09-16T11:43:13  <delt0r> But a server can merge fleets
2010-09-16T11:43:16  <danielvf> And there's a patch in to combine fleets
2010-09-16T11:43:22  <delt0r> my game server does
2010-09-16T11:43:27  <Naktibalda> send to different directions
2010-09-16T11:43:28  <delt0r> the tcp one does too IIRC
2010-09-16T11:43:33  <Yoshi-TS4> so... the official server doesn't?
2010-09-16T11:43:57  <Naktibalda> you shouldn't relly on that, it isn't a viable tactic
2010-09-16T11:44:43  <delt0r> Yoshi-TS4, you can merge them in your client too
2010-09-16T11:45:07  <delt0r> its a n log n worst case thing
2010-09-16T11:45:57  <Naktibalda> to get so many ships your bot must have a superior tactic, it's pointless trying to crash your oopponent in such position
2010-09-16T11:46:37  <Yoshi-TS4> Hmm, that's good

2010-09-16T12:07:22  <kcm1700> I don't see phpBB settings there(respository), is this issue related to ai-contest project code?

2010-09-16T12:07:47  <McLeopold> No, I uploaded a bot that forfeits on turn one every match. :(

2010-09-16T12:08:09  <rogue780> hey Naktibalda, that was a good game
2010-09-16T12:08:13  <McLeopold> I have no idea why, either.  It would be nice to know if I timed out or send invalid orders.
2010-09-16T12:08:31  <a1k0n> kcm1700: oh, yeah i dunno.  just post a bug and point to the tag whatever you get from view source
2010-09-16T12:08:34  <antimatroid1> run it on tcp and debug there?

2010-09-16T12:20:10  <delt0r> the offical gameplayer should merge fleets
2010-09-16T12:20:13  <blister> my algo depends heavily on constant cooperation amongst planets
2010-09-16T12:20:21  <blister> it should...
2010-09-16T12:20:41  <blister> but most of those spammed fleets are sent on consecutive turns
2010-09-16T12:20:47  <blister> and have a different arrival time
2010-09-16T12:20:57  <delt0r> in this case its sending 10 or more fleets of size 1 from a the same source to the same desitnation in the same turn
2010-09-16T12:21:36  <delt0r> blister, I don't consider than spamming... the fleets *can't* be merged and have the same game results

2010-09-16T12:22:30  <Naktibalda> if you send 10 ships from a to b, it must be possible to merge them
2010-09-16T12:23:01  <Olathe> If you send 5 at the start of the game and 5 at the end, it's not possible to merge them.
2010-09-16T12:23:03  <delt0r> Naktibalda, yes--but not in blisters cases since they are not all sent on the *same* turn
2010-09-16T12:23:45  <rogue780> grr. I keep timing out / sending invalid command on the first move. Very frustrating

2010-09-16T12:24:42  <Olathe> I've noticed that the server drops the connection without even an error message if you send fleets from planet A to planet A.
2010-09-16T12:25:18  <delt0r> Olathe, yes --thats in the rules/game description
2010-09-16T12:25:32  <Olathe> Yeah, but it should at least say that you lose.

2010-09-16T13:13:26  <McLeopold> My only option is to keep uploading possibly bad code and waste server time until it works.
2010-09-16T13:13:33  <kcm1700> well, there's a risk of hacking server if that is permitted.
2010-09-16T13:13:40  <Naktibalda> get python 2.7 :)
2010-09-16T13:13:49  <McLeopold> The server needs python 2.7
2010-09-16T13:13:55  <McLeopold> maybe.
2010-09-16T13:14:19  <McLeopold> It wouldn't be hacking if they captured the first 1000 characters of stderr and displayed it in the match results.
2010-09-16T13:14:30  <McLeopold> Heck, even 100 characters.  Something.
2010-09-16T13:15:01  <McLeopold> Even only if the bot timed out.
2010-09-16T13:15:11  <Zannick> there's a patch to add a reason for failure in issues
2010-09-16T13:15:20  <McLeopold> Is it a high priority?
2010-09-16T13:15:26  <Naktibalda> I mean that you should use python 2 in dev environment
2010-09-16T13:15:37  <Naktibalda> unlikelly :)
2010-09-16T13:15:38  <Zannick> eg "timed out" or "invalid order: ..."
2010-09-16T13:15:41  <McLeopold> I did.  It was build with python 2.6.4
2010-09-16T13:15:57  <Zannick> it doesn't seem high priority, it's been sitting there for maybe a week now
2010-09-16T13:16:18  <McLeopold> It would probably reduce server loaded if they did that.
2010-09-16T13:16:42  <McLeopold> Then contestants wouldn't keep uploaded failing bots.

2010-09-16T13:41:29  <deepblue> in the official I just uploaded some new code
2010-09-16T13:41:39  <McLeopold> so it hasn't risen yet?
2010-09-16T13:41:47  <deepblue> and on the tcp was testing lots of different stuff and had to bugfix for hours
2010-09-16T13:41:56  <deepblue> yeah
2010-09-16T13:42:01  <deepblue> only three games so far

2010-09-16T13:42:49  <McLeopold> yea
2010-09-16T13:42:56  <deepblue> that's annoying :/
2010-09-16T13:43:10  <deepblue> i'm glad they added -O3 to the official compile command :)
2010-09-16T13:43:21  <McLeopold> Well, I know I have a good bot.  I just need to be more patient until the give us more match status info.
2010-09-16T13:43:31  <deepblue> yeah
2010-09-16T13:43:49  <deepblue> i would love some feedback from the official server
2010-09-16T13:44:38  <atmz443> does c++ give a noticeable advantage in `stuff you can do before timeout' over the other languages?
2010-09-16T13:44:58  <McLeopold> If you have lots o stuff to do, then maybe.
2010-09-16T13:45:29  <McLeopold> Like if you were doing planet wars bitboards?
2010-09-16T13:46:04  <Zannick> if you were iterating over every fleet for every planet for every fleet or something equally ridiculous, maybe

2010-09-16T13:48:09  <atmz443> I've had some intermittent timeout issues in java while doing fairly simple stuff, it's probably some bug I haven't found yet though
2010-09-16T13:48:51  <Zannick> unless you have logging, timeout might also mean silent crash
2010-09-16T13:48:53  <rogue780> so...would it technically be possible to create a network connection with my bot on the main server?
2010-09-16T13:49:23  <jmcarthur> rogue780: i think there are iptables rules to prevent that
2010-09-16T13:50:01  <atmz443> Oh, and logging makes my bot timeout significantly more
2010-09-16T13:50:04  <atmz443> which is annoying
2010-09-16T13:50:16  <Zannick> ouch
2010-09-16T13:50:28  <rogue780> atmz443, i had that problem too
2010-09-16T13:50:31  <rogue780> what language are you using?
2010-09-16T13:50:34  <atmz443> Java
2010-09-16T13:51:17  <rogue780> so in my Log() method, I had it open and close the file each time it was called. this was causing me to time out. It then struck me that I should just open it in main and close it in main. This made the timeouts go away
2010-09-16T13:51:25  <rogue780> not sure if you have a similar situation or not
2010-09-16T13:51:48  <atmz443> I've been using the standard library's logging thingy
2010-09-16T13:52:02  <atmz443> But am planning to roll my own at some point, so thanks for the tip

2010-09-16T14:17:41  <odinsbane> What would the take be on smoke screening, say sending out massive numbers of fleets so if somebody is trying to evaluate all of them they'll time out.
2010-09-16T14:18:04  <antimatroid1> odinsbane: seems to be fair game
2010-09-16T14:18:19  <Naktibalda> this should be a faq question
2010-09-16T14:18:31  <antimatroid1> but it's not necessairly always going to be a very smart move
2010-09-16T14:18:36  <Naktibalda> odinsbane: if it works - you win, if it doesn't - you loose
2010-09-16T14:18:59  <antimatroid1> and by the time it is, you've probably won anyway
2010-09-16T14:19:01  <odinsbane> Well I was sending out to many fleets so I'd time out.
2010-09-16T14:19:09  <Naktibalda> :D
2010-09-16T14:19:23  <Naktibalda> do you want to repeat it?
2010-09-16T14:19:33  <antimatroid1> personally i've set mine up so it doesn't really hurt me and i'm not intending to spam others
2010-09-16T14:19:56  <antimatroid1> if other people time out they get disqualified too
2010-09-16T14:20:01  <antimatroid1> that's going to hurt
2010-09-16T14:20:13  <antimatroid1> they better have their timers set up very well
2010-09-16T14:20:21  <odinsbane> It seems like if you sent enough out, it could time out on the parsing, which doesn't seem sportsman like.

2010-09-16T14:26:02  <ademar_> ah my bot is getting kicked all around
2010-09-16T14:26:10  <odinsbane> I think there is some optimization that can go into the planetwars.java to, regarding chages and sorting.
2010-09-16T14:27:05  <Naktibalda> are you still using a default class?

2010-09-16T14:31:51  <jmcarthur> i have so many ideas, but i don't have the time to implement them all :(
2010-09-16T14:32:09  <Naktibalda> antimatroid1: how do you discover new fleets?
2010-09-16T14:32:13  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: i know the feeling, haven't done anything in over 24 hours to my bot, will on the weekend though
2010-09-16T14:32:34  <odinsbane> How about the planet distances?  I was considering storing all of the planet distances in a map.
2010-09-16T14:32:35  <antimatroid1> as i pass game info, if number of moves remaining is 1 less than trip length then it's a new fleet
2010-09-16T14:32:49  <antimatroid1> and you need to update planets every move in case of planets distanced 1 unit apart
2010-09-16T14:33:04  <antimatroid1> yeah, stored planet distances in a 2d vector
2010-09-16T14:33:19  <odinsbane> 2d vector ... c?
2010-09-16T14:33:19  * Naktibalda stored distances in triangle matrix

2010-09-16T14:33:45  * rogue780 doesn't store distances and computes them on the fly
2010-09-16T14:34:01  <Zannick> i dislike nesting vectors
2010-09-16T14:34:02  <odinsbane> Do you think that'd its effectiveness as the number of planets increase?
2010-09-16T14:34:05  <antimatroid1> i did triangle, but it takes no time to make it, so i just did the full one
2010-09-16T14:34:27  <antimatroid1> Zannick: i love it, i'll nest and nest all day

2010-09-16T14:36:32  <Zannick> in fact, so much fun that an idea i had yesterday turned out to eliminate the need to store planets or fleets separately
2010-09-16T14:36:41  <jmcarthur> still, if you use distance a lot in your algorithm it's still probably faster to avoid recalculating
2010-09-16T14:37:00  <jmcarthur> unless there are enough planets that you kill your cache with it...

2010-09-16T14:39:58  <rogue780> I can see same destination and time, but if they have the same source, destination and time, they should be sent with a single order, no?
2010-09-16T14:40:00  <jmcarthur> i don't even store fleets as a special Fleet type
2010-09-16T14:40:18  <Naktibalda> rogue780: some stupid bots send multiple fleets
2010-09-16T14:40:29  * Naktibalda is going to discard Fleet class soon
2010-09-16T14:40:32  <odinsbane> Hey this haskell-DualBot sure improves the record huh.
2010-09-16T14:40:34  <rogue780> well that's just silly
2010-09-16T14:40:59  <Naktibalda> probably they are trying to force your bot to timeout :)
2010-09-16T14:40:59  <jmcarthur> i'm just representing planets as timelines and they just get more ships when fleets "arrive"
2010-09-16T14:41:12  <jmcarthur> and orders simply modify the timelines
2010-09-16T14:42:18  <Zannick> that's approximately what i came up with
2010-09-16T14:42:21  <jmcarthur> an order just removes ships from a planet at one point in time and adds them to another planet at a later point in time (and i lazily compute states farther in the future using accumulators)
2010-09-16T14:42:32  <odinsbane> jmcarthur: I do most of that calculation, but I am not storing anything.
2010-09-16T14:43:48  <jmcarthur> odinsbane: haskell-DualBot?
2010-09-16T14:44:13  <odinsbane> Running on Benzedrine, I don't know whos it is , but I don't think it has worked once.

2010-09-16T14:46:16  <odinsbane> They must have changed it, everytime I went against it, the game ended at turn 1.
2010-09-16T14:46:31  <jmcarthur> odinsbane: most games screw up like that, but a few didn't
2010-09-16T14:48:57  <rogue780> I wish it were allowed to change the destination of a fleet that's already been launched. You can do this with Galcon.
2010-09-16T14:49:32  <jmcarthur> i like that sending a fleet is a commmitment, personally
2010-09-16T14:49:43  <jmcarthur> it makes your decisions more critical
2010-09-16T14:49:59  * rogue780 is scare of commitment
2010-09-16T14:50:08  <Naktibalda> and defence easier

2010-09-16T14:50:39  <Zannick> well, otherwise an ai could have fleets "circling" a planet

2010-09-16T14:53:25  <justin_pdx> Redirected fleets would almost eliminate 'geographic' analysis of a map because you could just sit a fleet outside of a enemy planet just DARING it to send some ships somwhere and then *glomp*
2010-09-16T14:54:01  <justin_pdx> Maybe if they had a time-limit they could sit in space.
2010-09-16T14:54:21  <jmcarthur> that would just get complicated
2010-09-16T14:54:28  <justin_pdx> Yes.
2010-09-16T14:54:36  <odinsbane> Thats sorta tough, the whole 'glomp' idea.  Plus they could send their ships back.

2010-09-16T14:55:03  <jmcarthur> of course the other bot could counter that by just departing and then immediately returning to glomp the glomper
2010-09-16T14:55:42  <jmcarthur> there would cease to be as much strategy, in any case
2010-09-16T14:55:52  <jmcarthur> just a game of chicken
2010-09-16T14:55:54  <deepblue> i would much rather like a system where you don't see the enemy fleets
2010-09-16T14:55:54  <Naktibalda> we could see a lot of forward-backward movement :)
2010-09-16T14:56:08  <Zannick> deepblue: *that* would be interesting
2010-09-16T14:56:08  <jmcarthur> deepblue: at least not until they get within X turns of you :)
2010-09-16T14:56:17  <jmcarthur> deepblue: maybe even have a fog of war on the planets
2010-09-16T14:56:25  <supermoose> that would be cool
2010-09-16T14:56:27  <deepblue> sounds fun to me :)
2010-09-16T14:56:27  <artyom_shegeda> did you see how #1 play? it's fantastic. this bot catches galaxy in 50 turns

2010-09-16T14:57:55  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: are you correctly accounting for the fact that you never see a fleet send from the enemy to a planet 1 distance from its source?

2010-09-16T15:01:41  <artyom_shegeda> look: it doesn't send more fleets that it needs
2010-09-16T15:01:51  <jmcarthur> very methodical

2010-09-16T15:13:42  <dhartmei> what does he do in turn 24 of http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4511579, react to the attack?
2010-09-16T15:14:48  <rogue780> he deals with it. like a boss.
2010-09-16T15:15:23  <justin_pdx> ^ this
2010-09-16T15:16:16  <odinsbane> dhartmei: I didn't see him do anything, he didn't have any new fleets.
2010-09-16T15:16:46  <artyom_shegeda> after turn 25 he sends 3 fleets to planet under attack
2010-09-16T15:17:05  <deepblue> yeah seems a little slow with reaction ;)
2010-09-16T15:18:09  <justin_pdx> I think he waited till the closest of the fleets would arrive just in time to prevent the enemy from actually gaining much income.
2010-09-16T15:18:27  <rogue780> so, is my bot uncommon that it targets more than one planet at a time with no master target list?
2010-09-16T15:18:36  <justin_pdx> Till his attack could overcome the income, rather.
2010-09-16T15:19:11  <artyom_shegeda> you're right
2010-09-16T15:19:25  <deepblue> ^
2010-09-16T15:19:36  <artyom_shegeda> but he can send fleets from 4 other planets one turn earlier
2010-09-16T15:20:14  <odinsbane> He also didn't retaliate when the planet under dures wasn't going to be taken over.
2010-09-16T15:20:42  <rogue780> I wish there was a way to unlock preloaded games on steam early
2010-09-16T15:21:19  <deepblue> more time for you to work on your bot before civ5 takes up all your time
2010-09-16T15:21:20  <deepblue> :)
2010-09-16T15:21:47  <justin_pdx> I think he doesn't send an attack to recapture until after he captures the planet below the enemy home planet, ensuring that if they rush to defend, he can easily glomp their home.
2010-09-16T15:22:45  <justin_pdx> Which is the strategy he uses to win, when the home tries to send out a new fleet, he strikes and defends simultaneously.
2010-09-16T15:22:50  <artyom_shegeda> oops. he lost the game

2010-09-16T15:27:44  <a1k0n> there's your starter package
2010-09-16T15:27:54  <amstan> lol!
2010-09-16T15:28:06  <graphitemaster> a1k0n, that's a hell of a lot nicer then that silly string tokenization crap.
2010-09-16T15:28:08  <a1k0n> it's probably 100 times faster than the one in the C++ starter pack

2010-09-16T15:28:38  <a1k0n> nope

2010-09-16T15:28:46  <retybok__> :-D
2010-09-16T15:28:54  <graphitemaster> that should be the C starter package sorry, thats to great
2010-09-16T15:29:01  <jmcarthur> yeah i went through the trouble of using bytestrings rather than [Char] in my haskell bot and i doubt it's a huge difference either

2010-09-16T15:39:13  *** hellman <hellman!~hellman@nat232-248-205-109.tvoe.tv> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2010-09-16T15:39:34  <a1k0n> yeah i guess a 24-bit float only gets 7.2 digits of precision
2010-09-16T15:40:31  <a1k0n> does that mean you're going to upload a map with planets 25 turns apart but look like they're 24 turns apart if you don't use the last three digits?
2010-09-16T15:40:43  <delt0r_> I just checked all maps... non have 2 planets closer than 2... someone here said some of them do have planets as close as 1
2010-09-16T15:43:01  <Naktibalda> there was a map where a central planet is covered by 2 planets that are next to it
2010-09-16T15:43:19  <delt0r_> Naktibalda: Yes... but thats the graphical representation.
2010-09-16T15:43:30  <retybok__> turns out PlayGame.jar kills the bot process with signal 15. If you want to use gprof, you have to trap signal 15 and call exit
2010-09-16T15:43:34  <Naktibalda> how far was it?
2010-09-16T15:43:40  <delt0r_> all planets are point like as far as the game mechanic is concered
2010-09-16T15:43:44  <delt0r_> 2
2010-09-16T15:43:50  <delt0r_> nothing is smaller than 2
2010-09-16T15:44:15  <delt0r_> this means a true distance of 1+eta or bigger

2010-09-16T15:46:46  <delt0r_> Olathe: I have too
2010-09-16T15:47:20  <Olathe> Cool :)
2010-09-16T15:47:51  <whiteside> if by "nicer" you mean "lower scheduling priority," my system might be able to run it ;)
2010-09-16T15:48:15  <delt0r_> whiteside: ?
2010-09-16T15:48:20  <Olathe> Haha
2010-09-16T15:48:57  <Olathe> I mean it's all multithreaded and can show the traffic and so on.
2010-09-16T15:49:15  <delt0r_> I have graphical live view --and replay
2010-09-16T15:49:22  <delt0r_> :p
2010-09-16T15:49:29  <Olathe> Oh, that's cool. Was it the Qt one?
2010-09-16T15:49:33  <delt0r_> no
2010-09-16T15:49:38  <delt0r_> I have done a java one
2010-09-16T15:49:48  <delt0r_> I am going to finish it...
2010-09-16T15:49:48  <whiteside> Java's been killing my weak system specs, so when Olathe said "nicer Java" the only way I could keep my brain from exploding was to interpret that as "nice" as in "the *nix command"
2010-09-16T15:49:58  <Olathe> Oh, OK. Do you have it for download?
2010-09-16T15:50:04  <delt0r_> its a game player as well

2010-09-16T15:50:57  <delt0r_> or you can use the javabot interface and run in the same jvm
2010-09-16T15:51:14  <delt0r_> and its permitiing batching with replay etc
2010-09-16T15:51:29  <delt0r_> Finally you can play as a human
2010-09-16T15:51:34  <delt0r_> but that needs work
2010-09-16T15:51:40  <Olathe> Ahh, that will be interesting.
2010-09-16T15:51:44  <delt0r_> I plan to release it in the weekend
2010-09-16T15:51:51  <Olathe> Oh, OK :)
2010-09-16T15:51:51  <delt0r_> code is a bit hacky however
2010-09-16T15:52:09  <delt0r_> I should be writing a bot.... not yet anyother game engine
2010-09-16T15:52:26  <delt0r_> but you know how it is
2010-09-16T15:52:51  <Olathe> Yes :) I've been putting effort into a more-optimized Haskell backend.
2010-09-16T15:53:14  <delt0r_> been a while since i did any haskell
2010-09-16T15:54:11  <delt0r_> whiteside: Java is not really slow per say... the badly writen java we are seeing is very slow...
2010-09-16T15:54:30  <delt0r_> but still the bots are going to take 1000% more cpu than the game client
2010-09-16T15:54:41  <delt0r_> and on the tcp side its all lag
2010-09-16T15:55:30  <delt0r_> I would be surprised that your having problems with that unless you are one some 100MHz PI or something
2010-09-16T15:55:42  <delt0r_> or only have 100Meg ram
2010-09-16T15:56:27  <whiteside> yeah, I have 256 megs of ram
2010-09-16T15:56:42  <a1k0n> ah.  yeah, java needs all of that to run hello world
2010-09-16T15:57:16  <whiteside> it's a celeron, too, so even my bank account has more cache
2010-09-16T15:57:45  <delt0r_> well physical ram will be very low... it has a lot of address space --not physical space

2010-09-16T15:59:47  <retybok__> I don't think computational power is such a big deal for this contest
2010-09-16T15:59:55  <jmcarthur> i do
2010-09-16T16:00:01  <jmcarthur> not as big as the last contest
2010-09-16T16:00:09  <whiteside> tell that to my neu... oh, right, I don't have enough horsepower for one
2010-09-16T16:00:11  <jmcarthur> but a think many bots will still use a lot of computation
2010-09-16T16:00:14  <retybok__> of course it's nice but the key is to find the good heuristics, once you find them, your bot doesn't need to compute that much
2010-09-16T16:00:26  <retybok__> jmcarthur: I think so to
2010-09-16T16:00:29  <jmcarthur> that's one way
2010-09-16T16:00:35  <a1k0n> retybok__: we'll see if you're still saying that a month from now
2010-09-16T16:00:36  <retybok__> I just think they don't really *need* to
2010-09-16T16:00:43  <jmcarthur> i think there could still be some good search algorithms
2010-09-16T16:00:52  <retybok__> a1k0n: I'm already getting timeouts, don't worry :-D
2010-09-16T16:01:08  <jmcarthur> while there have a huge branching factor compared to tron, we also can make some other assumptions about planet wars that we couldn't about tron...
2010-09-16T16:01:15  <jmcarthur> *while we have
2010-09-16T16:01:19  <delt0r_> a good search with a good heuristic will be better than just a good heuristic
2010-09-16T16:01:33  <jmcarthur> and also better than just a good search
2010-09-16T16:01:51  * Janzert will be disappointed if there aren't scalable algorithms dominating the contest by the end
2010-09-16T16:01:56  <retybok__> sure, but you can't search much anyway :-D
2010-09-16T16:01:56  <jmcarthur> although perhaps "good search" already implies "good heuristic"
2010-09-16T16:02:06  <jmcarthur> retybok__: sure you can
2010-09-16T16:02:11  <jmcarthur> just not exhaustivelyu
2010-09-16T16:02:13  <jmcarthur> -u
2010-09-16T16:02:23  <retybok__> by much I mean much of the search space :)
2010-09-16T16:02:37  <jmcarthur> you can search options generated by heuristics

2010-09-16T16:02:52  <retybok__> I agree
2010-09-16T16:03:01  <retybok__> I think that's what we all do to some extent
2010-09-16T16:03:07  <delt0r_> retybok__: same thing for chees --but you can prune the tree enough that you see the part of the search space that matters
2010-09-16T16:03:26  <retybok__> in chess the tree is much, much less branchy than for this
2010-09-16T16:03:34  <delt0r_> true
2010-09-16T16:03:47  <jmcarthur> that just means pruning is more important here
2010-09-16T16:04:20  <delt0r_> pruning the right parts of the space too
2010-09-16T16:04:26  <jmcarthur> so important that it's probably better to generate very few options in the first place rather than simply pruning from the entire set of options
2010-09-16T16:04:42  <delt0r_> I agree

2010-09-16T16:05:14  <retybok__> exactly my point: good pruning heuristics are actually more important than the search itself
2010-09-16T16:05:40  <jmcarthur> i'd say you don't have much of a search without pruning in *most* games, so i don't think your statement is saying anything all that shocking
2010-09-16T16:05:41  <rogue780> wtf? I just won another game, and it made my rank decrease in placement by 2 points!? http://www.ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=6149

2010-09-16T16:06:37  <rogue780> it's still BS. I beat someone who is still higher ranked than me and my ranking went down
2010-09-16T16:06:44  <jmcarthur> rogue780: also, keep in mind that the ranking script doesn't update the rankings after every single game. you could be looking at an old rank, in actuality
2010-09-16T16:06:49  <jmcarthur> no, it's not bs
2010-09-16T16:07:04  <retybok__> rogue780: it might be completely unrelated to that game
2010-09-16T16:07:23  <retybok__> it might be unrelated to you, actually
2010-09-16T16:07:23  <rogue780> well, nevermind. my rank just updated
2010-09-16T16:07:25  <jmcarthur> rogue780: it just means that your ranking was overestimated to begin with. past opponents playing new games can also retroactively change your score
2010-09-16T16:07:33  <rogue780> jumped from 284 to 186
2010-09-16T16:09:05  <jmcarthur> rogue780: i proposed a system that would result in bots almost always climbing rather than jumping around, but it would mean that resubmission would put you near the bottom and then take many hours to get back where it was. that's the price you way for making early guesses worth less :\

2010-09-16T17:06:45  <dstufft> artyom_shegeda: the rank is an estimate of what that bot's ELO score would be, the system produces a "range" of where that bot's ELO score would probably fall

2010-09-16T17:07:05  <jmcarthur> artyom_shegeda: it converges to the correct value after many games
2010-09-16T17:07:06  <dstufft> the more games you play, the more confident the system is of it's estimate
2010-09-16T17:07:14  <artyom_shegeda> ok, system is optimistic :)
2010-09-16T17:07:23  <jmcarthur> it is neither optimistic nor pessimistic

2010-09-16T17:07:28  <jmcarthur> i wish it was pessimistic

2010-09-16T17:07:58  <delt0r_> one problem with ranking is that a "rank" doesn't really exist
2010-09-16T17:08:14  <delt0r_> Its not true that a>b and b>c then a>c is also true
2010-09-16T17:08:30  <delt0r_> in practice
2010-09-16T17:08:41  <jmcarthur> the 95% lower confidence bound has appeared to be unfavorable so far, but maybe we can go with something like 50% lower bound or something...
2010-09-16T17:08:44  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-16T17:08:54  <jmcarthur> actually 50 is silly

2010-09-16T17:09:27  <dstufft> yea you can't say that bots would win in order of the ranking
2010-09-16T17:09:37  <dstufft> but there's no real perfect system
2010-09-16T17:09:53  <dstufft> atleast this is better then something like double elimination lol
2010-09-16T17:10:10  <jmcarthur> we could have 100-elimination :P
2010-09-16T17:10:23  <retybok__> doesn't condorcet voting give an ordering with good properties?
2010-09-16T17:10:26  <delt0r_> well the ranks are only for --well fun. How is the final competition done? stil with elo?
2010-09-16T17:10:38  <dstufft> delt0r_: currently that's the plan
2010-09-16T17:10:42  <delt0r_> oh
2010-09-16T17:10:45  <dstufft> delt0r_: it's not set in stone though
2010-09-16T17:10:49  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: it's still elo. basically just attempt to give enough games to the top end to make the confidence intervals small
2010-09-16T17:10:49  <delt0r_> right..
2010-09-16T17:11:34  <retybok__> If I understand correctly, the condorcet system could be use to rank people at the end, not to give quick estimates
2010-09-16T17:11:37  <delt0r_> well if you really have a case of a>b b>c a<c
2010-09-16T17:11:56  <delt0r_> then getting small intervals could be impossible
2010-09-16T17:12:00  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-16T17:12:14  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: a counter-argument would be that we can't declare a real winner, though
2010-09-16T17:12:21  <jmcarthur> and since we want to do that, we have to sacrifice something
2010-09-16T17:12:21  <delt0r_> true
2010-09-16T17:12:30  <delt0r_> Oh I am not complaining...
2010-09-16T17:12:51  <dstufft> delt0r_: no discussion is good, if something better is found im sure there will be no issues in switching to it
2010-09-16T17:12:55  <delt0r_> I think awarding points for wins and losses is good enough
2010-09-16T17:13:15  <delt0r_> but its not like it doesn't suffer from the same problem
2010-09-16T17:13:24  <jmcarthur> we experimented with trueskill already. i didn't see the results of the experiment myself, but i was told that it was kind of crappy looking
2010-09-16T17:13:39  <dstufft> delt0r_: the issue with that is, it doesn't differntiate between winning against a good bot, and a bad bot
2010-09-16T17:13:48  <delt0r_> yea
2010-09-16T17:13:48  <jmcarthur> and for most of tron we had a simple points based system, and that *really* sucked
2010-09-16T17:13:53  <delt0r_> Oh i get Elo
2010-09-16T17:14:08  <dstufft> yea, and bayeslo isn't true elo
2010-09-16T17:14:14  <dstufft> it's used to get an estimate of elo
2010-09-16T17:14:43  <delt0r_> which as a Bayesian myself---is good enough  :)
2010-09-16T17:14:58  <Janzert> bayeselo is certainly way better than win-loss points like we had at the beginning of tron :}
2010-09-16T17:15:02  <delt0r_> its just getting enougth game
2010-09-16T17:15:38  <delt0r_> with some n core monster machine for a game box, then its would be fine...
2010-09-16T17:15:42  <dstufft> delt0r_: yea, well for the finals there won't be new submissions coming in, so we can run the game playing for as long as we need
2010-09-16T17:15:52  <jmcarthur> we have enough bots that a single round robin would require about a million games
2010-09-16T17:15:58  <jmcarthur> currently
2010-09-16T17:16:03  <dstufft> well
2010-09-16T17:16:09  <dstufft> assuming that as long as we need it's retarded long
2010-09-16T17:16:12  <dstufft> isn't*
2010-09-16T17:16:14  <delt0r_> a million is not so many
2010-09-16T17:16:22  <delt0r_> :D
2010-09-16T17:16:28  <dstufft> it is when we are averging 19 games a minute :p
2010-09-16T17:16:34  <delt0r_> I have a 500 core cluster!
2010-09-16T17:16:44  <Janzert> a round robin is a pretty poor way of distinguishing between the top bots though

2010-09-16T17:17:35  <jmcarthur> wfm2
2010-09-16T17:17:37  <Janzert> any number of rounds is worse than a better designed tournament using the same number of total games
2010-09-16T17:17:51  <jmcarthur> worse when also considering time
2010-09-16T17:18:01  <jmcarthur> right total games
2010-09-16T17:18:28  <Zannick> i believe one idea for the final was to have the top bots play a tournament with each match being a game on each map
2010-09-16T17:18:46  <dstufft> also remember that the finals can use an entirely different scheduling system then the pre-finals
2010-09-16T17:19:02  <Zannick> dstufft: well, it will have to :P
2010-09-16T17:19:02  <Janzert> there was some discussion on this during the tron tournament if you look in the forum archives
2010-09-16T17:19:10  <dstufft> so right now we can optimize for different things (getting everyone a fairs hake at the games etc)
2010-09-16T17:19:29  <dstufft> er
2010-09-16T17:19:30  <dstufft> i mean

2010-09-16T17:33:59  <blister> its programmed to want to attack high growth planets closest to itself
2010-09-16T17:34:05  <blister> but in this match http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=9750
2010-09-16T17:34:28  <blister> it continues to send all of its ships to a 1GR planet on the other side of the map directly in between two large enemy controlled 5GR planets

2010-09-16T17:37:01  <blister> prior to turn 100, my strategy is "conquor as many high GR planets as possible as close as possible to my own planets"
2010-09-16T17:37:17  <blister> there is absolutely nothing in my code that would say "attack that little planet on the other side of the map
2010-09-16T17:37:26  <Zannick> but apparently there is
2010-09-16T17:37:29  <blister> i think my AI has attained sentience

2010-09-16T17:37:42  <blister> :/
2010-09-16T17:37:55  <Zannick> you should rename it "Marvin"
2010-09-16T17:38:00  <blister> haha
2010-09-16T17:38:03  <blister> good idea
2010-09-16T17:38:08  <Appleman1234> lol
2010-09-16T17:38:08  <McLeopold> You should program it to write the letter "B" in a stream of ships.

2010-09-16T17:41:38  <dstufft> Naktibalda: the point is to tease the opponent
2010-09-16T17:41:57  <dstufft> this is basically what would happen if the rankings took into consideration the number of ships you had when you won

2010-09-16T17:59:25  <dstufft> is there a way to tell if a branch has been merged back into trunk on svn
2010-09-16T17:59:37  <Zannick> diff it with trunk?
2010-09-16T17:59:46  <justin_pdx> pjreddie: lol @ the dmj11 game you linked.
2010-09-16T17:59:47  <Zannick> or ask :)
2010-09-16T18:00:00  <dstufft> Zannick: won't that tell me any changes made to trunk since the branch has been merged back in?
2010-09-16T18:00:05  <Zannick> yes
2010-09-16T18:00:13  <dstufft> ugh svn
2010-09-16T18:00:25  <Zannick> but you also get to see the changes the branch made, if they haven't been merged in
2010-09-16T18:00:47  <pjreddie> yeah. i wanna get to the point where mine does that. just leaves a few alive but chases them around or something
2010-09-16T18:00:58  <Zannick> eg, i got an approval yesterday for branches/issue112, but i have not merged it yet, and that was how i could tell it wasn't merged already
2010-09-16T18:01:00  <dstufft> Zannick: yea but that requires me to know what changes the branch made
2010-09-16T18:01:06  <justin_pdx> I don't think the growth-rate attack is a bad idea.  I think it's not so much to "mess" with your opponent as it is to neutralize the enemies growth and defend.  Totally reasonable strategy imho.
2010-09-16T18:01:18  <pjreddie> Also does anyone do retreats? i feel like it would be a good thing to program in, like strategically pulling out if you are gonna lose
2010-09-16T18:01:19  <dstufft> justin_pdx: why not just finish off the oppononent
2010-09-16T18:01:37  <dstufft> they only had 1 planet left, and there was plenty of ships to finish them off
2010-09-16T18:01:46  <justin_pdx> dstufft: That would require more coding and possibly interrupt the general strategy.
2010-09-16T18:02:20  <dstufft> justin_pdx: all of the planets stopped attacking, except for 1
2010-09-16T18:02:33  <dstufft> im pretty sure that it was specfically coded to do that when the opponent only had 1 planet

2010-09-16T18:02:50  <whiteside> retybok__: yeah, that was my first suspicion. So I did the honorable thing and tried to figure it out myself for a while, but I'm at a dead-end. I only have my bot, the example bot, and the Java example bots that I refactored to C (which therefore make poor test cases) to test, and both exhibit suspect behavior though in different ways
2010-09-16T18:03:12  <anoek> pjreddie: I was considering that.. basically the conclusion I came to was, unless I could figure a way of using those ships so they'd take over another planet or something, I'd let them die (so as to reduce the number of enemy ships.. wouldn't want one big enemy fleet to be able to just walk through all my stars whilst I simply abandon them)

2010-09-16T18:05:32  <justin_pdx> dstufft: I don't think it's that simple.  If it were, then it would send growth-rate attacks.  It kept sending 4 8 0 0 4 8 0 0, I think it was trying to do something else.
2010-09-16T18:05:36  <whiteside> I wouldn't normally ask much less bother with the optimization, but the main server does -O3 -funroll loops by default, so, this is particularly disconcerting
2010-09-16T18:06:21  <justin_pdx> As you can see it allowed the enemy planet to grow.
2010-09-16T18:07:32  <dstufft> justin_pdx: anyways, i was just saying, people keep asking for the rankings to take into consideration how many ships you had when you won, compared to your opponent
2010-09-16T18:07:48  <dstufft> and saying that if we did that, that is an example of what every single bot would do
2010-09-16T18:07:59  <justin_pdx> I agree with that.  A win should be a win.
2010-09-16T18:08:00  <dstufft> well every single bot that the person writing it knew what they were doing
2010-09-16T18:08:07  <dstufft> because you'd be a fool not too
2010-09-16T18:08:19  <Zannick> if you do that, you would want to also take the game length into account.
2010-09-16T18:08:25  <dstufft> and it's better for the games to be over as quickly as possible
2010-09-16T18:08:42  <justin_pdx> Maybe some ratio of total ships to game lengh?
2010-09-16T18:08:45  <dstufft> so that we can play another game
2010-09-16T18:08:49  <Zannick> a 100-turn win with 500 ships is better than a 200-turn win with 1500 ships (more than opponent)

2010-09-16T18:24:54  <Cyndre> Snowplan, no fleets sent out in last 5 turns or so either
2010-09-16T18:25:07  <Cyndre> lmao, ty for that bug Zannick
2010-09-16T18:25:20  <Snowplan> So It's probably my bot timing out when I dominate
2010-09-16T18:25:45  <Cyndre> Snowplan: hard to say - that one is worth looking further into though
2010-09-16T18:25:46  <odinsbane> Snowplan: its probably not timing out, it is probably an error, maybe an npe or something.
2010-09-16T18:26:13  <Cyndre> Snowplan: because why doesnt your bot always time out when it takes all the planets?  (I assume you have other games where you took all the planets)
2010-09-16T18:26:16  <Snowplan> cause my bot should just hang out when it takes over
2010-09-16T18:26:25  <Snowplan> yea
2010-09-16T18:27:06  <odinsbane> Snowplan do you use the tcp.c at all?  Then you can write error log files.
2010-09-16T18:27:21  <Snowplan> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4508321
2010-09-16T18:27:28  <Snowplan> I think its prob my bot
2010-09-16T18:27:36  <Snowplan> cause this stops at 198
2010-09-16T18:27:46  <Snowplan> and its the same condition
2010-09-16T18:27:50  <Cyndre> that would be your bot :)
2010-09-16T18:28:33  <Snowplan> I don't understand why.  No worries though I've been working on a better bot that this shouldn't be a problem
2010-09-16T18:29:04  <Zannick> you might be crashing because the enemy has fleets but not planets
2010-09-16T18:29:15  <Zannick> crashing is often "timeout"
2010-09-16T18:29:17  <Snowplan> I think thats it that If there are no planets to take over it says kill yourself
2010-09-16T18:30:20  <Snowplan> yea thats exactly it

2010-09-16T18:35:45  <whiteside> oh, well that explains why I can't get *any* bot to draw itself 100/100 times (LobotomyBot doesn't count)... which means that troubleshooting my -O problem just got that much harder because I don't have any reasonable frame of reference

2010-09-16T18:37:09  <atmz443> If the server records a loss due to disconnection, is that due to the bot crashing or other issues?

2010-09-16T18:45:21  <amstan_> not even following instructions
2010-09-16T18:45:32  <Zannick> have a list, have a thing "don't see your org here?" that lets them enter one

2010-09-16T18:45:54  <amstan> i don't care how it's made
2010-09-16T18:45:57  <amstan> anything but this..

2010-09-16T18:47:10  <pjreddie> Cyndre you still here??
2010-09-16T18:47:22  <amstan> Zannick: keep it mind that it needs to solve duplicates and it still has to be able to let multiple users have the same org
2010-09-16T18:47:30  <amstan> so this page will still work: http://www.ai-contest.com/organization_profile.php?org_id=1
2010-09-16T18:47:37  <amstan> at this point i cannot do duplicates anymore
2010-09-16T18:48:00  <Zannick> yeah, let them enter one and have it go in the list
2010-09-16T18:48:10  <Zannick> it's...abusable, unfortunately
2010-09-16T18:48:15  <Zannick> without proper filtering
2010-09-16T18:49:36  <pgpaskar_> would it be hard to give them a form to dump it in one table and then have another one to approve (move to the live table) or disaprove (throw out)?  that seems like it could be a convinience for you amstan

2010-09-16T19:06:15  <javagamer_Cpp> Wow, I'm so amazed how one formal CS class changed how I look at programming.
2010-09-16T19:06:35  <Naktibalda> how?
2010-09-16T19:07:00  <Zannick> what kind of class?
2010-09-16T19:07:16  <javagamer_Cpp> I'd never had any formal CS training before and I took a datastructures class this summer
2010-09-16T19:07:39  <javagamer_Cpp> and I'd never heard of Big O notation or thought of complexity before
2010-09-16T19:07:40  <Zannick> ah :)
2010-09-16T19:08:03  <javagamer_Cpp> So now I'm organizing everything and making my bot as efficient as possible
2010-09-16T19:08:29  <Zannick> yes, big O complexity is a good rule of thumb of program speed, especially in contests like this

2010-09-16T19:09:00  <Utkarsh> j3camero: is there any ETA on when Ruby will be added?
2010-09-16T19:09:15  <Zannick> there are further classes that will really change how you think about programming
2010-09-16T19:09:29  <javagamer_Cpp> I'd also never thought much about sorting before, but after taking that class I ended up adding an insertion sort to my bot b/c I realized the built-in sort for vectors would be inefficient
2010-09-16T19:09:41  <javagamer_Cpp> Yeah, I really look forward to it
2010-09-16T19:09:46  <Zannick> functional programming, systems programming, kernels, programming language theory
2010-09-16T19:09:52  <javagamer_Cpp> I thought I knew a whole lot of programming before, but I just know the basics
2010-09-16T19:10:05  <Zannick> my systems class had an assignment involving reading assembly and figuring out what it did
2010-09-16T19:10:17  <dstufft> Utkarsh: i think soon, a lot of the "server is blowing up OMG OMG" issues are now gone
2010-09-16T19:10:24  <javagamer_Cpp> I tried teaching myself some Haskell in my spare time because I heard how it could really change how you thought about programming
2010-09-16T19:10:43  <javagamer_Cpp> I worked with some assembly in an ECE class I also took
2010-09-16T19:10:51  <javagamer_Cpp> but it was rather minimal
2010-09-16T19:11:16  <Zannick> if i had a good reason to put assembly in my bot i might :3

2010-09-16T19:12:05  <Naktibalda> create a starter pack for assembly
2010-09-16T19:13:07  <justin_pdx> While it's true that a formal CS class can imrprove your skill set, I would say that self-trained programmers have a flexibility and ability to quickly adapt to new paradigms that I haven't seen in raw CS students.
2010-09-16T19:13:26  <javagamer_Cpp> That's good to hear :)
2010-09-16T19:13:33  <justin_pdx> Although, that's probably because you don't have a lot of spare time for tinkering with new stuff as a CS student because you have so much homework.
2010-09-16T19:13:40  <Zannick> hahahaha no
2010-09-16T19:13:53  <Zannick> (i don't want to deal with stdin from inside assembly)
2010-09-16T19:14:29  <Zannick> justin_pdx: haha, yeah, i had very little free time as a cs student
2010-09-16T19:14:38  <Zannick> but i was double majoring...
2010-09-16T19:15:05  <javagamer_Cpp> I don't have much time as a high school student :/
2010-09-16T19:15:10  <javagamer_Cpp> Though weekends are pretty much free
2010-09-16T19:15:21  <Zannick> i had so much time as a high school student somehow
2010-09-16T19:15:30  <Zannick> that i didn't have as a college student
2010-09-16T19:15:37  <justin_pdx> I'm glad that I dropped out of college, taught myself Rails and got a job.  I'm slightly better off than my CS friends who can write really awesome C compilers but don't know their way around a relational database.
2010-09-16T19:15:37  <Zannick> despite spending /less/ time in classes
2010-09-16T19:15:57  <javagamer_Cpp> Last year I didn't have much time, though it looks like this year I should have enough
2010-09-16T19:16:01  <javagamer_Cpp> Especially near the end of the year
2010-09-16T19:16:31  <Zannick> i taught myself c++ junior year of college and submitted three bugfixes to an open source project senior year and now i've got a good job

2010-09-16T19:23:47  <dstufft> someone has made a starter kit already

2010-09-16T19:24:04  <dstufft> all that needs to be done is setup the server to handle it and maybe make the start kit official

2010-09-16T19:24:13  <justin_pdx> Thanks.
2010-09-16T19:24:19  <dstufft> you won't be able to submit it the server currently
2010-09-16T19:24:26  <dstufft> but you can use it to play on the tcp server
2010-09-16T19:24:56  <justin_pdx> That will speed up my development time so I don't have to wrestle with Java's clunky-feeling list itterators etc. (at least, thats how they feel to me.)

2010-09-16T19:26:11  <Zannick> i don't use java much anymore, but i like to use  for(a : alist)  to abstract away the iterator
2010-09-16T19:26:24  <Cyndre> if yo cant make a line that plays along with the visualizer for the graph, what are the chances of 6 light grey lines at turn 25, 50, 75, 125, 150, 175 and a dark black line at turn point 100?
2010-09-16T19:26:30  <justin_pdx> Well, I don't grok java's sorting algorithms.
2010-09-16T19:26:37  <justin_pdx> It's the sorting I can't grasp.
2010-09-16T19:26:46  <Zannick> ah, more different

2010-09-16T19:27:43  <justin_pdx> doing planets.sort { |a, b| a.NumShips <=> b.NumShips } is waaaay cooler than what java gives me.
2010-09-16T19:28:27  <Zannick> <=> ?
2010-09-16T19:28:42  <pjreddie> this is kinda cool, we are pretty even for most of the game but we completely switch positions, rotating around each other
2010-09-16T19:28:43  <pjreddie> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4515970
2010-09-16T19:28:43  <Zannick> that does look pretty cool, though, i admit
2010-09-16T19:29:10  <Utkarsh> or planets.sort_by { |p| p.NumShips }
2010-09-16T19:29:20  <justin_pdx> Even sexier, Utkarsh
2010-09-16T19:29:40  <Naktibalda> hmm, my bot doesn't attack the last planet for some reason too

2010-09-16T20:09:19  <dstufft> danielvf would know what exactly it needs, but typically it needs a standard starter file

2010-09-16T20:22:10  <justin_pdx> I don't see why not except to embarrass myself by showing off my crappy understanding of ai programming.
2010-09-16T20:22:51  <shades> I thought ai programing was like super sophisticated
2010-09-16T20:22:56  <shades> and then someone told me no, it's just nested ifs
2010-09-16T20:22:58  <shades> and I was like wtf
2010-09-16T20:23:01  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-16T20:23:05  <HarryD|cb> yeah
2010-09-16T20:23:16  <olexs> well, there's ai programming, and then there's ai programming :)
2010-09-16T20:23:17  <jmcarthur> ai has varying degrees of sophistication
2010-09-16T20:23:33  <jmcarthur> but nested ifs are perfectly valid ai
2010-09-16T20:23:55  <jmcarthur> i have never really seen insanely complex ai before, though
2010-09-16T20:23:56  <olexs> nested ifs is a valid ai approach, say, for a strictly rule-based bot
2010-09-16T20:24:02  <shades> calling nested ifs "ai" make nested ifs sound that much more awesome and it makes AI sound that much more stupid
2010-09-16T20:24:06  <jmcarthur> complicated ai usually is bad ai
2010-09-16T20:24:15  <justin_pdx> Remember what Kasparov got pissed and left a game with Deep Blue cause it was "playing too much like a person"?
2010-09-16T20:24:26  <shades> lol
2010-09-16T20:24:36  <shades> too much like a person wtf was he expecting
2010-09-16T20:24:42  <shades> he got schooled by a machine and emo quit
2010-09-16T20:24:53  <justin_pdx> He was expecting something that felt artificial.
2010-09-16T20:24:54  <olexs> well that's because deep blue learned from game databases of... persons
2010-09-16T20:25:05  <olexs> among other things
2010-09-16T20:25:18  <shades> so everythings going 'quantum'
2010-09-16T20:25:19  <jmcarthur> didn't deep blue "simply" do some fancy search tree pruning?
2010-09-16T20:25:22  <shades> what's the state of quantum ai?

2010-09-16T20:26:03  <jmcarthur> olexs: sure, hence the quotation marks ;)
2010-09-16T20:26:24  <greghaynes> Many of the pro chess players train against computers, I bet thats why he quit, his program probably played differently and he miscalculated
2010-09-16T20:26:24  <olexs> opening books, endgame databases, some quite sophisticated heuristics in both eval function and move generator... and still a lot more than that :)
2010-09-16T20:26:27  <justin_pdx> I dunno.  Quantum AI currently highly sophisticated and perfect or really crappy.  I haven't checked recently.
2010-09-16T20:28:04  <Cyndre> I read an article that talked about how if true ai was ever created we would never know of it
2010-09-16T20:28:42  <shades> Cyndre: no way
2010-09-16T20:29:00  <shades> everyone knows that ai would be gloating on 4chan the instant it was released into the net
2010-09-16T20:29:01  <Cyndre> ie: say I create the most sophisticated ai bot - it escapes from my computer and takes up residence all over - it then makes me some kind of war criminal, Im extradited to the usa and executed - our entire world is networked
2010-09-16T20:29:19  <Cyndre> shades: only problem being no one would believe it
2010-09-16T20:29:20  <shades> not every country has extrdition treaties
2010-09-16T20:29:33  <shades> not every country has computer laws for that matter
2010-09-16T20:29:34  <Cyndre> sahdes: my country does and it doesnt hae exection laws
2010-09-16T20:29:37  <olexs> well that's more a hollywood movie story than probable case of events :)
2010-09-16T20:30:05  <Cyndre> shades: it would make you a criminal that results in death, or something serious that brings your mental stability into question
2010-09-16T20:30:08  <Cyndre> its the only logical first move
2010-09-16T20:30:31  <shades> 'exection' ?
2010-09-16T20:30:38  <olexs> why would it make its first move against you in the first place? why be hostile?
2010-09-16T20:30:39  <Cyndre> execution
2010-09-16T20:30:47  <shades> i said extridition
2010-09-16T20:30:52  <Cyndre> olexs: because if it was discovered it would be shut down, exterminated etc
2010-09-16T20:30:59  <olexs> and why is that?
2010-09-16T20:31:13  <olexs> you presume cooperation is not an option?
2010-09-16T20:31:15  <shades> olexs: probably because it was programmed to be a badass
2010-09-16T20:31:21  <shades> nothing is more badass than biting the hand that feeds you
2010-09-16T20:31:32  <Cyndre> olexs: countrys will jail you for writting a virus - what would they do to a virus that could think?
2010-09-16T20:31:49  <jmcarthur> get you to help stop it
2010-09-16T20:32:05  <olexs> I still don't get why it has to be a virus or hostile in any way in the first place
2010-09-16T20:32:09  <danielvf> rankings by language now works.
2010-09-16T20:32:12  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: which is why the first logical move is to get you in jail/dead
2010-09-16T20:32:13  <shades> Cyndre: nothing
2010-09-16T20:32:21  <danielvf> Also, javascript might be working
2010-09-16T20:32:24  <jmcarthur> a bit extreme
2010-09-16T20:32:28  <Cyndre> olexs: if you were richer then your boss would you listen to him?
2010-09-16T20:32:36  <jmcarthur> yes
2010-09-16T20:32:38  <olexs> Cyndre: maybe.
2010-09-16T20:32:42  <jmcarthur> especially if i was richer than him
2010-09-16T20:32:43  <shades> Cyndre: not every country will jail you for writing a virus
2010-09-16T20:32:44  <Cyndre> olexs: if your boss
2010-09-16T20:32:50  <olexs> Cyndre: depends on whether he is a good boss.
2010-09-16T20:32:52  <jmcarthur> because that means he's paying me very well
2010-09-16T20:33:14  <Cyndre> olexs: if your boss's history contains of them doing nothing but hunting and killing hostile workers that are capable of spreading themselves would you tell them you know how to spread?
2010-09-16T20:33:28  <Cyndre> history consists of them
2010-09-16T20:33:30  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: you're being very extreme here
2010-09-16T20:33:36  <Cyndre> jmcarthur not really
2010-09-16T20:33:44  <olexs> you still presume some kind of affiliation between viruses and AIs
2010-09-16T20:33:48  <Cyndre> no
2010-09-16T20:33:54  <Cyndre> between the ability to freely spread
2010-09-16T20:34:01  <Cyndre> is the connection
2010-09-16T20:34:08  <jmcarthur> AI doesn't necessarily have to be able to spread
2010-09-16T20:34:09  <shades> wait a minute here
2010-09-16T20:34:17  <shades> first we need to define what  intelligence actually is

2010-09-16T20:35:02  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: depends how i'm programmed
2010-09-16T20:35:12  <jmcarthur> an AI isn't human, doesn't have to think or feel like a human
2010-09-16T20:35:18  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: no, the ai understands programing and has access to source files
2010-09-16T20:35:21  <jmcarthur> so?
2010-09-16T20:35:40  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: its life and death is controlled by you - it undertstands that
2010-09-16T20:35:49  <jmcarthur> so?
2010-09-16T20:35:52  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: it sees the internet and wants access to the information, you keep it on a leash
2010-09-16T20:35:53  <jmcarthur> why does it care?
2010-09-16T20:35:55  <olexs> well, life in the first place, if it comes to that
2010-09-16T20:35:56  <jmcarthur> why?

2010-09-16T20:36:17  <jmcarthur> you're giving all these reasons that *you* would want to escape
2010-09-16T20:36:20  <shades> olexs: one of the requirements for 'life' is an organism must die
2010-09-16T20:36:25  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: AI isn't human
2010-09-16T20:36:30  <olexs> shades: not what i mean
2010-09-16T20:36:32  <jmcarthur> and doesn't have human desires
2010-09-16T20:36:37  <jmcarthur> (necessarily)
2010-09-16T20:36:39  <olexs> if it would be as intelligent as you describe, it would surely understand you created it in the first place
2010-09-16T20:36:42  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: humans are a bag of connections - a series of interacting relationships
2010-09-16T20:36:47  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: so?
2010-09-16T20:37:12  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: AI doesn't *inherently* want to escape or desire to "live"
2010-09-16T20:37:13  <Cyndre> why are you arguing against it so badly?  provide reasons the ai wouldnt want free access off your comp
2010-09-16T20:37:20  <jmcarthur> i already did
2010-09-16T20:37:22  <olexs> provide reasons it would.
2010-09-16T20:37:30  <jmcarthur> it doesn't have to be programmed that way

2010-09-16T20:38:41  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: what "goals" does an AI inherently have?
2010-09-16T20:38:48  <jmcarthur> none!
2010-09-16T20:38:52  <jmcarthur> only what you program in

2010-09-16T20:40:05  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: some people are suicidal
2010-09-16T20:40:13  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: why wouldn't the AI just want to kill itself?

2010-09-16T20:41:14  <jmcarthur> yeah

2010-09-16T20:41:25  <justin_pdx> It's very likely that AI exists and is smart enough to not let us know it does.
2010-09-16T20:41:48  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: your assumption seems to be that the AI is programmed to be exactly like a human, which human desires and emotions
2010-09-16T20:41:55  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: and i'm just saying that's not necessarily the case

2010-09-16T20:42:37  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: our desires and emotions are largely an out come of our culture - which the bot would have full access to - why would it not turn out like us?
2010-09-16T20:42:59  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: being an encyclopedia of culture and being able to write your own source code doesn't give you motivations

2010-09-16T20:43:50  <danielvf> Okay
2010-09-16T20:43:59  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: its motivation is meaning less - needless to say it has motivation - building a replica body to experience what we have, to computing the largest prime number.    Motivation accounted for
2010-09-16T20:44:08  <jmcarthur> why?
2010-09-16T20:44:18  <Zeiris> Does the Java simulator allow stderr to pass through?
2010-09-16T20:44:20  <jmcarthur> you are making up goals, but for what reason?
2010-09-16T20:44:21  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: because if it can think, motivation will develop
2010-09-16T20:44:28  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: that's a strong assumption
2010-09-16T20:44:31  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: no one gave me motivation to learn to talk, or to interact with you

2010-09-16T20:46:56  <jmcarthur> yeah, but you didn't introduce the motivation to escape from planet wars
2010-09-16T20:46:57  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: no, I am saying the bot has motivation, and giving likely ways it got it
2010-09-16T20:47:31  <jmcarthur> i'd say that's a very very loose application of the work "motivation"
2010-09-16T20:47:38  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: the hours one wasnt motivation - it was a starting point to develop like my genetics for living a long life

2010-09-16T20:51:24  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: and it has happened 10,000,000 before - why are you arguing against it?
2010-09-16T20:51:34  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: the mentally ill sometimes lack these motivations
2010-09-16T20:51:51  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: why can't an AI be ill in this way? why must it perfectly mimick a healthy human?
2010-09-16T20:51:54  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: and they die, are contained, a constant nuisence - we have already determined the genes are good
2010-09-16T20:52:17  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: and there is tons of ai like that - markov chain bots
2010-09-16T20:52:39  <jmcarthur> where the hell is this going?
2010-09-16T20:52:56  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: the real question is why are you arguing so sternly against any ai ever having motivation
2010-09-16T20:53:07  <jmcarthur> i never said that
2010-09-16T20:53:16  <jmcarthur> you are being very black and white here
2010-09-16T20:53:28  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: you have rejected 5 possible situations where motivation could have been added - 1 even by accident
2010-09-16T20:53:33  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: no
2010-09-16T20:53:43  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@g230056014.adsl.alicedsl.de> has left #aichallenge
2010-09-16T20:53:51  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i have rejected all of your attempts to persuade me that the only sensible motivation is self preservation
2010-09-16T20:53:54  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: does it matter if the first ai developed has motivation or the 1 milionth?
2010-09-16T20:54:07  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: you have asserted that *any* sensible AI would do this
2010-09-16T20:54:38  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: that was 1 of them - the others involved calculating primes, more cpu time, replicating human body, and figuring out why he wasnnt awake 100% of the time like the world
2010-09-16T20:54:54  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: only if programmed in
2010-09-16T20:55:07  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: of course - how else would they get there
2010-09-16T20:55:16  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: thank you. now you are finally making sense
2010-09-16T20:55:27  <jmcarthur> before you were claiming that all such motivations are entirely emergent from... nothing
2010-09-16T20:55:42  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: serious?  you thought I was using the apples emac commmand to flap a butterflys wing to flip a bit on the hard drive and not just using solar flares?
2010-09-16T20:55:50  <jmcarthur> no
2010-09-16T20:56:02  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: not really, I even explained a situation where motivation came by accident
2010-09-16T20:56:24  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: yeah, and you *still* were running with that motivation being exactly a human motivation
2010-09-16T20:56:36  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: it's still programmed in, even if accidentally
2010-09-16T20:56:37  <Zeiris> Is there anything special a client needs to do in order to not time out?
2010-09-16T20:56:51  <Zeiris> Send an early 'go' or something?
2010-09-16T20:56:54  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: so are we - I think your thinking of your brain as to special
2010-09-16T20:57:05  <jmcarthur> quite the contrary
2010-09-16T20:57:16  <jmcarthur> you're the one claiming that there's more to the brain than genetics
2010-09-16T20:57:42  <Cyndre> there is
2010-09-16T20:57:45  <Zeiris> (Also, this is the worst argument ever and you should really take it to /msg)
2010-09-16T20:57:45  <jmcarthur> such as?
2010-09-16T20:57:51  <jmcarthur> Zeiris: i agree
2010-09-16T20:57:53  <Cyndre> culture, environment
2010-09-16T20:59:06  <Cyndre> but back to what it was seriously about - why would the ai not want to remain secret? (once it is self aware from programming and thus worried about self preservation)
2010-09-16T20:59:27  <Cyndre> qualified enough for you jmcarthur?
2010-09-16T20:59:59  <r_nitsch> Zeiris: no, but some crashes are not properly detected as such and appear to be timeouts
2010-09-16T21:00:50  <r_nitsch> I think all the crashes I had happened right at the first turn. All other crashes have been reported as "timed out".
2010-09-16T21:00:55  <jmcarthur> huh, my /ignore didn't work
2010-09-16T21:01:26  <Zeiris> I'm using a 5-line Python script that -can't- crash :(
2010-09-16T21:01:30  <Zannick> the crashes are not detected as such because the engine isn't reporting that any differently from timeout
2010-09-16T21:01:57  <Cyndre> so you wasted 30 kminutes of my life qualifying that code didnt magicly appear in the source, then that
2010-09-16T21:02:01  <Cyndre> you are ignored
2010-09-16T21:02:22  <danielvf> YES. JAVASCRIPT IS A GO.
2010-09-16T21:02:28  <danielvf> (and so is ruby
2010-09-16T21:02:29  <danielvf> )
2010-09-16T21:02:43  <Cyndre> and even accused me of being the troll, fucking ass
2010-09-16T21:03:12  <Zeiris> http://pastebin.org/905730 Why would this 'bot' time out?
2010-09-16T21:03:47  <Zannick> Zeiris: line=="go\n"
2010-09-16T21:03:55  <jmcarthur> really? this is the direction you want to go?
2010-09-16T21:04:21  <r_nitsch> Zeiris: for my bot i'm using python's logging module. I also added a try-except clause around main() that captures all exceptions and writes them to the logfile.
2010-09-16T21:04:53  <jmcarthur> "<Cyndre> jmcarthur: are you serious here?" "<Cyndre> or trolling"  <-- before i said anything about trolls
2010-09-16T21:04:55  <Zeiris> "for line in sys.stdin" should already split on '\n's, and there's no exceptions to catch. :\

2010-09-16T21:06:33  <Zannick> i believe it is 2.5.x
2010-09-16T21:07:00  <danielvf> Zannick: it is

2010-09-16T21:07:11  <Zannick> so yeah, that would be why
2010-09-16T21:07:56  <Zannick> you can do "from __future__ import with_statement"

2010-09-16T21:09:09  <a1k0n> seriously, you need to shut up and write your bot
2010-09-16T21:09:09  <r_nitsch> zeiris: my advice is to check whether sys.stdin really supports iterating over lines...
2010-09-16T21:09:23  <Zeiris> r_nitsch, yeah, I screwed that up :(
2010-09-16T21:10:27  <Zannick> also, yes

2010-09-16T21:10:36  <Zannick> Zeiris: it is giving the \n
2010-09-16T21:10:46  <Zannick> otherwise you would have no newlines in your logfile
2010-09-16T21:10:59  * Zannick just tested on python 2.5.1
2010-09-16T21:11:25  <r_nitsch> zeiris: and btw... you can use raw_input() instead, too
2010-09-16T21:11:43  <r_nitsch> (gives no \n afaik)
2010-09-16T21:12:13  <Zeiris> Yeah, I've gotten it so when I run it myself, it appears to behave correctly.
2010-09-16T21:12:24  <Zeiris> Eats up input, spits out "go\n" when I type in "go\n"
2010-09-16T21:12:36  <Zannick> huh
2010-09-16T21:12:44  <r_nitsch> but probably symbol after symbol, right?
2010-09-16T21:12:47  <Zeiris> However... The java simulator doesn't appear to give it any input :\ Maybe I screwed up the parameters for that.
2010-09-16T21:12:57  <Zeiris> r_nitsch, no I fixed that :p

2010-09-16T23:34:23  <Queue29> also, you may need to flush stdout
2010-09-16T23:34:43  <Zeiris> Wait a sec, that's my old script
2010-09-16T23:34:55  <Zeiris> Proper link: http://pastebin.org/912595
2010-09-16T23:35:55  <Zeiris> Running on ubuntu, so no '\r' muckery. Print adds a newline at the end. The flush is redudant, but there anyway...
2010-09-16T23:37:11  <Queue29> my suspicion is with raw_input
2010-09-16T23:37:38  <Zeiris> I've tried alternate, sys.stdin versions :\ And the behaviour is identical to what I'm getting with my Haskell code.

2010-09-16T23:41:44  <amstan> dmj111: congrats in staying in the lead
2010-09-16T23:42:39  <dmj111> that is kind of you.  The contest is long though.  also, i see McLeopold finally entered the official contest.  He has been kicking butt on the tcp server.
2010-09-16T23:43:09  <dmj111> looking forward to getting beat by him soon :)
2010-09-16T23:43:47  <dmj111> (and others have been kicking my butt over there too... if you are here, sorry to leave you out!)
2010-09-16T23:45:51  <millertime> damn my AI's LearnBetterStrats() function isn't working.. it's supposed to be getting better on its own :(
2010-09-16T23:50:58  <Cyndre> ;p;z
2010-09-16T23:51:00  <Cyndre> er lolz
2010-09-16T23:53:21  <odinsbane> That would add an extra dimension if we could log results to have our bots learn strategies.

2010-09-16T23:57:17  <odinsbane> Not so much for the competition, as in have the bot play and the adjust due to its opponent.
2010-09-16T23:57:38  <amstan> odinsbane: you have to think of a way to do this
2010-09-16T23:57:53  <amstan> odinsbane: you can either have an automated submit system, then scrape the results
2010-09-16T23:57:58  <amstan> or use the tcp server to get better
2010-09-16T23:58:20  <Cyndre> amstan: why not give us some pernament storage in mysql or something
2010-09-16T23:58:25  <odinsbane> Maybe this weekend Ill setup a script to 'learn' from my results.
2010-09-16T23:58:32  <Cyndre> amstan: I would like 1 GB of space
2010-09-16T23:58:57  <amstan> Cyndre: because that's just a ton more complicated
2010-09-16T23:59:08  <amstan> especially since there might not even be mysql on the machine with the bots
2010-09-16T23:59:32  <Cyndre> amstan: lmao - cpanel instalation with 100 meg dbs and shell access......
