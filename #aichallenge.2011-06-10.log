2011-06-10T03:00:39  <stocha> 1) I assume that bayeselo (based off the probability of winning for a pair of player) is very good ranking system.
2011-06-10T03:01:12  <stocha> 2) It can be applyed to multi-team games.
2011-06-10T03:03:12  <stocha> The multi part is resolved as follow, if 5 players play a game, and get a rank out of it (for example winner, second, third , third, four) then you can simply assume that the winner score a win against all other, and for example third score a loss against winner and second and a win against four. So you are back to meaningfull   result four couple of players.
2011-06-10T03:04:16  <stocha> for teams vs teams, you can use the thing remy coulom used for team of features obvioulsy. So bayeselo seems to be a good universal ranking system. Arguably it needs some computer ressources.  But the games here are played very slowly anyway,

2011-06-10T03:46:48  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i think they want all stuff like that in python to be used
2011-06-10T03:46:52  <antimatroid> otherwise my map gens would be c++
2011-06-10T03:46:53  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/d1GWqm9G
2011-06-10T03:47:04  <antimatroid> the second one there is what I would have expected an 8 player map to be like?
2011-06-10T03:47:09  <antimatroid> or have you just translated them?
2011-06-10T03:47:15  <locutus2> must something do to spread out more
2011-06-10T03:47:51  <locutus2> so that their can found more food!
2011-06-10T03:48:13  <smiley1983> antimatroid: the second one is just two copies of the first one side by side
2011-06-10T03:48:41  <antimatroid> i don't know about your second one :P
2011-06-10T03:48:48  <smiley1983> Okay :)
2011-06-10T03:49:01  <antimatroid> i don't think it's even symmetric?
2011-06-10T03:50:04  <smiley1983> I thought it should have rotational symmetry from the perspective of each player when the edge wrapping is taken into account
2011-06-10T03:50:25  <smiley1983> That is, if the first one is symmetrical with the edges wrapped, then it can be tiled
2011-06-10T03:50:53  <antimatroid> it might be
2011-06-10T03:50:56  <smiley1983> but there might be something wrong with that logic, which is why I want to ask someone who actually knows about symmetry :)
2011-06-10T03:51:26  <antimatroid> i'm playing around with symmetric games with my honours thesis, it's not very trivial to define symmetric games generally
2011-06-10T03:51:48  <smiley1983> Yes, I saw a bit of the earlier discussion about symmetry
2011-06-10T03:51:55  <antimatroid> atm my general working is that the game should be invariant for some ordering of the players strategies for any permutation of the players
2011-06-10T03:52:39  <antimatroid> i am thinking it is symmetric again
2011-06-10T03:52:39  <smiley1983> Clearly these maps do not meet that requirement because the neighbors are important and non-symmetrical
2011-06-10T03:53:18  <antimatroid> ... i'm not sure
2011-06-10T03:53:40  <smiley1983> I guess I could re-implement this stuff in Python, but I won't, so there's no actual need to answer the question now
2011-06-10T03:53:56  <antimatroid> we want as many types of symmetric maps as possible though anyway
2011-06-10T03:56:05  <smiley1983> The code for the rotation and tiling is quite short, so I'll pastebin it and put the link into my question in case anyone wants to do the Python version and wants a template to work from.
2011-06-10T03:58:51  <smiley1983> antimatroid: you are right about one of your earlier comments that map generation is interesting
2011-06-10T03:59:00  <antimatroid> :P
2011-06-10T03:59:11  <antimatroid> finally, mcleopold and i don't understand the lack of interest
2011-06-10T03:59:57  <UncleVasya> locutus2: I've made a simple solution to avoid ants thronging: when all main instructions already given to the ants my bot makes ants that left free to "fear" each other. Every of them steps to the cell which is far away from other ants.
2011-06-10T04:00:04  <antimatroid> i'm still chuffed with the method for doing tilings on a discrete torus
2011-06-10T04:00:31  <smiley1983> well, there was a functioning game when I found out about the contest development, so I looked at that first...
2011-06-10T04:00:41  <antimatroid> ... what about planet wars?
2011-06-10T04:00:47  <smiley1983> I had a look at the code for that, I think I understand it now
2011-06-10T04:01:32  <smiley1983> I found out about planet wars about two weeks into the contest, and hadn't nearly enough time to implement my ideas, so map generation didn't even enter my mind
2011-06-10T04:01:47  <antimatroid> 2 weeks in? :P
2011-06-10T04:01:56  <antimatroid> that still gave you over 2 months, but fair enough
2011-06-10T04:01:58  <smiley1983> maybe 10 or 11 days...
2011-06-10T04:03:02  <smiley1983> I spent the first few weeks working out how the game worked, so by the time I had a clear picture of what I wanted to build, I only had half of that left, and I wasn't adventurous enough to try for the larger scale plans :)
2011-06-10T04:04:10  <UncleVasya> locutus2: it's a temporary solution and later I'll have aims for all of my ants
2011-06-10T04:05:26  <antimatroid> smiley1983: did you use game trees?
2011-06-10T04:05:50  <smiley1983> no, but those were among the larger scale plans
2011-06-10T04:05:58  <antimatroid> i want to do another game where game tree's work well again
2011-06-10T04:06:08  <smiley1983> I have no experience implementing game trees, but would like to learn
2011-06-10T04:06:16  <antimatroid> tron tron tron!!! :)

2011-06-10T04:06:23  <smiley1983> I think this is not the contest for it, which is why I want to see tron back up :)
2011-06-10T04:06:53  <antimatroid> no, i've pretty much given up on game trees
2011-06-10T04:07:09  <antimatroid> although janzert/etc, laugh at the fact that i actually implement the trees :P
2011-06-10T04:07:33  <smiley1983> I really tried hard to work out ways to make game trees work in this, and had even worked out a way in which something gametree-like could be processed in the available time... but then decided the benefit of that system would be minimal
2011-06-10T04:07:50  <smiley1983> what do you mean, implement each level of the tree in code?
2011-06-10T04:08:00  <smiley1983> or something else?
2011-06-10T04:08:07  <antimatroid> if i was game treeing this, i would partition ants into sets that can affect each other, then just do the normal game tree thing for one depth
2011-06-10T04:08:19  <antimatroid> i actually implement a game tree
2011-06-10T04:08:27  <antimatroid> i think they just search the tree without storing it all

2011-06-10T04:10:12  <smiley1983> mcstar: good morning
2011-06-10T04:10:28  <antimatroid> but you can have a queue of extendable nodes, and keep extending the tree for x amount of time, then make your move based off the tree you have
2011-06-10T04:10:51  <antimatroid> you can make some kind of priority queue for extending nodes if you want to go down that route
2011-06-10T04:11:24  <smiley1983> okay... so does that mean you're looking at subsequent levels in the game tree without looking at every node in the first level?
2011-06-10T04:11:43  <antimatroid> in tron, we checked all possible moves at each layer
2011-06-10T04:11:59  <antimatroid> in planet wars, i literally went through and picked out what looked like ideal moves, then used those at each layer
2011-06-10T04:12:34  <antimatroid> i don't think my game tree helped much with pw though
2011-06-10T04:12:46  <antimatroid> too many bugs and not enough state search
2011-06-10T04:12:53  <smiley1983> Right... and did bad results from the tree result in cancelled orders?
2011-06-10T04:13:03  <antimatroid> cancelled?
2011-06-10T04:13:08  <smiley1983> or was it evaluating different strategies?
2011-06-10T04:13:35  <smiley1983> If you're picking ideal moves, what if the game tree says the result is bad?
2011-06-10T04:13:48  <smiley1983> do you cancel the order, or evaluate another order-picking function?
2011-06-10T04:13:50  <antimatroid> a "move" for me had a single destination and multiple sources sending ships at various points in time, I would make a move by considering planets I knew I could at least own for a turn
2011-06-10T04:13:58  <antimatroid> then I also considered making "no move" at each layer
2011-06-10T04:14:15  <antimatroid> so if nothing seemed best, it would do nothing, or stop sending moves after the number of planets it had decided to take
2011-06-10T04:14:31  <antimatroid> i could only get like 2-3 layers deep with that though
2011-06-10T04:14:53  <antimatroid> i also had heuristics for stuff like defense, redistribution and redirection
2011-06-10T04:15:18  <smiley1983> Right, thanks for explaining it (sorry, I seem to remember you made a post at the time, I should really go back and read it)
2011-06-10T04:15:35  <antimatroid> meh, i'm happy to talk about game theory almost whenever :P

2011-06-10T04:16:21  <antimatroid> if tron does go up again, i'll make a simple game tree bot for open release
2011-06-10T04:16:39  <smiley1983> that would be useful
2011-06-10T04:16:56  <antimatroid> like a starter bot for game trees ehe
2011-06-10T04:17:08  <antimatroid> making it easy for people to play around with the evaluation function
2011-06-10T04:17:54  <smiley1983> Yes, it's much easier to replicate a structure once you've worked with an existing implementation of it
2011-06-10T04:17:54  <UncleVasya> antimatroid:  Haven't  you tried to program chess or checkers?
2011-06-10T04:18:08  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: no, it's been done to death ;)
2011-06-10T04:18:18  <antimatroid> i would be tempted to play around with go, but i've never really played it

2011-06-10T04:21:18  <antimatroid> it's a kirby
2011-06-10T04:21:24  <mcstar> and why are those bots greyed out?
2011-06-10T04:21:54  <smiley1983> ghost - high water marks of former uploads
2011-06-10T04:22:34  <mcstar> theres too many of them now
2011-06-10T04:22:56  <smiley1983> so you can see that the rank-1500+ who just beat you has re-uploaded and was previously rank 4
2011-06-10T04:23:39  <smiley1983> I think they're still working out when and how they should be cleared
2011-06-10T04:23:58  <mcstar> maybe there should be an rss feed orsomething that keeps us posted and we could archive them

2011-06-10T04:28:08  <antimatroid> to the beta server?

2011-06-10T04:28:57  <antimatroid> why put the starter bots on there?
2011-06-10T04:29:27  <mcstar> there was talk to upload the starter bots to see which language is the best :D
2011-06-10T04:29:28  <smiley1983> to make the rankings mean less :)

2011-06-10T04:30:02  <aerique> the starter bots are just there for testing
2011-06-10T04:30:14  <antimatroid> the starter strategies are meant to be the same aren't they?
2011-06-10T04:30:19  <antimatroid> my starter bot strategy is really stupid
2011-06-10T04:30:35  <aerique> most use the go n, e, s or w unless there's water in the way
2011-06-10T04:30:40  <antimatroid> i like having everyone start from really crap strategies, so people can see how they do relative to each other participant
2011-06-10T04:30:48  <aerique> McLeo wanted them to be stupid
2011-06-10T04:31:08  <antimatroid> aerique: yeah McLeopold and I both wanted that
2011-06-10T04:32:07  <mcstar> yes we understand its stupid, so what?
2011-06-10T04:32:21  <mcstar> just load it up :D
2011-06-10T04:34:14  <stocha> my first test case bot just picked a direction at random. That's all.
2011-06-10T04:34:28  * mcstar thinks that antimatroid stopped beleiving that the pure power of c++ should be enough
2011-06-10T04:34:45  <antimatroid> mcstar: ??/
2011-06-10T04:35:00  <antimatroid> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=132
2011-06-10T04:35:01  <stocha> i think he refers to your giving up trees ?
2011-06-10T04:35:25  <antimatroid> oh yeah, that's just not happening
2011-06-10T04:35:36  <antimatroid> i will  use something like a decision tree for a single ant at a time maybe
2011-06-10T04:35:44  <antimatroid> but no way game tree's are working with the amount of ants
2011-06-10T04:35:59  <antimatroid> if you do 3 ants with 5 moves each that's 5^3 states you need to check
2011-06-10T04:36:11  <antimatroid> keep going for more ants
2011-06-10T04:36:36  <mcstar> i thought about planning usual battle configurations by hand
2011-06-10T04:36:49  <antimatroid> i would love to see that
2011-06-10T04:36:57  <mcstar> i mean thinking them through and coding them by hand
2011-06-10T04:36:58  <mcstar> lol
2011-06-10T04:37:11  <antimatroid> we considered multiplayer game of life, even worked out the rules, but decided it'd be too complicated/messy
2011-06-10T04:37:20  <mcstar> only considering a couple of ants each time
2011-06-10T04:38:09  <antimatroid> i've no idea what to do about actual fights
2011-06-10T04:38:19  <mcstar> so a per-ant game tree is not unfeasible
2011-06-10T04:38:30  <antimatroid> i suspect i'll heuristicise by moving them as close to me as possible, then checking the best move for each ant
2011-06-10T04:38:49  <antimatroid> if you're just moving one ant, i'd be inclined to call it a decision tree
2011-06-10T04:38:58  <antimatroid> a game requires n>2 players affecting each others outcome
2011-06-10T04:39:02  <antimatroid> >=*

2011-06-10T04:43:48  <antimatroid> :P
2011-06-10T04:44:12  <antimatroid> curious, if my starter bot has a wall above two ants, they don't make a move
2011-06-10T04:45:18  <mcstar> de-bug time then
2011-06-10T04:45:42  <antimatroid> ah, cause tehy don't mind colliding into each other
2011-06-10T04:45:44  <antimatroid> they're swapping places
2011-06-10T04:45:56  <mcstar> huh?
2011-06-10T04:46:04  <mcstar> the engine supposed to kill them both
2011-06-10T04:46:10  <antimatroid> no, they swap places
2011-06-10T04:46:10  <mcstar> arent it?
2011-06-10T04:46:17  <mcstar> delete that
2011-06-10T04:46:25  <antimatroid> no, that's how starter bots are meant to work
2011-06-10T04:46:28  <mcstar> im just drinking my first coffee
2011-06-10T04:46:29  <antimatroid> so people know that's what happens
2011-06-10T04:46:51  <mcstar> right, swapping is allowed

2011-06-10T05:04:56  <smiley1983> hi :)
2011-06-10T05:05:11  <smiley1983> rabidus: currently there isn't a home nest, I don't think one will be added
2011-06-10T05:05:54  <antimatroid> rabidus: that was my game :(
2011-06-10T05:05:57  <antimatroid> it was "too hard"
2011-06-10T05:06:14  <antimatroid> you had to harvest food and take it back to base to spawn more ants
2011-06-10T05:06:18  <antimatroid> and ants had hp
2011-06-10T05:06:21  <antimatroid> it was glorius
2011-06-10T05:06:36  <smiley1983> it would have been cool, but I can see why they simplified it
2011-06-10T05:06:38  <antimatroid> it was like future cop lapd preccint assault
2011-06-10T05:06:56  <smiley1983> perhaps we can do the complex version in zeta :)
2011-06-10T05:07:02  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-10T05:07:09  <antimatroid> frontier has an awesome visualizer
2011-06-10T05:07:28  <rabidus> antimatroid: imo that wasn't too hard at all
2011-06-10T05:07:37  <rabidus> i think this current game is "way too easy"
2011-06-10T05:07:43  <antimatroid> i agree to some degree
2011-06-10T05:07:52  <antimatroid> but oh well
2011-06-10T05:08:20  <antimatroid> and you had to actually attack an enemy
2011-06-10T05:09:12  <smiley1983> I think they should return to only assigning points for kills, not spawn
2011-06-10T05:09:43  <smiley1983> again, I can see their logic in rewarding the player for food collection, but it's a better game the other way
2011-06-10T05:10:37  <smiley1983> I do think the food bonus at the end is good, though, to ensure there is no incentive to "farm" enemy ants
2011-06-10T05:11:44  <antimatroid> we could try that
2011-06-10T05:12:08  <antimatroid> mcleopold and i had a fairly lengthy discussion about adding in the spawn points
2011-06-10T05:12:22  <antimatroid> basically there should be a nice progression towards the top of the leaderboard for a contestant
2011-06-10T05:12:45  <antimatroid> and obviously food collection is one of the first things people will look at, they should see a big increase in their ranking after addressing that
2011-06-10T05:12:52  <smiley1983> maybe switch halfway through so that people get their reward when writing the food collection, and are then given an incentive to focus on battle :)
2011-06-10T05:12:55  <antimatroid> i still think people need to do more than just collect food to compete near the top
2011-06-10T05:13:17  <rabidus> area managment

2011-06-10T05:14:21  <smiley1983> It probably doesn't actually affect the quality of the game too much, removing spawn points, so probably not worth causing the upset
2011-06-10T05:14:40  <antimatroid> yeah, people will yet at any changes now
2011-06-10T05:14:45  <antimatroid> look at the 'r' lines :P
2011-06-10T05:14:57  <antimatroid> we decided over a month ago to get rid of them :P
2011-06-10T05:15:09  <sir_macelon> i have an issue for the local visualizer: i run my bot with command "java -cp ../../bin MyBot" and the viz names it "bin"
2011-06-10T05:15:15  <sir_macelon> whom to address that?
2011-06-10T05:16:16  <antimatroid> mcleopold/frontier/sigh i guess?

2011-06-10T05:20:24  <sir_macelon> how come he's number 4 without a path finding algorithm?
2011-06-10T05:21:13  <sir_macelon> either ranking is not working well or we have some too easy maps
2011-06-10T05:21:36  <antimatroid> who?

2011-06-10T05:22:55  <smiley1983> All the bots are pretty simple at the moment, I think - the site tells you not to upload your newest and most secret code, after all :)
2011-06-10T05:23:37  <smiley1983> My bot on the beta server is a fork from month-old code, tweaked a bit to make it a bit more effective. All its code is obsolete.

2011-06-10T05:25:17  <sir_macelon> antimatroid: yes
2011-06-10T05:25:22  <stocha> some bots can be quite strong without path finding.
2011-06-10T05:25:47  <stocha> when they have individual ants behavior that build up a nice global behaviro
2011-06-10T05:25:53  <sir_macelon> but i saw some with path finding already and they should be ahaed of such bots
2011-06-10T05:26:09  <stocha> (quite strong compared to starter bots, or even simple static greedy bot)
2011-06-10T05:26:24  <sir_macelon> but without path finding all ants got stuck at some point
2011-06-10T05:26:47  <stocha> for example, with the a 1 1 die ratio, my but was on par with a bot with almost no path finding
2011-06-10T05:26:51  <carlop> depend, cause food spawning generally assure that you can got unstuck
2011-06-10T05:27:01  <sir_macelon> any who would implement such a fancy global behaviour without a basic path finding?
2011-06-10T05:27:25  <stocha> i thinkg it still has limitation. but i was impressed :)

2011-06-10T05:30:24  <stocha> It showed me some aspect of the games i didn't think about too much before.
2011-06-10T05:30:52  <stocha> i'm excited to see other alien ideas :)

2011-06-10T06:58:52  <mcstar> i read wiki and found this Dijkstra's algorithm
2011-06-10T06:59:24  <mcstar> pathfinding on this map has some peculiarities
2011-06-10T06:59:34  <mcstar> the measure is nice

2011-06-10T07:00:11  <mcstar> in the beginning i think ill try some simple method
2011-06-10T07:00:13  <rabidus> i'd take a look breadth-first search
2011-06-10T07:00:23  <mcstar> just to get to points i can see anyways
2011-06-10T07:00:40  <mcstar> yeah, antimatroid always says that
2011-06-10T07:00:52  <mcstar> but that isnt very ai-ish
2011-06-10T07:00:52  <rabidus> what, bred.. ?
2011-06-10T07:00:56  <mcstar> aham
2011-06-10T07:00:58  <rabidus> oh why?
2011-06-10T07:01:13  <antimatroid> bfs is easy
2011-06-10T07:01:27  <antimatroid> you mark squares you've visited and add new ones to a search queue
2011-06-10T07:01:49  <antimatroid> A* is good if you have a single target source and destination, but i don't really see when you're going to have that

2011-06-10T07:02:23  <mcstar> i want something like vision
2011-06-10T07:02:32  <antimatroid> ?
2011-06-10T07:02:44  <mcstar> detect if it is in line of sight
2011-06-10T07:02:46  <mcstar> and such
2011-06-10T07:02:51  <antimatroid> how are people collecting food without pathfinding?
2011-06-10T07:02:56  <mcstar> i know bfs could be used
2011-06-10T07:03:06  <mcstar> well i collect it randomly
2011-06-10T07:03:11  <mcstar> wo pathfinding
2011-06-10T07:03:28  <mcstar> i mean i prefer directions that point towards food
2011-06-10T07:03:39  <mcstar> basically i make all my moves random
2011-06-10T07:03:57  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: I think A* can be implemented in Ants even if you're don't know a single destination.
2011-06-10T07:04:02  <mcstar> just dont hit water, and dpending on turn, prefer different things
2011-06-10T07:04:11  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: how?
2011-06-10T07:04:22  <antimatroid> you don't want to calculate distances to heaps of target squares every move
2011-06-10T07:04:36  <antimatroid> and if you're iteratively changing target information you can't hash the values

2011-06-10T07:05:48  <antimatroid> you could use it with the "objective thing" to minimise the closest friend ant, but yeah, i just don't see that being efficient
2011-06-10T07:06:17  <UncleVasya> antimatroid:  Or it's not actually A*. Begin like BFS but sort nodes via some function - is this of the ways A*  can be done?
2011-06-10T07:06:44  <UncleVasya> I'll try to explain now and you'll decide: A* it's or not, ok? :)
2011-06-10T07:07:11  <antimatroid> If you have a target square, A* basically searches like bfs, but the queue is ordered based on how close the search squares are to the target
2011-06-10T07:07:15  <antimatroid> at least that's my understanding of it
2011-06-10T07:07:40  <UncleVasya> not always *how close*
2011-06-10T07:07:45  <antimatroid> so if you can order them based off something like min distance to a target
2011-06-10T07:07:53  <antimatroid> or whatever other objective function you want to use
2011-06-10T07:08:15  <sir_macelon> for example i don't use bfs, but a*
2011-06-10T07:08:29  *** xQuasar <xQuasar!~xQuasar@123-243-2-159.static.tpgi.com.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-10T07:08:32  <UncleVasya> cost function is the way you determine how close node to the target.
2011-06-10T07:08:38  <antimatroid> sir_macelon: but how?
2011-06-10T07:08:44  <antimatroid> what's your objective function?
2011-06-10T07:09:20  <antimatroid> for example, if i collect a piece of food, i have 2 new squares that available to be used in the future and 1 square no longer available, how do you then efficiently say find the closest available ant to a square or whatever?
2011-06-10T07:09:25  <UncleVasya> But to "be in less distance" not always means "be the closes one".
2011-06-10T07:09:55  <sir_macelon> antimatroid: what do you mean with objective function?
2011-06-10T07:10:09  <antimatroid> well your a* search needs an objective function right?
2011-06-10T07:10:15  <antimatroid> like minimise the distance to this location?
2011-06-10T07:10:21  <sir_macelon> yes
2011-06-10T07:10:24  <antimatroid> or minimise the distance to any of the locations in this set
2011-06-10T07:10:25  <antimatroid> whatever
2011-06-10T07:10:52  <antimatroid> do you have multiple sources? and multiple targets?
2011-06-10T07:10:59  <sir_macelon> i estimate the distance first by calculating shortest possible path
2011-06-10T07:11:03  <antimatroid> i do a bfs from all food squares simultaneously looking for any friend ant
2011-06-10T07:11:16  <UncleVasya> antimatroid:  objective function can be done  like "how long ago was a free ant in this squar?"
2011-06-10T07:11:22  <sir_macelon> then sort the targets
2011-06-10T07:11:34  <sir_macelon> and do a* when needed only
2011-06-10T07:11:42  <sir_macelon> not for all as you do
2011-06-10T07:11:50  <sir_macelon> saves a lot of time
2011-06-10T07:12:10  <antimatroid> when do you use it?
2011-06-10T07:12:35  <sir_macelon> only for the closest estimated ant to target
2011-06-10T07:12:38  <antimatroid> like, are you searching from one food item to one ant? multiple food items to one ant? one food item to one ant? or multiple food items to multiple ants?
2011-06-10T07:12:41  <sir_macelon> then i calculate the path
2011-06-10T07:12:50  <antimatroid> hmmm, that's not optimal though?
2011-06-10T07:12:53  <antimatroid> in fact far from it
2011-06-10T07:12:56  <UncleVasya> And if you are choosing between two or more nodes to open next you pick the squar where a free ant was not very long ago.
2011-06-10T07:12:57  <antimatroid> depending on water blocks
2011-06-10T07:13:13  <UncleVasya> So you'll kinda "track" it.
2011-06-10T07:13:28  <sir_macelon> and if it turns to be longer than estimated, means there are some obstacles on the way, then i sort them again
2011-06-10T07:13:56  <sir_macelon> it works perfect for me
2011-06-10T07:14:03  <antimatroid> more variation the better
2011-06-10T07:14:06  <antimatroid> i'm sticking to bfs i think
2011-06-10T07:14:08  <sir_macelon> why you think it's not optimal?
2011-06-10T07:14:29  <antimatroid> because you might have a closer ant in another direction?
2011-06-10T07:14:48  <antimatroid> maybe i'm misunderstanding
2011-06-10T07:15:02  <antimatroid> regardless, I can't think of any time I want to find paths without multiple sources and targets
2011-06-10T07:15:05  <sir_macelon> no, because i sort them by closest distance to closest target
2011-06-10T07:15:16  <antimatroid> oh okay, sure
2011-06-10T07:15:17  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Do i need to try explain better (with vocabulary) or you've got my idea?
2011-06-10T07:15:32  <sir_macelon> every iteration i sort them
2011-06-10T07:15:43  <rabidus> 14:14 < antimatroid> i'm sticking to bfs i think
2011-06-10T07:15:46  <rabidus> bfs as boyfriends
2011-06-10T07:15:54  <rabidus> ;)
2011-06-10T07:15:57  <antimatroid> :)
2011-06-10T07:16:09  <antimatroid> i'm tempted to do something like sir_macelons
2011-06-10T07:16:29  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: I don't really see where you're going sorry :P
2011-06-10T07:16:37  <antimatroid> are you marking the last turn in which an ant occupied a square?
2011-06-10T07:16:43  <antimatroid> what about if the square hasn't been occupied?
2011-06-10T07:17:08  <sir_macelon> i check only first squre on the path
2011-06-10T07:17:27  <sir_macelon> then detect collisions and recalculate paths when needed
2011-06-10T07:17:36  <UncleVasya> if no squares been occupied than it's became a simple BFS until we'll find a such square.
2011-06-10T07:17:38  <antimatroid> isn't it kind of expensive to find the closest ant without water?
2011-06-10T07:18:02  <sir_macelon> no, because it's simple heuristic by distance
2011-06-10T07:18:11  <antimatroid> yes, but what if you have 500+ ants?
2011-06-10T07:18:14  <sir_macelon> and then simple sort
2011-06-10T07:18:21  <sir_macelon> o(log n)
2011-06-10T07:18:33  * antimatroid isn't a very good programmer btw
2011-06-10T07:18:57  <sir_macelon> i cache paths :)
2011-06-10T07:19:20  <sir_macelon> and can handle even more than 500 ants :)
2011-06-10T07:20:45  <sir_macelon> for bfs with 500+ you'd be easily timed out
2011-06-10T07:21:01  <antimatroid> no, because i bfs from all food squares until i find an ant
2011-06-10T07:21:06  <antimatroid> cheap as chips
2011-06-10T07:21:13  <antimatroid> more ants the better :P
2011-06-10T07:21:40  <sir_macelon> but what if you have 500 ants and a single food tile?
2011-06-10T07:21:51  <antimatroid> move my closest ant towards it then move onto other stuff
2011-06-10T07:22:08  <antimatroid> more problem is 1 ant and 500 food tiles
2011-06-10T07:22:15  <sir_macelon> anyway if you have 500 ants in the game then your battle tactic probably sucks :)
2011-06-10T07:22:15  <antimatroid> but you can stop collecting food after a while
2011-06-10T07:23:51  <mcstar> sir_macelon: then how do you explain this number? 44.43
2011-06-10T07:24:34  <sir_macelon> btw, have you considered such situation: **.a. *.a ?
2011-06-10T07:24:47  <antimatroid> me?
2011-06-10T07:24:49  <sir_macelon> **.a.*.a
2011-06-10T07:24:53  <sir_macelon> yup
2011-06-10T07:24:56  <antimatroid> you mean with making sure you collect both now?

2011-06-10T07:25:58  <mcstar> described

2011-06-10T07:26:11  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-06-10T07:26:20  <sir_macelon> mcstar: yes
2011-06-10T07:26:35  <antimatroid> you could do stuff like collect the food that the least number of ants can get to fastest with the ant that can reach the least number of such food squares
2011-06-10T07:26:41  <antimatroid> but then it's still heuristiccy
2011-06-10T07:26:45  <sir_macelon> but these are rare really
2011-06-10T07:26:55  <antimatroid> i think i'll just ignore such cases
2011-06-10T07:27:07  <antimatroid> there's also things like b...*..a.*
2011-06-10T07:27:25  <carlop> yeah, finding optimal task for collecting food i think is an hard task, and i suppose anyone should use heuristic for approssimate the optimal one
2011-06-10T07:27:59  <sir_macelon> but what if : **.a.*.a......******
2011-06-10T07:28:13  <antimatroid> you'd really want to use a tree for collecting optimally, but one doesn't have the time
2011-06-10T07:28:25  <carlop> i think bfs + doing some random change to see if overall result can be improved + heuristic is the only way
2011-06-10T07:28:39  <sir_macelon> and you don't see all the food on the right yet

2011-06-10T07:29:43  <antimatroid> biggest balance is spreading out for food collection / visibility vs. bunching up for fighting

2011-06-10T07:33:49  <antimatroid> good defense can be set on them though
2011-06-10T07:34:06  <carlop> depend on the condition, but can be blocked without loss

2011-06-10T07:36:15  <carlop> sorry, going to lunch, after that i will put the link
2011-06-10T07:36:59  <antimatroid> that middle B will die btw
2011-06-10T07:37:18  <antimatroid> and also the one above and bloe
2011-06-10T07:37:35  <antimatroid> erm sorry, 2 B's die, 4 a's die?
2011-06-10T07:37:35  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: BFS begins from the food to find nearest ant. When it finds a squar 4 it opens that node before others. After that the next node will be 3 and so one until it find an ant.
2011-06-10T07:37:37  <antimatroid> is that right?

2011-06-10T07:43:24  <sir_macelon> carlop: in 3rd example B dies
2011-06-10T07:43:41  <sir_macelon> antimatroid: i don't think so
2011-06-10T07:43:43  <mcstar> (helll im using vim shortcuts in emacs)
2011-06-10T07:43:51  <antimatroid> the sedond row and second last row?
2011-06-10T07:44:06  <antimatroid> i think those 2 b's die
2011-06-10T07:44:47  <sir_macelon> antimatroid: indeed, you are right
2011-06-10T07:45:12  <antimatroid> :)
2011-06-10T07:45:31  <carlop> they should receive 1/2 damage from the higher ant and 1/3 damage from the center a, so I think that they survive
2011-06-10T07:45:48  <antimatroid> each a only has 2 b's within range
2011-06-10T07:45:52  <antimatroid> any b with 2 a's in range dies
2011-06-10T07:46:20  <antimatroid> i still prefer the power battle option
2011-06-10T07:46:43  <carlop> what example you are talking ? i think in 3rd and 4th the center attacker ant see 3/4 b
2011-06-10T07:46:50  <antimatroid> def enemies(A) to be the set of enemy ants in battle range of ant A, A lives if |enemies(A)| < |enemies(B)| for all B \in enemies(A)

2011-06-10T07:51:14  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: you could still do a* with that
2011-06-10T07:51:37  <antimatroid> just order squares based off distance from your food square and then the last time it was accessed by an ant
2011-06-10T07:51:46  <antimatroid> rather than first off the last time it was accessed by an ant

2011-06-10T07:53:06  <carlop> np
2011-06-10T07:53:17  <antimatroid> oh wait, they are in your examples?
2011-06-10T07:53:37  <antimatroid> in the third and fourth example, 2 B's die
2011-06-10T07:53:55  <antimatroid> the attackradius is 2 remember
2011-06-10T07:54:03  <sir_macelon> carlop: middle a ants deal 1/2 damage, just enough to kill b
2011-06-10T07:54:04  <antimatroid> with the eucledian metric on the wrapped map
2011-06-10T07:54:36  <carlop> middle ant in 3rd do only 1/4 of damage, cause she see 4 enemy
2011-06-10T07:54:51  <antimatroid> it's not how many enemies you see
2011-06-10T07:54:59  <antimatroid> it's how many enemies are within the attack radius
2011-06-10T07:55:00  <antimatroid> which is 2
2011-06-10T07:55:40  <carlop> yeah, central A have all B at distance < 2

2011-06-10T07:56:31  <sir_macelon> carlop: yes in 3rd example b survives
2011-06-10T07:56:35  <antimatroid> B can play a guessing game if they want to osscilate back and forth

2011-06-10T07:57:57  <antimatroid> in fact, i really like this example
2011-06-10T07:57:59  <carlop> for me B can wait it their line, every A that stay at distance attack death (without killing everyone)
2011-06-10T07:58:02  <sir_macelon> well, now i'm confused
2011-06-10T07:58:05  <antimatroid> B can block a if they pre empt what a will do
2011-06-10T07:58:10  <antimatroid> and they can tossle back and forth
2011-06-10T07:58:22  <carlop> it's not needed to move, B can hold position, without guessing
2011-06-10T07:58:49  <carlop> still in other condition, eg 2v1, can be needed guessing and scissor rock paper
2011-06-10T07:58:51  <antimatroid> sir_macelon: turns out your example was the same
2011-06-10T07:58:56  <antimatroid> consider this...
2011-06-10T07:59:21  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/Pzx027yy
2011-06-10T07:59:42  <antimatroid> 4 b's die in the second example no?
2011-06-10T07:59:55  <antimatroid> argh
2011-06-10T07:59:58  <antimatroid> i am retarded :)
2011-06-10T08:00:01  <carlop> i think all A die in second example, and all B survive
2011-06-10T08:00:10  <antimatroid> no ant
2011-06-10T08:00:13  <antimatroid> 's battle :P
2011-06-10T08:00:13  <carlop> sorry
2011-06-10T08:00:36  <antimatroid> alright, the battle radius is almost certainly going to change once i talk to mcleopold
2011-06-10T08:00:45  <carlop> yeah, in first example, in second A can wait, but B have done is work blocking the corridor
2011-06-10T08:01:08  <sir_macelon> same map should be played with different attack radiuses
2011-06-10T08:01:14  <carlop> but this kind of issue can be found with almost all attack radius
2011-06-10T08:01:22  <antimatroid> try attack2 = 5
2011-06-10T08:01:28  <antimatroid> that gives "knight" moves too

2011-06-10T08:50:48  <antimatroid> yeah, okay
2011-06-10T08:50:50  <antimatroid> hmmmmmmmmm
2011-06-10T08:50:57  <carlop> for this case i'm proposing a non deterministic death system, say that the damage system can be kept, in top of that we can think that a ant will die with probability f(damage received)

2011-06-10T08:55:57  <Zaphus> whats the problem with having blocking patterns ?
2011-06-10T08:56:39  <antimatroid> Zaphus: it encourages an incredibly boring game to watch, and fairly uninteresting ai imo
2011-06-10T08:57:13  <antimatroid> although watching defense structures be attempted to be made a ripped down will be entertaining
2011-06-10T08:57:24  <Zaphus> I guess so, assuming it works in practice
2011-06-10T08:58:40  <carlop> but in almost the current map is possible to have a perfect defence, that assure you that after clear a part of the map you could just wait till the end (and the other bot can be the same in his part)
2011-06-10T08:59:11  <antimatroid> yeah, current maps are just examples
2011-06-10T08:59:16  <stocha> the combat system is settled.
2011-06-10T08:59:28  <antimatroid> stocha: not if it's broken
2011-06-10T08:59:36  <antimatroid> nobody will want to make changes
2011-06-10T08:59:39  <antimatroid> and i think it'll be alright
2011-06-10T08:59:49  <antimatroid> but if the game was shown to be broken, we reserve the right to change stuff
2011-06-10T08:59:51  <stocha> i'm afraid that it being serverly broken would make hard to push the ant game to live.
2011-06-10T08:59:54  <Zaphus> depends on the defn of broken though
2011-06-10T09:00:17  <Zaphus> can anyone actually make a bot yet to block the map and demonstrate ?
2011-06-10T09:00:32  <carlop> maybe I
2011-06-10T09:00:37  <stocha> You don't only have to block. You have to have your blocking enabling you to win.
2011-06-10T09:00:38  <antimatroid> i also don't think blocking is as trivial as some people make out either
2011-06-10T09:00:49  <antimatroid> i think we'll be alright
2011-06-10T09:00:53  <stocha> Blocking depends on fighting distance. And fighting distance in not settled.
2011-06-10T09:00:59  <carlop> no, is not trivial, but i think that can ruin the game
2011-06-10T09:00:59  <antimatroid> i think we should change the attack radius though
2011-06-10T09:01:19  <stocha> so unless you kinda build a generic blocker with fight distance as a parameter ... noone will block at this point
2011-06-10T09:01:22  <antimatroid> carlop: any preferences other than 5?
2011-06-10T09:01:25  <stocha> but for experimentation maybe :p
2011-06-10T09:01:26  <antimatroid> and anyone else for that matter?
2011-06-10T09:01:49  <stocha> what's the current distance ?
2011-06-10T09:01:56  <antimatroid> attack2 = 4

2011-06-10T09:02:04  <stocha> when i experimented with 5, i was quite happy with it.
2011-06-10T09:02:19  <antimatroid> yeah, i will talk to mcleopold and sigh
2011-06-10T09:02:21  <stocha> Although i think that blocking will not cripple the contest.
2011-06-10T09:02:36  <antimatroid> i'm going to put some serious effort into maps once i finish exams
2011-06-10T09:02:48  <stocha> if does well, that's another story to be told. But you have to have complex bot to show that.
2011-06-10T09:02:56  <sir_macelon> but we should avoid strategies based solely on fixed attack range
2011-06-10T09:03:00  <Zaphus> I'll bet you can still make blocking patterns with 5, it just requires more ants in a fatter wall
2011-06-10T09:03:17  <stocha> 5 is easier to block than 4
2011-06-10T09:03:37  <stocha> i think. well i didn't dig into 4 much in fact.
2011-06-10T09:03:39  <Zaphus> sir_macelon:  you need fixed rules, it's too much to ask people to code for variable rules (IMHO)
2011-06-10T09:03:55  <stocha> let's says that blocking with 5 is easy, espcially for very tiny coridors.
2011-06-10T09:04:18  <stocha> Variable rules is okay. As long as it is fixed as a variable :p
2011-06-10T09:04:26  <carlop> i've show attack=5 blocking pattern, with 6-width corridor
2011-06-10T09:04:26  <Zaphus> what if water dried up during the match ?  :-)
2011-06-10T09:04:42  <stocha> fixed as being variable, with fixed range and exact probability of each range.
2011-06-10T09:04:44  <carlop> edit: attack2
2011-06-10T09:05:02  <Zaphus> stocha: and the server needs to be doing those variable numbers from day #1
2011-06-10T09:05:11  <stocha> carlop: can you give a pictture ?
2011-06-10T09:05:29  <carlop> attack2=5: http://pastebin.com/Wa0HdEE3
2011-06-10T09:05:43  <stocha> Zaphus: i agree. From day one of live contests, all must be fixed. Hence an extended beta period.
2011-06-10T09:05:57  <carlop> attack2=4: http://pastebin.com/aAMSAYu1
2011-06-10T09:06:39  <antimatroid> Zaphus: OH GOD!
2011-06-10T09:07:02  <stocha> why are there a AND b in the blocking pattern ?
2011-06-10T09:07:05  <antimatroid> that would be horrible for path finding
2011-06-10T09:07:33  <stocha> water drying up would be no problem for me so far :)
2011-06-10T09:07:43  <stocha> it would only make path finding easier and easier
2011-06-10T09:08:06  <stocha> that's an interesting idea. to put with dynamic maps in general :p
2011-06-10T09:08:27  <stocha> At least it probably has very interesting game acceleration property the water drying.
2011-06-10T09:08:35  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: a fixed rule for is a damage rule, but attack range should be changed to see how well the bots can cope with it
2011-06-10T09:08:43  <carlop> A is the attacking team, going to death in Thermopylae, B is defending team that survive forever
2011-06-10T09:09:00  <stocha> but ... i think map mapping is tricky enough without being dynamic.
2011-06-10T09:09:09  <sir_macelon> we shouldn't enforce bots with fixed strategies
2011-06-10T09:09:23  <stocha> carlop : a blocking pattern don't depend on the opponents strategy
2011-06-10T09:09:39  <stocha> it works for all opponents strategys
2011-06-10T09:09:51  <stocha> so there should be no A in the patterns.
2011-06-10T09:09:54  <carlop> that is the opponent best strategy, every other strategy can't be better
2011-06-10T09:09:57  <Frontier> sir_macelon: I don't add player names to the replays. You'd have to ask McLeopold
2011-06-10T09:10:02  <stocha> ah okay
2011-06-10T09:10:41  <stocha>    B %%%.B.. ..a..B. ...a.B.   ...a.B. %%%%%%%%%
2011-06-10T09:10:55  <stocha> first pattern of attack=5
2011-06-10T09:11:09  <stocha> what prevent A to send only one ant and to kill one B.
2011-06-10T09:11:33  <stocha> the second b starting from top more specifically
2011-06-10T09:12:11  <carlop> how is possible that less ant can kill more enemies ?
2011-06-10T09:12:40  <stocha> it's possible that one ant, actually kill another ant. With a 1:1 ratio. depending on the topology :p
2011-06-10T09:13:08  <stocha> and i think in your first pattern, you can have some A approching and killing exactly one B
2011-06-10T09:13:21  <stocha> so it would destroy the pattern, and prove it is not a static block.
2011-06-10T09:13:23  <carlop> show me where to put the a that can kill
2011-06-10T09:14:22  <stocha> mmm
2011-06-10T09:14:26  <stocha> maybe i'm wrong :p
2011-06-10T09:14:40  <stocha> it's hard with all the ascii stuff.
2011-06-10T09:14:43  <Zaphus> how about someone makes a bot that actually implements some of these, to demonstrate ?
2011-06-10T09:14:56  <Zaphus> can we make multiple accounts during the beta ?
2011-06-10T09:14:56  <carlop> the a line is the "line of fire", if the defense work no A can be to the right, and be to the left don't influence the outcome, and the best possibility for break defense is attack with all possible ants
2011-06-10T09:16:04  <stocha> mm but for the second pattern
2011-06-10T09:16:09  <stocha> the big wall of Bs
2011-06-10T09:16:22  <stocha> what if a go toward with a straight wall ?
2011-06-10T09:16:33  <stocha> what if A go toward with a straight wall.
2011-06-10T09:16:49  <stocha> it suffice that one B dies, and it's not a static blocking scheme.
2011-06-10T09:16:56  <carlop> Zaphus: i think yes, locutus2 already do a copy of himself, but i don't know official answer
2011-06-10T09:17:20  <antimatroid> Zaphus: go for it!
2011-06-10T09:17:30  <Zaphus> if so, I might try a test bot to do some blocking over the weekend, to see if it's plausible
2011-06-10T09:17:39  <stocha> carlop: but maybe you pattern works :p
2011-06-10T09:17:48  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-590cffc1.pool.mediaWays.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-06-10T09:17:59  <antimatroid> as long as you aren't spamming, multiple bots is fine during beta
2011-06-10T09:18:07  <stocha> i have trouble solving the death rules just with my head :p
2011-06-10T09:18:17  <antimatroid> it's a bannable offense to have more than 1 account for the official server later
2011-06-10T09:18:43  <stocha> but people need to have server where they can put multiple instances with different features.
2011-06-10T09:18:44  <antimatroid> although where people messed up emails/genuinely weren't using more than 1 account in pw, the unused account was just deleted
2011-06-10T09:18:55  <stocha> so someone will have to provide it. if officials don't.
2011-06-10T09:19:45  <Zaphus> yeah, thats fine (for PW I was probably the one person with multiple accounts legitimately, because I made the starterbot accounts as a baseline, with permission)
2011-06-10T09:19:49  <stocha> zaphus asked officially for puting on a copy.
2011-06-10T09:20:20  <antimatroid> http://www.wimp.com/withoutrope/ == my hands are now a river
2011-06-10T09:20:33  <Zaphus> stocha:  if you want to test multiple bots when it goes live, use the TCP server (assuming there is one)
2011-06-10T09:20:34  <stocha> problem with blocking is that you need a lot of ants to do it. not to mention you have to analyse the map etc.
2011-06-10T09:20:42  <antimatroid> Zaphus: there will be one
2011-06-10T09:20:56  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't have a problem with blocking
2011-06-10T09:20:59  <antimatroid> but i don't want it to be too easy
2011-06-10T09:21:07  <stocha> Zaphys> tcp server ask for you to have a machine available to host your own bot. obviously not everybody will have just that.
2011-06-10T09:21:19  <antimatroid> ideally it would have been impossible to completely block arbitrary width corridors
2011-06-10T09:21:25  <stocha> although tcp is still important in my opinion :)
2011-06-10T09:21:40  <antimatroid> how are they goingto upload a bot without a computer?
2011-06-10T09:21:42  <Zaphus> stocha: yep, but someone else could also start a hosted server too, it's all open sourced...  not as likely to happen though
2011-06-10T09:22:03  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  write it on their phone.  it's actually plausible if you can zip the files
2011-06-10T09:22:20  <antimatroid> phones, what are they?
2011-06-10T09:22:24  <antimatroid> i don't even own a mobile :P
2011-06-10T09:22:36  <stocha> they can have a computer, and wife. then they can't use the computer at night :p
2011-06-10T09:22:43  <stocha> and hardly during the day.
2011-06-10T09:23:09  <stocha> especially if the computer is old, with a 200w signature. And heavy fan noise.
2011-06-10T09:23:22  <antimatroid> what would be cool would be to make the main server run with tcp bots
2011-06-10T09:23:32  <stocha> It's summer here. wife don't want the pc to heat the room even more :p
2011-06-10T09:23:38  <antimatroid> so you can upload your bot, or just run it locally
2011-06-10T09:23:45  <antimatroid> server bots get less games
2011-06-10T09:23:51  <stocha> the main server ?
2011-06-10T09:23:57  <antimatroid> it's winter here :P i need all the heat i can get
2011-06-10T09:23:59  <stocha> you mean the official server ?
2011-06-10T09:24:06  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-10T09:24:26  <stocha> that would make the contest depend on everyone's hardware
2011-06-10T09:24:39  <stocha> so univ people wich access to cluster will win the finals :p
2011-06-10T09:24:51  <stocha> (assuming computing power maters, wich is not proven but well)
2011-06-10T09:25:22  <stocha> i think the idea of the final going with everyone having same resources is good.
2011-06-10T09:26:46  <Zaphus> quick understanding of the combat rules:   each ant that can attack other ants gives 1/N damage to each of those ants, everything is summed, those that hit 1.0 die, right ?  (and we hope for no rounding errors)
2011-06-10T09:26:55  <antimatroid> did anyone watch that link?
2011-06-10T09:27:27  <stocha> zaphus: i think yes. and rounding error are not likely
2011-06-10T09:27:35  <stocha> what link ?
2011-06-10T09:27:54  <stocha> with N other other ants
2011-06-10T09:28:05  <Zaphus> ok, so I'm looking at the 3-corridoor block someone pasted...  how can 2 of the B's be standing within attack range ?
2011-06-10T09:28:34  <stocha> b don't kill each others
2011-06-10T09:28:50  <stocha> a ant do 1/N damage to each of N ENNEMY ant in range.
2011-06-10T09:29:18  <Zaphus> correct, but there are 2 B's 2 squares from A's, thats not a stable position
2011-06-10T09:29:32  <stocha> A's are not important in those patterns.
2011-06-10T09:29:40  <Zaphus> who is doing the blocking ?
2011-06-10T09:29:40  <stocha> only B and water matters really.
2011-06-10T09:29:48  <stocha> i think it is B
2011-06-10T09:29:56  <Zaphus> hmm, I think it is A
2011-06-10T09:30:11  <sir_macelon> contestbot: later tell mcleopold i have an issue for the local visualizer: i run my bot with command "java -cp ../../bin MyBot" and the viz names it "bin"
2011-06-10T09:30:11  <contestbot> sir_macelon: I think that worked...
2011-06-10T09:30:13  <Zaphus> but I'll check on paper
2011-06-10T09:30:15  <stocha> B indeed look like he is trying to block :)
2011-06-10T09:31:12  <carlop> a possibilities for avoiding block is persistent HP (so sooner or later defender will die) or probabilities death (for me the best thing but not so obvious for newcomers)
2011-06-10T09:31:17  <stocha> the question is does it work for all A strategy, without B ever loosing a ant.
2011-06-10T09:31:32  <stocha> carlop : game fighting rule is settled yet.
2011-06-10T09:31:46  <carlop> ok
2011-06-10T09:31:47  <stocha> the only thing not settled is map generation at the moment.
2011-06-10T09:32:19  <carlop> i know that a lot of discussion have been made, I discover this year contest only 2 days ago...
2011-06-10T09:32:34  <stocha> yeah, i understand you position :)
2011-06-10T09:32:54  <stocha> the thing is, it is settled. you can still discuss it for entertainment purpose though.
2011-06-10T09:33:02  <Zaphus> ok, I see - convex hull focuses the attack so you can't step into that area...  but it totally relies on there being no other way to enter to attack from the other side, which is weak.
2011-06-10T09:33:04  <stocha> or you can read the forum.
2011-06-10T09:33:45  <stocha> Zaphus : it's a blocking setting. So now you can analyse each and every map and sees if this situation might occur
2011-06-10T09:34:06  <stocha> if it occurs, you have : does it work against dumb bot. And then how does it fares against strong bots :)
2011-06-10T09:34:11  <carlop> but if you can block a 6 width corridor, for a lot of map is possible to block all the way to your area, so other block guarantee that no-one can come from behind
2011-06-10T09:34:19  <Zaphus> You'd still need to seal more than 50% of the map so that you get most of the food, but it would be interesting!
2011-06-10T09:34:45  <stocha> If you hare 100% protected, and opponents aren't you don't need a lot of map.
2011-06-10T09:34:57  <stocha> most possibly you can just try to endure. And hope to finish 2d
2011-06-10T09:35:08  <Zaphus> Unless someone can do even a minor exploit of it in the Beta, I can't see why it would be worth worrying about - assuming people try
2011-06-10T09:35:14  <Zaphus> ok, you take 2nd,, I'll take 1st :-)
2011-06-10T09:35:38  <antimatroid> carlop: there were two contests last year :P
2011-06-10T09:35:43  <stocha> Yet, you have to look at real maps, and see if 100% protection is possible. and then you have to wonder if it is achievable when playing against the strong bots.
2011-06-10T09:35:45  <antimatroid> i don't think we'll manage another this year though
2011-06-10T09:35:45  <carlop> I know...
2011-06-10T09:36:14  <antimatroid> oh, i misread, nevermind d;
2011-06-10T09:36:21  <stocha> So someone focusing on that topic would be intersting during beta test anyway :)
2011-06-10T09:36:22  <carlop> I do tron and skipped PW cause have a busy period
2011-06-10T09:37:34  <Zaphus> my current bot has sat near the top with it's strategy (not perfect, but pretty good) - I'll see if I can modify it to 'want' to do blocking instead of what it does... or maybe switch to blocking after XX turns (you need enough ants first)
2011-06-10T09:37:46  <carlop> i will go for write a blocking bot, without exploring - pathfinding - attacking, just find a blockable area and wait
2011-06-10T09:38:07  <stocha> you need enough ant
2011-06-10T09:38:12  <stocha> and to protect your weak side
2011-06-10T09:38:16  <stocha> ideally
2011-06-10T09:38:33  <stocha> so do a greedy bot, with a few exploring
2011-06-10T09:38:36  <stocha> so it can still grow a bit
2011-06-10T09:39:06  <stocha> and then when you have enough ant, you can block that area. while a few ant still go by greedy/ + a litle explore
2011-06-10T09:39:06  <Zaphus> map1 has a couple of areas you should be able to hold, if you get lucky to get them - small though
2011-06-10T09:39:17  <carlop> yeah, i mean don't write "near optimal pathifinding" or other difficult thing
2011-06-10T09:39:23  <antimatroid> you're all welcome to try your hand at map generation
2011-06-10T09:39:26  <antimatroid> it's lots of fun!
2011-06-10T09:39:35  <stocha> optimal pathfinding is trivial.
2011-06-10T09:39:39  <stocha> ah
2011-06-10T09:39:44  <stocha> for empty maps i mean :)
2011-06-10T09:40:43  <carlop> i think optimal pathfinding is not so trivial, but maybe we have different definition of optimal and trivial
2011-06-10T09:41:05  <stocha> well, some pathfinding is needed for a greedy bot. so we agree on that :)
2011-06-10T09:41:12  <stocha> and then also some collision avoidance
2011-06-10T09:41:15  *** sir_macelon <sir_macelon!c06482ee@gateway/web/freenode/ip.192.100.130.238> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-06-10T09:41:16  <antimatroid> optimal is easy, efficiently, that's another topic
2011-06-10T09:41:16  <stocha> because collision can hurt a lot.
2011-06-10T09:41:31  <stocha> so: greedy a bit of explore (if no food in sight) and then a bit of collision avoidance.
2011-06-10T09:41:40  <stocha> you then have a base for a blocker test.
2011-06-10T09:41:48  <carlop> "given an empty map, no fog of war, and no enemy, what's the fastest way of collect all the food" ?
2011-06-10T09:41:58  <antimatroid> that's not path finding
2011-06-10T09:42:01  <antimatroid> that's more than path finding
2011-06-10T09:42:08  <stocha> that's difficult i agree :)
2011-06-10T09:42:36  <antimatroid> my method isn't optimal there but it's pretty good
2011-06-10T09:42:42  <antimatroid> much better than say hunterbot
2011-06-10T09:42:45  <stocha> although in a lot of case a simple greedy scheme might prove efficient. but that's more that path finding on an empty map :p
2011-06-10T09:43:03  <stocha> the reference is the greedy food gathering i think.
2011-06-10T09:43:48  <carlop> symmetric7, it's easy to block with few ant every isle
2011-06-10T09:44:13  <stocha> the one that stocha curently use to be specific about it :p
2011-06-10T09:44:37  <stocha> so build a prototype carlop, that will be fun :)
2011-06-10T09:44:44  <stocha> if you can hack it quick
2011-06-10T09:45:04  <stocha> map analysis seemed a bit tricky to me though. last time i tried :p
2011-06-10T09:45:13  <stocha> hope you'll have more easiness out of it.
2011-06-10T09:45:19  <stocha> so we can have a blocker on the test
2011-06-10T09:46:05  <Zaphus> can someone look at the 3-corridoor block pattern ?  I have a question
2011-06-10T09:46:50  <Zaphus> the bottom B is vulnerable, the position of the 'a' to the left of it gets a 1-1 kill (they both die) - how is that a block ?
2011-06-10T09:47:39  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@145.115-50-210.dynamic.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-10T09:47:48  <stocha> if true, then it's not a blocK; does A have a strategy to get there ?
2011-06-10T09:48:14  <carlop> what link, i pasted here a lot of bugged one....
2011-06-10T09:48:23  <Zaphus> just walk down the corridor on the bottom row, the ant will kill the bottom ant
2011-06-10T09:48:28  <stocha> A can only go through the . marked
2011-06-10T09:48:29  <carlop> but i think that the final one should be right
2011-06-10T09:48:47  <Zaphus> this one:  http://pastebin.com/Wa0HdEE3
2011-06-10T09:48:49  <stocha> it's radius = 5 i think
2011-06-10T09:48:59  <Zaphus> yeah, whats our radius set to ?
2011-06-10T09:49:06  <stocha> raduis=5   != radius=4
2011-06-10T09:49:14  <stocha> current is 4
2011-06-10T09:49:24  <carlop> attack2=4: http://pastebin.com/aAMSAYu1
2011-06-10T09:49:29  <Zaphus> ok :-)
2011-06-10T09:50:05  <stocha> radius=5 is first civlization game city raduis :p
2011-06-10T09:50:34  <carlop> there are blocking pattern both for attack2 = 4 or attack2 = 5 (and i suspect for almost all attack2>=2)

2011-06-10T09:56:46  <stocha> water evaporating maps solve the blocking problem. this is true and simple :p
2011-06-10T09:57:31  <stocha> i kinda like the idea, especially if it happens late in the game. Like from half game, to end up with no water left near the end. it's worth trying :p
2011-06-10T09:57:57  <stocha> it could mean some change to the engine. Wich would be bad if the change are heavy.
2011-06-10T09:58:37  <stocha> like : if a food spawn over water, it evaporate the water instead of growing a food.
2011-06-10T09:59:05  <stocha> or even the food replace the water.
2011-06-10T10:01:48  <smiley1983> From my early tests, I thought that attackradius^2 of 5 made blocking patterns too easy to create, and that radius^2 of 4 would have to be used
2011-06-10T10:01:57  <smiley1983> but perhaps with water evaporating 5 would be possible
2011-06-10T10:04:27  <antimatroid> i don't think water evaporating is going to happen
2011-06-10T10:04:33  <antimatroid> it's a big change
2011-06-10T10:04:41  <smiley1983> no, probably not
2011-06-10T10:05:37  <stocha> you tryed a blocker bot smiley ?
2011-06-10T10:05:44  <smiley1983> not sure if it's any better than the ascii, but here's an image of that blocking pattern with radius 5: http://imgur.com/Xq4KL
2011-06-10T10:06:03  <smiley1983> no, I made a utility to test some patterns graphically

2011-06-10T10:07:19  <stocha> bah, i guess the problem is more that it's difficult to solve combat in the head, rather than picturing.
2011-06-10T10:07:28  <stocha> i think frontier had it.
2011-06-10T10:07:44  <stocha> because he worked on the visualizer.
2011-06-10T10:08:14  <smiley1983> searching logs...
2011-06-10T10:08:47  <stocha> it was quite a few weeks ago
2011-06-10T10:08:58  <stocha> you maybe faster with googling it :p
2011-06-10T10:09:09  <carlop> smiley1983: your blocking patter is equal to mine (and you can block a 6-corridor with the same patter, adding another row in the middle)
2011-06-10T10:09:20  <smiley1983> I've got the grep of the logs in front of me now, I just need to find the link

2011-06-10T10:09:29  <smiley1983> yes, I copied your pattern
2011-06-10T10:09:35  <smiley1983> just made it graphical
2011-06-10T10:09:49  <smiley1983> because it was mentioned that the ascii is hard
2011-06-10T10:09:53  <stocha> from google i found this one.
2011-06-10T10:10:06  <stocha> yeah that was me. but i think i should update my brain rather :)
2011-06-10T10:10:39  <stocha> still it is good to have the picture ready for people
2011-06-10T10:10:55  <stocha> maybe you can post it in the forum or something once it's ready (and color blind proof :p)
2011-06-10T10:10:59  <carlop> yes, it's easier to understand i think
2011-06-10T10:11:09  <stocha> so people can link to it when needed
2011-06-10T10:11:26  <stocha> get rid of the litle ascii number though :p
2011-06-10T10:11:50  <stocha> and i don't think the A are really necessary
2011-06-10T10:12:00  <stocha> maybe only one, to show the attacker direction of heading

2011-06-10T12:48:05  <stocha> looking at this game http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=19457
2011-06-10T12:48:27  <stocha> i conclude that scoring system simply doesn't compensate for loosing more ants than the challenger
2011-06-10T12:49:10  <stocha> "fighting well" and much more score simply means nothing when you have fewer ants than you remaining neighbors
2011-06-10T12:49:48  <stocha> my conclusion is that the scoring system will never compensate the randomness of multiplayer.
2011-06-10T12:50:06  <george1914> carlop: hi, no, i am next to the food ...
2011-06-10T12:51:12  <amstan> stocha: do you have suggestions?
2011-06-10T12:53:33  <george1914> so i just took the c++ starter package, but set the bot to move West every move - it runs straight into a food square ...
2011-06-10T12:53:48  <george1914> on the visualiser, this spawns and ant, and the food goes away ...
2011-06-10T12:54:09  <stocha> only three at the moment : 1) cope with it. 2) make the game 1vs1 3) play each game several time, with all possible permutation of positions
2011-06-10T12:54:21  <george1914> but on the   State struct,  the food remains ...    whilst the spawned ant shows up once it has moved away ...
2011-06-10T12:55:51  <george1914> i ran:   ./playgame.py --seed 43 --end_wait=1.25 --verbose --log_dir game_logs --turns 10 --map_file maps/symmetric_maps/symmetric_11.map "$@" "python sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py" "python sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py" ./MyBot "python sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py"
2011-06-10T12:56:00  <smiley1983> antimatroid wrote the cpp starter, so when he notices the discussion he'll probably be able to help
2011-06-10T12:56:28  <george1914> ie map =  symm 11 + seed  = 43  +my bot was the 3rd one ...
2011-06-10T12:56:44  <george1914> ok, i'll keep looking in, thanks :)
2011-06-10T13:00:16  <stocha> amstan: 3) has the advantage of rendering assymetric map game more fair.
2011-06-10T13:00:46  <amstan> stocha: we don't have assymmetric maps
2011-06-10T13:01:11  <amstan> afaik
2011-06-10T13:01:18  <amstan> and if we did, i would be against it
2011-06-10T13:01:27  <carlop> george1914: i think that the food information should be modified after the call of updateVisionInformation, cause you want to set food=0 for every visible cell, and then maybe set to 1 if you see food, or something like this
2011-06-10T13:02:57  <carlop> maybe a solution is push in a vector every food information, set food = 0 for visible cell on updateVisionInfomation, then read the food information, set to 1 the cell
2011-06-10T13:03:36  <george1914> carlop:  hm, the strange thing is that everything works ok most of the time - in only <10% of games do i get this problem ...
2011-06-10T13:04:09  <george1914> so the starterbot is doing it 'almost' right ...
2011-06-10T13:04:26  <stocha> amstam: fact is map have assymetric player strength

2011-06-10T13:04:57  <carlop> yes, almost all the times the code should work, but maybe is better to correct it....
2011-06-10T13:08:46  <carlop> stocha: obviously play more game possible is the best solution to absorb every randomization (also play 1v1 switching position can give advantage to one of the player, if there is a fixed ordering like NSWE when two move seem equal), but replay more times the same map have another big problem: you are not randomizing your opponent.... so the best way is to play more game possible, each time...
2011-06-10T13:08:47  <carlop> ...with a different set of opponents and relative position
2011-06-10T13:09:32  <george1914> carlop:  ok, i'll wait and see what antimatroid says - i guess antimatroid can give definitive view, and then starter bot can be changed (if needed).   thanks for your replies.
2011-06-10T13:10:23  <stocha> carlop> i guess with enough games, you would be proved right.
2011-06-10T13:10:43  <stocha> same goes with all assymetry most probably
2011-06-10T13:10:51  <amstan> stocha: what?
2011-06-10T13:11:12  <stocha> amstan: playing enough game will compensate the assymetries

2011-06-10T13:13:29  <carlop> I think shocha's assymetries are starting near 2 top bot versus starting near a starting bot that don't fight with you, so maybe the same game can have different result for different positioning on the map
2011-06-10T13:13:58  <amstan> carlop: yes, that's maybe one of those things
2011-06-10T13:14:08  <amstan> i think it can be fixed by having at most 4 ppl per game
2011-06-10T13:15:29  <smiley1983> george1914: it has occurred to me that antimatroid may be asleep by now - it's 3:16 a.m here (I'm in the same time zone) and I think he said something about having exams
2011-06-10T13:15:59  <amstan> george1914: you could try fixing it yourself ;)
2011-06-10T13:21:48  <carlop> amstan: 4ppl reduce randomness, but I don't think is a mayor problem that the best bot can lose some match, cause after it will beat the variance over a large number of game
2011-06-10T13:22:00  <amstan> yes
2011-06-10T13:22:09  <amstan> but that still means adding some randomness
2011-06-10T13:22:25  <amstan> stocha: and no.. running games multiple times with same map same opponents is not an option
2011-06-10T13:23:24  <carlop> yes, is randomness vs more funny match, so maybe I think this issue can be investigated later, seeing what type of map (4ppl, 6pll, 8ppl) seem better in some sense
2011-06-10T13:27:02  <george1914> amstam:  so, i have fixed it (i think)...   1 line of code - BUT i dont fully follow the c++ code - seems it ought to already work ok from receiving an "r" message for removal of food - so i am slightly confused, and would prefer not to modify your code without someone else understanding what is up ...
2011-06-10T13:27:41  <amstan> ok
2011-06-10T13:27:47  <amstan> talk to antimatroid first then
2011-06-10T13:29:53  <carlop> george1914: now i've modified it too, i've added after line 219 of State.cc "state.grid[row][col].isFood = 0;", it should work, but tell to antimatroid in every case
2011-06-10T13:32:07  <george1914> carlop: yes, exactly what i changed.  but presumably there should ALSO be an "r" sent by the contest engine, which would make our 'fix' unneeded ...   ?
2011-06-10T13:36:05  <carlop> george1914: don't know, personally I think is unnecessary the "r" after a spawn, cause you have already this information, but the "r" line are redundant so don't know the exact logic behind this
2011-06-10T13:37:53  <george1914> carlop: you mean that the "r" is no longer part of the game standard?
2011-06-10T13:40:16  <carlop> don't know if the decision was to exclude the "r" line, but they are useless, so you can do a working bot without them (and discarding a line when begin with 'r')
2011-06-10T13:44:29  <george1914> carlop:  ok, i understand you.  yes, i guess so.   i was worried about:  a) c++ starterbot not correct, or b) game server messages not correct ...   i will ask antimatroid ...

2011-06-10T13:54:01  <guyverthree> anyone here tried turning on the debug in the C++ starter bot ???
2011-06-10T13:54:59  <amstan> guyverthree: umm, why are you so surprised?
2011-06-10T13:55:02  <amstan> what's the problem?
2011-06-10T13:55:50  <george1914> guyverthree: yes, i have
2011-06-10T13:55:53  <george1914> why?
2011-06-10T13:55:54  <guyverthree> habit i think
2011-06-10T13:56:11  <guyverthree> i am getting an unresolved external symbol on the << operator
2011-06-10T13:57:06  <guyverthree> bug.h is included in all the needed files but bot.obj won't link properly
2011-06-10T13:57:12  <george1914> well, i downloaded the c++ starterbot a few hours ago, using g++ to compile - i get complaint about 'NULL' somewhere, but that is all
2011-06-10T13:57:30  <guyverthree> i am using windows if that however
2011-06-10T13:57:34  <guyverthree> :(
2011-06-10T13:58:49  <guyverthree> i'll try getting it again
2011-06-10T13:58:56  <guyverthree> and doing a diff
2011-06-10T13:59:11  <amstan> i guess nobody really tested it on vc++, since we don't really use that
2011-06-10T13:59:23  <amstan> if you can fix it, we may include your fix on the website
2011-06-10T13:59:31  <smiley1983> george1914: I think I remember the situation with the c++ starter now: antimatroid hasn't uploaded the fix for the absent 'r' lines (which are indeed no longer part of the standard) because he's still trying to find a timing function which works in Windows.
2011-06-10T14:00:19  <guyverthree> i have a timer function
2011-06-10T14:00:55  <george1914> smiley1983: ah, right - i just read the 'game specification' webpage and it still says 'r' is sent ...
2011-06-10T14:01:08  <george1914> maybe another thing to edit/fix?
2011-06-10T14:01:38  <george1914> btw, sorry for my ignorance, but am i able to change/fix things?
2011-06-10T14:02:01  <carlop> i just create an issue on github: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/181, hope that is clear
2011-06-10T14:03:29  <george1914> ok, i will do that
2011-06-10T14:03:32  <smiley1983> I believe the contest organizers would be grateful for any help, particularly if you're familiar with Python or PHP - and everyone can report issues
2011-06-10T14:04:00  <smiley1983> Working on the contest code does not disqualify you from participating, though
2011-06-10T14:04:48  <george1914> i am familiar with neither, alas.
2011-06-10T14:05:27  <smiley1983> me also. I've just written a map generator in OCaml, but I'm not sure if it'll be used.
2011-06-10T14:05:45  <george1914> ... but i wondered if eg i can edit the 'game specification' page, rather than asking an organiser to do it ...
2011-06-10T14:06:16  <george1914> ...  maybe i should stick with  making githup issue
2011-06-10T14:06:48  <smiley1983> I'm not sure... amstan would know perhaps
2011-06-10T14:07:07  <amstan> george1914: what change?
2011-06-10T14:07:29  <smiley1983> the spec page still tells people to expect 'r' lines

2011-06-10T14:14:12  <george1914> i will submit github issue for editing the c++ starterbot ...
2011-06-10T14:14:46  <McLeopold> antimatroid: what is the big issue?
2011-06-10T14:15:01  <guyverthree> are R lines still being sent out from the game engine
2011-06-10T14:16:13  <McLeopold> they shouldn't be, I commented it out a few days ago
2011-06-10T14:17:05  <smiley1983> I think perhaps the c++ starter hasn't been updated to stop expecting them yet
2011-06-10T14:17:08  <george1914> but the c++ starterbot seems to expect them - and i get the wrong 'map' (it shows food, that is not there since it spawned to ants)
2011-06-10T14:18:24  <george1914> antimatroid: hi, good to see you - i found that the State struct in c++ starterbot was sometimes showing food that was not there ...
2011-06-10T14:20:47  <guyverthree> yeah i removed that from mine yesterday and still works fine
2011-06-10T14:21:00  <guyverthree> anyone know if you can overide the == operator in C++

2011-06-10T14:32:07  <guyverthree> I think i have figured out why the debug was not working

2011-06-10T14:32:48  <guyverthree> i don't think there is a override for the << in the state.h

2011-06-10T14:55:19  <carlop> McLeopold: few hours ago we had (me, antimatroid, stocha, others) a discussion about blocking problem, i think that are possible to block corridor forever (for attack2=4 width 4 corridor can be blocked, for attack2=5 width 6 corridor), so maybe this can be a big problem
2011-06-10T14:58:32  <carlop> antimatroid say to tell to you... cause is possible to almost block (and for the current map-set all) the map, degenerating the whole game
2011-06-10T15:00:44  <carlop> here there are some blocking scheme: http://pastebin.com/vTJjJfKk

2011-06-10T16:32:23  <mcstar> did you watch it?
2011-06-10T16:32:51  <carlop> i've see it, what's the problem ?
2011-06-10T16:33:35  <carlop> i don't think is so effective the diagonal block, cause you can broke it from the side
2011-06-10T16:34:02  <mcstar> if the darker blue steps to the coordinate i just said it would kill off one light blue
2011-06-10T16:34:07  <mcstar> yes
2011-06-10T16:34:27  <mcstar> why the hell is not doing it?
2011-06-10T16:34:32  <carlop> yes, or step line vs line with almost 1:1 kill/death
2011-06-10T16:35:13  <mcstar> ok, i thought for a moment i dont understand something
2011-06-10T16:35:43  <mcstar> and they changed the radii, but i was thinking with the old pattern in mind, and it didnt work
2011-06-10T16:36:10  <mcstar> and now this bot simply doesnt step there, but i was unsure of wth is going on
2011-06-10T16:36:32  <carlop> i think this solifugid's bot had some check that calculate each ant alone
2011-06-10T16:37:10  <carlop> so if you go against the lane alone you die, and he don't go
2011-06-10T16:37:30  <mcstar> i spotted a moment when one ant tries to attack alone
2011-06-10T16:38:55  <mcstar> turn 1753
2011-06-10T16:39:07  <mcstar> tile 101/52
2011-06-10T16:39:14  <mcstar> no that ypu should care
2011-06-10T16:39:29  <mcstar> well, all is right again
2011-06-10T16:42:06  <carlop> it's your bot solifugid ?
2011-06-10T16:43:08  <carlop> don't understand to the alone ant at turn 1753, but I think it's a bug caused by the food that the turn before spawned an ant
2011-06-10T16:43:44  <mcstar> its not mine
2011-06-10T16:43:50  <mcstar> mine is imagine
2011-06-10T16:44:05  <carlop> maybe there is something wrong in the parser code (something related with "r" row maybe)
2011-06-10T16:44:22  <mcstar> i spotted another kind of interesting situation
2011-06-10T16:44:27  <mcstar> lets call it zap
2011-06-10T16:44:44  <carlop> ok
2011-06-10T16:44:47  <mcstar> ill upload an image
2011-06-10T16:46:12  <mcstar> http://imgur.com/80h3I
2011-06-10T16:46:40  <mcstar> consider this, when two or more ants are coming together diagonally
2011-06-10T16:47:06  <mcstar> maybe one of them should be translated 1 tile up
2011-06-10T16:47:29  <mcstar> they can basically create a sitation from where anotehr ant cant escape
2011-06-10T16:47:32  <mcstar> it gets zapped

2011-06-10T16:56:34  <carlop> mcstar: the black tile are ant in the same tile that try to defend ?
2011-06-10T16:57:35  <mcstar> the reds are ants, the black is their respective attack-radius
2011-06-10T16:57:44  <carlop> ah, sorry
2011-06-10T16:57:53  <carlop> now, i've red the logs
2011-06-10T16:58:29  <mcstar> im thinking of 2x2 ant attack setups, its more interesting, ill think it through, but i think it can be done what i said when u rebooted
2011-06-10T17:00:59  <carlop> i'm not sure of your point
2011-06-10T17:01:56  <carlop> if the 2 ants are in the same team, and in the middle there is an enemy, he always die
2011-06-10T17:03:08  <carlop> but should be impossible to escape a 2v1 situation almost always, but in this case there is 1 death per side, that isn't a great improvement
2011-06-10T17:04:14  <carlop> a 2v1 situation is a "win" for the 2 side if they can kill without a single kill, but i'm not sure if this is doable against a good opponent
2011-06-10T17:04:55  <mcstar> thats why im considering when 2x2 ants attack 1 ant

2011-06-10T18:51:16  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold on the theory that the low draw probability was causing something to take too long to converge I tried a 5% draw probability, this did indeed keep jskills from crashing. I then modified jskills to try 1000 maximum iterations instead of 100, this seems to be working at a 1% draw probability. I'll let it run for a while and see how it goes before checking in the modified jskills version.
2011-06-10T18:51:16  <contestbot> janzert: As you wish.
