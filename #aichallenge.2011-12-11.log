2011-12-11T00:01:41  <janzert> McLeopold: btw, the change to make seed selection and insert one statement did help but not eliminate the problem, basically went from 17-20% down to 9-12%
2011-12-11T00:02:10  <janzert> I'll try and put together an external script to keep a buffer of matches soon
2011-12-11T00:03:13  <janzert> the only problem with that is we are getting close to the point where a pairing takes longer to produce than the speed we're using them
2011-12-11T00:05:21  <ChrisH_> janzert: thanks for the help, i'll check the code you emailed me to see what orders it outputs
2011-12-11T00:05:37  <McLeopold> janzert: ok

2011-12-11T00:45:45  <bmh> having been smacked around by bj_v5, I think it's time for combat code. Any suggestions?
2011-12-11T01:05:11  <antimatroid1> bmh: minimax :)
2011-12-11T01:06:26  <bmh> antimatroid1: I'm going to stick to monte carlo techniques
2011-12-11T01:06:55  <antimatroid1> do you know how i'm doing minimax?=
2011-12-11T01:07:08  <antimatroid1> it's like taking a tiny sample of the possible moves and running minimax on those
2011-12-11T01:07:17  <bmh> how about this: Consider all ants within combat radius 2. Pick an ant and tell everyone to move toward or away from that ant
2011-12-11T01:07:31  <antimatroid1> not very strategic :P
2011-12-11T01:07:41  <antimatroid1> and i don't like the combat + 2 thing
2011-12-11T01:07:48  <bmh> why?
2011-12-11T01:07:56  <antimatroid1> a..%b and a%..b
2011-12-11T01:07:59  <bmh> yeah yeah..
2011-12-11T01:08:12  <bmh> it isn't going to produce bad results
2011-12-11T01:08:23  <bmh> it could just be more expensive than optimal
2011-12-11T01:09:22  <antimatroid1> something i thinks worthwhile doing is working out the maximum enemies each location your ants can move into could possibly be within battle range next turn
2011-12-11T01:09:30  <antimatroid1> then minimise that or minimise positive that
2011-12-11T01:09:46  <antimatroid1> that's a bit of a mouthful :P
2011-12-11T01:10:31  <bmh> I really ought to have studied AI in university.
2011-12-11T01:10:44  <bmh> To all the kids out there: Take a machine learning class. You'll regret it if you don't.
2011-12-11T01:10:57  <antimatroid1> the "computing school" at my university is a joke, i would have done better taking more maths classes
2011-12-11T01:11:10  <antimatroid1> i did both the ai and machine learning classes, they were a joke :P
2011-12-11T01:11:24  <antimatroid1> i'm very tempted to do that stanford ml class though

2011-12-11T01:35:18  <ChrisH_> antimatroid1: how's your bot coming along?
2011-12-11T01:35:29  <antimatroid1> ChrisH_: not amazingly
2011-12-11T01:35:45  <antimatroid1> i'm just trying to get it functional to submit at this point :P
2011-12-11T01:36:00  <antimatroid1> and thinking about my battle stuff
2011-12-11T01:36:40  <ChrisH_> I will be interested to see how your battle code does when you get it going.
2011-12-11T01:37:11  <antimatroid1> ie. when evaluating a state, i'll add enemyDeaths-friendDeaths to the payoff, but i think something like 10*(eDeaths-fDeaths) + eDeaths/(fDeaths+1) might work better?
2011-12-11T01:37:43  <antimatroid1> ie. (eDeaths, fDeaths), (2,1) is better than (3,2) right?
2011-12-11T01:38:39  <ChrisH_> yeah, 2,1 is better than 3,2
2011-12-11T01:38:59  <ChrisH_> if you can achieve that each time there are casualties you come out with more in the end
2011-12-11T01:39:18  <ChrisH_> but 3,2 is better than a stalemate, so it's a balancing act
2011-12-11T01:39:35  <ChrisH_> between making progress and being too conservative
2011-12-11T01:41:46  <antimatroid1> yeah i know, just trying to work out how to order the outcomes properly
2011-12-11T01:41:55  <antimatroid1> i'm going to add in a third set of moves for each set of ants too
2011-12-11T01:42:05  <antimatroid1> which doesn't move into the attack radius of any current enemy locations

2011-12-11T01:50:06  <taeke> How does this work?
2011-12-11T01:50:27  <taeke> Is there anybody out there?
2011-12-11T01:50:31  <McLeopold> hi
2011-12-11T01:50:53  <taeke> Hi Leopold
2011-12-11T01:51:28  <taeke> I am looking for some answer about the current games on the servers
2011-12-11T01:51:40  <McLeopold> do  you have a bot submitted?
2011-12-11T01:51:42  <taeke> i see strange behavier
2011-12-11T01:51:59  <taeke> my bot playing two games on the same time
2011-12-11T01:52:17  <taeke> Yes i have a bot up and running
2011-12-11T01:53:09  <McLeopold> so, when scheduling games, often similar bots are chosen in a row, and you are more likely to be pulled into a games during that time
2011-12-11T01:54:13  <taeke> so you can end up playing in two games at the same time?
2011-12-11T01:54:18  <McLeopold> sure
2011-12-11T01:54:31  <taeke> i don't mind but had not seen that before
2011-12-11T01:54:37  <McLeopold> we have 25 servers now
2011-12-11T01:54:41  *** dvladim <dvladim!~dvladim@85.113.131.65> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-12-11T01:54:50  <McLeopold> each with 2-10 players
2011-12-11T01:55:12  <taeke> and somehow i don't regonise the behavier of my bot
2011-12-11T01:55:16  <McLeopold> potentially 50-250 players in a game at any one time
2011-12-11T01:55:34  <taeke> great
2011-12-11T01:55:36  <McLeopold> I always feel like that too
2011-12-11T01:55:39  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I posted on the forum about timeouts too
2011-12-11T01:55:44  <taeke> :) yeahh
2011-12-11T01:55:54  <McLeopold> BenJackson: better or worse with the new servers?
2011-12-11T01:55:55  <BenJackson> one game where I "timed out" against pguillory I downloaded the input and fed it to the same version locally
2011-12-11T01:55:56  <taeke> it isn't doing to bad
2011-12-11T01:56:05  <BenJackson> earlier turns in that same game took 5x longer to compute than the one that "timed out"
2011-12-11T01:56:21  <_flag> BenJackson: This happens to me ocassionally too
2011-12-11T01:56:22  <McLeopold> taeke: it looks like you pick random directions and just send ants in a straight line
2011-12-11T01:56:27  <BenJackson> nothing in the last 30 or so turns took more than 200ms on my machine, which is slower than the contest machines
2011-12-11T01:56:36  <_flag> Sometimes two players timeout in the same moves
2011-12-11T01:56:41  <_flag> same move*
2011-12-11T01:56:47  <_flag> Which is awfully suspicious
2011-12-11T01:56:49  <taeke> yeah but that is not the behavier i have locally
2011-12-11T01:57:13  <_flag> For example: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=179756&user=31
2011-12-11T01:57:26  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: Also re analyzing games, I was saying on irc earlier that my technique is basically to look at the number-of-ants graph and exmine the point where it diverges in favor of the ultimate winner
2011-12-11T01:57:30  <BenJackson> and try to see why it happened
2011-12-11T01:57:46  <ChrisH_> yeah
2011-12-11T01:57:46  <McLeopold> taeke: it looks like you submitted leftybot?
2011-12-11T01:58:25  <BenJackson> in one test game at home where the map had a hill near a dead end the winning bot ignored the initial food that was deeper in the dead end and went out instead
2011-12-11T01:58:25  <taeke> but that isn't the case and my result are also not matching lefty bot
2011-12-11T01:58:30  <BenJackson> leaving that food for a future ant
2011-12-11T01:58:42  <BenJackson> the losing bot moved backwards to the first food
2011-12-11T01:58:45  <BenJackson> everything followed from that
2011-12-11T01:58:53  <taeke> skill of 50 and up with lefty bot?
2011-12-11T01:59:05  <ChrisH_> I don't know if you saw my conversation with janzert earlier, but I had a game where my bot wasn't moving all of it's ants even early in the game. When I run it with that game input locally the orders are issued, but when janzert ran it on a worker he got the same results as the game replay showed, which is really scary to me.
2011-12-11T01:59:21  <BenJackson> wow
2011-12-11T01:59:40  <BenJackson> so your thing may not be timing
2011-12-11T01:59:47  <BenJackson> is your local system 32 or 64 bit?
2011-12-11T01:59:56  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: do you know if we was doing the ec2 instances or the new ones for that test?
2011-12-11T02:00:31  <McLeopold> BenJackson: do you ever look at the won at turn?
2011-12-11T02:00:54  <ChrisH_> no, but I did have one timeout recently that I posted in the forums about and that I think was a server thing, because my code is pretty good about not timing out.
2011-12-11T02:01:46  <BenJackson> McLeopold: on the aichallenge site I note it when I'm skimming over games to see how decisive they were
2011-12-11T02:01:47  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I don't know which kind of worker janzert tested that on, and I don't know which type the particular game ran on, but it was this game if you are interested: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=186986&user=10
2011-12-11T02:02:19  <taeke> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=188704&user=9213 is not lefty bot but http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=186506&user=9213 looks like lefty bot but is is all version 28
2011-12-11T02:02:33  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: the worker id should be in the replay, we can trace that to the worker ip, which would probably let us know the type
2011-12-11T02:03:32  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: my local system is 32 bit, but Go should make that a non-issue, unless it is due to a difference in the 32 bit or 64 compiler, the language itself doesn't allow implicit conversions between different bit numbers, so it is all explicit.
2011-12-11T02:04:17  <BenJackson> oh Go
2011-12-11T02:04:28  <BenJackson> I guess a compiler issue is an order of magnitude more likely with Go than with, say, C++
2011-12-11T02:04:35  <ChrisH_> yes
2011-12-11T02:04:47  <BenJackson> I have to remind myself of that when I use GCC on obscure architectures
2011-12-11T02:05:58  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: that game was worker_id 661 at ip 77.95.X.X, which is a new worker
2011-12-11T02:06:00  <ChrisH_> but the behavior of my bot in the weird game was consistent with it either thinking it had less time left in the turn than reality (but janzert's test pretty much refuted that) or that it was occassionally dropping the last few ant orders on the floor before they get sent.
2011-12-11T02:06:26  <ChrisH_> and then the next turn it would work
2011-12-11T02:06:42  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: so, you have to send a go line after all orders
2011-12-11T02:06:43  <BenJackson> did it emit the stale order right at the start of the NEXT turn?
2011-12-11T02:06:51  <ChrisH_> there was a stretch of about 15 turns (around 130, still early in the game) where several ants just didn't move
2011-12-11T02:07:06  <ChrisH_> no, the order just didn't happen
2011-12-11T02:07:28  <BenJackson> unfortunately the way my bot works it isn't really possible to stop computing orders early
2011-12-11T02:07:36  <ChrisH_> and my bot doesn't cache any orders, paths or any info about ants between turns either
2011-12-11T02:07:38  <McLeopold> how many ways can your bot skip to the go line?
2011-12-11T02:07:47  <ChrisH_> one
2011-12-11T02:07:54  <BenJackson> and given the way I timed out one time on the official site it must have been in a way my bot didn't even run
2011-12-11T02:08:35  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: could it be something to do with how the sandboxing code affects the runtime?
2011-12-11T02:08:45  <taeke> McLeopold could you take a look at http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=188704&user=9213 and http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=186506&user=9213 same version but tottaly different behavier the latest does not look like my bot the first does but it is all version 28
2011-12-11T02:08:47  <ChrisH_> all orders are collected in one structure and held there until there is nothing left to do or time is up, then a three line function loops to send the orders and when that returns the final "go" is sent
2011-12-11T02:08:52  <BenJackson> I don't know how feasible it is for someone to run under an equivalent sandbox
2011-12-11T02:10:52  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: have any of my other games run on server 661?
2011-12-11T02:11:21  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: let me check...
2011-12-11T02:11:40  <McLeopold> taeke: those are both submission 32527, there is no way we run the wrong bots
2011-12-11T02:13:21  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: game ids 186986 and 188450
2011-12-11T02:13:27  <BenJackson> the behavior isn't that obviously different
2011-12-11T02:13:52  <McLeopold> for taeke, no, especially the first turn pause and bounce after hitting a wall
2011-12-11T02:15:32  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: 186986 is the weird game, 188450 is my most recent one and there are no apparent problems with that one, in fact my bot dominated that matchup
2011-12-11T02:15:38  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: I don't think I see static ants in the second game
2011-12-11T02:15:53  <ChrisH_> no, it looks perfect to me
2011-12-11T02:16:17  <McLeopold> maybe more ants makes you go faster :)
2011-12-11T02:16:17  <ChrisH_> in fact, I had already checked it but didn't know it was the same server as the other one.
2011-12-11T02:16:24  <ChrisH_> LOL, I wish
2011-12-11T02:16:53  <ChrisH_> the only static ants in the second game are late and it is normal for my bot in that version
2011-12-11T02:17:13  <ChrisH_> too many ants and I hadn't seen the last enemy hill yet
2011-12-11T02:17:19  <ChrisH_> so they had nothing to do
2011-12-11T02:17:44  <McLeopold> I'm wondering if unseeable water would kill my bot
2011-12-11T02:17:59  <McLeopold> I think they might all surround the lake...
2011-12-11T02:18:35  <ChrisH_> trying to explore the middle?
2011-12-11T02:18:49  <McLeopold> yeah, I should run a test
2011-12-11T02:19:00  <McLeopold> it might break my path finding
2011-12-11T02:19:06  <ChrisH_> my bot would put a goal in there, but since there is not path to it the ants would ignore it
2011-12-11T02:19:18  <BenJackson> I've seen my current bot do stupid things when a stalemate is blocking explorable area
2011-12-11T02:19:49  <BenJackson> I actually restructured my pathing so I could do things like avoid stalemate areas
2011-12-11T02:19:56  <BenJackson> but never did
2011-12-11T02:19:58  <ChrisH_> Has anyone seen bots controlling ant spawning by standing on their own hills?
2011-12-11T02:20:01  <McLeopold> I think I would need to detect no path spots and mark them water
2011-12-11T02:20:10  <McLeopold> no
2011-12-11T02:20:21  <McLeopold> but I've seen some maps where it would help
2011-12-11T02:20:52  <bmh> ChrisH_: I thought Xathis does it
2011-12-11T02:20:55  <ChrisH_> Yeah, me too, so I've coded it up and it's mostly working, but I haven't run enough tests yet to decide if I'll keep it.
2011-12-11T02:21:05  <McLeopold> when do you do it?
2011-12-11T02:21:20  <ChrisH_> well, that's the interesting part isn't it.
2011-12-11T02:21:20  *** epicmonkey <epicmonkey!~epicmonke@178.130.5.103> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-11T02:21:37  <BenJackson> I did implement code to keep track of my hive
2011-12-11T02:21:49  <BenJackson> but usually if I have ants in my hive I'm fine
2011-12-11T02:21:53  <ChrisH_> the goal is to spawn ants as close to targets as possible to avoid wasting the time traveling from the "wrong" hill
2011-12-11T02:21:54  <BenJackson> I get screwed on maps with no food
2011-12-11T02:22:25  <ChrisH_> but I also don't want to leave any ants in the hive if it can be avoided
2011-12-11T02:22:39  <taeke> McLeopold: Ok thanks. It must be me looking at it the wrong way. Thanks for the information.
2011-12-11T02:22:40  <ChrisH_> and the resulting code started to remind me of the future state tracking I did for PW.
2011-12-11T02:22:58  <BenJackson> I didn't realize how bursty food was until I saw how bursty hive depth was and then looked into why
2011-12-11T02:22:59  <McLeopold> yeah, I'm totally reusing PW code :)
2011-12-11T02:23:22  *** bmh <bmh!ada4e181@fsf/member/bmh> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-12-11T02:23:49  <BenJackson> I like implementing things like hive counting and symmetry detection because it's something I can solve
2011-12-11T02:23:58  <BenJackson> whereas balancing my strategy heuristics is open ended
2011-12-11T02:24:16  <BenJackson> and currently my tweaking has made a bot which loses 100% of the time to my last bot in some situations
2011-12-11T02:24:29  <ChrisH_> the only concern I have is that it means I have to leave an ant on each of my hills to control the spawning, but the bonus is that none of my hills can get ambushed and I can spawn defenses there faster as well
2011-12-11T02:25:02  <ChrisH_> all assuming a multi-hill map of course
2011-12-11T02:25:06  <McLeopold> if you are that worried, then you are trying to control 1 ant spawn, probably not worth it
2011-12-11T02:25:36  <McLeopold> after you get a bunch of food, just pick a hill closest to the good stuff, then don't move the new ants off the others
2011-12-11T02:25:51  <ChrisH_> i think it will be an advantage in some cases, but not sure how much of an advantage
2011-12-11T02:26:05  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: that's what I'm hoping will happen
2011-12-11T02:26:15  <McLeopold> there is a cell maze that I need to find...
2011-12-11T02:26:21  <BenJackson> my "solution" to this is to not worry about my worst hills being taken in multi-hill
2011-12-11T02:26:21  <ChrisH_> also, I think my bot does better with fewer hills
2011-12-11T02:26:38  <BenJackson> if I have a hill near/between a strong enemy better to let it die than feed ants into a bottleneck
2011-12-11T02:26:55  <ChrisH_> that was my solution back when I had a "static" defense

2011-12-11T02:27:17  <BenJackson> what is driving me nuts about my bot is that my "active" defense lets things by
2011-12-11T02:27:20  <BenJackson> it doesn't die
2011-12-11T02:27:25  <BenJackson> it just turns sideways and slips past
2011-12-11T02:27:31  <ChrisH_> and I'm willing to allow that to happen still, but we'll see how it goes, i need to get this code tested and then upload it to see how it does

2011-12-11T02:37:32  <McLeopold> its not the one I was looking for
2011-12-11T02:38:06  <ChrisH_> but I think the situation can come up dynamically as well when you have one hill deep in your own area and another closer to the front lines or an enemy hill.
2011-12-11T02:38:08  <McLeopold> its a map where you have 3 hills in front of a large snaking cave and 1 hill on the other side of the map that is surrounded
2011-12-11T02:38:17  <McLeopold> it is a cell_maps, I think at least 4 players
2011-12-11T02:39:14  <McLeopold> at least in the map I found, you have a hill inside a cave, which can just be blocked
2011-12-11T02:41:00  <ChrisH_> this map could be like that:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=166036
2011-12-11T02:41:07  <McLeopold> no
2011-12-11T02:41:35  <McLeopold> there was a main channel that had a slightly negative slope everyone had to fight over
2011-12-11T02:41:36  <ChrisH_> no not it, but one hill out in the open and other inside a horseshoe could lead to interesting spawning strategies
2011-12-11T02:43:29  <McLeopold> that's a crazy map
2011-12-11T02:44:17  <ChrisH_> yeah, and that was a crazy game, one of the few "good games" I posted in the forums
2011-12-11T02:45:42  <McLeopold> my pathfinding would explorer from the center of a lake (if unseen) and stop at the water, and then quit.  so I think I'll lose 5ms in a game for maps that have those

2011-12-11T02:47:45  <ChrisH_> not an issue, and it's not the total time lost during the game that matters, but the maximum time lost on any single turn that really matters
2011-12-11T02:53:17  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: how many ants to you commit to razing a hill?

2011-12-11T02:54:19  <ChrisH_> I commit at least 3 plus any ants with nothing else to do
2011-12-11T02:54:28  <ChrisH_> why
2011-12-11T02:54:29  <ChrisH_> ?
2011-12-11T02:54:58  <McLeopold> I'm working on a formula
2011-12-11T02:55:08  <McLeopold> I started with 2 and added more if needed
2011-12-11T02:55:52  <ChrisH_> the thing is, my bot also attacks enemy ants, so the more there are around the enemy hill, the more ants I send, plus the 3
2011-12-11T02:56:09  <McLeopold> that was how I was deciding to add more
2011-12-11T02:56:15  <janzert> ChrisH_: so the test I did earlier was on one of the new workers
2011-12-11T02:56:29  <ChrisH_> janzert: ok
2011-12-11T02:56:29  <janzert> just repeated it on one of the old workers with the same result though
2011-12-11T02:56:34  <ChrisH_> ok
2011-12-11T02:57:01  <janzert> while I'm sure it's worse for you, I'm rather relieved ;)
2011-12-11T02:57:17  <ChrisH_> I haven't seen this happening a lot, so I'm not going to worry about it now, my next version has changed enough hopefully it won't happen when I resubmit

2011-12-11T03:01:14  <BenJackson> oh god how did this get here I am not good with computer
2011-12-11T03:02:46  <ChrisH_> the amazing thing is that I tied for 1st in that game anyway, but my last hill was under serious attack and I lost the ant count war when the turn limit hit, so I easily could have lost if the game had gone another few turns, but even tying for 1st my mu went down because the competition all had lower mu's
2011-12-11T03:03:19  <BenJackson> do you actually estimate scores while playing?
2011-12-11T03:03:25  <ChrisH_> so, i did ok even with a couple fingers tied behind my back
2011-12-11T03:03:41  <ChrisH_> no, i have no idea how to do that accurately.
2011-12-11T03:04:07  <BenJackson> I don't think it's possible
2011-12-11T03:04:27  <BenJackson> you'd have to do serious work just to know for sure how many players there were
2011-12-11T03:05:09  <janzert> ChrisH_: mu went down because you tied with a lower mu
2011-12-11T03:05:24  <ChrisH_> you could play a whole game and not see all the players
2011-12-11T03:05:31  <BenJackson> ie me
2011-12-11T03:05:35  <ChrisH_> janzert: yes, I understand, not a complaint
2011-12-11T03:05:53  <BenJackson> recent game, I tie chrish for 4th, 2 games back (for me) he wins and I come in last
2011-12-11T03:05:59  <BenJackson> that is basically the problem with V10 of my bot
2011-12-11T03:06:04  <BenJackson> it's a bit... bi-modal
2011-12-11T03:07:38  <ChrisH_> i think you see that for a lot of bots when they are playing roughly equal competition
2011-12-11T03:08:27  <ChrisH_> the margin for error in a game can be pretty slim sometimes
2011-12-11T03:09:18  <BenJackson> at some point this week I may have to knuckle down and quit playing with new ideas and just do another bugfix pass

2011-12-11T08:00:06  <lilEzek> anyone can help me with an easy task?
2011-12-11T08:00:39  <lilEzek> I would like to determine the direction an ant should take to get close to another point
2011-12-11T08:00:54  <lilEzek> and I can't handle torus
2011-12-11T08:01:34  <lilEzek> I mean, given two points, determine the direction that should the first point take to get close to second point

2011-12-11T08:04:14  <Anilm3> lilEzek: you realize that if you don't use pathfinding your ant can get stuck right?
2011-12-11T08:04:30  <lilEzek> I know
2011-12-11T08:04:35  <lilEzek> I use bfs
2011-12-11T08:04:50  <Anilm3> if you use bfs you have stored the direction
2011-12-11T08:04:53  <Anilm3> or the path
2011-12-11T08:05:01  <lilEzek> I'm storing a stack of steps
2011-12-11T08:05:17  <Anilm3> follow the steps then
2011-12-11T08:05:19  <lilEzek> that is, a stack<Location> in c++ STL
2011-12-11T08:05:23  <lilEzek> yeah
2011-12-11T08:05:32  <lilEzek> but I need a function that
2011-12-11T08:05:35  <Anilm3> In my case
2011-12-11T08:05:41  <lilEzek> pointsToDirection(Location,Location)
2011-12-11T08:05:43  <Anilm3> I use A*
2011-12-11T08:05:46  <lilEzek> to know the direction to follow
2011-12-11T08:05:47  <Anilm3> and get the whole path
2011-12-11T08:06:21  <Anilm3> I have a BFS for the purpose of exploration and for that I just store the direction
2011-12-11T08:06:39  <Anilm3> so when I find the interesting node on the BFS I just go to that direction
2011-12-11T08:07:01  <lilEzek> yeah
2011-12-11T08:07:04  <lilEzek> I imagine so
2011-12-11T08:07:24  <lilEzek> the problem is I'm not storing all the locations on the stack
2011-12-11T08:07:27  <Anilm3> in your case I think you would have to reconstruct the path or store it on each node
2011-12-11T08:07:46  <lilEzek> imagine I need to go from 1,0 to 200,0
2011-12-11T08:07:56  <lilEzek> if no obstacle is in the path
2011-12-11T08:08:02  <lilEzek> the stack only stores 1,0 and 200,0
2011-12-11T08:08:10  <lilEzek> because I can deduce the direction
2011-12-11T08:08:14  <Anilm3> the first step of the bresenham line algorithm
2011-12-11T08:08:25  <lilEzek> bresenham line algorithm?
2011-12-11T08:08:28  <Anilm3> yup
2011-12-11T08:08:32  <Anilm3> google it
2011-12-11T08:08:54  <lilEzek> what does it gives?
2011-12-11T08:08:57  <lilEzek> what does it give?
2011-12-11T08:09:10  <Anilm3> it's an algorith to draw a line on a screen of pixels
2011-12-11T08:09:32  <Anilm3> in this case you adapt it to draw a line without diagonal moves
2011-12-11T08:09:42  <Anilm3> and since no obstacles are in the way
2011-12-11T08:09:45  <lilEzek> the problem is I'm in a torus
2011-12-11T08:09:58  <lilEzek> so I can't get two points and draw that line
2011-12-11T08:10:08  <lilEzek> because it could not be the path the BFS calculated
2011-12-11T08:10:42  <lilEzek> BFS get the shortest path
2011-12-11T08:10:44  <Anilm3> then use the BFS path dude
2011-12-11T08:10:48  <Anilm3> ...
2011-12-11T08:10:56  <lilEzek> sorry if you are not understanding
2011-12-11T08:11:09  <lilEzek> my BFS returns a stack of paths
2011-12-11T08:11:13  <lilEzek> sorry, a stack of points
2011-12-11T08:11:28  <lilEzek> that I should follow in straight line
2011-12-11T08:11:29  <Anilm3> the next point
2011-12-11T08:11:33  <Anilm3> from your actual point
2011-12-11T08:11:38  <lilEzek> not the next point
2011-12-11T08:11:53  <lilEzek> the last point I can follow in a straight line before changing direction
2011-12-11T08:12:21  <Anilm3> ok
2011-12-11T08:12:28  <Anilm3> so that point would be
2011-12-11T08:12:35  <lilEzek> in a normal bfs it returns 1,0 -> 2,0 -> 3,0 -> ... 200,0
2011-12-11T08:12:38  <Anilm3> the difference between initial-last
2011-12-11T08:12:46  <Anilm3> would be (dX, dY)
2011-12-11T08:13:08  <Anilm3> if you're going on a straight line (N, S, E, W)
2011-12-11T08:13:21  <Anilm3> that difference will have either dX or dY equal to 0
2011-12-11T08:13:37  <lilEzek> yes
2011-12-11T08:14:03  <Anilm3> divide that difference between the norm of the vector (the distance between the two points)
2011-12-11T08:14:34  <lilEzek> which vector?
2011-12-11T08:14:40  <Anilm3> and you will get (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)
2011-12-11T08:14:42  <lilEzek> the distance?
2011-12-11T08:14:46  <Anilm3> yup
2011-12-11T08:14:52  <Anilm3> so you know where you have to go
2011-12-11T08:15:19  <lilEzek> even if it is a torus?
2011-12-11T08:15:27  <Anilm3> ||p0-p1||
2011-12-11T08:15:40  <Anilm3> I'm not sure
2011-12-11T08:15:52  <lilEzek> the problem is that the world is a torus
2011-12-11T08:15:58  <Anilm3> wait
2011-12-11T08:16:02  <lilEzek> ok
2011-12-11T08:16:07  <lilEzek> by the way, thank you
2011-12-11T08:16:55  <Anilm3> have a look at the distance function
2011-12-11T08:17:04  <Anilm3> it does some math trick to deal with the torus
2011-12-11T08:17:07  <Anilm3> just do the same thing
2011-12-11T08:17:21  <Anilm3> I don't know

2011-12-11T08:22:56  <AntDroid> lol. i have a feeling it's flagcapper
2011-12-11T08:23:48  <AntDroid> fast games now on aichallenge server but my bot is paired with a lot of one-on-one match so descent to higher rank is slow
2011-12-11T08:24:01  <pairofdice> That's the opposite
2011-12-11T08:24:09  <pairofdice> Duels affect the rank the most
2011-12-11T08:25:13  <AntDroid> well, i notice in my games that if my bot won against many opponents that the skill increased considerably
2011-12-11T08:26:01  <AntDroid> it might depend on the quality of the opponent though, be it one-on-one or against many opponents
2011-12-11T08:26:03  <pairofdice> There's a few more variables at play
2011-12-11T08:27:14  <AntDroid> i'm thinking that since there are a lot of servers now that there are only a few remaining bots at that level to play with so there are a lot of one-on-one matches
2011-12-11T08:29:26  <pairofdice> Yeah, that makes no sence either.
2011-12-11T08:29:30  <pairofdice> sense?
2011-12-11T08:30:34  <lilEzek> it is possible to challenge another player?
2011-12-11T08:31:47  <AntDroid> i don't think so. that could have been a cool feature.
2011-12-11T08:32:07  <ronchaine> Well, it is kinda possible if you just send your bot to the other player.
2011-12-11T08:33:07  <AntDroid> or you could play on a tcpserver where their are only a few bots so there's a big chance that you'll be paired most of the time

2011-12-11T11:16:11  <u_> my bfs takes 150 ms to find a 65-long path
2011-12-11T11:16:16  <u_> is that acceptable
2011-12-11T11:16:44  <thestinger> no
2011-12-11T11:16:52  <thestinger> probably not working right
2011-12-11T11:18:40  <thestinger> I use multi-source BFS to make distance maps (so they fill a 2d int array with distance values, to get paths/distances for every tile to a target) - takes ~0.1ms for one target
2011-12-11T11:19:12  <thestinger> ~1ms if I put 7k targets on the search queue at the start (putting more actually makes it faster)
2011-12-11T11:19:13  <pairofdice> Either not working right or Python
2011-12-11T11:19:19  <pairofdice> ;p
2011-12-11T11:19:22  <thestinger> no, it's still fast in python
2011-12-11T11:19:50  <thestinger> in pypy it would only be ~10x slower than C if you were using array.array and a deque for the fifo
2011-12-11T11:20:31  <thestinger> I think pypy actually optimizes a list of things -> a packed array of them if it can figure out that's all you do anyway
2011-12-11T11:20:46  <thestinger> well a python 'list' is an array of pointers to things :P
2011-12-11T11:20:50  <thestinger> array.array is packed

2011-12-11T14:21:46  <BenJackson> it's less like he min-maxes fights and more like he plans in advance what formation to take
2011-12-11T14:21:51  <Fluxid> bmh: i try to do something like payoff matrix

2011-12-11T14:23:21  <bmh> While taking a shower I had an idea that I think can improve on the monte carlo approaches.
2011-12-11T14:24:04  <bmh> This is clearly obvious: It seems that you either want to move your ants toward an enemy ant or away from it.
2011-12-11T14:25:10  <bmh> So grab an ant, and find an enemy within (combatRadius + n), and then nudge the move probabilities of nearby ants to either 1) move toward that enemy or 2) away from it

2011-12-11T14:26:26  <bmh> Compute a score* for 1 & 2 and permanently update the distributions of the nearby ants according to whichever is superior
2011-12-11T14:26:55  <roflmao> i do payoff matrix myself
2011-12-11T14:27:01  <roflmao> but it gets tricky
2011-12-11T14:27:09  <roflmao> i mean the concept is solid imo
2011-12-11T14:27:25  <roflmao> but the approach you take MUST be more nuanced than just comparing the min values on the payoff matrix
2011-12-11T14:27:49  <roflmao> bmh: yeah that's basically a payoff matrix
2011-12-11T14:27:56  <roflmao> but it's a little more complicated than just that
2011-12-11T14:28:01  <roflmao> because you want to get the positioning right
2011-12-11T14:28:41  <bmh> roflmao: I think it's strictly dumber than a payoff matrix because I'm just jittering the universe until the distributions produce good results
2011-12-11T14:28:59  <roflmao> it might actually be better -.-
2011-12-11T14:29:04  <roflmao> err I meant :)
2011-12-11T14:29:34  <BenJackson> bmh: not having read your proposal in detail it sounds like you are reinventing Simulated Annealing
2011-12-11T14:29:45  <thestinger> meh, distracted by coding other stuff now xD
2011-12-11T14:29:53  <thestinger> metasploit is too fun :(
2011-12-11T14:29:56  <bmh> BenJackson: that sounds accurate ;)
2011-12-11T14:29:56  <BenJackson> which is essentially how I do what a1k0n described but without dirchlet distributions
2011-12-11T14:30:31  <BenJackson> simulated annealing is very easy
2011-12-11T14:31:19  <BenJackson> basically it's:  try something "close" to what you are doing now (maybe one ant move changes) and score that
2011-12-11T14:31:27  <BenJackson> if that's the best score ever, note it
2011-12-11T14:31:50  <BenJackson> if it's a "good enough score" to keep working on (that's where the magic of simulated annealing comes in) then continue
2011-12-11T14:31:54  <BenJackson> otherwise undo that move and continue
2011-12-11T14:32:22  <BenJackson> early on "good enough" to keep working on is almost anything including getting much worse
2011-12-11T14:32:33  <roflmao> i should try that
2011-12-11T14:32:42  <roflmao> i just have a payoff matrix of offense defense
2011-12-11T14:32:45  <BenJackson> but slowly as you "reduce the temperature" you accept less and less worse moves
2011-12-11T14:32:46  <roflmao> for both me and enemy
2011-12-11T14:32:48  <BenJackson> and then only better moves
2011-12-11T14:33:23  <BenJackson> you should go read a more formal description of it because the selection has a mathematical basis I'm glossing over
2011-12-11T14:35:26  <roflmao> sucks there's not that much time left
2011-12-11T14:35:29  <bmh> roflmao: does your payoff matrix consider "distance from my hill" and "distance to their hill"?
2011-12-11T14:35:59  <roflmao> nope but it was something i was considering adding
2011-12-11T14:36:05  <roflmao> cause one of the problems is that I'd get boxed in
2011-12-11T14:36:38  <roflmao> i mean if I only had more time
2011-12-11T14:36:44  <roflmao> I could really refine my newfound working combat system
2011-12-11T14:36:48  <roflmao> (because it works, its solid)
2011-12-11T14:36:51  <roflmao> but not enough time :(
2011-12-11T14:37:01  <roflmao> i have like 4-5 things I need to do
2011-12-11T14:37:41  <Fluxid> okay, i'm uploading and approaching combat once more
2011-12-11T14:38:01  <roflmao> good luck :)
2011-12-11T14:39:22  <bmh> For payoffs, I was considering: Killing enemy ants is more valuable near your hill, losing your own ants is more valuable near their hill. I suspect that has the potential to go horribly wrong

2011-12-11T14:45:29  <roflmao> my current bot uses a nudger of 1.1
2011-12-11T14:47:01  <bmh> roflmao: hrm, I think you want to be less aggressive than that.
2011-12-11T14:47:14  <roflmao> i thought so too
2011-12-11T14:47:19  <roflmao> which is why i used *2 initially
2011-12-11T14:47:20  <bmh> er, misread that
2011-12-11T14:47:29  <roflmao> i changed that to 1.1 and my skill jumped up 5 points on tcp
2011-12-11T14:47:54  <bmh> I need to buckle down today and actually implement combat.
2011-12-11T14:48:15  <roflmao> you can get a basic payoff matrix working relatively easily
2011-12-11T14:48:16  <bmh> I also need to tell my ants to go for food closest to the armistice line before eating safe food
2011-12-11T14:48:37  <roflmao> err no i would not do that
2011-12-11T14:48:45  <roflmao> obv give it a try
2011-12-11T14:48:53  <roflmao> but the key to having good combat is having a SOLID formation
2011-12-11T14:49:04  <roflmao> your ants have to organize all evenly
2011-12-11T14:49:17  <roflmao> that's why pguillory rules cause his formation is downright perfect
2011-12-11T14:49:33  <roflmao> if the ants on your frontline are dancing around to get the nearby food
2011-12-11T14:49:38  <roflmao> then your formation is going to get screwed up
2011-12-11T14:49:43  <roflmao> at least that's what I've experienced
2011-12-11T14:51:10  <bmh> oh, no. I won't do something so daft. I'm thinking of the case: b...%..a.%

2011-12-11T15:04:26  <BenJackson> v8 and v9 were retired pretty fast
2011-12-11T15:04:36  <UncleVasya> Maybe v7 is enough.
2011-12-11T15:04:38  <BenJackson> (v6 didn't build on the aichallenge server due to compiler version difference)
2011-12-11T15:04:46  <BenJackson> v10 is a lot better than v7
2011-12-11T15:05:00  <Dlayne> sounds like engine types
2011-12-11T15:05:04  <BenJackson> v7 still only knows about getting advantage in combat, not exactly who lives and dies

2011-12-11T15:05:38  <BenJackson> if V10 charges into V7 then 7 gets a bit wide and 10 gets much wider and V7 is destroyed about as fast as V4 vs V5

2011-12-11T15:06:31  <BenJackson> I just mean that V7 was maximizing the condition that EITHER an enemy is attacked by 0 of my ants OR 2 or more
2011-12-11T15:06:36  <BenJackson> since 1 would be a tie
2011-12-11T15:06:55  <BenJackson> same with all my combat before V8
2011-12-11T15:07:05  <BenJackson> you can see how it's unwilling to trade 1 for 1 but it will trade 2 for 2
2011-12-11T15:07:13  <roflmao> ah
2011-12-11T15:07:22  <roflmao> i solve that problem with a small multiplier on my score
2011-12-11T15:07:28  <roflmao> but I'm not willing to trade 2 for 2
2011-12-11T15:07:31  <roflmao> :P
2011-12-11T15:07:36  <BenJackson> V8+ will see that 2 for 2 is also a trade and not attack until it's better
2011-12-11T15:07:45  <roflmao> ah
2011-12-11T15:07:47  <roflmao> which is what you want, right?
2011-12-11T15:07:50  <roflmao> you don't want to trade
2011-12-11T15:07:55  <BenJackson> mostly yes
2011-12-11T15:08:18  <BenJackson> looking at xathis I think you could really fuck up xathis if you were willing to do big trades
2011-12-11T15:08:24  <BenJackson> he's very efficient at making single layer defenses
2011-12-11T15:08:33  <roflmao> i was thinking of adding density
2011-12-11T15:08:39  <BenJackson> and all the top ants dutifully hold their ground 3 spaces away
2011-12-11T15:08:39  <roflmao> based on the combat islands

2011-12-11T15:09:57  <roflmao> kind of like 300 vs the persians
2011-12-11T15:10:09  <BenJackson> yeah, because no one is looking through to see the advantage of just killing his front line
2011-12-11T15:10:13  <pairofdice> Yeah, you're willing to trade you could push lines much of the time

2011-12-11T15:10:31  <roflmao> i think that's a problem a lot of the bots currently have
2011-12-11T15:10:36  <BenJackson> that's one thing that makes it hard to rise through the ranks
2011-12-11T15:10:39  <roflmao> that wouldn't be too hard to fix with some simple checks and balances
2011-12-11T15:10:46  <BenJackson> at the top everyone avoids trading ants which works out fine
2011-12-11T15:10:54  <BenJackson> in the mid level where ants are "blind" they will suicide you
2011-12-11T15:10:59  <BenJackson> which is bad for both of you
2011-12-11T15:11:04  <roflmao> haha yes!
2011-12-11T15:11:21  <BenJackson> that's why at home I test against several versions of my ants
2011-12-11T15:11:25  <Fluxid> ok, first game: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=195741&user=757
2011-12-11T15:11:29  <BenJackson> including the blind/greedy ones
2011-12-11T15:11:32  <Fluxid> it could be better
2011-12-11T15:11:37  <BenJackson> that's fast

2011-12-11T15:13:48  <roflmao> and resolving combat inside those islands?
2011-12-11T15:13:50  <Fluxid> yeah, i was afraid that it could be something nasty in my bot but they did timeout many times before
2011-12-11T15:13:57  <roflmao> right now I just resolve combat for attackradius+1 of each enemy ant
2011-12-11T15:14:11  <BenJackson> roflmao: my algorithm is something like quadratic in the number of ants
2011-12-11T15:14:13  <roflmao> which leads to a lot of needless overlap of course but meh i have plenty of time left
2011-12-11T15:14:17  <BenJackson> so I break into islands for performance
2011-12-11T15:14:22  <BenJackson> you get some metadata too

2011-12-11T15:14:31  <BenJackson> when I did it globally I couldn't tell where I was outnumbered locally
2011-12-11T15:14:40  <roflmao> well I do it locally
2011-12-11T15:14:44  <roflmao> but locally to each enemy ant
2011-12-11T15:14:49  <roflmao> and their attackradius+1
2011-12-11T15:14:56  <BenJackson> I find all ants that are in combat
2011-12-11T15:15:08  <BenJackson> then use a connected area coloring to group them
2011-12-11T15:15:28  <BenJackson> then I collect the groups
2011-12-11T15:15:31  <BenJackson> and resolve combat in each group

2011-12-11T15:15:49  <roflmao> that's what I want to do, I know how, but it involves some coding and time is short
2011-12-11T15:15:52  <BenJackson> it helped a lot on some of those 190x190 open cell maps
2011-12-11T15:15:59  <BenJackson> where I'd be in 50 1v1 combats all over
2011-12-11T15:16:13  <BenJackson> I could optimize the 1v1 case pretty easily too
2011-12-11T15:16:18  <BenJackson> but I never did
2011-12-11T15:16:21  <roflmao> I don't care about performance since it's not an issue but I'm wondering if it will make my bot any better
2011-12-11T15:16:24  <roflmao> in its fighting skills

2011-12-11T15:16:38  <BenJackson> other than being able to direct more ants to local problems

2011-12-11T15:50:13  <nha> when I fixed that bug, things got worse because of that, now I try to randomly be more aggressive based on number of my vs. enemy ants
2011-12-11T15:50:53  <BenJackson> same thing happened to me

2011-12-11T17:34:34  <BenJackson> my bot is bouncing around 11-13 and it has 103 games
2011-12-11T17:35:09  <BenJackson> I have the same score as RVeerdonk to the nearest 100th
2011-12-11T17:35:11  <bmh> BenJackson: hmm?
2011-12-11T17:35:44  <bmh> BenJackson: I always thought this 'competition' was so we could learn about ourselves ;)
2011-12-11T17:36:00  <BenJackson> in that case I could quit :)
2011-12-11T17:36:18  <BenJackson> I was ready to accept top 20 until I was briefly in the top 10
2011-12-11T17:36:22  <BenJackson> then I revised my goal :)
2011-12-11T17:37:09  <bretep> Then you get a bunch of new bots uploaded at the last day and get beaten out of top100 ;)
2011-12-11T17:37:35  <bmh> I am so not excited about implementing combat.
2011-12-11T17:41:23  <Extrarius> I wish I had a nice computer from ST:TNG so I could just dictate to it instead of having to take the time to convert moderate algorithms into huge code bases =-/ I probably wont have a bot done in time simply due to that. I suppose I might as well submit what I have even if it gets stomped on TCP
2011-12-11T17:41:25  <UncleVasya> okay, okay. few hours of being #1 was enough for me...
2011-12-11T17:41:44  <BenJackson> haha
2011-12-11T17:42:15  <BenJackson> wow, v4 has played 2380 games
2011-12-11T17:42:21  <BenJackson> and v5 has played 942
2011-12-11T17:42:54  <bmh> BenJackson: I wish the server had smarter matchmaking...
2011-12-11T17:44:09  <BenJackson> yeah, tcp is 1st-come-1st-serve
2011-12-11T17:44:11  <bmh> I'm going to swap out the maps with the current set. I think that will involve bouncing the server
2011-12-11T17:45:02  <BenJackson> where is the tcp code?
2011-12-11T17:45:09  <BenJackson> maybe it wouldn't be that hard to add matchmaking

2011-12-11T18:14:20  <Antimony> yeah
2011-12-11T18:14:35  <Antimony> but once you've explored a certain amount of the map, you can tell that it's impossible to have any more by symmetry
2011-12-11T18:14:56  <BenJackson> there are lots of ways to infer player count
2011-12-11T18:14:59  <BenJackson> initial map size limits the set

2011-12-11T18:15:28  <ikaros> on the server not on local
2011-12-11T18:15:42  <Antimony> plus symmetry
2011-12-11T18:15:44  <BenJackson> strcat is using C++11 I think
2011-12-11T18:16:06  <BenJackson> Antimony: limiting above would be most useful
2011-12-11T18:16:12  <BenJackson> if you know you're down to 2

2011-12-11T18:39:52  <thestinger> speedtest says my download speed is 30mbit
2011-12-11T18:40:18  <thestinger> in theory the plan is for 12mbit download
2011-12-11T18:40:36  <thestinger> but they throttle some things way down and speed up other things now...
2011-12-11T18:40:54  <thestinger> I think if it uses more than 20MB in one connection, it goes down to 12mbit again
2011-12-11T18:41:09  <thestinger> and P2P is throttled to like 80kbit in theory, but it doesn't really work
2011-12-11T18:41:14  <bmh> It would be a better world if municipalities owned the local lines and providers bid on trunk access.

2011-12-11T18:47:43  <BenJackson> ahaha everyone has figured out the trick I saw and then retroactively noticed the top bots using
2011-12-11T18:48:03  <BenJackson> I guess that was obvious when you took out the timed-out bot
2011-12-11T18:48:18  <bmh> thestinger: your bot needs more aggression
2011-12-11T18:48:39  <a1k0n> which trick?
2011-12-11T18:48:55  <thestinger> BenJackson: huh? :P
2011-12-11T18:49:05  <thestinger> I don't have a special case for bots that time out :(
2011-12-11T18:49:49  <BenJackson> looks like you notice bots that aren't moving though
2011-12-11T18:50:02  <a1k0n> oh, yeah.  i was thinking about adding that
2011-12-11T18:50:17  <antimatroid1> what determining if a bot has timed out?
2011-12-11T18:50:25  <antimatroid1> has anyone tried faking timed out?
2011-12-11T18:50:32  <thestinger> BenJackson: nope
2011-12-11T18:51:00  <bmh> antimatroid1: play dead! a brilliant strategy
2011-12-11T18:51:33  <antimatroid1> bmh: if the person thought you were dead after 1 turn of no moves from visible ants and you were expecting a large battle to come the following turn?
2011-12-11T18:51:37  <antimatroid1> i'm reaching a bit here :P
2011-12-11T18:51:52  <thestinger> BenJackson: the way I do my combat, it always works well when the enemy doesn't move
2011-12-11T18:52:06  <BenJackson> ah
2011-12-11T18:52:08  <bmh> antimatroid1: ok, I'm going to make my bot play dead :)
2011-12-11T18:52:16  <antimatroid1> thestinger and i are combat bros i think
2011-12-11T18:52:31  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I did implement the potential ant function you were discussing
2011-12-11T18:52:34  <BenJackson> it's very interesting
2011-12-11T18:52:38  <thestinger> BenJackson: I'm just trying to work out bugs atm, so I only generate 1 set of moves for the opponent - but I have it set up so I can make any number of them
2011-12-11T18:52:42  <antimatroid1> thestinger: i'm curious what moves you go for in the 4-5 for each set
2011-12-11T18:52:55  <antimatroid1> i have 3-4 to try, but atm it's still only doing 2 per set of ants
2011-12-11T18:53:20  <antimatroid1> potential ant function?
2011-12-11T18:53:31  <antimatroid1> as in possible battle enemies for each location you can move into?
2011-12-11T18:53:39  <thestinger> sort of
2011-12-11T18:53:47  <antimatroid1> that's the basis for my combat move selection
2011-12-11T18:53:50  <thestinger> I basically have a function that returns a score for a tile
2011-12-11T18:53:54  <antimatroid1> minimise that or minimise positive that
2011-12-11T18:53:59  <thestinger> and then sort the places they could move
2011-12-11T18:54:08  <thestinger> and try them in that order
2011-12-11T18:54:33  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I thought you were the one talking about tracking where ants could be in the fog of war
2011-12-11T18:54:42  <antimatroid1> oh yeah that
2011-12-11T18:54:48  <antimatroid1> yeah i like that too
2011-12-11T18:55:11  <bmh> speaking of bad internet connections, I had a "first world problem" earlier today: My Roomba unplugged my modem.
2011-12-11T18:55:20  <antimatroid1> BenJackson: it adds in the problem of when do you go back to not recently seen squares now?
2011-12-11T18:55:35  <bluegaspode> bj_v7: what skill would it have on official servers?
2011-12-11T18:55:57  <a1k0n> bmh: haha
2011-12-11T18:56:09  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: are you tracking where potential enemies might be?
2011-12-11T18:56:16  <a1k0n> our floor is too slippery so our roomba can't dock without moving it every time
2011-12-11T18:56:22  <antimatroid1> for your perimeter around your hills?
2011-12-11T18:56:23  <BenJackson> bluegaspode: you can look at where it *was* when it was up but that's slightly stale
2011-12-11T18:56:35  <a1k0n> antimatroid1: no.  thought about it, haven't.
2011-12-11T18:56:45  <BenJackson> 82.79
2011-12-11T18:57:14  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: do you just maximise vision around your hills?
2011-12-11T18:57:20  <BenJackson> V8 and 9 were buggy and weren't up long enough to stabilize.  V10 is at 86.22 and bouncing around a bit
2011-12-11T18:57:22  <bmh> a1k0n: I think I found a better way to do perimeter
2011-12-11T18:57:31  <antimatroid1> bmh: ?
2011-12-11T18:57:48  <a1k0n> i just try to maximize vision, period, and keep my ants between my hill and enemy ants.  potential enemies would fit into that framework but it's not implemented
2011-12-11T18:58:16  <antimatroid1> i try to get ants onto enemy ants shortest paths to my hills then try and push them away from my hills
2011-12-11T18:58:20  <bmh> enqueue 1) enemy hills, 2) enemy ants -- search from the enemies to your hill. If your search would transition from a visible square to a non-visible square, don't search that edge
2011-12-11T18:58:24  <bluegaspode> aahh - ok - at 82.79 then I'm not too sad that I just lost against it
2011-12-11T18:58:40  <antimatroid1> i managed to encapsulate that into a specifically ordered bfs from enemy ants
2011-12-11T18:58:55  <BenJackson> bluegaspode: there was a request for stiffer competition, but I can take it back down
2011-12-11T18:59:02  <bmh> move ants toward the resulting search gradient
2011-12-11T18:59:25  <antimatroid1> well i bfs out from hills and do it for each enemy ant as i find them
2011-12-11T18:59:47  <antimatroid1> so i sort of deal with the ants closest to hills first, although it'll only move an ant that can at least meet the enemy at the hill
2011-12-11T19:00:20  <thestinger> bmh: my bot does need to be more aggressive - the goal is to trade 1 of my ants for 2 enemies atm, and I haven't figured out a good way to adjust that
2011-12-11T19:00:39  <bmh> it will cause your ants to self-organize and block the routes to your hill
2011-12-11T19:00:43  <Vaenom> did anyone tried Memetix single pass combat algo?
2011-12-11T19:00:55  <bmh> memetix? Is that like lolcats?

2011-12-11T19:02:12  <antimatroid1> are others trying to push enemies away from your hills?
2011-12-11T19:02:17  <antimatroid1> or just collecting enemies around hills?
2011-12-11T19:02:24  <Vaenom> It seems I don't get it because my ants are retarded at combat
2011-12-11T19:02:38  <antimatroid1> Vaenom: you could try what thestinger and i are doing

2011-12-11T19:05:44  <thestinger> antimatroid1: yeah, I'm going to try that
2011-12-11T19:05:47  <antimatroid1> more time in the competition, not turn time
2011-12-11T19:05:56  <antimatroid1> thestinger: max 2 moves per ant?
2011-12-11T19:06:15  <antimatroid1> ie. a location with no possible battle enemies and a location that minimises possible battle enemies?
2011-12-11T19:06:21  <antimatroid1> then try all non-colliding combinations?
2011-12-11T19:06:27  <Vaenom> interesting. so was that what you were talking about in the last few minutes?  cause I'd read the log then
2011-12-11T19:06:35  <thestinger> antimatroid1: probably not all of them
2011-12-11T19:06:36  <antimatroid1> don't think so
2011-12-11T19:06:37  <bluegaspode> BenJackson: no it's ok to have v7, just needed to know where I was up against
2011-12-11T19:06:42  <thestinger> I guess it depends on the size of the battle
2011-12-11T19:07:16  <antimatroid1> i'd try and work out how to iteratively generate them all simultaneously so you can just stop and evaluate what you have when you run out of time
2011-12-11T19:08:01  <thestinger> I might just do something silly like generating 5 sets of moves, with some randomness thrown in so they aren't the same
2011-12-11T19:08:11  <BenJackson> my combat is not perfect but I do like that I've seen it do some really clever things
2011-12-11T19:08:29  <BenJackson> like that time an ant walking through another hallway stepped into a niche where the water was only 1 thick
2011-12-11T19:08:38  <BenJackson> broke the stalemate and helped some other group break through
2011-12-11T19:09:01  <antimatroid1> Vaenom: what i do is basically this, find a battle partition which consists of vector<Location> myAnts, enemyAnts, then for each set I find 2 sets of moves, so like vector<Move> myOffensiveMoves, myDefensiveMoves, enemyOffensiveMoves, enemyDefensiveMoves, then I pick my moves that maximise the worst outcome when i have simulated battle and evaluated
2011-12-11T19:09:03  <thestinger> there are often 1-3 directions that are equally scored, so I shuffle the order I try directions - if I generate a set of moves twice, it won't be the same
2011-12-11T19:09:50  <thestinger> I could just do 4 different sets of moves with different weights on the directions (instead of pseudo-random weights)
2011-12-11T19:09:54  <BenJackson> I rarely have perfectly equal scores for all moves because in combat I salt in a bit of the global strategy weighting

2011-12-11T19:11:56  <antimatroid1> Vaenom: then you can add in more sets of moves for each set of ants, or try combinations of offensive/defensive moves for ants etc. to check more of the tree
2011-12-11T19:12:33  <antimatroid1> like you might take your offensive moves and choose the defensive moves for some of the ants that did in the best worst base and see if you can't improve the best worst case situation

2011-12-11T19:12:42  <Vaenom> antimatroid1 "then I pick my moves that maximise the worst outcome when i have simulated battle and evaluated". you evaluate all the possible combo of those moves?
2011-12-11T19:12:57  <antimatroid1> no, i evaluate 4 times
2011-12-11T19:13:04  <thestinger> I sort of do it a different way now
2011-12-11T19:13:23  <thestinger> I make sets of moves for the enemy, and then try to pick the best way to deal with it (maximizing the worst case, like before)

2011-12-11T19:18:21  <antimatroid1> hmm, i just have an outcome struct with an order operation
2011-12-11T19:19:20  <bmh> currently I just have a pile of goals and my ants chase their nearest goals. Any thoughts on converting my "distance to goal" into a weighting so that I can combined multiple goals?
2011-12-11T19:21:13  <bmh> In the interest of trying the stupidest thing that might plausible work, off the top of my head I was going to assign points to each goal on distance where f(d) = 1/sqrt(d) and then the value of a move is just the sum of scores
2011-12-11T19:21:28  <thestinger> I've slowly converted my pure distance gradient maps to be weighted in some ways
2011-12-11T19:21:52  <thestinger> I started with a BFS for each target basically, then combined some of them into multi-source BFS
2011-12-11T19:21:55  <antimatroid1> bmh: something like that
2011-12-11T19:22:06  <thestinger> and you don't have to start all targets at 0 distance
2011-12-11T19:22:11  <thestinger> or increment by 1
2011-12-11T19:22:26  <antimatroid1> i still just send ants to their nearest target at the end
2011-12-11T19:22:56  <bmh> I aggressively downweight "nearest unseen square" -- my ants will only spread out and forage if they really have nothing better to do
2011-12-11T19:23:15  <antimatroid1> i think it's worth trying to explore the maps straight up

2011-12-11T19:31:48  <bmh> BenJackson: humans are bad at two things: detecting randomness and measuring things.
2011-12-11T19:32:06  <Anilm3> compared to what?
2011-12-11T19:32:17  <Anilm3> a ruler?
2011-12-11T19:32:19  <coachbudka> hi all -- is there a way to get the stacktraces of my bot crashing on EVERY game?
2011-12-11T19:32:44  <Anilm3> coachbudka: valgrind, gdb
2011-12-11T19:32:46  <bmh> Anilm3: compared to the rigorous application of Bayes theorem.
2011-12-11T19:33:02  <Anilm3> you know even a computer can't detect randomness right?
2011-12-11T19:33:19  <Anilm3> except when you have a known pattern of course
2011-12-11T19:33:54  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.26831 this is a really strange map
2011-12-11T19:33:57  <bmh> Anilm3: Are you making some point about kolmogorov complexity?
2011-12-11T19:33:59  <Anilm3> forget it I'm just workahollic
2011-12-11T19:34:03  <thestinger> all the hills are right next to each other, but there's a bunch of open space
2011-12-11T19:34:05  <coachbudka> I'm using .NET, everything works fine when I compile and run locally, I don't know if mono is acting differently
2011-12-11T19:34:32  <BenJackson> thestinger: btw last I lokoed at maps.php there were so many that in the finals you won't even play on every map
2011-12-11T19:34:35  <BenJackson> by a long shot
2011-12-11T19:35:20  <thestinger> I thought there was going to be a minimum distance between hills or something along those lines
2011-12-11T19:35:26  <thestinger> it seems like that would filter out 80% of these maps
2011-12-11T19:35:39  <BenJackson> it's only 20
2011-12-11T19:35:47  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-11T19:35:57  <BenJackson> that map passes
2011-12-11T19:36:37  <thestinger> my defense code was my offense on that map :P
2011-12-11T19:37:00  <BenJackson> oic, you won that because you found the big free area
2011-12-11T19:37:54  <thestinger> well, looking for food always takes priority
2011-12-11T19:38:28  <BenJackson> I don't look for it specially, I only eat it specially
2011-12-11T19:38:35  <thestinger> I just don't send multiple ants to targets in the same direction when doing that, which is what limits it
2011-12-11T19:38:40  <BenJackson> but in that case the one ant that would have kept me in that race just happened to get tied up in combat
2011-12-11T19:38:53  <thestinger> well not really the "same direction" - I have a sneaky way of dealing with it :)

2011-12-11T19:40:59  <BenJackson> coachbudka: janzert said it should jus show up
2011-12-11T19:42:05  <coachbudka> it does tell me what turn it timed out, but that's it
2011-12-11T19:42:45  <thestinger> my bot would do much better if the turntime was 30ms
2011-12-11T19:42:59  <Anilm3> what?
2011-12-11T19:43:02  <Anilm3> 30ms?
2011-12-11T19:43:04  <Anilm3> really?
2011-12-11T19:43:06  <thestinger> I mean relative to other bots :P
2011-12-11T19:43:14  <Anilm3> oh I see
2011-12-11T19:43:15  <Anilm3> :p
2011-12-11T19:43:16  <thestinger> it really never uses more than 50ms atm, ever
2011-12-11T19:43:34  <thestinger> pre-combat takes ~4ms, combat takes 2ms to 40ms usually
2011-12-11T19:43:54  <thestinger> and useless debugging code takes another 15ms
2011-12-11T19:44:08  <Anilm3> quite good then

2011-12-11T19:44:55  <thestinger> well, I just haven't figured out what to do with all the time (I could make my combat use up all the time, and I probably will - but I'm not really sure it will help)
2011-12-11T19:45:17  <thestinger> the stupid moves that sometimes happen just make my bot a bit more aggressive
2011-12-11T19:45:37  <thestinger> cautious bots don't take advantage of the little mistakes
2011-12-11T19:45:43  <thestinger> and it makes them lose ground
2011-12-11T19:46:09  <Anilm3> thestinger: try implementing symmetry detection
2011-12-11T19:46:50  <thestinger> I don't think it would help
2011-12-11T19:47:11  <Anilm3> it could give you an upper hand
2011-12-11T19:47:12  <thestinger> I tried testing locally with enemy hill locations hardcoded at the start - it just makes my bot rush too early
2011-12-11T19:47:22  <BenJackson> yup
2011-12-11T19:47:22  <Anilm3> oh
2011-12-11T19:47:25  <Anilm3> nice to know
2011-12-11T19:47:29  <BenJackson> btw I use a similar trick to test *against* my bot
2011-12-11T19:47:32  <thestinger> as soon as I find a hill, my bot goes into offense mode instead of explore basically
2011-12-11T19:47:36  <BenJackson> when I tried to harden V10 against dumb bot rushes
2011-12-11T19:47:44  <thestinger> it still searches for food at the same rate, but it doesn't just "explore"
2011-12-11T19:47:45  <BenJackson> big multiplayer maps where everyone else knows where bot 0 is
2011-12-11T19:48:56  <thestinger> the initial build-up is really important, because it's one of the things my bot is good at
2011-12-11T19:49:11  <thestinger> and if it knows about enemy hills early, it doesn't take advantage of that strength
2011-12-11T19:49:34  <thestinger> it does really badly in games that drag on if the enemy bot(s) actually hunt ants or control territory
2011-12-11T19:50:43  <antimatroid1> lol, just fixed a retarded bug in my bot
2011-12-11T19:51:14  <antimatroid1> i was basically zorg rushing every non-battle ant towards enemy hills aha

2011-12-11T20:50:47  <dmj111> but I agree with the others I saw here... it didn't help when I tried it, and made the bot too aggressive.  Watching the bot march on unseen hills was fun, while it lasted.

2011-12-11T21:05:03  <thestinger> that version still did combat globally - for the whole map
2011-12-11T21:05:11  <thestinger> so each simulation does _every_ ant
2011-12-11T21:06:05  <thestinger> if only pguillory didn't time out - he could have killed off most of my ants and I wouldn't have timed out

2011-12-11T21:23:24  <Vaenom> when checking if a point is "in range" of ant attack, should I consider "in range" inclusively or exclusively of the AttackRadius2 ?

2011-12-11T21:25:29  <Vaenom> in other words:  (dX * dX + dY * dY <= AttackRadius2)   or  (dX * dX + dY * dY < AttackRadius2)?

2011-12-11T22:12:27  <dmj111> i hacked some stuff out for combat resolution, but if you watch my bot, you will see I didn't do it right.
2011-12-11T22:12:27  <McLeopold> putting them into globes, then running simulations for each glob separately
2011-12-11T22:12:30  <bmh> Anilm3: one group of ants fights Nazis while the other fights Fascists.
2011-12-11T22:12:44  <Anilm3> bmh: sounds familiar
2011-12-11T22:12:54  <McLeopold> I'm trying out some suicide code on tcp right now
2011-12-11T22:13:00  <dmj111> BenJackson: yeah, not too expensive to do.  I am happy with my current code cause it is simpler than what I started with.
2011-12-11T22:13:23  <bmh> http://bhickey.net:2080/replay.7115  -- revert time
2011-12-11T22:13:34  <McLeopold> BenJackson: maybe you could describe your sym dection method then?
2011-12-11T22:13:38  <dmj111> McLeopold: for theaters... I did consider it, esp. for trying to reduce the number of possibilities in any battle.
2011-12-11T22:13:58  <Anilm3> even though symmetry detection might not worth it, I still think it's a very interesting concept
2011-12-11T22:14:01  <McLeopold> dmj111: okay, how about scheduling single ants to pick up multiple food?
2011-12-11T22:14:09  <Anilm3> I was very impressed with dmj111 video
2011-12-11T22:14:16  <BenJackson> McLeopold: I will after the contest ends
2011-12-11T22:14:37  <dmj111> McLeopold: man, my bot is dumb.   that sounds like a good idea, but I didn't do any of it.
2011-12-11T22:15:00  <McLeopold> ooh, I beat skynet
2011-12-11T22:15:20  <Anilm3> a fake skynet surely
2011-12-11T22:15:24  <McLeopold> v2
2011-12-11T22:15:43  <McLeopold> I think I was timing out on all the other matches
2011-12-11T22:15:47  <Anilm3> the entire human race couldn't defeat it, I don't think ants can
2011-12-11T22:17:09  <Anilm3> any one likes game of thrones (series)

2011-12-11T23:29:23  <dmj111> BenJackson: roger that
2011-12-11T23:33:47  <McLeopold> dmj111: so, for creating sets of symmetries, you assume any number of players is possible?
2011-12-11T23:35:31  <dmj111> I restrict it to <= 10, mainly for speed.  otherwise, I create a bunch of invalid symmetries.  actually... those are really only a problem for creating the water/land map.  otherwise, the speed is fine, I think.
2011-12-11T23:35:32  <McLeopold> so, for 2 players, you can divide the map in half, length or width, then assume translational, or for mirrored or rotated, make a group for every row/col the map could be foled at?
2011-12-11T23:35:51  <McLeopold> folded
2011-12-11T23:36:20  <BenJackson> yeah, I'd think speed of your algo would be fine in terms of ruling symmetries in/out
2011-12-11T23:36:25  <BenJackson> but making that movie would have been expensive
2011-12-11T23:36:25  <dmj111> yeah, I think I don't care how many players there are.  I'll try anything.
2011-12-11T23:36:49  <dmj111> BenJackson: yep.  the first 10 turns are wicked slow....
2011-12-11T23:37:44  <dmj111> McLeopold: not sure if I answered your question yet.  you _could_ eliminate symmetries based on the number of players if you wanted.   I didn't.
2011-12-11T23:38:20  <McLeopold> I'm more wondering how many symmetries there are on average, to start
2011-12-11T23:38:41  <McLeopold> for arguments sake, let's say a 10x10 map, and you start at 0,0
2011-12-11T23:38:44  <dmj111> I should test it against all the official maps, and see if it really works.
2011-12-11T23:38:50  <dmj111> :)
2011-12-11T23:38:59  <McLeopold> and 2 players
2011-12-11T23:39:28  <McLeopold> for translation, there are 2 possible ways, I think
2011-12-11T23:40:35  <dmj111> 3?  (0,5), (5,5), (5,0) ?
2011-12-11T23:40:36  <McLeopold> for a mirrored map, there are 5 folded horz, and 5 folded vert, would that be correct?
2011-12-11T23:40:45  <dmj111> yes, I think
2011-12-11T23:40:56  <McLeopold> oh, right, 3 for translation
2011-12-11T23:41:05  <McLeopold> split vert or horz
2011-12-11T23:41:10  <dmj111> ah, yes, some of the symmetries the code generates are really exactly the same.
2011-12-11T23:41:26  <dmj111> so it would generate each of the mirrored versions twice.
