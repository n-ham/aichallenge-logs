2011-03-26T00:00:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: others agreed, i don't mind
2011-03-26T00:00:40  <janzert> McLeopold: if we're going to go that route it would probably be better for a map to declare its "type" then the engine can decide if a particular food spawning methods fits with that map type
2011-03-26T00:00:40  <antimatroid> i think we should just add a parameter to maps indicating what type it is
2011-03-26T00:00:42  <McLeopold> they are very much separate concerns, although some combos do fit together nicely
2011-03-26T00:01:11  <amstan> McLeopold: food generation seems to be closely related to map gen, because of symmetry types, so every different type of symmetry has another kind of food spawn system
2011-03-26T00:01:33  <janzert> total random works with them all :)
2011-03-26T00:01:48  <amstan> janzert: but total random is not fair
2011-03-26T00:02:03  <amstan> especially if we decide we have to move toward symmetric everything
2011-03-26T00:02:25  <sigh> I think map should pass its type
2011-03-26T00:02:28  <janzert> but is it unfair in a way that actually ends up mattering in the long run? I know a lot of people here think so, I don't think it's really been determined
2011-03-26T00:02:52  <janzert> at the same time I don't think the other methods are necessarily worse
2011-03-26T00:03:00  <janzert> so I'm fine with them too
2011-03-26T00:03:05  <sigh> janzert: I think later in the game it is not such an issue, but at the start it is
2011-03-26T00:03:05  <amstan> janzert: depends on what people think
2011-03-26T00:03:20  <amstan> sigh: start is pretty important
2011-03-26T00:03:34  <sigh> amstan: wasn't saying otherwise
2011-03-26T00:04:17  <janzert> and the latest method I've heard for spawning food should work on any map
2011-03-26T00:04:27  <janzert> any symmetry or asymmetry
2011-03-26T00:04:31  <sigh> the one antimatroid proposed?
2011-03-26T00:04:39  <sigh> for asymettric?
2011-03-26T00:04:39  <janzert> yes, I believe so
2011-03-26T00:04:54  <amstan> janzert: which one? antimatroid: ping
2011-03-26T00:05:02  * sigh hates spelling symmetry or any variant thereof
2011-03-26T00:05:15  <amstan> sigh: self-similar?
2011-03-26T00:05:52  <sigh> variant was the wrong word, hate spelling words that use symmetry as the stem :P
2011-03-26T00:06:13  <antimatroid> amstan: the one i came up with when you were here earlier
2011-03-26T00:06:17  <janzert> amstan: take all the squares a player can reach first and check how long it takes to reach them from the starting position, then randomly pick a "same distance" square for each player to spawn food in
2011-03-26T00:07:14  <sigh> janzert: how is the distribution chosen?
2011-03-26T00:07:32  <antimatroid> i would do just random
2011-03-26T00:07:35  <janzert> uniform I presume
2011-03-26T00:07:40  <antimatroid> it's still not "symmetric" after the first turn
2011-03-26T00:07:44  <sigh> uniform over what is the question :P
2011-03-26T00:08:01  <sigh> eg. uniform over distances is not uniform over squares
2011-03-26T00:08:04  <janzert> over distances and set of squares within the distance would be good enough
2011-03-26T00:08:10  <janzert> I believe
2011-03-26T00:08:22  <sigh> that gives preference to squares close to home
2011-03-26T00:08:23  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't think that matters too much
2011-03-26T00:08:43  <janzert> I think that's a nice side benefit ;)
2011-03-26T00:08:47  <sigh> ok :)
2011-03-26T00:08:49  <janzert> gives a "base"
2011-03-26T00:08:57  <janzert> but shh don't tell jeff
2011-03-26T00:09:03  <janzert> :P
2011-03-26T00:09:15  <janzert> there is one other corner problem
2011-03-26T00:09:33  <janzert> that I haven't seen mentioned so far
2011-03-26T00:10:01  <antimatroid> ...
2011-03-26T00:10:09  <janzert> in an asymmetric map one player is likely to have squares it can reach first but are farther than any other player has
2011-03-26T00:10:28  <janzert> in a naive implementation presumably these squares will never spawn food
2011-03-26T00:11:00  <antimatroid> we could get the map analyzer to try and minimise that, but yeah, good point
2011-03-26T00:11:00  <janzert> there are ways it could be worked around but none very pretty that I've thought of so far
2011-03-26T00:11:04  <sigh> there are multiple other things that can cause unfairness, but yes
2011-03-26T00:11:31  <sigh> related to the same sort of issues
2011-03-26T00:11:51  <sigh> just because the squares are the same distance, doesn't mean they are just as easy to control
2011-03-26T00:11:52  <antimatroid> sigh: i don't know what you're going to do about squares that players can reach equally
2011-03-26T00:11:57  <antimatroid> i'll let you worry about that :P
2011-03-26T00:12:07  <sigh> :(
2011-03-26T00:12:32  <janzert> sigh: probably but it seems I'm less concerned about "fairness" by trying to exactly equalize all game conditions than anyone else
2011-03-26T00:12:37  <sigh> imo, trying too hard to make asymmetric maps completely fair
2011-03-26T00:12:45  <sigh> and we should just go with the sections method
2011-03-26T00:12:52  <janzert> so long as the unequal conditions aren't systematically biased toward any player
2011-03-26T00:12:55  <sigh> trying too hard to make asymmetric maps completely fair is impossible
2011-03-26T00:13:14  <antimatroid> erm?
2011-03-26T00:13:39  <antimatroid> that sentence kind of implies there is nothing you could do that is too much in order to make asymmetric maps fair
2011-03-26T00:14:06  <sigh> I think we are getting too complicated for little benefit
2011-03-26T00:14:29  <sigh> and sweeping the edge cases under the rug for who ever implements it to clean up :P
2011-03-26T00:16:14  <sigh> McLeopold: when you have the time it would be great if you had a look at parse_orders, because it has changed what is being communicated to the engine: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py#L313
2011-03-26T00:53:43  <sigh> antimatroid: I think I found a case where the vision algorithm depends on the order of the initial ants
2011-03-26T00:53:52  <McLeopold> sigh: personally, I'm against using exceptions unless you are building a library for distribution.
2011-03-26T00:54:43  <antimatroid> sigh: ?
2011-03-26T00:54:47  <sigh> McLeopold: in this case the exceptions made the code a lot shorter, and let me specify the format of the invalid line in one place
2011-03-26T00:54:56  <sigh> but I'm more concerned about the functionality
2011-03-26T00:57:06  <sigh> antimatroid: just investigating the cause of my non-determinism in the engine... it seems that get_vision returns a slightly different result depending on what order you add ants to the initial queue... currently investigating
2011-03-26T00:57:48  <antimatroid> where is get_vision?
2011-03-26T00:58:06  <sigh> in ants.py
2011-03-26T00:58:09  <antimatroid> it will be if you give a square to an ant the first time it's seen, and don't check the distance to a marked square you hit
2011-03-26T00:58:36  <antimatroid> so say you have a...b, you will hit the middle square with one of them first, you need to count the second because it's at the same distance
2011-03-26T00:59:24  <sigh> the vision algorithm only looks at the ants of one player at a time
2011-03-26T00:59:34  <sigh> did you mean a...a?
2011-03-26T01:00:08  <antimatroid> ah, then it shouldn't matter :\
2011-03-26T01:01:00  <McLeopold> sigh: you're using the exceptions as a structured way to shortcut the parsing and return a value
2011-03-26T01:01:37  <McLeopold> It works, and would be fine, but I think there are better more semantic ways to accomplish that.  It's just a matter of style.
2011-03-26T01:02:12  <sigh> what do you think is better?
2011-03-26T01:02:24  <McLeopold> perhaps a function that takes a single line and returns an error
2011-03-26T01:02:27  <antimatroid> sigh: can you pastebin the example that comes out differently?
2011-03-26T01:02:32  <McLeopold> you can have function in functions
2011-03-26T01:02:47  <sigh> antimatroid: working on a reproducible case
2011-03-26T01:02:55  <McLeopold> technically, these are not exceptions in the sense that you don't know what to do
2011-03-26T01:03:15  <sigh> McLeopold: ok I'll do that... I don't mind either way, just didn't want to repeat code
2011-03-26T01:03:17  <McLeopold> nor should you worry about which level is going to catch them
2011-03-26T01:03:53  <McLeopold> yeah, the code looks nice :), just use a more semantic structure
2011-03-26T01:03:59  <sigh> McLeopold: but more importantly, do you agree with moving all the validation into parse_orders?
2011-03-26T01:05:31  <McLeopold> oh....um....
2011-03-26T01:05:49  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-26T01:06:02  <McLeopold> parse should parse into tokens and numbers
2011-03-26T01:06:09  <McLeopold> something else should check game logic
2011-03-26T01:06:32  <McLeopold> I want to hook test bots in at different levels so I don't have to deal with strings
2011-03-26T01:07:55  <sigh> ok, then move it up a level... should do_moves care about validation
2011-03-26T01:08:17  <sigh> because currently that function is the only way to communicate to the engine about invalid orders
2011-03-26T01:08:48  <McLeopold> the engine should only get strings that it logs or prints, nothing that it could intepret
2011-03-26T01:09:09  <McLeopold> the engine will check is_alive if it needs to know if a player is kicked
2011-03-26T01:09:22  <sigh> what is the point of invalid_orders return value then?
2011-03-26T01:09:28  <McLeopold> so the game class makes the decision to kick a player, not the engine
2011-03-26T01:09:35  <McLeopold> for logging
2011-03-26T01:10:55  <McLeopold> bedtime, night
2011-03-26T01:11:01  <sigh> ok, night

2011-03-26T01:22:00  <antimatroid> can you paste bin?
2011-03-26T01:22:04  <antimatroid> i've got a friend here watching movies
2011-03-26T01:22:04  <sigh> get a different result for ants at: [(15, 12), (16, 11), (22, 22), (21, 23), (23, 23), (14, 12), (20, 19), (18, 13), (21, 18), (22, 20)]
2011-03-26T01:22:15  <antimatroid> or is it just a number?
2011-03-26T01:22:32  <antimatroid> you should try getting it to fill in your squares and output the result
2011-03-26T01:22:45  <sigh> it's slightly different viewable area
2011-03-26T01:22:53  <sigh> printing it out is not very enlightening :P
2011-03-26T01:25:11  <sigh> I will pastebin it the two outputs
2011-03-26T01:28:06  <sigh> http://pastebin.com/VRm3qcMv and http://pastebin.com/mrrXSEJ0
2011-03-26T01:28:37  <sigh> ^^ antimatroid
2011-03-26T01:29:09  <sigh> a dot from line 24 moves to line 27
2011-03-26T01:29:12  <sigh> :D
2011-03-26T01:29:12  <antimatroid> so there's two that swap bottom left
2011-03-26T01:29:17  <sigh> yes
2011-03-26T01:29:50  <sigh> the only difference between the ant lists is the order
2011-03-26T01:31:00  <antimatroid> yeah, i think the algorithm must be wrong
2011-03-26T01:31:23  <antimatroid> actually, i can break it
2011-03-26T01:31:27  <antimatroid> i'll paste bin you a broken example
2011-03-26T01:31:28  <sigh> the implementation is wrong?
2011-03-26T01:31:33  <antimatroid> no, the algorithm
2011-03-26T01:31:36  <sigh> ah :(
2011-03-26T01:31:41  <antimatroid> yeah i know :P
2011-03-26T01:31:46  <sigh> yeah, I was afraid of that
2011-03-26T01:32:26  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/P0TWwFcU
2011-03-26T01:32:41  <antimatroid> it's going to go through that water from one of the positions
2011-03-26T01:32:55  <antimatroid> one is going to need to store multiple locations to check if there is a collision
2011-03-26T01:32:58  <sigh> the algorithm doesn't care about water
2011-03-26T01:33:05  <antimatroid> hmmm, good point
2011-03-26T01:33:07  <sigh> this is just vision
2011-03-26T01:33:19  <antimatroid> can that type of situation happen without water?
2011-03-26T01:33:35  <sigh> given that water is not looked at at all, yes
2011-03-26T01:33:36  <antimatroid> i don't think it can
2011-03-26T01:33:48  <sigh> I will do some more testing, and make some more robust tests
2011-03-26T01:33:56  <antimatroid> i'll keep thinking
2011-03-26T01:34:05  <sigh> hopefully get a smaller test case :)
2011-03-26T01:35:41  <sigh> antimatroid: this is what was causing the engine to be non-deterministic, btw :(
2011-03-26T01:36:46  <antimatroid>  sigh: at least we know what's causing it
2011-03-26T01:37:09  <sigh> yeah... well this was an important bug to catch
2011-03-26T01:43:52  <antimatroid> i think i found the problem
2011-03-26T01:44:12  <antimatroid> consider
2011-03-26T01:44:12  <antimatroid> a.
2011-03-26T01:44:12  <antimatroid> .b
2011-03-26T01:44:24  <sigh> aha... just output a case: bad_vision [(25, 46), (26, 45)]
2011-03-26T01:44:42  <sigh> ran a check of vision output against brute force just now
2011-03-26T01:44:57  <sigh> so yeah
2011-03-26T01:45:08  <antimatroid> if you're checking the distance to a square in the same row as a on the right, then dependent on who goes to that square first it'll be different
2011-03-26T01:45:16  <sigh> gtg, will be back in an hour or so
2011-03-26T01:45:23  <antimatroid> okay sure
2011-03-26T01:45:58  <antimatroid> sigh: update the ant to the one with the closest distance each turn
2011-03-26T01:46:05  <antimatroid> that should fix it i think
2011-03-26T01:46:25  * janzert will stop working on his diagram to show the problem now :)
2011-03-26T01:46:32  <antimatroid> :)
2011-03-26T01:46:35  <janzert> since everyone else has also figured it ouy
2011-03-26T01:46:37  <janzert> out
2011-03-26T01:46:39  <sigh> :)
2011-03-26T01:46:47  <sigh> janzert: you knew and didn't tell us? :P
2011-03-26T01:47:05  <antimatroid> janzert is all knowing
2011-03-26T01:47:06  <janzert> well, I wasn't sure I could explain it in words so was making a diagram to illustrate
2011-03-26T01:47:16  <janzert> :}
2011-03-26T01:47:53  <antimatroid> ergh, my fix isn't helpful
2011-03-26T01:47:54  <sigh> if either of you can fix it while I'm out that would be great :)
2011-03-26T01:47:59  <sigh> cya
2011-03-26T01:48:02  <antimatroid> cya
2011-03-26T01:48:08  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@145.115-50-210.dynamic.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-03-26T01:48:18  <janzert> btw, once your algorithm is truly order independent you should be able to get rid of the deque
2011-03-26T01:48:22  <antimatroid> janzert: any idea of how to fix that without scanning out from every ant separately
2011-03-26T01:49:00  <antimatroid> you can for this, but people would need it for say voronoi diagrams
2011-03-26T01:49:29  <janzert> well, you could always add the square to be checked even if it's already marked as visible
2011-03-26T01:49:39  <antimatroid> it might be a matter of adding all joint ants to the list to check
2011-03-26T01:49:45  <janzert> but that will mean it incurs the same work as scanning out from each ant
2011-03-26T01:49:53  <antimatroid> nah, you can do better
2011-03-26T01:50:13  <janzert> sure it's just the simple fix
2011-03-26T01:50:14  <antimatroid> you just have a list of ant locations, and add ants that draw to get to that square first
2011-03-26T01:51:15  <janzert> the question is how do you tell if it is a draw without testing against every ant
2011-03-26T01:51:27  <janzert> since if you do that you're back to the same workload again
2011-03-26T01:51:36  <janzert> or more
2011-03-26T01:51:49  <antimatroid> you make visibility an int map rather than bool
2011-03-26T01:51:54  <antimatroid> and store the distance you hit it at
2011-03-26T01:52:19  <antimatroid> if you do that with voronois, you can use those numbers to back track shortest paths
2011-03-26T01:53:57  <janzert> sure, and if you hit a visible square that is a tie for distance retroactively add the current ant to the list of ants for that square
2011-03-26T01:54:11  <antimatroid> we could always change the distance metric :P
2011-03-26T01:54:23  <janzert> so store the ants to check as in the vision map instead of the square queue
2011-03-26T01:54:29  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-26T01:54:39  <antimatroid> then just need a stack of locations to check from
2011-03-26T01:54:45  <antimatroid> no, needs to be queue
2011-03-26T01:55:16  <antimatroid> because we need to wait to add all draw ants before moving on from that square
2011-03-26T01:55:17  <janzert> I think it can get away with a stack
2011-03-26T01:55:22  <antimatroid> nah
2011-03-26T01:55:25  <janzert> nah
2011-03-26T01:55:33  <janzert> we'll just double check some squares
2011-03-26T01:55:45  <antimatroid> or you could just wait with a queue :P
2011-03-26T01:57:07  <janzert> I'm worried the queue could still have cases it breaks with, although I can't see that it would
2011-03-26T01:57:45  <janzert> I guess it shouldn't
2011-03-26T01:58:39  <janzert> yeah, I think that should work
2011-03-26T01:58:42  <antimatroid> i think we're good after that, similarly when blocking with water
2011-03-26T01:58:57  <janzert> water blocks vision?
2011-03-26T01:59:07  <antimatroid> no never
2011-03-26T01:59:21  <antimatroid> but people will need something like this for their bots
2011-03-26T01:59:26  <antimatroid> and they will want to be blocked by water
2011-03-26T02:00:09  <janzert> for a reachable in x moves map I suppose?
2011-03-26T02:01:12  <antimatroid> i don't think that matters then
2011-03-26T02:01:39  <antimatroid> because your metric is manhatten based in a way
2011-03-26T02:01:44  <janzert> ok, for closest ant to square
2011-03-26T02:01:51  <janzert> eh, even then
2011-03-26T02:02:05  <janzert> ok, when does it matter? :P
2011-03-26T02:02:21  <antimatroid> i'm going to fix it..
2011-03-26T02:02:23  <antimatroid> unless you already are?
2011-03-26T02:02:29  <janzert> no, go ahead
2011-03-26T02:03:15  <antimatroid> it only matters when you're using euclidean metric
2011-03-26T02:03:26  <antimatroid> people will need to worry about if for their own vision funtions
2011-03-26T02:03:39  <janzert> yes, I mean when in the game do you care about euclidean and water blocking it?
2011-03-26T02:11:09  <janzert> btw, the distances in the map should be the true euclidean distance not the manhatten integer distance, I think either actually gives a correct outcome but the euclidean will weed out extra ants much quicker
2011-03-26T02:12:35  <janzert> only mentioning it because you initially were going to change the distances to an int map which won't work with euclidean distances well ;)

2011-03-26T02:13:42  <antimatroid> well yeah, i can use doubles
2011-03-26T02:13:53  <antimatroid> one could just use the metric squares and have integers, but meh
2011-03-26T02:13:56  <antimatroid> it's less clear
2011-03-26T02:14:11  <janzert> yep, just use exactly whatever the distance function hands to you :)

2011-03-26T02:30:36  <antimatroid> janzert: how do i append a list to another list?
2011-03-26T02:30:50  <antimatroid> l1 += l2?
2011-03-26T02:35:12  <janzert> yes
2011-03-26T02:35:36  <janzert> although you probably figured that out by now :)
2011-03-26T02:36:10  <antimatroid> i was waiting anyway, i have a pastebin for you
2011-03-26T02:36:26  <janzert> running an interactive python interpreter is really handy for checking things like that btw
2011-03-26T02:36:53  <janzert> I do it semi frequently when writing python code
2011-03-26T02:37:32  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/wc8C4FHx
2011-03-26T02:38:02  <antimatroid> a game runs
2011-03-26T02:38:09  <antimatroid> the ant count at the end is now different :\
2011-03-26T02:38:22  <janzert> I imagine
2011-03-26T02:39:04  <antimatroid> why?
2011-03-26T02:39:11  <antimatroid> it's like a hardly broken change to vision
2011-03-26T02:39:29  <antimatroid> turns out it varied before :
2011-03-26T02:39:29  <janzert> but I think not a too uncommon one
2011-03-26T02:39:34  <antimatroid> that would be food spawning
2011-03-26T02:39:57  <janzert> ahh, so not a deterministic run
2011-03-26T02:40:50  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure that's right, i'm going to push, sigh can yell at me later if it's not
2011-03-26T02:41:13  <janzert> the inner loop doesn't ever weed out ants
2011-03-26T02:41:46  <janzert> not sure if it actually makes a noticeable difference though
2011-03-26T02:42:19  <antimatroid> weed out ants?
2011-03-26T02:42:25  <antimatroid> oh, i thought about that
2011-03-26T02:42:31  <antimatroid> but then it's very edge cases that it will miss
2011-03-26T02:42:44  <antimatroid> this way you break the loop earlier, although i'm not adding them all, that's a point
2011-03-26T02:42:48  <antimatroid> i might just weed them all
2011-03-26T02:43:11  <antimatroid> oh i was adding them all, that was my += question :P
2011-03-26T02:43:28  <antimatroid> i think it'd be faster to add them all and keep moving, cause usually you will match on the first ant location?
2011-03-26T02:44:31  <janzert> the thing is with the case where the problem was found a..|.b.
2011-03-26T02:44:55  <janzert> the distance is only tied at the first square, the next square out breaks the tie and would eliminate the correct ant
2011-03-26T02:45:09  <janzert> so you never have to test against that ant again if you weed it out

2011-03-26T02:45:43  <antimatroid> janzert: but does that always work?
2011-03-26T02:46:09  <antimatroid> this will work for the moment
2011-03-26T02:46:31  <janzert> but yeah I guess it doesn't matter cause even if it's first in the list it will only test negative on one square where the other tests positive

2011-03-26T02:47:28  <janzert> you're now returning a different data structure than before
2011-03-26T02:47:43  <sigh> heh
2011-03-26T02:47:49  <antimatroid> crap i am
2011-03-26T02:47:52  <janzert> you need to collapse the vision map back down
2011-03-26T02:47:56  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-26T02:48:04  <antimatroid> sigh: you could probably do that neater than i?
2011-03-26T02:48:11  <antimatroid> it shouldn't be more than a line or two
2011-03-26T02:48:16  <sigh> where is code?
2011-03-26T02:48:24  <antimatroid> get_vision in ants.py
2011-03-26T02:48:38  <janzert> vision = [[v for v, a in col] for row in vision]
2011-03-26T02:48:41  <antimatroid> vision is now a matrix of [bool,list] instead of [b]
2011-03-26T02:48:52  <antimatroid> dw, i've got it :)

2011-03-26T02:49:46  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-26T02:49:51  <antimatroid> you wanted col == row yeah?
2011-03-26T02:50:04  <janzert> yes, I think so
2011-03-26T02:50:12  <janzert> although now I want to test it before say so :)
2011-03-26T02:50:49  <sigh> antimatroid: what is the meaning of the [bool, list] ?
2011-03-26T02:51:10  <antimatroid> bool is the square has been painted outwards from already, list is the ants that need to paint outwards
2011-03-26T02:51:55  <sigh> hmmm... so you are treating each ant independently, then?
2011-03-26T02:52:23  <sigh> they don't get in each other's ways, so to speak?
2011-03-26T02:52:24  <janzert> yes, vision = [[v for v, a in row] for row in vision] should do what you need
2011-03-26T02:52:46  <sigh> in this case, there is no point doing a bfs
2011-03-26T02:52:58  <sigh> should just use the same thing that nearby ants does

2011-03-26T02:54:37  <janzert> umm, hate to say this
2011-03-26T02:55:03  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-26T02:55:08  <janzert> antimatroid did you check the output of this?
2011-03-26T02:55:09  <antimatroid> i broke it again?
2011-03-26T02:55:22  <antimatroid> i checked that a game ran
2011-03-26T02:56:01  <janzert> nevermind I thought the test "if not vision[n_row][n_col]:" could never be satisfied but I was reading it wrong
2011-03-26T02:56:01  <antimatroid> i was hoping sigh would now check, he seemed to have it set up to, i have no idea how to easily :P
2011-03-26T02:56:08  <antimatroid> phew :P
2011-03-26T02:56:24  <sigh> yeah, hang on
2011-03-26T02:56:24  <antimatroid> sigh: please check anyway, i did say before i was gambling that you could shout at me later if it's wrong :)
2011-03-26T02:56:39  <janzert> I do worry that it may not be correct though
2011-03-26T02:56:48  <antimatroid> why?
2011-03-26T02:56:49  <janzert> just not completely broken ;)
2011-03-26T02:56:50  <sigh> antimatroid: next time if you are trying experimental stuff do it in a new branch
2011-03-26T02:57:04  <antimatroid> sigh: okay sure, i was expecting you back though
2011-03-26T02:57:32  <sigh> yeah, sure... but the main branch is not the place for untested code :P
2011-03-26T02:58:00  <antimatroid> yeah :P
2011-03-26T02:59:41  <janzert> I hadn't satisfied myself that vision[c_row][c_col] = True won't ever happen before a "drawing" ant makes it there, but at least with 3am thinking I do now think it is fine.
2011-03-26T02:59:59  <janzert> of course the 2:50am thinking is what got me worried about it :P
2011-03-26T03:00:47  * janzert should really stop trying to inspect code for logic errors after 1am
2011-03-26T03:00:50  <sigh> hmm... it's throwing up differences with my naive vision calculation
2011-03-26T03:01:14  <sigh> lemme check
2011-03-26T03:01:23  <antimatroid> erm crap, anyway, back in like 10
2011-03-26T03:03:22  <janzert> sigh: does it work if you take out the "if not vision[n_row][n_col]:" check? ;)
2011-03-26T03:04:13  <sigh> well, now it throws errors
2011-03-26T03:04:24  <sigh> foo.append += bar will tend to do that though
2011-03-26T03:04:33  <janzert> heh
2011-03-26T03:04:36  <janzert> hmm
2011-03-26T03:06:40  <janzert> ok, yeah I'm back to thinking that a vision square can and will be set to true before all the drawing ants get there
2011-03-26T03:06:55  <sigh> ok, here's what I'm going to do... I'm going to replace get_vision with a brute force version until we get an implementation that works
2011-03-26T03:07:07  <janzert> :)
2011-03-26T03:07:09  <sigh> I don't want to keep the repo in a broken state
2011-03-26T03:08:30  <janzert> for various definitions of broken
2011-03-26T03:08:41  <janzert> well at least it will be less broken
2011-03-26T03:15:04  <sigh> hmm... brute force is way too slow for me to want to check in... it takes a 10 sec game to 2 minutes
2011-03-26T03:15:50  <sigh> I'd rather have the slightly broken old version
2011-03-26T03:16:06  <janzert> did you have a script to brute force check for differences against the naive implementation?
2011-03-26T03:16:47  <sigh> janzert: not yet, atm I'm just comparing them inside the game
2011-03-26T03:16:53  <janzert> ok
2011-03-26T03:17:40  <sigh> janzert: I'm think of creating a branch for the current version of the repo, then reverting antimatroid's changes in the main repo to back to how it was
2011-03-26T03:17:47  <sigh> does that sound reasonable
2011-03-26T03:18:03  <sigh> as it is, the code in aichallenge/epsilon will not run
2011-03-26T03:18:28  <sigh> ok it will, but it claims each ant can only see itself
2011-03-26T03:18:56  <janzert> if you want, I think just dropping the extra check and removing .append may be all that's needed
2011-03-26T03:19:13  <sigh> no, there were more errors
2011-03-26T03:19:57  <janzert> if I knew how to test it, I might give fixing it a go :)
2011-03-26T03:20:28  <janzert> but reverting it is fine with me
2011-03-26T03:20:35  <antimatroid> i'm back
2011-03-26T03:20:46  <janzert> or see if antimatroid shows back up soon....
2011-03-26T03:20:51  <antimatroid> ^^
2011-03-26T03:20:57  <janzert> :)
2011-03-26T03:21:08  <antimatroid> i don't mind if you revert it, but we could spend 5 minutes trying to work out why it's broken
2011-03-26T03:21:40  <antimatroid> would it have a problem with renaming vision?
2011-03-26T03:22:22  <sigh> I'm trying to figure out why it is broken
2011-03-26T03:22:43  <sigh> now it is stuck in an infinite loop and my computer is slow

2011-03-26T03:22:59  <antimatroid> get rid of .append
2011-03-26T03:23:12  <antimatroid> that is a rather silly mistake :\
2011-03-26T03:23:43  <antimatroid> sigh ^*
2011-03-26T03:23:56  <sigh> that's what I did, but now I have an infinite loop
2011-03-26T03:24:38  <sigh> which is being kind enough to eat up all my ram and my laptop swap like crazy
2011-03-26T03:25:17  <antimatroid> is that for running a game or your other stuff?
2011-03-26T03:25:37  <antimatroid> it just ran a game for me
2011-03-26T03:27:12  <janzert> antimatroid: as an aside here's how I would have probably done it without the deque
2011-03-26T03:27:16  <sigh> I bet you just played a game where each any can only see itself
2011-03-26T03:27:41  <janzert> completely untested of course
2011-03-26T03:28:26  <sigh> ok, I'm sorry... but how does this thing know when to stop?
2011-03-26T03:29:02  <janzert> heh, yes I just realized that is why the 'if not vision..." check has to be there
2011-03-26T03:30:06  <antimatroid> sigh: when there's no squares left to check
2011-03-26T03:30:27  <sigh> antimatroid: there's always squares to check
2011-03-26T03:30:34  <antimatroid> no there's not

2011-03-26T03:35:34  <antimatroid> return you vision squares
2011-03-26T03:35:58  <antimatroid> and it should terminate, because it only adds non-checked visible squares to the deque

2011-03-26T03:36:53  <janzert> doesn't the "if not vision[n_row][n_col]:" do that?
2011-03-26T03:36:58  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-26T03:37:08  <sigh> that will always evaluate to True

2011-03-26T04:12:15  <janzert> and if it is the len() call is going to be quite a bit slower

2011-03-26T04:21:42  <janzert> antimatroid1: if I'm correctly understanding you're saying the logic in this version is correct? http://pastebin.com/wc8C4FHx it just needs the obvious bugs corrected
2011-03-26T04:24:22  <janzert> if so doesn't that break on a.|.b still? since at the first check of * in a*|.b, 'a' will mark * as being checked/seen and 'b' won't get added to the list ants to check the distance against
2011-03-26T04:24:39  <antimatroid1> janzert: what?
2011-03-26T04:24:50  <antimatroid1> can you look at this link http://pastebin.com/H2SH8kMV
2011-03-26T04:25:31  <antimatroid1> you can't add that n_loc to squares_to_check more than once
2011-03-26T04:25:43  <janzert> that's what you pushed to the repo right?
2011-03-26T04:25:45  <janzert> right
2011-03-26T04:26:09  <antimatroid1> the link you gave?
2011-03-26T04:26:22  <antimatroid1> the one i gave is the one i tried to push
2011-03-26T04:26:25  <janzert> I think the check for that as "if not vision[n_row][n_col][0]:" does the same thing though (and will be quite a bit faster)
2011-03-26T04:26:51  <janzert> ok, I thought you had decided to revert the logic back to the previous version
2011-03-26T04:26:52  <antimatroid1> it's not
2011-03-26T04:27:14  <antimatroid1> i don't mark vision..[0] until i take c_loc off squares_to_check
2011-03-26T04:28:43  <antimatroid1> what i could do is add it, but if visited[cloc][0] then don't do anything
2011-03-26T04:28:47  <antimatroid1> i'll see how fast that is
2011-03-26T04:31:00  <antimatroid1> still pretty slow
2011-03-26T04:31:31  <janzert> is it giving the correct result though?
2011-03-26T04:32:24  <antimatroid1> no
2011-03-26T04:32:34  <antimatroid1> it just gave me messy output at like turn 34 :\
2011-03-26T04:32:48  <antimatroid1> 31*
2011-03-26T04:33:03  <janzert> I think the check at line 177 has to go away
2011-03-26T04:34:02  <janzert> btw, you've got a whole passel full of extra whitespace at the end of line 180 :}

2011-03-26T12:15:48  <antimatroid> i hate liqupur
2011-03-26T12:16:00  <McLeopold> maybe janzert could explain what happened last night...
2011-03-26T12:16:32  <McLeopold> there's lots of talk on irc, then suddenly sigh commits stuff we had ruled out as too slow 2 month ago?
2011-03-26T12:30:16  <janzert> the algorithm that was checked in was buggy, while antimatroid was working on fixing it sigh tried this one out and found it to be faster anyway. Certainly this one is O(n_squares_an_ant_sees * number_of_ants) and the other would be O(n_squares_visible_to_ants), but for our game I'm not sure the constant overhead of the second ever gets it below the first.
2011-03-26T12:31:31  <janzert> of course pathological case favoring the latter is with a solid block of ants
2011-03-26T12:31:56  <McLeopold> janzert: that is the same algo I started with, before the painting one, and it was much slower in my tests
2011-03-26T12:32:18  <janzert> ok, I'm just going by what sigh reported last night
2011-03-26T12:44:47  <_flag> Question: if you're concerned about performance why choose python?
2011-03-26T12:45:46  <antimatroid> what flag said :P
2011-03-26T12:45:58  <antimatroid> c++ or c would be much faster
2011-03-26T12:46:09  <_flag> Or even java
2011-03-26T12:47:12  <_flag> Any compiled language would would work really (yes I know java is compiled to bytecode)
2011-03-26T12:48:04  <janzert> I think we're only worried about performance of the constant overhead from using python but the possible really bad degradation from algorithmic complexity
2011-03-26T12:48:05  <_flag> But I would prefer C or C++
2011-03-26T12:48:56  <janzert> i.e. we can live with 20 or even 100 times slower but not having it blow up in a 2**n time algorithm
2011-03-26T12:49:27  <janzert> or n**n ;)
2011-03-26T12:49:51  <_flag> By all means, do both (if it's not too late to change now that is)
2011-03-26T12:50:09  <janzert> and that part doesn't matter what language you're using
2011-03-26T12:50:54  <_flag> Sure, but sometimes you need computationally expensive algorithmns
2011-03-26T12:51:28  <janzert> and they'll be expensive everywhere
2011-03-26T12:51:46  <janzert> err, s/only/not in my first statement
2011-03-26T12:52:28  <_flag> Yes, but up to a few hundred times less expensive with a compiled language
2011-03-26T12:52:51  <_flag> At the end of the day, that's more servers and less games, fancy algorithmns or not
2011-03-26T12:53:13  <janzert> is the engine really adding that much overhead now?
2011-03-26T12:54:08  <jbroman> If the system to run the game is so slow that it adds significant overhead compared to multiple bots, then something is wrong. But that's more of a "what is it doing?" issue than a language issue.

2011-03-26T12:56:53  <amstan> we could potentially use C code for the vision
2011-03-26T12:58:26  <McLeopold> amstan: for zeta, if we have an engine that runs the game like a bot, with stdin/out communication, then the game can be written in any language
2011-03-26T12:59:30  <McLeopold> And yes, I'd like to see a compiled game class for this contest if possible.  I was hoping to make a clisp version :)
2011-03-26T13:00:10  <McLeopold> Of course it would be easier to use a c game class with python extensions...
2011-03-26T13:02:20  <McLeopold> @later tell sigh: I've reverted to the painting algo in the starter bot, but not the engine.  I think we could come up with a hybrid algo for vision if we really need it.
2011-03-26T13:02:20  <contestbot> McLeopold: Job's done.
2011-03-26T13:02:26  <Frontier> And in a "we have to attack Cartago" fashion, I would like to express my concern about full pipe buffers in the communication between engine and bots again. Does the engine kick a bot that doesn't read its input when the data is > 4KB?
2011-03-26T13:03:24  <McLeopold> Frontier: I wrote the engine to start reading the bot's input if time allowed and to try and get as much as possible before checking the time again.
2011-03-26T13:03:45  <McLeopold> But we can't let a bot that sends infinite info break the engine, so we need a sane cutoff
2011-03-26T13:04:26  <janzert> eek, all the radius variables in Ants are actually radius**2
2011-03-26T13:04:26  <McLeopold> We might be talking about different things...
2011-03-26T13:04:37  <Frontier> I think about the other extreme: The engine sends 6KB of data to the bot, but the bot lets the pipe run full and stalls the engine-.
2011-03-26T13:04:48  <McLeopold> janert: yes, so it's integers all the way down
2011-03-26T13:05:29  <janzert> those are pretty misleadingly named then
2011-03-26T13:05:44  <McLeopold> Frontier: I'm not sure how we would fix that in python.
2011-03-26T13:06:15  <McLeopold> janzert: %s/viewradius/viewradius2/g ?
2011-03-26T13:06:35  <janzert> youuse a separate thread to do the write so it doesn't actually stall the whole engine right?
2011-03-26T13:06:52  <janzert> that would save confusion I think
2011-03-26T13:06:56  <McLeopold> I used sandbox and trusted whoever wrote it did a good job.

2011-03-26T13:21:01  <McLeopold> janzert: what's the error?
2011-03-26T13:21:42  <janzert> vision distance is defined with self like it is a method but its defined as an inner function of the visible method
2011-03-26T13:21:58  <janzert> if I'm reading it all correctly
2011-03-26T13:22:30  <McLeopold> oh crap, i mixed spaces and tabs :O
2011-03-26T13:22:44  <jmcarthur> boegel: yes! i don't have as much time to work on it as i had originally hoped for. it is in desparate need of documentation, examples, more functionality, and a lot of testing. i think bss has some patches with documentation that he hasn't sent me yet, so if you decide to tackle that aspect then you might want to as him about that first so you don't end up doing redundant work
2011-03-26T13:23:17  <janzert> well your call to it on line 230 is like its a function not a method
2011-03-26T13:23:47  <jmcarthur> the interface is also not yet easy to understand. i'm planning to make an all-in-one module that provides all the functionality in one monad so that if you don't care to compose your own you don't have to
2011-03-26T13:24:39  <McLeopold> janzert: it is a function local to the method, so that should be correct
2011-03-26T13:25:45  <janzert> ok, it either shouldn't take a self argument or you need to explicitly pass it in right?
2011-03-26T13:25:58  <McLeopold> oops, yes, remove self from the argument list
2011-03-26T13:26:43  <McLeopold> it should still get a reference to self

2011-03-26T13:47:02  <McLeopold> janzert: AIM.keys() maybe
2011-03-26T13:47:52  <janzert> well, "for d in AIM:" is the same as "for d in AIM.keys():" so if you're really wanting to iterate on the keys then it is correct
2011-03-26T13:48:23  <janzert> I just thought the keys were ("n", "e", "w", "s")
2011-03-26T13:48:40  <McLeopold> they are
2011-03-26T13:48:54  <McLeopold> and d is passed to destination() , which takes a char

2011-03-26T19:22:42  <McLeopold> hi
2011-03-26T19:23:05  <janzert> so I put together a little script to do some timing tests between the two vision algorithms. with viewradius2 set to 6, once any space starts getting added between ants it's really hard for the "by_square"/painting algorithm to be faster than the brute force "by_ant" algorithm
2011-03-26T19:23:07  <sigh> the painting algorithm doesn't work
2011-03-26T19:23:26  <sigh> or did you guys figure something else out?
2011-03-26T19:23:31  <janzert> sigh: McLeopold fixed it
2011-03-26T19:23:53  <janzert> at least so far as I've found it works now
2011-03-26T19:24:27  <janzert> just pretty much always slower unless you're dealing with a solid block of ants larger than 15x15
2011-03-26T19:25:18  <McLeopold> janzert: viewradius is 96
2011-03-26T19:25:32  <sigh> how did he fix it?
2011-03-26T19:25:42  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/wvD15Q6u is the script I've been testing with
2011-03-26T19:25:43  <McLeopold> sigh: it was using manhatten distance
2011-03-26T19:26:02  <janzert> McLeopold: argh, ok. I'll check with that
2011-03-26T19:26:11  <sigh> McLeopold: ok, sure... but it's still using the painting algorithm
2011-03-26T19:26:18  <sigh> now it is the same as the engine was before
2011-03-26T19:26:41  <McLeopold> did you find another bug besides the distance check?
2011-03-26T19:27:02  <sigh> yes, the painting algo gives the wrong result for
2011-03-26T19:27:03  <sigh> .a
2011-03-26T19:27:04  <sigh> a.
2011-03-26T19:27:57  <McLeopold> what kind of results are you expecting?
2011-03-26T19:28:13  <janzert> sigh: I tried that with McLeopold's version and it works, I'm still not sure why :}
2011-03-26T19:28:31  <sigh> janzert: in the starter pack?
2011-03-26T19:28:33  <janzert> actually I brute forced every combination of 2 ants
2011-03-26T19:28:35  <janzert> yes
2011-03-26T19:28:46  <sigh> hmmm
2011-03-26T19:29:18  <McLeopold> if we are painting vision, and it's a 2x2 map, then all 4 squares should return as visible
2011-03-26T19:29:33  <McLeopold> but I think you are talking about some other type of result?
2011-03-26T19:30:12  <janzert> McLeopold: I tried placing one ant at the center of a 20x20 map and one ant on every other square and checked that the results of the two algorithms match
2011-03-26T19:30:22  <janzert> with viewradius2 at 6 anyway
2011-03-26T19:30:35  <janzert> but I don't think changing that should make a difference
2011-03-26T19:31:13  <sigh> it will
2011-03-26T19:31:18  <sigh> put it to 96
2011-03-26T19:31:25  <McLeopold> I don't see how it could fail.  If the distance check is the same, squares are either turned on or off.  The difference which squares get checked and how often.
2011-03-26T19:31:48  <janzert> ok, but I'll have to rewrite that check since I threw it out already
2011-03-26T19:32:19  <McLeopold> sigh: did you guys produce any text pictures or anything showing the problem?
2011-03-26T19:33:24  <sigh> I showed you the example
2011-03-26T19:33:36  <janzert> btw, with viewradius2 at 96 the crossover solid block of ants is 4x4 for the two algorithms
2011-03-26T19:34:35  <janzert> and the by_square algorithm stays ahead for reasonable sizes with spacing between the ants as well
2011-03-26T19:35:00  <McLeopold> can I get the link again?
2011-03-26T19:35:29  <janzert> the test script I'm using? http://pastebin.com/wvD15Q6u
2011-03-26T19:35:52  <McLeopold> no, I mean sigh's results
2011-03-26T19:36:48  <sigh> McLeopold: hang on, I'll show the picture when I first saw the problem, but it's not very instructive
2011-03-26T19:37:28  <janzert> for a 10x10 block(grid) of ants the crossover is at 4 spaces in between ants, so I'm still not sure that the by_ant algorithm might end up faster in most games :/
2011-03-26T19:37:48  <McLeopold> does this relate to the test_bot issue I've been having where both bots get the same input?
2011-03-26T19:38:09  <McLeopold> janzert: we could put both in and switch at a specific density :)
2011-03-26T19:38:28  <McLeopold> But I think we could make a hybrid as well :)
2011-03-26T19:38:30  <sigh> This is my original example where I noticed the problem
2011-03-26T19:38:31  <sigh> http://pastebin.com/VRm3qcMv and http://pastebin.com/mrrXSEJ0
2011-03-26T19:38:49  <sigh> first line is ant positions, both are the same list of ants but in different order
2011-03-26T19:38:57  <sigh> giving different vision
2011-03-26T19:39:11  <sigh> but then we narrowed it down to ants in the following configuration:
2011-03-26T19:39:12  <sigh> a.
2011-03-26T19:39:13  <sigh> .a
2011-03-26T19:40:12  <McLeopold> oh, so not in a 2x2 map, just relative to each other
2011-03-26T19:41:35  <sigh> yes
2011-03-26T19:41:55  <sigh> assume wrapping is not a concern :)
2011-03-26T19:43:03  <McLeopold> my gut says we should paint all 8 squares around the ant
2011-03-26T19:43:08  <McLeopold> not just 4
2011-03-26T19:43:09  <janzert> sigh: you're right it has a problem with viewradius2 = 96
2011-03-26T19:43:17  <sigh> told you :)
2011-03-26T19:44:26  <McLeopold> janzert: what is the distance and offsets of the square not being painted?
2011-03-26T19:44:54  <janzert> just a sec, all I've got is that the output of the algorithms don't match right now

2011-03-26T20:03:49  <janzert> yep
2011-03-26T20:04:11  <janzert> maybe a utilities directory or..? I'm not really sure what to call it :P

2011-03-26T20:23:03  <janzert> otherwise the blocking ant fills in all the squares that would have been anyway

2011-03-26T22:43:40  <sigh> janzert: I implemented a vision algorithm that appears to work and faster than either by_ants or by_squares, please have a look if you have the chance ^^
2011-03-26T22:44:22  <sigh> timings: by_ant: 10.26ms, by_square: 9.00ms, by_distance (new): 0.74ms

2011-03-26T22:49:49  <Frontier> 0.74 sounded good
2011-03-26T22:49:59  <sigh> :)
2011-03-26T22:50:26  <Frontier> can i use this algorithm for the visualizer?
2011-03-26T22:51:22  <Frontier> nah, maybe it is too heavy for javascript
2011-03-26T22:51:25  <sigh> Frontier: have you been following what's been going on with the vision algorithm?
2011-03-26T22:51:44  <Frontier> some of it.
2011-03-26T22:51:56  <sigh> I recommend just using the by_ant one for now
2011-03-26T22:52:11  <sigh> it's simple and it works
2011-03-26T22:52:52  <Frontier> I'm currently checking all squares in a bounding box around each ant. if they are in radius, they are visible

2011-03-26T22:53:52  <sigh> Frontier: yeah, that's essentially what by_ant does, but it is optimised a bit for how python does things
2011-03-26T22:54:21  <Frontier> but javascript is nasty when you try to optimize it like c. especially nested array lookups are extremly slow. map[precalc_row[i]][precalc_col[i]] didn't gain me anything
2011-03-26T22:54:33  <Frontier> *replace the second i with k
2011-03-26T22:55:19  <Frontier> well... optimizing for script languages is always a source of joy :-/
2011-03-26T22:56:02  <sigh> what is precalc_row?
2011-03-26T22:56:07  <Frontier> It turns out to be: "just write the shortest code, don't try use lookup tables" for js
2011-03-26T22:56:21  <Frontier> wait...
2011-03-26T22:57:31  <Frontier> http://pastebin.com/U7n8XJFP
2011-03-26T22:59:13  <Frontier> row and col is the ant location. this turned out to be slightly faster than my naive approach in all browsers. but it depends much on which js implementation you use
2011-03-26T22:59:35  <Frontier> chrome currently leaves everything else behind by far
2011-03-26T22:59:40  <sigh> :)
2011-03-26T22:59:53  <sigh> have you tried firefox 4?
2011-03-26T23:00:17  <Frontier> i would not need to optimize anything for chrome, but opera is rather slow. slower than even Rhino, the Java implementation
2011-03-26T23:00:46  <antimatroid> .. have we considered interplayer communication?
2011-03-26T23:01:01  <Frontier> antimatroid: long ago, sure
2011-03-26T23:01:10  <antimatroid> that was interant wasn't it?
2011-03-26T23:01:31  <Frontier> sigh: Firefox 4 hasn't been on the list, but ff 3 it is only 2x faster than Rhino
2011-03-26T23:02:03  <sigh> ff4 is supposed to be a lot faster than ff3
2011-03-26T23:02:45  <Frontier> 6 times faster??! can they keep their marketing promises?
2011-03-26T23:03:43  <sigh> hehe
2011-03-26T23:04:39  <Frontier> omg! it parses replays 4 times faster, wtf?

2011-03-26T23:08:31  <Frontier> *address
2011-03-26T23:08:37  <jbroman> Frontier: links opened from a tab are automatically children, and you can manually reorganize.
2011-03-26T23:08:58  <jbroman> This means that it's roughly a directed graph of which links you clicked on.
2011-03-26T23:09:03  <sigh> that's how I have it set up ^^, but you can get it to organise by domain
2011-03-26T23:09:17  <Frontier> awesome plugin
2011-03-26T23:09:40  <jbroman> I've used it for some time. I've had 150+ tabs open with it.
2011-03-26T23:09:43  <sigh> it means, for example, all my reddit browsing is under the one branch
2011-03-26T23:09:49  <jbroman> (And 2 GB of RAM used by Firefox to match that.)

2011-03-26T23:14:11  <antimatroid> browsers are such memory hogs these days

2011-03-26T23:15:43  <antimatroid> i know, but does anyone think it's worth keeping a history of all closed tabs so that you pretty much can't just indefinitely leave a browser running? :P
2011-03-26T23:16:10  <sigh> it doesn't keep them in memory, does it?
2011-03-26T23:16:28  <antimatroid> dunno, probably not, but something chews up a lot of memory with browsers these days
2011-03-26T23:16:38  <antimatroid> and i noticed it around the time that came in, so i've always blamed that :)
2011-03-26T23:17:01  <sigh> haha, post hoc ergo propter hoc
2011-03-26T23:18:40  <sigh> does chrome eat up a lot of memory? I've never had it running for extended lengths of time
2011-03-26T23:21:54  <antimatroid> it uses less than firefox did
2011-03-26T23:21:57  <antimatroid> that's the main reason i use chrome
2011-03-26T23:21:58  <Frontier> hmm, you could configure ram cache usage, but removing 'old' tabs from memory would be a good thing. of course you would have to trigger that manually if the page contained long running applications like browser games in flash with login.
2011-03-26T23:22:26  <antimatroid> plus the tabs are right up the top, so you have more window space
2011-03-26T23:23:10  <sigh> ff4 has squashed things down a it, although chrome still has more I think
2011-03-26T23:23:16  <Frontier> opera has the tabs at the top, too. but they did not dare to suppress the window manager borders
2011-03-26T23:23:41  <sigh> ff4 is very chromey :P
2011-03-26T23:24:07  <Frontier> sure, it would suck for them if the good features in chrome made everyone switch ;)
2011-03-26T23:24:16  <sigh> :)
2011-03-26T23:24:27  <antimatroid> do the browsers hate each other copying like that?
2011-03-26T23:24:29  <Frontier> fast javascript just beeing one key point
2011-03-26T23:24:36  <antimatroid> i think it's good if they all sort of go with what people like most
2011-03-26T23:24:43  <antimatroid> it'd push them all to do better as well
2011-03-26T23:24:46  <sigh> antimatroid: if that was the case, then Opera are pissed

2011-03-26T23:40:19  <sigh> .b.
2011-03-26T23:40:23  <antimatroid> if you have vision = 1.5 and you paint from the top a first?
2011-03-26T23:40:27  <sigh> b is closer to c than a, right?
2011-03-26T23:40:28  <antimatroid> wont you say c is not visible?
2011-03-26T23:40:58  <antimatroid> well, sqrt(2) anyway
2011-03-26T23:41:06  <sigh> but b can get to c via the other route
2011-03-26T23:41:10  <sigh> hmmm
2011-03-26T23:41:14  <sigh> that can be blocked
2011-03-26T23:41:23  <antimatroid> yeah okay, but can that break?
2011-03-26T23:41:41  <antimatroid> that was what i thought was breaking the old method?
2011-03-26T23:42:27  <sigh> nah, old method was broken because of the shape
2011-03-26T23:42:29  <sigh> hang on
2011-03-26T23:42:44  <sigh> http://pastebin.com/gscdvw3u
2011-03-26T23:42:57  <sigh> that shows why the old method breaks
2011-03-26T23:44:31  <antimatroid> why did the old method break there?
2011-03-26T23:44:49  <antimatroid> oh, it depended on the order for checking *?
2011-03-26T23:44:59  <sigh> yes
2011-03-26T23:45:08  <sigh> see, the squares directly below 'a' are equal manhatten distance from 'b' but some of them are closer eucliean distance to 'b'
2011-03-26T23:45:51  <antimatroid> so why does that not break now?

2011-03-26T23:46:13  <sigh> because it searches in order of euclidean distance
2011-03-26T23:46:36  <sigh> although you've got me thinking it breaks for a different reason now
2011-03-26T23:46:55  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-26T23:47:07  <sigh> a.c
2011-03-26T23:47:10  <sigh> .b.
2011-03-26T23:47:11  <sigh> ..a
2011-03-26T23:47:59  <sigh> if both 'a's are before 'b', then the path to c is completely blocked
2011-03-26T23:48:18  <sigh> and if the viewradius is only sqrt(2) then 'c' won't be marked as visible
2011-03-26T23:48:22  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-26T23:48:42  <antimatroid> can we find a euclidean distance that doesn't break the old method?
2011-03-26T23:49:09  <antimatroid> otherwise i think we need to seriously consider changing it
2011-03-26T23:49:13  <sigh> what do you mean?
2011-03-26T23:49:29  <antimatroid> make it so that such a * square isn't in the view radius
2011-03-26T23:50:21  <antimatroid> i'll pull out the pacer and see where i get
2011-03-26T23:50:33  <sigh> dunno, but I think you can fix the new method

2011-03-26T23:51:40  <antimatroid> by storing a list of people who can equally reach a square?
2011-03-26T23:51:45  <antimatroid> that's what i did, it was SLOW
2011-03-26T23:52:07  <sigh> no, not by doing that

2011-03-26T23:53:02  <antimatroid> ideally the method shouldn't be too complicated to explain to people
2011-03-26T23:53:20  <antimatroid> because it's a pretty obvious thing most people need to do
2011-03-26T23:53:42  <sigh> oh, in any case I think the starter packs should have the naive working method
2011-03-26T23:54:32  <antimatroid> i don't think we should give people functions that aren't correct
2011-03-26T23:54:51  <antimatroid> or very naive paint from every ant sequentially?
2011-03-26T23:54:54  <sigh> yes
2011-03-26T23:55:01  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-03-26T23:55:15  <antimatroid> it might be worth noting people should be careful if they try to make it more efficient
2011-03-26T23:55:21  <antimatroid> and to go look at ants.py
2011-03-26T23:55:21  <sigh> yes
2011-03-26T23:55:30  <sigh> the advantage is that we KNOW it works
2011-03-26T23:55:50  <spacebat> I just saw a post about the ants repo being up, so I cloned it but it seems its still in development - or is there something I'm missing?
2011-03-26T23:56:03  <sigh> if we find a bug it is easy to fix the engine, harder to fix starter packs that others downloaded
2011-03-26T23:56:04  <antimatroid> spacebat: it's still being made, but you can run games
2011-03-26T23:56:17  <antimatroid> spacebat: try running the play_one_game.sh/bat files
2011-03-26T23:56:27  <antimatroid> then inspect its contents and work stuff out from there
2011-03-26T23:56:51  <spacebat> the README.md scared me off because it said that the setup procedure makes invasive changes to the system
2011-03-26T23:57:03  <spacebat> but I assum that's just for contest servers
2011-03-26T23:57:03  <sigh> spacebat: no, that's for setting up the CONTEST
2011-03-26T23:57:08  <sigh> :)
2011-03-26T23:57:16  <spacebat> ok
2011-03-26T23:57:24  <Frontier> spacebat: at some point we might have a make file in the top level that generates the server image
2011-03-26T23:57:31  <spacebat> yup
2011-03-26T23:57:59  <sigh> spacebat: just look at the ants/ directory, that has the stuff that actually plays the game
2011-03-26T23:58:11  <spacebat> running it now
2011-03-26T23:58:13  <Frontier> but somehow i like the big red button thing that just takes control of your computer and turns it into a contest server.
2011-03-26T23:58:22  <sigh> hehe :)
2011-03-26T23:59:09  <antimatroid> sigh: you can't eliminate the issue with euclidean metric and the kinds of view radius we want

2011-03-26T23:59:40  <antimatroid> well, the only time you can is when it's small enough that the vision is equivalent to the manhatten
2011-03-26T23:59:41  <Frontier> spacebat: there is also a visualizer directory with an offline.html that you can use to load .replay files into.
