2011-04-06T03:04:35  <antimatroid> strata*
2011-04-06T03:05:18  <Keth> :3
2011-04-06T03:06:44  <antimatroid> if you have a group G and a set X with x in X, the orbit of x is orb_G(x ) = {g.x: g in G}
2011-04-06T03:07:03  <antimatroid> then you have a stabiliser set, so a strata is a set of orbits such that the stabiliser groups are the same
2011-04-06T03:07:48  <Keth> antimatroid: I see.
2011-04-06T03:07:51  <antimatroid> at least i think, like i said rank :P trying to work out wtf i'm doing

2011-04-06T03:08:44  <antimatroid> i have to find the 3 different strata for G = O(1,1) and X = R^2
2011-04-06T03:08:51  <antimatroid> it's an assignment question :P
2011-04-06T03:09:01  <Keth> Is that for your AI?
2011-04-06T03:09:02  <Keth> or school?
2011-04-06T03:09:06  <antimatroid> for school
2011-04-06T03:09:48  <Keth> I never studied astronomy
2011-04-06T03:10:06  <antimatroid> this is group theory (maths)
2011-04-06T03:10:18  <antimatroid> it's technically a physics unit, but i haven't done any physics before, it's really all maths
2011-04-06T03:11:00  <Keth> I can do physics and maths pretty well, except I'm not familiar with the English terms such as stabiliser groups'
2011-04-06T03:11:20  <Keth> I haven't studied maths in English
2011-04-06T03:11:30  <antimatroid> where are you from?
2011-04-06T03:12:17  <Keth> I speak Polish, then I spent some time in Sweden and currently living in England
2011-04-06T03:12:19  <antimatroid> i'm disappointed by the lack of (not really sure what else to say) asians around for these
2011-04-06T03:12:29  <antimatroid> i want to get the japanese more interested at least
2011-04-06T03:12:35  <Keth> Are you Asian?
2011-04-06T03:12:43  <antimatroid> no, i'm from Tasmania in Australia
2011-04-06T03:12:53  <Keth> Ah

2011-04-06T03:13:15  <antimatroid> google is very much just a sponsor name

2011-04-06T03:15:30  <Keth_> aha, i see
2011-04-06T03:15:31  <antimatroid> and i did a lot of the wiki stuff
2011-04-06T03:15:41  <Keth_> were you the one I spoke about the C++ starter bot and how it's lacking the structure?

2011-04-06T05:43:33  <Keth_> well, it's not that important but it would be really helpful to do some loop outputting into different files

2011-04-06T06:01:16  <sigh> Keth_: nevermind, I think I found the problem
2011-04-06T06:02:02  <Keth_> =D
2011-04-06T06:02:35  <sigh> actually, no :(
2011-04-06T06:02:56  <Keth_> D=
2011-04-06T06:03:22  <Keth_> I'm testing the old revisions
2011-04-06T06:03:28  <Keth_> I have one on my hard drive that was working

2011-04-06T06:03:54  <sigh> Keth_: are you running with the --output viewer option, or not?
2011-04-06T06:04:09  <Keth_> I tried both
2011-04-06T06:04:11  <Keth_> they both give error
2011-04-06T06:04:21  <Keth_> (same error to clarify)
2011-04-06T06:04:26  <Keth_> :)
2011-04-06T06:04:46  <sigh> well, they should give errors in different places :P
2011-04-06T06:04:54  <Keth_> nope, same place.
2011-04-06T06:05:08  <sigh> really? o_O
2011-04-06T06:05:16  <Keth_> (double checking)
2011-04-06T06:06:23  <Keth_> replay, stream or json?
2011-04-06T06:07:37  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~chatzilla@host-81-20-37-12.eckoh.com> has joined #aichallenge

2011-04-06T06:07:41  <Keth_> json gives no error and replay is OK but the output.txt is 0 bytes
2011-04-06T06:07:50  <Keth_> stream gives instant error
2011-04-06T06:08:11  <sigh> Keth_: I'm interested in the difference between having the --output_dir viewer option and not having it
2011-04-06T06:08:25  <sigh> say with --replay stream (just to make it fail quicker)
2011-04-06T06:08:29  <Keth_> okay
2011-04-06T06:08:54  <Keth_> both exactly same errors, instantly
2011-04-06T06:09:02  <Keth_> with and without --output_dir viewer
2011-04-06T06:09:07  <Keth_> wait
2011-04-06T06:09:22  <Keth_> Yes
2011-04-06T06:10:35  <sigh> it gives the same line number and everything?
2011-04-06T06:11:45  <Keth_> you're right, one line differs, it's missing. let me paste
2011-04-06T06:12:07  <Keth_> http://pastebin.com/kX2QNqaC
2011-04-06T06:12:25  <sigh> thought so :)
2011-04-06T06:12:25  <Keth_> was hard to spot it
2011-04-06T06:12:46  <sigh> Keth_: yeah, that's why I emphasised exact :)
2011-04-06T06:12:50  <Keth_> I knew you're looking at the code so I guessed you know better
2011-04-06T06:12:53  <Keth_> yeah
2011-04-06T06:13:41  <Keth_> I'm not AI to spot a difference the first attempt =D
2011-04-06T06:13:50  <sigh> :)
2011-04-06T06:14:08  <Keth_> So do you know what's wrong?
2011-04-06T06:14:22  <sigh> seems like your system doesn't like when I do a .write() call to sys.stdout... which is really wierd
2011-04-06T06:14:34  <Keth_> Windows has no such thing as sys.stdout though
2011-04-06T06:14:36  <Keth_> you should consider that
2011-04-06T06:14:51  <Keth_> It might use some wrapper/emulates that under windows
2011-04-06T06:14:55  <sigh> yeah, but python works around that
2011-04-06T06:14:59  <Keth_> exactly
2011-04-06T06:15:07  <sigh> I've got it working on my windows vm
2011-04-06T06:15:12  <Keth_> Huh?
2011-04-06T06:15:16  <Keth_> You got it working?
2011-04-06T06:15:22  <sigh> yeah
2011-04-06T06:15:27  <Keth_> Windows XP?
2011-04-06T06:15:43  <sigh> yes
2011-04-06T06:15:48  <Keth_> interesting
2011-04-06T06:15:51  <sigh> hmm... python 2.6.6 though
2011-04-06T06:15:57  <Keth_> Oh yeah
2011-04-06T06:15:57  <sigh> you were running 2.7, yeah?
2011-04-06T06:15:59  <Keth_> Well
2011-04-06T06:16:01  <sigh> I'll try 2.7
2011-04-06T06:16:04  <Keth_> I had 3.2, it didnd't work
2011-04-06T06:16:06  <Keth_> at all
2011-04-06T06:16:12  <Keth_> so i downgraded to 2.7 I think and it worked
2011-04-06T06:16:18  <Keth_> let me see
2011-04-06T06:16:18  <sigh> yeah, 3 and 2 are completely incomptible
2011-04-06T06:16:38  <Keth_> C:\Program Files (x86)\ICW>python
2011-04-06T06:16:38  <Keth_> Python 2.7 (r27:82525, Jul  4 2010, 09:01:59) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
2011-04-06T06:16:51  <Keth_> I could try 2.6.6 if you want me to
2011-04-06T06:17:00  <Keth_> and I have XP machine next to me
2011-04-06T06:17:04  <Keth_> you choose.
2011-04-06T06:17:57  <Keth_> or you could upgrade to 2.7 and see
2011-04-06T06:18:12  <sigh> I will run 2.7 to try to replicate the problem
2011-04-06T06:18:30  <sigh> but 2.6.6 is what is going to be on the contest servers from my understanding anyway
2011-04-06T06:19:24  <Keth_> let me know if how 2.7 works out
2011-04-06T06:20:05  <sigh> yup, I'll check it later, gtg for now
2011-04-06T06:20:10  <Keth_> sure
2011-04-06T06:20:15  <Keth_> Thanks for help
2011-04-06T06:28:58  <Keth_> fyi, downgrading to 2.6.6 and double checking the version doesn't resolve it
2011-04-06T06:32:18  <antimatroid> Keth_: you are on xp?
2011-04-06T06:32:38  <antimatroid> i was until a few weeks ago, i finally switched to ubuntu
2011-04-06T06:32:52  <antimatroid> seems we do a lot of things the same :P abuse operator overloading, c++, windows..

2011-04-06T08:04:52  <Keth> Frontier: Explain a little further, you mean outputting playgame.py result into a file?
2011-04-06T08:05:44  <Frontier> I mean, I have a bot that outputs debug information. Where can I find that after a game?
2011-04-06T08:06:11  <Keth> That's up to your bot, depends on your bot code. You should know where it saves if it's your code.
2011-04-06T08:06:20  <Keth> Which starter package are you using?
2011-04-06T08:06:21  <sigh> Frontier: can't yet... will have to be implemented
2011-04-06T08:06:31  <Keth> <never mind>
2011-04-06T08:07:03  <Keth> But it can be implemented inside the bot on your own, right?
2011-04-06T08:07:17  <sigh> sure, just write to a log file
2011-04-06T08:07:35  <Keth> yeah
2011-04-06T08:08:07  <Keth> sigh: I ran your thing up there, let me know if you need any more testing
2011-04-06T08:10:17  <sigh> I don't really know what else to do :( that produced another error altogether. If you have time, write up an issue about it, maybe someone else will be able to figure it out
2011-04-06T08:11:53  <Keth> okay, I will figure it out then and let you know
2011-04-06T08:14:47  <Keth> sigh: just figured it out
2011-04-06T08:15:01  <Keth> play_one_game.cmd needs a fix
2011-04-06T08:16:22  <Keth> should be "python playgame.py" not "playgame.py"
2011-04-06T08:17:01  <Keth> so the bat always worked but not for output with >
2011-04-06T08:17:03  <Keth> works perfect now :)
2011-04-06T08:17:08  <sigh> o_O
2011-04-06T08:17:42  <sigh> I don't know anything about bat files
2011-04-06T08:17:46  <Keth> haha
2011-04-06T08:18:01  <Keth> well, the bat WORKED
2011-04-06T08:18:21  <Keth> I just didn't realize it could be bat fault when you see the output in the console
2011-04-06T08:18:30  <sigh> ahhhh
2011-04-06T08:18:44  <sigh> so with the bat, sys.stdout is not set?
2011-04-06T08:18:49  <sigh> or something like that
2011-04-06T08:18:56  <Keth> basically what it tries to do is
2011-04-06T08:19:01  <Keth> same thing as test1.txt > test2.txt
2011-04-06T08:19:08  <Keth> instead of
2011-04-06T08:19:15  <Keth> python x > output.txt
2011-04-06T08:19:56  <sigh> what does "test1.txt > test2.txt" do?
2011-04-06T08:20:15  <Keth> copies
2011-04-06T08:20:21  <Keth> and runs
2011-04-06T08:20:22  <Keth> WOW
2011-04-06T08:20:24  <Keth> haha
2011-04-06T08:20:27  <Keth> that explains it
2011-04-06T08:20:31  <sigh> O_o
2011-04-06T08:20:41  <Keth> test1.txt > ewq
2011-04-06T08:20:45  <Keth> it runs test1.txt in notepad
2011-04-06T08:20:48  <Keth> and ewq is created empty
2011-04-06T08:21:47  <Keth> well, it makes sense.
2011-04-06T08:22:01  <Keth> somebody just needs to fix play_one_game.cmd in the gik
2011-04-06T08:24:29  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold Keth says that "playgame.py" should be replaced by "python playgame.py" in play_one_game.cmd to avoid errors when redirecting output from it
2011-04-06T08:24:29  <contestbot> sigh: Yes master!
2011-04-06T08:25:37  <Keth> I'm just wondering how the hell did it work for you on your vmware machine
2011-04-06T08:25:40  <Keth> =D
2011-04-06T08:26:00  <sigh> dunno, maybe it's an XP vs win7 issue
2011-04-06T08:26:20  <Keth> hm, could be
2011-04-06T08:28:43  <Frontier> It is strange, but I cant seem to run Java bots in the engine
2011-04-06T08:29:32  <Frontier> The bots use System.out.println(); System.out.flush(); but in 0.botN.output there is nothing but the '# turn x' lines
2011-04-06T08:30:11  <Keth> You need to create new file using in your bot code
2011-04-06T08:30:21  <Keth> open 'debug.log' and then put all your logs into that file
2011-04-06T08:30:27  <Keth> don't do print
2011-04-06T08:30:43  <Frontier> Keth: I'm talking about the communication with the engine.
2011-04-06T08:30:49  <sigh> he's printing bot orders
2011-04-06T08:31:05  <Keth> hm okay. But why would you want to contact the engine?
2011-04-06T08:31:18  <sigh> to tell it the move to make :P
2011-04-06T08:31:19  <Frontier> The bot just seems to stay at one spot, but I doesn't time out
2011-04-06T08:31:42  <Keth> ah I understand now
2011-04-06T08:32:41  <Keth> Frontier: are you on windows?
2011-04-06T08:32:42  <needsch> hi, when will the new contest start?
2011-04-06T08:32:50  <sigh> Frontier: that's odd... if it is not timing out it must be outputting "go"
2011-04-06T08:33:10  <needsch> or is the ants specification already fixed?
2011-04-06T08:34:22  <sigh> Frontier: is your bot outputting valid moves?
2011-04-06T08:34:38  <sigh> 0.botN.output only shows the valid moves that a bot has made
2011-04-06T08:36:49  <Frontier> sigh: ok... I am using the starter bot for an experiment
2011-04-06T08:37:03  <sigh> in the next few days I'll make the bot output show the complete stdout and stderr of the bot
2011-04-06T08:38:07  <Frontier> sigh: The bot outputs col/row is that correct?
2011-04-06T08:38:31  <Keth> remember col/row != x,y - took me ages to get used to
2011-04-06T08:38:35  <Keth> =D
2011-04-06T08:38:54  <sigh> Frontier: "o row col direction" eg "0 1 2 n"
2011-04-06T08:39:03  <sigh> sorry: "o 1 2 n"
2011-04-06T08:39:29  <sigh> and it is row/col not col/row
2011-04-06T08:40:33  <Keth> sigh: What could cause a bot to win on the same map and then lose with the same seed in both games? It shouldn't happen right?
2011-04-06T08:41:18  <Frontier> sigh: who is responsible for the java starter?
2011-04-06T08:41:19  <sigh> Keth: are you running the python starter bots?
2011-04-06T08:41:29  <Keth> I'm running my own bots
2011-04-06T08:41:36  <Keth> are you saying my own bots might not be deteministic?
2011-04-06T08:41:42  <Keth> oh that's true
2011-04-06T08:41:46  <Keth> the enemy bot has crazy code
2011-04-06T08:42:09  <Keth> thanks, that explains it
2011-04-06T08:42:10  <sigh> Keth: a seed option is passed in to the bot if the engine is using a seed
2011-04-06T08:42:25  <Keth> Yeah, but the bot I'm fighting with has it's own seed every game
2011-04-06T08:42:27  <Keth> I forgot that

2011-04-06T08:42:58  <Keth> since i got surprised when one of the games went different
2011-04-06T08:43:50  <sigh> yeah, it's the bot's responsibility to seed their random number generator if a seed is passed in
2011-04-06T08:44:13  <Keth> would that be legal if the bot makes up it's own seed?
2011-04-06T08:44:19  <Keth> in a real tournament?
2011-04-06T08:44:22  <sigh> it's only for testing in any case... in the contest the bots wont be passed seeds :)
2011-04-06T08:44:39  <sigh> seed to help make it easier to test only
2011-04-06T08:44:46  <Keth> yeah I see
2011-04-06T08:44:52  <Keth> I thought seed might be used as a proof of bot winning few times
2011-04-06T08:45:03  <Keth> I could say "results are fake, proove it again"
2011-04-06T08:45:03  <Keth> :)
2011-04-06T08:45:08  <sigh> :)
2011-04-06T08:45:35  <Keth> but i doubt that will be the issue
2011-04-06T08:45:53  <sigh> well, no one has brought that up so far... I only implemented seeds so I could do deterministic regression tests
2011-04-06T08:46:02  <Keth> yeah, seed is really helpful
2011-04-06T08:46:15  <Keth> helped me to recompile my code, add changes and go through the same movement again
2011-04-06T08:46:29  <sigh> :)

2011-04-06T08:47:03  <sigh> Frontier: antimatroid hates java :P
2011-04-06T08:47:14  <Frontier> can i haz huge map? like 500x500?
2011-04-06T08:47:14  <sigh> git blame says that McLeopold wrote it
2011-04-06T08:47:38  <Frontier> but antimatroid is head of starter bot department
2011-04-06T08:47:56  <sigh> he is? ok :P)
2011-04-06T08:48:43  <Keth> sigh: last question, in the tournament, what happens if bot0 has 500 ants and bot1 has 10 and they never kill each other
2011-04-06T08:48:55  <Keth> does the bot with 500 ants win?
2011-04-06T08:49:06  <Keth> after like 1000 turns?
2011-04-06T08:49:58  <sigh> seems like it would be a draw
2011-04-06T08:50:31  <Keth> just because the enemy ants are running, creating a fake draft?
2011-04-06T08:50:34  <Keth> lol
2011-04-06T08:51:25  <sigh> the main aim seems to be to kill other ants, in particular so that you can't get ahead in multiplayer by hiding in a corner
2011-04-06T08:51:45  <sigh> but I haven't been in on the scoring discussions much
2011-04-06T08:51:49  <Keth> i see
2011-04-06T08:52:23  <sigh> scoring is still not settled, in any case
2011-04-06T08:52:55  <Keth> will remember
2011-04-06T08:53:43  <sigh> if you want to discuss scoring (or anything related to game rules), harass antimatroid when you see him :)
2011-04-06T08:55:06  <Keth> I might, he's been nice to me

2011-04-06T09:21:39  <Frontier> hehe, that you want to know. but the dark side is hideous
2011-04-06T09:21:55  <sigh> write a whole bunch of stuff?
2011-04-06T09:21:59  <Frontier> Well, compile it and run it on a really large map with 1000 turns
2011-04-06T09:22:09  <Frontier> 500x500 should be fine as a map size
2011-04-06T09:22:37  <Frontier> It writes a debug.txt file to keep you udated on its attack progress
2011-04-06T09:22:47  <Frontier> You'll see what it does then.
2011-04-06T09:24:17  <Frontier> It *may* run into a false positive and just be killed by your engine.
2011-04-06T09:24:57  <sigh> ah ok, you stall on input
2011-04-06T09:25:06  <Frontier> On my Linux setup it runs up to 64kb btw. So you may need a little patience
2011-04-06T09:25:09  <sigh> I'll run it tomorrow and see what it actuall does
2011-04-06T09:26:07  <Frontier> kk, have fun. McLeopold once said there is nothing he can do about it form within Python.
2011-04-06T09:27:14  <sigh> oh well, I don't see it as a big issue... in the last contest the rules were pretty clear that you got disqualified if you tried to fuck with the contest

2011-04-06T13:58:25  <antimatroid> and make him read through both
2011-04-06T13:58:32  <McLeopold1> scoring?
2011-04-06T13:58:45  <antimatroid> people are still complaining about scoring
2011-04-06T13:58:56  <McLeopold1> the scoring is perfect
2011-04-06T13:59:11  <antimatroid> i tend to agree, that can stay as is
2011-04-06T13:59:14  <McLeopold1> I must have missed the complaints?
2011-04-06T13:59:21  <antimatroid> yes :P
2011-04-06T13:59:46  <McLeopold1> is it "why can I win if I hide in the corner, that's unfair" type of complaints?
2011-04-06T13:59:59  <McLeopold1> *can't*
2011-04-06T14:00:26  <antimatroid> no, i'm having trouble remembering them though
2011-04-06T14:00:46  <antimatroid> one argument is to enforce the last participating player automatically wins

2011-04-06T14:05:06  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: how about ants don't die, just race for food?
2011-04-06T14:05:24  <Frontier> and collisions?
2011-04-06T14:05:41  <McLeopold1> who knows
2011-04-06T14:06:00  <McLeopold1> there is no good attack that jeff will approve
2011-04-06T14:06:42  <Frontier> Looks like you resigned on that front ^^
2011-04-06T14:07:11  <Frontier> I think the last version was pretty easy to understand.
2011-04-06T14:07:41  <Frontier> The one where you accumulate damage first and then kill all ants that have received >= 1 dmg point in that turn
2011-04-06T14:08:44  <McLeopold1> So, here is what jeff has told me
2011-04-06T14:08:49  <Frontier> If I were to make up an ai challenge I would probably have multiple leagues with different rule sets.
2011-04-06T14:10:53  <McLeopold1> Don't require players to have to zoom in to determine what happened, Don't make any hidden state determine an ant's death...
2011-04-06T14:11:20  <McLeopold1> Don't make a rule system that can't be discovered by watching a game
2011-04-06T14:11:52  <Frontier> I agree on point 1 :). But point 3 is really bad...
2011-04-06T14:12:03  <McLeopold1> That leaves us with "die if ants are close", and that's it.
2011-04-06T14:12:33  <Frontier> As long as we don't find a way to visualize other rules efficiently
2011-04-06T14:13:17  <McLeopold1> He really wants the 1:1 ratio kills because he thinks it's the only way people will understand the game
2011-04-06T14:13:22  <antimatroid> but what about his proposed kill iterative closest
2011-04-06T14:13:42  <McLeopold1> that was my proposal, not his
2011-04-06T14:13:46  <antimatroid> everyone i have talked to since the introduction of damage has listed that as their preferred option
2011-04-06T14:14:03  <McLeopold1> That involves "hidden state"
2011-04-06T14:14:08  <antimatroid> how?
2011-04-06T14:14:19  <McLeopold1> I'm just the messenger, I don't agree.
2011-04-06T14:14:29  <antimatroid> i don't see how that involved hidden information
2011-04-06T14:14:34  <McLeopold1> I know
2011-04-06T14:14:52  <McLeopold1> but, it does allow blocking
2011-04-06T14:15:11  <antimatroid> only in small situations that can be prevented from happening
2011-04-06T14:15:20  <McLeopold1> the only way to prevent blocking is limit an ants attack to 1 square
2011-04-06T14:15:37  <antimatroid> or not allow passages of width 1 or 2
2011-04-06T14:16:12  <McLeopold1> I thought it was still possible?
2011-04-06T14:16:18  <antimatroid> don't think so
2011-04-06T14:16:26  <McLeopold1> what attack radius?
2011-04-06T14:16:29  <antimatroid> damage with attack radius 1 is better than all ants in range die
2011-04-06T14:16:34  <antimatroid> sqrt 6
2011-04-06T14:18:31  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: Okay, give me a minute and I show blocking with sqrt 6
2011-04-06T14:19:20  <antimatroid> McLeopold1: is the same blocking possible with sqrt4?
2011-04-06T14:22:15  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: I think a solid line of ants of any length will block with sqrt6
2011-04-06T14:23:23  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: a diagonal line blocks sqrt4
2011-04-06T14:24:00  <McLeopold1> basically, if an ant's attack shape has a line on it, you can block any width
2011-04-06T14:26:18  <antimatroid> McLeopold1: why can't an enemy line also break it?
2011-04-06T14:26:28  <antimatroid> oh corridor
2011-04-06T14:26:29  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-04-06T14:26:54  <McLeopold1> I suppose you can take some out, but at a less than 1:1 ratio
2011-04-06T14:27:05  <antimatroid> yes, less than 1:1 is fine
2011-04-06T14:27:17  <antimatroid> if people want to try and set up defensive structures with those qualities, that's fine
2011-04-06T14:27:23  <antimatroid> we just don't want full blocking
2011-04-06T14:27:26  <antimatroid> and i don't think that's possible
2011-04-06T14:27:44  <antimatroid> if we have open enough maps, people should be able to go "around" these things

2011-04-06T14:32:31  <antimatroid> you still have to lift off every word
2011-04-06T14:32:49  <antimatroid> and i'm a maths student, a lot of the time i'm not writing sentences of text
2011-04-06T14:38:17  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: so, take a crack at convincing jeff of the damage rule
2011-04-06T14:40:47  <antimatroid> i think people will avoid fighting when possible without something like damage
2011-04-06T14:40:55  <antimatroid> i guess that ignores scoring
2011-04-06T14:41:05  <antimatroid> but i don't think the scoring makes sense without something like damage either
2011-04-06T14:44:19  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what is preferred if not damage?
2011-04-06T14:44:32  <antimatroid> colliding ants only or all ants within range
2011-04-06T14:45:51  <McLeopold1> colliding?
2011-04-06T14:46:19  <McLeopold1> if your damage contributed to an ants death, you get a percent of that point
2011-04-06T14:47:42  <McLeopold1> that works for any attack method
2011-04-06T14:50:39  <antimatroid> yeah, but in all other methods you don't want to have more than one ant in the fight
2011-04-06T14:50:53  <antimatroid> otherwise you're just losing more ants and giving away more points
2011-04-06T14:51:10  <antimatroid> so fighting basically resolves down to don't send more than one ant
2011-04-06T14:56:42  <McLeopold1> yes, but the scoring method stays the same

2011-04-06T17:45:52  <amstan> made one for myself
2011-04-06T17:45:56  <Frontier> I used them to create a bot that stalls the engine and realized that in some locations it uses col/row format. Espeicially in the construction of Aim enums and when issuing orders.

2011-04-06T17:52:33  <Frontier> So it is possible for a bot to stall the engine, but the case is very unlikely (on my linux at least). The engine would have to send > 64k (size may vary among systems) of data in a single turn, that the bot doesn't read out of the buffer.

2011-04-06T17:57:55  <Keth> or engine to freeze
2011-04-06T17:58:52  <Frontier> This case is easier to handle, and I'm sure the engine can kill a bot that doesn't send a go in time among all the other data it is sending.

2011-04-06T18:18:42  <amstan> yeah, i changed myself back
2011-04-06T18:20:24  <McLeopold> amstan: I was trying to reduce visual noise by making all user tags an orangy-red
2011-04-06T18:20:40  <amstan> oh.. that's ok then
2011-04-06T18:20:41  <McLeopold> then you can glance and see that an issue is assigned or not
2011-04-06T18:20:49  <amstan> good idea
2011-04-06T18:22:47  <McLeopold> amstan: what's the command to reset a fork?
2011-04-06T18:23:00  <amstan> McLeopold: just delete your repo, refork it
2011-04-06T18:26:56  <McLeopold> amstan: done

2011-04-06T18:38:07  <Frontier> McLeopold: funny, I thought the random color generator was broken and that is why everyone is red, so i changed my name to visualizer yellow.
2011-04-06T18:38:53  <McLeopold> :)
2011-04-06T18:45:21  <McLeopold> Frontier: you still show up as orange for me.  It's not user specific is it?
2011-04-06T18:47:09  <Frontier> no, you changed me back to orange
2011-04-06T18:48:24  <McLeopold> oh
2011-04-06T18:48:26  <Frontier> Stocha will have a hard time with your shades of red with green. He is color blind :p
2011-04-06T18:48:33  <McLeopold> :)
2011-04-06T18:48:42  <McLeopold> only zeta is green
2011-04-06T18:49:06  <Frontier> the 'reds' all seem to have a little green in them
2011-04-06T18:49:28  <McLeopold> even I can't tell the reds apart, and that's kinda the point
2011-04-06T18:49:32  <Frontier> I'll have to do something about the visualizer, too
2011-04-06T18:49:52  <McLeopold> I've got 2 links for you to checkout in regards to ant colors
2011-04-06T18:50:30  <McLeopold> http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
2011-04-06T18:51:37  <Frontier> this was my 'tool' so far: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer/colors.html
2011-04-06T18:51:47  <McLeopold> http://blog.asmartbear.com/color-wheels.html?  scroll down to the four primary colors wheel
2011-04-06T18:53:03  <McLeopold> I like your color tool :D
2011-04-06T18:58:29  <Frontier> Solarized is actually intersting. The color wheel and pysiology of the eye is not new to me.
