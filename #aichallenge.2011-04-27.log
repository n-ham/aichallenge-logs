2011-04-27T04:11:44  <antimatroid1> my c++ bot is trying to get "scores" but he said it didn't seem to get anything with "score" either, but that it had it with the replay data or something
2011-04-27T04:11:47  <antimatroid1> neither do i fully
2011-04-27T04:12:01  <sigh> scores are in the replay

2011-04-27T04:22:53  <jaycobcoleman> so much confusion
2011-04-27T04:23:05  <antimatroid> the information is meant to be there for bots testing information
2011-04-27T04:23:16  <antimatroid> bots can be killed off on the website
2011-04-27T04:24:31  <sigh> if you process timesout or is otherwise borked then you aren't send anything
2011-04-27T04:25:06  <sigh> but if you die through the normal course of the game then you are sent the scores at the time of you death
2011-04-27T04:25:20  <sigh> I still don't know what you want and what you expect
2011-04-27T04:25:34  <sigh> I'm going to ignore this until I have a clear definition of what is required
2011-04-27T04:26:02  <sigh> I haven't touched what scores are being sent, what's currently there has not been changed in months
2011-04-27T04:26:12  <antimatroid> yeah i didn't think it had
2011-04-27T04:26:26  <antimatroid> my understanding was that information was for bots to use when "testing/learning" if the wanted
2011-04-27T04:26:36  <antimatroid> so would have thought one would give the bots information at the end
2011-04-27T04:27:06  <antimatroid> i guess they can get their best relative positions

2011-04-27T04:39:56  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: out of curiosity why shouldn't something like that be put in the engine?
2011-04-27T04:41:25  <sigh> to keep things modular and separate... it keeps the engine code shorter, and both parts can be updated independently
2011-04-27T04:41:53  <jaycobcoleman> alright, I would agree with that. It is just sort of something that's fun to see :) so it can go with replays
2011-04-27T04:42:04  <sigh> plus the engine is just there to run the game, this isn't part of running the game
2011-04-27T04:42:23  <sigh> also if you make updates to the stats stuff, it is easy to include without worrying about breaking the engine

2011-04-27T10:20:17  <antimatroid> this is more familiar
2011-04-27T10:20:27  <antimatroid> bhasker getting online and saying morning not long after midnight
2011-04-27T10:20:36  <bhasker> hehe :)
2011-04-27T10:20:39  <bhasker> its 7:20am here
2011-04-27T10:20:44  <bhasker> daughter keeping us up all night!
2011-04-27T10:20:47  <antimatroid> 12:20am here
2011-04-27T10:20:49  <antimatroid> haha :P
2011-04-27T10:20:57  <bhasker> she sleeps like an angel through the day
2011-04-27T10:21:13  <antimatroid> i am going to get great joy out of you not sleeping :P
2011-04-27T10:21:27  <bhasker> haha don't be surprised if you see me online at all odd hours
2011-04-27T10:21:35  <antimatroid> that's my job
2011-04-27T10:21:37  <bhasker> i think this is going to be a routine for a few months
2011-04-27T10:21:54  <antimatroid> she may settle into a routine
2011-04-27T10:22:00  <antimatroid> hopefully it's not a year :p
2011-04-27T10:22:07  <bhasker> yea lets see
2011-04-27T10:22:35  <antimatroid> do you watch modern family?
2011-04-27T10:22:37  <antimatroid> so well written
2011-04-27T10:23:22  <bhasker> nope
2011-04-27T10:23:26  <bhasker> is it on netflix streaming
2011-04-27T10:23:38  <antimatroid> i would imagine (don't have netflix)
2011-04-27T10:23:43  <antimatroid> it's worth watching
2011-04-27T10:23:47  <antimatroid> it's like good for anyone
2011-04-27T10:23:54  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-04-27T10:24:02  <bhasker> i forget you are in australia
2011-04-27T10:24:24  <antimatroid> i'm even on the island off the bottom :P
2011-04-27T10:24:31  <antimatroid> next stop antarctica
2011-04-27T10:25:22  <bhasker> hehe, i wanted to visit antartica last year
2011-04-27T10:25:29  <bhasker> we were in Chile all the way down south
2011-04-27T10:25:32  <bhasker> in punta arena's
2011-04-27T10:25:38  <bhasker> its like a 600 miles from there to antartica
2011-04-27T10:25:45  <antimatroid> ahah, i don't know how cheap that'd be
2011-04-27T10:25:46  <bhasker> but the damn cruise is insanely expensive
2011-04-27T10:25:52  <bhasker> 5000$ a pop
2011-04-27T10:25:55  <bhasker> or more
2011-04-27T10:25:56  <antimatroid> i've only ever been to new zealand, and that was like before i was 5
2011-04-27T10:26:14  <bhasker> i need to visit australia sometime
2011-04-27T10:26:20  <antimatroid> i saw a reddit post a while ago of a guy who drunkenly booked a trip for him and his gf to the north pole
2011-04-27T10:26:23  <antimatroid> that would be sweet
2011-04-27T10:26:30  <bhasker> heh
2011-04-27T10:26:36  <antimatroid> australia is awesome if you ignore the politics
2011-04-27T10:26:43  <antimatroid> which i do my best to
2011-04-27T10:26:48  <bhasker> who cares about politics
2011-04-27T10:26:50  <antimatroid> and the bogans/scum
2011-04-27T10:26:53  <antimatroid> i do!
2011-04-27T10:26:54  <bhasker> i never did when i was in india
2011-04-27T10:26:57  <antimatroid> well, in theory
2011-04-27T10:26:58  <bhasker> and i never do in US either
2011-04-27T10:28:28  <Frontier> you never cared about coruption in india?
2011-04-27T10:28:49  <Frontier> have no opinion on obama-care?
2011-04-27T10:30:44  <bhasker> well i do care about corruption in india but not like i lose sleep over it
2011-04-27T10:30:49  <antimatroid> Frontier: caring can be very infuriating
2011-04-27T10:30:58  <bhasker> and don't really care about obama care
2011-04-27T10:31:01  <antimatroid> for little gain
2011-04-27T10:31:05  <bhasker> i think the current system and obama care are both broken
2011-04-27T10:31:29  <bhasker> what needs to be fixed is the pricing
2011-04-27T10:31:38  <bhasker> the drug companies and the doctors charge insane rates
2011-04-27T10:31:47  <antimatroid> what needs to be fixed is the fact that politics is just a big popularity contest
2011-04-27T10:32:08  <antimatroid> you wouldn't make someone a doctor or an engineer just because they thought they could do a good job, no matter how pure their intentions are
2011-04-27T10:32:09  <bhasker> i can buy the same drug in India for a fraction of the cost since India has process patents and not product patents
2011-04-27T10:32:36  <antimatroid> our last pm had a degree in chinese...
2011-04-27T10:33:46  <antimatroid> (not saying that's easy to fix or that i have a solution :P)
2011-04-27T10:34:04  <mcstar> india supplies most of the online drug market
2011-04-27T10:35:13  <antimatroid> drugs/hospital supplies etc. are a good example of another thing i hate about "current society", everything is about squeezing the last bit of profit out of each specialised part of production
2011-04-27T10:35:16  <antimatroid> it's terribly inefficient
2011-04-27T10:35:27  <bhasker> hmm
2011-04-27T10:35:47  <bhasker> sadly india's medical system is going the same way as US,except drugs are still cheap
2011-04-27T10:35:53  <bhasker> but hospitalization costs are increasing rapidly
2011-04-27T10:36:06  <antimatroid> i don't really know about it here
2011-04-27T10:36:21  <antimatroid> it's generally pretty good though, everyone pays medicare tax of like 1.5%
2011-04-27T10:36:27  <bhasker> US pricing is nutty, like once i had a cut which was bleeding profusely so went to ER
2011-04-27T10:36:45  <antimatroid> yeah, i couldn't stand living in the US i don't think
2011-04-27T10:36:49  <mcstar> u mean commercialized insurance system?
2011-04-27T10:36:50  <bhasker> i was at the hospital for an hour  or so, got a local anaesthitic w/ a couple of stitches
2011-04-27T10:36:58  <bhasker> the hospital billed the insurance 1350$?
2011-04-27T10:36:58  <antimatroid> most of the people are fine, but the foreign policy and ridiculous laws
2011-04-27T10:37:11  <bhasker> with a 50$ copay from my pocket
2011-04-27T10:37:17  <bhasker> 1400$ to get a few stiches
2011-04-27T10:37:20  <bhasker> thats just insane
2011-04-27T10:37:32  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be surprised if australia didn't charge an insane amount
2011-04-27T10:37:54  <antimatroid> i had a filling at my uncles dentist surgery earlier this year which was like $800
2011-04-27T10:37:55  <bhasker> well luckily employer insurance policy is very good, i wonder what people do who don't have a good insurance or don't have regular jobs
2011-04-27T10:38:13  <antimatroid> but i dunno whether he charged the insurance company more cause he could or not, he doesn't make us pay anything
2011-04-27T10:38:25  <antimatroid> do you not read reddit?
2011-04-27T10:38:29  <bhasker> nope
2011-04-27T10:38:35  <antimatroid> they are presumably some of hte better "worse of people", they get screwed hard

2011-04-27T10:55:18  <Ice_Harley> they have beautiful language. They use dots only and understand each other

2011-04-27T11:13:09  <antimatroid> but it's like 1am
2011-04-27T11:13:38  <MatmaRex> it's 5 pm here, no excuses for me
2011-04-27T11:14:09  <antimatroid> i'm tempted to cook up a turkey breast snitzel burger anyway
2011-04-27T11:14:12  <antimatroid> but again, it's 1am :P
2011-04-27T11:15:20  <antimatroid> best burgers in the world though, fresh roll slightly toasted, turkey breast snitzel, bacon, lettuce, pepper, bbq sauce mmmmmm
2011-04-27T11:16:26  <bhasker> <-- is going to try potential fields based bot
2011-04-27T11:16:45  <antimatroid> fields based?
2011-04-27T11:16:54  <antimatroid> i'm really iffy on game trees again
2011-04-27T11:16:58  <antimatroid> there's so many ants
2011-04-27T11:17:34  <antimatroid> if you have 6 ants (3 enemies) in a partitioned game to run, that's worst case 5^6 states to check
2011-04-27T11:19:26  <mcstar> whats the vim shortcut for newline?
2011-04-27T11:21:18  <smiley1983> I just press return in edit mode... shortcut?
2011-04-27T11:21:35  <mcstar> i know theres one
2011-04-27T11:21:41  <mcstar> in normal mode
2011-04-27T11:21:44  <mcstar> ctrl something
2011-04-27T11:21:53  <mcstar> and u enter insert mode on a new line
2011-04-27T11:22:06  <smiley1983> antimatroid: I hadn't heard about it. I rarely switch on the TV and do my best to filter out all other advertising material. :) I like ths chaser, though.
2011-04-27T11:23:58  <smiley1983> This suggests 'o' for opening a new line in edit mode below current line: http://www.keyxl.com/aaa8263/290/VIM-keyboard-shortcuts.htm
2011-04-27T11:24:31  <smiley1983> insert mode, sorry
2011-04-27T11:24:52  <mcstar> wonderful
2011-04-27T11:25:01  <mcstar> i searched for crtl something :)
2011-04-27T11:25:10  <mcstar> but with vim its easier just a letter
2011-04-27T11:26:06  <mcstar> it seems my old samsung's escape is dying :(
2011-04-27T11:27:00  <smiley1983> You can probably remap it to some key you don't use, if such exists :)
2011-04-27T11:27:33  <mcstar> i will just plug in a new usb samsung when the old gives up

2011-04-27T13:00:51  <janzert> don't bother, real ants keep getting scared out of their wits everytime they approach a food and it turns into another ant. Then they just run around screaming their little heads off like it's the start of the zombie apocalypse or something

2011-04-27T13:02:15  <mcstar> once i read an article that they modeled the behavior of real ants
2011-04-27T13:02:21  <mcstar> to solve some optimization problem
2011-04-27T13:02:58  <bhasker> its usually network routing
2011-04-27T13:03:05  <mcstar> yes, it had to do with optimal IP packet distribution among routers
2011-04-27T13:03:08  <bhasker> there is an article on building self healing networks
2011-04-27T13:03:13  <bhasker> using ants
2011-04-27T13:03:20  <janzert> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization
2011-04-27T13:03:42  <bhasker> basically each packet leaves a trail on a route
2011-04-27T13:03:49  <bhasker> and other packets pick up the route
2011-04-27T13:03:55  <bhasker> based on how strong the trail is
2011-04-27T13:04:00  <bhasker> if the trail weakens
2011-04-27T13:04:00  <mcstar> oh yes
2011-04-27T13:04:07  <bhasker> then they reroute
2011-04-27T13:04:08  <mcstar> like real ants leave feromones
2011-04-27T13:04:11  <bhasker> yup
2011-04-27T13:04:45  <mcstar> how long will 1 contest last?
2011-04-27T13:04:49  <mcstar> 100 turns?
2011-04-27T13:04:52  <bhasker> ant modelling would have worked if the food didn't disappear
2011-04-27T13:04:56  <bhasker> after every turn
2011-04-27T13:04:56  <mcstar> or will it get longer
2011-04-27T13:04:59  <mcstar> ?
2011-04-27T13:05:05  <bhasker> i think thats not decided
2011-04-27T13:05:06  <janzert> 1 game? currently 1000 turns maximum
2011-04-27T13:05:11  <mcstar> oh
2011-04-27T13:05:13  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-27T13:06:22  <mcstar> i think i will write a FunBot too
2011-04-27T13:06:32  <mcstar> it will make smiley faces from the ants
2011-04-27T13:07:19  <mcstar> what do you mean "if the food didn't disappear"?
2011-04-27T13:07:42  <mcstar> when an ant eats the food it must diappear

2011-04-27T13:44:06  <bhasker> as in ant modelling relies on the fact that food sources don't vanish after one ant hits it
2011-04-27T13:44:23  <bhasker> here there is no guarantee that moving in the same direction will yield more food
2011-04-27T13:45:22  <bhasker> so laying trails are kind of pointless

2011-04-27T14:14:20  <mcstar> yes, its not a global optimization problem in a slowly varying envrionment
2011-04-27T14:15:06  <mcstar> as far as i can see, this problem is harder than 2010's
2011-04-27T14:15:46  <mcstar> because of the extra degrees of freedom represented by the square lattice, the positions the ants can take

2011-04-27T17:24:15  <Frontier> the puzzle where you have to draw a symbol from some page of yeesha's notes to get a baroh perform an action just long enough on top of a pressure plate to get you up to the next level was the kind of fuzzy puzzle I fear. it did not feel natural that i solve a puzzle, because some character's animation is played longer than another.

2011-04-27T21:21:38  <McLeopold> 86 and 87 had the same message, but had different changes, i thought
2011-04-27T21:22:14  <amstan> well.. i have no idea, he should make it clear
2011-04-27T21:22:25  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-04-27T21:22:29  <amstan> not make a ton of requests if you do a mistakes in the previous ones
2011-04-27T21:22:36  <amstan> they can close them just fien
2011-04-27T21:22:55  <McLeopold> I'm just going to pull both in and call it good, and request he roll up changes into 1 next time
2011-04-27T21:23:20  <amstan> McLeopold: they're the same commit..
2011-04-27T21:23:32  <McLeopold> 86 and 87 are different

2011-04-27T21:44:47  <jaycobcoleman> Oh it works quite beautifully now
2011-04-27T21:45:16  <McLeopold> jaycobcoleman: are you working on any parts of the project right now?
2011-04-27T21:46:57  <jaycobcoleman> nothing major
2011-04-27T21:47:22  <McLeopold> what languages do you know?
2011-04-27T21:47:49  <jaycobcoleman> a fair amount of python and a little C++, nothing remarkable in other languages
2011-04-27T21:48:29  <McLeopold> can you do the work to parse 'r' lines in the python bot?
2011-04-27T21:48:50  <jaycobcoleman> I thought sigh took care of it
2011-04-27T21:49:11  <jaycobcoleman> I'll check
2011-04-27T21:49:13  <jaycobcoleman> But if not then I will
2011-04-27T21:49:29  <McLeopold> oh wait, I did it :/
2011-04-27T21:49:37  <jaycobcoleman> haha
2011-04-27T21:49:39  <jaycobcoleman> silly
2011-04-27T21:50:39  <McLeopold> I did a quick hack job
2011-04-27T21:50:45  <McLeopold> I still am clearing the food list
2011-04-27T21:51:23  <McLeopold> maybe you could make it nicer, so that the food list contains all known food, with a flag to determine if the food is visible or not
2011-04-27T21:51:37  <McLeopold> so a bot could request only visible food, or all potential food
2011-04-27T21:51:55  <McLeopold> If you have time, of course :)
2011-04-27T21:52:04  <jaycobcoleman> You got it
2011-04-27T21:52:08  <McLeopold> thx :D
2011-04-27T21:59:57  <jaycobcoleman> McLeopold: Is there any reason that removing food needs a try, except statement?
2011-04-27T22:00:27  <McLeopold> yes, if an item doesn't exist in a list, remove will throw an exception
2011-04-27T22:00:34  <McLeopold> like I said, it was a quick hack jo
2011-04-27T22:00:36  <McLeopold> b
2011-04-27T22:00:41  <McLeopold> joorb
2011-04-27T22:01:34  <McLeopold> since you will get a bunch of 'f' lines, you need to know if they are new, or are already in the list
2011-04-27T22:02:31  <jaycobcoleman> So it's partly just to make sure people don't screw up their bot by messing with food lists?
2011-04-27T22:02:36  <McLeopold> then for food items in the previous list not mentioned, you can assume the are invisible, except if they match an 'r' line
2011-04-27T22:02:52  <McLeopold> uh...
2011-04-27T22:03:00  <McLeopold> the try/catch? no
2011-04-27T22:03:07  <jaycobcoleman> no I know what you mean

2011-04-27T22:03:50  <McLeopold> if you look at the def food(self) method, I return self.food_list[:], which is slice notation for copying a list
2011-04-27T22:04:03  <McLeopold> that is used so they don't mess up the internal bot data

2011-04-27T22:05:31  <McLeopold> I think you would want 3, food_visible, food_? and just food, which is both sets
2011-04-27T22:05:55  <McLeopold> unseen is kinda the term for stuff in the fog, but I don't like it

2011-04-27T23:26:00  <jaycobcoleman> on the map should we be assuming food is still there when we can't see it?
2011-04-27T23:26:07  <McLeopold> your code was quite nice, the only thing I saw was you did a comparision to True and False, which could have been dropped

2011-04-27T23:27:49  <jaycobcoleman> Do we have some sort of consensus as to which the map should reflect?
2011-04-27T23:27:55  <McLeopold> I think we would want another designator so you knew the difference
2011-04-27T23:28:45  <McLeopold> Food = -3, Invisible_Food = -6?
2011-04-27T23:29:09  <jaycobcoleman> sounds good to me
2011-04-27T23:29:13  <McLeopold> wait
2011-04-27T23:29:53  <McLeopold> food=-3, fog_food=-4, move water to -5 and unseen to -6
2011-04-27T23:30:06  <McLeopold> unseen doesn't make sense for the food function, now that I think about it
2011-04-27T23:30:24  <McLeopold> unseen implies you've never seen it
2011-04-27T23:30:32  <jaycobcoleman> :)
2011-04-27T23:30:45  <jaycobcoleman> does unseen have a purpose?
2011-04-27T23:30:54  <jaycobcoleman> I thought all squares were assumed land until seen
2011-04-27T23:31:11  <McLeopold> if you didn't want to assume that, you can use the unseen value
2011-04-27T23:31:19  <jaycobcoleman> alright
2011-04-27T23:31:31  <jaycobcoleman> You want me to make those changes then?

2011-04-27T23:32:28  <jaycobcoleman> it's perfect
2011-04-27T23:32:51  <McLeopold> the thesaurus says unseen does mean invisible...

2011-04-27T23:34:44  <McLeopold> the reason I want the 2 food values to be next to each other is to make some of the comparisons easy to write
2011-04-27T23:36:42  <jaycobcoleman> okay so what am I changing for designators?
2011-04-27T23:37:58  <McLeopold>  food=-3, unseen_food=-4, move water to -5 and unseen to -6
2011-04-27T23:38:13  <jaycobcoleman> alright, I'll pull in a couple minutes
