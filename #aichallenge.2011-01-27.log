2011-01-27T20:24:02  <amstan> i haven't checked actually
2011-01-27T20:24:16  <amstan> there have been 2 new users
2011-01-27T20:24:53  <amstan> probably a spammer, but..

2011-01-27T20:25:24  <amstan> see that dot, gmail allows this
2011-01-27T20:25:35  <amstan> you can use any combination of dots to get more email addresses
2011-01-27T20:25:41  <amstan> anyway
2011-01-27T20:27:11  <Prillicy> well, I google search new members and see if they're on any spammer sites
2011-01-27T20:27:26  <Prillicy> I could add more sites to the add-in, but I'm trying to keep it simple for the time being
2011-01-27T20:29:10  <Prillicy> the kiss method always serves me well
