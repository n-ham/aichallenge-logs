2011-09-04T21:42:35  <jmcarthur> i always miss mcstar
2011-09-04T21:42:57  <jmcarthur> @later tell mcstar US eastern time
2011-09-04T21:42:57  <contestbot> jmcarthur: I think that worked...
2011-09-04T21:43:26  <jmcarthur> @later tell mcstar i was awake when you tried to talk to me, but i was out and about in new york city
2011-09-04T21:43:26  <contestbot> jmcarthur: As you wish.
2011-09-04T21:58:09  <amstan> @seen mcleopold

2011-09-04T22:39:32  <McLeopold> hi amstan
2011-09-04T22:39:43  <amstan> hey
2011-09-04T22:40:19  <McLeopold> have we launched yet?
2011-09-04T22:40:25  <amstan> no
2011-09-04T22:41:06  <mleise> McLeopold: Hey!!! Work for you! Lot's of! But you knew that, right?
2011-09-04T22:42:39  <mleise> There were so many people here asking for stuff and informing us about bugs and I just referred them to you when it seemed to have anything to do with the engine, manager, worker or SQL
2011-09-04T22:43:20  <McLeopold> well, work took over my life for awhile, I'm almost back now
2011-09-04T22:44:11  <mleise> I can imagine. Even here with the challenge we realized how much you are involved when you took some time out.
2011-09-04T22:44:24  <amstan> yeah.....
2011-09-04T22:44:30  <amstan> McLeopold's the new jeff
2011-09-04T22:44:49  <McLeopold> as it disappears? :)
2011-09-04T22:45:08  <amstan> dissapears while ppl ask about him
2011-09-04T22:45:24  <McLeopold> I'm gonna try and stick around on irc more now
2011-09-04T22:45:32  <McLeopold> my goal is just 1 bug per day
2011-09-04T22:45:40  <mleise> @last --with McLeopold --nolimit

2011-09-04T22:46:01  <amstan> mleise: probably since i rebooted it
2011-09-04T22:46:15  <mleise> kk that function never did what i want anyway ;)
2011-09-04T22:46:38  <amstan> anyway.. we should probably launch soon then
2011-09-04T22:46:41  <amstan> this would be the time
2011-09-04T22:46:46  <amstan> since the term starts
2011-09-04T22:47:33  <mleise> Ok what about the complaint that bots are matched with and play on decreasing counts of opponents and maps
2011-09-04T22:49:02  <mleise> If you look at some bots you see they only play on two two-player maps. Or others are playing with a seemingly fixed set of opponents while there are others close to their rank that look like a good match.
2011-09-04T22:49:35  <mleise> maybe radibus reported that, I'm not sure
