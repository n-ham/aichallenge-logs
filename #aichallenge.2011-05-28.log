2011-05-28T11:11:46  <smiley1983> You can download the repo as an archive rather than through git

2011-05-28T11:14:31  <smiley1983> first step is to download the repo, either through git or from the "download" tab on the github page
2011-05-28T11:14:42  <smiley1983> Which OS are you using?
2011-05-28T11:15:19  <hjax> i did that earlier
2011-05-28T11:15:47  <hjax> im on windows 7, normally i dual boot it with ubuntu, but not atm
2011-05-28T11:15:56  <smiley1983> Okay, great
2011-05-28T11:16:13  <smiley1983> If it's extracted, go into the aichallenge/ants folder
2011-05-28T11:16:33  <smiley1983> are you on command line or GUI folders?
2011-05-28T11:17:09  <hjax> i can do command line if youd prefer
2011-05-28T11:17:37  <smiley1983> probably easiest, so you can see the errors (though I think there's a way to tell the .cmd to keep the window open?)
2011-05-28T11:18:33  <hjax> i got cmd open now
2011-05-28T11:18:37  <smiley1983> Once you've got the command line in the appropriate dir:
2011-05-28T11:18:46  <jbroman> Um . . . wow. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4QmpyfS3fM

2011-05-28T11:20:30  <hjax> lets see
2011-05-28T11:21:34  <smiley1983> oops, it should be \ not /

2011-05-28T11:26:16  <smiley1983> how much effort is it to try in ubuntu?
2011-05-28T11:26:51  <jbroman> hjax: Python version?
2011-05-28T11:27:06  <hjax> 2.5
2011-05-28T11:27:36  <hjax> a lot, id have to setup my partitions for a new dual boot
2011-05-28T11:27:37  <jbroman> I forget which version of Python first allowed using print as a function. I'm pretty sure 2.7 does, but it's possible 2.5 does not.
2011-05-28T11:27:55  <McLeopold> hjax: which version of python?
2011-05-28T11:28:03  <hjax> 2.5
2011-05-28T11:28:07  <McLeopold> oh, get 2.7.1 for windows
2011-05-28T11:28:07  <jbroman> I think in 2.5 you have to do: "print >>sys.stderr, whatever" instead of "print(whatever, file=sys.stderr)"
2011-05-28T11:28:38  <jbroman> McLeopold: Scrollback much? :P
2011-05-28T11:30:03  <McLeopold> I only made it to the pastebin :)
2011-05-28T11:30:51  <hjax> im installing 2.7 now, i normally use 2.5 anyhow, but replaced with 2.5 for the contest :/
2011-05-28T11:31:01  <hjax> i normally use 2.7*
2011-05-28T11:31:22  <McLeopold> we need to update the info page then

2011-05-28T11:35:16  <smiley1983> strange. Let me update my repo to see if something's changed, mine doesn't reference those files
2011-05-28T11:36:53  <smiley1983> Huh. I updated, and now I get the same error

2011-05-28T11:37:23  <hjax> lol its broken on the beta site too
2011-05-28T11:37:36  <hjax> my bot has been waiting to compile for 15 min
2011-05-28T11:38:06  <hjax> and hasnt played a game since 30 min ago
2011-05-28T11:38:18  <smiley1983> McLeopold: are you seeing this? I updated my repo and now the visualizer is broken :)
2011-05-28T11:38:36  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-28T11:38:48  <smiley1983> Frontier isn't here though
2011-05-28T11:40:21  <smiley1983> hjax: if you want to install some sort of Windows Git interface, I may be able to walk you through the process of cloning and then rolling back to a non-broken state
2011-05-28T11:40:46  <smiley1983> otherwise it'll be necessary to wait until they fix it
2011-05-28T11:40:52  <hjax> i can wait
2011-05-28T11:40:57  <hjax> i gtg anyhow
2011-05-28T11:41:03  <hjax> bbl
2011-05-28T11:41:03  <smiley1983> or perhaps you could just make some empty images with the right names in the right locations
2011-05-28T11:41:10  <smiley1983> Best of luck with it :)
2011-05-28T11:41:16  <hjax> thats what i was going to try :P

2011-05-28T12:00:23  <smiley1983> There's an OCaml package, I believe they're similar...
2011-05-28T12:00:36  <smiley1983> I don't think anyone's announced starting an F# package

2011-05-28T17:22:00  <Frontier> Lol there exists a simple JavaScript test case with an inner loop that runs 500 times slower on the otherwise amazing Chrome JS engine: http://files.myopera.com/emoller/blog/webkit.html
2011-05-28T17:22:58  <Frontier> Compare that in Firefox 4/Opera vs. Chrome/Safari. Chrome/Safari are 100 times slower :p
2011-05-28T17:24:05  <Frontier> Some argue that comes from optimizing to a single benchmark called SunSpider, while real world applications like this unzip algorithm fall behind.
2011-05-28T17:24:34  <jbroman> I'd imagine it's more a matter of all of the JS engines having some weak spots.
2011-05-28T17:24:43  <jbroman> I'm sure the V8 team is working on it. :P
2011-05-28T17:25:08  <amstan> i got 1800ms
2011-05-28T17:25:36  <jbroman> 12 ms in FF4 :P
2011-05-28T17:26:19  <jbroman> Something is probably just messing up V8's attempt to detect and optimize hotspots.
2011-05-28T17:26:39  <jbroman> (My guess is that this loop is falling completely under the radar due to some unusualy aspect in its structure.)
2011-05-28T17:26:50  <jbroman> Interesting that Nitro is affected too, though.

2011-05-28T18:03:19  <GreenTea> why it crashed, I don't know..
2011-05-28T18:03:20  <Frontier> It probably happens because it uses virtualization software that practically makes very little memory available to Java
2011-05-28T18:04:52  <Frontier> Java typically allocates 1GB of virtual memory, which is fine without that virtualization. But on the test server it is like allocating 100% of available RAM.
2011-05-28T18:06:44  <GreenTea> hope developers will fix this..
2011-05-28T18:06:49  <Frontier> no
2011-05-28T18:07:03  <GreenTea> why?
2011-05-28T18:07:20  <Frontier> The fix is to use other virtualization software or none at all :p
2011-05-28T18:08:23  <GreenTea> on previous constest there where no such problem. so I think it is possible to fix)
2011-05-28T18:08:54  <Frontier> It is not useful to force Java into 100mb memory max, which is the only way to 'fix' it for now by a developer.
2011-05-28T18:09:25  <Frontier> On the real constes bots will be written that may well use several 100mb of RAM.
2011-05-28T18:09:34  <Frontier> *contest
2011-05-28T18:10:28  <Frontier> I'd just wait until the contest starts and the real servers can handle Java's insane demand on virtual memory.
2011-05-28T18:11:57  <Frontier> To be fair the development team only found out about the problem with Java on the test server (donated by demerzel) when it was already in use and we tried to compile some Java on it.
2011-05-28T18:12:11  <GreenTea> I see all java bots are crushed somtimes..
2011-05-28T18:12:28  <GreenTea> It's a pity that it is no possible to see error lot
2011-05-28T18:12:50  <Frontier> The error would be "out of memory" I'm sure.
2011-05-28T18:15:16  <Frontier> McLeopold: I looked at my source code for error handling and it is all very generic. I'd rather not bloat it. That would easily double my error handling code at this point :p. Would it be ok for you to download the defective replay and just fix the length of the invalid command string?
2011-05-28T18:15:45  <GreenTea> maybe set "100mb memory max" for test server.. as workaround
2011-05-28T18:18:04  <Frontier> But that would be pretty much Roibos with vanilla, no more pure GreenTea... :(
2011-05-28T18:20:37  <Frontier> I also find the following in the server logs:  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 18 | at Ants.getPointType(Ants.java:303) | at MyBot.move(MyBot.java:104) | MyBot.doTurn(MyBot.java:164) | at Ants.run(Ants.java:347)
2011-05-28T18:21:00  <Frontier> I'm not sure if that is for the starter bot.
2011-05-28T18:21:34  <GreenTea> when it happen, now?
2011-05-28T18:28:30  <Frontier> actually yes, an hour ago or so
2011-05-28T18:29:00  <Frontier> oh that was your bot, haha
2011-05-28T18:32:02  <GreenTea> By the way..  java desctop java visualizer is not ready yet?
2011-05-28T18:32:49  <GreenTea> and game engine..
2011-05-28T18:32:58  <GreenTea> not find them in starter package
2011-05-28T18:33:20  <Frontier> No they are not there. We use the engine from the git repository.
2011-05-28T18:34:15  <Frontier> But you can download the http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer/visualizer.jar
2011-05-28T18:34:51  <Frontier> You run it as "java -jar visualizer.jar xxx.replay"
2011-05-28T18:35:14  <GreenTea> playgame.py  ?
2011-05-28T18:35:58  <GreenTea> o, thank you!
2011-05-28T18:35:59  <Frontier> that's the executable script yes. it depends on some more files in the directories
2011-05-28T18:36:51  <Frontier> You can also try play_one_game.sh or play_one_game.cmd. It will open a replay in your browser
2011-05-28T18:38:27  <Frontier> The only reason the desktop visualizer is ready is that I didn't code it from ground up, but just run the JavaScript inside Java using Rhino from Mozilla. That is why it is very slow and you may curse the visualizer.jar one day :p

2011-05-28T20:07:19  <Frontier> @later tell McLeopold: You can now load broken replays in debug mode. It would be good if you could see an ant's id on the board... hmm

2011-05-28T20:08:01  <McLeopold> cool

2011-05-28T20:23:26  <janzert> Can someone that has worked on the compiler module explain what safeglob is trying to protect against?
2011-05-28T20:24:58  <jbroman> janzert: I think patterns like "../*" and "/usr/lib/…"
2011-05-28T20:26:09  <janzert> jbroman: from where? the paths are all coming out of os.walk and the glob patterns given to it come from the language definitions within the module itself

2011-05-28T20:27:50  <janzert> also the SAFEPATH regex allows ".." anyway

2011-05-28T20:32:09  <Frontier> McLeopold: Now we can see clearly that the error appears when on start ants that survive until the player crashes/times out
2011-05-28T20:34:10  <Frontier> Here is the link for the lazy :p  : http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/stable/visualizer.php?game=9&row=86&col=8&turn=270&debug=true
2011-05-28T20:44:01  <CIA-48> aichallenge: Marco Leise epsilon * re9ca861 / ants/visualizer/js/Application.js : visualizer: added url option to override config (i.e. ...&config={"label":2}) - http://bit.ly/kVxSmu
2011-05-28T20:45:47  <Frontier> So much for overengineering: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/stable/visualizer.php?game=9&row=86&col=8&turn=270&debug=true&config={%22label%22:2}
2011-05-28T20:48:18  <Frontier> This loads 9.replay (game=9), ignoring errors in the parsing process (debug=true), zooms in on row=86, col=8 at turn=270 and shows global ids on ants (config={"label":2})
2011-05-28T21:04:46  <jbroman> Numbers should probably hidden once they're too small to read. But the visualizer is getting very impressive.

2011-05-28T21:09:54  <Frontier> jbroman: The point of showing the numbers even when they are too small is to show the user that they are active. If you zoom out and toggle them you would get zero feedback.
2011-05-28T21:10:28  <jbroman> Mmmmmm . . . okay, fine.
2011-05-28T21:10:36  <jbroman> I understand now.

2011-05-28T22:00:26  <qacek> hjax: I just print to stderr and use the -E flag with playgame.py
2011-05-28T22:01:43  <hjax> ? I tried having my program write to a file, it never wrote the first entree, which should have been right after it made the file :/
2011-05-28T22:02:20  <hjax> So my program keeps timing out and i have no clue why

2011-05-28T22:04:25  <hjax> qacek: do you know python?
2011-05-28T22:04:40  <Frontier> hjax: IO is usually buffered. You should check that you flush these buffers when you want a line to appear in your file.

2011-05-28T22:05:29  <hjax> Frontier: I've never had problems writing to files before :/
2011-05-28T22:05:30  <Frontier> This is done automatically when you close a file, but not when your program is terminated by the engine.
2011-05-28T22:05:43  <hjax> Moan :/
2011-05-28T22:06:20  <Frontier> In C++ you would write: out << "my entry" << endl;
2011-05-28T22:06:32  <qacek> hjax: I would just use stderr: print >> sys.stderr, 'Text'
2011-05-28T22:06:38  <Frontier> endl in this case adds a line-break and also makes sure the buffer is flushed
2011-05-28T22:07:31  <hjax> Here's my code if anyone wants to read it:  http://pastebin.com/m2GjWaMJ
2011-05-28T22:08:22  <Frontier> hjax: Either print to stderr, or flush the file buffer. You should be ok then.
2011-05-28T22:09:30  <hjax> Hmmm either way I can't try it until tomorrow :/
2011-05-28T22:09:41  <Frontier> It is only understandable that not every byte is written to a file at once. The computer can process large blocks of several kilobytes much more efficiently, so the bytes are kept in a buffer until there is enough data to write.
2011-05-28T22:09:41  <hjax> Thanks though :D
2011-05-28T22:10:07  <hjax> Frontier: makes sense, I'll go with printing then

2011-05-28T22:21:16  <qacek> thanks

2011-05-28T22:33:24  <qacek> what is ghc --version
2011-05-28T22:36:54  <qacek> amstan: I think I may need to do some stress testing, it looks like when the map is heavily populated things go bad
2011-05-28T22:37:23  <qacek> so I guess this can be postponed

2011-05-28T22:40:52  <qacek> amstan: that may be a problem, I'm using 7.0.3. The server seems to compile it fine though, are you using the same version as the server?
2011-05-28T22:41:26  <amstan> this is on the server
2011-05-28T22:42:06  <qacek> I'm confused then
2011-05-28T22:43:35  <qacek> ok it looks like the server is doing: ghc --make MyBot.hs -O -v0
2011-05-28T22:43:43  <qacek> maybe the --make is required for 6.12
