2011-06-03T02:00:49  <Frontier> amstan: I don't know about IE8. I upgraded to 9 to see if that works. Maybe Ice_Harley can check that. He has a Windows in a VM, probably with IE8. He told me though that the checks and crosses next to the player names aren't displayed correctly on Windows in Chrome and Opera. I'll have to replace them either with ASCII chars like 'S', 'E', 'C', 'T' or icons.

2011-06-03T03:03:51  <Frontier> or maybe it is just me who installed an open source font at some point
2011-06-03T03:06:49  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, they are all XP, but from different distributives
2011-06-03T03:07:27  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, let me check on other computer.
2011-06-03T03:08:06  <Frontier> Ah that may make sense. XP might just have been released before Microsoft decided to go with open standards.
2011-06-03T03:08:33  <Frontier> what other computer? do you have a Vista or Windows 7 pc around as well?

2011-06-03T03:11:05  <Frontier> Ice_Harley: As a test, could you do the following on your private Windows computer?:
2011-06-03T03:11:07  <Frontier> Click on "Start->Control Panel->(Date, Time, Language and Regional  Options)->Regional and Language Options"
2011-06-03T03:11:12  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, other winXP computer. It works...
2011-06-03T03:11:18  <Frontier> Click on 'Languages' tab (next to 'Regional Options') at the top
2011-06-03T03:11:28  <Frontier> In 'Supplemental language support', see whether "Install files for complex  script and right to left languages (including thai)" is kept ticked.
2011-06-03T03:13:22  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, no it's unchecked. I can't check it, it requires windows installation
2011-06-03T03:14:07  <Frontier> Yes, it installs wider Unicode support fonts :)
2011-06-03T03:14:09  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, does anybody except me have this problem? If no, just ignore me :)
2011-06-03T03:16:39  <Frontier> A few people with Windows XP may not have installed full Unicode support. Honestly I should work around that issue and use icons or something. I just don't want to work on the visualizer right now :p
2011-06-03T03:17:34  <berak> same problem here, xp, checkbox not ticked by default.
2011-06-03T03:18:36  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, i install those fonts support. I will check after reboot (how you say about windows and linux: reboot and be root)
2011-06-03T03:18:49  <Frontier> lol
2011-06-03T03:19:25  <berak> gahh, had to search the install cd for that, and will have to reboot (..later )

2011-06-03T03:31:38  <_smp> what version of mono are you using? in the web it says 1.2.6 but I think it refers to planet wars...
2011-06-03T03:36:26  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, that checkbox is not checked on other computer, where visualizer works
2011-06-03T03:39:05  <Frontier> Ice_Harley: that's ok. there may already be another unicode font installed. but does checking the box help?

2011-06-03T03:46:07  <Ice_Harley> Frontier, what font do you use for that symbols?
2011-06-03T03:54:23  <Frontier> I cannot tell. I setup the font for the latin letters, but the system uses installed fallback fonts to render symbols not included in for example Arial.
2011-06-03T03:55:05  <Frontier> You can write Chinese with Arial or MS Sans Serif selected, but it will eventually use some other font that is the fallback for Chinese glyphs

2011-06-03T03:56:04  <Frontier> I tried to find the font once, but this turned out to be more complicated than I thought. On linux there is some config file somewhere listing typical known fallback fonts.
2011-06-03T03:56:55  <Frontier> I don't know if Windows has something similar or actually goes through all the fonts until it finds a match ^^

2011-06-03T14:11:09  <Frontier> coffescript seems to crash sometimes, look at the replays
2011-06-03T14:11:41  <Frontier> Kingpin13: there are so many languages. Java, C++ are used too
2011-06-03T14:12:23  <Frontier> I use D. I'm sure you could port the Java starter over to C# :)
2011-06-03T14:14:10  <mcstar> my comment for the day is pffff.
2011-06-03T14:14:35  <amstan> mcstar: hmm? why?
2011-06-03T14:15:00  <berak> hmm, InsaneMalkavian submitted his last update 3 days ago, but still there's this ' (>")> ' line in the rankings
2011-06-03T14:15:12  <mcstar> reaction to Kingpin13's comment
2011-06-03T14:16:09  <mcstar> amstan: i dont recommend that you try setting the proc variables i discussed yesterday
2011-06-03T14:16:18  <amstan> mcstar: yeah, i got that
2011-06-03T14:16:26  <amstan> though, related to that
2011-06-03T14:16:37  <amstan> we're having issues running java and lisp things on that server
2011-06-03T14:16:56  <mcstar> i experimented with it, and it is working, but you have to have a high ratio, and it might just defeat the pupose of it all
2011-06-03T14:17:11  <amstan> since the server only has 1GB of ram, and another 1GB of fake ram(that might be taken at any time)
2011-06-03T14:17:14  <mcstar> yeah, sbcl needs 8GB overcommit
2011-06-03T14:18:08  <mcstar> you can invoke sbcl with --dynamic-space-size nMB
2011-06-03T14:18:24  <mcstar> nMB is a number
2011-06-03T14:18:41  <mcstar> have you tried runnig the cl starter on the beta server?
2011-06-03T14:19:01  <mcstar> is it 32 or 64 bit?
2011-06-03T14:19:06  <mcstar> cause that matters to
2011-06-03T14:19:08  <mcstar> o
2011-06-03T14:21:41  <amstan> 64

2011-06-03T14:23:25  <mcstar> then sbcl tries 8gb
2011-06-03T14:23:37  <mcstar> on 32bit its obviously less
2011-06-03T14:24:00  <mcstar> so i guess theres no active cl bot uploded
2011-06-03T14:24:24  <mcstar> i might upload mine then
2011-06-03T14:24:33  <mcstar> i just dont know how yet
2011-06-03T14:25:26  <mcstar> and amstan, only You with shell access can view the uploaded source code right?
2011-06-03T14:26:05  <amstan> anyone with shell access to the servers(manager+worker)
2011-06-03T14:26:14  <amstan> i wouldn't consider the beta server to be secure
2011-06-03T14:26:15  <mcstar> you as in You not just you
2011-06-03T14:26:23  <Kingpin13> Hi, sorry to be a pain - what would I use to test bots on my own machine? Like the visualizer PlayGame.jar we had last year? Or do we not have anything like that?
2011-06-03T14:26:26  <amstan> there's more ppl than just me
2011-06-03T14:26:41  <amstan> and we didn't bother too much with the api keys
2011-06-03T14:26:44  <amstan> so that's also insecure

2011-06-03T14:27:58  <UncleVasya> sorry, random move of finger near keyboard
2011-06-03T14:28:53  <UncleVasya> Kingpin13: you need to download whole Ants sourcefrom github. Link is in the topic.
2011-06-03T14:28:57  <mcstar> to UncleVasya's fingers: try obeying your master, fingers!
2011-06-03T14:29:04  <Kingpin13> Hmm, okay, I'm reading through some stuff now.
2011-06-03T14:29:43  <UncleVasya> Kingpin13: are you under Linux?
2011-06-03T14:30:10  <Kingpin13> Yeah, the stuff at the git always seems outdated though. No, Windows, trying to work with C#, but I do have mono
2011-06-03T14:30:43  <UncleVasya> Kingpin13: Under windows you have 2 ways to test your bot:
2011-06-03T14:30:53  <amstan>  no.. hold on
2011-06-03T14:30:56  <amstan> no need for all that
2011-06-03T14:31:04  <Kingpin13> I'm just downloading the "tools" now
2011-06-03T14:31:21  <amstan> Kingpin13: this should mostly work: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/using_the_tools.php

2011-06-03T14:35:14  <UncleVasya> amstan: can you or someone from the team kind a "certify" my utility for testing? Currently it's v0.2 and provide only nice gui for choosing play_one_game preferences.
2011-06-03T14:36:03  <Kingpin13> UncleVasya, are the sample bots broken? I just get status crashed crashed crashed crashed on the first turn :|
2011-06-03T14:36:06  <UncleVasya> amstan: I'm asking because people here awere awared that it can be a virus (it's a windows-program written in Delphi).
2011-06-03T14:36:13  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: are you worried you didn't understand all the playgame options?
2011-06-03T14:36:28  <mcstar> McLeopold: maybe a timed out/crashed bot should not have to be disqualified, if it succeeds to dominate the map lol
2011-06-03T14:36:49  <amstan> UncleVasya: do you have the source?
2011-06-03T14:37:15  <UncleVasya> Yes, I can give it to anyone. (Delphi 2010 project)

2011-06-03T14:39:09  <McLeopold> It's all about the score
2011-06-03T14:39:09  <mcstar> tbh i dont like the idea, its good for joking, but this aint right
2011-06-03T14:39:26  <UncleVasya> McLeopold: can't understand what you are asking about.
2011-06-03T14:40:02  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: I was asking if you wanted us the verify the correctness of the interface.
2011-06-03T14:40:34  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i dont want to discourage you, but whats the point? you cant possibly be more flexible with a custom gui then with bash
2011-06-03T14:40:53  <mcstar> (and faster)
2011-06-03T14:41:01  <McLeopold> mcstar: as long as he stays current with the playgame.py, it is useful
2011-06-03T14:41:10  <McLeopold> Some people just want to click things
2011-06-03T14:41:21  <UncleVasya> McLeopold: Maybe I will need it later when utility became more complex.
2011-06-03T14:41:26  <mcstar> whatever :)
2011-06-03T14:41:50  <McLeopold> Plus, a cache of common settings would be nice, which I don't plan on putting in playgame.py
2011-06-03T14:42:09  <McLeopold> Plus, playgame doesn't manage bots for you.
2011-06-03T14:42:22  <UncleVasya> yes, click things it's a right describe. I was very pleasured with Galcon Testing Arena for Planet Wars and decided to do something like this for ants.

2011-06-03T14:51:54  <mcstar> UncleVasya: if you are really determined to make a gui launcher, why dont you choose a dynamic language?
2011-06-03T14:52:07  <mcstar> for example python, which is i think more popular than delphi
2011-06-03T14:52:25  <mcstar> and has an ubiquitious interpreter
2011-06-03T14:52:28  <bhasker> ah potential, i tried it didn't work very well,
2011-06-03T14:52:36  <bhasker> ants were oscillating too much
2011-06-03T14:52:38  <Kingpin13> What version of mono will the official server be running?
2011-06-03T14:52:44  <bhasker> or would get stuck in a local maxima/minima

2011-06-03T15:04:43  <amstan> mcstar: that's a topic
2011-06-03T15:04:50  <amstan> the welcome message is another thing
2011-06-03T15:04:54  <mcstar> ok
2011-06-03T15:04:59  <UncleVasya> mcstar: If I'll do smething similar next  contest  I'll keep in mind your words.
2011-06-03T15:05:18  <mcstar> i mean the topic on the top side
2011-06-03T15:05:21  <mcstar> meant
2011-06-03T15:09:37  <mcstar> UncleVasya: im in no way a professional, but i do know that python is installed by default on osx and most of the linux distros, and its easy to install it on windows, plus you get immediately portability
2011-06-03T15:09:51  <mcstar> so i recommend that you soon learn python
2011-06-03T15:10:23  <mcstar> alright i shut my mouth for a while
2011-06-03T15:11:18  <UncleVasya> mcstar: I wrote console tic-tac-toe [3*3] on Python :)
2011-06-03T15:12:02  <amstan> UncleVasya: http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/
2011-06-03T15:12:06  <amstan> if you want gui
2011-06-03T15:12:44  <amstan> UncleVasya: get greghaynes onboard, he likes doing that stuff
2011-06-03T15:13:30  <amstan> oh.. right, someone should make an automated submission upload
2011-06-03T15:13:33  <amstan> that would be nice to include

2011-06-03T15:20:48  <amstan> why do you need wrappers for it?
2011-06-03T15:21:03  <amstan> just change playgame.py so it had nice opts

2011-06-03T15:21:20  <mcstar> or maybe that
2011-06-03T15:21:35  <mcstar> i just would like to improve my bash skills
2011-06-03T15:21:46  <mcstar> i only wrote a ssh tunnel manager in bash
2011-06-03T15:21:49  <mcstar> so far
2011-06-03T15:22:05  <amstan> you sound like computerwiz_222
2011-06-03T15:22:08  <mcstar> (except from trivial scripts)
2011-06-03T15:22:35  <amstan> i wouldn't write complex things in it
2011-06-03T15:22:40  <mcstar> maybe youz should elaborate a bit, im not sure what quality of my talk you refer to
2011-06-03T15:22:40  <amstan> bash is not for that
2011-06-03T15:23:14  <amstan> the "bash skills" part
2011-06-03T15:23:26  <amstan> he made a bitcoin miner manager/installer using only bash
2011-06-03T15:23:40  <amstan> actually, nvm, he used php as well
2011-06-03T15:23:52  <amstan> it was a client server model, his clients were all bash
2011-06-03T15:23:56  <amstan> reporting to the server using wget
2011-06-03T15:24:28  <mcstar> well, if it wasnt exremely slow i say go for it
2011-06-03T15:24:50  <mcstar> bash is not a curiosity language
2011-06-03T15:25:03  <mcstar> and got the whole gnu tools in its disposal

2011-06-03T15:25:22  <amstan> i feel sketchy when using it for complex things
2011-06-03T15:25:39  <amstan> it just gets more hackish as i add to it
2011-06-03T15:25:54  <mcstar> i think people dont use it because they dont understand it
2011-06-03T15:26:12  <mcstar> i dont mean that i do know it that well
2011-06-03T15:26:34  <amstan> it's just not designed for complex programs
2011-06-03T15:26:39  <amstan> it's a pain to maintain
2011-06-03T15:27:38  <mcstar> i read about powershell
2011-06-03T15:28:21  <mcstar> i dont really know why did i say that
2011-06-03T15:28:33  <mcstar> maybe cause its capable of more complex things
2011-06-03T15:28:44  <amstan> yes, powershell tried to make it a better language for complex programs
2011-06-03T15:28:48  <mcstar> it is not based on the pipes from the unix world
2011-06-03T15:29:02  <amstan> but the more you go toward that, the less good it becomes for general shell use
2011-06-03T15:29:10  <mcstar> the data thats passed from to programs can have structure
2011-06-03T15:29:14  *** aeter <aeter!~adr@93-152-185-81.ddns.onlinedirect.bg> has left #aichallenge
2011-06-03T15:29:27  <amstan> you want people to be efficient at using the shell, they shouldn't have to worry about long function names and syntax too much
2011-06-03T15:29:40  <mcstar> oh yes, that was terrible
2011-06-03T15:29:46  <mcstar> the syntax and the style sucks
2011-06-03T15:30:08  <mcstar> but the model might be a good step forward regarding shells
2011-06-03T15:32:21  <amstan> bash is also more of a tradition
2011-06-03T15:34:27  <mcstar> ?
2011-06-03T15:34:46  <mcstar> i mean there arent really any alternatives to it on linux are there?
2011-06-03T15:35:25  <mcstar> all the shells are built around a primitive namespace/variable model, with pipes and redirection
2011-06-03T15:35:55  <amstan> technically you could use python as a shell
2011-06-03T15:36:02  <amstan> but it's not pretty
2011-06-03T15:36:05  <amstan> same problem as power shell
2011-06-03T15:36:27  <mcstar> lets say technically you could write a pretty pretty shell in python
2011-06-03T15:36:38  <mcstar> not a bad idea
2011-06-03T15:36:53  <mcstar> i just dont feel motivated
2011-06-03T15:36:54  <amstan> the syntax doesn't allow you
2011-06-03T15:37:00  <mcstar> why?
2011-06-03T15:37:01  <amstan> you can't write unquoted strings
2011-06-03T15:37:12  <amstan> so.. "cd somerandomfolder" won't work
2011-06-03T15:37:21  <amstan> you might get away with the cd part(as print does in python)
2011-06-03T15:37:30  <amstan> but any arguments will have to be quoted
2011-06-03T15:37:35  <amstan> and comma separated or something
2011-06-03T15:38:12  <mcstar> ???
2011-06-03T15:38:19  <mcstar> sorry i doubt it
2011-06-03T15:38:34  <mcstar> its quite easy to write a parser
2011-06-03T15:38:45  <amstan> oh... you mean that..
2011-06-03T15:38:46  <amstan> i guess
2011-06-03T15:39:03  <amstan> no.. i meant of using python directly as a shell, maybe with some libraries to make it easier
2011-06-03T15:40:22  <mcstar> the shell's most basic function is to launch other programs
2011-06-03T15:40:32  <berak> hmm, you can add another affiliation from the sign-in page, but not from your profile
2011-06-03T15:40:41  <mcstar> so yeah, it wont be pretty in python
2011-06-03T15:40:57  <mcstar> but a simple parser would add some syntactic sugar
2011-06-03T15:42:15  <mcstar> amstan: are you sure that you cant handle name errors or whatever erro it spits when it encounters a foreign name?
2011-06-03T15:42:44  <amstan> you could, but that's ugly
2011-06-03T15:43:31  <mcstar> actually theres another shell
2011-06-03T15:43:35  <mcstar> its written in lisp
2011-06-03T15:43:44  <mcstar> can you guess what am i thinking of?
2011-06-03T15:43:51  <amstan> no
2011-06-03T15:43:55  <mcstar> emacs
2011-06-03T15:44:05  <amstan> i guess
2011-06-03T15:46:05  <mcstar> i printed emacs's reference card
2011-06-03T15:46:14  <mcstar> im a hardcore beginner now
2011-06-03T15:47:23  <mcstar> amstan: btw is the problem with kde still persist?
2011-06-03T15:47:36  <amstan> no idea, i just hard disabled composition
2011-06-03T15:47:46  <amstan> it's nvidia's fault, not kdes
2011-06-03T15:47:51  <mcstar> i havent used it since

2011-06-03T18:19:16  <bhasker> and my latest version is not getting a game at all:-\
2011-06-03T18:19:19  <bhasker> games are slooooow
2011-06-03T18:19:35  <olexs> 0.8gpm at the moment, not fast
2011-06-03T18:19:42  <bhasker> i really wonder if/when we do go live, bots might get games very slowly
2011-06-03T18:20:02  <olexs> there will be many more worker servers when contest goes live, much more computing power
2011-06-03T18:20:18  <bhasker> yea i know but i wonder how many we will need to get a good rate of games
2011-06-03T18:20:24  <bhasker> given that planetwars had over 4000 bots
2011-06-03T18:20:25  <bhasker> ^
2011-06-03T18:20:38  <olexs> well, in planetwars the game rate was ok-ish
2011-06-03T18:21:13  <olexs> ants needs much more computing power, but then we also improved the software behind the contest a lot
2011-06-03T18:21:27  <bhasker> lets see how it goes, this one should be interesting

2011-06-03T21:15:15  <synesso> hey amstan. I want to add a new param to https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/website/game_list_json.php - from_date
2011-06-03T21:15:17  <amstan> if you need the db it's going to be more complicated, if you just want some css, you could just git pull and put it up somewhere
2011-06-03T21:15:50  <synesso> If I can mock the data that would be fine. Thought it might be easy to install the whole kit, if it was scripted
2011-06-03T21:16:37  <amstan> you can, yes
2011-06-03T21:16:47  <amstan> but you'll need a ubuntu vm
2011-06-03T21:16:54  <amstan> or something equivalent
2011-06-03T21:17:08  <synesso> got it. wouldn't dev anywhere else :)
2011-06-03T21:17:32  <synesso> "you can" means I can mock the data, or install the whole kit?
2011-06-03T21:17:57  <synesso> And, I just need apache + php if I'm mocking?

2011-06-03T21:18:31  <amstan> there's setup script
2011-06-03T21:18:36  <amstan> but it'll take over the system

2011-06-03T21:18:54  <synesso> that's fine, i can get a new vm. sure

2011-06-03T21:19:29  <amstan> at the end you should have a working website

2011-06-03T21:20:08  <amstan> hold on, some stuff there is redundant

2011-06-03T21:23:12  <amstan> someone should really fix that
2011-06-03T21:23:17  <amstan> just make the page reload to the link
2011-06-03T21:23:20  <computerwiz_222> it's a beta server so.. meh
2011-06-03T21:23:21  <computerwiz_222> and yeah
2011-06-03T21:23:40  <amstan> synesso: did you already miss the link?
2011-06-03T21:23:45  <amstan> synesso: i'll have to do it manually if you did
2011-06-03T21:24:05  <computerwiz_222> amstan: the reason for the link is so that it is just 1 step harder for bots to create 10000 accounts
2011-06-03T21:24:12  <synesso> no worries, beta server. As long as you don't intend to migrate data, I'll just create a new account.
2011-06-03T21:24:21  <computerwiz_222> i think amstan is fixing it
2011-06-03T21:24:38  <synesso> cheers. Thanks for your help
