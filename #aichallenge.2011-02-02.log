2011-02-02T19:18:10  <McLeopold> 0.8mb
2011-02-02T19:18:41  <Zannick> i dunno
2011-02-02T19:18:50  <McLeopold> Maybe cause I gave it a link file?
2011-02-02T19:19:22  <Zannick> you could try uploading the image to a dedicated image host like imgur and just include the img in your post
2011-02-02T19:19:32  <jmcarthur> imgur ftw
2011-02-02T19:19:48  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-02T19:20:25  <jmcarthur> i'm guessing you added new hotness to the game
2011-02-02T19:20:40  <jmcarthur> i look forward to seeing it. anything to improve what i've seen so far... :)

2011-02-02T19:22:52  <jmcarthur> btw, i picked up my tron bot today to test it before showing off the code, and i found that it just utterly fails when i'm using the brainfuck scheduler patch for the linux kernel. i have no idea why
2011-02-02T19:24:09  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: wicked! is this with the idea about what to do with large battles?
2011-02-02T19:24:19  <jmcarthur> trying to make sure i'm understanding it right
2011-02-02T19:25:05  <jmcarthur> it's cool seeing them lock together like that
2011-02-02T19:26:09  <jmcarthur> the ai seems to be doing the wrong thing there. linking forces together rather than sending them to the point of conflict where they would actually help
2011-02-02T19:26:26  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I think I know why.
2011-02-02T19:26:53  <jmcarthur> are they just afraid to "let go" or something?
2011-02-02T19:26:56  <McLeopold> It's hunter bot, I think it just tries to move toward the enemy, but when it bumps against itself, the move fails.
2011-02-02T19:27:00  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-02T19:27:08  <jmcarthur> that makes sense then
2011-02-02T19:27:21  <McLeopold> this implements our idea of more ants win.
2011-02-02T19:27:39  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-02-02T19:27:54  <jmcarthur> i'm quite pleased with it. it looks like it does indeed change the whole game
2011-02-02T19:27:57  <McLeopold> the "locking" is just a side affect of hunter bot
2011-02-02T19:28:26  <McLeopold> It took about 10 sample games to get a good representation of how it changes things.
2011-02-02T19:29:02  <jmcarthur> ah, yeah, it probably would easier to show with a more sophisticated ai
2011-02-02T19:29:20  <jmcarthur> especially having it play against hunter
2011-02-02T19:29:23  <McLeopold> You can see black lose a lot of forces at the lower right to yellow because he sent them in a single line.  Yellow doesn't lose much.
2011-02-02T19:29:56  <McLeopold> a few moves after white is gone
2011-02-02T19:29:56  <jmcarthur> it's also interesting to see black holding off two huge lines of yellows because they weren't attacking properly
2011-02-02T19:30:14  <jmcarthur> only losing when a third force comes in from the side
2011-02-02T19:30:15  <McLeopold> yea, but ultimately doomed
2011-02-02T19:30:38  <McLeopold> If black was holding an objective, this behavior is desireable.
2011-02-02T19:30:43  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-02T19:30:58  <jmcarthur> well, but if yellow were more sophisticated it wouldn't have worked anyway
2011-02-02T19:31:28  <jmcarthur> this game requires planning for an attack, i just realized

2011-02-02T19:31:54  <McLeopold> I wonder if I can get 8 players in...
2011-02-02T19:32:39  <jmcarthur> screw 8. try 1000 :P
2011-02-02T19:32:59  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-02T19:33:01  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-02-02T19:33:08  <jmcarthur> maybe make the map a little bigger ;)
2011-02-02T19:33:24  <McLeopold> I'm thinking smaller maps might be better.
2011-02-02T19:33:26  <amstan_> McLeopold: what do you need? to integrate the changes from a fork back into the main branch?
2011-02-02T19:33:34  <jmcarthur> amstan_: check out his gif!
2011-02-02T19:33:46  <amstan_> jmcarthur: i saw, i don't get why they lock though
2011-02-02T19:33:52  <McLeopold> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1243&p=8558#p8558
2011-02-02T19:34:00  <McLeopold> That should explain it
2011-02-02T19:34:41  <McLeopold> amstan_: I don't think I need anything.  Just wanted to make you aware I forked the project.  I'm still learning github and git, so advice is welcome.
2011-02-02T19:35:07  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: what do you have in mind for the fair and random food spawning?
2011-02-02T19:35:13  <amstan_> McLeopold: well.. you did ask a qn about it, i can answer
2011-02-02T19:35:23  <jmcarthur> symmetrical food placement?
2011-02-02T19:35:25  <McLeopold> I've got some code written.
2011-02-02T19:35:32  <McLeopold> Not quite.
2011-02-02T19:35:45  <McLeopold> github has a gist, right?
2011-02-02T19:35:57  <jmcarthur> gist.github.com i think
2011-02-02T19:36:21  <amstan_> is the term "gist" used in other places as well?
2011-02-02T19:36:55  <jmcarthur> not that i know of
2011-02-02T19:38:09  <McLeopold> https://gist.github.com/808812
2011-02-02T19:38:21  <McLeopold> Okay, it works like this...
2011-02-02T19:38:53  <amstan_> McLeopold: fair and random? huh?
2011-02-02T19:38:54  <McLeopold> Let's say  you want 6 die rolls, but you want to make sure each number comes up once, because that's fair.
2011-02-02T19:39:25  <McLeopold> Or, with 2 die, there are 36 combos, and you want each once to be rolled once, because that's fair.
2011-02-02T19:39:47  <McLeopold> It's really just listing the numbers and then randomizing the order.
2011-02-02T19:40:16  <jmcarthur> ah, a shuffle
2011-02-02T19:40:31  <McLeopold> Then you can put other restraints on it, like an infinite number of die rolls, but when one number hasn't been rolled enough, it is "due"
2011-02-02T19:40:40  <McLeopold> and the algorithm inforces it
2011-02-02T19:41:07  <jmcarthur> so basically you're making the gambler's fallacy true
2011-02-02T19:41:07  <amstan_> so..
2011-02-02T19:41:11  <McLeopold> So, for Ant Wars, I would divide the map into sections that are symmetrical
2011-02-02T19:41:13  <amstan_> list.shuffle()?
2011-02-02T19:41:25  <amstan_> jmcarthur: yes.. i agree, fair doesn't mean it has to come up at least once
2011-02-02T19:41:26  <McLeopold> And then those sections would be subdivided.
2011-02-02T19:41:38  <jmcarthur> amstan_: well, i actually kind of like this
2011-02-02T19:41:53  <jmcarthur> amstan_: it means that there's a little bit of reasoning the bot can apply when looking for food
2011-02-02T19:42:06  <jmcarthur> amstan_: see a lot of food in one area and you can reasonably expect less food to appear there in the near future
2011-02-02T19:42:15  <McLeopold> Each section would then get a certain rate of spawned food, and the probability for an individual section goes up each time it is passed over.
2011-02-02T19:42:41  <amstan_> oh btw.. the guy that had cute ants artwork didn't want use to make use of them
2011-02-02T19:42:48  <amstan_> he was a little annoying for some reason\
2011-02-02T19:42:58  <amstan_> oh well
2011-02-02T19:43:00  <amstan_> zombies it is
2011-02-02T19:43:09  <McLeopold> pickmin?
2011-02-02T19:43:13  <jmcarthur> i could get my wife to make some ant art. she'd love some exposure, probably
2011-02-02T19:43:26  <amstan_> this guy had it already done, i liked how it looked
2011-02-02T19:43:32  <jmcarthur> link?
2011-02-02T19:43:52  <amstan_> idk
2011-02-02T19:43:53  <amstan_> let me find it
2011-02-02T19:44:40  <McLeopold> I'm thinking an initial placement of food should be symmetrical, but I'd like to avoid spawned food being symmetrical.
2011-02-02T19:44:59  <McLeopold> No good reason, other than aesthetics.
2011-02-02T19:45:45  <jmcarthur> i think semi-predictable randomness could make for some interesting AI, too, though
2011-02-02T19:45:48  <McLeopold> amstan_: btw, I really hope we don't pick ant wars.  I'm only doing this because I lost hope in anything else and I'm trying to make it not suck.
2011-02-02T19:46:07  <amstan_> McLeopold: well.. pick something
2011-02-02T19:46:14  <Zannick> McLeopold: jeff has said this is what he will likely pick :/
2011-02-02T19:46:35  <McLeopold> amstan_: I'm not the picker, jeff is
2011-02-02T19:46:54  <amstan_> http://www.johnny3d.promail.ca/iak/iak.png
2011-02-02T19:46:55  <jmcarthur> mutiny! ;)
2011-02-02T19:46:59  <amstan_> McLeopold: come up with better ideas
2011-02-02T19:47:11  <McLeopold> amstan_: I have
2011-02-02T19:47:13  <jmcarthur> amstan_: you mean come up with ideas that jeff will like
2011-02-02T19:47:21  <amstan_> jmcarthur: lol, sure
2011-02-02T19:47:30  <amstan_> but like! look at those ants
2011-02-02T19:47:32  <amstan_> i'm sad...
2011-02-02T19:47:34  <amstan_> http://www.johnny3d.promail.ca/iak/
2011-02-02T19:47:46  <McLeopold> If he would at least shoot holes in the other ideas, I would be more satisfied.
2011-02-02T19:47:54  <jmcarthur> hear hear
2011-02-02T19:48:02  <jmcarthur> there seems to be no rhyme or reason for picking ants
2011-02-02T19:48:44  <McLeopold> amstan_: so he drew this for the contest, but then doesn't want it used?  Or did he draw this for something else?
2011-02-02T19:48:55  <amstan_> McLeopold: somewhere else, sometime in october
2011-02-02T19:49:11  <amstan_> McLeopold: and i was hoping he would like us using it for ants if we do it
2011-02-02T19:49:19  <amstan_> but he didn't
2011-02-02T19:49:21  <amstan_> so.. i'm sad
2011-02-02T19:49:46  <McLeopold> Did you tell him this is huge and international and he would get big exposure as an artist?
2011-02-02T19:49:55  <amstan_> he didn't seem to care
2011-02-02T19:50:05  <amstan_> i did mention the 4600 entries
2011-02-02T19:50:11  <McLeopold> and google?
2011-02-02T19:50:21  <McLeopold> I wonder if galcon sales spiked last year?
2011-02-02T19:50:28  <amstan_> idk.. i can't really force the guy
2011-02-02T19:51:12  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I'm secretly morphing ant wars into stratego...
2011-02-02T19:51:35  <jmcarthur> please!
2011-02-02T19:51:44  <McLeopold> except the bombs will rocket ants across the map...
2011-02-02T19:51:49  <jmcarthur> we have to find a way to make a game out of this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNvSgQ-fJTM
2011-02-02T19:51:50  <Zannick> strantego!
2011-02-02T19:52:02  <McLeopold> is that a variant?
2011-02-02T19:52:15  <amstan_> gta lost me when they took planes otu
2011-02-02T19:53:31  <jmcarthur> but... but... the heavy bus mod!
2011-02-02T19:53:37  <jmcarthur> look at the awesomeness!
2011-02-02T19:53:44  <jmcarthur> this is the video that made me finally understand GTA
2011-02-02T19:53:59  <amstan_> jmcarthur: yep, that's pretty much it, lol
2011-02-02T19:54:09  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: looks like a simple prisoners delima problem...
2011-02-02T19:54:12  <jmcarthur> this is like a free-for-all burnout
2011-02-02T19:54:20  <McLeopold> or chicken
2011-02-02T19:54:41  * pgpaskar_ kersplodes
2011-02-02T19:54:43  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: Burnout has a mode where you try to create the most expensive wreck possible
2011-02-02T19:54:50  <McLeopold> yea, I played it once.
2011-02-02T19:54:53  <jmcarthur> you only get one collision yourself
2011-02-02T19:55:13  <jmcarthur> okay, anyway, i was just trying to lighten the mood
2011-02-02T19:56:50  <jmcarthur> i don't think the ants game is beyond saving
2011-02-02T19:56:56  <jmcarthur> as long as we turn it into stratego ;)
2011-02-02T19:57:37  <jmcarthur> or give them guns
2011-02-02T19:57:53  <jmcarthur> or something equally silly
2011-02-02T19:58:00  <amstan_> this was better: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6TVqtNZWBY&feature=related
2011-02-02T20:01:51  <McLeopold> eight player coming up...
2011-02-02T20:03:24  <McLeopold> eight player seems to last just as long...

2011-02-02T20:10:45  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: how about an ant throw move?  If your next to friendly, you can toss them 10 spaces?  Then you can start launching guys behind the lines.
2011-02-02T20:11:20  <McLeopold> You can setup a bucket brigade network of throwing ants.
2011-02-02T20:14:04  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: serious question: should the existence of water between 2 ants nullify the birth/death effect?
2011-02-02T20:14:36  <McLeopold> For instance, a single line of water, like a river, where there are ants on either side.
2011-02-02T20:16:54  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-02-02T20:17:04  <jmcarthur> i didn't realize those barriers were water
2011-02-02T20:17:15  <jmcarthur> took me a sec to realize that's what you were talking about
2011-02-02T20:17:34  <jmcarthur> i'd say that makes some sense, but what should the rule be exactly?
2011-02-02T20:17:40  <McLeopold> I didn't either until I read the code
2011-02-02T20:17:40  <jmcarthur> and more importantly...
2011-02-02T20:17:48  <jmcarthur> does it make the game more interesting?
2011-02-02T20:18:27  <McLeopold> If we have fog of war, with blocked vision, it would be odd for a food source to suddenly become an enemy ant.
2011-02-02T20:18:38  <jmcarthur> i'm still considering ant throws. i'm not so sure about that yet
2011-02-02T20:18:50  <McLeopold> It makes defense harder if you can cross barriers.
2011-02-02T20:18:57  <McLeopold> That was a joke.
2011-02-02T20:18:59  <jmcarthur> :P
2011-02-02T20:19:06  <jmcarthur> but a throw could get you across water!
2011-02-02T20:19:20  <McLeopold> Ant's can pick up 20 times their weight...
2011-02-02T20:19:38  <Zannick> but can they throw?
2011-02-02T20:19:45  <jmcarthur> there is an actual type of ant which will make bridges out of themselves so other can get across
2011-02-02T20:19:51  <jmcarthur> *others
2011-02-02T20:20:04  <amstan_> but will it blend?
2011-02-02T20:20:36  <jmcarthur> it might be interesting if an ant could walk into water, sacrificing itself, but then it turns into a walkable tile
2011-02-02T20:20:40  <McLeopold> http://answers.askkids.com/Life_on_Earth/can_ants_swim
2011-02-02T20:21:07  <McLeopold> so, the water is just a shallow wadding pool?
2011-02-02T20:21:19  <jmcarthur> well, you still drown if you step in it
2011-02-02T20:21:22  <jbroman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A042J0IDQK4
2011-02-02T20:21:25  <jmcarthur> but then you turn into land, essentially
2011-02-02T20:22:01  <McLeopold> Other species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water
2011-02-02T20:22:07  <jmcarthur> right
2011-02-02T20:22:13  <jmcarthur> that's what i was talking about mimicking
2011-02-02T20:22:36  <jmcarthur> (except this is an actual sacrifice whereas i bet in nature it's not necessarily)
2011-02-02T20:22:45  <McLeopold> It would be interesting to allow basic manipulation of the map.
2011-02-02T20:23:18  <McLeopold> you could have starting islands
2011-02-02T20:23:44  <McLeopold> I think I can code that fairly quickly, let me try...
2011-02-02T20:23:56  <jmcarthur> or you could have barriers that are relatively secured by water, but if your opponent builds up enough forces to sacrifice then that security goes away
2011-02-02T20:24:51  <jmcarthur> i'd really like to see this somehow turn into the sort of thing where you sort of set up a fortress of your own design and try to penetrate the other fortress
2011-02-02T20:25:07  <McLeopold> like minecraft?
2011-02-02T20:25:13  <jmcarthur> this water thing could be one side of the coin. the other side could be the ability to create barriers or something
2011-02-02T20:25:31  <jmcarthur> well, minecraft isn't really a "versus" game right now
2011-02-02T20:25:40  <McLeopold> dead ants remain and become blocking obstacles
2011-02-02T20:25:44  <jmcarthur> i don't mean quite like that anyway
2011-02-02T20:25:47  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-02-02T20:25:54  <jmcarthur> maybe
2011-02-02T20:25:55  <McLeopold> you can pick them up
2011-02-02T20:26:04  <jmcarthur> sounding better
2011-02-02T20:26:18  <McLeopold> you can throw them in water for your bridge
2011-02-02T20:26:22  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-02-02T20:26:26  <jmcarthur> maybe that too
2011-02-02T20:27:13  <McLeopold> it might be possible to turtle
2011-02-02T20:27:25  <jmcarthur> so... you can pick up a dead ant on an adjacent tile, then move around and set it on a tile adjacent to you later?
2011-02-02T20:27:30  <McLeopold> but then, the enemy could pick up your wall and move it
2011-02-02T20:27:34  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-02T20:27:39  <jmcarthur> as long as you can move *any* dead and it's okay
2011-02-02T20:27:44  <jmcarthur> *dead ant
2011-02-02T20:28:07  <jmcarthur> can you fight while carrying one?
2011-02-02T20:28:21  <jmcarthur> or spawn new ants?
2011-02-02T20:28:22  <McLeopold> heck yeah, ants are awesome
2011-02-02T20:28:35  <jmcarthur> what happens if you die while carrying one?
2011-02-02T20:28:42  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-02T20:28:53  <McLeopold> 2 dead on the same spot merge?
2011-02-02T20:28:57  <jmcarthur> and should the enemy be able to see if you are carrying one?
2011-02-02T20:28:59  <McLeopold> then you can get rid of dead ants
2011-02-02T20:29:51  <McLeopold> how about, can't die or birth while carring?
2011-02-02T20:30:19  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-02-02T20:30:24  <jmcarthur> or fight, to be fair
2011-02-02T20:30:29  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-02T20:30:34  <jmcarthur> i could see that
2011-02-02T20:30:50  <jmcarthur> i like that better because this prevents bodies from simply disappearing
2011-02-02T20:30:54  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-02T20:31:02  <jmcarthur> it means there's some gradual accumulation, and eventually you have to deal with it
2011-02-02T20:31:04  <McLeopold> but, should there be a way to remove bodies?
2011-02-02T20:31:14  <jmcarthur> nah, i like the map getting tighter over time
2011-02-02T20:31:38  <jmcarthur> kind of a "make your own map" kind of thing
2011-02-02T20:32:12  <jmcarthur> or...
2011-02-02T20:32:21  <McLeopold> I do like the idea, but it may be to complicated
2011-02-02T20:32:23  <jmcarthur> if there is a large body of water you can gradually convert it to land
2011-02-02T20:32:30  <jmcarthur> if you really need to get rid of bodies
2011-02-02T20:32:32  <McLeopold> true
2011-02-02T20:33:03  <jmcarthur> hmm...
2011-02-02T20:33:12  <jmcarthur> there's something more elegant hiding in here
2011-02-02T20:33:48  <McLeopold> what is that?
2011-02-02T20:35:12  <jmcarthur> okay, there's holes (formerly water), regular land, and walls (formerly bodies). you can dig up ground to make a hole and place it on regular land to make a wall on in another hole to make regular land. you can pick up a wall and move it around. if you place it in a hole you make regular land. dead ants become walls.
2011-02-02T20:35:27  <jmcarthur> and you can only walk on regular land
2011-02-02T20:35:46  <jmcarthur> s/on in/or in/
2011-02-02T20:35:48  <McLeopold> someone already gave a link to something like that
2011-02-02T20:35:53  <McLeopold> it had elevations
2011-02-02T20:35:57  <jmcarthur> yeah the snow thing. that was more complicated
2011-02-02T20:36:03  <McLeopold> no, not snow
2011-02-02T20:36:04  <McLeopold> ants
2011-02-02T20:36:09  <McLeopold> it was in python
2011-02-02T20:36:09  <jmcarthur> oh!
2011-02-02T20:36:16  <jmcarthur> it still had more than just three levels though
2011-02-02T20:36:35  <jmcarthur> and you could climb shallow hills
2011-02-02T20:36:39  <jmcarthur> in this you simply can't climb
2011-02-02T20:36:54  <McLeopold> yes, but I'd stick with water and dead ants
2011-02-02T20:37:00  * jmcarthur shrugs
2011-02-02T20:37:09  <McLeopold> You can't dig
2011-02-02T20:37:16  <McLeopold> so no creating water
2011-02-02T20:37:16  <jmcarthur> yeah, that makes some sense
2011-02-02T20:37:29  <jmcarthur> i just thought maybe this way would be overall simpler
2011-02-02T20:37:32  <jmcarthur> but maybe not
2011-02-02T20:37:38  <McLeopold> but that would be cool to dig a trench at watch it fill up
2011-02-02T20:37:43  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-02-02T20:38:03  <McLeopold> the picking up may need some work.
2011-02-02T20:38:08  <jmcarthur> okay, i'm game for sticking with the bodies idea
2011-02-02T20:38:17  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-02T20:38:22  <jmcarthur> there are some corner cases
2011-02-02T20:38:31  <jmcarthur> what if multiple ants try to pick up the same thing?
2011-02-02T20:38:31  <McLeopold> you must be next to a dead ant, and it takes one turn
2011-02-02T20:38:53  <McLeopold> if they are friendly, they fail
2011-02-02T20:38:54  <jmcarthur> i guess either nothing happens or the body is destroyed?
2011-02-02T20:39:01  <McLeopold> if they are enemies, they should already be dead
2011-02-02T20:39:08  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-02T20:39:11  <jmcarthur> nevermind
2011-02-02T20:39:14  <McLeopold> wait, no
2011-02-02T20:39:20  <McLeopold> they can have backup
2011-02-02T20:39:22  <jmcarthur> right
2011-02-02T20:39:30  <McLeopold> it just fails all around
2011-02-02T20:39:42  <jmcarthur> mmkay
2011-02-02T20:39:45  <McLeopold> its a tug of war, and the interested parties rest a turn
2011-02-02T20:39:52  <jmcarthur> back to sort of the original question...
2011-02-02T20:39:59  <jmcarthur> can you fight through walls and/or over water?
2011-02-02T20:40:12  <McLeopold> if we do this change, then no
2011-02-02T20:40:22  <jmcarthur> the rules are simpler if you can
2011-02-02T20:40:44  <McLeopold> yeah, they are
2011-02-02T20:40:55  <jmcarthur> the walls could still be movement barriers and just not combat barriers
2011-02-02T20:40:57  <McLeopold> how about birth and death must be a distance of one, so it's not an issue
2011-02-02T20:41:07  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-02-02T20:41:15  <jmcarthur> backup is a little less useful then though
2011-02-02T20:41:19  <McLeopold> or 1.6, so diagonals count
2011-02-02T20:41:46  <jmcarthur> that's reasonable i guess
2011-02-02T20:42:05  <McLeopold> well, I can change that real easy to see what it looks like
2011-02-02T20:43:10  <McLeopold> processing...
2011-02-02T20:43:32  <McLeopold> dead ants will really hinder the HunterBot
2011-02-02T20:44:00  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-02T20:44:29  <McLeopold> Have you seen the "dot dot dot" video about Super PSTW Action RPG?
2011-02-02T20:44:46  <jmcarthur> i don't think so
2011-02-02T20:45:01  <McLeopold> funniest thing I've seen in a long time
2011-02-02T20:45:16  <McLeopold> about video games, at least
2011-02-02T20:46:06  <McLeopold> distance 1.6 takes a lot longer to process, maybe because there are more ants?
2011-02-02T20:46:28  <McLeopold> dead ants will make spawning troublesome
2011-02-02T20:48:06  <jmcarthur> wow that video was great
2011-02-02T20:48:13  <jmcarthur> reminded me of how is babby formed
2011-02-02T20:48:37  <jmcarthur> doesn't spawning just replace the food with an ant?
2011-02-02T20:48:52  <jmcarthur> how would the dead ones mix it up?
2011-02-02T20:50:09  <McLeopold> I mean the placing of food
2011-02-02T20:50:19  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-02T20:51:21  <jmcarthur> i say just try to spawn the same amount of food, but if there's a body in the way then just don't spawn that piece. keep everything else the same. the tighter the map becomes, the less food there is
2011-02-02T20:52:23  <jmcarthur> i mean, i guess you could keep trying to spawn food, but then you would just have to do it more and more densely
2011-02-02T20:53:00  <jmcarthur> alternatively.... food can just replace a body
2011-02-02T20:53:12  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure i like that as much

2011-02-02T20:53:23  <McLeopold> me neither
2011-02-02T20:54:04  <McLeopold> that means, you can carry a bunch of dead ants over to the enemies side, and reduce his potential food production?
2011-02-02T20:54:09  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-02-02T20:54:42  <jmcarthur> and increase your own, since you're getting rid of dead ants from your side, presumably
2011-02-02T20:55:06  <McLeopold> that's not so bad
2011-02-02T20:55:29  <McLeopold> what happens if 2 dead ants are put on the same spot?  failure?
2011-02-02T20:55:34  <jmcarthur> hmm, just thought of something
2011-02-02T20:55:52  <jmcarthur> if ants carrying bodies are invulnerable, what's to stop me from turtling with *them*?
2011-02-02T20:56:34  <jmcarthur> failure makes sense for that case (2 bodies placed on same spot)

2011-02-02T20:56:48  <jmcarthur> although it has the potential to deadlock things further
2011-02-02T20:57:06  <jmcarthur> i think there needs to be a way to actually destroy bodies, and filling in water holes doesn't count
2011-02-02T20:57:43  <McLeopold> place off the map?
2011-02-02T20:57:50  <jmcarthur> how about placing two bodies on the same spot merges them?
2011-02-02T20:57:58  <McLeopold> yeah, I suggested that
2011-02-02T20:58:03  <jmcarthur> and that would also mean you can place a body on another body
2011-02-02T20:58:06  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-02T20:58:12  <McLeopold> that makes the no death while carrying go away
2011-02-02T20:58:18  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-02T20:58:27  <jmcarthur> i think that is indeed a bit nicer sounding
2011-02-02T20:58:49  <jmcarthur> but does that mean you should also be able to fight and create new ants?
2011-02-02T20:58:51  <McLeopold> then, a bot can keeps it's side clear for food
2011-02-02T20:59:09  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-02-02T20:59:19  <McLeopold> I would say yes

2011-02-02T20:59:40  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-02-02T20:59:44  <jmcarthur> it's simpler that way anyway
2011-02-02T20:59:47  <McLeopold> there is no penalty for carrying around a dead ant everywhere
2011-02-02T20:59:49  <jmcarthur> we need to keep it simple
2011-02-02T20:59:57  <jmcarthur> well...
2011-02-02T21:00:13  <jmcarthur> except that if you want to move another you have to set it down first, which i think we agreed should take a turn?
2011-02-02T21:00:26  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-02T21:00:36  <McLeopold> to move 2 dead ants takes 4 turns
2011-02-02T21:00:50  <jmcarthur> i think that's reasonable
2011-02-02T21:01:16  <McLeopold> you can setup a bucket brigade that would be effecient
2011-02-02T21:01:25  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-02T21:01:40  <McLeopold> they could maintain a defense line
2011-02-02T21:01:58  <jmcarthur> assuming there is a supply of bodies to use
2011-02-02T21:02:04  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-02T21:02:19  <McLeopold> the only way to break through is to carry off the wall
2011-02-02T21:02:32  <jmcarthur> you'd kind of have to have an *offense* line
2011-02-02T21:02:52  <jmcarthur> to carry off an opponent's wall
2011-02-02T21:03:13  <jmcarthur> lines are very ant-like :)

2011-02-02T21:05:55  <McLeopold> btw, this distance 1.6 is going to full 1000 turns
2011-02-02T21:05:59  <jmcarthur> wow
2011-02-02T21:06:21  <McLeopold> the enemy must carry it?
2011-02-02T21:06:29  <jmcarthur> what if the enemy already is carrying one?
2011-02-02T21:06:34  <McLeopold> they merge
2011-02-02T21:06:46  <McLeopold> like in other situations
2011-02-02T21:06:49  <jmcarthur> i don't know about this one
2011-02-02T21:06:57  <jmcarthur> just hand a body to an enemy? lol
2011-02-02T21:07:46  <jmcarthur> i think i would just be bikeshedding to argue against it though. i see no reason to pick one way to handle it over the other
2011-02-02T21:07:51  <McLeopold> if there is no penalty to the enemy, who cares?
2011-02-02T21:08:07  <jmcarthur> well, there could be a penalty
2011-02-02T21:08:14  <jmcarthur> if the enemy was a part of a bucket brigade :P
2011-02-02T21:08:23  <McLeopold> the enemy doesn't have to waste a turn to pick up an ant
2011-02-02T21:08:33  <jmcarthur> although i guess if things can just merge then it's no biggie
2011-02-02T21:08:49  <jmcarthur> in fact, no need for a bucket brigade to dismantle a big wall
2011-02-02T21:08:49  <McLeopold> yeah, he keeps doing his moves.
2011-02-02T21:09:02  <jmcarthur> could just use a few ants and have them merge all the bodies together
2011-02-02T21:09:06  <McLeopold> if you are carrying, and you pickup another, then they merge?
2011-02-02T21:09:19  <jmcarthur> i think that would defeat the purpose...
2011-02-02T21:09:24  <McLeopold> you can wipe out a wall,
2011-02-02T21:09:28  <jmcarthur> it's not really a great barrier that way
2011-02-02T21:09:31  <McLeopold> yeah, it would
2011-02-02T21:09:41  <McLeopold> so, no merging on back
2011-02-02T21:09:43  <McLeopold> of ant
2011-02-02T21:10:00  <jmcarthur> then what happens if you hand a body to another ant that already has one?
2011-02-02T21:10:07  <jmcarthur> actually
2011-02-02T21:10:17  <jmcarthur> no handing off of bodies?
2011-02-02T21:10:23  <McLeopold> I think the drop should just fail, friendly or enemy
2011-02-02T21:10:28  <jmcarthur> you have to put it down on the ground, otherwise it just fails
2011-02-02T21:10:32  <McLeopold> the ant is still carrying

2011-02-02T21:10:44  <jmcarthur> right
2011-02-02T21:11:21  <jmcarthur> interesting situation... two ants put bodies onto water at the same time...
2011-02-02T21:11:31  <McLeopold> merge into land
2011-02-02T21:11:31  <jmcarthur> create ground or create wall?
2011-02-02T21:11:38  <McLeopold> ground only
2011-02-02T21:12:14  <jmcarthur> this is a lot of cases
2011-02-02T21:12:56  <jmcarthur> it's still deterministic at least, i think
2011-02-02T21:13:19  <jmcarthur> there might be a reasonable way to describe the rules in a simple way
2011-02-02T21:14:38  <McLeopold> to dead ants to the same space merge first into one, then the normal action happens, water->ground or ground->wall
2011-02-02T21:15:05  <McLeopold> to pick up, you must be the only ant to try
2011-02-02T21:15:14  <McLeopold> to put down, you must place on water or ground

2011-02-02T21:15:26  <McLeopold> deat ants block movement
2011-02-02T21:16:29  <McLeopold> picking up or putting down or carrying don't prevent any normal actions from happening, birth, death, fighting
2011-02-02T21:17:14  <jmcarthur> seems reasonable
2011-02-02T21:18:20  <McLeopold> imgur only takes 2mb files! >:(
2011-02-02T21:18:24  <janzert> does a scenario with two live ants manipulating 2 dead ants such that one picks up and the other lays down to the same space on every turn make an impenetrable wall?
2011-02-02T21:18:28  <jmcarthur> the "merge, then action" rule seems arbitrary. why not just say that the action on water is to form land, the action on land is to form wall, and the action on wall is to just stay wall?
2011-02-02T21:19:00  <jmcarthur> which would mean that setting two bodies on water at once makes wall
2011-02-02T21:19:04  <jmcarthur> but the rule is simple
2011-02-02T21:19:27  <McLeopold> sure, either way
2011-02-02T21:19:43  <janzert> or more simply just have two of your ants always trying to pick up your wall
2011-02-02T21:19:44  <McLeopold> janzert: I would think yes, pickup resolves first, then laydown
2011-02-02T21:20:03  <janzert> locks the wall into place
2011-02-02T21:20:24  <McLeopold> janzert: yes it does, but it takes 2 ants, which can't move
2011-02-02T21:20:30  <McLeopold> a fair trade off
2011-02-02T21:20:38  <jmcarthur> i think it's not necessarily fair
2011-02-02T21:21:02  <jmcarthur> what if that's the only reasonable way to a majority of the map?
2011-02-02T21:21:04  <janzert> yeah, I guess it may or may not be fine. I think a little hard to say without trying it out
2011-02-02T21:21:19  <McLeopold> there are only 2 ways to block, water and dead ants
2011-02-02T21:21:22  <ssalbiz> amstan_: j3camero: met clifton from facebooks
2011-02-02T21:21:22  <jmcarthur> i guess that would imply map dominance already
2011-02-02T21:21:26  <McLeopold> both can be worked through
2011-02-02T21:21:32  <McLeopold> water can be turned into land
2011-02-02T21:21:37  <McLeopold> dead ants can be picked up
2011-02-02T21:21:39  <ssalbiz> he said something something facebook would like to sponsor prizes for next ai contest
2011-02-02T21:21:40  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-klsbaamnrrffcorl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-02T21:21:49  <jmcarthur> oooh
2011-02-02T21:22:30  <McLeopold> with 2 ants for a single spot, you can't have a wall
2011-02-02T21:22:45  <ssalbiz> he said something about how the legal team wasn't ok with facebook branding on the contest, since it conflicts with their own, but sponsoring prizes is cool with them
2011-02-02T21:22:48  <McLeopold> you can't get enough ants in there to keep it going
2011-02-02T21:23:03  <jmcarthur> yeah it only works for one space
2011-02-02T21:23:08  <jmcarthur> but it does work for that one space
2011-02-02T21:23:11  <jmcarthur> which may be enough
2011-02-02T21:23:26  <McLeopold> so is there an image sharing site that can take 3.1mb?
2011-02-02T21:23:29  <jmcarthur> if it's, say, a narrow corridor with water on the sides or something
2011-02-02T21:23:42  <jmcarthur> and you just stick a body at the end and double-tug
2011-02-02T21:23:58  <McLeopold> but, you can always suicide a bridge
2011-02-02T21:24:03  <janzert> McLeopold: not image specific, but dropbox?
2011-02-02T21:24:05  <jmcarthur> very costly
2011-02-02T21:24:14  <jmcarthur> but yes, still an option
2011-02-02T21:24:19  <jmcarthur> i say it's not *terrible*
2011-02-02T21:24:22  <McLeopold> if you have more territory, then it works
2011-02-02T21:24:24  <jmcarthur> since it's such a rare circumstance anyway
2011-02-02T21:25:54  <McLeopold> so distance 1.6 looks awesome, I just can't show you yet
2011-02-02T21:25:59  <jmcarthur> if you manage to get that sort of favorable situation then you probably deserve it anyway
2011-02-02T21:26:03  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-02-02T21:26:06  <janzert> dropbox sign up link http://db.tt/5kfMLHH (that gives me more space too ;) )
2011-02-02T21:26:18  <McLeopold> but how do I share just one file?
2011-02-02T21:26:41  <janzert> just put it in the public folder, then share the link to it
2011-02-02T21:26:47  <jmcarthur> http://www.mediafire.com/ requires no account, i think
2011-02-02T21:27:16  <jmcarthur> for a limited number of uploads
2011-02-02T21:30:23  <McLeopold> http://www.mediafire.com/i/?3qz5dooa3xdmdh9
2011-02-02T21:31:00  <amstan_> ssalbiz: hmm?
2011-02-02T21:31:04  <McLeopold> mediafire made that look like a crappy attari game
2011-02-02T21:32:22  <jmcarthur> hunterbot sucks for that :\
2011-02-02T21:32:53  <jmcarthur> it's also kind of as i feared. reinforcements don't tend to help as much
2011-02-02T21:33:08  <jmcarthur> i mean, obviously hunter is using the badly, but even s
2011-02-02T21:33:12  <jmcarthur> *even so
2011-02-02T21:33:20  <jmcarthur> *using them
2011-02-02T21:33:52  <McLeopold> yeah, a double line of live ants is unstoppable
2011-02-02T21:34:37  <McLeopold> it doesn't matter the distance we use
2011-02-02T21:34:40  <jmcarthur> you know.. with the bodies idea, this rule about not dying unless outnumbered might not be as nice
2011-02-02T21:34:44  <McLeopold> that thickness of line will be unstoppable
2011-02-02T21:35:02  <McLeopold> we could do a tie dies
2011-02-02T21:35:04  <McLeopold> more death
2011-02-02T21:35:05  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-02-02T21:35:08  <jmcarthur> i was about to suggest that
2011-02-02T21:35:15  <jmcarthur> still basically the same strategies, too
2011-02-02T21:35:22  <jmcarthur> flanking and such
2011-02-02T21:35:46  <jmcarthur> much less deadlocking though, which i think would be good
2011-02-02T21:35:58  <jmcarthur> deadlocks are the biggest risk with these ideas we're thinking up
2011-02-02T21:36:15  <jmcarthur> well, *no* deadlocking with tie dies
2011-02-02T21:36:19  <McLeopold> i'm trying it out now
2011-02-02T21:36:29  <McLeopold> that means 2 lone ants kill each other
2011-02-02T21:36:33  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-02-02T21:36:45  <jmcarthur> but 2 vs 1 means the 1 dies

2011-02-02T21:37:07  <McLeopold> hopefully, unless the bot name is 'McLeopold'...
2011-02-02T21:37:52  <McLeopold> still seems to be going longer...
2011-02-02T21:40:02  <amstan_> ssalbiz: cool, thanks, i'll forward
2011-02-02T21:41:35  <jmcarthur> so we might be the facebook ai challenge?
2011-02-02T21:41:38  <jmcarthur> :P
2011-02-02T21:41:58  <McLeopold> http://imgur.com/zUabI
2011-02-02T21:42:29  <McLeopold> it looks like deadlocks still, but that's just HunterBot
2011-02-02T21:42:40  <jmcarthur> wait, how does it deadlock at all? what's happening?
2011-02-02T21:43:01  <McLeopold> ooxx
2011-02-02T21:43:01  <McLeopold> ooxx
2011-02-02T21:43:10  <McLeopold> ^^ that should deadlock
2011-02-02T21:43:14  <jmcarthur> tie?
2011-02-02T21:43:32  <McLeopold> wait, no
2011-02-02T21:43:37  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-02T21:43:41  <McLeopold> I need to go.
2011-02-02T21:43:45  <McLeopold> I look at it later.
2011-02-02T21:43:58  <jmcarthur> alright

2011-02-02T23:02:12  <jmcarthur> if two ants on the same team try to move to the same position at once, one of them succeeds
