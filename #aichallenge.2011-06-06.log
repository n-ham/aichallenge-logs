2011-06-06T00:00:03  <amstan> jmcarthur: no idea
2011-06-06T00:00:11  <amstan> jmcarthur: people should use later tell more often
2011-06-06T00:00:15  <jmcarthur> agreed
2011-06-06T00:00:16  <amstan> or email
2011-06-06T00:00:42  <antimatroid> people should just idle
2011-06-06T00:00:59  <jmcarthur> i do, but then people just ping me instead of saying what they want to say
2011-06-06T00:01:14  <jmcarthur> or maybe you mean McLeopold
2011-06-06T00:01:19  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-06T00:25:31  <okayzed> To be clear, in trueskill the sigma does not always go down - if there is a match which is an upset or something similar, the sigma may grow
2011-06-06T00:26:04  <okayzed> And when a player is ranked first, there is no upper bound, so the sigma may grow as well, because their max skill level is uncertain
2011-06-06T00:26:28  <okayzed> (you are using trueskill, right?)
2011-06-06T00:28:06  <antimatroid> we are using trueskill
2011-06-06T00:28:14  <okayzed> they talk about it in the trueskill paper, the behavior you are seeing is not certain. and also, i'm starting to think trueskill is not a good ranking system to determine 1st, 2nd, 3rd
2011-06-06T00:28:20  <okayzed> but more of a good ranking system for matchmaking
2011-06-06T00:28:35  <antimatroid> what else would you use for multiplayer ranking?
2011-06-06T00:28:38  <antimatroid> bayeslo is out
2011-06-06T00:28:48  <antimatroid> i don't really understand any of them tbh
2011-06-06T00:28:56  <okayzed> i don't know, i'm wondering the same thing myself
2011-06-06T00:29:16  <okayzed> i think that having a tournament might be better than using trueskill
2011-06-06T00:29:34  <antimatroid> what do you mean by tournament?
2011-06-06T00:29:40  <okayzed> like, have one of those tournaments where everyone plays X games and then calculate standings from that
2011-06-06T00:29:46  <antimatroid> something resembling a round robbin is not possible and incredibly inefficient
2011-06-06T00:29:47  <okayzed> like they do for chess
2011-06-06T00:29:54  <antimatroid> there's too many bots
2011-06-06T00:30:00  <okayzed> i didn't say round robin
2011-06-06T00:30:01  <antimatroid> you're looking at 4000+ bots
2011-06-06T00:31:04  <antimatroid> i still like the idea of incrementally partitioning each section of the leaderboard and restarting a new tournament for each section
2011-06-06T00:31:12  <antimatroid> with final rankings determined in the final round
2011-06-06T00:31:28  <antimatroid> it means the final rank only really matters about how well you play against similarly ranked bots though
2011-06-06T00:33:17  <okayzed> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament
2011-06-06T00:36:16  <amstan> contestbot: later tell mcleopold please see above(in the logs)
2011-06-06T00:36:16  <contestbot> amstan: Ready to serve, my lord.
2011-06-06T00:37:46  <janzert1> I'd rather stick with a ranking system than a tournament system
2011-06-06T00:37:53  <janzert1> it gives us a lot more flexibility
2011-06-06T00:38:15  <janzert1> and so far seems to work quite well
2011-06-06T00:38:55  <janzert1> in either case I definitely do not want to change what we do between the open and finals portion
2011-06-06T00:39:03  <jmcarthur> i don't personally think trueskill is at all appropriate for determining a winner at the end. bayeselo might be better for that, or maybe a real tournament. for the bulk of the contest, trueskill should be good though
2011-06-06T00:39:10  *** Cyndre <Cyndre!~Cyndre@DOCSIS-181-75.cable-lynx.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-06T00:39:24  <amstan> we'll also do the pairings cutoff probably
2011-06-06T00:39:34  <amstan> so, it should get more accurate at the end
2011-06-06T00:40:17  <janzert1> trueskill is basically a modified glicko which has been shown to out perform elo pretty well
2011-06-06T00:40:31  <jmcarthur> bayeselo is not elo
2011-06-06T00:40:41  <janzert1> admittedly bayeselo may do better because it can operate on a global basis
2011-06-06T00:40:52  <janzert1> but we pretty much pushed the limits of that the last contest
2011-06-06T00:41:09  <janzert1> and yes I was typing that before your response ;)
2011-06-06T00:41:38  <janzert1> and generalizing bayeselo to a multiplayer game is certainly non-trivial
2011-06-06T00:41:44  <jmcarthur> definitely :(
2011-06-06T00:42:05  <jmcarthur> as is generalizing trueskill to bayestrueskill
2011-06-06T00:42:25  <jmcarthur> ;)
2011-06-06T00:42:29  <janzert1> :)
2011-06-06T00:42:58  <janzert1> and assuming the contest grows again I really don't think we can handle a non-incremental system of any kind

2011-06-06T00:44:05  <janzert1> or at least it needs to have better than the quadratic time in number of players that bayeselo has
2011-06-06T00:44:09  <jmcarthur> we might get to the point that we just run trueskill for the dev period, give them a day extra or so to stabilize, then pick the top n bots and run a tournament with them
2011-06-06T00:44:29  <jmcarthur> might seem unfair, but probably the best we can do
2011-06-06T00:44:41  <janzert1> which will be completely untested :/
2011-06-06T00:44:58  <janzert1> in a live situation at least
2011-06-06T00:45:11  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-06-06T00:45:36  <janzert1> that's the main reason I really don't want to change the way the tournament runs for the finals
2011-06-06T00:46:23  <jmcarthur> it's just a tough situation
2011-06-06T00:46:54  <jmcarthur> it means we have to make hard tradeoffs between fairness/correctness and stability and time/cost
2011-06-06T00:48:09  <janzert1> yes, I just believe that so far using a ranking system with some sort of progressive cutoff has worked really well at balancing the tradeoffs
2011-06-06T00:48:55  <jmcarthur> i can't argue with that. i'm just speaking of possibilities and ideals
2011-06-06T00:49:06  <janzert1> of course it's been nice that the number 1 player was so dominant the last two contest too :)
2011-06-06T00:49:40  <janzert1> it's hard for anyone to argue with the result that way
2011-06-06T00:50:06  <jmcarthur> that might be less likely with ants :\
2011-06-06T00:50:53  <janzert1> yes, I think so
2011-06-06T00:51:17  <jmcarthur> maybe if it's a bit ambiguous we could just round-robin the top n (for a pretty small n, like 10 or so)

2011-06-06T00:55:04  <janzert1> it just seems to open up too much room for arguing about the results
2011-06-06T00:55:42  <janzert1> also by narrowing the cutoff enough at some point it will basically become a roundrobin
2011-06-06T00:55:47  <janzert1> if we have to go that far
2011-06-06T00:57:03  <janzert1> we hit a technical limitation last time on the way pairing worked and how fast it ran that we couldn't lower the cutoff any further, but I think with the way pairing works now we should be able to bring the cutoff down to the point of a round robin if we needed to

2011-06-06T06:14:58  <antimatroid> your username seemed familiar though
2011-06-06T06:15:07  <Zaphus> lol, I was around for the last comp - was doing OK but life got in the way (company folded, had to worry about how to pay for food!)

2011-06-06T06:15:17  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2011-06-06T06:15:24  <antimatroid> things going better now?

2011-06-06T06:33:14  <antimatroid> i think the reason non-neon green ants are dying on turn 590 is colliding ants no?
2011-06-06T06:34:30  <antimatroid> does anyone know what the deal is with the water square with red behind it?
2011-06-06T06:35:27  <antimatroid> oh, i think that's where the link is going to?
2011-06-06T06:35:45  <Zaphus> it could be colliding ants
2011-06-06T06:36:45  <antimatroid> pretty sure it's all colliding ants
2011-06-06T06:36:48  <antimatroid> and there's no bug :P

2011-06-06T06:38:52  <antimatroid> one thing to check would be that collided ants aren't participating in battles
2011-06-06T06:39:07  <antimatroid> Zaphus: want to check that one out :P
2011-06-06T06:39:25  <antimatroid> just make a map where you can cause it to happen after one turn

2011-06-06T06:47:15  <Zaphus> I might have old c++ code, there is no clear() and there is no 'food' - it uses isFood
2011-06-06T06:47:24  <Zaphus> unless you just mean set it to false/0

2011-06-06T06:59:35  <antimatroid> oh, and then it'd be reset() where you want to clear food,
2011-06-06T06:59:55  <Zaphus> yeah,   square.reset()
2011-06-06T07:00:35  <Zaphus> except... I kind of like what you did, as a strategy - if I saw two bits of food, went to get one, it would remember the other and go look for it, thats kind of neat
2011-06-06T07:01:02  <antimatroid> lol, that starter bot is really broken

2011-06-06T07:01:42  <xQuasar> Does the server send all the information about what your ants can see, every turn?
2011-06-06T07:01:47  <Zaphus> whats the deal with the r anyway, if you can see the square you can see it has no food, otherwise you cant see it and won't get the r - is it purely to let the bots optimize a bit ?
2011-06-06T07:01:51  <xQuasar> If so, wouldn't it be more efficient to only send the changes?

2011-06-06T07:05:28  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  if 'r' was removed from the engine, then your bot code would keep thinking there was food all over the place, right ?  ahhh
2011-06-06T07:06:12  <antimatroid> Zaphus: 3... 2... 1...
2011-06-06T07:06:46  <Zaphus> impressive how high I got my bot with that in there :-)
2011-06-06T07:06:48  * antimatroid kicks CIA
2011-06-06T07:08:44  <antimatroid> ah crud, something messed up
2011-06-06T07:11:21  <locutus2> the last contest we have the ugly thing of climbing up the ranking for each new bot
2011-06-06T07:11:55  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-06-06T07:11:58  <locutus2> i see this time there are the ghost entry of last submission for better comparision
2011-06-06T07:12:00  <antimatroid> pw didn't have that which was terrible
2011-06-06T07:12:06  <antimatroid> i don't like that idea
2011-06-06T07:12:24  <antimatroid> it's good to make a new submission work it's way up the leaderboard
2011-06-06T07:12:38  <Zaphus> yeah, I like the ghosts...   but what happens when we have 4,000 ghosts ?  need a ranking page that has no ghosts for easy viewing
2011-06-06T07:12:40  <antimatroid> it encourages people not to resubmit as often and forces people to see how their bot does against lower ranked bots

2011-06-06T07:13:01  <locutus2> i have read the papers to trueskill and think we should for each new version start mit the last mean but the starter sigma
2011-06-06T07:14:12  <locutus2> because the bot has probably a similar strenght
2011-06-06T07:14:19  <antimatroid> that's better
2011-06-06T07:14:41  <antimatroid> not your comments sorry, my gitfu is poor
2011-06-06T07:14:44  <locutus2> but if this wrong through the high sigma for new bots this corrected very fast
2011-06-06T07:15:44  * antimatroid kicks CIA-26 again
2011-06-06T07:15:57  <Zaphus> problem with starting at the bottom is it discourages changes in the final weeks, since you may never make it back up to the top in time
2011-06-06T07:16:13  <antimatroid> the rankings are all cleared at the start of the contest
2011-06-06T07:16:38  <antimatroid> i submitted my bot for the first time in a month or so for pw an hour or so before the contest
2011-06-06T07:17:21  <antimatroid> the main server is a crap place to test your bot, it's just for bragging rights imo
2011-06-06T07:17:24  <antimatroid> tcp is where it's at
2011-06-06T07:18:20  <locutus2> also if we start a new version with old mean the trueskill updates for the other players in the same match a more realistic and not biased to the 'wrong' strength of the new version
2011-06-06T07:20:57  <antimatroid> apparently cia is dead :\
2011-06-06T07:21:39  <Zaphus> the problem with TCP is that I can't watch while at work.  Plus timeout / earlyout can only be tested properly on the main server
2011-06-06T07:22:00  <antimatroid> why can't you watch while at work?
2011-06-06T07:22:34  <antimatroid> it's going to be tough going back to non-live tcp games
2011-06-06T07:22:37  <antimatroid> <3 jbotmanager
2011-06-06T07:23:17  <Zaphus> I guess I could leave my PC on all day, playing TCP
2011-06-06T07:25:31  <Zaphus> does anyone have a TCP test server going yet ?

2011-06-06T07:44:53  <Zaphus> ah, the version of the playgame tools I have still have the 'r' support in them, I think - so it cleans up after itself

2011-06-06T07:46:27  <antimatroid> i had been holding off to change it till i fixed up the timer, but hadn't got around to it, so i finally did then
2011-06-06T07:46:29  <Zaphus> hmm - ok, then my code is really smart and it didnt get upset with the invisible food - because it makes zero difference to the behaviour of my (local) bot
2011-06-06T07:46:31  <antimatroid> it's a very simple fix though
2011-06-06T07:47:05  <antimatroid> Zaphud: you probably also want to add isFood = 0 to clear in Square.h
2011-06-06T07:47:12  <antimatroid> so 3 changes

2011-06-06T12:52:37  <olexs> hm, I have IE9 on my machine already, can't really test it. but activeX already sounds wrong, game viewer is html5 canvas + javascript, not activeX
2011-06-06T12:53:22  <olexs> add ?debug=true to your URL (&debug=true if the URL already has a ? in it) and see if anything changes

2011-06-06T12:56:05  <olexs> okay, doesn't work with IE and local content, it seems
2011-06-06T12:56:53  <olexs> what if you open a game from the beta server, like http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=15644 ? does that run properly?
2011-06-06T12:57:12  <guyverthree> just gonna open in in firefox from now on
2011-06-06T12:57:47  <olexs> that should do it, as well :) chrome has best performance in html5, firefox and IE can get slow on large games
2011-06-06T12:58:15  <mcstar> as for a sidenote: when i tried to view a game on win 7 with ie whichever.version it complained that a dont have Java installed and it didnt show anything but a nice errorbox

2011-06-06T13:00:14  <mcstar> Frontier: do you know anything about this?
2011-06-06T13:00:58  <janzert> older IE versions don't support canvas so it falls back to a java applet
2011-06-06T13:01:06  <janzert> not really sure what it does in IE9
2011-06-06T13:01:14  <mcstar> it cant be that old
2011-06-06T13:01:25  <mcstar> its from a win7 enterprise
2011-06-06T13:01:37  <janzert> IE9 was released just a few months ago
2011-06-06T13:01:39  <olexs> win7 came with ie8, ie9 came as an optional update
2011-06-06T13:01:39  <mcstar> so i guess it must be at least ie8 right?

2011-06-06T13:55:07  <Frontier> In the previous contest we had practically the same setup
2011-06-06T13:56:12  <guyverthree> I cannot seem to get a java bot to run a game
2011-06-06T13:56:24  <guyverthree> it's only the start bot one
2011-06-06T13:56:33  <guyverthree> it keeps crashing
2011-06-06T13:56:43  <guyverthree> i think i'm running the command incorrectly

2011-06-06T13:57:06  <itsme> Hi
2011-06-06T13:57:08  <mcstar> Frontier: thx for the clarification, however this doesnt concern me at all(not using windows), but might be of interest to some other ppl, cant you throw an error message like: the problem would be solved if you lazy bastard had installed IE9 :D
2011-06-06T13:58:10  <itsme> I'm using windows and I try to run the example on the tools package

2011-06-06T13:58:19  <Frontier> hehe when i coded that ie9 wasn't even ready
2011-06-06T13:58:29  <itsme> any clue??
2011-06-06T13:58:34  <guyverthree> itsme
2011-06-06T13:58:39  <guyverthree> i have the same thing
2011-06-06T13:58:42  <guyverthree> i had
2011-06-06T13:58:55  <guyverthree> you need tyo change the paths of the sample bots slightly
2011-06-06T13:59:21  <guyverthree> change the paths to this
2011-06-06T13:59:30  <guyverthree> python sample_bots/python/LeftyBot.py
2011-06-06T13:59:40  <guyverthree> basically remove the dst from the start of the tools thing
2011-06-06T13:59:44  <itsme> o it's true
2011-06-06T14:00:33  <Frontier> mcstar: The problem can be solved by either installing IE9 OR Java. I'm not sure IE9 is supported on Windows 2000/XP.
2011-06-06T14:00:54  <itsme> now it gave timeouts
2011-06-06T14:01:29  <mcstar> itsme: turn on debugging and see if the bots spit out some useful info
2011-06-06T14:01:29  <itsme> at least on second turn

2011-06-06T14:06:25  <mcstar> i think -E should make the bot errors appear in the console
2011-06-06T14:06:51  <itsme> the out it gave is:
2011-06-06T14:06:52  <itsme> $ ./play_one_game.sh running for 100 turns turn    0 stats: ant_count: [1, 1, 1, 1] turn    1 stats: ant_count: [1, 1, 1, 1] score 1 1 1 1 status timeout timeout timeout timeout waiting 2.25 seconds for bots to process end turn
2011-06-06T14:06:57  <mcstar> theres another one, -e which spits them out into files in a user given directory
2011-06-06T14:07:12  <mcstar> thats not it
2011-06-06T14:07:38  <mcstar> if the bot uses the stderr to print error messages, -E makes them visible
2011-06-06T14:07:55  <mcstar> otherwise, the engine doesnt show them
2011-06-06T14:08:09  <itsme> ok i'm using the defaults bots
2011-06-06T14:08:23  <itsme> it's the first time i have download the tools.zip
2011-06-06T14:09:12  <mcstar> are you trying this in cygwin?
2011-06-06T14:09:25  <itsme> yes
2011-06-06T14:09:29  <mcstar> (why cant a windows person answer his question anyway?)
2011-06-06T14:09:46  <itsme> because in windows native console the are problems with python
2011-06-06T14:09:49  <mcstar> ok, sure the path is correct to the bots?
2011-06-06T14:10:30  <mcstar> well theres a play_one_game.cmd which is supposed to be run from cmd

2011-06-06T14:12:19  <mcstar> maybe your python is simply old
2011-06-06T14:12:29  <itsme> is there any windows guy who have managed to run the examples??????
2011-06-06T14:12:37  <mcstar> you need at least 2.6 but i think 2.7 is recommended

2011-06-06T14:33:55  <janzert> McLeopold: I did reset the draw margin to 10% last night
2011-06-06T14:34:05  <janzert> just to stop the division errors
2011-06-06T14:34:07  <McLeopold> ok, I'm going to set it to 1%
2011-06-06T14:34:15  <janzert> why are you lowering it?
2011-06-06T14:34:20  <McLeopold> I'm checking the database for any actual draws
2011-06-06T14:34:22  <janzert> the actual rate seems higher
2011-06-06T14:34:43  <janzert> at least there was a divide by zero pretty much every other game
2011-06-06T14:35:52  <McLeopold> A higher draw margin makes bigger updates for a win
2011-06-06T14:35:55  <janzert> also the my range and average looked fairly healthy to me last night
2011-06-06T14:36:24  <janzert> err, mu not my :P
2011-06-06T14:36:41  <McLeopold> hmm... yeah, the rankings look a lot better
2011-06-06T14:37:02  <McLeopold> I think there is a slight error somewhere that makes skill drop over time
2011-06-06T14:37:57  <McLeopold> The draws are from games with only starter bots getting stuck in the same location.
2011-06-06T14:38:11  <McLeopold> I think the draw percentage will actually be lower, close to zero.
2011-06-06T14:38:15  <janzert> hmm, could be I see the average my is now 48.47, last night it was 49.xxx
2011-06-06T14:38:43  <McLeopold> I check some trueskill updates against the online calculator, and we are off
2011-06-06T14:39:20  <janzert> we'll probably always have a fairly good sized group of starter bots so I don't think the draw percentage will ever approach 0
2011-06-06T14:39:30  <McLeopold> I did see that someone said sigma may rise, so I was wrong there
2011-06-06T14:39:58  <McLeopold> But I'm not tuning the system for starters, I'm tuning for actual bots
2011-06-06T14:40:11  <janzert> I was wondering how much floating point rounding error we're getting with from some of the normal distribution functions
2011-06-06T14:40:21  <McLeopold> A win doesn't mean as much with a lower draw percentage, which is good
2011-06-06T14:40:31  <janzert> but the overall system has to account for the group of starter bots there will be
2011-06-06T14:40:44  <McLeopold> That might be the issues, the rounding.
2011-06-06T14:41:12  <janzert> adjust beta if you're trying to adjust how much a win means
2011-06-06T14:41:15  <janzert> that's what it's for
2011-06-06T14:41:40  <McLeopold> I was thinking about that.  I would like a feature where a bot is only active for maybe a week or so, then deactivated.  You'd have to log in and request more games to get reactivated.  That would drop out abandonded accounts.
2011-06-06T14:42:07  <janzert> yeah, I've thought about that before. I have mixed feelings about it
2011-06-06T14:42:08  <McLeopold> More games for people who are actually participating
2011-06-06T14:42:22  <McLeopold> what's the downside?
2011-06-06T14:42:44  <janzert> people get mad because there submission is dropped out of the contest?
2011-06-06T14:42:52  <mcstar> why dont you request users periodically to renew their bot status?
2011-06-06T14:43:00  <janzert> maybe with a clear explanation and an email when the deactivation occurs
2011-06-06T14:43:37  <McLeopold> It wouldn't drop out, just not be scheduled for games.  Plus, they can click one button to reactivate.
2011-06-06T14:43:51  <janzert> and there have certainly been top 10 bots that go for long stretches without updates
2011-06-06T14:44:06  <McLeopold> We can have a countdown timer for them, they don't have to wait to reactivate it, they can click everyday to keep it going.
2011-06-06T14:44:22  <janzert> but are you skewing the rest of the field by not then playing against them
2011-06-06T14:44:40  <McLeopold> okay, that could be a downside...
2011-06-06T14:45:13  <McLeopold> we could just take them out of seed rotation, but they could still be matched against
2011-06-06T14:45:26  <janzert> that might be work out
2011-06-06T14:45:47  <UncleVasya> In the last contest I saw some bots from september with rank near 300.
2011-06-06T14:46:00  <amstan> McLeopold: oh yes, have you seen that convo?
2011-06-06T14:46:04  <McLeopold> I think any potential minor downside is greatly outweighed by the benefit of removing starter bots from  playing
2011-06-06T14:46:39  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: I think my bot won the "longest stretch in the top 100" award :p
2011-06-06T14:46:57  <McLeopold> amstan: yes
2011-06-06T14:47:05  <janzert> I kinda like the idea of removing them from being seeds
2011-06-06T14:47:33  <McLeopold> It's already an issue, so I do want to do it.  I just also want the automatic removal so you have to be active.
2011-06-06T14:48:04  <McLeopold> so, back to my original point, draws aren't really happening among non-starter bots.
2011-06-06T14:48:22  <McLeopold> I think you are supposed to adjust epsilon, not beta.
2011-06-06T14:48:29  <McLeopold> beta is calculated from that
2011-06-06T14:48:54  <janzert> but the overall rankings parameters should be adjusted for the overall results, not just the high end results
2011-06-06T14:49:20  <janzert> beta is a measure of how 'random' the game outcome is
2011-06-06T14:49:21  <McLeopold> epsilon is supposed to be tuned for the game, not the contestants
2011-06-06T14:49:28  <UncleVasya> I think there should be a line (for example 15%+) after which bots can be deactivated after some time inactive.
2011-06-06T14:50:02  <UncleVasya> I mean that first 15% of the rankings will play even if their masters abandoned them.

2011-06-06T14:50:52  <amstan> i think rank should be proportional with their sigma
2011-06-06T14:51:10  <McLeopold> amstan: do you mean mu?  how?
2011-06-06T14:51:18  <janzert> given that ants seems to be quite sensitive to initial conditions (why non-symmetric food is a problem) I think beta is going to be fairly high
2011-06-06T14:51:21  <jmcarthur> is the trueskill implementation using floating point?
2011-06-06T14:51:26  <amstan> as in.. it doesn't matter if the guy near the end is uncertain
2011-06-06T14:51:51  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: it should, it's python
2011-06-06T14:52:03  <janzert> jmcarthur: yes it is currently at least
2011-06-06T14:52:04  <UncleVasya> btw, about sigma: is problem with it's lowering already fixed?
2011-06-06T14:52:23  <janzert> McLeopold: there are other fractional number representations available in python
2011-06-06T14:53:21  <McLeopold> janzert: what would be the most acurate type if we don't want rounding errors?
2011-06-06T14:53:34  <jmcarthur> i don't know what all the intermediate values in trueskill look like, but if we had the time to fiddle with it i would be tempted to look into a fixed point representation
2011-06-06T14:54:03  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I'll see what I can do and see if it then matches the online calculator
2011-06-06T14:54:10  <janzert> McLeopold: depends on what you want do, anything else will probably be much slower of course
2011-06-06T14:54:23  <jmcarthur> but i doubt anything like that is built in to python. we'd have to find a library or roll our own. also, to use it well, you need to always be aware of your precision and adjust depending on context
2011-06-06T14:54:29  <McLeopold> we want accuracy above speed
2011-06-06T14:54:32  <janzert> Decimal is probably the logical one for better accuracy
2011-06-06T14:55:20  <jmcarthur> is Decimal dynamic precision (and is it adjustible or automatic)?
2011-06-06T14:55:32  <janzert> jmcarthur: http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html
2011-06-06T14:55:52  <janzert> user specified precision
2011-06-06T14:56:04  <janzert> I don't believe there is any automatic adjustment
2011-06-06T14:56:18  <McLeopold> I'll max it out and see what happends
2011-06-06T14:57:19  <jmcarthur> so it's a global precision
2011-06-06T14:57:55  <jmcarthur> hopefully we don't use any libs that change it then...
2011-06-06T14:58:16  <McLeopold> score 1 for functional programming...
2011-06-06T14:58:19  <janzert> each number has a context specifying the precision among other things
2011-06-06T14:58:28  <jmcarthur> each *number*?
2011-06-06T14:59:04  <jmcarthur> ah you can create new contexts

2011-06-06T15:04:46  <jmcarthur> i good fixed point library will provide operations that adjust the precision to retain as much information as possible. i have one written in haskell that provides operations that give more claimed precision after multiplication and less claimed precision after division, for example. rounding (which by contract lowers precision) is always explicit then and you aren't caught by surprise
2011-06-06T15:05:35  <janzert> jmcarthur: talk to the IEEE and get it in the decimal specification and it will end in python ;)
2011-06-06T15:05:44  <jmcarthur> eh
2011-06-06T15:07:28  <mcstar> hm, come on 64bit floating point precision is enough for most applications, an bug is more likely to cause imperfections than precision problems
2011-06-06T15:07:48  <jmcarthur> it just depends
2011-06-06T15:08:20  <McLeopold> the more operations you have, the large the error
2011-06-06T15:08:27  <McLeopold> trueskill has quite a few
2011-06-06T15:08:39  <mcstar> i dont think that trueskill ranking involves numerical integration
2011-06-06T15:08:39  <jmcarthur> a 64 bit binary fixed point number can express any point from the sun to pluto to submicrometer precision
2011-06-06T15:08:53  <jmcarthur> with uniform precision
2011-06-06T15:09:05  <McLeopold> what about alpha centari?
2011-06-06T15:09:07  <janzert> mcstar: what is sum(0.1 for r in range(10))?
2011-06-06T15:09:19  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: for submicrometer precision you might need more bits ;)
2011-06-06T15:09:22  <mcstar> haha
2011-06-06T15:09:33  <McLeopold> but what is the precision?
2011-06-06T15:09:52  <jmcarthur> you mean what would the precision be for 64 bits from the sun to AC?
2011-06-06T15:09:56  <McLeopold> y
2011-06-06T15:09:57  <mcstar> thats another problem, representation incompatibility
2011-06-06T15:10:09  <jmcarthur> mcstar: huh?
2011-06-06T15:10:16  <mcstar> to janzert
2011-06-06T15:10:26  <janzert> or worse sum(0.01 for r in range(100)) - sum(0.1 for r in range(10)) :)
2011-06-06T15:10:49  <mcstar> im sorry to say but it is working
2011-06-06T15:11:03  <janzert> 7.7715611723760958e-16 ?
2011-06-06T15:11:20  <mcstar> janzert: that 0.1 cant be represented as a binary string is a completely different problem
2011-06-06T15:11:31  <mcstar> (finite b s)
2011-06-06T15:11:44  <jmcarthur> mcstar: about 2.3 millimeters of precision
2011-06-06T15:11:47  <jmcarthur> oops

2011-06-06T15:12:48  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: that is assuming that wolfram alpha is a reasonably accurate calculator and encyclopedia for this
2011-06-06T15:13:20  <McLeopold> only if they didn't use floating point....
2011-06-06T15:13:42  <jmcarthur> doesn't look like it
2011-06-06T15:13:55  <jmcarthur> these numbers seem pretty good (just tried it for pluto, too)
2011-06-06T15:14:09  <jmcarthur> i had already done the math for pluto when developing my fixed point library
2011-06-06T15:14:58  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-06T15:19:45  <jmcarthur> with 80 bits (the number of bits that extended precision floating point gets), fixed point can specify any point between the sun and alpha centauri to within 0.034 micrometers
2011-06-06T15:20:16  <mcstar> jmcarthur:why do you say that "with uniform precision"? it is correct that the sun-pluton distance approxmiated in microns is 6000000000000000000, and a 64 bit integer can hold a value as large as 18446744073709551616, nevertheless, the relatice accuracy of floating point numbers depend on the magnitude i.e. the exponent of the numbers in question
2011-06-06T15:20:27  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-06-06T15:20:35  <janzert> McLeopold: a quicker test than converting the whole trueskill module to use Decimal might be to re-enable the use of scipy and check the results with that
2011-06-06T15:20:38  <McLeopold> Chuck Norris can do it with 0.0037
2011-06-06T15:20:40  <jmcarthur> this is an advantage of fixed point precision over floating point precision
2011-06-06T15:21:03  <McLeopold> janzert: never used scipy
2011-06-06T15:21:29  <janzert> neither have I really
2011-06-06T15:21:50  <janzert> but looking at the trueskill code it was originally written to use it
2011-06-06T15:22:03  <jmcarthur> mcstar: well, i say it's an advantage, but it's really more of a tradeoff
2011-06-06T15:22:08  <janzert> just need to install scipy and uncomment the imports at the top

2011-06-06T15:22:24  <jmcarthur> mcstar: floating point is nice when you *need* to be able to work with potentially unpredictable orders of magnitude
2011-06-06T15:22:39  <jmcarthur> mcstar: otherwise, fixed point might be nicer
2011-06-06T15:23:16  <mcstar> i dont think you understand me
2011-06-06T15:23:26  <mcstar> im saying that precision depends upon magnitude
2011-06-06T15:23:35  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-06-06T15:23:41  <jmcarthur> with floating point
2011-06-06T15:23:51  <mcstar> but you said uniform precision in a previous comment
2011-06-06T15:23:54  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-06-06T15:23:58  <mcstar> which is misleadind i think
2011-06-06T15:24:01  <jmcarthur> i was talking about fixed point precision
2011-06-06T15:24:15  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-06-06T15:24:30  <jmcarthur> because floating point doesn't have that uniformity
2011-06-06T15:24:44  <mcstar> if you know the absolute magnitudes you can use fixed point sure
2011-06-06T15:24:51  <mcstar> it wasnt clear for me what did u mean then
2011-06-06T15:25:02  <jmcarthur> that is a very common case (knowing your range)
2011-06-06T15:25:27  <jmcarthur> e.g. it's common to do silly things like representing RGB components as floats in the range 0-1
2011-06-06T15:26:34  <mcstar> well, sometimes you want nan
2011-06-06T15:26:36  <jmcarthur> sure, you get a decent precision in that range compared to larger ranges, but you could do so much better with fixed point in this case (which people sometimes do without realizing when they represent a component as, say, 0-255 or 0-65535)
2011-06-06T15:26:50  <mcstar> with fixed point, it will cycle back
2011-06-06T15:26:56  <mcstar> or not
2011-06-06T15:27:31  <mcstar> btw i never heard of fixed point representation when i dealt with c
2011-06-06T15:27:49  <mcstar> is there a common one?(implementTION)
2011-06-06T15:27:55  <jmcarthur> C is one of the nicest languages to use fixed point in because you can take advantage of so many of the properties at a low level
2011-06-06T15:28:02  <jmcarthur> i have no idea
2011-06-06T15:28:07  <jmcarthur> i've only ever done it manually
2011-06-06T15:28:34  <jmcarthur> it requires a fair bit of documentation to keep track of it since C's type system doesn't express everything i would like it to
2011-06-06T15:29:22  <jmcarthur> s/documentation/comments/
2011-06-06T15:29:43  <mcstar> actually, its a good idea, using fixed point on the gpu, instead of the slower floating point units
2011-06-06T15:29:59  <jmcarthur> floating point is not necessarily that slow
2011-06-06T15:30:10  <jmcarthur> also, it's nice for stuff like HDR
2011-06-06T15:30:11  <mcstar> in many cases we know the ranges of our variables that we simulate
2011-06-06T15:30:30  <jmcarthur> the main benefit to fixed point on something like a GPU is lower memory requirements
2011-06-06T15:30:45  <mcstar> no, these have 64 bit fpu-s
2011-06-06T15:30:45  <jmcarthur> why use a float when 8 bits will do, for example
2011-06-06T15:31:07  <mcstar> it has to do with physical simulations

2011-06-06T15:31:34  <jmcarthur> 8 bits is fine for an RGB component intended for the screen

2011-06-06T15:32:07  <janzert> McLeopold: well using scipy, at least for the example in test_truskill.py, makes no difference
2011-06-06T15:32:12  <jmcarthur> but yeah, if you care about accuracy and know your range, fixed point rocks
2011-06-06T15:32:40  <McLeopold> janzert: can you see how it differers from the online calc?
2011-06-06T15:33:33  <janzert> yeah, at least for that example I see mu differs by as much as 0.2

2011-06-06T16:12:03  <mcstar> i will really try the GA stuff, if it wont work well, or at all, then ill give heuristics a try
2011-06-06T16:12:22  <mcstar> but i have to say it was quite pleasant to write the engine in lisp

2011-06-06T16:21:24  <jmcarthur> Frontier: well i was talking about C and fixed point. floating point is still floating point even if highly configurable
2011-06-06T16:22:26  <jmcarthur> i like that documentation. very precise
2011-06-06T16:22:58  <jmcarthur> and i love that D prefers purity even though it's an impure language
2011-06-06T16:23:00  <Frontier> I hate that documentation. Once it goes into classes, structs or templates you get totally lost :p
2011-06-06T16:23:14  <jmcarthur> well yeah. i just mean this floating point stuff specifically
2011-06-06T16:23:53  <Frontier> is there a pure language?
2011-06-06T16:24:11  <Frontier> how could you write anything meaningful without ever changing the outside world?

2011-06-06T16:37:21  <jmcarthur> purity doesn't even technically mean you can't communicate with the outside world, at least not by many definitions
2011-06-06T16:38:53  <jmcarthur> well
2011-06-06T16:38:57  <jmcarthur> let me rephrase
2011-06-06T16:39:11  <janzert> :)
2011-06-06T16:39:55  <jmcarthur> *purity* has to do with how the meanings of functions are derived from their parts, but doesn't not require that the *meaning* of those functions can't have anything to do with the outside world
2011-06-06T16:40:31  <jmcarthur> it's perhaps a subtle distinction, especially when looking at currently popular pure languages which aren't as different from imperative programming as they at first seem
2011-06-06T16:41:37  <janzert> seems I could extend purity to cover pretty much anything going from a definition that includes outside world state though
2011-06-06T16:42:07  <jmcarthur> janzert: exactly! the problem is that you then have to have a definition for outside world state. it's harder than it appears
2011-06-06T16:42:12  <janzert> but I'm certainly not a functional programmer by any means ;)
2011-06-06T16:42:15  <jmcarthur> s/definition/model/
2011-06-06T16:43:01  <mcstar> its soo nice that when i have a conceptually signifacant bug, the program still manages to run for a time, and appear to work ok, hm
2011-06-06T16:43:21  <jmcarthur> one of my biggest problems with haskell is that most haskell developers have accepted IO as *the* solution to communicating with the outside world. to me, all it does is give us an imperative DSL. the problem is that it doesn't have a precise model at all.
2011-06-06T16:43:49  <jmcarthur> so it's only "pure" if you just treat it entirely as a black box. kind of cheating, IMO

2011-06-06T16:44:38  <jmcarthur> it's still pure i guess.  getLine's meaning is just a big question mark. at least you can combine question marks and get other question marks.
2011-06-06T16:44:55  <janzert> hehe

2011-06-06T16:50:45  <Frontier> *sigh*, well I guess I like the definition where a pure function is simply one that doesn't depend on or modify anything outside of its scope.
2011-06-06T16:51:52  <Frontier> although the generalization sounds good on second thought
2011-06-06T16:52:38  <jmcarthur> well, your definition sounds about the same as mine. the *meaning* of a pure function doesn't depend on or modify anything outside of scope
2011-06-06T16:54:10  <jmcarthur> because purity can be taken to mean different things, i use "denotative" to describe the kind of thing i'm talking about
2011-06-06T16:54:29  <jmcarthur> which has a precise meaning

2011-06-06T16:55:27  <jmcarthur> in a denotative language, expressions can be made up of subexpressions, each subexpression is associated with a meaning (like a mathematical object, a number, a function, etc.), and the meaning of an expression depends only on the meanings of its subexpressions
